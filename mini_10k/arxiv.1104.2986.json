Rotational properties of late-type low-mass members of associations of known age provide a fundamental\nsource of information on stellar internal structure and its evolution.\nAims. We aim at determining the rotational and magnetic-related activity properties of stars at different stages of\nevolution. We focus our attention primarily on members of young stellar associations of known ages. Specifically, we\nextend our previous analysis in Paper I (Messina et al. 2010, A&A 520, A15) to 3 additional young stellar associations\nbeyond 100 pc and with ages in the range 6-40 Myr: \u01eb Chamaeleontis (\u223c6 Myr), Octans (\u223c20 Myr), and Argus (\u223c40\nMyr). Additional rotational data of \u03b7 Chamaeleontis and IC 2391 clusters are also considered.\nMethods. Rotational periods were determined by applying the Lomb-Scargle periodogram technique to photometric time-series data obtained by the All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) and the Wide Angle Search for Planets\n(SuperWASP) archives. The magnetic activity level was derived from the amplitude of the V light curves.\nResults. We detected the rotational modulation and measured the rotation periods of 56 stars for the first time, confirmed 11 and revised 3 rotation periods already known from the literature. Adding the periods of 10 additional stars\nretrieved from the literature we determined a sample of 80 periodic stars at ages of \u223c6, \u223c20, and \u223c40 Myr. Using the\nSuperWASP data we also revisited some of the targets studied in Paper I.\nConclusions. With the present study we have completed the analysis of the rotational properties of the late-type members of all known young loose associations in the solar neighbourhood. Considering also the results of Paper I, we have\nderived the rotation periods of 241 targets: 171 confirmed, 44 likely, 26 uncertain. The period of the remaining 50 stars\nknown to be part of loose associations still remains unknown. The rotation period distributions we provided in the\n0.8-1.2 M\u2299 mass range span nine different ages from 1 to \u223c 100 Myr. This rotation period catalogue, and specifically\nthe new information presented in this paper at \u223c6, 20, and 40 Myr, contributes significantly to a better observational\ndescription of the angular momentum evolution of young stars. The results of the angular momentum evolution model\nbased on this period database will@ be presented in forthcoming papers.\nKey words.

The\nidentifications of young nearby stellar loose associations\n(e.g., Torres et al. 2008; Zuckerman & Song 2004, and references therein) have further extended the homogeneous stellar samples on which the early phases of stellar evolution\ncan be investigated effectively. Nearby young associations\nare valuable targets for the characterisation of the stellar\nrotation and of the link with other stellar and environment\nproperties.

Such\nsystems are targets of several dedicated studies like spectral\ncharacterisation and searches for planets and circumstellar\ndiscs (e.g. Torres et al. 2006; Setiawan et al. 2008; Chauvin\net al. 2010; Carpenter et al. 2009).\nIn recent years, a number of valuable monitoring\nprojects of young and intermediate-age open clusters (see,\ne.g., Herbst & Mundt 2005; Herbst et al. 2007; Hodgkin et\nal. 2006; von Braun et al. 2005) have provided enough data\nfor statistical analyses of the rotational evolution of solarlike stars. Irwin & Bouvier (2009) report a compilation of\n3100 period measurements available then. More recent measures of photometric rotation periods include those of 575\nstars in M37 by Hartman et al. (2009), 368 Pleiades stars\nby Hartman et al. (2010), 122 stars in M37 by Messina et\nal. (2008), 38 stars in M11 by Messina et al. (2010a), 46\nstars in Coma Berenicis by Collier Cameron et al. (2009),\nand 55 stars in M34 by James et al. (2010). Extensive survey work in clusters at 1-2 Myr, mainly the Orion Nebula\nCluster (ONC) and NGC 2264, have established the initial\ndistribution of rotation rates in low-mass stars (Stassun et\nal. 1999; Herbst et al. 2001; Rebull 2001; Makidon et al.\n2004; Lamm et al. 2004). Herbst & Mundt (2005) estimate\nthat 50-60% of the stars on convective tracks are released\nfrom any locking mechanisms very early on and spin-up\nas a consequence of their contraction in the pre-main sequence (PMS), and these stars account for the rapidly rotating young main sequence stars. The other 40-50% lose\nsubstantial amounts of angular momentum during the first\nfew million years, and end up as slowly rotating main sequence stars. The duration of the rapid angular momentum\nloss phase is \u223c5-6 Myr, which is roughly consistent with the\nlifetime of discs estimated from infrared surveys of young\nclusters. This supports the hypothesis that the interaction\nwith a circumstellar disc drains angular momentum from\nthe star, thus delaying its spin up for the (variable) duration of its lifetime (e.g., Haisch et al. 2001). This process is\nnot understood in detail yet (see, e.g., Collier Cameron &\nCampbell 1993; Shu et al. 1994; Matt et al. 2010) and is usually modelled by means of very simplified assumptions, e.g.,\nthe disc-locking hypothesis (K\u00f6enigl 1991; Collier Cameron\net al. 1995) or accretion-driven stellar wind (e.g., Matt &\nPudritz 1995).\nThe initial distribution of rotation rates and the strong\nrotational regulation in the first \u223c5Myr are deemed responsible for the dispersion of rotation periods at a given mass\nseen in individual young clusters from the PMS until the\nage of the Hyades. For the Hyades, a narrow correlation\nbetween the B\u2212V colours and the rotation periods of F, G,\nand K stars has been found (Radick et al. 1987). A small\nscatter of the individual stellar rotation rates about the\nmean period-colour relation has also been found on M37\n(Messina et al. 2008; Hartman et al. 2009), M35 (Meibom,\n\nLate-type\nMembers\n30\n12\n57\n\nPeriodic\nMembers\n14(25)\n8(10)\n23(45)\n\nLiterature\nPeriod\n9\n0\n1\n\nNew Period\n(+Revised)\n10 (+2)\n9 (+0)\n37 (+1)\n\nMathieu, & Stassun 2009), and Coma Berenicess (Collier\nCameron et al. 2009). The convergence of the spin rates\nin \u223c600 Myr is a consequence of the strong dependence\non stellar rotation rate of the angular momentum loss via a\nthermally driven magnetically channelled wind (e.g., Mestel\n& Spruit 1987; see also Weber & Davis 1967; Kawaler 1988;\nChaboyer et al. 1995a,b). For such a convergence to occur\nat the age of the Hyades, the timescale for coupling the\nstars radiative interior to its outer convective zone must\nalso be significantly shorter than the Hyades age (see, e.g.,\nCollier Cameron et al. 2009).\nThe relationship between age, rotation, and activity has\nbeen a crucial topic of stellar evolution over the past 40\nyears. Angular momentum loss due to stellar winds is generally thought to be responsible for the Skumanich (1972)\nlaw, but the exact dependence of rotational velocity on age\nis not entirely clear, and it relies on the assumed stellar\nmagnetic field geometry and degree of core-envelope coupling (Kawaler 1988; Krishnamurthi et al. 1997). Empirical\nage-rotation relations have been proposed to determine the\nage of stars, a method referred to as gyrochronology (e.g.,\nBarnes 2003, 2007; Mamajek & Hillenbrand 2008; Collier\nCameron et al. 2009; Barnes 2010). Empirical age-activity\nrelations have also been proposed, though these do not always find activity decaying with time quite as simply as\npredicted by the Skumanich law (e.g., Feigelson et al. 2004;\nPace & Pasquini 2004; Giampapa et al. 2006).\nThe determination of stellar rotational periods in large\nsamples of stars of different ages and mass is also crucial\nfor understanding the relationships with stellar properties\nand their close surroundings. It is also expected that the\ndissipation timescale of circumstellar discs is related to the\nprocesses of planets formation (e.g. Bouvier 2008). On the\nother hand, the presence of planets may in turn influence\nthe stellar rotational evolution. Recently, Pont (2009) has\ninvestigated the influence of tidal interaction with close-in\ngiant planets (Hot Jupiters), and Lanza (2010) studied the\nrole of Hot Jupiter interaction with the coronal magnetic\nfield in the stellar angular momentum loss rate via a magnetised wind.\nOpen clusters also represent a unique testbed for studying the Li depletion with age and its relationships with\nstellar rotation (e.g., Sestito & Randich 2005, Jeffries &\nOliveira 2005, Randich et al. 2005). In fact, stellar rotation\nplays a role in shaping the internal circulation, which in\nturn affects the abundance of light elements that are easily\ndestroyed in the stellar interior (Li, Be, B). A survey of Li\nabundances in young stellar associations has been carried\nout by da Silva et al. (2009), who also studied the relationships with age and v sin i.\nWhile significant progress has been attained in the last\nfew years, thanks to several dedicated projects or as a byproduct of high-precision photometric planet-transit surveys, our knowledge of the rotation evolution of late-type\nstars remains incomplete, so firm confirmation of the correlations proposed above is still needed. RACE-OC (Rotation\n\n\fS. Messina et al.: Rotation and variability in young associations\n\nand ACtivity Evolution in Open Clusters) is a long-term\nproject designed to study the evolution of the rotational\nproperties and the magnetic activity of late-type members\nof stellar open clusters with ages between 1 to about 600\nMyr (Messina 2007; Messina et al. 2008, 2010a). In Messina\net al. (2010b, hereafter Paper I), we considered stellar associations at distances closer than 100 pc and ages younger\nthan about 100 Myr from the list of Torres et al. (2008).\nThese are TW Hydrae, \u03b2 Pictoris, Tucana/Horologium,\nColumba, Carina, and AB Doradus associations. They span\nages between 8 and 100 Myr and, therefore, allow us to\nstudy the angular momentum evolution close to the crucial\nphase of dissipation of circumstellar discs and planet formation. In Paper I, we determined rotational periods for\n144 of 204 late-type members of these associations. A clear\nindication of evolution with time of rotational period and of\nits photometric signatures (e.g., photometric amplitude of\nlight curve) has been observed. The goal of the present paper is to complete the study of the associations identified\nby Torres et al. (2008), determining the rotational properties of members of \u01eb Chamaeleontis, Octans, and Argus\nassociations (\u223c6, 20, and 40 Myr, respectively), with mean\ndistances between 110 and 150 pc.\nIn Sect.2, we present the sample considered in the\npresent study. In Sect. 3, we describe the photometric data\nthat are used in our analysis. In Sect. 4, we describe our\nprocedure for the rotation period search. In Sect. 5, we\npresent our results. Conclusions are given in Sect. 6. In the\nAppendix we present the results on periods for a few revisited targets in Paper I.\n\n2. The sample\nThe sample of our investigation is taken from the compilation of Torres et al. (2008), which includes an updated analysis of the membership of nearby associations younger than\n100 Myr. We selected the following associations that have\nmean distances beyond 100 pc: \u01eb Chamaeleontis, Octans,\nand Argus. These associations are reported with ages in\nthe range \u223c6 to \u223c40 Myr (cfr. Table 1).\nThe \u01eb Chamaeleontis association was discovered and\ncharacterised by Frink et al. (1998). We selected 15 latetype members: 14 are high-probability members from the\ncompilation of Torres et al. (2008) and one is a recently\nadded member by Kiss et al. (2011) as part of the RAVE\n(Radial Velocity Experiment) project. Given the possible\nconnection with \u01eb Chamaeleontis, as first suggested by\nMamajek et al. (1999), we also compiled a list of all (15)\nlate-type members of the \u03b7 Chamaeleontis cluster from\nTorres et al. (2008), whose age is estimated as around 4-9\nMyr. Four cluster members with good kinematic data were\nfound as high-probability members of the \u01eb Cha association. In the following analysis we consider both \u03b7 and \u01eb\nCha members as coeval with an age of \u223c 6 Myr, but we\ncontinue to use different symbols to distinguish them.\nThe Octans association was discovered within the\nSACY project (Torres et al. 2003). Owing to its mean distance of about 140 pc and the small number of members\nwith trigonometric parallax, the accuracies on distance of\nindividual members and age (\u223c 20 Myr) are poorer than for\nother associations found with the same approach and the\ndiscovered members mostly have G spectral type. Torres et\nal. (2008) give an updated list of members of this associa-\n\n3\n\ntion from which we selected a sample of 12 members with\nspectral type later than F.\nThe Argus association was also discovered by Torres et\nal. (2003) in the SACY survey. Based on the convergence\nmethod and following the suggestion of Makarov & Urban\n(2000), they found that the kinematic properties of the\nmembers of the IC 2391 open cluster are in good agreement\nwith their proposed Argus members. Torres et al. (2008)\ngive an updated list of members of both Argus and IC 2391\nmembers. Finally, we also considered the new candidates\nmembers of young associations recently identified by Kiss\net al. (2011) from RAVE data and by Desidera et al. (2011).\nFrom these lists, we compiled a sample of 57 members (27\nArgus stars and 30 stars in IC 2391) with spectral type later\nthan F.\nFrom the initial list of 121 known stellar members, we\nselected 99 late-type stars (spectral types later than F or\ncolours consistent with a late spectral type) that are suitable for the photometric search of rotational modulations.\nIn Table 1 we list name, abbreviation, age, and mean distance of the associations under study (Torres et al. 2008),\ntogether with the number of known members and late-type\nmembers selected for period search. Most of the spectroscopic information (spectral types, projected rotational velocity v sin i) is from SACY database (Torres et al. 2006).\nIn the case of IC 2391 cluster, v sin i values come from da\nSilva et al. (2009) and Marsden et al. (2009). Additional\nbibliography for individual targets is given in Appendix A.\nFurthermore, to complete the analysis of the associations studied in Paper I, we considered the photometry\nbecoming available in the Wide Angle Search for Planets\n(SuperWASP) archive for the stars of TW Hydrae, \u03b2\nPictoris, Tucana/Horologium, Columba, Carina and AB\nDoradus associations. The new rotation periods of the associations studied in Paper I and retrieved from SuperWASP\nphotometry are reported in Appendix B.\n\n3. Data\n3.1. The ASAS photometry\nAs in Paper I, most of the present analysis is based on data\nfrom the All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) (Pojmanski\n1997; 2002). The ASAS project is monitoring all stars\nbrighter than V=14 at declinations \u03b4 < +28\u25e6 , with typical sampling of 2 days. The ASAS archive1 ensures longterm monitoring since it contains data from 1997 to date.\nA short-term monitoring might hamper the identification\nof the correct rotational period. Since the configuration of\nactive regions, which is responsible for the light rotational\nmodulation, evolves with time, such a long time-span is\nparticularly suitable for our purposes.\nThe linear scale at focal plane is 16 arcsec/pixel. The\nFWHM of stellar images is 1.3-1.8 pixels. Aperture photometry through five apertures is available in the ASAS\ncatalogue. The choice of the aperture adopted in our analysis was made star by star by selecting the aperture giving\nthe highest photometric precision (i.e., the minimum average magnitude uncertainty).\n1\n\nwww.astrouw.edu.pl/asas/\n\n\f4\n\nS.

The SuperWASP photometry\nThe SuperWASP project (Pollacco et al. 2006) recently released the first public data archive (Butters et al. 2010)\n2\n. Light curves from 2004 to 2008 for both the northern\nand southern observatories are included. Temporal and spatial coverage is irregular, but extended enough to make a\nsystematic search for photometric timeseries of our targets\nmeaningful. The observing procedure includes sequences up\nto nine hours long for stars at the most favourable sky\ndeclinations with a sampling of about ten minutes. The\nSuperWASP data have therefore a better sensitivity to pe2\n\nwww.wasp.le.ac.uk/public/\n\nriods <\n\u223c 1 d than the ASAS data. We then checked the availability in SuperWASP archive of data for both the targets\nstudied in this paper as well those we studied in Paper I.\nTo further complete Paper I analysis, we also checked the\navailability of ASAS and SuperWASP photometry for the\nnew candidates members of young MG identified by Kiss et\nal. (2011). Our analysis is based on the processed flux measurements obtained through application of the SYSREM\nalgorithm (Tamuz et al. 2005). SuperWASP observations\nwere collected in 2004 without any light filter, the spectral transmission defined by the optics, detector, and atmosphere. Starting from 2006 they were collected through\na wide band filter in the 400-700 nm. Owing to differences\n\n\fS.

Messina et al.: Rotation and variability in young associations\n\nFig. 1 Colour-corrected colour-magnitude diagrams with overplotted PMS tracks (solid lines) from Baraffe et al. (1998)\nfor \u01eb and \u03b7 Cha (left) and Octans (right). Different symbols indicate stars belonging to different association/clusters;\nbigger symbols indicate longer rotation periods. Filled symbols represent members with unknown rotation period. Black\nsymbols represent stars whose V\u2212I colour is derived from spectral type.\nuse of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram (Scargle 1982). The\nlight curves of late-type active stars are typically characterised by changes in amplitude and shape with timescales\nof a few months or even shorter (see, e.g., Messina et al.\n2004). These are due to the finite lifetime of active regions,\nconsisting of either dark spots or bright faculae, and to differential rotation. Additional photometric variability is observed on timescales shorter and longer than the rotation\nperiod because of flares and magnetic cycles. This variability pattern causes the application of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram to the whole light curve to fail the detection of\nthe rotational period in some cases. Therefore, in addition\nto analysing the whole timeseries (which is typically 8-yr\nlong for ASAS data and 4-yr long for SuperWASP data),\nwe performed the period search on light-curve segments not\nexceeding two months.\nThe determination of the false alarm probability (FAP)\nis a crucial issue for evaluating the significance of detected\nperiodicities. The existence of significant correlations between data that are collected on shorter timescales than\nthe stellar variability does not allow safely making the assumption that each observed data point is independent of\nthe others (Herbst & Wittenmyer 1996; Stassun et al. 1999;\nRebull 2001; Lamm et al. 2004). To overcome this difficulty,\nwe follow the bootstrap approach proposed by Herbst et\nal. (2002). For each light curve segment, we scramble 1000\ntimes the day numbers of the Julian Day (JD) while keeping\nphotometric magnitudes and the decimal part of the JD unchanged. Then we perform the period search on each fake\nrandomised dataset, comparing the power of the highest\npeak to that observed on the real dataset to obtain the FAP.\nWe adopt a confidence level larger than 99% (FAP< 0.01)\nas detection threshold for a significant detection.\nFinally, to successfully identify the true rotational periodicity, it is necessary to consider aliases, which might have\n\neven higher power than the true period. The spectral window function is inspected to disentangle aliases (1-d peak,\nbeat periods between the star's rotation period (P) and the\ndata sampling). The uncertainties in the period determination were derived following Lamm et al. (2004).\nFor each target we report (Tables 2-4) the detected rotation period, together with the number of segments in which\nsuch a period was derived, with a confidence level higher\nthan 99%. In some cases, however, the same period was\nfound in other segments with a confidence level below 99%,\nbut the lightcurve still showed a clear rotational modulation\nwith this very period. We therefore also report the number\nof segments in which the lightcurve, when phased with the\ndetected rotation period, shows a smooth sinusoidal variation; in this case, the average residual in the sinusoidal\nfit of the light curve is smaller than the light-curve amplitude. The number of segments in which the period was\nfound with a confidence level higher than 99% and/or the\nnumber of segments in which the phased lightcurve show\naverage residuals lower than its amplitude can be used to\nestimate the robustness of the period determination. When\nv sin i measurements are also available, a consistency check\ncan be performed with the equatorial velocity, which can\nbe derived from the rotational period and an estimate of\nthe stellar radius. We use this information to classify the\ndetected periods according to their reliability.\nPeriods derived in at least five segments, or in less than\nfive but with an independent confirmation from the literature, and that are consistent with v sin i will be referred\nto as confirmed periods (C). Periods derived in less than\nfive segments that are consistent with v sin i and that produce mean residuals in the sinusoidal fit less than the lightcurve amplitude in at least five segments will be referred to\nas likely periods (L).

Results\nThe results of our investigation are summarised in Table\n1, where we report the total number of confirmed periodic\nmembers (and the total number of confirmed + likely +\nuncertain in paretheses), the number of periodic members\nwith period adopted from the literature, new periods determined from this study (and periods revised by us with\nrespect to earlier literature values).\nWe determined 45 confirmed rotation periods (31 of\nwhich are new determinations), 11 likely, 24 uncertain (10\nof which are taken from the literature). Eleven of 80 periodic stars were already known from the literature and\nwe could confirm their rotation period, whereas we revised it for 3 stars (RECX 1, RECX 11, and CD-48 2972,\nsee Appendix A). The rotation periods of 19 stars remain\nunknown, for three of which we have data neither in ASAS,\nin SuperWasp, nor in the literature, whereas for 16 we find\nnon-periodic variability. In Tables 2-4 we report the results\nof a period search in some detail for the members of indi-\n\nvidual associations. As in Paper I, the results of the period\nsearch for close spectroscopic binaries whose rotation might\nbe altered by the tides of their companions is here reported.\nHowever, they are excluded from the rotational distributions and also when computing the mean and median values in the subsequent sections. In the online Table B.2, we\nlist the rotation periods for each periodic target, together\nwith uncertainties and normalised powers, determined in\nthe individual time-series segments.\nThe light curves of all stars for which either the ASAS\nor the SuperWASP photometry allowed us to determine the\nrotation period are plotted in the online Figs. ??-??.\n\n5.1. Colour-magnitude diagrams\nFollowing the approach of Paper I, we use the MV vs. V\u2212I\nCMD and a set of low-mass PMS evolutionary tracks to\nderive masses and radii. Owing to the targets distances,\non average larger than 100 pc, and their young ages, especially in the case of the \u01eb / \u03b7 Cha members, the observed\ncolours may suffer from reddening arising either from interstellar or circumstellar material. We have investigated\non the possible colour excess of all targets and derived the\nintrinsic colours for the subsequent analysis. V magnitudes\nare taken from ASAS because the long-term monitoring\ngives the possibility of measuring the brightest magnitude\nover a long time range, i.e. the value corresponding to the\nobserved minimum spot coverage. In most cases, the ASAS\nV-magnitudes are found to be brighter than those reported\nin the references below.\n\u01eb Chamaeleontis. Colours are taken either from Torres\net al. (2006) or Alcal\u00e0 et al. (1995) both in the\nJohnson-Cousins photometric system. All but two members\n(GSC 9235-01702 and CD\u221274712) are found to be affected\nby reddening (see online Tables B.3-B.5). The colour excess\n\n\f8\n\nS.

The V\u2212I colour is used since\nalmost all the \u03b7 Cha members lack B\u2212V measurements. Right panel: same as left panel but for Octans members versus\nB\u2212V.\nof each target is determined by comparing the observed\nV\u2212I colour with the V\u2212I colour corresponding to the spectral type of a standard dwarf star. The AV extinction is\nderived from E(V\u2212I) using the relations of Mathis (1990).\nWe find that the AV extinction ranges from 0.1 to 1.8 mag.\nA study by Knude & Hog (1998) based on the Hipparcos\nand Tycho data found that in the Chamaeleon region the\ninterstellar extinction in the distance range of our targets\nnever exceeds AV \u223c0.15 mag. Therefore, the derived reddening, in agreement with the very young age of the \u01eb Cha\nmembers, likely arises from circumstellar rather than from\ninterstellar material.\n\u03b7 Chamaeleontis. Colours in the Johnson-Cousins photometric system and spectral types in the present paper\nare taken from Lawson et al. (2001; 2002). A study by\nWestin (1985) has found the interstellar reddening for this\ncluster to be unimportant. This result is also confirmed by\nMamajek et al. (2000) who found the V\u2212I colour of members to be consistent with the inferred spectral type.\nOctans. The observed colours are taken from Torres et\nal. (2006) and are found to be consistent with the spectral types; therefore, no reddening correction is applied. We\nadopt the V\u2212I colour corresponding to the target's spectral\ntype for four stars missing V\u2212I measurements. Only one\nstar (TYC 7066 1037 1) with measured V\u2212I colour shows\nan excess that we corrected as described above.\nArgus. V\u2212I colours are taken from Torres et al. (2006).\nWe adopt the colours corresponding to the spectral type of\nstandard dwarf stars for 14 members that lack V\u2212I measurements. Only one star (TYC 8561 0970 1) with measured\nV\u2212I colour shows an excess that we corrected as above.\nIC2391. Colours in the Johnson-Cousins photometric\nsystem are taken either from Patten & Simon (1996) or\nfrom Platais et al. (2007). In the latter case only B\u2212V is\nmeasured and V\u2212I is inferred from spectral type. The mean\nreddening towards IC 2391 is estimated to be close to zero\n\n(Patten & Simon 1996) and no correction was made for interstellar reddening. Only one star (PMM 1759) needed to\nbe corrected to make V\u2212I consistent with spectral type.\nIn general, as expected from variability arising from\nspots and/or faculae, the V-magnitude variability amplitude in our targets never exceeds \u223c0.3 mag. The only deviating star is PMM 8145 whose variability amplitude reaches\n\u223c2 mag. In this case, however, there is a close, very bright\nnearby star (o Vel, V=3.6 mag \u2206\u03b1=2 arcsec, \u2206\u03b4=70 arcsec) and therefore CCD saturation affecting the PMM 8415\ntime-series cannot be ruled out.\nV magnitudes, B\u2212V, and U\u2212B colours (flagged with\nAV when corrected for reddening), absolute magnitudes,\ndistances and v sin i values from the literature are listed in\nthe online Tables B.3-B.5.\nThe reddening-corrected CMDs of the studied associations are plotted in Figs. 1-2 together with the Baraffe et\nal. (1998) evolutionary tracks and the CMDs of three wellstudied open clusters of known age for reference: \u03b1 Persei\n(\u223c70 Myr), the Pleiades (\u223c110 Myr), and NGC 2516 (\u223c150\nMyr).\nAs in Paper I, we estimate masses and radii comparing\npositions in the CMD with the Baraffe et al. (1998) evolutionary tracks. The stellar radius (R) allows us to make\na comparison between v sin i and the equatorial velocity\nveq =2\u03c0 R /P (where P is the rotation period) to check the\nconsistency between the two and derive the stellar inclination. Derived masses and radii are listed in the online\nTables B.3-B.5.\n5.2. v sin i vs. equatorial velocity\nAll but five of the periodic variables in our sample have\nknown projected equatorial velocities (v sin i). In Fig. 3,\nwe compare v sin i and veq , by delineating the loci of\nv sin i=veq , corresponding to equator-on orientation, and\n\n\fS. Messina et al.: Rotation and variability in young associations\n\nFig. 5 The same as Fig. 4, but for Argus / IC 2391 association. The dashed and dotted lines represent mathematical\nfunctions describing the loci of the upper and lower bounds\nof the period distribution of \u03b1 Persei members according to\nBarnes (2003).\n\nv sin i=\u03c0/4 veq , corresponding to a randomly orientated rotation axis distribution. In Fig. 3 all periodic (confirmed,\nlikely, and uncertain) targets are plotted. The major uncertainty in the equatorial velocity is the radius estimate.\nThe reported v sin i uncertainties are on average 10%. Only\nfour stars ( GSC 9419-01065 in \u01eb Cha, CD-582194 and CPD621197 in Argus, and PMM 351 in IC 2391) (flagged with\nan apex c in Tables 2 and 4 and plotted with circled symbols in Fig. 3) have inconsistent v sin i/veq (i.e., much larger\nthan unity). These cases are discussed in Appendix A.\nIn Table 5, for each association we report the average <sini>\u00b1\u03c3, the correlation coefficient r from the linear\nPearson statistics between v sin i and veq , where the labels\na and b indicate the significance level of the correlation coefficient. The significance level represents the probability of\nobserving a value of the correlation coefficient greater than\nr for a random sample with the same number of observations and degrees of freedom.\nIt is interesting to note that all association members have\nmean inclinations that are inconsistent with the value (\u03c0/4)\nexpected for a completely randomly orientated rotational\naxis distribution. Specifically, all association members tend\nto appear almost equator-on to the observer. This behaviour, which was also exhibited by the six other associations within 100 pc analysed in Paper I, may arise from\nsome bias rather than being real. A bias in the member selection is unlikely, since the association members were identified in larger samples selected on the basis of their X-ray\nemission, which is not affected by the inclination of the rotation axis. On the contrary, a bias towards equator-on members may be more likely. In fact, we find that members with\nunknown rotation periods exhibit on average v sin i systematically smaller than members with uncertain, likely, and\nconfirmed periods, respectively. In the specific case of Argus\n\n9\n\n/ IC 2391, which is the most numerous association in the\npresent paper, we find that members with unknown periods\nhave <v sin i>=15.1 km s\u22121 with respect to <v sin i>=33.8\nkm s\u22121 exhibited by members with confirmed periods. In\nthe case of the AB Dor association studied in Paper I we\nfind <v sin i>=8.2 km s\u22121 for stars with unknown period\nagainst <v sin i>=25.9 km s\u22121 for members with confirmed\nperiods. From the former case, we can infer that about 20%\nof stars, whose average v sin i is about half that of equatoron stars, is still missing in the v sin i versus veq plot of Argus\n/ IC 2391. Therefore, a bias towards stars with high values\nof inclination is present, which are those that show largeramplitude light modulation and that are most favoured\nfor the rotation period determination. We may also suppose that our derived radii are all systematically underestimated, likely from effects of high magnetic activity and\nfast rotation, as found by, e.g., Chabrier et al. (2007) and\nMorales et al. (2009). This makes veq systematically small\nwith respect to the measured v sin i. Nonetheless, these two\nquantities are found to be strongly correlated (see Table 5)\ndifferently than expected in the case of random distribution\nof axes. This finding certainly deserves further investigation\nto take all possible observation biases into account so is beyond the scope of the present paper.\n5.3. \u01eb / \u03b7 Chamaeleontis\nWe determined the rotation periods for 11 stars in \u01eb Cha, of\nwhich there are ten new and one already known in the literature. The rotation periods of another two stars were retrieved from the literature. For stars in \u03b7 Cha, we retrieved\n12 rotation periods, of which seven were retrieved from the\nliterature. For \u01eb and \u03b7 Cha we therefore have a total of 25\nperiods available, 14 confirmed, 1 likely, and 10 uncertain.\nIn the left panel of Fig. 4, we plot with filled blue bullets\nand red squares the members of \u01eb and \u03b7 Cha, respectively,\nwith confirmed periods. Small-size filled symbols represent\nlikely periods, whereas small-size open symbols are used for\nuncertain periods.\nMembers of \u01eb Cha with confirmed periods have all M\n\u2265 0.8M\u2299 . Their periods have a mean Pmean = 4.35d and\na median Pmedian = 3.97d. Members of \u03b7 Cha with confirmed periods have all but one M\u22650.8M\u2299 . Their periods\nhave Pmean = 4.67d and Pmedian = 4.84d, although only\nderived from four stars. If \u01eb and \u03b7 Cha are considered together as a coeval system, we obtain Pmean = Pmedian =\n4.45d.\n5.4. Octans\nOf 12 late-type members to the Octans association, we determine the rotation periods of ten stars (eight of which are\nconfirmed periods, and two are likely periods). The Octans\nrotation period distribution is plotted in the right panel\nof Fig. 4. Owing to the very small number of known latetype members, the period distribution upper bound is not\nsufficiently defined. All confirmed periodic members in our\nstudy have masses M \u2265 0.8M\u2299 and the mean and median\nperiods turned out to be Pmean = 1.46d and Pmedian =\n1.61d.\nOctans is the most distant association (\u223c140 pc) and,\nowing to the small number of members with accurate\ntrigonometric parallax, its age is the most uncertain in our\n\n\f10\n\nS. Messina et al.: Rotation and variability in young associations\n\nsample. As for the other associations, the Octans members\nwere selected by SACY on the basis of their X-ray emission in the ROSAT Bright Survey. However, the detected\nmembers of Octans are at the detection limit of that survey. Therefore, it is likely that only the most active and,\ntherefore, fast rotating members have been detected. That\nmeans that our sample of periodic stars is biased, the detection of only the fastest rotating stars being favoured.\nTherefore, the bias towards the faster rotators, together\nwith the uncertainty on age, makes the Octans mean and\nmedian rotational periods quite unreliable, which must be\ntaken into account in our analysis of the rotation period\nevolution reported in Fig. 7.\n5.5. Argus / IC 2391\nAmong the three associations under analysis, Argus has the\nlargest number of late-type members, 27 Argus stars plus\n30 additional stars in the IC 2391 cluster. We determine the\nrotation period of 45 members. However, only for 23 members, which are plotted in Fig. 5, are the rotation periods\nconfirmed.\nWe overplot the empirically determined functions computed according to Barnes (2003) and describing the loci of\nthe upper/lower bounds of the \u03b1 Persei period distribution\nfor main-sequence stars. The Argus/IC 2391 upper bound is\nvery close to the dashed line, which is computed for a nominal age of 70 Myr, suggesting an age for Argus/IC 2391,\nslightly older than the quoted age of 40 Myr. Considering\nconfirmed periods only, we found Pmean = Pmedian = 2.27d\nfor Argus, Pmean = 2.36d, and Pmedian = 3.03d for IC 2391.\nIn both cases all stars have mass M > 0.8M\u2299 . When all\nmembers (Argus/IC 2391) are considered, together Pmean =\n2.43 and Pmedian = 2.30d. Although quoted with the same\nage, we see, either in Fig. 5 or from the above mean values,\nthat the distribution of rotation periods of IC 2391 stars appears slightly different from that of Argus stars, with more\nslow rotators in the cluster. This difference may arise from\nthe different selection criteria adopted to search for members. Argus members are identified on the basis of their\nX-ray emission and are all present in the ROSAT Bright\nSource Catalog (Voges et al. 1999). Conversely, the IC 2391\nmembers are selected from a variety of sources, without\nX-ray preselection. Since fast rotators have brighter coronal luminosities and the mean distance of Argus asociation\nmembers is 106 pc, compared to \u223c145 pc for IC 2391, we\nexpect that the census of association members is biased toward the most active and fast-rotating stars (see Desidera\net al. 2011).\n5.6. Rotation-photospheric activity connection\nFollowing Paper I, we have extracted for each confirmed\nperiodic target the V-band maximum peak-to-peak light\ncurve amplitude ever observed in the available time series\nthat are plotted in Fig. 6. For the older associations under analysis, Octans and Argus/IC 2391, the photometric\nvariability mostly arises from the presence of cool spots\non the stellar photosphere. In the case of \u01eb/\u03b7 Cha, a contribution from hot spots, arising from accretion processes,\ncannot be ruled out. The largest amplitudes are observed\nin the youngest association at an age of about 6 Myr where\nthe presence of circumstellar material (as inferred from the\n\nobserved colour excess) and related accretion phenomena\nare still expected. The lowest amplitudes are observed in\nthe Octans association with an assumed age of about 20\nMyr. The apparent age dependence of the light curve amplitude at fixed rotation and mass will be discussed in a\nforthcoming paper (Messina et al., in preparation).\n5.7. Rotation period evolution\nIn Fig. 7, we plot the results of our period search in the\nnine associations under study, where we show the rotation\nperiod variation of low-mass stars versus age in the 0.8-1.2\nM\u2299 range. We plot the rotation periods listed in Tables\n2-4 of this paper, and in Tables 3-8 of Paper I, complemented with the updated values listed in Table B.1 of this\npaper. We overplot the median and mean rotation periods computed for each association (or coeval associations\nas explained by the labels) considering only the confirmed\nrotation periods to which we assign the same weight. We\nalso add the mean and median rotation periods of ONC\n(Herbst et al. 2002), NGC 2264 (Rebull et al. 2002; Lamm\net al. 2004), \u03b1 Persei, and the Pleiades, whose rotation periods are taken from the compilation of Messina et al. (2003,\nand references therein).\nIn Table 6 we report for each cluster/association the\nnumber of confirmed periods used to derive the mean and\nmedian values, as well as the KS significance levels that\nconsecutive (at increasing ages) measured period distributions are drawn from the same distribution according to\nKolmogorov-Smirnov tests (see, e.g., sect. 14.3 of Press et\nal. (1992). Period distribution variations that are not statistically significant have KS values close to unity, while\nstatistically significant variations have KS values close to\nzero.\nThe newly added mean and median values at 6 Myr (\u01eb/\u03b7\nCha) and 40 Myr (Argus/IC 2391) confirm the trend of period evolution with age found in Paper I. From 1 to 9 Myr,\nthe mean and median periods slowly decrease, but the KS\nvalues remain rather high, which indicate that indeed the\nperiod distributions do not change significantly. This behaviour is consistent with a locking mechanism operating\nin this age range. From 9 to 30 Myr both mean and median\nperiods decrease and the KS values indicate a statistical\nsignificant variation in this case. The decrease in mean and\nmedian periods is monotonic, with only the period distribution of Octans deviating from this trend. However, as discussed in Sect. 5.4, the sample of known Octans late-type\ncomponents is expected to be rather incomplete and biased\ntowards fast rotators, which could explain the rather low\nmean and median periods compared with adjacent values.\nFurthermore, the Octans age uncertainty is considerably\nlarger than for the other associations. For the 0.8 - 1.2 M\u2299\nrange, our analysis is therefore consistent with a considerable disc-locking before 9 Myr, followed by a moderate but\nunambiguous spin-up from 9 to 30 Myr, consistent with\nstellar contraction towards the ZAMS.\nVariations between 30 and 70 Myr are rather doubtful.\nThe KS test indicates that there is no significant variation\nbetween 30 and 40 Myr. On the other hand, the KS test\nindicates a significant variation between 40 and 70 Myr, but\nwhile the median indicates a significant spin-up, the mean\nremains approximately constant. Between 70 and 110 Myr\nthe KS test indicates a significant variation and both mean\nand median periods increase. This situation may be due to\n\n\fS. Messina et al.: Rotation and variability in young associations\n\n11\n\nFig. 6 Distribution of V-band peak-to-peak light curve amplitudes versus rotation period for the members of \u01eb/\u03b7 Cha\n(left panel), Octans (middle panel), and Argus/IC 2391 (right panel.)\nthe heterogeneity of the sample: all stars with masses above\n1 M\u2299 are expected to complete their contraction toward the\nZAMS at ages earlier than about 30 Myr, but stars with\nlower mass will end the contraction towards the ZAMS later\non (around 70 Myr for a star of 0.8 M\u2299 ). The unambiguous\nspin-down from 70 to 110 Myr is consistent with all stars\nin the 0.8 - 1.2 M\u2299 mass range having entered the MS\nphase and therefore the angular momentum evolution being\ndominated by wind-braking.\n\n6. Conclusions\nWe have performed a rotation period search for all latetype members of the nine young (<100 Myr) associations\nknown to date for which either ASAS or SuperWASP data\nare available. We supplemented such information with rotation periods retrieved from the literature to derive a catalogue that contains (considering also the new periods listed\nin Table B.1) a total of 241 rotation periods. We have established quality criteria for classifying the derived period\nbased on the frequency of period determination in various\nlight-curve segments, independent measurements retrieved\nfrom the literature, and consistency with v sin i. Based on\nsuch criteria, three quality levels are proposed: confirmed,\nlikely, and uncertain. Our catalogue contains 171 confirmed,\n44 likely, and 26 uncertain periods. The rotation period remains unknown for the remaining 50 late-type members.\nThanks to the newly determined period distributions at\n\u223c6, \u223c30, and \u223c40 Myr, our catalogue allows a better empirical description of angular momentum evolution of stars\nwith masses from 0.8 to 1.2 M\u2299 and with ages from 1 to\n100 Myr.\nThe catalogue is used to build rotation period distributions vs. colours for each association in the 0.8-1.0 M\u2299 mass\nrange. Excluding Octans, which is likely to be affected by\na strong selection bias toward shorter periods, the average\nand median periods are found to essentially decrease from\nthe ONC age (\u223c1 Myr) untill the \u03b1 Persei age (\u223c70 Myr).\nThe two-sided KS test indicates that indeed the period distributions do not change much from 1 to 9 Myr, while variations are statistically significant from 9 to 30 Myr. This\nincrease in the average rotation rate with age is consistent\n\nFig. 7 Rotation period evolution versus time in the 0.8-1.2\nsolar mass range. Small dots represent individual rotation\nperiod measurements. Bullets connected by solid lines are\nmedian periods, whereas asterisks connected by dotted lines\nare mean periods. Short horizontal lines represent the 25th\nand 75th percentiles of rotation period. This plot updates\nthe right panel of Fig. 12 of Paper I.\n\nwith the contraction of the stars toward the ZAMS, which is\ncontrasted by disc-locking at an early stage. The situation\nfrom 30 to 70 Myr is rather uncertain, probably because\nof the heterogeneity of our sample, in which stars of different mass reach the ZAMS at different ages. From \u03b1 Per\n(70 Myr) to the AB Dor/Pleiades (110 Myr) both mean\nand median periods increase with the KS test, indicating a\nstatistically significant variation.\n\n\f12\n\nS.

Although the flux rotational modulation is clearly found in more than five segments; however,\nthe computed veq =2\u03c0R/P is inconsistent with the measured v sin i=18.0 km s\u22121 (Torres et al. 2006), so this period is considered uncertain. However, we note that the only\navailable v sin i measurement has quite a large \u00b130% uncertainty. More accurate determinations would be desiderable\nto confirm the correctness of the current v sin i value.\nHD 104237E: the ASAS photometry did not allowed\nus to infer any periodicity. We adopted the period of\nP=2.45d detected by Feigelson et al. (2003), which combined with the estimated radius gives an equatorial velocity\nconsistent with the measured v sin i. This star belongs to\na quintuple system, where the brightest component is the\nHerbig Ae star HD 104237. Feigelson et al. (2003) found\na reddening AV =1.8\u00b10.3 that likely arises from material\nwithin the parent stellar system, the reddening of other\nmembers associated to \u01eb Cha being small or even absent.\nGSC 9416-1029: Doppmann et al. (2007) report a period of P=5.35d that likely represents the system's orbital\n\n13\n\nperiod. The available ASAS photometry of this star, which\nis quite inaccurate owing to the target's faintness, shows evidence of a period P=5.50d in two of nine time segments. In\nthe case this is the correct rotational period, which would\nimply a rotational/orbital synchronisation, which is quite a\nsurprising circumstance at an age of about 6 Myr.\nGSC 9235-01702: it has very recently been discovered\nto be a member of \u01eb Cha by Kiss et al. (2011) as part of the\nRAVE project. From the ASAS photometry, we found the\nsame rotation period as found by Bernhard et al. (2009),\nbased on the same ASAS data.\nRECX 1 (EG Cha): we detect a rotation period\nP=4.5d in 12 of 15 time segments, which is twice the period\nreported by Lawson et al. (2001). An inspection of Fig. 2 of\nLawson et al. (2001) shows that their phased light curves in\nboth 1999 and 2000 seasons exhibit significant magnitude\nphase dispersion.\nRECX 11 (EP Cha): we found a period P=4.84d in\n7 of 12 time segments with confidence level over 99% and\nno evidence of any power peak at the period P=3.95d discovered by Lawson et al. (2001) in 1999 (P=3.69d in 2000).\nAgain, an inspection of their phased light curves shows significant dispersion\nRECX 12 (EQ Cha): the star shows two significant\nperiods in Lawson et al. (2001), P=1.25d and P=8.55d. The\nstar is a close binary, so they might represent the rotational\nperiods of the two components. Our analysis allowed us to\ndetect only the shorter period that is adopted in the present\nanalysis.\nRECX 15 (ET Cha): is a classical T Tauri star, with\nevidence of on going accretion (Lawson et al. 2002). The\nlarge amplitude variations (up to 0.44 mag) are likely driven\nby accretion hot spots.\nA.2. Octans\nCD-58 860: we find two periods, P=1.612d and\nP=2.610d, in eight out of ten time segments with comparable levels of confidence. However, the longer period, once\ncombined with stellar radius, determines a ratio v sin i/veq\nslightly greater than unity. Therefore, in the present analysis we adopt P=1.612d.\nCD-43 1451: this star is also present in the\nSuperWASP archive. However, neither from the ASAS nor\nfrom the SuperWASP database we could determine the rotation period, but only the presence of light variability.\nHD 274576: the period P=2.22d is found in nine out\nof ten time segments of ASAS photometry and in two\nout of two SuperWASP observation seasons, and it is\nfully consistent with the measured v sin i. We note that in\nboth the ASAS and SuperWASP timeseries another period\nP=1.824d is also found with a very high confidence level,\nalthough it is smaller than the earlier, in almost all time\nsegments, which is also consistent with v sin i.\nTYC 7066 1037 1: the period P=2.47d is found in 6\nout of 14 time segments of ASAS photometry and in three\nout of five segments of SuperWASP photometry.\n\nA.3. Argus and IC 2391\nHD 5578 (BW Phe): is a close visual binary. We\nfound two rotation periods of comparable power, P=1.461d\n\n\f14\n\nS. Messina et al.: Rotation and variability in young associations\n\nand P=3.15d, in most time segments. The shorter period\nis assumed to be the star's rotation period, since it is the\nonly one consistent with a v sin i/veq\u22641.\nCD-56 1438: we detect a period P=0.24d in only one\nsegment that may conciliate with the very high v sin i.\nCD-28 3434: the P=3.82d period is very well established and also detected in three out of three time segments\nof SuperWASP data, as well in the complete timeseries.\nAlthough no v sin i is available to check consistency with\nveq , it is considered a confirmed period.\nHD 61005: has been suggested to be a likely member\nof the Argus association (Desidera et al. 2011). Although\nits P=5.04d period is found in only three time segments\nof the ASAS timeseries, it was confirmed by the period\nsearch carried out in the Tycho and Hipparcos photometry\n(Desidera et al. 2011), so it is considered confirmed in the\npresent analysis.\nCD-39 5883: the period is detected in two out of nine\nsegments of ASAS photometry and in five out of five segments of WASP data as well in the complete timeseries and\nis consistent with v sin i/veq \u22641.\nCD-58 2194: the most significant period is P=5.16 detected in four time segments as well in the complete timeseries. However, it is inconsistent with the high v sin i. It\nmay be the beat of the P=0.55d period detected in only\none season. This period is therefore considered uncertain.\nCD-57 2315: it is variable, but no periodicity was\nfound.\nCPD-62 1197: the most significant period is P=1.26d\nwhich is found in seven out of nine segments. However, it\nleads to a v sin i/veq\u223c2 and therefore it will not be considered in the following analysis. Another significant period is\nP=0.82d, which is, however only detected in three out of\nnine segments, so it is classified as uncertain.\nTYC 7695 0335 1: the same P=0.39d is found in three\nout of nine ASAS segments and in four out of four segments\nof SuperWASP data.\nHD85151A: is a close visual binary. The P=0.97d is\nonly found in the ASAS complete timeseries, but in five out\nof five time segments of SuperWASP data.\nCD-65 817: is a close visual binary.\nHD 310316: is a close visual binary.\nCD-74 673: is a spectroscopic binary with an orbital\nperiod P=614d (Guenther et al. 2007).\nCD-52 9381: the most significant period is P=5.19d\ndetected in six out of nine time segments, as well in the\ncomplete series. However, a P=0.89d is also detected and\nreported in the ACVS. The shorter one is consistent with\nv sin i/veq\u22641, and it is considered as a confirmed period.\nPPM 351: the most significant period is P=1.931d that\nis found in six out of nine segments; however, it gives\nv sin i/veq>1. Another detected period is P=0.69d, which\nis, however, found in only three out of nine segments, so it\nis considered uncertain.\nPMM 1083 (V365 Vel): our period determination is\nin good agreement with the earlier determination by Patten\n& Simon (1996). Two different v sin i values are reported in\nthe literature, v sin i=43 kms\u22121 from Marsden et al. (2009)\nand v sin i=67 kms\u22121 from Platais et al. (2007). However,\nonly the first is consistent with v sin i/veq\u22641.\nPMM 1820 (V366 Vel): our period determination is\nin good agreement with the earlier determination by Patten\n& Simon (1996).\n\nPMM 4413: is an SB2 with an orbital period P=90.6d\n(Platais et al. 2007) whose components have measured\nv sin i of 8.6 and 8.4 kms\u22121 , which give consistent v sin i/veq\nratios.\nPMM 4467 (V364 Vel); PMM 4902; PMM 5884\n(V377 Vel): our period determinations are in good agreement with the earlier determinations by Patten & Simon\n(1996).\nPPM 8145: unlike stars whose variability arises from\ndark spots, this star spends most of its time in its fainter\nstate. The variability likely arises from magnitude outbursts. It shows the largest variability amplitude (\u223c 2 mag)\nin our sample. The reference magnitude, differently than\nother stars, is probably the faintest one.\nPMM 4902 (V379 Vel): although detected in only\nthree time segments, it is considered confirmed because its\nperiod is confirmed by the literature value (Patten & Simon\n1996).\nPPM 2182: we found two significant periods, P=3.28d\nand P=1.437d. However, both are not consistent with\nv sin i/veq\u22641, being v sin i=78 kms\u22121 (da Silva et al. 2009)\nand therefore are considered uncertain.\n\nAppendix B: New/revised periodicities in young\nassociations studied in Paper I\nThe availability of SuperWASP light curves allowed us to\nrevisit some of the targets studied in Paper I. We found\nSuperWASP timeseries for 71 targets listed in Paper I. For\nthe seven candidate members of \u03b2 Pic and Tuc/Hor newly\nproposed by Kiss et al. (2011), we retrieved SuperWASP\ntimeseries for two of them and ASAS time series for the\nremaining five. Unfortunately, of 78 targets the data on\nnine stars turned out to be too sparse to be suitable for a\nmeaningful period search. The analysis of the 69 timeseries\nallowed us to discover (i) 15 new periods (5 of which likely),\n(ii) to confirm 35 periods, and (iii) to revise 13 periods.\nFinally, for six stars we could not detect any period. Three\nof them were also found non periodic in Paper I, two were\nfound periodic in only 1 or 2 ASAS time segments, and\none had only one literature determination. Our results are\nsummarised in Table B.1.\nConcerning the revised periods, the previous determinations reported in Paper I were either based on literature\nvalues (1 target), had inconsistent v sin i/veq ratio (4 targets), or were beat periods detected in less than five time\nsegments (5 targets), or detected in five or more segments\n(3 targets). Based on this result for the period revision of\na few targets in Paper I, in the present work we decided to\nconsider a rotation period to be well established (confirmed)\nif detected in five or more time segments or in fewer, but\nwith an independent determination from the literature.\nIn the following we update the results presented in\nPaper I including new results based on Super WASP and\non a more conservative period selection.\nTW Hydrae\nWe found SuperWASP data for eight targets in TW Hya\nand confirmed the rotation periods of four targets, and\ndetermined three new periods. However, only one out of\nthe three newly periodic targets (TWA 20) is a confirmed\nTWA member, the other two having been rejected or\nneeding to be confirmed. The rotation period of TWA 23,\n\n\fS. Messina et al.: Rotation and variability in young associations\n\nalthough detected in three out of five time segments, has a\ncritical value close to the data 1-day observation sampling.\nTherefore, even if reported in this work, it needs additional\nobservations to be confirmed, therefore, we classify it as\nuncertain.The data of TWA 3 were quite sparse to be\nsuitable for a period search.\nTo summarise, we have so far derived confirmed\nperiods for 15 out of 17 certain late-type members of TW\nHya. Rotation periods of TWA 3A and TWA 3B are still\nunknown.\n\u03b2 Pictoris\nData for 13 \u03b2 Pic targets are available in the SuperWASP\ndatabase, five of which have been recently identified as \u03b2\nPic members by Kiss et al. (2011). For seven targets we\nconfirm the period determined in Paper I. For the other\nsix we determined previously unknown period, five of them\nclassified as confirmed, the other one (J01071194-1935359)\nas likely.\nTo summarise, we derived confirmed periods for 29 of\nthe 37 late-type members of \u03b2 Pic. For a further three\nstars we determined likely periods, whereas for only one\nstar we have an uncertain period. The rotation periods of\nfour stars still remain unknown.\nTucana/Horologium\nData for 19 Tucana/Horologium targets are available in\nthe SuperWASP database, two of which have been recently\nidentified as Tucana/Horologium members by Kiss et\nal. (2011). For nine targets we confirm the rotation periods\ndetermined in Paper I. For one target (J01521830-5950168)\nwe determined the previously unknown period that we\nclassify as uncertain.We revised the period of HIP 21632,\nwhich was taken from the literature in Paper I and based on\nHipparcos photometry, and the period of TYC 8852 0264 1\nwhose earlier determination led to inconsistent v sin i/veq\nratio. This star was excluded in Paper I from rotation\nperiod evolution analysis also because it is a rejected\nmember. SuperWASP data of six targets were quite sparse\nand unsuited for period search. Data of HD 25402 were\nsuited but did not allow any period detection.\nTo summarise, we derived confirmed periods for 22\nof 29 late-type members of Tucana/Horologium. Two\nstars have rotation periods still to be confirmed. Rotation\nperiods of five stars HIP 490 HIP 6856, TYC 8489 1155 1,\nAF Hor, and HIP 16853 are still unknown.\nColumba\nData for 12 Columba targets are available in the\nSuperWASP database. For four targets we confirm the\nrotation period determined in Paper I. For two targets we\ndetermined the previously unknown period that we classify\nas confirmed. We revised five rotation periods. The revised\nperiod of TYC 7100 2112 1 now gives consistent v sin i/veq\nratio. The other four revised periods were in Paper I either\nbeat periods or detected in four or fewer time segments,\nwhereas they are now well established. Data of HIP 25709\nwere too sparse to allow a period determination.\nTo summarise, we derived confirmed periods for 20 of\n23 late-type members of Columba. TYC 6457 2731 1 and\nTYC 5346 132 1 still have unknown periods. The period of\nHIP 25709 is classified as likely.\nCarina\nWe did not find any SuperWASP data for the Carina\nlate-type members. We derived confirmed periods for 14 of\n21 late-type members. Four stars have the period classified\nas likely. The periods of TYC 8584 2682 1, HD107722 is still\n\n15\n\nunknown. TYC 8586 2431 1 has period leading inconsistent\nv sin i/veq ratio.\nAB Doradus\nData for 26 AB Doradus targets are available in the\nSuperWASP database, and for three targets we determined the previously unknown period (one classified as\nconfirmed, and two as likely ). For 11 targets we confirm\nthe rotation period determined in Paper I. We revised\nsix periods, and did not detect any periodicity of five\nstars although the timeseries are suitable for the period\nsearch. The observations of one target are too sparse for\nperiod search. The rotation period of HIP 116910 reported\nin Paper I revealed itself to be the beat period of the\nconfirmedP=1.787d discovered in SuperWASP data. The\nperiods of TYC 7059 1111 1 and TYC 7598 1488 1 reported\nin Paper I led to inconsistent v sin i/veq ratio, whereas the\nupdated period solved the inconsistency. The period of\nTYC 7064 0839 1, TYC 7605 1429 1, and TYC 7627 2190 1\nreported in Paper I were detected in less than five time\nsegments, whereas the new periods are classified as confirmed.\nTo summarise, we derived confirmed periods of 29 of\n64 late-type members of AB Doradus. Twenty members\nhave periods classified as likely. The rotation period of 15\nmembers is still unknown.\nIn Figs. B.1-B.3 we plot the updated rotation period\ndistributions in the young associations studied in Paper I,\nwhere the newly discovered and the revised rotation periods are plotted with squared and squared crossed symbols,\nrespectively, whereas circled symbols represent the rotation\nperiods of the new candidate members proposed by Kiss et\nal. (2011).\nSimilarly, in Fig. 6 we plot the updated distributions of\nlight curve amplitudes versus rotation period in the young\nassociations studied in Paper I.\nWe notice that both rotation periods and light curve\namplitudes of the newly proposed members by Kiss et\nal. (2011) agreet with the values of the other confirmed association members. This evidence gives further support to\ntheir assigned membership.\n\n\f16\n\nS.
