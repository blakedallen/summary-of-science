Coupled-channels descriptions were shown\nto explain the phenomenon successfully [6, 7]. Recently,\nevidence was found for a strong hindrance of the fusion process at extreme sub-barrier energies, an effect\nfor which there is no satisfactory explanation in present\nmodel calculations [8]. A systematic survey of existing\ndata from the literature shows that there is a regular\npattern to the energy dependence for the appearance of\nfusion hindrance [9]. For stiff, closed-shell colliding systems, a significant maximum in the S-factor is present\nas a function of the beam energy. This maximum signals\nthe onset of sub-barrier hindrance, and the energy, Es , at\nwhich it is located can be described well by an empirical\nformula [9]:\n\u221a 2\nEsref = 0.356 (Z1 Z2 \u03bc) 3 (MeV),\n(1)\nwhere \u03bc = A1 A2 /(A1 + A2 ). For softer systems, this\nformula provides an upper limit for the energy at which\nthe S-factor has its maximum.\nFusion hindrance at extreme sub-barrier energies is relevant, not only for understanding the dynamics of reactions between complex systems, but also for astrophysics\nand for the synthesis of superheavy elements.\n\n\u2217 Deceased\n\nThe influence of nuclear structure on this hindrance\nbehavior was first studied in a detailed comparison [10]\nfor the colliding systems: 58 Ni + 58 Ni [11], 58 Ni + 60 Ni\n[12], 58 Ni + 64 Ni [13], and 64 Ni + 64 Ni [10], where the\nsystems are arranged in order of decreasing stiffness. For\n64\nNi + 64 Ni, an open-shell colliding system, the measured\nlocation in energy of the S-factor maximum is about 9%\nlower than the value expected from Eq. 1 [10], while the\nother systems are more in line with the systematics.\nThe aim of the present paper is to further investigate\nthe hindrance phenomenon by measuring fusion evaporation for the open-shell system 64 Ni + 100 Mo. Compared\nto 64 Ni, 100 Mo is a transitional nucleus with two protons\noutside the closed proton shell. Two earlier measurements of fusion excitation functions for 64 Ni + 100 Mo\ncan be found in the literature [15, 16]. The minimum\ncross section measured in these two experiments is about\n0.4 mb. Since the hindrance behavior is expected (from\nEq. 1) to occur at much lower energies, the main aim of\nthe present measurement was an extension of the excitation function into the nb region in order to localize and\nquantify this hindrance.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE AND\nRESULTS\n\nThe experiment was performed with 64 Ni beams in the\nenergy range of 196-262 MeV from the superconducting\nlinear accelerator ATLAS at Argonne National Laboratory. The maximum beam current used was \u223c 60 pnA.\nThe high melting point of the target material, metal-\n\n\f2\nlic molybdenum evaporated on a 40\u03bcg/cm2 carbon foil,\nprevented damage to the target by the relatively high\nbeam current. The target thickness was constant during\nthe experiment, as monitored with Si detectors. Thin\ntargets with thicknesses of 8 or 18\u03bcg/cm2 were used\nin order to reduce the correction for target thickness\nin the energy regime of steep fall-off of the excitation\nfunction. The isotopic abundance of 100 Mo was 97.42%,\nwith the remainder coming from 98 Mo (0.96%), 97 Mo\n(0.28%), 96 Mo (0.34%), 95 Mo (0.29%), 94 Mo (0.18%),\nand 92 Mo (0.53%). The selection of the beam and target\ncombination excluded the possibility of background from\nfusion reactions coming from beam or target contaminants [8, 9]. Two surface-barrier Si detectors, located at\n\u00b1 43\u25e6 with respect to the beam direction, served as monitors. The absolute cross sections for fusion-evaporation\nwere determined by using elastic scattering measured\nwith the monitors.\nThe evaporation residues were identified and measured\nwith the Fragment Mass Analyzer (FMA) [17], which has\nbeen upgraded with the installation of a split-anode in\nthe first electric-dipole [18]. The background, originating\nmostly from scattered beam, was greatly suppressed after this upgrade. In order to push the cross section measurements to the lowest level, a new focal-plane detector\nwith the configuration PGAC-TIC-PGAC-TIC-PGACIC, was used in the experiment. Here, the symbols PGAC\nstand for x-y position sensitive parallel grid avalanche\ncounters [19], TIC for transmission ionization chambers\n[20], and IC for a large volume multi-anode ionization\nchamber. The first PGAC was mounted at the horizontal (x-direction) focal-plane of the FMA.\nThe y-focus condition occurs about 70 cm downstream\nof the focal-plane, which is nearly at the middle of the\nlast ionization chamber. The three sets of position signals x1 , y1 , x2 , y2 , x3 and y3 were measured with the\nthree PGAC's. The flight-times t2 and t3 obtained from\nPGAC1 -PGAC2 and PGAC1 -PGAC3 were also recorded.\nSeven \u2206E signals were measured with the ionization\nchambers (the first four \u2206E1 -\u2206E4 in the two transmission ionization chambers and the last three \u2206E5 -\u2206E7 in\nthe final ionization chamber, IC). Another time-of-flight\nsignal, trf , measured the time difference between the rfsystem of the accelerator and the first PGAC. Three additional \u2206E signals from the PGAC's were also recorded.\nThe three PGAC's and two TIC's operated at a fixed\npressure of 3 torr of isobutane. The last ionization chamber had an adjustable pressure of 22 - 30 torr of isobutane. There was one 0.13 mg/cm2 Mylar pressure foil in\nfront of the first PGAC, and another one with a thickness\nof 0.22 mg/cm2 located between the third PGAC and the\nlast ionization chamber. This setup allowed for full tracking of each particle detected in the system, and provided\nvery good separation between evaporation residues and\nbackground events. A more detailed description of the\nnew detector system will be published elsewhere [21].\nFor most settings of the FMA, two charge states of the\nresidues were collected simultaneously. For the energies\n\nFIG. 1: Two-dimensional plots of \u2206E6 vs. t3 for the new\nfocal plane detector system at the FMA, obtained at subbarrier incident energies of 198.8 MeV (a) and 196.0 MeV\n(b). The isolated group in (a) (open circles) originates from\nevaporation residues, whereas the other events are caused by\nbackground. At E=196.0 MeV (b), 23 events (open circles)\nfall inside the acceptance window for fusion-evaporation.\n\nElab = 260.5, 245.8, 209.1, 207.1 and 202.2 MeV, full\ncharge state distributions were measured, while for most\nother energies, two FMA settings, i.e. four charge states\nwere recorded. At the four lowest energies, only two\ncharge states were measured. From the full charge state\ndistributions, charge state fractions were determined for\nextrapolation to all other energies. The energy distributions and angular distributions of evaporation residues\nwere calculated with the statistical code PACE [22]. Total angular distributions for fusion-evaporation have been\nmeasured in Ref. [15] for 64 Ni + 100 Mo. In order to\ncheck the PACE code, calculations were compared with\nthese experimental angular distributions of Ref. [15] and\ngood agreement was found as long as the total calculated angular distributions were taken as a weighted sum\nof the angular distributions of the different masses from\nour m/q measurements and folded with multiple scattering. Whereas in Ref. [15] rather thick targets were\nused, the corrections from multiple scattering are small\nin the present experiment. The transport efficiencies of\n\n\f3\nthe FMA were calculated with these angular distributions\ntogether with Monte Carlo simulations, using a modified\nversion of the GIOS Code [23]. The large momentum\nacceptance, \u00b1 10 %, and the large angular acceptance,\n\u03b8lab < 2.3\u25e6 , of the FMA result in a high detection efficiency for the residues.\n\nFIG. 2: Two-dimensional plots of \u2206E5 vs. t3 for the focal\nplane detector system at the FMA, obtained at sub-barrier\nincident energies of 198.8 MeV (a) and 196.0 MeV (b). The\nisolated group in (a) (open circles) originates from evaporation residues. The other events are caused by background.\nAt 196.0 MeV, only one of the candidate evaporation residue\nevents falls within the \u2206E5 range. See text for details.\n\nThe flight-time t3 between PGAC1 and PGAC3 , together with a \u2206E signal measured in a counter far behind\nthe focal plane (e.g. \u2206E6 ), was found to give the best\nseparation of the residues from background events. Twodimensional plots of \u2206E6 vs. t3 are shown in Fig. 1,\nindicating the excellent separation achieved with these\ntwo quantities. Down to a cross section level of \u223c 300\nnb, the evaporation residues could be identified on the\nbasis of these two parameters alone. The events that fall\nwithin the expected window for evaporation residues are\nshown as open circles in Fig. 1a. Events shown by small\npoints originate from beam particles, scattered from the\nbeam pipe or from the area of the \"beam stop\" at the\nfirst split anode. The events in Fig. 1a correspond to\n\na cross section of 242 nb obtained in a 12 hours run. A\ntwo-dimensional plot of \u2206E5 vs. t3 , corresponding to the\nsame events is shown in Fig. 2a. At this energy evaporation residues (open circles) are again well separated from\nbackground events (small points).\nAt the lowest energy, Ebeam =196.0 MeV, we find that\n23 events fall within the expected evaporation residue\nwindow as illustrated in Fig. 1b. Most of these events are\nsuspiciously close to an intense band of scattered beam\nparticles which borders the fusion evaporation residue\nwindow. By examining the \u2206E5 vs. t3 spectrum shown\nin Fig. 2b, it is evident that only one of these events falls\nwithin the expected range of the \u2206E5 signal. However,\nthis event does not have the correct m/q-value as will be\ndemonstrated below.\nAn m/q spectrum containing the 23 events that fall\ninside the \u2206E6 \u2212 t3 window is given in Fig. 3b. This\nspectrum is spread out over the whole m/q range and\ndoes not appear to be associated with fusion evaporation\nresidue events seen at higher energies to be concentrated\nnear channels 103 and 145 (see Fig. 3a). The only candidate event at E=196.0 MeV, which satisfies the conditions for the \u2206E5 , \u2206E6 , and t3 signals, appears in channel 114 as seen in Fig. 3b. By further checking all the\ndetector signals for this event, it was concluded that it\nis a background event, probably arising from scatterings\nof a beam particle at several locations through the spectrometer. Hence, only an upper limit for the measured\ncross section could be determined at this beam energy.\nThese results show that a background suppression factor of about 4\u00d710\u221217 can be achieved with the upgraded\nFMA and the present detector system.\nThe uncertainties in the reported evaporation cross\nsections arise mainly from corrections for the charged\nstate distribution, the FMA transport efficiency, the detector efficiency, and counting statistics. The total uncertainties for the evaporation cross sections are around\n10-17%, except for the measurements at the two lowest\nenergies where only upper limits can be given. The cross\nsections are listed in Table I.\nThe fusion-fission cross sections for 64 Ni + 100 Mo have\nnot been measured previously. They were, however,\ncalculated in Ref. [15] with the code CASCADE [24].\nSimilar calculations with the same parameters were performed for the present experiment. The total fusion\ncross sections are also listed in Table I, together with the\nfusion-fission cross sections. Rather large uncertainties\nwere given for the fusion-fission contributions resulting\nin somewhat larger errors for the total cross sections at\nthe highest beam energies.\nThe experimental results for the total fusion cross sections, spanning eight orders of magnitude, are presented\nas a function of laboratory energy in Fig. 4 (solid circles). The incident energies have been corrected for target thickness and for the steep energy dependence; these\ncorrections are small because rather thin targets were\nused. For the lowest two energies no evaporation residue\nwas observed. The results are shown as upper limits cor-\n\n\f4\nTABLE I: Measured fusion evaporation cross sections and\ncalculated fusion-fission cross sections (using the code CASCADE) for the 64 Ni + 100 Mo system.

[15] reproduced the excitation function quite well down to the 0.5\nmb level. It was found that with the same coupling parameters, the calculations cannot reproduce the new data\nat lower beam energies. In fact, in the literature there\nare not many such calculations that can reproduce successfully experimental data for heavy systems. Since the\nnucleus 100 Mo is rather soft, multi-phonon states and\nlarge coupling effects should be included in the calculations and this represents a challenge. In the following,\ntwo sets of coupled-channels calculations are presented,\nincluding two- and three-phonon states, respectively.\nThe nuclear structure input for the calculations is given\n\nTABLE III: Energies and reduced transition probabilities of\nthe I = 0,2 and 4 transitions.\nNucleus\nI\u03c0\n\n64\n\nNi\nEI\nB(E2, I \u2192 2)\n(MeV)\n(W.u.)\n0+\n2.867\n110\n2\n2+\n2.277\n0\n2\n2.610\n<37\n4+\n1\nEffective-2ph 2.87-2.75\n22-41\n<2ph|\u03b120 |1ph>\n\u221a\n0.177-0.242\n2/5\n\n100\n\nMo\nEI B(E2, I \u2192 2)\n(MeV)\n(W.u.)\n0.695\n92\n1.064\n51\n1.136\n69\n1.002\n68\n0.222\n\n\f5\nion potential was parametrized as a Woods-Saxon well\nwith a depth of V0 = -82.9 MeV, diffuseness a = 0.686\nfm, and nuclear radius RN = 10.19 + \u2206R fm.\n\nFIG. 4: Fusion excitation function for the system 64 Ni +\n100\nMo (solid circles).

[16] (open squares).\n\nFIG. 5: Fusion excitation function for 64 Ni + 100 Mo compared with several calculations described in the text.\n\nin Table II. The structure input for 64 Ni is the same\nas used in Ref. [10] to analyze the 64 Ni + 64 Ni fusionevaporation excitation function. The nuclear quadrupole\ncoupling, \u03b2\u03bbN , for 64 Ni was set \u223c 10% higher than the\nvalue for Coulomb coupling, \u03b2\u03bbC , (for reasons discussed\nin Ref. [26]). For simplicity, it was assumed that the\nquadrupole mode corresponds to a perfect vibrator. This\nis not unreasonable, considering the uncertainty of the\npredicted one- and two-phonon couplings shown in Table\nIII. The structure input for 100 Mo is also given in Table\nII. Here, the nuclear \u03b2-values were also set \u223c 10% higher\nthan the Coulomb \u03b2-values.\nThe two-phonon (2ph) calculations include the 2+ and\n3\u2212 one-phonon states in both nuclei, as well as mutual\nexcitations and the two-phonon states listed in Table II.\nThe two-phonon octupole excitation of 100 Mo was also\nincluded. The two-phonon states were treated as perfect vibrational states. This gives a total number of 14\ncoupled channels. The three-phonon (3ph) calculations\nadditionally include all mutual excitations of the states\nconsidered in the 2ph calculations up to two mutual twophonon states. Moreover, the estimated three-phonon\nexcitation of the 2+ state in 100 Mo shown in table II was\nalso included. However, states above 5.5 MeV were not\nincluded, so the total number of channels is 31. The ion-\n\nIf the value of \u2206R=0.06 fm was used in the two-phonon\ncalculations, the result is similar to the calculations in\nRef. [15], and it agrees quite well with the data for\nthe excitation function above the 0.5 mb level. This\ntwo-phonon calculation is shown in Fig. 5 as the dotteddashed curve and it is evident that it does not reproduce\nthe data well at low energies. We have also tried the\nrecipe of a larger diffuseness (up to ai =5 fm) inside the\nCoulomb barrier, which was described in Ref. [9], but\nthis did not result in any significant improvement of the\nfit to the data.\nA value of \u2206R = 0.21 fm was needed to reproduce the\npresent data in the cross section region of 0.1 to 100 \u03bcb.\nThe potential with this \u2206R value produces a Coulomb\nbarrier of 134 MeV, and a pocket inside the Coulomb\nbarrier at 112.9 MeV, which is about 20 MeV higher than\nthe ground state energy of the compound nucleus at 92.3\nMeV. The value of \u2206R = 0.21 fm was also adopted in\nthe 3ph calculations. The result is shown as the solid\ncurve in Fig. 5, which is seen to provide a better fit to\nthe data in the 0.1 to 100 \u03bcb cross section range. The\ndashed curve shows as a reference the results obtained in\na one-dimensional calculation, i.e., without any couplings\n(with \u2206R = 0.21 fm). It should be emphasized that the\ndifference between the two sets of calculations, using the\nsame \u2206R = 0.21 fm, is rather modest. Hence, the 2ph\n\n\f6\ncalculation with \u2206R = 0.21 fm is not shown for clarity.\nThese two calculations reproduce the experimental data\nin the highest energy region and in the 0.1 to 10 \u03bcb range,\nbut the cross sections in the region around E=130 MeV\nare overpredicted. These calculations also overpredict\nthe cross sections at the lowest energies, which is the\nmain topic of the present study.\nThe coupled-channels calculations shown in Fig. 5 exhibit essentially the same energy dependence (slope) as\nthe one-dimensional calculation when the cross sections\nare small (< 10 \u03bcb). The coupled-channels calculations\nare just shifted to lower energies relative to the onedimensional calculation. In the present case the shift\nis about 7 MeV (for the same \u2206R = 0.21 fm). This\nis a general feature of coupled-channels calculations and\nit is, therefore, very unlikely that any minor adjustment\nin the coupled-channels calculations would reproduce the\nsteep falloff that the data exhibit at extreme sub-barrier\nenergies. Thus, it appears that the fusion hindrance behavior, which now has been observed for many systems,\nis also present in the new data for 64 Ni+100 Mo. This will\nbe shown more convincingly in the next section, where\nother representations of the fusion cross section are discussed.\nFrom the experimental data and calculations alike,\none can infer a rather broad, about 18 MeV wide,\nbarrier distribution (not shown here). An elaborate\ncoupling scheme is therefore needed in the coupledchannels calculations. At energies above the barrier,\none-dimensional calculations result in higher cross sections when compared to coupled-channels calculations.\nThis behavior is caused by the long-range Coulombexcitation/polarization of the low-lying quadrupole\nstates, as pointed out in Ref. [15]. As expected, the suppression of the coupled-channels fusion cross sections is\nrather strong in this region for the \"soft\" 100 Mo nucleus.\n\nIV.\n\nLOGARITHMIC DERIVATIVES AND\nS-FACTORS\n\nThe logarithmic derivative, L = d ln(\u03c3E)/dE, originally introduced in Ref. [8], is shown in Fig. 6a for the\n64\nNi + 100 Mo system. The solid circles were obtained directly from two successive data points, whereas the stars\nwere derived from least-squares fits to three neighboring\ndata points. The lower limit of the logarithmic derivative\nwas derived from the upper limit on the cross section at\nEcm =120.2 MeV and the data point at Ecm =121.2 MeV\n(see Table I). The present data are compared to those of\nRefs. [15, 16], which are represented by open circles and\nsolid triangles in Fig. 6a, respectively. Only two-point\nderivatives are shown for these data. The three-phonon\ncoupled-channels and the one-dimensional barrier penetration calculations are shown as solid and dashed curves,\nrespectively, while the thick solid, nearly horizontal line\ncorresponds to a constant S-factor expression derived in\nRef. [9]. The present experimental results just reach\n\nFIG. 6: (a) Logarithmic derivative representation of the 64 Ni\n+ 100 Mo fusion excitation function. (b) S-factor representation of the same data. All the circles were obtained from\ntwo successive data points and stars were derived from least\nsquare fits to three neighboring data points. Calculations are\nshown by curves. The extrapolation curve (dashed-dotted)\nshown in panel (b) was obtained from a straight line extrapolation of the logarithmic derivative representation in panel\n(a). Included in (a) are also the data from Ref. [15] (solid\ntriangles) and Ref. [16] (open circles). See text for details.\n\nthe constant S-factor line, implying that the experimental data have reached a maximum value for the S-factor.\nThe energy, Es , representing the intersection between the\nexperimental logarithmic derivatives and the constant Sfactor line corresponds to a value of Es =120.6 MeV. The\ndashed-dotted line in Fig. 6a is an extrapolation obtained\nunder the assumption that the logarithmic derivative is\na straight line near the crossing point. This method was\nfirst introduced in Ref. [10] in order to obtain the extrapolated values of Es for the systems 58 Ni + 60 Ni and\n58\nNi + 64 Ni. The calculated logarithmic derivatives are\nseen to saturate around L=1.5 - 2 MeV\u22121 (or start to oscillate) below Ecm =124 MeV, whereas the corresponding\nexperimental values continue to grow with decreasing energies. This saturation behavior has already been noted\nin Refs. [8, 9, 10].\nThe S-factor representation for the 64 Ni + 100 Mo system is presented in Fig. 6b. As the experimental logarithmic derivatives only just reach the constant S-factor\ncurve, the S-factor maximum is not fully developed.

It is evident that coupledchannels calculations overpredict the fusion cross section\nat extreme sub-barrier energies.\n\nV.\n\nCOMPARISON TO OTHER NI-INDUCED\nFUSION SYSTEMS\n\nThe experimental fusion data involving Ni projectiles and compound nuclei in the A=100 - 200 region,\nare summarized in Table IV. For four systems, namely\nthe 58 Ni+58 Ni, 64 Ni+64 Ni, 60 Ni+89 Y and the present\n64\nNi+100 Mo reactions, the cross sections have been measured to sufficiently low energies to determine the energy,\nEs of the maximum of the S-factor representation. Previously, we have obtained the Es values for the 58 Ni+60 Ni\nand 58 Ni+64 Ni systems [9]. The values of Es are listed\nin column three of Table IV. Two additional systems,\nnamely 58 Ni+74 Ge and 64 Ni+74 Ge from Ref.[13], have\nbeen measured down to levels close to where the S-factor\nmaximum occurs. The logarithmic derivative for these\nsystems is shown in Fig. 7.

The\nresulting values are listed in Table IV. Because of the uncertainties inherent in these extrapolations, errors of 2%\n(\u223c2 MeV) were assigned to the extrapolated Es data. Table IV also lists other fusion systems involving Ni beams\nfor which the cross section was not measured down to a\nlevel that allows for determination of the S-factor maximum. For these systems only the lowest measured energy\nis listed.\nThe values p\nof Es are plotted as a function of the parameter Z1 Z2 A1 A2 /(A1 + A2 ) in Fig. 8 and compared\nto the empirical formula (solid curve), Eq. 1, obtained\nfrom a fit to all available fusion data involving stiff nuclei.\nObviously, only two systems, 58 Ni+58 Ni and 60 Ni+89 Y\nfollow the systematics; all other systems fall below the\ncurve. Previously, it has been pointed out [10] that there\nis a rather compelling correlation between the stiffness of\nthe interacting nuclei and the location of the S-factor\nmaximum, Es , relative to the empirical trend for the\nNi+Ni systems. The addition to the systematics of the\ndata points for 64 Ni+100 Mo and for the two Ni+Ge systems, which all involve soft nuclei, appears to corroborate this observation. Thus, for the 64 Ni+100 Mo system,\nthe value of Esref predicted from Eq. 1 is Esref =134.5\nMeV whereas the measured value of Es =120.6 MeV is\n\n\f8\nonly 90% of this value. The reason for this reduction\nis presumably that 64 Ni + 100 Mo should be viewed as\nan open-shell colliding system so that strong coupling effects broaden the effective barrier distribution and push\nthe energy where the hindrance behavior occurs down to\neven lower energies.\n\n\u221a\nFIG. 8: Plot of Es vs. Z1 Z2 \u03bc for Ni bombarding different targets (see Table IV). Solid symbols correspond to\nsystems for which the S-factor maximum is well determined:\n58\nNi+58 Ni, 64 Ni+64 Ni, 60 Ni+89 Y and 64 Ni+100 Mo. Open\nsymbols are associated with the extrapolations for the systems\n58\nNi+60 Ni, 58 Ni+64 Ni, 58 Ni+74 Ge and 64 Ni+74 Ge.

The\ndata are from Ref. [13].\n\nThe deviation of the measured or extrapolated values\nof Es from the expected Esref value, seen in Fig. 8, thus\nappears to depend on the stiffness of the fusing nuclei.\nA quantitative relation between the stiffness and the deviation from Esref is not yet known. As a first attempt,\nwe associate the stiffness of a nucleus to its proximity\nto closed proton or neutron shells and define the number of \"valence nucleons\", Nph , as the sum of particles\nand holes outside the nearest closed shells. Here, 64 Ni\nis considered to have four holes in the N=40 neutron\nshell rather than eight particles outside N=28. The values of Nph are listed in Table IV and, in Fig. 9, the ratio\nEs /Esref is plotted as a function of this parameter. There\nis a general trend of decreasing values of Es /Esref with\nincreasing values of Nph . We observe that for the other\nsystems in Table IV, the data for Emin (upper limits)\nare not in contradiction with Figs. 8 and 9. It should\nbe noted that all of the systems shown in Figs. 8 and 9\nand Table IV have rather large negative fusion Q\u2212values.\nOne may also compare the Es -values to the height of the\nCoulomb barrier (obtained from the Bass prescription),\n\nFIG. 9: Plot of Es /Esref vs. Nph , where Nph is the total number of \"valence nucleons\" outside closed shells in the entrance\nchannel.

The ratio Es /Esref exhibit a\nstronger dependency on the value of Nph than that obtained for the ratio Es /Vc indicating that the observed\neffect does not just depend on the change in the Coulomb\nbarrier height with addition of neutrons to the interacting nuclei.\n\n\f9\nVI.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe above observations are all phenomenological in nature as there is at present no satisfactory understanding\nof the fusion hindrance at extreme sub-barrier energies.\nMany authors have tried to explain this new phenomenon\n[29, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41]. One suggestion is to use a\nlarge diffuseness of the ion-ion potential in the coupledchannels calculations. This recipe is sometimes used to\nexplain high-precision fusion data [29]. It has been argued that the failure to reproduce the steep fall-off is\ncaused by the Hill-Wheeler approximation [36, 37]. In\nRef. [9] it was shown, however, that these limitations\nof the analysis are not responsible for the observed subbarrier fusion hindrance phenomenon. Dasso and Pollarolo tried to reduce the fusion cross sections by using\na shallow well inside the barrier [38]. Giraud et al. investigated the effect of \"friction\" [39]. More discussions\nabout this phenomenon can be found in Refs. [40, 41].\nAll of these suggestions may improve the fit of calculations to the experimental data in some cases, but they\ndo not provide a convincing explanation of the observed\nsuppression in all systems. These studies are presently\nat the stage of raising questions and discovering weak\npoints in the existing models. The data are most likely\nstill insufficient to lead to the correct explanation. More\nprecision sub-barrier fusion measurements are required\nto further explore which modifications in the theoretical models are relevant for a correct description of the\nphenomenon.\nVII.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\n\nple expression [8, 9] was derived for the energy at which\nthe hindrance of fusion between such nuclei occurs. Furthermore, a study of Ni+Ni fusion involving different Ni\nisotopes [10] has shown that the onset of the fusion hindrance deviates from these systematics depending on the\n\"stiffness\" of the interacting nuclei.\nIn the present work, we have measured the fusion excitation function for the system 64 Ni+100 Mo down to a\ncross section level of \u223c5 nb, i.e. about 12% below the\nBass barrier. We observe that the fusion process is hindered at the lowest energies relative to expectations based\non coupled-channels calculations. The present study of\nthe 64 Ni+100 Mo system shows that the fusion hindrance\nfor this system, as well as two other soft systems, deviates\nstrongly from the systematics, and it thus corroborates\nthe earlier observation in Ni+Ni systems. It is furthermore shown that this deviation depends monotonically\non a parameter Nph , which is the sum of nucleons (holes)\noutside of closed shells of the fusing nuclei suggesting that\nthis parameter is a good measure of the \"stiffness\" of the\ninteracting nuclei.\nIn conclusion, an interesting nuclear structure dependence of the fusion hindrance has been observed. The\norigin of this effect is still unknown. It occurs at relatively high excitation energies (for systems in Fig. 8 and\n9, they are around Eex \u223c 30 - 40 MeV), where the natural width of compound levels is larger than their spacing.\nA lack of available final states thus appears to be ruled\nout as an explanation.\n\nThe phenomenon of sub-barrier fusion hindrance was\nfirst observed in systems involving stiff nuclei and a sim-\n\nAcknowledgments This work was supported by the\nUS Department of Energy, Office of Nuclear Physics, under Contract Nos.
