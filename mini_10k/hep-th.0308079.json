Much attention has been paid also to quantum field theories on NC\nspaces, in particular NC Yang-Mills gauge theory as well as NC-QED, a subject\nwhich has matured as an area of intense research activity in more recent times [46]. In fact it has been established by Seiberg and Witten [2] that the existence of\nnoncommutativity in open string boundaries in the presence of the NS-NS B field\nresults in NC D-branes to which the open string endpoints are attached. Related\nto these stimulating ideas, a wide number of papers were devoted to study several\naspects of the NC [7 ].\nOne particular property of NCG framework is its richness and also the fact that we\ncan discover the standard results just by requiring the vanishing of the deformed parameter which means also the vanishing of noncommutativity. Note that the passage\nfrom commutative to NC space time is simply achieved by replacing the ordinary\nproduct, in the space of smooth functions on R2 with coordinates (x, t), by the NC\nassociative \u2217 product. Works having used this NC formalism are various and the\nresults found are numerous, we will limit ourselves to mention some of them, namely\n[8-14].\nThe aim of this paper is to study another aspect of the noncommutativity framework adapted to the Feynman's proof of Maxwell equations [15-19]. As well known,\na century ago, Maxwell brought four basic laws dealing with electromagnetism, these\nlaws describe the evolution in time and space of the electric and magnetic fields E\nand B. Together with the Lorentz force law, the Maxwell equations constitute a\ncomplete description of electromagnetism (the Maxwell theory). Furthermore these\nequations have different forms, vectorial, differential and can be proved in different\nway. Feynman in 1948 has given a proof of these equations, assuming only Newton's\nlaw of motion and the commutation relation between position and velocity for a single nonrelativistic particle. The importance of this proof emerged notably with the\nDyson's work [15]. As signaled in this work, the motivation of Feynman was to build\na new theory outside the framework of conventional physics, but his assumptions\nusing these commutation relations and the Newton's equation were not lead to new\nphysics [15]. This proof, although based on simple mathematical assumptions, is\nshown to give rise to nontrivial generalizations [16-19].\nAmong many possible existing extensions, we are going to adapt thereafter the\nNC framework to the Feynman's proof, a fact which leads us to extract important\nresults. We present two kind of NC formulations and show in a first one that the application of the Feynman's proof in NC space, leads to the static Maxwell equations.\nFocusing to obtain a new theory, we propose in our second formulation to modify\nthe Moyal bracket between the position xi and the velocity x \u0307j . This task can be\neasily accomplished by assuming that the velocity is space dependent and then the\n2\n\n\fstar product between xi and x \u0307j becomes non trivial. This assumption will modify\nthe Maxwell equations, giving rise to a new theory where extra terms proportional\nto NC \u03b8 -parameter appear. The results extracted from the second formulation are\nmore significant as they are associated to a non trivial \u03b8-extension of the Bianchi-set\n2\n\u2202E\ns\nof Maxwell equations namely div\u03b8 B = \u03b7\u03b8 and \u2202B\n+ \u01ebkjs \u2202xkj = A1 ddt2f + A2 df\n+ A3 ,\n\u2202t\ndt\nwhere \u03b7\u03b8 , A1 , A2 and A3 are local functions depending on the NC \u03b8-parameter.\nOur objectives in reconsidering the Feynman's proof are, on one hand, to put it\nin relief and, on the other hand, to show its importance in the NC framework. The\nnovelty of this proof formulated in the NC space is revealed notably at the level\nof the corrections brought to the standard Maxwell equations. These corrections\ncorrespond essentially to the possibility of existence of sources of magnetic charges\nthat we can associate to the magnetic monopole since div\u03b8 B = \u03b7\u03b8 . Note that these\nextra terms \u03b7\u03b8 are absent in the ordinary case associated to \u03b8 = 0. These results\nmay give new insights into the study of the electromagnetic duality and its various\nphysical and mathematical aspects.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we summarize some properties\nof the Poisson manifold and review the Feynman's proof of the Maxwell equations.\nIn section 3 we present some useful identities of \u2217 product after that we examine\nthe Feynman'proof of Maxwell equations in NC spaces. Section 4 is devoted to our\nconcluding remarks.\n\n2\n\nMaxwell Equations: The Feynman's Proof\n\nMaxwell equations have played a pioneering role in physics and they continue to\nnourish several axes of research either in physics or in mathematics. Their formulations as well as the survey of their solutions constitute a topic of a big interest\n[20] and it's in this context that are located the famous theories of Yang-Mills. Recently, we attended to a new approach leading to the derivation of these equations\nand based on what is called the Feynman's proof of Maxwell equations. Details\nconcerning this approach are presented in the Dyson's work [15]. Later on, several\nauthors took this approach and tried to put in relief the Feynman's idea and to\ndevelop it or sometimes to generalize it to other contexts [16-19]. Before reviewing\nthe Feynman's proof of the Maxwell equations, lets first start by introducing some\nbasic algebraic properties of the underlying Poisson manifold M\n\n2.1\n\nSome algebraic properties\n\nIn fact the previous approach can be simply stated in the general way as finding all\nPoisson tensors on a phase space manifold such that they have Hamiltonian vector\nfields which correspond to second order differential equations such that {q i , q j } = 0,\nwith the symbol {, } standing for the Poisson bracket defined usually as\n\n3\n\n\f{f, g} =\n\n\u2202f \u2202g\n\u2202f \u2202g\n\u2212 i\ni\n\u2202q \u2202pi \u2202p \u2202qi\n\n(1)\n\nwhere f and g are two functional of q and p. Denoting by A the algebra of\nclassical observables on the manifold M, one can define a Poisson structure {, } :\nA \u00d7 A \u2192 A on this manifold as been a skew-symmetric bilinear map such that:\na) (A , {, }) satisfies the Jacobi identity\n{F, {G, H}} + {H, {F, G}} + {G, {H, F }} = 0\n\n(2)\n\nb) The map XF = {., F } defines a derivation on M of the associative algebra A(M),\nthat is, it satisfies the Leibnitz rule\n{F, GH} = G{F, H} + {F, G}H\n\n(3)\n\nA manifold endowed with such a Poisson bracket on A(M) is called a Poisson\nmanifold. Furthermore, consider a Poisson manifold P, for any H \u2208 A(P), there is\na unique vector field XH on P such that\nXH G = {G, H}\n\n(4)\n\nfor all G \u2208 A(P). XH is nothing but the Hamiltonian vector field of H. Now one\ncan define a dynamical system on the Poisson manifold M just by considering for\nany function H \u2208 A the following differential equation\ndF\n= {F, H}\ndt\n\n(5)\n\nMoreover, one can also express the Poisson bracket {F, G} in any set of local coordinates (xa ) in the following way\n{F, G} = XG F = {xa , G}\n\n2.2\n\n\u2202F\n\u2202xa\n\n(6)\n\nThe Feynman's Proof.\n\nThis section is devoted to an explicit remind of the main steps involved into the\nFeynman's proof of the Maxwell equations in their classical form [15, 16]. Our\nobjective is to present these calculations in order to make a comparison with the NC\ncase to be discussed later. This proof is essentially based on the Newton's laws of the\nnon relativistic classical mechanics and on the relations of commutation joining the\ncoordinates of position and velocity of a single non relativistic particle. An extension\nto the relativistic case is naturally possible [17, 19] and may leads to important\nresults more notably in connection with quantum field theory approaches. The\nmanifold we consider is parameterized by local coordinate variables (w a ) = (xi , \u1e8bi )\nof a non relativistic particle whose position xj (j = 1, 2, 3) and velocity x \u0307j satisfy the\nNewton's equation\n4\n\n\fmx \u0308j = Fj (x, \u1e8b, t),\n\n(7)\n\n{xj , xk } = 0,\n\n(8)\n\nm{xj , x \u0307k } = ih\u0304\u03b4jk .\n\n(9)\n\nwith commutation relations\n\nThen, there exist a couple of fields E(x, t) and B(x, t) that we can identify with the\nelectric and the magnetic fields respectively such that we get the Lorentz force law\nFj = Ej + \u01ebjkl x \u0307k Bl ,\n\n(10)\n\nand the first couple of the Maxwell equations\ndivB = 0,\n\u2202B\n+ \u2207 \u00d7 E = 0.\n\u2202t\nThe second couple of Maxwell equations\ndivE = 4\u03c0\u03c1,\n\n(11)\n(12)\n\n(13)\n\n\u2202E\n\u2212 \u2207 \u00d7 B = 4\u03c0j,\n(14)\n\u2202t\nmerely defines the external charge and the current densities \u03c1 and j respectively.\nThe Feynman's proof starts by differentiating the bracket (9) with respect to time\nand using (7), we have\n{xj , Fk } + m{x \u0307j , x \u0307k } = 0.\n(15)\nThen using the Jacobi identity\n{xl , {x \u0307j , x \u0307k }} + {x \u0307j , {x \u0307k , xl }} + {x \u0307k , {xl , x \u0307j }} = 0\n\n(16)\n\nas well as the bilinearity of the Poisson bracket we find the following constraint\nequation\n{xl , {xj , Fk }} = 0.\n(17)\nFurthermore, since the bracket is antisymmetric the tensor {xj , Fk } satisfy\n{xj , Fk } = \u2212{xk , Fj },\n\n(18)\n\nh\u0304\n\u01ebjkl Bl .\nm\n\n(19)\n\nand therefore we may write\n{xj , Fk } = \u2212i\n\nThis equation gives a definition of the field B whose components are Bl . This shows\nthat B would in general depend on coordinates x, \u1e8b of the Poisson manifold M and\npossibly time t. Combining (17) with equation for Bl (19) lead to\n{xl , Bm } = 0.\n5\n\n(20)\n\n\fOn account of the basic equations (8-9), this means that B is a function of the\ncoordinates x and t of the particle. Therefore, its shown that the vectors E and B\nare not independent as we have\n{xm , Ej } = 0,\n\n(21)\n\nwhich says that E is also a function of x and t only.\nNow we have two equations (15) and (19) that we naturally need to compare. The\nway to do this consist simply in writing B as\nm2\n\u01ebjkl {x \u0307j , x \u0307k }.\n2h\u0304\nAnother application of the Jacobi identity gives\nBl = \u2212i\n\n\u01ebjkl {\u1e8bl , {x \u0307j , x \u0307k }} = 0,\n\n(22)\n\n(23)\n\nleading naturally to the first Maxwell equation divB = 0 (11) namely\n{\u1e8bl , Bl } = 0.\n\n(24)\n\nIndeed,\n{Bl , \u1e8bl } = {xa , \u1e8bl }\n\n\u2202Bl\n\u2202xa\n\nih\u0304 \u2202Bl\n\u03b4al\nm \u2202xa\nih\u0304\ndivB\n=\nm\n= 0.\n=\n\n(25)\n\nThe proof of the second Maxwell equation (12) starts from deriving both sides of\n(22) with respect to time. This gives\n\u2202Bl\nim2\n\u2202Bl\n=\u2212\n+ x \u0307m\n\u01ebjkl {x \u0308j , x \u0307k }.\n\u2202t\n\u2202xm\nh\u0304\n\n(26)\n\nNow by virtue of (7) and (10), the right side of (26) becomes\n\u2212\n\nim\nim\n\u01ebjkl {Ej + \u01ebjab x \u0307a Bb , x \u0307k } = \u2212\n(\u01ebjkl {Ej , x \u0307k } + {x \u0307k Bl , x \u0307k } \u2212 {\u1e8bl Bk , x \u0307k })\nh\u0304\nh\u0304\n\u2202Ej\n\u2202Bl\n\u2202Bk im\n= \u01ebjkl\n+ x \u0307k\n\u2212 \u1e8bl\n+\nBk {\u1e8bl , x \u0307k }. (27)\n\u2202xk\n\u2202xk\n\u2202xk\nh\u0304\n\nOn the right side of (27), the last term is zero by virtue of (22), the third term\nvanishes also as it describes exactly the first Maxwell equation. Now identifying\nl.h.s and r.h.s of (26), we get\n\u2202Ej\n\u2202Bl\n,\n(28)\n= \u01ebjkl\n\u2202t\n\u2202xk\n6\n\n\fwhich is nothing but the second Maxwell equation (12).\nThis is the way followed by Feynman to prove the Maxwell equations in their classical form. His motivation was to \"discover a new theory not to reinvent the old\none\", but the proof showed him that his assumptions (7-9) were not leading to new\nphysics. As was the case for several authors who find interesting the Feynman's\napproach, we project in the forthcoming section to go beyond this approach and\nsetup the Feynman's proof in a non-commutative space. The way to apply the noncommutativity is by replacing ordinary product by star product and Poisson bracket\nor ordinary commutators by the Moyal bracket.\n\n3\n\nThe Feynman's proof in the NC geometry framework\n\nThe passage to NC geometry, based essentially on the noncommutativity of spacetime coordinates, is justified among others by its importance in different currents\nof research more particularly in high energy physics. The deep idea behind the\nnoncommutativity of coordinates is that in a certain microscopic regime our standard\nconception of the space-time is not more applicable. Such a regime is characterized\nby domains of area \u03b8 where the space-time loses its condition of continuum and\nbecomes subject to the following new structure [x\u03bc , x\u03bd ]\u2217 = x\u03bc \u2217 x\u03bd \u2212 x\u03bd \u2217 x\u03bc =\ni\u03b8\u03bc\u03bd ,where \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd is a real antisymmetric constant matrix and [.,.]\u2217 is the Moyal bracket.\nOne way of incorporating noncommutativity of coordinates in the context of field\ntheory is through the Moyal product based on the \u2217-product that will be introduced\nlatter on. To avoid hard notations, we will later on simply denote the Moyal bracket\nby [.,.]. Before going on, let us first recall briefly some useful identities of the \u2217product.\n\n3.1\n\nSome properties of \u2217-product\n\nRecently the star product marks a remarkable success due to its intervention in\ndifferent aspects of string theory greatly related to NC geometry. In this section,\nwe give some useful properties of this star product as well as of the Moyal bracket\n[9,10]. To define this object, lets start by considering two functions f (x) and g(x)\nsuch that\ni\n\nf (x) \u2217 g(x) = e 2\n\n\u03b8 ab \u2202\u03be\u2202a\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03b7 b\n\nf (x + \u03be)g(x + \u03b7)/\u03be = \u03b7 = 0,\n\n(29)\n\nwhere \u03b8ab is a constant, of dimension [L]2 , known as the NC parameter1 . This\nformula leads naturally to what is often called the Moyal bracket of functions.\n[f (x), g(x)] = f (x) \u2217 g(x) \u2212 g(x) \u2217 f (x).\n1\n\nIn all the parts of this paper the parameter \u03b8 is considered as a constant matrix.\n\n7\n\n(30)\n\n\fAccording to this definition, the commutation relation for the space coordinates\nbecomes\n[xi , xj ] = i\u03b8ij .\n(31)\nSuch a structure describes a NC space for which the space coordinates are not necessarily commuting. Note by the way that the function f (x) may depend on space\ncoordinates as it can depend on space-time coordinates.\nWe collect here bellow some useful properties.\n1)Associativity\n(f \u2217 g) \u2217 h = f \u2217 (g \u2217 h).\n\n(32)\n\n[f, [g, h]] + [g, [h, f ]] + [h, [f, g]] = 0.\n\n(33)\n\n[f, g \u2217 h] = g \u2217 [f, h] + [f, g] \u2217 h.\n\n(34)\n\nf \u2217 (g + h) = (f \u2217 g) + (f \u2217 h).\n\n(35)\n\n2)Jacobi identity\n\n3)Leibnitz rule\n\n4)Linearity\n\nThe star product is also compatible with integration\nZ\n\nT r(f \u2217 g) =\n\nZ\n\nT r(g \u2217 f ),\n\n(36)\n\nwhere T r is the ordinary trace of the N \u00d7 N matrices, and is the ordinary integration of functions.\nAnother useful identity is given in term of local coordinates (xa ). For two functions\nF (x) and G(x), the coordinate expression for the Moyal bracket [F, G] is\nR\n\n[F, G] = [xa , G]\n\n\u2202F\n.\n\u2202xa\n\n(37)\n\nMore details about the origin of the \u2217 product and other important properties are\navailable in literature [9-13]. Next, we will study the Feynman's proof of Maxwell\nequations using the NC framework, a fact which consist also in using the Moyal\nbracket instead of the Poisson bracket. In what follows we will present two kind of\nNC framework associated to two distinguished scenarios to conceive the proof of the\nMaxwell equations in a NC space. These two scenarios offering two possibilities to\nmake the space NC permit among others to debate the novelty extracted from this\nextension relatively to each case.\n\n8\n\n\f3.2\n\nNoncommutativity: First kind\n\nOne way to make the space NC is to consider the following commutation relations\n[xj , xk ] = i\u03b8jk ,\n\n(38)\n\nm[xj , x \u0307k ] = ih\u0304\u03b4jk ,\n\n(39)\n\nwhere [, ] stands for the Moyal bracket and where (38) is simply a NC extension of\n(8). We assume in this first kind of noncommutativity that the r.h.s of (39) is not\naffected by the deformation parameter. Differentiating this equation with respect to\ntime and using (7) we find the same equation as in the ordinary product (9), since\nthe NC parameter \u03b8jk is a constant\n[xj , Fk ] + m[x \u0307j , x \u0307k ] = 0.\n\n(40)\n\nOn the other hand, the bilinearity of the Moyal bracket implies\n[[xi , Fj ], xk ] + m[[\u1e8bi , x \u0307j ], xk ] = 0.\n\n(41)\n\nComputing the second term of this equation, using the Jacobi identity of \u1e8bi , x \u0307j and\nxk as well as the Moyal bracket of xj and x \u0307k (39), we find the following constraint\n[[\u1e8bi , x \u0307j ], xk ] = 0,\n\n(42)\n\n[[xi , Fj ], xk ] = 0.\n\n(43)\n\nor by virtue of (40)\nCompared to the standard computations, the present case shows a new property\nnamely the quantity [xi , Fj ] is coordinate space independent, and hence the field B\ndefined by\nm2\nBl = \u2212i \u01ebjkl [x \u0307j , x \u0307k ]\n(44)\n2h\u0304\nis also independent of xi . Consequently, the corresponding equations for H read as\ndivB =\n\n\u2202Bl\n= 0,\n\u2202xl\n\n(45)\n\nand\nrotB = \u2207 \u00d7 B = 0.\n\n(46)\n\nMoreover, using (39) and (44), the field E defined by the Lorentz force equation\n(10), satisfies then\n[xm , Ej ] = 0.\n(47)\nThe above equation shows that the field E is also space independent which, in turn,\ngives the following equations\ndivE = 0,\n(48)\nand\nrotE = 0.\n9\n\n(49)\n\n\fFew remarks are in order:\n1. The fact to introduce a parameter of noncommutativity to the manner of\n(38), induces necessarily the static Maxwell equations which means also the absence\nof the charge and current densities \u03c1 and j . We can advance at this level that the\nnoncommutativity of the first kind is equivalent to cancel the charge and current\ndensities for the Maxwell equations.\n2. It's important to look for the meaning of the commutative limit \u03b8 = 0. In\nfact, once the previous limit is performed, the behavior of the Lorentz force F as\nwell as of the field B change completely as they depend on the behavior of the space\ncoordinates xm . Setting \u03b8 = 0 one discover the Poison bracket {xj , xk } = 0 which,\nby virtue of the standard computations, means the restoration of the densities \u03c1 and\nj.\n\n3.3\n\nNoncommutativity: Second Kind\n\nAs its shown through the previous calculations, the relation (9) constitutes a crucial\nstep in the Feynman's proof. Any changes at the level of this relation will necessarily\nlead important modifications and all the standards results are then suspected to\nchange. Here we propose to consider the NC space (38) and modify the equation\n(39) while supposing that velocity is a quantity that depends on spatial coordinates.\nWe suppose the following NC expressions\n[xj , xk ] = i\u03b8jk ,\n\n(50)\n\nm[xj , x \u0307k ] = ih\u0304\u03b4jk + im\u03b8jk f,\n\n(51)\n\nwhere f is a function which can depend on x and t and it's given by\nf=\n\n\u2202 \u1e8bl\n(x + \u03b7)\n\u2202\u03b7l\n\n!\n\n(52)\n\n\u03b7=0.\n\nNote that the equation (51) is established by using the definition of the star product\nand assuming that\n\u2202 \u1e8bl\n\u2202 x \u0307k\n= \u03b4kb\n.\n(53)\n\u2202\u03b7b\n\u2202\u03b7l\nNote also that the velocity should not be proportional to the position due to the\npresence of the term ih\u0304\u03b4jk in (51).\nHowever, following step by step the Feynman's analysis [15], one shows that the\nderivation of (51) with respect to time t drives naturally to the following expression\nm[x \u0307j , x \u0307k ] + m[xj ,\n\ndf\ndx \u0307k\n] = im\u03b8jk ,\ndt\ndt\n\nor equivalently\nm[x \u0307j , x \u0307k ] + [xj , Fk ] = im\u03b8jk\n\n10\n\ndf\n.\ndt\n\n(54)\n\n(55)\n\n\fSince the Moyal bracket is also bilinear we can write\n[xl , [xj , Fk ]] = \u2212m[xl , [x \u0307j , x \u0307k ]] + im\u03b8jk [xl ,\n\ndf\n].\ndt\n\n(56)\n\nFurthermore, using the Jacobi identity of xl , x \u0307j and x \u0307k , the first term in the right\nside of equation (56) gives\n[xl , [x \u0307j , x \u0307k ]] = i[(\u03b8lk x \u0307j \u2212 \u03b8lj x \u0307k ), f ]\n\n(57)\n\nand we can write\n[xl , [xj , Fk ]] = \u2212im[(\u03b8lk x \u0307j \u2212 \u03b8lj x \u0307k ), f ] + im\u03b8jk [xl ,\n\ndf\n].\ndt\n\n(58)\n\nNote that, in spite of the fact that (55) extends the standard relation (15) it preserves\nthe antisymmetry property of xj and Fk , because of the antisymmetry of the NC\nparameter \u03b8, namely\n[xj , Fk ] = \u2212[xk , Fj ],\n(59)\nand therefore the field B can also be defined as\n[xj , Fk ] = \u2212(ih\u0304/m)\u01ebjkl Bl .\n\n(60)\n\nEquations (58) and (60) give the following Moyal bracket\n!\n\ndf\nm2\n\u01ebjks [(\u03b8lk x \u0307j \u2212 \u03b8lj x \u0307k ), f ] \u2212 \u03b8jk [xl , ] ,\n[xl , Bs ] =\n2h\u0304\ndt\n\n(61)\n\nwhich vanishes for \u03b8 = 0, giving rise then to the standard Poisson bracket (20).\nThe field B can be written using (55)and (60) as follows\nBs = \u2212i\n\nm2\nm2\ndf\n\u01ebjks [x \u0307j , x \u0307k ] \u2212\n\u01ebjks \u03b8jk .\n2h\u0304\n2h\u0304\ndt\n\n(62)\n\nNote that the second term in the right hand side of (62) didn't appear in standard\ncalculations (22). On the other hand, using (60) as well as the expression of the\nLorentz force (10) we can write for the electric field E\n[xj , Ek ] = \u2212\u01ebkmn x \u0307m [xj , Bn ] \u2212 i\u01ebkmn \u03b8jm f Bn ,\n\n(63)\n\nTo explicit much more this expression one need only to substitute the bracket [xj , Bn ]\nand Bn by their explicit formulas (61-62). Now, in order to obtain the NC analogous\nof the first Maxwell equation divB = 0, one should compute, as previously, the Moyal\nbracket between the velocity and the field B\n[x \u0307s , Bs ] = \u2212i\n\nm2\ndf\nm2\n\u01ebjks [x \u0307s , [x \u0307j , x \u0307k ]] \u2212\n\u01ebjks \u03b8jk [x \u0307s , ],\n2h\u0304\n2h\u0304\ndt\n\n(64)\n\nor simply\n[Bs , x \u0307s ] =\n11\n\ndf\nm2\n\u01ebjks \u03b8jk [x \u0307s , ],\n2h\u0304\ndt\n\n(65)\n\n\fsince the first term of (64) vanishes using the analogous of the Jacobi identity(23).\nAfterwards, using (37), this equation becomes\n(ih\u0304\u03b4as + im\u03b8as f )\n\n\u2202Bs\nm3\ndf\n=\n\u01ebjks \u03b8jk [x \u0307s , ],\n\u2202xa\n2h\u0304\ndt\n\n(66)\n\nor equivalently\ndf\n\u2202Bs\nm3\nm\n\u2202Bs\n= \u2212i 2 \u01ebjks \u03b8jk [x \u0307s , ] \u2212 \u03b8as f\n.\n\u2202xs\ndt\nh\u0304\n\u2202xa\n2h\u0304\nUsing once again (61) and the following identity\n[Bs , xs ] = [xa , xs ]\n\n\u2202Bs\n\u2202Bs\n= i\u03b8as\n,\n\u2202xa\n\u2202xa\n\n(67)\n\n(68)\n\nthe first NC Maxwell equation corresponding to (51) reads finally as\nm3\n\u2202Bs\ndf\n= \u2212i 2 \u01ebjks \u03b8jk [(x \u0307s + 2xs ), ]\n\u2202xs\ndt\n2h\u0304\n3\nm\n+ i 2 \u01ebjks [(\u03b8ks x \u0307j \u2212 \u03b8sj x \u0307k ), f ].\nh\u0304\n\ndiv\u03b8 B =\n\n(69)\n\nThis equation can be simply rewritten as\ndiv\u03b8 B = \u03b7\u03b8 ,\n\n(70)\n\ns\nfor the first NC Maxwell equawhere we have introduced the notation div\u03b8 B \u2261 \u2202B\n\u2202xs\ntion to distinguish it from the standard case. A remarkable fact is that the r.h.s. of\n(69) namely \u03b7\u03b8 , is completely dependent of the NC parameter \u03b8, setting \u03b8 = 0 we\nobtain exactly the ordinary Maxwell equation (24). Here, one could anticipate and\ngive a significance to this new immersing term \u03b7\u03b8 as being a density of magnetic\ncharges in analogy with the density of electric charge.\nNext, to obtain the second NC Maxwell equation, we derive with respect to time\nthe field Bs (62)\n\n\u2202Bs\nm2\n\u2202Bs\ndx \u0307j\nm2\nd2 f\n= \u2212i \u01ebjks [\n+ x \u0307m\n, x \u0307k ] \u2212\n\u01ebjks \u03b8jk 2 ,\n(71)\n\u2202t\n\u2202xm\nh\u0304\ndt\n2h\u0304\ndt\nthis is because the magnetic field B is (x, t)-coordinates dependent, since the velocity\nis also considered as depending on the space coordinate.

Our last forthcoming section\nis devoted to a conclusion with a discussion about the derived results.\n\n4\n\nConcluding Remarks.\n\nLet us summarize what has been the scope of this work. The importance of the\nso called Feynman's proof of the Maxwell equations was essentially revealed by the\nDyson's work [15]. This paper resuscitated a former idea of Feynman who made\na proof of the Maxwell equations assuming only the Newton's law of motion and\nthe commutation relations between position and velocity. This proof that Feynman\nrefused to publish, believing that it was a simple joke [21], was appreciated and\ntaken with a great seriousness by several scientists [16-19].\nHowever, one of the things that caused some discussions around the Feynman's\nproof is the fact that the derivation mixes classical and quantum concepts and the\nsmall confusion that seems to appear when we see the relativistic Maxwell equations\nderived from the classical Newton's law. The point is that the consideration of non\nrelativistic equations and the relations of commutation between position and velocity are only a process well arranged to get the Maxwell equations. As it is signaled\nin [18], one may wonder then how truly relativistic Maxwell equations are derived\nfrom Newton's classical assumptions?. The confusion could be shaped if we remark\nthat the Feynman's proof concerns only half of Maxwell equations, namely divB = 0\n13\n\n\f+ \u2207 \u00d7 E = 0, describing the Bianchi set of equations. It doesn't anymore\nand \u2202B\n\u2202t\npose problem since this couple of equations is compatible with the nonrelativistic\nGalilean invariance.\nFollowing the Feynman's proof of the Maxwell equations, assuming only the Newton's law of motion and the commutation relation between position and velocity, we\ntry in this paper to study this proof using the NC geometry framework. To accomplish this task, we consider two kinds of NC formulations going along the same way\nas Feynman's approach. This allows us to discover, in a first formulation, the static\nMaxwell equations. Afterwards, motivated by the hope to find a new theory using\nNC framework, we assume that the velocity is also space dependent and write the\nmodified NC relation (51). The results extracted from the second formulation are\nmore significant as they are associated to a non trivial \u03b8-extension of the Bianchi-set\n2\nj\ns\nof Maxwell equations namely div\u03b8 B = \u03b7\u03b8 and \u2202B\n+ \u01ebkjs \u2202E\n= A1 ddt2f + A2 df\n+ A3 ,\n\u2202t\n\u2202xk\ndt\nwhere A1 , A2 and A3 are local coefficient functions depending on the NC parameter\n\u03b8. Our objectives in reconsidering the Feynman's proof are, on one hand, to put it\nin relief and, on the other hand, to show its importance in the NC framework.\nThe novelty of this proof in the NC space is revealed notably at the level of\nthe corrections brought to the previous Maxwell equations. These corrections correspond essentially to the possibility of existence of sources of magnetic charges that\nwe can associate to the magnetic monopole since div\u03b8 B = \u03b7\u03b8 . Note that these extra\nterms \u03b7\u03b8 are absent in the ordinary case associated to \u03b8 = 0. These results may give\nnew insights into the study of the electromagnetic duality and its various physical\nand mathematical aspects.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical\nPhysics, Trieste-Italy, and the considerable help of the High Energy Section where\nthis work was done.
