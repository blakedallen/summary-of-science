INTRODUCTION\n\nInterest in the matter distributions of 208 Pb, and its neutron density profile particularly,\nis quite topical [1]. There is a proposal to measure its neutron root-mean-square (rms) radius\nat the Jefferson Laboratory [2] from an analysis of parity-violating electron scattering data.\nIn contrast to proton rms radii that are known to within an accuracy \u223c 0.02 fm [3], neutron\nrms radii are less certain.\nRecently, the neutron rms radius in 208 Pb was assessed in terms of modern SkyrmeHartree-Fock (SHF) models [1]. With the Friedman-Pandharipande (FP) neutron equation\nof state [4] as a constraint, the neutron rms radius in 208 Pb was expected to be 0.16\u00b10.02\nr fm\n\nlarger than the proton value. Previous estimates of this neutron skin, S =\n\nq\n\nhrn2 i \u2212\n\nD\n\nE\n\nrp2 ,\n\nranged from 0.1 fm to 0.3 fm [2,5]; the lower values favored in general by SHF models, while\nrelativistic mean field models predict values closer to 0.3 fm [6]. Knowledge of the skin\nthickness in 208 Pb then is a good constraint upon such models of structure [6].\nThe planned parity-violating electron scattering experiment [2] will only provide information about the neutron rms radius itself. We seek further information and address the\nquestion of whether analyses of nucleon scattering data establish a measure of the neutron\ndensity distribution in 208 Pb. Hadron scattering data have been analyzed previously to deduce the neutron skin thickness in 208 Pb. The ratio of \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 reaction cross sections gave\nS = 0.0\u00b10.1 fm [7]. Analyses of elastic proton scattering data at 0.8 GeV gave 0.14\u00b10.04 fm\n[8]. However, a review of the analysis of proton scattering from 40 Ca [9] gave values in the\nrange of \u22120.4 fm to \u22120.2 fm for S in that nucleus which are systematically smaller than all\ntheoretical models which give \u22120.05 fm [10], and suggests that there is a systematic problem\nin the analysis using phenomenological models of high energy proton scattering data which\nwould affect the extracted S values at the level of \u223c 0.2 fm. A more recent analysis of\n650 MeV proton scattering data [11] gave S = 0.20 \u00b1 0.04 fm for 208 Pb while that reaction\nmodel gave a result for 40 Ca which is consistent with theoretical predictions. The excitation\nof the isovector giant dipole resonance in 208 Pb by inelastic alpha scattering [12] was used\nto deduce S = 0.19 \u00b1 0.09 fm. These previous analyses, based on phenomenological models,\nproduce a range of results for 208 Pb and suggest that there may be small but systematic\nerrors in those strong interaction models for hadron scattering limiting the accuracy in the\nextraction of S to \u223c 0.2 fm.\nOur approach is based on coordinate space nonlocal optical potentials generated by a\nfull folding of realistic effective nucleon-nucleon (NN) interactions with ground state density\nmatrices (termed densities hereafter) of 208 Pb. This allows us to distinguish between various\nmodel structures, including those of the SHF type proposed by Brown [1], even if two may\nhave the same rms radii. As a calibration of the use of SHF models we consider the elastic\nscattering from 40 Ca as well. Further, as the effective NN interaction is dominated by the\nisoscalar 3 S1 channel [13], proton scattering predominantly will probe the neutron density\nand vice-versa and so we consider both proton and neutron elastic scattering at a given\nenergy seeking as complete a map as possible of the nuclear matter distributions.\n\n2\n\n\fII. NUCLEAR MODELS AND THE MICROSCOPIC OPTICAL POTENTIAL\n\nThe model with which predictions of nucleon-nucleus (NA) scattering observables are\nmade has been given in detail in a recent review [13]. Use of the complex, nonlocal, NA\noptical potentials defined by that model prescription, without localization of the exchange\namplitudes, gave predictions of differential cross sections and spin observables that are in\ngood agreement with data from many nuclei (3 He to 238 U) and for a wide range of energies\n(40 to 300 MeV). Crucial to that success was the use of effective NN interactions built upon\nNN g matrices; solutions of Brueckner-Bethe-Goldstone equations for realistic starting (free)\nNN interactions. The NA optical potentials result from folding those effective interactions\nwith the densities of the target nucleus. That folding includes the antisymmetrization of the\nprojectile-nucleus wave functions and therefore exchange (knock-out) amplitudes are treated\nexplicitly. Consequently the NA potentials inherently are non-local. The optical potentials\nthat result from that process we term for brevity as g-folding potentials.\nRecently, this approach was applied successfully to make predictions of the integral observables of nucleon elastic scattering [14]. Thus, the use of the g-folding optical potentials\ngive good predictions to both angular-dependent and integral observables; a result not guaranteed with the more common phenomenological approaches. Of import, however, is that\nthe level of agreement with data in the g-folding model depends on the quality of the underlying model of structure. We seek to use that dependence as a sensitive evaluation of the\ndensities considered.\nOur theoretical density distributions are based upon the Skyrme Hartree-Fock model\nfor 208 Pb with a spherical closed-shell configuration. It was shown in [1] that there is\na combination of parameters in the Skyrme Hamiltonian (dominated by the x3 parameter)\nwhich has a strong influence on the neutron skin thickness but which are not well determined\nby the data on binding energies and charge radii. This combination can be correlated with\nthe pressure in the neutron equation of state at normal nuclear density [1]. It can also be\nrelated to the surface symmetry energy [10]. The Skyrme interaction SKX [15] was obtained\nwith a constraint on the neutron equation of state provided by the FP model [4] which\nconstrains the neutron skin in 208 Pb to be S = 0.16 \u00b1 0.02 fm. The results obtained with\nthe SKX model will be denoted herein by SHF1. If one does not allow for any constraint\nfrom a model for the neutron equation of state then a much larger range of S is allowed. In\nparticular, we use a model which is constrained by the same nuclear properties used for SKX\nbut with a value of the parameters which gives S = 0.25 fm for 208 Pb. This we denote as\nSHF2. The densities for 208 Pb obtained from these models, as well as the others considered\nherein, are shown in Fig. 1.\nAn initial test of these interactions is provided by the elastic electron scattering data\nwhich yields information on the charge density which, in turn, gives information on the\nproton density. SKX appears to give an excellent reproduction of the charge-density distribution (Fig. 11 of [15]). However, there is some model dependence in the extraction of\nthe charge density from electron scattering data. It is better to compare to a representation\nwhich is more closely associated with the actual data \u2013 this is the plane-wave transform of\nthe charge density shown in Fig. 2. The experimental form factor is obtained from the charge\ndensity distribution given in [3]. Experiment is compared with the SHF1 and SHF2 model\nresults showing a disagreement with data which systematically increases with momentum\n3\n\n\ftransfer. The main feature of the distribution which affects the high-q behavior is the surface thickness. As discussed in [15], the SKX interaction appears to have a surface thickness\nwhich is a little sharper than that determined from experiment. We have thus looked at\nother Skyrme interactions in terms of the data in Fig. 2 and find the older SKM* interaction\n[16] is much better than others in this regard. SKM* appears to achieve this improvement\nby a decrease in the power of the density, \u03c1\u03b1 , associated with the density-dependent part\nof the interaction from its value \u03b1 = 1/2 for SKX to \u03b1 = 1/6 for SKM*. Coincidentally,\nSKM* predicts a neutron skin of 0.17 fm which is essentially the same as that predicted by\nSKX (SHF1 model). This is obtained mainly because the x3 parameter was set to zero by\ndefault, since it is not well determined by nuclear data.\nThe value of \u03b1 is also associated with the incompressibility coefficient K for infinite\nnuclear matter which ranges from K = 270 MeV for SKX to K = 217 MeV for SKM*. It\nwas found in [15] that \u03b1 = 1/2 gave the best overall fit with the data set considered and\nthat when \u03b1 is decreased (as in the SKXm interaction, which has \u03b1 = 1/3) the overall \u03c72\nincreased mainly because of an increase in the contribution from the single-particle energies.\nIt was also argued in [15] that an improvement in the surface properties may require an\nadditional parameter in the Skyrme Hamiltonian associated with the next order d-wave\nterm in the expansion in terms of the range of the NN interaction. Thus the present models\nare not perfect but they are good enough for a discussion of the effects of the neutron skin\nand the surface thickness on the proton and neutron scattering data. We compare results\nobtained with three Skyrme interactions SHF1 (SKX), SHF2, and SKM* which will enable\nus to explore the effect of neutron skin (a comparison of SHF1 and SHF2) with a fixed\nsurface thickness, and surface thickness (a comparison of SHF1 and SKM*) with a fixed\nneutron skin.\nWe compare also with results obtained with the simple harmonic-oscillator radial wave\nfunctions for 208 Pb which were used in [13]. Two sets of oscillator parameters were used.\nFor HO1 we use h\u0304\u03c9 = 6.70 MeV for both protons and neutrons which is chosen to give the\nrms charge radius of 5.50 fm (a proton rms radius 5.45 fm). HO1 has a neutron rms radius\nof 5.84 fm. For HO2 the oscillator parameter for neutrons was changed to 7.25 MeV to\ndecrease the rms neutron radius to 5.61 fm so that the neutron skin S = 0.16 fm is close to\nthat obtained with SHF1 and SKM*.\nThe rms radii from all models of the ground state of 208 Pb considered are listed in Table I.\nAll five give essentially the same radius for the protons but they vary considerably in the\nradius for the neutrons. The difference between the neutron and proton rms radii given in\nthe last column emphasizes that spread. Note that the HO2 model was chosen to give the\nsame rms radii as those of the SHF1 model. The neutron radius obtained from the SKM*\nmodel is similar to those of the SHF1 and HO2 models. However, as is evident in Fig. 1,\neach model gives distinctive density distributions. The normalization used is such that their\nvolume integrals equate to the proton and neutron numbers of 82 and 126 respectively. In\nFig. 1, the proton density \u03c1p (r) of both the SHF1 and SHF2 models are displayed by the\nsolid curve. The density obtained from the SKM* model is given by the double-dot-dashed\nline and exhibits a larger diffuseness compared to the densities of the other Skyrme models.\nLikewise, both the HO1 and HO2 models have proton densities as given by the dot-dashed\ncurve. These quite distinct shapes nevertheless give the same proton rms radius. However,\nthey differ in the longitudinal electron scattering form factor as shown in Fig. 2.\n4\n\n\fThe five model neutron densities \u03c1n (r) are also shown in Fig. 1. The SHF1 and SHF2\nneutron densities are displayed by the solid and dashed lines respectively. They are similar\nwith the SHF2 density having a slightly more diffuse surface region; a property that results\nin the larger neutron rms radius. The density from the SKM* model is given by the doubledot-dashed line and, as for the proton density, exhibits a larger diffuseness compared to\nthe densities of the other Skyrme models. The neutron densities of the HO1 and HO2\nmodels are displayed by the dotted and dot-dashed lines respectively. As with their proton\ndensities, the neutron densities of both of these models are enhanced in the nuclear interior\nover the SHF values. But these HO densities also have increased neutron probability at the\nsurface. Recall that the HO2 model was set to have the same neutron rms radius as the\nSHF1 prescription.\nThe SHF (SKX) densities for 40 Ca are displayed in Fig. 3. Also displayed therein are\nthe densities from the oscillator model used by Karataglidis and Chadwick [17], for which\nh\u0304\u03c9 = 10.25 MeV. In the surface region, the two models predict essentially the same densities.\nAs those densities differ markedly only well within the nuclear volume, we expect influence\non scattering primarily at high momentum transfer scattering results at energies for which\nabsorption through the nucleus is not too large. We anticipate differences in cross sections\nfor scattering at energies \u2265 200 MeV and at momentum transfer values \u2265 1 fm\u22121 .\nIII. RESULTS\n\nWe have analyzed both proton and (where available) neutron elastic scattering data\nfrom 40 Ca and 208 Pb at 40, 65, and 200 MeV. The choices of energies were predicated in\npart on the availability of data and of the momentum transfer values at which those data\nhave been measured. In addition our choice was influenced by previous applications of the gfolding potentials with those energies being quite successful [13]. Furthermore, the effective\ninteractions defined for each energy are quite different due to the energy dependence of\nmedium effects in the basic g matrices so that the set of NA scattering results we obtain\nprovide a consistency check on the various models of structure used.\nThe differential cross sections for 40 MeV proton and neutron elastic scattering from\n40\nCa are presented in Fig. 4. Therein, the proton scattering data of Camis et al. [18] and the\nneutron scattering data of de Vito et al. [19] are compared to the results of the calculations\nmade using SHF (solid line) and HO (dashed line) models. The SHF and HO model results\nequally well describe the data, although they underpredict the proton scattering in the\nregions of the minima. That disagreement may be due to problems in specifying the effective\ninteraction at low energies [20]. However, further comment should await the consideration\nof the comparisons of 40 MeV proton scattering from 208 Pb. Whatever any deficiency at\nthis energy there may be though does not affect results we find for, and conclusions we may\ndraw from, scattering at 65 and 200 MeV.\nThe 65 MeV elastic scattering scattering cross sections for 40 Ca are displayed in Fig. 5.\nTherein, the agreement between the model results and the proton scattering data of Sakaguchi et al. [21] is now very good; much better than that found in Fig. 4. Also, there is a\nslight preference for the SHF result at larger angles. In the case of the neutron scattering\nresults, both model results agree but underpredict some of the data of Hjort et al. [22].\nHowever, those data are somewhat problematic as concluded from a recent analysis [17] in\n5\n\n\fwhich several sets of data were compared with theory at that energy. A new measurement\nof this cross section is required to resolve any such problem.\nIt is with 200 MeV scattering from 40 Ca, displayed in Fig. 6, that we observe significant\ndifferences between the predictions of scattering made using the SHF and HO models. For\nproton scattering that is displayed in Fig. 6(a), the SHF model result agrees well with the\ndata of Hutcheon et al. [23] (circles) and Seifert et al. [24] (squares) and is a significant\nimprovement on the result found using the HO model. This variation concurs with our\nexpectation that the differences between the inner radial densities of the two models of\nstructure would influence the results of scattering calculations at higher energies. Taking\nthe results at all three energies, we believe that the SHF model is the better description of\n40\nCa.\nWe now turn to 208 Pb and consider first the integral observables from nucleon scattering\nas a test of sensitivity to the matter distributions of 208 Pb. Those integral observables at\n40, 65, and 200 MeV are given in Tables II and III and we note that a study of these\nquantities with two of these structure models has been made recently [14] for energies 10\nto 300 MeV. The total reaction cross sections for both proton and neutron scattering from\n208\nPb are listed in Table II. Comparing the results of the calculations at both 40 and 65 MeV\nwith the available proton data indicates a preference for both SHF, the SKM*, and HO2\nmodels of the ground state density. However, comparing the model results of the neutron\ntotal reaction cross section with the available evaluated data at those energies [25] gives a\npreference for the Skyrme models only. The predicted proton and neutron total reaction\ncross sections at 200 MeV vary sufficiently that their measurements would be desirable.\nThe results of our calculations for the total neutron cross sections are given for the three\nenergies in Table III and are compared with the data of Finlay et al. [26]. For 40 MeV\nthe Skyrme models are preferred, although all results overestimate the measured value. At\n65 MeV the Skyrme model results agree well with the data, the SKM* model result doing\nbest of all, and do better than both HO predictions. This is not the case at 200 MeV,\nwhere all results predict the measured value reasonably well. While these total reaction and\ntotal cross section results together indicate a preference for the Skyrme models, we need\nadditional evidence. We consider then the angular distributions of each scattering.\nThe differential cross sections for the scattering of 40, 65 and 200 MeV nucleons from\n208\nPb are presented in Figs. 7, 8, and 9 respectively. At 40 MeV, proton elastic scattering is\nshown in Fig. 7 and evidently there is little if any differentiation between the SHF1, SHF2,\nand SKM* model results. They both compare well with the data of Blumberg et al. [27].\nNote, however, that both SHF and the SKM* calculated results agree much better with the\ndata than do those found using the HO models of structure. The quality of reproduction\nof the data in this case is in stark contrast to what we found at 40 MeV with 40 Ca. If\nthat is to remain a problem with specification of the effective interaction then it seems to\nbe a nucleus-dependent effect. In the case of neutron scattering, the results of all model\ncalculations agree quite well with the data of de Vito et al. [19]. The results for 208 Pb are\nmore distinctive than those for 40 Ca at this and other energies, but so are the distinctions\nbetween the model proton densities for both nuclei. However, these results indicate that\nwhile the nucleon densities in 208 Pb are better described by the SHF and SKM* models\nnucleon scattering at this energy is largely sensitive to the surface properties only. Only in\nthe surface are the proton densities still sufficiently similar for neutron scattering results of\n6\n\n\fall models to be as alike as they are.\nRecall that the integral observables given in Table II make preference to the SHF and\nSKM* models of the density. Similar preference is indicated by the differential cross sections\nfor 65 MeV scattering that are displayed in Fig. 8. Considering the neutron scattering first,\nall models give similar results in good agreement with the data of Ibaraki et al. [28], although\nabove 40\u25e6 the SHF and SKM* model results clearly do better. For proton scattering, the\nSHF and SKM* models are both in good agreement with each other and with the data and\ndiffer only slightly from those of the HO models. As for 40 MeV scattering, the integral\nobservables at 65 MeV concur with these findings that favor the Skyrme models of the\ndensity.\nThe differential cross sections for 200 MeV nucleon scattering from 208 Pb are shown in\nFig. 9. In this case only 200 MeV proton scattering data exist [23] for comparison with\nour predictions. Nevertheless, that comparison confirms the findings from analyses of the\nlower energy data, namely that the SHF and SKM* models are the better descriptions of\nthe densities of 208 Pb. In addition, however, some discrimination between the three Skyrme\nmodel results is evident at this energy. Of the three Skyrme models, the SKM* model\nresult agrees best of all with the data while the SHF1 does worst. Given that the rms\nradii from these two models are very similar, the marked difference indicates a sensitivity\nto the diffuseness in the density. At this energy, unlike those at lower energies, the neutron\nscattering results show marked differences between the SHF and HO calculations. Again,\nwe expect that this is due to the scattering of the higher energy probe being more influenced\nby the bulk nuclear medium properties of the densities. Consequently, a measurement of the\n200 MeV neutron elastic scattering, angular distribution and associated integral observables,\nis certainly desirable.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe distinctions between the predictions of nucleon scattering from 208 Pb at these three\nenergies, and found with the set of five model structures used, suffice to select that which\nmost likely prescribes the actual matter densities of the nucleus. A similar conclusion is\nreached for 40 Ca for the models considered herein. Specifically we contend that the use of\ng-folding potential model calculations can differentiate between different model structures\nof the neutron density so as to pin down the neutron rms radius far better than has been\npossible in the past. As well the process gives a good appraisal of the actual density distribution. For 208 Pb in particular, our analyses indicate that the SKM* model gives the best\nrepresentation of the density. Together with analyses of the longitudinal elastic electron\nscattering form factor it suggests a neutron skin thickness for 208 Pb of 0.17 fm; a value\nconsistent with expectations of the SHF1 model nucleus, which is constrained by the FP\nneutron equation of state. The only difference between the two models is that of a larger\ndiffuseness for the SKM* model, accounting for both the agreement between the results and\ndata for both nucleon and electron scattering. This would suggest a need to extend the SKX\nmodels to predict a larger diffuseness, for example, by the addition of a d-wave term in the\nSkyrme Hamiltonian.\nOne should also note that while a measurement of the skin thickness as proposed in the\nexperiment for the Jefferson Laboratory [2] is important, that quantity is a volume property\n7\n\n\fof the nucleon distributions. Other information is required to specify a more complete picture\nof the neutron density. From our studies it seems that simultaneous analyses of angular and\nintegral observables are relevant. Given that the HO2, SHF1, and SKM* models of structure\nwe have used predict essentially the same skin thickness for 208 Pb but give significantly\ndifferent predictions when used to generate NA g folding optical potentials for the nucleon\nscattering, as well as electron scattering form factors, analyses of complementary nucleon\nand electron scattering data permit one to discern such finer details of densities.\nThis work was supported in part by a grant from the Australian Research Council, U.S.\nNational Science Foundation grants no.
