We point out that de Sitter space in arbitrary dimensions arises naturally as\nthe vacuum of this theory. This explicitly shows how de Sitter space can be embedded into elevendimensional supergravity. In addition we discuss the novel way in which this theory avoids various\n'no-go theorems' which assert that de Sitter space is not a consistent vacua of eleven-dimensional\nsupergravity theory. We also point out that the eight-branes of this theory, which couple electrically\nto the ten-form, will typically sweep out de Sitter world-volumes.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nde Sitter space has recently become the focus of much attention (see, for example, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]).\nFrom the observational point of view there is some evidence that there is a non-vanishing cosmological\nconstant. In addition any inflationary scenario requires de Sitter space or some close cousin. From\nthe theoretical point of view de Sitter space has become somewhat of an anomaly because, of all the\nthings you can get out of string theory, de Sitter space doesn't seem to be one of them.\nAlthough little is known about M-theory it has provided us with a remarkable understanding\nof many phenomenon in string theory. In particular M-theory allows us to explore regions beyond\nthe reach of string theory. In this paper we wish to discuss a slight extension of eleven-dimensional\nsupergravity (that still preserves eleven-dimensional supersymmetry). Furthermore it is natural to\nassume that this extension reflects an underlying, modified (or massive) M-theory which we call MMtheory. The main focus here will be to show that de Sitter space is the natural ground state of\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nemail: chamblin@mit.edu\nemail: lambert@mth.kcl.ac.uk\n\n1\n\n\fMM-theory, contrary to the case in standard M-theory and string theory. We also discuss how various\nno-go theorems are avoided.\nde Sitter space has been obtained from supergravity by other methods [6, 7], which involve reducing\non noncompact internal spaces or supergravities with negative norm fields. Here we wish to discuss\nanother mechanism that is intriguingly related to standard M-theory. Indeed it suggests that the\nstandard M-theory moduli space should be extended. However, even if the discussion presented here\nturns out to have no relation to M-theory or string theory, it nevertheless provides a natural embedding\nof de Sitter space into eleven-dimensional supergravity.\n\n2\n\nMM-theory\n\nIn [9] it was observed that the equations of motion of eleven-dimensional supergravity [8] admit a slight\nmodification. Rather than using the standard spin connection D it is possible to include a conformal\nspin connection D\u0302 \u223c D + 2k, provided that the conformal part of the curvature vanishes, i.e. dk = 0.\nIn simply connected spacetimes this implies that k is exact and the modification is simply a field\nredefinition. In particular, if k = d\u03b8 then the redefinition that takes the equations of motion defined\nwith the connection D\u0302 back to the usual ones is\nN\n\neM\n\n\u03c8M\n\nN\n\n\u2192 e\u22122\u03b8 eM\n\n\u2192 e\u22122\u03b8 \u03c8M ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere M, N = 0, ..., 10. However if the spacetime is non-simply connected then this modification is\nnon-trivial [10].\nAt present the underlying principles behind M-theory are unclear. Most of what we understand is\nbased on the principle that M-theory has eleven-dimensional supersymmetry and by compactification\non a circle it can be related to type IIA string theory. From this point of view there is no reason not to\nconsider the most general set of equations with this property. To lowest order in a derivative expansion\nthese equation are just those of [9]. Thus we introduce the notion of modified (or massive) M-theory\nor MM-theory, which includes the conformal spin connection.\nThe simplest example of a non-simply connected manifold, on which we may compactify MMtheory, is M10 \u00d7 S 1 . One can then choose k = mdy, where dy is the tangent vector to the circle. The\nresulting ten-dimensional supergravity was constructed in [10] by the usual ansatz that none of the\nfields depend on the coordinate y. If we turn off the four-form field strength and Fermions then the\nequations of motion of the compactified theory are, in ten dimensions,\n1\nRab \u2212 gab R = \u22122(Da Db \u03c6 \u2212 gab D 2 \u03c6 + gab (D\u03c6)2 )\n2\n1\n1\n+ (F ac Fb c \u2212 gab F 2 )e2\u03c6 \u2212 18m(D(a Ab) \u2212 gab D c Ac )\n2\n4\n2\n\u221236m (Aa Ab + 4gab A2 ) \u2212 12mA(a \u2202b) \u03c6\n\u221230mgab Ac \u2202c \u03c6 \u2212 144m2 gab e\u22122\u03c6\n\nD b Fab = 18mAb Fa b + 72m2 e\u22122\u03c6 Aa \u2212 24me\u22122\u03c6 \u2202a \u03c6\n3\n6D 2 \u03c6 \u2212 8(D\u03c6)2 = \u2212R + e2\u03c6 F 2 + 360m2 e\u22122\u03c6 + 288m2 A2 + 96mAb \u2202b \u03c6 \u2212 36mD b Ab\n4\n2\n\n(2.2)\n(2.3)\n(2.4)\n\n\fwhere Fab is the R-R sector vector and Fab = \u2202a Ab \u2212 \u2202b Aa as usual. Note that we have also changed\nthe convention for the Ricci curvature from that used in [10] to agree with the standard literature and\nhave corrected some miss-prints.\nThe equations of motion 2.2,2.3 and 2.4 are certainly rather odd and cannot be obtained from\nan action [10]. We also note here that these equations of motion are just the eleven-dimensional\nequations but written in a manner that only ten-dimensional Poincare symmetry is manifest (and with\nno dependence on y), i.e any solution of these equations is a solution of the MM-theory equations of\nmotion. Only in the case m = 0 does one recover the standard massless type IIA supergravity and the\nrelation of M-theory to perturbative string theory. Finally we note naively the vector field Aa has a\ntachyonic mass. However the complicated form of the equations, and the lack of an action formulation\n(and probably any suitable notion of energy) suggests that this is not as problematic as it may at first\nseem. This is further supported by the fact locally these equations of motion are the same as those of\nordinary M-theory. Nevertheless it is compelling to assume that MM-theory (i.e. m 6= 0) is a sector of\nM-theory that should be seriously considered.\nThe same equations of motion can also be obtained through a sort of 'Scherk-Schwarz' dimensional\nreduction of eleven dimensional supergravity over a noncompact dimension [11]. These authors also\ninclude the four-form and hence give the complete equations of motion. One can see that the vector\nAa has become massive by eating the scalar \u03c6. In addition the four-form becomes massive by eating\nthe three-form. While the construction presented in [11] is certainly very interesting, we would like to\nemphasize that it is distinct from the derivation of this massive IIA supergravity presented in [10]. In\nparticular, in [11] there is no Weyl connection, and the theory is obtained by reducing ordinary Mtheory on a noncompact direction. More precisely, one may foliate eleven-dimensional Minkowski space\nwith ten-dimensional de Sitter hyperboloids, and in the 'generalized' dimensional reduction of [11] one\nreduces along the direction orthogonal to the hyperboloids. Presumably, any attempt to compactify the\ndirection transverse to the de Sitter hyperboloids will lead to some metric discontinuity. On the other\nhand, in [10] the theory is obtained by first introducing a non-trivial Weyl connection, as described\nabove, and reducing MM-theory along a smooth circle. It would be interesting to better understand\nhow these two constructions are related.\n\n3\n\nde Sitter space\n\nIf we turn off all the gauge potentials, it is straightforward to show that the only remaining equation\nis the Einstein equation:\nRab = 36m2 e\u22122\u03c6 gab\n(3.1)\ntogether with the \"Maxwell\" and \"scalar\" equations 2.3,2.4, which simply imply that the dilaton \u03c6 is a\nconstant. Thus, if we turn off all of the fields in this theory except gravity, we recover ten-dimensional\nde Sitter space. The effective cosomological constant is then given explictly in terms of the mass and\nscalar vev as\n\u039b = 576m2 e\u22122\u03c6 ,\n(3.2)\nIt is of interest to further compactify this theory to four-dimensions. A first attempt might be\nto employ a sort of Freund-Rubin compactification that is familiar in the AdS cases. However an\nexamination of the equations of motion found in [11] soon shows that there are no four-dimensional\ncompactifications that are Poincare invariant unless the four-form and three-form vanish. This is\neffectively because the four-form has eaten the three-form to become massive. Therefore it is no longer\npossible to set the three form to zero without also setting the four-form to zero.\nOn the other hand, since we already have a positive cosmological constant in ten dimensions, it is\nnot necessary to include additional fields to induce one. Indeed, if we consider the simplest vacuum\n3\n\n\ften-dimensional equation 3.1, corresponding to a constant \u03c6 with all other fields vanishing, then we\nmay solve it by compactifying on any (10 \u2212 D)-dimensional manifold M with the ansatz\n\u0012\n\u0013\ng\u03bc\u03bd 0\ngab =\n,\n(3.3)\n0 gij\nwhere \u03bc, \u03bd = 0, ..., D \u2212 1 and i, j = 1, .., 10 \u2212 D. The equations of motion now slit into two independent\n(D)\n(10\u2212D)\nconditions: Rij = 36m2 e\u22122\u03c6 gij and R\u03bc\u03bd\n= 36m2 e\u22122\u03c6 g\u03bc\u03bd , i.e. the internal space has constant\nscalar curvature R(10\u2212D) = 36(10 \u2212 D)m2 e\u22122\u03c6 and the spacetime has constant curvature R(D) =\n36Dm2 e\u22122\u03c6 . Thus in particular the direct product of D-dimensional de Sitter space with a (10 \u2212 D)dimensional sphere is a solution to the equations of motion.\nWe may lift these solutions to eleven dimensions following the compactification ansatz used in [10].\nIn this case the four-form vanishes and the metric is\nds211 = e\u22122\u03c6/3 ds2dS + e\u22122\u03c6/3 ds2S (10\u2212D) + e4\u03c6/3 dy 2 ,\n\n(3.4)\n\nwhere \u03c6 is constant, ds2dS is the D-dimensional de Sitter metric, ds2S (10\u2212D) the (10 \u2212 D)-dimensional\nsphere metric and y is a compact coordinate around S 1 . In other words dSD \u00d7 S (10\u2212D) \u00d7 S 1 is a\nsolution to MM-theory for any D. In the limit that m \u2192 0 we simply recover flat eleven-dimensional\nMinkowski space with a single compact direction. On the other hand we could keep m 6= 0 and\ndecompactify the S 1 . This does not lead to a solution of ordinary eleven-dimensional supergravity.\nHowever by performing the field redefinition 2.1 (i.e. rescaling the metric by e\u22124my ) we obtain flat\neleven-dimensional Minkowski space constructed as a foliation by ten-dimensional de Sitter spaces [11],\nwhich certainly is a solution of M-theory. Note that now we may no longer compactify the y dimension\nwithout introducing singularities. Thus M-theory and MM-theory are physically distinct.\n\n4\n\nNo no-go theorems\n\nIt has been strongly argued that that de Sitter space cannot be embedded into eleven-dimensional\nsupergravity [12, 3, 5]. In the case presented here the no-go theorem of [12] does not apply because it\nassumes an action formulation in uncompactified eleven dimenions. The theorem of [3] also does not\napply since it assumes that the starting point is the standard (k = 0) eleven-dimensional supergravity\n[8]. There have also been doubts raised as to whether or not de Sitter space could ever arise from string\ntheory or M-theory [5]. It has long been known that there is no de Sitter superalegbra (at least not\nacting on a Hilbert space). Therefore one should never find a supersymmetric de Sitter space solution.\nFurthermore, since there is no notion of positive energy in de Sitter space, one might wonder how it it\ncould arise as a smooth solution to a supersymmetric theory where one expects that the supercharges\nguarantee that all physical states have positive energy. These concerns do seem to apply to MM-theory.\nEven though the equations of motion 2.2,2.3 and 2.4 are, by construction, supersymmetric, the fact\nthat there is no action means that Noether's theorem can not be directly applied. Thus it is perfectly\nconsistent that there is no conserved supercharge, even though the equations of motion are invariant\nunder a continuous symmetry group.\nThis kind of obstruction is not uncommon. For example something rather similar occurs in N = 2\ngauge theories, such as the Seiberg-Witten effective action. In this case the equations of motion are\ninvariant under SL(2, R) modular transformations that rotate a and aD , F\u03bc\u03bd and \u22c6F\u03bc\u03bd , i.e S-duality.\nHowever one does not expect that there is a \"modular\" charge because the action (which exists in this\ncase) is not invariant under the modular group.\nWe expect something similar to occur here. Indeed in the construction of the theory the covariance\nof the eleven-dimensional equations of motion under Weyl transformations was used. However the\n4\n\n\feleven-dimensional action is certainly not Weyl invariant and there are no \"Weyl\" charges. For m 6= 0\nthe supersymmetries become mixed with the Weyl transformations. Therefore one does not expect\nconserved supercharges to arise since there is no conserved \"Weyl\" charge.\nTo see this in more detail we consider the usual supergravity supercharge obtained as an integral\nover a spacelike hypersurface of the supercurrent (for a recent discussion see [13])\nZ\nZ\n\u01edQ = d\u03a3M S\u01ebM = \u2212i d\u03a3M \u01ed\u0393M N P \u2202N \u03c8P . . . ,\n(4.1)\nwhere M, N = 0, ..., 10 and the ellipsis denotes less important terms. For our purposes it is sufficient to\nconsider the linearised theory where \u01eb and \u0393M are constant and hence \u2202M S\u01ebM = 0 is trivially satisfied.\nLocally the equations of motion of the massive theory of section two differ only by the field redefinition 2.1 from those of M-theory. In this way we find that the linearised supercurrent in MM-theory\nis\n\u0001\n(4.2)\n\u015c\u01ebM = e\u03b1my \u01ed\u0393M N P \u2202N \u03c8P + 2m\u01ed\u0393M yP \u03c8P\n\nand it is easy to see that conservation implies that \u03b1 = 2. However, even though \u2202M \u015c\u01ebM = 0, the\nsupercharge \u01edQ is not conserved since\nZ\n\u2202y \u015c\u01eby dy 6= 0 ,\n(4.3)\ndue to the fact that if y is compact, \u015c\u01ebM is multivalued. Thus MM-theory compactified on S 1 with a\ntopologically non-trivial conformal connection has no globally conserved supercharge.\nFor example one can look for Killing spinors in the dS10 \u00d7 S 1 solution of section three, i.e. spinors\nsatisfying D\u0302M \u01eb = 0. Indeed locally such spinors exist and, in a coordinate system where the metric is\nds211 = \u2212dt2 + e4mt (dx21 + ... + dx29 ) + dy 2 , satisfy \u2202y \u01eb = \u22122m\u01eb and \u03930y \u01eb = \u2212\u01eb. However there are no\nKilling spinors that are globally defined around the S 1 and hence no supercharge.\n\n5\n\nde Sitter space on the world-volume of eight-branes\n\nA D8-brane in IIA string theory couples to the ten-form field strength F10 of the R-R sector. As noted\nby Polchinski [14], this ten-form is not dynamical - it is just a constant field which generates a uniform\nenergy density, or 'cosmological constant'. This cosmological term is proportional to the square of the\nmass term of the massive IIA supergravity theory derived by Romans [15]. In the Romans theory, the\nmass term arises from a Higg's mechanism in which the two-form \"eats\" the vector. In the massive\ntheory of [10] the two-form is eaten by the the three-form and the scalar is eaten by the vector.\nAs described in [17], we may dualise the conformal connection k to a ten-form F(10) using the\neleven-dimensional Hodge star operator. This is analogous to the ten-form formulation of Romans\ntheory in [16]. When we do this we obtain a ten-form F10 which is covariantly constant:\n\u22c611 F10 = k .\n\n(5.1)\n\nWe can then use this ten-form to write down a (truncated) action for the theory, in the sector where\nthe dilaton is constant:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n1 \u22124\u03c6\n1\n\u22122\u03c6\n2\n10 \u221a\n.\n(5.2)\nd x \u2212g e R \u2212 e F10\nS= 2\n2\n2\u03ba10\nNote first of all the factor of e\u22124\u03c6 which appears in front of the 10-form. Thus the ten-form of this\ntheory is not a R-R sector field and consequently the eight-branes are not D-branes. Furthermore, if\n5\n\n\fwe match dimensions in (1.6) we find that the tension (T ) of a brane which couples electrically to F10\nmust scale as\nT \u223c e\u03c6\n(5.3)\n\nThus if we assume that \u03c6 is very large, i.e the M-theory limit of type IIA string theory, then it makes\nsense to think of an eight-brane as a 'domain wall', separating two phases (i.e., separating two bubbles\nof ten-dimensional Schwarzschild-de Sitter space). In [17], the trajectories of these eight-branes were\nworked out; furthermore, it is straightforward to see that the metric induced on the world-volumes of\nthese eight-branes can typically be de Sitter (or de Sitter with a radiation term). Thus, we see that it\nis possible to get de Sitter both 'on the eight-brane' and 'in the bulk' of the theory. Presumably these\nresults also apply to compactifications to lower dimensions.\n\n6\n\nConclusion: Is inflation 'natural' in M-theory?\n\nWe have shown that de Sitter space can be obtained in a straightforward fashion by compactifying\neleven-dimensional supergravity, which is the low-energy limit of 'MM-theory'. As a cosmological theory the supergravity discussed here has other interesting features. For example it is possible to find a\nspacetime that admits half of the thirty-two supersymmetries and describes an inflating universe [10].\nFurthermore this theory leads to the novel suggestion that the universe is the solution to a supersymmetric system, but the lack of the supercharges has prevented us from seeing the supersymmetry, i.e.,\nwithout supercharges it is not clear that there needs to be a bose-fermi degeneracy or any Goldstone\nfermions of broken supersymmetries. However, does this really mean that de Sitter space is a natural\nvacua of string theory?\nIn order to answer this, first note that we have focussed on a particular IIA supergravity theory,\nwhere the three-form has eaten the two-form. Hence there is no field to which F-strings can couple to\nelectrically. In this sense, there are no 'strings' in this theory! Thus, it would seem that this theory\nhas avoided any potential conflict between strings and de Sitter vacua simply because it is not a theory\nof strings. On the other hand, to the best of our knowledge, this theory is a perfectly respectable\ncorner of the M-theory moduli space. We should always remember that p-brane democracy teaches us\nto respect all of the diverse and varied degrees of freedom which we may encounter in M-theory, no\nmatter how bizarre these may seem at first glance.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank Paul Howe, Chris Hull, Andreas Karch, Juan Maldacena, Peter\nWest and Edward Witten for discussions and comments on a previous version of this paper.
