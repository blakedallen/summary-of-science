INTRODUCTION\nThere are several reasons for studying quarkonia in pp and P bP b collisions at CMS. The main interest in quarkonia\nproduced in pp collisions arises from the fact that prompt quarkonium production continues to be puzzling: none\nof the theory models for quarkonium production at hadron colliders explains successfully both polarization and\ndifferential cross section measurements. In fact, the colour-octet mechanism [1], part of the NRQCD approach, has\nbeen able to explain the inclusive quarkonium cross section data at the Tevatron, but predicts a polarization, which\nis in contrast with recent measurements at the Tevatron [2]. The colour singlet model (CSM) has recently been\nrevived [3], but whether it can explain both cross section and polarization data is still uncertain. For reviews on\nquarkonium production see [1]. Thanks to the much higher collision energy and luminosity of the LHC, quarkonia can\nbe probed with transverse momenta much higher than currently studied at the Tevatron, allowing us to discriminate\nbetter between theoretical models.\nFor P bP b collisions in CMS, quarkonia are an excellent observable, both to study the thermodynamical properties\nof the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), as well as to constrain the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the colliding\nnuclei. On the one hand, the higher centre-of-mass energy of the LHC with respect to RHIC will result in a higher\ntemperature of the QGP, allowing us to study not only the suppression of J/\u03c8's, but now also that of \u03a5's. On\nthe other hand, given that quarkonia are produced via gluon-gluon processes, the higher centre-of-mass energy at\nLHC will allow us to probe the gluon density of the nuclei at much lower parton fractional momenta than previously\nstudied.\nCMS can contribute to the study of quarkonia thanks to its excellent capabilities to detect muons from quarkonium\ndecays up to large pseudorapidity (|\u03b7| < 2.5). Given the large yields of quarkonia which will be produced at CMS,\nmany analyses dedicated to quarkonium production are viable already with small integrated luminosity. Quarkonia\nare additionally relevant for CMS in the early phases of LHC running because they are crucial for detector alignment\nand calibration.\nIn this note we describe a feasibility study to measure the J/\u03c8\u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 differential cross section in pp data at\n\u221a\n\u221a\ns=14 TeV. In addition we discuss the performance for observing quarkonia in P bP b collisions at sN N = 5.5 TeV.\n\n2. J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 DIFFERENTIAL CROSS SECTION IN P P COLLISIONS\nThree processes dominate J/\u03c8 hadroproduction: prompt J/\u03c8's produced directly, prompt J/\u03c8's produced indirectly (via decay of excited states), and non-prompt J/\u03c8's from the decay of a B-hadron. CMS proposes the following\nstudy to measure the inclusive, prompt, and non-prompt contributions to the differential cross section.\n1\n\n\f34th International Conference on High Energy Physics, Philadelphia, 2008\n\n2.1. J/\u03c8 reconstruction\nFor this study [4] prompt J/\u03c8 signal events were generated with PYTHIA 6.409, including direct and indirect\nproduction. Non-prompt J/\u03c8 events were obtained by generating minimum bias events with PYTHIA. As background\nevents were considered any other source of muons that, when paired, could accidentally have an invariant mass close\nto that of the J/\u03c8. These muons come mainly from heavy flavoured quark decays and sometimes from a \u03c0 \u00b1 or K \u00b1\ndecay in flight. The amount of background from Drell-Yan events was found to be below 1% with respect to that of\nother background sources.\nJ/\u03c8 events are selected with the dimuon trigger employing fast J/\u03c8 reconstruction with a transverse momentum\nthreshold for both muons of at least 3 GeV/c [5]. J/\u03c8 candidates are then reconstructed by pairing muons with\nopposite charge. The invariant mass of the muon pair is required to be between 2.8 and 3.4 GeV/c2 . The two muons\nare required to come from a common vertex. The dimuon mass spectrum including background and signal is given\nin Fig. 1. About 75000 J/\u03c8's are expected to be reconstructed in 3 pb\u22121 . The mass resolution is about 30 MeV/c2 .\nThe distribution is fitted fit with a double Gaussian for the J/\u03c8 signal and a linear function for background.

The green (light grey), blue (black) and red\n(dark grey) areas are the prompt, non-prompt and background contributions, respectively.\n\nresulting number of fitted events for the signal, divided by the total number of generated events, defines the signal\nJ/\u03c8\nreconstruction efficiency convoluted with acceptance, which depends on pT , \u03b7 J/\u03c8 and on the J/\u03c8 polarization.\nJ/\u03c8\nJ/\u03c8\nBelow pT \u223c 5 GeV/c the reconstruction efficiency vanishes. At pT > 20 GeV/c it is about 60% for unpolarized\nJ/\u03c8. Effects of the polarization are taken into account in the systematic uncertainties.\n\n2.2.

The lxy distribution for prompt and\nnon-prompt J/\u03c8's is shown in Fig. 2 (left). For prompt J/\u03c8's the lxy distribution is given by a resolution function,\nwhile for non-prompt J/\u03c8's a resolution function convoluted with an exponential is used. To determine the fraction\nfB of J/\u03c8's from B-hadron decays, an unbinned maximum-likelihood fit was performed fitting simultaneously the\nJ/\u03c8\ninvariant mass and lifetime distributions. Figure 2 (right) shows an example of a fit for 9 < pT < 10 GeV/c.\n\n2.3. Results\nThe dominant systematic uncertainties are the luminosity and the J/\u03c8-polarization.

QUARKONIUM MEASUREMENTS IN HEAVY-ION COLLISIONS\n\nEvents/0.025 GeV/c2\n\nCMS has also studied the performance for reconstructing quarkonia in a P bP b collision environment [6]. Fig 4\nshows the dimuon mass distributions in the J/\u03c8 (left) and \u03a5 (right) mass regions corresponding to 0.5 nb\u22121 of\nP bP b data. The muon and J/\u03c8 reconstruction performance in P bP b collisions is very similar to that in pp collisions,\nhence the mass resolution for J/\u03c8's and \u03a5(1S) is roughly equal to what is expected in pp collisions. What differs\nis the amount of background as well as the quarkonium yield. Significantly more background is expected from\ncombinatorial background of various muon sources (pion, kaon and heavy-quark decays) which can be removed using\ntechniques such as like-sign subtraction. In 0.5 nb\u22121 of data (about one month of P bP b running) about 180000\nJ/\u03c8's and 25000 \u03a5(1S)'s are expected to be collected. Such a large statistics sample will allow us to compare in\ndetail central and peripheral P bP b collisions and to carry out pT \u2212 and y\u2212differential cross section studies which\nwill contribute to clarify the physics mechanisms behind the production (and destruction) of quarkonium states in\nhigh-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions.\n\u00d7103\n120\n\nJ/\u03c8\n\n100\n80\n\u03c8\n\n'\n\n60\n40\n20\n2\n\nTotal\n\nh-c\nh-h\nh-b\nc-b,c-c,b-b\n2.5\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\nM\u03bc+\u03bc- (GeV/c2)\n\nFigure 4: Dimuon mass distributions measured within |\u03b7| < 2.4 for 0.5 nb\u22121 of P bP b data with dNch /d\u03b7\u03b7=0 =2500 in the\nJ/\u03c8 (left) and \u03a5 (right) mass regions, together with the background.\n\n4.
