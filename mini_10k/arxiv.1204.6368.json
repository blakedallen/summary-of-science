Geometrically structured substrates affects\nvarious properties of graphene [1, 2], and can prevent\nthe crumpling of graphene which occurs for free standing\ngraphene without support [3]. Recently, the modification\nof the properties of graphene on top of a substrate were\ninvestigated. It was found that substrates can induce\ncorrugations, modify the electric conductance and deform\ngraphene [4, 5].\nTomori et al used pillars made of a dielectric material placed on top of a substrate which is then overlayed with graphene to generate non-uniform strain on\na micro-scale [6]. Elastic deformations in graphene creates a pseudo-magnetic field which acts on graphene's\nmassless charge carriers [7\u20139]. The resulting variation\nof the hopping energies can be viewed as an induced\npseudo-magnetic field which enters in the Dirac equation.\nEngineering the right topology of the induced pseudomagnetic field can provide magnetic confinement which\nconfines electrons in specific regions in space [10, 11]. It\nhas been shown theoretically that inhomogeneous magnetic fields are able to confine massless Dirac fermions in\na monolayer graphene sheet [12].\nHere, we investigate several nano-structured substrates\nwith different geometrical deformations. We carried out\nmolecular dynamics simulations at T =300 K to minimize\nthe energy and find the optimum profile of the deposited\ngraphene on top of different nanostructured substrates.\nElongated trench, barrier, bubble, Gaussian bump and\nGaussian depression are considered as examples of nanostructured substrates. The adhesion of the substrate to\nthe deposited graphene can induce a very strong pseudomagnetic field which we found depends on the imposed\nboundary conditions on the graphene sheet. Strong\npseudo-magnetic fields (\u223c 1000 T) are found around the\n\ndeformed regions in graphene. A substrate with: (i) a\nstep, forms two magnetic-barriers around the step with\nopposite sign, (ii) a trench forms two narrow magneticbarriers around the trench boundaries with the same sign\nand one with opposite sign within the trench, and (iii)\na one dimensional barrier forms two pairs of magneticbarriers around the barrier's wall. The magnetic confinement for a Gaussian depression in the substrate looses the\nsix-fold symmetry of the pseudo-magnetic field which is\nnot the case for GE on top of a Gaussian bump.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II the details\nof the atomistic model are presented. In Sec. III we\npresent the strain induced gauge field model. In Sec. IV\nwe present results for the gauge fields and the pseudomagnetic fields, for various nano-structured substrates.\nThe results are summarized in Sec. V.\nII.\n\nATOMISTIC MODEL\n\nIn order to find the optimum configuration of graphene\n(GE) on top of various nanostructured substrates we employed classical atomistic molecular dynamics simulation\n(MD). The second generation of Brenner's bond-order\npotential [13] is employed for carbon-carbon interaction and the van der Waals (vdW) interaction between\nGE and different substrates is modeled by employing the\nLennard-Jones (LJ) potential, i.e.\nu(r) = 4\u01eb[(\u03c3/r)12 \u2212 (\u03c3/r)6 ],\n\n(1)\n\nwhere r is the distance between the two particles, \u01eb\nand \u03c3 are the 'energy parameter ' and the 'length parameter ', respectively. To model the interaction between two different types of atoms such as the carbon\natom (C) and the substrate atom (S), we adjust the\n\u221a\nLJ parameters using the equations \u01ebT =\n\u01ebC \u01eb and\n\u03c3T = (\u03c3C + \u03c3)/2. For carbon we use the parameters\n\u03c3C =3.369 \u00c5 and \u01ebC =2.63 meV. For the substrate atoms\n\n\f2\nwe set \u03c3 =3.5 \u00c5 and \u01eb =10.0 meV, which is typical e.g.\nfor a SiO2 substrate [14]. The simulation is done for a GE\nsheet with dimension lx =19.17 nm and ly =19.67 nm at\nT =300 K. The number of substrate atoms is M =6000.\nIn order to model the substrate, a (100) surface having\na typical lattice parameter l=3 \u00c5 is assumed. The density of sites in the substrate is \u03a3S = l\u22122 . The details\nof the found deformations are reported in our previous\nstudy [15].\nIII.\n\nSTRAIN INDUCED PSEUDO-MAGNETIC\nFIELD\n\nGeneralizing the Dirac equation, which governs the low\nenergy electronics of graphene, to curved surfaces is an\ninteresting development which may model some cosmological problems [8, 9]. The metric of the curved surface\nenters now into the Dirac equation. The origin of the deformations are external stresses which deform graphene\nso that the nearest neighbor distances become non-equal.\nNotice that the external stresses can be induced by the\nsubstrate. The latter results in modified hopping parameters introduced in the tight-binding model which are\nnow a function of the atomic positions t(r) [16]. Assuming small atomic displacements (i.e. u = r\u2032i \u2212 ri < a0\nwhere a0 is the carbon-carbon bond length) and rewriting the Dirac Hamiltonian in the effective mass approximation with nonequal hopping parameters tells us that\nthe strain induces an effective gauge field\n2\u03b2~\nA=\n(uxx \u2212 uyy , \u22122uxy ),\n3a0 e\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b2 (\u223c2-3) is a constant and u\u03b1\u03b2 is the strain tensor\nincluding out of plane displacements [8]. The corresponding pseudo-magnetic field perpendicular to the x\u2212y plane\nis obtained as\nB = \u2202y Ax \u2212 \u2202x Ay .\n\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) The optimum configuration of armchair graphene over a step located at x = 0 with supported\nlongitudinal ends. The colors indicate the size of strain.\n\nbetween the optimized graphene over the deformed substrate and the reference system. This is due to the fact\nthat at finite temperature the free edges of graphene over\nthe substrate can vibrate and deform (due to the substrate\ninduced strain) freely while they will not be deformed\nin the reference system. Therefore the reference system\nwith free boundaries for some of the systems can be very\ndifferent from the optimized graphene over the deformed\nsubstrate at finite temperature, hence the differentiation\nis not well defined. Therefore, in this paper we focused\nwill be on systems with fixed boundaries, which were\nstudied in our previous paper [15], where we have a true\nreference system suitable for numerical differentiations.\nIV.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nIn this study we investigate several different geometries\nfor the substrate which can be realized experimentally.\nFor all studied cases we first obtained the optimum configuration of GE on top of the different nanostructured\nsubstrates using MD simulations (those results were presented in our previous work [15]). Then, for the supported boundary condition, we calculate the corresponding gauge field from which we obtain the pseudo-magnetic\nfield.\n\n(3)\n\nThis is the pseudo-magnetic field which the electron experiences in the K valley. We will find B by making the necessary differentiations numerically for longitudinally supported boundary conditions. Here we are\nmostly interested in the out-of-plane contributions of the\npseudo-magnetic field which mainly appears around the\ndeformed parts of graphene. The other in-plane terms\ncontribute less to the pseudo-magnetic field around the\ndeformed parts, particularly when the system is larger\nthan the size of these deformed parts and is supported\nfrom boundaries. Notice that in order to perform the numerical differentiations (in Eq. (2) and Eq. (3)) one needs\na reference graphene lattice (ri ) in order to compare the\noptimized lattice (r\u2032i ) with the reference system. We used\nthe optimized graphene profile at the given temperature\nover a flat substrate as the reference system. However,\nwhen the boundaries are free there is considerable difference (at the boundaries and for some particular systems)\n\nA.\n\nStep\n\nAn interesting substrate configuration is a step which\nwas recently studied in an experiment to measure the\nelectronic and morphology of deposited graphene [17]\nhS (x, y) = h0 \u03b8(x),\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b8(x) is the Heaviside step function and h0 =1 nm is\nthe height of the step. GE with arm-chair direction is put\non top of the step. In Fig. 1 the optimum configuration\nof GE along the arm-chair direction with longitudinally\nsupported boundary condition is shown when placed over\na sharp step defined by Eq. (4).\nThe induced gauge field as obtained from Eq. (2) is averaged over the y-direction and is shown in Fig. 2(a). All\natoms at the step region are stretched which results in\nconsiderable gauge fields around x \u2248 0.

Both\ngauge and pseudo-magnetic fields are comparable with\nthose found for the substrate with a single step placed in\nthe middle of the GE sheet. The main difference is the\nformation of a zero-magnetic field channel in the region\n|x| < d. The electrons will be trapped in this rectangular channel which can be realized in experiments.

(2). Figure 8(a) shows a vector plot\nof the induced gauge fields where the length of the vectors and the colors denote the absolute value of A. The\ncorresponding magnetic field is depicted in Fig. 8(b). Notice that both the gauge field and the pseudo magnetic\nfield exhibits an approximate six fold symmetry [16, 20].\nBecasue of thermal fluctuations the symmetry is not exact. Notice that there is a little elongation along the supported direction. We will discuss this symmetry in the\nnext section. Notice that the induced magnetic fields are\nlarger than those found for the step, trench and barrier.\n\n\f5\n\ny\nx\n\n(a)\nFIG. 7: (Color online) The optimum configuration of armchair graphene, with two longitudinal ends supported in the\nx \u2212 y plane , on top of a bubble.

[15]).\nThe results of the gauge fields and pseudo magnetic\nfields for a graphene membrane with Gaussian deformation show a clear six fold symmetry [16, 20]. For a Gaussian deformation of the graphene membrane, Eq. (8), using Eq. (2) and Eq. (3) we found\n\n(8)\n\nwhere +h0 (\u2212h0 )(=1 nm) is the height (depth) of the\nGaussian bump (depression) and \u03c1i 2 = x2i + yi2 is the\nradial distance of ith atom and \u03b3 = 1 nm is the variance\nof the Gaussian.\nSince the optimum configuration of supported\ngraphene over the Gaussian bump is similar to the one\nfor a spherical bubble, we will not report them here.

The van der Waals\ninteraction between the substrate and graphene was\nmodeled by a Lennard-Jones potential. We found that\nthe induced magnetic filed for graphene on top of a step\nconsists of two magnetic barriers with different sign,\nwhile for a trench it forms two narrow magnetic barriers\naround the trench boundaries and one with opposite sign\nwithin the trench. The one directional substrate barrier,\nforms two sets of magnetic-barriers around the barrier\nwall. The magnetic filed for the Gaussian depression\nlooses its six-fold symmetry (due to the non-Gaussian\ndeformation of graphene) as compared to GE on top of\nthe Gaussian bump/buble. The strain induced strong\npseudo-magnetic fields. Controlling the pseudo-magnetic\nfield is possible by controlling the substrate pattern and\nthe size of the deformation.\n\nprofile of GE on top of a Gaussian depression [15]. Breaking the radial symmetry of graphene deformation reduces\nthe symmetry in B (see Fig. 9 (b)). This particular symmetry affect also the energy eigne values and corresponding wave functions [16].\nIn Fig. 9(a) the induced gauge fields for GE on top of\na Gaussian depression is shown where the length of the\nvectors and the colors denote the absolute value of A.\nBoth gauge fields and pseudo-magnetic fields are smaller\nthan those found for the supported graphene over the\nbubble and the Gaussian bump. This is a consequence\nof the non-Gaussian profile for the optimum configura-\n\nAcknowledgment.
