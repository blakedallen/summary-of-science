An external pressure field is allowed to act directly on\nthe electronic structure of the system studied via the ground-state minimization of the functional\nE + P Vq , where Vq is the quantum volume enclosed by a charge isosurface. The Hellmann-Feynman\ntheorem applies, and assures that the ionic equations of motion follow an isoenthalpic dynamics. No\npressurizing medium is explicitly required, while coatings of environmental ions or ligands can be\nintroduced if chemically relevant. We apply this novel approach to the study of group-IV nanoparticles during a shock wave, highlighting the significant differences in the plastic or elastic response\nof the diamond cage under load, and their potential use as novel nanostructured impact-absorbing\nmaterials.\n\nThe study of nanoparticles under pressure is rapidly\nacquiring great scientific and technological interest, since\nit allows to explore structural arrangements and phase\ntransitions under different kinetic and thermodynamic\nconditions than those of bulk solids. While experiments\non the compression of nanoparticles have been performed\nfor more than a decade [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], and encompass\nbroad classes of materials [6, 7], computational studies\nhave been hampered by the conceptual difficulty arising\nin applying classical or electronic-structure methods to\nthe study of finite systems under pressure. Extended\nsystems can be studied using variable-cell isoenthalpic\ndynamics [8, 9, 10, 11]; however, these methods do not\ncarry over to the case of finite systems, unless the environment (i.e. the pressurizing medium) is introduced\nexplicitly in the calculations [12, 13, 14]. A full quantummechanical treatment becomes then too costly in all but\nthe smallest cases, due to the large number of atoms or\nmolecules that are needed to reproduce the pressurizing environment; in addition, equilibration of the system\nat a given pressure requires extensive simulations averaging over many collision events. To solve the first of\nthese problems, a mixed quantum-mechanics/molecularmechanics approach has been proposed [12, 13] where\nthe quantum fragment is compressed by a pressurizing\nmedium described by classical force fields.\nIn this Letter we present a novel and general approach\nto this problem, and show how pressure can be applied\nto a finite system without the need to introduce a pressurizing medium. We introduce here, as thermodynamic\nfunctional describing a finite system under pressure, the\nelectronic enthalpy\nH = E + P Vq ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere E is the internal energy of the system, P is the\ndesired pressure and Vq is the \"quantum volume\" occupied by the electronic charge density. This quantity is\nwell defined once the threshold for a density isosurface is\n\nchosen, and can be straightforwardly computed as\nZ\nVq = dr \u03b8(\u03c1(r) \u2212 \u03b1) ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c1(r) is the electronic density and \u03b8 is a step function at the threshold value \u03b1. For computational convenience we smooth the \u03b8 to \u03b8\u0303, defined as the integral of a\nnormalized Gaussian of width \u03c3 = \u03b1/3 [15].\nIn density-functional theory, the total potential acting\non the electrons will be given by the functional derivative\nof the electronic enthalpy in (1) with respect to the charge\ndensity \u03c1(r). This results in an additional contribution\nderiving from the term P Vq which is simply\n\u03a6V (r) = P\n\n2\n2\n\u03b4Vq\nP\n|\u03c1=\u03c1(r) = \u221a e\u2212(\u03c1(r)\u2212\u03b1) /2\u03c3 .\n\u03b4\u03c1\n\u03c3 2\u03c0\n\n(3)\n\nIn the self-consistent solution of the Kohn-Sham equations the \u03a6V potential drives the evolution of the electronic ground-state to the minimum of the electronic enthalpy (1). The Hellmann-Feynman theorem applies,\nand thus the ionic forces take implicitly into account\nthe contribution of the external load, transferring the\neffects of the compression directly to the ionic relaxation\nand dynamics. A Lagrangian formulation (e.g. for firstprinciples Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics [16]) also\nfollows directly.\nThe introduction of an electronic-enthalpy functional\nhas several conceptual and practical advantages: 1) The\npressure field acts directly on the electrons; thus, the\ncompressibility of the system is properly dominated by\nelectrostatic and Pauli-principle effects. Also, if pressure\nwere transferred directly to the ionic nuclei by an external classical force field, electrons could ultimately be\nsqueezed out of the system. 2) Isoenthalpic relaxations\nand dynamics do not require extensive equilibration with\na pressurizing medium; a medium can always be introduced as an environmental coating, if chemically rele-\n\n\f2\n\nInterlayer distance (a.u.)\n\n2.6\n\n2.4\n\n2.2\n\n2\n\n1.8\n0\n\n2.5\n\n2\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n10\n\n30\n\n40\n\n20\n30\nPressure (GPa)\n\n40\n\nFIG. 1: The dependence of the innermost interlayer distance on pressure for a 16-layer silicon slab relaxed using\nthe electronic-enthalpy functional (solid curve); results from\nthe Murnaghan equation of state for a 16-layer bulk supercell (dotted) are shown for comparison. The inset shows the\nresults obtained for a 8-layer slab (solid), a 8-layer supercell\n(dotted), and a 8-layer slab compressed via the explicit introduction of argon as a pressurizing medium (dashed).\n\nvant. 3) In the thermodynamic limit, the classical macroscopic volume and enthalpy are recovered. 4) Implementation in electronic-structure codes is straightforward,\nand can be easily extended to other wavefunction-based\napproaches such as Hartree-Fock or variational quantum\nMonte Carlo. (The results presented here have all been\nobtained using first-principles Car-Parrinello molecular\ndynamics [16], as implemented in the public domain\n\u03bd-ESPRESSO package [17].)\nOther developments and applications stemming from\nthis formulation can be envisioned. A surface tension\nterm H \u2192 H + \u03b3S can be introduced, where the surface\narea is obtained by finite differences via\nZ\n\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2206 | \u2207\u03c1(r)|\n\u2206\n))\u2212 \u03b8\u0303(\u03c1(r)\u2212(\u03b1+ ))]\n2\n2\n\u2206\n(4)\nand \u2206 determines the width of the discretization. This\nlatter contribution to the energy functional could be used\nto characterize surface tension in metallic nanoparticles,\nconfinement effects in electron bubbles (e.g., for electrons\nin superfluid helium [18]) or cavitation effects in solvation models [19]. Finally, we stress that although classical definitions of volume can be introduced in atomistic\nsimulations [20, 21], a natural measure based on the electron density can only emerge in a quantum-mechanical\nformalism. A validation of the present approach can be\nprovided not only in the thermodynamical limit (where\nthe quantum volume Vq becomes indistinguishable from\nthe classical limit), but also for finite, small systems. For\nthis purpose we studied the effect of pressure on thin silicon slabs. This reference system allows for a direct comparison with bulk results without introducing additional\nS =\n\ndr [\u03b8\u0303(\u03c1(r)\u2212(\u03b1\u2212\n\nsurface tension effects. We plot in Fig. 1 the average distance between the innermost layers in two Si(001) slabs\nof 8 and 16 layers, as a function of the pressure parameter\nP entering our functional (1). A remarkable agreement\nis found with the results obtained when calculating the\nphysical pressure [22] in a bulk silicon system having the\nsame geometry and compressed along the [001] direction.\nFor the 8-layer slab a full quantum-mechanical calculation taking into account explicitly argon as a pressurizing\nmedium has been performed, delivering an even closer\nagreement (at least up to 20 GPa) to our electronicenthalpy results. This agreement clearly demonstrates\nthat the minimization of the quantum enthalpy correctly\naccounts for the effects of pressure; in addition, agreement is reached rapidly with respect to system size [23].\nOur case studies are group-IV nanoparticles M35 H36\nduring a shock wave (M corresponds to Si, Ge and C).\nThe initial configurations, carved from bulk diamond,\nhave all dangling bonds saturated with hydrogens. The\nstructures were relaxed and thermalized for 2-3 ps at 300\nK and zero pressure, at which point the ionic thermostat was switched off (no electronic thermostat is needed\nin these simulations). We modeled the adiabatic compression characterizing a shock wave with a linear increase in hydrostatic pressure from 0 to 40 GPa for 1\nps, followed by 0.75 ps at constant pressure and by a\nlinear decrease to 0 GPa in 1 ps. The system was finally allowed to evolve at zero pressure for another 810 ps. The structural transformations occurring during the shock are highlighted in Figs. 2 and 3, where\nthe time evolution of the average bond length, quantum volume, and average coordination of the ions are\nshown for the three nanoparticles. The response of the\nSi nanoparticle (see Fig. 2) is remarkable: a transition is\ninduced \u223c0.6 ps into the compression (P \u2243 26-28 GPa),\nat which point the system amorphizes. In this process\nthe second shell of neighbors overlaps and merges with\nthe first, increasing the coordination of the ions (see Fig.\n3) from 3.0 - due to the undercoordinated surface atoms\n- to \u223c5.5. The compressed bonds recover, albeit only\non average, the zero-pressure equilibrium length; volume\ncontraction is achieved by a collapse of the coordination\nshells rather than a shortening of the nearest bonds. The\nresulting amorphous configuration remains stable after\npressure is released, and no recrystallization is detected\nin the following 8-10 ps. A structural relaxation confirms that the amorphous nanoparticle corresponds to a\nwell-defined local minimum for the potential energy surface; this minimum is 11.15 eV (0.32 eV per silicon atom)\nhigher than the corresponding initial tetrahedral configuration. These results confirm the existence of an amorphous phase for silicon nanoparticles, as reported in Ref.\n[5] and also found in the simulations of Refs. [12, 13].\nGermanium and carbon at these sizes display instead an\nelastic response (see Fig. 2) and the original tetrahedral\nstructure is recovered at the end of the simulation.

In both cases, however,\nthe average coordination of the ions is barely affected (see\nFig. 3) and the first two peaks in the pair-correlation\nfunction remain distinct at all times during the shock.\nThe differences observed in the structural behavior are\nalso reflected in the thermodynamics of the compression\nprocess. In Fig. 4 we show the mechanical work exerted on the nanoparticles by the compression wave; in\nourRapproach this can be straightforwardly determined\nby P dV , whereas the fluctuations of an explicit pressurizing medium would hinder the volume changes of the\nquantum fragment. It is immediately evident that the\n\nSi nanoparticle absorbs a great amount of mechanical\nenergy: a portion of this energy is converted into kinetic energy of the ions, thanks to enhanced anharmonic\ncoupling between acoustic and optical phonons, while a\nlarger part goes into the plastic deformation and transition into the metastable amorphous phase. Both the\ndiamond nanoparticle and (to a lesser extent) the germanium one release instead elastically all the mechanical\nenergy absorbed during the shock and stored in the compression of the covalent bonds.\nKinetic trapping for small Si nanoparticles has been\ndemonstrated in Ref. [5], with an amorphous phase appearing during pressure release below 5 GPa. In agreement with Ref. [5], we find an enhancement with respect to the bulk for the pressure transition during the\nupstroke phase; our nanoparticle falls directly in the\namorphous phase, without an intermediate Imma or \u03b2Sn phase. Pressure-induced amorphization was observed\nwhen studying porous silicon films containing diamondstructure nanocrystals under load [24]; amorphization\nwas also found in bulk first-principles simulations [25, 26]\nin the 11-15 GPa range. The importance of the rate of\nload release on the structural transformation in Si and\nGe was highlighted in Ref. [27]. We have verified that\nchanging the speed of the shock wave by a factor of 1/15,\n1/2, or the initial temperature of the system from 300 K\nto 100 K, did not change the amorphization pathway or\nthe transition pressure. We also carefully confirmed that\nthe nanoparticle never becomes liquid.\nFinally, we examined the effects that the threshold\nparameter \u03b1 defining the quantum volume has on the\nisoenthalpic dynamics. The silicon simulation was repeated using \u03b1 = 0.0005 electrons/(a.u.)3 (\u03b1 = 0.0002\nelectrons/(a.u.)3 was used for all previous simulations).\nWhile at 0 GPa this different choice leads to a volume\ndifference of \u223c 10%, in the course of the compression the\ntwo definitions rapidly converge to the same value; the\n\n\fEnergy (eV)\n\n4\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n60\n\ntion, and sizes.

More importantly, the energy absorbed\nis shown to be the same independently of our choice of\nthreshold; the outer \"electronic skin\" releases elastically\nat the end of the run any energy stored at the beginning\nof the simulation.\nIn conclusion, we have introduced a novel approach\nin the study of finite systems under pressure, based\non the quantum-mechanical definition of an electronicenthalpy functional. This method is straightforward to\nimplement in static and dynamical first-principles calculations, and opens the study of the phase stability\nand kinetics of finite quantum systems to extensive firstprinciples simulations. Its accuracy and broad independence on the isosurface threshold have also been established. We have studied the behavior of semiconducting\nnanoparticles (M35 H36 , with M = Si, Ge, and C) during a hydrostatic shock wave, highlighting the different\nresponse of the three materials. Small silicon nanoparticles undergo plastic amorphization at pressures larger\nthan those required to amorphize a bulk system, while\ncarbon nanoparticles (and to a lesser extent germanium\nones) elastically recover their original tetrahedral structure [28]. A large amount of mechanical energy is absorbed by silicon nanoparticles as internal energy of their\namorphous phase and kinetic energy of the ions. This\nenergy will be released in longer timescales than those\nof a traveling shock wave, hinting at the possibility of\ndesigning a nanostructured impact-absorbing material.\nIt is also envisioned that the transition pressures, decay\ntimescales, and the overall mechanical response could be\ntuned by an appropriate choice of materials, composi-\n\n[1] S.
