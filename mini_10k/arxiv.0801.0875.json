In this article we collect a series of observations that constrain actions of many groups on compact manifolds. In particular, we\nshow that \"generic\" finitely generated groups have no smooth volume\npreserving actions on compact manifolds while also producing many\nfinitely presented, torsion free groups with the same property.\n\n1. Introduction\nThere are a number of interesting conjectures concerning actions of large\ngroups on manifolds, particularly conjectures of Gromov and Zimmer on\nactions of higher rank lattices and Lie groups. In this context, Gromov\nconjectured that a random group should not have any smooth actions on\nany compact manifold. In this paper we show that, in an appropriate model\nof randomness, a random group has no smooth volume preserving actions\non compact manifolds.\nWe begin by defining the class of groups for which we can prove this result. That this class is in some sense \"generic\" is justified and discussed in\nSection 3. In that section we also discuss some \"less generic\" groups satisfying our hypotheses. While the notion of genericity we use necessarily\nproduces groups that are not finitely presented, we also provide many examples of finitely presented groups satisfying our hypothesis. In both cases,\nwe produce groups that are torsion free. See \u00a74.2 of this paper for further\ndiscussion of both Gromov's conjecture and the meaning of \"generic\" or\n\"random\" group.\nLet \u0393 be a finitely generated group. We say \u0393 has no finite quotients\nif there are no non-trivial homomorphisms from \u0393 to a finite group. We\nsay \u0393 has property (F HM ) if any \u0393 action on a complete CAT(0) Hilbert\nmanifold has a fixed point. By a non-positively curved Hilbert manifold, we\nmean a complete geodesic CAT(0) metric space all of whose tangent cones\nare (isometric to) Hilbert spaces. We remark that property (F HM ) implies\nproperty (F H), the fixed point property on Hilbert spaces, which (for locally\ncompact groups) is equivalent to property (T ).\nThe main result of this paper is:\n\nThe first named author partially supported by NSF grants DMS-0541917 and 0643546.\nThe second named author partially supported by NSF grant DMS-0635607.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nDAVID FISHER AND LIOR SILBERMAN\n\nTheorem 1.1. Let \u0393 be a finitely generated group with no finite quotients\nand property (F HM ). Then any volume preserving action of \u0393 on a compact\nmanifold is trivial.\n\nSince every finite group admits many actions on compact manifolds, the\nassumption of no finite quotients is necessary. For weaker statements on\ngroups with property (F HM ) but with finite quotients, see Proposition\n2.3 and Theorem 2.5. We construct many torsion free groups satisfying\nthe hypotheses of Theorem 1.1. In Section 3, we also discuss other classes\nof groups which satisfy the conclusion of Proposition 2.3 without having\nproperty (F HM ). We include some observations concerning groups with no\nactions by homeomorphisms on any compact manifold in Section 4. These\nlast results depend heavily on torsion elements.\nThe proof of Theorem 1.1 involves three steps. First, we observe that if a\ngroup \u0393 has property (F HM ) then any volume preserving action on a compact manifold preserves a measurable Riemannian metric. Then we apply a\ntheorem of Zimmer [Z2] to show that the invariant measurable metric and\nthe fact that \u0393 has property (T ) imply that the action has discrete spectrum,\ni.e. that the unitary representation of \u0393 on L2 (M ) decomposes as a sum of\nof finite dimensional subspaces. The fact that \u0393 has no finite quotients implies that it has no non-trivial finite-dimensional representations. It follows\nthat the representation of \u0393 on L2 (M ) is trivial which immediately implies\nthat the \u0393 action on M is trivial.\nThis article is motivated by the growing interest in many quarters in the\nconjecture that random groups don't act on manifolds. No one interested in\nthe conjecture seemed to know the proof of Theorem 1.1 or it's application\nto \"generic\" finitely generated groups.\nAcknowledgements: The trick of combining Zimmer's theorem from [Z2]\nwith no finite quotients is first observed in [FM], though in a slightly more\nroundabout fashion. Many thanks to Furman and Monod for interesting\nconversations.\nThe torsion tricks used in section 4.1 were explained to the first author\nby Benson Farb in April of 2007. They seem to have been observed by many\npeople simultaneously and independently, see e.g. [BV, W]. The application\nhere to Kac-Moody groups appears to be new.\nThanks to Goulnara Arzhantseva and Ashot Minasyan for pointing out\nthe latter two methods of constructing groups without finite quotients in\nsection 3.3. Also thanks to Alain Valette and Yann Ollivier for useful remarks on an earlier version of this paper and to Martin Bridson for sharing\nthe observation that other groups satisfy Corollary 4.2.\nConversations leading to this paper started in the workshop \"Geometrical\nand Topological Rigidity\" held at the Banff International Research Station\nin July 2007.\n\n\fGROUPS NOT ACTING\n\n3\n\n2. Proof of Theorem 1.1\nWe briefly recall the construction of the space of \"L2 metrics\" on a manifold M . Given a volume form \u03c9 on M , we can consider the space of\nall (smooth) Riemannian metrics on M whose associated volume form is\n\u03c9. This is the space of smooth sections of a bundle P \u2192M . The fiber\nof P is X = SL(n, R)/SO(n). The bundle P is an associated bundle to\nthe SL(n, R) sub-bundle of the frame bundle of M defined by \u03c9. The\nspace X carries a natural SL(n, R)-invariant Riemannian metric of nonpositive curvature; we denote its associated distance function by dX . This\ninduces a natural\nnotion of distance on the space of metrics, given by\nR\nd(g1 , g2 )2 = M dX (g1 (m), g2 (m))2 d\u03c9. The completion of the sections with\nrespect to the metric d will be denoted L2 (M, \u03c9, X); it is commonly referred\nto as the space of L2 metrics on M and its elements will be called L2 metrics on M . That this space is CAT(0) follows easily from the fact that X is\nCAT(0). For more discussion of X and its structure as a Hilbert manifold,\nsee e.g. [FH]. It is easy to check that a volume preserving \u0393 action on M\ndefines an isometric \u0393 action on L2 (M, \u03c9, X).\nMore generally, we can replace X by any symmetric space Y of noncompact type and consider the same construction for any Y bundle over M .\nIn fact, the same construction applies if (M, \u03c9) is just a standard finite measure space and does not depend on the differentiable structure of M . The\nresulting space is called a continuum product. One method for obtaining an\nisometric \u0393 action on L2 (M, \u03c9, Y ) is to have an \u03c9 preserving \u0393 action on\nM and a cocycle \u03b1 : \u0393\u00d7M \u2192 Isom(Y ) satisfying an integral bound (ensuring\nthat the \u0393 action preserves the space L2 (M, \u03c9, Y )). We call such actions\ncocycle actions. Not all isometric \u0393 actions arise in this way. This construction contains the case Y = Rn , in which case L2 (M, \u03c9, Y ) is a Hilbert space\nand there are many isometric actions not arising from cocycles over actions\non Y . This is essentially the only way in which non-cocycle actions arise in\nthis setting, see [FH] for more discussion.\nWe say a group \u0393 has property (F CP ) if for any non-positively curved\nsymmetric space Y , any finite measure space (M, \u03c9) and any isometric \u0393\naction on L2 (M, \u03c9, Y ), the \u0393 action has a fixed point. Clearly property\n(F HM ) implies property (F CP ). Since we do not assume our actions are\ncocycle actions, any group with property (F CP ) also has property (F H).\nOur argument establishes the following strengthening of Theorem 1.1:\nTheorem 2.1. Let \u0393 be a finitely generated group with property (F CP )\nand no finite quotients, then any volume preserving \u0393 action on a compact\nmanifold is trivial.\nLemma 2.2. Let \u0393 be a group with property (F CP ). Then any volume\npreserving \u0393 action on a compact manifold M preserves an L2 metric.\nThis observation is immediate from the definitions and appears to be\nwell-known, but does not appear anywhere in the literature.\n\n\f4\n\nDAVID FISHER AND LIOR SILBERMAN\n\nCombining Lemma 2.2 with a result of Zimmer [Z2, Theorem 1.7], we\nhave:\nProposition 2.3. Let \u0393 be a group with property (F CP ). Then any volume\npreserving \u0393 action on a compact manifold M has discrete spectrum.\nAs mentioned in the introduction, discrete spectrum means that the unitary representation of \u0393 on L2 (M, \u03c9) splits as an infinite direct sum of finite\ndimensional representations. In particular, Proposition 2.3 implies that no\ngroup with property (F CP ) has a volume preserving weak mixing action on\ncompact manifolds. As in [Z2], one can deduce from Proposition 2.3 that\nthe action is measurably isometric, i.e. measurably conjugate to an action\ndefined by embedding \u0393 in a compact group K. Much stronger results would\nfollow if one could prove that K was a Lie group. To show this, one can either show that enough of the \u0393 invariant subspaces of L2 (M ) are spanned by\nsmooth functions or by proving directly that the invariant metric is smooth\n(or even just continuous).\nProving that K is a Lie group is a well-known and difficult problem. Here\nwe do not need to establish this \u2013 for our purposes it suffices to note that\nit embeds in a product of compact Lie groups. The proof of Theorem 2.1 is\ncompleted by the following proposition.\nProposition 2.4. Let \u0393 be a group with no finite images. Then any discrete\nspectrum action of \u0393 is trivial.\nProof. We have a \u0393 action on M whose action on L2 (M, \u03c9) splits as a sum of\nfinite dimensional representations \u03c0j on finite dimensional spaces Vj . Since\nfinitely generated linear groups are residually finite, each \u03c0j must have trivial\nimage. Therefore the \u0393 action on functions on M is trivial and so is the \u0393\naction on M .\n\u0003\nWe remark briefly on one strengthening of our main results. It is possible\nto have groups with only finitely many finite quotients. For such a group \u0393,\nthere is always a maximal finite quotient F\u0393 . Our methods also yield:\nTheorem 2.5. Let \u0393 be a group with property (F CP ) and with finitely\nmany finite quotients. Then any volume preserving \u0393 action on a compact\nmanifold factors through F\u0393 .\nWe remark that our results are stronger than the statements of Theorem\n2.1, Proposition 2.3 and Theorem 2.5. Indeed, to obtain the conclusion of\nthose theorems, we only require a fixed point in any action on the space\nL2 (M, \u03c9, X) coming from a smooth action on M or the even weaker condition of a measurable invariant metric. In particular, the conclusion of\nProposition 2.3 also holds for all lattices in higher rank semisisimple algebraic groups over fields of positive characteristic. In this context the\nZimmer-Margulis approach to super-rigidity for cocycles produces a measurable invariant metric and the groups are known to have property (T ), so\n\n\fGROUPS NOT ACTING\n\n5\n\none can apply [Z2, Theorem 1.2]. While it seems plausible that these groups\nalso have property (F HM ), this does not seem to be known.\n3. Groups satisfying the assumptions of Theorem 1.1\nIn this section, we discuss methods of constructing groups satisfying the\nhypotheses of Theorems 1.1 and 2.1. In the first two subsections, we discuss\ngroups with property (F HM ) and property (F CP ) respectively. In the final\nsubsection, we discuss various methods which, starting with a hyperbolic\ngroup with property (F HM ) or (F CP ), produce quotients of the given\ngroup with no finite quotients.\n3.1. Groups with property (F HM ). A criterion for property (F HM )\nin terms of actions on simplicial complexes is given explicitly in [IN]. This\ncriterion builds on earlier work of Wang [W1, W2]. A similar criterion is\nestablished in a unpublished preprint of Schoen and Wang [SW]. Combined\nwith Zuk's work on random groups in the triangular model, this implies\nthat a random group in the triangular model at density more than 1/3 has\nproperty (F HM ) with high probability. As remarked in [O1, I.3.g] this\nthen implies the same property for random group in the density model with\ndensity more than 1/3 with high probability. More recently Naor-Silberman\n[NS] have given proofs that property (F HM ) (and more) holds with high\nprobability for random groups in the graph model of [Gr2]. Also, Silberman\nhas given a simpler proof that property (F HM ) holds in the density model\nat density greater than 1/3 [S]. In the context of [NS], we need much less\nthan is used there. Here we can get by with adding relations corresponding\nto a single graph to a non-abelian free group, rather than considering an\ninfinite sequence of graphs. The existence of such groups is fully justified\nby [O2]. We remark here that all the groups mentioned in this paragraph\nare, with high probability, aspherical and hyperbolic. This is important for\nconstructing quotients of these groups with no finite factors. Here, a group\nis aspherical if it has an aspherical presentation. In particular, this implies\nthe group is torsion free.\nAny cocompact group of isometries of a building of type \u00c32 can be shown\nto have property (F HM ) by the methods of [IN]. These groups therefore\nsatisfy 2.3. It seems quite likely that the same is true of cocompact groups\nof isometries of irreducible higher rank buildings. It seems plausible that the\nsame should be true for non-uniform lattices. Since none of these groups is\nhyperbolic, we cannot use them to build examples with no finite quotients.\n3.2. Groups with property (F CP ). It follows from the main results of\n[FH] that any quotient of a lattice \u0393\u0303 in Sp(1, n) by an infinite normal subgroup has property (F CP ). Again by standard constructions, one can construct such a quotient \u0393 which is torsion free and hyperbolic, see [O1, Chapter II] for discussion and references. It is not clear that one can construct\nthe quotient to be aspherical, so it is not clear that our first method for\n\n\f6\n\nDAVID FISHER AND LIOR SILBERMAN\n\nproducing groups with no finite quotients can be used for these groups, see\nbelow.\n3.3. Groups with no finite quotients.\nMethod One: Given an aspherical hyperbolic group, there is a standard\nmethod of using iterated random quotient to produce from it a group with\nno fnite quotients. The finite stages of this process preserve the property of\nbeing aspherical. The process is described on [O1, Section IV.k.] and is originally due to Gromov [Gr1]. This process can be applied to any aspherical\nhyperbolic group with property (F HM ) or (F CP ), to obtain finitely generated, infinitely presented groups with no finite quotients and with property\n(F HM ) or property (F CP ). This uses the fact that like property (F H),\nproperties (F HM ) and (F CP ) both obviously pass to quotients. We remark\nhere that this method of producing groups without finite quotients depends\nonly on having infinitely many relators chosen at random. The hard part of\nthe construction is guaranteeing that the resulting group is infinite.\nIt seems plausible that all assertions in the previous paragraph are true\nfor torsion free hyperbolic groups and not just aspherical ones. This is not\ncurrently known and is technically a much more difficult question. Because\nof this difficulty, it is not clear that one apply this construction to the\nquotients of lattices in SP (1, n) in \u00a73.2.\nMethod Two: In [Ol2], Ol'shanski gives a method of producing infinite\ngroups with no finite quotients from any hyperbolic group. It is not clear\nfrom that article that this method can be used to produce torsion free groups\nthough it may be possible to achieve this using in addition arguments from\n[Ol1]. The method does produce groups that are finitely presented. This\nmethod applies to both random hyperbolic groups and to cocompact lattices\nin Sp(1, n).\nMethod Three: In this method we use results from [Os] and [AMO] in\na manner inspired by [ABJLMS].\nLet F be any group with no finite quotients and at least three generators.\nThen the free product K = F \u2217 F is hyperbolic relative to its two free\nfactors. Also, K is finitely presented and torsion free if F is. Let H be\nany relatively hyperbolic group. Then by [AMO, Theorem 1.4] and [Os,\nTheorem 2.4] there exists an infinite relatively hyperbolic group \u0393 that is a\ncommon quotient of K and H such that \u0393 is finitely presented and torsion\nfree if K and H. The peripheral subgroups of G are exactly images of the\nperipheral subgroups of K and H.\nTo apply this result in our context it suffices to find groups F which are\nfinitely presented, torsion free and have no finite quotients. One can use,\ne.g. the finitely presented torsion free simple groups constructed by Burger\nand Mozes [BM] or the four generated Higman group with the presentation\nha, b, c, d|ab = a2 , bc = b2 , cd = c2 , da = d2 i.\n\n\fGROUPS NOT ACTING\n\n7\n\nThis technique can be applied to produce groups with no finite quotients\nfrom random hyperbolic groups and from both uniform and non-uniform\nlattices in Sp(1, n).\nWhen applying either of the last two methods to lattices in Sp(1, n), one\ncan apply them directly to the lattice. Since the method produces infinite\ngroups with no finite quotients, it is clearly producing quotients of the lattice\nby infinite normal subgroups of infinite index.\n4. Other groups not acting and some questions\nWe close with two collections of remarks. In the first subsection, we\ndiscuss other reasons why torsion impedes non-trivial group actions, mostly\nto explain our emphasis on producing torsion free groups. In the second\nsubsection, we ask some questions motivated by this work and Gromov's\nconjecture.\n4.1. Torsion tricks. This section points out some classes of groups with\nno actions by homeomorphisms on compact manifolds. The main point is\nthe following fact. We learned it from Farb and Whyte, but it appears to\nbe known independently by many people see e.g. [BV, W].\nLemma 4.1. Let \u0393 be a simple group that contains a copy of (Z/pZ)\u221e .\nThen \u0393 has no non-trivial actions by homeomorphisms on any compact manifold.\nThe lemma is simply the fact, see e.g. [MS], that for any compact manifold\nM , there is a number k = k(M ) such that a faithful action of (Z/pZ)n by\nhomeomorphisms on M implies n \u2264 k. Farb and Whyte observed that by\nresults in [Sch] one can construct a two generated simple group \u0393 containing\nthe lamplighter group Z \u2240 Z/pZ. The lemma then implies that this group\n\u0393 has no non-trivial actions by homeomorphisms on any compact manifold.\nOne can also give a proof of Shmuel Weinberger's observation [Z3] that\nSL(\u221e, Z) does not act on a compact manifold using the same observations,\nMargulis' normal subgroups theorem and the congruence subgroup property\nfor SL(n, Z).\nA more constructive method for finding finitely presented simple groups\ncontaining (Z/pZ)\u221e is the theory of Kac-moody groups. Lemma 4.1, the\nmain theorem of [CR] and [R, Proof of Theorem 4.6] imply that:\nCorollary 4.2. Let \u0393 be a split or almost split Kac-Moody group over the\nfinite field Z/pZ with an infinite, irreducible, non-affine Weyl group. If p is\nlarge enough, then any \u0393 action by homeomorphisms on a compact manifold\nis trivial.\nWe remark here that the \u0393 in the corollary is finitely presented. Bridson has independently observed that Thompson's group V and the variants\nconstructed by Higman satisfy a similar conclusion for the same reasons.\nKac-Moody groups are of particular interest in this context because they are\n\n\f8\n\nDAVID FISHER AND LIOR SILBERMAN\n\nlattices in locally compact groups. Historically the motivation for studying\nquestions concerning groups (not) acting on compact manifolds derives from\nZimmer's conjectures concerning actions of lattices in Lie groups and also\nalgebraic groups over other local fields.\nIn a recent paper [ABJLMS], similar and more elaborate uses of torsion\nhave led to classes of infinite groups with no non-trivial actions on certain\nclasses of non-compact manifolds and also more general spaces.\n4.2. Further questions. The results in this paper raise an obvious sequence of questions. Are there finitely generated or even finitely presented,\ntorsion free groups with no non-trivial actions on compact manifolds? One\ncan ask the question either for actions by homeomorphisms or for actions by\ndiffeomorphisms. It seems plausible that most groups will have no smooth\nactions. Unless the manifold acted on is the circle, there are no known\nobstructions to any torsion free group acting by homoeomorphisms on any\ncompact manifold. While producing a few sporadic examples would already be quite interesting, there is significantly more interest in showing\nthat having no non-trivial actions is typical (\"generic\") in a model for random groups. However, it is important to note that groups chosen according\nto such a model are not \"generic\" in the way that \"random regular graphs\"\nare \u2013 there is currently no good notion of a \"typical\" group.\nMore concretely, to reduce Gromov's conjecture to Theorem 1.1, one\nwants to prove:\nConjecture 4.3. In an appropriate model for random groups, any action\nof a\"generic\" group \u0393 on a compact manifold M preserves a smooth volume\nform.\nThe conjecture is interesting in the context of groups satisfying Theorems\n1.1, 2.1, 2.5 or even just Proposition 2.3. It seems reasonable to try to\napproach Conjecture 4.3 as a fixed point problem. It is worth noting that\nthe fixed point property used must be strictly stronger than property (T ) as\nmany linear (T ) groups admit actions on manifolds that do not preserve a\nvolume form. A version of this conjecture was asked as a question by Nigel\nHigson at the July 2007 Banff workshop.\nAnother reasonable and fairly well known question also motivated by the\nwork in this paper and Gromov's conjecture.\nQuestion 4.4. Is there a number 21 > d > 0 for which a random group\nwith density at least d has no finite quotients with positive probability? With\nprobability tending to 1?\nIn particular, a positive answer to this question would produce many\nhyperbolic groups which are not residually finite.\nReferences\n[ABJLMS] G. Arzhantseva, M. R.
