Despite the non-renormalizable nature of the theory, we observe\nonly a mild cut-off dependence of the physical observables. We also show evidence that\nthere is a region in the parameter space where the system behaves in a way consistent\nwith dimensional reduction.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nSpontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) is the phenomenon where the ground state of a\nsystem does not access all of its available symmetry, apparently breaking the symmetry\ngroup to a subgroup. In the Standard Model (SM) this is a crucial mechanism and it is\nnot only responsible for predicting the existence of a fundamental scalar field, the Higgs\nparticle, but also for the gauge bosons and fermions acquiring a mass. The somewhat\n\n1\n\n\funsatisfactory fact about this mechanism in the SM, is that the Higgs potential, which\nis the concrete object that drives SSB, is input by hand at tree level in the Lagrangian,\nsimply because we do not have any more fundamental way to generate it. There are\nmany ideas of course trying to suggest an origin for the Higgs and its potential, one of the\nmost elegant being that the Higgs field is the extra dimensional component of a higher\ndimensional gauge field and that the potential is generated quantum mechanically [1].\nThe earliest scenarios considered as extra-dimensional space the sphere S 2 [2, 3, 4, 5]. In\nlater applications the extra-dimensional space was taken to be non-simply connected, like\nS 1 or T 2 [6, 7, 8], so that the (non-contractible) Polyakov loops are non-trivial. This is\nthe general context where we would like to put ourselves in the present work. Alternative\nways to achieve SSB in gauge theories with extra dimensions are discussed in [9, 10].\nThere are enough motivations to take this idea seriously besides the economic way of\ngenerating the Higgs with its potential but the property that drew a lot of recent attention\nto these theories is the so claimed attractive possibility of all order finiteness of the physical\nscalar mass. This sounds like a paradox from the beginning since the very point which\nhas kept many field theorists rather hesitant from taking such an idea seriously is that\nhigher (than four) dimensional gauge theories are non-renormalizable and in a typical\nnon-renormalizable theory one would expect that a mass parameter receives quantum\ncorrections appearing in an arbitrary power of some dimensionless quantity built out of a\ndimensionful coupling and the cut-off. This is to be compared with the renormalizable SM\nwhere the couplings are dimensionless and the Higgs mass receives only a quadratic ultraviolet (UV) cut-off dependence under quantum corrections. Since even this quadratic\nUV sensitivity has been viewed as a drawback, supersymmetric generalizations of the SM\nwere introduced and analyzed in detail, where the power like cut-off sensitivity is not\npresent due to cancellations of infinities between superpartners. There is no doubt that\nsupersymmetry is an elegant solution to the problem but it could happen that it is not\nrealized at energies accessible in near future collider experiments so it is useful to be aware\nof alternative solutions. Back then to extra dimensions, in the case where the extra (fifth\nhere) dimension is compactified on a circle, one can carry out a one-loop calculation of\nthe Higgs mass and verify its aforementioned finiteness [11,12] and can even give all order\narguments to that effect [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20], but the problem with this solution is\nthat a simple circle compactification can not be realistic for various reasons, the absence\nof chiral fermions being one of the main.\nA way out is to compactify the extra dimension on an interval I1 instead of a circle,\nwhich can support chiral fermions at the two ends of the interval. Since the interval\ncan be obtained easily from the circle by \"orbifolding\", i.e. by identifying points and\nfields in the circle theory under the Z2 reflection operator R : x5 \u2212\u2192 \u2212x5 , we will\nuse the name orbifold when we refer to such a theory. A characteristic property of this\n2\n\n\forbifold is that it is defined on a space with two four dimensional boundaries at each\nof the fixed points of the reflection action, where the gauge symmetry is reduced, thus\nnaturally differentiating the boundaries from the rest of the space, which we call the bulk.\nAn unfortunate consequence of field theories defined in such spaces is that the all order\nfiniteness of the Higgs mass arguments are not anymore applicable because of the bulkboundary interactions appearing at higher orders in perturbation theory which start to\ninfect the finite bulk mass with cut-off dependence [21]. This is not unexpected; it is\nknown that handling non-renormalizable theories analytically is not easy, in fact there is\nno general prescription that can be used in these theories such that their predictions are\ntrustworthy.\nWe would therefore like here to start a systematic investigation of higher dimensional\norbifold gauge theories from the point of view of a lattice regularization [17, 22, 23]. The\ntheory which will serve as our concrete example is an SU(2) gauge theory which has the\nsymmetry broken (by boundary conditions) to its U(1) subgroup on the boundaries. This,\nwe will argue, is a promising way of approaching extra dimensional theories: the goal is\na non-perturbative understanding of a class of non-renormalizable theories and the hope\nis a non-perturbative understanding of the SM Higgs mechanism.\nIt turns out that phenomenology puts surprisingly tight constraints on models and\nwe will concentrate here on the two most immediate ones as one proceeds with the construction. One is associated with the mere existence of a four dimensional effective action\nand the second, closely related to SM phenomenology, the expected hierarchy of masses\nbetween the physical Higgs and the massive gauge bosons in the broken phase of the SM.\n1.1\n\nDimensional reduction\n\nThe first issue is to show that an extra dimensional theory possesses in its parameter\nspace a regime where it undergoes some kind of effective dimensional reduction. This can\nhappen, in principle, in more than one ways. Historically, the first mechanism of hiding\nthe extra dimension is going to the \"Kaluza-Klein gauge\" and making the size of the extra\ndimension small enough, so that its effects are negligible up to a certain energy scale and\nat the same time keeping the couplings perturbative so that the resulting effective theory\ncan be useful for electroweak (or gravitational) physics. This is of course guaranteed as\nlong as one treats the radius of the circle R, the cut-off1 \u039b and the gauge coupling g5\nas independent parameters which is perhaps justified to a certain extent \u2013 it depends\nessentially on how far one is willing to go in perturbation theory. In a non-perturbative\nformulation on the other hand it becomes right away obvious that these three parameters\n1\n\nExtra-dimensional theories are non-renormalizable and make sense only with a cut-off in place.\n\n3\n\n\fare tightly connected from the beginning and depending on where one sits in parameter\nspace, a small change in one of the parameters could result in a dramatic change of the\nsystem. From this point of view, the region in parameter space where the theory describes\nthe real world, (if it exists) could be only a small patch, which makes one wonder whether\nthe free stretching of the dimensionful parameters sometimes employed to make a model\nphenomenologically viable is a valid operation.\nMore recently, mechanisms of dimensional reduction which depend on localization\nrather than compactification have been proposed. In the context of gauge theories, all\nof these mechanisms involve one way or another a strong coupling and therefore nonperturbative physics. One, is the so called layered phase originally proposed in [24].\nThe idea is to investigate a five-dimensional lattice model where the gauge coupling in\nthe four dimensional slices along the extra dimension is different from the gauge coupling\nthat describes the interaction between the slices. This anisotropy could give rise to a new,\nso-called layered, phase where the static force is of Coulomb type in the four-dimensional\nslices and confining along the extra dimension, thus providing a localization mechanism.\nSome evidence for the existence of the layered phase in Abelian gauge theory was recently\ngiven in [25]. Another similar idea was due to [26] where it is assumed that the system\nhas a phase where the bulk is in a confined while the boundary (defined by a domain wall)\nis in a deconfined phase, which forces the boundary gauge fields to remain localized. This\nidea was investigated on the lattice [27] and it was found that the low-energy effective\ntheory contains not only the localized zero-modes but also higher Kaluza\u2013Klein modes.\nA different mechanism of dimensional reduction was proposed in the context of the Dtheory regularization of non-Abelian gauge theories [28,29,30]. Here a non-Abelian gauge\ntheory in five dimensions arises as a low-energy effective description of a five-dimensional\nquantum link model. The size L of four dimensions is taken to be infinity and the fifth\ndimension has a finite size R. If the five-dimensional theory happens to be in the Coulomb\nphase, the gluons are not massless but gain a mass which is exponentially small in the\nsize of the extra-dimension. Thus by making R larger the correlation length given by\nthe inverse gluon mass grows exponentially fast in R and therefore the extra-dimension\ndisappears.\nIn this paper we will not be able to give a conclusive answer to this important issue\nsince it would involve a very extensive scan of the parameter space. We will give though\nsome indirect evidence for dimensional reduction in the orbifold theory and we will leave\nthe question of which mechanism is responsible for it, for a future work. At a qualitative\nlevel, we will be able to map the part of the parameter space of our model where simulations were carried out onto the phase diagram of a known and well understood four\ndimensional theory, the Abelian Higgs model, which provides our first indirect evidence\n\n4\n\n\ffor an effective dimensional reduction. Our more quantitative, but still indirect, evidence\nfor dimensional reduction will be the measurement of the static potential between two\ninfinitely heavy charged particles placed on four-dimensional slices located at the origin\nand in the middle of the fifth-dimension, separated by a distance r. Using the fact that we\nmeasure a massive U(1) gauge boson, we will fit the numerical data for the static potential\nto a five dimensional Yukawa potential and to a four dimensional Yukawa potential and\ncompare the fits in both cases.\n1.2\n\nHierarchy of masses\n\nA universal feature that perturbative five dimensional orbifold pure gauge theories seem\nto posses is that the gauge bosons that survive on the boundaries are all massless and the\nmass of the Higgs turns out to be too low. In order to make some of the gauge bosons heavy\none is forced to introduce fermions in the bulk [31], but still the ratio of the Higgs to the\ngauge boson mass is mh /m\u03b3 << 1 [32, 33] and thus phenomenologically excluded, unless\nadditional assumptions are made. This property has been traced to the fact that since in\nfive dimensions gauge invariance forbids a tree level Higgs mass, it has to be generated\nquantum mechanically. This one-loop mass turns out to be suppressed compared to the\ngauge boson mass which is governed by a vacuum expectation value of order one. More\nconcretely, at one loop, the Higgs mass is found to be mh \u223c g5 /R3/2 , where g5 is the fivedimensional gauge coupling, whereas the gauge boson mass is basically m\u03b3 \u223c \u03b1/R where\n\u03b1 is a dimensionless vacuum expectation value obtained from minimizing the potential\n(see Appendix A). Realistic models require a very small \u03b1 even though typical one-loop\npotentials tend to yield an \u03b1 which is either zero or of order \u223c 0.1.\nWe will be able to compute the ratio mh /m\u03b3 non-perturbatively and find that, contrary\nto perturbative expectations, a Higgs mechanism is at work, resulting into a non-zero\ngauge boson mass, for a large part of the parameter space (in fact for the whole range\nof parameters we were able to scan). Again, disentangling the precise dependence of\nthis ratio on compactification and finite lattice size effects requires a larger scan of the\nparameter space, which will be the topic of a future work.\n1.3\n\nOrganization of the paper\n\nIn this paper we investigate numerically a one dimensional subspace of the parameter space\nof a five dimensional lattice gauge theory, starting from the vicinity of a first order phase\ntransition and approaching the perturbative domain. In section 2, using generic properties\nof the measured orbifold spectrum, we argue that the spectrum of the system in part of\nthis region seems to be consistent with an effective dimensional reduction. In section 3 we\n5\n\n\fconstruct in detail the lattice regulated theory and in particular its observables. In section\n4 we present in detail our quantitative evidence for spontaneous symmetry breaking and\ndimensional reduction. In section 5 we state our conclusions. Finally, for completeness\nwe provide two detailed appendices with some background, appendix A on 1-loop results\nand B on the derivation of the five-dimensional Yukawa potential.\n\n2\n\nThe orbifold effective theory\n\nWe consider a pure SU(2) Yang\u2013Mills (YM) theory in five dimensions with gauge potential\nAM , M = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5. The fifth dimension is an interval, obtained by identifying points\nand fields on a circle of radius R under the Z2 reflection operator R : x5 \u2212\u2192 \u2212x5 . The\nprojection breaks the gauge symmetry at the two ends of the interval according to\nSU(2) \u2212\u2192 U(1) .\n\n(2.1)\n\nIn the picture of dimensional reduction as it is known in finite temperature field theory [34]\nthe five-dimensional fields are expanded in a Fourier series in the quantized momentum\nalong the compact dimension. At low energies, in our case much below the compactification scale given by the inverse radius 1/R, we have an effective four-dimensional theory\nof the zero-modes (i.e. constant along the fifth dimension) of the fields.\nBut the Fourier series that defines the Kaluza\u2013Klein expansion breaks gauge invariance. This we cannot afford at the non-perturbative level. Here the particle spectrum is\nread off from correlations of five-dimensional, gauge invariant operators. These operators\nare classified according to specific symmetries. If dimensional reduction occurs, a mass gap\nin the various particle channels should be seen. The ground state of the operators which\ncorresponds to the A5 gauge field component2 has the quantum numbers of a complex\nscalar and the ground state of the A\u03bc , \u03bc = 0, 1, 2, 3 components3 have quantum numbers of\na U(1) gauge field from the point of view of four dimensions. Clearly, the lowest lying spectrum of the orbifold theory should coincide with the one of the four-dimensional Abelian\nHiggs model4 , if dimensional reduction works like in finite temperature field theory. The\nspectra with the higher excitations included will be different, as in the five-dimensional\ntheory they are sensitive to the compactification scale 1/R. Before defining the orbifold\ntheory in great detail and present extensive simulation results (which will be the topic of\nthe next sections), one would hope to be able to exploit this similarity of spectra by mapping the phase diagram of the orbifold simulation on the phase diagram of the Abelian\n2\n\nIn Section 3.1.2 we will specify the gauge-invariant meaning of this, related to the Polyakov line.\nIn Section 3.2 we will construct a gauge-invariant operator that corresponds to the gauge bosons,\nvery much in analogy with the four-dimensional SU (2) Higgs model [35].\n4\nWe thank U.-J. Wiese for his comments in this respect.\n3\n\n6\n\n\fHiggs model. Being able to do so, would be a first circumstantial evidence for an effective\ndimensional reduction.\nNext, we define the parameter space of our model. In a lattice regularization, the cutoff is provided by the inverse lattice spacing \u039b = a\u22121 and it preserves gauge invariance.\nThat is why the lattice formulation is particularly useful to study non-renormalizable\ntheories, which requires a cut-off. The parameter space of the lattice theory is two dimensional5 . One of the parameters is the (dimensionless) number of lattice points in the\nfifth dimension\n\u03c0R\n(2.2)\nN5 =\na\nand the second is the dimensionless five dimensional lattice coupling\n2N\n2N\n\u03b2= 2 a= 2 ,\n(2.3)\ng5\ng0\nwhere g0 is the dimensionless bare gauge coupling. For later reference, notice that in\nregions of the parameter space where g5 has a mild cut-off dependence, \u03b2 is inversely\nproportional to \u039b. All observables are computed in units of the lattice spacing, or equivalently in units of R, and are thus functions of N5 and \u03b2. One can also define a derived\nparameter, the coupling\n\u03c0R\n1\n(2.4)\n\u03b24ef f \u2261 2 = 2 ,\ng4\ng5\nfor the effective four-dimensional theory. It is also possible in principle to use an anisotropic\nlattice [36] in which case a lattice gauge coupling (and a different lattice spacing) is defined for the fifth dimension (\u03b25 ) and a different one for the four dimensional subspace\n(\u03b24 ). Here we will restrict ourselves to isotropic lattices for which \u03b24 = \u03b25 = \u03b2.\nFrom simulations of the five dimensional SU(2) gauge theory on the orbifold S 1 /Z2\nwith the number of points in the extra dimension fixed to N5 = 4, and on an isotropic\nlattice with an associated coupling \u03b2, the spectrum can be safely determined when \u03b2\nis larger than a critical value \u03b2c = 1.5975, which separates a confined (\u03b2 < \u03b2c ) from a\ndeconfined (\u03b2 > \u03b2c ) phase. The spectrum measured in simulations corresponding to the\ndeconfined phase consists of a massive Higgs ground state and a massive Abelian gauge\nboson, along with their excitations [23] which implies that our system in this region of\nparameter space crosses from a confined phase into a Higgs phase. 6 In order to be able to\nmake a comparison with the Abelian Higgs model we now recall a few well known facts.\n5\n\nFor this discussion we assume the four-dimensional sizes of the lattice to be infinite.\nIf the four-dimensional effective theory were just a pure U (1) gauge theory, (due to the orbifold\nbreaking of the SU (2) symmetry) and dimensional reduction occurs, one should be able to map our\nresults onto the four-dimensional Abelian model. For N5 = 4 we have \u03b24ef f = \u03b2. The pure compact U (1)\ngauge theory has a phase transition at \u03b2c = 1.01 [37] and therefore we would end up in its Coulomb\nphase. Clearly, this can not be sufficient to describe our system because, as already mentioned, in the\ndeconfined phase we measure not only massive scalars but also a massive gauge boson.\n6\n\n7\n\n\fZ2 gauge theory\n\n\u03ba = inf\n\nHiggs\n\nXY\nconfinement\n\nCoulomb\n\n\u03ba=0\n\u03b2 = 0 Abelian gauge theory\n\n\u03b2 = inf\n\nFigure 1:\n\nPhase diagram of the Abelian Higgs model for the Higgs field with charge q = 2.\nFrom studies at \u03bb = \u221e [38].\nWe summarize results from analytic [38, 39] and numerical [40] studies of the four\ndimensional Abelian Higgs model. The Euclidean action may be written as\nX\u001a\nS =\n\u03bb(\u03c6\u2020 (x)\u03c6(x) \u2212 1)2 + \u03c6\u2020 (x)\u03c6(x)\nx\n\n\u2212\u03ba\n\nX\n\n\u2020\n\niqA\u03bc (x)\n\n\u03c6 (x)e\n\n\u03c6(x + a\u03bc\u0302) + c.c.\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u0001\n\n\u001b\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b2X\nUp .\n2 p\n\n(2.5)\n\nHere, \u03c6(x) is the complex Higgs field, q is its charge and \u03ba the hopping parameter related\nto the bare mass m0 through\na2 m20 =\n\n1 \u2212 2\u03bb\n\u22128.\n\u03ba\n\n(2.6)\n\nThe analytic study in [38] was performed in the limit \u03bb \u2192 \u221e where the length of the\nHiggs field \u03c1 is frozen to 1. In the unitary gauge the action then reads\nS = \u2212\u03ba\n\nX\n\u03bc\n\n2 cos[qA\u03bc (x)] \u2212\n\n\u03b2X\nUp .\n2 p\n\n(2.7)\n\nThere are two interesting cases. One is when the Higgs field is in the fundamental representation, that is it has charge q = 1 and the second is when it has charge q = 2. For\nus it is the second case that is relevant since, as will show in the next section, the lattice\noperator which is identified with the Higgs has charge two.\nWe inspect the action for \u03bb = \u221e in the unitary gauge, Eq. (2.7), in the limit \u03ba \u2192 \u221e.\nIn this limit the gauge variable A\u03bc (x) can take, for q = 2, two values, 0 or \u03c0, corresponding\n8\n\n\fto Z2 gauge links U(x, \u03bc) = \u00b11. (For general charge q it will be a Zq gauge theory). The\nZ2 gauge theory has a second order phase transition. The analytic study of [38] in the\n\u03bb = \u221e case concludes that there are three distinct phases, sketched in Fig. 1. The main\ndifference compared to the q = 1 case is a phase boundary that separates the Higgs from\nthe confinement phase. The static potential in the Higgs phase is of Yukawa type. In the\nconfinement phase it rises linearly (area law for Wilson loops) which is not the case in the\nconfinement region for a fundamental Higgs.\nClearly, this is the version of the Abelian Higgs model on which the orbifold theory\ncan be naturally mapped since the lowest lying spectra are the same and the part of the\norbifold phase diagram we have investigated can be recognized inside the phase diagram\nof the q = 2 Abelian Higgs model.\n\n3\n\nOrbifold on the lattice\n\nGauge theories on the orbifold can be discretized on the lattice [17, 22]. One starts with\na gauge theory formulated on a five-dimensional torus with lattice spacing a and periodic\nboundary conditions in all directions M = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5. The spatial directions (M = 1, 2, 3)\nhave length L, the time-like direction (M = 0) has length T , and the extra dimension\n(M = 5) has length 2\u03c0R. The coordinates of the points are labelled by integers n \u2261 {nM }\nand the gauge field is the set of link variables {U(n, M) \u2208 SU(N)}. The latter are related\nto a gauge potential AM in the Lie algebra of SU(N) by U(n, M) = exp{aAM (n)}.\nEmbedding the orbifold action in the gauge field on the lattice amounts to imposing on\nthe links the Z2 projection\n(1 \u2212 \u0393)U(n, M) = 0 ,\n(3.1)\nwhere \u0393 = RTg . Here, R is the reflection operator that acts as R n = (n\u03bc , \u2212n5 ) \u2261 n\u0304 (\u03bc =\n0, 1, 2, 3) on the lattice and as R U(n, \u03bc) = U(n\u0304, \u03bc) and R U(n, 5) = U \u2020 (n\u0304 \u2212 5\u0302, 5) on the\nlinks. The group conjugation Tg acts only on the links, as Tg U(n, M) = gU(n, M)g \u22121 ,\nwhere g is a constant SU(N) matrix with the property that g 2 is an element of the\ncentre of SU(N). For SU(2) we will take g = \u2212i\u03c3 3 . Only gauge transformations {\u03a9(n)}\nsatisfying (1 \u2212 \u0393)\u03a9 = 0 are consistent with Eq. (3.1). This means that at the orbifold\nfixed points, for which n5 = 0 or n5 = N5 , the gauge group is broken to the subgroup\nthat commutes with g. For SU(2) this is the U(1) subgroup parametrized by exp(i\u03c6\u03c3 3 ),\nwhere \u03c6 are compact phases.\nAfter the projection in Eq. (3.1), the fundamental domain is the strip I1 = {n\u03bc , 0 \u2264\nn5 \u2264 N5 }. The gauge-field action on I1 is taken to be the Wilson action\norb\nSW\n[U] =\n\n\u03b2 X\nw(p) tr {1 \u2212 U(p)},\n2N p\n9\n\n(3.2)\n\n\fwhere the sum runs over all oriented plaquettes U(p) in I1 . The weight w(p) is 1/2 if p is\na plaquette in the (\u03bc\u03bd) planes at n5 = 0 and n5 = N5 , and 1 in all other cases. Dirichlet\nboundary conditions are imposed on the gauge links\nU(n, \u03bc) = g U(n, \u03bc) g \u22121\n\nat n5 = 0 and n5 = N5 .\n\n(3.3)\n\nThe gauge variables at the boundaries are not fixed but are restricted to the subgroup of\nSU(N), invariant under Tg . The Wilson action together with these boundary conditions\nreproduce the correct naive continuum gauge action and boundary conditions on the\ncomponents of the five-dimensional gauge potential [17]. For example, for SU(2), A3\u03bc\n(\"photon\") and A1,2\n(\"Higgs\") satisfy Neumann boundary conditions and A\u03bc1,2 and A35\n5\nDirichlet ones.\nOne of the main results of [17] was to show, through a geometrical construction, that\nthe orbifold projection equation Eq. (3.1) implies the absence of a boundary counterterm\nfor the Higgs mass. Given the explicit breaking of the gauge invariance at the boundaries, a\nboundary mass term for A5 is invariant under the unbroken gauge group. In the continuum\nthis mass term would be tr{[A5 , g][A5 , g \u22121]} evaluated at the boundaries x5 = 0 and\nx5 = \u03c0R. If present, such a term would imply a quadratic sensitivity of the Higgs mass to\nthe cut-off. For the lattice action Eq. (3.2) this would require to add a boundary action\nterm with an additional coefficient \u03bc\u0303. As the lattice spacing a changes, a fine tuning of \u03bc\u0303\nwould be required to keep the Higgs mass finite. Fortunately this term is absent and the\norbifold action is simply Eq. (3.2). Since five-dimensional theories are non-renormalizable,\nthey make sense only as effective theories for energy scales much below the cut-off. On\nthe lattice this is the Symanzik effective action [41, 42, 43, 44], a continuum action which\nis a systematic expansion in the lattice spacing a. For the orbifold theory the Symanzik\neffective action is [17]\n\u0014Z\n1\nd5 z tr{FM N FM N }\nS = \u2212 2\n2g5\nZ\nZ\n4\n+ab1\nd x Re tr{gFM N FM N } + ab2\nd4 x Re tr{gFM N gFM N }\nz={0,\u03c0R}\nz={0,\u03c0R}\n\u0015\nZ\n+a2 c d5 z tr{DL FM N DL FM N } + . . . ,\n(3.4)\n\nwhere FM N is the field strength tensor, DL its covariant derivative and the coefficients\nb1 , b2 , c, . . . are computable in perturbation theory. At 1-loop, b1 6= 0 and b2 = 0 [11]. A\nboundary mass term for the Higgs would appear with a coefficient \u03bc\u0303/a2 .\n3.1\n\nOperators for the Higgs\n\nIf the fifth dimension were infinite, the gauge links U(n, 5) would be gauge-equivalent\nto the identity, which corresponds to the continuum axial gauge A5 \u2261 0.

Being anti-Hermitian, the field (A5 )lat can\nbe represented using the unit matrix and the Hermitian generators T A of SU(N):\nA\n(A5 )lat = \u2212ig0 (A05 1N + AA\n5 T ).\n\n(3.9)\n\nIn order to construct the Higgs field on S 1 /Z2 we have to project7 (A5 )lat onto the components A\u00e25 for which g T \u00e2 g \u22121 = \u2212T \u00e2 (the other generators have g T a g \u22121 = T a ).

In the special\ncase of gauge group SU(2) only a U(1) gauge symmetry survives at the boundaries. If\nwe parameterize the U(1) boundary gauge transformations by \u03a9(n\u03bc , 0) = exp{i\u03c9(n\u03bc )\u03c3 3 },\nthe Higgs field transforms as\n!\n!\n2i\u03c9\n0\nh = \u03c61 \u2212 i\u03c62\n0\ne h\n\u03a6 =\n\u2212\u2192\n.\n(3.12)\n\u2020\n\u22122i\u03c9 \u2020\nh = \u03c61 + i\u03c62\n0\ne\nh\n0\nshowing that it has charge 2 under the U(1) gauge group.\nSince tr{\u03a6} = 0, in order to extract the Higgs mass we define\n\u0010 a \u00113 X\ntr{\u03a6(n\u03bc ) \u03a6\u2020 (n\u03bc )}\nH(n0 ) =\nL n ,n ,n\n1\n\n2\n\n(3.13)\n\n3\n\nand build the connected correlation\naX\n{hH(n0) H(n0 + t/a)i \u2212 hH(n0 )i hH(n0 + t/a)i}\nC(t) =\nT n\n\n(3.14)\n\n0\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\n\u2212\u2192 const. \u00d7 e\u2212mh t ,\n\nand the Higgs mass mh can be extracted from the effective masses amh,eff (t + a/2) =\nln{C(t)/C(t + a)}.

Furthermore, \u2206C is essentially independent of t.

(3.14) suffers from a loss of significance in\nnumerical simulation. This is the, unfortunately, common problem of signals, which are\nexponentially small in the time t, with an almost constant variance, and hence constant\nstatistical error. The ratio of the signal to the error falls off exponentially in the time t; in\nthe large-t region, where the leading exponential decay Eq. (3.15) due to the Higgs mass\nshould be seen, the signal is lost. This is reflected in the exponentially growing error of\nthe effective masses Eq. (3.18).\nTo cure this problem we employ the variational technique of [45]. A basis of Higgs\noperators is constructed and the best operator to capture the Higgs mass in Eq. (3.15),\ni.e. whose overlap with the eigenstate of the Hamiltonian is the largest, will be a linear\ncombination of these basis fields. If the contributions from excited states are suppressed\nthen the leading exponential Eq. (3.15) can be extracted at smaller values of t, where the\nsignal might not be lost.\nHere we sketch how this works; more details can be found in [45]. We construct a\nset of Euclidean fields Oi , i = 1, . . . , r with the same quantum numbers as H \u2261 O1 in\nEq. (3.13). Then we build the matrix correlation function\nCij (t) = hOi (t)Oj (0)\u2217 i \u2212 hOi (t)i hOj (0)\u2217 i ,\n\n(3.19)\n\nand write the spectral decompositions\n1 X \u2212En T \u2212t(Em \u2212En ) (i) (j) \u2217\ne\nAnm Anm\nZ m,n\n1 X \u2212En T (i)\nhOi (t)i =\ne\nAnn ,\nZ n\n\nhOi (t)Oj (0)\u2217 i =\n\n(3.20)\n(3.21)\n\nwhere\nZ =\n\nX\nn\n\ne\u2212En T and A(i)\nmn = hm|Oi (0)|ni .\n\n(3.22)\n\nHere m, n = 0, 1, 2, ... label the eigenstates |mi with energy eigenvalue Em of the Hamiltonian H and T is the temporal size of the lattice. We use the same symbol Oi to denote\nthe Euclidean field and the corresponding operator in the Hamiltonian formulation.\n13\n\n\fThere are two effects, which derive from the finiteness of T and the periodic boundary\nconditions in time (which imply taking the overall trace in the spectral decomposition)\n[46]. Firstly, if the operators Oi have a non-vanishing expectation value the connected\ncorrelation functions Eq. (3.19) have in general t-independent contributions\nh\nih\ni\u2217\n(i)\n(i)\n(j)\n(j)\ne\u2212mh T A00 \u2212 A11 A00 \u2212 A11 ,\n(3.23)\nwhere mh = E1 \u2212 E0 is the mass gap, i.e. the Higgs ground state mass.\n\nSecondly, in the limit that T , t are both large and the difference T \u2212 t is close to t,\nthe matrix correlation function Eq. (3.19) has the leading behavior\nCij (t) \u2212\u2192\n\nX\u0002\n\u0003 (i) (j) \u2217\ne\u2212(En \u2212E0 )t + e\u2212(En \u2212E0 )(T \u2212t) An0 An0 +\nn>0\n\nX\n\n(j) \u2217\ne\u2212(En \u2212E0 )T \u2212(Em \u2212En )t A(i)\nnm Anm .\n\n(3.24)\n\nm,n>0\n\nHere we have assumed that Amn = A\u2217nm and Cij (t) is real, which is true if the operators\nOi are Hermitian. If we take t = T /2, the contribution of the second term in Eq. (3.24)\ngoes like exp{\u2212[(En + Em )/2 \u2212 E0 ]T } compared to exp{\u2212(En \u2212 E0 )T /2} of the first term.\nThe second term is hence subleading and can be neglected.

One expects that c\u03b1 \u2243 et0 W\u03b1 and that\nthe coefficients of the correction terms in Eq. (3.28), because of the excited states, are\nsuppressed.

The starting point is Eq. (3.25). If we say that \u03bb\u2032\u03b1 (t, t0 ) solves the\ngeneralized eigenvalue problem Eq. (3.27) for the matrix C \u2032 defined in Eq.

(3.13), can be constructed by\nmodifying the definition of the Higgs field \u03a6 to create a set of fields \u03a6i . We can for\nexample consider displaced Polyakov lines on S 1 /Z2 as shown in Fig. 3. The position\nwhere the displacement in one of the spatial directions k = 1, 2, 3 takes place can be\nvaried along the extra coordinate n5 = 0, 1, . . . , \u230aN5 /2\u230b. The displacements at the other\nn5 values are equivalent by symmetry with respect to reflection n5 \u2212\u2192 N5 \u2212 n5 . For the\ndisplacement at n5 = 0 Eq. (3.7) is replaced by\n1 X\nU(n\u03bc , n\u2032\u03bc )|n5 =0 l(n\u2032\u03bc ) U \u2020 (n\u03bc , n\u2032\u03bc )|n5 =N5 g l\u2020 (n\u03bc ) g \u22121 , (3.34)\nP (0) (n\u03bc ) =\n6\n\u2032\nn0 =n0\n\n|n\u2212n\u2032 |=a\n\n15\n\n\fand similar expressions P (n5 ) for n5 = 1, . . . , \u230aN5 /2\u230b. In Eq. (3.34) U(n\u03bc , n\u2032\u03bc ) is the parallel\ntransporter from the four-dimensional point n\u2032\u03bc to n\u03bc in the indicated slice n5 in the extra\ndimension.\nYet another possibility to create fields for the variational basis is to consider smeared\nHiggs fields. The simplest is shown in Fig. 4: the field \u03a6(n\u03bc ) (represented by a thick\npoint) is replaced by a smeared field \u03a6\u2032 (n\u03bc ) made of a linear combination of \u03a6(n\u03bc ) and\nthe nearest neighbour fields in the three dimensional space\n\u03a6\u2032 (n\u03bc ) = (1 \u2212 \u03b1) \u03a6(n\u03bc ) +\n\n\u03b1\n6\n\nX\n\nU(n\u03bc , n\u2032\u03bc )|n5 =0 \u03a6(n\u2032\u03bc ) U \u2020 (n\u03bc , n\u2032\u03bc )|n5 =0 . (3.35)\n\nn0 =n\u2032\n0\n\n|n\u2212n\u2032 |=a\n\nThe smearing parameter is \u03b1. The definition of Eq. (3.35) ensures that \u03a6\u2032 transforms as\n\u03a6 under the gauge transformation in Eq. (3.11). Variants of the smearing technique can\nbe found in [47]. The smearing procedure Eq. (3.35) can be iterated a number of times,\nwhich we take to be 3. We set \u03b1 = 0.7.\nFinally, the gauge links used to construct all the Higgs fields \u03a6i are replaced by smeared\ngauge links. This is a very simple procedure to create extended operators. We have\nimplemented APE smearing [48] for the spatial links, i.e. U(z, k), k = 1, 2, 3 and U(z, 5).\nThe links are decorated with staples in the spatial directions l = 1, 2, 3, clearly with the\nrestriction l 6= k for U(z, k). The smeared link U \u2032 is obtained by adding to (1 \u2212 \u03b1)U\nthe sum of the decorating staples multiplied by \u03b1/(number of staples), where \u03b1 is the\nsmearing parameter. The smeared link is projected back onto SU(2). The smearing of\nthe gauge links is iterated 3 times with \u03b1 = 0.75.\n\nl\ng \u22121\n\ng\nl+\nx 5= \u03c0 R\n\nx 5= 0\n\nFigure 3:\n\nThe displaced Polyakov line L on S 1 /Z2 .\n\n16\n\n\fFigure 4:\n\n3.2\n\nA smearing procedure for the Higgs field \u03a6.\n\nPhoton operators\n\nIn this section we describe the construction of operators in the SU(2) orbifold, which\ncreate the gauge boson (photon) associated with the unbroken U(1) gauge group on the\nboundaries. For each Higgs field \u03a6i constructed as described in Section 3.1.2 we define\nthe SU(2) valued quantity (in the following we suppress the index i)\n\u03b1(n\u03bc ) = p\n\n\u03a6(n\u03bc )\n.\ndet(\u03a6(n\u03bc ))\n\n(3.36)\n\nWe note that from Eq. (3.10) and g \u2020 = \u2212g (which holds for SU(2)) it follows \u03b1\u2020 = \u2212\u03b1.\nFor the three spatial directions k = 1, 2, 3 we define a \"decorated double link\"\nV (n\u03bc , k) = U(n\u03bc , k) \u03b1(n\u03bc + ak\u0302) U \u2020 (n\u03bc , k) \u03b1(n\u03bc) (no sum over k) ,\n\n(3.37)\n\nwhich transforms like \u03a6 under gauge transformations. In analogy with the definition [35]\nin the standard SU(2) Higgs model, we define an operator for the photon field\nWk (n\u03bc ) = \u2212itr{\u03c3 3 V (n\u03bc , k)} .\nWe will consider this field projected to zero three-dimensional momentum\n\u0010 a \u00113 X\nWk (n0 ) =\nWk (n\u03bc ) .\nL n ,n ,n\n1\n\n2\n\n(3.38)\n\n(3.39)\n\n3\n\nIt is not difficult to show that the operator Wk (n0 ) is real, invariant under the group\nconjugation Tg and odd under the three-dimensional parity transformation. In order to\nstudy the naive continuum limit, we define a continuum gauge potential at the boundaries\nthrough\nU(x, k) = eaAk (x) = 12 + aAk (x) + O(a2 ) ,\n\n(3.40)\n\nwhere Ak = \u2212ig0 A3k \u03c33 . Here we use the continuum notation to label the lattice points,\nx\u03bc = n\u03bc a. Using the definition of lattice derivative \u03b1(x + ak\u0302) = \u03b1(x) + a\u2202k \u03b1(x) and the\nproperties \u03b1(x)2 = \u221212 and {Ak (x), \u03b1(x)} = 0 we get up to O(a2 ) corrections\nWk (x) = iatr{\u03c33 \u03b1(x) [\u2202k + 2Ak (x)] \u03b1(x)} .\n{z\n}\n|\nDk\n17\n\n(3.41)\n\n\fConsistently with Eq. (3.12) the covariant derivative Dk has a charge 2 in front of Ak . In\nsummary, in the naive continuum limit Wk (x) corresponds to a covariant derivative term\nfor the Higgs field and is hence a vector in the representation of spin 1.\nThe photon mass can be extracted as follows: for each Higgs field \u03a6i in the variational basis discussed above we construct using Eq. (3.38) the corresponding photon field\n(i)\nWk (n0 ). Then we build the matrix of connected correlation functions\n(*\n+\nX\nX (i)\na\n1\n(j)\nWk (n0 + t/a)Wk (n0 )\nCijW (t) =\n3 k\nT n\n0\n*\n+*\n+)\na X (i)\na X (j)\n\u2212\nWk (n0 )\nWk (n0 )\n.\n(3.42)\nT n\nT n\n0\n\n0\n\n(i)\n\nThe expectation value of Wk (n0 ) is zero on average, nevertheless it is subtracted to\npossibly reduce the statistical noise. The matrix CijW (t) is treated as its counterpart for\nthe Higgs to finally get the masses.\n3.3\n\nThe static quark potential\n\nWe measure the potential between a static quark and a static antiquark placed in the\nfour-dimensional slices as we vary the location n5 = 0, 1, . . . , \u230aN5 /2\u230b of the slice. The\npotential is extracted from the expectation values of the traces of rectangular Wilson\nloops W (t, r) of size r in three-dimensional space and t in time direction. The Wilson\nloops are averaged over the three spatial directions and smeared gauge links, constructed\nlike it is explained in Section 3.1.2, are used for the spatial Wilson lines. The potential\nV (r) is then defined as the plateau value at large time t of the effective masses\n\u0013\n\u0012\ntr{W (r, t)}\n.\n(3.43)\naVeff (r, t + a/2) = ln\ntr{W (r, t + a)}\nIn the boundary slices of the orbifold the gauge links belong to gauge group U(1), whereas\nin the bulk slices they are SU(2) gauge links. Since the links on the boundary are \"colder\"\n(i.e. the boundary four-dimensional plaquettes have a larger value) [22], the potential\nturns out to be more precise on the boundary. Also, as the value of N5 is increased, the\nstatistical errors on the potential also increase. This calls for improving the extraction of\nthe potential and there are methods to do this.\n\n4\n\nNumerical results\n\nWe present detailed simulation results of the SU(2) gauge theory on the orbifold.

The plot on the left hand side\nshows the behaviour of vacuum expectations values htr{\u03a6\u2020 \u03a6}i for different Higgs fields.\nThe plot on the right hand side shows a metastability in the Polyakov line in one of the\nthree-dimensional directions right at the phase transition \u03b2c = 1.5975.\nspace size is L/a = 8 and the temporal size is T /a = 96. The large value of the latter\nwas necessary in order to extract reliably the Higgs mass, which turns out to be very\nclose to the 1-loop perturbative value. To check for finite L effects we also performed\nfor some \u03b2 values simulations at L/a = 12. The algorithm is based on SU(2) heatbath\nand overrelaxation updates in the bulk and U(1) heatbath and overrelaxation updates on\nthe boundaries. The statistics of the simulations at L/a = 8 varies between 90'000 and\n260'000 measurements of the observables, at L/a = 12 it is of 32'000 measurements. Each\nmeasurement is separated by one heatbath and L/2a overrelaxation sweeps (i.e. updates\nof all the gauge links).\nWe have also run some simulations to measure the static potential in the four-dimensional\nslices along the extra dimension. For these runs the orbifold geometry was chosen to be\nT /a = 32 and L/a = 16 and we compare the potentials with N5 = 4 and N5 = 6 at\n\u03b2 = 1.609. This \u03b2 value was chosen, since the mass spectrum there resembles more what\nwe expect in a compactification scenario.\n4.1\n\nPhase transition\n\nIn infinite volume or with periodic boundary conditions on a finite torus five-dimensional\nSU(N) gauge theories have at least two phases [49, 50, 36], a confinement massive phase\nat small values of \u03b2 and a deconfinement or Coulomb massless phase at large values of \u03b2.\nFor SU(2) the phase transition is located at \u03b2c = 1.64 [49, 36]. With orbifold boundary\nconditions this phase transition persists but the critical value \u03b2c depends on N5 and on\n19\n\n\fL/a. It is signalled by a jump in the expectation values of plaquettes, see [22]. In Fig. 5\nthe plot on the left hand side shows what happens on the orbifold with N5 = 4 and\nL/a = 8 with vacuum expectation values tr{\u03a6\u03a6\u2020 }, where for \u03a6 we take some of the Higgs\nfields as explained in the legend and in Section 3. There is a clear discontinuity9 in the\nvacuum expectation values at \u03b2c = 1.5975.\nThere is a strong indication that the phase transition is of first order. The plot on\nthe right hand side of Fig. 5 shows the history10 of the expectation value of the Polyakov\nline in one of the three-dimensional space directions evaluated at the boundary n5 = 0 of\nthe orbifold. As it was shown in early Monte Carlo study of SU(2) gauge theory at finite\ntemperature [51,52] the expectation value of the Polyakov line is zero in the confined phase\nand it becomes nonzero in the deconfinement phase, thereby breaking spontaneously a\nZ2 symmetry which changed the sign of the Polyakov line. In finite volume one actually\nobserves in the Monte Carlo history jumps between the Z2 states. Precisely both of these\nbehaviours can be seen on the right hand side of Fig. 5. Until about bin number 400 the\nsystem was in the deconfined phase and then it changes into the confined phase.\nThe location of the phase transition depends not only on N5 but also on the ratio\nL/a/N5 . In principle we would like to be in a situation where N5 \u226a L/a in order to have\na compact extra dimension. But the meaning of compactification will have to be qualified\nby looking at the results for the particle spectrum.\n4.2\n\nHiggs and photon spectra\n\nIn Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 the Higgs and photon masses for the ground state and the first excited\nstate are shown as a function of \u03b2 in units of 1/R for the N5 = 4, L/a = 8 and T /a = 96\norbifold geometry. It was not possible to extract these masses for \u03b2 < \u03b2c = 1.5975. In the\nconfined phase the signal for the effective masses disappears immediately in noise. Right\nabove the phase transition the signal for the particle masses is there.\nThe first observation, looking at Fig. 6, concerns the Higgs ground state mass mh . For\nall \u03b2 > \u03b2c the Higgs mass is consistent with its value computed in 1-loop perturbation\ntheory: for general gauge group G = SU(N) this is\nmh R = \u221a\n\nc\n,\nN5 \u03b2\n\n(4.1)\n\np\nwhere c = 3/(4\u03c0 2) N\u03b6(3)C2 (G)/2 and C2 (G) = N (c = 0.1178 for SU(2)). Here we\nhave taken the continuum result in [11] and replaced the dimensionful coupling g5 by its\nlattice definition Eq. (2.3).\n9\n10\n\nThe expectation value of the basic Higgs field Eq. (3.10) is actually constant for \u03b2 < \u03b2c .\nThe measurements for each simulations are blocked in 500 bins for the error analysis.\n\n20\n\n\f0.8\nground state\nground state 1\u2212loop\n1st excited state\n\n0.7\n0.6\n\nmR (Higgs)\n\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\n2.2\n\n\u03b2\n\n2.4\n\n2.6\n\n2.8\n\n3\n\nFigure 6:\n\nThe ground and first excited state of the Higgs.

The excited state of the Higgs\ncould not be determined at L/a = 12.\nThe second observation, looking at Fig. 7, concerns the photon ground state mass\nm\u03b3 . Contrary to the 1-loop prediction [31] the photon mass is non-zero for all \u03b2 > \u03b2c .\nThe photon mass even increases as the phase transition is approached. This means that\nthere is spontaneous symmetry breaking in the pure gauge theory. This is, to our best\nknowledge, the first non-perturbative evidence for the Higgs mechanism11 originating from\nan extra dimension.\nThe third observation, looking at both Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, concerns the excited state\nmasses for the Higgs m\u22c6h and the photon m\u2217\u03b3 . In perturbation theory, the first excited\n(Kaluza\u2013Klein) states are expected to appear split from the ground states by (\u2206m)R = 1,\nthe second with a mass splitting twice that, and so forth. In no range of \u03b2 we see excited\nstates at about 1 in units of 1/R. Close to the phase transition the excited states are\nseparated from the ground state, especially in the case of the photon. Instead for larger\n\u03b2 they get closer in mass to the ground states. This is an indication that at fixed N5 = 4\nthe system behaves more like a compact system close to the phase transition rather than\nfor large \u03b2.\nAt this point one might worry about finite L effects in the particle masses. Especially\nso for the photon mass, since its non-zero value contradicts perturbation theory. In Table 1\nwe offer a comparison at several \u03b2 values of the particle masses between L/a = 8 and\nL/a = 12. One can see that finite L effects are small and in most cases not significant.\nFor sure there is no variation that could be explained with a behaviour m \u221d 1/L which\nis characteristic of finite volume effects.\n11\n\nSpontaneous symmetry breaking in this context goes back to works by Hosotani [6, 7].\n\n22\n\n\f0.43\n0.425\n0.42\n0.415\n\naV(r)\n\n0.41\n0.405\n0.4\n0.395\n\ndata N =4, n =0\n5\n\n0.385\n0.38\n0\n\n5\n\n5d Coulomb\n5d Yukawa\n4d Coulomb\n4d Yukawa\n\n0.39\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nr/a\n\nFigure 8:\n\nThe static potential at \u03b2 = 1.609 and N5 = 4 between static charges on the\nboundary.

Since we know from the results\nin Section 4.2 that the gauge boson associated with the U(1) gauge symmetry on the\nboundary is massive, the physically motivated fits are Yukawa potentials\naV (r) = \u2212c1 exp(\u2212m\u03b3 r)/(r/a) + c0\n\naV (r) = \u2212d1 K1 (m\u03b3 r)/(r/a) + d0\n\nin four dimensions ,\nin five dimensions ,\n\n(4.2)\n(4.3)\n\nwhere c0 , c1 and d0 , d1 are the fit parameters and the photon mass m\u03b3 is the one measured in the simulations.

It is interesting to compare the Yukawa fits with Coulomb fits\naV (r) = \u2212f1 /(r/a) + f0\n\naV (r) = \u2212e1 /(r/a)2 + e0\n\nin four dimensions ,\n\n(4.4)\n\nin five dimensions ,\n\n(4.5)\n\nwhere f0 , f1 and e0 , e1 are the fits parameters.\nIn Fig. 8 we present results from a simulation of the orbifold geometry T /a = 32, L/a =\n16 and N5 = 4. The statistics is of 20'000 measurements of the potential. The photon\nmass is am\u03b3 = 0.108(7) (for the fits we neglect its error), measured in the simulations\ndescribed in Section 4.2. In the fits only the points r/a = 2, . . . , 8 are included.

Besides the five-dimensional fits also a four-dimensional Yukawa fit can\ndescribe the data.\n\n\u03c72 per degree of freedom are listed in Table 2. The four-dimensional fits are excluded\nwhereas the five-dimensional ones are very good.\nThe data at N5 = 4 might suffer from the fact that the ratio between the cut-off and\nthe compactification scale is only R/a = N5 /\u03c0 \u2243 1.3. In Fig. 9 we present results from\na simulation of the orbifold geometry T /a = 32, L/a = 16 and N5 = 6. The statistics\nis of 9'000 measurements of the potential. The photon mass is am\u03b3 = 0.173(18), taken\nfrom a simulation at the same \u03b2 and N5 values but with T /a = 96 and L/a = 12. In\nTable 2 we can compare the \u03c72 per degree of freedom. We see that at N5 = 6 together\nwith the five-dimensional fits also the four-dimensional Yukawa form is a good fit. The\n\n24\n\n\ffour-dimensional Coulomb fit is instead excluded. It should be noted that the errors on\nthe potential data are comparable at both values of N5 .\nWe also measured the static potential in the middle slice at n5 = 2. The results of\nthe fits confirm the conclusions from the fits in the boundary slice at N5 = 4, that is\nthe four-dimensional forms are disfavoured. The \u03c72 values are now about 3 for the fourdimensional forms and 0.3 for the five-dimensional forms. At N5 = 6 the statistical errors\nare too large and all the fits are equally good. As was discussed in Section 3.3 we have\nto improve the measurements of the static potential, especially for the middle slice. It\nis important to have precise data for the latter, since any difference with respect to the\npotential on the boundary might be a hint of localization effects.\n4.4\n\nDiscussion\n\nA certainly surprising feature of these models emerges when we look at the mass spectrum\nitself, measured in R-units. We have seen in Fig. 6 that when the compactification scale\nis lower than the cut-off scale by a fixed gap (i.e. for N5 fixed), the Higgs ground state\nmass is consistent with its 1-loop perturbative value not only at large values of \u03b2 but also\nin the definitely non-perturbative region when \u03b2 is close to its critical value at the phase\ntransition. Moreover also the photon mass has a mild dependence on \u03b2, see Fig. 7. Since\nwe do not have at present any powerful analytical tools to explain these observations, we\nwill keep our discussion at a qualitative level.\nWe would like to argue that one way to interpret this peculiar phenomenon is by a very\nmild cut-off dependence of the five-dimensional bare coupling g52 in the non-perturbative\nregime12 . The generic situation observed in our simulations, as far as the spectrum is\nconcerned, can be translated in an effective field theory language by saying that the\ntheory possesses a region in its parameter space such that any operator of dimension 5 + p\nappearing in the effective action and effective operators13 scales as\nZ(g0 , g4 ) (5+p)\nO\n,\n\u039bp\n\n(4.6)\n\nwith Z(g0 , g4) a very slowly varying function of the dimensionless bare couplings g0 =\n\u221a\n\u221a\ng5 \u039b and g4 = g5 / \u03c0R, at least as long as the ratio \u039b/(1/R) is kept fixed. In the orbifold\ntheory, taking the Higgs mass as an example, we recall that a boundary counterterm is\nnon-perturbatively excluded and thus all possible corrections come from either pure bulk\n12\n\nNote that this is not in contradiction with the perturbative, 1-loop expectation which wants the\nfive-dimensional bare coupling to have a mild cut-off dependence for energy scales E \u2243 1/R where the\ntheory is truly five-dimensional (see eq. (3.13) of [53]).\n13\nThis is Symanzik's analysis of cut-off effects.\n\n25\n\n\feffects or bulk effects with boundary insertions, both of which descend directly from the\ncircle.\nIn an attempt to predict the explicit cut-off dependence in Eq. (4.6), we note that naive\ndimensional analysis tells us that as \u03b2 decreases with g5 fixed, the cut-off increases, see\nEq. (2.3). The compactification scale is 1/R and a wide separation from the cut-off scale\nrequires \u039b >> 1/R. Increasing \u03b2 while keeping the gap between the compactification\nand cut-off scales fixed, would require decreasing \u039b (at fixed g5 ) and therefore an increase\nof R, which drives the fifth dimension to its decompactification limit. A general lesson\nthen is that for fixed N5 , moving towards the large \u03b2 regime is expected to enhance the\ncut-off effects (appearing as E/\u039b at low energies E in the sense of an effective action) and\ndecompactify the theory, whereas moving in the opposite direction, i.e. towards smaller\n\u03b2, is expected to suppress the cut-off effects and drive the system into a compactified but\nnon-perturbative regime. Eventually the phase transition is reached at the critical value\nof \u03b2 = \u03b2c , where the cut-off reaches its maximal value. There is a possible caveat though\nin this argument: we have implicitly assumed that it makes sense to vary the cut-off while\nkeeping the dimensionful coupling g5 fixed for all values \u03b2c < \u03b2 < \u221e.\nIf we look at the spectrum of the excited states of the Higgs and the photon in Fig. 6\nand Fig. 7, we see that as \u03b2 grows their masses decrease, thus deviating more and more\nfrom their expected perturbative value as Kaluza\u2013Klein states of mass \u2243 1/R. This fact\ncould be explained with our argument that cut-off effects increase at large \u03b2. We cannot\nat the moment explain why these cut-off effects would affect the excited states but not\nthe ground states.\nNext, let us see what happens when we start changing N5 while keeping \u03b2 fixed. The\ncut-off \u039b depends only on \u03b2 and is also fixed. Using Eq. (2.2) we obtain that\n\u03b4R\n\u03b4N5\n=\nN5\nR\n\n(4.7)\n\nwhich implies that increasing N5 amounts to increasing also R. Thus, in a compactified\nscenario we expect to be able to approach an effective dimensional reduction by decreasing\nN5 . It is interesting to note that according to our potential data we observe an opposite\neffect: the fit to a four dimensional Yukawa law becomes much better when we increase\nN5 from 4 to 6 at fixed \u03b2, namely when we decompactify the extra dimension. Therefore,\nto the extent that this result can be considered as a firm physical property of the system\nin this region of the parameter space, we are lead to the conclusion that the fact that\nwe start observing an effective dimensional reduction at N5 = 6 is more likely to be a\nconsequence of a localization mechanism rather than an effect of compactification. It is\npossible that the region that corresponds to dimensional reduction from compactification\nis located at much smaller N5 which would however require an anisotropic lattice to be\n26\n\n\fprobed.\nFinally, regarding the applicability of the vicinity of the phase transition in model\nbuilding, we would like to point out that even though it clearly corresponds to a strong\ncoupling regime from the point of view of five dimensions, viewed from the point of view of\nthe four-dimensional effective theory with an effective coupling defined as in Eq. (2.4), it\ncould correspond to a weakly coupled regime, if for example large renormalization factors\nchange Eq. (2.4).\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nThe first results for the spectrum of the orbifold theory simulated on a lattice with an\nextra dimension of the size of N5 = 4 lattice spacings, show that there is spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking, which manifests in a massive gauge boson associated with the U(1)\nboundary gauge group. This result was unexpected from computations at 1-loop in perturbation theory, where the photon remains massless. Moreover, the Higgs mass is also\nmeasured in a large range of gauge coupling and it is always close to its perturbative\nvalue. The excited state masses for the Higgs and the photon are not at the scale of the\ninverse compactification radius, where they are expected to be in a scenario of dimensional\nreduction like in finite temperature field theory. But close to the orbifold phase transition\nthe mass splitting between the ground states and the first excited states increases. Data\nfor the static potential strongly suggest five-dimensional potential forms, both when the\nstatic potential is measured with the charges on the boundary slice or in the middle slice\nalong the extra dimension. We have also presented potential data at N5 = 6. They\nindicate that a four-dimensional Yukawa form, with the vector boson mass equal to the\nmeasured photon mass, is a good fit to the potential on the boundary together with the\nfive-dimensional forms.\nThe results we have so far give a consistent picture and they motivate for further work\nto explore the phase diagram of the orbifold theory. Despite its non-renormalizability,\nthe theory makes finite predictions for the mass spectrum and we would like to understand better how to change the lattice parameters to study the scaling properties. This\nalso requires technical improvements, for the basis of Higgs operators and for the static\npotential.\nAcknowledgement. We thank B.

To be more concrete, let us\nlook at an example. Consider a 5D SU(2) gauge theory compactified on the circle. In\norder to compute the vacuum energy, according to eq. (A.14) the only quantity we need\nto compute are the aA .

To\n32\n\n\fshow this statement, we can compute the Wilson line due to the vev H =\nalong the T A direction:\nhW i = Pe\u2212ig5\n\nH\n\ndx5 H T A\n\n1\ng5 R\n\nA\n\n= e\u22122\u03c0iT .\n\nof a scalar\n\n(A.32)\n\nIt is straightforward to show that exp(\u22122\u03c0iT A ) is a diagonal matrix. In the case of SU(2):\nexp(\u2212i\u03c0\u03c31 ) = \u221212 = exp(\u2212i\u03c0\u03c32 ). For SU(N), the non-diagonal generators are obtained\nembedding \u03c31,2 . Thus, we always have that\n[hW i, Hi ] = 0,\n\n(A.33)\n\nwhere Hi are the generators corresponding to the Cartan subalgebra of G, i.e. that the\nWilson loop commutes with at least those generators and therefore it leaves at least a\nU(1)1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 U(1)rank(H) unbroken. From this it is clear that in the SU(2) model, U(1)\ncan not break further with \u03b1 = 1. For the SU(3) model \u03b1 = 1 could break SU(2) \u00d7 U(1)\ndown to U(1) \u00d7 U(1) by the Hosotani mechanism. In both cases, it is not clear what\n\u03b1 6= 1 would do.\n\nB\n\nThe Yukawa potential in 5D\n\nThe potential is given by the integral\nV (x) =\n\nZ\n\nd4 q eiq*x\n(2\u03c0)4 q 2 + m2\n\n(B.1)\n\nwhere |x| = r, q = |q|q \u2032, |q \u2032 | = 1 and\nq1\u2032 = cos \u03c61\nq2\u2032 = sin \u03c61 cos \u03c62\nq3\u2032 = sin \u03c61 sin \u03c62 cos \u03b8\nq4\u2032 = sin \u03c61 sin \u03c62 sin \u03b8\n\n(B.2)\n\nwhere 0 \u2264 \u03c6j \u2264 \u03c0, 0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 2\u03c0. Then the potential can be written as\n1\nV (x) =\n(2\u03c0)4\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nd|q||q|\n0\n\n3\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\nd\u03b8\n0\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0\n\nd\u03c61\n0\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u03c0\n\neiq*x\n.\nd\u03c62 sin \u03c61 sin \u03c62 2\nq + m2\n2\n\n(B.3)\n\nChoosing coordinates such that x = r * e1 with e1 a unit vector, we have that q * x =\n|q|r cos \u03c61 and then\nZ \u221e\nZ 2\u03c0 Z \u03c0\nZ \u03c0\n|q|3\n1\nd|q| 2\nd\u03b8\nd\u03c62 sin \u03c62\nd\u03c61 sin2 \u03c61 ei|q|r cos \u03c61 .
