INTRODUCTION\n\nReheating is a crucial ingredient of inflationary cosmology [1]. In most models of inflation,\nthe quasi-exponential expansion leaves the universe very cold and empty, with energy stored\nin coherent oscillations of the inflaton field. Some kind of nonlinear process is required to\nconvert that energy into energy of ordinary particles.\nProducts of the inflaton decay (which will be denoted as \u03c7 but in general will include\nthe short-wave fluctuations of the inflaton field itself) can cause metric perturbations in a\nvariety of ways. Two possible processes are represented by diagrams of Fig. 1. In the first\nprocess, \u03c7 fluctuations scatter off the inflaton's homogeneous component (which is still large\nat that time), thereby producing inflaton fluctuations, which in turn cause perturbations of\nthe metric. In the second process, \u03c7 fluctuations drive the metric perturbations directly.\nWe want to stress that the processes shown in the diagrams are quite generic and exist\nregardless of the particular mechanism of reheating. They exist even if the inflaton only\ndecays perturbatively, although the scattering process of Fig. 1a is absent from the earlydays perturbative treatment [2], in which the decay is represented by an effective friction\nterm in the equation of motion for the inflaton field \u03c6. Fig. 1a corresponds to a driving force\nin the equation of motion for \u03c6 that may allow fluctuations of \u03c6 to reach values \u03b4\u03c6 \u223c \u03c6.\nThe question remains of course (which we will address in this paper) what portion of this\nlarge fluctuation resides in super-Hubble modes, in particular those relevant to structure\nformation.\nRecent progress in the theory of reheating came after recognition that in many inflationary models the early stages of reheating can be studied rather completely. These are\nmodels where reheating starts by a parametric resonance [3,4]. Parametrically amplified\nfluctuations are almost classical, and nonlinear effects can be explored numerically in the\nclassical approximation [5]. It was found that in many cases the resonant stage is followed\nby a stage (called semiclassical thermalization), during which nonlinear interactions of fluctuations become increasingly important, and power spectra of the fields eventually become\nsmooth [5\u20137]. Importance of the scattering process of Fig. 1a was recognized early on in\nlattice studies in rigid spacetimes [5], and since then the estimate \u03b4\u03c6 \u223c (0.1\u20131)\u03c6 has been\nconfirmed for a number of models [7\u201310].\nMeanwhile, applications of the linear theory of metric perturbations to a special type\nof models have shown that in principle also super-Hubble modes, which necessarily activate gravity, can undergo growth at reheating [11\u201314]. It is therefore became important to\ncombine the two lines of research and see if a similar super-Hubble growth can occur due\nto nonlinear effects. The first attempts is that direction were made by studies in restricted\ngeometries: planar geometry in Ref. [15] and spherical symmetry in Ref. [16]. Both studies\nhave indeed found such a growth [15,16].\nThe main purpose of the present paper is to supply an analytical counterpart to the\nnumerical method of Ref. [16]. Although our approximate method, which we call quasilinear\ntheory, cannot describe the fully nonlinear stage of the evolution, it allows us to describe\nthe relevant nonlinear effects at earlier times, when the nonlinearity is still weak. This\nmethod retains linear terms in fluctuations of \u03c6 and the metric and quadratic terms in \u03c7.\nIt generalizes the method developed in Refs. [7,10] for rigid spacetimes to the case when\nmetric perturbations are present. In particular, it will allow us to take into account the\n2\n\n\fprocesses shown in Fig. 1, which are not included in the standard linear theory of metric\nperturbations. (In this paper, we consider the case when the expectation value of \u03c7 is\ninitially zero, so these nonlinear effects are the leading effects of \u03c7.)\nThe system of spherically-symmetric equations is written down in Sect. II. In Sect.\nIII, we construct the quasilinear theory, restricting our attention to a model with a quartic\ninflaton potential. Within the quasilinear theory, we identify two potential sources of metric\nperturbations at super-Hubble scales. The first is the \"erosion\" of the inflaton by \u03c7 fluctuations, as shown in Fig. 1a; the second, is the metric perturbations caused by the anisotropic\nstress, a purely relativistic effect that can be viewed as a part of Fig. 1b. In the subsequent\nsections we analyze these effects in turn. We find that unless the decay products themselves\nhave infrared-singular spectra the \"erosion\" is not infrared singular and thus cannot be important on scales relevant to structure formation. On the other hand, the anisotropic stress\ngives rise to long-range (secular) terms in the gravitational potentials and is important at\nlarge scales, in a calculation restricted to spherical symmetry. In the concluding Sect. VIII,\nwe discuss the overall physical picture that emerges when we try to promote our findings to\nthe full three dimensions.\nII. GRAVITATING SCALAR FIELDS IN SPHERICAL SYMMETRY\n\nEarly on in reheating, the particle density is small, and a weakly interacting particle\nspecies has a very large mean-free path. For such a species, a spherically-symmetric field\nwill be relatively stable with respect to fragmentation into higher partial waves. This means\nthat the restriction to spherical symmetry, when it is desired or unavoidable, can be imposed\ndirectly on the fields (and the metric), rather than on compound quantities, such as the stress\ntensor. In this sense, our calculations will be quite different from those with sphericallysymmetric fluids: in the latter case particles move in all directions; it is only the large-scale\nmotion of the fluid that is radial. In our case, because of the large mean-free paths, the fluid\napproximation is not readily available.\nWe consider a system of scalar fields minimally coupled to gravity and described by the\nLagrangian\nS=\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\nd4 x \u2212g\n\n\"\n\n1X\nR\n\u2212\ng\u03bc\u03bd \u2202 \u03bc \u03c6i \u2202 \u03bd \u03c6i \u2212 V\n2\u03ba2 2 i\n\n#\n\n(1)\n\nwhere i labels different fields, \u03ba2 = 8\u03c0G, and V = V (\u03c6i ) is the potential which can depend\non all of them. The most general spherically symmetric metric is\nds2 = (\u2212N 2 + \u03c8 4 \u03b2 2 )dt2 + 2\u03c8 4 \u03b2dtdr + \u03c8 4 dr 2 + \u03b12 r 2 d\u03a92\n\n(2)\n\nwhere d\u03a92 is the line element of the 2-sphere and all the four functions N, \u03c8, \u03b1, \u03b2 depend on\nt and r. We shall work in isotropic coordinates [17] (\u03b12 = \u03c8 4 ). Accordingly we shall have\nonly one conjugate variable to \u03c8 by a diagonal gauge in which the shift vector \u03b2 is set to\nzero: in this way the extrinsic curvature will be determined only by its trace [17]. Therefore\nthe metric we shall use is the following\nh\n\ni\n\nds2 = \u2212N 2 (t, r)dt2 + \u03c8 4 (t, r) dr 2 + r 2 d\u03a92 .\n3\n\n(3)\n\n\fThe equation of motion for a scalar field with a generic potential V (\u03c6)\n\u2212 \u2207\u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03c6i +\n\n\u2202V\n=0\n\u2202\u03c6i\n\n(4)\n\nare written in a Hamiltonian form for the metric (3)\n\u03c6\u0307i = N\n\u03c0\u0307i =\n\n\u03c0i\n\u03c86\n\n(5)\n\n\u0011\n1 \u0010 2 2\n\u2202V\n\u2032 \u2032\nr\n\u03c8\nN\u03c6\n\u2212 N\u03c8 6\ni\n2\nr\n\u2202\u03c6i\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03c6, \u03c0i are the pair of conjugate variables for the scalar field, a dot denotes the derivative\nwith respect to t whereas a prime denotes the derivative with respect to r.\nThe Hamiltonian equations for the metric are the following:\nN\u03c8\nK\n6\nK\u0307\nK2\n\u03c8\u2032\n=\n\u22126 5\nN\n2\n\u03c8\n\u03c8\u0307 = \u2212\n\n(7)\n!\n\nN\u2032\n\u03c8\u2032 1\n\u22123\n+\n\u03c8\nr\nN\u03c8 4\n\n\u03c8\u2032\n1\n+2\nr\n\u03c8\n\n!\n\n3\n+ \u03ba2 E \u2212 3\u03ba2 V\n2\n\n(8)\n\nwhere K is the trace of the extrinsic curvature and E is the total Hamiltonian for the scalar\nfields\nE=\n\nX\ni\n\n\u03c6i \u20322\n\u03c0i2\n+\n2\u03c8 12 2\u03c8 4\n\n!\n\n+V .\n\n(9)\n\nThe equation for the lapse function N does not involve time derivatives (since N is not a\ndynamical degree of freedom):\nr\u03c8 4\nN\n\nN\u2032\nr\u03c8 4\n\n!\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03c8 \u20322 2r\n\u22126 2 +\n\u03c8\n\u03c8\n\n\u03c8\u2032\nr\n\n!\n\n\u2032\n\n= \u2212\u03ba2\n\nX\n\n\u03c6i \u20322\n\n(10)\n\ni\n\nThe energy and momentum constraints are\n4\nK2\n1 (3)\nR = \u2212 5 \u22072 \u03c8 = \u03ba2 E \u2212\n2\n\u03c8\n3\n2 \u2032 X 2 \u03c0i \u03c6i \u2032\n\u03ba\nK =\n3\n\u03c86\ni\n\"\n\nwhere\n\n(3)\n\n#\n\n(11)\n(12)\n\nR is the curvature of spatial sections.\nIII. QUASILINEAR REGIME\n\nTo describe analytically the phase that follows the linear stage, we employ now a quasilinear approximation, which generalizes the method developed in [7,10] for rigid spacetimes.\nIn this approximation we consider terms that are linear in the fluctuations of the inflaton\nand of the metric, but keep quadratic terms in \u03c7 fluctuations. In the absence of an initial\n4\n\n\fhomogeneous value of \u03c7, these quadratic terms represent the leading effects of \u03c7 on the\ninflaton and the metric functions.\nThe metric at the first order has the same general form as in the linear theory (reviewed\nin Ref. [18]). Including only scalar perturbations but keeping (for now) three-dimensional\ncoordinates, we write it in the longitudinal gauge as\no\n\nn\n\nds2 = a2 (t) \u2212[1 \u2212 2\u03a6(t, x)]dt2 + [1 + 2\u03a8(t, x)]dx2 ;\n\n(13)\n\nt now is the conformal time. An important difference with the linear theory, however, is that\neven for minimally coupled scalars, there is an anisotropic stress, induced by a nonlinear\ncontribution of \u03c7. As a result, \u03a6 6= \u03a8.\nFor definiteness, from now on we consider a model with two fields: the inflaton \u03c6 and\nthe second field \u03c7 whose fluctuations will drive fluctuations of \u03c6 and the metric. Both fields\nare minimally coupled to gravity, and their potential is\n1\n1\n1\nV (\u03c6, \u03c7) = \u03bb\u03c64 + g 2 \u03c62 \u03c72 + \u03bb\u2032 \u03c74 .\n4\n2\n4\n\n(14)\n\nOur method applies equally well to single field models, in which case the role of \u03c7 will be\nplayed by short-scale components of the inflaton itself.\nTo the linear order in metric perturbations, equations for the fields \u03c6 and \u03c7 can be\nobtained without restriction to spherical symmetry. On the other hand, equations for the\nmetric functions we present below are valid only under that restriction.\nExpanding the equation of motion for \u03c6 to the first order in \u03a6, \u03a8, \u03c72 , and the spatial\nderivatives of \u03c6 we obtain\n\u03c6\u0308 + 2H\u03c6\u0307 + \u22072 \u03c6 + \u03bba2 \u03c63 + g 2a2 \u03c6\u03c72 = \u2212\u03c6\u0307(\u03a6\u0307 + 3\u03a8\u0307) + 2\u03bba2 \u03c63 \u03a6 ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere H = \u0227/a; dots denote derivatives with respect to t. We can separate the field \u03c6 into\nits volume average, \u03c60 , and a fluctuation:\n\u03c6(t, x) = \u03c60 (t) + \u03b4\u03c6(t, x) .\n\n(16)\n\nThe volume averages of \u03a6 and \u03a8 are made zero through definitions of the scale factor a and\nthe conformal time. We also assume that the volume average of the field \u03c7 is initially zero.\nSubstituting (16) into (15), expanding to the first order, and averaging over the volume\ngives\n\u03c6\u03080 + 2H\u03c6\u03070 + \u03bba2 \u03c630 + g 2 a2 \u03c60 \u03c72 = 0 ;\n\n(17)\n\nthe overline denotes a volume average. Subtracting (17) from (15), we obtain an equation\nfor the fluctuation:\nh\n\ni\n\n\u03b4 \u03c6\u0308 + 2H\u03b4 \u03c6\u0307 + \u2212\u22072 + 3\u03bba2 \u03c620 \u03b4\u03c6 + g 2 a2 \u03c60 (\u03c72 \u2212 \u03c72 ) = \u2212\u03c6\u03070 (\u03a6\u0307 + 3\u03a8\u0307) + 2\u03bba2 \u03c630 \u03a6 .\n\n(18)\n\nSimilarly, for \u03c7, to the first order in \u03a6, \u03a8, \u03c72 , and \u03b4\u03c6, we obtain\nh\n\ni\n\n\u03c7\u0308 + 2H\u03c7\u0307 + \u2212\u22072 + g 2 a2 \u03c620 \u03c7 = \u22122g 2a2 \u03c60 \u03c7\u03b4\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c7\u0307(\u03a6\u0307 + 3\u03a8\u0307) .\n5\n\n(19)\n\n\fIn this paper, we use quasilinear theory only for the earliest times, when the right-hand\nof (19) can be neglected. In this case, we obtain an equation for \u03c7 which is unaffected by\nmetric perturbations:\ni\n\nh\n\n\u03c7\u0308 + 2H\u03c7\u0307 + \u2212\u22072 + g 2 a2 \u03c620 \u03c7 = 0 .\n\n(20)\n\nIn the full 3d case, the nonlinearities of \u03c7 would act as a source not only for scalar metric\nperturbations, but also for vector and tensor ones. Equations given below are restricted to\nspherical symmetry, in which case only scalar perturbations are present.\nIn the quasilinear approximation, the energy constraint (12) reads\n\u03ba2\n(\u03b4E\u03c6 + \u03b4E\u03c7 )\n(21)\n2\nwhere the fluctuations of energy densities of the fields are defined by \u03b4Ei = Ei \u2212 Ei ; for the\nmodel at hand, to the required order,\n\u2212 \u22072 \u03a8 + 3H(\u03a8\u0307 + H\u03a6) =\n\n\u03b4E\u03c6 = \u03c6\u03070 \u03b4 \u03c6\u0307 + \u03c6\u030720 \u03a6 + a2 \u03bb\u03c630 \u03b4\u03c6 ,\n\u03c7\u03072 (\u2207\u03c7)2 g 2 2 2 2\n+\n+ a \u03c60 \u03c7 .\nE\u03c7 =\n2\n2\n2\nThe momentum constraint (12) reads\n\n(22)\n(23)\n\n\u03ba2\n(\u03c6\u03070 \u03b4\u03c6 \u2032 + \u03c7\u0307\u03c7 \u2032 ) .\n(24)\n2\nWe do not present a quasilinear form for Eq. (8). The quasilinear form for Eq. (10) is:\n(\u03a8\u0307 + H\u03a6) \u2032 = \u2212\n\n(\u03a6 \u2212 \u03a8)\u2032\nr\nr\n\n!\u2032\n\n2\n\n= \u03ba2 \u03c7 \u2032 .\n\n(25)\n\nThe right-hand side is the anisotropic stress.\nIn general, an anisotropic stress is generated by a non-vanishing traceless part of the\nspatial energy-momentum tensor. In our case, it is due to the traceless second-order contribution of the field \u03c7:\n1\n\u03a0ij = \u2202 i \u03c7\u2202j \u03c7 \u2212 \u03b4ji \u2202 l \u03c7\u2202l \u03c7 .\n(26)\n3\nFor small scalar perturbations, the corresponding Einstein equation takes\nh i\n1\n(27)\n(D i Dj \u2212 \u03b4ji D 2 ) [\u03a6 \u2212 \u03a8] = \u03ba2 \u03a0ij ,\nS\n3\nwhere Di is the covariant derivative with respect to the spatial metric \u03b3ij , related to gij via\ngij = \u03c8 4 \u03b3ij , D 2 = D i Di , and the subscript S denotes the scalar part of \u03a0ij . The scalar part\nis automatically selected when we make restriction to spherical symmetry, and the result\ncoincides with Eq. (25).\nWe see that nonlinearities in \u03c7 can potentially cause two types of effects. First, the\nrescattering term-the last term on the right-hand side of (18)-will lead to a growth of \u03b4\u03c6;\nthis is the effect represented by the diagram of Fig. 1. Second, the right-hand side of Eq.\n(25) directly produces \u03a6 \u2212 \u03a8 6= 0. Either way, the resulting perturbations are non-Gaussian.\nIn the remaining sections, we will study these two effects in turn. Note that neither of these\neffects was taken into account in Ref. [19] where only the direct second-order contribution\nof \u03c7 to curvature perturbation was considered (in a different model).\n6\n\n\fIV. INFLATON FLUCTUATIONS\n\nThe two effects described at the end of the previous section are more easily disentangled\nif we use, instead of \u03b4\u03c6, the gauge-invariant variable\nQ\u03c6 = \u03b4\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6\u0307\u03a8/H .\n\n(28)\n\nThis variable was introduced by Mukhanov to characterize perturbations produced during\ninflation [20]; it was applied to studies of reheating at the linear level in Refs. [21,12\u201314].1\nFrom now on we omit the zero subscript on the homogeneous component of \u03c6, hoping that\nthis will not cause any confusion.\nUsing Eq. (18) and the quasilinear equations for the metric, we obtain the following\nequation for Q\u03c6 :\nh\n\ni\n\n2\nQ\u0308\u03c6 + 2HQ\u0307\u03c6 + \u2212\u22072 + 3\u03bba2 \u03c62 + \u03c9GRAV\nQ\u03c6 + g 2a2 \u03c6\u03b4\u03c72 = F (\u03c7) ,\n\n(29)\n\n2\nwhere \u03b4\u03c72 = \u03c72 \u2212 \u03c72 , the gravitational contribution \u03c9GRAV\nto the frequency is\n2\n\u03c9GRAV\n\n\u03c6\u03073\n= \u03ba \u03c6\u0307 2a\n+ 3\u03c6\u0307 \u2212 \u03ba\nH\n2H2\n2\n\n2 V,\u03c6\n\n2\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(30)\n\nand V is the potential of \u03c6; in our case, V,\u03c6 = \u03bb\u03c63 . This potential does not include a Hartree\ncorrection, cf. Eq. (17). Indeed, including such a correction here would take us outside of\nthe quasilinear approximation. Thus, (30) is the standard expression of the linear theory\n[20,18,12]. The force term F (\u03c7) depends only on \u03c7:\n1\n\u03c6\u0307\n1\n1\n\u2212 (\u2207\u03c7)2 \u2212 g 2a2 \u03c62 \u03b4\u03c72 + 2 \u22072 (\u03a6 \u2212 \u03a8)\nH\n3\n2\n3\u03ba\n!\n3\n\u03c6\u0307\nV,\u03c6\n\u2212 \u03ba2 2 Z\u03c7 ,\n\u2212 6\u03c6\u0307 + 2a2\nH\nH\n\nF (\u03c7) = \u03ba2\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(31)\n\nwhere Z\u03c7 is the contribution of \u03c7 to the curvature perturbation, see eqs. (46), (47) below. The term proportional to \u22072 (\u03a6 \u2212 \u03a8) depends only on \u03c7 by virtue of the quasilinear\napproximation, see Eq. (25).\nBecause Eq. (29), unlike Eq. (18), depends on the gravitational potentials only through\n\u22072 (\u03a6 \u2212 \u03a8), the most long-range (secular) contributions to \u03a6 and \u03a8 do not enter, and all\ninteractions generated by gravity in Eq. (29) are suppressed by at least one power of MPl .\n(This suppression is in parallel with the result of Ref. [13] for the linear case.) Neglecting\nall such terms and going over to the variable X = aQ\u03c6 , we obtain\n\u1e8c + (\u2212\u22072 + 3\u03bba2 \u03c62 )X = \u2212g 2 a3 \u03c6(\u03c72 \u2212 \u03c72 ) ,\n1 This\n\n(32)\n\nvariable looks as a combination of metric and field fluctuations in the longitudinal gauge,\nwhile in the uniform curvature gauge its interpretation is more transparent: it is simply the field\nfluctuation, which indeed is the true dynamical variable of the problem (see for example [22]).\n\n7\n\n\fwhere we have neglected the term \u00e4/a in the frequency because a radiation dominated\nuniverse (\u00e4 \u2248 0) is a good approximation during reheating in this model. Eq. (32) shows\nthat, in the quasilinear theory, the growth of X is driven primarily by rescattering due to\nthe local coupling and is essentially unaffected by gravity.\nBy using the spherically symmetric equations for gravity in deriving Eq. (32), we have\nneglected vector and tensor perturbations. It seems plausible, however, that contributions\nof these types of perturbations to the evolution of Q\u03c6 are suppressed in the same way as\nthe contribution of scalar perturbations. We therefore expect that Eq. (32) applies, to the\n\u22121\nleading order in MPl\n, in the full three dimensions. Accordingly, we write it in the Fourier\nspace as\n2\n\n2 2\n\n2 3\n\n\u1e8ck + (k + 3\u03bba \u03c6 )Xk = \u2212g a \u03c6\n\nZ\n\nd3 p\u03c7p (t\u2032 )\u03c7k+p (t\u2032 ) .\n\n(33)\n\nThe solution to Eq. (33) can be written in terms of the Green function:\nXk (t) = Xk,INFL (t) \u2212 g 2\n\nt\n\nZ\n\n0\n\ndt\u2032 Gk (t, t\u2032 )a3 (t\u2032 )\u03c6(t\u2032 )\n\nZ\n\nd3 p\u03c7\u2217p (t\u2032 )\u03c7k+p (t\u2032 ) ,\n\n(34)\n\nwhere Xk,INFL (t) is the solution to the linear problem, corresponding to perturbations produced during inflation and the crossover to reheating. The second, forced, term in Eq. (34)\nstarts from zero at t = 0 but then grows, initially as exp(2\u03bcmax t) where \u03bcmax is the maximal\nFloquet exponent for \u03c7. There is no additional decay in time, since the factor a3 cancels\nthe damping envelope \u223c 1/a of the fields \u03c6, \u03c7.\nThe Green function can be written as\n(0)\n\nGk (t, t\u2032 ) =\n\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\nXk 1 (t\u2032 )Xk 2 (t) \u2212 Xk 1 (t)Xk 2 (t\u2032 )\n,\nWk\n\n(35)\n\n(0)\n\nwhere Xk 1,2 are two independent solutions to the homogeneous equation\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\n\u1e8ck 1,2 (t) + (k 2 + 3\u03bba2 \u03c62 )Xk 1,2 = 0 ,\n\n(36)\n\nand Wk is their (time independent) Wronskian. The homogeneous solutions are known in\nimplicit form [23] (see also [24]):\n(0)\nXk 1,2 (t)\n\n=\n\n!\nWk Z dt\n|Mk (t)| exp \u00b1\n,\n2\nMk (t)\n\nq\n\n(37)\n\nwhere Mk (t) is defined in Eq. (37) of Ref. [23], and the Wronskian Wk is\ns\n\n8\n9\nWk = k (x4 \u2212 )(3 \u2212 x4 )\n9\n4\n\n(38)\n\n\u221a\nwith x = k/( \u03bb\u03c6(0)).\n\u221a\nThe Wronskian Wk is real in the single resonance band 3/2 < x2 < 3 and imaginary everywhere else. When Wk is imaginary, Wk = i|Wk |, the solutions (37) are complex\nconjugate, and the Green function becomes\n8\n\n\f2 q\n|Wk |\nGk (t, t ) =\n|Mk (t)Mk (t\u2032 )| sin\n|Wk |\n2\n\u2032\n\nZ\n\nt\u2032\n\nt\n\ndt\u2032\u2032\nMk (t\u2032\u2032 )\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(39)\n\nAt small k, |Wk | \u223c k, while Mk (t) is finite and nonzero, so Gk is regular there. Thus, if\nthe field \u03c7 has not been amplified during inflation, the integral over p in Eq. (34) remains\nregular at k = 0 as long as the quasilinear approximation applies.\nUsing Eq. (34), we can estimate the power spectrum of the forced (non-Gaussian) part\nof Q\u03c6 as\nPQ,NG(k) \u223c\n\ng2\n\u03bb\u03c6\n\n!2 Z\n\nd3 pP\u03c7 (p)P\u03c7 (|p + k|) ,\n\n(40)\n\nwhere P\u03c7 is the power spectrum of \u03c7. We should now distinguish two cases.\n< \u03bb, the spectrum of \u03c7 produced at that\n(i) If the field \u03c7 was light during inflation, g 2 \u223c\ntime is infrared singular, which by Eq. (40) gives rise to an infrared-singular spectrum of Q\u03c6 .\nThis will result in non-Gaussian adiabatic perturbations of the metric at scales of relevance\nto structure formation, in addition to the previously considered [25] perturbations due to a\ndirect quadratic contribution of \u03c7 to the energy density.\nFor 1 < g 2/\u03bb < 3, when the infrared part of the spectrum is amplified by parametric\nresonance, this effect can be quite large. It is the largest for g 2 /\u03bb = 2, when the resonance\npeak is centered at k = 0. In this case, assuming for simplicity the exact scale-invariant\nspectra for both \u03c6 and \u03c7 at the end of inflation, we can estimate P\u03c7 as P\u03c7 (k) \u223c h\u03c72 ifull /k 3 ,\nwhere h\u03c72 ifull denotes the full 3d variance. The resulting PQ,NG should be compared to\n2\nthe inflation-produced Gaussian spectrum PQ,INFL \u223c HINFL\n/k 3 , where HINFL is the Hubble\nparameter during inflation. Using the maximal value of the variance h\u03c72 ifull \u223c \u03bb\u03c62 /g 2 [7,8],\nwe obtain\nPQ,NG\n\u223c\nPQ,INFL\n\ng2\n\u03bb\u03c6\n\n!2\n\nh\u03c72 i2full\n\u03c62\n\u223c\n\u223c 106 .\n2\n2\nHINFL\nHINFL\n\n(41)\n\n(A similar, but Gaussian, effect is obtained in linear theory in certain models with a nonvanishing homogeneous component of \u03c7 [13,14].)\n(ii) If the field \u03c7 was heavy during inflation, it arrives at reheating with a constant\n(white-noise) spectrum at small k, and by Eq. (40) the spectrum of Q\u03c6 is also constant\n(\"non-Gaussian white noise\"). Indeed, assuming that the resonance peak is located at\nk = k\u2217 , we estimate that P\u03c7 \u223c h\u03c72 ifull /k\u22173 , where h\u03c72 ifull denotes the full 3d variance.

Since\n1 + w just oscillates between finite values, a growth of the left-hand side of (44) can only\ncome from a growth of \u03b6.\nThe momentum constraint (24), can be generalized to the full three dimensions; the\nresulting scalar part, separated along the lines of Ref. [26], is\n1\n\u03ba2\n\u03c6\u0307\u03b4\u03c6k + 2\n\u03a8\u0307k + H\u03a6k = \u2212\n2\nk\n\u0012\n\nZ\n\n3\n\nd p(k *\n\np)\u03c7\u0307p+k \u03c7\u2217p\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2261\u2212\n\n\u03ba2\n\u03c6\u0307\u03b4\u03c6k \u2212 Z\u03c7 k .\n2\n\n(46)\n\nUsing (46), we can express \u03b6 as\n(1 + w)\u03b6k = \u2212\n\n\u03ba2\n2\n\u03c6\u0307 Q\u03c6 k \u2212\nZ\u03c7 k .\n3H\n3H\n\n(47)\n\nAt small k, we estimate the integral in (46), in case (ii), as\nZ\n\nd3 p(k * p)\u03c7\u0307p+k \u03c7\u2217p \u223c O(k 2 ) ,\n\n(48)\n\nso that the direct contribution of \u03c7 in this case is independent of k in the small-k limit.\nThe same conclusion was reached previously in Ref. [19], albeit for a different model and\nby a different method. However, comparing (47) and (40), we see that at g 2 \u226b \u03bb the\ncontribution from Q\u03c6 , which was not considered in Ref. [19], is parametrically larger than\nthe direct contribution of \u03c7.\nEven that larger contribution is still quite small. Using (43), we obtain\nP\u03b6,NG(k) \u223c\n\n\u03c62\n\u03ba4 \u03c6\u03072 \u03c62\n\u223c\n,\n2 3\nH2 k\u22173\nMPl\nk\u2217\n\n(49)\n\nso that the perturbation of \u03b6 on scales larger than the Hubble scale is\n\u03b4H \u03b6 \u223c\n\n\u03c6\nMPl\n\n\u0012\n\nH\nk\u2217\n\n\u00133/2\n\n\u223c 10\u22126 ,\n\n(50)\n\nwhere we have used \u03c6/MPl \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 and H/k\u2217 \u223c 6 \u00d7 10\u22123 . We doubt that such a small\nperturbation can cause a gravitational instability, such as one observed numerically in Ref.\n[16]. Indeed, in the following sections we will identify a much stronger infrared effect, due\nto anisotropic stress.\nThe form (39) of the Green function leaves open the possibility of \u03b4\u03c6 cascading towards\nthe infrared. Indeed, if the integral in the argument of sine increases with time, the region of\nk where the regular small-k limit applies will be pushed further and further in the infrared.\nHowever, the corresponding growth of the spatial scale of the perturbations can only occur\nat the relevant excitation speed, such as the speed of sound, and so cannot overtake the\ncosmological horizon (which recedes at the speed of light).\n10\n\n\fV. INITIALIZATION OF A RADIAL FIELD\n\nIt is clear from Eq. (25) that to understand the effect of the anisotropic stress, we need\nto understand the spatial profile of the field \u03c7. It is useful to look first at the initial state,\nbecause the profile of \u03c7 remains qualitatively the same throughout the quasilinear stage of\nthe evolution.\nA spherically-symmetric (also called radial) field \u03c7 is initialized according to the formula2\nr\u03c7(r) = A\n\nX\n\nsk kP\u03c71/2 (k) sin kr ,\n\n(51)\n\nk\n\nwhere k are the lattice momenta, quantized in units of \u03c0/R, sk are Gaussian random numbers\nwith zero average and unit dispersion, and P\u03c7 is the power spectrum. The constant coefficient\nA is to be chosen upon deciding what part of the full three-dimensional (3d) variance the\nradial field will account for. The latter question arises because in the full 3d case there surely\nwill be other, nonradial, modes, which will carry a part (in fact, most) of the variance.\nConsider the average of the field defined in (51) over the distribution of the random\nnumbers sk :\nA2 R\nh\u03c7 i(r) = 2\nr \u03c0\n2\n\nZ\n\nkmax\n\nkmin\n\ndkk 2 P\u03c7 (k) sin2 kr ,\n\n(52)\n\nwhere we have replaced the sum with an integral, and kmin and kmax are the minimal and\nmaximal lattice momenta. For a field that was heavy during inflation, we use P\u03c7 (k) corresponding to the adiabatic vacuum, with an additional ultraviolet cutoff:\nP\u03c7 (k) = (2\u03c0)\u22123 (2\u03c9k )\u22121 exp(\u2212k 2 /k02 ) .\n\n(53)\n\nwhere \u03c9k is the instantaneous frequency at t = 0. For this power spectrum, the average (52)\nhas the asymptotic form\nA2 R\nh\u03c7 i(r) \u2248 2\nr 2\u03c0\n2\n\nZ\n\nP\u03c7 (k)k 2 dk\n\n(54)\n\nat large r. On the other hand, the full 3d variance is independent of the coordinates and\nequals\nh\u03c72 ifull = 4\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nP\u03c7 (k)k 2 dk .\n\n(55)\n\nThe field \u03c7 is smooth, almost constant, over a patch of radius r \u226a \u03c0/k0 , where k0 is\nthe ultraviolet cutoff from (53). A smooth field is predominantly an s-wave, so for such r\nwe expect the average (52) to approximately equal the full 3d variance (55). In a sense, the\nscale\n\n2\n\nIn numerical work, after the field \u03c7 has been initialized according to (51) we additionally subtract\naway its homogeneous component. This does not matter for the present argument.\n\n11\n\n\fl0 = \u03c0/k0\n\n(56)\n\ncan be viewed as the initial correlation length of the field. The asymptotic expression (54)\napplies at r \u226b l0 , but as r approaches l0 , we expect h\u03c72 i(r) to approach h\u03c72 ifull . Accordingly,\nwe adopt the following estimate for the magnitude of h\u03c72 i(r) at r \u226b l0 :\nh\u03c72 i(r) = h\u03c72 ifull l20 /r 2 .\n\n(57)\n\nA2 = 8\u03c0 2 l20 /R .\n\n(58)\n\nThis corresponds to\n\nA number of order one could be inserted here, but it has practically no effect on the final\nresults. The important point is that, at a fixed r, Eq. (57) gives the size of fluctuations that\nis independent of the spatial volume. Equivalently, the volume average\n4\u03c0\nV\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nR\n\nr 2 drh\u03c72i(r) =\n\n4\u03c0l20 R 2\nh\u03c7 ifull ,\nV\n\n(59)\n\ndecreases with R as 1/R2 .\nThe 1/r 2 dependence of the variance of a radial field can be simply interpreted as follows.\nFor an observer at the origin, a smooth patch of size l0 at distance r \u226b l0 has angular size\nl0 /r. Thus, expansion of a 3d field with correlation length l0 will require of order (r/l0 )2\ndifferent spherical harmonics, with amplitudes that are roughly of the same order. The\nvariance in each of these partial waves, specifically the s-wave, will then account for (l0 /r)2\nof the full 3d variance. Similar considerations apply to perturbations of the metric.\nIn Ref. [16], in preparation of the initial state, we in effect assumed that the volume\naverages of h\u03c72 i and of the variances of the metric functions, e.g. the left-hand side of (59),\nequaled the full 3d variances. As we now see, that was an overestimate of the size of initial\nfluctuations. However, as typical in problems where amplification of fluctuations is cut off\nby nonlinear effects, the initial size is relatively unimportant: repeating the run of Ref. [16]\nwith initial data of the correct size, we find that the strong gravitational effects, which we\ninterpreted as formation of a black hole, are merely postponed from t \u2248 74 to t \u223c 105 (in\nthe units of Ref. [16]).\nVI. EFFECT OF THE ANISOTROPIC STRESS\n\nWe are now in position to estimate metric perturbations caused by the anisotropic stress.\nConsider Eq. (25) of the quasilinear approximation. As we have seen in the previous section,\nthe initial profile of \u03c7 is a superposition of spherical waves and has a 1/r envelope. This\nform is preserved during the quasilinear stage for as long as Eq. (20) applies. However, the\ncorrelation length of \u03c7 is now determined not by the ultraviolet cutoff, but rather by the\ntypical resonant momentum, k\u2217 :\nl = \u03c0/k\u2217 .\nAccordingly, instead of (57) we now have, at r \u226b l,\n12\n\n(60)\n\n\fh\u03c72 i(r, t) = h\u03c72 ifull (t)l2 (t)/r 2 .\n\n(61)\n\nAveraging Eq. (25) over the distribution of the random initial data and using Eq. (61), we\nobtain\n\"\n\n(h\u03a6i \u2212 h\u03a8i)\u2032\nr\nr\n\n#\u2032\n\n= c\u03ba2\n\nh\u03c72 ifull\n,\nr2\n\n(62)\n\nwhere c > 0 is a weakly time-dependent constant of order one. Two powers of l in Eq. (61)\neat away two spatial derivatives in Eq. (25).\nEq. (62) is easily integrated. Using the boundary conditions (\u03a6 \u2212 \u03a8)(R) = 0, (\u03a6 \u2212\n\u2032\n\u03a8) (R) = 0, we obtain3\nR 1 r 2 \u2212 R2\n1\nh\u03a6i \u2212 h\u03a8i = c\u03ba2 h\u03c72 ifull ln +\n2\nr\n2 R2\n(\n\n)\n\n.\n\n(63)\n\nThus, the average gravitational potentials are more long-ranged than the average of \u03c72 itself,\nEq. (61).\nCombining Eq. (63) with the momentum constraint (24), we can obtain estimates for\nh\u03a6i and h\u03a8i separately, at least for r > l. We will need to integrate Eq. (24) so as to\nremove the spatial derivative. The second term on the right hand side can only lead to a\nshort-range, i.e. 1/r 2 , contribution, while the first term leads to a contribution that is either\nshort-range or suppressed by several powers of MPl . So, for our present purposes we can\ntake\nh\u03a8\u0307i + Hh\u03a6i \u2248 0 .\n\n(64)\n\nIf, as a result of parametric resonance, the field \u03c7 grows with a characteristic exponent \u03bc,\nthe potentials \u03a6 and \u03a8, as (63) and (64) show, grow with characteristic exponent 2\u03bc. Then,\nfrom (64) we see that\nh\u03a8i \u223c\nwhere m0 \u223c\nTherefore,\n\n\u221a\n\nH\nh\u03a6i \u226a h\u03a6i ,\n\u03bcm0\n\n(65)\n\n\u03bb\u03c6(0) is the frequency (in conformal time) of the inflaton's oscillations.\n\nh\u03a6i \u223c\n\nh\u03c72 ifull R\nln ,\n2\nMPl\nl\n\n(66)\n\nand then (65) is an estimate for h\u03a8i. We see that, up to a weak logarithmic factor, the\naverage potentials are independent of R. We stress, however, that these estimates apply\nonly in quasilinear theory.\n\n3\n\nUsing, instead of (\u03a6 \u2212 \u03a8)(R) = 0, the condition of vanishing volume average of \u03a6 \u2212 \u03a8, as in\nSect. III, will only change (63) by an unimportant constant.\n\n13\n\n\fThe approximate volume independence of h\u03a6i and h\u03a8i during the resonant growth of \u03c7 is\nconfirmed by numerical integrations. Integrations were done using the algorithm described\nin Ref. [16] and are fully nonlinear. For example, Fig. 2 shows \u03b4H \u03c8/\u03c8(R) for g 2/\u03bb = 110\nand \u03bb\u2032 = 0. Here \u03c8(R) is the conformal factor at the outer end of the grid, and \u03b4H \u03c8 is\ndefined by\n(\u03b4H \u03c8)2 = 4\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nH\n\nkmin\n\ndkk 2 P\u03c8 (k) ,\n\n(67)\n\nwhere P\u03c8 (k) is the power spectrum of \u03c8 \u2212 \u03c8(R), and kmin is the minimal lattice momentum.\nFourier components of \u03c8 \u2212 \u03c8(R), required for calculation of the power spectrum, are determined via a sine transform. During the resonant growth of \u03c7, the metric functions \u03a6 and\n\u03a8 rapidly become smooth and can therefore be regarded as self-averaging. For this reason,\nthe quantity plotted in Fig. 2 should give a good idea of the typical values of h\u03a8i.\nNumerical values of h\u03a6i and h\u03a8i predicted by the estimates (66) and (65) are quite small.\nThe usual estimate [7,8] for the maximum value of h\u03c72 ifull is\nmaxh\u03c72 ifull \u223c\n\n2\n\u03bb\u03c62\n\u03bb\n10\u22122 MPl\n,\n\u223c\n\u00d7\ng2\ng2\nln2 \u03bb\n\n(68)\n\nso for \u03bb = 10\u221213 and g 2 /\u03bb \u223c 100 we obtain\nh\u03a8i \u226a h\u03a6i \u223c 10\u22127 ln(R/l) .\n\n(69)\n\nFrom Fig. 2, we see that the lattice result by far exceeds the estimate (69), even during the\nstage of exponential growth, which one might want to identify with the quasilinear stage.\nThe reason is that, because of the 1/r 2 form of h\u03c72 i, the quasilinear approximation, strictly\nspeaking, breaks down quite early on-when h\u03c72 i becomes of order (68) at r \u223c l. The\ngrowth of various quantities can still continue, however, because in most of the space h\u03c72 i\nis still much smaller than that. (We discuss this point further in the next section.)\nDuring the entire exponential growth, the two curves corresponding to different box sizes\ncoincide with excellent precision, in agreement with the approximate volume independence\nof h\u03a8i derived analytically. The time when the curves part corresponds to breakdown of the\nquasilinear theory in most of the space. At that time, volume dependence of the results is\nnot surprising: nonlinear gravitational phenomena, such as gravitational collapse, depend\non the total amount of matter available and will be more pronounced in a larger volume.\nVII. FURTHER NONLINEAR EFFECTS\n\nThe driving force due to local scattering in Eq. (18) can be estimated as\ng 2 \u03c6h\u03c72 i \u223c g 2 \u03c6l2 h\u03c72 ifull /r 2 .\n\n(70)\n\nFluctuation of \u03c6 caused by this driving force at r \u223c l is\n\u03b4\u03c6 \u223c\n\ng 2 h\u03c72 i\n.\n\u03bb\u03c6\n14\n\n(71)\n\n\fThis becomes of order \u03c6 when h\u03c72 i reaches the value (68). After that h\u03c72 i does not grow\nany further at r \u223c l but continues to grow at r \u226b l.\nFrom our lattice data, it appears that this later growth is a combination of the usual resonant growth and rescattering of fluctuations from smaller r, where they are already large..\nAs a result, the region where h\u03c72 i is large propagates to larger r, so that the quasilinear\nform (61) no longer applies. From Eq. (25), we see that the growth of this region leads\nto a further growth of metric perturbations. If the total volume is large enough, these can\neventually become sufficiently large to cause a gravitational instability.\nThe time when the resonant growth of \u03c7 has ended in most of the space corresponds to a\nshort plateau around t = 250 in Fig. 2. The subsequent growth of \u03b4H \u03c8 has a different origin:\nwe interpret it is a result of an additional production of \u03b4\u03c6 by another, weaker resonance,\ndue to the \u03bb\u03c64 /4 interaction. During this further growth, we observe formation of a black\nhole-the lapse N, as a function of r, crosses zero.4\nThe presence of the second stage of growth in Fig. 2 leads to an important conclusion. If\nsome decay channel becomes blocked while the inflaton's homogeneous component still has\nnot decayed completely, the inflaton will \"wait\" until a new channel opens up. At least in\nour spherically-symmetric geometry, and in the model considered here, its decay via the new\nchannel still causes significant metric perturbations. This conclusion holds also in the case\nwhen the decay of the inflaton into \u03c7 is blocked by a \u03bb\u2032 \u03c74 /4 self-interaction (cf. Ref. [9]): we\nshow the result for g 2 /\u03bb = 8 (a stronger resonance) and \u03bb\u2032 /\u03bb = 1000 by short dashes in Fig.\n2. In this case, the decay into \u03c7 is cut off at much smaller values of metric perturbations,\nand the interpretation of the second stage of growth as the \u03bb\u03c64 resonance is unambiguous.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper we have studied the influence of nonlinear effects, arising during decay of\nthe inflaton, on metric perturbations. Although we restricted our attention to a quartic\npotential for the inflaton, results for other models of chaotic inflation can be obtained by\nsimilar methods, and we believe they will be similar in nature.\nEarly stages of the inflaton decay can be studied analytically, using the quasilinear\napproximation, at least under the restriction to spherical symmetry (a similar approximation\nmay exist also in the full 3d case). The quasilinear approximation retains quadratic terms in\nthe decay products; these are the leading terms affecting metric perturbations after inflation\nin the case when fields interacting with the inflaton do not have sizeable homogeneous\ncomponents.\n\n4\n\nOne may, and some physicists did, debate whether this is an adequate definition of a black\nhole. Our main argument remains the same as in Ref. [16]: for the metric (3), a sphere on which\nN = 0 cannot be crossed by a classical particle, and is therefore a horizon. On the other hand,\nquantum particles, or classical waves, can transport energy across the horizon (similarly to Hawking\nradiation); we suppose this transport is the cause of growth or evaporation of black holes in our\nsimulations.\n\n15\n\n\fUsing the quasilinear approximation, we have identified two effects that could potentially\nproduce large-scale metric perturbations after the end of inflation. We have found that\nthe first of these effects-scattering of the second field \u03c7 off the inflaton's homogeneous\ncomponent-does not cause significant super-Hubble perturbations in the quasilinear regime.\nHowever, the second type of effect-metric perturbations caused by the anisotropic stress-\nhas been found to be important.\nIt is interesting to contemplate how this latter effect is able to avoid the restriction on\nsuper-Hubble physics imposed by causality. To this end, note that a spherical wave has a\nlarge degree of angular coherence: even for a wave with momentum much larger than the\nHubble parameter, angular coherence extends over scales that are not in causal contact.\nParametric amplification of such fluctuations is not restricted by causality (just as it is not\nrestricted during inflation).\nPersistence of angular coherence of fluctuations in the full three dimensions corresponds\nto a large mean-free path. As we have discussed in Sect. II, this is indeed likely to be the case\nat the early stages of reheating in weakly-coupled models. However, because restriction to\nspherical symmetry explicitly breaks translational invariance, it is not immediately obvious\nhow our results can be transplanted to the full 3d case. Indeed, the r dependence of the\nensemble averages h\u03a6i and h\u03a8i (cf. (63)) is a direct consequence of the translational noninvariance and is not expected to persist in three dimensions. Instead, the 3d picture that\nwe have in mind is a sort of \"metric turbulence\", in which a (nearly) spherically-symmetric\nfluctuation in a sphere of radius R1 sits on top of a fluctuation in a sphere of a larger radius\nR2 . Then, instead of h\u03a6i and h\u03a8i we should consider the total perturbation from all scales\nshorter than some R, e.g.\n\u03b4R \u03a6 = h[\u03a6(x) \u2212 \u03a6(x + R)]2 i1/2 ,\n\n(72)\n\nso for example the quasilinear result (66) will correspond to\n\u03b4R \u03a6 \u223c\n\nh\u03c72 ifull R\nln\n2\nMPl\nl\n\n(73)\n\n(with an approximately scale-invariant 3d spectrum P\u03a6 (k) \u221d k \u22123 ln k).\nPerturbation (73) is by itself quite small. We have seen, however, that in spherical\nsymmetry a much larger perturbation is possible, due to spreading out of the region where\nfluctuations of \u03c7 are large. In Sect. VII, we have argued that this is indeed the mechanism\nof gravitational instability and formation of black holes observed in our lattice studies.\nBecause this mechanism involves already large field fluctuations, we cannot exclude the\npossibility that in the full three dimensions scattering of these large fluctuations destroys\nangular coherence, by breaking the s-wave into higher partial waves, and the formation of\nblack holes is prevented. However, if black holes do form in the full 3d by the mechanism\nidentified here, the question remains what is the spectrum of metric perturbations after\nthese black holes evaporate.\nThis work was supported in part by the U.S. Department of Energy through Grant\nDE-FG02-91ER40681 (Task B).\n\n16\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[1] A.
