Scattered electrons were detected in the CEBAF\nLarge Acceptance Spectrometer, for 0.05 < Q2 < 5 GeV2 and W < 3 GeV. The first moments of g1\nfor the proton and deuteron are presented \u2013 both have a negative slope at low Q2 , as predicted by\nthe extended Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn sum rule. The first extraction of the generalized forward spin\npolarizability of the proton \u03b30p is also reported. This quantity shows strong Q2 dependence at low\nQ2 . Our analysis of the Q2 evolution of the first moment of g1 shows agreement in leading order\nwith Heavy Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory. However, a significant discrepancy is observed\nbetween the \u03b30p data and Chiral Perturbation calculations for \u03b30p , even at the lowest Q2 .\nPACS numbers: 13.60.Hb;13.88.+e;14.20.Dh\nKeywords: Spin structure functions, nucleon structure, Chiral Perturbation Theory\n\nFundamental to our understanding of nuclear matter\nis a complete picture of the spin structure of the nucleon. The spin of the nucleon arises from the spin and\norbital angular momenta of both the quarks and gluons.\nOne way to access the quark spins in lepton scattering\nis through measurements of the spin structure functions\ng1 and g2 [1], which are not well known at low momentum transfer to the target nucleon (Q2 < 2 GeV2 ). At\nlarger momentum transfer, g1 (x, Q2 ) = 21 \u03a3e2i \u2206qi (x) (in\nthe parton picture), where \u2206qi /qi is the net helicity of\nquarks of flavor i in the direction of the (longitudinally\npolarized) nucleon spin, qi is the probability of finding a\nquark of flavor i with momentum fraction x, and ei is the\nQ2\nquark charge. (The Bjorken scaling variable x = 2M\u03bd\nin\nthe lab frame, M is the nucleon mass and \u03bd is the energy\ntransferred from the electron to the target nucleon.) At\nsufficiently small Q2 , g1 and its moments can be more\neconomically described by hadronic degrees of freedom\nand effective low-energy approximations to QCD, like\nChiral Perturbation Theory (\u03c7PT).\n\nThere is Rparticular interest in the first moment of g1 ,\nx\n\u03931 (Q2 ) = 0 0 g1 (x, Q2 )dx, which is related to the fraction of the nucleon spin carried by quark spins. The\nupper limit of the integral, x0 , corresponds to pion production threshold. This limit excludes elastic scattering,\nwhich otherwise dominates the low Q2 behavior of the\nintegral. \u03931 is constrained as Q2 \u2192 0 by the Gerasimov\u03ba2\n2\nDrell-Hearn (GDH) sum rule [2, 3] to be \u2212 8M\n2 Q , where\n\u03ba is the anomalous magnetic moment of the nucleon. At\nhigh Q2 , \u03931 has been measured in deep inelastic scattering (DIS) experiments at SLAC [4, 5], CERN [6, 7, 8]\nand DESY [9]. Ji and Osborne [10] have shown that the\nGDH sum rule can be generalized to all Q2 via\n\u03931 (Q2 ) =\n\nQ2\n2\nS1 (\u03bd = 0, Q2 ) \u2212 \u0393el\n1 (Q ),\n8\n\n(1)\n\nwhere S1 (\u03bd, Q2 ) is the spin-dependent virtual photon\nCompton amplitude and \u0393el\n1 is the contribution to the\nintegral from elastic scattering. At high Q2 , S1 can be\ncalculated using the operator product expansion (OPE).\n\n\f3\nBy comparing the OPE twist series with \u03931 , one can extract higher twist parameters [11, 12, 13, 14, 15], which\nare sensitive to quark-gluon and quark-quark correlations\nin the nucleon at moderate Q2 . Lattice QCD calculations\nmay eventually be available in the moderate Q2 region\nbelow the range of applicability of the OPE. At low Q2 ,\nS1 can be calculated in \u03c7PT, a model-independent effective field theory [16], but it is not clear how high in\nQ2 these calculations can be applied [17, 18]. Thus \u03931\npresents a calculable observable that spans the entire energy range from fundamental degrees of freedom (quarks\nand gluons) to effective ones (hadrons).\nHigher moments of g1 are interesting as well. In our\nkinematic domain, these moments emphasize the resonance region over DIS kinematics because of extra factors of x in the integrand. The fundamental generalized\nforward spin polarizability of the nucleon is given by [19]\nx0\n\n\u001b\n\u001a\n4M 2\nx2 g1 (x, Q2) \u2212 2 x2 g2 (x, Q2 ) dx,\nQ\n0\n(2)\nwhere the kinematic factor C(Q2 ) = 16\u03b1M 2 /Q6 and \u03b1 is\nthe fine structure constant. At high Q2 one would expect\ng2 to diminish significantly and g1 to vary logarithmically\nwith Q2 , thus \u03b30 weighted by Q6 should be largely independent of Q2 [1, 19, 20]. A measurement of \u03b30 on the\nneutron indicates no evidence for such \"scaling\" below\nQ2 = 1 GeV2 , and furthermore the data barely agree\nwith \u03c7PT calculations at low Q2 [21]. No measurement\nof \u03b30 on the proton has been reported so far.\nIn order to advance our theoretical understanding of\nthe nucleon spin, it is essential to have data on the spin\nstructure functions at low Q2 and in the resonance region,\nas well as at DIS kinematics. Data in the resonance region are necessary to calculate moments, especially at low\nand moderate Q2 . Until recently, data in the resonance\nregion were quite scarce [22], but new measurements of\nspin structure functions in the resonance region have now\nbeen reported on proton [23, 24], deuteron [25] and 3 He\ntargets [26, 27] from Jefferson Lab. Testing \u03c7PT at low\nQ2 has increasingly been a focus of new spin structure\nexperiments [28, 29, 30].\nThe EG1 experiment of the CLAS collaboration has\ncollected new data using longitudinally polarized 1.6 and\n5.7 GeV electrons on proton (NH3 ) and deuteron (ND3 )\ntargets [31]. These data cover a wide kinematic range\nthat includes invariant mass W 2 = M 2 + 2M \u03bd \u2212 Q2 from\nelastic scattering (quasielastic for the deuteron) up to 9\nGeV2 [32, 33]. First results for the generalized forward\nspin polarizability of the proton and new results for the\nfirst moments of g1p and g1d at low and intermediate Q2\nin the range 0.05 < Q2 < 3 GeV2 are reported in this\nletter.\nIn the EG1 experiment, the beam was produced from\na strained GaAs wafer and had an average polarization\nof 70% as measured by Moller polarimetry [34]. The po-\n\nZ\n\u03b30 (Q2 ) = C(Q2 )\n\nlarization of the electrons was flipped at 30 Hz pseudorandomly. The beam was rastered over the face of the\ntarget cell to avoid heating and depolarization. The current varied from 0.3 nA to 10 nA depending on the beam\nconditions and target.\nThe product of the beam and target polarizations Pb Pt\nwas determined from the data through comparison with\nthe known elastic scattering asymmetry and ranged from\n0.50 to 0.60 for the NH3 target and from 0.12 to 0.23 for\nthe ND3 target. Data were also taken with 12 C, 4 He and\nfrozen 15 N to determine the dilution from unpolarized\nmaterials [35].\nScattered electrons were detected in the CEBAF Large\nAcceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) in Hall B [34], covering\na range in polar angle from 8\u25e6 to 45\u25e6 in the efficient\nregion of the detector. Data acquisition was triggered\nby a coincidence between the \u010cerenkov detector and the\ncalorimeter in any one of the six sectors. Only electrons\ndetected in a region of the \u010cerenkov detector with an\nefficiency greater than 80% were used in the analysis.\nAdditional details about the experiment can be found in\nRefs. [25, 32].\nWe measured the raw inclusive double spin asymmetry with longitudinally polarized beam and target in each\nQ2 and W bin. This raw asymmetry was then corrected\nfor the difference in accumulated charge in the two beam\npolarization states, e+ e\u2212 pair production and pion contamination. Polarization and dilution factors were divided out and radiative corrections applied. The resulting asymmetry, A// , is proportional to a linear combination of the two virtual photon asymmetries A1 and A2\n[25]. Using a parameterization of the world data to model\nA2 [25], the unpolarized structure function F1 [36, 37],\nand the ratio of transverse to longitudinal structure functions R [36], A1 and g1 were extracted using:\n1\nA// \u2212 \u03b7A2 ,\nD\nF1\ng1 (x, Q2 ) =\n(A1 + \u03b3A2 ),\n1 + \u03b32\n\nA1 (x, Q2 ) =\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nwhere the depolarization factor D depends on R, \u03b7 is a\n2\nkinematical factor and \u03b3 2 = Q\n\u03bd 2 . The generalized forward\nspin polarizability for the proton was calculated from the\ndata\nthe F1 parameterization using \u03b30 (Q2 ) =\nR x0for A1 and\n2\nC 0 A1 F1 x dx, which is equivalent to Eq. (2).\nThe total systematic error on g1 varies greatly depending on the kinematic bin; for the proton it is roughly 10%\nand for the deuteron it is typically 15% for the 1.6 GeV\ndata and 20% for the high energy data. The systematic\nerror is dominated by model uncertainties on A2 , F1 and\nR, which are estimated by using different parametrizations of the world data. For the deuteron data the uncertainty in Pb Pt also contributes substantially to the\nsystematic error.\nThe values of g1p and g1d were extracted for Q2 from\n0.05 to 5 GeV2 and for x greater than 0.1; all results are\n\n\f0.01\n0.15\n\n0\n\n0.01\n0.06\n0\n\n0.04\n\n-0.01\n\nd\n\n0.125\n\n\u03931 (per nucleon)\n\n\u03931\n\np\n\n4\n\n-0.01\n\n0.1\n\n0.02\n0.075\n\n-0.02\n\n-0.02\n-0.03\n\n0\n\nBurkert-Ioffe\nSoffer-Teryaev\nCLAS EG1b\nCLAS EG1a\nHERMES\nSLAC E143\n\n0.05\n-0.03\n\nBurkert-Ioffe\n\n-0.02\n\nSoffer-Teryaev\n\n0.025\n\nGDH slope\nJi, \u03c7Pt\nBernard, \u03c7Pt\nPoly Fit\n\nCLAS EG1b\nCLAS EG1a\n\n0\n\nHERMES\n\n-0.04\n\n-0.04\n\nGDH slope\nJi, \u03c7Pt\nBernard, \u03c7Pt\nPoly Fit\n\n-0.04\n-0.05\n\nSLAC E143\n-0.025\n\n-0.05\n\n-0.06\n\n-0.06\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n30\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n2\n\n0.3\n2\n\n-0.06\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nFIG. 1: \u0393p1 as a function of Q2 . The data reported here\n(EG1b) are shown as the solid cirlces, along with the earlier EG1 data (EG1a)[23], SLAC [22] and Hermes data [9],\nshown for comparison. The filled circles represent the present\ndata, including an extrapolation over the unmeasured part of\nthe x spectrum using a model of world data. Phenomenological models of Burkert and Ioffe [39, 40] and Soffer and\nTeryaev [41] are represented by solid and dashed lines, respectively. The grey band represents the systematic error. In\nthe right plot, the scales are expanded and \u03c7PT calculations\nfrom Bernard [17] and Ji [18] are included.\n\navailable from the CLAS database [38]. At low Q2 , the\n\u2206(1232) resonance is quite prominent, with a negative\nasymmetry as expected for this transition. It decreases\nsteadily in strength as Q2 increases. In the mass region\nabove the \u2206(1232) resonance, g1 increases from nearly\nzero to large positive values as Q2 increases. In the\n\u2206(1232) region and at low Q2 , g1d /2 is consistent with\ng1p , as expected for a transition to an isospin 32 state.\nHowever, at high Q2 , g1p is significantly larger than g1d /2,\nindicating a negative contribution from the neutron.\nThe first moments of g1p and g1d are shown in Figs. 1\nand 2, respectively. The parametrization of world data\n[38] is used to include the unmeasured contribution to\nthe integral down to x = 0.001. The systematic uncertainty (shown by the grey bands) includes the model\nuncertainty from the extrapolation to the unmeasured\nregion. Only the Q2 bins in which the measured part\n(summed absolute value of the integrand) constitutes at\nleast 50% of the total integral are shown. For the proton,\nthe parametrization is also used at high x (in the range\n1.09 < W < 1.14 (1.15) GeV for the 1.6 (5.7) GeV data).\nFor the deuteron, the integration is carried out up to the\n\n30\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n2\n\nQ (GeV/c)\n\n0.3\n2\n\n-0.07\n\nQ (GeV/c)\n\nFIG. 2: \u0393d1 /2 as a function of Q2 . The symbols and curves\nare the same as for Fig. 1.\n\nnucleon pion production threshold at high x, excluding\nthe quasi-elastic and electro-disintegration contributions.\nOur low Q2 coverage allows us to observe, for the first\ntime, the slope changing sign at low Q2 , consistent with\nthe expectation of a negative slope given by the GDH\nsum rule at very low Q2 . In general the data are well described by the phenomenological models of Burkert and\nIoffe [39, 40] and Soffer and Teryaev [41].\nThe low Q2 \u03931 data are shown in more detail in\nthe right-hand panels of Figs. 1 and 2. It is possible\nto make a quantitative comparison between our results\nfor \u0393p1 and \u0393d1 at low Q2 and the next-to-leading order \u03c7PT calculation by Ji, Kao and Osborne [18], who\n\u03ba2\n\nfind \u0393p1 (Q2 ) = \u2212 8Mp2 Q2 + 3.89Q4 + * * * and \u0393n1 (Q2 ) =\n\u03ba2\n\n\u2212 8Mn2 Q2 + 3.15Q4 + * * * . Treating the deuteron as the\nincoherent sum of a proton and a neutron, and correcting\nfor the D-state as discussed in Ref. [42],\n\u0393d1 (Q2 ) =\n\n\b\n1\n(1 \u2212 1.5\u03c9D ) \u0393p1 (Q2 ) + \u0393n1 (Q2 ) ,\n2\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03c9D = 0.056 is the weight of the D-wave in the\ndeuteron, one finds that \u0393d1 (Q2 ) = \u22120.451Q2 + 3.26Q4.\nIn the range of Q2 from 0 to 0.3 GeV2 , we fit \u0393p1 and \u0393d1\nto a function of the form aQ2 + bQ4 + cQ6 + dQ8 , where\na is fixed at \u22120.456 (proton) and \u22120.451 (deuteron) by\nthe GDH sum rule. Note that the GDH sum rule on the\ndeuteron here excludes the two-body breakup part, which\notherwise nearly cancels the inelastic contribution [43].\nThe fit results for the proton, b = 4.31\u00b10.31 (stat) \u00b11.36\n(syst), and for the deuteron, b = 3.19 \u00b1 0.44 (stat) \u00b10.68\n\n\f5\n\n3\n\n0.02\n3\n\n3\n\nKao et al, O(p )+\u2206(\u03b5 )\n3\n\n4\n\nKao et al, O(p )+O(p )\n2\n\n0.015\n\nMAID 2003 (\u03c0)\nBernard et al.\nModels\n\n1\n\n\u03b3p0Q6/(16\u03b1M2)\n\n\u03b3p0 (10-4 fm4)\n\n(syst), are both consistent with the Q4 term predicted\nby Ji et al. [18]. The fit (labelled \"Poly Fit\") is shown\nin the right-hand panels of Figs. 1 and 2 along with Ji's\nprediction. Clearly the Q6 term becomes important even\nbelow Q2 = 0.1 GeV2 and this term needs to be included\nin the \u03c7PT calculations in order to extend the range of\ntheir validity beyond roughly Q2 = 0.06 GeV2 . The \u03c7PT\n4th order (one-loop), relativistic calculation by Bernard\net al. [17] is also shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Not shown is the\nresult from Bernard et al. that includes an estimate of the\n\u2206(1232) and vector meson degrees of freedom, which are\nimportant at low Q2 .

The systematic error on the measured (grey) and unmeasured (dark) contributions are indicated by bands. \u03c7PT\ncalculations [17, 45] are shown along with MAID 2003 [46].\nThe data shown on the right are weighted by Q6 /(16\u03b1M 2 ).\nOur parametrization of world data is also shown at moderate\nto high Q2 .\n\nFig. 3 shows the result for the generalized forward spin\npolarizability of the proton \u03b30p (Q2 ). Since \u03b30 is weighted\nby an additional factor of x2 compared to \u03931 , the integral is mostly saturated by the \u2206(1232) resonance and\nuncertainties due to the low-x extrapolation are greatly\nreduced. The MAID 2003 [46] model follows the trend of\nthe data but lies systematically below them. The MAID\nmodel is consistent with our data for A1 in the \u2206 resonance region, but MAID includes only single-pion production channels, which leads to an underestimation of\nthe unpolarized structure function F1 entering the defi-\n\nnition of \u03b30 .\nUnlike \u03931 , \u03b30 is not constrained at Q2 = 0 and is therefore a more stringent test of Chiral Perturbation calculations. The leading order heavy baryon \u03c7PT calculation\nby Kao, Spitzenberg and Vanderhaeghen [45], shown by\nthe dotted line in Fig. 3, includes the \u2206 resonance contribution. Their 4th order calculation (dashed line) is\nof opposite sign and shows no sign of convergence; neither calculation reproduces the trend or magnitude of the\ndata. The relativistic \u03c7PT calculation of Bernard, Hemmert and Meissner converges better at 4th order [17].\nThat calculation, including the resonance contribution,\nis represented by the grey band in Fig. 3, and is also in\nserious disagreement with the data. The \u2206(1232) and\nvector meson contribution is negative (around \u22122 \u00d7 10\u22124\nfm4 ) and is consistent with the calculation by Kao et al.\nat Q2 = 0, suggesting that the discrepancy at low Q2 is\nmainly due to the non-resonance terms [47].\nIn the right-hand panel of Fig. 3, \u03b30p is weighted by a\nfactor of Q6 /(16\u03b1M 2 ). In the limit of very large Q2 , this\nexpression converges to the third moment of g1 , a2 , which\nis expected to scale approximately in the framework of\nOPE. Our data seem to be leveling off above Q2 = 1.5\nGeV2 , but do not go high enough in Q2 to confirm\nscaling\nRx\nbehavior. We also show an evaluation of 0 0 A1 F1 x2 dx\n(shaded band) based on our model for F1 and a fit to\nthe world data for A1 (mostly from SLAC, SMC, and\nHERMES in addition to our own data). The width of\nthe shaded band indicates the combined one-sigma uncertainty of the models of F1 and A1 . Our model confirms the leveling-off around Q2 = 2 GeV2 and shows a\nlogarithmic fall-off at higher Q2 .\nIn summary, g1 (x, Q2 ) for the proton and the deuteron\nhave been measured over a vastly expanded kinematic\nrange at low and intermediate momentum transfer, which\nincludes the entire resonance region and part of the DIS\nregime. These measurements enable us to evaluate moments of g1 over a wider range in Q2 , decreasing extrapolation uncertainties. The first extraction of \u03b30p has been\nreported along with a new precise mapping of \u0393p1 and \u0393d1\ndown to lower Q2 than previously available. At moderately high Q2 our data for Q6 \u03b30p seem to level off, in\nagreement with models and QCD expectations, and we\nsee the expected trend toward DIS results in \u03931 . It will\nbe interesting to extend these measurements to higher\nQ2 once the upgraded beam energy is available at Jefferson Lab. At low Q2 , the first moments of g1p and g1d\nexhibit a change in the sign of the slope, to match the\nnegative slope constraint from the generalized GDH sum\nrule, and are consistent with \u03c7PT calculations for momentum transfer values up to about 0.06 GeV2 . It is\nimportant to note, however, that these \u03c7PT calculations\nalso assume the validity of the GDH sum rule; a more\nsensitive test of \u03c7PT calculations is \u03b30 (Q2 ). We observe\nthat \u03c7PT calculations fail to describe our results for \u03b30p ,\neven for Q2 as low as 0.05 GeV2 . The \u03c7PT calculations\n\n\f6\nare increasingly being used to extract results from lattice\nQCD and it is critical to understand their range of applicability [16]. Data for the isoscalar quantity \u03b30p \u2212 \u03b30n\nhave also been published by our collaboration and may\ngive additional guidance to future theoretical work in this\narea [48]. We also look forward to results from new experiments at Jefferson Lab, in which spin structure functions\ndown to Q2 = 0.01 GeV2 will provide a more stringent\ntest of \u03c7PT [28, 29, 30].\nWe would like to acknowledge the outstanding efforts\nof the staff of the Accelerator and the Physics Divisions at\nJefferson Lab that made this experiment possible.
