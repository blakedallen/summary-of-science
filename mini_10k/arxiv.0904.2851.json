For this purpose, we\nperform a comparative study of galaxies with and without close companions as a\nfunction of local density and host-halo mass, carefully removing sources of possible\nbiases.\nWe find that at low and high local density environments, colours and morphologies of close galaxy pairs are very similar to those of isolated galaxies.

The\npresence of a correlation between colours and morphologies indicates that the physical mechanism responsible for the colour transformation also operates changing galaxy\nmorphologies. At fixed local densities, we find a dependence of the red galaxy fraction\non dark matter halo mass for galaxies with or without a close companion. This suggests the action of host halo mass related effects. Regardless of dark matter halo mass,\nwe show that the percentage of red galaxies in close pairs and in the control sample\nare comparable at low and high local density environments. However, at intermediate\nlocal densities, the gap in the red fraction between close pairs and the control galaxies\nincreases from \u223c 10% in low mass haloes up to \u223c 50% in the most massive ones.\nInterestingly, we also detect that 50% of merging systems populate the intermediate\nlocal environments, with a large fraction of them being extremely red and bulge dominated. Our findings suggest that in intermediate density environments galaxies are\nefficiently pre-processed by close encounters and mergers before entering higher local\ndensity regions.\nKey words: galaxies: evolution, galaxies: general, galaxies: interactions.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nSeveral observational and theoretical works have gathered\nevidence to determine that the environment where galaxies reside plays a fundamental role in shaping their properties. However, although the transformation of blue, latetype and star-forming field galaxies into red, early-type and\npassive cluster galaxies have been well established (Oemler\n1974; Dressler 1980; Lewis et al. 2002; Gomez et al. 2003;\nBalogh et al. 2004; Baldry et al. 2004; O'Mill, Padilla &\nLambas, 2008), there is no consensus on the mechanisms re-\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: jperez@fcaglp.unlp.edu.ar\n\nsponsible for this transformation. Many explanations have\nbeen proposed including: i) ram-pressure stripping of cold\ninterstellar gas of galaxies falling at high velocities into the\nICM, which produces a fast truncation of the star formation\n(Gunn & Gott 1972); ii) starvation or strangulation, which\nare also stripping gas processes of the hot diffuse component of satellite galaxies, which affects the star formation\non longer timescales (Larson et al. 1980); iii) harassment,\nthe cumulative effect of several rapid encounters with other\ncluster members, which leads to substantial changes in the\ngalaxy morphology (Moore et al. 1998); iv) mergers and interactions of galaxies which can trigger an intense burst of\nstar formation, rapidly consuming the cold gas and forming\n\n\f2\n\nPerez et al.\n\nspheroidal systems (Toomre & Toomre 1972, Kauffmann et\nal. 1993). These explanations, however, are still under discussion.\nvan den Bosch et al. (2008) and Weinmann et al. (2008)\nanalyse the role of satellite quenching for the build-up the\nred galaxy sequence. They find that the environmental processes which shut down the star formation (SF) activity in\nsatellite galaxies are equally efficient in host haloes of all\nmasses. This rules against mechanisms that are thought to\noperate only in very massive haloes, such as ram-pressure or\nharassment. They suggest that the process responsible for\nquenching the SF in satellites should last a timescale of a\nfew Gyr, suggesting starvation as the satellite-specific transformation mechanism. They also claim that an additional\nmechanism is also required because quenching alone cannot\nexplain the morphological transformations in the build-up\nof the red sequence.\nAlternatively, attempts have been made to remove the\nproblem from clusters entirely by proposing a preprocessing\nof disc blue galaxies to red earlier type systems at moderate\nenvironments (Balogh et al. 2004; Mihos 2004; Moss 2006;\nPatel et al. 2008). Recently, many authors have investigated\nthe dependence of galaxy properties on environment at intermediate densities (i.e. galaxy groups in the outskirt of\nclusters, infall populations) suggesting different mechanisms\nto account for them. Patel et al. (2008) find that galaxies at\ncluster-centric radii larger than 3 Mpc show an enhanced red\ngalaxy fraction, indicating that intermediate density regions\nand groups in the outskirts of clusters are locations where\nthe local environment influences the transition of galaxies\nonto the red-sequence, as opposed to mechanisms that operate on cluster scales (e.g. ram-pressure stripping, harassment). In the same direction, Moss (2006) provides evidence\nstating that the cluster giant S0 population can be explained\nas the outcome of minor mergers with the infalling population integrated over the past \u223c 10 Gyr.\nAnalysis of the SF at intermediate environments show\nthat the current SFR of a galaxy falling along a supercluster\nfilament is likely to undergo a sudden enhancement before\nthe galaxy reaches the virial radius of the cluster (Porter\net al. 2008). These authors suggest that the main process\nresponsible for this rapid burst are close interactions with\nother galaxies in the same filament, if the interactions occur\nbefore the gas reservoir of the galaxy gets stripped off due\nto the interaction with the ICM.\nOn the other hand, Gallazzi et al. (2008) explore the\namount of obscured SF as a function of environments in the\nA901/902 supercluster. The SF hidden among red galaxies\nis detected by using SF indicators that are not affected by\ndust attenuation. Otherwise, they could be missed or mistakenly classified as post-starburst on the basis of their weak\nemission lines obtained via optical, dust-sensitive SFR indicators. Combining the near UV/optical data with infrared\nphotometry, they find that \u223c 60% of red star-forming galaxies have IR-to-UV luminosity ratios which indicate high dust\nobscuration. Interestingly, most of them populate intermediate density regions. In agreement with this result, Wolf\net al. (2005) have also identified an excess of dusty red\ngalaxies with young stellar populations in the infalling region of the same cluster. More evidence of dust-obscured\nSF at intermediate regions is provided by Miller & Owen\n(2002). They find that up to \u223c 20% of the galaxies in 20\n\nnearby Abell clusters have dust-obscured SF and are preferentially located at intermediate density regions, with respect to normal star-forming galaxies or AGNs. In addition, Poggianti et al. (2008) report that dusty starburst candidates present a very different environmental dependence\nthan post-starburst galaxies. They find that the spectra of\ndusty starburst candidates are numerous in all environments\nat intermediate redshifts, particularly among galaxy groups.\nThis favours the hypothesis of dusty starbursts triggered by\nmergers, expected to be common in groups.\nMotivated by these findings, in this paper, we revise the\nrole of mergers and galaxy interactions in driving galaxy evolution at different density environments by using the SDSSDR4 data. In a hierarchical clustering universe, as Mihos\n(2004) noticed, galaxy clusters would form not by accreting\nindividual galaxies from the field, but rather through the infall of less massive groups moving along the filaments. Such\ninfalling groups provide locations with much lower velocity\ndispersions than the cluster medium, thus permitting strong\nslow encounters more normally associated with the field. In\nagreement, Moss (2006) shows that \u223c 50% \u2212 70% of the infall population are found to be in merging systems and slow\ngalaxy-galaxy encounters. Hence, we will focus our analysis\non close encounters and merger candidates in order to disentangle their role at such intermediate density regions. But\nbefore going any further, we analyse a technical issue.\nThe effect of galaxy interactions has been largely studied in optical and infrared surveys (Lambas et al. 2003;\nNikolic et al. 2004; Alonso et al. 2004; De Propris et al.\n2005; Kewley et al. 2006; Alonso et al. 2006; Lin et al. 2007;\nMichel-Dansac et al. 2008; Park et al. 2009) and also using numerical simulations (Barnes & Hernquist 1996; Mihos & Hernquist 1996; Larson & Tinsley 1978; Perez et al.\n2006a,b). These results conclude that mergers and close interactions could actually modify the star formation, morphology, colours and metallicities of galaxy pairs. In all\nthese cases, people have attempted to isolate the effects of\ngalaxy interactions by comparing galaxies in pairs with isolated galaxies. However, different authors have proposed different ways to build these control samples (CS). By using\nSDSS-DR4 mock galaxy catalogues built using the Millennium Simulation, Perez et al. (2009, hereafter P09) show\nthat the set of constrains used to define a CS might introduce biases which could affect the interpretation of results.\nThe fact that the physics of interactions is not included in\nthe semi-analytic model (SAM) studied in P09 allows the authors to attribute differences between the mock control and\npair samples solely to selection biases. P09 find that these\nbiases are diminished by \u2248 70% after imposing constrains\non redshifts, stellar masses and local densities, and are completely removed when halo masses are also considered (also\nsee Barton et al. 2007). However, P09 notice that the contribution of the halo mass bias introduced by the recipes\nadopted in SAMs to model satellite galaxies is probably exacerbated. Based on these previous theoretical findings, we\nfirst build an unbiased CS from the SDSS-DR4 data in order to isolate signals of galaxy interactions in a more robust\nway.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the SDSS-DR4 Galaxy Pair Catalogue and CS. We\nanalyse possible bias effects in the selection of CS (2.1) and\ncorrect them in order to obtain an unbiased CS, suitable for\n\n\f3\nisolating the effect of galaxy interactions (2.2). In Section\n2.3, we revise some of the previous observational results of\ngalaxy pairs by comparing them with isolated galaxies using the unbiased CS. The role of galaxy interactions and\nmergers in different local density and host-halo mass environments are discussed in Section 3. Finally, in Section 4 we\nsummarize our results.\n\n2\n\nBUILDING A CONTROL SAMPLE FOR A\nGALAXY PAIR CATALOGUE.\n\nThe analysis of this paper is based on the SDSS-DR4 photometric and spectroscopic galaxy catalogue, for which there\nare estimations of gas-phase oxygen abundances, stellar\nmasses and metallicities provided by Tremonti et al. (2004)\nand Gallazzi et al. (2005). Star formation rate estimates\nfor galaxies are obtained as described in Brinchmann et al.\n(2004). The SDSS-DR4 galaxy sample is essentially a magnitude limited spectroscopic sample with rlim < 17.77 covering a redshift range 0 < z < 0.25. We considered a shorter\nredshift range, 0.01 < z < 0.1, in order to avoid strong incompleteness at larger distances (Alonso et al. 2006). We\nalso excluded from our sample AGNs, which could affect\nour interpretation of results due to contributions from their\nemission line spectral features.\nWe characterized the local environment of galaxies\ndefining a projected density parameter, \u03a3. This parameter\nis calculated by using the projected distance to the 5th nearest neighbour, \u03a3 = 5/(\u03c0d25 ). Following Balogh et al. (2004),\nneighbours have been chosen to have luminosities brighter\nthan Mr < \u221220.5 and radial velocity differences lower than\n1000 km s\u22121 . In the case of pairs, we also estimated the local\ndensity by using the 6th nearest neighbour, in order to assess possible biases in the definition of the local density for\ngalaxy pairs. However, we find that our results are insensitive to the definition of \u03a3 by using either the 5th or the 6th\nnearest neighbour.\nWe use the SDSS-DR4 galaxy group catalogue from Zapata et al. (2009) to assign a host halo mass (Mvir ) to each\nindividual galaxy in our sample. This group catalogue is\ncomplete above masses of 1013 h\u22121 M\u2299 , out to the limit redshift of our galaxy sample, z = 0.1. The mass assignment is\ndone by searching for the closest group, in terms of its virial\nradius rvir , to each galaxy; if a group is found within 1.5 rvir\nin projection and with a velocity difference, \u2206v < 1000km/s\nthe galaxy is assigned the group mass as its host halo mass.\nGalaxies which do not satisfy these conditions for any group\nare assumed to be hosted by haloes below the mass detection\nlimit of 1013 h\u22121 M\u2299 .\nFollowing Alonso et al. (2006, and references therein),\nwe build a Galaxy Pair Catalogue (GPC) requiring members\nto have relative projected separations rp < 100 kpc h\u22121 and\nrelative radial velocities \u2206V < 350 km s\u22121 . Galaxies without\na near companion within the adopted thresholds constitute\nthe Isolated Galaxy Sample (IGS). In order to properly assess the significance of the results obtained from the GPC,\nwe use a control sample (CS) constructed by selecting galaxies from the IGS. In a first attempt to build a CS, we follow\nrecent observational works (Lambas et al., 2003; Alonso et\nal., 2006; Michel-Dansac et al., 2008) and define a CS by\nselecting galaxies from the IGS which match one-to-one the\n\nredshift and r-band magnitude of each galaxy in pairs, hereafter the SDSS-CS1.\nHowever, the analysis of SDSS-DR4 mock catalogues\nbuilt using the Millennium Simulation shows that a CS defined by only applying redshift and luminosity requirements\nexhibits different stellar masses, morphologies, halo masses\nand local projected density distributions than those of galaxies in pairs (P09) as discussed in the Introduction. Hence,\nin this section, and based on these theoretical findings, we\nanalyse how these biases could affect the selection of the\nSDSS-CS1, and then we correct them in order to build up\na robust 'unbiased' control sample.\n2.1\n\nAnalysis of biases in the selection of the\nSDSS-CS1.\n\nIn this subsection, we apply the tests devised by P09 to the\nSDSS-CS1, excluding the morphological selection, which we\nwill not consider in our work since in the case of merging\nsystems or close galaxy pairs with tidal features, it is rather\ndifficult to objectively define their morphology.\nIn Fig. 1, we perform a comparative analysis of stellar masses, halo masses and local projected density (\u03a3) distributions for SDSS-DR4 galaxy pairs (solid lines) and for\nthe SDSS-CS1 (dashed lines). The most significant differences between control and pair properties are observed for\nthe distributions of local density environment. In agreement\nwith theoretical findings by P09, galaxy pairs tend to inhabit\nhigher density regions than galaxies in the SDSS-CS1.\nConsistently with P09, we find that galaxy pairs exhibit slightly larger stellar masses than their isolated counterparts in the SDSS-CS1. However, observations show that\npair and control halo mass distributions are similar, in contradiction to P09 who reported that in the SAM the halo\nmass is the main factor contributing to bias the mock-CS1.\nAs a matter of fact, P09 found that mock galaxy pairs are\nhosted by larger dark matter haloes than galaxies in the\nmock-CS1. However, they warned that this effect could be\noverestimated in the SAM due to the environmental treatment of the starvation of hot gas in satellite galaxies (Weinmann et al. 2006; Kang et al. 2008; P09). Thus, the fact that\nSDSS galaxies with and without a near companion have similar halo mass distributions (Fig. 1), could be considered as\nan indication of the exacerbated environmental modelling of\nsatellite galaxies in the SAM. However, we remind the reader\nthat the dynamical estimates of halo masses used in this\npresent paper could also be introducing potential sources of\nerrors due to the uncertainties introduced by velocity dispersions (Eke et al. 2004; Padilla et al. 2004).\nThe observational results shown in Fig. 1 indicate that\neven when the local density environment is the most significant bias in the SDSS-CS1, we should also take into account\nboth stellar and halo masses in order to properly select the\nSDSS control sample.\n2.2\n\nTreatment of selection effects\n\nIn order to remove the bias introduced by the differences in\nstellar masses, we define a CS using stellar masses instead\nof magnitudes as a constrain. Thus, the SDSS-CS2 is built\nup by selecting galaxies from the IGS so that the distributions of redshifts and stellar masses match those of galaxies\n\n\f4\n\nPerez et al.\n2.3\n\nIsolating the effect of interactions.\n\nWe have shown that the set of constrains used to define the\nSDSS-CS1 introduces biases which could affect the interpretation of the results found for galaxy pairs. In this section,\nwe revise some previous observational analysis of galaxy\npairs from the SDSS-CS1 (Lambas et al. 2003; Alonso et\nal. 2006; Michel-Dansac et al. 2008) to evaluate how their\nresults would be modified considering the different CSs defined in the previous subsection.\nIn order to test the performance of each CS, we study\ntheir colours, metallicities and star formation activity, comparing them to those of galaxies in pairs. Particularly, we\nanalyse the dependence of the star formation activity on\nthe environment, as well as u \u2212 r colour distributions for\nthe SDSS-CS1, SDSS-CS2 and SDSS-CS3, finding similar results for all these CS (see P09 for a discussion on the\nmass-metallicity relation). The most significant change is\ndetected when analysing the properties of SDSS-CS4, indicating that, the local density environment is responsible\nfor introducing an important bias effect (see upper panel\nof Fig.1). Using results from a semi-analytical model, P09\nshowed that the halo mass is the parameter with the largest\ncontribution towards biasing a CS. However, they could not\nseparate this latter bias effect from the modelling bias associated to the treatment of satellites. The analysis of SDSS\ncontrol samples shows a less significant role of the dark matter mass in the CS definition than previously reported (P09,\nBarton et al. 2007), and contributes to show the exacerbated\nenvironmental modelling of satellite galaxies in the SAM\n(Weinmann et al. 2006; Kang et al. 2008).\n\n2.3.1\n\nFigure 1. Distributions of local density parameter (\u03a3) (upper\npanel), stellar masses (middle panel) and dark matter halo masses\n(lower panel), for SDSS galaxies in pairs (solid lines) and in the\nSDSS-CS1 (dashed lines).\n\nin pairs. Ellison et al. (2008) also build a CS using a similar\napproach to our SDSS-CS2 in order to study close galaxy\npairs in the SDSS. Additionally, we build a SDSS-CS3 imposing constrains on redshift, stellar mass and halo mass.\nFinally, we define the SDSS-CS4 populated by IGS galaxies\nmatching the galaxy pair redshift, stellar mass, local density\nenvironment and halo masses; the SDSS-CS4 should not be\naffected by selection biases according to the results by P09.\nAfter this CS building process, we have to remark that\nin order to construct the more suitable and 'unbiased' SDSSCS4, we remove around 8% of the galaxies in pairs from the\noriginal GP sample to account for the lack of counterparts\nin the IGS with identical stellar masses, local density environments and halo masses. Most of the removed galaxies in\npairs reside in high density regions where galaxies satisfying\nour isolation requirements are less common (Fig. 1).\n\nComparative analysis of galaxy pairs, SDSS-CS2\nand SDSS-CS4\n\nSince bias effects are removed only after defining the SDSSCS4, from this point on we will only show the results for\nsamples SDSS-CS2 and the 'unbiased' case. Note that we\nhave chosen the SDSS-CS2 instead of the SDSS-CS1, since\nthey behave similarly and, on the other hand, the stellar\nmass is a more fundamental quantity than the luminosity of\na galaxy (Brinchmann et al. 2000; Kauffmann et al. 2003;\nPanter et al. 2004).\nWe first analyse the SF activity in different density environments. Particularly, we estimate the SF history of systems by defining the stellar birthrate parameter,\nb = 0.5 tH (SF R/M\u2217 ), where tH is the Hubble time, and\nSF R/M\u2217 is the present star formation rate normalized to\nthe total stellar mass (Brinchmann et al. 2004). In Fig. 2, we\nshow the contour plots of the stellar birthrate parameter as\na function of the local density estimator (\u03a3) for galaxy pairs\n(left panels) and CSs (right panels). The upper plots show\nthe result for galaxies with and without a near companion\nusing the 'biased' CS21 definition. Lower panels show the\n'unbiased' results obtained by comparing galaxies in pairs\nwith those in the CS4. Note, that in order to define the\n'unbiased' CS4, we remove a small fraction of galaxies in\npairs, thus the galaxy pair samples also change from the\n\n1\n\nFor simplicity, hereafter from this point on we have suppressed\nthe SDSS prefix in sample names.\n\n\f5\ntop to the bottom panels. In order to clarify the discussion,\nfrom this point on we will refer to the galaxy pair samples as\nGP2 (upper left panel) and GP4 (lower left panel), respectively. The green lines in the plots divide the three different\nenvironmental regions discussed throughout this paper (see\nTable 1 for description).\nAs we can appreciate in the top panels of Fig. 2, the\nbiased samples show that while galaxies with a near companion (top left) have a clearer bimodal distribution in the\nSF-environment relation (i.e. a large fraction of passive SF\ngalaxies populating high density regions), isolated galaxies\n(top right) are more consistent with a unimodal SF distribution shifted to high values of the stellar birthrate parameter.\nThese significant differences between galaxies in GP2 and\nin CS2, however, cannot be only attributed to galaxy interactions, but also to a biased selection of these samples.\nIndeed, we can see that the SF-environment relation of the\n'unbiased' CS4 (bottom right) significantly changes with\nrespect to that of CS2 (top right), resembling more closely\nthat of its pair counterpart, GP4 (bottom left). This means\nthat after correcting for the biases, the differences between\nthe SF-environment distributions of galaxies with and without a near companion are partially reduced. However, discrepancies still remain even when GP4 is compared to the\nunbiased CS4, suggesting a real effect coming from galaxy\ninteractions. We find that, at high densities, the GP4 has\na larger fraction of low star-forming systems than the CS4\nwhile at intermediate and low density environments, it has\nlarger fractions of strong star-forming galaxies.\nAlonso et al. (2006) have previously analysed the efficiency of galaxy interactions in driving the SF, and how the\nenvironment can modify this efficiency. They show that, at\nlow and intermediate density regions, close galaxy interactions are more effective at triggering important SF activity\nthan galaxies without a near companion. We revised their\nestimates using samples 2 (CS2 and GP2) and samples 4\n(CS4 and GP4) for the purpose of assessing possible bias\neffects. Fig. 3 shows the fraction of strong SF galaxy pairs\nas a function of their relative projected separations, rp . This\nfraction is defined by systems with SF activity larger than\nthe mean b of their corresponding control sample so that\nthey have b > 1. The analysis was performed at high (dashed\nlines), intermediate (solid lines) and low (dotted lines) density environments (see Table 1). Horizontal lines represent\nthe mean value of the fraction associated to the corresponding CS in each environment. We reproduce the findings of\nAlonso et al. (2006) where the only significant change is detected in low density regions, where we find that galaxy pairs\nare required to be closer than in GP2 (within 1\u03c3) in order\nto exhibit an enhanced SF activity. This is a consequence of\nan increment of the SF activity in the CS4 with respect to\nthat measured in the CS2 at low densities, indicated by the\nincrease of the fraction of b > 1 galaxies from 0.25 to 0.29\n(see also Fig. 2 (right panels)).\nGiven that galaxy pairs closer than a critical relative\nprojected separation are more efficient at forming stars than\ntheir isolated counterparts, we will concentrate our analysis\non studying the properties of close galaxy pairs from this\npoint on. The lower panel of Fig. 3 shows that regardless\nof environment, systems with rp < 20 kpc h\u22121 have a statistically significant enhancement in their SF activity. Thus,\n\nFigure 3. Fraction of strong star forming galaxies (b > 1 where\nb has been normalized to the mean b of the corresponding control\nsample) in the GP catalogue as a function of their relative projected separation, rp , at high (dashed lines), intermediate (solid\nlines) and low (dotted lines) density environments (see Table 1).\nHorizontal lines represent the fractions associated to each CS estimated with respect to their mean SF activity. In the upper panel\nwe show the result for GP2 and CS2, and in the lower one, for\nGP4 and CS4.\n\nwe select close galaxy pairs by using this threshold on the\nrelative projected separation.\nRegarding colour distributions, observational results\n(e.g. Alonso et al. 2006; De Propris et al. 2005) have reported an excess of blue galaxies in close pairs with respect\nto that found in their CS, associated with a larger fraction of actively star-forming galaxies. They also find a larger\nfraction of red galaxies in close pairs with respect to those\nsystems without a near companion, an effect that might indicate that dust, stirred up during encounters, could affect\ncolours, partially obscuring the tidally-induced SF (Gallazzi\net al. 2008). Other possible interpretation of this trend is\nthat many galaxies in pairs have been very efficient at forming stars during the early stages of their evolution, so that\nat present they exhibit red colours. In Fig. 4, we can see that\neven though the differences at the red peak are reduced after removing the bias effects in the selection of the CS4, the\nexcess of close galaxy pairs in both red and blue tails with\nrespect to the CS4 still persists, supporting the claim that\nthese trends are actually produced by galaxy interactions\nand not introduced by a biased selection.\n\n\f6\n\nPerez et al.\n\nFigure 2.

Upper (lower) panels show the biased samples 2 (unbiased samples 4), see the text for more details. The sequence from red to\ndark blue colours indicates a decrease in the galaxy number density. Green lines divide low, intermediate and high density environments\n(see Table 1).\n\nTable 1. Ranges of local density environments (\u03a3) and halo masses (Mvir ) considered in this paper.

In this section, we analyse close\ngalaxy interactions and mergers as possible environmental\nprocesses leading to evolutionary transformations. In order\nto asses how efficient galaxy interactions are with respect to\nother environmental mechanisms we analyse the properties\nof close galaxy pairs in different environments characterized\nby their local galaxy density and by their host dark matter\nhalo masses.\n\n3.1\n\nGalaxy interactions\n\nThe analysis of the colour distributions of galaxies by Baldry\net al. (2004, also Balogh et al. 2004) showed that these distributions could be well fitted by a double Gaussian over a\nwide range of absolute magnitudes and local densities. The\nnegligible variation of the blue and red peak locations of this\nbimodal distribution with local galaxy density at fixed luminosities suggests that the process responsible for the transformation from blue to red colours needs to be very fast and\nefficient in order to overcome the effects of environment. In\nFig. 5, we show the u \u2212 r colour distributions of close galaxy\npairs in comparison to their isolated counterparts in CS4.\nThe analysis was performed for the three different local density environments previously considered (see Table 1). We\nfind that at low and high density environments (upper and\nlower panel, respectively), the colour distributions of close\n\n\f7\n\nFigure 4. Colour distributions of close galaxy pairs (solid lines)\nand control samples (dashed lines). The upper panel shows both\npair and control galaxies of samples 2 and lower panel the same\nfor samples 4.\n\npairs are more similar to those of CS4 than at intermediate\nlocal densities. As expected, low density environments are\nmostly populated by blue galaxies whereas high densities\nare populated by red galaxies. Interestingly, at intermediate\nenvironments (middle panel), the close pair and the CS4\ncolour distributions exhibit significant differences, with pairs\nhaving a larger fraction of red members. This might indicate that close pairs could have experienced a more efficient\ntransition from blue to red colours, while isolated galaxies\nin CS4 experience a more inefficient transformation.\nIt is remarkable that the more significant disagreement\nin their colours is observed at both the blue and red tails,\nwith a clear excess of extremely blue and red systems in\nclose pairs (see also Alonso et al. 2006). The blue excess of\nclose galaxy pairs is expected to be tidally induced, associated to the enhanced SF already shown in Fig.3 (e..g Lambas et al. 2003; Nikolic et al. 2004). The extremely red close\npairs could be accounted for by dusty, obscured star-forming\nsystems, as suggested by observations which indicate an intrinsic reddening associated to the near infrared emission\nof hot dust present in tidally-triggered star forming regions\n(Geller et al. 2006; Lin et al. 2007). Interestingly, there are\nobservational indications of an excess of the red, obscured\nstar-forming galaxies at intermediate densities (Wolf et al.\n2005; Gallazzi et al. 2008; Poggianti et al. 2008). These evidences may support the idea of a connection between the\nexcess of red close galaxy pairs at intermediate densities and\na tidally induced dusty SF. However, there are other plausible interpretations. Red galaxies in pairs could be systems\ndominated by old stellar populations which had their gas\n\nFigure 5. Colour distributions of close galaxy pairs (solid lines)\nand of CS4 (dashed lines), at low (upper panel), intermediate\n(middle panel) and high (lower panel) density environments.\n\nreservoir stripped as they entered higher density regions so\nthat interactions are now unable to trigger new SF events.\nThis possibility will be tested in the following sections when\nwe analyse the dependence on environment since this should\naffect both galaxies in pairs and in isolation. Alternatively,\nisolated galaxies could also include merger remnants with\nblue colours as a consequence of the recently triggered SF\nactivity while close galaxy pairs could be just starting to\ninteract and, hence, reflect only the colour of the underlying stellar population. Unfortunately, we cannot address this\npossibility using the currently available data.\nEven when the morphological classification of interacting systems is difficult to perform, especially in the case of\nmergers and close galaxy pairs with tidal distortions, one\ncan consider the concentration index, C, defined by the ratio of the Petrosian 90%\u221250% r-band light radii, as a global\nindicator of the structural luminosity distribution in these\ngalaxies. Bearing this in mind, we explore the concentration\nindex distributions of close galaxy pairs in comparison with\nthose of CS4 at the same three different local density environments of Fig. 5. In order to highlight the result of Fig. 6,\nwe plot a dotted vertical line indicating the critical concentration index value of C = 2.5 adopted to segregate concentrated, bulge-like (C > 2.5) galaxies from more extended,\ndisc-like (C < 2.5) systems. The concentration index distributions of close pairs approximately match those of CS4 at\nlow and high density environments, following the expected\n\n\f8\n\nPerez et al.\n\nFigure 6. Concentration index (C = r90/r50) distributions of\nclose galaxy pairs (solid lines) and of CS4 (dashed lines), for low\n(upper panel), intermediate (middle panel) and high (lower panel)\ndensity environments. Vertical dotted lines represent the critical\nconcentration index value (C = 2.5) adopted to segregate bulge\n(C > 2.5) from disc (C < 2.5) dominated morphologies.\n\nmorphology-density relation (Dressler 1980; Gomez et al.\n2003), with a larger fraction of disc (bulge) dominated systems populating the low (high) density environments. Again\nit is at intermediate density regions where we find a significant difference, indicating that most of the members of pairs\ntend to be bulge-dominated systems.\nThe similar trends found for colours and morphologies\nas a function of environment (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6) suggest a\ncommon physical mechanism responsible for both the galaxy\ncolour and the morphological transformations.\n\n3.2\n\nGlobal environmental effects\n\nUp to this point, we have only analysed the role of close\ngalaxy interactions at different local density environments.\nHowever, many other environmental processes (e.g., rampressure stripping, starvation, harassment, etc.) may collaborate to produce the trend found at intermediate densities.\nIn order to isolate the effect of galaxy interactions from other\nenvironmental processes, we have also investigated galaxy\nproperties taking into account the masses of their dark matter host haloes. For this purpose, we resorted to the dark\nmatter halo catalogues of Zapata et al. (2009) which identified groups in the SDSS-DR4 (with a minimum number of 10\n\nmembers) by using dynamical criteria as explained in details\nby the authors. Then, we assigned each galaxy in our catalogue to one of these groups by using the criteria explained\nin Section 2. Galaxies which did not satisfy them are considered to inhabit haloes with masses lower than 1013 h\u22121 M\u2299 .\nFig. 7 shows the red fraction ((u \u2212 r) > 2.5) of close\ngalaxy pairs and of those galaxies in the CS4 as a function\nof the local galaxy density parameter (\u03a3). The analysis was\nperformed for three different halo mass ranges described in\nTable 1: small, medium and large mass haloes. We studied\ngalaxies in both GP4 and CS4 which reside in the same local density regions and in haloes of similar mass and hence,\nany possible signal should be presumably ascribed to galaxy\ninteractions. From this figure we can see that the underlying trend is consistent with the expected increase of the\nred fraction with local galaxy density for both galaxies in\npairs and without a companion, which might be associated\nwith the action of host-halo mass dependent processes. Interestingly, at intermediate local densities (shaded regions),\nregardless of halo mass, the red fraction of galaxies in close\npairs (square symbols) comfortably exceeds that of isolated\ngalaxies in the CS4 (solid lines), suggesting that the mechanism which drives the evolution of galaxies in close pairs at\nintermediate local density regions is not regulated by hosthalo mass dependent processes alone.\nTo quantify these results, we also calculated the percentages of red galaxies in close pairs and in the CS4 for\nthe three different bins of local density environments and\nhalo masses defined in Table 1. We find that, independently\nof their halo masses, at low and high local density environments, the percentages of red systems in close pairs are very\nsimilar to those found in the CS4 (columns 1 and 3 of Table 2). Computing the difference of percentage between the\nclose pairs and the CS4 for these two columns, we get a\nmaximum value of \u223c 8%, with an increase of \u2248 10% from\nlow to high mass haloes for both galaxies in pairs and in the\ncontrol sample. However, at intermediate densities (column\n2), the gap between the red fraction of close pairs and CS4\nincreases remarkably from 7.7% in low mass haloes to 45.6%\nin high mass haloes.\nWe have also analysed the role of mergers in different\nenvironments. The merging galaxy sample considered in this\npaper was extracted from the close galaxy pair sample by selecting objects with morphological disturbances and strong\nsignals of interactions, as explained by Alonso et al. (2007).\nFirst, we analyse the cummulative distribution of merging\nsystems and close galaxy pairs in different local density environments (Figure 8). As can be seen, the number of close\ngalaxy pairs (small dots) and merging systems (asterisks)\nincreases rapidly in intermediate density environments (delimited by the vertical dashed lines in the figure). This result\nagrees with previous works indicating that merging systems\nand galaxy-galaxy encounters are frequent in intermediate\ndensity regions (e.g. Moss 2006). As the figure shows, we find\n\u223c 30% of close galaxy pairs and 50% for merging systems at\nintermediate local density environments. In Fig. 9, we show\ncolours and morphologies of close galaxy pairs (blue dots)\nand merging systems (green asterisks), at the same local\ndensity bins previously considered. A large fraction of merging systems populating the sequence of extremely red and\nbulge-dominated galaxies can be found at intermediate local\ndensities (middle panel). Particularly, 26% of merging galax-\n\n\f9\nTable 2.

(2008) if we assume that dust\nobscuration is hiding much of the enhanced SF activity triggered by interactions. Kapferer et al. (2008) find that the\nglobal SFR of interacting systems is largely enhanced in\nthe presence of a moderate ram pressure, in comparison to\nthe same interaction without the presence of an ambient\nmedium. They use hydrodynamical simulations to model interacting galaxies moving through a hot, thin medium. This\nmodel mimics an average low ram pressure in the outskirts\nof galaxy cluster where systems interact at low velocities, resembling galaxy interactions occurring within groups, falling\nalong cluster filaments. Combining this prediction with the\nobservational results that show an increment of red dusty\nstar forming systems at intermediate environments (Gallazzi\net al. 2008), we might suggest that, at intermediate density\nregions, where galaxy interactions are more frequent, low\nram pressure stripping from the diffuse intra-group medium\ncould collaborate to enhance the effect of galaxy interactions, rising the fraction of red star-forming galaxies in close\npairs up to almost 50% over that found in the CS4.\nNevertheless, we should warn about the fact that the\nlarge excess of red galaxy fractions in close pairs at intermediate local densities and within large halos, could be overestimated. Large haloes tend to have larger differences between\nthe central and satellite galaxy luminosities than smaller\nones. Consequently, some galaxies could be mistakenly classified as control samples although they could have a near\ncompanion, faint enough to be undetected by the SDDS.\n\n4\n\nFigure 7.

Samples were divided in three different bins of halo masses, from top\nto bottom panels: small, medium and large haloes (See Table 1\nfor descriptions).\n\nSUMMARY\n\nRecently, many authors have proposed that intermediate\ndensity regions (i.e. galaxy groups in the outskirt of clusters, infalling populations) are the locations where the local\nenvironment influences the transition of galaxies onto the\nred-sequence, as opposed to mechanisms that operate on\ncluster scales. In this paper, we use the SDSS-DR4 data to\nexplore the role of mergers and interactions as environmental\nprocesses driving evolutionary transformations of galaxies.\nWe analyse properties of galaxy pairs and merging systems\nin different local density environments and with different\nhost halo masses, comparing these properties with those of\nisolated galaxies in an unbiased CS.\n\n\f10\n\nPerez et al.\n\nFigure 8. Cummulative fraction of galaxies in close pairs (small\ndots) and merging systems (asterisks) as a function of local density parameter. Vertical dashed lines indicate the intermediate\nlocal density regions (see Table 1).\n\nWe build a Galaxy Pair Catalogue from SDSS-DR4\ndata, by requiring its members to have relative projected\nseparations: rp < 100 kpc h\u22121 and relative radial velocities:\n\u2206V < 350 km s\u22121 . For comparison, and in order to isolate\nthe effects of galaxy interactions, we have considered previous theoretical findings (P09) and build an 'unbiased' CS\nimposing constrains on redshift, stellar mass, local density\nand halo mass, to match those of galaxies in the Pair Catalogue. The analysis of biases in the selections of the SDSS\nCS shows that, contrary to semi-analytical simulations, the\nlocal density environment is responsible for introducing the\nlargest bias effect, giving the dark matter halo mass a less\nsignificant role in the CS definition than previously reported\n(Barton et al. 2007; P09). Even when the dynamical method\nto estimate halo masses is still crude, this finding might be\nan indication of an unsuitable treatment of satellite galaxies\nin the SAMs.\nIn order to asses the efficiency of galaxy interactions in\ncomparison to other environmental mechanisms, we analyse\nthe properties of close galaxy pairs in different local environments and residing in host haloes of different masses,\nin comparison to isolated galaxies in the 'unbiased' control\nsample in similar environments. We have characterized the\nlocal environment by means of the local galaxy projected\ndensity, computed with the 5th nearest bright neighbour,\nand via constraints on their host DM halo masses.\nOur results can be summarized as follows:\n\nFigure 9. Scatter plot of colour and concentration index for close\ngalaxy pairs (blue small dots) and merging systems (green asterisks) at low (upper panel), intermediate (middle panel) and high\n(lower panel) density environments (see Table 1). Red horizontal lines (at C = 2.5) separate disc from bulge dominated systems, and vertical ones indicate the blue ((u \u2212 r) < 1.5) and red\n((u \u2212 r) > 2.8) tails in the colour distributions.\n\n(i) We analyse the colour distributions of close galaxy\npairs in comparison to those of the control sample at low, intermediate and high local densities. We find that, at low and\nhigh density environments, the colour distributions of close\npairs are similar to those of the control sample. An opposite\neffect is found at intermediate densities, where their colour\ndistributions exhibit significant differences, indicating that\nclose pairs could have experienced a more rapid transition\nfrom blue to red colours, while the isolated galaxies in the\ncontrol sample undertake a more inefficient transformation.\nThe significant disagreement in their colour distributions is\ndetected in both colour tails, with a clear excess of extremely\nblue and red systems in close pairs. We speculate that these\nexcesses might be likely associated with the enhancement\nof obscured (e.g. Gallazzi et al. 2008) and unobscured (e.g.\nAlonso et al. 2006) SF activity tidally induced by close interactions. Other explanations are possible as well, as is discussed in Section 3.1\n(ii) In consistence with our analysis on colours, the distributions of concentration indexes of close galaxy pairs and\ngalaxies in the control samples shows that they are similar\nat low and high local density environments, following the\nexpected morphology-density relation. Again, it is at intermediate local density regions where we find important differences, indicating that most of the galaxies in pairs are bulgedominated systems. The correlation found between colours\nand morphologies suggests that the physical mechanism responsible for the colour properties could also operate transforming the galaxy morphologies.\n(iii) We find that \u223c 50% of the merging systems visually identified in our close galaxy pair catalogue inhabit\nintermediate local densities. We detect that, at this intermediate densities, a large fraction of mergers are red and\nbulge dominated. Particularly, 26% of these mergers are in\n\n\f11\nthe red ((u \u2212 r) > 2.8) tail while 24% are located at the blue\n((u \u2212 r) < 1.5) extreme.\n(iv) We have also investigated galaxy interactions at different halo masses in order to isolate the effects coming from\nthis environmental indicator. For low and high local densities, we detect an increase in the red fraction for increasing\ndark matter halo mass as expected, and with similar levels\nfor galaxies in pairs and in the control sample. However, at\nintermediate local densities and regardless of halo mass, we\nfind that the red fraction of systems in close pairs largely\nexceeds that of isolated systems in the control sample, up\nto \u223c 50% for the largest haloes. Under the hypothesis that\nthe red colours are produced by obscured SF due to dust\nstirring, triggered by the interaction, our results would be\nconsistent with those of Gallazzi et al. (2008) who actually\nfound an excess of obscured star formation at intermediate\nlocal densities. From a theoretical point of view, the larger\nexcess at intermediate local densities could be interpreted by\nthe findings of Kapferer et al. (2008) who claimed that the\nglobal SF rate of interacting systems is largely enhanced by a\nmoderate ram pressure stripping, in comparison to the same\ninteraction without the presence of an ambient medium.\nWe conclude that mergers and galaxy interactions are\nimportant processes in the regulation of galaxy properties, particularly at intermediate local density environments\nwhere these interactions seem to be more frequent. Although\nwe detect the action of the host DM halo in the steady increase of the red fraction as a function of halo mass, we also\nunveil a distinctive behaviour for galaxies in pairs at intermediate density environments. These regions could be considered as the locations where galaxies are pre-processed by\nmergers and close encounters that transform their colours\nand morphologies. Finally, we suggest that our findings\ncould also help to improve the modelling used in SAMS,\nparticularly regarding the effects of galaxy-galaxy interactions which are currently not included in most semi-analytic\nschemes.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was partially supported by the Consejo Nacional\nde Investigaciones Cient\u0131\u0301ficas y T\u00e9cnicas (PIP 6446) and\nAgencia Nacional de Promoci\u00f3n Cient\u0131\u0301fica y T\u00e9cnica (PICT\n32342 (2005) and PICT Max Planck 245 (2006).\n\nREFERENCES\nAlonso M.S., Tissera P.B., Coldwell G. & Lambas D.G, 2004,\nMNRAS 352, 1081\nAlonso M.S., Lambas D.G., Tissera P. and Coldwell G., 2006,\nMNRAS 367, 1029\nAlonso M.S., Lambas D.G., Tissera P. and Coldwell G., 2007,\nMNRAS 375, 1017\nBalogh M. et al., 2004, MNRAS 348, 1355\nBaldry et al., 2004, ApJ 600, 681.\nBarnes, J. & Hernquist L., 1996, ApJ, 471, 115.\nBarton E., Arnold J.A., Zentner A.R., Bullok J.S. and Wechsler\nR.H., 2007, ApJ 671, 1538\nBruzual G. and Charlot S., 2003, MNRAS, 344, 1000\nBrinchmann J., Chalot, S., White, S.D.M., Tremonti, C., Kauffmann, G. et al., 2004, MNRAS 351, 1151\nDe Lucia G. & Blazoit J., 2007, MNRAS 375, 2\n\nDe Propis R., Liske J., Driver S.P., Allen P.D. and Cross N.J.G.,\n2005, AJ 130, 1516\nDressler A., 1980, ApJ 236, 351\nEke V.R., Frenk C.S., Baugh C.M., Cole S., Norberg P. et al.\n(The 2dFGRS Team), 2004, MNRAS 355, 769\nEllison S.L.; Patton D.R.; Simard L.; McConnachie A.W.; 2008,\nAJ 135, 1877\nGallazzi, A.; Charlot, S.; Brinchmann, J.; White, S.D.M.;\nTremonti, C.A., 2005, MNRAS 362, 41\nGallazzi A., Bell E.F., Wolf C., Gray M.E., Papovich C. et al.,\n2008, (astro-ph/0809.2042)\nGeller M.J., Kenyon, S.J., Barton E.J., Jarrett T.H. & Kewley\nL.J., 2006, AJ 132, 2243\nGomez L.P., Nichol R.
