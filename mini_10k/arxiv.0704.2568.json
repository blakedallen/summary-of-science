The pioneering\npaper [3] showed that such hypothetical source of decoherence might become manifest in oscillating systems which propagate over macroscopical distances, through additional smearing\neffects in the observable interferometric pattern (besides the usual smearing effects due, e.g.,\nto the finite source size and the detector resolution). However, lacking an \"ab initio\" theory\nof quantum gravity decoherence, its effects can only be parameterized in a model-dependent\n(and somewhat arbitrary) way. Searches with neutral kaon oscillations [3, 4, 5, 6], neutron\ninterferometry [3, 7] and, more recently, neutrino oscillations [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], have\nfound no evidence for such effects so far, and have placed bounds on model parameters.\nQuantum gravity effects in neutrino systems have been investigated with increasing attention in the last decade, as a result of the evidence for neutrino flavor oscillations. Early attempts tried to interpret the solar neutrino puzzle [8, 9, 10] or the atmospheric \u03bd anomaly [10]\nin terms of decoherence. After the first convincing evidence for atmospheric neutrino oscillations [15], a quantitative analysis was performed in [11], considering possible decoherence\neffects in the \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc channel (see also [12]). The phenomenology of terrestrial neutrino\nexperiments has also been investigated in [13, 14]. More recently, prospective studies have\nfocused on decoherence effects in high energy neutrinos [16, 17, 18, 19, 20], observable in\nnext generation neutrino telescopes. Furthermore, more formal aspects of quantum gravity\ndecoherence in neutrino systems have been developed [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]. This is\nonly a fraction of the related literature, which testifies the wide and increasing interest in\nthe subject.\nDespite this interest, to our knowledge such decoherence effects have not been systematically investigated in the light of the solar neutrino experiments performed in the last few\nyears. Solar neutrino oscillations [28] dominated by matter effects [29, 30] are currently well\nestablished by solar neutrino experiments [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41] and have\nbeen independently confirmed by the long-baseline reactor experiment KamLAND [42, 43].\nThe striking agreement between solar and KamLAND results determines a unique solution\nin the mass-mixing parameter space [the so-called Large Mixing Angle (LMA) solution, see\ne.g. [44, 45]], provides indirect evidence for matter effects with standard amplitude [46], and\ngenerally (although not always [47]) implies that additional, non-standard physics effects\nmay play only a subleading role, if any. In particular, the KamLAND collaboration has\nexploited the observation of half oscillation cycle in the energy spectrum [43] to exclude\ndecoherence as a dominant explanation of their data.\nThe main purpose of this paper is then to study decoherence as a subdominant effect\nin solar and KamLAND neutrino oscillations. Modifications of the standard oscillation\nformulae in the presence of decoherence, and qualitative bounds on decoherence parameters,\nare discussed in Sec. II and III for KamLAND and solar neutrinos, respectively. Quantitative\nbounds on subdominant decoherence effects from a joint analysis of solar and KamLAND\ndata are studied in Sec. IV. Implications for decoherence induced by matter fluctuations in\nthe Sun are discussed in Sec. V. The main results are finally summarized in Sec. VI. The\nsolar neutrino flavor evolution in the presence of standard matter effects plus non-standard\ndecoherence is discussed in a technical Appendix.\n2\n\n\fII.\n\nOSCILLATIONS WITH(OUT) DECOHERENCE IN KAMLAND\n\nHere and in the following, we assume the standard notation [48] for neutrino mixing, and\nset the small mixing angle \u03b813 to zero for the sake of simplicity. For \u03b813 = 0, oscillations in\nthe \u03bde \u2192 \u03bde channel probed by long-baseline reactor (KamLAND) and by solar neutrinos\nare driven by only two parameters: the mixing angle \u03b812 and the neutrino squared mass\ndifference \u03b4m2 = m22 \u2212 m21 . In particular, the standard \u03bde survival probability over a baseline\nL in KamLAND reads:\n1\n\u03b4m2 L\nPee = 1 \u2212 sin2 2\u03b812 1 \u2212 cos\n2\n2E\n\n!!\n\n.\n\n(1)\n\nIn the presence of additional decoherence effects, the oscillating factor is exponentially\nsuppressed, as shown in [11] for the atmospheric \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc channel. By changing the appropriate parameters for the KamLAND \u03bde \u2192 \u03bde channel, the results of [11] lead to the\nfollowing modification of the previous equation,\n\u03b4m2 L\n1\nPee = 1 \u2212 sin2 2\u03b812 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b3L cos\n2\n2E\n\n!!\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the dimensional parameter \u03b3 represents the inverse of the decoherence length after\nwhich the neutrino system gets mixed.1 Equation (2) includes the limiting cases of pure\noscillations (\u03b3 = 0 and \u03b4m2 6= 0) and of pure decoherence (\u03b3 6= 0 and \u03b4m2 = 0).\nUnfortunately, lacking a fundamental theory for quantum gravity, the dependence of \u03b3\non the underlying dynamical and kinematical parameters (most notably the neutrino energy\nE) is unknown. Following common practice, such ignorance is parameterized in a power-law\nform\n\u0012\n\u0013\nE n\n\u03b3 = \u03b30\n,\n(3)\nE0\nwhere E0 is an arbitrary pivot energy scale, which we set as E0 = 1 GeV in order to facilitate\nthe comparison with limits on \u03b3-parameters investigated in other contexts (as reviewed, e.g.,\nin [49]). We shall consider only five possible integer exponents,\nn = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhich include the following cases of interest: The \"energy independent\" case (n = 0); the\n\"Lorentz invariant\" case [11] (n = \u22121); the case n = +2 that can arise in some D-brane\nor quantum-gravity models, in which \u03b30 \u223c O(E02/MPlanck ) \u223c 10\u221219 GeV is expected (see,\ne.g. [50]); and the case where decoherence might be induced by \"matter density fluctuations\"\nrather than by quantum gravity (n = \u22122, see Sec. V).\nAs previously remarked, the KamLAND collaboration [43] (see also [51]) has ruled out\npure decoherence in the Lorentz invariant case (n = \u22121). In our statistical \u03c72 analysis, we\nalso find that this case is rejected at 3.6\u03c3 (i.e., \u2206\u03c72 = 13 with respect to pure oscillations).\nIn addition, we find that the other exponents in Eq. (4) are also rejected at > 3\u03c3 for the pure\ndecoherence case. Therefore, decoherence effects can only be subdominant in KamLAND,\nnamely\n\u03b3L \u226a 1 .\n(5)\n1\n\nUnits: [\u03b3] = 1/length = energy. Conversion factor: (1 km)\u22121 = 1.97 \u00d7 10\u221219 GeV.\n\n3\n\n\fFor typical KamLAND neutrino energies (E \u223c few MeV) and baselines (L \u223c 2\u00d7102 km), the\nabove inequality implies upper bounds on \u03b30 , which range from \u03b30 \u226a 10\u221226 GeV (n = \u22122)\nto \u03b30 \u226a 10\u221216 GeV (n = +2). We do not refine the analysis of such bounds (placed by\nKamLAND alone), since they are superseded by solar data constraints, as shown in the next\nSection.\nIII. OSCILLATIONS WITH(OUT) DECOHERENCE EFFECTS IN SOLAR NEUTRINOS\n\nThe survival probability describing standard adiabatic \u03bde transitions in the solar matter\nis given by the simple formula (up to small Earth matter effects)\n\u2299\nPee\n=\n\n\u0011\n1\u0010\n1 + cos 2\u03b8\u030312 (r0 ) cos 2\u03b812 ,\n2\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03b8\u030312 (r0 ) is the energy-dependent effective mixing angle in matter at the production\nradius r0 (see, e.g., [52] and references therein).\nIn the presence of non-standard decoherence effects, we find that the energy dependent\nterm is modulated by an exponential factor,\n\u2299\nPee\n=\n\n\u0011\n1\u0010\n1 + e\u2212\u03b3\u2299 R\u2299 cos 2\u03b8\u030312 (r0 ) cos 2\u03b812 ,\n2\n\n(7)\n\nwhere R\u2299 = 6.96 \u00d7 105 km is the Sun radius, while \u03b3\u2299 is defined as\n\u03b3\u2299 = \u03b30 gn (E) ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere the dimensionless function gn (E) embeds, besides the power-law dependence E n , also\nthe information about the solar density profile [which is instead absent in Eq. (6)]. The\nreader is referred to the Appendix for a derivation of Eq. (7) and for details about the\nfunction gn (E).\nEquation (7) includes the subcase of pure oscillations (\u03b30 = 0 and \u03b4m2 6= 0), but not the\nsubcase of pure decoherence (\u03b30 6= 0 and \u03b4m2 = 0), since the limit \u03b4m2 \u2192 0 would entail\nstrongly nonadiabatic transitions, and thus a breakdown of the adiabatic approximation\nassumed above. However, as noted in the previous section, the KamLAND data exclude the\nlimit \u03b4m2 \u2192 0; moreover, they require \u03b4m2 values which are high enough to guarantee the\nvalidity of the adiabatic approximations, with or without subleading decoherence effects (as\nwe have numerically verified). Therefore, for solar neutrinos, the only phenomenologically\nrelevant cases are those including oscillations plus decoherence.2\nWe have analyzed all the available solar neutrino data with (\u03b4m2 , \u03b812 , \u03b30 ) taken as free\nparameters. It turns out that, despite the allowance for an extra degree of freedom (\u03b30 ), the\ndata always prefer the pure oscillations (\u03b30 = 0) as best fit, independently of the power-law\nindex in Eq. (4). Since there are no indications in favor of decoherence effects, the exponent\nin Eq. (7) is expected to be small,\n\u03b3\u2299 R\u2299 \u226a 1 .\n(9)\n2\n\n\u2299\nFor the sake of curiosity, we have anyway calculated Pee\nfor the pure decoherence case, by numerically\nsolving the neutrino evolution equations (discussed in the Appendix) for \u03b4m2 = 0 and \u03b3 6= 0.

Such bounds\nare two to four orders of magnitude stronger than those placed by KamLAND alone (see\nthe end of the previous Section). A useful complementarity then emerges between solar and\nKamLAND data in joint fits: The former dominate the constraints on decoherence effects,\nwhile the latter fix the mass-mixing parameters independently of (negligible) decoherence\neffects.\nIV. COMBINATION OF SOLAR AND KAMLAND DATA: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nWe have performed a joint analysis of solar and KamLAND data3 in the (\u03b4m2 , sin2 \u03b812 , \u03b30 )\nparameter space for the five power-law exponents n = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12. The main results are: (i)\n\u03b30 = 0 is always preferred at best fit, i.e., there is no indication in favor of decoherence effects;\n(ii) the best fit values and the marginalized bounds for (\u03b4m2 , sin2 \u03b812 ) do not appreciably\nchange from those obtained in the pure oscillation case, namely, \u03b4m2 = (7.92 \u00b1 0.71) \u00d7 10\u22125\neV2 and sin2 \u03b812 = (0.314+0.057\n\u22120.047 ) at \u00b12\u03c3 [44]; (iii) significant upper bounds can be set on\nthe decoherence parameter \u03b30 . Our limits on \u03b30 are given numerically in Table I (at the 2\u03c3\nlevel, \u2206\u03c72 = 4) and graphically in Fig. 1 (at 2\u03c3 and 3\u03c3 level). Such limits are consistent\nwith those discussed qualitatively after Eq. (9) in the previous Section.\nFigure 1 clearly shows that the bounds on \u03b30 scale with n almost exactly as a power law,\nchanging by about two decades for |\u2206n| = 1. The reason is that the bounds are dominated\nby solar neutrino data, and in particular by data probing the 8 B neutrinos in a relatively\nnarrow energy range around E \u223c 10 MeV; the power-law dependence assumed in Eq. (3)\nand embedded in the function gn (E) then implies that the parameter \u03b30 scales roughly as\n(E/E0 )\u2212n \u223c 102n .\nAlthough the case of no decoherence (\u03b30 = 0) is preferred, it makes sense to ask what\none should observe for decoherence effects as large as currently allowed by the data at, say,\n\u2299\nthe 2\u03c3 level. Figure 2 compares the Pee\nenergy profile for the cases of pure oscillations (left\n3\n\nThe details of the data set, of the solar model used [53] and of the statistical \u03c72 analysis have been\nreported in [44] and are not repeated here.\n\n5\n\n\fpanel) and of oscillations plus decoherence (right panel), where \u03b30 is taken equal to the upper\nbound at 2\u03c3, as taken from Table I.4 It can be seen that decoherence effects, to some extent,\nmimic the effects of a larger mixing. For instance, the curve with n = 0 in the right panel is\nnot much different from the curve at sin2 \u03b812 = 0.371 (upper 2\u03c3 value) in the left panel. As\na consequence, one expects some degeneracy between the parameters \u03b30 and sin2 \u03b812 when\nfitting the data. The degeneracy is only partial however, because decoherence effects can\nsignificantly change both the shape and the slope of the energy profile within the current\n2\u03c3 bounds, as evident in the right panel. Therefore, future measurements of the (currently\nnot well constrained) solar neutrino energy spectrum will provide further important probes\nof decoherence effects.\n\u2299\nThe variation of Pee\ndue to subdominant decoherence effects [see Eqs. (6) and (7)] is\ngiven, in first approximation, by\n1\n\u2299\n\u2206Pee\n\u2243 \u2212 \u03b3\u2299 R\u2299 cos 2\u03b8\u030312 cos 2\u03b812 ,\n2\n\n(10)\n\nand changes sign with cos 2\u03b8\u030312 . As the energy increases, the value of cos 2\u03b8\u030312 changes from\ncos \u03b812 > 0 (low-energy, vacuum-dominated regime) to \u22121 (high-energy, matter-dominated\nregime), the transition being located around 2 MeV for the 8 B neutrino curves shown in\n\u2299\n> 2 MeV in the right panel of\nFig. 2. This fact explains the general increase of Pee\nfor E \u223c\nFig. 2. More detailed features depend instead on the energy behavior of the function gn (E),\nwhich modulates decoherence effects (see the Appendix). In general, gn (E) grows rapidly\nwith increasing energy for n > 0 (which explains the high-energy upturn of the curves with\nn = +1 and n = +2), while it vanishes with decreasing energy for all n 6= \u22122 (which explains\nthe low-energy equality of all curves but for n = \u22122).5 The \"bunching\" of the curves around\nE \u223c 10 MeV in the right panel of Fig. 2 is in part a data selection effect, since this energy\nregion is strongly constrained by precise 8 B neutrino data. Further spectral 8 B data will\nbe very useful to constrain the slope of the energy spectrum and thus also the sign of the\npower-law index n.\nFigure 3 illustrates the partial degeneracy between decoherence effects and mixing angle,\nas a shift in the allowed regions for fixed \u03b30 6= 0 in three representative cases (from left\nto right, n = \u22122, 0, +2). In each panel, the thin dotted curves enclose the mass-mixing\nparameter regions allowed at 2\u03c3 by the standard oscillation fit of solar data (larger region)\nand by solar plus KamLAND data (smaller region). The thick solid curves refer to the\nsame data, but fixing a priori the decoherence parameter \u03b30 at the 2\u03c3 upper limit value\nin Table I. In all cases in Fig. 3, the curves with \u03b30 6= 0 are shifted to lower values of the\nmixing angle, as compared to pure oscillations; this means that decoherence effects can be\npartly traded for a smaller value of the mixing angle in solar neutrino oscillations. Therefore,\nshould future solar neutrino data prefer smaller (larger) values of sin2 \u03b812 with respect to\nKamLAND data, there would be more (less) room for possible subdominant decoherence\neffects. As already remarked, the degeneracy between \u03b30 and sin2 \u03b812 is only partial, and\nfuture neutrino spectroscopy will provide a further handle to break it, should decoherence\neffects (if any) be found.\n4\n\n5\n\nFor definiteness, Fig. 2 shows the daytime probability of 8 B neutrinos, averaged over their production\nregion in the Sun.\nConstraints on the specific case n = \u22122 might thus benefit of sub-MeV solar neutrino observations in\nBorexino [54].\n\n6\n\n\fWe conclude this section by confronting the bounds in Table I with those derivable from\nthe analysis of atmospheric neutrino data (which, by themselves, exclude pure decoherence,\nat least in the n = \u22121 case [55]). In principle, a direct comparison is not possible, since the\n\u03b30 parameter introduced here for the solar \u03bde \u2192 \u03bde channel does not need to be the same as\nfor the atmospheric \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc channel. However, if the \u03b30 's for these two channels are assumed\nto be roughly equal in size, then it is easy to realize that solar+KamLAND neutrinos set\nstronger (weaker) bounds than atmospheric neutrinos for n < 0 (n > 0), as a consequence\nof the different neutrino energy range probed. In fact, due to the assumed power-law energy\ndependence of decoherence effects, negative (positive) values of n are best probed by lowenergy solar (high-energy atmospheric) neutrino experiments. For the intermediate case\n(n = 0), it turns out that matter effects render solar neutrinos more sensitive to \u03b30 than\natmospheric neutrinos. Just to make specific numerical examples: for n = (\u22121, 0, +2) one\n< (0.7 \u00d7 10\u221221 , 0.4 \u00d7 10\u221222 , 0.9 \u00d7 10\u221227 ) GeV from atmospheric\nroughly gets the bounds \u03b30 \u223c\n[11] (plus accelerator [12]) neutrino data, to be compared with the corresponding limits from\nsolar+KamLAND data from Table I, \u03b30 < (0.78 \u00d7 10\u221226 , 0.67 \u00d7 10\u221224 , 0.47 \u00d7 10\u221220 ) GeV.\nSolar neutrinos clearly win over atmospheric neutrinos for n \u2264 0. This comparison must be\ntaken with a grain of salt, since it can radically change by assuming either independent \u03b30 's\nin different oscillation channels, or functional forms of \u03b3(E) different from power laws.\nFinally we observe that in the n = +2 case, motivated by some \"quantum-gravity\" or\n\"string-inspired\" models [50], the solar+KamLAND limit on \u03b30 is one order of magnitude\nlower than the theoretical expectation [\u03b30 \u223c O(E02/MPlanck ) \u223c 10\u221219 GeV]. In the case of\natmospheric neutrinos, this bound is even stronger (\u03b30 < 0.9 \u00d7 10\u221227 GeV). Consequently,\nthese models appear strongly disfavored, at least in the neutrino sector.\nV.\n\nRECOVERING THE CASE OF DENSITY FLUCTUATIONS IN THE SUN\n\nDecoherence effects in solar neutrino oscillations can be induced not only by quantum\ngravity, but also by more \"prosaic\" sources, such as matter density fluctuations-possibly\ninduced by turbulence in the innermost regions of the Sun. This topic has been widely\ninvestigated in the literature [56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65], and quantitative upper\nlimits have already been set [61, 62, 63, 64] by combining solar data and first KamLAND\nresults.\nIt turns out that stochastic density fluctuations lead (with appropriate redefinition of\nparameters) to effects which have the same functional form as those induced by quantum\ngravity in the n = \u22122 case. More precisely, let us consider fluctuations of the solar electron\ndensity Ne around the average value hNe i predicted by the standard solar model,\nNe (r) = (1 + \u03b2F (r))hNe (r)i,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere F (r) is a random variable describing fluctuations at a given radius r, and \u03b2 represents\ntheir fractional amplitude around the average. It is customary to assume a delta-correlated\n(white) noise,\nhF (r1)F (r2 )i = 2\u03c4 \u03b4(r1 \u2212 r2 ),\n(12)\nwhere \u03c4 is the correlation length of fluctuations along the (\u223c radial) neutrino direction.\nAs shown in [59] through a perturbative method (which inspired our approach to decoherence in the Appendix), the effect of delta-correlated noise on adiabatic neutrino flavor\n\n7\n\n\ftransitions can be embedded through an exponential damping factor as in Eq. (7). The functional form turns out to be the same as for the n = \u22122 case, provided that one makes-in\nour notation-the replacement\n!\n2 2\n\u03b4m\n\u03b30 \u2192 \u03b2 2 \u03c4\n.\n(13)\n2E0\nBy using the bound \u03b30 < 0.81 \u00d7 10\u221228 GeV (Table I, case n = \u22122) and the best-fit value\n\u03b4m2 = 7.92 \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 , one gets the following upper limit\n\u03b2 2 \u03c4 < 1.02 \u00d7 10\u22122 km (2\u03c3) ,\n\n(14)\n\non the parameter combination \u03b2 2 \u03c4 which is relevant [59, 63] for density fluctuation effects\non neutrino propagation.\nAs stressed in [63], care must be taken in extracting an upper limit on the fractional amplitude \u03b2 for fixed correlation length \u03c4 . Indeed, the delta-correlated noise is an acceptable\napproximation only if the correlation length \u03c4 is much smaller than the oscillation wavelength in matter-a condition that becomes critical for low neutrino energies. In particular,\nassuming a reference value \u03c4 = 10 km as in [63], such condition is violated for energies\n< 1 MeV. Following [63], we have thus excluded low-energy, radiochemical solar neutrino\nE\u223c\ndata form the solar+KamLAND data fit, and obtained a slightly weaker (but more reliable)\nupper bound from the analysis of 8 B neutrino data only,\n\u03b2 2 \u03c4 < 1.16 \u00d7 10\u22122 km (2\u03c3) ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhich, for \u03c4 = 10 km, translates into an upper limit on the fractional fluctuation amplitude,\n\u03b2 < 3.4% (2\u03c3) .\n\n(16)\n\nThis limit improves the previous one derived in [63] (\u03b2 < 6.3% at 2\u03c3) by a factor of \u223c 2,\nessentially as a result of the inclusion of the most recent solar and KamLAND neutrino data\nappeared after [63].6\nVI.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper, we have investigated hypothetical decoherence effects (e.g., induced by\nquantum gravity) in the \u03bde \u2192 \u03bde oscillation channel explored by the solar and KamLAND\nexperiments. In both kinds of of experiments, decoherence effects can be embedded through\nexponential damping factors, proportional to a common parameter \u03b30 , which modulate the\nenergy-dependent part of the \u03bde survival probability. By assuming that the (unknown)\nfunctional form of decoherence effects is a power-law in energy (E n ), we have studied the\nphenomenological constraints on the main decoherence parameter (\u03b30 ) for n = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12.\nIt turns out that both solar and KamLAND data do not provide indications in favor of\ndecoherence effects and prefer the standard oscillation case (\u03b30 = 0) for any index n. By\ncombining the two data sets, n-dependent upper bounds (dominated by solar neutrino data)\n6\n\nWe have verified that, by adopting the same (older) data set and standard solar model as used in [63], we\nrecover the same 2\u03c3 upper limit, \u03b2 <\n\u223c 6%.\n\n8\n\n\fhave been derived on \u03b30 , as reported in Table I and shown in Fig. 1. In the \"Lorentzinvariant\" case n = \u22121, we obtain the upper limit \u03b30 < 0.78 \u00d7 10\u221226 GeV at 95% C.L. For\nn = \u22122, the results can also be interpreted as limits on the amplitude of possible (deltacorrelated) density fluctuations in the Sun, which we improve by a factor of two [Eqs. (15)\nand (16)] with respect to previous bounds.\nFurther progress might come from a better determination of the energy profile of solar\nneutrino flavor transitions as well as from more precise measurements of sin2 \u03b812 (which\nis partly degenerate with \u03b30 ), attainable with KamLAND and future long-baseline reactor\nneutrino experiments [66].\nAPPENDIX: DECOHERENCE AND MATTER EFFECTS IN SOLAR NEUTRINOS\n\nIn this section we discuss a perturbative calculation of decoherence effects for solar neutrinos, where matter effects are known to be relevant. The approach, inspired by the work [59],\ndraws on the formalism and the notation introduced in [11] for the case of decoherence in\nthe \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc channel, here adapted to the \u03bde \u2192 \u03bde channel. In the following, the the notation\n\u2299\nis made more compact by setting \u03b8 = \u03b812 , c2\u03b8 = cos 2\u03b812 , s2\u03b8 = sin 2\u03b812 , Pee = Pee\netc.\nDecoherence effects in the flavor evolution of the (\u03bde , \u03bda ) system (where a = \u03bc, \u03c4 ) along\nthe space coordinate r(\u2243 t)7 can be described in terms of the neutrino density matrix,\nobeying a modified master equation of the form [67]\nd\u03c1\n= \u2212i[Hv + Hm (r), \u03c1] \u2212 \u03b3[D, [D, \u03c1]] ,\ndr\n\n(17)\n\nwhere Hv (Hm ) is the \"vacuum\" (matter) Hamiltonian, and the operator D embeds decoherence effects with amplitude \u03b3, parameterized as in Eq. (3): \u03b3 = \u03b30 (E/E0 )n with\nE0 = 1 GeV. While unitarity is preserved (i.e., Tr\u03c1(r) = 1), coherence is lost in the propad\ngation ( dr\nTr\u03c12 \u2264 0). Equation (17) satisfies the conditions of complete positivity [68] and\nnon-decreasing entropy in the \u03bd system evolution [69].\nIn the flavor basis the standard oscillation terms read\nk\nk\nHv = \u2212 U\u03b8 \u03c33 U\u03b8\u2020 =\n2\n2\nV (r)\nHm = \u2212\n\u03c33 ,\n2\n\n\"\n\n\u2212c2\u03b8 s2\u03b8\ns2\u03b8 c2\u03b8\n\n#\n\n,\n\n(18)\n(19)\n\nwhere \u03c33 is the third Pauli matrix, k = \u03b4m2 /2E is the vacuum wavenumber, and V (r) =\n\u221a\n2GF Ne (r) is the interaction potential in matter.\nAs in [11], we assume energy conservation for evolution in vacuum, i.e., Tr[Hv \u03c1(r)] = constant. This condition is satisfied if [Hv , D] = 0 [4, 70], namely, in a two-dimensional system,\nif D \u221d Hv . We can thus take\n\"\n#\n1 \u2212c2\u03b8 s2\u03b8\nD\u03b8 =\n,\n(20)\n2 s2\u03b8 c2\u03b8\n7\n\nNote that r does not necessarily coincide with the radial coordinate, due to the extended neutrino production region (which is taken into account in our analysis.)\n\n9\n\n\fwithout loss of generality, since any overall factor can be absorbed in \u03b30 . We also make the\nplausible assumption that Eq. (20) is not altered for evolution in matter, since decoherence\ninduced by quantum gravity is unrelated to electroweak matter effects.\nAs usual, Eq. (17) can be written in terms of a \"polarization\" vector P with components\nPi = 12 Tr[\u03c1\u03c3i ] (Bloch equation):\ndP\n= [kn + V (r)e3 ] \u00d7 P \u2212 \u03b3P\u22a5\ndr\n= H(r)P \u2212 \u03b3D\u03b8 P\n\n(21)\n\nwhere n = [s2\u03b8 , 0, \u2212c2\u03b8 ]T , P\u22a5 = P \u2212 (P * n)n, and:\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8ee\n\n0\n\u2212V (r) + kc2\u03b8\n0\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\nH(r) = \uf8f0 V (r) \u2212 kc2\u03b8\n0\n\u2212ks2\u03b8 \uf8fa\n\uf8fb ,\n0\nks2\u03b8\n0\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8ee\n\nc22\u03b8 0 c2\u03b8 s2\u03b8\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\nD\u03b8 = \uf8ef\n1 0 \uf8fa\n\uf8fb .\n\uf8f0 0\n2\nc2\u03b8 s2\u03b8 0 s2\u03b8\n\n(22)\n\n(23)\n\nNote that for V = 0 (vacuum propagation), the solution of the above Bloch equation leads\nto the survival probability in Eq.

For E \u2192 0 the function gn (E) (and the\nassociated decoherence effect) vanishes, except for the case n = \u22122, where the factors E \u22122\nand k \u22122 cancel out and provide a finite limit g\u22122 (0) 6= 0.\nWe have tested the analytical Eq. (28) against the results of a numerical integration of\nthe Bloch equation, for many representative points in the parameter space relevant for solar\n\u03bd phenomenology, and we find very good agreement (\u03b4Pee < 10\u22124) for all values of n 6= \u22122.\nOnly in the case n = \u22122, the comparison of analytical and numerical results is slightly\nworse (but still very good, \u03b4Pee < 10\u22123 ) at the lowest detectable energies (\u223c 0.1 MeV),\ndue to the breakdown of perturbation theory for E \u2192 0. For practical purposes, however,\nthe modified adiabatic Eq. (28) accurately replaces the results of numerical solutions of the\nBloch equation for solar neutrinos.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe work of G.L. Fogli, E. Lisi, A. Marrone, and D.

The solid and dotted curves\nrefer to 2\u03c3 and 3\u03c3 confidence level, respectively.\n\n15\n\n\fFIG. 2: Energy profile of the (daytime) survival probability of 8 B neutrinos, averaged over their\nproduction region in the sun: Comparison of the effects produced by variations of sin2 \u03b812 for\n\u03b30 = 0 (left panel) and by \u03b30 6= 0 at fixed sin2 \u03b812 (right panel). In the left panel, sin2 \u03b812 is varied\nwithin its \u00b12\u03c3 limits. In the right panel, for each index n = [\u22122, \u22121, 0, +1, +2] the value of \u03b30 is\ntaken equal to the corresponding 2\u03c3 upper limit (reported in Table I), which in units of 10\u221224 GeV\ncorresponds respectively to: 0.81 \u00d7 10\u22124 (n = \u22122), 0.78 \u00d7 10\u22122 (n = \u22121), 0.67 (n = 0), 0.58 \u00d7 102\n(n = +1), 0.47 \u00d7 104 (n = +2). The curve corresponding to standard oscillations (\u03b30 = 0) is also\nshown in the right panel as a guide to the eye. In all cases, \u03b4m2 is fixed at its best-fit value.\n\n16\n\n\fFIG. 3: Constraints on the mass-mixing parameters for \u03b30 = 0 (thin dotted curves) and for \u03b30\nfixed at its 2\u03c3 upper limit in Table I (thick solid curves). The three panels refer, from left to\nright, to the three cases n = \u22122, 0, and +2. The smaller (larger) allowed regions refer to the\nsolar+KamLAND (solar only) data analysis.\n\n17\n\n\fFIG. 4: Energy profile of the auxiliary function gn (E), which modulates the exponent of the\ndamping factor induced by decoherence in solar neutrino oscillations. The function is multiplied\nby 103n for a better graphical view. The shown function refers to a neutrino produced at the Sun\ncenter and to best-fit oscillation parameters; altering this choice would induce minor variations.\nSee the text for details.\n\n18\n\n\f"}
