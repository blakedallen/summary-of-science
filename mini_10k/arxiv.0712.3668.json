The monitored sample included 160\nBHB and 107 EHB stars, respectively. A total of 17 variables were detected of\nwhich 14 are new identifications. Five variables are BHB/EHB stars. We report\nalso on identification of a detached eclipsing binary being likely a member of\nthe cluster. Moreover, we detected an outburst of a dwarf nova located in the\ncluster core.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nNGC 6752 is a nearby post core-collapsed globular cluster. In his compilation Harris (1996) lists for it (m \u2212 M )V = 13.02 and E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.04. The\ncluster harbors a rich population of blue horizontal branch (BHB) and extreme horizontal branch (EHB) stars (Buonanno et al. 1986; Momany et al.\n2002). The photometric survey conducted with the 1-m Swope telescope by the\nCASE group (Thompson et al. 1999) resulted in detection of 3 SX Phe stars\nand 8 eclipsing binaries in the cluster field. So far none of the blue stars in\nNGC 6752 is a known photometric variable. This is a bit unexpected in light of\nthe idea that most or even all EHB stars are components of close binary systems\n(Mengel, Norris, & Gross 1976; Heber et al. 2002). Close binaries are common\namong field EHB stars (Maxted et al. 2001; Napiwotzki et al. 2004). On the\nother hand Moni Bidin et al. (2006) detected no spectroscopic binaries among\n51 BHB/EHB stars in NGC 6752. Further evidence for a lack of close binaries\namong EHB stars in globular clusters was presented during this conference by\nMoni Bidin.\nIn this contribution we present results of a new survey for photometric variables\nin NGC 6752. It covers smaller area than our earlier work but is deeper and\nbetter suited for study of the innermost region of the cluster.\n2.\n\nObservations and Reductions\n\nThe central part of the cluster was observed with the 2.5-m DuPont telescope\nduring 8 consecutive nights in May 1998. The 20482 TEK5 CCD camera was\n1\n\n\f2\n\nJ. Kaluzny & I.B. Thompson\n\nused as a detector with a scale of 0.26 arcsec/pixel and field of view of 8.8 \u00d7 8.8\narcmin2 . The cluster was monitored for a total of 30 hours with B & V filters.\nThe average exposure times were 35s and 60s for V and B filters, respectively.\nSuch rather short exposure times helped to avoid saturation of too many stars\nin the dense core region of the cluster. The sequences of 2-4 individual images\nwere combined to improve the signal to noise ratio and to speed up data reductions. The results presented here are based on 152 combined images in V and\n143 combined images in B. Effective resolution of the data ranges from 4 to 8\nminutes.\nPhotometric reductions were conducted using Daophot/Allstar (Stetson 1987)\nand ISIS (Alard & Lupton 1998) packages. The light curves for about 30 000\nstars were extracted and analyzed for variability using AoV and AOVTRANS\nprograms (Schwarzenberg-Czerny 1996; Schwarzenberg-Czerny & Beaulieu 2006).\n3.\n\nResults\n\nWe detected 17 variable stars of which 14 are new identifications. Location of\n15 of them is marked on the color magnitude-diagram of the cluster shown in\nFig. 1.\n\nFigure 1.\n\nColor-magnitude diagram of NGC 6752 with marked variables.\n\nStars B1 and B3-5 are candidate BHB/EHB objects. As for variable B2 it is\na likely binary containing BHB/EHB star and a redder companion. Time domain\n\n\fVariability of EHB stars in NGC 6752\n\nFigure 2.\n\nV-band light curves of variables B1-2 and B4.\n\nFigure 3.\n\nV-band light curves of variables B3 and B5.\n\nFigure 4.\n\nB-band light curve of a candidate dwarf nova.\n\n3\n\n\f4\n\nJ. Kaluzny & I.B. Thompson\n\nlight curves of B1, B2 and B4 are shown in Fig. 2. Light curve of B2 shows likely\nperiodicity with P \u2248 3.3 d or P \u2248 6.6 d. It is possible that all 3 objects are\nbinaries and that their variability is due to ellipsoidal and/or reflecting effect.\nLight curves of B3 and B5 can be phased with periods P = 0.69 d and P = 047 d,\nrespectively. Their phased light curves are shown in Fig. 3. The light curve of\nB3 is asymmetric which suggests that it is a pulsating variable. However, the\nobserved period is too long as for pulsating sdB star. As for B5 we propose, based\non its faintness and observed period, that it is related to cataclysmic variables.\nWe note parenthetically that B5 is also a UV bight object with U \u2212 B \u2248 \u22121.0.\nAs for the remaining variables we would like to higlight a detection of a detached\neclipsing binary which is located on the cluster main sequence. On Fig. 1 this\nvariable is labeled as EA. We detected only one eclipse for it with a depth of\nabout 0.2 mag in the V-band. The eclipse seems to be total. Detailed analysis\nof this object can provide a direct determination of absolute parameters for two\nmain sequence stars belonging to the cluster. Finally, we report on a detection\nof a possible dwarf nova outburst for an object located right at the cluster core.\nOnly B band light curve could be extracted for it. Photometry in the V band\nwas impossible due to a presence of a nearby bright stars with saturated images.\nThe light curve of the candidate dwarf nova is shown in Fig. 4.\nPooley et al. (2002) reported detection of several X-ray sources in the core of\nNGC 6752. It remains to be checked if any of these sources corresponds to the\nobject which showed an optical outburst. More detailed analysis of all detected\nvariables will be presented soon. In particular we plan an extraction of light\ncurves based on individual images rather than on stacked frames. Moreover, we\nare aiming at spectroscopic follow up of selected variables. Spectroscopic data\nwill allow in particular to check on the binary nature of detected blue variables.\nAcknowledgments.
