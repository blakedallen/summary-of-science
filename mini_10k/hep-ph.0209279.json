But until now the symmetric breaking\nstructure of the electroweak interactions has not yet been directly explored experimentally. So\nthe exploration of the SM Higgs boson is a major goal of the present and future colliders. As we\nknow, any enlargement of the Higgs sector beyond the single SU (2)L Higgs doublet of the MSM\nnecessarily introduces other neutral Higgs bosons and charged Higgs bosons. Like the general\ntwo-Higgs-doublet model(2HDM), the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) [3] [4]\nrequires the introduction of two Higgs doublets in order to preserve supersymmetry. These\ntwo Higgs doublets predict some more elementary Higgs bosons: one CP-even neutral Higgs\nboson(H 0 ), one CP-odd neutral Higgs boson(A0 ) and two charged Higgs bosons(H \u00b1 ), which are\nabsent in the MSM. Any experimental discovery of these non-SM-like Higgs bosons will be the\ndirect verification of these extended versions of the Higgs sector. Therefore, the study of various\nproduction mechanisms of the non-SM-like Higgs bosons at the present and future colliders is\nwell motivated.\nSearching for the non-SM-like Higgs bosons and studying their properties at the future multiTeV hadron colliders, such as the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), are possible as expected\nby supersymmetric (SUSY) theory [3] [5]. The gluon fusion mechanism gg \u2192 \u03c6(\u03c6 = h0 , H 0 , A0 )\nprovides the dominant production mechanism of neutral Higgs bosons at the LHC in the entire\nrelevant mass range up to about 1 TeV for the small and moderate values of tan \u03b2 in the MSSM\n\n2\n\n\f[6]. The heavy neutral Higgs boson can be also produced in pair (A0 A0 , A0 h0 , A0 H 0 ) at the\nLHC, if it is kinematically allowed [7]. Studying the process of a heavy charged Higgs boson\nassociated with W boson is another attractive way in searching for the H \u00b1 bosons, because the\nW \u00b1 -boson's leptonic decay may be used as a spectacular trigger. The calculations of the heavy\nH \u00b1 production associated with W \u2213 boson at a future electron-positron collider can be found\nin Refs. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12]. The complete calculations of the H \u00b1 W \u2213 associated production\nat hadron colliders both in the 2HDM and the MSSM are given in Refs. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17].\nAnalogously, A0 Z 0 associated production would also be an efficient way in searching for the\nheavy neutral CP-odd Higgs boson A0 . Although the A0 boson can be produced in pair at future\ncolliders [7] [18], the A0 Z 0 associated production will be the kinematically favored mechanism\nto produce A0 Higgs boson for the heavy A0 Higgs boson. And again the leptonic decay of Z 0\nmaybe benefit for triggering the Z 0 A0 associated production events. The calculations of the\nZ 0 A0 associated production at a electron-positron collider were presented in Refs. [19] [20], at\na muon collider in Ref. [21] and at a photon collider in Ref. [22], respectively. And Chung\nKao gave the calculation of A0 Z 0 associated production via gg fusion including only quark loop\ndiagrams at the SSC [23].\nIn this paper we concentrate on studying the A0 Z 0 associated production at the LHC in\nthe MSSM, considering both subprocesses q q\u0304 \u2192 A0 Z 0 and gg \u2192 A0 Z 0 . In the calculation of\nthe loop mediated process pp \u2192 gg \u2192 A0 Z 0 , we compare and discuss the cross sections in\nthe general two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) and the MSSM. In section II, we present the\ncalculation of the processes pp \u2192 q q\u0304 \u2192 A0 Z 0 and pp \u2192 gg \u2192 A0 Z 0 . Numerical results and\n3\n\n\fdiscussion are given in section III. There we use the MSSM parameters constrained within the\nminimal supergravity (mSUGRA) scenario [24]. Finally, a short summary is given.\n\nII\n\nCross Section Calculation\n\nIn our calculation we use the t'Hooft-Feynman gauge and adopt the dimension regularization\nscheme in the general 2HDM and the dimensional reduction (DR) scheme [25] in the MSSM.\nIn the loop diagram calculation we adopted the definitions of one-loop integral functions in\nreference [26]. The numerical calculation of the vector and tensor loop integral functions can\nbe traced back to scalar loop integrals as shown in the reference[27]. The Feynman diagrams\nand the relevant amplitudes are created by FeynArts package automatically [28]. The numerical\ncalculation of the loop integrals are implemented by using Mathematica programs.\n\nII.1\n\nCalculation of the subprocess q q\u0304 \u2192 A0 Z 0 + X\n\nWe denote the A0 Z 0 associated production via Drell-Yan subprocess as\nq(p1 ) + q\u0304(p2 ) \u2192 Z 0 (k1 ) + A0 (k2 ),\n\n(2.1)\n\nDue to the feature of the Yukawa coupling that the coupling strength between quarks and\nHiggs boson is in proportion to the correspondent quark mass, the cross sections of subprocesses\nq q\u0304 \u2192 A0 Z 0 (q = u, d, s, c) should be much smaller than those of the subprocesses tt\u0304(bb\u0304) \u2192 A0 Z 0 .\nConsidering the fact that the luminosity of top (anti-top) quark is much lower than that of\nbottom (anti-bottom) quark from a proton, we conclude that the cross section of the process\npp \u2192 q q\u0304 \u2192 A0 Z 0 + X is approximately equal to the cross section of pp \u2192 bb\u0304 \u2192 A0 Z 0 + X.\n4\n\n\fTherefore, in this paper we consider only the contributions from the pp \u2192 bb\u0304 \u2192 A0 Z 0 + X\nprocess.\nThe Feynman diagrams of the subprocess bb\u0304 \u2192 A0 Z 0 at the lowest order are depicted in\nFig.1. The differential cross section of the subprocess bb\u0304 \u2192 A0 Z 0 can be expressed as\nd\u03c3\u0302bb\u0304 = dP2f\n\n1 X\n|A(a) (\u015d, t\u0302, \u00fb) + A(b) (\u015d, t\u0302, \u00fb)|2 ,\n12\n\n(2.2)\n\nspin\n\nwhere the summation is taken over the spins of the initial and final states, and dP2f denotes the\ntwo-particle phase space element. The factor 1/12 in above equation comes from the averaging\nover the spins and the colors of the incoming partons. The matrix element A(a) represents the\namplitude of the h0 (H 0 ) exchanging s-channel diagrams(shown in Fig.1(a)), A(b) corresponds to\nthe amplitude of u- and t-channel diagrams (shown in Fig.1(b)). The Mandelstam kinematical\nvariables are defined as\n\u015d = (p1 + p2 )2 ,\n\nt\u0302 = (p1 \u2212 k1 )2 ,\n\n\u00fb = (p1 \u2212 k2 )2 ,\n\n(2.3)\n\nBy using the relevant Feynman rules, we obtain the explicit expressions of these amplitudes:\n(4\u03c0\u03b1)mb\n(k1 + p1 + p2 )\u03bc\nsin \u03b1 \u03bc\n\u01eb\n(k\n)\n[v\u0304(p\n)u(p\n)]\ncos(\u03b2\n\u2212\n\u03b1)\n1\n2\n1\ncos \u03b2\n4s2W c2W\n\u015d \u2212 m2h + mh \u0393h i\n(4\u03c0\u03b1s )mb\n(k1 + p1 + p2 )\u03bc\ncos \u03b1 \u03bc\n\u2212\n\u01eb\n(k\n)\n[v\u0304(p\n)u(p\n)]\nsin(\u03b2\n\u2212\n\u03b1)\n(2.4)\n1\n2\n1\ncos \u03b2\n4s2w c2W\n\u015d \u2212 m2H + mH \u0393H i\n\u0015\n\u0014\n2\nPL\n1\n(4\u03c0\u03b1)mb\n5\n\u03bc sW\n\u03bc\n\u2212\n)u(p1 )\nv\u0304(p2 )\u03b3 (mb \u2212 /k1 + p\n/1 )\u03b3 (\ntan \u03b2\u01eb (k1 )\nA(b) (\u015d, t\u0302, \u00fb) = \u2212\n3\n2\n2mW s2W cW\nt\u0302 \u2212 m2b\n\u0015\n\u0014\n2\n(4\u03c0\u03b1)mb\nPL\n1\n\u03bc\n5\n\u03bc sW\n\u2212\n\u2212\n)u(p1 )\ntan \u03b2\u01eb (k1 )\nv\u0304(p2 )\u03b3 (mb + k\n/1 \u2212 /p2 )\u03b3 (\n3\n2\n2mW s2W cW\n\u00fb \u2212 m2b\n\nA(a) (\u015d, t\u0302, \u00fb) = \u2212\n\nwhere mb and mW represent the masses of bottom quark and W boson, respectively.\n5\n\n\fII.2\n\nCalculation of the subprocess gg \u2192 A0 Z 0 + X\n\nWe denote the A0 Z 0 associated production process via gluon fusions as\ng(p1 , \u03b1) + g(p2 , \u03b2) \u2192 Z 0 (k1 ) + A0 (k2 ),\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2 are the color indices of initial gluons. As the subprocess gg \u2192 Z 0 A0 is loop-induced,\nthe one-loop order calculation can be simply carried out by summing all unrenormalized reducible\nand irreducible one-loop diagrams and the results will be finite and gauge invariant. We denote\n2HDM and \u03c3 M SSM as the cross sections in the framework of the general 2HDM and the MSSM,\n\u03c3gg\ngg\n\nrespectively. The former is contributed by the Feynman diagrams involving only the quark loop\ndiagrams(shown in Fig.2) and the latter involves the contributions of both the quark and squark\nloop diagrams(shown in Fig.2-3). The possible corresponding Feynman diagrams created by\nexchanging the initial gluons or the two final states, should be also included in Fig.2 and Fig.3\nand involved in our calculation .\nWe can see that each Feynman diagram in Fig.2 and Fig.3 contains one interacting vertex\nbetween (s)quarks and a Higgs boson. Due to the feature of the Yukawa coupling as we mentioned\nabove, we can consider only the diagrams which involve the third generation (s)quark in the\ncalculation of the subprocess gg \u2192 A0 Z 0 .

The total cross section of pp \u2192 A0 Z 0 +X at proton-proton\ncollider should be the summation of \u03c3bb\u0304 and \u03c3gg . Quantitatively comparing the \u03c3bb\u0304 with \u03c3gg\nwill help us to know in which part of the parameter space the contribution of gluon-gluon fusion\nprocess is dominant.\n\nIII\nIII.1\n\nNumerical result and discussion\nInput parameters\n\nIn the numerical calculation, we take the SM parameters as: mt = 174.3 GeV, mb = 4.2 GeV,\nmZ = 91.187 GeV, \u0393Z = 2.49 GeV [31], and take the supersymmetric parameters being constrained within the minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) scenario [24]. In this scenario, only five\nsypersymmetric parameters should be inputed, namely M1/2 , M0 , A0 , sign of \u03bc and tan \u03b2, where\nM1/2 , M0 and A0 are the universal gaugino mass, scalar mass at GUT scale and the trilinear soft\nbreaking parameter in the superpotential terms, respectively. In this work, we take M1/2 =120\nGeV, A0 =300 GeV and \u03bc > 0. M0 is obtained quantitatively from the input mA value. All\nother MSSM parameters are determined in the mSUGRA scenario by using program package\nISAJET 7.44. In this program, the renormalization group equations (RGE's) [32] are run from\n\n8\n\n\fthe weak scale mZ up to the GUT scale, taking all thresholds into account in order to get the\nlow energy scenario from the mSUGRA. It uses two loop RGE's only for the gauge couplings\nand the one-loop RGE's for the other supersymmetric parameters. The GUT scale boundary\nconditions are imposed and the RGE's are run back to mZ , again taking threshold into account.\nHere we give some comments about the choice of the decay width values of CP-even neutral\nHiggs bosons h0 and H 0 . We know that some of the Feynman diagrams (shown in Fig.1-3) have\ns-channel h0 and H 0 propagators, which have analytical expressions respectively as\n\u015d \u2212 im2h \u2212 mh \u0393h\n1\n,\n=\n\u015d \u2212 m2h + imh \u0393h\n(\u015d \u2212 m2h )2 + m2h \u03932h\n\n(3.1)\n\n\u015d \u2212 m2H \u2212 imH \u0393H\n1\n,\n=\n\u015d \u2212 m2H + imH \u0393H\n(\u015d \u2212 m2H )2 + m2H \u03932H\n\n(3.2)\n\nIt is clear that the cross sections of the subprocess should related to the decay widths of h0 and\nH 0 . In this work the input parameter mA is taken in the range of 200 GeV to 650 GeV. Then\nwe have the following constraints in this parameter space,\nmH \u2248 mA ,\n\nmh < 150 GeV,\n\n(3.3)\n\nand by using the package HDECAY[33] in the MSSM, we find\n\u0393H , \u0393h < 10 GeV.\nBecause\n\n\u221a\n\n(3.4)\n\n\u015d \u2265 mA + mZ , we get (\u015d \u2212 m2H )2 \u226b m2H \u03932H . The propagator of H 0 boson can be\n\nexpressed approximately as\n\u015d \u2212 m2H \u2212 imH \u0393H\n1\n\u2248\n2\n2\n2\n2\n(\u015d \u2212 mH ) + mH \u0393H\n(\u015d \u2212 m2H )\n9\n\n(3.5)\n\n\fIt is obvious that the bigger the\n\n\u221a\n\n\u015d is, the less sensitive the cross section to the decay widths\n\nof neutral Higgs bosons H 0 and h0 is. Therefore, we choose \u0393H = \u0393h = 10 GeV in our\nnumerical calculations. Actually, our final numerical result of the cross section of the process\npp \u2192 A0 Z 0 + X at the LHC, shows also that it is not sensitive to the choice of these two decay\nwidths.\n\nIII.2\n\nDiscussion and analysis\n\nThe figures in Fig.4, Fig.5 and Fig.6, show the cross sections (or differential cross sections) of the\nprocess pp \u2192 gg \u2192 A0 Z 0 + X at the LHC as the functions of the CP-odd Higgs boson A0 mass,\nthe ratio of the vacuum expectation values tan \u03b2 and the transverse momentum pT , respectively.\nThe curves of the cross sections (or differential cross sections) involving the contributions from\nquark loop diagrams (in the general 2HDM) and quark+squark loop diagrams (in the MSSM)\nare depicted separately on these figures for comparison of the cross sections in these two models.\n2HDM (or d\u03c3 2HDM /dp ), the dotted-lines are\nAnd in these three figures the full-lines are for \u03c3gg\nT\ngg\nM SSM (or d\u03c3 M SSM /dp ).\nfor \u03c3gg\nT\ngg\n\nFigure 4 shows the relationship between the cross section of the parent process pp \u2192 gg \u2192\nA0 Z 0 + X and mA with the colliding energy\n\n\u221a\n\ns = 14 TeV. The input mSUGRA parameters\n\nare set to be the typical values mentioned in the last subsection (i.e. M1/2 =120 GeV, A0 =300\nGeV and \u03bc > 0. M0 is obtained quantitatively from the mA value), and tan \u03b2=2, 7 and\n32, respectively. From this figure, we find that in some parameter space the scalar quark\nM SSM > \u03c3 2HDM , while\ncontributions can enhance the cross section obviously, that is to say \u03c3gg\ngg\nM SSM < \u03c3 2HDM . The figure shows that when we have small and\nin other regions, we have \u03c3gg\ngg\n\n10\n\n\fmoderate tan \u03b2 values, the scalar quark loop contribution to the A0 Z 0 associated production\nat the LHC is most obvious. We shall also see later from Fig.7 that when tan \u03b2 has small or\nmoderate value, the contributions from gluon fusion subprocess is dominant. Therefore, it is\npossible to use the experimental measurement of the A0 Z 0 associated production at the LHC\nto disentangle the MSSM from the general 2HDM in these parameter space regions.\nIn Fig.5, the cross section of the parent process pp \u2192 gg \u2192 A0 Z 0 + X at the LHC versus\ntan \u03b2 is plotted. The values of the neutral CP-odd Higgs boson A0 mass are set to be 200 GeV,\n400 GeV and 600 GeV, respectively. From the figure, we also find that scalar quark contributions\ncan either enhance or suppress the cross section of the parent process as shown in Fig.4. Fig.5\ntogether with Fig.4, show that when the value of mA is greater than 400 GeV and tan \u03b2 < 8, the\ncontribution from the scalar quark loop diagrams increases with the decrement of tan \u03b2. In Fig.5\nthe two curves for mA = 400 GeV and 600 GeV demonstrate that when tan \u03b2 < 8, the scalar\nM SSM < \u03c3 2HDM , and while the\nquark contribution suppresses the cross section, which means \u03c3gg\ngg\n\nscalar quark contribution enhances the cross section when tan \u03b2 > 20. These features can be\nM SSM is about two\nalso seen from Fig.4. The curve for tan \u03b2 = 2 in Fig.4, demonstrates that \u03c3gg\n2HDM quantitatively, while the curve for tan \u03b2 = 32 shows \u03c3 M SSM > \u03c3 2HDM .\nthird of \u03c3gg\ngg\ngg\n\nFig.6 displays the differential cross section d\u03c3/dpT of the process pp \u2192 gg \u2192 A0 Z 0 at the\nLHC versus transverse momentum pT with\n\n\u221a\ns = 14 T eV and the pseudo-rapidity being in\n\nthe range of |\u03b7| < 2. The A0 mass is set to be 350 GeV, and tan \u03b2 is taken as 2, 7 and 32,\nrespectively. We find that for tan \u03b2 = 2, the scalar quark contribution suppresses the differential\ncross section d\u03c3/dpT . For tan \u03b2 = 32 and pT > 100 GeV, the scalar quark contribution enhances\n\n11\n\n\fthe differential cross section. But for tan \u03b2 = 7, the scalar quark contribution can either enhance\nor suppress the differential cross section in different pT regions.\nIn Fig.7, Fig.8 and Fig.9, we plot the the cross sections of the process pp \u2192 bb\u0304 \u2192 A0 Z 0 + X\n(\u03c3 (DY ) ), and the process pp \u2192 A0 Z 0 + X contributions from both Drell-Yan and gluon-gluon\nM SSM ), as the functions of\nfusion subprocesses in the constrained MSSM (\u03c3 (T ) = \u03c3 (DY ) + \u03c3gg\n\nthe CP-odd Higgs boson A0 mass, the ratio of the vacuum expectation values tan \u03b2 and the\ntransverse momentum pT , respectively. In these three figures, the full-lines are for the cross\nsections or differential cross sections of the process pp \u2192 bb\u0304 \u2192 A0 Z 0 + X via Drell-Yang\nsubprocess, the dotted-lines are for the process pp \u2192 A0 Z 0 + X via both Drell-Yang and gluon\nfusion subprocesses. With the comparison between the \u03c3 (T ) (or d\u03c3 (T ) /dpT ) and \u03c3 (DY ) (or\nd\u03c3 (DY ) /dpT ), we can know in which parameter space in the constrained MSSM, the contribution\nfrom the loop mediated subprocess gg \u2192 A0 Z 0 is important.\nFig.7 displays the cross sections of pp \u2192 bb\u0304 \u2192 A0 Z 0 +X and pp \u2192 A0 Z 0 +X at proton-proton\ncolliders versus the mass of A0 with\n\n\u221a\n\ns = 14 TeV. We choose tan \u03b2=2, 7 and 32, respectively.\n\nFrom Fig.7, we find that in the region of tan \u03b2 \u2264 7, the contribution of gluon-gluon fusion\nsubprocess in the MSSM enhances the cross section, especially when tan \u03b2 = 2 the contribution\nof the gluon-gluon fusion subprocess is about 80% of the total cross section \u03c3 (T ) . In fact, the\ngluon-gluon fusion subprocess is the most important A0 Z 0 associated production mechanism in\nthis parameter space. From the figure we see also that when tan \u03b2=32 the difference between\n\u03c3 (DY ) and \u03c3 (T ) is very small, it means that the contribution of the gluon-gluon fusion subprocess\nis negligible in this parameter space.\n\n12\n\n\fThe cross sections of pp \u2192 bb\u0304 \u2192 A0 Z 0 + X and pp \u2192 A0 Z 0 + X at the LHC as the functions\nof tan \u03b2 with\n\n\u221a\n\ns = 14 T eV are shown in Fig.8. The mass of Higgs boson A0 is taken as 200\n\nGeV, 400 GeV and 600 GeV, respectively. From this figure we can find also that gluon-gluon\nfusion subprocess enhances the cross section of the A0 Z 0 associated production at the LHC,\nand will become a very important production mechanism when tan \u03b2 < 10. In the region of\ntan \u03b2 > 10, the cross section of the A0 Z 0 associated production at the LHC are in the range of\n1 \u2212 102 fb. Even the \u03c3 (T ) can reach 300 fb when tan \u03b2 = 48 and mA = 200 GeV. So the A0 Z 0\nassociated production process may be easily observed experimentally if tan \u03b2 is large enough.\nFig.9 displays the differential cross sections (d\u03c3/dpT ) of pp \u2192 A0 Z 0 + X and pp \u2192 bb\u0304 \u2192\nA0 Z 0 + X at the LHC as the functions of the transverse momentum pT with the pseudorapidity being in the range of |\u03b7| < 2. We choose mA = 350 GeV, and take tan \u03b2=2, 7 and 32,\nrespectively. From this figure we can see that at high pT region, when tan \u03b2 \u2264 7, the difference\nbetween d\u03c3 (DY ) /dpT and d\u03c3 (T ) /dpT is obvious, even when tan \u03b2=2, the d\u03c3 (DY ) /dpT can be less\nthan 1% of d\u03c3 (T ) /dpT , which means that the contribution from the pp \u2192 gg \u2192 A0 Z 0 + X\nprocess is dominant in this parameter space. But when tan \u03b2 = 32, the contribution to the total\ndifferential cross sections (d\u03c3 (T ) /dpT ) is mainly from the Drell-Yan A0 Z 0 associated production\nsubprocess, and the contribution from gluon fusion subprocess is negligible.\n\nIV\n\nSummary\n\nIn this paper, we studied the neutral CP-odd Higgs boson A0 production with the association\nof Z 0 gauge boson via both Drell-Yan and gluon-gluon fusion subprocesses in the constrained\n\n13\n\n\fMSSM at the CERN LHC. Numerical analysis of their production rates is carried out with\nsome typical parameter sets in the mSUGRA scenario. Our results show that the cross section\nin the MSSM is clearly enhanced by the gluon-gluon fusion subprocess in the parameter space\nwith small or moderate tan \u03b2 value, and we should consider the gluon-gluon fusion subprocess\nin this parameter space in the calculation of the A0 Z 0 associated production at the LHC. We\ncompared above results of the process pp \u2192 gg \u2192 A0 Z 0 + X in the MSSM with those in the\ngeneral two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM), where the cross section of subprocess gg \u2192 A0 Z 0 +X\nis contributed only by quark loop diagrams. We find that the contributions from the scalar quark\nloops in the MSSM can either enhance or suppress the cross section obviously and cannot be\nneglected in some parameter space. The results show also that the A0 Z 0 associated production\nat the LHC is strongly related to the parameters tan \u03b2 and the mass of A0 . The total cross\nsection increases with increment of tan \u03b2, and decreases with increment of mA .\n\nAcknowledgments: This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and a grant from the Education Ministry of China .\n\nReferences\n[1] S.
