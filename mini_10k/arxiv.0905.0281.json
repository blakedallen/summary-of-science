Pemmaraju, I. Rungger and S. Sanvito\n\narXiv:0905.0281v1 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci] 3 May 2009\n\nSchool of Physics and CRANN, Trinity College, Dublin 2, Ireland\n(Dated: April 2, 2019)\nWe demonstrate that the different magnetic states of a Mn12 molecule can be distinguished in a\ntwo-probe transport experiment from a complete knowledge of the current-voltage curve. Our results, obtained with state-of-the-art non-equilibrium transport methods combined with density functional theory, demonstrate that spin configuration-specific negative differential resistances (NDRs)\nappear in the I-V curves. These originate from the interplay between electron localization and the\nre-hybridization of the molecular levels in an external electric field and allow the detection of the\nmolecule's spin-state.\nPACS numbers:\n\nThe possibility of addressing and manipulating single\nspins represents the ultimate limit for the magnetic data\nstorage industry. It may also lead to a technological platform for the integration of logic and data storage functionalities on the same device. A crucial aspect of any\nsingle spin-device is the development of a protocol for\nthe electrical readout of the magnetic state of the device.\nHere we explore the possibility of inferring the spin configuration of a magnetic molecule by a detailed knowledge\nof the I-V characteristic of a two-probe device having the\nmolecule as resistive element.\nIn particular we consider the case of Mn12 sandwiched\nbetween non-magnetic electrodes and we compare the\nelectrical response of two possible spin configurations of\nthe molecule. First we look at the ground state (GS),\nwhere the spins of the eight peripheral Mn3+ ions align\nantiparallel to those of the inner Mn4+ to give an overall S = 10 spin state [1]. The second is a spin-flip (SF)\nconfiguration, in which the spin directions of one Mn3+\nand one Mn4+ are reversed with respect to those in the\nGS. The total spin-projection for such a state is S = 9.\nThe most notable difference between the I-V curves obtained for the different spin states is the much higher lowbias current of the GS configuration and the presence of\nNDRs, which are specific to the spin state. These are a\nconsequence of orbital re-hybridization under bias, which\ncauses a highly non-linear bias-dependent coupling of the\nmolecular levels to the electrodes. We predict that this is\na general feature of molecular junctions characterized by\nclosely spaced orbital multiplets, such as those appearing in magnetic molecules. Importantly, since both the\norbital symmetry and their localization depend on the\nmolecule's spin-state, we expect different I-V fingerprints\nfor different magnetic configurations. This means that\nthe overall molecular magnetic configuration is readable\nentirely from a single non-spin-polarized current readout.\nTwo experiments have recently measured the I-V\ncurve of three-terminal devices using Mn12 as the resistive element [2, 3], in both cases revealing features associated to the magnetic state of the molecule. NDRs have\nbeen ascribed to selection-rule forbidden transitions between different charging states [4, 5], with the theory\nbeing based on model Hamiltonians and parameters ex-\n\ntracted from Mn12 single crystal properties. A direct\nquantitative analysis of the results is complicated by the\nlarge variation in I-V s from device to device and by the\nlow device production yield. This stems from the general fragility of Mn12 in single molecule form on surfaces\nagainst fragmentation [6] and redox [7]. The spectroscopical detection of Mn2+ in a Mn12 monolayer [6, 7] is\nproof of such fragility. Furthermore, when the molecule\nremains intact without changing its oxidation state, still\nthe magnetic response is rather sensitive to the surface\nenvironment and different from that of a single crystal.\nMost notably the anisotropy disappears [8], making the\ninterpretation of the transport features in terms of selection rule-forbidden transitions more complicated. Nevertheless, these pioneering transport measurements provide\nan indirect evidence for the different spin states of the\nmolecule. Interestingly such evidence is obtained without\nusing spin-polarized currents as in spin-polarized scanning tunnel microscopy (STM) [9, 10] and so may represent an intriguing alternative for single-spin detection.\nWe begin our analysis by presenting the electronic structure of the archetypal Mn12 acetate cluster\n[Mn12 O12 (CH3 COO)16 (H2 O)4 ] both in the GS and in\nthe SF configuration. The calculations are performed\nwith density functional theory (DFT) using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [11] as numerically\nimplemented in the pseudo-potential, local orbital basis\nset, siesta code [3]. Details of the numerical method\nare presented as supplementary material. The density\nof states (DOS) and the associated local DOS for a few\nof the molecular orbitals around the Fermi energy (EF )\nare presented in figure 6. Clearly the DOS is entirely\ndominated by the Mn3+ d shells (see also supplementary\nmaterials), with an energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of about 0.3 eV. This\nis considerably smaller than the estimated experimental\ngap (1.4 eV [13]) as expected from the self-interaction\ncontributions [14] to the GGA functional. However such\na reduced gap has little qualitative relevance for the lowbias I-V , since the nature of the HOMO manifold is insensitive to the choice of the functional [13].\nIn the GS the DOS is entirely spin-polarized around\n\n\f2\nEF with a triply degenerate HOMO followed by a singly\ndegenerate HOMO-1. Such a degeneracy is lifted in\nthe SF configuration where the HOMO is formed by\nfour closely spaced Mn3+ levels, one of which has the\nopposite spin. Overall the total DOS (not considering\nthe spin polarization) is rather similar in the two cases,\nsuggesting that an electrical measurement, which is not\nsensitive to the spin direction, will hardly be able to\ndistinguish between them. However there is an important difference between the two configurations. This is\nthe degree of localization of the various HOMO levels.\nIn the GS the local DOS shows amplitude uniformly\ndistributed around all the eight Mn3+ ions, while in\nthe SF state the minority HOMO is extremely localized\naround the flipped Mn3+ ion. This has a profound\ninfluence over the electrical response of the molecule.\n\nGS1\n\nSF1\n\nfew HOMOs and LUMOs around EF are not affected by\nthe presence of the ligands or by the passivation. Since a\nfull relaxation of the entire unit cell from DFT is numerically too demanding we first optimize the geometry of\nthe molecule plus ligands and then we calculate the equilibrium bonding distance between the ligands and the\nhollow site of the Au (111) surfaces. The resulting cell is\npresented in the inset of figure 7 (see also supplementary\nmaterial).\nTransport calculations are performed with the\nSmeagol code [1, 2], which combines the nonequilibrium Green's function method (NEGF) [17, 18],\nwith DFT as implemented in Siesta [3]. In this case the\nrather large size of the simulation cell requires a number\nof technical solutions to boost the convergence. We have\nused our recently developed singularity removal procedure to evaluate accurately the leads self-energies [19],\nand implemented a mesh refinement scheme for integrating efficiently the non-equilibrium charge density over energy (see supplementary material). The entire package\nwas parallelized and optimized to run on a large scale\ncomputational facility.\nThe calculated I-V curves, their spin decomposition\nand the associated differential conductances, G(V ), are\npresented in figure 7 for Mn12 both in the GS and the\nSF configuration. The most notable feature is the rather\n\nSF2\n\nFIG. 1: Density of states around the Fermi level (purple vertical line) for [Mn12 O12 (CH3 COO)16 (H2 O)4 ] in the ground\nstate (a) and the spin-flip state (b). MnFlip indicates the\nMn3+ ion whose spin direction was flipped when constructing\nthe SF state. The lower panels display charge density isosurfaces (local density of states) respectively for the GS HOMO\n(GS1), and for both the HOMO (SF1) and the HOMO-4\n(SF2) of the SF configuration. Note that SF2 has opposite\nspin direction with respect to the remaining HOMOs around\nEF . Color code: Blue=Mn, Red=O, Green=C, light blue=H.\n\nWe construct a Mn12 -based two terminal molecular device by sandwiching Mn12 in between two Au (111) surfaces. The molecule is anchored to Au by a thiol group\nattached to the C6 H4 ligand, as in one of the published\ntransport experiments [2]. In order to limit the lateral\ndimensions of the unit cell for the transport calculations,\nwe remove 12 of the possible 16 ligands and passivate the\nremaining bonds. The final simulation cell contains 620\natoms of which 480 are Au atoms of the electrodes, with\nthe basis set expanding over 2672 local orbitals for each\nspin direction. We have carefully checked that the first\n\nFIG. 2: Transport properties of a Mn12 two-probe device.\nThe I-V curves for both the GS and the SF configuration\nare presented in (a), while (b) and (c) show the I-V spindecomposition and the differential conductance respectively.\nThe inset in panel (a) illustrates the simulation cell.\n\nstark difference between the GS and SF curves, which\ndemonstrates that a single current readout enables one\nto distinguish between the different spin states. Importantly this does not require the readout of the two spincomponents of the current, i.e. a spin-polarized measurement, but it is simply obtained by comparing the general\nshape of the I-V characteristics.\nIn particular the distinctive fingerprint of the two mag-\n\n\f3\nnetic configurations is in the presence of NDRs at different bias positions for the two configurations. These originate from the dynamics of the molecular energy levels\nunder bias [20], their charging and their electrical polarization. The main concept is that the different spin\nstates of the molecule are associated to single particle\nlevels with different orbital symmetry and hence with different response to an external electrical potential. Thus\na particular spin configuration translates into a distinct\norbital configuration, which in turn is electrically readable. The details of how the various molecular orbitals\nrespond to the external potential are then determined by\ntheir coupling to the electrodes and their charging energy.\nThese are investigated in figure 8, where we present the\ntransmission coefficient as a function of energy, T (E), calculated at different voltages for both the GS and the SF\nconfiguration. In order to understand our results let us\nrecall the main features of electron transport through a\ngeneric molecular orbital \u03c8\u03b1 . When \u03c8\u03b1 is weakly coupled\nto the electrodes the associated DOS, D\u03b1 (E), is approximated [21] by\nD\u03b1 (E) =\n\n1\n\u03b3\u03b1\n,\n2\u03c0 (E \u2212 \u03b5\u03b1 )2 + (\u03b3\u03b1 /2)2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b3\u03b1 = \u03b3\u03b1L + \u03b3\u03b1R and \u03b3\u03b1L /~ (\u03b3\u03b1R /~) is the transmission rate for electron hopping from the left- (right-) hand\nside electrode to \u03c8\u03b1 . The single particle energy \u03b5\u03b1 depends on the charging state of the molecule. In mean\nfield approximation \u03b5\u03b1 scales linearly [4] with the orbital\noccupation, n\u03b1 , which in turn is determined by\nZ +\u221e\n\u03b3 L f L (E) + \u03b3\u03b1R f R (E)\nn\u03b1 =\ndE D\u03b1 (E) \u03b1\n. (2)\n\u03b3\u03b1\n\u2212\u221e\nHere f L (f R ) is the Fermi function evaluated at E \u2212 \u03bcL\n(E \u2212 \u03bcR ) with \u03bcL (\u03bcR ) the chemical potential of the left(right-) hand side electrode (\u03bcL \u2212 \u03bcR = eV ). Finally the\ntransmission coefficient is T\u03b1 (E) = 2\u03c0\u03b3\u03b1L \u03b3\u03b1R D\u03b1 (E)/\u03b3\u03b1 .\nThe expression (7) establishes that the steady state\ncurrent is a balance of electron fluxes to and from both\nthe electrodes. Thus if a molecular level is more strongly\ncoupled to one of the electrodes, as in an STM geometry, its single particle energy will be pinned to the chemical potential of that electrode, and the corresponding\ntransmission peak T (\u03b5\u03b1 ) will move in energy as a function of bias accordingly. In contrast, when \u03b3\u03b1L \u2248 \u03b3\u03b1R ,\nthen T\u03b1 (\u03b5\u03b1 ) as a function of V is only determined by the\nlevel charging energy. Crucially in both the situations\nthe level broadening \u03b3\u03b1 does not depend on bias and the\nwidth of the transmission peak does not change with V .\nAs a consequence I(V ) is solely determined by the position of the transmission peaks. Since upon increasing the\nbias charging alone cannot expel from the bias window a\nmolecular level which is already inside at a lower bias, no\nNDRs are expected. This is the most typical situation in\nmolecular junctions.\nIn contrast the picture presented in figure 8 is rather\ndifferent. Let us take the GS as an example. At V = 0\n\nthe first four HOMOs are less then 50 meV from EF\nand approximately 300 meV away from the first of the\nLUMO, hence they determine the low bias current. At\npositive bias the current is initially determined by the\nfirst HOMO, which is pinned at EF . The HOMO moves\ninto the bias window at about 100 mV and then roughly\nmaintains its energy position at any larger positive V .\nNotably for V < 100 mV the height of T (\u03b5HOMO ) is near\nto 1, suggesting that such a state is equally coupled to\nthe electrodes. However when the level enters the bias\nwindow T (\u03b5HOMO ) reduces dramatically (note that the\nscale of Fig. 8 is logarithmic), indicating that now the\ncoupling to the electrodes has changed. In general the\nmagnitude of T (\u03b5\u03b1 ) reduces if \u03b3\u03b1L 6= \u03b3\u03b1R . We then conclude that for the HOMO the coupling to the electrodes\nbecomes asymmetric with bias.\nWe can extract a quantitative parameter describing the\ndynamic coupling between the electrodes and the molecular orbitals as a function of bias from the spectral representation of the non-equlibrium Green's function. For\neach molecular level \u03c8\u03b1 , one can evaluate the contributions to the imaginary part of the self-energy originating respectively from the electronic coupling to the left\n(\u03b3\u03b1L ) and right (\u03b3\u03b1L ) electrode. In addition to the total\nbroadening \u03b3\u03b1 we now can define the coupling asymmetry parameter r\u03b1 = (\u03b3\u03b1L \u2212 \u03b3\u03b1R )/(\u03b3\u03b1L + \u03b3\u03b1R ). This is +1\n(-1) for molecular orbitals more strongly coupled to the\nleft (right) contact and 0 for coupling equally strong to\nboth the electrodes.\nIn figures 4 and 5 we trace \u03b5\u03b1 from the position of\nthe various peaks in the transmission coefficients as a\nfunction of V . The colors encode the value of r\u03b1 (in\nFig. 4) and \u03b3\u03b1 (in Fig. 5), and the two straight black\nlines mark the bias window. Let us start again from the\nGS [panels (a)]. As mentioned before for small V the\nfirst HOMO is pinned to the lower bound of the bias\nwindow and, confirming our initial guess, it is roughly\nequally coupled to the electrodes [Fig. 4(a)]. However for\nV \u223c 100 mV it suddenly jumps into the bias window. In\ndoing so a remarkable effect takes place: its coupling to\nthe leads becomes extremely asymmetric, r\u03b1 \u223c 1, while\n\u03b3\u03b1 remains approximately constant. Considering the fact\nthat the contribution to the current from a transmission\npeak, I\u03b1 , is approximately\nI\u03b1 = 2\u03c0\n\ne \u03b3\u03b1 (1 \u2212 r\u03b12 )\n,\nh\n4\n\n(3)\n\nwe conclude that as soon as the peak enters the bias\nwindow the total current actually decreases. This creates\nthe NDR at 100 mV shown in figure 7(c). Similarly the\nsecond HOMO enters the bias window at 200 mV, again\nwith a drastic change of r\u03b1 . This produces the second\nNDR at 200 mV.\nFor V < 0 the situation is analogous although quantitatively different. Again at low bias the HOMO follows\nthe lower boundary of the bias window with an almost\nequal coupling to the two electrodes. Then at about\n\u2212200 mV it suddenly enters the bias window together\n\n\f4\nwith the HOMO-2. Similarly to the V > 0 case entering\ninto the bias window is accompanied by a drastic change\nin coupling. This time however r\u03b1 \u223c \u22121, indicating that\nthe molecular level is now more strongly coupled to the\nright-hand side electrode. As a result the NDRs at negative V appears only at \u2212200 mV.\nWe now turn our attention to the SF configuration.\nThe most notable feature is represented by the minority HOMO, for which the coupling to the leads is almost\ninsensitive to the bias and it is rather equally strong to\nboth the electrodes [see Fig.4(c) and Fig 5(c)]. Therefore\nthe level always follows the lower boundary of the bias\nwindow and remains occupied at any voltage, thus resulting in an almost linear contribution to the I-V . The\nmajority component of the current instead displays a behaviour qualitatively similar to that of the GS. This time\nhowever the first two HOMOs enter the bias window together but only at negative voltages (around \u2212100 mV),\nagain in correspondence to an increased asymmetry of\nthe electronic coupling with the electrodes [r\u03b1 \u223c \u22121, see\nFig. 4(b)]. This generates the NDR at \u2212100 mV.\nFinally we answer the following question: what is the\nmechanism behind the bias-dependence of r\u03b1 ? Let us\nconsider the isosurfaces of Fig. 8, displaying the electronic wave function of a given molecular level in presence of V . For example let us look at the panels 2, 4\nand 6 for the GS. These represent the wave-function of\nthe first HOMO respectively at 300 mV, 0 and \u2212300 mV.\nClearly as bias is applied, the wave function experiences a\nsubstantial polarization, with the electron clouds changing from a uniform distribution at V = 0 to one which is\nconsiderably localized either to the left- or to the righthand side of the junction. The molecular orbital distortion under bias originates from molecular orbital rehybridization and always involves a number of molecular\nstates. For instance, when the HOMO and HOMO-1\nenter the bias window at V > 0 the re-hybirdization in-\n\nvolves the first several HOMOs, as one can deduce from\nthe fact that for most of them there is a change in r\u03b1 [see\nFig. 4(a)]. Importantly for the SF configuration there is\nonly one minority spin level around EF , this cannot hybridize with any other state (unless a spin-flip event occurs), and therefore its coupling to the electrodes changes\nlittle with bias. This fundamental aspect is what creates\nprofoundly different I-V curves in the two cases.\n\n[1] D. Gatteschi, R. Sessoli and J.

This allows them to enter the bias window and to conduct without charging the molecule, which remains neutral at any\nbias investigated. We therefore conclude that the observed NDRs are features in the I-V occurring at energies\nlower than the typical charging energy of the molecule.\nNote that in general orbital re-hybridization may not\nonly lead to NDRs, but also to a sharp increase of G(V ).\nImportantly these are always low-energy satellite features\nto the main Coulomb blockade signal.\nIn conclusion we have demonstrated that the I-V characteristics of Mn12 -based devices are sensitive to the internal magnetic state of the molecule, so that an electrical\nreadout can distinguish between two different magnetic\nconfigurations without the need of resolving the two spin\ncomponents of the current. Such a sensitivity originates\nfrom the bias dependence of the electronic coupling between the molecular levels and the electrodes. In the\ncase examined here this provides a novel mechanism for\nNDRs, which indeed are the final fingerprints of a specific magnetic state of the molecule. Significantly this\nrepresents also a new mechanism for NDR, requiring a\nnumber of closely spaced molecular levels close to the\nelectrodes' Fermi level. Single molecules magnet, with\ntheir d-electron manifold, appear as the ideal material\nsystem for such an effect.\n\n\f5\n[2] A.R. Rocha, V.M. Garcia Suarez, S.W. Bailey, C.J. Lambert, J.

Then peaks in the GF are detected and a denser energy\nmesh is generated around them. The next approximation is\nthen calculated over this new grid after the artificial broadening has been decreased. Such a procedure is repeated until no artificial broadening is left.

Note that the HOMO-LUMO\ngap is an intra-d gap with states originating mainly from Mn\nions (mainly 3+, see main text). Note also the strong Mn-O\nhybridization both in the HOMO and LUMO.\nCalculations have been all performed with the DFT and\nNEGF smeagol code [1, 2]. We use standard scalar relativistic pseudopotentials with the following reference configurations: H 1s1 , C 2s2 2p2 , S 3s2 3p4 , O 2s2 2p4 , Mn 4s2 3d5\nand Au 6s1 . The atomic basis set is constructed as follows\nC: DZ-s, DZ-p; H: DZP-s; O: DZ-s, DZP-p, SZ-d; S: DZ-s,\nDZP-p, SZ-d; Mn: DZP-s, SZP-p, DZ-d; Au: DZ-s (the notation is SZ=single zeta, DZ=double zeta, P=polarized)[3].\nThe real space grid has an equivalent cutoff energy of 400 Ry.\nThe charge density is obtained by splitting the integral of the\nGreen's function (GF) into a contribution calculated over the\ncomplex energy plane and one along the real axis [1]. The\ncomplex integral is performed over a uniform mesh of 512\nimaginary energies, while for the real part we have implemented a new mesh refinement algorithm, necessary to integrate the extremely sharp features of the DOS. Such an\nalgorithm consists in evaluating the integral over an initial\ncoarse energy mesh after the GF has been artificially broad-\n\nFIG. 7: Orbital resolved density of states around the Fermi\nlevel (purple vertical line) for [Mn12 O12 (CH3 COO)16 (H2 O)4 ]\nin the S = 10 ground state.

We note that the HOMO-LUMO\ngap is an intra-d gap formed mainly between molecular orbitals with amplitude over the Mn ions. These have a large\ndegree of hybridization with O and they are fully polarized\naround the Fermi level (EF ). Also note that there is little\ncontribution to the DOS around EF from the C p orbitals.\nIn figure 7 we further analyze the DOS by projecting it\nover the Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions individually. The figure demonstrate that the HOMO-LUMO gap is indeed solely determined\nby Mn3+ d-shell with the first of the Mn4+ states being at\nleast 1 eV away from EF .\n\nIII.\n\nTRANSPORT SIMULATION CELL\n\n[1] A.R.

Color\ncode: Blue=Mn, Red=O, Green=C, Light Blue=H, Yellow=Au, Dark Yellow=S, Purple=Mn (flipped).\n\nThe transport simulation cell is constructed from a\n[Mn12 O12 (CH3 COO)16 (H2 O)4 ] molecule comprising 16 thiolterminated C6 H4 ligands. We cut and passivate 12 of those\n16 ligands in order to reduce the lateral size of the cell. Such\nfinal molecule is relaxed in vacuum by standard conjugate\ngradient method and then positioned at a minimal energy location on the Au (111) surface. The search for the minimum\nis conducted as follows. First we place the S atom of one of\nthe remaining 4 ligands at the hollow site of the Au (111)\nsurface [this is one of the preferential bonding sides for thiol\non Au (111) [4]], and then we rotate the molecule about this\nposition in the search of the total energy minimum. The final device simulation cell (see figure Fig. 7) also includes five\nAu atomic planes on each side of the molecule. The lateral\ndimensions of these are those of a 6 \u00d7 4 supercell constructed\nfrom the primitive cell along the f cc (111) direction. The unit\ncell for the electrodes is also a 6 \u00d7 4 supercell. The resulting\nscattering region (where the self-consistent calculation takes\nplace) is presented in figure 7.
