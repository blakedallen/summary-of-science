We have classified the galaxies along the lines\nof sight into field and structure galaxies using a gap technique (Katgert et al. 1996). In\ntotal we have observed 18 significant structures along the 10 lines of sight.\nSubject headings: galaxies: clusters: general - cosmology: observations - cosmology:\nlarge scale structure of universe\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nOne of the main goals of the study of distant rich clusters of galaxies is to understand their\norigin and evolution. Clusters are invaluable cosmological probes, since the evolution of cluster\nabundances is strongly dependent on the underlying cosmology and therefore can constrain cosmological models (e.g. Bahcall et al. 1997, Oukbir & Blanchard 1992 and 1997, Reichart et al 1999,\nNichol et al. 1999). In order to be able to exploit this potential, large statistically representative\nspectroscopic samples are, however, required.\nThere are two types of samples that are being developed: those based on optical selection\ncriteria and those based on X-ray detections. Below z of about 0.1, optically selected studies (e.g.\nENACS: Katgert et al. 1996) have had about as many clusters in them as those selected via their\nX-ray fluxes. Up until recently, however, the higher redshift work has been dominated by X-ray\nselection techniques (e.g. CNOC: Carlberg et al. 1996 SHARC: Romer et al. 2000; RDCS: Rosati\net al. 1998; WARPS: Jones et al. 1998; Vikhlinin et al. 1998). To greatly enlarge the sample of\ndetailed studies of redshift about 0.4 optically selected clusters, we have embarked on a photometric\nand redshift campaign based on the Palomar Distant Cluster survey (Postman et al. 1996, see also\nHolden et al. 1999). We have observed a significant number of regions on the sky (10) and obtained\nabout 70 redshifts per line of sight. These pointings were known to contain candidate clusters of\ngalaxies based on the PDCS studies (e.g. Postman et al. 1996, Holden et al. 1997).\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nThe main purpose of this paper is to publish the COP survey data and to describe the data\nreduction so as to lay a foundation for future papers. The interpretation of the results is, therefore,\ngiven in later papers (e.g. Holden et al. 2000). The outline of this paper is as follows. In Section 2,\nwe give the observational strategy. In Section 3, we describe the way we have reduced and analyzed\nour photometry. In Section 4, we describe the way we have reduced and analyzed our spectroscopy.\nIn the last section, we give an analysis of the redshift and spatial distribution of the galaxies in our\nsample. The data are given in tables 6-15.\n\n2.\n\nTarget Selection and Observations\n2.1.\n\nObserving strategy\n\nOur project required the measurement of a large number of redshifts (\u223c 100) of faint galaxies\n(VP DCS \u226423) for a significant number of clusters (\u223c 10). It was necessary, therefore, to optimize\nour spectroscopic observations to get as many useful spectra as possible per night. We had photometric data in our fields (the PDCS catalog: Postman et al. 1996) prior to our CFH observations\nwhich considerably reduced the number of nights necessary to produce the spectroscopic catalogue\n(compared for example to the time needed to achieve the CNOC survey, Yee et al. 1996).\nThe first goal of the survey was to study the reality of the selected cluster candidates: are these\nreal physical systems or are these only galaxy number count enhancements due to superposition\neffects (see Holden et al. 2000)? This placed a requirement on the number of redshifts we needed\nalong the line of sight (Katgert et al. 1996). Moreover, we wanted to compute a global velocity\ndispersion for each cluster. This required \u223c10 redshifts in the main groups (the clusters) to allow\nus to use robust estimators (see e.g. Adami et al. 1998c).\nAssuming a line-of-sight contamination between 50 and 75% for a cluster at z\u223c0.4 (see e.g.\nCarlberg et al. 1996) and a success rate of 70% (see Adami et al. 1998b) for our magnitude ranges,\nwe needed to obtain between 50 and 60 spectra for each line of sight in the ideal situation of 1\ncluster per line of sight. Since there could be 2 structures (or more) per pointing, however, we set\na goal of measuring 100 spectra for each pointing (to yield about 70 redshifts).\nIn order to have a statistically representative set of more than 10 lines of sight with more than\n70 redshifts, we have used the CFH-MOS multi-slits spectrograph for its high multiplex gain.\nWe wanted to measure the radial velocity of our targets with an uncertainty of less than 150\nkm s\u22121 because this precision is almost the same as the one obtained for ENACS and CNOC\ngalaxies (e.g. Katgert et al 1996, Mazure et al 1996, Yee et al. 1996). This allows an accurate\ncomparison with these two surveys. Following Adami et al. (1998b) and Yee et al. (1996), we have\nused the CFH O300 grism, which provides a dispersion of about 5 \u00c5.px\u22121 with the STIS2 CFH\nCCD (pixels of 0.43\"). The precision in the velocity measurement depends of both the resolution\ngiven by the grism and slit width (theoretical limiting factor) and the observational conditions\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n(observational limiting factor). The resolution of the O300 grism allowed us to reach the required\nvelocity accuracy.\nWe observed extended objects that were a few arcsecs in diameter. In order to properly\nsubtract the sky in our spectra, we used slitlet lengths of 11 arcsecs. This setup allowed us to place\nabout 40 slitlets per mask for the full spectral range of about 6500 \u00c5 delivered by the grism to be\nused. The setup would require about 3 masks per pointing to reach our goal of 100, however. In\nthis case, the amount of time needed to observe 10 line of sights would have been prohibitive. To\nreduce the amount of time required and increase the multiplexing capabilities of the instrument\nto place \u223c70 slitlets on each mask, we used CFH blocking filters (see Table 1 and see also the\nCNOC survey: Yee et al. 1996). This was effective, since we had estimates of the cluster redshifts\n(Postman et al. 1996), which have been confirmed to be accurate (see Holden et al. 1997) enough\nfor our purposes. These estimates allowed us to chose the right CFH filter so as to span a spectral\nrange that included at least 3 lines for each spectrum (typically selected from [OII], H&K, G band,\nH\u03b2, [OIII] and H\u03b1). For each of the two filters used, Table 1 shows the redshift range that gives\ndispersed spectra of galaxies at that redshift that include the [OII], H&K and G band spectral\nfeatures. Table 2 gives the filter used for each line of sight.\n\n2.2.\n\nCluster candidate selection\n\nWe selected cluster candidates to match the CFH telescope capabilities. It was impossible\nwith the telescope time availability to sample structures at redshifts significantly greater than 0.5\n(see Lubin et al. 1998 and references therein for such a study). We decided, therefore, to restrict\nour sample to cluster candidates in the estimated redshift range 0.3 < z < 0.5. We also selected\nclusters so as to be able to complete the sample in only two semesters at the CFHT. Therefore,\ntargets were selected from the PDCS fields at 9 and 13 hours for the Spring semester and from the\nPDCS fields at 16, 0 and 2 hours for the Autumn semester. We selected also the candidate clusters\nwith both a richness class 1 or greater and significant density peaks in the galaxy distribution (see\nFig. 1, 2 and 3) and we used the highest galaxy density areas. These densest areas coincided with\nor were close to the cluster centers given in Lubin et al. (1996) in most cases. PDCS34 was the\nexception. We observed at a position about 5' to the North of the given cluster center, slightly\ndifferent from Lubin et al. (1996), as we found no galaxy concentration at the exact coordinates of\nPDCS34.\nIn order to describe the galaxy distribution on the sky, we have computed the local projected\ngalaxy density and produced isodensity contours for the PDCS galaxies using an adaptative kernel\ntechnique (e.g. Adami et al 1998a and ref. therein) for each line of sight. This technique adapts the\nsize of the map window to the local density of objects. The same technique has been used in Adami\net al (1998a) to study the ENACS clusters. Where the galaxy density is higher, the window used\nto compute the density of objects is reduced to a value consistent with producing a statistically\nsignificant number of galaxies. Where the galaxy density is lower, the window is larger so as to\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nproduce a similarly valid statistic for the density estimate. We have then produced the Figures 1,2\nand 3.\nFinally, among the cluster candidates matching the previous conditions, we selected those ones\nthat were detected in X-rays (Holden et al. 1997, 1999) whenever possible (only 3 of the 10 lines\nof sight).\n\n2.3.\n\nMask design\n\nWe optimized the number of slitlets per mask to increase the efficiency of the survey. It is\npossible to show that for a field with a very high density of targets, the optimal configuration is to\nplace the slitlets in band configurations. With our limiting magnitude and slitlet width, however,\nthis is not the best method to use because the density of targets is not always the same. To take this\ninto account, we have adapted the Minimal Spanning Tree (MST hereafter) method (e.g. Dussert\net al. 1986) in order to find the optimal configuration according to the filter used. We only give a\nbrief description here: for a given set of points, the MST process finds the minimal total length of a\ntree covering this set (without a loop). If we fix the area (thus the length of tree) the MST exactly\nfinds the maximum number of slits that can be put in that area (according to the constraints: size\nof the slits, magnitudes, filter ..etc...). We have checked this method by showing that it gives a band\nconfiguration for a high density of targets. We show in Figures 4 and 5 the typical configuration\ngiven by this method for 2 of the lines of sight: PDCS62 and PDCS67. PDCS62 has a high density\nof targets (3.97 gal arcmin2 ) while PDCS67 has a lower target density (2.20 gal arcmin2 ). The slit\ndistribution for PDCS62 is close to a band configuration.\nPractically, we designed the masks in three steps. First, the primary potential targets were\nselected from the galaxies with a low enough magnitude to provide a reasonable success rate (percentage of observed galaxies with a redshift successfully measured) according to the planned exposure time. This exposure time was chosen to observe galaxies brighter than VP DCS \u223c \u221219 at the\nmean redshift of the survey (z\u223c0.4). This is about 1.5 magnitude fainter than the typical values of\nM\u2217 in nearby clusters (see e.g. Rauzy et al. 1998).\nWe used the MST selection for these galaxies first. Table 2 gives these magnitude ranges with\nthe real success rates. The mean value is 66%, only slightly lower than the expected value. Then,\nthe secondary potential targets were selected from the galaxies in the next 0.5 magnitude bin (in\nprinciple too faint to provide the same S/N, see Table 2 for the VP DCS magnitude range). Finally,\nif some space remained on the mask after selecting these two types of targets, we also assigned\nslitlets to contain other objects, typically in the VP DCS magnitude range [22,23] or selected by\n\"eye\" during the night (tertiary targets).\nWe did not select the galaxies on the basis of their color, in order to avoid selection effects\nalong the line of sight. Also, the second mask for PDCS62 has been partially designed by hand\n(during the night with the image acquired at the CFH telescope) because the PDCS photometric\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\ndata did not cover all the field (only about 50%).\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nThe photometry\nThe PDCS data\n\nWe selected 10 lines of sight (see Table 2 and Fig. 1-3 and 6) for our observations which\ninclude 14 PDCS cluster candidates that are described in Postman et al. (1996). We have used the\noriginal PDCS photometry to select the galaxy targets. The PDCS photometry was carried out\nin the 4-shooter Palomar V and I filters and calibrated in the AB system. We will refer to it as\nVP DCS and IP DCS from now on. Postman et al. (1996) showed how this photometry compared to\nthe Vega-system standard system. Here, we briefly describe the comparison between systems: the\neffective wavelength of the VP DCS filter is \u2243100\u00c5 bluer and about 50% wider than the standard\nJohnson's V . IP DCS has nearly the same width as the Kron-Cousins I filter, but the effective\nwavelength is about 500\u00c5 redder. The zero points of the VP DCS and IP DCS magnitudes are based\non the AB magnitude system of Oke & Gunn (1983). The magnitudes of Vega are VP DCS =+0.03\nand IP DCS =+0.46. The relation between (VP DCS , IP DCS ) and (V,I) are:\nV = VP DCS \u2212 0.02 \u2212 0.056(VP DCS \u2212 IP DCS ) + 0.012(VP DCS \u2212 IP DCS )2\nand\nI = IP DCS \u2212 0.43 + 0.089(VP DCS \u2212 IP DCS )\nThe uncertainty for VP DCS \u2212 IP DCS is almost 0.2 magnitude (Lubin 1996).\nSince we used the PDCS star/galaxy classification to select the galaxies to observe, it is of\ninterest to determine how well this selection performed. Given our observational strategy with\nblocking filters, faint stars remain unidentified because no obvious spectral feature falls within our\nspectral coverage. The same is true for faint galaxies at redshifts outside the optimal range of the\nfilter used and for galaxies only detected at low signal-to-noise. The validity of the star/galaxy\nseparation can only then be tested against other methods for these cases. We have thus compared\nthe PDCS star/galaxy selection against the classification scheme of Sextractor (Bertin & Arnouts\n1996). Figure 7 shows the comparison for the West PDCS62 spectroscopic field using a V image\ntaken at CFH (see below). We have plotted the ANN (Artificial Neural Network) parameter of\nSextractor characterizing the nature of the objects versus the VP DCS magnitude for the PDCS\nobjects classified as galaxies. The objects in Figure 7 are, therefore, only galaxies according to\nthe PDCS classification. The Sextractor ANN parameter spans the range [0,1], being close to 1\nif the object is classified by Sextractor as a star and moving closer to 0 if the object resembles a\ngalaxy. There is a low contamination rate at faint magnitudes: a few number of objects classified\nas galaxies by the PDCS are interpreted as stars if we use Sextractor. We conclude, therefore, that\nwe optimized the selection of our targets as can be seen by the \"ridge line\" near 0 in Figure 7.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nHowever, according to the mask design technique, we targeted sometimes, in the tertiary-targetclass, objects that were classified as stars by the PDCS, but which were later found to be galaxies.\nThese objects represent, however, less than 3% of the sample and are not a significant source of\nerror.\n\n3.2.\n\nThe CFH photometry\n\nBesides the multislit spectroscopy, we have also imaged the fields of study with the CFHT.\nThe field of view of the frames obtained was 10\u2032 \u00d7 10\u2032 . The imaged areas are shown in Fig. 6\n(the photometric fields are slightly larger than the spectroscopic fields of Fig. 6 which cover about\n8\u2032 \u00d7 8\u2032 ). We used the R, V , 2503 and 4611 filters. The 2503 and 4611 filters were the blocking\nfilters used for the spectroscopy (to limit the extent of the spectra) and are described in Table 1.\nThey are, respectively, a very wide V filter and a filter similar to a combination of the V +R filters.\nThe V filter is a standard Johnson filter (centered at 5470\u00c5, and FWHM of 880\u00c5) and the R filter\nis similar to the Kron-Cousins R but somewhat narrower without the red tail. It is centered at\n6500\u00c5, and has a FWHM of 1280\u00c5. From now on we will refer to these filters as VCOP and RCOP .\nAll fields were imaged for 5 minutes, except for PDCS16 and the two first fields of PDCS38 that\nwere exposed for 15 and 8 minutes, respectively (see Table 3). The images have been photometrically\ncalibrated in the Vega system using several Landolt standard fields (Landolt 1992). Given that most\nof the fields were observed in only one filter, the photometric calibrations only include a extinction\nterm and a zero point but not a color term. The uncertainties in our photometry were dominated\nby the fluctuations of the zero points, computed at different airmasses throughout the night, due to\nimperfect photometric conditions. The internal statistical errors within a field are negligible, except\nfor the faintest objects. We estimate the systematic zero-point error in our measured magnitudes\nto be less than 0.15 mag for the observations taken in February 1998 (see Table 3) and less than\n0.10 mag for the August 1998 observations. Table 3 summarizes our observations.\nWe used the VCOP exposure for the second field of PDCS62 to complete the VP DCS data. This\ncluster was not completely covered by the PDCS photometry. To transform our magnitudes into a\nVP DCS , we have computed the relation between VP DCS and our VCOP for the first field of PDCS62\nand applied it to the second field where the VCOP magnitudes were also available. The best fit\nobtained was:\nVP DCS \u2212 VCOP = \u22120.28(VCOP \u2212 block4611 ) + 0.14\nWe plot finally on Fig. 8 the relations between VP DCS and IP DCS , and between VP DCS and\nRCOP for all the galaxies in our sample.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n3.3.\n\nGalactic extinction\n\nThe fields chosen for the PDCS were selected from high-latitude Gun & Oke (1975) survey\nareas. We avoided regions of high extinction. As expected, the galactic extinction values obtained\nfrom the Burstein & Heiles (1982) and Schlegel et al (1998) reddening maps are low. The mean\nextinction in the VP DCS band is 0.027 and lower than this value for the IP DCS filter in all the fields\n(Postman et al 1996). Given the small extinction values and our photometric errors we have chosen\nnot to correct for extinction.\n\n4.\n4.1.\n\nThe CFH spectroscopy\nComputing the redshifts\n\nWe have used both the MIDAS (public ESO reduction package) and IRAF (see e.g. Kurtz &\nMink 1998) packages to reduce the 2-Dimensional spectra to 1-Dimensional spectra. The details\nof the method used can be found in Holden et al. (1999). We computed the redshift from the 1dimensional spectra from emission lines and from cross-correlation techniques (e.g. Tonry & Davis\n1979). If there were more than two emission lines (\"only\"), we computed the emission line redshift\nmeasuring the centroid of the identified lines using gaussian fits and averaging the redshifts. For\nabsorption line dominated spectra, we cross-correlated the spectra with 4 different spectroscopic\ntemplates (M31, M32, a 20 Gyear old E/SO Bruzual & Charlot (1993) model and finally a spectrum\nresulting from the combination of 1959 low-z high quality absorption line spectra: Kurtz & Mink\n1998). We used the IRAF/RVSAO package to compute the redshifts. For absorption line dominated\ngalaxies, we produced 4 estimates of the redshift, one from each template. To select a unique value,\nwe proceeded as follows:\n-1st: eliminated all the redshift estimates lower than -0.015 assuming that even the infalling\ngalaxies of the Virgo cluster have velocities greater than -4500 km s\u22121 . This limit is clearly an\nextreme value.\n-2nd: eliminated all the redshift estimates with a cross-correlation coefficient lower than 3 (see\nKurtz & Mink 1998, Tonry & Davis 1979).\n-3rd: selected as the true redshift the estimate with the best cross-correlation coefficient if\nthere was a gap of more than 1 with the second best coefficient.\n-4th: assumed the mean value of the redshifts with the best cross-correlation coefficients if\nthey were in agreement (difference less than 300 km s\u22121 ).\n-5th: if neither the 3rd nor 4th conditions were fulfilled, we have simply assumed the value of\nthe redshift with the best cross-correlation coefficient.\nUsing this approach, we obtained 636 redshifts (see Table 2 and 4 for details). We present a\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nsub-sample of 4 spectra in Fig 9. The lower left spectrum is typical of our best signal to noise.\nIt represents a galaxy at z=0.462 with a cross-correlation coefficient of 13.26. The lower right\nspectrum is a galaxy where we have used emission lines to deduce the redshift (z=0.658), e.g. the\n[OII] line shown on the figure (at \u223c6180\u00c5). This spectrum is typical of the worse spectra we used,\nbut the cross-correlation method also was able to detect the CaII H&K lines around 6600\u00c5. The\nupper spectra (left and right) are typical of all our sample. The upper left spectrum is a galaxy at\nz=0.461 (cross-correlation coefficient of 4.33) and the upper right spectrum is a galaxy at z=0.459\nwith both absorption line features (cross-correlation coefficient of 3.54) and emission line features\n([OII]).\n\n4.2.\n\nChecking the redshifts\n\nTo check the validity of the assigned redshifts we have \"eye-balled\" all the emission line redshifts\nand also checked a randomly selected sample of absorption line dominated spectra. Our visual\ninspection confirmed the validity of our computationally derived redshifts.\nFor 19 objects, we also had two separate spectra and, hence, two independent measurements\nof the redshift. These objects were observed twice due to overlaps in observing runs done at CFH\nand at the 4 meter Mayall telescope (see Holden et al. 1997). In order to estimate the uncertainties\nof our redshifts, we have then plotted the percentage difference between the two estimates versus\nthe cross-correlation coefficient r (Tonry & Davis 1979). Fig. 10 shows the 18 galaxies with\nless than 2.5% of difference. The mean error for the redshift estimate is 0.7% of the redshift (or\n0.0016 in redshift). The 19th galaxy, although having a cross-correlation coefficient of r=4.2, had a\ndiscrepancy of 42% . This is clearly due to one wrong redshift. This galaxy was observed twice at\nCFHT. The first observation provides a redshift of 0.15364 and a correlation coefficient of 4.2. The\nsecond observation yielded a redshift of 0.08958 and a correlation coefficient of 4.2. However, for\nthis observation, the second best estimate (with another template) of the redshift is 0.15673 with a\ncorrelation coefficient of 3.71, still acceptable. Using the second value of the redshift, the difference\nis only 2% for the initially discrepant galaxy. Assuming that these 19 galaxies are representative of\nour entire sample, we estimate that less than about 5% of our sample has a false redshift assignment.\nThis has a negligible effect on conclusions we draw based on these results.\n\n5.\n5.1.\n\nAnalysis\n\nFinal catalogues\n\nWe identified the objects we measured at CFH (redshift + RCOP magnitude) with the galaxies\nin the PDCS survey in order to build catalogues with position (measured at CFH), redshift, RCOP\nmagnitude and VP DCS and IP DCS magnitude (Tables 6-15). This is also a way to estimate the\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nuncertainty for the coordinates of the galaxies. We found a mean difference between the PDCS\ncoordinates and the coordinates measured at CFH of 3.5\"\u00b12.3\". This is typically the uncertainty\nfor the coordinates we give in table 6-15.\nWe also classified the galaxies in redshift space as members of a structure or as field galaxies.\nThis was a first step. A more detailed classification is discussed in Holden et al. (2000), but we give\nthese results in order to present a complete overview of the data. In order to make this classification,\nwe have searched the velocity distribution of each line of sight for gaps of more than 1000 km s\u22121 . If\nwe had more than 5 galaxies between two successive gaps, we have called these galaxies a structure.\nThis is exactly the same method used to define the structures in the ENACS catalog (Katgert et\nal. 1996). The method does not completely avoid the inclusion of some interloppers, but, to a first\napproximation, it defines the compact structures (gravitationally bound) in redshift space. We\nsummarize the results in Table 4, Table 6 to 15 and in Figures 11 and 12.\n\n5.2.\n\nCompleteness and spatial representativity\n\nWe show in Fig. 13 the variation of the completeness level of the spectroscopic catalogue\ncompared to the photometric catalogue. This completeness level C is defined as the ratio between\nthe number of galaxies with a measured redshift (galaxies targeted and successfully measured) and\nthe total number of galaxies. It is different from the success rate, which is only the ability to deduce\nthe redshift of a target. We see on Fig. 13 that this level is constant around 35% from VP DCS =16.5\nto VP DCS =21.0. This relatively low level is because we did not have time to put a slit on all the\navailable galaxies. The percentages of the 2 brightest bins of Fig. 13 are based on a low number\nof galaxies, since, we targeted more faint galaxies than bright galaxies explicitely to try to keep\nconstant the completeness level C. This constant sampling is important for studying the galaxy\ndistribution along the line of sights because it prevents us from severe redshift selection effects. For\nthe faintest galaxies, the completeness level drops down to 6% for VP DCS =22.5. These percentages\nwere computed using all the lines of sight put together except PDCS61 for which the exposure time\nwas very short. These percentages do not change considerably from pointing to pointing (except\nfor PDCS61). For several types of analysis, it may be useful to give an analytical expression of the\nvariation of the completeness level C. For the magnitudes brighter than VP DCS =20.5, C=35.5%.\nFor the fainter magnitudes, assuming a power law model, the best fit is:\nC = 10\u22120.44(VP DCS \u221224.07) %\nTo test for selection effects in the spatial distribution of the galaxies for which we measured\nredshift, we compared the spatial distribution of our redshift measured sample to that of all the\nPDCS galaxies. For this comparison, we have used a bidimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov test as\na function of the V limiting magnitude to determine the variation of this representativity level as\na function of the photometric depth of the sample. A value of the representativity level given by\nthe Kolmogorov-Smirnov test close to 100% means that the two distributions on the sky are very\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nsimilar: the galaxies with a measured redshift are a statistically representative sub-sample in term\nof spatial distribution. A value lower than 90% means that this sub-sample is statistically different\nat the level of 10%. We see in Tab. 5 that, except for PDCS30-45, the two spatial distributions\nare indistinguishable for the magnitudes brighter than 21. Note that the case of PDCS30-45 is not\neasely explained (see Tab. 5).\n\n6.\n\nSummary\n\nWe have presented and given the data gathered in the COP survey. The spectroscopic and\nphotometric observations were performed with the MOS/STIS2 instrument during 6 nights at the\nCFH telescope with the grism O300 and 2 blocking filters to enhance the multiplex gain of MOS.\nWe have used a method based on the MST theory to optimize the number of slits per mask. This\nallowed us to measure 636 redshifts for 10 PDCS lines of sight. These lines of sight were selected\nto hold PDCS candidate clusters, with significant peaks in the galaxy density distribution.\nThe success rate (percentage of targeted galaxies with a successfully measured redshift) was\nclose to 70% for the primary targets (typically brighter than VP DCS =22.). The completeness\nlevel (percentage of all galaxies with a measured redshift) was about 35% down to VP DCS =20.5.\nThe galaxies with a redshift were proved to be a spatially representative sub-sample down to\nVP DCS =20.5 (no significant spatial selection effects). Finally, the percentage of false redshifts was\nabout 5%, based on 19 galaxies observed twice.\nA comparison of the photometry from the PDCS (Postman et al. 1996) catalogs and from the\nnew images we have obtained at the CFH telescope shows that the different magnitude systems\ncan be cross-calibrated. This confirmation is important for the reliability of future works based on\nthe multi-color photometry of COP. After identification between the PDCS catalogues and our new\nimages, we built catalogues with redshift, coordinates and VP DCS , IP DCS and RCOP magnitude\n(Tab. 6-15).\nWe have classified the galaxies along the lines of sight into field and structure galaxies using a\ngap technique (Katgert et al. 1996). In total we have observed 18 significant structures along the\n10 lines of sight (Tab. 4). As noted in the introduction, the interpretation of the results is given\nelsewhere (e.g. Holden et al. 2000).\nCA thanks the staff of the Dearborn Observatory for their hospitality during his postdoctoral\nfellowship.

Table of the spatial representativity levels of the sample of galaxies with a measured\nredshift compared to the sample of all the PDCS galaxies (as a function of the limiting\nmagnitude). We have used a bidimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov test as a function of the V\nlimiting magnitude. A value close to 100 means that the two distributions (sample with redshift\nversus total sample) have a very similar spatial distribution. A value lower than 90 means that\nthe 2 distributions are spatially differently distributed at the level of 10%. We have tested each of\nthe masks of the PDCS30/45 line of sight to see if the low representativity level of this line of\nsight was due to one peculiar mask. We give also for each representativity level the number of\ngalaxies with a measured redshift (only when we used more than 10 galaxies).\n\nPDCS04\nPDCS16\nPDCS30-45 all\nPDCS30-45 1\nPDCS30-45 2\nPDCS30-45 3\nPDCS30-45 4\nPDCS33\nPDCS34\nPDCS38\nPDCS57\nPDCS61\nPDCS62\nPDCS67\n\n<20.\n\n<20.5\n\n61.0 (17)\n99.9 (15)\n-\n\n99.9 (10)\n58.0 (32)\n76.5 (14)\n99.9 (13)\n99.9 (12)\n99.9 (11)\n99.9 (18)\n99.9 (10)\n69.3 (17)\n99.9 (12)\n\n<21.\n99.9\n99.9\n48.0\n57.7\n46.4\n\n(22)\n(11)\n(49)\n(12)\n(19)\n71.8 (12)\n99.9 (19)\n99.9 (26)\n48.2 (30)\n99.9 (25)\n99.9 (12)\n99.9 (30)\n99.3 (16)\n\n<21.5\n99.9\n99.9\n24.9\n11.5\n22.7\n\n(36)\n(21)\n(57)\n(13)\n(24)\n30.8 (12)\n99.9 (26)\n99.9 (36)\n51.1 (42)\n83.4 (38)\n68.7 (12)\n48.3 (47)\n71.4 (20)\n\n<22.\n\n<22.5\n\n99.9 (49)\n99.9 (34)\n30.4 (72)\n2.8 (17)\n37.6 (27)\n77.0 (12)\n16.9 (16)\n99.9 (36)\n74.4 (44)\n17.8 (46)\n83.1 (57)\n89.5 (17)\n57.5 (62)\n52.9 (32)\n\n99.9 (63)\n65.9 (42)\n14.5 (81)\n2.2 (21)\n36.6 (28)\n86.7 (13)\n3.6 (19)\n68.3 (48)\n99.9 (47)\n36.8 (61)\n84.0 (69)\n75.8 (19)\n48.5 (76)\n69.8 (37)\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\n\nTable 6.
