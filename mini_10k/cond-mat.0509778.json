Taking\nthese two effects into account, we compute the quasiparticle effective mass as a function of applied\nfield strength within hybridization mean field theory. We also derive an expression for the optical\nconductivity, which is relevant to infrared spectroscopy measurements.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nHeavy fermion materials1,2 are metallic alloys of actinide or rare-earth elements (typically U or Ce). At high\ntemperature, their chemically active valence electrons are\nconfined in localized f orbitals. These f -electrons constitute a dense lattice of localized spins embedded in-and\nonly weakly interacting with-the ordinary conduction\nsea. At low temperature, the f -electron moments become strongly coupled to the conduction electrons and,\nindirectly, to each other. Below the characteristic Kondo\ntemperature, a complicated many-body state emerges in\nwhich the local moments are screened (provided that the\nKondo physics overwhelms the competing RKKY interaction3 ). This state exhibits unconventional metallic behaviour with an effective mass tens or hundreds of times\nlarger than that of a bare band electron.\nThe key detail is that the broad band of conduction\nelectrons is intersected by a nearly dispersionless, highly\ncorrelated, f -electron band. The heavy fermion ground\nstate can be understood to be a \"nearly-broken symmetry\" state4 in which the overlap between excitations in\nthe two bands becomes macroscopically important (to order 1/N , where N \u2192 \u221e represents the limit of large orbital degeneracy4,5,6 ). This motivates treating the Kondo\nphysics, in the guise of an interband hybridization, at the\nmean field level.\nWhen the hybridization order parameter condenses,\nthe f -electrons are incorporated into an enlarged Fermi\nsea of composite quasiparticles. Mixing between the local\nand itinerant degrees of freedom causes the conduction\nband to break into upper and lower quasiparticle bands,\nleaving a region of shallow dispersion (i.e., large effective\nmass) near the hybridization gap edge.\nThe hybridization picture has been verified in real materials by a variety of experimental methods. Infrared\n(IR) spectroscopy in particular has proved to be an important experimental probe: IR studies of YbFe4 Sb12\nand CeRu4 Sb12 provided the first direct observation of\nthe hybridization gap in heavy metals.7 In addition, the\ncomplex optical conductivity and the dielectric function,\nobtained from reflectance measurements by KramersKronig, can be used to infer the effective mass. Such an\nanalysis is possible because the electrodynamic response\nof the system depends on the mass enhancement factor\n\nin a known way.8,9,10\nIn a recent experiment, Dordevic et al. carried out a detailed IR study of the heavy fermion material CeRu4 Sb12\nin high magnetic fields.11 A complete theory of the electrodynamic response was lacking in this case. Here, the\napplied field breaks the spin degeneracy of the Fermi sea,\nwith the result that spin up and spin down quasiparticles\nhave different effective masses. The reflectance, however,\nis insensitive to the quasiparticle spin. Thus, the measured optical conductivity, insofar as it depends on the\n(now spin-dependent) mass enhancement factor, represents an average over the two spin projections.\nIn this paper, we compute the mean field heavy fermion\nground state in the presence of a Zeeman field (under the\nassumption that the field does not induce a magnetic instability12,13 ). We find that the effective mass is modified\nto linear order because of Fermi surface splitting and to\nquadratic order because of magnetic suppression of the\nKondo singlet amplitude. As it turns out, the optical\nconductivity averages over the effective mass in such a\nway that corrections first appear at second order and\nwith a negative coefficient; the characteristic field scale\nis on the order of the Kondo energy (in magnetic units).\nSuch behaviour is observed experimentally in Ref. 11.\nThe paper is organized as follows. The hybridization\nmean field equations are derived in Secs. II and III. Their\nsolution in zero and nonzero field is presented in Sec. IV,\nfollowed by a discussion of the optical conductivity in\nSec. V.\nII.\n\nMEAN FIELD FORMALISM\nA.\n\nHybridization Field\n\nThe Kondo Lattice Model (KLM) is thought to provide\nan approximate description of heavy fermion materials.\n(The Periodic Anderson Model in the limit of large onsite\nrepulsion is an equivalent starting point.14 ) It describes\na band of free conduction electrons moving in a periodic\narray of magnetic impurities \u015cr . The only interaction is\nthe onsite Heisenberg exchange between the electron spin\ndensity and the magnetic moment of the impurities.\nX\nX\n\u0124KLM = \u2212\ntr\u2212r\u2032 c\u2020r cr\u2032 + J\n\u015dr * \u015cr .\n(1)\nrr \u2032\n\nr\n\n\f2\nHere, tr = t\u2217\u2212r and J are the hopping and exchange\nintegrals, respectively, and c\u2020 (c) is the creation (annihilation) operator for the conduction electrons; \u015d = 12 c\u2020 \u03c3c\ndescribes their local moment. The impurity spins are\nS = 1/2. The model can be extended to include a Zeeman term, which consists of a magnetic field B coupled\nto the total magnetic moment at each site:\n\u0124 = \u0124KLM \u2212 B *\n\nX\nr\n\n\u0001\n\u015dr + \u015cr .\n\n(2)\n\nA useful formal trick is to represent the local spins\nin terms of fermions, which puts the local and itinerant\ndegrees of freedom on the same footing. Specifically, we\ntake \u015c = 12 f \u2020 \u03c3f subject to the constraint f \u2020f = 1. Here,\nf \u2020 (f ) is the creation (annihilation) operator of a fictitious, dispersionless f band. The constraint suppresses\nall f -charge fluctuations and has the effect of projecting\nout the singlet states that are not a part of the Hilbert\nspace of the original SU(2) spin. We shall assume that\nit is sufficient to enforce the constraint on average and\nrequire only that hf \u2020f i = 1.\nThe operators \u03c7\u0302\u03bc = \u221a12 f \u2020 \u03c3 \u03bc c, defined in terms of the\nunit and Pauli matrices \u03c3 \u03bc = (1, \u03c3), describe the spin\ndegrees of freedom at each site. They can be used to\nexpress the exchange term in the Hamiltonian as\n1 \u2020\n4 c \u03c3c\n\n* f \u2020 \u03c3f = \u2212 43 \u03c7\u03020\u2020 \u03c7\u03020 + 14 \u03c7\u0302\u2020 * \u03c7\u0302.\n\n(3)\n\n\u03c7\u03020 and \u03c7\u0302 act in the singlet and triplet channels, respectively. In the heavy fermion state, the singlet amplitude\ncondenses h\u03c7\u03020 i =\n6 0, leading to hybridization of the c\nand f bands. Neglecting second order fluctuations about\n\u03c7\u03020 = h\u03c7\u03020 i gives\n2\n\n\u03c7\u03020\u2020 \u03c7\u03020 = h\u03c7\u03020 i\u2217 \u03c7\u03020 + \u03c7\u03020\u2020 h\u03c7\u03020 i \u2212 h\u03c7\u03020 i .\n\n(4)\n\nThe resulting mean field Hamiltonian is\n\u0124MF = \u2212\n\nX\nrr \u2032\n\nh\n\u0001i\nc\u2020r tr\u2212r\u2032 + \u03b4rr\u2032 \u03bcc + B * \u03c3/2 cr\u2032\n\n\u2212\n\nX\n\n\u0001\nfr\u2020 \u03bcf + B * \u03c3/2 fr\n\n\u2212\n\nX\n\nr\n\nr\n\n(5)\n\n\u0001\n8 X\n2\nVr\u2217 fr\u2020 cr + Vr c\u2020r fr +\nVr .\n3J r\n\nQuasiparticle Dispersion Relation\n\nThe minimum-energy hybridization field configuration\nis translationally invariant. Thus, we can write Vr = V =\nV ei\u03b8 . Moreover, although the hybridization hf \u2020 ci is in\ngeneral complex, we may safely take V to be real and\npositive. There is a U(1) gauge freedom associated with\nthe invariance of \u015c = 21 f \u2020 \u03c3f under the phase rotation\nf 7\u2192 ei\u03c6 f . Accordingly, by fixing \u03c6 = \u2212\u03b8, we can gauge\naway the phase of V .\nEquation (5) has a particularly simple wavevector representation,\n\u0012 \u0013\nX\n\u0001\n8N V 2\nc\n\u2020\n.\n(7)\nHMF =\nMks ks +\nc\u2020ks fks\nfks\n3J\nks\n\nIn the summation, k ranges over all wavevectors in the\nBrillouin zone and s over the two fermion spin projections.

By writing\n3\nB * \u03c3ss\u2032 = B\u03c3ss\n\u2032 = sB\u03b4ss\u2032 , we have chosen to direct the\napplied magnetic field along the 3 axis.\nIt is convenient to introduce the quantities\n2\u03bc = \u03bcc + \u03bcf\n\nand b = \u03bcc \u2212 \u03bcf ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhich serve as an alternate set of Lagrange multipliers\n(rotated 45 degrees with respect to the original set). As\nwe shall see, \u03bc is the energy required to remove a dressed\nquasiparticle from the top of the Fermi sea, whereas b/2\nis the energy to remove a bare conduction electron. We\ncan think of \u03bc as the chemical potential of the fully interacting system.

It generates a region of very shallow\ndispersion near the gap edge, which is responsible for the\nlarge effective mass of the quasiparticles. For concreteness, let us suppose that the lower band is filled to some\npoint below the hybridization gap. Then the relevant dispersion relation is that of the lower band. This situation\nis depicted in Fig. 2. The heavy fermion state is metallic\nand possesses a well-defined Fermi surface given by the\nset of k points satisfying Ek\u2212 = \u03bc.\nThe effective mass m\u2217 of the quasiparticle excitations\nis a function of the band curvature. It is related to the\n\u2212\nnoninteracting band mass by the variation m\u2217 \u03b4Eks\n=\n\u2217 \u2212\nm \u03b4Ik = m\u03b4\u01ebk , averaged over all points on the Fermi\nsurface. Hence, the mass enhancement factor is given by\n(m\u2217 /m) = (\u2202Ikn /\u2202\u03b5k )\u22121\nF and, via Table I,\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202 \u03c92 \u2212 V 2\nV2\nm\u2217\n=\n=1+ 2\nm s\n\u2202\u03c9\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\nF\n\n.\n\n(26)\n\n\u03c9=\u03bcf s\n\nThe direct energy splitting between the bands can be\n\n\f5\nwritten as\n+\n\u2212\nEks\n\u2212 Eks\n=\n\n1X\n2\n\nn\n\n\u0001\nn Ikn \u2212 Ik\u2212n .\n\n(27)\n\nSince optical experiments probe quasiparticles at the top\nof the Fermi sea by promoting them to the upper band\nwith negligible momentum transfer and without inducing\nspin flips (dk = 0, s fixed), the optical gap is determined\nby evaluating Eq. (27) at the Fermi level. Again, via\nTable I,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0001\n1\nV2\n\u2206opt s = sgn(\u03c9) \u03c9 +\n.\n(28)\n2\n\u03c9\n\u03c9=\u03bcf s\nNote that Eqs.

(The volume enclosed by the enlarged Fermi\nsurface is nc + nf = 2 \u2212 x.) We can think of x as the density of holes in the lower band doping the system away\nfrom the half-filled Kondo insulator state. Further, since\nVan Hove singularities do not play an important role\nhere, let us assume that the density of levels in Eq. (23)\nis flat and replace the line-shape function by its average\nvalue g \u2192 1/W . The total DOS is then\nD(\u03c9) =\n\n\u0012\n\u0013 4\nV2 X\n1\n(\u22121)i+1 \u03b8(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9i ).\n1+ 2\nW\n\u03c9\ni=1\n\n(30)\n\nExpanding Eqs.

In\nthis regime, the Kondo and hybridization energies obey\n\u2206K /W \u223c V 2 /W 2 \u223c \u03b1, where \u03b1 = e\u22124W/3J is a small\nparameter. The range of valid band fillings, corresponding to 0 < x . 1 \u2212 \u03b1, lies between the Kondo-insulator\nand exhaustion limits.\nThe hybridization picture captures the essential features of a heavy metal. It allows us to understand how\nquantities such as the effective mass and magnetic susceptibility are renormalized by a common enhancement\nfactor 1/\u03b1. It also explains the existence of the upper\nquasiparticle band and clarifies the role of the hybridization gap. Most important for our purposes, the mean\nfield theory provides a simple framework within which to\ncompute transport and electrodynamic properties.\nIn this paper, we have extended the usual heavy\nfermion picture to the case of an applied Zeeman field.\nThe spin splitting of the Fermi surface forces us to distinguish between the spin up and spin down quasiparticles. We have shown that their effective masses differ\nto linear order in B/B0 . Further contributions appear\nat second order because of a reduction in the Kondo energy. Accounting for these two effects, we have arrived\nat a specific prediction for the behaviour of the optical\nconductivity.\nOur treatment makes the assumption (\u03bcf s < \u03c92 ) that\nthe applied field is suitably small with respect to the\nKondo energy: |B| < 2\u2206K x(1 \u2212 x). From an experimental point of view, this may still be a large field. The\nKondo energies of typical heavy fermion materials are\nin the range of 40\u2013100 K. Hence, the predictions in this\npaper may be valid for fields as large as 20\u201330 T.\nThe author would like to thank Dimitri Basov and\nSasha Dordevic for many helpful discussions.\n\n10\n11\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n864 (1987).\nL.
