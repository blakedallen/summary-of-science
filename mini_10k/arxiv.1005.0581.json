Our\napproach is to introduce an external, static perturbation to extract the structural information from\nthe system's response.

The\nfinite-size scaling analysis of our numerical results indicate that the correlation length diverges at\na temperature Tc , below the temperatures where the system can be equilibrated.

The physical mechanism of the dramatic slowing down and corresponding increase in viscosity upon approaching the glass\ntransition has been vehemently debated for more than 40\nyears [1, 2]. In critical phenomena, the slowing down of\nthe system's dynamics is intimately related to a nearby\nphase transition, where a diverging length scale typically\nreflects the onset of long-range correlation. Several recent theories of the glass transition are built in this spirit\n[3\u20136] and are supported from results on dielectric susceptibility [7] and specific heat [8, 9]. The few experimental studies, however, show only a moderate cooperativity\nlength near the glass transition of some four to five particle diameters [10]. Specifically designed simulations [11]\nhave recently indicated a growing amorphous order in the\nrange of four particle diameters. The results confirm, to\nsome extent, the predictions of random first order theory\n(RFOT) [3, 6]. However, no evidence for critical behavior with a diverging length scale could be found there. A\ngrowing correlation length is also indicated by a very recent numerical study of different local quantities [12] and\nit is interpreted as the hint of a critical behavior, whose\nevidence, nevertheless, is still very elusive. The heterogeneous dynamics of glass forming liquids allow one to\ndefine a dynamical correlation length [1, 13\u201316] which is\nindeed growing as the glass transition is approached, but\nit remains unclear how, or whether at all, this dynamical length has a static, structural origin as is the case\nin phase transitions. A promising, alternative approach\nto supercooled liquids is based on inherent structures,\ni.e. the local minima of the underlying potential energy\nlandscape [17]. Although several qualitative changes in\nthe system dynamics can be related to changes in their\ninherent structures [18, 19], no length scale as significantly increasing as the dynamical correlation length has\nemerged so far [20].\nFollowing a nonequilibrium thermodynamic theory of\nglasses [21], here we use small, static deformations to perturb the inherent structure configurations of supercooled\n\nliquids approaching the glass transition [22]. With this\nprocedure, large correlated regions emerge at low temperatures and allow us to detect a static correlation length\nthat shows critical behavior upon approaching the glass\ntransition.\nMethods and numerical simulation. \u2013 We employ a\nbinary Lennard-Jones mixture, which is an established\nmodel for fragile glass formers [23] (see Appendix A).\nAn ensemble of well equilibrated configurations are prepared at constant density by slowly cooling statistically\nindependent samples from high temperatures down to\nthe supercooled regime. We study different system sizes\nranging from N = 2000 up to N = 64000 particles. The\ninherent structure X q = {rqj } corresponding to the actual configuration X = {rj } is obtained by locally minimizing the system's potential energy by a conjugate gradient method. The potential energy landscape and its\nlocal minima (the inherent structures) have been studied intensively in recent years, unraveling a number of\nremarkable relations between inherent structure properties and the system's behavior [24\u201328]. Unlike these previous studies, we investigate the relation between two\ninherent structure configurations, X q and X dq , where\nthe latter is the inherent structure corresponding to the\naffinely deformed configuration X d = {rdj }, rdj = E * rj ,\nwhere the deformation is represented by the matrix E.\nFrom these configurations, we define the mismatch vecq\ntors dj \u2261 rdq\nj \u2212 E * rj , which give the nonaffine displacements between two inherent structure configurations. In\nparticular, we consider static shear deformations with\nsmall amplitude \u03b3, E = 1 + \u03b3e1 e2 , where e\u03b1 are Cartesian unit vectors. In Ref. [22], we found, as the temperature is lowered towards the glass transition, characteristic changes which are strongly reminiscent of the\nsystems long time dynamics: small average mismatch\nlengths which are correlated over large distances.\nResults. \u2013 In order to study correlations in the direction of the mismatch field, we define P\nthe coarse-grained\nnonaffine displacement field Db (r) = j Dj (b)\u03b4(r \u2212 rqj )\nof the inherent structure configuration X q , where Dj (b)\n\n\f2\na\n6\n\nb = 1\nb = 1\nb = 2\nb = 3\n\n4\n\nb\n\n.0 0\n.0 6\n.0 0\n.5 0\n\n8\n6\n\n)\n2\n\nh b(D\n\n2\n0\n0 .0\n\nare the coarse-grained mismatch orientations obtained by\naveraging d0j = dj /|dj | over a sphere of radius b [29],\nDj (b) =\n\nNj\u22121\n\nX\n\ndq\nd0k \u03c7b (rjk\n).\n\n(1)\n\nk\ndq\nHere, rjk\nis the distance between particles j and k in the\ninherent structure of deformed configuration X dq , Nj =\nP\ndq\nk \u03c7b (rjk ) the number of neighbors of particles j within\na distance b, and \u03c7b (r) = 1 if r \u2264 b and zero elsewhere.\nFor sufficiently small deformations, the mismatch field\nis approximately independent of strain amplitude \u03b3 in\na statistical sense and the use of normalized mismatch\nvectors d0j suppresses the strong temperature dependence\nof the average mismatch lengths [22].\nIn Fig. 1, Db (r) of a typical configuration is shown\nat high and low temperature. The large domains where\n|Dj |2 \u2265 0.5 at low temperature clearly indicate large\nregions where the response to the quasi-static external\ndeformation is strongly correlated, in marked contrast to\nthe high temperature behavior.\nThese observations can be made more quantitative\nby studying the distribution of coarse-grained mismatch\nlengths hb (D2 ). For small b, only a single particle contributes to (1) and hb (D2 ) \u2192 \u03b4(D2 \u22121). For increasing b,\nDj includes more and more particles and therefore, with\nthe decay of correlations, hb accumulates more weight at\nsmall values of D2 until hb (D2 ) \u2192 \u03b4(D2 ) when b becomes\nlarge. The transition between mostly ordered (peak of\nhb near 1) and disordered (peak near 0) regions happens\nat a value of b which strongly increases with decreasing\ntemperature (see Fig. 2).\n\nThe coarse-graining length b is our means to probe the\nextent of correlations in the mismatch field on lengths\nup to b. Therefore, from the histogram hb (D2 ) we define a static correlation length \u03beB as the coarse-graining\ndistance b for which the peak-location has moved from\none to 1/e. Our results are robust and the conclusions\npresented here hold also for other definitions of \u03beB , see\n\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n3 .0 0\n\n4\n2\n0\n\nFIG. 1: (color online).

At high temperatures,\nthe typical value of D2 jumps from an ordered (D2 \u2248 1) to\na disordered one (D2 \u2248 0) when b becomes slightly larger\nthan the particle diameter. At low temperatures, instead,\nthis transition happens at much larger values of b.\n\nAppendix B. Figure 3 shows the correlation length \u03beB\nas a function of temperature. In the high temperature\nliquid phase we observe a low value of \u03beB of the order of\nthe particles diameter \u03c3, weakly dependent on temperature. In the supercooled regime, however, \u03beB increases\nconsiderably. For the lowest temperatures at which we\ncan equilibrate the system, T \u2248 0.40, we find \u03beB \u2248 4\u03c3\nfor the largest systems studied here.\nWe also observe in Fig. 3 a systematic finite-size effect\nof \u03beB (T ) in the supercooled regime, where the correlation\nlength grows with the linear size L of the system. We\ninvestigate this dependence in more detail because, together with the significant increase of \u03beB , this behavior is\ntypical of critical phenomena [30], where the correlation\nlength \u03be associated with the order parameter characterizing the transition diverges at the critical temperature\nTc as \u03be \u223c (T \u2212 Tc )\u2212\u03bd . Therefore, we perform the same\nfinite-size analysis which in critical phenomena is used to\nextract the critical behavior from data obtained in a finite\nsystem. If the increase of \u03beB upon lowering the temperature is indeed due to a diverging static correlation length\n\u03be underlying the glass transition, then \u03beB should diverge\nas well, and in the infinite system \u03beB (T ) \u223c t\u2212\u03c1 , where\nt = (T \u2212 Tc ) is the distance from the critical point Tc\nand \u03c1 the critical exponent. On the basis of the scaling\nhypothesis for critical phenomena [30], the corresponding\nquantity \u03beB,L (T ) in a finite system of linear size L should\nfollow the behavior\n\u03beB,L (T ) \u223c L\u03c1/\u03bd Q\u03beB (L1/\u03bd t),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Q\u03beB (x) is a universal scaling function and \u03bd is\nthe critical exponent associated to \u03be. Therefore, we\nplot \u03beB,L (T )L\u2212\u03c1/\u03bd as a function of the scaling variable\n(T \u2212 Tc )L1/\u03bd in Fig. 3. We identify the critical temperature Tc with the Kauzmann temperature TK , where a\nphase transition due to an entropy crisis should be located according to RFOT and related theories [3, 6]. For\nthe system used here, TK has been determined numerically as TK \u2248 0.30 [9, 31].

(2).\n\nobserve that the numerical data for different temperatures T and system sizes L collapse onto a single master\ncurve in agreement with Eq. (2). We find the best data\ncollapse for the critical exponents \u03c1 \u2248 0.9 \u00b1 0.1, and\n\u03bd \u2248 0.65 \u00b1 0.1, which is the case shown in Fig. 3. The\nvalue of \u03bd is very close to \u03bd = 2/3, which is indeed predicted by RFOT for three-dimensional systems [3] and to\n\u03bd \u2248 0.69 deduced from light scattering experiments on oterphenyl [10]. The value \u03bd = 2/3 is also compatible with\nrecent simulations [12], where, however, no proper finitesize scaling was performed. From the quality of data\ncollapse and the intersection of \u03beB (T )L\u2212\u03c1/\u03bd for different\nsystem sizes [30], we estimate that the critical temperature lies in the range 0.25 \u2264 Tc \u2264 0.4. Using the finitesize analysis in this range of temperatures we end up with\nthe estimates for the critical exponents \u03c1 \u2248 0.8 \u00b1 0.2 and\n\u03bd \u2248 0.7 \u00b1 0.15. The precision of these results is limited by the increase of \u03beB being too weak for the smallest\nsystem sizes, which is probably also the reason why previous studies could extract only small, roughly temperature\nindependent length scales from inherent structures [24].\nMoreover, the finite-size analysis in the vicinity of the\ncritical point is made extremely hard by the long equili-\n\n\u03beB / k B T\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n1 0\n\n0 .1 6\n\nT S\n\n0 .2 4\n\n0 .3 2\n\n0 .4\n\nc o n f\n\nFIG. 4: (a) The structural relaxation time \u03c4 is plotted versus static correlation length \u03beB for the system with N =\n64000 particles.

In spite of these limitations, the critical\nregion is apparently large enough to be felt in the accessible temperature regime.\nWithin RFOT, the increasing relaxation time \u03c4\nis linked to the free energy barrier of nucleating a\nnew structure of linear size \u03bem in the liquid, \u03c4 \u223c\nexp [B(T Sconf )\u2212\u03b8/(d\u2212\u03b8) ] \u223c exp [A(\u03bem /kB T )\u03b8 ] [3, 6, 19].\nThe configurational entropy per particle is denoted by\nSconf , d is the spatial dimension and \u03b8 = d \u2212 1/\u03bd the exponent of the interface free energy cost of a nucleus. This\ngives us the possibility to further check the consistency\nof our data with the RFOT scenario. In Fig. 4-a, we\nplot the relaxation time \u03c4 versus \u03beB /kB T on a doublelogarithmic scale. The relaxation times are large-N values of \u03c4 taken from Ref. [20], which have been determined therein from the final relaxation of the incoherent\nscattering function. The fitted line shows that the form\n\u03c4 \u223c exp [A(\u03be/kB T )\u03b8 ] \u223c exp [A0 (\u03beB /kB T )\u03b8\u03bd/\u03c1 ] indeed describes our numerical data quite well. The value of the\nexponent \u03b8 we obtain is \u03b8 \u2248 1.6 \u00b1 0.3. If we identify our\ncorrelation length \u03be with the mosaic length scale \u03bem in\nRFOT, this value of \u03b8 we find is in agreement with the\nprediction \u03b8 = d/2 of RFOT [3]. It is worth noting that\nour analysis is free of inconsistencies reported in Ref. [20]\nwhen looking at length scales from dynamical heterogeneity. We can also directly test the connection between\nconfigurational entropy Sconf and correlation length \u03be,\nwhich according to RFOT reads \u03be \u223c (T Sconf )\u22121/(d\u2212\u03b8) .\nIn Fig. 4-b, \u03beB is plotted as a function of T Sconf on a\ndouble-logarithmic scale. The data for the latter are\ntaken from Ref. [32]. Our results indicate that the re\u2212\u03c1\n\u03c1\nlation \u03beB \u223c \u03be \u03bd \u223c (T Sconf ) \u03bd(d\u2212\u03b8) is indeed valid for the\nlargest system we studied. For the exponent, we find\n(d \u2212 \u03b8)\u22121 \u2248 0.74 \u00b1 0.14 which again is in agreement with\nthe value 2/d predicted by RFOT and which in addition\nimplies the validity of the Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman expres-\n\n\f4\nsion \u03c4 \u223c exp [DT /(T \u2212 TK )] [3].\nDiscussion. \u2013 Bringing together concepts from inherent structure formalism of supercooled liquids and from\ndeformations of amorphous solids offers a new perspective on the long-standing glass problem. In this spirit, we\nhave employed a new method in order to elucidate growing static correlations in supercooled liquids. We found\ndirect evidence for the critical behavior of the static correlation length close to the glass transition, which has\nbeen speculated by several recent theories [3\u20136]. In particular, our estimates of the transition temperature, critical exponents, as well as the link with relaxational dynamics are in quantitative agreement with the predictions from RFOT [3]. However further studies are needed\nin order to determine the numerical values more precisely. Our results have important consequences for flowinduced rearrangements in colloidal glasses [33] and elastic response of amorphous solids [29], where similar cooperative behavior has been observed recently.\nOur study has been performed at constant density,\nwhere the critical temperature Tc extracted from \u03beB is\napparently below the lowest temperature at which we\nhave been able to equilibrate the system. However, the\ncritical point would not necessarily be located at the density chosen here and only a systematic investigation in the\n(T, P )-plane will shed further light on its existence, nature, and location. The long-standing problem of a true\nthermodynamic phase transition underlying the slowing\ndown of the dynamics at the glass transition can now be\naddressed from a different perspective, knowing that a\ndirect structural signature exists.\nAppendix A: Details of Numerical Simulations\n\nIn this study, we employ the well-known Kob-Andersen\nbinary Lennard-Jones mixture [23], which is a classical\nmodel for a glass forming liquid. Both types of particles\n(A and B) have the same unit mass and all particles\ninteract with each other via a Lennard-Jones potential,\nVab (r) = 4\u000fab [(\u03c3ab /r)12 \u2212 (\u03c3ab /r)6 ],\n\n(A1)\n\na, b \u2208 {A, B}, where r denotes the distance between particles. For computational convenience, the interactions\nare cut off at rc = 2.5\u03c3ab and shifted so that Vab (rc ) = 0.\nThe interaction energies and diameters for the different\nspecies are given by \u03c3AA = \u03c3, \u03c3AB = 0.8\u03c3, \u03c3BB = 0.88\u03c3,\n\u000fAA = \u000f, \u000fAB = 1.5\u000f, and \u000fBB = 0.5\u000f. The composition of A and B particles is chosen as 80:20 and the\nparticle density \u03c1 = N/V is \u03c1 = 1.2/\u03c3 3 . Simulations\nare performed in the N V T -ensemble, for a cubic simulation box subject to periodic boundary conditions. Standard molecular dynamics simulations are performed with\nthe simulation package LAMMPS [34], using the velocity Verlet integrator with a time step increasing with\ntemperature from \u2206t = 0.001 tref to 0.005 tref , where\ntref = (m\u03c302 /\u000f)1/2 is the reference Lennard-Jones time.\nAn ensemble of statistically independent configurations\n\nare generated at high temperatures and cooled slowly,\nby coupling the system to a Nos\u00e9-Hoover thermostat\nwith prescribed cooling protocol. The lowest temperature configurations have been equilibrated for 5 \u00d7 107\nMD steps. We use dimensionless temperature T measured in energy units \u000f. For the finite-size analysis we\nuse system consisting of N = 2000, 4000, 8000, 32000\nand 64000 particles, which correspond to system sizes of\nL = V 1/3 = 11.8, 14.9, 18.8, 29.84, and 37.6 \u03c3, respectively.\nWe obtain the inherent structure configurations X q\nfrom the equilibrated MD configurations X by locally\nminimizing the total potential energy Vtot =\nP\nV\n(rij ), using the conjugate gradient method. We\ni<j\nuse the Polak-Ribi\u00e8re version of the algorithm as implemented in LAMMPS [34]. The minimization is stopped\nwhen the potential energy change is less than a tolerance\nvalue 10\u22127 \u000f. We verified that the results are insensitive\nto a further decrease of the tolerance level.\n\nAppendix B: Definition of correlation length\n\nThe correlation length \u03beB can be defined from the distribution of coarse-grained mismatch vectors in slightly\ndifferent ways. In the manuscript, we have identified \u03beB with that value of b, where the peak location\nof hb has moved from 1 to 1/e. Alternatively, we\nhave\nalso considered that from the mean-squared lengths\nR\ny hb (y)dy = B(b)2 one can obtain the so-called coarsegraining function B(b), defined as the average mismatch\nlength when smeared out over a sphere of radius b,\nB(b) = hDj (b)2 i1/2 , as in Ref. [29]. By construction,\nB(0) = 1 and B \u2192 0 when the coarse-graining length\nb spans P\nthe whole system, since there is no overall mis0\nmatch,\nj dj \u2248 0. For high temperatures, B(b) decays so rapidly that we find it difficult to extract reliable values for the correlation length. For relatively low\ntemperatures, we observe an exponential decay B(b) \u221d\n0\n0\n.\n)], with a well-defined correlation length \u03beB\nexp [\u2212b/(2\u03beB\nThis regime is similar to the case of amorphous solids [29].\n0\nWe have introduced a factor 2 in the definition of \u03beB\nfor\na closer similarity to the choice in Ref. [29], where coarsegraining over cubic boxes of side lengths b was performed.\n0\nFor a sharply peaked distribution hb (y), \u03beB = \u03beB\n. In the\ngeneral case, they will give slightly different values but\n0\nwe have verified that the temperature dependence of \u03beB\nin the low temperature regime is fully consistent with the\nresults extracted from Fig. 3. Finally, we have also con00\nsidered the length scale \u03beB\n= b1/3 , where b1/3 is the value\nof b where one-third of the particles have D2j > 1/2 and\n00\ntwo-thirds D2j < 1/2. We expect \u03beB\nto be close to \u03beB but\nsomewhat smoother and less noisy since integration can\nremove ambiguities in locating the peak position. Also in\nthis case the temperature dependence is fully consistent\nwith the one of \u03beB .\n0\n00\nFigure S1 shows the correlation lengths \u03beB , \u03beB\n, \u03beB\naccording to the above definitions as a function of tempera-\n\n\f5\n6\n\n\u03beB\n\n\u03be' B\n\n5\n\nture.
