It has been argued by the\nprevious authors that the period of the oscillations corresponding to the field needed to add one\nvortex per two intrinsic Josephson junctions is associated with a moving triangular lattice of vortices\n(out-of-phase mode), while the period corresponding to one vortex per one junction is due to the\nsquare lattice (in-phase mode).

[1] and shortly thereafter by Kakeya et al.\n[2] and Hatano et al. [3]. These experiments all showed\noscillations in the flux-flow voltage and flux-flow resistance when a large magnetic field (of order several Tesla)\nwas applied parallel to the ab plane in the presence of\na small bias current in the c\u2013direction (of order a few\npercent of the critical current). The observed flux-flow\nvoltage oscillations typically showed two different oscillation periods. At the lowest magnetic fields the period was\n\u2206HT = \u03a60 /(2sL) corresponding to one extra flux quantum per two layers in the stack. Here \u03a60 is the magnetic\nflux quantum, s and L are the thickness and the length\nof the junction, respectively. At higher magnetic fields\nthere was a transition to a period \u2206HS = \u03a60 /(sL) , i.e.\ncorresponding to an extra flux quantum in every layer.\nThese exiting experiments were interpreted both analytically [4] and numerically [5, 6, 7] by several authors. One of the important questions to be answered\nwas whether the flux lattice correspond to a triangular\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic drawing of the triangular lattice (a) corresponding to the out-of-phase fluxon mode and the square\nlattice (b) associated with the in-phase fluxon mode.\n\nlattice (anti-phase ordering with possible cancellation of\nthe sum voltage at the junction end) or a square lattice (in-phase ordering leading to a large sum voltage\nat the junction end). Figure 1 shows schematically a\nBi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8+y stack with flux ordering in a triangular lattice and square lattice. Obviously, the latter case\nis highly preferable for applications to THz generation of\nelectromagnetic waves; however simple intuition would\nsuggest triangular ordering since fluxons of same polarity\nnaturally repel each other. An intuitive interpretation of\nthe experimentally observed oscillations in the flux-flow\nvoltage would suggest that an oscillation period \u2206HT\ncorresponds to triangular ordering while a period \u2206HS\ncorresponds to a square lattice. Numerical simulations\n[5, 6, 7] have shown that both triangular and square lattices are possible, but their relation to regions of \u2206HT\noscillations and regions of \u2206HS oscillations is not simple\nand details are still a matter of debate.\n\nIn this paper, we present fairly standard numerical simulations corresponding to the simplest case of a singlelayer Josephson junction. Even for this case, where there\nis no triangular nor square lattice ordering (as our stack\nconsists of only one junction), we find that both the \u2206HT\nand \u2206HS periods appear much the same way as in experiments and numerical simulations for Bi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8+y\nstacks with many layers and flux lattice ordering. After presenting the numerical simulations we provide a\nqualitative explanation in terms of the well-known Fiske\nmodes [8].\n\nThe system under investigation is described by coupled\n\n\f2\nform [9]:\n\uf8f6\n\n0.8\n\n(1)\n\nwith\nJi \u2261\n\n\u2202 2 \u03c6i\n\u2202\u03c6i\n+\u03b1\n+ sin \u03c6i \u2212 \u03b3 .\n\u2202t2\n\u2202t\n\n(2)\n\nHere \u03b1 = (1/R)[h\u0304/(2eI0 C)]1/2 is the dissipation parameter (R, I0 , and C are the normal resistance, the critical current and the capacitance per unit length, respectively), \u03b3 is the current normalized to the critical\ncurrent I0 of the individual junctions. The normalized\ncoupling term among the junctions in the stack reads\nS = \u2212\u03bbL /[d\u2032 sinh(t/\u03bbL )], where d\u2032 = d + 2\u03bbL coth(t/\u03bbL ),\nt is the thickness of one superconducting layer, and \u03bbL\nis the London penetration depth [9]. Time t is normalized to the inverse of the Josephson plasma frequency \u03c9p = [2eI0 /(h\u0304CJ )]1/2 and spatial coordinate\nx is normalized with respect to the Josephson length\n\u03bbJ = [h\u0304/(2e\u03bc0 I0 )]1/2 . The magnetic field gives rise to\nboundary conditions of the form [9]\n\u2202\u03c6i\n\u2202x\n\nx=0,l\n\nH\n=\n\u2261h.\n\u03bbJ I0\n\n(3)\n\nIndex i = 1, . . . , N stands here for the junction number\nin the stack and l is the normalized length of the system.\nFigure 2 shows the result of a simulation of the currentvoltage characteristics for only one junction in the stack,\ni.e. N = 1. It shows the flux-flow branch of the junction\nwith normalized length l = 40 and damping constant \u03b1 =\n0.1 placed in magnetic field h = 4. The characteristics is\ncalculated by rising the bias current \u03b3 from zero to 0.85\nand then decreasing it back to zero. The voltage V is\ngiven in normalized units chosen such that the voltage\nspacing between neighboring Fiske steps\n\u03a60 c\u0304\n\u2206V =\n2L\n\n(4)\n\nis equal to unity (here c\u0304 is the Swihart velocity and\nL = l\u03bbJ is the physical length of the junction). The\ncurrent-voltage characteristics displays fine structure due\nto the Fiske steps, which gather around the flux-flow voltage, also known as Eck peak [10]. The hysteresis in this\nvoltage region is due to the coexistence of several Fiske\nresonances at a given current \u03b3. Some parts of these Fiske\nresonances are located inside the hysteresis and are not\ndisplayed on the plot.\nUsing the above junction parameters, we calculated\nthe dependence of the flux-flow resistance on magnetic\n\n0.6\n\nbias current\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nvoltage (norm. units)\n\nFIG. 2: Current-voltage characteristics of a long junction\n(N = 1) with parameters l = 40, \u03b1 = 0.1, and h = 4.

Figure 3 presents the differential flux-flow resistance dV /d\u03b3 versus magnetic field h at the fixed bias\ncurrent \u03b3 = 0.3. It clearly shows flux-flow resistance oscillations. In order to relate the period of oscillations\nwith the number of vortices in the junction we show a\ngrid in magnetic field with a period \u2206h = 2\u03c0/Ll, which\napproximately corresponds to adding one vortex in the\njunction.

In Fig. 3\nwe see that most oscillations have a characteristic period\nin h corresponding to adding a half flux quantum into\nthe junction, with a tendency of doubling the period at\nhigher fields.\nAs another illustration, in Fig. 4 we show both static\nresistance V /\u03b3 and differential resistance dV /d\u03b3 versus\nmagnetic field h for the same junction but at a lower\nbias current \u03b3 = 0.2. The oscillations of dV /d\u03b3 (thin\ncurve) have two characteristic periods, which are found\nat different ranges of magnetic field h. The oscillation period at low fields corresponds to about or less than half\nflux quantum, while at higher fields we find very clear\noscillations which account for one flux quantum into the\njunction. The crossover from one regime to another occurs at magnetic field h \u2248 3. Below this field the differential resistance at \u03b3 = 0.2 is lower as it is determined\nby the Eck peak (see also Fig. 2) composed of individual Fiske steps. At h > 3 the Eck peak shifts to higher\n\n\u03b3(\u03c9, h) = \u03b1\u03c9 +\n\n+\u221e \u0014\nX\n\u2212\u221e\n\ncurrents and the differential resistance levels at the resistive slope determined by the loss parameter \u03b1 of the\njunction. The static junction resistance (upper curve in\nFig. 4) also changes in this range but its oscillations are\nmuch less pronounced and can only be clearly seen on\nthe magnified scale.\nWe suggest the following explanation for the two oscillation periods of the flux-flow resistance in a singlebarrier Josephson junction. At high enough magnetic\nfield the resistance at a low bias current follows oscillations of the critical current of the junction and thus\nhave a characteristic period of one flux quantum. At the\nsame time, the resistance measured at a higher current\n(or lower field but the same bias current) follows the oscillations due to the Fiske steps, which envelope is associated with the Eck peak (sometimes called as flux-flow or\nvelocity matching step). The matter is that \u2013 for a single\njunction \u2013 the Fiske steps induce a variation of the resistance with characteristic period corresponding to half\nflux quantum.\nFiske modes in a Josephson junction [8] are linear cavity type excitations with resonance angular frequencies\ngiven by\n\u03c9n = n\n\nn = 1, 2, 3, . . .\n\n(5)\n\nin normalized units.

(4). The amplitude of the Fiske\nsteps oscillate with the magnetic field in a typical Bessel\nfunction like pattern such that the even numbered steps\nhave maxima together with maxima in the critical current, while maxima in the odd numbered steps correspond to minima in the critical current.

(7) with parameters l = 40 and \u03b1 = 0.1. The voltage\nis multiplied by a factor l/\u03c0 to make its scale identical to the\nvoltage normalization used in the previous figures.\n\nal. [12] shows that Eq. (7) can approximately account\nfor the shape and for the maximum current modulation\nof the Fiske singularities in long (l \u226b 1) junctions when\nthe field penetration overcomes Meissner shielding, i.e.\nat h > 2.\nThe first term in Eq. (7) represents the Ohmic part of\nthe current-voltage characteristics, while the second term\ngives an infinite series of equidistant resonances. The\nheight of the resonances is modulated by a slowly varying\namplitude factor and a fast Fraunhofer amplitude factor\n[12]. The Fraunhofer factor emphasizes the resonance\nclosest to \u03c9 = h and drops off fast: If hl is an even\nmultiple of \u03c0, the odd numbered Fiske steps are enhanced\nand if hl is an odd multiple of \u03c0, the even numbered Fiske\nsteps survive.\nEquation (7) gives the current-voltage curve containing Fiske steps with the magnetic field as a parameter.\nIf we instead assume a fixed bias current \u03b3 and vary the\nmagnetic field, Eq. (7) expresses the voltage V \u221d \u03c9 oscillations in an implicit form. In order to compare this\nanalytical form with our simulations, we solved Eq. (7)\nfor \u03c9 at a given \u03b3 numerically. The obtained the dependence of the flux-flow resistance dV /d\u03b3 at constant bias\ncurrent \u03b3 = 0.2 versus magnetic field h is presented in\nFig. 5. The qualitative agreement between Figs. 3 and\n4 obtained by full numerical simulation of the perturbed\nsine-Gordon equation and Fig. 5 emerging from the analytical formula (7) is strikingly good. Figure 5 clearly\n\ndisplays two characteristic periods of oscillations, namely\nhalf flux quantum oscillations at low fields and one flux\nquantum oscillations which become very explicit at high\nfields. The intermediate field range shows a complicated\nbeating between two periods.\nThus, odd and even numbered Fiske resonances in\nthe last term in Eq. (7) produce the \"magic\" half-fluxquantum oscillations corresponding to the magnetic field\nperiod \u2206HT = \u03a60 /(2sL) even in a single Josephson junction. Although we investigated here Fiske steps with\nN = 1, we note that Fiske steps are also present in stacks\nwith N > 1 [13]. Thus we are lead to suggest that also\nfor N > 1 the flux-flow voltage oscillations have their\norigin in the Fiske mode excitations.\nWe conclude that for Bi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8+y stacks the\nflux-flow voltage oscillations with two different periods\nin a magnetic field have their origin in the Fiske mode\nexcitations. Thus the flux lattice ordering in either triangular or square lattice is not directly related to the\ntwo periods of the oscillations. We speculate that Fiske\nmodes also existing in stacks indirectly play a role for the\nflux lattice formation.\nWe would like to acknowledge discussions with T.\nHatano, S. Kim, A. E. Koshelev, S.
