We used the Trocheries-Takeno mapping to relate measurements in\nthe inertial and the rotating frames. An exact solution of the Klein-Gordon equation in the rotating\ncoordinate system is found and the Bogolubov transformation between the inertial and rotating\nmodes is calculated, showing that the rotating observer defines a vacuum state different from the\nMinkowski one.

The response function is obtained for\ntwo different situations: when the quantum field is prepared in the usual Minkowski vacuum state\nand when it is prepared in the Trocheries-Takeno vacuum state. We also consider the case of an\ninertial detector interacting with the field in the rotating vacuum.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe key point of special relativity is that the Poincar\u00e9 group is the symmetry group of all physical systems. The\ndefinitions of the Lorentz and Poincar\u00e9 groups are based as groups of mappings that leave invariant the flat metric. The\nnatural consequence is that an inertial observer (in an inertial reference frame) can assign a time and space location\nto any event occurring in space-time, using light clocks, etc. To obtain a \"physical\" interpretation of the Poincar\u00e9\nmapping we have to derive general relations between the space-time measurements made by different observers who\nare in different inertial frames.\nSo far, we have been considering only classes of measuring devices in inertial reference frames. However, suppose\nwe are to make measurements with a device in non-inertial frames, as for example in a rotating disc. To discuss such\nmeasurements and to show how they can be incorporated into a space-time description, entails that distance and time\nmeasurements made with some arbitrary set of measuring devices can always be made to correspond to the coordinates\nof space-time by means of a suitable space-time mapping. In other words, in order to compare measurements made\nby inertial and non-inertial (e.g. rotating) observers, we must present the mapping that relates the measurements\nmade with the two different sets of devices.\nFor example, in a Galilean scenario it is possible to relate the space and time measurements made in a rotating\nframe to those in an inertial one by the mapping:\nt = t\u2032 ,\nr = r\u2032 ,\n\u03b8 = \u03b8\u2032 \u2212 \u03a9t\u2032 ,\nz = z \u2032,\n\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03a9 is the constant angular velocity around the z axis of the inertial frame. In the above, the cylindrical coordinate\nsystem x\u2032\u03bc = {t\u2032 , r\u2032 , \u03b8\u2032 , z \u2032 } is adapted to an inertial observer and the rotating coordinate system x\u03bc = {t, r, \u03b8, z} is\nthe one adapted to the rotating observer. Although some authors tried to construct the counterpart of this mapping\nincorporating special relativity [1], the final answer for this question is still open.\nIn two recent papers [2] it is assumed that the mapping which relates the inertial frame with the rotating one is\ngiven by:\n\n\u2217\n\nElectronic mail: lorenci@cpd.efei.br\nElectronic mail: rpaola@lafex.cbpf.br\n\u2021\nElectronic mail: nfuxsvai@lafex.cbpf.br\n\n\u2020\n\n1\n\n\ft = t\u2032 cosh \u03a9r\u2032 \u2212 r\u2032 \u03b8\u2032 sinh \u03a9r\u2032 ,\nr = r\u2032 ,\nt\u2032\n\u03b8 = \u03b8\u2032 cosh \u03a9r\u2032 \u2212 \u2032 sinh \u03a9r\u2032 ,\nr\nz = z \u2032.\n\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\n(8)\n\nSuch group of transformations was presented a long time ago by Trocheries and also Takeno [3]. In Takeno's derivation,\nthree assumptions were made: (i) the transformation laws constitute a group; (ii) for small velocities we must recover\nthe usual linear velocity law (v = \u03a9r); and (iii) the velocity composition law is also in agreement with special\nrelativity. In fact, the above transformation predicts that the velocity of a point at distance r from the axis is given\nby v(r) = tanh(\u03a9r).\nIt is our purpose, in this work, to investigate how does an uniformly rotating observer see the Minkowski vacuum.\nIn this direction we performed the quantization of a scalar field as an observer who rotates uniformly around some\nfixed point would do it. We assume the Trocheries-Takeno transformations (5-8) to compare measurements made in\nthe inertial and in the rotating frames.\nThe canonical quantization of a scalar field in the rotating frame, related to the inertial one through coordinate\ntransformations (1-4), was made by Denardo and Percacci and also by Letaw and Pfautsch [4]. To compare the\nquantizations performed in the inertial and rotating frames, the authors calculated the Bogolubov transformation\n[5] between the inertial modes \u03c8i (t\u2032 , r\u2032 , \u03b8\u2032 , z \u2032 ) and the modes adapted to the rotating frame, \u03c8 j (t, r, \u03b8, z). Since they\nfound that the Bogolubov coefficients \u03b2ij are null, they conclude that the rotating vacuum or no-particle state, as\ndefined by the rotating observer, is just the Minkowski vacuum |0, M i.\nAnother way to compare different quantizations is to study the vacuum activity of a quantum field, and this is\nperformed introducing a measuring device which couples with the quantum field via an interaction Lagrangian. (In the\nfollowing discussion we will take into account the detector model due to Unruh and De Witt [6,7].) Using first-order\nperturbation theory, it is possible to calculate the probability of excitation per unit proper time (excitation rate) of\nsuch a detector, that is, the probability per unit time that the detector, travelling in a given world-line and initially\nprepared in its ground state, to wind up in an excited state when it interacts with the field in a given state [8]. As\nan example, consider that the detector is in an inertial frame and the field is prepared in the Minkowski vacuum\nstate. In this situation the detector will remain in the ground state (null excitation rate). This is easily understood,\nbecause there are no inertial particles in the Minkowski vacuum state. On the other hand, if the detector is put in a\nworld-line of an observer with constant proper acceleration and the field is prepared again in the Minkowski vacuum,\nthe detector has a non-null probability to suffer a transition to an excited state. This is the so-called Unruh-Davies\neffect and the quantitative result is in agreement with the fact that the Minkowski vacuum state is seen as a thermal\nstate by the accelerated observer, with temperature proportional to its proper acceleration [6]. The construction of\na quantum field theory with the implementation of the Fock space in Rindler's manifold leads to define the Rindler\nvacuum state |0, Ri. For completeness, in the situation when the field is prepared in such a state and the detector is\nuniformly accelerated, the detector remains inert. Again one is tempted to conclude that this is so because there are\nno Rindler particles in |0, Ri to be detected in the uniformly accelerated frame.\nThe agreement between the response of a detector and canonical quantum field theory seems not to occur for more\ngeneral situations. Indeed, as was shown by Letaw and Pfautsch, if the detector is put in a uniformly rotating worldline and the field is prepared in the Minkowski vacuum state |0, M i, it is found a non-null excitation rate, in spite\nof the fact that |0, M i is considered as the vacuum state for a rotating observer, as discussed above. The rotating\ndetector is excited even though there are no particles as an orbiting observer would define them (see also [9]).\nRecently Davies et al [10] (see also [11]) solved this paradox, still assuming the Galilean coordinate transformations\n(1-4) between the inertial and rotating frames. First of all note that the world-line of an observer in the rotating\n1\nframe is an integral curve of the Killing vector \u03be = (1 \u2212 \u03a92 r2 )\u2212 2 \u2202/\u2202t, which is timelike only for \u03a9r < 1. Therefore,\nfor a given angular velocity \u03a9 there will be a maximum value of the radial coordinate rmax = 1/\u03a9 (the light cylinder)\nfor which an observer a distance r > rmax will be moving faster than light. The Bogolubov coefficient \u03b2 is a\nscalar product over a spacelike hypersurface, where the radial coordinate ranges over 0 \u2264 r < \u221e and the notion of\nBogolubov transformations outside the light cylinder becomes obscure. In order to circumvent this problem, Davies\net al introduced a perfectly conducting cylinder with radius a < rmax and they prove that the response of the\ndetector vanishes when it is put a distance r < a from the rotation axis. They conclude that \"a rotating particle\ndetector corotating with a rotating vacuum state registers the absence of quanta\", although they continue to regard\nthe Minkowski vacuum as the rotating vacuum state.\nThe aim of this paper is two-fold. The first one is to present an exact solution of the Klein-Gordon equation in\nthe Trocheries-Takeno coordinate system and to show that the Bogolubov coefficients \u03b2 between inertial and rotating\nmodes are not zero. This fact proves that there is a Trocheries-Takeno vacuum state adapted to rotating observers.\n2\n\n\fThe second one is to analyse the behavior of an apparatus device, a detector which is coupled with the scalar field\ntravelling in inertial or rotating world-lines, interacting with the field in the Minkowski or the Trocheries-Takeno\nvacuum states.\nWe organize this paper as follows. In Section II we second quantize a massless scalar field in Takeno's rotating\ncoordinate system, and also compare this quantization with the usual one in the inertial frame via the calculation of\nthe Bogolubov coefficients. In Section III we introduce the measuring apparatus \u2013 the Unruh-De Witt detector [6].\nWe calculate its response function when it is rotating and the field is prepared in two different states: the TrocheriesTakeno vacuum state and the Minkowski vacuum state. We also consider the case of an inertial detector interacting\nwith the field in the rotating vacuum. Conclusions are given in Section IV. In this paper we use h\u0304 = c = kB = 1.\nII. CANONICAL QUANTIZATION IN THE INERTIAL AND ROTATING FRAMES\n\nIn this section we will make a comparison between the quantizations of the massless Klein-Gordon field performed\nin the inertial frame and in the rotating one (Trocheries-Takeno), when the two coordinate systems are related by the\nmapping (5-8). Such a comparison will be made by calculating the Bogolubov transformation [5] between the inertial\nand rotating modes, solutions of the respective Klein-Gordon equations. For the quantization in the inertial frame\none chooses cylindrical coordinates on t\u2032 = constant hypersurfaces and writes the Klein-Gordon equation in terms of\nthem. We just quote the results of refs. [4]. Positive-frequency modes (with respect to inertial time t\u2032 ), solutions of\nthe Klein-Gordon equation, are found to be:\n\u2032 \u2032\n\n\u2032 \u2032\n\n\u2032 \u2032\n\nvq\u2032 m\u2032 k\u2032 (t\u2032 , r\u2032 , \u03b8\u2032 , z \u2032 ) = N1 eik z +im \u03b8 e\u2212i\u03c9 t Jm\u2032 (q \u2032 r\u2032 ),\n\n(9)\n1\n\nwhere \u03c9 \u2032 2 = q \u2032 2 + k \u2032 2 , Jm\u2032 (q \u2032 r\u2032 ) are Bessel functions well-behaved at the origin and N1 = q \u2032 2 [2\u03c0(2\u03c9 \u2032 )1/2 ]\u22121 is a\nnormalization factor. In the above, m\u2032 = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13, . . ., 0 \u2264 q \u2032 < \u221e and \u2212\u221e < k \u2032 < \u221e.

In the above, the modes vi and vi\u2217 are called,\nrespectively, positive and negative frequency modes with respect to the Killing vector \u2202/\u2202t\u2032 . It is important to stress\nthat in stationary geometries, such as the Minkowski space-time, the definition of positive and negative frequency\nmodes has no ambiguities. The Minkowski vacuum state is then defined by\nbq\u2032 m\u2032 k\u2032 |0, M i = 0,\n\n\u2200 q \u2032 , m\u2032 , k \u2032 .\n\n(11)\n\nNow we shall consider the quantization in the rotating frame. Assuming the mapping (5-8) to connect measurements\nmade in the rotating frame and those made in the inertial one, the line element in the rotating coordinates assumes\nthe non-stationary form [2]:\nds2 = dt2 \u2212 (1 + P )dr2 \u2212 r2 d\u03b82 \u2212 dz 2 + 2Qdrd\u03b8 + 2Sdtdr,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere P, Q and S are given by:\n\u03a9\nY\n+ 4\u03a9\u03b8t) sinh2 \u03a9r \u2212 (t2 + r2 \u03b82 ) sinh 2\u03a9r + \u03a92 Y,\nr2\nr\n1\n2\nQ = r\u03b8 sinh \u03a9r \u2212 t sinh 2\u03a9r + \u03a9rt,\n2\nt\n1\n2\nS = sinh \u03a9r \u2212 \u03b8 sinh 2\u03a9r \u2212 \u03a9r\u03b8,\nr\n2\nP =(\n\n(13)\n(14)\n(15)\n\nwith Y = (t2 \u2212 r2 \u03b82 ). Note that this metric presents no event horizons. In order to implement the canonical\nquantization first we have to solve the Klein-Gordon equation in the Trocheries-Takeno coordinate system:\n\u2737\u03c6(t, r, \u03b8, z) = 0.\n\n3\n\n(16)\n\n\fIt is possible to show that a complete set, basis in the space of solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation is given by\n{uqmk , u\u2217qmk }, in which\n\u0011 i\nh\n\u0010m\nsinh \u03a9r + \u03c9 cosh \u03a9r t Jm (qr),\nuqmk (t, r, \u03b8, z) = N2 eikz exp i (m cosh \u03a9r + \u03c9r sinh \u03a9r) \u03b8 \u2212 i\nr\n\n(17)\n\nwhere \u03c9 2 = q 2 + k 2 and N2 is a normalization factor. Again, m = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13, . . ., 0 \u2264 q < \u221e and \u2212\u221e < k < \u221e.\nOne sees that these modes are well-behaved throughout the whole manifold. Making use of the transformations (5-8)\none can show that these modes are of positive frequency by using the criterium of di Sessa [12], which states that a\ngiven mode is of positive frequency if it vanishes in the limit (t\u2032 ) \u2192 \u2212i\u221e, where t\u2032 is the inertial time coordinate,\nwhile u\u2217j are modes of negative frequency. In this way, the field operator is expanded in terms of these modes as:\n\u0010\n\u0011\nXZ\n\u03c6(t, r, \u03b8, z) =\ndq dk aqmk uqmk (t, r, \u03b8, z) + a\u2020qmk u\u2217qmk (t, r, \u03b8, z) ,\n(18)\nm\n\nwhere the coefficients aqmk and a\u2020qmk are, respectively, the annihilation and creation operators of the TrocheriesTakeno quanta of the field. The vacuum state defined by the rotating observer is thus the Trocheries-Takeno vacuum\nstate |0, T i and it is given by\naqmk |0, T i = 0,\n\n\u2200 q, m, k.\n\n(19)\n\nThe many-particle states of the theory can be obtained through successive applications of the creation operators on\nthe vacuum state.\nWe are now ready to compare both quantizations by using the Bogolubov transformations [5]. Since both sets of\nmodes are complete, one can expand modes (9) in terms of modes (17) and vice-versa, the coefficients of this expansion\nbeing called Bogolubov coefficients. For instance:\nX\n\u03b1ij vj (x) + \u03b2ij vj\u2217 (x)\n(20)\nui (x) =\nj\n\nand conversely:\nX\n\nvj (x) =\n\ni\n\n\u03b1\u2217ij ui (x) \u2212 \u03b2ij u\u2217i (x),\n\n(21)\n\n\u0001\nwhere \u03b1jj \u2032 = (uj , vj \u2032 ) and \u03b2jj \u2032 = \u2212 uj , vj\u2217\u2032 , where the scalar product is defined by:\n(\u03c6, \u03c7) = \u2212i\n\nZ\n\n\u03a3\n\n\u221a\nd\u03a3\u03bc \u2212g [\u03c6 \u2202\u03bc \u03c7\u2217 \u2212 \u03c7\u2217 \u2202\u03bc \u03c6] ,\n\n(22)\n\nwith d\u03a3\u03bc = n\u03bc d\u03a3, where n\u03bc is a future-oriented unit vector orthogonal to the spacelike hypersurface \u03a3. As \u03a3 we\nwill choose the hypersurface t\u2032 = 0, t\u2032 being the inertial time. The relevant coefficient for our present analysis is\nthe \u03b2 coefficient since it is this coefficient which gives the content of rotating particles in the Minkowski vacuum [5],\nand for such a calculation we need to express the rotating modes uj (x) in terms of the inertial coordinates, using\ntransformations (5-8). In this way:\n\u2032\n\nuqmk (t\u2032 , r\u2032 , \u03b8\u2032 , z \u2032 ) = N2 eikz exp (i\u03b8\u2032 [m cosh 2\u03a9r\u2032 + \u03c9r\u2032 sinh 2\u03a9r\u2032 ])\ni\u0011\nh\n\u0010\nm\n\u00d7 exp \u2212it\u2032 \u03c9 cosh 2\u03a9r\u2032 + \u2032 sinh 2\u03a9r\u2032 Jm (qr\u2032 )\nr\n\n(23)\n\nand the Bogolubov coefficient \u03b2jj \u2032 is written as:\n\u03b2jj \u2032\n\n\u221e\n\n\u221e\n\n2\u03c0\n\n\u0015\n\u2032\n\u2202vj \u2032 (x\u2032 )\n\u2032 \u2202uj (x )\n= +i\nr dr\ndz\nd\u03b8 uj (x )\n\u2212 vj \u2032 (x )\n\u2202t\u2032\n\u2202t\u2032\n0\n\u2212\u221e\n0\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\nh\ni\n\u2032\n\u2032\nm\n= N1 N2\ndz \u2032 ei(k+k )z\nr\u2032 dr\u2032 \u03c9 \u2032 \u2212 \u03c9 cosh 2\u03a9r\u2032 \u2212 \u2032 sinh 2\u03a9r\u2032 Jm\u2032 (q \u2032 r\u2032 )Jm (qr\u2032 )\nr\n\u2212\u221e\n0\nZ 2\u03c0\n\u00d7\nd\u03b8\u2032 exp (i\u03b8\u2032 [m\u2032 + m cosh 2\u03a9r\u2032 + \u03c9r\u2032 sinh 2\u03a9r\u2032 ]) .\nZ\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nZ\n\n\u2032\n\nZ\n\n\u2032\n\n\u0014\n\n\u2032\n\n0\n\n4\n\n(24)\n\n\fThe first integral is easily evaluated to a delta function 2\u03c0\u03b4(k + k \u2032 ), while the third one gives us:\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\n\u22121\n\nd\u03b8\u2032 exp (i\u03b8\u2032 Am,m\u2032 (r\u2032 , \u03c9)) = (iAm,m\u2032 (r\u2032 , \u03c9))\n\n0\n\n[exp (2\u03c0iAm,m\u2032 (r\u2032 , \u03c9)) \u2212 1] ,\n\nwhere\nAm,m\u2032 (r\u2032 , \u03c9) = m\u2032 + m cosh 2\u03a9r\u2032 + \u03c9r\u2032 sinh 2\u03a9r\u2032 .\n\n(25)\n\nThus, we obtain\n\u03b2jj \u2032 = 2\u03c0N1 N2 \u03b4(k + k \u2032 )\n\n\u221e\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u22121\n\n\u00d7 (iAm,m\u2032 (r\u2032 , \u03c9))\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\nm\nr\u2032 dr\u2032 \u03c9 \u2032 \u2212 \u03c9 cosh 2\u03a9r\u2032 \u2212 \u2032 sinh 2\u03a9r\u2032 Jm\u2032 (q \u2032 r\u2032 )Jm (qr\u2032 )\nr\n\n[exp (2\u03c0iAm,m\u2032 (r\u2032 , \u03c9)) \u2212 1] .\n\n(26)\n\nThe resulting expression is difficult to evaluate, but nonetheless it is non-zero. (In the appendix we give an indirect\nproof that it is non-zero.) This means that the two vacua considered are non-equivalent, i.e., |0, M i =\n6 |0, T i, which\nmeans that the Minkowski vacuum |0, M i contains rotating quanta, i.e., Trocheries-Takeno particles [5].\nIII. DETECTOR EXCITATION RATE\n\nWe now pass to consider the probability of excitation of a detector which is moving in a circular path at constant\nangular velocity \u03a9 and at a distance R0 from the rotation axis, interacting with the scalar field. The initial state of\nthe detector is its ground state and for the initial state of the field we will consider the two vacuum states: the usual\nMinkowski vacuum state and also the Trocheries-Takeno vacuum state. The interaction with the field may cause\ntransitions between the energy levels of the detector and if it is found, after the interaction, in an excited state, one\ncan say that it has detected a vacuum fluctuation of the field [11].\nAs a detector we shall be considering mainly the detector model of Unruh-De Witt [6,7], which is a system with two\ninternal energy eigenstates with monopole matrix element between these two states different from zero. According to\nstandard theory [8], the probability of excitation per unit proper time of such a system (normalized by the selectivity\nof the detector), or simply, its excitation rate, is given by:\nZ \u221e\nd\u2206t e\u2212iE\u2206t G+ (x, x\u2032 ),\n(27)\nR(E) =\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere \u2206t = t \u2212 t\u2032 , E > 0 is the difference between the excited and ground state energies of the detector and\nG+ (x, x\u2032 ) is the positive-frequency Wightman function calculated along the detector's trajectory. Let us note that\nthe positive-frequency Wightman function is given by\nG+ (x, x\u2032 ) = h0|\u03c6(x)\u03c6(x\u2032 )|0i ,\n\n(28)\n\nwhere |0i is the vacuum state of the field, which can either be |0, M i or |0, T i. Let us consider first the second\npossibility.\nIf one splits the field operator in its positive and negative frequency parts with respect to the Trocheries-Takeno\ntime coordinate t, as \u03c6(x) = \u03c6+ (x) + \u03c6\u2212 (x), where \u03c6+ (x) contains only annihilation operators and \u03c6\u2212 (x) contains\nonly creation operators (see Eq.(18)), and also considers |0i as the Trocheries-Takeno vacuum state, i.e., |0i = |0, T i\nthen, using Eq.(19), one finds that:\nX\nui (x)u\u2217i (y),\n(29)\nG+\nT (x, y) =\ni\n\nwhere the subscript T stands for the Wightman function calculated in the Trocheries-Takeno vacuum state. Considering now the modes given by Eq.(17) and that we are interested in the situation where the detector is at rest in the\nTrocheries-Takeno frame, i.e., \u03b8 = constant, z = constant and r = R0 = constant, one finds:\nG+\nT (x, y) =\n\nZ\n\u221e\nX\n\nm=\u2212\u221e\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\ndq\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\ndk N22 e\n\nm\n\u2212i[ R\nsinh \u03a9R0 +\u03c9 cosh \u03a9R0 ]\u2206t 2\n0\nJm (qR0 ).\n\n5\n\n(30)\n\n\fPutting the above expression in Eq.(27), we find:\n(r)\n\nRT (E, R0 ) =\n\nZ\n\u221e\nX\n\nm=\u2212\u221e\n\n\u221e\n\ndq\n\n0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n2\ndk N22 Jm\n(qR0 )\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nm\n\nd\u2206t e\u2212i[E+ R0\n\nsinh \u03a9R0 +\u03c9 cosh \u03a9R0 ]\u2206t\n\n.\n\n(31)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(In the above, the subscript T stands for the Takeno vacuum\n\u0011 for the rotating world-line\n\u0010 and the superscript (r) stands\n\nfollowed by the detector.) The last integral gives us 2\u03c0\u03b4 E + Rm0 sinh \u03a9R0 + \u03c9 cosh \u03a9R0 , for which the argument is\nnon-null only if m < 0; we can take the summation index to run for m = 1, 2, 3, ..., leaving us with\n(r)\n\nRT (E, R0 ) = 2\u03c0\n\n\u221e Z\nX\n\nm=1\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\ndq\n\n\u221e\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nm\n2\ndk N22 Jm\n(qR0 ) \u03b4 E \u2212\nsinh \u03a9R0 + \u03c9 cosh \u03a9R0 .\nR0\n\u2212\u221e\n\nZ\n\n(32)\n\nThe above expression predicts excitation for the detector, and depends in a non-trivial way on the position R0 where\nit is put. So we once again arrive at the same confrontation between canonical quantum field theory and the detector\nformalism, which was settled by Letaw and Pfautsch and Padmanabhan: how is it possible for the orbiting detector\nto be excited in the rotating vacuum? However a crucial distinction exists between our present analysis and the\nabove-mentioned works: we state, as proved in the last section, that the rotating vacuum is not the Minkowski\nvacuum. We now analyse the two independent origins of the non-null excitation rate, Eq.(32).\nNote that the present situation of an Unruh-De Witt detector being excited when put in an orbiting world-line\ninteracting with the field in the rotating (Trocheries-Takeno) vacuum is to be contrasted with the two following\nsituations. In fact, this same detector is not excited whether it is in an inertial world-line and interacting with the\nfield in the inertial (Minkowski) vacuum [5,8] or when it is uniformly accelerated and interacting with the field in the\naccelerated (Rindler) vacuum [13]. However note that both Minkowski and Rindler space-times are static, differently\nof the Trocheries-Takeno metric, and differently also of the rotating metric obtained using the galilean transformation,\nwhich are examples of non-static metrics. Recall that using instead the galilean transformation to a rotating frame\nit was also found by Letaw and Pfautsch a non-null excitation rate for the orbiting detector in the rotating vacuum,\nconsidered by them as |0, M i. Therefore the excitation in the present case may be attributed to the non-staticity of\nthe Trocheries-Takeno metric.\nThe other origin of the excitation found above for the detector can be atributed to the detector model we adopted\n[14]. Indeed, note that splitting the field operator in its positive and negative frequency parts with respect to rotating\ntime t in Eq.(28), one can express the Wightman function as:\nG+ (x, x\u2032 ) = h0|\u03c6(x)\u03c6(x\u2032 )|0i\n= 0|\u03c6+ (x)\u03c6+ (x\u2032 )|0 + 0|\u03c6+ (x)\u03c6\u2212 (x\u2032 )|0\n+ 0|\u03c6\u2212 (x)\u03c6+ (x\u2032 )|0 + 0|\u03c6\u2212 (x)\u03c6\u2212 (x\u2032 )|0 .\n\n(33)\n\nIn the case where |0i = |0, T i, because of Eq.(19) only the second term above is non-vanishing, corresponding to the\nemission (creation) of a Trocheries-Takeno quantum with simultaneous excitation of the detector and this is the term\nresponsible for the non-vanishing excitation rate, Eq.(32). In the context of quantum optics photodetection is regarded\nas photoabsorption processes only [15,16], a detector being able to be excited only when it absorbs (annihilates) a\nquantum of the field. In this way terms like the second one above are discarded and only terms like the third one are\ntaken into account, such a procedure being called the rotating-wave approximation [16]. Therefore purely absorptive\ndetectors (Glauber model) always give vanishing excitation rate in the vacuum state of the field. From this discussion,\nit is clear that the Glauber detector model will not be excited when put in the orbiting world-line and the field is in\nthe Trocheries-Takeno vacuum state. Another context in which the inclusion of the antiresonant term (second one\nabove) plays a crucial role is that of accelerated observers, where the thermal character of the Minkowski vacuum\nas seen by a Rindler observer is not revealed if one uses the Glauber correlation function, but only if one uses the\nWightman one. In effect, the Wightman correlation function includes the vacuum fluctuations that are omitted in\nthe Glauber function [14], and to these very vacuum fluctuations can be attributed the non-vanishing excitation rate\nEq.(32). Because of this feature the model of Unruh-De Witt is also called a fluctuometer [17].\nWe now discuss the other case of putting the detector in an orbiting trajectory and preparing the scalar field in\nthe usual inertial vacuum |0, M i. Writing |0, M i for |0i in Eq.(28), it is easy to show that the positive frequency\nWightman function is given by:\nX\n\u2032 \u2032\nvj (x\u2032 )vj\u2217 (y \u2032 ),\n(34)\nG+\nM (x , y ) =\nj\n\n6\n\n\fwhere M stands for the Minkowski vacuum state. As the rate of excitation Eq.(27) is given in terms of the detector's\nproper time, we shall express Eq.(34) in terms of the rotating coordinates, using the inverse of Takeno's transfor\u2032 \u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nmations. Let us begin with G+\nM (x , y ), in inertial coordinates, with identifications r1 = r2 = R0 and z1 = z2 , as\ndemanded for this case:\nZ \u221e Z \u221e\n\u221e\nX\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032 \u2032\n2\nG+\n(x\n,\ny\n)\n=\ndq\ndkN12 e\u2212i\u03c9(t1 \u2212t2 )+im(\u03b81 \u2212\u03b82 ) Jm\n(qR0 ).\n(35)\nM\n0\n\nm=\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThe inverse of Takeno's transformations read\nt\u2032 = t cosh \u03a9r + r\u03b8 sinh \u03a9r,\nr\u2032 = r,\nt\n\u03b8\u2032 = \u03b8 cosh \u03a9r + sinh \u03a9r,\nr\nz \u2032 = z.\n\n(36)\n(37)\n(38)\n(39)\n\nUsing the above in Eq.(35) and taking note of the fact that the detector is at rest in the rotating frame, i.e., \u03b81 = \u03b82 , we\nsee that in this manner the Minkowski Wightman function is a function of the difference in proper time \u2206t = t1 \u2212 t2 ,\nwhich allows us to calculate the rate of excitation of the orbiting detector when the field is in the Minkowski vacuum:\n(r)\n\nRM (E, R0 ) = 2\u03c0\n\n\u221e Z\nX\n\nm=1\n\n\u221e\n\ndq\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nm\n2\ndk N12 Jm\n(qR0 ) \u03b4 E \u2212\nsinh \u03a9R0 + \u03c9 cosh \u03a9R0 .\nR0\n\u2212\u221e\n\nZ\n\n(40)\n\nThe result above is very much like Eq.(32), with the exception that in the above it appears the normalization of the\ninertial modes N1 instead of N2 .\nFinally, let us suppose that it is possible to prepare the field in the rotating vacuum and the detector is in an inertial\nworld-line and let us calculate the excitation rate in this situation:\nZ \u221e\n\u2032\n(i)\n\u2032 \u2032\nd\u2206t\u2032 e\u2212iE\u2206t G+\n(41)\nRT (E, R0 ) =\nT (x , y ),\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere the superscript (i) stands for the inertial world-line followed by the detector, \u2206t\u2032 is the difference in proper\n\u2032 \u2032\ntime in the inertial frame, and G+\nT (x , y ) is given by Eq.(29), but written now in terms of the inertial coordinates. It\n+ \u2032 \u2032\nis not difficult to write GT (x , y ) in terms of the inertial coordinates, recalling that now the detector is not at rest in\nthe rotating frame.

Since in the first\ncase we found a non-null rate, contrary to the idea that the orbiting detector co-rotating with the rotating vacuum\nshould not perceive anything, it can be considered as a noise of the rotating vacuum, being it perceived regardless of\nthe state of motion of the detector. This amounts to say that the inertial detector will also measure this noise, and\nwe normalize the rate in this situation by subtracting from it the value Eq.(32), resulting in a normalized excitation\nrate for the inertial detector in interaction with the field in the rotating vacuum:\n(i)\n\nRT (E, R0 ) = 2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\u221e\nX\n\nm=\u2212\u221e\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\ndq\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n2\ndk N22 Jm\n(qR0 ) \u00d7\n\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\nm\nm\n\u03b4 E \u2212 \u03c9\u03a9R0 \u2212\nsinh(2\u03a9R0 ) \u2212 (m\u03a9 \u2212 \u03c9) cosh(2\u03a9R0 ) \u2212 \u03b4 E \u2212\nsinh \u03a9R0 + \u03c9 cosh \u03a9R0 .\nR0\nR0\n\n(43)\n\nIt remains to be clarified the meaning of R0 in the excitation above. When studying the quantization in the rotating\nframe, one has to choose the world-line followed by the rotating observer, and this is parametrized by two quantities:\n7\n\n\fthe angular velocity \u03a9 and the distance R0 from the rotation axis. The vacuum state which appears in such a\nquantization is thus also indexed by these parameters and this is the origin of R0 in the above. A similar dependence\nof the excitation rate of a detector on a geometrical parameter appears, for instance, in the well-known Unruh-Davies\neffect: a uniformly accelerated detector interacting with the field in the Minkowski vacuum state will absorb particles\nin the same way as if it were inertial and interacting with the field in a thermal bath, with a temperature that depends\non the proper acceleration of the detector.\nIV. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS\n\nIn this work we quantize a massless scalar field in a uniformly rotating frame and compare this quantization with the\nusual one in an inertial frame. As a difference with regard to previous works, we assume a coordinate transformation\nbetween both frames that takes into account the finite velocity of light and is valid in the whole manifold. In doing\nso, a material point orbiting around the axis of rotation never exceeds the speed of light, no matter how far it is\nfrom the axis. The metric, when written in rotating coordinates, presents no event horizons, although it is non-static\nand non-stationary. We recourse to a criterium of di Sessa to define positive and negative frequency modes in the\nrotating frame and the field is quantized along these lines. Such a quantization entails a vacuum state and by using\nthe Bogolubov transformations we were able to show that this vacuum state is inequivalent to the Minkowski one.\nThis is the main result of the paper. This results in that the Minkowski vacuum is seen as a many-rotating-particle\nstate by a uniformly rotating observer, although it can not be seen as a thermal state (of Takeno particles), as in the\ncase of a uniformly accelerated observer (for Rindler particles) and thus we cannot assign a temperature to it.\nWe obtain the response function of an Unruh-De Witt detector in three different situations: the orbiting detector\nis interacting with the field prepared in the rotating and in the Minkowski vacuum states, and finally the detector\nis travelling in an inertial world-line and the field is prepared in the rotating vacuum. In the first case it is found\nthat the detector gets excited and we attributed this excitation to two different causes: Firstly, we are using the\nUnruh-De Witt detector model instead of a purely absorptive detector as the Glauber's model, and secondly the\nTrocheries-Takeno metric is non-static. Because the rotating vacuum excites even a rotating detector, we consider\nthis as a noise which will be measured by any other state of motion of the detector. In this way, when calculating the\nreponse of the inertial detector in the presence of the rotating vacuum we subtract from it this noise.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was partially suported by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u0131\u0301fico e Tecnol\u00f3gico (CNPq) of\nBrazil.\nV. APPENDIX\n\nWhat interests us here is the number of Trocheries-Takeno particles in a given state j = (q, m, k) that is present in\nthe Minkowski vacuum, given in terms of the Bogolubov coefficients [5]:\nX\nh0, M | a\u2020j aj |0, M i =\n(44)\n|\u03b2jj \u2032 |2 .\nj\u2032\n\nWe see that this is given by a sum of the squared modulus of the various coefficients. If we can show that at least\none of these coefficients is non-null, so we prove that there is a non-vanishing content of Trocheries-Takeno particles\nin the Minkowski vacuum.\nWe now give an indirect proof that the Bogolubov coefficient \u03b2 is in fact non-zero.

So, if we prove that it is different\nfrom zero, we prove that \u03b201 6= 0, since the second integral is not sufficient to make it zero. Let us call it I(\u03c9 \u2032 ):\nZ \u221e\nJ0 (qr)J1 (q \u2032 r)\nI(\u03c9 \u2032 ) = \u03c9 \u2032\nrdr\n[exp (2\u03c0ir\u03c9 sinh 2\u03a9r) \u2212 1] .\n(55)\n(1 + r\u03c9 sinh 2\u03a9r)\n0\nIt is possible to separate I(\u03c9 \u2032 ) in its real and imaginary parts and, using the same reasoning as for Eq.(50), we can\nconcentrate in the second integral above, which we call I1 (\u03c9 \u2032 ):\nZ \u221e\nJ0 (qr)J1 (q \u2032 r)\n\u2032\n\u2032\n.\n(56)\nI1 (\u03c9 ) = \u2212\u03c9\nrdr\n(1 + r\u03c9 sinh 2\u03a9r)\n0\nThere is not an analytical expression for I1 (\u03c9 \u2032 ), but using the Maple one can calculate particular values, such as:\nZ \u221e\nJ0 (r)J1 (r)\n= 0.183096;\n(57)\nrdr\n(1\n+ r sinh r)\n0\nso we proved, very indirectly, that \u03b2 6= 0.\n\n9\n\n\f[1] M.
