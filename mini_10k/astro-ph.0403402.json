During the\noutburst, it brightened by 6 magnitudes in the optical and after 15 months it had returned\nto its quiescent magnitude of mV = 18.3 mag. Spectroscopic observations during quiescence\nrevealed a K5 V\u2013K7 V stellar spectrum plus an emission line component from an accretion\ndisk surrounding the compact object (Oke 1977; Murdin et al., 1980). Further optical\nphotometric and spectroscopic studies established the orbital period at P = 0.323 d and\na secondary radial velocity semiamplitude of K2 = 457 km s\u22121 (McClintock & Remillard\n1986), which implied a mass function of f (M) = 3.18 \u00b1 0.16 M\u2299 and thus firm dynamical\nevidence for a massive compact object-a black hole-in this system. From measurements\nof the orbital inclination, the compact object mass was estimated at \u223c 11 M\u2299 and the\ncompanion star mass at \u223c 0.7 M\u2299 (Shahbaz et al., 1994; Gelino et al., 2001).\nMany aspects of the origin and evolution of low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) still\nremain unclear. It is believed that these systems begin as wide binaries with extreme mass\nratios and orbital separations of a \u223c 1000 R\u2299 (Portegies Zwart et al., 1997; Kalogera &\nWebbink 1998). After filling its Roche lobe, the massive star engulfs its low mass companion\nand the latter starts to spiraling in to the massive star's envelope (van den Heuvel & Habets\n1984; de Kool et al., 1987). A close binary forms if the spiral-in ceases before the low\nmass companion coalesces with the compact helium core of the primary. The helium core\ncontinues its evolution and after SN explosion may turn into a neutron star or a black hole.\nThe system becomes an X-ray binary once the secondary star fills its Roche lobe and begins\nto transfer matter to the compact object.\nThe spiral-in process could give rise to a naked He core, identified with Wolf\u2013Rayet\nstars that have lost their envelopes (Woosley et al., 1995). The high mass-loss rate (Chiosi\n& Maeder 1986; Nugis & Lamers 2000) of these stars makes difficult to understand the\nformation of compact objects as massive as the black hole in A0620\u221200 (Meynet & Maeder\n2003; Woosley et al., 1993). However, if the hydrogen envelope of the massive star is removed\nat the end of the He core burning phase (the so-called Case C mass transfer, Brown et al.,\n1999), the mass lost by wind in the short-lived (\u223c 104 yr) supergiant stage will not be large.\nConvection (Langer 1991) and rotation (Maeder & Meynet 2000; Heger et al., 2000)\ninfluence the structure and evolution of massive stars and subsequently the uncertainties in\nthe treatment of these parameters limit our understanding of the evolution of the progenitors\nof compact objects. In addition, uncertainties in various aspects of the supernova explosion\nmodels affect the predictions of the final remnant mass and the chemical composition of any\nejecta captured by the companion. Among the least known ingredients of these models, we\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nmay list:\n\u2022 The mass cut, i.e. the mass above which the matter is expelled at the time of the\nsupernova explosion and below which it remains locked into the compact remnant.\n\u2022 The amount of fallback or of the mass which is eventually accreted by the compact\ncore (Woosley & Weaver 1995; MacFadyen et al., 2001).\n\u2022 Possible mixing during the collapse phase (Herant & Woosley 1994; Herant et al., 1994;\nKifonidis et al., 2000; Fryer & Warren 2002).\n\u2022 The energy of the supernova explosion (Nakamura et al., 2001).\n\u2022 The symmetry of the supernova explosion (MacFadyen & Woosley 1999; Maeda et al.,\n2002).\nWith the aim of obtaining information on the link between compact objects and their\nprogenitor stars, Israelian et al. (1999) measured element abundances in the secondary star\nof the black hole binary Nova Scorpii 1994 (GRO J1655\u221240) and found several \u03b1-elements\n(O, Mg, Si, S, and Ti) enriched by a factor of 6\u201310. Since these elements cannot be produced in a low mass secondary star, this was interpreted as evidence of a supernova event\nthat originated the compact object. Taking into account the supernova yields from explosion models of massive stars, the relative abundances of these elements suggested that the\nsupernova progenitor was in the mass range 25\u201340 M\u2299 . Afterwards, these over-abundances\nwere compared with a variety of supernova models, including standard as well as hypernova\nmodels (for various helium star masses, explosion energies, and explosion geometries) and a\nsimple model of the evolution of the binary and the pollution of the secondary (Brown et\nal., 2000; Podsiadlowski et al., 2002). Additional independent evidence for the existence of\na supernova event in this system has also been found by Mirabel et al. (2002).\nIn this paper we analyze the chemical abundances of the secondary star in the LMXB\nA0620\u221200 with the aim of searching for any evidence of nucleosynthetic products from the\nprogenitor of the compact object.\n\n2.\n2.1.\n\nObservations\nStellar Spectrum\n\nThe secondary star was observed with the UV\u2013Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES) at\nthe Very Large Telescope (VLT) of the European Southern Observatory (Paranal), using a\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nconfiguration that provided a dispersion 0.029 \u00c5/pixel in the blue arm (4800\u20135800 \u00c5) and\n0.035 \u00c5/pixel in the red (5800\u20136800 \u00c5). Short exposures (480\u2013540 s) were chosen in order to\navoid as far as possible the smearing of spectral lines associated with radial velocity change\nduring its orbital motion. Twenty spectra were obtained during three nights in December\n2000 in both the blue and the red spectral regions.\nEvery spectrum was reduced within the MIDAS UVES environment. First, bias and\ninter-order backgrounds were subtracted from both the science and flat-field frames. The\nspectrum of the target was then optimally extracted and divided by the flat-field (extracted\nwith the same weighted profile as the star). The final spectra were wavelength-calibrated,\nevery order was extracted, and all were merged in order to obtain a one dimensional spectrum\nfor each spectrum.\n\nNORMALIZED FLUX\n\n2.0\n\nA0620-00\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\nH\u03b2\n\nH\u03b1\n\n5000\n\n5500\n\n\u03bb (ANGSTROMS)\n\n6000\n\nLiI\n\n6500\n\nNORMALIZED FLUX\n\n2.0\n\nTemplate star: HD209100 (K3V-K4.5V)\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\nLiI\n0.5\n5000\n\n5500\n\n\u03bb (ANGSTROMS)\n\n6000\n\n6500\n\nFig. 1.- Observed spectrum of the secondary star of A0620\u221200 (top) and of a properly\nbroadened template (HD209100, bottom).\nThe radial velocity for each spectrum has been obtained from the ephemeris reported\nin Casares et al. (2004, in preparation). The individual spectra were corrected from radial velocity and combined in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. After binning in\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nwavelength in groups of 10 pixels the final spectrum had a signal-to-noise ratio of 85 in the\ncontinuum. This spectrum is shown in Fig. 1.\n\n2.2.\n\nTelluric Spectrum\n\nWe obtained a telluric spectrum from our own observations and the stellar spectrum was\nproperly corrected for it. The large difference in broadening between the stellar (\u223c 95 kms\u22121 )\nand telluric lines (\u223c 9 km s\u22121 , the instrumental resolution), allowed us to fit a cubic spline\nto the stellar features in the binned spectrum of the star, i.e., the final spectrum displayed\nin Fig. 1. This fit was sampled to the original dispersion provided by the spectrograph and\nsubtracted from each of the 20 individual unbinned spectra taking into account the radial\nvelocity of the star in each case. We used this dispersion to ensure that the telluric lines\nwould not be smoothed. We obtained 20 residual spectra in which we subtracted the stellar\nfeatures, and which hence contain only telluric and interstellar medium (ISM) features. The\ncombination of these residual spectra gave a noisy telluric spectrum (spectrum 1) which was\ncross-correlated with another telluric spectrum (spectrum 2) obtained from a fast rotating\nstar. The correlation function of both spectra was centered on zero velocity.\nIn order to correct our target observations, we used the much higher S/N telluric spectrum 2 scaled down (with the IRAF1 task telluric) to the strength of the telluric lines\nin spectrum 1. This scaled telluric spectrum was shifted according to the radial velocity of\nthe target during each exposure. Then we combined all these shifted spectra to generate\na final telluric spectrum in the rest frame of the companion star (spectrum 3), which was\nsubtracted from the final spectrum of the target.\n1\n\nIRAF is distributed by National Optical Astronomy Observatory, which is operated by the Association\nof Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under contract with the National Science Foundation.\n\nTable 1.

Synthetic spectra are computed for solar abundances\n(dashed line) and best fit abundance (solid line).\n3.\n3.1.\n\nChemical Analysis\nStellar Parameters\n\nThe chemical analysis of secondary stars in LMXB systems is influenced by three important factors: veiling from the accretion disc, rotational broadening, and signal-to-noise ratio.\nThe last two are responsible for the uncertainty in the continuum position and hence affect\nthe normalization procedure. The veiling caused by the accretion disk in A0620\u221200 appears\nto drop from the near UV (\u223c30 %) to the red (\u223c6%) (Marsh et al., 1994; McClintock &\nRemillard 2000). However, Shahbaz et al. (1999) have determined that this veiling could be\nas high as 25% in the IR (K band). All these results depend on the set of templates used, so\nwe decided to attempt an independent determination of the veiling. In our analysis we have\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\ntried to obtain the veiling, together with the stellar atmospheric parameters, using synthetic\nspectral fits to the high resolution spectrum of the secondary star in A0620\u221200.\nFirst, moderately strong and relatively unblended lines of several elements of interest\nwere identified in the high resolution solar flux atlas of Kurucz et al. (1984). We selected\nseveral spectral features containing in total 24 absorption lines of Fe i with excitation potentials between 0.5 and 4.5 eV. In order to compute synthetic spectra for these features,\nwe adopted the atomic line data from the Vienna Atomic Line Database and used a grid of\nlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) models of atmospheres provided by Kurucz (1992,\nprivate communication). These models are interpolated for given values of Teff , log g, and\n[Fe/H]. Synthetic spectra were then computed using the LTE code MOOG (Sneden 1973).\nTo minimize the effects associated with the errors in the transition probabilities of atomic\nlines, we adjusted the oscillator strengths, log gf values of the selected lines until we succeeded in reproducing the solar atlas of Kurucz et al. (1984) with solar abundances (Anders\n& Grevesse 1989).\nWe generated a grid of synthetic spectra for these features in terms of five free parameters\nthree to characterize the star atmospheric model (effective temperature, Teff , surface gravity,\nlog g, and metallicity, [Fe/H]) and two further parameters to take into account the effect of\nthe accretion disk emission in the stellar spectrum. This veiling was defined as the ratio of\nthe accretion disk flux to the stellar continuum flux, Fdisc /Fcont,star . It was assumed to be a\nlinear function of wavelength and is thus characterized by two parameters: veiling at 4500 \u00c5,\n4500\n4500\nf4500 = Fdisc\n/Fcont,star\n, and the slope, m0 . These five parameters were changed according to\nthe steps and ranges given in Table 1. Note that the steps for the veiling slope were chosen to\ncover all possible combinations of veiling at different wavelengths taking into account the step\non f4500 . A rotational broadening of 95 km s\u22121 and a limb-darkening \u01eb = 0.65 were assumed\nbased on Casares et al. (2004, in preparation), and a fixed value for the microturbulence,\n\u03be = 1 km s\u22121 was adopted.\nThe observed spectrum was compared with each of the 800 000 synthetic spectra in the\ngrid via a \u03c72 minimization procedure that provided the best model fit. Using a bootstrap\nMonte-Carlo method we defined the 1\u03c3 confidence regions for the five free parameters and\nestablished as most likely values: Teff = 4900 \u00b1 100 K, log g = 4.2 \u00b1 0.3, [Fe/H]= 0.25 \u00b1 0.1,\nf4500 = 0.30 \u00b1 0.05, and m0 = \u22120.00014 \u00b1 0.00002.\nConfidence regions were determined using 1000 realizations. The corresponding histograms are shown in Fig. 2. Our optical veiling determinations are consistent with previous\nvalues in the literature for this system (Marsh et al., 1994). These authors found a veiling\nof 17 \u00b1 3 per cent at H\u03b2 and 6 \u00b1 3% at H\u03b1, while we have obtained (using their definition\nfor veiling), 20 \u00b1 5 per cent and 0 \u00b1 5 per cent, respectively.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n3.2.\n\nStellar Abundances\n\nUsing the derived stellar parameters we analyzed several spectral regions where we had\nidentified various lines of Fe, Ca, Al, Ti, Ni, and Li. Although the lines of these elements\nwere usually the main contributor to the features, in some cases, they were blended, mainly\nwith Fe. The inaccuracy in the location of the continuum caused by the blends of many weak\nrotationally broadened stellar lines was one of the main sources of error in the abundance\ndeterminations. Therefore, each of these spectral regions was carefully normalized using a\nlate type star template (HD 209100) for comparison.\nWe determined the abundances of these elements using spectral synthesis. By comparing\nthe observed spectrum with a grid of synthetic spectra we identified the best fit abundance\nfor each element through a \u03c72 minimization procedure. For these spectral syntheses we\nmodified element abundances while stellar parameters and the suitable veiling factor for\neach spectral region were kept fixed. A preliminary estimate of Fe abundance was obtained\nin the procedure described above. We then performed a more detailed analysis of the seven\nFe dominated spectral features but now taking into account the contribution of much weaker\nlines to the blends. We obtained an average Fe abundance of [Fe/H] = 0.14 \u00b1 0.12, where the\nerror is estimated from the dispersion of the abundances inferred from each feature. A new\nmodel with this metallicity was generated in order to perform a detailed spectral synthesis\nfor all the features under consideration.\nAbundances for all the elements are listed in Table 2 and referred to the solar values\nadopted from Anders & Grevesse (1989). We also give errors, estimated from the dispersion\nof the elemental abundances, \u2206\u03c3 , obtained from the best fits to the various features. We\nhave verified that the major source for these errors is the inaccuracy in the location of\nthe continuum caused by the signal-to-noise ratio and the large rotational broadening of\nthe lines. Errors associated with uncertainties in effective temperature, \u2206Teff , and gravity,\n\u2206log g, are also listed in Table 2. The error in the abundance caused by uncertainty in the\ndetermination of the veiling is about 0.05 dex for all the elements. We have listed in Table\n2 the total error, \u2206TOTAL , which takes into account all these sources of uncertainty.\nIn Fig. 3 we show several Fe spectral features where we can see the best model synthesis\nin comparison with the synthesis using solar abundances. We also analyzed the spectrum\nof a template late type star, HD 209100, which was broadened using the rotational profile\ndetermined from the spectrum of A0620\u221200. In the comparison star, the abundances of all\nthe elements studied are close to solar except the Li abundance, which is severely depleted.\nCa and Ni abundances were derived from features where the contribution of these elements was dominant with little blending from other elements, mostly Fe lines.

The spectrum of the template is not corrected for telluric\nlines (atm. H2 O); therefore, these lines appear broadened in the spectrum (histogram line)\nand the synthetic spectrum does not fit (solid line).\nratios ([E/Fe]) takes into account how individual element abundances depend on the various\nsources of uncertainty. As can be seen in Table 2, the uncertainties induced by effective\ntemperature and gravity are considerably diminished when dealing with abundance ratios\nand the major source of error in [E/Fe] is associated with the dispersion, \u2206\u03c3 , of abundances\nobtained from different features of the same element. The [Ca/Fe] ratio of the secondary is\nconsistent with abundances of stars with similar iron content, while Ni and Ti appear to be\nmoderately enhanced. Al is clearly over-abundant if we take into account the low dispersion\nof Al abundances in these stars. In Table 3 we show the element abundance ratios in the\nsecondary star in A0620\u221200 and these average values in stars with iron content in the range\n\u22120.06 < [Fe/H] < 0.34, the comparison sample, corresponding to a 1\u03c3 uncertainty in the\niron abundance of the companion star. Whereas Ca is consistent with the average values of\nthe comparison sample, Ni, Ti and especially Al are 1\u03c3 more over-abundant than the average\nvalues of the stars in the comparison sample.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n\nNORMALIZED FLUX\n\n1.00\n0.95\n0.90\n0.85\n\nTemplate star: HD209100 (K3V-K4.5V)\n\n0.80\n0.75\n6690\n\n6700\n\n6710\n\u03bb (ANGSTROMS)\n\n6720\n\n6730\n\nA0620-00\nNORMALIZED FLUX\n\n1.00\n0.95\n0.90\n0.85\n0.80\n0.75\n6690\n\nAlI\n\nAlI\n\nFeI\n\n6700\n\nLiI\n\n6710\n\u03bb (ANGSTROMS)\n\nFeI FeI TiICaI\n\nSiI\n\n6720\n\nFeI\n\n6730\n\nFig. 7.- The same as in Fig. 3.\nWe will discuss these results in the framework of possible evolutionary scenarios of the\nA0620\u221200 system.\n\n4.1.1. Evolutionary scenario\nThe evolutionary scenario proposed by de Kool et al. (1987) starts with a massive star\n(M1 \u223c 40 M\u2299 ) and a companion of roughly M2 \u223c 1 M\u2299 . Spiral-in of the secondary during\nthe red supergiant phase leads to the ejection of the hydrogen-rich envelope and produces\na short period helium star binary. In order to be able to reproduce the high mass (\u223c 10\nM\u2299 ) of the compact object in A0620\u221200 we should consider the so-called Case C for mass\ntransfer in which the massive star does not lose its envelope before finishing its He core\nburning (Brown et al., 1999). The mass, MHe , and radius, RHe , of the helium core of the\nprogenitor can be computed using the expressions given by Portegies Zwart et al. (1997,\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n\nTable 2.

Here,\nwe will consider that the atmosphere of the secondary star is only polluted by the ejecta\nin the supernova explosion of the helium core. In this case, what kind of anomalies can we\nexpect to find at the surface of the secondary?\nAn important quantity in this discussion is the mass of the compact object. Gelino et\nal. (2001) have recently reported an estimated mass of 11 \u00b1 1.9 M\u2299 for the compact object\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nin A0620\u221200; hence the final remnant mass in supernova model should be roughly 10 M\u2299 .\nThe mass cuts in supernovae or even the more energetic hypernovae give rise to compact\nobjects whose masses are not high enough to explain the high mass black hole in A0620\u221200\n(Nakamura et al., 2001; Woosley & Weaver 1995). Therefore, the final mass of the compact\nobject had to be generated either from a prompt and direct collapse (collapsar Type I) or,\nin a mild explosion with fall-back (collapsar Type II, MacFadyen et al., 2001). In the latter\ncase, up to \u223c 5 M\u2299 may fall back onto the collapsed remnant, turning it into a black\nhole. This makes it quite difficult that a significant mass fraction of iron could have escaped\nfrom the collapsing matter in the supernova event because iron is formed in the inner layers\nof the star. Israelian et al. (1999) found in Nova Scorpii 94 that while \u03b1-elements were\nenhanced Fe was not, in spite of the lower mass of the compact object (5.4 \u00b1 0.3 M\u2299 , Beer\n& Podsiadlowski 2002) as compared with that in A0620\u221200. Thus, the supernova may not\neject any iron, and it therefore seems quite plausible that the slightly higher than solar Fe\nabundance of the secondary star in A0620\u221200 reflects its primordial value. However, mixing\nof ejected material may be induced by Rayleigh\u2013Taylor instabilities (Kifonidis et al., 2000);\nhence heavy elements such as 56 Ni may be conveyed to the outer layers in the explosion.\nOn the other hand, the orbital separation between the compact object and the secondary\nhas been estimated to be ac = 4.47 \u00b1 0.27 R\u2299 (Gelino et al., 2001). We can relate the\npost-supernova orbital parameters with the pre-SN parameters assuming an initially circular\norbit and instantaneous spherically symmetric ejection (that is, in a time interval shorter\nthan the orbital period). These relations are given by van den Heuvel & Habets (1984):\na0 = ac \u03bcf where a0 and ac are the orbital separation just before the supernova and after tidal\ncircularization of the post-SN eccentric orbit, respectively, and \u03bcf = (MBH +M2 )/(MHe +M2 )\nwhere MBH is the compact remnant mass. Adopting the already mentioned values (MBH \u223c\n10 M\u2299 , MHe \u223c 14 M\u2299 and M2 \u223c 1 M\u2299 ), we find a0 \u223c 3.3 R\u2299 . This distance is important\nsince we assume that the secondary star was outside the He core (RHe \u223c 2.7 R\u2299 ) of the\nprimary before the SN explosion. Therefore, we can estimate the amount of the ejected\nmaterial in a spherical explosion that could be captured by the companion as though coming\nfrom a central point. The explosion of a star as massive as the primary would have taken\nplace only \u223c 5 \u00d7 106 yr after the formation of the system (Brunish & Truran 1982). At that\ntime, the radius of a 1 M\u2299 secondary star would be \u223c 1.3 R\u2299 (D'Antona & Mazzitelli\n1994). If we consider a spherically symmetric supernova explosion, taking into account the\nfraction of solid the angle subtended by the companion and assuming a capture efficiency,\nfcapture , of 1 (i.e., all the matter ejected within that solid angle is captured), the amount of\nmass deposited on the secondary would have been\nmadd = \u2206M(\u03c0R22 /4\u03c0a20 )fcapture \u223c 0.15 M\u2299 ,\nwhere \u2206M = MHe \u2212 MBH \u223c 4 M\u2299 is the total ejected mass. This amount of ejected mass\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nis sufficient to explain the radial velocity of the system which is a lower limit to its runaway\nvelocity (Nelemans et al., 1999).\nIn Tables 4 and 5 we present the expected abundances in the atmosphere of the secondary\nstar after contamination from the progenitor of the compact object according to the above\nmentioned assumptions. In Table 4 we have considered two plausible masses (1 M\u2299 and 0.8\nM\u2299 ) for the secondary star at the time of the explosion of the primary and a capture efficiency\nfactor of 1, which means that all the matter ejected within the solid angle subtended by the\ncompanion is captured. In Table 5 we have fixed the secondary mass at 0.8 M\u2299 and we have\nconsidered two other efficiency factors of 0.5 and 0.1, which means that 50 and 10 per cent\nof the ejected mass within that solid angle is captured. We have used a 40 M\u2299 spherically\nsymmetric core-collapse explosion model (MHe \u223c 14 M\u2299 ) for two different explosion energies\nfrom Umeda & Nomoto (2002 and 2003, private communication). That energy is deposited\ninstantaneously in the central region of the progenitor core to generate a strong shock wave.\nThe subsequent propagation of the shock wave is followed through a hydrodynamic code\n(Umeda & Nomoto, 2002, and references therein). In our simple model, we have assumed\ndifferent mass cuts, fall-back masses and a mixing factor2 that take into account the amount\nof fall-back matter mixed with the ejecta. We have adopted a mixing factor of 1 (i.e., all\nthe fall-back material is well mixed with the ejecta). The amount of fall-back, Mfallback , is\nthe difference between the final remnant mass, MBH , and the initial remnant mass, Mcut . In\nmodels with Mcut \u2264 10 M\u2299 , the final remnant mass is equal to 10 M\u2299 and hence the total\nejected mass is 4 M\u2299 . Nevertheless, models with Mcut > 10 M\u2299 assume MBH = Mcut and do\nnot include either fall-back or mixing. In such models, the total ejected mass, \u2206M, is the\ndiference between the final remnant mass and the helium core mass.\nAt the time of the explosion, the secondary was close enough to the He core (a0 \u223c 3.3\nR\u2299 ) for the amount of matter that could have been accreted from the H-He enriched envelope\nafter explosion to be negligible, so we do not expect a significant change in the He/H ratio in\nthe secondary atmosphere. The hydrogen mass in the He core was \u223c 10\u221216 M\u2299 ; therefore,\nwe can estimate the number density of an element E in the secondary atmosphere as:\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\nN(E)\u22c6 + N(E)add\n=\n=\nN(H)\u22c6\n\u22c6,f\n\u0014\n\u0015\nX(E)\u22c6 [E/H]\u2020,i X(E)add madd mH\n10\n+\n,\nX(H)\u22c6\nX(H)\u22c6 mconv mE\n2\n\nN(E)\nN(H)\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0014\n\nOther detailed explosion models have been considered in the analysis of over-abundances of the secondary\nstar in Nova Sco 94 by Podsiadlowski et al.

However, the capture efficiency, fcapture , is lower than 1.

The mass of the convective zone was fixed\nat mconv = 0.652 and 0.667 M\u2299 from the evolutionary tracks for a 1 and 0.8 M\u2299 secondary\nstars, respectively, with an age of \u223c 5 \u00d7 106 yr (D'Antona & Mazzitelli 1994).\nThe original element mass fractions in the secondary star were assumed to be solar\nfrom Anders & Grevesse (1989) and we have also considered an explosion model from a solar\nmetallicity progenitor. However, in order to take into account that the initial iron content\nof the star was probably higher than solar ([Fe/H]\u2020,i = 0.14) we scaled up the expected\nabundances with [E/H]\u2020,i which is the average element abundance in the comparison sample\nusing data shown in Fig. 8 (see Table 3). Expected abundances shown in Table 4 and 5 were\ncalculated using the following formula:\n\n[E/H]\u22c6,f\n\n\u0014\n\nN(E)\n= log\nN(H)\n\n\u0015\n\n\u22c6,f\n\n\u0014\n\nN(E)\n\u2212 log\nN(H)\n\n\u0015\n\n\u2299\n\nIt is clearly seen that only models with mass cuts as high as 11 M\u2299 can fit the abundances of the secondary star within the error bars. In models with lower mass cuts, the\namount of Al in the ejecta is too high in comparison with the other heavy elements analyzed. Even under strong assumptions such as large amounts of fall-back matter, Mfallback ,\nand/or mixing efficiency fixed at 1, it is not possible to get good fits to the observed abundance values for mass cuts below 11\u201312 M\u2299 depending on the capture efficiency assumed.\nThis is independent of the explosion energy, \u03b5, since this parameter has little influence on\nthe Al yield at any mass cut. It does not depend on the mass of the secondary. In summary,\nthe moderate over-abundances of Ti, Ni, and especially Al could be explained if there were\nan explosion event of a star of initial mass \u223c 40 M\u2299 with a helium core of \u223c 14 M\u2299 that\nled to the formation of a black hole with a mass of approximately 11\u201312.5 M\u2299 . As in the\ncase of Nova Sco 94 (Israelian et al., 1999), we find signatures in the secondary of A0620\u221200\nthat suggest the formation of the black hole as a consequence of an explosive event.\nHowever, as we have already mentioned in \u00a71, many uncertainties still remain in supernova explosion models and in the evolution of LMXBs. For instance, a capture efficiency as\nhigh as 1 may not be adequate since simulations of type Ia SNe suggest that the supernova\nblast wave may induce mass-loss in the secondary instead of matter accretion (Marietta et\nal., 2000). On the other hand, the assumption of spherical symmetry is not generally expected for hypernova or collapsar models, in particular those associated with gamma-ray\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.4 MSUN\n\n3\n\nlog \u03b5(Li)\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n5500\n\n5000\n\n4500\nTEFF (K)\n\n4000\n\n3500\n\nFig. 9.- Li abundance of the secondary star in A0620\u221200 (filled circle) in comparison with\nthe abundances of different rotating Pleiades dwarf stars versus effective temperature from\nGarc\u0131\u0301a L\u00f3pez et al.

(2002) have studied nucleosynthesis\nin aspherical explosions and found that the chemical composition of the ejecta is strongly\ndependent on direction. In particular, Fe is mainly ejected in the polar direction, whereas\nO and other alpha-elements (e.g. Si, S, Mg) are preferentially ejected near the equatorial\nplane. Therefore, it would be interesting to analyze other elements such as O, Mg, and C,\nwhich are enhanced in many of the model computations in Table 4 and 5, even at high mass\ncuts. We note that Orosz et al. (2001) have also found overabundances (by a factor 2\u201310\nwith respect to solar) of some of these elements in the secondary star of the LMXB system\nJ1819.3\u22122525 (V4641 Sgr).\n\n4.2.\n\nLi abundance\n\nThe abundance of lithium in the secondary star in A0620\u221200 is substantially higher than\nin field main sequence stars of the same mass (\u223c 0.7 M\u2299 ) but similar to that of Pleiades stars\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\n\n0.8\nMASS TRANSFER RATE\n\n1*10-10MSUN/yr\n3*10-10MSUN/yr\n5*10-10MSUN/yr\n9*10-10MSUN/yr\n\nAGE (109yr)\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n0.60\n\n0.70\n\n0.80\nSECONDARY MASS (MSUN)\n\n0.90\n\n1.00\n\nFig. 10.- Upper limit to the age of the A0620\u221200 system according to the Li abundance\nof the secondary star versus stellar masses of the secondary star, assuming different mass\ntransfer rates. Stellar masses have been assigned according to the evolutionary tracks of\nD'Antona & Mazzitelli (1994) for 108 yr.\nof comparable mass and rotational velocity (see Fig. 9). Convective mixing during pre-main\nsequence and main sequence evolution is expected to produce significant lithium depletion in\nthe atmospheres of such stars, thus a possible explanation for the Li over-abundance in the\nsecondary is that the A0620\u221200 system is as young as the Pleiades cluster(i.e., \u223c 7\u201315 \u00d7107\nyr). This appears to be in conflict with the evolutionary scenario proposed by de Kool et al.\n(1987), where an age of a few times 109 yr is assumed. However, Naylor & Podsiadlowski\n(1993) have argued, based on the galactic distribution of LMXBs, that these systems are\nassociated with the Galactic disk, and probably have an age of only 107 to 108 yr. If the\nlifetime were this short, the mass loss from the companion would not have been relevant since\nthe present mass transfer rate is \u1e402 \u223c 10\u221210 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (McClintock et al., 1995) although it\nmay not necessarily be stable in the course of the whole binary lifetime (\u1e402 \u223c 10\u22129 \u201310\u221210\nM\u2299 yr\u22121 , Ergma & Fedorova 1998).\nIt is possible to constrain the age of the system using the current Li abundance and\nplausible mass transfer rates. Let us assume in what follows that there is no mechanism\nable to enrich the atmosphere of the secondary star with freshly synthesized Li nuclei.

Superimposed to them\nwere displayed different spectral synthesis, fixed Li abundance, for 7 Li/6 Li = 2 (dashed line\nin top panel) and for 7 Li/6 Li = 5 (dashed line in bottom panel).\nthe initial mass of the secondary star were smaller than 1 M\u2299 Li could survive only in the\nouter layers, i.e., above the bottom of the convective zone. In a solar type star, the mass\nof the convective zone is 0.03 M\u2299 , and, given the range of plausible mass transfer rates for\nthe secondary, such a mass would be transferred to the compact object in less than 0.3 Gyr,\nleaving the atmosphere of the secondary completely free of Li nuclei, which we see cannot be\nthe case. In Fig. 10 we show how this simple argument constrains the age of the system for\ndifferent mass transfer rates and initial secondary masses. In summary, the more massive\nthe secondary star and the higher the mass transfer rate are, the stringent the upper limit to\nthe age of the system that can be imposed. The curves in Fig. 10, in fact, give conservative\nupper limits to the age, in particular for the lower mass range, since we have not taken into\naccount that some Li depletion caused by convective mixing may also have occurred. We\nnote that we have not considered values for the initial mass of the secondary above 1 M\u2299\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\nbecause under the mass transfer rates considered such stars cannot lead to an object of the\npresent mass and preserve the required amount of Li.\nHigh Li abundances have been noticed by Mart\u0131\u0301n et al. (1994) in other LMXBs such as\nCen X-4 and V404 Cyg. These authors suggested as an alternative explanation of youth the\nexistence of a production mechanism of lithium. Either early in the evolution of the system\nduring the supernova explosion of the primary progenitor; or a continuing process such as \u03b1\u2013\n\u03b1 reactions during the repeated strong outbursts that characterize transient X-ray binaries.\nIf, indeed, fresh Li is synthesized and trapped in the atmosphere, the above arguments to\nconstrain the age cannot hold. It is thus, very important to find a way of disentangling\nthe origin of the high Li abundances observed. The spallation mechanism would produce\nconsiderable amounts of the 6 Li isotope with isotopic ratios as low as 7 Li/6 Li = 5. However,\ntrials using a 7 Li/6 Li isotopic ratio of 5 and 2 were performed (see Fig. 11), but they gave\na slightly worse numerical fit to the observed spectrum than the case of pure 7 Li. Higher\nS/N spectroscopic observations will be needed to test the spallation scenario. Recently, Li\nhas been detected in the companion of the millisecond pulsar J1740\u22125340 in the globular\ncluster NGC 6397 (Sabbi et al. 2003). The secondary is a turn-off star which has lost most\nof its mass and thus most of its initial lithium content. The high Li abundance measured in\nthis star suggests that actually some Li production may take place in these systems.\n\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have obtained a high quality spectrum of the secondary star in A0620\u221200 and\nderived atmospheric chemical abundances. We have set up a technique that provides a\ndetermination of the stellar parameters taking into account any possible veiling from the\naccretion disk. We find Teff = 4900 \u00b1 150 K, log g = 4.2 \u00b1 0.3, and a veiling (defined as\nFdisk /Fcont,star ) of less than 15 per cent at 5000 \u00c5 and decreasing towards longer wavelengths.\nAssuming a mass for the secondary of M2 = 0.68 \u00b1 0.18 M\u2299 , the estimated surface gravity\nleads to a stellar radius of R2 = 1.1 \u00b1 0.4 R\u2299 , consistent with the size of the Roche lobe for\nthe secondary given by Gelino et al. (2001).\nThe abundances of Fe, Ca, Ti, Al, and Ni are slightly higher than solar. The abundance\nratios of each element with respect to Fe were compared with these ratios in late-type main\nsequence metal-rich stars. Moderate anomalies for Ti, Ni, and especially Al have been\nfound. A comparison with element yields from spherically symmetric supernova explosion\nmodels suggests that the secondary star captured part of the ejecta from a supernova that\nalso originated the compact object in A0620\u221200. The abundances can be explained if a\nprogenitor with a \u223c 14 M\u2299 helium core exploded with a mass cut in the range 11\u201312.5 M\u2299 ,\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\nsuch that no significant amount of iron could escape from the collapse of the inner layers.\nElements such as O, Mg, Si, S, and C, with unavailable transitions in our spectrum, will be\nstudied to confirm this scenario.\nThe Li abundance in the secondary star in A0620\u221200 is dramatically enhanced in comparison with field late-type main sequence stars, possibly indicating either that this is a\nyoung system (\u223c 0.5\u20132 \u00d7 108 yr), or the existence of a Li production-preservation mechanism, such as the \u03b1\u2013\u03b1 reactions, which have to be tested analyzing the 7 Li/6 Li isotopic ratio\nusing future higher S/N optical spectroscopic observations.\n\n6.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe are grateful to Hideyuki Umeda and Ken'ichi Nomoto for sending us their explosion\nmodels and several programs for our model computations, and for helpful discussions.
