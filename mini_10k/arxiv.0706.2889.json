The solar wind conditions at one astronomical unit (AU) can be strongly\ndisturbed by the interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). A subset, called magnetic\nclouds (MCs), is formed by twisted flux ropes that transport an important amount of\nmagnetic flux and helicity which is released in CMEs. At 1 AU from the Sun, the magnetic\nstructure of MCs is generally modeled neglecting their expansion during the spacecraft\ncrossing. However, in some cases, MCs present a significant expansion. We present here\nan analysis of the huge and significantly expanding MC observed by the Wind spacecraft\nduring 9 and 10 November, 2004. This MC was embedded in an ICME. After determining\nan approximated orientation for the flux rope using the minimum variance method, we\nprecise the orientation of the cloud axis relating its front and rear magnetic discontinuities\nusing a direct method. This method takes into account the conservation of the azimuthal\nmagnetic flux between the in- and out-bound branches, and is valid for a finite impact\nparameter (i.e., not necessarily a small distance between the spacecraft trajectory and\nthe cloud axis). The MC is also studied using dynamic models with isotropic expansion.\nWe have found (6.2 \u00b1 1.5) \u00d7 1020 Mx for the axial flux, and (78 \u00b1 18) \u00d7 1020 Mx for the\nazimuthal flux. Moreover, using the direct method, we find that the ICME is formed by\na flux rope (MC) followed by an extended coherent magnetic region. These observations\nare interpreted considering the existence of a previous larger flux rope, which partially\nreconnected with its environment in the front. We estimate that the reconnection process\nstarted close to the Sun. These findings imply that the ejected flux rope is progressively\npeeled by reconnection and transformed to the observed ICME (with a remnant flux rope\nin the front part).\nKeywords: Coronal Mass Ejections, Interplanetary; Magnetic fields, Interplanetary; Magnetic Reconnection, Observational Signatures; Solar Wind, Disturbances\n\n1. Introduction\nA magnetic configuration, previously in equilibrium in the solar atmosphere,\ncan reach a global instability threshold when the magnetic stress becomes\ntoo high. In this case, the plasma is ejected into the interplanetary (IP)\nmedium and is observed as a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) by the solar\ncoronagraphs. This magnetized mass, which can be expelled as fast as few\ntimes 1000 km/s, is recognized in the IP space as an interplanetary CME,\nc 2018 Springer Science + Business Media. Printed in the USA.\n\ndassoetal.tex; 6/11/2018; 5:56; p.1\n\n\f2\n\nDasso et al.\n\nICME, see e.g., Wimmer-Schweingruber et al. (2006). During its travel from\nthe Sun to 1 AU, fast CMEs are slowed down due to drag forces between the\nICME and the solar wind environment (see, e.g., Vr\u0161nak and Gopalswamy,\n2002). Thus, at 1 AU they can reach speeds as high as \u223c 1000 km/s.\n1.1. Magnetic Clouds\nMagnetic clouds (MCs) are a particular subset of ICMEs. They are formed\nby twisted magnetic flux tubes that carry a large amount of magnetic helicity\nfrom the Sun to the IP medium. They also transport significant amounts of\nmagnetic flux, mass, and energy. The principal characteristics of these magnetic structures are: (i) an enhanced magnetic field, (ii) a smooth rotation\nof the magnetic field vector through a large angle (\u2248 1800 ), and (iii) a low\nproton temperature (Klein and Burlaga, 1982).\nThe magnetic field in MCs is relatively well modeled by the so-called\nLundquist's model (Lundquist, 1950), which considers a static and axiallysymmetric linear force-free magnetic configuration (e.g., Goldstein, 1983;\nBurlaga, 1988; Lepping et al., 1990; Burlaga, 1995; Lynch et al., 2003).\nHowever, many other different models have been also used to describe the\nmagnetic structure of MCs.\nSome models consider the MC as a rigid body during the time it travels\nthrough the solar wind and crosses the spacecraft. Farrugia et al. (1999)\nconsidered a cylindrical shape for the cloud cross-section and a non-linear\nforce-free field; while Mulligan et al. (1999), Hidalgo et al. (2002), and\nCid et al. (2002) considered a cylindrical cloud but a non-force free field.\nNon cylindrical static models have been also applied to MCs (e.g., Hu and\nSonnerup, 2001, Vandas and Romashets, 2002). A comparison of global\nquantities (magnetic fluxes and helicity) derived from different static models\nhas been done by Dasso et al. (2003) and Dasso et al. (2005b). Different techniques have been compared using synthetic data and analyzing the output\nof numerical simulations of MCs (Riley et al., 2004).\nSome MCs present a significantly larger velocity in their front than in\ntheir back, a characteristic of expansion. Thus, some authors have used\ndynamical models to describe these clouds during the observation time;\nthey have considered two cases: only with a radial expansion (see, e.g.,\nFarrugia et al., 1993, Osherovich et al., 1993, Farrugia et al., 1997, Nakwacki\net al., 2005), and with expansion in the radial and axial directions (see, e.g.,\nShimazu and Vandas, 2002, Berdichevsky et al., 2003). Some dynamical\nmodels consider an expanding elliptical shape for the MC (e.g., Hidalgo,\n2003). The main aim of these models is to take into account the evolution\nof the magnetic field as the spacecraft crosses the MC; then, to correct the\neffect of mixing spatial-variation/time-evolution in the observations to get\na better determination of the MC field (and related characteristics).\n\ndassoetal.tex; 6/11/2018; 5:56; p.2\n\n\fTransformation of a flux rope to an ICME\n\n3\n\n1.2. Aims of this study\nWe analyze the MC detected inside the ICME observed at L1 between\nNov. 9, 2004, at 20:25 UT and Nov. 11, 2004, at 18:45 UT (Harra et al.,\n2006). This is a very fast, left-handed and huge MC with a size larger than\n0.2 AU in the Earth-Sun direction. It has a very intense magnetic field\n(> 40 nT), and expands strongly, with a velocity of \u223c 850 km/s in its front\nand \u223c 600 \u2212 700 km/s in its back, depending on where the rear boundary is\nset. This MC presents one of the largest (ever observed) velocity differences\nbetween its front and its back (Nakwacki et al., 2007).\nWe analyze this MC using a model-independent method, called direct\nmethod (Dasso et al., 2006). It takes into account the magnetic flux conservation in closed structures, such as flux ropes. This method gives us an\nestimation of the magnetic flux in the MC directly from the data, and allows\nus to improve the determination of the orientation of the MC axis, as well\nas its boundaries. Finding the boundaries for some MCs is an open issue\n(Russell and Shinde, 2005; Wimmer-Schweingruber et al., 2006). Indeed,\nseveral authors, using different proxies, set them at different times with the\nconsequent differences in the estimated MC axial orientation and in the\nestimations of global magnetohydrodynamic quantities.\nIn Section 2, we describe the magnetic and plasma properties of the MC.\nThen, in Section 3, we present the direct method and the results obtained.\nIn Section 4, we fit the two dynamical models to velocity and magnetic field\nobservations. From the fitted models we compute the magnetic fluxes, and\ncompare them with the values obtained from the static Lundquist's model\nand from the direct method. Finally, in Section 5, we give a summary and\nour conclusions.\n\n2. The studied cloud\nIn this section we analyze in situ magnetic and plasma observations of the\nMC observed on Nov. 9-10, 2004, which is located inside an ICME. We define\na local frame of coordinates, attached to the MC, and we analyze the data\nin this frame.\n2.1. One or two clouds?\nAn ICME was observed from 20:25 UT on 9 Nov. to \u2248 18:45 UT on 11 Nov.\nThe ICME is preceded by a typical piled up solar wind material (panel np\nin Figure 1). This corresponds to plasma and magnetic field pushed from\nbehind by the ICME, forming the turbulent pre-ICME sheath (notice the\nhigh level of fluctuations in \u03b8B ). A forward shock is located in front of the\n\ndassoetal.tex; 6/11/2018; 5:56; p.3\n\n\f4\n\nDasso et al.\n\nsheath (at 9:15 UT of Nov. 9). This event presents also a non-typical second\nshock inside the sheath that precedes the ICME (at 18:20 UT of Nov. 9).\nFor a deeper description of shocks and their association with solar sources\nsee Harra et al. (2006), in particular their Table I.\nThe end of the ICME is marked by a thick solid line (Nov. 11, 18:45 UT,\nlabel \"end\" in Figure 1) as defined by Harra et al. (2006). After Nov. 11 at\n18:45 UT, the magnetic field is consistent with Parker's spiral (changes of\nmagnetic sectors are observed in \u03c6B ). The higher level of magnetic fluctuations, typical of the fast solar wind, confirms this interpretation.\nTwo MCs were initially reported inside this ICME: the first one starting\non Nov. 09, at 20:54 UT, and finishing on Nov. 10, at 03:24 UT, and the\nsecond one starting on Nov. 10, at 03:36 UT, and finishing on Nov. 10\nat 11:06 UT (http://lepmfi.gsfc.nasa.gov/mfi/mag cloud S1.html). The rotation of the field is indeed larger than usual (close to one\nturn, Figure 1). Moreover, the magnetic field observed has indeed a nonclassical structure: it is very strong in the front, progressively decreases in\nthe back and has an extended weak tail. Still, a coherent and continuous\nvariation of both the field strength and the plasma velocity is observed,\nwithout clear evidence of two independent magnetic structures.\nOther studies concluded that only one extended MC was present. In Harra\net al. (2006) and Longcope et al. (2007) the boundaries of the magnetic cloud\nwere selected as starting on Nov. 9, at 20:30 UT, and finishing on Nov. 10,\nat 10:00 UT. Similar boundaries (starting on Nov. 9, at 20:40 UT, and\nfinishing on Nov. 10, at 10:20 UT) were chosen by Qiu et al. (2007). Both\nthe direct method and data modeling confirm the presence of only one flux\nrope (Sections 3 and 4).\n2.2. Summary of the cloud observations\nWe analyze the in situ measurements of the magnetic field components\nobtained by the Magnetic Field Instrument (MFI, Lepping et al., 1995)\nand the plasma quantities obtained by the Solar Wind Experiment (SWE,\nOgilvie et al., 1995), both aboard Wind. There is a small data gap in SWE\nfrom Nov. 9, 21:58 UT to 22:27 UT (see Figure 1).\nThe magnetic field observations are in GSE (Geocentric Solar Ecliptic)\ncoordinates. In this right-handed system of coordinates, x\u0302GSE corresponds\nto the Earth-Sun direction, \u1e91GSE points to the North (perpendicular to the\necliptic plane) and \u0177GSE is in the ecliptic plane and points to the dusk when\nan observer is near Earth (thus, opposing to the planetary motion).\nThe front boundary of the MC (Nov. 9, at 20:30 UT) is well defined\n(vertical dashed line in Figure 1, label \"in\"). The magnetic field presents a\nNorth-West-South rotation with time (see \u03b8B and \u03c6B panels in Figure 1);\n\ndassoetal.tex; 6/11/2018; 5:56; p.4\n\n\f5\n\nTransformation of a flux rope to an ICME\n\nin\n\nB (nT)\n\n50\n\nend\n\nB\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n\u03b8\n\n0\n\n\u03c6B\n\n200\n\nV (Km/s)\n\n\u2212100\n\n0\n900\n800\n700\n600\n\np\n\nback\n\ncenter\n\n0\n100\n\nn (cm\u22123)\n\nout1 out3\nout2\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n2\n\n\u03b2\n\np\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\nTime after (Hs) Nov 9, 2004 UT\n\nFigure 1.

The vertical dashed line \"in\" corresponds to the start of the field\ncoherent rotation (beginning of the MC, Nov. 9 at 20:30 UT), the vertical dotted line to\nthe cloud center (Nov. 10 at 02:02 UT, see Section 3.3), the vertical dash-dotted lines\n~\n\"out1 \" and \"out3 \" to the extremes of the range of possible endings for the rotation of B\n(end of the cloud, Nov. 10 at 08:15 UT and 10:20 UT), and the dash-dotted line \"out2 \"\nto a strong discontinuity (in between this range, on Nov. 10, at 09:00 UT). The thin solid\nvertical line \"back\" marks a strong magnetic discontinuity (Nov. 11, at 06:02 UT) and the\nthick vertical solid line \"end\" the end of the ICME (Nov. 11, at 18:45 UT). Horizontal\ndotted lines in \u03b8B and \u03c6B panels indicate the orientation of Parker's spiral, while the one\nin \u03b2p panel marks the mean value for a set of MCs studied by Lepping et al. (2003).\n\nthus, the MC is formed by a left-handed flux rope with its axis almost on\nthe ecliptic and pointing to the west (yGSE < 0 or \u03c6B \u223c 270\u25e6 ).\nA characteristic of this MC is its very strong expansion (see panel V in\nFigure 1). The observed plasma velocity, V , goes from \u223c 850 km/s at the\nbeginning to \u223c 700 km/s close to the cloud end, a difference of 150 km/s\nin the observed time range (\u223c 15 hours). This implies an expansion of \u223c\n10 km/s per hour.\n\ndassoetal.tex; 6/11/2018; 5:56; p.5\n\n\f6\n\nDasso et al.\n\nThe MC rear boundary is uncertain, the vertical dash-doted lines in\nFigure 1 indicate a possible range (from Nov. 10 at 8:15 UT to 10:20 UT,\n~ and\nlabels \"out1 \" and \"out3 \", respectively). However, the decrease of |B|\nthe strong expansion are still present at later times indicating a backward\nextension of the MC. The mean value of \u03b2p (ratio of the proton pressure\nto the magnetic pressure) is 0.12 for a sample of MCs studied by Lepping\net al. (2003) (horizontal dotted line in panel \u03b2p of Figure 1). Then, another\nindication that the MC is more extended in the back is the presence of\n\u03b2p < 0.12 after 10:20 UT. This region extends up to a strong discontinuity\nin \u03b8B and density (on Nov. 11 at 06:02 UT, label \"back\" in Figure 1). We\ncall the region between \"out3 \" and \"back\" simply the back region of the MC.\nFinally, there is a region with weak, but coherent, field between the \"back\"\nand \"end\" boundaries. The physical origin of these regions is analyzed in\nSection 3.5.\n2.3. Orientation and extension of the cloud\nTo facilitate the understanding of the MC properties, we define a system\nof coordinates linked to the cloud in which \u1e91cloud is along the cloud axis\n(with Bz,cloud > 0). We define the latitude angle (\u03b8) between the ecliptic\nplane and the cloud axis, as well as the longitude angle (\u03c6) between the\nprojection of the axis on the ecliptic plane and the Earth-Sun direction\n(x\u0302GSE ) measured counterclockwise. Then, when \u03b8=90\u25e6 (\u03b8=-90\u25e6 ) the cloud\naxis is parallel (antiparallel) to \u1e91GSE and it points to the ecliptic North\n(South). When \u03b8=0\u25e6 the cloud axis is on the ecliptic plane, \u03c6=0\u25e6 being the\ncase of the axial field pointing toward the Sun, and \u03c6=90\u25e6 (\u03c6=270\u25e6 ) when\nit points to the terrestrial dusk (dawn).\nSince the speed of an MC is nearly in the Sun-Earth direction and it\nis much larger than the spacecraft speed (which can be supposed to be at\nrest during the cloud observing time), we assume a rectilinear spacecraft\ntrajectory in the cloud frame. The trajectory defines a direction d\u02c6 (pointing\ntoward the Sun); then, we define \u0177cloud in the direction \u1e91cloud \u00d7 d\u02c6 and x\u0302cloud\ncompletes the right-handed orthonormal base (x\u0302cloud , \u0177cloud , \u1e91cloud ). We also\ndefine the impact parameter, p, as the minimum distance from the spacecraft\nto the cloud axis. Then, we construct a rotation matrix from the GSE system\nto the cloud system and obtain the components of the observed magnetic\nfield in the cloud coordinates: Bx,cloud , By,cloud , Bz,cloud .\nThe local system of coordinates is especially useful when p is small compared to the MC radius (R). In particular, for p = 0 and an MC described\n~\nby a cylindrical magnetic configuration B(r)\n= Bz (r)\u1e91 + B\u03c6 (r)\u03c6\u0302, we have\nx\u0302cloud = r\u0302 and \u0177cloud = \u03c6\u0302 when the spacecraft leaves the cloud. In this\nparticular case, the magnetic field data will show: Bx,cloud = 0, a large and\ncoherent variation of By,cloud (with a change of sign), and an intermediate\n\ndassoetal.tex; 6/11/2018; 5:56; p.6\n\n\fTransformation of a flux rope to an ICME\n\n7\n\nand coherent variation of Bz,cloud , from low values at one cloud edge, taking\nthe largest value at its axis and returning to low values at the other edge.\nThe minimum variance (MV) method (Sonnerup and Cahill, 1967) has\nbeen used to estimate the orientation of MCs (see e.g., Bothmer and Schwenn,\n1998, Lepping et al., 1990, Farrugia et al., 1999, Dasso et al., 2003, Gulisano\net al., 2005). It gives a good estimation if p is small compared to R and if\nthe in-/out-bound magnetic fields are not significantly asymmetric.\nHowever, when the cloud presents a strong expansion, as in the event\nstudied here, the directions derived by the MV method will mix two different\n~ (1) the effect of the coherent rotation of B\n~ (which\neffects in the variance of B:\nprovides the cloud orientation), and (2) the effect of the cloud 'aging' (the\ndecrease of the field strength with time due to magnetic flux conservation\ncombined with cloud expansion). This latter effect is not associated with the\n~\ncloud orientation; thus, we apply the MV technique to B/B\nto decrease the\ncloud 'aging' consequences.\nWe start the analysis taking the \"in\" and the \"out3 \" boundaries, since\nthe strongest magnetic discontinuity is located at \"out3 \". With these bound~ in the cloud frame, as\naries, we find the typical shape of the components of B\ndiscussed above (see Section 3.3 for further justifications). The MV method\napplied to the normalized field gives \u03b8=-23\u25e6 and \u03c6=274\u25e6 . With the same\nprocedure and an end boundary on Nov. 10, 10:00UT, Harra et al. (2006)\nfound \u03b8=-20\u25e6 and \u03c6=276\u25e6 . Changing the cloud end between \"out1 \" and\n\"out3 \", the ranges for \u03b8 and \u03c6 are: \u03b8 \u223c[-25,0]\u25e6 and \u03c6 \u223c[260,280]\u25e6 .\n2.4. The data in the cloud frame\nFigure 2 shows the components of the magnetic and velocity field in the cloud\nframe for an orientation of the cloud axis such that: \u03b8 = \u221210\u25e6 and \u03c6 = 275\u25e6\n(this orientation is justified in Section 3.2). The magnetic field components\nshow the typical large scale shape of MCs when the impact parameter is\nsmall compared with the cloud radius. However, an inner and non-typical\nsub-structure is present at its center (mainly observed in By,cloud , where it\nis antisymmetric).\nA strong expansion is observed in the velocity components, mainly along\nx\u0302cloud . This is expected from the MC orientation and the data in GSE since,\nas \u03c6 \u223c 270\u25e6 , the spacecraft cannot observe different parcels of fluid along a\nlarge range of zcloud values. However, a weak signature of expansion along\nthe cloud axis can be observed in Vz,cloud (Figure 2). For an MC with \u03b8 \u223c 0\nand \u03c6 > 270\u25e6 , an axial expansion is characterized by Vz,cloud < 0 in the\nfront, changing to Vz,cloud > 0 in the back. This is just what is observed in\nour case when the mean value of Vz,cloud is removed within the cloud. This\ngives us the clue that \u03c6 is larger than 270\u25e6 .\n\ndassoetal.tex; 6/11/2018; 5:56; p.7\n\n\f8\n\nDasso et al.\n\nBz,cloud\n\nBy,cloud\n\nBx,cloud\n\nin\n50\n\nback\n\nend\n\n0\n\u221250\n50\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n0\n\u221250\n50\n0\n\nVx,cloud\n\n\u2212600\n\nVy,cloud\n\n\u221250\n\n100\n\nVz,cloud\n\nout1 out3\ncenter out2\n\n\u2212800\n\n0\n\u2212100\n100\n0\n\u2212100\n\nTime after (Hs) Nov 9, 2004 UT\n\nFigure 2.

In this frame \u1e91cloud is along the cloud axis (\u03b8 = \u221210\u25e6 and \u03c6 = 275\u25e6 in\nGSE coordinates), \u0177cloud is orthogonal to both the MC axis and the spacecraft trajectory,\nand x\u0302cloud completes the right-handed orthogonal base.

The first panel in Figure 2 shows that the observed Bx,cloud has a slightly\nnegative mean value. The sign of Bx,cloud , together with the evolution of\nBy,cloud , implies that the flux rope axis is above the ecliptic plane.\n\n3. Results with the Direct Method\n3.1. The Direct Method\nIn this section we summarize and extend the direct method presented by\nDasso et al. (2006). This method lets us find the rear boundary of a flux\n\ndassoetal.tex; 6/11/2018; 5:56; p.8\n\n\fTransformation of a flux rope to an ICME\n\n9\n\nrope for a given axis orientation, or the reverse, the MC orientation for\na given position of the rear boundary. The front boundary of a flux rope\nis usually well defined by a discontinuity of the magnetic field (changing\nabruptly from a fluctuating field in the MC sheath to a strong and coherent\nfield within the MC). The corresponding current sheet is expected to be\npresent all around the flux rope as the limit between magnetic regions\nwith different magnetic connectivities; so, with different magnetic stresses. A\ncorresponding magnetic discontinuity, labeled \"out\", is then expected at the\nrear of the MC. The flux rope is present in between these two discontinuities\nand the same amount of azimuthal flux is traversed twice by the spacecraft.\nLet us consider a flux rope at a given time. The conservation of the\n~ *B\n~ = 0) across a plane formed by the spacecraft trajectory\nmagnetic flux (\u2207\nand \u1e91cloud (ycloud constant) gives (Dasso et al., 2006):\nZ\n\nflux rope\n\nBy,cloud dx dz = 0 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwith x, z being the spatial coordinates in the x\u0302cloud and \u1e91cloud directions,\nrespectively.\nThe observations provide only By,cloud as a function of time along the\ntrajectory. So, we need two hypothesis: an invariance of By,cloud along the\nflux rope axis and the conservation of the magnetic flux with time. The first\nhypothesis is justified by a low ratio of the MC radius over the expected\ncurvature radius of the axis and the balance of magnetic torques, which\nis expected to homogenize the field along the axial direction (Dasso et al.,\n2006). The second hypothesis is valid as far as the amount of magnetic flux\nreconnected during the spacecraft crossing is low. Indeed, we have found that\nmagnetic flux is reconnected in the front of the MC (see Section 3.5). An\nestimation of the amount of flux reconnected during the spacecraft crossing\ngives \u223c 5% of the initial azimuthal flux (see Section 3.6); so, unless the\nreconnection rate is much higher during the observing time than it was\nduring the travel from the Sun, the amount of reconnected flux is small\nduring the crossing. We neglect below such reconnected flux.\nThe elementary flux crossed during dt is By,cloud (t) L(t) Vx,cloud (t) dt,\nwhere L(t) is the axial length of the portion of the flux rope which had a\nlength Lin = L(tin ) when the spacecraft entered the MC. Then, Equation (1)\nbecomes:\nZ\n\nflux rope\n\nBy,cloud (t) L(t) Vx,cloud (t) dt = 0 .\n\n(2)\n\nIf the axis orientation and the position of one boundary of an MC are\nknown, the above flux balance property can be used to find the MC center\nand the other boundary as follows. We define the accumulative flux per unit\n\ndassoetal.tex; 6/11/2018; 5:56; p.9\n\n\f10\n\nDasso et al.\n21\n\n21\n\nx 10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n6\n\n4\n\n4\n\nFy/Lin (Mx/AU)\n\n8\n\ny\n\nin\n\nF /L (Mx/AU)\n\nx 10\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0\n\nDistance (AU) after:09\u2212Nov\u22122004 20:30:19UT\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\nDistance (AU) after:09\u2212Nov\u22122004 20:30:19UT\n\n~ perpendicular to both the trajectory of the spacecraft and to\nFigure 3.

In both panels the cloud\norientation was taken as \u03b8 = \u221210\u25e6 and \u03c6 = 275\u25e6 .

The position where Fy (x)/Lin has its absolute extreme\ngives an estimation of the position where the spacecraft reaches the closest\ndistance to the MC axis. This indicates the x position of the MC center,\nbeing this estimation more precise as the impact parameter is lower. Then,\nwhen Fy (x)/Lin goes back to zero at x = Xout , we have the other boundary.\nThe region from x = Xin to x = Xout defines the MC flux rope.\nSince the ratio of the MC radius to the Sun distance is small (typically \u2248\n0.1 or lower), L(t\u2032 )/Lin \u2248 1. Below we derive a correction to this estimation.\nIf the MC axis does not change drastically its shape, and if it does not\ndisconnect from the Sun during the crossing time, its length is evolving\nproportionally to its distance to the Sun, D(t), so L(t)/Lin = D(t)/Din\n(where Din \u2248 1 AU for the present observations).

Refined orientation of the cloud\nThe direct method was previously applied to the Oct. 18-20, 1995, MC\n(Dasso et al., 2006). The orientation of its axis was well determined. The\nstrong frontal discontinuity in the magnetic field was naturally related to another strong backward discontinuity, the flux balance given by Equation (2)\nwas satisfied, and L(t) was constant.\nThe orientation of the axis of the MC studied here is not so well determined; then, we explore different orientations to find which angles (\u03b8 and \u03c6)\ngive a cancellation of Fy at the strongest magnetic discontinuity observed at\nthe MC rear (labeled \"out3 \" in Figures 1, 2), at the inner extreme labeled\n\"out1 \", and at the intermediate time \"out2 \" (between \"out1 \" and \"out3 \").\nDue to the orientation of the MC (i.e., its axis almost lying on the ecliptic and\nperpendicular to the Sun-Earth direction) Fy is mostly affected by the value\nof \u03b8. We find \u03b8 = \u221210\u25e6 \u00b110\u25e6 from variations of the end boundaries in the full\nrange between \"out1 \" and \"out3 \", and using the two extreme possibilities\non the axial expansion (no axial expansion, L(t) = Lin , and axial expansion\nproportional to the distance to the Sun, Equation 4). The value of \u03c6 is\nconstrained by imposing that Bx,cloud (t) should have a small variation with\ntime (as expected in flux rope models); so, with no contribution of azimuthal\nor axial field components. This gives \u03c6 = 275\u25e6 \u00b1 10\u25e6 .\nLeft panel of Figure 3 shows Fy for L(t) = Lin (no axial expansion)\nand an orientation such that Fy is canceled at the discontinuity \"out3 \",\nwhich gives \u03b8 = \u221210\u25e6 and \u03c6 = 275\u25e6 . The rear boundary of the MC is\nin fact ambiguous from the data, since there is also a strong discontinuity\nbetween \"out1 \" and \"out3 \" (\"out2 \", at Nov 10, at 09:00UT), see Figures 1\nand 2. Fixing the previous orientation, but using the axial expansion given\nin Equation (4) (see panel in Figure 3), we find that the cancellation of Fy\nis now at \"out2 \". With this boundary, we find a much less extended region\nwith a reversal of Bz,cloud at the back of the MC. So, this boundary gives\nan MC field closer to the one inferred from a classical MC model. In this\ncase, the results of the direct method agree with those of the fitted models\n(including expansion, Section 4). These are evidences that we have identified\nthe right end boundary and orientation of the flux rope.\n3.3. Structure of the cloud\nThe field component By,cloud vanishes at three locations near the cloud center\n(close to the vertical dotted line at the abscissa \u223c 0.1 AU in Figure 3). Taking\ninto account the expected antisymmetry of the in- and out-bound regions,\nwe set the cloud center at Nov. 10 at 02:02 UT (dotted line in Figure 3).\nThen, the accumulated flux Fy /Lin (Equation 3) gives a unique relationship\nbetween the in- and out-bound data, since it labels each flux surface. This\nrelationship is better shown using Fy /Lin in the abscissa and reversing the\n\ndassoetal.tex; 6/11/2018; 5:56; p.11\n\n\fDasso et al.\n\n40\n\n40\n\n30\n\n30\n\n20\n\n20\n\nBy,cloud\n\nBy,cloud\n\n12\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u221210\n\n\u221210\n\n\u221220\n\n\u221220\n\n\u221230\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nFy/Lin (Mx/AU)\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n21\n\nx 10\n\n\u221230\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nFy/Lin (Mx/AU)\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n21\n\nx 10\n\n~ in function of the\nFigure 4.

Then, peaks and\nvalleys of By,cloud in the in-/out-bound branches can be related. As expected,\nthis association is stronger near the MC center where the regions that are\ncrossed are closer and also more isolated from the interaction with the solar\nwind environment (Dasso et al., 2005a). Except for the strong discontinuity\nat the MC borders, the association between structures is not clear outside the\ncore (where By,cloud has no characteristic variations that can be recognized\nin both the in- and out-bound branches).\nThere is a clearly distinguishable sub-structure in the cloud center seen\nas reversed peaks in By,cloud and as a valley in Fy /Lin (Figure 3). It has a\nsmall extension, \u223c \u00b110\u22122 AU, and is globally anti-symmetric. A less evident\nsub-structure was also present in the previously analyzed MC (18 Oct. 1995,\nDasso et al., 2006).\nIf p = 0, the central sub-structure would imply the presence of a small\ntwisted flux tube with opposite magnetic helicity in the center of the flux\nrope. The formation of such a structure is not possible in the corona. After\nanalyzing several possibilities, the simplest interpretation is the following.\nClose to the minimum approach, the spacecraft trajectory is nearly tangent\nto the magnetic flux surfaces of the flux rope (By,cloud \u2248 0). Any warping\nof the flux surfaces gives a clear signal in the By,cloud component. For geometrical reasons, such warping is more difficult to detect outside the center\n(where By,cloud is important). It is noteworthy that such structure will be\nevident only if the magnetic data are rotated to the correct MC frame to\nhave no mixing with the strong Bz,cloud component.\nFor the 18 Oct. MC, the warping was moderate and By,cloud kept its sign\ninside both the in- and the out-bound regions. For the Nov. 9-10 MC, the\nwarping is more marked as sketched in Figure 5.

The magnetic structure of the flux rope is undulated, probably due\nto its fast evolution and interaction with the surrounding medium. The undulations are\namplified in this scheme for clarity, but in the observed MC they are significant enough\nto produce reversals of By,cloud .

Considering the\ncloud as a flux rope, which is compatible with the observations, the same\naccumulated flux Fy /Lin implies that the in- and out-bound field lines are\nconnected (i.e., they are in fact the same field line observed twice). Thus,\nfor example '1' is connected to '5'. The flux Fy /Lin has a local maximum\nat '2' and '4' and a local minimum at '3' when the spacecraft trajectory is\ntangent to the field lines.\n3.4.

The uncertainty in the MC boundary of the\nout-bound branch has a lower effect since the difference of F\u03c6 found with\nthe boundary \"out1 \" and \"out3 \" is only about 10% (see Table I).\nThe axial flux Fz , across a surface perpendicular to the cloud axis, can\nbe estimated directly from the observations assuming a circular MC cross\nsection, p = 0 and neglecting the expansion to compute r = x(t) \u2212 xcenter .\nHere, we neglect the axial flux in the core since it is a correction of the\norder of (p/R)2 , see Dasso et al. (2006). Then, for the out-bound branch we\ncompute Fzout\u2212bound as (idem for Fzin\u2212bound , but with the integration between\ntin and tcenter ):\nFzout\u2212bound\n\n= 2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\ntout\n\ntcenter\n\nBz,cloud (t\u2032 ) (x(t\u2032 ) \u2212 xcenter ) Vx,cloud (t\u2032 ) dt\u2032\n\n(5)\n\nAs in previously studied MCs (e.g. Mandrini et al. 2005, 2007; Attrill et al.,\n2006) Fz is one order of magnitude lower than F\u03c6 (see Table I).\n3.5. Structure of the ICME\nThe analysis of Fy /Lin in Section 3.3 indicates that this MC is not formed\nonly by a flux rope. Some of the MC characteristics (see Figure 1), such\nas a very unusually high magnetic field with a low variance, a low \u03b2p , and\na strong expansion, continue well after the rear boundary of the flux rope\n(\"out1 \", \"out2 \", and \"out3 \"). We discuss below the most plausible physical\nscenario to create such magnetic structure.\nThere is an extended region where By,cloud has still a negative and coherent behavior from position \"out3 \" to \"back\", so the accumulated flux keeps\nincreasing monotonously (Figure 3). This behavior was also found in the\n18 Oct. 1995 MC and it was interpreted as the trace of an original larger\nmagnetic flux rope whose front was partially reconnected with the overtaken\nmagnetic flux, as shown in Figure 6 of Dasso et al. (2006). In the example\nanalyzed here, this interpretation has even more support from the data,\nsince part of the overtaken flux is still present in front of the MC and we\ncan estimate when reconnection started.\nThere is a coherent negative By,cloud field just in front of the MC (from\n\u2248 18:00 UT to 20:30 UT, Figure 2). We interpret this as the remnant of the\nmagnetic flux which reconnected with the original flux rope. At the time of\nobservations, the MC overtakes this structure with a velocity difference of\n\u2248 40 km/s; so reconnection is driven. Such velocity difference is crucial for\nreconnection efficiency since its rate increases with a larger velocity difference (Schmidt and Cargill, 2003). Furthermore, Burlaga (1995) and Farrugia\net al. (2001) have found that magnetic holes, such as the one preceding the\nMC analyzed here (top panel of Figure 1), are associated with magnetic\nreconnection.\n\ndassoetal.tex; 6/11/2018; 5:56; p.14\n\n\fTransformation of a flux rope to an ICME\n\n15\n\nTaking into account the previous reconnection scenario, the back region,\nwhere By,cloud has still a coherent negative value, is simply the magnetic\nflux at the periphery of the original flux rope. This back region keeps the\nproperties of typical MCs without fitting in the standard flux rope models.\nIf the front reconnected, this back region is connected to the solar wind\nfield; so, the magnetic field direction can change because of the propagation\nof Alfven waves, as observed here with the reversal of Bz,cloud (Figure 2).\nHowever, if there is no other reconnection process, the flux of By,cloud cannot\nbe removed from the back of the MC; in fact, we find no other field to allow\nsuch reconnection. Thus, the closed (flux balanced) flux rope observed at\n1 AU is embedded in a larger structure which includes an extended back\nregion. This flux rope was part of a larger one that was partially pealed at\nits front because it reconnected with its environment.\n3.6. Clues for magnetic reconnection\nThe high velocity of the MC (Vc \u2248 800 km/s), compared to its surroundings\n(\u2248 600 km/s) implies a progressive extension of the back region (between\nboundaries \"out3 \" and \"back\" in Figure 2). Assuming that the relative\nvelocity, Vc \u2212 Vback , was similar at earlier times and that the By,cloud component (in the back region) had initially a value similar to that in the rear\nof the MC (because of pressure balance), we can estimate the period of\ntime \u03b4t between the start of reconnection and the MC observations. The\nrange of time between the observation of the two extremes of the expanding\nregion (between \"out3 \" and \"back\") is \u03c4expansion \u2248 18 h. This corresponds\nto a spatial extension of \u223c \u03c4expansion Vback when the region was observed.\nSo, the back region expands in size by \u03c4expansion Vback since the start of\nreconnection at the MC front. This extension has its origin in the relative\nvelocity between the MC and the back region (which becomes lower because\nof its magnetic connection to the solar wind). From the beginning of the\nreconnection at the MC front, starting a lapse of time \u03b4t earlier than the\nobservations, the \"back\" boundary progressively separates from the MC with\na relative velocity VMC \u2212 Vback . Assuming that this relative velocity was not\nchanging drastically during the MC transit, the back region expanded by\n\u2248 (VMC \u2212 Vback )\u03b4t. Equating the previous estimations of the back region\nextension, we find:\n\u03b4t \u2248\n\n\u03c4expansion Vback\n\u2248 18 \u00d7 600/200 \u2248 54 h .\nVc \u2212 Vback\n\n(6)\n\nThe solar event that is the most probable source for the MC studied here\noccurred in AR 10696. It is a multiple event that starts with a steep rise\nin GOES light curve at \u223c 15:50 UT on Nov. 7, and has two clear peaks,\none at \u223c 16:00 UT and the other at \u223c 16:35 UT. At the time of the second\n\ndassoetal.tex; 6/11/2018; 5:56; p.15\n\n\f16\n\nDasso et al.\n\npeak a large two-ribbon flare was observed within AR 10696, but also two\nH\u03b1 ribbons were seen at both sides of an erupting trans-equatorial filament\nextending from AR 10696 to AR 10695 at the southwest (see Harra et al.,\n2006). During this intense event that reached class X2.0 in soft X-rays the\nfull neutral line, which formed a switch-back, erupted. The CME observed\nin the Large Angle and Spectroscopic Coronagraph (SOHO/LASCO) C2 on\nthe Nov. 7 at 16:54 UT is associated with this multiple flare involving AR\n10696 and the erupting trans-equatorial filament to the southwest. Longcope\net al. (2007) have proposed that the source of the MC is the AR eruption,\nwhile Harra et al. (2006) have considered both possibilities either the AR or\nthe trans-equatorial filament eruption. We discuss below these scenarios in\nview of our IP analysis.\nTaking \u223c 15:50 UT on Nov. 7, as the start time of the solar event, and\nan arrival time for the MC front at \u223c 20:30 UT on Nov. 9, we obtain a\ntransit time of \u223c 52 h, comparable to the transit time (\u223c 47 h) computed\nassuming a constant MC velocity of -800 km/s and the spacecraft located at\nL1. Both estimations are comparable to \u03b4t (Equation 6); this implies that\nreconnection started when the flux rope was close to the Sun.\nWhat could be the magnetic structure present in front of the flux rope,\nprobably already from its origin in the corona? The field in front of the MC\nis oriented mostly southward with an average field intensity of \u223c -30 nT,\nthough there is a structure of northward oriented field with a temporal length\nbetween 19:54 UT and 20:01 UT on Nov. 9, an average field strength of \u223c\n-15 nT, and a spatial extension of \u223c 0.002 AU (taking an average velocity\nof \u223c -800 km/s). Analyzing the MDI magnetogram on Nov. 7, the most\nprobable origin of the southward oriented structure is the large scale, nearly\npotential field of AR 10696. If the source of the MC is the AR eruption;\nthen, the core of the AR should become kink unstable (as it was observed\nin an eruption which occurred in the same AR three days later (Williams\net al., 2005)). In the kink instability, part of the twist is transformed into\nwrithe implying a strong rotation of the flux rope. Taking into account the\nMC orientation found in Section 3.2, this rotation should be \u223c 160\u25e6 . The\nMHD simulation of Gibson et al. (2004) gives a writhing of the flux tube of \u223c\n120\u25e6 (before it reconnects with the overlying field). Numerical simulations\nby T\u00f6r\u00f6k and Kliem (2005) confirm this using a different approach and,\nindeed, the writhing could be as large as a rotation of 160\u25e6 depending on\nthe properties of the overlying field (T\u00f6r\u00f6k, private communication). So the\namount of rotation and its direction (for a left-handed flux rope), if the MC\nflux rope comes from the AR, is coherent with recent MHD simulations of\nkink unstable flux ropes.\nInterplanetary scintillation observations suggest that the material from\nthe core of the AR was ejected primarily northward and, thus, it could\nremain unobserved at 1 AU (see Harra et al., 2006). In this scenario, and if\n\ndassoetal.tex; 6/11/2018; 5:56; p.16\n\n\fTransformation of a flux rope to an ICME\n\n17\n\nthe source of the MC is the trans-equatorial filament eruption, the direction\nof the trans-equatorial filament and the cloud axis differ by 670 (see Figure\n12 in Harra et al., 2006). Moreover, the sense of rotation from the filament\nto the cloud axis is opposite to the one expected from the development of a\nkink instability in a region of left-handed magnetic helicity. As discussed by\nHarra et al. (2006), it may happen that the kink instability has not played\na role far away from the strong fields of the AR. The northward oriented\nstructure observed between 19:54 UT and 20:01 UT on Nov. 9 could be\nrelated to the northward oriented trans-equatorial loops observed above the\nfilament. However, in both scenarios reconnection should be forced between\nthe ejected flux rope and the above AR arcade field from the beginning of the\neruption. This explains the origin of a nearly antiparallel field (neglecting\nthe short period of northward directed field) in front of the flux rope from\nthe beginning of the launch, as indicated by a value of \u03b4t similar to the\ntransit time.\nOur previous discussion has implications for the reconnection rate in a\ncollisionless plasma. While the erupting flux rope pushed against an overlying nearly anti-parallel magnetic field, we still observe part of this overlying\nflux in front of the MC at 1 AU! Of course we have no way to determine\nhow strong was the forcing, nor the time dependence of the reconnection\nrate during the flux rope transit. Still this observation is a clue that magnetic reconnection is not efficient in a collisionless plasma, as expected from\nclassical theory. Some recent observations show direct evidence of magnetic\nreconnection in a collisionless plasma as the solar wind (Gosling et al.,\n2005). Some numerical simulations show that the Hall effect can increase\nthe reconnection rate above the classical rate (e.g., Morales et al., 2005).\nOur observations set a constrain on the reconnection rate, which can be\nquantified only after a numerical modeling of the flux rope ejection and\ntransit to 1 AU.\nFrom the computed accumulated flux (Figure 3) we can estimate the\nrelative amount of reconnected flux from the original flux rope ejected from\nthe Sun as \u2248 1.25/7.4 \u2248 17%, assuming L(t) = Lin (left panel). With\nthe expansion length given by Equation (4), the flux present in the back\npart, which is the fraction of reconnected flux, is \u2248 30% (however it is not\nobvious that we can use Equation (4) for the back part where the field is\nconnected to the solar wind). The relative amount of flux present in front of\nthe MC is \u2248 0.6/7.4 \u2248 8%. This implies that the relative amount of stable\n(not kinked) magnetic flux, arch-like, above the erupting flux rope is in the\ninterval [25, 38]% of the azimuthal flux in the MC.\nFinally, a fraction of the By,cloud magnetic flux observed after the boundary \"in\" is expected to be reconnected when the spacecraft exits the flux\nrope. To estimate an order of magnitude for this flux, let us suppose that\nthe reconnection rate was comparable to its mean value during the transit\n\ndassoetal.tex; 6/11/2018; 5:56; p.17\n\n\f18\n\nDasso et al.\n\nfrom the Sun. The amount of reconnected flux during the MC observing\ntime is the ratio of the crossing time (\u2248 14 h) over the transit time from the\nSun (\u2248 52 h) times the flux reconnected from the Sun. Then, \u223c 5% of the\noriginal flux was reconnected during the MC crossing time. So, the fraction\nof flux reconnected between t = tin and tout is expected to be an amount\nmuch lower than the uncertainties in the flux estimations (see Table I).\n\n4. Results using fitted models\nThis cloud presents a large velocity difference between its front and rear\nparts (fourth panel in Figure 1). This velocity difference is the consequence\nof a large MC size and a significant expansion. Both conditions imply that\nthe magnetic field is observed at significantly different times during the\nMC crossing, so at times when the MC has significant different sizes. As a\nconsequence of magnetic flux conservation, this implies the observed decay of\nB with time (upper panel of Figure 1). Then, Bz,cloud , and even more By,cloud\n(since it is stronger close to the flux rope borders) presents a remarkable\nasymmetry between the in- and out-bound branches. Moreover, the center of\nthe cloud is observed before the central observing time for the full structure,\nas expected for an spatially symmetric expanding object.\nIn this section we compare the observations to fitted models describing the\nevolution of the magnetic field assuming an isotropic self-similar expansion.\nThe observed velocity is used to derive the expansion rate, which is then\nused in the expansion magnetic model. We also quantify the magnetic fluxes\nfrom the fitted models, and compare them with the results obtained from a\nclassical static model and the direct method.\n4.1. Expansion Model\nWe assume an isotropic self-similar expansion of the MC, where all distances\nare multiplied by a factor f (t):\n~r(t) = ~r0 f (t) ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere f (t0 ) = 1 and ~r0 is the position of a given element of fluid at some\nreference time t0 . Since the MC front boundary, called \"in\", is well defined,\nwe select this as the reference time, t0 = tin . Each element of fluid is labeled\nby its ~r0 value, then the ~r0 coordinate is a marker of each element of fluid\n(Lagrangian coordinates).\nWe assume below that the flux rope size increases linearly with time.\nThen, f (t) can be written as:\nf (t) = 1 + (t \u2212 tin )/T ,\n\n(8)\n\ndassoetal.tex; 6/11/2018; 5:56; p.18\n\n\fTransformation of a flux rope to an ICME\n\n19\n\nwhere T is the time of expansion. If Equation (8) would be valid for all\nthe transit time from the Sun, then the flux rope size would vanish at time\nt = tin \u2212 T , so T would also be approximately the transit time from the Sun\nto the position observed at tin . In practice, we use Equation (8) only during\nthe MC crossing; so, we are only assuming a local linear increase of the size\nwith time. Depending on the evolution during the transit from the Sun, T\ncould be different from the transit time.\n~ in the cloud frame comes\nThe time evolution for the plasma velocity V\nfrom Equation (7) doing the temporal derivative and keeping ~r0 fixed (so\nfollowing a plasma element):\n~ (t) =\nV\n\n~r0\n~r\n=\n.\nT + t \u2212 tin\nT\n\n(9)\n\nThe first equality gives the velocity at a given time t, so it is proportional to\nthe distance. The velocity decays with time, but this decay is only apparent\nsince when one follows a given plasma element, defined by ~r0 , the velocity\nis in fact constant (second equality). Then, Equation (8) implies that there\nare no forces acting on any plasma element (free expansion). This is an \"a\nposteriori\" justification of Equation (7); for an isotropic expansion, an initial\nforce-free field stays force-free.\nThe observed speed is the sum of the expansion speed and of the global\nspeed of the MC. During the time of observation, we can assume that the\nMC is globally moving at a constant speed \u2212Vc (velocity of the MC center)\nalong x\u0302cloud because the aerodynamic drag significantly affects Vc only in\na time scale comparable or larger than the transit time to 1 AU. We also\nassume that the spacecraft is at rest. Then, the velocity component along\nx\u0302cloud is:\nt \u2212 tc\n.\n(10)\nVx = \u2212Vc + Vc\nT + t \u2212 tin\nThis equation is fitted to the data to derive Vc , tc (the time when the\nspacecraft crosses the cloud center), and T . It is noteworthy that the nearly\nlinear observed Vx is a consequence of the constant speed Vc , and not of the\nlinear expansion with time assumed in Equation (8). The assumed expansion\nintroduces only a non linear correction in (t \u2212 tin ) because the crossing time,\ntout \u2212 tin , of the MC is small compared to the time of expansion, T (a further\ncorrection would come from the non-linear development of a general f (t)).\nThis justifies the use of Equation (8)\n4.2. Results for the expansion\nThe observed Vx,cloud has a globally linear variation with time within the MC\n(Figure 6). To better show its variation, we subtract the mean value of the velocity computed inside the range of positions \"in\" to \"out3 \",\n\ndassoetal.tex; 6/11/2018; 5:56; p.19\n\n\f20\n\nDasso et al.\n\nin\n\ncenter\n\nout1 out3\nout2\n\n200\n\nVx,cloud\u2212<Vx,cloud>, km/sec\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\n\u221250\n\n\u2212100\n\n\u2212150\n\n\u2212200\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nTime after (hs) Nov 9, 2004 UT\n\nFigure 6.

When the impact parameter (p/R) is small,\nas it is in this MC, this speed represents the radial velocity with respect to\nthe cloud axis, such that for a cloud in expansion, Vx,cloud \u2212 < Vx,cloud > is\nnegative before the spacecraft reaches the cloud axis and positive after that.\nFrom a least square fitting of Equation (10) to the velocity data inside\nthe \"in\" to \"out3 \" boundaries, we obtain T \u2248 T3 = 73 h (\u2248 3 days). We find\na slightly longer time of expansion T \u2248 T1 = 79 h (\u2248 3.3 days) when the fit\nis restricted to the interval between the \"in\" and \"out1 \" boundaries, and we\nget T2 = 77 h (\u2248 3.2 days) for boundaries \"in\" to \"out2 \". Considering the\nself-similar expansion given by Equation (8), this implies that the MC has\nexpanded from the time tin by a factor 1.19 and 1.15 when the spacecraft\ncrossed \"out3 \" and \"out1 \", respectively.\nBoth times of expansion, T3 and T1 , are longer than the transit time from\nthe Sun (\u2248 52 h, Section 3.6). Taking an approximately constant global\nvelocity Vc , the distance of the MC front to the Sun increases by the factor\nD(t)/Din \u2248 1 + (t \u2212 tin )Vc /Din (see Equation 4). Doing the ratio of the measured expansion rate variation ( dfdt(t) ) to dD(t)\ndt , we obtain an undimensional\nfactor Din /(Vc T ). This factor is 0.64 and 0.59 for boundaries \"out3 \" and\n\"out1 \", respectively. Considering the orientation of the MC (\u03b8 = \u221210\u25e6 and\n\u03c6 = 275\u25e6 ), the velocity in Figure 6 is measured mainly across the flux rope.\n\ndassoetal.tex; 6/11/2018; 5:56; p.20\n\n\fTransformation of a flux rope to an ICME\n\n21\n\nThen, the MC is expanding at a significantly smaller rate radially than what\nwe expect assuming the isotropic expansion in Equation 4.\nAssuming that the spacecraft trajectory is close enough to the MC axis,\np/R << 1, the observed velocity\nlets us compute the radius of the flux rope\nR\nsince the distance crossed ( Vx,cloud dt) is Rin + Rout = Rin (1 + f (tout )).\nTaking the boundary \"out3 \", we find Rin = 0.12 AU and Rout3 = 0.14 AU;\nwhile for boundary \"out1 \" we find smaller radii, Rin = 0.10 AU and Rout1 =\n0.12 AU. If we do not consider the expansion, we get the mean values because\nthe distance crossed is simply 2R.\n4.3. Magnetic field models\nLundquist's static model (Lundquist, 1950) is a classical linear force free\n \u0304 \u00d7 B\u0304 = \u03b1B\u0304, with \u03b1 constant). From the conservation of\nconfiguration (\u2207\nthe magnetic flux during the expansion, and assuming a Lundquist's field\nat a given time, it is possible to derive an expansion field model (see, e.g.,\nShimazu and Vandas, 2002, Berdichevsky et al., 2003). We will also consider\na more general model where the amplitude of the azimuthal and axial components are independent. This represents an approximation for a flux rope\nwith an oblate cross section (see Vandas and Romashets, 2003 for an exact\nsolution). We consider this modified expansion Lundquist's model to keep\nthe same functional dependence of the field components, so the difference\nbetween the three models is only the number of free parameters (and the\nphysics involved).\nThe three models are described by the equations:\nBr (r, t) = 0 ,\nB\u03c6 (r, t) = Bin,\u03c6 f \u22122 J1 (\u03b1in r/f) ,\n\n(11)\n(12)\n\nBz (r, t) = Bin,z f \u22122 J0 (\u03b1in r/f) ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere Bin,\u03c6 , Bin,z , and \u03b1in are the field and \u03b1 values when the spacecraft\nenters the MC at t = tin . For the static model f = 1 and Bin,\u03c6 = Bin,z = Bin ,\nso there are only two free parameters, Bin and \u03b1in . For both expansion\nmodels f = f (t) is function of time as given by Equation (8). For the\nexpansion Lundquist's model, Bin,\u03c6 = Bin,z = Bin , so there are also two\nfree parameters as for the static model. For the modified model, there is an\nextra free parameter; the parameters are: Bin,\u03c6 , Bin,z and \u03b1in . Notice that\nfor all models Bz is not forced to vanish at the MC boundaries (this lets \u03b1in\nas a free parameter).\nBecause for a fixed time t, each of the components B\u03c6 and Bz have a\nspatial dependence as in Lundquist's model, the equations for the magnetic\nfluxes Fz and F\u03c6 are the same as in Dasso et al. (2006), but now R = R(t) =\nRin f (t) and L = L(t) = Lin f (t) with Rin and Lin the radius and the length\n\ndassoetal.tex; 6/11/2018; 5:56; p.21\n\n\f22\n\nDasso et al.\n50\n\n50\n\n0\n\n\u221250\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n50\n\n30\n\n35\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n50\n\nout1\n\n0\n\n\u221250\n\n0\n\n\u221250\n\n40\n\nBz,cloud, nT\n\nBy,cloud, nT\n\nout3\nBz,cloud, nT\n\nBy,cloud, nT\n\nout3\n\n35\n\n40\n\nTime after (hs) Nov 9, 2004 UT\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n35\n\n40\n\nout1\n\n0\n\n\u221250\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nTime after (hs) Nov 9, 2004 UT\n\nFigure 7.

Both the static and expansion\nLundquist's models overestimate the axial field, Bz,cloud , near the cloud\ncenter and underestimate the azimuthal field, By,cloud , near the boundaries.\nWhen the extra freedom Bin,z 6= Bin,\u03c6 is considered, the model can reproduce\nsignificantly better the observations.\np\n\u03c72 ,\nA quantitative comparison between the different models is given\nby\np\n2\n2\n2\n~\n~\nwhere \u03c7 is the time average of (Bmodel \u2212Bobservations ) . We find \u03c7 =14:16:19 nT,\nfor the modified model, expansion and static Lundquist's models, respectively. For the three models a shift of the positions where By,cloud = 0 and\nwhere Bz,cloud is maximum to a time later than in the observations is present\n(top panels of Figure 7).\nWe also explore the two earlier rear boundaries: \"out1 \" and \"out2 \". A\nsignificant better fit is found with the boundary at positions \"out1 \" and\n\"out2 \" (lower panels in Figure 7 show the fitting for \"out1 \", very similar\nfitted curves are obtained for \"out2 \").\nq\nq comparison between the fits is given in the form\nq A quantitative\n2\n2\n\u03c7out,1 : \u03c7out,2 : \u03c72out,3 in units of nT. For the static model we obtain\n16:17:19, for the expansion model 15:15:16, and for the modified model\n12:12:14.\nIf the boundary is located at \"out2 \", the modeled cloud center corresponds now to Nov. 10 at 02:16UT, 14 minutes later than the center given\nby the observations and the direct method in Section 3.3 (dotted line, Nov\n10, 02:02UT). For a rear boundary at \"out1 \", the modeled cloud center\ncorresponds to Nov. 10 at 01:58UT, only 4 minutes earlier than the value\nobtained using the direct method.\nLet us now analyze the differences between the observations and the best\nmodel (modified Lundquist's model with boundary \"out1 \"). The model follows globally well the observations, except for the central reversal of By,cloud\nand close to the boundaries. This central reversal cannot be taken into account by the model (see Section 3.3 for an analysis of this feature). Close to\nthe boundaries, the asymmetry of the model is not as large as the observed\none; the isotropic expansion model gives By,out1 /By,in = f \u22122 (tout1 ) \u2248 0.75,\nwhile the observations give \u2248 0.5. Due to the crossing geometry, the data\nmainly reflect the radial expansion velocity. Let us now consider a refinement\n\ndassoetal.tex; 6/11/2018; 5:56; p.23\n\n\f24\n\nDasso et al.\n\nTable I. Magnetic fluxes present in the flux rope in units of 1020 Mx using\ndifferent fitted models or the direct method, for three backwards boundaries\n(\"out1 \", \"out2 \", and \"out3 \" in Figures 1 and 2), and for orientation given\nby \u03b8 = \u221210\u25e6 and \u03c6 = 275\u25e6 . For the direct method we present an average\nbetween the values obtained for the in-bound and out-bound branches (Fz is\nnot affected by including axial expansion). The fluxes are not corrected for the\nflux lost by magnetic reconnection during the MC travel from the Sun (since\nonly the direct method permits an estimation of the reconnected flux). The\nthree models are described by the same equations but differ by the constraint\nset on the free parameters, so the physics involved (Equations 11-13). An\ninitial length for the cloud Lin = 1.5 AU is assumed.\nend:\nModel or Method\nstatic\nexpanding\nmodified\ndirect without axial expansion\ndirect with axial expansion\n\n\"out1 \"\nFz\nF\u03c6\n\n\"out2 \"\nFz\nF\u03c6\n\n\"out3 \"\nFz\nF\u03c6\n\n7.4\n7.4\n6.4\n5.0\n5.0\n\n7.7\n7.4\n6.8\n4.7\n4.7\n\n7.4\n6.8\n6.2\n2.1\n2.1\n\n60\n64\n91\n81\n90\n\n60\n67\n96\n85\n95\n\n60\n69\n100\n91\n102\n\nof the above model, the radial expansion is still given by f (t), while the\naxial expansion is rather given by g(t) = L(t)/Lin (Equation (4)). By,cloud is\naffected both by the radial and the axial expansion. The conservation of the\nazimuthal flux gives: By (t) = By,in /[f (t)g(t)]. In the fitting of the models,\nwe have assumed f (t) = g(t), but in fact Din /Vc < T so that g is slightly\nlarger than f . With Din /Vc \u2248 47 h and T \u2248 79 h, we find fout1 = 1.15\nand gout1 = 1.25, which gives By,out1 /By,in \u2248 0.69 (rather than 0.75 with an\nisotropic expansion), a value closer to the observed value (\u2248 0.5) but still\nlarger.\nA spatial asymmetry between the in- and out-bound branches, which\ncannot be attributed to the expansion, is present in the observations (Figure 7). Indeed, the observed By,cloud does not have the expected decrease\ntowards the front boundary (which is present in the model and also in the\nobservations towards \"out1 \", Figure 7). At the MC front the magnetic field\nis expected to be compressed (then, it is enhanced) by the dynamic pressure\nof the overtaken plasma. The interaction with the surroundings is likely to\nbe at the origin of this extra asymmetry (on top of the expansion) between\nthe in- and out-bound branches.\nFrom the fitted parameters and expressions given in Equations (14)- (15),\nwe obtain the values for the magnetic fluxes using the different models\n(Table I). We assume an initial length Lin = 1.5 AU as in Section 3.4.\nFrom Table I, Fz is estimated in the range [2.1-7.7]\u00d71020 Mx, and F\u03c6 in\n\ndassoetal.tex; 6/11/2018; 5:56; p.24\n\n\fTransformation of a flux rope to an ICME\n\n25\n\nthe range [60-102] \u00d71020 Mx. Fixing the end boundary at Nov 10, 10:00 UT\n(only 20 minutes earlier than boundary \"out3 \"), and using the static classical\nLundquist's model, Longcope et al. (2007) reported Fz = 7.2 \u00d7 1020 Mx and\nF\u03c6 /L = 41 \u00d7 1020 Mx/AU (thus F\u03c6 = 62 \u00d7 1020 Mx, for a cloud length of\nL = 1.5 AU, as assumed here). These values, as expected, are very close to\nour present results with the static model and boundary \"out3 \". Our present\nresults show that the expansion affects slightly the computed fluxes (more\nF\u03c6 ), while decoupling the fits of By,cloud and Bz,cloud has the largest effect.\nFor rear boundaries \"out1 \" and \"out2 \", the estimations of both fluxes using\nthe modified Lundquist's model are in close agreement with the results of the\ndirect method that consider an axial expansion, in particular this agreement\nis much better for F\u03c6 . Considering the rear boundary \"out3 \", the value of\nFz obtained from the direct method is lower than the one from the modified\nLundquist's model due to the significantly negative value of Bz,cloud beyond\n\"out2 \" (see Figure 2); this contributes to decrease Fz when integrating the\ncircular cloud section between \"out2 \" to \"out3 \". As discussed in Section 3.2,\nwe believe that the rear boundary of the cloud should be between \"out1 \"\nand \"out2 \".\n\n5. Summary and Conclusions\nThe ICME of Nov 9-10, 2004, was a complex event with a large expansion\nand a strong magnetic field in the front decreasing monotonously (almost\nlinearly) with time. Earlier analysis considered that two magnetic clouds\n(MCs) were located inside this ICME. Latter studies concluded that only\none MC was present. We confirm this and precise the orientation and boundaries of the flux rope using several methods. We also find clues about the\ninteraction of this MC with its surroundings.\nTo facilitate the understanding of the physics involved in the MC it\nis useful to transform the data to the local MC frame where the axial\nand azimuthal components of the magnetic field are decoupled. A classical\nmethod to determine the MC axis is the minimum variance (MV) method,\nwhich takes into account the different spatial behavior of the magnetic field\ncomponents to find the flux rope orientation. We minimize the effect of the\nstrong expansion, which implies a decreasing field magnitude with time,\nnormalizing the field at each data point. This gives a range of possible\norientations (typically with a precision of the order of \u00b120\u25e6 ).\nThe determination of the orientation of the flux rope axis is improved\nusing the direct method. This method is based on two main points: first,\nthe flux rope is topologically distinct from the surroundings, so it should\ngenerically be bounded by a discontinuity of the magnetic field components\n(presence of a current sheet), and second, the same amount of azimuthal\n\ndassoetal.tex; 6/11/2018; 5:56; p.25\n\n\f26\n\nDasso et al.\n\nmagnetic flux should be present in the in- and out-bound branches of the\ncloud. For the cloud of Nov. 9-10, 2004, the frontal discontinuity is well\ndefined, while three rear discontinuities are present, called \"out1 \", \"out2 \",\nand \"out3 \". They are separated by about 2 h compared to a MC duration\nof about 14 h. The azimuthal flux relates the frontal discontinuity to two\ndiscontinuities at the rear using two different hypotheses for the axial evolution: an expansion comparable to the radial one gives a rear discontinuity at\n\"out2 \", and a negligible axial expansion gives a rear discontinuity at \"out3 \".\nHowever, since the second case implies a reversal of the axial field at the rear\nof the MC, we conclude that the first discontinuity (\"out2 \") is associated to\nthe frontal discontinuity. This defines precisely the extension, as well as the\norientation angle \u03b8 (within \u00b15\u25e6 , \u03b8 = 10 \u00b1 5\u25e6 ) of the flux rope.\nFitting a model to the data is another approach to understand the observed magnetic structure. We have used three models that are based on the\nLundquist's solution. The first one is the classical static solution. The second\none includes a self-similar expansion with the same rate in the axial and\nradial directions. Finally, the third one also includes an isotropic expansion\nand decouples the fit of the azimuthal and axial field components to take into\naccount the observed stronger azimuthal component (a possible signature of\na flat cross section). The expansion rate is obtained fitting the model to\nthe observed plasma velocity. The best fits to the data are obtained when\nthe first and second discontinuities (labeled \"out1 \" and \"out2 \") are used, in\nagreement with the results obtained with the direct method.\nComparing the results of the fitted models with the direct method, using\nboundaries \"out1 \" and \"out2 \", we find that the axial and azimuthal fluxes\nare in the ranges [4.7-7.7]\u00d71020 Mx and [60-95]\u00d71020 Mx, respectively. The\nmain limitation on the axial flux measurements is the unknown shape of the\ncross section. For the azimuthal flux, it is important to consider the axial\nexpansion. Here the limitations are different, the shape of the cross section\nis not important, the main limitation is the distribution of the flux along\nthe MC axis. Finally, we confirm that the azimuthal flux is one order of\nmagnitude larger than the axial flux.\n~ some typical MC characterAfter the large and coherent rotation of B,\nistics are still present: low level of fluctuations, strong expansion (observed\nin the decay of V and B), intensity of magnetic field higher than the typical\nsolar wind values, low \u03b2p . These are evidences that the MC extends farther\nin the back of the flux rope. Part of this back (from \"out3 \" to \"back\" in\nFigures 1 and 2) shows a coherent behavior of By,cloud , which we interpret as\nthe signature of an originally larger flux rope that was partially reconnected\nin its front near the Sun, with the consequent flux removal.\nReconnection of the cloud field with the overtaken solar wind field is\nanother source of underestimation of the original magnetic flux that was\nlaunched from the Sun. We have found that \u223c 17 % (with a 30 % as an\n\ndassoetal.tex; 6/11/2018; 5:56; p.26\n\n\fTransformation of a flux rope to an ICME\n\n27\n\nupper bound) of the azimuthal flux was lost in the front of the MC during its\ntravel from the Sun; this is much less than in the Oct. 18-30, 1995 MC, where\nit was estimated to be about 57 % (Dasso et al., 2006). Another difference\nbetween the MCs is that the Nov. 9-10 MC has a back part moving at a\nspeed significantly lower (by \u2248 200 km/s) than the flux rope (while the\nOct. 18-20 MC was overtaken by a fast stream). Then, the reconnected field\nprogressively forms an extended region in the back of the flux rope (with\na weaker magnitude but still with a smooth spatial variation). From the\nextension and velocity difference of this region with the flux rope, we have\nestimated that reconnection started close to the Sun, possibly between the\nerupting twisted flux tube (giving the flux rope) and the overlying arcade of\nactive region 10696. Part of the arcade field is probably present in front of the\nMC, with a nearly anti-parallel direction and a significant velocity difference\n(\u2248 40 km/s), indicating that magnetic reconnection is not so efficient in the\ninterplanetary space.\nReconnection in front of the MC has several observational consequences,\nas follows:\nFirst, it introduces an asymmetry in the observed magnetic field. The\nremaining part of the flux rope is observed first followed by an extended\ntail of weaker magnetic field (which is re-orientated since it has changed\nits connectivity). When this process is dominantly at work, this implies the\npresence of a closed flux rope at the beginning of the ICME.\nSecond, depending on the solar launch direction, the spacecraft could\ncross the flux rope or its laterally extended back part. In this last case, one\nwould detect some characteristics of the MC (such as a coherent field and low\n\u03b2 values), but without the coherent rotation of the field. Such crossing would\nbe classified as an ICME (without MC). An example of such observations\nwith the two HELIOS spacecrafts is analyzed by Cane et al. (1997) and\nanother example using the ACE spacecraft is analyzed by Foullon et al.\n(2007).\nFinally, the back flux connected to the solar wind field makes the moving magnetic structure larger in the transverse direction (orthogonal to the\nglobal motion). From its mixed origin the back region is expected to move at\na speed intermediate between the MC and the solar wind speed, as observed\nin the present analyzed MC. Then, with a significant larger velocity than\nthe surrounding medium, the back region is expected to have an effect on\nthe frontal shock surrounding the ICME. A larger transverse scale implies\na forward shock at a larger distance in front of the MC than the distance\ndeduced by its flux rope transverse size (Farris and Russell, 1994). Such\nlarge distance has so far being interpreted as a flat flux rope (Russell and\nMulligan, 2002). The consequence of reconnection in the front of the MC is\nan alternative and/or complementary explanation which requires numerical\nsimulations to be quantified.\n\ndassoetal.tex; 6/11/2018; 5:56; p.27\n\n\f28\n\nDasso et al.\n\nThe results obtained show the potentiality of combining several methods\nof analysis, minimum variance, direct method and fit to the data. This\nanalysis will be done for other MCs to derive the variety of possible physical\nscenarios and also to improve our understanding of MCs and ICMEs.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are grateful to L.K.
