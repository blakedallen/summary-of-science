In the absence of heat sources, the\ngas will cool and form stars. However, high-resolution Xray spectroscopy of galaxies and clusters has shown that\nthe rate at which gas cools to low temperatures is significantly reduced compared to preliminary expectations (e.g.\nPeterson et al. 2001; Tamura et al. 2001; Xu et al. 2002;\nSakelliou et al. 2002; Peterson et al. 2003; Kaastra et al.\n2004; Peterson & Fabian 2006) suggesting that the gas is\nsomehow being reheated.\nNumerous possible heating mechanisms have been suggested, most notably energy injection by Active Galactic\nNuclei (AGN) (e.g. Binney & Tabor 1995; Tucker & David\n1997; Ciotti & Ostriker 2001) and the inward flux of thermal energy from large radii due to thermal conduction (e.g.\nBregman & David 1988; Gaetz 1989; Zakamska & Narayan\n2003; Pope et al. 2005). Quantifying these heating processes\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail:ecdpope@uvic.ca\n\nc 2011 RAS\n\nis difficult due our incomplete understanding of the microphysics of the X-ray emitting plasma (see Cho et al. 2003;\nParrish et al. 2009, for example). Nevertheless, due to its\nstrong temperature dependence, thermal conduction alone\nprobably cannot provide a general solution to the cooling\nflow problem (e.g. Voigt & Fabian 2004; Pope et al. 2006;\nGuo et al. 2008).\nInstead, it is generally assumed that energy input by a\ncentral AGN is predominantly responsible for reheating the\ngas. This is partly based on a wealth of observational evidence which indicates that radio AGN outflows are triggered\nin response to the thermal state of their environment (e.g.\nBurns 1990; Best et al. 2005; B\u0131\u0302rzan et al. 2004; Dunn et al.\n2005; Best 2007; Rafferty et al. 2008; Cavagnolo et al. 2008;\nMittal et al. 2009). If true, this suggests that AGN activity is part of a negative feedback loop which may regulate\nproperties of its environment.\nTheoretical studies have also provided complimentary\nevidence highlighting the importance of AGN feedback. For\nexample, implementations of AGN heating in semi-analytic\nmodels of galaxy formation have shown that, in principle,\nAGN can both reheat cooling flows and explain the ex-\n\n\f2\n\nE.C.D. Pope\n\nponential cutoff at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function (e.g. Benson et al. 2003; Croton et al. 2006;\nBower et al. 2006; Short & Thomas 2009). More recently,\nAGN heating has been shown to be fundamental in shaping\nthe X-ray luminosity-temperature of massive galaxies (e.g.\nPuchwein et al. 2008; Bower et al. 2008; Pope 2009).\nBroadly speaking, theoretical studies employ AGN\nheating as an input with which to control star formation\nrates and the X-ray luminosity of the hot gas that permeates massive galaxies and galaxy clusters. Essentially, this\nconceptualises AGN feedback as a control system similar\nto a thermostat (c.f. Kaiser 2007). This approach can be\nhighly informative; AGN feedback is an extremely complex\nphenomenon which depends on poorly understood physical\nprocesses occurring across a huge range of spatial scales.\nAs yet, numerical hydrodynamic simulations do not include\nsufficient physical processes to naturally reproduce observations without being complemented by additional numerical\nprescriptions. Yet, even if the simulations were physically\ncomplete, the outcomes would still need to be interpreted.\nFor this reason, we investigate AGN feedback in the\nmost general way, by expressing its overall effect in terms of\nwell-defined global quantities, and comparing the main results with observations. For example, consider the simplest\ncase, in which AGN heating is regulated only by negative\nfeedback. Negative feedback can be defined as a response\nwhich occurs to oppose its cause. Therefore, unless forced\nto do otherwise, it will tend to minimise deviations from\nsome equilibrium condition. Thus, in general, a system regulated purely by negative feedback will rapidly tend towards\na steady state in which the controller is permanently active\nat a constant value. Notably, this does not appear to be the\ncase for AGN feedback, and it is imperative to note that\nminimising deviations from an equilibrium state is only one\nmeasure of the performance of feedback. Depending on additional constraints it can also be favourable to minimise other\nquantities, such as the energy invested in controlling the system. Importantly, a system regulated by feedback subject to\nadditional constraints generally behaves quite differently to\nthe simplest case described above.\nThe choice of constraint adopted in this article is influenced by two principle sets of observations. In particular,\nradio data (e.g. Best et al. 2005, 2007; Shabala et al. 2008)\ncan be used to infer the fraction of time (duty cycle) an AGN\nspends producing kinetic outflows, which couple strongly to\nthe ambient gas. Therefore, a feedback model which yields\ncontinual and constant heating would appear to be inconsistent with data. In addition, any appropriate model must\nalso grow black holes of the masses we observe. For example,\nFujita & Reiprich (2004) found that, in some cases, the accretion energy liberated in growing the supermassive black\nholes at cluster centres seems to be insufficient to have offset\nthe ICM X-ray luminosity over the lifetimes of the clusters.\nThat is, the some black hole masses are lower than expected.\nAs a result, the aim of this article is to find a plausible constraint which forces a simple feedback system to exhibit features that are broadly similar to these observations; heating\nshould proceed in the form of discrete events and at low\nblack hole growth rates, while still balancing gas cooling.\nGuided by these observations, we investigate an energetically favourable model in which feedback heating acts to\nbalance gas cooling, but is also constrained to minimise the\n\ntotal energy output of the system. This means that feedback minimises the sum of the energy radiated by the X-ray\nemitting gas and the energy injected by the AGN, which\nis equivalent to balancing gas cooling with the minimum\nblack hole growth. Such constraints are implemented, with\nthe minimum number of assumptions, by employing optimal\ncontrol theory 1 . Using this approach, we also show that the\nconstraint prevents continuous, constant AGN power output, but favours discrete AGN outbursts with a duty cycle\nwhich depends only on the feedback strength. Therefore, despite being largely empirical, the constraint warrants investigation as a baseline model against which both observations\nand numerical simulations can be compared. However, we\nnote that there may be other equally plausible interpretations, and explanations, of these observations.\nThe outline of the article is as follows. Section 2 outlines a simple feedback model. In Section 3, we investigate\nthe effect of the mimumum energy constraint which is implemented using optimal control theory. The findings are\ndiscussed in section 4 and summarised in section 5.\n\n2\n\nA SIMPLE MODEL\n\nCurrent interpretation of observations suggests that radio\nAGN heating is related to the cooling rate of the hot, Xray emitting gas (e.g. Best et al. 2005; B\u0131\u0302rzan et al. 2004;\nDunn et al. 2005; Nulsen et al. 2007), which itself must\nevolve according to the difference between the AGN heating and gas cooling rates. The precise details of the interaction between a collimated AGN outflow and the ambient\ngas may be relevant on kiloparsec scales, but are much less\nso on larger scales, since the injected energy is eventually\ndissipated more or less isotropically (see Heinz et al. 2006).\nTherefore, on large spatial scales, AGN heating can be approximated as supplying thermal energy alone (e.g. Pope\n2009; Fabjan et al. 2010) and it is reasonable to expect the\nheating/cooling system to be explicable by a relatively simple model. In terms of general expectations, radiative cooling\nfrom the hot gas is a positive feedback process - as energy\nis radiated, the gas loses pressure support, contracts and\nradiates at an accelerating rate. As a result, the N th time\nderivative, dN LX /dtN , must itself be related to LX (t), in\nsome way. Conversely, heating will cause the X-ray emitting\ngas to expand, thereby reducing its luminosity. With this\nin mind, and without making any unnecessary assumptions,\nsuppose that H(t) and LX (t) can be related by a continuous\ntime, linear, N -th order differential equation of the form\ndN LX\ndN\u22121 LX\n+ aN\u22121\n+ ...\nN\ndt\ndtN\u22121\nd2 LX\ndLX\n... + a2\n+ a1\n+ a0 LX = H(t).\ndt2\ndt\naN\n\n(1)\n\n1 Optimal control theory has a wide range of applications extending beyond engineering and finance to complex biological systems\nas well as physics. Astrophysically, optimal control theory is applied in adaptive optics, but does not appear to have been widely\nadopted in theoretical research, though Haggag & Safko (2003)\nemployed the approach to demonstrate a concise derivation of\nthe Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation of hydrostatic equilibrium.\n\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20137\n\n\fInvestigating a model of optimised AGN feedback\nNote that, in its present form, equation (1) is a generic description for the variation of the X-ray luminosity, LX (t),\nin response to an externally applied heating rate, H(t).\nHowever, heating rates derived from observations of X-ray\ncavities inflated by AGN seem to correlate with the Xray luminosity of the host cluster (e.g. B\u0131\u0302rzan et al. 2004;\nDunn & Fabian 2008), suggesting H(t) \u221d LX (t). Furthermore, Rafferty et al. (2008) (see also Cavagnolo et al. 2008)\nshowed that AGN in cluster centres seem to be activated\nwhen the central cooling time of the ICM is below \u2248 0.5 Gyr.\nFor this reason, we can express the heating rate as H(t) =\n\u03b1(t)k1 LX (t), where k1 is a constant of proportionality (the\nfeedback strength), and \u03b1(t) is a parameter which varies\nbetween 0 and 1 depending on the central cooling time.\nThe physical processes that govern how \u03b1(t) varies are\nhighly uncertain, as mentioned in the introduction. They relate to how material from the ICM reaches the black hole,\nand how the resulting energy output from the AGN outflow is dissipated in the surrounding medium. Rather than\ntrying to solve the gas physics explicitly, we can pose the\nproblem in a different way. From observations indicating recurrent discrete AGN outbursts (e.g. Best et al. 2005, 2007;\nShabala et al. 2008), we conclude that \u03b1(t) does vary and is\nprobably close to zero for a significant fraction of the time,\nbut also close to unity at other times. This suggests that\nAGN heating causes the central cooling time of the ICM\nto significantly overshoot the critical value of \u2248 0.5 Gyr. As\na result, it is clear that AGN heating influences \u03b1(t), and\n\u03b1(t) influences AGN heating. The crucial question then is:\nhow must \u03b1(t) be made to vary in order to explain the observed radio AGN duty cycles (e.g. Best et al. 2005, 2007;\nShabala et al. 2008)? One possible solution is obtained by\nemploying optimal control theory.\nFor convenience, equation (1) can be expressed in matrix form as a system of first order differential equations.\nThese describe the evolution of the state variables of the\nsystem (e.g. Fairman 1998), which are defined as q1 (t),\nq2 (t)....qN (t) where q1 = LX , q2 (t) = dLX /dt up to qN =\ndN\u22121 LX /dtN\u22121 . Therefore, the time derivatives of the state\nvariables are q\u03071 = q2 , q\u03072 = q3 up to q\u0307N = \u2212[aN\u22121 qN +\naN\u22122 qN\u22121 + a0 q1 \u2212 H(t)]/aN . The system can then be written compactly as\nq\u0307(t) = Aq(t) + BH(t),\nLX (t) = Cq(t),\n\nwhere q(t) is the column vector containing the state variables, q\u0307(t) is its time derivative and A is called the system\nmatrix. For a system that has m inputs and p outputs, and\nN state variables, A is an N \u00d7 N matrix, B is an N \u00d7 m matrix and C an p\u00d7N matrix. Therefore, for the case described\nabove B is a column vector and C is a row vector.\nThe most convenient way to express the feedback equation is to assume the control is linearly proportional to all of\nthe states of the system: H(t) = \u03b1(t)Kq(t), where K is the\nfeedback matrix - a row vector governing the strength of the\nfeedback (e.g. DiStefano et al. 1994). For a first order system K = [k1 ], while for a second-order system K = [k1 , k2 ],\nwhere k1 and k2 denote how the heating is coupled to LX\nand L\u0307X , respectively. To maintain generality, H(t) has been\nexpressed as a column vector so that it can, in principle, be\nrelated to any of the derivatives of LX (t) as well as LX (t)\nitself. However, it seems likely that only the primary couc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20137\n\npling constant, k1 , will be non-zero; as a result H(t) is only\nrelated to LX (t).\nBy assuming feedback control, equation (2) reduces to\nq\u0307(t) = [A + \u03b1(t)BK]q(t)\n\n(3)\n\nand is said to be controllable if the matrix K exists such\nthat it can yield any desired set of roots for the characteristic\npolynomial of the closed-loop system, |\u03bbI\u2212[A+\u03b1(t)BK]| =\n0 (e.g. DiStefano et al. 1994).\n\n3\n\nAGN FEEDBACK MODELS WITH\nADDITIONAL CONSTRAINTS\n\nThe aim of optimal control theory is to determine how the\ncontrol variable must be varied in order to minimise the\n'cost' associated with the constraint. The solutions are derived using the calculus of variations and are, therefore, optimal in the same sense as a solution of the Euler-Lagrange\nequations in classical mechanics; by this definition a natural system must reside in an 'optimal' state. As a result,\nthe behaviour of a system, if interpreted correctly, provides\nvaluable information about important constraints and the\nunderlying physical processes at work. In the present example, the control variable is \u03b1(t). Given that 0 6 \u03b1(t) 6 1,\nwe investigate how it should be varied to minimise the total\nenergy output of the system.\nAs described in the introduction, the motivation for\nthis choice of constraint is influenced by i) radio data (e.g.\nBest et al. 2005, 2007; Shabala et al. 2008) indicating that\nAGN heating may occur in discrete outbursts; ii) mass estimates of black holes in some Brightest Cluster Galaxies\n(e.g. Fujita & Reiprich 2004), which may be interpreted as\nhaving liberated insufficient accretion energy to have offset\nthe ICM X-ray luminosity over the lifetime of the host cluster. Below, we outline a model that exhibits features which\nare broadly similar to standard interpretations of these observations: AGN feedback which acts to minimise the total\nenergy output from the system (i.e. gas cooling + AGN heating) will balance gas cooling in the form of discrete heating\nevents, and in a way that minimises black hole growth.\n3.1\n\n(2)\n\n3\n\nOptimised AGN feedback\n\nIn this section, we use optimal control theory to determine\nhow \u03b1(t) should be varied in order to minimise the total energy output of the system. The method is somewhat mathematical, but the results are very general and there is no\nneed to make any assumptions about the particular mode\nof accretion, only that AGN heating is optimal with respect\nto the imposed constraint.\nIn optimal control theory (see Burghes & Downs 1975;\nKirk 2004, for example), the control must maximise the socalled objective function, J, which is written as\nZ t1\nJ=\nL[q(t), \u03b1(t)] dt,\n(4)\nt0\n\nwhere, L is the Lagrangian which quantifies the constraints\non the system and is a function of the state and control variables as shown. For a minimisation, the appropriate objective function is simply the the maximising objective function\nmultiplied by \u22121.\n\n\f4\n\nE.C.D. Pope\n\nThe Hamiltonian, F , of the system is generated by\nadjoining the system dynamics, f [q(t), \u03b1(t)], to the Lagrangian, such that\nF = y(t)f [q(t), \u03b1(t)] + L[q(t), \u03b1(t)],\n\n(5)\n\nwhere y(t) is called the costate vector, and is the dynamic\nequivalent of the Lagrange multipliers in static problems of\nmaximisation. From equation (3), the system dynamics can\nbe written f [q(t), \u03b1(t)] = q\u0307(t) \u2212 [A + \u03b1(t)BK]q(t).\nOptimal control theory also makes use of Pontryagin's maximum principle, which states that the optimal state q\u2217 (t), optimal control \u03b1\u2217 (t) and corresponding\ncostate vector y\u2217 (t), must maximise the Hamiltonian (e.g.\nBurghes & Downs 1975). Therefore, the condition for optimality is\n\u2202F\n= 0.\n(6)\n\u2202\u03b1\nFor a complete solution, it is also necessary to solve the\nEuler-Lagrange equations of the Hamiltonian\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202F\nd \u2202F\n\u2212\n=0\n(7)\n\u2202q\ndt \u2202 q\u0307\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd \u2202F\n\u2202F\n\u2212\n= 0.\n\u2202y\ndt \u2202 \u1e8f\nFull solutions can then be obtained by applying the appropriate boundary conditions, which depend on the specific\nproblem. In this case, it is assumed that the end time, t1 , and\nits corresponding state, LX (t1 ), are unknown. This requires\nan additional boundary condition, given by y1 (t1 ) = 0,\nwhere y1 is the first element of the costate vector. The initial\nX-ray luminosity is defined as LX (t0 ).\nThe minimum energy output constraint corresponds to\na Lagrangian of the form L[q(t), \u03b1(t)] = \u2212[1 + \u03b1(t)K]q(t).\nUsing this, the Hamiltonian must be\nF = \u2212[1+\u03b1(t)K]q(t)+y(t){q\u0307(t)\u2212[A+\u03b1(t)BK]q(t)}. (8)\nSince F is linear in \u03b1(t), it will be minimised when \u03b1(t) takes\nits largest value (if \u2202F/\u2202\u03b1 > 0), or its smallest possible value\n(if \u2202F/\u2202\u03b1 < 0) (e.g. Alexander 1996).\nMore specifically, for a first-order system (N = 1), dimensional analysis suggests a1 \u2248 \u2212\u03c4 , where \u03c4 is a characteristic cooling timescale, with a0 \u223c 1. Then, equation (6)\nyields\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u2202F\ny1 (t)\n= k1 LX (t)\n\u2212 1 = 0.\n(9)\n\u2202\u03b1\n\u03c4\nSince the terminal boundary condition for the costate variable is y1 (t1 ) = 0, equation (9) will be negative late in a\ngiven heating/cooling cycle. Thus, \u03b1(t) should optimally be\nzero in this limit. Earlier in the cycle, \u03bb(t) may be large\nenough to make \u2202F/\u2202\u03b1 > 0, in which case the optimal control is \u03b1(t) = 1 (e.g. Alexander 1996). This is a highly significant result for all Hamiltonians which are linear in the\ncontrol variable: the optimal control always lies on a boundary of the control set, but can switch from one boundary\npoint to the other - the so-called 'bang-bang' solution.\nEquation (6) will be satisfied when y1 (t\u2217 ) = \u03c4 , where t\u2217\ndenotes the time after the start of each cycle at which \u03b1(t)\nswitches from 1 \u2192 0. The value of t\u2217 is usually obtained by\nsolving equation (7), which itself yields a differential equation for the time-dependence of y1 . However, since the initial\n\nvalue of y1 (t0 ) is unknown, we must estimate t\u2217 by minimising the total energy output with respect to t\u2217 , using\nZ t1\n\u2202\n[LX (t) + H(t)] dt = 0.\n(10)\n\u2202t\u2217 t0\nFor this calculation, we require the complete solution for the\ntime-evolution of the X-ray luminosity of the gas, as outlined\nbelow.\nSince, \u03b1(t) is initially 1 and subsequently switches to 0,\nthere will be two distinct regimes per cycle; the AGN will\nbe active during the interval [t0 , t0 + t\u2217 ], but inactive during\nthe subsequent interval, [t0 + t\u2217 , t1 ]. Then, according to the\nboundary conditions, the solution must be\n\uf8f1\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\uf8f4\n(t\u2212t0 )\n\uf8f4\n,\nL\n(t\n)\nexp\n(1\n\u2212\nk\n)\n\uf8f4\nX\n0\n1\n\u03c4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nif t0 6 t < t0 + t\u2217\n\uf8f2\nLX (t) =\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n(t\u2217 +t0 )\n[t\u2212(t0 +t\u2217 )]\n\uf8f4\nL\n(t\n)\nexp\n(1\n\u2212\nk\n)\nexp\n,\n\uf8f4\nX\n0\n1\n\uf8f4\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nif t0 + t\u2217 6 t < t1 .\n\nSimilarly, the AGN heating rate is\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 k1 LX (t), if t0 6 t < t0 + t\u2217\nH(t) =\n\uf8f3\n0, if t0 + t\u2217 6 t < t1 .\n\nThen, substituting for LX (t) and H(t) in equation (10), we\nfind the optimal switching time to be t\u2217 = (t1 \u2212 t0 ) \u2212 \u03c4 ln 2.\nWithout making further assumptions, it is not possible to calculate the precise value of t\u2217 . However, in general terms, since AGN heating probably does not reduce\nthe X-ray luminosity by a large factor during each cycle,\nthe switching time should scale as t\u2217 \u223c \u03c4 /(k1 \u2212 1). Indeed,\nassuming that the AGN is re-triggered when the ambient\nconditions return to a state that is similar to the initial configuration (i.e. L(t1 ) \u2248 L(t0 )), a heating/cooling cycle will\nhave a duration t1 \u2212 t0 \u2248 \u03c4 k1 ln(2)/(k1 \u2212 1), and switching\ntime, t\u2217 \u2248 \u03c4 ln(2)/(k1 \u2212 1). Therefore, for optimal, periodic\nheating the duty cycle will be \u03b4 \u2261 t\u2217 /(t1 \u2212 t0 ) = 1/k1 .\nFigure 1 shows the time-evolution of the AGN heating\nrate and X-ray luminosity for this first-order heating/cooling\nsystem under the assumptions of periodic, optimal feedback.\nIn the figure, the feedback strength is k1 = 10, so that the\nduty cycle of AGN heating is \u03b4 \u2248 0.1.\nUnder the assumption of periodic heating, the energy\ninjected by the AGN each cycle is the same as the energy radiated by the gas. For optimal heating, this quantity is Eheat = Ecool = LX (t0 )\u03c4 k1 /[2(k1 \u2212 1)]. Thus,\nthe total energy produced each cycle, is Eout = Eheat +\nEcool = LX (t0 )\u03c4 k1 /(k1 \u22121). In addition, given that the timeaveraged AGN power output is rate is hHi = Eheat /(t1 \u2212t0 ),\nthe time-averaged black hole growth rate must be h\u1e40BH i =\nhHi/(\u03b7c2 ) = LX (t0 )/(\u03b7c2 ln 4), where \u03b7 is the standard accretion efficiency and c is the speed of light. During the\naccretion phase, the average accretion rate of the black hole\ngrowth rate is a factor k1 = 1/\u03b4 greater, and can be approximated by \u1e40BH = LX (t0 )/(\u03b4\u03b7c2 ln 4). Consequently, systems\nwith characteristically small duty cycles will experience brief\nphases of rapid black hole growth. In contrast, black hole\ngrowth in systems with duty cycles closer to unity will be\nmuch more uniform.\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20137\n\n\fInvestigating a model of optimised AGN feedback\n\ndimensionless cooling and heating rates\n\n10\n\n5\n\nLX(t)\nH(t)\n\n8\n6\n4\n2\n00.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n/\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n\u0001\n\nFigure 1. Two heating/cooling cycles of the X-ray luminosity, LX (t), and AGN heating rate, H(t), for a first-order, linear feedback\nsystem, subject to the minimum energy constraint. The values on the y-axis are given by LX (t)/LX (t0 ) and H(t)/LX (t0 ), while the\nx-axis is in units of the characteristic timescale of the system, \u03c4 . In this example, the feedback strength is k1 = 10, so that duty cycle is\n\u03b4 \u2248 0.1.\n\n4\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nObservationally, the radio AGN duty cycle is found to increase steeply with the stellar mass of the host galaxy (e.g.\nBest et al. 2005), and is higher still for Brightest Cluster\nGalaxies (Best et al. 2007). In the context of the model presented here, this suggests that the feedback strength decreases with increasing stellar mass.\nIf the argument above holds, the ratio of the instantaneous heating and cooling rates (H/LX = k1 ) will also\ndecrease with increasing stellar mass of the host galaxy.\nConsequently, lower mass systems must experience proportionally more powerful heating events. As a result, the momentum and energy supplied by the AGN would be much\nmore capable of expelling X-ray emitting material from the\ngravitational potential of an elliptical galaxy than a galaxy\ncluster. This scenario would appear to be consistent with\nrecent theoretical interpretations of the steepening of the\nLX \u2212 T relation below 1-2 keV (e.g. Puchwein et al. 2008;\nBower et al. 2008; Pope 2009).\nA plausible relationship between k1 and the average\ntemperature of the ambient gas, is as follows. When activated, the AGN heating rate is assumed to be proportional to the X-ray luminosity, such that H(t) = \u03b7 \u1e40BH c2 =\nk1 LX (t), where \u1e40BH is the black hole fuelling rate, and\nthe other quantities are as previously defined. The classical mass flow rate for an X-ray emitting atmosphere with\nluminosity LX (t), and average temperature T , is defined as\nLX = (5/2)kB T \u1e40clas /\u03bcmp , where kB is the Boltzmann constant and \u03bcmp is the mean mass per particle. Thus, if a\nfraction, \u03c6, of the classical mass flow rate reaches the supermassive black hole, we can write \u1e40BH = \u03c6\u1e40clas , and it can\nbe shown that k1 = 2\u03c6\u03b7\u03bcmp c2 /(5kB T ). Therefore, stronger\nfeedback (and smaller duty cycles) should be observed in\ncooler, less massive systems, as is consistent with standard\ninterpretations of radio AGN observations (Best et al. 2005,\n2007; Shabala et al. 2008).\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20137\n\nTo calculate a numerical value for k1 , we assume a\ncanonical accretion efficiency of \u03b7 = 0.1, which yields\nk1 = 1/\u03b4 \u2248 260(\u03c6/0.01)(T /107 K)\u22121 . For low mass elliptical\ngalaxies, Best et al. (2005) found \u03b4 \u223c 10\u22124 \u2212 10\u22123 which, in\nthe context of the present model suggests k1 \u223c 103 \u2212 104 .\nThus, for a characteristic X-ray temperature of T \u223c 106 K,\na value of k1 \u223c 103 \u2212 104 can only be obtained if \u03c6 \u223c 10\u22122 .\nIn contrast, the duty cycle of radio AGN activity in Brightest Cluster Galaxies is \u03b4 \u223c 0.1 \u2212 1 (e.g. Best et al. 2007),\nsuggesting that k1 \u223c 1 \u2212 10. Given that the typical X-ray\ntemperature in such systems is T \u223c 108 K, the fraction of the\nclassical cooling flow rate accreted by the black hole must\nbe \u03c6 \u223c 10\u22124 \u2212 10\u22123 .\nIf the reasoning outlined above approximates reality, we\nmight infer that the accreted fraction, \u03c6, tends to decrease\nin hotter (more spatially extended) systems. The simplest\nqualitative explanation for such a phenomenon is that the\nblack hole predominantly accretes material from the central\nregion of a galaxy or cluster. Therefore, the fraction of material accreted from the entire cooling flow will be governed\nby the size of this central region relative to the size of the\nregion within which the classical cooling flow rate applies.\n\n5\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe aim of this article has been to demonstrate how standard techniques optimal control theory can be used to investigate some of the fundamental characteristics of feedback\nwhich may be applicable to AGN heating in massive galaxies\nand galaxy clusters. Although it has not yet been possible\nto construct a completely satisfactory model for AGN heating, the application of optimal control theory has elucidated\nsome potentially important features of constrained feedback\nsystems. The main findings are described below.\n(i) Optimal control theory provides a way to impose addi-\n\n\f6\n\nE.C.D. Pope\n\ntional constraints on the system, with the minimum number\nof assumptions. In general terms, constraints are extremely\nuseful for conceptualising the interaction between the AGN\nand its environment and interpreting observational signatures. More specifically, we have shown that AGN heating\n(regulated by feedback) which acts to minimise the total\nenergy output of the system, occurs in the form of discrete,\nperiodic events. This constraint ensures that AGN heating\nbalances gas cooling with the minimum black hole growth\nand produces behaviour which is broadly compatible with a\nrange of observations. However, this is only one interpretation and explanation of the observations. In principle, there\nmay be other effects or constraints which achieve similar\noutcomes.\n(ii) The duty cycle for periodic AGN activity in a firstorder, linear feedback system is \u03b4 \u2248 1/k1 , where k1 is the\nfeedback strength. If this interpretation is applied to observations which show radio AGN duty cycles increasing\nwith the stellar mass of the host galaxy (Best et al. 2005,\n2007; Shabala et al. 2008), we would infer that the feedback\nstrength decreases as the system stellar mass increases. In\nturn, this would mean that AGN outbursts in lower mass\nsystems are proportionally stronger than those in more massive environments so that AGN heating events may be sufficiently powerful to expel hot gas from the gravitational potential of a galaxy, but not a galaxy cluster. A description\nof this sort is in qualitative agreement with recent theoretical explanations for the steepening of the LX \u2212 T relation\nfor temperatures below 1-2 keV (e.g. Puchwein et al. 2008;\nBower et al. 2008; Pope 2009).\n\n6\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe author would like to thank CITA for funding through\na National Fellowship.\n\nREFERENCES\nAlexander R., 1996, Optima for Animals.
