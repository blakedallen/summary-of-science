In conducting materials such as doped GaAs, the\nexternal electric field produces transport current and dissipation, even though the spin current transverse to it is\ndissipationless. Therefore it is highly desirable to design\nsystems showing the SHE without dissipation. Spin Hall\ninsulator (SHI) has been proposed for this purpose by\nsome of the present authors, and its candidate materials\nare HgTe, PbTe, \u03b1-Sn and so forth3 . These band insulators are predicted to show finite spin Hall conductivity\ns\n\u03c3H\n, which is not quantized and depends on parameters\nin the model Hamiltonian. Later it has been realized\nthat gapless edge modes in semi-infinite systems do not\nexist in generic cases. These two features, i.e., the nons\nquantized \u03c3H\nand the absence of gapless edge modes, are\nclosely related to the absence of conserved spin current\nin the presence of spin-orbit interaction, i.e., there is no\nU(1) gauge symmetry for spin current. Therefore it was\ndifficult to distinguish between the SHI and usual insulators.\nRecently, Kane and Mele proposed a model for timereversal (T-) invariant systems4,5 , which manifests a finite SHE and demonstrated its distinction from an ordinary insulator due to the topological nature of its ground\nstate. The pertinent Z2 topology is represented by an\ninteger \u2206 defined for Bloch wavefunctions in the bulk,\nwhose parity distinguishes the relevant phases. Physically, \u2206 is identical with the number of pairs of helical edge modes. In a system with \u2206 = odd, referred to\n\nas quantum spin Hall (QSH) system4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,13,14,15 ,\nthe odd number of pairs of helical edge modes is robust\nagainst weak nonmagnetic disorder and interactions16,17 .\nWhen \u2206 = even, gapless edge modes can hybridize each\nother and a gap will open even at the edge. The system\nis then referred to as spin Hall insulator (SHI). Transitions between phases with \u2206 = even (SHI) and \u2206 = odd\n(QSH) occur only when the gap is closed by tuning parameters of the model. Constructing a theory for analyzing these transitions is a challenge of paramount interest.\n\nIn this paper, we develop an effective continuum theory for phase transitions between QSH and SHI systems\nin 2D and discuss (i) classification of the possible types\nof transition, (ii) existence of gapless helical edge modes,\nand (iii) the change of the Z2 topological number at the\ntransition. The basic idea is that effective continuum theory focusing on the vicinity of the gap-closing points at\nthe transition can be constructed even though characterization of each phase requires information over the whole\nfirst Brillouin zone. Namely, the change across the phase\nboundary is much easier to elucidate, and the relation between the topological number and the helical edge modes\nis rather transparent. This work concerns local features\nin ~k space, and is complementary to Refs. 5,26, which\ntreats global topological structure in ~k space. We ignore\ninteraction and disorder effect in this paper, since the\nrobustness of the system is inferred from the topological\nstability.\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nGAP CLOSING AT THE PHASE\nTRANSITION\n\nSince the phase transition necessarily accompanies\nclosing of the gap5,9,10 , we commence with an analysis\nof generic gap-closing in a two-dimensional (2D) gapped\nspin-1/2 T-symmetric system with spin-orbit interaction.\nA Hamiltonian matrix for Bloch wavefunctions can be\nwritten in a block form,\n\u0013\n\u0012\nh\u2191\u2191 (~k) h\u2191\u2193 (~k)\n~\n.\n(1)\nH(k) =\nh\u2193\u2191 (~k) h\u2193\u2193 (~k)\nThe dimension of the matrix h\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 (~k) depends on systems\nconsidered; nevertheless, in order to describe the phase\ntransition, it is sufficient to restrict the dimension of the\nmatrices h\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 (~k) to be one or two, as we will see later.\nTo investigate the topological order of the Hamiltonian,\nits spectrum is assumed to have a gap, within which the\nFermi energy lies. The T-symmetry is represented by\nthe operator, \u0398 = i\u03c3y K (\u03c3x,y,z are Pauli matrices and\nK stands for complex conjugation). For H(~k) it implies,\nH(~k) = \u03c3y H T (\u2212~k)\u03c3y ,\n\n(2)\n\nor, equivalently, h\u2191\u2191 (~k) = hT\u2193\u2193 (\u2212~k) and h\u2191\u2193 (~k) =\n\u2212hT\u2191\u2193 (\u2212~k). This, in turn, results in a degeneracy between\nstates at ~k and \u2212~k, forming Kramers pairs.\nTuning some parameters in the Hamiltonian may drive\na transition, where the gap closes and degeneracies between the valence and the conduction bands occur at certain wavevectors ~k = (kx , ky ). To pursue the phase transition, we will focus on \"generic\" gap-closing achieved by\ntuning a single parameter m. (For mere convenience, the\ncritical value of m for which a generic gap-closing occurs\nis chosen as m = 0.) Non-generic gap-closing achieved by\ntuning several parameters are excluded in our analysis.\nThis is because such kind of gap-closing can be circumvented by small perturbation, meaning that it cannot be\nassociated with a phase transition. As we show below,\ngeneric gap-closing are classified into two cases shown\nschematically in Fig. 1 (a)(b) (depending on symmetry\nunder parity). We note that while we have not made any\nassumption on the Z2 topological number, both cases (a)\nand (b) turn out to encode quantum phase transitions between the QSH and the SHI phases. Among the known\nmodels describing this kind of phase transition, the KaneMele model on the honeycomb lattice5 falls within class\n(a) while the HgTe quantum well model18 belongs to class\n(b).\nThe QSH-SHI phase transitions pertaining to Fig. 1\n(a)(b) are not so trivial as it might look. In general,\nenergy levels repel each other, thereby the valence and\nthe conduction bands do not touch when the number of\ntuned parameters is not large enough. The number of\ntuned parameters to achieve degeneracy, called the codimension, is sensitive to the symmetry and the dimension\n\nof the system considered. For example, in three dimensions the gap-closing of the type (a) in Fig. 1 does not\noccur19 .\nConsider now a spatial inversion (I-)symmetry which\nplays an important role beside T-symmetry. The former requires the relation \u03b5n\u03b1 (~k) = \u03b5n\u03b1 (\u2212~k), while the\nlatter implies \u03b5n\u03b1 (~k) = \u03b5n\u1fb1 (\u2212~k), where \u03b5n\u03b1 (~k) is the\nenergy of band n with pseudospin \u03b1, and \u1fb1 is the pseudospin opposite to \u03b120 . If both symmetries are respected,\n\u03b5n\u03b1 (~k) = \u03b5n\u1fb1 (~k) and there is a Kramers double degeneracy at each ~k. If I-symmetry is broken, double degen~ i.e. ~k = ~ki \u2261 G/2,\n~\neracy occurs at points ~k = \u2212~k + G,\n~\nwhere G is a reciprocal lattice vector; no double degeneracy occurs at other points (unless an additional symmetry is present). The I-asymmetric and I-symmetric cases\nare therefore considered separately below.\nA.\n\nInversion asymmetric systems\n\n~ each band is nonIn this case, when ~k 6= \u2212~k + G,\ndegenerate, and the gap between two bands can close at\nsome points ~k. At the gap-closing point, one valence\nband and one conduction band become degenerate. The\ncodimension is three21 . This codimension three is equal\nto the number of parameters involved, that is, kx , ky and\nm. Thus the gap can close at some ~k when the parameter\nm is tuned to a critical value.\n~ the band is\nOn the other hand, when ~k = \u2212~k + G,\ndoubly degenerate, and the codimension is five22,23 , exceeding the number of tunable parameters which is one\n(that is, m). Thus, generic gap-closing cannot occur at\n~k = G/2\n~ 24 .\n~\nWe thus focus on the case ~k 6= G/2.\nNear the gap~\nclosing point ~k = ~k0 (6= G/2),\nthe system's Hamiltonian\ncorresponds to massive two-component fermion, and can\nbe expressed as H = m\u03c3z + (kx \u2212 k0x )\u03c3x + (ky \u2212 k0y )\u03c3y\n(after unitary and scale transformations). T-symmetry\nrequires that the gap closes simultaneously at ~k0 and \u2212~k0\nas depicted in Fig. 1 (a), and that the masses at ~k =\n\u00b1~k0 have opposite signs. In the honeycomb-lattice model\nfor QSH4,5 the gap closes at the K, K \u2032 points; Hence it\nreduces to the present scheme without I-symmetry.\nB.\n\nInversion symmetric systems\n\nIn this case, the energies are doubly degenerate at each\n~k. At the phase transition, the gap between the two\ndoubly-degenerate bands closes. Hence, we consider 4\u00d74\nHamiltonian matrix H(~k) (h\u03b1\u03b2 (~k) in Eq. (1) are 2\u00d72).\nThe I-symmetry is imposed as\nH(\u2212~k) = P H(~k)P \u22121 , u(\u2212~k) = P u(~k),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere P is a unitary matrix independent of ~k, and u(~k)\nis the periodic part of the Bloch wavefunction: \u03c6~k (~r) =\n\n\f3\nhave different parity. The Hamiltonian reads,\nH(~k) = a0 (~k) + a5 (~k)\u0393\u20325 +\n\n4\nX\n\nb(i) (~k)\u0393\u2032i\n\n(6)\n\ni=1\n\nFIG. 1: Generic gap-closing for (a) inversion-asymmetric and\n(b) inversion-symmetric cases. In case (b) all the states are\ndoubly degenerate by Kramers theorem.\n~\nu(~k)eik*~r . As the inversion does not flip spin, this unitary\nmatrix P should be block-diagonal in spin space:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nP\u2191\nP =\n.\n(4)\nP\u2193\n\nIn fact, all cases reduce to a case P\u2191 = P\u2193 = diag(\u03b7a , \u03b7b )\nwith \u03b7a = \u00b11, \u03b7b = \u00b11, as can be shown directly by\napplying a unitary transformation. \u03b7a and \u03b7b represent\nthe parity eigenvalues of the atomic orbitals.\nOccurrence of gap closing turns out to be different for\nthe cases (i) \u03b7a = \u03b7b and (ii) \u03b7a = \u2212\u03b7b . The case (i)\n\u03b7a = \u03b7b = \u00b11 is realized when the atomic orbitals a, b\nhave the same parity, such as two s-like orbitals or two plike orbitals. The ensuing constraints on the Hamiltonian\nare: h\u2191\u2191 = hT\u2193\u2193 is an even function of ~k, and h\u2191\u2193 = h\u2020\u2193\u2191\nis an antisymmetric matrix, even function in ~k. In an\nexplicit form, the generic Hamiltonian becomes\nH(~k) = E0 (~k) +\n\n5\nX\n\nai (~k)\u0393i\n\n(5)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere ai 's and E0 are real even functions of ~k. \u0393i are 4\u00d74\nmatrices given by \u03931 = 1 \u2297 \u03c4x, \u03932 = \u03c3z \u2297 \u03c4y , \u03933 = 1 \u2297 \u03c4z ,\n\u03934 = \u03c3y \u2297 \u03c4y , and \u03935 = \u03c3x \u2297 \u03c4y , where \u03c3i and \u03c4i are Pauli\nmatrices acting on spin and orbital q\nspaces, respectively.\nP5\n2\nThe Eigenenergies are given by E0 \u00b1\ni=1 ai . The gap\ncloses when ai (~k) = 0 for i = 1, * * * , 5. It means that the\n~\ncodimension is five, the same as in the case at ~k = G/2\nwithout I-symmetry. Thus there are no solutions of kx ,\nky and m which satisfy these five relations. The gap\nnever closes in this case.\nNext we consider the case \u03b7a = \u2212\u03b7b = \u00b11, i.e. P =\n\u03b7a \u03c4z = \u00b1\u03c4z , where the two constituent atomic orbitals\n\nwhere a0 (~k) and a5 (~k) are even functions of ~k, and b(i) (~k)\nare odd functions of ~k. Here \u0393\u2032i are 4 \u00d7 4 matrices given\nby \u0393\u20321 = \u03c3z \u2297 \u03c4x , \u0393\u20322 = 1 \u2297 \u03c4y , \u0393\u20323 = \u03c3x \u2297 \u03c4x , \u0393\u20324 = \u03c3y \u2297 \u03c4x ,\nand \u0393\u20325 = 1 \u2297 \u03c4z . In this case the gap closes only when\nfive equations a5 (~k) = 0, b(i) (~k) = 0 are satisfied. For a\n~\ngeneric point ~k with ~k 6= G/2,\nthese five equations cannot\nbe satisfied simultaneously, through a change of a single\nparameter25 . On the other hand, at the high-symmetry\n~\npoints ~k = ~ki = G/2,\nthe situation is different. At these\npoints the odd functions b(i) (~k) vanish identically, and\none has only to tune a5 (~k) to be zero. Thus, the gap\ncloses by fine-tuning a single parameter. To be more\nspecific, we take ~k = 0 as an example, and write down\n~\nthe Hamiltonian explicitly. Extension to other ~k = G/2\npoints is straightforward. The Hamiltonian is expanded\nto linear order in ~k as\nH(~k) \u223c E0 + m\u0393\u20325 +\n\n4 \u0010\n\u0011\nX\n\u03b2~ (i) * ~k \u0393\u2032i ,\n\n(7)\n\ni=1\n\n~ (i) (i = 1, * * * , 4)\nwhere E0 and m are constants, and \u03b2\nare two-dimensional real constant vectors. Further simplification is obtained after judicious unitary transformations. The Hamiltonian finally acquires the blockdiagonal form,\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nm z\u2212\n\uf8ec z \u2212m\n\uf8f7\nH(~k) = E0 + \uf8ed +\n.\n(8)\nm \u2212z+ \uf8f8\n\u2212z\u2212 \u2212m\nwhere z\u00b1 = b1 kx + b3 ky \u00b1 ib2 ky with real constants b1 ,\nb2 and b3 . Note that in materials with high crystallographic symmetry (e.g tetragonal), one has b1 = b2\nand b3 = 0, leading to z\u00b1 \u221d kx \u00b1 iky . We have thus\ndemonstrated a feature: The Hamiltonian of a generic\nsystem with spin-orbit coupling obeying T- and I- symmetries decouples, after an appropriate choice of basis,\ninto a pair of Hamiltonians describing two-component\nfermions with opposite sign of the corresponding mass\nterms. (Such decoupling is expected in the special case\nwhere sz is a good quantum number, since the system\ndescribes two copies of a quantum Hall system). Experimental consequences are immediate as the Hamiltonian\n(8) is equivalent to the one suggested for the HgTe quantum well in Ref. 18 (based on phenomenological arguments). Gap closing at ~k = 0 when the parameter m is\ntuned to zero\np is now obvious, since the eigenenergies are\nE = E0 \u00b1 m2 + z+ z\u2212 . The inversion matrix in this\nbasis is written as \u03b7a \u2297 \u03c4z = \u03b7a diag(1, \u22121, 1, \u22121).\nSumming up to this point, we discussed generic types\nof gap closing in time-reversal invariant systems, achieved\n\n\f4\nby tuning a single parameter. Taking I-symmetry into\nconsideration, two types of gap-closing scenarios have\nbeen found: (a) simultaneous gap closing at ~k = \u00b1~k0 6=\n~\nG/2\noccur in systems without I-symmetry, and (b) gap\nclosing between two Kramers-degenerate bands (i.e. four\n~\nbands) at ~k = G/2\noccur in systems with I-symmetry\n(see Fig. 1). Due to the level repulsion, the gap-closing\nby tuning a single parameter occurs only in limited cases.\nWe will see in the subsequent discussion that these cases\nof gap-closing exactly coincides with the phase transition between the QSH and the insulating phases. In this\nsense our theory characterizes the QSH phase from the\nlocal features in ~k space.\n\npoints, and N is the number of Kramers pairs below EF .\nIn the present case the gap at ~k = 0 collapses when m =\n0. Hence only the parity eigenvalue at ~k = 0 can change\nat the phase transition. Since the inversion matrix is\ngiven by P = \u03b7a \u2297 \u03c4z = \u03b7a \u03c30 \u2297 \u03c4z , the parity eigenvalues\nare \u2212\u03b7a (= \u03b7b ) and +\u03b7a for the lower-band states at m >\n0 and m < 0, respectively. Hence, the parity eigenvalue\nchanges sign, and the Z2 topological number \u2206 changes\nby one. Thus, on the two sides of the band touching,\nm > 0 and m < 0, one of the phases is the QSH phase,\nwhile the other one is the simple insulator (SHI) phase.\n\nIII.\nC.\n\nChange of the Z2 topological number at the\ngap-closing point\n\nNow we focus on the change of Z2 topological number at the gap closing, assuming that except for the gap\nclosing (m = 0) the bands are fully gapped. Hence, both\nphases at m > 0 and m < 0 are band insulators, and have\nwell-defined Z2 topological numbers. For the I-symmetric\ncase (a), the homotopy characterization in Ref. 26 is applicable; for the lower band at the critical value m = 0,\nthere is one vortex at ~k0 and one antivortex at \u2212~k0 . Thus,\nwhen the parameter m is tuned across m = 0, the Chern\nnumber for the whole contracted surface26 changes by\none. Thus, the Z2 topological numbers are different by\none for the m > 0 and the m < 0 sides. One of the phases\nis the QSH phase, while the other is the SHI. For the Isymmetric case (b), Fu and Kane13 developed a simple\nmethod to calculate the Z2 topological number \u2206 as\n(\u22121)\u2206 =\n\n4 Y\nN\nY\n\n\u03be2m (~ki ),\n\n(9)\n\ni=1 m=1\n\nwhere ~ki are the four high-symmetry points satisfying\n~k = G/2,\n~\n\u03be2m (ki ) is the parity eigenvalue at each of these\n\nLet us regard the usual insulating phase as our vacuum,\nso that the domain wall between the QSH phase and\nthe insulating phase is the edge of the sample. Such a\ndomain wall is described by a spatially dependent mass\nparameter m(x) satisfying m(\u00b1\u221e) = \u00b1m0 , i.e.,\nm=\n\n\u001a\n\nm0 : x \u226b 0\n\u2212m0 : x \u226a 0.\n\n(10)\n\nWe do not specify the detail of the crossover between m0\nand \u2212m0 , because it is not important for the subsequent\ndiscussions. For Fig. 1(a), one can consider the Weyl\nfermions at ~k = \u00b1~k0 separately. Masses of these Weyl\nfermions change sign at m = 0; hence they yield the\nedge states localized at the domain wall, as explained\nin Ref. 27. Because the Weyl fermions at ~k = \u00b1~k0 are\nrelated to each other by time-reversal symmetry, the two\nedge states form a Kramers pair.\nFor Fig. 1(b) with a domain wall (10), we follow the\ndiscussion in Ref. 27 to show that such domain wall between phases with different Z2 topological number possesses one Kramers pair of edge states at the boundary.\nIn this case we consider\n\nm\n\u2212ib1 \u2202x + (b3 \u2212 ib2 )ky\n\u2212m\n\uf8ec \u2212ib1 \u2202x + (b3 + ib2 )ky\nH\u0303(ky ) = E0 + \uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\nHELICAL EDGE STATES\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n.\nm\nib1 \u2202x \u2212 (b3 + ib2 )ky \uf8f8\nib1 \u2202x \u2212 (b3 \u2212 ib2 )ky\n\u2212m\n\nTo calculate the eigenstates it is convenient to perform unitary transformation as\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nb2 ky\nm \u2212 b1 \u2202x\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec m + b1 \u2202x \u2212b2 ky\n,\nH \u2032 (ky ) = Q\u2020 H\u0303(~k)Q = E0 + \uf8ed\n\u2212b2 ky m \u2212 b1 \u2202x \uf8f8\nm + b1 \u2202x\nb2 ky\n\n(11)\n\n(12)\n\nWe omit the term E0 henceforth, since it does not af-\n\nwhere\nQ=e\n\n\u2212ib3 ky x/b1\n\n1 1\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec i \u2212i\n.\n\uf8ed\n\u2212i \u2212i \uf8f8\n\u22121 1\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n(13)\n\n\f5\nfect the subsequent discussions. The eigenvalue problem\nreads as H \u2032 (ky )uky (x) = E(ky )uky (x).\nBecause (12) is block-diagonal, we first solve the eigenvalue problem for the first two components of uky , i.e we\nput uky = (u1 , u2 , 0, 0)t . We get\n(E \u2212 b2 ky )u1 = Du2 ,\n\n(14)\n\n(E + b2 ky )u2 = D\u2020 u1 ,\n\n(15)\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\nwhere D = m \u2212 b1 \u2202x\n, D\u2020 = m + b1 \u2202x\n. They yield\neigenequations for u1 and u2 , respectively:\n\nDD\u2020 u1 = (E 2 \u2212 b22 ky2 )u1 ,\n\u2020\n\n2\n\nD Du2 = (E \u2212\n\nb22 ky2 )u2 ,\n\n(16)\n(17)\n\nWhen we solve Eq. (16) for u1 , one can calculate u2 from\n(15). As (16) is invariant under E \u2192 \u2212E, it seems that\nthe solutions for E and \u2212E are always obtained simultaneously, namely there is a spectral symmetry between\nE \u2194 \u2212E. Nevertheless, it does not apply if E = \u2212b2 ky ,\nwhere (15) cannot be solved for u2 . A similar situation\noccurs for E = b2 ky . Thus exceptions at E = \u00b1b2 ky\noccur in the following way. For u1 (6= 0) which satisfies\nD\u2020 u1 = 0, we get E = b2 ky and u2 = 0 from Eqs. (14)\nand (15), whereas there is no solution with E = \u2212b2 ky .\nIn the same token, for u2 which satisfies Du2 = 0, we get\nE = \u2212b2 ky from (14), whereas there is no solution with\nE = b2 ky . Hence the spectral asymmetry is related to\nthe kernels for D and D\u2020 . For simplicity we take b1 > 0\nhenceforth, while the other case of b1 < 0 can be studied\nin a similar way. For the domain wall (10), the solution\nof D\u2020 u1 = 0 gives\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ x\n\u22121\nu1 \u221d exp \u2212b1\nm(s)ds\n(18)\n\nFIG. 2: Schematic dispersion curves for the model (11).\nKramers theorem guarantees that the crossing of two edge\nstates occur at ky = 0.\n\nSo far we have solved the eigenequation for the first\ntwo components. The lower two components of the wavefunction u is obtained from above by time-reversal operation (\u0398u(ky ) = i\u03c32 u(\u2212ky )\u2217 ). Therefore, the abovementioned edge state with E = b2 ky has a Kramers partner with E = \u2212b2 ky . The whole dispersion is shown\nin Fig. 2. Thus we have shown that the Kramers pair\nof edge states exists at the boundary between the two\nphases. They cross at ky = 0, as is guaranteed by the\nKramers theorem.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nA general framework is established for classifying phase\ntransitions between the quantum spin Hall and the insulator phases. For inversion-asymmetric systems, the\nphase transition accompanies a gap closing at ~k = \u00b1~k0\nwhich is not at the high-symmetry points. For inversion~ where\nsymmetric systems, the gap closes only at ~k = G/2\n~ is a reciprocal vector. All the known models exhibiting\nG\nphase transition between the two phases are special cases\nof this general classification framework.\n\nand E = b2 ky , while Du2 = 0 has no normalizable solution. Thus the energy dispersion in ky direction has a\nbranch E = b2 ky , which crosses the Fermi energy E \u223c 0.\nThis state is gapless, localized near x = 0.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis research is supported in part by Grant-in-Aid\nand NAREGI Nanoscience Project from the Ministry of\nEducation, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of\nJapan.
