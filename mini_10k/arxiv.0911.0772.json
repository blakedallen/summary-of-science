This effect might be useful\nfor quantum information [1] as well as for fundamental\nstudies of many-body physics and was observed in several\nexperiments [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. The coherence\nof the excitation process in a bulk gas has been experimentally demonstrated using an echo-technique [8, 9]:\nAfter exciting atoms to Rydberg states, it was possible\nto de-excite them following a \u03c0-phase shift of the excitation laser. The basic scheme is illustrated in Fig. 1.\nAfter the echo sequence, a certain fraction of the atoms\nremains in the excited state, owing to effects of the interaction. This has been modeled theoretically using the\nsuper-atom approach [12].\nNeither experiment nor theory has considered the dynamics of Rydberg-Rydberg correlations during such an\necho-sequence. Here, we show that strong correlations of\natoms separated by a characteristic distance r0 are induced in its course. This distance r0 is slightly larger\nthan the instantaneous blockade radius at the moment\nwhen the laser phase is flipped. At the instantaneous\nblockade radius rb (t) the Rydberg state density-density\ncorrelation function drops sharply to zero. Initially rb (t)\nequals zero, later growing towards its saturation value\nrb0 \u223c (C6 /\u03a9)1/6 , as the longer duration of the pulse allows an increasingly finer energy resolution.\nAfter most Rydberg atoms that were excited in the\nfirst half of the pulse returned to the ground state, the\nmajority of the remainder has their nearest excited neigh-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: sew654@pks.mpg.de\n\nbor at a distance between r0 and 1.5r0 . The strength of\nthis correlation signal is proportional to \u03c1\u22122 , where \u03c1 is\nthe atomic density.\n\nFIG. 1: Illustration of an echo excitation sequence and evolution of the Rydberg fraction. For a sequence of duration\nT , we use the fractional time \u03c4 = t/T . (a) Rabi frequency\n\u03a9w(t) [see section II A] during the sequence. (b) Fraction\nof excited state atoms, f , for a density \u03c10 Vb0 = 26.2 (solid)\nfrom a numerical solution of Schr\u00f6dinger's equation. Here,\n3\nVb0 = 4\u03c0rb0\n/3 is a simple estimate of the saturated blockade volume. We also show the non-interacting result for the\nexcited fraction (dashed). The symbols (\u2022) mark times for\nwhich we display correlations in Fig. 2.\n\nOur results imply that the echo technique can be used\nto manipulate the nearest-neighbor distribution in the\n\n\f2\nRydberg fraction of the gas. Such manipulations could\nbe used for example to initiate dynamics due to dipoledipole forces [13] from a well specified non-equilibrium\nstate.\nSimilar correlations between Rydberg atoms are created if a two-step excitation scheme with a strongly decaying intermediate state is used [14, 15]. In that case\nthey are due to the Autler-Townes splitting of the intermediate level.\nThe peculiar nature of the nearest neighbor distribution function of Rydberg atoms after an echo pulse could\nbe seen experimentally in the kinetic energy spectrum\nof ions after field ionization of the remaining Rydberg\nfraction. Alternatively one could measure deviations of\nthe atom counting statistics from a Poissonian distribution [16]. Both these suggestions are discussed further in\nsection IV.\nOur results are based on solutions of the many-particle\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation, which we also use to benchmark\nthe recently proposed \u03c9-expansion [17, 18]. Both methods are briefly described in section II. The ensuing correlation dynamics are presented in section III. Possible\nways to detect the pairing effect are discussed in section IV. In section V we take a closer look at the effects\nof density variations on our results and in section VI we\ndirectly compare many-body quantum simulations with\nthe \u03c9-expansion. Finally, we conclude in section VII.\n\ntakes the form:\n\uf8ee\n\ni\u010bn = \uf8f0\u2206\n\nN0\nX\n\nA.\n\nWe consider a system of N0 atoms at fixed locations xi ,\ndescribed by the following Hamiltonian in atomic units:\nN\n\n0\n1X\ni\ni\n\u0124 =\n\u03a9w(t)(\u03c3eg\n+ \u03c3ge\n)\n2 i=1\n\nN0\nX\ni=1\n\n\u03baij ni nj \uf8fb cn\n\nN\n\n+\n\n0\n1X\n(\u03a9w(t)cn,\u2193i + \u03a9\u2217 w\u2217 (t)cn,\u2191i ) ,\n2 i\n\n(2)\n\nwhere cn,\u2193i (cn,\u2191i ) is the coefficient of the state that is\nreached from |ni by lowering (raising) the i'th atom if\nthis is possible, and 0 otherwise.\nFor the numerical solution we convert Eq.

[19, 20]). We furtherP\nlimit the number of simultaneously excited atoms to\nnj \u2264 Nmax .\nAll numerical results are checked for convergence with\nrespect to variations of Nmax and Ecut .\n\nThe \u03c9-expansion\n\nMETHODS\n\nExact quantum dynamics\n\n+\u2206\n\n\uf8f9\n\ni,j;i>j\n\ni\n\nB.\nII.\n\nni +\n\nN0\nX\n\ni\n\u03c3ee\n+\n\nN0\nX\n\ni\nj\n\u03baij \u03c3ee\n\u03c3ee\n.\n\n(1)\n\ni,j;j>i\n\nEach atom can either be in its ground state |gi or an\nexcited state |ei, the Rydberg state. The atoms in |ei\nexperience long range interactions \u03baij = \u2212C6 /|xi \u2212 xj |6 .\nLaser induced transitions between the levels occur with\nRabi-frequency \u03a9 \u2208 R, detuning \u2206 and the temporal\ni\ni\nprofile of the pulse w(t). The operators \u03c3ab\nact as \u03c3ab\n=\n|aihb| on the subspace of atom i and as unity on others.\nWe use atomic units unless otherwise indicated.\nPWe expand the many-body wave function as |\u03a8(t)i =\nn cn |ni, where n is a vector with N0 elements nj \u2208\n{0, 1} which describe whether atom j is in the ground\n(0) or excited (1) state. Schr\u00f6dinger's equation (SE) then\n\nIn the experiment [8], the sign of the Rabi-coupling\nwas flipped well before the excitation of Rydberg atoms\nreached the saturation limit imposed by the blockade effect. In such a situation one could attempt to solve the\nquantum dynamics of the gas by a series expansion in\n\u03c9 = \u03a9t [17], where \u03c9 = 0.25 for the experimental conditions.\nFrom Eq. (1), we can derive equations of motion for\ni\nthe operators \u03c3ab\n. We expand these operators in a seP n i(n)\ni\nries \u03c3ab = n \u03c9 \u03c3ab . It is possible to obtain recursive\ni(n)\ni(m)\nequations expressing \u03c3ab by \u03c3a\u2032 b\u2032 for m < n. In our\ni\ncase the lowest order approximations of the \u03c3ab\nalready\noffer interesting insight into correlation dynamics.\nIn the following we are interested in an echo-type pulse.\nAssuming a pulse-length T , we rescale our variables\n\u03c4 = t/T,\n\n\u03c9 = \u03a9T,\n\nkij = \u03baij T,\n\nf (\u03c4 ) = w(t/T ).

We further define F (\u03c4 ) = 0 d\u03c4 \u2032 f (\u03c4 \u2032 ) =\n\u03c4 \u0398(1/2 \u2212 \u03c4 ) + [1 \u2212 \u03c4 ]\u0398(\u03c4 \u2212 1/2).\nAccording to the \u03c9-expansion the leading- (LO) and\nnext-to-leading- (NLO) order expressions for the excited\n\n\f3\ncase\nN0\nL/rb0\n\u03c1g (r)\n\u03c10 Vb0\n\u03c10 /1010 [cm\u22123 ]\n\n(i) (ii) (iii)\n20\n2.5\n\u03c10\n5.4\n1.3\n\n84\n2.38\n\u03c10\n26.2\n6.3\n\n(iv)\n\n125\n50\n2.38\n2.38\n\u03c10 \u03c10 exp [\u22122r 2 /\u03c3 2 ]\n39\n26.2\n9.4\n6.3\n\nTABLE I: Parameters for the scenarios modeled in this article.\nIn cases (i)-(iii) the atoms are homogeneously distributed in a\ncubic box of side-length L with periodic boundary conditions\n[21].

Throughout the paper we write \u03c1 for the full density\nprofile and \u03c10 for the peak density. If we evaluate Eq. (6)\nat t = T for a homogeous system, we can obtain the echo\nsignal, i.e. the final Rydberg fraction\np\n\u0011\n2\u03c9 4 \u03c0 3/2 |C6 | \u0010 \u221a\n8 2 \u2212 9 \u03c10 .\nfe = Pe (T ) =\n(11)\n2835\nOther analytical expressions that can be obtained are\nnot illuminating and hence omitted here. However, we\n\nCORRELATION DYNAMICS\n\nFor N0 atoms, homogenously distributed in a cube of\nvolume L3 , we can see that the physics of our problem\nis governed by two parameters, namely \u03c9 = \u03a9T and\nU = C6 T /L6 . Throughout this paper we usually employ \u03c9 = 0.25 and U = \u22120.0014. This corresponds, for\nexample, to a 87 Rb gas in which states with principal\nquantum number nRyd = 41 are excited via a transition\nwith Rabi-frequency \u03a9 = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 0.1 MHz during a time of\n400 ns. The side-length of the box would be L = 11\u03bcm.\nFor these parameters we then vary the number of atoms\nas listed in table I, leading to densities of the order of\n5 \u00d7 1010 cm\u22123 . Compared to the experiment [8], these\nparameters lead to a substantially weaker blockade with\nmaximally about Nb = 40 atoms per blockade-sphere.\nThis facilitates both, the physics of interest here and the\nnumerical simulation. We will use the saturated twoatom blockade radius rb0 = (C6 /\u03a9)1/6 as length scale\nand express densities using the simple estimate for the\n3\nblockade volume Vb = 4\u03c0rb0\n/3.\nIn an echo-sequence, we first excite Rydberg states\nwith Rabi-frequency \u03a9 for some duration \u03c4 /2, followed\nby a \u03c0-phase shift of the laser and hence Rabi coupling\n\u2212\u03a9 for further time \u03c4 /2. These parameters are defined\nin section II B. For the full quantum dynamics as in section II A, we randomly distribute N0 atoms, solve the SE\nand obtain one correlation function defined by Eq. (9)\nfor each pair of atoms. These are binned according to\nthe separation r of those atoms. To minimize finite size\neffects, we only consider atoms (pairs) inside a central\ncube of side length L/2 within our simulation volume to\ncalculate Ne (g (2) ).\nIn order to obtain a spatial correlation function, we\nfirst calculate g (2) (i, j) according to Eq. (9) for each of\nthese atom pairs. We then determine\nX\u0304 (2)\ng (2) (r) =\n(13)\ngi,j /N (r),\ni,j\n\nP\u0304\n\nwhere\ni,j denotes a double sum over all atoms that\nfulfill |xi \u2212 xj | \u2208 [r, r + \u2206r) for a bin size \u2206r, and N (r)\n\n\f4\ntance r. Let us write the quantum state of this pair as\n|\u03a8i = cgg |g1 g2 i + ceg |e1 g2 i + cge |g1 e2 i + cee |e1 e2 i.\n(14)\nOnly in the state |e1 e2 i where both atoms are excited to\na Rydberg level do they experience any interaction. The\ncorrelation function in state (14) is\ng (2) (1, 2) \u2261\n=\n\nFIG. 2: (color online) Spatial atomic correlations during an\necho sequence with \u03c10 Vb0 = 5.4.

Below the cutoff length rcut ,\ng (2) is set to zero [21].

(d) Spatial maximum of pair correlations. The\nlocation of the time-samples in (a-c) relative to the pulse can\nbe seen clearly in Fig. 1.\n\nis the number of atom pairs that fall into each respective\nbin.\nThus averaging over the whole sample and further over\na large number of realizations of the spatial atomic distribution [22], we obtain a spatial correlation function\ng (2) (r). Our results from numerical solutions [21] of\nEq. (2) are shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.\nSoon after initiating a transfer of atoms to the Rydberg state, the probability to find a pair of excited atoms\ncloser than the sharply defined instantaneous blockade\nradius rb (t) is essentially zero. This is due to strong vander-Waals interactions of those pairs, shifting doubly excited states out of resonance. The radius rb (t) grows in\ntime, since the longer pulse duration allows an increasingly finer energy resolution. The Rydberg atom number\nin the echo-sequence does not reach the saturation limit,\nhence rb (t) does not reach its equilibrium extension (rb0 )\nbut continues to grow throughout the excitation period\n[Fig. 2, panel (a)]. Following the flip of the phase of the\nRabi-coupling at \u03c4 = 0.5, g (2) develops a dominant peak\njust outside the blockade radius [panel (b)]. The height\nof this peak increases as more and more atoms are transferred back to the ground state [panel (d)]. Just before\nthe end of the pulse, for densities as low as in Fig. 2, a\ndip appears in the correlation peak like that shown in\npanel (c). This feature starts to occur at the time when\nthe probability for a single excitation in the system drops\nbelow that for double excitation.\nThe underlying physics requires only binary interaction: Consider a pair of atoms separated by some dis-\n\n1\n2\nh\u03c3ee\n(\u03c4 )\u03c3ee\n(\u03c4 )i\n1 (\u03c4 )ih\u03c3 2 (\u03c4 )i\nh\u03c3ee\nee\n\n|cee |2\n.\n(|ceg |2 + |cee |2 )(|cge |2 + |cee |2 )\n\n(15)\n\nNow consider g (2) after the pulse for three different\natomic separations: (i) If the atoms are very close\nr . rb (t) double excitation can be considered fully suppressed. Hence |cee | = 0 and g (2) = 0. (ii) If the atoms\nare very far apart the interaction can have no effect. We\nknow then g (2) = 1. From Eq. (15) this can be understood since without interactions and for small excited\nfractions |cee | \u2248 |ceg |2 = |cge |2 and |ceg |2 \u226b |cee |2 . (iii)\nIn the intermediate range we can neither neglect double excitations nor interaction. Consider the very end of\nthe pulse: The amplitudes ceg and cge have returned to\ntheir initial value of zero after the echo-pulse. In contrast\n|cee | is non-zero due to the dephasing. We then see that\nthe atomic correlation function scales as g (2) = 1/|cee |2 ,\nwhich is larger than one.\nAs shown in Fig. 2, the distances r with pairing correlations during the second half of the pulse are those\nwhere correlations change, as r increases, from blockaded\n(g (2) = 0) to uncorrelated (g (2) = 1) during the first half\nof the pulse. We will call the spherical shell around each\natom where neighbors have these distances the partial\nblockade shell.\nWe find that the position of the maximum of the correlation function during the second half of the pulse depends only weakly on time.\n\nIV.\n\nSIGNATURES OF PAIRING\n\nIn this section we quantify to what extent the correlation dynamics presented in the previous section allows\ncontrol over the nearest neighbor distribution in a Rydberg gas. We further discuss observables that are easier\naccessible experimentally than the density-density correlations themselves.\nWe consider the fraction R of excited atoms separated\nfrom their nearest neighbor by a distance in the interval\n[r0, r0 + d], chosen to contain the peaks in Fig. 2 (a). This\nis given by\nR=\n\nP\n\nn6=0\nP\n\n|cn |2 f (n)\n\nn6=0 |cn |\n\n2\n\n,\n\n(16)\n\n\f5\n\nFIG. 3: Visibility of the pairing effect for a density with\n\u03c1Vb0 = 26.2. (a) Mandel-Q parameter. (b) Fraction R of remnant atoms within the preferred distance peak, using Eq. (16).\n(c) Total number of paired, excited atoms, extrapolated [23]\nas if there was a total number of Ng = 1 \u00d7 107 atoms initially.\n\n(ii) The Q-factor captures only integrated properties of\nthe correlation function. To obtain information about the\nspatial shape of atomic correlations after an echo pulse,\nthe paired Rydberg atoms could be field ionized. The\npotential energy of the ions due to Coulomb repulsion\nEcoul \u2248 e2 /r0 4\u03c0\u01eb0 would subsequently be converted into\nkinetic energy. Since only a small number of atoms occupies Rydberg states, one could hope that the Rydberg\nfraction is sufficiently dilute for Coulomb-scattering to\nleave the initial kinetic energy distribution essentially unchanged. The peak in the nearest-neighbor distribution\nfunction \u223c r2 g (2) (r) then translates into a well visible\nmaximum of the measured kinetic energy spectrum of\nthe ions. For \u03c1Vb0 = 26.2 the energy at the maximum is\n0.5 meV.\nV.\n\nwhere f (n) is the fraction of excited atoms in the manybody basis state |ni with at least one excited neighbor\nin the chosen interval.\nFor a situation as in Fig. 2 we choose r0 = 0.5rb0\nand d = 0.25rb0 . We show in Fig. 3 (b) that almost\nall atoms are paired up before the end of the pulse. In\nthe initial phase, R remains nearly zero owing to the\npredominance of single excited atoms without neighbor.\nIn panel c we show the total number of paired, excited\natoms, obtained by multiplying the paired fraction R(t)\nwith the Rydberg-number Ne (t). We then rescale the\nobtained number corresponding to a total initial number of 107 atoms for illustrative purposes. It may seem\ncounter-intuitive that the number of paired atoms rises\neven during the second half of the pulse when atoms are\npredominantly deexcited. Note however, that whether or\nnot the Rabi-coupling causes excitations or de-excitations\ndepends on the relative populations and phases. The\ncontinuous increase of RNe (t) is again due to interaction\ninduced decoherence.\nFinally we describe two possibilities to experimentally\ndetect the correlation dynamics: (i) Via the effect of correlations on the number uncertainty in the Rydberg fraction [16] and (ii) via field ionization of the paired Rydberg\natoms.\n(i) Strong deviations from an uncorrelated state have\nbeen shown to affect the number statistics of the excited\nstate fraction [7, 16]. This is well captured in the MandelQ parameter [24]\nQ=\n\nhN\u0302e2 i \u2212 hN\u0302e i2\nhN\u0302e i\n\n\u22121=\n\nZ\n\nd3 r\u03c1e (r)[g (2) (r) \u2212 1], (17)\n\nwhich can be experimentally determined from the Rydberg atom counting statistics. We show the Q-factor in\nFig. 3 (a). In comparison with the evolution of R, we\nsee that the Q-factor becomes large when most Rydberg\natoms are paired up. Q \u223c 1 already represents a sizable deviation of the atom statistics from a Poissonian\ndistribution.\n\nVARYING THE SPATIAL ATOMIC\nDISTRIBUTION\n\nThe scenarios shown in the previous section are relatively weakly blockaded and assume a homogeneous distribution of atoms. In this section we study how an inhomogeneous distribution and changes of the overall density affect our results. The basic picture is shown in Fig. 4\nand Fig. 5. In Fig. 4 we compare a variety of different\ndensities. Prominent features of this data are compared\nmore directly in Fig. 5.\nIs is known that the echo-signal, i.e. the fraction of Rydberg excitations remaining after the pulse, increases as\nthe density is increased [8]. Using the \u03c9-expansion, we\ncan supply the analytical expression Eq. (11) for this increase. For the low densities where it is valid, it performs\nwell as can be seen in Fig. 5 (a). Other effects of increasing density are a decrease of the maximum correlations\nand an increase of the Mandel-Q factor for intermediate\ntimes (\u03c4 \u223c 3/4). Despite the decrease of the correlation\npeak height, we find that the paired fraction R, defined\nby Eq. (16) almost reaches unity after the pulse, regardless of the density. This is shown in Fig. 4 (e). We also\nshow the development of the dip in the correlation peak\nin Fig. 4 (f). We only see this feature for the lowest\ndensities considered.\nThe reduction of correlation strength with increasing\ndensity can be understood from the nature of the distribution of excitations near the end of the pulse, using\nonly classical arguments. Let us assume a homogenous\ndistribution of pairs of excited atoms within a volume\nV , with a fixed distance r0 between the partners of each\npair. The distance r0 then corresponds to the location of\nour pairing peak, ignoring its finite width. The orientation of pairs in space shall be isotropic. Overall we thus\nhave a distribution of positions for each pair:\nf (R, r) =\n\n1\n\u03b4(|r| \u2212 r0 ).\n4\u03c0V\n\n(18)\n\nHere, R denotes the centre-of-mass position of a pair and\nr its relative co-ordinate. Assuming a total number of M\n\n\f6\n\nFIG. 4: (color online) Effects of inhomogeneities and changes of density on the pairing peak. We show densities \u03c10 Vb0 = 5.4, 26.2,\n39 in (black, blue, green) respectively, and an inhomogeneous case \u03c1(x) = \u03c10 exp [\u22122r 2 /\u03c3 2 ] with \u03c10 Vb0 = 26.2 and \u03c3/rb0 = 1.6\n(red-dashed). (a) Rydberg fraction fe , for increasing homogeneous density the final remnant fe (\u03c4 = 1) gets larger. (b) Paired\nexcited fraction according to Eq. (16). (c) Mandel-Q parameter, see Eq. (17). (d) Spatial maximum of pair correlations. (e)\ng (2) (r) at \u03c4 = 0.75, for increasing homogeneous density, the peak height decreases. (f) Spatial atomic correlations near the\nend of an echo-pulse in a low density (\u03c10 Vb0 = 5.4) gas. Shown are snapshots at \u03c4 = 0.96, \u03c4 = 0.98, and \u03c4 = 1.0 in order of\nincreasing peak-height.\n\npairs we have a pair density np = M/V and an excited\natom density ne = 2M/V . The positions of the pairs\nthemselves are correlated due to the dipole blockade, we\nthus assume that the centers of the pairs must be separated by more than a certain radius rb . The classical\ncorrelation function corresponding to our g (2) is\n\u1e21 (2) (r) =\nZ\nE(r1 = x0 ; r2 = x0 + y, |y| = r)\n.\nd\u03a9\nE(r1 = x0 )E(r2 = x0 + y, |y| = r)\n\n(19)\n\nIn the numerator we have the expectation value for the\nnumber of joint occupations of the locations r1 and r2 by\nexcited atoms. In the denominator E(r1 = x0 ) denotes\nthe expectation value for the number of excited atoms at\nlocation x0 , which is 2M/V . The integration d\u03a9 is over\nthe solid angle of orientations of y with respect to x0 .\nWe are now interested exclusively in the value of the correlation function at the pairing peak, located at r = r0 .\nFor simplicity we assume contributions to the numerator of Eq. (19) stem only from cases where the atoms at\nboth locations were constituents of the same pair. This\nshould be justified when the pairs are sufficiently dilute\nthat their mean distance is much larger than r0 . We\ncan then write E(r1 = x0 ; r2 = x0 + y, |y| = r) =\nM f ((r1 + r2 )/2, r1 \u2212 r2 ).\nWith these simplifying assumptions, we find Eq. (19)\nequals V /4M \u223c 1/np for the simple pair distribution\ndescribed above. Using np \u223c ne , ne = fe \u03c1 and fe \u223c \u03c1\n\nfrom the \u03c9-expansion, we find overall that the correlation\nstrength scales like \u03c1\u22122 . This behavior is roughly confirmed by the simulation results as shown in Fig. 5 (b). It\nis consistent with a paired fraction R that shows almost\nno density dependence near the end of the pulse: For\nR r +d\neach excitation we calculate N = r00 r2 g (2) (r)ne (r)dr\nto obtain the number of excited neighbors in an interval [r0 , r0 + d]. Since ne scales like \u03c12 , while g (2) scales\nlike \u03c1\u22122 , we can understand how the final paired fraction\ncan remain almost the same even though the density is\nvaried.\nWe verified that the relation g (2) (r0 , \u03c4 ) \u223c \u03c1\u22122 remains\nqualitatively unchanged if we model similar echo-pulses\nin a fictitious system with a 1/r4 long range interaction.\nThis lends further support to the simple explanation in\nterms of the density of available pairs.\nNow consider a case with N0 = 50 atoms inhomogeneously distributed with atomic density \u03c1(x) =\n\u03c10 exp [\u22122r2 /\u03c3 2 ] [case (iv) in table I]. The peak-density\n\u03c10 is chosen as for case (ii). Fig. 4 includes the correlation function averaged over all atomic pairs in the\ncloud for this case. It is determined in the same manner\nas described in section III. One could expect that the\ninhomogeneity washes out the signal in the correlation\nfunction. Instead its visibility is even better than for the\nhomogenous case with equal peak-density, owing to the\npresence of low density regions in the atomic cloud. For\nlower density the pairing effect is more prominent as we\n\n\f7\nthe most dramatic correlation dynamics through an echo\npulse, those with a low density, the \u03c9-expansion provides\nuseful results.\n\nVII.\n\nFIG. 5: (color online) Dependence of echo signal and final correlation peak on atomic density. (a) Final Rydberg fraction at\nt = T . These datapoints are very well described by Eq. (11).\n(b) (H) Peak height of g (2) at t = T . The (red-dashed) curved\nshows the functional form g (2) (\u03c1) = [\u03c10 /\u03c1]2 g (2) (\u03c10 ) with reference density \u03c10 = 26.2. This is motivated by a simple model\nexplained in the text.\n\nalready argued. We also do not expect a strong spatial\nvariation of the preferred distance throughout the cloud,\nsince the blockade radius rb (t) depends only weakly on\nthe atomic density (i.e. the saturated many-body block2/5\nade radius scales like r\u0304b \u223c \u03c1g \u03a9 [6]). Hence the location\nof the correlation peak, situated near rb (\u03c4 /2), is expected\nto vary only little throughout the sample. Consequently\nthere are only small effects of spatial averaging on the final result in the inhomogenous case considered here. To\nfully exclude that density inhomogeneities in an experiment would suppress the signature reported here, one\nideally should consider a sample whose width greatly exceeds the characteristic range where the correlation peak\nis formed (\u03c3 \u226b r0 ). This is however computationally\nintractable.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have shown that an echo-type excitation sequence\nas employed in the experiments [8, 9] can be used to create Rydberg gases with non-standard nearest neighbordistribution functions. After the pulse the vast majority\nof excited atoms possesses a neighbor in a fairly narrow interval around some distance r0 . Variations of the\ninteraction-strength and pulse-length can control r0 . The\nstrength of the correlation signal is proportional to \u03c1\u22122 ,\nwhere \u03c1 is the atomic density. This can be understood\nin terms of the quantum state after the echo-pulse, independent of the precise form of the interaction.\n\nCOMPARISON WITH \u03c9-EXPANSION\n\nThe simple expression Eq. (10) for two-body correlations in the \u03c9-expansion does not depend on density and\nhence cannot capture its effect on correlation dynamics\nas shown in Fig. 4. However, for small densities it compares quite well with the substantially more involved exact Schr\u00f6dinger evolution. This can be expected from\nEq. (12): For Nb = 40, the series is well described by its\nfirst two terms until \u03a9t = 0.25.\nWe can see in Fig. 6 (a) and Fig. 5 (a) that the NLO\nresult for the Rydberg fraction [Eq. (6)] gives good quantitative results for the cases considered here. For correlations, we only have the LO expression Eq. (10). We\nsee that this approximation describes correlations in the\nlow density case \u03c10 Vb0 = 5.4 quite well, while quantitative deviations appear, once the density becomes as high\nas in the case with \u03c10 Vb0 = 26.2. Near the very end of\nthe pulse also qualitative differences in the shape of the\ncorrelation function are present, since Eq. (10) cannot\ndescribe the dip seen in Fig. 4 (f).\nWe note that in particular for the cases that show\n\nFIG. 6: (color online) Comparison of the \u03c9-expansion (reddashed) with exact solutions of the SE for \u03c10 Vb0 = 5.4 (solid\nblack) and \u03c10 Vb0 = 26.2 (solid blue). (a) Excited state fractions. (b) Pair correlation function g (2) (r) at \u03c4 = 0.49. (d)\nPair correlation function g (2) (r) at \u03c4 = 0.6 and \u03c4 = 0.75. The\nlater time has a higher pairing peak. For \u03c4 = 0.6 we used the\nsame color scheme as in the other panels, for \u03c4 = 0.75 the \u03c9expansion result is (magenta-dashed) and the exact solution\nis (solid green). (c) Spatial maximum of pair correlations.\n\nThe described pairing effect in the density-density correlation function is most pronounced for low densities and\nnot too strongly blockaded gases. However the overall\nfraction of Rydberg atoms that have a neighbor near the\ndistance r0 approaches unity regardless of density. Our\nresults were obtained by direct simulation of ensembles\nof about a hundred atoms. Further we used these simulations to estimate the range of validity of the first order\napproximation of the correlation dynamics obtained using the \u03c9-expansion. We find that for weakly blockaded\ngases it provides useful estimates.\n\n\f8\nAcknowledgments\n\nPD was supported by the European Community under\nthe contract MEIF-CT-2006-041390.\n\n[1] M. D.

This assumes that the simulated cube\ngives a representative sample of the dynamics of a large\nhomogenous atomic gas.\n[24] L. Mandel, Opt. Lett. 4, 205 (1979).\n\n\f"}
