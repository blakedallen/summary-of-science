Sellgren2\nDepartment of Astronomy, Ohio State University, 140 West 18th Avenue, Columbus, OH 43210;\njin@ast.cam.ac.uk, sellgren@astronomy.ohio-state.edu\n\narXiv:astro-ph/0307416v1 23 Jul 2003\n\nABSTRACT\nWe present a new 0.\u2032\u2032 9 resolution 3.29 \u03bcm narrowband image of the reflection nebula NGC 7023. We find\nthat the 3.29 \u03bcm infrared emission feature (IEF) in NGC 7023 is brightest in narrow filaments northwest of the\nilluminating star HD 200775. These filaments have been previously seen in images of extended red emission,\nK \u2032 , near-infrared H2 emission lines, the 6.2 \u03bcm and 11.3 \u03bcm IEFs, and HCO+ . We also detect 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission faintly but distinctly between the filaments and the star. The 3.29 \u03bcm IEF image is in marked contrast to\nnarrowband continuum images at 2.09 \u03bcm, 2.14 \u03bcm, and 2.18 \u03bcm, which show an extended emission peak midway between the filaments and the star, and much fainter emission near the filaments. The [2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm]\ncolor shows a wide variation, ranging from colors of 3.4-3.6 mag at the 2 \u03bcm continuum emission peak to a\ncolor of 5.5 mag in the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission filaments. A color of 5.5 mag is 1 mag higher than any published\nvalue in reflection nebulae. We observe [2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] to increase smoothly with increasing projected\ndistance from the illuminating star in NGC 7023, up until the brightest 3.29 \u03bcm IEF filament, suggesting that the\nmain difference between the spatial distributions of the 2 \u03bcm continuum and the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission is related\nto the incident stellar flux. The 3.29 \u03bcm IEF is widely attributed to an aromatic C H stretch, while the 2 \u03bcm\ncontinuum emission may be due to transient heating of tiny grains, fluorescence of aromatic molecules, or photoluminescence of larger grains. Our results suggest that the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF carriers are likely to be distinct from,\nbut related to, the 2 \u03bcm continuum emitters. Our finding also imply that, in NGC 7023, the 2 \u03bcm continuum\nemitters are mainly associated with H I, while the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF carriers are primarily found in warm H2 , but that\nboth the 2 \u03bcm continuum emitters and the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF carriers can survive in H I or H2 .\nSubject headings: infrared: ISM - dust - reflection nebulae - ISM: individual (NGC 7023) - ISM:\nmolecules\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe 3.29 \u03bcm infrared emission feature (IEF), discovered in the planetary nebula NGC 7027 (Merrill, Soifer, & Russell\n1975), is the shortest wavelength IEF among what used to be known as \"the unidentified infrared features.\" The IEFs are\nobserved at 3.29 \u03bcm, 6.2 \u03bcm, 7.7 \u03bcm, 8.6 \u03bcm, 11.3 \u03bcm, and 12.7 \u03bcm. Duley & Williams (1981) were the first to suggest that\nthe 3.29 \u03bcm IEF is due to the stretching mode of an aromatic (sp2 ) C H. This identification is now widely accepted (see\nreviews by Allamandola, Tielens, & Barker 1989; Puget & L\u00e9ger 1989; Sellgren 1990, 1994; Papoular et al. 1996; Tokunaga\n1997; Geballe 1997; Salama 1999).\nThe 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission in visual reflection nebulae, such as NGC 7023, has always been observed to be accompanied\nby near-infrared (NIR) continuum emission at 2-4 \u03bcm (Sellgren, Werner, & Dinerstein 1983; Sellgren 1984; Jourdain de\nMuizon, d'Hendecourt, & Geballe 1990a,b; Sellgren, Werner, & Allamandola 1996; Joblin et al. 1996), which is not due to\nreflected starlight (Sellgren, Werner, & Dinerstein 1992). The temperature of dust grains in equilibrium with the incident\n1 Current\n\nAddress: Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge, Madingley Road, Cambridge, CB3 0HA, UK\n\n2 Visiting Astronomer at the Infrared Telescope Facility, which is operated by the University of Hawaii under a cooperative agreement with the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nstellar radiation for these visual reflection nebulae is observed to be far too low to produce any detectable NIR radiation\n(Harvey, Thronson, & Gatley 1980; Whitcomb et al. 1981; Castelaz, Sellgren, & Werner 1987; Sellgren, Luan, & Werner\n1990a; Casey 1991; Young Owl et al. 2002). Observations of NGC 7023 at 55-400 \u03bcm, in particular, are best fit by an\nequilibrium dust temperature of \u223c50 K (Whitcomb et al. 1981; Casey 1991), in clear disagreement with the characteristic\ntemperature, \u223c1000 K, of the NIR continuum emission (Sellgren et al. 1983; Sellgren 1984). This NIR continuum emission\nin visual reflection nebulae has been attributed to single stellar photons that transiently heat tiny (1 nm radius) grains to\nhigh temperature (Sellgren et al. 1983; Sellgren 1984); to vibrational or electronic fluorescence from polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbon (PAH) molecules (L\u00e9ger & Puget 1984; Allamandola, Tielens, & Barker 1985, 1989); or to photoluminescence\nof larger hydrogenated amorphous carbon (HAC) grains or carbon nanoparticles (Duley & Williams 1988; Duley 1988,\n2001).\nWhen an ultraviolet (UV) source, such as a hot star, illuminates a molecular cloud, it forms a photodissociation region\n(PDR; also referred to as a photon-dominated region) where absorption of UV photons in the Lyman-Werner bands (91.2110 nm) of molecular hydrogen (H2 ) dissociate H2 . These same photons also pump fluorescent quadrupole ro-vibrational\nH2 emission lines, and thus fluorescent H2 emission delineates the H I /H2 transition region in a PDR. Observations of the\nOrion Bar, the PDR adjoining the southeastern ionization front of the Orion Nebula (Sellgren, Tokunaga, & Nakada 1990b;\nTielens et al. 1993), and of the planetary nebula NGC 7027 (Graham et al. 1993), have shown that the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission\nis strongest between the H II region ionization front (traced by H recombination lines) and the H I /H2 dissociation front\n(traced by fluorescent H2 emission lines).\nHere we present a new high-resolution (0.\u2032\u2032 9) narrowband 3.29 \u03bcm image of the bright reflection nebula NGC 7023, and\ncompare the spatial distribution of the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission to those of other prominent NIR emission components such as\nthe NIR continuum emission near 2 \u03bcm and the 1\u20130 S(1) H2 emission line at 2.12 \u03bcm (this paper; Lemaire et al. 1996).\nNGC 7023, at a distance of 430+160\n\u221290 pc (van den Ancker et al. 1997), is one of the best-studied reflection nebulae and\nis also one of the first objects in which the NIR continuum emission accompanying the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission was detected\n(Sellgren et al. 1983). It is a part of a much larger molecular cloud, illuminated by the pre-main sequence Herbig Be star\nHD 200775, with an effective temperature Teff = 17,000 K (Strom et al. 1972; Baschek et al. 1982). The K \u2032 (broadband\n2.1 \u03bcm) image of NGC 7023 (Fig. 1; see also Sellgren et al. 1992), which contains a mixture of 2 \u03bcm continuum emission,\n2 \u03bcm scattered starlight, and H2 line emission, is dominated by extended nebulosity northwest of HD 200775, and by two\nfilamentary structures, northwest and south/southwest of the star. Various previous imaging studies show that these two\ngroups of filaments are also seen in the extended red emission (Witt & Schild 1988; Watkin, Gledhill, & Scarrott 1991),\nfluorescent H2 emission lines (Lemaire et al. 1996; Takami et al. 2000), IEFs at 6.2 \u03bcm and 11.3 \u03bcm (Cesarsky et al. 1996),\nand HCO+ emission (Fuente et al. 1996). These filaments are believed to be the interface between the molecular cloud, traced\nby CO emission (Gerin et al. 1998), and photodissociated H2 , traced by the 21 cm H I line, surrounding the star (Fuente et\nal. 1996). The filaments may represent high density (as high as n \u223c 106 cm\u22123 ) clumps embedded in somewhat lower density\ngas (n \u223c 104 cm\u22123 ) at the H I /H2 interface (Fuente et al. 1996; Lemaire et al. 1996; Martini, Sellgren, & Hora 1997; Martini,\nSellgren, & DePoy 1999; Takami et al. 2000).\n\n2. Observations and Data Reduction\nTable 1 summarizes the observations for the data presented in this paper.\nWe obtained an image of NGC 7023 at 3.29 \u03bcm with the 3 m NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) at Mauna Kea,\nHawaii, during an IRTF service observing run. The total integration time on source is 12 minutes. The central position of the\nfield is 26\u2032\u2032 W 32\u2032\u2032 N of the illuminating star HD 200775, and was selected so as to include all the northwest filaments and\nthe central star. The data were reduced in the usual way: sky subtraction and flat field correction. The sky was observed in\nan ABBA pattern, chopping between the target field and a field 5\u2032 N every 20 seconds. Sky images were used for flat fields\nas well. The final image was formed by combining 40 individual frames using a median filter to increase the signal-to-noise\nratio (S/N), and an average \u03c3-clipping algorithm was used during the combination to reject bad pixels. The final image shows\na strong ghost image (instrumental reflected light) of HD 200775 at the diagonally opposite corner (near 48\u2032\u2032 W 60\u2032\u2032 N) of its\nreal position, but the contamination is confined to a small region where the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission is faint or absent. Imaging\nat L\u2032 (broadband 3.8 \u03bcm) was also attempted during the same night and at the same site, but failed due to the saturation of\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nthe array by the high sky background at the 0.\u2032\u2032 295 pixel\u22121 scale.\nImages of 1\u20130 S(1) H2 line emission at 2.12 \u03bcm and of the \u223c2.1 \u03bcm continuum emission were derived from three\nNIR narrowband (1%) filter images at 2.09 \u03bcm, 2.12 \u03bcm, and 2.14 \u03bcm. These images were obtained on the Perkins 1.8 m\nTelescope at Lowell Observatory, Flagstaff, Arizona. After standard reduction procedures (sky subtraction and flat field\ncorrection), the image of the underlying continuum emission at \u223c2.1 \u03bcm was constructed by combining the 2.09 \u03bcm and\n2.14 \u03bcm images, wavelengths which are free of H2 emission lines (Martini et al. 1997, 1999). To obtain an image of the 1\u20130\nS(1) H2 emission line, the \u223c2.1 \u03bcm continuum image was subtracted from the 2.12 \u03bcm image after the continuum had been\nproperly scaled to have on average the same counts for ten unsaturated stars in the field, which are believed not to have H2\nemission.\nIn addition, Lemaire et al. (1996) kindly provided us with their high-resolution reduced narrowband (1%) filter images\nof NGC 7023 at 2.12 \u03bcm and 2.18 \u03bcm. Their images cover all of the field of our 3.29 \u03bcm image of NGC 7023. The images\nexhibit some instrumental artifacts, notably ghost images of HD 200775 including one near \u223c66\u2032\u2032 N of the star, and a row of\nbad pixels running \u223c34\u2032\u2032 N of HD 200775. We subtracted the 2.18 \u03bcm image from the 2.12 \u03bcm image to create an image of\nthe 1\u20130 S(1) H2 emission line.\nWe obtained images of NGC 7023 at K \u2032 on the University of Hawaii (UH) 2.2 m telescope at Mauna Kea, Hawaii\n(Sellgren et al. 1992). Dome flats were taken and used for the flat field correction. A sky image was constructed from a\nmedian-filtered combination of 8 images of offsets at 200\u2032\u2032 and 224\u2032\u2032 from HD 200775. The nebula image was constructed\nfrom a mosaic of 17 images at offsets of 0\u2032\u2032 , 30\u2032\u2032 , 71\u2032\u2032 , 100\u2032\u2032 , and 141\u2032\u2032 from HD 200775. The sky image was subtracted from\neach of the 17 nebula images before constructing the final mosaic image. Bad pixel masks were used to correct cosmic rays\nand failed pixels during the combination.\nWe also obtained archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images with the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2;\nBurrows 1995) of NGC 7023 (Stapelfeldt et al. 1997; Gordon et al. 2000) in F606W (a wide V-band). Between two available\nWFPC2 fields, the one centered near 56\u2032\u2032 W 7\u2032\u2032 N of HD 200775 covers the field containing most nebulosity around the\nnorthwest filaments on two of its wide-field camera chips (WF3 and WF4). The adjacent high-resolution (PC) chip has\nsignificant instrumental artifacts from HD 200775, but these did not cross over to the WF chips.\nFor comparison among different images, each was geometrically transformed using IRAF routines to have the same\norientation and scale as those of the final 3.29 \u03bcm image. After these geometric registrations, the images were measured to\nbe aligned with each other better than 0.\u25e6 1 in orientation, and scaled to the same pixel scale to within 0.2% in magnification\n(scale) difference.\n\n3. Images of NGC 7023\nFigure 1 displays our K \u2032 image of NGC 7023. This mosaic of images covers 6.\u2032 5\u00d76.\u20325 (0.81 pc \u00d7 0.81 pc, or 810 mpc\n\u00d7 810 mpc, where 1 mpc = 1 milliparsec = 206 AU), centered on HD 200775. Note that this covers more area than the K \u2032\nimage of Sellgren et al. (1992), who presented a single 3.\u2032 2\u00d73.\u2032 2 (400 mpc \u00d7 400 mpc) array image centered on HD 200775\n(their Fig. 2). The K \u2032 nebulosity is mainly concentrated northwest of HD 200775, except for diffuse filamentary structures\n\u223c1\u2032 (\u223c130 mpc) south/southwest of the star. Here, we focus our study on the northwestern part of NGC 7023, represented\nby a rectangular box overlaid on Figure 1, which corresponds to the field covered by our 3.29 \u03bcm image.\nFigure 2 shows the archival HST/WFPC2 F606W image (Stapelfeldt et al. 1997; Gordon et al. 2000) of the northwestern\npart of NGC 7023, for the region indicated by the box in Figure 1. Figure 2 shows three distinct filaments (labeled Filaments\nI, II, and III) and their substructures, a concentrated nebulosity closer to the illuminating star, and a diffuse \"ring\"-shaped\nstructure between them (labeled 'the ring').\nIn Figure 3, we present images of NGC 7023 for the same region as Figure 2 obtained with different narrowband filters\nat 2.09 \u03bcm, 2.12 \u03bcm, 2.14 \u03bcm, 2.18 \u03bcm, and 3.29 \u03bcm. Comparison of these images as well as K \u2032 (Fig. 1) and optical (Fig. 2)\nimages indicates that the relative contributions of different nebular components, such as scattered starlight, NIR continuum\nemission, and H2 line emission, vary with wavelength and therefore do not have identical spatial distributions.\nThe stars seen in Figures 1-3 are predominantly pre-main sequence stars (Sellgren 1983), as is HD 200775 (Herbig\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n1960). We detect five point sources in the field of Figure 2 other than HD 200775. The brightest among them is the star near\n37\u2032\u2032 W 49\u2032\u2032 N of HD 200775 (Star K in Table IIa of Sellgren 1983). Star J, as identified by Sellgren (1983), is resolved into\na visual pair separated by a projected distance of \u223c4\u2032\u2032 (\u223c8 mpc or \u223c1700 AU), one near 55\u2032\u2032 W 51\u2032\u2032 N (J2) and the other\nnear 59\u2032\u2032 W 52\u2032\u2032 N (J1) of HD 200775. The stars near 1\u2032\u2032 E 39\u2032\u2032 N and near 30\u2032\u2032 W 8\u2032\u2032 N of HD 200775 (stars G and H,\nrespectively, after the nomenclature of Sellgren 1983), were not detected by Sellgren (1983), but are clearly observed at both\noptical and NIR wavelengths (Figs. 1-3).\n\n3.1. the 2.12 \u03bcm 1\u20130 S(1) H2 line\nLemaire et al. (1996) have already published an image of NGC 7023 in the 2.12 \u03bcm 1\u20130 S(1) H2 emission line, along\nwith images at 2.12 \u03bcm (H2 line + continuum) and 2.18 \u03bcm (continuum), observed with CFHT. Takami et al. (2000) have\nalso published images of NGC 7023 in other H2 emission lines. In Figure 3, we reproduce the Lemaire et al. (1996) images,\nas well as our new 1\u20130 S(1) H2 line image of NGC 7023, for the same region as our 3.29 \u03bcm image.\nIn both H2 emission line images (Fig. 3), the only noticeable spatial structures are filaments northwest of HD 200775,\nalso seen in K \u2032 (Fig. 1; Sellgren et al. 1992). No significant H2 emission is detected in the region between the star and the\nfilaments, where diffuse nebulosity appears in 2 \u03bcm continuum images (Fig. 3; Sellgren 1986; Martini et al. 1999). These\nH2 filaments are found to extend over much greater lengths when observed with a wider field of view than Figure 3 (Fig. 1;\nSellgren et al. 1992; Lemaire et al. 1996; Takami et al. 2000). Wider field images also show another H2 filament \u223c60\u2032\u2032\nsouth/southwest of HD 200775, almost parallel to the northwest filaments shown in Figures 1-3.\nFuente et al. (1996) compare their interferometric image of HCO+ , which traces dense molecular gas, with the K \u2032 image\nof Sellgren et al. (1992). They find that the HCO+ is confined to filaments northwest of HD 200775. Fuente et al. (1996)\nshow the HCO+ filaments spatially coincide with K \u2032 filaments (Sellgren et al. 1992), while Lemaire et al. (1996) show the\nK \u2032 filaments are due to fluorescent H2 emission, which contributes H2 line emission to the broadband K \u2032 filter. Fuente et\nal. (1996) detect four kinematically separate filaments, with radial velocities between 1.9 and 4.0 km s\u22121 . The relationship\nbetween the kinematically distinct HCO+ filaments of Fuente et al. (1996) and Filaments I, II, and III, as defined in Figure 2,\nis complex. Emission from kinematically distinct filaments coincides spatially, presumably due to projection effects, and\nFuente et al. (1996) do not detect Filament III in HCO+ . Fuente et al. (1996) argue that the HCO+ filaments are due to\nincreased gas density, not increased gas column density. They also conclude that some filaments are embedded in molecular\ngas while others are embedded in neutral gas.\n\n3.2. the 3.29 \u03bcm infrared emission feature\nFigure 3 shows our 3.29 \u03bcm image of NGC 7023 along with various narrowband images of NGC 7023 near 2 \u03bcm. The\nmost prominent spatial structures in the 3.29 \u03bcm image are filaments which spatially coincide with filaments in the 1\u20130 S(1)\nH2 images. The 3.29 \u03bcm IEF is close in wavelength to the 1\u20130 O(5) H2 emission line at 3.234 \u03bcm, but this H2 line falls\noutside the 1.5-2.0% CVF bandpass at 3.29 \u03bcm and therefore does not contaminate our 3.29 \u03bcm image.\nOne can easily trace three filaments in our 3.29 \u03bcm image (Fig. 3). Filaments I, II, and III (defined in Fig. 2) appear\nto be spatially distinct, although they do not correspond to the four kinematically distinct filaments of HCO+ (Fuente et al.\n1996). The maximum 3.29 \u03bcm surface brightness (Fig. 3) is observed in Filament I. Filament II, to the east of Filament I\nand \u223c50\u2032\u2032 N of HD 200775, is much fainter and apparently wider at 3.29 \u03bcm than Filament I, in contrast to the H2 images.\nFilament III, which appears as a northern branch of Filament I, is much fainter at 3.29 \u03bcm than the other two filaments, but it\nis nevertheless clearly traceable. Much of the detailed filamentary structure in the 3.29 \u03bcm image is very similar to that seen\nin images of F606W (Fig. 2), the 1\u20130 S(1) H2 emission line at 2.12 \u03bcm (Fig. 3), and K \u2032 (Fig. 1).\nIn addition to the filaments, diffuse nebulosity at 3.29 \u03bcm is observed closer to HD 200775, forming a clear \"ring\"shaped spatial structure at projected distances from the star of 25-50\u2032\u2032 (52-100 mpc). A similar structure is also seen in the\noptical image, but it is much fainter and its shape is not identical to the ring in the 3.29 \u03bcm image. The diffuse nebulosity at\n3.29 \u03bcm is located primarily between the filaments and the central star and is only faintly detected farther from the star than\nthe filaments.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nOur efforts to correct the 3.29 \u03bcm image for \u223c3.3 \u03bcm continuum emission, by obtaining an L\u2032 image and combining it\nwith a 2 \u03bcm continuum image to interpolate a \u223c3.3 \u03bcm continuum image, were unsuccessful due to the high sky background\nat L\u2032 . Previous studies, however, that have quantified the relative strengths of the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission to the underlying\ncontinuum emission, establish that the \u223c3.3 \u03bcm continuum contributes less than 20% to narrowband 3.29 \u03bcm photometry at\nall observed positions in NGC 7023 (Sellgren et al. 1983, 1996). We therefore believe that our 3.29 \u03bcm image is dominated\nby 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission.\nFigure 4 illustrates positions, overlaid on our 3.29 \u03bcm image, where previous photometry and spectrophotometry have\nquantified the contribution of the underlying \u223c3.3 \u03bcm continuum surface brightness to the total observed surface brightness\nat 3.29 \u03bcm (hereafter f ). At position C in Figure 4, the 3.0-3.7 \u03bcm spectrophotometry of Sellgren et al. (1983) implies f =\n14%. For all other positions plotted on Figure 4, we derive f from surface photometry at K (broadband 2.2 \u03bcm), narrowband\n3.29 \u03bcm, and L\u2032 of Sellgren et al. (1996). We interpolate the continuum at 3.3 \u03bcm at each position from K and L\u2032 data\n(Sellgren et al. 1996), assuming that the continuum emission between 2.2 \u03bcm and 3.8 \u03bcm can be approximated by a powerlaw (Sellgren et al. 1983, 1985, 1996). We find that f = 18%, 13%, 12%, 10%, and 17%, at positions A, B, 1, 2, and 3,\nrespectively. Note that most positions illustrated in Figure 4 fall on diffuse 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission, with f = 12-18%, except\nfor Position 2, which falls on Filament I and has f = 10%. These published observations demonstrate that the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF\nemission accounts for & 82% of the emission in our 3.29 \u03bcm image.\n\n3.3. the 2 \u03bcm continuum\nNarrow-band images at 2.09 \u03bcm and 2.14 \u03bcm (shown as a combination in Fig. 3), and at 2.18 \u03bcm (Lemaire et al.\n1996, also shown in Fig. 3) are at wavelengths free of H2 emission lines (Martini et al. 1999), and thus represent the 2 \u03bcm\ncontinuum emission. Apart from differences in seeing and a few isolated instrumental artifacts, the two images of the 2 \u03bcm\ncontinuum emission shown in Figure 3 display a very similar morphology. While neither 2 \u03bcm continuum image in Figure 3\nhas been corrected for instrumental scattered light, they were obtained on different telescopes, with different cameras and\ndifferent orientations of the diffraction spikes of HD 200775 on the image. Hence, their similarity implies that the main\nmorphological structures in each image are intrinsic to NGC 7023 and are not artifacts of the telescope, the infrared camera,\nor the instrumental scattered light.\nThe 2 \u03bcm continuum emission is a mixture of shorter wavelength starlight transiently reprocessed by tiny particles (see\n\u00a7 4.2) and reflected NIR starlight (Sellgren et al. 1992). Sellgren et al. (1992) reported that in NGC 7023, the polarization\nrises from short to long optical wavelengths, is strongest at J, and then steadily decreases to longer NIR wavelengths, with\nthe lowest measured polarization values at their longest observed wavelength, K (13.1%, 4.6%, and 4.4% at positions A, B,\nand C, respectively, in Fig. 4). Based on this result, they conclude that scattered starlight contributes no more than \u223c20%\nto K measurements at positions near the 2 \u03bcm continuum emission peak in NGC 7023. Thus, although optical polarimetry\ndemonstrates that the optical nebulosity at the 2 \u03bcm continuum emission peak is primarily scattered starlight (Gehrels 1967;\nWatkin et al. 1991; Sellgren et al. 1992), we believe that scattered starlight makes a negligible contribution to the overall\n2 \u03bcm continuum emission.\nThe brightest nebulosity in the 2 \u03bcm continuum images is the extended peak roughly halfway between the filaments\nand HD 200775. This 2 \u03bcm continuum emission peak is centered near 17\u2032\u2032 W 19\u2032\u2032 N (\u223c53 mpc) from HD 200775, with a\ndiameter of \u223c30\u2032\u2032 (\u223c63 mpc) parallel to the filaments. The 2 \u03bcm continuum emission peak roughly corresponds to the H I\nclump detected by Fuente et al. (1996). The ring structure seen in the 3.29 \u03bcm image is only partially observed in the 2 \u03bcm\ncontinuum images. Filament I is clearly seen, but Filament II is only weakly present and Filament III may be faintly present\nonly in the 2.18 \u03bcm image (Lemaire et al. 1996). The filaments appear more diffuse in the 2 \u03bcm continuum emission than in\nthe 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission or H2 line emission images.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n4. Discussion\n4.1. the H2 fluorescence compared to the 3.29 \u03bcm infrared emission feature\nStandard PDR models (see references in Hollenbach & Tielens 1997) predict that, in PDRs, UV-pumped fluorescent H2\nemission lines are confined to a narrow transition region between H I and H2 . Spectroscopic studies (Martini et al. 1997,\n1999) and narrowband H2 imaging (Lemaire et al. 1996; Takami et al. 2000) of different H2 ro-vibrational emission lines in\nNGC 7023 show that the observed H2 emission is UV-pumped fluorescence. These authors also find evidence that the lower\nlevel populations are redistributed collisionally due to higher H2 density, especially in the H2 filaments, in agreement with\nHCO+ results (Fuente et al. 1996).\nObservations of the Orion Bar, at a distance of \u223c450 pc (O'Dell 2001), show that the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission is strongest\njust outside the ionization front (Aitken et al. 1979; Sellgren 1981; Roche, Aitken, & Smith 1989; Bregman et al. 1989;\nSellgren et al. 1990b; Tielens et al. 1993; Sloan et al. 1997). This has been interpreted to mean that the IEF carriers are\ndestroyed in H II regions, perhaps by chemical attack or two-photon transient excitation.\nThe peak 3.29 \u03bcm emission in the Orion Bar also lies significantly closer (10-15\u2032\u2032, or 22-33 mpc) to the star than does\nthe peak H2 fluorescent emission. A similar result is found for the planetary nebula NGC 7027 (Graham et al. 1993), with\nthe 3.29 \u03bcm IEF peak emission between the H II region ionization front (traced by H recombination lines) and the H I /H2\ndissociation front (traced by fluorescent H2 emission lines).\nBy contrast, Figure 5 shows that, in NGC 7023, the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission peak is essentially coincident with the H2\nfluorescent line emission peak, to within \u223c1\u2032\u2032 (\u223c2.1 mpc), although diffuse 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission is also observed closer to\nHD 200775 than the H2 fluorescent emission filaments by 15-25\u2032\u2032 (31-52 mpc).\nThe Orion Nebula and NGC 7023 are at similar distances, and both PDRs are believed to have more or less similar\ndensity structures, with high density (\u2265 106 cm\u22123 ) clumps embedded in lower density (\u2265 104 cm\u22123 ) interclump gas (Martini\net al. 1997; Young Owl et al. 2000). The two PDRs, however, differ in three respects. The Orion Bar is illuminated by the O6\nstar \u03b81 C Orionis (HD 37022), with Teff = 40,000 K (Ferland 2001), while NGC 7023 is illuminated by the pre-main sequence\nB3Ve star HD 200775, with Teff = 17,000 K. The higher effective temperature of \u03b81 C Orionis excites the brightest H II region\nin Orion, the Orion Nebula, while there is no significant H II region surrounding HD 200775. Finally, the UV flux (G0 ) is ten\ntimes greater at the Orion Bar than at the H2 filaments in NGC 7023 (Hollenbach & Tielens 1997; Martini et al. 1999).\nAlthough detailed modeling of each PDR will be required to understand the observed differences in the spatial distributions of the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission relative to the H2 dissociation front in the Orion Bar and NGC 7023, it seems likely that\nthe intensity and/or the hardness of the incident UV field plays a major role in these differences.\n\n4.2. the near-infrared continuum compared to the 3.29 \u03bcm infrared emission feature\nPrevious spectra and low-resolution photometry of reflection nebulae have shown a general association between the\n3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission and the 2 \u03bcm continuum emission (Sellgren et al. 1983, 1996) although a concrete spatial correlation\n(or lack thereof) between these two types of emission has not been previously investigated.\nAs outlined in \u00a7 1, the 2 \u03bcm continuum emission is generally thought to be the result of interactions between individual stellar photons and large gas-phase molecules or tiny solid-state grains, leading to transient NIR radiation. Proposed\nmechanisms for the 2 \u03bcm continuum emission include non-equilibrium thermal (modified graybody) emission from stochastically heated tiny grains (Sellgren et al. 1983; Sellgren 1984); vibrational fluorescence of many overtone bands and combination bands of PAH molecules blended together to form a pseudo-continuum (L\u00e9ger & Puget 1984; Allamandola et al.\n1985); continuous electronic fluorescence from PAH molecules (Allamandola et al. 1989); and continuous photoluminescent\nelectron-band transitions of solid-state particles, most notably HAC grains or carbon nanoparticles (Duley & Williams 1988;\nDuley 1988, 2001). Both the stochastically heated grains and the PAH molecules are proposed to have a size of \u223c1 nm,\nwith 50 to 100 constituent atoms. Photoluminescence from carbon nanoparticles would require a range of 220 to 260 atoms\nper nanoparticle to provide the correct bandgap energy (cf. Seahra & Duley 1999; Duley 2001) to explain the observed\n2.0-2.2 \u03bcm continuum.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nWhile the origin of the 2 \u03bcm continuum emission is uncertain, the assignment of the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF to the stretching\nmode of aromatic C H is generally agreed upon among the community. Proposed laboratory analogs or identifications\nfor the IEF carrier(s) mainly involve hydrocarbon species: carbyne (Webster 1980); an aromatic C H stretch (Duley &\nWilliams 1981); PAH molecules (L\u00e9ger & Puget 1984; Allamandola et al. 1985, 1989); quenched carbonaceous composite,\namorphous carbon, or coal with varying degrees of hydrogenation (Sakata et al. 1984, 1987; Blanco, Bussoletti, & Colangeli\n1988; Duley 1988; Papoular et al. 1989); partially or fully hydrogenated fullerenes (Webster 1992, 1993; Stoldt et al. 2001);\nnanodiamonds (Guillois, Ledoux, & Reynaud 1999; Jones & d'Hendecourt 2000; Duley & Grishko 2001); nonlinear H2\nphotoexcitation (Glownia & Sorokin 2000); and Rydberg matter (Holmlid 2000, 2001). Neutral or ionized gas-phase warm\n(\u223c1000 K) PAH molecules (see reviews by Allamandola et al. 1989; Puget & L\u00e9ger 1989; Salama 1999) are currently the\nleading candidate carrier for the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF, in the view of many researchers.\n\n4.2.1. the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF and 2.18 \u03bcm continuum morphology\nOur high-resolution images demonstrate that the distributions of the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission and the 2 \u03bcm continuum\nemission are spatially distinct in NGC 7023 (Fig. 6). The 2 \u03bcm continuum emission is strongest in the H I gas close to the\nstar, and is brightest at a projected distance of \u223c50 mpc from the star, although faint 2 \u03bcm continuum emission is also seen in\nthe H2 filaments at a projected distance of \u223c100 mpc from the star. On the other hand, the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission is strongest\nin the H2 filaments, with a projected separation from the peak of the 2 \u03bcm continuum emission of \u223c50 mpc. Somewhat\nfainter 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission, however, is also detected in the vicinity of the peak 2 \u03bcm continuum emission. This suggests\nthat the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF carriers and the 2 \u03bcm continuum emitters either are distinct and/or are excited by different physical\nmechanisms.\nMolecular hydrogen is both excited by and photodissociated by photons between 91.2 nm and 110 nm. We observe both\n2 \u03bcm continuum emission and 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission in the H I clump near the 2 \u03bcm continuum emission peak, and in the\nH2 filaments, although their relative intensities are different. This suggests that both the 2 \u03bcm continuum emitters and the\n3.29 \u03bcm IEF carriers, whether or not they are distinct, should be able to survive in H I and warm H2 .\n\n4.2.2. spatial dependence of the [2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] color\nFigure 7 quantifies the difference between the spatial distributions of the 2 \u03bcm continuum emission and 3.29 \u03bcm IEF\nemission. We used the surface photometry of Sellgren et al. (1996) to derive a photometric calibration for the 3.29 \u03bcm image\n(Fig. 3), and the K surface photometry of Sellgren et al. (1996) to derive a photometric calibration for the K \u2032 image (Fig. 1).\nWe used this calibration technique in preference to the standard stars we observed for these two images, because we were\ninterested in the faint extended emission on images with large sky background subtraction and comparison with the results\nof Sellgren et al. (1996). The 2.18 \u03bcm image (Lemaire et al. 1996) shown in Figure 3 was then calibrated by scaling it to\nhave the same stellar magnitudes on average for stars in common between the K \u2032 and 2.18 \u03bcm images. Note that the original\nfield of view of both images are actually larger than Figure 3 (Fig. 1 of this paper; Figs. 1-3 of Lemaire et al. 1996) and the\nscaling is based upon six stars common in that field. None of the stars used for scaling were saturated.\nWe smoothed both the 2.18 \u03bcm and 3.29 \u03bcm images with a 3 pixel \u00d7 3 pixel boxcar, to increase our S/N on faint\nextended emission. All images presented in this paper have been resampled to a common scale of 0.\u2032\u2032 295 pixel\u22121 , which\noversamples the 0.\u2032\u2032 9 seeing of our 3.29 \u03bcm image and the 0.\u2032\u2032 8 seeing of the 2.18 \u03bcm image (Lemaire et al. 1996). Thus\nthis smoothing should not significantly degrade the spatial resolution of these two images. The noise in the sky-subtracted,\ncalibrated, smoothed 3.29 \u03bcm image was measured by deriving the standard deviation in regions with little or no 3.29 \u03bcm\nemission. All pixels with fluxes less than three times this noise were set to zero. The same clipping process was applied to\nthe sky-subtracted, calibrated, smoothed 2.18 \u03bcm image.\nFinally, the calibrated 2.18 \u03bcm and 3.29 \u03bcm images were divided, then converted to mag arcsec\u22122 . Figure 7 illustrates\nthe distribution of the resulting color, as contours of [2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm], overlaid on the 2.18 \u03bcm grayscale image.\nFigure 7 shows the surprising result that, despite the complicated morphology of NGC 7023, the [2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm]\ncolor varies smoothly across NGC 7023, with a steady increase in this color with projected distance from HD 200775, ranging\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nfrom the 2 \u03bcm continuum emission peak to Filament I. Neither the 2 \u03bcm continuum emission peak, nor the \"ring\"-shaped\nregion of lower 3.29 \u03bcm surface brightness between the 2 \u03bcm continuum emission peak and the H2 filaments (Fig. 3), show up\nas spatial structures in Figure 7. The [2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] color illustrated in Figure 7 reaches its largest values in Filament\nI (Fig. 2). Observations of Filament III suggest that the [2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] color begins to decrease at further projected\ndistances from the star, beyond Filament I.\nThe radial dependence of the [2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] color is quantified in Figure 8. In this, we plot pixel values of\n[2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] versus projected radius r from HD 200775. To reduce the scatter, we increased the threshold for\ndetection to 5-\u03c3 in each [2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] pixel, and masked all stars and all instrumental artifacts in the images. We\nalso plot, for comparison, single detector measurements of K\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] from Sellgren et al. (1996). Note that K\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm]\nis generally lower than [2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm], which is in part due to contamination by H2 emission lines in the K filter.\nHowever, the radial pattern followed by individual pixels of [2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] in Figure 8 is generally followed also by\nthe lower spatial resolution data for K\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm], including both the rise from the 2 \u03bcm continuum emission peak to Filament\nI, and the lower values at r > 50\u2032\u2032 . The positions at which the K\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] data were taken are illustrated in Figure 4.\nWe calculated a least-square regression line to the [2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] pixel values versus log10 (r), for r < 50\u2032\u2032 [or\nlog10 (r/arcsec) < 1.7]. This line, with a slope of 5.33 \u00b1 0.04, is shown in Figure 8. This slope corresponds to a power law\nradial dependence for the surface brightness ratio, I2.18 /I3.29 \u221d r\u2212\u03b1 , with the power index \u03b1 being 2.13 \u00b1 0.02. Here I2.18\nand I3.29 are the 2.18 \u03bcm and 3.29 \u03bcm surface brightnesses. This is a strong suggestion that, in the region between the 2 \u03bcm\ncontinuum emission peak and the brightest 3.29 \u03bcm IEF filament, the difference between these two spatial distributions is\nrelated to stellar illumination.\nNeither the 2.18 \u03bcm image nor the 3.29 \u03bcm image is corrected for instrumental scattered light from HD 200775. Because\nthe spectrum of HD 200775 does not show the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF (Sellgren 1984), the effects of instrumental scattered light are\nexpected to be stronger at 2.18 \u03bcm than 3.29 \u03bcm. We investigated whether the radial dependence of [2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm]\ncould be due in part to instrumental scattered light by examining the K \u2032 image (Fig. 1). On the same night that the K \u2032\nimage of NGC 7023 was obtained, a K \u2032 image of HR 8143 was also obtained with the same integration time. HR 8143\n(K = 3.80, Elias et al. 1982) is brighter than HD 200775 (K = 4.62, Sellgren 1983), and is not surrounded by any nebulosity,\nso should provide a robust measure of the effect of instrumental scattered light. We corrected the K \u2032 image of Figure 1 for\ninstrumental scattered light, and then examined the radial dependence of K \u2032 \u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] for r < 50\u2032\u2032 , where H2 makes little\nor no contribution to the K \u2032 surface brightness. We found no difference in slope for K \u2032 \u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] versus log10 (r) whether\nor not K \u2032 was corrected for instrumental scattered light. We therefore conclude that instrumental scattered light only has\nminimal effects on our observations of [2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] shown in Figures 7 and 8.\nThe smooth increase of [2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] with projected distance from HD 200775 (Figs. 7 & 8) is very intriguing, given the very different spatial distributions of 2.18 \u03bcm and 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission shown in Figure 6. This\nimplies that the extended 2 \u03bcm continuum emission peak is a region of higher column density, compared to the low surface brightness region that lies between the 2 \u03bcm continuum emission peak and the H2 filaments. The smooth increase in\n[2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm], independent of variations in column density, therefore suggests that the main factor that contributes to\nvariations in [2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] is the decrease in stellar flux with increasing projected distance from the star.\nThe radial increase in [2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] with increasing distance from HD 200775 could be due to several factors.\nWe present three possibilities here, but other explanations, such as hydrogenation or other chemical alteration of the 3.29 \u03bcm\nIEF carriers and/or 2.18 \u03bcm continuum emitters within the H I and H2 regions of NGC 7023, remain to be explored.\nIt has been proposed that the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF arises from the smallest PAHs in a PAH size distribution (Allamandola et al.\n1989; Schutte, Tielens, & Allamandola 1993). It has also been suggested that the smallest PAHs are most easily destroyed in\na strong UV radiation field (D\u00e9sert, Boulanger, & Puget 1990; Allain, Leach, & Sedlmayer 1996). If the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF arises\nin small PAHs which are preferentially destroyed near HD 200775, and if the 2.18 \u03bcm continuum arises either from larger\nPAHs, from more robust tiny grains, or from larger carbon nanoparticles, none of which are destroyed near HD 200775, then\nthis could explain our observed radial increase in [2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] for NGC 7023.\nIf PAHs are the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF carrier, then PAH ionization could play a major role in the radial dependence of the\n[2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] color in NGC 7023. The electron density, ne , which depends on the total gas density, is higher at the\n3.29 \u03bcm filaments than at the 2 \u03bcm peak (Fuente et al. 1996; Lemaire et al. 1996; Martini et al. 1997, 1999; Gerin et al. 1998;\nTakami et al. 2000). More importantly, the UV field, G0 , is also lower at the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF filaments than at the 2 \u03bcm peak,\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nwith G0 \u223c r\u22122 . Since the PAH ionization fraction is lower for lower G0 /ne (Bakes & Tielens 1994), this could result in a\nlower PAH ionization fraction in the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF filaments than at the 2 \u03bcm peak. Theoretical calculations and laboratory\nexperiments show that the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF is significantly weaker in ionized PAHs than neutral PAHs (de Frees et al. 1993;\nSzczepanski & Vala 1993). If the 2 \u03bcm continuum emitters do not change ionization state or their emission is not affected\nby ionization state, then PAH ionization effects might be sufficient to explain the radial dependence of [2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm]\nshown in Figures 7 and 8.\nA third alternative has to do with extinction and the excitation of the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF and the 2 \u03bcm continuum emission.\nThe stellar radiation from HD 200775 is systematically reddened with distance from the star, resulting in a softer UV field at\nlarger values of r. Sellgren (1984) proposed that the 2 \u03bcm continuum is due to stochastically heated tiny grains, which require\nenergetic UV photons to excite them. The 3.3 \u03bcm IEF has been proposed to be due to quenched carbonaceous composite,\namorphous carbon, or coal (Sakata et al. 1984, 1987; Blanco et al. 1988; Duley 1988; Papoular et al. 1989), all substances\nwhich absorb well at visible as well as UV wavelengths. If the 3.3 \u03bcm IEF could be excited by less energetic photons than\nthe photons required for the 2 \u03bcm continuum emission, then the internal nebular extinction within NGC 7023 could cause the\n[2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] color to increase with distance from the star. This possibility seems least likely, because Sellgren et al.\n(1996) find no evidence that the K\u2212[3.3 \u03bcm] color depends on Teff of the illuminating star, over Teff = 11,000-22,000 K.\n\n4.2.3. observed values of [2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] in NGC 7023\nAnother exciting result illustrated in Figures 7 and 8 is that the peak value of [2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] is \u223c5.5 mag in the\nH2 filaments. Sellgren et al. (1996) measured or placed upper limits on K\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] in 14 different reflection nebulae. In\nseveral reflection nebulae, including NGC 7023, K\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] was measured at multiple spatial locations. The highest value\nof K\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] measured by Sellgren et al. (1996) in any reflection nebula, over a wide range of stellar effective temperature\nand stellar flux, is K\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm]= 4.5 mag. Thus the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF filaments in NGC 7023 are roughly 2.5 times brighter,\ncompared to the 2 \u03bcm continuum emission, than any other measured value in a reflection nebula.\nCare must be taken in comparing our measured values of [2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] (Figs. 7 & 8) and published values\nof K\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm]. The broadband K measurements of Sellgren et al. (1996) include both 2 \u03bcm continuum emission and\nH2 line emission, while the 2.18 \u03bcm images (Lemaire et al. 1996) were not corrected for instrumental scattered light. We\nbelieve this has a minimal effect on our results, since the H2 emission is so tightly confined to the filaments. Values of\n[2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] greater than 4.8 mag are seen over an extended region outside the H2 filaments. Another issue is the\n\u223c3.3 \u03bcm continuum emission that underlies the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission. Without an L\u2032 image of NGC 7023, we do not know\nhow much of the increase in [2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] in Figures 7 and 8 is due to a redder underlying continuum emission. In\nparticular, we cannot derive a 3.29 \u03bcm IEF feature-to-continuum ratio, which is the usual metric of the strength of the 3.29 \u03bcm\nIEF emission. Sellgren et al. (1996), however, presented measurements of the narrowband 3.29 \u03bcm surface brightness, in\ntheir Table 4 and Figure 5, which are not corrected for the underlying \u223c3.3 \u03bcm continuum emission. These are the results\nwith which we compare the data shown in Figure 8.\nThe positions measured in the reflection nebula sample of Sellgren et al. (1996) were chosen by first searching for\nthe brightest regions of K emission. The K filter was chosen for initial mapping of each reflection nebula because the\nhigh thermal background at 3.29 \u03bcm makes K-band data vastly easier to obtain than 3.29 \u03bcm narrowband data. Thus, the\npositions where Sellgren et al. (1996) measured K\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] are biased toward being near the 2 \u03bcm continuum emission\npeak. Figure 7 shows that the 2 \u03bcm continuum emission peak in NGC 7023 has the smallest value of [2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm]\nthat we were able to measure. It is intriguing that the highest 3.29 \u03bcm IEF feature-to-continuum ratio measured by Sellgren\net al. (1996) is \u223c9, corresponding to K\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] = 4.5 mag. Since we measure [2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] = 5.5 mag in the\nH2 filaments of NGC 7023, we can speculate that the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF feature-to-continuum ratio could be as high as \u223c23 if\nthe underlying continuum color is unchanged. This can only be confirmed by future observations that provide an estimate\nof the \u223c3.3 \u03bcm continuum emission underlying the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission. We note, however, that Figure 6 of Sellgren et\nal. (1996) shows no correlation between K \u2212 L\u2032 and 3.29 \u03bcm IEF feature-to-continuum ratio. Furthermore, support for a\nhigh feature-to-continuum ratio in the 3.29 \u03bcm filaments in NGC 7023 is provided by the spectra of Joblin et al. (1996), who\nfind 3.29 \u03bcm feature-to-continuum ratios of up to 20, 34, and 37 in the reflection nebula NGC 2023, the Orion Bar, and the\nreflection nebula surrounding NGC 1333/SVS-3 (NGC 1333 3), respectively.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nFigures 6, 7, and 8 may hold out the promise of making significant progress in understanding the emission mechanisms,\nand/or the relationship between the 2 \u03bcm continuum emitters and the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF carriers. The difference in the spatial\ndistributions of 2 \u03bcm continuum emission and 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission in NGC 7023, with the 2 \u03bcm continuum emission\nstrongest in neutral gas and the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission strongest in dense molecular filaments, is one essential clue. Even more\nintriguing, the smooth increase of the [2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] color with increasing projected distance from the illuminating\nstar of NGC 7023 points towards the stellar flux playing a crucial role in determining the relative strengths of the 2 \u03bcm\ncontinuum emission and the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission.\n\n5.\n\nSummary\n\nWe compare the spatial distributions of the 3.29 \u03bcm infrared emission feature (IEF), the 2.12 \u03bcm 1\u20130 S(1) H2 emission\nline, and the 2 \u03bcm continuum emission, in the bright visual reflection nebula NGC 7023. The H2 emission, due to UV-pumped\nfluorescence, arises in narrow, dense filaments at the dissociation front at the edge of the molecular cloud. The 3.29 \u03bcm IEF\nemission is also very strong in the same filaments, but the 2 \u03bcm continuum emission is quite weak there. On the other hand,\nthe 2 \u03bcm continuum emission is very bright in the region between the H2 filaments and the illuminating star of NGC 7023,\nHD 200775. The 2 \u03bcm continuum emission is brightest \u223c25\u2032\u2032 (\u223c52 mpc) from HD 200775, roughly midway between the star\nand the filaments. There is also a distinct \"ring\"-shaped spatial structure that emits weakly at 3.29 \u03bcm and is located between\nthe 2 \u03bcm continuum emission peak and the filaments.\nOur observation that both the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission and the H2 fluorescent emission are brightest in narrow filaments,\nand are spatially coincident to within \u223c2 mpc, is in stark contrast to observations of the Orion Bar ionization front and of\nthe planetary nebulae NGC 7027. Both the Orion Bar and NGC 7027 show a clear spatial separation between the 3.29 \u03bcm\nIEF emission and the H2 emission. At the Orion Bar, the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission peak is 22-33 mpc closer to the exciting star\nof the Orion Nebula than is the fluorescent H2 peak, a separation at least a factor of ten larger than observed in NGC 7023.\nBecause NGC 7023 and the Orion Bar have similar gas density structures, the difference in the projected distance between the\n3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission peak and H2 peak between NGC 7023 and the Orion Bar is likely to be either related to the intensity\nof the incident UV field, which is ten times higher in the Orion Bar than in NGC 7023, and/or related to the hardness of the\nincident UV field, as indicated by the effective temperature of each exciting star (17,000 K for NGC 7023 and 40,000 K for\nthe Orion Nebula).\nWe observe very dissimilar spatial distributions of the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission and the 2 \u03bcm continuum emission, and in\nparticular, a clear separation between the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission peak and the 2 \u03bcm continuum emission peak. This suggests\nthree possible interpretations, any or all of which could be correct: the excitation mechanisms for the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission\nand the 2 \u03bcm continuum emission are different; the emission processes for the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission and the 2 \u03bcm continuum\nemission are distinct; or the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF carriers and the 2 \u03bcm continuum emitters are not identical. This is in contrast to\nprevious assumptions that the 2 \u03bcm continuum emission in visual reflection nebula was associated with the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF\nemission.\nThe spatial distribution of the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission in NGC 7023 indicates that the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF carriers in NGC 7023\nprefer warm molecular gas, in contrast to the separation of H2 fluorescent emission and 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission in the Orion\nBar or NGC 7027. The 3.29 \u03bcm IEF carriers in NGC 7023, however, can survive in both neutral atomic and warm molecular\ngas. The 2 \u03bcm continuum image indicates that the 2 \u03bcm continuum emitters in NGC 7023 are predominantly associated with\nH I gas but can survive in both neutral atomic and warm molecular gas.\nThe value of [2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm], however, increases smoothly with increasing projected distance from the star, with\nvalues of 3.4-3.6 mag at the 2 \u03bcm continuum emission peak, and reaching values of 5.5 mag in the H2 filaments where the\n3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission is brightest. The smoothness of the radial variation in [2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm], compared to the very\nstructured morphology of the 2 \u03bcm continuum and 3.29 \u03bcm IEF images, suggests that the column densities of the 2 \u03bcm\ncontinuum emitters and the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF carriers are not the origin of the differences between the spatial distributions of\nthese two ISM components. The smooth increase in [2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] with increasing projected distance r from the\nstar, corresponding to a surface brightness ratio I2.18 /I3.29 \u223c r\u22122.1 , instead suggests that the intensity of the incident stellar\nradiation field is directly or indirectly related to the differences between the spatial distributions of 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission and\n2 \u03bcm continuum emission.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nWe do not have a specific model to explain our observation that I2.18 /I3.29 \u223c r\u22122.1 in NGC 7023. One idea involves the\ndestruction of the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF carriers, but not the 2 \u03bcm continuum emitters, in the intense radiation field near HD 200775.\nAnother possibility is a changing ionization fraction with distance from HD 200775 for PAHs, which have been proposed as\na 3.29 \u03bcm IEF carrier, together with the assumption that the 2 \u03bcm continuum emission is insensitive to the ionization state\nof its emitters or that its emitters do not change ionization state within NGC 7023. A third concept invokes internal nebular\nextinction, if the 2 \u03bcm continuum emitters are excited by more energetic photons than the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF carriers.\nThe previously measured range of K\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] in different spatial positions in 14 reflection nebulae is 3.0-4.5 mag\n(Sellgren et al. 1996). Thus, the [2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] value at the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission peak is 1 mag higher than previously\nobserved in any reflection nebula. If K \u2212 L\u2032 is independent of K\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm], as observed by Sellgren et al. (1996), then the\n3.29 \u03bcm IEF feature-to-continuum ratio could be as high as \u223c23 in the H2 filaments in NGC 7023, but this speculation\nremains to be confirmed by future observations.\nWe thank the IRTF TAC for granting time for our service observing proposal and David Griep and Charles Kaminski\nfor obtaining the 3.29 \u03bcm images of NGC 7023.

The offsets are in arcseconds from the illuminating star, HD 200775, which lies in the region not covered\nby WFPC2 chips. Three filaments and a ring structure discussed in the text (\u00a7 3), are labeled. Also indicated are five stars\nidentified in the field (\u00a7 3). On the side of the PC chip adjacent to HD 200775, instrumental artifacts are significantly observed\nbut they are not crossed over to the WF chips. The PSF is \u223c0.\u2032\u2032 2 (FWHM) for the PC chip.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Narrow-band (\u2206\u03bb/\u03bb = 1-2%) images at 2.12 \u03bcm, a combination of 2.09 \u03bcm and 2.14 \u03bcm, 2.18 \u03bcm, and 3.29 \u03bcm\nof the northwest region of NGC 7023. The region shown is the same as Fig. 2. Left column: 2.12 \u03bcm (top); 2.18 \u03bcm\n(middle); and 1\u20130 S(1) H2 line emission (bottom), from the difference between 2.12 \u03bcm and 2.18 \u03bcm images (Lemaire et\nal. 1996). Seeing is 0.\u2032\u2032 8. Right column: 3.29 \u03bcm (top), \u223c2.1 \u03bcm continuum (middle), from the combination of 2.09 \u03bcm and\n2.14 \u03bcm images; and 1\u20130 S(1) H2 line emission (bottom), from the difference between our 2.12 \u03bcm image (not shown) and\nour \u223c2.1 \u03bcm continuum image (this paper). Seeing in our 3.29 \u03bcm image is 0.\u2032\u2032 9 (FWHM), and in our 2.09 \u03bcm, 2.12 \u03bcm,\nand 2.14 \u03bcm images is 2.\u2032\u2032 8 (FWHM). The spatial structures at the upper left corner of the 2.12 \u03bcm and 2.18 \u03bcm images\n(Lemaire et al. 1996) and at the upper right corner of the 3.29 \u03bcm image are ghost images (the instrumental reflected light\nof HD 200775). The horizontal line, \u223c34\u2032\u2032 N of HD 200775, in the data from Lemaire et al. (1996), is due to a row of bad\npixels in their array detector. Both images of the 1\u20130 S(1) H2 emission line show artifacts due to imperfect subtraction of the\ncontinuum for field stars.\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- Contours of K \u2032 surface brightness overlaid on our 3.29 \u03bcm grayscale image. Circles drawn with solid lines: the\n10.\u2032\u2032 5 diameter apertures for both the K polarimetry of Sellgren et al. (1992) and the K, 3.29 \u03bcm, and L\u2032 surface photometry of\nSellgren et al. (1983, 1996). The K polarization (Sellgren et al. 1992) is 13.1% (A), 4.6% (B), and 4.4% (C). Circles drawn\nwith dotted lines: 6.\u2032\u2032 2 diameter aperture surface photometry at K, 3.29 \u03bcm, and L\u2032 of Sellgren et al. (1996). The contribution\nof \u223c3.3 \u03bcm continuum surface brightness to the observed 3.29 \u03bcm surface brightness at these positions (Sellgren et al. 1996)\nis 12% (1), 10% (2), 17% (3), 18% (A), 13% (B), and 14% (C). The horizontal and vertical lines in K \u2032 extending from the\ncentral star to \u223c30\u2032\u2032 W and to \u223c30\u2032\u2032 N are diffraction spikes from HD 200775, although the star \u223c40\u2032\u2032 N of HD 200775 is\nreal. The 3.29 \u03bcm emission structure at 48\u2032\u2032 W 60\u2032\u2032 N is the instrumentally reflected image of HD 200775.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n\nFig. 5.- Contours of 1\u20130 S(1) H2 emission (Lemaire et al. 1996), created from the difference of 1% spectral resolution images at 2.12 \u03bcm (line + continuum) and 2.18 \u03bcm (continuum), overlaid on the new 3.29 \u03bcm grayscale image.\nBase contour (drawn 3-\u03c3 above the sky noise) of the difference between 2.12 \u03bcm and 2.18 \u03bcm narrowband images is\nI\u03bd = 6 MJy sr\u22121 , and the intervals are 3 MJy sr\u22121 . For 1% spectral resolution filters, this corresponds to a base contour\nof I = 8.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 and intervals of I = 4.2 \u00d7 10\u22125 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 in H2 line emission intensity. The H2\nfilaments are coincident with the strongest 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission, but faint 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission is also seen between the\nfilaments and the star.\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\n\nFig. 6.- Contours of 2.18 \u03bcm continuum emission (Lemaire et al. 1996) overlaid on the new 3.29 \u03bcm grayscale image.\nThe 2.18 \u03bcm image was obtained with 1% spectral resolution, while the 3.29 \u03bcm image was obtained with 1.5-2.0% spectral\nresolution. Thus the 2.18 \u03bcm image samples the 2 \u03bcm continuum between H2 lines, while the 3.29 \u03bcm image measures the\npeak emission of the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF. Base contour (drawn 4-\u03c3 above the sky noise) is drawn at I2.18 = 6 MJy sr\u22121 , and the\nintervals are 3 MJy sr\u22121 . The 2.18 \u03bcm continuum emission is brightest between the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF filaments and the star, and\nis weak in the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF filaments. Faint 3.29 \u03bcm IEF emission, however, is also seen between the 3.29 \u03bcm IEF filaments\nand the star.\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\n\nFig. 7.- Contours of [2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] narrowband (1-2%) colors, smoothed with a 3 pixel \u00d7 3 pixel (0.\u2032\u2032 89\u00d70.\u2032\u203289)\nboxcar, superposed on the grayscale 2.18 \u03bcm continuum image of Lemaire et al. (1996). Contour values are 3.0 mag,\n3.6 mag, 4.2 mag, 4.8 mag, and 5.4 mag, and are only shown where the emission was 3-\u03c3 above the noise in both the\n2.18 \u03bcm and 3.29 \u03bcm images.\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\n\nFig. 8.- Individual pixel values of [2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] narrowband (1-2%) colors (small dots), smoothed with a 3 pixel\n\u00d7 3 pixel (0.\u2032\u2032 89\u00d70.\u2032\u2032 89) boxcar, plotted against the log of the projected radius r in arcsec from HD 200775. Values are only\nshown where the S/N in both [2.18 \u03bcm] and [3.29 \u03bcm] was \u2265 5. Values of K\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] colors (filled circles with error\nbars) are also plotted, with the horizontal error bars representing the photometric aperture diameter (Sellgren et al. 1996). A\nleast-squares fit to [2.18 \u03bcm]\u2212[3.29 \u03bcm] vs. log10 (r) for log10 (r/arcsec) < 1.7 (solid line) is also shown, and has a slope of\n5.3. This corresponds to a surface brightness ratio of I2.18 /I3.29 \u223c r\u22122.1 .\n\n\f"}
