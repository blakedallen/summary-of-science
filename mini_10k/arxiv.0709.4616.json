Introduction\nThe charm sector provides a unique testing ground for understanding\nthe strong interaction. The large data samples of open charm and charmonium decays now available facilitate detailed theory-experiment comparisons. Moreover, many lessons learned from charm can be transferred to\nthe bottom sector. Perturbative methods are applicable when charm decay\nis concerned; yet it is also possible to explore relativistic effects due to the\nlight (in comparison with bottom) charm-quark mass.\nThe immediate goals of the analyses presented here 1 are to study charm\nfor its own sake, to treat it as a calibration ground for methods developed for\nheavier systems, and to use it as a production site for light-quark systems.\n2. Open Charm\n2.1. Leptonic and semileptonic decays\nLeptonic and semileptonic decays allow the study of the effect that QCD\nhas in weak decays, where the interaction between the quarks modifies the\ndecay rates induced by the weak process.\nFor leptonic decays such as D \u2192 l\u03bd, the goal is a precision branching\n2 |V |2 , can\nfraction measurement which, via the relation \u0393(D + \u2192 l+ \u03bd) \u221d fD\ncd\n\u2217\n1\n\nPresented at The XXVII Physics In Collision, June 26-29, 2007, Annecy, France\nIn this document, reproduction of graphics shown in the talk will be limited to figures\nthat are not readily available in publications.\n\n(1)\n\n\f2\n\npic07 \u0307proceedings \u0307mahlke\n\nprinted on November 10, 2018\n\nbe turned into a measurement of the decay constant fD , with the external\ninput of the CKM matrix element Vcd . Similar relations hold for leptonic\nDs , B, and Bs decays. Measurements of fD and fDs can be compared\nto calculations, thereby validating computation techniques that can then\nconfidently be applied in the B system, where entities quantifying the effects\nof strong interaction must be provided as an external input in order to\narrive at e.g. Vtd . The experimental precision currently achieved is about\n5% on fD (CLEO [1]) and 8% on fDs (CLEO [2] and BaBar [3]). The\nCLEO measurements are absolute determinations, while the BaBar result\nis obtained relative to the decay Ds \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0, which entails a dependency\non the normalization branching fraction. A recent lattice QCD (LQCD)\ncalculation [4] is in broad agreement with the measured results given the\nexperimental uncertainties, but quotes a superior precision of 1 \u2212 2%.\nFor semileptonic decays, for example D \u2192 \u03c0l\u03bd, a different kinematic\nvariable enters, namely the momentum transfer q 2 to the outgoing hadron.\nThe differential rate for decay to a pseudoscalar, d\u0393/dq 2 (D \u2192 P l\u03bd), is\nproportional to |Vcq |2 \u00d7 |f+ (q 2 )|2 \u00d7 p3P . The modification of the weak decay\nby the strong force present between the ingoing quark, outgoing quark, and\nspectator quark is described by the pseudoscalar form factor f+ (q 2 ). The\nvalue of pP is determined by kinematics, and also the form factor shape does\nnot require additional external information. For normalization, experiment\ncan access the product Vcq \u00d7 f+ (0), and therefore input of either Vcq or the\nform factor normalization f+ (0) is required to determine the other one.\nExperimental progress has seen drastic improvements in accuracy for\nall branching fractions, and some new ones observed for the first time,\nsuch as D 0 \u2192 (K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )e+ \u03bd [5] at 4\u03c3 statistical significance, B(D 0 \u2192\n\u22124\n(K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )e+ \u03bd) = (2.8+1.4\n\u22121.1 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 10 .

As to\nD \u2192 P form factor shapes, data currently can accommodate the modified pole model [9] or the series parametrization [10]. World data agree on\nthe form factor shape within the current error levels; the shape predicted\nfrom an unquenched LQCD calculation in Ref. [6] agrees with the data for\nD \u2192 Kl\u03bd (Fig. 1 left), but seems to trend towards values larger than the\ndata at upper q 2 in D \u2192 \u03c0l\u03bd (Fig. 1 right).\n2.2. Hadronic decays\nThe hadronic decay rate can give insight into a more intricate interplay\nbetween manifestations of the strong interaction. An added complication\nis that, with several hadrons produced, final state interactions take place\nwhich are hard to quantify.\nBranching fraction measurements have an especially far-reaching impact for channels that are used as normalization modes. One such example is D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + , for which\nboth CLEO [7] and BaBar [8] have\nPDG04\nnew measurements using very different techniques. The relative precisions achieved by both are about\n2%, dominated by systematic uncertainties. At this level of sensitivity,\nestimating the uncertainty on final\nstate radiation corrections is an important task as these contributions\nare not negligible. CLEO also measured absolute branching fractions\nfor other Cabibbo-favored D 0 and\nD + decays [7]: most of these results\n0.020\n0.030\n0.040\n0.050\nFig. 2:\nMeasurements of the branching are the most precise to date.\n0\n\u2212 +\nfraction B(D \u2192 K \u03c0 ).\n\nA comparison of the rates for the Cabibbo-favored decay D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 +\nwith the Cabibbo-suppressed ones D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + and D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 K + found\nthat, after adjusting for phase space, the measured rates [11] do not behave\nas expected, namely proportionally to the squares of the CKM matrix element ratios involved: (Vcd /Vcs )2 \u2248 0.05 for \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + : K \u2212 \u03c0 + , K \u2212 K + : K \u2212 \u03c0 + ,\nand unity for \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + : K \u2212 K + . Instead, one finds, for \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + : K \u2212 \u03c0 + ,\nK \u2212 K + : K \u2212 \u03c0 + , and K \u2212 K + : \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + the values [13] 0.034 \u00b1 0.001, 0.111 \u00b1\n0.002, 3.53 \u00b1 0.12. Both Belle [12] and BaBar [13] extended this study to\nsee if the same imbalance would hold for three-body decays, in which a \u03c0 0\n\n\f4\n\npic07 \u0307proceedings \u0307mahlke\n\nprinted on November 10, 2018\n\nwas added to each of the above channels. Those measurement support the\nexpectation at the level of 30%.\nCLEO [14] performed a systematic search for ten Ds \u2192 P1 P2 decays,\nwhere modes with P1 = K + or \u03c0 + and P2 = \u03b7, \u03b7, \u03c0 0 , KS or KL are\nstudied. This comprises all decays to a pair of mesons from the lowestlying pseudoscalar meson nonet. The analysis measures Cabibbo-suppressed\nbranching fractions relative to those of the corresponding Cabibbo-favored\nmode. The suppression ratio is, again, expected to be of order |Vcd /Vcs |2 ,\nwhich is confirmed by the data. Signals are seen in all modes except for the\nisospin-forbidden decay Ds \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 .\nOther questions to be addressed with hadronic multi-body decays are the\nproduction of intermediate resonances and their properties, or suppression\npatterns of certain channels. The description of the multi-body final state is\ndependent on the formalism used and introduces model dependencies that\ncannot be removed. Points of debate are the existence of a sound theoretical\nbasis (as opposed to just achieving a satisfactory description of the data),\nquality control (what constitutes a satisfactory description), knowledge of\ninferred or expected intermediate states (in particular, consistency with\nscattering experiments), and the importance and treatment of final state\ninteractions. Similar questions arise in the B system.\nFOCUS [15] analyzed D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + events, first determining the\nbranching fraction relative to D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + , which is the most precise to date and in agreement with data from CLEO-c, but then moving\nto an amplitude analysis. Two important motivations, aside from the fact\nthat for this decay it had not been done before, are to examine the importance of final state interactions (which are is expected to be greater in\nfour-body than in three-body decays); and developing an understanding of\nintermediate resonances such as the a1 (1260), expected to be relevant in\nB 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + . The FOCUS model incorporates ten baseline components: D 0 \u2192 a1 (1260)+ \u03c0 \u2212 with a1 (1260)+ \u2192 \u03c10 \u03c0 + (S and D wave) and\na1 (1260)+ \u2192 \u03c3\u03c0 \u2212 , D 0 \u2192 \u03c10 \u03c10 in three helicity states, and D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 + R\nwith R = \u03c3, \u03c10 , f0 (980), f2 (1270). The fit returns the a1 (1260) a dominant contributor with a fit fraction of about 60%, as is the case also in\nK \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + and K 0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + . The group \u03c10 \u03c10 yields a fit fraction of 25%\nthe rest, \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 + R, contributes about 11%. While these components get\nthe gross features of kinematic distributions right, the confidence level is\nlow and cannot be improved by inclusion of further signal amplitudes. This\ncan either imply that the model is too simplistic, and/or that final state\ninteractions cannot be ignored.\nThe information on the mass and the width of the a1 (1260) extracted\nfrom the fit result is more precise than the current PDG average and agrees\nwith theoretical predictions (of similar precision).\n\n\fpic07 \u0307proceedings \u0307mahlke\n\nprinted on November 10, 2018\n\n5\n\n2.3. Open-charm spectroscopy\nThe production of pairs of open-charm mesons can be observed in e+ e\u2212\nscattering, and particularly interesting features are observed near threshold. The production cross-sections as a function of center-of-mass energy\nshow structure that can either directly be interpreted as bound states in\nthe charmonium system, or as the effect of interference from several resonance at nearby energies. Since the bound states decay to different pairs of\nmesons depending on their quantum numbers and mass, in order to obtain a\ncomplete picture it is important to measure the production cross-section for\ndifferent pairs of mesons, not just the inclusive or just, for example, D + D \u2212 .\nPredictions for the production of D pairs can be found for example in [16].\nProduction cross-section data on exist from CLEO (e+ e\u2212 \u2192 D D\u0304, D \u2217 D\u0304,\n\u2217\nD D\u0304 \u2217 , Ds+ Ds\u2212 , Ds\u2217+ Ds\u2212 , Ds\u2217+ Ds\u2217\u2212 at a center-of-mass energy ECM \u223c 4 GeV)\nas well as Belle and BaBar (e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 + D D\u0304, D \u2217+ D \u2212 , D \u2217+ D \u2217\u2212 at ECM \u223c\n10 GeV; [17]); both agree on the rough features. A comparison between the\nsum of the CLEO channels with an inclusive measurement (with the uds\ncontinuum subtracted) reveals multi-body contributions of the type D \u2217 D\u03c0.\nThe characteristic enhancements in the inclusive cross-section between\n3.7 and 4.5 GeV are commonly associated with the \u03c8(3770), \u03c8(4040),\n\u03c8(4160), and \u03c8(4415) states of charmonium. Their mass and widths were\ndetermined in earlier experiments. A re-evaluation by BES of scan data\nin the region of 2 \u2212 5 GeV [18] applying a model that takes interference\nbetween the resonances into account leads to, in some cases, substantially\naltered parameters for the mass, width, and electronic coupling, owing to\nthe fact that the three higher resonances are broad, and, consequently, interference effects become visible. The \u03c8(3770) results are in line with earlier\nresults of more focussed scans (BES [19]).\nThere are many other members of the charmonium system above openflavor threshold that have not yet been observed. Many of them cannot be\nidentified in direct e+ e\u2212 production because of their quantum numbers; pp\u0304\nscattering or transition from a higher-mass state offer additional avenues.\nIt is important to continue searching for those states in order to compare\nwith and refine predictions for the spectrum of quarkonium states.\n3. Charmonium\n3.1. Spectroscopy\nIn contrast to the somewhat hazy situation of charmonium states above\nopen-flavor threshold, all states below have been observed [11]. Large samples exist for the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S), which are well-studied. The experimental\nfocus is now on comparing the two states, identifying rare decays, and inves-\n\n\f6\n\npic07 \u0307proceedings \u0307mahlke\n\nprinted on November 10, 2018\n\ntigating the resonant substructure in multibody states. As for open charm,\nthis provides information on the intermediate states produced and gives insight into the decay dynamics. The masses and widths are known well. A\nscan of the \u03c8(2S) by E385 [20] led to the current best results on \u0393(\u03c8(2S))\nand \u0393(\u03c8(2S)) \u00d7 B(\u03c8(2S) \u2192 pp\u0304).

The analysis makes use of\nthe beam energy spreach that is comparable to the structure investigated\nas opposed to the MeV range that e+ e\u2212 machines are limited to.\nThe \u03c7cJ states can be studied using the reaction \u03c8(2S) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7cJ , where\nthey are produced at a branching ratio of order 10% each. This implies that\nthe \u03c7cJ data are not far behind the \u03c8(2S) in statistical power, and similar\nstudies as for the \u03c8(2S) are being conducted. Once the transition photon is\nidentified, the \u03c7cJ are easy to handle experimentally. The transition rates\nare affected by relativistic corrections, and thus measuring them accurately\nis important to guide theory. A variety of approaches and models exist; the\nexperimental precision is currently well below the spread of predictions [21].\nThe \u03b7c (1, 2S) and the hc are less well known, and studies to learn more\nabout their properties and decays are underway.\n3.2. Hadronic decays\nBased on the observations that to date much fewer radiative decays have\nbeen observed for the \u03c8(2S) than for the J/\u03c8, and that the ones seen all\nhave branching fractions at the level of 10\u22124 or 10\u22125 while a naive scaling\nleads to the expectation of about 1% for the sum \u03c8(2S) \u2192 \u03b3gg, BES executed a survey of multi-body decay modes with pions and kaons [22]. They\nfound many more signals, but all in the same range as the ones previously\nmeasured. This raises the question whether modes with even higher multiplicity matter as much as to raise the sum to 1%, or whether the naive\nscaling prediction is insufficient.\n3.3. Ties to lighter systems\nDecay or transitions between charmonia provide a lab within which to\nstudy the properties of light mesons. BES [23] searched for the decay\n\u03b7(\u2032 ) \u2192 undetectable final states, where the \u03b7(\u2032 ) is produced in the reaction J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03b7(\u2032 ). The \u03c6 as a narrow resonance is readily identified via\nits decay into a charged kaon pair, and kinematics constrain the recoiling\n\u03b7(\u2032 ) to a narrow region in the missing momentum. No signal is seen; an\nupper limit is placed on the decay of \u03b7(\u2032 ) to invisible final states relative to\ndecay into two photons, which translate into absolute branching fractions\nof \u03b7, \u03b7(\u2032 ) \u2192 invisible of order 10\u22123 and 10\u22124 , respectively.\n\n\fpic07 \u0307proceedings \u0307mahlke\n\nprinted on November 10, 2018\n\n7\n\nCLEO used the transition \u03c8(2S) \u2192 \u03b7J/\u03c8 with J/\u03c8 \u2192 l+ l\u2212 to\nstudy the \u03b7 meson. Branching fractions and ratios thereof [24] were\ndetermined for \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ,\n3\u03c0 0 , \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3, and e+ e\u2212 \u03b3, a first\nfor such a suite of modes within\nthe same experiment. Deviations\nfrom previous determinations were\nobserved for \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 and e+ e\u2212 \u03b3 at\nthe level of three standard deviations. The kinematic properties of\nthe decay and CLEO's resolution\nallow to use the invariant mass of\nthe \u03b7 decay products (except e+ e\u2212 \u03b3,\nwhich has too few events) to determine the \u03b7 mass [25] as a byproduct. The precision achieved is\ncomparable to that of dedicated exFig. 3: World data on the \u03b7 mass.\nperiments (Fig. 3).\n\n4. Conclusions\nCharm continues to provide many interesting avenues to enhance the\nunderstanding of the strong interaction, whether as an open-charm meson\nor a charmonium state. Charm allows to investigate the impact of presence\nof the strong force in weak decays. The system of states provides information about the underlying potential, and hence confirming the existence of\nexpected states and determining spectroscopic parameters is important in\nboth cases. Studying transition and decays provides further insight into the\nproduction mechanism and properties of lighter hadrons generated in the\nreaction. Techniques can be refined in the charm system, where large data\nsamples are available while external input allows to overconstrain the problems, thereby affording a calibration ground for theory techniques which can\nthen be applied to heavier systems. It is mandatory to exploit the charm\ndata samples now for maximal impact at future facilities.\n5.
