Introduction\nThe real nuclear systems, as a rule, contain charged particles. The interplay of\nthe finite-range nuclear and long-range Coulomb forces is one of the fundamental\npeculiarities of the nuclear systems that is responsible for occuring specific phenomena.\nThe Gamow theory of the radioactive decay of heavy nuclei [1, 2] was among first\nadvantageous applications of the quantum mechanics to the description of atomic\nnuclei. According to the theory, the probability of the alpha-decay of a nucleus is\nessentially determined by the probability of the penetration of the \u03b1-particle from\nthe inside of the nucleus where the nuclear force dominates to the outside through\nthe Coulomb barrier of the nucleus. Presence of the Coulomb interaction between\nparticles can also effect essentially on characteristics of nuclear processes involving\ncharged particles, most pronouncedly at low energies.\nOf particular interest is the investigation of the effects of the Coulomb interaction\nfor the simplest nuclear systems at the microscopic level - on the basis of the\nrigorous few-body equations. The application of the few-body approach to the\nproblem of scattering a charged particle by the Coulomb field of a composite bound\nsystem containing charged particles makes it possible to reveal new regularities for\nprocesses initiated by the collision. In particular, this approach enables one to\ninvestigate the influence of the structure of the scattering complex on the magnitude\nof the penetration factor for the Coulomb field of the complex.\nIt is known [3] that the Faddeev integral equations for three particles [4] with\nthe Coulomb interaction between the particles are non-Fredholm at energies above\nthe threshold of the elastic scattering of a particle on a two-particle bound system\nand therefore they must be rebuilt.\n\nFor the problem of the scattering of two\n\ncharged particles, a convenient method of solving the non-Fredholm LippmannSchwinger integral equation with the Coulomb potential that is based on using the\nlimiting transition from the equation with the screened Coulomb potential has been\nelaborated by Gorshkov [5]. Because of the non-Fredholm character of the kernel\nof the two-particle integral equation with the \"pure\" Coulomb potential (in threedimensional formulation), the solution of the scattering problem for two charged\nparticles is known not to be the immediate limiting case of the solution of the\nproblem with the screened Coulomb potential when the screening radius Rs is going\nto infinity. The Gorshkov recipe of the transition consists in extraction explicitly\nfrom the wave function of the system with the screened Coulomb potential of the\nknown exponential Coulomb factor, singular at Rs \u2192 \u221e. The generalization of the\n\n\f-3Gorshkov's recipe for the problem of the scattering of a charged particle on a bound\nsystem consisting of two charged particles has been proposed by Vesselova [6].\nThe appropriate regularized integral equations of the proton-deuteron scattering\nproblem were obtained in the paper [7]. In the frame of the quasi-particle AGS\nformalism [8] the Vesselova method has been also used in the papers [9,10]. A\nfurther numerical calculations have shown the benefit from a correct accounting of\nthe Coulomb effects (especially in the \"inner\" range - in the range of the deuteron\nsystem) using the integral equations method in the momentum space [9,11\u201313] as\nwell as the integro-differential equations method in the configuration space [14].\nAs a result of the analytical study of the effective interaction between a charged\nparticle and two-particle complex on the basis of the Faddeev integral equations, it\nhas been established that the full concellation of the long-range terms proportional\nto (e1 e2 )2 | p \u2212 p\u2032 |\u22121 , (e1 e2 )3 ln(| p \u2212 p\u2032 | \u03c10 ) and (e1 e2 )4 | p \u2212 p\u2032 | occur\nwhen the transfer momentum tends to zero (| p \u2212 p\u2032 |\u2192 0) and the behaviour of\nthe polarization potential at asymptotically large [15\u201318] and intermediate [19\u201320]\ndistances has been determined in an explicit form.\nThe advance in elaboration of the description of the three-particle system\ncontaining charged particles makes it possible to formulate and investigate the\nproblem on the penetration of a charged particle through the Coulomb field of a\ntwo-particle bound system on the mathematically rigorous level.\nIn this paper we develop the first fully consistent three-body approach to the\ndescription of the penetration of a charged particle through the Coulomb field of a\ntwo-fragment bound nucleus. In Section 2 we begin with formulation of this problem as a three-body problem on the Coulomb scattering of a charged particle by\na two-body bound system composed of one charged and one neutral particles. Using the Watson-Feshbach concept of the effective potential we reduce in a rigorous\nway the three-body problem to a definite two-body scattering problem. In Section\n3 we elaborate a three-body formalism for the description of the penetration of a\ncharged particle through the Coulomb field of the two-body nuclear complex. We\nderive a general formula for the relative difference between the penetration factor\nfor the Gamow barrier of a two-fragment nucleus and the penetration factor for the\nCoulomb field of the corresponding point charge and study its behaviour on simplifying assumptions. In Section 4 we calculate the effect of influence of the structure\nof two-fragment nuclei (the deuteron and the lambda-hypernuclei 3\u039b H and 5\u039b He) on\nthe probabilities of penetration of incident charged particles (the meson, the pion,\nthe kaon and the proton) through the Gamow barriers of the nuclei. We summarize\nour results in Section 5.\n\n\f-4-\n\n2. Basic equations for the scattering of a charged particle by the Coulomb\nfield of a two-particle complex\nLet us consider the three-particle problem on the scattering of a charged particle\n1 by a bound complex that consists of two particles - a charged particle 2 and a\nneutral particle 3. (The particle i is characterized by the mass mi and the charge\nei .) In this paper we restrict our consideration to a three-particle system with\ntwo pair interaction potentials - a short-range (nuclear) potential describing the\nN\ninteraction between the particles 2 and 3, v23\n, that provides formation a bound two-\n\nparticle complex, and the long-range Coulomb potential of the interaction between\nC\nthe particles 1 and 2, v12\n. We regard that the particles 1 and 3 do not interact at\n\nall, v31 = 0 . The operator of the potential interaction energy for the considered\nsystem of three particles has the form\nC\nN\nV = v12\n+ v23\n.\n\n(1)\n\nNote, that the description of the three particle system with the potential (1) is\nthe simplest three-particle Coulomb problem. This problem can have an independent physical interest or arise up as an auxiliary problem when finding the integral\nkernels of the modified Faddeev equations for the system containing charged particles [21].\n2.1 Three-particle equations with the screened Coulomb interaction\nTo derive the integral equations for the scattering of a charged particle on a\ntwo-particle complex consisting of a charged and neutral particles, we start from\nthe interaction operator for the three-particle system V\u0304 that contains the screened\nC\nCoulomb pair potential v\u030412\n,\nC\nN\nV\u0304 = v\u030412\n+ v23\n,\n\nC\nC\nv\u030412\n= v12\n* s12 ,\n\n(2)\n\nC\nC\nwhere v12\nis the ordinary \"pure\" Coulomb potential, v12\n(r12 ) = e1 e2 /r12 , and s12\n\nis a screening function that can be chosen in the exponential form: s12 (r12 , Rs ) =\nexp(\u2212r12 /Rs ) , Rs is a parameter that describes the screening distance. Here and\nfurther we mark all quantities, which correspond to the screened Coulomb potential,\nby bar.\nSplitting (correspondingly to the form of the potential operator (2)) the total\nwave function of the three-particle system \u03a8\u0304 into two Faddeev's components,\n\u03a8\u0304 = \u03a8\u0304(23) + \u03a8\u0304(12) ,\n\n(3)\n\n\f-5for the components we obtain the system of the coupled integral equations:\n\u03a8\u0304(23) = \u03a623,1 + G0 (E)T23 (E)\u03a8\u0304(12) ,\n\u03a8\u0304(12) =\n\nC\nG0 (E)T\u030412\n(E)\u03a8\u0304(23) .\n\n(4)\n\n1\n\u22121\nHere, the operator G0 (E) = (E\u2212h23\nis the free three-particle propagator,\n0 \u2212h0 +i0)\n1\n(h23\n0 and h0 are the operators of the kinetic energy of the relative motion of the\n\nparticles 2 and 3 and that of the particle 1 and the centre of mass of the particles\n2 and 3), E is the total energy of the relative motion in the system of three\nC\nparticles, T\u030412\n(E) and T23 (E) are the transition operators that correspond to the\nC\npair interactions v\u030412\nand v23 , respectively, and satisfy to the Lippmann-Schwinger\n\nequations with the free three-particle propagator G0 (E),\nC\nC\nC\nC\nT\u030412\n(E) = v\u030412\n+ v\u030412\nG0 (E)T\u030412\n(E),\n\nT23 (E) = v23 + v23 G0 (E)T23 (E).\n\n(5)\n\nThe free term in Eq.

Numerical results and discussion\nApplying the above-described formalism by the use of the formulae (71), (81) and\n(82)), we have performed calculations of the deviation of the relative penetration\nfactor, \u2206, in specific cases of collision between a charged incident particle of various\nmass (the muon, the pion, the kaon and the proton) and the deuteron and between\nthe proton and the lightest hypernuclei,\n\n3\n\u039bH\n\nand 5\u039b He, which have a well-marked\n\ntwo-fragment structure.\nTo describe the deuteron (as a system of the proton and the neutron in the bound\nS-state), the following values of the parameters of the potential (9),(72) \u03ba \u2261 \u03bapn\nand \u03b2 \u2261 \u03b2pn that correspond to the experimental values of the deuteron binding\nenergy b \u2261 bpn = 2.224575(9) V [28] and the triplet neutron-proton scattering length\natnp = 5.424(3) fm [29] were used\n\u03bapn = 0.23161 fm\u22121 , \u03b2pn = 1.3906 fm\u22121 .\n\n(98)\n\nIn a similar way we fit the parameters of the potentials of the form (9), (72)\nthat support the hypernuclei 3\u039b H and 5\u039b He. The parameters \u03ba \u2261 \u03bad\u039b and \u03b2 \u2261 \u03b2d\u039b\nproviding the existence of the bound S-state of the hypertriton 3\u039b H as a two-fragment\nsystem that consists of the deuteron and the \u039b-hyperon, we find based on the\nexperimental value of the binding energy of the hypertriton, b \u2261 bd\u039b = 0.13(5)\nMeV [30], and the value of the doublet \u039b-hyperon-deuteron scattering length add\u039b\n= 15.9 fm. The latter follows from the correlation dependence add\u039b on bd\u039b that has\nbeen calculated in the paper [31] (see also Ref. [32]) on the basis of the threeparticle description of the hypertriton as a system of the proton, the neutron and\nthe \u039b-hyperon with the use of the known experimental low-energy data on p-n and\n\u039b\u2212nucleon interaction. We find in this case\n\u03bad\u039b = 0.06834 fm\u22121 , \u03b2d\u039b = 1.1938 fm\u22121 .\n\n(99)\n\nFor the hypernucleus 5\u039b He as a two-fragment system composed of the \u03b1-particle\nand \u039b-hyperon, we find the values of the parameter \u03ba \u2261 \u03ba\u03b1\u039b that corresponds to\n\n\f- 22 the experimental binding energy of the nucleus 5\u039b He, b = b\u03b1\u039b = 3.12(2) MeV [30],\nand the parameter \u03b2 \u2261 \u03b2\u03b1\u039b , that (together with the experimental b\u03b1\u039b ) reproduces\n1/2\n\nthe value of the root-mean-square radius of the bound system 5\u039b He, hr 2 i\u03b1\u039b = 2.43\nfm, calculated with the use of a potential model of \u03b1 \u2212 \u039b interaction proposed in\nthe paper [33],\n\u03ba\u03b1\u039b = 0.37094 fm\u22121 , \u03b2\u03b1\u039b = 2.177 fm\u22121 .\n\n(100)\n\nThe results of our calculation of the function A(p0 ), which characterizes the\nstructure of each one of the considered two-fragment nuclear systems, the deuteron\nand two hypernuclei, 3\u039b H and 5\u039b He, are shown in Fig.1. The solid lines in the figure\nare obtained according to the formulae (81) and (82), which correspond to the\nseparable potential of interaction between fragments of the nuclear complex (9),\n(72) with the parameters (98)-(100), while the dotted lines are obtained for the\nzero-range interaction (\u03b2 \u2192 \u221e). It follows from the definition (76),(77) that the\nfunction A(p0 ) rises as the incident momentum p0 increases. The value of A(p0 )\ndepends essentially on the binding energy of the two-fragment system, increasing\nwhen going to a system with a lesser binding energy. Hence, the curve A(p0 ) for the\ndeuteron is shifted up relative to the curve for the nucleus 5\u039b He, as does the curve\nfor the nucleus 3\u039b H relative to the curve for the deuteron. From the side of small\nvalues of p0 in the range (96), the behaviour of A(p0 ) appears to be near linear in\naccordance with the result of our approximate estimate (92), the slope of the straght\nline being proportional to the radius of the corresponding two-fragment complex R.\nFor each nuclear complex the curve A(p0 ) calculated with the finite-range interaction\nis shifted up in comparison of that calculated with the zero-range interaction.\nIn the Table 1 and the Figures 2-4, we present our numerical results for the\nrelative deviation of the penetration factor for the Coulomb field of the two-fragment\nnucleus from the penetration factor for the Coulomb field of the corresponding point\ncharge, \u2206, in relation to the incident momentum p0 , which have been obtained by\nusing the expressions (71), (81) and (82) 2 . The calculations have been performed\nfor the charged incident particle of various mass (the muon, the pion, the kaon\nand the proton) colliding with the deuteron and for the proton colliding with the\nhypernuclei 3\u039b H and 5\u039b He.\nThe obtained values of \u2206 for \u03bc \u2212 d, \u03c0 \u2212 d, K \u2212 d and p \u2212 d interactions differ\nfrom each other, since, to begin with, the incident particles have different masses,\nm1 , in this case \u2206 increases with increasing \u03bc1 . Also, as the data of the Table 1\nand the Fig. 4 indicate, the quantity \u2206 depends essentially on the binding energy of\n2\n\nNote that the data for \u2206 reported in the table of Ref.

Comparing the results for\np\u2212d, p\u22123\u039b H and p\u22125\u039b He interactions between themselves, it should be remembered\nthat in this case an additional doubling \u2206 for p \u22125\u039b He caused by that the charged\nfragment of the hypernucleus 5\u039b He (the \u03b1-particle 42 He ) has its charge twice as large\nas the charged fragments of the deuteron or the hypertriton.\nFor comparison, in the Table 2 we give the values of the relative deviation \u2206\ncalculated in the simple approximation (93) which is independent of the incident\nmomentum p0 and may be applied for values of the momentum p0 in the range (96).\nThe result for \u2206 in the explicit analytical form (93) is obtained by approximate\nintegration in the formula (76) using the expansion of the function (77) in the\npowers of \u03be (88) with the parameter \u03be taking the values\nm3 p0\n,\nm23 \u03ba\n\n2\n\nm3 p0\n,\nm23 \u03ba + \u03b2\n\nor\n\nm3 p0\n.\nm23 \u03b2\n\nThe greater the binding energy of the two-fragment system, the more it is accurate\nthe approximate integration and the wider it is the range of values of the momentum\np0 for which this approximation is valid. This is evident comparing the data in the\nTable 2 with the data of the direct numerical integration listed in the Table 1:\nthe mentioned approximation is appropriate in the widest range of p0 for the most\nstrongly bounded two-fragment nucleus 5\u039b He .\nNotice that the calculation data obtained in this work embrace energies both\nbelow and above the Coulomb barrier of the electrostatic repulsion energy between\nthe positively charged projectile and nucleus \u01ebb =| e1 e2 | /R.

Summary\nThis paper is devoted to formulation of a consistent three-body approach to\nthe description of the phenomenon of the penetration of a charged particle through\nthe Coulomb field of a two-fragment (nuclear) complex consisted of one charged\nand one neutral particles in a bound state. The corresponding formalism has been\nconstructed on the basis of the use of the three-body Faddeev method and the\nWatson-Feshbach technique for introducing the effective (optical) potential of the\ninteraction between a particle and a bound system.\nIn view of the presence of the long-range Coulomb interaction, the corresponding\nFaddeev integral equations are non-Fredholm above the threshold of the elastic\nparticle-complex scattering, in this connection our study starts with the use of the\n\n\f- 24 screened Coulomb interaction. The passage to the limit of the non-screened Coulomb\npotential and the regularization of the obtained equations have been performed in\naccordance with the Gorshkov-Vesselova recipe by way of the explicit isolation and\nremoval of the known singular exponential Coulomb factor.\nThe three-body formalism that describes the penetration of the charged particle\nthrough the Coulomb field of a two-particle complex has been worked out in the\ngeneral case for both attractive and repulsive fields. The formula for the relative\ndeviation \u2206 of the penetration factor for the Coulomb field of the two-particle\ncomplex from the penetration factor for the Coulomb field of the corresponding\npoint charge has been derived.\nAs a first step to the application of the developed formalism, we have derived a\nsimple analytic expression for the relative deviation \u2206 by approximation the function\nD(\u03b7, p0) with the linear term of the expansion of D as a power series in \u03b7, the\nSommerfeld parameter for the Coulomb interaction between the particle and the\ncentre of mass of the complex, when | \u03b7 |< 1. In this case, the correction for the\nstructure of the complex, \u2206, was found to be positive for the repulsive Coulomb\ninteraction between the charged particle and negative for the attractive Coulomb\ninteraction. By way of illustration, the influence of the nucleus structure on the\nprobability of the coming together of a charged particle (the muon, the pion, the kaon\nand the proton) and a two-fragment nucleus (the deuteron and the \u039b-hypernuclei\n3\n\u039bH\n\nand 5\u039b He) has been studied. The calculated values of the relative deviation \u2206 (by\n\nthe formulae (71),(81) and (82)) are given in the Table 1 and shown in the Figures\n2\u20134. The quantity \u2206 is proportional to the mass of the incident particle m1 and to\nthe charges of the incident particle and complex, e1 and e2 , it depends essentially\non the binding energy of the complex b, increasing with decreasing b. It has been\nfound that the value of the correction for the structure, \u2206, calculated according to\nthe model of the finite-range nuclear interaction exceeds noticeably the value of the\ncorresponding correction for the structure \u2206zr , calculated with the use of the model\nof the zero-range interaction, | \u2206 |>| \u2206zr | (see the data of the Tables 1 and 2).\nA simple estimation of the influence of the two-fragment complex on the\nprobability of the penetration of a charged particle through the Gamow field of\nthe complex has been made for a range of small values of the incident momentum\np0 (relative to the momentum \u03ba that corresponds to the binding energy of the twobody complex, b). By expanding the function a(\u03be) in Eq. (76) in the parameter \u03be\nwith the proviso that \u03be < 1 and taking the first four terms of the expansion into\nconsideration, the function \u2206(p0 ) has been approximated by the expression (94).\nIn this approximation, the function \u2206(p0 ) appears to be independent of p0 and the\n\n\f- 25 magnitude of \u2206 is determined by the ratio of the mean radius of the two-particle\ncomplex R to the Bohr radius of an atom composing of the incident particle and\ncomplex, aB .\nThe three-body formalism given in this paper can be generalized to other cases\nwhen both of fragments of the complex are charged and thus applied to research the\npenetration of charged particles through the Coulomb fields of nuclear, atomic and\nmolecular systems.\n\n\f- 26 1 G.A.
