INTRODUCTION\nIRC\u221210443 (= RAFGL 2209 = NSV 11129 = BD\u221212\u25e6 5123) is a bright (K=1.8\nmag) infrared source discovered during the Two Micron Sky Survey (Neugebauer\nand Leighton 1969), that lies in the general direction of the Scutum Star Cloud.\nIRC\u221210443 was detected by the AFGL survey (Price and Murdock 1983) at\n4.2 \u03bcm, and by IRAS satellite at 12 and 25 \u03bcm. Its 2MASS magnitudes and\ncolors are Ks =1.92, J \u2212 H=1.35, J \u2212 K=1.80. Its spectral type is reported to\nbe M6 by Neckel (1958) and Hansen and Blanco (1975), and M6.5 by Nassau\net al. (1956). IRC\u221210443 is present in the NSV catalog of suspected variables\nbecause I-band observations, obtained at five different epochs (from 21-08-1963\nto 28-06-1965) which are reported in the IRC catalog, seem to trace a variation\n\n\f2\nfrom magnitude 6.4 to 6.9 (however, the uncertainty of the single measurement is\nsimilar to the dispersion of the five IRC measurements around their mean). Not\nmuch more is known about IRC\u221210443 and its nature. In this paper we report\non our BV I photometric monitoring (85 nights distributed over two years) and\noptical spectroscopic observations (low and high resolution) of this object, and\nhow they constrain its basic properties.\n2. OBSERVATIONS\n2.1. Photometry\nBV IC CCD photometry of IRC\u221210443 was independently obtained with two\nseparate telescopes: (a) the 0.30-m Meade RCX-400 f/8 Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope owned by Associazione Astrofili Valle di Cembra (Trento, Italy). The CCD\nwas a SBIG ST-9, 512\u00d7512 array, 20 \u03bcm pixels \u22611.72\u2032\u2032 /pix, with a field of view of\n13\u2032 \u00d713\u2032 . The B filter was from Omega and the V IC filters from Custom Scientific;\nand (b) the 0.50-m f/8 Ritchey-Cretien telescope operated on top of Mt. Zugna by\nMuseo Civico di Rovereto (Trento, Italy) and equipped with Optec BV IC filters.\nThe CCD was an Apogee Alta U42 2048\u00d72048 array, 13.5 \u03bcm pixels \u2261 0.70\u2032\u2032 /pix,\nwith a field of view of 24\u2032 \u00d724\u2032 .\nThe comparison star for B and V bands was TYC 5699-6341-1, for which we\nadopted B=11.016 and V =10.334 in the standard Johnson U BV system. They\nwere obtained from Tycho BT ,VT data following Bessell (2000) transformations.\nThe comparison star for IC band was TYC 5699-6348-1 for which we adopted\nIC =6.39, V \u2212 IC =0.55 from the Hipparcos catalog. We had no alternatives for the\ncomparison stars. In fact, these two are the only stars within the CCD field of\nview of IRC\u221210443 that (i) have reference magnitudes available in literature, (ii)\nare bright enough to be well exposed on the single CCD image without risking to\nsaturate IRC\u221210443, and (iii) are photometrically stable to better than 0.02 mag.\nThe last point was verified by noting that on all frames in any band we obtained,\nthe relative magnitude of the two comparison stars was stable at this level.\nAll photometric measurements were corrected for instrumental color equations\nderived nightly by observations of Landolt (1992) standard fields. The good consistency of the data obtained independently with two different instruments reinforce\nour confidence in the accuracy of the results, in spite of the very red colors of\nIRC\u221210443, that are not reached by typical Landolt standard stars. Our photometry is presented in Table 1. It covers the period from 16-07-2006 to 11-07-2008,\nwith observations collected in 85 different nights. The Poissonian component of\nthe total error budget is less than 0.01 mag for all the data. The r.m.s. of the\nLandolt standard stars around the color equations they contributed to calibrate\nwas on the average 0.019 mag for B, 0.022 for V and 0.031 for IC bands.\n2.2. Spectroscopy\nA low resolution, absolutely fluxed spectrum of IRC\u221210443 was obtained on\nJune 24.97, 2008 UT with the B&C spectrograph of INAF Astronomical Observatory of Padova attached to the 1.22m telescope operated in Asiago by the\nDepartment of Astronomy of the University of Padova. The slit, aligned with the\nparallactic angle, projected onto 2 arcsec on the sky, and the total exposure time\nwas 1860 sec.

Photometric variability\nThe light-curve presented in Figure 1 clearly shows that IRC\u221210443 is indeed\nvariable. The recorded variability amounts to \u2206B=1.27 (from 14.41 to 13.14),\n\u2206V =1.14 (from 11.89 to 10.75) and \u2206IC =0.70 (from 6.45 to 5.75), around the\nmean values <B>=13.75, <V >=11.33 and <IC >=6.18 mag.\nThe variability is obviously periodic (see next section) and Figure 1 shows that\nthe stars gets hotter (bluest V \u2212 IC ) at V maxima, and cooler (reddest V \u2212 IC ) at\nV minima. This behavior of the color is a distinctive features of stellar pulsation.\n\n\f5\nIn fact, Figure 2 plots the V \u2212\nIC color against the V magnitude,\nshowing the clear correlation between\nthem. If we take a black-body, redden it by EB\u2212V =0.87, scale its flux so\nto match the average V band brightness of IRC\u221210443, and let it varies\nat constant luminosity, we obtain the\nline in Figure 2, which is a reasonably good fit to the observed points.\nThis indicates that the variability\ndisplayed by IRC\u221210443 occurs at\nconstant luminosity, in the form of\nexpansion + cooling and contraction\n+ warming, as expected in radial pulsations. The corresponding variation\nFig. 2. Brightness-color diagram for the in spectral type goes from M6.6 III\nobservations in Figure 1. The line is the to M7.5 III as indicated on the right\npath followed by a black-body, reddened ordinate axis of Figure 2. These corby EB\u2212V =0.87, varying in radius and\nresponding spectral types have been\ntemperature at constant luminosity.\nobtained by integrating the V and IC\nbands on the Fluks et al. (1994) spectra of M III giants reddened by EB\u2212V =0.87\n(the amount affecting IRC\u221210443, see sect. 3.4)\nIRC\u221210443 appears as a bona fide SRa variable. SRa variables are semiregular late-type (M, C, S or Me, Ce, Se) giants displaying persistent periodicity\nand usually small (\u2206V <2.5 mag) light amplitudes. Amplitudes and light-curve\nshapes generally vary and periods are in the range 35-1200 days. Many SRa differ\nfrom Miras only by showing smaller light amplitudes (Whitelock 1996).\n3.2. Multi periodicities\nTwo main periodicities are at the same time present in IRC\u221210443: a principal\nand larger amplitude variation modulated by a 85.5 day period, and a secondary\nand smaller one of 620 days. The following expression corresponds to the curve\nfitting the V -band data in Figure 3 (where t is in HJD \u2212 2450000):\nV (t) = 11.38(\u00b10.02) + 0.41(\u00b10.02) sin\n\nt \u2212 4042.0(\u00b10.3)\n+\n85.5(\u00b10.2)\n\nt \u2212 4141(\u00b110)\n(1)\n620(\u00b115)\nThe combination of these two plain sinusoids provides a reasonably close fitting\nto the observed light-curve. Nevertheless, the residuals are larger than the observational errors, and an additional weaker component (either periodic or irregular)\nis probably present. Our present data are insufficient to characterize such an additional component, and to resolve it a much longer photometric monitoring is\nrequired, which we plan to pursue.\n+ 0.22(\u00b10.02) sin\n\n3.3. Spectral classification and radial velocity\nThe low resolution spectrum we obtained of IRC \u221210443 was compared with\nthe digital spectral atlas of Fluks et al. (1994), that includes all spectral types from\n\n\f6\n\nFig. 3. Fitting of the V and V \u2212 IC light-curves of IRC\u221210443 with two\nsinusoids of 85.5 and 620 days periods (see sects. 3.2, 3.6 and Eq. 1).\nM0 to M10 with spectra covering the whole optical range. They are of high flux\naccuracy and of a resolution similar to ours. Literature data suggest a M6/M6.5\nspectral type for IRC\u221210443, but our spectrum is quite poorly fitted by the M6III\nreference spectrum from Fluks et al. (1994) library, while the match is perfect\nwith a M7III spectrum, as shown in Figure 4. In view of the pulsation activity\npresent in IRC\u221210443, the difference between our and other spectral classifications\npresent in literature can be accounted for by the changes in surface temperature\nthat characterize the pulsation activity (see right hand-side ordinates of Figure 2).\nFigure 5 displays a portion centered on H\u03b1 of our high resolution Echelle\nspectrum of IRC\u221210443 for July 22.95, and by comparison those of bracketing\nspectral types from the atlas of Bagnulo et al. (2003), degraded to the resolution\nof our Echelle spectrum via a Gaussian filter. The spectral progression in Figure 5\nconfirms the M7III classification for IRC\u221210443.\nMira variables displays emission lines, mainly the higher lines in the Balmer\nseries, peaking in intensity at maximum brightness for both O- and C-rich varieties\n(e.g. Panchuk 1978, Yamashita et al. 1977, Mikulasek and Graf 2005), with large\nexcursion in intensity along the pulsation cycle. When the first Echelle spectrum\nwas exposed on June 10, IRC\u221210443 was on the rise and close to maximum brightness (pulsation phase 0.86), while for the July 22 spectrum it was declining and\nclose to minimum brightness (pulsation phase 0.37). Both spectra do not show\nemission in the H\u03b1 line, in agreement with the fact that the presence of emission\nlines is far less frequent in SR than in Mira variables.\nThe radial velocity of the M7III star is \u221224.1(\u00b10.8) and \u221231.4(\u00b10.7) km/s on\nthe June 10 and July 22 spectra, respectively. The difference is well accounted\n\n\f7\nfor by the pulsation activity. The two observations are separated in time by\nexactly half of the main 85.5 day pulsation period, and their mean value \u221228 km/s\ncan be taken as representative of the systemic velocity of IRC\u221210443. At its\ngalactic coordinates (l=20\u25e6, b=\u22123\u25e6 ) and distance (0.5 kpc, see below), the radial\nvelocity expected from galactic disk rotation is +7 km/s (cf also Brand and Blitz\n1993). The 35 km/s difference with the observed radial velocity, suggests that\nIRC\u221210443 does not belong to the young disk galactic population onto which it is\nseen projected and instead it is related to an older population. This is confirmed\nby the high tangential velocity, 86 km/s, derived from the proper motion listed in\nthe NOMAD catalog (Zacharias et al. 2004) and the distance estimated in sect. 3.5\nbelow.\n3.4. Reddening\nThe fit with the Flucks et al. (1994) M7III reference spectrum presented in Figure 4 constrains the reddening affecting IRC\u221210443. The best match is obtained\nwith EB\u2212V =0.87\u00b10.02 for a standard RV =3.1 reddening law.\nThe intrinsic B \u2212 V color of M giants does not depend from the spectral type\nand hence the effective temperature, as illustrated by Johnson (1966), Lee (1970)\nand Fitzgerald (1970). Their tabular compilations provide <(B \u2212 V )\u25e6 >=+1.544\nas the mean intrinsic color of M5 to M8 class III giants. The mean B \u2212 V color\nof our observations is < (B \u2212 V ) >=+2.418, which corresponds to a reddening\nEB\u2212V =0.87\u00b10.04 affecting IRC 10443.\nThese two independent methods converge to the same amount of reddening\naffecting IRC 10443, EB\u2212V =0.87\u00b10.03, which is adopted in this paper. A fraction\nof this total reddening is probably of circumstellar origin, as supported by the\ndetection by Kwok et al. (1997) of emission from circumstellar dust in IRAS low\nresolution spectra. IRC\u221210443 lies in the general direction of the Scutum Star\nCloud (SSC, centered at l=27\u25e6, b=\u22123\u25e6 galactic coordinates). SSC is one of the\nregions of the Milky Way with the highest stellar density, caused by unusually low\nextinction over its area. Reichen et al. (1990) presented the results of a detailed\ninvestigation of the extinction over the SSC based on ground-based and balloonborn UV survey data. Toward the direction to IRC\u221210443 they found that the\ninterstellar reddening linearly increases with distance until EB\u2212V \u223c0.55 is reached\nat 0.5 kpc. Longward, the further rise of the reddening with distance is very slow,\nreaching EB\u2212V \u223c0.65 at 4 kpc. Only for distances d>6 kpc the reddening increases\nto EB\u2212V \u223c1 (Madsen and Reynolds 2005).\nFollowing the results of Reichen et al. (1990), we therefore conclude that \u223c1/3\nof the total EB\u2212V =0.87 reddening affecting IRC\u221210443, is of probable circumstellar origin.\n3.5. Distance\nIn a seminal paper, Wood et al. (1999) used MACHO observations of late-type\ngiant variables in LMC to produce a period-luminosity diagram for them, where\nfive separate period-luminosity sequences were identified. Comparing with the\nmodel prediction of Wood and Sebo (1996), three of these sequences were found\nto coincide with the fundamental and first overtones pulsation modes, while the\nother two seemed to trace the variability induced by ellipsoidal distortion of RGB\nand AGB giants harbored in binary systems.\nSince then, the availability of huge sets of data from large micro-lensing sur-\n\n\f8\n\nFig. 4. Absolute spectro-photometry of IRC\u221210443 for 24.97 June 2008 UT\n(thick line) with superimposed the reference spectrum of a M7III star from the\natlas of Fluks et al. (1994) reddened by EB\u2212V =0.87 (thin line).\nveys (MACHO, OGLE, EROS, MOA) contributed to rapidly refine the picture,\nwith now up to 14 different period-luminosity sequences identified (e.g. Kiss and\nBedding 2003, Ita et al. 2004, Soszynski et al. 2005, Soszynski et al. 2007).\nThe most recent calibration of the various period-luminosity relations for latetype giant variables has been presented by Soszynski et al. (2007). Their relation\nfor O-rich semi-regular variables of LMC takes the form Ks = \u22124.35(log P \u2212\n2.0) + 11.25, where Ks band is that of the 2MASS survey. Whitelock et al. (2008)\nhave shown that any chemical abundance effect on the K-band period-luminosity\nrelation of Miras must be small. Working with the revised Hipparcos parallaxes of\nvan Leeuwen (2007), Whitelock et al. (2008) have derived that period-luminosity\nrelation of O-rich Miras in our Galaxy has the same slope and it is 0.1 mag brighter\nthan the corresponding one for the LMC. We assume that a similar 0.1 mag shift\nwould make the Soszynski et al. (2007) relations applicable to the O-rich SRa\nvariables of our Galaxy. Adopting this 0.1 mag shift, a LMC distance modulus\nof (m - M)\u25e6 =18.39 (van Leeuwen et al. 2007), a LMC reddening of EB\u2212V =0.06\n(Mateo 1998), the extinction relation AKs = 0.442EB\u2212V for an M-type spectral\ndistribution and a standard RV =3.1 extinction law (Fiorucci and Munari 2003),\nthe distance to IRC\u221210443 corresponding to the 85.5 day period is 0.5 kpc.\nSoszynski et al. (2007) relation for the long secondary periods of O-rich red giants\nin LMC takes the form Ks = \u22124.41(log P \u2212 2.0) + 15.05, and when applied (with\nthe same 0.1 mag shift as above) to the 620 day secondary periodicity displayed\nby IRC\u221210443, it provides the same distance, 0.5 kpc, as obtained for the 85.5\nday main period. Such 0.5 kpc distance is adopted for IRC\u221210443 in this paper.\n3.6. On the nature of the long secondary period\nIn spite of large investigation efforts, both observational and theoretical, \"the\ncause of the long secondary periods seen in cool giants remains a mystery at the\npresent time\" as recently remarked by Wood (2007).\nIt has been known for a long time that some semi-regular variables shows\nthe presence of a long secondary period (LSP) in their light-curves, typically ten\n\n\f9\ntimes longer than the primary pulsation period. This ratio for IRC\u221210443 is 7.25.\nLists of local giants displaying LSPs have been published, among others, by Houk\n(1963), Mattei et al. (1997), Kiss et al. (1999). Wood et al. (1999) found that\n\u223c25% of all variable AGB star in LMC show LSPs. A similar fraction, \u224330%, of\nlocal semi-regular variables has been found by Percy et al. (2004) to display LSPs.\nThe semi-regular variables\nappear to pulsate in the\nfirst overtone (Lebzelter and\nWood 2006), and thus it\ncould be tempting to relate\nthe LSPs with pulsation in\nthe fundamental mode. However, as found in theoretical models by Fox and Wood\n(1982) and verified by observations (e.g. Kiss et al.\n1999, Mattei et al. 1997),\nthe ratio of fundamental to\nfist overtone periods is close\nto two, ruling out that LSPs\nare due to pulsations in the\nfundamental mode. Established observational facts are\nthat LSPs are accompanied\nby radial velocity variations\n(of a lower amplitude than\nobserved for the primary peFig. 5. Portion, centered on H\u03b1 and CaI 6572.8,\nriod; Hinkle et al. 2002,\nof the high resolution 22.95 July 2008 Echelle\nWood et al. 2004) and by\nspectrum of IRC\u221210443. Spectra of cool giants\nvariation in intensity of the\nfrom Bagnulo et al. (2003) are plotted for\nreference. All spectra are continuum normalized, H\u03b1 absorption (that could\noffset in ordinates for better visibility, and shifted trace a variable filling by an\nto 0.0 radial velocity.\nemission component of chromospheric origin; Wood et al.\n2004). In addition, cool variable giants showing LSPs rotate at similar velocity\nand show similar dust-free IRAS colors as cool variable giants not showing the\nLSPs (Olivier and Wood 2003). In RGB objects showing LSPs, the period of associated radial velocity variations is twice the period of photometric LSP variability\n(as expected in the case LSPs arise from ellipsoidally distorted giants in binary\nsystems; Adams et al. 2006), while in AGB objects the period is the same (as\nexpected in the case of pulsations; Wood et al. 2004). Various explanations of the\nLSP phenomenon have been proposed, but all have encountered some problems,\nas discussed by Wood (2007, and references therein).\nA striking feature displayed by IRC\u221210443 is illustrated in the bottom panel of\nFigure 3, where the color variation is fitted with two sinusoids of the same periods\nof those fitting the V light-curve (cf Eq. 1 and the top-panel of Figure 3). Their\nsemi-amplitudes are 0.23 mag for the sinusoid associated to the principal 85.5 day\nperiod, and 0.13 mag for the LSP, with a mean V \u2212 IC =5.19. From Figure 3, it\nis evident that IRC\u221210443 is bluest when it is at the maximum brightness along\n\n\f10\nthe LSP cycle, and reddest when it is at the minimum brightness. This is the\nsame pattern observed for the principal 85.5 day period and strongly argues in\nfavor of a pulsation interpretation of LSP phenomenon, at least in IRC\u221210443.\nThe simultaneous presence of two pulsations also accounts for the dispersion of\nthe points in Figure 2 along the back-body curve. The dispersion would have been\nsignificantly reduced if only one pulsation would have been present, as confirmed\nby removing from observations one or the other of the sinusoidal variation of the\ncolor and re-plotting Figure 2.\nThe variation in V \u2212 IC color can be transformed into variation in effective\ntemperature of the underlying stellar photosphere using the reference continuum\nenergy distribution given by Fluks et al. (1994) along the spectral sequence of\nM giants. The total amplitude of 0.46 mag observed in V \u2212 IC for the principal\nperiod, corresponds to a change in 0.73 spectral types around the M7III mean,\nand therefore to a variation from 3030 to 3175 K in effective temperature. The\n0.26 mag total color amplitude of the LSP would correspond to a change of 0.41\nspectral types around the M7III mean, meaning a variation from 3060 to 3145 K.\nIf both pulsations are supposed to occur at constant luminosity, the corresponding\ntotal excursion in radius is \u223c10% for the principal 85.5 day period, and \u223c6% for\nthe LSP.\nThese excursions in radius are less than that inferred by Wood et al. (2004)\nfrom radial velocity observations at optical wavelengths of a sample of three hotter AGB stars characterized by longer LSP than IRC\u221210443. We estimated the\nchange in effective temperature and radius of the underlying photosphere. If instead we had referred to a black-body fitting of the observed optical spectrum\nof the star (re-shaped by the extremely strong TiO molecular absorptions), the\nvariation in color temperature and radius of IRC\u221210443 would have been almost\ntwice larger, 150 K and 10 %, respectively.\nIt is worth noticing that recent theoretical improvements in the treatment of\npulsation, like inclusion of time dependent turbulent convection (Olivier and Wood\n2006), are opening new modeling possibilities for pulsation modes in cool giants.\nImportant applications to the long lasting problem of what is driving the LSPs\ncould be obtained in the near future (cf. Wood 2006). To better characterize the\nobject and increase its interest as a test target for current theories, we plan to\ncontinue a tight observational monitoring of IRC\u221210443 over the next years, long\nenough to cover at least the whole next LSP period.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS.
