The formula is\nequivalent to a formula of Levitov and Lesovik in the finite dimensional case and may be\nviewed as its regularized form in general. Our result embodies two tenets often realized\nin mesoscopic physics, namely, that the transport properties are essentially independent\nof the length of the leads and of the depth of the Fermi sea.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nModels of physical systems are often formulated with the help of one or few parameters which\nguarantee that whatever one computes is well defined and finite while, at the same time, are\nbelieved not to affect properties of physical interest. Examples are: The number of particles\nin a macroscopic system, and the lattice spacing (ultraviolet cutoffs) in the study of critical\nphenomena.\nThe theory of transport in mesoscopic systems has two such parameters: The length of the\nincoming leads that connect to the system and the depth of the Fermi sea. The independence\n1\n\n\fof the length of the leads is the statement that well designed experiments measure the transport properties of the mesoscopic system and are independent of the measuring circuit. The\nindependence of the depth of the Fermi sea expresses the irrelevance for transport of electrons\nthat are buried deep in the Fermi sea, since in most situations they can not be excited above\nit. In this sense there is freedom from both the volume and the ultraviolet scale. See [21] for\na numerical investigation of these properties.\nOne strategy to address this type of behavior is to consider idealized systems where the\nparameters are taken to be infinitely large. The limiting idealized system comes with the\nprice tag that expressions for physical quantities that are otherwise guaranteed to be finite,\nmay become ambiguous, formal and even infinite. The value in worrying about this idealized,\npossibly un-physical system, is precisely in that once the ambiguities and infinities are resolved, they teach us something important about the finite physical model, namely, that the\nparameters used in its formulation, do indeed effectively disappear from the physical properties. Their role is effectively reduced to the control of the small differences between the\nidealized model and the physical one.\nWe shall consider a problem of this kind that arises in the context of modeling the statistics\nof charge transport from one reservoir to another. Levitov and Lesovik [13] wrote a formula for\nthe appropriate generating function in terms of a certain infinite dimensional determinant.\nThe formula has found a number of applications to shot and thermal noise in devices like\ntransmission barriers, cavities, and interfaces. When one wants to apply this formula to\nthe idealized cases one finds ambiguities and, as emphasized by Levitov et al. [12, 8, 11],\nthe determinant requires proper definition through regularization. We intend to further the\nunderstanding of these points by providing an alternative, mathematically consistent, form\nfor the determinant. As we shall see, the \"regularized form\" of the determinant naturally\nemerges once the quantum dynamics is formulated on the state space of the idealized system.\nIn the next section we introduce the statistics of charge transport, review the LevitovLesovik determinant, and propose a regularization. In Section 3 we state the main results.\nSection 4 is devoted to proofs and begins with a short overview thereof. Finally, Section 5\nexemplifies the assumptions made in this work.\n\n2\n\nThe Levitov-Lesovik formula and its regularization\n\nWe consider a lead, where independent electrons are evolved over some time interval and ask\nabout the statistics of the charge transferred from the left to the right portion of the lead.\n2\n\n\fTo begin, we recall the result obtained in [13] and further elaborated in [12, 8]. We present\nits derivation and generalization to finite times along the heuristic lines given in [10], in the\nsense that we do as if the one-particle Hilbert space H were finite-dimensional.\nThe fermionic Fock space F over H contains a distinguished state, the vacuum, with\nthe physical interpretation of a no particle state. Let Tr, resp. tr, denote the trace on F ,\nresp. H. Let U be the unitary on H representing the time evolution, and Q the projection\ncorresponding to the right portion of the lead. Their second quantizations, \u0393(U) = \u2227ki=1 Ui ,\nP\nresp. d\u0393(Q) = ki=1 Qi on k-particle states, then stand for the evolution on F , resp. for the\ncharge in that portion. We suppose that the initial many particle (mixed) state is of the form\nP = Z \u22121 \u0393(M)\nfor some operator M \u2265 0, where Z = Tr \u0393(M) = det(1 + M) ensures that TrP = 1. The\nreduced one-particle density matrix N is defined by the property that\ntr(AN) = Tr (d\u0393(A)P )\nfor any one-particle operator A on H. In our case, N = M(1 + M)\u22121 . This follows from\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001 det(1 + ei\u03bbA M)\nTr ei\u03bbd\u0393(A) P = Tr \u0393(ei\u03bbA )P = Z \u22121 Tr \u0393(ei\u03bbA M) =\ndet(1 + M)\n= det(1 \u2212 N + ei\u03bbA N)\n\n(1)\n\nby taking the derivative at \u03bb = 0.\nIn the following, we assume that M and Q, and hence P and d\u0393(Q), commute, which\nphysically means that in the state defined by P , charge in the lead measured by Q is a good\nquantum number. Hence\nP |\u03b1i = \u03c1\u03b1 |\u03b1i ,\n\nd\u0393(Q)|\u03b1i = n\u03b1 |\u03b1i ,\n\nfor some basis {|\u03b1i} of F . The moment generating function for the charge transfer statistics\nis\nX\n\u03c7(\u03bb) =\npn ei\u03bbn ,\nn\u2208Z\n\nwhere pn is the probability for n electrons being deposited into the right portion of the lead\nby the end of the time interval. It may be computed as a sum over initial and final states, \u03b1\n3\n\n\fresp. \u03b2, with the former weighted according to their probabilities \u03c1\u03b1 :\nX\n\u0001\n\u03c7(\u03bb) =\n|h\u03b2|\u0393(U)|\u03b1i|2 \u03c1\u03b1 ei\u03bb(n\u03b2 \u2212n\u03b1 ) = Tr \u0393(U)\u2217 ei\u03bbd\u0393(Q) \u0393(U)e\u2212i\u03bbd\u0393(Q) P\n\n(2)\n\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2217\n= Z \u22121 Tr \u0393(U \u2217 ei\u03bbQ Ue\u2212i\u03bbQ M) = det 1 \u2212 N + ei\u03bbU QU Ne\u2212i\u03bbQ ,\nP\nwhere the trace has been computed in the basis |\u03b1i, with an identity\n|\u03b2ih\u03b2| = 1 absorbed\nat the left of \u0393(U); the last equality is by (1). This is the Levitov-Lesovik formula:\n\u03c7(\u03bb) = det D(\u03bb) ,\n\nD(\u03bb) = N \u2032 + ei\u03bbQU Ne\u2212i\u03bbQ ,\n\n(3)\n\nwith N \u2032 = 1 \u2212 N and QU = U \u2217 QU. Since Q is a projection, e2\u03c0iQ = e2\u03c0iQU = 1 and D(\u03bb) is a\nperiodic function with period 2\u03c0. This expresses the integrality of charge transport.\nAn example of a state of interest is that of a system at inverse temperature \u03b2 having oneparticle Hamiltonian H; it is P = Z \u22121 \u0393(M) with M = exp(\u2212\u03b2H) and N = [1 + exp(\u03b2H)]\u22121 .\nIn the limit \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e, P describes the Fermi sea, whence N is the projection onto the occupied\none-particle states.\nThe above derivation would be rigorous if the one-particle Hilbert space were finite dimensional. The question we want to address here is what is the correct replacement for D(\u03bb)\nwhen P describes infinitely many particles, both because the lead may be infinitely extended\nspatially (as appropriate for an open system) and because the Fermi sea may be very or even\ninfinitely deep. The first concern appears to affect only the derivation, but not the result,\neq. (3). However, by the second, D(\u03bb) differs from the identity by more than a trace class\noperator, as would be required by the definition of a Fredholm determinant. A manifestation\nthereof (and in a sense the only one) is that the expected charge transport\nhni = \u2212i\u03c7\u2032 (0) = \u2212i\n\nd\ndet D(\u03bb)\nd\u03bb\n\n\u03bb=0\n\n= tr ((QU \u2212 Q)N)\n\n(4)\n\ninvolves an operator which is not trace class in the stated situation. These statements are\nillustrated (in the \u03b2 = \u221e case) in Fig. 1 representing the phase space of a single particle\nmoving freely.\nThe Fermi sea N corresponds to |p| < pF , pF being the Fermi momentum, and similarly\nthe right half of the lead Q to x > 0. The free evolution, which we take as a simple example\nfor U, is a horizontal shear, so that QU \u2212 Q is associated with two sectors, labelled + and\n\u2212. Their intersection with the horizontal strip associated with N delineates the phase space\nsupport of (QU \u2212 Q)N.

If the dispersion relation is conveniently\nlinearized at \u00b1pF , the depth becomes infinite, implying that the operator is not trace class.\nAs a remedy, we note that the expression\ntr (QN \u2212 QU NU ) = 0 ,\nwith NU = U \u2217 NU, vanishes by splitting the trace, though only suggestively so, because the\ntraces fail to exist separately due to the infinite spatial extent of the leads. Adding nevertheless\nthat expression to (4) yields\nhni = tr (QU (N \u2212 NU )) ,\n(5)\n\nwhich vanishes in the special case of the free evolution, NU = N, and is expected to be finite\nin others. This way of renormalizing the expression is actually declaring that the Fermi sea\ndoes not contribute to the current, instead of relying on a compensation between left and\nright movers, as indicated by + and \u2212 in the figure.\nThis heuristic manipulation motivates the following regularization of the Levitov-Lesovik\ndeterminant.

As we shall see, a slightly weaker result holds at positive temperature.\nLet us mention a few connections to other works. A related regularization of the LevitovLesovik determinant at zero temperature was used in [15], where the relation of counting\nstatistics to a Riemann-Hilbert problem was studied. Another one, exhibiting the symmetry\n(10), was proposed in [16]. On the more mathematical side, regularizations of determinants\nhave been related to renormalization in [22], though by means of a somewhat different reguPn\u22121\nlarization known as detn (1+A) = det(1+A) exp (tr j=1\n(\u22121)j Aj /j). The role of C*-algebras\nin the theory of open systems was recently been advocated by Jak\u0161i\u0107 and Pillet, see e.g. [9],\nin general, but also to fluctuations in particular. A generating function for fluctuations of\nenergy in bosonic systems has been proposed by [19].\nThe purpose of this work is to show that, under reasonable assumptions, eq. (8) is obtained\nwithout recourse to regularizations, if the second quantization is built upon the Fermi sea\nrather than on the vacuum N = 0.\n\n3\n\nResults\n\nLet H be a separable Hilbert space with the following operators acting on it: An orthogonal\nprojection Q, a unitary U, and a selfadjoint N, with\n0 \u2264 N \u2264 1,\n6\n\n(11)\n\n\fwhose physical interpretations have been described in the previous section. Let N \u2032 = 1 \u2212 N.\nWe denote by Ip , (p \u2265 1) the Schatten trace ideals, i.e. the space of all bounded operators A\non H such that kAkpp := tr|A|p < \u221e.\nThe algebra of canonical anticommutation relations (CAR) over H is the C*-algebra A(H)\ngenerated by 1, and the elements a(f ) and a\u2217 (f ), (f \u2208 H), such that\ni. the map f 7\u2212\u2192 a(f ) is antilinear\nii. a\u2217 (f ) = a(f )\u2217\niii. these elements satisfy the following anticommutation relations\n{a(f ), a\u2217 (g)} = (f, g)1 ,\nall other anticommutators vanishing.\nA (global) gauge transformation is expressed by the automorphism \u03b1\u03bb : a(f ) 7\u2192 a(ei\u03bb f ).\nA state \u03c9 on A(H) is gauge-invariant if \u03c9(\u03b1\u03bb (A)) = \u03c9(A) for all A \u2208 A(H). The operator N\ndefines a gauge-invariant quasi-free state \u03c9N through\n\u03c9N (a\u2217 (fn ) . . . a\u2217 (f1 ) a(g1 ) . . . a(gm )) = \u03b4nm det(gi , Nfj ) ,\n\n(12)\n\nor equivalently by \u03c9N (a\u2217 (f )a(g)) = (g, Nf ) and Wick's lemma. Let (HN , \u03c0N , \u03a9N ) be the\ncyclic representation of \u03c9N :\n\u03c9N (A) = (\u03a9N , \u03c0N (A)\u03a9N ) ,\n\n(A \u2208 A(H)) .\n\n(13)\n\nThe algebra of observables is the (strong) closure of the range of \u03c0N , which is equal to its\ndouble commutant \u03c0N (A(H)) = \u03c0N (A(H))\u2032\u2032 . We also recall that a state is pure if and only if\n\u03c0N (A(H)) is irreducible, i.e. \u03c0N (A(H))\u2032 = {c * 1 | c \u2208 C}, see e.g. [5], Thm. 2.3.19. This is\nequivalent to N being a projection operator.\nThese concepts briefly reviewed, we are now ready to state our main theorem. Its significance is discussed below in a series of remarks. The key result, which is part (v) together\nwith Corollary 2, states that the moment generating function is given by the regularized\ndeterminant, as described in the previous section.\nTheorem 1.

(15) demands that the evolution U preserves N, except for creating excitations within an essentially finite region in space and energy, as can be seen from the phase\nspace picture given in the introduction. This assumption is appropriate for the evolution\ninduced by a compact device operating smoothly during a finite time interval.\nb, Q\nb in (ii) are replacements for the non-existent \u0393(U) and d\u0393(Q)\n2) The operators U\nmentioned in the introduction. Eqs. (16, 17) state that any additional particle in the system\nevolves by U, resp. contributes to the charge as described by Q.\n3) If the state is pure, the pair of equations (15) reduce to the first one with square roots\ndropped, and property (iii) holds trivially, since B(HN ) = \u03c0N (A(H))\u2032\u2032 , the bounded operators\nb is unique up to a phase. Incidentally, condition (19) would be trivial in\non HN . Moreover, U\nthis case.\n8\n\n\fb is an observable, and the same is true for U\nb \u2217Q\nb U,\nb because of\n4) Property (iii) states that Q\nb \u2217 \u03c0N (A(H))U\nb \u2282 \u03c0N (A(H)), see (16). Thus, the total charges before and after the evolution\nU\nare separately bestowed with physical meaning.\n5) The physical origin of the extra assumption (19) needed in the mixed state case is as\nfollows. In both cases, the expected charge contained in a portion of the lead is of order of\nits length L, or zero if renormalized by subtraction of a background charge. In the pure case\nhowever, the Fermi sea is an eigenvector of the charge operator, while for the mixed state, the\nvariance of the charge must itself be of order L, because the occupation of the one-particle\nstates is fluctuating, since NN \u2032 6= 0. Hence, in this latter situation, the measurement of\nthe renormalized charge yields finite values only as long as L is finite, of which eq. (19) is a\nmathematical abstraction. This condition, while unnecessary for property (ii), is essential for\n(iii). Without the latter, the l.h.s. of eq. (18) appears to be ambiguous. On the other hand,\nthe weaker condition\n\u221a\n(QU \u2212 Q) NN \u2032 \u2208 I1 ,\n(20)\nis sufficient for property (i) and to ensure that the difference Q\\\nU \u2212 Q is an observable.\n6) The theorem does not apply to the general case (11). The two cases considered suffice\nfor thermal states with \u03b2 = \u221e and 0 < \u03b2 < \u221e.\n\nR\nb = n dP (n) be the spectral representation of Q.\nb According to quantum mechanical\nLet Q\nb with outcome n in dn collapses \u03a9N to the state dP (n)\u03a9N ,\nprinciples an ideal measurement of Q\nnormalized to the probability (dP (n)\u03a9N , dP (n)\u03a9N ) of that outcome. Effectively, this means\nthat dP (n)\u03a9N is the state relevant for a second measurement. The charge transfer is inferred\nb one before and one after the evolution of the sysfrom two measurements [15] of the charge Q,\nb .

Thereafter we prove parts (ii-iv) readily\nif the state is pure, and using its purification, if it is mixed. Finally, the main formula (v)\nis obtained using an approximation procedure in terms of inner automorphisms and finite\ndimensional determinants.\n\n4.1\n\nProof of Corollary 2\n\nWe begin by recalling that every gauge-invariant state is a factor state (see [17], Thm. 5.1),\ni.e.\n\u03c0N (A(H))\u2032 \u2229 \u03c0N (A(H))\u2032\u2032 = {c * 1| c \u2208 C} .\n(21)\nb\n\nb\n\nFrom eq.

Thus e2\u03c0iQ = c, (|c| = 1) and we may assume c = 1 by adding an additive\nb see (iv).

Indeed, for A = \u03c0N (a\u2217 (f ) a(g)), we have ei\u03bbQ Ae\u2212i\u03bbQ = \u03c0N (a\u2217 (ei\u03bbQ f )\na(ei\u03bbQ g)) by (17). The expectations (23) agree because of (ei\u03bbQ g, Nei\u03bbQ f ) = (g, Nf ) by\n[Q, N] = 0. The same holds true by (12) for arbitrary products of a\u2217 (fi ), a(gi ), and by\nb\ndensity, for A \u2208 \u03c0N (A(H))\u2032\u2032 . By (iii) we may apply (23) to Aei\u03bbQ instead of A, and obtain (\u03a9N , Pn A \u03a9N ) = (\u03a9N , APn \u03a9N ); then this to APn \u2208 \u03c0N (A(H))\u2032\u2032 instead of A, and\nb \u2217 ei\u03bbQb U\nb \u2208 U\nb \u2217 \u03c0N (A(H))\u2032\u2032U\nb \u2282\nget (\u03a9N , APn \u03a9N ) = (\u03a9N , Pn APn \u03a9N ).

Following [2] we define them instead as elements of the CAR-algebra\nA(H), when A is of finite rank.\n\u2022 For rank one operators Ai = |fi ihgi |, (i = 1, . . . , n), we set\n\nd\u0393(A1 , . . . , An ) = a\u2217 (fn ) * * * a\u2217 (f1 ) a(g1 ) * * * a(gn ) .\n\n(25)\n\nThe definition is extended by multilinearity to operators Ai of finite rank. The result is\nindependent of the particular decomposition into rank one operators.\n\u2022 For U \u2212 1 of finite rank, we set\n\n\u221e\nX\n1\n\u0393(U) =\nd\u0393(U \u2212 1, . . . , U \u2212 1) ,\n{z\n}\n|\nn!\nn=0\nn\n\nwhere the term n = 0, in which no arguments are present, is read as d\u0393 = 1. The sum\nis finite, because the terms with k > rank(U \u2212 1) vanish.\nThe elements of A(H) just defined share the properties of the operators on Fock space known\nby the same notation.\nLemma 3. Let U \u2212 1 be of finite rank. Then\n\n\u0393(U)a\u2217 (f ) = a\u2217 (Uf )\u0393(U) ,\n\u0393(U1 U2 ) = \u0393(U1 )\u0393(U2 ) .\n\nIn particular, \u0393(U) is unitary if U is.\n12\n\n(26)\n(27)\n\n\fProof.

Their proofs can be found e.g. in\n[1], where however CAR-algebras are introduced in the self-dual guise. A remark at the end\nof this subsection is intended as an aid to translation. The first result is the Shale-Stinespring\ncriterion [24] about unitary implementability (see e.g. [14], [1] Thm. 6.3 (1)).\nProposition 5. Let P be a projection and V a unitary operator on H. The Bogoliubov\nautomorphism induced by V on H, i.e. a(f ) 7\u2192 a(V f ), is unitarily implementable in the\nrepresentation \u03c0P if and only if P V (1 \u2212 P ) and (1 \u2212 P )V P are in the Hilbert-Schmidt class,\nI2 .\nIn particular, an equivalent condition is [P, V ] = P V (1 \u2212 P ) \u2212 (1 \u2212 P )V P \u2208 I2 . There is\na version of this proposition for groups ([1], Thm. 6.10 (2, 3)).\nProposition 6. Let V in the previous proposition be replaced by a 1-parameter unitary group\nV\u03bb , (\u03bb \u2208 R), such that V\u03bb is norm continuous and P V\u03bb (1 \u2212 P ) is continuous in the I2 -norm.\nThen V\u03bb has an implementer of the form Vb\u03bb = exp(i\u03bbb\nv ), where b\nv is a self-adjoint operator on\nHP . The requirement\n(\u03a9P , vb\u03a9P ) = 0\n(31)\n\nmay be imposed, in which case b\nv is unique.\n\nAn equivalent condition, is V\u03bb = exp(i\u03bbv) with v a bounded, selfadjoint operator on H,\nand P v(1 \u2212 P ) \u2208 I2 .\nThe next result is about the continuity of the implementation, see [1], Thm. 6.10 (7).\nProposition 7. Let v and vn , (n = 0, 1, . . .), satisfy the hypotheses of Prop. 6, and let vb, vbn\nsatisfy the normalization (31). If (vn ) converge strongly to v and if kP (vn \u2212 v)(1 \u2212 P )k2 \u2192 0\nas n \u2192 \u221e, then\nvn\ns\u2212 lim ei\u03bbc\n= ei\u03bbbv .\nn\n\nThe last preliminary is concerned with the twisted duality of CAR-algebras. Let P be an\northogonal projection on H, K \u2282 H a closed subspace, and K\u22a5 its orthogonal complement.\ne \u22a5 ) be the von Neumann algebra generated by \u039b\u03c0\nb P (a(f )), (f \u2208 K\u22a5 ), where \u039b\nb is the\nLet A(K\nparity.

Then\n\u039b\u03a9\nb = 0,\n[Vb , \u039b]\n(33)\n\nsee [1], Thm. 6.3 (3), Thm. 6.7 (2). We will actually apply this fact only to Vb = Vb\u03bb as in\nb Vb\u03bb\nProp. 6, in which case it can be verified as follows. Since [V\u03bb , \u22121] = 0, the operators \u039b\nb implement the same Bogoliubov automorphism, whence \u039b\nb Vb\u03bb = c\u03bb Vb\u03bb \u039b\nb with |c\u03bb | = 1.\nand Vb\u03bb \u039b\nb P,\u039b\nb Vb\u03bb \u03a9P ) = c\u03bb (\u03a9P , Vb\u03bb \u03a9P ) we find c\u03bb = 1 for small \u03bb, because\nFrom (\u03a9P , Vb\u03bb \u03a9P ) = (\u039b\u03a9\n(\u03a9P , Vb\u03bb\u03a9P ) \u2192 1, (\u03bb \u2192 0). The conclusion extends to all \u03bb by the group property.\nRemark. In order to make contact with the repeatedly cited article [1] we recall that a selfe \u0393) is given in terms of a separable Hilbert space H\ne equipped with a\ndual CAR-algebra A(H,\ne and the relations are B(h)\u2217 = B(\u0393h)\nconjugation \u0393. Its generators B(h) are linear in h \u2208 H\ne satisfying Pe + \u0393Pe\u0393 = 1 defines a pure\nand {B(h), B(h\u2032 )\u2217 } = (h\u2032 , h)1. A projection Pe on H\nstate \u03c9 on the algebra through\n\u03c9(B(h)\u2217 B(h)) = 0 ,\n\n(Peh = 0) .\n\nThe algebra A(H) is connected to the above by picking a conjugation C on H and by setting\ne = H\u2295H,\nH\n\n\u0393(f \u2295 g) = Cg \u2295 Cf ,\n\nB(f \u2295 g) = a\u2217 (f ) + a(Cg) .\n\nStates defined by P and Pe then agree if Pe(f \u2295 g) = (1 \u2212 P )f \u2295 CP Cg.\n\n4.4\n\nParts (ii-iv)\n\nPure state: N = N 2\nExistence: In the case V\u03bb = exp(i\u03bbQ) we have [N, V\u03bb ] = 0 by eq. (14), so that existence\nb is trivial by Prop. 6. Similarly, in the case V = U\nof a unitary implementer Vb\u03bb = exp(i\u03bbQ)\nwe have [N, U] = (N \u2212 NU \u2217 )U \u2208 I2 by eq. (24). Hence it is also implementable by Prop. 5.\nb or U.\nb Suppose Vb1 and Vb2 both implement\nUniqueness: Let Vb denote either of exp(i\u03bbQ)\nthe same transformation. Then Vb1 Vb2\u2217 \u03c0N (a(V f )) = \u03c0N (a(V f ))Vb1 Vb2\u2217 . Thus Vb1 = (Vb1 Vb2\u2217 )Vb2 and\nVb2 differ by left multiplication with Vb1 Vb2\u2217 \u2208 \u03c0N (A(H))\u2032 . In the pure case the cyclic represenb is unique up to a phase and Q\nb up to an additive constant. As\ntation is irreducible, whence U\nmentioned in Remark 3, property (iii) is empty in this case.\n16\n\n\fMixed state: 0 < N < 1\nGiven 0 \u2264 N \u2264 1 on H, we consider its purification\n\u221a\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2032\nN\nNN\nPN = \u221a\n= PN2\nNN \u2032\nN\u2032\non H \u2295 H, together with the cyclic (or GNS) representation (HPN , \u03c0PN , \u03a9PN ) of the state\ndefined by PN on A(H \u2295 H).

We can not handle the most general mixed case 0 \u2264 N \u2264 1. The reason\ncomes from the following lemma, whose proof is postponed till the end of the section.\nLemma 8. Assume 0 < N < 1 (strict inequality). Then \u03a9PN is cyclic in HPN for \u03c0PN (A(H\u2295\n0)). In particular, we have equality in (34), HN = HPN .\nA unitary V on H induces two automorphisms on A(H \u2295 H): (a) a(f \u2295 g) 7\u2192 a(V f \u2295 g),\nand (b) a(f \u2295 g) 7\u2192 a(V f \u2295 V g), whose implementation may be envisaged:\n(a)\n(b)\n\nVb \u03c0PN (a(f \u2295 g))Vb \u2217 =\u03c0PN (a(V f \u2295 g)) ,\nVb \u03c0PN (a(f \u2295 g))Vb \u2217 =\u03c0PN (a(V f \u2295 V g)) .\n\n(36)\n\nBoth choices for Vb would provide an implementation for V in the representation \u03c0N on\nHN . Only in the first case we have Vb \u2208 \u03c0N (A(H))\u2032\u2032. Indeed, by (32) applied to H \u2295 0 \u2282\ne \u2295 H)\u2032 . This however follows from\nH \u2295 H instead of K \u2282 H, we need to check Vb \u2208 A(0\nb = 0, see (33).\n[Vb , \u03c0PN (a(0 \u2295 g))] = 0, see (36), and from [Vb , \u039b]\nIn order to determine the existence of these implementations we compute\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u0013\u0015 \u0012\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2032U \u2212U\n[N,\nU\n]\nU1 0\nNN\nNN \u2032\n1\n2\n1\n\u221a\n\u221a\n=\nPN ,\n,\n0 U2\nNN \u2032 U1 \u2212 U2 NN \u2032\n[N \u2032 , U2 ]\n17\n\n\fand see that that of (a) (i.e. U1 = V and U2 = 1) is granted if\n\u221a\n[N, V ] \u2208 I2 ,\n(1 \u2212 V ) NN \u2032 \u2208 I2 ;\n\n(37)\n\nand that of (b) (U1 = V = U2 ) if\n[N, V ] \u2208 I2 ,\n\n\u221a\n[ NN \u2032 , V ] \u2208 I2 .\n\n(38)\n\nWe can now complete the proof of parts (ii) and (iii) of the theorem.\nFor V = exp(i\u03bbQ),\n\u221a\n\u221a\ni\u03bbQ\n\u2032\nwe use (a). Then eqs. (37) hold true by eqs. (14, 19): (1 \u2212 e ) NN = (1 \u2212 ei\u03bb )Q NN \u2032 .\nThis also proves (iii). For V = U, we use (b), with conditions (38) holding by eq. (15, 24).\nPart (iv) is readily proven as follows. Like in the pure case, the implementers are unique\nup to left multiplication by an element of \u03c0N (A(H))\u2032 (which is larger than the multiples of\nb \u2208 \u03c0N (A(H))\u2032\u2032 still implies\nthe identity since the representation is reducible). Thus exp (i\u03bbQ)\nits uniqueness up to a phase because of (21).\n\u0003\nRemark. If it were for property (ii) only, one could adopt method (b) also for V = exp(i\u03bbQ).\nProof of Lemma 8. The space HPN is spanned by the vectors\nn\nY\ni=1\n\n\u03c0PN (a# (fi \u2295 gi ))\u03a9PN .\n\n(39)\n\nIt suffices to show that they can be approximated arbitrarily well by a sum of such vectors\nwhere, however, gi = 0. To this end, we first note that\n\u03c0PN (a\u2217 (PN (f \u2295 g)))\u03a9PN = 0 ,\n\n\u03c0PN (a(PN\u2032 (f \u2295 g)))\u03a9PN = 0 ,\n\nwhere PN\u2032 = 1 \u2212 PN . This follows from (12) for PN instead of N, and implies in turn\nk\u03c0PN (a\u2217 (f \u2295 g))\u03a9PN k \u2264 kPN\u2032 (f \u2295 g)k ,\n\nk\u03c0PN (a(f \u2295 g))\u03a9PN k \u2264 kPN (f \u2295 g)k .\n\nLet us first consider the case where the last factor in (39) is an annihilation operator and set\nfn \u2295 gn =: f \u2295 g.

Thus,\nkPN (f \u2295 g \u2212 fe \u2295 0)k \u2264 kF (N < \u01eb)gk\n\ncan be made arbitrarily small because of Ker N = {0}. If the last factor is a creation operator,\nthe arguments proceed similarly using Ker N \u2032 = {0}. Hence the announced replacement can\nbe performed in the last factor. After anticommuting it to the left, the claim is reduced to\nproducts with fewer factors, for which it holds by induction.\n\u0003\n\n4.5\n\nPart (v)\n\nThe idea of the proof is to approximate the Bogoliubov automorphism induced by ei\u03bbQ by\nmeans of inner automorphisms, as introduced in Subsection 4.3. The generating function on\nthe l.h.s. of (18) then becomes computable by Lemma 4. We present separate proofs in the\npure and the mixed case. The second proof, while applying to both cases, is longer than the\none we give for pure states. Both depend on Prop. 7.\nPure state. Let F be a finite rank operator on H with [F, N] = 0.

Another choice for Fb is fixed by\n(\u03a9N , Fb\u03a9N ) = 0 ,\n\n(41)\n\nb\nand we may ask the same normalization for Q.\n\nLemma 9.

Let us start by proving a result analogous to Lemma 9:\nLemma 10. Let P , Q be orthogonal projections in a separable Hilbert space H with\n[Q, P ] \u2208 I1 .\n\n(47)\n\nThen there are finite dimensional subprojections Fn of Q with\nk[Fn \u2212 Q, P ]k1 \u2212\u2192 0 ,\n\n(n \u2192 \u221e) .\n\n(48)\n\nProof. We split Q as\nQ = QP Q + Q(1 \u2212 P )Q \u2261 L1 + L0 ,\n\n(49)\n\nand observe that [Q, L1 ]=0 and\n(P \u2212 1)L1 \u2208 I1 ,\n\n(50)\n\nL21 \u2212 L1 = QP [Q, P ]Q \u2208 I1 .\nBy the last property, the only possible accumulation points in the spectrum of L1 are 0 and\n1. In particular, there is an x \u2208 (0, 1) which is not in the spectrum. Let Q1 be the spectral\nprojection of L1 associated with (x, \u221e). It may be represented as\nI\n1\nQ1 =\n(z \u2212 L1 )\u22121 dz ,\n2\u03c0i C\nH\nwhere C \u2282 C is a contour encircling that part of the spectrum only. Using C z \u22121 dz = 0, due\nto x > 0, we have\nI\n\u0001\n1\n(P \u2212 1)Q1 =\n(P \u2212 1) (z \u2212 L1 )\u22121 \u2212 z \u22121 dz\n2\u03c0i C\nI\n1\n(P \u2212 1)L1 (z \u2212 L1 )\u22121 z \u22121 dz \u2208 I1\n(51)\n=\n2\u03c0i C\n21\n\n\fby (50). On the subspace Ran Q, the projection Q1 , defined in terms of L1 and x is complementary to the one, Q0 , similarly defined by L0 and 1 \u2212 x, see (49). Since 1 \u2212 x > 0, we\nhave\nP Q0 \u2208 I1\n(52)\n(i)\n\nby analogy to (51). Let now Fn , (i = 0, 1), be a sequence of finite dimensional subprojections\n(i) s\nof Qi with Fn \u2192 Qi . Then\n[Fn(0) \u2212 Q0 , P ] = (Fn(0) \u2212 Q0 )P \u2212 P (Fn(0) \u2212 Q0 ) = (Fn(0) \u2212 Q0 )Q0 P \u2212 P Q0 (Fn(0) \u2212 Q0 ) ,\n\n[Fn(1) \u2212 Q1 , P ] = [Fn(1) \u2212 Q1 , P \u2212 1] = (Fn(1) \u2212 Q1 )Q1 (P \u2212 1) \u2212 (P \u2212 1)Q1 (Fn(1) \u2212 Q1 ) ,\nare trace class by (51, 52), and converge to zero in the corresponding norm by (46) and\n(0)\n(1)\nkT \u2217 k1 = kT k1 . Thus Fn = Fn + Fn is seen to have the stated properties.\n\u0003\ne = Q \u2295 0 instead of H, P and Q; in this case,\nWe apply the lemma to H \u2295 H, PN and Q\ne are of the form F \u2295 0, with F a subprojection of Q. Since\nsubprojections of Q\n\u221a\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2032\n[N,\nQ]\n\u2212Q\nNN\ne = \u221a\n[PN , Q]\nNN \u2032 Q\n0\n\nthe hypothesis (47) of Lemma 10 is fulfilled. The claim yields\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nk[Fn \u2212 Q, N]k1 \u2212\u2192 0 ,\n\n(53)\n\n\u221a\nas well as k NN \u2032 (Fn \u2212Q)k1 \u2192 0, which however is already known by (19) and Fn = Fn Q. We\nthus have a sequence (Fn ) of unitarily implementable transformations: the conditions (37) are\nboth fulfilled, the first one\u221abecause [N, exp(\u2212i\u03bbFn )] = \u221a\n[N, Fn ](exp(\u2212i\u03bb) \u2212 1) and the second\n\u2032\nbecause (1 \u2212 exp(\u2212i\u03bbFn )) NN = (exp(\u2212i\u03bb) \u2212 1)Fn Q NN \u2032 . Moreover, the assumptions of\nProp. 7 are satisfied, so that eqs. (43,40) are true again.\nTo complete the proof, it remains to show that\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\ndet(N \u2032 + ei\u03bbFnU e\u2212i\u03bbFn N) \u2212\u2192 det(e\u2212i\u03bbNU QU N \u2032 ei\u03bbN Q + ei\u03bbNU QU Ne\u2212i\u03bbN Q ) .\n\n(54)\n\nTo this end, we multiply the determinant by\ndet(1 + FnU (e\u2212i\u03bbNU \u2212 1)) ,\n\n22\n\ndet(1 + (ei\u03bbN \u2212 1)Fn ) ,\n\n(55)\n\n\ffrom the left, resp. from the right. These factors would be identical to those in (44) if Fn and\nN commuted, which is however no longer the case. Also, their product is not 1, but rather\nequals\ndet(1 + FnU (e\u2212i\u03bbNU \u2212 1)) * det(1 + (ei\u03bbN \u2212 1)Fn )\n\n= det(1 + (ei\u03bbN \u2212 1)Fn ) * det(1 + Fn (e\u2212i\u03bbN \u2212 1))\n\n= det(1 \u2212 Fn + ei\u03bbN Fn e\u2212i\u03bbN ) ,\nwhere\ni\u03bbN\n\ne\n\n\u2212i\u03bbN\n\nFn e\n\n\u2212 Fn = i\n\nand\n\nZ\n\n(56)\n\n\u03bb\n\n0\n\neisN [N, Fn ]e\u2212isN ds \u2208 I1\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nkei\u03bbN Fn e\u2212i\u03bbN \u2212 Fn k1 \u2212\u2192 0\n\n(57)\n\n(1 + FnU (e\u2212i\u03bbNU \u2212 1))(N \u2032 + ei\u03bbFnU e\u2212i\u03bbFn N)(1 + (ei\u03bbN \u2212 1)Fn ) .\n\n(58)\n\nk(1 + FnU (e\u2212i\u03bbNU \u2212 1))N \u2032 \u2212 e\u2212i\u03bbNU QU N \u2032 k1 \u2212\u2192 0 ,\n\n(59)\n\nby [N, Q] = 0 and (53). Therefore, (56) converges to 1 and it suffices to prove (54) with the\nl.h.s. multiplied by (55). The determinant becomes that of\n\nBy means of\n\u2212i\u03bbFn\n\nke\n\ni\u03bbFn\n\nNe\n\n\u2212 Nk1 \u2212\u2192 0 ,\n\n(60)\n\nwhich we shall prove momentarily, we may replace (58) by\ne\u2212i\u03bbNU QU N \u2032 (1 + (ei\u03bbN \u2212 1)Fn ) + (1 + FnU (e\u2212i\u03bbNU \u2212 1))ei\u03bbFnU Ne\u2212i\u03bbFn (1 + (ei\u03bbN \u2212 1)Fn ) .\nThe claim then follows from\nkN \u2032 (1 + (ei\u03bbN \u2212 1)Fn ) \u2212 N \u2032 ei\u03bbN Q k1 \u2212\u2192 0 ,\n\u2212i\u03bbFn\n\nkNe\n\ni\u03bbN\n\n(1 + (e\n\n\u2212i\u03bbN \u2032 Q\n\n\u2212 1)Fn ) \u2212 Ne\n\nk1 \u2212\u2192 0 ,\n\n\u2032 Q\ni\u03bbNU\nU\n\nk(1 + FnU (e\u2212i\u03bbNU \u2212 1))ei\u03bbFnU N \u2212 e\n\nNk1 \u2212\u2192 0 ,\n\n(61)\n(62)\n(63)\n\nIt remains to prove (59 - 63). The limit (60) follows like (57). The expression in (61) is\nN \u2032 (exp(i\u03bbN) \u2212 1)(Fn \u2212 Q) = f (N) NN \u2032 Q(Fn \u2212 Q) where f (N) = N \u22121 (exp(i\u03bbN) \u2212 1) is a\nbounded operator; its convergence to zero follows from (19). As for (62) we have\ne\u2212i\u03bbFn (1 + (ei\u03bbN \u2212 1)Fn ) = (1 + (e\u2212i\u03bb \u2212 1)Fn )(1 + (ei\u03bbN \u2212 1)Fn )\n\n= 1 + (e\u2212i\u03bb ei\u03bbN \u2212 1)Fn + (e\u2212i\u03bb \u2212 1)[Fn , ei\u03bbN ]Fn ,\n23\n\n\fso that by using (57) it remains to show\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nkN(1 + (e\u2212i\u03bbN \u2212 1)Fn ) \u2212 Ne\u2212i\u03bbN Q k1 \u2212\u2192 0 .\nThis, however, is just (61) with N and N \u2032 interchanged. Finally, in (59, 63) we may, by (15),\nreplace N and N \u2032 by NU and NU\u2032 in those places where the subscript is not already present.\nBy passing to a unitary conjugate and adjoint, they reduce to (61, 62).\n\u0003\n\n5\n\nExamples\n\nWe illustrate the hypotheses (14, 15) by presenting a model in which they can be verified.\nThe left and right portions of the single lead mentioned in Sect. 1 are replaced by two infinite\nleads, which are however chiral. The interaction between them occurs in a finite interval and\nallows particles to scatter between the leads.\n\nFigure 2: A simple model with two infinite chiral leads\nLet H = L2 (R) \u2295 L2 (R) be the one-particle space with operators\nQ=\n\n\u0012\n\n1 0\n0 0\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\nN=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0398(\u2212p)\n0\n0\n\u0398(p)\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(64)\n\nHere, x \u2208 R is the position variable, p = \u2212id/dx the conjugate momentum, and \u0398 the\nHeaviside function. The projection N describes the Fermi sea of the free Hamiltonian\n\u0013\n\u0012\np 0\n(65)\nH0 =\n0 \u2212p\nfor vanishing Fermi energy. Clearly, [Q, N] = 0.\n\n24\n\n\f5.1\n\nExample 1\n\nThe example is conveniently stated by passing to another pair of conjugate variables, E and\nt: The energy E := \u00b1p yields the spectral representation of H0 in multiplication form,\n\u0013\n\u0012\nE 0\n,\nH0 =\n0 E\nwhile the operator\nT =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2212x 0\n0 x\n\n\u0013\n\n=:\n\n\u0012\n\nt 0\n0 t\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\nrepresents, due to i[H0 , T ] = \u22121, the time t of passage at x = 0 of a freely moving particle,\nwhich is presently elsewhere. In this example only, the meaning of t is therefore that of a\ndynamical variable, and not that of the parameter governing evolution.\nRather than specifying an interacting Hamiltonian, we model the scattering process by\ndirectly giving the propagator U for the time interval under consideration. We assume it to\nbe given by a unitary multiplication operator U(t) with U(t) \u2212 1 of compact support, see\nRemark 1 in Sect. 3.\nSuch a simple kind of evolution should be seen as an effective description in the adiabatic\nlimit and in the interaction picture. The passage across the interaction region maps the\nincoming state to the outgoing one by means of a scattering matrix which, in the limit of low\nfrequencies \u03c9, is that of the static scatterer in effect at time t, S(t). In the same limit, only\nelectrons within an interval \u223c ~\u03c9 of the Fermi energy ought to matter for transport. Thus,\nU(t) = S(t, 0), where the 2 \u00d7 2-matrix S(t, E) is the fiber of S(t) at energy E. For a more\nthorough justification, see [6, 3].\nProposition 11. Suppose U \u2212 1 \u2208 M2 (C0\u221e (Rt )). Then [N, U] \u2208 I1 .\nHere M2 (X) are the 2 \u00d7 2 matrices with entries in X.\nProof. We may rename U(t) \u2212 1 by U(t) without loss. By the assumption we may write\nU = f U, where f = f (t) satisfies f \u2208 C0\u221e (Rt ), too. Then [N, U] = f [N, U] + [N, f ]U, with\nf [N, U] = f (E + i)\u22121 * (E + i)[N, U] ,\nand similarly for the second term. We claim that both factors are Hilbert-Schmidt and hence\ntheir product trace class. The first one is, because the functions f and g(E) \u2261 (E + i)\u22121 are\n25\n\n\fin L2 (Rt ), resp. L2 (RE ). As for the second one, we note that N = \u0398(\u2212E) \u2297 12 , whence [N, U]\nhas matrix entries [\u0398(\u2212E), Uij ]. That leads to integral operators K acting merely on L2 (RE )\nwith kernels\n\u0001\nbij (E \u2032 \u2212 E) \u0398(\u2212E) \u2212 \u0398(\u2212E \u2032 ) .\nK(E, E \u2032 ) = (E + i)U\nThey are supported where sgn E = \u2212sgn E \u2032 and satisfy\nZZ\nZ \u221eZ \u221e\n\u0001\n\u2032 2\n\u2032\nbij (E \u2032 + E \u2032\u2032 )|2 + |U\nbij (\u2212E \u2032 \u2212 E \u2032\u2032 )|2 dE dE \u2032\u2032 ,\n|K(E, E )| dE dE =\n|E \u2032\u2032 + i|2 |U\n0\n\n0\n\nwhich is finite. Thus, the corresponding operator is in I2 .\n\n\u0003\n\nBy contrast, but under the same assumption as in the proposition, the operator (QU \u2212Q)N\nmay fail to be trace class. By (4), this shows the need for regularizing (3). Indeed, we may\narrange for a \u03c8 \u2208 H and U such that (QU \u2212 Q)\u03c8 6= 0. The sequence \u03c8n = exp(inT )\u03c8\ns\ntends to zero weakly. Using \u0398(\u2212E) exp(int) = exp(int)\u0398(n \u2212 E) and \u0398(n \u2212 E) \u2192 1, we\nhave kN\u03c8n \u2212 \u03c8n k \u2192 0 and, since Q, U are multiplication operators in t, k(QU \u2212 Q)N\u03c8n k \u2192\nk(QU \u2212Q)\u03c8k =\n6 0. As a result, (QU \u2212Q)N is not even compact. The argument just given may\nbe summarized in physical terms as follows: Whatever contribution to transport, as signified\nby (QU \u2212 Q)N, comes from one energy in the Fermi sea, it is repeated at all such energies,\nbecause the evolution U proceeds with the same velocity \u00b11 at all energies.\nIt should be remarked that [N, U] may fail to be in I2 if, unlike in Prop. 11, U(t) attains\ndifferent limits at t \u2192 \u00b1\u221e. This fact has been pointed out in [12] in slightly different terms as\na manifestation of the orthogonality catastrophe. Consider for instance a potential drop V (t)\nR\u221e\nof finite duration being applied between the leads, with \u2212\u221e V (t)dt \u2208\n/ 2\u03c0Z. That situation\ncan be modeled in the context of the present example by means of a vector potential, where\nit gives raise to the catastrophe. The same physical situation is however tame in the context\nof the next example.\n\n5.2\n\nExample 2\n\nHere we specify a time-dependent perturbation of (65), H(t) = H0 + V (t), where V (t) is\nmultiplication by a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix V (t, x). Let U = U(t2 , t1 ) be the propagator for H(t)\nbetween times t1 and t2 .\nProposition 12. Suppose V (t, *), \u2202t V (t, *) \u2208 M2 (C0\u221e (Rx )). Then [N, U] \u2208 I2 .\n\nNote that the commutator is claimed to be Hilbert-Schmidt only, which covers only the\nstatements (ii-iv) of Theorem 1.\n26\n\n\fProof.

In larger\ndimensions, as considered there, the implementability is ensured only in some cases.\nWe remark that by the method used in Example 1 one can show that diagonal perturbations lead to [N, U] \u2208 I1 , but not for off-diagonal ones.\nAcknowledgements.
