HD 50138 is a southern star that presents the B[e] phenomenon, but its evolutionary stage is still not well known. This object\npresents spectral variability, which can be explained by outbursts or shell phases. Spectropolarimetric observations have shown the\npresence of a non-spherically symmetric circumstellar environment that is responsible for the B[e] phenomenon. However, up to now,\nthe structure of the circumstellar medium of this object has not been studied deeply.\nAims. Based on recent optical long baseline interferometric observations from the VLTI/MIDI and VLTI/AMBER, and also from the\nKeck segment-tilting experiment, we study the structure of the circumstellar environment of HD 50138.\nMethods. The analysis of our data is based on geometrical analytical modeling, also using the recent LITpro software and considering\na large space of parameters, which allows us to obtain a good estimate of the geometry of the circumstellar medium of HD 50138,\nresponsible for the emission in the H, K, and N-bands.\nResults. We resolve the circumstellar environment of HD 50138 and describe its geometry for the first time in detail. Through analysis of multiwavelength data, the presence of a dusty circumstellar disk with an orientation onto the sky-plane of 71 \u00b1 7\u25e6 , which is\nperpendicular to the polarimetric measurements from the literature, was derived. We also derived that HD 50138 is seen under an\nintermediate angle related to the line of sight, 56 \u00b1 4\u25e6 . In addition, the structure of the disk and the flux contributions of the gas and\ndust components is discussed.\nConclusions. Based on analysis of different sets of interferometric data, we describe the circumstellar disk whose geometric parameters were determined, allowing us to understand the geometry of the circumstellar material of this bright star with the B[e]\nphenomenon.\nKey words.

Introduction\nThe B[e] phenomenon in stars with quite different evolutionary\nstages (Lamers et al. 1998) is still a puzzle. Several questions,\nespecially those related to the physical processes responsible for\nthis phenomenon and associated to the role of binarity or even\nof stellar mergers, are still being debated. This happens because\nonly a few objects have been studied deeply up to now and more\nthan 50% of the B[e] stars have badly known or unknown evolutionary stages.\nIn this paper, we continue the study of the southern galactic B[e] star HD 50138 (V743 Mon, MWC158, IRAS 06491\u22c6\nBased on observations made with the ESO Very Large Telescope\nInterferometer at Paranal Observatory (Chile) under the Guarantied\nTime Observing, programs 080.C.0089, 080.D.0181 and 082.D.0047,\nand from the ESO archive.\n\u22c6\u22c6\nThis research made use of the Jean-Marie Mariotti Center LITpro\nservice co-developped by CRAL, LAOG and FIZEAU.\n\n0654), started by Borges Fernandes et al. (2009, hereafter Paper\nI). This star has been studied since the beginning of the last\ncentury (Merrill et al. 1925), and several papers have described\nthe presence of a strong spectral variability. This variability has\nbeen explained by the presence of outbursts and shell phases\n(Hutsem\u00e9kers 1985; Andrillat & Houziaux 1991). Paper I has\nsuggested that a new shell phase took place before 2007, based\non the analysis of high-resolution spectroscopic data. The stellar parameters of this object were also derived, confirming that\nHD 50138 is a B6-7 III-V star.\nDespite numerous papers on the topic, the evolutionary stage\nof HD 50138 remains highly uncertain. It has usually been classified either as a pre main-sequence Herbig Ae/Be object or as\na classical Be star (Paper I and references therein). This star has\nalso been classified as \"a transition object between a classical\nBe and a B[e] star\" (Jaschek et al. 1993) or simply as an unclassified B[e] star (Lamers et al. 1998). In addition, the possibility\nof binarity cannot be discarded (Cidale et al. 2001; Baines et al.\n\n\f2\n\nBorges Fernandes et al.: The galactic unclassified B[e] star HD 50138\n\n2006), similar to what is found by Millour et al. (2009) for the\nunclassified B[e] star HD 87643. A deeper discussion about the\nnature of HD 50138 can be seen in Sect. 4 of Paper I.\nIn Paper I, the color excess of HD 50138 due to purely interstellar extinction, i.e. E(B \u2212 V) = 0.08 mag, was also derived based on the existence of diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs).\nMoreover, from the analysis of the observed color indices, it\nwas noted that the total extinction in the direction of this star\nwas higher than the purely interstellar one. Therefore, this extinction excess must come from the circumstellar environment\nof HD 50138. However, how gas and dust are distributed in the\nclose vicinity of HD 50138 is still unknown.\nMeasurements from polarimetry and spectropolarimetry\nhave shown that the circumstellar material of HD 50138 is not\nspherically distributed. Based on UV and optical spectropolarimetry and on the analysis of H\u03b1 intensity, Bjorkman et al.\n(1998) show that electron scattering in a geometrically thin disk\nseen almost edge-on would be the main mechanism to produce\nthe intrinsic polarization detected. On the other hand, Bjorkman\net al. (1998) also suggest that the dust responsible for the strong\nIR excess of HD 50138 (Allen 1973) would be either distributed\nin an optically thin spherical envelope or formed by large grains\n(\u2265 1\u03bcm), not contributing to the intrinsic polarization measured.\nPaper I showed that an ionized circumstellar disk or a dusty optically thin envelope, composed mainly of small grains, could be\nresponsible for the circumstellar extinction. However other scenarios, like a dusty disk, where the dust is not located in the line\nof sight, could not be discarded.\nBjorkman et al. (1998) find a polarization angle of 158\u25e6 ,\nwhich is quite similar to the mean value of 160\u00b12.6\u25e6 found by\nYudin & Evans (1998) from UBV polarimetric measurements\nand of 157.5\u00b15.0\u25e6 by Oudmaijer & Drew (1999) from spectropolarimetric observations across the H\u03b1 region. In addition,\nOudmaijer & Drew (1999) also suggest there are two different\nkinematic regions, where H\u03b1 would be formed: a rotating disk\nand also a more spatially extended component. Assuming a disk\ngeometry, this polarization angle can be perpendicular or parallel\nto the major axis of the disk, depending on whether the circumstellar material is optically thin or optically thick, respectively\n(Angel 1969; Brown & McLean 1977).\nRecently, the advent of the optical long baseline interferometry using large telescopes, especially the VLT 8-m and the\nKeck 10-m telescopes, has made it possible to resolve, and\nconsequently describe, the gaseous and dusty circumstellar environment of the brightest stars with the B[e] phenomenon\n(Domiciano de Souza et al. 2007; Monnier et al. 2009; Millour\net al. 2009; Meilland et al. 2010). The high spatial resolution\nacquired, associated to the spectral dispersion provided by instruments like VLTI/MIDI and VLTI/AMBER makes it possible\nto obtain sizes, shapes, and orientations of the circumstellar material, as a function of wavelength in the near and mid-IR ranges.\nIn this paper, our study is therefore focused on the description of the structure of the circumstellar material of HD 50138 by\nthe analysis of recent interferometric data from VLTI/MIDI and\nVLTI/AMBER, and also from Keck segment-tilting experiment.\nThe paper has the following structure. In Sect. 2 we present\nthe observations and the data reduction processes. In Sect. 3, we\npresent the reduced data and our analysis that considers geometrical models. In Sect. 4, we present the discussion of our results\nand in Sect. 5, a short conclusion.\n\n2. Observations and data reduction\nWe obtained interferometric data on HD 50138 using the VLTI\nMID-infrared Interferometric instrument (VLTI/MIDI, Leinert\net al. 2004). The observations were carried out between\nDecember 2007 and March 2009 (guarantied time observing) using the 1.8-m auxiliary telescopes (ATs). The data were taken\nusing the HIGH-SENS mode, where the photometry and the\nfringes are not recorded simultaneously. In total, 14 visibility measurements were obtained considering different projected\nbaselines and orientations onto the sky-plane, as described in\nthe Table 1. Sirius and Aldebaran were used as calibrators in\nthese observing runs and their angular diameters come from\nMIDI Calibrator Catalogue1. The (u,v) plane coverage of the\nVLTI/MIDI data of HD 50138 is seen in Fig. 1 (left panel).\nThe data reduction was performed using two different packages: MIDI Interactive Analysis (MIA, Leinert et al. 2004) and\nExpert Work-Station (EWS, Jaffe 2004), version 1.5.1. Since\nthe two packages provide similar results within the error bars,\nwe decided to use the EWS reduced visibilities in this work.\nVLTI/MIDI allows us to obtain not only spectrally dispersed\nfringes, but also the low-resolution spectrum (R = 30) of the\nsource in the N-band region (7.5-13 \u03bcm). A comparison between VLTI/MIDI spectrum and IRAS low-resolution spectrum\nof HD 50138 is shown in Fig. 2.\nIn addition to our VLTI/MIDI data, we also used 92 N-band\n(at 10.7 \u03bcm) visibility measurements obtained from the Keck\nsegment-tilting experiment2. It used 36 segments of 1.8-m each\nfrom the 10-m Keck telescope, forming four interferometric arrays, five subarrays, and baselines from 0.5-m to 9.0-m, by the\ntilting of the segments in the primary mirror (for more details,\nsee Monnier et al. 2009). The indication of the region covered\nby Keck data in the (u,v) plane can be seen in the Fig. 1 (left\npanel).\nWe also analyzed sets of data at low spectral resolution\n(LR, i.e. R = 35) from five different observing nights in\nDecember 2007 and January 2008 from the Astronomical Multi\nBEam Recombiner, the near-infrared instrument of the VLTI\n(VLTI/AMBER, Petrov et al. 2003). We obtained data for two\nof these nights, and for the other three the data were taken from\nthe ESO archive. A total of nine triplets, consequently measurements from 27 baselines, were available. However, based on the\nselection of the best quality data, we used only measurements\nfrom 17 baselines3 (Table 1). The (u,v) plane coverage of the\nVLTI/AMBER data of HD 50138 is presented in the Fig. 1 (right\npanel). Measurements related to closure phases cannot be analyzed due to the large error bars presented (about 50\u25e6 ). The calibration stars were HD 52938, HD52436, HD96538, HD34137,\nHD44621, HD54810, and HD96068 (see Table 1), and their angular diameters come from Merand et al. (2005). The data reduction was performed with the standard VLTI/AMBER data reduction software (amdlib version 2.1, Millour et al. 2004; Tatulli\net al. 2007) and the frame selection was done as described by\nCruzal\u00e8bes et al. (2007).\n\n3.

N-band data (Keck+VLTI/MIDI)\n3.1.1. The circumstellar environment at 10.7\u03bcm\n\nMonnier et al. (2009) obtained data at 10.7 \u03bcm with the Keck\nsegment-tilting experiment by considering different orientations\nand baseline lengths from 0.5 to 9.0 m, making it possible to\nobtain information about the large-scale circumstellar environment. They could model these data by assuming both (i) a 1-D\nGaussian disk (actually a round 2-D geometry) with a full width\nhalf maximum (FWHM) of 58\u00b16 mas, associated with an extended circumstellar envelope (called \"halo\" by them) on scales\nlarger than 0.5\u2032\u2032 , which would be responsible for only 1% of\nthe total flux in the N-band; and (ii) a 2-D Gaussian disk with\nFWHM for the major and minor axes of 66\u00b14 and 46\u00b19 mas, respectively, also in association with a \"halo\" responsible for just\n1% of the total flux in the N-band. The orientation of the major axis of the 2-D Gaussian disk was derived as 63\u00b16\u25e6, which is\nroughly perpendicular to measurements of the polarization angle\ncited in the Sect. 1.\n\nThus, we have analyzed VLTI/MIDI data that have a broader\nspread of baselines in terms of lengths and orientations (Table\n1), allowing us to constrain both the radial profile of the object\nand its flattening. These data can be divided into two groups in\nterms of baseline orientations (Table 2): from B1 to B6 , which\nare roughly parallel to the polarization angle, and from B7 to\nB14 , which are roughly perpendicular to it. The parallel baselines show an environment that is less resolved than seen by the\nperpendicular ones. This is shown in Table 2 from the estimate of\nthe object extension (FWHM) assuming a simple 1-D Gaussian\ndisk model. This result agrees with the orientation of the major\naxis of the disk found by Monnier et al. (2009).\nHowever, from our two groups of baselines, we derived a\nmean value for the FWHM of the major and minor axes at 10.7\n\u03bcm of 52\u00b115 and 24\u00b12 mas, respectively. The large difference\ncompared to the results of Monnier et al. (2009), i.e., a factor of\n1.3 for the major and 1.9 for the minor axis, shows the limitation\nof their calculations owing to the absence of longer baselines.\nIn Fig. 3, we have plotted the VLTI/MIDI and Keck visibilities\nas a function of the spatial frequency, and we note that different\nsingle Gaussian disks with FWHM from 20 to 100 mas cannot\nmodel them. Since the trend in the visibilities is not compatible\nwith other simple models, such as uniform disk or ring, we need\nto find a geometric analytical model that simultaneously fits the\nlow spatial frequencies probed by the Keck and the higher ones\nmeasured by the VLTI/MIDI. We test two different models that\nare compatible with this qualitative analysis:\n1. A model consisting of two elliptical Gaussian distributions\n(representing a compact and a larger component) with the\nsame flattening and orientation of the major axis (\u03b8). The\nother parameters are the FWHM of the major axis of each\nGaussian and the relative flux of the compact component F1\n(i.e., FWHM of the second Gaussian, F2 = 1 - F1 ). Thus,\nthis model has five free parameters.\n2. A flattened exponential distribution, i.e. I(r) \u221d e\u2212|r/r0 | . The\nmodel parameters are the flattening, the orientation of the\nmajor axis (\u03b8), and r0 . To enable direct comparison with the\nGaussian distribution, we use the FWHM of the exponential distribution instead of r0 . A simple calculation using the\nformula I(FWHM/2) = 0.5, directly gives FWHM = 1.38 r0 .\nThis model only has three free parameters.\n\n\fBorges Fernandes et al.: The galactic unclassified B[e] star HD 50138\n\nFinally, we also use a single elliptical Gaussian distribution\nas a reference model. To not be biased by a putative change in the\nenvelope geometry between 8\u03bcm and 13\u03bcm, we decided to first\nfocus on the visibilities at 10.7\u03bcm. Using the VLTI/MIDI and\nKeck data, we have a set of 106 measurements. The model fitting\nis done by minimizing the reduced chi-square (\u03c72r ) on the visibilities, using a Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) two-dimensional algorithm. As this technique allows converging to local minimum,\nwe use 104 starting random positions in the parameter space to\nbe sure that we reach the global minimum. The result of this\nmodel fitting is presented in Table 3.\nAs already noticed in Fig. 3, a single elliptical Gaussian distribution is not able to fit our dataset correctly, since its \u03c72r is significantly higher than for the other two models. The 2-Gaussian\nmodel slightly shows the best \u03c72r , but the characteristic sizes,\nbased on the FWHM of the major axis of the exponential distribution and of the compact component of the 2-Gaussian distributions, are compatible within 3\u03c3, i.e., 30.7\u00b11.4 and 35.2\u00b11.5\nmas, respectively. Moreover, the flattening and orientation of\nthe major-axes are consistent within 1\u03c3. In addition, we could\nalso estimate the inclination related to the line of sight of the\ncircumstellar structure, based on the flattening and assuming\nthe 2-Gaussian and exponential distributions, i.e., 56.7\u00b10.4\u25e6 and\n59.0\u00b11.6\u25e6 respectively, which are also compatible within 2\u03c3.\nTable 3.

Wavelength dependence through the N-Band\n\nThe VLTI/MIDI data show an object that is partly resolved for\nall baselines with a slight increase in visibilities with the wavelength. This mainly stems from the wavelength dependence of\nthe interferometer spatial resolution, i.e. \u03c6min \u221d \u03bb/B, which is\na factor 1.6 higher at 8\u03bcm than at 13\u03bcm, explaining the observed increase in visibility with the wavelength. No indication\nof a more extended envelope in the silicate band region is seen,\nunlike what is expected, since the opacity is supposed to be significantly higher in this band than in the continuum. However,\nas shown in Fig. 2, the silicate band is strongly in emission and\nis very broad, covering almost all the 8-13\u03bcm VLTI/MIDI spectral band. This could explain why no clear drop is seen in the\nvisibilities at the center of the silicate band.\nTo quantitatively constrain the geometry of the circumstellar environment through the N-band, we used the same fitting\nmethod described in the previous section, considering only the\n2-Gaussian model, which provides the best results. For each\nVLTI/MIDI spectral channel, we fit the visibility of the 14 baselines. Thus, the previously defined model parameters are now\nfunctions of the wavelength. In Fig. 4, we plotted the value of\nthe best-fitted parameters as a function of the wavelength for the\n2-Gaussian model.\n\n5\n\nWe calculated an average \u03c72r over all spectral channels, i.e.,\n< \u03c72r (\u03bb) >\u03bb , and found a value of 1.5. Moreover, as expected\nfrom the global trend of the spectrally resolved visibilities, the\ngeometry does not strongly depend on the wavelength. The\nFWHM of major axis of the compact component varies from\n30\u00b12 mas at 8 \u03bcm to 37\u00b13 mas around 10\u03bcm and return to\n32\u00b13 mas around 12 \u03bcm. It remains unclear whether these small\nvariations, on the order of 2\u03c3, are significant or not. This is also\nthe case for the flattening of the compact component with variations between 1.7 and 2.0, and for the orientation of the major\naxis with variations between 60\u25e6 and 80\u25e6 , which are both on the\norder of 2\u03c3. The relative flux of the compact component is stable\nthrough the whole N-band; i.e., F1 = 0.7\u00b10.03. Finally, the size\nof the extended component is larger than 100 mas. This means\nthat it is fully resolved even by the shorter baselines.\nBy analyzing the results in the frame of a circumstellar dusty\ndisk, we can constrain a few geometrical parameters of the disk.\nFirst, we can deduce that the inner radius of the dusty disk lies\nwithin the compact component, so that its extension is smaller\nor equal to 15 mas. Considering a distance of 500 pc, this corresponds to an inner radius of the dusty disk smaller than 7.5 AU.\nSecond, we can directly derive the inclination angle of the disk\nin the case of the geometrically thin disk; i.e., i = arccos (b1 /a1 ) =\n57\u00b13\u25e6. However, the opening angle of the disk may not be negligible, so that we can, as shown by Meilland et al. (2007), only\nput a lower limit on the inclination of the object, i \u2265 54\u25e6 . Finally,\nwe can also confirm that the major axis of the disk is roughly\nperpendicular to the polarization measurements, \u03b8 = 70\u00b112\u25e6.\n3.2. H and K-band data (VLTI/AMBER)\n\nThe analysis of data from this spectral region is not trivial, since\nthe near-IR emission usually comes from different sources: the\nstellar radiation, the hot gas located closer to the star than the\ndust sublimation radius (in a dust-free region), and also the hot\ndust, mainly located at the inner radius of the dusty disk.\nWe started our analysis of the near-infrared VLTI/AMBER\nmeasurements by modeling the K-band data. The visibilities are\nplotted as a function of the spatial frequency in Fig 5 (right\npanel), where we clearly see that the object is fully resolved by\nthe longest baselines. However, a non-negligible part of the flux,\nin the range of 10-20%, is still unresolved, which probably represents the stellar flux.\nAnother interesting point is the absence of a sharp edge, such\nas an inner rim of the dusty disk, which would produce oscillations in the visibilities. This absence can be for three different causes: (a) the inner radius is very extended and thus overresolved even by the smallest baselines, (b) its contribution to\nthe total flux is small enough to reduce the oscillation amplitude\nto an undetectable level, and (c) there is no gap in emission between the inner gaseous envelope/disk and the inner rim of the\ndusty disk. We note that a combination of these causes can also\nbe possible. Whatever causes the absence of oscillations, it will\nstrongly prevent us from disentangling the gas and dust emission\nin the K-band.\nThus, to perform a model fitting of these data, we decided\nto test LITpro4 (Lyons Interferometric Tool prototype), a new\nsoftware developed by the Jean-Marie Mariotti Center (JMMC).\nIt uses a set of elementary geometrical functions and also the\nLM algorithm to minimize the \u03c72r . It is important to cite that we\ndid not use LITpro for the N-band analysis, because it is not yet\nable to perform an achromatic model fitting.\n4\n\nLITpro software available at http://www.jmmc.fr/litpro\n\n\f6\n\nBorges Fernandes et al.: The galactic unclassified B[e] star HD 50138\n\nFig. 3. VLTI/MIDI N-band spectrally resolved visibilities plotted as a function of the spatial frequency (B/\u03bb) for the 14 baselines.\nColors indicate the baselines position angle with respect to the polarization measurement by Yudin & Evans (1998). The color\nscale (i.e., blue, cyan, green, yellow, orange, and red) goes from blue for baselines parallel to the polarization angle to red for the\nperpendicular ones. The dots with error bars indicate the 10.7\u03bcm Keck measurements. The thin solid and dashed lines represent the\nvisibilities from Gaussian disks with different FWHM. The thick red solid line represents the model fitting aligned to the PA of the\nmajor axes of the 2-Gaussian distribution and the blue one to the PA of the minor axes.\nWe decided to start our model fitting by using the simplest\nmodel that could fit the data, i.e. an unresolved star plus an elliptical Gaussian model. Such a model can help us to derive the\ncharacteristic extension of the circumstellar environment. This\nsimple model (hereafter Model 1) has the following parameters:\nthe stellar relative flux (F\u22c6 ), and the Gaussian relative flux (F1 ),\nits FWHM of the minor axis (FWHMminor1 ), the orientation of\nthe major axis on the sky-plane (\u03b8), and the flattening. Since the\nflux is normalized, we have F1 = 1 - F\u22c6 , and consequently, Model\n1 has four free parameters.\nThe result of the model fitting is presented in Table 4,\nand with \u03c72r = 40.8, we see that Model 1 failed to reproduce\nthe spatial-frequency visibility variations (Fig. 5, right panel).\nHowever, we note that the flattening and orientation of the model\n1, i.e. 1.7\u00b10.3 and 66\u00b19\u25e6, are compatible within 1\u03c3 with those\nones derived from the 10.7\u03bcm modeling. In addition, we could\nalso, based on the flattening, estimate the inclination related to\nthe line of sight of the circumstellar structure, i = 54\u00b18\u25e6 , which\nalso agrees with our N-band results.\nSince the gas and dust emission regions may have different\ncharacteristic sizes, we also tried to model the environment with\na more complex geometry, consisting of an unresolved star plus\ntwo Gaussian distributions, with the same flattening and orientation onto the sky plane. This model (hereafter Model 2) has\nthe following parameters: the stellar flux (F\u22c6 ), the first Gaussian\nflux (F1 ) and its FWHM of the minor axis (FWHMminor1 ), the\nsecond Gaussian relative flux (F2 ), its FWHM of the minor axis\n(FWHMminor2 ), and the Gaussians flattening and orientation (\u03b8).\nAs described for Model 1, owing to the normalized flux, Model\n\nTable 4.

Thus, we decided to keep Model 2 as the reference for the K-band (see Table 4 and Fig. 5, right panel).\nThe orientation of the envelope, its flattening, and its inclination related to the line of sight, determined by Model 2 (1.7\u00b10.3,\n77\u00b12\u25e6, and 54\u00b18\u25e6 , respectively) are also compatible with our\nN-band analysis.

The relative flux of the compact component\n(61\u00b16%) dominates the K-band emission.\n\n\fBorges Fernandes et al.: The galactic unclassified B[e] star HD 50138\n\n7\n\nFig. 4.

Model fitting of the VLTI/AMBER data, using the parameters obtained by LITpro: right panel for the K-band assuming both\nscenarios as described in the text for Model 1 (dotted lines) and 2 (solid lines), and left panel for the H-band assuming a scenario\nlike Model 2. The different colors follow the same description as in Fig. 3, representing the orientation of the baselines.\nAs stated before, it is really hard to conclude about the sizes\nof the gas and dust emission regions from this simple modeling. We know from the VLTI/MIDI modeling that the inner rim\nof the dusty disk is smaller than 7.5 AU, but both the compact\n(HWHM \u223c 1.3 AU) and extended components (HWHM \u223c 6 AU)\nare compatible with this. Thus, we have tried to substitute in our\nmodels one of the components by a ring. Unfortunately, we did\nnot manage to obtain any better agreement with such a model\nthan for Model 2. Nevertheless, the ring radius cannot be smaller\nthan 3 AU, otherwise oscillations in the visibilities would be\nseen even for the longest baselines. Thus, it finally seems that\nthe large component probably represents the inner radius of the\ndusty disk.\n\nIn addition, we have also tried to model the H-band\nVLTI/AMBER data, where the quality is clearly lower compared\nto the K-band data (Fig. 5, left panel). Using the same scenario\nas described by Model 2, we did not manage to constrain properly the model parameters, especially the extensions, flattening,\nand orientation of the circumstellar environment. However, we\ncan consider that only the relative flux of the components would\nchange in the H-band compared to the K-band. Thus, we fixed\nthe geometrical parameters with the same values as used for the\nK-band, and we derived the fluxes for the three components: F\u22c6\n= 0.22 \u00b1 0.04, F1 = 0.65 \u00b1 0.10, and F2 = 0.13 \u00b1 0.07. The\ncorresponding visibilities are overplotted in Fig. 5 (left panel).\n\n\f8\n\nBorges Fernandes et al.: The galactic unclassified B[e] star HD 50138\n\n4. Discussion\nA good coherence was obtained considering the model-fitting\nof VLTI/AMBER, VLTI/MIDI and Keck data, allowing us to resolve and describe in detail for the first time the circumstellar environment of HD 50138. In addition, based on our data and their\ndifferent project baselines and position angles, we cannot verify that there is variability in the interferometric measurements\nassociated to the spectral variations of this object that were described in Paper I. Thus, we can now draw a general picture for\nthis object.\n4.1. General structure of the dusty disk\n\nBased on our model fitting for different data, we saw that the\nstar is seen under an intermediate inclination angle of 56\u00b14\u25e6 and\nis surrounded by a large dusty disk, with a major-axis roughly\nperpendicular to the polarization angle, \u03b8 = 71\u00b17\u25e6). This disk\nprobably has a small opening angle, which can explain the photospheric lines seen in the high-resolution spectra of HD 50138\n(Paper I). Moreover in this case, since the dust would be out of\nour line of sight, it does not significantly contribute to the visible polarization, in agreement with the results of Bjorkman et al.\n(1998).\nFrom our models in the mid-IR, we see that the dusty disk\nemits up to a large distance from the central star, i.e. more than\n30 AU. Moreover, the flux measured by the VLTI/MIDI spectrum is about 13% lower than the value provided by IRAS LRS\n(see Fig 2), both with similar spectral resolutions. This difference can be considered quite small, since the uncertainty of the\nVLTI/MIDI flux is around 20%. In addition, the VLTI/MIDI\nfield of view (FOV) is around 1\u2032\u2032 at 8\u03bcm and of 1.5\u2032\u2032 at 13\u03bcm,\nwhile the IRAS LRS one covered a region of 7.5\u2032 . Based on this,\nwe can consider that VLTI/MIDI spectrum represents the whole\nN-band emission of HD 50138, thereby avoiding any external\ncontamination.\n4.2. Mineralogy of HD 50138 dust\n\nThe VLTI/MIDI spectrum also allows us to qualitatively analyze\nthe mineralogy of the circumstellar medium of HD 50138. We\nnote the presence of a 10\u03bcm emission bump that corresponds\nto the silicate band, which does not seem to affect the visibility measurements. However, as already mentioned in Sect. 3.1.2,\nthis is probably because the silicate band is as broad as the\nVLTI/MIDI spectral bandwidth.\nIn addition, the VLTI/MIDI spectra, even from shorter baselines, show features from cristalline silicate grains, such as\northo-enstatite (Fig. 2). This does not agree with the expectations for young stellar objects (van Boeckel 2008 and di Folco et\nal. 2009). However, a more detailed analysis of the dust composition, associated to a larger sample of data, becomes necessary\nto provide a complete study of the dust content, as a function of\nthe distance from the star.\n4.3. Separating the stellar, gas, and dust emissions\n\nIn our K-band modeling, we found that HD 50138 circumstellar environment can be divided into two components. The first\none, fully resolved even by the smallest baselines, contributes to\n27\u00b17% of the flux. A lower limit on its extension around 24 mas\n(12 AU) can be set. Comparing this component with the N-band\nmodeling, we conclude that it probably represents the K-band\ncontribution of dusty disk inner rim. However, only a radiative\n\ntransfer code, which couples gas and dust, will allow us to derive\nthe radius of the inner dusty disk properly. It is also clear that,\neven in this case, we will not find an specific inner radius, but a\nrange of radii, depending of the grain size.\nThe second component is much more compact with FWHM\n= 5.1\u00b11.1 mas (i.e. 2.6 AU), and it represents 61\u00b16% of the K\nband, which can be associated to hot gas emission. Concerning\nthe mid-IR emission, since the N-band stellar flux itself is obviously negligible, it can only originate in the dust surrounding\nHD 50138.\nThrough the stellar, dust, and circumstellar gas relative\nfluxes, and photometric and spectro-photometric measurements\nin H, K, and N bands, it is possible to derive the flux contribution\nof each component. We used 2MASS measurements to estimate\nthe total flux for the H and K-bands, and the VLTI/MIDI spectrum (as cited in the Sect. 4.1) for the total flux of the N-band.\nThe resulting fluxes are shown in Table 5.\n4.4. The gaseous inner disk\n\nThanks to the previous section, we now have suggested that the\ncompact component of our K-band model represents the emission of the hot gas surrounding HD 50138. Moreover, the flattening of this component, i.e. 1.7\u00b10.3, is compatible with the one\ndetermined in N-band for the dusty disk, i.e. 1.82\u00b10.02, considering the geometrical model at 10.7\u03bcm. The major axis orientation of these two components is also compatible. Therefore,\nmost of the hot gas must be located in a disk. This disk may be\na Keplerian accretion disk, but just in case of a young nature for\nHD 50138, or even an outflowing disk wind for a more evolved\nscenario.\nTo distinguish between these different scenarios, it is necessary to constrain not only the circumstellar environment geometry but also its kinematics. This can be done by coupling the\nhigh-angular resolution of modern interferometers with a sufficiently high spectral resolution. Based on this, observing programs for VLTI/AMBER are currently being prepared, using its\nhigh spectral resolution mode (R=12000).\nAnother interesting point is to compare the assumption of a\ngeometrically thin disk seen under an intermediate inclination\nangle with the Balmer lines profiles described in Paper I, i.e.\nH\u03b1, H\u03b2, H\u03b3, and H\u03b4. In spite of their variations, all these emission lines clearly show a strong and narrow absorption component that is probably formed in the circumstellar environment.\nThus, a non-negligible part of the emitting gas must be located\nin the line of sight, i.e 56\u25e6 , hence far above the equatorial disk.\nConsequently, this gaseous emission could come from the stellar\nwind, as described for Herbig stars by Kraus et al. (2008).\n\nTable 5.

Conclusions\nHD 50138 is a curious star whose evolutionary stage is unknown. In this paper, we could describe the geometry of both\nthe gaseous and dusty circumstellar environments, based on the\nanalysis of recent interferometric data. Through geometrical analytical modeling, it was possible to resolve a circumstellar disk\naround HD 50138 and to describe its parameters for the first time\nin detail.\nHowever, more observations, especially from the VLTI and\nwith high S/N, are planned. The analysis of these data, in association with 3-D codes, will allow us to derive not only the\nphysical parameters of the dusty environment precisely, but also\nthose from the gas emitting regions. In addition, new data will\nmake the image reconstruction of HD 50138 possible. This information will be extremely valuable for better understanding\nthe physical mechanisms responsible for the formation of the\nB[e] phenomenon.\nAcknowledgements.
