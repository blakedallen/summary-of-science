Introduction\nThe equation of state(EoS) of QCD, i.e. thermodynamic quantities such as the pressure (p),\nenergy density (\u03b5 ), or entropy density (s) as a function of the temperature, is important in understanding the high-temperature behavior of QCD. The EoS is not only of theoretical interest, but is\ndirectly applicable to the dynamics of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), whether in the context of\ninterpreting the results of heavy-ion experiments or modelling the behavior of hot, dense matter in\nthe early universe.\nCurrently, some aspects of the EoS are accessible at high temperatures via perturbation theory\n[1], or at low temperatures via the hadron resonance gas model (HRG) [2]. However, a truly nonperturbative, first-principles calculation can only be done using lattice QCD.\nRecently, there have been several detailed studies of the QCD EoS using improved actions and\nphysical (or almost-physical) values for the light and strange quark masses [3, 4, 5]. While these\nstudies accurately represent the three lightest quark flavors, they, like all previous calculations,\nneglect the effect of the charm quarks. However, recent work [6] based on perturbation theory\nindicates that the charm quark contribution may start to become significant at temperatures T \u223c 350\nMeV, well within the temperature range covered by these latest EoS calculations.\nIn this work, we present a partially quenched study of the charm quark contribution to the\nQCD equation of state using p4fat3 fermions on a 2+1f gauge background in the temperature range\n0.90Tc < T < 4.2Tc . Currently, the calculations are done only for Nt = 4 lattices, with the intention\nof continuing to Nt = 6 and possibly Nt = 8.\n\n2. Equation of State on the lattice\nWe will first review the formalism for calculating the equation of state on the lattice via the\n\"integral method\", as described in [7]. First, consider the grand canonical partition function of\nQCD at vanishing quark chemical potential (\u03bcq = 0):\nZ(V, T ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u0012 Z\nZ\n3\n[DA\u03bc ][D\u03a8][D \u03a8\u0304] exp \u2212 d x\nV\n\n1/T\n0\n\nd \u03c4 LQCD\n\n\u0013\n\n(2.1)\n\nWe can extract various thermodynamics quantities from ln Z(T,V ) such as the grand canonical\npotential (\u03a9(T,V )), pressure (p), or energy density (\u03b5 ):\n\u03a9(T,V ) = T ln Z(T,V ); \u03b5 =\n\n1 \u2202 ln Z\n\u2202 ln Z\nE\n=\u2212\n; p=T\nV\nV \u2202 (1/T )\n\u2202V\n\n(2.2)\n\nIn the thermodynamic limit, the grand canonical potential is an extensive quantity (\u03a9 \u223c V ). Thus,\nwe can write:\nT 2 \u2202 ln Z(V, T )\nT\np = ln Z(T,V ); \u03b5 =\n(2.3)\nV\nV\n\u2202T\nWe can also define another quantity, called the interaction measure I, which is the trace of the\nenergy-momentum tensor:\n\u03b5 \u2212 3p\n\u2202 p\nI\n=\n=T\n( )\n(2.4)\n4\n4\nT\nT\n\u2202T T4\n2\n\n\fCharm Quarks and the QCD Equation of State\n\nMichael Cheng\n\nUnfortunately, calculating the pressure by computing ln Z(T,V ) directly is not possible using\nstochastic Monte Carlo methods. However, we are able to compute certain derivatives of ln Z(T,V )\nwhich, in the lattice formulation, become the expectation values of operators. In particular, we can\nobtain the gauge action and the chiral condensate in this manner:\nhSg i =\n\n\u2202 ln Z\n;\n\u2202\u03b2\n\n\u03c8\u0304\u03c8q =\n\n\u2202 ln Z\n\u2202 m\u0303q\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhere \u03b2 = 6/g20 is related to the bare coupling g0 and m\u0303q denotes a bare quark mass.\nOn the lattice, finite temperatures can be simulated by limiting the temporal size of the lattice.\nThis is directly analagous to restricting the integral in 2.1 to a finite interval in the imaginary time\ndirection. The temperature is related to the temporal extent by T \u22121 = Nt a(g0 , m\u0303q (g0 )), where the\nlattice spacing a is a function of both g0 and m\u0303q , and the bare quark masses m\u0303q must be adjusted as\na function of g0 along some renormalization group trajectory to keep physical quantities fixed, i.e.\na line of constant physics.\nWe can rewrite the expression 2.4 for the interaction measure in terms of lattice quantities:\n!\n\u0012 \u00133\n\u0001\n\u2202 m\u0303q\nI\n\u2202\u03b2\nNt\n(2.6)\n\u03c8\u0304\u03c8q (T ) \u2212 \u03c8\u0304\u03c8q (0)\n=\n(hSg (T )i \u2212 hSg (0)i) + \u2211\nT4\nNs\n\u2202 ln a\nq \u2202 ln a\nHere, the sum over the index q indicates a sum over all quark flavors. We have also normalized the\ninteraction measure by subtracting the T = 0 contribution, disentangling the vacuum contribution\nfrom the thermal effects.\nUsing I, we can reconstruct other thermodynamic quantities. For example, we use 2.4 to\nexpress the pressure in terms of lattice quantities:\nP\n=\nT4\n\nZ T\nI\n\nd ln T \u2032\nT \u20324\n\u0012 \u00133 Z \u03b2\n\u2202 m\u0303q\nNt\nP\n(hSg (T )i \u2212 hSg (0)i) + \u2211\n=\n\u2032\n4\nT\nNs\n\u03b20\nq \u2202\u03b2\n\n(2.7)\n\n0\n\n\u03c8\u0304\u03c8q (T ) \u2212 \u03c8\u0304\u03c8q (0)\n\n\u0001\n\n!\n\nd\u03b2 \u2032\n\n(2.8)\n\nOnce we have I(T ) and p(T ), we can easily reconstruction the energy density, \u03b5 (T ), or the entropy\ndensity, s(T ). For a more detailed discussion of our EoS calculation with 2+1 flavors, see [5].\n\n3. Calculation Method\nFor this calculation, we are concerned only with the charm quark contribution. The relevant\npart of 2.6 is:\n\u0012 \u00133\nNt\nd \u03b2 \u2202 m\u0303c\nIc\n(h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8c (T )i \u2212 h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8c (0)i)\n=\n(3.1)\n4\nT\nNs\nd ln a \u2202 \u03b2\n\nTo calculate \u03c8\u0304\u03c8c , we make partially quenched measurements of the chiral condensate on previously generated 2+1f gauge configurations, both at finite temperature (Nt = 4) and zero temperature (Nt = 32). These dynamical configurations use the p4fat3 fermion action [8] , and a tree-level\nimproved Symanzik gauge action.\n3\n\n\fCharm Quarks and the QCD Equation of State\n\nMichael Cheng\n\nIn order to determine the temperature of each ensemble, we have chosen to set the scale using\nthe static quark potential parameter r0 . r0 is defined as:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2 dVqq\u0304 (r)\nr\n= 1.65\n(3.2)\ndr\nr=r0\nWe can then convert to physical units by using r0 = 0.469(7) fm. [9]. Note that the bare quark\nmasses (m\u0303ud and m\u0303s ) are tuned as a function of \u03b2 so that physical quantities such as m\u03c0 r0 , m\u03b7 r0 ,\nand mK r0 take on approximately constant values over the entire temperature range.\nTo determine Ic , we not only need \u03c8\u0304\u03c8c on zero and finite temperature lattices, but also\nd \u03b2 /d ln a. We can deduce d \u03b2 /d ln a from our scale-setting calculations of r0 :\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202 ln(a/r0 ) \u22121\nd\u03b2\nd\u03b2\n(3.3)\n=a\n=\nd ln a\nda\n\u2202\u03b2\nTo get a smooth function for d \u03b2 /d ln a, we fit ra0 (\u03b2 ) to a renormalization-group inspired ansatz.\nTable 1 gives details of the input parameters for the lattices, the number of trajectories for the\ndifferent ensembles, as well as r0 and T /Tc .

Unfortunately, m\u0303c is quite large on the available lattices, so the ratio m\u0303c /m\u0303ud\ndepends on \u03b2 and the particular quantity used to set m\u0303c .\nIn order to understand the extent of this scaling violation, and how it affects our calculation,\nwe have chosen to fix m\u0303c by setting two different charmonium states to their physical masses (m\u03b7c\n= 2.980 GeV and mJ/\u03a8 = 3.097 GeV). This produces a range of values 0.16 < m\u0303c < 2.4, with\nexact figures given in Table 1. As seen in Figure 1, we find fairly reasonable scaling (m\u0303c /m\u0303ud \u223c\n170) for the finer lattice spacings (\u03b2 > 3.5 \u2192 T > 1.7Tc ). However, as we lower \u03b2 onto coarser\nlattices, we find that this approximate scaling breaks down, and this ratio m\u0303c /m\u0303ud begins to increase\ndramatically. We also find that using the \u03b7c state tends to give a systematically higher value for m\u0303c ,\nalthough this ultimately does not have a large affect on the final calculation.\nOnce we have m\u0303c (\u03b2 ), we can fit this data to a RG-inspired ansatz for the running of the bare\nquark mass. This allows us to calculate a smooth curve for \u2202 m\u0303c /\u2202 \u03b2 , also shown in Figure 1. We\nsee that this \u03b2 -function increase s dramatically as we move to smaller \u03b2 , in contrast to the scaled\nversion of \u2202 m\u0303ud /\u2202 \u03b2 , which shows a much milder \u03b2 -dependence.\n\n5. Results\nFigure 2 shows our results for the charm contribution using both \u03b7c and J/\u03a8 to determine m\u0303c ,\nas well as a free-field calculation using the physical value of the charm mass mc \u2248 1.2GeV . The\nchoice of \u03b7c or J/\u03a8 does have some effect, but both curves share the same qualitative features.\nNotably, the interaction measure Ic increases drastically as we move through the transition. This is\nconsistent with the notion that the charmonium states are the lightest charm states that contribute\nbelow the transition, and thus are exponentially suppressed by their heavy mass.\nIt is interesting to note that the value of Ic already becomes quite large even just above the\ntransition (T \u223c 1.1Tc ), decaying away slowly as the temperature is increased. This is in contrast to\nthe free-field calculation, where the interaction measure peaks at T \u223c 0.35mc \u2248 400MeV , although\nof course the free-field result knows nothing about the crossover transition. Perhaps more surprising\nis the fact that Ic is significantly greater than the free-field value for T < 3Tc .

This causes p and \u03b5 to overshoot their\ncontinuum Stefan-Boltzmann values T \u2192 \u221e by a large amount, even at finite temperature. This\ndifference may be attributed to finite lattice spacing corrections at Nt = 4. Indeed, for the 2+1f\ncalculation, the contribution of the quark condensates to (\u03b5 \u2212 3p)/T 4 decreases going from Nt = 4\nto Nt = 6.\nFigure 2 also shows the charm contribution superimposed on the 2+1f calculation at Nt = 4.\nAlthough we see little change in the interaction measure because of the high 2+1f peak, the pressure\nand energy change by quite a large amount for T > Tc .\n\n6. Conclusion\nWe have made a partially quenched calculation of the charm quark equation of state. Current\nEoS studies are in a temperature regime that is a significant fraction of the charm quark mass,\n6\n\n\fCharm Quarks and the QCD Equation of State\n\nMichael Cheng\n\nwhere the dynamics of the charm quark may have a significant effect and can no longer be ignored.\nAdmittedly, this calculation has unquantified, possibly large systematic errors. First of all,\nour calculations are partially quenched, so that the full dynamics of the charm quark may not be\naccurately reflected in their \"back-reaction\" on the gauge fields. To the extent that the charm quark\nis heavy, this should be a small effect, but may be problematic at higher temperatures and at finer\nlattice spacings. Secondly, m\u0303c is a large fraction of, or even exceeds, the lattice spacing on many\nof the lattices on which we measure. This introduces large cut-off effects, and it is appropriate to\nask whether the p4 fermion formulation can give even a reasonable facsimile of the charm quark\ndynamics at these heavy masses.\nAs there are no plans for large-scale simulations involving a dynamical charm quark, it seems\nwe must tolerate the first problem. The second problem may be alleviated somewhat be moving to\nfiner lattice spacings, (Nt = 6, 8). This may give us a better grasp of the discretization errors in the\ncurrent calculation. Furthermore, the recent development of the HISQ action [10], which, among\nother improvements, removes the leading order O(ma)4 corrections to the dispersion relation at\ntree-level, provides another possible tool to mitigate the large cut-off effects currently present.\nThe future plans for this calculation is extension to Nt = 6 and possibly Nt = 8, as well as\ninvestigating the possibility of adapting the methods used by the HISQ action. Hopefully, this will\nallow us to better understand why the Nt = 4 calculation so badly overshoots the Stefan-Boltzmann\nlimit, and to better quantify the cut-off effects.\n\n7.
