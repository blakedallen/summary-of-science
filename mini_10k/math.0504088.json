This answers\nthe strong version of the so-called \"Ten Martini Problem\". When specialized to\nthe particular case where the coupling constant is equal to one, it follows that\nthe \"Hofstadter butterfly\" has for any quantum Hall conductance the exact\nnumber of components prescribed by the recursive scheme to build this fractal\nstructure.\n.\nIntroduction\nThe present work is concerned with the spectral properties of the simplest kind\nof discrete Schroedinger type operators with an almost periodic potential. These\noperators form a self-dual class with respect to the Fourier transform, with exactly one operator being invariant. More specifically, a precise one-to-one relationship between gaps and admissible gap labelling numbers will be established.\nWhile relegating the technical formulation of the problem and the outline of its\nproof to the first section, we are going to dwell for the rest of the introduction\non the significance of this result in the special case of the self-dual operator for\nphysics and mathematics.\nRecent progress that has occurred in solid state physics through the development\nof new experiments which led to improved measurements, has made it possible\nto obtain improved physical evidence for the presence of the butterfly fractal\nspectrum. In [GSUKNKS] portions of the \"Hofstadter butterfly\" have been\nobserved in lateral superlattices patterned on GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure\nby exploiting the quantum Hall conductance as a diagnostic tool. One way to\nview the significance of the present paper is the recognition, that this diagnostic\napproach to detecting the fractal stucture experimentally is on solid theoretical\nground, at least as long as the \"Hofstadter butterfly\" is accepted as a paradigm\nfor the quantum Hall effect: Knowing the specific value of the quantum Hall\nconductance, it is possible to allocate the corresponding gap components in the\nfractal structure in a prescribed way, without running the risk of missing one.\nThis follows from the considerations in [OA], where it was shown that, assuming\nthat the strong version of the \"Ten Martini problem\" holds, the components\nassociated with the same quantum Hall conductance can be counted by means\nof a specific combinatorial formula. In another experiment cold neutral atoms\nin an optical lattice were used to exhibit salient features of the butterfly fractal\n[JZ]. The employment of lasers allows the simulation of a magnetic flux through\n1\n\n\fthe lattice. The success of this approach for specific rotation numbers depends\non the visibility of the particle density, which in turn depends on its periodicity.\nAs shown by a specific experiment in [JZ] (FIG 4b), the visibility decreases for\n1\n. Again, as the present work will show, it\nthe irrational rotation number \u03b1 = 2\u03c0\nis reassuring to know, that the butterfly fractal does not allow for unexpected\ntransitions at irrational rotation numbers to occur, which could not be picked\nup through a suitably designed experiment.\nWe turn now to the mathematical significance of the present work, which at\nthis point is somewhat speculative in nature. The set of quantum Hall numbers\nis a cyclic subgroup of the additive group of real numbers. If g is the posiitve\ngenerator of this group, then each quantum Hall number q can be written as q =\nkg, for a suitable integer k . As was shown in [OA] under the assumption that the\nstrong version of the \"Ten Martini conjecture\" holds, the number of components\nin the butterfly fractal with a common positive quantum Hall number q is equal\nto\nn\nX\n\u03c6(j),\n\u03a6(2k), where \u03a6(n) =\nj=1\n\nand \u03c6 is Euler's totient function. On the other hand, an observation by J. Franel\nfrom the 1920's asserts that the Riemann hypothesis is true if and only if the\nrelation\nX (n)\nj 2\n(rj \u2212\n) = O(n\u22121+\u03b5 )\n\u03a6(n)\nj\u2266\u03a6(n)\n\n(n)\n\nholds for any \u03b5 > 0. Here rj is the jth Farey fraction of order n. For a detailed\nexposition of this subject see Edmund Landau's lectures on number theory [L],\nBand 2, Kapitel 13. Notice that the Farey fractions, in the order as they appear\nin this asymptotic formula, occupy a natural position in the butterfly fractal.\nSo it appears that the butterfly fractal holds information about the Riemann\nhypothesis, the exact nature of which remains yet to be determined. Inspired\nby the color coding of the butterfly fractal according to the Hall conductance,\nwhich was also introduced in [OA], and which has become very popular in recent\nyears, it is tempting to take a cue from Marc Kac, who is not only alleged to\nhave offered ten martinis as a reward for the solution of the eponymous problem\nwhich is the subject of this work, but who also famously asked \"Can one hear\nthe shape of a drum?\", and pose the question, \"Can one see the hue of the\nRiemann hypothesis?\"\nFinally, we turn to a description of the organization of the paper. In section\n1 the problem will be introduced in a form that is conducive to the employment of tools which are needed to solve it. Based on three propositions, two\nof which are known results, while the third one still needs to be established,\nthe short proof of the major result will be given in that section. In section 2\nmaterial from this author's previous work will be assembled in a fashion that\nfacilitates its usage in the present context, and a number of preparatory results\n\n2\n\n\fwill be established. In section 3 the proof for the outstanding proposition will\nbe provided.\n.\nSection 1\nThe observation that gaps tend to open up readily for small coupling constants\ndue to basic perturbations of the degenerate case, that is when the coupling constant is equal to zero, naturally leads to a search for an argument that allows\none to show that those gaps can not close as the coupling constant increases.\nThe advantage of such an approach goes beyond mere expediency. By establishing the persistence of gaps as opposed to proving the existence of gaps for\nspecific parameters, one can reach through to the elusive self-dual case \"from\nthe outside\". It is the purpose of the present work to develop such an argument. Earlier attempts can be readily traced in the literature. For instance the\nmajor thrust in [HKS] is along the same line: If one substitutes the conjecture\nC3 in that paper, which at this point remains unproven, by the combination of\nProposition 2 and Proposition 3 below, then one can simply follow the argument provided in \"Remarque 3.2.4\" in [HKS] to obtain the desired result. In\nconclusion our proof will require two legs to stand on: The first leg establishes\nthat gaps with prescribed labels open up for sufficiently small (but by no means\nuniform!) coupling constants. This has been rigorously shown in [HKS]. The\nsecond leg guarantees that (open) gaps can't close, as the coupling constant\nincreases. Our argument to accomplish this has two components. First, we\nneed to show that if a gap closes, then it follows that the Lyapunov exponent,\nconsidered as a function of two real parameters, namely the coupling constant\nand the spectral parameter, has a local maximum in one of the resolvent sets.\nSecond, we need to prove that the Lyapunov exponent does not have any critical\npoints. It is the proof of the second component that will occupy the main body\nof the paper.\nWe turn now to outlining the setting for the proof of that particular component.\nLet \u03b1 be an irrational number, let u and v be unitary operators satisfying the\nrelation\n(1.1)\nuv = e2\u03c0\u03b1i vu,\nand let A\u03b1 be the (abstract) C \u2217 -algebra generated by u and v . Furthermore,\nlet \u03c4 be the unique tracial state on A\u03b1 . This is a positive linear functional,\nstandardized by setting \u03c4 ( ) = 1, where denotes the unit element in A\u03b1 , such\nthat \u03c4 (ab) = \u03c4 (ba) holds for all elements in a, b\u01ebA\u03b1 . In this setting we define\nfor any positive coupling constant \u03b2 the almost Mathieu operator as follows,\n\ne\n\ne\n\n(1.2)\nh(\u03b2) = u + u\u2217 + \u03b2(v + v \u2217 ).\nAs usual, the upper right asterisk denotes the adjoint of an operator. The\nintegrated density of states can now be identified with the restriction of the\n3\n\n\ffunctional \u03c4 to the abelian C \u2217 -algebra generated by h(\u03b2). To obtain the integrated density of states proper, all one has to do is to represent this restricted\nfunctional by a probability measure on the spectrum of h(\u03b2). In light of the\ncomments made above we can now formulate our first proposition which establishes the first leg of the argument.\n\nZ Z\n\n1.1 Proposition ([HKS]) For any number r\u01eb[0, 1]\u2229 +\u03b1 there exists a positive\nnumber \u03b20 with the property that for any \u03b2\u01eb(0, \u03b20 ], the operator h(\u03b2) has a gap\nin its spectrum with the label r . More specifically, there exists a real number\ns\u03b2 in the resolvent set of h(\u03b2), such that the spectral projection p associated\nwith the interval (\u2212\u221e, s\u03b2 ] has the property \u03c4 (p) = r.\nWe turn now to the second leg. First we need to define the Lyapunov exponent\nin a way that is compatible with the present settings.\nL:\n\nR \u00d7 C \u2192 R, L(\u03b2, z) = \u03c4 (log |h(\u03b2) \u2212 z|).\n1\n\nWhile the operator log |h(\u03b2)\u2212z| = log[(h(\u03b2)\u2212z)(h(\u03b2)\u2212 z\u0304)] 2 is an element of A\u03b1\nfor z\u01eb \\Sp(h(\u03b2)), Sp(h(\u03b2)) denoting the spectrum of h(\u03b2), this is not the case\nfor z\u01ebSp(h(\u03b2)). However, for any complex number this operator is contained\nin L1 (A, \u03c4 ), the space of \"integrable operators\" associated with A\u03b1 and \u03c4 . By\nvirtue of the so-called Thouless formula the number L(\u03b2, z) is seen to coincide\nwith the usual definition of the Lyapunov exponent for h(\u03b2) at z . We can now\nformulate our next statement.\n\nC\n\n1.2 Proposition The function L is jointly continuous is both variables. Moreover, for \u03b2 \u2264 1, L(\u03b2, z) = 0 for every z\u01ebSp(h(\u03b2)).\nWhile this follows for rotation numbers satisfying a diophantine condition from\nthe present author's earlier work in conjunction with the semicontinuity of the\nspectrum (for badly approximable numbers see [R4], Proposition 2.12, and for\nsufficiently well approximable numbers see [R2], Corollary 2.3), a proof which\ndoes not rely on any diophantine condition is implicit in [BJ]. Indeed, the crucial\nProposition 9 towards the end of that paper is valid for any pair of sufficiently\nsmooth potentials, not just those which differ by the spectral parameter E . The\nremaining argument then carries through essentially without change.\nThe third statement, which will be proved in section 2 and section 3, is as\nfollows.\n\nR\n\n1.3 Proposition For every z\u01eb \\Sp(h(\u03b2)),\n(\u03c4 ((h(\u03b2) \u2212 z)\u22121 ), \u03c4 ((h(\u03b2) \u2212 z)\u22121 v)) 6= (0, 0).\nThe following theorem, whose proof is the main objective in the sequel, has\nmany precursors. The most up-to-date partial result appears to be [AJ], where\nthe stated claim is that the strong version of the \"Ten Martini Problem\" holds\nfor a set of badly approximable rotation numbers, and for all coupling constants\n4\n\n\fother than 0 and 1. For a survey of contributions that preceded this partial\nresult the reader is referred to that paper.\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nR\n\n1.4 Theorem For every r\u01eb[0, 1] \u2229 ( + \u03b1 ) there exists s\u01eb \\Sp(h(\u03b2)) such that\nthe spectral projection p associated with the interval (\u2212\u221e, s] has the property\n\u03c4 (p) = r.\nProof : By duality it suffices to consider the case 0 < \u03b2 \u2264 1 only. Let r\u01eb[0, 1] \u2229\n( + \u03b1 ), and choose \u03b20 as in Proposition 1.1. For some \u03b2\u0303\u01eb(0, \u03b20 ) let s\u03b2\u0303 be as\nin Proposition 1.1. Let \u03a9r be the connected component of R = {(\u03b2, t)\u01eb + \u00d7\n/t\u01eb \\Sp(h(\u03b2))} containing the point (\u03b2\u0303, s\u03b2\u0303 ). Since \u03b2\u0303 can be chosen arbitrarily\nclose to zero, it suffices to show that \u03a9r contains a point whose first coordinate\nis equal to 1. Suppose this were not true. Then \u03a9r \u2282 [0, 1] \u00d7 [\u22124, 4], and\ntherefore \u03a9 r is compact. By Proposition 1.2 the function L is continuous on\n\u03a9 r , and it takes the value zero on the boundary \u2202\u03a9 r . It follows that L has a\nlocal maximum at some point (\u03b2e , se ) in \u03a9r . Since L is infinitely differentiable\nin \u03a9r , the gradient of L at (\u03b2e , se ) vanishes. Thus\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nR\n\nR R\n\n\u2202L\n(\u03b2e , se ) = \u03c4 ((se \u2212 h(\u03b2e ))\u22121 ) = 0,\n\u2202z\n\u2202L\n(\u03b2e , se ) = \u03c4 ((h(\u03b2e ) \u2212 se )\u22121 (v + v \u2217 )) = 2\u03c4 ((h(\u03b2e ) \u2212 se )\u22121 v) = 0.\n\u2202\u03b2\nBy Proposition 1.3 this is impossible.\nRemarks: 1) While the first of the two partial derivatives occurring in the proof\nis obvious, the second one warrants a few words of explanation. Differentiating\nthe first of the above partial derivatives with respect to \u03b2, by invoking the\nformula\n\u2202\n(z \u2212 h(\u03b2))\u22121 = (z \u2212 h(\u03b2))\u22121 (v + v \u2217 )(z \u2212 h(\u03b2))\u22121 ,\n\u2202\u03b2\nand then antidifferentiating the result with respect to z yields the claimed formula plus a function which depends on \u03b2 only, f (\u03b2) say. In order to show that\nf (\u03b2) is actually zero, one would simply like to let z approach infinity, because\n\u2202L\n\u2202\u03b2 then approaches zero. This is of course impossible, since z is confined to a\n(bounded) gap. Therefore one has to replace the real parameter z by a complex\none, z = t + i\u03b5, for a small positive number \u03b5. Repeating the steps just outlined\nin this particular situation, and then letting \u03b5 approach zero, yields the claimed\nformula for the partial derivative \u2202L\n\u2202\u03b2 .\n2) It is worthwhile mentioning, that at this stage it is already clear that any\npossible critical point for the function L has to be a local maximum. Indeed,\ntaking the second partial derivatives\n\u22022L\n(\u03b2, z) = \u2212\u03c4 ((z \u2212 h(\u03b2))\u22122 ),\n\u2202z 2\n\u22022L\n(\u03b2, z) = \u03c4 ((z \u2212 h(\u03b2))\u22121 (v + v \u2217 )(z \u2212 h(\u03b2))\u22121 ) = \u03c4 ((z \u2212 h(\u03b2))\u22122 (v + v \u2217 )),\n\u2202\u03b2\u2202z\n5\n\n\f\u22022L\n(\u03b2, z) = \u2212\u03c4 ([(z \u2212 h(\u03b2))\u22121 (v + v \u2217 )]2 ),\n\u2202\u03b2 2\nand applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality shows that the determinant of the\nHessian of the function L is strictly positive. Since the diagonal entries of the\nHessian are negative numbers, the claim follows.\n.\nSection 2\nWe now turn to the expansion and refinement of the settings introduced in\nSection 1. In the sequel we assume throughout that \u03b1 is a fixed irrational\nnumber, and that \u03b2 is a positive number less than 1. For p, q\u01eb , we define the\nstandardized monomials\nwpq = e\u2212pq\u03c0\u03b1i up v q ,\n\nZ\n\nC\n\nand for z\u01eb \\Sp(h(\u03b2)),\ncpq (z) = \u03c4 ((h(\u03b2) \u2212 z)\u22121 )wpq .\nThe standardization ensures that these numbers are real valued whenever z is\na real number. The double sequence {cpq (z)} solves the following system linear\nequations for s = z,\n(2.1)\ncos \u03c0\u03b1q(xp+1,q + xp\u22121,q ) + \u03b2 cos \u03c0\u03b1p(xp,q+1 + xp,q\u22121 ) = sxpq ,\nsin \u03c0\u03b1q(xp+1,q \u2212 xp\u22121,q ) \u2212 \u03b2 sin \u03c0\u03b1p(xp,q+1 \u2212 xp,q\u22121 ) = 0,\n\nZ\n\nfor all p, q\u01eb , except p = q = 0. We shall refer to the system (2.1) with the case\np = q = 0 exempted by (2.1)\u2217 .\nBefore we proceed with our objective, we are going to dwell a little on the linear\nsystem (2.1). First, if one multiplies the second equation by the imaginary\nunit i, and adds the result to the first equation, then one obtains Harper's\nequation on the two dimensional lattice, which is so common in physics, and\nthere are no algebraic complications attached to this equation. By contrast, the\nsystem (2.1) and its truncated version (2.1)\u2217 , combines two features which call\nfor a specifically designed approach to generate and analyze its solutions (see\n[R3]). On the one hand, the system is largely overdetermined, giving rise to\nredundancies: Asymptotically there are roughly twice as many equations than\nvariables. On the other hand, the system is degenerate along the diagonals p = q\nand p = \u2212q: A recursion involving 4\u00d74 matrices to generate the solutions of this\nsystem collapses as one tries to cross either one of those two axes. The tenet\nunderlying the proof of Proposition 1.3 is that these two features, reflecting\nintrinsic properties of the operator h(\u03b2), must also hold the key to its more\nelusive spectral properties. Generally speaking, for numbers s in the spectrum\nof h(\u03b2) the system (2.1) yields uniformly bounded solutions, which are obtained\nby evaluating certain states defined on the C \u2217 -algebra A\u03b1 at the standardized\n6\n\n\fmonomials wpq . (In [R1], where it was shown that the linear dimension of the\nspace of uniformly bounded solutions is always either equal to one or to two,\nthey were referred to as \"eigenstates\".) For s=z in the resolvent set of h(\u03b2),\nthe double sequence {cpq (z)} is always exponentially decaying as |p| \u2192 \u221e and\n|q| \u2192 \u221e. This is the crucial property we shall exploit in the proof. However, in\noder to take advantage of it, we first need to \"homogenize\" the double sequence.\nIn other words, we have to find a double sequence solving the homogeneous\nsystem (2.1), which preserves some measure of that exponential decay, but also\nshares the vanishing conditions that hail from a possible critical point for the\nfunction L. To this effect we need to delve a bit deeper into system (2.1)\u2217 .\nThe solutions to this system form a linear space of dimension 6. Up to a scaling\nfactor to be determined below, there are four solutions with the property that\neach of those has non-vanishing coefficients only in exactly one of the four sectors\nseparated by the lines p = q and p = \u2212q in the two dimensional lattice. The\ncomponents of these four solutions are nothing but the \"Fourier coefficients\" of\nthe resolvent of perturbations of h(\u03b2) which are obtained by multiplying the\ngenerators u and v with suitable complex numbers of modulus larger than one\nor less than one. Put in technical terms, expanding these resolvents in terms of\nthe standardized monomials wpq yields a \"non-commutative\" multiple Laurent\nseries whose coefficients are exactly those solutions. To assign a symbol to\n(1,0)\n(\u22121.0)\neach of the four solutions, let's say that Rpq (s) vanishes for p 6 0, Rpq\n(s)\n(0,1)\n(0,\u22121)\nvanishes for p \u2265 0, Rpq (s) vanishes for q \u2264 0, and Rpq\n(s) vanishes for\nq \u2265 0. All four of these solutions can be computed by means of a two component\nrecursion of the type (3.13) in [R3]. Since we assumed \u03b2 to be less than one, it\nfollows that R(1,0) (s) and R(\u22121,0) (s) decay exponentially of order \u03b2 along any\nline in the lattice with slope 1 or \u22121, and that R(0,1) (s) as well as R(0,\u22121) (s)\ngrow exponentially of order \u03b2 \u22121 along the four lines with slope 1 or \u22121 through\nthe points (0,1) or (0, \u22121) in exactly one direction. Taking the arithmetic mean\nof R(1,0) (z ) and R(\u22121,0) (z ), both suitably scaled, yields a solution {dpq (z)} of\n(2.1)\u2217 which has the following properties\n(2.2)\n\nZ\n\ndpq (z) = d|p||q| (z), for all p, q\u01eb ; d1,0 (z) =\n\n1\n; dpq (z) = 0 for |q| \u2265 |p| .\n2\n\n(2.3)\n\nZ\n\nlim \u03b2 \u2212|p| |dp,k+p (z)| < \u221e, lim \u03b2 \u2212|p| |dp,k\u2212p (z)| < \u221e, for all k\u01eb .\n\n|p|\u2192\u221e\n\n|p|\u2192\u221e\n\nReturning to our objective, it now follows that the double sequence \u03c6pq (z) =\ncpq (z) \u2212 dpq (z) solves the system (2.1) and has the following additional properties:\n(2.4)\n{\u03c6pq (z)} decays two \u2212 sided exponentially along any line in the lattice with slope 1 or \u22121\n7\n\n\f(2.5)\nIf c00 (z) = c01 (z) = 0, then \u03c6pq (z) = 0 for |p|, |q| \u2264 1\nWe are going to shelve this for a while, and turn to the discussion of a certain subalgebra of the C \u2217 -algebra A\u03b1 . For two elements a, b\u01ebA\u03b1 we denote by\nalg \u22c6 (a, b) the \u2217-algebra generated by a and b. Next we define two distinguished\nelements.\n\nU = \u03b2\u2212\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n\nu + \u03b2 2 v,\n\nV = w\u22121,1\n\nwhich satisfy the relations\n(2.6)\n\nUV = \u03bb\u22122 VU, U\u2217V = \u03bb2 VU\u2217, where \u03bb = e\u03c0\u03b1i.\n\nOne way to look at these two elements is that, while mimicking the generators\nfor the rotation algebra A\u03b1 , they also allow for the representation of the element\nh(\u03b2) in a form that resembles representing the degenerate element h(0) in terms\nof u and v ,\nh(\u03b2) = + \u2217 .\n\nU U\n\nUV\n\nThe next step is to complete the mimicry, rendering alg \u22c6 ( , ) as much as\npossible a look alike of alg \u22c6 (u, v). What's missing from the picture is a basic\nsymmetry, a conjugate linear involutive automorphism that assigns to one of the\ngenerators its adjoint, while fixing the other one. Such a symmetry is readily\navailable for alg \u22c6 (u, v),\n(2.7)\n\u03c3(u) = u\u2217 , \u03c3(v) = v.\nReversal of the roles of u and v leads to another symmetry, which is equivalent\nto the one just defined. But due to the asymmetric nature of the elements\nand , only one of them survives the mimicry. To obtain such a symmetry for\nalg \u22c6 ( , ), we first introduce an automorphism of A\u03b1 that appeared for the\nfirst time in [R4],\n\nU\n\nV\nUV\n\n(2.8)\n\u03c1\u03b2 (u) = vuv(uv + \u03b2)\u22121 (v \u2217 u\u2217 + \u03b2)\n\u03c1\u03b2 (v) = v(uv + \u03b2)\u22121 (v \u2217 u\u2217 + \u03b2).\nNotice that, due to the general properties of A\u03b1 , it is quite easy to define\nautomorphisms of A\u03b1 . All one has to do is to assign unitary elements in A\u03b1 to\nthe two generators which preserve the fundamental commutation relation (1.1).\nAny assignment of this kind extends automatically to an automorphism. Since\nit can be shown that is a generator for A\u03b1 , in other words the set of all (noncommutative) polynomials in and \u2217 is norm dense in A\u03b1 , the automorphism\n\u03c1\u03b2 is uniquely determined by the identity,\n\nU\n\nU\n\nU\n\n(2.9)\n\u03c1\u03b2 (u + \u03b2v) = u\u2217 + \u03b2v.\n8\n\n\fThus, composition of \u03c3 and \u03c1\u03b2 ,\n\u03c3\u03b2 = \u03c3 \u25e6 \u03c1\u03b2 ,\nyields a conjugate linear automorphism which is uniquely determined by the\nassignments\n(2.10)\n\u03c3\u03b2 (u) = vu\u2217 v(u\u2217 v + \u03b2)\u22121 (v \u2217 u + \u03b2),\n\u03c3\u03b2 (v) = v(u\u2217 v + \u03b2)\u22121 (v \u2217 u + \u03b2).\n\nU V) is exactly what we\n\nThe restriction of this symmetry to the algebra alg \u22c6 ( ,\nneed,\n(2.11)\n\nU\n\n\u03c3\u03b2 ( ) =\n\nU, \u03c3\u03b2 (V) = V\u22c6.\n\nWhile the first relation is obvious, the second one can be checked through\nstraightforward manipulations. Our next objective is to show that this symmetry, when evaluated at the standardized monomials, yields elements whose\nexpansion in the standardized monomials have desirable exponential decay properties. First we observe that\n(u\u2217 v + \u03b2)\u22121 =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(\u2212\u03b2)n (v \u2217 u)n+1 ,\n\nn=0\n\nand taking the adjoint on both sides yields of course a similar expansion. This\nshows that \u03c3\u03b2 (wpq ) is a product of v p+q and an element that has a power series\nexpansion in the monomial w1,\u22121 whose radius of convergence is equal to \u03b2 \u22121 .\nIn conclusion, we obtain the following representation,\n(2.12)\n\u03c3\u03b2 (wpq ) =\n\nX\n\nm\u01ebZ\n\n(p,q)\nrm\nwm,p+q\u2212m , where lim\n\n|m|\u2192\u221e\n\n(p,q)\n\n| rm\n\n1\n\n| |m| 6 \u03b2 .\n\nIn preparation for the proof of Proposition 1.3 in the next section we introduce\ntwo linear functional \u03c6z and \u03c6z \u2022 \u03c3\u03b2 which are defined for z\u01eb \\Sp(h(\u03b2)) on\nthe algebra alg \u2217 (u, v) by the assignments\n\nR\n\n\u03c6z (wpq ) = \u03c6pq (z),\n\u03c6z \u2022 \u03c3\u03b2 (wpq ) =\n\nX\n\nm\u01ebZ\n\n(p,q)\n\nrm\n\n\u03c6z (wm,p+q\u2212m )\n\nNotice that, by (2.4) and (2.12) the terms in the sum on the right-hand side of\nthe second formula decay exponentially of an order less than or equal to \u03b2. The\nsecond formula defines essentially the composition of the first functional with\n9\n\n\fthe symmetry \u03c3\u03b2 . Since \u03c3\u03b2 is conjugate linear, we have to conjugate the terms\nin the sum in order to render the resulting functional linear. We are now going\nto show that the two functionals are actually equal.\n(2.13)\n\u03c6z = \u03c6z \u2022 \u03c3\u03b2 .\nTo see this, we need to return briefly to the settings at the beginning of the\npresent section. First, since \u03c3\u03b2 (h(\u03b2)) = h(\u03b2), we also have \u03c3\u03b2 ((h(\u03b2) \u2212 z)\u22121 ) =\n(h(\u03b2) \u2212 z)\u22121 . Notice that, by our assumption, z is a real number. This means\nthat all we need to show is, that the functionals \u03b8z and \u03b8z \u2022\u03c3\u03b2 , which are defined\nbelow, are equal.\n(2.14)\n(1,0)\n\u03b8z (wpq ) = Rpq\n(z), \u03b8z \u2022 \u03c3\u03b2 (wpq ) =\n\nX\n\nm\u01ebZ\n\n(p,q)\n\nrm\n\n\u03b8z (wm,p+q\u2212m ).\n\nand that a similar statement holds for R(\u22121,0) (z). Again, since \u03c3\u03b2 (h(\u03b2)) = h(\u03b2),\nand since R(1,0) (z ) solves the system (2.1)\u2217 , the second functional solves the\nsystem (2.1)\u2217 as well. However, since by the representation in (2.12) and the\nvanishing properties of R(1,0) (z ), \u03b8z \u2022 \u03c3\u03b2 (wpq ) vanishes for all indices located\nbelow or on the the line p = \u2212q in the two dimensional lattice, the double\nsequence {\u03b8z \u2022 \u03c3\u03b2 (wpq )} must be a linear combination of R(1,0) (z ) and R(0,1) (z ).\nSince R(0,1) (z ) grows exponentially of order \u03b2 \u22121 along the two lines with slope\n(1,0)\n1 or\u22121 through the point (0, 1), while \u03b8z \u2022 \u03c3\u03b2 (wpq ) and Rpq (z ) vanish or\ndecay exponentially along these two lines, it follows that {\u03b8z \u2022 \u03c3\u03b2 (wpq )} is just\na scalar multiple of R(1,0) (z ). But since \u03c3\u03b2 is unital, the two double sequences\nmust actually be equal. A similar statement can now be obtained for R(\u22121,0) (z)\nalong a similar line of reasoning. This concludes our argument establishing the\nvalidity of (2.13).\n.\nSection 3\nWe turn now to the proof of Proposition 1.3. Henceforth we shall simply write \u03c6\nfor the functional \u03c6z introduced in section 2, because we shall assume that z is a\nfixed real number in the resolvent set of h(\u03b2). The idea of the proof is to exploit\nthe decay conditions of \u03c6(wpq ) along lines with slope \u22121in the two dimensional\nlattice, to construct a functional \u03c8 on alg \u22c6 (u, v), with the property that \u03c6 can\nbe recovered from \u03c8 by the identity \u03c8(a ) = \u03c6(a) for all a\u01ebalg \u22c6 (u, v), and then\nshowing that such a functional can not exist, in case the function L in section\n1has a critical point. Of course, there are infinitely many functionals with this\nproperty. One simply has to implement a separate elementary recursion along\nevery single line with slope \u22121. The crux is to impose constraints which\nrestrict the availability of such functionals severely. More specifically, we shall\nprove the following.\n\nU\n\n10\n\n\f3.1 Lemma There exists a linear functional \u03c8 on alg \u22c6 (u, v), having the properties,\n(i)\u2200a\u01ebalg \u22c6 (u, v) : \u03c8(a ) = \u03c6(a).\n(ii)\u2200p\u01eb\n\nN0, \u2200q\u01ebZ : \u03c8(U V ) = \u03c8(U V\n\nU\n\nU\u2217 )pVq ) = \u03c8((U\u2217)p V\u2212q ).\n(iii)\u2200a\u01ebalg \u22c6 (u, v) : \u03c8((h(\u03b2) \u2212 z)a) = \u03c8(a(h(\u03b2) \u2212 z)U) = 0.\np\n\nq\n\np\n\n\u2212q ), \u03c8((\n\nProof: First we extend slightly the settings of Section 2. Let B be the set of\nelements a in A\u03b1 which can be written in the form\n(3.1)\na=\n\nN\nX\nX\n\nn=\u2212N m\u01ebZ\n\nkm,n\u2212m wm,n\u2212m , where\n\nlim\n\n|m|\u2212\u2192\u221e\n\n|km,n\u2212m |\n\n1\n|m|\n\n< \u221e for \u2212N \u2264 n \u2264 N.\n\nThis set is an involutive subalgebra of A\u03b1 . Also, (2.12) implies\n(3.2)\n\u03c3\u03b2 (B) = B.\nFurthermore,\n\nU\u22121 = \u03b2 \u2212\n\n1\n2\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(\u2212\u03b2)n (u\u2217 v)n u\u2217 \u01ebB.\n\nn=0\n\nNow (2.3) allows us to extend the definition of the functional \u03c6 to elements of\nthe form (3.1) as follows,\n\u03c6(a) =\n\nN\nX\nX\n\nn=\u2212N m\u01ebZ\n\nkm,n\u2212m \u03c6(wm,n\u2212m ).\n\nObviously, this extended functional is also linear. Moreover, by (2.13)\n(3.3)\n\u03c6(\u03c3\u03b2 (a)) = \u03c6(a), a\u01ebB,\nand since the double sequence {\u03c6pq (z)} in Section 2 solves the system (2.1),\n(3.4)\n\u03c6((h(\u03b2) \u2212 z)a) = \u03c6(a(h(\u03b2) \u2212 z)) = 0, a\u01ebB.\nWe are now going to define the functional \u03c8 as follows,\n\u03c8(a) = \u03c6(a\n\nU\u22121 ), a\u01ebB.\n\nWe need to check that \u03c8 has the claimed properties. By construction this is\nobvious for (i). Next, if p is a non-negative integer, and q is an arbitrary integer,\nthen (2.11) and (3.3) yield,\n\nUpVq ) = \u03c6(Up Vq U\u22121) = \u03c6(\u03c3\u03b2 (Up Vq U\u22121)) = \u03c6(Up V\u2212q U\u22121) = \u03c8(UpV\u2212q ),\n\n\u03c8(\n\n11\n\n\fwhich establishes the first identity in (ii).

This is true because the double sequence {cpq (z)} decays exponentially\nas |p| \u2192 \u221e and |q| \u2192 \u221e, while this is not true for {dpq (z)}. If {dpq (z)} were\ndecaying exponentially as |p| \u2192 \u221e and |q| \u2192 \u221e, then the two solutions R1,0 (z )\nand R\u22121,0 (z ) of the system (2.1)\u2217 would give rise to two distinct inverses of the\nsame element h(\u03b2) \u2212 z, which is of course impossible. Now suppose that\n(\u03c4 ((h(\u03b2) \u2212 z)\u22121 ) = \u03c4 ((h(\u03b2) \u2212 z)\u22121 v)) = 0.\nIt follows from (2.5),\n\u03c6(u) = \u03c6(u\u2217 ) = \u03c6(v) = \u03c6(v \u2217 ) = 0\nSince the double sequence {\u03c6(wpq )} solves the system (2.1), this implies that \u03c6\nis non-zero if and only if\n\u03c6( ) 6= 0.\n\nV\n\nThe vanishing conditions for \u03c6 translate into several vanishing conditions for \u03c8.\nFirst, by Lemma 2.1,\n\u03c8( ) = \u03c6( ) = 0.\n\nU\n\ne\n\nFurthermore,\n1\n\ne\n\nU\n\n1\n\n\u03b2 \u2212 2 \u03c8( ) + \u03b2 2 \u03c8(u\u2217 v) = \u03c8(u\u2217 ) = \u03c6(u\u2217 ) = 0,\n15\n\n\f1\n\ne\n\n1\n\nU\n\n\u03b2 \u2212 2 \u03c8(v \u2217 u) + \u03b2 2 \u03c8( ) = \u03c8(v \u2217 ) = \u03c6(v \u2217 ) = 0,\nor, equivalently,\n\ne\n\n1\n\n1\n\nV\u2217 ) = 0,\n\u03c8(e) = 0.\n\n\u03b2 \u2212 2 \u03c8( ) + \u03b2 2 \u03bb\u22121 \u03c8(\n\nV\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\u03b2 \u2212 2 \u03bb\u03c8( ) + \u03b2 2\nBy Lemma 2.1(ii),\n\ne\n\ne\n\nV\u2217 ) = \u03c8(V).\nThis yields a linear system for \u03c8(e) and \u03c8(V),\n\u03b2 \u2212 \u03c8(e) + \u03b2 \u03bb\u03c8(V ) = 0,\n\u03b2 \u03c8(e) + \u03b2 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c8(V) = 0.\n\u03c8( ) = \u03c8( ), \u03c8(\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\nSince the determinant of this system,\n1\n\n\u03b2\u2212 2\n1\n\u03b22\n\n1\n\n\u03b22\u03bb\n1\n\u03b2\u2212 2 \u03bb\n\n= \u03bb(\u03b2 \u22121 \u2212 \u03b2)\n\nis non-zero for \u03b2 6= 1, it follows that\n\ne\n\nV\nV\u2217) = 0.\nFinally, by Lemma 3.1(iii), since \u03c8(e) = 0, and \u03c8(U) = \u03c6(e) = 0\n\u03c8(U\u2217 ) = \u03c8(U + U\u2217 \u2212 z e) = 0.\n\u03c8( ) = \u03c8( ) = \u03c8(\n\nUV\n\nIn conclusion we have shown, that \u03c8 (more precisely its restriction to alg \u22c6 ( , ))\n1\nsatisfies the conditions (i) and (ii) of Lemma 2.2, letting t = z\u03b2 \u2212 2 .
