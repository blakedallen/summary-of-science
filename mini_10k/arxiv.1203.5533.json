Each site of\nthe graph can be either occupied or vacant. A vacant site becomes occupied with rate 1. A\nsite is ignited with rate \u03bb, and its whole occupied cluster burns instantaneously.\nThe purpose of this paper is to show the existence of a stationary distribution for forestd\nfire processes on Zd , for d \u2265 2. We define a distribution on {0, 1}Z as a limit of a sequence of\ninvariant distributions of finite volume forest-fire processes, and then show it is a stationary\ndistribution for forest-fire processes on Zd , d \u2265 2.\n\nIntroduction\nForest-fire models have been introduced within the study of self-organised criticality ([1]).\nThe idea behind self-organised criticality is the evolution of the system toward a critical\nbehavior, only driven by its own interaction rules (see [10] for example). In the nineties, a\nforest-fire model in discrete time and on a finite graph, introduced by Drossel and Schwabl\n[6], has been studied in the physics literature. In 2005 in [2] van den Berg and Jarai\nstudied the asymptotic behavior of a continuous-time version of the Drossel-Schwabl forestfire model, on an infinite graph : Z. Then this model has been studied on Z, on Zd and on\nconnected graphs with a vertex degree bounded by d, for d \u2265 2.\nLet G = (V, E) be a connected graph with vertex degree bounded by d \u2265 2. V is the set\nof vertices and E the set of edges of the graph. In the model, each site of V can be vacant\nor occupied by a tree. Two sites of V are neighbors if they are linked by an edge in E.\nThe evolution is driven by the initial configuration and two families of Poisson processes,\none governing the birth of trees and the other the ignition of a site. Throughout this paper\n\"birth\" of a tree and \"growth\" of a tree have the same meaning. An empty site becomes\noccupied if and only if there is a birth attempt. An occupied site becomes empty either if\nthe site is ignited or if a site of its connected cluster of occupied sites is ignited. The second\ncase models the propagation of fire. As the burning is instantaneous here, the speed of the\nfire propagation is infinite.\nMore precisely, the configuration at time t of the forest is the process ((\u03b7t,x )x\u2208V )t\u22650 where\n\u03b7t,x takes the value 1 if the site x is occupied at time t and 0 otherwise. If the site x is\noccupied at time t, its connected cluster Ct,x is the set of all occupied sites connected to x\nby a path of occupied sites.\nDefinition 1. (open path and connected cluster of a site)\n1. A path between 2 sites x and y in V is a set of sites {zi }1\u2264i\u2264n of V such that z1 = x,\nzn = y and for all integers i \u2208 {1, . . . , n \u2212 1} there is an edge of E linking zi and zi+1 .\nThe path is open at time t if all its sites are occupied at time t.\n2. The connected cluster Ct,x of a site x at time t is the set of all sites of V linked to x\nwith an open path.\n\n\fTo each site x \u2208 V are associated two Poisson processes, (Gt,x )t\u22650 and (It,x )t\u22650 , with\nintensity 1 and \u03bb > 0 respectively. The process Gx represents the birth attempts on the site x\nwhereas Ix represents ignition attempts on the site x. These two processes are independent\nand moreover independent of each Poisson process of all the other sites. The following\ndefinition gives a rigourous definition of the forest-fire process.\nDefinition 2. Let S be a subset of V and \u03bb a non negative real number. A forest-fire process\non S with parameter \u03bb > 0 is a process (\u03b7 t )t\u22650 where \u03b7 t = (\u03b7 t,x )x\u2208S = (\u03b7t,x , Gt,x , It,x )x\u2208S ,\nwith values in ({0, 1} \u00d7 N \u00d7 N)S , that has the following properties.\n1. For all sites x in S, the processes (Gt,x )t\u22650 and (It,x )t\u22650 , are independent Poisson\nprocesses with parameter 1 and \u03bb respectively.\n2. For all sites x in S, the process (\u03b7t,x , Gt,x , It,x )t\u22650 is right continous and left limited.\n3. For all x \u2208 S and all t \u2265 0,\n(a) if there is a growth of a tree at the site x at time t, then the site x is occupied at\ntime t,\nGt\u2212 ,x < Gt,x \u21d2 \u03b7t,x = 1,\n(b) if the site x becomes occupied at time t, then a tree must have grown at the site\nx at time t\n\u03b7t\u2212 ,x < \u03b7t,x \u21d2 Gt\u2212 ,x < Gt,x ,\n(c) if the site x is ignited at time t, then all the sites of its connected cluster get\nvacant at time t,\nIt\u2212 ,x < It,x \u21d2 \u2200y \u2208 Ct\u2212 ,x , \u03b7t,y = 0,\n(d) if the site x gets vacant at time t, then the connected cluster of the site x has\nbeen ignited at time t,\n\u03b7t\u2212 ,x > \u03b7t,x \u21d2 \u2203y \u2208 Ct\u2212 ,x : It\u2212 ,y < It,y .\nThe notation \u03b7(t) will be used to denote the configuration at time t : {\u03b7t,x }x\u2208S .\nOn a finite graph, the forest-fire process is uniquely determined by the following contruction. At time zero, the initial configuration of the forest is given. Then, the evolution\nis governed by the Poisson processes. Due to the finite number of sites, all the Poissonian\nevents can be ordered in time. Then, four situations can occur. Imagine that there is a\ngrowth attempt on the site x. If the site x is vacant, then it becomes occupied. But if x\nis already occupied, nothing happens. Imagine now that there is an ignition attempt on\nthe site y. If the site y is vacant, nothing happens. But if y is occupied, then its whole\nconnected cluster burns down immediately. At each Poissonian event, the configuration is\nupdated using these rules.\nHowever on an infinite graph, infinitely many Poissonian events can occur in a finite\ninterval of time. Thus the construction given above does not work anymore. Does this\nforest-fire process exist on infinite graphs? The answer is yes. It can easily be seen on Z\nusing a graphical construction ([11]) but it is harder on Zd for d \u2265 2. On Z, if an initial\nconfiguration has infinitely many empty sites, then at a time t > 0 there are almost surely\ninfinitely many empty sites that have been empty during the whole interval of time [0, t]. An\nempty site blocks the propagation of fire on Z. So, Z can be divided into finite pieces and the\n\n\fprevious construction can be used on each piece. But on Zd for d \u2265 2, an empty site alone\ncannot block fires. By using a sequence of finite-volume processes and finding a control\nof the influence of the state of long-distance sites, D\u00fcrre has shown in [7] the existence\nof forest-fire processes on Zd for all initial configurations that contain no infinite clusters.\nThis result can be extended to connected graphs with vertex degree bounded by d \u2265 2.\nHowever, nothing ensures that given an initial configuration and all the Poisson processes,\nthe forest-fire process is unique. This uniquenesss result is proven for all parameter \u03bb > 0 in\n[9], with an assumption on the size of the clusters in the initial configuration. The question\nof uniqueness for all initial configurations is still open.\nIn this paper, we will be interested in stationary distributions of the forest-fire process.\nThe forest-fire process is a Markov process but not a Feller process. Thus the usual arguments used with interacting particles systems will not work here (see for example [11]).\nBrouwer and Pennanen have shown in [5] the existence of at least one stationary distribution for the process on Z. In [3] Bressaud and Fournier have shown that the stationary\ndistribution is unique when the parameter \u03bb is equal to 1.\nThe purpose of this note is to prove the existence of a stationary distribution for\nforest-fire processes on Zd with d larger than 2. The method of Brouwer and Pennanen\ncombined with some tools introduced by D\u00fcrre in his thesis [9] will be used. Since the\nexistence of forest-fire processes on Zd is known yet for initial configurations that contain\nno infinite clusters, we will consider only such forest-fire processes in this paper.\nTheorem 1. A forest-fire process on Zd with d \u2265 2, with parameter \u03bb > 0 has at least one\nstationary translation-invariant distribution.\nThis paper is divided into three parts. The first section presents the main notations and\nthe tools introduced by D\u00fcrre in [9] that will be used in this paper. Then, the construction\nof the candidate for the stationary distribution is explained in the second part. Finally the\nlast section is devoted to the proof of Theorem 1.\n\n1\n\nNotations and tools\n\nThe purpose of this section is to present the main notations and the tools introduced by\nD\u00fcrre in [9].\n\n1.1\n\nNotations\n\nUnless stated otherwise, in this section, G will denote a connected graph with a vertices set\nV and an edges set E. A bound on the vertex degree of the graph G will be denoted by dG .\nd\n\nFor x = (x1 , . . . , xd ) \u2208 Z , |x|\u221e = sup {|xi |, i = 1 . . . d} and |x|1 =\n\nd\nX\n\n|xi |.\n\ni=1\n\nThe expression the graph Zd will refer to a graph with\bvertices set V (d) = Zd and edges\nset E (d) corresponding to the hypercubic lattice : E (d) = {x, y} \u2208 Zd \u00d7 Zd : |x \u2212 y|1 = 1 .\nThe site (0, . . . , 0) \u2208 Zd will be called the origin. We will work with specifc finite subsets\nof Zd called boxes, and defined by\nBk = {x \u2208 Zd : |x|\u221e \u2264 k}.\nHere k is called the radius of the box Bk .\n\n\fThe set of neighbors of a finite set of sites S is called the boundary of S :\nN (S) = {x \u2208 V \\ S, \u2203 y \u2208 S linked by an edge in E to x}.\nWe can define the set S = S \u222a N (S).\nd\n\nLet X = {0, 1}Z be the set of all possible configuations and B(X) the associated borel\n\u03c3-field. Let \u03bc be a measure on (X, B(X)). For a finite subset J of Zd we denote by \u03bc|J the\nrestriction of \u03bc to J. For a forest-fire process \u03b7 with an initial configuration with law \u03bc, let\nus denote by P \u03bc (\u03b7t \u2208 *) its distribution at time t.\n\n1.2\n\nD\u00fcrre's tools\n\nIn this model, the problem is to control the influence of long-distance sites. Two notions\nintroduced by D\u00fcrre in his thesis will be used in this paper. The first one is a condition\non the tail of the distribution of cluster size, named CCSB. The second one is a process,\ncalled the blur-process, used to study the influence on a given site of long-distant sites.\nThroughout this section, forest-fire processes on connected graphs will be considered.\n1.2.1\n\nCCSB condition\n\nAn important quantity to consider here is the size of clusters. In his thesis, D\u00fcrre restricted\nto forest-fire processes with initial configurations satisfying what he called the conditionned\ncluster size bound condition to prove the uniqueness. In order to use his results, we will\nneed to use this conditionned cluster size bound condition.\nThis condition is a constraint on the cluster size distribution. It implies a uniform bound\non the cluster size distribution. It is stronger in the sense that the result still holds when\nconditionning by the event that a specific configuration of a finite number of sites outside\nthe cluster occurs.\nDefinition 3. (Conditionned cluster size bound, CCSB) For all s \u2265 0, \u03b4 \u2265 0 and m \u2208 N, \u03b7\nhas CCSB(s, \u03b4, m) if it has the following property. Let B an D be two finite subsets of V and\nx \u2208 V \\ D. Then conditionned on the occurence of the event \u222ay\u2208B Cs,y = D, the probability\nthat the size of the cluster at x is larger than m at time s is smaller than or equal to \u03b4. And\nalmost surely the cluster at x is finite at time s.\nMore formally, for all finite B, D \u2282 V , for all x \u2208 V \\ D,\n\\\b [\n[\n\b\n\u0001\n\u0001\nP |Cs,x | > m\nCs,y = D \u2264 \u03b4 P\nCs,y = D\n(1)\ny\u2208B\n\n\u0001\nand P |Cs,x | = \u221e = 0.\n\ny\u2208B\n\n(2)\n\nFor example, consider a configuration where the size of all the clusters is smaller than\nan integer m, or a configuration obtained by sub-critical or critical site percolation on Zd .\nThen, a forest-fire process with one of these initial configurations satisfy a CCSB(0, \u03b4, m)\ncondition.\nA natural question to ask is whether a forest-fire process satisfies a CCSB condition. If\nthe forest-fire process has a CCSB at time 0, then the following theorem states that after a\ncertain time the answer is yes. The uniformity in time and in \u03b4 will be useful in the proof\nof the result.\n\n\fTheorem 2. (Theorem 2 in [9]) Consider a forest-fire process \u03b7\u0304 on G with parameter \u03bb >\n0 that satisfies CCSB(0, 4d\u03bb2 , m) for some integer m. Then for all real number \u03b3 > 0,\nG\nfor all \u03b4 \u2208]0, 1], there exists an integer m\u03b3,\u03bb,dG (\u03b4) such that for all time s \u2265 \u03b3, \u03b7\u0304 has\nCCSB(s, \u03b4, m\u03b3,\u03bb,dG (\u03b4)).\nIn [9] an explicit formula for the parameter m\u03b3,\u03bb,dG (\u03b4) appearing in the CCSB condition\nis given.\n1.2.2\n\nBlur process\n\nWe turn now to the blur-process. The aim of this process is to control the influence of\nlong-distant sites on a given site. This process is associated with a forest-fire process \u03b7\u0304, and\ndefined from an initial time t0 and a finite set S. The blur process indicates if the state\nof a site x \u2208 S\u0304 at time t \u2265 t0 might be influenced by the state of the sites located outside\nthe set S at time t0 . If it might, the site is said to be (t0 , S)-blurred at time t. The word\n\"might\" is important here. It means that the blur-process is a domination of the process of\nthe real influence from outside S. If the site x is not (t0 , S)-blurred at time t, its state at\ntime t can be recovered by using only the configuration at time t0 and the Poisson processes\nof the sites in the set S.\nThe value of the (t0 , S)-blur process at a site x \u2208 S\u0304 at a time t is either 2 if the site is\nblurred or 0 otherwise. Once a site is blurred, it is blurred forever. The set of blurred sites\nat t0 is N (S) and the clusters in \u03b7(t0 ) intersecting the boundary of S. As time evolves, this\nset grows toward the site x, due to births of trees that create new occupied paths. Here is\nthe formal definition of the blur process.\nDefinition 4. (blur process) Let t0 \u2265 0 and S \u2282 V a finite subset. The (t0 , S)-blur process\n(\u03b2s,x )s\u2265t0 ,x\u2208S is a process with values in {0, 2}S , right continuous that has the following\nproperties. For all site x in S,\n\u2022 the site x is (t0 , S)-blurred at time t0 if and only if its cluster is connected to the\nboundary of S :\n\u001a\n2 if C s,x \u2229 N (S) 6= \u2205\n\u03b2t0 ,x =\n0 else,\n\u2022 once a site is (t0 , S)-blurred, it remains (t0 , S)-blurred forever :\nif \u03b2s,x = 2, then \u2200s0 \u2265 s, \u03b2s0 ,x = 2,\n\u2022 the site x is (t0 , S)-blurred at time s > t0 if and only if the set C s,x contains a site\nthat has been (t0 , S)-blurred before time s :\n\b\n{\u03b2s,x = 2} = \u2203z \u2208 C s,x \u2229 S : \u03b2s\u2212 ,z = 2 .\nLike for the configuration process, the notation \u03b2(t) will be used for {\u03b2t,x }x\u2208Zd .\nIt seems that the bigger the set S is, the longer it takes for the site x to be S-blurred.\nWhat happens when the size of the set S tends to infinity? Is there a non empty interval\nduring which a site is not influenced by \"infinity\"? The answer is given by the following\nproposition, assuming a CCSB condition is satisfied by the forest-fire process.\n\n\fProposition 3. (Proposition 2 in [9]) For all m \u2208 N, there exists \u000fm > 0 with the following\nproperty. Let t \u2265 0 and suppose that the forest-fire process has CCSB(t, 4d\u03bb2 , m). Then for\nG\nall sites x in V , as n tends to infinity, the probability that the site x is (t, Bn )-blurred at\ntime t + \u000fm tends to zero :\nlim P (\u03b2t+\u000fm ,x = 2) = 0.\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n1\nRemark. The real number \u000fm > 0 is chosen such that P (G0,\u000fm > 0) < 4md\n, where G0,\u000fm\nG\nis the event that there is at least an occurrence in [0, \u000fm ] of a Poisson process with intensity\n1.\n\nRemark. This proposition is slightly different from the one written in [9]. The additionnal\nhypothesis of almost-sure convergence at time t is omitted here. Actually D\u00fcrre has shown\nthat it is always satisfied for a forest-fire process having a CCSB condition at time zero.\n\n2\n\nA candidate distribution\n\nTo prove the existence of a stationary distribution, we exhibit a distribution and then show\nthat it is stationary. The aim of this section is to explain how the candidate distribution is\nobtained. The idea is to use forest-fire processes on finite graphs. To get the translationinvariance property of the stationary distribution, a modified version of the boxes Bk will\nbe used.\n\n2.1\n\nDefinition of \"finite volume\" forest-fire processes\n\nLet k be a non negative integer.\nThe first step is to define a graph. Contrary to what was mentionned above, the graph\ndefined below is infinite. The fact that the process defined on it will behave like a finitevolume forest-fire explains why it is called \"finite volume\".\nDefine a graph Gk = (V (d) , Ek ). The set of sites is V (d) = Zd . The set of edges Ek\nis bigger than the set of edges of the graph Zd . Some edges constructed from the box Bk\ndefined in Section 1.1 will be added. The goal is to make opposite sites of the interior\nboundary of Bk neighbors.\nRecall that E (d) is the set of edges corresponding to the hypercubic lattice of Zd (see\nSection 1.1).\nDefine now the additionnal set of edges Ak . For all indices j in {1, . . . , d}, consider a\nsite with the j-th coordinate equal to k and the other coordinates in the set {\u2212k, . . . , k}. It\nis an interior boundary point. Then consider the opposite boundary site, i.e. the site with\nits j-th coordinate equal to \u2212k and the other coordinates exactly the same as the first site.\nThen Ak consists in the edges between such pair of points for the whole interior boundary\nof Bk . More formally, for each j \u2208 {1, . . . , d} the edges between the following couples of\nsites are in Ak :\n\n\b\n(i1 , . . . , ij , . . . , id ); (i1 , . . . , \u2212ij , . . . , id ) with\n\n\u001a\n\nil = k if l = j\nil \u2208 {\u2212k, . . . , k} if l 6= j.\n\nThen the set Ek is the union of the sets E (d) and Ak .\n\n\fFigure 1: Exemple of additional edges for the graph G2\nIn Figure 1, a part of the additional edges for the graph G2 restricted to the box B2 \u2282 Z2\nare drawn.\nCompared to the graph Zd , at most d edges to each interior boundary site of Bk is added\nin the graph Gk . So the vertex degree of Gk is uniformly bounded by df = 3d, instead of\n2d for Zd . Let us denote df = 3d this bound.\nThe extra edges are not necessary to prove the existence of a stationnary distribution\nbut there are used to prove that the stationnary distribution is translation-invariant.\nNow the graph is defined, the second step is to consider a particular forest-fire process\non this graph.\nDefinition 5. A Gk -forest-fire process \u03b7\u0304 k with parameter \u03bb > 0 is a forest-fire process on\nthe graph Gk with parameter \u03bb > 0 with all the sites outside Bk always empty : for all times\nk\nt \u2265 0, for all sites x \u2208 Bkc , \u03b7t,x\n= 0.\nThis forest-fire process behaves like a forest-fire process on Bk where the opposite sites\nof the interior boundary are neighbors. The dynamic does not take into account the Poisson\nprocesses corresponding to the sites located outside Bk . However, its configurations take\nd\nvalues in {0, 1}Z . The Gk -forest-fire process can be seen as a forest-fire process on a discrete\ntorus of dimension d.\n\n2.2\n\nConstruction of the candidate measure\n\nFor each non negative integer k, let \u03b7\u0304 k be a Gk -forest-fire process. The configuration process\n\u03b7 k is a finite state-space Markov chain. Consider two possible states of this Markov chain \u03be1\nand \u03be2 and study the probability that the state \u03be1 leads to \u03be2 . Consider the following event:\nall the occupied sites in \u03be1 are ignited and then a tree grows on each site which is occupied\nin \u03be2 . As the growths and ignitions are driven by independent Poisson processes, this event\noccurs with a non negative probability. Therefore, this Markov chain is irreducible, recurrent\nand aperiodic. Thus it has a unique invariant distribution, which will be denoted by \u03bck .\nd\nSince the space {0, 1}Z is compact, the sequence (\u03bck )k\u22650 has a weakly convergent\nsubsequence. Let \u03bc be its limit and K the set of indices of the subsequence.\nTheorem 4. Let \u03b7 be a forest-fire process on Zd with parameter \u03bb > 0. Then \u03bc is an\ninvariant and translation-invariant probability measure for \u03b7.\n\n\fAs mentionned above, the Gk -forest-fire process behaves exactly as a forest-fire process\non a discrete torus. Thus each distribution \u03bck can be seen as a measure on a discrete\ntorus, where we have the rotation-invariance property. Here a translation on the graph\nGk corresponds to a rotation on the discrete torus with (2k + 1)d points, due to the Gk forest-fire process behavior. It follows that the weak limit \u03bc is translation-invariant.\n\n3\n\nProof of the result\n\nThe goal of this section is to prove Theorem 1. It follows from Theorem 4 stated above. This\nsection is divided in three parts. The first part contains the proof of Theorem 4 assuming\ntwo lemma. The lemma are then proved in the second and third part.\n\n3.1\n\nProof of Theorem 4\n\nTo show that the distribution \u03bc is stationary, the idea is to couple a forest-fire process\nwith initial configuration with law \u03bc with Gk -forest-fire processes with initial configuration\nwith law \u03bck using the same Poisson processes. Then, the evolution of the processes will be\ncompared using D\u00fcrre's tools.\nA diagram of the main steps of the proof is given at the end of this first subsection.\nLet \u03bb and \u03b3 be two non negative real numbers.\nFor simplification, as \u03bb and df are fixed here, let us denote by m\u03b3 the real m\u03b3,\u03bb,df ( 4 \u03bbd2 )\nf\n\nof Theorem 2 (recall that df = 3d, see Section 2.1).\nLet \u000f > 0 be a real number such that P (G0,\u000f > 0) <\n\n1\n,\n4m\u03b3 d2f\n\nwhere G0,\u000f is the event that\n\nthere is at least an occurrence in [0, \u000f] of a Poisson process with intensity 1.\nThe aim is to prove the following : for all times t < \u000f, for all cylinder events A,\nP \u03bc (\u03b7(t) \u2208 A) = \u03bc(A).\n\n(3)\n\nLet t be a non negative real number such that t < \u000f, and let A be a cylinder event.\nThroughout this proof, two specific sets of sites will be used.\nSince A is a cylinder event, it is determined by the configuration on a finite number of\nsites. Let I be the smallest box centered at the origin such that the event A can be described\nusing only sites in I. There exists rI such that I = BrI .\nWe will need to work with a set containing I but contained in Bk . Let L be a non\nnegative integer and J be the box BrI +L . In order to simplify the notation, we will not\nwrite the dependence of J on L.\n\nFigure 2: Sets of sites\n\n\fFor the remainder of the proof, only integers k \u2208 K satisfying the relation k > rI + L\nwill be considered.\nUsing the construction of the candidate measure \u03bc, a first upper bound is obtained :\n|P \u03bc (\u03b7(t) \u2208 A) \u2212 \u03bc(A)| \u2264 |P \u03bc (\u03b7(t) \u2208 A) \u2212 \u03bck (A)| + |\u03bck (A) \u2212 \u03bc(A)|.\n\n(4)\n\nk\n\nSince \u03bc is an invariant distribution for a Gk -forest-fire process, the equality (3) is satk\nisfied for \u03bck . Turn now to study of the difference |P \u03bc (\u03b7(t) \u2208 A) \u2212 P \u03bc (\u03b7 k (t) \u2208 A)|.\nConsider a forest-fire process on Zd and a Gk -forest-fire process, driven by the same\nPoisson processes on each site, and with initial configurations which coincide on J. Is it\npossible to find a time t when the two configurations on a site x in I are not the same? The\nanswer is yes if (and only if) the configuration outside the box J influences the configuration\nin the box I during the time interval [0, t] (through some fires outside J). Which events can\nallow influence on I from outside J? If at a time t0 in [0, t] there exists a path of occupied\nsites linking a site in I to a site outside J, then a lightning falling in J c can burn trees in I.\nThat means, using the blur process, the existence of a site in the set I that is (t, J)-blurred.\nHowever, in the difference we are interested in, the initial configuration of the two processes have the respective distribution \u03bc and \u03bck . In order to use our previous argument, we\nare going to optimally couple the measures \u03bc|J and \u03bck|J . The coupling of \u03bc|J and \u03bck|J is said\nto be optimal here if it maximizes the weight of the diagonal of the product of the spaces\nof configurations. For two configurations \u03be1 with law \u03bc|J and \u03be2 with law \u03bck|J , the optimal\ncoupling \u03bd satisfies \u03bd(\u03be1 6= \u03be2 ) = inf \u03c0(\u03be1 6= \u03be2 ), where M is the set of all possible couplings\n\u03c0\u2208M\n\nof \u03bc|J and \u03bck|J .\nNow we couple a forest-fire process \u03b7\u0304 on Zd with an initial configuration of law \u03bc and the\nGk -forest-fire process \u03b7\u0304 k with an initial configuration of law \u03bck , by using the same Poisson\nprocesses and by optimally coupling \u03bc|J and \u03bck|J . Then the following bound is obtained.\nLemma 5. Let us denote by \u03b2 the (0, J)-blur process associated with \u03b7. Then,\nk\n\n|P \u03bc (\u03b7(t) \u2208 A) \u2212 P \u03bc (\u03b7 k (t) \u2208 A)| \u2264 |I| sup P \u03bc (\u03b2t,x = 2) + 2 dT V (\u03bc|J , \u03bck|J ).\n\n(5)\n\nx\u2208I\n\nThis lemma will be proved in the following section. The idea of the proof is to use the\nevent \"the initial configurations of the two processes coincide on J\". When it occurs, an\nupper bound is found using the blur process. Otherwise, the upper bound is given by the\ntotal variation between the two measures \u03bc|J and \u03bck|J .\nUsing this lemma, the upper bound of the desired quantity is :\n|P \u03bc (\u03b7(t) \u2208 A) \u2212 \u03bc(A)| \u2264 |I| sup P \u03bc (\u03b2t,x = 2) + 2 dT V (\u03bc|J , \u03bck|J ) + |\u03bck (A) \u2212 \u03bc(A)|.\n\n(6)\n\nx\u2208I\n\nThe next step is to show that the upper bound of (6) tends to zero when k and L tend\nto infinity.\nThe distribution \u03bc is the weak limit of a subsequence of (\u03bck )k\u22650 . We first let k go to\ninfinity along the set of indices K. Since k > radius(J) = rI + L, L does not depend on k\nand J is a finite set of sites, so :\nlim |\u03bck (A) \u2212 \u03bc(A)| = 0\n\n(7)\n\nlim dT V (\u03bc|J , \u03bck|J ) = 0.\n\n(8)\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\n\fRecall that \u03b2 is a (0, J)-blur process. So the event {\u03b2t,x = 2} depends on L. To conclude\nwe need to show that lim P \u03bc (\u03b2t,x = 2) = 0. This is given by Proposition 3 applied with\nL\u2192\u221e\n\nt = 0 and \u03b4 = 4d\u03bb2 , provided the CCSB condition is satisfied. The purpose of the following\nf\nlemma is to show that this hypothesis holds true.\nLemma 6. For all non negative real number \u03b4, a forest-fire process on Zd with parameter\n\u03bb > 0, with an initial configuration with distribution \u03bc, has CCSB(0, \u03b4, m\u03b3,\u03bb,df (\u03b4)).\nRemark. In the last parameter of the CCSB condition, the bound used for the vertex degree\nof Zd is df = 3d and not 2d which is the optimal bound. This is due to our argument to\nprove this lemma, which uses the Gk -forest-fire process. Nevertheless this is sufficient here\nto show our theorem.\n\u03bb\n, we claim that a\n4d2f\nCCSB(0, 4d\u03bb2 , m\u03b3,\u03bb,df ( 4d\u03bb2 )).\nf\nf\n\nUsing Lemma 6 with \u03b4 =\nration with law \u03bc has\n\nforest-fire process with an initial configu-\n\nBy Proposition 3, there exists \u000fm\u03b3 such that for all site x in Zd , as L tends to infinity,\nthe probability that the site x is (0, J)-blurred at time \u000fm\u03b3 tends to zero. That is to say,\nwith the choice of \u000f made here, that for all t < \u000f, for all x \u2208 Zd lim P \u03bc (\u03b2t,x = 2) = 0.\nL\u2192\u221e\n\nSince |I| < \u221e, this concludes the proof.\nWe conclude this part with a diagram of the main steps of the proof.\ngoal : \u2200t < \u000f, |P \u03bc (\u03b7(t) \u2208 A) \u2212 \u03bc(A)| = 0\nuse of the subsequence of {\u03bck }k\n|P \u03bc (\u03b7(t) \u2208 A) \u2212 \u03bc(A)| \u2264 |P \u03bc (\u03b7(t) \u2208 A) \u2212 \u03bck (A)| +|\u03bck (A) \u2212 \u03bc(A)|\n|\n{z\n}\nLemma 5 : coupling and influence of sites of J c\nbound : |I| sup P \u03bc (x is (0, J)-blurred at t) +2 dT V (\u03bc|J , \u03bck|J ) + |\u03bck (A) \u2212 \u03bc(A)|\n{z\n}\n{z\n} |\n|\nx\u2208I\n|\n{z\n}\nweak convergence\n\nProposition 3 and Lemma 6\n\u2200t < \u000f, P \u03bc (x \u2208 I is (0, J)-blurred at t)\n\n\u2212\u2192\nrad(J)\u2192\u221e\n\n0\n\n\u2200J, dT V (\u03bc|J , \u03bck|J ) \u2212\u2192 0\nk\u2192\u221e\n\n|\u03bck (A) \u2212 \u03bc(A)| \u2212\u2192 0\nk\u2192\u221e\n\n|radius(J)| \u2264 k so\n\u2022 we let k go to \u221e\n\u2022 then we let |radius(J)| go to \u221e\nconclusion : \u2200t < \u000f, |P \u03bc (\u03b7(t) \u2208 A) \u2212 \u03bc(A)| = 0\nFigure 3: Scheme of the proof\n\n\f3.2\n\nProof of Lemma 5\n\nAs mentionned in the proof of Theorem 4, the idea to prove this lemma is to use the event\n\"the initial configurations of the two processes coincide on J\". Then, the study differs\ndepending on whether this event occurs or not. A diagram of the main steps of the proof is\ngiven at the end of the section.\nRecall that we coupled a forest-fire process \u03b7 on Zd with an initial configuration of law\n\u03bc and the Gk -forest-fire process \u03b7 k with an initial configuration of law \u03bck , by using the\nsame Poisson processes on each site and by optimally coupling \u03bc|J and \u03bck|J . Let \u03bd be the\ndistribution of the optimal coupling. We have\nk\n\n|P \u03bc (\u03b7(t) \u2208 A) \u2212 P \u03bc (\u03b7 k (t) \u2208 A)| = |P \u03bd ((\u03b7(t), \u03b7 k (t)) \u2208 A \u00d7 X) \u2212 P \u03bd ((\u03b7(t), \u03b7 k (t)) \u2208 X \u00d7 A)|.\nConsider now the event \"the initial configurations of the two processes coincide on J\".

These events occur when there\nexists a time t1 > 0 and a site x in I where the two configurations are not the same, i.e.\n\u03b7t1 ,x 6= \u03b7tk1 ,x . The two forest-fire processes are driven by the same Poisson processes and we\nconditionned by the event \"their initial configurations coincide on J\". So this non equality\nmust be the consequence of the influence of at least one cluster outside J on the box I. This\nis equivalent to the existence of a site in I whose state is influenced by the state of a site\noutside J. More precisely, there exists a site x in I which is (0, J)-blurred at time t1 .\n\n\fFirstly we give some notations associated with the blur processes. We denote by \u03b2 the\n(0, J)-blur process associated with \u03b7\u0304 and by \u03b2 k the (0, J)-blur process associated with \u03b7\u0304 k .\nTo simplify the notation, we do not write the dependence in J (neither in L) of the blur\nprocesses. Let N B be the set of configurations where all the sites of the box I have the\nvalue 0 and N Bx be the set of configurations where the site x has the value 0.\nThen with these notations we can write\n|1X\u00d7A (\u03b7(t), \u03b7 k (t)) \u2212 1A\u00d7X (\u03b7(t), \u03b7 k (t))| \u2264 1N B c \u00d7N B c (\u03b2(t), \u03b2 k (t)).\nSo\n|Eq| \u2264 E \u03bd (1N B c \u00d7N B c (\u03b2(t), \u03b2 k (t)) | CJ ) P \u03bd (CJ )\n\u2264 P \u03bd ( (\u03b2(t), \u03b2 k (t)) \u2208 N B c \u00d7 N B c | CJ ) * P \u03bd (CJ )\n\nThe (0, J)-blur process associated with a forest-fire process is defined only with the\nPoisson processes on the sites of the set J and the initial configuration of the sites of the\nbox J. We know that the two initial configurations coincide on J and that the two processes\nare driven by the same Poisson processes on each site.
