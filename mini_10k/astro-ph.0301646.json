We present a preliminary look at the serendipitous observation of the intermediate polar TX Col by Chandra. The \u223c52 ksec observation is uninterrupted, providing an opportunity to disentangle the\nlight curve and power spectra components. We illustrate the energydependence of the power spectrum.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nTX Col is a 15-th mag object discovered by HEAO-1 (Wood et al. 1984) and\nrecognized as an intermediate polar in 1985/6 (Buckley et al. 1985; Tuohy et al.\n1986). Its orbital period is 20,592 sec with a spin period of \u223c1910 sec (Tuohy\net al 1986; Mhlahlo et al., these proceedings).\n2.\n\nChandra Observation\n\nTX Col was observed by Chandra on 2000 July 26/27 for \u223c53 ksec (observation\nidentification number 914); the target was the cluster of galaxies Cl J0542.84100 to measure the X-ray temperature function of clusters (e.g., Ikebe et al.\n2002). The cluster was within 1\u2032 of the aimpoint, placing TX Col \u223c6\u2032 .7 arcmin\noff-axis on CCD 1 of the 'imaging' portion of the ACIS detector. Figure 1 shows\nthe Chandra field-of-view showing that 5 ACIS CCDs were active during the\nobservation. TX Col and the galaxy cluster are indicated.\nThe estimated count rate was \u223c0.57 counts s\u22121 with a background rate of\n0.006 counts s\u22121 . Both values were obtained by extracting the counts in circles\nof radii 0.3 and 1 arcmin, respectively. The background circle was displaced from\nthe position of TX Col by \u223c2\u2032 because TX Col falls sufficiently close to the edge\nof the CCD that \u223chalf of an annulus centered on TX Col's position would have\nextended beyond the chip's edge. A narrow rectangular region was excluded\nfrom the outer portions of the TX Col extraction to eliminate the presence of\nthe frame transfer events.\nThe off-axis angle reduces the effects of event pileup (Davis 2001). The\nstreak caused by the frame transfer determines the position of TX Col along\nthe CCD columns. We adopted the peak number of events on that line as the\n1\n\n\f2\n\nSchlegel & Salinas\nFigure 1.\n\nChandra ACIS field-of-view of TX Col.\n\nN\nE\n\n:50\n\n:55\n\n\u221241:00\nTX Col\n:05\nCl J0542.8\u22124100\n:10\n05 :43\n\n05 :42\n\ncenter of the observed point spread function. We extracted a radial profile using\n21 elliptical annuli spread across \u223c21 pixels (\u223c10\u2032\u2032 .5); a theoretical point spread\nfunction was generated from the Chandra PSF library at the observed off-axis\nangle. The two functions agreed to better than 5% in the core of the profile and\nindicated that pileup is at most a minor component of the TX Col observation.\n\n3.\n\nLight Curves\n\nWe filtered the events into three energy bands: 0.5-1.5, 1.5-4, and 4-8 keV in an\neffort to separate the high energy source emission and the low-energy absorption.\nThe middle band served simply to permit defining a color. We extracted the\nevents and binned them into 20 bins folded on the spin period of 1910 sec. We\narbitrarily adopted the time of the first Chandra event as the starting point\nfor the phasing for this preliminary analysis. Figure 2 shows the result. The\nzero point is incorrect by \u223c0.5 in phase (depending upon how one defines the\n'peak'). The soft band shows a humped behavior approximately symmetric\nabout the maximum. The medium band shows a steeper rise to maximum with\na gradual fall. The hard band is flattened with perhaps a steep rise just after\nphase 0.0.\nFigure 3 (top) shows the complete ACIS light curve, \u223c52 ksec or \u223c26 spin\ncycles in length. We can easily count the spin cycles, but note that the envelope\nof the amplitudes changes significantly across the observation. Figure 3 (bottom)\nexpands a portion of the full light curve to show the significant changes in\namplitude among individual spin cycles.\n\n\f3\n\nAPS Conf. Ser.

Ser. Style\n4.\n\nPower Spectra\n\nPower spectra were computed in the three energy bands for the entire observation\nas well as across the entire ACIS bandpass for subsets of the observation. There\nare insufficient events to examine power spectra of energy-filtered subsets.\nThe power spectra illustrate differences in amplitudes of the various components as a function of energy. The spin frequency is the dominant component\nin the soft and medium bands, but at the highest energies, the \u03c9 \u2212 \u03a9 component dominates. Also visible is significant power at the half-integer frequencies,\nparticularly near 8.2\u00d710\u22124 Hz, suggesting the presence of a 2\u03c9 \u2212 29 \u03a9 component.\nIf we split the observation into two 'orbits' at precisely the orbital period\n(the first 20592 sec and the second), and Fourier transform the data, we obtain the power spectra shown in Figure 5. Note that the \u03c9 \u2212 \u03a9 component is\nessentially missing from the second orbit.\nTable 1 shows a history of the detected periods from ASCA and ROSAT\n(Norton et al. 1997), and the Chandra observation. Additional periods may be\nuncovered in the Chandra observation as the analyses of the data are refined.\nTable 1 represents the primary results to date; quantitative measurements will\nbe included in the final paper describing the Chandra observation; that paper\nis expected to be submitted for publication in early spring 2003. At this point,\nthe power spectra imply the soft X-rays are disk-fed because the amplitude of\nthe \u03c9 \u2212 \u03a9 component is approximately equal to the amplitude of the \u03c9 + \u03a9.\nOur goal with this observation is the Fourier decomposition of the light curve\n(Warner 1986; Norton et al. 1996).\nAcknowledgments.
