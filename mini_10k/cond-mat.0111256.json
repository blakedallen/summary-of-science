When the nominal isotropic s-wave interaction strength becomes tunable\nthrough a Feshbach resonance (e.g. as for 85 Rb atoms), anisotropic dipolar effects are shown to be\ndetectable under current experimental conditions [E. A. Donley et al., Nature 412, 295 (2001)].\n\nCollective excitations play an important role in probing microscopic interactions [1]. The recently available\ngaseous atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC), have\nproven to be a profitable testing ground for such studies\n[2]. Atomic BEC are dilute with properties completely\ndetermined by binary interactions. Experimentally they\nare created at very low temperatures when the short\nrange atom-atom (collision) interaction can be described\nby a single parameter: the s-wave scattering length asc .\nAll higher order partial wave collisions are suppressed at\nzero collision energy in a short ranged potential. This\nenable atoms to be modelled as hard spheres of radius\nasc , reflecting the isotropic ground state interaction. Inside an electric or magnetic field, however, ground state\natoms may be polarized, e.g. in a magnetic trap the\ndirection of atomic spins (of the valance electron for alkali) becomes aligned. The resulting dipole interaction\nbetween condensed atom pairs many not simply average\nout. In this article, we investigate such spin dipole effects\non shape oscillation frequencies of an atomic condensate.\nAlthough dipolar effects are typically small compared to\nthe dominant s-wave contact interaction, our study indicates that these shifts become observable in the 85 Rb\nBEC [3, 4], when a Feshbach resonance is used to tune\nasc near zero [3].\nDipolar interaction in atomic BEC leads to physics beyond the usual s-wave contact term, mainly because of\nthe modified low energy collision threshold behavior due\nto the anisotropic nature of the interaction [5]. For magnetic spin dipoles, the net effect in the dilute gas sample\nis rather small, one can therefor approximate the complete two-body interaction by [6, 7]\n2\n~ = g0 \u03b4(R)\n~ + g2 1 \u2212 3 cos \u03b8R\nV (R)\nR3\n\n(1)\n\n~ = ~r \u2212 ~r \u2032 , and g0 = 4\u03c0h\u03042 asc /M is the s-wave\nwhere R\ncontact term.

Figure 1 illustrates the geometry for two aligned\ndipoles along the local magnetic field (z-axis). Several\ninteresting properties of a dipolar condensate have already been discussed [6, 7, 8, 9]. In this paper, we focus\non the shape oscillations of a trapped dipolar condensate\nassuming a tunable asc .\nIn the standard approach, low energy collective excitations are described by the Bogoliubov theory [10].

Mode a is purely radial due to the cylindrical\nsymmetry. It's angular momentum projection along the zaxis m = 2. Mode b and c are respectively the quadrupole\nand monopole oscillations. They are customarily called the\nlow and high m = 0 modes.\n\ncondensate wavefunction \u03c6(~r, t) is governed by the GrossPitaevskii equation, while the non-condensed atoms are\ndescribed by quasi-particles [11], some of which have been\nstudied experimentally [12, 13]. The inclusion of the nonlocal dipolar interaction makes the Bogoliubov approach\nimpractical to implement numerically. We therefore will\nrely on two alternative methods to study the three characteristic shape modes [12] as graphically illustrated for\na cylindrical symmetric trap in Fig. 2.\nFirst we adopt the highly successful time-dependent\nvariation approach used in Ref.

(4)\n12\n33\n13\nIn the JILA experiments [3, 4] with 85 Rb in the |F =\n2, MF = 2i state, the valance electron spin gives rise to\nan aligned magnetic dipole moment of \u03bc = 2\u03bcB /3 (\u03bcB\nbeing the Bohr magneton). We take the radial frequency\nto be \u03bdr = 17.35 (Hz), in addition to a tunable asc and\ntrap aspect ratio \u03bb as in the experiment [4]. Our results confirm that spin dipole effects become detectable\nin terms of shifts of the shape oscillation frequencies. We\nfirst report variational calculated results as the analytic\nformulae obtained allow for a careful analysis of the underline physics.\n\nFigure 3 shows the three mode frequencies for N = 104\nin a spherical trap (\u03bb = 1). The solid and dashed lines\ndenote respectively mode frequencies without and with\nthe dipolar interaction. The vertical lines show the critical values of aC\nsc when the mode character switching b \u2194 c\noccurs. This mode switching occurs whenever the overall\nmean-field condensate interaction changes from repulsive\nto attractive or vice versa. When squeezed along the radial direction, mode c (b) became predominantly excited\nfor an overall attractive (repulsive) condensate as atoms\nare pulled in (pushed out) along the z-direction. Without the spin dipole interaction, this mode switch always\noccurs at asc = 0. The anisotropic dipole interaction affects the overall condensate mean field and the stability\ndepending on the trap aspect ratio \u03bb [6, 8]. Depending\non the configuration of the dipoles, dipole-dipole interactions can be either attractive or repulsive. For two\ndipoles, if they were placed in a plane perpendicular to\ntheir polarization (\u2191\u2191), they repel each other. On the\nother hand, they attract each other if they were placed\nalong the direction of their polarization (\u2192\u2192). For a\ncloud of trapped dipoles one therefore expects that repulsive interaction increases as one increases \u03bb, which\nleads to increased condensate stability. In Fig. 4, we\ndisplay the \u03bb dependence of the critical scattering length\naC\nsc as obtained from the variational calculation. We find\nthat the effective scattering length aeff (introduced earlier by us in [6]) provides a reasonable approximation to\nthe sign of the overall condensate mean field. In terms of\nthe actual values, however, the results in the figure show\nthat aeff differs significantly from aC\nsc when \u03bb deviates\nfrom the neighborhood of unity.\nIn Fig. 5, we show the \u03bb-dependence of the dipole\ninduced fractional changes to the mode frequencies for a\ncondensate with 104 atoms at asc = \u22121 (a0 ). For strongly\nprolate or oblate traps, the shifts are in a few percentage\nrange even with such small numbers of atom. Figure 6\nsummarizes our results for the atom number dependence\nof the dipole induced frequency shifts for the trap aspect ratio \u03bb = 6.8/17.35 [4].

The Gaussian ansatz\n(2) becomes questionable near collapse as reflected in the\nseemly divergent results when N is increased.\nThese results (Figs. 3-6) clearly show that dipolar effects are detectable in the current 85 Rb BEC setup, given\nthe extraordinary capability of 0.1% frequency measurement [16]. To confirm the validity of the variational calculations, we have invested considerable effort in an exact\nnumerical method based on the time dependent GrossPitaevskii equation [17]. By applying external periodic\n\nwith \u2206\u03b7 (t) = \u03b70 + \u03b4\u03b7 sin(\u03a9\u03b7 t + \u03c6\u03b7 ) to the condensate\nground state, selected shape oscillations become predominantly excited, as first numerically implemented by\nRuprecht et al. [17].\nAfter a selected duration T , typically several periods\nof the trap radial oscillation, the forcing term VF is tuned\noff. The free propagation of the time dependent GrossPitaevskii equation\np is continued, and the dynamic condensate width h\u03b7 2 (t)i is sampled. The shape oscillation frequencies arepthen identified by taking the Fourier\ntransformation of h\u03b7 2 (t)i. A typical result from this\ncalculation is given in Fig. 7, which shows remarkably\nclear signal. By varying V\u03b7 , \u03b70 , \u03b4\u03b7 , and \u03a9\u03b7 , our results\nare self-consistently checked, i.e. to be independent of\nall parameters involved as they should be in the small\namplitude oscillation limit and to be numerically accurate. For the experimental parameter of \u03bdr = 17.35 (Hz)\nand \u03bdz = 6.8 (Hz). We have computed the shape oscillation frequencies numerically for asc = 0, 1, \u22122 (a0 ),\nand compared them with the variational results in Table\nI. The quoted errors for the numerical results shown in\nthe tables mainly come from the limited sampling window in time. Further improvement is hard as the calculations are time consuming and numerical accuracies\nbecome difficult to control at long times. We find that\n\n\f4\nTABLE I: Mode frequencies (in unit of \u03bdr ) with dipolar interaction\nasc (a0 ) mode\nnumerical\nvariational\nb\n2.0010 \u00b1 0.0040\n2.0016\n\u22122\nc\n0.8578 \u00b1 0.0085\n0.8657\nb\n1.9959 \u00b1 0.0028\n1.9964\n0\nc\n0.7874 \u00b1 0.0022\n0.7895\nb\n0.7705 \u00b1 0.0060\n0.7675\n+1\nc\n1.9974 \u00b1 0.0032\n1.9974\n\nTABLE II: Mode frequencies (in unit of \u03bdr ) without dipolar\ninteraction\nasc (a0 ) mode\nnumerical\nvariational\nb\n2.0073 \u00b1 0.0025\n2.0075\n\u22122\nc\n0.8546 \u00b1 0.0051\n0.8591\nb\n0.7664 \u00b1 0.0054\n0.7622\n+1\nc\n2.0004 \u00b1 0.0024\n2.0004\n\nthe variational results are consistent with the exact numerical results. In order to affirm such mode frequency\nshifts are indeed from the dipolar interaction, rather than\na mis-calibration of asc , we also need to validate the variational approach in the absence of the dipole interaction.\nThis was explored earlier in Ref. [14], where the numerical and variational results of the condensate dynamics\nwere compared. Our results are presented in Table II. It\nconvincingly proves that dipolar efforts reported in the\nTable I is due to the physics of spin dipole interaction.\nIn conclusion, we have studied low energy shape oscillations of a trapped dipolar condensate. Using a magnetic field dependent Feshbach resonance to tune the swave scattering length to around zero, we have shown\n\n[1] Theory of Interacting Fermi Systems, Ph.

These shifts\ngrow with the number of trapped atoms, and are around\n1% level with as few as 104 atoms. We have also independently verified the accuracy of the variational calculation by developing a rigorous numerical approach for\nthe three predominant shape oscillation modes. Near a\nFeshbach resonance, significant atom loss might occur as\nfound in the Na experiment [18]. The subsequent damping could lead to a broadening of the shape oscillation\nthus masking the direct observation of the proposed spin\ndipole effects. Fortunately for 85 Rb atoms, the condition\nof asc (B) = 0 corresponds to far off resonance on the\nhigh B-field side, where impressive controls have been\ndemonstrated without any significant loss [4]. Over the\nlast few years, mean field theory has proven to be remarkably successful when applied to BEC physics. The\ns-wave g0 contact pseudo-potential has made the concept\nof scattering length asc widely popular. It is often said\nthat scattering length is the only relevant atomic parameter since the net interaction effect scales as N asc /aho for\na harmonically trapped atomic condensate, where aho is\nthe trap size. Dipole interactions as discussed in this\narticle points to interesting physics beyond the s-wave.\nWithin the current experimental regime of dilute atomic\ngases, mean field theory remains applicable and allows for\nthe calculation of dipolar induced shifts of collective excitation frequencies. Successful experimental verification\nof our predictions will shed new light on atomic BEC.\nWe thank Drs. C. E. Wieman and E. Cornell for helpful discussions.
