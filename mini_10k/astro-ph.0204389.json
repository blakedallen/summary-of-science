The enduring quest has been to understand\nhow such diverse structures emerge out of primeval density fluctuations that\ngrew over time due to the effects of gravity.\nAn important role in the structure-formation process is played by the largescale shocks that form as the primordial density fluctuations become non-linear\nand the accretion flows on collapsing structures become supersonic (Quilis,\nIbnez, & Saez 1998, Miniati et al. 2000, Ensslin et al. 2001). Likely these\nshocks are responsible for heating of most of the diffuse intergalactic medium\n(IGM) up to \u2248 105\u22127 K (Cen & Ostriker 1999). Given their large sizes and\nlong lifetimes, these shocks have also been proposed to be the sites for the\nacceleration of very high energy cosmic-rays up to 1018 \u2212 1019 eV (Norman,\nMelrose & Achterberg 1995, Kang, Ryu, & Jones 1996). In addition, it has\nbeen recently pointed out that the cosmic-ray ions accelerated at intergalactic\n1\n\nE-mail addresses: joydeep@iucaa.ernet.in (Bagchi),\nensslin@mpa-garching.mpg.de (Ensslin),\nfm@mpa-garching.mpg.de (Miniati),\nstalin@upso.ernet.in (Stalin), msingh@upso.ernet.in (Singh),\nsomak@star.sr.bham.ac.uk (Raychaudhury), deephum@yahoo.com (Humeshkar).\n2 Present address: School of Physics, University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad 500046,\nIndia.\n3 Corresponding author.

Exploration of such ideas\nthrough direct observations is truly important because even after close to a\ncentury since cosmic-rays were discovered by Victor Hess in 1912, we do not\nknow how and where they are accelerated.\nDirect evidence for the ability of cosmic shock waves to accelerate particles is given by the observed association of the so called 'cluster radio relic'\nsources with locations where shock waves are expected from X-ray observations\n(Ensslin et al. 1998). Diffusive shock acceleration may be operative at these\nlocations and responsible for the radio emitting electrons. But also shock reillumination of fossil radio plasma in remnants of former active radio galaxies\nis a viable explanation (Ensslin & Gopal-Krishna 2001). The latter mechanism\nseems to be the explanation of at least some of the cluster radio relics, since\nin some cases very filamentary and torus-like morphologies could be resolved.\nSuch morphologies are predicted by numerical simulations of the shock passage\nof a fossil radio plasma bubble (Ensslin & Br\u00fcggen 2002). However it is quite\npossible that some of the cluster radio relic sources are caused by diffusive\nshock acceleration of thermal electrons (Miniati et al. 2001b).\nIn order for particles to be accelerated, magnetic fields have to be present\nat the shock waves. Magnetic fields are observed in the intra-cluster medium\n(ICM) of clusters of galaxies by Faraday rotation of polarized background\nsources (Clarke, Kronberg, & B\u00f6hringer 2001). They are further revealed by\nthe presence of cluster-wide Mpc scale radio halos in some clusters of galaxies, believed to be the result of synchrotron emission of relativistic electrons\naccelerated in magnetic fields. The role of the magnetic fields in clusters is\nstill a matter of debate, but some recent works indicate important dynamical influences in the ICM (Clarke, Kronberg, & B\u00f6hringer 2001, Vikhlinin,\nMarkevitch, & Murray 2001). Outside clusters, no firm detections of magnetic\nfield in the intergalactic medium (IGM) has yet been reported to our knowledge, but speculations on the magnitude of magnetic fields in IGM range from\n10\u22127 G to 10\u221212 G.\nThe origin of cosmic magnetic fields is currently unknown and for this reason\nany observational evidence of them in the IGM environment is of great importance. Magnetic fields could have a primordial origin or they could have been\nseeded and amplified during the relatively recent history of large scale structure formation. In this latter scenario, the Biermann battery mechanism (Biermann 1950) operating at either large-scale shocks (Kulsrud et al. 1997, Ryu,\nKang & Biermann 1998) or ionization fronts (Gnedin et al. 2000) has been\nproposed as a viable model for generating seeds of strength 10\u221219 \u2212 10\u221223 G,\nto be subsequently amplified by turbulent motions and/or galactic dynamos\nup to \u03bcG level. Alternatively, the origin of cosmic magnetic fields has been\nattributed to the pollution of the inter-galactic medium by winds and out3\n\n\fflows from primeval galaxies (Kronberg et al. 1999) and/or quasars and radio\ngalaxies (Furlanetto & Loeb 2001, Gopal-Krishna & Wiita 2001). In most of\nthese cases, magnetic fields would be expected to be present not only inside\ngalaxy clusters, but also in filaments. There were earlier attempts to estimate\nthe magnetization of the Universe from quasars (Daly & Loeb 1990, MedinaTanco & Ensslin 2001).\nThe detection of magnetic fields in the IGM outside clusters of galaxies would\nhelp the understanding of the origin of magnetic fields within galaxies and\ngalaxy clusters. At the same time, observational evidence for cosmic-rays in\nthe intergalactic medium would allow us to further our understanding of high\nenergy phenomena occurring in cosmic structures which have recently received\nmuch attention [see e.g., Feretti & Giovannini (1996) and references therein].\nObservationally exploring these issues would provide important clues for many\nphysical problems, including, among others, the theories of ultra-high energy\ncosmic-ray acceleration and their intergalactic propagation, the origin of radio\nand hard X-ray emission from galaxy clusters, and the contribution to the diffuse gamma-ray background from shock-accelerated TeV cosmic-ray electrons\n(Loeb & Waxman 2000).\nIn this paper we report on the observational evidence of large-scale diffuse radio synchrotron emission (\u00a7 4) over an extended region around ZwCl 2341.1+0000,\nwhich is likely to be a proto-cluster of galaxies containing several large filaments (\u00a7 3). The ROSAT X-ray observation of this structure is presented in\n\u00a7 5. The result of a search for association of ZwCl 2341.1+0000 with other\ngalaxy concentrations on a super-cluster scale is reported in \u00a7 6. Our observations imply the existence of magnetic fields and relativistic electrons at GeV\nenergies over scales of several Mpc (\u00a7 4 & \u00a7 7). The observed radio emission\nis compared with theoretical predictions from analytical (\u00a7 7) and numerical\nmodeling (\u00a7 8) of particle acceleration at structure formation shocks. Finally\nin \u00a7 9 we discuss the implications of our results and the outlook for future\nwork.\nUnless stated otherwise, we adopt an \u03a9m = 1 Einstein-de Sitter cosmology\nand the Hubble constant H0 = 50 h50 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 . The angular scale is\n330 h\u22121\n50 kpc per arcminute at a redshift z=0.3. The radio spectral index \u03b1 is\ndefined such that flux density F\u03bd is a power-law F\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u03b1 .\n\n2\n\nThe ZwCl 2341.1+0000\n\nThe multi-Mpc scale filamentary network of galaxies in ZwCl 2341.1+0000\nwas discovered in an ongoing program to search for the large-scale diffuse radio emission (\u223c 1 Mpc or larger) originating in distant clusters of galaxies.\n4\n\n\fThe primary aim of this program is to investigate the origin and evolution\nof high energy relativistic particles and magnetic fields in the IGM of large\ncosmic structures. To this end, we searched for the presence of diffuse radio emission in the field of several Abell and Zwicky clusters or groups with\nmeasured/estimated redshifts & 0.15. Although not a statistically complete\nsample, it nevertheless contains many clusters that have no detailed information available so far. As a first step, we searched for radio emission in the 'New\nVLA All Sky Survey' (NVSS (http://www.cv.nrao.edu/nvss/)) images at\nthe 1.4 GHz frequency (Condon et al. 1998). The NVSS survey uses the VLA's\nmost compact D-array configuration and is well suited for detection of large\nstructures of angular scales up to \u223c 15 arcmin in extent. The completeness\nlimit for point sources is about 2.5 mJy and the angular resolution (beam size)\nis about 45 seconds of arc.\nIn the NVSS data, we discovered, among others, a large-scale diffuse emission\nfeature in the region of galaxy concentration ZwCl 2341.1+0000 located at\nR.A. 23h 43m 39s .7 Dec. +00\u25e6 16\u2032 39\u2032\u2032 . It is classified as a distant group 5 or \"extremely distant\" cluster with cluster diameter 22\u2032 by Zwicky et al. (1961-68)).\nFurther literature and data search with the NASA Extragalactic Database\n(NED (http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu)) showed no additional information on this concentration of galaxies. However, the optical images of the Second Generation Palomar Digitized Sky Survey (DSS-2 (http://archive.eso.org/dss/dss))\nrevealed a very interesting cosmological scale (projected size \u223c 25 arcmin or\n8h\u22121\n50 Mpc ) filamentary network of faint galaxies, which had the distinctive\nnon-relaxed morphology of a forming structure. Motivated by these findings,\nand with an aim to investigating the physical properties of this object in\ngreater detail, we obtained several more detailed observations at radio and\noptical wavelengths. These observations and the results of their analysis form\nthe subject matter of the following sections.\n\n3\n\nOptical data\n\n3.1 CCD imaging and analysis\nWe obtained several deep optical and NIR images with the 1-m Carl-Zeiss\nreflector at the State Observatory, Nainital, India, in November 1999. Due\nto constraints of time and scheduling, only data in Johnson V , R, and I\nfilters were obtained using a CCD camera equipped with a 2K \u00d7 2K pixels\nchip, giving a plate scale of 0.37 arcsec/pixel, and a field of view of about 13\narcmin at the f/13 Cassegrain focus. The gain and the read-out noise were 10\ne\u2212 /ADU and 13.7 e\u2212 respectively. The sky conditions during the observations\nwere photometric but the seeing was moderate at \u223c2 arcsec FWHM. We took\n5\n\n\fseveral frames in each filter with total exposure time sufficient for adequate\nphotometric accuracy. Photometric zero points and colour transformations\nwere defined by observing Landolt standards. The initial optical processing\nof the CCD frames was done using the IRAF software and the final object\ndetection, magnitude evaluation and object (star/galaxy) classification was\nperformed using the 'SExtractor' image analysis program (Bertin & Arnouts\n1996).\nThe resulting source catalogue contains a total of 271 galaxies detected to\na magnitude limit of mV = 21.9, mR = 20.9, and mI = 20.2, and which\nwere detected independently in all three passbands. The total magnitudes for\ngalaxies at the faint end had typical errors of \u223c0.05\u20130.10 mag. The extinction corrections are small (AB < 0.1 mag over the area of observation) due\nto the high galactic latitude (b = \u221258\u25e6 ) position. The parameters for the\nextinction were obtained from the IRAS based galactic extinction estimates\nby Schlegel, Finkbeiner & Davis (1998). The astrometric conversion from the\npixel to equatorial co-ordinates was performed with IRAF employing several\nbright astrometric stars identified on the CCD images.\n\n3.2 Optical morphology and luminosity\n\nThe Fig. 1 shows the R-band co-added image of the galaxy concentration. Morphologically it is best described as a long S-shaped main filament of galaxies\nextending over 12 arcmin (\u223c 4h\u22121\n50 Mpc, which is the size of the CCD frame),\nand branching structures of several Mpc-scale galaxy sub-filaments mainly\nto the east and north-east of the main chain. The photometric redshift estimate places the structure at a redshift of z\u2248 0.3, supported by spectroscopic\nevidence from the SDSS survey (see \u00a73.4 below).\nIf the entire structure is actually a web-like formation at a single redshift\nand not an artifact of projection (evidence in support of this is presented below), the implications are clearly very important. The branching chain structure and multiple peaks in the galaxy distribution might indicate hierarchical\nmerging of cosmic structures distributed on Mpc scales, at a moderately high\nredshift. This type of structure is to be expected in evolving Universe according to the \"cosmic web\" theory of structure formation (Bond, Kofman\n& Pogosyan 1996), and it is frequently seen in computer simulations such as\nthe the Hubble-volume N-body simulation (Colberg et al. 2000), and also in\nobservational surveys such as the Las Campanas redshift survey (Doroshkevich et al. 1996). These results predict that matter in the Universe should be\nconcentrated along filaments, and clusters of galaxies should be found where\nthese filaments intersect. It is interesting to note that the filamentary morphology of ZwCl 2341.1+0000 is quite similar to a more distant proto-cluster\n6\n\n\fRX J1716.6+6708 at z = 0.81 (Henry et al. 1997).\nThe average integrated galaxy V luminosity of 12 randomly selected positions\non the main filament and side chains, after correcting for the local background\noffset from main structure, yields a value of 2.7 \u00d7 1011 L\u2299 /arcmin2 (\u00b154%)\nfor the observed average luminosity of the filament. The indicated dispersion\nabout the mean value represents the fluctuation of the surface brightness occuring over the galaxy filaments, rather than the uncertainty of measurement.\n\n3.3 Galaxy colours & estimating photometric redshifts\n\nWe estimated photometric redshifts for the galaxies in our catalogue to ascertain the mean redshift of the concentration, and to verify that most of the\ngalaxies projected on the sky plane near this concentration represent an association in real space. This method is a powerful tool for detecting high spatial\ndensity regions such as clusters and groups and has recently been applied to\nthe study of galaxy populations in high-z clusters of galaxies (Lubin et al.\n2000, Gladders et al. 1998). From our photometric catalogue of galaxies in V ,\nR and I bands, a set of 6 plots; three of colour-magnitude (C-M) diagrams\nand three of colour-colour (C-C) diagrams, were generated. Figs. 2 & 3 show\nthe (V \u2212 I) and (R \u2212 I) colours vs. I magnitudes for all the galaxies. On both\nplanes, a well defined linear sequence of early-type (E/S0) galaxies is clearly\nvisible.\nEarly-type galaxies form the dominant population in cores of all clusters, rich\nor poor, and across a wide range of redshifts, low to z > 1 (e.g., Gladders et\nal. (1998)). Their ubiquitous colour-magnitude sequence, first noted locally by\nBaum (Baum 1959), is now well documented in many clusters, ranging from\nComa to clusters at redshifts up to z = 1 (Stanford, Eisenhardt, & Dickinson\n1998, Ellis et al. 1997, Gladders & Yee 2000). The colours of elliptical galaxies\nbecome bluer as they become less luminous. We have detected this red C-M\nsequence on all three C-M diagrams, which shows that at least the dominant\ngalactic population consists of early-type galaxies that are part of this filament\nat a single redshift. This is a good indicator of association of galaxies in a largescale structure, as a random projection of field galaxies can not generate the\nred sequence which is characteristic of clusters. On the C-M diagrams, apart\nfrom E/S0s, a population of blue galaxies (late spirals and irregulars) can also\nbe seen in the lower-right region.\nFrom the position of each galaxy in a 3-dimensional colour space, consisting of\northogonal axes (V \u2212R), (V \u2212I), and (R\u2212I), the three colour-colour diagrams\nwere obtained. These diagrams can be used to identify the galaxies of various\nHubble types and to obtain the redshifts. The Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 show two of\n7\n\n\fthese projections that show galaxies of very wide range of colours. A distinct\ncluster of data points near (V \u2212 R) = 0.9, (V \u2212 I) = 1.6 and (R \u2212 I) = 0.7 can\nbe seen on these plots. These identify a coeval population of red galaxies of\nearly Hubble types at a single redshift. Therefore, we have further proof that\nZwCl 2341.1+0000 is indeed a real concentration of galaxies.\nThe properties of the galactic populations in these filaments were investigated\nusing the spectrophotometric evolutionary models of Guiderdoni & RoccaVolmerange (1988). These models give evolutionary synthetic spectra for a\nnumber of spectral classes reproducing the range of spectrophotometric properties for the Hubble sequence. From this work, the data on predictions for\napparent magnitudes and colours of galaxies of wide range of redshifts were\nobtained and fitted to the observed colours and magnitudes. The evolutionary tracks, representing the redshift evolution of galaxy colours, were plotted\non the colour-colour diagrams. The data included the effects of K-correction,\nevolutionary correction and of the emission of nebular component plus the\ncorrection for internal extinction (see Guiderdoni & Rocca-Volmerange (1988)\nfor exact details). The colours of E and S0 galaxies are useful in determination\nof redshift because of the uniformity of their spectral properties and because\nof a large 4000 A\u25e6 break due to the Balmer edge in their spectra provides the\nstrongest signal for photometric redshift estimation. In Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 it\nis apparent that the evolutionary tracks for the early type E/S0 galaxies fall\nclosest to the observed data cluster at redshift z \u223c 0.3. The colours for E/S0's\nat redshifts z = 0.2 or z = 0.4 both showed a much poorer fit to the data,\nparticularly on the (V \u2212 I) vs. (V \u2212 R) plot which has the steeper slope.\nTo avoid projection effects, the actual fit of the spectrophometric model colours\nto the observed data was performed in a 3-dimensional colour space. At redshift z = 0.3, the model colours for the E/S0 galaxies are: (V \u2212 R)mod = 0.92,\n(V \u2212 I)mod = 1.58, and (R \u2212 I)mod = 0.66. Enclosed within a sphere of radius\n0.30 colour index units centered on the model point, we found an agglomerate\nof 79 data points. These are the likely to be the E/S0 galaxies (having similar colours) that have high probability to belong to the filament. The radius\nof 0.30 colour-index units takes into account the intrinsic spread in colours\nof E/S0 galaxies observed in clusters. The plotted position of these galaxies\non the C-M diagrams (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3) forms well defined linear sequences\ncharacteristic of early type galaxies in clusters, confirming that they are E/S0\ngalaxies. The mean and standard deviation of these galaxy colours were calculated as: (V \u2212 I)E/S0 = 1.59 \u00b1 0.12, (V \u2212 R)E/S0 = 0.88 \u00b1 0.09 , and\n(R \u2212 I)E/S0 = 0.72 \u00b1 0.11. Clearly, the model for E/S0 galaxies fits the cluster\nphotometric observations quite well (within . 0.5\u03c3). From this evidence it\nwas estimated that the actual redshift is z = 0.30 \u00b1 0.05, which was used in\nall our analysis and interpretation. A more sophisticated analysis aiming at\ngreater precision was not attempted as the accuracy of the redshift estimate\nwas limited by the availability of only three photometric colours. The accu8\n\n\fracy of the photometrically estimated redshift is sufficient for the purpose of\nthe present paper. In addition, the plotted template colours for the galaxies\nof Hubble types Sa, Sb, Sc, Sd and Irr at z= 0.3 fitted the data well, as can\nbe seen in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, providing independent verification of the redshift\nestimate.\n3.4 Spectroscopic redshifts\nThe current release of the ongoing Sloan Digitized Sky Survey (York et al.\n2000) includes the spectra of four of the galaxies in our catalogue, from which\nredshifts are shown in Table 1. The location of these galaxies are shown by\narrows in Fig. 1. The mean redshift from these four galaxies, z \u223c0.267, is\nconsistent with our photometric redshift estimate in the previous section. For\nthe rest of paper, we will assume the redshift of the filamentary structure to\nbe z = 0.3.\nTable 1\nSpectroscopic redshifts from the SDSS\nGalaxy\n\nR.A.\n\nDec.\n\nMagnitude\n\nRedshift\n\nno.\n\nJ(2000)\n\nJ(2000)\n\n1\n\n23h 43m 38.2s\n\n00\u25e6 19\u2032 46\u2032\u2032\n\n18.9\n\n0.272093\n\n2\n\n23 43 40.7\n\n00 20 30\n\n17.6\n\n0.260870\n\n3\n\n23 43 34.6\n\n00 20 37\n\n18.0\n\n0.269087\n\n4\n\n23 43 21.7\n\n00 19 33\n\n17.7\n\n0.266947\n\n4\n\nThe radio observations\n\n4.1 The low resolution VLA (NVSS) radio data at 20 cm\nThe 1.4 GHz (\u03bb =20 cm) radio map obtained from the NVSS (http://www.cv.nrao.edu/nvss/)\narchives is shown superposed on the optical R-band CCD image in Fig. 6. The\noriginal data of 45 arcsec (FWHM) resolution was convolved with a Gaussian\nto obtain a 60 arcsec (FWHM) resolution beam in order to better detect the\nlarge-scale diffuse emission regions. The 1\u03c3 noise level on this image is within\nrange \u2248 0.5 \u2212 0.6 mJy/beam, whereas on the unsmoothed original image it\nwas \u2248 0.45 mJy/beam.\nMorphologically, the source appears to have a complex structure, but mainly\nconsisting of two parts: the southern section (at R.A. 23h 43m 49s , Dec. 00\u25e6 14\u2032 14\u2032\u2032 )\n9\n\n\fis \u2248 5 arcmin (1.65 h\u22121\n50 Mpc ) in size and is entirely diffuse in nature, and\nthe peak emission here is about 4 mJy/beam. The northern section (at R.A.\n23h 43m 39s , Dec. 00\u25e618\u2032 44\u2032\u2032 ), of similar \u22485 arcmin angular size, shows evidence\nof both diffuse and localized radio emissions. Within the northern radio structure, the data allows to resolve two more radio components which are henceforth called for convenience NN (the northern peak of 6 mJy/beam) and NS\n(the southern peak of 11.5 mJy/beam). The integrated flux density, position\nand spectral index for various regions of the source are reported in Table 2.\nThe spectral indices were calculated by convolving the NVSS radio map to the\nbroader resolution of the 320 MHz radio map discussed below. A faint 'radiobridge' type extension at R.A. 23h 43m 43s , Dec. 00\u25e6 16\u2032 31\u2032\u2032 between the two\nsections is an interesting feature. The surface brightness of this 'radio-bridge'\nis about 1.5-2.5 mJy/beam and therefore it is detected at the level of about\n3-4 \u03c3. A strong curvature in the main filament of galaxies can be clearly seen\nin this region. However, the curved section is not located on the radio-bridge\nbut shifted about 1.5 arcmin to the NE of it. We note that this pattern is\nagain reproduced in the ROSAT X-ray map (Fig. 11) which is discussed in\nbetter detail in \u00a7 5.\nMore significantly, the entire structure visible at radio wavelengths is of very\nlarge extent (at least 10 arcmin or 3.3 h\u22121\n50 Mpc ) and appears to be roughly\naligned with the main optical galaxy filament which is of similar size. Thus\nthe radio and optical structures are possibly related and co-spatial. We show\nbelow, from high resolution radio data, that only one elliptical galaxy could\nbe associated with a radio peak. The rest of the radio emission therefore\npossibly originates from diffuse synchrotron radiation (as inferred from the\nradio spectrum) from the inter-galactic medium.\n\n4.2 High resolution VLA 'FIRST' image and optical identification of possible\npoint sources\n\nThe VLA low resolution 20 and 90 cm radio images discussed here have only\nthe modest resolutions of \u223c1-1.8 arcmin, while in a portion of sky covered by\na galaxy cluster there can be several hundred galaxies. It is therefore possible\nthat a significant part of the radio emission could arise from the blend of radio\nsources in the cluster (and distant background point sources). It is therefore\nvery important that we should identify the regions of genuine large-scale diffuse emission from superposed point sources. To check for this serious source of\nconfusion, we have cross correlated the optical ZwCl 2341.1+0000 cluster field\nwith the NRAO 'FIRST' (http://sundog.stsci.edu/first/description.html)\nradio catalogue. The 'FIRST' survey, conducted with the VLA B-configuration,\ncontains high resolution (\u2248 5 arcsec beam) radio maps at 1.4 GHz with a flux\ndensity threshold of 1 mJy and a typical rms of 0.15 mJy/beam.

To achieve an equivalent degree of precision, for optical identification we\nhave used the Palomar Digitised Sky Survey (DSS-2) red sensitive plate for\nwhich the astrometric accuracy is better than \u00b10.5 arcsec r.m.s. With such\ngood radio and optical astrometric precision, it is possible to identify superposed point sources, if any are present. We note that the large-scale structures\n& 30 arcsec angular size are resolved out by the FIRST survey, but compact\nfeatures, such as unresolved radio-cores or jets, can be easily identified.\nFig. 7 shows the FIRST image (contours) superposed on the DSS-2 image (gray\nscale) for optical identification of radio sources. The image covers the northern\nsection of the radio filament detected by the NVSS. FIRST survey finds radio\ncounterparts at the position of the two northern sources NN and NS (see \u00a7 4.1\non the NVSS data), but the southern region of diffuse emission is completely\nresolved out and shows no compact radio peak. Similarly, the extended largescale diffuse emission detected in the 320 MHz data (discussed below) also\ndoes not show any point components in the FIRST data. The integrated flux\ndensities of the two sources detected by FIRST are: in the northern source NN\n1.8 \u00b1 0.4 mJy and in the southern source NS 9.3 \u00b1 0.6 mJy. The integrated\nflux densities of the same two sources mapped by NVSS are: in the northern\nsource NN 11 \u00b12 mJy and in the southern source NS 17 \u00b12 mJy (see Table 2).\nClearly, this indicates that while FIRST is actually able to map the regions\nclose to peak emission in both theses sources, there is considerable amount of\ndiffuse emission associated with both which is largly resolved out due to lack\nof short interferometric spacings (as expected of VLA B-array data). We note\n11\n\n\fthat even with this limitation the FIRST map of the southern radio source\nNS shows a diffuse morphology and some hints of partially resolved internal\nstructure consisting possibly of two parallel filaments \u2248 6 arcsec apart. These\nfeatures can be better seen on the detailed radio image shown in Fig. 8. We\nneed more sensitive radio maps to better understand what these features really\nare.\nNo object classified as a galaxy with the CCD data could be located on the\nstronger southern radio peak NS. A faint mv = 20.81 galaxy (G1) was located\n6.2 arcsec to the north of the radio peak (Fig. 7), and another brighter mv =\n18.21 galaxy (G2) 6.5 arcsec to the south-east direction, but their identification\nwith the radio source is doubtful. The combined radio and optical positional\nerrors correspond to an error circle of radius 1 arcsec and both galaxies are\nshifted by \u2248 6\u03c3s from the radio peak. The photometric colours of galaxy G1\nare quite red and not consistent with those of a standard elliptical galaxy\nat z = 0.3, but are more like those of a higher redshift galaxy. Thus based\non high resolution radio and optical data we can not find any good optical\nidentification for this source. Most likely the diffuse source NS is part of the\noverall large-scale radio filament.\nNear the weaker northern radio source NN, an E/S0 galaxy (G3) of magnitude mv = 18.19 could be located at R.A. 23h 43m 40s .4, Dec. +00\u25e6 20\u2032 54\u2032\u2032 ,\npoitioned only 1.7 arcsec east from the FIRST radio peak. Due to its close\nproximity and consistent photometric colours (for redshift z\u2248 0.3), we consider it to be a possible candidate host galaxy/AGN for the origin of northern\nradio peak. At present the true relationship of this weak radio peak with the\nrest of the extended diffuse emission found with NVSS and 320 MHz data is\nnot very clear. The NVSS map shows an extension of about 2 arcmin size to\nthe west of the radio peak, whereas the 320 MHz map shows both this extension as well as another 'plume' to the east of radio peak NN. We consider two\npossibilities: first, that the optical galaxy G3 (with a weak radio nucleus) is\njust superposed on the rest of the radio filament which is not directly related\nto this galaxy. This possibility can not be ruled out from the present data.\nSecond, that this galaxy is the source of all the radio emission in the region of\nthe source NN. If this is true then can this radio source be a 'head-tail' type\nradio galaxy commonly found in clusters ? This interpretation is not fully\n1400\nsupported by radio spectral index \u03b1320\n= \u22120.47 \u00b1 0.20 as reported in Table 2.\nThe spectral index is quite flat for a head-tail radio source which generally\nhave their integrated spectral indices quite steep . \u22120.7. On the other hand\nthe fairly flat spectral index of -0.47 is consistent with the similar flat radio\nspectra noted over the other regions of the radio filament (Table 2). In that\ncase the radio spectral evidence suggests that both the northern sources NN\nand NS could be local regions of stronger emission embedded within the large\nradio filament. The cause could be that the physical conditions differ from\nplace to place within the filament, with local effects on particle acceleration\n12\n\n\fwhich then is reflected in the intensity of radio emission.\nApart from this possible radio source, no other optical galaxy could be identified with any part of the extended diffuse radio emission mapped by the\nVLA at 20 and 90 cm wavelengths. Therefore, given the evidence at hand, we\nconsider it to be unlikely that a major part of the large-scale radio structure\nis due to the blend of radio-galaxies in the cluster or in the background. It\nis very likely that the radio emission originates entirely in the diffuse intracluster medium and derives its power from an energetic process spread across\na region several Mpc wide.\n\n4.3 The meter-wavelength 320 MHz VLA image and spectral indices\n\nThe field of ZwCl 2341.1+0000 was further observed by the VLA on May 12,\n2000 at 327 MHz (\u03bb = 90 cm) for a total on-source duration of 2.2 hr. The\ncompact C-array observation was obtained with an aim to achieving resolution\nand large-scale structural mapping sensitivity comparable to the NVSS data.\nThe two IFs (intermediate frequencies) were centered at 327.5 MHz (IF1) and\n321.5 MHz (IF2) with bandwidths of 3.12 MHz in each IF. The data were\nobtained in spectral-line mode and amplitude (flux density) calibration was\nobtained by boot-strapping to 3C 48 which was assumed to have a flux density\nof 42.547 Jy and 42.966 Jy at IF 1 and 2 respectively. The 327.5 MHz data was\nfound to be heavily contaminated by radio interference and therefore could not\nbe used. The quality of 321.5 MHz data was found to be satisfactory and it\nwas used for further analysis. For analysis we used the NRAO 'AIPS' package.\nLow-frequency radio imaging of faint sources is always challenging due to\nlarge primary beam area of antennae, resulting in detection of many strong\nsources over this area. In addition, the effects of sky-curvature can not be\nneglected in mapping and cleaning of fields measuring several degrees in size.\nIn order to mitigate these problems as much as possible, we used the task\n'IMAGR' that permits the 'faceted' wide-field mapping and cleaning option.\nWe mapped upto 53 small fields (facets) centered on strong sources located a\npriori within the 5.6 \u00d7 5.6 deg2 field of view centered on ZwCl 2341.1+0000,\nand then simultaneously cleaned the entire set. At the end of cleaning cycle\nthe clean components from all facets together were restored back onto a single\nfield to generate a large wide-field image. We point out that due to the use\nof separate tangent point for each field, 3-D imaging, and the subtraction of\nclean components from un-gridded data (preventing aliasing of side-lobes),\nthe quality of the final clean image is fairly good. In order to emphasise the\nlarge-scale features and supress the oscillations in the side-lobes, the visibility\ndata were tapered by a Gaussian that had 30% weight at the 2 k\u03bb length\nof the interferometric spacing. This has resulted in better detection of faint\n13\n\n\fdiffuse features, but at the cost of angular resolution which is now 108 arcsec\nFWHM (circular Gaussian) on the radio map shown in Fig. 9 . The level\nof background noise on the cleaned image is about 2.5 mJy/beam r.m.s. as\nagainst 1.3 mJy/beam expected from pure thermal noise. This about factor\n2 higher noise is mainly the effect of residual low-level side-lobes of several\nstrong sources of 0.2 Jy-1.5 Jy flux density occuring nearby that limit the\ndynamic range achievable to \u2248 400.\nIn order to facilitate a comparison of the radio maps at 320 MHz and NVSS\nmap at 1400 MHz, we also show two wide-field images covering identical\n1.5 \u00d7 1.5 deg2 fields. The contour levels shown are in multiples of \u223c 1\u03c3\nnoise on each map. For a better comparison, the original NVSS map has\nbeen convolved with a Gaussian to obtain a broader final beam size of 90 \u00d7\n90 arcsec2 . These images can be accessed on-line by linking to this address\n(http://www.iucaa.ernet.in/ joydeep/vla/).\nComparison of 90 cm radio map (Fig. 9) with the 20 cm map (Fig. 6) reveals\nthe detection of all the features present on the 20 cm map, albeit at a coarser\nresolution. Furthermore, starting from radio source NN (in the northern half of\n20 cm image) and extending \u2248 5 arcmin to its east, an excess region of diffuse\nemission can be detected at 90 cm. This can be found at R.A. \u2248 23h 44m 03s ,\nand Dec. \u2248 00\u25e6 22\u203200\u2032\u2032 . Although the reality of features detected both at 20 cm\nand 90 cm are not in any doubt, we nevertheless introduce a caveat on the\nexcess diffuse radio feature. Although the \u223c 1 h\u22121\n50 Mpc sized 'plume' to the\neast of radio peak NN does suggest some connection, but it is quite faint and\ndetected at the significance level of about 2\u03c3 (surface brightness \u2248 5 mJy/b)\nonly. Therefore it must be treated with due caution. The two radio peaks of\ndiffuse emisiion, further towards east, that also seem to be linked with the\nplume, are somewhat better detected at the levels of 3\u03c3 (peak 7.7 mJy/b)\nand 5.6\u03c3 (peak 14 mJy/b). But due to faint nature of these radio structures,\nthey should also be treated with caution until confirmed with stronger signal\nin an improved observation. In case these features are real, they would make\nthe total radio size much larger than what is visible at 20 cm wavelength (see\nbelow).\nThe optical morphology of galaxies underlying the 90 cm extended structure\nis shown in Fig. 10, where the radio contours are shown superposed on the\nPalomar DSS-2 red sensitive photograph. From this image, and also from the\nhigher resolution 'FIRST' radio data discussed above, no galaxy was found to\nbe apparently associated with any region of the diffuse radio structure.\nThe largest observed angular size at 90 cm is about 12 arcmin, which corresponds to a projected dimension of \u2248 4 h\u22121\n50 Mpc. The size when measured\nalong the spine of the filamentary structure was found to be about 6 h\u22121\n50 Mpc,\nthus making it comparable or larger than some of the largest known radio\n14\n\n\fstructures in the Universe: the giant radio galaxies 3C236 (5.8 h\u22121\n50 Mpc) and\n\u22121\nNVSS 2146+82 (3.9 h50 Mpc) (Strom & Willis 1980, Palma et al. 2000), and\nalso the largest known radio-loud quasar HE 1127-1304 (2.4 h\u22121\n50 Mpc; Bhatnagar et al. (1998)). However, there is no evidence available to show that the\nradio emission in any way constitutes a giant radio galaxy (see \u00a7 4.4 below).\nA peculiar radio morphology and the pronounced lack of symmetry in the\nobserved structure are particularly noticeable in this source.\nThe extended region was detected at a significance level of 2\u20135\u03c3. Therefore, for\nthe extended part, the radio spectral index is steep (\u03b1 < \u22120.9), estimated from\nits non-detection at 20 cm to the flux density limit of 10 mJy. Estimates of flux\ndensities and the spectral indices for the various regions of the radio structure\nare listed in Table 2. The overall negative spectral indices in all regions (\u03b1 .\n\u22120.5) indicate a non-thermal mechanism for radio emission, most likely the\nsynchrotron radiation of relativistic charges accelerated in a magnetic field.\nTherefore it is necessary that both the particles and fields, distributed on\nsimilar spatial scales, should be present to generate the radio emission. To our\nknowledge, this is the first observational evidence of distribution of particles\nand magnetic fields on spatial scales & 5 h\u22121\n50 Mpc.\n\n4.4 On the possibility of radio source in ZwCl 2341.1+0000 being a giant\nradio-galaxy\n\nThe so-called giant radio-galaxies (GRGs) are a rare class of largest radio\nsources whose projected linear size between the radio lobes is & 1 Mpc. Their\nother physical characteristics are that they are mostly bi-symmetric, have\nedge-brightened FR-II (Fanaroff-Riley class II) radio morphology. Their radio\npower is in the transition zone between FR-I (low-powered systems) and FR-II\n(high-powered ones). Furthermore, they tend to occur in regions of both low\ngalaxy density and low intergalactic matter density. In view of the extremely\nlarge size noted for the radio source in ZwCl 2341.1+0000, we ask\u2013 can it be\nanother GRG?\nWe have several pieces of evidence which seem to rule out this possibility. First,\nthe radio morphology is very peculiar, lacking any semblance of bi-modal or\nother symmetry or identifiable radio-jets or large-scale radio-lobes as expected\nof GRGs. Second, on the high resolution 'FIRST' map we do not find any\nevidence of a compact radio core associated with a centrally located optical\ngalaxy which could be assumed to be the source of the entire radio structure.\nThird, the projected linear size in the range 4\u20136 Mpc is very large even by\nthe standards of GRGs. Schoenmakers et al. (2001), in their systematic study\nof several GRGs found that beyond the linear size of 2 Mpc the number of\nGRGs cuts-off sharply and sources above this size are extremely rare. There\n15\n\n\fappears to be a strong luminosity evolution in the GRG population, such that\nin the majority of them the activity in the central engine is extinguished over\nthe time it takes for the radio-lobes to expand to size & 2 Mpc. Therefore, the\nextreme size of the present radio source and its morphological peculiarities\nsuggest that it is not powered by the energy outpouring in the expanding\nradio lobes. Some other energy generation mechanism spread over the entire\nradio structure appears to be at work here. We show below that possibly\nthis is diffusive shock acceleration in structure formation flows. It is therefore\nunlikely that ZwCl 2341.1+0000 is a giant radio-galaxy.\n\n5\n\nX-ray detection in the ROSAT All-sky survey\n\nAn X-ray counterpart of the collapsing filament ZwCl 2341.1+0000 can be\nfound in the ROSAT all-sky survey () (http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/cgi-bin/rosat/rosat-survey/\nAlmost the entire sky was surveyed by the PSPC-C instrument on ROSAT in\nscanning mode over six months in 1990, such that every point in the sky was\nobserved with an effective exposure time of between 117 and 443.9 seconds.\nFig. 11 shows the RASS observation, smoothed with a Gaussian of \u03c3r = 4\npixel \u223c 1 arcmin, as contours superposed on the optical (Palomar DSS-2 red)\nimage. We have used only the 0.5-2 keV band of the observations to produce\nthe image, since the softer band shows no significant signal in this region\n(higher background). The r.m.s. level of background noise on the smoothed\nimage is typically 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 counts/s, which was estimated over several nearby\nregions. The first contour is shown at the level of about 4 \u03c3 (21\u00d710\u22123 counts/s)\nand next contours are spaced linearly in steps of 1 \u03c3. The highest X-ray peak\n(45.9 \u00d7 10\u22123 counts/s, 9\u03c3 detection) in this region is at R.A. 23h 43m 39.6s ,\nDec +00\u25e619\u2032 40.3\u2032\u2032 (J2000). The secondary peak (37.7 \u00d7 10\u22123 counts/s, 7.5\u03c3\ndetection) is at R.A. 23h 43m 44.4s , Dec +00\u25e615\u2032 08\u2032\u2032 . The positional accuracy\nof the X-ray data was checked with respect to the optically identified point\nX-ray sources in the field and was found to be \u2248 15 arcsec as expected of the\nRASS (Voges et al. 1999).\nThe net flux in the 0.1\u20132.4 keV band in the region shown in Fig. 11 is\n2.52 \u00d710\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 (\u00b143%), corresponding to a 3\u03c3 detection. A galactic\nneutral hydrogen column of 3.7 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 was assumed (Dickey & Lockman\n1990), and no k-correction was applied (< 10%). We assumed a gas temperature of T = 5 keV in the calculation. At redshift z = 0.3, this flux corresponds\n\u22121\nto bremsstrahlung X-ray luminosity of 1.1 \u00d7 1044 h\u22122\n50 erg s . The largest angular size of the detected X-ray structure is about 8 arcmin (2.6 h\u22121\n50 Mpc),\ncomparable to the size of the radio structure. The structure of the X-ray source\nappears quite non-relaxed, which suggests that this system is possibly undergoing a violent gravitational merger of subclusters. Therefore the ROSAT data\n16\n\n\fsupports the possibility that ZwCl 2341.1+0000 is in fact a systen undergoing structure formation. This is a likely scenario in view of the filamentary\nmorphology of galaxies noted in optical.\nAlthough the RASS detection is not strong enough in order to provide firm\ninferences, we nevertheless show a spatial comparison between the radio and\nX-ray emitting plasma by superposing the 327 MHz radio image and the X-ray\ncontours in Fig. 12. Here we can locate the stronger northern X-ray structure\nin the northern part of the radio filament while the secondary X-ray peak to\nthe south is in the vicinity of the southern diffuse radio structure and both\nseem to be joined by an X-ray filament/bridge of \u223c 2.2 arcmin (730 h\u22121\n50 kpc)\nsize (\u2248 27 \u00d7 10\u22123 counts/s or 5.4\u03c3 detection). We note a strong curvature in\nthe main filament of galaxies located about 1.5 arcmin to the east of this X-ray\nbridge (Fig. 11). This pattern is also visible on the 20 cm radio and optical\nsuperposition shown in Fig. 6. Another extended X-ray filament/plume of \u223c 3\narcmin ( 900 h\u22121\n50 kpc) size, and detected at the 4 \u2212 6 \u03c3 level, can be found to\nthe east of the northern X-ray peak where several smaller filaments join with\nthe larger main filament of galaxies. Interestingly, both the X-ray peaks as well\nas the filaments are apparently displaced from the nearby radio peaks (by as\nmuch as 1 to 1.5 arcmin - significantly larger than the X-ray positional error).\nWhile this clearly indicates that the X-ray emission mechanism can not be the\nnon-thermal inverse Compton radiation, however it can provide a diagnostic\ntool to probe the physics of the multi-phase (thermal and non-thermal) intracluster medium in comparison with the structure formation simulation results.\nA similar strong mismatch between the locations of relativistic and thermal\nplasma is noticeable in the numerical simulation carried out by us in \u00a7 8. We\ndefer the discussion on it's physical significance to \u00a7 8 where it will be dealt\nwith in comparison with the theoretical model.\n\n6\n\nThe large-scale environment\n\nThe linear dimensions of the optical and radio structures described here, although quite large, are both restricted by the maximum possible areas that\ncould be imaged with the optical and radio telescopes used. We have no reason to believe that these are not parts of a larger super-structure, which needs\nto be verified for its important implications. As of now, neither deep widefield optical images nor extensive redshift measurements are available in order\nto check whether or not this concentration of galaxies visible in the region\nof ZwCl 2341.1+0000 is part of a larger supercluster (\u223c10\u2013100 Mpc) scale\nstructure.\nAs a step in this direction, we have used the Palomar DSS-2 survey images and\nthe NASA Extragalactic Database NED (http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu)\n17\n\n\fto search for other known clusters and groups within a radius of 2 deg (40 h\u22121\n50\nMpc) of the center. There are eight identified galaxy concentrations which are\nlisted in Table 3. The two nearest clusters, Abell 2644 and RXC J2341.1+0018,\nare at much lower redshifts to be associated with ZwCl 2341.1+0000. The other\nfive Zwicky clusters, situated within 40\u201375 arcmin, are of comparable richness,\nbut their redshifts are not known. However, there is a very rich cluster Abell\n2631 (richness class 3, z = 0.2730), which is only 1.5 degree (30 h\u22121\n50 Mpc) away\non the sky and at a comparable redshift, making it a possible association\non a super-cluster scale. Deep wide-field imaging and spectroscopy of a large\narea in the ZwCl 2341.1+0000 region could reveal the true supercluster-scale\nenvironment of this large forming structure.\nTable 3\nLarge scale environment: known groups and clusters within 2 degrees\n(40 h\u22121\n50 Mpc )\nCluster or group\n\nR.A.\n\nDec.\n\nJ(2000)\n\nJ(2000)\n\n(arcmin)\n\nZwCl 2341.1+0000\n\n23h 43m 39.7s\n\n+00\u25e6 16\u2032 39\u2032\u2032 \u223c0.30\n\n0.0\n\nRXC J2341.1+0018\n\n23 41 06.3\n\n+00 18 53\n\n0.110\n\n38.4\n\nAbell 2644\n\n23 41 09.8\n\n+00 05 38\n\n0.069\n\n39.1\n\nZwCl 2338.3-0022\n\n23 40 51.8\n\n\u201300 05 22\n\n...\n\n47.4\n\nZwCl 2343.9+0029\n\n23 46 27.7\n\n+00 45 40\n\n...\n\n51.0\n\nZwCl 2342.2+0049\n\n23 44 45.7\n\n+01 05 40\n\n...\n\n51.7\n\nZwCl 2344.9-0025\n\n23 47 27.8\n\n\u201300 08 20\n\n...\n\n62.2\n\nZwCl 2345.7+0030\n\n23 48 15.7\n\n+00 46 41\n\n...\n\n75.2\n\nAbell 2631\n\n23 37 39.7\n\n+00 17 37\n\n0.273\n\n90.0\n\n7\n\nRedshift\n\nSeparation\n\nEvidence of particle acceleration in shock waves associated with\nlarge-scale structure formation\n\n7.1 The necessity of a large-scale particle acceleration process\n\nThe radiative life-time (tlife) of a relativistic electron in a weak magnetic field\n(\u223c 10\u22127 G) is dominated by inverse Compton loss (IC), and it is given by\n6\n\ntlife = 80.36 \u00d7 10 yr\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b3\n104\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\n7\n\n= 4.1 \u00d7 10 yr\n18\n\n\u0012\n\nEe\nGeV\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\n\fwhere Ee is the electron energy, \u03b3 is the electron Lorentz factor and the redshift\nis assumed to be z = 0.3. At the strongly turbulent magnetic field environment\nnear the sites of particle acceleration (e.g., shocks), the diffusion may be governed by the Bohm approximation, in which the diffusion coefficient is (e.g.,\nDrury (1983))\n\u03baBohm = 3.31 \u00d7 1023\n\n\u0012\n\nEe\nGeV\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\nB\n10\u22127 G\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\ncm2 s\u22121 .\n\n(2)\n\nTherefore, the diffusion length-scale (Ldiff ) for an electron within the inverse\nCompton radiative cooling life-time tlife is\nLdiff = (\u03baBohm * tlife)\n\n1/2\n\n= 6.7\n\n\u0012\n\nB\n10\u22127 G\n\n\u0013\u2212 12\n\npc.\n\n(3)\n\nThe linear size of the observed radio emission Lradio is about several Mpc which\nis much bigger than Ldif f . Therefore, electrons once accelerated in a localized\npoint source such as a radio galaxy or AGN and diffusively transported cannot\nbe the source of the large-scale radio emission. The discrepancy between the\nBohm diffusion length-scale and the radio structure size is so large, that even\nin the case of ordered magnetic fields, where diffusion should be more effective\n(than in the Bohm approximation), electrons are still unable to cross the\nemission region within a radiative life-time.\nFurthermore, we have not found any evidence of radio jets originating at a\ncentral nucleus and transporting bulk kinetic energy to large distances in expanding radio-lobes. Therefore, it is required that the particles (electrons)\nmust be accelerated in situ, and the acceleration mechanism should be such\nthat it is extended over scales of several Mpc, and long-lived over the dynamical time-scale tdyn \u223c 109 y. In addition, they are required to be energetic\nenough to rapidly achieve relativistic energies on an acceleration time-scale tacc\nsuch that tacc < tlife < tdyn . We show below that the diffusive shock acceleration associated with the formation of large-scale structure ZwCl 2341.1+0000\nis the most viable mechanism in operation.\n\n7.2 Energetics of shock acceleration and estimates of the magnetic field strengths\ninvolved\nThe extremely large linear size for the radio structure, its peculiar radio morphology unlike any radio galaxy, and its association with this striking optical filament of galaxies, suggest to us that we are possibly witnessing a\nnew and hitherto unknown type of radio phenomenon. The NVSS VLA map\n19\n\n\fhas a central surface brightness of S1.4GHz \u2248 5.5 mJy/arcmin2 for the diffuse emission of the source ZwCl 2341.1+0000 (1 mJy = 10\u221229 W Hz\u22121 m\u22122 ).\nFrom radio data, a power-law radio-frequency spectrum with spectral index\n\u03b1 \u223c \u22120.5 is found in the diffuse parts. Assuming this to be the spectral index\nacross the radio frequency range \u03bd1 = 10 MHz to \u03bd2 = 10 GHz, the representative radio surface-brightness of this structure can be estimated to be\nQradio = 1.6 \u00d7 1042 erg s\u22121 Mpc\u22122 . Any possible acceleration mechanism should\nbe energetic enough in producing this order of radio brightness over the entire\nfilament.\nThe mechanism for the radio emission is very likely to be the synchrotron\nradiation of relativistic charges accelerated in a magnetic field, and therefore\nthe presence of a magnetic field energy is necessary. To obtain an estimate of\nthe field strength in the observed structure, we minimize the total non-thermal\nenergy density, required to produce the observed radio emission, with respect\nto the magnetic field and write for the minimum energy field [which is close\nto the equipartition field, (Miley 1980)],\n\"\n\n3/2\n\nBme = 0.35 \u03b7 sin\n\n\u03c6\n\nd\nMpc\n\n!#\u2212 2\n7\n\n\u03bcG.\n\n(4)\n\nHere, we have tacitly assumed an energy ratio of protons to electrons equal\nto unity, and \u03b1 = \u22120.5. For a range of volume filling factor \u03b7= 1\u20130.5, and\nthe angle of field lines relative to line of sight \u03c6 = 90\u201345 deg, our estimated\nfield spans the range Bme = 0.5\u20130.3 \u03bcG, assuming a cylindrical geometry with\nobserved length = 3.3 Mpc (10 arcmin), width = 1 Mpc (3 arcmin), and\nassumed depth d = 1 Mpc, consistent with the morphology of the filament as\nobserved at 20 cm. The calculated minimum energy field Bme depends weakly\non source geometry, the nonthermal spectral index, and the frequency range\nof the synchrotron radiation, usually taken to be 0.01-100 GHz.\nIt is more likely, however, that the emission comes from a thin layer close to\nthe accretion shock surface. This implies a much smaller filling factor. If we\nassume that \u03b7 = 0.01 and \u03c6 = 90\u201345 deg, the magnetic field obtained is in\nrange Bme = 1.3 \u2212 1.5 \u03bcG. The radiative age of the 1.4 GHz radio-emitting\nelectrons, undergoing inverse Compton and synchrotron emission losses, is\nthen only . 50 Myr.\nThe diffuse radio emission from a region several Mpc across can only originate\nin a powerful energy source of a similar size. To our knowledge, only the\nexpected accretion flow of inter-galactic matter onto the filament is sufficiently\nextended, long-lived, and energetic to overcome the radiation losses of the\nrelativistic electrons over a Mpc-scale filament. The exact physical mechanism\nof the electron acceleration is yet to be revealed. It is logical to assume, from\nits filamentary structure and high redshift, that ZwCl 2341.1+0000 is evolving\n20\n\n\ftowards, but is still far from becoming, a centrally condensed galaxy cluster.\nThe accretion shocks associated to forming structures are typically strong,\nwith Mach numbers, M \u223c 5 \u2212 10, as opposed to the weaker merger shocks\nwhich typically have M \u223c 2 (Miniati et al. 2000). This makes them ideal\nsites for high energy particle production. Diffuse regions of large-scale radio\nemission, commonly known as 'radio relics' and 'radio halos', and the detection\nof temperature structure in several nearby galaxy clusters are possibly related\nto such shocks (Willson 1970, Kim et al. 1989, Feretti & Giovannini 1996, Deiss\net al. 1997, Bagchi, Pislar, & Lima Neto 1998, Lima Neto, Pislar & Bagchi\n2001, Ensslin et al. 1998, Giovannini, Tordi, & Feretti 1999, Ensslin & GopalKrishna 2001, Miniati et al. 2001b, Ensslin & Br\u00fcggen 2002). However, no such\nevidences have hitherto been found in supercluster-scale filamentary structures\nat high redshifts.\nWe propose here that the large-scale radio emission and magnetic field detected in ZwCl 2341.1+0000 are strong evidences for diffusive shock-acceleration\n(Bell 1978, Blandford & Ostriker 1978) of particles in structure formation flows\n(Ensslin et al. 1998, Miniati et al. 2001b). A natural consequence of this process\nwould be a power-law spectrum of the momentum distribution. The acceleration process giving rise to a pool of high-energy cosmic-ray particles (both\nelectrons and protons), and specifically the radio emission tracing the radiation from energetic electrons interacting with the magnetic fields. The inverse\nCompton scatter of cosmic microwave background photons from accelerated\nelectrons may also generate a detectable hard X-ray flux from the structure\n(e.g., Bagchi, Pislar, & Lima Neto (1998)).\nWe test the viability of the suggested mechanism by showing that the available kinetic power in the accretion flows in this galaxy filament is sufficient to\nexplain the observed radio luminosity and the unobserved inverse Compton\nradiation. For this, we consider a simplified model of the filament. The main\nstructure is described as an infinite extended, linear, self-gravitating, isothermal cold dark matter (CDM) filament. The radial profile of the dark matter\nmass distribution is\n\u033aCDM (r) = \u033aCDM,o\n\nr2\n1+ 2\n8 rscale\n\n\"\n\n#\u22122\n\n,\n\nwhere r is the radius, and rscale = \u03c3CDM /(4 \u03c0 G \u033aCDM,o )1/2 is the typical scale\nof the dark matter distribution which has a central density of \u033aCDM,o and a\n1-dim. velocity dispersion of \u03c3CDM . G is the gravitational constant.\nThe observed galaxies can be regarded as test particles since they do not\nsignificantly affect the gravitational potential of the dark matter. Since the\ngalaxies are expected to have a smaller velocity dispersion \u03c3gal than the dark\nmatter, we assume a conservative velocity bias of bv = \u03c3gal /\u03c3CDM \u2248 0.8 (Carl21\n\n\fberg, Couchman & Thomas 1990). This leads to a spatially more concentrated\nprofile for the galaxies\n\u033agal (r) = \u033agal,o\n\n\"\n\nr2\n1+ 2\n8 rscale\n\n#\u22122/b2v\n\n.\n\nWe estimate that the visible diameter of the filament of roughly Dgal = 100\narcsec corresponds to the region where the projected galaxy density is above\n30% of the central value, which implies Dgal \u2248 4 rscale . As shown in \u00a7 3.2, the\nobserved average V -band luminosity of the filament of galaxies is estimated\nto be 2.7 \u00d7 1011 L\u2299 /arcmin2 . For a central mass to light ratio of M/LV = 100,\nthis translates into a central dark matter mass density of \u033aCDM,o = 4.5 \u00d7\n10\u221226 g cm\u22123 cos \u03b8. Here, \u03b8 is the (unknown) angle of the filament axis and\nthe normal to sky-plane, which we assume in the following to be \u03b8 = 45\u25e6 . The\nvelocity dispersion of the dark matter can then be estimated to be \u03c3CDM \u2248 690\nkm/s.\nThe estimated high central density and high velocity dispersion of this galaxy\nfilament are comparable to that of a small galaxy cluster.\u221aThe velocity of\nthe in-falling matter should reach a final velocity of vin = 3 \u03c3CDM = 1200\nkm/s, in order to provide the velocity dispersion of the filament. This estimate of high velocity of infall is in accord with previous estimates based on\nhydrodynamic simulations (e.g., Ryu & Kang (1997)), and with those derived\ntheoretically (e.g., Bertschinger (1985)). The characteristic incident velocities\nare us \u2248 103 km s\u22121 [(Mcl /Rcl )/(4 \u00d7 1014 M\u2299 /Mpc)]1/2 in accretion shocks\naround clusters of galaxies of given mass-to-radius ratio Mcl /Rcl .\nWe now estimate the rate of dissipation of kinetic energy by the accretion shock\n3\n. We assume\nover the surface area of the filament, given by Qkin = 21 \u033agas,in vin\nthe infalling low density baryonic gas to have a proton number density nP =\n10\u22125 cm\u22123 , corresponding to the mass density of \u033agas,in = 1.67 \u00d7 10\u221229 g cm\u22123\n(i.e., \u033agas,in /\u033acrit = 3.55). This gives Qkin = 1.4 \u00d7 1044 erg s\u22121 Mpc\u22122 , which is\nsufficient to provide an integrated (over the radio spectrum) radio brightness\nQradio \u2248 1.6 \u00d7 1042 erg s\u22121 Mpc\u22122 even if this kinetic power is converted to\nradiative energy with an efficiency of \u2248 1%.\nIn addition, this kinetic power allows for the low general efficiency of the diffusive shock-acceleration process (\u223c 10%) and cooling due to inverse Compton\nradiation QIC = 10.5 Qradio (B/\u03bcG)\u22122 (1+z)4 . Therefore, balancing the energy\ngain by Qkin with the losses in the energy-budget, we obtain an upper limit to\nthe inverse Compton loss QIC < 1.4 \u00d7 1044 erg s\u22121 Mpc\u22122 and a lower limit to\nthe allowed magnetic field strength in the inter-galactic medium B & 0.56 \u03bcG.\nWe note that even lower values of the magnetic field strength are allowed if the\navailable kinetic power is higher than estimated here, either due to a higher\ninfalling mass density or a larger velocity of the accretion flow.\n22\n\n\fFollowing Drury (1983), the mean acceleration time scale for electrons to reach\na given energy is\ntacc\n\n8\n= 2 \u03baBohm = 8.36\nus\n\n\u0012\n\nEe\nGeV\n\n\u0013 \u0012\n\nB\n10\u22127 G\n\n\u0013\u22121 \u0012\n\nus\n3\n10 km s\u22121\n\n\u0013\u22122\n\nyr,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere us is the shock speed. Here we have taken the limit of strong shock, so\nthe downstream speed u2 is related to upstream speed u1 by u2 = u1 /4, and\n\u03ba/u = constant. For the diffusion coefficient, once more the Bohm diffusion\ncondition \u03ba = \u03baBohm is invoked. Clearly, tacc \u226a tlife, so in comparison to the\nradiative loss time scale, the acceleration process is virtually instantaneous.\nAlso, the acceleration time-scale is much shorter compared to the expected life\ntime of shocks tacc \u226a tshock (\u223c 109 y). Under these conditions, the maximum\nenergy attained by electrons in the acceleration process can be calculated by\nsetting the acceleration and cooling times equal (tacc = tlife), which gives\nEe,max \u2248 2.2\n\n\u0012\n\nB\n10\u22127 G\n\n\u00131/2 \u0012\n\nus\n103 km s\u22121\n\n\u0013\n\nTeV.\n\n(6)\n\nProtons are expected to achieve even higher energies due to their far less\nradiative losses. Thus the cosmological accretion shocks in large-scale forming structures such as ZwCl 2341.1+0000 are indeed capable of accelerating\nparticles to very high energies.\n\n8\n\nComparison with a numerical model\n\n8.1 Description of simulations\nIn order to investigate the nature of radio emission and magnetic field presented in \u00a7 4 & \u00a7 7.2, we carried out a specific numerical simulation of largescale structure formation that, in addition to the the dark matter and the\nbaryonic components, also follows a passive magnetic field and the cosmic-ray\nelectrons (CREs). In the following we briefly describe the technique employed\nfor the treatment of each of these components.\nFor the cosmological part we have used an Eulerian, grid based Total-VariationDiminishing hydro + N-body cosmology code (Ryu et al. 1993). We have\nadopted a commonly favored \u039b + cold dark matter model with the following parameters: total mass density \u03a9m = 0.3, vacuum energy density\n\u03a9\u039b = 1 \u2212 \u03a9m = 0.7, baryonic mass fraction \u03a9b = 0.04, and normalized Hubble\nconstant h50 = 1.34 (i.e., H0 = 67 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ). The initial density perturbations were distributed as a Gaussian random field with a power spectrum\n23\n\n\fcharacterized by a spectral index n = 1 and \"cluster\" normalization \u03c38 = 0.9.\nThe dark matter component is described by 1283 particles, whereas the gas\ncomponent is evolved on a grid of 2563 cells. We chose a comoving size for\nthe simulation box Lbox = 100h\u22121\n50 Mpc. Such a size should be large enough to\nallow the formation of groups and small clusters of galaxies with temperatures\nup to a few keV.\nWith the above set up, the size of a computational cell corresponds to about\n8 \u22121\n400 h\u22121\n50 kpc, a dark matter particle mass to about 8.5\u00d710 h50 M\u2299 , and the spatial and mass resolution to a few times these values respectively. The adopted\nresolution is somewhat modest. However, it is higher than that characterizing\nthe radio observations. In addition, our tests indicate that coarse grid effects\ndo not affect the simulated electrons and their corresponding radio emission\ntoo significantly, which are the primary objectives here.\nThe magnetic field is treated as a passive quantity, in the sense that its dynamical role on the fluid behavior is completely neglected. The initial magnetic\nfield is set to zero but magnetic field seeds are generated at shocks in accord\nto the Biermann battery mechanism (Biermann 1950). The field strength is\nthereafter enhanced by shear flow through stretching and by field compression (Kulsrud et al. 1997). However, even at the end of the simulation, the\nmagnetic field within collapsed structures is well below observational values\n[see Kulsrud et al. (1997) for further details]. For this reason, the overall field\nstrength normalization is arbitrary. Nevertheless, the simulation will provide\nimportant information about the topology and the relative strength of the\nmagnetic field in different regions of the flow.\nFinally, the evolution of the CREs is computed by means of the numerical code\nCOSMOCR (Miniati 2001, Miniati 2002). The code is fully described in the\ngiven references and here we shall only briefly summarize the salient aspects\nof it. We suppose that CREs are only injected at shocks from the thermal\nplasma and we neglect the contribution from any other source (e.g., secondary\nelectrons produced in inelastic p-p collisions, or injected from radio-galaxies).\nThe injection at shocks is parametrized in the following way. We compute\nthe fraction of injected cosmic-ray protons according to the 'thermal leakage'\nmodel [e.g., Kang & Jones (1995)], and assume a fixed value Re/p for the ratio\nof CREs to protons at relativistic energies. This simplified approach, after\nEllison, Berezhko, & Baring (2000), is motivated by the fact that the physics\nunderlying the injection at shocks of primary electrons is very complex and not\nwell understood. Observational evidence suggests that this ratio is in the range\n0.01-0.05 for the Galactic CRs (Mueller & Tang 1987, Mueller et al. 1995).\nWith the parameters assumed for our 'thermal leakage' model, the fraction\nof the thermal protons passing through shocks and injected as cosmic-rays is\n\u223c 10\u22124 [see Miniati (2001) for details].\n24\n\n\fAfter their injection at shocks as described above, the CREs are evolved taking\ninto account both spatial transport and energy losses/gains. This is achieved\nby solving numerically a Fokker-Planck equation that has been integrated\nover finite momentum bins. Basically, momentum space is divided into Np\nlogarithmically equidistant intervals, referred to as momentum bins. The electron distribution function f (p\u0302), as a function of the normalized momentum\np\u0302 \u2261 p/me c, in each spatial cell and for each momentum bin is approximated\nby the following piece-wise power law:\nf (xi , p\u0302) = fj (xi ) p\u0302\u2212qj (xi ) ,\n\n1 < p\u0302j\u22121 \u2264 p\u0302 \u2264 p\u0302j ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere fj (xi ) and qj (xi ) are the number normalization and logarithmic slope\nfor a given cell and p\u0302 bin. With the above definition, the number density of\nparticles is given by dN = 4 \u03c0 p\u03022 f (p\u0302)dp\u0302.\nWithin each momentum bin j, and at each spatial grid point xi , we follow the\ntotal number density and kinetic energy density of the CREs, defined as\n\nn(xi , p\u0302j ) = 4\u03c0\n\np\u0302Zj+1\n\nf (xi , p\u0302)p\u03022 dp\u0302\n\n(8)\n\n\u03b5(xi , p\u0302j ) = 4\u03c0\n\np\u0302Zj+1\n\nf (xi , p\u0302)T (p\u0302)p\u03022 dp\u0302,\n\n(9)\n\np\u0302j\n\np\u0302j\n\nwhere T (p\u0302) = (\u03b3 \u2212 1)me c2 is the relativistic kinetic energy. Further, for\neach momentum bin, qj (xi ) is determined self-consistently from the values\nof n(xi , p\u0302j ) and \u03b5(xi , p\u0302j ) defined above [see Miniati (2001) for details]. With\nthis formalism, the evolution of n(xi , p\u0302j ) in momentum space is described by\nthe equation\nh\nip\u0302j\n\u2202n(xi , p\u0302j )\n+ Q(xi , p\u0302j ),\n= \u2212\u2207 * [u n(xi , p\u0302j )] + b(p\u0302) 4\u03c0 p\u03022 f (p\u0302)\np\u0302j\u22121\n\u2202t\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the first term on the right hand side describes advective transport and\nQ(xi , p\u0302j ) represents a source term, i(xi , p\u0302), integrated over the jth bin. Finally,\nb(p\u0302) \u2261 dp/dt describes mechanical and radiative loss terms [see Miniati (2001)\nfor further details]. For the energy range of interest here, the most effective\namong these are synchrotron and inverse Compton emission.\n25\n\n\f8.2 Simulation results and comparison with observations\n\nThe simulation data allow us to compute various quantities directly related to\nthe observations reported in \u00a7 4. Being interested in radio emission, we have\ncomputed the synchrotron emission from the simulated relativistic electrons\nand magnetic field distribution. We have then integrated the emissivity along\none of the coordinate axis of the computational box to create a radio map. In\ngeneral we find that shocks around large, massive structures such as groups and\nclusters, are relatively bright radio sources. A detailed, quantitative analysis\nof the properties of radio emission at cosmic shocks is presented in Miniati et\nal. (2001b).\nIn order to investigate the physical conditions of the cosmic environment where\nthe CREs are accelerated, we also have obtained analogous maps of inverse\nCompton hard X-ray (HXR) at 50 keV (from the same relativistic electrons\nresponsible for the radio emission) and of X-ray emission in the 0.5-2 keV\nband from thermal bremsstrahlung of the collapsed structures.\nA portion of size 10 Mpc comoving corresponding to the same structure from\neach of these maps is presented in Fig. 13. Here we show respectively ra\u22121\nJy pxl\u22121 ' (top left panel), X-ray from thermal\ndio emission in units of 'Re/p\nbremsstrahlung in units 'erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 pxl\u22121 ' (top right), and 50 keV HXR in\n\u22121\nerg s\u22121 cm\u22122 Hz\u22121 pxl\u22121 ' (bottom right). In these radio/Xunits '10\u221223 Re/p\nray units, 1 pxl is about 0.34 \u00d7 0.34 arcmin2 . In the bottom left panel we\nalso show 9 iso-contours of the radio emission,\nranging from 10\u22125.8 to 10\u22124.6\n\u221a\nand separated by constant factor of 100.15 = 2. We point out that the presence of Re/p in our radio and HXR units indicates explicitly the dependence\nof the computed amount of non-thermal emission on the assumed value for\nthis parameter. In addition, the non-thermal emission in the reported figures\ndepends on an assumed ionic energy injection efficiency of order 10% and a\nmagnetic field average strength of 1\u03bcG. Based on a comparison of the numerical and observational results, below we indicate slightly modified values (for\nthese quantities) that are required in order for us to reproduce the observed\ntotal radio emission. Given the resolution of the simulation and the putative\nredshift of the source, the original pixel size in the synthetic image was 0.\u2032 34.\nThus to better compare with the observational radio images, the value of the\nemission in the synthetic images has been averaged over a region corresponding to 3 \u00d7 3 pixels. The choice of this particular portion of the maps has the\nsole purpose of showing the typical morphological and emission properties of\na cosmic, supersonic accretion flow. We briefly discuss similarities between the\nobserved (Fig. 6 & Fig. 9) and simulated radio structures although we do not\nexpect matching between the two at any level. We notice that although the\ncontours in the synthetic radio map appear more elongated than in Fig. 6, this\nis particularly due to the use of much fainter contours in the former image.\n26\n\n\fOne feature of general interest concerns the relative location of the radio emission with respect to the thermal X-ray bright source, that is a group/cluster of\ngalaxies. In our synthetic radio map the brightest (southern) emission region\nis located in correspondence of an accretion shock and sort of drapes around\none side of an X-ray group/cluster. On the northern side of this X-ray structure a fainter extended radio source is also present. Some of the emission there\nis produced by acceleration regions associated to a smaller collapsing object\nthat happens to be on the same line of sight. Several more smaller and fainter\nX-ray clumps are also present here. In both cases however, one notes that the\nradio and thermal X-ray emitting regions do not overlap but are somewhat\ndisplaced with respect to each other.\nIn \u00a7 5 we have shown how this pattern is also present in the observational data\nand becomes visible when a superposition of the radio emission at 320 MHz\n(or 1.4 GHz) with the ROSAT X-ray map (Fig. 11) is carried out (Fig. 12).\nIt is particularly evident in the southern section of the observational images\nwhere the thermal X-ray peak lies shifted to the west from the diffuse regions\nof radio emission which appears to surround the X-ray region from north,\neast and south. The stronger X-ray peak to the north as well as the extended\nfilament to the south-east also do not have their exact radio correspondences,\nalthough radio peaks are present nearby within 1-5 arcmin. What physical\nprocess can produce such an effect ?\nThis is likely due to the fact that the radio emission possibly traces the peripheral regions of strong accretion shocks generating freshly accelerated relativistic particles. These are the regions at the interface between the externel IGM\nand ICM. In contrast, the bremsstrahlung X-rays come from interior regions of\ndeep gravitational potential wells in which shock heated and compressed gas\nis accumulating over cosmological time scales. Note that we can confirm this\npicture from the synthetic images where we can easily delineate the regions of\nnon-thermal and thermal emissions, and non-thermal emission does correlate\nspatially with strong shocks.\nThe maps shown in Fig. 13 were used to compute the total flux from radiosynchrotron and thermal bremsstrahlung emission to be compared with the\nobservational values. Given the radio and X-rays bremsstrahlung fluxes obtained from these plots, and the dependence of the radio flux from the properties of the underlying structure as derived in Miniati et al. (2001b), we have\nestimated the physical parameters characterizing our numerical model for the\nCR electrons and the size of the underlying structure required to reproduce\nthe measured radio flux. In addition, using the bottom right panel of Fig. 13,\nwe have also computed the expected HXR flux between 20 and 80 keV. In\nTable 4 we report each of these quantities and we also summarize the assumptions on shock acceleration efficiency and magnetic field strength before we\ndiscuss them below.\n27\n\n\fTable 4\nSimulation Results\nPCRE /Pram\n\n10\u22122\n\nB\n\nSsync (1.4 GHz)\n\nFHXR (20-80 keV)\n\nFXBR (0.5-2.0 keV)\n\n(\u03bcG)\n\n(mJy)\n\n(erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 )\n\n(erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 )\n\n1.5\n\n20-30\n\n4 \u00d7 10\u221213\n\n6\u00d710\u221213\n\nThe radio flux reported in the previous sections for ZwCl 2341.1+0000 is quite\nlarge given the redshift of this source. Nevertheless, according to the simulation results, a radio flux of a few \u00d710 mJy can be produced by shock accelerated CREs if about 1% of the shock ram pressure is converted into CREs\nand if the magnetic field is of order of 1-2 \u03bcG. This computed flux accounts\nfor the contribution from all the sources that are present in the synthetic\nimage, although it is almost entirely produced by the southern radio filamentary structure. The shock accelerated CREs have typically a flat distribution\nfunction, i.e., f (p\u0302) \u221d p\u0302\u2212q , q \u223c 4, implying a radio spectral index \u03b1 \u2248 \u22120.5.\nHowever, the total radio flux is produced by the contribution of various CREs\ndistributions that, as they leave the acceleration region and propagate away\nfrom it, steepen due to inverse Compton and synchrotron losses. Numerically,\nit is impossible to spatially resolve these populations. However, it is possible\nto compute their cumulative distribution function within the numerical cell.\nThis is automatically given by the steady state solution of eq. 10 where the\nsource term describes the shock accelerated CREs and the losses are due to\ninverse Compton and synchrotron emission. This approximation holds as long\nas the CREs cooling time is much shorter than the lifetime of shocks (see\nMiniati (2002) for further details). It is easy to show that for a shock accelerated distribution function f (p\u0302) \u221d p\u0302\u2212q the steady state solution of eq. 10 is\nof the form f (p\u0302) \u221d p\u0302\u2212(q+1) , (q + 1) = 5, which implies a radio spectral index\n\u03b1 = \u22121.\nThis value of \u03b1 is steeper than found in the observational results, although\nmarginally consistent within a 2 \u03c3 margin. Table 2 shows that in most of\nthe regions of the radio source a rather flat spectrum \u03b1 \u2248 \u22120.5 is favoured.\nThis value is in accord with what expected for a fresh distribution of CR\nelectrons accelerated at a strong shock in the test particle limit (Drury 1983).\nHowever, the spatial region sampled by the telescope beam is larger than\ndistance the CR electrons would propagate before being affected by IC and\nsynchrotron losses. In fact, the cooling time against IC losses of a relativistic\nelectron emitting synchrotron radiation at frequency \u03bdGHz in units GHz is\n\u03c4IC = 108 (B\u03bc /\u03bdGHz )1/2 yr, where B\u03bc is the magnetic field in \u03bcG. The distance\nto which such electrons can be carried by the background flow away from\nthe acceleration region is L= vf low \u03c4IC = 100 (vf low /103 km s\u22121 ) (B\u03bc / \u03bdGHz )1/2\nkpc. This distance is shorter than the telescope resolution length which at\nz \u2243 0.3 and for the assumed cosmological model, corresponds to 400 kpc (for\n1 arcmin). Therefore, in accord with the above picture, we would expect the\n28\n\n\fspectral index to be steeper than -0.5.\n\nWe can also compare the observed spectral index with the \"radio relic\" sources\nfound in the peripheral regions of clusters which usually have spectral indices\n\u03b1 . \u22121 and some times as steep as \u03b1 . \u22123 (Giovannini, Tordi, & Feretti\n1999, Slee et al. 2001). In case of relics a very steep radio spectrum is explained\nin a scenario in which injection of fresh relativistic electrons in these sources is\nbelieved to have ceased for a significant fraction of their lifetime. This picture\nis different from the conditions expected in the radio filament where ongoing\nin situ acceleration is likely to be taking place. Therefore one would expect a\nspectral index flatter than the relic sources. However, it seems possible that\nthe extended very steep spectrum source, detected only at 320 MHz to the NE of main filament, is in fact a region of relic emission, i.e., a remnant of past\nactivity. In any case, a resolution of the spectral index discrepancy between the\nobserved and simulated values requires additional radio observations possibly\nover a much wider frequency range than explored here, which would allow the\ndetailed spectral shape to be observed.\n\nThe above assumptions on the acceleration efficiency are consistent with a scenario in which about 20-30% of the shock ram pressure is converted into ionic\nCR pressure and an electrons to ions ratio at relativistic energies, Re/p \u223c\n3 \u2212 5 \u00d7 10\u22122 , in the range allowed for the Galactic CRs (Mueller & Tang\n1987, Mueller et al. 1995). With the total number of electrons fixed by this\nchoice of parameters for the acceleration efficiency, the measured flux would\nimply a magnetic field strength of order of 1\u03bcG. This is consistent with values\ninferred from Faraday rotation measures for clusters of galaxies (Clarke, Kronberg, & B\u00f6hringer 2001). However, the magnetic fields at accretion shocks\nhave not been probed yet and they could be weaker than assumed above. In\nthis respect, a detection of or an upper limit on the inverse Compton HXR\nflux would provide an important constraint on the magnetic field strength.\nAccording to our estimate, even with an average magnetic field as strong as\n1-2\u03bcG the HXR flux should amount to about 4 \u00d7 10\u221213 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 . Finally,\nthe thermal bremsstrahlung emission produced by the underlying collapsed\nstructure generates a flux of about 6 \u00d710\u221213 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 , corresponding to a\n\u223c 5 keV cluster. At the given redshift z \u223c 0.3 this would imply a total luminosity of \u223c 1044 erg s\u22121 . It is of interest to compare these values of thermal\nbremsstrahlung X-rays with those obtained from ROSAT data as reported in\n\u00a7 5 which are of the same order. We point out that these values are associated\nwith the whole emitting structure which, in the case of Fig. 13, consists of a\nmain collapsed object and two smaller structures. These objects are lined up\nalong a filamentary structure and are likely to merge later on as their evolution\nprogresses.\n29\n\n\f9\n\nDiscussion, Conclusions and Outlook for Future\n\nWe have presented here the first strong observational evidence for the existence of large-scale shocks originating in the accretion flows of intergalactic\ngas, as expected in theory of structure formation. The presence of such shocks\nis inferred from the diffuse radio emission extending over a physical scale of\nseveral Mpc, which intriguingly finds a structural counterpart in a filament of\noptical galaxies and in a distribution of hot, clustered, thermal X-ray emitting\ngas. The radio emission appears to be the synchrotron radiation from shock\naccelerated cosmic-ray electrons and is most likely associated with the intergalactic gas as a whole rather than with individual sources. This scenario is\nsupported by our analytical and numerical calculations which indicate that\nthe above model can easily account for the detected emission with conservative assumptions on the shock acceleration efficiency, and with a magnetic\nfield strength of order of a \u03bcG.\nThe implications of these observations are of great cosmological interest, because they probe two important components of cosmic environment: magnetic fields and cosmic-rays. They indicate that magnetic fields of significant\nstrength are present not only in the ICM but also in the diffuse inter-galactic\nmedium, i.e., in the gas that will be shocked as it accretes onto collapsing\nstructures - the precursors of virialized galaxy clusters. In fact, these magnetic fields are responsible not only for providing the scattering centers for\nthe diffusive shock acceleration mechanism to take place, but also for the synchrotron emission that we observed. No significant magnetic field would be\npresent in the post-shock region of the flow, if it were not already present upstream of the shock. Thus we have shown the first observational evidence for\nthe existence of magnetic fields in a super-cluster scale structure. Since it is all\nbut obvious how magnetic fields are amplified up to such large values in cosmic filaments, these findings pose further challenges to theoretical models. At\nthe same time, although particle acceleration at cosmic shocks is expected on\ntheoretical grounds (Bell 1978, Blandford & Ostriker 1978), theoreticians have\nbeen \"anxiously\" waiting for direct or indirect evidence that it really occurs\nand at what level it could be linked to the origin of radio relics (e.g., Miniati\net al. (2001b), Ensslin et al. (1998)). On the other hand, if diffusive shock\nacceleration takes place with some efficiency during the non-linear stage of\nlarge-scale structure formation, cosmic-ray ions accumulating in the forming\nstructure could become dynamically important with interesting cosmological\nconsequences (Miniati et al. 2001a).\nThe forming structure reported in this paper could also be a source of high\nenergy \u03b3-ray photons produced through CMBR inverse-Compton by relativistic electrons accelerated at large-scale structure formation shock-waves up to\n0.5 TeV (Loeb & Waxman 2000). Loeb & Waxman claim that these electrons\n30\n\n\fare responsible for the whole \u03b3-ray background flux, although according to\nMiniati (2002), only a small fraction (\u223c 10-20%) of such flux could be accounted for by inverse-Compton emission. In any case, strong \u03b3-emission is\nexpected from accretion flows around clusters [Miniati (2002), Keshet et al.\n(2002), but see also Totani & Kitayama (2000)].\nFor this reason, the proto-cluster filament ZwCl 2341.1+0000 is an ideal\nsource to check for \u03b3-ray emission. Its diffuse radio luminosity of \u223c 40 mJy\ncan be directly translated into an expected \u03b3-ray flux above energy E\u03b3 of\nF\u03b3 (> E\u03b3 ) = 10\u221210 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 (B/\u03bcG)\u22122 (E\u03b3 /100 MeV)\u22121 . For comparison - the sensitivities of the EGRET and upcoming GLAST surveys are a few\n10\u22128 and 10\u22129 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 respectively, demonstrating that future \u03b3-ray\nfacilities might become sensitive enough to address these issues.\nThus, the system ZwCl 2341.1+0000 provides an interesting cosmic laboratory where issues related to several high energy astrophysical phenomena can\nbe observationally explored. Further spectroscopic redshift mesurements and\ndeep imaging of a wider region, in association of sensitive X-ray and \u03b3-ray\nobservations of this structure will allow to study the energetic processes in the\ninter galactic medium in much greater detail. We hope that they will be able\nto reveal further the physical mechanisms that produce the relativistic electron population seen here in the radio-synchrotron emission and will probe the\ndistribution of dark matter relative to the luminous matter and the cosmicray particles. The detections of similar objects and signatures of shock waves\nwould help to test our understanding of the intergalactic weather (Quilis, Ibnez, & Saez 1998, Miniati et al. 2000, Burns 1998, Ensslin et al. 2001), which\nis driven by the power of cosmological structure formation flows.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank Hans B\u00f6hringer for kindly providing us with the ROSAT X-ray\nimages and for his many helpful comments.
