The quantity\n\u03c4 (x, y) is called the passage time through edge (x, y). For a path P : x0 \u2192 xP\n1 \u2192 * * * \u2192 xn of\nneighbouring vertices, we denote by \u03c4 (P) the passage time along P: \u03c4 (P) = ni=1 \u03c4 (xi\u22121 , xi ).\nThe family {\u03c4 (x, y)} defines a random distance over Zd as follows:\nD(x, y) = inf {\u03c4 (P) ; P goes from x to y. } .\nWe also set Bt := {x; D(0, x) \u2264 t}.\nThis model is called first passage percolation. We refer to Kesten's St-Flour Lecture\nNotes [5] for a nice introduction to the subject. In this work we focus on the case where\nthe common distribution of the passage times is the exponential distribution with parameter\none. This case has received a particular attention for at least two reasons:\n\u2022 The process t 7\u2192 Bt is then a Markov process. This is a consequence of the memorylessness property of the exponential random variable.\n\u2022 Consider the random process Bt only at random times at which a new vertex is added.\nNamely, set t0 = 0 and tk+1 = inf {t > tk ; Bt 6= Bt\u2212 } and look at the sequence\nBt0 , Bt1 , . . . . This discrete process is known as the Eden growth process [4], which\nwas introduced as a (very) simplified model for cells spread: to Btk one adds a new\nvertex x adjacent to Btk , with a probability which is proportional to the number of\nedges between x and Btk .\n1\n\n\fWe denote the canonical basis of Rd by (e1 , . . . , ed ). For a subset A \u2282 Rd , the random variable\nT (A) is the first time the cluster Bt hits A, that is,\nT (A) = min {t \u2265 0 ; Bt \u2229 A 6= \u2205} .\nWe will consider T (A) for the particular set Hn = {x1 = n}. Subadditivity theory was\nhistorically introduced by Hammersley and Welsh to show that the sequence T (n, 0, . . . , 0)/n\nconverges almost surely to a constant \u03bc = \u03bc(d), which is called the time constant. It can be\nseen as a consequence of the work of Cox and Durrett [1] that \u03bc is also the limit\n\u03bc = lim\na.s.\n\nT (Hn )\n.\nn\n\nKesten ([5], Th.8.2) was the first to prove that, for a large class of distributions for the \u03c4 's,\nthe constant \u03bc is of order log d/d. His result was later improved by Dhar for exponential\npassage times.\nTheorem (Dhar [3]). For exponential passage times,\nlim \u03bc(d)\n\nd\u2192\u221e\n\nd\n1\n= .\nlog d\n2\n\nSome numerical computations are included in [3], showing that the convergence is quite\nfast. Our aim in the present paper is to provide for a constructive proof of the fact that\n\u03bc = O(log d/d), by exhibiting a path going from the origin to H1 with small passage time.\nThis path, except its last edge, is included in H0 .\n\nA path P connecting 0 to {x1 = 1}\n\n2\n\nA tree-like construction of paths\nFix an integer l \u2265 2, and p1 , ..., pl a collection of l integers larger than 1. We want to\nassociate to these integers a path P(l, p1 , ..., pl ), having l + 1 edges and connecting the origin\nto H1 , along which passage times are as small as possible.\nThe first l edges of this path lie in hyperplane H0 , and the last one connects H0 to H1 .\nThe path P(l, p1 , ..., pl ) is defined as follows:\nStep 1 Among the 2(d \u2212 1) edges (0, 0 \u00b1 ei ) (with 2 \u2264 i \u2264 d), we consider the ones with the p1\nsmallest passage times. This gives p1 first edges ending at some vertices that we denote\nby x[1], . . . , x[p1 ].\nStep 2 From each point x1 [1], . . . , x1 [p1 ], consider the 2(d\u22121)\u22122p1 edges that are not collinear\nwith one of the edges that have been already used in Step 1. Among these p1 \u00d7 (2(d \u2212\n1) \u2212 2p1 ) distinct edges we choose the p2 smallest ones. They end at some distinct\nvertices that we denote by x2 [1], . . . , x2 [p2 ].\n...\n2\n\n\fStep l From each point xl\u22121 [1], . . . , xl\u22121 [pl\u22121 ], consider the 2(d \u2212 1) \u2212 2p1 \u2212 2p2 \u2212 * * * \u2212 2pl\u22121\nedges that are not collinear with one of the edges that have been already used in the\nprevious steps. Among these pl\u22121 \u00d7 (2(d \u2212 1) \u2212 2p1 \u2212 2p2 \u2212 * * * \u2212 2pl\u22121 ) distinct edges\nwe choose the pl smallest ones. They end at some distinct vertices that we denote by\nxl [1], . . . , xl [pl ].\nStep l + 1. Among the pl edges (xl [1], xl [1] + e0 ), . . . , (xl [pl ], xl [pl ] + e0 ) we choose the one with\nthe shortest passage time. We denote this path by xl \u2192 xl+1 .\nBacktracking from xl+1 to 0 defines our path: this is the only path\nP(l, p1 , ..., pl ) : 0 \u2192 x1 \u2192 x2 \u2192 x3 \u2192 * * * \u2192 xl\u22121 \u2192 xl \u2192 xl+1\nfor which, for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 l \u2212 1, the edge (xi , xi+1 ) is of the type (xi [r], xi+1 [s]) for some\nintegers r, s.\n\nThe passage time of P\n\nNow our main result states that, for large d, one can find among the paths P(l, p1 , ..., pl ) a\npath whose passage time is of optimal order:\nTheorem 1.\nlim sup\nd\u2192\u221e\n\ne\nd\ninf E[\u03c4 (P(l, p1 , ..., pl ))] \u2264 .\nlog d l,p1,...,pl\n4\n\nProof. Let us first introduce a notation. Fix two positive integers n \u2265 k \u2265 0 and take\ne1 , e2 , . . . , en a family of i.i.d. exponential random variables with parameter one. Pick uniformly one of the k smallest, we denote by f (n, k) its expectation. The mean passage time\nof P(l, p1 , ..., pl ) can be written\nE[\u03c4 (P(l, p1 , ..., pl ))] = f (2(d \u2212 1), p1) + f (p1 (2(d \u2212 1) \u2212 2p1 ), p2 ) + . . .\npl\u22122 (2(d \u2212 1) \u2212 2\n\n+f\n\nl\u22121\nX\ni=1\n\npi ), pl\n\n!\n\n+ f (pl , 1).

It then follows from\nthe law of large numbers that\nlim sup \u03bc\nd\u2192\u221e\n\nd\n\u2264 e/4 = 0.679...\nlog d\n\nComments on the result\n1. We obtain a short and constructive proof of the bound \u03bc \u2264 cst log d/d. We are however\nnot able to achieve Dhar's optimal bound with the constant 1/2. The latter was\nobtained with a recursive argument applied to Bt , but cannot provide for an effective\npath going to Hn .\n2. Kesten's original proof of the existence of a path whose time constant is less than some\nconstant (11 in his proof) times logd d was also non constructive. However, it indicates\nthat a path of length log d achieves this optimal order. This coincides with our choice\nof l in the proof of Theorem 1. If one restricts the scope to paths of length 3 (l = 2),\none already gets an interesting bound i.e.\n2\n\nlim sup d 3 inf E[\u03c4 (P(2, p1 , p2 ))] \u2264 C\nd\u2192\u221e\n\np1 ,p2\n\nwhich proves that, in dimension large enough, the horizontal\nspeed is bigger than the\n\u221a\ndiagonal speed, which has been proved to be of order d (see next section). More\nl\ngenerally, optimizing E[\u03c4 (P(l, p1 , ..., pl ))] for a fixed l leads to a bound \u03bc(d) \u2264 C/d l+1 .\n3. Our result could be extended to a large class of distributions over the passage times,\nprovided one has a good upper bound for f (n, k). This can be done if \u03c4 has a first\nmoment and a nice density near zero, not null at zero (such assumptions on \u03c4 were\nconsidered by Kesten).\n\n3\n\nDiscussion on the diagonal speed and the limiting\nshape\n\nRichardson [7] proved that Bt grows linearly and has a limit shape: there exists a nonrandom\nset B0 \u2282 Rd+1 such that, for all \u03b5 > 0,\n\u0013\n\u0012\nBt\nt\u2192\u221e\n\u2282 (1 + \u03b5)B0 \u2192 1.\nP (1 \u2212 \u03b5)B0 \u2282\nt\n4\n\n\f(Richardson didn't exactly deal with first passage percolation but with a class of discrete\ngrowth processes, including Eden's growth process.) The convergence also holds almost\nsurely, the most general result is due to Cox and Durrett [1].\nThe shape B0 appears to be a ball of a certain norm, which is not explicit. Eden and\nRichardson observed on simulations that B0 looks circular in dimension two (though, they\nonly performed the simulations up to a few hundreds vertices in Bt ). Kesten has shown that,\nsurprisingly enough, this is not the case for FPP with exponential passage times, at least\nwhen d > 650000. We conclude this paper by short arguments showing that B0 is not the\neuclidian ball when d \u2265 35. Let us denote by \u03bc\u22c6 the \"diagonal\" time constant1 :\nT (Jn )\n\u03bc\u22c6 = lim\n,\na.s. n\nn\n\u221a\n\u221a o\nwhere Jn = x1 + x2 + * * * + xd = n d . Kesten ([5] Th.8.3) observed that \u03bc\u22c6 \u2265 1/2e d =\n\u221a\n0.184.../ d which, compared to \u03bc = O(log d/d), gives that \u03bc < \u03bc\u22c6 if d is large enough,\nyielding that B0 is not the Euclidean ball. Carrying his argument a little further, we obtain\na slightly improved bound for \u03bc\u22c6 :\nTheorem 2.

The proof is elementary, it mainly consists in bounding the probability that a fixed\npath going from the origin to Jn has small passage times.\n(n)\nWe denote by Dk the set of self-avoiding paths of length k (in the sense that they do\nnot run twice through the same edge) starting from zero and hitting Jn for the first time at\ntime k. Because of self-avoidingness, passage times are independent along\n\u221a such a path.
