Strongly correlated non-intrinsic variability between 5 and\n8.5 GHz has been observed in one of the lensed images of the gravitational\nlens B1600+434. These non-intrinsic (i.e. 'external') variations are interpreted as radio-microlensing of relativistic \u03bcas-scale jet components\nin the source at a redshift of z=1.59 by massive compact objects in the\nhalo of the edge-on disk lens galaxy at z=0.41. We shortly summarize\nthese observations and discuss several new observational and theoretical\nprograms to investigate this new phenomenon in more detail.\n1.\n\nRadio-Microlensing: B1600+434\n\nMulti-frequency observations of the CLASS gravitational lens (GL) B1600+434\nwith the VLA and WSRT radio telescopes at 1.4, 5 and 8.5 GHz has unambiguously shown non-intrinsic variability in the lensed image that passes through\nthe dark-matter halo of the edge-on disk lens galaxy (Koopmans & de Bruyn\n2000; Koopmans et al. 2000a). Based on the amplitude\u2013timescale and frequency\ndependence of these non-intrinsic variations and the difference in variability between the two lensed images, separated by only 1.\u2032\u2032 4, the non-intrinsic variability\nis interpreted as radio-microlensing of relativistic \u03bcas-scale jet components in\nthe source by massive compact objects in the halo of the edge-on disk lens\ngalaxy. The alternatives, i.e. scintillation and extreme scattering, have considerable difficulties in explaining the time-scale and frequency dependence of the\nobservations (e.g. Koopmans & de Bruyn 2000; Koopmans et al. 2000a). An\nexample of these variations at 5 GHz is shown in Fig.1. The strong non-intrinsic\nevent between days 70\u2013100 is interpreted as a radio-microlensing caustic crossing. This type of event is extremely difficult to explain in terms of scattering\n(ISS) by the ionized interstellar medium (e.g. Koopmans et al. 2000b).\n2.\n\nRadio-Microlensing: Other Lens Systems & Future\n\nTo investigate radio-microlensing in B1600+434 and other lens systems in more\ndetail, we have started a number of new monitoring programs with the WSRT,\n1\n\n\f2\n\nL.V.E. Koopmans et al.\n\nFigure 1.\nPreliminary results (at 5 GHz) from the\n1999/2000 VLA monitoring\ncampaign of B1600+434. The\nupper light curve (image A)\npasses through the darkmatter halo of the edge-on\nspiral lens galaxy. Note several strong (up to 30%) events\nin the upper lightcurve and\nthe complete absence of these\nevents in the lower light curve\n(image B) after the measured\ntime delay of \u223c47 days.\n\nVLA and MERLIN radio telescopes. With the WSRT and VLA, we have been\nand are currently monitoring B1600+434 at 1.4, (1.7), 5.0, 8.5, 15 and (22) GHz.\n(Wavelengths between parentheses cover only part of the light curves.) This will\nenable us to further constrain the microlensing and ISS hypotheses based on\ntheir frequency dependence. In addition, we are currently monitoring 8 CLASS\nGL systems with the VLA at 8.5 GHz to measure additional time-delays for the\ndetermination of H0 . These lightcurves, however, also provide information on\nradio-microlensing. In addition, a MERLIN Key\u2013Project to monitor 12 CLASS\nGL systems (2/3 quads) at 5 GHz will conditionally start around Dec. 2000/Jan.\n2001, with the aim of finding new cases of radio-microlensing. Combined, we\nwill be able to search for this phenomenon in 14 aditional radio GL systems.\nBesides this ongoing observational effort, we are theoretically studying radiomicrolensing in B1600+434, using numerical microlensing simulations, to place\nconstraints on the fraction and mass-function of massive compact objects in the\nlens galaxy (Koopmans & Wambsganss, in prep).\nReferences\nKoopmans, L.V.E & de Bruyn, A.G., 2000, A&A, 358, 793\nKoopmans, L.V.E., de Bruyn, A.G., Wambsganss, J., Fassnacht, C.D., 2000a, to\nappear in Microlensing 2000: A New Era of Microlensing Astrophysics,\neds J.W.
