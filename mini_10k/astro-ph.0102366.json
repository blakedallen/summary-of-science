INTRODUCTION\n\nExisting models of gamma ray bursts (GRBs) face the problem of explaining the tremendous energy released by the central engine [1]. In the case of isotropic emission, the total\nenergy output should be as high as 1.4 \u00d7 1054 ergs, in case of GRB 990123 with redshift\nz = 1.6. Strongly beamed emission is needed for all known engine models, such as mergers\nand hypernovae, but such extreme beaming is difficult to arrange (see recent discussion by\nBlandford [2] and Rees [3]). In this paper we show that emission of pulsed electromagnetic\nradiation from cusps of superconducting cosmic strings naturally solves this problem and\nexplains the observational GRB data using only one engine parameter [4].\nCosmic strings are linear defects that could be formed at a symmetry breaking phase\ntransition in the early universe [5]. Strings predicted in most grand unified models respond\nto external electromagnetic fields as thin superconducting wires [6]. As they move through\ncosmic magnetic fields, such strings develop electric currents. Oscillating loops of superconducting string emit short bursts of highly beamed electromagnetic radiation through small\nstring segments, centered at peculiar points on a string, cusps, where velocity reaches speed\nof light. [7,8].\nThe idea that GRBs could be produced at cusps of superconducting strings was first\nsuggested by Babul, Paczynski and Spergel [9] (BPS) and further explored by Paczynski\n[10]. They assumed that the bursts originate at very high redshifts (z \u223c 100 \u2212 1000), with\nGRB photons produced either directly or in electromagnetic cascades developing due to\ninteraction with the microwave background. This model requires the existence of a strong\nprimordial magnetic field to generate the string currents.\nAs it stands, the BPS model does not agree with observations. The observed GRB\n< 3, and the observed duration of the bursts (10\u22122 s < \u03c4 <\nredshifts are in the range z \u223c\n\u223c \u223c\n\n103 s) is significantly longer than that predicted by the model. On the theoretical side, our\nunderstanding of cosmic string evolution and of the GRB generation in relativistic jets have\n3\n\n\fconsiderably evolved since the BPS papers were written. Our goal in this paper is to revive\nthe BPS idea taking stock of these recent advances.\nAs in the BPS model we shall use the cusp of a superconducting string as the central\nengine in GRB. It provides the tremendous engine energy naturally beamed. Our main\nobservation is that putting superconducting cusps in a different enviroment, the magnetized\nplasma at a relatively small redshift z, results in a different mechanism of gamma radiation,\nwhich leads to a good agreement with GRB observational data.\nGRB radiation in our model arises as follows. Low-frequency electromagnetic radiation\nfrom a cusp loses its energy by accelerating particles of the plasma to very large Lorentz\nfactors. Like the initial electromagnetic pulse, the particles are beamed and give rise to\na hydrodynamical flow in the surrounding gas, terminated by a shock, as in the standard\nfireball theory of GRB [11] (for a review see [1]).\nThe string symmetry breaking scale \u03b7 will be the only string parameter used in our\ncalculations. With reasonable assumptions about the magnitude of cosmic magnetic fields\nand the fraction of volume in the Universe that they occupy, this parameter is sufficient to\naccount for all main GRB observational quantities: the duration \u03c4GRB , the rate of events\n\u1e44GRB , and the fluence S.\nWe begin in the next Section with a brief review of cosmic string properties and evolution, with an emphasis on the physics of cusps and on the generation and dissipation of\nelectric current in superconducting strings. (The discussion of the latter topic in the existing\nliterature is often oversimplified and sometimes incorrect, so we review it in more detail than\nwe otherwise would.) The GRB characteristics in our model are calculated in Section III,\nand the hydrodynamical aspects of the model are discussed in Section IV. In Section V we\ndiscuss the diffuse X-ray and \u03b3-ray backgrounds predicted by the model, as well as other\nobservational predictions, which include GRB repeaters, bursts of gravitational radiation,\nand ultrahigh-energy particles.\n\n4\n\n\fII. STRING OVERVIEW\n\nA. String properties and evolution\n\nHere we briefly review some aspects of cosmic string properties and evolution, which are\nrelevant for the discussion below (for a detailed review and references see [5]).\nStrings are characterized by the energy scale of symmetry breaking \u03b7, which is given by\nthe expectation value of the corresponding Higgs field, h\u03c6i = \u03b7. The mass per unit length\nof string is given by\n\u03bc \u223c \u03b72.\n\n(1)\n\nAn important dimensionless parameter characterizing the gravitational interactions of strings\nis\nG\u03bc \u223c (\u03b7/mP )2 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere G is Newton's constant and mP is the Planck mass. In many models this is the only\nrelevant string parameter.\nNumerical simulations of cosmic string evolution indicate that strings evolve in a selfsimilar manner [12\u201314]. A horizon-size volume at any time t contains a few long strings\nstretching across the volume and a large number of small closed loops. The typical distance\nbetween long strings and their characteristic curvature radius are both \u223c t, but, in addition,\nthe strings have small-scale wiggles of wavelength down to\nl \u223c \u03b1t,\n\n(3)\n\nwith \u03b1 \u226a 1. The typical length of loops being chopped off the long strings is comparable to\nthe scale of the smallest wiggles (3).\nThe loops oscillate periodically and lose their energy, mostly by gravitational radiation.\nFor a loop of invariant length l [15], the oscillation period is Tl = l/2 and the lifetime is\n\u03c4l \u223c l/kg G\u03bc, where kg \u223c 50 is a numerical coefficient.\n5\n\n\fThe exact value of the parameter \u03b1 in (3) is not known. Numerical simulations give\n< 10\u22123 , while the analysis of gravitational radiation backreaction\nonly an upper bound, \u03b1 \u223c\n> kg G\u03bc. We shall assume, following [12], that \u03b1 is determined by the\nindicates that \u03b1 \u223c\ngravitational backreaction, so that\n\u03b1 \u223c kg G\u03bc.\n\n(4)\n\nNote that in this case the loops decay within about one Hubble time of their formation.\nThen, most of the loops at time t have length l \u223c \u03b1t, and their number density is given by\nnl (t) \u223c \u03b1\u22121 t\u22123 .\n\n(5)\n\nAnalysis of string equations of motion reveals that oscillating loops tend to form cusps,\nwhere for a brief period of time the string reaches the speed very close to the speed of light.\nNear a cusp, the string gets contracted by a large factor, its rest energy being turned into\nkinetic energy. For a string segment of invariant length \u03b4l \u226a l, the maximum contraction\nfactor is \u223c l/\u03b4l, resulting in a Lorentz factor\n\u03b3 \u223c l/\u03b4l.\n\n(6)\n\nTo avoid confusion, we note that cusps were originally defined [16] as points of infinite\ncontraction, where the string momentarily reaches the speed of light. Strictly speaking, such\ncusps can be formed only on idealized infinitely thin strings. For realistic strings, the cusp\ndevelopment is truncated either by the annihilation of overlapping string segments at the\ntip of the cusp [17\u201319] or for superconducting strings, by the back reaction of charge carriers\nor of the electromagnetic radiation. However, unless the string current is very large, so that\nthe energy of the charge carriers is comparable to that of the string itself, the truncation\noccurs at a very large Lorentz factor and the string exhibits cusp-like behavior. Below we\nshall use the word \"cusps\" to refer to such ultra-relativistic string segments.\n\n6\n\n\fCusps typically form a few times during an oscillation period, but it is possible to construct (somewhat contrived) loop configurations exhibiting no cusps. Apart from various\nbackreaction effects, the motion of loops is strictly periodic, and thus cusps reappear at\nnearly the same locations on the string in each oscillation period.\nAnother peculiar feature that one can expect to find on string loops is a kink [20]. It\nis characterized by a sharp bent, where the string direction changes discontinuously. Two\noppositely moving kinks are produced on a loop at the moment when the loop is disconnected\nfrom a long string. The kinks then run around the loop at the speed of light.\n\nB. String superconductivity\n\nAs first shown by Witten [6], strings predicted in a wide class of elementary particle\nmodels behave as superconducting wires. If some fermions acquire their mass as a result of\nthe same symmetry breaking that is responsible for the string formation, then these fermions\nare massive outside the string but are massless inside. If in addition some of these fermions\nare electrically charged, then the strings have massless charge carriers which travel along\nthe string at the speed of light. The fermion mass outside the string is m = \u03bb\u03b7, where \u03bb\nis the Yukawa coupling of the fermion to the Higgs field of the string. Yukawa couplings in\nparticle physics models are often very small, so it is not unusual to have m \u226a \u03b7. String\nsuperconductivity can also be bosonic, with charge carriers being either spin-zero bosons or\nspin-one gauge particles. Here, we shall consider only fermionic superconductivity.\nAn electric field E applied along a superconducting string generates an electric current.\nThe Fermi momentum of the charge carriers grows with time as \u1e57F = eE, where e is the\nelementary charge, and the number of fermions per unit length, n = pF /2\u03c0, also grows,\n\u1e45 \u223c eE. The resulting current, J \u223c en, grows at the rate\ndJ/dt \u223c e2 E.\n7\n\n(7)\n\n\fA superconducting loop oscillating in a magnetic field B acts as an ac generator and\ndevelops an ac current of amplitude\nJ0 \u223c e2 Bl.\n\n(8)\n\nThis loop current is not homogeneous; it changes direction along the string and is more\naccurately described as current-charge oscillations. Some portions of the loop develop charge\ndensities \u223c J0 . For typical values used in the calculations below, B = 1 * 10\u22127 G and\nl = \u03b1t0 \u223c 30 pc, with \u03b1 = 1 * 10\u22128 and t0 \u223c 1010 yrs the present age of the universe, one\nobtains J0 \u223c 2 * 105 GeV.\nThe local value of the string current can be greatly enhanced in the vicinity of cusps.\nThe portion of the string that attains a Lorentz factor \u03b3 is contracted by a factor \u223c 1/\u03b3.\nThe charge carrier density, and thus the current, are enhanced by the same factor, so the\ncurrent becomes (in the local rest frame of the string)\nJ\u03b3 \u223c \u03b3J0 .\n\n(9)\n\nThe growth of electric current at the cusp is terminated at a critical value Jmax when the\nenergy of charge carriers becomes comparable to that of the string itself, (J/e)2 \u223c \u03bc. This\ngives Jmax and \u03b3max as [21]\nJmax \u223c e\u03b7,\n\n\u03b3max \u223c (e\u03b7/J0 ).\n\n(10)\n\nAlternatively, the cusp development can be terminated by small-scale wiggles on the string\n[22]. If the wiggles contribute a fraction \u01eb \u226a 1 to the total energy of the string, then the\nmaximum Lorentz factor is less than (10), and is given by\n\u03b3max \u223c \u01eb\u22121/2 .\nThe actual value of \u03b3max is not important for most of the following discussion.\n\n8\n\n(11)\n\n\fIn realistic models, the strings have several fermion species as charge carriers. It can\nbe shown that fermions of a given species can move only in a certain direction along the\nstring. Thus, the charge carrier species can be divided into left-movers and right-movers. If,\nfor example, the applied electric field is directed to the right, it produces positively charged\nright-movers and negatively charged left-movers (and vice versa for the opposite direction\nof E). The left-movers and right-movers usually differ by flavour, lepton number, or some\nother conserved or weakly violated quantum number.\nIn the absence of an external electromagnetic field, the current in an oscillating loop\ndecays due to various dissipation mechanisms. These include: scattering of left- and rightmovers [23,24], electromagnetic back-reaction [25,26], and plasma effects [27].\nCharge carrier loss due to scattering of left- and right-movers is highly model-dependent.\nIf the scattering is mediated by superheavy gauge bosons of mass MX \u223c 1015 GeV, then the\ncharacteristic scattering time is [23]\n\u03c4sc \u223c 3 * 10\n\n4\n\n\u0012\n\nJ\n5\n10 GeV\n\n\u0013\u22125\n\nyrs.\n\n(12)\n\nFor J < 104 GeV this time is greater than the age of the universe, but \u03c4sc decreases rapidly\nwith the growth of the current and becomes comparable to the typical oscillation period\nof loops (Tl \u223c 100 yrs for l \u223c 30 pc) for J \u223c 3 * 105 GeV. In near-cusp regions, where\nJ \u226b 105 GeV, charge carrier scattering becomes very efficient.\nWe note, however, that this current loss mechanism has an important limitation. The\ndensities of left- and right-moving charge carriers are typically not equal, and even if scattering were 100% efficient, it would stop after eliminating the minority charge carriers, leaving\nthe string with a chiral current (that is, with a current consisting of only left- or rightmovers). This is what we expect to happen in the vicinity of cusps.\nThe electromagnetic back-reaction typically damps the loop current on a timescale \u03c4em \u223c\nl/e2 \u223c 100l, which is much shorter than the loop's lifetime. It tends to damp the spatial\ncomponent of the current, with the total charge of the loop remaining the same, so in\n9\n\n\fthe absence of other effects the end result would be left- and right-moving currents of the\nsame magnitude and the same charge.1 Combined with scattering of charge carriers, this\nmechanism can dissipate loop charges and currents, even in the chiral case. Moreover, the\nstring charge is almost completely screened by a vacuum condensate [28], so the string\nis effectively neutral even if the scattering rate is low and there is some residual charge.\nIt should be noted that the physics of electromagnetic back-reaction can be significantly\nmodified by plasma effects, which are presently not well understood. Thompson [27] has\nargued that current damping becomes more efficient in the presence of plasma.\nAnother mechanism that can dissipate a large chiral current operates when a loop oscillates in an external magnetic field. The emf induced in the loop oscillates with the same\nperiod. Suppose for definiteness that the loop initially has a chiral current Ji consisting\nof positively charged right-movers. When the emf is directed oppositely to this current,\nthe magnitude of the right-moving current is reduced by \u223c J0 and a positively charged leftmoving current of magnitude \u223c J0 is generated, with J0 from Eq. (8). Left- and right-movers\ncan now scatter off the string, and if \u03c4sc < Tl , the chiral component of the current will be\nreduced by \u223c J0 . The initial current will then be dissipated in \u223c Ji /J0 oscillations.\nThe effect of all these dissipation mechanisms is to damp the loop's charge and current\non a timescale\n\u03c4d \u223c (1 \u2212 100)l.\n\n(13)\n\nThis means in particular that the loop quickly forgets any initial charge or current that it\ninherits when it is chopped off the long string network. The magnitude of the current in a\n\n1 Spergel\n\net. al. [26] argued that the dc component of the current cannot be changed by the e-m\n\nback-reaction. However, their Eq. (11) which they quote in support of this statement is in fact an\nexpression of charge conservation.\n\n10\n\n\floop is determined mainly by the local magnitude of the cosmic magnetic field, as in Eq.\n(8).\nWe note finally that Eq. (8) for the current is modified when the loop has an appreciable\ncenter-of-mass velocity v [8]. In this case, the amplitude of current-charge oscillations grows\nlinearly with time, until the growth is hampered by the damping processes. The resulting\namplitude is\nJ0 \u223c e2 Bv\u03c4d .\n\n(14)\n\nLoops can have high center-of-mass velocities, v \u223c 1, but in view of the uncertainty in the\ndamping time (13) we shall use the estimate (8) for the current.\n\nIII. GRB ENGINE\n\nThere are three types of sites in the universe where magneic fields can induce large electric\ncurrents in the strings. They are compact structures (galaxies and clusters of galaxies),\nvoids, and walls (filaments and sheets) of the large-scale structures. The total rate of GRBs\nis dominated by the walls, and further on we shall concentrate on these structures only.\nMagnetic fields in our scenario are assumed to be generated in young galaxies during the\nbright phase of their evolution [29] and then dispersed by galactic winds in the intergalactic\nspace. Then at present the fields are concentrated in the filaments and sheets of the largescale structure [30,31].\nAssuming that magnetic fields were generated at some z \u223c zB (galaxy formation epoch)\nand then remained frozen in the extragalactic plasma, we obtain\nB(z) = B0 (1 + z)2 ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere the characteristic field strength at the present time B0 can be estimated from the\nequipartition condition as B0 \u223c 10\u22127 G [30].\n11\n\n\fWith sheets of characteristic size L \u223c (20 \u2212 50)h\u22121 Mpc and thickness D \u223c 5h\u22121 Mpc,\nwe can estimate the fraction of the space occupied by the walls with magnetized plasma as\nfB \u223c D/L \u223c 0.1. For numerical estimates below we shall use zB \u223c 4.\nWe shall now estimate the physical quantities characterizing GRBs powered by cusps of\nsuperconducting strings. In what follows we assume that the universe is spatially flat, is\ndominated by non-relativistic matter, and has age t0 = 0.87 * 1010 yr, which corresponds to\ndimensionless Hubble constant h = 0.75.\n\nA. GRB rate and fluence\n\nDue to the large current, the cusp produces a powerful pulse of electromagnetic radiation.\ntot\nThe total energy of the pulse is given by [7,8] Eem\n\u223c 2kem J0 Jmax l, where l \u223c \u03b1t is the length\n\nof the loop, and the coefficient kem \u223c 10 is taken from numerical calculations [7]. This\nradiation is emitted within a very narrow cone of openening angle \u03b8min \u223c 1/\u03b3max . The\nangular distribution of radiated energy at larger angles is given by [7]\ndEem /d\u03a9 \u223c kem J02 l/\u03b83 .\n\n(16)\n\nFor a GRB originating at redshift z and seen at angle \u03b8 with respect to the string velocity\nat the cusp, we have from Eqs.(8)-(15)\ndEem /d\u03a9 \u223c kem e4 \u03b13 t30 B02 (1 + z)\u22121/2 \u03b8\u22123 ,\n\n(17)\n\nThe Lorentz factor of the relevant string segment near the cusp is \u03b3 \u223c 1/\u03b8. The duration of\nthe cusp event as seen by a distant observer is [9]\n\u03c4c \u223c (1 + z)(\u03b1t/2)\u03b3 \u22123 \u223c (\u03b1t0 /2)(1 + z)\u22121/2 \u03b83 .\n\n(18)\n\nOne can expect that the observed duration of GRB is \u03c4GRB \u223c \u03c4c . This expectation will be\njustified by the hydrodynamical analysis in Section IV.\n12\n\n\fThe fluence, defined as the total energy per unit area of the detector, is [10]\nS \u223c (1 + z)(dEem /d\u03a9)d\u22122\nL (z),\n\n(19)\n\nwhere dL (z) = 3t0 (1 + z)1/2 [(1 + z)1/2 \u2212 1] is the luminosity distance.\nThe rate of GRBs originating at cusps in the redshift interval dz and seen at an angle \u03b8\nin the interval d\u03b8 is given by\n1\nd\u1e44GRB \u223c fB * \u03b8d\u03b8(1 + z)\u22121 \u03bd(z)dV (z).\n2\n\n(20)\n\nHere, \u03bd(t) \u223c nl (t)/Tl \u223c 2\u03b1\u22122 t\u22124 is the number of cusp events per unit spacetime volume,\nTl \u223c \u03b1t/2 is the oscillation period of a loop, dV = 54\u03c0t30 [(1 + z)1/2 \u2212 1]2 (1 + z)\u221211/2 dz is the\nproper volume between redshifts z and z + dz, and we have used the relation dt0 = (1 + z)dt.\nSince different cusp events originate at different redshifts and are seen at different angles,\nour model automatically gives a distribution of durations and fluences of GRBs. The angle\n\u03b8 is related to the Lorentz factor of the relevant portion of the string as \u03b8 \u223c 1/\u03b3, and from\nEqs.(17),(19) we have\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u22121 1/3 \u22122/3\n\u03b3(z; S) \u223c \u03b30 \u03b1\u22128\nS\u22128 B\u22127 [( 1 + z \u2212 1)2 1 + z]1/3 .\n\n(21)\n\nHere, \u03b30 \u2248 190, \u03b1\u22128 = \u03b1/10\u22128, and the fluence S and the magnetic field B0 are expressed\nas S = S\u22128 * 10\u22128 erg/cm2 and B0 = B\u22127 * 10\u22127 G.\nVery large values of \u03b3 \u223c \u03b3max , which correspond (for a given redshift) to largest fluences,\nmay not be seen at all because the radiation is emitted into a too narrow solid angle and the\nobserved rates of these events are too small. The minimum value \u03b3(z; Smin ) is determined by\n> 1 with Smin \u223c 3 * 10\u22128 erg/cm2 ,\nthe smallest fluence that is observed, e.g. for GRBs at z \u223c\n\u03b3min \u2248 170. Another lower limit on \u03b3, which dominates at small z, follows from the condition\n> 100 (see Section IV).\nof compactness [1] and is given by \u03b3 \u223c\nThe total rate of GRBs with fluence larger than S is obtained by integrating Eq.(20)\n\u22121\nover \u03b8 from \u03b3max\n(z) to \u03b3 \u22121 (z; S) and over z from 0 to min[zm ; zB ], with zm from \u03b3max (zm ) =\n\n13\n\n\f2\n\u03b3(zm ; S). For relatively small fluences, S\u22128 < Sc = 0.03(\u03b3max (0)\u03b1\u22128 /\u03b30)3 B\u22127\n, zB < zm and\n\nwe obtain\n\u1e44GRB (> S) \u223c\n\nfB\n2\u03b12 t40\n\nZ\n\nzB\n\n0\n\ndV (z)(1 + z)5 \u03b3 \u22122 (z; S)\n\n\u22122/3\n\n4/3\n\n\u223c 3 * 102 S\u22128 B\u22127 yr \u22121.\n\n(22)\n\nRemarkably, this rate in our model does not depend on any string parameters and is determined (for a given value of S) almost entirely by the magnetic field B0 . It agrees with the\nobserved rate for B\u22127 \u223c 1 (formally, the observed rate \u1e44 \u223c 300yr\u22121 at S > 1 * 10\u22127 erg/cm2\ngives B\u22127 = 3.2). The predicted slope \u1e44GRB (> S) \u221d S \u22122/3 is also in a reasonable agreement\nwith the observed one \u1e44obs (> S) \u221d S \u22120.55 at relatively small fluences [32].\nFor large fluences S\u22128 > Sc , integration of Eq.(20) gives \u1e44GRB (> S) \u221d S \u22123/2 . Observationally, the transition to this regime occurs at S\u22128 \u223c 102 \u2212 103 . This can be accounted for\nif the cusp development is terminated by small-scale wiggles with fractional energy in the\n4/3\n\n2\nwiggles \u01eb \u223c 10\u22127\u03b1\u22128\nB\u22127 . Alternatively, if \u03b3max is determined by the back-reaction of the\n\ncharge carriers, Eq.(10), then the regime (22) holds for larger S\u22128 , and observed steepening\nof the distribution at large S can be due to the reduced efficiency of BATSE to detection\nof bursts with large \u03b3. Indeed, large \u03b3 results in a large Lorentz factor \u03b3CD of the emitting\n> 103 photons start to escape from the BATSE range.\nregion (see Section IV), and at \u03b3CD \u223c\nB. GRB duration\n\nThe duration of GRBs originating at redshift z and having fluence S is readily calculated\nfrom Eqs.(18) and (21) as\n\u03c4GRB\n\n4\n2\n\u221a\n\u03b1\u22128\nB\u22127\n(1 + z)\u22121 ( 1 + z \u2212 1)\u22122 s\n\u2248 200\nS\u22128\n\n(23)\n\nFrom Eqs.(20) and (18) we find the rate of GRBs with durations in the interval d\u03c4 and\nredshifts in the interval dz,\n14\n\n\fd\u1e44 \u223c 10\n\n2\n\n\u03b1\u22122 t\u22121\n0\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c4\n\u03b1t0\n\n\u00132/3\n\n\u221a\nd\u03c4\n( 1 + z \u2212 1)2 (1 + z)\u22121/6 dz .\n\u03c4\n\n(24)\n\nThe distribution of GRB durations is found by integrating this over z. The integration is\nrestricted by z < zB and S > Smin \u223c 3 * 10\u22128 erg/cm2 . The latter condition can be expressed\nas z < z\u0303(\u03c4 ), where z\u0303(\u03c4 ) is the solution of Eq. (23) for z with S \u223c Smin .\nThe distribution changes its form at the characteristic value \u03c4\u2217 defined by z\u0303(\u03c4\u2217 ) = zB .\nWith zB = 4, Eq. (23) gives\n4\n2\n\u03c4\u2217 \u223c 8.7\u03b1\u22128\nB\u22127\ns.\n\nFor \u03c4 < \u03c4\u2217 we have d\u1e44 \u221d \u03c4 2/3 d\u03c4 /\u03c4 , and for \u03c4 \u226b \u03c4\u2217 ,\n\n(25)\nd\u1e44 \u221d \u03c4 \u22125/6 d\u03c4 /\u03c4 . We thus see that\n\nthe distribution is peaked at \u03c4 \u223c \u03c4\u2217 .\nThe largest value of \u03c4 in our model is obtained from Eq.(18) with \u03b8 \u223c \u03b8max \u223c 10\u22122 ,\nmax\n\u03c4GRB\n\u223c 103 \u03b1\u22128 s. There is no sharp lower cutoff, but very small values of \u03c4 will not be\n\nobserved due to the low rate of events. With the rate \u223c 102 yr\u22121 near the peak of the\ndistribution, the rate of events with \u03c4 \u223c 10\u22124 \u03c4\u2217 is about 0.1 yr\u22121 .\nA lower bound on \u03c4 is also set by the detector resolution (\u223c 10\u22122 s for BATSE). Hence,\nwe have \u03c4min \u223c max{10\u22124 \u03c4\u2217 , 10\u22122 s}.\nThe observed distribution of GRB durations extends from \u223c 10\u22122 s to \u223c 103 s. The\ndistribution is bimodal, with peaks at 0.5 s and 15 s [33], and there are some observational\nindications that short and long GRBs may have different origin. Our model is probably\nbetter suited to describe the short GRB population (see Section V). With \u03c4\u2217 \u223c 0.5 s and\nB\u22127 \u223c 3, Eq.(25) gives \u03b1\u22128 \u223c 0.3. This corresponds to the string symmetry breaking scale\nmin\nmax\n\u03b7 \u223c 1 * 1014 GeV. The range of GRB durations is then given by \u03c4GRB\n\u223c 10\u22122 s, \u03c4GRB\n\u223c 103 s.\n\nIt should be noted that the validity of our simple one-parameter model does not extend\nbeyond rough order-of-magnitude estimates (see Section VI). In particular, it is not expected\nto give the correct duration distribution \u1e44 (\u03c4 ), and identifying the peaks of the theoretical\nand observed distributions may therefore exceed the accuracy of the model. A more con15\n\n\fservative approach is to require that the characteristic duration \u03c4\u2217 lies within the observed\n< \u03b1\u22128 < 3.\nrange of GRB durations. This gives 0.2 \u223c\n\u223c\nIV. ACCELERATION AND HYDRODYNAMICS\n\nA beam of low-frequency e-m radiation propagating in plasma produces a beam of accelerated particles.\nThe characteristic frequency of e-m radiation in a pulse produced by a cusp segment with\nLorentz factor \u03b3 is\n\u03c9em \u223c\n\n4\u03c0 3\n\u22121 \u22121\n\u03b3 (1 + z)3/2 = 4.6(\u03b3/103 )3 (1 + z)3/2 \u03b1\u22128\ns .\n\u03b1t0\n\n(26)\n\nThe plasma frequency in the intergalactic gas of density n = n\u22125 10\u22125 cm\u22123 ,\n1/2\n\n\u03c9pl = 1.8 * 102 n\u22125 s\u22121 ,\n\n(27)\n\n1/3\n\u22121/2\n< 3.4 * 103 n1/6\nis higher than \u03c9em when \u03b3 \u223c\n. Therefore, the low-frequency\n\u22125 \u03b1\u22128 (1 + z)\n\nradiation from the cusp cannot propagate in plasma. In fact, the energy density of e-m\nbeam is much larger than that of the plasma, and the beam would push the plasma away\neven in the case \u03c9em > \u03c9pl . This process occurs due to the acceleration of plasma particles.\nLet us consider the propagation of a charged test particle in a strong, low-frequency\ne-m wave. For a time interval much shorter than the period of the wave, t \u226a 1/\u03c9em , the\ne-m field of the wave can be approximated by static, orthogonal electric and magnetic fields\nof equal magnitude. Solution of the equations of motion (see e.g. [34]) shows that both\npositive and negative charges are accelerated mainly in the direction of wave propagation,\nn = (E \u00d7 B)/EB, with their Lorentz factor increasing with time as\n\u03b3b (t) =\n\n!2/3\n\n3 eB\n\u221a\nt\n2 m\n\n,\n\n(28)\n\nwhere m is the particle's mass. The synchrotron energy loss of an accelerated particle is\nsmall, because when it moves in the direction of wave propagation, n, the electric force, eE,\n16\n\n\fand the magnetic force ev \u00d7 B almost exactly compensate each other: e(E + vn \u00d7 B) \u2248 0.\nThis regime of acceleration is practically the same as in the Gunn-Ostriker mechanism [35].\nFor an e-m wave in vacuum, a test particle would be accelerated at t \u223c 1/\u03c9em up to\na very large Lorentz factor. But the maximum Lorentz factor of the beam is saturated at\nthe value \u03b3b , when the energy of the beam reaches the energy of the original e-m pulse:\nNb m\u03b3b \u223c Eem . This results in the Lorentz factor of the beam\n2\n4\n6\n\u03b3b \u223c 4 * 102 B\u22127\nn\u22121\n\u22125 (1 + z) (\u03b3/100) .\n\n(29)\n\nLet us now turn to the hydrodynamical phenomena in which the gamma radiation of\nthe burst is actually generated. The beam of accelerated particles pushes the gas with the\nfrozen magnetic field ahead of it, producing an external shock in surrounding plasma and\na reverse shock in the beam material, as in the case of \"ordinary\" fireball (for a review see\n[1]). The difference is that the beam propagates with a very large Lorentz factor \u03b3b \u226b \u03b3,\nwhere \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor of the cusp (the precise value of \u03b3b is not important for our\ndiscussion). Another difference is that the beam propagates in a very low-density gas. The\nbeam can be regarded as a narrow shell of relativistic particles of width \u2206 \u223c l/2\u03b3 3 in the\nobserver's frame.\nThe gamma radiation of the burst is produced as synchrotron radiation of electrons\naccelerated by external and reverse shocks. Naively, the duration of synchrotron radiation,\ni.e. \u03c4GRB , is determined by the thickness of the shell as \u03c4GRB \u223c \u2206. This is confirmed by a\nmore detailed analysis, as follows. The reverse shock in our case is ultrarelativistic [36,1].\nThe neccessary condition for that, \u03c1b /\u03c1 < \u03b3b2 , is satisfied with a wide margin (here \u03c1b is\nthe baryon density in the beam and \u03c1 is the density of unperturbed gas). In this case, the\nshock dynamics and the GRB duration are determined by two hydrodynamical parameters\n[1]. They are the thickness of the shell \u2206 and the Sedov length, defined as the distance\ntravelled by the shell when the mass of the snow-ploughed gas becomes comparable to the\ninitial energy of the beam. The latter is given by lSed \u223c (Eiso/\u03c1)1/3 .\n17\n\n\fThe reverse shock enters the shell and, as it propagates there, it strongly decelerates the\nshell. The synchrotron radiation occurs mainly in the shocked regions of the shell and of the\nexternal plasma. The surface separating these two regions, the contact discontinuity (CD)\nsurface, propagates with the same velocity as the shocked plasma, where the GRB radiation\nis produced.\nThe synchrotron radiation ceases when the reverse shock reaches the inner boundary of\n3/4\n\nthe shell. This occurs at a distance R\u2206 \u223c lSed \u22061/4 when the Lorentz factor of the CD surface\nis\n1/4 \u22121/8\n\n\u03b3CD \u223c (lSed/\u2206)3/8 \u223c 0.1B\u22127 n\u22125 (1 + z)1/2 \u03b3 3/2 .\n\n(30)\n\nNote that these values do not depend on the Lorentz factor of the beam \u03b3b and are determined\nby the cusp Lorentz factor \u03b3. The size of the synchrotron emitting region is of the order\nR\u2206 , and the Lorentz factor of this region is equal to \u03b3CD . The compactness condition [1]\n> 102 , and Eq. (30) yields \u03b3 > 102 which we used earlier in Section III. The\nrequires \u03b3CD \u223c\n\u223c\nduration of GRB is given by\n2\n\u03c4GRB \u223c R\u2206 /2\u03b3CD\n\u223c l/2\u03b3 3 ,\n\n(31)\n\ni.e. it is equal to the duration of the cusp event given by Eq.(18). The energy that goes into\nsynchrotron radiation is comparable to the energy of the electromagnetic pulse.\n\nV. PREDICTIONS AND PROBLEMS\n\nIn this section we shall consider a number of predictions of our model. Some of these\npredictions pose potential problems.\n(i) Short-time structure of GRBs.\nMost of GRBs exhibit a complex short-time structure. These variations must be a property of inner engine [1,37]. In the cusp model they can be naturally produced by wiggles.\n18\n\n\fWiggles are amplified in near-cusp regions and, acting like minicusps, produce a sequence of\nsuccessive fireballs. A quantitative analysis of this effect would require a detailed study of\nthe gravitational back-reaction, which controls the amplitude of the wiggles.\n(ii) Repeaters.\nCusps reappear on a loop with a period of loop oscillation, producing nearly identical\nGRBs. In our model, where all loops have the same length l = \u03b1t at a given cosmological\nepoch t, the recurrence time, Tl \u223c (1 + z)\u03b1t/2 \u223c 50\u03b1\u22128 (1 + z)\u22121/2 yr, is too long to be\nobserved by BATSE and other detectors. In a more realistic models, some fraction of loops\nwould have lengths smaller than \u03b1t and thus shorter recurrence periods. This fraction is\nmodel-dependent. Moreover, GRBs from repeaters with l < \u03b1t must be weak and have short\ndurations.\nThe GRB fluence from a loop of length l produced by a string segment with Lorentz\nfactor \u03b3 can be readily calculated as\n(1 + z)4\nB2\n1\nS \u223c kem e4 l3 \u03b3 3 20\n9\nt0 [(1 + z)1/2 \u2212 1]2\n\n(32)\n\nAfter a change of variables from \u03b3 and l to \u03c4GRB and the reccurence period Trec = l(1 + z)/2,\nwe obtain\n\u03c4GRB \u223c kem e4\n\n4\nB02\n(1 + z)\nTrec\n.\nt20 [(1 + z)1/2 \u2212 1]2 S\n\n(33)\n\n< 10\u22127\nA search for repeaters with Trec \u2264 5 yr requires, according Eq.(33), low fluences S \u223c\n< 40 ms. The BATSE efficiency is low for such events\nerg/cm2 and short durations \u03c4GRB \u223c\n[38] and the repeating burst could easily have been lost. The total number of GRBs shorter\nthan 40 ms in BATSE 3B catalogue is less than 5 [39].\n(iii) Host galaxies\nThe discovery of GRB aferglows revealed an association of long-duration GRBs with\ngalaxies (see [40] for a review). 19 GRBs with long durations are found to be undoubtedly\n19\n\n\fhosted by normal galaxies [41]. For 10 of them redshifts are found to be typically 1 - 3. For\nmany bright bursts, which are most probably at small distances, no host galaxies have been\nfound. For example, for 16 bright bursts observed by the Interplanetary Network with small\nerror boxes, no galaxies are found with magnitudes from 20 to 24. This suggests that some\nof the GRBs are not hosted by galaxies.\nIn our model, the fraction of loops captured by galaxes is expected to be small, due to\nthe high velocities of the loops. The most straightforward way to reconcile the model with\nobservations is to assume that cusps are responsible only for a subset of the observed GRBs\nnot associated with galaxies. Such a subset could include the short-duration GRBs, for which\nno host galaxies have yet been detected. With the choice of parameters B\u22127 \u223c 3, \u03b1\u22128 \u223c 0.3,\nas in Section III, the distribution of GRB durations is peaked at \u03c4GRB \u223c 0.5 s. At the same\ntime, the tail of the distribution extends all the way to \u03c4GRB \u223c 103 s, and thus the model\ncan account for some of the long GRBs as well. This particular possibility meets another\nproblem, since short GRBs do not show deviation from Euclidean distribution. However,\nit is often suggested that GRBs comprise a few subclasses, and the existence of a no-host\nsubclass remains plausible.\nAn alternative possibility should be also mentined. In string evolution models with\n\u03b1 \u226b kg G\u03bc, the lifetime of the loops is \u03c4l \u226b t, so the loops will be slowed down by the\nexpansion of the universe and a substantial fraction of them can be captured in galaxies.\n(iv) Bursts of gravitational radiation\nOur model predicts that GRBs should be accompanied by strong bursts of gravitational\nradiation (see also [42]). The angular distribution of the gravitational wave energy around\nthe direction of the cusp is [43] dEg /d\u03a9 \u223c G\u03bc2 l/\u03b8, and the dimensionless amplitude of a\nburst of duration \u03c4 originating at redshift z can be estimated as\nh \u223c kg\u22121/2 \u03b15/3 (\u03c4 /t0 )1/3 (1 + z)\u22121/3 z \u22121 ,\n\n(34)\n\n5/3\n< 1. Here, we have used the relation Fg \u223c h2 /G\u03c4 2 \u223c\nor h \u223c 10\u221221 \u03b1\u22128 z \u22121 (\u03c4 /1s)1/3 for z \u223c\n\n20\n\n\f(1 + z)(dEg /d\u03a9)/d2L \u03c4 for the gravitational wave flux and Eq.(18) for the burst duration \u03c4 .\nThese gravitational wave bursts are much stronger than expected from more conventional\nsources and should be detectable by the planned LIGO, VIRGO and LISA detectors. It has\nbeen shown in [42] that gravitational wave bursts from strings are linearly polarized and\nhave a characteristic waveform h(t) \u221d t1/3 .\n(v) X- and \u03b3- ray diffuse radiation\nTremendous energy [see Eq.(16)] released in a narrow angle \u03b8 \u223c 1/\u03b3max is not seen in\nGRBs because of the smallness of this angle. The beam of particles accelerated by e-m\nradiation in this narrow cone has a very large Lorentz factor, and the emitted photons\nhave energies in excess of 1 TeV. These photons are absorbed in collisions with infrared\n(IR) or microwave photons, collectively denoted as \u03b3t : \u03b3 + \u03b3t \u2192 e+ + e\u2212 . Electrons and\npositrons start e-m cascades on microwave photons (\u03b3bb ) due to Inverse Compton scattering\n(e+\u03b3bb \u2192 e+\u03b3) and pair production (\u03b3 +\u03b3bb \u2192 e+ +e\u2212 ). As they degrade in energy, cascade\nelectrons are effectively deflected in the extragalactic magnetic field, and the produced diffuse\ngamma radiation is isotropic. The spectrum of remaining cascade photons was calculated\nanalytically in [44] (for recent Monte Carlo simulation see [45]). The analytic spectrum is\ndescribed in terms of three parameters: \u01eb\u03b3 , \u01ebX and \u03c9\u03b3 .\n\u01eb\u03b3 is the minimum energy of absorption, i.e. the smallest energy of a photon absorbed on\nIR radiation (\u01eb\u03b3 \u223c m2e /\u03b5IR , with the exact value dependent on the spectrum of IR radiation).\n\u01ebX is the energy of an IC photon produced by an electron of energy \u01ebe = \u01eb\u03b3 /2, i.e. by an\nelectron born by a photon of energy \u01eb\u03b3 . \u03c9\u03b3 is the energy density of cascade radiation.\nThe space density of cascade photons, n\u03b3 (E), is given by [44]\n\nn\u03b3 (E) =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\nK(E/\u01ebX )\u22123/2 if E \u2264 \u01ebX\nK(E/\u01ebX )\u22122\n\nif \u01ebX \u2264 E \u2264 \u01eb\u03b3\n\n0\n\nif E > \u01eb\u03b3\n\nwhere K is a normalization constant which can be expressed in terms of \u03c9cas as\n21\n\n(35)\n\n\fK=\n\n\u01eb2X (2\n\n\u03c9cas\n+ ln \u01eb\u03b3 /\u01ebX )\n\n(36)\n\nThe cascade energy density \u03c9cas can be calculated as the total energy release in e-m radiation\nof cusps integrated over redshits from 0 up to zB = 4. This gives\n\u03c9cas = 5fB kem e3 \u03b7B0 /t0\n\n(37)\n\nAssuming \u01eb\u03b3 \u2248 100 GeV due to absorption on IR radiation, we obtain \u01ebX \u2248 8.1 MeV. Then\nthe predicted spectrum in the energy range 8 MeV \u2264 E \u2264 100 GeV is\nItheor (E) \u223c 2.5 * 10\n\n\u221210\n\n1/2\n\u03b1\u22128 B\u22127\n\n\u0012\n\nE\n3\n10 MeV\n\n\u0013\u22122\n\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 sr \u22121 MeV \u22121 .\n\n(38)\n\nThis is to be compared with the EGRET flux [46] for the energy range 5 MeV \u2264 E \u2264\n100 GeV,\nIobs (E) = 1.38 * 10\u22129\n\n\u0012\n\nE\n103 MeV\n\n\u0013\u22122.1\u00b10.03\n\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 sr \u22121 MeV \u22121 .\n\n(39)\n\nWith \u03b1\u22128 \u223c 0.3 and B\u22127 \u223c 3 the predicted flux differs from the observed one by a factor\nof 3. This can be regarded as agreement for an order of magnitude estimate of our simple\nmodel.\n\n(vi) Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays\nGRBs have been suggested as possible sources of the observed ultrahigh-energy cosmic\nrays (UHECR) [47,48]. This idea encounters two difficulties. First, if GRBs are distributed\nuniformly in the universe, UHECR have a classical Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff,\nabsent in the observations. Second, the acceleration by an ultrarelativistic shock is possible\nonly in the one-loop regime (i.e. due to a single reflection from the shock) [49]. For a\nstandard GRB with a Lorentz factor \u03b3sh \u223c 300 it results in the maximum energy Emax \u223c\n2\n\u03b3sh\nmp \u223c 1014 eV , far too low for UHECR.\n\nOur model can resolve both of these difficulties, assuming that \u03b3max is determined by the\ncurrent backreaction, Eq.(10).\n22\n\n\fIf the magnetic field in the Local Supercluster (LS) is considerably stronger than outside,\nthen the cusps in LS are more powerful and the GZK cutoff is less pronounced.\nCusp segments with large Lorentz factors produce hydrodinamical flows with large\n2\nLorentz factors, e.g., \u03b3 \u223c 2*104 corresponds to \u03b3CD \u223c 3*105 and Emax \u223c \u03b3CD\nmp \u223c 1*1020 eV .\n\nProtons with such energies are deflected in the magnetic field of LS and can be observed,\n> 105 are\nwhile protons with much higher energies caused by near-cusp segments with \u03b3 \u223c\npropagating rectilinearly and generally are not seen. A quantitative analysis of the UHECR\nflux in this scenario will be given elsewhere.\n\nVI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe nature of GRB engines is still unknown. There are observational indications that\nthey are astrophysical objects: about 25 GRBs are reliably found to be located in galaxies,\nprobably in regions of star formation; at least in one case GRB is identified with a supernova\n(SN 1998 bw). The most popular now are astrophysical models, with binary neutron star\nmergers [50], failed supernova [51], hypernova [52] and supranova [53] being the front runners\n(for a critical review see [54]). All these models, however, are not developed enough to give\nquantitative predictions. They also share the difficulty with explaining the large beaming\nfactor required for GRBs.\nIn contrast, the cosmic string model presented here allows one to obtain quantitative\npredictions for the main observational characteristics of GRBs. In this paper we developed a\ndeliberately simplified model, which is characterized by a single free parameter (the energy\nscale \u03b7 of symmetry breaking, or \u03b1 = kg G\u03b7 2 ) and by three other physical quantities, relatively\nwell restricted (the magnetic field in filaments and sheets B0 , the epoch of galaxy formation\nzB , and the density of baryonic matter in the filaments and sheets, a quantity not critical\nfor the predictions). Nevertheless, the model correctly accounts for the GRB rate, and for\nthe range of GRB fluences and durations. It may also explain the short-time structure of\n23\n\n\fGRBs, the diffuse X- and \u03b3-ray backgrounds, and the ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays.\nThe string model predicts recurrence of GRBs with a period of Tl \u223c 50\u03b1\u22128 (1 + z)\u22121/2\nyrs. Very short bursts may have much shorter recurrence periods, perhaps as short as a\nfew years. Observation of these repeaters is a challenge for the future detectors with a high\nefficiency for detection of short bursts.\nAnother testable prediction of the model is that GRBs should be accompanied by strong\nbursts of gravitational radiation with a characteristic waveform.\nIt must be emphasized that our model involves a number of simplifying assumptions.\nAll loops at cosmic time t were assumed to have the same length l \u223c \u03b1t with \u03b1 \u223c kg G\u03b7 2 ,\nwhile in reality there should be a distribution n(l, t). The evolution law (15) for B(z) and\nthe assumption of fB = const are also oversimplified. A more realistic model should also\naccount for a spatial variation of B. Being basically a one-parameter model, our model may\n\u22121\npredict spurious correlations between the GRB characteristics. In particular, the S \u221d \u03c4GRB\n\ncorrelation, suggested by Eq.(23), holds only at a fixed redshift and tends to be washed out\nwhen the redshit distribution, the loop length distribution n(l, t), and the inhomogeneous\nspatial distribution of the magnetic field are taken into account.\nOur model meets basically one difficulty: it predicts too low GRB rate from galaxies.\nThis discrepancy could be explained if our model strongly underestimates the capture rate of\nstring loops by galaxies. For example, if \u03b1 \u226b kg G\u03bc, then the loops are non-relativistic and\nmay be effectively captured by galaxies. Another possibility is that our model could describe\nsome subclass of the sources not associated with galaxies. Such a subclass could include the\nshort-duration GRBs for which host galaxies are not found. In this case, the model needs a\nsmaller \u03b1, as discussed in section IIIB. In contrast to the prediction of our model, the short\nbursts do not show strong deviation from the Euclidean distribution. This could be due to\nobservational selection effects, since the faint short-duration GRBs which form this subclass\nhave a low detection efficiency in BATSE. Alternatively, it could be another subclass of\n\n24\n\n\fno-host GRBs.\nOn the other hand, GRBs from cusps have properties which distinctly distinguish\nthem from those produced by collapsars: they are periodically repeating on the scale of\na few decades for majority of GRBs and on the scale of a few years for faint bursts\n< 10\u22128 erg/cm2 ) with short duration \u03c4GRB < 20 ms. The next generation of GRB\n(S \u223c\n\u223c\ndetectors can examine this prediction.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\nWe are grateful to Roger Blandford, Ken Olum and Bohdan Paczynski for useful discussions.
