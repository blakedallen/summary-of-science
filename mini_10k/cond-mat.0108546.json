If the representative configuration\nis crossing a ridge separating different PES basins, some\nof the local curvatures are negative. A computationallyexpensive but well-defined screening procedure to sort\nout the negative-curvature directions contributing to diffusion [7] has been developed [22,23,14]. For all model\npotentials for which such analysis has been performed,\nit has been shown that the T and density \u03c1 variation\nof fdiff controls the behavior of the long time dynamics,\nsupporting the hypothesis that information about the local properties of the PES may be sufficient to describe\nlong-time dynamical processes.\nThe analysis of the PES connectivity has been limited\nto models for fragile glass-forming liquids and to temperatures above T\u00d7 , due to the difficulty in generating\nequilibrium configurations at low T . In all studied cases,\nit was consistently found that T\u00d7 locates the T at which\nfdiff appears to extrapolate to zero [13,23,14].\nHere, we present an evaluation of the fraction of diffusive directions (using the INM analysis) for the wellstudied BKS model for silica [24], for which we generate\nequilibrium configurations for temperature both above\nand below T\u00d7 . The INM spectrum of BKS silica has\nbeen previously calculated by Benbenek and Laird [25]\nfor equilibrium states above T\u00d7 but no evaluation of fdiff\nwas reported. For the BKS model, the high T dynamics has been shown to be consistent with the predictions\nof MCT at both a qualitative [26] and quantitative [27]\nlevel. At lower T , the T -dependence of the characteristic times [26] shows a crossover toward an Arrhenius T\ndependence which has been interpreted as a clear case of\nfragile-to-strong transition [28]. The crossover temperature T\u00d7 , around 3330 K at \u03c1 = 2.36 g/cm3 , has been\ninterpreted by Horbach et al at as the MCT critical temperature [26]. In the Arrhenius region, the activation\nenergy is 54000K and 60000K , for oxygen and silicon\nrespectively.\nWe find that both the T dependence of the diffusion\nconstant D and of fdiff show a clear signature of the two\ndifferent dynamical behaviors - fragile above and strong\nbelow T\u00d7 -. Despite these differences, the relation between D and fdiff is not sensitive to the presence of dynamical changes. Moreover, we find that fdiff does not\n\nWe present a numerical analysis for SiO2 of the fraction of\ndiffusive direction fdiff for temperatures T on both sides of the\nfragile-to-strong crossover. The T -dependence of fdiff clearly\nreveals this change in dynamical behavior. We find that for T\nabove the crossover (fragile region) the system is always close\nto ridges of the potential energy surface (PES), while below\nthe crossover (strong region), the system mostly explores the\nPES local minima. Despite this difference, the power law\ndependence of fdiff on the diffusion constant, as well as the\npower law dependence of fdiff on the configurational entropy,\nshows no change at the fragile to strong crossover.\n\nPACS numbers: 61.43.Fs, 64.70.Pf, 66.10.Cb\n\nA useful approach for relating dynamics and thermodynamics of glassforming liquids in their supercooled\nstates is offered by the study of the liquid's potential energy surface (PES) [1]. The PES is the multidimensional\nsurface generated by the system's potential energy as a\nfunction of all atomic coordinates. Numerical and theoretical studies [2\u201310] are providing evidence that several\naspects of the liquid dynamics have a clear signature in\nthe properties of the explored regions of the PES. For example, correlation functions display stretching in time in\nthe same temperature (T ) range in which the system explores regions of the PES associated with local minima of\ndeeper and deeper energy [11]. Similarly, the rapid slowing down of the dynamics which takes place in the weakly\nsupercooled region is associated to the exploration of regions of the PES close to saddles of lower and lower order\n[12\u201317]. Recent numerical studies for fragile liquids [18]\nhave suggested the possibility that a cross over T , T\u00d7\nmarks a change in the geometrical properties of the PES\nexplored. In this picture, above T\u00d7 the system trajectories are mostly located close to the ridges between different PES basins (\"border dynamics\"), while below T\u00d7 the\nsystem only rarely samples the regions connecting different PES basins (\"minimum-to-minimum dynamics\"). T\u00d7\nhas been associated [19,20,13,14] with the critical temperature predicted by the ideal mode-coupling theory\n(MCT) [21].\nInstantaneous normal mode (INM) analysis [12] is a\npowerful technique to investigate the connectivity properties of the PES explored at different temperatures. The\n1\n\n\fvanish around T\u00d7 but changes to an Arrhenius T dependence, similar to the T dependence of D. Finally, we\nshow that the number of diffusive directions is related to\nthe number of basins of the PES, providing a possible\nexplanation for the recently-observed validity [4,28,29] of\nthe Adam-Gibbs equation [30] in the T region where border dynamics dominates.\nOur results are based on extensive simulations of a\nsystem of 999 atoms, for \u03c1 = 2.36 g/cm3 , close to the\ndensity of ambient pressure silica. We investigate eleven\nT , in the range from T = 2650K to T = 7000K. We\ncarry out simulations in the NVE ensemble, using a 1 fs\nintegration timestep. We evaluate the long range interaction by implementing the Ewald summation. To guarantee proper equilibrium conditions all simulations lasted\nlonger than several times the slowest collective structural\nrelaxation time; low T runs lasted longer than 50 ns. We\nalso performed averages over eight different realizations.\nFor each studied state point we calculate eigenvalues and\neigenvectors for 96 configurations. For each of the eleven\nT studied, we performed approximately 2600 minimizations, using a total of about 50,000 CPU hours.\nThe INM analysis requires the evaluation of the eigenvectors and associated eigenvalues of the potential energy second derivative matrix, the Hessian. According\nto the procedure described in Refs. [22,31], all eigenvectors associated with negative eigenvalues are inspected\nin order to eliminate those associated with intra-basin\nanharmonicities (\"shoulder\" and \"false barrier\" modes).\nFig. 1 shows (i) the T dependence of the fraction of directions with negative eigenmodes fu ,(ii) the fraction of\ndirections whose one-dimensional profile is double-well\nshaped fdw , and (iii) the number of diffusive directions\nfdiff , calculated by eliminating from the double-well set\nall false barrier modes [22,32]. Above T = 3330K, all\nthree quantities show a fast decrease with T . While\nfu and fdw assume non-zero values, fdiff appears to approach zero on cooling. A clear change of concavity in the\nT dependence of fdiff takes place above T = 3330K. As\nfound previously for fragile liquids for T > T\u00d7 , the fast\ndecrease of fdiff confirms that above T = 3330K: (i) the\nslowing down of dynamics is associated with a progressive\ndecrease of the number of possible directions that lead to\na different basin; (ii) the system trajectories are located\nclose to PES ridges (border dynamics); (iii) even for BKS\nsilica, the dynamics properly described by the ideal MCT\nare border dynamics, supporting the identification of T\u00d7\nwith the MCT critical temperature.\nFor T below 3330K, the system spends most of the\ntime far from the PES ridges. To support this statement, Fig. 2 shows the probability P (fdiff ) of finding a\nconfigurations with a specific fdiff value for T = 2800 K\n(< T\u00d7 ) and T = 4000 K (> T\u00d7 ). Above T\u00d7 all examined\nconfigurations have a nonzero fdiff , while below T\u00d7 the\ndistribution is peaked around zero and most of the configurations are characterized by the absence of diffusive\n\ndirections.\nWe next investigate the functional relation between\nfdiff and D. The T dependence of both quantities, shown\nin an Arrhenius plot in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), show a change\nin the T -dependence above and below T\u00d7 . Despite this\ndifferent dynamical behavior, the quantity fdiff is related\nto D by the same power law relation both for T > T\u00d7 and\nfor T < T\u00d7 (Fig.3(c)). In the entire studied T region, D\nfollows the law\nD/T \u223c (fdiff )\u03b1 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwith \u03b1 \u2248 1.3 \u00b1 0.2 over more than two decades in fdiff\nand more then three decades in D/T . The same functional form describes the relationship between D and\nfdiff both above and below T\u00d7 showing that while the\nT dependence of both D and fdiff is sensitive to the\nmicroscopic mechanisms controlling the dynamics, the\nfragile-to-strong transition does not affect in the relation between D and fdiff . We stress also that the same\nfunctional form has been found to describe the relation\nbetween D and fdiff in the case of the extended simple\npoint charge (SPC/E) model for water [14], for which\ncalculations were limited to T > T\u00d7 .\nThe interpretation of the dynamics in terms of the fraction of diffusive directions is complementary to the analysis which attributes the slowing down of the dynamics\nto the decrease of the liquid configurational entropy Sconf\n[30]. In the case of BKS silica, Sconf has been recently\ncalculated and shown to describe, via the Adam-Gibbs\nrelation, the slowing down of the dynamics both above\nand below T\u00d7 [28]. Since Sconf is a measure of the number\nof distinct PES basins explored by the system - if the\ndescription in terms of Sconf and the description in terms\nof fdiff are both valid - a relation must exist between the\nnumber of basins and the number of directions connecting\nthem. Fig.4 shows the relation between Sconf and fdiff for\nthe case of BKS silica. Within the numerical uncertainty,\nthe fraction of diffusive directions appears to be proportional to the number of explored basins, \u03a9 \u2261 eSconf/kB ,\nirrespective of the strong or fragile character of the dynamics. Data in Fig.4 are consistent with similar findings\nwhich were limited to the SPC/E model for water to the\nT -region above T\u00d7 . The present results suggest that the\nlinear relation between log fdiff and Sconf is not model\ndependent; indeed it has been recently derived within\nthe random energy model [33]. The fact that this relation holds even above T\u00d7 is particularly interesting; since\nabove T\u00d7 the system dynamics is a dynamics of borders,\nthere is no clear reason why such border dynamics should\nbe well described by the Adam-Gibbs relation which focuses on the number of basins explored as a function of\nT . The observed relation between log fdiff and Sconf may\noffer a key for the resolution of this apparent paradox. It\nis a challenge for future studies to find out if fdiff is a potentially richer quantity for describing dynamics in deep\n2\n\n\fsupercooled states, as the results reported here seem to\nsuggest.\nWe thank W.

Modes which contribute to the\npeak located at \"large\" d \u2248 0.01 nm are classified as\ndiffusive modes (fdiff ).

The\ndistribution of distances is not centered at zero, but centered around 10\u22125 nm, due to numerical uncertainties\nin the exact location of the local minimum during the\nminimization procedure.
