Inside this band the entries {Hij , i \u2264 j} are given by independent\nidentically distributed gaussian random variables with zero mean value and\nvariance v 2 /b.\nWe study asymptotic behavior of the spectral norm kH (N,b) k in the limit\nN \u2192 \u221e when the band width b is much smaller than the matrix size N\nbut also tends to infinity. Our main result is that if b/(log N )3 \u2192 \u221e, then\nlim supN,b kH (N,b)k is bounded by 2v with probability 1. To prove this, we de(N,b)\n\nrive a system of recurrent relations for the moments M2k\nrelations in the limit when k goes to infinity as N \u2192 \u221e.\n\n1\n\nand analize these\n\nRandom matrices and eigenvalue distribution\n\nRandom matrices of infinitely increasing dimensions N \u2192 \u221e were considered first\nin theoretical physics. Physics serves as the source of new questions and results here\nand the development of the random matrix theory reveals many relations between\nrandom matrices and other branches of mathematics (see the special issue on physics\nand mathematics of random matrix theory of the Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and General, vol. 36 (2003)). In these studies, the special attention is paid to\nthe extreme eigenvalues of N \u00d7 N hermitian random matrices with unitary invariant\nprobability distribution. Recent progress in this field relates random matrix theory\nwith nonlinear differential equations and integrable systems (the pioneering mathematical results are obtained in [23]); from another hand the probability law of the\n(N )\nmaximal eigenvalue of random hermitian matrices lmax is asymptotically equivalent\nto that of the longest increasing subsequence in the random permutation of 1, . . . , N\n1\n\n\f(see e.g. [1, 14]). These results motivate extended studies of extreme values of\nrandom matrix ensembles.\nIn present paper we study asymptotic behavior of lmax of the ensemble of band\nrandom matrices. This ensemble plays an important role in the quantum chaos\ntheory (see e.g. [12]). The probability distribution of this ensemble is not invariant\nwith respect to the unitary transformations.\n\n1.1\n\nWigner ensemble and the semicircle law\n\nThe spectral theory of random matrices was started half a century ago by E. Wigner\n(see e.g. [24]). He studied the eigenvalue distribution of the ensemble of N \u00d7 N real\nsymmetric random matrices W (N ) of the form\n\u0010\n\nW (N )\n\n1\n= \u221a wij ,\nN\n\n\u0011\n\nij\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere {wij , i \u2264 j} are independent random variables. The main proposition proved\nin [24] is that if wij are centered random variables of the variance v 2 , odd moments\nzero and all even moments finite, then the normalized eigenvalue counting function\nof W (N ) defined by the formula\n(N )\n\n\u03c3N (l) = #{lj\n(N )\n\n\u2264 l}N \u22121 ,\n\n(N )\n\nwhere l1 \u2264 . . . \u2264 lN are eigenvalues of W (N ) , weakly converges in average to the\nlimiting function \u03c3(l; 2v)\nlim \u03c3N (l) = \u03c3(l; 2v)\n(1.2)\nN \u2192\u221e\n\nwith the density of the semicircle form;\n\u03c3 \u2032 (l; 2v) = \u03c1(l; 2v) =\n\n1\n2\u03c0v 2\n\n\u001a\u221a\n\n4v 2 \u2212 l2 , if |l| \u2264 2v,\n0,\notherwise.\n\n(1.3)\n\nThis statement is known as the semicircle (or Wigner) law. In particular, Wigner\nhas shown that the moments of the limiting distribution m2k are determined by\nrecurrent relations\nm2k = v 2\n\nk\u22121\nX\n\nm2k\u22122\u22122j m2j ,\n\nj0\n\nObviously, m2k+1 = 0.\n\n2\n\nm0 = 1.\n\n(1.4)\n\n\f1.2\n\nGaussian Unitary (Invariant) Ensemble\n\nIf one considers the ensemble of N \u00d7 N hermitian matrices\n1\n(H (N ) )ij = \u221a hij ,\nN\n\n(1.5)\n\nwhere hij = \u03b1ij + i\u03b2ij , i \u2264 j are jointly independent complex gaussian random\nvariables with zero mean values and variance v 2 , the density of the probability\ndistribution of H (N ) = H can be written in the form\n\u22121\nZN\nexp{\u2212\n\nN\nTr H 2 },\n2v 2\n\n(1.6)\n\nwhere ZN is the normalization constant. Note that in this case random variables \u03b1\nand \u03b2 are jointly independent (for more details, see section 5 of the present article).\nThe probability distribution (1.6) is invariant with respect to the unitary transformations. Therefore the random matrix ensemble (1.5)-(1.6) is referred to as the\nGaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) of random matrices. It plays the central role in\nthe spectral theory of random matrices (see e.g. [20]).\nIt is easy to see that {H (N ) } verifies the conditions imposed on {W (N ) } and\ntherefore the semicircle law (1.2)-(1.3) is valid for GUE. Moreover, convergence\n(1.2) holds with probability 1 in this case. The first study of the maximal eigenvalue\nlmax (H (N ) ) = kH (N ) k was carried out by S. Geman [11] for the ensemble of real\nsymmetric matrices having the probability distribution of the form (1.6). This ensemble is known as the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) of random matrices.\nGeman has proved that lmax (H (N ) ) converges with probability 1 as N \u2192 \u221e to the\nborder 2v of the support of d\u03c3(l; 2v).\n\n2\n\nBand random matrices\n\nGiven a parameter b, let us consider hermitian random matrices H (N,b) of the form\nq\n\n(b)\n\n(N,b)\n= hxy \u03a8xy ,\nHxy\n\nx, y = 1, . . . , N,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere {hxy , x \u2264 y} are the same as in (1.5) with the law (1.6) and\n\u03a8(b)\nxy\nwhere\n\u03c8(t) =\n\nx\u2212y\n1\n,\n= \u03c8\nb\nb\n\u0012\n\n\u001a\n\n1,\n0,\n\n\u0013\n\nif |t| \u2264 1/2,\n.\notherwise\n3\n\n(2.2)\n\n\fThe ensemble of band random matrices (2.1)-(2.2) was considered in relation\nto the quantum chaos theory and solid state physics (see [8, 12, 10]). The most\nintriguing question was that the ratio b2 /N separates two major asymptotic regimes\nthat characterize behavior of certain spectral characteristics of random matrices.\nIn paper [17], the real symmetric analog of (2.1) is considered. It is proved\nthat in the limit b \u2192 \u221e, b = o(N ) the Wigner law is valid, i.e. the normalized\neigenvalue counting function \u03c3N,b (l) of H (N,b) weakly converges in probability to the\nsemi-circle distribution (see also papers [7, 18, 21] for this and related result). The\nsame proposition can be easily proved for the ensemble of hermitian band random\nmatrices. If b = O(N \u03b3 ) with some \u03b3 > 0, then the convergence of \u03c3N,b to the\nsemicircle distribution holds with probability 1.\nMuch less is known about the limiting behavior of the spectral norm kH (N,b) k =\n(N,b)\nlmax of band random matrices. Up to our knowledge, this question was addressed\nin paper [3] only. If one looks at the computations presented in [3], one can easily\nsee that kH (N,b) k \u2192 \u221e as b = o(log N ), b \u2192 \u221e. In present paper we show that\nif b goes to infinity faster than (log N )3 , then the spectral norm of band random\nmatrices remains bounded by 2v.\nOur main result is given by the following proposition.\nTheorem 2.1.\nIf N and b go to infinity in the way such that b/(log N )3 \u2192 \u221e, then the spectral\nnorm kH (N,b) k remains bounded with probability 1;\nlim sup kH (N,b) k \u2264 2v.\n\n(2.4)\n\nN,b\u2192\u221e\n\nIf b = O(N \u03b3 ) with \u03b3 > 0, then (2.4) turns to equality.\nTo study the spectral norm of random matrices H, we employ the general approach used first by S. Geman by suggestion of U. Grenander [11]. Later it was\nemployed by many authors in applications to various random matrix ensembles with\njointly independent entries [2, 9, 15] and also for random matrices whose elements\nare statistically dependent random variables [4]. The key observation is that if one\nconsiders the moments\n\u001b\n\u001a\n1\n(N )\nTr [H (N ) ]2k\nM2k = E\nN\n(N )\n\nin the limit N \u2192 \u221e, k = O(log N ), then the leading contribution to M2k will be\ngiven by the maximal eigenvalue of lmax (H).\nThe next important step was made in [5]. It was observed that to study the\n(N )\nlimiting behavior of the moments M2k of the Wigner ensemble (1.1), it is not\n4\n\n\fnecessary to compute them explicitly. It is sufficient to show that they verify a\nsystem of recurrent relations that converges as N, k \u2192 \u221e to the system of equalities\n(1.4) that determines the moments of the semicircle law.\nIn paper [4] we have developed a method of derivation and study the recurrent\nrelations for the moments M2k in the case when the matrix elements are gaussian\ncorrelated random variables. In present paper we develop a new version of this\nmethod that we adapt to the band random matrix ensemble. Also we present more\nprecise analysis of these relations aiming the best possible estimates of the moments\n(N,b)\nof H (N,b) .\nM2k\nWe start with the basic example of the GUE (see Section 3). We pay much\n(N,b)\nattention to this ensemble because the relations and estimates of the moments M2k\nare very similar to those of GUE. Thus, the estimates we get in the GUE case are\ntrue for the moments of the band random matrices. We did not manage to get the\n(N )\noptimal estimates for M2k obtained by other methods. The benefit of the approach\ndeveloped is that it can be applied for random matrix ensembles different from GUE.\nIn Section 4 we modify our approach and study the band random matrices. These\ncomputations lead to the proof of Theorem 2.1. In Section 5 we prove auxiliary\nstatements.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nMoments of GUE matrices\nRecurrent relations\n\nIn this section we derive two main recurrent relations for the moments of H (N,b) and\ntheir variances. Let us consider the normalized trace La = N1 Tr H a and compute\nthe mathematical expectation with respect to the Gaussian measure (1.4) of the\nfollowing expression, where G denotes some regular function of H:\nE {La G} =\n\nN\n1 X\na\u22121\nE {Hxs Hsx\nG}.\nN x,s=1\n\nRegarding the last average, we can use the integration by parts formula\na\u22121\nE {Hxs Hsx\nG}\n\n2\n\n= E {|Hxs | } E\n\n(\n\na\u22121 G\n\u2202Hsx\n\u2202Hsx\n\n)\n\n.\n\nThe use of the partial derivative symbol is explained in section 5.\nThen we can write that\nE {La G} =\n\nN Xh\ni\nv2 X\na\u22122\u2212j j\na\u22121\nE\n{H\nH\nR}\n+\nE\n{H\n\u2202G/\u2202H\n}\n=\nsx\nss\nxx\nsx\nN 2 x,s=1 j=0\n\n5\n\n(3.1)\n\n\fv2\n\na\u22122\nX\nj=0\n\nN\nv2 X\na\u22121\nE {Hsx\n\u2202G/\u2202Hsx }.\nN 2 x,s=1\n\nE {La\u22122\u2212j Lj G} +\n\nIf G = 1 and a = 2k, then we get the following relation\nE L2k = v 2\n\n2k\u22122\nX\nj=0\n\nE {L2k\u22122\u2212j Lj } .\n\nDenoting Lo = L \u2212 E L, we can write that\nE {La1 La2 } = E La1 E La2 + Da(2)\n,\n1 ,a2\n\nDa(2)\n= E {Loa1 Loa2 }.\n1 ,a2\n\n(N )\n\nThen using the fact that M2k+1 = E L2k+1 = 0 (see Section 5), we obtain our first\nequality\n(N )\n\nM2k = v 2\n\nk\u22121\nX\n\n(N )\n\n(N )\n\nM2k\u22122\u22122j M2j + v 2\n\nj=0\n\nDa(2)\n1 ,a2\n\nX\n\n(3.2)\n\na1 +a2 =2k\u22122\n\nthat form the system of recurrent relations.

Let us consider the plane of positive integers, i.e. the set of points B =\n{(l, p) : l, p \u2208 N}. Actually, B is a quarter-plane.\n(q)\nWe say that the random variable Da1 ,...,aq with given Aq = (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1q ) belongs\nto the point (2k, q) \u2208 B, if the sum of a's is equal to 2k. We call such variables D\nthe elements of (2k, q). Obviously, 2 \u2264 q \u2264 l, l = 2k and we restrict ourselves with\nthe corresponding subdomain B\u0303 of B.\nIt follows from relations (3.3) that the elements D of (2k, q) are expressed in\nterms of the elements D belonging to one of the four other points: (2k \u2212 2, q),\n(2k \u2212 2, q + 1), (2k \u2212 2, q \u2212 1) and (2k \u2212 2, q \u2212 2). If any of these points is situated\noutside of the domain B\u0303, then the corresponding term in (3.3) is equal to zero and\ngives no contribution. On figure 1 we represent three possible situations. The fact\n7\n\n\fq\n\n4\n3\n2\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\nk\n\nFigure 1: The quarter-plane of recurrent relations for D\nthat the element of (2k, q) is expressed in terms of other elements is reflected by a\nflesh. Let us note that the right-hand side of (3.3) uses also the moments M2l with\n2l \u2264 2k \u2212 2. So, the flesh lines directed from points (2k, *) to (2k \u2212 2, *) also indicate\nthe dependence of D on M .\nSuppose we want to prove the estimate (3.6) for the elements D of the point\n\u2032\n(2k , q \u2032 ) with given k\u2032 and q \u2032 . On Figure 1 this is the point (10,5). We assume that\nthese estimates are true for the elements D of all points (2k\u2032\u2032 , q \u2032\u2032 ) that belong to the\ntriangle 2k\u2032\u2032 + q \u2032\u2032 < 2k\u2032 + q \u2032 and of those situated on the line 2k\u2032\u2032 + q \u2032\u2032 = 2k\u2032 + q \u2032 with\n2k\u2032\u2032 \u2264 2k\u2032 \u2212 2. On Figure 1 we marked these points by fat circles. Also we assume\nthat (3.5) holds for all M2l with 2l \u2264 2k\u2032 \u2212 2 + q \u2032 . Then we use relations (3.3) to\ndeduce the estimate (3.6) for the point (2k\u2032 , q \u2032 ).\nSo, starting with the point (2, 2), we obtain the estimates (3.6) for the elements\nof (4, 3) and (4, 2). Then we go step by step over the points of B\u0303 until we reach\nthe point (2k\u2032 , q \u2032 ) = (10, 5). The next points are (12,4), (14,3) and so on. On this\nway we proceed along the line 2k\u2032\u2032 + q \u2032\u2032 = 2k\u2032 + q \u2032 until q \u2032\u2032 = 2 (the point (16,2) on\nFigure 1). Using (3.2), we prove the estimate (3.2) for M2k\u2032 +q\u2032 . Then we complete\nthe next line starting from the point (10,6).\nComputationally this recurrent procedure means that we assume that all terms\nof the right-hand side of (3.3) verify inequalities (3.5) and (3.6) and then estimate\ntheir sum to show that it is less than the expression corresponding to the term of\nthe left-hand side of (3.3). The same is true for (3.2) with the initial point of the\n(N )\n(N )\nrecurrence M0 = 1. We note also that M2 = v 2 that obviously verifies (3.5)\n(2)\nwith k = 1 because m2 = v 2 . Let us have a look at D1,1 that serves as the initial\n\n8\n\n\fpoint for (3.3). It is easy to see that\n\u001a\n\n(2)\n\nD1,1 = E\n\n1\n1\nTr H\nTr H\nN\nN\n\n\u001b\n\n=\n\nv2\nN2\n\n(3.7)\n\nthat certainly satisfies (3.6).\nNow let us consider (3.2). We want to show that if (3.5) and (3.6) are valid for\n(N )\nthe terms of the right-hand side of (3.2), then (3.5) is valid for M2k .

Let us consider two first terms of the right-hand side of (3.4).\n\n9\n\n\fRepeating calculations that lead to (3.7), we can write that the sum of the first two\nterms is estimated by\nv 2 a2 * * * aq\nNq\n\n4k3\n1+ 2\nN\n\n\uf8f9\n!k\u22121 \uf8eea \u22123\naX\n1\n1 \u22123\nX\n\uf8f0\n(a1 \u2212 2 \u2212 j) mj m2k\u22122\u2212j +\nj ma1 \u22122\u2212j m2k\u2212a1 +j \uf8fb\nj=1\n\nj=1\n\nThe terms in square brackets represent the first and the third parts of the sum\n[(a1 \u2212 3) * m1 m2k\u22123 + . . . + 2ma1 \u22124 m2k\u2212a1 +2 + 1 * ma1 \u22123 m2k\u2212a1 +1 ] +\n{ma1 \u22122 m2k\u2212a1 + ma1 \u22121 m2k\u2212a1 \u22121 + . . . + m2k\u2212a1 ma1 \u22122 } +\n[1 * m2k\u2212a1 +1 ma1 \u22123 + 2m2k\u2212a1 +2 ma1 \u22124 + . . . + (a1 \u2212 3)m2k\u22123 m1 ] \u2264\n(a1 \u2212 3)\n\n2k\u22123\nX\n\nmj \u2032 m2k\u22122\u2212j \u2032 .\n\nj \u2032 =1\n\nCertainly, all the sums run over even numbers, but we do not care about this because\nm2j+1 = 0 and all relations are still true when regarding the sums over even and\nodd numbers.

It was shown that the\nfraction k3 /N 2 is really the optimal one in the sense that one cannot decrease the\nexponent of k and increase that of N in (3.16).\nBasing on the relations (3.2) and (3.3), we did not manage to obtain estimates\nas precise as (3.16).

Therefore the positive counterpart is that our approach is\napplicable for more general ensembles of random matrices than the GUE. In the\nnext section we show how our approach works in the case of band random matrices.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nMoments of band random matrices\nMain technical proposition and proof of Theorem 2.1\n\nOur main goal is to study the moments\n(N )\nMk\n\n=E\n\n\u001a\n\n1\nTr [H (N,b) ]k ,\nN\n\u001b\n\n(4.1)\n(N,b)\n\nwhere H (N,b) are given by matrices (2.1). The first observation is that M2k+1 = 0\n(N,b)\n\n(see Lemma 5.2 of section 5). Thus we can consider the even moments M2k only.\nThe next observation is that in the case of band random matrices we cannot derive\nrecurrent relations for M2k themselves as it was for the case of GUE. Instead we\nfind a family of random variables that make a close system. Let us start with the\nrandom variables\nLk (x) = L(N,b)\n= [H (N,b) ]kxx .\nx\nUsing integration by parts formula (see section 5), it is not hard to show that the\nmathematical expectation of L verifies the following identity\nE L2k (x) = v 2\n\n2k\u22121\nX\nj=0\n\nwhere we denoted\n\nE {L2k\u22122\u2212j (x)Lj [x]},\n\n(4.2)\n\nN\ns\u2212x\n1X\nLj (s) \u03c8\n.\nLj [x] =\nb s=1\nb\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nOne can say that Lj [x] represents a partial trace of H j normalized by b. So, one can\nexpect that the variance of L goes to zero when b \u2192 \u221e and that the mathematical\nexpectation in the right-hand side of (4.2) factorizes. In what follows, we prove this\nfactorization and estimate the variance of L[x].\n(N,b)\nRegarding mathematical expectation M2k (x) = E Lx (k), we obtain equality\n(N,b)\n\nM2k\n\n(x) = v 2\n\nk\u22121\nX\n\n(N,b)\n\n(N,b)\n\nM2k\u22122\u22122j (x) M2j\n\nj=0\n\n13\n\n(2)\n\n[x] + v 2 D2k\u22122 (x),\n\n(4.3)\n\n\fwhere\n\n(2)\n\nD2k\u22122 (x) =\n\nX\n\na1 +a2 =2k\u22122\n\nLo\n\nE {Loa1 (x)Loa2 [x]}.\n\nWe recall that\n= L \u2212 E L.\nIn the next subsection we will prove Lemma 4.1 that implies the following estimates that are true for all 2k \u2264 b1/3 :\nsup\nx=1,...,N\n\n(N,b)\nM2k (x)\n\n\u2264\n\n4k3\n1+ 2\nb\n\n!k\n\nm2k ,\n\n(4.4)\n\nwhere the family {m2k }k\u2208N determines the semicircle law (1.2).\nIt follows from (4.4) that\n(N,b)\nM2k\n\nN\n1 X\n(N )\n=\nM (x) \u2264\nN x=1 2k\n\n4k3\n1+ 2\nb\n\n!k\n\nm2k\n\n(4.5)\n\nUsing the estimate (3.14), we see that\n(N,b)\nProb{lmax\n\u2265 2v(1 + \u03b5)} \u2264\n\nN\n(1 + \u03b5)k\n\nfor all k \u2264 b1/3 provided 4k3 /b2 \u2264 \u03b5. Choosing k such that k/ log N \u2192 \u221e, we obtain\nthe bound\nlim sup max |l(N,b) | \u2264 2v\n(4.6)\nN \u2192\u221e j=1,...N\n\nwith probability 1 provided b \u2265 (log N )3 . Theorem 2.1 follows form (4.6).\n\n4.2\n\nRecurrent relations for the generalized moments\n\nLet us introduce random variables that serve as the elementary blocks for the closed\nsystem of recurrent relations. These are the products\n\u0010\n\nLR(a) (x) = H \u03b11 \u03a8(y1 ) H \u03b12 * * * H \u03b1r\u22121 \u03a8(yr\u22121 ) H \u03b1r\n\n\u0011\n\nxx\n\n,\n\nwhere R is given by two r-dimensional vectors A and Y ; Ar = (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1r ), \u03b11 +\n. . . + \u03b1r = a, Yr = (y1 , . . . , yr ), yi \u2208 {1, . . . , N }, and \u03a8(y) represents a diagonal\nN -dimensional matrix [\u03a8(y) ]st = \u03b4st \u03c8((s \u2212 y)/b).\nIn section 5 (see Lemma 5.2) we prove that\nE LR(a) = 0\n\nif a = 2k + 1.\n14\n\n(4.7)\n\n\fIn present section we prove the following proposition.\nLemma 4.1 If 2k \u2264 b1/3 , then\n0 \u2264 E LR(a) \u2264\n\n!k\n\n4k3\n1+ 2\nb\n\nm2k\n\nif\n\na = 2k,\n\n(4.8)\n\nand\nsup E\nx,y\n\nn\n\nLoR1 (a1 ) (y)\n\no\n\nLoR2 (a2 ) [x] * * * LoRq (aq ) [x]\n\n\u2264\n\n\u001a\n\n\u03a0(Aq ; b) m2k , if |Aq | = 2k,\n0,\nif |Aq | = 2k + 1,\n(4.9)\n\nwhere\na1 a2 * * * aq\n\u03a0(Aq ; b) =\nbq\n\n4k3\n1+ 2\nb\n\n!k\n\nand\n|Aq | = a1 + . . . + aq .\n\nTo prove estimates (4.8) and (4.9), we derive a system of recurrent relations\nthat resemble very much relations (3.2), (3.3), and (4.3). Then we use the recurrent\nprocedure described in subsection 3.2. So, we do not describe the details of the\nderivation but give the general description.\nRegarding LR(a) , one can always assume that \u03b11 > 1.
