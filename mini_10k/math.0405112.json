They\nconstitute a macroscopic quantum phenomenon, and their analysis has already lead\nto an increased understanding of phenomena such as superfluidity and superconductivity. Of particular interest are BECs in optical lattices (periodic potentials),\nwhich have already been used to study Josephson effects [1], squeezed states [49],\nLandau-Zener tunneling and Bloch oscillations [43], and the transition between superfluidity and Mott insulation [61, 13, 24]. With each lattice site occupied by one\nalkali atom in its ground state, BECs in periodic potentials also show promise as\nregisters for quantum computers [57, 63].\nAuthors' note: We rephrased the next paragraph.\nIn the present paper, we generalize recent work on near-autonomous dynamics in\nBECs [52, 53] to study quasiperiodic behavior in BECs in periodic lattices, which can\nhave shallow, intermediate, or deep wells. We present our methodology and results\nin section 1.1. In section 2, we discuss the physics of BECs and use a coherent\nstructure ansatz to derive a parametrically forced Duffing oscillator describing the\n2\n\n\fspatial dynamics of the condensate. The quasiperiodic dynamics of parametrically\nforced Duffing oscillators is rigorously investigated in section 3. Sections 3.1 and 3.2\nthen describe applications to BECs in periodic lattices and periodic superlattices,\nrespectively. The KAM theorem used in this analysis is proven in section 4. Finally,\nwe summarize and discuss our results in section 5.\n\n1.1\n\nMethodology and results\n\nAuthors' note: We rephrased the paragraph below.\nThe spatial dynamics of standing waves in BECs in periodic optical lattices can\nbe described by a parametrically forced Duffing equation, where the periodic forcing\nis given by an external potential due to the lattice [10, 52, 53]. This gives a 1 21 degree\nof freedom Hamiltonian system. We use KAM theory and Aubry-Mather theory to\nstudy its quasiperiodic dynamics. Previous KAM studies in BECs took a heuristic\napproach and considered only near-autonomous situations [53, 52]. The approach of\nthis paper, however, is especially versatile in that shallow, deep, and intermediate\nlattice wells can all be considered using the same mathematical framework. That is,\nwe consider the near-autonomous and far-from-autonomous settings simultaneously.\nTheorem 6 proves that for any (analytic) external periodic potential, any negative two-body scattering length, and any chemical potential, one obtains mostly\n2-quasiperiodic dynamics for condensate wave functions of sufficiently large amplitude, where the minimal amplitude depends on the experimentally adjustable BEC\nparameters. In particular, the threshold amplitude is proportional to the reciprocal\nof the square root of the scattering length. Any 2-quasiperiodic wave function above\nthe threshold has one fixed frequency and one proportional to its amplitude. We\nalso demonstrate numerically that one obtains the same dynamical picture for lattices of all depths, as an increase in lattice amplitude essentially only affects scaling\nin phase space. These numerical results support the theoretically predicted scaling\nof the threshold amplitude. Our theorem applies to periodic superlattices with an\narbitrary number of rationally dependent wave numbers.\nThe system we investigate is given by a Hamiltonian of the form H(R, S, \u03be) =\n1 2\nS\n+U(R, \u03be), where |R| is the amplitude of the wave function, R and S are conjugate\n2\nvariables, \u03be \u2208 R/Z, and \u03be \u2032 = 1. The function U is a polynomial in R and 1-periodic\nin \u03be. We also consider its Poincar\u00e9 map, defined to be the return map on the section\n\u03be = 0.\nOne can show that such systems have invariant tori sufficiently far from the origin\n(R, S) = (0, 0) even when they are far from autonomous (that is, even when H is\na large perturbation of an \u03be-independent system). In the present case, this implies\nthe existence of invariant tori for any optical lattice depth. The key condition is\nthat U(R, \u03be)/R2 \u2192 +\u221e as R \u2192 \u00b1\u221e, as this guarantees that the set of frequencies\ncorresponding to rotation around the origin is unbounded; indeed, the frequency\ngoes to infinity with the distance to the origin. The first result of this type can be\nfound in the equivalent context of adiabatic theory [3]. Another strand goes back\n3\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 1: Phase portraits of the Poincar\u00e9 map P for the example of section 3.1, with\nhorizontal axis R and vertical axis S. In this case, the Hamiltonian is of the form\nH = 12 S 2 \u2212 21 [1+V1 cos(\u03be)]R2 + 14 R4 . Observe the invariant curves for large R in these\nfigures. Generically, the invariant manifolds of the central saddle point intersect\ntransversally, creating a homoclinic tangle and thereby implying the existence of\nhorseshoes of measure zero. By conjecture, the closure of these horseshoes is a\n\"chaotic sea\" of positive measure, corresponding to the dots in the figures. As the\nsize of the perturbation V1 is increased to +\u221e, the size of each of the remaining\nintegrable islands vanishes, but their total measure remains O(1). The values of V1\nare (a) V1 = 0.1, (b) V1 = 0.5, and (c) V1 = 1.\nto the question of boundedness of solutions (which is implied by the existence of\ninvariant tori in this low-dimensional situation) [34]. These qualitative results have\nalso been extended to more general mathematical settings [20, 45, 46, 35, 66, 31, 32].\nAuthors' note: We added Levi91 to the above list of references.\nAuthors' note: The paragraph below was rephrased.\nA typical system of this type exhibits a phase space divided into two clearly\ndistinct regions. See figures 1 \u2013 3, which show numerical experiments in the present\nsetting. One region, bounded away from the origin, consists largely of invariant tori,\nwith small layers of chaotic dynamics between them. Indeed, one can show that the\nmeasure of these layers vanishes exponentially fast as the distance to the origin goes\nto infinity [47, 8]. The other region has mainly chaotic dynamics. In this paper,\nwe employ a quantitative existence result [15] to obtain bounds on the location and\nfrequencies of invariant tori.\n\n2\n\nPhysical Background\n\nAt low temperatures, particles in a dilute boson gas can reside in the same quantum (ground) state, forming a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) [17]. This was first\nobserved experimentally in 1995 with vapors of rubidium and sodium [2, 18]. In\nthese experiments, atoms were confined in magnetic traps, evaporatively cooled to\n4\n\n\f(d)\n\n(e)\n\n(f)\n\nFigure 2: Continuation of figure 1. Phase portraits of the Poincar\u00e9 map P at (d)\nV1 = 10, (e) V1 = 25, and (f) V1 = 100.\n\n(g)\n\n(h)\n\n(i)\n\nFigure 3: Continuation of figure 2. Phase portraits of the Poincar\u00e9 map P at (g)\nV1 = 200, (h) V1 = 1000, and (i) V1 = 10000.\n\n5\n\n\ftemperatures of a few hundred nanokelvin, left to expand by switching off the confining trap, and subsequently imaged with optical methods [17]. A sharp peak in\nthe velocity distribution was observed below a critical temperature, indicating that\ncondensation had occurred. BECs are inhomogeneous, allowing condensation to be\nobserved in both momentum and position space. The number of condensed atoms\nN ranges from several thousand to tens of millions.\nA BEC\np has two characteristic length scales: the harmonic oscillator length\n~/[m\u03c9ho ] (which is about a few microns), where \u03c9ho = (\u03c9x \u03c9y \u03c9z )1/3\naho =\nis the geometric\nmean of the trapping frequencies, and the mean healing length\np\n\u03c7 = 1/ 8\u03c0|a|n\u0304 (which is also about a few microns), where n\u0304 is the mean density\nand a, the (two-body) s-wave scattering length, is determined by the atomic species\nof the condensate. Interactions between atoms are repulsive when a > 0 and attractive when a < 0. For a dilute ideal gas, a \u2248 0. The length scales in BECs should\nbe contrasted with those in systems like superfluid helium, in which the effects of\ninhomogeneity occur on a microscopic scale fixed by the interatomic distance [17].\nWhen considering only two-body interactions, the BEC wave function (\"order\nparameter\") \u03a8(~r, t) satisfies the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation,\n\u0012 2 2\n\u0013\n~ \u2207\n2\ni~\u03a8t = \u2212\n+ g0 |\u03a8| + V(~r) \u03a8 ,\n(1)\n2m\nwhere \u03a8 = \u03a8(~r, t) is the condensate wave function, V(~r) is the external potential,\n2\n2\nand\np the effective interaction constant is g0 = [4\u03c0~ a/m][1 + O(\u03b6 )], where \u03b6 \u2261\n2\n3\n|\u03a8| |a| is the dilute-gas parameter [17, 33]. A BEC is modeled in the quasi-onedimensional (quasi-1D) regime when its transverse dimensions are on the order of\nits healing length and its longitudinal dimension is much larger than its transverse\nones [10, 17]. In the quasi-1D regime, one employs the 1D limit of a 3D mean-field\ntheory rather than a true 1D mean-field theory, which would be appropriate were\nthe transverse dimension on the order of the atomic interaction length or the atomic\nsize. The resulting 1D equation is [17, 60]\ni~\u03c8t = \u2212\n\n~2\n\u03c8xx + g|\u03c8|2\u03c8 + V (x)\u03c8 ,\n2m\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c8, g, and V are, respectively, the rescaled 1D wave function, interaction constant, and external trapping potential. The quantity |\u03c8|2 gives the atomic number\ndensity. The self-interaction parameter g is tunable (even its sign), because the scattering length a can be adjusted using magnetic fields in the vicinity of a Feshbach\nresonance [21, 30].\nPotentials V (x) of interest include harmonic traps, periodic lattices and superlattices (i.e., optical lattices with two or more wave numbers), and periodically\nperturbed harmonic traps. The existence of quasi-1D cylindrical (\"cigar-shaped\")\nBECs motivates the study of periodic potentials without a confining trap along the\ndimension of the periodic lattice [37]. Experimentalists use a weak harmonic trap\non top of the periodic lattice or superlattice to prevent the particles from spilling\n6\n\n\fout. To achieve condensation, the lattice is typically turned on after the trap. If\none wishes to include the trap in theoretical analyses, V (x) is modeled by\nV (x) = V1 cos(\u03ba1 x) + V2 cos(\u03ba2 x) + Vh x2 ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03ba1 is the primary lattice wave number, \u03ba2 > \u03ba1 is the secondary lattice wave\nnumber, V1 and V2 are the associated lattice amplitudes, and Vh represents the\nmagnitude of the harmonic trap. (Note that V1 , V2 , Vh , \u03ba1 , and \u03ba2 can all be tuned\nexperimentally.) When Vh \u226a V1 , V2 , the potential is dominated by its periodic\ncontributions for many periods. BECs in optical lattices with up to 200 wells have\nbeen created experimentally [50].\nIn this work, we let Vh = 0 and focus on periodic lattices and superlattices.\nSpatially periodic potentials have been employed in numerous experimental studies\nof BECs (see, for example, Refs [1, 26]) and have also been studied theoretically\n(see, for example, [10, 12, 38, 65]). In recent experiments, BECs have also been\nloaded successfully into superlattices with \u03ba2 = 3\u03ba1 [51]. Additionally, over the past\ncouple years, there has been an increasing number of theoretical studies on BECs\nin superlattices [22, 36, 54, 55, 16].\nAuthors' note: The next paragraph has been rephrased.\nAs mentioned in section 1.1 and proven below, we obtain bounds on the location\nand frequencies of invariant tori. Our paper establishes quasiperiodic dynamics for\nsufficiently large amplitude. By a slight adaptation of the argument (see remark 10\nbelow), it can be shown that the quasiperiodic dynamics has large measure at large\namplitude. It is generally conjectured that chaotic dynamics exist where invariant\ntori have been destroyed. In the present model, the presence of chaos (which was\nstudied in BECs in, e.g., Refs. [12, 14, 62, 16]) would reflect an irregular spatial\nprofile R(x) (where |R(x)| = |\u03c8(x, t)| is the amplitude of the BEC wave function),\nwhereas invariant tori correspond to regular (i.e., quasiperiodic) spatial profiles.\nmap: how is the phrasing above?\nRemark 1 : When the optical lattice has deep wells (large |V1 | or |V2 |), one can\nalso obtain an analytical description of BECs in terms of Wannier wave functions\nusing the so-called \"tight-binding approximation\" [42]. In this regime, the BEC\ndynamics is governed by a discrete nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which is derived\nby expanding the field operator in a Wannier basis of localized wave functions at\neach lattice site.\nCoherent structures solutions are described with the ansatz\n\u03c8(x, t) = R(x) exp (i [\u03b8(x) \u2212 \u03bct]) ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere R \u2208 R gives the amplitude dynamics of the wave function, \u03b8 gives the phase\ndynamics, and the \"chemical potential\" \u03bc, defined as the energy it takes to add one\nmore particle to the system, is proportional to the number of atoms trapped in the\ncondensate. When the (temporally periodic) coherent structure (4) is also spatially\nperiodic, it is called a modulated amplitude wave (MAW) [53].\n7\n\n\fRemark 2 : The present work is concerned with the spatial amplitude dynamics of\nsolutions of the form (4). To ensure that such solutions are physically relevant, it is\nimportant to examine their stability with respect to the dynamics of the GP equation\n(2). Bronski and coauthors [9, 10, 11] were able to obtain rigorous stability results\nin some situations using elliptic-function potentials. (For repulsive condensates, for\nexample, they used the ansatz (4) to construct elliptic-function solutions to (2),\nwhose linear stability they proved for R(x) > 0 by showing that they were ground\nstates of the GP equation.) Their results can be applied to trigonometric potentials\nby taking the limit as the elliptic modulus approaches zero. More generally, one can\naddress the stability of solutions of the form (4) through direct numerical simulations\nof (2) using such solutions as initial wave functions: \u03c8(x, 0) = R(x). It was shown\npreviously using both lattice and superlattice potentials V (x) that one can obtain\nnumerically stable MAWs for (2) with solutions of the form (4) with trivial phase\n\u03b8 = 0 [54, 56]. Furthermore, the numerically stable \"period-doubled\" solutions\n(whose spatial periodicity is twice that of the optical lattice potential) constructed\nvia subharmonic resonances using the ansatz (4) with trivial phase (\u03b8 = 0) have\nvery recently been observed experimentally [23].\nInserting (4) into the GP equation (2) and equating real and imaginary parts,\none obtains\n\u0014 2\n\u0015\n~2 \u2032\u2032\n~\n2\n\u2032\n2\n~\u03bcR(x) = \u2212\nR (x) +\n[\u03b8 (x)] + gR (x) + V (x) R(x) ,\n(5)\n2m\n2m\n~2\n[2\u03b8\u2032 (x)R\u2032 (x) + \u03b8\u2032\u2032 (x)R(x)] ,\n0=\n2m\nwhich gives the following nonlinear ordinary differential equation:\n2m\u03bcR 2mg 3 2m\nc2\n\u2212\n+ 2 R + 2 V (x)R .\n3\nR\n~\n~\n~\nThe parameter c is defined via the relation\nc\n\u03b8\u2032 (x) = 2\n,\nR (x)\nR\u2032\u2032 =\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\nwhich plays the role of conservation of \"angular momentum,\" as discussed by Bronski\nand coauthors [10]. Constant phase solutions (i.e., standing waves) constitute an\nimportant special case and satisfy c = 0.

Its qualitative dynamics in the physically relevant\nsituation of bounded |R| is illustrated in figure 4. The methodology developed in\nthe present paper can handle attractive BECs (g < 0) with either \u03bc < 0 or \u03bc > 0\nbut not repulsive BECs, as equation (8) has unbounded solutions when g > 0.\n8\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 4: Phase portraits of coherent structures in BECs with no external potential.\nThe signs of \u03bc and g determine the dynamics of (8). (a) Repulsive BEC with\n\u03bc > 0. Orbits inside the separatrix have bounded amplitude |R(x)|. The period of\nsuch orbits increases as one approaches the separatrix. In this case, the dynamical\nsystem can be rescaled so that R\u2032\u2032 = \u2212R + R3 . (b) Attractive BEC with \u03bc > 0.\nThe dynamical system can be rescaled so that R\u2032\u2032 = \u2212R \u2212 R3 . (c) Attractive BEC\nwith \u03bc < 0. Here there are two separatrices, each of which encloses periodic orbits\nsatisfying R 6= 0. The dynamical system can be rescaled so that R\u2032\u2032 = R \u2212 R3 .\n\n3\n\nMain Result\n\nThis section states the main theorem of this paper, which concerns the existence\nof quasiperiodic dynamics in a class of systems of the form (8), including the cases\nwith V (x) given by periodic lattices and superlattices. Applications to these cases\nare subsequently given in two subsections.\nThe equation of motion (8) describes a 1 21 degree of freedom Hamiltonian system whose forcing is periodic. We will allow arbitrary analytic periodic potential\nfunctions V . We first rescale the period of the forcing to 1. We introduce the phase\nvariable \u03be = T \u22121 x (mod 1), where T > 0 is the minimal period of V . Letting \u2032\ndenote differentiation with respect to \u03be, we define S = R\u2032 , and\n\u0010 m\u03bc m\n\u0011\nmg\nz2 (\u03be) = T 2\n\u2212 2 V (x) , z4 = \u2212T 2 2 , U(R, \u03be) = z2 (\u03be)R2 + z4 R4 .\n~\n~\n2~\nThis gives the suspended dynamical system\nR\u2032 = S ,\n\u2202U\nS\u2032 = \u2212\n(R, \u03be) ,\n\u2202R\n\u03be\u2032 = 1 ,\nwith Hamiltonian\n\n1\nH(R, S, \u03be) = S 2 + U(R, \u03be) .\n2\n9\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\n\fAuthors' note: We changed the following remark.\nRemark 4 : We restrict to analytic systems for convenience only. It is not a necessary restriction, as our result is based on Herman's translated curve theorem [27, 28],\nwhich requires only C 4 smoothness. Furthermore, finite-smoothness KAM results\ncan be obtained from analytic ones by inverse approximation [58]. The restriction\nto analytic systems allows one to use Cauchy's integral theorem to replace C k norms\nby C 0 ones.\nRemark 5 : Because z4 > 0, the function U is a well; that is, U \u2192 +\u221e as\nR \u2192 \u00b1\u221e for all \u03be. It is even in R, which has important ramifications for the sizes\nof the perturbations in our subsequent analysis. (See, for example, lemma 16 below,\nwhere the leading term in the nonintegrable parts F1 and F2 would have been order\none instead of going to zero as R \u2192 +\u221e were it not for this symmetry.)\nWe introduce action-angle coordinates as follows. (The details are in section\n4.) Let H0 (R, S) = 21 S 2 + z4 R4 . For h > 0, define the action I = I(h) to be\nthe area in the (R, S)-plane enclosed by the curve H0 (R, S) = h. Let the angle\n\u03c6 = \u03c6(R, S) \u2208 R/Z be such that the transformation (R, S) 7\u2192 (\u03c6, I) is symplectic.\nThis defines \u03c6 uniquely if we set \u03c6(0, S) \u2261 0 for S > 0.\nIn action-angle coordinates, the Hamiltonian takes the form K(\u03c6, I, \u03be) = K0 (I)+\nK1 (\u03c6, I, \u03be), where K0 (I) = H0 (R, S). We consider K as a perturbation of K0 . For\nany I0 > 0, the unperturbed system K0 has an invariant torus I = I0 with frequency\n\u03c9 = K0\u2032 (I0 ) in \u03c6. We say that this frequency is of constant type with parameter \u03b3 > 0\nif\np\np\n\u03c9\u2212\n\u2265 \u03b3q \u22122 for all\n\u2208 Q.\n(11)\nq\nq\nThis is a special type of Diophantine condition [27, 28].\nFor a function f defined on a set D, we define ||f ||D = supD |f |. If f is vectorvalued, then ||f ||D is the maximum of the norms of the components. For d > 0, let\nD\u0304(d) = {\u03be \u2208 C/Z : |Im(\u03be)| \u2264 2d}.\nWith the additional notation \u03b7 = 18\u03b3, M = z4 I0 , c = 126/25 = 5.04, and\nR1\nb1 = 0 (1 \u2212 u4 )1/2 du = 0.874019 . . ., the main result of this paper can now be\nstated as follows.\nTheorem 6 The Hamiltonian K has an invariant torus with frequency \u03c9 = K0\u2032 (I0 )\nin \u03c6 if there exist \u03bd, \u03b3, d > 0, and b2 > 0 with 0 \u2264 \u03bd \u2264 19 * 2\u22127/3 and 0 < \u03b3 \u2264 49\n72\n\n10\n\n\fsuch that \u03c9 is of constant type with parameter \u03b3 and the following conditions\n\u0013\n\u0012\n3 log B\n\u22124/3\n\u2264 2\u22124/3 b1 log(2) ,\nA 1+\nlog M\n1 < M,\n47\nL \u2264\n,\n200\nb2 \u2264 18[1 + 24b1 (\u03b7 + 2d)](1 + L)2/3 (1 \u2212 L)1/3 log(M) ,\n2 \u2264 BM 1/3 ,\nM 2/3\n||z2 ||D\u0304(d) \u2264 \u03b4 2\n,\nlog (M)\n\nhold:\n(12)\n(13)\n(14)\n(15)\n(16)\n(17)\n\nwhere\n2b2 d\n4/3\nL = 24/3 * 3b1 \u03b7M \u22121/3 +\n,\nlog(M)\n\u0013\n\u001a\n\u0012 2/3\n1 + 4(\u03b7 + 2d)\n7\u03bd\n2\u03b7 \u22121/3\n2\n\u22124/3\ndb1 b2 +\nA =\nmax\nM\nlog(M) +\n+\nd\n3\n9\n2\n\u001b\n\u22121/3\n3\u03bd \u22124/3\n2\n\u22124/3\n\u22125/3 2\n\u22121/3\nb\n(1 \u2212 L)\nL log(M), 2M\nlog(M) + db1 b2 ,\n27 1\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u22127/3\n1\n2\nM 1/3\n\u22124/3\n\u221213/3 3 8 \u22121 \u22124/3\n\u22126\nB = 2\n3 7 c db1 b2 \u03b7\n+\nb\nb2 2\n,\nlog(M)\n3 1\nlog (M)\n2\u22121/3\n\u22125/3\n\u03b4 =\n\u03bddb22 b1 (1 + L)\u22122/3 [1 + 24b1 (\u03b7 + 2d)]\u22123.\n3\nd + \u03c1).\nThe torus lies in the region given by |I \u2212 I0 | \u2264 b2 I0 [log(z4 I0 )]\u22121 ( 11\n19\nRemark 7 : Conditions (12) \u2013 (16) are satisfied for M sufficiently large, while\n(17) is a restriction on z2 and hence on V .

This fits with the numerically computed\n||z2 ||D\u0304(d) is roughly proportional to z4 Rmax\nphase portraits in figures 1 \u2013 3.\nIn terms of physical parameters, this implies that for an attractive BEC with\ngiven scattering length a < 0 and chemical potential \u03bc loaded into an arbitrary\nperiodic lattice of amplitude ||V || (with any number of wave numbers), the wave\nfunction's spatial component R(x) is quasiperiodic with two frequencies if its maximum Rmax is large enough, its frequencies satisfy the Diophantine condition (11),\nand the amplitude ||V\np|| of the lattice potential is sufficiently small. The lower bound\non Rmax scales as \u03ba/ |a|, where \u03ba = 2\u03c0/T is the lattice wave number (and we recall\nthat a is the two-body scattering length), whereas the upper bound on ||V || scales\n2\nas aRmax\n. All frequency ratios that are algebraic numbers of index 2 satisfy the\nDiophantine condition (for some \u03b3 > 0).\n11\n\n\fRemark 8 : The conditions of the theorem imply that M should be larger than\nroughly 106 . Indeed, from A \u2265 8 * 2M \u22121/3 log(M) and BM 1/3 \u2265 2, it follows\nthat A[1 + 3 log(B)/ log(M)] \u2265 48M \u22121/3 log(2). Hence condition (12) implies that\nM \u2265 216 33 b41 \u2248 106 .\nAs an illustration, we choose M and the parameters b2 , \u03b3, d, \u03bd based on a numerical experiment where we evaluate the conditions of the theorem on a Cartesian grid\nof 360 \u00d7 180 \u00d7 120 \u00d7 120 \u00d7 20 points in the cube [106 , 1018 ] \u00d7 [10\u22126 , 1] \u00d7 [10\u22123 , 10] \u00d7\n[10\u22123 , 10] \u00d7 [10\u22123 , 19 * 2\u22127/3 ] in (M, b2 , \u03b3, d, \u03bd) space, taking a logarithmic scale in the\nfirst four components and a linear scale in the last. For each M, we compute the\nlargest value of the coefficient \u03b4 over all grid points where all the conditions hold in\norder to obtain a good choice of parameter values. Figure 5 shows the largest \u03b4 one\ncan obtain for a range of M.\nlog10 (\u03b4)\n\n-4\n\n-6\n\n-8\n\n-10\n\n-12\n\n-14\n\n-16\n\n-18\n\n-20\n\n-22\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\nlog10 (M)\n\nFigure 5: Log-log plot of M against the largest value of \u03b4 found by a numerical\ncomputation.\nCorollary 9 If K has an invariant torus with frequency K0\u2032 (I0 ), then the return\nmap of K on the surface of section \u03be = 0 has an Aubry-Mather set with rotation\nnumber \u03c9 for any \u03c9 > K0\u2032 (I0 ).\nThe corollary follows immediately from Aubry-Mather theory [4, 40, 44] and the\nmonotonicity of K0\u2032 . Indeed, the Poincar\u00e9 map P0 corresponding to K0 is given by\nP0 : (\u03c6, I) 7\u2192 (\u03c6 + K0\u2032 (I), I) .\nFrom the monotonicity of K0\u2032 , it follows that this is a twist map. The proof of the\nmain result of Ref. [15] shows that the Poincar\u00e9 map P corresponding to K also\nsatisfies the twist condition. Alternatively, this also follows directly from the fact\nthat the function U is superquadratic.\n12\n\n\fAuthors' note: The paragraph that was here has been edited and changed\ninto the following remark.\nRemark 10 : The translated curve theorem used (in [15]) to prove theorem 6 shows\npersistence of invariant tori under relatively large perturbations (compared to other\nKAM or twist theorems), at the expense of excluding all but the \"most quasiperiodic\" frequencies \u03c9. If the Diophantine condition is relaxed to include a nonzero\nmeasure of frequencies, then one can similarly show that the region outside the innermost invariant torus contains a set of invariant tori of positive measure, where\nthe measure converges exponentially fast to full measure as I \u2192 +\u221e. The remaining dynamics in this region is presumably chaotic, but due to the low dimension of\nthe system, there can not be any Arnol'd diffusion. Thus, it is at worst bounded\nchaos. Among many papers on this subject, see e.g. [47, 58, 8] for further details.\nBy contrast, the region on the inside seems to exhibit chaotic dynamics, as can\nbe seen in figures 1 \u2013 3. In the near-autonomous setting (i.e., for small-amplitude\nV ), the figures show large domains of integrable dynamics in the interior region. A\nperturbation analysis for a similar system shows that, as the amplitude of V goes\nto infinity, the sizes of these islands vanish, but their number increases reciprocally,\nso that an integrable set of measure O(1) remains [48].\nIn the next two sections, we consider potentials V (x) with one and two wave\nnumbers. The former case describes BECs in periodic lattices [10, 12, 38, 52, 53],\nand the latter case, which is now experimentally accessible [51], describes BECs in\nperiodic superlattices [22, 36, 54].\n\n3.1\n\nExample 1: BECs in Periodic Lattices\n\nOptical lattice potentials are created experimentally as interference patterns of\ncounter-propagating laser beams [19]. In the periodic case, the external potential is\ntypically taken to be sinusoidal,\nV (x) = \u2212V1 cos(\u03bax) ,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere \u03ba = 2\u03c0/T is the lattice wave number.\nWe write equation (8) in the form\nR\u2032 = S ,\nS \u2032 = \u2212\u03b11 R + \u03b13 R3 + V1 R cos(\u03bax) ,\nx\u2032 = 1 ,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere \u03b11 \u221d \u03bc, \u03b13 \u221d g, and \u2032 denotes differentiation with respect to x. The parameters V1 , \u03b11 , \u03b13 \u2208 R and \u03ba > 0 can all be adjusted experimentally. The phase\nvariables are (R, S) \u2208 R2 and x \u2208 R/(2\u03c0\u03ba\u22121 Z). The associated Poincar\u00e9 map P ,\nwhich is defined to be the first return map on the section x = 0, corresponds to the\nflow over 2\u03c0\u03ba\u22121 .\n13\n\n\fEquation (19) has two reversible symmetries:\n(R, S, x) 7\u2192 (\u2212R, S, \u2212x) ,\n\n(R, S, x) 7\u2192 (R, \u2212S, \u2212x).\n\nThe map P is thus reversible under reflection in both coordinate axes,\nRj \u25e6 P \u25e6 Rj = P \u22121 ,\n\nj = 1, 2 ,\n\nwhere R1 and R2 are the reflections with respect to the axes.\nAdditionally, (19) is invariant under two rescalings:\n\u0001\n(R, S, x; \u03b11 , \u03b13 , \u03ba, V1 ) 7\u2192 R, \u03bbS, \u03bb\u22121 x; \u03bb2 \u03b11 , \u03bb2 \u03b13 , \u03bb\u03ba, \u03bb2 V1 ,\n\u0001\n(R, S, x; \u03b11 , \u03b13 , \u03ba, V1 ) 7\u2192 \u03bcR, \u03bcS, x; \u03b11 , \u03bc\u22122 \u03b13 , \u03ba, V1 .\n\n(20)\n(21)\n\nThe corresponding invariants for the Poincar\u00e9 map are obtained by dropping the x\ncomponents.\nOne can rescale (19) using these invariants to reduce to the cases where\n\u03b11 = 0 , \u00b11 and \u03b13 = 0 , \u00b11. We look in detail at the case \u03b11 = \u22121, \u03b13 = \u22121,\ncorresponding to an attractive BEC with a negative chemical potential, where the\nunderlying integrable system (with V1 = 0) is a \"figure eight\" (consisting of a central\nsaddle point and two exterior centers, as shown in figure 4c).\nBecause of the second rescaling (21), the parameter \u03b13 simply measures the\nsize of phase space. The first rescaling (20) shows that decreasing \u03ba increases the\nnonintegrable perturbation by a square law. Intuitively, a large lattice wave number\n\u03ba implies that the Poincar\u00e9 map corresponds to short-\"time\" integration in x and\nis thus \"near\" the vector field. With \u03ba rescaled to 1, as was done in stating and\nproving our main result, the perturbation V (x) in (19) has unit period.\nFigures 1 \u2013 3 show phase portraits of P at several amplitudes of the potential\nfor (\u03b11 , \u03b13 , \u03ba) = (\u22121, \u22121, 1). One obtains qualitatively similar results for other\nvalues of the lattice depth V1 if the wave number \u03ba is rescaled, as indicated above.\nAs remarked previously, the phase space in these phase portraits is divided into\ntwo clearly distinct regions: an outer one in which the dynamics consists in large\nmeasure of invariant circles and Cantor-like Aubry-Mather sets (that wind around\nthe origin at large distance) and an inner one in which the dynamics is mostly\nchaotic. Our numerical simulations, which show the same scaling that our theoretical\nresults indicate, suggest the presence of (parameter-dependent) integrable dynamics\nof positive but small measure inside the \"chaotic sea.\" [48]\nRemark 11 : A similar combination of islands of invariant tori within a chaotic\nsea occurs in the example of a parametrically forced planar pendulum [7]. The\ndivision of phase space into a mostly quasiperiodic and a mostly chaotic region is\nthe typical behavior that one expects to observe in a large class of forced one dof\nHamiltonian systems [15].\n\n14\n\n\fApplying theorem 6 for V (x) given by (18) implies that the system (19) has an\ninvariant torus with frequency vector (\u03c9, 1) provided \u03c9 satisfies the conditions of\ntheorem 6. The R-amplitude is roughly equal to Rmax , given by\n~\u03ba\u03c9\n,\nRmax = 3b1 \u221a\n\u03c0 \u2212mg\n\nwhere g < 0 for the present case of attractive BECs [see equation (24) and lemma\n13].\n\n3.2\n\nExample 2: BECs in Periodic Superlattices\n\nOptical superlattices consist of small-scale lattices subjected to a long-scale periodic\nmodulation. In recent experiments, BECs were created in superlattice potentials\nwith a length scale (wave number) ratio of 1:3 [51]. However, theoretical research\nconcerning BECs in superlattices has only begun to gain prevalence [22, 36, 54].\nTo consider the case of (symmetric) periodic superlattices, we examine the potential\nV (x) = \u2212 [V1 cos(\u03ba1 x) + V2 cos(\u03ba2 x)] ,\n(22)\nwhere \u03ba2 > \u03ba1 without loss of generality and \u03ba2 /\u03ba1 \u2208 Q. The minimal period is\nT = 2\u03c0/\u03ba, where \u03ba := gcd(\u03ba1 , \u03ba2 ).\nEquation (8) is then written\n\ndR\n=S,\ndx\ndS\n= \u2212\u03b11 R + \u03b13 R3 + V1 R cos(\u03ba1 x) + V2 R cos(\u03ba2 x) ,\ndx\ndx\n= 1,\n(23)\ndx\nwhere all the parameters are again experimentally adjustable.\nApplying theorem 6 for V (x) given by (22) with \u03ba2 /\u03ba1 \u2208 Q (i.e., for periodic\nsuperlattices) implies that (23) has an invariant torus with frequency vector (\u03c9, 1)\nprovided \u03c9 satisfies the conditions of theorem 6. As in the regular lattice case, the\nR-amplitude is roughly equal to Rmax , where\n~\u03ba\u03c9\n,\nRmax = 3b1 \u221a\n\u03c0 \u2212mg\n\nand we recall that 2\u03c0/\u03ba is the period of V (x) and g < 0 for attractive BECs.\nRemark 12 : If \u03ba2 /\u03ba1 is not rational, then the potential V is not periodic. If\n\u03ba1 and \u03ba2 satisfy a Diophantine condition, then one can prove the existence of\ninvariant tori at large distance from the origin [32]. We conjecture that it is possible\nto quantify this existence result analogous to the periodic case [15]. If \u03ba1 and \u03ba2\nare not Diophantine-for example, if \u03ba2 /\u03ba1 is a Liouville number-then one expects\nunbounded solutions and no invariant tori [29].\n15\n\n\f4\n\nProof of the main result\n\nTo prove Theorem 6, we first construct action-angle coordinates explicitly. We then\nemploy the KAM theorem of Chow, et al. [15] to complete the proof after a suitable\ntransformation of the action variable.\n\n4.1\n\nThe action and K0\n\nDefine the action by\nI(h) =\n\nZ\n\nRmax\n\nZ\n\nS dR = 4\n\n0\n\nH0 =h\n\np\n2h \u2212 2z4 R4 dR ,\n\nwhere H0 (R, S) = 12 S 2 + z4 R4 and Rmax = Rmax (h) > 0 is the solution of\n\u22121/4\nH0 (Rmax , 0) = h; that is, Rmax = z4 h1/4 . With the substitution u = R/Rmax\n4\nand the relation h = z4 Rmax\n, the above integral reduces to\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1/2 3\n\u22121/4\nI(h) = 4 2b1 z4 Rmax\n= 4 2b1 z4 h3/4 .\n(24)\nLemma 13 The unperturbed Hamiltonian in action-angle coordinates is given by\n\u22124/3 1/3 4/3\nz4 I .\n\nK0 (I) = 2\u221210/3 b1\n\nThe proof follows from the calculation above, noting that the unperturbed\nHamiltonian K0 is the inverse of the function I [because H0 (R, S) = K0 (I) for\nI = I(H0 (R, S))]. The function I is invertible because\n\u221a\n\u2202I\n\u22121/4\n= 3 2b1 z4 h\u22121/4 > 0.\n\u2202h\nRemark 14 : One could also define the action to be the area enclosed by the\ncurve 12 S 2 + z\u03042 R2 + z4 R4 = h, where z\u03042 is the average of z2 , or even the area enclosed\nby H = h, where \u03be is considered as a parameter (that is, \u03be \u2032 = 0 in the unperturbed\nsystem). In the latter case, the action and angle will depend on \u03be. Although\nthese two approaches each leave a smaller term in the perturbation than our choice,\nand are therefore theoretically more pleasing, they lead to technical difficulties in\nthe estimates we need to perform, as the expressions for the action and angle will\ninvolve elliptic integrals that depend on the phase variables.\n\n4.2\n\nThe angle\n\nIn the upper half plane (S \u2265 0), we define the angle by\n\u03c6(h, R) =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202I\n\u2202h\n\n\u0013\u22121 Z\n\nR\n0\n\n1\ndw (mod 1) ,\nS\u0304(h, w)\n\n16\n\n\f\u221a\nwhere S\u0304(h,HR) = 2h \u2212 2z4 R4 is the positive solution of H0 (R, S\u0304(h, R)) = h. Note\n\u2202I\nthat \u2202h\n= H0 =h S \u22121 dR. A similar definition holds in the lower half plane, where\nR\n\u2202I \u22121 R \u22121\n)\nS\u0304 dw (mod 1).

This takes the unperturbed torus I = I0 to J = 0 and rescales the\naction variable, so that the components f1 , f2 of the perturbation are roughly the\nsame size after rescaling and some other conditions are met (see remark 21 below).\nAlthough it is not a symplectic transformation, it nonetheless maps Hamiltonian\nsystems to Hamiltonian systems.\nDefine \u03c9 = K0\u2032 (I0 ) and m = \u03b2(I0 )K0\u2032\u2032 (I0 ), so that\n1 \u22124/3 \u22124/3 1/3 1/3\n*2\nb1 z4 I0 ,\n3\n1/3 1/3\n1 \u22124/3 \u22124/3 z4 I0\n*2\nb1 b2\n.\nm =\n9\nlog (z4 I0 )\n\u03c9 =\n\n(25)\n(26)\n\nLemma 16 In (\u03c6, J, \u03be) coordinates, the system is written\n\u03c6\u2032 = \u03c9 + mJ + g(J) + F1 (\u03c6, J, \u03be) , J \u2032 = F2 (\u03c6, J, \u03be) , \u03be \u2032 = 1,\nwhere, for some J\u2217 , J \u2217 \u2208 (0, J),\n\n1\n\u03b2(I0 )2 K0\u2032\u2032\u2032 (I0 + \u03b2(I0 )J\u2217 )J 2\n2\n\u0013\u22125/3 \u0012\n\u00132\n\u0012\nb2 J\nb2 J\u2217\n1\n\u22124/3 \u22124/3 1/3 1/3\n= \u2212 *2\nb1 z4 I0\n1+\n,\n27\nlog (z4 I0 )\nlog (z4 I0 )\n\ng(J) =\n\n\u2202g\n(J) = \u03b2(I0 )2 K0\u2032\u2032\u2032 (I0 + \u03b2(I0 )J \u2217 )J\n\u2202J\n\u0013\u22125/3\n1/3 1/3 \u0012\nb2 J \u2217\nb2 J\n1\nz4 I0\n\u22121/3 \u22124/3\n1+\nb1 b2\n,\n= \u2212 *2\n27\nlog (z4 I0 )\nlog (z4 I0 )\nlog (z4 I0 )\nF1 (\u03c6, J, \u03be) = f1 (\u03c6, I0 + \u03b2(I0 )J, \u03be)\n\u0013\u22121/3\n\u0012\n1 \u22122/3 \u22122/3\nb2 J\n2 \u22121/3 \u22121/3\n=\n*2\nb1 z2 (\u03be)r z4 I0\n1+\n,\n3\nlog (z4 I0 )\nF2 (\u03c6, J, \u03be) = \u03b2(I0 )\u22121 f2 (\u03c6, I0 + \u03b2(I0 )J, \u03be)\n\u00132/3\n\u0012\nb2 J\n1/3 1/3\n4 1/2 \u22121 log (z4 I0 )\n.\n1+\n= \u22123 * 2 b1 z2 (\u03be)r(1 \u2212 r ) b2\n1/3 1/3\nlog (z4 I0 )\nz4 I0\n\u22121/3\n\nThe lemma shows that the nonintegrable parts F1 and F2 are order I0\nin\nleading term; this would have been order 1 had the original function U included a\ncubic term.\nProof: Write \u03a9(J) = K0\u2032 (I0 + \u03b2(I0 )J), so that \u03c9 = \u03a9(0) and m = \u03a9\u2032 (0).

Let \u03b5 be the smallest number such that r = r(\u03c6) \u2208 E = E(\u03b5) for all \u03c6 \u2208 D\u0304.\nHence, there exists \u03c60 \u2208 D\u0304 such that r(\u03c60 ) is on the boundary of E.

Analyzing\nthe dependence on z4 then leads to the chosen rescaling.\n\n5\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nIn this paper, we discussed quasiperiodic dynamics in Bose-Einstein condensates\n(BECs) in periodic lattices and superlattices. The mean-field dynamics of a BEC\nis governed by the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation (1), which consists of a cubic\nnonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation plus an external potential that takes into account\nthe \"trap\" where the condensate resides. In this mean-field description, a given\nparticle in the BEC is affected by the other particles only through average effects,\nand the non-local term in the original many-body Hamiltonian leads to the nonlinear\nterm in the GP equation. One obtains a cubic nonlinearity if considering only\ntwo-body interactions. The GP equation, which is derived as a zero-temperature\ntheory, provides a good description for BEC dynamics below the critical transition\ntemperature at which the condensate forms [17, 33]. In \"cigar-shaped\" BECs, two\ndimensions are tightly confined, so one may further reduce (1) to (2), which has\none spatial dimension [17]. The amplitude dynamics of coherent structures of (2)\nwith trivial phase (which describe standing waves) are governed by a forced Duffing\nequation given by (8), or equivalently by (9). The first equation arises directly from\nthe physical setting, whereas (9) is the more convenient decription for mathematical\nanalysis. We briefly describe the dynamics of this system.\nIn the absence of the forcing (i.e., when the external potential V \u2261 0), the\nsystem reduces to the autonomous Duffing oscillator and is integrable. Its dynamics\ndepends on the sign of the chemical potential \u03bc (which indicates how many particles\n22\n\n\fare trapped in the BEC) and is illustrated in figure 4. Here, we considered the\ntwo situations with negative chemical potential (figure 4b,c). In both cases, there\nis a family of invariant tori winding around the trivial periodic orbit R \u2261 0. When\nviewed in the proper coordinates, the dynamics on each torus is a flow with constant\nvelocity vector. One frequency is equal to 1, and the other varies from one torus to\nthe next, going to infinity monotonically as the distance of the torus to R \u2261 0 goes\nto infinity. The \"proper coordinates\" are the action-angle coordinates introduced\nin section 4. These tori correspond to quasiperiodic oscillations of R(x), which\ndescribes the amplitude dynamics of the BEC wave function. We note that in this\nunforced setting, the quasiperiodicity has no physical meaning, as the period of the\noptical lattice potential does not yet play a role.\nIn the forced setting, V 6= 0. Figures 1 \u2013 3 illustrate the case of a periodic lattice\nfor a range of amplitudes. We remark that from a mathematical point of view, there\nis no extra difficulty in dealing with superlattices or even lattices with more than\ntwo Fourier modes as compared to lattices with just a single mode, provided the\nperiods are commensurate (that is, provided they have a common multiple). Our\nmain result, Theorem 6, uses KAM theory to demonstrate that for any size of the\nperiodic forcing, there exist invariant tori winding around the trivial periodic orbit.\nLet Rmax denote the maximal R coordinate on an invariant torus. That is, Rmax\nis the amplitude of the corresponding oscillations. In terms of the mathematical\nsetting (9), invariant tori exist for a dense set of \"admissible\" Rmax in the interval\n\u22121/2\n(cz4 ||z2 ||1/2 , +\u221e), for some positive constant c > 0. In terms of the physical\n\u221a\nparameters, the lowest admissible amplitude is roughly equal to 3b1 ~\u03ba\u03c9/(\u03c0 \u2212mg),\nwhere \u03c9 is its frequency, \u03ba is the lattice wave number, b1 \u2248 0.874019 is a constant,\nm is the mass of the atomic species in the condensate, and g < 0 is the scaled value\nof the two-body scattering length. The parameter g varies from one condensate\nspecies to another and can be changed by exploiting Feshbach resonances [21].\nAuthors' note: The following paragraph has been edited.\nThe set of admissible Rmax is characterized by a Diophantine condition on the\nfrequencies of the torus. A slightly different KAM theorem than the one used in this\nwork shows that, for each forcing, the relative measure of invariant tori converges\nto full measure as Rmax \u2192 +\u221e. See, for example, [47, 58] for a general statement\nor [8] for discussion of a system similar to ours. Thus, we find a large measure of\nquasiperiodic dynamics, and in the complement of the union of invariant tori, there\nexist Aubry-Mather sets. Furthermore, by the Poincar\u00e9-Birkhoff Theorem [5, 6],\nin between any two invariant tori there are periodic orbits of saddle and center\ntype for all intermediate resonant frequencies (technically, these can be classified as\nAubry-Mather sets as well). As a result, there is a large measure of quasiperiodic\ninvariant tori interlaced with Aubry-Mather sets and resonant layers. We further\nnote that the homoclinic figure eight that exists in the unforced setting for \u03bc < 0\nwill generically break under the forcing, generating a homoclinic tangle, as can be\nchecked for this specific case by computing Melnikov integrals. We refer to [25, 64]\nfor such computations on similar systems. A possible direction for future study\n23\n\n\fwould be to establish conditions for the nonexistence of invariant tori in the system\nunder consideration, which would complement the existence conditions presented in\nthis paper. Such a converse KAM theorem was obtained in [41] for area-preserving\ntwist maps and in [39] in a Lagrangian/Hamiltonian setting.\nFrom a physical perspective, we recall that the GP equation is derived from\na many-body quantum problem under the assumption that the Bose gas is dilute\n[17, 33]. In particular, this implies that the mean interparticle distance should be\nmuch larger than the scattering length. Therefore, the large R results obtained\nhere would necessitate the condensate to have expanded sufficiently to ensure that\nits density is low (so that the reduction from the many-body problem to the threedimensional GP description remains valid). Accordingly, for sufficiently large R, one\nwould eventually have to include corrections to the GP equation arising beyond the\nmean-field description to describe the physics correctly. Incorporating beyond-meanfield dynamics in the study of BECs is a difficult problem (see, e.g., the discussion\nin Ref. [59]), and it is not agreed precisely when such corrections become relevant\nor what form they should take to simultaneously ensure tractability and correctly\ncapture the physics.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to Peter Engels, Panos Kevrekidis, Boris Malomed, Alexandru\nNicolin, and Li You for useful discussions concerning this research.
