The final merger\nstage of a binary in which the black holes have comparable masses will produce a spectacular burst of gravitational radiation and is expected to be one of the brightest sources in the gravitational wave sky. Mergers of\nbinaries containing two stellar black holes are important\ntargets for the first-generation LIGO gravitational wave\ndetectors, now operating at design sensitivity in a yearlong science data-taking run, as well as other groundbased detectors such as VIRGO and GEO. Knowledge\nof the waveforms from the final merger phase is important to improve the detectability of these sources by such\ndetectors[1, 2]. Mergers of massive black hole binaries are\nimportant sources for the space-based LISA, currently in\nthe formulation phase. Since LISA is expected to observe these massive black hole mergers at relatively high\nsignal-to-noise ratios [3], comparison of the data with calculated merger waveforms should allow a test of General\nRelativity in the dynamical, nonlinear regime.\nIn the early stages of the binary inspiral, the black\nholes are widely separated and the waveforms can be calculated analytically using perturbative methods. However, waveforms from the final merger, in which the black\nholes plunge together and form a single, highly-distorted\nblack hole with a common horizon, demand full 3-D numerical relativity simulations of the full Einstein equations. This proved be a very difficult undertaking and,\nfor roughly the past decade, 3-D numerical relativity simulations have been beset by pernicious numerical instabililties that prevented the simulation codes from running\nlong enough to evolve any significant fraction of a binary\norbit.\nRecently, however, dramatic progress has been made\nin evolving the merger of equal mass binary black holes.\nUsing excision to remove the singular regions within the\n\nhorizons and a corotating coordinate system to keep the\nblack holes fixed in the numerical grid, a binary has been\nevolved through a little more than an orbit, and through\nmerger [4, 5, 6], though without being able to extract\ngravitational waves. Simulations of excised black holes\nallowed to move through the grid on one or more orbits\nand then through merger have been carried out, with\nthe extraction of gravitational radiation [7]. In addition,\nnew techniques allowing the black holes to move without\nthe need for excision have been developed independently\nby the authors of this paper and another research group\n[8, 9]; these have been applied to study the final plunge,\nand merger of a binary, with the calculation of gravitational waves. Recently, these techniques have been applied to evolve a binary with nonequal masses [10] and\nthe last orbit and merger of an equal mass binary [11].\nIt is especially noteworthy that this progress is occurring\non a broad front, by several independent groups using\ndifferent techniques.\nSeveral major open questions in the area of binary\nblack hole mergers center on the dependence of the resulting gravitational waveforms on the initial data. In\norder to use numerical relativity simulations to compare\nwith data from gravitational wave detectors, we need to\nmodel astrophysically realistic binary black hole configurations. For non-spinning equal mass black holes, how\nstrongly do the gravitational waveforms for the merger\ndepend on the initial data? What are the effects of spin\nand non-equal masses on the resulting waveforms? The\nanswers to such questions can only be approached using\nan evolutionary analysis, in which different initial data\nsets are evolved and the resulting waveforms are compared.\nIn this paper, we take a step towards answering these\nquestions by evolving several initial data sets for nonspinning equal mass black holes through the final few orbits, plunge, merger and ringdown. To accomplish this,\nwe apply our new methods that allow puncture black\n\n\f2\nholes to move freely across a grid. Using adaptive mesh\nrefinement, we can resolve the dynamical regions near\nthe black holes (having length scales \u223c M , where M is\nthe total mass of the system and we use c = G = 1)\nand the outer regions where the gravitational waves are\nextracted (having length scales \u223c (10 \u2212 100)M ). Putting\nthe outer boundary typically at t \u2248 768M , causally\ndisconnected from the dynamical regions and wavezone\nthroughout most of the simulation, we can evolve stably\nfor t > 800M . The initial data sets are chosen to be\npuncture data [12].\nOur study focuses on simulations beginning from a set\nof four inspiralling black hole configurations modelled as\ndescribed in Sec. II and using techniques discussed in\nSec. III. In Sec. IV we calibrate the performance of our\nnumerical techniques with a resolution study of simulations from the configuration with the shortest initial\nseparation. Our main results are presented in Sec. V\nwhere we comparatively study the radiation waveforms\nand black hole trajectories. We find a close relationship\nbetween the trajectory information and the waveforms,\nproviding a consistent picture of the black hole dynamics.\nThe radiation from the final orbit, merger and ringdown\nagrees to high precision among the runs from our range\nof initial configurations, with the runs from the farthest\ninitial separation producing a promising waveform approximately through the last three orbits\n\nII.\n\nINITIAL DATA\n\nWe start by setting up initial data for equal mass binary black holes represented as \"punctures\" [12]. The\nmetric on the initial spacelike slice is written in the form\ngij = \u03c8 4 \u03b4ij , where i, j = 1, 2, 3, with conformal factor\n\u03c8 = \u03c8BL + u. The static, singular P\npart of the confor2\nmal factor takes the form \u03c8BL = 1 + n=1 mn /2|~r \u2212 ~rn |,\nth\nwhere the n black hole has mass mn and is located at\ncoordinate position ~rn . The nonsingular function u is calculated by solving the Hamiltonian constraint equation\nusing AMRMG [13].\nThe punctures are initially placed on the y\u2212axis in the\nequatorial (z = 0) plane. We need to specify the individual puncture mass m, coordinate position Y , and momentum P so that the black holes are on approximately\ncircular orbits and have no individual spins (they are irrotational). To accomplish this, we adapt the quasicircular initial data from the QC sequence given in Ref. [14].\nThese data are based in turn on the results of Cook ([15];\nsee also [16]), who uses an effective potential method that\nminimizes the binary system energy while holding the\norbital angular momentum fixed, to produce an approximately circular orbit.\nThe parameters and physical quantities for the simulations we ran are shown in Table I. Here, Y is the initial\ncoordinate position of each puncture along the y\u2212axis, P\nis the linear momentum of an individual puncture, and\nm is the mass of the puncture. M0 is the initial total\n\nADM mass of the binary and J0 is the initial total angular momentum. L is the initial proper separation of the\nRH \u221a\nblack holes, approximated by L = H12 gyy dy, where\neach limit Hi represents a point on the Schwarzschild\nhorizon associated with mass mi at position ~ri .\nRun\nR1\nR2\nR3\nR4\n\n\u00b1Y\n3.257\n3.776\n4.251\n4.77\n\n\u00b1P\n0.133\n0.119\n0.109\n0.101\n\nm\n0.483\n0.488\n0.49\n0.492\n\nM0\n0.996\n1.001\n1.002\n1.003\n\nJ0 L/M0\n0.868 9.9\n0.899 11.1\n0.928 12.1\n0.959 13.2\n\nTABLE I: Initial data parameters and physical quantities for\nthe runs considered in this paper.\n\nWe note that our runs R1, R2, R3, and R4 correspond\nclosely to the initial data for models QC-6, QC-7, QC8, and QC-9, respectively, along the QC sequence. As\nshown in Ref. [14], at these relatively wide initial separations, the parameters for these initial data sets are close\nto those derived using post-Newtonian (PN) techniques;\nsee in particular Figs. 26 - 28 in Ref. [14].\nIII.\n\nSIMULATION TECHNIQUES\n\nWe evolve the initial data with the Hahndol code[17],\nwhich uses a conformal (BSSN) formulation of Einstein's\nevolution equations on a cell-centered numerical grid.\nThe basic equations are the same as given in Ref. [17],\nwith the exception that the evolution equation for the\nBSSN variable \u0393\u0303i has been modified for stability as suggested in [18]. In addition, to reduce high frequency noise\nassociated with refinement interfaces, we add some dissipation of the form given in [19].\nMesh refinement and parallelization are implemented\nin our code with the PARAMESH package [20, 21]. We\nuse 4th -order centered differencing for the spatial derivatives except for the advection of the shift, which is performed with 4th -order upwinded differencing. The refinement boundary interfaces are buffered with 4th -orderinterpolated guard cells which, at worst, may introduce\n2nd -order errors into second derivatives. With our current mesh refinement implementation, our accuracy is\nlimited by spatial finite differencing error from refinement interfaces. Since we do not gain much by using\nhigher order time integration, we use 2nd -order time stepping via a three-step iterative Crank-Nicholson scheme.\nEven though, overall, we expect 2nd -order convergence,\nwe have found considerable advantage in using 4th -order\nspatial differencing over 2nd -order spatial differencing, as\nmeasured by the accuracy and manifest convergence of\nthe Hamiltonian constraint and other quantities.\nTraditionally, puncture black holes have been evolved\nby keeping them fixed in the grid [4, 5]. This is accomplished by factoring out the singular part \u03c8BL and handling it analytically, while evolving only the regular parts\n\n\f3\nof the metric. As explained in detail in [8], we employ instead newly developed techniques that allow the puncture\nblack holes to move freely across the numerical grid. The\nsingular part is not factored out; instead the entire conformal factor is evolved. Initially, the binary is set up so\nthat the centers of the punctures are not located at grid\npoints (as in the traditional implementation). Taking\nnumerical derivatives of \u03c8BL causes an effective regularization of the puncture singularity through the inherent\nsmoothing of finite differences.\nOur new approach allows the punctures to move freely\nby implementing a modified version of the Gammafreezing shift vector. The Gamma-freezing condition generally improves numerical stability by evolving the coordinates towards quiescence, in accord with the physical\ndynamics. Our modification to this gauge is tailored for\nmoving punctures, as mentioned in [8]. Specifically we\nuse\n\u2202t \u03b2 i =\n\n3\n\u03b1B i\n4\n\n(1)\n\nand\n\u2202t B i = \u2202t \u0393\u0303i \u2212 \u03b2 j \u2202j \u0393\u0303i \u2212 \u03b7B i\n\nis fixed in place throughout all runs.1 Boxes inside this\none can, and generally do, change adaptively as the simulation evolves; boxes outside this one maintain their original locations on the grid. At the initial time, there is a\nbox stretching out to 24M ; as the binary evolves, this\nbox generally shrinks as the black holes spiral in towards\nthe center. The resolution in the region between this\nbox and the next (fixed) one at \u00b148M is hw = 32hf in\nall runs. We generally extract gravitational waves on a\nsphere of radius rex = 30M . In the early stages of the\nrun, this sphere intersects the next innermost box with\nresolution hw /2; at later times, it is completely located\nwithin the region having resolution hw .\nWe extract gravitational waves from our simulations\nusing the Weyl tensor component \u03a84 . Our wave extraction techniques are based on Misner's method [22] and are\n2nd \u2212 order accurate. They are robust and accurate even\nwhen the extraction radii cross mesh refinement boundaries [23]. In particular, the waveforms computed at various extraction radii rex are preserved up to the leading\norder 1/r scaling and show no ill effects from passing\nthrough one or more refinement boundaries.\n\n(2)\n\nfor the shift \u03b2 i and\n\u2202t \u03b1 = \u22122\u03b1K + \u03b2 i \u2202i \u03b1\n\nIV.\n\n(3)\n\nfor the lapse \u03b1. The lapse equation (3) is the well-known\n\"1+log\" slicing condition, modified with an advection\nterm as in [9]. We use the initial gauge conditions \u03b2 = 0,\nB = 0, and \u03b1 = \u03c8 \u22122 , similar to those recommended\nin [9]. We place the punctures in the z = 0 plane and\nimpose equatorial symmetry throughout.\nWe use adaptive mesh refinement to produce a numerical grid having appropriate resolution in the strong-field\ndynamical regions near the black holes and in the wave\nzone. Initially, we set up the black hole binary in a numerical domain with a box-in-box refinement structure\nhaving an innermost refinement of hf and subsequent\nboxes of twice that resolution. We start with two boxes\ncentered on each individual black hole, and then a box\ncentered on the origin that encompasses both black holes.\nSubsequent boxes centered on the origin are used to give\nup to a total of 10 refinement levels.\nDuring the evolution the black holes move freely across\nthe grid, changing the curvature in the surrounding region; in response, the initial grid structure is changed\nadaptively. Paramesh works on logically Cartesian, or\nstructured, grids and carries out the mesh refinement on\ngrid blocks. If the curvature reaches a certain threshold\n(a free parameter in our code) at one point of a block,\nthat block is bisected in each coordinate direction to produce 8 child blocks, each having half the resolution of the\nparent block. If all points in all the child blocks fall below\nthe threshold, those blocks get derefined.\nThe box stretching from \u221248M to +48M in the x\u2212\nand y\u2212directions and from 0 to +48M in the z\u2212direction\n\nCALIBRATION OF SIMULATIONS\n\nWe have performed detailed studies of the errors\nand convergence behavior of simulations run on the\nHahndol code using fixed mesh refinement in previous\nwork [8, 17, 23, 24]. The simulations presented here differ from this earlier work in two important ways: they\nare carried out using an adaptive mesh structure that\nchanges as the binaries evolve, and they are run for significantly longer durations. In this section, we discuss\nthe calibration tests we have carried out to verify that\nthe code produces robust, reliable results in these more\nchallenging regimes.\nWe performed these calibration tests on run R1, which\nwe ran at three different resolutions. The initial data\nparameters for R1 are given in Table I and the simulation\nparameters for these three cases are shown in Table II.\nWe use a base resolution of \u03c1 = 3M/32 = 0.09375M from\nwhich we reach the three resolutions used in the runs.\nNote that the medium resolution case, hf = \u03c1/3, has the\nR1 cases\nlow\nhf\n\u03c1/2\nouter boundary \u00b1768M\n186M\nTsim\n\n1\n\nmedium\nhigh\n\u03c1/3\n\u03c1/4\n\u00b1192M \u00b1768M\n332M\n291M\n\nFor convenience, we use M = 1 to set the scale for the computational grid and time.

Since the simulation\nruns for a total duration Tsim = 332M , small errors from\nthis outer boundary do have time to propagate in to the\nphysically interesting regions of the grid. While these\neffects are generally small and have no significant impact\non the dynamics or wave extraction, we did use a more\ndistant outer boundary at \u00b1768M in all other runs to\neliminate this problem. This adds only a small overhead\nto the overall cost of the simulation, due to the fixed\nmesh refinement structure used in the outer regions.\nFor these three runs, we scaled the criterion for refinement and derefinement to provide as closely as possible\nthe same grid structure at the same physical time in the\nsimulations. Since it is generally not possible to match\nthe grid structures exactly, pointwise convergence tests\nare of questionable value. Instead, we calculated the L1\nnorm of the Hamiltonian constraint CH over the grid as\na function of time. This norm was taken over all levels\ninside the box at \u00b148M , which includes the wave extraction zone. Figure 1 shows the L1 norms for these three\nruns; note that the initial growth of the constraint violation is brought to a halt after approximately 50M of\nevolution and then diminishes. We attribute this behavior in CH to a gauge wave pulse that we have observed\nleaving the source region early in the simulation. The\ngauge wave has strong high frequency components and is\nthus prone to generating differencing error and reflections\nfrom refinement boundaries. CH settles down somewhat\nafter the gauge wave leaves the grid, as suggested by the\nplot. The curves are scaled so that, for 2nd \u2212order convergence, they would lie on top of each other. As Fig. 1\nshows, we get 2nd \u2212order convergence (or slightly better)\nfor the entire course of the run.\nThe gravitational waves are extracted on a sphere of\nradius rex = 30M . The top panel of Fig. 2 shows the\nl = 2, m = 2 component of r\u03a84 for the three different resolution runs, where r is the estimated areal radius of the extraction sphere [23]. The waves start out\nin phase; note in particular the agreement in the initial\npulse around t \u223c 30M . However, as the runs proceed,\ntiming differences slowly accumulate over the relatively\nlong orbital time scales. By t \u223c 150M , significant differences have accumulated in the lowest resolution case\n(solid line) compared to the other two runs; we attribute\nthis to the larger inherent numerical diffusion in this lowest resolution run.\nA naive convergence test, in which we take differences\ndirectly between the waveforms at the same simulation\ntimes, is shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 2; these curves\nare scaled so that, for 2nd \u2212order convergence they would\ncoincide. Comparing the top and bottom panels, it is\nclear that the differences between these curves can mainly\nbe attributed to the differences in the phases of the wave-\n\n1.5\n\n0\n\n-0.01\n\n\u03a8(med)-\u03a8(high)\n\u03a8(low) -\u03a8(med)*(7/20)\n\n-0.02\n-0.03\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nt/M\n\nFIG. 2: Gravitational waveforms and a naive convergence\ntest.

At several times, the phases are actually off by \u03c0\nso that the differences between the two waves is twice as\nlarge as the individual waves themselves.\nA more meaningful convergence test is shown in Fig. 3.\nHere, we have shifted the waveforms in time and phase\nto adjust for the timing differences using the techniques\ndescribed below.

We\ncalculate dE/dt and dJ/dt from time integrals of all l = 2\nand l = 3 waveform components using Eqs. (5.1) and\n(5.2) in [14]. Integrating dE/dt gives the total energy\nloss due to the radiation, Erad . We find that the influ-\n\nence of higher modes of the waves contribute < 1% to\nthe energy and even less to the angular momentum.\nThe total radiated energies calculated from the waveforms extracted at different radii and with different resolutions are reported in Table III. For lower resolution, the\nradiated energy depends somewhat on the extraction radius, decreasing with increasing radius. For the medium\nand high resolution cases, however, the values are almost\nindependent of the extraction radius. This indicates that\nthe further out, lesser refined regions of the grid produce\nsignificant dissipation of the waves in the low resolution\ncase, whereas when the resolution is high enough, the\nlesser refined regions do not have such an effect. These\nconsiderations indicate that the best radius to extract\nthe energy is at rex = 30M , in a region refined enough\nthat the energy does not significantly dissipate in the low\nresolution run, yet far enough way from the source that\nit changes only minimally for higher resolution runs.\nAs shown in Table III, the radiated angular momentum\nJrad varies by a few percent between rex = 30M and\nrex = 50M at high resolution. This observation seems\nto agree with the notion that the angular momentum\ndepends more strongly on the longer wavelength parts\nof the waves [14], which should be extracted at greater\ndistances. For all the runs reported in this paper, we use\nan extraction radius of rex = 50M to calculate Jrad .\n\nV.\n\nRESULTS\n\nIn this section we comparatively analyze the results\nof simulations based on our R1-R4 black hole configurations. Recall that the initial data for each of these simulations starts the black holes at different separations,\nwith proper separations varying from 9.9M0 to 13.2M0,\nand provided with sufficient angular momentum that the\nruns are estimated to be on initially circular orbits.\nWe can think of each of these simulations as an approximate representation of the late-time portion of an ideal\nspacetime which begins with arbitrarily well-separated\nblack holes on an inspiraling trajectory which asymptotically approaches circular orbits. As such representations,\nthere are several limitations which the initial data models may have. In particular, the initial parameters will\nonly approximate the ideal trajectory since the angular\nmomentum as a function of radius may differ from the\nvalue required for an idealized circular orbit. Likewise,\nat finite radius, the ideal spiral trajectory can only be\napproximated by our initially circular configurations.\nFurthermore the manner by which we have mapped\nfrom these trajectory specifications to actual initial data\nvalues necessarily requires making some suppositions.\nFor instance, our puncture data prescription, like almost\nall field prescriptions, contains no representation of prior\nradiation generated before the time at which the initial\ndata are posed. Though it is generally expected that\nthe significance of such limitations on the final merger\nsimulations should be reduced if the black holes begin\n\n\f6\n\nR1\nR2\nR3\nR4\nMerger\n\n4\n\n2\n\ny/M\n\nsufficiently far apart, there is no clear way to assess just\nhow significant such effects will be on the results, including the gravitational waveforms, before carrying out the\nevolutions.\nOur simulations, begun with varying initial separations, should be affected by any initial modeling error\nin varying amounts, but should agree to the degree that\nthey represent the ideal astrophysical spacetime. A key\nobjective in our analysis is to identify universal characteristics among the different runs which, we reason,\nare then likely to correctly represent those aspects of the\nastrophysical equal-mass non-spinning binary black hole\nmerger spacetime.\n\n0\n\n-2\n\nA.\n\nOverview of Simulations\n\nOur comparative analysis covers four simulations labeled R1 to R4 in Table I. We evolved them all using the\nmedium resolution of hf = \u03c1/3 except for R1, where we\nhave applied the higher hf = \u03c1/4 resolution. In all runs\nwe used an initial grid setup and adaptive mesh refinement as described in Sec. III. We evolved all the runs\nto well after the wave signal had passed the extraction\nregion; the actual amount of time is noted as Tsim in\nTable IV. For the time-slicing condition used in our simulations, the region where the lapse satisfies the condition\n\u03b1 = 0.3 corresponds roughly with the apparent horizon\nlocation. We thus used the moment when the two \u03b1 = 0.3\nregions around the black holes merge to specify a merger\ntime Tmerge . The number of orbits for each run, Norbits ,\nwas estimated from the trajectories shown in Fig. 4 and\nis taken up to the point at which the merger occurs.\n\nL/M0\nhf\nTsim\nTmerger\nNorbits\n\nR1\nR2\nR3\nR4\n9.9\n11.1 12.1 13.2\n\u03c1/4\n\u03c1/3\n\u03c1/3\n\u03c1/3\n421M 531M 530M 850M\n160M 234M 396M 513M\n1.8\n2.5\n3.6\n4.2\n\nTABLE IV: Simulation parameters and general results.\nTmerger is the time at which the merger occurs, starting from\nthe initial time in each run.\n\nA graphical overview of our four simulations is presented in Fig. 4 showing the paths traced by the black\nhole punctures on the computational domain.

For clarity, we show only the track of one of the\nblack holes from each simulation.

The point of merger (estimated\nby a single connected isosurface of \u03b1 = 0.3) is indicated by as\nan asterisk in the plot.\n\nwhich occurs very near the end of the puncture trajectory. R4 has the widest initial separation and completes\nthe largest number of orbits. Each of the other cases,\nafter an initial transient period of approximately one orbit, nearly locks on to the R4 trajectory. For the final\norbit, all four trajectories are very nearly superposed. In\nSec. V C we study the quantiative features of these trajectories in more detail.\nFig. 5 shows one polarization component of r\u03a84 for\nthe runs R1 - R4, extracted at rex = 30M and shifted in\ntime and phase as described below. Notice that beyond\nabout t = \u221250Mf the waveforms superpose sufficiently\nwell that it is not possible to distinguish the curves in the\nplot.

Following the discussion\nin Sec. IV, we measure the radiation energy extracted at\nrex = 30M , estimating that these will be accurate within\n\u223c 1%. We subtract the radiation energy Erad from the\ninitial mass M0 , given in Table I, to determine the final black hole mass in each simulation, Mf = M0 \u2212 Erad.\nThis provides a physical scaling which we use to compare\nthe R1-R4 simulations. Similarly, we measure the angular momentum content of the radiation Jrad as extracted\nat rex = 50M , estimating the accuracy to be within a\nfew percent. Subtracting this from the initial ADM angular momentum J0 , we calculate the spin parameter of\nthe final black hole a/Mf = (J0 \u2212 Jrad )/Mf2 .

The curves have been shifted such that the maxima\nare all at time 0. The inset zooms into the peak showing\nthe strong agreement from t = \u221250Mf on. We have used\nthe amplitude peak as a reference to align our simulations in\ntime.\n\nwhere, for simplicity, we have suppressed retarded time\ndependence. Hereafter we suppress the multipole labels\nand refer to the leading component simply as r\u03a84 . The\ntwo polarization components of the radiation are represented in the real and imaginary parts of r\u03a84 . We follow Refs. [14, 25], representing our waveforms by r\u03a84 =\nA exp(\u2212i\u03c6pol ), where the amplitude A and polarization\nphase \u03c6pol , like r\u03a84 , are functions of time. Of course, any\ncomplex time-series could be represented in this form,\nbut it is particularly valuable if the radiation exhibits\na circular polarization pattern, so that A and \u03c6pol vary\nslowly compared to the wave frequency timescale. Such\nradiation will be circularly polarized to an observer on\nthe system's rotational axis, varying to linearly polarization for an observer on the equatorial plane. We find that\nthe radiation produced in our simulations shows strong\ncircular polarization, which we will utilize in comparing\nthe radiation from our four simulations.\nAs we are interested in the degree to which our various runs may be taken to be different models of the same\nphysical merger spacetime, we must define a physical basis for comparing them. As expected, runs beginning\nwith more separated black holes take a longer time to\nreach the point of merger. For each run, a physical reference time is recognizable by the point at which the\nradiation reaches its peak amplitude; we define t = 0 at\nthis point for our comparisons.\nFig. 6 shows the wave amplitudes A(t) from all four\nruns. Through the strong radiation peak after t =\n\u221250Mf all four wave amplitudes show striking universality in the compared results, with agreement among\nall runs to about 1%. This period of strong agreement\ncovers roughly the last orbit, plunge and ringdown of\nthe merger.

The phase is\nmade to agree at time t = 0Mf . After t = \u221250Mf the phases\nagree very well for all the runs. For the duration of the runs\n(except for a brief initial period), the waveforms from all runs\nagree in phase within about 10% of a wave cycle.\n\nslightly more difference in the R1 run. The smooth shape\nof the peak, lacking any sign of the several wave cycles\nspanning the peak (see Fig. 5) is an indication of the\ncircular polarization pattern discussed above. The only\nclearly non-universal feature in the wave amplitudes is a\nsmall and brief burst lasting about 50Mf at the beginning of each run. We interpret this burst as \"spurious\nradiation\" content in the initial data. As generally expected the amplitude of the spurious radiation lessens as\nthe initial separation of the black holes is increased.\nSince the black holes in our various runs (which all begin on the y-axis) undertake differing amounts of orbital\nmotion before merger, we must expect differing orientations for the systems at the point of merger. For meaningful comparsions we must rotate the data from each\nsystem to align them with repect to some physical reference. As our reference, we will orient the systems so\nthat the polarization phase \u03c6pol of the radiation passes\nthough zero at the moment of peak amplitude t = 0.\nWe use this orientation for all figures with wave phase\ninformation, and in the trajectory comparison in Fig. 4.\nThe polarization phase \u03c6pol is shown in Fig. 7. At\ntime t = 0Mf the phases are set to agree. However,\nthey keep agreeing after that, showing that the ringdown\nfrequency is the same. The plot shows generally good\nphase agreement among all runs, to within a small fraction of a wave cycle, except for a brief period at the\nbeginning of each run when the radiation is dominated\nby spurious radiation associated with initial data modeling error, and is not circularly polarized. For circularly\npolarized radiation it is meaningful to define an instantaneous frequency for the wave, \u03c9 = \u2202\u03c6pol /\u2202t, shown in\nFig. 8, which allows a more detailed comparison of the\nsimulation waveforms. It can be seen that apart from the\nnoise due to the smallness of the waves initially and at\nthe end, all runs have the same frequency evolution from\n\n-300\n\n-200\n\n-100\n\n0\n\nt / Mf\n\nt / Mf\n\nFIG. 8: Waveform frequency as a function of time. The curves\nare nearly indisinguishable after t = \u221250Mf .\n\nabout 60Mf before the merger. Before that the frequency\nevolution compares similarly among the simulations with\nsome wavyness which may correspond to some ellipticity\nin the early part of each simulation's insprial.\nThe final (constant) frequency is the frequency of the\nringdown. Fitting an exponential decay to the amplitudes and using this final frequency we estimate, using\nthe procedure in Ref. [26], the mass and angular momentum of the black hole formed in the merger. These\nestimates provide a description of the final black hole as\ndetermined by its perturbative dynamics. The results\nare listed in Table V. where they can be compared with\nthe independent estimates obtained by subtracting the\nradiation losses from the initial values. The good agreement, to 1 \u2212 2%, provides a measure of energy and angular momentum conservation in each simulation. We also\nnote the strong agreement among our simulations (which\nstart from different separations) on the final state of the\nremnant black hole, with the measures from the R2-R4\nruns consistent with the same value, a/Mf = 0.69(\u00b11%).\nThe R1 value differs by a few percent, which may be a\nconsequence of the shorter duration of this simulation,\nallowing greater sensitivity to initial transient effects.\nC.\n\nTrajectory analysis\n\nIn this section we consider the particle-like dynamics\nof our simulations defined by the coordinate trajectories of our black hole punctures. It is important to be\ncareful in interpreting such coordinate-dependent information which may include non-physical gauge features.\nNonetheless it is worth noting that the Gamma-freezing\ngauge condition applied in our simulations, to the extent\nij\nthat it approximates \u0393\u0303i = \u03b3\u0303,j\n= 0, is similar to the Dirac\ngauge applied in some post-Newtonian calculations, and\nmight be expected to provide a sensible coordinate system at least in weak field regions. In any case, since\nwe apply similar coordinate conditions in each run, the\n\n\f9\n10\nR1\nR2\nR3\nR4\n\n8\n\n\u03a9M\n\u03c9 M/2\n0.2\n\nR / Mf\n\nfrequency\n\n6\n\n4\n\n0.1\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-500\n\n-400\n\n-300\n\n-200\n\n-100\n\n0\n\nt / Mf\n\nFIG. 9: The coordinate separation between the punctures is\nshown for runs R1 - R4 as a function of time. Early on in\neach simulation the separation seems to drop quickly, but all\nruns track together as they approach merger.\n\ncoordinate-based puncture trajectories provide another\nopportunity to identify universal features in our simulations that start from different initial separations.\nRefer again to Fig. 4, which shows the tracks of one\nof the punctures from each of the runs R1 - R4 as they\nspiral into the center. As the black holes descend deeper\ninto the strong field, we see that their paths lock on to\na universal trajectory that takes them into the plunge\nand subsequent merger. This behavior can also be seen\nin Fig. 9, which shows the coordinate separation between\nthe punctures as a function of time. In this case, there is\nstrong agreement among the runs after t \u2248 \u221250Mf . In\nthe earlier part of the simulations there are clear differences among the runs, which are suggestive of ellipticity\nin the initial orbital motion.\nOne way to estimate the utility of such coordinate information is by comparison with our much more invariant\nwaveform data. We can, for instance, compare the coordinate orbital frequency \u03a9 with the waveform frequency\nexamined above. With suitable coordinates, in the weakfield limit, we would expect the orbital frequency to be\napproximately equal to half the gravitational wave frequency. In Fig. 10 we compare the coordinate orbital\nfrequency \u03a9 with half the gravitational wave frequency\nfrom our R4 run. We find that, if we shift the orbital freqency data by about 33M0 , the two curves match very\nwell. Despite some noise in our wave frequency, most\nfeatures in the orbital frequency are tracked in the wave\nfrequency as well. Exceptions occur at the very beginning of the simulation, where our coordinates necessarily\nstart with the punctures non-moving (hence \u03a9 = 0) before the brief period through which the coordinate puncture velocities seem to adapt well to the physical dynamics. Likewise, at late times, we see that the orbital\npuncture frequency continues to grow while the radiation\nfrequency saturates at the quasinormal ringing frequency.\nThis seems to correspond to the expectation that, at late\n\n0\n-600\n\n-400\n\n-200\n\n0\n\nt / Mf\n\nFIG. 10: Orbital and radiation frequencies for R4. We show\nthe evolution of the orbital frequency \u03a9, calculated from the\ncoordinate motion of the punctures, compared with the wave\nfrequency. The good correspondence motivates a closer examination of the coordinate-based puncture trajectories. (Note\nthat the radiation frequency is divided by two since \u03c9 = 2\u03a9.)\n\ntimes, the coordinate motion of the punctures decouples\nfrom the process of radiation generation, with the punctures continuing to fall into the newly formed black hole\nwhile gravitational ring-down radiation is generated in\nthe final black hole's pertubative potential barrier region\nsomewhat outside the horizon.\nThe 33M0 time shift required to realize this agreement\ncan be interpreted as the time required for the gravitational radiation to propagate out to the point where it is\nextracted at rex = 30M . We can utilize this time correspondence to roughly associate phenomena occurring in\nthe strong field region of the simulations with features\nin the radiation. We have used this time-shift to compare the time at which peak radiation is generated in our\nsimulations with Tmerge in Table IV. In our simulations,\nwe find that the merger occurs about 12M before the\nradiation peak is generated.\nIn Fig. 11 we compare the orbital frequencies of the\npuncture trajectories among our R1-R4 runs. As was the\ncase with the wave frequencies we see excellent agreement\namong the runs after t = \u221250Mf . Here we have focused\non the earlier region where the results are not quite as\nuniversal. In each run we notice that after a period of\ninitial angular acceleration the orbital frequencies agree\nto within a few percent. This initial transient period is\nat least partially a coordinate effect (since \u03a9 must begin\nat 0), but the strong similarity with the wave-frequencies\nsuggests that there may be a physical basis for the descrepancies as well. Particularly for R3 and R4, the shape\nof the curves suggests a slow oscillation, perhaps some ellipticity in the motion. For an external comparison, we\nhave included the post-Newtonian frequency evolution\n1.5PN and 2PN order, as provided in Ref. [27], positioned\nin time so that all curves agree near t = \u2212200Mf .

In subsequent work\nwe intend to explore comparisons with post-Newtonian\ncalculations in more detail.\n\nVI.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe have presented a set of numerical simulations representing the last few orbits and merger of an equal-mass\nnon-spinning binary black hole system. Though the initial data differ, with the black holes starting out at separations ranging from 9M to 13M , the calculated waveforms are dominated by universal characteristics. Over\nthe period beginning from about 50M before the gravitational wave peak, and covering approximately the last\norbit, all our simulations show profound agreement, with\ndifferences among the waveforms at no more than about\n1%. The robustness of this part of our waveform is strong\nevidence that it accurately represents the final burst of\ngravitational radiation from an astrophysical system of\nequal-mass, non-spinning black holes, as predicted by\nEinstein's field equations.\nWe also see good agreement among our simulations in\nthe gravitational radiation generated in the several preceding orbits which we have simulated. Excepting an initial transient period about 100M for each run, the earlier\nportion of the waveforms show good agreement, within\napproximately 10% in phasing and amplitude. For our\nlongest simulation (R4) this suggests that we have produced a good approximation of the astrophysical waveform prediction covering more than 400M before the radiation peak. We are further encouraged by good agreement over much of this period among the frequency evolution of our simulated waveforms (especially R4), with\nthe second-order (2PN) post-Newtonian predictions. We\n\nare currently exploring the correspondence of our waveforms with post-Newtonian calculations, to be developed\nin more detail in a future publication.\nThat the late-time part of the simulations (the final orbit and thereafter) shows stronger universality than the\nearlier part of the simulations supports idea that the late\ndynamics of the system is dominated by the strong interaction of the holes, and radiative losses, which have the\neffect of reducing dependence on prior conditions. For\nthe remnant black hole formed in the merger, our simulations consistently predict a spin within about 1% of\na/m = 0.69.\nOur simulations have employed newly developed numerical relativity techniques for evolving black holes,\nwhich allows the black holes to propagate accurately\nacross the numerical domain[8, 9]. This approach does\nnot require excision of the black hole interior from the\ncomputational domain. We have calibrated our approach\non one of our black hole configurations, R1, demonstrating 2nd -order convergence, and waveform accuracy at the\n1% level in the last orbit. For all our simulations we have\nfound good energy and angular momentum conservation\nas measured by comparing the mass and spin of the final black hole, measured by its quasinormal ringing, with\nthe expected remainder after radiative losses. In future\nwork we expect to continue to refine our techniques for\naccuracy and efficiency over long-lasting simulations.\nWe have also studied the trajectories traced out by the\nmotion of the black holes in our numerical coordinate system. These trajectories suggest a coherent picture of the\nsystem's evolution which is qualitatively, and in some\nways, quantitatively consistent with invariant information measured in the radiation waveforms. This correspondence provides some foundation for giving a tentative physical interpretation to some coordinate-based information in our simulations, such as the number and\nrate of inspiral orbits, and recommends further research\ntoward a deeper understanding of the properties of the\ncoordinate systems which we have applied in these simulations.\nOur comparative analysis provides some insight into\nthe quality of the initial data models which we have applied. We have seen an indication of a small amount\n(with negligible energy content) of spurious radiation\narising from initial modeling error. As generally expected\nthe scale of this spurious radiation decreases for increasingly well-separated initial data. For sufficiently longlasting runs this spurious radiation is well-segregated in\ntime, limiting its direct significance in interpreting the\nmerger radiation. Of perhaps greater concern are indications which suggest ellipticity in the inspiral trajectories and waveforms. Two aspects of our initial data\nmodel may be contributing to this effect. First, the will\nbe some level of mismatch between the initial separation of the black holes and the specified initial value of\nangular momentum. We comment, in this regard, that\nother simulations we have looked at in preparation for the\nwork presented here hint that the early transient part of\n\n\f11\neach simulation, as well as measures such as the merger\ntimes, may depend sensitively on small (1%) changes in\nthe initial angular momentum. Secondly, as is customary, the data we have applied have the black holes set on\ninitially circular trajectories, with vanishing radial momentum components. This may also be expected to lead\nto ellipticity, as has been noted in binary neutron star\nsimulations [28]. We expect to explore these and similar\nconcerns in future simulations.\nTaken together with other recent progress in numerical relativity, these results herald a new age of numerical simulations applied to further characterize and understand strong-field binary black hole interactions and\nmerger radiation. Future applications will begin to explore the physical parameter space of these systems to\nstudy, particularly, the effect on the radiation waveforms\nof individual black hole spin, and variations in the black\n\nhole mass ratio.\n\n[1] A.
