We also prove that every\ngraph which can be made planar by removing one edge is 5-choosable.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe crossing number of a graph G, denoted by cr(G), is the minimum number of crossings in\nany drawing of G in the plane.\nThe Four Colour Theorem states that, if a graph has crossing number zero (i.e. is planar),\nthen it is 4-colourable. Deleting one vertex per crossing, it follows that \u03c7(G) \u2264 4 + cr(G). So\nit is natural to ask for the smallest integer f (k) such that every graph G with crossing number\nat most k \u0010is f (k)-colourable?\nSettling a conjecture of Albertson [1], Schaefer [8] showed that\n\u0011\nf (k) = O k1/4 . This upper bound is tight up to a constant factor since \u03c7(Kn ) = n and cr(Kn ) \u2264\nn \u0001\n|E(Kn )|\u0001\n= (2) \u2264 1 n4 .\n2\n\n2\n\n8\n\nThe values of f (k) are known for a number of small values of k. The Four Colour Theorem states f (0) = 4 and implies easily that f (1) \u2264 5. Since cr(K5 ) = 1, we have f (1) = 5.\nOporowski and Zhao [7] showed that f (2) = 5. Since cr(K6 ) = 3, we have f (3) = 6. Further,\nAlbertson et al. [2] showed that f (6) = 6. Albertson then conjectured that if \u03c7(G) = r, then\ncr(G) \u2264 cr(Kr ). This conjecture was proved by Bar\u00e1t and T\u00f3th [3] for r \u2264 16.\nA list assignment of a graph G is a function L that assigns to each vertex v \u2208 V (G) a list L(v)\nS\nof available colours. An L-colouring is a function \u03c6 : V (G) \u2192 v L(v) such that \u03c6(v) \u2208 L(v)\nfor every v \u2208 V (G) and \u03c6(u) 6= \u03c6(v) whenever u and v are adjacent vertices of G. If G admits\nan L-colouring, then it is L-colourable. A graph G is k-choosable if it is L-colourable for every\nlist assignment L such that |L(v)| \u2265 k for all v \u2208 V (G). The choose number of G, denoted by\nch(G), is the minimum k such that G is k-choosable.\nSimilarly to the chromatic number, one may seek for bounds on the choose number of\na graph with few crossings or with independent crossings. Thomassen's Five Colour Theorem [10] states that if a graph has crossing number zero (i.e. is planar) then it is 5-choosable.\n\u2217 This\n\nwork was partially supported by Equipe Associ\u00e9e EWIN.\ndo Cear\u00e1, Departamento de Computa\u00e7ao, Bloco 910, Campus do Pici, Fortaleza, Cear\u00e1,\nCEP 60455-760, Brasil. campos@lia.ufc.br; Partially supported by CNPq/Brazil.\n\u2021 Projet Mascotte, I3S(CNRS, UNSA) and INRIA, 2004 route des lucioles, BP 93, 06902 Sophia-Antipolis\nCedex, France.

Erman et al. [5] observed that Thomassen's result can be extended to graphs with\ncrossing number at most 1. Deleting one vertex per crossing yields ch(G) \u2264 4 + cr(G). Hence,\nwhat is the smallest integer g(k) such that every graph G with crossing number at most k is\ng(k)-choosable? Obviously, since \u03c7(G) \u2264 ch(G), we have f (k) \u2264 g(k).\nIn this paper, we extend Erman et al. result in two ways. We first show that every graph\nwhich can be made planar by the removal of an edge is 5-choosable (Theorem 3). We then\nprove that is g(2) = 5. In other words, every graph with crossing number 2 is 5-choosable1 .\nThis generalizes the result of Oporowski and Zhao [7] to list colouring.\n\n2\n\nPlanar graphs plus an edge\n\nIn order to prove its Five Colour Theorem, Thomassen [10] showed a stronger result.\nDefinition 1. An inner triangulation is a plane graph such that every face of G is bounded by a\ntriangle except its outer face which is bounded by a cycle.\nLet G be a plane graph and x and y two consecutive vertices on its outer face F. A list\nassignment L of G is {x, y}-suitable if\n- |L(x)| \u2265 1, |L(y)| \u2265 2,\n- for every v \u2208 V (F) \\ {x, y}, |L(v)| \u2265 3, and\n- for every v \u2208 V (G) \\V (F), |L(v)| \u2265 5.\nA list assignment of G is suitable if it is {x, y}-suitable for some vertices x and y on the outer\nface of G.\nThe following theorem is a straightforward generalization of Thomassen's five colour Theorem which holds for non-separable plane graphs.\nTheorem 2 (Thomassen [10]). If L is a suitable list assignment of a plane graph G then G is\nL-colourable.\nThis result is the cornerstone of the following proof.\nTheorem 3. Let G be a graph. If G has an edge such that G \\ e is planar then ch(G) \u2264 5.\nProof. Let e = uv be an edge of G such that G \\ e is planar. Let G\u2032 be a planar triangulation\ncontaining G \\ e as a subgraph. Without loss of generality, we may assume that u is on the outer\ntriangle of G\u2032 . The graph G\u2032 \u2212 u has an outer cycle C\u2032 whose vertices are the neighbours of u in\nG\u2032 .\nLet L be a 5-list assignment of G. Let \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 L(u). Let L\u2032 be the list-assignment of G\u2032 \u2212 u\ndefined by L\u2032 (w) = L(w) \\ {\u03b1, \u03b2} if w \u2208 V (C\u2032 ) and L\u2032 (w) = L(w) otherwise. Then L\u2032 is suitable.\nSo G\u2032 \u2212 u admits an L\u2032 -colouring by Theorem 2. This colouring may be extended into an Lcolouring of G by assigning to u a colour in {\u03b1, \u03b2} different from the colour of v.\nHence G is 5-choosable.\n1 While\n\nwriting this paper, we discovered that Dvo\u0159\u00e1k et al. [4] independently proved this result. Their proof\nhas some similarity to ours but is different. They prove by induction a stronger result, while we use the existence\nof a shortest path between the two crossings which satisfies some given properties.\n\n2\n\n\f3\n\nGraphs with two crossings\n\n3.1 Preliminaries\nWe first recall the celebrated characterization of planar graphs due to Kuratowski [6]. See also\n[9] for a nice proof.\nTheorem 4 (Kuratowski [6]). A graph is planar if and only if it contains no minor isomorphic\nto either K5 or K3,3 .\nLet G be a plane graph and x, y and z three distinct vertices on the outer face F of G. A list\nassignment L of G is (x, y, z)-correct if\n- |L(x)| = 1 = |L(y)| and L(x) 6= L(y),\n- |L(z)| \u2265 3,\n- for every v \u2208 V (F) \\ {x, y, z}, |L(v)| \u2265 4, and\n- for every v \u2208 V (G) \\V (F), |L(v)| \u2265 5.\nIf L is (x, y, z)-correct and L(z) \u2265 4, we say that L is {x, y}-correct.\nLemma 5. Let G be an inner triangulation and x and y two distinct vertices on the outer face\nof G. If L is an (x, y, z)-correct list assignment of G then G is L-colourable.\nProof. We prove the result by induction on the number of vertices, the result holding trivially\nwhen |V (G)| = 3.\nSuppose first that F has a chord xt. Then xt lies in two unique cycles in F \u222a xt, one C1\ncontaining y and the other C2 . For i = 1, 2, let Gi denote the subgraph induced by the vertices\nlying on Ci or inside it. By the induction hypothesis, there exists an L-colouring \u03c61 of G1 . Let\nL2 be the list assignment on G2 defined by L2 (t) = {\u03c61 (t)} and L2 (u) = L(u) if u \u2208 V (G2 ) \\ {t}.\nLet z\u2032 = z if z \u2208 V (C2 ) and z\u2032 be any vertex of V (C2 ) \\ {x,t} otherwise. Then L2 is (x,t, z\u2032)correct for G2 so G2 admits an L2 -colouring \u03c62 by induction hypothesis. The union of \u03c61 and\n\u03c62 is an L-colouring of G.\nSuppose now that x has exactly two neighbours u and v on F. Let u, u1 , u2 . . . , um , v be\nthe neighbours of x in their natural cyclic order around x. As G is an inner triangulation,\nuu1 u2 * * * um , v = P is a path. Hence the graph G \u2212 x has F \u2032 = P \u222a (F \u2212 x) as outer face.\nAssume first that z \u2208\n/ {u, v}. Then let L\u2032 be the list assignment on G \u2212 x defined by L\u2032 (w) =\nL(w) \\ L(x) if w \u2208 NG (x) and L\u2032 (w) = L(w) otherwise. Clearly, |L\u2032 (w)| \u2265 3 if w \u2208 F \u2032 and\n|L\u2032 (w)| \u2265 5 otherwise. Hence, by Theorem 2, G \u2212 x admits an L\u2032 -colouring. Colouring x with\nthe colour of its list, we obtain an L-colouring of G.\nAssume now that z \u2208 {u, v}, say z = u. Let \u03b1 be a colour of L(z) \\ (L(x) \u222a L(y)). Let L\u2032 be\nthe list assignment on G \u2212 x defined by L\u2032 (z) = {\u03b1}, L\u2032 (w) = L(w) \\ L(x) if w \u2208 NG (x) \\ {z}\nand L\u2032 (w) = L(w) otherwise. Clearly, L\u2032 is (y, z, v)-correct. Hence, by the induction hypothesis,\nG \u2212 x admits an L\u2032 -colouring. Colouring x with the colour of its list, we obtain an L-colouring\nof G.\n\n3.2 Nice, great and good paths\nLet G be a graph and H an induced subgraph of G.\n\n3\n\n\fWe denote by ZH the set of vertices of G which are adjacent to at least 3 vertices of H. For\nevery vertex v in V (G), we denote by NH (v) the set of vertices of H adjacent to v, and we set\ndH (v) = |NH (v)|.\nLet L be a list assignment of G. For any L-colouring \u03c6 of H, we denote by L\u03c6 the list\nassignment of G \u2212 H defined by L\u03c6 (z) = L(z) \\ \u03c6(NH (z)). A vertex z \u2208 V (G \u2212 H) is safe (with\nrespect to \u03c6), if |L\u03c6 (z)| \u2265 3. An L-colouring of H is safe if all vertices of z \u2208 V (G \u2212 H) are safe.\nObserve that if L is a 5-list assignment, then for any L-colouring \u03c6 of H, every vertex z not in\nZH has at most two neighbours in H and therefore |L\u03c6 (z)| \u2265 3. Hence \u03c6 is safe if and only if\nevery vertex in ZH is safe.\nLet P = v1 * * * v p be an induced path in G. For 2 \u2264 i \u2264 p \u2212 1, we denote by [vi ]P , or simply\n[vi ] if P is clear from the context, the set {vi\u22121 , vi , vi+1 }. We say that a vertex z is adjacent to [vi ]\nif it is adjacent to all vertices in the set [vi ]. Note that if z is adjacent to [vi ] then z is not in P as\nP is induced.\nLemma 6. Let P = v1 * * * v p be an induced path in G, x a vertex such that NP (x) = [vi+1 ],\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 p \u2212 1, and \u03c6 a colouring of P \u2212 vi . If i = 1 or \u03c6(vi\u22121 ) = \u03c6(vi+1 ), then one can extend \u03c6\nto vi such that x is safe.\nProof. If {\u03c6(vi+1 ), \u03c6(vi+2 )} 6\u2282 L(x), then assigning to vi any colour distinct from \u03c6(vi+1 ), we\nget a colouring of P such that x is safe. So we may assume that {\u03c6(vi+1 ), \u03c6(vi+2)} \u2282 L(x).\nIf \u03c6(vi+2 ) \u2208 L(vi ), then setting \u03c6(vi ) = \u03c6(vi+2 ), we have a colouring \u03c6 such that x is safe. If\nnot, there is a colour \u03b1 in L(vi ) \\ L(x). Necessarily, \u03b1 6= \u03c6(vi+1 ) and so one can colour vi with\n\u03b1. Doing so, we obtain a colouring such that x is safe.\nLet P = v1 * * * v p be an induced path. It is a nice path in G if the following are true.\n(a) for every z \u2208 ZP , NP (z) = [vi ] for some 2 \u2264 i \u2264 p \u2212 1;\n(b) for every 2 \u2264 i \u2264 p \u2212 1, there are at most two vertices adjacent to [vi ] and, if there are two\nsuch vertices, then the number of vertices adjacent to [vi\u22121 ] or [vi+1 ] is at most 1.\nIt is a great path in G if is is nice and satisfies the following extra property.\n(c) for any i < j, if there are two vertices adjacent to [vi ] and two vertices adjacent to [v j ],\nthen the number of vertices adjacent to [vi+1 ] or [v j\u22121 ] is at most 1.\nA safe colouring of a path P = v1 * * * v p is \u03b1-safe if \u03c6(v1 ) = \u03b1.\nLemma 7. If P is a great path and L is a 5-list assignment of G, then for any \u03b1 \u2208 L(v1 ), there\nexists an \u03b1-safe L-colouring \u03c6 of P.\nProof. We prove this result by induction on p, the number of vertices of P, the result holding\ntrivially when p \u2264 2.\nAssume now that p \u2265 3. Since P is great then every vertex of ZP adjacent to v1 is also\nadjacent to v2 and there are at most two vertices of ZP adjacent to [v2 ].\nSet \u03c6(v1 ) = \u03b1.\n1. If there is no vertex adjacent to [v2 ], then by induction, for any \u03b2 \u2208 L(v2 ) \\ {\u03b1}, there is a\n\u03b2-safe L-colouring \u03c6 of v2 * * * v p . Since \u03c6(v1 ) = \u03b1, \u03c6 is an \u03b1-safe L-colouring of P.\n\n4\n\n\f2. Assume now that there is a unique vertex z adjacent to [v2 ].\nIf \u03b1 \u2208\n/ L(z), then by Case 1, there is an \u03b1-safe L-colouring \u03c6 of P in G \u2212 z. It is also\nan \u03b1-safe L-colouring of P in G since z is safe as \u03b1 \u2208\n/ L(z). Hence we may assume that\n\u03b1 \u2208 L(z).\nAssume there is a colour \u03b2 in L(v2 ) \\ {\u03b1}. By induction there is a \u03b2-safe L-colouring \u03c6\nof v2 * * * v p . Since \u03c6(v1 ) = \u03b1, we obtain an \u03b1-safe L-colouring of P because z is safe as\n\u03b2\u2208\n/ L(z). Hence we may assume that L(v2 ) = L(z). In particular, \u03b1 \u2208 L(v2 ). Let \u03b3 be\n\u03b1 if \u03b1 \u2208 L(v3 ), and a colour in L(v3 ) \\ L(v2 ) otherwise. We set \u03c6(v3 ) = \u03b3. Observe that\nwhatever colour is assigned to v2 , the vertex z will be safe.\n2.1. Assume that no vertex is adjacent to [v3 ]. By induction hypothesis, there is a \u03b3-safe\nL-colouring \u03c6 of v3 * * * v p . Choosing \u03c6(v2 ) in L(v2 ) \\ {\u03b1, \u03b3}, we obtain an \u03b1-safe\nL-colouring of P.\n2.2. Assume that exactly one vertex t is adjacent to [v3 ]. By induction hypothesis, there\nis a \u03b3-safe L-colouring \u03c6 of v3 * * * v p . So far all the vertices except t will be safe. So\nwe just need to choose \u03c6(v2 ) so that t is safe.\nObserve that if {\u03b3, \u03c6(v4 )} 6\u2282 L(t), choosing any colour of L(v2 ) \\ {\u03b1, \u03b3} will do the\njob. So we may assume that {\u03b3, \u03c6(v4 )} \u2282 L(t). If there is a colour \u03b2 \u2208 L(v2 ) \\\n(L(t) \u222a {\u03b1}), then setting L(v2 ) = \u03b2 will make t safe. So we may assume that\nL(v2 ) \\ {\u03b1} \u2282 L(t) and so L(t) = L(v2 ) \u222a {\u03b3} \\ {\u03b1}. Thus \u03c6(v4 ) \u2208 L(v2 ) \\ {\u03b1, \u03b3}.\nThen setting \u03c6(v2 ) = \u03c6(v4 ) makes t safe.\n2.3. Assume that two vertices t1 and t2 are adjacent to [v3 ]. Then no vertex is adjacent to\n[v4 ]. Therefore, it suffices to prove that there is an \u03b1-safe L-colouring of v1 v2 v3 v4 .\nIndeed, if we have such a colouring \u03c6, then by induction, v4 * * * v p admits a \u03c6(v4 )safe L-colouring \u03c6\u2032 . The union of these two colourings is an \u03b1-safe L-colouring of\nP.\nIf there exists \u03b2 \u2208 L(v4 )\u2229L(v2 )\\{\u03b1, \u03b3}, then setting \u03c6(v2 ) = \u03c6(v4 ) = \u03b2, we obtain an\n\u03b1-safe L-colouring of v1 v2 v3 v4 . Otherwise, L(v4 ) \\ {\u03b3} and L(v2 ) \\ {\u03b1} are disjoint.\nHence one can choose \u03b2 in L(v2 )\\{\u03b1} and \u03b4 in L(v4 )\\{\u03b3} so that |{\u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4}\u2229L(ti)| \u2264\n2 for i = 1, 2. Setting \u03c6(v2 ) = \u03b2 and \u03c6(v4 ) = \u03b4, we obtain an \u03b1-safe L-colouring of\nv1 v2 v3 v4 .\n3. Assume that two vertices z1 and z2 are adjacent to [v2 ].\nWe claim that it suffices to prove that there is an \u03b1-safe L-colouring of v1 v2 v3 .\nLet j be the smallest index such that no vertex is adjacent to [v j ]. For the definition of\nj, consider there is no vertex adjacent to [v p ] so that j \u2264 p. By the property (c) of great\npath, for all 3 \u2264 i < j, there is exactly one vertex zi adjacent to [vi ]. For i = 3, . . ., j \u2212 1,\none after another, one can use Lemma 6 in the path vi+1 * * * v1 to extend \u03c6 to vi+1 , so that\nzi is safe. Then applying induction on the path v j * * * v p , we obtain an \u03b1-safe L-colouring.\nThis proves the claim.\nLet us now prove that an \u03b1-safe L-colouring of v1 v2 v3 exists.\nIf \u03b1 \u2208\n/ L(zi ), then any \u03b1-safe L-colouring of v1 v2 v3 in G \u2212 zi will be an \u03b1-safe L-colouring\nin G. By Case 2, one can find such a colouring in G \u2212zi , so we may assume that \u03b1 \u2208 L(zi ).\nIf there is a colour \u03b2 \u2208 L(v2 ) \\ L(z1 ), then set \u03c6(v2 ) = \u03b2. By Lemma 6 in the path v3 v2 v1 ,\none can choose \u03c6(v3 ) in L(v3 ) to obtain an \u03b1-safe L-colouring of v1 v2 v3 . Hence we may\nassume that L(z1 ) = L(v2 ). Similarly, we may assume that L(z2 ) = L(v2 ). Therefore, any\n5\n\n\f\u03b1-safe L-colouring of v1 v2 v3 in G \u2212 z2 will be an \u03b1-safe L-colouring in G. We can find\nsuch a colouring using Case 2.\n\nWe say that an induced path P = v1 * * * v p is good path if either P is great or p \u2265 4 and\nthere is a vertex z \u2208 ZP adjacent to v1 such that {v1 , v4 } \u2282 NP (z) \u2286 {v1 , v2 , v3 , v4 } satisfying the\nfollowing conditions:\n\u2022 P is a great path in G \\ v1 z.\n\u2022 if two vertices distinct from z are adjacent to [v2 ], then NP (z) = {v1 , v3 , v4 } and there is\nno vertex adjacent to [v3 ]; and\n\u2022 if two vertices distinct from z are adjacent to [v3 ], then NP (z) = {v1 , v2 , v4 } and there is\nno vertex adjacent to [v2 ].\nNote that since P is induced, then z is not in P.\nLemma 8. If P = v1 * * * v p is a good path and L is a 5-list assignment of G, then there exists a\nsafe L-colouring of P.\nProof. If P is great, then the result follows from Lemma 7. So we may assume that P is not\ngreat. Let z be the vertex of ZP such that {v1 , v4 } \u2282 NP (z) \u2286 {v1 , v2 , v3 , v4 }.\nIf there is a colour \u03b1 \u2208 L(v1 ) \\ L(z), then let \u03c6(v1 ) = \u03b1 and use Lemma 7 to colour v1 * * * v p\nin G \\ v1 z. The obtained colouring \u03c6 is a safe L-colouring of P. For any z\u2032 \u2208 ZP \\ {z}, we have\n|L\u03c6 (z\u2032 )| \u2265 3 because z\u2032 has the same neighbourhood in G and G \\ v1 z. Now |L\u03c6 (z)| \u2265 3 since\n\u03b1\u2208\n/ L(z), so \u03c6 is safe. Henceforth, we assume that L(v1 ) = L(z).\n1. Assume first that NP (z) = {v1 , v2 , v3 , v4 }.\nBy the properties of a good path, at most one vertex z\u2032 different from z is adjacent to [v2 ].\n1.1. Assume first that z is the unique vertex adjacent to [v3 ].\nIf there is a colour \u03b1 \u2208 L(z) \u2229 L(v3 ), then set \u03c6(v1 ) = \u03c6(v3 ) = \u03b1. By Lemma 7, one\ncan extend \u03c6 to v3 * * * v p so that all vertices of ZP but z are safe. Then by Lemma 6\napplied to v2 * * * v p , one can choose \u03c6(v2 ) \u2208 L(v2 ) so that z is safe for P \u2212 v1 . Since\n\u03c6(v1 ) = \u03c6(v3 ), then \u03c6 is a proper colouring and z is safe for P. Hence \u03c6 is a safe\n/\nL-colouring of P. So we may assume that L(z) \u2229 L(v3 ) = 0.\nIf there exists \u03b2 \u2208 L(v2 ) \\ L(z), then set \u03c6(v2 ) = \u03b2. By Lemma 7, one can extend \u03c6\nto v2 * * * v p so that all vertices of ZP but z and z\u2032 are safe. Observe that necessarily z\nwill be safe because \u03c6(v2 ) \u2208\n/ L(z) and \u03c6(v3 ) \u2208\n/ L(z). By Lemma 6, one can extend \u03c6\n\u2032\nto v1 so that z is safe, thus getting a safe L-colouring of P. So we may assume that\nL(v2 ) = L(z).\nWe have |L(v2 ) \u222a L(v3 )| = 10 \u2265 |L(z\u2032 )|. So we can find \u03b1 \u2208 L(v2 ) and \u03b2 \u2208 L(v3 )\nso that |{\u03b1, \u03b2} \u2229 L(z\u2032 )| \u2264 1. Using Lemma 7 take a \u03b2-safe L-colouring \u03c6 of the\npath v3 v4 . . . v p and set \u03c6(v2 ) = \u03b1. If \u03c6(v4 ) \u2208 L(z) \\ {\u03b1}, then colour v1 with \u03c6(v4 ),\notherwise colour it with any colour distinct from \u03b1. This gives a safe L-colouring of\nP.\n1.2 Assume now that a vertex y 6= z is adjacent to [v3 ].\n\n6\n\n\f\u2217 Suppose that a vertex t is adjacent to [v4 ]. Then z\u2032 does not exist.\nIf there is a colour \u03b1 \u2208 L(v2 ) \\ L(z), then using Lemma 7 take an \u03b1-safe Lcolouring \u03c6 of v2 * * * v p . If \u03c6(v3 ) \u2208\n/ L(z), then z would be safe whatever colour\nwe assign to v1 , so there is a safe L-colouring of P. If If \u03c6(v3 ) \u2208 L(z), then\nsetting \u03c6(v1 ) = \u03c6(v3 ), we obtain a safe L-colouring of P. So we may assume\nthat L(v2 ) = L(z).\nIf there is a colour \u03b1 in L(z) \u2229 L(v4 ), then set \u03c6(v2 ) = \u03c6(v4 ) = \u03b1. Then y will\nbe safe. Extend \u03c6 to v4 * * * v p by Lemma 7. Then all the vertices are safe except\nt and z. By Lemma 6, one can choose \u03c6(v3 ) so that t is safe. If \u03c6(v3 ) \u2208 L(z),\nthen setting \u03c6(v1 ) = \u03c6(v3 ), we get a safe L-colouring of P. If \u03c6(v3 ) \u2208\n/ L(z), then\nwhatever colour we assign to v1 , we obtain a safe colouring of P. Hence we\n/ By Lemma 7, there is a safe L-colouring of\nmay assume that L(z) \u2229 L(v4 ) = 0.\nP in G \\ zv4 . This colouring is also a safe colouring of P in G, since \u03c6(v4 ) is not\nin L(z).\n\u2217 If no vertex is adjacent to [v4 ], then z\u2032 may exist. In this case, it is sufficient to\nprove that there exists a safe L-colouring of v1 v2 v3 v4 . Indeed, if there is such a\ncolouring \u03c6, then by Lemma 7, it can be extended to a safe L-colouring of P.\nSymmetrically to the way we proved the result when L(v1 ) 6= L(z), one can\nprove it when L(v4 ) 6= L(z). Hence we may assume that L(v4 ) = L(z).\nAssume that there is a colour \u03b1 \u2208 L(v2 ) \u2229 L(z). Set \u03c6(v2 ) = \u03c6(v4 ) = \u03b1. If there\nis a colour \u03b2 \u2208 L(v3 ) \\ L(z), then set \u03c6(v3 ) = \u03b2 so that z will be safe and extend\n\u03c6 with Lemma 6 so that z\u2032 is safe to obtain a safe colouring of v1 v2 v3 v4 in G. If\nL(v3 ) = L(z), then assign to v1 and v3 a same colour in L(z) \\ {\u03b1} to get a safe\ncolouring of v1 v2 v3 v4 .\n/ Symmetrically, we may assume\nHence we may assume that L(v2 ) \u2229 L(z) = 0.\n/ By Lemma 7, there exists a safe colouring \u03c6 of v1 v2 v3 v4\nthat L(v3 ) \u2229 L(z) = 0.\nin G \u2212 z. It is also a safe colouring of v1 v2 v3 v4 in G because \u03c6(v2 ) and \u03c6(v3 )\ncannot be in L(z).\n2. Assume now that NP (z) = {v1 , v3 , v4 }.\nIf no vertex is adjacent to [v2 ], then using Lemma 7 take a safe L-colouring of v2 . . . v p . If\n\u03c6(v3 ) \u2208 L(z), then set \u03c6(v1 ) = \u03c6(v3 ). If not colour v3 with any colour in L(z) \\ {\u03c6(v2 )}.\nThis gives a safe L-colouring of P. Hence we may assume that a vertex t is adjacent to\n[v2 ].\nBy the properties of a good path, we know that at most one vertex, say u, is adjacent to\nv3 . If L(v3 ) \u2229 L(z) is empty, then any safe L-colouring of P given by Lemma 7 in G \\ zv1\nwould be a safe L-colouring of P. Hence we may assume that there is a colour \u03b1 in\nL(v3 ) \u2229 L(z). Set \u03c6(v1 ) = \u03c6(v3 ) = \u03b1 and apply Lemma 7 to v3 . . . v p . Then by Lemma 6,\nwe can choose \u03c6(v2 ) so that the possible vertex u is safe. This gives a safe colouring of P.\n3. Assume that NP (z) = {v1 , v2 , v4 }.\nSuppose no vertex is adjacent to [v2 ]. By Lemma 7, there is a safeL- colouring of v2 . . . v p .\nSet \u03c6(v1 ) = \u03c6(v4 ) if \u03c6(v4 ) \u2208 L(z) \\ {\u03c6(v2 )}, and let \u03c6(v1 ) be any colour of L(v1 ) \\ {\u03c6(v2 )}\notherwise. Doing so z is safe and so \u03c6 is a safe L-colouring of P. Hence we may assume\nthat a vertex u is adjacent to [v2 ]. By definition of good path, it is the unique vertex\nadjacent to [v2 ].\nSuppose that there exists a colour \u03b2 in L(v2 ) \\ L(z). By Lemma 7, there is a safe colouring\n\u03c6 of v2 . . . v p such that \u03c6(v2 ) = \u03b2. By Lemma 6, it can be extended to v1 so that u is safe.\n7\n\n\fThis yields a safe L-colouring of P.

Hence any safe\nIf L(v4 ) \u2229 L(z) = 0,\ncolouring of P in G \u2212 z, (there is one by Lemma 7) is a safe L-colouring of P in G. So we\nmay assume that there exists a colour \u03b1 \u2208 L(v4 ) \u2229 L(z).\nAssume that at most one vertex s is adjacent to [v4 ]. Set \u03c6(v2 ) = \u03c6(v4 ) = \u03b1 so that z and\nall the vertices adjacent to [v3 ] will be safe. By Lemma 7, there is an \u03b1-safe colouring of\nv4 . . . v p . Now by Lemma 6, one can extend \u03c6 to v3 so that s (if it exists) is safe, and then\nagain by Lemma 6 extend it to v1 so that u is safe. This gives a safe L-colouring of P. So\nwe may assume that two vertices s and s\u2032 are adjacent to [v4 ].\nAssume that there is a vertex t adjacent to [v3 ], then there is no vertex adjacent to [v5 ].\nHence it suffices to find a safe L-colouring of v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 . Indeed, if we have such a\ncolouring \u03c6, then using Lemma 7, one can extend it to a safe L-colouring of P. Set\n\u03c6(v2 ) = \u03c6(v4 ) = \u03b1. Doing so t and z will be safe. If \u03b1 or some colour \u03b2 \u2208 L(v5 ) \\ {\u03b1}\nis not contained in one of lists L(s) and L(s\u2032 ), say L(s\u2032 ). Then colouring v5 with \u03b2, if it\nexists, or any other colour otherwise, the vertex s\u2032 will also be safe. By Lemma 6, one\ncan colour v3 so that s is safe. By Lemma 6, one can then colour v1 to obtain a colouring\nfor which u is safe. This L-colouring of v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 is safe. Hence, we may assume that\nL(s) = L(s\u2032 ) = L(v5 ).

(This is possible since L(v2 ) = L(z).) Then z will be safe. By\nLemma 6, colour v1 so that u is safe to obtain a safe L-colouring of P.\n\n3.3 Main theorem\nA drawing of G is nice if two edges intersect at most once. It is well known that every graph\nwith crossing number k has a nice drawing with at most k crossings. (See [5] for example.) In\nthis paper, we will only consider nice drawings. Thus a crossing is uniquely defined by the pair\nof edges it belongs to. Henceforth, we will confound a crossing with this set of two edges. The\ncluster of a crossing C is the set of endvertices of its two edges and is denoted V (C).\nTheorem 9. Let G be a graph having a drawing in the plane with two crossings. Then ch(G) \u2264\n5.\nProof. By considering a counter-example G with the minimum number of vertices. Let L be a\n5-list assignment of G such that G is not L-colourable.\nLet C1 and C2 be the two crossings. By Theorem 3, C1 and C2 have no edge in common.\nSet Ci = {vi wi ,tiui }. Free to add edges and to redraw them along the crossing, we may assume\nthat vi ui , ui wi , witi and ti vi are edges and that the 4-cycle vi ui witi has no vertex inside but the\ntwo edges of Ci . In addition, we assume that u1 v1t1 w1 appear in clockwise order around the\ncrossing point of C1 and that u2 v2t2 w2 appear in counter-clockwise order around the crossing\npoint of C2 . Free to add edges, we may also assume that G \\ {v1w1 , v2 w2 } is a triangulation of\nthe plane. In the rest of the proof, for convenience, we will refer to this fact by writing that G is\ntriangulated.\n8\n\n\fClaim 9.1. Every vertex of G has degree at least 5.\nProof. Suppose not. Then G has a vertex x of degree at most 4. By minimality of G, G \u2212 x has\nan L-colouring \u03c6. Now assigning to x a colour in L(x) \\ \u03c6(N(x)) we obtain an L-colouring of G,\na contradiction.\nA cycle is separating if none of its edges is crossed and both its interior and exterior contain\nat least one vertex. A cycle is nicely separating if it is separating and its interior or its exterior\nhas no crossing.\nClaim 9.2. G has no nicely separating triangle.\nProof. Assume, by way of contradiction, that a triangle T = x1 x2 x3 is nicely separating. Let\nG1 (resp. G2 ) be the subgraph of G induced by the vertices on T or outside T (resp. inside T ).\nWithout loss of generality, we may assume that G2 is a plane graph.\nBy minimality of G, G1 has an L-colouring \u03c61 . Let L2 be the list assignment of G2 defined by\nL2 (x1 ) = {\u03c61 (x1 )}, L2 (x2 ) = {\u03c61 (x1 ), \u03c61 (x2 )}, L2 (x3 ) = {\u03c61 (x1 ), \u03c61 (x2 ), \u03c61 (x3 )}, and L2 (x) =\nL(x) for every vertex inside T . Then L2 is a suitable list assignment of G2 , so by Theorem 2,\nG2 admits an L2 -colouring \u03c62 . Observe that necessarily \u03c62 (xi ) = \u03c61 (xi ). Hence the union of \u03c61\nand \u03c62 is an L-colouring of G, a contradiction.\nClaim 9.3. Let C = abcd be a 4-cycle with no crossing inside it. If a and c have no common\nneighbour inside C then C has no vertex in its interior.\nProof. Assume by way of contradiction that the set S of vertices inside C is not empty.\nThen ac is not an edge otherwise one of the triangles abc and acd would be nicely separating.\nSince G is triangulated, the neighbours of a (resp. c) inside C plus b and d (in cyclic order\naround a (resp. c)) form a (b, d)-path Pa (resp. Pc ). The paths Pa and Pc are internally disjoint\nbecause a and c have no common neighbour inside C. Hence Pa \u222a Pc is a cycle C\u2032 . Furthermore\nC\u2032 is the outerface of G\u2032 = GhS \u222a {b, d}i.\nBy minimality of G, G1 = (G \u2212 S) \u222a bd admits an L-colouring \u03c6. Let L\u2032 be the list-colouring\nof G\u2032 defined by L\u2032 (b) = {\u03c6(b)}, L\u2032 (d) = {\u03c6(d)}, L\u2032 (x) = L(x) \\ {\u03c6(a)} if x is an internal vertex\nof Pa , L\u2032 (x) = L(x) \\ {\u03c6(c)} if x is an internal vertex of Pc , and L\u2032 (x) = L(x) if x \u2208 V (G\u2032 \u2212C\u2032 ).\nThen L\u2032 is a {b, d}-correct list assignment of G\u2032 . Hence, by Lemma 5, G\u2032 admits an L\u2032 -colouring\n\u03c6\u2032 . The union of \u03c6 and \u03c6\u2032 is an L-colouring of G, a contradiction.\nClaim 9.4. G has no nicely separating 4-cycle.\nProof. Suppose not. Then there exists a nicely separating 4-cycle abcd. Let b = z1 , z2 , . . . , z p+1 =\nd be the common neighbours of a and c in clockwise order around a. By Claim 9.3, we have\np \u2265 2. Each of the 4-cycles azi czi+1 , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 p has empty interior by Claim 9.3. So z2 has\ndegree at most 4. This contradicts Claim 9.1.\nA path P is friendly if there are two adjacent vertices x and y such that |NP (x)| \u2264 4, |NP (y)| \u2264\n3 and P is good in G \u2212 {x, y}. A path P meets a crossing if it contains at least one endvertex of\neach of the two crossed edges. A magic path is a friendly path meeting both crossings.\nClaim 9.5. G has no magic path Q.\nProof. Suppose for a contradiction that G has a magic path Q. Then there exists two adjacent\nvertices x and y such that |NQ (x)| \u2264 4, |NQ (y)| \u2264 3 and P is good in G \u2212 {x, y}. Lemma 8,\nthere in a L-colouring \u03c6 of Q such that every vertex z of (G \u2212 Q) \u2212 {x, y} satisfies |L\u03c6 (z)| \u2265 3.\nNow |L\u03c6 (x)| \u2265 1 and |L\u03c6 (y)| \u2265 2, because |NQ (x)| \u2264 4 and NQ (y) \u2264 3 Since Q meets the two\ncrossings, G \u2212 Q is planar. Furthermore, G \u2212 Q may be drawn in the plane such that all the\n9\n\n\fvertices on the outer face are those of N(Q). Hence L\u03c6 is a suitable assignment of G \u2212 Q. Hence\nby Theorem 2, G \u2212 Q is L\u03c6 -colourable and so G is L-colourable, a contradiction.\nIn the remaining of the proof, we shall prove that G contains a magic path, thus getting a\ncontradiction. Therefore, we consider shortest (C1 ,C2 )-paths, that are paths joining C1 and C2\nwith the smallest number of edges. We first consider the cases when the distance between C1\nand C2 is 0 or 1. We then deal with the general case when dist(C1,C2 ) \u2265 2.\nClaim 9.6. dist(C1,C2 ) > 0.\nProof. Assume for a contradiction that dist(C1,C2 ) = 0. Then, without loss of generality, v1 =\nv2 . Note that u1 6= u2 as otherwise the path u1 v1 would be magic, contradicting Claim 9.5.\nSimilarly, we have t1 6= t2.\nNote that w1 is not adjacent to u2 for otherwise both the interior and exterior of w1 u1 v1 u2\nwould contain at least one neighbour of u1 by Claim 9.1. Thus this 4-cycle would be nicely\nseparating, a contradiction to Claim 9.4. Henceforth, by symmetry, w1 is not adjacent to u2 nor\nt2 and w2 is not adjacent to u1 nor t1.\nIf u1 is not adjacent to u2 , then consider the induced path Q = u1 v1 u2 . Since w1 and w2 are\n/ The vertices t1 and t2cannot\nnot adjacent to u2 and u1 , respectively, then {w1 , w2 } \u2229 ZQ = 0.\nbe both in ZQ for otherwise u1t2 and u2t1 would cross. Furthermore, if z1 and z2 are distinct\nvertices in ZQ \\ {t1,t2}, then either u1 v1 u2 z1 nicely separates z2 or u1 v1 u2 z2 nicely separates z1\ncontradicting Claim 9.4. Thus, |ZQ | \u2264 2 and Q is magic contradicting Claim 9.5. Henceforth,\nu1 is adjacent to u2 , and, by a symmetrical argument, t1 is adjacent to t2 .\nIf u1 is adjacent to t2, then both the interior and exterior of u1 u2 w2t2 contain at least one\nneighbour of w2 by Claim 9.1. Thus this 4-cycle would be nicely separating, a contradiction to\nClaim 9.4. Henceforth, u1 is not adjacent to t2 , and symmetrically t1 is not adjacent to u2 .\nTherefore Q = u1 v1t2 is an induced path. Note that ZQ \u2286 N(v1 ). The triangles v1 u1 u2\nand v1t1t2 together with Claim 9.2 imply that N(v1 ) = {u1 , u2 ,t1,t2 , w1 , w2 }. Since w1 is not\nadjacent to t2 and w2 is not adjacent to u1 , then ZQ = {u2 ,t1}. Thus Q is magic contradicting\nClaim 9.5.\nClaim 9.7. Let i \u2208 {1, 2} and x a vertex not in Ci . Then at most one vertex in {ui ,ti } is adjacent\nto x and at most one vertex in {vi , wi } is adjacent to x.\nProof. Assume for a contradiction that x is adjacent to both ui and ti . Observe that the edges ui x\nand ti x are not crossed since dist(C1,C2 ) \u2265 1. Then one of the two 4-cycles ui vi ti x and ui witi x\nis nicely separating. Thus the region bounded by this cycle has no vertex by Claim 9.4. Hence\neither d(vi ) \u2264 4 or d(wi ) \u2264 4. This contradicts Claim 9.1.\nSimilarly, one shows that at most one vertex in {vi , wi } is adjacent to x.\nClaim 9.8. dist(C1,C2 ) > 1.\nProof. Assume for a contradiction that dist(C1,C2 ) = 1. Without loss of generality, we may\nassume that v1 v2 \u2208 E(G).\nLet us first show that without loss of generality, we may assume that u1 is not adjacent to v2\nand u2 is not adjacent to v1 . By symmetry, if t1 is not adjacent to v2 and t2 is not adjacent to v1 ,\nthen we get the result by renaming swapping the names of ui and ti , i = 1, 2. Thus by symmetry\nand by Claim 9.7, if it not the case, then u1 v2 \u2208 E(G) and v1t2 \u2208 E(G). Moreover w1 v2 is not\nan edge by Claim 9.7. Hence renaming u1 , v1 , t1 , w1 into v1 , t1 , w1 , u1 respectively, we are in\nthe desired configuration.\n\n10\n\n\fThe vertices u1 and u2 are not adjacent, for otherwise the cycle u1 v1 v2 u2 would be nicely\nseparating since G is triangulated and u1 v2 and u2 v1 are not edges. So Q is an induced path.\nA vertex of ZQ is goofy if it is adjacent to u1 and u2 .\n\u2022 Suppose first that there is a goofy vertex z\u2032 not in C1 \u222aC2 .\nWithout loss of generality, we may assume that z\u2032 is adjacent to u1 , v1 and u2 . If the\ncrossing C1 is inside z\u2032 u1 v1 , then consider the path R = t1 v1 v2 u2 . It is induced since\nz\u2032 u1 v1 separates t1 from v2 and u2 . Moreover all the neighbours of t1 are inside z\u2032 u1 v1 , so\nthey have at most two neighbours in R except for u1 which is not adjacent to v2 nor to u2 .\nHence the vertices of ZR are all adjacent to {v1 , v2 , u2 }. Moreover w2 \u2208\n/ ZR because w2 v1\nis not an edge by Claim 9.7. Hence by planarity of G \u2212 {w1 , w2 }, there are at most two\nvertices adjacent to {v1 , v2 , u2 }. Thus R is magic, a contradiction.\nHence we may assume that C1 is outside z\u2032 u1 v1 . The 4-cycle z\u2032 v1 v2 u2 is not nicely separating by Claim 9.4, and G is triangulated. So z\u2032 v2 \u2208 E(G) because v1 is not adjacent to\nu2 . So z\u2032 is adjacent to all vertices of Q.\nThen there is no other vertex z\u2032\u2032 in ZQ \\ {C1 \u222aC2 }, for otherwise one of the crossing Ci is\ninside ui vi z\u2032\u2032 and as above, we obtain the contradiction that R is magic.\nNow w1 u2 is not an edge, for otherwise w1 u1 z\u2032 u2 would be separating since d(u1 ) \u2265 5, a\ncontradiction to Claim 9.4. Similarly, w2 u1 is not an edge. Hence ZQ \u2282 {z\u2032 ,t1 ,t2}. Now\none of the edges t1u2 and t2u1 is not in E(G), since otherwise they would cross. Without\nloss of generality, t1 is not adjacent to u2 . Then Q is good in G \u2212 t2 , and so Q is magic.\nThis contradicts Claim 9.5.\n\u2022 Suppose now that all the goofy vertices of ZQ are in C1 \u222aC2 .\nSuppose first that w1 is in ZQ , then w1 u2 is an edge because w1 is not adjacent to v2\naccording to Claim 9.7. Thus t2 and w2 are not adjacent to u1 . So w2 \u2208\n/ ZQ and NQ (t2) \u2282\n{v1 , v2 , u2 }, so t2 is not goofy. Moreover by planarity of G \u2212{w1 , w2 }, there is at most two\nvertices adjacent {v1 , v2 , u2 }. Furthermore, all the vertices distinct from t1 and adjacent\nto {u1 , v1 , v2 } are in the region bounded by w1 v1 v2 u2 containing u1 . Therefore there is at\nmost one such vertex. Hence Q is good in G \u2212 {w1 ,t1 }. Thus Q is magic and contradicts\nClaim 9.5.\nSimilarly, we get a contradiction if w2 \u2208 ZQ . So ZQ \u2229 (C1 \u222aC2 ) \u2286 {t1,t2 }. Then easily Q\nis good in G \u2212 t2 and so Q is magic. This contradicts Claim 9.5.\n\nClaim 9.9. Some of the shortest (C1 ,C2 )-paths is nice.\nProof. Let P = x1 x2 * * * x p be any shortest (C1 ,C2 )-path. Then no vertex in C1 is adjacent to a\n/ Similarly, we have V (C2 ) \u2229 ZP = 0.\n/ Hence\nvertex in P \u2212 {x1 , x2 }. Therefore, V (C1 ) \u2229 ZP = 0.\n\u2032\nthe graph G induced by V (P) \u222aZP is planar as it contains exactly one vertex from each crossing.\nAny vertex not in P can be adjacent only to vertices of P at distance at most two from\neach other, otherwise there would be a (C1 ,C2 )-path shorter than P. Thus, if z \u2208 ZP , then z\nhas precisely three neighbours in P. Moreover, there exists an i \u2208 {2, . . . , p \u2212 1} such that\nNP (z) = [xi ].\nIf there are distinct vertices z1 , z2, z3 \u2208 ZP such that NP (z1 ) = NP (z2 ) = NP (z2 ) = [xi ] for\nsome value of i, then the subgraph of G\u2032 induced by {z1 , z2 , z3 } \u222a {xi\u22121 , xi , xi+1 } contains a\nK3,3 . By Kuratowski's Theorem, this contradicts the fact that G\u2032 is planar. Therefore, for every\n2 \u2264 i \u2264 p \u2212 1, there are at most two vertices in ZP adjacent to [xi ].\n11\n\n\fLet z1 , z2 \u2208 ZP be such that NP (z1) = NP (z2 ) = [xi ]. The edges of H = G[{z1 , z2 } \u222a [xi ]]\nseparate the plane into five regions R1 , . . . , R5 as follows. Let R1 be the region bounded by\nxi\u22121 xi z1 not containing the vertex z2 , R2 be the region bounded by xi xi+1 z1 not containing the\nvertex z2 , R3 be the region bounded by xi\u22121 xi z2 not containing the vertex z1 , R4 be the region\nbounded by xi xi+1 z2 not containing the vertex z1 and R5 be the region bounded by xi\u22121 z1 xi+1 z2\nnot containing xi (see Figure 1). Since (V (C1 ) \u222aV (C2 )) \u2229 ZP = 0/ and P is a shortest (C1 ,C2 )path, then no edge in H is crossed.\nz1\n\nR5\nR1\n\nR2\nxi\n\nxi\u22121\n\nR3\n\nxi+1\n\nR4\n\nz2\n\nFigure 1: Regions R1 , R2 , R3 , R4 and R5 .\n\nLet JP be the subset of {3, . . ., p \u2212 2} such that for j \u2208 JP , there are two vertices in ZP\nadjacent to [x j ] and at least one vertex adjacent to [x j\u22121 ] and another adjacent to [x j+1 ]. The\n/\npath P is said to be semi-nice if JP = 0.\nLet us first prove that some of the shortest (C1 ,C2 )-paths is semi-nice.\nSuppose for a contradiction that no shortest (C1 ,C2 )-path is semi-nice. Let P be a shortest\n(C1 ,C2 )-path that maximizes the smallest index i in JP . Let z1 , z2 \u2208 ZP be such that\nNP (z1 ) = NP (z2 ) = [xi ].\nLet z \u2208 ZP be a vertex adjacent to [xi+1 ]. If C2 is in R5 , then so is xi+2 and we get a\ncontradiction from the fact that either zxi or zxi+2 must cross an edge of H. Since P\ndefines a path between xi+1 and V (C2 ), then C2 must be either in R2 or in R4 (say R4 ).\nSimilarly, C1 is either in R1 or in R3 . The cycle xi\u22121 xi xi+1 z2 is not be a nicely separating\ncycle by Claim 9.4, so C1 must be in R1 . Now, by Claim 9.2, R2 and R3 are empty, and,\nby Claim 9.4, there is no vertex in R5 . Since P is a shortest path, xi\u22121 xi+1 is not an edge\nand therefore z1 is adjacent to z2 as G is triangulated.\nNow, consider the path P\u2032 obtained from P by replacing xi with x\u2032i = z2 . Note that P\u2032 is\nalso a shortest path and that both z1 and xi are adjacent to [x\u2032i ]. Since no edge in H is\ncrossed, for any v \u2208 V (G) \\ ({z1, z2 } \u222a [xi ]), if v is adjacent to xi\u22121 then it must be in R1\nand if v is adjacent to z2 then it must be in R4 . Therefore, there is no vertex in ZP\u2032 adjacent\nto {xi\u22122 , xi\u22121 , z2 }. This implies that if j \u2208 JP\u2032 , then either j \u2264 i \u2212 3 or j \u2265 i + 1. Note that\nif j \u2208 JP\u2032 and j \u2264 i \u2212 3, then j \u2208 JP . As i is the minimum of JP , the minimum of JP\u2032 is at\nleast i + 1. This contradicts our choice of P.\n\n12\n\n\fLet KP be the subset of {2, . . ., p \u2212 1} such that for k \u2208 KP , there are two vertices in ZP\nadjacent to [xk ] and two vertices adjacent to [xk+1 ]. Observe that a nice path P is a semi-nice\npath such that KP is empty, that is a path such that JP and KP are empty.\nSuppose, by way of contradiction, that every (C1 ,C2 )-shortest path is not nice. Then consider the semi-nice (C1 ,C2 )-shortest path that maximizes the minimum of KP .\nLet z1 , z2 , z3 , z4 \u2208 ZP be such that NP (z1 ) = NP (z2 ) = [xi ] and NP (z3 ) = NP (z4 ) = [xi+1 ],\nwhere i is the smallest index in KP . Recall that the edges of H = G[{z1, z2 } \u222a [xi ]] separate the\nplane into the five above-described regions R1 , . . ., R5 . Again, we can use z3 or z4 to prove that\nC2 is either in R2 or in R4 (say R4 ). Therefore, xi+2 is in R4 which implies z3 and z4 are also\nin R4 . Thus, z1 is not adjacent to z3 nor z4 . Furthermore, z2 cannot be adjacent to both z3 and\nz4 for otherwise we can obtain a K5 in the subgraph of G\u2032 induced by [xi+1 ] \u222a {z2 , z3 , z4} by\ncontracting the edge z4 xi+2 (see Figure 2). Thus, without loss of generality, suppose z2 and z3\nare not adjacent.\nz3\n\nxi\n\nxi+1\nxi+2\n\nz2\n\nz4\n\nFigure 2: K5 minor of G\u2032 is obtained by contracting z4 xi+2 .\nConsider the path P\u2032 obtained from P by replacing xi+1 with x\u2032i+1 = z3 . Since no edge in H\nis crossed, for any v \u2208 V (G) \\ ({z1, z2 } \u222a [xi ]), if v is adjacent to xi\u22121 then it is not in R4 , and if v\nis adjacent to z3 then it must be in R4 . Since neither z1 nor z2 are adjacent to z3 and xi+1 is not\nadjacent to xi\u22121 , there is no vertex in ZP\u2032 adjacent to {xi\u22121 , xi , z3 }. This implies that if k \u2208 KP\u2032 ,\nthen either k \u2264 i \u2212 2 or k \u2265 i + 1. Note that if k \u2208 KP\u2032 and k \u2264 i \u2212 2, then k \u2208 KP . This implies\nthat the minimum index in KP\u2032 is strictly greater than i. Hence by our choice of P, the path P\u2032 is\n/\nnot semi-nice, that is JP\u2032 6= 0.\nObserve that if j \u2208 JP\u2032 , then either j \u2264 i \u2212 2 or j \u2265 i + 2. Note that if j \u2208 JP\u2032 and either\nj \u2264 i \u2212 2 or j \u2265 i + 4, then j \u2208 JP . Since JP is empty, then JP\u2032 \u2286 {i + 2, i + 3}. Let z\u20321 , z\u20322 \u2208 ZP\u2032 be\nsuch that NP\u2032 (z\u20321 ) = NP\u2032 (z\u20322 ) = [x\u2032j ], for some j \u2208 JP\u2032 with JP\u2032 \u2286 {i + 2, i + 3}. Note that for the\ntwo possible values of j, both z\u20321 and z\u20322 are adjacent to xi+3 . Since P is a shortest (C1 ,C2 )-path,\nneither z2 nor xi+1 are adjacent to xi+3 and therefore z\u20321 and z\u20322 are in R4 . Let R\u20321 be the region\nbounded by x\u2032j\u22121 x\u2032j z\u20321 not containing the vertex z\u20322 and R\u20323 be the region bounded by x\u2032j\u22121 x\u2032j z\u20322 not\ncontaining the vertex z\u20321 . Both of these regions are contained in R4 . With the same argument\nused above in the proof of existence of a semi-nice path, one shows that if j \u2208 JP\u2032 , then C1 is\neither contained in R\u20321 or in R\u20323 . We get a contradiction as the path P from V (C1 ) to xi\u22121 crosses\nan edge of H.\nClaim 9.10. There exists an induced path Q = x0 x1 * * * x p x p+1 with the following properties:\n13\n\n\fP1 . P = x1 * * * x p is a shortest (C1 ,C2 )-path and is a nice path;\nP2 . x0 \u2208 V (C1 ) and x p+1 \u2208 V (C2 ) but x0 x1 and x p x p+1 are not crossed edges; and\nP3 . there is at most one vertex in ZQ adjacent to both vertices in {x0 , x3 } and at most one\nvertex in ZQ adjacent to both vertices in {x p\u22122 , x p+1 }.\nP4 . for any i < j, if there are two vertices adjacent to [vi ] and two vertices adjacent to [v j ],\nthen the number of vertices adjacent to [vi+1 ] or to [v j\u22121 ] is at most 1.\nProof. By Claim 9.9 there exists a shortest (C1 ,C2 )-path P = x1 * * * x p which is nice. Without\nloss of generality, we may assume that x1 = v1 and x p = v2 . According to Claim 9.7, we can\nchoose vertices x0 \u2208 {u1 ,t1} and x p+1 \u2208 {u2 ,t2} such that Q is induced. Therefore, we have at\nleast one path satisfying properties P1 and P2 . We say that x0 is a valid endpoint if there is at\nmost one vertex in ZQ adjacent to both vertices in {x0 , x3 } and x p+1 is a valid endpoint if there\nis at most one vertex in ZQ adjacent to both vertices in {x p\u22122 , x p+1 }.\nLet Q be a path satisfying properties P1 and P2 which maximizes the number of valid endpoints of Q.\nLet us first show that Q has only valid endpoints, and satisfies property P4 . By contradiction,\nsuppose that Q has an invalid endpoint. Without loss of generality, x0 is invalid.\nLet z1 , z2 \u2208 ZQ be two vertices adjacent to both vertices in {x0 , x3 }. Since P is a shortest\n(C1 ,C2 )-path, no vertex of C1 is adjacent to x3 . Therefore, no edge of x0 x1 x2 x3 z1 and x0 x1 x2 x3 z2\nis crossed. Let R1 be the region bounded by x0 x1 x2 x3 z1 that does not contain z2 and R2 be the\nregion bounded by x0 x1 x2 x3 z2 that does not contain z1 . Since the edges bounding the regions\nR1 and R2 are not crossed, then the crossing C1 is contained in one of the regions R1 or R2 (say\nR1 ). Let x\u03020 be the vertex of {u1 ,t1} \\ {x0 } (see Figure 3).\nz1\n\nx\u03020\n\nR1\nx0\n\nx1\n\nx2\n\nx3\n\nR2\n\nz2\n\nFigure 3: Regions R1 and R2 and the vertex x\u03020 .\nAssume first that x\u03020 is not adjacent to x2 . Let Q\u0302 be the path obtained from Q by replacing\nx0 with x\u03020 . Clearly the path Q\u0302 is induced and satisfies properties P1 and P2 . By definition of Q,\nx\u03020 must be an invalid endpoint. Hence, there is a vertex \u1e91 in ZQ\u0302 \\ {z1 } which is adjacent to x\u03020\nand x3 . This vertex in necessarily inside R1 because it is adjacent to x0 . But then, by planarity,\nz1 cannot be adjacent to x1 and x2 , a contradiction to z1 \u2208 ZQ .\nAssume now that x\u03020 is adjacent to x2 . Let Q\u2032 be the path obtained from Q by replacing x0\nwith w1 and x1 with x\u03020 . Note that Q\u2032 is induced as w1 is not adjacent to x2 by Claim 9.7.\n14\n\n\fNote that property P2 is valid for Q\u2032 . The path P\u2032 = x\u03020 x2 * * * x p is a (C1 ,C2 ) shortest path.\nLet us prove that P\u2032 is nice and so that P\u2032 satisfies property P1 . If p = 3, then, since no vertex in\nthe cluster of C1 is adjacent to x3 , at most two vertices are in ZP\u2032 for otherwise we would get a\nK3,3 in G \u2212 {w1 , w2 }, which is impossible as this graph is planar. Thus P\u2032 is nice. Suppose now\nthat p \u2265 4. By planarity, z1 is not adjacent to x1 , so z1 is adjacent to x2 as z1 \u2208 ZQ . In addition,\nz1 x2 is contained in R1 . Thus, any vertex in ZP\u2032 adjacent to x\u03020 must be in region R1 and cannot\nbe adjacent to x3 . Hence no vertex is adjacent to [x2 ]P\u2032 so, since P is a nice path, P\u2032 is also a nice\npath.\nBy definition of Q, w1 must be an invalid endpoint of Q\u2032 . Hence, there is a vertex z\u2032 in\nZQ\u2032 \\ {z1 } which is adjacent to w1 and x3 . This vertex in necessarily inside R1 because neither\nx0 nor x1 are adjacent to x3 . But then, by planarity, z1 cannot be adjacent to x1 and x2 , a\ncontradiction to z1 \u2208 ZQ .\nLet us now prove that Q satisfies property P4 . By contradiction, suppose Q does not. Let\nz1 , z2 , z\u20321 , z\u20322 \u2208 ZQ be such that both z1 and z2 are adjacent to [xi ] and z\u20321 and z\u20322 are adjacent to\n[x j ]. Consider the regions R1 , . . . , R5 related to z1 and z2 used in Figure 1. Consider the regions\nR\u20321 , . . . , R\u20325 related to z\u20321 and z\u20322 used in Figure 1 for i = j.\nLet z \u2208 ZQ be adjacent to [xi+1 ]. Note that we can have {z1 , z2 } \u2229 {u1 ,t1} =\n6 0/ if i = 1. But\nsince dist(C1,C2 ) \u2265 2, the edges z1 xi+1 and z2 xi+1 are not crossed. Furthermore, since no vertex\nin the cluster of C1 is adjacent to x3 and not vertex in the cluster of C2 is adjacent to x1 (P is a\nshortest (C1 ,C2 )-path), then z is not in the cluster of either crossing.\nTherefore, since z is adjacent to both xi and xi+2 , we must have that both z and x3 are in R2 or\nin R4 (say R2 ). This also implies that C2 is in R2 . Note also that, by our choice of x0 , the edges\nz1 xi and z2 xi are not crossed. Therefore, C1 is contained in R1 \u222a R3 \u222a R5 . With a symmetric\nargument, we have that C1 is either in R\u20321 or in R\u20323 (say R1 ). Since both z\u20321 and z\u20322 are also in R2 ,\nthen R\u20321 \u222a R\u20323 are contained in R2 and we get a contradiction.\nLet Q be a path given by Claim 9.10. Without loss of generality, suppose x1 = v1 and\nx p = v2 . Note also that Claim 9.7 implies w1 and w2 are not in ZQ and therefore G[V (Q) \u222a ZQ ]\nis planar.\nClaim 9.11. dist(C1,C2 ) = 2 and there is a vertex adjacent to x0 and x4 .\nProof. Suppose not. Then no vertex in ZQ is adjacent to vertices at distance at least four in Q.\nObserve that this is the case when dist(C1,C2 ) \u2265 3, since x1 . . . x p is a shortest (C1 ,C2 )-path.\nSince P is a nice and shortest (C1 ,C2 )-path, then the only vertices in ZQ adjacent to vertices\nat distance at least three in Q must be adjacent to both x0 and x3 or to both x p\u22122 and x p+1 . By\nthe property P3 of Claim 9.10, there is at most one vertex, say z, adjacent to x0 and x3 and at\nmost one vertex, say z\u2032 , adjacent to x p\u22122 and x p+1 .\nLet us make few observations.\nObs. 1 If two vertices z1 and z2 distinct from z are adjacent to [x2 ], then no vertex is adjacent to\n[x1 ] and NQ (z) = {x0 , x1 , x3 }. Indeed z must be in the region R5 in Figure 1 because it\nis adjacent to x0 and x3 . By the planarity of G[V (Q) \u222a ZQ ] and since z is adjacent to x0 ,\nx0 must also be in R5 . Again by planarity, z is not adjacent to x2 and, therefore, must be\nadjacent to x1 as z \u2208 ZQ .\nObs. 2 If two vertices z1 and z2 distinct from z are adjacent to [x1 ], then no vertex is adjacent to\n[x2 ] and NQ (z) = {x0 , x2 , x3 }. This argument is symmetric to Observation 1.\nSuppose that z exists.\nIf exists, by Observations 1 and 2 (and their analog for z\u2032 ) and the properties of Q from\nz\u2032\n\n15\n\n\fClaim 9.10, the path Q is good in G \u2212 z\u2032 because it is great in G \u2212 {z, z\u2032 }. Hence Q is magic, a\ncontradiction to Claim 9.5. Hence z\u2032 does not exists.\nBy Claim 9.7, w2 is not adjacent to x p\u22121 and w1 is not adjacent to x p since dist(C1,C2 ) \u2265 2.\nSo, by planarity of G \u2212 {w1 , w2 }, at most two vertices are adjacent to [x p ]. Let y be a vertex\nadjacent to [x p ]. The path Q is not great in G \u2212 {y, z}, for otherwise it would be magic. Hence,\naccording to the properties of Q and the above observations, there must be two vertices adjacent\nto [x p ], two vertices adjacent to [x p\u22121 ] and one vertex adjacent to [x p\u22122 ]. Let z1 and z2 be the\ntwo vertices adjacent to [x p\u22121 ] and R1 . . . R5 be the regions as in Figure 1 with i = p \u2212 1. Since\nthere is a vertex adjacent to [x p\u22122 ], then C1 is in R1 or R3 , and C2 is in R2 or R4 because a\nvertex is adjacent to [x p ]. But by Claim 9.4 the 4-cycle z1 x p z2 x p\u22122 is not nicely separating, so\nthere is no vertex inside R5 . Since G is triangulated, and x p\u22122 x p is not an edge because P is a\nshortest (C1 ,C2 )-path, z1 z2 \u2208 E(G). Now the path Q is good in G \u2212 {z1 , z2 } and so is magic.\nThis contradicts Claim 9.5.\nHence we may assume that z does not exists and by symmetry that z\u2032 does not exist. We get\na contradiction similarly by considering a vertex w adjacent to [x1 ] in place of z.\nClaim 9.12. There is precisely one vertex z \u2208 ZQ adjacent to both x0 and x4 .\nProof. Observe that there are at most two vertices adjacent to x0 and x4 . Indeed such vertices\ncannot be in the crossings because dist(C1,C2 ) = 2. Thus if there were three such vertices,\ntogether with contracting the path x1 x2 x3 we would get K3,3 minor in G \u2212 {w1 , w2 }, a contradiction.\nSuppose by contradiction that two distinct vertices z1 , z2 \u2208 ZQ adjacent to vertices x0 and x4 .\nThe edges of Q are contained in the same region of the plane bounded by the cycle x0 z1 x4 z2 .\nTherefore, both crossings are also in the region containing the edges of Q. By Claim 9.3, the\nregion bounded by the cycle x0 z1 x4 z2 that does not contain the crossings has no vertex in its\ninterior. Since G is triangulated, z1 z2 \u2208 E(G) as x0 because x4 are not adjacent as dist(C1,C2 ) =\n2.\nBy the property P3 of Claim 9.10, z1 and z2 cannot be both adjacent to the five vertices in\nQ. Therefore, without loss of generality, suppose |NQ (z2 )| \u2264 4. Let us prove that Q is great in\nH = (G \u2212 z2 ) \\ {z1x0 , z1 x4 }.\n(i) If a vertex t in G \u2212 {z1 , z2 } is adjacent to at least four vertices of Q, then without loss\nof generality it is adjacent to {x0 , x1 , x2 , x3 } as it cannot be adjacent to x0 and x4 . Now\nby property P3 , z1 and z2 are not adjacent to x3 . Hence one of them (the one such that\nx0 x1 x2 x3 x4 zi separates t from z3\u2212i ) cannot be adjacent to any vertex of {x1 , x2 , x3 }, a\ncontradiction to the fact that it is in ZQ . Hence Q satisfies (a) in H.\n(ii) If two vertices t1 and t2 of H are adjacent to [x2 ], then necessarily x1t1x2t2 is a nicely\nseparating, a contradiction to Claim 9.4. Hence there is at most one vertex of H adjacent\nto [x2 ]. Thus Q satisfies (b) in H.\n(iii) If two vertices r1 and r2 of H are adjacent to [x1 ], then no vertex is adjacent to [x2 ].\nIndeed suppose for a contradiction that a vertex t is adjacent to [v2 ] none of {r1 , r2 ,t} is\nin {w1 , w2 } by Claim 9.7 and because dist(C1,C2 ) \u2265 2. Now contracting the path tx3 x4 z2\ninto a vertex w, we obtain a K3,3 with parts {r1 , r2 , w} and {x0 , x1 , x2 }. This contradicts\nthe planarity of G.\nSymmetrically, if two vertices of H are adjacent to [x3 ], then no vertex is adjacent to [x2 ].\nTherefore Q satisfies (c) in H.\n\n16\n\n\fIt follows that Q is a good path in H \u2032 = (G \u2212 z2 ) \\ z1x4 . Let \u03c6 be a safe L-colouring of Q\nin H \u2032 obtained by Lemma 8. Since Q meets the two crossings, G \u2212 Q is planar. Furthermore,\nG \u2212 Q can be drawn in the plane such that all vertices on the outer face are those in N(Q). Every\nvertex of ZQ \\ {z1 , z2 } is safe in H \u2032 and so in G, so |L\u03c6 (v)| \u2265 3. In H \u2032 , z1 is safe and in G, z1 has\none more neighbour in Q in G than H \u2032 , namely x4 . Thus in G, |L\u03c6 (z1 )| \u2265 2 because z1 was safe\nin H \u2032 . Since z2 has at most four neighbours in Q, we have |L\u03c6 (z2 )| \u2265 1. Now z1 is adjacent to z2 ,\nso L\u03c6 is a {z1 , z2 }-suitable assignment for G \u2212 Q. Hence by Theorem 2, G \u2212 Q is L\u03c6 -colourable\nand so G is L-colourable, a contradiction.\n\u2022 Assume first that |NQ (z)| = 5. Let H = G \\ {zx0 , zx4 }. z is the unique vertex adjacent to\nx0 and x4 . Moreover by property P3 z is the unique vertex adjacent to x0 and x3 and the\nunique one adjacent to x1 and x4 . Hence Q satisfies (a) in H. Moreover, for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 3,\nthere is at most one vertex distinct form z adjacent to [xi ] otherwise G[V (Q) \u222a ZQ ] would\ncontain a K3,3 . Hence Q also satisfies (b) and (c) in H. Therefore Q is great in H. By\nLemma 7, there exists a safe L-colouring \u03c6 of Q in H. Thus in G, every vertex in ZQ \\ {z}\nsatisfies |L\u03c6 (v)| \u2265 3 while |L\u03c6 (z)| \u2265 1. Hence L\u03c6 is suitable for G \u2212 Q. Therefore, by\nTheorem 2, G \u2212 Q is L\u03c6 -colourable and so G is L-colourable, a contradiction.\n\u2022 Assume now that |NQ (z)| \u2264 4.\nSuppose that there are two distinct vertices z1 , z2 \u2208 ZQ with z1 adjacent to x0 and x3 and z2\nadjacent to x1 and x4 . Let R1 be the region bounded by the cycle x0 x1 x2 x3 z1 not containing\nz2 and R2 be the region bounded by the cycle x1 x2 x3 x4 z2 not containing z1 (see Figure 4).\nNow, note that any vertex adjacent to both x0 and x4 is not in R1 \u222a R2 and any vertex\nadjacent to x2 must be in R1 \u222a R2 . Therefore, z \u2208 {z1 , z2 }. Indeed if this was not true, then\nby property P3 z is not adjacent to x1 nor x3 . Thus z must be adjacent to x2 as it is in ZQ .\nSo z is inside R1 \u222a R2 , which contradicts the fact that it is adjacent to x0 and x4 .\nz1\n\nR1\nx0\n\nx1\n\nx2\n\nx3\n\nx4\n\nR2\n\nz2\n\nFigure 4: Regions R1 and R2 .\n\nThus, at most one other vertex z\u2032 in ZQ \\ {z} is adjacent to vertices at distance three in\nQ. By symmetry, we may assume that z\u2032 is adjacent to x0 and x3 . Hence all vertices in\nZQ \\ {z, z\u2032 } are adjacent to some [xi ] for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 3. Similarly to (ii) and (iii) in Claim 9.12,\n17\n\n\fone shows that Q also satisfies (a) and (b) in (G \u2212 z) \\ z\u2032 x0 . Hence Q is a good path in\nG \u2212 z. Then Q is magic, a contradiction to Claim 9.5.\n\nAcknowledgement\nThe authors would like to thank Claudia Linhares Sales for stimulating discussions.\n\nReferences\n[1] M. O. Albertson.
