However since the effect of individual neutrinos is small it is cosmological observations, that\nobserve the cumulative effect of neutrinos on large\nscales, that present the most powerful way to bound\nthe absolute neutrino mass scale. Albeit indirect and\nmodel dependent, cosmological constraints are currently stronger than those coming from beta-decay\nexperiments (for recent reviews see [1] and [2]). For\nexample, the Mainz [3] and Troitsk [4] Tritium decay\nexperiments give upper limits on the single electron\nneutrino mass of m < 2.05eV and m < 2.3eV respectively, at 95%c.l.. Cosmological data coming from\nCosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements\nfrom WMAP [5] experiment combined with baryonic\noscillation data [6] and various Supernovae observations ([7], [8]) lower this limit to m <\n\u223c 0.22eV [9]. On\nthe other hand observations of flavour oscillations in\natmospheric and solar neutrinos provide evidence not\nonly for a non-zero neutrino mass, but also for a difference between masses, measuring squared mass differences of [10]:\n\u22123\n|\u2206m231 | = |m23 \u2212 m21 | = 2.2+1.1\neV2\n\u22120.8 * 10\n\n\u22125\n\u2206m221 = m22 \u2212 m21 = 7.9+1.0\neV2\n\u22120.8 * 10\n\n(1)\n\nwhere ranges indicated are 3\u03c3 confidence level and\nm1 , m2 and m3 are the three mass eigenstates. The\nambiguity in the sign of \u2206m231 leads to an uncertainty\nabout the neutrino mass scheme, allowing for two possible hierarchies: the normal hierarchy, given by the\nscheme m3 \u226b m2 > m1 , or the inverted hierarchy\nm2 > m1 \u226b m3 . Note that given equation (1) an inverted hierarchy scenario would bePautomatically excluded by measuring a total mass\nm\u03bd <\n\u223c 0.1eV.\n\nIt is commonly perceived that cosmology\nis able to\nP\nconstrain the total neutrino mass\nm\u03bd while mass\ndifferences between eigenstates can be neglected. This\nis an excellent approximation as shown in [11] at least\nfor the CMB anisotropies power spectrum, since the\neffect of neutrino mass on the CMB is related to the\nphysical density\nP of massive neutrinos \u03c9\u03bd , i.e. to their\ntotal mass\nm\u03bd . Individual neutrino masses do have\nan effect on the matter power spectrum, due to the\ndifferent transition redshifts from relativistic to nonrelativistic behaviour. This effect is still much smaller\nthan that due to the total mass and can be safely neglected in analysing current cosmological data. Nevertheless in the near future various experiments will\nreach a much higher accuracy in reconstructing the\nmatter power spectrum. It is therefore timely to consider the possibility that these surveys will be sensitive\nto single neutrino masses. In recent papers (see for example [12] and [13]) a forecast has been made considering future observations of CMB anisotropies, CMB\nlensing and galaxy distribution finding that this kind\nof data doesn't seem able to reach enough accuracy to\ndiscriminate between the two hierarchies. In [14] has\nbeen shown that future accurate measurements of the\nredshifted 21 cm signal from the epoch of reionization\ncan in principle measure individual masses but will\nbe very difficult to achieve the precision required to\ndistinguish normal and inverted hierarchies.\nIn [15] an explicit and more general parameterization of neutrino mass splitting was introduced, representing various possible hierarchies; with the only\nsimplifying approximation that two neutrinos are of\nthe same mass m1 = m2 . This approximation is\nwell justified by equation (1). In [15] it was shown\nthat even a cosmic variance limited CMB experiment\nwould not be able to detect a difference in individual\nneutrino masses. In addition CMB lensing, even if\nlimited by cosmic variance only, is strongly inhibited\n\n\f2\nin measuring the mass hierarchy by degeneracies with\nother cosmological parameters.\nIn this article we use a Fisher matrix formalism applied to the same parameterization of [15] to assess the\nability of future cosmic shear measurements, like those\nachievable with Euclid/DUNE [16] experiment, combined with Planck [17] CMB data to place constraints\non single neutrino masses. It is almost a decade that\ncosmic shear has been recognized as one of the most\npowerful tools to constrain the total neutrino mass\n(see for example [18], [19] and[20]) and hence an investigation into how far these experiments can proceed\nin the exploration of the neutrino properties is well\njustified.\nThe article is organized as follows: in section II we\nreview in more detail the effects of the total neutrino\nmass and of individual neutrino masses on cosmological observables. We also describe the parameterization of [15] which will be used throughout the rest of\nthe article. In section III we describe the implementaton of our cosmic shear and CMB Fisher matrices.\nSection IV shows results from our forecasts as function of various assumptions about the neutrino mass\nhierarchy, and for different parameter sets. We also\ndiscuss results in the light of our parameterization of\nthe neutrino mass hierarchy. Our forecasts show that\naccurate measurements of the matter power spectrum\nfrom Euclid, combined with CMB data from Planck,\ncan reach the accuracy required to constrain single\nneutrino masses. In section V we conduct a more accurate analysis of our results through a Bayesian evidence investigation. We also show that assuming a\nwrong hierarchy can lead to a bias in the recovered\nvalue of other cosmological parameters, in particular\nfor the dark energy equation of state, generally comparable with the 1\u03c3 sensitivity. The largest bias is\nfound in the total\nP neutrino mass, due to the degeneracy involving\nm\u03bd and the hierarchy parameter, at\n2.3\u03c3. Finally, in section VI we summarize our conlusions.\n\nII.\n\nEFFECTS OF NEUTRINO MASS\nSPLITTING\n\nThe main effect of a non-zero neutrino mass on\ncosmology is through the collisionless fluid behaviour\nthat causes neutrinos to free-stream over a typical\nlength which is known as free-streaming length \u03bbF S .\nThe consequence of this free propagation is a cancellation of neutrino density fluctuations on scales\nsmaller than \u03bbF S and a slow-down in the growth\nof perturbation on these scales. The matter power\nspectrum results are then damped for wave vectors\nk>\n\u223c kF S \u2243 2\u03c0/\u03bbF S . The free streaming wave vector\nof a single species kF S depends on the mass of that\n\nspecies ([22])\nq\n\n2\n3 [\u03a9m (1\n\n+ z)3 + \u03a9\u039b ] \u0010 m \u0011\nhM pc\u22121 ,\n(1 + z)2\n1eV\n(2)\nwhere h = H0 /(100km s\u22121 M pc\u22121 ). On these small\nscales the matter power spectrum is suppressed with\nrespect to the power spectrum of a cosmology with\nmassless neutrinos by an amount that depends mainly\non the fraction f\u03bd of matter density in the form of\nmassive neutrinos (f\u03bd \u2261 \u03a9\u03bd /\u03a9m ). In the case of degenerate masses \u03a9\u03bd can be expressed as a function of\nthe total neutrino mass:\nP\nm\u03bd\n\u03a9\u03bd \u2243\n.\n93.14h2eV\nkF S (z) =\n\nHowever, as pointed out in [22], even in the case of\nnon-degenerate masses this relation remains a good\napproximation.\nMassive neutrinos become non-relativistic at a redshift given by znr \u223c 2 * 103 m\u03bd /eV, so that neutrinos\nwith masses up to \u223c 0.5eV are still relativistic at time\nof recombination. As a result the effect of neutrino\nfree streaming on the CMB power spectrum is negligible for small neutrino masses. In this case the main\neffect of neutrino masses on the CMB is indirect, related to the delay of matter-radiation equality. This\ncauses a small shift in the peaks of the power spectrum and a slight increase of their heights due to a\nlonger duration of the Sachs-Wolfe effect.\nFrom this discussion is clear that neutrino mass\naffects growth of structure in two ways: the matter\npower spectrum is suppressed byP\nan amount that depends mainly on the total mass\nm\u03bd but also, even\nif for a minor amount, on single masses, because the\ntime of transition to non-relativistic regime depends\non single masses. The typical wave vector over which\nthis suppression can be observed also depends on the\nmass of single neutrino species as shown by equation\n(2). Therefore a reconstruction of the matter power\nspectrum\ncan in principle give information both on\nP\nm\u03bd and on single masses (through the suppression\nof the power spectrum and kF S ), even if this second\neffect is generally much smaller than that due to the\ntotal mass. In the following sections we investigate the\nability of future cosmological experiments to reach the\nsensitivity required to detect differences in neutrino\nmasses. Following [15] we parameterize mass splitting\nby introducing the parameter \u03b1 defined as the fraction\nof the total mass in the third neutrino mass eigenstate:\nX\nm3 = \u03b1\nm\u03bd .\n(3)\nThe other two eigenstates are assumed to share the\nsame mass m1 = m2 . This approximation is supported by the observed differences in the squares of\nneutrino masses as measured by oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos, |\u2206m223 |/\u2206m212 \u2243 0.5*10\u22122 [10]. The\nadvantage of this parameterization is that it allows us\n\n\f3\nto represent in a simple way various mass hierarchies\nsuch as total degeneracy (\u03b1 = 1/3) and normal or\ninverted hierarchy given respectively by \u03b1 \u223c 1 and\n\u03b1 \u226a 1.\n\nThe Fisher matrix for weak lensing is given by (e.g.\n[24])\nX (2l + 1)\u2206l \u2202Pij\n\nWL\nF\u03b1\u03b2\n= fsky\n\n2\n\nl\n\nIII.\n\nFORECAST FOR WEAK LENSING\nTOMOGRAPHY\n\nWeak lensing (see [27] for a recent review or\nhttp://www.gravitationallensing.net) is a particularly powerful probe of cosmology since it simultaneously measures the growth of structure through\nthe matter power spectrum, and the geometry of the\nUniverse through the lensing effect. Since weak lensing probes the dark matter power spectrum directly\nit is not limited by assumptions about galaxy bias\n(how galaxies are clustered with respect to the dark\nmatter). Future weak lensing surveys will measure\nphotometric redshifts of billions of galaxies allowing the possibility of 3D weak lensing analysis (e.g.\n[32, 33, 34, 35]) or a tomographic reconstruction of\ngrowth of structures as a function of time through a\nbinning of the redshift distribution of galaxies D(z),\nwith a considerable gain of cosmological information\n(e.g. on neutrinos [19]; dark energy [35]; the growth\nof structure [37, 38] and map the dark matter distribution as a function of redshift [39]).\nIn this section we present forecasts for the upcoming weak lensing survey Euclid [16], combined with\nconstraints expected from the CMB Planck experiment [17] using a Fisher matrix formalism. We first\nexplored a simple 8-parameter model with fiducial values \u03a9b h2 = 0.022, \u03a9c h2 = 0.111,\nP h = 0.7, \u03c4 = 0.084,\nns = 0.95, As = 2.48 * 10\u22129 ,\nm\u03bd = 0.055eV and\nthe hierarchy parameter \u03b1 = 0.95. Note that we are\nassuming a fiducial normal hierarchy scheme for neutrino masses. We then repeated the analysis for a\nlarger set of parameters, including running of spectral index (with target value dns /d ln k = 0) and the\ndark energy equation of state w (assuming cosmological constant w = \u22121 as the fiducial model), to study\nhow degeneracies with various parameters affect constraints on neutrino mass hierarchy.\nTo calculate the power spectra we used the numerical code CAMB [23] that can calculate CMB and matter power spectra, also for non-degenerate neutrino\nmasses. The usual definition of the Fisher matrix [30]\nis:\n\u001c\n\u001d\n\u2202 2 ln L\nF\u03b1\u03b2 \u2261 \u2212\n(4)\n\u2202p\u03b1 \u2202p\u03b2\nwhere L is the likelihood function for a set of parameters pi .

We treat this uncertainty following the approach of [26] where a galaxy with redshift z could be wrongly observed at a redshift zph .\nLetting p(z|zph ) be the probability that this happens\nthe distribution of galaxies in the ith bin is modified to take\nR into account this 'leakage' between bins\nDi (z) = zph,i dzph D(z)p(z|zph ).

The 1\u03c3 uncertainties on the sum of masses is \u03c3P m\u03bd = 0.037eV,\nwhich is in agreement with other forecasts (see for example [20]) and confirms the ability of these surveys\nto detect neutrino mass. In particular this work has\na resonance with Debono et al. (2009) (in preparation) in which the effect of parameter sets on neutrino\nmass constraints are investigated. We find that for\nthe parameters that are common between the two articles there is agreement between the predicted errors,\ndespite the slightly different parameter sets, power\nspestrum estimation approaches (CAMB vs Eisenstein & Hu code [21]) and assumptions.\nAs one can see for a typical normal hierarchy scenario with \u03b1 = 0.95 the combination Euclid+Planck\ncan reach a \u223c 20% sensitivity on \u03b1 with an error\n\u03c3\u03b1 = 0.19. For this normal hierarchy scenario we\nhave repeated the Fisher matrix calculation using a\nlarger parameter space, including running dns /d ln k\nof the spectral index and the dark energy equation of\nstate parameter w, to check the weakening in the constraints on \u03b1 induced by degeneracies among these\nparameters. One may expect that running and w\nwould have a large degeneracy with neutrino mass\nsince they both can add an effective damping on small\nscale. However, as shown in in Table II and in Fig. 1,\n\nFIG. 1: 68% and 95%Pprobability contours (twoparameter) in the plane \u03b1- m\u03bd for Planck+Euclid from\nour Fisher matrix calculation for the 10-parameter space\ndescribed in the text.\n\nB.\n\nParameterisation Investigation\n\nFor the smaller 8-parameter set we repeated the\nFisher matrix calculation for different fiducial values\nfor \u03b1. In Fig. 2 we show the relative uncertainties in \u03b1 from the combination Euclid+Planck as a\nfunction of the target model. The figure is a combination of a general trend, that causes the uncertainty on \u03b1 to decrease for \u03b1 increasing, and the way\nin which constraints from CMB combine with those\nfrom weak lensing. The loss of sensitivity around\n\u03b1 \u2243 0.88 is in fact due toPa strong rotation of the\ndegeneracy in the plane \u03b1- m\u03bd in the Euclid Fisher\nmatrix, as shown in Fig. 3, from an anti-correlation\nto a positive correlation. For the Planck Fisher matrix instead the degeneracy between these two parameters is less dependent on the fiducial value of \u03b1. As\none can see for \u03b1 \u2243 0.88 the constraints from Euclid\nare almost independent of \u03b1, and the combination\nof the two experiments lose the ability to break the\ndegeneracy between these parameters. This is confirmed also by the fact that the only other parameter\n\n\f5\nthat shows a significant peak of uncertainty\nP in correspondence of \u03b1 \u2243 0.88 is the total mass\nm\u03bd itself\nthat icrease from \u03c3P m\u03bd \u2243 0.025eV for \u03b1 = 0.86 to\n\u03c3P m\u03bd \u2243 0.034eV for \u03b1 = 0.88.\nWe emphasise that this is a peculiar effect of this\nparameterisation, we have tested the derivative numerically for convergence. Therefore we advocate this\nparameterisation but with a strong warning that results are highly dependant on the fiducial value of \u03b1,\nparticularly around \u03b1 \u2248 0.88.\nWe note however that the general\nP decrease in \u03c3\u03b1 /\u03b1\nis quite intuitive since for m3 \u2243\nm\u03bd a variation in\n\u03b1 means a variation only in the mass that can have\nan effect on the growth of structure. In this limit the\nothers two eigenstates have a very low mass and are\nrelativistic up to a very\nP low redshift. For example for\nour target model ( m\u03bd \u2243 0.055eV and \u03b1 = 0.95)\nthe two eigenstates have m1 = m2 \u2243 1.4 * 10\u22123 eV,\nthis results in the neutrinos being relativisitc up to a\nredshift z \u223c 2. Hence for \u03b1 \u2192 1 the sensitivity to\nthis parameter increases. Conversely when \u03b1 is significantly different from 1, for example in the case of\ntotal degeneracy, when \u03b1 = 1/3, a variation in \u03b1 and\nhence in m3 implies an opposite variation in m1 and\nm2 which now have a non-negligible mass. These variations partially compensate reducing the sensitivity of\ncosmology to \u03b1.\nThis reasoning is confirmed by the comparison between derivatives of the matter power spectrum P (k)\n(that enters in the calculation of the weak lensing convergence power spectrum) with respect to \u03b1 calculated\nfor different values of \u03b1. In Fig. 4 are shown derivatives dP/d\u03b1 for the case \u03b1 = 0.95 and \u03b1 = 1/3. The\nlatter is about two orders of magnitude smaller than\nthe first. As one can see the two derivatives have opposite signs due to the different change in kF S induced\nby a change in \u03b1 in the two target models. When\n\u03b1 \u2192 1 an increase in \u03b1 causes an increase in kF S according to equation (2) while, as we have said above,\nm1 and m2 are not important. Instead, for \u03b1 = 1/3 an\nincrease in this parameter causes a decrease of m1 and\nm2 (which now cannot be neglected) and the overall\neffect is a decrease in kF S .\n\nV.\n\nFIG. 2: relative error on \u03b1 as a function of the target\nmodel for the combinationPPlanck+Euclid.

Calculation of Bayesian\nevidence allows one to make a comparison of different\nmodels, as opposed to parameter estimation within a\nmodel.

The inner part of the plot (from the\ninnermost ln B = 1 contour) corresponds to values B > 1\nand hence evidence for the simpler model (see text). The\ncross indicates the assumption of degenerate masses fixing\nthe total mass to the correct value; the square indicates a\ntypical inverted hierarchy scenario.\n\ntable exceptions include the dark energy equation of\nstate parameter. Assuming total degeneracy of neutrino masses, the shift on w is smaller than 1\u03c3 but\nbecomes slightly greater assuming an inverted hierarchy. Our Fisher matrix analysisP\nindicates that this\nis due essentially P\nto the shift in\nm\u03bd and hence to\nthe degeneracy w- m\u03bd because there is no significant\ncorrelation between w and \u03b1.\nWe also show the results of an evidence calcula\u2032\u2032\ntion for an even\nP simpler model M , in which both\nthe total mass\nm\u03bd and \u03b1 are fixed, over the model\nM . Note that now we are comparing an 8-parameter\nmodel with a 10-parameter model. The results are\n\nshown in Fig. 6 where we have plotted the\nP contour\nvalues of | ln B| as a function of \u03b4\u03b1 and \u03b4 m\u03bd . The\ninner contours from 1 to 5 correspond to values B > 1,\nand so to an evidence which favours the simpler model,\nwhile the outer contours are relative to values B < 1\nand hence to evidence for the more complicated model\nM . The star in the plot refers to the wrong assumption of total degeneracy\n(but fixing the total mass to\nP\nthe true value \u03b4 m\u03bd = 0). As one can see, under\nthese assumptions the data would favour the simpler\nmodel giving a substantial evidence for M \u2032\u2032 .\nThe evidence for the simpler model is due to the\nsmaller number of parameters of M \u2032\u2032 with respect to\nM (the Occams razor term, see [29])P\nand also to the\nnegative degeneracy between \u03b1 and\nm\u03bd (given by\nthe off-diagonal\nterm\nof\nthe\ninverted\nfull\nFisher\nmatrix\np\n(F \u22121 )P m\u03bd \u03b1 / (F \u22121 )\u03b1\u03b1 (F \u22121 )P m\u03bd P m\u03bd \u2243 \u22120.44).\nBecause of this degeneracy there is a region of confusion in the plane of Fig. 6 in which a wrong assumption in \u03b1 is compensated\nP by a wrong, and opposite\nin sign, assumption for\nm\u03bd , leading to evidence in\nfavour of the simpler model M \u2032\u2032 . This explains why\nin Fig. 6 for a fixed \u03b4\u03b1 the the Bayes factor\ninitially\nP\nincreases becoming greater\nthan\n1\nfor\n\u03b4\nm\n\u03bd increasP\ning. Of course when \u03b4 m\u03bd becomes large enough\nthe Bayes factor decreases because the data start to\nfavour the true model M .\nIf one assumes an inverted hierarchy (represented\nby the square in the plot), for example fixing the total mass\nPto the minimum value allowed for this hierarchy ( m\u03bd \u2243 0.11eV) and \u03b1 to a low value (we take\n\u03b1 = 0.05), one obtains a strong evidence for the more\ncomplicated model M .\nThese evidence calculations indicate that a future\nweak lensing survey could become sensitive to the hierarchy of neutrino masses requiring a suitable parameterization of mass splitting. We note however that\neven if a model assuming total degeneracy could be\nstill favoured. This indicates that Planck and Euclid\ndata could give strong evidence for the existence of a\nhierarchy among neutrino masses.\n\n\f8\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have investigated the ability of\nfuture cosmic shear measurements, like those achievable with the proposed Euclid mission, to constrain\ndifferences in the mass of individual neutrino species.\nUsing an explicit parameterization of neutrino mass\nsplitting and a Fisher matrix formalism we have\nfound that the combination Euclid+Planck will reach\nenough sensitivity to put constraints on the fraction\nof mass in the third neutrino mass eigenstate (\u03b1)\nunder the assumption that the neutrino mass scheme\nis described by a normal hierarchy, with fiducial value\n\u03b1 = 0.95: \u03c3\u03b1 = 0.22. We have also investigated the\nparameterization dependence of our results, repeating\nour forecasts calculation for different fiducial values\nof \u03b1 and finding that constraints on \u03b1 are generally\ndecreasing for increasing \u03b1. We have found a loss of\nsensitivity around \u03b1 \u2243 0.88 duePto a strong rotation\nof the degeneracy in the plane\nm\u03bd -\u03b1 in the Euclid\nFisher matrix, suggesting a considerable dependence\nof the results on the fiducial value around this point.\nWe have then studied more deeply the power of detecting neutrino mass splitting considering Bayesian\nevidence. We have found that future data from\nthese experiments will provide strong evidence for\na neutrino mass splitting against a model assuming\ndegeneracy of masses. As a consequence we have\n\n[1] G.

For the dark energy\nequation of state we found a bias greater than the\n1\u03c3 statistical error (\u03c3w = 0.041 from Euclid+Planck)\nassuming an inverted hierarchy \u03b4w = \u22120.047 and\ncomparable with 1\u03c3 assuming degenerate masses\n\u03b4w = \u22120.033.\nIn conclusion we emphasize that, even if these\nconstraints are strongly dependent on the parameterization used, the possibility of having a splitting\nin neutrino masses cannot be neglected in analysing\nfuture data from Euclid-like experiments. A wrong\nassumption about neutrino mass hierarchies can indeed cause non-negligible bias on other cosmological\nparameters and in particular on the dark energy\nequation of state.\nAcknowledgements\nTDK is supported by STFC rolling grant number RA0888.
