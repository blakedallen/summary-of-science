Predictions are provided of the branching fraction as a function of the masses of the\nbottom squark and the gluino. Branching fractions as large as several times 10\u22124 are obtained for\nsupersymmetric particle masses in the range suggested by the analysis of bottom-quark production\ncross sections. Data are shown that limit the range of allowed masses. Forthcoming high-statistics\ndata from the CLEO Collaboration offer possibilities of discovery or significant new bounds on the\nexistence and masses of supersymmetric particles.\nPACS numbers: 14.80.Ly, 12.38.Bx, 14.40.Gx, 13.25.Gv\nKeywords: Upsilon decay, Bottom squark, Gluino, Quarkonium\n\n1\n\n\fA long-standing puzzle in high-energy strong interactions is the fact that the rate for bottom quark (bb\u0304) production at the Fermilab Tevatron collider is two to three times greater\nthan the theoretical prediction from quantum chromodynamics (QCD) [1]. The next-toleading order QCD contributions are large, and a combination of further higher-order effects\nin production and/or fragmentation may eventually reduce the discrepancy [2]. An alternative explanation is offered in Ref. [3] in the context of physics beyond the standard model.\nThere, it is argued that a solution may be provided by the existence of a light bottom\nsquark b\u0303 and a light gluino g\u0303, with masses in the ranges 2 GeV < mb\u0303 < 5.5 GeV and\n12 GeV < mg\u0303 < 16 GeV. The g\u0303 and the b\u0303 are the spin-1/2 and spin-0 supersymmetric\npartners of the gluon (g) and bottom quark (b). The masses of all other supersymmetric\nparticles are assumed to be arbitrarily heavy, i.e., of order the electroweak scale or greater [3].\nWhile this scenario is not among the more popular schemes for supersymmetry breaking,\nthe hypothesis of a light bottom squark is not inconsistent with direct experimental searches\nand indirect constraints from other observables [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Therefore, it is essential either\nto confirm or to refute this proposal by examining its implications for additional processes.\nIn this Letter, we show that high-statistics data being accumulated and analyzed now at\nthe Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) facility [9] could provide definitive confirmation\nof the proposal of Ref. [3] or severely constrain the allowed parameter space [10].\nIn the proposal of Ref. [3], it is possible that the bottom squark is relatively stable and,\nhence, bound states of a bottom squark and bottom antisquark (sbottomonium) could exist.\nThese bound states could be produced in radiative decays of bottomonium states, such as\n\u03a5 \u2192 S\u0303\u03b3, where S\u0303 is the S-wave bound state of a b\u0303b\u0303\u2217 pair. Alternatively, the b\u0303 could decay\npromptly via R-parity and baryon-number violation [3, 7], and no bound state would be\nformed.\nIn this Letter, we compute the rate for an \u03a5(nS) to decay radiatively into an S-wave b\u0303b\u0303\u2217\nbound state. We show that, provided that a bound state is formed, the resonance search\nby the CUSB Collaboration [11] already increases the allowed lower bounds on mb\u0303 and mg\u0303 .\nDiscovery of the bound states may be possible with the high-statistics 2002 CLEO-c data\nset, or a larger range of bottom-squark and gluino masses may be disfavored.\nThe mass eigenstates of the bottom squarks, b\u03031 and b\u03032 , are mixtures of b\u0303L and b\u0303R , the\n\n2\n\n\fb\n\np\n\nq ~\n\na\n\ni\n\nk\n\nb\n\nl\n\n~\n\ng~\nb\n\nj\n\nk\u2212p\n\n\u2212p\n\na\n\nk\n\n*\n\u2212q b\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\nFIG. 1: Feynman diagrams for the process bb \u2192 b\u0303b\u0303\u2217 \u03b3.\n\nsupersymmetry partners the left-handed (L) and right-handed (R) bottom quarks:\n|b\u03031 i = sin \u03b8b\u0303 |b\u0303L i + cos \u03b8b\u0303 |b\u0303R i,\n\n(1a)\n\n|b\u03032 i = cos \u03b8b\u0303 |b\u0303L i \u2212 sin \u03b8b\u0303 |b\u0303R i.\n\n(1b)\n\nWe take b\u03031 to be the eigenstate of lighter mass, and we drop the subscript 1 in the remainder\nof this paper. The mixing angle \u03b8b\u0303 is constrained by the requirement that the coupling of a\nb\u0303b\u0303\u2217 pair to the Z boson be sufficiently small to be compatible with data [4]. At lowest order\n(tree-level), this requirement implies that sin2 \u03b8b\u0303 \u2248 1/6 [12].\n\n1\n\nWe calculate the decay rate \u0393(\u03a5 \u2192 S\u0303\u03b3) in the framework of the nonrelativistic QCD\n(NRQCD) factorization formalism [13].\n\n2\n\nFirst, we compute the amplitude in full QCD\n\nfor the process b(p) + b\u0304(p) \u2192 b\u0303(q) + b\u0303\u2217 (q) + \u03b3(k). Typical Feynman diagrams are shown\nin Fig. 1. The indices i, j, k, and l label the colors of the incident b and b\u0304 and the final b\u0303\nand b\u0303\u2217 , respectively. The color index of the exchanged gluino is a. The Feynman rules [10]\ndepend on the mixing angle \u03b8b\u0303 .\nWe carry out the computation in the bb\u0304 rest frame and choose the radiation gauge. Then,\nthe photon-b\u0303-b\u0303\u2217 vertex vanishes, since it is proportional to \u01eb\u2217 * (2q + k) = \u01eb\u2217 * (2p), where \u01eb\nis the polarization of the photon. Therefore, we need to compute only the two diagrams of\nthe type in Fig. 1(a), in which the photon attaches to the b or the b\u0304. We make use of the\n1\n\n2\n\nIn the first paper of Ref. [12], it is argued that one-loop contributions may render the light g\u0303 and light b\u0303\nscenario inconsistent with data at the 2\u03c3 level, unless the mass of the heavier b\u03032 is less than about 125\nGeV. Making somwhat different assumptions, the authors of the second paper obtain a 5\u03c3 bound of 180\nGeV and the author of the third paper obtains a 3\u03c3 bound of more than 200 GeV. The possibility that\nthe mass of the b\u03032 could be as low as 100 GeV or so is not excluded by data. Analysis of data from e+ e\u2212\ninteractions at LEP, for example, would require first a detailed modeling of the decay modes of the b\u03032 .\nOne can adapt the NRQCD formalism for spin-1/2 quarks to the case of spin-0 squarks by dropping the\nspin-dependent interactions and replacing Pauli fields with scalar fields.\n\n3\n\n\fspin-triplet projector [14]\n1\nu(p, \u03bb1 )v\u0304(\u2212p, \u03bb2 )h 12 \u03bb1 12 \u03bb2 |1 \u01eb\u03a5 i = \u2212 \u221a 6 \u01eb\u03a5 (6 p \u2212 mb ),\n2\n\u03bb1 ,\u03bb2\nX\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u01eb\u03a5 is the polarization of the bb\u0304 system, the Dirac spinors u(p, s1) and v(p, s2)\nhave the relativistic normalization \u016b(p, s)u(p, s) = v\u0304(p, s)v(p, s) = 2Eb (p), and Ei (p) =\np\np2i + m2i .

In the case of equal population of the two transverse polarization states, d\u0393/d(cos \u03b8) = (3/8)(1 + cos2 \u03b8)\u0393, while in the case of longitudinal polarization,\nd\u0393/d(cos \u03b8) = (3/4)(1 \u2212 cos2 \u03b8)\u0393, where \u0393 is found in Eq.

The S\u0303 state is normalized to one particle per unit volume\nin the S\u0303 rest frame. In order to preserve that normalization in the \u03a5 rest frame, one must multiply by\nthe Lorentz-contraction factor for the volume, namely, 2MS\u0303 /(2ES\u0303 ), where ES\u0303 is the energy of the S\u0303 in\nthe \u03a5 rest frame. The factor 1/(2ES\u0303 ) is absorbed into the conventional definition of the phase space.\n\n5\n\n\f\u223c\n\n\u223c\n\n\u223c\n\n\u223c\n\n\u223c\n\nFIG. 2:\n\nBranching fraction for the process \u03a5 \u2192 S\u0303\u03b3 as a function of MS\u0303 .

Here, and throughout this paper, v is the heavyquark or heavy-squark velocity in the onium rest frame.\nIn the vacuum-saturation approximation, the color-singlet production matrix element\nh0|\u00d51S\u0303 (1 S0 )|0i may be replaced by the corresponding decay matrix element hS\u0303|\u00d51 (1 S0 )|S\u0303i,\nwith uncertainties of relative order v 4 . Furthermore, the sbottomonium decay matrix ele-\n\nment hS\u0303|\u00d51 (1 S0 )|S\u0303i is related to the heavy-quarkonium (HQ) matrix element of the same\nmass by\nhS\u0303|\u00d51 (1 S0 )|S\u0303i \u2248 hHQ|O1 (3 S1 )|HQi/2,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere we neglect spin-dependent contributions to the HQ matrix element of relative order v 2 .\nThe expressions on the left and right sides of Eq. (16) are proportional to the squares of the\nsbottomonium and quarkonium wave functions at the origin, respectively. The value of the\nHQ matrix element is known at the \u03a5 mass. We estimate its value at smaller quarkonium\n3/2\n\nmasses by assuming that it scales as mq . This scaling behavior is approximately that\nwhich one obtains from the Martin potential [15], which describes the J/\u03c8 and \u03a5 systems\nreasonably well.

[16]).\n\nIn Fig. 2, we plot the branching fraction (13), for several values of mg\u0303 , as a function of\nMS\u0303 \u2248 2mb\u0303 , using the estimate of the sbottomonium matrix element in Eq. (17). Here, and\n\nin all further numerical estimates, we take sin2 \u03b8b\u0303 = 1/6, mb = 4.73 \u00b1 0.20 GeV, \u03b1 = 1/137,\n\n\u03b1s = 0.2 \u00b1 0.02, and Br(\u03a5 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 )Exp = 2.48 \u00b1 0.06% (Ref.[17]). This value for \u03b1s\n\ncorresponds approximately to the renormalization scale mb , which is an upper bound on the\nmomentum transfer in the radiative decay process.\nIn order to compare our result for the branching fraction with the experimental resolution,\nit is necessary to know the width of the S-wave sbottomonium state. The total width into\nlight hadrons is given, in leading order in \u03b1s , by the width into two gluons. This quantity\nis computed, in leading order in the nonrelativistic expansion, by Nappi [18]:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n4\u03b1s2\n\u0393 S\u0303 \u2192 gg =\n|R(0)|2 ,\n3MS\u03032\n\n(18)\n\nwhere R(0) is the S\u0303 radial wave function at the origin. Using Eq. (17) and taking MS\u0303 \u2248 2mb\u0303 ,\nwe have\n|R(0)|2 =\n\n4\u03c0\nhS\u0303|\u00d51 (1 S0 )|S\u0303i.\nNc\n\n(19)\n\nThe width of the sbottomonium state into light hadrons is less than 10 MeV in the range\nof parameters proposed in the light-bottom-squark scenario [3]. This width is less than the\nenergy resolution in the CUSB search for monochromatic photon signals [11]. Therefore, we\ncan compare our estimate of the branching fraction Br(\u03a5 \u2192 S\u0303\u03b3) directly with the CUSB\n90% confidence level for the exclusion of \u03a5 \u2192 X\u03b3, which is plotted, along with our estimate,\nin Fig. 2. We see that, if a bound state is formed, then a part of the range of mass parameters\nproposed in the light-bottom-squark scenario is disfavored.\nThere are several uncertainties in our calculation. The uncertainty in Br(\u03a5 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 )\nis 2.4%. The uncertainty in mb is 4.2%. The uncertainties in the value of \u03b1s and in the\nlattice computation of the bottomonium matrix element are each about 10%. There is\nalso an uncertainty from the extrapolation of the HQ matrix element from M\u03a5 to MS\u0303 .\nWe estimate it by checking the accuracy of the extrapolation against the phenomenological\nvalues of the wave functions at the origin for the \u03a5 and the J/\u03c8, as determined from\nthe data for the decay rates into lepton pairs combined with the next-to-leading-order QCD\n7\n\n\f\u223c\n\n\u223c\n\nFIG. 3: The regions of the mb\u0303 -mg\u0303 parameter space that are excluded at the 90% confidence level\nby the \u03a5 \u2192 X\u03b3 search of the CUSB Collaboration (shaded region) [11]. The solid curve represents\nthe central value of the theoretical calculation, and the dashed curves show the uncertainties on\nthe theoretical values, as described in the text. The strip shows the region 2 < mb\u0303 < 5.5 GeV,\n12 < mg\u0303 < 16 GeV proposed in the light-bottom-squark scenario [3].\n\nexpressions for those decay rates. We conclude that the extrapolation error is approximately\n31% \u00d7 (M\u03a5 \u2212 MS\u0303 )/(M\u03a5 \u2212 MJ/\u03c8 ). There are uncalculated relativistic corrections of the order\nof the square of the heavy-quark or squark velocity in the onium rest frame. We estimate\nthese to yield an uncertainty in the decay rate of 20% \u00d7 (M\u03a5 \u2212 MS\u0303 )/(M\u03a5 \u2212 MJ/\u03c8 ) + 10%.\nThere are uncertainties from uncalculated corrections of higher order in \u03b1s and from the\nimprecision in the value of the renormalization scale. We estimate these by varying the scale\nof \u03b1s from mb /2 to 2mb . This procedure yields uncertainties in \u03b1s of +33% and \u221218%. As\nMS\u0303 approaches M\u03a5 , the momentum transfer in the radiative decay becomes considerably\nless than mb , and, in this region, our choice of scale probably results in an underestimate of\nthe decay rate. In this same region, we expect to find violations of the NRQCD factorization,\nwhich holds only for M\u03a5 \u2212 MS\u0303 \u226b \u039bQCD .\nIn Fig. 3 we show the region excluded by the CUSB data. We calculate the uncertainty\nband on the boundary of the excluded region by adding, in quadrature, the theoretical\nuncertainties mentioned above. We also plot the values of mg\u0303 and mb\u0303 that are suggested in\nthe light-bottom-squark scenario [3]. At mg\u0303 = 12 GeV, provided that the bottom squark\nlifetime is great enough to permit formation of the b\u0303b\u0303\u2217 bound state, the mass range mb\u0303 <\n3.5+0.4\n\u22120.6 GeV is excluded at the 90% confidence level by the CUSB data. At mg\u0303 = 16 GeV,\n8\n\n\fthe central and upper values of the excluded range are mb\u0303 = 3.0 and 3.6 GeV, but the\ntheoretical uncertainties do not permit us to specify a lower limit at the 90% confidence\nlevel. One can probe the region of higher bottom-squark masses by increasing the statistics\nof the photon sample and by examining decays from bottomonium states of higher mass,\nsuch as the \u03a5(3S) and the \u03a5(4S).\n\n4\n\nBottom squarks with mass 2 GeV < mb\u0303 < 5.5 GeV along with gluinos with mass\n12 GeV < mg\u0303 < 16 GeV are proposed in Ref. [3] to explain the larger-than-predicted\nrate for bottom quark (bb\u0304) production at the Fermilab collider. In this Letter, we show\nthat CUSB data on radiative \u03a5 decays already provide an important additional constraint\non the mass ranges. The high-statistics 2002 CLEO data should either permit discovery of\nsquarkonium bound states, confirm the exclusion region of the earlier CUSB data, or further\nnarrow the allowed range of supersymmetry parameter space.\nWe acknowledge valuable conversations with D.
