Introduction and statement of the results\nOur discussion will use the canonical setup: X = (Xt )t\u22650 denotes the canonical process\non the Skorohod space of c\u00e0dl\u00e0g trajectories, F denotes \u03c3-field generated by X (also\nwritten \u03c3(Xs , s \u2265 0)), (Ft , t \u2265 0) is the canonical filtration, where Ft = \u03c3(Xs , s \u2264 t) and\n\u03b8t , t \u2265 0, are the shift operators given by \u03b8t (\u03c9)s = \u03c9t+s . Emphasis is placed on the various\nprobability measures considered.\nFocus will be placed on two special (Markovian) families of probability measures,\ndenoted (Px , x \u2208 R) and (P\u2191x , x \u2265 0). The probability measure P0 corresponds to the\nlaw of a L\u00e9vy process: under P0 the canonical process has independent and stationary\nincrements and starts at 0. Then Px is simply the law of x + X under P0 , and under each\nPx the canonical process is Markov and the conditional law of (Xt+s , s \u2265 0) given Ft is\nPXt . (Collections of probability measures on Skorohod space satisfying the latter property\n\nThis is an electronic reprint of the original article published by the ISI/BS in Bernoulli,\n2014, Vol. 20, No. 1, 190\u2013206. This reprint differs from the original in pagination and\ntypographic detail.\n1350-7265\n\nc\n\n2014 ISI/BS\n\n\f2\n\nG. Uribe Bravo\n\nare termed Markovian families.) We also make use of the dual L\u00e9vy process by letting P\u0302x\ndenote the law of x \u2212 X under P0 . Associated to Px , x \u2208 R, P\u2191x can be interpreted as the\nlaw of the L\u00e9vy process conditioned to stay positive; as this event can have probability\nzero, the precise definition of P\u2191x can be described as follows: a L\u00e9vy process conditioned\nto stay positive is the (weak) limit of X conditioned to stay positive until an independent\nexponential T\u03b1 of parameter \u03b1 as \u03b1 \u2192 0 (cf. Chaumont and Doney [5], Proposition 1).\nIt is actually simpler to actually construct L\u00e9vy processes conditioned to stay positive\nby a Doob transformation and justifying this passage to the limit afterwards, as recalled\nin Section 4.\nUnder very general conditions, given a Markovian family of probability laws like\n(Px , x \u2208 R), one can construct weakly continuous versions of the conditional laws of\n(Xs , s \u2264 t) under Px given Xt = y. They are termed bridges of Px between x and y of\nlength t and usually denoted Ptx,y . In Section 2, we review the construction of these\nbridges from Chaumont and Uribe Bravo [9]. Our first result is to show that one can\napply this general recipe to the laws P\u2191x . To this end, we impose two conditions on the\nL\u00e9vy process.\nR\n(K) Under P0 and for any t > 0, |E0 (eiuXt )| du < \u221e.\n(R) 0 is regular for both half-lines (\u2212\u221e, 0) and (0, \u221e).\nAssumption (K) was introduced by Kallenberg as a means of imposing the existence\nof densities for the law of Xt for any t > 0 which posses good properties (in particular\ncontinuity). A construction of L\u00e9vy process bridges under hypothesis (K) was first accomplished in Kallenberg [16] by means of convergence criteria for processes with exchangeable increments. This construction is retaken as an example of the general construction\nof Markovian bridges in Chaumont and Uribe Bravo [9].\n\u2191\nTheorem 1. Under (K) and (R), we can construct bridges P\u2191,t\nx,y of Px for any x, y \u2265 0\nand t > 0 and that they are weakly continuous as functions of x and y.\n\nTheorem 1 presents another example of the applicability of Theorem 1 in Chaumont\nand Uribe Bravo [9], and the proof of the former consists on verifying the technical\nhypotheses in the latter. These technical hypotheses are basically: the existence of a\ncontinuous and positive version of the densities of Xt under P\u2191x . For nonzero starting\nstates, we will inherit absolute continuity from that of the L\u00e9vy process killed upon\nbecoming negative (in Lemma 3) and the later can be studied by a technique inspired from\nHunt [15] for the Brownian case, in which a transition density for the killed L\u00e9vy process\nis obtained from a transition density of the L\u00e9vy process using its bridges. (Cf. Equation\n(5.1) and Lemma 2.) Hunt's technique has typically allowed only the construction of\nlower semicontinuous versions of the density, but with weakly continuous bridges one\ncan show that Hunt's density is actually continuous. This is one possible application\nof the existence of weakly continuous Markovian bridges. Another problem is then to\ncharacterize the points at which the density is positive. Hunt does this for Brownian\nmotion and the result has been extended to (multidimensional) stable L\u00e9vy processes in\nthe symmetric case by Chen and Song [10], Theorem 2.4 and in the asymmetric case by\n\n\fBridges of L\u00e9vy processes conditioned to stay positive\n\n3\n\nVondra\u010dek [24], Theorem 3.2. We study positivity of the density by exploiting the cyclic\nexchangeability property of L\u00e9vy processes, following Knight [17].\nRecall that when P0 is the law of Brownian motion, Ptx,y is the law of the Brownian\nbridge between x and y of length t and the corresponding law P\u2191,t\n0,0 is the law of a Brownian\nexcursion of length t. In this context, our next result is an extension to L\u00e9vy processes of\nthe classical result of Durrett, Iglehart and Miller [13], which covers the Brownian case.\nCorollary 1. The conditional law of (Xs , s \u2264 t) under Pt0,0 given X t > \u2212\u03b5, where\nX t = inf Xs ,\ns\u2264t\n\nconverges weakly, as \u03b5 \u2192 0 to P\u2191,t\n0,0 .\nThe Brownian case of Corollary 1 was first proved by Durrett, Iglehart and Miller\n[13] by showing the convergence of finite-dimensional distributions and then tightness,\nwhich follows from explicit computations with Brownian densities. Another proof for\nthe Brownian case was given by Blumenthal [3] this time using rescaling, random time\nchange and simple infinitesimal generator computations. For us, Corollary 1 is a simple\nconsequence of Theorem 1.\nWe now present a generalization of a decomposition of the Brownian trajectory at the\ntime it reaches its minimum on a given interval due to Denisov [11].\nLet \u03c1t be the first time that X reaches its minimum on the interval [0, t]. Consider the\npre- and post-minimum processes on the interval [0, t] given by:\nXs\u2190 = X(\u03c1t \u2212s)+ \u2212 \u2212 X t\n\nand Xs\u2192 = X(\u03c1t +s)\u2227t \u2212 X t\n\ndefined for s \u2265 0, where Xs\u2212 is the left limit of X at s.\nA L\u00e9vy meander of length t (following Chaumont and Doney [7]) is the weak limit as\n\u03b5 \u2192 0 of X conditioned to remain above \u2212\u03b5 on [0, t] under P0 . L\u00e9vy meanders can also\nbe characterized by an absolute continuity relationship with L\u00e9vy processes conditioned\nto stay positive as recalled in Section 4. Denote by Pme,t the law of a meander of length\nt and by P\u0302me,t the meander of the dual L\u00e9vy process.\nTheorem 2. Assume conditions (K) and (R). Under P0 , the conditional law of\n(X \u2190 , X \u2192 ) given \u03c1t is P\u0302me,\u03c1t \u2297 Pme,t\u2212\u03c1t .\nThe previous result is a consequence of results in Chaumont and Doney [5]. It is our\nstepping stone on the way to our generalization of Vervaat's relationship between the\nBrownian bridge and the normalized Brownian excursion. This extension requires the\nfollowing conditioned version of Theorem 2.\nTheorem 3. A regular conditional distribution of (X \u2190 , X \u2192 ) given \u03c1t = s and \u2212X t = y\n\u2191,t\u2212s\nunder Pt0,0 is P\u0302\u2191,s\n0,y \u2297 P0,y .\n\n\f4\n\nG. Uribe Bravo\n\nWe finally turn to an extension of the classical relationship between the Brownian\nbridge between 0 and 0 and the Brownian excursion of the same length.\nTheorem 4. Define the Vervaat transformation V of X on [0, t] by\nVs = X(\u03c1t +s) mod t \u2212 X t .\nUnder (K) and (R), the law of V under Pt0,0 is P\u2191,t\n0,0 .\nTheorem 4 was found by Vervaat [23] for Brownian motion and proved there using\napproximation by a simple random walk. Biane [2] gives a proof using excursion theory\nfor Brownian motion. Then Chaumont [4] gave a definition of normalized stable excursion\nand proved Theorem 4 in the case of stable L\u00e9vy processes, again using excursion theory.\nThis extension of Vervaat's theorem is the closest to the one in this work. Miermont\n[18] gives a version of Theorem 4 for spectrally positive L\u00e9vy processes in the context of\nthe intensity measures for excursions above the cumulative minimum, with an explicit\nlink with the L\u00e9vy process conditioned to stay positive. Finally, Fourati [14] gives an\nabstract version of Theorem 4 for L\u00e9vy processes, again as a relation between two \u03c3finite measures which can be though of as bridges of random length, although there is\nno explicit link with L\u00e9vy processes conditioned to stay positive. After establishing this\nlink, Theorem 4 would follow from the theory developed in Fourati [14] using regularity\nresults for bridges (like weak continuity) in order to condition by the length. Instead of\nthat, we propose a direct proof.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sections 2 and 3, we review the construction\nof Markovian and L\u00e9vy bridges of Chaumont and Uribe Bravo [9]. In Section 4, we\ndefine, following Chaumont and Doney [5], L\u00e9vy processes conditioned to stay positive\nand meanders. Section 5 is devoted to the construction of bridges of L\u00e9vy processes\nconditioned to stay positive, where we prove Theorem 1 and Corollary 1. In Section\n6, we consider extensions and consequences of Denisov's theorem, proving in particular\nTheorems 2 and 3. Finally, in Section 7, we prove our extension of Vervaat's theorem,\nwhich is Theorem 4.\n\n2. Weakly continuous bridges of Markov processes\nLet Px be the law of a Feller process which starts at x which is an element of a polish\nspace S (for us either R, (0, \u221e), or [0, \u221e)). Suppose P is its semigroup and assume that:\n(AC) There is a \u03c3-finite measure \u03bc and a function ht (x, *) such that\nZ\nPt f (x) = f (y)ht (x, y)\u03bc(dy).\n(C) The function (s, x, y) 7\u2192 hs (x, y) is continuous.\n\n\f5\n\nBridges of L\u00e9vy processes conditioned to stay positive\n(CK) The Chapman\u2013Kolmogorov equations\nZ\nhs+t (x, z) = hs (x, y)ht (y, z)\u03bc(dy)\nare satisfied.\nLet us denote by B\u03b4 (y) the ball of radius \u03b4 centered at y and\nPx,t = {y \u2208 S: ht (x, y) > 0}.\n\nTheorem 5 (Chaumont and Uribe Bravo [9]).

L\u00e9vy processes and their bridges\nLet Px be the Markovian family of a L\u00e9vy process which satisfies assumptions (K) and\n(R). As argued by Kallenberg [16], Fourier inversion implies that Xt possesses continuous\nand bounded densities which vanish at infinity (by the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma) for\nall t > 0. Actually, (K) also implies that the continuous version ft of the density of Xt\nunder P0 satisfies a form of the Chapman\u2013Kolmogorov equations:\nZ\nft (x) = fs (y)ft\u2212s (x \u2212 y) dy\nfor 0 < s < t.\n(3.1)\n\n\f6\n\nG. Uribe Bravo\n\nFrom ft one can build a bi-continuous transition density pt by means of pt (x, y) = ft (y \u2212\nx) which satisfies (AC), (C) and (CK).\nUnder hypotheses (K) and (R), Sharpe [22] shows that ft is strictly positive for all\nt > 0, which implies that pt > 0.\nFrom Theorem 5, we see that under (K) and (R), we can consider the bridges Ptx,y\nfrom x to y of length t for any x, y \u2208 R and any t > 0, and that these are jointly weakly\ncontinuous in x and y.\n\n4. L\u00e9vy processes conditioned to stay positive and\nmeanders\nThe most general construction for L\u00e9vy processes conditioned to stay positive, now recalled, is from Chaumont and Doney [5] (see Chaumont and Doney [6] for a correction\nand Doney [12] for a lecture note presentation). When the initial state is positive, it is a\nDoob transformation of Px by a procedure we now detail. Let\nX t = min Xs\ns\u2264t\n\nand consider the Markov process R = X \u2212 X. Under (R), 0 is regular state of R for itself\nand so we can consider the local time at zero L of R. We can then define the downwards\nladder height process H of X by\nH = \u2212X \u25e6 L,\nwhich is a (possibly killed) subordinator (cf. Bertoin [1] or Doney [12]). Let h be the\nrenewal function of H given by\n\u0012Z \u221e\n\u0013\nh(x) = E\n1Hs \u2264x ds .\n0\n\nFor x > 0, let Qx be the law of x + X under P killed when it leaves (0, \u221e), which is a\nMarkov process on (0, \u221e) whose semigroup is denoted Q = (Qt , t \u2265 0). Chaumont and\nDoney [5] prove that if X drifts to \u2212\u221e (limt\u2192\u221e Xt = \u2212\u221e almost surely) then h is\nexcessive and otherwise h is invariant for Qt and proceed to define the semigroup Pt\u2191 by\nPt\u2191 (x, dy) =\n\nh(y)\nQt (x, dy)\nh(x)\n\nfor x > 0.\n\nThe Markovian laws P\u2191x , x > 0, define the L\u00e9vy process conditioned to stay positive. Note\nthat X has finite lifetime under P\u2191x if and only if X drifts to \u2212\u221e under Px . Under\nhypothesis (R), Chaumont and Doney [5] prove that P\u2191x has a weak limit (in the Skorhod\nJ1 topology) as x \u2192 0, denoted P\u21910 , and that (P\u2191x )x\u22650 is Markovian and has the Feller\nproperty.\nWe now give an alternate definition of the meander, from which one can justify the\nweak limit construction we have alluded to (cf. Chaumont and Doney [7], Lemma 4).\n\n\f7\n\nBridges of L\u00e9vy processes conditioned to stay positive\n\nA L\u00e9vy meander is a stochastic process whose law Pme,t satisfies the following absolute\ncontinuity relationship with respect to the law P\u21910 on Ft = \u03c3(Xs : s \u2264 t):\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\n\u2191\n\u2191\nPme,t |Ft =\n.\nwith\n\u03b2\n=\nE\n*\nP\n|\nt\nF\n0\n0 t\n\u03b2t h(Xt\u2191 )\nh(Xt\u2191 )\n\n5. Bridges of L\u00e9vy processes conditioned to stay\npositive\nWe now construct the bridges of a L\u00e9vy process conditioned to stay positive under hypotheses (K) and (R). This is done through Theorem 5 by verifying the existence of a\ncontinuous version of their densities (cf. Lemma 3). For positive arguments, the density\nis constructed from the density of the killed L\u00e9vy process, a continuous version of which\nis constructed using bridges of the L\u00e9vy process itself in Lemma 2. Then, a delicate\npoint is to study the densities at 0; this requires the following duality lemma. Let P\u0302x be\nthe law of x \u2212 X and let P\u0302t be its semigroup. We can also consider the objects \u0125, P\u0302\u2191x ,\netc. . . associated with \u2212X instead of X as well as p\u0302.\nLemma 1. The semigroups Pt\u2191 and P\u0302t\u2191 are in duality with respect to the measure \u03bb\u2191\ngiven by\n\u03bb\u2191 (dx) = h(x)\u0125(x) dx.\nProof. Since Pt and P\u0302t are in duality with respect to Lebesgue measure \u03bb, it follows\nthat Qt and Q\u0302t are also in duality with respect to \u03bb.\nHence, we get\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nQt (gh)\n\u2191\n\u2191\nh\u0125 d\u03bb = Q\u0302t (f \u0125)gh d\u03bb = P\u0302t\u2191 (f )gh\u0125 d\u03bb\nf Pt (g) d\u03bb = f\nh\nZ\n= P\u0302t\u2191 (f )g d\u03bb\u2191 .\n\u0003\nWe now consider the absolute continuity of the semigroup of X killed when it becomes\nnegative.\nLemma 2. Under (K) and (R), let\nqt (x, y) = Etx,y (X t > 0)pt (x, y)\n\nfor x, y > 0.\n\n(5.1)\n\nThen qt is a transition density for Qt with respect to Lebesgue measure which is continuous, strictly positive, bounded by p, satisfies the Chapman\u2013Kolmogorov equations, and\nwhich satisfies the following duality formula:\nqt (x, y) = q\u0302t (y, x).\n\n\f8\n\nG. Uribe Bravo\n\nRemark. It is simple to see that the absolute continuity of Pt (x, *) translates into absolute continuity of Qt (x, *) since if A has Lebesgue measure zero then\nQt (x, A) = Px (Xt \u2208 A, X t > 0) \u2264 Px (Xt \u2208 A) = 0.\nWhat is more difficult, is to see that the q is strictly positive; similar results have been\nobtained in the literature for killed (multidimensional) Brownian motion and stable L\u00e9vy\nprocesses in Hunt [15], Chen and Song [10], Vondra\u010dek [24]. Our proof of uses the weakly\ncontinuous Markovian bridges provided by Theorem 5. The almost sure positivity of q\ncan also be obtained from Theorem 4 of Pitman and Uribe Bravo [20].\nProof of Lemma 2. Conditioning on Xt , we see that\nEx (1X t >0 f (Xt )) = Ex [Ptx,Xt (X t > 0)f (Xt )]\nZ\n= Ptx,y (X t > 0)f (y)pt (x, y)\u03bb(dy)\nfor measurable and bounded f . On the other hand, the definition of the law Qt gives\nZ\nEx (1X t >0 f (Xt )) = Qx (f (Xt )) = f (y)Qt (x, dy)\nso that q is a transition density of Q with respect to Lebesgue measure.\nWe know that p is continuous. To see that q is continuous, it suffices to apply the\nportemanteau theorem. Note that the boundary \u2202{X t > 0} of {X t > 0} has Ptx,y -measure\nzero. Indeed, since the minimum on [0, t] is a continuous functional on Skorohod space\n(cf. Whitt [25], Section 13.4):\n\u2202{X t > 0} \u2282 {Xs \u2265 0 for all s \u2208 [0, t] and there exists s \u2208 [0, t] such that Xs = 0}.\nSince x, y > 0 and under Ptx,y we have X0+ = x and Xt\u2212 = y almost surely, we see that\nthe process cannot touch zero at times 0 or t. However, using the local absolute continuity\nrelationship (2.2) at the first time T such that XT = 0, we see that Ptx,y (\u2202{X t > 0} = 0)\nas soon as\nPx (Touching zero on (0, t) and staying nonnegative) = 0,\nwhich is true since 0 is regular for (\u2212\u221e, 0).\nTo prove the duality formula for q, we first Proposition II.1 of Bertoin [1], which\nproves that pt (x, y) = p\u0302t (y, x) for almost all x and y and remove the almost all qualifier\nby continuity. Next, Corollary II.3 of Bertoin [1] proves that for almost all x and y the\nimage of Ptx,y under the time reversal operator is P\u0302ty,x , which by weak continuity of\nbridge laws can be extended to every x and y. Since the event X t is invariant under time\nreversal, we see that\nqt (x, y) = Etx,y (X t > 0)pt (x, y) = \u00caty,x (X t > 0)p\u0302t (y, x) = q\u0302t (y, x).\n\n\f9\n\nBridges of L\u00e9vy processes conditioned to stay positive\n\nBy definition, we see that q \u2264 p almost everywhere, and so continuity implies that q\nis bounded by p everywhere; this will help us prove that q satisfies the (CK) equations.\nIndeed, the Markov property implies that\nZ\nqt+s (x, z) = qs (x, y)qt (y, z)\u03bb(dy)\nfor \u03bb-almost all z.\n(5.2)\nSince\n0 \u2264 qs (x, y)qt (y, z) \u2264 ps (x, y)pt (y, z)\nand\nZ\n\nps (x, y)pt (y, z)\u03bb(dz) = pt+s (x, z),\n\nwhich is continuous in z, the generalized dominated convergence theorem tells us that\nZ\nz 7\u2192 qs (x, y)qt (y, z)\u03bb(dy)\nis continuous (on (0, \u221e)). Because both sides of (5.2) are continuous, we can change the\nalmost sure qualifier to for all z.\nIt remains to see that qt (x, y) > 0 if x, y, t > 0. We first prove that for any x, y, t > 0, if\n\u03b4 > 0 is such that B\u03b4 (y) \u2282 (0, \u221e), then\nQt (x, B\u03b4 (y)) > 0.\n\n(5.3)\n\nThis is done by employing a technique of Knight [17]. For any s \u2208 (0, t), consider the\nprocess (Xrs , r \u2264 t) given by\nXrs = X0 + X(r+s) mod t \u2212 Xs .\nSince X has independent and stationary increments, then, for any fixed s, the laws of\nX s and (Xr , r \u2264 t) coincide under Px for any x \u2208 R; this is referred to as the cyclic\nexchangeability property in Chaumont, Hobson and Yor [8]. Note that Xts = Xt ; if s is\nclose to the place where X reaches its minimum on (0, t), then the minimum X st of X s\non the interval [0, t] is positive. Hence, the random variable\nI=\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nt\n\n1X st >0,Xt \u2208B\u03b4 (y) ds\n\nis positive on {Xt \u2208 B\u03b4 (y)} which has positive probability since pt is strictly positive. On\nthe other hand, from cyclic exchangeability, we can compute:\n0 < Ex (I) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nt\n\nPx [X st > 0, Xts \u2208 B\u03b4 (y)] ds = tPx [X t > 0, Xt \u2208 B\u03b4 (y)] = tQt (x, B\u03b4 (y)),\n\n\f10\n\nG. Uribe Bravo\n\nwhich proves (5.3). To prove positivity of qt , first note that since P\u0302y almost surely X0+ =\ny, then for s small enough:\nQ\u0302s (y, B\u03b4 (y)) = P\u0302y (Xs \u2208 B\u03b4 (y), X s > 0) \u2265 P\u0302y (Xr \u2208 B\u03b4 (y) for all r \u2208 [0, s]) > 0,\nso that, by continuity of qs , there exists an open subset Us of B\u03b4 (y) such that qs (*, y) =\nq\u0302s (y, *) > 0 on Us . By Chapman\u2013Kolmogorov and (5.3), we see that\nZ\nQt\u2212s (x, dz)qs (z, y) > 0.\nqt (x, y) \u2265\n\u0003\nUs\nWe now turn to a similar result for L\u00e9vy processes conditioned to stay positive.\nLemma 3. Under (K) and (R), Pt\u2191 (x, *) is equivalent to Lebesgue measure for all t > 0\nand x \u2265 0. Furthermore, there exists a version of the transition density p\u2191 which is\ncontinuous, strictly positive, and satisfies the Chapman\u2013Kolmogorov equations.\nTherefore, the density p\u2191 satisfies the assumptions (AC), (C) and (CK) of Theorem 5.\nProof of Lemma 3. Since the renewal function of a subordinator is positive, continuous\nand finite, we deduce by h-transforms and Lemma 2 that the function\np\u2191t (x, y) =\n\nqt (x, y)\nh(x)\u0125(y)\n\n,\n\nx > 0, y > 0, t > 0,\n\nis a transition density for P \u2191 starting at positive states:\nZ\nPt\u2191 f (x) = p\u2191t (x, y)f (y)\u03bb\u2191 (dy)\nfor x > 0.\nNotice that p\u2191 so defined is strictly positive, continuous, and satisfies the Chapman\u2013\nKolmogorov equations.\nFor 0 < s < t, consider the function\nZ\n\u2191s\npt (y) = Ps\u2191 (0, dx)p\u2191t\u2212s (x, y) > 0\nfor y > 0.\nOn one hand, Chapman\u2013Kolmogorov implies that for any bounded measurable f :\nZ\nZZ\nZ\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\u2191\np\u2191s\n(y)f\n(y)\u03bb\n(dy)\n=\nP\n(0,\ndx)p\n(x,\ny)f\n(y)\u03bb\n(dy)\n=\nPt\u2191 (0, dy)f (y),\nt\ns\nt\u2212s\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\u2032\nso that p\u2191s\nt is a version of the density of Pt (0, *) with respect to \u03bb and so if 0 < s < s < t\n\u2191s\n\u2191s\n\u2191s\u2032\nthen pt (y) = pt (y) for \u03bb-almost all y. On the other hand, we now see that pt (y) is\n\n\f11\n\nBridges of L\u00e9vy processes conditioned to stay positive\n\na continuous function of y, so that actually, the almost sure qualifier can be dropped.\nIndeed, since\nMt\u2212s := sup pt\u2212s (x, y) < \u221e\nx,y\n\nand from Chaumont and Doney [5]\n\u03b2s := P\u21910 (1/h(Xs )) < \u221e,\ncontinuity of p\u2191s\nt follows from the dominated convergence theorem.\nWe can now define\np\u2191t (0, y) = p\u2191s\nt (y),\n\ny > 0,\n\nfor any s \u2208 (0, t). Since p\u2191t (0, y) is continuous for y \u2208 (0, \u221e), and is a version of the density\nof Pt\u2191 (0, *), the Markov property implies:\nZ\np\u2191t+s (0, y) = p\u2191t (0, x)p\u2191s (x, y)\u03bb\u2191 (dx).\nFurthermore, we have the bound\np\u2191t (0, y) \u2264 \u03b2s Mt\u2212s /\u0125(y)\n\nfor y > 0.\n\nWe now provide an uniform bound for the transition density in the initial state.

Uribe Bravo\n\nwhere\nAk,n = {mk,n \u2264 Xs for s \u2264 k/2n },\nBk,n = {mk,n \u2264 Xs for s \u2208 [(k + 1)/2n , t]}\nand\nmk,n =\n\ninf\n\nr\u2208[k/2n ,(k+1)/2n ]\n\nXr .\n\nApplying the Markov property at time (k + 1)/2n we obtain\nE0 (F (X*\u2227\u03c1n )f (\u03c1n )G(X(\u03c1n +1/2n +*)\u2227t \u2212 mk,n )1\u03c1n =k/2n )\n= E0 (F (X*\u2227\u03c1n )f (\u03c1n )H(t \u2212 (k + 1)/2n , X(k+1)/2n , X (k+1)/2n )1Ak,n ),\nwhere\nH(s, x, y) = Ex (G(X s \u2212 y)1X s >y ) = Ex\u2212y (G(X s )1X s >0 ).\nBy reversing our steps, we obtain\nE0 (F (X*\u2227\u03c1n )f (\u03c1n )H(t \u2212 (k + 1)/2n , X(k+1)/2n , X (k+1)/2n )1Ak,n )\n= E0 (F (X*\u2227\u03c1n )f (\u03c1n )H\u0303(t \u2212 (k + 1)/2n , X(k+1)/2n , X (k+1)/2n )1\u03c1nt =k/2n ),\nwhere\nH\u0303(s, x, y) = Ex\u2212y (G(X s ) |X s > 0).\nBy the continuity assumptions of f, F and G we can pass to the limit using the\nChaumont\u2013Doney lemma to get\nE0 (F (X*\u2227\u03c1t )f (\u03c1t )G(X \u2192 )) = E0 [F (X*\u2227\u03c1t )f (\u03c1t )Eme,t\u2212\u03c1t (G)].\nBy time reversal at t, we see that\nE0 (F (X \u2190 )f (\u03c1t )G(X \u2192 )) = E0 [\u00came,\u03c1t (F )f (\u03c1t )Eme,t\u2212\u03c1t (G)].\n\n\u0003\n\nWe now establish a Denisov-type decomposition for bridges of L\u00e9vy processes.\nProof of Theorem 3. Since 0 is regular for (\u2212\u221e, 0) under P0 , using local absolute\ncontinuity between Pt0,0 and P0 we see that X t < 0 and \u03c1t > 0 almost surely under Pt0,0 .\nTime reversal and regularity of 0 for (0, \u221e) proves that \u03c1t < t almost surely under Pt0,0 .\nFrom the absolute continuity relationship between the meander and the L\u00e9vy process\nconditioned to stay positive, we see that P\u2191,t\n0,x is a regular conditional probability of X\ngiven Xt = x under Pme,t . Hence, Theorem 2 allows the conclusion\n\u2191,\u03c1t\n\u2191,\u03c1t\nE0 (F1 (X \u2190 )f (\u03c1t )g(X t , Xt )F2 (X \u2192 )) = E0 [\u00ca0,\u2212X\n(F1 )f (\u03c1t )g(X t , Xt )\u00ca0,X\n(F2 )].\nt \u2212X\nt\n\nt\n\n\f15\n\nBridges of L\u00e9vy processes conditioned to stay positive\nHence, we see that for every continuous and bounded f, g1 , g2 , F1 , F2 :\nZ\nEt0,x [F1 (X \u2190 )f (\u03c1t )g1 (X t )F2 (X \u2192 )]g2 (x)pt (0, x) dx\n=\n\nZ\n\n\u2191,\u03c1t\n\u2191,\u03c1t\nEt0,x [\u00ca0,X\n(F1 )f (\u03c1t )g1 (X t )E0,X\n(F2 )]g2 (x)pt (0, x) dx.\nt\n\nt\n\nSince both integrands are continuous because of weak continuity of the bridge laws (of\nthe L\u00e9vy process, its dual, and their conditioning to remain positive), we see that\n\u2191,\u03c1t\n\u2191,\u03c1t\n(F1 )f (\u03c1t )g1 (X t )E0,X\n(F2 )].\nEt0,0 (F1 (X \u2190 )f (\u03c1t )g1 (X t )F2 (X \u2192 )) = Et0,0 [\u00ca0,X\nt\n\nt\n\n\u0003\n\nTheorems 2 and 3 imply the following corollary.\nCorollary 2. The joint law of (\u03c1t , X t , Xt ) under P0 admits the expression\nP0 (\u03c1t \u2208 ds, \u2212X t \u2208 dy, Xt \u2212 X t \u2208 dz) = P0 (\u03c1t \u2208 ds)P\u0302me,s (Xs \u2208 dy)Pme,t\u2212s (Xt\u2212s \u2208 dz).\nThe joint law of (\u03c1t , X t ) under Pt0,0 admits the expression\nPt0,0 (\u03c1t \u2208 ds, \u2212X t \u2208 dy) =\n\nP0 (\u03c1t \u2208 ds) me,s\nP\u0302\n(Xs \u2208 dy)Pme,t\u2212s (Xt\u2212s \u2208 dy).\npt (0, 0)\n\n7. An extension of Vervaat's theorem\nIn this section, we prove Theorem 4.\nProof of Theorem 4. Let \u03bbt be Lebesgue measure on (0, t); we will work under the\nlaw P\u2191,t\n0,0 \u2297 \u03bbt and we keep the notation X for the canonical process (which is now defined\non the product space \u03a9 \u00d7 (0, t)) and U will be the projection in the second coordinate of\nthis space. Then a regular version of the law of Xr\u2227U , r \u2265 0, and X(U+r)\u2227t , r \u2265 0, given\n\u2191,t\nU = u and XU = y is P\u2191,t\n0,y \u2297 Py,0 and the law of (U, XU ) admits the following density:\n(u, y) 7\u2192\n\np\u2191s (0, y)p\u2191t\u2212s (y, 0)\nt * p\u2191t (0, 0)\n\ndu \u03bb\u2191 (dx).\n\nOn the other hand, the Vervaat transformation of X is the concatenation of X \u2192\nfollowed by the time-reversal of X \u2190 at \u03c1t ; under Pt0,0 , the joint law of (X \u2192 , X \u2190 ) given\n\u2191,t\u2212s\n\u03c1t = t \u2212 s and X t = y is P\u2191,s\n0,y \u2297 Py,0 .\nWe finish the proof by identifying the law of (t \u2212 \u03c1t , X t ) under Pt0,0 with that of (U, XU )\nunder P\u2191,t\n0,0 \u00d7 \u03bb1 . Indeed, by Corollary 2, a version of the density with respect to Lebesgue\nmeasure of (t \u2212 \u03c1t , \u2212X t ) at (s, y) is\nP0 (\u03c1t \u2208 t \u2212 ds)p\u2191t\u2212s (0, y)p\u2191s (y, 0)h(y)\u0125(y)\npt (0, 0)\u03b2\u0302t\u2212s \u03b2s\n\n.\n\n\f16\n\nG. Uribe Bravo\n\nHowever, by the Chapman\u2013Kolmogorov equations we can obtain the marginal density of\n\u03c1t under Pt0,0 at u:\nP0 (\u03c1t \u2208 t \u2212 ds)p\u2191t (0, 0)\npt (0, 0)\u03b2\u0302t\u2212s \u03b2s\n\n.\n\nSince \u03c1t has an uniform law under Pt0,0 as proved in Knight [17], then, actually the above\nexpression is almost surely equal to 1/t so that a joint density of (\u03c1t , X t ) under Pt0,0 is\n(u, y) 7\u2192\n\np\u2191s (0, y)p\u2191t\u2212s (y, 0)\nt * p\u2191t (0, 0)\n\ndu \u03bb\u2191 (dy).\n\n\u0003\n\nNote added in proof\nIt has been pointed out to the author that the proof of what we state as Theorem 5\n(taken from reference [9]) has an error. Since we use this theorem to construct our\nbridges, the reader should note that Theorem 5 has a simple proof when the Markov\nprocess in the statement has a Feller dual. This is the case both for L\u00e9vy processes and\nfor L\u00e9vy processes conditioned to stay positive (thanks to Lemma 1 for the latter), and\nthis ensures the validity of the results in this paper.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe author would like to thank Lo\u0131\u0308c Chaumont, Pat Fitzsimmons, and Jim Pitman for\nstimulating conversations, information, references which were helpful in developing this\nresearch, and for spotting some obscurities and errors in the paper.
