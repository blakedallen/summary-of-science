In connection with the applications in the field of quantum information [4], seminal\nexperimental results have been reached, such as the implementations of quantum logical gates [5, 6, 7] and the\nrealizations of quantum teleportation [8]. Generation of\nquantum states is a crucial issue in nano-technologies, because it is the basis of initialization processes with which\nmany experimental protocols begin. Incidentally, it also\nprovides the possibility of observing physical systems behaving according to the predictions of quantum mechanics once a nonclassical state has been created.\nRecently, a strategy for the generation of pure quantum states through extraction from arbitrary initial\nstates has been proposed [9, 10]. This procedure is based\non the idea of putting a quantum system in interaction\nwith another one that is repeatedly measured in order to\ninduce a non-unitary evolution which forces the former\nsystem onto a Hilbert subspace. If such a subspace is\none-dimensional, the process reduces to the extraction of\na pure quantum state. For this reason, this procedure has\nbeen addressed as a \"purification\" [4, 11]. On the basis\nof this general scheme, many applications have been proposed: it is possible to extract entanglement [10, 12], and\nthe initialization of multiple qubits would be useful for\nquantum computation [10, 13]; extensions of the scheme\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: bdmilite@fisica.unipa.it\naddress: kazuya.yuasa@ba.infn.it\n\nenable us to establish entanglement between two spatially separated systems via repeated measurements on\nan entanglement mediator [14]; in single trapped ions, the\nextraction of angular-momentum Schr\u00f6dinger-cat states\nhas been proposed [15] and the possibility of steering the\nextraction of pure states through quantum Zeno effect\nhas been predicted [16]. In passing, we mention that\nthe approach here recalled is related to quantum nondemolition measurements [17], introduced for gravitational wave detection [18] and exploited in different physical systems for applications in quantum computation and\ninformation [19] and for quantum state generation in general. For instance, in the context of trapped ions, putting\nthe vibrational degrees of freedom in interaction with the\nelectronic degrees of freedom, and repeatedly measuring\nthe atomic state, it is possible to generate Fock states\nboth in one-dimensional [20] and two-dimensional contexts [21].\nUntil now, the extraction of pure states through repeated measurements has been considered in ideal situations, that is, the evolution is assumed to be unitary except for the change of state by the measurements. In this\npaper, we discuss how the predictions change when the\nsystem is put in interaction with an environment and, as\na consequence, is subject to a non-unitary evolution (even\nbetween two successive measurements), which is assumed\nto be described by a Lindblad-type equation [22]. First\nof all in this paper, we discuss the behavior of a quantum system, whose dynamics is governed by the repeated\nmeasurements represented by projection operators on the\nother system in interaction with the former and by the\ndissipative environmental interaction with the two quantum systems. A criterion for the extraction of pure states\nin the presence of dissipation is derived and a quantum\nsystem composed of two two-level systems (qubits) im-\n\n\f2\nmersed in a common bosonic bath is analyzed as a very\nsimple example. The ability or disability of extracting\npure states for a one qubit system by this scheme is estimated numerically in terms of the purity of the density\noperator.\nThe present paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II,\nthe general aspects of the purification protocol in the\npresence of interaction with an environment are discussed. In Sec. III, a simple model of two mutually interacting two-level systems immersed in a bosonic bath\nis analyzed, and the main differences between the ideal\nsituation (in the absence of dissipation) and the more\nrealistic situation here studied (in the presence of dissipation) are singled out. Finally, some conclusive remarks\nare given in Sec. IV.\nII.\n\nGENERAL FRAMEWORK\nA.\n\nFramework\n\nThe scheme of extraction we study in this paper is\nbased on the idea presented in Ref. [9]. Assume that we\nare interested in preparing a target system, S, into a pure\nstate. To this end, put it in interaction with an ancilla\nsystem, X, which is repeatedly measured and found in\nthe same state, say |\u03a6iX . As a consequence of both the\ninteraction with and the measurements on X, system S\nis subject to a non-unitary dynamics which forces it in a\nsubspace. If the subspace is one-dimensional, the relevant\nstate is extracted. We underline that if a negative result\nis obtained measuring system X (i.e., if the ancilla system\nis found in a state different from the expected one), then\nthe trial can be considered as \"failed\" and the system\nhas to be reset in order to restart the experiment, or\nwe can just continue the process as a new trial with the\ninitial condition given by the result of the unsuccessful\nprojection.\nIn the following, we consider this scheme but in the\npresence of dissipation, in order to examine whether a\npure state can still be extracted. To this end, assume now\nthat both S and X are immersed in a bath, so that the\ndynamics of the whole system S+X between the repeated\nmeasurements is governed by the master equation\nd\u03c1tot\n= L\u03c1tot ,\ndt\n\nL = H + D,\n\n(1)\n\nN\n\u03c1tot (\u03c4, N ) \u221d PM(\u03c4 ) * * * PM(\u03c4 )P\u03c1tot (0) = Vtot\n(\u03c4 )\u03c1tot (0),\n(3)\nwhere\n\nVtot (\u03c4 ) = PM(\u03c4 )P,\n\n(4)\n\nwhich, although rigorously speaking acts on Liouville\nspace [23] of the whole system S+X, is substantially a\nsuperoperator acting on the Liouville space of subsystem S, except for the trivial action on X (i.e. projection\non the state |\u03a6iX ). Therefore, it can be rewritten as\nVtot (\u03c4 ) = V(\u03c4 ) \u2297 P, where V(\u03c4 ) is a superoperator acting\nonly on the Liouville space of S.\nIf the master equation is given in the Lindblad\nform [22], the evolution of S+X in interaction with the\nbath is written down in the Kraus representation [24] as\nM(\u03c4 )\u03c1tot =\n\nG\nX\n\nT\u0302k (\u03c4 )\u03c1tot T\u0302k\u2020 (\u03c4 ),\n\n(5)\n\nk=0\n\nwhere G + 1 is the number of Kraus operators T\u0302k (\u03c4 ) involved in the decay process. Therefore, the superoperator\nV(\u03c4 ) that maps the state of S just after a measurement\nto another after the next measurement reads\nV(\u03c4 )\u03c1 =\n\nG\nX\n\nV\u0302k (\u03c4 )\u03c1V\u0302k\u2020 (\u03c4 ),\n\n(6)\n\nk=0\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the state of S and\nV\u0302k (\u03c4 ) = Xh\u03a6|T\u0302k (\u03c4 )|\u03a6iX\n\n(7)\n\nis an operator acting on the Hilbert space of S. Note that\nthe state of the whole system S+X after a measurement\nis factorized like \u03c1tot = \u03c1 \u2297 |\u03a6iXh\u03a6|.\nThe properties of V(\u03c4 ) determine the fate of the state\nof S, after many repetitions of measurements on X. In\nfact, assume that V(\u03c4 ) is diagonalizable and consider\nits spectral decomposition in terms of its eigenprojections [25]:\nX\nV(\u03c4 ) =\n\u03bbn \u03a0n ,\n(8)\nn\n\nwhere \u03c1tot is the density operator of S+X (the trace over\nthe bath degrees of freedom has already been performed).\nH is the Hamiltonian superoperator defined by H\u03c1tot =\n\u2212i[\u0124, \u03c1tot ], while D is the Lindblad-type dissipator [22]\nwhich takes into account the interaction with the environment, in the Markovian limit. Let M(\u03c4 ) = eL\u03c4 denote\nthe superoperator describing the dissipative dynamics of\nS+X and P the projection superoperator associated with\nthe measurement of the state |\u03a6iX , i.e.\nP\u03c1tot = |\u03a6iXh\u03a6|\u03c1tot |\u03a6iXh\u03a6|.\n\nAssuming that the time elapsed between two successive\nmeasurements is always \u03c4 and that every of the N + 1\nmeasurements has confirmed X to be in the state |\u03a6iX ,\nthe initial state \u03c1tot (0) is mapped into the final one,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03a0n is the eigenprojection belonging to the eigenvalue \u03bbn and satisfies the ortho-normality and completeness conditions\nX\n\u03a0m \u03a0n = \u03b4mn \u03a0n ,\n\u03a0n = 1.\n(9)\nn\n\nThe eigenvalues \u03bbn are complex-valued in general and\nordered in such a way that |\u03bb0 | = |\u03bb1 | = * * * = |\u03bbg0 | >\n|\u03bbg0 +1 | \u2265 |\u03bbg0 +2 | \u2265 * * * . If V(\u03c4 ) is not diagonalizable,\nthe Jordan decomposition applies instead of (8) [25].\n\n\f3\nGeneralization of the following argument to such cases\nis straightforward. See, for instance, an Appendix of\nRef. [10].\nThe evaluation of the N th power of V(\u03c4 ) shows that,\nthe larger the number N of the repeated measurements is,\nthe more dominant the blocks belonging to the maximum\n(in modulus) eigenvalues are over the other blocks. That\nis, for a large enough N , the action of V N (\u03c4 ) diminishes\nthe components of the system density operator which do\nnot belong to the generalized eigenspaces corresponding\nto the maximum (in modulus) eigenvalues. Indeed,\nV N (\u03c4 ) =\n\nX\nn\n\nN \u2192\u221e\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\u03bbN\nn \u03a0n \u2212\n\ng0\nX\n\n\u03bbN\nn \u03a0n ,\n\n(10)\n\nn=0\n\nwhich, in the case wherein only one eigenvalue exists\nwhose modulus is maximum (i.e. when g0 = 0), reduces\nto\nN \u2192\u221e\n\nV N (\u03c4 ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u03bbN\n0 \u03a00 .\n\n(11)\n\nTherefore, in such a case, for a large enough (depending\non the structure of the spectrum) N , the action of V N (\u03c4 )\nessentially reduces to the action of \u03a00 , hence projecting\nthe system in the relevant subspace.\nAs for the outcome state, it is worth mentioning that, if\n\u03bb0 is degenerated, the state of S extracted by \u03a00 depends\non the initial state of S, \u03c1(0), since such a final state is\nsubstantially proportional to \u03a00 \u03c1(0), which depends on\n\u03c1(0) if \u03a00 refers to a multi-dimensional space. On the\ncontrary, if \u03bb0 is not degenerated and \u03a00 refers to a onedimensional subspace, i.e.\n\u03a00 \u03c1 = f0 (\u03c1)\u03c10\n\n(12)\n\nwith \u03c10 the relevant eigenstate (which is an element of\nthe Liouville space of S) and f0 a suitable form on the\nLiouville space of S, the eigenstate \u03c10 is extracted irrespectively of the initial condition of the system, provided\n\u03a00 \u03c1(0) 6= 0. As a first step, in this paper we shall concentrate on such situations wherein there is a single extracted eigenspace which in addition is one-dimensional.\nIn an ideal case wherein any sources of dissipation are\nabsent, Eq. (6) reduces to V(\u03c4 )\u03c1 = V\u03020 (\u03c4 )\u03c1V\u03020\u2020 (\u03c4 ) with\nV\u03020 (\u03c4 ) = Xh\u03a6|e\u2212i\u0124t |\u03a6iX [9], so that, if V\u03020 (\u03c4 ) possesses a\nnondegenerate and unique maximum (in modulus) eigenvalue, then the final state to be extracted is the pure\nstate |u0 iShu0 |, since in this case Eq. (12) is supplemented\nby \u03c10 = |u0 iShu0 | and f0 (\u03c1) = Shv0 |\u03c1|v0 iS where |u0 i\nand hv0 | are the right- and left-eigenvectors of V\u03020 (\u03c4 ) belonging to its largest (in modulus) eigenvalue, respectively. This is the basic idea of the purification scheme\nbased on the repeated measurements, which was first proposed in Ref. [9] and has been analyzed and developed in\nRefs. [10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. On the other hand, it is important to stress that in the non-ideal case, even if there\nis a single and nondegenerate eigenvalue that is maximum in modulus, this does not guarantee that the state\n\u03c10 is a pure state and hence there is no warranty that\n\nthe final extracted state is pure, either. In this sense, our\nstate-extraction scheme may not necessarily be an effective purification scheme. However, we still try to seek\na possibility of extracting a pure state even in the presence of dissipation. The examination of such situations\nwherein we can extract a pure state is the main topic of\nthis paper.\nEfficiency - This scheme for extracting quantum\nstates is a conditional one, in the sense that each time\nsystem X is measured it has to be found in the same\nstate, denoted by |\u03a6iX . In Refs. [9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]\nit is proved that the probability of success of the extraction, that is the probability of finding system X\nin the state |\u03a6iX successively N times, is given by\nthe normalization factor\nP Nof the state extracted by (3),\ntrS {V N (\u03c4 )\u03c1(0)} =\nn \u03bbn trS {\u03a0n \u03c1(0)}, which behaves\nasymptotically\nas\n\u2192\n\u03bbN\n0 trS {\u03a00 \u03c1(0)} as N \u2192 \u221e [or\nP\nN\n\u2192 n\u2264g0 \u03bbn trS {\u03a0n \u03c1(0)} in the more general situation,\nwhich from now on we shall not mention anymore for the\nsake of simplicity]. These expressions for the probability\nof success (still valid in the non-ideal case, provided the\nprojectors \u03a0n are the appropriate ones) show that the\nstructure of the spectrum of V(\u03c4 ) plays a crucial role for\nthe efficiency and fastness of the extraction. In particular, on the one hand, the fact that \u03bb0 has a modulus\nquite larger than those of the other eigenvalues makes\nV N (\u03c4 ) quickly approach \u03bbN\n0 \u03a00 , so that a smaller number\nof measurements is required to well approximate the final result \u03a00 \u03c1(0). On the other hand, the closer to unity\nthe modulus of \u03bb0 is, the greater the probability of success is, approaching just trS {\u03a00 \u03c1(0)} (without decaying\nout completely) for \u03bb0 \u2243 1. On the contrary, for small\nvalues of \u03bb0 , the probability quickly approaches zero like\n\u03bbN\n0 , which means that if a large number of measurements\nis required to approach the state (trS {\u03a00 \u03c1(0)})\u22121 \u03a00 \u03c1(0)\nthe scheme becomes very inefficient. Therefore, the number of measurements necessary to extract the target state\nwould be an important measure of efficiency. It can be\nroughly estimated by the following argument. The idea is\nto see how much the relevant part approaching the target\nstate, \u03bbN\n0 \u03a00 \u03c1(0), dominates over the rest:\np= P\n\n\u03bbN\n0 k\u03a00 \u03c1(0)k\n,\nN\n|\u03bb\nn | k\u03a0n \u03c1(0)k\nn\n\n(13)\n\nwhere\nk * k is a certain norm, for instance kAk :=\np\ntrS {A\u2020 A}. This measure approaches unity in the limit\nof an infinite number of measurements, p \u2192 1 as N \u2192 \u221e.\nThen, we ask how many measurements are necessary for\nthis quantity to exceed a desiredPvalue 0 < p0 < 1. After\nN\nrewriting (13) as \u03bbN\n0 k\u03a00 \u03c1(0)k/( n6=0 |\u03bbn | k\u03a0n \u03c1(0)k) =\np/(1 \u2212 p), a sufficient condition for p \u2265 p0 is given by\n\u03bbN\np0\n0 k\u03a00 \u03c1(0)k\n,\n\u2265\nN\n(M \u2212 1)|\u03bb1 | R(\u03c1(0))\n1 \u2212 p0\n\n(14)\n\nwhere M is the number of eigenvalues or equivalently\nthe dimension of the Liouville space and R(\u03c1(0)) =\n\n\f4\nmaxn6=0 k\u03a0n \u03c1(0)k. The number of measurements necessary to get a better quality than p0 is therefore estimated\nby\nN\u2265\n\nR(\u03c1(0))\nln[p0 /(1 \u2212 p0 )] + ln(M \u2212 1) + ln k\u03a0\n0 \u03c1(0)k\n\nln |\u03bb0 /\u03bb1 |\n\n.\n\n(15)\n\nIt is important to note that this threshold depends on\n\u03c1(0), according to the expectation that the larger is the\nnorm of the relevant part in the initial state, k\u03a00 \u03c1(0)k,\nthe smaller is the number of necessary measurements.\nB.\n\nSearching for Pure Eigenvectors: the Criterion\n\nIt is easy to show that a necessary and sufficient condition for a pure state being an eigenvector of the map\nV(\u03c4 ) is that it is a simultaneous eigenstate of all the operators V\u0302k (\u03c4 ) involved in the relevant map (see Eq. (6)).\nThe proof of this statement proceeds as follows.\n=\u21d2 Obviously, if the state |\u03c6iS is a common eigenstate of all V\u0302k 's, i.e., V\u0302k |\u03c6iS = \u03b1k |\u03c6iS and consequently\n\u2020\n\u2217\nSh\u03c6|V\u0302k = Sh\u03c6|\u03b1k , then one has\nG\nX\n\nk=0\n\nV\u0302k (\u03c4 )|\u03c6iSh\u03c6|V\u0302k\u2020 (\u03c4 ) = \u03bb\u03c6 |\u03c6iSh\u03c6|,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere\n\u03bb\u03c6 =\n\nX\nk\n\n\u03b1\u2217k \u03b1k \u2265 0.\n\n0 = \u03bb\u03c6 Sh\u03c6\u22a5 |\u03c6iSh\u03c6|\u03c6\u22a5 iS\nG\nX\n\nk=0\n\n=\n\nG\nX\n\nk=0\n\n|Sh\u03c6\u22a5 |V\u0302k (\u03c4 )|\u03c6iS |2 ,\n\n(18)\n\nfrom which it follows that Sh\u03c6\u22a5 |V\u0302k (\u03c4 )|\u03c6iS = 0 for all k\nand whatever the state |\u03c6\u22a5 iS is, provided it is orthogonal\nto |\u03c6iS . In other words, it means that\n\u2200k,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere \u03b1k is a suitable complex number. This completes\nthe proof.\n\nThis quantity is upper and lower bounded in accordance\nwith 1/L \u2264 P (\u03c1) \u2264 1 with L being the number of levels of\nthe system under scrutiny. Observe that the maximum\nvalue [P (\u03c1) = 1] corresponds to pure states, while the\nminimum value [P (\u03c1) = 1/L] corresponds to maximally\nmixed states with maximal von Neumann's entropy.\nD.\n\nWeak-Damping Case\n\nIt is possible to derive a formula for the purity of the\nextracted state for general systems in the weak-damping\nregime. Such a formula would be useful for understanding which parameters spoil the purity and convenient for\nan optimization of the purification.\nLet us decompose the relevant map V(\u03c4 ) into two\nparts,\nV(\u03c4 ) = V (0) (\u03c4 ) + \u03b4V(\u03c4 ),\n\n(21)\n\nwhere V (0) (\u03c4 ) is the map in the absence of the environmental perturbation and the rest is treated as a perturbation to it, which is given in the weak-damping regime\nby\nZ \u03c4\n\u03b4V(\u03c4 ) \u2297 P \u2243\ndt PeH(\u03c4 \u2212t) DeHt P.\n(22)\nAssuming that V\u03020 (\u03c4 ) is diagonalizable, let |un iS and\nhv\nS n | denote its right- and left-eigenvectors,\nP respectively,\nwhich form a complete ortho-normal set, n |un iShvn | =\n11S [27]. (We also normalize the right-eigenvectors as\nShun |un iS = 1.) Then, the right-eigenvectors of the ideal\nmap read\n(0)\n(0)\nV (0) (\u03c4 )\u03c3mn\n= \u03bb(0)\nmn \u03c3mn ,\n\nSearching for Pure Eigenvectors: Purity\n\nIn those cases in which we are not able to extract an\nexactly pure state, there is a possibility of extracting \"almost pure\" states, that is, mixed states very close (in the\n\n(0)\n\u03c3mn\n= |um iShun |.\n\n(23)\n\nThese are orthogonal to the left-eigenvectors\n(0)\n\u03c3\u0303mn\n= |vm iShvn |\n\n(24)\n\nin the sense\n(0)\n\nC.\n\n(20)\n\n0\n\n\u2020\nSh\u03c6\u22a5 |V\u0302k (\u03c4 )|\u03c6iSh\u03c6|V\u0302k (\u03c4 )|\u03c6\u22a5 iS\n\nV\u0302k (\u03c4 )|\u03c6iS = \u03b1k |\u03c6iS ,\n\nP (\u03c1) = trS \u03c12 .\n\n(17)\n\n\u21d0= Let the pure state |\u03c6iSh\u03c6| be an eigenvector of\nP\n\u2020\nV(\u03c4 ), then G\nk=0 V\u0302k (\u03c4 )|\u03c6iSh\u03c6|V\u0302k (\u03c4 ) = \u03bb\u03c6 |\u03c6iSh\u03c6|.

To look for almost\npure states which can be extracted, let us recall a measure\nof purity of a given state. We show later how the purity\nof the eigenstate of the linear map V(\u03c4 ) corresponding\nto the maximum eigenvalue behaves as a function of the\nparameters of the scheme, i.e. the interval of time \u03c4 and\nthe repeatedly measured state of X, |\u03a6iX .\nThe purity of a state is defined as the trace of the\nsquare of the relevant (normalized) density operator [26]:\n\n(0)\n(\u03c3\u0303mn\n, \u03c3m\u2032 n\u2032 ) = \u03b4mm\u2032 \u03b4nn\u2032 ,\n\n(A, B) = trS {A\u2020 B}.\n\n(25)\n\nWe are interested in a situation where we can purify S in\nthe absence of the environmental perturbation. That is,\n(0)\n\u03bb00 is not degenerated and is the only eigenvalue that is\nthe largest in modulus.\n\n\f5\nNow, the standard perturbative treatment yields the\nfirst-order correction to the right-eigenvector,\n(1)\n\u03b4\u03c3mn\n=\u2212\n\n(0)\n\nX\n\n\u03c3m\u2032 n\u2032\n\nm\u2032 n\u2032 6=mn\n\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\n(\u03c3\u0303m\u2032 n\u2032 , \u03b4V(\u03c4 )\u03c3mn )\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\n\u03bbm\u2032 n\u2032 \u2212 \u03bbmn\n\n(0)\n+ c \u03c3mn\n,\n\n(26)\n\nwhere the constant c is set equal to zero by the normal(0)\n(1)\n(0)\n(1)\nization condition (\u03c3\u0303mn + \u03b4\u03c3\u0303mn , \u03c3mn + \u03b4\u03c3mn ) = 1.\n(0)\nThis formula is valid when \u03bbmn is not degenerated.\nWe are interested in the state to be extracted, i.e. \u03c10 \u2243\n(0)\n(1)\n(1)\n(0)\n(\u03c300 +\u03b4\u03c300 )/(1+trS \u03b4\u03c300 ). Since \u03bb00 has been assumed\n(1)\nto be nondegenerated, the formula (26) is valid for \u03b4\u03c300 .\nThe purity of \u03c10 up to this order is therefore given by\nP (\u03c10 ) \u2243 1 \u2212\n=1\u2212\n\n(1)\ntrS \u03b4\u03c300\n\n\u0001\n(1)\n2\n\u2212 Shu0 |\u03b4\u03c300 |u0 iS\n(0)\n(0)\nX\n(\u03c3\u0303mn , \u03b4V(\u03c4 )\u03c300 )\n2\n,\nShun |Q\u03020 |um iS\n(0)\n(0)\n\u03bb00 \u2212 \u03bbmn\nmn6=00\n\n(27)\n\nwhere Q\u03020 = 11S \u2212 |u0 iShu0 | is a projection operator.\nThis is the formula for the purity of the extracted state\nup to the first order in the decay constants in the weak(0)\ndamping regime. This shows that, if the state \u03c300 to be\nextracted in the ideal case is an eigenstate of the pertur(0)\n(0)\nbation, i.e. \u03b4V(\u03c4 )\u03c300 \u221d \u03c300 , the first-order correction to\nthe purity vanishes and the purification is robust against\nthe environmental perturbation, at least up to this order. This is a weaker version of the criterion discussed in\nSec. II B and is convenient since the dissipator of a master\nequation, D, suffices to this criterion without knowing the\nKraus operators T\u0302k (\u03c4 ) of the decay process, which may\nrequire solving the master equation. Furthermore, this\nformula would be useful for finding a parameter set that\noptimizes the purity (minimizes the first-order correction\nto the purity).\nWhen S is a two-level system, the formula (27) is reduced to\n(0)\n\nP (\u03c10 ) \u2243 1 \u2212\n\n(0)\n\n2\n(\u03c3\u030311 , \u03b4V(\u03c4 )\u03c300 )\n.\n(0)\n(0)\nShv1 |v1 iS\n\u03bb \u2212\u03bb\n\nidentical two-level atoms subjected to a dipolar coupling.\nAssuming that the matrix elements of the dipole operators are real, and neglecting the counter-rotating terms,\none reaches the following Hamiltonian (for details, see\nRefs.

In order to make s0 (t)\nvanish too, it is necessary to have sin \u03b82 = 0 or cos \u03b82 = 0.\nIn fact, the condition cos \u03b72 = 0 means |\u03c6iS = |\u2193iS , and\nevaluating s0 (t) in such a special situation provides\ns0 (\u03c4 ) = Sh\u2191|Xh\u03a6|T\u03020 (\u03c4 )|\u03a6iX |\u2193iS\n=\u2212\n\n\u03b31\n\u03b8\ne\u2212i\u03c7 e\u2212i(\u03a9\u2212\u01eb)\u03c4\n\u03b8\n\u221a\nsin cos (1 \u2212 e\u2212 2 \u03c4 e\u2212i2\u01eb\u03c4 ),\n2\n2\n2\n(36)\n\nwhich, for \u03c4 6= 0, vanishes only if sin \u03b82 = 0 or cos 2\u03b8 = 0.\nThis analysis shows that in some special cases, that is,\nwhen the state of X is repeatedly measured and found in\n|\u03a6iX = |\u2191iX (sin \u03b82 = 0) or |\u03a6iX = |\u2193iX (cos \u03b82 = 0), the\ncontracted linear map V(\u03c4 ) has the S state |\u2193iSh\u2193| as a\npure eigenstate. To reach the final conclusion about the\npossibility of extracting such a pure state, one needs to\nknow whether the corresponding eigenvalue is the maximum (in modulus) in the spectrum of the map. We\nshall therefore diagonalize the contracted map in the two\ncases, sin 2\u03b8 = 0 and cos 2\u03b8 = 0.\nRepresenting the density operator of S as a\nfour-dimensional vector, \u03c1 = (\u03c1\u2191\u2191 , \u03c1\u2193\u2193 , \u03c1\u2191\u2193 , \u03c1\u2193\u2191 ) =\n(Sh\u2191|\u03c1|\u2191iS , Sh\u2193|\u03c1|\u2193iS , Sh\u2191|\u03c1|\u2193iS , Sh\u2193|\u03c1|\u2191iS ), the contracted\nlinear map V(\u03c4 ) is substantially represented by a 4 \u00d7 4\nmatrix.\nRepeatedly measuring |\u2193iX (\u03b8 = \u03c0) - In the case\nwhere the X state |\u2193iX is repeatedly measured, the corresponding linear map V(\u03c4 ) = V\u2193 (\u03c4 ) is represented by the\nfollowing matrix:\n|f\u2193 (\u03c4 )|2\n\uf8ec 1 (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b31 \u03c4 )\n2\nV\u2193 (\u03c4 ) = \uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n0\n0\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n0 0\n0\n1 0\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n0 f\u2193 (\u03c4 )\n0 \uf8f8\n0 0 f\u2193\u2217 (\u03c4 )\n\nwith f\u2193 (\u03c4 ) = 21 e\u2212i(\u03a9\u2212\u01eb)\u03c4 (1 + e\u2212\nues of this matrix are\n\u03bb0 = 1,\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb\u22172 = f\u2193 (\u03c4 ),\n\n\u03b31\n2\n\n\u03c4 \u2212i2\u01eb\u03c4\n\ne\n\n(37)\n\n).

Then, repeatedly measuring the\nstate |\u2191iX cuts the population of |0itot in the mixture and\nleaves only X h\u2191|sitot hs|\u2191iX \u221d |\u2193iSh\u2193|.\n\u03b32\nThe case e\u2212 2 \u03c4 = |f\u2191 (\u03c4 )| corresponds to a degenerate\ncase and hence, as clarified in Sec. II, is not in the scope\nof this paper since it does not permit the extraction of\na precise state irrespectively of the initial state of the\nsystem.\nNotice that the general case corresponding to measuring a generic state |\u03a6iX can be discussed in the weak\ndamping limit through the perturbation analysis.\n\n(42a)\n\nwith\n\nC.\n\np\u2191\u2191 =\n\n1\n,\n1+\u03b1\n\np\u2193\u2193 = 1 \u2212 p\u2191\u2191 =\n\n\u03b1\n,\n1+\u03b1\n\n\u03b32 (e\u2212\u03b32 \u03c4 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b31 \u03c4 )\n.\n\u03b1=\n2(\u03b31 \u2212 \u03b32 )(e\u2212\u03b32 \u03c4 \u2212 |f\u2191 (\u03c4 )|2 )\n\n(42b)\n(42c)\n\nThe latter is not in contradiction with the previous statement that one has a pure eigenstate for sin 2\u03b8 = 0. Indeed, the state |\u2193iSh\u2193| is still an eigenstate of the map,\nbut it does not correspond to the maximum eigenvalue\nanymore, and then it is not the state to be extracted.\nThe purity of the state \u03c1(II) in (42) is given by\nP (\u03c1(II) ) = p2\u2191\u2191 + p2\u2193\u2193 =\n\n1 + \u03b12\n.\n(1 + \u03b1)2\n\n(43)\n\nIn the weak-damping case \u03b31 \u03c4, \u03b32 \u03c4 \u226a 1 (and assuming\n\u03b32 \u03c4\nsin \u01eb\u03c4 6= 0 for simplicity), one has \u03b1 \u2243 2 sin\n2 \u01eb\u03c4 up to the\nfirst order in \u03b31 \u03c4 and \u03b32 \u03c4 , and hence\nP (\u03c1(II) ) \u2243 1 \u2212 2\u03b1 \u2243 1 \u2212\n\n\u03b32 \u03c4\n.\nsin2 \u01eb\u03c4\n\n(39)\n\n(44)\n\nThis formula, that alternatively can be directly derived\nusing (28), shows that in the weak-damping regime (i)\nthe purity is linearly affected by \u03b32 , while (ii) it is not influenced by \u03b31 . Furthermore, (iii) the purity is optimized\nby taking a nontrivial time interval \u03c4 \u2243 0.37\u03c0/\u01eb.\nIt is worth noting that in the weak damping limit we\ncannot extract a pure state, while in the strong damping limit a pure state can be obtained, which is the opposite one would expect. To understand this fact, consider first of all that S+X has two stable states, |0itot h0|\n\nAt Finite Temperature\n\nThe analysis on the model has so far been focused on\nthe zero-temperature case and showed that the only pure\nstate that can be extracted at the zero temperature is |\u2193iS\nwhen the state of X is repeatedly measured and found in\n|\u2191iX or |\u2193iX . The question of what happens in the case\nof non-zero temperature naturally arises. To answer this\nquestion, we resort to numerical calculations.\nThe linear map V(\u03c4 ) depends on \u03c4 , the measured state\n|\u03a6iX (which is individualized in the Bloch-sphere by the\npolar and azimuthal angles, \u03b8 and \u03c7, respectively), and\nin general the temperature of the environment, T . Given\nthe map, the eigenvector associated with the maximum\neigenvalue, and its purity are functions of all such quantities (\u03c4 , \u03b8, \u03c7 and T ).\nIn Fig. 1, the purity of the state to be extracted is\nshown as a function of the parameters \u03c4 and \u03b8 with \u03c7 = 0\nbeing fixed, in four different situations concerning the\nbath. For the numerical calculations, we have set \u03a9/\u01eb =\n10, \u03b32 /\u01eb = 0.1, and \u03b31 /\u03b32 = 0.95.\nIn Fig. 1(a), the purity of the state to be extracted\nin the ideal situation is plotted, that is, in the absence\nof interaction with the bath. According to the discussion in Sec. II, the purity in such a case is expected to\nbe equal to 1 whatever the parameters \u03c4 , \u03b8 and \u03c7 are.\nIn the other three figures, the behavior of purity in the\npresence of interaction with the bath at different temperatures is shown. Figure 1(b) refers to the case of very\nlow temperature, effectively zero, and shows that in some\nregions of the parameter space, there is a possibility of\nextracting pure or almost pure states.

In all cases, ratios between salient physical quantities are fixed as\n\u03a9/\u01eb = 10, \u03b32 /\u01eb = 0.1, \u03b31 /\u03b32 = 0.95.\n\ntradiction with the analysis in Sec. III B, where it has\nbeen found that a pure state can be extracted only for\n\u03b8 = 0, \u03c0. This result refers to an exactly pure eigenstate,\nwhile the numerical calculations here reported show the\nvalue of purity, which can be very close to unity although\nnot exactly 1.\nIn Fig. 1(c), one can see that in practice there is no region in the parameter space corresponding to pure states:\nthe purity is visibly smaller than unity everywhere. Finally, in Fig. 1(d), we see that at a higher temperature\n(kB T = 10~\u03a9, with kB the Boltzmann constant), the purity of the state to be extracted is equal to the minimum\nvalue for the two-level system, 21 , almost everywhere, that\nis, irrespectively of the values of parameters \u03c4 and \u03b8.\nIn Fig. 2, the purity is plotted as a function of the temperature T and of the time interval \u03c4 between successive\nmeasurements, when a fixed state of system X characterized by \u03b8 = 3\u03c0/4 and \u03c7 = 0 is repeatedly measured. It\nis well visible that the more the temperature increases,\nthe more the purity of the extracted state approaches the\nminimum value, that is, 12 .\nAll these results express in a clear way that the inter-\n\naction with an environment deteriorates the reliability of\nthe purification scheme based on repeated measurements,\nalthough at the zero temperature pure states can still be\nextracted.\n\nD.\n\nEfficiency\n\nIn a realistic situation, the probability of extracting the\ntarget state as well as the number of measurements one\nhas to perform are important factors to consider. According to the discussion at the end of Sec. II A, the probability of success is asymptotically given by \u03bbN\n0 trS {\u03a00 \u03c1(0)}.\nTherefore, except for those situations wherein the maximum eigenvalue (in modulus) is unity, the most relevant condition to get a good efficiency is that the number of required measurements is very low, which implies\n|\u03bb1 /\u03bb0 | \u226a 1, or, better, that the denominator in the\nthreshold given in (15) is high, i.e. ln |\u03bb0 /\u03bb1 | \u226b 1. Therefore, the peaks of ln |\u03bb0 /\u03bb1 | correspond to the maxima\nof the efficiency (i.e., the minima of the required number of measurements).

The plots clearly\nshow that the interaction with a nonzero temperature environment negatively affects the efficiency, lowering the\npeaks and extending the valleys. Nevertheless, at zero\ntemperature, various peaks are still present, and in fact,\nat zero temperature, the degradation with respect to the\nideal case is not so dramatic.\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nLet us summarize the results reported in this paper.\nPutting a system in interaction with a repeatedly measured one forces the former system onto a subspace, hence\nrealizing, under suitable conditions, the extraction of\npure states. In a more realistic situation, the two systems\nare interacting with their environment too, and therefore\nare subjected to dissipation. Such an interaction practically reduces the chance to extract pure states.\nFrom the mathematical point of view, the main difference between the two situations is represented by the\nfact that in the ideal case one extracts eigenvectors of a\nmap onto a Hilbert space, whereas in the non-ideal case\none extracts eigenvectors of a map onto a Liouville space.\n\nWe have explored the general framework and studied a\nvery simple physical system (two spins interacting with\na bosonic bath) in order to bring to light fundamental\nfeatures of repeated-measurement based extraction processes in the presence of dissipation. In Sec. III B, we\nhave shown that a mixed state is extracted instead of\na pure state. Actually, this is what generally happens,\nespecially at high temperatures. Nevertheless, with a\nzero-temperature bath, it is still possible to extract pure\nand almost pure states (see Fig. 1(b)) with still fairly\ngood efficiency. Indeed, the efficiency, though negatively\naffected by the environment, is still good at zero temperature.\nOverall, we have considered the case wherein a very\nlarge number of measurements (evaluating the mathematical limit for an infinite number of measurements) is\nperformed on the ancilla system, as clearly expressed by\n(10) and (11). We conclude this paper expecting that in\nsome cases a reduction of the number of measurements\nperformed on the ancilla system entails an increase of\nthe purity of the output state. See, for example, Fig. 4,\nwherein we have plotted the purity of the resulting quantum state as a function of the number of measurements\nperformed on the ancilla system, starting from the maximally mixed initial state, with a particular parameter set.\nIt is well visible that the purity, starting from its minimum value ( 12 ), increases at the second measurement,\nand then decreases down to its asymptotic value. Therefore, in such a case, the highest value of purity is obtained\nfor a smaller number of measurements (N = 2). We will\ndiscuss this aspect of our scheme in the next future.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work is partly supported by the bilateral ItalianJapanese Projects II04C1AF4E on \"Quantum Information, Computation and Communication\" of the Italian\nMinistry of Education, University and Research, and\n15C1 on \"Quantum Information and Computation\" of\nthe Italian Ministry for Foreign Affairs, by the Grant\nfor The 21st Century COE Program at Waseda University and the Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B)\n(No. 18740250) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan, and by the\nGrants-in-Aid for JSPS Postdoctoral Fellowship for Foreign Researchers (Short-term) and for Scientific Research\n(C) (No. 18540292) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.
