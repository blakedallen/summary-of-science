Quantum information is\nencoded in the polarization degrees of freedom and is therefore not affected by the measurement.\nSome implementations of the QND measurement are proposed.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nPhotons are the information carriers in linear optical\nquantum information processing devices [1, 2]. Information is encoded in the state of the photon (e.g., photon\nnumber or polarization), and the processing is accomplished by sending the photon through a system of linear\noptical elements and using photodetectors to measure the\noutcome. The photons are usually routed through optical fibers or waveguides, that can transmit them from\none part of the device to another and act as delay lines\nor even as primitive memories, by letting the photon go\naround a loop of fiber. This useful property of a fiber as\na transmission line has its origin in the interaction between the photon and the atoms in the fiber. However,\nthis interaction has the undesirable side effect of photon\nabsorption, which introduces errors in the quantum information processing. Thus it has been an active area of\nresearch to develop new approaches to suppress photon\nabsorption in optical processors [3].\nSince we cannot amplify a quantum signal, our efforts\nshould be aimed at preventing its degradation due to the\nloss of photons caused by the interaction between the\nfiber and the electromagnetic field. For this purpose, we\npropose to use the well-known Quantum Zeno effect [4],\nwhich has already been applied to quantum information\nprocessing [5]. To understand the idea we note that this\nloss of photons can be viewed as the evolution of a quantum state in which the initial state contains one photon\nand, due to the interaction between the photon and the\nfiber, is transformed into a state in which the photon has\nbeen absorbed. The Quantum Zeno effect tells us that by\nfrequently monitoring the presence of the photon we can\ninhibit this evolution, and hence prevent the photon from\nbeing absorbed by the fiber. It may seem rather strange\nthat we propose to preserve the quantum information\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: Federico.Spedalieri@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nencoded in the system by measuring it, since measurement usually destroy quantum coherence. The key idea\nis to encode the information in the polarization degrees\nof freedom of the photon, while performing a quantum\nnon-demolition measurement only on the photon number. In this way no information about the polarization\nstate is acquired, but frequently registering the photon\npresence prevents it from being absorbed.\n\nII.\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nTo simplify our discussion, we will couch our argument\nin terms of single photon loss in telecom fibers. However,\nthe scheme applies to loss in any type of linear optical\nquantum information processor.\nTo start our analysis we first need to identify the physical mechanisms that produce photon loss on a fiber. At\nthe usual telecom wavelength of 1.55\u03bcm, there are two\nmain loss mechanisms whose deleterious effect on the\nphoton transport have approximately the same magnitude: (i) the Rayleigh scattering of photons on the inhomogeneities of the refractive index along the fiber; (ii)\nthe absorption of photons due to their interaction with\nthe vibrational excitations (phonons) [6]. In principle,\nthe effect of Rayleigh scattering can be lowered by improving construction to minimize the inhomogeneities in\nthe fiber [7]. On the other hand, the interaction with\nphonons will always be present, and hence it is useful to\ndesign a procedure to reduce its effects.\nOur goal then is to analyze the interaction between\nthe signal photon and the phonons in the fiber, and show\nthat we can prevent the loss of the photon due to this\ninteraction. For this purpose we consider the following\nHamiltonian\nH = Hsignal + Hbath + Hint ,\n\n(1)\n\nP\nwhere Hsignal =\nh\u0304\u03c9k a\u2020k ak is the Hamiltonian of\nP\nthe propagating signal photon, Hbath =\nh\u0304\u03c9i ri\u2020 ri\n\n\f2\nis the Hamiltonian of the phonon bath, and Hint =\nP\n\u2020\n\u2217 \u2020\nik (gik ak ri + gik ak ri ), is the interaction Hamiltonian.\nThe precise form of Hint is not essential to understand\nthe idea behind our scheme, although it is important in\ndetermining the regime of validity of this proposal.\nThe signalPwill consist of a photon pulse of the form\n|\u03c8signal i =\nk f (k)|1k i(\u03b1|Hi + \u03b2|V i), where |Hi and\n|V i represent horizontal and vertical polarizations respectively. The quantum information carried by the signal is encoded in the values of the coefficients \u03b1 and \u03b2.\nThe function f (k) is chosen such that the pulse has a\nfinite spatial extent and the mean number of photons in\nthe pulse is 1.\nThe initial state of the photon and the fiber can be\nwritten as |\u03a8it=0 = |\u03c8signal i|\u03c6bath i, where |\u03c6bath i is the\ninitial state of the phonons in the fiber. To simplify\nthe notation, let us assume that initially the we have no\nphonons in the fiber, so we have |\u03c6bath i = |000 * * * i. As\nthe pulse propagates, the interaction part of the Hamiltonian will entangle the photons with the phonon in the\nfiber. At some later time t, the state of the system will\nhave the form\n!\nX\n|\u03a8(t)i =\nf (k, t)|1k i(\u03b1|Hi + \u03b2|V i) |000 * * * i +\nk\n\n+\n\nX\nj\n\nc0j (t)|0iphoton |0 * * * |{z}\n1 0 * * * i.\n\n(2)\n\nj th mode\n\nThe first sum represents the free propagation of the photon, while the second sum shows that the photon can be\nabsorbed only by creating a phonon in one of the modes\nof the fiber. To find the time dependent functions f (k, t)\nand c0j (t) we can insert (2) into the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nand solve the resulting differential equations. However,\nthis will not be necessary for our particular purpose.\nOur goal is to use the Quantum Zeno effect to suppress\nthe absorption of the photon due to its interaction with\nthe phonons in the fiber. This is accomplished by performing frequent quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements of the photon number of the pulse. If we measure the photon number at time t = \u03c4 and the outcome\nis 1, then the state of the system after the measurement\nis given by\n!\nX\n|\u03a8(\u03c4 )i =\nf (k, \u03c4 )|1k i(\u03b1|Hi + \u03b2|V i) |000 * * * i.\nk\n\n(3)\nSince the photon number QND measurement does not\naffect the polarization degrees of freedom, the quantum\ninformation carried by them is not affected by the measurement. This is the key idea of our proposal. The state\nin Eq. (3) is the new initial condition to be propagated\nfor another interval \u03c4 until the next QND measuremnet. Note that this initial condition might be different\nfrom the one at t = 0, since the functions f (k, \u03c4 ) might\ndiffer from the functions f (k)|t=0 . However this is not\na problem, because the quantum information carried by\nthe pulse is independent of its form.\n\nThe Quantum Zeno effect tells us that these frequent\nQND photon number measurements can prevent photon\nabsorption. To see how this works, let Ps (t) be the survival probability of the photon pulse at time t as it propagates through\nthe fiber. From Eq. (2) we have that\nP\nPs (t) = k |f (k, t)|2 . Due to the unitarity of quantum\nevolution, is a well-known fact that this survival probability must follow a quadratic decay for small values of t.\nIf the system is interacting with a continuum of modes,\nit is also well-known that this decay becomes exponential\nfor longer times. The time scale at which the transition\noccurs between these two regimes strongly depends on\nthe details of the interaction and the physical properties\nof the interacting systems. We will come back to this\npoint later. For now let us analyze the effects of frequent\nmeasurements during the quadratic decay. Let \u03c4 be the\ntime interval between measurements. The survival probability at time \u03c4 will be given by Ps (\u03c4 ) \u2243 1 \u2212 (\u03b3\u03c4 )2 , for\nsome constant \u03b3. With probability Ps (\u03c4 ) the outcome of\nthe photon munber QND measurement is 1, and we know\nwith certainty that the pulse has exactly 1 photon after\nthe measurement. This pulse evolves again for a time \u03c4 ,\nand the probability of it containing exactly 1 photon is\nagain given by Ps (\u03c4 ). After performing N QND masurements separated by intervals \u03c4 , the probability of survival\nat time T = N \u03c4 is given by\n\u0001N\nPs (T ) = 1 \u2212 (\u03b3\u03c4 )2\n\u0013N\n\u0012\nT \u03c4 \u03b32\n= 1\u2212\nN\n\u2243 e\u2212(\u03b3\n\n2\n\n\u03c4 )T\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere we considered the large N limit on the last line. We\nsee that the decay is still exponential, but the decay rate\ndepends of the parameter \u03c4 . By choosing smaller values\nof \u03c4 (i.e., increasing the frequency of the measurements),\nwe can suppress the decay rate and hence diminish the\nprobability of the photon being absorbed.\nTo apply this idea to the problem of photon loss, we\nconsider the usual telecom fiber and insert a QND measurement devices at regular intervals. Since the succesful\napplication of the Quantum Zeno effect requires that successive measurements be made while the decay of the survival probability is quadratic, and this occurs for times\nshorter than a certain value Tq , the QND devices must be\nplaced such that the distance between them is less than\nvf Tq , where vf is the velocity of the pulse in the fiber.\nThe time scale given by Tq is an important parameter\nin our proposal since it determines how close together\nthe QND devices must be inserted along the fiber. A\ncalculation of this value from first principles appears to\nbe a daunting task, since it will depend crucially on the\ndetails of the photon-phonon interaction, and in particular on the exact form of the density of phononic modes\non the fiber. A simplified calculation of this time scale is\nhighly dependent on the approximations used to model\nthe density of states, giving answers that differ by several orders of magnitude [3]. This suggests that this type\n\n\f3\nof calculation would not be reliable unless the density\nof modes is known with great detail. However this time\nscale should not be difficult to measure. To that end we\npropose the following simple experiment: measure the\nsingle photon loss for different lengths of fiber, starting\nwith a length for which exponential decay of the output\nsignal has been established, and repeat the experiment\nfor shorter lengths until a departure from the exponential\ndecay is observed. That will happen about the time scale\ngiven by Tq , for which the decay becomes quadratic.\nIt is interesting to note that the same idea we used\nto enhance the transmission of quantum information\nthrough a fiber or other linear optical quantum information processor, can be used to design an improved memory device for optical quantum computation. Instead of\ninserting many QND devices along a transmission line,\nwe can just insert only one device on a loop of fiber.\nAgain by encoding the quantum information on the polarization degrees of freedom of the signal pulse and performing a QND measurement of the photon number, we\ncan suppress the absorption of the pulse by the fiber, and\nhence increase the time we can store the quantum information in the fiber. This alternative use could be viable\neven if the transmission application turns out not to be\npractical because it requires too many QND devices.\n\nIII.\n\nQND DEVICES\n\nQND device exists that can be adopted for the present\nscheme. Munro et al. [8] have proposed a high-efficiency\nQND single photon number resolving detector based on\ncross-Kerr nonlinearity obtainable through EIT. To illustrate its mechanism, we note that the QND Hamiltonian\ncan be written as HQND = h\u0304\u03c7 s\u2020 s p\u2020 p , where s and p\nare the ladder operators for the signal and probe fields\nrespectively. The input signal in a fock state |ns i can be\ndetected non-destructively through the phase acquired\nby a coherent probe field |\u03b1p i:\n\u2020\n\n|\u03a8(t)out i = ei\u03c7ts\n\ns p\u2020 p\n\n|ns i|\u03b1p i = |ns i|\u03b1p eins \u03c7t i .\n\nThus, a momentum quadrature measurement on the\nprobe field through an efficient homodyne device ascertains the presence of the signal photon non-destructively.\nThis Kerr-nonlinearity based QND device can be\nimplemented through a 4-level EIT scheme shown in\nFig. 1(a). The atomic medium starts in the initial state\n|1i and remains in that state after the interaction with\nthe signal except of an overall phase acquired by the\nprobe according to Eq. (5). A momentum-quadrature\nmeasurement is performed on the probe field to reveal the\npresence of the signal photon non-dectructvely. Munro\net al. [8] carry out a detailed analysis of this four level\nscheme and obtain various conditions necessary for efficient QND measurement on the signal photon.\n(a)\n\n(b)\n|4i\n\nWe will now present a few ideas for the implementation of the QND device required by our proposal. First,\nlet us note that we only need a QND photon number\nmeasuring device that can distinguish between 1 and 0\nphotons. We do not need it to be able to discriminate for\nhigher photon number, since our signal pulse will be constructed such that it contains only one photon. Then, a\nsimple CNOT gate acting on the {|0i, |1i} subspace and\none ancilla mode are sufficient to implement the QND\nmeasurement. If we prepare the ancilla in the |0i state,\nand use it as the target of a CNOT gate controlled by\nthe presence or absence of a photon in the fiber, by measuring the ancilla we can determine whether the gate has\nbeen applied or not, and hence whether there was a photon in the fiber or not. We can even apply the KLM [1]\nscheme that uses linear optical elements to implement\nthe CNOT gate. This implementation of the gate is\nnon-deterministic but, its probability of success can be\nboosted arbitrarily close to unity by adding more and\nmore ancillas.\nWe now proceed to give possible implementations for\nthe QND device in quantum optical systems. Strong\nnonlinearities are essential to achieve a non-destructive\nmeasurement of the photon number state. Such strong\nnonlinearities can be attained through either atomic coherence effects, for example, electromagnetically induced\ntransparency (EIT) or strong atom-field interaction obtained in the cavity-QED schemes.\nAn interesting proposal for implementation of the\n\n(5)\n\n|2i\n\n\u03a9d\n\n|4i \u2261 |f4, 0i\n|2i \u2261 |f2, \u22121i\n\n|2\u2032i \u2261 |f2, 1i\n\n\u03a9p\n\n\u03a9s\n|3i\n|1i\n\n|3i \u2261 |f3, 0i\n|1i \u2261 |F, mF i = |f1, 0i\n\nFIG. 1: EIT based QND device (level schemes): (a) A general\n4-level scheme: QND measurement of a green signal photon\n(\u03a9s ) is achieved through a phase quadrature measurement\nof the highly-detuned blue probe field (\u03a9p ). The strong red\ndriving field (\u03a9d ) facilitates EIT. (b) Level scheme for the\npolarization-insensitive QND device: The levels are denoted\nby a pair of hyperfine quantum numbers as |F, mF i. The\ncolor code for various fields is the same as in (a). Probe and\ndrive fields are linearily polarized to facilitate extraction of the\nphoton number of the signal photon immaterial of its linear\nor circular polarization state.\n\nIt is, however, important to note that the Munro\nscheme, when applied to an actual atomic system, would\ndepend on and affect the polarization state of the signal\nphoton. For the success of our proposal the QND device\nshould be insensitive to the polarization of the incoming\nphoton. Moreover, the measurement process should neither change this polarization state nor leave its imprint\non the atom or the probe.\nWe note that radiative atomic transitions couple to\na specific polarization states of light and devise an implementation of a polarization-insensitive QND device\nusing hyperfine sublevels of a certain atom as shown\n\n\f4\nin Fig. 1(b). It can be easily seen that model in\nFig. 1(b) has two level schemes of Fig. 1(a) (namely\n|1i \u2212 {|2i , |2\u2032 i} \u2212 |3i \u2212 |4i) embeded in it. We require the\ndrive and probe fields to be linearily polarized. Thus,\nthe drive field couples to both |2i \u2212 |3i and |2\u2032 i \u2212 |3i\ntransitions according to the hyperfine-transition selection\nrules. This is possible because linearily polarized field\ncan be represented as a superposition of equal-magnitude\nleft- and right-circularly polarized components. Similarly, through appropriate choice of hyperfine quantum\nnumbers, the linearily polarized probe field can be set\nto couple a single |3i \u2212 |4i transition. It can be easily\nseen that the probe field would not carry any information about the polarization of the signal photon as the\noscillator strengths of |1i \u2212 |2i and |1i \u2212 |2\u2032 i transitions\nare the same. Thus, immaterial of the polarization state\nof the incoming photon (linearily or circularly polarized)\nthe level scheme of Fig. 1(b) would respond to it in the\nsame way and a quadrature measurement on the probe\nwould neither disturb nor reveal this state.\nIt can be noted that the level scheme used in Fig. 1(b)\nis fairly general, as the values for the quantum number\nF , namely f1 , f2 , f3 , and f4 , are unspecified and only\nthe specific mF values are assumed. One can come up\nwith various examples of atoms that have level-scheme\nmatching the one proposed here. A detailed analysis\nof this scheme will be carried out elsewhere [9]. It is\nuseful to note that such a polarization-insensitive QND\ndevice could be realized in variety of systems including\ncold atomic clouds, single alkali atom trapped in a high-Q\ncavity and rare earth doped telecommunication fiber.\nFurthermore, we note that the quantum phase gate\n(|c, ti \u2192 exp(i\u03c6\u03b4c,1 \u03b4t,1 ) |c, ti with a phase shift (\u03c6 = \u03c0)\nand single qubit rotations (on |ti) could be combined to\nperform a CNOT operation |c, ti \u2192 |c, c \u2295 ti, where |ci\nand |ti are the control and target qubits respectively.\nThis opens up another powerful possibility for the implementation of the QND device, through the CNOT gate,\nbased on well developed tools of cavity-QED. There are\nboth experimental [10] and theoretical [11] proposals for\nrealizing a quantum phase gate in cavity-QED systems\nfor photonic qubits. One can easily adopt these techniques by coupling the signal photon to the cavity to\nperform the role of the control qubit. Once again the\n\nmain requirement would be to make these schemes insensitive to the polarization of the signal photon.\nThe cavity-QED techniques can be easily extended to\nthe regime of fiber optics by replacing the bulky superconducting cavities by either Fabry-Perot cavities, which\nare much easier to integrated into the telecommunication fiber, or the microresonators, which can be easily\ncoupled to the fiber through the evanescent field of the\nsignal photon. To note, Kimble's group at caltech has\ndone a lot of work on extending cavity-QED to both the\nFabry-Perot cavities and microresonators [12].\nIn this letter we have presented a new scheme to enhance the transmission of quantum information through\nlinear optical quantum information processing systems\nby taking advantage of the Quantum Zeno effect. We\npropose encoding the quantum information in the polarization degrees of freedom of the photon. To overcome\nthe losses due to absorption of the photon by the fiber, we\npropose to frequently monitor the presence of the photon by performing a QND measurement of the photon\nnumber. Due to the Quantum Zeno effect, this procedure can supress the absorption if the measurements are\nperformed frequently enough. The quantum information\ncarried by the photon is not disturbed since the polarization state is not affected by the QND photon number\nmeasurement. We also presented some possible implementations of this QND measurement, and proposed an\nexperimental method to determine how often the measurements should be performed. This scheme could also\nbe used as a memory, by preventing a photon stored in a\nloop of fiber from being absorbed, hence preserving the\nquantum information it carries for a longer time.\nThis research has been carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
