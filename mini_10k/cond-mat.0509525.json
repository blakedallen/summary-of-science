A. Maksimov\n\narXiv:cond-mat/0509525v1 [cond-mat.other] 20 Sep 2005\n\nKurchatov Institute, Moscow 123182, Russia\nWithin the framework of the variational approach the ground state is studied in a gas of Fermi\natoms near the Feshbach resonance at negative scattering length. The structure of the originating\nsuperfluid state is formed by two coherently bound subsystems. One subsystem is that of quasi\nmolecules in the closed channel and the other is a system of pairs of atoms in the open channel.\nThe set of equations derived allows us to describe the properties of the ground state at an arbitrary\nmagnitude of the parameters. In particular, it allows one to find a gap in the spectrum of singleparticle Fermi excitations and sound velocity characterizing a branch of collective Bose excitations.\nPACS numbers: 03.75.Kk, 74.20.Mn, 67.60.-g\n\nRecently, the trend of investigations, associated with\nultracold gases of Fermi atoms and Bose molecules generated on their base, has been established and actively\ndeveloped. The key point here is a use of the Feshbach\nresonance for the pair interaction of low-energy Fermi\nparticles. The dependence of the resonance position on\nsteady magnetic field B has given a unique opportunity\nfor continuous variation of the effective interparticle interaction and for the change its sign (sign of scattering\nlength a) with variation of magnetic field [1].\nSeveral stages of studies in that field elapsed for a relatively short time interval. At the first stage there is\ndemonstrated a production of ultracold molecules 40 K2\n[2] and 6 Li2 [3], [4], [5] in the vicinity of the Feshbach\nresonance at magnitudes B corresponding to the positive scattering length and, thus, existence of the genuine bound state near the dissociation threshold. In both\ncases the resonance occurs in the channel of S-scattering.\nFor fermions polarized over electron spin, this supposes\nthe interaction of non-identical atoms in different hyperfine states.\nIt is found that the molecules produced live relatively\nlong in such excited state. This supposes a possibility\nfor the quasi adiabatic transition with variation of field\nB from the state with a < 0 in which genuine molecules\ndo not form into the state with a > 0 and vice versa.\nThe nature for suppression of inelastic processes during\ncollisions with the transition of molecules to deeper levels\nis explained consistently in [6].\nThe conservation of molecules at one vibrational level\nfacilitates the conditions for Bose-Einstein condensation\n(BEC) in originating gas of composite bosons. In the explicit form the condensation of excited molecules is discovered in a gas of atoms 40 K [7] as well as in 6 Li [8],\n[9], [10].\nThe greatest interest in this field is connected with\nthe study of Fermi atoms near the Feshbach resonance\nat magnetic fields corresponding to the scattering length\na < 0.\nA possibility to choose the parameters, converting rarefied gas into the system of strongly interacting particles with the simultaneous lack of real molecules, makes\n\nan analysis of many-particle superfluid state, which appears in these conditions, especially interesting. For the\nfirst time, the question on the use of the Feshbach resonance for achieving superfluidity in a ultracold gas of\nFermi atoms is discussed in [11], [12]. The problem\nof reconstructing the superfluid state in the course of\nthe transition from the weak attraction to the strong\none is considered earlier in the known papers [13], [14].\nThe interaction had a single channel character and the\nspin configuration remained unchanged. The specific feature of the Feshbach resonance lies in the two-channel\ncharacter of the interaction. Particles in the continuous spectrum interact via the formation of the intermediate quasi-molecule state in the other spin configuration. A snapshot fixes a two-component character of the\nsystem with pairs of particles in the quasi-molecular or\nunbound states. A dynamic coherent exchange realizes\nbetween two subsystems, providing permanency in equilibrium at the amplitude level of the population for the\nquasi-molecular state (decaying in vacuum). The coherent superposition of the quasi-molecular states and pairs\nof atoms in the continuous spectrum provides the formation of the superfluid state with the unified condensate.\nFor the first time, the picture of such state is revealed\nexperimentally at first in gas 40 K [15] and then in gas\n6\nLi [16]. The idea of experiment is in the adiabatic projection of the a < 0 state onto the genuine molecular\nstate with a > 0 due to sufficiently rapid variation of\nfield B, preventing from the formation of the condensate\nin the course of the transition. Special measurements\nhave confirmed the latter assumption, see, in particular,\nrecent paper [17]. The experimental results in this field\nhave stimulated the appearance of a series of theoretical works [18],[19],[20],[21],[22] with the attempt of the\nmicroscopic description of the strongly interacting Fermi\natoms, employing, however, one or another variants of\nthe perturbation theory.\nThe present work is devoted to finding the ground state\nof the interacting Fermi atom system near the Feshbach\nresonance at a < 0 within the framework of variational\napproach. As a result, there appears an opportunity for\nunified description of the ground state at an arbitrary\n\n\f2\nrelation of parameters.\nA choice of the macroscopic variational function \u03a80\nreflects the fact that the ground state of the system in\nthe vicinity of the Feshbach resonance is a unified state\nformed in essence by two coherently bound subsystems,\nnamely, subsystem of Fermi atoms in the BCS-like state\nand subsystem of Bose quasi-molecules in the condensate state. In addition, \u03a80 contains the states of quasimolecules with nonzero momentum of the gravity center k 6= 0 and those of pairs of atoms with nonzero\ntotal momentum. This allows from the very beginning\nto involve abovecondensate excited states (temperature\nT = 0), which play a noticeable role during the formation of the ground state, into the variational procedure.\nThe system of equations obtained gives an opportunity,\nin particular, to find a gap in the spectrum of single particle excitations and velocity of sound characterizing a\nbranch of collective Bose excitations and, thus, to determine the critical velocity.\nIn the present work we give a solution of this set of\nequations in explicit form for the limiting cases which\nallow an analytical solution. We restrict ourselves with\nan assumption of the smallness of the resonance coupling\nconstant. The numerical solution in the general case will\nbe given elsewhere.\nTo make analysis more transparent, we consider the\nuniform system. The exchange between the subsystems\nof Fermi atoms and quasi-molecules with the conservation of the total number of atoms determines the appearance of a single chemical potential \u03bc. The generalized\nHamiltonian of the system can be written as\n\u0124 \u2032 = \u0124 \u2212 \u03bcN\u0302 =\n\nX\n\n\u03bep \u00e2+\np\u03c3 \u00e2p\u03c3 +\n\np,\u03c3\n\nX\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u03b6k b\u0302+\nk b\u0302k + V\u0302 + V\u0302a + V\u0302a .\n\nk\n\n(1)\nHere \u00e2p\u03c3 is the annihilation operator of Fermi atom in\nthe open channel, \u03c3 = 1, 2 identifies the hyperfine state of\nan atom in the binary mixture and b\u0302k is the annihilation\noperator of quasi-molecules.\n\u03bep = ~2 p2 /2m \u2212 \u03bc, \u03b6k = \u03b60 + ~2 k 2 /4m, \u03b60 = \u03b50 \u2212 2\u03bc,\nwhere \u03b50 is a position of the resonance level in the closed\nchannel, m is the atom mass (we neglect a difference between hyperfine energies in states 1 and 2).

The single distinction is in the involvement of interaction (4) which\nrole can be noticeable in the general case. Strictly speaking, in Hamiltonian (1) the terms with the nonresonance\ninteraction of atoms with quasi-molecules and between\nquasi-molecules are omitted. However, both these interactions are produced by the resonance interaction (2).\nThe many-particle variational function is taken in the\nform\n\u03a80 = \u03a8\u0302M \u03a8\u0302\u2032M \u03a8\u0302A |0i\n\n(5)\n\nThe field operator of atoms has a usual representation\nY\u0002\n\u0003\n+\nup + vp \u00e2+\n\u03a8\u0302A =\np,1 \u00e2\u2212p,2\np\n\nIn the coherent representation the field operator of quasimolecules in the state k = 0 has the form\n\u0011\n\u0010p\n1\n\u03a8\u0302M = e\u2212 2 M0 exp\nM0 b\u0302+\n0\n\nIt is assumed that the number of such quasi-molecules\nM0 is large.\nA special feature of the structure for the manyparticle variational function (5) is an involvement of the\nstates connected with virtual production of excited quasimolecules. The corresponding operator is represented as\nY\nX\n\u03a8\u0302\u2032M =\n[Fk + Gk\nb\u0302+\nk \u00e2k/2\u2212p,2 \u00e2k/2+p,1 ]\np\n\nk6=0\n\nNote that the order of operators in (5) is essential. Operator \u03a8\u0302\u2032M acts on the the state resulted from the action\nof operator \u03a8\u0302A on the vacuum. The normalization of\nfunction (5) results in two relations\nu2p + vp2 = 1, Fk2 + wk G2k = 1,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere\nV\u0302 = g\n\nX\n\n(b\u0302+\nk \u00e2k/2\u2212p,2 \u00e2k/2+p,1\n\n+\n\n+\n\u00e2+\nk/2+p,1 \u00e2k/2\u2212p,2 b\u0302k )\n\n(2)\n\np,k\n\ncorresponds to the exchange resonance coupling between\nparticles in the open and closed channels.

The direct calcuexp(\u22122zp ) where zp = k G2k vp2 vp\u2212k\nlations show that magnitude zp proves to be small compared with unity, at least, in the region of parameters\ninteresting for us. The involvement of these factors practically has no influence on the results of the variational\nprocedure.

For definiteness,\nhenceforth we put g > 0.\n\n2up vp =\n\n(14)\n\nThen the equation for the gap \u2206 reads\np\n1 X \u2206\n= g M0\n\u2206 + U0\n2\nEp\np\n\n(15)\n\nAt the same time equation (13) goes over into\n1 X \u2206\n1\n\u03b50 \u2212 2\u03bc = g \u221a\n2\nM0 p Ep\n\n(16)\n\nIt is interesting that the role of virtual excited quasimolecules in (15) and (16) is reduced to the renormalization of the atom spectrum, see, (12) and (14).\nSolving equation (10) with (6) allows us directly to find\n\nG2k\n\n1\n=\n(1 \u2212\n2wk\n\ns\n\n\u03b6k2\n\n\u03b6k2\n)\n+ 4g 2 wk\n\n(17)\n\nEquations (15) and (16) contains formally an integral diverging at the upper limit. This divergency is related\nwith the character of introducing parameters \u03b50 , g and\nU0 into Hamiltonian (1). In the general case this requires\nthe introduction an upper cutoff for the momentum region region in which the interaction realizes effectively.\nHowever, in some important cases such cutoff arises in\nthe natural way.\nLet us consider the most interesting case when the resonance interaction U0 = 0 is determining. Then from Eq.\n(15) we have\np\n(18)\n\u22060 = g M0\nThe magnitude \u03b50 in Hamiltonian (1) corresponds to the\nposition of the resonance level. At g 6= 0 the level renormalizes even in the limit of density tending to zero, i.e.,\nin vacuum. In this limit this can straightforwardly be\ntraced by calculating the scattering amplitude for a pair\nof atoms with zero total momentum which is determined\nby interaction (2). Summing a series of the perturbation\ntheory at E \u2192 0, we obtain, (cf. [22]),\n\u221a\n~s/ m\nm3/2 2\n\u221a , s=\nf (E) = \u2212\ng\nP\n\u22121\n1 2\n4\u03c0~3\nE \u2212 \u03b50 + 2 g\np \u03b5p + is E\n\nIt is seen that the resonance level energy at g 6= 0 renormalizes and takes the value\n1 X 1\n\u03b5\u03030 = \u03b50 \u2212 g 2\n2\n\u03b5p\np\n\n\f4\nIn the many-particle problem it is natural to treat magnitude \u03b5\u03030 as P\na real position of the resonance level. Subtracting 12 g 2 p \u03b51p from the both sides of (16) and taking\n(18) into account, we have\n\u03b5\u03030 \u2212 2\u03bc =\n\n1\n1 2X 1\n\u2212 )\ng\n(\n2\nEp\n\u03b5p\np\n\n(19)\n\nProvided that the nonresonance interaction is involved,\nthe situation becomes more complicated. However, treating (15) and (16) jointly, we find the equation which again\ndoes not contain divergency\n\u03b5\u03030 \u2212 2\u03bc =\n\n1 2X 1\n1\ng 2 (\u2206 \u2212 \u22060 )2\n\u2212 )\u2212\ng\n(\n2\nEp\n\u03b5p\nU0\n\u2206\u22060\np\n\n(20)\n\nIf one employs the known relation between U0 and nonresonance scattering length abg beyond the Born approximation, see [23], the gap equation (15) can be transformed as\nX 1\np\n1 4\u03c0~2\n1\n\u2206+ \u2206\n\u2212 ) = g M0\nabg\n(\n2\nm\nEp\n\u03b5p\np\n\n(21)\n\nFor g = 0, this equation reduces to the one familiar in\nthe theory of superconductivity, see [13]. Assuming that\nthe gas parameter is small for the purely nonresonance\ninteraction, U0 in (20) and (12) can be replaced with\n4\u03c0~2 abg /m. Solving equations (20), (21) and (17) together with (6), (12) and (14), we find values \u2206, M0 , G2k\nas a function of chemical potential \u03bc for fixed g, abg , and\n\u03b5\u03030 .

It is worthwhile to\nnote that the system of equations obtained holds only\n\nfor the interval of variation \u03b50 /2\u03b5t in which condition\nM0 \u226b 1 conserves.\nLet us make an important remark. In the strongly interacting many-particle system the superpositional character of the ground state near the Feshbach resonance\nmakes the definitions atoms and molecules relatively conditional. In fact, this is projections of the many-particle\nwave function onto the corresponding states.\nIn the present paper we give a solution of the system\nof equations obtained in some limiting cases which allow\nanalytical description. Let us first be g \u2192 0 and U0 > 0.\nFrom Eq. (21) it follows that \u2206 = 0 and from (17) it\ngoes Gk = 0.\nAccording to (20) under these conditions the chemical\npotential \u03bc = \u03b5\u03030 /2 for an arbitrary U0 6= 0. The number\nof particles in the atom subsystem equals\nX\nNA = 2 \u03b8(\u2212\u03bep\u2032 ).\np\n\nwith quantity \u03bep\u2032 equal to\n\u03bep\u2032 =\n\np2\n1\n1\n\u2212 \u03b5\u03030 + U0 NA\n2m 2\n2\n\nin accordance with (12). Taking (24) into account and\n\u2032\nthat Mg=0\n= 0, we find straightforwardly that in the\ninterval\n0<\n\n1\n1\n\u03b5\u03030 < \u03b5t + U0 Nt\n2\n2\n\n(26)\n\ngas of atoms in the normal state is in equilibrium with the\ncondensate of quasi-molecules. At the left-hand boundary at \u03b5\u03030 \u2192 0 the number of atoms NA \u2192 0 and all\nparticles prove to be in the condensate of quasimolecules.\nAs \u03b5\u03030 grows, the magnitude M0 falls continuously. So,\nat the right-hand boundary of interval (26), NA = Nt ,\ni.e., the purely atomic phase appears. For U0 < 0, the\npicture of behavior M0 and NA remains qualitatively\nsame. However, the condensate of quasi-molecules vanishes with growth of tilde\u03b50 before, approximately at\n1\n1\n2 \u03b5\u03030 \u2243 \u03b5t \u2212 2 |U0 | Nt . In fact, this shift enhances to some\nextent owing to appearance of the gap \u2206 in the spectrum\nof atoms, which can be found from solving Eq. (21) at\ng \u2192 0.\nLet us turn to the solution of the system of equations\nobtained above when the resonance interaction is dominant. We omit the terms with U0 and restrict ourselves\nwith values g which correspond to the small dimensionless parameter \u03b3 \u226a 1. p\nThen in accordance with (18) and\n(25) one has \u2206/\u03b5t = \u03b3 M0 /Nt \u226a 1.\nOne can straightforwardly see that | dp | \u223c \u03b3 m with\nm \u2265 5/2 in (12) and the renormalization of the spectrum\ncan be neglected. Let us start from the consideration of\ninterval \u03b5\u03030 \u226b \u2206. In this case from Eqs. (19) we can find\n\u03bc=\n\n3\n1\n\u03b5\u03030 \u2212 \u03b3 2 (\u03bc\u03b5t )1/2 ln(\u03bc/\u2206)\n2\n8\n\n(27)\n\n\f5\nCalculating (22), we have for the number of atoms\nNA\n=\nNt\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bc\n\u03b5t\n\n\u00133/2\n\n+O\n\n\u0012\n\n\u22062\n\u03bc2\n\n\u0013\n\nDetermining quantities wk (7) and G2k (17), for the number of abovecondensate quasi-molecules (23) in the limit\n\u03b5\u03030 \u226b \u2206 we obtain\n2M \u2032\n1\n\u2243 \u03b3 3/2\nNt\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bc\n\u03b5t\n\n\u00139/8\n\n2M0\n\u22431\u2212\nNt\n\n\u03bc\n\u03b5t\n\n\u00133/2\n\n1\n\u2212 \u03b3 3/2\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bc\n\u03b5t\n\n\u00139/8\n\n(28)\n\nThe magnitude (\u03b5\u03030 /2\u03b5t )\u2217 , where M0 vanishes, one can\nestimate if the second term in (27) is omitted.\n\u0012\n\n\u03b5\u03030\n2\u03b5t\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2217\n\n4\n\u2243 1 \u2212 \u03b3 3/2\n3\n\n(29)\n\nC 2 = C\u22172\n\n(32)\n\nIn narrow interval of about \u03b3\nin the vicinity of this\nboundary the number of excited quasi-molecules M \u2032\nproves to be larger than M0 . As \u03b5\u03030 decreases, the number of condensate particles M0 increases rapidly and\nM0 \u226b M \u2032 .\nLet us find now the magnitude of sound velocity C in\nthe system. For the equilibrium exchange of atoms between both subsystems, the sound velocity is determined\nby the thermodynamic relation\nNt \u2202\u03bc\n,\nm \u2202Nt\n\nC2 =\n\n1 2\u03b5t\n3 m\n\n(33)\n\nIt is interesting that this limiting value is reached from\nthe region where M0 6= 0 and the resonance interaction is\nabsent. Thus the sound velocity as a function of \u03b5\u03030 /2\u03b5t\ngrows continuously to value (33) typical for the collective\noscillation of an ensemble of free Fermi particles. For\n\u03b3 2 \u226a 1, the drastic growth C 2 to the value (33) occurs\nwithin narrow interval of about \u03b3 2 .\nConsider now the region 0 < \u03b5\u03030 < \u2206. Equation (19)\nin this limit goes over into\n3/2\n\n3/2\n\nC2 =\n\n(31)\n\nFar from the boundary (29)\n\nIn the limit \u03bc \u2192 \u03b5t and M0 \u2192 0 we find\n\nEmploying relation (24), we find the number of condensate quasi-molecules\n\u0012\n\nReturning to definition (30), we find a general expression\nfor the sound velocity\n\u0012 \u00131/2\nC\u22172\nNt\n3 2 \u03b5t \u03bc\n2\n2\nC =\n\u03b3\n, C\u2217 =\n\u0010 \u00111/2\n16 m \u03b5t\nM0\n3m 2\n1 + \u03b5\u03bct\n2\u03b5t C\u2217\n\n(30)\n\ncharacteristic for the single-component systems, see, eg.,\n[23]. For g \u2192 0, one has C 2 = 0. This result is a consequence of the transition of Fermi particles with compression to the quasi-molecular subsystem and \u2202p/\u2202\u03c1 = 0.\nThe similar effect takes place in an ideal Bose-gas at\nT < Tc when a fraction of abovecondensate particles converts to the condensate with the pressure growth.\nWhen calculating the derivative \u2202\u03bc/\u2202Nt , only the dependence \u2206 on M0 in the logarithm argument proves to\nbe essential.

Accordingly, C 2 tends to zero at |\u03b5\u03030 | \u2192 \u221e. Comparing\n(37), (35), (32), and (33), we see that the sound velocity increases gradually with the growth \u03b5\u03030 , reaching its\nmaximum value (33).\nSuperfluidity and critical velocity vc in the system considered are determined simultaneously by the spectra of\nsingle-particle Fermi excitations and collective Bose excitations. Accordingly, vc takes the minimum value from\ntwo velocities: C and min(Ep /p). Quantity Ep is determined by (14). For \u03b5\u03030 in the vicinity of 2\u03b5t , the critical\nvelocity is governed by Fermi excitations and vc \u2192 0\ntogether with M0 \u2192 0, \u2206 \u2192 0, see (18). Velocity\nmin(Ep /p) increases monotonously as \u03b5\u03030 decreases. On\nthe contrary, the sound velocity falls. The critical velocity therewith keeps to be governed by single-particle\nexcitations up to \u03b5\u03030 /2\u03b5t \u2243 1/3. For smaller values \u03b5\u03030 /2\u03b5t\nincluding the region of negative \u03b5\u03030 , the critical velocity\nis determined by the sound velocity.\nThe work is supported by the Russian Foundation of\nBasic Researches.\n\n[14] P.
