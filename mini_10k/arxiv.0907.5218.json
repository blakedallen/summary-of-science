Application of in-plane magnetic field to these crystals,\nincreasing the Zeeman energy, has negligible effect on the resonances just below Landau level filling\n\u03bd = 2, but increases the pinning frequencies near \u03bd = 1, particularly for smaller quasiparticle/hole\ndensities. The charge dynamics near \u03bd = 1, characteristic of a crystal order, are affected by spin, in\na manner consistent with a Skyrme crystal.\n\nSpin textures, structures of spin rotating coherently in\nspace, are of importance to a number of different classes\nof materials [1]. An example of such a spin texture\nwith wide application in descriptions of magnetic order is\nthe skyrmion, a topological defect first used to describe\nbaryons [2]. Skyrmions can form arrays which have been\nconsidered in a variety of magnetic systems, and which\nhave been seen in bulk material [3] in magnetic field, in\nneutron scattering.\nSkyrmions are particularly important in twodimensional electron systems (2DES) with an additional\nspin or pseudospin degree of freedom [4, 5, 6, 7]. In\nthese systems, the skyrmion has a unit charge, bundled\nalong with a texture containing multiple flipped spins\n(or pseudospins) which spread out in space to reduce\nexchange energy. The skyrmion is also predicted [6]\nto have a spread-out charge distribution different, for\nexample, from the Landau level (LL) orbitals that would\ncharacterize an isolated electron in 2DES.\nSkyrmions were identified in 2DES as excitations near\nLandau level filling \u03bd = 1 in experiments [8, 9, 10] that\nmeasured the electron spin polarization vs \u03bd, and the\npresence of skyrmions was also shown to affect the measured energy gaps in transport [11, 12]. The wide applicability of skyrmions in 2DES is attested to also by their\npresence in layer-index pseudospin of bilayers [13], valley\npseudospin [14] in AlAs, or in predictions involving both\nvalley pseudospin and spin in graphene [15].\nWhen the skyrmions are sufficiently dilute, they are\nexpected to crystallize, stabilized by Coulomb repulsion. The predicted state has tightly interwoven spin\nand charge crystal order, and has been of great interest\nin 2DES [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]\nand has been considered theoretically for graphene [29].\nNMR [23, 24, 25, 26] and heat capacity [27] experiments\nin the Skyrme crystal range near \u03bd = 1 in 2DES have\nfocused on the strong coupling of nuclear spins to electron spins, likely via a soft spin wave which was very\nrecently unveiled in Raman scattering [28]. The soft spin\nmode has been interpreted as arising from XY-spin ori-\n\nentational order [17].\nThe main result of this paper is that the charge dynamics of 2DES near \u03bd = 1 show characteristics of a\nSkyrme crystal; we find these dynamics are affected by\nthe Zeeman energy and by the charge density in a manner\nconsistent with calculations [16, 17, 34] done for Skyrme\ncrystals. Our ability to observe this demonstrates as well\nthat the charge distribution of a skyrmion in a crystal\ndiffers from that of an ordinary Landau quasiparticle or\nhole. The experiments were conducted using broadband\nmicrowave conductivity spectroscopy, which has no direct spin sensitivity.\nThis microwave spectroscopy has some time ago revealed [30] pinned Wigner crystals of the quasiparticles/holes within integer quantum Hall effects. The microwave spectra of these \"integer quantum Hall Wigner\ncrystals\", like those of other pinned crystals [31] in 2DES\nin high magnetic field, exhibit a striking resonance, which\nis understood as a pinning mode resonance [32], due to\nthe collective oscillations of the crystal within the disorder potential that pins it. Pinning modes are present\nwithin the integer quantum Hall effects around \u03bd = 1, 2, 3\nand 4 in low-disorder 2DES. When the exchange energy\ndominates the Zeeman energy, skyrmions are expected to\nbe present around \u03bd = 1; it is well established [11, 33]\nthat near other integer \u03bd under any experimentally accessible conditions in 2DES, skyrmions do not form.\nThis paper addresses the nature of the crystal around\n\u03bd = 1, and shows that the pinning mode near \u03bd = 1 is\naffected by skyrmion formation. These effects become\nclear through systematic study of the dependence of the\npinning mode on in-plane field, Bk , which at fixed \u03bd reduces the skyrmion spin [4, 5, 6, 7]. Bk has essentially\nno effect on the crystal just below \u03bd = 2, expected to\nbe a Wigner crystal of single Landau quasiholes. In contrast, Bk increases the pinning frequency of the crystal\nnear \u03bd = 1. In addition, the skyrmion density (the same\nas the charge density) in the crystal increases for \u03bd farther from exactly 1, and is also large for higher electron\ndensity 2DES. We find Bk increases the pinning mode fre-\n\n\f2\nB\n\n0.96\n\n\u03bd=\n2.00\n1.96\n\n0.92\n\n1.92\n\n1\n\n2\n\nf (GHz)\n\n3\n\n4\n\n1.84\n1.80\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nf (GHz)\n\nFIG. 1: (color online).

This shows that spin size of\nskyrmions is affected by their mutual proximity [17], an\nillustration of the intertwined nature of charge and spin\nin this state.\nWe used 2DES's from two high quality wafers of\nGaAs/AlGaAs/GaAs quantum wells. Sample A is a 30\nnm quantum well (#5-20-05.1), with the electron density\nn = 2.7 \u00d7 1011 / cm2 , and a low temperature mobility\n\u03bc = 27 \u00d7 106 cm2 /Vs. Sample B is a 50 nm quantum\nwell (#7-20-99.1), with a lower n = 1.1 \u00d7 1011 / cm2 and\n\u03bc = 15 \u00d7 106 cm2 /Vs.\nThe microwave spectroscopy technique is similar to\nthose reported earlier [30, 31]. As illustrated in Fig.\n1(a), we deposited on the sample surface a metal-film\ncoplanar waveguide, with length l = 4 \u223c 28 mm and\nslot width W = 30 \u223c 80 \u03bcm, impedance matched to\nZ0 = 50 \u03a9. The microwaves couple capacitively to the\n2DES. From the absorption P of the signal by the 2DES,\nwe can calculate the real part of its diagonal conductivity\nRe [\u03c3xx (f )] = (W/2lZ0 ) lnP .\nTo tilt the sample in magnetic field, we designed a rotator with low-reflection broadband microwave connections through flexible microstrips. The tilting angle \u03b8\nbetween the sample normal axis and the field direction is\ncalculated from the total fields Btot of prominent integer\nquantum Hall states. The perpendicular field component\nB\u22a5 = Btot cos \u03b8. The measurements were done at the low\npower limit and the sample temperature was 40 mK.\nFor sample A, Fig. 1 shows a set of conductivity spectra (b) around \u03bd = 1 and (c) just below \u03bd = 2.

The skyrmion sizes, hK0 i, estimated by Ref.\n[17], are marked in the graph. (3) The relative change in fpk\nfrom \u03b8 = 0o to 31o .\n\n[30]. In the following, for brevity, we shall refer to \u03bd\njust below 2 which exhibit the resonance as \u03bd = 2\u2212 , and\nthe resonant \u03bd ranges just above (below) 1 as \u03bd = 1+\n(1\u2212 ). In both Fig. 1(b) and (c), the resonance peak frequency fpk decreases with increasing partial filling factor\n\u03bd \u2217 = |\u03bd\u2212nearest integer|. This is consistent with the\npicture of a weakly pinned crystal [32], because higher\n\u03bd \u2217 means denser quasiparticles/holes and stronger interaction, and thus a weaker role of disorder. Comparing\nFig. 1 (b) and (c), we notice that, close to integer \u03bd, the\n\u03bd = 2\u2212 resonances have a stronger \u03bd \u2217 -dependence of fpk\nthan the \u03bd = 1+ and 1\u2212 resonances.\nStill for sample A, we repeat the measurement in a\ntilted magnetic field. We fix B\u22a5 and hence \u03bd, and increase Btot by a factor of 1/ cos \u03b8. The Zeeman energy\nalso increases, since it is proportional to Btot . Fig. 2 (a)\nshows the spectra at \u03bd = 1.05 and 1.91, each taken at\n\u03b8 = 0o and 31o . At these two \u03bd, the quasi-particles/holes\nare within the same orbital LL (N = 0), and have equal\ndensity n\u2217 \u223c 1.3 \u00d7 1010 /cm2 , calculated as (\u03bd \u2217 /\u03bd)n. At\n\u03b8 = 0o , the \u03bd = 1.05 resonance peak is at about half the\nfrequency of the \u03bd = 1.91 resonance. Tilting to 31o has\nnegligible effect on the \u03bd = 1.91 resonance, but shifts the\n\u03bd = 1.05 resonance to higher frequency. The \u03bd = 0.95\nresonance, not shown here, behaves almost identically to\nthe \u03bd = 1.05 resonance.\nPanels (b) and (c) in Fig. 2 present the effect of Bk\n\n\f3\n\u2212\n\n(a)\n1.0\n\n1.8\n1.6\n\no\n\n\u03b8=0\n\n\u03b8=63\n\n\u03bd=1.04\n\no\n\n1.0\n\nfpk (GHz)\n\nRe[\u03c3xx(f)] (\u03bcS)\n\n0.5\n0.0\n1.5 (b)\n\n+\n\n\u03bd=2\n\n\u03bd=0.96\n\n(a) <\u039a0>\n\u223c4.5\n\n1.4\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03bd=1\n\no\n\n\u03b8=0\n~\ng=0.012\n\n\u03bd=1\n\no\n\n(b)\n\n\u03b8=63\n~\n~\ng=0.026\n\n~3.5\n\n1.2\n\n~2.5\n\n1.0\n0.8\n\n0.5\n\n~2.0\n\n0.6\n\n0.0\n2.0 (c)\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n\n\u03bd=1.90\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n~1.5\n0.0\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\n1.2\n\n1.6 0.0\n10\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\n1.2\n\n1.6\n\n2\n\nn* (10 /cm )\n\n4\n\nf (GHz)\nFIG. 3: (color online).

The \u03bd = 1+ and 1\u2212 curves also overlap with\nthe \u03bd = 2\u2212 curve for high n\u2217 . But for low n\u2217 (< 2.5 \u00d7\n1010 /cm2 ), the \u03bd = 1+ and 1\u2212 resonances have lower fpk\nthan the \u03bd = 2\u2212 resonance for the same n\u2217 .\nFig. 2(c) plots the ratio, fpk (31o )/fpk (0o ), of \u03b8 = 31o\nand 0o fpk . fpk increases with tilting only for the \u03bd = 1+\nand 1\u2212 resonances with low n\u2217 (< 2.5 \u00d7 1010 /cm2 ). The\ntwo curves of fpk vs n\u2217 , for \u03bd = 1+ and 1\u2212 , agree with\neach other, indicating a still good particle-hole symmetry.\nTilting has negligible effect on the \u03bd = 2\u2212 resonances, or\nthe \u03bd = 1+ and 1\u2212 resonances with high n\u2217 .\nSample B has lower n than sample A, and as discussed\nbelow, is predicted to be capable of supporting larger\nskyrmions. Near integer \u03bd, sample B also displays resonances in the real conductivity spectra. Fig. 3 shows the\nresonances at three typical \u03bd: (a) 0.96, (b) 1.04, and (c)\n1.90, each taken at \u03b8 = 0o and \u03b8 = 63o . Tilting shifts\nthe \u03bd = 0.96 and \u03bd = 1.04 resonances to higher frequencies, in clear contrast to the negligible effect it has on the\n\u03bd = 1.90 resonance.\nFor sample B, at \u03b8 = 0o and 63o respectively, Fig. 4 (a)\nand (b) show fpk vs n\u2217 for \u03bd = 1+ , 1\u2212 and 2\u2212 . Here we\nalso see that fpk decreases as n\u2217 increases, consistent with\na weak pinning picture. The \u03bd = 1+ and 1\u2212 resonances\nshow good agreement with each other , but have lower fpk\nthan the \u03bd = 2\u2212 resonances, with the difference greater\nfor smaller n\u2217 . Comparing Fig. 4 (a) at \u03b8 = 0o and (b)\n\nFIG. 4: (color online). From sample B, fpk as a function\nof n\u2217 for the \u03bd = 2\u2212 (open squares), \u03bd = 1+ (solid circles),\nand \u03bd = 1\u2212 (open circles) resonances, at (a) \u03b8 = 0o and (b)\n\u03b8 = 63o . The skyrmion sizes, hK0 i, estimated by Ref. [17],\nare marked in the graph.\n\nat 63o , we see Bk has negligible effect on the \u03bd = 2\u2212\nresonances but increases the frequencies of the \u03bd = 1+\nand 1\u2212 resonances.\nBy analogy to the Wigner crystal pinning modes found\nat very low \u03bd (<\n\u223c 1/5) [31], the observed resonances at \u03bd\njust away from 1 and other integers are clear signatures\nof crystallized quasiparticles/holes [30]. Here we show\nthat the dependence on Bk indicates a distinct difference\nof the crystals of \u03bd = 1+ and 1\u2212 from that of \u03bd = 2\u2212 ,\nand provides evidence for a Skyrme crystal near \u03bd = 1.\nThe effect of Bk cannot be explained without invoking\nthe spin degree of freedom. This is clear from the negligible effect of Bk , except for the crystals with low n\u2217\nnear \u03bd = 1. The crystals studied here, for \u03bd = 2\u2212 , 1+\nand 1\u2212 , all belong to the lowest orbital LL. If the effect\nof Bk were due to the orbital wave function, it would be\nunlikely that the same effect would be completely absent\nfor the \u03bd = 2\u2212 crystal and the \u03bd = 1+ and 1\u2212 crystals\nwith high n\u2217 [35].\nThe effect of Bk near \u03bd = 1 finds a natural explanation in a predicted crystal of skyrmions [16, 17, 18, 19,\n20, 21, 22]. The skyrmion size, hK0 i, denotes the number\nof flipped spins (relative to the maximally spin-polarized\nstate with the same charge) [6, 17]. Two key parameters control hK0 i. One is the \u0001Zeeman/Coulomb energy\nratio [6], g\u0303 = g\u03bcB Btot / e2 /\u01ebl0 , where |g| \u2248 0.44 is the\ng factor in GaAs, \u03bcB the Bohr magneton,\n\u01eb \u2248 13 the\np\ndielectric constant of GaAs, and l0 = h\u0304/eB\u22a5 the magnetic length. Larger g\u0303 makes flipping spins more costly,\nand favors smaller hK0 i. The second parameter is n\u2217 :\nincreasing n\u2217 by tuning \u03bd away from 1 brings skyrmions\ncloser and limits hK0 i. Ref. [17] calculated hK0 i, predicting the reduction of hK0 i on increasing g\u0303 or n\u2217 .\nFor our samples, A has g\u0303 \u223c 0.019 at \u03bd = 1 in perpendicular field, and B with\na lower n has a smaller\n\u221a\ng\u0303 \u223c 0.012, because g\u0303 \u223c n. Upon tilting, g\u0303 increases\nby a factor of 1/ cos \u03b8, the same as Btot . Based on Ref.\n\n\f4\n[17], the calculated hK0 i for different g\u0303 and n\u2217 are marked\nin Fig. 2(b) and Fig. 4.\nThe data taken near \u03bd = 1 in both samples show a\nstrikingly consistent correlation between fpk and the calculated hK0 i. The correlation also holds for intermediate\n\u03b8, for example 39o for sample B, not just the \u03b8 shown in\nthe graphs. The negligible effect Bk has on \u03bd = 2\u2212 serves\nas a control, since the absence of skyrmions there is well\nestablished. For the same n\u2217 , when hK0 i is small, the\npinning mode frequencies fpk of the \u03bd = 1+ and 1\u2212 crystals are close to that of the \u03bd = 2\u2212 crystal. The point\nwhere \u03bd = 1+ and 1\u2212 crystals start to have lower fpk\nthan the \u03bd = 2\u2212 crystal is always at hK0 i \u223c 2, and the\ndifference widens as hK0 i increases. The separation of\nthe curves occurs consistenly at hK0 i \u223c 2, even though\nthis condition occurs at different n\u2217 when g\u0303 changes.\nAt fixed n\u2217 , decreasing Bk produces larger predicted\nhK0 i, and we find a lower fpk . This suggests a crystal\nformed by larger skyrmions is more weakly pinned. This\neffect can be due to two possible mechanisms which may\nboth be operational: one from skyrmion-disorder interaction and the other from skyrmion-skyrmion interaction.\nLarger skyrmions average disorder over a larger area,\nresulting in an effectively weaker disorder, and hence\na lower fpk . fpk is also sensitive to the shear modulus, which is determined by the interaction between the\nskyrmions. When the skyrmions grow bigger and begin\nto overlap, the inter-skyrmion repulsion is expected to\nget stronger and to increase the shear modulus of the\ncrystal [34]. And within the weak pinning picture [32],\na stiffer crystal has lower fpk , because it is more difficult for the crystal to deform to take advantage of the\ndisorder landscape.\nAs \u03bd departs from 1, a phase transition is predicted,\nfrom a triangular-lattice ferromagnet of spin helicity to a\nsquare-lattice antiferromagnet [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22],\nin favor of lower exchange energy at a cost in the\nMadelung energy. From calculations in Ref. [17], this\nis predicted to happen roughly at hK0 i \u223c 2.5 in Fig.\n2(b), \u223c 5 in Fig. 4(a) and \u223c 1.5 in Fig. 4(b). In our\nmeasurement we do not see any abrupt jump in the pinning frequencies. One possible explanation is that sample\ndisorder smears the phase boundary.\nTo summarize, pinning mode resonances observed\naround integer \u03bd provide clear evidence of crystal phases\nof the quasiparticles. The pinning modes near \u03bd = 1\nappear to be consistently determined by the predicted\nskyrmion sizes, indicating the crystal around that filling\nis formed of skyrmions at least for small n\u2217 . As Bk causes\nthe predicted skyrmions to shrink, we observe upshift of\nthe pinning frequency, which saturates as skyrmions approach single spin flips. The dependence of the pinning\non the spin is a consequence of the coupled charge and\nspin degrees of freedom for crystallized skyrmions.\nWe thank R. C\u00f4t\u00e9, H. A.
