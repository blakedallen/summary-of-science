We quote [15] for formal definitions, examples and\nmore details. In the last two decades, several researchers have tried to capture this intuitive idea\nin order to develop algorithms ensuring better convergence results: see for instance the pioneer\nwork [14], and also [17] for a recent survey.\nIn this work we shall be interested in a particular class of well-structured (nonsmooth) functions, namely functions admitting a Whitney stratification (see Section 2 for definitions). Since\nthis class contains in particular the semialgebraic and the subanalytic functions (more generally,\nfunctions that are definable in some o-minimal structure over R), the derived results can directly\nbe applied in several concrete optimization problems involving such structures. Our central idea\nis to relate derivative ideas from two distinct mathematical sources: variational analysis and\ndifferential geometry. Specifically, we derive a lower bound on the norms of Clarke subgradients\nat a given point in terms of the \"Riemannian\" gradient with respect to the stratum containing\nthat point. This is a direct consequence of the \"projection formula\" given in Proposition 4 and\nhas as corollaries a Morse-Sard type theorem for Clarke critical points of lower semicontinuous\nWhitney stratifiable functions (Corollary 5(ii)) as well as a nonsmooth version of the KurdykaLojasiewicz inequality for lower semicontinuous definable functions (Theorem 11). Although the\nproofs are reasonably routine, analogous results fail for the (broader) convex-stable subdifferential (introduced and studied in [3]), unless f is assumed to be locally Lipschitz continuous, see\nRemark 9.\nAs mentioned above, convergence theory for algorithms is one of the main motivations for\nthis work. In order to treat nonconvex (and nonsmooth) minimization problems, the authors\nof [3] introduced an algorithm called the \"gradient sampling algorithm\". The idea behind this\nalgorithm was to sample gradients of nearby points of the current iterate and to produce the next\niterate by following the vector of minimum norm in the convex hull generated by the sampled\nnegative gradients. In the case that the function is locally Lipschitz, the above method can be\n1\n\n\fviewed as a kind of \u03b5-Clarke subgradient algorithm for which both theoretical and numerical\nresults are quite satisfactory, see [3]. The convergence of the whole sequence of iterates remains\nhowever an open question and this is also the case for many classical subgradient methods for\nnonconvex minimization, see [11]. Following the ideas of [16] and [12], we would hope that\nLojasiewicz inequality that we develop ((17) in Section 4) could play a prominent role in the\nglobal convergence of subgradient algorithms.\n\n2\n\nPreliminaries\n\nIn this section we recall several definitions and results concerning nonsmooth analysis (subgradients, generalized critical points) and stratification theory. In what follows the vector space\nRn is endowed with its canonical scalar product h*, *i.\nNonsmooth analysis. Given an extended-real-valued function f : Rn \u2192 R \u222a {+\u221e} we\ndenote its domain by dom f := {x \u2208 Rn : f (x) < +\u221e}, its graph by\nGraph f := {(x, f (x)) \u2208 Rn \u00d7R : x \u2208 dom f }\nand its epigraph by\nepi f := {(x, \u03b2) \u2208 Rn \u00d7R : f (x) \u2264 \u03b2}.\nIn this work we shall deal with lower semicontinuous functions, that is, functions for which epi f\nis a closed subset of Rn \u00d7R. In this setting, we say that x\u2217 \u2208 Rn is a Fr\u00e9chet subgradient of f at\nx \u2208 dom f provided that\nlim inf\n\ny\u2192x,y6=x\n\nf (y) \u2212 f (x) \u2212 hx\u2217 , y \u2212 xi\n\u2265 0.\nky \u2212 xk\n\n(1)\n\nThe set of all Fr\u00e9chet subgradients of f at x is called the Fr\u00e9chet subdifferential of f at x and\n\u02c6 (x). If x \u2208\n\u02c6 (x) = \u2205.\nis denoted by \u2202f\n/ dom f then we set \u2202f\n\nLet us give a geometrical interpretation of the above definition: it is well known that the\ngradient of a C 1 function f : Rn \u2192 R at x \u2208 Rn can be defined geometrically as the vector\n\u2207f (x) \u2208 Rn such that (\u2207f (x), \u22121) is normal to the tangent space T(x,f (x)) Graph f of (the C 1\nmanifold) Graph f at (x, f (x)), that is,\n(\u2207f (x), \u22121) \u22a5 T(x,f (x)) Graph f.\n\nA similar interpretation can be stated for Fr\u00e9chet subgradients. Let\nnormal cone of a subset C of Rn at x \u2208 C by\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\ny\u2212x\ni \u2264\nN\u0302C (x) = v \u2208 Rn : lim sup h v,\n\uf8f4\n||x \u2212 y||\ny\u2192x\n\uf8f3\ny\u2208C\\{x}\n\nus first define the (Fr\u00e9chet)\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fd\n0 .\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\n\n(2)\n\nThen it can be proved (see [21, Theorem 8.9], for example) that for a nonsmooth function f we\nhave:\n\u02c6 (x) if and only if (x\u2217 , \u22121) \u2208 N\u0302epi f (x, f (x)).\nx\u2217 \u2208 \u2202f\n(3)\n2\n\n\fThe Fr\u00e9chet subdifferential extends the notion of a derivative in the sense that if f is differentiable\n\u02c6 (x) = {\u2207f (x)}. However, it is not completely satisfactory in optimization, since\nat x then \u2202f\n\u02c6\n\u2202f (x) might be empty-valued at points of particular interest (think of the example of the function\nf (x) = \u2212||x||, at x = 0). Moreover, the Fr\u00e9chet subdifferential is not a closed mapping, so it is\nunstable computationally. For this reason we also consider (see [21, Chapter 8], for example):\n(i) the limiting subdifferential \u2202f (x) of f at x \u2208 dom f :\n\np \u2208 \u2202f (x) \u21d0\u21d2 \u2203(xn , x\u2217n )n\u2208N\n\n\uf8f1\nlim xn = x,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nn\u2192\u221e\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u02c6\nlim f (xn ) = f (x),\n\u2282 Graph \u2202f :\nn\u2192\u221e\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 lim x\u2217n = p,\n\n(4)\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n\u02c6 := {(u, u\u2217 ) : u \u2208 \u2202f\n\u02c6 (u)}.\nwhere Graph \u2202f\n\n(ii) the asymptotic limiting subdifferential \u2202 \u221e f (x) of f at x \u2208 dom f :\n\uf8f1\nlim yn = x,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nn\u2192\u221e\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u221e\n\u2217\n+\n\u02c6\nlim f (yn ) = f (x),\nq \u2208 \u2202 f (x) \u21d0\u21d2 \u2203(yn , yn )n\u2208N \u2282 Graph \u2202f, \u2203tn \u0581 0 :\nn\u2192\u221e\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 lim tn yn\u2217 = q.\n\n(5)\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nWhen x \u2208\n/ dom f we set \u2202f (x) = \u2202 \u221e f (x) = \u2205.\nThe Clarke subdifferential \u2202 \u25e6 f (x) of f at x \u2208 dom f is the central notion of this work. It can\nbe defined in several (equivalent) ways, see [4]. The definition below (see [19, Theorem 8.11])\nis the most convenient for our purposes. (For any subset S of Rn we denote by co S the closed\nconvex hull of S.)\nDefinition 1 (Clarke subdifferential) The Clarke subdifferential \u2202 \u25e6 f (x) of f at x is the set\n\uf8f1\nif x \u2208 dom f\n\uf8f2 co {\u2202f (x) + \u2202 \u221e f (x)} ,\n\u25e6\n\u2202 f (x) =\n(6)\n\uf8f3\n\u2205,\nif x \u2208\n/ dom f\n\nRemark 1 It can be shown that an analogous to (3) formula holds also for the Clarke subdifferential, if N\u0302epi f (x, f (x)) is replaced by the Clarke normal cone, which is the closed convex\nhull of the limiting normal cone. The latter cone comes naturally from the Fr\u00e9chet normal cone\nby closing its graph, see [21, pp. 305, 336] for details.\nFrom the above definitions it follows directly that for all x \u2208 Rn , one has\n\u02c6 (x) \u2282 \u2202f (x) \u2282 \u2202 \u25e6 f (x).\n\u2202f\n\n(7)\n\nThe elements of the limiting (respectively, Clarke) subdifferential are called limiting (respectively, Clarke) subgradients.\nThe notion of a Clarke critical point (respectively, critical value, asymptotic critical value)\nis defined as follows.\n3\n\n\fDefinition 2 (Clarke critical point) We say that x \u2208 Rn is a Clarke critical point of the\nfunction f if\n\u2202 \u25e6 f (x) \u220b 0.\nDefinition 3 ((asymptotic) Clarke critical value) (i) We say that \u03b1 \u2208 R is a Clarke critical value of f if the level set f \u22121 ({\u03b1}) contains a Clarke critical point.\n(ii) We say that \u03bb \u2208 R \u222a {\u00b1\u221e} is an asymptotic Clarke critical value of f , if there exists a\nsequence (xn , x\u2217n )n\u22651 \u2282 Graph \u2202 \u25e6 f , such that\n\uf8f1\nf (xn ) \u2192 \u03bb\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n\n(1 + ||xn ||) ||x\u2217n || \u2192 0.\n\nLet us make some observations concerning the above definitions:\nRemark 2 (i) Both limiting and Clarke subgradients are generalizations of the usual gradients:\nindeed, if f is C 1 around x then we have:\n\u2202f (x) = \u2202 \u25e6 f (x) = {\u2207f (x)}.\n(ii) The asymptotic limiting subdifferential should not be thought as a set of subgradients.\nRoughly speaking it is designed to detect \"vertical tangents\" to the graph of f . For instance,\n1\nfor the (nonsmooth) function f (x) = x 3 (x \u2208 R) we have \u2202 \u221e f (0) = R+ . Note that since the\ndomain of the Fr\u00e9chet subdifferential is dense in dom f , we always have \u2202 \u221e f (x) \u220b 0, for all\nx \u2208 dom f (see also [21, Corollary 8.10]); therefore, this latter relation cannot be regarded as a\nmeaningful definition of critical points.\n(iii) To illustrate the definition of the Clarke critical point (Definition 1) let us consider the\nexample of the function f : R \u2192 R defined by\n\u001a\nx, if x \u2264 0\n\u221a\nf (x) =\n\u2212 x if x > 0.\n\u02c6 (0) = \u2205 and \u2202f (0) = {1}. However, since \u2202 \u221e f (0) = R\u2212 it follows from (6) that\nThen \u2202f\n\u25e6\n\u2202 f (0) = (\u2212\u221e, 1], so x = 0 is a Clarke critical point.\n(iv) It follows from Definition 3 that every Clarke critical value \u03b1 \u2208 R is also an asymptotic\nClarke critical value (indeed, given x0 \u2208 f \u22121 ({\u03b1}) with 0 \u2208 \u2202 \u25e6 f (x0 ), it is sufficient to take\nxn := x0 and x\u2217n = 0). Note that in case that f has a bounded domain dom f , Definition 3 (ii)\ncan be simplified in the following way: the value \u03bb \u2208 R \u222a {\u00b1\u221e} is critical if, and only if, there\nexists a sequence (xn , x\u2217n )n\u22651 \u2282 Graph \u2202 \u25e6 f , such that f (xn ) \u2192 \u03bb and x\u2217n \u2192 0.\nStratification results. By the term stratification we mean a locally finite partition of a\ngiven set into differentiable manifolds, which, roughly speaking, fit together in a regular manner.\nLet us give a formal definition of a C p -stratification of a set (for general facts about stratifications\nwe quote [18] or [10] and references therein).\nLet X be a subset of Rn and p a positive integer. A C p stratification X = (Xi )i\u2208I of X is a\nlocally finite partition of X into C p submanifolds Xi of Rn such that for each i 6= j\nXi \u2229 Xj 6= \u2205 =\u21d2 Xj \u2282 Xi \\ Xi .\n4\n\n\fThe submanifolds Xi are called strata of X . Furthermore, given a finite collection {A1 , . . . , Aq } of\nsubsets of X, a stratification X =(Xi )i\u2208I is said to be compatible with the collection {A1 , . . . , Aq }\nif each Ai is a locally finite union of strata Xj .\nIn this work we shall use a special type of stratifications (called Whitney stratifications)\nfor which the strata are such that their tangent spaces also \"fit regularly\". To give a precise\nmeaning to this statement, let us first define the distance (or gap) of two vector subspaces V\nand W of Rn by the following standard formula\n(\n)\nD(V, W ) = max\n\nsup\n\nd(v, W ),\n\nv\u2208V, ||v||=1\n\nsup\n\nd(w, V ) .\n\nw\u2208W, ||w||=1\n\nNote that\nsup\nv\u2208V, ||v||=1\n\nd(v, W ) = 0 \u21d0\u21d2 V \u2282 W.\n\nFurther we say that a sequence {Vk }k\u2208N of subspaces of Rn converges to the subspace V of Rn\n(in short, V = lim Vk ) provided\nk\u2192+\u221e\n\nlim D(Vk , V ) = 0.\n\nk\u2192+\u221e\n\nNotice that in this case all the subspaces Vk eventually have the same dimension (say d), so that\nthe above convergence is essentially equivalent to the convergence in the grassmannian manifold\nGnd .\nA C p -stratification X = (Xi )i\u2208I of X has the Whitney-(a) property, if for each x \u2208 Xi \u2229 Xj\n(with i 6= j) and for each sequence {xk }k\u22651 \u2282 Xi we have:\n\uf8fc\nlim xk = x\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fd\nk\u2192\u221e\nand\n=\u21d2 Tx Xj \u2282 T\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\nlim Txk Xi = T\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nwhere Tx Xj (respectively, Txk Xi ) denotes the tangent space of the manifold Xj at x (respectively,\nof Xi at xk ). In the sequel we shall use the term Whitney stratification to refer to a C 1 stratification with the Whitney-(a) property.\n\n3\n\nProjections formulae for subgradients\n\nIn this section we make precise the links between the Clarke subgradients of a function whose\ngraph (is closed and) admits a Whitney stratification and the gradients of f (with respect to the\nstrata). As a corollary we obtain a nonsmooth extension of the Morse-Sard theorem for such\nfunctions (see Corollary 5).\nLet f : Rn \u2192 R \u222a {+\u221e} be an extended-real-valued function with a nonempty closed\ndomain dom f (that is, f is lower semicontinuous). We shall deal with Whitney stratifications\nS = (Si )i\u2208I of the graph Graph f of f satisfying for all i \u2208 I and u \u2208 Si the transversality\ncondition:\nen+1 \u2208\n/ Tu Si\n(H)\nwhere\n\nen+1 = (0, . . . , 0, 1) \u2208 Rn+1 .\n5\n\n\fRemark 3 If f is locally Lipschitz continuous, then it is easy to check that any stratification of\nGraph f must automatically satisfy (H). This\np might also happen for other functions (think of\nthe non-locally Lipschitz function f (x) = |x|: every stratification of Graph f should contain\nthe stratum Si = {(0, 0)}), however the example of the function f (x) = x3 shows that this is not\nthe case for any (continuous stratifiable) function f and any stratification of its graph (consider\nthe trivial stratification consisting of the single stratum Graph f and take u = (0, 0)).\nLet us denote by \u03a0 : Rn+1 \u2192 Rn the canonical projection on Rn , that is,\n\u03a0(x1 , . . . , xn , t) = (x1 , . . . , xn ).\nFor each i \u2208 I we set\n\nXi = \u03a0(Si )\n\nand\n\nfi = f |Xi .\n\n(8)\n\nDue to the above assumptions one has for all i \u2208 I\n- Xi is a C 1 submanifold of Rn ,\n- fi : Xi \u2192 R is a C 1 function.\n- X = (Xi )i\u2208I is a Whitney stratification of dom f = \u03a0(Graph f ).\nNotation. In the sequel, for any x \u2208 dom f, we shall denote by Xx (respectively, Sx ) the\nstratum of X (respectively of S) containing x (respectively (x, f (x))). The manifolds Xi are\nhere endowed with the metric induced by the canonical Euclidean scalar product of Rn . Using\nthe inherited Riemannian structure of each stratum Xi of X , for any x \u2208 Xi , we denote by\n\u2207R f (x) the gradient of fi at x with respect to the stratum Xi , h*, *i.\nProposition 4 (Projection formula) Let f : Rn \u2192 R \u222a {+\u221e} be a lower semicontinuous\nfunction and assume that Graph f admits a Whitney stratification S = (Si )i\u2208I satisfying (H).\nThen for all x \u2208 dom f we have\nProj Tx Xx \u2202f (x) \u2282 {\u2207R f (x)}\n\n;\n\nProj Tx Xx \u2202 \u221e f (x) = {0}\n\n(9)\n\nand\nProj Tx Xx \u2202 \u25e6 f (x) \u2282 {\u2207R f (x)},\n\n(10)\n\nwhere Proj V : Rn \u2192 V denotes the orthogonal projection on the vector subspace V of Rn .\nProof We shall use the above notation (and in particular the notation of (8)).\n\u02c6 (x) and the gradient of\nLet us first describe the links between the Fr\u00e9chet subdifferential \u2202f\nf |Xx at a point x \u2208 dom f . For any v \u2208 Tx Xx and any continuously differentiable curve\nc : (\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5) \u2192 Xx (\u03b5 > 0) with c(0) = x and \u010b(0) = v, the function\nf \u25e6 c (:= fi \u25e6 c) : (\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5) \u2192 R\nis continuously differentiable. In view of [21, Theorem 10.6, page 427], we have\n\u001b\n\u001a\nn\no\nd\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u02c6\nf (c(t)) |t=0 .\nhx , vi : x \u2208 \u2202f (x) \u2282\ndt\nSince\n\nd\ndt f (c(t))|t=0\n\n= h\u2207R f (x), vi it follows that\n\u02c6 (x) \u2282 {\u2207R f (x)}.\nProj Tx Xx \u2202f\n6\n\n(11)\n\n\fIn a second stage we prove successively that\nProj Tx Xx \u2202f (x) \u2282 {\u2207R f (x)} and\n\nProj Tx Xx \u2202 \u221e f (x) \u2282 {0}.\n\n(12)\n\n\u02c6 (xk ) be such that (xk , f (xk )) \u2192\n\u02c6 , x\u2217 \u2208 \u2202f\nTo this end, take p \u2208 \u2202f (x), and let {xk }k \u2282 dom \u2202f\nk\n\u2217\n(x, f (x)) and xk \u2192 p. Due to the local finiteness property of S, we may suppose that the\nsequence {uk := (xk , f (xk ))}k lies entirely in some stratum Si of dimension d.\n\nIf Si = Sx then by (11) we deduce that Proj Tx Xx (x\u2217k ) = \u2207R f (xk ), thus using the continuity of the projection and the fact that f |Xx is C 1 (that is, \u2207R f (xk ) \u2192 \u2207R f (x)) we obtain\nProj Tx Xx (p) = \u2207R f (x).\n\nIf Si 6= Sx , then from the convergence (xk , f (xk )) \u2192 (x, f (x)) we deduce that Si \u2229 Sx 6= \u2205\n(thus d = dim Si > dim Sx ). Using the compactness of the grassmannian manifold Gnd , we may\nassume that the sequence {Tuk Si }k\u22651 converges to some vector space T of dimension d. Then\nthe Whitney-(a) property yields that T \u2283 T(x,f (x)) Sx . Recalling (3), for each k \u2265 1 we have that\nthe vector (x\u2217k , \u22121) is Fr\u00e9chet normal to the epigraph epi f of f at uk , hence it is also normal (in\nthe classical sense) to the tangent space Tuk Si . By a standard continuity argument the vector\n(p, \u22121) = lim (x\u2217k , \u22121)\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nmust be normal to T and a fortiori to T(x,f (x)) Sx . By projecting (p, \u22121) orthogonally on Tx Xx +\nR en+1 \u2283 T(x,f (x)) Sx , we notice that (Proj Tx Xx (p), \u22121) is still normal to T(x,f (x)) Sx . By the\ndefinition of the subgradient we conclude that\nProj Tx Xx (p) = \u2207R f (x),\n\n(13)\n\nthus the first part of (12) follows.\n\u02c6 , y \u2217 \u2208 \u2202f\n\u02c6 (yk ) and\nLet now any q \u2208 \u2202 \u221e f (x). By definition there exist {yk }k \u2282 dom \u2202f\nk\na positive sequence tk \u0581 0+ such that (yk , f (yk )) \u2192 (y, f (y)) and tk yk\u2217 \u2192 q. As above we\nmay assume that the sequence {yk }k belongs to some stratum Si and that the tangent spaces\nTuk Si = T(xk ,f (xk )) Si converge to some T . Since tk (yk\u2217 , \u22121) is normal to Tuk Si we can similarly\ndeduce that (Proj Tx Xx (q), 0) is normal to T(x,f (x)) Sx . Since Proj Rn \u00d7{0} T(x,f (x)) Sx = Tx Xx this\nimplies that \u2202 \u221e f (x) \u2282 (Tx Xx )\u22a5 and the second part of (12) is proved. It now follows from (12)\nand Remark 2 (ii) that (9) holds.\nIn order to conclude let us recall (Definition 1) that \u2202 \u25e6 f (x) = co (\u2202f (x) + \u2202 \u221e f (x)). In view\nof (12) any element of co (\u2202f (x) + \u2202 \u221e f (x)) admits \u2207R f (x) as a projection onto Tx Xx . By\ntaking the closure of the previous set we obtain (10).\n\u0003\nRemark 4 The inclusion in (10) may be strict (think of the function f (x) = \u2212||x||1/2 at x = 0\nwhere \u2202 \u25e6 f (0) = \u2205). Of course, whenever \u2202 \u25e6 f (x) is nonempty (for example, if f is locally\nLipschitz), under the assumptions of Proposition 4 we have\nProj Tx Xx \u2202 \u25e6 f (x) = {\u2207R f (x)}.\nCorollary 5 Assume that the graph of f is closed and admits a C p -Whitney stratification satisfying (H). Then:\n7\n\n\f(i) for all x \u2208 dom \u2202 \u25e6 f we have\n||\u2207R f (x)|| \u2264 ||x\u2217 ||,\n\nfor all x\u2217 \u2208 \u2202 \u25e6 f (x).\n\n(14)\n\n(ii) (Morse-Sard theorem) If p \u2265 n, then the set of Clarke critical values of f has Lebesgue\nmeasure 0.\nProof Assertion (i) is a direct consequence of (10) of Proposition 4. To prove (ii), set C :=\n[\u2202 \u25e6 f ]\u22121 ({0}) = {x \u2208 Rn : \u2202 \u25e6 f (x) \u220b 0}. Since the set of strata is at most countable, the\nrestrictions of f to each of those yield a countable family {fn }n\u2208N of C p functions. In view of\n(14), we have that C \u2282 \u222an\u2208N \u2207fn\u22121 (0). The result follows by applying to each C p -function fn\nthe classical Morse-Sard theorem [22].\n\u0003\nAs we see in the next section, several important classes of lower semicontinuous functions satisfy\nthe assumptions (thus also the conclusions) of Proposition 4 and of Corollary 5.\n\n4\n\nKurdyka-Lojasiewicz inequalities for o-minimal functions\n\nLet us recall briefly a few definitions concerning o-minimal structures (see for instance, Coste [5],\nvan der Dries-Miller [8], Ta L\u00ea Loi [24], and references therein).\nDefinition 6 (o-minimal structure) An o-minimal structure on (R, +, .) is a sequence of\nboolean algebras On of \"definable\" subsets of Rn , such that for each n \u2208 N\n(i) if A belongs to On , then A \u00d7 R and R \u00d7 A belong to On+1 ;\n\n(ii) if \u03a0 : Rn+1 \u2192 Rn is the canonical projection onto Rn then for any A in On+1 , the set\n\u03a0(A) belongs to On ;\n(iii) On contains the family of algebraic subsets of Rn , that is, every set of the form\n{x \u2208 Rn : p(x) = 0},\nwhere p : Rn \u2192 R is a polynomial function ;\n\n(iv) the elements of O1 are exactly the finite unions of intervals and points.\n\nDefinition 7 (definable function) Given an o-minimal structure O (over (R, +, .)), a function f : Rn \u2192 R \u222a {+\u221e} is said to be definable in O if its graph belongs to On+1 .\nRemark 5 At a first sight, o-minimal structures might appear artificial in optimization. The\nfollowing properties (see [8] for the details) might convince the reader that this is not the case.\n(i) The collection of semialgebraic sets is an o-minimal structure. Recall that semialgebraic\nsets are Boolean combinations of sets of the form\n{x \u2208 Rn : p(x) = 0, q1 (x) < 0, . . . , qm (x) < 0},\nwhere p and qi 's are polynomial functions on Rn .\n(ii) There exists an o-minimal structure that contains the sets of the form\n{(x, t) \u2208 [\u22121, 1]n \u00d7 R : f (x) = t}\n8\n\n\fwhere f : Rn \u2192 R is real-analytic around [\u22121, 1]n .\n\n(iii) There exists an o-minimal structure that contains simultaneously the graph of the exponential function R \u220b x 7\u2192 exp x and all semialgebraic sets (respectively, the structure defined\nin (ii)).\nLet us finally recall the following important fact: the composition of mappings that are\ndefinable in some o-minimal structure remains in the same structure [8, Section 2.1]. This is\ntrue for the sum, the inf-convolution and several other classical operations of analysis involving\na finite number of definable objects. This remarkable stability, combined with new techniques of\nfinite-dimensional optimization offers a large field of investigation. Several works have already\nbeen developed in this spirit, see for instance [9], [1], [2].\nGiven any o-minimal structure O and any lower semicontinuous definable function f : Rn \u2192\nR \u222a {+\u221e} the assumptions of Proposition 4 are satisfied. More precisely, we have the following\nresult.\nLemma 8 Let B := {B1 , . . . , Bp } be a collection of definable subsets of Rn . Then there exists a definable C p -Whitney stratification {S1 , . . . , Sl } of the graph Graph f of f satisfying the\ntransversality condition (H) and yielding (by projecting each stratum Si \u2282 Rn+1 onto Rn ) a\nC p -Whitney stratification {X1 , . . . , Xl } of the domain dom f of f compatible with B.\nProof Let {\u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3m } be a C 1 -stratification of the definable set Graph f and set \u03a3i = \u03a0(\u03c3i )\nand Yi,j = \u03a3i \u2229 Bj for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m and 1 \u2264 j \u2264 p. Since the mapping \u03a0 : \u03c3i \u2192 \u03a3i is an open\ncontinuous one to one mapping, its inverse \u03a3i \u220b x \u2192 (x, f (x)) \u2208 \u03c3i is continuous and thus so\nis f |\u03a3i . Since the restriction f |Yi,j of f to each definable set Yi,j is continuous, there exists a\nC 1 -stratification {Zi,j,k }1\u2264k\u2264qi.j of each definable set Yi,j such that f |Zi,j,k is C 1 (see [5, Theorem\n6.7], [10] or [24] for example). Set\nAi,j,k = {(x, f (x)) : x \u2208 Zi,j,k }\nand consider a C p -Whitney stratification S = {S1 , . . . , Sl } of the definable set Graph f compatible with the definable sets Ai,j,k (see [24, Theorem 1.3], for example).\nS It is easily seen that\nS satisfies the transversality condition (H). Indeed, since dom f = i,j,k Zi,j,k , the relation\nen+1 \u2208 T(x,f (x)) Si for some x \u2208 dom f belonging say to the stratum Zi,j,k \u2282 Si is contradicting\nthe differentiability of f |Zi,j,k at x. Setting Xi = \u03a0(Si ), it is easily seen that the obtained\nC p -Whitney stratification X = {X1 , . . . , Xl } of dom f is compatible with the collection B. \u0003\nRemark 6 The aforementioned result can also be obtained by evoking more delicate results\non stratification of functions ([23], for example). We give an elementary proof for the reader's\nconvenience.\nCorollary 9 Let f : Rn \u2192 R \u222a {+\u221e} be a lower semicontinuous definable function. There\nexists a finite definable Whitney stratification X = (Xi )i\u2208I of dom f such that for all x \u2208 dom f\nProj Tx Xx \u2202 \u25e6 f (x) \u2282 { \u2207R f (x) }.\nAs a consequence\n9\n\n(15)\n\n\f(i) For all x \u2208 dom \u2202 \u25e6 f and x\u2217 \u2208 \u2202 \u25e6 f (x), we have ||\u2207R f (x)|| \u2264 ||x\u2217 || ;\n\n(ii) The set of Clarke critical values of f is finite ;\n\n(iii) The set of asymptotic Clarke critical values of f is finite.\nProof Assertion (i) is a direct consequence of (15). This projection formula follows directly\nby combining Lemma 8 with Proposition 4. To prove (iii), let fi be the restriction of f to the\nstratum Xi . Then assertion (i), together with the fact that the number of strata is finite, implies\nthat the set of the asymptotic Clarke critical values of f is the union (over the finite set I) of\nthe asympotic critical values of each (definable C 1 ) function fi . Thus the result follows from [6,\nRemarque 3.1.5]. Assertion (ii) follows directly from (iii) (cf. Remark 2 (iii)).\n\u0003\nRemark 7 The fact that the set of the asymptotic critical values of a definable differentiable\nfunction f is finite has been established in [6, Th\u00e9or\u00e8me 3.1.4] (see also [13, Theorem 3.1] for the\ncase that the domain of f is bounded). In [12, Proposition 2] a more general result (concerning\nfunctions taking values in Rk ) has been established in the semialgebraic case.\nBefore we proceed, let us recall from Kurdyka [12, Theorem 1] the following result:\nTheorem 10 (Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz inequality) Let f : U \u2192 R+ be a definable differentiable function, where U is an open and bounded subset of Rn .

Moreover, a careful\nexamination of the proof of [12, Theorem 1] shows that the result of Theorem 10 remains valid\nif U is any nonempty bounded definable submanifold of Rn .\nWe shall use Corollary 9 to extend Theorem 10 to a nonsmooth setting.\nTheorem 11 (Nonsmooth Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz inequality) Let f : Rn \u2192 R \u222a {+\u221e} be\na lower semicontinuous definable function and U be a bounded definable subset of Rn .

For each\ni \u2208 {1, . . . , l} such that Xi \u2282 U1 we consider the positive C 1 function fi := f |Xi on the definable\nmanifold Xi (thus for x \u2208 Xi we have \u2207fi (x) = \u2207R f (x) and fi (x) = f (x)) and we apply\nTheorem 10 (and Remark 8) to obtain \u03c1i > 0 and a strictly increasing definable C 1 -function\n\u03c8i : (0, \u03c1i ) \u2192 (0, +\u221e) such that for all x \u2208 fi \u22121 (0, \u03c1i ) we have ||\u2207R f (x)|| \u2265 [\u03c8i\u2032 (f (x))]\u22121 .\n10\n\n\fSimilarly, for each j \u2208 {1, . . . , l} such that Xj \u2282 U2 we consider the positive C 1 function\nfj := \u2212f |Xi (note that for x \u2208 Xj we have \u2207fj (x) = \u2212\u2207R f (x) and fj (x) = \u2212f (x)) to obtain\nas before \u03c1j > 0 and a strictly increasing definable C 1 -function \u03c8j : (0, \u03c1j ) \u2192 (0, +\u221e) such that\nfor all x \u2208 fj \u22121 (0, \u03c1i ) we have ||\u2207R f (x)|| \u2265 [\u03c8j\u2032 (\u2212f (x))]\u22121 . Thus for all i \u2208 {1, . . . , l} there exist\n\u03c1i > 0 and a strictly increasing definable C 1 -function \u03c8i : (0, \u03c1i ) \u2192 R such that\n||\u2207R f (x)|| \u2265\n\n1\n,\n\u03c8i\u2032 (|f (x)|)\n\nfor all x \u2208 U \u2229 |f |\u22121 (0, \u03c1i ).\n\nSet \u03c1 = min \u03c1i and let i1 , i2 \u2208 {1, . . . , l}. By the monotonicity theorem for definable functions\nof one variable (see [12, Lemma 2], for example), the definable function\n(0, \u03c1) \u220b r \u2192 1/\u03c8i\u20321 (r) \u2212 1/\u03c8i\u20322 (r)\nhas a constant sign in a neighborhood of 0. Repeating the argument for all couples i1 , i2 and\nshrinking \u03c1 if necessary, we obtain the existence of a strictly increasing, positive, definable\nfunction \u03c8 = \u03c8i0 on (0, \u03c1) of class C 1 that satisfies 1/\u03c8 \u2032 \u2264 1/\u03c8i\u2032 on (0, \u03c1) for all i \u2208 {1, . . . , l}.\nEvoking Corollary 9 (i), we obtain for all x \u2208 U \u2229 |f |\u22121 (0, \u03c1) and all x\u2217 \u2208 \u2202 \u25e6 f (x)\n||x\u2217 || \u2265 ||\u2207R f (x)|| \u2265\n\n1\n.\n\u03c8 \u2032 (|f (x))|\n\nSince \u03c8 is definable and bounded from below, it can be extended continuously to [0, \u03c1). By\nadding eventually a constant, we can also assume \u03c8(0) = 0.\n\u0003\nThe assumption that the function f is definable is important for the validity of (17). It\nimplies in particular that the connected components of the set of the Clarke critical points of f\nlie in the same level set of f (cf. Corollary 9 (ii)). Let us present some examples of C 1 -functions\nfor which (17) is not true.\nExample 1 (i) Consider the function f : R \u2192 R with\n\u001a 2\nx sin x1 , if x 6= 0\nf (x) =\n0,\nif x = 0\nThen the set S = {x \u2208 R : f \u2032 (x) = 0} meets infinite many level sets. Consequently, (17) is not\nfulfilled.\n(ii) A nontrivial example is proposed in [20, page 14], where a C \u221e \"Mexican-hat\" function has\nbeen defined. An example of a similar nature has been given in [1], and will be described below:\nLet f be defined in polar coordinate on R2 by\n\uf8f1\n4r 4\n1\n1\n\uf8f4\nif r \u2264 1\n\uf8f2 exp(\u2212 1\u2212r2 ) [1 \u2212 4r4 +(1\u2212r2 )4 sin(\u03b8 \u2212 1\u2212r2 )],\nf (r, \u03b8) =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n0,\nif r > 1.\nThe function f does not satisfy the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz inequality for the critical value 0, i.e.\none can not find a strictly increasing C 1 function \u03c8 : (0, \u03c1) \u2192 (0, +\u221e), with \u03c1 > 0, such that\n||\u2207(\u03c8 \u25e6 f )(x)|| \u2265 1\n11\n\n\ffor small positive values of f (x). To see this, let us notice that the proof of ([12, Theorem\n2]) shows that for any C1 function f (not necessarily definable) that satisfies the KurkykaLojasiewicz inequality, the bounded trajectories of the gradient system\n\u1e8b(t) + \u2207f (x(t)) = 0\nhave a bounded length. However, in the present example, taking as initial condition r0 \u2208 (0, 1)\nand \u03b80 such that \u03b80 (1 \u2212 r0 )2 = 1, the gradient trajectory \u1e8b(t) = \u2212\u2207f (x(t)) must comply with\n\u03b8(t) =\n\n1\n,\n1 \u2212 r(t)2\n\nwhere r(t) \u0580 1\u2212 as t \u2192 +\u221e (see [1] for details). The total length of the above curve is obviously\ninfinite, which shows that the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz inequality (for the critical value 0) does not\nhold.\nLet us finally give an easy consequence of Theorem 11 for the case of subanalytic functions.\nCorollary 12 (Subgradient inequality) Assume that f : Rn \u2192 R \u222a {+\u221e} is a lower semicontinuous globally subanalytic function and f (x0 ) = 0. Then there exist \u03b4 > 0 and \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 1)\nsuch that for all x \u2208 | f |\u22121 (0, \u03b4) we have\n|f (x)|\u03b8 \u2264 \u03c1 ||x\u2217 ||,\n\nfor all x\u2217 \u2208 \u2202 \u25e6 f (x).\n\nProof In case that f is globally subanalytic, one can apply [12, Theorem (LI)] to deduce that\nthe continuous function \u03c8 of Theorem 11 can be taken of the form \u03c8(s) = s1\u2212\u03b8 with \u03b8 \u2208 (0, 1).\n\u0003\nRemark 9 Corollary 9(ii) (and a fortiori Corollary 12) extends [2, Theorem 7] to the lower\nsemicontinuous case. We also remark that the conclusions of Theorem 11 and of Corollary 12\nremain valid for any notion of subdifferential that is included in the Clarke subdifferential, thus,\nin particular, in view of (7), for the Fr\u00e9chet and the limiting subdifferential. However, let us\npoint out that this is not the case for broader notions of subdifferentials, as for example the\nconvex-stable subdifferential introduced and studied in [3]. It is known that the convex-stable\nsubdifferential coincides with the Clarke subdifferential whenever the function f is locally Lipschitz continuous, but it is strictly larger in general, creating more critical points. In particular,\n[2, Section 4] constructs an example of a subanalytic continuous function on R3 that is strictly\nincreasing in a segment lying in the set of its broadly critical points (that is, critical in the sense\nof the convex-stable subdifferential). Consequently, Theorem 11 and Corollary 12 do not hold\nfor this subdifferential.\nAcknowledgment The second author wishes to thank K. Kurdyka and S. Simon for useful\ndiscussions.
