Introduction\nThere is an increasing demand for laser beams with uniform intensity distribution for material\nprocessing, lithography, medical applications, laser printing, optical data storage,\nmicromachining, isotope separation, optical processing, and other laboratory research [1]. The\n\n\fstudy of laser beam shaping has a long history and many papers on this subject can be found\nin the literature [1]. According to the chosen design method, beam shaping systems can be\ndivided into three broad categories: aperture, integrator and field mapping. This paper presents\nan analysis of a refractive field mapping system. Many authors discuss how refractive shapers\ntransform the laser beam intensity distribution [2-6]. A recent study shows that it is possible to\nshape an arbitrary beam profile into a desired one using only a single aspheric lens instead of\nthe commonly used two-lens system [2-3].\nAn important issue associated with the popular refractive beam shaper has recently drawn\nconsiderable attention, that is, how to minimize the destructive effect of diffraction on the\nbeam uniformity as it propagates through the distance needed for any practical application.\nHoffnagle and Jefferson proposed redistributing the whole beam to a continuous roll-off beam\nprofile [7~8]. Shealy and Hoffnagle considered output beam radiance distribution of four\nfamilies of functions (super-Gaussian, flattened Gaussian, Fermi\u2013Dirac, super-Lorentzian)\nand compared the propagation for each [9]. In this paper, we report a very important issue\nabout the shaper design that, to the best of our knowledge, has never been discussed before.\nWe refer to it as the \"singularity\" in the analytical solution of the shaper equations. In the\nfollowing sections we discuss the meaning of the \"singularity\" and how to both avoid and\nbenefit from this unexpected side effect. Finally, the \"surface boundary constraint\" will be\ndiscussed.\n\nn0\n\nn0\n\nn1\n\nn2\n(r2,Z2)\n\n(r1,Z1)\n\nInput\n\nn0\nOutput\n\nn0\n\nn\n\nn0\nOutput\n\nLens2\n\n(b)\n\nn0\n\nInput\n\nn2\n\nLens1\n\n(a)\n\nn0\n\nn0\n\nInput\n\nLens2\n\nLens1\n\nn1\n\nOutput\n\nn\n\nn0\n\nn0\nInput\n\nLens\n\nOutput\n\nLens\n\n(c)\n(d)\nFig. 1 Optical configurations of refractive laser beam shaper: (a) Galilean type,\n(b) Keplerian shaper, (c) Single-lens Galilean shaper, (d) Single-lens Keplerian shaper\n\n2. Shaper Design and \"Singular Radius\" Concept\nThe basic principle of laser beam shaping using a pair of aspheric lenses was proposed by\nFrieden [10] and Kreuzer [11], and later by Shealy and co-workers [12-13]. Fig. 1 shows an\noverview of the basic optical configurations of refractive beam shaper. For each case, a ray\nparallel to optical axis Z enters the first aspheric surface with arbitrary radius r1 , emerges\nfrom the second surface with radius r2 and is parallel to Z axis again. The terms Z1 ( r ) and\n\nZ 2 (r ) represent the first (front) and second (rear) surface profiles, respectively, n is the\nindex of refraction, and s is the distance between the vertex of the two surfaces. These beam\n\n\fshapers must all meet two requirements: (1) energy conservation, the total beam energy\nremains constant from the input to the output, and (2) equal optical path, all rays passing\nthrough the shaper from input pupil to output pupil have zero optical path difference (OPD).\nThese conditions guarantee the shaped beam is perfectly collimated at the output. Applying\nSnell's Law at each lens surface, surface profiles can be defined by the following relationship\nbetween r1 , Z1 (r ) , r2 and Z 2 ( r ) :\nType-1: Conventional two-lens Galilean shaper:\nr\n( n \u2212 1) s 2 \u2212 1 / 2\n) ]\nZ 1 ( r ) = \u222b [( n 2 \u2212 1) + (\ndr1\n0\nr2 \u2212 r1\n\n(1a)\n\n(n \u2212 1) s 2 \u22121/ 2\n) ] dr2\nr2 \u2212 r1\n\n(1b)\n\nZ 2 (r ) = \u222b [(n 2 \u2212 1) + (\nr\n\n0\n\nType-2: Two-lens Keplerian shaper:\n\n(n \u2212 1) s 2 \u22121/ 2\n) ] dr1\nr2 + r1\nr\n(n \u2212 1) s 2 \u22121/ 2\n) ] dr2\nZ 2 (r ) = \u222b [(n 2 \u2212 1) + (\n0\nr2 + r1\nr\n\nZ1 (r ) = \u222b [(n 2 \u2212 1) + (\n0\n\n(2a)\n(2b)\n\nType-3: Single-lens Galilean shaper:\n\n(n \u2212 1) s 2 \u22121/ 2\n) ] dr1\nr2 \u2212 r1\nr\n(n \u2212 1) s 2 \u22121/ 2\n) ] dr2\nZ 2 (r ) = \u222b n[\u2212(n 2 \u2212 1) + (\n0\nr2 \u2212 r1\nr\n\nZ1 (r ) = \u222b n[\u2212(n 2 \u2212 1) + (\n0\n\n(3a)\n(3b)\n\nType-4: Single-lens Keplerian shaper:\n\n(n \u2212 1) s 2 \u22121/ 2\n) ] dr1\nr2 + r1\nr\n(n \u2212 1) s 2 \u22121/ 2\n) ] dr2\nZ 2 (r ) = \u222b n[\u2212(n 2 \u2212 1) + (\n0\nr2 + r1\nr\n\nZ1 (r ) = \u222b n[\u2212(n 2 \u2212 1) + (\n0\n\n(4a)\n(4b)\n\nIt is assumed the input beam radiance is a normalized Gaussian profile f ( r ) and output\nbeam is a super-Gaussian\n\ng (r ) . The relationship between r1 and r2 is determined by the\n\nenergy conservation condition. To avoid diffraction effects, the shaper radius was designed to\nbe 5.7mm so that the radiance of the input Gaussian beam at the edge of the shaper is e-7 of the\npeak value. In our design, input beam size was set with w=3mm. The parameter R, a length\nscale approximately the radius of a flattop for P>2, is 4mm, together with the dimensionless\norder parameter P=8, define the output super-Gaussian radiance profile:\n\ng (r ) = g 0 exp(\u22122(r / R) P )\ng0 =\n\n(5)\n\n2/ P\n\n2 P\n2\u03c0 R 2 \u0393(2 / P)\n\n(6)\n\nAfter straight-forward analytical derivation using the energy conservation requirement a\nsecond critical design equation is obtained,\nr2\n9\nr1 = h(r2 ) = \u2212 ln(1 \u2212 2\u03c0 \u222b g (r )rdr )\n0\n2\n\n(7)\n\n\fThe above equations define the specific aspheric surface profiles for the corresponding\nshaping system. It needs to be pointed out that Eqs. 1a, 1b are from Ref. 11, Eqs. 5, 6 are from\nRef. 9 and we further derived Eq. 2a through Eq. 4b and Eq. 7 for different shaper\nconfigurations. Compared with the differential equations used in traditional shaper design\nthese equations are quite lucid and could be solved analytically for special cases, for example,\nthe Gaussian to super-Gaussian transformation. The use of these equations in a design will be\npresented later. It is worthwhile to mention that Eq. 7 applies to all four design types listed\nabove.\n0.4\n\n1\n\nFront Surface\nRear Surface\nSag(mm)\n\nSag(mm)\n\n0.3\n\nFront surface\nRear surface\n\n0.8\n\n0.2\n0.1\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n3\nRadius(mm)\n\n(a)\n\n4\n\n5\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n3\nRadius(mm)\n\n4\n\n5\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 2 Sag curves for the two single-lens beam shapers, (a) R=4mm, and (b) R=5mm.\n\nConsider, as an example, a Type-3 shaping system with 30mm lens thickness of BK7 glass\nand design wavelength of 532nm. The surface profiles for two different design output beam\nsizes characterized by R=4mm and R=5mm are shown in Fig. 2(a) and 2(b); alongside\nsimulation results for R=4mm using a ray tracing program (ZEMAX). Both designs produce\nhigh quality flat-top patterns. Fig. 3 shows the radiance distributions for R=4mm. Note in Fig.\n2a there is a turning point near r =3.8mm where, for the R=4mm curve, the first derivative\ndZ / dr = 0 . In this case, both the front and rear surfaces are no longer monotonic in terms of\noptical element smoothness. However, the curve for R=5mm is monotonic and quite normal.\nThe occurrence of a tuning point is highly undesirable because it incurs unnecessary\ncomplication, adding particular difficulty in data processing and optical fabrication. Although\nthe turning point is near the edge of the aspherical surface, it is not a location at which either\nthe input or the output radiance may be ignored. For the case R=4mm, the intensity at the\nturning point ( r =3.8mm) of the input beam is about 4% of the peak value, yet over 26.5% for\nthe output beam! For convenience, we define the radius where the turning point appears as\nthe \"singular radius\" and next discuss its interpretation.\n\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 3 Input and output beam radiance distributions for R=4mm in Fig. 2(a),\n(a) Input profile, (b) Output profile\n\n\f5\n\nSingular Radius(mm)\n\n4\n\nRadius1(mm)\n\n5.5\n\nr1=h(r2)\nr1=r2\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nRadius2(mm)\n\nr1\n\nand\n\n4.5\n\n4\n\n3.5\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nW(mm)\n\nFig. 4 Curve showing the relation\nbetween\n\n5\n\n5\n\nr2 .\n\nFig. 5 Singular radius changes\nwith initial beam size\n\nIt is not difficult to understand the nature of the singular radius. For example, consider the\nType-1 and Type-3 shapers. The function of a beam shaper is to uniformly distribute the input\nbeam energy over the designated output surface area. For rays near the optical axis, their\nradiance is higher than those near the surface edge. Consequently, rays at smaller radius r1\non the front surface tend to defocus more than those at larger r1 , ending at with larger value\nof r2 on the rear surface. This situation is reversed for those rays near the surface edge since\nthe shaped flat-top radiance should be between the center peak and the lower wing of the\noriginal Gaussian input radiance. It is easy to imagine there must be a point where the input\nray will pass straight through the optical material and reach the rear surface without any\nfocusing or defocusing. In other words, the incident ray from r1 will travel parallel to the\noptical axis, indicating r1 = r2 . In comparison, rays towards the edge are bent at a larger angle\nfor Type-2 and Type-4 shapers, so there is no other straight ray except the center ray on\noptical axis where r1 = r2 =0. A straight-forward way to predict the presence of the singular\nradius is to make a plot like that shown in Fig. 4, where the singular radius is obtained at the\nintersection point of a line ( r1 = r2 ) and the curve defined by Eq. 7. Analysis of the\nrelationship between singular radius and other parameters of the shaping system are presented\nbelow. We show that it is possible to eliminate the singular radius from Type-1 and Type-3\ndesigns.\n3. Analysis\nFor the sake of simplicity and consistency, we change only one parameter in the following\ndiscussion regarding a Type-3 shaper. In addition, we focus on the singular radius at the rear\nsurface because the singular radii are always equal.\n3.1 Initial beam size (w)\nThe dependence of the singular radius with initial beam size in Fig. 5 demonstrates that the\nsmaller input beam size results in a larger singular radius. When w is decreased to about\n1.4mm, singular radius moves far from our desired output beam size range. As explained\nabove, the smaller input beam tends to defocus more in order to redistribute the total energy\nonto a given surface area. When the area ratio between the input and output beams reaches a\nthreshold, even rays near the edge of the input beam will not focus. The consequence is that\nthe singular radius cannot occur. This indicates an important criterion for designing shaper\nsystems: the use of a smaller input beam helps to eliminate the singular radius for a given\n\n\foutput aperture.\n3.2 Lens thickness ( s )\nThe singular radius hardly changes as the lens thickness varies, however, the surface profiles\nshow significant differences, as demonstrated in Fig. 6. The curve becomes more monotonic\nas the lens thickness increases. The reason the singular radius does not change with s is\nclear: singularity occurs when r1 equals r2 , and is solely determined by Eq. 7 which has no\ndependency on lens thickness.\n\n,\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\nn=1.461\nn=1.519\nn=1.795\n\n0.3\n\nSag(mm)\n\nSag(mm)\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\ns=30mm\ns=50mm\ns=80mm\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n0\n\n5\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nRadius(mm)\n\nRadius(mm)\n\nFig. 7 Sag curves of rear surface for\ndifferent index of refractive. s =30mm.\n\nFig. 6 Sag curves of rear surface\nfor different lens thickness\n\n5\n\n3.3 Index of refraction ( n )\nThe dependency of the singular radius on material refraction index presents a very similar\npicture as that for lens thickness. The reason is the same as explained in 2). From Fig. 7 we\ncan see in this case the change of n won't make the surface profile get closer to monotonic.\nWith larger n , the sag value does decease, though. This helps to facilitate the optical\nfabrication.\n3.4 Output beam parameters P and R\n\n5\n\n4\n\n4\n\n3\n\nSag(mm)\n\nSingular Radius(mm)\n\nFortuitously, the super-Gaussian order parameter (P) does not influence the singular radius. In\nthis specific design, the singular radius ( r =3.8mm) is somewhat smaller than the length scale\nparameter (R=4mm) which means the singular radius is along the ramp to the flattop profile.\nThis is true for all design parameters. It is true also that the ramp of the output beam does not\nmove much with order parameter however the slope does change. Consequently, the singular\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n2.5\n\n2\n\n1\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\nR for Super-Gaussian output(mm)\n\nFig. 8 Singular radius changes\nwith output beam parameter R\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nRadius(mm)\n\nFig. 9 Surface profile showing the\nboundary constraint for type-4 shaper\n\n\fradius does not change significantly with P over a range of interest (P>8 for good uniformity\nand P<20 for diffraction suppression). However, as shown in Fig. 8, it would be extremely\ndifficult to design a shaper which preserves a small beam while flattening the radiance profile,\nand difficult to constrict the beam while shaping.\nIn a similar manner, the singular radii for Type-1 and Type-3 shaping system used to create\nother output beam profiles-for example, Fermi-Dirac, Flattened-Gaussian and\nSuper-Lorentzian, even from an arbitrary input profile to an arbitrary output profile, can be\ntreated.\n4. Surface boundary\nAlthough neither Type-2 nor Type-4 shapers have singular radii, there is another concern\nassociated with Type-3 and Type-4 configurations. The slope of the lens surface (dr/dZ) may\nbecome very small or even reach zero at a radius at which the integrand in (3) and (4) goes to\ninfinity. At the same location, the surface becomes parallel with the optical axis. This is\nequivalent to the incident angle reaching the critical angle for total reflection. The sag for a\nType-4 shaper that converts the input beam (W=3mm) into a super-Gaussian output beam\n(P=8, R=6mm) is shown in Fig. 9, the lens separation is now 15mm. As we can see, the\nsurface ends at radius less than 4mm. Therefore, there is no room for extending the shaper\noutput aperture in order to minimize diffraction effects which may severely affect the beam\npattern within a certain distance. This leads to a very important boundary issue for Type-3 and\nType-4 shapers. We discuss the two types separately:\n1) Type-3\nThis type of shaper can be divided into two configurations: one a diverging shaper with\nconcave front surface and convex rear surface, the other a converging shaper with convex\nfront and concave rear. Differences between corresponding r1 and r2 of the converging\nshaper could be big enough to meet the following condition; however, it is not possible for the\ndiverging case. The surface ends as the integrand in Eq. 3 goes to infinity,\n\nn \u22121\ns\nn +1\n\nr1 \u2212 r2 =\n\n(8)\n\nClearly, with short lens thickness s the surface terminates at a radius far enough from the\noptical axis, and it will go further when s increases, which is revealed by Fig. 10.\n2) Type-4\n10\n\nr1=h(r2)\ns=10mm\ns=5mm\ns=2mm\n\nRadius1(mm)\n\nRadius1(mm)\n\n10\n\n5\n\nr1=h(r2)\ns=15mm\ns=20mm\ns=30mm\n0\n\n5\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nRadius2(mm)\n\nFig. 11 Shaper surface boundary changes\nwith lens thickness for type-4 shaper\n\nIn this case the boundary equation will be\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nRadius2(mm)\n\nFig. 10 Dependency of type-3 beam shaper\nsurface boundary on different lens thickness\n\n\fn \u22121\n(9)\ns\nn +1\nThe calculation is shown in Fig. 11. As lens thickness s is increased the surface extends\nfurther outward. For s <15mm, the constraint is fairly rigorous for the design. It is easy to see\nr1 + r2 =\n\nthat more attention needs to be taken when designing Type-4 than Type-3, because a Type-4\nshaper inherently has faster bending surface profile. As we know, short spacing s is\ndesirable for ultra short pulse laser beam shaping and a larger aperture is much easier to\nfabricate and desirable for diffraction suppression. Due to the boundary constraint it is\nnecessary to analyze the compromise between spacing and aperture in order to optimize a\nspecific design.\n5. Summary\nWe have introduced the concept of \"singular radius\" in this paper along with detailed\ndiscussions about the surface boundary constraint on the refractive shaper design. By\nanalyzing the issues and influence by other parameters we put forward practical measures to\neliminate such problems from the design process. To the best of our knowledge these issues\nand the study presented in this paper have not been reported elsewhere in the literatures. We\nbelieve this paper provides very useful guidelines against possible design errors that could\notherwise degrade shaper performance or add undesired complication into the system.\nAcknowledgement\nThis work is supported by the Office of Naval Research, the Joint Technology Office, the\nCommonwealth of Virginia, the Air Force Research Laboratory, and by DOE Contract\nDE-AC05-060R23177.
