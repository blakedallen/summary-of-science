DE CASTRO\nDFQ, UNESP, C.P. 205, 12500-000 Guaratinguet\u00e1 SP, Brasil\nE-mail: castro@feg.unesp.br\nJ. FRANKLIN\nDepartment of Physics, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA\nE-mail: v5030e@vm.temple.edu\nExact analytic solutions are found to the Dirac equation for a combination of\nLorentz scalar and vector Coulombic potentials with additional non-Coulombic\nparts. An appropriate linear combination of Lorentz scalar and vector nonCoulombic potentials, with the scalar part dominating, can be chosen to give exact\nanalytic Dirac wave functions.\n\nIn a previous letter,1 simple exact solutions were found for the Dirac equation for the combination of a Lorentz vector Coulomb potential with a linear\nconfining potential that was a particular combination of Lorentz scalar and\nvector parts. In this work, we extend the method of Ref. 1 to the more general\ncase of an arbitrary combination of Lorentz scalar and vector Coulombic potentials with a particular combination of Lorentz scalar and vector non-Coulombic\npotentials. A more complete version of this work will appear elsewhere.2\nThe Dirac equation we solve is\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03bb + \u03b2\u03b7\n\u03b1 * p + \u03b2m \u2212\n+ V (r) + \u03b2S(r) \u03c8 = E\u03c8,\n(1)\nr\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the usual Dirac matrices. The four component wave function\n\u03c8 can be written in terms of two component spinors u (upper component) and\nv (lower component) satisfying the equations\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03bb+\u03b7\n(\u03c3 * p)v = E \u2212 m +\n\u2212 V (r) \u2212 S(r) u\n(2)\nr\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03bb\u2212\u03b7\n\u2212 V (r) + S(r) v.\n(3)\n(\u03c3 * p)u = E + m +\nr\nThe key step in generating relatively simple exact solutions of the Dirac equation is to choose a particularly simple form for the function v(r). For s-states,a\nwe choose v(r) = i\u03b3(\u03c3 * r\u0302)u(r), where \u03b3 is a constant factor to be determined\na States\n\nwith orbital angular momentum are treated in Ref. 2.\n\n1\n\n\fby the solution to the Dirac equation. This is the form of v(r) that was found\nin Ref. 1 for a Coulomb plus linear confining potential. This ansatz for v(r) has\nalso been used as the basis for generating approximate saddle point solutions\nfor the Dirac3 and Breit4 equations. Using this form of v(r), equations (2) and\n(3) reduce to two first order ordinary diffential equations for u(r)\n\u0014\n\u0015\ndu\n\u03bb + \u03b7 \u2212 2\u03b3\n1\nE \u2212 m \u2212 V (r) \u2212 S(r) +\nu(r)\n(4)\n=\ndr\n\u03b3\nr\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03bb\u2212\u03b7\ndu\nu(r).\n(5)\n= \u2212\u03b3 E + m \u2212 V (r) + S(r) +\ndr\nr\nEquations (4) and (5) are two independent equations for the same quantity, so\nthat each term in one equation can be equated with the corresponding term\nin the other equation having the same radial dependence. This leads to\n\u03b32 =\n\nm\u2212E\nS(r) + V (r)\n\u03bb + \u03b7 \u2212 2\u03b3\n=\n=\n.\nm+E\nS(r) \u2212 V (r)\n\u03b7\u2212\u03bb\n\n(6)\n\nThe relations in Eq. (6) can be rearranged, after some algebra, to give\n\u03b3=\n\np\n\u03bb+\u03b7\n, b = \u00b1 1 \u2212 \u03bb2 + \u03b7 2\n1+b\n\n(7)\n\nThe constant b can have either sign. Although b must be positive in the pure\nCoulombic case, we will see that a negative b is possible if the Lorentz scalar\npotential S(r) is more singular at the origin than 1/r. The bound state energy\ncan be written as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 \u2212 \u03b32\nV (r)\nb\u03bb \u2212 \u03b7\nE=m\n= \u2212m\n=\nm\n.\n(8)\n2\n1+\u03b3\n\u03bb \u2212 b\u03b7\nS(r)\nThe wave function u(r) can be found by solving Eq. (5) to give\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0013\u0015\nZ\n1\nu(r) = rb\u22121 exp \u2212a r +\nS(r)dr ,\n(9)\nm\n\u221a\nwhere the constant a is given by a = \u03b3(m + E) = \u00b1 m2 \u2212 E 2 . The constants\n\u03b3 and a can have either sign if S(r) approaches a constant or diverges as r\nbecomes infinite. The integral in Eq. (9) can diverge for any finite r, as long as\nthe product of a times the integral diverges in the positive sense. The integral\ncan also diverge at the origin or as r \u2192 \u221e as long as the quantity in square\nbrackets in Eq. (9) remains negative.\n2\n\n\fThe last equality in Eq. (8) shows that in order for this class of exact\nsolutions to apply, the Lorentz vector and scalar non-Coulombic potentials\nmust have the same radial dependence and opposite sign, with the vector\npotential being smaller than the scalar potential. As long as this constraint\nis satisfied, the results in Eqs. (7)-(9) represent a complete exact solution for\nthe ground state wave function and energy of the Dirac Hamiltonian given in\nequation (1).\nBecause of the constraints imposed on the potentials by Eq. (8), the energy\ncan be written purely in terms of one set of potentials or the other. The\nground state energy can be specified by the Coulombic constants \u03bb and \u03b7,\nwith the other equality in Eq. (8) serving as a constraint on the non-Coulombic\npotentials V (r) and S(r). Or the ground state energy could be specified by\nthe ratio V (r)/S(r) of the non-Coulombic potentials with the other equality\nserving as a constraint on \u03bb and \u03b7. Although the possibility of this class of\nexact solutions is limited by the constraints on the potentials, this still permits\na wide range of non-Coulombic potentials.\nWe now consider conditions imposed on the potentials and the wave function parameters by the physical requirements that the potentials be real and\nthe wave function normalizable. We see from Eq. (6) that \u03b3 must be real, and\nthen from Eq. (7) that b must be real. This requires the Coulombic potentials\nto satisfy the condition 1 \u2212 \u03bb2 + \u03b7 2 \u2265 0. The reality of \u03b3 restricts possible\nbound state energies to the range \u2212m < E < m. Note that negative energies\ncan occur, but E + m cannot be negative. Also, E cannot equal \u00b1m, because\nthis would make \u03b3 = 0, leading to a constant, unormalizable wave function.\nThis condition on E, along with Eq. (9), means that V (r) must always be less\nin magnitude than S(r).\nWe discuss the remaining conditions on the parameters in terms of three\nsub-classes of solution:\n1. The \"normal\" class of solutions has b, \u03b3, and a all positive. In this case,\nwe see from Eq. (7) that the Coulombic potentials must satisfy the further\ncondition \u03bb + \u03b7 > 0.\n2. This sub-case has b negative, with \u03b3 and a still positive. The constant b\ncan be negative if the product aS(r) is positively divergent at the origin faster\nthan 1/r. Then each of Eqs. (7)-(10) hold just as for positive b, and the wave\nfunction is still normalizable. The states with positive and negative b are not\ntwo ground states of the same Hamiltonian because the potentials cannot be\nthe same for each state. That is, either the Coulombic potentials or the nonCoulombic potentials must change to be consistent with a negative b. Sub-case\n1 with positive b transforms smoothly into the pure Coulombic solution as the\nnon-Coulombic potential tends to zero everywhere. But this is not true for sub3\n\n\fcase 2 with b negative. This sub-case requires the non-Coulombic potential to\nbe dominant at the origin, and so has no corresponding pure Coulombic limit.\n3. This sub-case has a negative \u03b3 and a negative a, while b can have either\nsign, as discussed in sub-cases 1 and 2 above. A negative a is possible if the\nnon-Coulombic potential diverges or approaches a constant as r \u2192 \u221e, so that\nthe integral in Eq. (9) diverges faster than r at large r. Since a is negative,\nthe potential S(r) must be negative at large r. Then all of Eqs. (7)-(10) hold\nas for positive a, and the wave function is still normalizable. This case is\nhighly unusual, because it allows the possibility of a potential that is negative\neverywhere and diverges negatively at both the origin and infinite r. We know\nof no other example in quantum mechanics where such a negative potential\ncan lead to a normalizable ground state. The reason this is possible here can\nbe seen from Eqs. (4) and (5). There it is seen that S(r) enters the differential\nequations for u(r) only in the combinations \u03b3S(r) or S(r)/\u03b3. Since these\neffective potentials are positive, the resulting wave function is normalizable.\nAs with sub-case 2, the case with \u03b3 and a negative does not approach a pure\nCoulombic case if the non-Coulombic potential tends to zero.\nWe now look at some special cases. If the non-Coulombic potentials are\nabsent, then the solutions are for a general linear combination of Lorentz vector\nand Lorentz scalar Coulombic potentials. If either constant, \u03bb or \u03b7, is zero,\nwe recover the usual solutions of the Dirac equation for a pure scalar or vector\nCoulombic potential. The Coulombic potentials cannot both be absent (while\nkeeping a non-Coulombic part) because then \u03b3 would be zero leading to a\nconstant, unnormalizable wave function.\nThe method we have described does not work for radially excited states,\nbecause the simple ansatz for v(r) does not lead to consistent equations for\ndu/dr in that case. The method does work for the lowest orbitally excited\nstate for which l = j \u2212 12 . That case is discussed in Ref. 2.\nAcknowledgments\nOne of the authors (A.S.C.) would like thank FAPESP for financial support.\nReferences\n1. J. Franklin, Mod. Phys. Lett. A 14, 2409 (1999).\n2. A.
