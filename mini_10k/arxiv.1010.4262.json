The introduction of \u03bb required only the addition of the divergence-free term \u2212\u03bbg\u03bc\u03bd to the original\nfield equations:\n1\nG\u03bc\u03bd = R\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 Rg \u03bc\u03bd = 8\u03c0GT \u03bc\u03bd \u2192 G\u03bc\u03bd = 8\u03c0GT \u03bc\u03bd \u2212\u03bbg \u03bc\u03bd ,\n2\nwhere R\u03bc\u03bd is the Ricci curvature of g\u03bc\u03bd , and T\u03bc\u03bd is the\nenergy-momentum tensor of matter. It was not an easy\nmatter to unambiguously interpret the astronomical data\nconcerning galaxy motions and attribute them to systematic recession rather than a steady lateral drift. The first\nobservations of galaxy redshifts were made by Slipher in\n1912 [2]. By 1917, Slipher had measured the redshifts of\n25 spiral galaxies; all but four of them were found to be\nreceding from us [3]. In 1917 de Sitter [4] found an empty\nexpanding solution with a \u03bb term present and in the early\n1920s, Friedmann discovered a class of homogeneous and\nisotropic cosmological solutions of general relativity without a \u03bb term. These cosmological models were not static\nbut could either expand or contract. Lema\u0131\u0302tre found a\nwide range of expanding and contracting universes, both\nwith and without \u03bb in 1927 and also predicted the theoretical relationship between distance and redshift in an\nexpanding universe [6, 7]. Notably, Lema\u0131\u0302tre proposed\nthat an expanding universe could explain the velocities\n\nof galaxies first measured by Slipher and first deduced\nwhat became known as 'Hubble's Law' (unfortunately\nthe translation [6] omitted the crucial footnote where it\nappears in the original). Two years later, Hubble and\nHumason empirically derived the redshift-distance relation [10]. This led to the static universe model, which\nfirst motivated Einstein to introduce \u03bb, being abandoned\nin favour of the now familiar expanding universe cosmology. Lema\u0131\u0302tre had also demonstrated the instability of\nthe static universe model with respect to conformal perturbations. Unaware of Lema\u0131\u0302tre's work, Eddington had\nalso proved the instability of the static universe against\ndensity perturbations [8] (the full stability analysis was\nonly completed in 2003 and can be found in [9]). However, some scientists, notably Eddington, believed that\n\u03bb was a n essential part of general relativity because it\noffered a possible link between gravitation and microphysics [11, 12].\nWhilst the original motivation for a CC evaporated, it\nwas later appreciated that there were other, more fundamental reasons for its presence (see e.g. Ref. [13] for a\ndiscussion of this and for a modern review see Ref. [14]).\nQuantum fluctuations result in a vacuum energy, \u03c1vac ,\nwhich contributes to the expected value of the energy\nmomentum tensor of matter:\n\u03bc\u03bd\nhT \u03bc\u03bd i = Tm\n\u2212 \u03c1vac g \u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\nwhere Tm\nvanishes in vacuo. The quantum expectation\nof the energy-momentum tensor, hT \u03bc\u03bd i, acts as a source\nfor the Einstein tensor. Hence, we have:\n\u03bc\u03bd\nG\u03bc\u03bd = 8\u03c0GTm\n\u2212 \u039bg \u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: d.shaw@damtp.ac.uk\n\u2020 Electronic address: j.d.barrow@damtp.cam.ac.uk\n\n\u039b = \u03bb + 8\u03c0G\u03c1vac .\n\nIt is clear from this that the vacuum energy, \u03c1vac , provides a contribution, 8\u03c0G\u03c1vac , to the effective cosmological constant, \u039b. Even if the 'bare' cosmological constant\n\n\f2\nis assumed to vanish, \u03bb = 0, the effective cosmological\nconstant will generally be non-zero. Requiring that \u039b = 0\nmeans there must be an exact cancellation of the 'bare'\ncosmological constant, \u03bb, and the vacuum energy stress,\n8\u03c0G\u03c1vac .\nFormally, the value of \u03c1vac predicted by a general quantum field theory in a flat Minkowski space background is\ninfinite. If we assume that the field theory is only valid\nup to some energy scale M\u2217 , then there is a contribution to \u03c1vac of O(M\u22174 ). Collider experiments have established that the standard model is accurate up to energy\nscales M\u2217 & O(MEW ) where MEW \u2248 246 GeV is the electroweak scale. We would therefore expect \u03c1vac to be at\n4\nleast O(MEW\n).\nIn the absence of any new physics between the electroweak and the Planck scale, Mpl = 2.4 \u00d7 1018 GeV,\nwhere quantum fluctuations in the gravitational field\ncan no longer be safely neglected, we would expect\n4\n\u03c1vac \u223c O(Mpl\n). Astrophysical observations do, however, strongly suggest there exists some new form of\ndark, weakly interacting matter, beyond that described\nby the standard model. The most developed theoretical extensions of the standard model, which include candidates for this dark matter, introduce an additional\nsupersymmetry (SUSY) between fermions and bosons.\nIf supersymmetry were an unbroken symmetry of Nature, the quantum contributions to the vacuum energy\nwould all exactly cancel leaving \u03c1vac = 0 \u21d2 \u039b = \u03bb.\nHowever, our universe is not supersymmetric today, and\nso SUSY must have been broken at some energy scale\nMSUSY , where 1 TeV . MSUSY . Mpl and so we expect\n4\n\u03c1vac \u223c O(MSUSY\n).\nGiven the standard model of particle physics and rea4\nsonable extensions of it, a \u03c1vac somewhere between MEW\n4\nand Mpl appears unavoidable. Furthermore, in the absence of exact cancellations, we would expect the effective\nvacuum energy,\n\u03c1eff\nvac =\n\n\u03bb\n\u039b\n+ \u03c1vac \u2261\n,\n8\u03c0G\n8\u03c0G\n\nto be no smaller than \u03c1vac , giving an estimate of \u03c1eff\nvac &\n4\nO(MEW\n). This cannot, however, be the case.\nThe expansion rate of our universe is sensitive to \u03c1eff\nvac ,\nor equivalently \u039b, through Einstein's equations. Measurements of this expansion rate have established that\n\u00011/4\n\u2248 2.4 \u00b1 0.3 \u00d7 10\u221212 GeV [15] and this implies\n\u03c1eff\nvac\neff\nthat \u03c1vac is some 1060 \u2212 10120 times smaller than the\nexpected contribution from quantum fluctuations.\nThis gives rise to the cosmological constant problem:\n\"Why is the measured effective vacuum energy or cosmological constant so much smaller than the expected\ncontributions to it from quantum fluctuations?\" Equivalently, assuming the estimate of \u03c1vac from quantum fluctuations is accurate: \"Why does the approximate equality \u03bb \u2248 \u22128\u03c0G\u03c1vac hold good to an accuracy of somewhere\nbetween 60 to 120 decimal places?\" A fuller exposition\nand review of the cosmological constant problem and ear-\n\nlier attempts at its solution can be found in Weinberg in\nRef. [14].\nObservations of the cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) [15], Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) [17\u201320], and\nlarge scale structure (LSS) [21, 22] all strongly prefer a small (but non-zero) value for \u03c1eff\nvac : specifically,\n\u22126\n\u03c1eff\nGeV cm\u22123 [15]. This presents an\nvac = (3.8\u00b10.2)\u00d710\nadditional conundrum; it is easier to conceive a situation\nwhere |\u03c1vac + \u039b/8\u03c0G| is exactly zero, than one in which\nthe cancellation between the two terms is very nearly exact. This is related to the coincidence problem which we\ndescribe in more detail below.\nThe presence of an (effective) cosmological constant,\n\u039b, introduces a fixed time-scale: t\u039b = \u039b\u22121/2 . Curiously,\nthe observed value of t\u039b \u2248 9.3 Gyrs is of the same order as the age of universe today tU \u2248 13.7 Gyrs. This\ngives rise to the coincidence problem: \"Why is t\u039b \u223c tU\ntoday?\" The epoch at which we observe the universe is\nconditioned by the requirement that the universe be old\nenough for typical stars to have experienced a period\nof stable hydrogen burning and then produce the heavier elements required for biological complexity [16]. The\ncharacteristic time-scale, t\u2217 , over which this occurs is determined by a combination of the constants of nature:\nt\u2217 \u223c \u03b12em /Gmp me = 5.7 Gyrs [23]. Naturally, one expects that tU \u223c O(1)t\u2217 , which is indeed the case. Thus,\nthe coincidence problem can be alternatively viewed as\nthe coincidence of two fundamental time scales, t\u039b and\nt\u2217 , determined entirely by fundamental constants of Nature. The coincidence problem is then simply \"Why is\nt\u039b \u223c t\u2217 ?\"\nThe coincidence problem is puzzling because it implies\nthat we live at a special epoch tU when, by chance t\u039b \u223c\nO(tU \u223c t\u2217 ), or that there is some deep reason, related to\nthe solution of the cosmological constant problem, why\n\u039b is such that t\u039b \u223c t\u2217 (\u223c tU ).\nRecently, in the field of cosmology, there has been more\nliterature addressing the coincidence problem than the\ncosmological constant problem. It is generally assumed\n(or perhaps hoped) that there is a dynamical mechanism\nthat ensures that \u03c1eff\nvac = \u03c1vac + \u03bb/8\u03c0G vanishes exactly.\nThe observed effective cosmological constant then comes\nabout due to some other mechanism e.g. the energy density of a slowly rolling scalar field. In dark energy models, for instance, the effective cosmological constant is\nnot actually constant. Instead there is a additional field\n(the eponymous dark energy) whose energy density has\ncaused the expansion of the universe to accelerate in such\na way that is, up to current measurement accuracy, indistinguishable from the effect of a cosmological constant.\nWhilst some dark energy models can alleviate the coincidence problem, they invariably feature a high degree of\nfine tuning to ensure that the transition to a dark energy\ndominated expansion occurs at a time scale \u223c O(t\u2217 ).\nAlthough in principle it seems natural for \u039b to be significantly larger than t\u22122\nU (i.e. t\u039b \u226a tU ), first Barrow\nand Tipler [23], and then Weinberg [24] and Efstathiou\n[25], showed that 'observers' similar to ourselves could\n\n\f3\nnot exist if this were the case. Our existence requires\nthat small inhomogeneities in the early universe are able\nto grow by gravitational instability so as to form galaxies\nand stars. If \u039b is too large this cannot occur: gravitational instabilities turn off once the universe starts accelerating. The requirement that galaxies and stars exist\nplaces an anthropic upper-bound on observable values of\n\u039b equivalent to t\u039b & 0.7 Gyrs [23]. If there is only one\nuniverse, with one value of \u039b, the anthropic constraint\non \u039b brings us no closer to understanding why \u039b is so\nsmall (although if some 'constants vary cosmologically\nthere is the possibility that a small non-zero \u039b might be\nanthropically necessary in order to switch off variations\nin constants before they stop atoms from existing, see ref\n[26]). However, if there are many possible universes (or\na 'multiverse') each with different values of \u039b, then our\nuniverse could only ever be in the (possibly small) subset\nof universes where t\u039b & 0.7 Gyrs.\nIf we knew the prior probability distribution, fprior (\u039b),\nof values of \u039b in such a multiverse, one could then calculate the conditional probability of finding t\u039b \u223c tU given\nthe requirement that observers such as ourselves exist.\nWeinberg [24] noted that if fprior (\u039b) \u2248 const for t\u039b &\n0.7 Gyrs, we would typically expect t\u039b \u223c few \u00d7 0.7 Gyrs.\nThe observed value of t\u039b \u223c 9.3 Gyrs would then look\nfairly reasonable, and one could argue that the cosmological constant and coincidence problems had been solved.\nThis fprior (\u039b) corresponds to an approximately uniform\ndistribution of \u039b values smaller than the anthropic upperbound. Such an f (\u039b) is not, however, the only reasonable possibility for the prior distribution. If, for instance\n\u039b = Mpl e\u03c6 , and values of \u03c6 were uniformly distributed in\nthe multiverse, one would naturally expect \u039b to be much\nsmaller than the anthropic upper-bound i.e. t\u039b \u226b tU\n(and fprior (\u039b) \u221d \u039b\u22121 ). Before we had observations consistent with a non-zero value of \u039b, Coleman [27, 28] and\nHawking [29], and later Ng and van Dam [31], used euclidean approaches to quantum gravity to argue that the\ndistribution of \u039b values should be strongly peaked about\n\u039b = 0 (i.e. fprior (\u039b) = exp(3\u03c0/G\u039b)) with a form that is\ninterestingly characteristic of a Fisher-Tippett extremevalue distribution [30]. Again, this would make t\u039b \u223c tU\nseem highly unnatural.\nUltimately, we would like to calculate fprior (\u039b) from\nsome fundamental theory. Currently, the notion of a multiverse with different values of \u039b seems to have a natural\nrealization in the some 10500 different vacua of string theory (see e.g. Ref. [32]). A derivation of fprior (\u039b) in this\nlandscape of string vacua for those vacua compatible with\nlife still represents a major theoretical challenge. Common criticisms of anthropic selection in a multiverse as a\nexplanation of the CC problems are that it is not clear\nthat observers similar to ourselves are the only potential\nobservers we should consider when restricting possible\nvalues of \u039b; or that this explanation, as it is currently understood, makes no sharp predictions that can be tested\nby observations.\nIdeally, we would like to find explanations of the cos-\n\nmological constant and coincidence problems that are\nnatural, in the sense of requiring little or no fine tuning, and are, at least in principle, falsifiable by future\nobservations. In this paper we propose such a solution.\nFormally, we propose a paradigm which can be applied to\na variety of models, including extensions of general relativity and extra dimensions, and sometimes in a number of different ways. This paradigm establishes a new\nfield equation for the bare cosmological constant \u03bb which\ndetermines its value in terms of other properties of the\nobserved universe. Crucially, one finds the effective cosmological constant, \u039b, which is a sum of the bare cosmological constant and quantum fluctuations, to be of\nthe observed order of magnitude \u039b \u223c O(t\u22122\nU ). When our\nproposal is applied to general relativity, \u039b is not seen\nto evolve (i.e. it is constant throughout the universe).\nHence, the resulting cosmology is indistinguishable from\ngeneral relativity with the value of \u039b put in by hand.\nHowever, any given application of our theory produces a\nfirm prediction for \u039b in terms of other measurable quantities. If the actual value of \u039b deviates from this predicted\nvalue then that particular application of the paradigm\nis ruled out. It should be stressed that our paradigm is\nequally applicable to models where general relativity is\nmodified in some way, or where there are more than four\ndimensions. In such theories, the order of magnitude of\nthe predicted effective cosmological constant is generally\nthe same as it is in 3+1 general relativity.\nThe rest of this paper is laid out as follows: We specify\nand describe our new scheme to solve the cosmological\nconstant problems in \u00a7II. In \u00a7III, we apply it to a realistic\nmodel of our universe. We find that the predicted value\nof \u039b depends in detail on the spatial curvature and energy\ndensity of baryonic matter. Given the measured value of\n\u039b, this results in a prediction for the spatial curvature\nof the observable universe if our scenario is the correct\nexplanation for the observed value of \u039b.\nIn inflationary scenarios, different regions of the universe undergo different amounts of inflation (measured\nby the number of e-folds, N ). The observed spatial curvature scales as exp(\u22122N ) following inflation, and so the\nspatial curvature would be different in each bubble universe according to the amount of inflation it experiences.\nOur model therefore provides a link between the probability of living in a bubble universe where a given value of\nthe cosmological constant is observed and the duration\nof inflation in that bubble. In \u00a7III C we calculate the\nprobability of living in a bubble universe where t\u039b coincides with tU and find that, in our model it is indeed a\ntypical occurrence. Our conclusions, together with a list\nof answers to some possible questions about our scheme\nand its application to cosmology, are found in \u00a7IV. Some\ndetailed background calculations are presented in the appendices. We have provided a condensed presentation of\nour proposal in Ref. [50]. We work throughout with a\nmetric signature (\u2212 + ++) and units where c = ~ = 1;\nwe denote \u03ba = 8\u03c0G.\n\n\f4\nII.\n\nA PROPOSAL FOR SOLVING THE CC\nPROBLEMS\n\nIn this section we propose a new approach to solve\nthe cosmological constant (CC) problems without fine\ntuning.\nPreliminaries: We begin with some preliminary definitions. We will take the total action of the universe\ndefined on a manifold M, and with effective cosmological constant \u039b, to be Itot [g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a8a , \u039b; M], where \u03a8a are\nthe matter fields and g\u03bc\u03bd is the metric field. We define\n\u2202M = \u2202MI \u222a \u2202Mu where \u2202MI denotes some initial\nhypersurface, and \u2202Mu denotes the rest of \u2202M.\nAs usual, provided certain quantities are held fixed on\n\u2202M, the classical field equations result from the requirement that Itot [g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a8a , \u039b; M] be stationary with respect\nto small variations in g\u03bc\u03bd and \u03a8a . We represent the\nclassical field equations for g\u03bc\u03bd and \u03a8a by E \u03bc\u03bd = 0\nand \u03a6a = 0, respectively. The quantities that must\nbe held fixed on \u2202M depend on the surface terms in\nItot . For instance, it is well known that we can introduce\nthe Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) surface term on \u2202M\n[35, 36] into Itot so that the only quantities that need\nto be fixed on the boundary are the fields \u03a8a and the\ninduced 3-metric, \u03b3\u03bc\u03bd , on \u2202M.\nIn general, the quantities that must be held fixed cannot be freely specified on \u2202M. The classical fields generally imply consistency conditions that must be satisfied\nby these quantities. This is particularly the case if some\nparts of \u2202M are causally connected to other parts. For\ninstance, if \u2202MI represents a Cauchy surface for \u2202Mu ,\nthen the \u03b3\u03bc\u03bd and \u03a8a on \u2202Mu will be at least partially determined by the specification of the initial data on \u2202MI\n\u03bc\u03bd\nand by the field\n\b Aequations E = 0 and \u03a6a = 0.\nWe define Q\nto be a minimal set of quantities that\nneed be freely specified on \u2202M and held fixed, such that\nItot is a stationary point with respect to variations in g\u03bc\u03bd\nand \u03a8a . For definiteness, we consider the total action\nwith GHY surface term and focus on the variation of the\nmetric. For an unconstrained metric variation we have:\nZ\np\n1\n\u03b4Itot =\n|\u03b3| d3 x N \u03bc\u03bd \u03b4\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd\n2\u03ba \u2202M\nZ\n\u221a\n1\n+\n\u2212g d4 x E \u03bc\u03bd \u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd ,\n2\u03ba M\n\b\nfor some tensor N \u03bc\u03bd . We hold some QA fixed and\n(0)\ndecompose the variations in g\u03bc\u03bd into g\u03bc\u03bd = g\u03bc\u03bd +\n(M)\n(\u2202M)\n(M)\n(\u2202M)\n\u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd + \u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd . We define \u03b4\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd and \u03b4\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd\nrespec(M)\n(\u2202M)\ntively to be the projections of \u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd and \u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd\nonto\n\u2202M. The decomposition of the metric variation is per(M)\n(\u2202M)\nformed so that \u03b4\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd = 0 and a priori \u03b4\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd\n6= 0.\n(0)\n(\u2202M)\nWe write \u1e21\u03bc\u03bd = g\u03bc\u03bd + \u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd . Minimizing the action\n(M)\nwith respect to fluctuations \u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd that vanish when pro\u03bc\u03bd\njected onto \u2202M requires: \bE [\u1e21\u03bc\u03bd ] = 0. This equation,\ncombined with the fixed QA , constrains the form of\n\b\n(\u2202M)\n\u03b4\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd . We require that fixing the set QA and impos-\n\ning E \u03bc\u03bd [\u1e21\u03bc\u03bd ] = 0 are sufficient to determine that, with\n(\u2202M) \u223c\nfixed \u039b, N \u03bc\u03bd \u03b4\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd = N \u03bc\u03bd \u03b4\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd\n= 0, where \u223c\n= 0 here\nindicates that N \u03bc\u03bd \u03b4\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd is a total derivative and hence\n\u03b4Itot = 0 when E \u03bc\u03bd \b\n= 0. Usually this implies that\nE \u03bc\u03bd = 0 and the fixed QA completely fix the induced\nmetric (\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd ) up to diffeomorphisms of \u2202M. This is just\na restatement of the usual variational principle.\nThe gravitational field equations, E \u03bc\u03bd = 0, depend on\nthe (effective) cosmological constant \b\u039b. It follows that\nthe metric \u03b3\u03bc\u03bd on \u2202M determined by QA and E \u03bc\u03bd = 0\ndepends on \u039b. Usually, \u039b is treated as a fixed parameter,\neither put in by hand or picked from a distribution\n\b of\ndifferent values in a multiverse. With \u039b fixed, the QA\nand the equations E \u03bc\u03bd = 0 then fix \u03b3\u03bc\u03bd , and hence imply\n\u03b4\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd = 0. However, if \u039b is varied by some small amount\n\u03b4\u039b, one would have:\n\u03b4\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd = H\u03bc\u03bd \u03b4\u039b,\nwhere\nH\u03bc\u03bd =\n\n\u03b4\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03b4\u039b\n\n.\nE \u03bc\u03bd =\u03a6a =0;{QA }\n\nSimilarly, for the matter fields, we can define P a by:\nPa =\n\n\u03b4\u03a8a\n\u03b4\u039b\n\n.\nE \u03bc\u03bd =\u03a6a =0;{QA }\n\nA New Proposal: Given the definitions above, our\nproposal for solving the CC problems is as follows:\n\u2022 We promote the bare cosmological constant, \u03bb,\nfrom a fixed parameter to a field (albeit one that\nis constant in space and time). Quantum mechanically, the partition function of the universe (see\n\u00a7II A below) includes a sum over all possible values\nof \u03bb in addition to the usual sum over configurations of g\u03bc\u03bd and \u03a8a . The effective cosmological\nconstant, \u039b, is equal to \u03bb + const and so a sum\nover all possible values of \u03bb is equivalent to a sum\nover all \u039b. This sum over \u039b is defined up to an\nunknown weighting function, \u03bc[\u039b], which is similar\nto the prior weighting of different \u039b in multiverse\nmodels.\na\n\u2022 We sum over\n\b configurations of g\u03bc\u03bd and \u03a8 keeping\nsome data QA fixed on the boundary, \u2202M, of the\nmanifold M on which the action, Itot , is defined.\n\n\u2022 The classical field equations are found by requiring\nthat \u03b4Itot = 0 \b\nwith respect to variations in the fields\nthat preserve QA . For variations of g\u03bc\u03bd and \u03a8a ,\nthis gives respectively E \u03bc\u03bd = 0 and \u03a6a = 0. The\nclassical value of the effective cosmological constant\nis now determined by the requirement that Itot be\nstationary with respect to variations in \u039b i.e.\n\u03b4Itot\n\u03b4\u039b\n\n= 0.\n{QA }\n\n\f5\nCrucially, this new field equation for \u039b includes\ncontributions from the variation of the boundary\na\nvalues\n\b A of g\u03bc\u03bd and \u03a8 with respect to \u039b (with fixed\nQ ). This provides a non-trivial equation for\nthe classical value of the effective cosmological constant in M. Note that this classical field equation\nfor \u039b is independent of the prior weighting \u03bc[\u039b].\n\u2022 The classical value of the effective CC, \u039b, that is determined in this way does not depend on the quantum vacuum energy. It is instead\ndetermined by\n\b\nM, and the fixed quantities QA (which could be\ntaken as the initial conditions). Because \u039b is no\nlonger determined by \u03c1vac , the quantum cosmological constant problem is evaded in our proposal.\n\u2022 Finally, we construct a concrete application by demanding that, for a given observer, the sum of different configurations of the partition function depends only on the potential configurations in the\nobserver's causal past. This implies that M is the\ncausal past of the observer. Given this choice, or\nsimilar choices, for M, an order of magnitude estimate for the classical value of \u039b seen by an observer\nat a time when the age of the universe is tU is always \u039b \u223c O(t\u22122\nU ) and a solution of the coincidence\nproblem is ensured.\nWe define Iclass (\u039b; M) to be the value of\nItot [g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a8a , \u039b; M] evaluated with g\u03bc\u03bd and \u03a8a obeying\ntheir classical field\n\b equations for fixed boundary /\ninitial conditions, QA . We show below that the field\nequation for the effective CC, \u039b, is then given succinctly\nby\ndIclass (\u039b; M)\n= 0.\nd\u039b\n\ng\u03bc\u03bd ,\u03a8a\nfixed {QA }\n\n\u00d7 [gauge fixing terms] .\n\nIn the classical limit Z\u039b [M] is dominated by configurations\ng\u03bc\u03bd and \u03a8a that are compatible with the fixed\n\b A\nQ\nfor which Itot is stationary. We assume there are\nN such classical solutions (not related by gauge transformations) and for the \u03b1th solutions : Itot [g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a8a , \u039b; M] =\n(\u03b1)\nIclass [\u039b; M]. In this limit, we have\nZ\u039b [M] \u2248\n\nN\nX\n\n(\u03b1)\n\neiIclass [\u039b;M] .\n\n\u03b1=1\n\nWe demand that\b the quantities that must be held fixed\non \u2202M, i.e. the QA , are independent and can be freely\nspecified. Hence, when they are held fixed, the stationary\npoints of Itot correspond to configurations obeying the\nusual classical field equations, E \u03bc\u03bd = \u03a6a = 0.\nWe propose to promote \u03bb from a fixed parameter to a\n'field' whose different configurations are summed over in\nthe partition function. The introduction of a sum over \u03bb\nis only defined up to some arbitrary weighting function\n\u03bc\u03bb \u2261 \u03bc[\u039b]. The total partition function for the scenario\nwe have proposed is then simply given by:\nX\nZ[M] =\n\u03bc[\u039b]Z\u039b [M]\n\u039b\n\n(1)\n\nIn this rest of this section we present a more detailed\nstatement of our proposal for solving the CC problem,\ngive the general form of the new field equation for \u039b, and\nshow that the classical value of the CC determined by\nthis equation is typically expected to be of the observed\norder of magnitude.\nA.\n\nrather, it is a fixed parameter which determines Itot .\nWith fixed \u03bb the partition function is Z[\u03bb; M] \u2261 Z\u039b [M]\nwhere \u039b = \u03bb + const and:\nX\na\neiItot [g\u03bc\u03bd ,\u03a8 ,\u039b;M]\nZ\u039b [M] =\n\nPartition Function of the Universe\n\nA relatively simple and revealing statement of our proposed paradigm for determining the effective CC can be\ngiven in terms of the partition function (or quantum\nstate), Z, of the universe. Z is given by a sum over\nall possible configurations of fields, consistent with\n\b certain fixed quantities on the boundary (i.e. the QA )\nand weighted by exp(iItot ), where Itot is the total action.\nThe action is defined on a manifold M with boundary\n\u2202M. The fields are the metric, g\u03bc\u03bd , and supporting matter fields, \u03a8a .\nIn the usual approach the bare CC, \u03bb, is not a field, in\nthe sense that its different configurations are summed;\n\n=\n\nX\n\n\u03bc[\u039b]eiItot [g\u03bc\u03bd ,\u03a8\n\na\n\n,\u039b;M]\n\n\u039b,g\u03bc\u03bd ,\u03a8a\nfixed {QA }\n\n\u00d7 [gauge fixing terms] .\n\nIn principle, the weighting \u03bc[\u039b] should be determined by\na fundamental theory or some symmetry principle. Crucially, we shall see that our results are independent of this\n\u03bc[\u039b] and so we do not need to concern ourselves with its\nprecise form. This is in contrast to multiverse scenarios,\nwhere the extent to which the observed value of the CC\nis natural depends significantly on the prior weighting of\ndifferent values of \u039b in the multiverse. Here, whilst g\u03bc\u03bd\nand \u03a8a are space-time fields on M, \u039b is a space-time constant. In the different histories that are summed over, \u039b\ntakes different values, but in each history it takes only one\nvalue throughout M. We could promote \u039b to a spacetime scalar field, \u039b(x\u03bc ), provided we introduced a delta\nfunction that requires \u2207\u03bc \u039b = 0 - see appendix A for\nfurther discussion of this; taking this approach does not\nalter our results. Alternatively, the variable \u03bb required\nin our model could be associated with the squared fourform field strength F24 , where F4 = d \u2227 A3 is a 4-form\nfield strength and A3 is a 3-form gauge field. Such a term\n\n\f6\narises naturally in N = 8 supergravity in 4-dimensions\n(see Ref. [34] for further details). With the inclusion\nof an appropriate boundary term, the sum over different\nconfigurations of A3 reduces to the sum over a contribution, \u03bb, to the cosmological constant with is constant\nover M in each history.\nTaking the classical limit for g\u03bc\u03bd and \u03a8a , Z[M] then\nreduces the partition function to:\nZ[M] \u2248\n\nN X\nX\n\n\u03bc[\u039b]e\n\n(\u03b1)\n\niIclass [\u039b;M]\n\n.\n\n\u03b1=1 \u039b\n\nThe sum over \u039b in the above expression is then dom(\u03b1)\ninated by the value(s) of \u039b for which dIclass / d\u039b = 0.\nThis provides the classical field equation for \u039b. In order\nof the universe to appear classical to an observer, there\nshould be a unique classical solution (once the gauge freedoms are fixed) for g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a8a (i.e. N = 1) and for \u039b. If\nthere were more than one solution for \u039b, some number\nN\u039b say, the observer would see a superposition of N\u039b\nclassical histories each with different values of \u039b. If there\nwere no classical solutions for \u039b, the universe would be\nobserved to behave in a fundamentally quantum manner.\nProvided a unique classical solution exists for \u039b, the partition function is dominated by a single history in which\nthe CC is \u039b, as given by Eq. (1), and Itot = Iclass [\u039b; M].\nIn the classical limit we have:\nZ[M] \u2248 \u03bc[\u039b]eiIclass [\u039b;M] .\n\nThe expectation of an observable O(g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a6a , \u039b) is given\nby:\nX\na\n1\nhOi =\nO(g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a6a , \u039b)\u03bc[\u039b]eiItot [g\u03bc\u03bd ,\u03a8 ,\u039b;M]\nZ[M]\na\n\u039b,g\u03bc\u03bd ,\u03a8\nfixed {QA }\n\n\u00d7 [gauge fixing terms] .\nWhen Eq. (1) has a solution for the CC, and a classical\nlimit exists, we then have:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03bc[\u039b]eiIclass [\u039b;M]\nhOi \u2248 O(g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a6a , \u039b)\n= O(g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a6a , \u039b),\nZ[M]\nwhich is independent of the prior weighting \u03bc[\u039b].\nB.\n\nField Equation for \u039b\n\nWe have proposed a paradigm for dynamically determining the value of the effective cosmological \u039b. In our\nproposal, we have found that the value of \u039b is given by\nan additional field equation Eq. (1). In order to estimate\nthe order of magnitude of \u039b determined by Eq. (1) it is\nhelpful to rewrite it in an expanded form.\nThe total action, Itot , is composed of the gravitational\naction, Igrav , the bare matter action, Im , and the bare\ncosmological constant action ICC [\u03bb, g\u03bc\u03bd ; M], where\nZ\n\u221a\n1\nICC [\u03bb, g\u03bc\u03bd ; M] = \u2212\n\u2212g d4 x \u03bb.\n\u03ba M\n\nIn this context Im is 'bare' in the sense that it includes\nthe contribution from the matter sector to the vacuum\nenergy i.e. Im = Imatter + Ivac , where Imatter vanishes in\na vacuum and Ivac = ICC [\u03ba\u03c1vac , g\u03bc\u03bd ; M] gives the contribution from the vacuum energy. Henceforth we refer to\nImatter as the matter action and note that it makes no\ncontribution to the vacuum energy. With the effective\nCC, \u039b, given by \u039b = \u03bb + \u03ba\u03c1vac we have\nItot [g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a8a , \u039b; M] = Igrav [g\u03bc\u03bd ; M] + ICC [\u039b, g\u03bc\u03bd ; M]\n+Imatter [\u03a8a , g\u03bc\u03bd ; M].\nAt this stage, for illustrative purposes, we assume that\nthe boundary terms in Igrav and Imatter have been chosen\nso that the action is first order in the derivatives of g\u03bc\u03bd\nand \u03a8a . With this choice, small perturbations in the\nfields g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a8a , and in the bare cosmological constant \u03bb,\ngive Itot \u2192 Itot + \u03b4Itot , where schematically,\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\np\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\n|\u03b3| d3 x\n\u03b4Itot =\nN \u03b4\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd + \u03a3a \u03b4\u03a8a (2)\n2\u03ba\n\u2202M\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n\u221a\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\nE \u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd + \u03a6a \u03b4\u03a8a\n+\n\u2212g d4 x\n2\u03ba\nM\nZ\n\u221a\n\u03b4\u03bb\n\u2212\n\u2212g d4 x,\n\u03ba M\n\nfor some N \u03bc\u03bd , \u03a3a , E \u03bc\u03bd and \u03a6a . Minimizing this action\nwith respect to variations of g\u03bc\u03bd and \u03a8a in the 'bulk',\nM, with fixed boundary values requires E \u03bc\u03bd = \u03a6a = 0.\nWe showed above that these\n\b equations combined with\nthe requirement that some QA (which can be freely\nspecified) are fixed on the boundary, \u2202M, restrict the\nvariations of \u03b4\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd and \u03b4\u03a8a (up to gauge transformations)\non \u2202M to be of the form:\n\u03b4\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd |\u2202M = H\u03bc\u03bd \u03b4\u03bb,\n\n\u03a8a |\u2202M = P a \u03b4\u03bb.\n\nThus, with E \u03bc\u03bd = \u03a6a = 0, for \u03b4Itot = 0 one needs\n\u03b4Itot /\u03b4\u03bb = 0, which is equivalent to dIclass / d\u03bb = 0, and\nwhich, from the above, can be written as\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\nZ\np\n\u221a\n1\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\na\nN H\u03bc\u03bd + \u03a3a P =\n|\u03b3|\n\u2212g d4 x.\n2\u03ba\n\u03ba M\n\u2202M\n(3)\n\u03bc\u03bd\nThe forms of H\u03bc\u03bd and P a are determined\nby\nE\n=\n0,\n\b\n\u03a6a = 0, and the requirement that QA are fixed. Eq.\n(3) is equivalent to Eq. (1) in the case where the boundary terms in Itot are chosen so that the action is first\norder in derivatives g\u03bc\u03bd and \u03a8a . Although Eq.(1) represents a more succinct statement of the field equation for\n\u039b, the expanded form given by Eq. (3) is more useful\nin estimating the order of magnitude of the value of \u039b\ndetermined by its field equation.\nC.\n\nThe Natural Order of Magnitude of the\nEffective Cosmological Constant\n\nIn this subsection, we estimate the order of magnitude\nof the classical effective CC that arises from solutions of\nthe \u039b-field equation i.e. Eq. (1) or equivalently Eq. (3).\n\n\f7\nWe focus on a cosmological setting where M is taken\nto be the causal past and \u2202Mu is the past light cone.\nThe boundary is \u2202M = \u2202Mu \u222a \u2202MI where \u2202MI is the\ninitial hypersurface. We assume that the fixed quantities,\n\b\nQA , are such as to fix the initial state on \u2202MI ; H\u03bc\u03bd\nand Pa vanish (up to diffeomorphisms) on \u2202MI . Eq. (3)\nthen reads:\n\u0015 Z\n\u0014\nZ\np\n\u221a\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\na\n|\u03b3| N H\u03bc\u03bd + \u03ba\u03a3a P =\n\u2212g d4 x. (4)\n2\nM\n\u2202Mu\nNow we estimate\n\nN \u03bc\u03bd H\u03bc\u03bd = N \u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u03b4\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd\n\u223c O(tr N/\u039b),\n\u03b4\u039b\n\nwhere tr N = N \u03bc\u03bd \u03b3\u03bc\u03bd . In many theories of gravity, including general relativity, tr N \u223c O(tr K), where K\u03bc\u03bd is\nthe extrinsic curvature of the boundary, \u2202Mu . Cosmologically, tr K \u223c O(H) where H is the Hubble parameter;\nH0 is its value today. Thus, we have\nZ\nZ\np\np\n1\nd3 x |\u03b3|N \u03bc\u03bd H\u03bc\u03bd \u223c\n|\u03b3| d3 x \u039b\u22121 H\n2 \u2202M\n\u2202M\nH0\nA\u2202M ,\n\u223c\n\u039b\nwhere A\u2202M is the surface area of \u2202M. Similarly, the\ncontribution from the \u03ba\u03a3a P a matter terms in Eq. (4)\nis generally of the same order as that from N \u03bc\u03bd H\u03bc\u03bd .\nThe left-hand side of Eq. (4) is therefore generally\n\u223c O(H0 A\u2202M /\u039b). The right-hand side of Eq. (3) is\nsimply the 4-volume, VM , of M. We note that typically VM \u223c tU A\u2202M where tU is the age of the universe.\nPutting these estimates together in Eq. (3) we have\nH0\nH0 A\u2202M\nH0\n\u223c\n.\nA\u2202M \u223c VM \u21d2 \u039b \u223c\n\u039b\nVM\ntU\nUsing tU \u223c H0\u22121 , we find the general order of magnitude\nestimate is \u039b \u223c t\u22122\nU . We note that the presence of D\nsmall (or even large) extra dimensions with volume Vextra\nwould not change this order of magnitude estimate. The\nextra dimensions would result in A\u2202M \u2192 A\u2202M Vextra ,\nVM \u2192 VM Vextra , but the prediction \u039b \u223c H0 A\u2202M /VM \u2192\nH0 A\u2202M /VM \u223c 1/t2U remains unchanged.\nThus, provided the field equation for \u039b, Eq. (1), admits a unique classical solution, we naturally expect the\nmagnitude of the classical value of the effective CC, \u039b,\nto be O(1/t2U ). Thus our proposal results in a \u039b whose\nexpected magnitude is naturally of the order of the observed value. Provided a specific application of our proposal realizes a unique prediction for \u039b of this magnitude (\u223c 1/t2U ), it will have simultaneously solved both\nthe cosmological constant and the coincidence problems\n(see \u00a7III) for an example of such an application).\nOur proposal results in a situation where those classical\nhistories that dominate the partition function naturally\nhave a value of the bare cosmological constant \u03bb that all\nbut exactly cancels the vacuum energy of \u03ba\u03c1vac in M.\n\nThe effective CC, \u039b = \u03bb + \u03ba\u03c1vac , is then determined by\nthe properties of M. This is achieved without introducing ad hoc small parameters or special fine-tunings. In\nthis sense, the solution to the CC problem provided by\nscheme could be considered natural.\n\nIII.\n\nAPPLICATION TO COSMOLOGY\n\nIn this section we consider the application of our proposal for solving the CC problem to cosmological models.\nThe scheme we laid out in the previous section is flexible\nin that it does not make any specific assumptions about\neither the theory of gravity or the dimensionality of the\nuniverse. There is also a freedom in how one chooses to\ndefine the manifold M on which the total action, Itot , is\ndefined.\nIn this section, for simplicity, we assume that gravitational sector is described by unmodified general relativity, space-time has 3+1 dimensions, and that M is the\ncausal past of the observer. We take the observer to be\nat a fixed point, p0 . The manifold M is bounded by\nthe past-light cone \u2202Mu of p0 and an initial time-like\nhypersurface \u2202MI with given normal t\u03bc0 . Our proposal\nrequires that M remains fixed for different values of the\nbare cosmological constant, \u03bb; that is, there exists a coordinate chart C = {x\u03bc } such that, for all \u03bb, the values of\nthe {x\u03bc } at p0 , and on the boundaries \u2202Mu and \u2202MI ,\nare the same for all \u03bb.\nWhile there is considerable freedom in the definition\nof the chart C, a natural and simple choice results from\nthe demand that changes in \u03bb preserve the light cone,\nand hence the causal, structure of space-time. Given this\nchoice, we define some null coordinates u and w such that\nu = \u03c40 , for some \u03bb-independent \u03c40 , on \u2202Mu , and u < \u03c40\nin w. We then define w so that w = \u2212u on \u2202MI and\nw = \u03c40 at p0 . We define u\u03bc = \u2207\u03bc u and w\u03bc = \u2207\u03bc w. Now,\nw\u03bc w\u03bc = u\u03bc u\u03bc = 0, and we define \u03c3 by 2e\u22122\u03c3 = \u2212u\u03bc w\u03bc .\nThe metric can then be decomposed as\ng\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212e2\u03c3 u(\u03bc w\u03bd) + h\u03bc\u03bd .\nHere, h\u03bc\u03bd = E\u03bci E\u03bdj hij where i = 1, 2 for some positivedefinite 2-metric, hij , and some E\u03bci for which w\u03bc E\u03bci =\nu\u03bc E i = 0. We define some intrinsic coordinates \u03b8i =\n\b 1 \u03bc2\n\u03b8 , \u03b8 on the closed 2-surfaces S(u,w) of constant u and\nw. The 2-metric hij is then defined by taking h\u03bc \u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u03b8i =\nE\u03bci ; hij = h\u03bc\u03bd E\u03bci E\u03bdj . We can then write:\nE\u03bci = \u2202\u03bc \u03b8i + ri u\u03bc + si w\u03bc ,\ni\ni\nfor some\n\b r and1 s 2. Our coordinate chart is then given\nby C = u, w, \u03b8 , \u03b8 , and in M is determined by u < \u03c40 ,\n\u2212u < w < \u03c40 . In this chart:\n\nds2 = g\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd = \u2212e2\u03c3 du dw + hij D\u03b8i D\u03b8j , (5)\n\nD\u03b8i = d\u03b8i + ri du + si dw.\n\n\f8\nWe define a time-like coordinate \u03c4 = (u + w)/2. The\ninitial hypersurface therefore corresponds to \u03c4 = 0 and\nthe observer's position is \u03c4 = \u03c40 . The normal to \u2202MI\nis taken to be given, and this therefore partially restricts\nthe freedom in the definition of u and w. We also define a\nspace-like radial coordinate r = (u \u2212 w)/2; we then have\nr = 0 at p0 . FIG. 1 shows an illustration of M and its\nboundary.\nThe intrinsic three-metric on the initial hypersurface\nhas line-element\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(I)\nds2\u03c4 =0 = e2\u03c3(I) dr2 + h\u0304ij D(I) \u03b8i D(I) \u03b8j ,\ni\ndr,\nD(I) \u03b8i = d\u03b8i + K(I)\n(I)\n\ni\n=\nwhere \u03c3(I) = \u03c3|\u03c4 =0 , h\u0304ij = e\u22122\u03c3 hij \u03c4 =0 and K(I)\ni\ni\nr \u2212 s \u03c4 =0 . The requirement that the initial state be\n(I)\n\nfixed independently of \u03bb on \u2202MI implies that \u03c3I , h\u0304ij\nand KIi are fixed up to \u03bb independent diffeomorphisms\non \u2202MI .\nThe surfaces S(u,w) of constant u and w (or equivalently constant \u03c4 and r) represent the intersection of a\npast and a future-directed light cone. As such, the S(u,w)\nare closed two-surfaces. We define R\u0304 to be the scalar curvature of the conformal 2-metric h\u0304ij . Since h\u0304ij describes\na two-dimensional space, it is completely characterized\nby R\u0304. Additionally, by the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we\nknow that\nZ\np\nhR\u0304i(u,w) A2 (u, w) \u2261\nR\u0304 h\u0304 d2 \u03b8\nu,w=const\nZ\np\n= 2\nh\u0304 d2 \u03b8 \u2261 2A2 (u, w).\nu,w=const\n\nwhere A2 (u, w) is the surface area of the conformal 2space described by h\u0304ij , and hR\u0304i(u,w) is the average curvature. The conformal 2-surfaces are homotopic to a 2sphere. If the intrinsic metric on the 2-spheres were that\nof a two-sphere with conformal radius \u03c1, then we would\nhave A2 (u, w) = 4\u03c0\u03c12 and hR\u0304i(u,w) = 2/\u03c12 . This singles\nout a preferred class of definitions for u and w on the initial hypersurface on which \u03c4 = (u+w)/2 = 0. We can always pick r = (u\u2212w)/2 so that on \u2202MI (where u = \u2212w),\nA2 (\u2212w, w) = 4\u03c0r2 or equivalently hR\u0304i(\u2212w,w) = 2/r2 .\nWe note that for a 2-metric, with constant r, the diffeo(I)\nmorphism invariant structure of h\u0304ij is completely determined by its scalar curvature R\u0304(I) . Since (u, w) = const\nrepresents the intersection of two light cones, the surfaces of constant u and w are closed, and so R\u0304(I) > 0.\nWe note that we can always choose u and w so that on\n\u2202MI , R\u0304(I) = 2/r2 with r = u = \u2212w on \u2202MI .\nChoice of Surface Terms: Another freedom in our\nscheme is the choice of surface terms in Itot . Focussing\non the variation of the metric, and keeping all other\nfields including the CC fixed, these surface terms determine the quantities that must be held on \u2202M, so that\n\u03b4Itot /\u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd = 0 when the classical field equations hold.\nThe metric on and around a space-like and time-like\n\nboundary is described by the induced metric \u03b3\u03bc\u03bd and the\nextrinsic curvature, K \u03bc\u03bd . On a null boundary the situation is slightly more complicated and we discuss it further\nbelow; nonetheless, there are quantities analogous to \u03b3\u03bc\u03bd\nand K \u03bc\u03bd . The \u03b3\u03bc\u03bd and K \u03bc\u03bd are respectively analogous\nto position variables and their associated momenta. In\nmost cases it is natural to choose the surface terms so\nthat (for fixed CC), the 'position variable' \u03b3\u03bc\u03bd must be\nheld fixed. The required surface term was first identified by York [35], and then rediscovered and refined by\nGibbons and Hawking [36]. We refer to ii as the GibbonsHawking-York (GHY) boundary term. However, if K \u03bc\u03bd ,\n(or some components of it), diverge faster than \u03b3\u03bc\u03bd as one\napproaches the boundary, different choices of boundary\nterm may be required.\nMetric quantities are suitably well-behaved on the null\nboundary \u2202Mu and so for this boundary it is natural to\npick the null boundary analogue of the GHY term.\nIn the cosmological setting, \u2202MI is the initial sin(0)\ngularity and the intrinsic metric, \u03b3\u03bc\u03bd , on \u2202MI has\n(\u03c4 )\nvanishing determinant. More formally, taking \u03b3\u03bc\u03bd ,\nto be the induced metric on surfaces of constant \u03c4 ,\n\u03bc\u03bd\nlim\u03c4 \u21920+ det\u03b3 (\u03c4 ) = 0. We define K(\u03c4\n) to be the extrinsic curvature on constant \u03c4 surfaces; K(\u03c4 ) = K \u03bc (\u03c4 )\u03bc .\nGenerally, K diverges as \u03c4 \u2192 0+ . The quantities det\u03b3\nand K are canonically conjugate. It is most natural to\nchoose boundary terms so that the most divergence of\ntwo canonically conjugate variables is held fixed (c.f. the\nargument for fixing the charge rather than the chemical potential in Ref. [39]). This implies that, on \u2202MI ,\nwe choose the surface term so that K rather than det\u03b3\nis fixed. In Appendix B, we note that this term is the\n'cosmological' boundary term found by York in Ref. [35].\nThus, we fix the surface terms in Itot to be York's cosmological boundary term on \u2202MI , and the GHY boundary\nterm on \u2202Mu . It should be stressed, though, this choice\nof York rather tha GHY boundary term on \u2202MI has no\naffect on the equation for \u03bb and is only made for the technical reason stated above. This is because the initial state\non \u2202MI is fixed independently of \u03bb in our proposal and\nso for any \u2202MI boundary term, I\u2202MI , \u03b4IdMI /\u03b4\u03bb = 0. It\nfollows that boundary terms on \u2202MI do not contribute\nto the \u03bb-equation: \u03b4Itot /\u03b4\u03bb = 0.\n\nA.\n\nGeneral Cosmology\n\nWe begin by writing down the form of Itot for the general cosmological setting and considering its variation.\nIn addition to Itot , our\n\b scheme requires that we specify a set of quantities QA that are kept fixed (for all\nvalues of the bare cosmological constant) and which can\nbe independently specified. By considering the variation\nof the action, we present a natural choice of these fixed\nquantities.\nSince we have taken the gravity sector to be described\n(to a suitable approximation) by unmodified general rel-\n\n\f9\n\nFIG. 1: (colour online) An illustration of the manifold M and its boundary \u2202M = \u2202Mu \u222a \u2202MI for the general cosmology\nset-up considered in \u00a7III. Here, M is the causal past of the observer, \u2202Mu is the null boundary given by the observer's past\nlight cone and \u2202MI is a space-like boundary which represents the initial hypersurface. The model remains well-defined in the\nlimit where \u2202MI is the initial singularity. We pick orthogonal null coordinates u and w such that \u2202Mu corresponds to u = \u03c40 ,\nand on \u2202Mu , \u2212\u03c40 < w < \u03c40 for some fixed \u03c40 , and the time coordinate given by \u03c4 = (u + w)/2 vanishes on \u2202MI . We also\ndefine a radial coordinate r = (u \u2212 w)/2 and choose w = \u03c40 at the observer's position, so that there \u03c4 = \u03c40 and r = 0. In the\nfigure, constant u surfaces are shown as dotted red line (except \u2202Mu which is a solid red line), and correspond to past-light\ncones of points on the line r = 0 (the dashed black line) which connects the observer with \u2202MI . The w = const surfaces are\nfuture-directed light cones of points on r = 0 and are shown above as dot-dashed blue lines. Surfaces of constant u and w are\nclosed 2-surfaces S(u,w) with intrinsic coordinates \u03b8i ; i = 1, 2.\n\nativity, the gravitational action, Igrav , is given by\nIgrav [g\u03bc\u03bd ; M] = IEH [g\u03bc\u03bd ; M] + Isurf [g\u03bc\u03bd ; \u2202M],\nwhere Isurf are the surface terms defined on \u2202M and IEH\nis the Einstein-Hilbert action defined on M:\nZ\n\u221a\n1\nIEH [g\u03bc\u03bd ; M] =\nd4 x \u2212gR(g).\n2\u03ba M\nWe have taken the boundary to be \u2202M = \u2202M(u) \u222a \u2202MI ,\nwhere \u2202M(u) is described by the vanishing of the null\ncoordinate u, and so it represents a null boundary. Our\n\u2202MI is the initial space-like hypersurface given by \u03c4 = 0.\nAs one approaches \u03c4 = 0, the determinant of the induced\nmetric on \u03c4 = const hypersurfaces vanishes, whilst the\ntrace of the extrinsic curvature diverges. On \u2202M(u) it\nis natural to take the surface term to be the null boundary analogue of the Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) term,\n(u)\nIGHY say, whereas on \u2202MI the divergence of K makes\n\u03c4 \u2192 0 limit of York's cosmological (YC) surface more\n(I)\nnatural; we write this as IYC .\nIn appendix B we present a detailed rederivation and\ndiscussion of boundary terms in general relativity for\nboth non-null and null boundaries. Here, we briefly review those results where they apply to the form of the\n(I)\n(u)\nIGHY and IYC terms.\n\n1.\n\nGHY term on \u2202Mu (u = \u03c40 ):\n\nWe consider a null boundary \u2202M(u) described by some\nu(x\u03bc ) = \u03c40 where, with u\u03bc = \u2207\u03bc u, we have u\u03bc u\u03bc = 0.\nWe define n\u03bc = \u2212e\u03c3 u\u03bc for some \u03c3. In order to describe\npoints on \u2202M(u) , we have a w(x\u03bc ) such that w\u03bc = \u2207\u03bc w\nis null and w\u03bc u\u03bc = \u22122e\u22122\u03c3 > 0. We also define \u03c4 =\n(u + w)/2 and so, on \u2202Mu , \u03c4 = (\u03c40 + w)/2. Eq. (5) gives\nthe decomposition of the metric g\u03bc\u03bd in terms of u, w\nand the intrinsic coordinates \u03b8i on the closed 2-surfaces,\nS(u,w) , of constant u and w. The hij is the induced 2metric on the S(u,w) and h\u03bc\u03bd = g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 e2\u03c3 w(\u03bc u\u03bd) . We\ndefine n\u03bc = \u2212e\u03c3 u\u03bc , and n\u0304\u03bc = e\u03c3 w\u03bc so that n\u0304\u03bc n\u03bc = 2.\nThe extrinsic curvature of S(u,w) along n\u03bc is K\u03bc\u03bd and\nis defined by\n1\nK\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212 h\u03bc\u03c1 h\u03bd\u03c3 Ln h\u03c1\u03c3\n2\n= e\u03c3 h\u03bc\u03c1 h\u03bd\u03c3 \u2207\u03c1 u\u03c3 .\n\n(6)\n\nWriting ei\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc \u03b8i , we define Kij = ei\u03bc ej\u03bd K\u03bc\u03bd and the\ntrace of the extrinsic curvature is K = K\u03bc\u03bd h\u03bc\u03bd = Kij hij .\nWe also define the inaffinity, \u03bd, and twist, \u03c9 \u03bc , by\n\u03bd = \u2212Ln \u03c3 = e\u03c3 u\u03bc \u2207\u03bc \u03c3,\nWe also define \u03c9 i = \u03c9 \u03bc ei\u03bc .\n\n\u03c9\u03bc =\n\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\nh n\u0304\u03c1 \u2207\u03bd n\u03c1 .\n2\n\n\f10\nThe usual GHY term (defined on non-null boundaries)\nhas the property that it renders the action first order\nin derivatives of the metric. The variation of the total\naction with respect to the metric is then free of surface\nterms whenever the induced boundary 3-metric is held\nfixed. On a null boundary there is no (non-singular)\nboundary 3-metric. In its place are h\u03bc\u03bd and e\u03c3 . This\nis clear when one\n\u221a notes that the invariantparea element\non \u2202M(u) is e\u03c3 h d\u03c4 d2 \u03b8, as opposed to |\u03b3| d3 x on a\nnon-null boundary. Thus, the analogue of the GHY term\nfor a null boundary is defined by the property that when\ne\u03c3 and h\u03bc\u03bd are fixed, variation of the total action with\nrespect to the metric is free of surface terms on \u2202Mu .\nGiven this, we find in Appendix B that the GHY term\nfor \u2202M(u) is:\nZ\n\u221a\n1\n(u)\nIGHY =\ne\u03c3 h d\u03c4 d2 \u03b8 [K + \u03bd] .\n\u03ba \u2202Mu\nOne finds the same boundary term if one starts with the\nEH action in terms of a vierbein and adds a boundary\nterm so that action is first order in derivatives of the\nvierbein (see Appendix B for a proof of this).\nOn a space-like or time-like boundary, \u03a3 say, it is well\nknown that the GHY boundary term invariant under diffeomorphisms restricted to \u03a3 (i.e. those under which the\n4-vector normal to \u03a3 is invariant). However, on a null\n(u)\nboundary this is not the case. IGHY is invariant under\ndiffeomorphisms on the two surfaces of constant u and w\n(i.e. S(u,w) ), but it is not invariant under reparametrizations of the 'radial' coordinate (in this case w or equivalently \u03c4 , along the null hypersurface). Specifically, it\nis always possible to find such diffeomorphisms that preserve the normal to \u2202M(u) but under which\n\u03bd|\u2202Mu \u2192 \u03bd|\u2202Mu + e\u03c3 Lu f\u2212 (w, \u03b8i ).\n\nand hence a definition of \u03c3 which would depend on \u03bb on\n\u2202MI . In the scenario we consider here, it is more natural\nto remove the ambiguity in \u03bd on \u2202Mu by fixing the definition of \u03c3 initially (i.e. on \u2202MI ). This is achieved by\npicking a preferred radial coordinate r on \u2202MI . More\nexactly, we should specify the r on \u2202MI up to resid(u)\nual coordinate transformations that leave IGHY invariant. We noted above that since the S(u,w) , which are\nthe surfaces of constant r on \u2202MI , are closed 2-surfaces,\nour r represents a radial coordinate on \u2202MI . A simple and natural definition of r (up to residual coordinate\ntransformations) is then to pick it so that the average\nscalar curvature of the conformal 2-surface at \u03c4 = 0 and\nr = const (and described by the metric h\u0304ij = e\u22122\u03c3 hij ) is\n2/r2 with r = u = \u2212w on \u2202MI . By the Gauss-Bonnet\ntheorem, this is equivalent choosing r so that the surface\narea of the conformal 2-surface is 4\u03c0r2 . This choice does\nnot uniquely determine r but it is sufficient to fix \u03bd on\n\u2202Mu .\nThe choice of a preferred r on \u2202MI is equivalent to the\nspecification of an unambiguous boundary term on \u2202Mu .\nMaking such a specification requires that one replace \u03bd in\n(u)\nIGHY by some quantity that is invariant under diffeomorphisms that vanish normal to \u2202Mu and \u2202MI . Any such\nchoice will then pick out a preferred set of definitions of\nw on \u2202Mu for which \u03bd = \u2212Ln \u03c3 and hence the total action is first order. This in turns picks out a preferred set\nof 2r = (u \u2212 w) on \u2202MI where w = \u2212u. For the application of our proposal to cosmology in this section we\nfix the definition of \u03bd so that on \u2202MI , R\u0304 \u03c4 =0 = 2/r2 .\nThis is arguably the simplest choice we can make that\nis consistent with the requirement that the initial state\nbe \u03bb independent when described in the coordinate chart\nfor which the action is (up to a boundary term on \u2202MI )\nfirst order in metric derivatives.\n\n(u)\n\nfor any f\u2212 (w, \u03b8i ). This means that the IGHY term as\ndefined above is ambiguous. The ambiguity in the GHY\nterm for null boundaries is because the 3-metric normal\nto the boundary is degenerate. This means that there is\nno preferred normalization of the normal to the boundary\nand consequently no preferred 'radial' coordinate along\n(u)\nthe boundary. To unambiguously define the IGHY one\nmust fix this remaining gauge freedom by either picking\na form for \u03bd on \u2202M(u) or, equivalently, by specifying\na preferred choice of w/\u03c4 on \u2202Mu . Simplifying choices\nthat are common in the literature, and can always be\nachieved, are\n\u03bd|\u2202Mu = 0\n\nor\n\n\u03bd|\u2202Mu = \u2212\n\nc0\nK,\n2\n\nfor some constant c0 . Each choice identifies a preferred\nw for which the total action is first order in derivatives of\nmetric quantities. In this application of our proposal to\nsolve the CC problems, we demand that the initial state\nis fixed independent of \u03bb. However, both these choices\nfor \u03bd on \u2202Mu given above would single out a preferred w,\n\n2.\n\nYC term on \u2202MI (\u03c4 = 0):\n\nThe initial time-like hypersurface, \u2202MI , is singular,\nhowever we may still define the surface term by taking a\nlimit as \u03c4 \u2192 0 from above (i.e. \u03c4 \u2192 0+ ). We take t\u03bc =\ne\u03c3 \u2207\u03bc \u03c4 where \u03c4 = (u + w)/2. We then have t\u03bc t\u03bc = \u22121;\nt\u03bc is the backward pointing normal to surfaces, \u03a3\u03c4 , of\nconstant \u03c4 . We can decompose the metric into\ng\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212t\u03bc t\u03bd + \u03b3\u03bc\u03bd .\nWith r = (u \u2212 w)/2, we have:\n\u0002\n\u0003\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd = e2\u03c3 dr2 +hij d\u03b8i + K i dr d\u03b8j + K j dr ,\nwhere K i = (ri \u2212 si ). The \u03b8i are the intrinsic coordinates\non the surfaces of constant u and w. The line element\nfor the 4-metric can then be written as\n\u0002\n\u0003\nds2 = \u2212e\u03c3 d\u03c4 2 + \u03b3\u03b1\u03b2 [ dx\u03b1 + N \u03b1 d\u03c4 ] dx\u03b2 + N \u03b2 d\u03c4 ,\nwhere\n\nN\u03b1 dx\u03b1 = hij (rj + sj ) d\u03b8i .\n\n\f11\nWe call N \u03b1 the shift-vector. We note that we can always\ndefine the \u03b8i so that in M, N \u03b1 = 0 i.e. ri = \u2212si . The\nextrinsic curvature, K \u03bc\u03bd , of \u03a3\u03c4 is given by\n1\nK \u03bc\u03bd = \u2212 \u03b3 \u03bc\u03c1 \u03b3 \u03bd\u03c3 Lt \u03b3\u03c1\u03c3 ,\n2\nand the trace is K = K \u03bc\u03bd \u03b3\u03bc\u03bd .

We see that the boundary terms in\nEq. (7) vanish when K and either \u03b3\u0303\u03b1\u03b2 or \u03c3 \u03b1\u03b2 are fixed\non \u2202MI (up to residual coordinate transformations\n\b on\n\u2202MI ) and si , hij and \u03c3 are fixed on \u2202Mu . The QA\nwill be a subset of these quantities, and their defining\nproperty is that they are a maximal subset which can be\nindependently specified.\n\nIn terms of the familiar 3+1 ADM decomposition on\nconstant time (i.e. \u03c4 ) hypersurfaces, \u03a3\u03c4 , our e\u03c3 is the\nlapse function and N \u03b1 = (0, ri + sj ) is the shift vector;\n\u03b3\u03b1\u03b2 is the induced metric on \u03a3\u03c4 . The six components of\n\u03b3\u03b1\u03b2 are given by \u03c3, K i = ri \u2212 si , and hij .\nIn general, the intrinsic coordinate-independent geometry in M is determined uniquely when the twelve variables \u03b3\u03b1\u03b2 and K \u03b1\u03b2 are specified on \u2202MI . The Einstein equations provide four constraint equations on \u2202MI\nwhich reduce the number of independent functions in \u03b3\u03b1\u03b2\nand K \u03b1\u03b2 to eight. When N = e\u03c3 and N \u03b1 in M are\nfixed, this reduces the number of independent functions\nthat must be specified on \u2202MI to four. Thus, to completely specify the space-time in M, we must fix four free\nfunctions on \u2202MI as well as specifying N and N \u03b1 in M.\nThe specification of \u03b3\u0303\u03b1\u03b2 (or \u03c3 \u03b1\u03b2 ) and K on \u2202MI fixes\nsix functions on the initial hypersurface in a coordinate\n(u)\ndependent manner. We found that the definition of IGHY\nresulted in the specification of a preferred r on \u2202MI .\nThere remains, however, the freedom to define the \u03b8i on\n\u2202MI which can be used, for instance, to set K i = 0\ninitially. This freedom means that \u03b3\u0303\u03b1\u03b2 (or \u03c3 \u03b1\u03b2 ) and K\non \u2202MI fix four free functions on \u2202MI in a coordinate\nindependent manner. The lapse function, N , in M to\nbe given by N = e\u03c3 . If N \u03b1 can be fixed in M, then\n\u03b3\u0303\u03b1\u03b2 (or \u03c3 \u03b1\u03b2 ) and K on \u2202MI are sufficient to completely\ndetermine, via the field equations, all metric quantities\nin M, and on \u2202Mu . Fixing N \u03b1 in terms other metric\nquantities is equivalent to fixing ri + si which in turn\nis equivalent to specifying our coordinates \u03b8i on S(u,w)\nwhich are defined on surfaces of constant \u03c4 relative to\ntheir values on \u2202MI . A simple choice with a geometrical basis is demand that the \u03b8i are Lie-propagated along\n\u03c4 \u03bc = \u2207\u03bc \u03c4 from the values that are arbitrarily assigned\nto them on the initial hypersurface \u2202MI i.e. L\u03c4 \u03b8i = 0.\nThis implies that:\nL\u03c4 \u03b8i =\n\n\u0001\n1 \u03bc\nu \u2202\u03bc \u03b8i + w\u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03b8i = e\u22122\u03c3 (ri + si ) = 0,\n2\n\nand so ri = \u2212si in M. We then have N \u03b1 = 0. We make\nthis choice in our subsequent analysis.\n\b\nOur choice of fixed quantities, QA , is therefore as\nfollows:\n\u2022 We assume that\bthe initial state on \u2202MI is fixed.\nThus, the fixed QA include K and either \u03b3\u0303\u03bc\u03bd or\n\u03c3 \u03b1\u03b2 on \u2202MI .\n\u2022 These quantities are fixed with respect to a \u03bbindependent coordinate chart C = u, w, \u03b81 , \u03b82 defined such that u = \u03c40 = fixed on \u2202MI , w = \u03c40 =\nfixed at p0 and u = \u2212w on \u2202MI . \u2202MI has fixed\nunit normal t\u03bcI = e\u2212\u03c3 \u03c4 \u03bc |\u2202MI ; \u03c4 \u03bc = \u2207\u03bc (u + w)/2.\n\u2022 We found that an invariant definition of the boundary term on \u2202Mu requires us to pick out a preferred\nset of r = (u \u2212 w)/2 on \u2202MI . Our choice of r is to\ndefine it so that e\u22122\u03c3 r\u22122 hij has an average scalar\ncurvature of 2 on \u2202MI .\n\n\f12\n\u2022 The values \u03b8i in M are defined by Lie-propagating\ntheir values on \u2202MI along \u03c4 \u03bc : L\u03c4 \u03b8i = 0 and so\nri = \u2212si everywhere.\nSimilarly, for the matter variables, we fix the initial\nstate on \u2202MI and any residual gauge freedom on \u2202Mu ,\nso that the gauge is fixed\nindependently of \u03bb.\n\b\nGiven this choice QA , the 2-metric, hij , on \u2202Mu\nis determined by the classical field equations. Since the\nfield equations depend on \u039b, this, in turn, fixes the form\nof Hij \u2261 dhij / d\u03bb.\n4.\n\nThe \u039b field equation:\n\nThe field equation for \u039b in our proposed paradigm is\nEq.

This determines\n\u03b3\u0307 and hence f+,x (x, \u03b8, \u03c6) in terms of f\u2212,x (x, \u03b8, \u03c6). For\nsimplicity, we choose the fixed hypersurface to be T = 0,\nalthough similar choices that coincide with this choice\nto zeroth order in the small quantities will give similar\nresults to the ones we obtain below. The boundary term\n(u)\nIGHY can then be fixed by specifying \u03b3 \u2032\u2032\u2032 on \u2202MI . It can\nbe checked that fixing r so that the average curvature of\nthe conformal 2-metric on \u2202MI is 2/r2 gives \u03b3 \u2032\u2032\u2032 = 0, and\n(u)\nhence clearly fixes IGHY . We therefore make this choice\nfor r on \u2202MI .\n2.\n\nEvaluation of Iclass\n\nWe can calculate the \u0393 quantity defined by Eq. (8)\nfor this line element.

To leading order, we have U \u03c4 U\u03b1 = \u2212v,\u03b1\nfor \u03b1 = 1, 2, 3.

Formally, the Lmatter\nthat appears in Iclass is the quantum effective matter Lagrangian, Leff\nmatter , rather than the classical matter action.\nThe since the quantum vacuum energy associated with\nthe matter have been subsumed into the definition of \u039b,\nthis Leff\nmatter vanishes, by definition, in the vacuum. Let\nnA represent a set of conversed quantities associated with\nthe matter species, such that in the vacuum nA = 0. For\ninstance, an nA could be baryon number.

The dominant contribution to Pm\nis then from photons (and light neutrinos) and may be\napproximated as homogeneous to the order to which we\nwork i.e. \u03b4Pm /\u03c1m \u226a \u03a6, \u03a8. We therefore take Pm = P\u0304 (\u03c4 ).\nThe quantities a(\u03c4 ), \u03a8 and \u03a6 are then given by\n\u0010 a \u00112\nk\n8\u03c0G\u03c1\u0304 \u039b\n1\n,\u03c4\n+ \u2212 2,\n=\nH 2 = 2 H2 =\na\na2\n3\n3\na\n\u03c1\u0304 \u0307 = \u22123H(\u03c1\u0304 + P\u0304 ),\n~ 2 \u03a6 = 4\u03c0Ga2 \u03b4\u03c1,\n\u03a6 = \u03a8,\n\u2207\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u03a6\u0308 + 3H\u03a6\u0307 + 2\u1e22 + H2 \u03a6 = 0,\n~ 2 = \u03b4 \u03b1\u03b2 \u2202\u03b1 \u2202\u03b2 with \u03b1, \u03b2 = 1, 2, 3.\nwhere H = a,\u03c4 /a, and \u2207\nWe also have that P r r = T\u03bc\u03bd l\u03bc l\u03bd is (to linear order):\nPrr = P\u0304 (\u03c4 ).\n\nThus, to linear order in \u03a6 and \u03b3,\u03bc\u03bd , we have\nZ \u03c40 \u2212\u03c4\nZ\nZ \u03c40\n\u0002\na4 (\u03c4 )\nr2 dr\nd2 \u03a9 \u03ba\u22121 \u0393\nIclass =\n0\n0\n\u0003\n+(Lmatter \u2212 P\u0304 ) ,\n\n(14)\n\neff\nWe recognize that Im\n[nA ] is the quantum effective matter action, normalized so that it vanishes in vacuo.\nFor free fields, the quantum effective action has the\nsame structure as the classical action. It is well known\neff\nthat Im\nand hence Lmatter vanishes identically for free\nfundamental fermion fields. For fermion fields, \u03c8, with\nenergy density \u03c1\u03c8 , that are weakly coupled to a gauge\nfields with a coupling constant g \u226a 1 one typically has\nLmatter \u223c O(g 4 )\u03c1\u03c8 \u226a \u03c1\u03c8 .\ncl\nFor photons, to leading order Leff\nmatter \u2248 Lmatter =\n\u03bc\u03bd\n2\n2\n\u2212F\u03bc\u03bd F /4 = (E \u2212 B )/2, and for radiation E 2 = B 2\nand so Lmatter = 0. More generally, for an (approximately) free field, \u03c6A , with energy \u03c9 \u226b H, Leff\nmatter \u2248\nLcl\nmatter and the average value of the effective Lagrangian\nis proportional to the dispersion relation and so, on-shell,\nso we have Lmatter . O(H/\u03c9)\u03c1matter \u226a \u03c1matter for the\ncontribution from \u03c6A . Since the mass of dark matter particles is \u226b H today, we assume there their contribution\nto Lmatter is much less than their energy density.\n\n\f15\nTherefore, amongst the fields that contribute to Iclass ,\nthe dominant contribution to Lmatter at late times is\nexpected to come from baryonic matter. Baryons contribute most because they are not fundamental fermions\nfields, but composite particles consisting of quarks bound\nstrongly together with gluons.\nWe define \u03c1baryon and nbaryon to be the baryon energy\nand number density respectively.

Lcl\nQCD is the classical action for Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).

At late times when the baryonic matter is\nnon-relativistic, and at sub-nuclear densities (\u03c1baryon \u226a\neff\neff\n1017 kg m\u22123 on average), we have Im\n\u2248 Im\n[nbaryon ] and\nZ\n\u221a\neff\n\u2212gnbaryon d4 x.\nIm\n[nbaryon ] \u2248 \u2212\u0393b\nM\n\nfor some constant \u0393b . At late times, for non-relativistic\nbaryonic matter, \u03c1baryon = MN nbaryon , where MN is the\nnucleon mass. We define the constant \u03b6b = \u0393b /MN . For\nbaryonic matter we it follows that:\nLeff\nmatter \u2248 \u2212\u03b6b \u03c1baryon .\n\n(18)\n\nIn principle, \u03b6b is calculable and depends only on QCD\nphysics. A full calculation of \u03b6b would, however, require\neither the derivation of the complete low-energy effective\naction for QCD, or a time consuming and technically\nchallenging lattice QCD calculation. Both of these are\nfar beyond the scope of this work.\nThe chiral bag model (CBM) for nucleons is described\nby the effective Lagrangian:\n\u0001\nLCBM = \u03c8\u0304i\u03b3 \u03bc \u2207\u03bc \u03c8 \u2212 B \u03b8(R \u2212 r)\n(19)\n1 i~\u03c4f*~\u03c0\u03b35\n\u2212 \u03c8\u0304e \u03c0 \u03c8\u03b4(r \u2212 R) \u2212 L\u03c0 \u03b8(r \u2212 R),\n2\n1\nf\u03c02\n2\ntr [L\u03bc , L\u03bd ] ,\nL\u03c0 = \u2212 tr [L\u03bc L\u03bc ] +\n4\n32e2\ni~\n\u03c4 *~\n\u03c0\nL\u03bc = (\u2207\u03bc U )U \u2020 ,\nU = e f\u03c0 .\nHere, R is the 'bag radius', and B is the 'bag constant'\nwhich has been interpreted as the difference between the\nvacuum energy of the perturbative and non-perturbative\nQCD vacuums; L\u03c0 is the Skyrme action. In r < R,\n\ni.e. inside the bag, just free quarks and the bag constant contribute to the mass and the action. Outside the\nbag quark degrees of freedom have been confined and\nmesons are the effective degrees of freedom. We use the\nCBM model to approximate the effective matter action\nLeff\nmatter \u2248 LCBM .\nThe total energy-momentum tensor is:\n\u03bc\u03bd\nTCBM\n= Tq\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 Bg \u03bc\u03bd \u03b8(R \u2212 r) + T\u03c0\u03bc\u03bd .\n\nwhere Tq\u03bc\u03bd g\u03bc\u03bd = 0.

For this value they\nhave Mq \u2248 M\u03c0 + MB where MB = 4\u03c0BR3 /3. Thus we\nhave \u03b6b \u2248 0.5. This estimate will be slightly reduced\nwhen the contributions of spin to the nucleon mass are\ntaken into account\nHenceforth, we take:\nLmatter = \u2212\u03b6b \u03c1baryon ,\n\nwhere from the CBM we use the estimate that \u03b6b \u2248 1/2.\n4.\n\n\u039b Equation\n\nThe dominant contribution to the pressure term, P\u0304 , at\nlate times will come from radiation.

To this order the only\nquantity in Iclass that depends on \u039b is a(\u03c4 ), since we\nhave assumed the initial conditions that determine k are\nfixed. Additionally, baryogenesis and the processes which\ngenerates the dark matter density must occur at such\nearly times that they will have only a negligible \u039b dependence. This implies that a3 \u03c1m and a3 \u03c1baryon are fixed\nindependently of \u039b. Additionally, the initial conditions\nfix a3 n\u03b3 , where n\u03b3 is the photon number density, independently of \u039b. Given this, the \u039b independent initial\n\nconditions for the matter sector are parametrized by the\nenergy of matter energy per photon, \u03be = \u03c1m /n\u03b3 = const\nand the baryon energy per photon, \u03beb = \u03c1baryon /ngamma ;\n\u03b4\u03be/\u03b4\u039b = \u03b4\u03beb /\u03b4\u039b = 0. The measured values \u03be and \u03beb are\n\u03be = 3.43 eV and \u03beb = 0.54 eV..\nWe define\nA(\u03c4 ) =\n\n\u03b4 ln a\n\u03b4\u039b\n\nand use the Friedmann equation for the background to\ncalculate A(\u03c4 ). Under the change \u039b \u2192 \u039b + \u03b4\u039b the Friedmann equation is perturbed to\n2H\u03b4H = 2H,\u03c4 \u03b4 ln a + a2 \u03b4\u039b/3.\nNow H = \u0227/a and so \u03b4H = (\u03b4 ln a),\u03c4 and thus \u03b4H/\u03b4\u039b =\nA,\u03c4 . It follows that:\n\u0012 \u0013\na2\na2\nA\n=\n.\n,\u21d2\n6\nH ,\u03c4\n6H2\nThe condition that the extrinsic curvature, K, of the\ninitial hypersurface be fixed independently of \u039b is equivalent to \u03b4H/\u03b4\u039b = 0 at \u03c4 = 0 where H = H/a. This\ncondition is equivalent A,\u03c4 \u2212 HA = 0 at \u03c4 = 0. Inserting\nthis condition into the above equation for (A/H),\u03c4 , we\nfind that at \u03c4 = 0, A/H = a2 /6H(H2 \u2212 H,\u03c4 ) which vanishes at \u03c4 = 0 as a = 1/H = 0 there. Thus, using this\nboundary condition and integrating the above equation\nfor (A/H),\u03c4 we arrive at\nH\u0226 \u2212 \u1e22A =\n\nA(\u03c4 ) = H\n\nZ\n\n\u03c4\n0\n\na2 (\u03c4 \u2032 ) d\u03c4 \u2032\n.\n6H2 (\u03c4 \u2032 )\n\nWe make the definitions H0 = H(\u03c4 = \u03c40 ), a0 = a(\u03c40 )\nand \u03a9baryon0 = \u03ba\u03c1baryon (\u03c40 )/3H02 , and then a4 \u03ba\u03c1baryon =\n3a(\u03c4 )a30 \u03a9b0 H02 .

With all other quantities fixed, Eq. (26)\ngives k = k0 (\u039b) where the form of k0 (\u039b) follows from Eq.\n(26). We can invert this to give \u039b = \u039b0 (k). In FIG. 2a\n\n\f17\nand Table I we show the value of k required for different\nvalues of \u039b for an observation time: t = tU \u2248 13.77 Gyrs.\nIn both the table and the figure, k is given in units of\na2\u22c6 H\u22c62 where 1/(a\u22c6 H\u22c6 ) is a fixed comoving length scale\nthat is equal to 1/(a0 H0 ) when \u039b = \u039bobs . We see that\nlarge values of \u039b require smaller values of k.\nWe find that when \u03a9m0 \u2248 1\u2212\u03a9\u039b0 , N (\u03c40 ; \u039b) \u2248 N\u0304 (\u03a9\u039b0 )\nfor any \u03c40 i.e. N is determined entirely by \u03a9\u039b0 . Thus,\nby Eq.

We illustrate this in FIG. 2b, where we plot \u22122\u03a9k0 /\u03b6b \u03a9b0 against\n\u03a9m0 \u2248 1 \u2212 \u03a9\u039b0 .

We can therefore test\nthe validity of our model by checking that the consistency equation, Eq. (26), is indeed consistent with the\nobservational limits on \u039b, \u03a9b0 and \u03a9k0 . We note that\nN > 0 and so our model requires that k/\u03b6b > 0 or equivalently \u03a9k0 /\u03b6b < 0. Our estimate of \u03b6b from the chiral\nbag model of baryons in QCD gives \u03b6b > 0. Current observations only bound the value of \u03a9k0 and those bounds\nare consistent with \u03a9k0 = 0. The values of \u039b and \u03a9b0\nare relatively well established.\nThe most recent 1\u03c3 limit on \u03a9k0 from WMAP 7 combined with BAO and H0 data (and \u039bCDM prior) is [15]:\n\u03a9k0 = \u22120.0023+0.0054\n\u22120.0056.\n\n(27)\n\nWhen our model is applied to our universe with \u03a9\u039b0 =\n\u039b/3H02 = 0.73, \u03a9b0 = 0.0423, as observed at a present\ntime when the CMB temperature is 2.725 k, Eq. (26)\npredicts the value of \u03a9k0 to be:\n\u0010 \u0011\n\u03b6b\n\u03a9k0 = \u22120.0056 1/2\n,\n(28)\n\nwhich is consistent with the observational limit at 1\u03c3\nfor \u03b6b \u2208 (0, 0.7] and within the 95% confidence limit for\nall \u03b6b \u2208 (0, 1]. For the estimated value of \u03b6b = 1/2,\nour model predicts \u03a9k0 = \u22120.0056. The combination\nof data from the Planck CMB survey with current and\nfuture measurements of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations\n(BAO) should be able to confirm or refute this detailed\nprediction. Therefore, in contrast to other proposals for\nsolving the CC problems, our model makes a testable\nprediction and is falsifiable in the near future.\nC.\n\nTABLE I: \u039b in the history seen by an observer at time\ntU \u2248 13.77 Gyrs for different values of the spatial curvature\nparameter, k. Here, \u03b6b is a QCD constant related to baryon\nstructure, and we expect \u03b6b \u2248 1/2; \u039bobs is the particular value\nof \u039b we observe, and a\u22c6 H\u22c6 is the value of a(\u03c4 )H(\u03c4 ) today in\nour visible universe. We have taken the matter energy per\nphoton to be \u03be = 3.43 eV, and the baryon energy per photon\nis \u03beb = 0.54 eV.\n\nWhat is a Natural Value of \u039b?\n\nWe have seen that, at a fixed time, our model predicts\nthe value of \u039b in terms the spatial curvature k. In inflationary models, the magnitude of spatial curvature k\n\ninside the past light cone is determined by the duration\nof the inflationary period in the earlier universe, specified\nby the number of e-folds N . In most inflationary scenario\none imagines that there are many different inflating regions, or \"bubble universes\". In each bubble the initial\nconditions for the scalar field will differ. The number of\ne-folds of inflation experienced by a bubble universe depends on these initial conditions in a model-dependent\nfashion. The value of N (and hence k) will therefore be\ndifferent in each bubble universe. The curvature parameter k is therefore an environmentally sensitive parameter:\nit depends on the part of universe we observe, and will\nnot be the same everywhere. In our model, when all\nother quantities are fixed, \u039b is given implicitly as a function or k by Eq. (26). Hence, the value of \u039b that one\nobserves at a given time is also an environmentally determined parameter. If we existed in a different bubble\nuniverse with a different value of k, we would observe a\ndifferent value of \u039b. In order for our model to be said to\nsolve the CC problems, the value of \u039b that we do observe\nmust be shown to be in some sense 'natural'. This means\nthat, once selection effects such as the requirement that\n\u039b and k are not so large as to prevent the formation\nof non-linear structure in the universe have been taken\ninto account, the observed value of \u039b should, ideally, be\ntypical amongst all possible bubble universes. One could\nthen conclude that the observable universe is no more fine\ntuned that it must be given that we are here to observe\nit.\nObservers like ourselves require the universe to be old\nenough for a sufficient number of collapsed structures\nsuch as galaxies to have formed, and then for heavy elements to have been formed by stars. If k or \u039b are too\nlarge then either the universe will recollapse before these\nconditions have been achieved or the growth of structure\nwill have been so suppressed that even as t \u2192 \u221e, galaxies\nnever form [23].\n\n\f18\n3\n\n10\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nN(\u03c40,\u039b) = \u22122\u03a9 k0/\u03b6 b \u03a9 b0\n\nSpatial Curvature: k/a 2\u2217 H2\u2217\n\n2\n\n10\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n10\n10\nCosmological Constant: \u039b/\u039b obs\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\n\u221215\n10\n\n\u221210\n\n\u22125\n\n10\n10\nMatter Fraction Today:\u03a9 m 0 \u2248 1\u2212\u03a9\u039b 0\u2212\u03a9k 0\n\n0\n\n10\n\nFIG. 2: (a) The relationship between the value of the spatial curvature k and the value of \u039b that dominants the classical\nhistory. We show k in units of a2\u22c6 H\u22c62 where 1/(a\u22c6 H\u22c6 ) is a fixed comoving length scale that is equal to 1/(a0 H0 ) for the observed\nvalue of \u039b. \u039b is shown relative to the value of \u039b that we observed, \u039bobs . Here the k \u2212 \u039b relationship predicted by our model is\nfor observations at a time t = tU \u2248 13.77 Gyrs. We have also fixed the \u039b independent properties of matter by fixing the matter\nenergy per photon, \u03be, and the baryon energy per photon, \u03beb , to their observed values: \u03be = 3.43 eV, \u03beb = 0.54 eV. We note that\nsmaller values of k correspond to larger values of \u039b. (b) The relationship between \u03a9m0 \u2248 1 \u2212 \u03a9\u039b0 and \u22122\u03a9k0 /\u03b6b \u03a9b0 = N (\u03c40 ; \u039b)\npredicted by our model. When \u03a9m0 \u2248 1 \u2212 \u03a9\u039b0 , we find that when N (\u03c40 ; \u039b) is expressed as a function of \u03a9\u039b0 , it is almost\nindependent of the observation time determined by \u03c40 . For fixed \u03a9b0 /\u03a9m0 and \u03b6b , \u03a9k0 corresponds to a specific value of \u03a9\u039b0\nindependently of \u03c40 . As in (a), we have taken \u03be = 3.43 eV, \u03beb = 0.54 eV.\n\n1.\n\nThe naturalness of \u039b in string landscape models\n\nBefore addressing the naturalness of the observed value\nof \u039b in our model, we consider the extent to which the\nstring landscape model solves the CC problems. The\nstring landscape solution to the cosmological constant\nproblems is totally reliant on anthropic selection effects\nto determine the value of \u039b. In that scenario, it is assumed that there are many different possible vacua, each\nwith a different value of vacuum energy, or equivalently\nof \u039b. The probability of a vacuum having a CC in the\ninterval [\u039b, \u039b + d\u039b] is fprior (\u039b) d\u039b, where fprior (\u039b) is the\nprior probability distribution of \u039b and has not been directly determined by theory. Anthropic selection effects\nprovide the probability, fselec (\u039b), of being able to observe a universe with a given value of \u039b. By Bayes' theorem, the unnormalized probability distribution function\nof observing a vacuum state with a CC in the interval\n[\u039b, \u039b + d\u039b] is:\nf\u039b (\u039b) d\u039b = fselec (\u039b)fprior (\u039b) d\u039b.\nThe form of fselec (\u039b) can be estimated by taking the\nnumber of galaxies (collapsed structures with a given\nmass) as a proxy for the number of observers, see for\ninstance Ref. [41] for such a calculation. However, without knowing the form of fprior (\u039b), it is not possible to say\nwhether or not the observed value of \u039b is natural. Some\nauthors argue that a uniform prior is the most reasonable\nfor small values of \u039b. If this is the case then, as shown\nin Ref. [41], when all other parameters are fixed, the\nobserved value of \u039b is not atypical, although the most\n\nprobable values are still an order of magnitude or two\nlarger. Specifically, with a uniform prior, and fselec from\nRef. [41], one finds\n\u039b\n< 44.63,\n\u039bobs\n\u039b\n0.40 <\n< 123.68,\n\u039bobs\n2.84 <\n\n(68% Confidence), (29)\n(95% Confidence),\n\nwhere \u039bobs is the particular value of \u039b that we observe.\nHence, with a uniform prior, this value is outside the\n68% confidence limit by about a factor of 2.8 but inside\nthe 95% confidence interval. The observed value of \u039b is\ntherefore small but not atypically small here.\nA uniform prior is not, however, the only reasonable choice one could make for fprior (\u039b).\nA logprior, fprior d\u039b \u221d d ln \u039b, or an exponential, fprior \u221d\nexp(3\u03c0/G\u039b), have also be supported by theoretical arguments and in both cases the most probable values of\n\u039b would be many orders of magnitude smaller than the\nobserved value. In the string landscape and other multiverse models, the natural value of \u039b is crucially dependent on the choice of prior, and until the prior can be\ncalculated from first principles using the theory it is not\nclear whether this model provides an natural explanation\nfor the observed value of \u039b.\n2.\n\nThe naturalness of \u039b in our model\n\nIn our model, we shall see below that, just as in landscape and other multiverse models, anthropic selection\n\n\f19\n\n0.3\nmodel\n\nobs\n\n0.2\n\n68% Confidence Interval\n95% Confidence Interval\n\n0.15\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n\n0\n\u22122\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n10\n10\nCosmological Constant: \u039b/\u039b\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\nobs\n\n\u22123N\n\n(II): f (N) \u2248 c(N)e\nN\nt\n\u2248 13.7 Gyrs\n\n68% Confidence Interval\n\n(\u039b)\n\n(I): f (N) \u2248 c(N)\nN\nt\n\u2248 13.7 Gyrs\n\nPredicted Prior Probability Distribution: \u039b f\n\nPredicted Prior Probability Distribution: \u039b f\n\nmodel\n\n(\u039b)\n\n0.25\n\n0.25\n\nobs\n\n95% Confidence Interval\n\n0.2\n\n0.15\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n\n0\n\u22122\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n10\n10\nCosmological Constant: \u039b/\u039b\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\nobs\n\nFIG. 3: Our model's prediction for the (prior) probability distribution, fmodel (\u039b), for the value of cosmological constant \u039b that\none would measure at an observation time t = tU = 13.77 Gyrs. In our theory, the observed value of \u039b is given as a function of\nthe spatial curvature, k, inside the observer's past light cone. The curvature parameter k depends on N , the number of e-folds\nof inflation. Hence, ultimately, the probability of astronomers observing a given value of \u039b depends on the prior probability\nof living in a bubble universe where the universe underwent N e-folds of inflation. The probability distribution function of N\nis fN (N ). Given an fN (N ), our model completely determines the prior probability distribution function, fmodel (\u039b). We have\nplotted fmodel (\u039b) for two different choices of fN (N ). Case I is where fN (N ) = c(N ) where c(N ) \u2248 const for changes, \u2206N , in\nN over less than \u2248 2.5% (e.g. a power-law N \u2212p for |p| < 10). Case II is where fN = c(N )e\u22123N where again c(N ) \u2248 const\nfor \u2206N/N . 2.5%. This latter choice is the one calculated in Ref. [42] for slow-roll single-field inflation. In our model this\nprediction for the prior probability is independent of the fundamental prior weighting of different values of \u039b in the partition\nfunction. Our fmodel (\u039b) does not include any observer-dependent selection effects, apart from the requirement that a classical\nsolution exists. The observed value of \u039b is shown by a dotted black line, and the whole shaded region is the symmetric 95%\nconfidence interval. The darker shaded area is the symmetric 68% confidence interval. In Case I we have calculated the\nconfidence intervals by sharply cutting off fmodel for \u039b > 103 \u039bobs , since such large values of the CC are incompatible with\nthe existence of galaxies. For \u039b < 103 \u039bobs we have not included any weighting by probability of living in a universe with a\ngiven \u039b. For these natural choices of fN (N ), the observed value of \u039b is within the 95% confidence interval in both cases, and\nwell within it for fN = c(N )e\u22123N . In both cases, \u039b = \u039bobs is not atypical whatever precise form of the observer conditioned\nselection effect parametrized by fselec (\u039b). When selection effects are included the probability of larger values \u039b & 100\u039bobs is\nfurther suppressed, and the observed value moves within the 1-\u03c3 confidence interval for Case II, and just outside this interval\nin Case I. This is shown in FIG 4 below. We have taken the matter energy per photon to be \u03be = 3.43 eV, and the baryon\nenergy per photon is \u03beb = 0.54 eV, as is observed.\n\nstill plays a role in limiting the maximum allowed values\nof \u039b. The equivalent prior on \u039b in our model is the undetermined measure \u03bc[\u039b] in the partition function. Unlike\nfor landscape or multiverse models though, this unknown\nprior on \u039b plays no role. This is because our model requires \u039b = \u039b0 (k) and \u039b0 (k) is a function of k that is\ngiven by our model. Thus, whatever the prior on \u039b, the\nnormalized posterior probability distribution of \u039b given\nk is a delta-function,\nf\u039b|k (\u039b; k) = \u03b4(\u039b \u2212 \u039b0 (k)),\nwhere \u039b0 (k) also depends on the size of the observer's\npast light cone, M, and hence observation time. Given\nthat one lives in a bubble universe with a certain value\nof k, and observes it at a given time, in our model there\nis only one value that \u039b can take. The probability of\nmeasuring a \u039b in a given range is then given entirely by\nthe probability of measuring k in a corresponding range.\nIt is independent of the measure, or prior, \u03bc[\u039b].\nNow the curvature parameter k is related to the number of e-folds N , since k = k(N ) = k\u0304e2(N\u0304 \u2212N ) for some\n\nfixed N0 and k\u0304. As above, 1/(a\u22c6 H\u22c6 ) is a comoving length\nscale equal to 1/a0 H0 in our particular universe. In the\nexpression for k(N ), N\u0304 is the number of e-folds required\nto bring about the bound |\u03a9k | < |k\u0304|/H\u22c62 a2\u22c6 today. We\nare free to take |k\u0304| = 10\u22122 a2\u22c6 H\u22c62 . Depending on the efficiency of reheating after the end of inflation, we have\nN\u0304 & 50 \u2212 62 in realistic inflation models.\nThe probability distribution for k in different bubble universes, fk (k) dk, is therefore given by fN (N ) dN ,\nthe probability distribution of the number of e-folds, N .\nSpecifically, we have\nfk (k(N )) = fN (N )\n\ndN\nfN (N (k))\n.\n=\ndk\n2k\n\nThe calculation of fN (N ) dN , that is of the probability\nthat the number of e-folds lies in the region [N, N + dN ]\nis the measure problem for inflation, and has been the\nsubject of a considerable amount of work and debate as\nto which is the correct measure.

Here, \u039bobs is the particular value of \u039b that we have observed.\nIn our theory, the observed value of \u039b is given as a function of the spatial curvature, k, inside the observer's past light cone.\nThe curvature parameter k depends on N , the number of e-folds of inflation. Hence, ultimately, the probability of astronomers\nobserving a given value of \u039b depends on the prior probability of living in a bubble universe where the universe underwent N\ne-folds of inflation. The probability distribution function of N is fN (N ). Given an fN (N ), our model completely determines the\nprobability distribution function, fmodel (\u039b), of \u039b prior to the inclusion of selection effects. In the above plots we have included\nthe limits on \u039b due to observational selection effects using the prescription for fselec given by Tegmark et al. in [41] which uses\nthe number of galaxies as a proxy for the number of observers. When these are included, the full posterior probability of living\nin a bubble universe where one observes a given value of \u039b is f\u039b (\u039b). Additionally, we find that the inclusion of selection effects\nmakes f\u039b (\u039b) only relatively weakly dependent on the form of fN (N ) because for allowed values of \u039b, the required k (and hence\nN ) vary only over a small range. We have plotted f\u039b (\u039b) for two different choices of fN (N ). Case I is where fN (N ) = c(N )\nwhere c(N ) \u2248 const for changes, \u2206N , in N over less than \u2248 2.5% (e.g. a power-law N \u2212p for |p| < 10). Case II is where\nfN = c(N )e\u22123N where again c(N ) \u2248 const for \u2206N/N . 2.5%. This latter choice is the one calculated in Ref. [42] for slow-roll\nsingle-field inflation. In both cases we see that the observed value of \u039b (dotted black line) is well inside the 95% confidence\ninterval (the shaded areas), and near the boundary of the 68% confidence interval (the more darkly shaded area). In Case I,\n\u039b = \u039bobs is just outside this interval, whereas in Case II it is just inside it. In both cases, it is clear that the observed value\nof \u039b is typical and can be explained without the need for fine tuning. We have taken the matter energy per photon to be\n\u03be = 3.43 eV, and the baryon energy per photon is \u03beb = 0.54 eV for all values of \u039b.\n\ntonian of general relativity [43], to show that in singlefield, slow-roll inflation, fN (N ) = c(N )e\u22123N , where c(N )\nis model dependent but generally changes much more\nslowly with N than exp(\u22123N ). The exp(\u22123N ) suppression indicates that the region of phase space that results\nin a long-lived period of slow-roll inflation is very small\n(however, the result is to some extent just an artefact\nof having no high-energy cut-off where the theory inevitably breaks down). To find this fN , Gibbons and\nTurok (GT) have to regularize the canonical measure\nby imposing a cut-off on the curvature and the end of\ninflation or equivalently on the scale factor at the end\nof inflation i.e. a < amax . The regularized measure is\nthen \u221d a3max . If one takes amax to be independent of\nN , then it drops out of the normalized probability distribution for N , and fN (N ) \u221d e\u22123N . An alternative\nprocedure would be to place the cut-off on the curvature at the beginning of inflation or, equivalently, on the\nscale-factor there. In this case, at the end of inflation,\na < amax \u221d eN . We would then have fN \u2192 e3N fN (N ),\nand so fN = c(N ). This procedure factors in a weighting\nby volume. Another example where fN = c(N ) and c(N )\nvarys much more slowly with N than exp(\u22123N ) was es-\n\ntimated by Freivogel, Kleban, Rodriguez Martinez, and\nSusskind (FKRMS), and then extended by De Simone\nand Salem in the context of eternal inflationary models\non the string landscape [44, 45]. They found fN \u221d N \u22124 .\nOur model unambiguously predicts the prior probability of living in a universe with effective CC in the interval\n[\u039b, \u039b + d\u039b]. We define this to be fmodel(\u039b) d\u039b, and it is\ngiven (up to a calculable normalization factor) by\nZ\nfmodel(\u039b) =\ndk f\u039b|k (\u039b; k)fk (k),\n(30)\n=\n\nfN (N (k0 (\u039b))) d ln k0 (\u039b)\n,\n2\nd\u039b\n\nwhere k0 (\u039b) follows from Eq. (26). Note that k0 (\u039b) also\ndepends on the observation time, and the matter/baryon\nenergy per photon. Depending on the form of fN (N ), the\nprediction for fmodel(\u039b) may indicate that the observed\nvalue of \u039b is natural independently of selection effects\nconditioned on the existence of observers. We discuss\nthis point below.\nThe dependence on the precise form of fN (N ) is greatly\nweakened when selection effects on \u039b are included. Then,\n\n\f21\nwe have that, in our model, the (unnormalised) posterior\nprobability of living in a universe with effective CC in\nthe interval [\u039b, \u039b + d\u039b] is f\u039b (\u039b) d\u039b, where\nf\u039b (\u039b) = fselec (\u039b)fmodel(\u039b).\nRoughly, the observer-conditioned selection effects on \u039b\nlimit its value to be no more than about 1000 times that\nwhich is observed in our universe (\u039bobs ). Tegmark et al.\n[41] calculated fselec (\u039b) by using the number of galaxies\n(virialized halos with a mass & 1012 M\u2299 ) as a proxy for\nthe number of observers. We use their form of fselec here\nwhen evaluating f\u039b (\u039b).\nUnlike in the string landscape model, f\u039b (\u039b) and\nfmodel(\u039b) have no dependence on the unknown prior\nweighting of different values of \u039b. All that is required\nin order to specify f\u039b (\u039b), or fmodel (\u039b), fully is to specify\nthe prior probability of the number of e-folds, fN (N ). At\npresent, much more is known and and is calculable about\nthe form of fN (N ) for different inflation models than is\nknown about the landscape prior on \u039b. Also, we shall\nsee that f\u039b (\u039b) is much less sensitive to the precise form\nof fN (N ) than the string landscape model is to \u039b-prior.\nIn Table I we provide the value of k (in units of H\u22c62 a2\u22c6 )\nrequired by our model for different values of \u039b at an observational time of 13.77 Gyrs. Larger values of \u039b require\na smaller value of k, and hence a larger value of N . Given\nthat fN (N ) is generally estimated to be a decreasing function of N, this means that the probability of larger values\nof \u039b will be suppressed relative to smaller values. Anthropic limits on \u039b imply that it could not have been\nmore than about 1000 times larger the value we observe.\nIn this allowed range the required k for a given \u039b decreases by less than a factor of 10. Thus, the required\nnumber of e-folds, N = N0 (\u039b) = N (k0 (\u039b), changes by\nless than \u2206N \u2248 \u2206(ln k)/2 . ln(10)/2 \u2248 1.2. At the\nsame time, N0 (\u039b) & N\u0304 > 50 \u2212 62 in realistic models, and\nso \u2206N/N . 0.025. So, unless | d ln fN (N )/ d ln N | & 10\nor so, we have fN (N ) \u2248 const for anthropically allowed\nvalues of \u039b. Such a flat fN (N ) emerges if we weight the\nGT probability distribution for N (which is \u221d e\u22123N ) by\nthe bubble universe 3-volume at any given time, (which\nis \u221d e3N ). We then have fN = c(N ) where c(N ) is fairly\nflat (e.g. c(N ) \u221d N \u22121/2 if the inflationary potential is\n\u221d m2 \u03c62 [42]). The FKRMS estimate of fN \u221d N \u22124 is\nanother example where fN is fairly flat for \u2206N/N \u226a 1\n[44, 45]. In both these cases fN \u2248 const for allowed values\nof \u039b and so the precise form of fN (N ) is unimportant.\nThe GT measure on inflationary solutions has fN \u221d\ne\u22123N and so | d ln fN / d ln N |3N \u226b 10. Thus, if this\nmeasure is correct we should not approximate fN by a\nconstant. We therefore consider this and the fN \u2248 const\ncases separately.\nWe note that if fN (N ) \u221d e\u22123N , the suppression of\nlarge values of N, and of hence large \u039b values, is actually\nsufficient to place the observed value of \u039b within the 95%\nconfidence interval for \u039b prior to the inclusion of selection\neffects. Even if we take fN = c(N ), where c(N ) is fairly\nflat, the \u039bobs is inside 95% confidence interval of the prior\n\nprobability distribution function for \u039b, when one imposes\na sharp cut-off on \u039b > 103 \u039bobs . We illustrate this in FIG.\n3 where we have plotted fmodel(\u039b) for an observation time\nof tU = 13.77 Gyrs. The entire lighter shaded region is\nthe symmetric 95% confidence interval, and the darker\nshaded region is the symmetric 68% confidence interval.\nThe dotted black line marks the observed value of the\nCC, \u039bobs . We see that even before we have included\nselection effects which suppress \u039b \u226b 100\u039bobs outcomes,\nthe observed value of \u039b is not atypical with either general\nform of fN (N ). For comparison, in the multiverse or\nlandscape model with a uniform prior and a sharp cutoff on \u039b > 103 \u039bobs , \u039b \u2264 \u039bobs is much less likely and\nhas a probability of only 0.1% prior to the inclusion of\nselection effects.\nWhilst there are anthropic selection effects on k, these\nare automatically satisfied when k is small enough for\na classical solution to exist. The existence of a classical solution is therefore by far the strongest selection effect on k. Current observational limits require\n\u22120.084 < k/a2\u22c6 H\u22c62 < 0.0133 at 95% confidence, where\n1/a\u22c6 H\u22c6 is the measured value of the comoving Hubble\nradius, rH = 1/aH, today. All the values of k in Table I\nare well within these limits, and so the existence of a classical solution in our model is sufficient to explain why we\nmust live in a bubble universe where k is within the current observational limits, and hence why our observable\nuniverse must have undergone a large number of e-folds\nof inflation, no matter how unlikely that is a priori.\nWe now turn our attention to the posterior probability,\nf\u039b (\u039b) d\u039b, of observing \u039b in the interval [\u039b, \u039b + d\u039b] in\nour model. We consider the consequences of two general\nforms of fN (N ): (I) fN (N ) = c(N ) where c(N ) \u2248 const\nin the allowed range (i.e. less steep than \u223c N \u221210 ) and\n(II) fN (N ) \u2248 c(N )e\u22123N where again c(N ) \u2248 const for\nallowed \u039b values. Finally, for fselec (\u039b) we take the form\ncalculated by Tegmark et al. in Ref. [41].\nIn Case I, with fN (N ) = c(N ) \u2248 const, we have\nf\u039b (\u039b) d\u039b \u221d fselec (\u039b)\n\nd ln k(\u039b)\nd\u039b ,\nd\u039b\n\nand in case II where fN (N ) \u221d c(N )e\u22123N\nf\u039b (\u039b) d\u039b \u221d fselec (\u039b)k 3/2 (\u039b)\n\nd ln k(\u039b)\nd\u039b .\nd\u039b\n\nIn FIG. 4, we plot \u039bf\u039b (\u039b) against ln(\u039b/\u039bobs ) for the\ntwo cases given above. We also show the 68% and 95%\nconfidence limits on \u039b in both cases. In case I, for\nfN (N ) = c(N ) \u2248 const, these limits are:\n\u039b\n< 18.37,\n\u039bobs\n\u039b\n0.19 <\n< 48.13,\n\u039bobs\n1.31 <\n\n(68% Confidence), (31)\n(95% Confidence).\n\nIn case II, where fN (N ) = c(N ) exp(\u22123N ), (c(N ) \u2248\n\n\f22\nFor comparison, with the same selection effects and a\nuniform prior on \u039b, the landscape model gives:\n\nconst) we have:\n\u039b\n< 10.03,\n\u039bobs\n\u039b\n0.11 <\n< 26.27,\n\u039bobs\n0.76 <\n\n(68% Confidence), (32)\nP (0.10 < \u03a9\u039b0 < 0.90) = 11%\nP (0.05 < \u03a9\u039b0 < 0.95) = 16%.\n\n(95% Confidence).\n\nWe note that, with the same selection effects, for both\nchoices of fN , our model prefers smaller values of \u039b than\ndoes the string landscape model with a uniform prior.\nIn both cases, the observed value of \u039b, \u039bobs , is well\nwithin the 95% confidence limit. In case I with a powerlaw fN (N ), \u039b = \u039bobs is just outside the 68% confidence\nlimit, whereas with fN \u221d exp(\u22123N ), it is just inside\nthis limit. Thus, whichever form fN (N ) takes, the observed value of \u039b is typical within our model. Note again\nthat this conclusion is independent of the precise form of\nfN (N ), and totally independent of the prior weighting of\ndifferent values of \u03bb.\n3.\n\nThe Coincidence Problem\n\nTo address the coincidence problem directly we can\ncalculate\u221athe probability that the cosmological timescale\nt\u039b = 1/ \u039b introduced by the CC correlates with the\ncurrent age of the universe, tU \u2248 13.77 Gyrs. We define\nr = | ln(tU /t\u039b )|, and take, fairly arbitrarily, r to be our\nmeasure of the coincidence in the values of t\u039b and tU .\nIf r \u226a 1 there is a strong coincidence in the two times,\nwhereas if r \u226b 1 there is not. Using fposterior (\u039b) as provided by our model, we calculate probabilities of living in\nan observable universe where, at a time tU = 13.77 Gyrs,\nr < r0 for different choices of r0 . We find:\nP (r = | ln(tU /t\u039b )| < 21 ) = 14%,\nP (r < 1) = 36%,\nP (r < 21 ) = 22%,\nP (r < 1) = 53%,\n\n(33)\n(fN = c(N )),\n(34)\n(fN = c(N )e\n\n\u22123N\n\n),\n\nwhere in both c(N ) cases, | d ln c/ d ln \u039b| . 10. It is clear\nfrom these figures that within our model, a coincidence\nin the values of tU and t\u039b is quite typical. If we were\nto do the same calculation for the landscape model with\nuniform prior on \u039b, we would find 7.0% and 19.7% respectively for P (r < 1/2) and P (r < 1). Thus, even if\nwe have uniform prior on \u039b, the probability of tU and\nt\u039b coinciding to within a given factor is smaller in the\nlandscape model than in our proposal.\nAn alternative quantitative statement of the coincidence problem is the probability of observing O0 <\n\u03a9\u039b0 < 1 \u2212 O0 for some O0 , e.g. for O0 = 0.1 and\nO0 = 0.05, we find:\nP (\u03a9\u039b0\nP (\u03a9\u039b0\nP (\u03a9\u039b0\nP (\u03a9\u039b0\n\n\u2208 (0.10, 0.90))\n\u2208 (0.05, 0.95))\n\u2208 (0.10, 0.90))\n\u2208 (0.05, 0.95))\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n23%,\n31%,\n35%,\n47%,\n\n(35)\n(fN = c(N )),\n(fN = c(N )e\n\n(36)\n).\n\n\u22123N\n\nAgain, the observation of a cosmic coincidence in the\nvalues of t\u039b and tU is not atypical in our model or in the\nstring landscape model with uniform prior. However, it is\nsignificantly more likely in the model we have proposed,\nand our model is independent of the choice of prior for\n\u039b.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS AND POSSIBLE\nQUESTIONS\n\nThe cosmological constant problem and the related coincidence problem are two of the most important unsolved problems in cosmology, and are also of importance\nfor high-energy physics and the search for a complete\ntheory of quantum gravity. So far, cosmologists have\nonly been able to describe the effects of the cosmological constant by introducing an arbitrary \u039b term chosen\nto have the observed value (\u039bobs ), or to model it by a\nscalar field that evolves so slowly that its (dark) energy\ndensity is 'almost' a cosmological constant at late times\n(as in quintessence models). It is known that the existence of galaxies, which one may take as a pre-requisite\nfor atom-based observers such as ourselves, would not\nbe possible if \u039b & 103 \u039bobs . In the context of a multiverse of different universes, each with a different \u039b, using the anthropic upper limit \u039b . 103 \u039bobs to explain\nthe observed \u039b depends heavily on the prior likelihood\nof finding different values of \u039b in the multiverse. This\nprior, fprior (\u039b) d\u039b, is the fraction of all universes with\na CC in the region [\u039b, \u039b + d\u039b]. If, for \u039b . 103 \u039bobs ,\nwe have fprior (\u039b) \u2248 const, then the observed value of\n\u039b is not atypical in universes compatible with the anthropic limit. Other plausible forms for the prior include a uniform prior in log-space, fprior \u221d 1/\u039b, or the\nform fprior \u221d exp(3\u03c0/G\u039b). In either case, non-zero\nvalues of \u039b would be greatly disfavoured and the observed value of \u039b highly unnatural. However, until it is\nclear that a uniform prior is (at least approximately) the\nform of fprior predicted by fundamental theory, the multiverse/anthropic explanation of \u039b remains incomplete.\nEven if it is correct, the multiverse explanation has not\nso far made any testable predictions.\nWe have presented a new proposal for solving the cosmological constant and coincidence problems. Crucially,\nin contrast to the multiverse explanation, our proposal\nmakes a falsifiable prediction. The essence of our new\napproach is that the bare cosmological constant \u03bb is promoted from a parameter to a field. The minimisation\nof the action with respect to \u03bb then yields an additional\nfield equation, Eq. (1) which determines the value of the\neffective CC, \u039b, in the classical history that dominates\n\n\f23\nthe partition (wave) function of the universe, Z. Our\nproposal is agnostic about the theory of gravity and the\nnumber of space-time dimensions.\nIn the sense that the cosmological constant is promoted\nto a field, there is a superficial similarity between our\nproposal and quintessence models. In the latter, the effective cosmological constant depends on a scalar field,\n\u03c6(x\u03bc ), and the variation of the action with respect to \u03c6\ngives a local second-order differential equation which determines the dynamics of \u03c6 up to a specification of two\nfree functions of initial data. In our proposal, the different values of \u03bb are summed over in the partition function\nof the universe, and hence \u03bb is a field rather than parameter, but it is not a local scalar field. Whereas a\nscalar field, \u03c6(x\u03bc ), may take a different value at every\npoint in space-time, \u03bb is the same at all points in a given\nclassical history. Hence, the additional field equation obtained from the variation of the action with respect to \u03bb\nis not, as in quintessence theories, a local second-order\ndifferential equation in \u03bb (ie \u03c6), but is instead an integral\nequation, Eq. (3), where the domain of integration is the\nsame as for the action in the partition function, and is\nalgebraic in \u03bb. This algebraic property means that there\nare no initial or boundary data for \u03bb to specify (unlike in\nthe quintessence case) and our method makes a unique\nprediction for the value of \u03bb in terms of the universal\nconfiguration of gravitational and matter fields.\nA specific application of our proposal generically results in a testable prediction. We have taken the action\nin the wave / partition function, Z, of the universe to be\ndefined on some manifold M. A choice of definition for\nM (e.g. the causal past of the observer) is required for\na specific application of our proposal. Different choices\nwill result in different predictions for the effective CC,\n\u039b. With a given M, the equation for \u03bb, Eq. (1) can\nbe viewed as a consistency equation which relates the\nconfiguration of metric and matter variables in M to \u03bb.\nEq. (1) can be viewed as a consistency condition on\nthe configuration of the effective CC, \u039b, the matter, \u03a8a ,\nand metric, g\u03bc\u03bd , fields in M. The consistency condition\nprovided by Eq. (1) will be violated for the vast majority of potential configurations {g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a8a , \u039b} (even if one\ndemands that g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a8a obey their respective field equations). If observations determine a set of {g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a8a , \u039b}\nfor which Eq. (1) is violated then our proposal would\nbe falsified. At the same time, if the observed configuration is consistent with Eq. (3) to within observational\nlimits, then our proposal would, for the time being, have\npassed an important empirical test and remain a credible solution to the CC problems. In addition, if one has\nmeasured \u039b but not (or at least not fully), the {g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a8a } ,\nthen Eq. (1) would require that a certain functional of\nthe undetermined {g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a8a } vanishes. This would represent a prediction of our model which could be tested and\nfalsified by subsequent observations.\nIn \u00a7II we formally described our proposal in its most\ngeneral form. In \u00a7III, we considered in detail the specific\nand simple case where M is taken to be the causal past\n\nof the observer. With this choice of M, the partition\nfunction, Z[M], and \u039b equation, only depend on those\nparts of the universe to which the observer is causally\nconnected. For a given observer, this choice of M is\nwell-defined in a coordinate invariant fashion. Using this\nchoice, we found that Eq. (3) for \u039b reduces to a simple\nform which, keeping only the dominant terms, requires a\nbalance between the spatial curvature and the contribution of baryonic matter to the matter Lagrangian density,\nLmatter . We defined Lmatter = \u2212\u03b6b \u03c1baryon where \u03c1baryon\nis the density of baryonic matter and \u03b6b is a constant\nwhose value can in principle be calculated from QCD. Using an approximate analytical model for baryon structure\n(the chiral bag model), we estimated \u03b6b \u2248 1/2. Given the\ncomplexity of modelling baryon structure, we conservatively estimate that \u03b6b = 1/2 only to within \u00b130% or\nso.\nWe found that Eq. (3) is consistent with the current observable limits on \u039b, the spatial curvature, and\nother observable properties of our universe. If this application of our theory is correct, then the spatial curvature of our universe must take a particular value. This\nvalue depends on \u03a9\u039b0 = \u039b/3H02, and the matter and\nbaryon energy per photon, \u03be and \u03beb respectively as well\nas the time at which observation take place which can\nbe parametrized, for instance by the age of the universe,\ntU or the CMB temperature, TCMB . Taking values of\n\u03a9\u039b0 = 0.73, \u03be = 3.43 eV and \u03beb = 0.54 eV (consistent\nwith observations), we found that the observed dimensionless spatial curvature must be:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b6b\n\u03a9k0 = \u22120.0056\n.\n1/2\nFor reasonable values of \u03b6b \u223c 1/2, this is within the current 68% confidence limit \u03a9k0 = \u22120.0023+0.0054\n\u22120.0056 from\nthe combination of WMAP7 CMB data, with BAO and\nH0 measurements. Additionally, the predicted value of\n\u03a9k0 should be easily confirmed or ruled out by future\nmeasurements of the CMB, H0 and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). For example, a combination of Planck\nCMB data with the WFMOS BAO has been estimated\nto be able to determine \u03a9k0 to a 1-\u03c3 accuracy of about\n1.76 \u00d7 10\u22123 [47]. With the addition of BAO data from\nthe Square Kilometre Array (SKA) or something similar,\nthe accuracy could be increased to 5.64 \u00d7 10\u22124 at 68%\nconfidence [47]. This would be more than sufficient to\nrule out an \u03a9k0 at the predicted level whatever the precise value of \u03b6b . This could conclusively test our model as\nan explanation of the CC problems in the real universe.\nFor the time being, our model is consistent with current observations. We also considered the extent to which\nthe observed value of \u039b is typical within our model, and\nhence whether or not our model can truly be said to\nsolve the CC problems. We found that in our theory\nthe probability of living in a region of the universe where\none observes a given value of \u039b was independent of the\nfundamental prior weighting on different values of \u039b: instead, it was completely determined by the probability\n\n\f24\ndistribution of the number of e-folds of inflation in the\nearly universe, fN (N ). Larger values of \u039b require smaller\nk and hence more e-folds of inflation. However, the difference in the value of N required for \u039b = 0 and a CC\non the edge of the anthropic upper limit (\u039b \u223c 103 \u039bobs )\nis only \u2206N . 1.2. At the same time, for a single value of\n\u039b to dominate the partition function, and hence for the\nuniverse to behave classically, one requires a fairly small\ncurvature and hence N & 50 \u2212 62 (depending on the efficiency of reheating). Thus, the anthropically allowed\nrange of values of \u039b correspond to a range of e-folds with\nN \u2208 [N\u0304 , N\u0304 + \u2206N ], where \u2206N/N\u0304 \u226a 1. This means that\nthe dependence of the posterior probability distribution\nfor \u039b depends only fairly weakly on fN (N ).\nUnless there is a strong (exponential) preference for\na value of N\u0304 + \u2206N over N\u0304 (which would increase the\npreference for larger \u039b) we found that the observed value\nof \u039b is indeed typical within our model. Specifically, the\nobserved value, \u039bobs , lies close (either just inside or just\noutside depending on fN ) the symmetric 1-\u03c3 confidence\ninterval for \u039b. We also found that the probability of\nus observing the cosmological coincidence between the\nvalue of t\u039b and the age of the universe is relatively high\n(14 \u2212 53% depending on how one quantifies what counts\nas a coincidence).\nOur proposal for solving the CC is similar in certain\nrespects to other multiverse models such as the string\nlandscape, when \u039b takes different values in different\nvacua/parts of the multiverse. Despite this similarity,\nit differs from multiverse / landscape models in three\ncrucial respects:\n(1) Our model is, unlike multiverse models, independent of the fundamental prior weighting on different values of \u039b;\n(2) The preference for small \u039b is our model does not\ncome wholly from anthropic selection effects as it does\nin multiverse models. Roughly, the prior probability\nfor different values of \u039b is uniform for \u039b . O(few)\u039bobs\nand approximately uniform in log-space for larger values.\nThis means that the probability of observing a value of\n\u039b \u223c O(\u039bobs ) is typically higher in our model by a factor\nof 2 \u2212 5;\n(3) Our model makes a testable prediction for \u03a9k0 that\ncan be falsified by upcoming CMB/BAO surveys.\nWe now address some possible questions about our proposal:\n1. \"What is the equation of state of dark energy in this\nmodel?\": The equation of state is exactly w = \u22121\ni.e. a pure cosmological constant / vacuum energy.\nProvided that Eq. (3) has a solution, observers see\na classical history with a single constant value of the\neffective CC \u039b (as determined by Eq. (3)). Since\nthe \u039b is observed to be constant, it has an effective\npressure, P\u039b , equal in magnitude but opposite in\nsign to its effective energy density, \u03c1\u039b = \u03ba\u22121 \u039b and\nhence w \u2261 P\u039b /\u03c1\u039b = \u22121.\n\n2. \"Does the observed effective CC depend the time of\nobservation?\": Yes (but see Q. 3). In \u00a7III, we the\nmanifold, M, on which the action was defined to\nbe the causal past of the observer, which clearly depends on the time (and position) of the observer.\nThe observed \u039b depends on M and \u2202M through\nEq. (3) and hence also depends on the observation time. Crucially, however, \u039b is not seen to\nevolve. The classical history that dominates the\nwave function, Z[M], has a single constant value\nof \u039b throughout the observer's past, M. Thus\nall observations are consistent with a single constant \u039b as given by Eq. (3). The observation time\nchanges, so does the classical history that dominants the parition function. Observers at slightly\ndifferent times would see slightly different classical\nhistories respectively consistent with slightly different values of \u039b. In this way, our proposal is quite\nunlike the 'ever-present lambda' models [48] where\n\u039b arises as a random space-time fluctuation and\nis always inversely proportional to the square root\nof the space-time 4-volume, so \u039b \u2248 Gt\u22122 at time\nt. Everpresent-\u039b models have severe observational\nproblems [49] and furthermore are only consistent\nwith \u039b \u223c 1/t2U in 3 + 1 dimensions (in D+1 space\u2212(D+1)/2\ntime dimensions \u039b \u223c tU\nin natural units).\n3. \"Can observers at different times establish that they\nmeasure different values of \u039b?\": No (at least not\nclassically). Different values of \u039b correspond to different classical histories. For an observer at one\ntime to communicate the value of \u039b that they measure to another observer (or even the same observer) at a later time, and hence reveal that the\ntwo values are different, they would have to find a\nway of sending information from one classical history to another. At the classical level (at least) this\nis not possible. Classically, an observer will see only\na history consistent with the value of \u039b, equal to\n\u039b\u22c6 say, for their observation time. This would include seeing reports of / remembering all previous\nmeasurements of \u039b as giving \u039b = \u039b\u22c6 .\n4. \"How does \u039b change with observation time for the\nmodel presented in \u00a7III?\": It decreases as the observation time increases. As the observation time,\nto increases, the value of the spatial curvature k\nthat is required (i.e. k0 (\u039b, to )) for a given value of\n\u039b decreases i.e. k0 (\u039b, t1 ) > k0 (\u039b, t2 > t1 ), so at\nfixed \u039b, \u2202k0 /\u2202to |\u039b < 0. We found that at fixed\nt, \u2202k0 /\u2202\u039b|t < 0. For a given observer, k is fixed.\nThus, defining the observed CC at to to be \u039b(to ),\nwe must have:\ndk0 (\u039b(to ), to )\nd\u039b(to ) \u2202k0\n\u2202k0\n=0=\n.\n+\ndto\ndto \u2202\u039b\n\u2202to\nIt follows that d\u039b(to )/ dto < 0. This also means\nthat at some point in the future, k will be too large\n\n\f25\nfor Eq. (3) to admit a classical solution. The universe would then cease to have a dominant classical\nhistory. One could view this as in some sense the\nend of the classical universe.\n5. \"Does this proposal require the existence of a multiverse / landscape?\": No, not in the sense of an ensemble of \"parallel\" universes with different physical constants. However our model does not exclude it either. Our model does require that the\nspatial curvature is different for different causally\ndisconnected observers, a scenario that is naturally\nrealized in the context of inflationary theory. Different bubbles of space-time will undergo different\namounts of inflation and hence have a different spatial curvature at the same time, however these different bubble universes are all part of the same universe in the sense that a hypothetical tachyonic astronaut could in principle travel between them.\n6. \"What role does inflation play in this model?\": Inflation in important in this model in two related\nways. Firstly, it makes the spatial curvature a spatially varying quantity which is different in different\nsuper-horizon-sized regions, and dependent on the\nnumber of e-folds of inflation that took place in\neach causally connected part of the universe. Provided the whole universe (not just the part we see)\nis large enough (or infinite) the values of k required\nfor a classical history to dominate the wave function in our model will occur at least somewhere.\nIt seems reasonable to assume that this classicality is a prerequisite for the existence of observers\nsuch as ourselves. Provided this is the case, it is\nimmediately clear that we could only ever live in\nthose parts of the universe where the number of efolds N, and the hence spatial curvature k, lies in\nthe small range we reviewed where classical solutions exist and anthropic upper-bounds on \u039b hold.\nSecondly, in our model the prior probability (i.e.\nprior to the inclusion of the anthropic bounds) of\nobserving a CC in [\u039b, \u039b + d\u039b] is related the probability of a given spatial curvature and hence to the\nprobability of a given number of e-folds of inflation.\n\nthe case for a different choice of M, and find another application consistent with observations but\nthis is not something we have investigated at this\ntime. Certainly the choices we made for the particular application of our proposal in \u00a7III seem to be\nthe most simple and natural. The only wiggle room\nis if the QCD parameter \u03b6b is significantly different from 0.5, but the required value would then be\ndetermined by observations and could be checked\nagainst a detailed QCD calculation of \u03b6b .\nIn summary: we have introduced a new approach to\nsolving the cosmological constant and coincidence problems. The bare CC, \u03bb, or equivalently the minimum of\nthe vacuum energy, is allowed to take many possible values in the wave function, Z, of the universe. The value of\nthe effective CC in the classical history that dominates\nZ is given by a new integral field equation, Eq. (1). Our\nscheme is agnostic about the theory of gravity and the\nnumber of space-time dimensions. We have applied it\nin its simplest and most natural form to a universe in\nwhich gravity is described by GR. The observed classical\nhistory will be completely consistent with a non-evolving\ncosmological constant. In an homogeneous and isotropic\nmodel of the universe with realistic matter content we\nfind that the observed value of the\n\u221a effective CC is typical, as is a coincidence between 1/ \u039b and the present age\nof the universe, tU . Unlike explanations of the CC problem that rely only on Bayesian selection in a multiverse,\nour model in independent of the unknown prior weighting of different \u039b values, and makes a specific numerical prediction for the observed spatial curvature parameter. Specifically, we should observe \u03a9k0 = \u22120.0056(2\u03b6b),\nwhere the QCD bag parameter is \u03b6b \u2243 0.5. This prediction is consistent with current observations but can\nbe tested by Planck/BAO observations in the very near\nfuture. In conclusion, we have described a new type of\nsolution of the cosmological constant problems. It is consistent with observation and free of fine-tunings, requires\nno new forms of dark energy or modifications to the lowenergy theory of gravity, and is subject to high-precision\ntest by future observations.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\n7. \"If future observations rule out the predicted value\nof \u03a9k0 does this rule out this proposal?\": Yes, the\napplication of our scheme given in \u00a7III where we\ntake M to the observer's causal past would be conclusively ruled out. It may be that one could argue\n\nWe would like to thank A-C. Davis, R. Brandenberger,\nPh. Brax, G. Efstathiou and R. Tavakol for helpful discussions and comments. DJS acknowledges STFC.\n\n[1] A.

Hence\nthe wave-function (partition function) of the universe is\na super-position of all possible values of \u03bb. This concept\nis not new, and it has been seen to arise naturally in\nthe study of unimodular gravity (see Refs. [33, 46] and\nreferences therein).\n1.\n\nUnimodular Gravity\n\nClassically, the field equations of unimodular gravity\nare equivalent to those of general relativity but with the\ncosmological constant undetermined. Unimodular gravity was first formulated in a non-covariant fashion in\nterms of the usual Einstein-Hilbert action for GR (and\nminimally coupled matter action) but with the degrees of\nfreedom\nin the metric, g\u03bc\u03bd , restricted by the constraint\n\u221a\n\u2212g = 1. The total action is the unmodified and, dropping surface terms, for some \u03bb is given by:\nZ\nZ\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1\n1\nItot =\nR(g) \u2212g d4 x \u2212\n\u03bb \u2212g d4 x\n2\u03ba M\n\u03ba M\nZ\n\u221a\n+\n\u2212g d4 x Lmatter .\nM\n\n\u221a\nSince \u2212g the second term on the right-hand side (the\nbare CC term) is just a constant and so does not contribute to the field equations found by requiring \u03b4Itot = 0.\nVarying this action with respect to the unit modulus metric, g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd = (\u2212g)\u22121/4 g\u03bc\u03bd , gives the trace-free part of the\nusual Einstein equation:\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n1\n\u03bc\u03bd\nR\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 Rg \u03bc\u03bd = \u03ba Tmatter\n\u2212 g \u03bc\u03bd Tmatter .\n4\n4\n\u03bc\u03bd\nUsing \u2207\u03bc Tmatter\n= 0 and \u2207\u03bc R\u03bc\u03bd = \u2207\u03bd R/2 we have\n\n\u2207\u03bc (R + \u03baTmatter) = 0 \u2192 R = \u2212\u03baTmatter + 4\u039b,\n\nwhere \u039b = const is a constant of integration. Using the\nabove equation, we then recover the usual Einstein equation with effective cosmological constant \u039b:\n1\n\u03bc\u03bd\nR\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 Rg \u03bc\u03bd = \u03baTmatter\n\u2212 \u039bg \u03bc\u03bd .\n2\n\n\f27\nIn this formulation of unimodular gravity, there is no connection between the effective CC, \u039b, and either the bare\ncosmological constant\n\u03bb or the vacuum energy from mat\u221a\nter \u03c1vac . Since \u2212g = 1, it follows that in unimodular\ngravity the 4-volume, VM , of M is fixed where:\nZ\n\u221a\nVM =\n\u2212g d4 x.\nM\n\nFixed VM is usually taken to be the defining feature of\nunimodular gravity.\nSince \u039b can take any possible value, the partition/wave\nfunction of the universe in unimodular gravity includes a\nsum over all values of \u039b with some unspecified weighting\n\u03bc[\u039b]:\nZ\nZuni = \u03bc[\u039b] d\u039bDg\u03bc\u03bd D\u03a8a eiItot .\nOther than the unspecified weight function, \u03bc[\u039b], another issue with the original formulation\nof unimodular\n\u221a\ngravity is that the constraint \u2212g = 1 is not diffeomorphism invariant. Henneaux and Teitelboim [33] found\nan action for unimodular gravity that is both diffeomorphism invariant and has the shift symmetry under\n\u039b \u2192 \u039b + const which fixes \u03bc[\u039b] = const.\nThe Henneaux-Teitelboim action is\nZ\n\u0001\n\u221a\n1\nIHT \u2261 Igrav + Im \u2212\n\u03bb \u2212g \u2212 \u2202\u03bc \u1e7d \u03bc d4 x,\n\u03ba M\n\nwhere Igrav is the Einstein-Hilbert action for gravity plus\nsurface terms, Im is the matter action including the contribution from the vacuum energy; \u1e7d \u03bc is a vector-density\n\u03bc\nfield\n\u221a and \u03bb = \u03bb(x ) is a scalar field. In this formulation\n\u2212g is not fixed a priori. However, varying\nthe action\n\u221a\nwith respect to the scalar field \u03bb gives \u2212g \u2261 \u2202\u03bc \u1e7d \u03bc . It\nfollows that there is a shift symmetry under \u03bb \u2192 \u03bb + \u03b4\u03bb\nfor constant \u03b4\u03bb\nZ\n\u0001\n\u221a\n\u03b4\u03bb\nIHT \u2192 IHT \u2212\n\u2212g \u2212 \u2202\u03bc \u1e7d \u03bc = IHT ,\n\u03ba M\n\u221a\nwhere the last equality comes from \u2212g = \u2207\u03bc \u1e7d \u03bc . Vary\u03bc\ning the action with respect to \u1e7d gives:\nZ\n1\n\u03b4IHT =\n[\u1e7d \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03bb + \u2202\u03bc (\u03bb\u03b4\u1e7d \u03bc )] .\n\u03ba M\nFor the \u2202\u03bc (\u03bb\u03b4\u1e7d \u03bc ) term to vanish, we must have \u03b4\u1e7d \u03bc n\u03bc = 0\non \u2202M, where \u2202M corresponds to f (x\u03bc ) = 0 and n\u03bc \u221d\n\u2207\u03bc f . With \u03b4\u1e7d \u03bc so fixed on \u2202M, \u03b4IHT /\u03b4\u1e7d \u03bc = 0 gives\n\u2202\u03bc \u03bb = 0 \u21d2 \u03bb = const,\nand so \u03bb, which represents the bare cosmological constant, is an arbitrary space-time constant. Varying the\naction with respect to g\u03bc\u03bd and requiring that any surface\nintegrals vanish on \u2202M, gives\n1\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\nR\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 Rg \u03bc\u03bd = \u03baTm\n\u2212 \u03bbg \u03bc\u03bd = \u03baTmatter\n\u2212 \u039bg \u03bc\u03bd ,\n2\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\nwhere Tm\n= Tmatter\n\u039b = \u03bb + \u03ba\u03c1vac is the\n\u221a\u2212 \u03c1vac g and\neffective CC. Since \u2212g = \u2202\u03bc \u1e7d \u03bc , requiring n\u03bc \u03b4\u1e7d \u03bc = 0\nfixes the four-volume, VM , and ensures that the HT action really does describe a unimodular theory of gravity:\nZ\nZ\n\u221a\nd4 x \u2212g =\nVM =\nd4 x \u2202\u03bc \u1e7d \u03bc ,\nM\nZM\n4\n\u03bc\n\u03b4VM =\nd x \u2202\u03bc \u03b4\u1e7d = 0.\nM\n\nThe partition function for the HT unimodular action is:\nZ\nZHT = D\u03bbD\u1e7d \u03bc Dg\u03bc\u03bd D\u03a8a \u03bc[\u039b]eiIHT ,\nwhere the sum over configurations is for \u1e7d \u03bc normal to\n\u2202M and the matter and metric variables are fixed on the\nboundary.\n\n2.\n\nAn Alternative Formulation of Our Model\n\nNow, with Itot = Igrav + Im + ICC [\u03bb, g\u03bc\u03bd ; M], we define\nwe have IHT = Itot + Iv [\u03bb, \u1e7d \u03bc ; M] where\nZ\nZ\n1\nIv =\nd4 x \u1e7d \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03bb\n(A1)\n\u03bb\u2202\u03bc \u1e7d \u03bc = \u2212\n\u03ba M\nM\nZ\n1\n\u2202\u03bc (\u03bb\u1e7d \u03bc ) ,\n+\n\u03ba M\n= I\u03b4 + Iv\u2212surf ,\nZ\nZ\n1\nd4 x \u1e7d \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03bb,\nIv\u2212surf =\nI\u03b4 = \u2212\n\u2202\u03bc (\u03bb\u1e7d \u03bc ) .\n\u03ba\nM\nM\nHere, Iv\u2212surf is a total derivative and so represents a\nsurface term in the action and I\u03b4 has the property that\nZ\nD\u1e7d \u03bc eiI\u03b4 \u221d \u03b4[\u2202\u03bc \u03bb],\nwhere \u03b4[\u2202\u03bc \u03bb] is a functional \u03b4-function peaked about\nspace-time constant configurations of \u03bb, and so acts as\nZ\nZ \u221e\nD\u03bb \u03b4[\u2202\u03bc \u03bb]A[\u03bb, . . . ] =\nd\u03bb A[\u03bb, . . . ].\n\u2212\u221e\n\nIt follows that the partition function in our proposal can\nbe rewritten (up to an arbitrary and irrelevant overall\nconstant) as\nZ\n(A2)\nZ[M] =\nd\u03bbDg\u03bc\u03bd D\u03a8a \u03bc[\u039b]eiItot\nZ\nZ\n=\nD\u03bb \u03b4[\u2202\u03bc \u03bb] Dg\u03bc\u03bd D\u03a8a \u03bc[\u039b]eiItot ,\nZ\n=\nD\u03bbD\u1e7d \u03bc Dg\u03bc\u03bd D\u03a8a \u03bc[\u039b]ei(Itot +I\u03b4 =IHT \u2212Iv\u2212surf ) ,\nwhere in our proposal\nthe sum over configurations is for\n\b\nsome fixed set QA of the metric and matter variables\n\n\f28\nfixed on the boundary; \u1e7d \u03bc is just a Lagrange multiplier\nfield here and so is not assumed to be fixed anywhere.\nIt is clear from the second line of Ref. (A2) that there is\nan aesthetic similarity between the partition function in\nour proposal and that in the HT formulation of unimodular gravity. Both theories can be formulated in terms\nof a scalar field \u03bb(x\u03bc ) and vector-density \u1e7d \u03bc in addition\nto the usual metric and matter fields. When written in\nthis way, the action in our proposal is Itot + I\u03b4 with differs from the action in the HT proposal by a surface term\nIv\u2212surf . The two formulations also differ in terms of what\nis taken to be fixed on the boundary, with the main difference being that in HT unimodular gravity, \u1e7d \u03bc is fixed\nnormal to \u2202M, which in turn fixes the 4-volume, VM , of\nM. In our formulation the addition of the subtraction\nof the surface term Iv\u2212surf relative to IHT , means that\none no longer needs to require \u03b4\u1e7d \u03bc n\u03bc = 0 on \u2202M, and\nhence the VM is not fixed in our proposal and it is not a\nunimodular gravity theory, despite its similarities to the\nHT theory.\nVarying the action in our model, produces terms proportional to \u03b4\u03bb.

The classical field\nequations for g\u03bc\u03bd and \u03a8a are then E \u03bc\u03bd = \u03a6a = 0 and\nthese cause the variation of Ifull with respect to g\u03bc\u03bd and\n\u03a8a to vanish in the bulk (i.e. in M). Similarly, requiring\n\u03b4Ifull = 0 with respect to variations of \u03bb and \u1e7d \u03bc in the\nbulk gives:\n\u221a\n\u2212g = \u2202\u03bc \u1e7d \u03bc ,\n\n\u2202\u03bc \u03bb = 0.\n\nWhen these field equations hold in the bulk, \u03b4Ifull reduces\nto surface integrals over \u2202M. Since \u2202\u03bc \u03bb = 0, the allowed\nvariations of \u03bb are those for which \u03b4\u03bb is a space-time\nconstant.

Indeed fixing \u03b3\u03bc\u03bd and \u03a8a on\n\u2202M would, modulo the field equations, generally fix \u03bb\nand set \u03b4\u03bb = 0. However, fixing \u03bb in M returns us to\nthe usual action of general relativity where the bare CC\nis some fixed external parameter. Thus, to preserve the\nnature of \u03bb as a configuration variable that is integrated\nover the partition function, we cannot take either \u03b4\u03bb = 0\nor \u03b4\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b4\u03a8a = 0 (for all \u03bb).\nIn our scheme for solving the CC problems, we propose\nmaking a different ansatz: \u03b4\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd = H\u03bc\u03bd \u03b4\u03bb and \u03b4\u03a8a =\nP a \u03b4\u03bb where the form of H\u03bc\u03bd and P a must be consistent\nwith the classical field equations. This is equivalent to\nfixing \u03b3\u03bc\u03bd and P a only for each value of \u03bb rather than\nfor all \u03bb. Then, we have\n\u0012Z\n\u0003\n\u221a 3 \u0002 \u22121 \u03bc\u03bd\n\u03b4Ifull = \u03b4\u03bb\n\u03b3 d x \u03ba N H\u03bc\u03bd + \u03a3a P a\n\u2202M\n\u0013\nZ\n\u22121\n\u2212\u03ba\nd3 x f\u03bc \u1e7d \u03bc ,\n\u2202M\n\nand so we can have classical solutions where \u03b4Ifull = 0\nwithout having to externally fix \u03bb (i.e. set \u03b4\u03bb = 0).\nQuantum mechanically, \u03bb can take all possible values and\nthe partition/wave function is a super-position over histories with all possible values of \u03bb. Classically, the dominant history is the one where the value of \u03bb is such that\n\u03b4Ifull = 0 i.e.:\nZ\nZ\n\u0003\n1\n\u221a 3 \u0002 \u22121 \u03bc\u03bd\na\n=\n\u03b3 d x \u03ba N H\u03bc\u03bd + \u03a3a P\nd3 x f\u03bc \u1e7d \u03bc\n\u03ba \u2202M\n\u2202M\nZ\n\u221a\n1\n=\n\u2212g d4 x.\n\u03ba M\nIn \u00a7II B, we showed that equation of \u039b in our theory is\nentirely equivalent to\ndIclass\n= 0,\nd\u03bb\nwhere Iclass is the value of Itot when the classical field\nequations hold for the matter and the metric.\nSince \u03bb only ever appears in the other field equations in\nthe combination \u03bb+ \u03ba\u03c1vac = \u039b, this is a field equation for\nthe effective CC, \u039b. We note that by introducing the Lagrange multiplier field \u1e7d \u03bc , this field equation is equivalent\nto the vanishing of a surface-integral over the boundary\n\u2202M. In this sense, it can be said to be holographic.\n3.\n\nSummary\n\nIn this appendix, we have seen that our proposal\ncan alternatively be formulated in terms of the action\nIfull = Itot + I\u03b4 and an ansatz about how the boundary\n\n\f29\nmetric and matter fields depend on \u039b which is required\nto preserve the freedom to vary the bare cosmological\nconstant \u03bb.\nWe noted that Ifull is almost equivalent to the\nHenneaux-Teitelboim action, IHT for unimodular gravity\nwith the only difference between a surface term, Iv\u2212surf .\nDespite this similarity, the subtraction of Iv\u2212surf from\nIHT to Ifull greatly alters the properties of the theory as\nin our model one does not need to fix the four-volume,\nVM , whereas in the HT model, as a unimodular gravity\ntheory, VM must be held fixed to return the usual classical field equations. Both unimodular gravity and our\nproposal feature a sum over all possible values of the bare\nCC, \u03bb, in the partition function. This sum includes an\nunspecified weight, or prior, on \u039b: \u03bc[\u039b]. In unimodular gravity there is no accompanying classical field equation for \u03bb and so it remains completely unspecified. The\nweighting \u03bc[\u039b] then plays an important role in determining the relative contributions of different values of \u03bb to\nthe partition function. In our model, the subtraction of a\nsurface term from the unimodular action, combined with\nthe ansatz about the dependence of boundary quantities\non \u03bb, provides a field equation which determines the classical value of the effective CC. The partition function is\nstrongly peaked about the value of \u03bb for which this field\nequation holds. In this classical limit, only this value\nof \u03bb contributes to the partition function and \u03bc[\u039b] simply becomes an irrelevant overall constant multiplying\nthe partition function. Its form is no longer important.\nPhysics in our model is independent of the prior weighting function \u03bc[\u039b] to an excellent approximation whereas\nin unimodular gravity it is not. We also saw that the\n\u039b equation in our model can be written in a holographic\nfashion, as the vanishing of an integral over the boundary\n\u2202M.\n\nAppendix B: Surfaces Terms in General Relativity\n\nIn this appendix we rederive, for completeness, the\nform of the surface terms which must be added to the\nusual Einstein-Hilbert action, IEH , to make it first order\nin derivatives of the metric. The need for these boundary\nterms was first realized by York [35], and then rediscovered and refined by Gibbons and Hawking [36]. York,\nand then Gibbons and Hawking, explicitly derived the\nform of the required surface term for a non-null boundary. The equivalent surface terms for null boundaries\nfollow from a double null decomposition of the Einstein\nfield equations, see Refs. [37, 38], although this has\nrarely been explicitly stated. We detail the derivation of\nthe Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) surface terms, IGHY ,\nfor a 'cosmological' boundary defined to be the union of\nthe surface of past-light cone of a given observer, \u2202Mu\nboundary and some initial hypersurface \u2202MI with timelike normal. For this setting, we explicitly state how the\nvariation of Igrav = IEH + IGHY depends on the metric\non the boundary. We also restate the definition of York's\n\ncosmological surface term, IYC , defined in Ref. [35], since\nthis is relevant for boundaries such as the initial singularity.\nWe take M to be the manifold where u(x\u03bc ) < 0 and\n0 < \u03c4 (x\u03bc ) < \u03c40 for some u(x\u03bc ) and \u03c4 (x\u03bc ). We define\nu(x\u03bc ) = \u03c40 on the past-light of an observer (at \u03c4 = \u03c40 )\nand w(x\u03bc ) to be a null coordinate that lies perpendicular\nto u, defined so that \u03c4 = (u + w)/2; \u03c4 is a timelike\ncoordinate i.e. \u2207\u03bc \u03c4 \u2207\u03bc \u03c4 < 0.\nAn integral over M is equivalent to an integral over\nthe whole space-time weighted by H(\u2212u)H(\u03c4 )H(\u03c40 \u2212 \u03c4 )\nwhere H(y) is the Heaviside function which is unity for\ny > 0 and vanishes for y < 0; dH(y)/ dy = \u03b4(y) where\n\u03b4(y) is the Dirac delta function.\nWe therefore write:\nM = {x\u03bc : H(\u03c40 \u2212 u)H(\u03c4 )H(\u03c40 \u2212 \u03c4 ) > 0} ,\nand \u2202M = \u2202Mu \u222a \u2202MI where \u2202Mu is {u = \u03c40 , 0 < \u03c4 <\n\u03c40 } and \u2202MI is {u < \u03c40 , \u03c4 = 0}. We define u\u03bc = \u2207\u03bc u\nand w\u03bc = \u2207\u03bc w. Now u and w are null coordinates\nso u\u03bc u\u03bc = w\u03bc w\u03bc = 0 and we define u\u03bc w\u03bc = \u22122e\u22122\u03c3 .\nWe also define \u03c4\u03bc = \u2207\u03bc \u03c4 . Since \u03c4 = (u + w)/2 it follows that \u03c4\u03bc \u03c4 \u03bc = \u2212e\u22122\u03c3 . We define m\u03bc = e\u03c3 \u03c4\u03bc so\nthat m\u03bc m\u03bc = \u22121 and then n\u03bc = e\u03c3 u\u03bc . We then have\nm\u03bc n\u03bc = 1. Finally, we define {\u03b8i }, i = 1, 2, to be intrinsic coordinates on the surfaces, S, of constant \u03c4 and\nu. We define ei\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc \u03b8i . The metric g\u03bc\u03bd can then be\ndecomposed thus:\ng\u03bc\u03bd = n\u03bc n\u03bd + 2n(\u03bd m\u03bc) + h\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(B1)\n\nwhere h\u03bc\u03bd n\u03bc = h\u03bc\u03bd m\u03bc = 0.\nThe Einstein-Hilbert action for General Relativity is:\nZ\n\u221a\n1\nIEH =\n\u2212gR(g) d4 x,\n2\u03ba M\nwhere R(g) is the Ricci scalar curvature of g\u03bc\u03bd . This is\nsecond order in derivatives of the metric.\n1.\n\nGHY Surface Term\n\nOn a non-null boundary, the Gibbons-Hawking-York\nsurface term, IGHY , is the surface term that must be\nadded IEH to make IEH + IGHY first order in derivatives\nof the metric. It is natural to extend this definition to null\nboundaries, so that on a general boundary IEH + IGHY\nis first order in derivatives of the metric. We use this\ndefinition to find the form of IGHY for our \u2202M. This\nis more simply and clearly done by writing the metric\nin terms of a vierbein E\u03bcI , I = 1, 2, 3, 4, where g\u03bc\u03bd =\nE\u03bcI E\u03bdJ \u03b7IJ for some fixed \u03b7IJ ; det\u03b7 = \u22121. We choose\na form for \u03b7IJ suited for a decomposition of the metric\nalong a null and a time-like direction:\n!\n!\nI2\u00d72 0\n1 1\n\u03b7IJ =\n,\nN2\u00d72 =\n,\n0 N2\u00d72\n1 0\nI2\u00d72 = diag(1, 1).\n\n\f30\nWe use \u03b7IJ and its inverse \u03b7 IJ to raise and lower indices\nI.\nIt follows from g\u03bc\u03bd = E\u03bcI E\u03bdJ \u03b7IJ that\ng\u03bc\u03bd =\n\nE\u03bc3 E\u03bd3\n\n+\n\n4\n3\nE\u03bd)\n2E(\u03bc\n\n+\n\n2\nX\n\nE\u03bci E\u03bdj .\n\nwhere\nS \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 = \u03c9 \u03bd\u03bc\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c9\u03c3 \u03c3\u03c1 g \u03bc\u03bd + \u03c9\u03c3 \u03c3\u03bc g \u03bd\u03c1 ,\nWe note that S \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 V\u03bc V\u03c1 = 0 for any V\u03bc .\nWe define:\nZ\n\u0002\u221a\n\u0003\n1\nd4 x \u2202\u03c1 \u2212gS \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 2E\u03bdI \u03b4E\u03bcI ,\n\u03b4I (u) + \u03b4I (I) = \u2212\n2\u03ba M\nZ\n\u221a\n\u0003\n\u0002\n1\ne\u03c3 h d\u03c4 d2 \u03b8 n\u03c1 S \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 2E\u03bdI \u03b4E\u03bcI ,\n\u03b4I (u) =\n2\u03ba \u2202Mu\nZ\n\u221a\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\n\u03b4I (I) =\ne\u03c3 h dr d2 \u03b8 m\u03c1 S \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 2E\u03bdI \u03b4E\u03bcI .\n2\u03ba \u2202MI\n\n(B2)\n\ni=1\n\nComparing Eqs. (B1) and (B2), we see that we can take\nE\u03bc3 = n\u03bc , E\u03bc4 = m\u03bc and then h\u03bc\u03bd = E\u03bc1 E\u03bd1 + E\u03bc2 E\u03bd2 . With\nintrinsic coordinates \u0002{\u03b8i } on {u, \u03c4 } = const\nsurfaces, S,\n\u0003\nwe have: E\u03bci = ai j ei\u03bc + K i u\u03bc + \u03b2 j \u03c4\u03bc and let hij =\nP l l\nl a i a j . hij is then the induced 2-metric on S and\nK i and \u03b2 i are shift 2-vectors. We also define a 'radial'\ncoordinate, r, on surfaces of constant \u03c4 by r = (u \u2212 w)/2.\nThus, we have\n\n(u)\n\n(I)\n\nWe now re-express the IGHY , IGHY , \u03b4I (u) and \u03b4I (I) in\na more familiar form in terms of the geometry of the\nboundaries \u2202Mu and \u2202MI . We note that E\u03c1I \u03c9 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 =\n\u2207\u03bc E \u03bdI and so\n\ng\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd = e2\u03c3 du2 \u2212 2e\u03c3 N du d\u03c4 + hij D\u03b8i D\u03b8j ,\nD\u03b8i = d\u03b8i + K i du + \u03b2 i d\u03c4.\n\n\u2212 n\u03c1 \u03c9 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 = \u2212E\u03c13 \u03c9 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 = \u2212\u2207\u03bc n\u03bd ,\n\nNow E \u03bcI is a 4-vector and so\nR(g) = E \u03bd I [\u2207\u03bc , \u2207\u03bd ] E \u03bcI = \u2207\u03bc E \u03bd I \u2207\u03bd E \u03bcI \u2212 E \u03bc I \u2207\u03bd E\n\u0002\n\n+\u2207\u03bc E \u03bc I \u2207\u03bd E \u03bdI \u2212 \u2207\u03bc E \u03bd I \u2207\u03bd E \u03bcI .\n\nWe define \u03c9 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 = \u2212\u03c9 \u03bc\u03c1\u03bd = EI\u03c1 \u2207\u03bc E \u03bdI . In terms of the\nvierbein, we can rewrite IEH in the following form:\nZ\nZ\n\u0002\u221a\n\u0003\n\u221a\n1\n1\n4\nIEH =\n\u2212g d x R(g) = \u2212\n\u2202\u03c1 \u2212g\u03c9\u03bc \u03bc\u03c1\n2\u03ba M\n\u03ba M\nZ\n\u221a\n1\n\u2212g d4 x [\u03c9\u03bd \u03bd\u03c1 \u03c9 \u03bc \u03bc\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c9 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 \u03c9\u03bd\u03bc\u03c1 ] .
