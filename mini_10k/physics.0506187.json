Following recollision, the initial electron\nshares its energy with several bound electrons. We use a classical model based on rapid electron\nthermalization to interpret recent experiments. For neon, good agreement with the available data\nis obtained with an upper bound of 460 attoseconds for the thermalization time.\nPACS numbers:\n\nAtoms exposed to intense laser fields ionize. The freed\nelectron and its ionic partner are accelerated by the laser\nfield away from each other. When the field changes sign,\nit may drive the electron into a recollision with the ion.\nThis simple mechanism, which for high-intensity lowfrequency fields is largely classical, governs many laseratom processes such as high-order harmonic generation\n(HHG), high-order above-threshold ionization (HATI),\nand nonsequential double ionization (NSDI) and explains\nthe gross features of the spectra observed [1].\nThe period of the commonly applied titanium-sapphire\n(Ti:Sa) laser is about 2.7 fs. The recollision physics unfold on the time scale of a small fraction of the laser period. Therefore, the analysis of laser-induced recollision\nphenomena provides access to the inner-atomic dynamics\non the attosecond time scale and, indeed, the focus of recent investigations has moved into this temporal domain.\nFor example, it has brought molecular imaging with subangstrom spatial and subfemtosecond temporal resolution within reach [2, 3]. The advent of phase-stabilized\ninfrared few-cycle pulses and of uv pulses of attosecond\nduration allows even more control [4], but neither are\nnecessary for a study of the attosecond dynamics.\nIn this Letter, we analyze recent experiments on nonsequential multiple ionization (NSMI) of neon [5,6] in which\nthe momentum distributions of NeN + (N = 3, 4) were\nmeasured at two intensities. We use the fact that the\ntime-dependent laser field provides a clock - the field\naccelerates the ion to a final velocity that depends on\nthe times at which the N electrons ionized. This \"streak\ncamera\" [7] therefore measures the range of times of ionization. Comparing the measured momentum distributions to those predicted by a classical model, we infer that\nthe recolliding electron thermalizes with the N \u22121 bound\nelectrons in less than 500 attoseconds. To our knowledge,\nno other method allows such a low upper bound for thermalization times within atoms to be measured.\nNonsequential double and multiple ionization is defined by the fact that it is not sequential, that is, it is\nnot the product of a sequence of uncorrelated single-\n\nionization events. NSDI and NSMI require electronelectron correlation as a necessary precondition [5, 8].\nEven for the very simplest such process \u2013 NSDI of helium\n\u2013 a fully quantum-mechanical description from first principles, i.e. by solution of the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation in six spatial dimensions, has not been accomplished yet [9], and for the heavier atoms it is clearly\nout of the question. This leaves approximate quantummechanical approaches, such as density-functional methods [10], S-matrix methods that try to identify the most\nrelevant terms of an appropriate perturbative expansion\n[11, 12], or classical-trajectory methods [13, 14]. For multiple (triple and higher) ionization, which occurs under\nthe same conditions as NSDI if the laser intensity is high\nenough, any description from first principles appears to\nbe utterly out of reach. It seems equally hopeless, for\nthree electrons and more, to identify the relevant diagrams in the microscopic S-matrix approach.\nThe model we here propose is in the spirit of the one\nof Ref. [12], but essentially classical. We investigate the\nscenario wherein NSMI is effected by one single recollision. We assume that the pertinent electron tunnels into\nthe continuum with zero velocity at the ionization time t\u2032\naccording to the time-dependent rate R(t\u2032 ), for which we\nadopt the standard quasi-static rate [15]. Thereafter, we\nturn to an entirely classical description: The laser field\nmay drive the electron back to its parent ion at a later\ntime t, which is a function t(t\u2032 ) of the ionization time\nand can be easily evaluated. We assume that the energy Eret (t) of the returning electron be completely thermalized among the ensemble of participating electrons,\nthat is, the returning electron and the N \u2212 1 electrons to\nbe freed. These N electrons then form an excited complex with the total energy (with respect to the continuum\n(N )\n(N )\nthreshold) Eret (t) \u2212 E0 , where E0 > 0 denotes the\ntotal ionization potential of the N \u2212 1 (up to the recollision time t inactive) electrons. The distribution of energy and momentum over the N electrons is assumed to\nbe completely statistical and only governed by the available phase space. At the time t + \u2206t, the N electrons\n\n\f2\nbecome free to move in the laser field, which is described\nby the vector potential A(t) such that A(t) = 0 outside\nthe pulse.\nThe corresponding distribution of the final electron\nmomenta pn (n = 1, . . . , N ) is proportional to\nZ\n\u0010\n(N )\nF (p1 , p2 , . . . , pN ) = dt\u2032 R(t\u2032 )\u03b4 E0 \u2212 Eret (t)\n!\nN\n1X\n2\n[pn + A(t + \u2206t)] , (1)\n+\n2 n=1\nwhere the integral extends over the ionization time t\u2032 .\nThe \u03b4 function expresses the fact that the total kinetic\nenergy of the N participating electrons at the time t+ \u2206t\nis fixed by the first-ionized electron at its recollision time\nt. This constitutes the one and only condition on the final\nmomenta pn . The only free parameter of this model is\nthe time delay \u2206t between the recollision time and the\ntime when the electrons become free. It is the sum of a\nthermalization time \u2206tth \u2013 the time it takes to establish\nthe statistical ensemble \u2013 and a possible additional \"dwell\ntime\", until the electrons become free. By comparing the\npredictions of the model with the data, we will be able\nto infer a value of \u2206t, which in turn provides an upper\nlimit for the thermalization time \u2206tth .\nThis model is an extension to NSMI of a classical\nmodel introduced for NSDI for \u2206t = 0 [16, 17]. Sufficiently high above threshold, it produced momentum\ndistributions that were virtually indistinguishable from\ntheir quantum-mechanical counterparts. Statistical models similar to the one above have been used in many areas\nof physics. For example, the statistical Rice-RamspergerKassel-Marcus (RRKM) theory [18] describes thermalization of molecular vibrational degrees of freedom, and\nfor high-energy collisions of elementary particles and\nheavy ions statistical models have been utilized to predict\nthe momentum spectra of the reaction products [19]. An\nexcited complex as the doorway to NSMI was also considered in Ref. [20].\nA convenient feature of the ansatz (1) is that integration over unobserved momentum components is easily\ncarried out. To this end, we exponentialize the \u03b4 function in Eq. (1) with the help of its Fourier representation\n\n\u03b4(x) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nd\u03bb\nexp(\u2212i\u03bbx).\n2\u03c0\n\n(2)\n\nInfinite integrations over the momenta pn can then be\ndone by Gaussian quadrature. The remaining integration\nover the variable \u03bb is taken care of by the formula [21]\nZ \u221e\n2\u03c0 \u03bd\u22121\nd\u03bb\neip\u03bb =\np\n,\n(3)\n\u03bd\n\u0393(\u03bd) +\n\u2212\u221e (i\u03bb + \u01eb)\nwhere x\u03bd+ = x\u03bd \u03b8(x), with \u03b8(x) the unit step function and\n\u01eb \u2192 +0.\n\nFor comparison with the experiments [5, 6], we calculate the distribution of the momentum P of the ion.\nProvided the momentum of the absorbed laser photons\ncan\nPbe neglected, momentum conservation implies P =\n\u2212 N\nn=1 pn , so that\nFion (P) \u2261\n\nZ Y\nN\n\n=\n\n3\n\nd pn \u03b4 P +\n\nn=1\n\nN\nX\n\npn\n\nn=1\n3N\n\n3\n\n(2\u03c0) 2 \u2212 2\nN 3/2 \u0393( 23 (N \u2212 1))\n\nZ\n\n!\n\nF (p1 , p2 , . . . , pN )\n3N\n\ndt\u2032 R(t\u2032 ) (\u2206EN,ion )+2\n\n\u2212 52\n\n(N )\n\n1\nwith \u2206EN,ion \u2261 Eret (t) \u2212 E0 \u2212 2N\n[P \u2212 N A(t + \u2206t)]2 .\nIn the experiments thus far, the ion momentum transverse to the direction of the laser polarization is entirely\nor partly integrated over.

The figure displays the double-hump\nstructure of the ion momentum in NSMI of neon. When\nthe time delay \u2206t increases from 0, initially, the effect on\nthe momentum distribution is small. Later, however, the\ncenter positions of the humps start moving towards zero\nmomentum and the widths of the humps increase until\nthe two humps begin to merge. This behavior can easily\nbe understood from the recollision kinematics, which are\nillustrated in Fig. 2. The final electrons undergo maximal acceleration if they are released near a zero crossing\nof the electric field, which in the figure occurs at t = T .\nFor the example of triple ionization of neon, the earliest\n(3)\nrecollision with Eret > E0 takes place at t = 0.74T .\nAlready with a delay of \u2206t > 0.26T , all electrons will be\nreleased after the zero crossing, which results in significantly lower ion momenta.\n\n(4)\n\n\f-20\n\nt = 0\n\n:\n\nt = 0.05T\n\n:\n\nt = 0.1T\n\n:\n\nt = 0.15T\n\n:\n\nt = 0.2T\n\n-10\n\nCounts\n\n:\n\n0\n\nP\n\n||\n\n10\n\nCounts\n\nCounts\n\nCounts\n\nCounts\n\n3\n\n20\n\n(a.u.)\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Distribution of the longitudinal ion momentum for triple (upper panel) and quadruple (lower panel)\nnonsequential ionization of neon at 2 PWcm\u22122 calculated\nfrom Eq.

(6), to be\ncompared with the data of Ref. [5].\n\n\f4\ntion. This removes a longstanding discrepancy between\nmodels of the type discussed in Refs. [12, 16, 17] and the\ndata. For triple ionization, the calculated momentum\ndistributions are wider than those of the data, in particular for the higher intensity, even though the data may\ninclude a contribution of the partly sequential channel\nNe \u2192 Ne+ \u2192 Ne3+ , or the contribution of a recollisionexcitation channel, both of which are, of course, not part\nof the model.\nFigure 4 exhibits the results of our thermalization\nmodel for N = 3 for the conditions of Ref. [5]. The distribution of two components of the ion momentum is presented, the component parallel to the laser field and one\ntransverse component, which therefore provides a more\nstringent test of the model. The third component is integrated over in the data, which corresponds to Eq. (6).\nThe intensity given in the experiment is 1.5 PWcm\u22122 ;\nwe obtain good agreement with the data for the lower\nintensity of 1.0 PWcm\u22122 and \u2206t = 0.17T as before [22].\nThe nonzero delay \u2206t has little effect on the transverse\nwidth of the distribution, but it causes an elongation in\nthe longitudinal direction and moves the centers to lower\nmomenta, markedly improving the agreement with the\ndata.\nEncouraged by the good agreement between the model\nand the data, we interpret the delay for which we observed optimal agreement as an upper bound of the\nthermalization time \u2206tth , as argued above. This yields\n\u2206tth < \u2206topt = 0.17T \u2243 460 as. A lower limit of the\nthermalization time should be given by the inverse of\nthe plasma frequency for an electron p\ndensity \u03c1e = N in\natomic units. This produces \u2206tth < \u03c0/N , which is of\nthe order of the atomic unit of time.\nAll of the above discussion has been for neon. NSDI of\nargon appears to be governed by a recollision-excitation\nscenario [23]. We note in passing that for (quadruple)\nNSMI of argon we get good agreement of our statistical\nthermalization model with the data [6] for the experimental intensity and \u2206t = 0.35T , twice as long as for\nneon. Details will be given elsewhere.\nTo test the model further, and possibly to set a tighter\nupper limit on the thermalization time, it is necessary to\nrestrict the time range \u2206tCM of recollision (Fig. 2). If\nthermalization is more rapid than 460 as, then the width\nof the ion-momentum distribution will decrease as we restrict \u2206trec . There are a number of ways to minimize\n\u2206trec . Within limits, all that is needed is to lower the\nlight intensity or to increase the laser frequency. However, the best way to minimize \u2206trec and to control the\ntime of recollision is to use a second harmonic field, polarized perpendicular to the fundamental. The combined\nrequirement that the electron and ion recollide in both\ndirections allows the time of recollision to be precisely\ndetermined and controlled via the relative phase of the\ntwo beams.\nThe limit on the thermalization time that we deter-\n\nmine (as well as the much tighter bounds that seem feasible in future experiments) should apply to stationary\nelectron-atom scattering in general. From a collisionphysics perspective, as a result of streaking, the timedependent laser field reveals information that is hard to\nobtain by other means. The streaking principle should\nalso be applicable for studying nuclear dynamics. As in\nNSMI, nuclear processes also can be initiated by lasercontrolled re-collision [24] (of course, at much higher intensity). Any nuclear decay process that results in a mass\nor charge change of the fragments will be streaked by the\nlaser field just as electrons and ions are streaked in our\ncase.\nTo summarize, by comparison of experimental data\nfor triple and quadruple nonsequential ionization of neon\nwith a simple statistical recollision model where the returning electron thermalizes with a subset of the bound\nelectrons, we have been able to conclude that (i) for\nneon such a model appears to contain the most relevant\nphysics, and (ii) the time for this thermalization to occur\nis extremely fast, well below one femtosecond.\nWe gratefully acknowledge stimulating discussions\nwith G.G.
