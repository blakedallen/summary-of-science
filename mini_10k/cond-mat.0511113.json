Many experiments focused on the degenerate Fermi gas, while the bosonic component has\nonly been a tool to reach Fermi degeneracy via sympathetic cooling. Remarkable achievements include BCSBEC crossover [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], fermionic Bloch oscillations [11], observation of the 3D Fermi surface [12].\nBesides, Fermi-Bose systems display a wealth of interesting phenomena genuinely related to the presence of\n\n39\n\n41\n\nK\n\nK\n\n93.3%\n\n6.7%\nF'=3\n\n4 P3/2\n34 MHz\n\nF'=3\n\n4 P3/2\n17 MHz\n\nF'=2\n\n13 MHz\nd1\n\nd2\n\nd2 1\nw\n\nd2 2\nw\n\nF'=2\n\n4 MHz\n\nF'=1\nF'=0\n\nF'=1\n\nd1\n\nd22\n\nd2 1\nw\n\nd2 2\nw\n\nF'=0\n\n766.7 nm\n\nF=2\n\n4 S1/2\n\n462 MHz\nF=1\n\n236 MHz\n\nF=2\n\n254 MHz\n\n4 S1/2\n\nF=1\n\nFIG. 1: Level diagrams for 39 K and 41 K. In the upper part of\nthe diagram is shown the natural abundance of both isotopes.\n\ntwo species. A few, like interspecies Fano-Feshbach resonances [13, 14, 15] and boson-induced collapse of the\nFermi gas [16, 17], have already been observed but many\nmore have been proposed and still await experimental\nconfirmation, as e.g. boson-induced superfluidity [18]\nand mixed phases in optical lattices [19].\nOn the other hand, Bose-Bose mixtures have remained\nrelatively unexplored: after the pioneering work on 41 K87\nRb [20], to our knowledge only one other double-specie\ncondensate has been recently produced, namely 174 Yb176\nYb [21]. As for the K-Rb mixture, the recent precise determination of the interspecies scattering length\nby Feshbach spectroscopy [22] promises a rich phasediagram for the two species loaded in an optical lattice.\nIn view of an experiment on a K-Rb Bose-Bose mixture\nwe realized and characterized an intense, slow beam of\ncold bosonic potassium isotopes.\nAn intense and reliable source of cold atoms represents a favorable starting point for every degenerate\nmixture experiment. Two-dimensional magneto-optical\ntraps (2D-MOTs) of rubidium have been investigated by\nseveral groups [23, 24] and represent one of the brightest sources of slow atoms. With an appropriate doublechamber vacuum system, the 2D-MOT provides high\natomic flux through a small aperture between the two\nchambers. Therefore, it appears perfectly suited for loading an ordinary 3D-MOT in ultra-high vacuum (UHV)\nenvironment, the most widely used pre-cooling stage towards quantum degeneracy of dilute gases.\nIn this work we demonstrate an efficient 2D-MOT for\nbosonic potassium isotopes 39 K and 41 K, starting from a\nnatural abundance sample. Previously, only a 2D-MOT\nof fermionic 40 K has been implemented [17], while for\nbosonic isotopes no bright sources have been realized.\nThe peculiarity of bosonic potassium is the tight hyperfine structure of the D2 line excited state 42 P3/2 [25, 26]:\nas shown in Fig. 1, the separation between hyperfine levels is comparable to the transition linewidth, \u0393 = 2\u03c0\u00d76.2\nMHz. This feature represents the main physical difference with respect to almost all other alkalis (exception\n\n\f2\n\n\u03c3\n\n-\n\nProbe\nbeam\nMOT beams\nto UHV\nchamber\n\nMirror\n\n\u03c3\n\n-\n\nAtomic\nbeam\nPlug\nbeam\n\nPush beam\n\n\u03c3\n\n+\n\nMOT\ncoils\n\nMOT beams\n\ny\nx\nz\n\n\u03c3\n\n+\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Schematics of the 2D-MOT system.\nTwo retroreflected transverse cooling beams, with 3:1 elliptic\nsection, cross in the center of a Ti structure. A pair of copper\nwired coils generates the quadrupole magnetic field. Near\nthe end of the cell a drilled mirror is placed, tilted 45\u25e6 with\nrespect to the longitudinal axis z, along which a 1.5 mm waist\npush beam is propagating, forcing atoms to travel through the\nhole. A plug beam is placed near the hole in the mirror, and\na probe beam is used to detect the atomic flux in the UHV\nchamber.\n\nmade for Li), and it deeply affects the sub-Doppler cooling mechanism [27]. The aim of the present work is to\naddress the question of how efficiently 2D-MOT schemes\nwork for bosonic potassium.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we describe the experimental setup and some experimental\ntechniques used to generate and monitor the cold atomic\nbeam. The results of the characterization of the 2DMOT are reported in Sec. III, while a theoretical model\ngiving a good description of data is explained in Sec. IV.\nIn Sec. V we conclude with some brief considerations in\nview of future experiments.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nA.\n\nVacuum system\n\nThe vacuum system consists of two chambers, that we\ncall 2D-MOT and UHV chamber. The 2D-MOT apparatus is schematically reported in Fig. 2. Four rectangular\n80\u00d735 mm BK7 anti-reflection coated windows, providing optical access to four transverse trapping beams, are\nglued on a metallic rectangular frame, machined from\na titanium block. The atomic vapor is released in nat-\n\nural abundance by dispensers, whose injection current\ncontrols the pressure in the 2D-MOT chamber. The\nvacuum setup design gives the possibility to connect\nto the UHV chamber another identical 2D-MOT chamber. In this scheme it is possible to load a Rb-K mixed\n3D-MOT starting from two independently controllable\natomic beams.\nA flexible, 10 cm long, stainless steel bellow connects\nthe 2D-MOT and the UHV chambers. A metallic mirror, tilted 45\u25e6 with respect to the longitudinal axis, is\nplaced near the end of the 2D-MOT chamber and close\nto the bellow. A 1-mm hole is drilled at the center of the\nmirror to let the atoms exit the 2D-MOT chamber. This\nmirror allows us to send a hollow beam, counterpropagating with respect to the atoms, so that we can turn to\na 2D+ -MOT configuration [23].\nThe 2D-MOT chamber is pumped by a 20 l/s ion diode\npump, while in the UHV chamber a 55 l/s ion pump,\ncombined with the tiny conductance of the mirror hole,\ngenerates a pressure ratio between the two chambers up\nto 10\u22124 . Inside the bellow, three graphite tubes of increasing inner diameter (6 to 10 mm) improve the capability of pumping alkali metals.\nThe quadrupole magnetic field is generated by a pair\nof 90\u00d740 mm rectangular coils, fixed around the protruding glass windows. This elongated shape yields the\nrequired almost 2D axial symmetry to the trapping field.\nThe magnetic gradient in the x \u2212 y plane is set to 17\nGauss/cm. The current in each coil is independently\nadjusted to compensate for stray magnetic fields along\nthe vertical y direction. The compensation of horizontal\nfields along x is provided by a single large coil, placed far\nfrom the chamber. In this configuration, the longitudinal\nmagnetic gradient along z is a factor of 10 smaller than\nin the x \u2212 y plane and it will be hereafter neglected.\nB.\n\nLaser system\n\nThe cooling and trapping of alkali atoms requires in\nmost cases two laser frequencies which are conventionally\ncalled repumping and cooling. The force exerted upon\nthe atoms is dominated by the cooling light, tuned to a\nclosed transition, whereas the repumping light is mainly\nneeded to counteract the hyperfine optical pumping in\nthe ground state, consequent to off-resonant excitation.\nAs such, only a small fraction of the laser power suffices\nfor the repumping light.\nThe situation is completely different for bosonic potassium, where the tight hyperfine 42 P3/2 level spacings are\ncomparable to the natural linewidth \u0393. In this case, the\ncooling transition |F = 2i \u2192 |F \u2032 = 3i is not closed since\nthe |F \u2032 = 1, 2i states are excited with similar rates. A\nfast depletion of the |F = 2i ground state toward the\n|F = 1i ensues, the repumping light needs to be fairly\nintense and the cooling force arises from both frequencies [28]. Hence, the distinction between cooling and repumping light makes no sense. However, according to a\n\n\f3\n\ns\n\n(a)\n\npolarized beam, called push, with a waist of 1.5 mm. To\nachieve the 2D+ -MOT configuration, a fraction of this\nbeam is split and directed along the \u2212z direction (slowing\nbeam). We recall that the slowing beam has a hollow\nprofile since it enters the 2D-MOT after reflection upon\nthe drilled mirror.\nAnother vertical 2 mW beam, called plug, resonant\nwith the cooling transition, intercepts the atomic flux\nnear the mirror hole: atoms travel unperturbed to the\nUHV chamber when the plug beam is off and are swept\naway when the plug beam is on [29]. We use this beam to\nperform time-of-flight (TOF) measurements, as described\nbelow.\n\n(b)\n\nf\n\nd\n\nC.\n\nFIG. 3: (a) Typical acquisition of the fluorescence signal. At\nt=0 ms the plug beam is turned on, and after a delay of \u223c 8\nms the fluorescence starts decaying to zero.\n(b) Measured\nvelocity distribution (dots) of atomic beam obtained by a discrete derivative of (a) and Gaussian fit to data (solid line).\nThe fitted peak velocity is 32 m/s with a FWHM of 4.5 m/s.\n\nwidespread convention, we will also call repumping and\ncooling the transitions indicated respectively by \u03c91 and\n\u03c92 in Fig. 1.\nThe \u03c91 light is generated by a commercial high-power\nlaser diode with back-emission stabilization grating, providing 400 mW at 767.5 nm. The frequency stabilization is achieved by locking this laser using modulationtransfer saturation spectroscopy in a reference glass cell\ncontaining potassium vapor. To generate the \u03c92 radiation, a beam of about 40 mW is split from the laser\noutput, frequency shifted by an acousto-optic modulator\n(AOM) and then injected into a semiconductor tapered\namplifier that delivers 900 mW. In this way, only the\nrepumping laser needs to be frequency locked and the\nfrequency difference between the two sources is precisely\nset by the radio-frequency signal fed into the AOM. Each\nof the two main beams is split into several beams with\nindependent intensity and frequency control, achieved by\nmeans of double passage AOM stages.\nAfter a fiber mode-cleaning stage, a pair of cylindrical\nlenses gives a 3:1 elliptical shape, with a smaller waist\nof 9.4 mm, to two 2D-MOT transverse beams, which are\ncircularly polarized and retroreflected after the chamber.\nThe maximum laser power for each transverse beam is\n50 mW and 80 mW for \u03c91 and \u03c92 respectively.\nAlong the z axial direction, we shine an additional \u03c3 +\n\nDetection technique\n\nAs in Ref. [23], we analyze the atomic flux by means\nof TOF fluorescence detection. This is accomplished exposing the atomic flux to a vertical sheet of light (probe\nbeam), 30 cm after the mirror hole, and imaging the emitted fluorescence into a broad area photodiode. The peak\nintensity of the probe beam exceeds 0.5 W/cm2 , divided\nbetween \u03c91 and \u03c92 , both resonant, in a ratio 1:2.\nSwitching on the plug beam we interrupt the atomic\nflux; then, from the analysis of the decaying fluorescence\nsignal SF (t) as a function of time, we obtain the longitudinal velocity distribution \u03c1(v) of atoms. Denoting with\n\u03c4 the time required for an atom with velocity v along z\nto travel the distance L between the plug beam and the\nprobe light sheet, we can write the total flux \u03a6 as:\nZ\n\u03c4 d\nSF (\u03c4 ),\n(1)\n\u03a6 = \u03c1(v)dv, where \u03c1(v) = \u2212\n\u03b7 d\u03c4\nwith \u03c4 = L/v. Here \u03b7 is an experimental coefficient accounting for the calibration of the photodiode and for the\ncollection solid angle.\nFig. 3(a) shows a typical acquisition of the TOF signal, while the corresponding velocity distribution \u03c1(v),\nas derived from Eq. (1), is displayed in Fig. 3(b). To\nobtain the total atomic flux \u03a6, the peak velocity and the\nvelocity spread, we fit the data with a Gaussian function.\nIII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\n\nWe report the measured flux and velocity distribution\nof 39 K and 41 K atomic beams as a function of experimental parameters. We shifted from the first to the second\nisotope by changing the AOMs frequencies and the laser\nfrequency main locking point, preserving the geometrical alignment of the 2D-MOT beams. The analysis on\n41\nK was started only after optimization of frequencies\nand power for the 39 K, the former having lower relative\nabundance (6.7%) than the latter (93.3%).\nThe region of vapor pressure spanned in the experiment goes from 2.9\u00d710\u22128 to 3.9\u00d710\u22127 mbar, corresponding to the maximum allowed current in the dispenser.

The detuning values that maximize the atomic flux are \u03b41 = \u22123.9\u0393 and \u03b42 = \u22125.8\u0393. In (c) and (d) we report\nequivalent results obtained for 41 K atomic beam, for which the optimal detunings are \u03b41 = \u22122.5\u0393 and \u03b42 = \u22123\u0393. No data are\ntaken in the patterned regions.\n\nestimate the background gas pressure to be around 10\u22129\nmbar. If not otherwise specified, in the experiment we\nset the K gas total pressure to 7\u00d710\u22128 mbar.\nThe divergence of the atomic beam is measured by\nimaging with a CCD camera the fluorescence emitted in\nthe \u2212x direction. The image profile along z corresponds\nto the Gaussian profile of the short axis of probe light\nsheet, while the vertical (y direction) image profile extension is limited by the mirror hole. From the known\nwidth of the probe beam we calibrate the image magnification and therefore measure the size of the atomic\nbeam in the y direction. Given the distance of the probe\nbeam from the mirror hole, we calculate a divergence of\n(34 \u00b1 6) mrad.\nA.\n\nTrapping beam parameters\n\nTo characterize the 2D-MOT, we first set the intensity\nof both repumping and cooling 2D-MOT beams to their\nmaximum, respectively 50 and 80 mW per beam. We\nthen make a scan of both frequencies \u03c91 and \u03c92 , searching for the values that maximize the fluorescence signal,\nhence the total flux of atoms.\n\nWe only present data on the total flux \u03a6 because the\natomic velocities display no significant variations with\nthe 2D-MOT parameters. The measured peak velocities\nspan a range between 28 and 35 m/s, while the typical\ndistribution spread is 4.5 m/s (FWHM). Experimental\nresults for 39 K detunings are plotted in arbitrary units\nnormalized to the maximum value in Fig. 4(a). The detunings are defined throughout as follows: \u03b41 = \u03c91 \u2212 \u03c912\nand \u03b42 = \u03c92 \u2212\u03c923 , where we denote with \u03c9F F \u2032 the atomic\ntransition |42 S1/2 , F i \u2192 |42 P3/2 , F \u2032 i. Note that for these\nmeasurements the push beam contains only the repumping component with a power of 6 mW and frequency\n\u03c9p = \u03c912 \u2212 5.2\u0393. A more detailed analysis of the push\nbeam features is reported in Sec. III C. The detunings optimizing the atomic flux are \u03b41 = \u22123.9\u0393 and \u03b42 = \u22125.8\u0393,\nwhich correspond to neither of the two configurations reported in [28]. In that work, a MOT is best loaded with\nboth lasers detuned below all hyperfine components, in\na Raman configuration such as |\u03b42 \u2212 \u03b41 | = \u220632 where\n\u220632 = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 21 MHz is the hyperfine separation between\nthe |F \u2032 = 3i and |F \u2032 = 2i excited levels. Similar results\nwere later confirmed in [30]. We speculate that, since our\navailable laser beam intensities are a fifth to a tenth of\nthose in [28], we are unable to reach such large values of\n\n\f5\n\natoms/s)\n10\n\nAtomic flux (10\n\n10\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nFIG. 5: Measured 39 K gas pressure p in the 2D-MOT chamber\nreported as a function of dispenser current I. The solid line\nis a fit obtained using Eq. (2).\n\ndetunings.\nThen we fix the detunings and decrease both the cooling and repumping beams intensity. Fig. 4(b) shows the\n39\nK atomic flux as a function of the beams intensity: as\nwe see, there are no maxima in the explored range. Thus,\nan increase of the laser power should make the atomic\nbeam more intense.\nThe analysis on 41 K is performed along the same lines.\nHere, the push beam power is set to 6 mW and its frequency to \u03c9p = \u03c912 \u2212 4.5\u0393. Experimental results are\nplotted in Fig. 4(c, d). As before, while a peak is clearly\nvisible in the frequency dependence of the signal, there\nis none in the intensity-dependent plot. Even for 41 K,\nmore laser power would enhance the number of atoms in\nthe beam.\nThe largest contribution to the error on the measured\ntotal flux comes from the calibration parameter \u03b7, more\nprecisely from the evaluation of the solid angle in which\nfluorescence is collected. We estimate this systematic\nuncertainty to be 20%, while the statistical error is 5%.\n\nB.\n\nVapor pressure\n\nIn order to investigate the dependence of the atomic\nflux upon the potassium gas pressure, we found it convenient to establish a calibration of the vapor pressure p\nagainst the dispenser supply current I. This is done by\nprobing the atomic vapor using linear absorption spectroscopy. We simultaneously record the Doppler absorption profiles of the cooling transition in the 2D-MOT\nchamber and in the reference cell used for laser frequency\nlocking. The pressure of the latter is inferred from its\ntemperature: 2.2 \u00d7 10\u22127 mbar at 43 \u25e6 C. The calibration\ncurve of p as a function of I is well-fit by an exponential\nfunction:\np = A + exp(I/I0 \u2212 B),\n\n11\n10\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\n(a)\n\n34\n\nDispenser current (A)\n\n(2)\n\nPeak velocity (m/s)\n\nPressure (10 -8 mbar)\n\n100\n\n(b)\n\n33\n32\n31\n30\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n-8\n\nPressure (10\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\nmbar)\n\nFIG. 6: Measured 39 K atomic flux (a) and peak velocity (b)\nreported as a function of gas pressure in the 2D-MOT chamber. Over the critical value p = 2.1 \u00d7 10\u22127 mbar the atomic\nflux starts to be depleted by collisional effects. The solid line\nis a fit obtained using Eq. (4).\n\nwith A = (3.8 \u00b1 1) * 10\u22128 mbar, I0 = (0.54 \u00b1 0.07) A and\nB = (26.7 \u00b1 1.8). Both the experimental data and the fit\nfor 39 K are reported in Fig. 5.\nThe maximum allowed current in the dispenser, 6.4 A,\nsets the highest pressure we reach, i.e. 3.9 \u00d7 10\u22127 mbar.\nBelow the dispenser ignition point, a residual pressure of\n4 \u00d7 10\u22128 mbar is likely due to potassium vapor slowly\nreleased by the chamber walls.\nIn Fig. 6(a) we report the measured atomic flux as a\nfunction of the pressure for 39 K. As we can see, the flux\nincreases with pressure until a critical point and then decreases. In the case of 39 K this critical point occurs at\np = 2.1 \u00d7 10\u22127 mbar where a flux of 1.0 \u00d7 1011 atoms/s is\nreached. Such a critical point has been observed also for\nRb [23, 24, 31] and ascribed to collisions with the background vapor. When the inverse collision rate becomes\nof the same order of the cooling time tc , i.e. the time\nrequired to reach the mirror hole, the probability for an\natom to reach the mirror hole drops. Assuming this is the\ncase also for 39 K, we fit our data to obtain the collision\nrate. The total flux is:\nZ \u221e\n\u03c6(tc )dtc\n(3)\n\u03a6=\n0\n\nwhere \u03c6(tc ) is the cooling time distribution.\nIn the collisionless regime \u03c6(tc ) is linearly proportional\nto the density, hence the pressure, in the 2D-MOT cham-\n\n\f6\n\nEq.

We then\nuse Eq. (4) to fit the data, with two free parameters:\nan overall scaling factor and the collision rate to pressure ratio \u03ba. The results of the fitting is shown by the\nsolid line in Fig. 6(a). The collision rate given by the fit\n\u03b3(s\u22121 ) = (8.6 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 p (10\u22128 mbar) is approximately\none order of magnitude larger than the value reported in\n[32]: 0.3 s\u22121 at p = 4 \u00d7 10\u22129 mbar, i.e. 0.75 s\u22121 \u00d7 p (10\u22128\nmbar). Our value is closer to the collision rates observed\nwith rubidium. A meaningful comparison with Ref. [32]\nrequires a more detailed investigation on the role of lightassisted collisions, assumed negligible for the 2D-MOT.\nAnother noticeable effect upon pressure increase is the\nslowing down of the atomic beam, as shown by the plot\nof the peak velocity in Fig. 6(b). This behavior is in\ncontrast with the case of the simple rubidium 2D-MOT\ndescribed in [24], where an increase of the gas pressure\ncorresponds to the increase of the peak velocity. Therefore we attribute the observed effect to the progressive\nabsorption of the push beam along its propagation path\nby the atomic gas since, as reported below, the peak velocity decreases as the push beam intensity is reduced.\nAs mentioned before, when not otherwise specified all\ndata reported in this work have been taken at p = 7 \u00d7\n10\u22128 mbar.\nC.\n\nPush beam\n\nWe turn to the experimental investigation of the\natomic beam behavior when the push beam parameters\nare changed. This is a crucial characterization since we\nobserve no atomic flux in absence of the push beam, in accordance with the findings in experiments with rubidium\n[23, 24] where the 2D-MOT without push beam is not efficient in our pressure range. Surprisingly, for potassium\n\nAtomic flux (arb. units)\n\n1.2\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n(a)\n\n0.0\n36\n\nPeak velocity (m/s)\n\nber. In presence of collisions with the background vapor,\n\u03c6(tc ) is depleted for tc > \u03b3, where \u03b3 = \u03bap is the collision rate, proportional to the pressure p. Indeed, a single\ncollision with an atom at room temperature (vth = 250\nm/s) is sufficient to remove the cold atoms from the 2DMOT velocity capture range.

In\nthis analysis we set \u03b4p = \u22125.2\u0393.\n\nthe push beam works best if one uses only repumping\nlight, and therefore we define the push beam detuning\n\u03b4p = \u03c9p \u2212 \u03c912 . We defer the discussion of this point to\nthe end of the Section.\nFirst we report the atom flux and peak velocity,\nFigs. 7(a) and 7(b) respectively, for 39 K at fixed detuning \u03b4p = \u22125.2\u0393 as a function of power. Above 6 mW,\nthe atom number is approximately constant, while the\npeak velocity keeps increasing. Therefore, we use a power\nequal to 6 mW (peak intensity of 170 mW/cm2 ) in order\nto have the maximum flux with a velocity distribution\nstill within the capture range of the 3D-MOT in which\nthe atoms will be collected.\nNo clear enhancements of the flux stem from the addition of a counterpropagating hollow beam along \u2212z direction (2D+ -MOT configuration). Only a 20% reduction in\nmean velocity was found for a \u03c3 \u2212 beam polarization.\nGiven the hyperfine structure of potassium, one would\nexpect to increase the efficiency of the push force using\nboth cooling and repumping beams, since this avoids the\ndepletion of the ground state population. On the contrary, the atomic beam is deteriorated even by a small\nfraction of cooling light \u03c92 and it is almost extinguished\nwhen the \u03c92 intensity approaches that of \u03c91 . We attribute this effect to an increase of both the longitudinal\nvelocity and the radial temperature of the atoms, when\npushed by both frequencies. Instead, with a single frequency the hyperfine optical pumping confines the action\nof the push force within the 2D-MOT volume and the\natoms drift freely after the mirror hole.\nOne may argue that the push beam should then work\nalso with the frequency \u03c92 alone. We experimentally\n\n\f7\nTABLE I: Optimal experimental beams power values (P ) and detunings (\u03b4) used to generate a cold beam of 39 K and 41 K atoms.\nIn the right part of the table the total flux \u03a6 values and the corresponding peak velocities are reported.

We speculate that this is due to \u03c92 being\nmore prone to hyperfine optical pumping for two reasons: (i) in the 2D-MOT there is more cooling than repumping light, (ii) \u03c92 detuned a few linewidths to the\nred of the |F = 2i \u2192 |F \u2032 = 3i transition is near to the\n|F = 2i \u2192 |F \u2032 = 1, 2i resonances causing hyperfine optical pumping (the same effect is less important for the\n\u03c91 light, since the transitions |F = 1i \u2192 |F \u2032 = 2, 1i\nare closer and there is no hyperfine optical pumping for\n|F = 1i \u2192 |F \u2032 = 0i). Another possible way to avoid hyperfine optical pumping is to use a blue detuned cooling\nlight [33], even if this would increase the pushing efficiency mainly on fast atomic classes and hence confer to\nthe atomic flux a higher peak velocity.\nAs Fig. 7(a) shows, decreasing the intensity of the laser\nbeam the atomic flux decreases as well. In the pure\n2D-MOT configuration, when no push beam is shone on\natoms, no flux is detected, independently of both power\nand frequency of transverse beams and quadrupole mag-\n\n39\n\n41\n\nK\n\nK\n\nnetic field gradients.\nD.\n\nIn Tab. I are summarized all the experimental parameters which maximize the total atomic flux \u03a6 of the two\nisotopes and the values of the corresponding fluxes. For\np = 7 \u00d7 10\u22128 mbar high atomic fluxes are achieved, containing 6.2 \u00d7 1010 atoms/s and 5.2 \u00d7 109 atoms/s for\n39\nK and 41 K respectively. The pressure value and their\nsmall peak velocities, respectively 35 and 33 m/s, are\nperfectly adequate to an efficient subsequent loading in\na UHV environment 3D-MOT. By increasing p up to\n2.1\u00d710\u22127 mbar a flux of 1.0\u00d71011 atoms/s of 39 K is then\nobserved. Nearly the same gain is expected for 41 K flux\nas well at the same value of pressure p.\nThe high intensity of atomic fluxes is an essential point\nin order to reach a degenerate regime for K isotopes following a double MOT cooling and trapping scheme. At\noptimal detunings, with a 15 times lower light intensity,\nwe achieve a 3D-MOT loading rate higher than the one\nreported in [28]. Thus, we conclude that, to generate\na cold atomic beam, a 2D-MOT shows a much higher\nefficiency when compared to an ordinary 3D-MOT.\nIV.\n\n(a)\n\n(c)\n\n(b)\n\n(d)\n\n39\n\nFIG. 8: Measured atomic flux \u03a6 and peak velocity of K (a,\nb) and 41 K (c, d) as a function of the push beam frequency\ndetuning \u03b4p . The push beam power is set to 6 mW.\n\nSummary\n\nA SIMPLIFIED MULTILEVEL\nTHEORETICAL MODEL\n\nTo have a quantitative description of our observations\nwe use an extension of the theoretical model discussed in\n[31]. This model shortcuts the integration of the optical\nBloch equation by assuming a heuristic expression of the\ntotal force exerted by the different beams, all having the\nsame frequency, on a two-level atom:\n\nf =\nsj =\n\nsi\nh\u0304\u0393 X\nP\nki\n,\n2 i\n1 + j sj\n\n(5)\n\nIj\n\u03932\nIs \u03932 + 4(\u03b4j \u2212 kj * v)2\n\nwhere i, j denote the beams and Is = \u03c0hc\u0393/(3\u03bb3 ) is\nthe two-level saturation intensity, equal to 1.8 mW/cm2\n\n\f8\nfor potassium D2 line. Authors of Ref. [31] employ this\nmodel to analyze a 3D-MOT of Rb with the addition of\na push beam. The extension of this treatment to bosonic\npotassium, because of the narrow upper level structure,\nrequires to take into account all the allowed hyperfine\ntransitions. For this purpose, we introduce the further\nassumption that forces arising from different transitions\nadd independently. This consistently disregards coherences among the two 4S1/2 hyperfine states, which however play no role in the Doppler cooling mechanism. In\nprinciple, we should consider even the Zeeman structure\nof the hyperfine levels; in practice, to reduce the number\nof transitions contributing to the total force, we calculate\nthe detunings and the line strength in a manner to average out the Zeeman sublevels. For each laser beam i and\neach transition |F i \u2192 |F \u2032 i, we define the average detunF\u2032\ning \u2206F\nas the center-of-mass of all the Zeeman comi\nponents weighted by the squared Clebsch-Gordan coefficients |c(F \u2032 , m\u2032 ; 1, \u03c3i , F, m)|2 , where \u03c3i denotes the beam\npolarization (all beams are circularly polarized with the\nMOT required helicity). This detuning depends linearly\non the displacement from the 2D-MOT axis via the magnetic field gradient.

From the\nintegration we extract: (i) the fraction \u2118 of the atoms exiting the mirror hole to the atoms entering the 2D-MOT\nvolume, (ii) the longitudinal velocity distribution of the\natomic beam, and (iii) the distribution of the cooling\ntime \u03c6(tc ), as defined earlier.\nTo obtain the total flux, we only need to multiply \u2118 by\nthe total number of atoms entering the cooling volume\nper second, at pressure p and room temperature T :\n\nWe incorporate hyperfine optical pumping by breaking the force into two parts, due to the cooling and the\nrepumping light, weighted by the relative populations in\nthe F = 2 and F = 1 ground levels. Therefore, the\nexpression (5) of the total force is generalized as follows:\nf =\n\n(a)\n\nNumerical Simulations\n\nA numerical integration of the classical equations of\nmotion yields the phase-space trajectories. We consider\nonly the atoms that, at t = 0, lie on the boundary surface\n\n(8)\n\nIn our simulation multiple scattering of light and intrabeam atomic collisions are neglected. The collisions with\nbackground gas, occurring at rate \u03b3 = 60 s\u22121 , are accounted for by weighting each trajectory with a factor\nexp(\u2212\u03b3tc ) to deplete the tail of atoms with long cooling\ntimes tc . We also select only those atoms flying in a cone\n34 mrad wide around the longitudinal axis z.\nSetting the experimental parameters as in Table I, with\na quadrupole magnetic field gradient of 17 Gauss/cm, for\n39\nK we obtain a total flux \u03a6sim = 8.7\u00d71010 atoms/s, with\na peak velocity of 30.2 m/s, in good agreement with the\nexperimental values reported in Table I.\nRepeating the simulation for different values of the\npush beam power and detuning we find the curves plotted\nin Fig. 9. The agreement with the experimental findings\nis satisfactory for the peak velocities. As for the total\nflux, the model shows saturation in push power at lower\nvalues than in the experiment and an optimum detuning\nof \u22126\u0393 close to the observed value of \u22125.2\u0393. The calcu-\n\n\f9\nlated dependence of atomic flux on push beam power and\ndetuning reproduces only qualitatively the experimental\ncurves of Figs. 6(a) and 7(a). We believe that coherent\neffects ignored in our simulations are likely responsible\nfor the discrepancies with data. A more exact analysis\nbased on the integration of optical Bloch equations is\nneeded to address these issues but is beyond the scope of\nour simplified model.\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK\n\nThe main conclusion of this work is that, similar to rubidium, potassium atoms can be coaxed into an intense\nand cold beam, still preserving the UHV constraints. Recently, we have used two separate 2D-MOT beams to load\na double-specie K/Rb MOT in the UHV chamber as a\npreliminary step towards quantum degenerate Bose-Bose\nmixtures. The combination of potassium and rubidium\noffers a wealth of possibilities to tune the interspecies\ninteractions via Feshbach resonances [22]. Broad FanoFeshbach resonances are predicted for 39 K-87 Rb and 41 K-\n\n[*] E-mail address: catani@lens.unifi.it\n[1] F. Schreck, L. Khaykovich, K. L. Corwin, G. Ferrari, T.\nBourdel, J.

For 39 K, sympathetic cooling with Rb can\nbe a route to single condensates with tunable interactions, where resonances are expected around 40 G for two\natoms in the magnetically trapped state |F = 1, m = \u22121i\n[34] and around 20 G for the absolute ground state [35].\nAn exciting perspective is to tune interactions in the\npresence of an optical lattice, where a rich diagram of\ninsulating and superfluid phases is predicted when the\ninterspecies scattering length is varied [36]. Also, as\nsuggested in [37], entering the Mott-insulator regime for\nboth species paves the way to Feshbach-associated longlived bosonic heteronuclear molecules, since three-body\nlosses can be suppressed by tailoring the Mott phase to\nhave one atom per species in each lattice site.\nThis work had financial support from Ente Cassa di\nRisparmio in Firenze and from Istituto Nazionale di\nFisica Nucleare through project SQUAT.
