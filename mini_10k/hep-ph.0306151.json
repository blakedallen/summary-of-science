One may present the particle production from strings via chains of quark lines [1] as shown in fig. 1. It\nturns out that the two string picture is not enough to explain for example the large multiplicity fluctuations in proton-proton scattering at\ncollider energies: more strings are needed, one adds therefore one or\nmore pairs of quark-antiquark strings, as shown in fig. 2. The variables\nxi refer to the longitudinal momentum fractions\ngiven to the string ends.\nP\nEnergy-momentum conservation implies\nxi = 1.\n\u2217\ninvited speaker,\n9th Winter Workshop on Nuclear Dynamics, Breckenridge, Colorado, February 9 - 14,\n2003\n\u2020\nAlexander von Humboldt Fellow\n\n1\n\n\fa)\n\nb)\n\nFigure 1: (a) A pair of strings.

Here, GribovRegge theory comes at help, which tells us that the probability for a\nconfiguration with n elementary interactions is proportional to \u03c7n /n!,\nsee fig. 3. where \u03c7 is a function of energy and impact parameter. Here,\n\nprob(\n\n)~\n\n\u03c7\n\nprob(\n\n)~\n\n2\n\n\u03c7/ 2\n\nFigure 3: Probabilities for configurations with one and two elementary\ninteractions (Pomerons), represented as dashed lines.\na dashed vertical line represents an elementary interaction (referred to\nas Pomeron).\nNow one identifies the elementary interactions (Pomerons) from GribovRegge theory with the pairs of strings (chains) in the string model, and\none uses the above-mentioned probability for n Pomerons to be the\nprobability for configurations with n string pairs. Unfortunately this\nis not at all consistent, for two reasons:\n1. Whereas in the string picture the first and the subsequent pairs are\nof different nature, in the Gribov-Regge model all the Pomerons are\nidentical.\n2. Whereas in the string (chain) model the energy is properly shared\namong the strings, in the Grivov-Regge approach does not consider\nenergy sharing at all (the \u03c7 is a function of the total energy only)\nThese problems have to be solved in order to make reliable predictions.\n\n2 NEXUS\nNEXUS is a self-consistent multiple scattering approach to proton-proton\nand nucleus-nucleus scattering at high energies. The basic feature is\nthe fact that several elementary interaction, referred to as Pomerons,\nmay happen in parallel. We use the language of Gribov-Regge theory\n3\n\n\fto calculate probabilities of collision configurations (characterized by\nthe number of Pomerons involved, and their energy) and the language\nof strings to treat particle production. We treat both aspects, probability calculations and particle production, in a consistent fashion: In\nboth cases energy sharing is considered in a rigorous way[2], and in both\ncases all Pomerons are identical. This is one new feature of our approach. Another new aspect is the necessity to introduce remnants:\nThe spectators of each baryon form a remnant. They will play an important role on particle production in the fragmentation region and at\nlow energies (ELab =40-200 GeV). In the following we discuss the details\nof our approach.\nWe first consider inelastic proton-proton scattering. We imagine an\narbitrary number of elementary interactions to happen in parallel, where\nan interaction may be elastic or inelastic, see fig. 4. The inelastic amplitude is the sum of all such contributions in with at least one inelastic\nelementary interaction is involved.

Integrating over impact\nparameter provides the corresponding cross section. By this we obtain a probability distribution for the number of elementary interactions\n(number of Pomerons) and the momenta of these Pomerons.\nHow to form strings from Pomerons? No matter whether singlePomeron or multiple-Pomeron exchange happens in a proton-proton\nscattering, all Pomerons are treated identically. Each Pomeron is identified with two strings.\nThe string ends are quarks and antiquarks from the sea. This differs\nfrom traditional string models, where all the string ends are valence\nquarks. Due to the large number of Pomerons this is impossible in our\napproach. The valence quarks stay in remnants. Being formed from see\nquarks, string ends from cut Pomerons have complete flavor symmetry\nand produce particles and antiparticles in equal amounts.\nRemnants are new objects, compared to other string models, see\nfig.6. A remnant contains three valence quarks and the corresponding\nantiparticles of the partons representing the string ends. We parametrize\nthe mass distribution of the remnant mass as P (m2 ) \u221d (m2 )\u2212\u03b1 , where m\nis taken within the interval [m2min , x+ s], with s being the squared total\nenergy in the center of mass system, mmin being the minimum mass of\nhadrons to be made from the remnant's quarks and antiquarks, and x+\nbeing the light-cone momentum fraction of the remnant. Through fitting\nthe data at 158 GeV, we determine the parameter \u03b1 = 2.25. Remnants\ndecay into hadrons according to n-body phase space[3].\nThe most simple and most frequent collision configuration has two\nremnants and only one cut Pomeron, represented by two q \u2212 q strings\n5\n\n\fremnant\n\nremnant\n\n+\n\n+ ...\n\nremnant\n\nremnant\n\nFigure 6: Remnants in single (two strings) and double scattering (four\nstrings): in any case, two remnants contribute.\nas in Fig.7(a). Besides the three valence quarks, each remnant has in\naddition a quark and an antiquark to compensate the flavor.\nWe assume that an antiquark q\u0304 from a string end may be replaced\nby a diquark qq, with a small probability Pqq . In this way, we get quarkdiquark (q \u2212 qq) strings from cut Pomerons. The qqq Pomeron end (the\nsum of the two corresponding string ends) has to be compensated by\nthe three corresponding antiquarks in the remnant, as in Fig.7(b). The\n(3q3q) remnant decays according to phase space, so mainly into three\nmesons (3M), and only with a very small probability into a baryon and\nan anti-baryon (B+B). For symmetry reasons, the q string end is replaced by an antidiquark qq with the same probability Pqq . This yields\na q \u2212 qq string and a (6q) remnant, as shown in Fig.7(c). The (6q) remnant decays into two baryons. Since q-qq strings and q \u2212 qq strings have\nthe same probability to appear from cut Pomerons, baryons and antibaryons are produced in the string fragmentation with the same probability. However, from remnant decay, baryon production is favored due\nto the initial valence quarks.\nWith decreasing energy the relative importance for the particle production from the strings as compared to the remnants decreases, because the energy of the strings is lowered as well. If the mass of a string\nis lower than the cutoff, it will be discarded. However, the fact that an\ninteraction has taken place is taken into account by the excitation of\nthe remnant, which follows still the above mentioned distribution.\n6\n\n\fa)\n\nb)\n\nc)\n\nFigure 7: (a) The most simple and most frequent collision configuration has\ntwo remnants and only one cut Pomeron represented by two q \u2212 q strings. (b)\nOne of the q string-ends can be replaced by a qq string-end. (c) With the same\nprobability, one of the q string-ends can be replaced by a qq string-end.\n\n3 Results\nFig. 8 shows the rapidity spectra for pp at 158 GeV. We included the\n\u039b, \u039b\u0304, \u039e, \u039e\u0304 spectra, which have been published earlier [4]. Where data\nfrom the NA49 collaboration are available, we have included them in\nthe plot[6]. The yield gives the calculated average multiplicity of the\nparticle species in 4\u03c0. We see that the experimental data are reasonable\ndescribed. The non strange baryons as well as those which contain one\nstrange quark show a double hump structure, the others are peaked at\nmid rapidity. This is a consequence of the three source structure (two\nremnants and Pomerons) in our approach. The leading baryon has still\nthe quantum number of the incoming baryon but is moderately excited.\nTherefore it may disintegrate into baryons whose quantum numbers\ndiffer not too much.\nWe observe in particular more \u03a9 than \u03a9\u0304[5], as seen in experiment [7].\nThis is a consequence of the modification of NEXUS 3, explained in [4],\nas compared to the original NEXUS 2 version [2] (and many other string\nmodels), which yields more \u03a9\u0304 than \u03a9 due to the string topology .\n\nReferences\n[1] J.
