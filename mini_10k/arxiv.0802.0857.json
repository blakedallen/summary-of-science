However, for strongly magnetic atoms a conventional narrow-line\nmagneto-optical trap (MOT) is destabilized by competition between optical and magnetic forces.\nWe overcome this difficulty in Er by developing an unusual narrow-line MOT that balances optical\nand magnetic forces using laser light tuned to the blue side of a narrow (8 kHz) transition. The\ntrap population is spin-polarized with temperatures reaching below 2 \u03bcK. Our results constitute\nan alternative method for laser cooling on weak transitions, applicable to rare-earth-metal and\nmetastable alkaline earth elements.\n\nThe extension of laser cooling techniques to weak,\nnarrow-line optical transitions [1, 2] opens new possibilities to reach low temperatures and high phasespace densities for atoms with multiple valence electrons [3]. The main advantage of a kilohertz-linewidth\n(\u0393/2\u03c0 \u2248 1 kHz) transition is the low Doppler temperature, ~\u0393/(2kB ), which in principle enables Doppler laser\ncooling to nanokelvin temperatures without evaporative\ntechniques. However, the maximum radiation pressure\nforce that can be applied, ~k\u0393/2, is correspondingly small\nfor a narrow transition and may not even be sufficient to\nlevitate atoms against gravity (2\u03c0/k is the optical wavelength). Experimental studies of narrow-line laser cooling have concentrated on the 1 S0 to 3 P1 transitions in\nMg, Ca, and Sr. For Sr [3, 4, 5, 6, 7], optical forces\nare sufficient to compensate gravity, but the resulting interplay of forces modifies the trap dynamics [5, 6]. For\nCa and Mg, optical forces are weaker (\u0393 is smaller), so\nthat more complicated schemes such as quenched cooling\n[8, 9], metastable trapping [10], and two-photon cooling\n[11] are necessary for stable trapping against gravity.\nThe rare-earth-metal element Er also has multiple valence electrons and narrow optical transitions [12], but\nin contrast to the alkaline earths, Er also has a large\nground state magnetic moment (7 \u03bcB ) that provides an\nadditional \"handle\" for manipulation. For the narrow\n(\u0393/2\u03c0 = 8 kHz) transition at 841 nm in Er, the magnetic\nforce is equal to the maximum radiation pressure force at\na field gradient of only 0.3 T/m. As a result, a magnetooptical trap (MOT) is destabilized if the trapping lasers\ntend to drive atoms into untrapped magnetic sublevels.\nIn this Letter, we exploit this comparable magnitude of\noptical and magnetic forces in order to form a narrow-line\nMOT for Er. In our \"strongly magnetic\" MOT, confinement is provided by a combination of dissipative optical\nforces and conservative magnetic forces. The trap is globally stable when the trapping lasers are tuned to the blue\nside of the (unshifted) atomic resonance. The resulting\ntrap forms at a position of non-zero magnetic field, with\na spin-polarized population at temperatures below 2 \u03bcK.\nIn a conventional MOT, on the other hand, confinement\n\nforces are purely optical, cooling occurs for red-detuned\nlasers, and the trap population is (on average) unpolarized at a position of zero magnetic field. The unusual\nfeatures of our trap are explained by a Doppler cooling model including optical pumping between magnetic\nsublevels. Our results constitute the lowest temperature\nachieved for Er atoms and provide an important benchmark in the study of highly magnetic rare-earth-metal\nelements.\nMagnetic forces modify the description of magnetooptical cooling and trapping in a nontrivial way. Consider the z motion of an atom in a magnetic field\nB(z) = B \u2032 z (B \u2032 > 0), together with a circularly polarized traveling-wave laser beam (frequency \u03c9L , wave\nvector ~k = k\u1e91 with positive or negative k corresponding\nto the direction of propagation) detuned by \u03b4 = \u03c9L \u2212 \u03c9A\nfrom the atomic transition \u03c9A . We restrict attention to\nz > 0 where B(z) is positive. Including the gravitational\nforce \u2212M g \u1e91, the semiclassical position z- and velocity\nvz -dependent force on the atom is [5, 6, 13, 14]\nFz (z, vz ) = F0 +\n\n~k\u0393\ns\n\u0001\n2 1 + s + 4 \u03b4/\u0393 \u2212 z/z \u00b1 \u2212 kvz /\u0393 2\n0\n(1)\n\nwhere\nF0 = \u2212gg mJ \u03bcB |B \u2032 | \u2212 M g\n\n,\n\nz0\u00b1 =\n\n~\u0393\n.\n\u03bc\u2032\u00b1 |B \u2032 |\n\n\u03bc\u2032\u00b1 = (\u00b1ge +mJ \u2206geg )\u03bcB , gg and ge are the Land\u00e9 factors\nfor the ground and excited states, \u2206geg = ge \u2212 gg , mJ is\nthe projection of the angular momentum J along the local magnetic field direction, s is the saturation parameter\n[14], and \u00b1 corresponds to \u03c3 \u00b1 polarization.\nThe force field of Eq. (1) is characterized by the parameter F0 = 2F0 /(~k\u0393), the ratio of the magnetic and\ngravitational forces to the light force. For k < 0, \u03c3 \u2212\npolarization, and red laser detuning \u03b4 < 0, simultaneous\ncooling and trapping (i.e., stable equilibrium in both z\nand vz ) are achieved for 0 < F0 < s/(1 + s) \u2264 1, which\nalso requires mJ < 0. Near equilibrium, the force is approximately Fz (z, vz ) \u2248 \u2212\u03ba(z \u2212 zeq ) \u2212 \u03b2vz where zeq is\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Potential energy for a magnetic atom\nin a narrow-line MOT. U (z) is in units of ~k\u0393z0 /2. At the top,\ncounterpropagating laser beams are labeled by their left-hand\ncircular (LHC) helicity. Curves are shown for an atom with\nJ = 6, for red or blue detuning and various values of mJ . For\nan atom in state mJ , the curve at higher (lower) energy [blue\n(red) online] represents the potential for \u03b4 > 0 (\u03b4 < 0). Optical pumping stabilizes the stretched trap states (mJ = \u00b1J),\nsince blue (red)-detuned trapping lasers tend to drive atoms\ntoward the upper (lower) potential energy curve. Increasing\nline thickness (from dashed to thin to thick lines) represents\nincreasing population of a state due to optical pumping. Insets a) and b) show the resonant optical transitions at trap\nminima labeled a and b. Here, for mJ = J, F0 = 1/2 in\nthe absence of gravity; the gravitational force is 20 % of the\nmagnetic force.\n\nthe trap position, and \u03ba and \u03b2 define the spring constant and velocity damping coefficient, respectively. At\nzeq , magnetic forces push the atom away from the origin\nwhile optical forces push it back toward the origin, and\nthe red-detuned laser provides Doppler cooling towards\nvz = 0. While cooling and trapping may be expected for\na red-detuned beam, a similar equilibrium point exists for\n\u03b4 > 0, \u03c3 + polarization, and k > 0 in the weak-field seeking states with mJ > 0. In this case, magnetic forces pull\nthe atom toward the origin while optical forces push it\naway and the laser still provides Doppler cooling because\nit is red-detuned from the Zeeman-shifted transition frequency at the trap position. Therefore, a stable trap\nforms for appropriately polarized red- or blue-detuned\nlaser light, as long as the direction of laser propagation\nopposes F0 and the radiation pressure is sufficiently large.\nNow consider counterpropagating laser beams carrying\nopposite angular momenta, as in a standard MOT [14].\nIn this situation, the sign of the magnetic force reverses\nat z = 0, and the same circular polarization induces \u03c3\ntransitions of opposite sign. As a result, stable equilibria form on either side of the origin, and a conservative\nmagnetic trap also forms at z = 0 for weak-field seeking (mJ > 0) substates. Generalizing Eq. (1) to include\nthe changing sign of the magnetic field and summing the\nforce of each\nR beam, we find the potential energy curves\nU (z) = \u2212 Fz (z \u2032 , 0)dz \u2032 shown in Fig. 1. For the nonmagnetic mJ = 0 substate with \u03b4 < 0, the potential\nenergy U (z) reproduces the results in Refs. [5, 6] for a far-\n\nFIG. 2: Cloud images (top) and timing sequence (bottom)\nduring trap loading.\n\ndetuned, narrow-line Sr MOT in the presence of gravity.\nFor magnetic states (mJ 6= 0) in the absence of gravity,\nthe potential minima at points labeled a and b exhibit\nidentical values of \u03ba and \u03b2. Point c is a purely magnetic trap. Optical pumping populates the \"stretched\"\ntrap states |mJ | = J in a detuning-dependent way. Bluedetuned trapping lasers become resonant on \u03c3 + transitions and therefore tend to drive atoms to the mJ = +J\nmagnetic substate exhibiting a globally stable, V-shaped\ntrap potential. In contrast, red-detuned lasers approach\nresonance on \u03c3 \u2212 transitions tending to drive atoms to the\nmJ = \u2212J substate, with a globally unstable \u039b-shaped\npotential. We thus expect, and find in practice, that\nthe blue-detuned trap is quite robust, while we were unable to observe any trap in the red-detuned case. Note\nalso that magnetic forces can compensate gravity in this\ntrap, and thus optical forces need not exceed gravitational\nforces. This trap may therefore be useful for narrowline cooling of metastable, magnetically trapped alkaline\nearth atoms [10] in cases where ~k\u0393/2 . M g, or even\nfor cooling on ultranarrow transitions such as the 2.1 Hz\ntransition in Er [12].\nTo investigate the cooling limits of this force, we note\nthat near zeq the kinetic energy of an atom increases by\ntwice the photon recoil energy (~2 k 2 /2M ) at the equilibrium absorption rate F0 \u0393/2, while the energy damping\nrate is \u03b2vz2 [13].

However, one is usually interested in creating a compact sample that is not only cold but also dense.

In both images, a faint cloud of\natoms trapped in the conservative magnetic trap can be seen\nas well.\n\ndensity is maximized for F0 = 1/2. For the 841 nm\ntransition in Er, the highest phase-space density is predicted to occur at a reasonable magnetic field gradient\nof 0.15 T/m with 1D kinetic energy distribution corresponding to Teq = 2TD = 380 nK.\nTo observe these dynamics, we modified the apparatus in Refs. [15, 16]. In brief, approximately 105 166 Er\natoms are trapped and cooled to 150 \u03bcK in a standard\nMOT on the bright (\u0393/2\u03c0 = 36 MHz [17]) transition at\n401 nm. For narrow-line cooling, we use an 841 nm diode\nlaser locked by a fast servo to a passively stable cavity\n[18]. Acousto-optic modulators are used for fine control\nof both the frequency and power. At the MOT position, we use a maximum 841 nm laser power of 3 mW\ndistributed into three orthogonal beams with Gaussian\nwaists of (4.5 \u00b1 0.05) mm [19]. The 401 nm beams are\ntilted by 6\u25e6 to provide optical access for the 841 nm\nbeams. Temperature measurements are made by turning\noff all optical and magnetic fields then imaging fluorescence from the expanding cloud by pulsing on the 401 nm\nMOT lasers for 100 \u03bcs.\nThe narrow-line MOT loading procedure is shown in\nFig. 2. Atoms are initially trapped and cooled on the\n401 nm transition (the 841 nm beams are also on during this period). At time t = 0, the 401 nm beams are\nextinguished leaving only the 841 nm beams. The field\ngradient is ramped down over 100 ms to allow atoms to\ncollect in the narrow-line MOT, then raised to recompress the atomic cloud. Two typical narrow-line MOT\nfluorescence images are shown in Fig. 3. In image a),\nwe used a single blue-detuned (\u03b4/2\u03c0 \u2248 1 MHz) beam\nto push atoms into a 1D narrow-line MOT. Because the\natoms are polarized in magnetically trapped mJ > 0 substates, they are confined by magnetic forces along \u00b1x,\n\u00b1y and +z and an optical force along \u2212z. Cloud expansion measurements show asymmetric velocities corresponding to temperatures Tx = (48 \u00b1 3.3) \u03bcK along the x\ndirection and Tz = (3.9 \u00b1 0.4) \u03bcK along the z direction,\n\n0\n0\n\n10\n\nZeq [mm]\n\n-0.5\n\n6\n\n-1.5\n1\n2\n3\nDetuning \u03b4/2\u03c0 [MHz]\n\n1\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\nSaturation parameter s\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Narrow-line MOT temperatures Tx\n(open) and Tz (filled) as a function of the axial-beam saturation parameter s.

A number of\npredictions of the 1D model are confirmed in Fig. 4. In\nparticular, the temperature exhibits\n\u221a a minimum for a\nsmall value of s and increases as s for s \u2264 100, the\ntemperature is largely independent of \u03b4, and the trap\nposition varies linearly with \u03b4. (Note the similar behavior in Refs. [5, 6] where red-detuned lasers balanced Sr\natoms against gravity).\nTo test the spin polarization, we turn off the 841 nm\nlasers at t = 0, leaving all magnetic fields on. Because\natoms are in weak-field seeking states, they feel a restoring force toward the origin. As shown in Fig. 5, atoms begin oscillating in the conservative potential with a period\nof approximately 30 ms. We observe high-fidelity oscillations in the position of peak density, with the oscillation\nperiod indicating a spin polarization of (74 \u00b1 6) %. After a few oscillation periods, the anharmonic quadrupole\npotential leads to complicated cloud trajectories [20].\nOur trap is relatively insensitive to the polarization of\nthe transverse beams, and forms even when some retroreflections are blocked. In contrast, the trap is very sensitive to the polarization of the vertical trapping laser,\nwhile the retroreflection of this beam is inconsequential.\n\n\f4\nIn future experiments, we plan to optimize loading procedures in order to study the atom number and phase-space\ndensity for this trap. These techniques should be applicable to the other rare-earth-metal elements and to alkaline earth elements in magnetically trapped, metastable\nstates.\n\nFIG. 5: (Color online) Oscillation of the atomic cloud after\nrelease into the magnetic trap. (Upper) Cloud images at early\ntimes. (Lower) z position of maximum density together with\na fit to the expected trajectory.\n\nWe have formed traps above and below the origin by reversing the direction of a single beam. The lower trap\nis more robust, presumably due to the stabilizing influence of gravity. These trap characteristics can be qualitatively explained from geometric considerations. Because\nof the large detuning and narrow atomic line, atoms approach resonance only within a narrow ellipsoid of constant magnetic field [5, 6]. \u03c0 and \u03c3 \u2212 transitions can be\nneglected due to the large value of \u03b4, so the polarizations of the transverse beams only affect the coupling\nefficiency to the \u03c3 + transition, via a position-dependent\ngeometrical factor. Although the overall behavior of the\ntrap is well-understood, our measured temperatures are\nalways slightly higher than predicted by the simple 1D\nmodel. This discrepancy may be explained by heating\nduring temperature measurement, since we observe that\ntransients during magnetic field shutoff impart residual\ncloud velocities of a few cm/s. Given the total energy\nrequired to accelerate the cloud, a few percent spread\nin spin polarization results in a few percent spread in\ncloud velocity, corresponding to \u03bcK-scale heating. The\ncloud temperature may also be affected by stimulated\ntransitions or polarization-gradient effects, which cannot\nbe properly analyzed without a 3D quantum mechanical\nmodel.\nIn summary, we have demonstrated a new type of\nnarrow-line MOT for strongly magnetic atoms, in which\noptical and magnetic forces play equally important roles.\n\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge contributions from\nS.
