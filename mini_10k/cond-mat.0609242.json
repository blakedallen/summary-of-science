Generally speaking, the self-organisation of\nparticles trapped in a 2D thin liquid film is induced during the last stage of drying through\nthe action of lateral capillary forces. As reported by Paunov [8], those forces are analogous to\nelectrostatic interactions and \"[...] result from the overlapping of the liquid surface deformations around the particles\". The liquid surface deformations appear when the particles are\nno more covered but surrounded by the liquid film at the last stage of drying. The overviews\nof Kralchevsky [9] [10] and Nagayama [11] point out that these interactions are fundamental\nto understand the self-patterning mechanisms of particles trapped in a 2D thin film dried\non a substrate in most cases. However, the self-patterning processes of particles submitted\nto lateral capillary forces can be balanced by the interactions between the particles and\nthe substrate. For example, the lateral capillary forces can be correlated to particle - substrate electrostatic interactions. Indeed, Aizenberg [15] and Huwiler [16] succeeded to create\noriginal 2D patterns of polystyrene microspheres and silica nanoparticles through template\nrecognition processes using chemically pre-patterned substrates (lithographically modified\nsubstrates). Moreover, Thill [12] demonstrated that the adhesion force between \u03b1-Al2 O3 particles and a mica substrate can overcome the effects of lateral capillary interactions and stick\nthe particles on the surface of the substrate. The adhesion force (L) which appears when a\nparticle is deposited on the surface of a substrate might induce friction forces (F ) through\nthe classical Amontons' law [13], F = \u03bcL, where \u03bc is a friction coefficient. In particular, Hu\n[14] demonstrated that low friction forces between silica nanoparticles (d50 = 25nm) moving\non a silicon substrate are a key point to reach a well distributed self-ordered 2D particles\nclose-packings on the surface of the substrate at the end of drying.\nHowever, despite many experimental results on particles self-organisation, few theoretical\nmodels have been reported in the literature to describe dynamically the physical phenomena\noccurring during the drying of a thin liquid film containing micrometric particles. Popov\ndescribed the drying stage of a colloidal suspension droplet on a substrate through a complete\n2\n\n\fanalytical model [17], Reyes studied the geometrical properties of polymer colloidal particles\nmonolayers synthesized from the drying of a colloidal suspension by a Monte Carlo approach\n[18] and J\u00e1rai-Szab\u00f3 proposed a spring-block stick-slip model to reveal the self-ordering\ndynamics of polystyrene nanoparticles on a glass substrate [19]. But, to the best of our\nknowledge, there is no simple dynamic model able to describe the physical events occurring\nduring the drying of a thin liquid film containing nanometric or micrometric particles.\nThus, the aim of our study is to propose a numerical model, which allows one to simulate\nthe physical events occurring during the drying of a thin liquid film containing micrometric\nparticles, in order to characterize their distribution at the end of drying. The thin liquid film\nis horizontally dried on a substrate which is either flat or indented to create linear stripes\non its surface. The stripes are made in such a way that a rough area is also created on\nthe border of one side of each stripe. By this way, we will point out the critical effects of\nlateral capillary forces and particles-substrate friction forces on the self-organization process\nof particles with regard to a rough area at the top of the substrate and a stripe in the\nsubstrate. Therefore, we have developed a molecular dynamic algorithm which allows one\nto calculate the trajectories of the particles by solving the Newton's equation of motion\nacross time during drying until the thin film is fully dried. Moreover, we present a simple\nexperimental procedure to illustrate the drying of a thin film on a substrate either flat or\nindented.\nThe first section of the paper deals with the experimental procedure while the second one\ndescribes the physical model involves in molecular dynamic calculations. The third section\npresents the numerical results which are discussed in the light of experimental data.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL APPROACH\nA.\n\nSynthesis of micrometric particles patterns\n\nThe particles are faceted diamond monocrystals with an average diameter of 10 \u03bcm. The\nexperimental suspension is made from 2 ml of a commercial water based diamond suspension\nBuehler Metadi r diluted in 40 ml of distilled water. The number of particles per unit volume\nin this suspension is estimated to 107 particles for 1cm3 of liquid. We used amorphous glass\nsubstrates (1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 0.1cm3 ) with an optical quality surface. The substrate is either fully flat\n\n3\n\n\for locally indented with a diamond pen to create linear stripes on its surface. The action of\nthe diamond pen at the surface of the substrate leads to the formation of a rough surface\non one side of the stripe. The figure 1 gives a schematic description of the substrate next to\nthe stripe. Afterwards, the substrates are washed in soapy water before being cleaned under\nultrasonic vibrations in water/acetone and water/ethanol bathes.\nThe glass substrate, either flat or indented, is deposited in a container filled with 600\n\u03bcL of the suspension. Then this system is deposited in a drying oven which temperature\nis constant and equal to 60o C. The container is removed from the drying oven when the\nsuspension is fully dried.\n\nB.\n\nOptical microscopy analysis of the patterns\n\nWe used an optical microscope in transmission mode to observe the micrometric particles\ndistribution on the surface of the substrate after drying. Figure 2 is an image of a micrometric\nparticles collection obtained after drying of the suspension on a flat substrate. One can see\nthat the particles are distributed over the whole surface of the substrate. This picture clearly\nshows particles which are either isolated or aggregated in small clusters or interconnected\ninto linear patterns. The figure 3 is also a snapshot of a micrometric particles collection\nobtained after drying but in the case where the substrate is indented; the width of the stripe\nis about 3 times the average diameter of the particles. This picture shows that there is a\ndramatic effect of the rough edge of the stripe on the distribution of the particles. We do\nnot observe small clusters or linear patterns any more but some single particles distributed\naround a dense band of interconnected particles located along one side of the stripe. The\nwidth of this band is estimated to be equal to 4-5 times the average diameter of the particles.\nOn one hand, figure 2 allows us to think that at the end of the drying process (when\nthe thickness of the film is lower than the average diameter of the particles), the thin liquid\nfilm breaks into several non-spherical drops more or less interconnected [20]. Afterwards,\nthe particles which are located in a liquid drop are submitted to a local confinement due\nto lateral capillary forces. They aggregate with their nearest neighbors which leads to the\nformation of small clusters or linear patterns when the surface of the substrate is flat.\nOn the other hand, one can see a dense band of particles located along the stripe in the\nfigure 3. One can see that the aggregation of the particles is not symmetric with regard\n4\n\n\fto the stripe. Thus, we can not explain this tendency only through the action of lateral\ncapillary forces as those interactions are isotropic. Therefore, friction forces, induced by the\nhigher roughness on one side of the stripe may be responsible for the particles preferential\nlocation. Moreover, there are not any particles inside the stripe. Indeed, as the thin liquid\nfilm is dried on the top of the substrate but not inside the stripe, the particles located\nnext to the stripe are submitted to stronger capillary interactions than the particles located\ninside the stripe. Therefore, the particles do not stay inside the stripe but are preferentially\ntrapped on the rough band next to the stripe where the action of friction forces is enhanced\nby the action of lateral capillary forces.\n\nIII.\nA.\n\nNUMERICAL SIMULATION\nModel of thin liquid film and substrates\n\nThe previous section introduced the dramatic effect of the stripes on the distribution of\nthe particles at the surface of the substrate after drying. We propose a physical model to\nunderstand this difference. We used molecular dynamic simulations at constant temperature\n(333K - 60o C) to solve Newton's equation of motion in order to simulate the trajectories of\nthe particles as a function of time until the thin liquid film is fully dried. The integration\ntime step is \u2206t = 10-10s.\nA numerical thin liquid film is simulated with a collection of N = 200 spherical particles\nof equal diameter d = 10\u03bcm and mass m randomly distributed in a box of length 50d in\nthe x and y axis and height h = d on the z axis at the beginning of the calculation process.\nWe suppose that there is no displacement in the z direction, the particles are trapped in\na 2D thin liquid film and move at the surface of the substrate in the x and y directions.\nOne can note that spherical particles can either slide or roll or both at the surface of the\nsubstrate. However, it is clear that the faceted experimental particles slide on the surface\nof the substrate. Therefore we assume that the virtual spherical particles slide without\nrolling at the surface of the substrate, which induces particles-substrate friction forces. In\norder to simulate the effect of drying, the height h of the air-liquid interface is decreased\nlinearly at each step from h = d at the beginning to h = 0 at the end of the calculation\nprocess. Therefore, the air-liquid and liquid-solid interfaces of the film are characterized\n\n5\n\n\fby the (x,y,h) and (x,y,0) planes respectively. Whatever the kind of substrate which is\nconsidered, we applied periodic boundary conditions in the x and y directions.\nThe thin liquid film is either dried on a fully flat substrate or on a substrate indented.\nIn that case we introduce the effect of the stripe. The defect (i.e. the stripe), located at the\ncenter of the substrate, is represented by a rectangular band of width 3d on the x axis, length\n50d on the y axis and depth 3d on the z axis. The particles located in this defect are allowed\nto move in the three directions of space. As in experiments, the enhanced roughness is only\navailable along the left side of the stripe. Therefore, we propose to simulate the enhanced\nroughness on a border of the stripe by a friction force induced by a higher local roughness\nwith regard to the other parts of the substrate. In order to simulate this roughening effect\non one side of the stripe, we introduce an area of width 5d on the x axis and length 50d on\nthe y axis, located on the border of the left side of the stripe at the top of the substrate,\nwith a higher roughness than on the other parts of the substrate.\nWhatever the kind of substrate, the computation process is stopped when h = 0 which\nimplies that the particles located in a stripe are still surrounded by the liquid medium. We\ndo not simulate the drying of the stripe because this stage has no effects on the particles\ndistribution characteristics at the surface of the substrate.\n\nB.\n\nComputation of the forces involved in the drying process\n\nAs the particles are very small, we suppose that the effect of weight on their movement\ncan be neglected in the whole calculation process.\nThe particles which are in thermal equilibrium with the liquid medium are submitted\nto Brownian motion which is linked to a viscous drag force according to the fluctuationdissipation theorem. Those forces are valid for particles moving at the surface of a substrate\nor inside a stripe. The Brownian motion is modelled through a Gaussian random force,\nuncorrelated neither in space nor in time, whose mean with regard to time is expressed with\nthe following expression:\nhfi b (t), fi b (t\u2032 )i = 2kB T \u03be\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 )\n\n(1)\n\nwhere kB is the Boltzmann's constant, T the absolute temperature and \u03be (kg.s-1 ) a friction\ncoefficient which is related to the physical parameters of the system, \u03be = 3\u03c0d\u03b7, with \u03b7\n6\n\n\f(kg.m-1 .s-1 ) the dynamic viscosity of the liquid medium. The last term, \u03b4, is the Dirac's\ndistribution function. We suppose that the liquid is pure water whose dynamic viscosity is\n\u03b7 = 0.5 \u00d7 103 kg.m-1.s-1 at 333K. In order to compute the Brownian motion, the Gaussian\nrandom force must be expressed through the formalism of Wiener:\nfi b (t)\u2206t =\n\np\n\n6\u03c0kB T d\u03b7\u2206W (t)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u2206W (t) is computed by a Gaussian random number as h\u2206W (t)i = 0 and\nh\u2206W (t)\u2206W (t\u2032 )i = \u2206t. The Brownian motion involves a viscous drag force which can\nbe formalized as follows:\nfi s (t) = \u2212\u03bevi (t) = \u22123\u03c0d\u03b7vi (t)\n\n(3)\n\nwith vi (t) is the velocity of the particle i at time t. The drying process induces the decreasing\nof the thickness of the thin liquid film and the particles located on a fully flat substrate or\noutside the stripe of an indented substrate are not immersed but surrounded by the liquid\nmedium. Consequently the Brownian motion and the viscous drag forces decrease (the\ncontact area between each particle and the liquid medium is lowered). We suppose, for the\nsake of simplicity, that the intensities of those forces decrease linearly at each step of the\ncalculation process which implies that d is replaced by h in equations (2) and (3).\nThe particles which are trapped in a two dimensional thin film of liquid are subjected\nto lateral capillary forces (those capillary forces are not relevant for particles located in\nthe depth of a stripe because they are surrounded by the liquid medium during the whole\ncalculation process). The lateral capillary forces are computed with the following expression\n[15]:\nfi c (r) = \u2212\u03c0\u03b3rc2 sin(\u03c6c )2\n\nd\n(r \u2212 d)2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b3 (N.m-1 ) is the surface tension of water \u03b3 = 73 \u00d7 10-3N.m-1 at 293K, rc the radius\nof the liquid-solid contact line and \u03c6c the mean slope angle at the meniscus at the contact\nline. Figure 4 presents a schematic description of the physical parameters involved in the\ncalculation of the lateral capillary interactions. The analytical expressions of rc and \u03c6c are\n[15]:\n1\n\nrc = (h(2R \u2212 h)) 2\nrc\n\u03c6c = arcsin( ) \u2212 \u03b1\nR\n7\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\n\fwhere R is the radius of the particle and \u03b1 the wetting angle at the three contact line.\nWe suppose that the particles are wetted by the liquid medium and we choose \u03b1 = 0.7rad\n( 40o ). The lateral capillary forces are spatially limited in the calculation process. Indeed,\nit is clear that the overlapping of the deformations induced by the presence of a particle is\nefficient only for its next neighbors. Therefore we propose to compute the lateral capillary\nforces with the following conditions:\nif\n\nr > 5d\n\nthen:\n\nfi c (r) = 0\nif\n\nr \u2264 5d\n\nif\n\nr > 1.1d\n\n(7)\nthen:\nthen:\n\nfi c (r) = \u2212\u03c0\u03c3rc2 sin(\u03c6c )2\nif\n\nr \u2264 1.1d\n\nd\n(r \u2212 d)2\n\n(8)\n\nd\n(1.1d \u2212 d)2\n\n(9)\n\nthen:\n\nfi c (r) = \u2212\u03c0\u03c3rc2 sin(\u03c6c )2\n\nFinally, we consider the friction forces induced by the roughness of the substrate. As previously reported, we modelled the faceted particles of the real system by spherical particles\nin the virtual system which slide at the surface of the substrate. It is clear that the face\nof a real particle which is in contact with the surface of the substrate is responsible for\nthe development of particle-substrate friction forces. Thus, to be consistent with the real\nsystem, the virtual particles are submitted to friction forces. Therefore, at the end of each\ncalculation step, the total interaction supported by a virtual particle is expressed as:\nfi t (r, t) = (1 \u2212 \u03b8)(fi b (t) + fi s (t) + fi c (r))\n\n(10)\n\nwith \u03b8 an dimensionless friction coefficient. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that if the\nparticle moves at the surface of a fully flat substrate or out of the rough area of an indented\nsubstrate \u03b8 = 0, whereas if the particle is located on the rough part of an indented substrate,\n\u03b8 = 0.9. We chose a very high friction coefficient to point out clearly the effects of friction\nforces on the particles distribution between a flat and an indented substrate.\n\n8\n\n\fIV.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL AND NUMERICAL RESULTS: ANALYSIS AND DISCUS-\n\nSION\n\nFigure 5 is a numerical particles distribution which corresponds to the final state of a\nnumerical thin liquid film dried on a fully flat substrate whereas figure 6 presents a numerical\nparticles distribution associated to an indented substrate. One can clearly see that the\ncalculations demonstrate a good qualitative agreement with experimental data. Indeed,\nsimilarly to figure 2, linear patterns, small clusters and even single numerical particles are\nobserved in figure 5. Moreover, like in figure 3, a dense band of numerical particles located\non the rough part of the substrate is observed in figure 6. Therefore, whatever the kind of\nsubstrate, the physical model introduced in section 3 is consistent to describe the evolution\nof the system until the thin liquid film is fully dried.\nOn the one hand, the numerical results point out that the roughness effects are enhanced\nby the lateral capillary forces at the end of the drying process. Indeed, as previously mentioned, the last stage of drying of a thin liquid film on a perfect substrate leads to the\nformation of drops more or less interconnected which are responsible for the small patterns\nof particles. This phenomenon is modelled in the numerical approach through the action\nof the lateral capillary interactions which are spatially limited. Consequently, the numerical particles can only interact with their nearest neighbors to form small clusters or linear\npatterns at the surface of the substrate.\nOn the other hand, the numerical results demonstrate that the local roughness of the\nsubstrate and the friction forces are relevant to simulate the confinement effect close to the\nstripe. Whatever the case (real or virtual system), the lateral capillary interactions stick\nthe particles with their very next neighbors. In the case of a substrate with linear stripe, we\ndemonstrate that the confinement effect along one side of the stripe is physically induced\nby friction forces.\nThe figure 7 shows the space correlation function of the particle distribution in real space.\nOne may see that for distances enclosed between 1 and 4, the density of presence of particles\nis larger in the case of an indented substrate (bottom) than in the case of a flat substrate\n(top). This mean that the particles are preferentially agglomerated in some location, in our\ncase a large number of particles are located on the left part the stripe. Moreover, one may see\nthat the density of presence in the bottom figure, (for abscissa lower than 50 corresponding\n9\n\n\fto an interparticle distance of 50), is the signature of presence of stripes in the y direction.\nThe fact that both distribution functions decrease after interparticle distance equal to 70\nis due to the computation of the correlation functions which does not take into account\nperiodic boundary conditions.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe showed that the effect of roughness and thus of friction is enhanced by the action of\nlateral capillary forces. By imprinting linear defects, where the roughness of the substrate is\nlarger, we obtained after drying of the thin liquid film linear stripes of micrometric particles.\nWe demonstrated that a rough surface at the top of a substrate is a better way than stripes\nto confine the particles. Experiments and molecular dynamic simulations are in good agreement. This experimental method is an easy way to obtain correlated patterns of faceted\nmicrometric particles.\nAcknowledgments The authors acknowledge T.Albaret for helping experimental images\nformat conversion.\n\n10\n\n\f[1] G.Kumaraswamy , A.M.Dibaj and F.Caruso , Langmuir 18 (2002) 4150\n[2] H.Fudouzi, J.
