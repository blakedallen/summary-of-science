Nicholson (Caltech Alumni)\nemail: knchlsn@alumni.caltech.edu\nAbstract\nExtreme speed profiles, that are impossible to analyze correctly using the usual methods, are shown to\nbe easily handled using the methods developed previously by Nicholson (astro-ph / 0006330). These\nprofiles are constant orbital speeds with sharp and smooth ramps at the origin, and constant angular\nvelocity with speeds increasing linearly to the galaxy rim. Also an example using measured data for a\nreal galaxy is shown for NGC 3198. A new format is presented to show results in dimensionless form,\nthat includes a way to show SMD results so that they are easily compared. Based on repeated trials for\naccuracy, the rod representing the mass of a fundamental segment is now placed at 0.575 *dr at the center\nring of a galaxy.\nIntroduction\nThe orbital speeds of many thin-disk galaxies, after rising at the center, are nearly constant to large\nradii. Analysts have had to invent some unusual methods to find a reasonable mass distribution that could\ncause these speeds. Most prominent of these methods is the dark-matter halo, a distribution of spherical\nhalos with masses that adjust the speeds where needed. These halos cannot be detected in any physical\nway and their existence is only implied by their need to make the mathematics work using \"Newtonian\nmechanics.\" Newton's law has been checked by many applications, but it is not applied correctly there.\nA new field of astro-physics has been created in an attempt to find the \"dark matter\" that fills these halos,\nso far with no success.\nIn spite of the great popularity of these halos, I feel they probably don't exist. The emperor has no\nclothes. Nearly all the matter in a galaxy lies within the detectable (by any means) thin-disk envelope.\nLight has no effect on dynamic results and it is a fair bet that most of the galaxies in the universe are small\nand \"dark\" in the traditional sense. But this is not really mysterious dark matter.\nAnother scheme invented in an attempt to avoid the halos is the Modified Newtonian method, where\nthe gravitational constant is adjusted with distance. Unfortunately most of these schemes are based on the\nassumption that the mass of all matter inside the radius of a measured speed is determined by that speed,\nand the effects of matter outside that radius on that inside, are zero. This assumption is false except for\nspheres, and Newton's method must be applied by integrating the gravitational effects of ALL parts of the\ngalaxy on a \"test mass\" at a given radius, to find the speed there.\n1. Method\nUsing the equations as developed by Nicholson (2000), a fixed thickness distribution is assumed for\nthe galaxy, a starting value is used for density, and the speed profile computed. The speed errors\n(measured minus computed) at each of the ring outer radii are then used to correct the densities of the\nrings and the process repeated until all speed errors are less than vmax *1E-6.\n\n\f2\n. If no better thickness distribution is known, the Milky Way thickness shape is used. Zero thickness\ncannot be used because that causes low values for both SMD and total mass. Also zero thickness leads to\ndivision by zero in the computing. The effects of thickness have been previously shown by Nicholson.\nThe digital form of the equation for orbital speed at the test mass radius rt is:\nNr 180\nG ddm\n(rt \u2212 rr cos( th ))\nv 2 = (pytks )2 \u2022 rt \u2022 \u2211 2 \u2211\n\u2022\n2\n2\nc2\n1\n1 c + ( h / 2)\nwhere c2 = (rr sin( th ))2 + (rt \u2212 rr cos( th ))2 , pc^2\nddm = mass of the fundamental segment, rho * r * dth * dr * h, msuns\ndth = 1 degree\nG = gravitational constant, 4.498E-15 pc^3/(msuns/yr^2)\nh = galaxy thickness at radius r, pcs\nNr = number of rings ( 30 for all cases here except Milky Way has 20)\npytks = 9.778E5 (kms/sec)/(pys/yr)\nr = radius to centerline of ring, pcs\nrho = density, msuns/pc^3\nrm = radius to outer edge of ring, pcs\nrr = radius to rod used to represent fundamental segment mass, pcs\n= rm -dr / 2 * (rm - 0.575 * dr) / (rm - dr / 2)\nrt = radius to test mass, pcs\nv = orbital speed of test mass, kms/sec\n2. Results\nAll results are given in dimensionless form so that galaxies of different sizes are directly comparable\nfor dynamic effects. A new parameter, a dimensionless form of SMD, allows easy comparison for\ndifferent galaxies. Data are given on each plot allowing reduction to dimensioned data if desired.\nDimensionless forms are:\nmd = m / mtot\nrd = r / rmax\nrhod = rho / rhoav\nrhoav = mtot / voltot, msuns / pc^3\nvd = v / vkrim\nvkrim = Kepler result at the rim, sqr (G * mtot / rmax) * pytks, kms/sec\nrSMDd = rd * SMD / SMDav\nSMDav = mtot / (pi * rmax^2), msuns / pc^2\nThe Milky Way shape was obtained from a picture in a Bok article (1981), and seems to give\nreasonable results for densities.\n\nthen\n\nhd = 0.1288*sqr(1 - (rd/0.0644)^2) , for rd < 0.0322 ,\nhd = 0.11158*exp ( - 2.315*(rd - 0.0322)) , for rd < 0.2857 ,\n\n\f3\nthen hd = 0.0620 - 0.0727 * (rd - 0.2857)\nwhere hd = h / rmax\nAll examples use the Milky Way galaxy shape, except for that having constant angular velocity, which\nuses constant thickness. When the thickness is reasonably correct, the mass distribution (md vs rd) and\nSMD depend slightly on the thickness selection if hd is \"small\" ( ie. thin disk), and density has the\nlargest errors. Fairly large errors and computing problems result if the thickness is assumed to be zero.\nDensity of course is inversely proportional to the galaxy thickness assumed, so the errors there can be of\norder 25%. Better data are needed for thickness distributions to improve density output. As experience\naccumulates, the thickness distributions for each galaxy considered will become more accurate.\nThe constant-speed example of figure 1, using a sharp transition, results in a spike in the rSMD curve\nat the transition. The slope of that curve near the origin is proportional to SMD at the center. All examples\nbecome asymptotic to the Kepler result beyond the rim as they should. No other methods have so far\nshown results beyond the rim, although some could be extended to that region. Because the speed errors\nare so small, the \"measured\" and computed speeds are essentially identical. These figures can be enlarged\neasily in PDF. For this trial rmax = 12000 pcs.\n\nThis spike is eased using a smooth transition as in figure 2. Note rmax changes from 12000 to 18000.\n\n\f4\n\nNGC 3198, has almost constant rotational speeds from 6 to 30 kpcs and the results (figure 3) are\nsimilar to those of figures 1 and 2, except for the bumpiness caused by the variations in measured speeds.\nThe speeds used are from figure 10-2 of Binney and Tremaine. Rmax is now 30000.\n\nWhen plotted together in figure 4, the results of figures 1, 2, 3 show the similarities and differences.\n\nThis next \"galaxy\" does not seem to occur naturally, but there is no dynamic reason for it not to exist.\nIt is a constant-thickness disk with constant angular velocity. That is, the speeds are proportional to\nradius, and no shear can occur between rings. It is essentially a solid flywheel. There appears to be no\nknown analytic solution for the mass distribution, but using Nicholson's method, the SMD and density are\neasily obtained (figure 5). The curves show the SMD and density are constant near the center, falling off\n\n\f5\nto small values near the rim. A result using constant density and solving for thickness would have a\nslightly different rSMD curve.\n\n3. Conclusions\nNewton's law needs no correction to find galaxy mass distributions from orbital speeds.\nGiven reasonable estimates of galaxy dimensions, including thickness, good values for the mass,\nSMD, and density distributions are easily found from the orbital speed profiles.\nThere is no need for spherical dark-matter halos to find a mass distribution to match the orbital apeed\nprofiles for thin disks, and these halos probably don't exist.\nReferences\nBinney, J. and Tremaine, S. 1987, Galactic Dynamics (book, Princeton University Press)\nBok, R.J., The Milky Way Galaxy, Scientific American, March 1981\nNicholson, K.
