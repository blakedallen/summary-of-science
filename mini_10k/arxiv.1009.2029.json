Introduction\nThis work is a result of interaction of two circles of ideas. The first one deals with\na certain class of random growth models in two space dimensions [War07], [Nor10],\n[BF08+], [BG09], [BGR09+], [BK10] [Bor10+], while the second one addresses constructing and analyzing stochastic dynamics on spaces of point configurations with\ndistinguished invariant measures that are often given by, or closely related to, determinantal point processes [BO06a], [BO06b], [BO09], [Ols10], [Ols10+].\nOur main result is a construction of a Feller Markov process that preserves the\nso-called zw-measure on the (infinite-dimensional) space \u03a9 of extreme characters\n\n\fMARKOV PROCESSES . . .\n\n3\n\nof the infinite-dimensional unitary group U(\u221e). The four-parameter family of zwmeasures arises naturally in a problem of harmonic analysis on U(\u221e) as the decomposing measures for a distinguished family of characters [Ols03]. A zw-measure\ngives rise to a determinantal point process on the real line with two punctures, and\nthe corresponding correlation kernel is given in terms of the Gauss hypergeometric\nfunction [BO05a]. Such point processes degenerate, via suitable limits and/or specializations, to essentially all known one-dimensional determinantal processes with\ncorrelation kernels expressible through classical special functions.\nThe problem of constructing a Markov process that preserves a given determinantal point process with infinite point configurations has been addressed in [Spo87],\n[KT10], [Osa09+] for the sine process, in [KT09] for the Airy process, and in [Ols10+]\nfor the Whittaker process describing the z-measures from the harmonic analysis on\nthe infinite symmetric group.\nOur approach to constructing the infinite-dimensional stochastic dynamics differs\nfrom the ones used in previous papers. We employ the fact (of representation theoretic origin) that the probability measures on \u03a9 are in one-to-one correspondence\nwith central or Gibbs measures on infinite Gelfand-Tsetlin schemes that can also be\nviewed as stepped surfaces or lozenge tilings of a half-plane. The projections of a\nzw-measure to suitably defined slices of the infinite schemes yield orthogonal polynomial ensembles with weight functions corresponding to hypergeometric Askey-Lesky\northogonal polynomials.\nThese orthogonal polynomials are eigenfunctions for a birth and death process\non Z with quadratic jump rates; a standard argument then shows that the Ndimensional Askey-Lesky orthogonal polynomial ensemble is preserved by a Doob's\nh-transform of N independent birth and death processes.\nWe further show that the Markov processes on the slices are consistent with respect to stochastic projections of the Nth slice to the (N \u22121)st one (these projections\nare uniquely determined by the Gibbs property). This consistency is in no way obvious, and we do not have a conceptual explanation for it. However, it turns out to\nbe essentially sufficient for defining the corresponding Markov process on \u03a9.\nWe do a bit more - using a continuous time analog of the general formalism of\n[BF08+] (which was based on an idea from [DF90]), we construct a Markov process\non Gelfand-Tsetlin schemes that preserves the class of central (=Gibbs) measures\nand that induces the same Markov process on \u03a9.\nWe now proceed to a more detailed description of our work.\n\n1.1. Gelfand-Tsetlin graph and its boundary. Following [Wey39], for N \u2265 1\ndefine a signature of length N as an N-tuple of nonincreasing integers \u03bb = (\u03bb1 \u2265\n* * * \u2265 \u03bbN ), and denote by GTN the set of all such signatures. Elements of GTN\nparameterize irreducible representations of U(N) or GL(N, C), and they are often\ncalled highest weights.\n\n\f4\n\nALEXEI BORODIN AND GRIGORI OLSHANSKI\n\nFor \u03bb \u2208 GTN and \u03bd \u2208 GTN +1 , we say that \u03bb \u227a \u03bd if \u03bdj+1 \u2264 \u03bbj \u2264 \u03bdj for all\nmeaningful values of indices. These inequalities are well-known to be equivalent\nto the condition that the restriction of the \u03bd-representation of U(N + 1) to U(N)\ncontains a \u03bb-component.\nF\nSet GT = N \u22651 GTN , and equip GT with edges by joining \u03bb and \u03bd iff \u03bb \u227a \u03bd or\n\u03bd \u227a \u03bb. This turns GT into a graph that we call the Gelfand-Tsetlin graph. A path\nof length M \u2208 {1, 2, . . . } \u222a {\u221e} in GT is a length M sequence\n\u03bb(1) \u227a \u03bb(2) \u227a . . . ,\n\n\u03bb(j) \u2208 GTj .\n\n\b (j)\nEquivalently, such a path can be viewed as an array of numbers \u03bbi\nsatisfying\n(j+1)\n(j)\n(j+1)\nthe inequalities \u03bbi+1 \u2264 \u03bbi \u2264 \u03bbi\n; it is also called a Gelfand-Tsetlin scheme. An\ninterpretation of paths in GT in terms of lozenge tilings or stepped surfaces can be\nfound in the introduction to [BF08+].\nThe Gelfand-Tsetlin schemes of length N parameterize basis vectors in the GelfandTsetlin basis of the irreducible representation of U(N) corresponding to \u03bb(N ) , cf.\n[Zhe70]. Denote by DimN \u03bb the number of such schemes with \u03bb(N ) = \u03bb; this is also\nthe dimension of the irreducible representation of U(N) corresponding to \u03bb. It is\nessentially equal to the Vandermonde determinant in shifted coordinates of \u03bb:\nY\nDimN (\u03bb) = constN\n(\u03bbi \u2212 i \u2212 \u03bbj + j).\n1\u2264i<j\u2264N\n\nA probability measure on infinite paths in GT is called central (or Gibbs) if any\ntwo finite paths with the same top end are equiprobable, cf. [Ker03]. Let PN be\nthe projection of such a measure to \u03bb(N ) \u2208 GTN . Centrality is easily seen to be\n+1\nequivalent to the relation \u03bcN = \u03bcN +1 \u039bN\n, N \u2265 1, where \u03bcN and \u03bcN +1 are viewed\nN\nas row-vectors with coordinates {\u03bcN (\u03bb)}\u03bb\u2208GTN and {\u03bcN +1 (\u03bd)}\u03bd\u2208GTN+1 , and\n+1\n\u039bN\n(\u03bd, \u03bb) =\nN\n\nDimN (\u03bb)\n1\u03bb\u227a\u03bd ,\nDimN (\u03bd)\n\n\u03bb \u2208 GTN , \u03bd \u2208 GTN +1 ,\n\n(1.1)\n\nis the stochastic matrix of cotransition probabilities. There is a one-to-one correspondence between central measures on GT and characters of U(\u221e) (equivalently, equivalence classes of unitary spherical representations of the Gelfand pair\n(U(\u221e) \u00d7 U(\u221e), diag U(\u221e))), see [Ols03].\nAs shown in [Ols03], see also [Voi76], [VK82], [OO98], the space of all central\nprobability measures is isomorphic to the space of all probability measures on the\nset \u03a9 \u2282 R4\u221e+2\nconsisting of the sextuples \u03c9 = (\u03b1+ , \u03b2 + , \u03b1\u2212 , \u03b2 \u2212 , \u03b4 + , \u03b4 \u2212 ) \u2208 R4\u221e+2\n+\n+\nsatisfying the conditions\n\u03b1\u00b1 = (\u03b11\u00b1 \u2265 \u03b12\u00b1 \u2265 * * * \u2265 0), \u03b2 \u00b1 = (\u03b21\u00b1 \u2265 \u03b22\u00b1 \u2265 * * * \u2265 0),\n\u221e\nX\n(\u03b1i\u00b1 + \u03b2i\u00b1 ) \u2264 \u03b4 \u00b1 ,\n\u03b21+ + \u03b21\u2212 \u2264 1.\ni=1\n\n\u03b4 \u00b1 \u2265 0,\n\n\fMARKOV PROCESSES . . .\n\n5\n\nThe set \u03a9 is called the boundary of GT; its points parameterize the extreme\ncharacters of U(\u221e). The map from central measures on GT to measures on \u03a9\namounts to certain asymptotic relations described in Subsection 9.1 below.\n1.2. zw-measures. Let z, z \u2032 , w, w \u2032 be four complex parameters such that\n(z + k)(z \u2032 + k) > 0\n\nand\n\n(w + k)(w \u2032 + k) > 0\n\nfor any\n\nk\u2208Z\n\n(1.2)\n\nand\nz + z \u2032 + w + w \u2032 > \u22121\n\n(1.3)\n\n(note that (1.2) implies that z + z \u2032 and w + w \u2032 are real). For N \u2265 1, define a\nprobability measure on GTN by (below li = \u03bbi + N \u2212 i)\nMz,z,w,w\u2032|N (\u03bb) = constN\n\nY\n\n(li \u2212 lj )\n\n1\u2264i<j\u2264N\n\n2\n\nN\nY\n\nWz,z \u2032,w,w\u2032 (li ),\n\n(1.4)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere\nWz,z \u2032 ,w,w\u2032 (x) =\n\n1\n.\n\u0393(z + N \u2212 x)\u0393(z \u2032 + N \u2212 x)\u0393(w + 1 + x)\u0393(w \u2032 + 1 + x)\n\nWe call it the Nth level zw-measure. It is the N-point orthogonal polynomial\nensemble with weight W ( * ), see e.g. [Kon05] and references therein for general\ninformation on such ensembles.\nOne can show that the finite level zw-measures are consistent:\nFor any N \u2265 1,\n\b\nN +1\nMz,z \u2032 ,w,w\u2032|N = Mz,z \u2032 ,w,w\u2032|N +1 \u039bN . Therefore, the collection Mz,z \u2032,w,w\u2032|N N \u22651 defines\na central measure on the paths in GT and a character of U(\u221e). For z \u2032 = z\u0304, w \u2032 = w\u0304,\nthis character corresponds to a remarkable substitute for the nonexisting regular\nrepresentation of U(\u221e), see [Ols03] for details.\nThe corresponding measure Mz,z \u2032 ,w,w\u2032 on \u03a9 is called the spectral zw-measure. If\n\u03c9 = (\u03b1\u00b1 , \u03b2 \u00b1 , \u03b4 \u00b1 ) \u2208 \u03a9 is distributed according to Mz,z \u2032 ,w,w\u2032 then the random point\nprocess generated by the coordinates\n\b1\n\u221e\n+ \u03b1i+ , 21 \u2212 \u03b2i+ , \u2212 21 + \u03b2i\u2212 , \u2212 12 \u2212 \u03b1i\u2212 i=1\n2\nis determinantal, see [BO05a], [BO05b] for details.\n\n1.3. Doob's transforms of N-fold products of birth and death processes.\nIt is not hard to show that the first level zw-measure Mz,z \u2032 ,w,w\u2032|1 on GT1 = Z is the\nsymmetrizing measure for the bilateral birth and death process that from a point\nx \u2208 Z jumps to the right with intensity (x \u2212 u)(x \u2212 u\u2032 ) and jumps to the left with\nintensity (x + v)(x + v \u2032 ), where (u, u\u2032, v, v \u2032) = (z, z \u2032 , w, w \u2032). Denote by D = Du,u\u2032,v,v\u2032\nthe corresponding matrix of transition rates.\n\n\f6\n\nALEXEI BORODIN AND GRIGORI OLSHANSKI\n\nMore generally, we show that the Nth level zw-measure (1.4) is the symmetrizing\nmeasure for a continuous time Markov chain on GTN with transition rates\nDimN (\u03bd) \u0010\n(N )\nD(l1 , n1 )1{li =ni ,i6=1} + D(l2 , n2 )1{li =ni ,i6=2} + . . .\nD (\u03bb, \u03bd) =\nDimN (\u03bb)\n\u0011\n+ D(lN , nN )1{li =ni ,i6=N } \u2212 dN * 1\u03bb=\u03bd (1.5)\n\nwhere lj = \u03bbj + N \u2212 j, nj = \u03bdj + N \u2212 j, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 N, dN is a suitable constant, and\nwe take (u, u\u2032, v, v \u2032) = (z + N \u2212 1, z \u2032 + N \u2212 1, w, w \u2032) in the definition of D.\nObserve that D (N ) can be viewed as a version of Doob's h-transform of N copies\nof the Markov chain defined by D with h( * ) = DimN ( * ). Note that in our case,\nDimN ( * ) is an eigenfunction of the corresponding matrix of transition rates with a\nnonzero eigenvalue.\nFor any N \u2265 1, let (PN (t))t\u22650 be the Markov semigroup corresponding to the\nmatrix D (N ) of transition rates on GTN (we show that (PN (t))t\u22650 is uniquely defined\nand it possesses the Feller property). The key fact that we prove is the consistency\n(or commutativity) relation\n+1\n+1\nPN +1 (t)\u039bN\n= \u039bN\nPN (t),\nN\nN\n\nt \u2265 0,\n\nN \u2265 1.\n\nAlthough this relation looks natural, we have no a priori reason to expect it to\nhold, and we verify it by a brute force computational argument.\n1.4. Main result. We prove that for any (z, z \u2032 , w, w \u2032) \u2208 C4 subject to (1.2)-(1.3),\nthere exists a unique Markov semigroup (P (t))t\u22650 on \u03a9 that preserves the spectral\nzw-measure Mz,z \u2032 ,w,w\u2032 , and whose trace on GTN coincides with Doob's transforms\n(PN (t))t\u22650 introduced above. Moreover, the semigroup (P (t))t\u22650 is Feller (it preserves C0 (\u03a9), the Banach space of continuous functions vanishing at infinity; note\nthat the space \u03a9 is locally compact).\nBy general theory, see e.g. [EK86, IV.2.7], this means that for any probability\nmeasure \u03bc on \u03a9, there exists a Markov process on \u03a9 corresponding to (P (t))t\u22650 with\ninitial distribution \u03bc and c\u00e0dl\u00e0g sample paths. We also show that Mz,z \u2032,w,w\u2032 is the\nunique invariant measure for this Markov process.\n1.5. Markov process on Gelfand-Tsetlin schemes. Via the correspondence between the probability measures on \u03a9 and central measures on paths in GT, the\nsemigroup (P (t))t\u22650 defines a Markov evolution of central measures. It is natural to\nask if there exists a Markov process on all probability measures on paths in GT that\nagrees with the one we have when restricted to the central measures. We construct\none such\nprocess; let us describe its transition rates.\n\b (j)\nLet \u03bbi\nbe a starting Gelfand-Tsetlin scheme. Then\n(k)\n\u2022 Each coordinate \u03bbi tries to jump to the right by 1 with rate\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(\u03bbi \u2212 i \u2212 z + 1)(\u03bbi \u2212 i \u2212 z \u2032 + 1)\n\n\fMARKOV PROCESSES . . .\n\n7\n\nand to the left by 1 with rate\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(\u03bbi + k \u2212 i + w)(\u03bbi + k \u2212 i + w \u2032 ),\nindependently of other coordinates.\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k\u22121)\n\n\u2022 If the \u03bbi -clock of the right jump rings but \u03bbi = \u03bbi\u22121 , the jump is blocked. If\n(k)\n(k\u22121)\nits left clock rings but \u03bbi = \u03bbi\n, the jump is also blocked. (If any of the two jumps\nwere allowed then the resulting set of coordinates would not have corresponded to\na path in GT.)\n(k)\n\n\u2022 If the right \u03bbi -clock rings and there is no blocking, we find the greatest number\n(j)\n(k)\nl \u2265 k such that \u03bbi = \u03bbi for j = k, k + 1, . . . , l, and move all the coordinates\n(j)\n(k)\n(k)\n{\u03bbi }lj=k to the right by one. Given the change \u03bbi 7\u2192 \u03bbi + 1, this is the minimal\nmodification of the initial Gelfand-Tsetlin scheme that preserves interlacing.\n(k)\n\n\u2022 If the left \u03bbi -clock rings and there is no blocking, we find the greatest number\n(j)\n(k)\nl \u2265 k such that \u03bbi+j\u2212k = \u03bbi for j = k, k + 1, . . . , l, and move all the coordinates\n(j)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n{\u03bbi+j\u2212k }lj=k to the left by one. Again, given the change \u03bbi 7\u2192 \u03bbi \u2212 1, this is the\nminimal modification of the set of coordinates that preserves interlacing.\n(k)\nSince the update rule for each coordinate \u03bbi typically depends only on a few\nsurrounding coordinates, one can argue that we have a model of local random growth.\nIt should be compared to the models treated in [BF08+], [BK10], where a similar\nblock-push mechanism was considered with constant jumps rates, and in [Bor10+],\nwhere the jump rates were also dependent on the location and numbering of the\ncoordinates.\nThe key new feature of the Markov process above is the absence of the limit\nshape phenomenon. Often taken for granted in local growth models, it is simply\nnonexistent here.\n(j)\nThis fact becomes more apparent if we restrict ourselves to coordinates {\u03bb1 }j\u22651\nonly. The evolution of this set of coordinates is also Markov, and it represents\na kind of an exclusion process. Our results imply that this process has a unique\nequilibrium measure. Moreover, with respect to this measure, the asymptotic density\n(j)\nlimj\u2192\u221e \u03bb1 /j is well-defined and random. It changes over time, and its distribution\nis given by a solution to the classical Painlev\u00e9 VI (second order nonlinear) differential\nequation, cf. [BD02].\n1.6. Analytic continuation viewpoint. We have so far required the parameters\n(z, z \u2032 , w, w \u2032) to satisfy (1.2) and (1.3). However, all the results would hold if (1.2) is\nreplaced by more general conditions, see [Ols03] for a precise description, with the\nonly difference being that the state spaces for our Markov processes would become\nsmaller. In particular, if we choose\nz = k \u2208 Z\u22650 ,\n\nz \u2032 = k + a \u2212 1,\n\nw = l \u2208 Z\u22650 ,\n\nw \u2032 = l + b \u2212 1,\n\na, b > 0,\n\n\f8\n\nALEXEI BORODIN AND GRIGORI OLSHANSKI\n(j)\n\nthen we have to restrict ourselves to Gelfand-Tsetlin schemes with \u2212l \u2264 \u03bbi \u2264 k for\nall i, j \u2265 1. As the result, there are only k + l nontrivial parameters remaining on\nthe boundary, and (P (t))t\u22650 turns into a finite-dimensional diffusion with an explicit\nsecond order differential operator as its generator. The equilibrium distribution (i.e.\nthe spectral zw-measure) becomes the (k + l)-point Jacobi orthogonal polynomial\nensemble. See Subsection 10.1 for details.\nOne can thus think of our construction as of an analytic continuation in parameters (k, l, a, b) of a very well understood finite-dimensional diffusion. This point of\nview can be very fruitful: In [Ols10+] it was heavily exploited in the construction\nand analysis of the Markov process preserving the spectral z-measure arising from\nrepresentation theory of the infinite symmetric group. In that case, the starting\npoint for analytic continuation was the Laguerre orthogonal polynomial ensemble\nand the corresponding diffusion, rather than the Jacobi one that we have here.\n1.7. Pregenerator. As our construction of the semigroup (P (t))t\u22650 is fairly inexplicit, it is tempting to look for its alternative definition, for example, via a generator.\nWe were able to find a countable set of 'coordinates' on \u03a9 such that the action of\nthe generator of (P (t))t\u22650 on polynomials in these coordinates is given by an explicit\nformal second order differential operator, see Subsection 10.2 below. However, it remains a challenge for us to derive properties of our Markov process (or its existence)\nfrom the resulting formula.\n1.8. Further questions. As explained in [Ols03], the slices GTN can be embedded\ninto the boundary so that as N \u2192 \u221e, their images form an increasingly fine grid in\n\u03a9. It is known that the Nth level zw-measures weakly converge to the spectral ones\nunder these embeddings. It would be desirable to prove a similar statement for the\nMarkov semigroups.\nVerifying semigroup convergence would pave the way to proving that the equilibrium Markov process on the boundary can also be described as a time-dependent\ndeterminantal point process. The fact that the dynamical correlation functions are\ndeterminantal on each GTN easily follows from known techniques, although deriving useful formulas for the correlation kernel is a separate task. Another possible\ncorollary of the semigroup convergence would be that the spectral zw-measure is a\nsymmetrizing (not just an invariant) measure for (P (t))t\u22650 .\nIt seems important to continue the study of the pregenerator started in Subsection\n10.2. For example, it would be nice to understand if the space of polynomials in our\ncoordinates is a core for the generator of the Markov process, and if not then how\nthat space should be modified.\nAnother way to benefit from investigating the generator would be to obtain a\nproof of the continuity of trajectories for our processes; we are only able to show\nthat the process has c\u00e0dl\u00e0g trajectories at the moment.\n\n\fMARKOV PROCESSES . . .\n\n9\n\nAll these questions and more have been settled in the case of the z-measures\ntreated in [Ols10+]. Unfortunately, key features of that model are not present\nhere (like decomposition of the process into a one-dimensional one and a process\non a compact set, or the existence of a convenient set of functions on the state\nspace isomorphic to the well-studied algebra of symmetric functions), and one would\nclearly need new ideas.\n1.9. Organization of the paper. In Section 2 we present an abstract scheme of\nconstructing a Markov semigroup on the boundary out of a consistent family of\nsemigroups on the slices. In Section 3 we describe how the Gelfand-Tsetlin graph\nfits into this abstract scheme. Section 4 is a brief collection of general facts about\ncontinuous time Markov chains on countable spaces. Section 5 provides the construction of the Markov chains on GTN 's. In Section 6 we verify the consistency of\nthese Markov chains. Section 7 contains a brief description of the zw-measures. In\nSection 8 we develop a general formalism of building continuous time Markov chains\non paths out of a consistent family of those on the slices. In Section 9 we apply this\nformalism to our specific example and discuss the exclusion type processes. Section\n10 is an appendix without proofs; it contains a description of the finite-dimensional\ncase of integral parameters z and w, and an explicit formula for the generator of our\nMarkov process in certain coordinates.\n1.10.

For a more detailed exposition, see e.g. [Mey66, Ch. IX].\nLet E and E \u2032 be measurable spaces. A Markov kernel K : E \u2192 E \u2032 is a function\nK(x, A), where x \u2208 E and A \u2282 E \u2032 is a measurable subset, such that K(x, * ) is a\nprobability measure on E \u2032 and K( * , A) is a measurable function on E.\nLet B(E) and B(E \u2032 ) denote the Banach spaces of real-valued bounded measurable\nfunctions with the sup-norm on E and E \u2032 , respectively. A Markov kernel\nK : E \u2192 E\u2032\nR\n\u2032\ninduces a linear operator B(E ) \u2192 B(E) of norm 1 via (Kf )(x) = E \u2032 K(x, dy)f (y).\nFor two Markov kernels K1 : E \u2192 E \u2032 and K2 : E \u2032 \u2192 E \u2032\u2032 , their composition\nK1 \u25e6 K2 : E \u2192 E \u2032\u2032 is also a Markov kernel.\nDenote by M( * ) the Banach space of signed measures of bounded variation with\nthe norm given by the total variation. Let M+ ( * ) be the cone of finite positive\nmeasures, and let Mp ( * ) be the simplex of the probability measures.\n\u2032\n\u2032\nA Markov kernel K : E\nR \u2192 E also induces a linear operator M(E) \u2192 M(E ) of\nnorm 1 via (\u03bcK)(dy) = E \u03bc(dx)K(x, dy). This operator maps M+ (E) to M+ (E \u2032 )\nand Mp (E) to Mp (E \u2032 ). Note that \u03b4x K = K(x, * ), where \u03b4x is the Dirac deltameasure at x \u2208 E.\n\n\f10\n\nALEXEI BORODIN AND GRIGORI OLSHANSKI\n\nThe space M(E) (and hence M+ (E) and Mp (E)) is equipped with a \u03c3-algebra\nof measurable sets: Any preimage of a Borel set under the map \u03bc 7\u2192 \u03bc(A) from\nM(E) to R for any measurable A is measurable.\n2.2. Feller kernels. Let E and E \u2032 be locally compact topological spaces with countable bases. Let us take Borel \u03c3-algebra as the \u03c3-algebra of measurable sets for both\nof them.\nLet C( * ) \u2282 B( * ) be the Banach space of bounded continuous functions, and let\nC0 ( * ) \u2282 C( * ) be its subspace of functions that tend to 0 at infinity.\nDefinition 2.1. A Markov kernel K : E \u2192 E \u2032 is called Feller if the induced map\nB(E \u2032 ) \u2192 B(E) maps C0 (E \u2032 ) to C0 (E).\nNote that different authors may use different (nonequivalent) definitions for the\nFeller property.\nThe convenience of the space C0 ( * ) is based on the fact that this space is separable\n(as opposed to C( * ) which is not separable, except in the case when the initial\ntopological space is compact), and M( * ) is its Banach dual.\n2.3. Feller semigroups. A Markov semigroup is a family of Markov kernels P (t) :\nE \u2192 E, where t \u2265 0, P (0) = 1 (in the obvious sense), and P (s)P (t) = P (s + t).\nSuch a semigroup induces a semigroup of linear operators in B(E) as well as a\nsemigroup of linear operators in Mp (E), see above.\nWe say that a Markov semigroup (P (t))t\u22650 is Feller if\n\u2022 E is a locally compact topological space with countable base;\n\u2022 the corresponding operator semigroup in B(E) preserves C0 (E);\n\u2022 the function t 7\u2192 P (t) is strongly continuous, i.e. t 7\u2192 P (t)f is a continuous map\nfrom [0, +\u221e) to C0 (E) for any f \u2208 C0 (E) (an equivalent condition is the continuity\nat t = 0).\n2.4. Feller semigroups and Markov processes. For more details, see e.g. [EK86,\nIV.2.7].\nLet E be a locally compact separable metric space, and let (P (t))t\u22650 be a Feller\nsemigroup on E. Then for each \u03bc \u2208 Mp (E), there exists a Markov process corresponding to (P (t))t\u22650 with initial distribution \u03bc and c\u00e0dl\u00e0g sample paths. Moreover,\nthis process is strongly Markov with respect to the right-continuous version of its\nnatural filtration.\n2.5. Boundary. Let E1 , E2 , . . . be a sequence of measurable spaces linked by Markov\nkernels\n+1\n\u039bN\n: EN +1 \u2192 EN ,\nN = 1, 2, . . . .\nN\nAssume that we have another measurable space E\u221e and Markov kernels\n\u039b\u221e\nN : E\u221e \u2192 EN ,\n\nN = 1, 2, . . . ,\n\n\fMARKOV PROCESSES . . .\n\n11\n\nsuch that the natural commutativity relations hold:\nN +1\n\u039b\u221e\n= \u039b\u221e\nN +1 \u25e6 \u039bN\nN,\n\nThe kernels\n\n+1\n\u039bN\nN\n\nN = 1, 2, . . . .\n\n(2.1)\n\ninduce the chain of maps, cf. 2.1,\n\n* * * \u2192 Mp (EN +1 ) \u2192 Mp (EN ) \u2192 * * * \u2192 Mp (E2 ) \u2192 Mp (E1 ),\n\n(2.2)\n\nand we can define the projective limit lim Mp (EN ) with respect to these maps. By\n\u2190\u2212\ndefinition, it consists of sequences of measures (\u03bcN )N \u22651 , \u03bcN \u2208 Mp (EN ), that are\nlinked by the maps from (2.2). The space lim Mp (EN ) is measurable; the \u03c3-algebra\n\u2190\u2212\nof measurable sets is generated by the cylinder sets in which \u03bcN must lie inside a\nmeasurable subset of Mp (EN ), and all other coordinates (\u03bck )k6=N , are unrestricted.\nObserve that to any \u03bc\u221e \u2208 Mp (E\u221e ) one can assign an element of lim Mp (EN ) by\n\u2190\u2212\nsetting \u03bcN equal to the image of \u03bc\u221e under the map Mp (E\u221e ) \u2192 Mp (EN ) induced by\n\u039b\u221e\nN . The commutativity relations (2.1) ensure that the resulting sequence (\u03bcN )N \u22651\nis consistent with (2.2).\nDefinition 2.2. We say that E\u221e is a boundary of the sequence (EN )N \u22651 if the map\nMp (E\u221e ) \u2192 lim Mp (EN ) described in the previous paragraph is a bijection and also\n\u2190\u2212\nan isomorphism of measurable spaces.\n2.6. Feller boundary. In the setting of the previous subsection, let us further\nassume that (EN )N \u22651 and E\u221e are locally compact topological spaces with countable\n+1\nbases, and all the links (\u039bN\n)N \u22651 , (\u039b\u221e\nN )N \u22651 are Feller kernels, cf. Subsection 2.2.\nN\nThen if E\u221e satisfies Definition 2.2, we shall call it the Feller boundary for (EN )N \u22651 .\nAccording to Subsection 2.2, the links (\u039b\u221e\nN )N \u22651 induce linear operators C0 (EN ) \u2192\nC0 (E\u221e ).\nLemma 2.3. The union of images of these maps over all N \u2265 1 is dense in the\nBanach space C0 (E\u221e ).\nProof. Since M(E\u221e ) is the Banach dual to C0 (E\u221e ), it suffices to verify that if\n\u03bc \u2208 M(E\u221e ) kills all functions in our union then \u03bc = 0.\nAssume \u03bc is a signed measure on E\u221e that kills the image of C0 (EN ), N \u2265 1.\nThis is equivalent to saying that \u03bcKN\u221e = 0 for all N \u2265 1. We can represent \u03bc as\ndifference of finite positive measures\nM = \u03b1\u03bc\u2032 \u2212 \u03b2\u03bc\u2032\u2032 ,\n\u2032\n\nKN\u221e\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u03bc\u2032 , \u03bc\u2032\u2032 \u2208 Mp (E\u221e ),\n\nKN\u221e\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03b1, \u03b2 \u2265 0.\n\nKN\u221e\n\nHence, \u03b1\u03bc\n= \u03b2\u03bc\nfor all N \u2265 1. Since \u03bc\nand \u03bc\u2032\u2032 KN\u221e are in Mp (EN ),\nwe must have \u03b1 = \u03b2, and \u03bc\u2032 KN\u221e = \u03bc\u2032\u2032 KN\u221e . Definition 2.2 implies \u03bc\u2032 = \u03bc\u2032\u2032 , thus\n\u03bc = 0.\n\u0003\n2.7. Extension of semigroups to the boundary. In the setting of Subsection\n2.5, assume that for any N \u2265 1, we have a Markov semigroup (PN (t))t\u22650 on EN ,\nand these semigroups are compatible with the links:\n+1\n+1\nPN +1 (t) \u25e6 \u039bN\n= \u039bN\n\u25e6 PN (t),\nN\nN\n\nt \u2265 0,\n\nN = 1, 2, . . . .\n\n(2.3)\n\n\f12\n\nALEXEI BORODIN AND GRIGORI OLSHANSKI\n\nProposition 2.4. In the above assumptions, there exists a unique Markov semigroup\nP (t) on E\u221e such that\n\u221e\nP (t) \u25e6 \u039b\u221e\nN = \u039bN \u25e6 PN (t),\n\nt \u2265 0,\n\nN = 1, 2, . . . .\n\n(2.4)\n\nIf E\u221e is Feller (cf. Subsection 2.6) and (PN (t))t\u22650 is a Feller semigroup for any\nN \u2265 1, then (P (t))t\u22650 is also a Feller semigroup.\nProof. Denote by \u03b4x the delta-measure at a point x \u2208 E\u221e . To construct the semigroup (P (t))t\u22650 , we need to define, for any t \u2265 0, a probability measure P (t; x, * )\non E\u221e .

The space E\u221e = \u03a9 is the boundary of the chain of spaces (EN =\nGTN )N \u22651 with links as above in the sense of Definition 2.2.\nProof. This result is essentially proved in \u00a79 of [Ols03]; we provide below some\nnecessary additional comments.\nLet us abbreviate \u2206N = Mp (GTN ) and \u2206 = lim Mp (GTN ) = lim \u2206N . As in\n\u2190\u2212\n\u2190\u2212\n[Ols03] we embed \u2206 into the vector space of all real-valued functions on the set of\nvertices of the Gelfand\u2013Tsetlin graph. That space is endowed with the topology of\npointwise convergence, and \u2206 inherits this topology. The measurable structure of\n\u2206 is the Borel structure corresponding to this topology.\nObviously, \u2206 is a convex set; let Ex \u2206 \u2282 \u2206 denote the subset of extreme points.\nTheorem 9.2 in [Ols03] (which is based on Choquet's theorem) says that Ex \u2206 is a\nBorel subset of \u2206, and each point of \u2206 is uniquely representable by a probability\nBorel measure concentrated on Ex \u2206. On the other hand, it is readily seen that,\nconversely, any probability Borel measure on \u2206 (in particular, on Ex \u2206) represents\na point of \u2206, the barycenter of that measure. This gives us a bijection between\nMp (Ex \u2206) and \u2206.\nThe next step consists in identifying the abstract set Ex \u2206 with the concrete\nspace \u03a9. This is achieved with the help of Theorem 1.3 in [Ols03]. Namely, as\nis pointed out in the proof of Theorem 9.1 in [Ols03], there is a natural one-toone correspondence between the points of Ex \u2206 and the extreme characters of the\ninfinite-dimensional unitary group U(\u221e), which in turn are parameterized by the\npoints of the space \u03a9, see Theorem 1.3 in [Ols03].\nThen we have to verify that the embedding \u03a9 \u2192 \u2206 induced by the identification\n\u03a9 = Ex \u2206 is given by the kernels \u039b\u221e\nN . This is shown by the computation in [Voi76].\nWe have thus constructed a bijective map Mp (\u03a9) \u2192 \u2206, and it remains to prove\nthat it is a Borel isomorphism. As shown in the proof of Theorem 8.1 of [Ols03],\nthe map \u03c9 7\u2192 \u039b\u221e\nN (\u03c9, \u03bb) is continuous for every N = 1, 2, . . . and every \u03bb \u2208 GTN .\nThis implies that the map Mp (\u03a9) \u2192 \u2206 is Borel. To show that the inverse map\nis also Borel one can apply an abstract result (Theorem 3.2 in [Mack57]), which\nasserts that a Borel one-to-one map of a standard Borel space onto a subset of a\ncountably generated Borel space is a Borel isomorphism. This result is applicable in\nour situation, since the Borel structure of \u03a9 is standard, so that the induced Borel\nstructure on Mp (\u03a9) is standard, too.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.2.

Now we get rid of the restriction \u03b21\u00b1 \u2264 21 . Set\nB \u00b1 (k) = #{i \u2265 1 | \u03b2i\u00b1 (k) > 21 }.\nSince for any k \u2265 1 we have \u03b21+ (k) + \u03b21\u2212 (k) \u2264 1, at least one of the numbers B \u00b1 (k)\nis equal to 0.

Hence, possibly passing to\na subsequence and switching + and \u2212, we may assume that B + (k) \u2192 \u221e as k \u2192 \u221e.\nUsing the identity (cf.

Since no \u03b2-coordinates of \u03c9\u0303(k) are greater than 1/2, the argument of Step\n2 implies that if \u03b4\u0303 + (k) + \u03b4\u0303 \u2212 (k) \u2192 \u221e then \u03c6n0 (\u03c9(k)) = \u03c6n0 \u2212B+ (k) (\u03c9\u0303(k)) \u2192 0 as\nk \u2192 \u221e, which contradicts our assumption. Hence, \u03b4\u0303 + (k) + \u03b4\u0303 \u2212 (k) is bounded.\nLet us deform the integration contour in (3.4) to |u| = R with A/(1+A) < R < 1.\nUsing the estimates (for |u| = R, 0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 A, 0 \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264 1/2)\n|1 + \u03b2(u\u00b11 \u2212 1)| \u2264 1 + \u03b2|u\u00b11 \u2212 1| \u2264 econst1 \u03b2 ,\n|1 \u2212 \u03b1(u\u00b11 \u2212 1)|\u22121 \u2264 |1 \u2212 \u03b1(R\u00b11 \u2212 1)|\u22121 \u2264 econst2 \u03b1 ,\n|e\u03b3(u\n\n\u00b11 \u22121)\n\n| \u2264 econst3 \u03b3\n+\n\n\u2212\n\nwith suitable constj > 0, j = 1, 2, 3, we see that |\u03a6\u03c9\u0303(k) (u)| \u2264 econst4 (\u03b4\u0303 (k)+\u03b4\u0303 (k)) , for\n+\na const4 > 0, which remains bounded.

Generalities on Markov chains on countable spaces\n4.1. Regularity. Let E be a countable set, and let (P (t))t\u22650 be a Markov semigroup\non E. Each P (t) may be viewed as a matrix with rows and columns marked by\nelements of E; its entries will be denoted by P (t; a, b), a, b \u2208 E. By definition,\nP (t; a, b) is the probability that the process will be in the state b at the time moment\nt conditioned that it is in the state a at time 0. Thus, all matrix elements of\nP (t) are nonnegative, and their sum is equal to 1 along any row - the matrix P (t)\n\n\fMARKOV PROCESSES . . .\n\n19\n\nis stochastic.

Its elements are continuous in t \u2208 [0, +\u221e) and\ndifferentiable in t \u2208 (0, +\u221e), and it provides a solution of Kolmogorov's backward\nand forward equations (4.2), (4.4) with the initial condition (4.3).\n(ii) P (t) also satisfies the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation.\n(iii) P (t) is the minimal solution of (4.2) (or (4.4)) in the sense that for any\nother solution P (t) of (4.2) (or (4.4)) with the initial condition (4.3) in the class of\nsubstochastic matrices, one has P (t; a, b) \u2265 P (t; a, b) for any a, b \u2208 E.\nCorollary 4.2. If the minimal solution P (t) is stochastic (the sums of matrix elements along the rows are all equal to 1 ) then it is the unique solution of (4.2) (or\n(4.4)) with the initial condition (4.3) in the class of substochastic matrices.\nIf the minimal solution P (t) is stochastic one says that the matrix of transition\nrates Q is regular , cf.

(5.7)\n\nl=0\n\n\u0003\n\nLet us now apply Feller's results to our situation.\nProof of Theorem 5.1. By Proposition 4.3, in order to show that the minimal solution is stochastic it suffices to prove that the probability that the first passage time\nfrom 0 to n is below a fixed number, converges to zero as n \u2192 +\u221e. Indeed, as\nshifts x \u2192 x + const and sign change x 7\u2192 \u2212x keep our class of processes intact,\nsimilar convergence would automatically hold for passage times to the left, and also\nfor passage times from any initial position. Denote the first passage time from 0 to\nn by Tn .\nA simple coupling argument shows that Tn stochastically dominates the first passage time from 0 to n for the birth and death process on Z\u22650 with the same transition\nrates (see (5.1)), except that the jump from 0 to \u22121 is forbidden. Let us denote this\nnew first passage time by Ten . Thus,\nProb{Tn \u2264 t} \u2264 Prob{Ten \u2264 t} for any n \u2265 0 and t > 0.\n\nFor the application of Theorem 5.1 we then set\n\u03b2x = (x \u2212 u)(x \u2212 u\u2032 ),\n\n\u03b4x = (x + v)(x + v \u2032 ),\n\nx \u2265 0,\n\nx \u2265 1,\n\n\u03b40 = 0.\n\nAs\n\u03b41 * * * \u03b4l\n\u0393(v + l + 1)\u0393(v \u2032 + l + 1)\n\u2032\n\u2032\n= const\n\u223c const * lu+u +v+v ,\n\u2032\n\u03b20 * * * \u03b2l\n\u0393(\u2212u + l + 1)\u0393(\u2212u + l + 1)\nour original assumption u + u\u2032 + v + v \u2032 > \u22121 implies\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nxk \u223c const * k u+u +v+v +1 ,\n\nk \u2192 \u221e,\n\nl \u2192 \u221e,\n\n(5.8)\n\ncf. (5.2), and x\u221e = limk\u2192\u221e xk = \u221e. Therefore, Corollary 5.3 yields\nlim u(xn ) = \u221e.\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nOn the other hand, from (5.5) with i = 0 and any a > 0 we obtain\nZ \u221e\nZ t\nZ t\n1\n\u2212a\u03c4\n\u2212a\u03c4\n\u2212at\n=\ne dF0 (\u03c4 ) \u2265\ne dF0 (\u03c4 ) \u2265 e\ndF0 (\u03c4 ) = e\u2212at Prob{Ten \u2264 t}\nu(xn )\n0\n0\n0\nwhence\neat\n\u2192 0,\nn \u2192 +\u221e.\nProb{Ten \u2264 t} \u2264\nu(xn )\n\n\fMARKOV PROCESSES . . .\n\n27\n\nSince Ten is dominated by Tn , we have shown that our Markov chain does not run\naway to infinity in finite time, and hence it is uniquely specified by the transition\nrates. Let (P1 (t))t\u22650 be the corresponding semigroup.\nWe now need to prove that (P1 (t))t\u22650 is Feller. This is equivalent to showing that\nlimn\u2192\u00b1\u221e P1 (t; n, i) = 0 for any i \u2208 Z and t > 0.\nShift and sign change invariance (see the beginning of the proof) imply that it\nsuffices to consider i = 0 and n \u2192 +\u221e. Observe that P1 (t; n, 0) cannot be greater\nthan the probability that the first passage time from n to 0 is not more than t. Let\nus denote this first passage time by Sn ; we have P1 (t; n, 0) \u2264 Prob{Sn \u2264 t}.\nThis first passage time is the same for our birth and death process on Z and for\nits modification on Z\u22650 that was used in the first part of the proof. On the other\nhand, for the process on Z\u22650 the Laplace transform of Sn is given by (5.6).\nBy (5.4) we have, as k \u2192 \u221e,\n\u03bck =\n\n\u03b20 * * * \u03b2k\u22121\n\u0393(\u2212u + k)\u0393(\u2212u\u2032 + k)\n\u2032\n\u2032\n= const\n\u223c const * k \u22122\u2212u\u2212u \u2212v\u2212v .\n\u2032\n\u03b41 * * * \u03b4k\n\u0393(v + k + 1)\u0393(v + k + 1)\n\nHence, cf.

Theorem 5.2(ii) then gives\nlim v(xn ) = 0\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nand using (5.6) and estimating the Laplace transform as above we obtain\nProb{Sn \u2264 t} \u2264\n\neat v(xn )\n\u2192 0,\nv(x0 )\n\nn \u2192 \u221e.\n\nAs P1 (t; n, 0) \u2264 Prob{Sn \u2264 t}, the proof of Theorem 5.1 is complete.\n\n\u0003\n\n5.2.

It is convenient\nto encode signatures of length N by N-tuples of strictly decreasing integers via\n\u03bb = (\u03bb1 \u2265 \u03bb2 \u2265 * * * \u2265 \u03bbN ) \u2190\u2192 (l1 > l2 > * * * > lN ),\n\nlj = \u03bbj +N\u2212j,\n\n1 \u2264 j \u2264 N.\n\nThis establishes a bijection between GTN and the set\nXN = {(x1 , . . . , xN ) \u2208 ZN | x1 > x2 > * * * > xN }.\nIn XN , matrix D (N ) from (5.9) takes the form\nD (N ) (X, Y ) =\n\nVN (Y )\nD(x1 , y1 )1{xi =yi ,i6=1} + D(x2 , y2 )1{xi =yi ,i6=2} + . . .\nVN (X)\n\u0001\n+ D(xN , yN )1{xi =yi ,i6=N } \u2212 dN 1X=Y\n\n(5.13)\n\nwith X = (x1 , . . . , xN ) \u2208 XN , Y = (y1 , . . . , yN ) \u2208 XN , and\nY\nVN (z1 , . . . , zN ) =\n(zi \u2212 zj ).\n1\u2264i<j\u2264N\n\nIn this notation, (5.11) is equivalent to\n\n(D1 + * * * + DN )VN (X) = dN VN (X),\n\nX \u2208 ZN ,\n\n(5.14)\n\n\fMARKOV PROCESSES . . .\n\n29\n\nwhere Dj denotes a linear operator on ZN with\nDj (X, Y ) = D(xj , yj )1{xi =yi ,i6=j} .\nIndeed, both sides of (5.14) are skew-symmetric, and restricting to XN yields (5.11).\nLet \u2206 and \u2207 be the standard forward and backward difference operators on Z:\n\u2206f (x) = f (x + 1) \u2212 f (x),\n\n\u2207f (x) = f (x) \u2212 f (x \u2212 1)\n\nfor any function f : Z \u2192 C.

This implies that the lefthand side of (5.14) is a skew-symmetric polynomial of degree at most N(N \u2212 1)/2.\nIt must be divisible by the Vandermonde determinant VN (X), and it remains to\nverify the constant prefactor.

Note that we are using the fact that the birth and death\nprocess does not make infinitely many jumps in finite time (minimal solution is\nstochastic), cf.

For that reason, introduce two new pairs of parameters (z, z \u2032 )\nand (w, w \u2032) that satisfy the same conditions as (u, u\u2032, v, v \u2032) before:\n(z + k)(z \u2032 + k) > 0,\n\n(w + k)(w \u2032 + k) > 0 \u2200k \u2208 Z;\n\nz + z \u2032 + w + w \u2032 > \u22121.\n(6.1)\n\nFurthermore, for N \u2265 1 define\nuN = z + N \u2212 1,\n\nu\u2032N = z \u2032 + N \u2212 1,\n\nv = w,\n\nv \u2032 = w\u2032,\n\n(6.2)\n\n\f32\n\nALEXEI BORODIN AND GRIGORI OLSHANSKI\n\nand let (PN (t))t\u22650 be the Feller semigroup of the previous section with parameters\n\u2032\n(u, u\u2032, v, v \u2032) = (uN , u\u2032N , vN , vN\n).\nWe are aiming to prove the following statement.\n+1\nTheorem 6.1.

Assume A(\u03bb\u0302, \u03bd\u0302) 6= 0 for some \u03bb\u0302 and \u03bd\u0302. Let \u03bd (1) , . . . , \u03bd (l) \u2208 GTN be all\nsignatures different from \u03bd\u0302 and such that A(\u03bb\u0302, \u03bd (j) ) 6= 0.\nSet x = (\u03bd\u03021 + N \u2212 1, . . . , \u03bd\u0302N ) \u2208 ZN and\n(j)\n(j) \u0001\nj = 1, . . . , l.\ny (j) = \u03bd1 + N \u2212 1, . . . , \u03bdN \u2208 ZN ,\n\nObserve that the orbits of the vectors x, y (1) , . . . , y (l) under the group of permutations of the coordinates do not intersect. It follows that there exists a polynomial\nf in N variables, which takes value 1 on the orbit of x and vanishes on the orbits\nof the vectors y (1) , . . . , y (l). Then for the symmetrized polynomial F (z1 , . . . , zN ) =\nP\n\u03c3\u2208SN f (z\u03c3(1) , . . . , z\u03c3(N ) ) the left-hand side of (6.4) is equal to N!A(\u03bb\u0302, \u03bd\u0302) 6= 0.

Moreover, for any fixed c \u2208 C, the polynomials {F\u03bc,c } with \u03bc ranging over\nall nonnegative signatures in GTN form a linear basis in the space of all symmetric\npolynomials in N variables. Indeed, this follows from the fact that the highest degree\nhomogeneous component of F\u03bc,c coincides with the Schur polynomial s\u03bc (x1 , . . . , xN ),\nand those are well known to form a basis, see e.g. [Macd95].\nHence, to prove Proposition 6.2 it suffices to verify that the two sides of (6.3) give\nthe same results when applied to F\u03bc,c for a fixed c and \u03bc varying over nonnegative\nsignatures of length N.\nLemma 6.4.

Assume that the matrices of transition rates Q, Q\u2217 , and Qx for\nany x \u2208 E are regular.

Gathering all the\ndefinitions together, we obtain that the off-diagonal entries of D(N ) have the form\n(\n(lik \u2212 z \u2212 k + 1)(lik \u2212 z \u2032 \u2212 k + 1),\nD(N ) (\u03bb, \u03bd) =\n(lik + w)(lik + w \u2032 ),\nwhere for the first line we must have i, k and l, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k \u2264 l \u2264 N, such that\nj\nli+k\u2212j\n= lik + k \u2212 j,\n\nj\nnji+k\u2212j = li+k\u2212j\n+ 1 for all k \u2264 j \u2264 l,\n\nand all other coordinates of \u03bb and \u03bd are equal, while for the second line we must\nhave i, k, l with 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k \u2264 l \u2264 N such that\nlij = lik ,\n\nnji = lij \u2212 1 for all k \u2264 j \u2264 l,\n\nand all other coordinates of \u03bb and \u03bd are equal.\nThe Markov chain generated by D(N ) can be described as follows:\n(1) Each coordinate lik tries to jump to the right by 1 with rate (lik \u2212 z \u2212 k + 1)(lik \u2212\nz \u2032 \u2212 k + 1) and to the left by 1 with rate (lik + w)(lik + w \u2032 ), independently of other\ncoordinates.\nk\u22121\n(2) If the lik -clock of the right jump rings but lik = li\u22121\n, the jump is blocked. If its\nk\u22121\nk\nleft clock rings but li = li + 1, the jump is also blocked. (If any of the two jumps\nwere allowed then the resulting set of coordinates would not have corresponded to\nan element of GT(N ) as the interlacing conditions would have been violated.)\n\n(3) If the right lik -clock rings and there is no blocking, we find the greatest number\nl \u2265 k such that lij = lik + k \u2212 j for j = k, k + 1, . . . , l, and move all the coordinates\n{lij }lj=k to the right by one. Given the change lik 7\u2192 lik + 1, this is the minimal\nmodification of the set of coordinates that preserves interlacing.\n(4) If the left lik -clock rings and there is no blocking, we find the greatest number\nj\nl \u2265 k such that li+j\u2212k\n= lik for j = k, k + 1, . . . , l, and move all the coordinates\nj\n{li+j\u2212k\n}lj=k to the left by one. Again, given the change lik 7\u2192 lik \u2212 1, this is the\nminimal modification of the set of coordinates that preserves interlacing.\nCertain Markov chain on interlacing arrays with a similar block-push mechanism\nhave been studied in [BF08+], see also [BK10]. In those examples the jump rates\nare constant though.\n1One\n\ncould make the interlacing condition more symmetric (both inequalities being strict) by\nconsidering the coordinates e\nlij = \u03bbji + (j + 1)/2 \u2212 i instead. This would imply however that\ne\nlij \u2208 Z + 1/2 for odd j while e\nlij \u2208 Z for even j.\n\n\fMARKOV PROCESSES . . .\n\n55\n\n9.3. Regularity. In order to claim the benefits of Proposition 8.6 and Corollary\n8.7, we need to verify the regularity of the fiber matrices of transition rates (8.28).\nIn our concrete realization, they take the following form.\nFor any N \u2265 2 and any \u03ba \u2208 EN \u22121 = GTN \u22121 , the fiber E\u03ba =: GT\u03ba \u2282 GTN takes\nthe form\nGT\u03ba = {\u03bb \u2208 GTN | \u03ba \u227a \u03bb}.\nN\nUsing the coordinates {li = N + \u03bbi \u2212 i}N\ni=1 for \u03bb \u2208 GTN and {ni = N + \u03bdi \u2212 i}i=1\nfor \u03bd \u2208 GTN , the off-diagonal part of the matrix of transition rates D\u03ba := Q\u03ba on\nthe fiber GT\u03ba has the form\n(\n(li \u2212 z \u2212 N + 1)(li \u2212 z \u2032 \u2212 N + 1),\nD\u03ba (\u03bb, \u03bd) =\n(li + w)(li + w \u2032 ),\nwhere for the first line we must have i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N, such that\nni = li + 1,\n\nnj = lj\n\nfor j 6= i,\n\nnj = lj\n\nfor j 6= i.\n\nand for the second line we must have\nni = li \u2212 1,\n\nProposition 9.2. For any N \u2265 2 and any \u03ba \u2208 GTN \u22121 , the matrix of transition\nrates D\u03ba on GT\u03ba is regular.\nProof. The interlacing condition in the definition of GT\u03ba implies that D\u03ba is the\nmatrix of transition rates for N independent birth and death processes conditioned\nto stay within N non-overlapping intervals inside Z; one interval per process. The\nresults of Section 3.2 show that any such birth and death process is regular as such\na process either lives on a finite set or it is a one-sided birth and death process of\nthe type considered in the proof of Theorem 5.1.\n\u0003\nCorollary 9.3. For any N \u2265 1, the matrix D(N ) of transition rates on GT(N )\nis regular, and the corresponding semigroup (P (N ) (t))t\u22650 is central. The induced\nMarkov semigroup on GTN coincides with that of Section 5.\nProof. Follows from Proposition 8.6 and Corollary 8.7.\n\n\u0003\n\n9.4. Exclusion process. Observe that the projection of the Markov chain generated by D(N ) to the coordinate l11 is a bilateral birth and death process. Furthermore, the jumps of l12 are only influenced by l11 , the jumps of l13 are only influenced\nby l11 and l12 , and so on. On the other side, the jumps of lkk are only influenced by\nk\u22121\n{l11 , l22 , . . . lk\u22121\n} for any k \u2265 2.\nHence, the projection of the Markov chain defined by D(N ) to the coordinates\nN \u22121\n2\nN\n1\n2\nN\n(lN \u2264 lN\n\u22121 \u2264 * * * \u2264 l1 < l1 < * * * < l1 ) is also a Markov chain . The fibers of\n2Once again, all the\n\ninequalities would be strict if we considered coordinates e\nlij = \u03bbji +(j+1)/2\u2212i.\n\n\f56\n\nALEXEI BORODIN AND GRIGORI OLSHANSKI\n\nthis projection are finite, hence, according to Proposition 4.4, our Markov chain on\nGT(N ) collapses to the smaller one, whose matrix of transition rates is also regular.\nLet us project even further to (l11 < l12 < * * * < l1N ). Killing extra coordinates one\nby one and using the results of Section 5.1 to verify the regularity for the fiber chains,\nwe see that the collapsibility of Proposition 4.4 holds. Let us give an independent\ndescription of the resulting Markov chain on {l1j }j\u22651.\nSet\nYN = {y1 < y2 < * * * < yN | yj \u2208 Z, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 N},\nY\u221e = {y1 < y2 < * * * | yj \u2208 Z, j \u2265 1}.\n(N )\n\nDefine the matrix Dtop of transition rates on YN by\n(\n(yk \u2212 z \u2212 k + 1)(yk \u2212 z \u2032 \u2212 k + 1),\nD(N ) (Y \u2032 , Y \u2032\u2032 ) =\n(yk + w)(yk + w \u2032 ),\nwhere for the first line we must have k and l, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 l \u2264 N, such that\nyj\u2032 = yk\u2032 + k \u2212 j,\n\nyj\u2032\u2032 = yj\u2032 + 1 for all k \u2264 j \u2264 l,\n\nand all other coordinates of Y \u2032 and Y \u2032\u2032 are equal, while for the second line we must\nhave\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\nyk\u2032\u2032 = yk\u2032 \u2212 1,\nym\n= ym\n, for m 6= k.\nIn other words, each coordinate yk tries to jump to the right by 1 with rate\n(yk \u2212 z \u2212 j + 1)(yk \u2212 z \u2032 \u2212 j + 1), and it tries to jump to the left by 1 with rate\n(yk + w)(yk + w \u2032), independently of other coordinates. If the left yk clock rings but\nyk = yk\u22121 + 1 then the jump is blocked. If the right yk -clock rings we find the\ngreatest number l \u2265 k such that yj = yk + k \u2212 j for j = k, k + 1, . . . , l, and move all\nthe coordinates {yk , . . . , yl } to the right by one. One could think of yk \"pushing\"\nyk+1, . . . , yl . Alternatively, if one forgets about the labeling one could think of yk\njumping to the first available site on its right.\nClearly, these Markov chains are compatible with projections YN +1 \u2192 YN that\nremove the last coordinate. Thus, we obtain a Markov semigroup on lim YN = Y\u221e .\n\u2190\u2212\nThis semigroup is a sort of an exclusion process - it is a one-dimensional interacting particle system with each site occupied by no more than one particle (exclusion\nconstraint). A similar system, but with constant jump rates, was considered in\n[BF08] and called PushASEP. A system with one-sided jumps and blocking mechanism as above is usually referred to as Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process\n(TASEP), while a system with one-sided jumps and pushing mechanism as above\nis sometimes called long range TASEP. See [Spi70], [Lig99] for more information on\nexclusion processes.\nProposition 9.4. The exclusion process defined above has a unique invariant probability measure. With probability 1 with respect to this measure there exists a limit\n\n\fMARKOV PROCESSES . . .\n\n57\n\nr = limN \u2192\u221e yN /N, which is a random variable with values \u2265 1.

The quantity limN \u2192\u221e yN /N can be viewed as the asymptotic density\nof the system of particles (yj ) at infinity. Proposition 9.4 claims that for the invariant\nmeasure, this quantity is well-defined and random.\n2. The restrictions on parameters come from Theorem 7.1 of [BD02]. They can\nbe relaxed, see Remark 7.2 in [BD02] and the end of \u00a73 in [Lis09+].\n3. The differential equation above is the so-called \u03c3-form of the Painlev\u00e9 VI\nequation first appeared in [JM81].\n\u03c3(s) = \u2212a21 s + 21 (a3 a4 + a21 ) +\n\nProof of Proposition 9.4.

The existence of limN \u2192\u221e yN /N follows from Theorem 9.1. Finally, the characterization of the distribution of this limit in terms of the Painlev\u00e9 VI equation was\nproved in Theorem 7.1 of [BD02], see [Lis09+] for another proof.\n\u0003\n10. Appendix\n10.1. Truncated Gelfand-Tsetlin graph. Fix two numbers k, l = 0, 1, 2, . . . not\nequal to 0 simultaneously. Denote by GTN (k, l) the subset of GTN formed by the\nsignatures \u03bb subjected to the restrictions\nk \u2265 \u03bb1 \u2265 * * * \u2265 \u03bbN \u2265 \u2212l.\nObviously, this subset is finite and nonempty, and if \u03bb \u2208 GTN (k, l) and \u03bd \u227a \u03bb then\n\u03bd \u2208 GTN \u22121 (k, l). Thus, the union of the sets GTN (k, l) for N = 1, 2, . . . forms\n\n\f58\n\nALEXEI BORODIN AND GRIGORI OLSHANSKI\n\na subgraph of the Gelfand-Tsetlin graph. Let us denote this truncated graph as\n+1\nGT(k, l). The definition of the links \u039bN\n(\u03bb, \u03bd) in the truncated graph remains the\nN\nsame, the only difference is that we assume \u03bb and \u03bd to be vertices of GT(k, l).\nThe boundary of GT(k, l) is the subset \u03a9(k, l) \u2282 \u03a9 determined by the restrictions\n\u03b1\u00b1 \u2261 0,\n\n\u03b3 \u00b1 = 0,\n\n\u03b2i+ = 0 (i > k),\n\n\u03b2j\u2212 = 0 (j > l),\n\nso that only k + l parameters are nontrivial:\n\u03b21+ \u2265 * * * \u2265 \u03b2k+ \u2265 0,\n\n\u03b21\u2212 \u2265 * * * \u2265 \u03b2l\u2212 \u2265 0,\n\nwhere, as before, \u03b21+ + \u03b21\u2212 \u2264 1. The definition of the links \u039b\u221e\nN (\u03c9, \u03bb) remains the\nsame, only \u03c9 is assumed to belong to \u03a9(k, l). Viewing \u03a9(k, l) as a subset of Rk+l\none sees that it is a closed simplex of full dimension.\nThe boundary is Feller. Since \u03a9(k, l) is compact, this simply means that the links\n\u039b\u221e (\u03c9, \u03bb) are continuous in \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9(k, l).\nFix parameters\nz = k,\n\nz \u2032 = k + a,\n\nw = l,\n\nw \u2032 = l + b,\n\nwhere a, b > \u22121.\n\n(10.1)\n\nSetting\nu = z,\n\nu\u2032 = z \u2032 ,\n\nv = w,\n\nv\u2032 = w\u2032\n\nin (5.1) we obtain a truncated birth and death process on {\u2212l, . . . , k} \u2282 Z; the rates\nof jumps k \u2192 k + 1 and \u2212l \u2192 \u2212l \u2212 1 being equal to 0. Note that the nonnegativity\nof the jump rates on {\u2212l, . . . , k} \u2282 Z is ensured by the inequalities a, b > \u22121.\nMore generally, for any N \u2265 1 the same expressions as before correctly determine\na matrix of transition rates on GTN (k, l). Due to finiteness of the state space, the\nexistence of the corresponding Markov semigroup (PN (t))t\u22650 becomes obvious.\nThe semigroups (PN (t))t\u22650 with varying N = 1, 2, . . . are consistent with the links\nand thus determine a Feller Markov semigroup (P (t))t\u22650 on the boundary \u03a9(k, l).\nThe expression for Mz,z \u2032,w,w\u2032|N (\u03bb) given in \u00a75.1 vanishes unless \u03bb belongs to the\nsubset GTN (k, l), and it is strictly positive on this subset. Thus, the same definition gives us a probability measure on GTN (k, l). The invariance property and\n+1\nthe compatibility with the links \u039bN\nremain valid. The limit measure lives on the\nN\nboundary \u03a9(k, l) and it is invariant with respect to the semigroup (P (t))t\u22650 .\nThe whole picture sketched above is consistent with the automorphism of GT\ndescribed in Remark 3.2. More precisely, the shift of all coordinates of signatures by\n1 amounts to the transformation k \u2192 k + 1, l \u2192 l \u2212 1 of the main parameters (the\nother two parameters a and b do not change). The use of this shift automorphism\nallows one to reduce the case of general parameters (k, l) to the special case (n, 0)\nwith n = k + l, which simplifies some formulas and computations.\nHence, let us now assume that l = 0. Then the coordinates \u03b2j\u2212 disappear and we\nare left with n coordinates yi := \u03b2i+ subjected to\n1 \u2265 y1 \u2265 * * * \u2265 yn \u2265 0.\n\n\fMARKOV PROCESSES . . .\n\n59\n\nThe signatures \u03bb \u2208 GTN (n, 0) may be identified with Young diagrams contained\nin the rectangular shape N \u00d7n; that is, \u03bb has at most N rows and n columns.

There are some indications that\na direct generalization is impossible, in the sense that the generator cannot be expressed as a second order differential operator in the natural coordinates (\u03b1\u00b1 , \u03b2 \u00b1 , \u03b4 \u00b1 )\non \u03a9. 3 Instead of this, we present below an explicit expression for the generator in\na different system of coordinates.\nIntroduce the functions \u03c6n = \u03c6n (\u03c9) on \u03a9, n \u2208 Z, as the coefficients in the Laurent\nexpansion of \u03a6\u03c9 (u), see (3.3) and (3.4),\nX\n\u03a6\u03c9 (u) =\n\u03c6n (\u03c9)un .\nn\u2208Z\n\nThe functions \u03c6n are continuous and nonnegative on \u03a9, and they satisfy the relation\nX\n\u03c6n (\u03c9) \u2261 1,\n\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9,\nn\u2208Z\n\nwhich is an immediate consequence of the fact that \u03a6\u03c9 (u) takes value 1 at u = 1 for\nall \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9.\nLet us extend this definition by setting, for any N = 1, 2, . . . and any signature\n\u03bd \u2208 GTN ,\n\u0002\n\u0003N\n\u03c6\u03bd (\u03c9) = det \u03c6\u03bdi\u2212i+j (\u03c9) i,j=1,\n\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9.\n3A\n\npossible explanation is that these coordinate functions are not in the domain of the generator.\n\n\fMARKOV PROCESSES . . .\n\n61\n\nFor instance, for N = 2 we have \u03bd = (\u03bd1 , \u03bd2 ) and\n\u03c6(\u03bd1 ,\u03bd2 ) =\n\n\u03c6\u03bd1 \u03c6\u03bd1 +1\n= \u03c6\u03bd1 \u03c6\u03bd2 \u2212 \u03c6\u03bd1 +1 \u03c6\u03bd2 \u22121 .\n\u03c6\u03bd2 \u22121 \u03c6\u03bd2\n\nThe functions \u03c6\u03bd appear in the expansion\nN\nY\ni=1\n\nX\n\n\u03a6\u03c9 (ui ) =\n\n\u03c6\u03bd (\u03c9)s\u03bd (u1 , . . . , uN ).\n\n\u03bd\u2208GTN\n\nTheir fundamental role is explained by (3.2).\nBy definition, the functions \u03c6\u03bd are contained in the algebra of functions generated\nby the functions \u03c6n , n \u2208 Z. Conversely, any monomial in \u03c6n 's of degree N can be\nexpanded into a series on the functions \u03c6\u03bd , \u03bd \u2208 GTN . Namely, for arbitrary integers\nn1 , . . . , nN , one has\nX\nK(\u03bd | n1 , . . . , nN )\u03c6\u03bd ,\n\u03c6n 1 . . . \u03c6n N =\n\u03bd\u2208GTN\n\nwhere the numbers K(. . . ) are defined as the \"rational\" analogs of the Kostka numbers, that is, these are the coefficients in the Laurent expansion of the rational Schur\nfunctions,\nX\ns\u03bd (u1 , . . . , uN ) =\nK(\u03bd | n1 , . . . , nN )un1 1 . . . unNN .\nn1 ,...,nN \u2208Z\n\nFor instance, for N = 2 and \u03bd = (\u03bd1 , \u03bd2 ) we have\n(\n1, if n1 + n2 = \u03bd1 + \u03bd2 and |n1 \u2212 n2 | \u2264 \u03bd1 \u2212 \u03bd2 ,\nK(\u03bd1 , \u03bd2 | n1 , n2 ) =\n0, otherwise,\nwhich implies\n\u03c6n 1 \u03c6n 2 =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03c6(n1 +p,n2 \u2212p) .\n\np=0\n\nDefinition 10.2.

As\nabove, let PN (t) (N = 1, 2, . . . ) and P (t) be the corresponding Markov semigroups\nand let AN and A stand for their infinitesimal generators. These are densely defined\noperators in the Banach spaces C0 (GTN ) and C0 (\u03a9), respectively. We know that\nall finitely supported functions on GTN belong to the domain of AN . This implies,\ncf. (3.2), that all the functions \u03c6\u03bd lie in the domain of A.\nTheorem 10.3. Let A be the infinitesimal generator of the Markov semigroup\n(P (t))t\u22650 with parameters (z, z \u2032 , w, w \u2032) satisfying condition (6.1), and D be the formal differential operator introduced in Definition 10.2. Regard D as an operator\nfrom the space C[\u03c6n : n \u2208 Z] of polynomials in countably many variables \u03c6n , n \u2208 Z,\nto the larger space C[[\u03c6n : n \u2208 Z]] of formal series in the same variables.\nThen for any N = 1, 2, . . . and any \u03bd \u2208 GTN one has\nD\u03c6\u03bd = A\u03c6\u03bd .\nMoreover, D is the only formal second order differential operator in variables \u03c6n ,\nn \u2208 Z, with such a property.\nNote some properties of D:\nP\n1. Formal application of D to the infinite series n\u2208Z \u03c6n gives 0. This agrees with\nthe fact that the sum of this series on \u03a9 equals 1 and the fact that A1 = 0.\n2. For any fixed integer m, D is invariant under the change of variables \u03c6n \u2192 \u03c6n+m\n(n \u2208 Z) combined with the shift of parameters\nz \u2192 z + m,\n\nz \u2032 \u2192 z \u2032 + m,\n\nw \u2192 w \u2212 m,\n\nw \u2032 \u2192 w \u2212 m,\n\ncf. Remark 3.7 in [BO05a].\n3. Set z = k and w = l, where (k, l) is a couple of nonnegative integers not equal\nto (0, 0). Then D respects the relations\n* * * = \u03c6\u2212l\u22122 = \u03c6\u2212l\u22121 = 0 = \u03c6k+1 = \u03c6k+2 = . . .\n\n\fMARKOV PROCESSES . . .\n\n63\n\nand thus can be reduced to an operator in the polynomial algebra C[\u03c6\u2212l , . . . , \u03c6k ].\nMore precisely, this means the following assertion: When D is applied to a monomial\ncontaining at least one variable \u03c6n with index n outside [\u2212l, k] then all monomials entering the resulting series with nonzero coefficients have the same property.\nIndeed, this follows from the structure of the coefficients An1 n2 and Bn .\nMoreover, the resulting operator in the algebra C[\u03c6\u2212l , . . . , \u03c6k ] can be further reduced modulo the relation\nX\n\u03c6n = 1,\n\u2212l\u2264n\u2264k\n\n(a,b)\n\nand then it coincides with the differential operator Dk+l from Theorem 10.1, where\na = z \u2032 \u2212 k, b = w \u2032 \u2212 l. Here we use the fact that quotient algebra\nC[\u03c6\u2212l , . . . , \u03c6k ]/(\u03c6\u2212l + * * * + \u03c6k = 1)\ncan be identified with the algebra of polynomial functions on the simplex \u03a9(k, l).\nReferences\n[And91]\n\nW.
