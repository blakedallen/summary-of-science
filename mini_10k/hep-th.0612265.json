However, in the course of searching for new theories the models described\nby higher-oder derivative Lagrangians are considered too [1, 2]. It is worth mentioning\nhere the gauge theories with higher derivatives [3, 4], the gravitation models with higher\noder curvature corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], the\nmodels of point particles with Lagrangians depending on curvature and torsion of the world\ntrajectories [13, 14], rigid strings [15]. The higher derivative theories have some appealing\nproperties, in particular, the convergence of the Feynman diagrams is improved [16].\nAn important peculiarity of higher derivative theories is the energy unboundness from\nbelow already at the classical level. Here the energy is defined as the conserved Noether\nquantity corresponding to the invariance of the theory under time translation or, that is\nthe same, as the value of the Ostrogradski Hamiltonian on the solutions to the equations\nof motion [17, 18]. It is agreed-upon that the bottomless energy spectrum in theories with\nhigher derivatives results in their instability. However the development of this instability\nwas not traced in detail in literature yet.\nIf the theory with higher derivatives is conservative, then the negative value of its energy, which is preserved in time, does not formally lead to any contradictions because it is\nunobservable simply. In experiment we can detect only the energy changes. However when\nsuch a system experiences an external action by dissipative forces, the following situation\nis feasible. The system will accomplish a positive work against the external friction forces\nand, at the same time, the amplitude of internal motion, which gives a negative contribution to the energy, will not damp, as usual, but it will increase. Remarkably, the energy\nconservation law will formally hold during this process. Such a behaviour of a material\nsystem is obviously absurd from the physical standpoint, and the pertinent theory should\nbe discarded without any references on the instability. Nevertheless it is instructive to trace\nthe development of this instability.\nSince the energy in theories with higher derivatives is not restricted from below, there\nare no reasons to stop the increase of the amplitude of internal motion mentioned above.\nHence a weak external action can lead to a drastical change of the internal dynamics of\nthe system under consideration. It is this behaviour of the dynamical system described by\n2\n\n\fhigher-order Lagrangian function that should be kept in mind when saying about instability\nof such systems.\nIt is worth noting that at the quantum level this feature of the theories with higher\nderivatives is manifested usually through the appearance of the states with negative norm [1,\n12, 17, 19] and, as a consequence, in violation of the unitarity. However the physical origin\nof this drawback is the bottomless energy spectrum in theories at hand.\nThis paper seeks to trace in detail the development of this instability considering the\nPais-Uhlenbeck fourth oder oscillator [1] which is the simplest theory of this kind.\nThe layout of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian descriptions of the Pais-Uhlenbeck fourth order oscillator are presented. In Sec. III the classical\ndynamics of this oscillator with allowance for the friction force is investigated. The development of the instability is traced in detail. In Conclusion (Sec. IV) the obtained results are\nsummarized and their relation to other studies in this field are noted.\n\nII.\n\nPAIS-UHLENBECK FOURTH ORDER OSCILLATOR: LAGRANGIAN AND\n\nHAMILTONIAN DESCRIPTIONS\n\nThe simplest higher derivative theory of a scalar field \u03c6(t, x) is defined by the equation [1]\n\u0013\u0012 2\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\n\u2202\n\u2202\n2\n2\n(2.1)\n\u2212 \u2206 + m1\n\u2212 \u2206 + m2 \u03c6(t, x) = 0 ,\n\u2202t2\n\u2202t2\nwhere \u2206 is the Laplace operator, m1 and m2 are the mass parameters. Upon passing to the\nmomentum space\n\u03c6(t, x) =\n\nZ\n\neipx \u03c6\u0303(t, p) d3 p\n\nequation (2.1) acquires the form\n\u0013\u0012 2\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\nd\nd\n2\n2\n+ \u03c91\n+ \u03c92 \u03c6\u0303(t, p) = 0 ,\ndt2\ndt2\nwhere \u03c9i2 = p2 + m2i ,\n\n(2.2)\n\n(2.3)\n\ni = 1, 2.\n\nWhen the space has zero dimension, we obtain from (2.3) the equation governing the\ndynamics of the respective point mechanical analog of the initial field theory (2.1), i.e., the\nPais-Uhlenbeck fourth order oscillator\n2\nd4 x\n2\n2 d x\n+\n(\u03c9\n+\n\u03c9\n)\n+ \u03c912 \u03c922 x = 0 ,\n1\n2\ndt4\ndt2\n\n3\n\n(2.4)\n\n\fwhere x \u2261 x(t) is the coordinate of this oscillator.\nThe general solution to this equation has the form\nx(t) = x1 (t) + x2 (t),\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhere\nxn (t) = an ei\u03c9n t + a\u2217n e\u2212i\u03c9n t ,\n\nn = 1, 2 .\n\n(2.6)\n\nHere an are complex amplitudes, the positive frequencies \u03c91 and \u03c92 are assumed to be\ndifferent and \u03c92 > \u03c91 . The case of equal frequencies \u03c91 = \u03c92 requires a special consideration [20, 21].\nEquation (2.4) is the Euler equation\n\u2202L\nd \u2202L\nd2 \u2202L\n\u2212\n+ 2\n=0\n\u2202x dt \u2202 \u1e8b dt \u2202 \u1e8d\n\n(2.7)\n\nfor the Lagrangian\n1\n1\n1\nL = \u2212 \u1e8d2 + (\u03c912 + \u03c922 ) \u1e8b2 \u2212 \u03c912 \u03c922 x2 .\n(2.8)\n2\n2\n2\nTransition to the Hamiltonian description is accomplished by making use of the Ostrogradski method [22]. Upon introducing the canonical variables\nq1 = x,\nq2 = \u1e8b,\nd \u2202L\n\u2202L\n\u2212\n= (\u03c912 + \u03c922 ) \u1e8b + \u1e8d,\np1 =\n\u2202 \u1e8b dt \u2202 \u1e8d\n\u2202L\n= \u2212\u1e8d\np2 =\n\u2202 \u1e8d\n\n(2.9)\n\nthe Ostrogradski Hamiltonian is constructed in the usual way\n\u00132\n\u0012\np21\n1 2 2 2 1 2 1 2\np1\n2\nH = p1 q\u03071 + p2 q\u03072 \u2212 L =\n.

If the inequality \u03c92 > \u03c91 holds, as\nwe have assumed above, then the contribution to the Ostrogradski energy of the oscillations\nwith the frequency \u03c91 is positive while the same with the frequency \u03c92 is negative. The\nenergy (2.13) is an integral of motion, and the fact that it can acquire negative values does\nnot lead to any physical contradictions. A different situation arises when the system under\nconsideration experiences external action.\n\nIII.\n\nPAIS-UHLENBECK OSCILLATOR WITH DAMPING\n\nLet us introduce the friction force into the equation of motion (2.4)\n2\ndx\nd4 x\n2\n2 d x\n2 2\n+\n(\u03c9\n+\n\u03c9\n)\n+\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\nx\n+\n\u03b3\n= 0,\n1\n2\n1\n2\ndt4\ndt2\ndt\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is a positive constant (friction coefficient). As before the time dependence of the\nsolutions to Eq. (3.1) is described by the factor ei\u03c9t , where the frequency \u03c9 is the root of\nthe equation\n\u03c9 4 \u2212 (\u03c912 + \u03c922 ) \u03c9 2 + \u03c912\u03c922 + 2i\u03b3\u03c9 = 0 .\n\n(3.2)\n\nIn order to simplify the calculations we assume that the damping is weak, so the perturbation theory is applicable. Substituting in Eq. (3.2)\n\u03c9 = \u03c9n + i\u2206\u03c9n ,\n5\n\nn = 1, 2 ,\n\n(3.3)\n\n\fwe arrive at the equation for \u2206\u03c9n . In the approximation linear in \u03b3 it reads\n2 \u03c9n2 \u2206\u03c9n \u2212 (\u03c912 + \u03c922 ) \u2206\u03c9n + \u03b3 = 0,\n\nn = 1, 2 .\n\n(3.4)\n\nThus, the frequency shifts for \u03c91 and \u03c92 prove to be real and equal in the absolute value\nbut they have the opposite signs\n\u03b3\n> 0,\n\u2212 \u03c912\n\u03b3\n\u2206\u03c92 = 2\n< 0,\n\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c922\n\u2206\u03c91 =\n\n(3.5)\n\n\u03c922\n\n(3.6)\n\nbecause we have assumed that \u03c92 > \u03c91 . As a result, the solution\nx1 (t) \u223c ei\u03c91 t\u2212\u2206\u03c91 t\n\n(3.7)\n\nexponentially decreases in time, while the solution\nx2 (t) \u223c ei\u03c92 t+|\u2206\u03c92 |t\n\n(3.8)\n\nexponentially increases in time. The damping behaviour of the solution x1 (t) is physically\nmotivated, namely, due to the external friction force the amplitudes a1 and a\u22171 in Eq. (2.14)\ndecrease in time and the energy E1 also decreases being positive. Unlike this, the amplitudes a2 and a\u22172 in Eq. (2.15) exponentially grow up and there are no reasons to stop this\nprocess, since the energy E2 , being negative, decreases without bound. Obviously such a\ndynamical behaviour is not acceptable from the physical stand point. Remarkably, for the\nboth solutions x1 (t) and x2 (t) the energy is conserved however in the latter case this holds\nonly formally.\nNow we consider the Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator which experiences an arbitrary force f (t):\n2\nd4 x\n2\n2 d x\n+\n(\u03c9\n+\n\u03c9\n)\n+ \u03c912 \u03c922 x = f (t) .\n1\n2\ndt4\ndt2\n\n(3.9)\n\nThe general solution to this equation can be expressed in terms of the relevant Green function\nx(t) =\n\nZ\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere\n1\nG(t) = \u221a\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\u221e\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nG(t \u2212 t ) f (t ) dt =\n\ni\u03c9t\n\ne\n\n\u1e20(\u03c9) d\u03c9,\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n6\n\nZ\u221e\n\n\u1e20(\u03c9) f \u0304(\u03c9) d\u03c9 ,\n\n(3.10)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n1\nf (t) = \u221a\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nei\u03c9t f \u0304(\u03c9) d\u03c9 .\n\n(3.11)\n\n\fFrom Eq. (3.9) we deduce in a straightforward way\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n1\n\u1e20(\u03c9) = 2\n\u2212\n.\n\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c922 \u03c9 2 \u2212 \u03c922 \u03c9 2 \u2212 \u03c912\n\n(3.12)\n\nNow we see from Eqs. (3.10) and (3.12), that the forces with spectral densities localized\naround \u03c912 and \u03c922 give rise to displacement y of opposite signs. Obviously, it implies that\none of these displacements is unphysical.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nBy making use of a simple and clear example, tractable analytically, we have shown that\nthe instability of the theories with higher derivatives implies the following. Introduction of\narbitrary weak interaction of such systems with surroundings results, for sure, in appearance\nof unbounded rising solutions. Being negative, the Ostrogradski energy for these solutions\ngrows up in absolute value without bound and there are no reasons to terminate this process.\nIt is worth noting that introduction of external nonpotential forces is crucial in our consideration. Indeed, in Ref. [23] an additional potential term was introduced in undamped\nPais-Uhlenbeck oscillator. It was shown there that indefiniteness of the energy does not\nforbid the stability in this case.\nOur inference does not imply at all that any theory with higher derivatives is unphysical\none at the classical level already. Indeed, let us consider, as an example, a dynamical\ntheory, which is described by two ordinary differential equations of the second order. Let\nthe dynamics of this system be stable (a conservative system with energy bounded from\nbelow). In the general case, these equations can be transformed into one differential equation\nof the fourth order. It maybe that the Ostrogradski energy for this equation proves to be\nunbounded from below. But it does not imply that the initial system of two equations\nis unstable with respect to external action. The point is, the Ostrogradski energy for the\none forth order equation does not coincides, in the general case, with the usual energy for\ntwo initial differential equations of the second order. The examples of such systems are\ndiscussed now in the literature. First of all, it is worth noting here the Timoshenko beam\ntheory which describes the transverse vibrations of an elastic beam or rod with allowance\nfor flexure bending and transverse shear deformation [17, 24, 25, 26, 27].\n\n7\n\n\fAcknowledgments\n\nThe discussion of Ostrogradski's instability and related topics with Richard Woodard,\nNeil Stephen, and Kwok Tung Chan is acknowledge with a gratitude.
