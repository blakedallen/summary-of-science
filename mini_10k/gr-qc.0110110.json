INTRODUCTION\n\nAlternative theories of gravity [1] represent an extension of General Relativity in which\nthe gravitational interaction is mediated by a tensor field and one or several scalar fields,\nin general massless. The Brans-Dicke (BD) theory of gravity [2] is, may be, the most\nfamous prototype of such theories which incorparates Mach's principle and Dirac's large\nnumber hypothesis (see, for example, [3]) by means of a nonminimal coupling between the\ngeometry and a scalar field \u03c6, the BD scalar. The scalar field rules dynamics together with\ngeometry and induces a variation of the gravitational coupling with time and space through\nthe relation Gef f = 1/\u03c6. The Newtonian gravitational constant GN is recovered in the limit\n\u03c6 \u2192 constant. As recent experiments [4,5] have shown, a variation of the Newton constant\non astrophysical and cosmological sizes and time scale seems to have been confirmed.\nDuring last years there has been a growing interest for the Brans-Dicke gravity, as well\nas for the alternative theories of gravity [1,6], due to the following reasons: i) The presence\nof scalar fields seems to be unavoidable in supersting theory [7]. ii) BD gravity follows from\nKaluza-Klein theory in which the compactified extra dimensions is essential for generating\nscalar fields [8]. iii) BD theory is an important ingredient in the scenario of extended and\nhyperextended inflation [9\u201312]. Besides, constraints of the coupling constant of BD theory\nare derived in relation to the observations of gravitational waves from compact binaries [13],\nwhereas investigations concerning the collapse to black holes in the framework of BD has\nbeen carried out in [14]. Recently, consequences of the BD gravitational field on neutrino\noscillations and Sagnac effect have been analyzed in [15] and [16], respectively. In this paper\nwe suggest a new physical effect which involves the Cerenkov emission by charged particles\npropagating in curved space-time.\nII. THE BD THEORY OF GRAVITY\n\nThe effective action describing the interaction of the scalar field \u03c6 nonminimally coupled\nwith the geometry and the ordinary matter is given by [2]\nA=\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\n\u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202 \u03bc \u03c6 16\u03c0\nd x \u2212g \u03c6R \u2212 \u03c9\n+ 4 Lm ,\n\u03c6\nc\n4\n\n#\n\n\"\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere R is the scalar curvature, Lm is the matter contribution in the total Lagrangian density. The constant \u03c9 can be positive or negative. In what follows we will assume \u03c9 > 0. On\nan experimental setting, \u03c9 is determined by observations and its value can be constrained by\nclassical tests of General Relativity: the light deflection, the relativistic perihelion rotation\nof Mercury, and the time delay experiment, resulting in reasonable agreement with all available observations thus far provided \u03c9 \u2265 500 [1,17]. The most recent bounds on \u03c9 comes from\nVery-Long Baseline Radio Interferometry (VLBI) experiment and it is given by \u03c9 > 3000\n[18]. On the other hand, bounds on the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background\nradiation (CMB) give the upper limit \u03c9 \u2264 30 [9]. Nevertheless, it must be mentioned that\nresults obtained in Refs. [19], in which the BD theory during the radiation matter equality\nhas been investigated, seem to indicate that at the moment there is no observable effect\nappearing from CMB. It is important to point out that Einstein's theory is recovered as\n2\n\n\f\u03c9 \u2192 \u221e. In this limit, the BD theory becomes indistinguishable from General Relativity in\nall its predictions (this is not always true, see for example [20\u201322]).\nVariation with respect to the metric tensor g\u03bc\u03bd and the scalar field \u03c6 yield the field\nequations [2]\nR\u03bc\u03bd\n\n1\n1\n1\n\u03c9\n8\u03c0\n\u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd R = 2 \u03c6,\u03bc \u03c6,\u03bd \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd \u03c6,\u03b1 \u03c6,\u03b1 + (\u03c6,\u03bc;\u03bd \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd \u2737\u03c6) + 4 T\u03bc\u03bd\n2\n\u03c6\n2\n\u03c6\nc\u03c6\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n(2.2)\n\nfor the geometric part, and\n2\u03c9\n\u03c9\n\u2737\u03c6 \u2212 2 \u03c6,\u03bc \u03c6,\u03bc + R = 0\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n\n(2.3)\n\nfor the scalar field. \u2737 is the usual d'Alembert operator in curved space\u2013time and T\u03bc\u03bd is the\nmomentum\u2013energy tensor of matter.\nThe line element describing a static and isotropic geometry is expressed as\nds2 = \u2212e2\u03b1 dt2 + e2\u03b2 [dr 2 + r 2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 )] ,\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere the functions \u03b1 and \u03b2 depend on the radial coordinate r.

THE CERENKOV EFFECT\n\nWe now investigate the possibility that a charge particle, propagating in a gravitational\nfield described by BD theory, could emit radiation through the Cerenkov process. Such a\nprocess has been analyzed some years ago by Gasperini [23]. Here we follow a different\napproach proposed in a recent paper by Gupta, Mohanty and Samal [24]: The Cerenkov\nprocess occurs owing to a different coupling of fermions and photons with the gravitational\nbackground. They show that the gravitational field acts as an effective refractive index,\nwhose expression is given by [24]\nn2T (k0 ) = 1 \u2212\n\nRii\nki k j R i j\n+\n,\n|\u03b7 00 |k02\n2k2 k02 |\u03b7 00 |\n\n(3.1)\n\nki k j R i j\n,\nk2 |\u03b7 00 | k02\n\n(3.2)\n\nfor the transverse modes, and\nn2L (k0 ) = 1 \u2212\n\nfor the longitudinal modes. Rii is understood as the sum over the spatial indices of the Ricci\nP\ntensor R\u03bc\u03bd , i.e. Rii \u2261 3i=1 Rii , k0 is the frequency of the emitted photon \u03b3 (k \u03bc = (k 0 , k),\nwith k = (k 1 , k 2 , k 3 )), and \u03b7 00 is the 00-component of the metric tensor in the inertial frame,\n\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd = (\u22121, 1, 1, 1).\nThe scattering process f (p) \u2192 f (p\u2032 ) + \u03b3(k), responsible of the Cerenkov radiation, is\nanalyzed in the local inertial frame of the incoming fermion f (p) with momentum p, while\nf (p\u2032 ) and \u03b3(k) are the outcoming fermion with momentum p\u2032 and the emitted photon with\nmomentum k. As one can immediately realize, the Cerenkov emission is not vanishing in\nthe inertial frame since the refractive index turns out to be proportional to the Ricci tensor\n[24].\nThe energy radiated via Cerenkov effect by a charged particle moving in a background\ngravitational field is given by\n\u0015\n\u0014\nn2\u03b3 (k0 ) \u2212 1\ndE\nQ2 \u03b1em Z k02\n1 2\nk\n=\nk\n,\ndk\np\n(p\n\u2212\nk\n)\n\u2212\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\ndt\n4\u03c0p20 k01\n2 0\nn2\u03b3 (k0 )\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere Q is the charge of the fermion emitting the photon, \u03b1em is the electromagnetic coupling\nconstant, and p0 is the energy of the fermion.

(3.1) and/or (3.2)) is greater than 1. To show that this occurs in BD\ntheory, we shall discuss some particular cases.\n- If the momentum of photons is directed as k = (k, 0, 0), and r \u226b B, then the last term in\n(3.1) and (3.2) reads\nki k j Rji\n1\nR11\n4BC\n4M\n\u223c 2 \u223c\u2212 3 2 \u223c 3 2\n,\n2\n2\n2\nk k0\nk0\nr \u03bbk0\nr c \u03c60 k0 2\u03c9 + 3\n\n(3.10)\n\nwhere Eqs.

(3.1) assumes the form\nn2T \u223c 1 +\n\n4M\n1\n\u03c9+1\n8M 2\n\u2212\n,\n2\n2\n2\nr 3 c2 \u03c60 k0 2\u03c9 + 3 r 4 c4 \u03c60 k0 (2\u03c9 + 3)2\n\n(3.12)\n\nwhich is greater than 1 being last term of the order O(r \u22124 ). The longitudinal refractive\nindex turns out to be lesser than 1, as follows from (3.2).\n\n5\n\n\f- As before observed, B is a constant related to the source mass, and C is an arbitrary\nconstant entering in the BD field equations describing the gravitational field (Eqs.\n(2.5)-(2.7)). The weak field solutions, Eqs. (2.9)-(2.12), are permissible only if the\ngravitational source is a suitable mass distribution, as for example the Sun, which\ngenerates everywhere a small field, inside and outside to it (see Eq. (3.12)). This does\nnot hold for a point mass source or, in the more general case, for high density of matter\n[2]. Let us consider the gravitational field generated by a source placed at the center\nof Galaxies. In such a case, the field weak approximation cannot be trivially used, at\nleast in the BD conjecture, because of the strong field regime inside the gravitational\nsource. This situation avoids of using the constraints (2.13). Thus, as follows from\n(3.1), (3.2) and (3.9), n2T > 1 provided Rii is negative and the last term in (3.1) and\n(3.2) is positive for \u03c9 > 0, C > 0 and for r sufficiently large with respect to B. The\ncondition Rii < 0 implies the constraint \u03c9C < 1. As expected, the effect disappears\nfor C = 0, i.e. when the static solution (2.5)-(2.6) reduces to the solution of Einstein's\ntheory.\n- One can also investigate the case \u03bb \u226b 1 (\u03c9 \u226b 1) and r \u226b B. Eqs. (3.5)-(3.7) and (3.9)\nbecomes\nR11\n\nB\n\u223c \u2212 3\u221a\nr \u03c9\n\nR22\n\nB\n\u223c \u221a ,\nr \u03c9\n\nR33\n\nB sin \u03b8\n\u223c \u221a ,\nr \u03c9\n\nRii\n\nB2\n\u223c 4 .\nr\n\nNotice these expressions do not depend on C. For photons propagating with momentum k = (k, 0, 0) the refractive indices are given by\nn2T \u223c 1 +\n\nB\nB2\n\u221a\n> 1,\n\u2212\nr 3 k02 \u03c9 r 4 k02\n\nn2L \u223c 1 \u2212\n\nB\n\u221a < 1.\nr 3 k02 \u03c9\n\nThe above results clearly show that the BD theory of gravity is a suitable framework for\nthe occurrence of the Cerenkov effect, showing up a departure from General Relativity.\nNevertheless, it must be noted that large bounds on \u03c9 yield a refractive index of the order\nn2\u03b3 \u223c O(1). Thus, from an experimental setting, the Cerenkov process is very difficult to be\ndetected.\nIV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have analyzed, in the framework of BD theory of gravity, the Cerenkov\nemission by a charged particle. Since the Cerenkov radiation occurs for particles with very\nhigh energy, the suitable context for producing it could be represented by astrophysical and\ncosmological scenarios. For example, one can envisage the studying of astrophysical objects\npresent at the center of Galaxies. Let us recall that it is widely believed that the central mass\nof Galaxies has to be a black hole described by General Relativity. But in our own galaxy, for\ninstance, if Sgr A\u2217 (the super-massive compact object name) is a black hole, its luminosity\nshould be three order of magnitude bigger than that which is observed. This discrepancy is\ncalled the blackness problem. In addition, observational data come from regions at a radius\n6\n\n\flarger than 4 \u00d7 104 Schwarzschild radius of a black hole of mass 2.6 \u00d7 106 solar masses -which\nis the inferred mass of the central object-, and so, proofs of the existence of a super-massive\nblack hole in the center of the galaxy are not conclusive (alternative models, in fact, have\nbeen proposed in [25,26]). It is then of current interest to edit the analysis of a super-massive\nstar placed at the center of galaxies whose gravitational field could satisfy the requirement of\nMach's principle and look for Cerenkov's radiation emitted by accelerated charged particles,\nwhich is an allowed process in the BD theory of gravity, but vanishes in the framework of\nGeneral Relativity. As a consequence, the detection of the Cerenkov radiation might give a\nstrong signature in favour of BD theory.\nIt would be interesting to extend this analysis to scalar tensor-theories theories of gravity\n(as well as higher order theories of gravity), in which the strength of the coupling between\nthe scalar field and gravity is determined by the function \u03c9(\u03c6). In the more general case, a\nself\u2013interaction potential V (\u03c6), which plays a non trivial role on the dynamics of the field,\ncan be also introduced. The dependence of the parameter \u03c9 on \u03c6 could have the property\nthat, at the present epoch, the value of the scalar field \u03c60 is such that \u03c9 is very large, leading\nto theories almost identical to General Relativity today, but for past or future values of \u03c6,\n\u03c9 could take values that would lead to significant differences from General Relativity, hence\nto an enhancement of Cerenkov effect. Such extension is currently under investigation.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nResearch supported by MURST PRIN 99.
