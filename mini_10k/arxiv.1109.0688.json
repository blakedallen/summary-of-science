However, the most known codes do not allow for\nEmail address: Email: bianconi@bs.infn.it (A. Bianconi).\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier\n\n4 December 2018\n\n\fsimulation of effects like azimuthal asymmetries in SIDIS, in e+ e\u2212 \u2192 hadrons,\nin Drell-Yan processes etc, i.e. those processes where the transverse spin of the\nquark has a relevance (for an overview of this field, see the proceedings [5],\nand the reviews [6] and [7]).\nAlthough it is possible to modify a Monte Carlo generator in such a way to\nproduce such asymmetries, the perspective of touching the core of such complicate codes is surely a nightmare for most of the people that are potentially\ninterested in. What I present here is a set of techniques aimed at introducing\n(transverse) spin physics in a generator without touching it at all. Of course\none needs writing patches of code, but these use the parton level and hadron\nlevel outputs of the generator 1 as an input, and are completely independent\n(small) programs.\nIn this work, I will consider e+ e\u2212 \u2192 hadrons. I will start from events generated\nby Pythia-8 [1]. I need to modify Pythia outputs in such a way that:\n(i) In the hard vertex e+ e\u2212 \u2192 q q\u0304, transverse polarizations are added to the\nquark and to the antiquark, and the correlated distribution of spins and momenta is coherent with the known matrix elements.\n(ii) The momenta of the final hadrons in each hemisphere (quark hemisphere\nand antiquark hemisphere) are modified in a way that is correlated with the\ntransverse spin of the parent quark. The modification must be under our full\ncontrol, i.e. we should be able to obtain exactly what we want to obtain. This\nmay mean a fragmentation function with pre-assigned form, or the implementation of a model.\nI will describe some techniques to implement the previous requirements. As\nan example, I will apply them to modify pion final momenta so to have them\ndistributed according with the sum of an unpolarized and a Collins fragmentation function[8]. Although here I just want to show an example of application\nof these simulation techniques, the chosen case is of special interest, since the\nCollins function has a relevant role in the extraction of information on the\ntransverse polarization of the nucleon[9], there are models for it [10,11,12],\nand it appears in asymmetries measured in SIDIS [13,14,15] and e + e\u2212 \u2192\nhadrons [18].\nAs a consequence of a nonzero Collins function, the correlated distribution of\npions detected in opposite hemispheres is expected to present a cos(\u03a61 + \u03a62 )\nasymmetry in the sum of the azimuthal angles of the pions [16] (see section\nVIII of [17] for details). This will be confirmed by an analysis of the events\ngenerated by Pythia and modified as suggested here.\n1\n\nThe most known MC generators show, in their output, the momenta of all the\nparticles produced in the intermediate stages of a complex event.\n\n2\n\n\fI will not try to reproduce the detailed physical outputs of the recent measurement of this quantity at Belle [18,19], because this is just an exercise and\nthe aim of this work is to present a more general group of techniques. Once\nthe individual hadron tracks have been modified in a physically motivated\nway, other azimuthal asymmetries could be generated in a set of simulated\nevents, like the cos(2\u03c6)\u2212asymmetry (see [17] and [19]), or dihadron-dihadron\ncorrelations [20,21], or even asymmetries associated with a larger number of\nparticles[22].\nLet me name NPMC the \"non polarized\" MonteCarlo code whose outputs\nhave to be modified by the external patches.\nThe two main steps, corresponding to previous (i) and (ii) are:\nStep (1): Take a q q\u0304 pair produced in the hard vertex by the NPMC and \"stick\"\na pair of reciprocally independent random transverse spins, in such a way that\nthe correlated spin-momentum distribution agrees with the polarized quarklepton squared matrix element. Transverse spins are assumed to be classical\nfixed-length vectors with one degree of freedom (the angle in the plane that\nis normal to the quark momentum).\nThis step is the critical point of the method. It needs to be demonstrated that\nit is feasible. One thing is to sort both momenta and spins according with a\njoint distribution, and another thing is first sorting momenta according with\nthe spin-averaged distribution (that is done by the NPMC), and next dividing\nthe sorted events into fairly distributed spin subsets (that is done by us).\nSection 2 is devoted to this.\nStep (2): Modify the (final or intermediate) hadronic momenta so to reproduce the effect of an assigned quark-spin-dependent fragmentation function.\nAlternatively, one could like to implement a physical model that is behind this\nfragmentation function.\nHere the underlying assumption is that azimuthal effects are a small distortion of a final particle distribution that is mainly determined by the physics\nimplemented in the NPMC. There are two classes of techniques that may\nbe exploited: \"distortion\", and \"filtering\" techniques. In distortion techniques\nthe individual particle properties in a given event are modified. These techniques exploit each event produced by the NPMC. In filtering techniques only\na subset of the events produced by the NPMC is accepted.\nFiltering may be expensive, when many NPMC-events are needed to obtain\none final event. It may be necessary when we think that the additional physical\nprocesses affect quantities like the final pion multiplicity, or the general structure of the event. If we do not expect this to be the case, distortion techniques\nare preferable.\n3\n\n\fIn section 3, I show the effect of two possible distortion techniques in producing\na nonzero Collins function for the pions.\nA cos(\u03a61 + \u03a62 )\u2212asymmetry involving pions of the opposite hemispheres is a\nsynthesis of the presence of Collins functions on both sides, and of the spin\ncorrelations between the quark and antiquark produced in the hard vertex.\nSo, if things in the steps (1) and (2) have been properly performed it must\nbe present. Section 4 is devoted to show that this is the case, i.e. that a\ncos(\u03a61 + \u03a62 )\u2212asymmetry is present in a set of Pythia-events modified by the\npresented techniques.\n\n2\n\nStep 1: Hard vertex and spin\n\nIn most MonteCarlo codes for high-energy physics, the starting point is the\nhard scattering process at parton level. Once a hard scattering event has been\nsorted according with some probability, both later and previous cascading\nprocesses are generated.\nMethod 1\n\n3500\n3000\n2500\n2000\n1500\n1000\n500\n0\n10.8\n0.6\n\nsz s\nz\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n-0.2-0.4\n-0.6-0.8\n\n-1\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n-0.6 -0.4\n\n0\n\n-0.8\n\n-0.2\n\n-1\n\n0.2\n\n0.6\n\n-0.2\n\n0.4\n\n-1\n\n-0.6 -0.4\n\n0\n\n-0.8\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\ncos(\u03b8)\n\nMethod 2\n3500\n3000\n2500\n2000\n1500\n1000\n500\n0\n10.8\n0.6\n\nsz s\nz\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n-0.2-0.4\n-0.6\n-0.8\n\n-1\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\ncos(\u03b8)\n\nFig. 1.

The two cross\nsections present a different form because they are expressed in different reference frames, but they are the same.\nIf the polarization components are averaged away, we get the known result\n\nWnopol (N\u0302) \u221d 1 + cos2 (\u03b8).\n\n(2)\n\nThe most known and used MonteCarlo codes implement this equation for\nthe lepton-quark vertex, adding further O(\u03b1sn ) hard processes in the partonic\nshowers.\n6\n\n\fo\n\nspin correlations at \u03b8 near 90\n3500\n3000\n2500\n2000\n1500\n1000\n500\n-1\n\n-0.8\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nsx sx + sy sy\n\ncos(\u03b8)-distribution for small sx sx + sy sy\n1350\n1300\n1250\n1200\n1150\n1100\n1050\n1000\n950\n900\n\n-1\n\n-0.8\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\ncos(\u03b8)\n\nFig. 5.

Lower panel: the cos(\u03b8\u2212)distribution, for \u22120.2 < sx s\u0304x + sy s\u0304y < 0.2.\nThe continuous line is obtained with Method 1, the dotted line with Method 2.\n\nIf we had to write from the very beginning a complete MonteCarlo generator\nincluding transverse polarizations of the quark and antiquark, we could imagine two ways of sorting momenta and spins of the quark and of the antiquark\n(generically: \"quarks\").\nMethod 1) The momenta and the spins of the quarks are jointly sorted according with the probability law eq.1.\nMethod 2) First, the momenta of the quarks are sorted accordingly with eq.2,\nand next the polarizations are sorted in such a way to get the distribution 1\nfor the joint set of variables N\u0302 , ~s, ~s\u0304.\nThe former one is the right one in general (if correctly implemented). The\nlatter method allows for splitting the generation process into two steps, one\nof which may be performed by an NPMC and the other one by our additional\ncode patches. I will show that in the case interesting us it produces the same\nresults of method 1.\nTo apply Method 2 here I take a quark-antiquark pair whose momenta have\nbeen sorted with probability Wnopol (N\u0302 ), and sort their spins according with\nthe distribution\n7\n\n\fD(N\u0302, ~s, ~s\u0304) =\n\nWpol (N\u0302 , ~s, ~s\u0304)\n\u2192 Wpol (N\u0302, ~s, ~s\u0304)\nWnopol (N\u0302)\n\n(3)\n\nsubject to the conditions\n~s * N\u0302 = ~s\u0304 * N\u0302 = 0,\n|~s| = 1, |~s\u0304| = 1.\n\n(4)\n\nIn eq.3, in general, D requires the denominator Wnopol . In this peculiar case it\nmay be removed since we sort a variable that is absent in this denominator.\nFor method 1 the implementation is more straightforward. Events are sorted\naccording with the probability distribution eq. 1, subject to the condition 4.\nIn the set of figures 1\u22125 the distributions of some variables and of their correlations are reported, calculated with both Method 1 and 2. These show that\nMethod 1 and 2 produce the same results.\nSince the full distribution shows a strong correlation between \u03b8 and sz s\u0304z on one\nside, and between \u03b8 and sx s\u0304x + sy s\u0304y on the other side, the scatter plot of these\npairs of variables is shown in figs. 1-2. These figures report the distribution\nof 100,000 events in the (cos\u03b8, A)\u2212plane, where A is sz s\u0304z (fig.1), sx s\u0304x + sy s\u0304y\n(fig.2), sx s\u0304x (fig.3).\nThe other figures show slices/integrals of the previous distributions. In fig.4\n(upper panel) I report the sz s\u0304z -distribution integrated over \u22120.5 < cos(\u03b8) <\n0.5. This region is relevant for the Collins effect that is suppressed for |cos(\u03b8)|\nnear 1. In the lower panel the spin-integrated cos(\u03b8)\u2212distribution is reported.\nIt reproduces the 1 + cos2 (\u03b8) shape within 5 %. In fig.5 (upper panel) I report\nthe distribution of sx s\u0304x + sy s\u0304y integrated over \u22120.5 < cos\u03b8) < 0.5. In the\nlower panel the distribution is the one of cos(\u03b8) for the integration range \u22120.2\n< sx s\u0304x + sy s\u0304y < 0.2. In the last case, the larger (fluctuating) discrepancies\nbetween the distributions obtained by the two methods have statistical origin,\nand are due to the relatively small number of events in each bin.\nConcluding this part, I may claim that Methods 1 and 2 give similar results,\nso it is licit to apply the polarization stage of method 2 to events sorted by\nsome independent generator that does not include spins.\n\n3\n\nStep 2: Reasonable choices for the distortion methods\n\nNow we need to modify the transverse momenta of the final hadrons in such\na way to reproduce an assigned distribution, that is correlated with the quark\n8\n\n\fpolarization. In an attempt to be as comprehensive as possible, I propose and\ntest two classes of methods, that I name \"product\" and \"convolution\". These\nshould fit the most obvious requirements.\nIn this section, I apply these methods to a set of 2-momenta that are gaussiandistributed in the xy\u2212plane with center of the distribution in the origin. They\nare supposed to be the transverse momenta of a set of final hadrons, originating\nfrom a parent quark that is directed along +\u1e91 and has polarization +x\u0302. After\ntesting the distorting methods on this simplified set, in the next section they\nwill be applied to a set of Pythia events.\n~T\nLet F0 (KT ) be the undistorted momentum distribution, that depends on K\n~ T | only. It depends on the longitudinal fraction Z (not explicitly revia |K\nported) and is proportional to the fragmentation function D1 (q \u2192 h; Z, KT ),\nwhere q is one or a group of quark flavors and h is one or a group of hadron\nspecies.

Apart for this, they do not present any special lack of generality.\nIn the examples of fig.6, as an undistorted and axially symmetric distribution\nF0 (KT ) I have chosen the gaussian\nF0 (KT ) = exp[\u2212(Kx2 + Ky2 )/(2k12 )]\n\n(10)\n\nwith k1 = 0.5 GeV/c.\nFor the product case I have applied eq. 5 with\n~T) =\nG(K\n1 +\n\n\u03b1Ky exp[\u2212(Kx2\n\n+\n\nKy2 )/(2k22 )]\n\n!\n\nwhen this expression is > 0, and\n(11)\n~ T ) = 0.\nG(K\n(12)\nwhen it is negative.\n11\n\n\fFor the example in fig.6 \u03b1 = 0.75 and k2 = 4 GeV/c >> k1 . At any step, the\nshift ~qT is sorted with qx = 0 and |qy | < 1 GeV/c. I have used N = 10 steps,\nbut already with 5 steps the final results converges towards the final required\ndistribution.\nFor the convolution case I have used\n\nG(~qT ) = \u03b1 qy exp[\u2212(qx2 + qy2 )/(2k32)] f or qy > 0,\nG(~qT ) = 0 f or qy < 0.\n(13)\nwith \u03b1 = 0.5 and k3 = 0.1 GeV/c. These parameters are chosen so that the\nconvolution produces a shift that is similar to the product case. The choices k2\n>> k1 (product case), and k3 << k1 (convolution case) lead to a similar result,\ni.e. avoiding that the final distribution is much broader than the starting one.\nThis permits us to appreciate the shifting effect, that in fig. 6 is highlighted\nby vertical lines showing the average point of each distribution.\n\nNo shift\n\nKy distributions with/without Collins effect\n\nEntries\nMean\nRMS\n\n1600\n1400\n\n40000\n0.0001095\n0.4995\n\nConvolution\nEntries 40000\nMean\n0.1935\nRMS\n0.5489\n\n1200\n1000\n800\n\nProduct\n\n600\n\nEntries 40000\nMean\n0.176\nRMS\n0.4663\n\n400\n200\n0\n-1.5\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\nKy\n\nFig. 6.

I do not give details on these points since they just\nrequire standard operations like frame rotations and vector projections. What\nis done is (1) the distortion of the hadron transverse momentum is produced\nin a frame where the parent quark (or antiquark) momentum and spin are\nalong the z and x axes (this reproduces the situation analyzed in the previous\nsection), (2) for the specific data analysis (i.e. extraction of the cos(\u03a61 +\n\u03a62 )\u2212distribution) each resulting hadron momentum is transferred to a frame\nwhere the lepton-quark scattering plane coincides with the a coordinate plane.\nThe Pythia-generated events are selected by the additional condition Thrust\n> 0.8. This excludes three-jet events, and in the case of Q slightly over 10\nGeV (i.e. over the value used here) it would exclude events of bb\u0304\u2212kind (see\nthe discussion in [19]). This cutoff is important, because the momentum-spin\ncorrelation calculated in the Appendix of the present work refers to \"light\"\nquarks, i.e. fermions for which it is licit to assume helicity conservation in the\nvector-fermion vertex. At Q = 10 GeV we have to include events starting from\nu\u016b, dd \u0304 ss\u0304 and cc\u0304 pairs. In the collision c.m. frame, the quark energy is 5 GeV.\nThe charm mass is \u2248 1.27 GeV/c2 . For this quark the first order correction\nto the UR relation E = P is m2 /2E \u2248 160 MeV << E, so the helicity\nnonconserving terms have small relevance. If gluon radiation processes with a\nlarge pT were included in the hard photon-quark vertex, the spin-momentum\ncorrelations would not be exactly as in eq. 1 (e.g. the quark momentum would\nbe modified by a non-collinear gluon radiation, and the large quark virtuality\nwould affect helicity conservation in the photon vertex). All these processes\nare excluded by the request Thrust > 0.8.\nAccording with e.g. [17] in presence of nonzero Collins functions on both sides\none expects a cross section of the form\nd\u03c3\n\u221d 1 + cos2 (\u03b8) D(z1 )D(z2 )\ndz1 dz2 d\u03a91 d\u03a92\n+ sin(\u03b8)cos(\u03a61 + \u03a62 )C(z1 )C(z2 ).\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(14)\n\nThe angle \u03b8 is the lepton-quark polar angle. \u03a61,2 are the angles of the pion\n13\n\n\ftransverse momenta w.r.t. the lepton-quark scattering plane.

Rather, I have\nreported the output corresponding to the distribution shifts reported in fig.6,\nincluding the \"no-shift\" case to have an estimator of the fake asymmetries due\nto the statistics and to the cutoffs.\n(\u03c6 +\u03c6 )-event distribution (convolution method)\n1\n\n2\n\n6600\n\n6400\n\n6200\n\n6000\n\n5800\n\n5600 -3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\u03c6 +\u03c6 (rad)\n1\n\n2\n\nFig. 7.

I\nhave not considered the flavor dependence of the spin-dependent fragmentation functions. I have only considered spin effects on pions. To include different\nfunctional forms, a dependence on z, flavor differentiation, azimuthal effects\non other hadron species (like kaons), would be a matter of more program lines,\nbut would not issue any further challenge.\n15\n\n\fThe same procedure could have been applied to an intermediate state hadron\nthat decayed into two hadrons like e.g. a \u03c1. Then the two decay hadrons would\npresent an extra fragmentation function of the kind H\u22a5 (see [28], [29]). On\nthe other side, to produce a function of the kind H < ([28], [29], in e+ e\u2212 \u2192\nhadrons it has been measured by [30]) modifications should be applied to\nthe relative momentum of the two final hadrons. These are straightforward\ngeneralizations of the work presented here. Another possible application is the\nproduction of polarized \u039b/\u039b\u0304 [31]. In this case one would sort a spin for this\nhadron correlated with the quark spin, and sort new momenta for the decay\nproducts according with the assigned spin.\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nI have started this work from events of the class e+ e\u2212 \u2192 hadrons, generated\nby an ordinary Monte Carlo code where the transverse polarizations of the\nquarks are not taken into account.\nA set of techniques have been presented to build code patches that do not\ntouch the Monte Carlo generator itself, but rather modify its outputs, both\nat parton and hadron level.\nThe first aim of these modifications is attributing a transverse spin to the\nquark and to the antiquark pair produced in the hard vertex, in such a way\nto get a physically sound distribution for the correlated set of quark momenta\nand spins produced in the hard vertex. To reach this, e+ e\u2212 events with production of polarized quarks have been generated according to a known and\ngeneral method. Next, an alternative two-step method for generating similar\nevents has been tested, where in the first step an unpolarized quark and an\nunpolarized antiquark are produced in the lepton annihilation, and in the second step both are polarized without touching the previously sorted momenta. I\nhave shown that the two methods produce the same distributions. This means\nthat it is licit to take an unpolarized quark-antiquark pair produced from an\nexternal generator and attribute a pair of polarizations to it according to the\nsecond step of the two-step method.\nThe second aim is to slightly modify the transverse momenta of the produced\nhadrons, in a way that is related to the spin of the parent quark or antiquark,\nand controllable. \"Controllable\" may mean two alternative possibilities: Either that a given physical model is implemented, or that we know the form of\nthe momentum distribution, or of the fragmentation function, that we want\nto obtain. Two classes of techniques have been presented, namely \"product\"\nand \"convolution\" techniques. The former group is suitable for producing final\ndistributions according with fragmentation functions of the form D(1 + H/D),\n16\n\n\fwhere D is the unpolarized fragmentation function and H a spin-dependent\nterm, like e.g. a Collins function. The \"convolution\" techniques are more appropriate for those cases where a model predicts that the final moment is a\nconvolution of two contributions, one due to the unpolarized physics, and the\nother one to polarization-related effects.\nAs a test case, this has been applied to modification of a set of Pythia events,\nso to produce an azimuthal asymmetry that derives from the combined effect\nof the Collins functions of two opposite-produced pions. This was just a test\ncase, the range of possible applications is quite large.\nAs a final and due observation, I remark that the events produced by the\nmethods described here, working on Pythia outputs, are not Pythia events.\nThey are modifications of Pythia events.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work is a \"side effect\" of a long series of thorough discussions with\nAlessandro Bacchetta, on the physics of the fragmentation functions and on\nthe tools to analyze them.\n\n6\n\nAppendix: Polarized quark \u2212 unpolarized lepton contraction H \u03bc\u03bd (sy , s \u0304y )L\u03bc\u03bd\n\nFor the procedure described in section 2 we need the contraction\nq 4 W \u2261 H \u03bc\u03bd L\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(15)\n\nof the quark-level hadronic and lepton tensors in the processes l+ l\u2212 \u2192 q q\u0304,\nwhere the final pair is constituted by a transverse-polarized quark and antiquark. This will be calculated for purely massless quarks and leptons, in the\ncenter of mass frame of the reaction.\nEq.15 gives, for assigned momenta of the electrons, the joint probability for\nsorting the momenta and the spins of the quark and the antiquark. In a lepton\nannihilation process, q has no probabilistic role since it is fixed.\nIn ref. [23] (see the Appendix of that work) the q 4 W factor was already calculated for the reversed process q q\u0304 \u2192 l+ l\u2212 , aimed at the Drell-Yan application.\nThe invariant result is the same in both cases, however relevant differences\nappear when one rewrites it in the reference frame where the transverse spins\n17\n\n\fneed to be generated. The present case is simpler than the Drell-Yan one\nand requires no approximations, since the leptons are always on the z\u2212axis,\nand the polarized quark and antiquark are exactly back-to-back. Because of\nthis, the transverse spins of the quark and of the antiquark are orthogonal\nto the same axis. The 4-vector associated to the quark spin is orthogonal to\nthe 4-momenta of the quark and of the antiquark. The former orthogonality\nis always true, the latter only for back-to-back pairs.\nI use the shortened notation for traces\nT [..] \u2261\n\n1\nT r[..].\n4\n\n(16)\n\nI use the definitions of the Berestevskij-Lifsits-Pitaevskij book [32] (better\nknown as the 4th book of the Landau-Lifsitz Course in Theoretical Physics).\nAs the only exception to this, I indicate k\u03bc \u03b3 \u03bc with the widespread notation k/\ninstead of using k\u0302 as was done in that book.\n\n6.1 The case of unpolarized quarks\n\nIf the quarks are unpolarized, we simply have\n\u03bc\u03bd\nHunpol\n\u2261 T [ k/\u03b3 \u03bc k\u0304/\u03b3 \u03bd ] = {k \u03bc , k\u0304 \u03bd } \u2212 (k * k\u0304)g \u03bc\u03bd\n\n= {k \u03bc , k\u0304 \u03bd } \u2212\n\nq 2 \u03bc\u03bd\ng\n2\n\n(17)\n\nand\nq 2 \u03bc\u03bd\ng\n(18)\n2\nwhere braces indicate symmetric dyadic product. The contraction of the two\nis faster using\nL\u03bc\u03bd \u2261 {p\u03bc , p\u0304\u03bd } \u2212\n\n{k\u03bc , k\u0304\u03bd }{p\u03bc , p\u0304\u03bd } = 2 [(kp)(k\u0304 p\u0304) + (k p\u0304)(k\u0304p)],\n\u0012\n\n{k\u03bc , k\u0304\u03bd } \u2212 (k k\u0304)g\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u0013\n\ng \u03bc\u03bd = 0.\n\n(19)\n\n(20)\n\nWe get\nq 4 Wunpol \u2261 T [ k/\u03b3 \u03bc k\u0304/\u03b3 \u03bd ] T [ p/\u03b3\u03bc p\u0304/\u03b3\u03bd ] =\n2 [(kp)(k\u0304 p\u0304) + (k p\u0304)(k\u0304p)].\n18\n\n(21)\n\n\fI extract a factor q from each vector:\nk \u03bc \u2261 (q/2)N \u03bc , p\u03bc \u2261 (q/2)n\u03bc , ...\n\n(22)\n~\nIn a center of mass frame of the partonic process, the 3-vectors N , ~n etc are\nunitary vectors. I get\nWunpol =\n\n1\n[(Nn)(N\u0304 n\u0304) + (N n\u0304)(N\u0304 n)].\n8\n\n(23)\n\nA more familiar way to write this may be\nWunpol =\n\n1\n[1 + cos2 (\u03b8)].\n4\n\n(24)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the angle between the lepton and quark directions in the partonic\ncenter of mass frame.\n6.2 polarized quarks\nIn the case of polarized (anti)quark, we need to substitute\nk/ \u2192 k/(1 \u2212 \u03b3 5 /s)\n(25)\n\u03bc\nwhere s is the polarization 4-vector for the quark, respecting the exact 4dimensional constraint (sk) = 0. If each spin is exactly transverse to the\ncorresponding momentum, then also ~s * ~k = 0.\nThe relation between s\u03bc and the polarization in a rest frame ~\u03c3 is, for massive\nparticles,\ns0 = \u03c3L |~k|/m, sL = \u03c3L E/m, ~sT = ~\u03c3T\n(26)\nand evidently it creates problems for m \u2248 0, unless the longitudinal component\nis strictly zero. However, when the previous expressions are used to write the\ndensity matrix eq.25 in terms of the rest frame polarizations, E/m\u2212terms\ncancel and we may check that the density matrix is free from mass singularities:\nk/(1 \u2212 \u03b3 5 /s) = k/[1 \u2212 \u03b3 5 (\u00b1\u03c3L + ~\u03c3T * \u03b3T )].\n\n(27)\n\n(\u00b1 differentiates particles and antiparticles).\nAlthough it is not the aim of this particular work, it is useful to consider what\nwould be the outcome for longitudinally polarized quarks, with helicities h\nand h\u0304:\n\nWunpol \u2192 Wh,h\u0304 =\n(1 \u2212 hh\u0304)Wunpol \u221d (1 \u2212 hh\u0304)[1 + cos2 (\u03b8)].\n19\n\n(28)\n\n\fThis is a predictable and known result for massless fermions: pairs with the\nsame helicity are suppressed since they have opposite longitudinal spins in the\nc.m., i.e. total longitudinal spin zero. This cannot be transferred immediately\nto the transverse spin, since any helicity component is composed by 50 %\n\u00b1 components along any chosen transverse axis. In addition, the 1 + cos2 (\u03b8)\nfactor is a composition of Y00 and Y10 eigenfunctions of the orbital angular\nmomentum along the z\u2212axis, not along a transverse axis. So, while eq.28\ncould be guessed from the very beginning, a statement like \"the transverse\nspins of the pair are mostly parallel\" has not a solid a priori justification.\nThe full trace for polarized quarks is\n\u03bc\u03bd\nHs,s\u0304\n\u2261 T [ k/\u03b3 \u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b3 5 /s) k\u0304/\u03b3 \u03bd (1 \u2212 \u03b3 5 /)]\ns\u0304\n5 1\n\nthat excluding O (\u03b3 )\n\n!\n\n(29)\n\nterms (these would lead to an antisymmetric tensor,\n\nthat is useless when contracted with the symmetric tensor of the unpolarized\nleptons) reduces to\n\u03bc\u03bd\nHs,s\u0304\n\u2261 T [ k/\u03b3 \u03bc k\u0304/\u03b3 \u03bd ] + T [ k/\u03b3 \u03bc \u03b3 5 /s k\u0304/\u03b3 \u03bd \u03b3 5 /]\ns\u0304\n\n(30)\n\n= T [ k/\u03b3 \u03bc k\u0304/\u03b3 \u03bd ] \u2212 T [ k/\u03b3 \u03bc /s k\u0304/\u03b3 \u03bd /].\ns\u0304\n\n(31)\n\nNext I use the reduction formula\nT (abcdef ) = g ab T (cdef ) \u2212 g ac T (bdef ) +\n+ g ad T (bcef ) \u2212 g ae T (bcdf ) + g af T (bcde)\n\n(32)\n\n(with the obvious notation T (ab...) \u2261 T [\u03b3 a \u03b3 b ...]). For any of the remaining\ntraces we have the better known relation\nT (abcd) = g ab g cd \u2212 g ac g bd + g ad g bc\n\n(33)\n\nThe composition of eqs. 32 and 33 produces 15 terms. Applied to the second\nterm of eq. 31, two of these terms contain the products (sk) = 0 and (s\u0304k\u0304) = 0\nand are dropped.\nIn the specific case of the transverse spins for a back-to-back q q\u0304 pair we also\nhave (s\u0304k) = 0 and (sk\u0304) = 0. So most terms are dropped and we are left with\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed[1 \u2212 (ss\u0304)] * H \u03bc\u03bd\n\nunpol\n\n\uf8f6\n\nq2 \u03bc \u03bd \uf8f8\n\u2212\n{s , s }\n2\n\n(34)\n\nAfter contracting the hadron tensor with the (unpolarized) lepton tensor, the\nfinal result is\n20\n\n\fWsT s \u0304T\n\n\uf8eb\n\n1\n= \uf8ed[1 + cos2 (\u03b8)](1 + sz s\u0304z )\n4\n\n\uf8f6\n\n2\n\n\u2212 sin (\u03b8)(sx s\u0304x + sy s\u0304y )\uf8f8\n\n(35)\n\nHere I have used eq.24. The appearance of nonzero sz , s\u0304z terms should not\nconfuse about the transverse nature of the considered spins. These terms appear because the z\u2212axis is parallel to the lepton momentum, not to the quark\nmomentum.\nThe si s\u0304i \u2212terms may have two different origins in the previous invariant equations: from terms like (ss\u0304), and from terms like (sp)(s\u0304p\u0304). When passing to\n3-dimensional components, both terms change sign. The former because (ss\u0304)\n\u2192 \u2212(~s * ~s\u0304). The latter term presents two such changes of sign, and a third due\nto the opposite space parts of p\u03bc and p\u0304\u03bc .\n\nReferences\n\nReferences\n[1] T. Sjostrand, S. Mrenna, and P.
