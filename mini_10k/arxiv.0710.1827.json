By eliminating the leading contribution from three-\u03c0 + interactions, particular\ncombinations of these n-\u03c0 + ground-state energies provide precise extractions of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 + scattering\nlength in agreement with that obtained from calculations involving only two \u03c0 + 's. The three-\u03c0 +\ninteraction can be isolated by forming other combinations of the n-\u03c0 + ground-state energies. We\nfind a result that is consistent with a repulsive three-\u03c0 + interaction for m\u03c0 <\n\u223c 352 MeV.\n\nA major goal of strong-interaction physics is to determine the spectrum and interactions of hadrons and nuclei\nfrom Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Lattice QCD\nis the only known way to rigorously compute stronginteraction quantities, and an increasing effort is being\nput into understanding the lattice QCD calculations that\nwill be required to extract even the most basic properties\nof light nuclei. It is clear that at some level, the interactions among three or more hadrons play a significant role\nin nuclei, and an important goal for lattice practitioners\nis to determine the parameters of these interactions. We\nreport on the first lattice QCD calculation of systems\ncomprised of more than two hadrons.\nThe simplest multi-hadron systems (both conceptually, and from a numerical perspective) consist of n pseudoscalar mesons of maximal isospin. Interactions among\nmultiple pions are important to explore for phenomenological reasons. Two- and three-pion interferometry is\ncurrently being used to determine the coherence of the\npion source in heavy-ion collisions [1]. Further, multipion interactions impact the formation of a pion condensate which is energetically favored in systems with large\nisospin chemical potential, and will influence the properties of (hot) pion gases. In this work we perform lattice\nQCD calculations of the ground-state energies of \u03c0 + \u03c0 + ,\n\u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 + , \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 + , and \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 + systems in a\nspatial volume of V \u223c (2.5 fm)3 with periodic boundary conditions and a lattice spacing of b \u223c 0.125 fm.\nThese systems provide an ideal laboratory for investigating multi-particle interactions, as chiral symmetry\nguarantees relatively-weak interactions among pions, and\nmultiple-pion correlation functions computed with lattice\nQCD do not suffer from signal-to-noise issues that are expected to plague analogous calculations in multi-baryon\nsystems. The \u03c0 + \u03c0 + scattering length is extracted from\n\nthe n > 2 pion systems with precision that is comparable to (and in some cases better than) the n = 2 determination [2]. Additionally, a result that is consistent\nwith a repulsive three-pion interaction of magnitude expected from naive dimensional analysis (NDA) is found\nfor m\u03c0 <\n\u223c 352 MeV.\nAt finite volume, the ground state energy of a system\nof n bosons of mass M is shifted from its infinite volume value, n M . In a periodic cubic spatial volume of\nperiodicity L, this shift is known to be [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n\u0012 \u0013(\n\u0003\n4\u03c0 a n\na I \u0010 a \u00112 \u0002 2\n\u2206E n =\n+\n1\u2212\nI + (2n \u2212 5)J\n3\nML 2\n\u03c0L\n\u03c0L\n)\ni\n\u0010 a \u00113 h\n\u0001\nI 3 + (2n \u2212 7)IJ + 5n2 \u2212 41n + 63 K\n\u2212\n\u03c0L\n\u0012 \u0013 2 3\n\u0012 \u0013 L\n\u0001\nn 8\u03c0 a\nn \u03b73\n+\nr+\n+ O 1/L7 ,\n(1)\n3 L6\n2 M L6\nwhere a and r are the two-boson scattering length and\nthe effective range parameter, respectively, and \u03b7 L\n3 is the\nrenormalization-group invariant (RGI) three-boson interaction (\u03b7 L\n3 is renormalization-scheme and scale independent, but depends logarithmically on L; in terms of the\nthree-particle interaction defined in Ref [8], \u03b7 L\n3 = \u03b73 (\u03bc)+\n\u221a\n64\u03c0a4\n96 a4\n(3\n3\n\u2212\n4\u03c0)\nlog(\u03bc\nL)\n\u2212\n[2Q\n+\nR]).\nThe\ngeomet2\nM\n\u03c0 M\nric constants appearing in Eq.

Combinations involving \u2206E 2,3,5 and \u2206E 2,4,5 that\nvanish at this order can also be constructed.\nThe requisite ground-state energies are extracted from\nthe n-\u03c0 + correlation functions defined by\nD hX\nin E\nCn (t) = 0\n\u03c7\u03c0+ (x, t)\u03c7\u03c0+ (0, 0) 0 , (5)\nx\n\nwhere \u03c7\u03c0+ (x) = ua (x)\u03b35 da (x) is an interpolating operator for the \u03c0 + (a is a color index). The sums in Eq. (5)\nproject the correlation functions onto the A+\n1 representation of the cubic symmetry group (in the continuum\nthis corresponds to angular momentum ` = 0, 4, . . .). As\nn increases, the number of Wick contractions involved\nin computing Cn (t) increases as n!2 . In the limit of\nisospin symmetry, the correlation functions in Eq. (5)\nwith n < 13 require the computation of only a single\nquark propagator, S(x; 0) (for n > 12 additional propagators are required to circumvent the Pauli exclusion).\nAs an example, the n = 3 correlator can be expressed as\n\u0002 \u0003\n\u0002 \u0003\n3\nC3 (t) = tr [\u03a0] \u2212 3 tr [\u03a0] tr \u03a02 + 2 tr \u03a03 , (6)\nP\nwhere \u03a0 = x \u03b35 S(x, t; 0)\u03b35 S \u2020 (x, t; 0) and the trace is\nover Dirac and color indices.\nIn this work we have computed C1,2,3,4,5 (t) in\nmixed-action lattice QCD, using domain-wall valence\nquark propagators from Gaussian smeared-sources on\n\nthe rooted-staggered coarse MILC gauge-configurations\n(203 \u00d764) after HYP-smearing and chopping (see Refs. [2,\n10] for details). These are computed at pion masses of\nm\u03c0 \u223c 291, 352, 491, 591 MeV.

A lattice spacing of b = 0.125 fm has been used to\nconvert from lattice to physical units. The number of gauge\nconfigurations is Ncfg , and the number of sources per configuration is Nsrc . For further details see Ref. [2].\n\nThe energies of n pion states are dominated by the n\nsingle-pion energies, with the interactions contributing a\nsmall fraction of the total energy. To extract the resulting\nenergy shifts, \u2206En , the ratios of correlators\nGn (t) =\n\nCn (t) t\u2192\u221e \u2212\u2206En t\n,\nn \u2212\u2192 Ae\n[C1 (t)]\n\n(7)\n\nare formed, where the second relation holds in the limit of\ninfinite temporal extent and infinite number of gauge configurations. Inclusion of the effects of temporal boundaries (here Dirichlet boundary conditions are used) is\ncomplicated for multi-hadron systems, and our analysis is\nrestricted to regions where an effective-mass plot clearly\nshows that the ground state is dominant.\nFor the quantities discussed below, both jackknife and\nbootstrap analyses of the correlators and effective masses\n(e.g., log [Gn (t)/Gn (t \u2212 1)]) are performed for each energy or combination thereof. These are then used in\ncorrelated and uncorrelated fits to the t dependence to\nextract the relevant quantity. Our systematic uncertainties are determined by comparison of our different analysis procedures and variation of the fit ranges. To avoid\nuncertainties arising from scale setting, we focus on the\nL\ndimensionless quantities m\u03c0 a\u03c0+ \u03c0+ and m\u03c0 f\u03c04 \u03b7 L\n3 (\u03b7 3 is\n\u22121 \u22124\nexpected to scale as m\u03c0 f\u03c0 by NDA).\nThe \u03c0 + \u03c0 + scattering length (more precisely, the combination a\u03c0+ \u03c0+ ) has been studied repeatedly in lattice\nQCD using the finite-volume formalism of L\u00fcscher [6] (for\na/L \u001c 1 a perturbative expansion gives the n = 2 case of\nEq. (1)). In particular, a precise extraction of this scattering length has been performed using the same propagators as used in this work [2]. Therefore, the utility\nof multi-pion energies in extracting the scattering length\ncan be ascertained, as summarized in Figs. 1, 2 and 3.\nIn Fig. 1, the energy shifts for n = 2, 3, 4, and 5\nare displayed for the highest-precision calculation, m\u03c0 \u223c\n\n\f3\n\nlog@GnHtL\u0090GnHt-1LD\n\n0.10\n\nrelation functions with those of n = 2, {n, m} = {3, 4}\nand {n, m} = {4, 5}.

Since multiple combinations\nof pions interact in an n-pion state over a larger volume\nof the lattice, a statistically-improved signal results.\nFigure 2 presents extractions of the scattering length\nat all four orders in the 1/L expansion in Eq.

Significant dependence on n is observed in the lower-order\nextractions (LO, NLO and NNLO), indicating the presence of residual finite-volume effects. However the most\naccurate extractions using Eq.

They are all consistent with zero and\nare <\n\u223c 0.05.\nFurther lattice QCD calculations are required before a\ndefinitive statement about the physical value of the threepion interaction, m\u03c0 f\u03c04 \u03b7 L\n3 , can be made. While at lighter\npion masses, there is evidence for a contribution to the\nvarious n-pion energies beyond two body scattering that\nscales as the three-body contribution in Eq. (1), a number of systematic effects must be further investigated.\nThe extraction of this quantity has corrections that are\nformally suppressed by a/L, however, the coefficient of\nthe higher order term(s) may be large, and the next order term in the volume expansion needs to be computed\n(for n = 3, this result is known [9]). It is also possible\nthat the signals seen in Fig. 4 are artifacts of the lattice\ndiscretization,\nbut the observed scaling that is consistent\n0 1\nnA\n@\nwith\nsuggests this is not the case. However, calcula3\n\ntions at a finer lattice spacings and with different lattice\ndiscretizations are required to resolve this issue.\nAs the lattice QCD study of nuclei is an underlying\nmotivation for this work, it is worth considering difficulties that will be encountered in generalizing the result described here to baryonic systems. Certain difficulties have been discussed in Ref. [8]. Here we focus on\nthe numerical issues. The ratio of signal-to-noise scales\nvery poorly for baryonic observables [11], requiring an\nexponentially-large number of configurations to extract\na precise result. Also, the factorial growth of the com-\n\nIn this work we have numerically studied the groundstate energies of n = 2, 3, 4, 5 \u03c0 + 's in a cubic volume\nwith periodic boundary conditions using lattice QCD. We\nfind that the \u03c0 + \u03c0 + scattering length can be extracted\nfrom combinations of these energies that eliminate the\nthree-\u03c0 + interaction, and agree with previous n = 2 calculations [2]. In some cases the precision of the extraction is improved. We have found evidence of a repulsive\nthree-\u03c0 + interaction for m\u03c0 <\n\u223c 352 MeV. Future calculations will extend these results to larger n and to systems\ninvolving multiple kaons and pions. Further, calculations\nmust be performed in different spatial volumes to determine the leading correction (O(1/L)) to the three-\u03c0 +\ninteraction, and at different lattice spacings in order to\neliminate finite-lattice spacing effects, which are expected\nto be small.\nWe thank M.
