The\nnumerical calculations for the Compton process ep \u2192 e\u03b3X at the HERA collider were\nperformed in the Born approximation. The various distributions in the CMep and Breit\nframes are presented. These cross sections are dominated by the transversely polarised\nintermediate photon, even for large Q2 .\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn cross sections for semi-inclusive ep processes and collisions with two intermediate photon, the terms coming from the interference between \u03b3L\u2217 and \u03b3T\u2217 or between two different\ntransverse states of \u03b3 \u2217 can appear [2]. The detailed studies of various contributions for\nthe process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 performed for the kinematical range of the PLUTO and\nLEP experiments[3] show the importance of interference terms.\nHere we study the longitudinal-transverse interference term (d\u03c4LT ) and contributions due to exchange of \u03b3L\u2217 (d\u03c3L ) and \u03b3T\u2217 (d\u03c3T ) in the unpolarised semi-inclusive ep\ncollisions [1]. Assuming one-photon exchange we factorise the cross-section onto the photon emission by the electron and the \u03b3 \u2217 p collision in a way independent on the reference\nframe. For this purpose we use the propagator decomposition method and explicit forms\nof all polarisation vectors of the virtual photon (q 2 < 0).\n\n2\n\nFactorisation formulae for unpolarised ep collisions\n\nThe cross section for an unpolarised lN \u2192 lX process, for example DIS ep \u2192 eX, can\nbe factorised onto the leptonic and hadronic tensors, d\u03c3 \u223c L\u03bc\u03bd W\u03bc\u03bd . Further on the\ndifferential cross section can be decomposed on the parts related to the subprocesses\n\u03b3T\u2217 N \u2192 X and \u03b3L\u2217 N \u2192 X, respectively:\nd\u03c3 ep\u2192eX = \u0393T \u03c3T\u03b3\n\n\u2217 p\u2192X\n\n+ \u0393L \u03c3L\u03b3\n\n\u2217 p\u2192X\n\n.\n\n1\nPresented at X International Workshop on Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS 2002),\nCracow, 30 April - 4 May 2002\n\n1\n\n(1)\n\n\fThe above factorisation and separation formula can be obtained in various ways. One of\nthem uses the known hadronic tensor and explicit form of the scalar polarisation vector[4].\nAnother way is the propagator decomposition method[5] in which the cross section is\nwritten as follows\ng\u03b1\u03bc g\u03bd\u03b2\nWp\u03bc\u03bd .\n(2)\nd\u03c3 ep\u2192eX \u223c L\u03b1\u03b2\ne\nq2 q2\nAfterwards one decomposes the propagator of the exchanged photon using the completeness relation, what leads directly to Eq. (2). This method is especially useful in analysing\nof the semi-inclusive processes.\n2\n\ne (k0 )\ne (k)\nq\n\n\u0003 ( )\n\np\n\n(\n\n)\n\np (p)\n\n\u0018\n\ng \u0016\nq2\n\nIm\n\n\u0017\n\n\u0016\n\ng\u0017\nq2\n\nX\nt\n\n=0\n\nFigure 1: The optical theorem for the Compton process ep \u2192 e\u03b3X.\nIn case of the semi-inclusive process one additional particle in the final state is\nproduced. For example for the Compton process ep \u2192 e\u03b3X (Fig. 1) the differential cross\nsection can be decomposed as follows:\nep\u2192e\u03b3X\n.\n+ d\u03c4LT\nd\u03c3 ep\u2192e\u03b3X = d\u03c3Tep\u2192e\u03b3X + d\u03c3Lep\u2192e\u03b3X + d\u03c4Tep\u2192e\u03b3X\nT\n\n(3)\n\nIn the above formula two additional contributions, d\u03c4LT and d\u03c4T T , appear. They are\nrelated to the interference between \u03b3L\u2217 and \u03b3T\u2217 , and between two different transverse polarisation states of the \u03b3 \u2217 , respectively.\ne (k 0)\n\ne (k )\n\n\u0003\n\n(q )\n\n(p )\n\ne (k 0 )\n\ne (k )\n\n\u001e\nFigure 2: The azimuthal angle \u03c6 for the process ep \u2192 e\u03b3X in the Breit frame.\n2\n\n\fIn studies of the interference terms in the semi-inclusive processes ep \u2192 e\u03b3X the\nazimuthal angle \u03c6 distribution is especially useful. The angle \u03c6 is defined as the difference\nof the azimuthal angle of the final electron and of the final photon: \u03c6 = \u03c6e \u2212 \u03c6\u03b3 .\nIn the Breit frame \u03c6 is the angle between the electron scattering plane and plane\nfixed by the momenta of the exchanged \u03b3 \u2217 and final photon \u03b3. In this reference frame\nd\u03c3/d\u03c6 is linear in cos \u03c6, cos 2\u03c6, sin \u03c6 and sin 2\u03c6. For calculations in the Born approximation the terms containing sin \u03c6 and sin 2\u03c6 vanish as a consequence of time-reversal\ninvariance, so the azimuthal distribution for the Compton process reduces to the following form [7]:\nd\u03c3 ep\u2192e\u03b3X\n= \u03c30 + \u03c31 cos \u03c6 + \u03c32 cos 2\u03c6 .\n(4)\nd\u03c6\nThe coefficients \u03c30 , \u03c31 and \u03c32 are related to d\u03c3T /d\u03c6, d\u03c3L /d\u03c6, d\u03c4LT /d\u03c6 and d\u03c4T T /d\u03c6. The\nthird term arises from the interference between two different transverse polarisation states\nof the exchanged photon (\u03c32 cos 2\u03c6 = d\u03c4T T /d\u03c6). The longitudinal-transverse interference\ngives rise to the second term (\u03c31 cos \u03c6 = d\u03c4LT /d\u03c6). The \u03c30 consists of the sum of the\ncross sections with the intermediate \u03b3L\u2217 and \u03b3T\u2217 (\u03c30 = d\u03c3L /d\u03c6 + d\u03c3T /d\u03c6). Therefore the\n\u03c6 distribution in the Breit frame is an excellent tool to identify and study interference\nterms.\n\nd\u03c3/dQ2 [pb/GeV 2 ]\n\nNumerical results for Compton process ep \u2192 e\u03b3X\n103\n102\n101\n100\n10\u22121\n10\u22122\n10\u22123\n\nd\u03c3/(dY dpT ) [pb/GeV ]\n\n3\n\n104\n102\n100\n10\u22122\n10\u22124\n10\u22127\n10\u22128\n\nd\u03c3\nd\u03c3\u0302T\nd\u03c3L\n| d\u03c4LT |\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n60\n2\nQ [GeV 2 ]\n\n80\n\n100\n\n102\n100\n10\u22122\n\n0\n\n40 80 120 160\npT (CMep ) [GeV ]\n\n10\u22124\n10\u22127\n10\u22128\n\n-4 -2 0 2\nY (CMep )\n\n4\n\nFigure 3: Contributions to d\u03c3/dQ2 (at the top) and to d\u03c3/(dpT dY ) (below) as a functions\nof pT with Y = 0 (on left) or Y with pT = 5 GeV (on right), in CMep .\nWe calculate various contributions to the cross sections for the unpolarisedqCompton process ep \u2192 e\u03b3X in both the CMep and Breit frames for the HERA energy Sep =\n300 GeV.

For the proton we have used the CTEQ5L parton\nparametrization [8] with Nf = 4 and the hard scale equals to pT .\nThe cross section d\u03c3/dQ2 , (Fig. 3, top) is strongly dominated by contribution\ndue to the transversely polarised \u03b3 \u2217 , even for large values of virtuality Q2 . Also the cross\nsections d\u03c3/(dpT dY ) (Fig. 3, bottom), as a function of pT or rapidity Y , are very well\ndescribed by the \u03b3T\u2217 cross section only . Both contributions coming from the \u03b3L\u2217 , d\u03c3L and\nd\u03c4LT , are below 10%, moreover due to opposite signs they almost cancel each other.\n0.16\n0.14\n0.12\n0.1\n0.08\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n0\n\nCMep frame\nBreit frame\n\n0\n\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n\nQ2 [GeV 2]\n\nFigure 4: The ratio [d\u03c3L /dQ2 ] / [d\u03c3T /dQ2 ] as a function of Q2 , in the CMep frame (solid\nline) and in the Breit frame (dashed line).\nThe ratio [d\u03c3L /dQ2 ] / [d\u03c3T /dQ2 ] (Fig. 4) shows interesting Q2 dependence in\ntwo reference frames (CMep and Breit frame). We see that domination of the cross sections by \u03b3T\u2217 is stronger in the CMep frame in which d\u03c3L and d\u03c4LT almost cancel each other.\nFor the azimuthal angle distribution in Breit frame the relatively large sensitivity\nto the interference term d\u03c4LT is found (Fig. 5), while the interference between two different\ntransverse polarisation states of \u03b3 is invisible.\n0.13\n\nd\u001b=d\u001e (pb)\n\n0.12\n0.11\n0.1\n0.09\n0.08\n0.07\n0.06\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\u001e (rad:)\n\nFigure 5: The d\u03c3/d\u03c6 in the Breit frame.\n2\n\nThe cross section for the Bethe-Heitler process, i.e. production of the \u03b3 from the electron line, can\nbe neglected for the photon's rapidity range Y (CMep ) < 0 [6].\n\n4\n\n\f4\n\nConclusions\n\nOur analysis show that the cross section for the Compton process (the Born level) in CMep\nis strongly dominated by \u03b3T\u2217 . If the contributions due to \u03b3L\u2217 are included then interference\nterms need to be included in a consistent analysis because they both are similar in size\nbut opposite in sign.\nThe studies of the azimuthal angle dependence, d\u03c3 ep\u2192e\u03b3X /d\u03c6, in the Breit frame\ngive access to the longitudinal-transverse interference term.\nI would like to acknowledge Maria Krawczyk for fruitful discussions and for reading manuscript.\n\nReferences\n[1] U.
