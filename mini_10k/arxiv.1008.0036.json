Introduction\nUltracold atomic gases have attracted considerable interest1\u20133) since the successful realization of Bose-Einstein condensation in a bosonic\n\n87 Rb\n\nsystem.4) One of the most active topics\n\nin this field is the study of fermionic optical lattice systems, which are formed by loading ultracold fermions into a periodic potential.5\u20138) This setup provides a clean realization of a quantum\nlattice system, in which remarkable phenomena have been observed such as the Mott insulating state9, 10) and the BCS-BEC crossover in two component fermionic systems.11\u201313) Due\nto the high controllability of the lattice structure and onsite interactions, ultracold fermionic\nsystems in optical lattices can be regarded as quantum simulators of the Hubbard model,\nwhose ground-state properties have been investigated by numerous theoretical and computational approaches. Recent papers have suggested the possible realization of optical lattice\nsystems described by other theoretical models such as multi-component models14\u201316) and the\nKondo lattice model.17\u201319) This stimulates further investigations on lattice models with strong\ncorrelations. Among them, the periodic Anderson model (PAM) describing conduction and\nlocalized bands is one of the most important models in condensed matter physics. It captures\nthe essential physics of some heavy-electron systems realized in rare-earth compounds.20) An\n\u2217\n\nE-mail address: koga@phys.titech.ac.jp\n1/16\n\n\fJ. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n\nFull Paper\n\nimportant point is that quantum critical behavior is expected in the PAM with both repulsive\nand attractive interactions, and the model may thus provide a stage to discuss a quantum\nphase transition in an optical lattice system. However, this type of instability, which may\nbe important to predict the low-temperature properties of optical lattice systems, has not\nbeen discussed in the PAM with attractive interactions. Furthermore, the confining potential\nshould play a crucial role in understanding the quantum critical behavior in optical lattice\nsystems with attractive interactions. Therefore, it is important to systematically investigate\nthe low temperature properties in this model with localized and itinerant bands.\nIn this paper, we study the PAM with attractive interactions by combining dynamical\nmean-field theory (DMFT)21\u201324) with the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo (CTQMC)\napproach.25) First, we discuss how the superfluid state is realized on a uniform bipartite lattice\nand determine the phase diagram. By examining the dynamical properties in the superfluid\nstate in detail, we demonstrate that low energy in-gap states are induced in the density of\nstates. We also discuss the effect of the confining potential by means of the real-space DMFT\nand investigate how the Kondo insulating state spatially competes with the superfluid state.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we introduce the model Hamiltonian and\nexplain the particle-hole transformation in the PAM. We briefly summarize our theoretical\napproach. We demonstrate how the superfluid state competes with the Kondo insulating state\nat low temperatures in Sec. 3. The effect of the confining potential is discussed in Sec. 4. A\nbrief summary is given in the last section.\n2.

Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n\nFull Paper\n\nand Ef is the energy level for the localized band. \u03bcc (\u03bcf ) and hc (hf ) are the chemical potential\nand the magnetic field for the conduction (localized) band. In the following, we refer to the\nconduction and localized bands as c and f bands, for simplicity.\nFirst, we wish to note that the low-energy properties of the PAM with attractive interactions [eq. (1)] are closely related to those of the repulsive PAM. This can be understood by\napplying a particle-hole transformation to the model on the bipartite lattice. It is explicitly\ngiven by\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 c \u2192 \u03c3c\u0303\u2020\ni\u03c3\ni\u03c3\n\uf8f3 f \u2192 \u2212\u03c3 f \u0303\u2020\ni\u03c3\ni\u03c3\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 c \u2192 \u2212\u03c3c\u0303\u2020\nj\u03c3\nj\u03c3\n\uf8f3 f \u2192 \u03c3 f \u0303\u2020\nj\u03c3\n\nj\u03c3\n\ni \u2208 A,\n\n(4)\n\nj \u2208 B,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere A and B are sublattice indices, and c\u0303i\u03c3 (f \u0303i\u03c3 ) annihilates a particle in the c (f ) band on\nthe ith site with spin \u03c3. We then obtain the PAM with repulsive interactions \u0168 (= \u2212U ), where\nthe energy level for the f band, chemical potentials and magnetic fields are transformed as\n\u1ebcf = 0, \u03bc\u0303f = hf , \u03bc\u0303c = hc , h\u0303f = Ef \u2212 \u03bcf , and h\u0303c = \u03bcc , respectively. In particular, the low\ntemperature properties of both models are equivalent at half filling (Ef = 0, \u03bca = 0, ha = 0),\nwhich is similar to the case of the Hubbard model.26)\nThe low-temperature properties of the PAM with repulsive interactions, which have been\ndiscussed in the context of f electron systems,20) may be helpful to understand those of our\nattractive model. In the repulsive PAM, the hybridization between the c and f bands favors\nthe formation of a local Kondo singlet state. Therefore, a large hybridization stabilizes the\nKondo insulating state at half filling and the heavy metallic state away from half filing.27, 28)\nOn the other hand, the Coulomb repulsion favors magnetic correlations between sites, which\ntends to induce an antiferromagnetically ordered state.29\u201333) Therefore, in the half-filled PAM\non a bipartite lattice, a quantum phase transition occurs between the Kondo insulating state\nand the antiferromagnetically ordered state in two and higher dimensions. Note that this\ncompetition is controlled by not only the interaction strength but also the magnetic field. If\na magnetic field is applied, the spin gap in the Kondo insulating state decreases and finally\nvanishes. At this point, a field-induced magnetic phase transition occurs, where a spontaneous\nstaggered magnetization appears in the plane perpendicular to the applied field.34\u201336)\nIn the PAM with attractive interactions, a similar competition is expected at low temperatures. The corresponding ordered phase should be characterized by a pair potential \u2206,\n\n3/16\n\n\fJ. Phys. Soc.

This quantity corresponds to the staggered\nP\nmagnetization in the x direction max = N1 i (\u22121)i h\u00e3\u2020i\u2191 \u00e3i\u2193 + \u00e3\u2020i\u2193 \u00e3i\u2191 i in the PAM with repulsive\ninteractions. By contrast, it is known that the Kondo insulating state has no order parameter\n\nsince it is adiabatically connected to the paramagnetic state at high temperatures. This implies\nthat it is also realized in the PAM with attractive interactions.\nTo discuss how the superfluid state competes with the Kondo insulating state, we make use\nof DMFT. Since local particle correlations can be taken into account precisely, this method is\nformally exact in the limit of infinite dimensions, and has successfully been applied to strongly\ncorrelated systems. In DMFT, the lattice Green's function is obtained via a self-consistency\ncondition imposed on the impurity problem.

Therefore, it is necessary that the impurity solver\nis capable of treating different energy scales accurately. The exact diagonalization method37)\nis efficient to discuss ground state properties, but it is difficult to quantitatively discuss the\ncritical behavior and dynamical properties at finite temperatures. The numerical renormalization group method38, 39) is one of the most powerful methods to describe the low energy states,\nbut may not be appropriate for investigating the higher energy region. In this paper, we use\nthe recently developed CTQMC method. In this approach, a Monte Carlo sampling of certain\ncollections of diagrams is performed in continuous time, and thereby the Trotter error, which\noriginates from the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition, is avoided. The CTQMC method comes in\ntwo flavors, a weak-coupling25) and strong-coupling40) formalism, and is applicable to general\nclasses of models such as the Hubbard model,41\u201346) the periodic Anderson model,47) the Kondo\nlattice model,48) and the Holstein-Hubbard model.49) Here, we use the continuous-time auxiliary field version of the weak-coupling CTQMC method50) extended to the Nambu formalism,\nwhich allows us to directly access the superfluid state at low temperatures.45) In our CTQMC\nsimulations, we measure normal and anomalous Green's functions on a grid of a thousand\npoints. To discuss static and dynamical properties in the system quantitatively, the number\nof CTQMC samplings in each DMFT iteration is changed, depending on the temperature,\nthe chemical potential, and the magnitude of the hybridization: e.g. we have performed eighty\nmillion (five billion) samplings for the half-filled system with U = 1, V = 0.40, and T = 0.02\n(U = 1, V = 0.18 and T = 0.01). In the following, we set \u03bc = \u03bcc = \u03bcf and h = hc = hf = 0,\nfor simplicity.\n3. Periodic Anderson model on the hypercubic lattice\n\nWe first consider the PAM on the infinite-dimensional hypercubic lattice. The bare density\n\u221a\nof states for the c band is Gaussian with the bandwidth t\u2217 : \u03c1(\u03c9) = exp[\u2212(\u03c9/t\u2217 )2 ]/ \u03c0t\u22172 . In\nthis section, we use t\u2217 as the energy unit. The normal state properties have been discussed\nin detail by means of DMFT, and the phase diagram has been obtained from the divergence\nof the staggered susceptibility at finite temperatures.30\u201333) However, the off-diagonal ordered\nstate has not been discussed directly since it cannot easily be treated. Here, we combine DMFT\n5/16\n\n\fJ. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n\nFull Paper\n\nwith the CTQMC method based on the Nambu formalism to discuss how the superfluid state\nis realized at low temperatures.

The inset shows the critical behavior of the pair potentials.\nSolid lines are guides to eyes.\n\npotential is zero and the normal state is realized. As temperature is decreased below a critical\nvalue, the pair potentials for both bands are simultaneously induced, which implies a phase\ntransition to the superfluid state. By examining the critical behavior \u2206 \u223c |T \u2212 Tc |\u03b2 with the\nexponent \u03b2 = 1/2, we determine the critical temperature Tc \u223c 0.023, as shown in the inset of\nFig. 1.\nHowever, the superfluid state is not always realized at low temperatures in the PAM. By\nperforming similar calculations for several values of the hybridization V , we find, as shown in\nFig. 2, three distinct regions: V < Vc1 , Vc1 < V < Vc2 and Vc2 < V . The two critical points\nare obtained as Vc1 \u223c 0.26(0.18) and Vc2 \u223c 0.36(0.37) at T = 0.02(0.01). To clarify the nature\nof these states, we show the density of states obtained by the maximum entropy method in\nFig. 3. When V > Vc2 , the pair potential is zero and a charge gap appears around the Fermi\nlevel in each band. This implies that the large hybridization stabilizes the Kondo insulating\nstate at half filling. In the intermediate region (Vc1 < V < Vc2 ), the superfluid state is realized\nsince the system has finite pair potentials and the corresponding gap in the density of states.\nNote that no drastic change in the density of states appears at V = Vc2 , in contrast to the\npair potential. A similar behavior has been discussed in the half-filled Kondo lattice model.51)\nOn the other hand, when V < Vc1 , a finite density of states appears around the Fermi level\nin each band. This implies that a normal metallic state is realized.\n6/16\n\n\fJ. Phys. Soc.

The normal state is realized at higher temperatures, while\na different behavior appears at lower temperatures, depending on the magnitude of the hybridization. In the small V case, the system is reduced to the non-interacting c band weakly\ncoupled to the correlated f band, which makes the critical temperature for the superfluid\nstate rather low. Therefore, the normal metallic region shrinks as temperature is decreased,\nVc1 \u2192 0 (T \u2192 0), as shown in Fig. 4. On the other hand, we find that the other critical\npoint Vc2 between the superfluid state and the Kondo insulating state is slightly increased as\ntemperature is lowered. We expect that at zero temperature, the superfluid state is realized\nin the small V region and a quantum phase transition occurs to the Kondo insulating state\nat Vc2 (\u223c 0.38). This is consistent with ground-state properties for the PAM with repulsive\ninteractions31) and the Kondo lattice model,42, 48) where the Kondo insulator competes with\nthe magnetically ordered state.\nNow, let us consider how the Kondo insulating state competes with the superfluid state\naway from half filling. In the following, we show only the pair potential \u2206f since \u2206c behaves esP\nsentially the same. In Fig. 5, we show the local particle density at each site n(= ai\u03c3 hnai\u03c3 i/N )\nand the pair potential \u2206f when the chemical potential is varied. Here, we show only the local\n\nparticle density at T = 0.02 in Figs. 5 (a), (b) and (c) since n(T = 0.01) is almost identical. In\naddition, the compressibility \u03ba(= \u2202n/\u2202\u03bc) deduced from the numerical derivative is also shown\nin Fig. 5 (d). This quantity corresponds to the magnetic susceptibility in the z direction in\nthe repulsive PAM. Therefore, a cusp singularity is naively expected at the critical point.\nWhen V = 0.3, the half-filled system (\u03bc = 0) is in the superfluid state at low temperatures,\n7/16\n\n\fJ. Phys. Soc.

Shifting the chemical potential away from zero, the pair potential is little\naffected and the local particle density varies smoothly, as shown in Fig. 5 (a). Therefore, we\nconclude that the superfluid state is stable against small changes in the chemical potential.\nFar away from half filling, the pair potential decreases and finally reaches zero. A phase transition then occurs to the normal metallic state. By contrast, a different behavior appears in\nthe case V = 0.35. The pair potential initially increases as the chemical potential is shifted\naway from zero, has a maximum value around \u03bc \u223c 0.05, and finally vanishes at the phase\ntransition, as shown in Fig. 5 (b). The nonmonotonic behavior is even more clearly evident\nin the case V = 0.4, as shown in Fig. 5 (c). When \u03bc < \u03bcc1 , where \u03bcc1 \u223c 0.049(0.032) at\nT = 0.02(0.01), the pair potential is zero and the local particle density is little changed. In\nfact, Fig. 5 (d) shows the strong suppression in the compressibility. This implies that an incompressible Kondo insulating state is realized at half filling, instead of the superfluid state.\nAn increase in the chemical potential beyond \u03bcc1 drives a chemical potential-induced superfluid phase transition, marked by the appearance of the pair potential and a cusp singularity\n8/16\n\n\fJ.

Further increase leads to\n10/16\n\n\fJ. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n\nFull Paper\n\ninteresting behavior in the density of states. We find that around \u03bc \u223c 0.05, the upper peak\nnever approaches the Fermi level and low energy states are, instead, induced below the Fermi\nlevel between the two peaks. This implies that particles in the vicinity of the Fermi level form\nCooper pairs, which yields low-energy in-gap states. The latter interpretation is consistent with\nthe fact that the chemical potential-induced superfluid phase transition occurs at \u03bcc1 \u223c 0.032.\nWhen the chemical potential increases beyond the critical point, the low-energy feature grows\nand becomes the dominant peak. It is also found that as the chemical potential is varied, the\ncenter of the gap is always located at the Fermi level, in contrast to the case with \u03bc < \u03bcc1 .\nOn the other hand, the peak at the lower edge of the hybridization gap becomes smeared.\nTherefore, we conclude that a compressible superfluid state is stabilized in this region. When\nthe system approaches \u03bcc2 (\u223c 0.14), the superfluid gap collapses and another phase transition\noccurs to the normal metallic state. A similar behavior is also found in the density of states\nof the c band, as shown in Fig. 7 (b). We emphasize that our calculation directly treats the\nlow temperature superfluid state, in contrast to previous works for the PAM.34\u201336) Figure 7\ntherefore clarifies how the chemical potential-induced phase transition yields low energy in-gap\nstates in the density of states.\nThe results obtained above may have important consequences for three-dimensional optical\nlattice systems. In particular, one might expect quantum critical behavior in the vicinity of\na certain surface in the three-dimensional optical lattice system if the confining potential is\nregarded as a site-dependent chemical potential. In the following section, we study the effect\nof the confining potential carefully to discuss the competition between the Kondo insulating\nstate and the superfluid state in such optical lattice systems.\n4. Effect of the confining potential\nWe study here the effect of the confining potential in the PAM. As discussed in the previous\nsection, we have found that the Kondo insulating state competes with the superfluid state\nat low temperatures. Furthermore, it has been clarified that in a certain parameter region, a\nshift of the chemical potential can stabilize the superfluid state. Therefore, if the confining\npotential is simply regarded as a site-dependent chemical potential, the Kondo insulating\nstate and the superfluid state may be separated by a quantum critical surface in the threedimensional optical lattice system. In this case, the critical temperature should depend on the\nposition in the trap. However, the physics in the presence of a trap is highly nontrivial and\ntherefore it is necessary to discuss the low temperature properties using more sophisticated\ntools.\n11/16\n\n\fJ. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n\nFull Paper\n\nTo this end, we use the real-space DMFT. The method is based on the local approximation,\nbut intersite correlations are to some extent taken into account. In fact, the real-space DMFT\napproach has been successfully used to discuss low temperature properties of optical lattice\nsystems46, 52\u201354) and the interface between transition metal oxides.55) Here, making use of\nthis method, we consider a three-dimensional optical lattice system. The Hamiltonian for the\nconfining potential is defined as,\nHc\n\n=\n\nX\n\nv(ri )nai\u03c3 ,\n\n(13)\n\nia\u03c3\n\nwhere v(r) = v0 (r/a)2 , v0 is the curvature of the confining potential, ri is the distance between\nthe ith site and the center of the trap, and a is the lattice constant. In this section, we fix\nt = 1 and v0 = 0.1. We then treat a system with 4169 sites restricted by the condition\n(r/a \u2264 10). Using the CTQMC method as an impurity solver, we perform the real-space\nDMFT calculations. We obtain results for the spatial distributions of the local particle density\nand the pair potentials for the system with U = 3.5 and \u03bc = 0.5, as shown in Fig. 8.

By contrast, the noninteracting c\n\nparticles are widely distributed due to the hopping integral between sites, as shown in the\ninset of Fig. 8 (a). In this case, no pair potential appears and the metallic state is realized.\nAn increase in the hybridization affects the distribution of the f band and low-temperature\nproperties. When V = 1.5, the local particle density around the center is decreased and the\npair potential is induced in the system, as shown in Fig. 8. Therefore, the superfluid state is\nrealized in the whole region with n(r) 6= 0 although the pair potential is tiny away from the\ncenter, as shown in the inset of Fig. 8 (b). This behavior is similar to that in the attractive\nHubbard model with a confining potential.46) Note that the rapid decay in the pair potential\nsets in around r/a = 1, in contrast to the distribution of the local particle density. This may\nbe explained by the competition between the Kondo insulating state and the superfluid state.\nWe find a shoulder structure around r/a = 2 in the local particle density, which indicates a\ntendency to form the Kondo insulating state in the superfluid state. This results in the rapid\ndecay of the pair potential. Further increase in the hybridization tends to result in a plateau\nstructure and decreases the pair potential. When V = 2.0, the pair potential vanishes and\nthe plateau clearly appears at a value of n(r) corresponding to half of the states occupied.\nTherefore, the Kondo insulating state is stabilized in the core region with r/a . 3.\nWith these calculations, we have clarified that the Kondo insulating state spatially competes with the superfluid state in an optical lattice system with confining potential. However,\nwe could not find a critical surface between the superfluid state and the Kondo insulating state,\nwhich could naively be expected from the results of the infinite dimensional PAM. Therefore,\nwe can say that intersite correlations play an important role and must be considered in a\ndiscussion of the low temperature properties of optical lattice systems.\nBefore concluding the paper, we would like to comment on correlation effects in the c\nband, which can be tuned by the Feshbach resonance in optical lattice systems. According to\nprevious studies of the PAM with repulsive interactions, these interactions do not affect the\nlow temperature properties qualitatively.56, 57) Therefore, it is expected that in the attractive\ncase, the essence of the low temperature properties must be described by the simple PAM [eq.\n(1)] although phase boundaries may be slightly shifted by interactions between the c particles.\n\n13/16\n\n\fJ.

By combining DMFT with the CTQMC method based on the Nambu\nformalism, we have studied quantitatively how the superfluid state is stabilized at low temperatures. It has been found that a low-energy state characteristic of the superfluid phase\nappears in the hybridization gap near the critical chemical potential. We have also discussed\nthe effect of the confining potential in the three-dimensional optical lattice by means of the\nreal-space DMFT to clarify how the superfluid state spatially competes with the Kondo insulating state.\nAcknowledgement\nThis work was partly supported by the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research 20740194\n(A.K.) and the Global COE Program \"Nanoscience and Quantum Physics\" from the Ministry\nof Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan.
