Introduction\nIn geometry, the kissing number in n-dimensional Euclidean space is the maximal\nnumber of non-overlapping unit spheres which simultaneously can touch a central\nunit sphere. The kissing number is only known in dimensions n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 24,\nand there were many attempts to find good lower and upper bounds. We refer to\nCasselman [4] for the history of this problem and to Pfender, Ziegler [14], Elkies\n[7], and Conway, Sloane [6] for more background information on sphere packing\nproblems.\nBachoc and Vallentin [1] develop a method (Section 2 recalls it) to find upper\nbounds for the kissing number based on semidefinite programming. Table 1 in\nSection 3, the main contribution of this paper, gives the values, i.e. the first ten\nsignificant digits, of these upper bounds for all dimensions 3, . . . , 24. In all cases\nthey are the best known upper bounds. Dimension 5 is the first dimension in which\nthe kissing number is not known. With our computation we could limit the range of\npossible values from {40, . . . , 45} to {40, . . . , 44}. In Section 4 we show that the high\naccuracy computations for the upper bounds in dimension 4 result into a question\nabout a possible approach to prove the uniqueness of the kissing configuration in 4\ndimensions.\nAlthough acquiring the data for the table is a purely computational task we think\nthat providing this table is valuable for several reasons: The kissing number is an\nimportant constant in geometry and results can depend on good upper bounds for\nit. For instance in Section 5 we show that there is no periodic point set in dimension\nDate: June 26, 2009.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 11F11, 52C17, 90C10.\nKey words and phrases. kissing number, semidefinite programming, average theta series, extremal modular form.\nThe second author was partially supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)\nunder grant SCHU 1503/4.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nH.D.

Furthermore, the actual computation of the table was very challenging. Bachoc and\nVallentin [1] gave results for dimension 3, . . . , 10. However, they report on numerical difficulties which prevented them from extending their results. Now using new,\nmore sophisticated high accuracy software and faster computers and more computation time we could overcome some of the numerical difficulties. Section 3 contains\ndetails about the computations.\n2. Notation\nIn this section we set up the notation which is needed for our computation. For\nmore information we refer to [1].

New upper bounds for the kissing number (best known values are underlined).\n\n\fHigh accuracy semidefinite programming bounds for kissing numbers\n\n5\n\nFinding the solution of the semidefinite program defined in Section 2 is a computational challenge. It turns out that the major obstacle is numerical instability\nand not the problem size. When d is fixed, then the size of the input matrices stays\nconstant with n; when n is fixed, then it grows rather moderately with d.\nThere is a number of available software packages for solving semidefinite programs. Mittelmann compares many existing packages in [10]. For our purpose\nfirst order, gradient-based methods such as SDPLR are far too inaccurate, and second order, primal-dual interior point methods are more suitable. Here increasingly\nill-conditioned linear systems have to be solved even if the underlying problem is\nwell-conditioned. This happens in the final phase of the algorithm when one approaches an optimal solution. Our problems are not well-conditioned and even\nthe most robust solver SeDuMi which uses partial quadruple arithmetic in the final\nphase does not produce reliable results for d > 10.\nWe thus had to fall back on the implementation SDPA-GMP [8] which is much\nslower but much more accurate than other software packages because it uses the\nGNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library. We worked with 200\u2013300 binary digits\nand relative stopping criteria of 10\u221230 . The ten significant digits listed in the table\nare thus guaranteed to be correct. One problem was the convergence. Even with\nthe control parameter settings recommended by the authors of SDPA-GMP for \"slow\nbut stable\" computations, the algorithm failed to converge in several instances.\nHowever, we found parameter choices which worked for all cases: We varied the\nparameter lambdaStar between 100 and 10000 depending on the case while the\nother parameters could be chosen at or near the values recommended for \"slow\nbut stable\" performance.\nThe computations were done on Intel Core 2 platforms with one and two Quad\nprocessors. The computation time varied between five and ten weeks per case for\nd = 12. An accuracy of 128 bits in SDPA-GMP did yield sufficient accuracy but did\nnot yield a reduction in computing time.\nAfter the computations for the cases d = 11 and d = 12 were finished new 128bit versions (quadruple precision) of SDPA and CSDP became available; partly with\nour assistance. These new versions do not rely on the GNU Multiple Precision\nArithmetic Library. So the computation time for the cases d = 13 and d = 14 were\nreasonable: from one week to two and a half weeks.\n4. Question about the optimality of the D4 root system\nLooking at the values sd (4) in Table 1 one is led to the following question:\nQuestion 4.1. Is lim sd (4) = 24?\nd\u2192\u221e\n\nIf the answer to this question is yes (which at the moment appears unlikely\nbecause we computed s15 (4) = 23.06274835 . . . ), then it would have two noteworthy\nconsequences about optimality properties of the root system D4 .\nThe root system D4 defines (up to orthogonal transformations) a point configuration on the unit sphere S 3 = {x \u2208 R4 : x * x = 1} consisting of 24 points; it is\nthe same point configuration as the one coming from the vertices of the regular 24\ncell. This point configuration has the property that the spherical distance of every\ntwo distinct points is at least arccos 1/2. Hence, these points can be the maximal\n24 touching points of unit spheres kissing the central unit sphere S 3 .\n\n\f6\n\nH.D. Mittelmann, F. Vallentin\n\nIf limd\u2192\u221e sd (4) = 24, then this would prove that the root system D4 is the\nunique optimal point configuration of cardinality 24. Here optimality means that\none cannot distribute 24 points on S 3 so that the minimal spherical distance between two distinct points exceeds arccos 1/2. Thus, the root system D4 would be\ncharacterized by its kissing property. This is generally believed to be true but so\nfar no proof could be given.\nAnother consequence would be that there is no universally optimal point configuration of 24 points in S 3 as conjectured by Cohn, Conway, Elkies, Kumar [5].\nUniversally optimal point configurations minimize every absolutely monotonic potential function. The conjecture would follow if the answer to our question is yes:\nEvery universally optimal point configuration is automatically optimal and Cohn,\nConway, Elkies, Kumar [5] show that the root system D4 is not universally optimal.\n5. Nonexistence of a sphere packing\nOur new upper bound of 7355 for the kissing number in dimension 16 implies\nthat there is no periodic point set in dimension 16 whose average theta series equals\n(1)\n\n1 + 7680q 3 + 4320q 4 + 276480q 5 + 61440q 6 + * * * .\n\nThis settles a conjecture of Conway and Sloane [6, Chapter 7, page 190]. In this\nsection we explain this result. We refer to Conway, Sloane [6], Elkies [7], and to\nBowert [2] for more information.\nAn n-dimensional periodic point set \u039b is a finite union of translates of an ndimensional lattice, i.e. one can write \u039b as \u039b = (AZn + v1 ) \u222a . . . \u222a (AZn + vN ),\nwith v1 , . . . , vN \u2208 Rn , and A : Rn \u2192 Rn is a linear isomorphism. The average theta\nseries of \u039b is\n\u0398\u039b (z) =\n\nN N\n1 X X X kAv\u2212vi +vj k2\nq\n, with q = e\u03c0iz .\nN i=1 j=1\nn\nv\u2208Z\n\nThis is a holomorphic function defined on the complex upper half-plane. A holomorphic function f which is defined on the complex upper half-plane, which is\nmeromorphic for z \u2192 i\u221e, and which satisfies the transformation laws\nf (\u22121/z) = z 8 f (z), and f (z + 2) = f (z) for all z \u2208 C with Iz > 0,\nis called a modular forms of weight 8 for the Hecke group G(2). The expression (1)\ndefines the unique modular form of weight 8 for the Hecke group G(2) which starts\noff with 1 + 0q 1 + 0q 2 . It is also called an extremal modular form, see Scharlau and\nSchulze-Pillot [15]\nIf there would be a 16-dimensional periodic point set whose average theta series\ncoincides with (1) then this periodic point set would define the sphere centers of\na sphere packing with extraordinary high density (see [6, Chapter 7, page 190]).\nAt the same time the existence of such a periodic point set would show that the\nkissing number in dimension 16 is at least 7680. This is not the case.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Etienne de Klerk and Renata Sotirov for initiating our collaboration\nand we thank Frank Bowert and Rudolf Scharlau for bringing the conjecture of\nConway and Sloane to our attention.\n\n\fHigh accuracy semidefinite programming bounds for kissing numbers\n\n7\n\nReferences\n[1] C.
