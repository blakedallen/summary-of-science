The Fermi ball is stabilized owing to the dynamical balance\nof the shrinking force due to the surface energy and the volume energy, and the expanding\nforce due to the Fermi energy. The Fermi ball is thought to be a candidate for one kind of\ncold dark matter in the present universe [5].\nMacpherson and Campbell pointed out that such stability holds good only for the spherical shape of the Fermi ball [1]. They further showed that the Fermi ball is not stable against\nthe deformation of the spherical shape, and thus flattens and fragments into tiny Fermi\nballs. The destabilization is caused by the volume energy of the Fermi ball.\nWe, however, pointed out that the perturbative correction due to the domain wall curvature can stabilize the Fermi ball when the volume energy is small enough compared to the\ncurvature effect [6, 7]. In case of a simple model with a single fermion flavor, we found that\nonly in the quite narrow region of the parameters does the Fermi ball become stable.\nThe purpose of the present paper is to examine how the fermion content of the model\naffects the stability of the Fermi ball. As an example, we consider an extended model in\nwhich fermions with multi-flavors are coupled to a scalar field through Yukawa coupling.\nSince the Pauli's exclusion principle does not apply to the different flavors of the fermions,\nthe stable region of the parameters is expected to broaden.\n\nII.\n\nSTABILITY OF FERMI BALL\n\nWe consider the following Lagrangian density,\nn\nX\n1\n\u03a8i (i\u03b3i\u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u2212 Gi \u03c6)\u03a8i \u2212 U(\u03c6) ,\nL = (\u2202\u03bc \u03c6)2 +\n2\ni=1\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the scalar potential U(\u03c6) is given by\nU(\u03c6) =\n\n\u03bb 2\n(\u03c6 \u2212 v 2 )2 + \u2206(\u03c6) .\n8\n\n(2)\n\nIf the quantity |\u2206(v) \u2212 \u2206(\u2212v)| is zero, the Lagrangian density is invariant under the Z2\ntransformation, \u03c6 \u2194 \u2212\u03c6.

Let \u03a8i be\n2\nthe eigenfunction of the total angular momentum squared ~J , the z component Jz and the\nparity P with the eigenvalues of J(J + 1), M and (\u22121)J\u2212\u03c9/2 (\u03c9 = \u00b11), respectively.

Since the Fermi ball is a ground state with a fixed\n\nNi =\n\nZ\n\nd3 x \u03a8\u2020i \u03a8i ,\n\n(6)\n\nwe obtain the wave function \u03c8i and the scalar field \u03c6 by extremizing\nL\u01eb [\u03c6, \u03c8i ] = L[\u03c6, \u03c8i ] +\n\nX\n\n\u01ebi\n\ni\n\nXZ\n\nKM\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\ndr\n\n\u03c8i\u2020 \u03c8i\n\n\u2212 Ni\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(7)\n\nwith the Lagrange multipliers \u01ebi .

Under these\nassumptions, the coefficient C is independent of N and dependent on \u03bb, G and n from\nEq.(32). We evaluate Eq.(32) using a numerical integration, and obtain the stable region of\nthe parameters where C is positive (see Figures 1 and 2).

We see that the allowed regions broaden as n increases.\nIII.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have considered a model for the Fermi ball in which the fermions with multi-flavors\n\u03a8i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) are coupled to the scalar field \u03c6 and the total fermion number of each i-th\nflavor is fixed as Ni . We have examined the region of the parameters for the Fermi ball to\nbe stable against fragmentation, and how the number of the fermion flavors n affects the\nstability.\nWe have considered the thin-wall Fermi ball, i.e., the radius R is much larger than the\nwall thickness \u03b4b . We have taken into account the effect due to the finite wall thickness by the\nperturbation expansion with respect to \u03b4b /R. In the leading order thin-wall approximation,\nwe have compared the energy of the initial state of a single Fermi ball and that of the\nfinal state of fragmented m Fermi balls, with the total fermion number Ni of each flavor\n9\n\n\fi being conserved,\n\nPm\n\na=1\n\n(a)\n\nNi\n\n= Ni . We have found that the former is smaller than the\n\nlatter and thus the Fermi ball is stable against fragmentation, except for the special case\n(a)\n\nof Ni\n\n= c(a) Ni with\n\nPm\n\na=1\n\nc(a) = 1. This situation that the Fermi ball is stable in most\n\ncases is characteristic of the case with multi-flavor of fermions, and qualitatively different\n(a)\n\nfrom the case of a single flavor. In the special case of Ni\n\n= c(a) Ni , the two states have the\n\nsame energy in the leading order approximation and the next-to-leading order correction\nterm \u03b4E determines the stability. There we have found that the energy of the initial state\nis E0 + Cv and that of the fragmented states is E0 + mCv, where v is a symmetry breaking\nscale and C is a coefficient dependent on the scalar self-coupling constant \u03bb, the Yukawa\ncoupling constant Gi and the fermion number Ni . This tells us that even in that case the\nFermi ball is stable when C takes a positive value in the parameter region of \u03bb, Gi and Ni .\nWe have considered the simplified model in which a multiplet of fermions has a common\nGi and a common Ni for each flavor i. We have found that the allowed region of the\nparameters for the Fermi ball to be stable exists and broadens as the multiplet dimension n\nincreases.\n\n[1] A. L. Macpherson and B. A. Campbell, Phys.
