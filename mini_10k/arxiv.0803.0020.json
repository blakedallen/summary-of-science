B. Lesovik\nInstitute of Solid State Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences, 142432 Chernogolovka,\nMoscow Region, Russia\n\nR. Loosen\nBayer AG, 51368 Leverkusen, Germany\n\n10 February 1997\nWe consider a measurement of finite-frequency current fluctuations,\nusing a resonance circuit as a model for the detector. We arrive at an\nexpression for the measurable response in terms of the current\u2013current\ncorrelators which differs from the standard ~symmetrized! formula. The\npossibility of detection of vacuum fluctuations is discussed.\nPACS numbers: 05.40.1j, 07.50.Hp, 72.70.1m\n\nFinite-frequency ~FF! current fluctuations at zero temperature ~vacuum fluctuations,\nVFs! have been discussed for a long time1 in connection with the analogous question of\nelectromagnetic vacuum fluctuations. Recently there has been renewed interest in the\nnoise at finite frequency in connection with the supposed possibility of observing the\nFermi edge singularity in noninteracting1,2 and interacting3 systems.\nIn the present letter we consider a realistic model for an FF measurement and show\nthat, in a very close analogy with the electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations, a certain\nmeasurability limitation appears.\nThere are different practical and theoretical approaches to FF measurements:\n1. Making repeated measurements of the instantaneous values of the current over a\nlong time interval and later Fourier transforming the data obtained.\n2. Making a single measurement of the charge transmitted during a given time\ninterval. In that case the information about the FF fluctuation appears through an integral\nover all frequencies. Ideally that can be done by making two measurements of the charge\nin the reservoir, the initial ~during system preparation! and final. An alternative measurement can be made with a ''Larmor clock'' ~the spin rotating in the magnetic field produced by the current!; this method, which is described in Ref. 4, can perhaps be implemented.\n3. Making a time-averaged measurement of the response of a resonance circuit,\nwhich can be an ordinary LC element, i.e., an inductive element coupled to the quantum\nwire, a capacitor whose charge is the quantity to be measured as a response, and the\nresistance of the circuit.\nThe last approach, we believe, is the most relevant for FF measurements.\nWe model our detector ~the resonator, which we will refer to as LC) by an oscillator\n1\n\n\fand consider the response in the first nonvanishing order in the inductive coupling constant ~we will outline the calculation at the end!.\nFinally, we arrive at the practical conclusion that the measurable response of such a\nmodel detector at a certain frequency V can be written in terms of the usual current\u2013\ncurrent correlators as follows:\nS meas5K $ S 1 ~ V ! 1N V @ S 1 ~ V ! 2S 2 ~ V !# % ,\n\n~1!\n\nwith the definitions\nS 1~ V ! 5\n\nE\n\ndt ^ I ~ 0 ! I ~ t ! & exp~ iVt ! ,\n\nS 2~ V ! 5\n\nE\n\ndt ^ I ~ t ! I ~ 0 ! & exp~ iVt ! .\n\nand\n\nThe frequency V in all the expressions is strictly positive. N V stands for the Bose\noccupation number of the oscillator, i.e., N V 5 @ exp(\\V/kBTLC)21#21, K is the effective\ncoupling constant of the quantum wire with the resonator, ^ A & 5Trr A, where r is the\ndensity matrix of the electrons, and the time-dependent current operators are defined in\nthe standard way: I(t)5exp(iHt)I exp(2iHt).\nThe expression obtained here should be contrasted with the widely used formula5\nS~ v !5\n\nE\n\ndt exp ~ i v t !\n\nK\n\nL\n\n1\n$ I ~ 0 ! I ~ t ! 1I ~ t ! I ~ 0 ! % .\n2\n\n~2!\n\nNote that this formula contains the symmetrized current\u2013current correlator. The necessity\nof such a symmetrization comes from the fact that in the general case the current operators at different times do not commute with each other, and it is motivated by the close\ncorrespondence with the classical expression.5\nUsing the definition ~2!, one arrives at the well-known expression for the spectral\ndensity of the current\u2013current correlator for a conductor in equilibrium:6\nS ~ v ! 52G\\V\n\nF\n\nG\n\n1\n1\n1\n.\n2 exp~ \\V/k B T ! 21\n\n~3!\n\nThis expression tells us that at zero temperature one should expect fluctuations\nproportional to the frequency, which are interpreted as an analog of the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field.\nNevertheless, as is known from optical measurements, ordinary photodetectors do\nnot react to the vacuum fluctuations, because it is not possible to take energy from the\nvacuum to excite atoms in the detector.7\nYet the vacuum fluctuations are observable, though less directly than are ordinary\nfluctuations, via the Lamb shift8 or the Casimir effect9 or by using a so-called quantum\nphotocounter,10 which is prepared in an excited state and can thus react to VFs.\n2\n\n\fAs we will now show by analyzing Eq. ~1!, an LC detector may operate as a\nphotodetector without any reaction to VFs or as an optical detector for VFs, but it never\ngives the standard Nyquist expression for FF noise ~3!, as one might naively expect.\nIf the detected frequency is higher than the LC temperature, the occupation N V is\nexponentially small, and the only nonvanishing term in ~1! is the ''positive part'' of the\nspectral density S 1 (V), which describes the ''emission'' of energy by the conductor to\nthe LC circuit, and in that case the LC circuit functions as an ordinary photodetector.\nAs an example, for S 1 (V) in a coherent conductor with transmission D at zero\ntemperature and a finite bias voltage one has\nS 1~ V ! 5\n\n2e 2\nD ~ 12D !~ eV2\\V !\nh\n\n~4!\n\nif \\V,eV and S 1 (V)50 otherwise.\nWe have neglected the energy dependence of the transmission in the expression\nabove, as well as an additional frequency dependence which has to come from the\naveraging over the coordinates ~see below!. Equation ~4! coincides with the excess spectral density calculated in Ref. 1 using the symmetrized correlator ~2!.\nIf the frequency is much lower than the detector temperature, \\V!k B T LC , one may\nreplace the Bose occupation number N V by k B T LC /\\V.\nThe difference S 1 (V)2S 2 (V) is negative, and in the case of a quantum conductor,\nprovided that the transmissions D n depend only weakly on the energy we find\nS 1 2S 2 522\\VG,\n\n~5!\n\nwhere G52e 2 /h ( n D n is the conductance.11\nNote that the singular behavior of the spectral density at \\V5eV which was found\nin Ref. 2 for the symmetrized expression S 1 1S 2 is not present in S 1 2S 2 , and we\nconclude that the measurable singularity at zero temperature and finite bias is due solely\nto the cutoff of the frequency by the voltage in S 1 (V) ~4!.\nAltogether, for \\V!k B T LC we have\nS meas5K $ S 1 ~ V ! 22Gk B T LC % .\n\n~6!\n\nThe meaning of the negative part is clear-the LC circuit is ''cooled down'' by\nemitting energy into the conductor. So, in some sense, in this limit the vacuum fluctuations, represented by S 2 , are detectable; note, however, that they appear in the answer in\na way which is quite different from the Nyquist expression ~3!.\nIf the conductor is in equilibrium ~aside from the weak interaction with the LC\ncircuit!, for low frequencies we find\nS meas}2G ~ T e 2T LC ! .\n\n~7!\n\nThis expression vanishes if the electron temperature T e is equal to the LC temperature T LC , as is expected for overall equilibrium.\nAt intermediate frequencies, where k B T e ,eV bias!\\V!k B T LC the measurable response is negative:\n3\n\n\fS meas522Gk B T LC .\n\n~8!\n\nLet us now outline briefly the derivation of Eq. ~1!. Our chosen detector can be\nregarded as a harmonic oscillator coupled linearly to the time derivative of the current to\nbe measured:\nM \u1e8d ~ t ! 52Dx ~ t ! 2 a \u0130 ~ t ! .\n\n~9!\n\nIn terms of the physical parameters of the counter ~inductance L, inductive coupling,\nand capacitance C), we may write: M 5L, D51/C, resonance frequency\nV5 AD/M 5 A1/LC, while a is the inductive coupling itself.\nOur goal is to calculate the change in x 2 due to current fluctuations in the first\nnonvanishing order of perturbation theory.\nWe must evaluate the expression:\n\n^ x 2 ~ 0 ! & 5 ~ 2i a ! 2\n\nE E\n0\n\n2`\n\ndt 1\n\nt1\n\n2`\n\ndt 2 e h ~ t 1 1t 2 ! ^ @@ x 2 ~ 0 ! ,x ~ t 1 ! \u0130 ~ t 1 !# ,x ~ t 2 ! \u0130 ~ t 2 !## & . ~10!\n\nThe angle brackets here stand for averaging over the unperturbed density matrix of\nthe electrons and the oscillator. Evaluating the expression above, we get\n\n^ x 2~ 0 ! & 5\n\nS DE\na\n2M V\n\n2\n\n1`\n\n2`\n\ndt exp~ 2 h u t u 1iVt !\n\nF\n\n1\n\nh\n\n2\n\n1\n\nh 2i sign~ t !

If we neglect that problem and replace the Lorenzian by\na delta function, h / h 2 1( v 2V) 2 5 p d ( v 2V), we end up with Eq. ~1! with the coefficient K in it given by\nK5\n\nS D\na\n2L\n\n2\n\n1\n.\n2h\n\n~12!\n\nThe coefficient diverges as the width of the resonance h goes to zero, so we keep the\nlatter small but finite.\nThe shape F( v 2V) of the resonance in the LC circuit, when calculated more\nexactly, is in fact not a Lorenzian, and without specifying it we may write instead of Eq.\n~1!\nS meas5\n\nE\n\ndv\nF ~ v 2V ! $ S 1 ~ v ! 1N V @ S 1 ~ v ! 2S 2 ~ v !# % .\n2p\n\n~13!\n\nThe function F(D v ) can in principle be measured independently, by applying an alternating current. Afterwards the measured expression can be substituted into the formula\nabove.\n4\n\n\fIn general the current operator and its average over the density-matrix correlators at\ndifferent times depends on the coordinates. The operators I(t) used in this paper are in\nfact the total current operators averaged, in addition, over the length l of the inductivecoupling region,\nI ~ t ! [1/l\n\nE\n\nX1l/2\n\nX2l/2\n\nI ~ r,t ! dr.\n\nBecause of this symmetry with respect to the coordinates, the current operators stand\nas I(r 1 ,t)1I(r 2 ,t), although we keep a certain order in time.\nApart from the symmetrization with respect to the coordinates, the problem of the\nordering of the current operators stems from the presence of the vacuum fluctuation part.\nIf discussion is limited to the low-frequency limit \\V!eV bias ,k B T, then it does not\nmatter whether one uses S 1 (V), S 2 (V), or the Fourier-transformed symmetrized equation ~2!, the result will be the same up to small corrections of the order of\n\\V/eV, k B T.\nWe are indebted to Janosh Hajdu for many helpful discussions and for his participation in the initial stages of this work.
