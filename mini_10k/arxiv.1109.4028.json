INTRODUCTION\n\nThe radio-loud AGNs are powerful objects in which\nstrong radio emission originate from non-thermal processes associated with the bipolar outflow from central active nuclei. In the observation of low radio frequency, they mainly consist of the radio galaxies (RGs)\nand steep-spectrum radio quasars (SSRQs), such as GHz\nPeaked Spectrum sources (GPSs), Compact Steep Spectrum sources (CSSs), Giant Radio Galaxies (GRGs) etc.\nSome radio galaxies have linear sizes as large as several megaparsecs, and are possibly the largest individual objects in the Universe (Lara et al. 2004). The radio\nstructures of radio-loud AGNs often show various morphologies, but a two-component structure with core and\nlobes (generally showing a steep-spectrum) is usually in\ncommon. Traditionally, the 'core' is defined as a component which is normally unresolved on arcsecond scales\nand has a flat spectrum. It is usually believed that the\ncore is coincident with the active nucleus that transports energy and matter to the extended lobes by the\noutflow. Feretti et al. (1984) found a statistically significant correlation between the core radio power at 5.0\nGHz and the total radio power at 408 MHz which is\nmainly dominated by extended lobes. Similar relations\nwere also found by other authors (e.g. Giovannini et al.\n1988; Zirbel & Baum 1995). In recent years, Hardcastle and his collaborators have found more relations between the properties of cores and extended lobes based on\n3CRR radio galaxies/QSOs (see Hardcastle et al. 1998;\nMullin et al. 2008; Hardcastle et al. 2009). It is known\nthat the luminosity of radio galaxies/QSOs evolve with\ntime (Singal 1993; Blundell et al. 1999). As the most active parts in radio AGNs, it is not known whether the\nyuanzunli@ynao.ac.cn\n1 National Astronomical Observatories, Yunnan Observatory,\nChinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming 650011, China\n2 Key Laboratory for the Structure and Evolution of Celestial\nObjects, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming 650011, China\n3 Graduate School, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, P.R.\nChina\n\ncores co-evolve with their parent radio sources. To investigate this problem, we study their radio luminosity\nfunctions (i.e., core and total RLF respectively).\nThe RLF, presenting the space density of radio sources\nalong with redshift and luminosity, is very important because its shape and evolution provide constraints on the\nnature of radio activity and the cosmic evolution of radio\ngalaxies/QSOs (Willott et al. 2001). Many researches on\nthe total RLF have been done (e.g. Colla et al. 1975;\nDunlop & Peacock 1990; Willott et al. 1998; Jarvis et al.\n2001; Gendre et al. 2010) since Longair (1966) performed\nsome precursory work. Dunlop & Peacock (1990) found\na decline of the RLF beyond z \u223c 2.5, e.g. so-called redshift cut-off. Colla et al. (1975) calculated the RLF of\ncores based on a sample of 54 bright elliptical galaxies\nidentified with radio sources of the B2 catalogue. However, they did not present any evolution of radio cores\nwith redshift. After then, the research on the RLF of\nthe cores is rare. Because the cores are often unresolved\nand variable, it is not easy to establish a desirable sample of cores with reliable radio flux. In recent years, the\nfluxes of cores in many sources were obtained by Very\nLarge Array (VLA), Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), Parkes-Tidbinbilla real-time interferometer\n(PTI), and Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI).\nIn this paper, we establish a large combined sample of\nradio galaxies/QSOs by collecting data from the literature. Many sources have 5 GHz core flux (57.1%), total\nflux at 408 MHz (100%) and redshifts (97.0%). We then\nderive the core RLF at 5 GHz and total RLF at 408 MHz\nrespectively, and compare their properties to study the\nco-evolution in detail.\nThe sources in our sample are all steep-spectrum\nones which mainly consist of radio galaxies and steepspectrum QSOs. The flat-spectrum counterparts of these\nsources are flat-spectrum QSOs and BL Lacs. In the\nlight of Unified Scheme of AGNs (e.g. Antonucci 1993;\nUrry & Padovani 1995), the steep-spectrum sources are\ninclined at larger angles to the observer. This 'edge-on'\n\n\fYuan & Wang\n\ncharacter make it possible to observe the extended lobes\nand radio cores at the same time. In addition, the radio cores in steep-spectrum sources are less affected by\nDoppler-boosting compared with that in flat-spectrum\nsources. Therefore we use steep-spectrum sources to\nstudy the evolution relationship between the cores and\ntheir extended radio emission.\nThroughout the paper, we adopt a Lambda Cold Dark\nMatter cosmology with the parameters \u03a9m = 0.27, \u03a9\u039b\n= 0.73, and H0 = 71 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 .\n\n26\n\n24\n\n22\n\nR-mag\n\n2\n\n20\n\n18\n\n2. THE COMBINED SAMPLE\n\n2.1. The 3CRR bright sample\nThe 3CRR bright sample, also known as LRL sample\n(Laing et al. 1983), is a sample of 173 sources at 178\nMHz with flux-density above 10.9 Jy, over a 4.233 sr\nregion of the sky. Assuming a typical index of 0.8, we\nobtain the flux limit to be 5.6 Jy at 408 MHz. Following\nWillott et al. (2001), we exclude three sources, 3C231,\n3C345, 3C454.3, in which 3C231 (M82) is a starburst\ngalaxy, while 3C345 and 3C454.3 actually have fluxes\nlower than the flux limit. This sample thus includes 170\nsources, in which 169 sources have core flux densities at\n5 GHz and all sources have spectroscopic redshifts.\n2.2. The MRC 1-Jy sample\nThe MRC 1-Jy sample was selected by McCarthy\nand his collaborators from the Molonglo Reference Catalog (MRC Large et al. 1981, 1991) at 408 MHz (see\nMcCarthy et al. 1996, for details). The sample consists of 559 radio sources, in which 111 ones are quasars\n(Kapahi et al. 1998a) and others are radio galaxies\n(Kapahi et al. 1998b). The flux limit is 0.95 Jy at 408\nMHz and the sky area covered is 0.56 sr. 18 sources\nare excluded because they are flat-spectrum ones with\nspectral index near 408 MHz \u03b1 < 0.5 (S = \u03bd \u2212\u03b1 ). For\nthe left 541 sources, core flux densities of 207 objects\nwere retrieved from the literature. Only 375 (69.3%)\nsources have spectroscopic redshift data. Since the main\nsources without redshifts are radio galaxies, we estimate\ntheir photometric redshifts using the empirical relation\nof R \u2212 z or K \u2212 z derived from extended sources in the\nMRC 1-Jy sample with galaxy identifications. The Rband magnitude data are from McCarthy et al. (1996)\nand K-band data are from P. J. McCarthy (by private\ncommunication). The two relations are shown in Fig. 1\n\n16\n\n14\n-1.5\n\n-1.0\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\nlog(z)\n\nFig. 1.- R-z relation from MRC 1-Jy data (McCarthy et al.\n1996) for extended sources.

A set of\nindependent complete samples in different surveys with\ndifferent flux limit can also be combined together into\none 'coherent' sample (Avni & Bahcall 1980). In the\npaper we construct such a coherent sample combined\nwith four independent complete samples (described below) totalling 1063 sources. These samples are selected\nfrom low-frequency survey, e.g. one sample at 178 MHz\nand three at 408 MHz. They have smaller orientation bias (Hardcastle et al. 1998) than high-frequency selected samples. The following sections present detailed\ninformation about the sub-samples. The final list of radio galaxies/QSOs can be found in the Appendix A.\n\n16\n\n14\n\n12\n\n-1.5\n\n-1.0\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\nlog(z)\n\nFig. 2.- K-z relation for extended sources of MRC 1-Jy.

Photometric redshifts\nof 138 sources are estimated, bringing the total number\nof sources with redshift information to 513 (94.8%).\n2.3. The MS4 sample\nThe Molonglo Southern 4 Jy sample (hereafter MS4)\nwas selected by Burgess & Hunstead (2006a,b) from the\nMRC at 408 MHz. Located in a different region of the\n\n\fOn the Evolution of the Cores and Lobes\nsky with the MRC 1-Jy sample, MS4 has a flux limit\nof 4.0 Jy at 408 MHz and covers a sky area of 2.43 sr.\nAfter excluding 10 flat-spectrum sources, there are 218\nones left, in which 213 have spectroscopic redshifts. The\ncore fluxes of 160 sources at 5 GHz are retrieved from\nthe literature.\n\n2.5. The ratio of core to extended radio fluxes\nAlthough all the 1063 sources in our combined sample are steep-spectrum, this can not guarantee that the\nDoppler boosting effects are negligible. In order to estimate these effects on RLF calculation, we have evaluated\nthe ratio of core to extended radio fluxes for our sample.\nIn the literature, this ratio is often referred to as the\nRc -parameter (Zirbel & Baum 1995), or as the orientation parameter (Padovani & Urry 1992). We calculate\nthe ratio via:\nRc =\n\nScore(5GHz)\nStotal(5GHz) \u2212 Score(5GHz)\n\n(3)\n\nThe total fluxes at 5 GHz for most of the sources are\nretrieved from the literature. For few sources in which\nno Stotal(5GHz) is available, we convert the flux of nearest frequency. In Fig. 3 we show the histograms of the\nRc -parameters for our sample. Padovani & Urry (1992)\nshowed that steep-spectrum quasars have their radio axes\nwithin 14\u25e6 . \u03b8 . 40\u25e6 , and high-luminosity RGs are in\nthe range \u03b8 & 40\u25e6 . They associated the Rc -parameter\nwith \u03b8, i.e., the larger Rc corresponds to smaller view\nangle \u03b8. It is shown in Fig. 3 that 94% sources have\nlog Rc < 0, and 70% sources with log Rc < \u22121. This implies that only few sources (\u223c 5%) have viewing angles\ntypically smaller 40\u25e6 . We thus argue that the Doppler\nboosting effects are not important for RLF calculation.\n3. THE RADIO LUMINOSITY FUNCTION\n\nThe RLF \u03c1(L, z) is defined as the number density of\nradio sources per unit comoving volume per unit logarithmic luminosity. The luminosity used here is restframe monochromatic luminosity (W/Hz). We chose to\nevaluate the total radio luminosity at 408 MHz to minimize the potential impact of beaming, and also because\nit is the frequency of the MRC samples. For the 3CRR\nsources, the fluxes at 408 MHz are taken from literature\nor converted from the fluxes at 178 MHz. The core radio\nluminosity is evaluated at 5 GHz, and is less contaminated by the lobe radiation.\nThere are many methods to determine the RLF. The\nmaximum likelihood (Marshall et al. 1983) and binned\n1/Va methods (Avni & Bahcall 1980) are commonly\nused. In this paper, we use the 1/Va method to calculate\nthe total and core RLFs.\n\n100\n\nQSOs\nRGs\n80\n\nNumber\n\n2.4. The BRL sample\nThis sample, selected by Best et al. (1999), was also\nfrom the MRC at 408 MHz. It locates in different sky\nfrom the MS4 sample and partly overlaps with the MRC\n1-Jy sample. The flux limit of BRL is 5.0 Jy at 408\nMHz and the sky area is 3.606 sr. The sample contains\n178 sources with spectroscopic redshifts. Removing the\nsources repeated in MRC 1-Jy sample, as well as 9 flatspectrum ones, we finally obtain 134 sources in the sample, in which 65 objects have the core fluxes at 5 GHz.\n\n3\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\nlog\n\n10\n\nR\n\n0\n\n1\n\nc\n\nFig. 3.- The distribution of Rc -parameter for our sample.

The binned 1/Va methods\nThe binned 1/Va method, a generalized version of the\noriginal 1/Vmax method (Schmidt 1968), is often used\nto estimate the luminosity function (LF) of combined\ncomplete samples. The method of estimating the LF\nevolution with the redshift was developed by (Eales 1993;\nEllis et al. 1996).\nThe RLF in the ranges [z1 , z2 ] and [log10 L1 , log10 L2 ]\nis estimated as\n\u03c1(L, z) = (\u2206 log10 L)\u22121\n\nN\nX\n1\ni\nV\ni=1 a\n\n(4)\n\nand the error on each bin (Marshall 1985) is given by\n\u03c3 = (\u2206 log10 L)\u22121 [\n\nN\nX\n\n(Vai )\u22122 ]0.5 .\n\n(5)\n\ni=1\n\nVai is the total accessible volume of radio source i given\nby\nij\nZ zmax\nM\nX\ndV\ni\nVij = Cj \u03a9j\nVa =\ndz,\n(6)\nij\nzmin dz\nj=1\nwhere Vij is the accessible volume of the radio source i\nin sub-sample j. \u03a9j is the solid angle subtended by subsample j and Cj is a modified factor of sample completeij\nij\nness. zmin\nand zmax\nare the minimum and maximum\nredshifts defined as (Eales 1993)\nij\nzmin\n= max[z1 , z(Li , S1j )],\n\n(7)\n\nij\nzmax\n= min[z2 , z(Li , S2j )]\n\n(8)\n\nand\nwhere S1j and S2j are the minimum and maximum fluxes\nof sub-sample j respectively. z(L, S) is the redshift of\nobject with luminosity L and flux S.

The total RLF at 408 MHz\nBy choosing seven redshift bins (indicated in the lowerleft part of panel in Fig.4) and the luminosity bins of\nwidth \u2206 log10 L408 = 0.3, the binned total RLF at 408\nMHz is obtained and shown in Fig.4.\nThe binned RLF can be approximately described by\nbroken power-law, although the case of redshift bin\n0 < z < 0.15 is a little special. Similar to luminosity functions at other wavebands (see Boyle et al. 2000;\nMiyaji et al. 2000), the RLF is steeper at the bright end\nand flatter at the faint end. This shape is rather remarkable at high redshift.\nThe low-luminosity (composed of FRIs and lowexcitation/weak emission line FRIIs) and the highluminosity sources are believed to have different evolution (Dunlop & Peacock 1990; Willott et al. 2001). The\nfaintest sub-sample of our combined sample is the MRC\n1-Jy sample with a flux limit of 0.95 Jy. We find that\nthis sample is still too small to decide the evolution\ntrends of low-luminosity sources. Especially at high redshift, the RLFs spread in a very narrow luminosity range,\nwhile at the lowest redshift bin 0 < z < 0.15, the RLF\nshows a obvious two-population composition. The main\nreason is that the FR I sources are dominant at very\nlow luminosity (\u223c log10 (L408 /WHz\u22121 ) < 25), which is\nan approximate dichotomy luminosity of FR Is and FR\nIIs (Fanaroff & Riley 1974)). The RLF at redshift bin\n0 < z < 0.15 thus represents a combination of two populations. More detailed discussion on this problem will be\nthe subject of our future work which deals with analytical\ndescription of the RLFs.\n3.2.1. Sources without spectroscopic redshifts\nIn our combined sample, 171 sources have no spectroscopic redshifts. As shown in section 2.2, photometric\nredshifts of 138 sources are estimated, leaving still 33\nsources without redshifts. The number distribution for\nthe seven redshift bins (indicated in the lower-left part of\npanel in Fig.4) is shown in Fig.5. It can be noticed that\nthe sources with estimated redshifts are mainly located in\nthe three highest redshift bins. For the 33 sources without redshifts, which are mainly radio galaxies from the\nMRC 1-Jy sample, we assume that they have the same\nredshift distribution as the 138 estimated ones. Owing\nto intrinsic scatters (see Fig.1 and Fig.2) in the empirical\nrelation of R \u2212 z and K \u2212 z, more or less error will be\nintroduced into the total RLFs. Especially for the last\ntwo redshift bins (1.5 < z < 2.2 and 2.2 < z < 3.5), the\npercentage of sources with estimated redshifts are fairly\nhigh (\u223c 30% and 50%). Taking into account the intrinsic scatters in the two relations, the mean square error\nof redshift estimation is 0.4427. The error introduced\ninto the RLFs for the last two redshift bins is grossly estimated as 0.4 order of magnitude, roughly comparable\nwith the error given by Eq.(5).\n3.2.2. The redshift cut-off\n\nBased on our sample, we also study the 'redshift\ncut-off' question, involving whether the comoving number density of radio AGNs declines dramatically at\nthe redshift beyond z \u223c 2.5. The RLFs of flatspectrum radio sources support the existence of a redshift cut-off (e.g. Dunlop & Peacock 1990; Shaver et al.\n1996; Jarvis & Rawlings 2000; Wall et al. 2005), while\nthe 'redshift cut-off' in the steep-spectrum radio sources\nhas much controversy. Dunlop & Peacock (1990) firstly\nproposed a 'redshift cut-off' for steep-spectrum radio sources, while several authors (Jarvis et al. 2001;\nCruz et al. 2007) subsequently refuted this conclusion.\nThe RLF we obtained doses not show an obvious 'redshift cut-off' over the whole luminosity range. However,\nas shown in above, the bias introduced by the 33 sources\nwithout redshifts and 138 ones with only estimated redshifts can not be excluded for the last two redshift bins.\nConsidering these effects, the 'redshift cut-off' is still not\nobvious in our RLFs.\n3.2.3. The luminosity-dependent evolution\nThe faint end of the RLF begins to flatten at z \u223c 1.25,\nimplying that the positive density evolution of fainter\nsources slows down beyond z \u223c 1.25. From the binning RLF at 2.7 GHz, Waddington et al. (2001) concluded that the comoving density of these sources begins\nto decline at 1 . z . 2, while the actual turnover redshift may depend on the radio luminosity, implying the\nevolution to be a function of the intrinsic power. Our\nresults thus support the luminosity-dependent evolution\nand agree with other previous researches (Vigotti et al.\n2003; Cirasuolo et al. 2005). In fact, the luminositydependent evolution is also confirmed by optical and Xray selected AGNs (Hasinger et al. 2005; de Zotti et al.\n2010).\n3.3. The core-total power correlation\nThe total versus core radio luminosity for our sample of\nradio sources is plotted in Fig.6. In agrement with previous results (e.g. Zirbel & Baum 1995; Lara et al. 2004),\nwe also find a strong correlation for radio galaxies (RGs)\nand a weaker correlation for QSOs. The relations are\nlog10 Ltotal = log10 Lcore \u00d7 (0.83 \u00b1 0.04) + (7.10 \u00b1 0.90)\nfor RGs and log10 Ltotal = log10 Lcore \u00d7 (0.39 \u00b1 0.04) +\n(18.00 \u00b1 1.15) for QSOs. The RGs have a steeper slope\nthan QSOs, indicating that their total power increases\nmore rapidly with core power. RGs span a wider region\nin the total power, while QSOs are mainly distributed in\nthe bright region.\n3.4. The core RLF at 5.0 GHz\nAs the most active parts of radio AGNs, the cores are\ncompact and bright. There are no surveys to search radio cores exclusively. The core fluxes are often derived\nby high-resolution observation after their parent radio\nsources have been identified. Our samples of cores thus\ndo not have a flux limit as their parent radio samples\ndo. Seeing that the 3CRR sample is almost complete\n(99.4%) for core flux densities, it is used separately to\nestimate the binned core RLF by the method introduced\nin section 3.1. The relevant minimum core flux density\nis used as flux limit.\nChoosing six redshift bins (shown in the upper-right\npart of panel in Fig.7) and luminosity bins of width\n\n\fOn the Evolution of the Cores and Lobes\n\n5\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n/ Mpc\n\n-3\n\n( log\n\n10\n\nL\n\n408\n\n)\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n0.0<z<0.15\n\n-7\n\n10\n\n0.15<z<0.4\n-8\n\n10\n\n0.40<z<0.7\n0.70<z<1.0\n\n-9\n\n10\n\n1.0<z<1.50\n1.50<z<2.2\n\n-10\n\n10\n\n2.20<z<3.5\n-11\n\n10\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\nlog\n\n10\n\n26\n(L\n\n27\n\n28\n\n29\n\n-1\n\n408\n\n/ W Hz )\n\nFig. 4.- The binned total RLFs are plotted with Poisson errors from Eq.(5).

It is notable that the faint end of RLFs begin to flatten visibly at redshift of z \u223c 1.25.

Comparing core RLF with total RLF\nIn order to compare the core RLF from the 3CRR sample and the total RLF in more detail, both RLFs are\nplotted together for all the redshift bins in Fig.9. The\nshapes of core and total RLFs are obviously different,\nimplying the different evolution of their radio emission.\nBecause the radio sources in our combined sample are all\n\n4. DISCUSSION\n\nThe main result of this paper is the strikingly different\nevolution of the 'cores' of radio sources compared to their\nextended radio emission. It is already known that the\nnumber density of extragalactic radio sources with both\nsteep-spectrum and flat-spectrum increase sharply from\nz = 0 to z = 2 (e.g. Wall et al. 2005), while our study appears to show negative evolution for the number density\nof radio cores. Especially for the flat-spectrum sources,\nthey are believed to be dominated by cores. We argue\nthat although the flat-spectrum sources are dominated\nby cores, they can not be regarded as pure cores after\nall. Furthermore, in the light of unified models of AGNs,\nthe flat-spectrum sources have a jet oriented at a small\nangle with respect to the line of sight, and their radio\ncore luminosity are boosted by jet beaming effect. This\nmake the RLF of flat-spectrum sources more obscure.\nThus we have no reason to believe that their evolution\nof number density must be in agreement with the radio\ncores.\n4.1. The radio cores\nThe striking evolution of the radio cores induce us to\nreexamine what a radio core is. Thus a brief review\nof the radio cores is worthwhile. In the standard interpretation, the core is taken to be the optically thick\nbase of the jet (Blandford & Konigl 1979). This has\nbeen proved to be indeed the case as shown by VLBI\nmaps (Antonucci 2011). As Falcke & Biermann (1995)\nmodeled, after the jet formed, the flow will be firstly\naccelerated in a nozzle close to the disk, then it will\nexpand adiabatically, enclosing the magnetic field and\nshowing up as the compact core. The radio core emission, which is generally thought to be self-absorbed nonthermal synchrotron emission originate in the inner jet\n(Verdoes Kleijn et al. 2002), has a high degree of polarization, a high brightness temperature (Ho 2008), and\ntypically a flat spectral slope at radio wavelengths. Due\nto synchrotron self-absorption, the absolute position of\nthe observed VLBI core shifts systematically with frequency, moving increasingly outward along the VLBI jet\nwith lower frequency (Kudryavtseva et al. 2011).\n4.2. The negative evolution of radio cores\nAs shown in Fig.7 and Fig.8, the comoving number\ndensity of radio cores presents a persistent decline with\nredshift, implying a negative density evolution. It seems\nthat the core radio emission could be gradually powered by central engines with cosmic epoch, or the radioloudness of the cores be epoch-dependent. Specifically,\nthe radio loudness of the cores may be weaker in earlier\nepoch, and fewer cores can be observed in radio emission.\nIndeed, amongst the galaxies harbouring an AGN, only\na small fraction (about 10%) appear to be luminous at\nradio wavelengths (de Zotti et al. 2010), and there have\nbeen suggestions that the radio loudness may be epochdependent (also see Saikia & Jamrozy 2009).\nHo (2002) and Sikora et al. (2007) found that there is\na strong correlation between radio loudness and Eddington ratio (Lbol /LEdd , the ratio of bolometric luminosity\n\n\fOn the Evolution of the Cores and Lobes\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n0<z<0.15\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n0.15<z<0.4\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n-7\n\n10\n\n10\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n22\n\n27\n\n-9\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n-10\n\n28\n\n23\n\n0.7<z<1.0\n\n10\n\n1.0<z<1.5\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n29\n\n10\n\n-9\n\n10\n\n-10\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n29\n\n30\n\n-9\n\n-10\n\n-10\n\n10\n24\n\n1.5<z<2.2\n\n-9\n\n10\n\n10\n\n25\n\n-8\n\n-8\n\n10\n\n10\n\n24\n\n-7\n\n-3\n\n/ Mpc\n\n-8\n\n-9\n\n(\n\nlog\n\n19\n\n10\n\n0.4<z<0.7\n\n-8\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-7\n\n-4\n\n10\n\nL\n\n408 / 5.0\n\n)\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n7\n\n24\n\n25\n\nlog\n\n10\n\n26\n\n(L\n\n27\n\n28\n\n29\n\n-11\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n29\n\n-1\n\n5.0 / 408\n\n/ W Hz )\n\nFig. 9.- Comparison of core-total RLF for each redshift bin.

Due to the different frequency of core RLF and total RLF (5 GHz and 408 MHz respectively), the term L5.0/408\nis used.\n\nto Eddington luminosity), indicating that radio loudness\ndecreases with increasing Lbol /LEdd . Both studies used\nthe R parameter, defined as the ratio of the monochromatic 5 GHz radio luminosity to the 4400 \u00c5 optical\nluminosity (R \u2261 L\u03bd5 /L\u03bdB ), to characterize the degree\nof radio loudness. Sikora et al. (2007) used the total\nluminosity (i.e., including nuclear and extended emission) to evaluate the radio loudness, while Ho (2002)\nonly took into account the nuclear emission. In spite\nof the difference, the trends of decreasing radio loudness with increasing Eddington ratio were consistent.\n(Falcke et al. 1995) argued that the difference between\nradio loud and radio weak is established already on the\nparsec scale. Therefore the above trends actually characterize the property of cores, implying the radio loudness\nof cores to be lower in early epochs. These trends are\nconsistent with the property of core RLF we obtained.\nThe epoch-dependent radio loudness was also found by\nJiang et al. (2007). Using a sample of more than 30,000\noptically selected quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), they found the radio-loud fraction of quasars\nis a strong function of redshift, i.e., the radio-loud fraction decreases rapidly with increasing redshift. They also\nused the R parameter to characterize the degree of radio\nloudness, and chose R > 10 to define radio-loud quasars.\nIt is shown that the radio loudness of quasars are weaker\nat higher redshifts, thus the fraction of radio loud quasars\nis lower in earlier epochs. Considering that most of the\nradio loud quasars in their sample are core-dominated FR\nI instead of FR II, their result that the radio-loud fraction of quasars negatively evolves with redshift is also in\nagreement with our result of core RLF.\nBesides, as a good supplement to the above studies,\nRafter et al. (2009) investigated how the radio loud frac-\n\ntion of AGNs changed as a function of Eddington ratio.\nThey found that 4.7% of the AGNs in their flux-limited\nsubsample are radio loud based on core radio emission\nalone. The radio loud fraction decreases from 13% to 2%\nas Eddington ratio increases over 2.5 orders of magnitude. This result is consistent with the above findings,\nand also supports the result of our core RLF.\n4.3. The analogy with XRBs\nInterestingly, it has become increasingly clear that\nmany aspects of BH accretion and jet formation are\ndirectly comparable between AGNs and X-ray binary\n(XRB) systems (e.g. Fender et al. 2010; K\u00f6rding et al.\n2006). The XRBs may help one to understand the radio\nemission evolution of AGNs. Studies (see Fender et al.\n2004, 2010) have shown that the jet power associated\nwith radio emission, as well as the radiative efficiency of\nthe accretion flow, can change dramatically among different accretion states for XRBs. In the so-called low/hard\nstate, the Eddington ratio is very low (below about 0.01),\nand a compact self-absorbed jet with radio flat spectrum\nappears. With the arrival of higher Eddington ratios,\nsources can switch into 'softer' states in which the radio\nemission is dramatically suppressed or even quenching. It\nimplies a scenario of jet formation that the jet contributing radio emission is more easily produced in sources with\nlower accretion ratio. For AGNs, the Eddington ratios\ntrend to be higher in early epochs and suppress the production of jet contributing radio emission, their core radio emission is then weaker at higher refshifts. When\nthe Eddington ratios decrease with decreasing redshifts,\nAGNs easily produce the jet to contribute strong core\nradio emission. Our core RLF confirms that the jet is\nmore easily formed in sources with lower accretion ratio.\n\n\f8\n\nYuan & Wang\n\n4.4. The different evolution of radio cores and lobes\nIt is well known that the cores and the extended lobes\nare related in matter and energy by jet. The core-total\npower correlation (see Fig.6) is thus the immediate representation of this relation. Our results indicate that, however, they behave different evolution pattern and could\nnot be co-evolving. We believe that some factors could\naffect their evolution connection. Firstly, the long distance between the core and lobe delays the exchange of\nmatter and energy, and weaken their co-evolution. For a\n100-kpc AGN jet, we see the core change up to 1 Myr earlier than the near lobe, assuming a jet velocity of 0.1c (c\nis the velocity of light). Besides, the lobes are inevitably\naffected by intergalactic environment, leading to the evolution uncertainty. The lobes expand in the intergalactic\nmedium (IGM), while the cores are located in interstellar medium. Different environments (such as magnetic\nfield and particle number density) will lead distinct energy loss processes (e.g. Kaiser 2009). Compared with\nlobes, the radio radiation properties of cores are more\nsensitive to the accretion states of central BHs. As enormous reservoirs of energy and relativistic electrons, the\nlobes, even if the radio cores have been quenching, may\nstill remain detectable for a long time if they are subject only to radiative losses of the relativistic electrons\n(Murgia et al. 2011). Assuming a typical magnetic intensity of 1.5 nT (1 nT = 10\u03bcG, see Croston et al. 2005)\nof the lobes, the fading time of the lobes at 408 MHz is\nestimated as,\ntf a \u2243 tsy = 6.0 \u00d7 107 (\n\n\u03bd\nB \u22123/2\n)\n(\n)\u22121/2 yr (11)\nnT\n0.5GHz\n\nwhich is about 107 years.\nThe episodic AGN activity could also affect the connection of evolution between lobes and cores. There has\nbeen a growing body of evidence to suggest that AGN activity could be episodic, although the range of time scales\ninvolved needs to be investigated further (e.g. Best 2007;\nBrocksopp et al. 2011; Saikia & Jamrozy 2009). During\nthe phase of inactivity, the energy supply from core to\nextended regions ceases and a source is expected to undergo a period of fading before it disappears completely\n(Marecki & Szablewski 2009). In this case, sources may\nlack certain features, such as radio cores or well-defined\njets that are produced by continuing activity. Comparatively, the radio lobes are not so sensitive to continuing activity than radio cores. Alternatively, during the\nphase of reactivation, one may expect to observe fossil\nradio lobes remaining from an earlier active epoch, along\nwith newly restarting jets and cores (Murgia et al. 2011).\nIn this case, the lobes are already disconnected from the\ncurrently active jets and cores.\n5. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe concentrate our efforts on the study of the correlation between radio galaxies/QSOs and their cores via radio luminosity functions. Using a large combined sample\nof 1063 radio-loud AGNs selected at low radio frequency,\nwe investigate the radio luminosity function (RLF) at\n408 MHz band. We also estimate the core RLF at 5\nGHz band based on the 3CRR sample and the combined\nsample. Main results are follow as:\n1. In agrement with previous results, we note a strong\ncorrelation between core and total radio power for\nRGs and QSOs, but the correlations has large dispersion, especially for QSOs. We find that the total\npower of RGs more strongly depend on core radio\npower compared to QSOs.\n2. Looking at the possible existence of a 'redshift cutoff', the steep-spectrum RLFs we obtained do not\nshow an obvious density decline for powerful radio\nsources beyond z \u223c 2.5 over the whole luminosity\nrange. We argue that the evolution of radio AGNs\nis luminosity-dependent, while the so-called 'redshift cut-off' in steep-spectrum population is not\nobvious in our result of RLFs.\n3. The core RLFs we obtained show that the comoving number density of radio cores has a persistent\ndecline with redshift, implying a negative density\nevolution. We believe that the radio core emission\ncould be gradually powered by central engines, or\ntheir radio-loudness be epoch dependent.\n4. It is noticed that the core RLF is obviously different from the total RLF at 408 MHz band which\nis mainly contributed by extended lobes, implying\nthat the core and extended lobes could not be coevolving at radio emission.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe are grateful to the referee for very useful comments\nthat improved this paper.

THE COMBINED SAMPLE\n\nThe list of combined sample of radio galaxies/QSOs. The table has been arranged as follows:\nColumn (1). Source name in IAU designation (B1950). An asterisk following the source name indicates that the\nsource should be excluded from the combined sample for the reason explained in section 2. They are put in the table\njust for reference.\nColumn (2). Other name if available.\nColumn (3). Redshift. The redshift with a suffix e is estimated by the empirical relation of R \u2212 z or K \u2212 z as\nmentioned in section 2.2. Otherwise, redshifts are spectroscopic.\nColumn (4). Total flux density at 408 MHz in Jy. For the 3CRR sample, these fluxes are from literature or\nextrapolated from 178 MHz fluxes.\nColumn (5). Spectral index \u03b1 near 408 MHz (where S = \u03bd \u2212\u03b1 ).\nColumn (6). Core flux density at 5 GHz in mJy.\nColumn (7). Core spectral index \u03b1c near 5 GHz. Generally, core spectral index information is far from abundant in\nliterature. Most of our sources with core fluxes do not have core spectral indices. For these sources, we simply assume\na flat spectrum, \u03b1c = 0, in order to calculate core luminosities.\nColumn (8). References. For the 3CRR sample, these are mainly references for total and core fulx densities as\nwell as core spectral indices; for other samples, these are mainly references for redshifts, core flux densities and core\nspectral indices. The references for total flux densities at 5 GHz, which are used to calculate the Rc -parameter (see\nsection 2.5), are also arranged in this column.\nColumn (9). The sub-sample name. e.g. 3CRR: the 3CRR sample; MS4: the Molonglo southern 4 Jy sample;\nMRC1: the MRC 1-Jy sample; BRL: the BRL sample.\n\n\f"}
