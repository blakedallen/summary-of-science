This method\nrests on the fact that bosons obey the Bose-Einstein statistics so that the symmetrisation of\nthe multi-particle wave function affects the measured many-particle coincident spectra to lead\nto an enhancement, relative to the single particle spectra, whenever they are emitted close by\nin time-phase space. Thus the interest in the Bose-Einstein correlation properties was not only\nrestricted to their fundamental quantum theoretical aspects but above all as a tool in the study\nof the properties and spatial extent of sources emitting radiation and particles in the fields of\nastronomy, and non-perturbative QCD aspects of particles and nuclei interactions.\n\nFigure 1: The two indistinguishable diagrams that describe the emission of two identical bosons, \u03c01\nand \u03c02 , emerging from the two points, r1 and r2 , which lie within an emitter volume, and are detected\nat the positions x1 and x2 .\nThe difference between the intensity interferometry and the conventional amplitude interferometry can be illustrated [4,5] with the help of Fig. 1. Consider a finite source which emits two\nindistinguishable particles from the positions r1 and r2 which are later observed at positions x1\nand x2 . In an amplitude interferometry the positions x1 and x2 could be a slit through which\nthe emitted particles pass. The particles could then produce an interference pattern which\nwill depend on the relative phase of the particle's amplitude as measured at x1 and x2 . In an\n\u223c\nintensity interferometry a normalised correlation function K (1, 2) of the particles 1 and 2 is\nformed from the average number hn1,2 i of counts where n1 and n2 are detected simultaneously\nat x1 and x2 :\n\u223c\nhn1,2 i\n\u2212 1.\n(1)\nK (1, 2) =\nhn1 ihn2 i\nThe correlation function is thus proportional to the intensity of the particles at x1 and x2 .\nBecause of the symmetrisation of their wave function, identical particles can have a nonzero\ncorrelation function even if the particles are otherwise noninteracting.\nAs can be expected intensity interferometry is closely related to the amplitude interferometry\nwhich essentially measures the square of the amplitudes A1 and A2 falling on the detectors x1\nand x2 :\n|A1 + A2 |2 = |A1 |2 + |A2 |2 + (A\u22c61 A2 + A1 A\u22c62 ) ,\n\nwhere the last term is the fringe visibility denoted by V , which is the part of the signal which\nis sensitive to the separation between the emission points. Averaged over random variations its\n2\n\n\fsquare is given by the product of the intensities landing on the two detectors:\n2\n2 \u22c62\nhV 2 i = 2h|A1|2 |A2 |2 i + hA\u22c62\n1 A2 i + hA1 A2 i \u2192 2hI1 I2 i .\n\nSince the last two terms of the hV 2 i expression vary rapidly and average to zero, hV 2 i is proportional to the time averaged correlation of the product of the two intensities (see e.g. Ref. [6]).\nThe Bose-Einstein correlation (BEC) analysis method was for the first time introduced in\n1959/60 by Goldhaber, Goldhaber, Lee and Pais (GGLP) [7, 8] to the hadron sector in order\nto study the time-space structure of identical pions produced in particle interactions. Their\nobservation of a BEC enhancement of pion-pairs emerging from pp annihilations at small relative momenta was parametrised in terms of the finite spatial extension of the pp source and the\nfinite localisation of the decay pions. The momentum range of the enhancement could then be\nrelated to the size of the particle source in space coordinates. Since then the boson interferometry has been used extensively in variety of particle interactions and over a wide range of energies.\n\nrrms(fm)\n\nIn the mid 1990's the boson intensity interferometry measurement method has been extended to the spin 1/2 baryon sector utilising the Fermi-Dirac statistical properties and in\nparticular the Pauli exclusion principle [9]. Already the results from the first attempt to study\nthe Fermi-Dirac correlation (FDC) of the \u039b\u039b and \u039b\u039b pairs, emerging from the decay of the\ngauge Z 0 boson, indicated that the spatial extension of the hadron source is strongly dependent\non its mass.\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4 1/3\n\nA\n\nFigure 2: An early compilation of values obtained for the emitter dimension rrms , extracted from\ninterferometry analyses of identical charged pion-pairs produced in heavy ion collisions are displayed\nas a function of A1/3 where A is the atomic number of the projectile. The values are taken from\nRef. [10] and whenever more than one value is quoted for a given projectile nucleus, the plotted data\npoints represent the average weighted values. The solid line represents the relation rrms = 1.2 \u00d7 A1/3\nfm.\n\nIn parallel to the BEC studies of hadronic final states produced in particle reactions, extensive pion-pair correlation analyses were and are applied to heavy ion collisions in order to\nexplore the characteristics of these rather complex reactions [6, 11, 12]. A compilation, taken\n3\n\n\ffrom Ref. [10], of the spatial dimension, rrms , extracted from the BEC of two identical charged\npions emerging from nucleus-nucleus collisions, is shown in Fig. 2 as a function of A1/3 where\nA is the atomic number of the projectile nucleus. As seen in Fig. 2, rrms increases more or\nless linearly with A1/3 . Moreover, as seen from the figure, the line rrms = 1.2\u00d7A1/3 fm, which\ncorresponds to the dependence of the nucleus radius on its atomic number A, follows rather\nwell the BEC derived spatial dimensions. This observation, as well as the results from the HBT\nanalyses in astronomy, led to the expectation that BEC should also render information on the\ngeometrical extension of the hadron emitter source in particle collisions.\nThe main purpose of the present report is to cover the field of BEC analyses applied to\nhadrons produced in particle collisions and only refer to heavy ion reactions whenever a comparison between the two classes of reactions is of a particular interest. A special emphasis is\ngiven to recent developments in the particle interferometry such as the inclusion of identical\nfermion correlations and the new results concerning the spatial dimension dependence on the\nhadron mass. Furthermore, the report is aimed mainly to cover the experimental aspects of\nthe BEC and FDC interferometry and their direct physics implication and achievements while\ntrying to restrict the theoretical discussions to essentials so as not to overburden the non-expert\nreader.\nThe organisation of this report is as follows. The basic concepts of bosons and fermions interferometry are discussed in sections 2 and 3. In section 4 details concerning the experimental\naspects of the correlation measurements are described. Results obtained from the 1-dimensional\ncorrelation analyses are summarised in section 5. The observation that the spatial dimension\ndeduced from the correlation measurements depends on the hadron mass is evaluated in section\n6 and conceivable grounds for this behaviour are discussed. Results obtained from the multidimensional correlation analyses are dealt with in section 7 and a relation between interatomic\nseparation in Bose condensates and the spatial dimension of hadrons emerging in high energy\nreaction is illustrated. In section 8 the question concerning the interpretation of the BEC and\nFDC deduced geometrical dimension is discussed. Finally a summary is presented in section 9.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nBasic concepts in particle interferometry\nThe Bose-Einstein correlation of two hadrons\n\nIn deriving the main expressions used for the boson interferometry we follow closely Ref. [13].\nAs it is well known in quantum mechanics the interchange of two out of N indistinguishable\nbosons does not change the wave function describing this multi-boson state. This feature of\nthe Bose-Einstein statistics means that the state \u03a8 has the property that\n\u03a8(1, 2, * * * , N) = \u03a8(2, 1, * * * , N) ,\n\nwhich leads to an interference term in |\u03a8|2 that enhances near in time-phase space the production of indistinguishable bosons. Let us first consider a source of discrete emission points, \u03c1i ,\neach characterised by a probability amplitude Fi (r) in the 3-vector ri phase space\nFi (r) = \u03c1i \u03b4 3 (r \u2212 ri ) .\n4\n\n\fNext we introduce the central assumption pertaining to the BEC effect namely, the chaotic\nor the total incoherence limit, which corresponds to the situation where the phases of the\nproduction amplitudes wildly fluctuate in every point of space. In this limit all the phases can\nbe set to zero. If \u03c8k (r) is the wave function of the emitted particle, then the total probability\nP (k) to observe the emission of one particle with a 3-momentum vector k is given by summing\nup the contributions from all the i points, that is\nX\n\nP (k) =\n\ni\n\n|\u03c1i \u03c8(ri )|2 .\n\nFor simplicity we will further use plane wave functions \u03c8k \u221d ei(kr+\u03c6) where in the incoherent\ncase we can set \u03c6 = 0. Next we replace the sum by an integral so that\nZ\n\nP (k) =\n\n|\u03c1(r)|2 d3 r .\n\n(2)\n\nThe probability to observe two particles with momenta k1 and k2 is\nP (k1 , k2 ) =\n\nZ\n\n|\u03c81,2 |2 |\u03c1(r1 )|2 |\u03c1(r2 )|2 d3 r1 d3 r2 ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c81,2 = \u03c81,2 (k1 , k2 , r1 , r2 ) is the two-particle wave function.\nTaking incoherent plane waves, then for two identical bosons the symmetrised \u03c81,2 is of the\nform\ni\n1 h\ns\n= \u221a ei(k1 r1 +k2 r2 ) + ei(k1 r2 +k2 r1 )\n\u03c81,2\n(4)\n2\nso that\ns 2\n|\u03c81,2\n| = 1 + cos[(k1 \u2212 k2 )(r1 \u2212 r2 )] = 1 + cos[\u2206k(r1 \u2212 r2 )] .\n(5)\n\nUsing Eqs. (2), (3) and (5) one can define a second order correlation function\nP (k1 , k2 )\nC2 (k1 , k2 ) \u2261\n= 1 +\nP (k1 )P (k2)\n\nR\n\ncos[\u2206k(r1 \u2212 r2 )]|\u03c1(r1 )|2 |\u03c1(r2 )|2 d3 r1 d3 r2\n,\nP (k1 )P (k2 )\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u2206k = k1 \u2212 k2 . Assuming that the emitter extension \u03c1(r) is localised in space and time\nthen it follows that when \u2206k = 0 the last term of Eq. (6) can vary between the values 0 to\n1. From Eq. (6) one obtains after integration (Fourier transformation)\nC2 (\u2206k) = 1 + |\u03c1(\u2206k)|2 .\nIn many of the two-boson one dimensional BEC analyses one uses the Lorentz invariant parameter Q, defined as Q2 = Q22 = \u2212(q1 \u2212 q2 )2 \u2261 M22 \u2212 4\u03bc2 . Here q1 , q2 and M22 are respectively\nthe 4-momentum vectors and the invariant mass squared of the two identical bosons of mass \u03bc.\nThus one obtains\nC2 (Q) = 1 + |\u03c1(Q)|2 .\n(7)\nAssuming further that the source is described by a spherical symmetric Gaussian density distribution of emitting centres\n\u2212\n\n\u03c1(r) = \u03c1(0)e\n\nr2\n2r 2\n0\n\n,\n\nthen the Bose-Einstein correlation function assumes the form\n2\n\n2\n\nC2 (\u2206k) = 1 + e\u2212r0 \u2206k .\n5\n\n\fIn terms of the variable Q and the dimension rG , introduced by Goldhaber et al. [7, 8], the\ncorrelation function in the completely chaotic limit is equal to\n2\n\n2\n\nC2 (Q) = 1 + e\u2212rG Q .\n\n(8)\n\nIn the completely coherent case it can be shown [14] that C2 (Q) = 1. In order to accommodate\nthose cases where the source is not completely chaotic one introduces a chaoticity parameter\n\u03bb2 which can vary between the value 0, corresponding to a complete coherent case, to the value\n1 at the total chaotic limit. Thus Eq. (8) is transformed to the GGLP form\n2\n\n2\n\nC2 (Q) = N(1 + \u03bb2 e\u2212rG Q ) ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere N is added as a normalisation factor. Since the strength of the BEC effect depends\nalso on the experimental data quality, like the purity of the identical boson sample, \u03bb2 is often\nalso referred to as the BEC strength parameter. In the following, unless otherwise stated,\nwe will denote by r the dimension values obtained from BEC analyses which used the GGLP\nparametrisation, that is r \u2261 rG . Two examples of a typical behaviour of the correlation function\nC2 (Q) of identical charged pion-pairs are shown in Fig. 3. The first are the results of OPAL [15]\nwhere the pion-pairs were taken from the hadronic Z 0 decays and the second reported by the\nZEUS collaboration [16] in their study of the deep inelastic ep scattering produced at the HERA\ncollider.\n\nC\n\nZEUS\nQ2\n\n+ ZEUS (prel.) 98-00\nAE (in luded in the t)\n\n1.8\n\nOPAL\nN(\u00b1\u00b1)/NBG\n\n1.6\n\n> 110 GeV2\n\nwith FSI\nwithout FSI\n\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n\nKS0\n\n\u001a0\n\n0.8\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\nQ [GeV/c]\n\n1.5\n\n2\nQ (GeV)\n\nFigure 3: The \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u00b1 BEC as a function of Q.

[17] respectively with and without\nthe inclusion of final state interactions (see Sec. 4.2). Right: ZEUS results obtained in deep inelastic\nep scattering with momentum transfer of Q2 > 110 GeV2 [16]. The regions of KS0 and \u03c10 which were\nomitted from the fit of the correlation function C2 (Q) are indicated.\n\n2.2\n\nThe Kopylov-Podgoretskii parametrisation\n\nIn addition to the Goldhaber parametrisation, given by Eq. (9), another favourite parametrisation is that proposed by Kopylov and Podgoretskii (KP) [18\u201320] which corresponds to a\n6\n\n\fradiating sphere surface of radius rKP with incoherent point-like oscillators of lifetime \u03c4 , namely\n2\nC(qt , q0 ) = 1 + \u03bb[4J12 (qt rKP )/(qt rKP\n]/[1 + (q0 \u03c4 )2 ] ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere J1 is the first-order Bessel function. Here q0 is equal to |E1 \u2212 E2 | and qt = |q \u00d7 k|/|k|\nwhere k = k1 +k2 , the sum of the two hadron momenta and q = k1 \u2212k2 is the difference between\nthem. This correlation expression is not Lorentz invariant and its variables are calculated in\nthe centre of mass system (CMS) of the final state hadrons. The correlation function C(qt , q0 )\ncan be written in terms of the Goldhaber geometrical parameter rG as [21]\n2 2\n2 2\nC(qt , q0 ) = 1 + \u03bb exp[\u2212rG\nqt \u2212 rG\nq0 /(\u03b3 2 \u2212 1)] ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is the \u03b3\u2212factor of the identical boson pair. From a comparison between Eqs. (11) and\n(9) it is clear that the parameters rG and rKP have different interpretations. At small qt and\nq0 , however, the parametrisation (10) can be approximated to be\nC(qt , q0 ) = 1 + \u03bb exp[\u2212(rKP /2)2 qt2 \u2212 (q0 \u03c4 )2 ] .\n\n(12)\n\nFrom Eqs. (11) and (12) one finds the approximate relation rKP \u2243 2rG which is verified experimentally. For example, in a study [22] of the BEC of the \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u00b1 system emerging from the\ndecay of the Z 0 boson one obtained rG = 0.955 \u00b1 0.012(stat.) \u00b1 0.015(syst.) fm as compared\nto rKP = 1.778 \u00b1 0.023(stat.) \u00b1 0.036(syst.) fm.\nIn contrast to the rather simple and straightforward BEC analysis offered by the GGLP\nparametrisation, the KP method expects a correlation enhancement at low, near zero, q0 values\nso that the analysis is carried out in several q0 energy slices. In addition the KP formalism\nhas an extra free parameter, (q0 \u03c4 )2 , which has to be determined through a fit to the data.\nFor these reasons the KP correlation investigations require higher statistical data samples than\nthose needed for the BEC analysis in the GGLP method.\n\n2.3\n\nHigher order Bose-Einstein correlations\n\nA Bose-Einstein correlation enhancement is also expected to be present in identical boson\nsystems of more than two particles when they emerge from the interaction within a small timespace region. In the search for these so called, higher order BEC enhancements, one has to\ndifferentiate between those produced from the lower BEC order(s) and those who are genuine\ncorrelations. The normalised over-all inclusive correlations of n identical bosons is given by [23]\nRn\n\n\u03c1n (p1 , p2 * * * pn )\ndn \u03c3\n=\n= \u03c3 n\u22121\n\u03c11 (p1 )\u03c11 (p2 ) * * * \u03c11 (pn )\ndp1 dp2 * * * dpn\n\n,\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\nd\u03c3 \uf8f4\nd\u03c3 d\u03c3\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n***\n\uf8fe ,\ndp1 dp2\ndpn\n\uf8fc\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u03c3 is the total boson production cross section, \u03c11 (pi ) and d\u03c3/dpi are the single-boson density in momentum space and the inclusive cross section, respectively. Similarly \u03c1n (p1 , p2 * * * pn )\nand dn \u03c3/(dp1dp2 * * * dpn ) are respectively the density of the n-boson system and its inclusive\ncross section. The product of the independent one-particle densities \u03c11 (p1 )\u03c11 (p2 ) * * * \u03c11 (pn ) is\nreferred to as the reference density distribution, or reference sample, to which the measured\ncorrelations are compared to. Specifically the inclusive two-boson density \u03c12 (p1 , p2 ) can be\nwritten as:\n\u03c12 (p1 , p2 ) = \u03c11 (p1 )\u03c11 (p2 ) + K2 (p1 , p2 ) ,\n(14)\n7\n\n\fwhere \u03c11 (p1 )\u03c11 (p2 ) represents the two independent boson momentum spectra and K2 (p1 , p2 )\ndescribes the two-body correlations. In this simple case of two identical bosons the normalised\ndensity function R2 , defined by Eq. (13), already measures the genuine two-body correlations\nwhich here (see Sec. 2.1) is referred to as the C2 correlation function. Thus one has\n\u223c\n\nC2 \u2261 R2 = 1+ K 2 (p1 , p2 ) ,\n\n(15)\n\n\u223c\n\nwhere K 2 (p1 , p2 ) = K2 (p1 , p2 )/[\u03c11 (p1 )\u03c11 (p2 )] is the normalised two-body correlation term which\nin the GGLP parametrisation defined in Eq. (9), is equal to \u03bb2 exp(\u2212Q22 r22 ).\nThe inclusive correlation of three identical bosons, \u03c13 (p1 , p2 , p3 ), includes the three independent boson momentum spectra, the two-particle correlation K2 and the genuine three-particle\ncorrelation K3 , namely:\n\u03c13 (p1 , p2 , p3 ) = \u03c11 (p1 )\u03c11 (p2 )\u03c11 (p3 ) +\n\nX\n\n\u03c11 (pi )K2 (pj , pk ) + K3 (p1 , p2 , p3 ) ,\n\n(16)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the summation is taken over all the three possible permutations. The normalised inclusive\nthree-body density, is then given by\nR3 =\nHere\nR1,2 =\n\n\u223c\n\u03c13 (p1 , p2 , p3 )\n= 1 + R1,2 + K 3 (p1 , p2 , p3 ) .\n\u03c11 (p1 )\u03c11 (p2 )\u03c11 (p3 )\n\n\u03c11 (pi )K2 (pj , pk )\n\u03c11 (p1 )\u03c11 (p2 )\u03c11 (p3 )\n\nP\n\n(3)\n\n\u223c\n\nand\n\nK 3 (p1 , p2 , p3 ) =\n\n(17)\n\nK3 (p1 , p2 , p3 )\n\u03c11 (p1 )\u03c11 (p2 )\u03c11 (p3 )\n\nrepresent the mixed three-boson system in which only two of them are correlated and the threeboson correlation. In analogy to C2 , one defines a correlation function C3 which measures the\ngenuine three-boson correlation, by subtracting from R3 the term which contains the two-boson\ncorrelation contribution. Thus\n\u223c\n\nC3 \u2261 R3 \u2212 R1,2 = 1+ K 3 (p1 , p2 , p3 ) ,\n\n(18)\n\nwhich depends only on the genuine three-boson correlation. For the study of the three-boson\ncorrelation one often uses the variable Q3 which, analogous to the variable Q22 , is defined as\nQ23 =\n\nX\n(3)\n\n2\nqi,j\n= M32 \u2212 9\u03bc2 ,\n\nwhere the summation is taken over all the three different i, j boson-pairs. Here M32 is the\ninvariant mass squared of the three-boson system and \u03bc is the mass of the single boson. From\nthe definition of this three-boson variable it is clear that as Q3 approaches zero so do all the three\nrelated qi,j values which eventually reach the region where the two-boson BEC enhancements\nare observed. It has been shown [24] that the genuine three-pion correlation function C3 (Q3 )\ncan be parametrised by the expression\n2 2\n\nC3 (Q3 ) = 1 + 2\u03bb3 e\u2212Q3 r3 ,\nwhere \u03bb3 is the chaoticity parameter which may assume a value between zero and one.\n8\n\n(19)\n\n\fThe method outlined here for the extraction of the three-boson BEC enhancement can in\nprinciple be extended to higher orders, however it becomes too cumbersome to be of a practical\nuse and on top of it, it requires very high statistics data. For these reasons two other approaches\nhave been advocated and utilised experimentally. In the first, one measures experimentally the\nover-all correlation, as defined by Rn in Eq. (13), and then with the help of various models\none tries to extract the higher order genuine BEC parameters rn and \u03bbn . Such an approach is\nadopted for example in references [25,26]. In the second approach one analyses the data in terms\nof correlation functions [27, 28] known as factorial cumulant moments or, in their integrated\nform are referred to as the semi-invariant cumulants of Thiele which constitutes an important\nelement in proving the central limit theorem in statistics (see e.g. [29]). Having n particles\nin a given domain then the corresponding factorial cumulant moments will be different from\nzero only if a genuine n-particle correlation exists. The shortcoming of the cumulant approach\nis however the fact that its results for a given higher order (n \u2265 3) pertain to the overall\ngenuine correlation present in the data so that the partial contribution of the genuine BEC,\nparametrised by rn and \u03bbn is not transparent.\n\n2.4\n\nBose-Einstein correlation in two and three dimensions\n\nIn the GGLP interferometry analysis the emitter shape is considered to be of a spherical shape\nwith a Gaussian density distribution. A method to explore the possibility that the time-space\nextent of the particle emission region deviates from a sphere, and in fact is characterised by\nmore than one dimension, has been recently proposed [11,30,31]. To this end the BEC analysis\nis carried out in the Longitudinal Centre-of-Mass System (LCMS) shown schematically in Fig.\n4. This coordinate system is defined for each pair of identical bosons as the system in which\np+p\n1\n\n2\n\np\nQt,out\n\n2\n\np-p\n\n1 2\n\np\n\n1\n\nQuark / jet / thrust\nQ\n\nlong\n\ne\nsid\n\nQ t,\n\nFigure 4: The Longitudinal Centre-of-Mass-System coordinates (taken from Ref. [32]).\nthe sum of the boson-pair 3-momenta p1 + p2 , referred to as the out - axis, is perpendicular to\nthe thrust (or jet) direction of the multi-hadron event defined as the z - axis (\u2261 long - axis).\nThe momentum difference of the pion-pair Q is then resolved into the longitudinal direction\nQz \u2261 Q|| parallel to the thrust axis, to the Qout - axis which is collinear with the pair momenta\nsum and the third axis, Qside which is perpendicular to both Qz and Qout . In this system the\nprojections of the total momentum of the particle-pair onto the longitudinal and side directions\n9\n\n\fare equal to zero. The total Q2 value is given by\np1,out + p2,out\n.\nE1 + E2\nHere the indices 1 and 2 refer to the first and second boson. Since p1,z = \u2212p2,z one has\nQ2 = Q2z + Q2side + Q2out (1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 ),\n\nwhere \u03b2 =\n\n(20)\n\nQz = Qk = p1,z \u2212 p2,z = 2p1,z = 2pz .\n\nThe difference in the emission time of the pions, which couples to the energy difference between\nthem, appears only in the Qout direction. The 3-dimension correlation function is given by\n2\n\n2\n\nC2 (Qz , Qside , Qout ) = 1 + \u03bb2 e\u2212(rz Qz\n\n2\n2 Q2 )\n+ rside\nQ2side + rout\nout\n\n.\n\n(21)\n\nIn many cases due to lack of sufficient statistics, one wishes to reduce the number of parameters to be fitted in the correlation function by defining the transverse component rT in the\n2\n2\nLCMS to be rT2 = rside\n+ rout\ncorresponding to\nQ2T = Q2out + Q2side .\nThus the correlation function, which is fitted to the data, is of the form\n2\n\n2\n\nC2 (Qz , QT ) = 1 + \u03bb2 e\u2212(rz Qz\n\n2 Q2 )\n+ rT\nT\n\n,\n\n(22)\n\nwhere rz , estimated from Eq. (22) as Qz approaches zero, is the longitudinal geometrical radius\nand rT is composed of the transverse radius and the emission time difference. The experimental\nfindings in heavy ion collisions [33, 34], in hadron-hadron reactions [35, 36] and e+ e\u2212 annihilations [37\u201339], verify the theoretical expectations of the Lund string model [40,41] that the ratio\nrT /rz is significantly smaller than one (see Sec. 4.1.2).\nThe assignment of a well defined physical direction in the LCMS, such as thrust axis, allows\nto study in the framework of the BEC analysis an additional meaningful variable namely, the\naverage transverse mass mT of the two identical hadrons. This transverse mass is defined as\nq\ni\n1\n1 hq 2\nmT = [m1,T + m2,T ] =\n(23)\nm1 + p21,T + m22 + p22,T ,\n2\n2\nwhere the indices 1 and 2 refer to the first and second hadron.\n\n3\n\nFermi-Dirac correlation\n\nThe application of two-boson correlation to the estimation of an r dimension has recently been\nextended to identical pairs of fermions (baryons) [9]. This extension is based on the Fermi-Dirac\nstatistics feature which prohibit the total spin to have the value S = S1 + S2 = 1 when the two\nidentical fermions are in an s-wave (l = 0) state. Thus in the so called Fermi-Dirac correlation\n(FDC) method one can, similarly to the BEC analysis, study the contributions of the S = 0 and\nS = 1 states to the di-fermion system as Q approaches zero where, in the absence of di-baryon\nresonances, only the s-wave state survives.\nThe estimation of r from the rate of depletion of the S = 1 population as Q \u2192 0 can be\nachieved in two ways. The first consists of a direct measurement of the relative contributions of\nS = 1 and S = 0 spin states to the di-baryon system as a function of Q (see next section). An\nalternative method consists of a measurement of the di-baryon density decrease as Q approaches\nzero, assuming its origin to be due to the Pauli exclusion principle. This second method is\nequivalent to that used in the BEC analysis of two identical bosons.\n10\n\n\f3.1\n\nThe spin-spin correlation\n\nIf F0 (Q) and F1 (Q) are respectively the fraction of the S = 0 and the S = 1 contributions, at\na given Q value, to the di-baryon system then one can e.g. study two correlation functions,\nCS=0 (Q) and CS=1(Q), defined by the ratios:\nC0 (Q) =\n\n2F0 (Q)\nF0 (Q) + F1 (Q)/3\n\nand\n\nC1 (Q) =\n\n2F1 (Q)/3\n,\nF0 (Q) + F1 (Q)/3\n\n2\n\n1/N dN/dy\n\nC (Q)\n\nwhere F1 (Q) is divided by 3 to offset the statistical 2S + 1 spin factor.

The dashed line represents the expectation\nfor a baryon anti-baryon system in the absence of resonances. (b) The (1/N )dN/dy behaviour of the\nS = 0 and S = 1 states of a two identical baryons sample.\n\nthe highest angular momentum lmax is large, one may expect that C0 \u223c\n= 1 corresponding\n= C1 \u223c\nto a statistical spin mixture ensemble. On the other hand when Q = 0, one will observe\nC0 \u2248 2 and C1 \u2248 0. Thus the C0 behaviour as a function of Q is similar to the BEC function\nC2 (Q), of two identical mesons, which rises as the lmax \u2192 0. As for the di-baryon correlation\nfunction C1 (Q) there is no parallel case in the identical charged di-boson system. One further\nassumes the emitter to be a sphere with a Gaussian distribution so that, analogous to the BEC\nparametrisation, the di-baryon correlation functions can be parametrised as [9]:\nC0 (Q) = 1 + \u03bbe\u2212r\n\n2 Q2\n\nand\n\nC1 (Q) = 1 \u2212 \u03bbe\u2212r\n\n2 Q2\n\n.\n\nHere the \u03bb parameter, which can vary between 0 and 1, measures the strength of the effect and\nis mainly sensitive to the purity of the data sample. A schematic view of the dependence of\nC0 and C1 on Q is shown in Fig. 5a. The study of either C0 or C1 can render a value for r\nhowever, since the diminishing contribution of the S = 1 state is responsible for the variation\nof the correlation function as Q decreases, one usually analyses C1 . Here it should be noted\nthat unlike the BEC effect which can be extended to many-boson states, the FDC is limited to\ntwo identical fermions since already the third one is in an l > 0 state (Pauli exclusion principle).\n\n11\n\n\fA general method for the direct measurement of the total spin composition of any two spin\n1/2 baryons system which decay weakly has been outlined in reference [9]. Here we illustrate\nthis method (later referred as Method I) in its application to the \u039b\u039b and the \u039b\u039b systems. The\nsimplest measurable case is the one where the \u039b decays into p1 + \u03c0 \u2212 and the other \u039b, or \u039b, to\np2 + \u03c0 + where pi stands for the decay proton or anti-proton both of which we will further refer\nto as protons. Let us further denote by y the cosine of the angle (in space) between p1 and\np2 and hyi as its average, defined in a system reached after two transformations. The first, to\nthe CMS of the di-\u039b pair and the second where each proton is transformed to the CMS of its\nparent \u039b. To note is that at Q = 0 the second transformation is superfluous.\nIn the decay of a single \u039b, the proton angular distribution with respect to the spin direction\nin the centre of mass, is given by [42]:\ndw/d cos \u03b8 \u221d 1 \u2212 \u03b1\u039b cos \u03b8 ,\n\n(24)\n\nwhere the parity violating parameter \u03b1\u039b = \u2212\u03b1\u039b was measured experimentally [43] to be\n0.642 \u00b1 0.013. Setting x = cos \u03b8 the average hx\u039b i is given by:\nZ xmax\n1 Z 2\u03c0\nhx\u039b i =\nd\u03c6\n(1 \u2212 \u03b1\u039b x)xdx\n2\u03c0N 0\nxmin\n\nwhere\n\nN =\n\nZ\n\nxmax\n\nxmin\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03b1\u039b x)dx .\n\n(25)\n\nIn particular, the average over the whole angular range from xmin = \u22121 to xmax = +1 yields\nhx\u039b i = \u22120.214 \u00b1 0.004 and hx\u039b i = +0.214 \u00b1 0.004 .\nGeneral arguments do not allow dN/dy distribution of a two spin-1/2 hyperon system at\nthreshold to have a y dependence higher than its first power. This means that dN/dy is of the\nform\ndN/dy = A[1 + BS y] .\nThe factor BS can then be determined independent of the total angular momentum J value at\nQ = 0 or nearby from the value of hyi using the Wigner-Eckart theorem [44, 45]. Thus for the\n\u039b\u039b and \u039b\u039b pairs one obtains\nBS=0 = \u22129 hx\u039b i2 = \u22120.4122\n\nand\n\nBS=1 = +3 hx\u039b i2 = +0.1374 .\n\nAs a result one then has for the \u039b\u039b(\u039b\u0304\u039b\u0304) system at, or very near, its threshold\ndN/dy|S=0 \u221d 1 \u2212 0.4122y\n\nand dN/dy|S=1 \u221d 1 + 0.1374y .\n\n(26)\n\nTo note is that the l = 0, S = 1 state is forbidden by the Pauli principle. These two distinctly\ndifferent distributions, are shown in Fig. 5b. In a similar way one obtains for the \u039b\u039b system\ndN/dy|S=0 \u221d 1 + 0.4122y\n\nand\n\ndN/dy|S=1 \u221d 1 \u2212 0.1374y .\n\n(27)\n\nEven though the Wigner-Eckart theorem is applicable to the di-baryon system at Q = 0, it is\nshown in Ref. [9] that Eqs. (26) and (27) can also be applied to at Q > 0 as long as the protons\nemerging from the \u039b decays are non-relativistic. That this method can be extended even to\nhigher Q values has been pointed out in Ref. [46]. If the parameter \u01eb is defined as the fraction\nof the S = 1 contribution to the two-baryon system then it can be measured as a function of\n12\n\n\fQ by fitting the expression\ndN/dy = (1 \u2212 \u01eb) dN/dy|S=0 + \u01eb dN/dy|S=1 ,\n\n(28)\n\nto the data. In the case of a statistical spin mixture, \u01eb is equal to 0.75 which yields a constant\ndN/dy distribution. This spin analysis method has the advantage that it directly measures\nthe S =1 depletion as expected from the Pauli principle. In addition it does not require any\nreference sample which, as is well known from the BEC analyses, is the major contributor to\nthe systematic errors of the measurement (see Sec. 4.1). The main disadvantage of the direct\nspin measurement is its need for a rather large data sample. In addition, it is limited to spin\n1/2 baryons which decay weakly into hadrons and thus is not applicable, for example, to pairs\nof protons or neutrons.\n\n3.2\n\nThe phase space density approach\n\nThe probability to observe two particles, emitted from an interaction with 3-momenta k1 and\nk2 , is proportional to the square of its total wave function \u03a81,2 which is equal to the orbital\nwave function \u03c81,2 times the spin part. In the case of identical spin 1/2 baryons, the function\n\u03a81,2 should be anti-symmetric under the 1 \u2194 2 exchange. Assuming plane waves and a\ncompletely incoherent emitter (i.e. the arbitrary phases can be set to zero) the symmetric and\nthe anti-symmetric orbital wave functions are given by\ni\n1 h\ns\n\u03c81,2\n= \u221a ei(k1 r1 +k2 r2 ) + ei(k1 r2 +k2 r1 )\n2\n\nand\n\ni\n1 h\na\n\u03c81,2\n= \u221a ei(k1 r1 +k2 r2 ) \u2212 ei(k1 r2 +k2 r1 ) .\n2\n\nFrom these, as is shown in Sec. 2.1, one obtains for the symmetric orbital wave function,\napplicable to two identical hadrons\ns 2\n|\u03c81,2\n| = 1 + cos[(k1 \u2212 k2 )(r1 \u2212 r2 )] = 1 + cos(\u2206k\u2206r) ,\n\nwhereas one obtains\na 2\n|\u03c81,2\n| = 1 \u2212 cos[(k1 \u2212 k2 )(r1 \u2212 r2 )] = 1 \u2212 cos(\u2206k\u2206r) ,\n\nfor the anti-symmetric orbital wave function. If we further consider a source with a spherical\nsymmetric Gaussian density distribution [7, 8]\nf (r) \u221d e\u2212r\n\n2 /(2r 2 )\n0\n\n,\n\nthen the rate will be\n2\n\ns 2\n|\u03c81,2\n| = 1 + e\u2212r0 \u2206k\n\n2\n\nand\n\n2\n\n2\n\na 2\n|\u03c81,2\n| = 1 \u2212 e\u2212r0 \u2206k .\n\ns 2\nBecause of the Fermi-Dirac statistics the symmetric orbital part of the di-baryon system, |\u03c81,2\n|,\nis coupled to the anti-symmetric spin part, that is S = 0, whereas the anti-symmetric orbital\na 2\npart |\u03c81,2\n| is coupled to the symmetric S = 1 spin part. If we further assume that at high Q\nvalues we face a statistical spin mixture ensemble, where the probability to find a di-baryon\nin an S state is proportional to 2S + 1, we finally obtain for the emission rate, when properly\nnormalised that\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n|\u03a81,2 |2 = 0.25[1 + e\u2212r0 \u2206k + 3(1 \u2212 e\u2212r0 \u2206k )] = 1 \u2212 0.5e\u2212r0 \u2206k ,\n13\n\n\for in its Lorentz invariant form\n|\u03a81,2 (Q)|2 = 1 \u2212 0.5e\u2212r\n\n2 Q2\n\n.\n\nThus one expects at Q = 0 a reduction in the correlation function to half of its value at the\nhigh Q region provided the following conditions are satisfied:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nAt high Q values one has a statistical spin mixture ensemble;\nThe di-baryon emitter is completely incoherent;\nAbsence of resonance states at low Q values;\nFinal states interactions can be neglected.\n\nTo accommodate in this FDC analysis method (further referred to as Method II) the cases\nwhere the emitter is not completely incoherent one introduces, as in the BEC case, a chaoticity\nfactor \u03bb, that can vary between 0 and +1, so that the correlation function assumes the form\nC(Q) = N(1 \u2212 0.5\u03bbe\u2212r\n\n2 Q2\n\n),\n\n(29)\n\nwhere N represents a normalisation factor.\n\n4\n\nExperimental procedure and data analysis\n\nWell suited reactions for a BEC analysis are those which lead to multi-hadron final states where\nthe correlations due to resonances and conservation laws, like energy-momentum and charge\nbalance, have minor effects. Since in these reactions the fraction of pions is the highest one, in\nmany of the analyses one assumes that all the outgoing particles are pions and the contamination from other hadrons are accounted for by a proper correction factor and/or by an increase\nof the systematic error. The correlation study of kaon and proton pairs require special hadron\nselection criteria which tend to reduce the data statistics and introduce larger systematic errors.\nIn the BEC analysis the space density of the data hadron pairs dependence on Q is compared\nto a reference sample distribution which serves as a yardstick. The correlation function, of the\nform given in Eq. (9), is then fitted to the ratio of the data density distribution to that of\nthe reference sample. To account in the GGLP parametrisation, for the so called 'long range\ncorrelations' due e.g. to energy and momentum conservation, Eq. (9) is often modified to\ninclude linear and quadratic terms in Q, namely\nC(Q) = N(1 + \u03bbe\u2212r\n\n2 Q2\n\n)(1 + \u03b4Q + \u03b7Q2 ) ,\n\n(30)\n\nwhere \u03b4 and \u03b7 are free parameters to be determined by the fit to the data. In assessing the\nfitting results obtained for the r and \u03bb parameters one has to be aware of the fact that in\nmany cases these are not independent and a correlation between the two does exist. The weak\npart of the BEC analysis is undoubtedly the fact that it depends rather strongly on the chosen\nreference sample which thus is the main contributer to the over all systematic errors associated\nwith the fitted parameters. The different available reference samples and the effect of the final\nstate interactions on the BEC analysis results are discussed in some details in the following\nsections.\n14\n\n\f4.1\n\nChoice of the reference sample\n\nAs mentioned above the study of the second and higher order particles' BEC enhancements\nrequires a yardstick against which they can be detected and measured as is also evident from the\nC2 (k1 k2 ) definition given by Eq. (6). This yardstick is given by the so called reference sample\nthat should be identical to the analysed data in all its aspects but free from Bose-Einstein\nor Fermi-Dirac statistics effects. An ideal solution to this requirement really does not exist\nbut one has a choice of possibilities which satisfy approximately this requirement. These are\ndivided mainly into two categories. Reference samples constructed out of the data themselves\nand those supplied by Monte Carlo generated samples which are subject to a full simulation of\nthe experimental setup with its particle detection capabilities.\n4.1.1\n\nReference samples derived from the data\n\nThe methods where the reference samples are constructed from the data themselves are often\npreferred as they are expected to retain many of the kinematic and dynamical data correlations such as those originating from charge, momentum and energy conservation as well as\ncorrelations arising from hadronic resonances. In the following we will briefly describe some of\nthe data derived reference samples which, were and still are, utilised in the BEC analyses of\npion-pairs.\na) In many studies of the BEC of identical charged pion-pairs (\u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u00b1 ) the simplest reference sample is used. Namely, the one which is constructed out of the correlation of opposite\ncharged pion-pairs (\u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 ) present in the same data sample. This choice however has the following rather severe drawback. Whereas the \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u00b1 is a so called exotic system void of bosonic\nresonances, the origin of the \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 pairs may also be resonances where among them the most\ndominant one is the \u03c1(770). To overcome this deficiency the expression of the correlation function, like that given by Eq. (9), is fitted to the experimental results only in the Q regions where\nthe data is known to be free of resonances.\nb) Another frequently used reference sample is the one known under the name 'mixed-event'\nsample. In this method one couples two identical pions each originating from a different data\nevent. In this way one is guaranteed that no BEC effects will exist in the sample but at the price\nthat all other kinds of correlations, like those arising from kinematic conservation laws, are also\neliminated. Furthermore, as long as the data analysed is produced at low energies where the\nthe particles emerge to a good approximation isotropically, this event mixing procedure may be\nsatisfactory. However at higher energies where the particles emerge in hadron-jets, the mixed\nevent technique can only be applied to two-jets events where the mixing takes place between\ntwo events with a thrust (sphericity) axes lying very nearby or alternatively after one event is\nrotated so that the two events axes coincide.\nc) A third method in use for the generation of a reference sample, which avoids the need to\nrotate the event, is constructed by folding each data event along its sphericity or thrust axis so\nthat the emerging hadrons are divided into two hemispheres. The entries to the reference sample are then all possible identical pion-pairs belonging to different hemispheres. This method,\nas the former one, can only be applied to two-hadron jet events.\nFinally to note is that the choice of data derived reference samples for a BEC analysis\n15\n\n\fof kaon-pairs or for a FDC Method II analysis of baryon-pairs is much more restricted. For\nexample, in the BEC analyses of K \u00b1 K \u00b1 or KS0 KS0 pairs the data K \u00b1 K \u2213 pairs cannot be used\ndue to the strong presence of the \u03c6(1020) \u2192 K \u00b1 K \u2213 decay which lies at the very low Q range\nwhere the BEC interference is near its maximum.\n4.1.2\n\nMonte Carlo generated reference samples\n\nModelling of the hadron production in particle reaction plays a central role in any experimental\ndata analysis in high energy physics. Its aim is mainly the evaluation of the various experimental deficiencies due to the imperfection of the detection system such as the geometrical\nacceptance, angular resolution and separation of tracks as well as the limited particle identification capabilities. In addition, the hadron production simulation serves as a yardstick against\nwhich various physics phenomena and hypotheses can be detected and measured. In this last\ncapacity modelling of hadron production is also used extensively in the study of particle correlations.\n\nFigure 6: A schematic diagram for the production of hadrons in e+ e\u2212 annihilation.\nTo illustrate the hadronisation process we show in Fig. 6 a schematic diagram for the production of hadrons in the process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Z 0 /\u03b3 \u22c6 \u2192 q q\u0304. The q q\u0304, which is not directly detected,\nresults in a relative large number of hadrons. This final step process is governed by the strong\ninteractions and can be divided into two parts. Firstly a parton cascade develops in which the\nq and q\u0304 pair radiates gluons, which in turn may radiate additional gluons and split into new\nq q\u0304 pairs. This process is followed by the hadronisation stage which emits the final observed\nparticles. These two last stages are described in the standard model of particles and fields in\nterms of the Quantum Chromo Dynamics (QCD) theory where the force field between partons\nis the so called colour field.\nAt short distances and over short times the quarks and gluons can be considered as free\nparticles where the perturbative QCD can be applied. This is not the case at the hadronisation\nstage where there is a need to rely on non-perturbative QCD models. One of the leading successful models, which currently is applied to many of the high energy particle reactions leading\nto hadronic final states, is the Lund string fragmentation model [47], shown schematically in\n16\n\n\fFig. 7. In this Lund model the probability |M(q q\u0304 \u2192 h1 ....hn )|2 to emit n-hadrons is proportional e\u2212bA where A is the colour field area spanned in time-space by the primary q q\u0304 pair and\nb is a real positive constant.\nIn the simplest case where the q and q\u0304 emerge in opposite directions, the colour field spanned\nbetween them is approximated by a massless relativistic string with constant energy density.\nrank 1if given\nrank 3 by collision enough energy the string will\nThese quarks oscillate back and hadron\nforth and\np\n1.9\n2.9\ntear and a new pair of quarks will\u0003s be produced.\n1.9\n2.9 This process repeats itself until only ordinary\n\u0003c the produced\n2.6\n(onlyhadrons\ncreated asare\nrankgiven\n1)\nhadrons will remain.

To note is that the production of quark pairs with mq > 0\ncosts energy which is taken from the constant energy density string which means that they\nTable 3: h ithe\nfor light baryons\nand h efbut\nf i for heavy baryons.

The success of the Lund model stems not only from its ability to describe many\nof the high energy interaction features but also from the fact that it can be formulated stochastically as an iterative process and therefore is well suited for computer Monte Carlo simulation\nprograms like the JETSET and its more recent advanced versions.\n\nq1\n\nq1\nq2\n\nq2\n\nA\nq\n\nq\n\nt\nx\n\nFigure 1: String fragmentation in x-t space.\nFigure 7: The hadronic decay\nof a Lund model string spanning the time-space area A.\n\nAnother approach to the hadronisation has been taken by the cluster model [48]. This\nmodel is based on the observation that partons generated in a branching process tend to be\narranged in colour singlet clusters formed from q q\u0304 pairs with limited extension in coordinate\nand momentum space. These clusters have masses\n16 typically of the energy scale at which the\nparton shower terminates. Very massive clusters decay first into lighter clusters pairs and then\neach cluster decays isotropically into observable hadron pairs with branching ratio determined\nby the density of states. This model is implemented in the HERWIG Monte Carlo program\nready to be used in the experimental analyses.\nAt this point it is important to note that although outgoing particle tracks generated in the\nMonte Carlo programs do have a charge ascription their Coulomb effects are not included. In\naddition, all generated particles are spinless. In the Lund model derived Monte Carlo versions\na facility has been added so that the Bose-Einstein statistics effects present in identical boson\n17\n\n\fsystem can be incorporated [49]. Another deficiency of the Monte Carlo programs is the need\nto adjust quite a few free parameters, like the ratio between vector and scalar resonances and\ntheir production cross sections, to the experimental findings. As a consequence, one should\nproceed with caution when comparing a particular effect seen in the data with the Monte Carlo\nprogram prediction. Moreover, the setting of the many free parameters may well interfere with\nthe possibility to test the validity of the assumptions and underlying building elements of the\nparticular hadronisation model.\n\n4.2\n\nFinal state interactions\n\nIn the BEC and FDC analyses, final state interactions (FSI) may also play a role. There are\ntwo major FSI types. The first is the Coulomb interaction which affects the charged hadron\nsystems and the second, the strong interaction final state which is present in both charged\nand neutral hadron systems. So far many of the reported BEC analyses have included the\nCoulomb effect whereas the strong final state interactions have in general been avoided due to\ntheir complexity and the realisation that their effect on the \u03bb and r parameters is relatively\nsmall and can be absorbed in the overall systematic errors (see Sec. 4.2.2).\n4.2.1\n\nThe Coulomb effect\n\nIn the Bose-Einstein correlation of identical charged hadrons the Coulomb repulsive force tends\nto reduce the enhancement signal. If C2meas (Q) denotes the measured correlation of two hadrons\nthen its relation to the true correlation C2 (Q) is given by\nC2meas (Q) = C2 (Q) \u00d7 G2 (Q) ,\n\n(31)\n\nwhere G2 (Q) is determined through the Gamow penetration factor [50]\nG2 (Q) =\n\n2\u03c0\u03b71,2\n\u2212 1\n\ne2\u03c0\u03b71,2\n\nwhere\n\n\u03b71,2 = \u01eb1 \u01eb2\n\n\u03b1m\n.\nQ\n\n(32)\n\nHere \u01ebi are the charges in positron units of the hadrons, m their mass and \u03b1 is the finestructure constant. As seen from Eq. (32), the Coulomb effect increases as Q approaches zero.\nThe measured correlation is corrected by the factor 1/G2 (Q) which may produce an exaggerated\nBEC signal [51] and therefore proper caution has to be exercised in its application. A somewhat\ndifferent Coulomb correction method has been advocated in [52]. To note is that the Coulomb\ncorrection for a di-pion system is rather small (see Fig. 8) and even at Q2 = 0.2 GeV does\nnot amount to more than 2% and therefore in many reported BEC studies this correction was\nignored.\nThe Coulomb effect on the BEC analysis of three identical charged hadrons can be expressed\n[54], to a good approximation, in terms of two-hadron Coulomb factors as\nG3 (Q3 ) = G2 (Q1,2 ) \u00d7 G2 (Q1,3 ) \u00d7 G2 (Q2,3 ) .\n\n(33)\n\nFurther improvements to Eq. (33) have been proposed (see e.g. Refs. [55, 56]). Unlike the\ndi-pion case the Coulomb correction for three equally charged pions at Q3 = 0.25 GeV is not\nnegligible and, as seen in Fig. 8, amounts to about 7%.\n18\n\n\f1.08\n\n1/G 3(Q 3)\n\n1/G 2 (Q 2)\n\n1.08\n\n(a)\n\n1.06\n1.04\n\n1.04\n\n1.02\n\n1.02\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.98\n\n0.98\n\n0.96\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n(b)\n\n1.06\n\n2\n\n0.96\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nQ 3 (GeV)\n\nQ2 (GeV)\n\nFigure 8: The Coulomb correction to the BEC correlation function [53].

[17]\nwhere references to earlier studies are also included. The FSI of the strong type are limited,\ndue to the short range of strong interaction, to the s-wave alone. For the \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u00b1 system the\n(2)\nFSI dependence on Q is given by the well measured I\u03c0\u03c0 = 2 phase shift \u03b40 (Q) which can be\nincorporated into the BEC function.\nAn example for the inclusion of FSI in a BEC analysis Ref. [17] is illustrated in Fig. 3. In\nthis figure the data points shown are the \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u00b1 correlation function versus Q as measured by\nthe OPAL collaboration [15] in the hadronic Z 0 decays. The solid line represents the fit results\nto the BEC function including Coulomb and strong FSI whereas the dashed line is the outcome\nof a fit where the FSI were ignored. In a systematic study of the FSI in several BEC analyses\napplied to e+ e\u2212 \u2192 pions data collected at energies on the Z 0 mass and below, it was found\nthat in general the inclusion of the FSI tends to increase \u03bb and decrease the r value [17].\n\n5\n5.1\n\nThe 1-Dimensional correlation results\nThe \u03c0\u03c0 Bose-Einstein correlation\n\nThe major information concerning the BEC features is coming from the \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u00b1 system which\nhas been analysed in a large variety of particle reactions and over a wide range of centre of\nmass energies. In Table 1 results obtained from the 1-dimensional BEC analyses of two identical pions produced in e+ e\u2212 annihilation in the energy range from 29 to 91 GeV are listed.\nThe values for r2 and \u03bb2 are divided into two groups according to the reference sample type\nthat was used. In Method I the reference sample chosen was the data \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 system whereas\nin Method II the reference sample used was either a generated Monte Carlo sample plus a full\n19\n\n\fTable 1: The two-pion GGLP emitter dimension r2 and the chaoticity parameter \u03bb2 deduced from\nBEC studies of e+ e\u2212 annihilations using one or two choices for the reference sample. In Method I\nthe reference sample was the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 data sample.

Firstly the values of r2 are in general found to be higher in the Method I analysis than\nin the Method II analysis whereas the \u03bb2 values are roughly the same. Secondly there is no\nclear evidence for an r dependence on the centre of mass energy. To note is also the fact that\nthe values of r2 are smaller than 1 fm and their average in Method I is in the vicinity of 0.8\nfm. In Method II the r values are less stable and fluctuate from experiment to experiment. It\nis generally believed that these fluctuations of the r values are just a reflection of the fact that\ndifferent experiments used different BEC analysis procedures, namely in their data selection\ncriteria and in their choice of the reference sample. This situation is also clearly seen in Fig.\n9 where r2 is plotted against the e+ e\u2212 centre of mass energy, Ecm . In particular to note are\nthe three r2 values obtained in Method I for the \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u00b1 pairs emitted from the Z 0 gauge boson\nwhere the OPAL value differs by several standard deviations from those reported by ALEPH\nand DELPHI. The L3 collaboration has not given an r value in the framework of the Method\nI analysis. Unlike the abundant results on the \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u00b1 correlations the information on the BEC\nanalyses of \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 pairs is very limited due to the experimental difficulties in identifying the\ntwo neutral bosons. At the same time there exists an interest in the two neutral pion system both in the framework of the string model and in the so called generalised BEC where\nisospin invariance is incorporated into the analysis. The two r values, obtained from the BEC\nanalysis of the \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 system, present in the hadronic Z 0 decay and listed in Table 1, do not\n20\n\n\fRadius (fm)\n\n2.5\n2.25\n\ne e \u2192 hadrons\n+ -\n\n\u274d MARKII\n\u274f TASSO\n\u25bc TPC\n\u25a0 AMY\n\u2206 ALEPH\n\u25cf DELPHI\n\u25b2 L3\n\u272d OPAL\n\n2\n1.75\n1.5\n1.25\n1\n0.75\n0.5\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nEcm (GeV)\n\nFigure 9: The emitter dimension r\u03c0\u00b1 \u03c0\u00b1 obtained from BEC analyses of e+ e\u2212 annihilation into hadrons\n\nversus the centre of mass energy of the e+ e\u2212 system. The values were taken from references [22, 24,\n57\u201362] where all but TPC and L3 used a data reference sample (see also Table 1).\n\nallow presently a meaningful comparison to the string model and isospin invariance predictions.\nA compilation of \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u00b1 BEC parameters obtained from analyses carried out in a variety of\nparticle reactions, other than e+ e\u2212 annihilation, is given in Table 2. Again no clear evidence\ncan been seen for an r2 dependence on the type of reaction and/or energy. The r values reported are, like in e+ e\u2212 annihilations, again near, or somewhat lower, than 1 fm.\nThe BEC of the \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u00b1 pairs produced in the reaction e+ e\u2212 \u2192 W + W \u2212 \u2192 hadrons, where\nthe pions are emerging from different W bosons, have been recently investigated in view of\nthe concern that they might affect the W gauge boson mass estimation [75]. Whereas the\npreliminary results of DELPHI found some evidence for a BEC enhancement [76], the L3 and\nALEPH collaborations have not seen any effect of this kind [77, 78].\n\n5.2\n\nThe K \u00b1K \u00b1 and KS0 KS0 systems\n\nThe results from BEC analyses of the K \u00b1 K \u00b1 system are meager in comparison to those reported from the \u03c0\u03c0 BEC analyses. This is mainly due to the fact that the rate of the charged\nkaons is much smaller than that of the charged pions which even in the hadronic Z 0 decays\namounts only to \u2243 2.4/17. An additional reason for the relatively poor kaon-pairs statistics\nstems from the need to remove from their sample contributions from protons, anti-protons and\ncharged pions. This is achieved by applying hadron identification criteria which in most cases\nare effective only in a limited range of momentum. In the e+ e\u2212 annihilations on the Z 0 mass\nenergy two K \u00b1 K \u00b1 BEC analyses have been reported [79, 80]. Their extracted rK \u00b1 K \u00b1 values\nare listed in Table 4.\n21\n\n\fTable 2: A representative sample of the two-pion emitter dimension r and the chaoticity parameter \u03bb2\ndeduced from BEC studies of hadron-hadron, lepton-hadron and \u03b3\u03b3 reactions leading to multi-hadron\nfinal states. The data selection and reference samples, as well as the application of the Coulomb\ncorrection, differ from experiment to experiment. In most cases the errors given are only the statistical\nones. The systematic errors are typically of the order of 10 to 20% of the measured parameter values.\n\n\u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u00b1 BEC analyses\nReaction\nECM [GeV]\n\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 h\n\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 6\u03c0 \u00b1\n\u03bd(\u03bd\u0304)N \u2192 h\n\u03bcp \u2192 h\n\u03c0+p \u2192 h\npp \u2192 h\npp \u2192 h\npp \u2192 h\npp \u2192 h\npp \u2192 h\nep\u2192eh\nep\u2192eh\n\n[24]\n[65]\n[66]\n[67]\n[68]\n[69]\n[70]\n[71]\n[72]\n[73]\n\n<5>\n1.6 \u2212 7.5\n8 \u2212 64\n23\n21.7\n26\n27.4\n63\n1.88\n200 - 900\n\n[74]\n[16]\n\n6 < Q2\u03b3 < 100 [GeV2 ]\n110 < Q2\u03b3 [GeV2 ]\n\nParameter\nr2 [fm]\n\u03bb2\n1.05\n0.54\n0.64\n0.65\n0.83\n1.02\n1.20\n0.82\n1.04\n0.73\n\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\n0.08\n0.22\n0.16\n0.03\n0.06\n0.20\n0.03\n0.05\n0.01\n0.03\n\n1.20\n0.59\n0.46\n0.80\n0.33\n0.32\n0.44\n0.40\n1.96\n0.25\n\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\n0.13\n0.20\n0.16\n0.07\n0.02\n0.08\n0.01\n0.03\n0.03\n0.02\n\n0.68 \u00b1 0.06 0.52 \u00b1 0.20\n0.67 \u00b1 0.04 0.43 \u00b1 0.09\n\nUnlike the K \u00b1 K \u00b1 pairs, the origin of the KS0 KS0 system is not only fed from strangeness\n0\n\u00b12 states but also from the boson-antiboson K 0 K (strangeness = 0) system which in turn\nmay be fed from the decay of resonances. Neglecting CP violation1 we show in the following\nthat a Bose-Einstein like threshold enhancement is nevertheless expected in the Q(KS0 , KS0 )\n0\ndistribution even when its origin is the K 0 K system [81\u201384].\nIn general a boson-antiboson, BB, pair is an eigenstate of the charge conjugation operator\nC. In the absence of outside constraints, one can write the probability amplitude for a given\ncharge conjugation eigenvalue Cn as follows:\nE\nE\nE\n1\n1\n1\n\u221a B; B\nB(p); B(\u2212p) \u00b1\nB(p); B(\u2212p) ,\n=\nCn =\u00b11\n2\n2\n2\n\n(34)\n\nwhere p is the three momentum vector defined in the BB centre of mass system. In the Q = 0\nlimit, where the BEC effect should be maximal, p is equal to zero and Eq. (34) reads\nE\nE\nE\n1\n1\n1\n\u221a B; B\nB(0); B(0) \u00b1\nB(0); B(0) .\n=\nCn =\u00b11\n2\n2\n2\n\n(35)\n\nThis means that, at Q = 0, the probability amplitude for the Cn = \u22121 state (odd l values) is\nzero whereas the Cn = +1 state (even l values) is maximal. Here it is important to note that\n1\n\nThe inclusion of CP violation effect in the following discussion is straightforward but with negligible consequences at the current experimental precision level.\n\n22\n\n\f0\n\nthese equations do hold for any spinless boson-antiboson pair such the K 0 K , the K + K \u2212 and\n0\nthe \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 systems. What does distinguish the K 0 K from the other spinless boson-antiboson\npairs is the simplicity by which one is able to project out the Cn = +1 and the Cn = \u22121 parts\nof the probability amplitude.\n0\n\nAs is well known, the K 0 and the K mesons are described in terms of the two CP eigen0\nstates, KS0 with CPn = +1 and KL0 with CPn = \u22121. From this follows that, when the K 0 K\n0\npair is detected through their KS0 and KL0 decays, a definite eigenvalue Cn of the K 0 K system can be selected. Thus, as Q approaches zero, an enhancement should be observed in the\nprobability to detect KS0 KS0 pairs and/or KL0 KL0 pairs (Cn = +1), whereas a decrease should\nbe seen in the probability to find KS0 KL0 pairs (Cn = \u22121). The BEC can thus be analysed by\nforming for the eigenstate Cn = +1 and Cn = \u22121 respectively the correlation functions:\nC+ (Q) =\n\n2P (KS0 KS0 ) + 2P (KL0 KL0 )\n\nand\n\n0\n\nP (K 0 K )\n\nC\u2212 (Q) =\n\n2P (KS0 KL0 ) + 2P (KL0 KS0 )\n0\n\nP (K 0 K )\n\n, (36)\n\nwhere P stands for the production rate of a given two-boson state as a function of Q.\n\nC (Q)\n\nThese C+ (Q) and C\u2212 (Q) dependence on Q, for \u03bb = 1, are drawn schematically in Fig. 10.\nAs seen, when Q approaches zero, C(Q) splits into two branches. The first rises up to the value\ntwo and the other decreases to zero in such a way that their sum remains constant and equal\n0\nto one at all Q values. This means, that if all the decay modes of the K 0 K pairs are detected\nand used simultaneously in the same correlation analysis then, according to Eqs. (34) and (35),\nno BEC effect will be observed at Q = 0. This however should not come as a surprise if one\n0\nrecalls that the K 0 K system is at the very end not composed of two identical bosons.\n2\n\n1.8\n1.6\n\n=\nCn\ne\n\nv\nwa\n\n1.2\n\n+1\n\nen\n\nev\n\n1.4\n\nav\n\ne\n\n1\n\n\u22121\n\nC\n\nn\n\n0.6\n\n=\n\nod\n\ndw\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n0\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9\n\n1\n\nQ (Arbitrary Units)\n0\n\nFigure 10: Schematic behaviour of the correlation functions C(Q) of the K 0 K system given by\nEq.

The sum of Cn = +1 and Cn = \u22121 remains\nconstant down to Q = 0.\n\nThe interpretation of a BEC enhancement in the KS0 KS0 system is not straightforward as\n23\n\n\fits origin may also be the decay of the scalar f0 (980) resonance. This resonance, which is\nmainly observed in its decay to pion-pair in the decay of the Z 0 gauge boson [85], lies within its\n0\nwidth at the K 0 K threshold of 995.3 MeV. Thus the low Q enhancement seen in the KS0 KS0\ncorrelation at Q \u223c 0 may be formed from the Bose-Einstein effect and/or from the f0 (980)\nresonance decay. A possible method to disentangle the two contributions is given by isospin\nconsiderations [86] which is outlined in the following section. Values for \u03bb and r obtained for\nthe KS0 KS0 system, produced in e+ e\u2212 annihilation on the Z 0 mass, are given in Table 4.\n\n5.3\n\nIsospin invariance and generalised Bose-Einstein correlation\n\nIn the sector of strong interacting hadrons where BEC and FDC analyses are performed, the\nisospin is a conserved quantity. In analogue to the so called generalised Pauli principle, which\nis the extension of that principle from two identical nucleons, the proton-proton and neutronneutron pairs, to the proton-neutron system, one can generalise the Bose-Einstein statistics by\nthe inclusion of the isospin invariance. This extension may relate for example, BEC results\nof the \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u00b1 pairs to those obtained for the \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 system. This extension was pointed out by\nseveral authors (see e.g. references [13, 87\u201389]) and recently was worked out in details [86] to\nproduce concrete relations between the BEC effects of hadron systems which are connected\nby isospin and are proposed to be tested experimentally. So far however the concept of the\ngeneralised BEC has not been verified as it involves pion systems which include one or more\nneutral pions which experimentally are hard to detect and identify. However if the generalised BEC assumption is confirmed then its effect on particles correlations is not negligible. In\nthe following we briefly discuss some aspects of the generalised BEC features and consequences.\nFirst to note is that in many cases boson pairs, like the KK and \u03c0\u03c0 systems, are produced\ntogether with other hadrons, here denoted by X, from an initial state which is isoscalar to a\nvery good approximation. These include e.g. pairs produced from an initial multi-gluon state,\npairs from hadronic decays of J/\u03c8 and \u03a5, or pairs produced by Z 0 decays. In some of these\ncases the initial state is however not pure I=0 but has also some contamination of an I=1\ncomponent which is mixed in like in those processes where the J/\u03c8 and \u03a5 decay to hadrons\nvia one photon annihilation. According to the specific case methods can be applied to reduce,\nor even eliminate, this contamination. For example, the subsample of the Cn = \u22121 quarkonia\nwhich decays into an odd number of pions assures, due to G-parity, that the hadronic final\nstate is in an I=0 state. Forming such a subsample from the hadronic Z 0 decays is not useful,\nbut on the other hand multi-hadron final states which originate from Z 0 decays into ss\u0304, cc\u0304 and\nbb\u0304 quark pairs, are in an I=0 state.\nSeveral specific relations in the framework of the generalised Bose-Einstein statistics between charge and neutral K-mesons have been proposed in reference [86]. Among others, of\na particular interest are those relations which have a bearing on the analysis of the enigmatic\nscalar f0 (980) resonance, whose mass and width lie in the KK threshold region, and which has\na long history regarding its nature and decay modes [43, 90\u201392]. For details concerning these\nrelations the reader is advised to turn to reference [86].\nNext we turn to the effect of the generalised BEC assumption on the \u03c0\u03c0 system. In this\nsystem there are more states and more isospin amplitudes than the two, I=0 and I=1 of the\nKK system. In the low Q region where only the s-wave contributes, the \u03c0 + \u03c0 + , \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0\n24\n\n\famplitudes depend upon only two isospin amplitudes, I=0 and I=2. Their intensities in this\nregion satisfy a triangular inequality [86]\nX q\n\n(2/3) * P [io \u2192 (\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 )X] \u2212\n\nX\n\n\u2264\n\n\u2264\n\nXq\nX\n\nX q\nX\n\nP [io \u2192 (\u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u00b1 )X] =\n\n(2/3) * P [io \u2192\n\n(\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 )X]\n\nq\n\n(1/3) * P [io \u2192 (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )e X] \u2264\n\nXq\n\n+\n\nX\nq\n\nP [io \u2192 (\u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 0 )e X] \u2264\n\n(1/3) * P [io \u2192 (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )e X]\n\n,\n\n(37)\n\nwhere the notation (\u03c0\u03c0)e is used to indicate that only even partial waves for the (\u03c0\u03c0) final state\nare included in the sum. Here io denotes an initial I=0 state and X stands for the hadrons\nproduced in association with the two earmarked pion-pair.\nIn this last relation the middle line is of a particular interest as it states that at low Q\nvalues, where only the s-wave survives, the BEC enhancement in the \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 0 system should be\nequal to that present in the \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u00b1 pairs. Finally the BEC features of the \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 system should\nnot be far from that of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 + state as long as the contribution of the \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 to the triangle\ninequality relation remains small.\n\n5.4\n\nObservation of higher order Bose-Einstein correlations\n\nAs mentioned in Sec. 2.3, the directly measured higher order BEC are essentially limited to the\ncase of three identical charged pions. In these analyses, the contribution from the two-hadron\nBEC was subtracted in each experiment with somewhat different method. The genuine \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u00b1\nBEC were also measured in the reaction e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Z 0 followed by an hadronic decay [93\u201395].\nThe experimental normalised distribution, which is marked by (a) in Fig. 11, is that found by\nOPAL [94] to describe the contribution to R3 (Q3 ), as defined in Eq. (17), from the over-all\nthree identical charged pion BEC enhancement. In the same figure the three-pion distribution,\ndenoted by (b), corresponds to the BEC enhancement due to the lower order BEC correlations\ni.e. the two-pion system. A clear evidence is seen for the genuine three-pion BEC enhancement\nwhich can be extracted by subtracting the distribution (b) from that of (a) which then allows\nthe evaluation of r3 .\nResults for the three-boson emitter dimension are listed in Table 3 where the values of r3\nand the ratio r3 /r2 are given. As can be seen, it does not seem to exist a significant dependence\nof the r3 and r3 /r2 values on the type and/or energy of the particles reaction.\nIn Ref. [24] a relation is derived between the two-pion emitter radius r2 and the three-pion\nemitter radius r3 as extracted from a fit of R3 (Q3 ) to the over-all (non-genuine) three-boson\ncorrelation distribution. This relation, which is based on the Fourier transform of a Gaussian\nshape hadron source, is given by the inequality\n\u221a\n\u221a\nr2 / 3 \u2264 r3 \u2264 r2 / 2 .\n(38)\nso that r3 /r2 , lies in the range of 0.55 to 0.71.

The over-all normalised BEC enhancement is described by the (a) distribution whereas\ndistribution (b) corresponds to the three-pion BEC enhancement generated from the lower order BEC\nenhancement of the two-pion system.\nwhen the emitter radius r3 is determined from the genuine BEC distribution parametrised by\nC3 (Q3 ) so that r3 /r2 should exactly be equal to 0.71. The experimental results, shown in Table\n3, are seen to fulfil the expected relations between r2 and r3 and in particular the results from\nthe genuine three-pion correlation obtained from the hadronic Z 0 decay are consistent within\none to two standard deviations with the expectation of Eq. (39).\n\n5.5\n\nExperimental results from Fermi-Dirac correlation analyses\n\nUntil recently FDC analyses of fermion-pairs were prohibited due to the low production rate\nof identical di-baryons in particle reactions at low and intermediate energies. This situation\nchanged with the commission of the LEP collider, operating on the Z 0 mass energy, where\neach of its four experiments have accumulated some 3 to 4 million hadronic Z 0 decays. The\ninclusive Z 0 decay branching ratio of \u223c0.34 \u039b per event was sufficiently high to allow a FDC\nanalysis of the \u039b \u039b(\u039b \u039b) and \u039b \u039b pairs which are free of Coulomb effects and are relatively easy\nidentified. Results from these analyses have been reported by the OPAL [98], DELPHI [99] and\nALEPH [100] collaborations using the spin-spin correlation method (see Fig. 12). The ALEPH\ncollaboration has further repeated its analysis with Method II, i.e. with the phase space density\napproach and found the results of both methods to be consistent within errors (see Fig. 13).\nIn the same figure is also shown the OPAL [101] recent p p FDC measurement carried out in\nthe hadronic Z 0 decays.\nA summary of the measured di-baryon r values is given in Table 4 together with the average\nLEP1 value for the \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u00b1 pairs and values for the K \u00b1 K \u00b1 and KS0 KS0 systems obtained from\nBEC analyses. To note is the fact, as already discussed in Sec. 5.2, that the KS0 KS0 pairs\nmay also be the decay product of resonances like the f0 (980), whereas the other hadron pairs\nlisted in the Table form, so called, exotic states, that is they are in isospin 2 or strangeness \u00b12\n26\n\n\fTable 3: Results for r3 and r3 /r2 values obtained from BEC analyses of two and three identical\ncharged pions.

The most striking feature that emerges\nfrom the measured data listed in Table 4 is the very small r values obtained for the identical\ndi-baryon systems which lie in the vicinity of \u223c0.15 fm, way below the values obtained for the\nmesons and also much smaller than the proton charge and nuclear radius [105] of \u223c 0.83 \u00b1 0.02\nfm. Finally the fact that the data in Table 4 utilised the same reaction at the same centre of\nmass energy, affords a unique opportunity to study the emitter dimension r as a function of\nthe hadron mass. This feature is dealt with in the following sections.\n\n6\n\nThe r dependence on the hadron mass\n\nThe r2 dependence on the hadron mass, r(m), shown in Fig. 14, exhibits a relatively strong\ndecrease in r as the hadron mass increases, a feature which however currently rests mainly\non the results obtained for the baryon-pairs. The possibility that the origin of this behaviour\narises from purely kinematic considerations has been explored in Ref. [106] with the conclusion\nthat this by itself cannot account for the rather sharp decrease of r2 with m. Thus this r2\ndependence on the hadron mass has to be faced by all non-perturbative QCD models which\nattempt to describe the hadron production process. In particular r(m) poses a challenge to the\nstring approach which also constitutes a basis for the Lund model of hadronisation described in\ndetails in [47], which expects that \u2202r/\u2202m > 0 in its rudimental form. Whereas the somewhat\nsmaller value of r(mK ) as compared to that of r(m\u03c0 ), may still be acceptable, the very small\nr2 values extracted from the \u039b and proton pairs cannot apparently be accommodated within\nthe Lund string approach [107].\n27\n\n\f\u2212 \u2212\n\n\u2212\n\nEntries / 0.2\n\n\u039b\u039b,\u039b\u039b\n\n\u039b\u039b\n\n200\n\n2000\n\n150\n\n1500\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n50\n\n500\n\n0.0 GeV < Q < 1.5 GeV\n\n0\n200\n\n0\n1000\n\n150\n\n750\n\n100\n\n500\n\n50\n\n250\n\n1.5 GeV < Q < 2.0 GeV\n\n0\n\n0\n\n600\n\n1500\n\n400\n\n1000\n\n200\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n1.5 GeV < Q < 2.0 GeV\n\n500\n\n2.0 GeV < Q < 4.0 GeV\n-1\n\n0.0 GeV < Q < 1.5 GeV\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2.0 GeV < Q < 4.0 GeV\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\ny\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\ny\n\nFigure 12: The ALEPH results from the spin-spin FDC analysis of the \u039b\u039b and \u039b\u039b pairs observed in\nthe hadronic Z 0 decays [100] given at several Q regions and presented in terms of dN/dy where y is\nthe cosine angle between the two decay protons. The lines represent the best fit of Eq. (28) to the\ndata.\n\n6.1\n\nThe r(m) description in terms of the Heisenberg relations\n\nThe maximum of the BEC and FDC effects, from which the dimension r is deduced, occurs\nwhen the Q value of the two identical hadrons of mass m approaches zero i.e., the hadrons are\nalmost at rest in their CMS which also means that the three vector momentum difference \u2206p\napproaches zero. This motivated the attempt to link the r(m) behaviour to the Heisenberg\nuncertainty principle [102]. From these uncertainty relations one has that\n\u2206p \u2206r = 2 \u03bc v r = m v r = h\u0304 c ,\n\n(40)\n\nwhere m and v are the hadron mass and its velocity. Here \u03bc is the reduced mass of the dihadron system and r is the geometrical distance between them. The momentum difference \u2206p\nis measured in GeV and r \u2261 \u2206r is given in Fermi units while h\u0304c = 0.197 GeV fm.

This r dependence on m is shown in Fig. 14\nby the thin solid line. The sensitivity of r(m) to the value of \u2206t is represented by the dashed\nlines in the same figure. The upper and the lower dashed lines correspond respectively to the\nvalues of \u2206t = 1.5 \u00d7 10\u221224 and 0.5 \u00d7 10\u221224 seconds. A fit of Eq. (44) to the data points plotted\nin Fig. 14 yields \u2206t = (1.2 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 10\u221224 seconds where 0.3 represents the statistical error.\nAs seen in the figure, the dependence of r on the mass m, as determined from the Heisenberg\nrelations, follows within errors the measured values and thus offers a natural explanation for\nthe experimental found hierarchy r\u03c0\u03c0 > rKK > rpp \u223c r\u039b\u039b .\n\n6.2\n\nQCD description of r(m) via the virial theorem\n\nIn the previous section it has been shown that the observed hierarchy \u2202r/\u2202m < 0 has a\nnatural and a rather general explanation. Here we would like to demonstrate that such a\ndependence could shed light on the character of the \"soft\" interaction or, in other words, on\nthe non-perturbative QCD which is responsible for the interaction at long distances. In that\nwe follow [102] and use the semi-classical approximation as in Sec. 6.1, which means that the\nangular momentum is given by\nl = | ~p1 \u2212 p~2 | bt = 2 p bt \u2248 h\u0304 c ,\n29\n\n(45)\n\n\fTable 4: Experimental results for r and \u03bb extracted from Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac correlations\nof boson and baryon-pairs present in the hadronic Z 0 decays produced in e+ e\u2212 annihilations in the\nLEP1 collider.\nhh\n\n\u03bb2\n\nr2 [fm]\n\n\u03c0\u00b1 \u03c0\u00b1\n\n\u2212\n\n0.78 \u00b1 0.01 \u00b1 0.16\n\nK\u00b1 K\u00b1\nKS0 KS0\n\npp\n\u039b\u039b\n\u039b\u039b\n\n0.82 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b1 0.25\n0.82 \u00b1 0.22 +0.17\n\u22120.12\n1.14 \u00b1 0.23 \u00b1 0.32\n0.96 \u00b1 0.21 \u00b1 0.40\n0.61 \u00b1 0.16 \u00b1 0.16\n\u2212\n\u2212\nSpin Analysis\n\"\n\"\n\n0.48 \u00b1 0.04 \u00b1 0.07\n0.56 \u00b1 0.08 +0.07\n\u22120.06\n0.76 \u00b1 0.10 \u00b1 0.11\n0.65 \u00b1 0.07 \u00b1 0.15\n0.55 \u00b1 0.08 \u00b1 0.12\n0.15 \u00b1 0.02 \u00b1 0.04\n0.11 \u00b1 0.02 \u00b1 0.01\n0.19 +0.37\n\u22120.07 \u00b1 0.02\n0.11 +0.05\n\u22120.03 \u00b1 0.01\n0.17 \u00b1 0.13 \u00b1 0.04\n\nExperiment\nLEP1 Average\n\n[102]\n\nDELPHI\n\n[79]\n[80]\n[103]\n[104]\n[79]\n[101]\n[100]\n\nOPAL\nOPAL\nALEPH\nDELPHI\nOPAL\nALEPH\nOPAL\nDELPHI\nALEPH\n\n[98]\n[99]\n[100]\n\nwhere bt is the impact parameter. To estimate the value of p one uses the virial theorem [108]\nwhich provides a general connection between the average values of the kinetic and the potential\nenergies (T and V), namely\n~ t V (r) i ,\n2 h Tt i = h ~bt * \u2207\n(46)\nwhere t denotes the transverse direction. Since the motion in the transverse direction is always\nfinite, one can safely apply the virial theorem. Substituting in Eq. (46) the kinetic energy by\nits relation to the momentum, Tt = p2t /m, we obtain\n~ t V (r) i ,\nh p2t i = m h ~rt * \u2207\n\n(47)\n\nwhere r stands for the distance between the two particles with rt being equal to 2bt .\nFrom Eq. (47) follows that the relation between hp2 i and r depends crucially on the r\ndependence of the potential energy V (r). Here we take V (r) to be independent of the interacting\nparticles (quarks) mass. This assumption is based on the Local Parton Hadron Duality [109,110]\nconcept, which states that one can consider the production of hadron as interaction of partons,\ni.e. gluons and quarks, in spite of the unknown mechanism of hadronisation. This approach\nis supported experimentally by the single and double inclusive hadron production in e+ e\u2212\nannihilation [109, 110]. Since the interaction between partons is independent of the produced\nhadron mass it follows that \u2202V (r)/\u2202m = 0. Based on this assumption and using Eq. (45) and\nEq. (46), one obtains an equation for the typical size of the emission volume, namely\n2\n~ V (r) i \u2248 ( h\u0304 c ) .\nr 2 h ~r * \u2207\nm\nFurther one applies to Eq.

For clarity the data points are plotted at slightly\ndisplaced mass values. The error bars correspond to the statistical and systematic errors added in\nquadrature. The thin solid line represents the expectation from the Heisenberg uncertainty relations\nsetting \u2206t = 10\u221224 seconds [102]. The upper and the lower dashed lines correspond to \u2206t = 1.5\u00d710\u221224\nand 0.5\u00d710\u221224 seconds respectively. The thick solid line represents the dependence of r2 on the hadron\nmass as expected from a QCD potential given by Eq. (49).\n\nwidely used to derive the wave functions and decay constants of hadrons [111, 112]. Setting\nthe potential parameters values to \u03ba = 0.14 GeV2 = 0.70 GeV/fm , \u03b1s = 2\u03c0/9 ln(\u03b4 + \u03b3/r)\nwith \u03b4 = 2 and \u03b3 = 1.87 GeV\u22121 = 0.37 fm as derived from hadron wave functions and decay\nconstants [111], the resulting dependence of r on the hadron mass, given by the solid thick\nline in Fig. 14, is seen to follow rather well the the data. Moreover, this QCD expectation\nessentially coincides with the prediction derived from the Heisenberg uncertainty relations (thin\nsolid line in the same figure).\n\n7\n\nResults from multi-dimensional Bose-Einstein correlation analyses\n\nThe study of multi-dimensional BEC has gained considerable interest in recent years, in particular in heavy-ion collisions sector, but also in particle reactions. In the framework of the\nLund hadronisation model it is expected that the emitter shape will deviate significantly from\na sphere and that an elongation' of the source should occur. Three LEP experiments, in their\nstudy of the process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 \u22c6 /Z 0 \u2192 hadrons, have analysed their data in the Longitudinal\nCentre-of-Mass System with the aim of extracting values for the longitudinal rz (= rl ), transverse rT and side rside dimensions (see Sec. 2.4). These are summarised in Table 5 together\nwith the results from the ZEUS experiment at HERA ep collisions which confirm that the ratios\nrside /rz and rT /rz are significantly smaller than one. Missing however is a control experiment\nthat will show that in the case of a genuine spherical emitter the multi-dimensional analysis\n31\n\n\fprocedure will in fact yield the results that rside /rz \u2248 rT /rz \u2248 1.\nA somewhat surprising result which came out of the BEC multi-dimensional analysis of\npion-pairs is the dependence of rz , as well as rside and rT , on the transverse mass mT . An\nexample of this rz dependence on mT is the one reported by the DELPHI collaboration [113]\nwhich is shown in Fig. 15. This rz (mT ) behaviour is very similar to that seen in heavy ion\ncollisions where it is often attributed to nuclei collective effects which should be absent in\nparticle reactions and in particular in e+ e\u2212 annihilations. A theoretical understanding in terms\nof the Lund model of this effect in particle reactions is apparently still lacking even if only for\nthe reason that the inclusion of the BEC effect into the model is a highly non-trivial task and\nstill seems to need further improvements [114, 115].\nTable 5: Evidence for the elongation of the source from experimental results for the ratios rside /rz\nand rT /rz obtained from multi-dimensional BEC analyses of identical charged pions.

This \u2206t value is compatible with the corresponding value of (1.2 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 10\u221224 sec obtained in [102] from a fit to r(m) in view of the considerable spread of the r values obtained\nfrom the 1-dimensional BEC analyses carried out with the LEP1 data. In heavy-ion collisions\nthe longitudinal range rz wasqalso observed to be inversely proportional to the square root of\nmT [12] namely, r(mT ) \u2248 2/ mT [GeV ] fm where the difference between the proportionality\nfactor of 0.354 and 2.0 can be accounted for by the difference in the extent of the heavy ion\ntargets as compared to that existing in the e+ e\u2212 annihilation.\nThe dependence of the transverse dimension rT on the two-pion transverse mass mT has\nalso been measured in the hadronic Z 0 decays [117]. Here again the transverse range was found\nto decrease as mT increases. However unlike rz which is a geometrical quantity, rT is a mixture\nof the transverse radius and the emission time difference between the two hadrons so that a\nstraightforward application of the uncertainty relations is improper.\n\n7.2\n\nApplication of the Bjorken-Gottfried relation to r(mT )\n\nAnother approach to account for the dependence of rZ and rT on the mass of the hadron\nhas been taken in Refs. [118, 119]. In that approach the parameters characterising the particle\nemission region are mass independent and the observed change in radii is solely the consequence\nof the momentum-position correlation as expressed in the Bjorken-Gottfried condition [120\u2013\n123]. In this hypothesis there exists a linear relation between the 4-momentum of the produced\nparticle and the time-space position at which it is produced, namely\nq\u03bc = \u03bbx\u03bc\n\nwhich implies\n\u03bb = mT /\u03c4 ,\n\u221a\nwhere mT is the transverse mass and \u03c4 = t2 \u2212 z 2 is the longitudinal proper time after the\ncollision. In the framework of this hypothesis relations between the longitudinal and transverse\nradii and the transverse mass can be derived. These are given in Fig. 16 by the dashed bands\nwhere they are seen to adequately describe the results obtained from the 1-dimensional BEC\nanalyses carried out with the LEP1 data.\n\n7.3\n\nr(m) and the interatomic separation in Bose condensates\n\nThe observation that the dimensions\nr and rz derived from BEC analyses are seen respectively\n\u221a\n\u221a\nto be inversely proportional to m and mT , naturally arouses the curiosity whether similar\n34\n\n\fR [ fm ]\n\nMass Dependen e of HBT Correlations in\n\ne+ e\n\nAnnihilation (II)\n\n2907\n\n0\n\nR0 (K,\u039b ) ALEPH\n0\nR0 (K,\u039b ) DELPHI\n0\nR0 (K,\u039b ) OPAL\n\n1\n\nR||\n0.8\n\nR\u22a5\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\nR\u22a5 (\u03c0) DELPHI\nR|| (\u03c0) DELPHI\nR\u22a5=Rtside (\u03c0) L3\nR|| (\u03c0) L3\nR\u22a5=Rtside (\u03c0) OPAL\nR|| (\u03c0) OPAL\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\nm [ GeV ]\nFig. 1.\n\nRk\n\nand\n\nR?\n\nal ulated from the model (shaded bands) for\n\n\u0019; K; p; \u0003.\n\nData\n\n= m\u0019 represent\nresults of 2- and 3-dimensional analysis of LEP data [4\u2104.\nFigure 16: rz (=R|| )Forand\nrT (=R\nof the transverse mass mT taken from Refs.

Nevertheless, sin e the observed mass dependen e of the\ntailed theoretical aspects of the Bose-Einstein condensation can be found in Ref.

Concise summaries, aimed in particular\nto the non-expert, both of the experimental aspects and the theoretical background, can be\nfound in Refs. [128, 129]. To form Bose condensates, extremely dilute gases have to be cooled\ndown below the critical temperature TB , so that the formation time of molecules and clusters\nin three-body collisions is slowed down to seconds or even minutes to prevent the creation of\nthe more familiar transitions into liquid or even solid states.\n\nThe existence of Bose-Einstein condensation was first demonstrated in 1995 by three groups\n[130\u2013132] in cooling down rubidium, sodium and lithium. Typical temperatures where Bose\ncondensates occur are in the range of 500 nK to 2 \u03bcK with atom densities between 1014 and\n1015 cm\u22123 . The largest sodium condensate has about 20 million atoms whereas hydrogen condensate can reach even one billion atoms.\nLet us now consider a dilute homogeneous ideal gas of N identical bosonic atoms of spin\nzero confined in a volume V . These atoms occupy \u01ebi energy levels, handled here as a continuous\nvariable, which are distributed according to the Bose-Einstein statistics. We further set the\n35\n\n\fground state to be \u01eb0 = 0. If N0 is the number of atoms in this ground state and Nex is the\nnumber of atoms in the excited states then N = N0 + Nex . For a homogeneous ideal gas of\nidentical bosonic atoms it can be shown (see e.g. Ref. [133]) that at a low temperature T one\nhas\n!3/2\n2\u03c0mkT\nNex = 2.612 V\n,\n(60)\nh2\nwhere V is the volume occupied by the atoms of mass m. Since TB is defined as the temperature\nwhere almost all bosons are still in excited states, we can, to a good approximation, equate N\nwith Nex . That is\n!3/2\n2\u03c0mkTB\nN = 2.612 V\n.\n(61)\nh2\nFor T < TB one obtains from Eqs. (60) and (61) that the number of atoms N0 which are in\nthe condensate state is,\n\"\n\u0012\n\u0013 #\nT 3/2\nN0 = N \u2212 Nex = N 1 \u2212\n,\n(62)\nTB\nwhere T is the temperature of the atoms lying at the excited energy states above the condensate\nenergy level \u01eb0 = 0. The atomic density of the Bose gas at very low temperatures, T /TB << 1\nwhere N \u2248 N0 , is then given by\nN\n2\u03c0mkT\n\u03c1=\n= 2.612\nV\nh2\n\n!3/2\n\n,\n\n(63)\n\nwhere k is the Boltzmann constant and \u03c1, the atomic density, has the dimension of L\u22123 . From\nthis follows that \u03c1\u22121/3 is the average interatomic separation in the Bose condensate. At the\nsame time the thermal de Broglie wave length is equal to\n\u03bbdB =\n\nh2\n2\u03c0mkT\n\n!1/2\n\n.\n\n(64)\n\nCombining Eqs. (63) and (64) one has for the state of a Bose condensate the relation\n\u03c1\u03bb3dB \u2248 2.612 .\n\n(65)\n\nThus the average interatomic distance in a Bose condensate, dBE , is equal to\ndBE \u2261 \u03c1\u22121/3 \u2248 \u03bbdB /1.378 .\n\n(66)\n\nNext one can consider two different bosonic gases, having atoms with masses m1 and m2 ,\nwhich are cooled down to the same very low temperature T0 , below the critical temperature TB\nof both of them. In this case one produces two Bose condensates with interatomic distances\n\u221a\n!1/2\nh\u03042\n2\u03c0\n; i = 1, 2 .\n(67)\ndBE (mi ) \u2248\n1.378 mi kT0\nFrom this follows that when two condensates are at the same fixed temperature T0 one has\ndBE (m1 )\n=\ndBE (m2 )\n36\n\ns\n\nm2\n,\nm1\n\n(68)\n\n\fwhich is also the expectation of Eq. (44) for the r dependence on the mass of the hadron produced in high energy reactions provided \u2206t is fixed. Finally it is interesting to note that in as\nmuch as one is justified, since almost all the atoms occupy the same quantum mechanical state,\nto replace in Eq. (67), at very low temperatures, kT0 by \u2206E and use the uncertainty relation\n\u2206E\n\u221a = h\u0304/\u2206t one derives the expression for r(m) as given by Eq. (44) multiplied by the factor\n2\u03c0/1.378. Thus in Bose-Einstein condensates r(m) measures the interatomic separation and\nnot the dimension of the condensate ensemble, a deduction which will be further referred to in\nSec. 8.\nIn relating the condensates to the production of hadrons in high energy reactions one should\n\u221a\nkeep in mind that the interatomic separation proportionality to 1/ matom does not necessarily\nimply that it should also apply to hadrons produced in high energy reactions. Common to\nboth systems is their bosonic nature which allows all hadrons (atoms) to occupy the same\nlowest energy state. In addition the condensates are taken to be in a thermal equilibrium state.\nAmong the various models proposed for the production of hadrons in high energy e+ e\u2212 and\nnucleon-nucleon reactions some attempts have also been made to explore the application of a\nstatistical thermal-like model [134]. Whether this approach will eventually prevail is at present\nquestionable. Finally the condensates are taken to be in a coherent state. In the case of hadrons\none is able to measure r via BEC only if the chaoticity factor \u03bb in Eq. (9) is different from\nzero i.e., only if the source is not 100% coherent. However so far there is no evidence from\nBEC studies in hadron production for a dependence of r on \u03bb apart from that introduced by\nthe correlated errors between \u2206r and \u2206\u03bb produced by fitting Eq. (9) to the data.\n\n8\n\nOn the relation between r and the emitter size\n\nAs it has been pointed out in the introduction, the HBT interferometry in astronomy and its\nequivalent, the GGLP correlations in its application to heavy ion collisions, have been rather\nsuccessful in estimating respectively the dimensions and configurations of stellar objects and\nthe geometrical extent of nuclei. In the elementary particle sector it looks as if the r dimension\nis very little if at all dependent on the type and energy of the reaction. Furthermore e+ e\u2212\nannihilations, there seem to be several features which pose a challenge to the general belief\nthat r measures a quantity which represents the emitter volume and corresponds to its radius\nin the spherical approximation.\nIn the Lund string model one expects that the extension of the emitter of hadrons in elementary particle reactions will increase with multiplicity and hence with energy and certainly\nin e+ e\u2212 annihilation at 91 GeV will spread over more than several fm. From the Bose-Einstein\ncorrelation analyses there is no evidence for such a behaviour. In fact, the r values obtained\nfrom \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u00b1 pairs produced in e+ e\u2212 annihilation seem to be rather independent of energy having\nvalues in the vicinity of 0.75 fm (see Table 1).\nMoreover, recent experimental results show that the dimension r, measured in e+ e\u2212 annihilations on the Z 0 mass energy, does depend on the hadron mass. As shown in Sec. 6, the\nr values at the proton and \u039b masses decrease to the very low value of \u223c0.15 fm as compared\nto approximately 0.75 fm for pions and kaons. This behaviour of r(m) is very similar to the\ninteratomic separation dependence on the atomic mass in equal temperature Bose condensates.\nIn as much as one is justified to infer from the Bose condensates features to the hadron pro37\n\n\fduction sector, r(m) apparently does not measure the emitter radius but rather the distance\nbetween two neighbouring identical hadrons.\nIn any case, the experimental results found for the dependence of r on the hadron mass are\nnot reconcilable with the notion of a unique emitter radius for all outgoing hadrons. However\nthe possibility that baryons are emitted from a much smaller source than pions and kaons has\nits own difficulty [135] if one considers the source energy density \u01eb. To illustrate this problem\nlet us assume that the emitter source is a sphere of radius r, as determined from the correlation\nanalysis, filled homogeneously with at least the energy which corresponds to the sum of the\nrest masses of the two outgoing identical hadrons. Then, for a given hadron mass mh and its\nemitter radius rh , the energy density of the source is given by\n\n\u01ebmeasured =\n\n3 2mh\n4\u03c0 rh3\n\n(69)\n\nwhich is plotted in Fig. 17 for the pion, kaon, proton and \u039b pairs. The dashed lines in the\nfigure are the predicted dependence of the energy density on the hadron mass computed from\nEq.

(70) setting \u2206t to plus and minus three\nstandard deviations away from its median value of 1.2 \u00d7 10\u221224 seconds [135].\n\nIn trying to cope with these observations, it may be helpful to try and identify the underlying variable or variables, apart from the hadron mass, which r depends on. A partial\n38\n\n\fanswer to this quest [136], which is briefly outlined in the following section, is provided by the\nrelation between the BEC analysis and the genuine particle correlation method which utilises\nthe factorial cumulant moments (see Sec. 2.3).\n\n8.1\n\nThe r dependence on the number of emitting sources\n\nLet us consider a simplified description of heavy ions (AA) interactions at high energies which\nis given in terms of several distinct, say S, primary nucleon-nucleon (nn) collisions leading to\nhadrons. In this approach the hadrons produced in a single primary nucleon-nucleon reaction\nare emitted from an Snn source. The hadron produced in heavy ion (AA) collisions are then\ncoming from SAA sources so that SAA /Snn =S. Since here the AA collisions are described in\nterms of the single primary nucleon-nucleon reactions one can define, without loss of generality,\nSnn as a unit source so that SAA = S.\nNext the \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u00b1 pairs emerging from a single primary nucleon-nucleon reaction and those\nemerging from the heavy ion collisions are subject to BEC analyses and the correlation functions\nC2S=1(Q) = 1 + \u03bbS=1 e\u2212Q\n\n2 r2\nS=1\n\nand\n\nC2S (Q) = 1 + \u03bbS e\u2212Q\n\n2 r2\nS\n\nare fitted, each to its corresponding data distribution. In general for every S value the resulting\nrS can be extracted from the fitted correlation functions by integration C2 \u2212 1 over Q from\nzero to infinity so that\n\u221a\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221eh\ni\n1 \u03bbS \u03c0\n2\n\u2212Q2 rS\nS\n\u03bbS e\ndQ =\nC2 (Q) \u2212 1 dQ =\n,\n(71)\n2 rS\n0\n0\nwhere \u03bbS is, as customary in the BEC analyses, taken to be independent of Q.\nFor the two-particle correlation there exists a relation (see e.g. Ref. [137]) between the\ncumulant K2 and the BEC function C2 , namely that\nC2 (Q) = 1 + \u03bbe\u2212r\n\n2 Q2\n\n= 1 + K2 .\n\n(72)\n\nIn addition it has been shown [138\u2013140] that for two particle correlation the cumulant K2S of S\nsources is, to a very good approximation, related to the value of the corresponding cumulant\nof one source, K2S=1 , by\nK2S = K2S=1 /S .\nThus the BEC function C2S is equal to\n2\n\nC2S (Q)\n\n2 Q2\n\u2212rS\n\n= 1 + \u03bbS e\n\n2\n\nK S=1\n\u03bbS=1 e\u2212rS=1Q\n= 1 + 2\n= 1 +\n.\nS\nS\n\n(73)\n\nBy integrating Eq. (73) over Q from zero to infinity one finally obtains that\nrS = S\n\n\u03bbS\nrS=1 ,\n\u03bbS=1\n\n(74)\n\nwhere S like the \u03bb parameters is taken to be independent of Q. Consequently if the increase\nof an emitter volume is coupled to an increase in the number of boson sources, then the BEC\nextracted rS will grow as well. Further to note is that if in heavy-ion collisions S\u03bbS /\u03bbS=1 is\n39\n\n\fproportional to A1/3 then r will be proportional to the nucleus radius. As for the HBT analysis\napplied in astronomy, the proportionality between the stellar object dimension and the number\nof photon sources is self-evident.\nFrom the discussion above it is obvious that the choice of the unit source determines the\npredicted dependence of r on the various features, such as type and energy, of the hadron (or\nphoton) emitting reaction. In the case of heavy ion collisions the choice of the unit source to\nbe a single primary nucleon-nucleon collision is a natural one. In the case of e+ e\u2212 annihilation\none may consider the possibility that See itself is the unit source. Under this assumption the\nnumber of sources does not change with energy and r will remain constant. This prediction\nseems to be consistent with the measured r values allowing for the fact that the various experiments used different analysis methods and reference samples (see Sec. 5.1). On the other\nhand an increase of r as a function of the hadron multiplicity has been observed in the BEC\nanalysis [22] of equally non-zero charged pion-pairs emerging from the Z 0 decay. Furthermore\nthe same experiment also found that the extracted r value from the Z 0 decays into three hadron\njets was by about 10% higher than that obtained from the Z 0 decay events having only two\nhadron jets. Similar rise of r with the average hadron multiplicity has also been reported by\nseveral hadron-hadron collision experiments carried out at centre of mass energies above 30\nGeV [73, 141\u2013143].\nThese last findings indicate that apparently for the e+ e\u2212 annihilations a reasonable choice\nfor the unit source is the single hadron jet. The shortcoming of such a choice is however the\nfact that the charge multiplicity of a hadron jet depends on its energy and on its origin, i.e. if it\nis a quark or a gluon [144\u2013146], which currently impedes a detailed quantitative prediction for\nthe behaviour of r as a function of the centre of mass energy and the multiplicity. Regardless\nof these hindrances, the adaptation of the hadron jet as a unit source provides nevertheless a\nqualitative explanation for the increase of r with multiplicity and also expects in e+ e\u2212 annihilations a moderate dependence of r on the e+ e\u2212 centre of mass energy.\n\n9\n\nSummary and conclusions\n\nThe 1-dimensional Bose-Einstein correlation enhancement measured in identical pion-pairs close\nin time-phase space, is found to be a universal phenomenon present in a large variety of particle reactions and over a wide range of energies. Nevertheless, there are still missing systematic\nBEC studies concentrating on the same reaction at different energies, and/or different reactions\nat the same energy, which will allow a comprehensive investigation of the dependence of r on\nthe variables that characterise the particle interactions. Notwithstanding the fact that these\nsystematic studies are still missing and that BEC analyses cannot currently be considered as\nprecision measurements, the extracted r values, which are taken to represent the hadron emitter source, seem to be very little, if at all, dependent on the reaction type or on its energy and\nthey are seen to fluctuate in the range of about 0.6 to 1.0 fm.\nThe essentially constant r value seems to be in contradiction with the results obtained\nfrom the BEC studies of heavy-ion collisions and from the HBT analyses of stellar objects.\nAn insight into the origin of this difference is offered by the relation between the BEC and\nthe cumulant moments analysis where the introduction of the so called hadron source plays a\n40\n\n\fcentral role. From this relation follows that the value of r is proportional to the number of\nactive hadron sources which participate in the reaction. In particle reactions the proposal to\nequate the number of sources with the number of hadron jets offers an understanding of the\nr dependence on multiplicity. At the same time however the difficulty in defining a standard\nhadron jet prohibits presently any quantitative results.\nThe genuine higher order BEC analyses are presently restricted to three\n\u221a identical charged\n\u221a\npions. Assuming a Gaussian hadron emitter, the expected relation r2 / 3 \u2264 r3 \u2264 r2 / 2 between the two and three-pion BEC dimension parameters, is found to be consistent within\nerrors with the measurements carried out in e+ e\u2212 annihilation and hadron collisions. The\ndirect measurement of the genuine correlations of four and more pion systems has not been\nrealised so far. On the other hand the extracted r values from the , so to speak, non-genuine\ncorrelations, are model dependent and as such less reliable.\nRecently first results from 2 and 3-dimensional BEC analyses of pion-pairs have been reported. These verified the Lund string model expectation that the hadron emitter source\ndeviates from a sphere and is elongated in the thrust (or sphericity) direction of the multihadron final state. In the approximation that the emitter has an elongated prolate ellipsoid\nshape, where the long axis rl is in the thrust direction and rT is the axis perpendicular to it,\nthe ratio rT /rl is found be in the range of \u223c0.7 to \u223c0.8.\nThe extension of the BEC analysis to the fermion sector was shown to be feasible via the\nPauli exclusion principle. First results from the so called Fermi-Dirac correlation analysis of\nthe \u039b\u039b and proton\u2212proton pairs, emerging from the hadronic Z 0 decays, have demonstrated\nthat the dimension r is strongly dependent on the mass of the identical hadrons. It has been\nfurther shown that this dependence can be accounted for by the Heisenberg uncertainty\nrela\u221a\ntions, or alternatively by QCD derived potential, to yield the relation r(m) \u221d 1/ m. Similar\nrelation is seen to be valid also in the 2-dimensional BEC analysis when r is replaced by the rl\nand m by the transverse mass mt . It is interesting further to note that the interatomic sepa\u221a\nration in the Bose condensates having the same low temperature, is proportional to 1/ matom .\nSo far the FDC analyses were restricted to the Z 0 hadronic decays, therefore it is essential\nthat they will be repeated in other particle reactions to verify that indeed r of the \u039b and the\nproton pairs is in the vicinity of 0.15 fm. This small r value, derived from the FDC analyses\nof baryon-pairs, poses a challenge to the concept that r represents the hadron emitter radius.\nIf one does insist on keeping the radius emitter interpretation for r then one encounters the\nsituation of an unreasonable high energy density value, of some 100 GeV/fm3 , of the baryons\nsource. Thus the very small r\u039b\u039b and rpp values indicate that our level of understanding the\nproduction of hadrons, and in particular baryons, is apparently far from being satisfactory.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nI would like to express my thanks to my colleagues G.
