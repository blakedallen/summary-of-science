The nullity theorem due to [11] is a particular case. The\npapers [17] and [19] show the recent interest in the nullity theorem. It is our hope that\nthis general formula (1.1) enhances the insight in rank structured matrices.\nIn addition, in Section 3 we will address the so-called \"generic minimal rank problem\". This problem was introduced by Professors Gilbert Strang and David Ingerman.\n\n2\n\nMinimal ranks of matrices and their inverses\n\nLet us recall the notion of partial matrices and their minimal rank. Let F be a field and\nlet n, m, \u03bd1 , . . . , \u03bdn , \u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bcm be nonnegative integers. The pattern of specified entries\nin a partial matrix will be described by a set J \u2282 {1, . . . , n} \u00d7 {1, . . . , m}. Let now\nAij , (i, j) \u2208 J, be given matrices with entries in F of size \u03bdi \u00d7 \u03bcj . We will allow \u03bdi\nand \u03bcj to equal 0. The collection of matrices A = { Aij ; (i, j) \u2208 J} is called a partial\n\u03bdi \u00d7\u03bcj\nblock matrix with the pattern J. A block matrix B = (Bij )ni=1, m\nis\nj=1 with Bij \u2208 F\ncalled a completion of A if Bij = Aij , (i, j) \u2208 J. The minimal rank of A (notations: min\nrank(A)) is defined by min rank(A) = min{rank B : B is a completion of A}.\nA completion of A with rank min rank(A) is called a minimal rank completion of\nA. When all the blocks are of size 1 \u00d7 1 (i.e., \u03bdi = \u03bcj = 1 for all i and j), we will simply\ntalk about a partial matrix. Clearly, any block matrix as above may be viewed as a\npartial matrix of size N \u00d7 M as well, where N = \u03bd1 + . . . + \u03bdn , M = \u03bc1 + . . . + \u03bcm . It will\nbe convenient to represent partial block matrices in matrix format. As usual a question\nmark will represent an unknown block. For instance, A = {Aij : 1 \u2264 j \u2264 i \u2264 n} will\nbe represented as\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nA11 ? . . .\n?\n.. \uf8f7\n.. ..\n\uf8ec ...\n.\n.\n. \uf8f7\nA=\uf8ec\n..\n\uf8ed ...\n.\n? \uf8f8\nAn1 . . . . . . Ann\nThe formula that connects the minimal ranks of triangular parts of a matrix and\nits inverse is the following. The result appeared originally in [22] (see also [23] and\nChapter 5 of [24]).\nTheorem 2.1 [22] Let T = (Tij )ni,j=1 be an invertible block matrix with Tij of size\n\u03bdi \u00d7 \u03bcj , where \u03bdi \u2265 0, \u03bcj \u2265 0 and N = \u03bdi + . . . + \u03bdn = \u03bci + . . . + \u03bcn . Put T \u22121 = (Sij )n1,j=1\nwhere Sij is of size \u03bci \u00d7 \u03bdj . Then\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n?\n?\n***\n?\nT11\n?\n***\n?\n\uf8ec S21 ?\n\uf8ec T21 T22 * * *\n***\n?\uf8f7\n? \uf8f7\n= N.\n+ min rank \uf8ec\nmin rank \uf8ec\n..\n.. \uf8f7\n.. \uf8f7\n..\n..\n..\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed ...\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\uf8f8\n.\nTn1\n\nTn2\n\n***\n\nSn1\n\nTnn\n\n2\n\n***\n\nSn,n\u22121\n\n?\n\n\fAs we will see, one easily deduces from Theorem 2.1 that the inverse of an upper\nHessenberg matrix has the lower triangular part of a rank 1 matrix. The strength of\nTheorem 2.1 lies in that one easily deduces a multitude of such results from it.\nFrom the same paper [22] we would also like to recall the following result.\nTheorem 2.2 [22] The partial matrix T = {Tij : 1 \u2264 j \u2264 i \u2264 n} has minimal rank\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\nT\n.\n.\n.\nT\nT\n.\n.\n.\nT\ni+1,1\ni+1,i\nn\u22121\nn\ni1\nii\nX\n.\n.. \uf8f8 X\n.. \uf8f8 .\nmin rank T =\nrank \uf8ed ..\n\u2212\nrank \uf8ed ...\n.\n.\ni=1\ni=1\nTn1 . . . Tni\nTn1 . . . Tni\nAfter the n = 2 case of Theorem 2.2 is obtained it is straightforward to prove the\ngeneral case by introduction. For the 2 \u00d7 2 case of Theorem 2.2 one needs to observe\nthat the minimal rank of\n\u0012\n\u0013\nT11 ?\nT21 T22\n\u0012\n\u0013\nT11\nwill at least be the rank of\nplus the minimal number of columns in T22 that\nT21\ntogether with the columns of T21 span the column space of ( T21 T22 ) . Once such a\nminimal set of columns in T22 has been identified, put any numbers on top of these\ncolumns. Now any other columns in T22 can be completed to be a linear combination\nof fully completed columns. Doing this leads to a completion of rank\n\u0012\n\u0013\nT11\nrank\n+ rank ( T21 T22 ) \u2212 rankT21 ,\nT21\nyielding the n = 2 case of Theorem 2.2.\nThe proof of Theorem 2.1, which can be found in [22] is easily derived from Theorem\n2.2 and the nullity theorem, which we recall now.\nTheorem 2.3 [11] Consider\n\u0012\n\nA\nC\n\nB\nD\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\nP\nR\n\nQ\nS\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\nThen dim ker C = dim ker R.\nProof. Since CP = \u2212DR , P [ker R] \u2286 ker C. Likewise, since RA = \u2212SC, we get\nA[ker C] \u2286 ker R. Consequently,\nAP [ker R] \u2286 A[ker C] \u2286 ker R.\nSince AP + BR = I , AP [ker R] = ker R, thus\nA[ker C] = ker R.\n3\n\n\fThis yields dim ker C \u2265 dim ker R. By reversing the roles of C and R one obtains also\nthat dim ker R \u2265 dim ker C. This gives dim ker R = dim ker C, yielding the lemma. \u0003\nThe nullity theorem is in fact the n = 2 case of Theorem 1. Indeed, if\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121 \u0012\n\u0013\nT11 T12\nS11 S12\n\u22121\nT =\n=\n,\nT21 T22\nS21 S22\nwe get from Theorem 1 that\n\u0012\n\u0013\nT11\nrank\n+ rank ( T21 T22 ) \u2212 rankT21 + rankS21 = N.\n(2.2)\nT21\n\u0012\n\u0013\nT11\nAs T is invertible we have that\nand ( T21 T22 ) are full rank, so (2.2) gives\nT21\n\u03bc1 + \u03bd2 \u2212 rank T21 + rank S21 = \u03bc1 + \u03bc2 = \u03bd1 + \u03bd2 ,\nand thus\n\u03bd2 \u2212 rank T21 = \u03bc2 \u2212 rank S21 ,\nwhich is exactly Theorem 3.\nTo make the connection with some of the results in the literature we need the\nfollowing proposition.\nProposition 2.4 Let T = {tij : 1 \u2264 j \u2264 i \u2264 n} be a scalar valued partial matrix.\nThen min rank (T ) = n if and only if tii 6= 0, i = 1, . . . , n, and tij = 0 for i > j.\nProof. The \"if\" part is immediate. For the only if part write\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nt11\nn\n.. \uf8f8 X\n\uf8ed\n+\nsi ,\nmin rankT = rank\n.\ni=2\ntn1\nwhere\n\nti1\n.\nsi = rank \uf8ed ..\ntn1\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nti1\ntii\n.. \uf8f8\n\u2212 rank \uf8ed ...\n.\n. . . tni\ntn1\n\n...\n\n...\n\nti,i\u22121\n\n. . . tn,i\u22121\n\n(2.3)\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8.\n\nAll the terms in (2.3) are at the most 1, and as there are exactly n terms they need\nto all be equal to 1 for min rank(T ) = n to be satisfied. But then sn = 1 implies\ntn1 = . . . = tn,n\u22121 = 0 and tnn 6= 0. Inductively, one can then show that sk = 1 implies\ntk1 = . . . = tk,k\u22121 = 0 and tkk 6= 0, k = n \u2212 1, . . . , 2. Finally the first column of T needs\nto have rank 1. As tij = 0, j = 2, . . . , n, was already established we get that t11 6= 0.\nThis proves the result. \u0003\nWe now easily obtain the following corollary, due to Asplund [1].\n4\n\n\fCorollary 2.5 [1] Let p \u2265 0 and A = (aij )N\ni,j=1 be an N \u00d7 N scalar matrix with inverse\nB = (bij )N\n.\nThen\na\n=\n0\nfor\nall\ni\nand\nj\nwith j > i + p, and aij 6= 0, j = i + p if\nij\ni,j=1\nand only if there exist a N \u00d7 p matrix F and a p \u00d7 N matrix G so that bij = (F G)ij ,\ni < j + p.\nProof. Let (Sij )i,j=N \u2212p+1 = A, where Si1 is of size 1 \u00d7 p, i = 1, . . . , n \u2212 p, SN \u2212p+1,1\nhas size p \u00d7 p, SN \u2212p+1,j has size p \u00d7 1, j = 2, . . . , N \u2212 p + 1, and all the other Sij are\nN \u2212p+1\n1 \u00d7 1. Let B = (Tij )i,j=1\nbe partitioned accordingly. Then, it follows from (1.1) that\n?\n\uf8ec S21\nmin rank \uf8ec\n\uf8ed ...\nSn1\n\uf8eb\n\n?\n?\n..\n.\n\n***\n***\n..\n.\n\n* * * Sn,n\u22121\n\n\uf8f6\n?\n?\uf8f7\n=N \u2212p\n.. \uf8f7\n.\uf8f8\n?\n\nif and only if\nT11\n\uf8ec T21\nmin rank \uf8ec\n\uf8ed ...\nTn1\n\uf8eb\n\n?\nT22\nTn2\n\n\uf8f6\n*** ?\n*** ? \uf8f7\n= p.\n.. \uf8f7\n..\n.\n. \uf8f8\n* * * Tnn\n\nUsing Proposition 2.4 the result now follows. \u0003\nIn a similar way it is easy to deduce results by [3], [16], [14], [15], [13] and [8] from\nTheorem 2.1. For instance, if Tij and Sij are scalars, and T21 , . . . , Tn,n\u22121 6= 0 and Tij = 0\nfor i > j + 1, then the left hand term in (1.1) is n \u2212 1. Since N = n, we get that the\nlower triangular partial matrix (Sij )i\u2265j has minimal rank 1. Thus one easily obtains\nthat Sij = ui vj , i \u2265 j, where u1 , . . . , un , v1 , . . . , vn are scalars. Examples like this show\nthat Theorem 2.1 is useful in the contexts of semi-separability and quasi-separability\n(see, e.g., [20] and [6] for an overview of these notions). We hope that the simplicity of\nformula (1.1) will help in the further development of these notions.\n\n3\n\nThe generic minimal rank completion problem\n\nRecently D. Ingerman and G. Strang posed the following problem. Suppose that a partial matrix (over some field F) has the property that all of its fully specified submatrices\nare of full rank and so that every k \u00d7 k partial submatrix has at most (2k \u2212 r)r entries\nspecified. Is it true that one can always complete to a matrix of rank \u2264 r? The count\nof (2k \u2212 r)r specified entries comes from the consideration that if r columns and r rows\nin a k \u00d7 k submatrix are specified, one can complete this submatrix to a rank r one\n(due to the fact that the submatrix in the overlap of the r columns and the r rows has\nfull rank). However, as soon as one adds one specified entry to these r columns and r\nrows, immediately a (r + 1) \u00d7 (r + 1) submatrix is specified, and the minimal rank will\nbe at least r + 1.\n\n5\n\n\fIngerman and Strang showed that the above statement is correct for r = 1. However,\nthe following example shows that in general it is not correct for r \u2265 2.\nExample. Consider the matrix\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n6 3 x 1\n\uf8ec3 1 1 y\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\nA := \uf8ec\n\uf8edz 1 2 3\uf8f8,\n1 w 1 1\nwhere x, y, z and w are the unknowns. Note that this partial matrix satisfies the\nrequirements stated in the first paragraph. Furthermore, suppose that rankA = 2.\nThen we have that\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u22121 \u0012\n\u0013\n6 3\nx 1\n2 3\nz 1\n\u2212\n= 0,\n3 1\n1 y\n1 1\n1 w\nand since the rank of the first term is 2, the second term must also have rank 2. Thus,\nwe have that xy 6= 1 and zw 6= 1. Next, we also have that\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u22121 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2 3\nx 1\n6 3\nz 1\n\u2212\n= 0.\n1 w\n1 1\n1 y\n3 1\nMultiplying on both sides with xy \u2212 1, the off-diagonal entries yield the following\nequations\nxy \u2212 6y \u2212 3x + 10 = 0, xy \u2212 6y \u2212 3x + 8 = 0.\nThese are not simultaneously solvable (as long as we are in a field where 8 6= 10). It\nshould be noted that this is a counterexample for any field in which 6 6= 9, 6 6= 1,\n3 6= 1, 9 6= 1 (so that we have full rank specified submatrices) and 8 6= 10. As an aside,\nwe note that for some of the small fields it may impossible to fulfill the nondegeneracy\nrequirement on the data. E.g., when F = {0, 1} a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix can only be nonsingular\nif zeroes are allowed in the matrix.\nIt should be noted that if one associates the bipartite graph with the partial matrix\n(see, e.g., [5]) one obtains a minimal eight cycle. Consequently, the bipartite graph\nis not bipartite chordal as bipartite chordality requires by definition the absence of\nminimal cycles of length 6 or greater. Notice that in the r = 1 case the condition on\nthe density of the specified entries prevents the existence of minimal cycles of length 6\nor more. We now arrive at the following conjecture.\nConjecture 3.1 Consider a partial matrix for which the bipartite graph is bipartite\nchordal. Suppose furthermore that any fully specified submatrix has full rank and that\nany k \u00d7 k submatrix has at most (2k \u2212 r)r entries specified. Then there exists a completion of rank r.\nWe can prove the conjecture for the subclass of banded patterns (cf. [25]).\n6\n\n\fTheorem 3.2 Consider a partial matrix with a banded pattern (as defined in [25]).\nSuppose furthermore that any fully specified submatrix has full rank and that any k \u00d7 k\nsubmatrix has at most (2k \u2212 r)r entries specified. Then there exists a completion of\nrank r.\nProof. By Theorem 1.1 in [25] it suffices to show that for every triangular subpattern\n(for the definition, see [25]) we have that the minimal rank is \u2264 r. But a triangular\nsubpattern can always embedded in a pattern that corresponds to r rows and columns\nspecified (due to the condition that in any k \u00d7k submatrix has at most (2k \u2212r)r entries\nare specified). But then the result follows. \u2737\nObserve that the proof shows that if the bipartite chordal minimal rank conjecture\nin [5] (see also Chapter 5 in [24]) is true, then the above conjecture is true as well. The\ntechniques developed in [2] and/or [12] may be helpful in proving the conjecture above.\n\nReferences\n[1] Asplund, Edgar Inverses of matrices {aij } which satisfy aij = 0 for j > i+p.
