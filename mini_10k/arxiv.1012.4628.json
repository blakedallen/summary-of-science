Introduction\nUnderstanding of the key factors that control the kinetics of enzyme catalysis has been a\nlong standing goal of chemists and biochemists [1-3]. The explicit role of water in controlling the\nenzyme kinetics and the pathway has often been discussed in the enzyme literature [4-8]. It is of\ncourse well-known that water plays a crucial role in determining the structure and function of\nbiomolecules. In a series of landmark papers, Fleming and co-workers have used three-pulse\nphoton echo peak shift (3PEPS) and time-resolved fluorescence depolarization techniques to\nmeasure the magnitudes and time scales of energy fluctuations of the chromophore eosin bound\nto lysozyme in aqueous solution at physiological temperature [9-11]. They have examined the\ninfluence of inhibitor binding on the internal motion of lysozyme [9-11]. In a separate study,\nFleming and co-workers examined the role of water on the residue motion of a protein using\nmolecular dynamics simulation [12]. The important finding of this study is that in the presence of\nwater the dynamics becomes slower [12]. Theese studies partly motivated us to study the role of\nwater in enzyme catalysis.\nWhile the specific role of water in the chemical step of enzymatic reactions has been\nexplored in great details by elegant papers of Warshel and co-workers [13-14], the explicit role\nof water in the conformational cycling step of enzyme catalysis has hardly been explored. Many\nof the earlier studies were carried out with an implicit solvent model (where water is replaced by\na dielectric continuum) in this context. Such studies have only a limited scope to understand the\nrole of water on the conformational fluctuation because they ignore much of specific interactions\n(such as hydrogen bonding) that a water molecule is capable of. The molecular dynamics study\nof ligand-induced flap closing in HIV-1 protease demonstrates that the structural water plays a\n\n\fcritical role in flap closing dynamics by destabilizing the hydrophobic clusters and subsequently\nby mediating the flap\u2212ligand interactions [15].\nCatalysis of the reaction, ATP + AMP \u2192 2ADP, by the enzyme adenylate kinase (ADK) is a\nsubject of tremendous current interest [16-23]. From the experimental kinetic data, the estimated\nrate of the catalysis for this reaction is 263 s-1 which corresponds to a barrier height of 55 \u2013 60\nkJ/mol. While may of the studies have concluded that the barrier is associated with\nconformational fluctuation of the ADK [16-22], recent study by Warshel and co-workers finds\nthat the activation barrier of ADK catalysis is primarily intrinsic due to the chemical step based\non their full EVB model [23]. Thus, whether this barrier is due to the conformational fluctuation\nor due to the intrinsic phosphate transfer step is not yet clear. Recent experimental results by\nKern and coworkers have implied the existence of an intermediate, half-open-half-closed\n(HOHC) state of ADK. However, the important issue of the mode of involvement of this\nintermediate state in determining the activation barrier and also in the enzyme catalytic cycle was\nleft unquestioned and unanswered [16-18]. Specific characterization and explicit demonstration\nof the role of this intermediate state were also not carried out. Pulse-EPR spectroscopy study of\nthe unliganded HIV-1 protease enzyme implies the existence of an intermediate\n\"semiopen/semiopen\" conformer which makes the understanding of the catalytic cycle\nsignificantly better [24].\nThere are several interesting issues about the coupling between the enzymatic fluctuation\n({Q} coordinates) and the intrinsic reaction (X coordinate) of the chemical reaction. Warshel and\ncoworkers [23] have examined whether there is a flow of energy from the {Q} coordinates to the\nX coordinate (and vice versa) during the cycle. They argued that enzymatic fluctuation does not\ncatalyze the chemical step [23]. However, in addition to the coupling of enzyme fluctuations to\n\n\fthe chemical step, there remains the important issue to the role of enzyme fluctuations leading to\nthe reaction geometry.\nIn a series of recent papers, Min, Xie and Bagchi discussed how such apparently non-reactive\nenzymatic fluctuation can help the intrinsic chemical step without any direct flow of energy [2526]. The enzymatic fluctuations may be required to bring the reactant to a configuration where\nthe chemical step can occur. If that particular reaction configuration is unique, then the rate of\nthe catalysis (k) can be written as\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n, where kConf is the rate of enzyme\n=\n+\n+\nk kConf kChem k S \u2212bind\n\nfluctuation to the unique geometry, kChem is the contribution from the intrinsic chemical step and\nkS-bind is the rate of the substrate binding to free enzyme. Min et al. showed how the rate\nconstants (kcat and KM) in Michaelis\u2013Menten (MM) (in original MM equation, kcat is only a\nfunction of kChem and KM is a function of kChem and substrate concentration) equation get modified\nby fast or slow rate of enzymatic conformational fluctuation [26]. Importantly, they also\ndiscussed how an enzyme can operate in a non-equilibrium steady state to enhance the rate of\ncatalysis [25-26]. These authors further pointed out that by staying in a non-equilibrium steady\nstate, the enzyme can minimize the free energy barrier for conformational displacement [25-26].\nParadoxically, operating from this non-equilibrium steady state may actually lead to a reduction\nof the role of conformational fluctuations in catalysis. However, this Min-Xie-Bagchi theory\nassumes the existence of an intermediate state in the relaxation of the enzyme conformation after\nthe product release and prior to another substrate capture. For this scenario to be applicable,\nthis intermediate state needs to have relatively long lifetime and certain degree of stability so that\na new substrate capture can occur after product release. We show below that the catalysis of\nADK nicely fits into this picture.\n\n\fWe use very long computer simulations (with explicit water) to obtain an appropriate two\ndimensional free energy surface (2DCFES), described below, and carry out theoretical analysis\nto explore the existence of the intermediate state. We observe an intermediate HOHC state of\nADK during the catalytic cycle and explicitly characterize the same. Importantly, cycling of the\nenzyme through the HOHC state is found to reduce the conformational free energy barrier by\nabout 20 kJ/mol. We find that the specific interactions of water with the polar amino acid\nresidues stabilize the HOHC intermediate state of the enzyme --- earlier simulation studies\nwithout explicit water failed to observe this state. We also discuss about the involvement of this\nintermediate enzymatic state in the catalytic cycle. In our present study, the calculated 2DCFES\ndescribe the conformational fluctuation of the enzyme in ligand free condition and we suppose\nthat the nature of the fluctuation does not depend on the presence of ligand. We also like to point\nout that the present work does not concentrate on the barrier of intrinsic chemical step and it has\nbeen calculated explicitly elsewhere [23].\n\nII. Configurational Reaction Coordinates (CRC)\nADK undergoes large amplitude motions during catalysis. Both LID and the NMP\ndomains open by a considerable amount to allow the ATP and AMP to get in, then close for the\nreaction and then again open to let the product go out. A key step in the catalysis (in addition, of\ncourse, to the chemical reaction step of phosphate transfer) can be another substrate capture after\nthe product release as the continuation of the cycle is important. We have examined the\nconformational fluctuation of ADK by following the evolution of root mean square deviation\n(RMSD). We have also calculated the center of mass distances between LID/NMP and CORE\ndomains and the inter-domain hinge angles. The result for the variation of RMSD, inter-domain\ndistance and hinge angle involving the LID domain is shown in Figure 1. The existence of the\n\n\fintermediate state of the ADK (HOHC) is evident in all the quantities plotted in figure 1 (the\nelliptic region in the middle). The centre of mass distance between the LID and CORE domains\nin the HOHC state is found to be about 26 \u00c5. The analysis also suggests that the conformational\nfluctuation in ADK is mainly due to the inter-domain displacement and not due to the change in\nstructure of corresponding domains as the time evolution of these two quantities is very similar.\n\nFigure 1\n\nTherefore, we choose the centre of mass distances between LID and CORE (RCM\nCORE)\n\nand NMP and CORE (RCM\n\nNMP-CORE)\n\nLID-\n\nas the two order parameters for the free energy\n\nsurface calculation. These serve as our configurational reaction coordinates.\n\n\fIII. The two-dimensional configurational free energy surface (2DCFES) and\nconformational activation barriers\nThe free energy surface of the corresponding domain motions of the ADK is calculated\nby using umbrella sampling (values of the parameter used are provided in the Method section.\nThe simulations involved more than 80,000 water molecules for the free energy calculations and\nspan more than 20 \u03bcs). The free energy surface has been obtained for the LID domain motion at\n13 distances of NMP-CORE and for the NMP domain motion at 27 distances of LID-CORE.\nThe configurational free energy surface, 2DCFES, of the free enzyme, as a function of\nCRC, is presented in Figure 2a. The conformation of ADK at RCM LID-CORE \u2248 26 \u00c5 and RCM NMPCORE\n\n\u2248 19 \u00c5 forms a stable minimum for the free enzyme. This conformation belongs neither to\n\nthe fully open state nor to the fully closed state ensemble. We have termed this ensemble of\nstable intermediate conformation as half-open-half-closed (HOHC) state hereafter. The presence\nof such a stable intermediate state is further confirmed by the trajectory analysis (see Figure 1).\nThe computed 2DCFES of the free enzyme reveals that the HOHC state is indeed a stable\nconformation of the ADK in solution. This state is separated by a barrier of about 60 kJ/mol from\nthe fully open state (RCM\n\nLID-CORE\n\n\u2248 29 \u00c5 and RCM\n\nNMP-CORE\n\n\u2248 21 \u00c5) and this corresponds to a\n\ntimescale for conformational fluctuation between the open and the HOHC states of the order of\nmilliseconds. This is consistent with the timescale (~ 286 s-1) observed in experiment [16-18].\nHowever, in the presence of the ligand, the closed state (RCM LID-CORE \u2248 20.5 \u00c5 and RCM NMP-CORE\n\u2248 18.3 \u00c5) is the stable state in the free energy surface. Thus, in a continuous catalytic cycle,\nADK may shuttle between the HOHC and the closed states, rather than between the fully open\nand the closed state.\n\n\fIf we assume that the barrier of conformational fluctuation, away from the closed state, does not\ndepend significantly on ligand binding, the conformational barrier ADK has to surmount from\nthe HOHC state to reach near the closed state is about 40 kJ/mol. This barrier height is much\nlower than that between fully open and fully closed states and timescale associated with this\nconformational cycling is also much smaller. In such a situation, the catalytic cycle of the ADK\ngets modified (will be discussed later). Thus, the presence of stable intermediate state of ADK\n(HOHC) reduces the conformational fluctuation barrier related to catalytic cycle by about 20\nkJ/mol. An additional outcome of our analysis is that the phosphate transfer might control the\nrate of the reaction.\n\nFigure 2(a)\n\n\fIIIA. Rugged and smooth free energy surfaces of the LID and NMP domain\nmotion\nIn Figure 2b, we show the free energy surfaces of the LID motion for intermediate NMPCORE separation (RCM NMP-CORE = 19 \u00c5). We find a stable minimum for the HOHC state of LID\ndomain which has a RCM\n\nLID-CORE\n\naround 26 \u00c5. This again suggests the presence of an\n\nintermediate state of ADK. Fully open state is separated by a barrier of 20 kJ/mol and fully\nclosed state is separated by a barrier of 25 kJ/mol from the HOHC state. Note that the free\nenergy surface of LID domain motion is quite rugged. We will discuss this issue later in detail.\nFigure 2c displays the free energy surfaces of the NMP domain motion for intermediate\nRCM LID-CORE separations (RCM LID-CORE = 25 \u00c5). We find that the minimum is located at RCM NMPCORE\n\n= 18.8 \u00c5. This is a stable intermediate state of ADK. Note that the free energy surface of\n\nNMP domain motion is relatively smooth as compared to the LID motion.\nFigure 2(b)\n\n35\nCM\nNMP-CORE\n\nR\n\n30\n\n= 19 \u00c5\n\n-1\n\nF (kJ mol )\n\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n20\n\n22\n\n24\n\n26\n(\u00c5)\n\nCM\nR LID-CORE\n\n28\n\n30\n\n\fFigure 2(c)\n\n35\n30\n\n-1\n\nF (kJ mol )\n\n25\n20\n15\n10\n\nR\n\nCM\nLID-CORE\n\n= 25 \u00c5\n\n5\n0\n17\n\n18\n\n19\nCM\nR NMP-CORE\n\n20\n\n21\n\n(\u00c5)\n\nIV. Structural characterization of the HOHC state\nIn the intermediate HOHC state of the enzyme, the center of mass distance between LID\nand CORE domains lies between the open and closed states. We superimpose the structures of\nopen (4AKE [27]), closed (1AKE [28]) and HOHC states of the enzyme to compare the domain\npositions as shown in Figure 3. The position of the LID domain in the HOHC state is clearly\nintermediate between the open and the closed states. The position of the NMP domain in the\nHOHC state is also found to be intermediate but closer to the open state structure.\nA search for HOHC state in available crystal structures solved for ADK also reveals the\npresence of a naturally occurring stable intermediate structure (1AK2 [29]). Superimposition of\n\n\fthe 1AK2 on closed and open forms of the enzyme indeed shows that the structure of 1AK2\ncorresponds to the structure of MD-proposed HOHC state in our study (see supplementary\nmaterial S1). In case of 1AK2, we also find that LID domain stays in an intermediate position,\nwhile NMP domain is in open state. The agreement is indeed startling!\n\nFigure 3\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nV. Role of water in stabilizing the half-open-half-closed state\nWe have calculated the pair correlation function of the oxygen atoms of water with\nrespect to the C\u03b1 atom of the polar histidine (His 134) residue, denoted by gE,H2O(r), and depicted\n\n\fin Figure 4. Note the appearance of the new water layer near the histidine residue in the HOHC\nstate which was not present in the closed state. This result clearly indicates that upon partial\nopening of the ADK, the polar groups become solvated by the surrounding water and eventually\nstabilize the HOHC state of the enzyme.\nFigure 4\n\n1\n\nClosed\nHOHC\n\ngE,H2O(r)\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nr (\u00c5)\nWe have calculated the solvent accessible polar and non-polar surface area of the ADK in\nthe closed and HOHC states. The surface representation of polar and non-polar residues of ADK\nand the calculated solvent accessible polar surface are in the two enzymatic states (see\nsupplementary material S2 for further formation) support the results obtained from gE,H2O(r). We\nalso find a much larger increase in accessible polar surface area for the CORE-LID interface than\n\n\fCORE-NMP interface upon opening which accounts for the more rugged free energy surface of\nthe LID domain motion.\n\nVI. Role of the half-open-half-closed state in the catalytic cycle\nA recent study on ADK has suggested that the ezymatic fluctuations are not important\nbecause the coupling between the enzyme fluctuation coordinate and the intrinsic reaction\ncoordinate is rather weak [23, 30-32]. Recent simulation study by Brooks and cowerkers [22]\nsuggests that the activation barrier from the open to the closed state is 52.3 KJ/mole (12.5\nkcal/mol), leading to a timescale again in millisecond. Here we find quite a similar free energy\nbarrier with the additional complexity due to the substantial ruggedness of the surface which will\nfurther slow down the open to closed state transition [33]. In this connection, there are two issues\nneed to be considered. First, in a continuous catalytic cycle, the enzyme fluctuations might never\noperate from the fully open state [25-26]. Thus, a continuous catalytic cycle might not experience\nthe full free energy barrier for the transition from fully open state to the closed state [25-26].\nTherefore, in such a situation the ruggedness of the free energy surface of enzymatic fluctuation\nwill enhance the rate of catalysis rather than retard it. Second is the involvement of the ATP and\nAMP in the transition state of the open to closed state transformation. For example, when LID is\nfully open, then the ATP binding to LID might actually be slower due to entropic reason, while\nATP binding to the HOHC state might be faster.\nPresent study with its finding of the intermediate state suggests that the cycle would\noperate in its most efficient state if the cycle ranges from the closed to the HOHC state and back.\nThis is illustrated in Figure 5a and the corresponding schematic contour diagram is presented in\nFigure 5b. If the enzyme captures ligand in HOHC state, its transition to closed state will be\n\n\ffaster than that from completely open state [25-26] as discussed earlier in the discussion of the\nfree two dimensional free energy surface section. This would reduce the time of the\nconformational cycling considerably. It is conceivable that both the conformational fluctuations\nand the phosphate transfer events have been tuned by the evolution to operate at certain rate. If\nthe intervention of the HOHC state reduces the time required for the conformational cycling,\nthen the intrinsic chemical reaction (phosphate transfer) step could be the rate determining step\nof the catalytic cycle. This would reconcile different theoretical observations. In figure 4b, we\nhave presented schematic contour diagram of the different conformational states of ADK and the\nshowed the important processes operating between them. Between HOHC and closed state the\ncatalytic cycle operates and between HOHC and fully open state the experimentally observed\nmillisecond conformational fluctuation occurs.\nA correlation observed between the opening of the LID and NMP domains suggests that\nthe HOHC-LID state also facilitates the NMP to remain in the open form. The free energy\nbarrier for the subsequent transition to the closed state is further reduced by the induced fit\nmechanism (the interaction between the ligand and the enzyme) and the corresponding schematic\nfree energy diagram [25-26] of the catalytic cycle is presented in supplementary material S3. The\nsteady state rate (\u03bd) of catalysis can be decomposed into [26]\n1\n1\n1\n1\n.\n=\n+\n+\nv kChem kConf ([ S ]) k S \u2212bind\n\n........... (1)\n\nHere kChem is the intrinsic rate of the phosphate transfer step (ES \u2192 EP) (see S3), kConf is the\ncontribution due to enzyme fluctuations and kS-bind is the rate of substrate binding to the enzyme\n(can be given by Smoluchowski rate). It can be shown that under the non-equilibrium condition\nof a working enzyme, the barrier on the E....S surface (see Figure S3) can be reduced\n\n\fconsiderably at high substrate concentration and presence of stable intermediate on the E....S\nsurface which can capture substrate [25-26]. Thus in such situation, kE...S\u2192ES (the step where\nenzyme fluctuation is important) can become large which in turn will make kenz large and\nessentially this term may dissappear from the above equation. Again, one can also argue that kSbind\n\ncan be large at the high substrate concentration limit, according Smoluchowski equation\n\n[25], and thus will make little contribution to the total rate. Thus in such a situation, the steady\nstate will be determined only by the intrinsic rate of the reaction (phosphate stransfer step).\n\nFigure 5(a)\n\n\fFigure 5(b)\n\nVII. Conclusion\nThere are three new resuts in this paper. First, we observe and characterize, for the first\ntime,\n\nthe presence of a half-open-half-closed (HOHC) state during the sojourn of the closed\n\nform, after the product (ADP) release, towards the fully open state. The HOHC state has actually\nbeen implied in earlier NMR studies, but missed in earlier simulations that used only implicit\nsolvent model. Our HOHC state is in excellent agreement with the naturally occuring stable\nintermediate IAK2. Our study reveals that the cycling of the enzyme through the HOHC state\nreduces the conformational free energy barrier by about 20 kJ/mol. Second, we find that the free\nenergy surface of the closed form of the LID domain is quite rugged. This ruggedness is mainly\ndue to the increased solvation by the surrounding water molecules upon partial opening. Finally,\n\n\fwe propose a modfied catalytic cycle for continuous conversion (Figure 5a) and a corresponding\nfree energy diagram of the catalytic cycle in the ezyme coordinate (supplementary material S3).\nA similar studies can also be carried out to understand the role of water in the emzymatic\ncatalyic cycle of HIV-1 protease [15,24].\n\nSystem and Methods\nFigure M1 shows the open and closed forms of the adenylate kinase superimposed on each other.\nThe enzyme can be viewed as three domains: (a) LID domain: the domain which closes on ATP binding\nto the ADK, (b) NMP domain: the domain which closes on AMP binding to the ADK, and (c) CORE\ndomain: the domain in which no significant conformational changes occurs upon ligand binding. The\nenzyme changes its conformation from open state to closed state during the ligand binding event. The\nLID and NMP domains open up to release the product and get ready to capture a new set of substrates for\nnext round of catalysis. These two conformations can be characterized by the two distances [27,28]: (1)\nthe distance between the centers of mass of the LID and the CORE domains, denoted by RCM LID-CORE (2)\nthe distance between the centers of mass of the NMP and the CORE domains, denoted by RCM NMP-CORE.\nThe values of the RCM\nsame for the RCM\n\nLID-CORE\n\nNMP-CORE\n\nfor open and closed forms are 29.5 \u00c5 and 20.5 \u00c5, respectively, and the\n\nfor open and closed forms are 21.0 \u00c5 and 18.3 \u00c5, respectively [27,28]. The\n\nLID domain is defined as residues 118-160, the NMP domain as residues 30-67, and the CORE domain as\nresidues 1-29, 68-117, and 161-214.\nAs mentioned earlier, several studies have been carried out to understand the role of conformational\nfluctuations on catalysis both experimentally and computationally. Here, we report for the first time a\nvery long time scale (individual runs of maximum 500 ns and total run time 2 \u03bcs) fully atomistic\nsimulation of ADK in explicit solvent environment. The long time scale provides us a unique opportunity\n\n\fto comment confidently on conformational fluctuations and probable binding events that might be\nhappening in ADK.\n\nFigure M1: Ribbon diagram open and closed forms of the adenylate kinase. Superposition of closed (1AKE\n[28]) and open (4AKE [27]) forms of adenylate kinase. The open form is colored green. The LID domain in closed\nform is colored in red, the NMP domain is in yellow, and the CORE domain is in gray.\n\nThe x-ray structure of the open form (4AKE [27]) was used as the starting structure for open state\nsimulations. To generate the starting structure for the closed state simulation, ligand (inhibitor AP5)\ncoordinates were removed from the x-ray structure of the closed form (1AKE [28]). All crystallographic\nwater molecules were stripped off from the pdb files. GROMACS v3.3.1 suite of programs was used for\nmolecular dynamics and other structural analysis [34]. Proteins were centered in a cubic box of 77.3 A.\nThe box size was so chosen that no atoms in the protein, either in open or in closed conformation, will be\nless than 10 \u00c5 from any of the box-boundaries. All atom topologies for proteins were generated with the\nhelp of pdb2gmx and AMBER94 set of parameters (available through AMBER port for GROMACS).\n\n\fThe proteins were solvated with pre-equilibrated SPC/E water model [35] using genbox. Total of 14511\nand 14496 water molecules were added to closed and open state boxes, respectively. Four sodium atoms\nwere added to achieve electrically neutrality. The systems were put through following cassette of energy\nminimization and equilibration steps: 1) Steepest descent energy minimization, 2) A 100 ps of positionrestrained NPT simulation with restraining force constant of 1000 kJ.mol-1nm-2, 3) A 100 ps of NVT\nequilibration without restraints, 4) A 100 ps of NPT equilibration, 5) The final NPT simulation of 350 ns.\nDuring simulations, temperature was maintained at 300 K using Nose-Hoover thermostat with \u03c4T = 0.1 ps\nand pressure was maintained isotropically at 1 bar using Berendsen barostat with \u03c4P = 0.5 ps. Isothermal\ncompressibility of water was set to 4.5\u00d710-5 bar-1. The trajectories are built with structures at 2 ps interval.\nRMSD: Root mean square deviation for backbone was calculated with the help of g_rms program\nwhen backbone of CORE domain was used for superimposition. The structures from both the trajectories\nwere superimposed onto the closed conformation of ADK. A common reference for both the trajectories\nwas chosen so that the distribution of RMSD can be easily studied. LID domain is defined as residues\n118-160, NMP as 30-67, and CORE domain is defined as residues 1-29, 68-117, and 161-214.\nAngle and distance: The C\u03b1 atoms of following residues are used to calculate distance between\nLID and CORE domains with g_dist: Val148 (from LID) and Glu22 (from CORE). The angle calculation\nis done by considering C\u03b1 atom of Pro9 (from hinge) in addition to C\u03b1 from Val148 and Glu22 with\ng_angle.\nUmbrella sampling: While RCMLID-CORE varies from 20.5 \u00c5 to 29.5 \u00c5 while going from closed\nconformation to open conformation, RCMNMP-CORE varies from 18.3 \u00c5 to 21.5 \u00c5. A two-dimensional freeenergy surface was constructed by taking RCM as reaction coordinates. RCMLID-CORE varied from 19.0 \u00c5 to\n32 \u00c5, and RCMNMP-CORE from 17 \u00c5 to 23 \u00c5, both at an interval of 0.5 \u00c5. Force constant of 3000 kJ.mol1\n\n.nm-2 was used to restrain the domains at respective RCM. Umbrella sampling simulations were performed\n\n\fusing pull code from GROMACS v4.0.5. Free energy surfaces are extracted using wham program. The\nsimulations involved more than 80,000 water molecules for the free energy calculations.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nWe thank Dr. H. Balaram, Dr. P.
