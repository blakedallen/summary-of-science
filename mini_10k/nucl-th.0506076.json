Recently,\nseveral modern realistic NN interactions have been constructed, e.g., the Argonne V18 [5],\nthe CD-Bonn [4], and chiral potentials [6], which reproduce the experimental NN phaseshifts with high accuracy. Within ab initio Green's function Monte Carlo [7] and no-core\nshell model calculations [8] of ground state properties and low-lying excitation spectra of\nlight nuclei it was shown that realistic NN interactions, supplemented by a three-nucleon\nforce, allow for a quantitative description of experimental data [9, 10].\nRealistic NN interactions cannot be directly employed in a standard Hartree-Fock (HF)\nscheme due to the importance of interaction-induced correlations in the many-body state\nbeyond the simple HF Slater determinant. Therefore, an effective, phase-shift equivalent\ninteraction has to be derived by explicitly accounting for the dominant correlations. One way\nto tackle this issue is the Unitary Correlation Operator Method (UCOM) which describes the\nshort-range central and tensor correlations by means of an unitary transformation [11, 12, 13,\n14]. The unitary transformation of the Hamiltonian including a realistic NN potential results\nin a correlated effective interaction well suited for the application with simple uncorrelated\nmany-body states. An alternative method to derive phase-shift equivalent, low-momentum\neffective interactions is the Vlow\u2212k renormalization group approach [15].\nStudies of collective excitation phenomena in atomic nuclei provide valuable insight into\nmany properties of the underlying effective interactions employed in solving the nuclear\nmany-body problem. In order to describe small-amplitude collective excitations within the\nUCOM framework, one can employ the random-phase approximation (RPA) [16], based on\nthe HF single-nucleon basis. Since three-body interactions presently are not included, the\nresults provide information on their importance for the understanding of collective nuclear\nexcitations. The UCOM-RPA model can also be employed to evaluate the contributions of\nRPA correlations to the ground state energy which go beyond the mean-field picture [17]. In\naddition to the short-range correlations described explicitly by the unitary transformation,\n\n\f3\nthe RPA ground state calculations allow for the inclusion of residual long-range correlations\nnecessary to obtain a realistic, ab initio-type description of nuclei.\nOn the other side, models based on phenomenological nuclear interactions have been well\nestablished over the past decades, and have been very accurately tuned to the properties of\nfinite nuclei. These models are nowadays successful not only in the region of stable nuclei,\nbut also in the description of exotic nuclear structure and collective excitations in nuclei\naway from the valley of \u03b2-stability, both in the non-relativistic [18, 19, 20] and relativistic framework [21, 22]. Particularly interesting is the phenomenon of the pygmy dipole\nresonance in neutron-rich nuclei (PDR), indicating that the loosely bound neutrons might\ncoherently oscillate against the approximately isospin-saturated proton-neutron core [23].\nVery recently it has been shown that for proton rich nuclei in the lower region of the nuclide\nchart, one also could expect the appearance of a low-energy exotic collective mode, i.e. the\nproton PDR, when loosely-bound protons vibrate against the rest of the nucleons [24]. The\nexperimental evidence about low-lying excitations in nuclei towards the drip-lines is still\nrather limited, and actually available only in light nuclei up to the oxygen isotopes [25].\nThe present article will summarize the recent progress in studies of low-lying excitations\ntowards the proton drip-line within the Relativistic Quasiparticle RPA (RQRPA).\n\nII.\n\nTHE HARTREE-FOCK MODEL IN THE UCOM FRAMEWORK\n\nThe UCOM approach aims at an explicit treatment of interaction-induced short-range\ncentral and tensor correlations in nuclei [11, 12, 13, 14]. These correlations are imprinted into\nan uncorrelated many-body state |\u03a8i through a state-independent unitary transformation\ndefined by the unitary operator C, resulting in a correlated state, |\u03a8\u0302i = C |\u03a8i. Due to the\nunitarity of the correlation operator, matrix elements of an operator O in correlated manybody states are equal to those evaluated using the correlated operator \u00d4 and uncorrelated\nmany-body states, i.e.\nh\u03a8\u0302| O |\u03a8\u0302\u2032i = h\u03a8| C\u2020 O C |\u03a8\u2032i = h\u03a8| \u00d4 |\u03a8\u2032 i.\n\n(1)\n\nThe short-range central and tensor correlations are separately included via the unitary operators Cr and C\u03a9 , respectively, and formulated as exponential functions of the two-body\nHermitian generators gr and g\u03a9 . The operator form of the generators is motivated by the\n\n\f4\nbasic physics of the two types of correlations we are going to describe explicitly.\nThe short-range central correlations are induced by the strong short-range repulsion in\nthe central part of realistic NN interactions. This repulsive core prevents nucleons in a\nmany-body system to approach each other closer than the characteristic size of the core.\nIn the two-body density matrix these correlations are revealed through the depletion of\nthe probability density for particle distances smaller than the core radius. In order to\ninclude these correlations into an uncorrelated many-body state, e.g., the Slater determinant\nof the Hartree-Fock approach, we perform a distance-dependent radial shift with respect\nto the relative coordinate of two-particles. The corresponding Hermitian generator gr =\n1\n[s(r)qr\n2\n\n+ qr s(r)] contains the radial component of the relative momentum operator, qr ,\n\nand a function s(r) which controls the distance-dependence of the shift. Implementation\nof the correlation operator in coordinate representation corresponds to a norm-conserving\ncoordinate transformation r 7\u2192 R\u2212 (r) rr of the relative coordinate. The radial correlation\nfunction R\u2212 (r) and its inverse R+ (r) are related to the shift function s(r) [13, 14].\nFor the following calculations the Argonne V18 (AV18) potential [5] is used. In practice,\nthe correlation functions R+ (r) are parameterized and the optimal parameters are determined for each spin-isospin channel from an energy minimization in the two-body system\n[14]. Since the (S = 1, T = 1)-channel of the AV18 potential is purely repulsive, we employ\na simple constraint on the range of the correlation function in this channel in order to avoid\nartificial long-range correlation functions. We have checked explicitly that the effect of variations of this constraint around the value that ensures the short-range of the correlation\nfunction, is negligible for all calculations presented here.\nA second, equally important type of correlations is induced by the tensor part of the\ninteraction [12]. They entangle the relative spatial orientation of two nucleons with their\nspin orientation. The generator g\u03a9 has to describe an angular shift depending on the spin\norientation. This is achieved by g\u03a9 =\n\n3\n\u03b8(r)[(\u03c3 1 *\n2\n\nq\u03a9 )(\u03c3 2 * r) + (\u03c3 1 * r)(\u03c3 2 * q\u03a9 )], where\n\nq\u03a9 = q\u2212 rr qr [12]. As for the central correlations, the tensor correlation functions \u03b8(r), which\ncontrol the distance-dependence of the tensor correlator, are parameterized and determined\nby a two-body energy minimization. A characteristic of the tensor part of realistic NN\ninteractions and thus of tensor correlations is their long range. We are not aiming at a\ndescription of long-range tensor correlations by the unitary transformation, since they are\nstrongly system-dependent. In contrast to the deuteron, the long-range tensor correlations\n\n\f5\nin heavier nuclei will be largely screened. During the determination of the tensor correlators\nwe therefore constrain the range or volume of \u03b8(r) given by\nZ\n(ST )\nI\u03b8\n= dr r 2 \u03b8(r).\n\n(2)\n(S=1,T =0)\n\nIn the present study, we use the optimal tensor correlators for I\u03b8\n\n= 0.07, 0.08,\n\nand 0.09 fm3 and investigate the effect on the global properties of collective excitation\nphenomena. No tensor correlator is employed in the (S = 1, T = 1)-channel, because\nthere the tensor interaction is rather weak. It has been shown within no-core shell model\n(10)\n\ncalculations that for I\u03b8\n\n= 0.09 fm3 the experimental binding energies for A \u2264 4 are\n\nreproduced quite well [14].\nThe correlated operators constructed by the unitary transformation contain irreducible\ncontributions, not only of one-body and two-body operators, but also higher n-body parts.\nThis cluster expansion is truncated after the two-body level, leading to the so-called twobody approximation. In previous studies it has been verified that higher order contributions\ndue to central correlations can be neglected in the description of nuclear structure properties\n[13]. For the tensor correlators the range constraint is important for the validity of the twobody approximation. The size of residual three-body and higher order contributions was\nestimated in [14].\nStarting from the uncorrelated Hamiltonian for the A-body system, consisting of the\nkinetic energy operator and the bare AV18 potential, the central and tensor correlation\noperators are employed to construct the correlated Hamiltonian in the two-body approximation. Therein the one-body contributions come only from the uncorrelated kinetic energy,\nwhile two-body contributions arise from the correlated kinetic energy and the correlated potential, which together constitute the low-momentum correlated interaction VUCOM [13, 14].\nThe VUCOM interaction can directly be employed in the HF model to determine the singleparticle wave functions and energies. By using the expansion in the harmonic oscillator\nbasis, the HF equations are solved in a self-consistent way, with restrictions on the maximal value of the major shell quantum number Nmax = 12, and maximal orbital angular\nmomentum quantum number lmax = 8.\nIn Fig. 1 the UCOM-HF single-nucleon spectra are displayed for the case of 40 Ca. The cal(10)\n\nculations are based on the correlated Argonne V18 interaction, with the constraint I\u03b8 =0.09\nfm3 for the correlation volume of the tensor correlator, Eq. (2). The UCOM-HF energy levels\n\n\f6\nare compared with the HF spectrum obtained with the low-momentum NN potential Vlow\u2212k\n[26], with two standard phenomenological interactions in the nonrelativistic (Skyrme) [27]\nand relativistic (NL3) [28] framework, and with experimental levels [27]. The spectra obtained from the HF model based on realistic NN interactions appear distributed too wide\nin energy. In addition, the HF binding energies and radii are too small compared to the\nexperimental values [13].\nThese deviations can be attributed to several missing pieces in the UCOM-HF description:\n(i) Long-range correlations are not covered by the unitary correlation operators and should\nbe described by the model space, i.e. the available many-body states. The independentparticle states of the HF approach are clearly not able to do so and one has to go beyond the\nmean-field level. In the next section we are going to include long-range correlations due to\ncollective vibrations, by means of RPA. (ii) Three-body forces, either genuine or induced by\nthe unitary transformation, generally play a role for the quantitative description of nuclear\nstructure. These are not included in the present study. Hence the results presented here\nwill provide some information on their importance.\n\nIII.\n\nRANDOM-PHASE APPROXIMATION BASED ON THE VUCOM\n\nThe HF description of the nuclear ground state is to some extent oversimplified, and\ncorrelation effects going beyond mean-field should be included. Giant resonances may have\nsome influence on the nuclear binding energies [17], and it is known that correlations due to\nsurface vibrations have a considerable influence on the ground state densities [33]. In this\nsection, we will employ an RPA model based on the UCOM Hamiltonian (UCOM-RPA) to\nevaluate the ground state correlations due to collective vibrations and to study the properties\nof such excitations themselves.\nThe UCOM-HF single-particle states are used for the construction of the ph configuration\nspace for the RPA model. One of the standard approaches to derive the RPA equations is\nthe equation of motion method with the quasiboson approximation [16], resulting in the\neigenvalue problem formulated as a set of coupled equations for the forward and backward\nk,JM\nk,JM\namplitudes, Xph\nand Yph\nrespectively,\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nAJ B J\nX k,JM\n1 0\nX k,JM\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\uf8ed\n\uf8f8 = \u03c9k \uf8ed\n\uf8f8\uf8ed\n\uf8f8 .\n\u2217J\n\u2217J\nk,JM\nk,JM\nB A\nY\n0 \u22121\nY\n\n(3)\n\n\f7\nThe eigenvalues \u03c9k correspond to RPA excitation energies and the RPA matrices are given\nby,\nh\u0002\n\u0003 JM + i\n|\u03c6i\nAJM\n,\nH\nUCOM , Ap\u2032 h\u2032\nph\n\u0002\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0003\nJ\u2212M J\u2212M\n= \u2212h\u03c6| AJM\nAp\u2032 h\u2032 |\u03c6i,\nph , HUCOM , (\u22121)\n\nAJphp\u2032h\u2032 = h\u03c6|\n\n(4)\n\nJ\nBphp\n\u2032 h\u2032\n\n(5)\n\n+\n\nwhere the operator AJM\n(AJM\nph\nph ) creates (annihilates) a ph state of angular momentum JM.\nWe consistently use the intrinsic Hamiltonian HUCOM = T \u2212 Tcm + VUCOM , i.e., the center\nof mass contribution to the kinetic energy is subtracted on the operator level. The Coulomb\ninteraction is included explicitly.\nAn essential property of the present model is that it is fully self-consistent, i.e. the same\ncorrelated realistic NN interaction VUCOM is used in the HF equations that determine the\nsingle-particle basis, and in the RPA residual interaction entering the calculation of the\nRPA matrices. This essential property of our model ensures that RPA amplitudes do not\ncontain spurious components associated with the center-of-mass translational motion. We\nhave verified that the spurious 1\u2212 state is properly decoupled from the physical excitation\nstates. We also have examined, for closed-shell nuclei across the nuclide chart, that the\nUCOM-RPA model essentially exhausts the isoscalar energy-weighted sum rules [16] with\nmaximal discrepancies of \u00b1 3%.\nIn the present study, the correlation energies are evaluated within the UCOM-RPA framework,\n\u03b4E = \u2212\n\nX\nk,J\n\n(2J + 1)~\u03c9kJ\n\nX\n\nk,J 2\n|Yph\n|,\n\n(6)\n\nph\n\nk,J\nby using the RPA eigenvalues \u03c9kJ , and backward-going amplitudes Yph\n. Both, the natural\n\n\u03c0 = (\u22121)J and unnatural parity \u03c0 = (\u22121)J+1 excitations are included, in the range of\nJ \u03c0 = 0\u00b1 \u2212 10\u00b1 . The HF binding energies together with RPA correlations due to collective\nexcitations are shown in Fig. 2 for several closed-shell nuclei. The HF binding energies\nand UCOM-RPA correlations are calculated in a consistent way by using the correlated\n(10)\n\nAV18 interaction for various ranges of the tensor correlator, constrained by I\u03b8 =0.07, 0.08,\nand 0.09 fm3 . In general, the tensor correlator with longer range provides stronger binding\nboth on the HF level and when the correlations are taken into account. In comparison\nwith the experimental binding energies [34], the present model with full implementation of\nRPA correlations seems to favor the tensor correlator with shorter range. However, one\n\n\f8\nshould keep in mind that the method used to evaluate the correlation energy, Eq. (6), is\nnot free of over-counting [35] and therefore the correlation effects are overestimated. Within\nmany-body perturbation theory or configuration interaction calculations, the longer ranged\ncorrelator provides a very good agreement with experimental binding energies for all nuclei\nin accord with the no-core shell model calculations discussed in [14].\nBy examining the electric transition strength, one can also study the properties of the correlated interaction VUCOM . This is exemplified in Fig. 3, where the UCOM-RPA strength\ndistributions, corresponding to the isoscalar giant monopole resonance (ISGMR) are displayed for the correlated AV18 interaction with different restrictions on the range of the\n(10)\n\ntensor correlator, I\u03b8 =0.07, 0.08, and 0.09 fm3 . For the lighter nuclei\nthe ISGMR is fragmented into two-three peaks, whereas for\n\n90\n\nZr,\n\n132\n\n16\n\nO,\n\n40\n\nSn, and\n\nCa, and\n208\n\n48\n\nCa,\n\nPb the IS-\n\nGMR is strongly collective, resulting essentially in a single peak. For a comparison, the\nmonopole response is also calculated in the framework of relativistic RPA based on effective\nLagrangian with density-dependent meson-nucleon vertex functions, with DD-ME1 interaction (more details are given in Sec. IV). In addition, the calculated ISGMR strength\ndistributions are compared with the nonrelativistic RPA based on Woods-Saxon potential\nand G-matrix formalism [32], and with experimental data from (\u03b1, \u03b1) [29, 30] and (3 He,3 He)\nscattering [31]. One can observe that a decrease of the range of the tensor correlator systematically pushes the transition strength towards lower energies. In particular, by decreasing\n(10)\n\nthe range of the tensor correlator, i.e. its constraint I\u03b8 =0.09 fm3 towards 0.07 fm3 , the\nexcitation energy of ISGMR lowers by \u22484 MeV. This means that by varying the range of\nthe tensor correlator, one can effectively control the impact of the missing correlations on\nthe transition strength of ISGMR.\n\nIV.\n\nPROTON PYGMY DIPOLE RESONANCE IN THE RELATIVISTIC QRPA\n\nIn this section we discuss recent developments regarding the response of nuclei far from\n\u03b2-stability. One of the major challenges in this region is the understanding of soft modes\nof excitations which involve loosely bound nucleons. In particular, in neutron-rich nuclei,\nnucleons from the neutron skin may give rise to a soft low-energy dipole mode known as the\npygmy dipole resonance (PDR) [36, 37, 38]. The structure of nuclei on the proton-rich side\nis equally important for many aspects of the underlying many-body problem and effective\n\n\f9\nnuclear interactions. In a recent relativistic QRPA study, it has been predicted that in nuclei\nwith proton excess one could expect the appearance of a proton PDR mode where loosely\nbound protons vibrate against the rest of the nucleons [24, 39]. The relativistic QRPA [21]\nis formulated in the canonical single-nucleon basis of the relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov\n(RHB) model and is fully self-consistent. For the interaction in the particle-hole channel\neffective Lagrangians with nonlinear meson self-interactions or density-dependent mesonnucleon couplings are used [40], and pairing correlations are described by the pairing part of\nthe finite-range Gogny interaction [2]. The parameters of the effective relativistic interaction\nhave been adjusted to properties of nuclear matter and to binding energies, charge radii, and\ndifferences between neutron and proton radii of spherical nuclei [40]. In the small-amplitude\nlimit, the RQRPA equations are derived from the equation of motion for the generalized\nnucleon density [21]. The RQRPA configuration space is constructed from standard (2qp)\npairs, but one also needs to include transitions to the unoccupied states from the Dirac sea\n[3, 42].\nThe RQRPA dipole strength distributions for N=20 isotones, displayed in Fig. 4, are\ndominated by the isovector giant dipole resonances (GDR) at \u2248 20 MeV excitation energy.\nWith the increase of the number of protons, low-lying dipole strength appears in the region\nbelow the GDR and, for 44 Cr and 46 Fe, a pronounced low-energy peak is found at \u2248 10 MeV\nexcitation energy. In the lower panel of Fig. 4 we plot the proton and neutron transition\ndensities for the peaks at 10.15 MeV in\n\n44\n\nCr and 9.44 MeV in\n\nthe transition densities of the GDR state at 18.78 MeV in\n\n46\n\n46\n\nFe, and compare them with\n\nFe. Obviously the dynamics\n\nof the two low-energy peaks is very different from that of the isovector GDR: the proton\nand neutron transition densities are in phase in the nuclear interior and there is very small\ncontribution from the neutrons in the surface region. By exploring the RQRPA amplitudes,\nwe note that, rather than a single proton 2qp excitation, the low-lying states are characterized\nby a superposition of a number of mainly proton 2qp configurations. The low-lying state\ndoes not belong to statistical E1 excitations sitting on the tail of the GDR, but represents\na fundamental mode of excitation: the proton electric pygmy dipole resonance (PDR).\n\n\f10\nV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn the present study, a fully self-consistent RPA model is constructed in the singlenucleon Hartree-Fock basis, by using correlated realistic NN interactions obtained within the\nUCOM framework. It is shown that the VUCOM interaction generates a strongly collective\nISGMR mode, whose energy is sensitive to the range of the tensor correlator. The UCOMRPA correlations due to collective vibrations provide important contributions to the nuclear\nbinding energies. In addition, by employing the fully self-consistent relativistic quasiparticle\nRPA, it is indicated that the nuclei towards the proton drip-line are characterized by the\nappearance of the proton pygmy dipole resonance, i.e. an exotic mode where loosely bound\nprotons oscillate against the isospin-saturated proton-neutron core.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work has been supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) under\ncontract SFB 634.\n\n[1] D.
