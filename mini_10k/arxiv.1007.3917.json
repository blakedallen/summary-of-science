The NH geometry (the\nproduct space AdS2 \u00d7S 2 , known as Bertotti-Robinson solution, in the typical asymptotically-flat\ncases) contains a great deal of information about the constituents of the original solution and is\namenable to a dual description by a gauge theory living in the boundary of the AdS2 space. In\nparticular, the radius of the S 2 factor of the NH geometry, which corresponds to a horizon with\nthe same topology, is directly related to the entropy. The sufficiency of the NH description to\ndescribe the black-hole entropy, independently of the asymptotic behavior of the solution, is a\nconsequence of the attractor mechanism [1].\nThe topology of the spatial factor of the NH solution (S 2 in the above example) coincides\nwith that of the spatial sections of the black-hole horizon. In the 4-dimensional, asymptotically\nflat (vanishing cosmological constant) case, a classical theorem by Hawking [2]3 . and the \"topological censorship theorem\" of Ref. [4] constrain that topology to be that of S 2 . However, black\nholes with event horizons topologically inequivalent to S 2 have been discovered in dimensions\nhigher than four [5, 6]4 ; in four dimensions and in presence of a negative cosmological constant\ntopological black holes with horizons which are Riemann surfaces or arbitrary genus have also\nbeen constructed [8].\nThe requirement of unbroken supersymmetry of the NH solution strongly constrains the possible NH geometries and horizon topologies. In Ref. [9] Reall showed that, in 5-dimensional\nsupergravity, supersymmetry only allows three possible horizon topologies: T 3 , S 1 \u00d7 S 2 (the\ntopology of the supersymmetric black ring of Ref. [6]) and (possibly a quotient of) a homogeneously squashed S 3 . On the other hand, in Ref. [10] it was shown that only the genus bigger than\none horizons may have unbroken supersymmetry in minimal gauged N = 2 d = 4 supergravity.\nIn a recent paper [11] Gutowski and Papadopoulos have studied possible topologies of supersymmetric horizons of black hole solutions of N = 1, d = 4 supergravity finding that, regardless\nof the supersymmetry properties of the complete black-hole solution5, if the horizon is compact\nand supersymmetric (i.e. if the NH geometry is), then its constant time sections have to be, topologically, tori. Our purpose in this note is to investigate possible simple realizations of these NH\ngeometries in simple N = 1, d = 4 supergravity theories.\nSince, in order to have topological black hole solutions, we need a negative cosmological\nconstant, we should consider a N = 1, d = 4 theory providing a minimal supersymmetric\nembedding of the cosmological Einstein-Maxwell (EM-\u039b) theory\nZ\np\nS = dx4 |g| {R \u2212 F 2 \u2212 \u039b} ,\n(1)\nfor negative (aDS) cosmological constant \u039b. However, just to be general (which will prove\nfortunate in he end), we are also going to consider another N = 1, d = 4 supergravity theory\n3\n\nA recent paper with references on the generalization of this theorem to higher dimensions and non-vanishing\ncosmological constant is [3].\n4\nFor a recent review with references, see [7].\n5\nThere are no supersymmetric asymptotically flat black-hole solutions in N = 1, d = 4 supergravities [12, 13].\nNo supersymmetric black holes with other asymptotic behaviors are known, either.\n\n2\n\n\fproviding a supersymmetric embedding of EM-\u039b for positive (DS) cosmological constant.\nThe bosonic equations of motion of these two theories take the common form\n\nR\u03bc\u03bd =\n\n\u0002\n\u039b\ng\u03bc\u03bd + 2 F\u03bc \u03c1 F\u03bd\u03c1 \u2212\n2\n\n1\n4\n\n\u0003\ng\u03bc\u03bd F 2 ,\n\nd\u22c6F = 0 .\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nThe two theories that we are going to consider have the same matter content: an Abelian vector\nsupermultiplet {A\u03bc , \u03bb} coupled to the N = 1, d = 4 supergravity multiplet {ea \u03bc , \u03c8\u03bc }. The first\ntheory, constructed by Townsend in Ref. [16], has, in more modern parlance, a constant superpotential W = g/2 which gives a negative cosmological constant \u039b = \u22128g 2 and possesses a\nmaximally supersymmetric aDS4 solution. In the second theory, constructed by Freedman in\nRef. [17], the Abelian vector field is used to gauge the global U(1) R-symmetry via a FayetIliopoulos term which gives a positive cosmological constant \u039b = +g 2/2 where g is the gauge\ncoupling constant. These two possibilities cannot be combined because the constant superpotential breaks R-symmetry.\nAlthough the bosonic sectors of these two theories are identical, up to the sign of the cosmological constant, the couplings of the fermionic sectors and the supersymmetry transformations\nare substantially different, which results in very different supersymmetric configurations even\nthough all the Killing spinors of the supersymmetric configurations of any N = 1, d = 4 supergravity must satisfy the condition [12, 13]\n\u03b3 u\u01eb = 0 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere u is a null coordinate, or, equivalently\n\u03b3 01 \u01eb = \u00b1\u01eb .\n\n(5)\n\n1 Supersymmetry of Pleba\u0144ski-Hacyan geometries\nWe are going to consider configurations whose metric is the direct product of two 2-dimensional\nsubspaces of constant curvature, the first one parametrized by the first two (timelike and spacelike) coordinates and the second one parametrized by the last two (spacelike) coordinates. This\ngeneric class of solutions to EM-\u039b was first obtained by Pleba\u0144ski & Hacyan in Ref. [14], and\nincludes as special cases the Bertotti-Robinson solution (aDS2 \u00d7 S 2 ) and the Nariai universe\n(DS2 \u00d7 S 2 ) [15], whose discovery predates the work [14].\nThe geometry of the purely spacelike 2-dimensional subspace is expected to correspond to\nthat of the constant-time sections of a black-hole horizon. The Maxwell field will have nonvanishing components F01 = \u03b1 and F23 = \u03b2, where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are real constants (that is: the\ncomponents of the Maxwell field are proportional to the volume 2-forms of the two subspaces).\nWe will make this more precise Ansatz later on.\n3\n\n\f1.1 N = 1, d = 4 Supergravity with constant superpotential\nAs was mentioned before, the minimal version of this theory was constructed by Townsend in\nRef. [16] and when coupled to a vector multiplet corresponds to a supersymmetric version of the\nEM-\u039b theory with the cosmological constant \u039b = \u22128g 2 being of the anti-De Sitter kind. The\nsupersymmetry transformations of the fermions for vanishing fermions are6\n0 = \u03b4\u01eb \u03c8\u03bc = \u2207\u03bc \u01eb + 2i g\u03b3\u03bc\u01eb\u2217 ,\n\n(6)\n\n0 = 2\u03b4\u01eb \u03bb = 6 F + \u01eb ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u2207 is the general and Lorentz-covariant derivative.\nThat this theory does not admit supersymmetric solution of the type we are after is easily\ndeduced by calculating the integrability condition for Eq. (6):\n\u0002\n\n\u0003\n/ \u03bc\u03bd + g 2\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd \u01eb = 0 .\nR\n\n(8)\n\n/ 02 = 0, which\nThe split into 2-dimensional spaces of constant curvature, implies that e.g. R\nimmediately implies that \u01eb = 0, whence no supersymmetric PH solutions exist.\n\n1.2 Minimal gauged N = 1, d = 4 supergravity\nThis N = 1 d = 4 theory was constructed by Freedman in Ref. [17] and has the curiosity that it\ncorresponds to supergravity theory with a De Sitter-like cosmological constant (\u039b = g 2 /2). The\nrelevant supersymmetry transformations for vanishing fermions are\n0 = \u03b4\u01eb \u03c8\u03bc =\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2207\u03bc + 2i gA\u03bc \u01eb ,\n\n(9)\n\ng \u01eb.\n\n(10)\n\nh\n+\n0 = \u03b4\u01eb \u03bb = F/ \u2212\n\ni\n2\n\ni\n\nDe Sitter spacetime is a solution of the theory but breaks all supersymmetries.\nThe Killing spinor equation (10) only admits solutions for our Ansatz if \u03b1 = 0 and\n\u03b2 = \u00b1g/2\n\nand\n\n\u0002\n\n\u0003\n1 \u00b1 i\u03b3 23 \u01eb = 0 ,\n\n(11)\n\nso that we are dealing with a purely magnetic configuration.\nThe integrability condition of the Killing spinor equation (9) reads\n\u0002\n\n\u0003\n/ \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 ig F\u03bc\u03bd \u01eb = 0 .\nR\n\n(12)\n\n6\nFor clarity's sake we mention that we are using a normalized version of the slash, i.e. for the 2-form F we have\n/\n2F \u2261 Fab \u03b3 ab .\n\n4\n\n\fThe product structure of the metric that we have assumed indicates that the first factor must be\nflat 2-dimensional Minkowski spacetime and the second a 2-sphere whose curvature is related to\n\u03b2 and, therefore, to g.\nAt this point a more precise form for the Ansatz becomes necessary: using standard spherical\ncoordinates for the 2-sphere we write\nds2 = dt2 \u2212 dx2 \u2212 R2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ) ,\n\n(13)\n\n2\n\nA\u03c6 = \u2212\u03b2 R cos \u03b8 .\nThe non-vanishing components of the Ricci and Maxwell field strength tensors are, in the obvious\ntetrad basis\n1\n,\nF23 = \u03b2 .\n(14)\nR2\nThe Maxwell equations are automatically solved as the field strength is an invariant 2-form\non a symmetric space; the Einstein equations are solved if\nR22 = R33 = \u2212\n\nR2 =\n\ng2\n+ \u03b22 ,\n4\n\n(15)\n\nwhich due to Eq. (11) implies:\nR =\n\n\u221a\n\n2/g .\n\n(16)\n\nIn order to finish the analysis we need to solve the Killing spinor equations (9); the 0, 1, 2\ncomponents are trivial and are solved for any t, x and \u03b8 independent spinor. The last component\nis also trivially satisfied once we take into account the following relation between the spin and\nthe gauge connections A3 = \u00b1 g \u22121 \u03c9323 and use the projection in Eq. (11).\nIn conclusion we found a half-BPS solution to Freedman's gauged N = 1 d = 4 supergravity\nthat is purely magnetic and whose geometry is R1,1 \u00d7 S 2 . The obvious question then is: can this\ngeometry be the NH limit of a black hole? A first naive worrisome point is about the occurrence\nof the R1,1 factor in the NH geometry, as the usual one of supersymmetric black holes would\nnot give rise to R1,1 but rather to aDS2 . But, as said, this is a naive preoccupation as, following\nGutowski & Papadopoulos, we are asking for the NH-geometry to be supersymmetric and not\nthe complete solution. If we then couple this to the fact that the NH geometry of black holes\nwith non-vanishing temperature, such a Schwarzschild's, leads to a 2-dimensional Rindler space\nwhich is locally isometric to R1,1 , the preoccupation should cease to exist. So in order to find\nthe candidate black hole whose NH-limit gives rise to the supersymmetric solution, we should\nanalyze the NH-limits of magnetically-charged black holes with spherical topology in De Sitter\nspaces.\n\n2 Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m-De Sitter black holes\nThe Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m-De Sitter (RNDS) black holes can be written in standard coordinates as\n5\n\n\fFigure 1: A plot of the values of M and Z for which the RNDS black holes exist.

As is paramount from the figure M and\n|Z| are bounded by maximal values that in our normalization of \u039b are given by\n\u221a\n1\n1\n2\n2 2\n2\nand Zcrit\n=\n= 2 .\n(20)\nMcrit = \u221a =\n3g\n2\u039b\ng\n3 \u039b\nA point in the grey area corresponds to a black hole with three horizons, namely an inner one at\nr = ri , an outer one at r = ro and a cosmological horizon at r = rc , the nomenclature deriving\nfrom the fact that 0 < ri < ro < rc . Furthermore, all these horizons are warm in the sense\nthat they correspond to single zeroes of f , whence one can associate a temperature to at least the\nouter and the cosmological horizon.7\nThe left boundary corresponds to those black holes for which the inner and the outer horizon\ncoincide 0 < ri = ro < rc , implying that this coincident horizon, but not the cosmological\nhorizon, has zero temperature: these black holes are called cold black holes. The right boundary\ncorresponds to the situation where the outer and the cosmological horizons coincide 0 < ri <\n7\n\nAs is well-known by expanding f in Eq. (19) around the horizon location r = rH as f = (r \u2212 rH ) h(r) with\nh being regular at rH , one finds that the NH geometry is that of a Rindler space of temperature T = h(rH )/(4\u03c0)\ntimes a 2-sphere of radius rH .\n\n6\n\n\fro = rc and are also cold black holes; they receive the name Nariai black holes. The intersection\nof these two boundaries, corresponding to the pair (Mcrit , Zcrit), for which all three horizons\ncoincide, goes by the name ultracold black hole [18].\nThis small discussion then brings us to the question: How are we to identify the RNDS\nblack-hole solution whose NH limit gives us the supersymmetric Pleba\u0144ski-Hacyan solution?\nThe answer is simple: by looking at the NH limit of the gauge field! First of all, a non-zero Q\nwould lead to a non-zero F01 so we will take Q = 0. The NH limit of the vector field strength\nfor a horizon located at r = rH is\nF = d(\u2212P cos \u03b8 d\u03c6) = P d\u03b8 \u2227 sin \u03b8d\u03c6 \u2212\u2192\n\nP 2\ne \u2227 e3 ,\n2\nrH\n\n(21)\n\n2\nand leads to the identification that P = \u03b2 rH\n. Seeing that the value of \u03b2 for the supersymmetric\nsolution is given in Eq. (11) and that rH is effectively the radius of the 2-sphere in the NH limit,\nEq. (16), we can deduce that our candidate black hole must have\n\u221a !2\ng\n2\n2\n= \u00b11/g ,\n(22)\nP = \u03b2 rH\n= \u00b1\n2\ng\n\nimplying that our candidate black hole is none other than the ultracold black hole.\nThis poses, however, an immediate problem, one already pointed out by Romans [18]: as the\nhorizon of the ultracold black hole corresponds to a triple zero of the function f in Eq. (19), the\nnaive NH limit does not give as NH geometry Rindler space times S 2 but a different one, one\nthat is not even a solution to the equations of motion: the reason for this is that in this case the\nusual procedure of zooming in does not conform to Geroch's criteria of limiting spaces [19].\nThere is an alternative limiting procedure that does give rise to the desired result [20, 21]\nwhich basically consists in going first to the cold limit in which f (r) has a double zero and then\ntaking the NH limit simultaneously with the ultracold limit in a particular way. The result is the\nsupersymmetric Pleba\u0144ski-Hacyan solution8 which can, therefore, be identified as the NH limit\nof the ultracold, purely magnetic, RNDS black hole.\n\n3 Conclusions\nIn this letter we have tried to find simple examples of supersymmetric horizons in N = 1, d = 4\nsupergravity theories motivated by the prediction made in Ref. [11] that, if any, their spatial\nsections would always be topologically equivalent to tori. We have focused on two N = 1, d =\n4 theories (Freedman's and Townsend's) whose bosonic sector is the cosmological EinsteinMaxwell theory with positive and negative cosmological constant, respectively, and on candidate\n8\nNotice that we can arrive at the same result in a more pedestrian way by taking the NH limit of a warm or a\ncold horizon in a first step and then taking the ultracold limit in a second step. In the first case, we arrive at the\nNH geometry Rindler2 \u00d7 S 2 in the first step and then adjust the physical parameters to those of the supersymmetric\nPH solution in the second. In the second case, we arrive to the NH geometry aDS2 \u00d7 S 2 in the first step while the\nsecond step flattens out the aDS2 factor because the ultracold limit is the limit of infinite aDS radius. We get the\nsame result in all cases.\n\n7\n\n\fnear-horizon geometries which are the direct product of two 2-dimensional spaces of constant\ncurvature. We have shown that none of our candidates is supersymmetric in Townsend's theory\n(\u039b < 0) but we have also shown that one of them, with the geometry Minkowski2 \u00d7 S 2 is\nactually supersymmetric in Freedman's (\u039b > 0). Then we have shown that this supersymmetric\nsolution is the NH limit of the ultracold RNDS black-hole solution when the NH limit is correctly\ncomputed, which means that, even though no RNDS black-hole solution is supersymmetric, the\nhorizon of the ultracold one, which has the topology of S 2 , is. We can also say that the nonsupersymmetric ultracold RNDS black hole solution interpolates between non-supersymmetric\nDS spacetime at infinity and a half-supersymmetric Pleba\u0144ski-Hacyan solution at the horizon.\nThis result is a clear counterexample for the generic prediction of Ref. [11]. The reason why\nour spherically-symmetric NH geometry was missed is, as far as we can see, that the analysis\nmade in that reference is based on a gravitino Killing spinor equation that is not general enough,\nand in particular does not include Freedman's theory.\nOf course, our results do not imply that these are the only possible supersymmetric NH\ngeometries nor that Freedman's theory and its generalizations are the only possible N = 1, d = 4\nsupergravities in which supersymmetric NH geometries can be found.\nAt this moment we do not have a clear physical interpretation of this result. We can only stress\nthe fact that the supersymmetric solution has mass and magnetic charge which are extremized\nfor a given value of the cosmological/coupling constant. Furthermore, we would like to point out\nthat, while Townsend's theory is sometimes called N = 1, d = 4, aDS supergravity, Freedman's\n(studied, for instance, in Refs. [22, 23]) is very different from a naive (and inconsistent) N =\n1, d = 4, DS supergravity and can be embedded in string theory [24].\nAs a final comment let us point out that a fake version of Freedman's gauged supergravity can\nbe constructed and the existence of fake-supersymmetric NH-geometries can be studied, which\nshows that indeed there is a fake-supersymmetric aDS2 \u00d7\u03a32g>1 solution. One can then also show\nthat there is no aDS-black hole which has this NH-geometry.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work has been supported in part by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Education grants\nFPA2006-00783 and FPA2009-07692, a Ram\u00f3n y Cajal fellowship RYC-2009-05014, the Comunidad de Madrid grant HEPHACOS S2009ESP-1473, the Princip\u00e1u d'Asturies grant IB09069 and the Spanish Consolider-Ingenio 2010 program CPAN CSD2007-00042.
