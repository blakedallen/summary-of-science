Introduction\nThe recent experimental advances in the creation and manipulation of atomic BoseEinstein condensates are suggesting these systems as ideal candidates where to\n\n\fAcoustic white holes in atomic BECs\n\n2\n\nexperimentally address fundamental questions in quantum hydrodynamics [1]. In\nparticular, a lot of attention has been devoted to configurations showing regions of\nsuper-sonic flow, where the dynamics is the richest and quantum effects should be\neasiest to observe. Among the most remarkable recent observations, we may mention\nthe emission of a wake of Bogoliubov phonons by a moving defect via an analog of\nthe C\u0306erenkov effect [2], the shedding of solitons in a one-dimensional configuration [3],\nthe onset of dynamical instabilities in the periodic potential of optical lattices [4]. In\nthe meanwhile, theoretical investigations have addressed general questions about the\nstability of superflow [5] and have identified the mechanisms underlying the shedding of\nsolitons [6] and vortices [7]. Analytical aspects of the one-dimensional flow have been\nalso investigated in detail [8]. Most of this physics is accurately described within a meanfield approach, where the dynamics of the Bose-condensed atomic cloud is described in\nterms of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for the condensate wavefunction [1, 9].\nIn the wake of the formal analogy [10, 11] between the propagation of quantum\nfields on a curved space-time background [12] and the propagation of sound on\ninhomogeneously moving fluids, a strong interest is presently being devoted to the\nquantum features of the condensate hydrodynamics. A most intriguing prediction\nconcerns the emission of correlated pairs of phonons by the horizon of an acoustic\nblack hole configuration via a mechanism which is a condensed-matter analog of the\nwell-celebrated Hawking radiation from gravitational black holes [13]. Following the\nproposal of [14], the key signature of this effect was identified in the correlation function\nof density fluctuations: the correlation between the Hawking phonon and the partner\nfalling into the black hole results in a peculiar, tongue-shaped feature in the correlation\npattern. This prediction was confirmed in an ab initio numerical simulation of the\ndynamics of an atomic BEC [15]. A first experimental attempt to create an acoustic\nblack hole in an atomic condensate was reported in [16].\nAs we schematically show in Fig.1, an acoustic white hole configuration is obtained\nby simply reversing the direction of flow of a black hole one: atoms go from an upstream,\ninner region where the flow is super-sonic to a downstream, external region where\nthe flow is sub-sonic: within a naive hydrodynamic picture, dragging by the moving\ncondensate forbids low-energy phonons from crossing the horizon and penetrating the\ninner region of the white hole. Questions about the stability of such acoustic white\nhole configurations has lately attracted a lot of interest, and different answers have been\nproposed to this problem, ranging from instability [17], to stability [18], to intermediate\nbehaviours depending on boundary conditions [20]. Issues related to the quantum\nemission of phonons by configurations involving white hole horizons have been addressed\nin [18, 19, 21, 22].\nThe present paper reports a comprehensive theoretical investigation of the physical\nproperties of acoustic white holes in atomic Bose condensates. Focussing our attention\non a specific, yet realistic configuration which is most suitable to numerical and\nanalytical study, we address the problem of the dynamical stability of white hole\nconfigurations and then the physical properties of the white hole radiation emitted by\n\n\fAcoustic white holes in atomic BECs\n\n3\n\nthe horizon. In order to be able to safely isolate the dynamics of the white hole horizon\nfrom spurious effects due to the finite size and/or the multiply connected geometry of the\nsystem [23], all numerical calculations have been performed using absorbing boundary\nconditions for the Bogoliubov phonons so to model the most relevant situation of an\ninfinitely long condensate.\nIn Sec.2 we introduce the physical system and we discuss the main features of the\ndispersion of Bogoliubov excitations in respectively the super- and sub-sonic regions:\nthis will be the essential ingredient to physically understand the numerical observations\nthat are presented in the following of the paper. Among the different possible choices of\nthe density and flow velocity pattern that result in a white hole horizon, we concentrate\nour attention on a configuration that appears most robust against spurious effects.\nThe dynamical stability of the white hole configuration is assessed in Sec.3, where\nthe scattering of a phonon wavepacket on the white hole horizon is studied by means\nof the Gross-Pitaevskii equation of mean-field theory. In addition to the reflected\nwavepacket in the outward direction, a pair of short wavelength wavepackets penetrate\ninside the white hole: as a consequence of the strong blue shift experienced while\napproaching the horizon, low energy hydrodynamic modes are in fact transformed\ninto high-momentum single particle excitations that are able to enter the white hole.\nOne of the two wavepackets consists of negative-norm Bogoliubov modes and results\nfrom the same mixing of positive and negative norm modes that underlies Hawking\nradiation. Dynamical stability of the configuration is demonstrated by the fact that\nno exponentially growing deformation of the horizon develops under the effect of the\nincident wavepacket \u2021. The only visible back-action effect consists of the BogoliubovC\u0306erenkov emission of zero-frequency phonons [2] in the upstream direction by the slight\ndeformation of the horizon; a specific discussion of this feature is given in Sec.3.2. As\na function of time, the amplitude of this pattern eventually tends to a finite amplitude\nvalue, roughly proportional to the square of the incident wavepacket amplitude.\nThe effect of quantum fluctuations is studied in Sec.4 using the same truncated\nWigner method as in [15]. In analogy to what was done for acoustic black holes, our\nkey observable is the correlation function of density fluctuations. Several characteristic\nfeatures are identified and related to the correlated emission of phonon pairs by the\nwhite hole horizon into different pairs of modes. In spite of some similarities with the\nHawking emission from black holes, the physical properties of the emission turn out\nto be significantly different: for this reason, we have chosen to refer to it under the\ndifferent name of white hole emission. While Hawking radiation mostly consists of lowk excitations, the phonons that are emitted into the white hole have a large momentum\ncomparable to the healing length of the condensate; furthemore, the checkerboard\npattern that appears in the correlation function for points located inside the white\nhole keeps growing in time with a characteristic logarithmic or linear law depending on\n\u2021 A similar procedure for more complex black hole/white hole configurations has confirmed the black\nhole laser phenomenon [21, 24], i.e. the onset of an exponentially growing perturbation of the density\nprofile. This will be the subject of a forthcoming publication.\n\n\fAcoustic white holes in atomic BECs\n\n4\n\nthe initial temperature. This is to be contrasted to the late-time stationary state of\nHawking radiation from black holes.\nAn analytical understanding of the white hole radiation is developed in Sec.5 based\non the Bogoliubov theory of dilute Bose Einstein condensates within the step-like horizon\napproximation of [25]. Dynamical stability of the white hole configuration is assessed by\nchecking that complex frequency eigenmodes of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations are\nindeed absent. A theory of quantum fluctuations is developed in terms of the S-matrix\ndescribing phonon scattering on the white hole horizon. This provides an analytical\nexpression for the spectral distribution of the white hole emission: in contrast to the\nthermal character of Hawking radiation from black holes, the phonons that are emitted\noutside the white hole have a flat spectral distribution. The same approach is then used\nto evaluate the different contributions to the correlation pattern: the resulting analytical\nexpressions reproduce in a fairly accurate way all the features that are observed in\nthe numerical calculations. The steady growth in time of the checkerboard pattern is\nrelated to an infra-red divergence of the density correlation function at late times: the\nlogarithmic/linear growth is recovered by imposing a suitable infra-red cut-off to the\nintegral. Conclusions are finally drawn in Sec.6.\n2. The physical system and the theoretical model\n\nFigure 1. Left panel: sketch of the acoustic white hole configuration. Right panel:\nsketch of an acoustic black hole configuration. The two configurations are related by\na reversal of the condensate flow speed v0 .\n\nA sketch of the physical system we are considering is shown in the left panel of\nFig.1. An elongated atomic Bose-Einstein condensate is steadily flowing along an atomic\nwaveguide in the x\u0302 direction. A suitable modulation of the confinement potential and/or\nof the atom-atom scattering length creates a white hole horizon at x = 0 separating a\nupstream x < 0 region of super-sonic flow from a downstream x > 0 one of sub-sonic\nflow. In the gravitational analogy [10, 26, 27], the upstream region corresponds to the\ninterior of the white hole, while the downstream region corresponds to the external space.\n\n\fAcoustic white holes in atomic BECs\n\n5\n\nFor comparison, a sketch of the acoustic black hole configuration obtained reversing the\nflow speed is shown in the right panel \u00a7.\nTo simplify the theoretical description, the transverse confinement is assumed to\nbe tight enough for the transverse degrees of freedom to be frozen [1] and the system\ndynamics to be accurately described by a one-dimensional model based on the following\nsecond-quantized Hamiltonian,\nZ\nh ~2\n\u2207\u03a8\u0302\u2020 (x) \u2207\u03a8\u0302(x) + V (x, t) \u03a8\u0302\u2020 (x) \u03a8\u0302(x) +\nH = dx\n2m\ni\ng(x, t) \u2020\n+\n\u03a8\u0302 (x) \u03a8\u0302\u2020 (x) \u03a8\u0302(x) \u03a8\u0302(x) .\n(1)\n2\nHere, \u03a8\u0302(x) and \u03a8\u0302\u2020 (x) are atomic field operators satisfying Bose commutation rules\n[\u03a8\u0302(x), \u03a8\u0302\u2020 (x0 )] = \u03b4(x \u2212 x0 ), m is the atomic mass, V (x) the external potential, and g(x)\nis the effective one-dimensional atom-atom interaction constant [1]. At mean-field level,\nthe condensate dynamics is described by the one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation\n(GPE) [1]\n\u2202\u03c8\n~2 \u2202 2 \u03c8\n=\u2212\n+ V (x, t) \u03c8 + g(x, t) |\u03c8|2 \u03c8\n(2)\n\u2202t\n2m \u2202x2\nfor the macroscopic condensate wavefunction \u03c8. In Sec.3, this equation will be used to\nstudy the propagation of classical perturbations on top of the white hole configurations:\nfull inclusion of the nonlinearity will allow us to study the dynamical stability of\nthe configuration beyond the linearized Bogoliubov theory. In the following Sec.4,\nthe so-called truncated Wigner method will be adopted to go beyond the meanfield approximation underlying (2) and include the effect of quantum and thermal\nfluctuations: these are described in terms of stochastic noise on the initial value of\nthe condensate wavefunction, which then evolves according to the same GPE (2).\nExpectation values of observables are obtained as averages over the stochastic noise.\nWe refer to [15] for a detailed description of the numerical technique.\nFor the sake of simplicity, we shall focus our attention onto a specific configuration\nwhich is most suitable for both analytic and numeric investigation. Initially, the\ncondensate is assumed to have a spatially uniform density n0 and a spatially uniform\nflow speed v0 along the positive x direction. The external potential and the (repulsive)\natom-atom interaction constant are also uniform and equal to respectively V (x) = Vd\nand g(x) = gd > 0. Around t = t0 , a step-like spatial modulation is applied to both the\npotential and the interaction constant by suitably modifying the transverse confinement\npotential and/or the atom-atom scattering length via an external magnetic field tuned\nin the vicinity of a so-called Feshbach resonance [1]: within a short time \u03c3t , V and g in\nthe upstream x < 0 region are brought to their final values Vu and gu , while their values\nin the x > 0 region are kept equal to the initial ones Vd and gd . The transition region\naround x = 0 has a characteristic thickness \u03c3x ; away from it, both V and g quickly tend\nto their asymptotic values Vu,d and gu,d .\ni~\n\n\u00a7 Note that this configuration differs from the one considered in [15, 25] by a simple spatial inversion\n\n\fAcoustic white holes in atomic BECs\n\n6\n\nTo avoid the development of spurious instabilities due to the reflection of Bogoliubov\nexcitations at the edges of the integration box, suitable absorbing boundary conditions\nare implemented for the Bogoliubov modes. In practice, this is done by including a\nrestoring force on the wavefunction that damps out Bogoliubov excitations and brings\nit back to a pure condensate. For this additional term not to interfere with the\nphysics under investigation, it is spatially restricted to small regions at the edges of\nthe integration box which are sufficiently far from the white hole horizon.\nIn order to reduce the impact of competing processes such as back-scattering of\ncondensate atoms and soliton shedding from the potential step [6], the external potential\nV is chosen to exactly compensate the spatial jump in the Hartree interaction energy\n\u03bcu,d = gu,d n0 , i.e.\nVd + \u03bcd = Vu + \u03bcu .\nIn this way, the plane wave\n\u221a\n\u03c8(x, t) = n0 exp[i(k0 x \u2212 \u03c90 t)]\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nwith ~k0 /m = v0 and \u03c90 = ~k02 /2m is for all times a solution of the GPE (2).\nThe white hole configuration that is the subject of the present paper is characterized\nby the chain inequality cu < v0 < cd relating the speed\np of sound in respectively\nthe upstream and downstream asymptotic regions cu,d = \u03bcu,d /m and the (spatially\nuniform) flow speed v0 .

For future use, we have defined \u03a9u,d (k) as the frequencies measured in\nthe upstream and down stream comoving frames at rest with the condensate.\nThe main feature of the white hole configuration consists of the fact that long\nwavelength phonons are forbidden from penetrating into the inner region of the white\nhole. As a consequence of dragging by the super-sonic flow, the group velocity turns\nout to be positive v0 \u00b1 cu > 0 in the laboratory frame for both k > 0 and k < 0\nphonons. This behaviour has to be compared to the black hole case shown in the lower\npanels of Fig.2: in this case, the direction of the condensate flow is reversed and long\nwavelength phonons cannot escape from the inner, super-sonic region. It is however\ncrucial to note that the above black and white hole behaviours are restricted to low-k\nBogoliubov excitations of hydrodynamic nature. Indeed, large-k Bogoliubov excitations\nhave a single particle character and propagate at a faster group velocity. As a result,\nthey are able to propagate in both directions, that is to penetrate into a white hole and\nk Note that this convention differs from the one that is usually adopted in relativity, where the modes\nare labelled according to their left- or right-moving character with respect to the light/sound cone, i.e.\ntheir propagation direction in the frame comoving with the condensate [18, 19].\n\n\fAcoustic white holes in atomic BECs\n\n7\n\nFigure 2. Dispersion of Bogoliubov excitations in the asymptotic regions far away\nfrom the horizon. The labels of the modes indicate the up- or down-stream region with\nrespect to the condensate flow and the in- or out-going direction of their propagation\ndirection (as predicted by their group velocity) with respect to the horizon k. Both the\nfrequency \u03c9(k) and the group velocity of the modes are measured in the laboratory\nframe. Panels (a,b): white hole configuration with a rightward flow v0 > 0, as sketched\nin Fig.1(a).

Black hole\nparameters: |v0 |/cd = 1.5, |v0 |/cu = 0.75.\n\nescape from a black hole. The transition from the hydrodynamic to the single-particle\nregime occurs at a characteristic wavevector given by the inverse of the healing length,\n\u03beu,d = ~/mcu,d .\nIn terms of the gravitational analogy, the point separating the upstream region of\nsuper-sonic cu < v0 flow from the downstream one of sub-sonic v0 < cd flow then acts as\nthe horizon. The k < 0 hydrodynamic phonons that propagate in the sub-sonic region\nin the leftward direction towards the horizon get slowed down as they approach the\nhorizon and can never penetrate into the supersonic region. As a result, they pile up\nin the vicinity of the horizon. Analogously, the group velocity of k < 0 hydrodynamic\nphonons in the super-sonic region tends to zero as the horizon is approached. As a\nresult, they get also piled up on the horizon. The mechanism of this pile-up effect is\ngraphically illustrated in the upper-left panel of Fig.3. As propagation on a stationary\nbackground conserves the phonon frequency \u03c9 in the laboratory frame, the pile-up effect\nis in both cases accompanied by an increase of the wavevector k and a corresponding\nblue shift of the phonon frequency \u03a9(k) in the comoving frame. While this blue-shift\n\n\fAcoustic white holes in atomic BECs\n\n8\n\nFigure 3. Sketch of the mode propagation around a horizon of the white (left panels)\nand black (right panels) hole type.

From the figure, it is\nimmediate to see that under this operation the sign of the group velocity is reversed\nand the in- and out-going character of the modes are exchanged. Another, related\ndifference involves the zero-mode defined by the \u03c9(kZ ) = 0 condition. Such mode only\nexists in the super-sonic region and propagates opposite to the condensate flow: while in\na black hole it propagates towards the horizon, in a white hole it propagates away from\nthe horizon into the inner region. As a result, a perturbation of the white hole horizon\nfrom the Hartree condition (3) may result into the Landau-C\u0306erenkov [2] emission of\nphonons into this zero-energy mode of wavevector\nq\n2m\nkZ = \u2212\nv02 \u2212 c2u\n(6)\n~\n\u22121\ncomparable to the inverse healing length \u03beu,d\nand group velocity\nvZ =\n\nc2u \u2212 v02\nv0\n\n(7)\n\n\fAcoustic white holes in atomic BECs\n\n9\n\nIn the following of the paper, we shall see how this fact plays a crucial role in the physics\nof the white hole configuration.\n3. Dynamical stability of a white hole configuration: mean-field theory\n3.1. Scattering of phonon wavepackets on the horizon\n\nFigure 4. Scattering of a phonon wavepacket on a white hole horizon. The different\npanels show snapshots of the density modulation \u03b4n(x) = n(x) \u2212 n0 at subsequent\ntimes. The insets provide a closer look at some most interesting features. White hole\nparameters as in Fig.2(a,b) with \u03c3x /\u03bed = 0.5. Wavepacket parameters kwp \u03bed = 0.2,\n\u03c3wp /\u03bed = 80. The qualitative behavior remains unchanged if smoother horizons are\nconsidered with \u03c3x /\u03bed \u001d 1.\n\nIn the previous section we have seen that a condensate wavefunction in the plane\nwave form (4) is at all times a solution of the GPE (2). Still, one has to assess the\ndynamical stability of this solution. A simple way to answer to this question consists\nof solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations for the spectrum of linear perturbations\non top of the flowing condensate and looking for complex frequency modes. Pioneering\ncalculations in this direction were performed in [20] for different black and white hole\nconfigurations and for different boundary conditions. A detailed investigation of black\nhole laser instabilities in combined black and white hole configurations was reported\n\n\fAcoustic white holes in atomic BECs\n\n10\n\nin [21, 22]. Application of this method to the white hole case is briefly discussed in\nSec.5.1.\nIn the present Section, we shall follow a different method which consists in studying\nthe wavefunction evolution under the full GPE (2) for an initial condition slightly\nperturbed from the plane wave solution (4). This approach takes into account the\nnonlinear couplings that are neglected in the Bogoliubov theory and that are responsible\nfor interesting back-reaction effects. In all calculations, the white hole is assumed to\nbe already formed well before the experiment is performed so that the condensate\nbackground can be safely considered as a stationary one.\nIn particular, we consider the simple case where a phonon wavepacket modulation\nhas been imprinted on top of the homogeneous solution (4). The wavepacket has a\ncarrier at kwp and a Gaussian envelope of width `wp much larger than the wavelength,\nkwp `wp \u001d 1. Initially, the wavepacket is centered at a position xowp far from the horizon,\n|xowp | \u001d `wp . In wavevector space, the phonon wavepacket has a narrow Gaussian shape\naround kwp of width \u2206kwp = 1/`wp \u001c kwp . The amplitude of the wavepacket is chosen to\nbe weak enough to be in the linear regime; this condition has been checked by verifying\nthat the amplitude of the reflected and transmitted wavepackets scales linearly with the\namplitude of the incident wavepacket. A remarkable feature stemming from nonlinear\neffects beyond this approximation is discussed in Sec.3.2.\nSnapshots of the wavepacket evolution at subsequent times are given in Fig.4 for\nthe most illustrative case in which the wavepacket is initially at xowp > 0 outside the\nwhite hole and propagates towards the horizon on the din mode with a wavevector\nkwp < 0 well within the hydrodynamic region, |kwp | \u001c \u03bed\u22121 . Its frequency distribution\nis concentrated around the carrier frequency \u03c9wp ' (v0 \u2212 cd ) |kwp |. As the wavevector\ndistribution is concentrated in the hydrodynamic region k\u03bed \u001c 1 where the dispersion\nis almost linear, the wavepacket gets weakly distorted while propagating towards the\nhorizon. Dynamical stability of the white hole configuration is confirmed by the fact\nthat no exponentially growing perturbation of the horizon is triggered by the arrival of\nthe incident wavepacket.\nWithin a strict hydrodynamic picture where the high momentum uout\n1,2 modes were\ncompletely neglected, one would expect that no excitation can propagate across the\nhorizon into the white hole as no leftward propagating modes are available inside the\nwhite hole at \u03c9wp . As a consequence, the incident wavepacket either accumulates at\nthe horizon or is reflected. This picture is oversimplified as the combination of the\nblue shift at the white hole horizon and the super-luminal character of the Bogoliubov\ndispersion may lead to a significant transmission into uout\n1,2 modes with large wavevectors\nin the vicinity of \u00b1kZ . In [18], it was predicted that the amplitude of these transmitted\nwavepackets is much larger than the one of the reflected one even for very smooth white\nhole horizons.\nThese expectations are confirmed in our numerical calculations shown in Fig.4. The\nreflected wavepacket is actually small, but clearly visible in the insets of the two latest\ntime panels. As expected, it propagates away from the horizon at the speed cd + v0 .\n\n\fAcoustic white holes in atomic BECs\n\n11\n\nIn agreement with the condition that the carrier frequency \u03c9wp has to be conserved\nafter scattering, the carrier wavevector of the reflected wave packet is smaller than the\nincident one by a factor (v0 \u2212 cd )/(v0 + cd ).\nAt relatively short times after impinging on the horizon (see e.g. the \u03bcd t = 2000\npanel of Fig.4), there is a single transmitted wavepacket that propagates into the white\nhole with a group velocity close to vZ . As one can see in the left inset, its shape is\ncharacterized by a carrier at a wavevector kZ and a slower modulation. This latter can\nbe interpreted as the result of interference between the uout\nand uout\ncomponents of\n1\n2\nwavevector approximately kuout\n' kZ + \u03c9wp /vZ and kuout\n' \u2212kZ + \u03c9wp /vZ , see Fig.2(a).\n1\n2\nFrom the Bogoliubov expression for the density perturbation [9], one immediately\nrecognizes oscillations at \u00b1kuout\nand \u00b1kuout\n. The slow modulation corresponds to the\n1\n2\nbeating of the \u00b1kuout\nand \u2213kuout\ncomponents, and has a wavevector qbeat \u2248 2\u03c9wp /|vZ | \u2248\n1\n2\n2(cd \u2212 v0 ) |kwp |/|vZ |. The quantitative agreement of this Bogoliubov prediction for qbeat\nwith the period of the slow modulation extracted from the \u03bcd t = 2000 panel of Fig.4\nconfirms our interpretation.\nAt later times (e.g. \u03bcd t = 3500), the curvature of the Bogoliubov dispersion makes\nthe uout\nand uout\nwavepackets to eventually separate in space. As a result, the slow\n1\n2\nmodulation due to their interference disappears and one is left with two Gaussian\nwavepackets. The presence of the transmitted wavepacket on the negative norm uout\n2\nout-going mode can be interpreted as the result of a stimulated Hawking emission [25].\nThis classical counterpart of Hawking radiation was recently investigated in experiments\nusing gravity waves in water tanks [28, 29].\nHad we considered an incident wave packet with a smaller wave vector kwp , the\ntime needed for the two transmitted wave packets to separate would be longer as the\ngroup velocities associated with the two roots uout\nand uout\nwould be closer. In the\n1\n2\nout\nout\n|kwp | \u2192 0 limit, the two wave vectors ku1 and ku2 tend to \u00b1kZ and the wavepackets\nnever separate.\nFor the sake of completeness, it is interesting to compare these results to the case\nof a black hole configuration. As before, we consider a Gaussian wavepacket centered at\nxowp > 0 outside the black hole which propagates towards the horizon on the uin mode\nwith a wavevector kwp < 0 well within the hydrodynamic region, |kwp | \u001c \u03beu\u22121 . As one\ncan see in the snapshots shown in Fig.5, the uin incident wave packet scatters on the\nhorizon and splits into a reflected wavepacket on the uout mode and a pair of transmitted\nones on the modes labelled as dout\nand dout\nin Fig.2(c,d): while the stronger and faster\n1\n2\nwavepacket corresponds to the transmitted positive-norm dout\nmode, the weaker one\n1\nout\ncorresponds to the negative-norm d2 mode and results from the same mixing of positive\nand negative modes that underlies Hawking radiation [25]. In contrast to the white hole\ncase, all out-going wave packets have significantly different group velocities and separate\nin space almost immediately; furthermore, the carrier wavevectors of all wavepackets\ntend to zero in the |kwp | \u2192 0 limit. The reason of these remarkable differences is easily\nunderstood in terms of the dispersion curves shown in Fig.2.\n\n\fAcoustic white holes in atomic BECs\n\n12\n\nFigure 5. Scattering of a phonon wavepacket on a black hole horizon. The different\npanels show snapshots of the density modulation \u03b4n(x) = n(x) \u2212 n0 at subsequent\ntimes. Black hole parameters as in Fig.2(c,d) with \u03c3x /\u03beu = 0.5. Wavepacket\nparameters kwp \u03beu = 0.05, \u03c3wp /\u03beu = 80.\n\n3.2. Back-reaction of the wave packet on the horizon\nThe previous discussion of phonon scattering on the white hole horizon has highlighted\na quite similar physics as compared to the black hole case: an incident wave packet\nsplits in several reflected and transmitted wavepackets whose carrier wavevector is fixed\nby energy conservation arguments. As we are considering weak incident wavepackets,\nthe amplitude of the reflected and transmitted scales linearly with the incident one.\nHowever, in addition to these expected wave packets, a striking unexpected feature\nis visible in the latest time snapshot of Fig.4 right inside the white hole horizon: a\nstationary density modulation with a spatially flat envelope and a fast oscillating carrier.\nAt late times, the amplitude of this density modulation saturates to a finite value. A\nsimilar effect was very recently reported for a classical white hole analog using gravity\nwaves on the surface of a water tank [28, 29].\nIts physical origin can be understood in terms of the zero-mode in the Bogoliubov\ndispersion: the vanishing \u03c9-frequency of this mode explains the stationarity of the\npattern and the observed wavelength of the modulation coincides with the value kZ of\nthe zero-mode wavevector in the upstream region. Still, the microscopic rectification\nprocess that is responsible for the excitation of a zero-frequency mode from a finite\n\n\fAcoustic white holes in atomic BECs\n\n13\n\nFigure 6. Log-log plot of the amplitude of the zero-mode modulation as a function\nof the peak incident wavepacket amplitude. The zero-mode modulation amplitude\nis extracted from late-time snapshots of simulations of the same configuration as\nconsidered in Fig.4. The black dotted line is a fit with a square law \u03b4nz = C \u03b4n2wp .\n\nfrequency wavepacket requires further investigation as it is not allowed within a\nlinearized Bogoliubov theory on a stationary background.\nTo assess its origin in terms of some nonlinear effect, we have repeated the\nsame numerical simulation of the GPE with different amplitudes of the incident\nwavepacket. The results are summarized in Fig.6: the late-time amplitude of the zeromode modulation scales indeed proportionally to the square of the incident wavepacket\namplitude. A simplest physical interpretation can be put forward as follows: the incident\nwavepacket slightly distorts the wavefunction in the horizon region breaking the Hartree\ncondition (3). The resulting perturbation of the Hartree potential is then responsible\nfor the continuous emission of phonons via the Landau-C\u0306erenkov emission discussed\nin [2, 6] for a uniform super-sonic flow hitting a defect.\nThis interpretation is confirmed by the numerical observation that no such feature\nwas ever observed for black hole configurations: in this latter case, the super-sonic region\nis in fact located downstream of the defect so that the zero-mode propagates towards\nthe horizon. This fact is clearly visible in Fig.2(c). As a result, the zero-mode can not\nbe excited by a perturbation localized in the horizon region of a black hole.\nTo summarize, our numerical simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation show\nthat the white hole configuration is dynamically stable at mean-field level even beyond\nthe linearized regime considered so far in the literature. Even when it is excited by a\nsizable incident wavepacket, the condensate does not develop any exponentially growing\n\n\fAcoustic white holes in atomic BECs\n\n14\n\nperturbation: the amplitude of the scattered wavepackets is roughly proportional to the\nincident amplitude and the amplitude of the zero-mode perturbation tends at late times\nto a stationary value proportional to the square of the incident wavepacket amplitude.\n4. The effect of quantum fluctuations\nAfter having assessed in the previous Section the dynamical stability of a white\nhole configuration at the level of mean-field theory, we now proceed to investigate\nthe consequences of quantum fluctuations, and in particular the radiation that is\ncontinuously emitted by the white hole horizon once this has been formed. Our\ninvestigation will make use of the same truncated-Wigner numerical technique used\nin [15]. We refer to this paper for a more detailed discussion about technical details.\nAt the initial time t = 0, the condensate is assumed to be spatially homogeneous at\ndensity n0 and to be flowing at a constant speed v0 ; both the interaction constant and\nthe external potential are initially flat and equal to gd and Vd , respectively. The white\nhole horizon is formed at the time t0 by ramping g and V in the upstream x < 0 region\nto their final values gu and Vu . This ramp takes place within a time \u03c3t . Eventually, g\nand V tend to a arctan-shaped spatial profile of characteristic thickness \u03c3x .\nQuantum and thermal fluctuations on top of the initial homogeneous condensate\ncan be treated by means of the standard Bogoliubov theory of dilute Bose gas. Within\nthe Wigner method, this translates [30] into a stochastic initial condition with a suitable\nGaussian noise added on top of the plane-wave initial wavefunction (4) of mean-field\ntheory. The variance of the Gaussian noise is determined by the initial temperature T0 .\nException made for Fig.9(b), all numerical data shown in the figures refer to the case of a\nvanishing initial temperature T0 = 0. The time evolution of the stochastic wavefunction\nstarting from its initial state follows the deterministic GPE evolution (2) including the\nchosen form of the nonlinear interaction constant g(x, t) and of the external potential\nV (x, t). Expectation values of symmetrically ordered observables at any later time are\nobtained by taking the corresponding stochastic average over the ensemble of evolved\nwavefunctions.\n4.1. Signatures of white hole emission in the correlation pattern of density fluctuations\nIn [15] it was shown that a good deal of information of the physical properties of Hawking\nradiation can be extracted from the correlation pattern of density fluctuations at equal\ntimes, defined as\nG(2) (x, x0 ) =\n\nh\u03a8\u0302\u2020 (x) \u03a8\u0302\u2020 (x0 ) \u03a8\u0302(x0 ) \u03a8\u0302(x)i\n\n=\nh\u03a8\u0302\u2020 (x) \u03a8\u0302(x)i h\u03a8\u0302\u2020 (x0 ) \u03a8\u0302(x0 )i\nhn(x)n(x0 )i\n1\n=\n\u2212\n\u03b4(x \u2212 x0 ).\n0\nhn(x)i hn(x )i hn(x)i\n\n(8)\n\nIn this section, we follow the same line for the case of a white hole, trying to isolate the\npeculiar features that characterize the white hole counterpart of the Hawking radiation\n\n\fAcoustic white holes in atomic BECs\n\n15\n\nFigure 7.

The dashed line in (a) indicates the prediction\n(26) for the central position of the d \u2212 u1,2 correlation discussed in Sec.5.3.\n\nfrom black holes. Looking at the Bogoliubov dispersions shown in Fig.2(a,b), we expect\nfrom energy conservation arguments that correlated pairs of quanta can be emitted from\nout\nout\nthe horizon either into uout\nand uout\n1 and u2 modes or into the d\n2 modes: the negative\nout\nenergy of the u2 partner can in fact compensate the positive energy of the uout\nor\n1\nout\nd ones, so to give a zero total energy of the pair. As it happened in black holes,\nthese processes correspond to clearly distinct features in the correlation pattern. An\nanalytical understanding of this white hole radiation will be provided in Sec.5. Color\nplots of a suitably normalized density correlation G(2) (x, x0 ) are shown in Fig.7. For\nnumerical convenience, all density correlation plots have been smoothened out with a\nGaussian spatial filter of size `av /\u03bed = 1. The main features that are visible in the plots\ncan be classified as follows:\n(i) The strong and negative correlation strip on the x = x0 main diagonal results from\nthe usual many-body antibunching due to repulsive interactions and has no relation\nwith the presence of an horizon.\n(ii) A system of stripes parallel to the main diagonal appears in the x < 0 region inside\nthe white hole as soon as the horizon is formed. As time goes on, the fringes move\n\n\fAcoustic white holes in atomic BECs\n\n17\n\nFigure 9. Time evolution of the peak-to-peak amplitude of the checkerboard pattern\nmeasured within the region indicated by the white rectangle in Fig.7. The upper (a)\npanel shows a semilog plot for a zero initial temperature T0 = 0.

The cyan straight lines are guides to the eye which emphasize that the growth\nis approximatively logarithmic (linear) in the zero (finite) temperature cases.\n\naway from the main diagonal at an approximately constant speed and eventually\ndisappear from the region of sight. We have checked that their presence and shape\ndoes not depend on the presence of the horizon, but rather on the speed of the\ntime-modulation: the slower the ramp (i.e. the longer \u03c3t ), the weaker the fringe\namplitude. On the basis of [31], these fringes can be interpreted as a consequence\nof the dynamical Casimir emission of pairs of counterpropagating phonons at all\npoints where the interaction constant is modulated in time, g = gd \u2192 gu . It is\ninteresting to note that in the white hole case the dynamical Casimir phonons are\nable to travel back to the horizon. As a direct consequence of this fact, feature (ii)\nextends also into the x > 0, x0 < 0 and x < 0, x0 > 0 quadrants. As the scattering\nof dynamical Casimir phonons incident off the horizon may interfere with the white\nhole emission, it is then important to ensure that the intensity of the dynamical\nCasimir emission is efficiently suppressed by a suitably long formation time \u03c3t .\n(iii) Spatially oscillating correlations appear between points right outside and right\ninside the horizon. The correlation pattern has a sinusoidal dependence as\na function of the position of the point located inside the horizon, while the\ndependence on the outside point is much smoother. The wavevector of the fringes\n\n\fAcoustic white holes in atomic BECs\n\n18\n\nis approximately equal to the zero-mode wavevector kZ introduced in the previous\nsection. As time goes on, these fringes extend into a larger area further away from\nthe horizon, but their amplitude at each given point eventually tends to a finite\nvalue, constant in time. This last fact is better visible in the cuts taken along the\nmagenta line that are shown in Fig.8(a). Remarkably, the envelope of the fringe\nsystem shows a slow modulation, with a minimum approximately located along the\nblue dashed line of Fig.7(b), x/vZ = x0 /(v0 + cd ), which suggests that this feature is\nrelated to the emission of pairs of quanta by the horizon into the u1,2 and d modes.\nAn analytical discussion of this feature will be provided in Sec.5.3.\n(iv) A checkerboard pattern appears in the correlations between pair of points located\ninside the white hole. As time goes on, the checkerboard pattern extends further\naway from the horizon. The spatial wavevector of the checkerboard is approximately\nequal to kZ in both x, x0 directions, which suggests that it is due to the emission\nof pairs of quanta by the horizon into the u1,2 modes. In contrast to feature (iii)\nand to what was always observed for black holes in [15], its amplitude at any given\npoint does not tend to a stationary value, but keeps on steadily increasing. This\nremarkable fact is visible in the cuts of the correlation pattern shown in Fig.8(b)\nand, even more clearly, in the plot of the checkerboard amplitude as a function of\ntime shown in Fig.9(a,b). For a vanishing initial temperature T0 = 0, the growth\nappears to follow a logarithmic law. For a finite initial temperature T0 > 0, the\ngrowth appears to be instead linear with a slope proportional to T0 . An analytical\ninterpretation of all these features will be discussed in Sec.5.4.\n4.2. Comparison with Hawking radiation from black holes\nFor the sake of completeness it can be useful to briefly review the main properties of\nthe Hawking emission from a black hole [15, 25]. This should facilitate the reader in\nappreciating the analogies and differences with the white hole radiation. As before,\nthis study is based on the correlation pattern of density fluctuations, some examples of\nwhich are shown in Fig. 10. Several features can be identified:\n(i) As expected, the strong and negative correlation strip on the x = x0 main diagonal\nis almost identical in the white hole and black hole configurations.\n(ii) The moving pattern of fringes due to the dynamical Casimir emission of phonons by\nthe time-modulated interaction constant is also very similar in the black and white\nhole configuration. The main difference is purely geometrical: as a result of the\ndifferent relative position of the super- and sub-sonic regions, the low-k dynamical\nCasimir phonons are not able to travel back to the horizon and are fully dragged\ninto the black hole.\n(iii) A symmetric pair of negative correlation tongues extend from the horizon point for\npoints x and x0 located on opposite sides from the horizon.

The horizon is formed within a time \u03bcu \u03c3t = 0.5 around \u03bcu t0 = 2.5\nand has a spatial thickness \u03c3x /\u03beu = 0.5.

This is to be contrasted\nto the white hole case where the wavevector of uout\n1,2 modes tends to \u00b1kZ which is of the\norder of the inverse healing length 1/\u03beu in the supersonic region.\nTo summarize, in this Section we have described the properties of the quantum\nemission of phonons from the white hole horizon. As in the black hole case, the peculiar\nquantum correlations between the consituents of each pairs result into long distance\ncorrelations of the density fluctuations. Several novel features have been highlighted:\nas the quantum emission into the white hole consists of short wavelength excitations\ncomparable to the healing length, the correlation pattern shows a fast sinusoidal\n\n\fAcoustic white holes in atomic BECs\n\n20\n\nmodulation. Furthermore, the amplitude of the checkerboard pattern for pairs of points\nlocated inside the white hole keeps on growing in time. This is in stark contrast with\nthe stationary character of Hawking radiation from black holes. The consequence of this\nsteady growth of density fluctuations for the stability of the white hole configuration\nrequires a detailed study of the back-action effect of quantum fluctuations onto the flow\nand will be the subject of further work.\n5. Analytical theory\nIn this Section we sketch an analytical framework offering a physical interpretation of\nthe numerical observations discussed in the previous Sections. More details will be given\nin future publications, in particular in Carlos Mayoral's PhD thesis [32]. Our approach\nis based on the step-like horizon model first introduced at the level of mean-field theory\nin [20] and then developed into a full theory of quantum fluctuations and Hawking\nradiation in [25]. Here, we will show that this theoretical model is able to explain most\nof the numerically observed physics and to provide quantitatively accurate predictions\nfor most relevant observables.\n5.1. Dynamical stability of white holes\nIn this first subsection we address the issue of the dynamical stability of the white hole\nconfiguration. The numerical observations reported in Sec.3 indicate that the chosen\nconfiguration is dynamically stable. Here we confirm this conclusion by analytical\nmeans. Our analytical approach is inspired by [20] and gets to similar conclusions.\nFor analytical simplicity, we restrict our attention to the same configuration used in\nthe numerical calculations, that is a BEC in the plane wave state (4) with a spatially\nconstant density n0 and flow speed v0 ; the step-like white hole horizon is created by\nmeans of a sudden jump at x = 0 of both the nonlinear interaction constant g(x) and\nthe external potential V (x).\nDynamical stability of this configuration against perturbations of the horizon region\nis assessed by looking for eigenmodes of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations [1, 9] with\ncomplex frequency: the system is unstable if at least an eigenmode \u03b1 exists with a\nfrequency \u03c9\u0303\u03b1 such that Im[\u03c9\u0303\u03b1 ] > 0. As we are interested in instabilities that start in\nthe horizon region, boundary conditions have to imposed that the mode wavefunction of\nthe perturbation decays to zero at infinity on both sides of the horizon. At the horizon,\nthe mode wavefunction has to be continuous along with its first spatial derivative.\nMore precisely, we are looking for eigenmodes of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes\nequations:\n~2 \u2202 2\nu(x) + V (x)u(x) + 2g(x)|\u03c60 |2 u(x) + \u03c620 (x)v(x) \u2212 \u03bcu(x),\n(9)\n2m \u2202x2\n~2 \u2202 2\n~\u03c9\u0303v(x) =\nv(x) \u2212 V (x)v(x) \u2212 2g(x)|\u03c60 |2 v(x) \u2212 \u03c620 (x)u(x) + \u03bcv(x).(10)\n2\n2m \u2202x\n\n~\u03c9\u0303u(x) = \u2212\n\n\fAcoustic white holes in atomic BECs\n\n21\n\nWithin the spatially homogeneous upstream x < 0 region, the eigenmodes can be\nexpanded into plane waves as follows\nX\n(i)\nik\u0303u x\nu(x) =\n\u03b1i \u0169(i)\n(11)\nu e\ni\n\nv(x) =\n\nX\n\n(i)\n\n\u03b1i \u1e7du(i) eik\u0303u x ,\n\n(12)\n\ni\n\nwhere the sum over i runs over the Bogoliubov modes at frequency \u03c9\u0303, whose complex\n(i)\nwavevector k\u0303u satisfies the (complex) dispersion relation\n!\n~2 k\u0303u2 ~2 k\u0303u2\n2\n2\n2\n~ (\u03c9\u0303 \u2212 k\u0303u v0 ) =\n+ 2gu |\u03c60 |\n(13)\n2m\n2m\ndescribing Bogoliubov modes in a moving fluid at v0 . As usual, the amplitudes \u0169u and\n\u1e7du are determined by inserting the plane wave ansatz (11-12) into the Bogoliubov-de\nGennes equations (9-10). Differently from the standard cases [1, 9], the complex value\nof \u03c9\u0303 makes the \u0169, \u1e7d coefficients to be complex as well.\n\nFigure 11.\nLog-scale color plot of the determinant whose zeros define the\nasymptotically bound modes of a white hole configuration with a step-like horizon.\nX- and y-axis are the real and imaginary parts of the complex frequency \u03c9\u0303. As the\ndeterminant has no zeros in complex \u03c9\u0303 plane, no asymptotically bound modes exist.\nThis proves a fortiori that the white hole is dynamically stable. Same white hole\nparameters as in the previous figures.\n\nThe boundary condition that the mode wavefunction has to decay to zero for\n(i)\nx \u2192 \u2212\u221e restricts the sum to those Bogoliubov modes whose wavevector Im[k\u0303u ] < 0:\n\n\fAcoustic white holes in atomic BECs\n\n22\n\nout of the four solutions of (13), only two can then be retained \u00b6. Analogous conditions\nhold for the downstream, x > 0 region. The matching condition at the horizon imposes\nthat both u(x) and v(x) have to be continuous, as well as their first spatial derivatives.\nThe boundary conditions at infinity plus the matching conditions at the horizon\nreduce our problem to the detemination of four amplitude coefficients (two modes per\nu, d side) that have to satisfy four matching conditions. Non-trivial solutions (the socalled asympotically bound modes (ABM) [21, 22]) exist only for special values of the\ncomplex frequency \u03c9\u0303 that make the determinant of the corresponding linear system to\nvanish. As one can see in Fig.11, this never happens for the white hole system under\ninvestigation here. As dynamical instabilities are signaled by the existence of ABMs\nwith Im[\u03c9\u0303] > 0, the complete absence of ABMs confirms the numerical observation\nof Sec.3 that white holes are dynamically stable objects. Of course, the linearized\nBogoliubov theory that is used in this Section is not able to capture the stationary\nBogoliubov-C\u0306erenkov density modulation pattern discussed in Sec.3.2, that appears as\na consequence of nonlinear back-action effects.\nIn a forthcoming paper this theory will be extended to more complex configuration\ninvolving a pair of black and white hole horizons: in agreement with [21, 22], the black\nhole laser phenomenon shows up as a series of discrete eigenmodes with a positive\nimaginary part of the frequency. Each of them corresponds to a zero of the determinant\nat the corresponding complex frequency \u03c9\u0303. In a figure analogous to Fig.11, such modes\nwould appear as narrow blue spots corresponding to sharp minima of the logarithm.\n5.2. The S matrix and the white hole radiation\nIn the previous subsection we have shown that no complex frequency eigenmodes appear\nin a white hole configuration. All the physics of quantum fluctuations can then be\nstudied in terms of the input-output formalism of quantum optics [33, 34]: the central\nobject of this approach is the S(\u03c9) matrix connecting the amplitude operators for the\nout-going Bogoliubov modes to those of the in-going modes at the same real frequency\n\u03c9. This is a direct extension to the white hole configuration of the Bogoliubov theory\nof acoustic black holes first introduced in [35] and fully developed in [18, 19, 25].\nA sketch of the in-going and out-going modes for the white hole configuration\nwas shown in Fig.2(a,b): in the low-energy sector below the cut-off frequency \u03c9max\n(defined as the maximum of the dispersion of the u2 mode), there are three in-going\nin\nout\nmodes, labelled din , uin\n, uout\nand uout\n1 and u2 , and three out-going modes, labelled d\n1\n2 .\nAs it was discussed in previous works, the d and u1 out-going (in-going) modes have\na positive Bogoliubov norm and enter in the input-output formalism as annihilation\noperators b\u0302d,u1 (\u03c9) (\u00e2d,u1 (\u03c9)). On the other hand, the negative norm u2 modes enter the\nformalism as creation operators b\u0302\u2020u2 (\u03c9) (\u00e2\u2020u2 (\u03c9)). The input-output relations have the\n\u00b6 It can be shown that the number of such solutions is always two. More details on this issue as well as\non the relation between this boundary condition and the in-going vs. out-going character of the modes\nwill be given in future publications.\n\n\fAcoustic white holes in atomic BECs\n\n23\n\nform:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nb\u0302d (\u03c9)\n\u00e2d (\u03c9)\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed b\u0302u1 (\u03c9) \uf8f8 = S(\u03c9) \uf8ed \u00e2u1 (\u03c9) \uf8f8 .\n\u00e2\u2020u2 (\u03c9)\nb\u0302\u2020u2 (\u03c9)\n\uf8eb\n\n(14)\n\nThe white hole radiation consists of a finite occupation of the out-going modes even for a\nvacuum state of the in-going ones. In this framework, it appears as a direct consequence\nof the mixing of creation and destruction operators by the S-matrix (14). As usual in\nquantum optics [33, 34], such processes lead to a squeezed vacuum state as the output\nstate of the modes after having scattered on the horizon. Exception made for some\nremarks at the end of Sec.5.4, our investigation is focussed on the case of a T0 = 0\ninitial state where the in-going modes are assumed to be in their vacuum state defined\nby \u00e2d,u1 ,u2 |vaci = 0. The population of the out-going d and u1 modes is proportional to\n|Sdu2 |2 and |Su1 u2 |2 , respectively. Thanks to the unitarity of the S matrix, the population\nof the negative frequency partners is proportional to |Su2 u2 |2 = |Sdu2 |2 + |Su1 u2 |2 , which\nconfirms that phonons are created in pairs which carry no net energy.\nA simple way to estimate the matrix elements of S(\u03c9) is to look at the time evolution\nof incident wavepackets as done in Sec.3, and to extract the reflection and transmission\namplitudes from the intensity and phase of the out-going wavepackets. Alternatively, one\ncan obtain the Bogoliubov modes at a given \u03c9 by solving the corresponding Bogoliubovde Gennes differential equations: a numerical solution of this problem was performed\nin [18] for smooth configurations of the flow velocity and the speed of sound. Closed\nanalytical formulas for the transmission and reflection amplitudes of a black hole in the\nopposite limit of a step-like horizon were obtained in [25] and then in [36]: imposing\nappropriate boundary conditions at the horizon x = 0, one is able to match the\nBogoliubov plane-wave solutions within each homogeneous region for x \u2277 0 and then\nbuild a global solutions of the Bogoliubov problem.\nHere this last strategy is applied to a white hole configuration to obtain closed\nexpressions for the matrix elements of S(\u03c9) in the low-frequency limit within the steplike horizon approximation. In particular, we shall focus our attention on the matrix\nelements for the negative frequency u2 in-going mode that are involved in the white hole\nradiation:\n(v0 \u2212 cd )(v02 \u2212 c2u )3/2 (cd + cu ) 1\n2\n2\n|Su1 u2 | ' |Su2 u2 | '\n(15)\n2cu (cd + v0 )(cu \u2212 cd )\n\u03c9\ncd (v0 \u2212 cu )2\n.\n(16)\n|Sdu2 |2 '\ncu (v0 + cd )2\nThis behavior of the low-energy S matrix elements is common to all in-going modes: all\n\u221a\nthe matrix elements for out-going u1 and u2 modes diverge as 1/ \u03c9, while the ones for\nout-going d mode tends to a constant value. As a consequence, the spectral distribution\nof the quanta that are emitted into the uout\n1,2 modes into the white hole has the usual 1/\u03c9\nthermal form of Hawking emission, while the radiation leaving the horizon has a flat\nspectrum. This remarkable fact was first noticed in [18] as a result of a full Bogoliubov\n\n\fAcoustic white holes in atomic BECs\n\n24\n\ncalculation with a smooth horizon, and constitutes a crucial difference from the black\nhole case where the Hawking emission outside the horizon has a thermal 1/\u03c9 spectrum.\nFor higher frequencies (but still below \u03c9max ), the Su1 u2 matrix element quickly\ndecreases to small values, while the Su2 u2 one keeps a sizable value as it ends up\ndescribing simple reflection processes. For a smooth horizon of thickness \u03c3x \u001d \u03be, these\ncoefficients are expected to tend to respectively 0 and 1 with an exponential law of the\ncanonical Hawking form\n|Su(H)\n| = [1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03c9/\u03c9H )]\u22121/2\n2 u2\n\n(17)\n\n|Su(H)\n|\n1 u2\n\n(18)\n\n= exp(\u2212\u03c9/2\u03c9H ) |Su2 u2 |,\n\nwhere the specific value of the cut-off \u03c9H = kB TH /~ is determined by the analog of the\nsurface gravity of the horizon configuration under examination [10].\nBefore proceeding with the calculation of the density correlations, it is interesting\nto point out a remarkable relation connecting the S-matrix of black hole and white hole\nconfigurations related by a time-reversal symmetry [18, 19]:\n\u0002 W H \u0003\u2217 \u0002 BH \u0003\u22121\nS\n= S\n,\n(19)\nwith the convention that the d, u1 , u2 modes of the white hole correspond after timereversal (that exchanges the upstream and downstream regions) to the u, d1 , d2 ones of\nthe black hole as defined in [25]. Making use of the \u03b7-unitarity of S, that is S \u2020 \u03b7S = \u03b7\nwith \u03b7 = diag[1, 1, \u22121], this leads to\n\u0002\n\u0003T\nS BH = \u03b7 S W H \u03b7.\n(20)\n5.3. Density correlations between the internal and the external regions\nThe input-output approach reviewed in the previous section is the starting point for a\ncalculation of the correlation function of density fluctuations. Such a calculation was\nfirst performed in [25] for the black hole case and is briefly reviewed in Sec.5.5. The\nresults agreed with the numerical observations of [15]. Here we shall extend this theory\nto the case of white holes.\nFollowing the same lines as in [25], one can show that the density correlation\nbetween the internal and the external regions of the white hole far away from the\nhorizon can be written in the form\nZ \u221e\n(2)\n(2)\n0\nG (x, x ) = 1 +\nd\u03c9 \u03b4G0 (\u03c9, x, x0 )\n(21)\n0\n\nwith\n(2)\n\nn0 \u03b4G0 (\u03c9, x, x0 ) =\n\n1 X n Rkdout (\u03c9)Rklout (\u03c9)\nq\n\u00d7\n4 \u03c0 l=u ,u\nout out\n|v\nv\n|\n1 2\ng,d g,l\nout (\u03c9)x0 \u2212k out (\u03c9)x]\nl\n\n\u00d7 ei[kd\n\no\nS\u2217lu2 (\u03c9) Sdu2 (\u03c9) + c.c. .\n\n(22)\n\nHere, the point x is taken in the upstream region inside the white hole, while the point\n(2)\nx0 is taken in the downstream region outside the white hole. Of course, \u03b4G0 (\u03c9, x, x0 )\n\n\fAcoustic white holes in atomic BECs\n\n25\n\nis non-zero only within the \u03c9 < \u03c9max region where the uin\n2 mode exists. As already\nmentioned, we are here restricting our attention to the zero temperature case, T0 = 0.\nFormula (22) clearly indicates that the process that is responsible for the correlation\nsignal can be interpreted as the conversion of quantum fluctuations from the uin\n2 mode\nout\nout\nout\nout\ninto out-going pairs of d and u1 or d and u2 real Bogoliubov excitations: the\ndout quantum is emitted away from the white hole in the rightwards direction, while the\nuout\n1,2 quanta propagate upstream into the white hole.\nout\nWe have defined kd,u\n(\u03c9) as the value of the wavevector of the d, u1 , u2 outgoing\n1 ,u2\nmodes at the frequency \u03c9. The corresponding group velocities in the laboratory\nout\nout\nframe are defined as vg,(d,u\n. The density components Rkd,u\n(\u03c9) of the Bogoliubov\n1 ,u2 )\n1 ,u2\nmodes are written in terms of the Bogoliubov Uk , Vk coefficients as p\nRk = Uk + Vk =\n\u221a\n2\n1/2\nkdout (\u03c9) \u223c \u03c9\n[~k /2m\u03a9(k)]\n[9, 1]. In particular, note how Rkdout (\u03c9) goes as\nin the low-frequency limit, while Rkuout\n(\u03c9) tend to finite values simply because both\n1,2\nout\nku1,2 (\u03c9 \u2192 0) = \u00b1kZ : this simple fact will play a crucial role in the following.\n\nFigure 12.

In addition, its envelope shows a slower\nmodulation at a wavevector \u03c9max /vZ set by the ultra-violet scale \u03c9max . The central\nminimum of the feature lies along the straight line\n\nx\nx0\n\u2212\n=0\n(26)\nvZ\nv0 + cd\nand is due to a destructive interference between the u1,2 contributions. This peculiar\nphysics is illustrated in the cuts of the analytical pattern (25) that are shown in Fig.12:\npanels (a,b) show the separate contributions of the u1 and u2 modes: the carrier\nwavevector is set by kZ , while the slow modulation is fixed by \u03c9max . The lower panel\n(c) shows their sum: destructive interference is responsible for the additional minimum\nin the envelope along the line (26). Given the number of approximations involved in\nthe analytical calculations leding to (25), the qualitative agreement with the numerical\nresults can be considered as quite good, in particular for what concerns the presence of\nthe modulated envelope.\n5.4. Density correlations in the internal region: the growing checkerboard pattern\nThe same framework can be applied to the correlations between points located in the\ninternal region of the white hole far away from the horizon.

In this way, I\u000f\nbecomes time-dependent: in particular, its value for x = x0 follows a logarithmic growth\nwith \u03c4 . This fact is in agreement with the growth of the checkerboard pattern amplitude\nwith time that was observed in the numerical simulations. In Fig.9(a), we have tried to\nfit the numerical data with a logarithmic law (cyan line): the agreement is indeed quite\ngood.\nAs a further check of our interpretation, we have repeated the same calculation\nfor the finite temperature T0 > 0 case, which introduces an additional 1/\u03c9 factor into\n(32). The same strategy of imposing a infrared cut-off at 1/\u03c4 then correctly explains the\nlinear growth of the checkerboard pattern in time that was observed in the numerical\ncalculation of Fig.9(b). All these features will be discussed thoroughly in [32].\n(2)\nn0 \u03b4G0 (x, x0 )\n\n\fAcoustic white holes in atomic BECs\n\n28\n\n5.5. Analytic form of correlations in a black hole configuration\nFor the sake of completeness and to better understand the peculiarities of the white\nhole emission, it is useful to briefly review the analytical form of the different features\nthat appear in the correlation pattern of black holes [25]. The main ingredient of the\ncalculation is again the S matrix that connects the amplitude operators for the outin\nout\nBogoliubov modes to those of the in-going uin , din\ngoing uout , dout\n1 , d2 ones. From\n1 , d2\nthe relation (20), it is immediately clear that for all l = {u, d1 , d2 }, Sld1 and Sld2 scale\n\u221a\nas 1/ \u03c9, while Slu tends to a finite value in the low frequency limit.\n5.5.1. Density correlation between the internal and external regions The density\ncorrelation between the inside and outside regions of the black hole have the form:\n1 X n Rkuout (\u03c9)Rklout (\u03c9)\n(2)\n0\nq\n\u00d7\nn0 \u03b4G0 (\u03c9, x, x ) =\n4 \u03c0 l=d ,d\nout v out |\n|v\n1 2\ng,u g,l\no\nout\nout\n0\n\u00d7 ei[ku (\u03c9)x\u2212kl (\u03c9)x ] S\u2217ld2 (\u03c9) Sud2 (\u03c9) + c.c. ,\n(33)\nHere, the point x > 0 is located in the upstream region outside the black hole, white\nthe point x0 < 0 is located in the downstream region inside the black hole.\nAs in the white hole case, expression (33) clearly indicates that the process\nresponsible for the correlation signal consists of quantum fluctuations incident on\nthe horizon from the d2 mode, which scatter into a correlated pair of real outgoing Bogoliubov excitations either into the u and d1 or into u and d2 modes. As\nalready mentioned, in the black hole configuration the wavevector klout of all out-going\nl = {u, d1 , d2 } modes tends linearly to zero in the zero frequency limit, which implies\n\u221a\nthat all Rkout\n(\u03c9)\n\u221d\n\u03c9.\nl\nFor this reason, none of the black hole correlations shows any modulation and all\nfeatures have a sharp tongue-like shape; within the low-frequency approximation of the\nS-matrix mentioned above, one indeed obtains\n\u0011\n\u0010\nx0\nx\n2\nX Al cu \u03c9max sinc \u03c9max ( vg,u\nout \u2212 v out )\n(2)\ng,l\nn0 \u03b4G0 (x, x0 ) '\n,\n(34)\n\u221a\nout\nout\n4\u03c0|vg,u vg,l | cu cd\nl=d ,d\n1\n\n2\n\nwhere sinc(x) = sin x/x and the Al coefficient has the following explicit form\n\u0012\n\u00133/2\nr\ncu (cu + v0 ) v02 c2d\ncu\nAd1 (d2 ) =\n\u2212 2\n(35)\n2\ncd (cu \u2212 v0 ) cu cu\ncd + (\u2212)cu\nout\nin terms of the microscopic parameters of the system. vg,u\n= v0 + cu > 0 is the group\nout\nout\nvelocity of the u mode escaping from the black hole. The group velocities vg,d\n< 0 of\n1,2\nout\nout\nthe d1,2 outgoing modes are very different from each other, vg,d1,2 = v0 \u2213 cd . This simple\nfact has the important consequence that the corresponding u-dout\nand u-dout\nfeatures\n2\n1\n(iii) and (v) in the correlation pattern of Fig.10(b) are spatially separated and do not\ninterfere, as it was instead the case for a white hole case of Sec.5.3. Feature (iii) may\nbe considered the main signature on the density correlation function of the Hawking\nemission from acoustic black holes.\n\n\fAcoustic white holes in atomic BECs\n\n29\n\n5.5.2. Density correlations in the internal regions The correlation function for points\nboth located inside the black hole, x, x0 < 0 contains a single contribution that originates\nfrom the d1 , d2 modes, namely\n\uf8eb\n(\u03c9)Rkdout (\u03c9) \u2212i(kout (\u03c9)x\u2212kout (\u03c9)x0 )\n1 \uf8ed Rkdout\n(2)\n1\n2\nd2\nq\ne d1\n\u00d7\nn0 \u03b4G0 (\u03c9, x, x0 ) =\n4\u03c0\nout out\n|vg,d1 vg,d2 |\n\u0001\n\u00d7 S\u2217d1 d2 (\u03c9) Sd2 d2 (\u03c9) + c.c. + (x \u2194 x0 ).\n(36)\nWithin the same low-frequency expansion approximation, one obtains a tongue-shaped\ncontribution of the form\n\u0010\n\u0011\nx0\nx\nB \u03a9 c2u sinc \u03a9( vout\n\u2212 vout\n)\ng,d1\ng,d2\n(2)\nn0 \u03b4G0 (x, x0 ) '\n+ (x \u2194 x0 ) .\n(37)\nout out\n4\u03c0vg,d1 vg,d2 cd\nwith\ncu (cu + v0 )\nB=\u2212\n2cd (cu \u2212 v0 )\n\n\u0012\n\nv02 c2d\n\u2212\nc2u c2u\n\n\u00133/2\n.\n\n(38)\n\nthat correctly reproduces feature (iv) of Fig.10(b). In particular, differently from the\nwhite hole case, no any infra-red divergence appears in the integral, which confirms the\nstationarity in time of the Hawking radiation pattern.\nIn summary, in this Section we have developed a Bogoliubov theory of quantum\nfluctuations in a white hole configuration within the step-like approximation. This\ntheory provides analytical formulas for the physical observables that were considered in\nthe numerical simulations reported in the previous Section. In contrast to the thermal\ncharacter of the Hawking radiation from a black hole, the spectral distribution of the\nemitted radiation outside the white hole turns out to be flat. The steady growth of\nthe density fluctuations in time is signalled by infrared divergences in the Bogoliubov\ncalculation. By imposing a suitable cut-off to the integrals one is able to reproduce\nthe numerically observed trend. Inclusion of the terms describing the back-action\nof fluctuations onto the condensate is presently in progress and is expected to shine\nlight on the effect of quantum fluctuations on the stability of the acoustic white hole\nconfiguration.\n6. Conclusions\nIn this paper we have reported a comprehensive investigation of the physics of acoustic\nwhite hole configurations. We have focussed our attention on a simplest model that\nis amenable to analytical and numerical work. Using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for\nthe condensate dynamics, we have established the dynamical stability of the white hole\nat the mean-field level: no exponentially growing perturbation of the horizon appears\nwhen this is hit by an incident wavepacket of Bogoliubov phonons. A nonlinear backaction effect due to the perturbation of the horizon by the incident wavepacket is visible\n\n\fAcoustic white holes in atomic BECs\n\n30\n\nas a stationary pattern of Bogoliubov-C\u0306erenkov waves by the perturbed horizon; the\namplitude of this pattern scales as the square of the incident wavepacket one.\nQuantum fluctuation are included within a truncated Wigner numerical approach;\nthe physics of an infinitely long condensate is reproduced by imposing absorbing\nboundary conditions to fluctuations. Signatures of the white hole emission by the\nhorizon are identified in the correlation function of density fluctuations. Differently\nfrom the Hawking emission from black holes, the white hole emission does not consist\nof low-energy excitations only, but involves high wavevector modes. As a result, the\ndensity correlation pattern shows fastly oscillating features on the scale of the healing\nlength. Furthermore, some of these features are not stationary in time, but indefinitely\ngrow with time with a logarithmic (linear) law for a zero (finite) initial temperature.\nAll the features found in the numerical observations are fully recovered and physically\ninterpreted by an analytical calculation within a step-like approximation for the horizon.\nInterestingly, this theory predicts a flat spectral distribution of the radiation emitted\noutside the acoustic white hole: this is in strike contrast to the thermal character of\nHawking radiation from black holes.\nBesides its intrinsic interest from the point of view of quantum fluctuations in\ncondensed matter systems, our results may open important avenues in gravitational\nphysics and quantum field theory in curved space-times: in spite of being related to\neach other by a simple time reversal symmetry, the physical properties of the quantum\nemission from black and white holes turn out to be significantly different, starting from\nthe thermal vs. flat frequency distribution of the emission. On one hand, Hawking\nradiation from black holes is concentrated in the low-k hydrodynamical modes whose\ndispersion has a linear, relativistic-like behaviour; for this reason, Hawking radiation\nhas turned out to be very robust against modifications of the ultraviolet behaviour of\nthe dispersion relation. On the other hand, white hole radiation is intrinsecally not an\nhydrodynamical process: because of the large associated blue shift, it is in fact highly\nsensitive to the ultraviolet behaviour of the Bogoliubov dispersion relation. On this\nbasis, we expect that white hole radiation may then provide an even better magnifying\nglass to test the intimate microscopic structure of the quantum vacuum.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are indebted to N.
