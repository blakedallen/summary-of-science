Ribeiro and Xiao-Gang Wen\n\narXiv:cond-mat/0410750v3 [cond-mat.supr-con] 27 Jul 2005\n\nDepartment of Physics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA\n(Dated: September 12, 2018)\nWe introduce a new mean-field approach to the tt\u2032 t\u2032\u2032 J model that incorporates both electron-like\nquasiparticle and spinon excitations as suggested by some experiments and numerical studies. It\nleads to a mean-field phase diagram which is consistent with that of hole and electron doped cuprates.\nMoreover, it provides a framework to describe the observed evolution of the electron spectral function\nfrom the undoped insulator to the overdoped Fermi metal for both hole and electron doping. The\ntheory also provides a new non-BCS mechanism leading to superconductivity.\n\nThe evolution of the electronic structure from the undoped antiferromagnetic (AF) insulator to the overdoped\nmetallic state of cuprates is a long standing problem. The\nplethora of anomalous behavior displayed by these materials is particularly striking in hole underdoped samples,\nfor which both experimental [1\u20136] and numerical [7\u20139] evidence suggests a dichotomy of the electronic excitations:\nexcitations around the nodal points [k = (\u00b1 \u03c02 , \u00b1 \u03c02 )] are\nwell described as Landau's quasiparticles while those near\nthe antinodal points [k = (\u03c0, 0), (0, \u03c0)] show no signs of\nquasiparticle-like behavior. Some experimental [10] and\nnumerical [7\u20139, 11] studies relate the absence of quasiparticles close to the antinodal points to the presence of\nexcitations that only carry spin.\nIn order to account for the aforementioned nodalantinodal dichotomy, in this letter, a new mean-field\n(MF) approach to the tt\u2032 t\u2032\u2032 J model is introduced which\ndescribes the low energy physics in terms of spinons and\ndoped carriers. Spinons are electrically neutral fermions\ndescribing spin-1/2 excitations. In the tt\u2032 t\u2032\u2032 J model double occupancy is prohibited and the doped carriers correspond to the removal of a lattice spin, which inserts a\nunit charge and a spin-1/2 in the system. Doped carriers\nare holes in the hole doped (HD) regime and electrons\nin the electron doped (ED) regime. For ease of speaking,\nbelow we refer to the doped carriers as dopons, which are\nspin-1/2 charged fermions. We show that the new MF\napproach leads to a MF phase diagram that resembles\nthe one of HD and ED cuprates. It also accounts for the\ndoping evolution of the electronic structure, as seen by\nARPES, in both HD and ED samples.\nWe start with the 2D tt\u2032 t\u2032\u2032 J Hamiltonian\n\u0010\n\u0011\nX\nX\ntij P c\u2020i,\u03c3 cj,\u03c3 + h.c. P (1)\nSi .Sj \u2212\nHtJ = J\nhiji\u2208N N\n\nhiji,\u03c3\n\nwhere tij = t, t\u2032 , t\u2032\u2032 for first, second and third nearest\nneighbor (NN) sites and P projects out doubly occupied\nsites. The tJ model on-site Hilbert space, {|\u2191i , |\u2193i , |0i},\nincludes states with either one or zero spin- 12 objects.\nTo obtain the new MF theory we start with an enlarged\non-site Hilbert space {|\u21910i , |\u21930i , |\u2191\u2191i , |\u2191\u2193i , |\u2193\u2191i , |\u2193\u2193i}\nwhich contains either one or two spin- 21 objects. The\nstates |\u21910i, |\u21930i and the local singlet state \u221a12 (|\u2191\u2193i\u2212 |\u2193\u2191i)\n\nare the physical states that map onto the states |\u2191i, |\u2193i\nand the vacancy state |0i, respectively, in the tJ model\non-site Hilbert space. The on-site triplet states, such\nas \u221a12 (|\u2191\u2193i + |\u2193\u2191i), are unphysical. We also introduce\nthe fermionic representation for the first spin (the lattice spin), Si = 12 fi\u2020 \u03c3fi , and the second spin (the doped\nspin), 21 d\u2020i \u03c3di , where \u03c3 are the Pauli matrices. Here, the\n\u2020\n\u2020\nspinors fi\u2020 \u2261 [fi,\u2191\nfi,\u2193\n] and d\u2020i \u2261 [d\u2020i,\u2191 d\u2020i,\u2193 ] are the spinon\nand the dopon creation operators on site i. Then, the\nenl\nt\nJ\nHamiltonian HtJ\n= Henl\n+ Henl\n, where\n\u0013\n\u0011 \u0012\nX tij \u0014\u0010 \u2020\nt\ne d \u03c3dj . iSi \u00d7 Sj \u2212 Si + Sj +\nHenl\n=\nP\ni\n2\n2\nhiji\n\u0015\n1 \u2020\n\u2020\n+ di dj + di dj Si .Sj + h.c.

Henl\nis such that only local singlet states\nhop between different lattice sites whereas the unphysical\nlocal triplet states have no kinetic energy. Therefore, the\nt\ndynamics included in Henl\neffectively implements the local singlet constraint. The enlarged on-site Hilbert space\ncontains at most one dopon. Hence, in (2), we introQ\nduce the projection operator Pe = i (1 \u2212 d\u2020i,\u2191 di,\u2191 d\u2020i,\u2193 di,\u2193 )\nwhich enforces the no double occupancy constraint for\nthe d-fermion. By definition, the total number of dopons\nin the system equals the number of doped carriers. We\nare mostly interested in the low doping regime and, thus,\nenl\nbelow we drop the projection operators Pe in HtJ\n.\nenl\nThe Hamiltonian HtJ is a sum of terms with up to\nsix fermion operators. In the following we replace some\nmultiple-fermion operators by their average so that the\nresulting MF Hamiltonian is quadratic in the operators\nf \u2020 , f , d\u2020 and d, and describes the hopping, pairing and\nmixing of spinons and dopons.\nJ\nis decoupled by\nThe exchange Hamiltonian Henl\nmeans of the d-wave ansatz [12] and becomes\n \u0303P\n\u2020 \u2020\n\u2020 \u2020\nfj\u2193 \u2212 fi\u2193\nfj\u2191 ) +\n\u2212 38J hiji\u2208N N [\u03c7fi\u2020 fj + (\u2212)jy \u2212iy \u2206(fi\u2191\nP\nh.c.] + a0 i (fi\u2020 fi \u2212 1) where \u03c7 and \u2206 are the spinon\n\n\f2\n\n\u2020 \u2020\n\u2020\n[\u03c8i1\n\u03c8i2 ] \u2261 [fi\u2191\nfi\u2193 ] , is:\n\nMF\n=\nHtJ\n\nX\u0002\n\n\u03c8k\u2020 \u03b7k\u2020\n\nk\n\n+\n\n\u0015\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0003 \u03b1zk \u03c3z + \u03b1xk \u03c3x \u03b2k \u03c3z\n\u03c8k\n+\n\u03b7k\n\u03b2k \u03c3z\n\u03b3k \u03c3z\n\n \u0303\n3JN\n(\u03c72 + \u22062 ) \u2212 2N b0 b1 \u2212 N \u03bcd\n4\n \u0303\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03b1zk = \u2212( 34J \u03c7 \u2212 t21 x)(cos kx + cos ky ) + a0 , \u03b1xk =\n \u0303\n\u2212 34J \u2206(cos kx \u2212 cos ky ), \u03b2k = 3b80 [t1 (cos kx + cos ky ) +\n2t2 cos kx cos ky + t3 (cos 2kx + cos 2ky )] + b1 and \u03b3k =\nt2 cos kx cos ky + t23 (cos 2kx + cos 2ky ) \u2212 \u03bcd , N is the lattice size and \u03bcd is the dopon chemicalppotential.

Then,\nMF\nthe spinon sector of HtJ\ndescribes the same spin dynamics as the slave-boson theory. [14] The dopon sector,\non the other hand, determines the dynamics of doped\nquasiparticles.

Since\nthe effective hopping amplitude of one hole in an AF\nbackground is renormalized by spin fluctuations, [13]\nwe replace the bare t, t\u2032 and t\u2032\u2032 by the effective hopping parameters t1 , t2 and t3 which are determined\nphenomenologically. The terms [(d\u2020i \u03c3dj ).(iSi \u00d7 Sj )]\nt\nand (d\u2020i dj Si .Sj ) in Henl\nare the sum of operators like\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\ndi,\u03b1 dj,\u03b2 fi,\u03b3 fj,\u03b4 fj,\u03bc fi,\u03bd and, in our decoupling scheme,\nonly contribute to the MF spinon and dopon hopping\nterms. The first contribution comes from the averages of\n\u2020\ntwo d and two f operators ( d\u2020i,\u03b1 dj,\u03b2 fi,\u03b3\nfj,\u03b4 ) and yields\nP\n\u2020\nt1 x\nthe spinon NN hopping term 4\nhiji\u2208N N(fi fj + h.c.).\nThe second contribution arises, instead, from taking the\n\u2020\n\u2020\naverages of the four f operators ( fi,\u03b3\nfj,\u03b4 fj,\u03bc\nfi,\u03bd ), which\nreduce to hSi \u00d7 Sj i and hSi .Sj i, and adds up to the dopon hopping term. We remark that, in the presence of local AF correlations, the vacancy in the quasiparticle state\nis surrounded by an AF-like configuration of spins. [9] To\napproximately account for this effect we assume that the\nspins encircling the vacancy in the one-dopon state are in\na local N\u00e9el configuration. Therefore, we use hSi \u00d7 Sj i =\n0 and h4Si .Sj i = (\u22121)jx +jy \u2212ix \u2212iy . Finally, to decouple\nthe spinon-dopon interaction [(d\u2020i \u03c3dj ).(Si +Sj )] we introP\nP\n\u2020\n3\nduce b0 = fi\u2020 di and b1 = 16\n\u00fb\u2208\u03bd N N fi di+\u00fb ,\n\u03bd t\u03bd\nwhere \u00fb = \u00b1x\u0302, \u00b1\u0177, \u00fb = \u00b1x\u0302 \u00b1 \u0177 and \u00fb = \u00b12x\u0302, \u00b12\u0177 for\n\u03bd = 1, 2, 3 respectively.\nThe resulting total MF Hamiltonian, written in terms\n\u2020 \u2020\nof the Nambu operators \u03b7i\u2020 \u2261 [\u03b7i1\n\u03b7i2 ] \u2261 [d\u2020i\u2191 di\u2193 ] and \u03c8i\u2020 \u2261\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\nx\n\nFIG. 1: (a) Regions in the (x-T ) plane where \u2206 = 0 or \u2206 6= 0\nas well as b0 = b1 = 0 or b0 , b1 6= 0.

In addition, choosing t1 = 2J\ncorrectly leads to the doping independent nodal dispersion \"kink\" energy \u2248 J2 found in HD samples. [17]\nIf spinons and dopons mix both b0 and b1 are nonzero [18] and spin and charge dynamics become strongly\ncoupled. Note that spinons and dopons are charge neutral and charged spin-1/2 fermions while b0,1 are charged\nspin singlet fields. The condensation of b0,1 effectively attributes charge to spinons and, in the presence of spinon\npairing (\u2206 6= 0), the system becomes superconducting\n(SC). Hence, the MF theory herein introduced provides\na new route to the SC state via coherent spinon-dopon\nmixing or, equivalently, spinon-dopon pair condensation.\nThe MF phase diagram in Fig. 1a contains four MF\nphases, all of which are observed in the cuprates: (a)\nd-wave SC when b0 , b1 , \u2206 6= 0; (b) Fermi liquid when\nb0 , b1 6= 0 and \u2206 = 0; (c) pseudogap metal when b0 , b1 =\n0 and \u2206 6= 0; (d) strange metal when b0 , b1 , \u2206 = 0.\nWe note that the MF SC transition temperature is\nvery high in the underdoped regime. This is an artifact\nof the MF calculation since thermal fluctuations of the\n\n\f3\n\nIn the above MF calculation we have ignored the\nAF phase.

[22] Without addressing the issue of coexistence\nof AF and SC, we obtain the AF phase shown in Fig. 1b.\nThe hopping parameters in the ED regime favor intrasublattice hopping processes which do not frustrate AF. [23]\nAlso, on the ED side dopons are located around (\u03c0, 0),\nwhich is away from the nodal points, thus weakening SC\nin the ED regime (it is destroyed at lower doping than in\nthe HD regime). Therefore, AF order is very robust on\nthe ED side where it extends over most of the SC dome\nand where it covers the pseudogap region N (in conformity with the lack of a vortex induced Nernst signal on\nthese materials [24]).\n\nTo compare the above MF theory to ARPES we note\ne \u221a1 (d\u2020 f \u2020 fi,\u03c3 fi,\u2212\u03c3 f \u2020 \u2212 d\u2020 f \u2020 fi,\u03c3 )Pe\nthat ci,\u03c3 = P\ni,\u2212\u03c3\ni,\u03c3 i,\u2212\u03c3\n2 i,\u2212\u03c3 i,\u03c3\nis the electron annihilation operator and the electron creation operator in the HD and ED regimes respectively.\nBelow, we ignore the incoherent contribution to the elec\u2020\n)\ntron spectral function and use ci,\u03c3 = \u221a12 (d\u2020i,\u2212\u03c3 + b0 fi,\u2212\u03c3\ninstead. Figs. 2a-2c show how the MF electron spectral\nfunction along the nodal direction evolves with hole doping. These are self-consistent T = 0 results concerning\nthe SC phase. At T = 0 only the two negative energy\n\u2212\nbands, namely \u01eb\u2212\n1,k and \u01eb2,k , are occupied. For zero doping the spectral function contains only a peak at \u01eb\u2212\n2,k\n(Fig. 2a). [25] Upon doping spectral weight is trans\u2212\nfered from the \u01eb\u2212\n2,k to the \u01eb1,k band, so that low energy\n\n0\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n(b)\n\n0\n\n(c)\n1.5\n\n\u2212J\n\n\u22122J\n(0,0)\n(0,\u03c0)\n\n1\n\n\u2212J\n\n\u03c9\n\n\u03c9\n\n\u2212J\n\n\u03c9\n\nphases of the condensates b0,1 are ignored. To crudely\nestimate the strength of b0 's phase fluctuations, we note\nthat the NN electron hopping term in HtJ induces a term\nP\n\u2212 |t21 | \u03c7 <ij> (b\u22170i b0j + h.c.). The resulting KosterlitzThouless transition temperature TKT = 0.9|t1 |\u03c7b20 , [19]\nabove which the condensate average b0 vanishes due to\nphase fluctuations, is plotted as the dashed-line in Fig.\n1a. The state with long-range SC order only appears\nbelow TKT (see Fig. 1b). Above TKT , and in the underdoped regime, there appear two distinct pseudogap\nmetal regions marked by N and PG in Fig. 1b. In region N, which is located between the MF Tc and TKT ,\nthe non-vanishing magnitude of the MF order parameters\nb0,1 leads to short-range SC correlations. This regime is\nobserved experimentally, as suggested by the large Nernst\nsignal measured in underdoped HD materials far above\nTc .

As a result, in\nthe underdoped regime two dispersive features arise. A\nlinear dispersion crosses the Fermi level (\u03c9=0) at a point\nthat deviates from ( \u03c02 , \u03c02 ) toward (0, 0). At higher energy, a band that resembles the dispersion of the undoped\nAF samples carries most of the spectral weight. Remarkably, this non-trivial behavior is also observed by ARPES\n[4, 15] and is to be contrasted with the conventional rigid\nband filling picture applicable to band insulators, namely\nthat upon hole doping the chemical potential falls on top\nof the valence band forming hole pockets.\nNotably, Figs. 2d-2g show that spectral weight transfered from the high energy to the low energy band\ndistributes in momentum space in agreement with the\nnodal-antinodal dichotomy displayed by ARPES data:\n(a) The spectral weight associated with each state in\nthe \u01eb\u2212\n1,k band develops on an arc-shaped region around\nthe nodal direction. [4, 6] (b) In underdoped samples\nthe spectral weight in the \u01eb\u2212\n1,k band is depleted near the\nantinodal points and, as a result, the spectral structure\nin this k-space region reflects only the high energy gap\nof \u01eb\u2212\n2,k (which is reminiscent of the AF insulator). [3] (c)\nThe total spectral weight in the \u01eb\u2212\n1,k band increases with\ndoping as the arcs extend to form a closed surface. (d)\n\n\f4\nThe coherence peaks in the antinodal region only appear\naround and beyond optimal doping. [2] (e) A transition\nin the topology of the minimum gap locus from hole to\nelectron-like at x \u2248 0.20 is obtained. [5, 26, 27]\nFigs. 2h and 2i show that the MF low energy electron\nspectral weight distribution for the ED regime is also\nconsistent with experiments. Indeed, at x = 0.05 there is\nAF order and an electron pocket is formed around (\u03c0, 0)\nand (0, \u03c0). [16] Further doping induces SC order and\nthe d-wave SC quasiparticles develop spectral weight in\nthe nodal region. As a result, a large \"Fermi surface\",\nungapped only along the nodal direction, is observed in\nFig. 2(i). [16, 28]\nTo conclude, in this letter we introduce a new, fully\nfermionic, MF approximation to the tt\u2032 t\u2032\u2032 J model. We\nalso fit the MF parameters t1,2,3 to ARPES data to argue that this MF approach is relevant to both HD and\nED cuprates. As supported by the fact that t1,2,3 \u223c J,\nthe renormalization of the hopping parameters results\nfrom quantum spin fluctuations. Further work is required\nto properly understand the doping dependence of t1,2,3 ,\nwhich reflects the change of spin correlations as the system is doped. Remarkably, though, the MF approach\ncorrectly accounts for the evolution of low energy spectral weight from the undoped to the overdoped regime\nonly by fitting the \u01eb\u2212\n2,k band to ARPES and by setting\nt1 = 2J. [29] We stress that fitting the renormalized parameters t1,2,3 to ARPES also leads to a relatively quantitatively correct phase diagram.\nWe analyze ARPES lineshapes in the cuprates in terms\nof a two-band description of the interplay between spin\nand charge dynamics. Related two-band interpretations\nwere also proposed by numerical studies. [9, 30] In Ref.\n30 quantum Monte-Carlo results for the large U Hubbard\nmodel were interpreted in terms of two different states:\n(a) holes on top of an otherwise unperturbed spin background and (b) holes dressed by spin excitations. Similarly, in Ref. 9 the nodal-antinodal dichotomy of the\nsingle hole tt\u2032 t\u2032\u2032 J model was understood in terms of two\ntypes of states where: (a) the vacancy is surrounded by a\nstaggered spin pattern and (b) the vacancy is surrounded\nby spins that screen the hole spin-1/2 away. In this MF\napproach the doped carrier can also be surrounded by\ntwo different spin structures: (a) in the one-dopon state\nthe vacancy is encircled by a local AF configuration of\nspins and (b) when the spinon and dopon mix the vacancy is encircled by a local spin singlet configuration.\n[31] In case (a) NN hopping is strongly frustrated (in our\nMF approximation it is actually set to zero). However, in\ncase (b) quasiparticles coherently hop between different\nsublattices \u2013 this fact shows up in the linear quasiparticle\ndispersion across the Fermi point [near ( \u03c02 , \u03c02 )] (Figs. 2b2c). The kinetic energy gain that follows the emergence\nof NN hopping stabilizes the formation of spinon-dopon\npairs which lead to the SC phase. It also prevents the\ncollapse of the chemical potential on top of the AF insu-\n\nlator band, [15] thus explaining the lack of hole pockets,\nin accordance with experiments.
