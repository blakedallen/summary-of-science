The notion of anisotropic regularity is\nextended to define the space of \u0393s -contact diffeomorphisms, which is shown to be a topological\ngroup under composition and a smooth Hilbert manifold. These results are used in a subsequent\npaper to analyse the action of the group of contact diffeomorphisms on the space of CR structures\non a compact, three dimensional manifold.\n\n1. Introduction\nContact manifolds arise naturally in complex and CR geometry. The boundary of a strongly\npseudoconvex domain is a contact manifold, and more generally, any strongly pseudoconvex CR\nmanifold is a contact manifold. In each case, the \u2202 \u0304b \u2013operator, which may be thought to embody the\ntangential Cauchy Riemann equations, is a natural operator that arises in analysis. The associated\nsecond order operator \u0003b is anisotropic, being second order in the holomorphic tangential directions,\nand only first order in the transverse directions. In [FS], Folland and Stein introduced some\nanisotropic function spaces, the anisotropic Sobolev spaces \u0393s and the anisotropic Banach spaces\n\u0393s,\u03b1 to reflect this behaviour, and showed that these operators are solvable with good estimates in\nthese spaces.\nIn recent years, much attention has been focused on the space of CR structures which a given\ncompact manifold admits. A theorem of Gray [G] states that all contact structures in the same\nhomotopy class are equivalent. It is natural, therefore, to fix an underlying contact structure and\nstudy the action of the space of contact diffeomorphisms on the space of CR structures that are\ncompatible with the fixed contact structure.\nIn [CL], Cheng and Lee constructed a transverse slice for the action of the contact diffeomorphism\ngroup. They avoided using the anisotropic spaces in [CL] by working in the Nash Moser category.\nIn [B], we restricted our attention to the case of the standard S 3 \u2282 C2 , and used explicit information\nto construct an anisotropic Hilbert space structure on contact diffeomorphisms near the identity.\nIn this paper, we show how to generalize the construction in [B], and show that, for general\ncompact contact manifolds, contact diffeomorphisms form a smooth Hilbert manifold modelled on\nthe anisotropic Hilbert spaces. In [BD3], we apply our results to construct transverse slices for\nthe action of the group of contact diffeomorphisms on the space of compatible Cauchy-Riemann\nstructures on three dimensional compact contact manifolds.\nDate: June 30, 2010.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 58D05, 53D35, 32G05.\nKey words and phrases.

DUCHAMP\n\nWhile our main interest is in the study of the action of contact diffeomorphisms on the space of\ncompatible CR structures, the space of contact diffeomorphisms is of independent interest. Smooth\ncontact diffeomorphisms were first studied by Gray [G]. Later, Omori [O1, O2] worked within\nthe category of ordinary Sobolev spaces to show that the space of contact diffeomorphisms is\nan ILH (Inverse Limit Hilbert) Lie group. We note that, in the special case where the contact\nmanifold admits a free transverse S 1 action, Biquard [Bi] used a different method to obtain a local\nparameterization for contact diffeomorphisms near the identity.\nIn this paper, we study the group of contact diffeomorphisms from the perspective of FollandStein function spaces, the natural function spaces respecting the contact structure. As we show\nin [BD3], by working in Folland-Stein spaces, we are able to obtain normal form theorems for the\naction of CR diffeomorphisms on CR structures with only finite regularity.\nThe paper is structured as follows. In Section 3, we introduce the anisotropic function spaces,\nand show that for s \u2265 (2n + 4), they form an algebra. We believe that the sharp result here\nwould be that the intersection of \u0393s with the space of bounded functions is an algebra for all s;\nhowever, the result which we have stated is sufficient for our purposes. In Section 2.6, we review\nRumin's complex, and state the results which we will use in the analysis of the space of contact\ndiffeomorphisms. In Section 4, we show that Ebin's trick of constructing a local coordinate system\nfor the space of diffeomorphisms works equally well for the anisotropic Folland-Stein spaces, and\nthen use Rumin's estimates to show the space of contact diffeomorphisms locally forms a smooth\nHilbert submanifold within the coordinate chart. Using this result, we easily prove that the space of\ncontact diffeomorphisms is a smooth Hilbert manifold modelled on the anisotropic function spaces.\n1.1. Notation. We summarize here the notation and conventions used throughout the paper.\nIf A is a subset of a topological space X, then A denotes the closure of A in X. If A and B are\nsubsets of X, then the notation A b B means that A is compactly contained in B.\nIf F : A \u2192 B is a map between Banach spaces, with norms k * kA and k * kB , respectively, then\nthe expression\nkF(f )kB \u227a kf kA\nmeans that there is a constant C > 0 such that kF(f )kB \u2264 Ckf kA for all f \u2208 A.\nWe give Rm the standard inner product (*, *), and we let |*| denote the corresponding norm.\nThe symbols (*, *)s and k * ks , for s = 0, 1, . . . denote the Folland-Stein inner products and norms,\nrespectively.\nIf N is a smooth manifold, then T N and T \u2217 N denote its tangent and cotangent bundles, respectively; \u039bp N denotes the p-th exterior power of T \u2217 N ; \u03a9p (N ) denotes the space of smooth p-forms\non N ; LX \u03b2 denotes the Lie derivative of the form \u03b2 with respect to the vector field X; and X \u03b2\ndenotes interior evaluation. If N has a Riemannian metric, then |X| denotes the norm of the\ntangent vector X with respect to that metric.\nThe symbol C r (E), r = 0, 1, 2, . . . , \u221e, denotes the space of C r -sections of a fiber bundle E \u2192 M ,\nequipped with the topology of uniform convergence of derivatives up to order r on compact sets.\nSimilarly, C r (M, N ) denotes the space of C r maps from M to N\nWe endow R2n+1 with the contact structure defined by the one-form\n\u03b70 = dx\n\n2n+1\n\n\u2212\n\nn\nX\nj=1\n\nxn+j dxj ,\n\n\fCONTACT DIFFEOMORPHISMS\n\n3\n\nwhere (x1 , . . . , xn , xn+1 , . . . , x2n , x2n+1 ) are the standard coordinates on R2n+1 , and we let dV0\ndenote the standard volume form:\n1\ndV0 = \u03b70 \u2227 (d\u03b70 )n .\nn!\nWe denote the contact distribution of \u03b70 by H0 \u2282 T R2n+1 and we set\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+ xn+j\n, and Xn+j =\n,1 \u2264 j \u2264 n.\nj\n2n+1\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\u2202xn+j\nObserve that the collection {Xj , 1 \u2264 j \u2264 2n} is a global framing for H0 . Notice that the 1-forms\nT0 =\n\n\u2202\n\n\u2202x2n+1\n\n, Xj =\n\n\u03b70 , dxj , dxn+j , 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n,\nare the dual coframe to T0 , Xj , Xn+j , 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n.\nLet f = (f 1 , . . . , f m ) be a smooth, Rm -valued function defined on the closure of a domain\nD b R2n+1 . We define\n(\nXi1 Xi2 . . . Xit f for t > 0\nXI f =\nf\nfor t = 0 ,\nwhere we have introduced the multi-index notation I = (i1 , . . . , it ), 1 \u2264 ij \u2264 2n and XI f =\n(XI f 1 , . . . , XI f m ). (For t = 0, I denotes the empty index I = ().) The integer t is called the order\nof I and written |I|.\nThroughout this paper, M denotes a fixed smooth, compact contact manifold of dimension 2n+1,\nwith contact distribution H \u2282 T M . We call sections of H horizontal vector fields. We let\n\u03c0H : T \u2217 M \u2192 H \u2217\ndenote the projection map; by abuse of notation, we also let\n\u03c0H : \u039bp M \u2192 \u039bp H \u2217\ndenote the extension of \u03c0H to the exterior product bundles. For convenience, we assume that M\nsupports a fixed contact one-form1 \u03b7. The characteristic (or Reeb) vector field T is the unique\nvector field satisfying the conditions T \u03b7 = 1 and T d\u03b7 = 0. We can then identify the dual\ncontact distribution with the annihilator of T , i.e.\nH \u2217 = {\u03b2 \u2208 T \u2217 M : T\n\n\u03b2 = 0} \u2282 T \u2217 M ;\n\nmore generally\n\u039bp H \u2217 = {\u03b2 \u2208 \u039bp (M ) : T\n\n\u03b2 = 0} ,\n\nand we have the identity\n(1.1.1)\n\n\u03c0H (\u03b2) = T\n\n(\u03b7 \u2227 \u03b2) .\n\nTwo forms \u03b21 and \u03b22 on M are said to be equal mod \u03b7, written\n\u03b21 = \u03b22 mod \u03b7 ,\nif and only if \u03b21 = \u03b22 + \u03b7 \u2227 \u03b1, for some \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a9\u2217 (M ). An easy exercise in the exterior calculus proves\nthe equivalences\n\u03b21 = \u03b22 mod \u03b7 \u21d0\u21d2 \u03b7 \u2227 (\u03b21 \u2212 \u03b22 ) = 0 \u21d0\u21d2 T\n\n((\u03b21 \u2212 \u03b22 ) \u2227 \u03b7) = 0 \u21d0\u21d2 \u03c0H (\u03b21 ) = \u03c0H (\u03b22 ) .\n\n1None of our results depend on this assumption, for if the line bundle T M/H is non-trivial, we can lift to a double\n\ncover of M , where a global contact form does exist.\n\n\f4\n\nJ. BLAND AND T. DUCHAMP\n\nWe will also fix an endomorphism J : H \u2192 H such that J 2 = \u2212Id and such that the operator\nX 7\u2192 d\u03b7(X, JX) is non-negative. (Such an endomorphism always exists.) We let let g denote the\nRiemannian metric defined by the formula\ng(X, Y ) = \u03b7(X)\u03b7(Y ) + d\u03b7(X, JY ) ,\nwere we have extended J to a map J : T M \u2192 T M by setting J(T ) = 0. The endomorphism J\nand the metric g are said to be adapted to the contact structure. Finally, \u2217 denotes the Hodge star\noperator associated to the metric g.\nWe say that a chart \u03c6 : U \u2192 R2n+1 for M is an adapted coordinate chart if \u03b7 = \u03c6\u2217 \u03b70 . It follows\nthat the identities \u03c6\u2217 T = T0 and \u03c6\u2217 H = H0 hold for \u03c6 adapted. An adapted atlas for M is a finite,\nsmooth atlas {\u03c6\u03b1 : U\u03b1 \u2192 R2n+1 }, consisting of adapted coordinate charts, together with open\nregions D\u03b1 b \u03c6\u03b1 (U\u03b1 ) such that {W\u03b1 = \u03c6\u22121\n\u03b1 (D\u03b1 )} covers M . By compactness of M and Darboux's\nTheorem for contact structures [Arn, page 362], M has an adapted atlas. An adapted coordinate\nchart for a fibre bundle \u03c0 : E \u2192 M with m-dimensional fibres is a coordinate chart for E of the\nform\n\u03c8 : U \u2192 \u03c6(V ) \u00d7 Rm : q 7\u2192 (\u03c6(\u03c0(q)), \u03c7(q))\nwith \u03c8 surjective and where \u03c6 : V \u2192 R2n+1 is an adapted chart for M . The chart is said to be\ncentered at the point q0 if in addition \u03c8(q0 ) = (0, 0). If \u03c3 : V \u2192 U is a local section of E, the\nfunction f\u03c3 : \u03c6(V ) \u2192 Rm defined by the formula\nf\u03c3 = \u03c7 \u25e6 \u03c3 \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121\nis called the local representation of \u03c3.\n2. Global analysis on contact manifolds\nIn this section, we develop some of the analytical machinery we need to study the space of\ncontact diffeomorphisms of M . We begin by introducing the Folland-Stein spaces \u0393s associated to\na compact contact manifold. We then introduce the notions of horizontal jet of a section of a fibre\nbundle and define the notion of contact order of a differential operator. We close this section with a\ndiscussion of Rumin's Complex [R] and its associated Hodge theory, which we need in Section 4 to\nconstruct a local parameterization of the group of \u0393s -contact diffeomorphisms of a compact contact\nmanifold M . Most of the results in this section are extensions of definitions and theorems in [Pal]\nand [E] to the context of contact manifolds.\n2.1. Folland-Stein function spaces. Let D be a bounded domain in R2n+1 . The Folland-Stein\nspace \u0393s (D, Rm ) is the Hilbert space completion of the set of smooth, Rm -valued functions on D\n(the closure of D) with respect to the inner product\nX Z\n(f, g)D,s :=\n(XI f XI g) dV0 .\n0\u2264|I|\u2264s D\n\np\nThe associated norm is written kf kD,s = (f, f )D,s . When no confusion is likely to arise, we\nsuppress reference to D and write kf ks ; and we set \u0393s (D) := \u0393s (D, R1 ).\nRemark 2.1.1. Although we used the contact framing {Xj : 1 \u2264 j \u2264 2n} of H0 and the volume\n1\nform dV0 = n!\n\u03b70 \u2227 (d\u03b70 )n to define the inner product, an equivalent norm results if the framing\nis replaced by any smooth framing of H0 and dV0 is replaced by any smooth volume form on D\u0304.\n0\nIn particular, suppose that D0 \u2282 R2n+1 is another bounded domain and F : D \u2192 D is a smooth\n\n\fCONTACT DIFFEOMORPHISMS\n\n5\n\ndiffeomorphism that restricts to a contact diffeomorphism between D and D0 . Then composition\nwith F induces an isomorphism\n(\n\u0393s (D0 , Rm ) \u2192 \u0393s (D, Rm )\n\u0393F :\nf\n7\u2192 f \u25e6 F\nbetween Banach spaces. To see this, notice that because the derivative of F respects the contact\ndistribution, XI (f \u25e6 F ) is a linear combination of terms of the form cJ * (XJ f ) \u25e6 F , |J| \u2264 s, where\ncJ denotes a smooth function formed from F and its derivatives. It follows that f \u25e6 F is of class \u0393s .\nWe caution the reader that the condition that F be a contact diffeomorphism is essential. For if F\ndoes not preserve the contact distribution then the expansion of XI (f \u25e6 F ) will in general involve\nterms of the form XJ f with |J| > s, which may not be square integrable.\nThe next lemma follows immediately from the definition of \u0393s .\nLemma 2.1.2.

Let D0 b D b R2n+1 , and let s = k + n + 2, k \u2265 0. Let f \u2208 \u0393s (D, Rm ). Then the\nfunctions XI f are continuous on D\u03040 for all multi-indices of order |I| \u2264 k.

In this section, we prove some basic estimates. Lemmas 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 are needed for our proof in Section 3 that composition and inverses of contact\ndiffeomorphisms are continuous operations. Lemma 2.2.3 and Proposition 2.3.5 are fundamental\nestimates used throughout the paper.\nLemma 2.2.1. Let s \u2265 2n + 3, k \u2264 s and consider open sets D0 b D b R2n+1 .

In the first instance we\nbound the term by kf k2D,s kgk2D,k as before; in the latter case we have\nZ\n|XJ (f )|2 |XK (g)|2 dV0 \u227akXJ f k2D0 ,0 sup |XK g(x)|2\nx\u2208D0\n2\n\u227akf kD,|J| kgk2D,|K|+n+2\n\u227akf k2D,s kgk2D,k ,\n\nD0\n\nwhere we have again made use of Lemma 2.1.3. Summing over all terms gives the final estimate. \u0003\nLemma 2.2.2. Let D0 and D be open sets with D0 b D b R2n+1 , and let f be a function in \u0393s (D),\nwhere s \u2265 2n + 3. Suppose that 1/f is bounded from above on D\u03040 by a positive constant C > 0.\nThen\nk1/f kD0 ,s \u227a (1 + kf kD,s )s .\nConsequently, 1/f is contained in \u0393s (D0 ). Moreover if 1/f 0 < C for another function f 0 \u2208 \u0393s (D)\nthen\nk1/f \u2212 1/f 0 kD0 ,s \u227a (1 + kf kD,s )s (1 + kf 0 kD,s )s kf \u2212 f 0 kD,s .\nProof.

The Folland-Stein space of sections of a vector bundle. In this section we define the\nFolland-Stein of sections of a vector bundle over a contact manifold.\nWe begin by extending the definition of the Folland-Stein space \u0393s (D, Rm ) of functions to the\nspace \u0393s (M, Rm ) of functions on a compact contact manifold. Let (\u03c6\u03b1 , U\u03b1 , D\u03b1 ) be an adapted atlas\nfor M . A function f : M \u2192 Rm is said to be a \u0393s -function if the functions f\u03b1 = f \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121\n\u03b1 lie in\n\u0393s (D\u03b1 , Rm ) for all \u03b1.

The Sobolev Lemma 2.1.3 clearly extends to this\nsetting:\nLemma 2.3.1. Let s = k + n + 2, and let Yj , j = 1, 2, . . . k be smooth sections of H \u2282 T M . Then\nfor any function f \u2208 \u0393s (M, Rm ), the functions Y1 Y2 . . . Yk f are continuous on M . Moreover,\nmax |Y1 Y2 . . .

In particular for s = 2k + n + 2,\nthe linear map\n\u0393s (M, Rm ) \u2192 C k (M, Rm )\nis continuous.\nSimilarly, Lemma 2.2.3 assumes the following global form:\nLemma 2.3.2.

View \u0393s (M, Rr ), r \u2265 1, as the Folland-Stein space of sections of\nthe trivial vector bundle M \u00d7 Rr \u2192 M . For r sufficiently large, there is a vector bundle injection\n\u03b9\nE ,\u2192 M \u00d7 Rr . Define an inner product on C \u221e (E) by the formula\n(f, g)E,s = (f \u25e6 \u03b9, g \u25e6 \u03b9)M,s\nC \u221e (E),\n\nfor f, g \u2208\nand let\nbe the Hilbert space completion of C \u221e (E) with respect to this\ninner product. It is not difficult to check that, although the inner product depends on \u03b9, the space\n\u0393s (E) does not.\n\u0393s (E)\n\nRemark 2.3.3. Because \u0393s (E) is a closed subset of \u0393s (M, Rr ), the Sobolev Lemma (2.3.1) extends\nto this setting,\nThe next proposition is the analogue of \"Axiom B2\" of Palais (see [Pal, page 10]) in the setting\nof contact manifolds.\nProposition 2.3.4. Let F : M \u2192 N be a smooth contact diffeomorphism between two compact,\ncontact manifolds. Let E \u2192 N be a smooth vector bundle over N and let F \u2217 E \u2192 M be its pull-back\nto M . Then the map \u03c3 7\u2192 \u03c3 \u25e6 F is a Hilbert space isomorphism between \u0393s (E) and \u0393s (F \u2217 E).\nProof. Choose a bundle injection \u03b9 : E ,\u2192 N \u00d7 Rr , and let {\u03c6\u03b1 : U\u03b1 \u2192 R2n+1 } be an adapted atlas\nfor N (see Introduction). Set U\u03b10 = F \u22121 (U\u03b1 ) and \u03c60\u03b1 = \u03c6\u03b1 \u25e6 F . Then {\u03c60\u03b1 : U\u03b10 \u2192 R2n+1 } is an\nadapted atlas for M . Use this atlas to define the inner product on \u0393s (M, Rr ). Then by construction\n(f \u25e6 F, g \u25e6 F )s,M = (f, g)s,N\nfor all f, g \u2208\n\n\u0393s (N, Rr ).\n\nRestricting f and g to sections of E then gives the result.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe next proposition shows that \u0393s satisfies \"Axiom B5\" of Palais ([Pal, page 39] for all s \u2265 2n+4.\n\n\fCONTACT DIFFEOMORPHISMS\n\n9\n\nProposition 2.3.5. Let Ej \u2192 M , j = 1, 2 be smooth vector bundles over M and let F : E1 \u2192 E2\nbe a smooth (not necessarily linear) fibre-preserving map. Then the map\n\u0393F : \u0393s (E1 ) \u2192 \u0393s (E2 ) : \u03c3 7\u2192 F \u25e6 \u03c3\nis a C \u221e map for all s \u2265 2n + 4.\nMoreover, if E1 is equipped with norm | * |E1 , then for every \u03c3 \u2208 \u0393s (E1 ) and every c > 0 there is\na polynomial Q with non-negative coefficients of total degree at most s such that\nkF \u25e6 \u03c3 \u2212 F \u25e6 \u03c3 0 ks \u2264 k\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3 0 ks Qs (k\u03c3ks , k\u03c3 0 ks )\n\n(*)\n\nfor all \u03c3 0 \u2208 \u0393s (E1 ), with |\u03c3 0 \u2212 \u03c3| < c.\nProof. Our proof follows a similar argument in [Pal, Theorem 11.3]. We first show that \u0393F satisfies\nthe polynomial estimate (*), from which continuity of \u0393F follows. It suffices to work in local\ncoordinates of an adapted atlas for M . Then \u0393s sections of Ej can be identified with elements\nof \u0393s (D, Rmj ), where mj is the fibre dimension of Ej . Let f : D \u2192 Rm1 be the local coordinate\nrepresentation of \u03c3, and choose a constant c > 0. Choose \u03c3 0 so that it's local representative\ng \u2208 \u0393s (D, Rm1 ) satisfies supx\u2208D |g(x) \u2212 f (x)| < c. Then in local coordinates F \u25e6 \u03c3(x) = F (x, f (x))\nand F \u25e6 \u03c3 0 (x) = F (x, g(x)). By smoothness of F and compactness of D0 , all derivatives of F are\nbounded and smooth on the set {(x, y) : x \u2208 D0 , |y \u2212 f (x)| < c. Hence, there is a fixed constant\nC > 0 such that\n|F (k) (x, y)| < C and |F (k) (x, y) \u2212 F (k) (x, z)| < C|y \u2212 z|\n\n(i)\n\nfor all (x, y) and (x, z) with |y \u2212 f (x)| \u2264 c and |z \u2212 g(x)| \u2264 c, where F (k) (x, y) denotes any mixed\npartial derivative of F of order k \u2264 s.\nNext recall that kF \u25e6 f \u2212 F \u25e6 gk2D0 ,s is a sum of integrals of the form\nZ\n(ii)\n|XI {F (x, f (x)) \u2212 F (x, g(x))} |2 dV\nD0\n\nfor |I| \u2264 s.

The Folland-Stein space of sections of a fibre bundle. In this section we define the\nFolland-Stein space \u0393s (E) of sections of E for s \u2265 2n + 4 in the case where \u03c0 : E \u2192 M is a smooth\nfibre bundle over M . For this range of s, \u0393s (E) is a smooth infinite dimensional manifold modelled\non the Folland-Stein space of sections of certain vector bundles. The construction and the proof\nare due to Palais (see [Pal, Chapters 12 and 13] for details). We emphasize that this construction\ndepends heavily on Propositions 2.3.4 and 2.3.5 (Palais' Axioms B2 and B5), which are satisfied\nfor s \u2265 2n + 4.\nLet \u03c0 : E \u2192 M be a fibre bundle, and choose a smooth section \u03c3 \u2208 C \u221e (E). The bundle of\nvertical tangent vectors along \u03c3 is the vector bundle defined by\nT\u03c3 (E) = {X \u2208 T E\u03c3(x) : x \u2208 M, d\u03c0(X) = 0} .\nPalais shows that there is a smooth fibre bundle isomorphism\n(2.4.1)\n\n'\n\nopen\n\n\u03c8\u03c3 : T\u03c3 (E) \u2212\u2192 O\u03c3 \u2282 E\n\nwhere O\u03c3 is a neighbourhood of the image of \u03c3. Palais also shows that the the image of every\ncontinuous section of E is contained in a set of the form O\u03c3 for some smooth section \u03c3.\nConsequently every continuous section of E can be identified with a continuous section of T\u03c3 (E)\nfor some \u03c3 \u2208 C \u221e (E), and C 0 (E) can we written as the following union of open sets:\n[\nC 0 (E) =\nC 0 (T\u03c3 (E)) .\n\u03c3\u2208C \u221e (E)\n\nSince s \u2265 2n+4 \u2265 n+2, Lemma 2.3.1 applies to give continuous inclusions \u0393s (T\u03c3 (E)) \u2282 C 0 (T\u03c3 (E).\nWe may thus define the Folland-Stein space \u0393s (E) to be the union\n[\n\u0393s (E) =\n\u0393s (T\u03c3 (E)) ,\n\u03c3\u2208C \u221e (E)\n\nequipped with the weakest topology such that \u0393\u03c8\u03c3 : \u0393s (T\u03c3 (E)) \u2192 \u0393s (E) is a continuous open map\nfor all \u03c3 \u2208 C \u221e (E).\nIn fact, \u0393s (E) is a Hilbert manifold with C \u221e atlas given by the charts \u0393(\u03c8\u03c3\u22121 ); and as Palais\nshows, smoothness of the transition functions for this atlas follows from Proposition 2.3.5.\nThe above construction is functorial:\nProposition 2.4.2 (Palais, Theorem 13.4).

Rumin only establishes the estimates stated above for the case s = 0 (see [R,\npage 290]). However, standard regularity theory yields the estimate for general s > 0.

In this section, we present a characterization\nof the closed subspace \u0393scont (T M ) \u2282 \u0393s (T M ) of \u0393s contact vector fields in terms of the Hodge\ndecomposition of the Rumin complex. We use this characterization in Section 4 to give a parameterization of the space of contact diffeomorphisms near the identity by contact vector fields near\n0.\nWe begin by recalling a few well known facts about contact vector fields. Recall that a smooth\nvector field X is called a contact vector field if and only if LX (\u03b7) = 0 mod \u03b7 (or, equivalently,\n\u03c0H (LX (\u03b7)) = 0). Write X in the form X = X 0 T + XH where XH \u2208 H and T is the Reeb vector\nfield, and use the identity\nLX (\u03b7) = X\n\nd\u03b7 + d(X\n\n\u03b7) = XH\n\nd\u03b7 + dX 0\n\nto conclude that X is a contact vector field if and only if it satisfies the standard identity\n\u2212XH\n\nd\u03b7 + T (X 0 )\u03b7 = dX 0 .\n\nRecalling that R1 = H \u2217 and dR f = \u03c0H (df ), for f \u2208 C \u221e (M ) = R0 , we can express this characterization in terms of the Rumin complex as follows: X is a contact vector field if and only if it\nsatisfies the identity\n(2.7.1)\n\ndR X 0 = \u2212XH\n\nd\u03b7 .\n\nNext observe that d\u03b7 defines a vector bundle map\n( )[ : T M \u2192 H \u2217 : X 7\u2192 X [ = X\n\nd\u03b7\n\nwhose restriction to H \u2282 T M is an isomorphism between the contact distribution and its dual\nspace, and let\n( )] : H \u2217 \u2192 H : \u03c6 7\u2192 \u03c6]\ndenote its inverse. The map\n\u221e\nC \u221e (M, R) \u2192 Ccont\n: g 7\u2192 Xg = gT \u2212 (dR g)]\n\nis an isomorphism between the space of smooth functions on M and the space of smooth contact\nvector fields. This map then extends to an isomorphism between the weighted spaces:\n(2.7.2)\n\n\u0393s+1 (M ) \u2192 \u0393scont (T M ) : g 7\u2192 Xg = gT \u2212 (dR g)] .\n\n\fCONTACT DIFFEOMORPHISMS\n\n19\n\nThe only new result here is the gain of one derivative in the Folland-Stein spaces, which follows\neasily from the two inclusions g \u2208 \u0393s and dR g \u2208 \u0393s .\nWe can now express the condition for X to be a contact vector field in terms of the harmonic\ndecomposition. Notice, in particular, the additional regularity in X 0 , the Reeb component of X.\n(The restriction s \u2265 2n + 4 below ensures that X is of class C 1 .)\nLemma 2.7.3. A vector field X \u2208 \u0393s (T M ), s \u2265 2n + 4, is contact if and only if it satisfies each\nof the following three conditions\n(a)\n\nX 0 = HR (X 0 ) \u2212 (n + 1) GR \u03b4R (X\n\n(b)\n\nHR (X d\u03b7) = 0\n(\ndR (X d\u03b7) = 0\nDR (X d\u03b7) = 0\n\n(c)\n\nd\u03b7)\n\nfor n > 1\nfor n = 1 .\n\nMoreover, if X \u2208 \u0393s (T M ) is a contact vector field, then X 0 \u2208 \u0393s+1 (M ).\nProof. Suppose that X \u2208 \u0393s (T M ). Applying the Hodge decomposition to Equation (2.7.1) shows\nthat X is a contact vector field if and only if it satisfies each of the three conditions\n(\ndR (dR X 0 + X d\u03b7) = 0 if n > 1\n0\n0\nHR (dR X + X d\u03b7) = 0, \u03b4R (dR X + X d\u03b7) = 0, and\nDR (dR X 0 + X d\u03b7) = 0 if n = 1\nThe middle equation is equivalent to\nGR \u03b4R (dR X 0 + X\n\nd\u03b7) =\n\n1\n(GR \u2206R X 0 ) + GR \u03b4R (X\n(n + 1)\n\nd\u03b7) = 0 ,\n\nfrom which the conditions (2.7.3) follow. Finally, suppose that X \u2208 \u0393s (T M ) is a contact vector\nfield. By (a) and Corollary 2.6.6, the function X 0 is an element of \u0393s+1 (M ).\n\u0003\n3. The topological group of contact diffeomorphisms\nLet Ds (M ) \u2282 \u0393s (M, M ), s \u2265 2n + 4 denote the subspace of \u0393s -diffeomorphisms of M . It is well\nknown that the space of C 1 -diffeomorphisms is an open subset of the space C 1 (M, M ) of C 1 -maps.\nMoreover, since s \u2265 2n + 4, there is a continuous inclusion \u0393s (M, M ) \u2282 C 1 (M, M ). It follows that\nDs (M ) is an open subset of \u0393s (M, M ). It is, therefore, a smooth infinite dimensional manifold; but\nit is not a group because Ds (M ) is not closed under composition (see Remark 2.1.1).\n\u221e (M ) \u2282 D s (M ) denote the subspace of C \u221e contact diffeomorphisms. By definition, the\nLet Dcont\ns\n\u221e (M ) \u2282 D s (M ).\nspace of \u0393s contact diffeomorphisms of M is the closed subspace Dcont\n(M ) := Dcont\ns\nWe show in this section that Dcont\n(M ) is closed under composition and inversion, and that both\ns\noperations are continuous. Consequently, Dcont\n(M ) is a topological group for s \u2265 2n + 4. In\ns\nSection 4, we prove that Dcont (M ) is a smooth Hilbert manifold (see Theorem 4.4.1). Our approach\nin this section and in the following section parallels the treatment of the full diffeomorphism group\ngiven by Ebin [E].\n3.1. Continuity of composition. To prove that composition is continuous, it is sufficient to\ne b R2n+1 . By the Sobolev lemma (see\nwork locally.

The smooth manifold of contact diffeomorphisms\nIn this section, we obtain a local coordinate chart for the set of contact diffeomorphisms in a\nneighbourhood of the identity. As a corollary, we show that for s \u2265 2n + 4, the topological manifold\ns\nDcont\n(M ) is a smooth submanifold of the smooth manifold Ds (M ) of \u0393s diffeomorphisms of M .\n4.1. The smooth manifold of contact diffeomorphisms. We begin by constructing a smooth\natlas for Ds (M ). Our construction is based on the following well known parameterization of smooth\ndiffeomorphisms near the identity diffeomorphism by smooth vector fields. Fix a C \u221e metric adapted\nto the contact structure (see Section 1.1), and let exp : T M \u2192 M denote its exponential map.\nRecall that exp is the C \u221e map defined by the formula\nexp(X) := \u03b3x,X (1)\nwhere \u03b3x,X : R \u2192 M is the unique geodesic curve with \u03b3x,X (0) = x, \u03b3 0 (0) = X \u2208 Tx M . Also recall\nthat for |X| sufficiently small, |X| is equal to the Riemannian distance between x and exp(X).\nNext consider the map \u03c7 from the space of C 1 -vector fields to the space of C 1 -maps\n\u03c7 : C 1 (T M ) \u2192 C 1 (M, M ) : X 7\u2192 FX ,\nwhere FX is the C 1 map defined by composition\n(4.1.1)\n\nX\n\nexp\n\nFX : M \u2212\u2192 T M \u2212\u2192 M .\n\nBy compactness of M , there is a number r > 0 such that any two points at distance less then r\napart are joined by a unique length minimizing geodesic.

For s \u2265 2n + 4, the map \u03c7 restricts to a smooth map\n\u03c7s : \u0393s (T M ) \u2192 \u0393s (M, M ) : X 7\u2192 FX = exp \u25e6X\non the space of \u0393s -vector fields. Moreover, there is an open neighbourhood U \u2282 \u03932n+4 (T M ) of the\nzero section, such that for all s \u2265 2n + 4, \u03c7s restricts to a diffeomorphism\n\u03c7s : U s \u2261 U \u2229 \u0393s (T M ) \u2192 Ds (M )\nbetween U s and a neighbourhood of the identity idM \u2208 Ds (M ).\nProof. First observe that a map F : M \u2192 M can be viewed as a section of the trivial fibre bundle\n\u03c0M : M \u00d7 M \u2192 M : (x, y) 7\u2192 x and that exp defines a smooth map of fibre bundles\neg\nxp : T M \u2192 M \u00d7 M : X 7\u2192 (\u03c0(X), exp(X))\nwhere \u03c0 : T M \u2192 M is projection onto the base point. Smoothness of \u03c7s then follows from\nProposition 2.3.5. Let Ur M = {(x, y) \u2208 M \u00d7 M : distM (x, y) < r}. Then eg\nxp : Br M \u2192 Ur M is a\nsmooth fibre bundle isomorphism. By Proposition 2.4.2, the restriction of \u03c7 to \u0393s -spaces\n\u03c7s : \u0393s (Br M ) \u2192 \u0393s (Ur M )\nis therefore a diffeomorphism. To complete the proof, let U denote the preimage of the open set\n\u03932n+4 (Ur M ) \u2229 D2n+4 (M ) under \u03c72n+4 .\n\u0003\nRemark 4.1.3. We can use \u03c7s to construct a smooth atlas for smooth manifold Ds (M ). Let G\nbe a smooth diffeomorphism of M . By Corollary 3.1.4, that composition on the left with G gives\na smooth diffeomorphism of Ds (M ). Consequently, the map\n\u03c7sG := LG \u25e6 \u03c7s : U s \u2192 Ds (M ) : X 7\u2192 G \u25e6 FX\nis a local diffeomorphism. Since the set of C \u221e diffeomorphisms of M is dense in Ds (M ), letting G\nrange over all diffeomorphisms gives a smooth atlas. Since composition of smooth maps is smooth,\nsmoothness of the transition functions is automatic.\nRemark 4.1.4. We recall the standard construction of the tangent bundle \u03c0D(M ) : T Ds (M ) \u2192\nDs (M ) (see [Ham, Pal] for background). To get a tangent vector to Ds (M ) at F0 \u2208 Ds (M ), let\nt 7\u2192 Ft be a smooth curve in Ds (M ) passing through F0 . Then Ft is a smooth family of C 1\ndiffeomorphisms, so we can differentiate pointwise with respect to t to obtain the vector field\nX : M \u2192 T M : x 7\u2192 \u1e1e0 (x) \u2208 T MF0 (x)\nover F0 , where we have used the notation \u1e1e0 (x) :=\nX\u2208\n\n\u0393s (M, T M )\n\ndFt (x)\n.\ndt\nt=0\n\nConversely, given a vector field\n\nwith \u03c0 \u25e6 X = F0 , observe that for small t the composition\ntX\n\nexp\n\nFt : M \u2212\u2192 T M \u2212\u2192 M\nis a smooth family in Ds (M ) and that X = \u1e1e0 . An easy way to obtain the manifold structure on\nthe total space T Ds (M ) is to note that by Corollary 2.4.5, composition with the projection map\n\u03c0 : T M \u2192 M induces a smooth map Ls\u03c0 : \u0393s (M, T M ) \u2192 \u0393s (M, M ).

Recall that a diffeomorphism F is a contact diffeomorphism if and only if the pullback F \u2217 \u03b7 is a multiple of \u03b7. Since this condition is\nequivalent to the equation \u03c0H (F \u2217 \u03b7) = 0, where \u03c0H : T \u2217 M \u2192 H \u2217 is the quotient map, the space of\n\u0393s -contact diffeomorphisms near the identity is parameterized by the subspace\n(4.2.1)\n\nV s \u2261 {X \u2208 U s : \u03c0H (FX\u2217 \u03b7) = 0} \u2282 \u0393s (T M ) .\n\nIt is convenient to view the equation \u03c0H (FX\u2217 \u03b7) = 0 in terms of the Rumin complex.

Next observe that \u03c0R = \u03c4 \u25e6 \u03c0H , where \u03c4 is the\nquotient map given by (2.6.1). Finally, since dR \u03b2 = \u03c0R (d\u03b2), the composition\nX 7\u2192 \u03c0H (FX\u2217 (d\u03b7)) 7\u2192 \u03c4 (\u03c0H (FX\u2217 d\u03b7)) = \u03c0R FX\u2217 (d\u03b7) = \u03c0R d(FX\u2217 \u03b7)\nis also a smooth differential operator of contact order 1.\n\n\u0003\n\nTo show that \u03c0H (FX\u2217 \u03b7) has the form of Equation (4.2.2), we work locally, choosing an adapted\natlas \u03c6\u03b1 : U\u03b1 \u2192 R2n+1 for M and a collection of open sets W\u03b1 b U\u03b1 covering M as in Section 1.1.\nBy compactness of M , there is a constant c > 0 such that exp(x, X) \u2208 U\u03b1 for all x \u2208 W\u03b1 , all\nX \u2208 T Mx , with |X| < c, and all \u03b1.\nLet X be a C 1 vector field with |X| < c. Fix a chart, say \u03c6\u03b1 , and set U = U\u03b1 and W = W\u03b1 .\nTo simplify notation, we adopt the Einstein summation conventions, letting Roman indices range\nk (x, X) (locally defined) on T M such that\nfrom 1 to 2n + 1.

Let \u03c8 be a smooth q-form on M and choose a coordinate patch U = U \u03b1 , with\nW = W\u03b1 b U . Let c > 0 be chosen so that exp(x, X) \u2208 U for all x \u2208 W and all X \u2208 Tx M with\n|X| < c. Then there are (locally defined) smooth fibre bundle maps\nQ1ij : BM |W \u2192 \u039bq M |W and Q2ij : BM |W \u2192 \u039bq\u22121 M\n\nW\n\n,\n\nwhere BM = {X \u2208 T M : |X| < c}, such that for any C 1 vector field X : M \u2192 BM \u2282 T M the\nequation\nFX\u2217 \u03c8 = \u03c8 + LX \u03c8 + Q1ij (X) X i X j + Q2ij (X) \u2227 X i dX j\nis satisfied on all of W .\nProof. Begin with the special case of a 0-form u \u2208 C \u221e (M, R). Then FX\u2217 u(x) = u\u25e6exp(x, X), and applying Taylor's formula with integral remainder to the function f (t) = u(x+tX +t2 Bij (x, tX)X i X j )\nand setting t = 1 yields the formula\n(u \u25e6 exp)(x, X) = u(x) + LX u(x) + Qij (x, X)X i X j ,\nfor Qij (x, X) smooth functions on BM |W , such that Qij = Qji . Next consider the special case\n\u03c8 = dxk , and compute as follows, using what we have just proved:\n\u0010\n\u0011\nFX\u2217 (dxk ) = d exp\u2217X xk\n\u0010\n\u0011\n= d xk + LX (xk ) + Qij (x, X)X i X j\n\u0001\n= dxk + LX dxk + d Qij (x, X)X i X j\n= dxk + LX dxk + d (Qij (x, X)) X i X j + 2Qij (x, X)X i dX j\n= dxk + LX dxk + Q1ij X i X j + Q2ij (x, X)X i dX j\n\u2202Q\n\nk\n\n\u2202(Qik X )\n\u2202Qik k\nk\n2\n+Qij . Because every p-form can be expressed as\nfor Q1ij = \u2202xij\nk dx , Qij = \u2202X j X +2Qij =\n\u2202X j\na linear combination of products of terms as above, the general result follows easily by induction. \u0003\n\n\fCONTACT DIFFEOMORPHISMS\n\n27\n\nRemark 4.2.8. Henceforth, we will use the notation\nQ\u03c8 (X) := FX\u2217 (\u03c8) \u2212 \u03c8 \u2212 LX \u03c8\nto denote the non-linear part of the pull-back FX\u2217 \u03c8. The Lemma states that in local coordinates\nQ\u03c8 (X) = Q1ij (X) X i X j + Q2ij (X) \u2227 X i dX j ,\nwhere Q1ij and Q2ij are smooth functions on BM |W \u2282 T M , which depend on the smooth form \u03c8.\n4.3. Parameterization of contact diffeomorphisms. The condition for FX to be a contact\ndiffeomorphism is the vanishing of the one-form FX\u2217 \u03b7 mod \u03b7. Remark 4.2.8 applied to \u03c8 = \u03b7 and\nthe identity \u03c0R \u03b7 = 0 show that FX is a contact diffeomorphism if and only if\n\u03c0R LX \u03b7 + \u03c0R Q\u03b7 (X) = 0 .\nSince Q\u03b7 (X) vanishes to second order at X = 0, the linearization of this equation is\n\u03c0R LX \u03b7 = 0 ,\ni.e., the condition that X be a contact vector field. This suggests using the implicit function\ntheorem in Banach spaces to construct a parameterization of the space of contact diffeomorphisms\nnear the identity by the space contact vector fields near zero.\nWe are going to construct a smooth map between Hilbert spaces of the form\n\u03a6 : \u0393s (T M ) \u2192 \u0393s+1 (M ) \u00d7 Hs : X 7\u2192 gX \u2295 \u03b3X ,\nwhere Hs is a second Hilbert space (to be determined), such that\n(i) FX is a contact diffeomorphism if and only if \u03b3X = 0,\n(ii) the derivative of \u03a6 is invertible at the origin.\nBy the inverse function theorem, \u03a6 is locally invertible and the map\n\u0001\ng 7\u2192 \u03c7s \u03a6\u22121 (g, 0)\ns\n(M ) near the identity by\ngives a smooth parameterization of the contact diffeomorphisms in Dcont\ns+1\nreal valued functions in \u0393 (M ) near zero.\nA natural guess for the map \u03a6 is\n\n(4.3.1)\n\nX = X 0 T + XH 7\u2192 (X 0 , \u03c0R FX\u2217 \u03b7) ,\n\nfor, as we have already observed, FX is contact if and only if \u03c0R FX\u2217 \u03b7 = 0, and X 0 parameterizes\ncontact vector fields (see Section 2.7). Unfortunately, this map is not invertible. Indeed, its\nlinearization at the origin involves a differential operator that loses too many derivatives.\nThe trick to circumventing this difficulty is to exploit some hidden smoothness in the Hodge\ndecomposition of one-forms in the Rumin complex. For smooth data, choose \u03a6 to be of the form\n(\nC \u221e (T M ) \u2192 C \u221e (M, R) \u2295 range(\u03b4R ) \u2295 ker(\u03b4R ) \u2282 C \u221e (M, R) \u2295 C \u221e (M, R) \u2295 R1\n\u03a6:\nX\n7\u2192 gX \u2295 \u03b1X \u2295 \u03c9X .\nWhen n > 1, the Hodge theory shows that the projection \u03c0R \u03b1 \u2208 R1 of a general one-form \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a91\nhas the decomposition\n\u03c0R \u03b1 = GR {(n \u2212 1) dR \u03b4R + n \u03b4R dR } \u03c0R \u03b1 + HR \u03c0R \u03b1\n= (n \u2212 1) GR dR \u03b4R \u03c0R \u03b1 + n GR \u03b4R \u03c0R d\u03b1 + HR \u03c0R \u03b1.\nApplying the commutation relations of Corollary 2.6.6(iii), gives\n\u03c0R \u03b1 = (n + 1) dR GR \u03b4R \u03c0R \u03b1 + n GR \u03b4R \u03c0R d\u03b1 + HR \u03c0R \u03b1 .\n\n\f28\n\nJ.

In the case n = 1, the map \u03a6 is, roughly speaking, the same as the map defined in\n[B]; however, in that paper, the use of the complex Laplacian and complex operators necessitated\nan additional splitting into real and imaginary parts-roughly doubling the number of terms.\nProposition 4.3.7.

Let F \u2208 \u0393s (M, M ), s \u2265 2n + 4, be a diffeomorphism, and let \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a9k be a smooth\nk-form, k \u2264 n. Then the form \u03c0R F \u2217 \u03b2 lies in \u0393s\u22121 (Rk ).\nProof. This is an immediate corollary to Example 2.5.9 (v) and the observation that for q \u2264 n,\n\u03c0R = \u03c4 \u25e6 \u03c0H where \u03c4 is the quotient map (2.6.1).\n\u0003\nLemma 4.3.9. Let n = 1 and let F : M \u2192 M be a \u0393s (possibly not contact) diffeomorphism, and\nlet s \u2265 6(= 2n + 4). Then DR \u03c0R F \u2217 \u03b7 is in \u0393s\u22122 (R2 ).\nProof. Recall the definition of the operator DR (see Section 2.6). For any \u03b1 \u2208 R1 \u2282 \u03a91 (M ),\nDR \u03b1 = d(e\n\u03b1 + f \u03b7), where \u03b1\ne \u2208 \u03a91 (M ) is any form such that \u03c0R (e\n\u03b1) = \u03b1 and f \u2208 R0 is the unique\nfunction such that \u03b7 \u2227 d(e\n\u03b1 + f \u03b7) = 0. Let \u039b be the linear isomorphism\n\u039b : R0 \u2192 R3 = \u03a93 (M ) : h 7\u2192 h\u03b7 \u2227 d\u03b7 .\nNote that \u039b is defined by a smooth vector bundle isomorphism; it, therefore, extends to an isomorphism between the spaces \u0393s (M ) and \u0393s (\u039b3 M ) for all s. Consider now the case \u03b1 = \u03c0R F \u2217 \u03b7. The\ncondition defining f is\n\u03b7 \u2227 (F \u2217 d\u03b7 + f d\u03b7) = 0 .\nBy Example 2.5.9(v), \u03b7 \u2227 F \u2217 d\u03b7 is in \u0393s\u22121 (R3 ), forcing f to be in \u0393s\u22121 (R0 ). Compute as follows\nDR (\u03c0R F \u2217 \u03b7) = dF \u2217 \u03b7 + d(f \u03b7) = F \u2217 d\u03b7 + df \u2227 \u03b7 + f d\u03b7 .\nSince wedging with \u03b7 kills all terms in df \u2227 \u03b7 involving differentiation in directions transverse to\nthe contact distribution, it follows that d(f \u03b7) is in \u0393s\u22122 (\u039b2 M ). Thus DR \u03b1 is in \u0393s\u22122 , concluding\nthe proof of the lemma.\n\u0003\nRemark 4.3.10. The result of Lemma 4.3.9 is somewhat surprising. Because \u03c0R F \u2217 \u03b7 is in \u0393s\u22121\nand DR is an operator of contact order 2, one would expect DR \u03c0R F \u2217 \u03b7 only to lie in \u0393s\u22123 .\nProof of Proposition 4.3.7. By Proposition 4.1.2, the map \u03c7s : X 7\u2192 FX is smooth; and for sufficiently small X, FX is a \u0393s -diffeomorphism. Recall that \u03c0R F \u2217 \u03b7 is in \u0393s\u22121 (R1 ).

For U sufficiently small, for all s \u2265 2n + 4 the set\nV s = {X \u2208 U s : \u03a6(X) = (gX , 0, 0)}\nis a smooth submanifold of U s := U \u2229 \u0393scont (T M ), smoothly parameterized by the map\n\u03a8 : \u0393scont (T M ) \u2229 U s \u2192 V s : X 7\u2192 \u03a6\u22121 (gX \u2295 0) .\nMoreover, the map \u03a8 is of the form\n\u03a8(X) = X + B(X)(X, X) ,\nwhere B : (\u0393scont (T M ) \u2229 U) \u00d7 \u0393scont (T M ) \u00d7 \u0393scont (T M ) \u2192 \u0393s (T M ) is smooth and bilinear in the last\ntwo factors.\nProof. It suffices to prove the theorem for s = 2n + 4. That V s \u2282 U s is a smooth submanifold\nfollows from Proposition 4.3.7 and the inverse function theorem in Banach spaces. To define \u03a8, let\n\u03c0 denote the projection\n(4.3.12)\n\n\u03c0(g, \u03b3) = (g, 0) ,\n\n\u0001\nin the notation in the statement of Proposition 4.3.7, and let \u03a8 = \u03a6\u22121 \u25e6 \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03a6 |\u0393scont (T M )\u2229U . The\nsmoothness of \u03a8 follows from the smoothness of \u03a6. A simple calculation shows that d\u03a8|0 (X) =\nX, for all X \u2208 \u0393scont (T M ), which (together with the inverse function theorem) shows that \u03a8\nparameterizes V s . The form of the operator B is given by Taylor's formula with integral remainder\nfor smooth operators on Banach spaces:\nZ 1\nB(X) =\n(1 \u2212 t)D2 \u03a8(tX) dt .\n0\n\n(See e.g. [Ham, Theorem 3.5.6].)\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 4.3.13. In view of the isomorphism \u0393s+1 (M ) ' \u0393scont (T M ) given by (2.7.2), the map\ng 7\u2192 \u03a8(Xg ) defines a smooth parameterization of V s by \u0393s+1 -functions in a neighbourhood of\n0 \u2208 \u0393s+1 (M, R).\n4.4. The smooth structure on the space of contact diffeomorphisms. The map \u03a8 of Theorem 4.3.7 gives a parameterization of the subspace V s \u2282 U s . We now show that this parameterizas\ntion in turn induces a smooth structure on the space Dcont\n(M ) of all \u0393s -contact diffeomorphisms.\nTheorem 4.4.1. Let (M, \u03b7) be a compact contact manifold. For s \u2265 2n+4, the space of \u0393s contact\ndiffeomorphisms is a smooth Hilbert manifold.\ns\nProof. We first show that the intersection of Dcont\n(M ) with a neighbourhood of the identity is a\ns\nsmooth submanifold of D (M ). To see this, let \u03c7s : U s \u2192 Ds (M ) be the diffeomorphism onto a\nneighbourhood of the identity given in Proposition 4.1.2. By Theorem 4.3.11, we can shrink U s if\n\n\fCONTACT DIFFEOMORPHISMS\n\n31\n\ns = \u03c7s (U s ). Since \u03c7s : U s \u2192 O s\nnecessary so that V s is a smooth submanifold of U s .

Noting that G \u2208 Ds (M ) is a contact diffeomorphism if and only if F \u22121 \u25e6 G is a\ncontact diffeomorphism shows that the equality\ns\nOFs \u2229 Dcont\n(M ) = F (V s )\n\nholds. Finally recall that composition on left with F is a smooth diffeomorphism of Ds (M ) (see\ns\nRemark (4.1.3)) to conclude that OFs \u2229 Dcont\n(M ) is a smooth submanifold of Ds (M ).\ns\nIt remains only to show that every element of Dcont\n(M ) is contained in OFs for some smooth\ns\ncontact diffeomorphism F . To see this, choose any G \u2208 Dcont\n(M ) and let Fk be a sequence of\nsmooth contact diffeomorphisms converging to G. Because composition and inversion are contins for k sufficiently large.\nuous operations, Fk\u22121 \u25e6 G \u2192 idM as k \u2192 \u221e. Therefore Fk\u22121 \u25e6 G \u2208 OId\ns\ns\n\u0003\nConsequently G is contained in OFk = Fk (OidM ) for k sufficiently large.\ns\nRemark 4.4.2. We can construct a smooth atlas for Dcont\n(M ) as follows. By Theorem 4.3.11 and\ns+1\nRemark 4.3.13, there is an open neighbourhood O\nof 0 \u2208 \u0393s+1 (M, R) such that\n\n(4.4.3)\n\ns+1\ns\n\u03c7s+1\n\u2192 Dcont\n(M ) : g 7\u2192 \u03c7s \u25e6 \u03a8s (Xg )\ncont : O\n\ns \u2229 Ds\nis a homeomorphism onto OId\ncont (M ). Its inverse is a coordinate chart centered at the identity\ndiffeomorphism.

The argument in the last paragraph of the proof\ns\nof Theorem 4.4.1 shows that the set of all such charts forms a smooth atlas for Dcont\n(M ).\ns\ns\n(M ) is a closed submanifold\n(M ). Because Dcont\nWe next address the global topology of T Dcont\ns\ns\ns\nof D (M ), there is a smooth inclusion T Dcont (M ) \u2282 T D (M ). Using the fact that Ds (M ) is an\nopen subset of \u0393s (M, M ), and letting \u0393s (M, |T M |) denote the space of \u0393s -maps from M into the\ntotal space of T M (i.e. forgetting the vector bundle structure on T M ), one sees immediately that\nthe tangent bundle of Ds (M ) is the open subset\n\nT Ds (M ) = {X \u2208 \u0393s (M, |T M |) : \u03c0 \u25e6 X \u2208 Ds (M )}\nwith bundle projection T Ds (M ) \u2192 Ds (M ) : X 7\u2192 \u03c0 \u25e6 X. A standard computation with Lie\nderivatives applied to a one-parameter family of contact diffeomorphisms then shows that a \u0393s s\ns\nvector field X : M \u2192 |T M | is in T Dcont\n(M ) if and only if F = \u03c0 \u25e6 X is Dcont\n(M ) and X \u25e6 F \u22121 \u2208\ns\ns\n\u0393 (T M ) is a contact vector field. As the next proposition shows, T Dcont (M ) is a trivial vector\nbundle:\nProposition 4.4.4.

Composition with a \u0393s -contact diffeomorphism is a continuous, but not differentiable, operation. Consequently, the trivialization in Proposition 4.4.4 is not smooth. We discuss\nthe smoothness of composition in Section 4.5.\n\n\f32\n\nJ. BLAND AND T. DUCHAMP\n\nProposition 4.4.4 is a corollary to a more general construction. Let \u03c0 : E \u2192 M be a smooth\nvector bundle over M , and let |E| denote the total space of E, viewed as a smooth manifold,\nforgetting its vector bundle structure. Recall that \u0393s (M, |E|) denotes the space of \u0393s -maps from\nM into |E|. Because \u03c0 is smooth, Corollary 2.4.5 applies to show that the map\nLs\u03c0 : \u0393s (M, |E|) \u2192 \u0393s (M, M ) : G 7\u2192 \u03c0 \u25e6 G .\ns\nis smooth. Let \u0393sDcont (M, E) = (Ls\u03c0 )\u22121 (Dcont\n(M )) \u2282 \u0393s (M, |E|) and let\ns\n\u03c0D : \u0393sDcont (M, E) \u2212\u2192 Dcont\n(M )\n\n(4.4.6)\n\nbe the restriction of Ls\u03c0 to \u0393sDcont (M, E). Notice that the vector bundle structure on E induces\ns\na vector space structure on the the fibres of \u03c0D , and we call \u03c0D : \u0393sDcont (M, E) \u2192 Dcont\n(M ) the\ns\n(vector) bundle of \u0393 -sections of E over contact diffeomorphisms.\nLemma 4.4.7. Let \u03c0 : E \u2192 M be a smooth vector bundle over M . Then for s \u2265 2n + 4, the\ns\nmap \u03a6E : Dcont\n(M ) \u00d7 \u0393s (E) \u2192 \u0393sDcont (M, E) : (F, \u03c3) 7\u2192 \u03c3 \u25e6 F is a continuous, vector bundle\nisomorphism between \u0393sDcont (M, E) and the trivial vector bundle.\nProof. Consider first the special case where E \u2192 M is the trivial bundle M \u00d7 Rr \u2192 M . The\ndiffeomorphism \u0393s (M, |M \u00d7 Rr |) ' \u0393s (M, M ) \u00d7 \u0393s (M, Rr ) restricts to a diffeomorphism\ns\n\u0393sDcont (M, M \u00d7 Rr ) ' Dcont\n(M ) \u00d7 \u0393s (M, Rr )\n\nwith respect to which \u03a6M \u00d7Rr assumes the form\ns\n\u03a6M \u00d7Rr : Dcont\n(M ) \u00d7 \u0393s (M, Rr ) \u2192 \u0393sDcont (M, M \u00d7 Rr ) : (F, \u03c3) 7\u2192 (F, \u03c3 \u25e6 F ) ,\n\nwith inverse\ns\nr\ns\ns\nr\n\u22121\n).\n\u03a6\u22121\nM \u00d7Rr : \u0393Dcont (M, M \u00d7 R ) \u2192 Dcont (M ) \u00d7 \u0393 (M, R ) : (F, \u03c3) 7\u2192 (F, \u03c3 \u25e6 F\n\nContinuity of \u03a6\u22121\nM \u00d7Rr follows from continuity of composition with F (see Corollary 3.1.4); and\n\u22121\ncontinuity of \u03a6M \u00d7Rr follows from continuity of inversion (see Theorem 3.2.5).\nNow consider the general case. By construction, \u03a6E is bijective, preserves basepoint, and is linear\non each fibre. To see that \u03a6E is continuous, note that since the map E \u2192 M \u00d7 E : e 7\u2192 (\u03c0(e), e)\nis smooth, so is the induced map\n\u03b9 : \u0393s (E) ,\u2192 \u0393s (M \u00d7 E)\ndefined by the formula \u03b9(\u03c3) : x 7\u2192 (x, \u03c3(x)). This observation, together with Corollary 2.4.5 implies\nr\ncontinuity of \u03a6E . It remains only to show that \u03a6\u22121\nE is continuous. Let j : E \u2192 M \u00d7 R be a smooth\nr\nvector bundle inclusion into a trivial bundle, and let s : M \u00d7 R \u2192 E be a smooth vector bundle\n\u22121\nmap with s \u25e6 j = idE .

For\ns\ns\ng \u2208 Os+1 , we denote by TFg Dcont\n(M ) the tangent space to Dcont\n(M ) at the contact diffeomorphism\ns+1\nFg , and for h \u2208 \u0393 (M, R), we set\nY(g,h) = D\u03c7s+1\ncontg (h) : M \u2192 T M ,\n\n\fCONTACT DIFFEOMORPHISMS\n\n33\n\ns\nwhere Y(g,h) \u2208 TFg Dcont\n(M ); and we set X(g,h) = Y(g,h) \u25e6 Fg\u22121 \u2208 \u0393scont (T M ).\n\nLemma 4.4.8.

Moreover, for every g \u2208 Os+1 and \u000f > 0, there is a \u03b4 > 0 such that\nkX(g1 ,h) \u2212 X(g,h) ks < \u000fkhks+1\nfor all g1 \u2208 Os+1 such that kg1 \u2212 gks+1 < \u03b4 and all h \u2208 \u0393s+2 (M, R).\nProof. Continuity of the map is clear. The estimate is the restatement of the fact that the derivative\nD\u03c7scont,g depends continuously on g.\n\u0003\n4.5. Differentiability of composition. We showed in Section 3 that composition\ns\n\u03bc : Dcont\n(M ) \u00d7 \u0393k (M, R) \u2192 \u0393k (M, R) : (F, u) 7\u2192 u \u25e6 F\n\nis a continuous operation for 2n + 4 \u2264 k \u2264 s, but composition is not C 1 , as the following counterexample shows. Choose u \u2208 \u0393k (M, R) with T (u) \u2208\n/ \u0393k (M R), where T is the Reeb vector field\non M . Then the one-parameter family Ft of contact diffeomorphisms given by the flow of the Reeb\ns\nvector field T is a smooth curve in Dcont\n(M ); and differentiability of \u03bc would imply that the limit\n\u03bc(u, Ft ) \u2212 \u03bc(u, F0 )\n= T (u)\nt\u21920\nt\nwould be an element of \u0393k (M, R). But this contradicts our choice of u. The next theorem shows\nthat we can recover smoothness by strengthening the regularity assumption on u.\nlim\n\nTheorem 4.5.1. Let M be a compact contact manifold of dimension 2n + 1 and let N be a smooth\nmanifold.

In case N = Rm , \u03bc is continuously differentiable\nfor 0 \u2264 k \u2264 s, 2n + 4 \u2264 s.\nProof. Assume that the theorem holds in the special case where N = Rm , with m arbitrary. Let\n\u03b9 : N ,\u2192 Rm be a closed embedding, and let U \u2282 Rm be a tubular neighbourhood of N , with\nprojection map \u03c0 : U \u2192 N .

Because \u0393k (M, Rm ) is the m-th fold\nproduct of \u0393k (M, R), we need only prove it for m = 1; and by Remark 4.4.2, it suffices to restrict\ns\nto an open neighbourhood of the identity in Dcont\n(M ).

Because \u03bc is a map between Banach spaces, to show that it is C 1 , we need only show that\nthe two partial derivatives of \u03bc with respect to the first and second variables\n\u0010\n\u0011\nD1 \u03bc : \u0393k+2 (M, R) \u00d7 Os+1 \u2192 L \u0393k+2 (M, R), \u0393k (M, R)\n\u0010\n\u0011\nD2 \u03bc : \u0393k+2 (M, R) \u00d7 Os+1 \u2192 L \u0393s+1 (M, R), \u0393k (M, R)\nexist and are continuous3. We shall obtain formulas for D1 \u03bc and D2 \u03bc. The formula for D\u03bc(u,g) (v, h)\nthen follows immediately from the well-known identity\nD\u03bc(u,g) (v, h) = D1 \u03bc(u,g) (v) + D2 \u03bc(u,g) (h) .\nTo see that D1 \u03bc exists, notice that by Corollary 3.1.4, \u03bc is continuous. The map \u03bc is linear\nin the first variable and, therefore, differentiable with respect to the first variable, with derivative\ngiven by D1 \u03bc(u,g) (v) = v \u25e6 Fg . Continuity of D1 \u03bc is proved in Lemma 4.5.4 below.\nWe next claim that\nD2 \u03bc(u,g) (h) = (X(g,h) du) \u25e6 Fg .\nTo prove the claim, first notice that because s \u2265 2n + 4, the functions g, h, u, as well as the map\nFg are of class at least C 1 . Moreover, because \u03c7s+1\ncont is smooth, the family t 7\u2192 Fg+th of contact\ndiffeomorphisms is a smooth family.

Some a priori estimates. Theorems 4.3.11 and 4.4.1 state that the nonlinear space of \u0393s\ncontact diffeomorphisms is a Hilbert manifold modelled on the linear space of \u0393s contact vector\nfields. In typical applications, one would like to study the action of the space of contact diffeomorphisms on some set of structures by comparing it with the linearized action of contact vector\nfields. For this strategy to work, it is necessary to show that the error incurred in the linearization\nis quadratically small in an appropriate sense. This is the content of the next proposition, which\ngives a priori estimates for the quadratic error \u03a8(X) \u2212 X = B(X)(X, X). We require this result in\n[BD3] to obtain normal forms for CR structures on compact three dimensional contact manifolds.\nProposition 4.6.1.

The first is a corollary to Lemma 4.2.7 and compactness\nof M . (See Remark 4.2.8 for the definition of Q.)\nLemma 4.6.2.

Choose an adapted atlas and a constant c > 0 as in the discussion above Lemma 4.2.7. The\ninequalities (i) and (ii) follow from the definition of Q\u03c8 . To prove (iii), note that by Lemma 4.2.7,\n\u03c0R \u25e6 Q\u03c8 is a smooth differential operator of contact order 1; the inequality then follows. The\ninequality (iv) follows from the smooth dependence of Q\u03c8 (X) on X.\n\u0003\nLemma 4.6.3. Choose c > 0 as in the previous lemma.

We first claim that \u03a6(Y2 \u2212Y1 ) = \u03c0 \u22a5 \u25e6\u03a6(Y2 \u2212Y1 ).\nTo see this, use the definition \u03a8(X) = \u03a6\u22121 \u25e6 \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03a6(X) for any vector field X and the linearity of\nthe map \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03a6 to write \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03a6(Yi ) in the form\n\u03c0 \u25e6 \u03a6(Yi ) = \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03a6(\u03a8(Xi ) \u2212 Xi ) = \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03a6(\u03a6\u22121 \u25e6 \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03a6(Xi )) \u2212 \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03a6(Xi ) = 0 .\nIt follows that \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03a6(Y2 \u2212 Y1 ) = 0; hence, \u03c0 \u22a5 \u25e6 \u03a6(Y2 \u2212 Y1 ) = \u03a6(Y2 \u2212 Y1 ). Next, since \u03a8(X) =\n\u03a6\u22121 \u25e6 \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03a6(X), we have\n\u03c0 \u22a5 \u25e6 \u03a6 \u25e6 \u03a8(Xi ) = \u03c0 \u22a5 \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03a6(Xi ) = 0 .\nCombining these two identities shows the second term in (4.6.6) can be written\n\u03a6(Y2 \u2212 Y1 ) + (\u03c0 \u22a5 \u25e6 \u03a6(X2 ) \u2212 \u03c0 \u22a5 \u25e6 \u03a6(X1 ))\n= \u03c0 \u22a5 {\u03a6(Y2 \u2212 Y1 ) + (\u03a6(X2 ) \u2212 \u03a6(\u03a8(X2 )) \u2212 \u03a6(X1 ) + \u03a6(\u03a8(X1 ))} .\nWe now show that\n(4.6.7) \u03c0 \u22a5 {\u03a6(Y2 \u2212 Y1 ) + (\u03a6(X2 ) \u2212 \u03a6(\u03a8(X2 )) \u2212 \u03a6(X1 ) + \u03a6(\u03a8(X1 ))}\n= L (Q\u03b7 (Y2 \u2212 Y1 ) \u2212 (Q\u03b7 (\u03a8(X2 )) \u2212 Q\u03b7 (\u03a8(X1 ))) + (Q\u03b7 (X2 ) \u2212 Q\u03b7 (X1 )))\nwhere L is the linear operator defined by\n(\n\u2217 D + H )} \u25e6 \u03c0 (\u03c6) ,\n{(n + 1) GR \u03b4R \u2295 (GR DR\nR\nR\nR\nL(\u03c6) :=\n{(n + 1) GR \u03b4R \u2295 (n GR \u03b4R dR + HR )} \u25e6 \u03c0R (\u03c6) ,\n\nfor n = 1\nfor n > 1 .\n\nTo see this, apply Lemma 4.2.7 with \u03c6 = \u03b7 to the vector fields Y2 \u2212 Y1 , Xi and \u03a8(Xi ) to obtain\nthe three expansions\nFX\u2217 i \u03b7 = \u03b7 + LXi \u03b7 + Q\u03b7 (Xi )\n\u2217\nF\u03a8(X\n\u03b7 = \u03b7 + L\u03a8(Xi ) \u03b7 + Q\u03b7 (\u03a8(Xi ))\ni)\n\u2217\nF(Y\n\u03b7 = LY2 \u03b7 \u2212 LY1 \u03b7 + Q\u03b7 (Y2 \u2212 Y1 ) .\n2 \u2212Y1 )\n\nSubstituting these expressions into Equation (4.6.5) and collecting terms reveals that the terms\ninvolving the Lie derivative of \u03b7 cancel to yield the identity (4.6.7). Thus, by the triangle inequality,\nto estimate the second term in (4.6.6), we need only estimate each term in the sum\n|||L(Q\u03b7 (Y2 \u2212 Y1 ))|||s + |||L(Q\u03b7 (\u03a8(X2 )) \u2212 Q\u03b7 (\u03a8(X1 )))|||s + |||L(Q\u03b7 (X2 ) \u2212 Q\u03b7 (X1 ))|||s\nFor each term, we use the estimates\n(\nk\u03c0R \u03c6ks\u22121 + kDR \u03c0R \u03c6ks\u22122 + kHR \u03c0R \u03c6ks ,\n|||L(\u03c6)|||s \u227a\nk\u03c0R \u03c6ks\u22121 + kdR \u03c0R \u03c6ks\u22121 + kHR \u03c0R \u03c6ks ,\n\nfor n = 1\nfor n > 1 .\n\nNoting the degree of the various linear operators in the definition of L and employing Lemmas 4.6.2\nand 4.6.3 shows that\n|||L(Q\u03b7 (Y2 \u2212 Y1 ))|||s \u227a(kY2 \u2212 Y1 ks )kY2 \u2212 Y1 ks\u22121 ,\n|||L(Q\u03b7 (\u03a8(X2 )) \u2212 Q\u03b7 (\u03a8(X1 )))|||s \u227a(k\u03a8(X1 )ks + k\u03a8(X2 )ks ) * k\u03a8(X2 ) \u2212 \u03a8(X1 )ks\u22121\n+ (k\u03a8(X1 )ks\u22121 + k\u03a8(X2 )ks\u22121 ) * k\u03a8(X2 ) \u2212 \u03a8(X1 )ks ,\n\n\fCONTACT DIFFEOMORPHISMS\n\n41\n\nand\n|||L(Q\u03b7 (X2 ) \u2212 Q\u03b7 (X1 ))|||s \u227a(kX1 ks + kX2 ks ) * kX2 \u2212 X1 ks\u22121\n+ (kX1 ks\u22121 + kX2 ks\u22121 ) * kX2 \u2212 X1 ks\nTo conclude the estimate of (4.6.6), note that since \u03a8 is C 1 , we can replace \u03a8(Xi ) by Xi and\nY2 \u2212 Y1 by X2 \u2212 X1 everywhere in the first two of the previous three inequalities.\n\u0003\nReferences\n[Arn] V.
