This proves the lemma.\nBefore proving the main result, we show that regular two\nedge type LDPC ensembles {l1 , l2 , r, r} have the same\ngrowth rate of the average stopping set distribution as that\nof the standard regular {l1 + l2 , r} LDPC ensemble.\nLemma II.4. Consider the {l1 , l2 , r, r} regular two edge\ntype LDPC ensemble with blocklength n, l1 \u2265 3, and\npositive design rate. Let N (n, \u03c9n) be the stopping set distribution of a randomly chosen code from this ensemble and\nlet E(N (n, \u03c9n)) be its average. Then the growth rate of\nE(N (n, \u03c9n)) is the same as that of the standard regular\n{l1 + l2 , r} ensemble. In particular, the minimum stopping\nset distance of the {l1 , l2 , r, r} regular two edge type LDPC\nensemble grows linearly in n.\nProof: Using standard counting arguments we obtain\nE(N (n, \u03c9n)) =\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0012 \u0013 coef p(r) (x) l1rn , x\u03c9l1 n coef p(r) (x) l2rn , x\u03c9l2 n\nn\n\u0001 l2 n \u0001\n,\nl1 n\nn\u03c9\n\u03c9l1 n \u03c9l2 n\n(10)\nwhere p(r) (x) = (1+x)r \u2212rx.

Now, the linearity of\nminimum stopping set distance immediately follows from [24,\nCor. 7].\nRemark: We could have come to this conclusion by specializing the general result contained in [25, Thm. 5]. But for\nthe convenience of the reader, and since the above proof is so\nshort, we decided to include a complete proof.\nLemma II.4 and [17, Lemma 1] imply that\n{l1 , l2 , r, r, L, w} spatially coupled two edge type LDPC\nensembles with variable node degree at least three have a\nlinear minimum stopping set distance. This gives us the\nfollowing lemma on the block error probability of the\n{l1 , l2 , r, r, L, w} ensemble under iterative decoding.\nLemma II.5. Consider transmission over the BEC(\u01eb) using\nthe {l1 , l2 , r, r, L, w}, spatially coupled two edge type LDPC\nensembles with BP threshold \u01eb\u2217 and blocklength n. Let l1 \u2265 3.\n(B)\nAssume that \u01eb < \u01eb\u2217 . Denote by Pe the block error probability under iterative decoding. Then\nlim nPe(B) = 0.\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nProof: In fact, a much stronger result is true \u2013 the block\nerror probability converges to 0 exponentially fast. But for\nour purpose we only need that it converges to zero faster than\nlinearly.\nTo see why this is correct, fix \u01eb < \u01eb\u2217 . Then, for any \u03b4 > 0,\nthere exists an l so that after l iterations of DE, the bit error\nprobability is below \u03b4/3. Further, for n = n(l), sufficiently\nlarge, the expected behavior over all instances of the code and\nthe channel deviates from the density evolution predictions\nby at most \u03b4/3. Finally, by standard concentration results\n(see [23, Thm. 3.30]) it follows that the probability that a\nparticular instance deviates more than \u03b4/3 from its average\ndecays exponentially fast in the blocklength.\nWe summarize, with a probability which converges exponentially fast (in the blocklength) to 1, an individual instance\nwill have reached a bit error probability of at most \u03b4 after a\nfixed number of iterations.\nIf \u03b4 is chosen sufficiently small, in particular smaller than\nthe relative minimum stopping set distance, then we know that\nthe decoder can correct the remaining erasures with probability\n1.\nIn the following lemma we calculate the design rate of the\nspatially coupled two edge type ensemble.\nLemma II.6 (Design Rate). The design rate of the spatially\ncoupled two edge type ensemble ({l1 , l2 , r1 , r2 , L, w}) with\n\n\fw \u2264 2L is given by\nR(l1 , l2 , r1 , r2 , L, w) =\nPw\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\nl1\nl2\nl2 w + 1 \u2212 2 i=0\nl1\n1\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\nr1\nr2\nr1\nr2\n2L + 1\n\n(13)\n\u0001\ni r\nw\n\n.\n\n(14)\n\nThe design rate of the coset encoding scheme for the wiretap\nchannel is given by\n\u0001r\nPw\nl2 w + 1 \u2212 2 i=0 wi\nl2\n\u2212\n.\n(15)\nRdes =\nr2\nr2\n2L + 1\n\nProof: Let C1 (C2 ) be the number of type one (two) check\nnodes connected to variable nodes and let V be the number\nof variable nodes. Then R(l1 , l2 , r1 , r2 , L, w) = 1 \u2212 C1 /V \u2212\nC2 /V and Rdes = C2 /V . The calculations then follow from\nthe proof of [17, Lemma 3].\nThe number of possible messages s of the coset encoding\n(1,2)\n(1)\nscheme is given by the number of cosets of Gn in Gn . For\na standard LDPC ensemble the design rate is a lower bound on\nthe rates of the codes in the ensemble. This is not true for the\ncoset encoding scheme for the wiretap channel. For example,\n(1)\nsuppose the rate of Gn equals the design rate, but the rate of\n(1,2)\nis higher than its design rate. Then there will be fewer\nGn\ncosets than the maximum possible value. This corresponds to\nthe equation\n\u0014 \u0015\nH1\nX = [0 * * * 0S]T .\nH2\nnot having solutions for some S.\nNow, we are ready to state one of our main theorems. It\nshows that, by spatial coupling of two edge type LDPC codes,\nwe can achieve perfect secrecy (the branch AB in Figure 2),\nand in particular the secrecy capacity (the point B in Figure 2)\nof the binary erasure wiretap channel.\n\nTheorem\nII.7. Consider\ntransmission\nover\nthe\nBEC-WT(\u01ebm , \u01ebw )\nusing\nspatially\ncoupled\nregular\n{l1 , l2 , r, r, L, w} two edge type LDPC ensemble.

As R < Cm \u2212 Cw , we see that the threshold\nis greater than \u01ebm .

N UMERICAL R ESULTS\nWe have rigorously shown the optimality of the\n{l1 , l2 , r1 , r2 , L, w} ensemble. In this section, we briefly\ndiscuss the performance of the {l1 , l2 , r1 , r2 , L} ensemble,\nwhich is the two edge type extension of the {l, r, L} ensemble\ndiscussed in [17, Sec. II.A]. Based on the method in [22], we\nnumerically evaluate the equivocation of the {3, 3, 6, 12, L}\nensemble for the BEC-WT(0.5, 0.75). The results are given\nin Table I. We observe that as L increases, the equivocation\nRe converges to R, the rate from Alice to Bob. Thus, the\n\noptimality of secrecy performance of the {l1 , l2 , r1 , r2 , L}\nensemble seems to hold for the wiretap channel. The optimality of reliability performance has been conjectured to hold in\n[17].\nL\nR\nRe\n\n20\n0.2622\n0.2276\n\n30\n0.2582\n0.235\n\n40\n0.2562\n0.2387\n\n50\n0.255\n0.241\n\n60\n0.2541\n0.2425\n\n70\n0.2535\n0.2436\n\nTABLE I\nR ATE FROM A LICE TO B OB (R) AND EQUIVOCATION OF E VE (Re ) FOR\nDIFFERENT VALUES OF L, M = 1000 FOR {3, 3, 6, 12, L} ENSEMBLE .\n\nIV.

As the spatially\ncoupled two edge type LDPC codes are conjectured to achieve\ncapacity over general BMS channels, we conjecture that our\ncode construction is also universally optimal for the class\nof wiretap channel where the main channel and wiretapper's\nchannel are BMS channels and wiretapper's channel is physically degraded with respect to the main channel.\nR EFERENCES\n[1] A.
