We include the\nfollowing improvements over previous determinations: the consideration of the temperature\ninhomogeneities that affects the helium and heavy elements abundance determinations, the\nderivation of the O and C abundances from recombination line intensities, the consideration\nof the collisional excitation of the triplet He I lines from the 23 S level by determining the\nhelium abundance from many line intensity ratios, and the study of the 23 S level optical\ndepth effects on the intensity of the triplet lines by observing a large number of singlet and\ntriplet lines of He I.\nWe are interested in three applications based on the abundance determinations: the\ndetermination of t2 , the comparison of the nebular abundances derived in this paper with\nthe stellar abundances of supergiant stars in NGC 6822 derived elsewhere (Muschielok et al.\n1999; Venn et al. 2001; Venn & Miller 2002; Venn et al. 2004), and to provide accurate\nabundances for galactic chemical evolution models of this object (e. g. Carigi et al. 2005a).\nNGC 6822 is an irregular galaxy member of the local group particularly suited for\nchemical evolution models because its star formation history is well known (Wyder 2001),\nand apparently has not been affected by tidal effects, therefore its chemical composition\nmight permit to decide if outflows to the intergalactic medium have occurred in this galaxy.\nThe importance of outflows to the intergalactic medium from nearby irregular galaxies\ndepends on many factors, like their total mass, the distribution in time and space of their\nstar formation, and tidal effects (e.g. Legrand et al. 2001; Tenorio-Tagle et al. 2003; Martin\n2003; Fragile et al. 2004, and references therein).\nNGC 6822 apparently has not been affected by tidal effects from the main galaxies of\nthe local group: the Milky Way and M31 (Sawa & Fujimoto 2005). NGC 6822 is located\nat 495 kpc from our Galaxy and is moving away from it at a radial velocity of 44 km s\u22121\n(Trimble 2000). NGC 6822 is also located at 880 kpc from M31, and it is separated from\nM31 by more than 90 degrees in the sky (Trimble 2000).\nIn sections 2 and 3 the observations and the reduction procedure are described. In\nsection 4 temperatures and densities are derived from four and three different intensity\nratios respectively; also in this section, the mean square temperature fluctuation, t2 , is\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\ndetermined from the O II/[O III] line intensity ratios and from the difference between T (He I)\nand T ([O III+O II]). In section 5 we determine ionic abundances based on recombination\nlines that are almost independent of the temperature structure, we determine also ionic\nabundances based on ratios of collisionally excited lines to recombination lines that do depend\non the temperature structure of the nebula. In section 6 we determine the total abundances.\nIn sections 7 and 8 we present the discussion and the conclusions.\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nThe observations were obtained with the Focal Reducer Low Dispersion Spectrograph\n1, FORS1, at the VLT Melipal Telescope in Chile. We used three grisms: GRIS\u2212 600B+12,\nGRIS\u2212 600R+14 with filter GG435, and GRIS\u2212 300V with filter GG375 (see Table 1).\nThe slit was oriented almost east-west (position angle 91o ) to observe the brightest\nregions of NGC 6822 V and of 6822 X simultaneously. The linear atmospheric dispersion\ncorrector, LACD, was used to keep the same observed region within the slit regardless of the\nair mass value. The slit width was set to 0.51\" and the slit length was 410\". The aperture\nextractions were made for an area of 22.4\" \u00d7 0.51\" for region V and an area of 24.6\" \u00d7 0.51\"\nfor region X, covering the brightest parts of both regions (see Figure 1). The resolution for\nthe emission lines observed with the blue grism is given by \u2206\u03bb \u223c \u03bb/1300, with the red grism\nis given by \u2206\u03bb \u223c \u03bb/1700, and with the low resolution grism is given by \u2206\u03bb \u223c \u03bb/700. The\naverage seeing during the observations amounted to 0.8\".\nThe spectra were reduced using IRAF2 reduction packages, following the standard procedure of bias subtraction, aperture extraction, flatfielding, wavelength calibration and flux\ncalibration. For flux calibration the standard stars LTT 2415, LTT 7389, LTT 7987 and\nEG 21 were used (Hamuy et al. 1992, 1994). The observed spectra are presented in Figures\n2 and 3.\n\n3.\n\nLine Intensities, Reddening Correction, and Radial Velocities\n\nLine intensities were measured integrating all the flux in the line between two given\nlimits and over a local continuum estimated by eye. In the few cases of line-blending, the\nline flux of each individual line was derived from a multiple Gaussian profile fit procedure.\nAll these measurements were carried out with the splot task of the IRAF package.\n2\n\nIRAF is distributed by NOAO, which is operated by AURA, under cooperative agreement with NSF.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nThe reddening coefficients, C(H\u03b2)'s, were determined by fitting the observed I(H\u03b2)/I(H\nBalmer lines) ratios to the theoretical ones computed by Storey & Hummer (1995) for Te =\n10,000 K and Ne = 100 cm\u22123 , (see below) and assuming the extinction law of Seaton (1979).\nTable 2 presents the emission line intensities of the NGC 6822 H II regions. The first\ntwo columns include the adopted laboratory wavelength, \u03bb, and the identification for each\nline. The third and fourth columns include the observed flux relative to H\u03b2, F (\u03bb), and\nthe flux corrected for reddening relative to H\u03b2, I(\u03bb), for region V. The last two columns\ninclude the same information as the previous two but for region X. To combine all the line\nintensities, from the three different instrumental settings, on the same scale, we multiplied\nthe intensities in each setting by a correction factor obtained from the lines present in more\nthan one setting. The errors were estimated by comparing all the measured H line intensities,\nwith those predicted by the computations of Storey & Hummer (1995) and by assuming that\nthe signal to noise increases as the square root of the measured flux. These estimates are in\nagreement with the differences found when comparing the line fluxes observed in different\nexposures.\n\n4.\n4.1.\n\nPhysical Conditions\n\nTemperatures and densities\n\nThe temperatures and densities presented in Table 3 were derived from the line intensities presented in Table 2. The determinations were carried out based on the temden IRAF\nsubroutine; this subroutine models a 5-, 6-, or 8-level ion to derive these quantities.\nTo compute T ([O II]), the contribution to the intensities of the \u03bb\u03bb 7319, 7320, 7331,\nand 7332 [O II] lines due to recombination was taken into account based on the following\nequation:\nIR (7319 + 7320 + 7331 + 7332)/I(H\u03b2) = 9.36(T /104)0.44 \u00d7 O++ /H+\n\n(1)\n\n(see Liu et al. 2000).\nSimilarly, to compute T ([N II]), the contribution to the intensity of the \u03bb 5755 [N II]\nline due to recombination was taken into account based on the following equation:\nIR (5755)/I(H\u03b2) = 3.19(T /104)0.30 \u00d7 N++ /H+\n(see Liu et al. 2000).\n\n(2)\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n4.2.\n\nTemperature variations\n\nTo derive the ionic abundance ratios the average temperature, T0 , and the mean square\ntemperature fluctuation, t2 , were used. These quantities are given by\nR\nTe (r)Ne (r)Ni (r)dV\nT0 (Ne , Ni ) = R\n(3)\nNe (r)Ni (r)dV\nand\n\nt2 =\n\nR\n\n(Te \u2212 T0 )2 Ne Ni dV\nR\n,\nT02 Ne Ni dV\n\n(4)\n\nrespectively, where Ne and Ni are the electron and the ion densities of the observed emission\nline and V is the observed volume (Peimbert 1967).\nTo determine T0 and t2 we need two different methods to derive Te : one that weighs\npreferentially the high temperature regions and one that weighs preferentially the low temperature regions (Peimbert 1967). In this paper we have used the temperature derived from\nthe ratio of the [O III] \u03bb\u03bb 4363, 5007 lines, T(4363/5007) , that is given by\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0015\n1 91300\nT(4363/5007) = T0 1 +\n(5)\n\u2212 3 t2\n2\nT0\nand the temperature derived from the ratio of the recombination lines of multiplet 1 of O II\nto the collisionally excited lines of [O III] that is given by (see Peimbert et al. 2004, equations\n8-12)\nT(O II rec/O III coll) = T(4649/5007) = f1 (T0 , t2 ).\n(6)\nUsing the O recombination lines of Region V, based on these equations, we obtain\nT0 = 10100 K and t2 = 0.092 \u00b1 0.026. Since in this object most of the oxygen is twice ionized\n(see section 5.3), this t2 value is representative for the whole H II region.\nIt is also possible to derive the t2 value from the analysis of the helium lines (see section\n5.1). The resulting values are: t2 = 0.060 \u00b1 0.026 and 0.056 \u00b1 0.045 for regions V and X\nrespectively. For region V we combine the oxygen and the helium determinations and adopt\nt2 = 0.076 \u00b1 0.018; for region X we simply adopt the t2 helium determination. The t2 values\nderived for regions V and X are somewhat larger than those derived for Galactic H II regions,\nthat typically are in the 0.03 to 0.04 range (Esteban et al. 2005) but are similar to those\nderived in giant extragalactic H II regions (Esteban et al. 2002; Peimbert 2003).\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n5.\n\nIonic Chemical Abundances\n\n5.1.\n\nHelium ionic abundances\n\nTo obtain He+ /H+ values we need a set of effective recombination coefficients for the He\nand H lines, the contribution due to collisional excitation to the helium line intensities, and\nan estimate of the optical depth effects for the helium lines. The recombination coefficients\nused were those by Storey & Hummer (1995) for H, and those by Smits (1996) and Benjamin,\nSkillman, & Smits (1999) for He. The collisional contribution was estimated from Sawey &\nBerrington (1993) and Kingdon & Ferland (1995). The optical depth effects in the triplet\nlines were estimated from the computations by Benjamin, Skillman, & Smits (2002).\nBefore using the helium lines, much in the same way as we do for hydrogen lines, we\nneed to correct them for underlying absorption and, in the cases of \u03bb 3889 and \u03bb 4713,\nfor blends. To correct the blue lines, \u03bb < 5000 \u00c5, for underlying absorption we used the\nvalues determined by Gonz\u00e1lez Delgado et al. (1999), for the redder lines we used values\ndetermined by Cervi\u00f1o M. (private communication) based on the paper by Gonz\u00e1lez Delgado\net al. (2005). It should be noted that the underlying absorption in the helium lines scales,\nin the same way as it does in the hydrogen lines, as a fraction of the correction to H\u03b2. After\ndiscarding the lines that could not be easily unblended or those for which there is no accurate\natomic data, the remaining lines are presented in Table 4.\nWe have many measured helium lines, each of them with a different dependence on\ntemperature and density. In principle one can find He I line ratios that will allow to measure\ntemperature or density. In practice the dependence of each ratio is weak, also each ratio\ndepends simultaneously on T0 , t2 , Ne , and \u03c43889 ; making the determinations, obtained from\nany one ratio, to have large error bars. In order to optimize our data we used a maximum\nlikelihood method (MLM) to search for the physical and chemical conditions (T0 , t2 , \u03c43889 ,\nand He+ /H+ ) that would give us the best simultaneous fit to all the measured lines (see\nPeimbert, Peimbert, & Ruiz 2000).\nFor these objects the MLM can not determine the electron density with high enough\naccuracy to be useful; therefore we have adopted the electron densities derived from collisionally excited lines. Based on Table 3 we adopted Ne = 175 \u00b1 30 cm\u22123 and Ne = 30 \u00b1 30 cm\u22123 ,\nfor regions V and X respectively, to help with the determinations.\nTo help break the degeneracy on T0 and t2 we need to use an additional temperature;\nsince T (He I) weighs preferentially the low temperature regions, we used a temperature\nthat weighs preferentially the high temperature regions (see section 4.2). In order for this\ntemperature to be representative of the whole region we used a weighted average of T ([O II])\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nand T ([O III]) (see Peimbert et al. 2002): for region V we used T ([O III+O II])= 12000 K\nand for region X we usedT ([O III+O II])= 12250 K.\nFrom these line intensities, densities, temperatures and the MLM we obtained the He\nabundances presented in Table 5, a t2 = 0.060 \u00b1 0.026 for region V, and a t2 = 0.056 \u00b1 0.045\nfor region X.\n\n5.2.\n\nC and O ionic abundances from recombination lines\n\nThe C++ abundance was derived from the \u03bb4267 \u00c5 line of C II and the effective recombination coefficients computed by Davey, Storey, & Kisielius (2000) for Case A and\nT = 10, 000 K. We only observe the \u03bb4267 \u00c5 line in region V, the expected flux of this line\nfor region X would produce a S/N\u22481, making it impossible to measure.\nThe O++ abundance was derived from multiplet 1 of O II (Peimbert, Storey, & TorresPeimbert 1993; Storey 1994). The multiplet consists of 8 lines and the sum of their intensities,\nI(sum), normalized to I(H\u03b2), is independent of the electron density. On the other hand the\nnormalized intensity of each of the eight lines does depend on the electron density (Ruiz et\nal. 2003). It is rarely possible to measure all the lines of this multiplet, and frequently it is\nnecessary to estimate the intensities of the unobserved (or blended) lines.\nAs with C II, we only observe O II recombination lines on region V. Of the 8 lines of\nmultiplet 1 we only detect 4; which, due to the dispersion of our observations, are blended\ninto 2 pairs \u03bb\u03bb 4639+42 and 4649+51 \u00c5.\nRuiz et al. (2003) found that, for typical H II region densities, the relative intensities\nof the lines of the multiplet deviate from the LTE computation predictions. In order to\ndetermine what fraction of the intensity of the whole multiplet is emitted in these 4 lines it\nis necessary to determine the density dependence of each of these lines. Ruiz et al. present\nthe density dependence of I(4649)/I(sum). In order to determine the density relations, for\nall the lines of the multiplet, in Figures 4, 5, 6, and 7 we present plots of the data listed by\nRuiz et al. in their Table 8 for the four sets of lines of multiplet 1 that originate in a given\nupper level (note that our Figure 7 is the same as Figure 2 by Ruiz et al.). From Figures\n4 to 7 it can be seen that the intensity of the lines that originate in the 3p 4 D03/2 and 3p\n4 0\nD1/2 energy levels decreases with increasing local density, while the intensity of those lines\nthat originate in the 3p 4 D07/2 increases with increasing density. This is due to the effect of\ncollisional redistribution that increases the population of the high statistical weight levels\nat the expense of the low statistical weight ones. Note that the intensity of the lines that\noriginate from the 3p 4 D05/2 energy level depend weakly on the electron density.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nBased on Figures 4 to 7 and a relationship of the type\ni\ni\nh\nh\nI(line)\nI(line)\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u2212 I(sum)\nI(sum)\nI(line)\nI(line)\nh cas\ni LT E ,\n=\n+\nNe (FL)\nI(sum) obs\nI(sum) LT E\n1 + Ne (crit)\nwe have obtained the following equations:\n\u0014\n\u0015\nI(4651 + 74)\n0.144\n= 0.101 +\n,\nI(sum)\n[1 + Ne (FL)/1325]\nobs\n\u0015\n\u0014\n0.205\nI(4639 + 62 + 96)\n= 0.201 +\n,\nI(sum)\n[1 + Ne (FL)/1325]\nobs\n\u0015\n\u0014\n0.057\nI(4642 + 76)\n= 0.301 \u2212\n,\nI(sum)\n[1 + Ne (FL)/1325]\nobs\nand\n\n\u0014\n\nI(4649)\nI(sum)\n\n\u0015\n\n= 0.397 \u2212\nobs\n\n0.292\n,\n[1 + Ne (FL)/1325]\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\nwhere the first term on the right hand side corresponds to the LTE ratio presented by\nWiese et al. (1996) and the second term takes into account the deviation from LTE. The\nintensity of the lines originating from the same upper level is constant and depends only on\nthe ratio of the Einstein A coefficients for each level; thus I(4651):I(4674) is 0.844:0.156,\nI(4639):I(4662):I(4696) is 0.455:0.506:0.039, and I(4642):I(4676) is 0.742:0.258; since \u03bb4649\n\u00c5 is the only line originating from the 3p 4 D07/2 upper level it will contain all the photons\noriginating from this level.\nBased on equations 8 to 11, the relative intensities of the lines originating from the same\nupper level, and the O II lines presented in Table 2 we have determined the I(sum) value for\nmultiplet 1 which amounts to I(sum)/ I(H\u03b2)=0.0023 . We have derived the O++ abundance\npresented in Table 5 from I(sum) and the effective recombination coefficient for multiplet 1\ncomputed by Storey (1994) under the assumption of Case B for Te = 10, 000 K and Ne =\n100 cm\u22123 .\n\n5.3.\n\nIonic abundances from collisionally excited lines\n\nThe values presented in Table 6 for t2 = 0.00 were derived with the IRAF task abund,\nusing only the low- and medium-ionization zones. abund requires as inputs a temperature\nand a density for each zone as well as the intensities of the observed collisionally excited\nlines relative to H\u03b2. These values are combined with a model of a 5-, 6-, or 8-level ion\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nto determine the abundances. The low and medium ionization zones of abund correspond\nto the low and high ionization zones of this paper. For Region V we used Tlow = 13000 K,\nThigh = 11900 K, and Ne low = Ne high = 175 cm\u22123 ; and for Region X we used Tlow = 13300 K,\nThigh = 12000 K, and Ne low = Ne high = 30 cm\u22123 .\nTo derive the abundances for t2 > 0.00 we used the abundances for t2 = 0.00 corrected\nby the formulation for t2 > 0.00 presented by Peimbert & Costero (1969) (see also Peimbert\net al. 2004). To derive abundances for other t2 values it is possible to interpolate or to\nextrapolate the values presented in Table 6.\n\n6.\n\nTotal Abundances\n\nTo obtain the C and N gaseous abundances the following equations were adopted\n\nand\n\nN(C)\nN(C++ )\n= ICF (C)\nN(H)\nN(H+ )\n\n(12)\n\nN(N)\nN(N+ )\n= ICF (N)\n,\nN(H)\nN(H+ )\n\n(13)\n\nthe ICF (C) value was obtained from Garnett et al. (1995) and amounts to 0.07 dex. The\nICF (N) value was obtained from the models by Moore et al. (2004) and amounts to 1.13\ndex for region V and to 0.91 dex for region X. Note that the ICF (N) value predicted by\nPeimbert & Costero (1969) is given by N(O)/N(O+ ) and amounts to 0.97 dex for region V\nand to 0.75 dex for region X; the ICF (N) formula by Peimbert and Costero is a very good\napproximation for H II regions with low degree of ionization but becomes only fair for H II\nregions with high degree of ionization. The ICF (N) for models in which a large fraction of\nthe ionizing photons escape from the H II region becomes even larger than those predicted\nby the models by Moore et al. (2004), see for example the results for NGC 346 obtained by\nRela\u00f1o et al. (2002).\nThe gaseous abundances for O and Ne were obtained from the following equations\n(Peimbert & Costero 1969)\nN(O+ ) + N(O++ )\nN(O)\n=\n(14)\nN(H)\nN(H+ )\nand\n\nN(Ne)\n=\nN(H)\n\n\u0012\n\nN(O+ ) + N(O++ )\nN(O++ )\n\n\u0013\n\nN(Ne++ )\n.\nN(H+ )\n\n(15)\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nThe gaseous abundances of S, Cl, and Ar, were obtained from the following equations:\n\nand\n\nN(S)\nN(S+ ) + N(S++ )\n= ICF (S)\n,\nN(H)\nN(H+ )\n\n(16)\n\nN(Cl++ )\nN(Cl)\n= ICF (Cl)\n,\nN(H)\nN(H+ )\n\n(17)\n\nN(Ar++ ) + N(Ar3+ )\nN(Ar)\n= ICF (Ar)\n.\nN(H)\nN(H+ )\n\n(18)\n\nThe ICF (S) values were estimated from the models by Garnett (1989) and amount to\n0.22 dex for region V and to 0.10 dex for region X. The ICF (Cl) values amount to 0.05\ndex for regions V and X and were obtained by averaging the observed N(Cl+ + Cl++ +\nCl+3 )/ N(Cl++ ) values obtained for Orion, 30 Doradus, and NGC 3576 (Esteban et al. 2004;\nPeimbert 2003; Garc\u0131\u0301a-Rojas et al. 2004). The ionization correction factor due to the Ar+\nfraction was estimated from ICF (Ar) = 1/[1 - O+ /O] (Liu et al. 2000) and amounts to 0.05\ndex and 0.09 dex for regions V and X respectively.\nBased on the previous considerations, we present the total gaseous abundances of regions\nV and X in Tables 7 and 8 respectively. The errors for region X are larger than those for\nregion V because the brightness of region X is about three times smaller than that of region\nV. Within the errors the abundances of both regions are similar. We need observations of\nhigher quality, than those presented in this paper, to establish the presence of abundance\nvariations among H II regions in NGC 6822.\nIn Table 9 we present the adopted total abundances for NGC 6822. To obtain the total\nO and C abundances we have to add a correction to the gaseous abundance due to the\npresence of dust. Following Esteban et al. (1998) this corrections amount to 0.08 dex for O\nand 0.10 dex for C.\nWe have also computed the hydrogen, helium, and heavy elements by mass for NGC\n6822 V and amount to: X = 0.7501, Y = 0.2433, and Z = 0.0066. The Z value was computed\nfrom the C, N, O, Ne, and Fe abundances (see Table 9, where the Fe abundance comes from\nstellar data by Venn et al. 2001) and assuming that they constitute 83.3% of the total Z\nvalue. This fraction was obtained by assuming that all the other heavy elements in NGC\n6822 present the same abundances relative to O than in the Sun as presented by Asplund\net al. (2005).\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n7.\n7.1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nComparison with other nebular abundance determinations\n\nThere have been seven O/H determinations for Hubble V carried out by Smith (1975);\nLequeux et al. (1979); Talent (1980); Peimbert & Spinrad (1970); Pagel et al. (1980); Skillman\net al. (1989) and Hidalgo-G\u00e1mez et al. (2001) that amounted to 12 + log O/H = 8.45,\n8.28, 8.20, 8.10, 8.19, 8.20 and 8.10 respectively; these determinations were made based on\nthe T (O III) temperature and under the assumption that t2 = 0.00. Statistical errors are\ntypically about 0.1 dex, so to a first approximation there is good agreement among the seven\ndeterminations. A second look reveals a systematic difference, the first three determinations\nwere made with the image intensified dissector scanner, IIDS, and yield an average value of\n8.31 dex, while the other four were made with other detectors and yield an average value of\n8.15 dex, the difference is real and is mainly due to the non-linearity of the IIDS detector\n(Peimbert & Torres-Peimbert 1987).\nIn Tables 7 and 8 we compare our determinations with those of Lequeux et al. (1979)\nand Hidalgo-G\u00e1mez et al. (2001) for t2 = 0.00. As expected our values for O/H and Ne/H\nare in better agreement with those by Hidalgo-G\u00e1mez et al. (2001). As mentioned above the\nreason is the non linearity of the IIDS detector that increases the difference between weak\nlines and strong lines, thus yielding lower temperatures and consequently larger O/H and\nNe/H values. For Region V this non linearity also yields lower He+ /H+ values , because\nthe helium line intensities are weaker than the H line intensities. For region X the He+ /H+\ndifferences are not significative because the observational errors are larger than the differences\npredicted by the non-linearity. The smaller errors for region V than for region X are due to\nthe higher luminosity of region V, as can be seen in Table 2. Due to the smaller errors in\nthe line intensities of region V, we took the abundances of this region as representatives of\nthe whole galaxy.\n\n7.2.\n\nComparison with stellar abundance determinations\n\nThe stars and H II regions of NGC 6822 have reliable O/H determinations that can be\ncompared. In Table 10 we present the O/H abundances derived in this paper for Hubble\nV with those derived by Venn et al. (2001) for two A type supergiants; the A supergiants\nwere formed a few million years ago, therefore we expect them to have the same abundances\nas the H II regions. We find excellent agreement between the stellar O/H values and the\nones found using recombination lines; alternatively, the agreement with the values derived\nusing collisionally excited lines (t2 = 0.00) is poor. Also, based on three B supergiant stars\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nin NGC 6822 Muschielok et al. (1999) find a Fe/H of -0.5 \u00b1 0.2 dex relative to the Sun in\nexcellent agreement with the results of Venn et al. (2001) for two A type supergiants.\n\n7.3.\n\nComparison with the Magellanic Clouds, the Orion nebula, and the Sun\n\nAlso in Table 9 we present the Orion and the solar abundances for comparison. For\nOrion: Fe comes from Cunha & Lambert (1994) based on Orion B stars, and all the other\nelements from Esteban et al. (2004). For the Sun: He comes from Christensen-Dalsgaard\n(1998), and all the other elements from Asplund et al. (2005), the solar abundances are the\nphotospheric ones with the exception of He that corresponds to the initial He abundance\nand of Cl that comes from meteoritic data.\nWe consider that the Orion nebula is more representative of the present chemical composition of the solar vicinity than the Sun for two main reasons: a) the Sun appears deficient\nby roughly 0.1 dex in O, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, Y, Ce, Nd and Eu, compared with its immediate\nneighbors with similar iron abundances (Allende Prieto et al. 2004), the probable reason\nfor this difference is that the Sun is somewhat older than the comparison stars; and b) all\nthe chemical evolution models of the Galaxy predict a steady increase of the O/H ratio in\nthe solar vicinity with time, for example the chemical evolution models of the solar vicinity\npresented by Carigi (2003) and Carigi et al. (2005b) indicate that the O/H value in the solar\nvicinity has increased by 0.13 dex since the Sun was formed.\nThere are two independent methods to determine the O/H ratio in the ISM of the solar\nvicinity: a) From the solar 12 + log O/H ratio by Asplund et al. (2005) that amounts to\n8.66 and taking into account the increase of the O/H ratio due to galactic chemical evolution\nsince the Sun was formed, that according to state of the art chemical evolution models of the\nGalaxy amounts to 0.13 dex (e. g. Carigi et al. 2005b), we obtain a value of 8.79 dex; b) The\nO/H value derived by Esteban et al. (2005), based on the galactic gradient determined from\nthe O II recombination lines observed in H II regions, that amounts to 8.79 dex in perfect\nagreement with the value based on the solar abundance and the chemical evolution of the\nGalaxy.\nLee et al. (2005) have derived a value of 12 + log O/H = 8.45 for the A supergiant\nWLM 15 in the Local Group dwarf irregular galaxy WLM, they have also derived a value\nof 12 + log O/H = 7.83 for two H II regions in the same galaxy based on the T (4363/5007)\ntemperature and under the assumption that t2 = 0.00. The discrepancy between these two\ndeterminations can be reduced by assuming that 20% of the oxygen atoms are trapped in\ndust grains inside H II regions, as is the case in the Orion nebula (Esteban et al. 1998),\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nand by considering the presence of spatial temperature fluctuations. A typical correction\nfor spatial temperature fluctuations based on the recombination lines of O II in NGC 6822V\nand other extragalactic H II regions (Esteban et al. 2002) amounts to about 0.25 dex.\n\n8.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe show that the ratios of the lines of multiplet 1 of O II are not constant, but instead\nthey depend on density. Only at high densities they coincide with the ratios predicted using\nLTE. The same arguments can probably be made for most recombination lines from other\nmultiplets of heavy elements.\nWe present a set of empirical equations to determine the O abundances from recombination lines of multiplet 1 of O II. These equations are useful for those cases in which not\nall the lines of the multiplet are observed.\nWe derive for the first time the C/H and O/H abundances of NGC 6822 based on\nrecombination lines. We have also derived the N, O, Ne, S, Cl, and Ar abundances based on\ncollisionally excited lines for t2 = 0.00 and for t2 > 0.00 (the t2 derived in this paper).\nThe O/H ratio derived from O II recombination lines is 0.26 dex higher than that derived\nfrom [O III] \u03bb\u03bb4363, 4959, 5007 collisionally excited lines under the assumption that t2 = 0.00\n(that is, by adopting the T (4363/5007) temperature).\nWe have found that, in NGC 6822, the O/H abundance ratio derived from O II recombination lines is in very good agreement with the O/H ratios derived from A-type supergiants,\nwhile the O/H abundances derived from collisionally excited lines are not. This result is\nqualitatively equivalent to that found for the solar vicinity by Esteban et al. (2004) and\nCarigi et al. (2005a); these authors find that the H II region O/H recombination abundances\nare in agreement with the O/H solar abundances after considering the O/H enrichment predicted by a chemical evolution model of the Galaxy, while the H II region O/H abundances\nderived from collisionally excited lines (assuming t2 = 0.00) are not.\nThe high N/O ratio places NGC 6822 on the plateau formed by irregular galaxies in\nthe N/O-O/H diagram, which implies that a large fraction of the N present in this object\nis already due to secondary production. From the O/H, C/O, and N/O values it follows\nthat NGC 6822 is considerably more chemically evolved than the SMC. Chemical evolution\nmodels for NGC 6822 are presented elsewhere (Carigi et al. 2005a).\nWe are grateful to Leticia Carigi and Pedro Col\u0131\u0301n for several useful discussions.
