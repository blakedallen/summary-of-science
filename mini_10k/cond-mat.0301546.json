This elementary excitation is absent in classical magnets, where the excitations perform a precession of the moment around its\nequilibrium position and are therefore transversaly polarized (see Fig. 1(b)). The longitudinal mode is difficult\nto observe since it occurs only in quantum spin systems\nwith reduced dimensionality. Only recently a LM has\nbeen detected by inelastic neutron scattering in quantum\nspin- 21 [2,3] and spin-1 [4,5] chain compounds.\nQuantum spin-fluctuations are of special importance\nin quasi-zero dimensional systems with weakly coupled spin clusters. These lattices allow for quantum\nphase transitions between magnetically ordered states\nand non-magnetic phases with a spin gap. The recently\ndiscovered [6] spin-tetrahedral compounds Cu2 Te2 O5 X2\n(X=Cl, Br) have been shown to order at transition tem(Cl)\n(Br)\nperatures TN = 18.2 K and TN = 11.4 K which are\nstrongly suppressed with respect to the magnitude of the\nintra-tetrahedral couplings [7]. Unconventional Ramanscattering has been found in the magnetic channel [7,8]\nand the occurrence of low-lying singlet excitations has\nbeen proposed [6]. Plateaus in the magnetization have\nbeen predicted for a related linear chain of spin tetrahedra [9].\nThe nature of the ordered states in Cu2 Te2 O5 X2 has\n(Cl)\nnot yet been settled. The ordering temperature TN and\n(Br)\nTN decreases and rises respectively with an external\nmagnetic field [7]. This unusual magnetic field-induced\n(Br)\nstabilization of TN motivated in part the present study.\nA decrease of TN is typical for an antiferromagnet in\nthe classical limit. We will show later on that TN may\nrise near a quantum-phase transition. This results then\nindicates Cu2 Te2 O5 Br2 to be close to criticality.\nHere we report the observation of a LM in\nCu2 Te2 O5 Br2 by Raman scattering in a magnetic field\nand present the evolution of this mode under the influence of an external magnetic field. We believe that\n\nWe present a comprehensive study of the coupled\ntetrahedra-compound Cu2 Te2 O5 Br2 by theory and experiments in external magnetic fields. We report the observation\nof a longitudinal magnon in Raman scattering in the ordered\nstate close to quantum criticality. We show that the excited\ntetrahedral-singlet sets the energy scale for the magnetic ordering temperature TN . This energy is determined experimentally. The ordering temperature TN has an inverse-log\ndependence on the coupling parameters near quantum criticality.\n\nPACS numbers: 75.30.Gw, 75.10.Jm, 78.30.-j\n\n1\n\n\fthis study constitutes the first time that a longitudinal magnon is detected optically as well as the first\nobservation of such a mode in a tetrahedral spin system, i.e. in a system with an even number of spins\nper unit cell. Furthermore, high-field magnetization\nand other thermodynamic data on pure and substituted\nCu2 Te2 O5 (Brx Cl1\u2212x )2 are compared via a mean-field\nanalysis which allows to determine the microscopic parameters for Cu2 Te2 O5 Br2 . We find, interestingly, that\nthe scale of the ordering temperature TN is set by the\n(non-magnetic) excited singlet of the copper tetrahedron\nand that TN has an essential singularity at criticality.\nMean-field approach.- We assume that the basic\nspin-cluster in this compound is given by the copper\ntetrahedron (see inset in Fig. (2)). We denote with skl\nthe spin-singlet state of two intra-tetrahedral sites k and l\nand with t\u03b1\nkl the respective triplet states, with \u03b1 = \u00b11, 0.\nWe start by considering the eigenstates of the isolated\ntetrahedra with Ht = J1 [(S1 + S2 ) * (S3 + S4 )] + J2 (S1 *\nS2 + S3 * S4 ), which consist of two singlets, three triplets\nand one quintuplet.\nFor J2 < J1 the ground state singlet \u03c8s1 and the excited singlet \u03c8s2 are\n\u0003\n\u22121 \u0002\n\u2212\n\u2212 +\n\u03c8s1 = \u221a t012 t034 \u2212 t+\n12 t34 \u2212 t12 t34 ,\n3\n\nwith h\u03c6\u0303|\u03c6i = 0 and new energies\n\u0015\n\u0014\nq\nJ1\n2\n2\n2\n(5)\n1 \u2213 1 + 32M Jc /(3J1 )\n\u2206E\u03c6,\u03c6\u0303 =\n2\n\u221a\nwith tan \u03c6 = \u2212\u2206E\u03c6 6/(4Jc M ). |\u03c6i is the ground-state\nand |\u03c6\u0303i can be identified as a longitudinal magnon excitation. The physical interpretation of this excitation is as\nfollows. When Jc =0 we have isolated tetrahedra and |\u03c6\u0303i\nwould correspond to the excited intra-tetrahedral triplet\n0\nstate |\u03c8t1\ni. For Jc 6= 0, |\u03c6\u0303i evolves continuously from\n\u03c8t1 as a function of the inter-tetrahedral coupling Jc and\nbecomes soft at the transition-point to the ordered state.\nThe molecular field couples also \u03c8t1 with the quintuplet\n\u03c8q , though we neglect this coupling here since we are interested in phases with low transition temperatures TN\nfor which the high-energy quintuplet does not contribute\nsignificantly.\nThe calculation of the staggered magnetization M =\nT r[(S1z + S2z \u2212 S3z \u2212 S4z )e\u2212\u03b2H ]/(4Z) (Eq. 3) leads to the\nfollowing self-consistency equation,\nr\ne\u2212\u03b2E\u03c6 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b2E\u03c6\u0303 2 tan \u03c6\nM=\n,\n(6)\nZ\n3 1 + tan2 \u03c6\n\n\u03c8s2 = s12 s34\n\nwhere \u03b2 = 1/T and Z is the partition function for the\ncoupled tetrahedra system, i.e. Z = e\u2212\u03b2Es1 +e\u2212\u03b2Es2 +... .\n(qc)\nFor Jc = Jc = 3J1 /4 the magnetization M goes to zero\nand the system shows a second-order phase transition at\nTN .\nResults.- The transition-temperature TN can be obtained from (6) by imposing M = 0. Assuming that (i)\ns2 is the lowest excited state of a tetrahedron and (ii) at\nsmall temperatures only the leading order in a 1/T expansion is contributing in Eq. (6), TN can be analytically\nderived:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(7)\nTN \u2243 \u2206Es2 log\u22121 Jc(qc) /(Jc \u2212 Jc(qc) ) ,\n\n(1)\nwith eigenenergies Es1 = \u22122J1 + J2 /2 and Es2 =\n\u22123J2 /2 = Es1 + \u2206Es2 , with \u2206Es2 = 2J1 \u2212 2J2 . The\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nthree triplets \u03c8t1\n, \u03c8t2\nand \u03c8t3\nhave the (excitation) energies \u2206Et1 = J1 , \u2206Et2 = \u2206Et3 = 2J1 \u2212J2 with respective\neigenstates\n1\n\u2212\n\u2212 +\n0\n= \u221a (t+\n\u03c8t1\n12 t34 \u2212 t12 t34 ),\n2\n1\n\u2212 0\n\u2212\n\u03c8t1\n= \u221a (t012 t\u2212\n34 \u2212 t12 t34 )\n2\n1\n+\n0\n0 +\n\u03c8t1\n= \u221a (t+\n12 t34 \u2212 t12 t34 )\n2\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n.\n\u03c8t2\n= s12 t\u03b1\n\u03c8t3\n= t\u03b1\n34 ,\n12 s34\n\n(2)\n\nThe quintuplet has the energy \u2206Eq = 3J1 . The intertetrahedra couplings can be described in a mean-field approach by [10]:\nHMF = \u2212Jc M (S1z + S2z \u2212 S3z \u2212 S4z ) ,\n\nand M =\n\n1 z\nhS\n4 1\n(3)\n\nwith M being the staggered magnetization order parameter. Jc is here the sum over all inter-tetrahedra couplings.\n0\nThe mean-field Hamiltonian HMF couples \u03c8s1 and \u03c8t1\nleading to new eigenstates for H = Ht + HMF :\n0\n|\u03c6i = cos \u03c6 |\u03c8s1 i + sin \u03c6 |\u03c8t1\ni,\n0\n|\u03c6\u0303i = sin \u03c6 |\u03c8s1 i \u2212 cos \u03c6 |\u03c8t1\ni\n\nTN shows an inverse-log singularity close to the quantum\n(qc)\n(qc)\ncritical point at Jc = Jc . The critical Jc = 3J1 /4 is\nindependent of J2 . In Fig. (2) we plot TN as a function of\nJc both as obtained in the analytic solution Eq. (7) and\nby solving numerically the self-consistent equation Eq. 6.\n(qc)\nNote that for the region Jc \u223c Jc , Eq. (7) provides a\ngood approximation for TN .\n+ S2z The\n\u2212 S3z inverse-log\n\u2212 S4z i\ndependence of the Ne\u00e9l-temperature\nimplies that TN is substantial even near the quantum\ncritical point, as illustrated in Fig. (2), in contrast to the\nmagnitude of the zero-temperature magnetic moment,\nr\n\u0010\n\u00112\n1\n(qc)\n(8)\nM (T = 0) = \u221a\n1 \u2212 Jc /Jc ,\n6\nwhich has a standard mean-field form [11] (compare Fig.\n(2)). For J2 > J1 the tetrahedral ground-state changes\n\n(4)\n2\n\n\fthe evolution of the experimentally determined specific\nheat as a function of substitution x is presented. Note\nthat the mean-field results for increasing Jc reproduce the\ncontinuous shift of the specific heat anomaly to higher\ntemperatures wit decreasing x.\nA further support to the interpretation of these systems as that of coupled tetrahedra with a mean-field Jc\ninter-tetrahedra coupling and with a TN ordering temperature, is obtained from high-field magnetization measurements which are presented in Fig. 4. We observe\na finite slope for all samples at small fields which increases with decreasing x. Extrapolating M(H) from high\nto low fields a finite crossover field, Hcross = 12 T, 5 T and\n\u2248 0 T respectively, is defined as a function of decreasing\nx. No direct evidence for a plateau in the magnetization\nis found. A plateau at M=1/2 is predicted for a 1D chain\nof spin tetrahedra with parameters placing the system in\nthe gapped phase [9], what leads us to conclude that\nthese systems cannot be described as chains of tetrahedra. The finite slope in M(H) at small fields and even for\nx=1 is intrinsic and points to the underlying weak N\u00e9el\nstate. The corresponding anisotropy is observed in single\ncrystal susceptibility shown in the inset of Fig. 4. The\ntransition is evident as a kink in \u03c7(T) with a magnetic\nfield perpendicular to the c-axis.\nRaman spectroscopy.- We have performed Raman\nscattering experiments on c-axis oriented single crystals\nwith diameters \u00d8 \u2248 0.2 mm and length l \u2248 1 mm. The\nused scattering geometry in (cc) light scattering polarizations corresponds to A symmetry [7]. The magnetic\nfield has been applied perpendicular to the light scattering polarization. In Fig. (5) we present Raman data\nfor Cu2 Te2 O5 Br2 in magnetic fields up to 6 T. We observe a shift of the low-energy magnetic mode at \u03bdlong =\n16.3 cm\u22121 = 23.4 K (for B = 0) to higher energies as a\nfunction of B and the appearance of an additional, magnetic field-induced mode at \u03bdsing = 23.2 cm\u22121 = 33.2 K\n(B 6= 0). In the inset Fig. (5a) the low energy spectrum\nis displayed with smaller optical slit width and higher\nspectral resolution. The intensity of the higher energy\nmode increases with field. It is not observable for B = 0.\nIn Fig. (5b) the energies of the respective modes are\nshown as a function of the magnetic field. While the\nhigher energy mode does not show an appreciable magnetic field dependence (upper open symbols), the lower\nenergy mode shows a nonlinear dependence on the magnetic field (lower full and open symbols). The full line\nin Fig. (5b) is a fit to the data proportional to the\nsquare of the magnetic field. The dashed curve describing the higher energy mode is proportional to the weaker,\npositive field dependence of the transition temperature\nas determined by specific heat and magnetic susceptibility measurements [7]. In the following we shall argue that these two modes at \u03bdlong = 16.3 cm\u22121 and at\n\u03bdsing = 23.2 cm\u22121 can be identified as a longitudinal\nmagnon mode and as an excitation to the second singlet\n\nto \u03c8s2 and the non-magnetic singlet \u03c8s2 sets therefore\nthe scale for TN .\nStates in an external field.- An external longitudinal magnetic field does not induce additional couplings\nin between the different eigenstates but it leads to shifts\nin the respective eigenenergies. A transversal magnetic\nfield Bx induces, on the other hand, a coupling in be\u00b1\n0\ntween \u03c8t1\nand \u03c8t1\n(see Eq. (2)). The mean-field ground\nstate, which breaks rotational invariance, can be written,\nin lowest order in Bx , as\ni\nsin \u03b1 h +\n\u2212\ni + |\u03c8t1\ni ,\n(9)\n|\u03c6, Bx i = cos \u03b1 |\u03c6i + \u221a |\u03c8t1\n2\nwith tan \u03b1 = Bx sin \u03c6/(J1 \u2212 \u2206E\u03c6 ). In lowest order in\nBx , the ground-state energy, \u2206E\u03c6,Bx = E\u03c6,Bx \u2212 E\u03c6 ,\n\u2206E\u03c6,Bx = \u2212Bx2 sin2 \u03c6/(J1 \u2212 \u2206E\u03c6 ),\n\n(10)\n\ndecreases quadratically with Bx .\nThis result has an interesting consequence for the transition temperature. The energy of the excited singlet Es2\nis not affected by Bx , its relative energy to the ground\nstate \u2206Es2 increases consequently with Bx (compare Eq.\n(10)). Eq. (7) tells us then that the N\u00e9el temperature\nalso increases with Bx [13]. An order-of magnitude estimate of the effect for Cu2 Te2 O5 Br2 and Bx = 13 T yields\n\u2206TN \u2248 0.8 K = 0.56 cm\u22121 which agrees well with the experimentally observed raise of \u223c 1 K reported already in\nRef. [7].\nFor the longitudinal magnon, a calculation analogous\nto Eq. (10) leads to\n\u2206E\u03c6\u0303,Bx = \u2212Bx2 cos2 \u03c6/(J1 \u2212 \u2206E\u03c6\u0303 ),\n\n(11)\n\nThe resulting change \u2206E\u03c6\u0303,Bx = E\u03c6\u0303,Bx \u2212 E\u03c6\u0303 in the\nlongitudinal-magnon energy is positive, as J1 \u2212 \u2206E\u03c6\u0303 <\n0, and substantially larger than the shift for the\nground-state \u2206E\u03c6,Bx (and correpondingly for Es2 ) since\ncos2 \u03c6 \u226b sin2 \u03c6. As we shall discuss in the next sections,\nthis trend is qualitatively in agreement with the Raman\ndata presented below.\nSubstitution experiments.- Specific heat and\nhigh-field magnetization have been measured on\nCu2 Te2 O5 (Brx Cl1\u2212x )2 powder samples with x =\n1, 0.75, 0.66 and 0.0 [6,7]. Substituting Br by Cl leads\nto a continuous decrease of the unit cell volume by 7%\n(x=0) and an increase of the transition temperature from\n11.4 to 18.2 K. Also other physical properties change continuously with substitution [12]. In our coupled-cluster\nmodel we expect that the decrease of the unit cell volume\nis described by an increase of the coupling constant Jc .\nWe have calculated the specific heat\nCv = \u03b2 2 h(H \u2212 hHi)2 i\n\n(12)\n\nin the mean-field approximation. In Fig. 3 the results\nare shown for various Jc values. In the inset of Fig. 3\n3\n\n\f(qc)\n\nFor Cu2 Te2 O5 Br2 we have Jc = 0.85J1 ((Jc /Jc )2 =\n0.78) and \u2206long \u2248 0.47\u2206max. The energy scale \u2206max\noccuring in Eq. (14) is set by the longitudinal magnongap in the classical N\u00e9el ordered state, i.e. in the limit of\nstrong inter-dimer (tetrahedra) couplings, where it has\nthe value \u2206max \u2192 Jc . With Jc \u2248 0.85J1 and J1 \u2248 47 K\nwe then find for Cu2 Te2 O5 Br2 that \u2206long \u2248 19 K, which\nis qualitatively in agreement with the experimental value\n(exp)\n\u2206long = \u03bdlong = 23.4 K, see the inset Fig. 5 b. Due\nto the renormalization of \u2206long by the fluctuations near\nthe quantum-critical point, see Eq. (14), we cannot easily quantitatively estimate its dependence on an external\nmagnetic field, as presented in inset b) of Fig. 5.\nComparison with Cu2 Te2 O5 Cl2 .- The magnitude of\nthe intra-tetrahedral parameters have been estimated [6]\nfrom susceptibility measurements to be similar both for\nCu2 Te2 O5 Br2 and the isostructural Cu2 Te2 O5 Cl2 . The\n(Cl)\nsubstantially enhanced N\u00e9el temperature [7] of TN =\n18.2 K indicates a larger inter-dimer coupling for the Clcompound. This notion is consistent with the Ramanresults for doped compounds which indicates a harding\nof the excitations with Cl-content, as predicted by Eq.\n(14) [12]. We did not attempt a quantitative analysis of the coupling parameters for Cu2 Te2 O5 Cl2 since\nwe were not able to observe the second singlet as in\nCu2 Te2 O5 Br2 . Indeed, a generalized tight-binding analysis of band-structure calculations [18] indicates that the\nratio of the intra-dimer couplings J2 /J1 in Cu2 Te2 O5 Cl2\nis smaller than in Cu2 Te2 O5 Br2 . These findings also suggest that for Cu2 Te2 O5 Cl2 the excited singlet with energy Es2 = 2J1 \u2212 2J2 should probably be located in the\nenergy-range of the magnetic continuum and thus not\nobservable separately.\nConclusions.- We have presented a comprehensive set of theory and experimental data indicating that the isostructural spin-tetrahedral compounds\nCu2 Te2 O5 (Brx Cl1\u2212x )2 constitute a series of systems with\na systematic variation of the microscopic parameters with\nrespect to a quantum critical transition. We have pointed\nout the importance of the low-lying singlet for the magnetic state and reported the observation of a low-energy\nlongitudinal magnon.\nWe acknowledge the support of the German Science\nFoundation (DFG SP1073, SFB484), and important discussions with Wolfram Brenig, Frederic Mila, Jens Jensen\nand T. Saha-Dasgupta.\n\n\u03c8s2 in Eq. (1) respectively.\nExcited singlet.- We interpret the additional higher\nenergy mode at \u03bdsing = 23.2 cm\u22121 presented in Fig. (5)\nas a transition to the second singlet \u03c8s2 = s12 s34 . Since\nthis system is noncentrosymmetric, there is a nonzero\nDzyaloshinski-Moriya (DM) [14] interaction. Assuming a\n(DM)\n\u223c\nDM contribution to the Raman operator, i.e. HR\nDij * (Si \u00d7 Sj ) we find a non-zero Raman matrix-element\n(DM)\n\nh\u03c8s2 |HR\n\n|\u03c6, B x i \u223c sin \u03b1 \u223c B x M .\n\nThe 23.2 cm\u22121 -mode would therefore be observable only\nin the ordered phase and in an external magnetic field,\nconsistent with experiment. Having identified this mode\nwith the transition to \u03c8s2 we have then that\n\u2206Es2 = 2J1 \u2212 2J2 = \u03bdsing \u223c 33 K .\n\n(13)\n\nConsidering (13) and the magnetic susceptibility [6,7]\nfor T > TN we find a good fit with J1 \u223c 47 K and\nJ2 \u223c 31 K which yields J2 /J1 \u223c 0.66. The experi(Br)\nmental transition temperature [7] of TN = 11.4 K for\nCu2 Te2 O5 Br2 implies via the self-consistency condition\n(6) that Jc \u223c 0.85J1 .\nMoreover, recalling Eqs. (7) and (10), for Bx = 6 T\nthe energy \u2206Es2 of the excited singlet shifts by about\n0.12 cm\u22121 . This increase is too small to be resolved by\nRaman, although the data presented in inset b) of Fig. 5\nseem to indicate a small increase.\nLongitudinal magnon.- We observe that the meanfield Hamiltonian (3) leads to a Q = 0 ordering for\nJc > 0 and the soft longitudinal magnon |\u03c6\u0303i should be\ndirectly observable with Raman. For Jc < 0 ordering\nwith Q = \u03c0 would occur and additional backfolding to\nthe zone-center via residual lattice distortions would be\nnecessary. The matrix-element h\u03c6\u0303|HR |\u03c6i of the Ramanoperator HR \u223c Si * Sj (i, j = 1, . . . , 4) is \u223c cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6. It\nvanishes in the decoupled-tetrahedra limit Jc = 0, \u03c6 = 0\nand the transition should be observable only in the ordered phase.\nSummarizing, the Raman mode at \u03bdlong =16.3 cm\u22121 =\n23.4 K in Fig. 5 (i) has been shown [7] to become soft at\nthe ordering temperature, (ii) it is observable only in the\ncondensed phase and its energy increases quadratically\n(compare Eq. (11)) with the field. We interpret it therefore as a longitudinal magnon.\nThe energy of this mode is strongly suppressed below\nits mean-field energy E\u03c6\u0303 \u2212 E\u03c6 = 54 K by dispersion. We\ncan estimate the magnitude of this suppression by comparison with the results of a bond-operator-theory for a\ncoupled dimer system [15,16] (alternatively one may use\na generalized RPA-approach [17]). The effective dimer\u03b1\nstates are (\u03c8s1 , \u03c8t1\n).
