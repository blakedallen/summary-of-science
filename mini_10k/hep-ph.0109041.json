These processes test the SM directly on the quantum level and,\nthus, are particularly sensitive to new physics (for a recent review see [1]). While the\ndirect production of new (supersymmetric) particles is reserved for the planned hadronic\nmachines such as the LHC at CERN, the indirect search of the B factories already implies\nsignificant restrictions for the parameter space of supersymmetric models and will thus\nlead to important clues for the direct search of supersymmetric particles. It is even\npossible that these rare processes lead to the first evidence of new physics by a significant\ndeviation from the SM prediction, for example in the observables concerning direct CP\nviolation, although it will then be difficult to identify in this way the new structures in\ndetail. But also in the long run, after new physics has already been discovered, these\ndecays will play an important role in analyzing in greater detail the underlying new\ndynamics.\nOne of the main difficulties in examining the observables in B physics is the influence of the strong interaction. As is well known, for matrix elements dominated by\nlong-distance strong interactions there is no adequate quantitative solution available in\nquantum field theory. The resulting hadronic uncertainties restrict the opportunities in B\nphysics significantly. If new physics does not show up in B physics through large deviations as recent experimental data indicates the focus on theoretically clean variables like\ninclusive radiative B decays is mandatory.\nDirect CP Violation In Radiative B Decays\n\n1\n\n\fWithin inclusive decays like B \u2192 Xs/d \u03b3 the long-distance strong interactions are less\nimportant and well under control due to the heavy mass expansion. The decay B \u2192 Xs \u03b3\nwas first observed by the CLEO collaboration [2]; these measurements have been refined\n[3, 4] and confirmed by other experiments [5, 6] (see also [7]). The present world average\nusing the present data from BELLE, CLEO and ALEPH is\n\nB (B \u2192 Xs\u03b3) = (3.22 \u00b1 0.40) \u00d7 10\u22124.\n\n(1)\n\nThe theoretical prediction of the Standard Model (SM) up to next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) precision for the total decay rate of the B \u2192 Xs \u03b3 mode [8] is well in\nagreement with the experimental data. The theoretical NLL prediction for the B \u2192 Xs \u03b3\nbranching ratio [12] leads to\n\nB (B \u2192 Xs\u03b3) = (3.32 \u00b1 0.14 \u00b1 0.26) \u00d7 10\u22124,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the first error represents the uncertainty regarding the scale dependences, while\nthe second error is the uncertainty due to the input parameters. In the second error the\nuncertainty due to the parameter mc /mb is dominant.\nThis inclusive mode already allows for theoretically clean and rather strong constraints on the parameter space of various extensions of the SM [9, 10, 11]. While many\nphenomenolgical analyses of the inclusive B \u2192 Xs/d \u03b3 decays in supersymmetry are retricted to the assumption of minimal flavour violation including only CKM induced\nflavour change, a model-independent analysis also has to consider the generic new supersymmetric sources of flavour change due to the mixing in the squark mass matrix.\nIn [11] new model-independent bounds on supersymmetric flavour-violating parameters\nwere derived from B \u2192 Xs \u03b3. The importance of interference effects for the bounds on\nthe parameters in the squark mass matrices within the unconstrained MSSM is explicitly demonstrated. In former analyses no correlations between the different sources of\nflavour violation were taken into account [10]. The new bounds are in general one order\nof magnitude weaker than the original bounds on the single off-diagonal element, which\nwas derived in previous work [10] by neglecting any kind of interference effects.\nRecently, quark mass effects within the decay B \u2192 Xs\u03b3 were further analysed [13],\nin particular the definitions of the quark masses mc and mb . The charm quark enters in\nspecific NLL matrix elements (see Fig. 1) where the charm quark mass is dominantly\noff-shell. Therefore, the authors of [13] argue that the running charm mass should be\nchosen instead of the pole mass. The latter choice was used in all previous analyses\n[14, 8, 15, 16, 12].\npole\n\nmpole\nc /mb\n\n\u21d2\n\npole\n\nmMS\nc (\u03bc)/mb , \u03bc \u2208 [mc , mb ].\n\n(3)\n\nSince these matrix elements start at NLL order only and, thus, the renormalization\nscheme for mc and mb is an NNLL issue, one should regard this choice as an educated\nguess of the NNLL corrections. The new choice is guided by the experience gained\nfrom many higher-order calculations in perturbation theory. Numerically, the shift from\npole\npole\npole\n= 0.22 \u00b1 0.04 is rather important and leads\nmc /mb = 0.29 \u00b1 0.02 to mMS\nc (\u03bc)/mb\nto a +11% shift of the central value of the B \u2192 Xs \u03b3 branching ratio.

In particular, detailed measurements of CP asymmetries in rare B decays will be possible in the near future. Theoretical predictions for\nthe normalized CP asymmetries of the inclusive channels (see [18, 19, 20]) within the\nSM lead to\n\u0393(B\u0304 \u2192 Xs/d \u03b3) \u2212 \u0393(B \u2192 Xs\u0304/d \u0304\u03b3)\n\u03b1CP (B \u2192 Xs/d \u03b3) =\n(5)\n\u0393(B\u0304 \u2192 Xs/d \u03b3) + \u0393(B \u2192 Xs\u0304/d \u0304\u03b3)\n\u03b1CP (B \u2192 Xs\u03b3) \u2248 0.6%,\n\n\u03b1CP (B \u2192 Bd \u03b3) \u2248 \u221216%\n\n(6)\n\nwhen the best-fit values for the CKM parameters [21] are used. An analysis for the\nleptonic counterparts is presented in [22]. The normalized CP asymmetries may also\nbe calculated for exclusive decays; however, these results are model-dependent. An\nexample of such a calculation may be found in [23].\nCLEO has already presented a measurement of the CP asymmetry in inclusive b \u2192 s\u03b3\ndecays, yielding [24]\n\u03b1CP (B \u2192 Xs\u03b3) = (\u22120.079 \u00b1 0.108 \u00b1 0.022) \u00d7 (1.0 \u00b1 0.030) ,\nDirect CP Violation In Radiative B Decays\n\n(7)\n3\n\n\fwhich indicates that very large effects are already excluded.\nSupersymmetric predictions for the CP asymmetries in B \u2192 Xs/d \u03b3 depend strongly on\nwhat is assumed for the supersymmetry-breaking sector and are, thus, a rather modeldependent issue. The minimal supergravity model cannot account for large CP asymmetries beyond 2% because of the constraints coming from the electron and neutron electric\ndipole moments [25]. However, more general models allow for larger asymmetries, of\nthe order of 10% or even larger [26, 19]. Recent studies of the B \u2192 Xd \u03b3 rate asymmetry\nin specific models led to asymmetries between \u221240% and +40% [28] or \u221245% and\n+21% [27]. In general, CP asymmetries may lead to clean evidence for new physics by\na significant deviation from the SM prediction.\nIn [29] it was explicitly derived, that a bound on the combined asymmetries within\nthe decays b \u2192 s\u03b3 and b \u2192 d\u03b3, as well as their leptonic counterparts is possible which\nis more suitable for the experimental settings. It provides a stringent test, if the CKM\nmatrix is indeed the only source of CP violation. Using U-spin, which is the SU (2)\nsubgroup of flavour SU (3) relating the s and the d quark and which is already a wellknown tool in the context of nonleptonic decays [30, 31], one derives relations between\nthe CP asymmetries of the exclusive channels B\u2212 \u2192 K \u2217\u2212 \u03b3 and B\u2212 \u2192 \u03c1\u2212 \u03b3 and of the\ninclusive channels B \u2192 Xs \u03b3 and B \u2192 Xd \u03b3. One should make use of the U-spin symmetry\nonly with respect to the strong interactions. Moreover, within exclusive final states, the\nvector mesons like the U-spin doublet (K \u2217\u2212 , \u03c1\u2212 ) are favoured as final states because\nthese have masses much larger than the (current-quark) masses of any of the light quarks.\nThus one expects, for the ground-state vector mesons, the U-spin symmetry to be quite\naccurate in spite of the nondegeneracy of md and ms . Defining the rate asymmetries (not\nthe normalized CP asymmetries) by\n\u2206\u0393(B\u2212 \u2192 V \u2212 \u03b3) = \u0393(B\u2212 \u2192 V \u2212 \u03b3) \u2212 \u0393(B+ \u2192 V + \u03b3)\n\n(8)\n\none arrives at the following relation [29]:\n\u2206\u0393(B\u2212 \u2192 K \u2217\u2212 \u03b3) + \u2206\u0393(B\u2212 \u2192 \u03c1\u2212 \u03b3) = bexc \u2206exc\n\n(9)\n\nwhere the right-hand side is written as a product of a relative U-spin breaking bexc and\na typical size \u2206exc of the CP violating rate difference. In order to give an estimate of the\nright-hand side, one can use the model result from [23] for \u2206exc ,\n\u2206exc = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22127 \u0393B .\n\n(10)\n\nThe relative breaking bexc of U-spin can be estimated, e.g. from spectroscopy. This leads\nus to\nMK \u2217 \u2212 m \u03c1\n= 14%.\n(11)\n| bexc |= 1\n\u2217\n2 (MK + m\u03c1 )\nCertainly, other estimates are also possible, such as a comparison of f\u03c1 and fK \u2217 . In this\ncase one finds a very small U-spin breaking. Using the more conservative value for\nbexc , which is also compatible with sum rule calculations of form factors (see [32]), one\narrives at the standard-model prediction for the difference of branching ratios\n| \u2206B (B\u2212 \u2192 K \u2217\u2212 \u03b3) + \u2206B (B\u2212 \u2192 \u03c1\u2212 \u03b3) |\u223c 4 \u00d7 10\u22128\nDirect CP Violation In Radiative B Decays\n\n(12)\n4\n\n\fNote that the right-hand side is model-dependent.\nQuite recently, the U-spin breaking effects were also estimated in the QCD factorization approach [33]. Within this approach, it was shown that the U-spin breaking effect\nessentially scales with the differences of the two form factors, (FK \u2217 \u2212 F\u03c1 ). Using the\nformfactors from the QCD sum rule calculation in [34] and maximizing the CP asymmetries by a specific choice of the CKM angle \u03b3, the authors of [33] obtain\n\u2206B (B\u2212 \u2192 K \u2217\u2212 \u03b3) + \u2206B (B\u2212 \u2192 \u03c1\u2212 \u03b3) \u223c \u22123 \u00d7 10\u22127 ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhile for the separate asymmetries they obtain:\n\u2206B (B \u2192 K \u2217 \u03b3) = \u22127 \u00d7 10\u22127 ,\n\n\u2206B (B \u2192 \u03c1\u03b3) = 4 \u00d7 10\u22127 .\n\n(14)\n\nThis calculation explicitly shows the limitations of the relation (9) as a SM test.\nThe issue is much more attractive in the inclusive modes. Due to the 1/mb expansion\nfor the inclusive process, the leading contribution is the free b-quark decay. In particular,\nthere is no sensitivity to the spectator quark and thus one arrives at the following relation\nfor the CP rate asymmetries [29]:\n\u2206\u0393(B \u2192 Xs\u03b3) + \u2206\u0393(B \u2192 Xd \u03b3) = binc \u2206inc .\n\n(15)\n\nIn this framework one relies on parton-hadron duality; so one can actually compute\nthe breaking of U-spin by keeping a nonvanishing strange quark mass. The typical size\nof binc can be roughly estimated to be of the order of | binc |\u223c m2s /m2b \u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 ; | \u2206inc |\nis again the average of the moduli of the two CP rate asymmetries. These have been\ncalculated (for vanishing strange quark mass), e.g. in [18] and thus one arrives at\n| \u2206B (B \u2192 Xs\u03b3) + \u2206B (B \u2192 Xd \u03b3) |\u223c 1 \u00d7 10\u22129 .\n\n(16)\n\nAny measured value in significant deviation of (16) would be an indication of new\nsources of CP violation. Although only an estimate is given here, it should again be\nstressed that in the inclusive mode the right-hand side in (16) can be computed in a\nmodel-independent way with the help of the heavy mass expansion.\nGoing beyond leading order in the 1/mb expansion the first subleading corrections\nare of order 1/m2b only. The 1/m2b corrections are induced by the imaginary part of the\nforward scattering amplitude T (q):\nT (q) = i\n\nZ\n\nd 4 x < B | T O7+ (x) O7 (0) | B > exp(iqx) .\n\n(17)\n\nwhere only the magnetic operator O7 is taken into account. Using the operator product\nexpansion for T O7+ (x) O7 (0) and heavy quark effective theory methods, the decay width\n\u0393(B \u2192 Xs \u03b3) reads [38, 39] (modulo higher terms in the 1/mb expansion):\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b1G2F m5b\n\u03b4NP\n(O7 ,O7 )\n2 2\n\u0393B\u2192Xs \u03b3 =\n| VtbVts | C7 (mb ) 1 + 2\n,\n32\u03c04\nmb\n9\n1\n\u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb2 ,\n(18)\n\u03b4NP =\n2\n2\nDirect CP Violation In Radiative B Decays\n\n5\n\n\fFIGURE 2. a) Feynman diagram from which the operator \u00d5 arises. b) Relevant cut-diagram for the\n(O2 , O7 )-interference.\n\nwhere \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 are the parameters for kinetic energy and the chromomagnetic energy.\nUsing \u03bb1 = \u22120.5 GeV2 and \u03bb2 = 0.12 GeV2 , one gets \u03b4NP \u2243 \u22124%. Thus, the contributions are small and cancel in the sum of the rate asymmetries - in the limit of U-spin\nsymmetry. The U-spin breaking effects in this contribution also induce an overall factor\nm2s /m2b in addition - as one can read off from the explicit results for the B \u2192 Xs l + l \u2212 case\n[35].\nThere are also nonperturbative corrections which scale with 1/m2c [36]. which are\ninduced by the interference of the mangnetic O7 and the four-quark operator O2 . This\neffect is generated by the diagram in Fig. 2a (and by the one, not shown, where the gluon\nand the photon are interchanged); g is a soft gluon interacting with the charm quarks in\nthe loop. Up to a characteristic Lorentz structure, this loop is given by the integral\nZ 1\n0\n\ndx\n\nZ 1\u2212x\n\ndy\n\n0\n\nxy\nm2c \u2212 kg2 x(1 \u2212 x) \u2212 2xykg k\u03b3\n\n.\n\n(19)\n\nAs the gluon is soft, i.e. kg2 , kg k\u03b3 \u2248 \u039bQCD mb /2 \u226a m2c , the integral can be expanded in kg .\nThe (formally) leading operator, denoted by \u00d5 , is\nG\n\n\u00d5 = \u221aF VcbVcs\u2217 C2\n2\n\neQc\ns\u0304\u03b3\u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )gs G\u03bd\u03bb b \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 \u2202\u03bb F\u03c1\u03c3\n48\u03c02 m2c\n\n.\n\n(20)\n\nThen working out the cut diagram shown in Fig. 2b, one obtains the nonperturbative\n(\u00d5 ,O )\ncontribution \u0393B\u2192X7s \u03b3 to the decay width, which is due to the (O2 , O7 ) interference.\nNormalizing this contribution by the LL partonic width, one obtains\n(\u00d5 ,O )\n\n\u0393B\u2192X7s \u03b3\n\u0393LL\nb\u2192s\u03b3\n\n=\u2212\n\n1 C2 \u03bb2\n\u2243 +0.03 .\n9 C7 m2c\n\n(21)\n\nThis result corresponds to the leading term in an expansion in the parameter\nt = kg k\u03b3 /2m2c . The expansion parameter is approximately mb \u039bQCD /2m2c \u2248 0.3 (rather\nthan \u039b2QCD /m2c ) and it is not a priori clear whether formally higher order terms in the mc\nexpansion are numerically suppressed. However, the explicit expansion of the complete\nvertex function, corresponding to Fig. 2a, shows that higher order terms are indeed\nsuppressed, because the corresponding coefficients are small (see i.e. [37]).\nDirect CP Violation In Radiative B Decays\n\n6\n\n\fMoreover, the operator \u00d5 does not contain any information on the strange mass, thus,\nalso in these contributions one finds the same overall suppression factor from the U-spin\nbreaking.\nThe corresponding long-distance contributions from up-quark loops are CKM suppressed in the B \u2192 Xs\u03b3 case, but this does not hold in the B \u2192 Xd \u03b3 case. Naively,\none could expect that the corresponding contributions from up-quark loops scale with\n1/m2u . However, following the approach of [37], one easily shows that the general vertex function cannot be expanded in the parameter t in that case. However, the expansion in inverse powers of t is reasonable. The leading term in this expansion scales like\nt \u22121 \u223c m2u /kg k\u03b3 and therefore cancels the factor 1/m2u in the prefactor (see the analogous\n1/m2c factor in (20)) and one gets a suppression factor (\u039b2QCD /m2u )*(m2u /kg k\u03b3 ) [37]. Thus,\nalthough the expansion in inverse powers in t induces nonlocal operators, one explicitly\nfinds that the leading term scales with \u039bQCD /mb 1 .\nThis argument improves the discussion in [29] where the argument was given that\nvector dominance calculations in [40] show that the long-distance contributions from the\nup-quark loops to the decay rates are found to be rather small. However, that argument\nin [29] does not allow any statement about the effects of the U-spin breaking in constrast\nto the one given here.\nSumming up, the analysis shows that the known nonperturbative contributions to (16)\nare under control and small and that this prediction provides a clean SM test, if generic\nnew CP phases are present or not. Any significant deviation from the estimate (16) would\nbe a strong hint to non-CKM contributions to CP violation.\nFinally, we emphasize that an analogous prediction for the leptonic inclusive B \u2192\nXs/d \u03b3 modes is also possible taking into account some specific cuts on the invariant\ndilepton spectrum.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe are grateful to Gerhard Buchalla for discussions and to Gino Isidori for a careful\nreading of the manuscript.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n\nT.
