Observations and theoretical work suggest that globular clusters may be born with initially very large binary fractions. We present\nfirst results from our newly modified Monte-Carlo cluster evolution code,\nwhich treats binary interactions exactly via direct N -body integration.\nIt is shown that binary scattering interactions generate significantly less\nenergy than predicted by the recipes that have been used in the past to\nmodel them in approximate cluster evolution methods. The new result\nthat the cores of globular clusters in the long-lived binary-burning phase\nare smaller than previously predicted weakens the agreement with observations, thus implying that more than simply stellar dynamics is at work\nin shaping the globular clusters we observe today.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nObservations, in combination with theoretical work, suggest that although the\ncurrently observed binary fractions in the cores of globular clusters may be small\n(\u223c 10%), the initial cluster binary fraction may have been significantly larger\n(\u223c 100%) (Ivanova et al., 2005). It has been understood theoretically for many\nyears that primordial binaries in star clusters act as an energy source (through\nsuper-elastic scattering encounters with stars and other binaries), with a binary\nfraction of a few percent being enough to postpone deep core collapse for many\nrelaxation times (see Fregeau et al., 2003, for discussion and references). In\naddition to playing a large part in the global evolution of globular clusters, dynamical interactions of binaries also strongly affect the formation and evolution\nof stellar and binary exotica (e.g. low-mass X-ray binaries, blue stragglers).\nIn previous studies using approximate methods like Monte-Carlo or FokkerPlanck to simulate the evolution of star clusters, binary interactions had generally been treated using recipes culled from the results of large numbers of\nnumerical scattering experiments-although in one case direct integration of binary interactions was performed for equal-mass stars (Giersz & Spurzem, 2003).\nThe recipes are typically known only for equal-mass binary interactions, thus\nprohibiting the use of a mass function in the cluster's initial conditions. In order to model realistic clusters, which contain a wide range of masses, one must\nnumerically integrate each binary interaction in order to resolve it properly.\nIn this article we present first results from our newly modified Monte-Carlo\ncode, in which we have included for the first time exact integration of dynamical\ninteractions of binaries with arbitrary mass members.

In this model all stars had the same mass. This can be\ncompared directly with Fig. 3 of Fregeau et al. (2003), in which we used recipes\nfor binary interactions. The evolution of the two models is quite similar, with\nboth showing the binaries starting to get kicked out of the core (as evidenced\nby rh,b ) around t/trh \u2248 17, entering deep core collapse at t/trh \u223c 25, showing\nroughly the same rate of binary mass loss (due to binaries getting disrupted or\nkicked out of the cluster), and roughly the same rate of energy generation in binary interactions. However, we find that although the simple recipes reproduce\nthe energy generation in binary\u2013single interactions reasonably well, they over-\n\n\fEbb, Ebs [|Ec(0)|]\n\nMb/Mb(0), M/M(0)\n\nStar Cluster Evolution with Primordial Binaries\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n\nrc, rh,b, rh,s [rNB]\n\n0\n10\n1\n0.1\n0.01\n\n0\n\n10\n\n5\nt [FP units]\n\nFigure 2.\n\nEbb, Ebs [|Ec(0)|]\n\nMb/Mb(0), M/M(0)\n\nSame as Fig. 1, but for an initial binary fraction of 10%.\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n\nrc, rh,b, rh,s [rNB]\n\n0\n1\n0.1\n0.01\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nt [FP units]\n\nFigure 3.\n\nSame as Fig. 1, but for a tidally-truncated W0 = 7 King model\nwith an initial binary fraction of 20%.\n\n3\n\n\f4\n\nFregeau, et al.\n\nestimate the rate of energy generation in binary\u2013binary interactions by a factor\nof two relative to exact integrations. The same disagreement between recipes\nand exact integrations for binary\u2013binary interactions was found by Giersz &\nSpurzem (2003) in their models. Another point of note is that with direct integrations the approach to deep core collapse is much noisier, with what appear\nto be many \"mini\" gravothermal oscillations.\nFig. 2 shows the same as Fig. 1, but for an initial binary fraction of 10%.\nThis can be compared directly with Fig. 4 of Fregeau et al. (2003). Again we find\nthat the energy generation rate due to binary\u2013single interactions is comparable\nbetween recipes and direct integrations. For binary\u2013binary, integrations predict\na rate that is roughly 60% of what recipes predict.\nFinally, in Fig. 3 we show the evolution of an initial W0 = 7 King model with\n20% primordial binaries, which can be compared directly with Fig. 11 of Fregeau\net al. (2003). Just as in that paper, the cluster is disrupted by the tidal field of\nits host galaxy before core collapse, at a time of roughly t/trh \u223c 35\u201340. Looking\nmore closely at the figures, we see that the evolution of Mb , M , rh,s , and rh,b is\nquite similar between the two models. Again, we find that with integrations the\nbinary-burning rate is smaller. One major difference between the two is that\nwith integrations the core radius shrinks, then remains at a constant value once\nthe steady binary-burning phase is reached. With recipes, the core appears to\nexpand from the start. The discrepancy is no doubt caused by the larger rate\nof binary-burning in the model with recipes.\n3.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough our models for evolving globular clusters are somewhat simplified-\nsince they include the effects of two-body relaxation and binary interactions,\nbut ignore the effects of stellar evolution-we can still reach some conclusions by\ncomparing with observations. In Fregeau et al. (2003) we found that the values of\ncluster half-mass radius to core radius, rh /rc , predicted by models using recipes\nfor binary interactions were in reasonably good agreement with observations.\nOur new models, which treat binary interactions exactly, predict a significantly\nlower core energy generation rate, and a consequently smaller core, yielding\nvalues of rh /rc up to an order of magnitude larger. This disagreement suggests\nthat processes other than simply stellar dynamics-such as stellar evolution-\nmay play a very important role in shaping the clusters we observe today.\nAcknowledgments.
