Introduction\nString theory is expected to be invariant under a very large set of discrete symmetries (\"dualities\"), associated with arithmetic subgroups of a\nvariety of reductive Lie groups. For example, maximally supersymmetric string theory (type II superstring theory), compactified on a d-torus\nto D = 10 \u2212 d space-time dimensions, is strongly conjectured to be invariant\nunder Ed+1 (Z), the integral points of the rank d + 1 split real form1 of one\nof the groups in the sequence E8 , E7 , E6 , Spin(5, 5), SL(5), SL(3) \u00d7 SL(2),\nSL(2) \u00d7 R+ , SL(2) listed in table 1.2\n1The split real forms are conventionally denoted E\nn(n) , but in this paper we will truncate this to En except when other forms of En are needed.\n2 Unfortunately the literature contains some disagreement over precisely which groups\nEd+1 (R) occur here, an ambiguity amongst the split real groups having the same Lie algebra. For example some authors have SO(5, 5, R) instead of its double cover Spin(5, 5, R);\nin general possible groups are related by taking quotients by a subgroup G0 of the center\nof the larger group. The choices listed here, which represent the current consensus, are\neach the real points of an (algebraically) simply connected Chevalley group. (The real\n\n\fSMALL REPRESENTATIONS, STRING INSTANTONS, AND FOURIER MODES\n\n3\n\n\u03b12\n\n***\n\n\u03b11\n\n\u03b13\n\n\u03b1d+1\n\n\u03b14\n\nFigure 1. The Dynkin diagram for the rank d+1 Lie group\nEd+1 , which defines the symmetry group for D = 10 \u2212 d.\nThese symmetries severely constrain the dependence of string scattering\namplitudes on the symmetric space coordinates (or \"moduli\"), \u03c6d+1 , which\nparameterise the coset Ed+1 /Kd+1 , where the stabiliser Kd+1 is the maximal compact subgroup of Ed+1 . The list of these symmetry3 groups and\nstabilisers is given in table 1. These moduli are scalar fields that are interpreted as coupling constants in string theory. A general consequence of\nthe dualities is that scattering amplitudes are functions of \u03c6d+1 that must\ntransform as automorphic functions under the appropriate duality group\nEd+1 (Z). It is difficult to determine the precise restrictions these dualities\nimpose on general amplitudes, but certain exact properties have been obtained in the case of the four-graviton interactions, where a considerable\namount of information has been obtained for the first three terms in the low\nenergy (or \"derivative\") expansion of the four graviton scattering amplitude\nin [1] (and references cited therein). These are described by terms in the\neffective action of the form\n(D)\n\nE(0,0) (\u03c6d+1 ) R4 ,\n\n(D)\n\nE(1,0) (\u03c6d+1 ) \u2202 4 R4 ,\n\n(D)\n\nand E(0,1) (\u03c6d+1 ) \u2202 6 R4 ,\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere the symbol R4 indicates a contraction of four powers of the Riemann\n(D)\ntensor with a standard rank 16 tensor. The coefficient functions, E(p,q) (\u03c6d+1 ),\nare automorphic functions that are the main focus of our interests (the\nnotation is taken from [1, 2] and will be reviewed later in (2.3)). More\nprecisely we will focus on the three terms shown in (1.1) that are protected\nby supersymmetry, which accounts for the relatively simple form of their\ncoefficients.\ngroups Ed+1 (R) and Kd+1 are not topologically simply connected, except in the trivial\nD = 10A case.)\nAlthough we will try to be precise in our definitions, this discrepancy does not affect\nthe results in this paper. We note, in particular, that Ed+1 (Z) is mathematically defined\nas the stabilizer of the Chevalley lattice in the Lie algebra ed+1 under the adjoint action.\nSince the center acts trivially under the adjoint action, the integral points of the larger\ngroup factors as the direct product of G0 with the integral points of the smaller group. In\nparticular the Eisenstein series for the two groups are the same (see for example (2.13)).\n3The continuous groups, E\nd+1 (R), will be referred to as symmetry groups while the\ndiscrete arithmetic subgroups, Ed+1 (Z), will be referred to as duality groups.\n\n\f4\n\nM.B.

The symmetry groups of maximal supergravity\nin D = 10 \u2212 d \u2264 10 dimensions. The group Ed+1 (R) is a split\nreal form of rank d + 1, and Kd+1 is its maximal compact\nsubgroup. In string theory these groups are broken to the\ndiscrete subgroups, Ed+1 (Z), as indicated in the last column\n(see [3] and its updated version in [4]). The split real form\nEd+1 (R) is determined among possible covers or quotients by\nits maximal compact subgroup Kd+1 , which shares the same\nfundamental group. The terminology 10A and 10B in the\nfirst column refers to the two possible superstring theories\n(types IIA and IIB) in D = 10 dimensions.\n\nThe coefficients of the first two terms satisfy Laplace eigenvalue equations\n(2.6-2.7) and are subject to specific boundary conditions that are required\nfor consistency with string perturbation theory and M-theory. The solutions\nto these equations are particular maximal parabolic Eisenstein series that\nwere studied in [2] (for cases with rank \u2264 5) and [1] (for the E6 , E7 and\nE8 cases), and will be reviewed in the next section. The required boundary\nconditions in each limit amount to conditions on the constant terms in the\nexpansion of these series in three limits associated with particular maximal4 parabolic subgroups of relevance to the string theory analysis. Such\nsubgroups have the form P\u03b1 = L\u03b1 U\u03b1 , where \u03b1 labels a simple root, U\u03b1 is\nthe unipotent radical and L\u03b1 = GL(1) \u00d7 M\u03b1 is the Levi factor.5 The three\nsubgroups of relevance here have Levi factors L\u03b11 = GL(1) \u00d7 Spin(d, d),\nL\u03b12 = GL(1) \u00d7 SL(d + 1), and L\u03b1d+1 = GL(1) \u00d7 Ed , respectively. In each\ncase the GL(1) parameter, r, can be thought of as measuring the distance\nto the cusp6, as will be discussed in the next section. A key feature of the\nboundary conditions is that they require these constant terms to have very\n4The D = 8 case is degenerate and also involves non-maximal parabolics (see table 1).\n5For clarity, we emphasize that its usage here indicates that every element of L can\n\u03b1\n\nbe written as an element of GL(1) times an element of M\u03b1 (and not that L\u03b1 is the direct\nproduct of the two factors, which is a stronger statement).\n6Each of the groups we are considering has a single cusp. The various limits correspond\nto different ways of approaching this cusp.\n\n\fSMALL REPRESENTATIONS, STRING INSTANTONS, AND FOURIER MODES\n\n5\n\nfew components with distinct powers of the parameter r.

This\ngeneralizes results for the SL(2, Z) case (relevant to the ten-dimensional type\n(10\u2212d)\n(10\u2212d)\nIIB string theory). The functions E(0,0) and E(1,0) in the intermediate\nrank cases involve linear combinations of Eisenstein series [2], which will be\n(10\u2212d)\ndiscussed later in section 4. The third coefficient function, E(0,1) satisfies\nan interesting inhomogeneous Laplace equation and is not an Eisenstein\nseries [1, 6]. Its constant terms in the three limits under consideration were\nalso analysed in the earlier references but it will not be considered in this\npaper, which is entirely concerned with Eisenstein series.\nIn other words, our previous work showed that the particular Eisenstein\nseries in (1.2) and (1.3) have strikingly sparse constant terms as required to\ncorrectly describe the coefficients of the 21 -BPS and 14 -BPS interactions. But\nthe string theory boundary conditions also determine the support of the nonzero Fourier coefficients in each of the three limits under consideration. In\nstring theory, the non-zero Fourier modes describe instanton contributions\nto the amplitude. These are classified in BPS orbits obtained by acting on a\nrepresentative instanton configuration with the appropriate Levi subgroup.\nA given instanton configuration generally depends on only a subset of the\nparameters of the Levi group, L\u03b1 = GL(1) \u00d7 M\u03b1 , so that a given orbit\ndepends on the subset of the moduli that live in a coset space of the form\nM\u03b1 /H (i) , where H (i) \u2282 M\u03b1 denotes the stabiliser of the i-th orbit. The\ndimension of the i-th orbit is the dimension of this coset space.\nIn particular, the coefficients in the s = 3/2 cases covered by (1.2) must be\nlocalized within the smallest possible non-trivial orbits (\"minimal orbits\")\nof the Levi actions, as required by the 21 -BPS condition. Furthermore, in\nthe s = 5/2 cases covered by (1.3) the coefficients are shown to be localized within the \"next-to-minimal\" (NTM) orbits (see section 2.2). The role\nof next-to-minmal orbits was also considered in [7]. However, the specific\nsuggestion there was based on the next-to-minimal representations of Gross\nand Wallach [8, 9], who did not consider the split groups of relevance to the\n7In [1, 2, 5] the series were indexed by the label [1 0 * * * 0] of the root \u03b1 .

Overview of scattering amplitudes and Eisenstein series\nSince this paper covers topics of interest in both string theory and mathematics, this section will present a brief description of the background to\nthese topics from both points of view followed by a detailed outline of the\nrest of the paper.\n2.1. String theory Background. We are concerned with exact (i.e., nonperturbative) properties of the low energy expansion of the four-graviton\nscattering amplitude in dimension D = 10 \u2212 d, which is a function of the\nmoduli, \u03c6d+1 , as well as of the particle momenta kr (r = 1, . . . , 4) that are\nP\nnull Lorentz D-vectors (kr2 = kr * kr = 0) which are conserved ( 4r=1 kr =\n0). They arise in the invariant combinations (Mandelstam invariants), s =\n\u2212(k1 + k2 )2 , t = \u2212(k1 + k4 )2 and u = \u2212(k1 + k3 )2 that satisfy s + t + u = 0.\nAt low orders in the low-energy expansion the amplitude can usefully be\nseparated into analytic and nonanalytic parts\nAD (s, t, u) = Aanalytic\n(s, t, u) + Anonanalytic\n(s, t, u)\nD\nD\n\n(2.1)\n\n(where the dependence on \u03c6d+1 has been suppressed).

Since s, t, u are quadratic in momenta the successive\nterms in the expansion are of order n = 2p + 3q in powers of (momenta)2 .\nThe degeneracy, dn = b(n + 2)/2c \u2212 b(n + 2)/3c, of terms with power n is\ngiven by the generating function9,\n\u221e\nX\n1\n=\ndn xn ,\n(2.4)\n(1 \u2212 x2 )(1 \u2212 x3 )\nn=0\n\nso d0 = 1, d1 = 0 and dn = 1 for 2 \u2264 n \u2264 5.\n(D)\nThe coefficient functions in (2.3), E(p,q) (\u03c6d+1 ), are automorphic functions\n\nof the moduli \u03c6d+1 appropriate to compactification on Td . The first term on\nthe right-hand side of (2.3) is identified with the tree-level contribution of\n(D)\nclassical supergravity and has a constant coefficient given by E(0,\u22121) (\u03c6d+1 ) =\n3. The terms of higher order in s, t, u represent stringy modifications\nof supergravity, which depend on the moduli in a manner consistent with\nduality invariance. This expansion is presented in the Einstein frame so\nthe curvature, R, is invariant under Ed+1 (Z) transformations, whereas it\ntransforms nontrivially in the string frame since it is nonconstant in \u03c6d+1 \u2208\nEd+1 (R)/Kd+1 .\nApart from the first term, the power series expansion in (2.3) translates\ninto a sum of local interactions in the effective action. The first two of these\nhave the form\nZ\nZ\np\np\n(D)\n(D)\n12\u2212D\n8\u2212D\n4\nD\n(D)\ndD x \u2212G(D) E(1,0) \u2202 4 R4 .

In particular, the R4 interaction breaks 16 of the 32\n8The Einstein frame is the frame in which lengths are measured in Planck units rather\n\nthan string units, and is useful for discussing dualities.\n9This is the same as the well-known dimension formula for the space of weight 2n\nholomorphic modular forms for SL(2, Z), which are expressed as polynomials in the (holomorphic) Eisenstein series G4 and G6 .\n\n\f8\n\nM.B.

The next interaction is\n(D)\n\nthe p = 2, q = 0 term in (2.3), E(2,0) \u2202 8 R4 . Naively this interaction breaks all\nsupersymmetries, in which case it is expected to be much more complicated,\nbut it would be of interest to discover if supersymmetry does constrain this\ninteraction.10\nIt was argued in [2], based on consistency under various dualities, that\n(D)\n(D)\n(D)\nthe coefficients E(0,0) , E(1,0) and E(0,1) satisfy the equations\n\u0013\n\u0012\n3(11 \u2212 D)(D \u2212 8)\n(D)\n(D)\nE(0,0) = 6 \u03c0 \u03b4D,8 ,\n(2.6)\n\u2206\n\u2212\nD\u22122\n\u0012\n\u0013\n5(12 \u2212 D)(D \u2212 7)\n(D)\n(D)\n\u2206\n\u2212\nE(1,0) = 40 \u03b6(2) \u03b4D,7 ,\n(2.7)\nD\u22122\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0010\n\u0011\n6(14 \u2212 D)(D \u2212 6)\n(D)\n(D) 2\n(D)\n\u2206\n\u2212\nE(0,1) = \u2212 E(0,0) + 120\u03b6(3)\u03b4D,6 , (2.8)\nD\u22122\nwhere \u2206(D) is the Laplace operator on the symmetric space E11\u2212D /K11\u2212D .\nThe discrete Kronecker \u03b4 contributions on the right-hand-side of these equations arise from anomalous behaviour and can be related to the logarithmic\nultraviolet divergences of loop amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric supergravity [5].\nRecall that automorphic forms for SL(2, Z) have Fourier expansions (i.e.,\nq-expansions) in their cusp. For higher rank groups, automorphic forms have\nFourier expansions coming from any one of several maximal parabolic subgroups P\u03b1r , where the simple root \u03b1r corresponds to node r in the Dynkin\ndiagram for Ed+1 in figure 1. We are particularly interested in this Fourier\nexpansion for r = 1, 2, or d + 1, because each of these expansions has a distinct string theory interpretation in terms of the contributions of instantons\nin the limit in which a special combination of moduli degenerate. These\nthree limits are:\n(i) The decompactification limit in which one circular dimension, rd ,\nbecomes large. In this case the amplitude reduces to the D + 1dimensional case with D = 10 \u2212 d. The BPS instantons of the\nD = (10 \u2212 d)-dimensional theory are classified by orbits of the Levi\nsubgroup GL(1) \u00d7 Ed . Apart from one exception, these instantons\ncan be described in terms of the wrapping of the world-lines of black\nhole states in the decompactified D + 1-dimensional theory around\nthe large circular dimension (the exception will be described later).\nThis limit is associated with the parabolic subgroup P\u03b1d+1 .\n10A discussion of the properties of E (9) in nine dimensions can be found in [12, sec(2,0)\n\ntion 4.1.1].\n\n\fSMALL REPRESENTATIONS, STRING INSTANTONS, AND FOURIER MODES\n\n9\n\n(ii) The string perturbation theory limit of small string coupling constant,\n\u221a\nin which the string coupling constant, yD , is small, and string\nperturbation theory amplitudes are reproduced. The instantons are\nexponentially suppressed contributions that are classified by orbits\nof the Levi subgroup GL(1) \u00d7 Spin(d, d). This limit is associated\nwith the parabolic subgroup P\u03b11 .\n(iii) The M -theory limit in which the M -theory torus has large volume\nVd+1 , and the semi-classical approximation to eleven-dimensional supergravity is valid. This involves the compactification of M-theory\nfrom 11 dimensions on the (d + 1)-dimensional M -theory torus,\nwhere the instantons are classified by orbits of the Levi subgroup\nGL(1) \u00d7 SL(d + 1). This limit is associated with the parabolic subgroup P\u03b12 .\nThe special features of the constant terms that lead to consistency of all\nperturbative properties in these three limits appear to be highly nontrivial,\nand indicate particularly special mathematical properties of the Eisenstein\nseries that define the coefficients of the R4 and \u2202 4 R4 interactions. The\nsolutions to equations (2.6-2.8) satisfying requisite boundary conditions on\nthe constant terms (zero modes) in the Fourier expansions in the limits (i),\n(ii), and (iii) were obtained for 7 \u2264 D \u2264 10 in [2], and for 3 \u2264 D \u2264 6 in [1].\nIn particular, (1.2) and (1.3) were found to be solutions for the cases with\n(D)\nduality groups E6 , E7 and E8 . Whereas the coefficient functions E(0,0) and\n(D)\n\nE(1,0) are given in terms of Eisenstein series that satisfy Laplace eigenvalue\n(D)\n\nequations on the moduli space, the coefficient E(0,1) , of the 81 -BPS interaction\n\u2202 6 R4 , is an automorphic function that satisfies an inhomogeneous Laplace\nequation. Various properties of its constant terms in these three limits were\nalso determined in [1, 2].\nWhereas the earlier work concerned the zero Fourier modes of the coefficient functions, in this paper we are concerned with the non-zero modes\nin the Fourier expansion in any of the three limits listed above. These\nFourier coefficients should have the exponentially suppressed form that is\ncharacteristic of instanton contributions. In more precise terms, the angular variables involved in the Fourier expansion with respect to a maximal\nparabolic subgroup P\u03b1 come from the abelianization11 U\u03b1 /[U\u03b1 , U\u03b1 ] of the\nunipotent radical U\u03b1 of P\u03b1 , and are conjugate to integers that define the\ninstanton \"charge lattice\". Asymptotically close to a cusp a given Fourier\ncoefficient is expected to have an exponential factor of exp (\u2212S (p) ), where\nS (p) is the action for an instanton of a given charge, as will be defined in\nsection 3.1. In the case of fractional BPS instantons the leading asymptotic\nbehaviour in the cusp is the real part of S (p) , and is related to the charge\n(B.4), which enters the phase of the mode.\n11See (4.3).\n\n\f10\n\nM.B. GREEN, S.D. MILLER, AND P. VANHOVE\n\nIn each limit the 12 -BPS orbits are minimal orbits (i.e., smallest nontrivial orbits) while the 41 -BPS orbits are \"next-to-minimal\" (NTM) orbits (i.e.,\nsmallest nonminimal or nontrivial orbits). The next largest are 18 -BPS orbits, which only arise for groups of sufficiently high rank; in the E8 case\nthere is a further 18 -BPS orbit beyond that. These come up again as \"character variety orbits\", a major consideration in sections 5 and 6. They are\nclosely related to \u2013 but not to be confused with \u2013 the minimal and next-tominimal coadjoint nilpotent orbits that are attached to the Eisenstein series\n(D)\n(D)\nthat arise in the solutions for the coefficients, E(0,0) and E(1,0) in (1.2) and\n(1.3), respectively.\nNote on conventions. Following [1, Section 2.4], the parameter associated with the GL(1) factor that parameterises the approach to any cusp\nwill be called r and is normalised in a mathematically convenient manner.\nIt translates into distinct physical parameters in each of the three limits\ndescribed above, that correspond to parabolic subgroups defined at nodes\nd + 1, 1 and 2, respectively, of the Dynkin diagram in figure 1. These are\nsummarised as follows:\nLimit (ii)\n\nr2 = rd /`11\u2212d , rd = radius of decompactifying circle ,\n\u221a\nr\u22122 = yD = string coupling constant ,\n\nLimit (iii)\n\nr\n\nLimit (i)\n\n2(1+d)\n3\n\n= Vd+1 /`d+1\n11 , Vd+1 = vol. of M \u2212 theory torus .\n(2.9)\n\nThe D-dimensional string coupling constant is defined by yD = gs2 `ds /Vd ,\nwhere D = 10 \u2212 d and gs is either the D = 10 IIA string coupling constant,\ngA , or the IIB string coupling constant, gB , and Vd is the volume of Td in\nstring units.12 The Planck length scales in different dimensions are related\nto each other and to the string scale, `s , by\n8\n2\n(`A\n= `8s gA\n,\n10 )\n\n1\n\n8\n8 2\n(`B\n`11 = gA3 `s ,\n10 ) = `s gB ,\n1\n(`D )D\u22122 = `sD\u22122 yD = (`D+1 )D\u22121 , for D \u2264 8 (d \u2265 2)\nrd\n1\n8\n8 1\n`79 = `7s y9 = (`A\n= (`B\n.\n(2.10)\n10 )\n10 )\nrA\nrB\n(note the two distinct Planck lengths in the ten-dimensional case and the\ndistinction between r1 = rA and r1 = rB in the two type II theories).\n\n2.2. Mathematics background. Let us begin by recalling some notions\nfrom the theory of automorphic forms that are relevant to the expansion\n(2.3), specifically from [1, Section 2]. Let G denote the split real Lie group\nEn , n \u2264 8, defined in table 1. For convenience we fix (as we may) a Chevalley\nbasis of the Lie algebra g of G, and a choice of positive roots \u03a6+ for its root\n12We will use the symbol Td to denote the string theory d-torus while using the symbol\n\nT\n\nd+1\n\nfor the corresponding M-theory (d + 1)-torus expressed in eleven-dimensional units.\n\n\fSMALL REPRESENTATIONS, STRING INSTANTONS, AND FOURIER MODES\n\n11\n\nsystem \u03a6. Letting \u03a3 \u2282 \u03a6+ denote the positive simple roots, the Lie algebra\ng has the triangular decomposition\ng = n \u2295 a \u2295 n\u2212 ,\n\n(2.11)\n\nwhere n (respectively, n\u2212 ) is spanned by the Chevalley basis root vectors\nX\u03b1 for \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6+ (respectively, \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6\u2212 ), and a is spanned by their commutators H\u03b1 = [X\u03b1 , X\u2212\u03b1 ]. Let N \u2282 G be the exponential of n; it is a maximal\nunipotent subgroup. Likewise A = exp(a) is a maximal torus, and is isomorphic to rank(G) copies of R+ . The group G has an Iwasawa decomposition\nG = N AK, where K = Kn is the maximal compact subgroup of G listed in\ntable 1. There thus exists a logarithm map H : A \u2192 a which is inverse to\nthe exponential, and which extends to all g \u2208 G via its value on the A-factor\nof the Iwasawa decomposition of g. The integral points G(Z) are defined as\nall elements \u03b3 \u2208 G such that the adjoint action Ad(\u03b3) on g preserves the\nintegral span of the Chevalley basis.\nThe standard maximal parabolic subgroups of G are in bijective correspondence with the positive simple roots of G. Given such a root \u03b2 and\na standard maximal parabolic P\u03b2 , the maximal parabolic Eisenstein series\ninduced from the constant function on P\u03b2 is defined by the sum\nX\nG\n:=\ne2 s \u03c9\u03b2 (H(\u03b3g)) , Re s \u001d 0 ,\n(2.12)\nE\u03b2;s\n\u03b3 \u2208 (P\u03b2 \u2229G(Z))\\G(Z)\n\nwhere \u03c9\u03b2 , the fundamental weight associated to \u03b2, is defined by the condition h\u03c9\u03b2 , \u03b1i = \u03b4\u03b1,\u03b2 . These series generalize the classical nonholomorphic\nEisenstein series (the case of G = SL(2)), and more generally the Epstein\nZeta functions (the case of G = SL(n) and \u03b2 either the first or last node\nof the An\u22121 Dynkin diagram). Because of this special case, we often refer\nto the \u03b2 = \u03b11 series (in the numbering of figure 1) as the Epstein series\nfor a particular group, even if it is not SL(n). These series are the main\nmathematical objects of this paper.\nAs we remarked in footnote 2 changing G to another Chevalley group\nwith Lie algebra g changes G(Z) by a central subgroup, and so Eisenstein\nseries for the cover descend to the corresponding Eisenstein series on the\nquotient. For example,\nSpin(d,d)\n\nE\u03b2;s\n\nSO(d,d)\n\n(g) = E\u03b2;s\n\n(\u03c0(g)) ,\n\n(2.13)\n\nwhere \u03c0 : Spin(d, d, R) \u2192 SO(d, d, R) is the covering map. We shall someDd\ntimes refer to either as E\u03b2;s\nwhen we wish to emphasize that a particular\nSpin(d,d)\n\nSO(d,d)\n\nstatement applies to both E\u03b2;s\nand E\u03b2;s\n.\nAs shorthand, we often denote a root by its \"root label\", that is, stringing\ntogether its coefficients when written as a linear combination of the positive\nsimple roots \u03a3. Thus \u03b12 + \u03b13 + 2\u03b14 + \u03b15 could be denoted 0112100 * * * or\n[0112100 * * * ], with brackets sometimes added for clarity. Note that Eisenstein series of the type (2.12) are parameterized by a single complex variable,\n\n\f12\n\nM.B. GREEN, S.D. MILLER, AND P. VANHOVE\n\ns, whereas the more general minimal parabolic series in (5.3) has rank(G)\ncomplex parameters.\nThe series (2.12) is initially absolutely convergent for Re s large, and\nhas a meromorphic continuation to the entire complex plane as part of a\nmore general analytic continuation of Eisenstein series due to Langlands.\nIts special value at s = 0 is the constant function identically equal to one.\nThis corresponds to the trivial representation of G(R), and clearly has no\nnontrivial Fourier coefficients. The main mathematical content of this paper\nextends this phenomenon to other special values of s which are connected\nto small representations of real groups (see sections 2.2.2 and 5), and which\nhave very few nontrivial Fourier coefficients. This will be demonstrated to\nbe in complete agreement with a number of string theoretic predictions, in\nparticular the one stated at the end of section 1.\n(D)\nThe main results of [1] were the identifications (1.2) and (1.3) of E(0,0) and\n(D)\n\nE(1,0) , respectively, in terms of special values of the Epstein series, for 3 \u2264\n(D)\n\nD = 10\u2212d \u2264 5. The more general automorphic function E(0,1) which satisfies\n(2.8) was also analysed in [1], but will not be relevant in this paper. The case\nof Spin(5, 5) was also covered in [1], but is somewhat more intricate; it will\nbe explained separately. We will show in a precise sense that these Epstein\nseries at the special values at s = 0, 3/2, and 5/2 correspond, respectively,\nto the three smallest types of representations of G (see theorem 2.14) below.\n2.2.1. Coadjoint nilpotent orbits. Let g be the Lie algebra of a matrix Lie\ngroup G, whether over R or C. An element of g is nilpotent if it is nilpotent as a matrix, i.e., some power of it is zero. The group G acts on its\nLie algebra g by the adjoint action Ad(g)X = gXg \u22121 , and hence dually\non linear functionals \u03bb : g \u2192 C through the coadjoint action given by\n(Coad(g)\u03bb)(X) = \u03bb(Ad(g \u22121 )X) = \u03bb(g \u22121 Xg). Actually g is isomorphic to\nits space of linear functionals via the Killing form, and so the coadjoint action is equivalent to the adjoint action. Following common usage, we thus\nrefer to the orbits of the adjoint action of G on g as coadjoint nilpotent\norbits (even though they are, technically speaking, adjoint orbits).\nThe book [13] is a standard reference for the general theory of coadjoint\nnilpotent orbits. When G is a real or complex semisimple Lie group there are\na finite number of orbits, each of which is even dimensional. The smallest of\nthese is the trivial orbit, {0}. On the other hand, there is always an open,\ndense orbit, usually referred to as the principal or regular orbit. Another\norbit which will be important for us is the minimal orbit, the smallest orbit\naside from the trivial orbit.

Automorphic representations. The right translates of an automorphic\nfunction by the group G span a vector space on which G acts. For a suitable\nbasis of square-integrable automorphic forms and most Eisenstein series, this\n\n\f14\n\nM.B. GREEN, S.D. MILLER, AND P. VANHOVE\n\naction furnishes an irreducible representation. As we discussed in [1, Section 2], the Eisenstein series are specializations of the larger \"minimal parabolic Eisenstein series\" defined in (5.3). The automorphic representations\nconnected to the latter are generically principal series representations, an\nidentification which can be made by comparing the infinitesimal characters\n(that is, the action of all G-invariant differential operators). However, at\nspecial points the principal series reduces, and the Eisenstein series is part\nof a smaller representation.\nAn irreducible representation is related to coadjoint nilpotent orbits through\nits wavefront set, also known as the \"associated variety\" of its \"annihilator\nideal\". It is a theorem of Joseph [14] and Borho-Brylinski [15] that this set\nis always the closure of a unique coadjoint nilpotent orbit. Thus a coadjoint\nnilpotent orbit is attached to every irreducible representation of G.\n\n(Larger orbits)\nNTM Orbit\n\nE\u03b1G1 ;5/2\n\nMinimal orbit\n\nE\u03b1G1 ;3/2\n\nTrivial Orbit\n\nE\u03b1G1 ;0\n\nFigure 2.

Theorem 2.14 will\nbe used in proving theorem 6.1, which is the mathematical proof of the\nstatement concerning vanishing Fourier modes at the end of section 1 that\nwas motivated by string considerations.\n\n2.3. Outline of paper. This paper combines information deduced from\nstring theory with results in number theory involving properties of Eisenstein series, which we hope will be of interest to both string theorists and\nnumber theorists. In particular, each subject is used to make nontrivial\nstatements about the other. Sections 3\u20134 and appendices B\u2013D are framed\nin string theory language and provide information concerning the structure\nexpected of the non-zero Fourier modes based on instanton contributions in\nsuperstring theory and supergravity. The subsequent sections provide the\nmathematical foundations of these observations and generalize them significantly.\nSection 3 presents the classification of the expected orbits of fractional\nBPS instantons in the three limits (i), (ii), and (iii) considered in section 2.1,\nfrom the point of view of string theory. The BPS constraints imply that\nthese instantons span particular small orbits generated by the action of the\nLevi subgroup acting on the unipotent radical associated with the parabolic\nsubgroup appropriate to a given limit. These orbits can be thus thought of\nas character variety orbits, which are discussed at the beginning of section\n4.\nIn the rest of section 4 and appendix H we will consider explicit low-rank\nexamples (with rank d + 1 \u2264 5) of the Fourier expansions of the functions\n(10\u2212d)\n(10\u2212d)\nE(0,0) and E(1,0) in the parabolic subgroups corresponding to each limit.\nIn the cases with d + 1 \u2264 4 (D \u2265 7), the definition (2.12) implies that the\ncoefficient functions are combinations of SL(n) Eisenstein series that can\neasily be expressed in terms of elementary lattice sums. In these cases it\nis straightforward to use standard Poisson summation techniques to exhibit\nthe precise form of their Fourier modes. In particular, the non-zero Fourier\n(10\u2212d)\nmodes of E(0,0) will be determined in the three limits under consideration\nfor the rank d + 1 \u2264 4 cases. These modes are localized within the minimal\ncharacter variety orbits that contain precisely the 21 -BPS instantons that are\nanticipated in section 3. We will see, in particular, that in the decompactification limit (i) the precise form for each of these coefficients matches in\n\n\f16\n\nM.B. GREEN, S.D. MILLER, AND P. VANHOVE\n\ndetail with the expression determined directly from a quantum mechanical\ntreatment of D-particle world-lines wrapped around an S 1 \u2282 Td .13\nExplicit examples of Fourier expansions of the coefficients of the 14 -BPS\n(D)\n\ninteractions, E(1,0) , will also be presented in section 4 and appendix H. In the\nD = 10B case (with symmetry group SL(2)) this function is simply equal to\nSL(2)\n\u03b6(5) E\u03b11 ;5/2 , and the extension to D = 9 and D = 8 is also straightforward.\nBut in the D = 7 case (with symmetry group E4 = SL(5)) the coefficient\n(7)\nfunction E(1,0) is a sum of the regularized Epstein series \u00ca\u03b1E14;5/2 and the\n\nnon-Epstein Eisenstein series \u00ca\u03b1E44;5/2 (coming from the third node of the\nDynkin diagram). The analysis of the Fourier modes of E\u03b1E44;s involves the\nuse of several lattice summation identities that are proved in appendices E,\nF and G. In particular we will derive an expression for the non-Epstein\nEisenstein series coming from either the second or second-to-last nodes as\na Mellin transform of a certain lattice sum that is closely related to the\nSpin(d,d)\nSpin(d, d) Epstein Eisenstein series, E\u03b11 ;s\u2212d/2 . In appendix G we will derive a theta lift between SL(d) and Spin(d, d) Eisenstein series. This relation\nwas presented in a less rigorous form in [2]. The resulting Fourier expansions contain instanton contributions localized within the minimal ( 21 -BPS)\ncharacter variety orbit and the next-to-minimal ( 41 -BPS) character variety\norbit, comprising precisely the instantons anticipated in section 3.\n(6)\nSpin(5,5)\nThe coefficient E(0,0) is proportional to the series E\u03b11 ;3/2 , which we\nwill analyse by using the integral representation proved in proposition G.1.\nAs expected, its non-zero Fourier modes are supported within the minimal\n( 21 -BPS) character variety orbits in any of the three limits. On the other\n(6)\n\nhand the 14 -BPS coefficient, E(1,0) , involves the sum of the regularized values\nSpin(5,5)\n\nSpin(5,5)\n\nof \u00ca\u03b11 ;5/2\nand \u00ca\u03b15 ;3\n. Although we have not computed the Fourier\nexpansion of the second series, it is still possible to show that the non-zero\nFourier coefficients of this sum are supported within the minimal and nextto-minimal (i.e., 21 - and 14 -BPS) character variety orbits in each of the three\nlimits. This will be discussed at the end of section 4.\nSections 5, 6, and 7 are primarily concerned with the exceptional group\ncases, which correspond to d \u2265 5 and D \u2264 5. Since classical lattice summation techniques are difficult to apply in this context, we instead use results\nfrom representation theory to show a large number of the Fourier coefficients\nvanish. Indeed, avoiding explicit computations here is one of the main novelties of the paper. Section 5 discusses aspects connected to representation\ntheory and contains a proof of theorem (2.13), which makes important use of\nappendix A by Ciubotaru and Trapa on special unipotent representations.\n\n13The term D-particle refers to any point-like BPS particle state obtained by com-\n\npletely wrapping the spatial directions of Dp-brane states.\n\n\fSMALL REPRESENTATIONS, STRING INSTANTONS, AND FOURIER MODES\n\n17\n\nSection 6 then applies these results to Fourier expansions, using a detailed\nanalysis of character variety orbits. We will see that the spectrum of instantons that are expected to vanish on the basis of string theory is precisely\nreproduced by the Eisenstein series in (1.2) and (1.3). For the s = 3/2\ncase (the 21 -BPS case) we will reproduce the statements in [10, 17, 18] that\nonly the minimal orbit and the trivial orbit contribute to the Fourier expansions of the Eisenstein series. The relevance of this work to 21 -BPS states\nwas suggested by [7, 19]. In addition, we will find that this generalizes for\ns = 5/2 (the 41 -BPS case) to the statement that no orbits larger than the\nnext-to-minimal (NTM) orbit can contribute. The analysis in [1] showed\nthe striking fact that the particular Eisenstein series in (1.2) and (1.3) have\nconstant terms with very few powers of r (defined in 2.9) in their expansion around any of the three limits under consideration. The analysis in\nthis paper demonstrates analogous special features of the orbit structure of\nthe non-zero modes. Theorem 6.1 gives a precise statement about which\nFourier modes automatically vanish because of representation theoretic reasons. This set of vanishing coefficients is exactly those that are argued to\nvanish for string theory reasons in section 3.\nIt is important to point out that our methods show the vanishing of a precise set of Fourier coefficients, but typically do not show the nonvanishing of\nthe remaining Fourier coefficients. However, this is accomplished in a number of low rank cases by explicit calculations in section 4 and appendix H,\nand we hope to treat some of the higher rank cases in the future. Section 7\ndiscusses square-integrability of the coefficients and conditions under which\n(D)\n(D)\nE(0,0) and E(1,0) are square-integrable for higher rank groups.\n3. Orbits of supersymmetric instantons\nFrom the string theory point of view our main interest is in the systematics of orbits of BPS instantons that enter the Fourier expansions of the\ncoefficients of the low order terms in the low energy expansion of the four\ngraviton amplitude. Before describing these orbits in sections 3.3 \u2013 3.5 we\nbegin with a short overview of the special features of such instantons that\nfollow from supersymmetry. A short summary of the M-theory supersymmetry algebra and BPS particle states is given in appendix B (although\nthis barely skims the surface of a huge subject), where the structure of\nthe eleven-dimensional superalgebra is seen to imply the presence of an extended two-brane (the M 2-brane) and five-brane (the M 5-brane) in eleven\ndimensions. Compactification on a torus also leads to Kaluza\u2013Klein (KK)\npoint-like states and Kaluza\u2013Klein monopoles (KKM ), one of which is interpreted in string theory as a D6-brane. All the particle states in lower\ndimensions can be obtained by wrapping the spatial directions of these objects around cycles of the torus.\n3.1. BPS instantons. One class of BPS instantons can be described from\nthe eleven-dimensional semi-classical M-theory point of view by wrapping\n\n\f18\n\nM.B. GREEN, S.D. MILLER, AND P. VANHOVE\n\neuclidean world-volumes of M 2- and M 5- branes around compact directions\nso that the brane actions are finite. These branes couple to the three-form\nM-theory potential and its dual, and the BPS conditions constrain their\ncharges, Q(p) , to be proportional to their tensions, T (p) , where p = 2 or 5 (as\nbriefly reviewed in appendix B). Wrapping the world-volume of a euclidean\nM 2-brane around a 3-torus, T 3 \u2282 T d+1 , or a euclidean M 5-brane around a\n6-torus, T 6 \u2282 T d+1 , gives a 21 -BPS instanton, which has a euclidean action\nof the form S (p) = 2\u03c0 (T (p) + iQ(p) ). This gives a factor in amplitude of the\n(p)\nform e\u2212S that has a characteristic phase determined by the charge of the\nbrane.\nIn addition, the \"KK instanton\" is identified with the euclidean world-line\nof a KK charge winding around a circular dimension. The magnetic version\nof this is the \"KKM instanton\", one manifestation of which appears in\nstring theory as a wrapped euclidean D6-brane. Recall that a KK monopole\nin eleven dimensional (super)gravity with one compactified direction labelled\nx# has a metric of the form [20]\nds2 = V \u22121 (dx# + A * dy)2 + V dy * dy \u2212 dt2 + dx26 ,\n\nV = 1+\n\nR\n, (3.1)\n2|y|\n\nwhere ds27 = \u2212dt2 + dx26 is the seven-dimensional Minkowski metric and the\nother four dimensions, x# , y = (y1 , y2 , y3 ), define a Taub\u2013NUT space, and\nP\n|y|2 = 3i=1 yi2 . The coordinate x# is periodic with period 2\u03c0R and the\npotential, A, satisfies the equation \u2207 \u00d7 A = \u2212\u2207V = B. Poincar\u00e9 duality\nin the ten dimensions (t, x6 , y) relates the 1-form potential, A, to a 7-form,\ni.e, \u2217dA = dC (7) . If x# is identified with the M-theory circle, C (7) couples\nto a D6-brane in the string theory limit. This gives an instanton when\nits world-volume is wrapped around a 7-torus. More generally, x# can be\nidentified with other circular dimensions of the torus T d+1 , giving a further d\ndistinct KKM 's, each one of which appears as a finite action instanton when\nwrapped on an M-theory 8-torus, T 8 (i.e., when d = 7). When describing\nthese in the string theory parameterisation (on the string torus T7 ) these\nwill be referred to as \"stringy KKM instantons\". Furthermore, it is well\nunderstood how to combine wrapped branes to make 21 \u2212, 41 \u2212 and 18 -BPS\ninstantons [21, 22]14 in a manner analogous to combining p-branes to make\nstates preserving a fraction of the symmetry.\nThis description of instantons is directly relevant to the discussion of the\nsemi-classical M-theory limit (case (iii)) associated with the Fourier expansion in the parabolic subgroup P\u03b12 in section 3.5. This is the large-volume\nlimit in which eleven-dimensional supergravity is a valid approximation.\nSimilarly, the instanton contributions in limits (i) and (ii) can be described\n14We are concerned with compactification on tori, but more generally the BPS condition requires branes to be wrapped on special lagrangian submanifolds (SLAGs) or on\nholomorphic cycles [21].\n\n\fSMALL REPRESENTATIONS, STRING INSTANTONS, AND FOURIER MODES\n\n19\n\nby translating from the M-theory description to the string theory description of the wrapped branes. These wrapped string theory objects comprise:\nthe fundamental string and the Neveu\u2013Schwarz five-brane (NS5-brane) that\ncouple to BNS ; Dp-branes that couple to the Ramond\u2013Ramond (p + 1)-form\npotentials C (p+1) (with \u22121 \u2264 p \u2264 9); and KK charges and KK monopoles\nthat couple to modes of the metric associated with toroidal compactification\non Td .\nKnowledge of this instanton spectrum is a valuable ingredient in understanding the systematics of the Fourier modes of the Eisenstein series that\nenter into the definitions of the coefficients of the low order interactions in\nthe expansion of the scattering amplitude. In particular, it connects closely\nwith the study of the Fourier expansions of specific Eisenstein series that\n(D)\n(D)\nenter into E(0,0) and E(1,0) (that will be discussed later in this paper), as well\nas with the Fourier expansion of the more general automorphic function\n(D)\nE(p,q) (that will not be discussed in this paper).\n3.2. Fourier modes and orbits of BPS charges. The Fourier expansion\nassociated with any parabolic subgroup, P\u03b1 = L\u03b1 U\u03b1 , of Ed+1 is a sum over\ninteger charges that are conjugate to the angular variables that enter in its\nunipotent radical U\u03b1 . These determine the phases of the modes. The Levi\nfactor is a reductive group that has the form L\u03b1 = GL(1) \u00d7 M\u03b1 , where M\u03b1\nis its semisimple component.\nThe conjugation action on U\u03b1 of L\u03b1 \u2013 or more specifically, its intersection with the discrete duality group L\u03b1 \u2229 Ed+1 (Z) \u2013 relates these charges by\nFourier duality. Thus this action carves out orbits within the charge lattice,\nwith each given orbit only covering a subset of the total charge space. This\nviewpoint is expanded upon in more detail in section 4.1. In this subsection we classify these orbits in cruder form, by considering the action of\nthe continuous group L\u03b1 on the charge lattice. Indeed, since we are mainly\ninterested in the algebraic nature of the group action, we sometimes look at\nthe less refined action of the complexification of L\u03b1 , e.g., in order to avoid\nsubtle issues about square roots. Though this loses information by grouping charges into broader families, those families still retain some important\ncommon features.\nAs will be explained in section 4.1, the action of L\u03b1 on the charge lattice\nis related to the adjoint representation on the Lie algebra of U\u03b1 . This\nrepresentation is irreducible if and only if U\u03b1 is abelian. That is the case\nfor the unipotent radicals we consider of every symmetry group Ed+1 (R) of\nrank d + 1 < 6. Otherwise, the Fourier expansion is only well-defined after\naveraging over the commutator subgroup (see (4.3)), and hence does not\ncapture the full content of the function. We devote the rest of this section\nto relating these orbits to BPS instantons in the three limits we consider.\nIn each particular case we will explain the origin of the non-abelian nature\nof the unipotent radicals, which have charges that do not commute with the\n\n\f20\n\nM.B. GREEN, S.D. MILLER, AND P. VANHOVE\n\nother brane charges. A discussion of such effects within string theory can\nbe found, for example, in [23].\nWe now describe the adjoint action V\u03b1\u0302 on the unipotent radical, where \u03b1\u0302\nlabels the node immediately adjacent to \u03b1 in the Dynkin diagram (fig. 1).\nFor the three parabolic subgroups of interest to us the representations of the\nunipotent radical are as follows:\n(i) The maximal parabolic P\u03b1d+1 .\nIn this case \u03b1\u0302 = \u03b1d and L\u03b1d+1 = GL(1) \u00d7 Ed .

Both the fundamental representation and the trivial representation of E7 occur, because the\nunipotent radical U\u03b18 is a Heisenberg group. The lower dimensional\nrepresentations are: the fundamental representation for E6 ; a spinor\nrepresentation for Spin(5, 5); the rank 2 antisymmetric tensor representation for SL(5); a bivector representation for SL(3) \u00d7 SL(2);\nand a scalar-vector representation for SL(2) \u00d7 R+ .\n(ii) The maximal parabolic P\u03b11 .\nIn this case \u03b1\u0302 = \u03b13 , which is a spinor node (following the numbering of figure 1) and L\u03b11 = GL(1) \u00d7 Spin(d, d). The representation\nV\u03b1\u0302 always includes a spinor representation of Spin(d, d). It is irreducible except in the cases of d = 6, 7. The case of Spin(6, 6) \u2282 E7\nalso includes a copy of the trivial representation, because the unipotent radical is again a Heisenberg group; the case of Spin(7, 7) \u2282 E8\nalso includes a copy of the standard 14-dimensional \"vector\" representation.\n(iii) The maximal parabolic P\u03b12 .\nIn this case \u03b1\u0302 = \u03b14 and L\u03b12 = GL(1)\u00d7SL(d+1). The representation V\u03b1\u0302 always includes a rank 3 antisymmetric tensor of SL(d + 1),\nvijk , of dimension 3!1 (d + 1)d(d \u2212 1). It is irreducible when the rank is\nless than 6 (see table 3 for the dimensions in the higher rank cases.)\nIn each case, the charges form a lattice within the first listed piece of V\u03b1\u0302 ,\nthat is, the irreducible subrepresentation coming from the \"abelian part\" of\nU\u03b1 . More precisely, these are the nontrivial representations in part (i), the\nspinor representations in part (ii), and the rank 3 antisymmetric tensors vijk\nin part (iii). The space V\u03b1\u0302 is identical with the \"character variety orbit\" u\u22121\nintroduced in section 4.1.\n\n\fSMALL REPRESENTATIONS, STRING INSTANTONS, AND FOURIER MODES\n\n21\n\nGroup\nfirst node second node last node\nSL(3) \u00d7 SL(2) 2\n0\n1\n0\n3\n0\nSL(5)\n4\n0\n4\n0\n6\n0\nSpin(5, 5)\n8\n0\n10\n0\n10\n0\nE6\n16\n0\n20\n1\n16\n0\nE7\n32\n1\n35\n7\n27\n0\nE8\n64\n14\n56 28 + 8 56\n1\nTable 3.

The sum of the two is the dimension of U .\nThe unipotent radical U is abelian when the dimension in\nthe second column is zero; it is a Heisenberg group when this\ndimension equals 1 and even more non-abelian when it is > 1.\n\nBefore proceeding with the explicit list of orbits based on the counting of\nstates and instantons in the next three subsections, we will recall basic properties of the space of nontrivial charges. Apart from the most trivial case\n(with duality group SL(2, Z)), the 12 -BPS orbits only fill a small fraction of\nthe whole space. For the Ed+1 groups with 1 \u2264 d \u2264 5 the complementary\nspace to the 12 -BPS space is filled out by 14 -BPS orbits. For E7 and E8 the\nfull space is spanned by the union of 12 -, 41 - and 18 -BPS orbits. The Fourier\ncoefficients of the BPS protected operators will have nonvanishing Fourier\ncoefficients only associated to these nilpotent orbits. The classification of\npossible charge orbits only depends on the semi-classical nature of the associated BPS configurations, but does not provide any detailed information\nabout strong quantum corrections. Such information should be encoded in\nthe precise form of the instanton contributions to the Fourier modes.\nThe instanton spectrum will now be considered in each of these limits in\nturn. In each case we will list the single BPS instantons that form basepoints\nof the charge orbits. The dimension of the full spaces of charges spanned\nby the orbits in each case of interest is shown in table 3. For each of the\nthree limits (i), (ii), (iii), the two columns in the table show the dimensions\nof the abelian and nonabelian charge spaces, respectively. Since we will be\nonly interested in BPS (supersymmetric) orbits we will not discuss all the\npossible nilpotent orbits of E7 and E8 . A complete discussion of the orbit\nstructure is given in section 6.1.\n3.3. BPS instantons in the decompactification limit: P\u03b1d+1 .\nThe parabolic subgroup of relevance to the expansion of the amplitude in\nD = 10 \u2212 d dimensions when the radius rd defined in (2.9) of one circle of\nthe torus Td becomes large is P\u03b1d+1 , which has Levi factor L\u03b1d+1 = GL(1) \u00d7\n\n\f22\n\nM.B. GREEN, S.D. MILLER, AND P. VANHOVE\n\nEd . In this limit there is a close correspondence between the spectrum of\ninstantons in D = 10 \u2212 d dimensions and the spectrum of black hole states\nin D + 1 = 11 \u2212 d dimensions. This follows from the identification of the\neuclidean world-line of a charged black hole of mass M wrapping around\na circular dimension of radius r with an instanton with action 2\u03c0M r that\ngives rise to an exponential factor of e\u22122\u03c0M r in the amplitude. In addition\nto instantons of this type, there can be instantons that do not decompactify\nto particle states in the higher dimension because their actions are singular\nin the large-r limit. In any dimension there are also instantons with actions\nindependent of r that are inherited from the higher dimension in a trivial\nmanner.\nThe spectrum of BPS black hole states in compactified string theory has\nbeen studied extensively. We will here follow the analysis in [24, 25], which\nconsidered the spectrum of branes wrapped on Td . This generates charged\n1\n1\n2 - and 4 - BPS black hole states that correspond to singular solutions in\nsupergravity since they have zero horizon size and hence zero entropy. In\naddition, for E6 , E7 and E8 there are 18 -BPS states that correspond to black\nholes that have non-zero entropy (as well as states with zero entropy), the\nprototypes being the analysis of black holes in D = 5 dimensions (with E6\nduality group) in [26, 27]. The discussion of the associated nilpotent orbits\nwas given in [28]. Our main interest is to extend the analysis in order to\naccount for BPS instantons.\nWe shall, for convenience, use the M-theory description starting from\neleven dimensional supergravity compactified on a (d + 1)-torus that will be\ndenoted T d+1 . The BPS particle states in any dimension are obtained by\nwrapping all the spatial dimensions of the various extended objects in supergravity around the torus. These include the M 2-brane and the M 5-brane,\ntogether with the Kaluza\u2013Klein modes of the metric and the magnetic dual\nKaluza\u2013Klein monopoles. The BPS instantons can be listed by completely\nwrapping the euclidean world-volumes of these objects on these tori.\nDespite their similarities, there is a fundamental mathematical difference\nbetween the orbits of BPS states and the orbits of BPS instantons. The\nformer are orbits under the semisimple part M\u03b1d+1 of the Levi component\nL\u03b1d+1 = GL(1) \u00d7 M\u03b1d+1 , while the latter are orbits under the larger group\nL\u03b1d+1 itself. Often these orbits coincide, but not always: the 27-dimensional\norbit of E6 and 56-dimensional orbit of E7 are actually unions of infinitely\nmany M\u03b1d+1 -orbits which are related by the GL(1) action. This GL(1)\naction is reminicent of the so-called trombone symmetry of supergravity [29].\nSimilar examples occur in other limits as well. The GL(1) parameter, r,\ndescribed in (2.9) is always normalized to act by the scalar factor of r2\non the BPS instantons, and so never acts trivially. This action is typically\ncompensated by a different GL(1) factor in the stabilizer of a BPS instanton.\nWhen this happens we will shorten the orbit notation by canceling these two\nfactors, even though they are mathematically different. We use a horizontal\nG\nof a group G by a stabilizer H, in order to match\nline to denote a quotient H\n\n\fSMALL REPRESENTATIONS, STRING INSTANTONS, AND FOURIER MODES\n\n23\n\nD=\nM\u03b1d+1 = Ed\ndim point charges dim instanton charges\n10 \u2212 d\n= dim U\u03b1d+1\n= # +ve roots of Ed\n10A\n1\n1\n0\n10B\nSL(2)\n0\n1\n9\nSL(2) \u00d7 R+\n3\n1\n8\nSL(3) \u00d7 SL(2)\n6\n4\n7\nSL(5)\n10\n10\n6\nSpin(5, 5)\n16\n20\n5\nE6\n27\n36\n4\nE7\n56 (57)\n63\n3\nE8\n120\n120\nTable 4.

The details of the enumeration of BPS states\nand instantons in the decompactification limit are reviewed in appendix C,\nthe results of which are summarised in this subsection. These states are\nlabelled by a set of charges that couple to components of the various tensor\npotentials in the theory and span a space whose dimension is given in the\nsecond-to-last column of table 4 for each Levi group, M\u03b1d+1 , with 0 \u2264 d \u2264 7.\nCorrespondingly, the dimension of the space of instanton charges is given\nin the last column. Table 5 lists the BPS orbits for each Levi group in the\nrange 0 \u2264 d \u2264 7.\nTable 4 shows that, with one exception, the number of BPS instantons in\ndimension D equals the sum of the number of BPS particle states and the\nBPS instantons in dimension D + 1, as anticipated above. The exceptional\ncase is the parabolic subgroup with M\u03b18 = E7 , where the number of instantons, 120, is one greater than the number of BPS states, 56, plus instantons,\n63 in D = 4. The string theory interpretation of this extra state is discussed\nat the end of section 3.4.1.\nThe BPS orbits for each value of d = 10 \u2212 D with Levi factor L\u03b1d+1 =\nGL(1) \u00d7 Ed are shown in table 5.

With one exception these are orbits\nof charged black hole states satisfying fractional BPS conditions that are generated by the action of the Levi subgroup,\nGL(1) \u00d7 Ed , on a representative BPS state. The notation\nis explained in the text. The degenerate case with d = 0 is\nomitted here but will be discussed in section 4.2. The information in the third and fourth columns is taken from [24]\nand [28], respectively. Details are provided in appendix C.\nNote the presence of the nonabelian 33-dimensional unipotent radical R32 n R in the 14 -BPS entry for E7 .\n\n\fSMALL REPRESENTATIONS, STRING INSTANTONS, AND FOURIER MODES\n\n25\n\ngeneral feature that is valid for d > 1 is that the 12 -BPS states fill out orbits\nof the form\nEd+1\nO 1 \u2212BP S =\n,\n(n3 , . . . , n7 ) = (3, 6, 10, 16, 27) .\n(3.2)\n2\nEd n Rnd+1\nThe integers nd+1 are the dimensions of the unipotent radicals, U\u03b1d+1 , listed\nin table 3; they are also the dimensions of the spaces of BPS point charges\nfor the symmetry groups Ed+1 listed in table 4, apart from the case of d = 7\nwhere U\u03b18 is a non-abelian Heisenberg group. As mentioned earlier, U\u03b18\nhas dimension 57 while the E7 point-like states (charged black holes) are\nlabelled by only 56 charges. The missing charge arises from the fact that\namong the 120 instantons in D = 3 dimensions (see table 4) there is one\nthat is a wrapped KKM with x# (the fibre coordinate in (3.1)) wrapped\naround the direction that is identified with (euclidean) time. Since particle\nstates in D = 4 dimensions are obtained by identifying the decompactified\ndirection with time, the exceptional instanton is one for which x# grows in\nthe cusp and its action becomes singular. By contrast, 56 of the D = 3\ninstantons have action proportional to r7 and are seen as point-like states in\nfour dimensions, and the other 63 have no r7 dependence and decompactify\nto instantons in four dimensions.\nIt is interesting to speculate about an additional line to table 5 which we\ndid not list, namely one for M\u03b19 = E8 inside the affine Kac-Moody group\nE9 . While this latter group is infinite dimensional, one can still make sense\nof the orbits in terms of the finite dimensional vector space u\u22121 in (4.5).\nIndeed, u\u22121 here is 248-dimensional and the action of E8 is equivalent to\nthe adjoint action on its Lie algebra. Thus the orbits there coincide with\nthe coadjoint nilpotent orbits for E8 .\n3.4. The string perturbation theory limit: P\u03b11 . In this limit BPS\ninstantons give non-perturbative corrections to string perturbation theory.\nThis involves an expansion in the parabolic subgroup P\u03b11 , with Levi factor\nL\u03b11 = GL(1) \u00d7 Spin(d, d). This limit is analogous to the limit considered in\nthe previous subsection with the role of the decompactifying circle radius,\nrd , replaced by the inverse string coupling in D = 10 \u2212 d dimensions, which\n\u221a\nis denoted 1/ yD . In this case the orbits of BPS charges do not correspond\nto black hole charge orbits.\nThe BPS instantons that enter in this limit are easiest to analyse in\nterms of the wrapping of euclidean world-volumes of Dp-branes, the NS5brane and stringy KKM instantons. The Dp-branes enter for all values of\nd \u2265 0 and their contribution alone leads to an abelian unipotent radical,\nU\u03b11 . The NS5-branes contribute on tori of dimension d \u2265 6 and the KKM\ninstantons contribute for d = 7. Both these kinds of instantons render the\nunipotent radical nonabelian. In section 3.4.1 and appendix D we review\nthe classification of Dp-brane instantons in terms of the classification of\nSpin(d, d) chiral spinor orbits, which leads to the following features:\n\u2022 For d \u2264 3 there is only one non-trivial orbit, which is 21 -BPS.\n\n\f26\n\nM.B.

For d = 6 and d = 7\nthere is again a single 41 -BPS orbit given by constrained spinors,\nwhich has dimensions 25 and 35, respectively.\n\u2022 For d = 4 the 12 -BPS orbit is parameterised by a spinor satisfying\nthe Spin(4, 4) pure spinor constraint, S * S = 0, while the full eightcomponent spinor space (with S * S 6= 0) parameterises the 14 -BPS\norbit.\n\u2022 For d = 5 the 21 -BPS orbit is parameterised by an Spin(5, 5) spinor\nsatisfying the pure spinor constraint,15 S\u0393i S = 0, and once again\nthe unconstrained spinor parameterises the 14 -BPS orbit.\n\u2022 For d = 6 the 21 -BPS orbit is defined by an Spin(6, 6) spinor satisfying the pure spinor constraint,\nF2 :=\n\n1\n2\n\n12\nX\ni,j=1\n\nS\u0393ij S dxi \u2227 dxj\n\n= 0,\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere the 41 -BPS orbit is parameterised by a spinor satisfying the\nweaker constraints\nF2 6= 0 ,\n\nIn addition there is a\nof a spinor satisfying\n\n1\n8 -BPS\n\nF2 \u2227 F2 6= 0 ,\n\nF2 \u2227 F2 = 0 .\n\n(3.4)\n\norbit which is identified with the space\n\u2217F2 \u2227 F2 = 0 ,\n\n(3.5)\n1\n8 -BPS\n\norbit idenwhere \u2217 is the Hodge star operator, and a second\ntified with the space spanned by an unconstrained 32-component\nspinor.\n\u2022 For d = 7 there are nine nontrivial orbits (in addition to the trivial\norbit) that were determined by Popov [30]. The 21 -BPS case is the\nsmallest non-trivial orbit, which is the space spanned by a spinor\nsatisfying\nF3 :=\n\n14\n1 X\nS\u0393ijk S dxi \u2227 dxj \u2227 dxk\n3!\n\n= 0,\n\n(3.6)\n\ni,j,k=1\n\nwhere S is a Spin(7, 7) spinor and \u0393i (i = 1, . . . , 14) are corresponding Dirac matrices. However, the description of the remaining orbits\nin terms of covariant constraints involving F3 analogous to those of\n(3.4) and (3.5) is apparently unknown.\nWe now turn to a detailed description of these orbits, which draws from\nthe information in section 6.1.\n15The Dirac matrices \u0393i (i = 1, . . . 2d) form a 2 d2 \u22121 \u00d72 d2 \u22121 representation of the Clifford\n\nalgebra C`(d,Pd).

Classification of spinor orbits. A review of the method for classifying\nspinor orbits of G = Spin(d, d), when viewed as the subgroup of even and\ninvertible elements of the Clifford algebra C`(d, d) associated with SO(d, d),\ncan be found in [31] (based on the original work in [32] for d \u2264 6, and [30]\nfor d = 7).\nThe following tables will summarise some facts about these orbits, which\nare typically cosets of the form O = Spin(d, d)/H, H being the stabilizer\nof a point in the orbit; in three particular cases the quotients are actually\n(GL(1)\u00d7G)/H for reasons similar to those explained just above section 3.3.1.\nSince we do not require any specific features of these orbits we shall simplify\ntheir description by writing the real points the corresponding complex algebraic variety. For each value of d we will give a representative spinor of each\norbit (labelled S 0 in column 1 and defined in appendix D), together with\nits stabiliser (H in column 2), its dimension (dim(G/H) in column 3) and\nthe fraction of supersymmetry it preserves \u2013 i.e., its BPS degree N/2d\u22121 ,\nwhich is determined by the number of linearly independent spinors N of the\norbit representative S 0 . In the following we will only list the BPS orbits\nappearing into the Fourier coefficients of the coefficients we are interested\nin. A more complete discussion is given in section 6.1.\nThe tables that follow have the following general properties:\n\u2022 The bottom row is the trivial orbit and the top row is the dense\norbit of a full spinor.\n\u2022 The second to bottom row is the smallest non-trivial orbit, which is\nthe 21 -BPS configuration with orbit parametrized by the coset16\nO1\n\n2 \u2212BP S\n\n=\n\nSpin(d, d)\nSL(d) n R\n\n(3.7)\n\nd(d\u22121)\n2\n\nof dimension 1+d(d\u22121)/2. This is the orbit of a spinor satisfying the\npure spinor constraint and can be obtained by acting on the ground\nstate of the Fock space representation of the spinor with SO(d, d)\nrotations.\n\u2022 The third to bottom row is the second smallest non-trivial orbit (the\nNTM, or 14 -BPS, orbit), which arises for d \u2265 4 and is the coset\nO1\n\n4 \u2212BP S\n\n=\n\nSpin(d, d)\n,\n(Spin(7) \u00d7 SL(d \u2212 4)) n U (d\u22124)(d+11)\n\n(3.8)\n\n2\n\nwhere Us is a unipotent group of dimension s (which is nonabelian\nfor d \u2265 6).\nIn more detail, the specific orbits for each Spin(d, d) group are as follows:\nI Spin(1, 1) is trivial. For Spin(2, 2) and Spin(3, 3) the action of the spin\ngroup is transitive and there are only two orbits: the trivial one of dimension\n16Although the orbits listed in this section are over R or C, the structures are largely\nindependent of the ground field.

Neveu\u2013Schwarz five-brane and stringy KKM instantons.\nThe wrapped world-volume of the NS5-brane produces a new kind of\ninstanton when d \u2265 6, which is a source of BNS flux. Whereas the Dp-brane\ninstantons have actions of the form C/gs with C independent of gs , the\nwrapped NS5-brane has an action of the form C/gs2 . This means that such\n2\nNS5-instantons are suppressed by e\u2212C/gs , and so, in the string perturbation\ntheory regime they are suppressed relative to the Dp-brane instantons. The\npresence of the charge carried by this wrapped NS5-brane instanton leads\nto a non-commutativity of the unipotent radical, U\u03b11 , which is a Heisenberg\ngroup (this is analogous to the fact that the KKM instanton in D = 3\nled to non-commutativity of the unipotent radical U\u03b18 in the P\u03b18 parabolic\nsubgroup of E8 ). The non-commutativity arises because the presence of\na NS5-brane charge generates a non-trivial BNS background. This affects\nthe definition of the D-brane charges due to the dependence on BNS of\ntheir field-strengths, F (4) := dC (3) + dBNS \u2227 C (1) and \u2217F (4) = dC (5) +\nC (3) \u2227 dBNS \u2212 dC (3) \u2227 BNS . Since there is only one euclidean NS5-brane\nconfiguration on a 6-torus (the D = 4 case) the non-commutative part of\nU\u03b11 is one-dimensional, so the unipotent radical forms a Heisenberg group.\nUpon further compactification on T7 to D = 3 there are 7 distinct\nwrapped NS5-brane world-volume instantons, one for each six-cycle. In addition, there are 8 M-theory KKM instantons that are distinguished from\neach other in the M-theory description by identifying the coordinate x# with\nany one of the 1-cycles, as explained earlier. In string language, one of these\nis the wrapped euclidean D6-brane that has been counted as one of the 64\ncomponents of the SO(7, 7) spinor space and contributes to the abelian part\nof the unipotent radical U\u03b11 . The other 7 are KKM instantons with x#\nidentified with a circle in one of the 7 other directions. These are T-dual\nto the 7 wrapped NS5-branes. The presence of the D6-brane and KKM\ninstantons leads to a higher degree of non-commutativity of the unipotent\nradical, due for example, to the non-linear dependence of the D6-brane field\n\n\f30\n\nM.B.

The Fourier modes of interest are those associated with the maximal\nparabolic subgroup P\u03b12 , which has Levi subgroup L\u03b12 = GL(1) \u00d7 SL(d + 1).\nThe constant terms in the Fourier expansion were considered in [1] and\nshown to match expectations based on perturbative eleven-dimensional supergravity.\nThe instanton charge space can be described as follows. The wrapped KK\nworld-lines do not give instantons in this limit since their action is independent of the volume, Vd+1 . Wrapped euclidean M 2-branes appear in D \u2264 8\ndimensions (corresponding to symmetry groups with rank \u2265 3), while the\nwrapped euclidean M 5-brane arises for D \u2264 5 dimensions (corresponding\nto symmetry groups with rank \u2265 6) and the wrapped world-volume associated with the KKM enters first in D = 3 dimensions (i.e., for symmetry\ngroup E8 ). These instanton actions have the exponentially suppressed form\na ), where C is independent of V\nexp(\u2212CVd+1\nd+1 in the limit Vd+1 \u2192 \u221e, and\na = 3/(d + 1) for the wrapped M 2-brane, a = 6/(d + 1) for the wrapped\nM 5-brane and a = 7/(d + 1) for the wrapped KKM .\nThe space spanned by the 3-form, v[ijk] that couples to M 2-brane worldsheets wrapping 3-cycles inside the M -theory torus T d+1 has dimension\nd+1\n=\nDM\n2\n\n(d + 1)!\n,\n3! (d \u2212 2)!\n\n(3.9)\n\nwhich equals 1, 4, 10, 20, 35, and 56, respectively, for tori of dimensions\nd + 1 = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 (corresponding to the duality groups E3 , . . . , E8 ).\nSimilarly, the space of euclidean five-branes wrapping 6-cycles inside T d+1\nhas dimension\n(d + 1)!\nd+1\nDM\n,\n(3.10)\n5 =\n6!(d \u2212 5)!\nwhich equals 1, 7, and 28, respectively, for d+1 = 6, 7, and 8 (corresponding\nto duality groups E6 , E7 , and E8 ). Finally, a finite action KKM instanton\nonly exists if there are 8 circular dimensions, so it only contributes for the\nE8 case. As argued earlier, there are 8 distinct objects of this kind since x#\nis distinguished from the other circular coordinates.\nAgain these dimensions can be compared with those listed in section 6.1\nand summarised in table 3 on page 21 under the heading \"second node\".\nThe wrapped euclidean M 2-branes contribute the dimensions of abelian part\n\n\fSMALL REPRESENTATIONS, STRING INSTANTONS, AND FOURIER MODES\n\n31\n\nof the unipotent radical for this maximal parabolic subgroup. In fact the\nnumbers in the left-hand column of the second node heading are equal to\nd+1\nd+1\nDM\n2 for all 0 \u2264 d \u2264 7. The M 5-brane charge space of dimension DM 5 ,\nequals the dimension of the non-commutative part (i.e., derived subgroup) of\nthe unipotent radical for E6 and E7 , while for E8 there is also a contribution\nof 8 from the KKM instantons. In this case the non-abelian component of\nthe unipotent radical arises from the KKM instanton dependence on the\n3-form A(3) configurations (analogous to the way the BNS configurations\ninduced the non-commutativity in the previous section).\nAlthough we have given a list of dimensions of the space spanned by the\norbits, in this case we have not analysed the BPS conditions to discover how\nthe complete space decomposes into orbits with fractional supersymmetry.\nHowever, the latter part of this paper analyses the complete orbit structure\nfor the subgroup P\u03b12 and the list of orbits is given in table 8 on page 60.\nFrom this we can identify, for each value of d, the minimal ( 12 -BPS) and\nNTM ( 41 -BPS) orbits, as well as many others that arise when d \u2265 5 (i.e. for\nE6 , E7 and E8 ).\n4. Explicit examples of Fourier modes for rank \u2264 5.\n4.1. Fourier expansions for higher rank groups. Suppose that \u03c6 \u2208\nC \u221e (\u0393\\G) is an automorphic function, and that A \u2282 G is an abelian subgroup which is isomorphic to Rm for some m > 0. If \u0393 \u2229 A corresponds\nto a lattice in Rm under this identification, then \u03c6's restriction to A, \u03c6(a),\nhas a Fourier expansion. The same is true for any right translate \u03c6(ag), for\ng fixed. A prime example of this is A equal to the unipotent radical U of\na maximal parabolic subgroup P = LU of G, when U is abelian and \u0393 is\narithmetically defined:\nZ\nX\n\u03c6(ug) =\n\u03c7(u)\u03c6\u03c7 (g) , \u03c6\u03c7 (g) =\n\u03c6(ug) \u03c7(u)\u22121 du , (4.1)\n\u0393\u2229U \\U\n\n\u03c7\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all characters \u03c7 of U which are trivial on \u0393 \u2229 U .\nIn particular the special case u = e,\nX\n\u03c6(g) =\n\u03c6\u03c7 (g) ,\n(4.2)\n\u03c7\n\nreconstructs \u03c6 as a sum of its Fourier coefficients \u03c6\u03c7 . These Fourier coefficients are in general distinct from Whittaker functions, which are Fourier\ncoefficients for the minimal parabolic. When U fails to be abelian the coefficients \u03c6\u03c7 defined by (4.1) still make sense, though \u03c6 is no longer a sum of\nthem. Instead, it is the integral of \u03c6 over the commutator subgroup18 [U, U ]\n18The commutator subgroup [U, U ] is the smallest normal subgroup of U which contains\n\nall elements of the form [u1 , u2 ], for u1 , u2 \u2208 U .\n\n\f32\n\nM.B.

In our case, in which U is the unipotent radical of\na maximal parabolic subgroup P = P\u03b1j for some simple root \u03b1j , u has a\ngraded structure\nu = u1 \u2295 u2 \u2295 * * *\n(4.4)\nP\nwhere uk is the span of root vectors for roots of the form \u03b1 =\nck \u03b1k ,\nwith cj = k. The Killing form B(*, *) exhibits the dual u\u2217 of u as the\ncomplexification of the Lie algebra\nu\u2212 = u\u22121 \u2295 u\u22122 \u2295 * * * .\n\n(4.5)\n\nThe commutator subgroup [U, U ] has Lie algebra u2 \u2295 u3 \u2295 * * * , so the differential of a character is sensitive only to u1 . Again through the bilinear\npairing of the Killing form, its dual space u\u22171 is isomorphic to the complexification u\u22121 \u2297 C of u\u22121 . The exponential of any such a linear functional is a\ncharacter of U , and hence u\u22121 \u2297 C is known as the character variety of U .\nNow let \u03c7 be a character of U which is invariant under the discrete subgroup \u0393\u2229U . The above correspondence guarantees the existence of a unique\nY \u2208 u\u22121 \u2297 C\n\nsuch that\n\n\u03c7(eX ) = eiB(Y,X) .\n\n(4.6)\n\nThe set of all such Y produced from characters \u03c7 of (\u0393 \u2229 U )\\U forms the\ncharge lattice in u\u22121 .

In terms of (4.6)\n\u22121\n\n\u03c7(\u03b3eX \u03b3 \u22121 ) = \u03c7(e\u03b3X\u03b3 ) = eiB(Y,\u03b3X\u03b3\n\n\u22121 )\n\n= eiB(\u03b3\n\n\u22121 Y\n\n\u03b3,X)\n\n,\n\n(4.8)\n\nbecause of the invariance of the Killing form under the adjoint action; the\ncharacter in the second line of (4.7) is hence equal to the character for the\nLie algebra element \u03b3 \u22121 Y \u03b3 \u2208 u\u22121 \u2297 C.\nConsequently, the Fourier coefficients (4.1) are related for characters \u03c7\nwhich lie in the same \u0393 \u2229 L-orbit under the adjoint action on u\u22121 \u2297 C. It\nshould be remarked that u\u22121 \u2013 like each space uj \u2013 is invariant under the\nadjoint action of L, and in fact furnishes an irreducible representation of\nL (a fact which can be verified in each example using the Weyl character\n\n\fSMALL REPRESENTATIONS, STRING INSTANTONS, AND FOURIER MODES\n\n33\n\nformula \u2013 see the tables in [33, \u00a75], for example, for a complete list). The\ncomplexification LC of L likewise acts on u\u22121 \u2297C according to an irreducible\nrepresentation, and carves it up into finitely many complex character variety\norbits.\nSimilarly, the adjoint action of \u0393\u2229L on the set of characters of U which are\ntrivial on \u0393 \u2229 U refines these complex orbits into myriad further \"integral\"\norbits. Those characters naturally form a lattice inside of iu\u22121 \u2282 u\u22121 \u2297 C,\nand this last action is that of a discrete subgroup of L on a lattice, e.g., the\naction of GL(n, Z) on Zn in a particular special case. The integral orbits are\nmore subtle to describe because of number-theoretic reasons; indeed, even\ndescribing \u0393 \u2229 L for a large exceptional group is quite complicated.\nEach of these complex character variety orbits (and hence each of the\n\u0393\u2229L-orbits on the set of characters that are trivial on \u0393\u2229U ) is thus contained\nin a single (complex) coadjoint nilpotent orbit. It therefore makes sense to\ncategorize the complex character variety orbits by giving their basepoints\nand dimensions. Some of this information was provided in section 3, based\non the analysis of BPS states in string theory. This analysis focused on the\nsupersymmetric orbits and did not cover all possible orbits. A systematic\nand detailed analysis of the remaining orbits for the maximal parabolic\nsubgroups we study will be given in 6.1. These have long been known\nfor the classical groups by the study of \"classical rank theory\"; the paper\n[33] contains a listing for all maximal parabolic subgroups of exceptional\ngroups. In addition, the integral orbits are also known in some important\ncases: Bhargava [34, Section 4] and Krutelevich [35] treat certain cases, with\nadditional cases to appear in forthcoming work of Bhargava.\nNote that the calculation (4.7) shows that each coefficient \u03c6\u03c7 \u2013 which is\ndetermined by its values on L \u2013 is automorphic under any \u03b3 that lies in both\n\u0393 and StabL (\u03c7), the stabilizer of \u03c7 within L. In terms of the differential,\nthese are the elements of \u0393 \u2229 L for which the adjoint action fixes the element\nY \u2208 u\u22121 \u2297C from (4.6). One can therefore use (4.7) to write the sum of \u03c6\u03c7 (g)\nranging over \u03c7 in one of the integral orbits, as the sum of left \u03b3-translates\nof a fixed \u03c6\u03c7 , where \u03b3 now ranges over cosets of \u0393 \u2229 L modulo the stabilizer\nof this fixed character. This shows that not all of the Fourier coefficients\nneed to be computed individually; knowing them for orbit representatives of\ncharacters is tantamount to knowing them for all characters. Furthermore,\nthe vanishing of any Fourier coefficient \u03c6\u03c7 as a function of L is equivalent\nto that of all Fourier coefficients in its orbit.\nThe following subsections (together with details that are presented in\nappendix H) concern some specific, explicit examples of the Fourier modes\n(D)\n(D)\nof the coefficient functions E(0,0) and E(1,0) for the low rank duality groups\nwith d \u2264 4 (i.e. D \u2265 6). In these cases standard, classical techniques can\nbe used to obtain exact expressions, including the arithmetical divisor sums\nthat appear. These techniques have the virtue of being relatively simple in\nthese special low rank cases; the higher rank cases of E6 , E7 and E8 will be\n\n\f34\n\nM.B. GREEN, S.D. MILLER, AND P. VANHOVE\n\ndiscussed in the later sections, although without precise calculations \u2013 our\nchief contribution is to use representation theory to show that many of them\nvanish. The divisor sums could also be calculated using Hecke operators,\nthough we do not do so here.\nIn each particular case we will explicitly identify the character \u03c7, which\nlies in the lattice of characters of U that are trivial on \u0393 \u2229 U , with a tuple\nof integral parameters mi , and use the notation\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0001\n(D)\u03b1\n(D)\nG\u03b1\nG\nF(p,q) (`; mi ) :=\nE(p,q) (`) and\nF\u03b2;s\n(`; mi ) := E\u03b2;s\n(`) (4.9)\n\u03c7\n\u03c7\n\n(D)\n\nG , respectively. For brevity we\nto refer to the Fourier modes of E(p,q) and E\u03b2;s\nshall sometimes drop the dependence on ` \u2208 L from the notation.\nThe precise details of these Fourier coefficients could, in principle, be independently checked against an explicit evaluation of instanton contributions\nto the graviton scattering amplitude, but in practice such detailed verification is very difficult. However, most details of the contribution of 12 -BPS\ninstantons to these coefficients in limit (i), the decompactification limit in\nwhich rd \u001d 1, can be motivated directly from string theory. This is the\nlimit in which, for these low rank cases, the instantons are identified with\nwrapped world-lines of small black holes of the (D + 1)-dimensional theory.\nThe asymptotic behaviour can be understood by studying the fluctuations\naround 12 -BPS D-particle configurations in a manner that generalises the\narguments of [36], leading to an expression for the modes in D = 10 \u2212 d \u2264 9\ndimensions of the form\n\u0011\ne\u2212SD (k) \u0010\n(D)\u03b1\n`D+1\nrd nD\nc\n+\nO(\n) \u03c37\u2212D (|k|)\n)\n.

Such states can\nform threshold bound D-particles of mass p m 1 . The divisor sum, \u03c3n (k) =\n2\nP\nk n \u03c3\u2212n (k) = q|k q n , sums over the winding number q of the world-lines of\nsuch D-particles (where k = p\u00d7q) and can be identified with a matrix model\npartition function. The factor of SD (k)(D\u22128)/2 comes from integration over\nthe bosonic and fermionic zero modes and nD is a constant that depends on\nthe dimension D. Because of the high degree of supersymmetry preserved\nby the 21 -BPS configuration it turns out that this approximation is exact\nin several cases. In D = 6 our results are in agreement with [7]. We have\nnot completed an independent quantum calculation of the 41 -BPS instanton\ncontributions, which are more subtle. We do not know a general pattern\nfor the exponent nD , though it is easily computable in each of the examples\nbelow.\n\n\fSMALL REPRESENTATIONS, STRING INSTANTONS, AND FOURIER MODES\n\n35\n\nThe Fourier coefficients for different characters satisfy a number of relations between them due to (4.7). This phenomenon is particularly striking on\nthe symmetry groups with D \u2265 7, which are products of SL(n)'s. For example, the formula in (4.31) depends on p1 and p2 only through the combination\n|p2 + p1 \u03a9|, which is actually an instance of the principle in (4.7) (see [37]\nfor more details). Thus these coefficient functions (aside from a substitution\nin their argument) are determined by the ones having (p1 , p2 ) = (1, 0). In\ngeneral, a theorem of Piatetski-Shapiro [38] and Shalika [39] computes the\nFourier expansion of an automorphic form on SL(n) in terms of similarly\nsimple Fourier coefficients. In particular, they demonstrate that the \"abelian\nFourier coefficients\" that appear in (4.3) determine ones absent there that\ncome from nonabelian charges.\nHowever, this theorem is not true for groups other than SL(n). Certain\nfeatures still persist for the \"small\" automorphic representations which are\nthe focus of this paper; see [33, section 4] for the analogous result for minimal\nautomorphic representations of E6 and E7 . An expression that includes\ncontributions from non-commutative charges (which are not addressed in\nthis paper) is presented in [7] in the case of D = 3. See also [40\u201342] for a\ndiscussion of noncommutative contributions in a different context.\n4.2. D = 10B: SL(2, Z). The simplest nontrivial (but very degenerate)\nexample arises in the case of the IIB theory with D = 10, where the discrete\nduality group is SL(2, Z).19 In this case the 21 - and 14 -BPS interactions,\n(10)\n\n(10)\n\nE(0,0) and E(1,0) , are given by Eisenstein series [43, 44]\n(10)\n\nSL(2)\n\nE(0,0) = 2\u03b6(3) E 3\n\n(\u03a9) ,\n\n2\n\n(10)\n\nSL(2)\n\nE(1,0) = \u03b6(5) E 5\n\n(\u03a9) ,\n\n(4.11)\n\n2\n\nSL(2)\n\nwhere Es\n(\u03a9) is a non-holomorphic Eisenstein series and \u03a9 := \u03a91 +i\u03a92 =\n\u221a\nC (0) + i/ y10 .\nIt is useful to parametrize the coset space SL(2, R)/SO(2) (i.e., the upper\nhalf plane) associated with the continuous symmetry group, SL(2, R), by\nmatrix representatives of the form\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\u221a\n\u0013\n\u03a92\n0\n1 \u03a91\ne2 =\n.\n(4.12)\n\u221a1\n0\n0 1\n\u03a92\nThis matrix lies in the maximal parabolic subgroup of upper triangular\nmatrices in SL(2, R); its first factor is in the unipotent radical and the\nsecond factor lies in its standard Levi component.

In this\nlimit the expansion of the coefficient functions is dominated by the two\nSL(2)\npower behaved constant terms in the zero mode Fs\n(0) in (4.16), while\nthe non-zero modes have asymptotic behaviour at large \u03a92 ,\n\u0001\n\u03c32s\u22121 (|n|) \u22122\u03c0|n|\u03a92\n\u22121\n)\n,\n(4.18)\nFsSL(2) (n) =\ne\n1\n+\nO(\u03a9\n2\n\u03be(2s)|n|s\nwhere the asymptotic expansion of the Bessel function\nr\n\u0001\n\u03c0 \u2212x\nK\u03bd (x) =\ne\n1 + O(x\u22121 ) , x \u001d 1 ,\n(4.19)\n2x\nhas been used.\nThe two power behaved terms in (4.16) have the interpretation of terms\nin string perturbation theory, which is an expansion in y10 , the square of\nthe string coupling constant. Furthermore, the Eisenstein series with s =\n3/2 and with s = 5/2 have the correct power-behaved terms to account\nprecisely for the known behaviour of the R4 and \u2202 4 R4 terms in the low\nenergy expansion of the four graviton amplitude in 10 dimensions. In [1]\nit was shown that this is in agreement with string perturbation theory and\nextends to the higher rank cases where the pattern of constant terms is more\nelaborate. Furthermore, the exponential terms in the expansion in (4.18)\ncorrespond to the expected D-instantons that arise in the D = 10 type IIB\ntheory. This illustrates the fact, common to all BPS instanton processes,\n\n\fSMALL REPRESENTATIONS, STRING INSTANTONS, AND FOURIER MODES\n\n37\n\nthat the exponential decay of a Fourier mode is proportional to the charge n\nthat determines the phase of the mode. The correction term of order \u03a9\u22121\n2 in\n(4.18) indicates perturbative corrections to the instanton contribution given\nby an expansion in powers of the string coupling constant that corresponds\nto the addition of boundaries in the Riemann surface.\nIn this case the only instantons are 12 -BPS D-instantons \u2013 there are no\n1\n4 -BPS instantons in the ten-dimensional type IIB theory. However, it is\nknown from string theory arguments that the Eisenstein series at s = 3/2\nis associated with the 21 -BPS R4 term while the series at s = 5/2 is associated with the 14 -BPS \u2202 4 R4 contribution (4.11). This leaves unresolved the\nquestion as to what features of these series at special values of s encode the\nfraction of supersymmetry that these terms preserve? This must be encoded\nin the measure. Indeed in the s = 3/2 case it was argued in [36, 45] that\nthe measure factor \u03c32 (|n|) arises from the 12 -BPS D-instanton matrix model,\nwhich was verified in [46]. Presumably, the s = 5/2 measure should arise in\na similar manner.\nIn most of the higher-rank examples that follow there is a less subtle\ndistinction between the 12 -BPS and 14 -BPS cases since in typical cases there\nare 14 -BPS instanton configurations that break 43 of the supersymmetry. As\nwill be shown in the following, these generally enter into non-zero Fourier\n(D)\nmodes of the coefficient E(1,0) for 3 \u2264 D < 10 (although, as will also be seen\nlater, only the 12 -BPS orbit contributes in the P\u03b11 parabolic with D = 7, 8, 9).\nThe subtleties of the measure factor are not required in order to identify the\nfraction of supersymmetry preserved in such cases. However, there are no 81 BPS configurations for D > 5. Therefore, for D > 5 the distinction between\n(D)\nthe coefficient E(0,1) and the ones which preserve more supersymmetry is\nagain not determined by the spectrum of instantons that contribute in the\nvarious limits under consideration.

The form of this measure factor can\nalso be seen from a simple duality argument using the fact that the wrapped\nM 2-brane instanton is related to the Kaluza\u2013Klein world-line instanton by\nthe SL(2, Z) part of the duality group.\n\u221a This duality interchanges T and U\nand, hence, the factor exp(\u22122\u03c0|k|/ \u03a92 \u03bd2 ) = exp(\u22122\u03c0|k| T2 ) in (4.31) for\np1 = 0 and p2 = 1 is related to exp(\u22122\u03c0|k| U2 ) in (4.46). This explains the\nfact that the measure factor, \u03c3\u22121 (|k|), is the same in both these equations.\n\n4.5.

The next to minimal (NTM) representation\nThis section contains the proof of theorem 2.14, drawing on some results\nin representation theory that can be found in appendix A by Ciubotaru and\nTrapa. As we remarked just before its statement, cases (i) and (ii) are by now\nwell known, and so we restrict our attention to case (iii): the s = 5/2 series.\nTo set some terminology, let G = N AK be the Iwasawa decomposition of the\nsplit real Lie group G, B the minimal parabolic subgroup of G containing\nN A, and aC = a \u2297R C be the complexification of the Lie algebra of A.\nWithout any loss of generality we may assume it is the complex span of the\nChevalley basis vectors H\u03b1 , where \u03b1 ranges over the positive simple roots.\nFor any \u03bb \u2208 a\u2217C , the dual space of complex valued linear functionals on aC ,\ndefine the vector space of functions on G\nn\no\nV\u03bb :=\nf : G \u2192 C | f (nag) = e(\u03bb+\u03c1)(H(a)) f (g), \u2200 n \u2208 N, a \u2208 A, g \u2208 G .\n(5.1)\nThe transformation law and Iwasawa decomposition show that all functions\nin V\u03bb are determined by their restriction to K. Then G acts on V\u03bb by the\nright translation operator\n(\u03c0\u03bb (h)f ) (g) := f (gh) ,\n\n(5.2)\n\nmaking (\u03c0\u03bb , V\u03bb ) into a representation of G commonly called a (nonunitary)\nprincipal series representation. It is irreducible for \u03bb in an open dense subset of a\u2217C , but reduces at special points with certain integrality properties\n\u2013 such as the ones of interest to us. The representation V\u03bb has a unique\nK-fixed vector up to scaling, namely any function whose restriction to K is\nconstant. These are also known as the spherical vectors of the representation, and any representation which contains them is also called \"spherical\".\nWhen V\u03bb is reducible, it clearly can have at most one irreducible spherical\nsubrepresentation.\nThe minimal parabolic Eisenstein series is defined as\nX\nE G (\u03bb, g) =\ne(\u03bb+\u03c1)(H(\u03b3g)) ,\n(5.3)\n\u03b3\u2208B(Z)\\G(Z)\n\ninitially for \u03bb in Godement's range {\u03bb|h\u03bb, \u03b1i > 1 for all \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a3}, and then\nby meromorphic continuation to a\u2217C . When \u03bb has the form \u03bb = 2s\u03c9\u03b2 \u2212 \u03c1,\nit specializes to the maximal parabolic Eisenstein series (2.12). For generic\n\u03bb in the range of convergence, the right translates of E G (\u03bb, g) span a subspace of functions on G(Z)\\G(R) which furnish a representation of G that is\nequivalent to V\u03bb ; the group action here is also given by the right translation\noperator (5.2). The spherical vectors in this representation are the scalar\n\n\fSMALL REPRESENTATIONS, STRING INSTANTONS, AND FOURIER MODES\n\n57\n\nmultiplies of E G (\u03bb, g), because the function H(g) \u2013 the logarithm of the Iwasawa A-component \u2013 is necessarily right invariant under K. For general \u03bb at\nwhich E G (\u03bb, g) is holomorphic, its right translates span a spherical subrepresentation of V\u03bb , again with the group action given by the right translation\noperator (5.2).\nAs mentioned above, the principal series V\u03bb reduces for special values of \u03bb.\nThis reducibility reflects special behavior of the Eisenstein series E G (\u03bb, g).\nThis is most apparent at the point \u03bb = \u2212\u03c1, where the transformation law\n(5.1) indicates that the constant functions on K extend to constants on\nG, and hence that the trivial representation is a subrepresentation of V\u2212\u03c1 .\nLikewise, the specialization of the minimal parabolic Eisenstein series at\n\u03bb = \u2212\u03c1 is the constant function identically equal to 1, a compatible fact.\nThe proof of theorem 2.14 rests upon special properties of the spherical\nconstituent (i.e., Jordan-H\u00f6lder composition factor) of V\u03bb at the values of\n\u03bb relevant to the s = 5/2 Epstein series. We recall that for this maximal\nparabolic Eisenstein series, \u03bb has the form \u03bb = 2s\u03c9\u03b11 \u2212 \u03c1; it is characterized\nby having inner product 2s \u2212 1 with \u03b11 , and inner product \u22121 with each \u03b1j ,\nj \u2265 2. Write \u03bbdom for the dominant weight in the Weyl orbit of \u03bb, i.e., one\nwhose inner product with all positive roots is nonnegative. Table 6 gives\ndominant weights for the groups in Theorem 2.14 as well as its three values\nof s \u2208 {0, 3/2, 5/2}, although of course only the last value is of immediate\nrelevance in this section.\nThe case of G = E6 is slightly easier than the others because of a lowdimensional coincidence, which in fact is mostly independent of the actual\nvalue of s in that the same statement holds for generic s. Namely, the representation V\u03bb we consider is part of a family of degenerate principal series\nrepresentations, induced from the trivial representation on the semisimple\nSpin(5, 5) factor of the Levi component GL(1) \u00d7 Spin(5, 5) of the maximal\nparabolic subgroup P\u03b11 . These representations are indexed by the one dimensional family \u03bb = 2s\u03c9\u03b11 \u2212 \u03c1, s \u2208 C, which is related to the GL(1) factor.\nThough they may reduce at particular points, their Gelfand-Kirillov dimension26 is equal to the dimension of the unipotent radical of that parabolic,\n16; likewise, any subrepresentation of it cannot have larger dimension. Since\nthe dimension of the wavefront set of a representation is twice the GelfandKirillov dimension, it is bounded by 32. For E6 , the orbits in figure 2 have\ndimensions 0, 22, and 32; all other orbits have larger Gelfand-Kirillov dimension. Hence the orbit attached to the s = 5/2 Eisenstein series for E6\nis either the trivial orbit, the minimal orbit, or the next-to-minimal orbit.\nIt cannot be the trivial orbit, because only the trivial representation is attached to it. Likewise, Kazhdan-Savin [16] proved a uniqueness statement\nfor the minimal orbit, that (up to Weyl equivalence) only the s = 3/2 series\n26The Gelfand-Kirillov dimension is a numerical index of how \"large\" a representation\n\nis; it is half the dimension of the associated coadjoint nilpotent orbit (i.e., the orbit\nwhose closure is the wavefront set of the representation). For example, finite dimensional\nrepresentations have Gelfand-Kirillov dimension equal to zero.\n\n\f58\n\nM.B. GREEN, S.D. MILLER, AND P.

For comparison with [10,16], we have\nlisted the parameters sGRS (the quantity s on [10, p.71]) and\nzKS (the quantify z(G) from [10, p.86]) for s = 3/2, as well\nas their corresponding generalizations for s = 5/2. These\nparameters coincide for the group E8 . The parameter zKS is\nnot defined in the s = 5/2 case for E6 because the relevant\nWeyl orbits do not intersect (cf. [1, Section 3.1]).\n\nis related to the minimal representation. We thus conclude it is attached to\nthe next-to-minimal orbit.\nTo explain the s = 5/2 cases for E7 and E8 we need to rely on some\nrecent results from representation theory, and some notions from there concerning unipotent and special unipotent representations (see appendix A).\nA striking feature from table 6 is that h\u03bbdom , \u03b1j i has all 1's except for a\nsingle zero for the s = 3/2 case, and two zeroes for the s = 5/2 case. This\nphenomenon, which came up here because of physical arguments, also arose\nin work on special unipotent representations. These \u03bbdom each have the\nproperty that there exists an element H of the Cartan subalgebra of g such\nthat [H, X\u03b1 ] = h\u03bbdom , \u03b1j iX\u03b1j for each positive simple root \u0001\u03b1j . Furthermore,\n0\nthere exists a homomorphism from sl2 to g carrying 10 \u22121\nto H, and ( 00 10 )\nto a nilpotent element X. Thus a \"dual\" coadjoint nilpotent orbit, namely\nthe one containing X, is associated to \u03bbdom . In terms of figure 5, in our\nthree examples these related dual orbits are the top three listed, though in\nthe reverse order. Appendix A describes a related construction for more\ngeneral types of orbits beyond the ones considered in this paper.\nAs part of the more general result given in appendix A, corollary A.6\nthen asserts that the spherical constituent of each of the three principal\n\n\fSMALL REPRESENTATIONS, STRING INSTANTONS, AND FOURIER MODES\n\n59\n\nMarking of Orbit\nPrincipal orbit\n\nE6\n[1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nE7\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nE8\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nSubregular orbit\n\n[1,1,1,0,1,1]\n\n[1,1,1,0,1,1,1]\n\n[1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1]\n\n[0,1,1,0,1,1]\n\n[1,1,1,0,1,0,1]\n\n[1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1]\n\nNTM Orbit\n\n[1,0,0,0,0,1]\ndim 32\n\n[0,0,1,0,0,0,0]\ndim 52\n\n[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\ndim 92\n\nMinimal Orbit\n\n[0,1,0,0,0,0]\ndim 22\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,1]\ndim 34\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]\ndim 58\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0]\ndim 0\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\ndim 0\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\ndim 0\n\nSub-subregular\n\n{ Fuzzy structure }\n\nTrivial Orbit\n\nFigure 5.

This action also has 3 complex orbits\n(which can be seen as part of a general description for abelian unipotent\nradicals of maximal parabolic subgroups given in [54]): the trivial orbit; a\n7-dimensional orbit with basepoint Y\u03b12 in the case of node 2, and Y\u03b15 in\nthe case of node 5; and the open, dense 10-dimensional orbit with basepoint\nY01121 + Y11111 (see table 8 or table 9).

Applications of Matumoto's theorem. In Section 2.2.2 we mentioned that representations of real groups have an invariant attached to\nthem, the wavefront set, that in a sense measures how big the representation is. Theorem A.5 indeed computes this wavefront set in many cases,\nincluding ours. There is a theorem due to Matumoto [53] that asserts, in a\nprecise sense, that automorphic forms in small representations cannot have\nlarge Fourier coefficients. Namely, he proves that if an element Y \u2208 u\u22121 associated to the character \u03c7 from (4.6) does not lie in the wavefront set, then\nthe Fourier coefficient \u03c6\u03c7 from (4.1) must vanish identically. We will use real\ngroup methods here in deference to the importance of the underlying symmetry groups Ed+1 (R), but it is notable that we could obtain the same results\nusing p-adic methods via a vanishing result of Moeglin-Waldspurger [56].\nRelated information is given at the end of appendix A.\nFor example, the trivial representation has wavefront set {0}, and likewise the constant function does not have any nontrivial Fourier coefficients.\nIn [33] a detailed analysis is given of the different character variety orbits\nfor each maximal parabolic subgroup of an exceptional group, and which\ncoadjoint nilpotent orbits they are contained in. It is then a simple matter\nto apply Matumoto's theorem and determine a set of Fourier coefficients\nwhich automatically vanishes because their containing coadjoint nilpotent\norbits lie outside the wavefront set. In particular, it is shown in [33] that the\nclosure of the minimal coadjoint nilpotent orbit contains the two smallest\ncharacter variety orbits in each of the examples of P\u03b11 , P\u03b12 , and P\u03b1d+1 for\nthe groups Ed+1 , 5 \u2264 d \u2264 7, but no others (this was known to experts, at\nleast in special cases \u2013 see for example [10]). Likewise, it is also verified there\nthat the closure of the next-to-minimal coadjoint nilpotent orbit contains the\nthree smallest character variety orbits in each of these nine configurations\nof maximal parabolics and Ed+1 groups, but no others.\nCombining this with the characterization in Theorem 2.14 of the wavefront sets for the Epstein series at s = 0, 3/2, and 5/2, we get the following\n\n\f64\n\nM.B. GREEN, S.D. MILLER, AND P. VANHOVE\n\nstatement about the vanishing of Fourier coefficients. This gives a rigorous\nproof of the vanishing statements on page 6.\nTheorem 6.1.

Square integrability of special values of Eisenstein series\n(D)\n\nIn this section we remark that some of the coefficient functions E(0,0) and\n\n(D)\n\nE(1,0) from the expansion (2.3) provide examples of square-integrable automorphic forms on higher rank groups. In particular, we will prove this is\n(D)\nthe case for E(1,0) on E7 and E8 . In light of (1.3), this proves the associated\nautomorphic representation is unitary, since it can be realized in the Hilbert\nspace L2 (Ed+1 (Z)\\Ed+1 (R)). This unitary can also be demonstrated by\npurely representation theoretic methods. It is an instance of broader conjectures of James Arthur on unitary automorphic representations, which are\nstudied in more detail in [57]. This fact about the residual L2 spectrum is at\npresent more of a curiosity as far as our investigations here are concerned,\nsince we are not aware of any particular importance for our applications.\nThe analysis in the proof also determines the exact asymptotics of these\ncoefficients in various limits, generalizing those studied in [1].\nTheorem 7.1. Let G denote the group Ed+1 defined in table 1 on page 4.\n(i) The Epstein series E\u03b1G1 ;0 is constant, and hence always square-integrable.\n(10\u2212d)\n\n(ii) The Epstein series E\u03b1G1 ;3/2 and hence E(0,0)\n4 \u2264 d \u2264 7.\n\nis square-integrable if\n\n\fSMALL REPRESENTATIONS, STRING INSTANTONS, AND FOURIER MODES\n(10\u2212d)\n\n(iii) The Epstein series E\u03b1G1 ;5/2 and hence E(1,0)\n6 \u2264 d \u2264 7.\n\n65\n\nis square-integrable if\n\nCase (i) is obvious since the quotient Ed+1 (Z)\\Ed+1 (R) has finite volume,\nwhile case (ii) was proven earlier by [10]. We have included them here in the\nstatement for convenience and comparison. It should be stressed, though,\nthat E\u03b1G1 ;s is certainly not square integrable for general s. The same method\ntreats the lower rank groups as well, though since the statements are not\nneeded here we refer to papers [10] and [58] for Spin(5, 5).\nProof. Recall that the series E\u03b1G1 ;s is a specialization of the minimal parabolic\nEisenstein series E G (\u03bb, g) from (5.3) at \u03bb = 2s\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c1. This is explained in\nour context in [1, Section 2], where Langlands' constant term formula is also\ngiven in Theorem 2.18. The latter shows that the constant term of E G (\u03bb, g)\nalong any maximal parabolic subgroup P is a sum of other minimal parabolic\nEisenstein series on its Levi component. By induction, this is also true if P is\nnot maximal. In particular, since these Eisenstein series on smaller groups\nare orthogonal to all cusp forms on those groups, the constant terms are\ntherefore orthogonal to all cusp forms on the Levi components \u2013 a meaningful\nstatement only, of course, when the parabolic P is not the Borel subgroup\nB (so that the Levi is nontrivial). This means E G (\u03bb, g) has \"zero cuspidal\ncomponent along any such P \" in the sense of [59, Section 3], or equivalently\nthat it is \"concentrated\" on the Borel subgroup B.\nThe constant term along B is explicitly given in terms of a sum over the\nWeyl group:\nZ\nX\nE G (\u03bb, ng) dn =\ne(w\u03bb+\u03c1)(H(g)) M (w, \u03bb) ,\n(7.2)\nN (Z)\\N (R)\n\nw\u2208\u03a9\n\nwhere M (w, \u03bb) is given by the explicit product over roots whose sign is\nflipped by w,\nY\nM (w, \u03bb) =\nc(h\u03bb, \u03b1i) ,\n(7.3)\n\u03b1>0\nw\u03b1 < 0\n\nwith\nc(s) :=\n\n\u03be(s)\n\u03be(s + 1)\n\nand\n\ns\n\n\u03be(s) := \u03c0 \u2212 2 \u0393( 2s ) \u03b6(s)\n\n(7.4)\n\n(see, for example, [1, (2.16)-(2.21)]). This formula is valid for generic \u03bb,\nand develops logarithmic terms at special points via meromorphic continuation. Moreover, certain coefficients M (w, \u03bb) may vanish, for example when\nh\u03bb, \u03b1i = \u22121 and the respective factor in (7.4) has a zero owing to the pole\nof \u03be(s + 1) at s = \u22121 (unless it is canceled by a pole from another factor).\nIndeed, c(s) has a simple zero at s = \u22121, a simple pole at s = 1, and is\nholomorphic at all other integers. Because E G (\u03bb, g) is \"concentrated on B\",\nLanglands' criteria in [59, Section 5] asserts that it is square-integrable if\n\n\f66\n\nM.B. GREEN, S.D. MILLER, AND P. VANHOVE\n\nand only if the surviving exponents w\u03bb have negative inner product with\neach fundamental weight:\nhw\u03bb, \u03c9\u03b1 i < 0\n\nfor each \u03b1 > 0 .\n\n(7.5)\n\nThe rest of the proof involves an explicit calculation to check that for each\n0\npossible value of w\u03bb, either the sum of e(w \u03bb+\u03c1)(H(g)) M (w0 , \u03bb) over all w0 \u2208 \u03a9\nwith w0 \u03bb = w\u03bb vanishes, or instead that (7.5) holds. Actually, despite the\nenormous size of the Weyl groups involved, M (w, \u03bb) vanishes for all but very\nfew w (because of the special nature of \u03bb).\nThough the individual terms in (7.2) are frequently singular at the values\nof \u03bb in question, the overall sum can be calculated explicitly by taking limits.\nWe now present the result of this calculation. To make the condition (7.5)\nmore transparent, we take g = a to be an element of the maximal torus A\n(as we of course may, given that H(g) depends only on the A-component of\ng's Iwasawa decomposition). We then furthermore parameterize a by real\nnumbers r1 , r2 , . . . via the condition that the simple roots on a take the\nvalues\na\u03b11 = er1 , a\u03b12 = er2 , . . . .\n\n(7.6)\n\nFor example, for G = E6 the limiting value of (7.2) as \u03bb approaches 3\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c1\ncan be calculated explicitly as e2r1 +3r2 +4r3 +6r4 +4r5 +2r6 times\n\u0001\n3\u03b6(3) e2r1 +r3 + er5 +2r6 + \u03c0 2 (er2 + er3 + er5 ) + 6\u03c0(r4 + \u03b3 \u2212 log(4\u03c0))\n.\n3\u03b6(3)\n(7.7)\nThe exponentials are all dominated by e\u03c1(H(g)) = e8r1 +11r2 +15r3 +21r4 +15r5 +8r6\nfor ri > 0, that is, (7.5) holds and hence E\u03b1G1 ;3/2 is square-integrable \u2013\nverifying a fact proven in [10].\nWe now turn to the two new cases, those of the s = 5/2 series for E7\nand E8 . We recall the computational method of [1, Section 2.4] to find the\nminimal parabolic constant terms, namely to precompute the set\nS\n\n:= { w \u2208 \u03a9 | w\u03b1i > 0\n\nfor all i 6= 1 } .\n\n(7.8)\n\nFor w \u2208\n/ S, M (w, \u03bb) will include the factor c(h\u03bb, \u03b1i i) = c(h2s\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c1, \u03b1i i) =\nc(\u2212h\u03c1, \u03b1i i) = c(\u22121) = 0 for some i > 1. At the same time, at least for\nRe s < 12 , all inner products h\u03bb, \u03b1i will be negative, and hence none of\nthe other factors in (7.3) can have a pole (after all, c(s) is holomorphic for\nRe s < 0). Thus the term for w in (7.2) vanishes identically in s by analytic\ncontinuation, and the sum in (7.2) reduces to one over w \u2208 S.\nFor E7 there are only 126 elements in S out of the 2,903,040 elements of\nthe full Weyl group \u03a9. It can be calculated that all but three w of these\n126 satisfy Langlands' condition (7.5), and the three that do not have the\n\n\fSMALL REPRESENTATIONS, STRING INSTANTONS, AND FOURIER MODES\n\n67\n\nfollowing expressions for M (w, \u03bb) for s = 5/2 + \u03b5:\nException 1 : c(2(\u000f \u2212 5))c(2\u000f)2 c(2\u000f \u2212 9)c(2\u000f \u2212 8)2 c(2\u000f \u2212 7)2 c(2\u000f \u2212 6)3 \u00d7\n\u00d7 c(2\u000f \u2212 5)3 c(2\u000f \u2212 4)3 c(2\u000f \u2212 3)3 c(2\u000f \u2212 2)3 c(2\u000f \u2212 1)3 \u00d7\n\u00d7 c(2\u000f + 1)2 c(2\u000f + 2)c(2\u000f + 3)c(2\u000f + 4)c(4\u000f \u2212 7) ,\n\nException 2 : c(2\u000f)2 c(2\u000f \u2212 9)c(2\u000f \u2212 8)2 c(2\u000f \u2212 7)2 c(2\u000f \u2212 6)3 c(2\u000f \u2212 5)3 \u00d7\n\u00d7 c(2\u000f \u2212 4)3 c(2\u000f \u2212 3)3 c(2\u000f \u2212 2)3 c(2\u000f \u2212 1)3 c(2\u000f + 1)2 \u00d7\n\u00d7 c(2\u000f + 2)c(2\u000f + 3)c(2\u000f + 4)c(4\u000f \u2212 7) ,\n\nException 3 : c(2(\u000f \u2212 5))c(2\u000f)2 c(2\u000f \u2212 11)c(2\u000f \u2212 9)c(2\u000f \u2212 8)2 c(2\u000f \u2212 7)2 \u00d7\n\u00d7 c(2\u000f \u2212 6)3 c(2\u000f \u2212 5)3 c(2\u000f \u2212 4)3 c(2\u000f \u2212 3)3 c(2\u000f \u2212 2)3 \u00d7\n\n\u00d7 c(2\u000f \u2212 1)3 c(2\u000f + 1)2 c(2\u000f + 2)c(2\u000f + 3)c(2\u000f + 4)c(4\u000f \u2212 7) .\n(7.9)\nEach of these terms is in fact zero by dint of the triple zero from the term\nc(2\u03b5 \u2212 1)3 counterbalancing the double pole from the term c(2\u03b5 + 1)2 at\n\u000f = 0.

Discussion and future problems\nIn this paper we have studied the Fourier modes of the Eisenstein series that define the coefficients of the first two nontrivial interactions in the\nlow energy expansion of the four-graviton amplitude in maximally supersymmetric string theory compactified on Td , and verified they have certain\nexpected features. In particular, we have shown that their non-zero Fourier\ncoefficients contain the expected minimal and next-to-minimal ( 21 -BPS and\n1\n4 -BPS) instanton orbits for any of the symmetry groups, Ed+1 (0 \u2264 d \u2264 7).\nThis extends the analysis of these functions in [1], where the constant terms\nof these functions were shown to reproduce all the expected features of string\nperturbation theory and semi-classical M-theory. Furthermore, in low rank\ncases we were able to present the explicit Fourier coefficients of these functions and show that they have the form expected of BPS-instanton contributions. Indeed, the form of the 21 -BPS contributions match those deduced\nfrom string theory calculations as summarised by (4.10).\nFor high rank cases this involved a detailed analysis of the automorphic\nrepresentations connected to these coefficients. Namely, we explained that\nthey are automorphic realizations of the smallest two types of nontrivial\n\n\f68\n\nM.B. GREEN, S.D. MILLER, AND P. VANHOVE\n\nrepresentations of their ambient Lie groups, and why this property automatically implies the vanishing of a slew of Fourier coefficients \u2013 precisely\nthe Fourier coefficients that the BPS condition ought to force to vanish. We\nfurthermore showed the most interesting cases \u2013 those of the next-to-minimal\nrepresentation for E7 and E8 \u2013 occur in L2 (Ed+1 (Z)\\Ed+1 (R)).\nThis raises some obviously interesting questions, both from the string\ntheory perspective and from the mathematical perspective.\nAn immediately interesting mathematical direction would be the explicit\n(D)\n(D)\ncomputation of the non-zero Fourier modes of E(0,0) and E(1,0) for the high\nrank cases with groups E6 , E7 and E8 , in particular to get finer information\nusing the work of Bhargava and Krutelevich on the integral structure of\nthe character variety orbits. In a different direction, as mentioned in section 3.3.1 it would be of interest to extend the considerations of this paper\nto affine E9 and behind that to hyperbolic extensions.27\nAnother question that is natural to ask in the context of string theory is to\nwhat extent does our analysis generalise to higher order interactions in the\nlow energy expansion, which preserve a smaller fraction of supersymmetry?\nCould there be a role for Eisenstein series with other special values of the\nindex s in the description of such terms? However, the evidence is that such\nhigher order terms involve automorphic functions that are not Eisenstein\n(D)\nseries. For example, E(0,1) (the coefficient of the 18 -BPS \u2202 6 R4 interaction)\nis expected to satisfy a particular inhomogeneous Laplace eigenvalue equation [6]. Although its constant term has, to a large extent, been analysed\nfor the relevant values of D [1], it would be most interesting to analyse the\n(D)\nnon-zero Fourier modes of E(0,1) , which should describe the couplings of 18 BPS instantons in the four-graviton amplitude for low enough dimensions,\nD. This should reveal a rich structure. For example, the instantons that\ncontribute in the limit of decompactification from D to D + 1 include the\n1\n8 -BPS black holes of D + 1 dimensions, which can have non-zero horizon\nsize and exponential degeneracy. It is not apparent at first sight whether\nthis degeneracy should be encoded in the solutions of the inhomogeneous\n(D)\nequation satisfied by E(0,1) . Indeed, we have seen in the 41 -BPS cases that\n(D)\n\nthe Fourier expansion of the coefficient function E(1,0) in the decompactifica-\n\ntion limit does not determine the Hagedorn-like degeneracy of 14 -BPS small\nblack holes in D + 1 dimensions. Rather, the divisor sums weight particular\ncombinations of charges and windings of the wrapped world-lines of such\nobjects.\nThese issues involve mathematical challenges. For example, the study of\ninhomogeneous Laplace equations for the group SL(2, R) heavily relies on\nexplicit formulas for automorphic Green functions, which do not generalize\n27After this paper was first posted on the arXiv the paper [60] by Fleig and Klein-\n\nschmidt appeared, which makes important steps in this direction.\n\n\fSMALL REPRESENTATIONS, STRING INSTANTONS, AND FOURIER MODES\n\n69\n\nin an obvious manner to higher rank groups because they involve automorphic Laplace eigenfunctions which do not have moderate growth in the cusps\n(at present the existence of such functions is itself an open problem).\nAnother issue is to what extent this analysis can be extended to discuss\nthe automorphic properties of yet higher order terms in the expansion of the\nfour-graviton amplitude. Further afield are issues concerning the extension\nof these ideas to multi-particle amplitudes, to amplitudes that transform\nas modular forms of non-zero weight, and extensions to processes with less\nsupersymmetry.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to Jeffrey Adams, Ling Bao, Iosif Bena, Manjul Bhargava, Dan Ciubotaru, Nick Dorey, Howard Garland, David Kazhdan, Axel\nKleinschmidt, Laurent Lafforgue, Peter Littelmann, Dragan Milicic, Andrew Neitzke, Daniel Persson, Boris Pioline, Gerhard R\u00f6hrle, Siddhartha\nSahi, Simon Salamon, Gordan Savin, Wilfried Schmid, Freydoon Shahidi,\nSheer El-Showk, and Peter Trapa for enlightening conversations.\nMBG is grateful for the support of European Research Council Advanced\nGrant No. 247252, and to the Aspen Center for Physics for support under\nNSF grant #1066293.

Trapa\nDepartment of Mathematics\nUniversity of Utah\nSalt Lake City, UT 84112-0090\nciubo@math.utah.edu, ptrapa@math.utah.edu\nThe representations considered in Theorem 2.14 are examples of a wider\nclass of representations which have attracted intense attention in the mathematical literature. The purpose of this appendix is to recall certain results\n(from a purely local point of view) which are especially relevant for the\ndiscussion of Section 5.\nTo begin, let G denote a real reductive group arising as the real points\nof a connected complex algebraic group GC . In [Ar1] and [Ar2], Arthur\nset forth a conjectural description of irreducible (unitary) representations\ncontributing to the automorphic spectrum of G. In many cases, these conjectures could be reduced to a fundamental set of representations attached\nto (integral) \"special unipotent\" parameters. In the real case, Arthur's\nconjectures - and, in particular, the definition of the corresponding special unipotent representations - are made precise and refined in the work\nof Barbasch-Vogan [BV1] and, more completely, in the work of AdamsBarbasch-Vogan [ABV]. The perspective of these references is entirely local. (Of course an extensive literature approaching Arthur's conjectures by\nglobal methods exists and, for classical groups, is summarized in [Ar3].) As\nwe now explain, the representations appearing in Theorem 2.14 are indeed\nspecial unipotent in the sense of Adams-Barbasch-Vogan.\nWrite gC for the Lie algebra of GC and fix a Cartan subalgebra hC arising\nas the Lie algebra of a maximal torus in GC . Write \u03a9 for the Weyl group of\nhC in gC . The classification of connected reductive algebraic groups naturally leads from GC to the Langlands dual G\u2228\nC , a connected reductive complex algebraic group, e.g. [Sp]. Let g\u2228\ndenote\nthe Lie algebra of GC . The\nC\n\u2228\nconstruction of GC includes the definition of a Cartan subalgebra h\u2228\nC which\ncanonically identifies with the linear dual of hC ,\n\u2217\nh\u2228\nC ' (hC ) .\n\n(A.1)\n\nLet N denote the cone of nilpotent elements in gC , and likewise let N \u2228\n\u2228\n\u2228\ndenote the cone of nilpotent elements in g\u2228\nC . Write GC \\N and GC \\N for\nthe corresponding sets of adjoint orbits. These sets are partially ordered by\nthe inclusion of closures. Spaltenstein defined an order-reversing map\n\u2228\nd : G\u2228\nC \\N \u2212\u2192 GC \\N\n\nwith many remarkable properties which were refined in [BV1, Appendix];\nsee Theorem A.4 below.\nExample A.1. Suppose the Dynkin diagram corresponding to gC is simply\nlaced (as is the case for the groups Ed+1 from figure 1 and table 1). Then\n\n\fSMALL REPRESENTATIONS, STRING INSTANTONS, AND FOURIER MODES\n\n71\n\n\u2228\n\u2228\n\u2228\ngC ' g\u2228\nC and GC and GC are isogenous. Thus GC \\N can be identified with\nGC \\N and d can be viewed as an order reversing map from the latter set\nto itself. With this in mind, consider figure 5. The map d interchanges the\ntop three orbits with the bottom three orbits (in an order reversing way, of\ncourse). In particular d applied to the sub-subregular orbit is the next to\nminimal orbit. The complete calculation of d is given in [Ca].\n\u2228\nFix an element O\u2228 of G\u2228\nC \\N . According to the Jacobson-Morozov Theorem, there exists a Lie algebra homomorphism\n\n\u03c6 : sl(2, C) \u2212\u2192 g\u2228\nC\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0 1\nsuch that the image under of \u03c6 of\nlies in O\u2228 and\n0 0\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 0\n\u2217\n\u03c6\n\u2208 h\u2228\nC ' hC ,\n0 \u22121\n\n(A.2)\n\nwith the last isomorphism as in (A.1).\nThe element in (A.2) depends on the choice of \u03c6. Its Weyl group orbit is\nwell-defined however (independent of how \u03c6 is chosen). So define\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 0\n\u2228\n(A.3)\n\u03bb(O ) := (1/2) \u03c6\n\u2208 h\u2217C /\u03a9.\n0 \u22121\nAccording to the Harish-Chandra isomorphism, \u03bb(O\u2228 ) specifies a maximal\nideal Z(O\u2228 ) in the center of the enveloping algebra U (gC ). Recall that\nan irreducible admissible representation of G is said to have infinitesimal\ncharacter \u03bb(O\u2228 ) if its Harish-Chandra module is annihilated by Z(O\u2228 ).\nA result of Dixmier implies that there is a unique primitive ideal I(O\u2228 )\nin U (gC ) which is maximal among all primitive ideals containing Z(O\u2228 ). (A\nprimitive ideal in U (gC ) is, by definition, a two-sided ideal which arises as\nthe annihilator of a simple U (gC ) module.) Given any two-sided ideal I in\nU (gC ), we can consider the associated graded ideal gr(I) with respect to\nthe canonical grading on U (gC ). According to the Poincar\u00e9-Birkhoff-Witt\nTheorem, gr(I) is an ideal in gr(U (gC )) ' S(gC ), the symmetric algebra of\ngC , and hence cuts out a subvariety (the so-called associated variety, AV(I),\nof I) of g\u2217C .\nIt will be convenient to identify gC with g\u2217C (by means of the choice of an\ninvariant form) and view AV(I) as a subvariety of gC . (The choice of form is\nwell-defined up to scalar; since AV(I) is a cone, AV(I) becomes a well-defined\nsubvariety of gC .) A theorem of Joseph [14] and Borho-Brylinski [BoBr1]\n(cf. the short proof in [V2]) implies that if I is primitive, AV(I) is indeed\nthe closure of a single nilpotent orbit of GC .\nTheorem A.4 ([BV1, Corollary A.3]). In the setting of the previous paragraph,\nAV(I(O\u2228 )) = d(O\u2228 ).\n\n\f72\n\nM.B. GREEN, S.D. MILLER, AND P. VANHOVE\n\nExample A.2. Suppose GC is simply laced and make identifications as in\nExample A.1. Suppose O\u2228 is respectively the regular, subregular, or subsubregular, orbit in figure 5. Then AV(I(O\u2228 )) is the closure respectively of\nthe zero, minimal, or next-to-minimal orbit.\nDefinition A.3 (Barbasch-Vogan [BV1]). Fix an orbit O\u2228 as above. Suppose further that O\u2228 is even or, equivalently, that \u03bb(O\u2228 ) is integral. An\nirreducible admissible representation of G is said to be (integral) special\nunipotent attached to O\u2228 if the annihilator of its Harish-Chandra module\nis I(O\u2228 ).\nNote that since I(O\u2228 ) is a maximal primitive ideal, special unipotent\nrepresentations are, in a precise sense, as small as possible.\nTheorem A.5. Suppose G is split and \u03c0 is an irreducible spherical representation with infinitesimal character \u03bb(O\u2228 ) (with notation as in (A.3)).\nSuppose further that O\u2228 is even. Then \u03c0 is special unipotent in the sense of\nDefinition A.3.\nSketch. Chapter 27 in [ABV] defines special unipotent Arthur packets. Roughly\nspeaking, such a packet is parametrized by a rational form of an orbit O\u2228\n\u2228 ( [ABV, Theorem 27.10]). In the case that O \u2228 is even, these\nin G\u2228\nC \\N\npackets are known to consist of representations appearing in Definition A.3\n([ABV, Corollary 27.13]). As a consequence of [ABV, Definition 22.6] (see\nalso the discussion after [ABV, Definition 1.33]), such a packet also contains a (generally nontempered) L-packet. In the case at hand, the special\nunipotent Arthur packet parametrize by O\u2228 contains the L-packet consisting of the spherical representation with infinitesimal character \u03bb(O\u2228 ). This\ncompletes the sketch.\n\u0003\nCorollary A.6. The spherical constituents of the principal series representations V\u03bbdom from section 5 are integral special unipotent attached to\nO\u2228 (Definition A.3) where O\u2228 is, respectively, the regular, subregular, and\nsub-subregular nilpotent orbit (all of which are even). According to Corollary A.4 and Example A.2, the wavefront sets of these representations are,\nrespectively, the zero, minimal, and next to minimal orbits.\nFinally, we remark that since the special unipotent representation of Definition A.3 are predicted by Arthur to appear in spaces of automorphic forms,\nthey should be unitary.\nConjecture A.7. Suppose \u03c0 is integral special unipotent in the sense of\nDefinition A.3. Then \u03c0 is unitary.\nThe representations appearing in Theorem A.5 are known to be unitary\nif GC is classical or of Type G2 . This was proved by purely local methods\nin [V1], [V2], and [B]. For a summary of results obtained by global methods,\nsee [Ar3].\n\n\fSMALL REPRESENTATIONS, STRING INSTANTONS, AND FOURIER MODES\n\n73\n\nFor completeness, we discuss the analogs of these results in the p-adic\ncase. Let F be a p-adic field, with ring of integers O, and finite residue field\nFq . The group G is now the F -points of a connected algebraic group GF\ndefined over F . We assume for simplicity that G is split and of adjoint type.\nLet K be the O-points of GF , a maximal compact open subgroup of G. Let\nI be the inverse image in K under the natural projection K \u2192 GF (Fq ) of a\nBorel subgroup over Fq . The compact open subgroup I is called an Iwahori\nsubgroup.\nThe Iwahori-Hecke algebra H(G, I) is the convolution algebra (with respect to a fixed Haar measure on G) of compactly supported, locally constant, I-biinvariant complex functions on G. It is a Hilbert algebra, in the\nsense of Dixmier, with respect to the trace function f 7\u2192 f (1), and the \u2217operation f \u2217 (g) = f (g \u22121 ), f \u2208 H(G, I). Thus, there is a theory of unitary\nremodules of H(G, I) and an abstract Plancherel formula.\nIf (\u03c0, V ) is a complex smooth G-representation, such that V I 6= 0, the\nalgebra H(G, I) acts on V I via\nZ\nf (x)\u03c0(x)v dx, v \u2208 V I , f \u2208 H(G, I).\n\u03c0(f )v =\nG\n\nTheorem A.8 ([Bo]). The functor V \u2192 V I is an equivalence of categories\nbetween the category of smooth admissible G-representations and finite dimensional H(G, I)-modules\nBorel conjectured that this functor induces a bijective correspondence\nof unitary representations. This conjecture was proved by Barbasch-Moy\n[BM1] (subject to a certain technical assumption which was later removed).\nTheorem A.9 ([BM1]). An irreducible smooth G-representation (\u03c0, V ) is\nunitary if and only if V I is a unitary H(G, I)-module.\nThe algebra H(G, I) contains the finite Hecke algebra H(K, I) of functions\nwhose support is in K. Under the functor \u03b7, K-spherical representations of\nG correspond to spherical H(G, I)-modules, i.e., modules whose restriction\nto H(K, I) contains the trivial representation of H(K, I).\nThe classification of simple H(G, I)-modules is given by Kazhdan-Lusztig\n[KL].\nTheorem A.10 ([KL]). The simple H(G, I)-modules are parameterized by\n\u2228 \u2228\n\u2228\nG\u2228\nC -conjugacy classes of triples (s , e , \u03c8 ), where:\n(i) s\u2228 \u2208 G\u2228\nC is semisimple;\n\u2228\n(ii) e \u2208 N \u2228 such that Ad(s)e = qe;\n(iii) \u03c8 \u2228 is an irreducible representation of Springer type of the group of\ncomponents of the mutual centralizer ZG\u2228C (s\u2228 , e\u2228 ) of s\u2228 and e\u2228 in\nG\u2228\nC.\nLet \u03c0(s\u2228 , e\u2228 , \u03c8 \u2228 ) denote the simple H(G, I)-module parametrized by [(s\u2228 , e\u2228 , \u03c8 \u2228 )].\n\n\f74\n\nM.B. GREEN, S.D. MILLER, AND P. VANHOVE\n\nExample A.4. In the Kazhdan-Lusztig parametrization, the simple spherical H(G, I)-modules correspond to the classes of triples [(s\u2228 , 0, 1)]. Here\ns\u2228 is the Satake parameter of the corresponding irreducible spherical G\u2228\nrepresentation. On the other hand, let O\u2228 be a fixed G\u2228\nC -orbit in N , and\n\u2228)\n\u2228\n\u03bb\n(O\n\u2228\nset sO\u2228 = q 0\nwhere \u03bb0 (O ) is any choice of representative of the element in (A.3). If e\u2228\n(s\u2228 )\n0 belongs to the unique open dense orbit of ZG\u2228\nC\n\u2228\n\u2228\n\u2228\n\u2228\n\u2228\non gq = {x \u2208 gq : Ad(s )x = qx} (in particular e0 \u2208 O ), then the simple H(G, I)-module (and the corresponding irreducible G-representation)\n\u2228\n\u2228\nparametrized by [(s\u2228\nO\u2228 , e0 , \u03c8 )] is tempered.\nThe Iwahori-Hecke algebra has an algebra involution \u03c4 , called the IwahoriMatsumoto involution, defined on the generators as in [IM]. It induces an\ninvolution on the set of simple H(G, I)-modules, which is easily seen to map\nunitary modules to unitary modules. The effect of \u03c4 on the set of KazhdanLusztig parameters is given by a Fourier transform of perverse sheaves [EM],\nand therefore it is hard to compute effectively in general, except in type\nA [MW]. (For a general algorithm, see [L].) However, it is easy to see that\nif \u03c0(s\u2228\nO\u2228 , 0, 1) is a simple spherical H(G, I)-module, then\n\u2228\n\u2228\n\u03c4 (\u03c0(s\u2228\nO\u2228 , 0, 1)) = \u03c0(sO\u2228 , e0 , 1),\n\n(A.11)\n\n\u03c0(s\u2228\nO\u2228 , 0, 1)\n\nwhere the notation is as in Example A.4. In particular,\nis unitary. Together with Theorem A.9, this gives the following corollary (cf. Conjecture A.7).\nCorollary A.12. If \u03c0 is an irreducible spherical G-representation with Sa\u2228\ntake parameter s\u2228\nO\u2228 \u2208 GC , then \u03c0 is unitary.\nReferences\n[ABV]\n\n[Ar1]\n[Ar2]\n[Ar3]\n[B]\n[BV1]\n[BM1]\n[Bo]\n\n[BoBr1]\n\nJ.

This satisfies the anti-commutation relations,\n\u0001\n{Q\u03b1 , Q\u03b2 } = PI1 \u03930 \u0393I1 \u03b1\u03b2 + Z\u03b1\u03b2\n(B.1)\nwhere the central charge is\nZ\u03b1\u03b2 = ZI1 I2 \u03930 \u0393I1 I2\n\n\u0001\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\n+ ZI1 ***I5 \u03930 \u0393I1 ***I5\n\n\u0001\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\n,\n\n(B.2)\n\nwhere \u0393I\u03b1\u03b2 are SO(1, 10) Dirac matrices28 and PI is the eleven-dimensional\ntranslation operator.\nB.1. BPS particle states. Positivity of the anticommutator in (B.1) leads\nto the Bogomol'nyi bound that restricts the masses of states to be larger than\nor equal to the central charge. States saturating the bound are BPS states\nthat form supermultiplets, the lengths of which depend on the fraction of supersymmetry broken by their presence. The shortest multiplets are 21 -BPS,\nwith longer multiplets for smaller fractions. We refer, for instance, to [61\u201363]\nfor extensive discussions of the properties of supersymmetric branes in string\ntheory.\nThe presence of the 2-form component of the central charge indicates\nthat the theory contains a membrane-like state (the M 2-brane) carrying a\n28\u0393I1 ***Ir is the antisymmetrized product of r Gamma matrices normalised so that\n\u03b1\u03b2\n1***r\n\n\u0393\n\n= \u03931 * * * \u0393r .\n\n\f76\n\nM.B.

The 2-form charge couples to a 3-form potential\n(3)\n(CI1 I2 I3 ), with field strength H (4) = dC (3) . This is analogous to the manner\nin which the Maxwell 1-form potential couples to a point-like electric charge\n(a 0-brane), and H (4) is the analogue of the Maxwell field. The analogue of\nthe dual Maxwell-field is a 7-form field-strength, which is required by consistency with supersymmetry to take the form that H (7) = dC (6) +C (3) \u2227dC (3) ,\nwhere C (6) is the 6-form potential that couples to the M 5-brane. In other\nwords, the M 5-brane couples to the magnetic charge that is dual to the\nelectric charge carried by the M 2-brane. The BPS condition implies that\nthe charge on the brane is equal to its tension, T (r) ,\nQ(r) = T (r) .\n\n(B.4)\n\nThe integrals in (B.3) are well-defined when all the spatial directions of the\nbranes are wound around the compact cycles of the M-theory torus, T d+1 ,\nin which case the state is point-like from the point of view of the D = 10 \u2212 d\nnon-compact dimensions (so there are finite-mass point-like states due to\nwrapped M 2-branes when d \u2265 1 as well as wrapped M 5-branes when d \u2265\n4).29 Other kinds of 21 -BPS states also arise in the toroidal background, such\nas point-like Kaluza\u2013Klein (KK) charges, which are modes of the metric\nthat contribute for any d \u2265 0. The magnetic dual of a KK state is a KKM ,\nwhich is described by a Taub-NUT geometry in four spatial dimensions,\nleaving six more spatial dimensions that are interpreted as the directions on\na six-brane. This has a finite mass when wrapped around T 6 , so it can arise\nwhen d \u2265 5.\nThe complete spectrum of BPS states in an arbitrary toroidal compactification of type IIA or IIB string theory can be deduced by considering\nthe toroidal compactification of the M-theory algebra (B.1) with appropriate rescalings of the moduli [64]. Combining completely wrapped branes in\nvarious combinations leads to point-like 21 -, 14 - and 81 -BPS states that are of\nimportance in discussing the spectrum of black holes in string theory [26,27].\nThis spectrum is of significance in classifying the orbits of instantons that\ndecompactify to black hole states in one higher dimension associated with\n29There is a huge literature of far more elaborate windings of such branes around\nsupersymmetric cycles in curved manifolds, in which case a fraction of the supersymmetry\nmay or may not be preserved.\n\n\fSMALL REPRESENTATIONS, STRING INSTANTONS, AND FOURIER MODES\n\n77\n\nthe parabolic subgroup P\u03b1d+1 .

Orbits of BPS instantons in the\ndecompactification limit\nA finite action instanton in D = 10 \u2212 d dimensions corresponds to an\nembedded euclidean world-volume that can be one of three types:\n(a) It has an action that does not depend on rd as rd \u2192 \u221e and so is\nalso an instanton of the (D+1)-dimensional theory \u2013 this contributes\nonly to the constant term in this parabolic and does not appear in\nnon-zero Fourier modes;\n(b) It is a euclidean world-line of a (D + 1)-dimensional point-like BPS\nblack hole with mass MBH , which gives a term suppressed by a factor\nof e\u22122\u03c0 rd MBH in the amplitude in the limit rd /`D+1 \u2192 \u221e;\n(c) It has an action that grows faster than rd /`D+1 so it does not decompactify to give either a particle state or an instanton in D + 1\ndimensions.\nThus, the instantons of type (b) or (c) are the ones that contribute to the\ncharacter variety orbits in limit (i), which is associated with the parabolic\nsubgroup that has Levi factor GL(1) \u00d7 Ed (R) in D = 10 \u2212 d dimensions,\nwhere the duality group is Ed+1 (Z).\nIn order to illustrate this pattern the following subsections summarise the\nspectrum of rd -dependent instantons (i.e., type (b) or (c)) in each dimension\nin the range 3 \u2264 D \u2264 10 (i.e., 0 \u2264 d \u2264 7). Their orbits and the conditions\non the charges corresponding to fractional BPS conditions are summarised\nin table 5 on page 24. Where appropriate we will also comment on the\ndistinction between BPS states in dimension D + 1 and BPS instantons in\ndimension D.\nC.1. BPS orbits in D = 10.\nThis degenerate case includes both 10A and 10B. Although the 10A theory\ndoes have a decompactification limit to 11-dimensional M-theory, it has\nno instantons and there is no duality symmetry group. There are 21 -BPS\nparticle states in 10A consisting of threshold bound states of D0-branes\nthat are manifested as instantons in the D = 9 theory (as we will sketch\nin the next subsection). There is no decompactification limit for the 10B\ntheory. In this case there are no BPS particle states but there is a 21 -BPS\nD-instanton, multiples of which only contribute to amplitudes in the string\nperturbation limit. There are no 41 -BPS particle states in either 10A or 10B.\nC.2. BPS instanton orbits in D = 9.\nThis case may be obtained by considering M-theory on a 2-torus, T 2 , where\nthe discrete duality group SL(2, Z) is identified with the group of large\ndiffeomorphisms of T 2 .\n\n\f78\n\nM.B. GREEN, S.D. MILLER, AND P. VANHOVE\n\nThere is a single type of BPS instanton that can be identified with the\nwrapping of the euclidean world-line of a Kaluza\u2013Klein state formed on one\ncycle around the second cycle of the 2-torus; in this sense we will refer in\nthe following to a euclidean Kaluza\u2013Klein state wrapping a 2-cycle on T 2 .\nEquivalently, this instanton can be described as a wrapped euclidean worldline of a D0-brane of the 10A string theory, which is the parameterisation\nmanifested in (4.24). In this case the unipotent radical consists of 2\u00d72 upper\ntriangular matrices with 1's on the diagonal, and so the one-dimensional 21 BPS orbit is simply\nO1 = GL(1) .\n\n(C.1)\n\nC.3. BPS instanton orbits in D = 8.\nThis case may be obtained by considering M-theory on a 3-torus, T 3 ,\nwhere the discrete duality group is SL(3, Z) \u00d7 SL(2, Z).\nThere is one type of instanton charge from wrapping the world-volume\nof the M 2-brane around the whole of T 3 . In addition there are two types\nof instanton charges from Kaluza\u2013Klein states wrapping the 2-cycles that\ndepend on the decompactification radius r2 (a third Kaluza\u2013Klein state\nwraps the two-cycle that does not depend on r2 ). This gives a total of\n3 types of BPS instanton charges of type (b), which are parameterised in\nthe same manner as the BPS particle states in D = 9 dimensions by a scalar\nv and a SL(2) vector va . The charges of the 12 -BPS states are given by the\ncondition v va = 0 and the 14 -BPS states by v va 6= 0.\nThe 12 -BPS instantons are those for which vva = 0 [24], giving the union\nof the orbits\nfor va = 0 and\n\nO1 = GL(1)\n\n(C.2)\n\nSL(2)\n(C.3)\nR\nfor v = 0, arising from dense open orbits in each of the two factors of the\nduality group SL(2) \u00d7 SL(3). The bold face subscript, in this example and\n1\nin the following, gives the dimensions of the coset, dim( G\nG2 ) = dim(G1 ) \u2212\n1\ndim(G2 ). The 4 -BPS instantons have charges satisfying vva 6= 0, giving the\norbit\nGL(1) \u00d7 SL(2)\nO3 =\n.\n(C.4)\nR\nC.4. BPS instanton orbits in D = 7.\nConsider M-theory on a 4-torus, T 4 , with duality group SL(5, Z).\nThere are 4 BPS types of instanton from euclidean M 2-branes wrapping\n3-cycles, of which 3 depend on the decompactification radius r3 , and 6 types\nof instanton from the Kaluza\u2013Klein states wrapping 2-cycles, of which three\ndepend on r3 .

The 12 -BPS states are given by the condition\n\u000fab vi a vj b = 0 [24] and the 41 -BPS states by \u000fab vi a vj b 6= 0.

BPS instanton orbits in D = 6.\nConsider M-theory on a 5-torus, T 5 , with duality group Spin(5, 5, Z).\nThere are 10 ways of wrapping the M 2-brane world-volume around 3cycles, of which 6 depend on the decompactification radius r4 , and 10 ways\nof wrapping euclidean Kaluza\u2013Klein states on 2-cycles, of which 4 depend\non r4 . This gives a total of 20 BPS instanton types of charge, of which\n10 depend on r4 (and so are of type (b)). These charges correspond to\nthe charges of BPS states in D = 8 dimensions and may be parametrized\nby the rank-2 antisymmetric tensor v[ij] (i, j = 1, . . . , 5) that transforms\nin the 10 of SL(5). The 12 -BPS states are given in [24] by the condition\n\u000fijklm vij vkl = 0 and the 14 -BPS by \u000fijklm vij vkl 6= 0.

BPS instanton orbits in D = 5.\nConsider M-theory on a 6-torus, T 6 , with duality group E6 (Z).\nThere are 20 types of instanton from the M 2-brane world-volume wrapping 3-cycles, of which 10 depend on the decompactification radius, r5 ; 15\ntypes from Kaluza\u2013Klein states wrapping 2-cycles, of which 5 depend on r5 ;\n1 type of instanton from the world-volume of the M 5-brane world-volume\nwrapping the whole of T 6 . This gives a total of 36 BPS instanton charges,\nof which 16 depend on rb and are of type (b).\nThese 16 BPS charges are parameterised by a chiral spinor S \u03b1 (\u03b1 =\nP\nm\n1, . . . , 16) of Spin(5, 5). Such a spinor satisfies the identity 10\nm=1 (S\u0393 S) \u00d7\nm\nm\n(S\u0393 S) = 0, where \u0393 (m = 1, . . . , 10) are Dirac matrices with suppressed\nspinor indices. The configurations are 21 -BPS if S satisfies the pure spinor\ncondition, S\u0393m S = 0 [24]. A standard way to analyse this condition is to\ndecompose S into U (5) representations, 16 = 15 \u2295 5\u0304\u22123 \u2295 \u2212101 (where the\nsubscripts denote the U (1) charges), so it has components\nS = (s, va , v ab ),\n\na, b = 1, . . . , 5 .\n\n(C.9)\n\n\f80\n\nM.B.

The 14 -BPS solution\nis the unconstrained spinor space (excluding S\u0393m S = 0) and has dimension\n16.

BPS instanton orbits in D = 4.\nConsider M-theory on a 7-torus, T 7 , with duality group E7 (Z).\nThere are 35 types of instanton charge from the M 2-brane world-volume\nwrapping 3-cycles, of which 15 depend on the decompactification radius r6 ;\n21 types of instanton charge from Kaluza\u2013Klein states wrapping 2-cycles,\nof which 6 depend on r6 ; 7 types of instanton charge from the M 5-brane\nworld-volume wrapping 6-cycles, of which 6 depend on r6 . This gives a total\nof 63 types of BPS instanton charge, of which 27 depend on r6 .\nThe distinct instanton charges are parameterised by the fundamental representation, q i (i = 1, . . . , 27), of E6 and lead to 21 -, 14 - or 81 -BPS configurations\nP depending on the following conditions on the E6 cubic invariant\nI3 = 1\u2264i,j,k\u226427 (I3 )ijk q i q j q k [24]\n1\n2\n\n\u2212 BP S : I3 = 0,\n\n1\n4\n\n\u2212 BP S : I3 = 0,\n\n1\n8\n\n\u2212 BP S : I3 6= 0 .\n\n\u2202I3\n\u2202 2 I3\n=\n0,\n6= 0 ,\n\u2202q i\n\u2202q i \u2202q j\n\u2202I3\n6= 0 ,\n\u2202q i\n\n(C.12)\n(C.13)\n(C.14)\n\nClearly the first of these conditions (the 18 -BPS condition) is of dimension\n27. The other conditions may be analysed by decomposing the 27 of E6 into\nSO(5, 5) \u00d7 U (1) irreducible representations, 27 = 14 \u2295 10\u22122 \u2295 161 . This\nmeans that q i decomposes as\nq i = (s, vm , S \u03b1 ) ,\n\n(C.15)\n\nwhere s is a scalar, vm is a SO(5, 5) vector of dimension 10 and S \u03b1 is a\nspinor of dimension 16 (the U (1) charges have been suppressed). The cubic\ninvariant I3 decomposes as I3 = 10\u22122 \u2297 10\u22122 \u2297 14 \u2295 161 \u2297 161 \u2297 10\u22122 [24],\nwhich implies that\nI3 = s v * v + (S\u0393S) * v ,\n(C.16)\n\nwhere v * v is the SO(5, 5) (norm)2 of the vector v, and (S\u0393S) * v is the\nSO(5, 5) scalar product between the vector S\u0393m S and v m .\nThe 14 -BPS solution reduces to the condition\ns v * v + (S\u0393S) * v = 0 ,\n\n(C.17)\n\n\fSMALL REPRESENTATIONS, STRING INSTANTONS, AND FOURIER MODES\n\n81\n\nwith non-vanishing derivative with respect to s, vm and Sa . Therefore the\nsolution is given by the 26 dimensional space\n(q i ) 1 \u2212BP S = (\u2212(v * v)\u22121 (S\u0393S) * v, vm , S \u03b1 ) .\n4\n\n(C.18)\n\nThe 12 -BPS condition implies the following conditions\nv * v = 0,\n(S\u0393 S) + s v m = 0 ,\n(S\u0393m )a v m = 0 ,\n\n(C.19)\n(C.20)\n(C.21)\n\nm\n\nwhich are solved by v m = S\u0393m S (using the relation (S\u0393m S)(S\u0393m S) = 0).\nThe 12 -BPS solution is therefore given by the 17-dimensional solution\n(q i ) 1 \u2212BP S = (s, S\u0393m S, Sa ) .\n\n(C.22)\n\n2\n\nTo summarise, in limit (i) the BPS instanton orbits in D = 4 are given\nin [28] by\nE6\n,\nSpin(5, 5) n R16\nE6\n,\n=\nSpin(4, 5) n R16\nGL(1) \u00d7 E6\n=\n.\nF4(4)\n\n1\n2\n\n\u2212 BP S\n\n:\n\nO17 =\n\n1\n4\n\n\u2212 BP S\n\n:\n\nO26\n\n1\n8\n\n\u2212 BP S\n\n:\n\nO27\n\n(C.23)\nand\n\n(C.24)\n(C.25)\n\nThe charges in the 14 -BPS orbit can be generated by applying E6 (Z) transformations to a 2-charge instanton corresponding to a null vector in the\n27 dimensional BPS state space. The charges in the 18 -BPS orbit can be\ngenerated from a 3-charge instanton corresponding to space-like or timelike vectors with I3 6= 0 in the 27 dimensional BPS state space (note that,\nunlike [25] we have included the scale factor GL(1) in the definition of the\norbit, which is of dimension 27). The last orbit of dimension 27 is the 18 -BPS\np\norbit of black hole states with I3 6= 0, and entropy proportional to |I3 |.\nC.8. BPS instanton orbits in D = 3.\nConsider M-theory on an 8-torus T 8 with duality group E8 (Z).\nThere are 56 types of instanton charge from M 2-brane world-volumes\nwrapping 3-cycles, of which 21 depend on the decompactification radius, r7 ;\n28 types of instanton charge from Kaluza\u2013Klein states wrapping 2-cycles,\nof which 7 depend on r7 ; 28 types of instanton charge from M 5-branes\nwrapping 6-cycles, of which 21 depend on r7 . In addition there are 8 types\nof instantons that depend on r7 due to KKM world-volumes wrapping 8cycles, which are distinguished by labelling which cycle corresponds to x#\n(the fibre coordinate in (3.1)). This gives a total of 120 types of instanton\ncharges, of which 57 depend on r7 .\nThe connection with the black hole states in D = 4 dimensions is slightly\nsubtle. For one of the 8 KKM instantons x# is identified with the euclidean\n\n\f82\n\nM.B. GREEN, S.D. MILLER, AND P.

It\nis therefore of type (c) and does not correspond to a black hole state in\nD = 4 dimensions. This accounts for the nonabelian, Heisenberg, entry in\nthe unipotent radical for the parabolic subgroup, GL(1) \u00d7 E7 , of E8 . The\nnonzero Fourier modes in limit (i) correspond to the 56 abelian components\nof the unipotent radical which match the charges of BPS states in D = 4.\nThese are in the fundamental representation, q i (i = 1, . . . , 56), of E7 .

The last orbit of dimension 56 is the 18 -BPS orbit of black\n\u221a\nhole states with I4 > 0, which have entropy proportional to I4 ; it can be\nobtained by acting on a 4-charge system in the 56 representation of E7 as\ndetailed in [28]. We have included the overall scale factor in the definition of\nthe orbit. Another orbit of dimension 56 is (R\u2212 \u00d7 E7 )/E6(2) that has I4 < 0\nand does not correspond to a BPS solution at all [24, 25]. All these charge\norbits can be understood in terms of the superpositions of branes at angles\nand constructed from combinations of (D0, D2, D4, D6) [66].\nNote the presence of the 33-dimensional nonabelian group in the stabilizer\nof O45 . It is a Heisenberg group isomorphic to the unipotent radical of the\nmaximal parabolic subgroup P\u03b11 = L\u03b11 U\u03b11 of E7 . This can be seen directly\n\n\fSMALL REPRESENTATIONS, STRING INSTANTONS, AND FOURIER MODES\n\n83\n\nusing the basepoint of this orbit given in [33, \u00a75.9.8]. Different stabilizer\ngroups of the same dimension have appeared in the physics literature listed.\nAppendix D. Euclidean Dp-brane instantons.\nWe here sketch the background to the analysis of the euclidean Dp-brane\ninstanton configurations that contribute in the perturbative limit of string\ntheory discussed in section 3.4, based on an analysis of supersymmetry conditions on the embeddings of world-sheets on the string theory torus Td .\nContributions from wrapped NS5-brane world-sheets also arise for d = 6, 7\nand KK monopoles for d = 7.\nWrapping a euclidean Dp-brane world-volume of either ten-dimensional\ntype II string theory on a (p+1)-cycle leads to an instanton in the transverse\nR1,8\u2212p space-time. This 21 -BPS condition preserves a linear combination of\nthe supersymmetries that act on the left-moving and right-moving modes\nof a closed superstring. This leads to the following constraint on the supersymmetry parameters,\n\u03b5\u0303 =\n\np+1\nY\n\n\u0393i \u03b5\n\n(D.1)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere \u03b5 and \u03b5\u0303 are chiral sixteen-component SO(1, 9) spinors parameterizing\nthe left- and right-moving super symmetries and \u0393i are the usual SO(1, 9)\nGamma matrices that satisfy the Clifford algebra {\u0393i , \u0393j } = \u22122\u03b7 ij , where\n\u03b7 is the Minkowski metric with signature (\u2212 + * * * +).\nWhen compactifying on a d-torus space-time becomes R1,9\u2212d \u00d7 Td and a\nSO(1, 9) spinor decomposes into a sum of bispinors, \u03b5 = \u03b5\u0302 \u2297 \u03b7, where \u03b5\u0302 is a\nSO(1, 9 \u2212 d) spinor and \u03b7 is a SO(d) spinor. The condition (D.1) becomes\na condition relating \u03b7 and \u03b7\u0303. T-duality transforms\nQ the \u0393 matrices in (D.1)\nby the action of the spin group SO(d, d), R\u22121 i \u0393i R. This, in general,\ntransforms a wrapped Dp-brane into a Dq-brane so that the supersymmetry\nconditions\nq+1\np+1\nY\nY\ni\n\u03b7\u0303 =\n\u0393\u03b7=\n\u0393i \u03b7 ,\n(D.2)\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nQ\ni\nare satisfied. As remarked in [67], this means the two spinors q+1\ni=1 \u0393 \u03b5 and\nQp+1 i\ni=1 \u0393 \u03b5 must be in the same Spin(d, d) orbit.\nA euclidean Dp-brane can be wrapped over cycles of a d-torus of dimension 0 \u2264 p + 1 \u2264 d with p \u2261 0 (mod 2) for type IIA superstring theory\nand p \u2261 1 (mod 2) for type IIB. These instanton configurations\u0001fill out a\nP\nd\nchiral spinor representation, SA , of dimension p\u2261s (mod 2) p+1\n= 2d\u22121 ,\nwith s = 0 or 1, of the T-duality group SO(d, d) . The BPS condition on\nDp-branes wrapping a torus in (D.2) can be interpreted as a condition on\nthe spinor SA . The various brane configurations are then classified by orbits\nof SA under the action of the double cover Spin(d, d) of the T-duality group\n\n\f84\n\nM.B. GREEN, S.D. MILLER, AND P. VANHOVE\n\nSO(d, d). In this manner the spinor parameterizes the commuting set of\ninstanton charges in the perturbative regime.\nFor d = 6 or d = 7 there are also contributions from NS5-branes wrapping\nsix-cycles. Such NS5-brane configurations give contributions to the instanton charges that do not commute with those of the wrapped Dp-branes. In\nother words, the Dp-brane charges in the spinor representation parametrize\nthe u\u22121 component part of the unipotent radical U (the abelian part) for the\nstandard parabolic subgroup P\u03b11 of Ed+1 and the NS5-brane charge are in\nthe derived subgroup [U, U ] component part of the unipotent radical for the\nstandard parabolic subgroup P\u03b11 of Ed+1 in table 3 on page 21. For d = 6\nthis provides one extra charge configuration since there is a unique six-cycle.\nFor d = 7 there are 7 distinct six-cycles so there are 7 NS5-brane charges.\nIn addition there are 7 stringy KKM instantons. Recall that these arise\nfrom Kaluza\u2013Klein monopoles in ten-dimensional string theory in which the\nfibre direction x# is identified with a circle in T7 (whereas the D6-brane is\nseen in M-theory as a KKM formed by identifying x# with the M-theory\ncircle).\nAlthough it is very complicated to describe how all possible compactifications of euclidean Dp-branes fit into different spinor orbits, the following\ndiscussion will indicate the procedure. For this purpose it is convenient\nto start in ten dimensions by defining chiral spinors of the complexified\ngroup, SO(10, C) (complexification does not affect the BPS classification),\nby means of the raising and lowering operators,\n1\nbk+1 = (\u03932k+1 \u2212i\u03932k ) ,\n2\n\n1\nb\u2020k+1 = \u2212 (\u03932k+1 +i\u03932k ) ,\n2\n\n0 \u2264 k \u2264 4 , (D.3)\n\nso that bk = (b\u2020k ) and {bk , bl } = \u03b4kl , and {bk , bl } = {bk , bl } = 0. A ground\nstate | \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\u2212i is defined so that bk | \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\u2212i = 0, for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 5.\nActing with b1 gives the state b1 | \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\u2212i = | + \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\u2212i, with analogous\nstates created by any linear combination of the br 's, giving a total of 25\nstates with + or \u2212 labelling each of the 5 positions. These states are graded\naccording to whether there an even or odd number of + signs. There are\ntherefore two chiral spinor representations of SO(10, C) of dimension 16.\nUpon compactification on Td the spinor \u03b7 in (D.2) is represented as a state\nof the Fock space built by acting with bi on the ground state |\u22125 i. It is\nconvenient to introduce the notation ei1 ***ir := bi1 * * * bir |\u2212d/2 i and e\u2217i1 ***ir :=\nbi1 * * * bir |+d/2 i, which was used in section 3.4.1.\nP\nSpinors that are related by a continuous Spin(d, d) transformation exp( i,j xij \u03b3 ij )\nare associated with D-brane configurations that are equivalent under Tduality. Each orbit listed in section 3.4.1 is characterized by a representative S 0 . Therefore an SO(d, d) pure spinor is equivalent to the ground state\nof the Fock space that we can denote by 1, corresponding to a pure spinor\ndefining a D-brane wrapping a supersymmetric cycle. The notation ei1 ***ir\ncorresponds to a D-brane configuration wrapping the directions {i1 , * * * , ir }\n\n\fSMALL REPRESENTATIONS, STRING INSTANTONS, AND FOURIER MODES\n\n85\n\nin Td and e\u2217i1 ***ir a D-brane configuration wrapping the complementary directions to {i1 , * * * , ir } in Td .\nUpon compactifying on a torus of dimension d \u2264 3, all possible brane\nworld-volumes are parallel, up to identification under Spin(d, d, Z), and the\ncondition (D.1) ensures in this case that all instanton configurations are 21 BPS. These are p = 0 and p = 2 wrappings in type IIA, and p = \u22121 and\np = 1 in type IIB.\nThe theory compactified on a 4-torus T4 in type IIA (for instance), includes instantons due to wrapping D0-brane world-lines on any of the four\n1-cycles and D2-brane world-volumes on any of the four 3-cycles. These configurations in general\nout an eight-dimension\nchiral spinor representation\nPfill\nP4\n4\nabc /3!. This parametrization\na +\nv\nb\nof SO(4, 4), SA =\nv\nb\na,b,c=1 abc\ni=a a\nmakes explicit the action of SL(4) on va or ua = \u000fabcd vabc (or SU (4) in the\ncomplexified case).\nWith a single D0-brane or a single D2-brane world-volume wrapped on T4\nthe condition (D.1) is always satisfied, and the configuration is 12 -BPS. However, wrapping both a D0-brane world-line and a D2-brane world-volume\nresults in further breaking of supersymmetry unless va and ua satisfy condition (D.2). It is easily seen that this condition is satisfied for all \u03b7 = | \u00b1 \u00b1i\nif v * u = 0. But if u * v 6= 0 only \u03b7 = | + \u00b1i satisfy the solution which is\n1\n4 -BPS. These two conditions are invariant under the action of the T-duality\ngroup Spin(4, 4) acting on a spinor SA . The 21 -BPS condition corresponds to\nimposing the pure spinor constraint S * S = 0 while the 14 -BPS corresponds\nto the complementary condition, S * S 6= 0, which defines the configuration\nwith the D0-brane world-line orthogonal to the D2-brane world-volume.\nExtensions of these arguments lead to a classification of all BPS configurations of euclidean Dp-brane world-volumes that are completely wrapped\non a torus. The orbits of such configurations are obtained by imposing\ngeneralisations of the pure spinor constraint on the SO(d, d) spinor that\nparameterizes the orbits. An orbit which preserves a smaller fraction of\nsupersymmetry is larger and is associated with a spinor satisfying weaker\nconstraints. The resulting orbits are described in section 3.4.1.\nAppendix E. Properties of lattice sums\nThis appendix and appendices F and G together concern properties of\nlattice sums related to the Fourier expansions of certain Eisenstein series\nthat appear in the coefficient functions for the cases D = 7 and D = 6\n(i.e., for SL(5) and Spin(5, 5), respectively). Those properties will later be\nused in section 4 and appendices H.2-H.3.

Let g \u2208 GL(d, R) and consider\nthe set of points\n{ mg \u2208 Rd | m \u2208 Zd6=0 } ,\n(E.1)\nwhere m is thought of as a row vector. This set of points is unchanged if g is\nreplaced by \u03b3g for any \u03b3 \u2208 GL(d, Z), so we may assume that g lies in a fixed\nfundamental domain for GL(d, Z)\\GL(d, R). A standard result in reduction\ntheory asserts that every fundamental domain is contained in a Siegel set,\nso we may also assume that g = nak where n is unit upper triangular and\nlies in a fixed compact set, k lies in O(d, R), and a is a diagonal matrix with\npositive diagonal entries a1 , a2 , . . . such that\nq each ai /ai+1 is bounded below\n\n3\n\u22121\nby an absolute constant (to be explicit,\n4 [68]). Therefore a na and\nits inverse range over a fixed compact subset of N , which means that the\noperator norms of both are bounded by a constant that depends only on the\ndimension d. As a consequence kmgk = kmnakk = kmnak = kma * a\u22121 nak\nis bounded above and below by multiples of kmak:\n\nc\u2212 kmak2 \u2264 kmgk2 \u2264 c+ kmak2 ,\n\n(E.2)\n\nwhere the constants c\u2212 and c+ depend only on d.

For completeness (and because the\nmechanism will be used later) we shall briefly sketch her argument. Since\nevery relative prime vector in Zd is the bottom row of a matrix in SL(d, Z),\nx\na\n(2)\nevery element [ vv12 ] \u2208 M2,d (Z) can be factored as [ vv12 ] = [ 0d\u22121 gcd(v2 ) ]\u03b3 for\nsome nonzero vector x \u2208 Zd\u22121 , a \u2208 Z, and \u03b3 \u2208 SL(d, Z), where 0d\u22121 denotes\nthe (d \u2212 1)-dimensional zero vector. Thus\n\u0001 1 a gcd x 0 \u0001 x/ gcd(x) 0\n1\n0\n[ vv12 ]\u03b3 \u22121 =\n[ 0d\u22121 1 ] .\n(E.26)\n0 gcd v2 ( 0 1 )\n0 1\nSince x/ gcd(x) is a relatively prime vector in Zd\u22121 it is the bottom row of\na matrix in SL(d \u2212 1, Z), and so [ vv12 ] can be factored as the product of 2 \u00d7 2\nupper triangular integer matrix with positive diagonal entries, times a 2 \u00d7 d\nmatrix which forms the bottom two rows of a matrix in SL(d, Z). By adding\ninteger multiples of the bottom row of this matrix to the row above it, we\ncan reduce b (mod\n\u0010 gcd(v\n\u0011 2 )) and hence assume that this 2 \u00d7 2 matrix lies in\nd1 b\nthe set S+ := { 0 d2 |d1 , d2 6= 0, 0 \u2264 b < d2 }.\n(2)\n\nWe now claim that the coset space SL(2, Z)\\M2,d (Z) in the sum (E.25)\nis in bijection with products of the form \u03b31 \u03b32 , where \u03b31 \u2208 S+ and \u03b32 are the\nbottom two rows of a fixed set of coset representatives for P\u03b22 (Z)\\SL(d, Z).\nRecall that the latter is the quotient by GL(2, Z) of all possible bottom\ntwo rows of matrices in SL(d, Z). It is a standard result in the theory of\nHecke operators that every right GL(2, Z) translate of an element of S+ is\nleft SL(2, Z) equivalent to some element of S+ (this is because we allow for\nthe possibility that d1 < 0). Thus the previous paragraph shows that every\n(2)\ncoset in SL(2, Z)\\M2,d (Z) has a factorization of this asserted form, and it\nremains to show uniqueness. After right multiplying by matrices in SL(d, Z)\nit suffices to show that if\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010 0 0\u0011\nd1 b\n0\n10\nw1\nd1 b\npq\n]\n(E.27)\n[\n]\n=\n(\n)\n[ 0d\u22122\nw2\nr s\n0 d2\n0 d0\nd\u22122 0 1\n2\n\nd1 , d01\n\nfor some\n6= 0, 0 \u2264 b < d2 , 0 \u2264\n< d02 , ( pr qs ) \u2208 SL(2, Z), and\nw1\n[ w2 ] which are the bottom\u0010two rows\n\u0011 of\n\u0010 one\n\u0011of these coset representatives\nd01 b0\nd1 b\n1\nfor P\u03b22 (Z)\\SL(d, Z), then 0 d2 = 0 d0 , ( pr qs ) = ( 10 01 ), and [ w\nw2 ] =\n0\n\n10\n\nb0\n\n2\n\n[ 0d\u22122\n]. Indeed, (E.27) implies that all but the last two entries of w1 and\nd\u22122 0 1\n1\nw2 vanish, so that [ w\nw2 ] are the bottom two rows of a matrix in P\u03b22 (Z)\n0\n10\nand hence equal to the representative [ 0d\u22122\n] of its equivalence class in\nd\u22122 0 1\n\u0010 0 0\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\nd b\nP\u03b22 \\SL(d, Z). Then (E.27) reduces to the identity d01 db2 = ( pr qs ) 01 d0 .\n2\n\nSince d2 , d02 > 0 and both sides have the same determinant, d1 and d01 have\nthe same sign. Comparing the first columns then shows that r = 0, p = 1,\nand d1 = d01 . Consequently s = 1 and d2 = d02 . Finally, since 0 \u2264 b, b0 < d2\ndiffer by qd2 they must be equal and q = 0. This proves the claim.\n\n\fSMALL REPRESENTATIONS, STRING INSTANTONS, AND FOURIER MODES\n\n91\n\nTherefore the range of summation in (E.25) can be replaced\nby P\u03b22 (Z)\\SL(d, Z),\nP\nat the cost of multiplying the overall expression by d1 ,d2 >0 d2 (d1 d2 )\u2212s =\nP\n\u2212s = \u03b6(s)\u03b6(s \u2212 1). This, along with definition (2.12) and stann>0 \u03c31 (n)n\ndard \u0393-function identities results in the first of the two equivalent formulas\nin (4.57).\nSince the definition (E.15) of I(0, uG) is an integral of a \u03b8-function over\nthe modular fundamental domain, proposition 4.1 indicates that the series\nSL(d)\nE\u03b22 ;s (e) is the Mellin transform of a \u03b8-lift of the constant function.\nAppendix F. Identification of the Spin(d, d) Epstein series with\na lattice sum\nIn this appendix we prove that Langlands' definition of the maximal parSpin(d,d)\nabolic Eisenstein series E\u03b11 ;s\nas a sum over group cosets is equivalent\nto the lattice sum definition used in [51, 52]. It is easier to work directly\nwith the group SO(d, d, R), which is quotient of Spin(d, d, R) by an order\nSpin(d,d)\ntwo subgroup of its center. We explained in (2.13) that E\u03b11 ;s\nis trivial\nSO(d,d)\non this subgroup and hence can be computed through E\u03b11 ;s .\nLet wn denote the anti-diagonal identity matrix obtained by reversing the\ncolumns of the n \u00d7 n identity matrix. Define groups\nG = SO(d, d, R) = { g \u2208 SL(2d, R) | gw2d g t = w2d } ,\n\u0393 = SO(d, d, Z) = SO(d, d, R) \u2229 SL(2d, Z) ,\n\n(F.1)\n\nand\nP\n\n= P \u03b11 =\n\nn\u0010 a\n\n? ?\n0B ?\n0 0 c\n\n\u0011\n\no\n\u2208 G | a, c \u2208 R\u2217 , B \u2208 SO(d \u2212 1, d \u2212 1)(R) .\n(F.2)\n\nProposition F.1. With the above definitions\n(i) If g1 , g2 \u2208 G = SO(d, d, R) have the same bottom row, then there\nexists some p \u2208 P such that g1 = pg2 .\n(ii) The bottom row v of a matrix in G = SO(d, d, R) is orthogonal to\nits reverse w2d v. In particular, if v = [m n] then m \u22a5 wd n.\n(iii) The map from a matrix to its bottom row gives a bijection from\n(\u0393 \u2229 P )\\\u0393 to {v \u2208 Z2d | gcd(v) = 1 and v \u22a5 w2d v}/{\u00b11}.\nProof. Let e1 , . . . , e2d denote the standard basis vectors of R2d . In part (i),\nthe bottom row of the matrix g1 g2\u22121 is e2d g1 g2\u22121 = e2d , as can be seen by\nmultiplying both sides by g2 . Thus g1 g2\u22121 has bottom row e2d ; membership\nof such a matrix in G forces its first column to equal a multiple of e1 , and\nso g1 g2\u22121 lies in P . Statement (ii) is a consequence of the defining property\nof G (since the bottom right entry of w2d is zero).\nBecause of parts (i) and (ii) and the fact that the bottom row of a matrix\nin \u0393 \u2229 P is \u00b1e2d , part (iii) reduces to showing that every such vector v is\n\n\f92\n\nM.B.

Since g can be taken to be a matrix in GL(d, Z) with\nan arbitrary relatively prime bottom row, the proposition reduces to the case\nd\nwhen v has the form v = [m n], where m, n\n\u0001 \u2208 Z and n has the special form\ng\ne\n[0 0 * * * 0 k] (to see this, replace v by v\ng ).

The condition\nthat the bottom row be relatively prime now states that gcd(r, k) = 1. Such\na matrix exists\u0001because of the homomorphism of SL(2, R) into G which sends\na matrix ar kb to one with entries a on the 1st and d-th diagonal entries,\nentries k on the d + 1-st and 2d-th diagonal entries, \u2212b in the (1, d + 1)\nposition, b in the (d, 2d) position, \u2212c in the (d + 1, 1) position, and c in the\n(2d, d) position.\n\u0003\n\u0010\n\u0011\nH H\nProposition F.2. Let h \u2208 SO(d, d, R) and write hht = H1t H23 , where\n2\nH1 , H2 , and H3 are d \u00d7 d matrices. Then the maximal parabolic Eisenstein\nSO(d,d)\nseries E\u03b11 ;s (h) associated to the first node (i.e., \"vector node\") of the Dd\nDynkin diagram is given by\nX\n2 \u03b6(2s) E\u03b1SO(d,d)\n(h)\n=\n(mH1 mt + 2mH2 nt + nH3 nt )\u2212s (F.5)\n1 ;s\nm,n \u2208Zd\nm \u22a5 wd n\n(m,n) 6= (0,0)\n\nfor Re s large (where the sum is absolutely convergent).

The SO(d, d) Epstein series is formed by averaging the function\nf (g) = e2s\u03c91 (H(g)) over g = \u03b3h, \u03b3 \u2208 (\u0393\u2229P )\\\u0393. Recall that f (pgk) = f (g) for\nall p \u2208 P such that each diagonal block a, B, and c in (F.2) has determinant\n\u00b11, and for all k in the maximal compact subgroup of G. Calculation of f\nthus reduces via the Iwasawa decomposition to the case when g is diagonal,\nin which case f (g) equals the \u22122s power of the bottom right entry of g. The\nbottom right entry of the Iwasawa factor of g must be the norm of g's bottom\nrow, because of these invariance properties. Hence f (\u03b3h) is the norm of the\nbottom row of \u03b3h to the \u22122s power. If v = [m n] \u2208 Z2d is the bottom row of\n\u03b3, then the norm is the squareroot of vhht v t = mH1 mt + 2mH2 nt + nH3 nt .\n\n\fSMALL REPRESENTATIONS, STRING INSTANTONS, AND FOURIER MODES\n\n93\n\nSO(d,d)\n\nThus E\u03b11 ;s\nis given by a sum as stated, but with a gcd and modulo \u00b11\ncondition which, when removed, results in the factor 2\u03b6(2s) in (F.5).\n\u0003\nFor later reference we remark that since wd2 = 1 we can present these Dd\nEpstein series as\n2 \u03b6(2s) E\u03b1SO(d,d)\n(h0 ) = 2 \u03b6(2s) E\u03b1SO(d,d)\n(h)\n1 ;s\n1 ;s\nX\n(mH1 mt + 2mH2 wd nt + nwd H3 wd nt )\u2212s (F.6)\n=\nm,n \u2208Zd\nm\u22a5n\n(m,n) 6= (0,0)\n\nfor\n\u0010 Re\u0011s large.

A theta lift between SL(d) and Spin(d, d)\nEisenstein series\nIn proposition 4.1 we stated a relation between the modular integral\nSL(d)\nI(s, G) and the non-Epstein Eisenstein series E\u03b22 ;s . In this section we see\nanother relation (proposition G.1) to the Epstein Eisenstein series E\u03b1D1d;s+d/2\u22121 ,\nwhere Dd is written as a shorthand for statements that apply both to\nSO(d, d) and Spin(d, d). Thus both can be thought of as \u03b8-lifts from the\nusual nonholomorphic SL(2, Z) Eisenstein series. We shall do this for Re s\nlarge, the range of absolute convergence of the Eisenstein series, and then\nmeromorphically continue to s \u2208 C.\nUnfolding the Eisenstein series in (E.15) gives the formula\nZ \u221eZ 1\nd\u03c42\nI(s, G + B) =\nG(\u03c41 + i\u03c42 , G + B) d\u03c41 2\u2212s .\n(G.1)\n\u03c42\n0\n0\nThis integral is absolutely convergent for Re s large by (E.14) and the\nbounds given in (E.7).

This summarises and extends the\nstring theory results in [2] (see [7, 51, 52, 70, 71] for related investigations).\nH.1. The SL(3)\u00d7SL(2) case. The results of this subsection are used in section 4.4 in the text. The coefficients are functions of both the SL(2)/SO(2)\nsymmetric space, which depends on U = U1 + iU2 (the complex structure\nof the 2-torus, T2 ), and the SL(3)/SO(3) space, which depends on 5 parameters. We will parametrise the SL(2)/SO(2) coset by (4.12) (with \u03a9\nreplaced by U) while the SL(3)/SO(3) coset will be parameterised by the\n\n\fSMALL REPRESENTATIONS, STRING INSTANTONS, AND FOURIER MODES\n\n97\n\nstring fluxes as\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n\n1 BNS\n\uf8ed\ne3 = 0\n1\n0\n0\n\nC (2)\n\n\uf8f6\n\n+ \u03a91 BNS\n\uf8f8\n\u03a91\n1\n\n\u2212 13\n\n\u03bd2\n\n0\n1\u221a\n6\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n0\n\n\u03bd2\n\n0\n\n0\n\u03a92\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n1 \uf8f8\n6\n\n(H.1)\n\n\u03bd\n\u221a2\n\u03a92\n\n\u221a\n\u22121\nwhere \u03bd2 2 = r1 r2 /`210 = \u03a92 T2 is the volume of the 2-torus in 10 dimensional Planck units and T2 = r1 r2 /`2s is the volume in string units. The five\nparameters of the coset are packaged into (\u03a9, T, C (2) ), where \u03a9 = \u03a91 + i\u03a92\nand T = T1 + iT2 (where T1 = BNS ). We shall also make use of the combination y8\u22121 = \u03a922 T2 , which is the square of the inverse string coupling. The\ncomplex parameter T is interpreted as the K\u00e4hler structure of T2 .\n(8)\n(8)\nThe coefficient functions E(0,0) and E(1,0) are solutions of (2.6) and (2.7)\nwith D = 8 [2, 48],\n(8)\n\n\u2206(8) E(0,0) = 6\u03c0\n\n(H.2)\n\n10 (8)\n)E\n= 0,\n(H.3)\n3 (1,0)\nwhere the SL(3) \u00d7 SL(2) Laplace operator is defined in terms of the parameters introduced above by\n(\u2206(8) \u2212\n\nSL(2)\n\n\u2206(8) := \u2206SL(3) + 2\u2206U\n\n,\n\n(H.4)\n\n|\u2202BNS \u2212 \u03a9\u2202C (2) |2\n+ 3\u2202\u03bd2 (\u03bd22 \u2202\u03bd2 )\n\u03bd2 \u03a92\n\n(H.5)\n\nwith\n\u2206SL(3) = \u2206\u03a9 +\nand\n\nSL(2)\n\n\u2206Z\n\n= Z22 (\u2202Z2 1 + \u2202Z2 2 ) ,\n\n(H.6)\n\nwhere Z = Z1 + iZ2 and Z = \u03a9 or U.

Fourier modes of the series E\u03b22 ;s .\nOur method of determining the Fourier modes of the non-Epstein SL(5)\nSL(5)\nseries E\u03b23 ;s is based on the integral representation described in proposition 4.1. For computational reasons it is easier to work with the series\nSL(5)\nE\u03b22 ;s , which is related both by the functional equation in (4.57) and the\ncontragredient map g 7\u2192 ge defined in (F.4). Here we shall compute its\nnonzero Fourier modes in each of the four standard maximal parabolic subgroups P\u03b21 , P\u03b22 , P\u03b23 , and P\u03b24 of SL(5); the relevant Fourier modes for\nSL(5)\nE\u03b23 ;s will be derived from this in section 4.5.\nH.2.2.1. The parabolic P\u03b21 = SL(4) \u00d7 GL(1) \u00d7 U\u03b21 .\n\u0001\nIn this case e has the special form I4 Q1 ( e4 e1 ), where Q \u2208 M4,1 (R),\ne1 6= 0, and e4 \u2208 GL(4, R). Note that we do not assume that det e = 1, so\nthat we can later utilize proposition 4.1. The sum (E.8) can be written as\nX\n\u22121\n2\nG(\u03c4, eet ) :=\ne\u2212\u03c0\u03c42 k[p+q\u03c4 , m+n\u03c4 ]ek ,\n(H.38)\npm\n(2)\n[ q n ] \u2208 M2,5 (Z)\n\nwhere p, q \u2208 Z4 and m, n \u2208 Z. For emphasis we have used commas to\nseparate the entries of the row vectors. The exponent is\n\u2212 \u03c0\u03c42\u22121 k(p + q\u03c4 )e4 k2 \u2212 \u03c0\u03c42\u22121 e21 |(p + q\u03c4 )Q + m + n\u03c4 |2 .\n\n(H.39)\n\nThis is independent of Q if both p = q = 0. Hence the nonzero Fourier\ncoefficients of (H.38) come from terms where [ pq ] has rank 1 or 2. We thus\nseparate these contributions and write\nG(\u03c4, eet ) = G1 (\u03c4, eet ) + G2 (\u03c4, eet ) ,\n\n(H.40)\n\n\f104\n\nM.B. GREEN, S.D. MILLER, AND P.

Writing m\u03021 = [m\u030212 m\u030213 m\u030214 m\u030215 ] the argument here is\n(pm\u030212 \u2212 n2 b7 \u2212 n3 b6 \u2212 n4 b5 )q1 + (pm\u030213 + n1 b7 \u2212 n3 b9 \u2212 n4 b8 )q2 + (pm\u030214 +\nn1 b6 + n2 b9 \u2212 n4 b10 )q3 + (pm\u030215 + n1 b5 + n2 b8 + n3 b10 )q4 .
