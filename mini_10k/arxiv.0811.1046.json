In this work we investigate the following isoperimetric problem: to find the regions of prescribed volume with minimal boundary\narea between two parallel horospheres in hyperbolic 3-space (the area of\nthe part of the boundary contained in the horospheres is not included).\nWe reduce the problem to the study of rotationally invariant regions and\nobtain the possible isoperimetric solutions by studying the behaviour of\nthe profile curves of the rotational surfaces with constant mean curvature in the hyperbolic space.\n\n1. Introduction\nGeometric isoperimetric problems, (upper) estimates for the volume of\nregions of a given fixed boundary volume, or the dual problems, play an\nimportant role in Analysis and Geometry. There are both isoperimetric inequalities , common in Analysis, and actual classification of optimal geometric objects, like the round ball in Euclidean Geometry. We will be interested\nin the study of a relative free-boundary isoperimetric problem in Hyperbolic\n3-space between two parallel horospheres. A survey of recent results about\nthe geometric isoperimetric problems is [13].\nFor a Riemannian manifold M n , the classical isoperimetric problem assumes the following formulation: to classify, up to congruency by the isometry group of M, the (compact) regions \u03a9 \u2286 M enclosing a fixed volume that\nhave minimal boundary volume. The relevant concepts of volume involved\nare those of Geometric Measure Theory: regions and their boundaries are\nn-rectifiable (resp. (n \u2212 1)-rectifiable) subsets of M (cf. [11]).\nIf M has boundary, the part of \u2202\u03a9 included in the interior of M will\nbe called the free boundary of \u03a9, the other part will be called the fixed\nboundary. One may specify how the fixed boundary of \u03a9 is included in\nthe computation of the boundary volume functional. In this paper, we will\nassume that the volume of the fixed boundary of \u03a9 is not considered in the\nboundary volume functional. We will see in Section 3 that this implies that\nthe angle of contact between the interior boundary of \u03a9 and \u2202M is \u03c0/2 (when\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

DA SILVA\n\nsuch contact occurs). Such relative problems are related to the geometry\nof stable drops in capillarity problems (the angle of contact depends, as\nmentioned, on how one considers the volume of the fixed boundary in the\ncomputation of the boundary volume functional). For a discussion about\nthat, we refer to [7].\nThe motivation for our work is the well-known result of Athanassenas\n[2] and Vogel [14] which implies that between two parallel planes in the\nEuclidean space R3 , a (stable) soap-bubble touching both walls perpendicularly is a straight cylinder perpendicular to the planes (enclosing a tube),\nand may only exist down to a certain minimal enclosing volume depending\non the distance between the planes. Below that value, only half-spheres\ntouching one of the planes or whole spheres not touching either plane occur,\nthe cylinders becoming unstable. A newer proof can be found in [12], where\nthe authors study the analogous problem in higher-dimensional Euclidean\nspaces.\nIn this paper we study the analogous relative isoperimetric problem between two parallel horospheres in hyperbolic space H3 (\u22121). We will use the\nupper halfspace model R3+ . The parallel horospheres are then represented\nby the horizontal Euclidean 2-planes of R3+ . We will present in this paper a\ndetailed classification of the possible isoperimetric solutions.\nThe existence of isoperimetric regions in the manifold with boundary\n(B, g), the slab composed by the two horospheres and the region between\nthem, may be obtained by adapting a result due to Morgan [11] (B/G is a\ncompact space, where G is the subgroup of the isometry group of H3 (\u22121)\nleaving B invariant, so that Morgan's result applies). Regarding the regularity of the free boundary, well-known results about the lower codimension\nbounds of the singular subset imply that it must be regular, in fact analytic.\nIn Section 2 we give some basic definitions in the model R3+ like geodesics,\ntotally geodesic surfaces, umbilical surfaces and rotational surfaces. We also\ngive a more precise formulation for the isoperimetric problem considered\nusing area and volume functionals.\nIn Section 3 we discuss briefly the rotationally invariance of isoperimetric\nregions and some of their basic geometric properties, since their (free) boundaries must have constant mean curvature and, when touching the bounding\nhorospheres, the contact angle must be \u03c0/2. We will also discuss in more\ndetail the existence of isoperimetric regions and the regularity of the free\nboundary part.\nIn Section 4 we investigate the tangency of profile curves for the rotational\nsurfaces with constant mean curvature to determine the possible isoperimetric regions between the two parallel horospheres in R3+ . We define what we\nmean by catenoid, equidistant and onduloid type surfaces and prove the\nfollowing result.\nLet c1 , c2 be positive real constants, c1 < c2 , and Fc1 ,c2 = {(x, y, z) \u2208\nR3+ : c1 \u2264 z \u2264 c2 }. Let V > 0 and Cc1 ,c2 ,V be the set of \u03a9 \u2282 Fc1 ,c2 with\n\n\fA FREE BOUNDARY ISOPERIMETRIC PROBLEM IN H3\n\n3\n\nT o\nvolume |\u03a9| = V and boundary volume (area) A(\u03a9 Fc1 ,c2 ) < \u221e, where\nwe suppose \u03a9 to be connected, compact, 3-rectifiable in Fc1 ,c2 , having as\nboundary (between the horospheres) an embedded, orientable, 2-rectifiable\nsurface.\nT o\nTheorem 1.1. Let Ac1 ,c2 ,V = inf{A(\u03a9 Fc1 ,c2 ) : \u03a9 \u2208 Cc1 ,c2 ,V }. Then\no\nT\n(1) there exists \u03a9 \u2208 Cc1 ,c2 ,V such that A(\u03a9\nFc1 ,c2 ) = Ac1 ,c2 ,V . As\nalready mentioned, the free boundaries are actually analytic surfaces;\n(2) if \u03a9 has minimal boundary volume, between the horospheres, the free\nboundary of \u03a9, is either\n(a) of catenoid type or umbilical with H = 1, or\n(b) of equidistant type or umbilical with 0 < H < 1, or\n(c) of onduloid type or umbilical with H > 1.\nThe details of the description above are included in Section 4. We observe\nhere that this result shows how the situation in hyperbolic geometry is different from the one in the Euclidean 3-space, where we also have rotationally\ninvariant surfaces of catenoid and of onduloid type, but they cannot appear as boundaries of optimizing tubes (even though, in higher dimensions,\nhypersurfaces generated by onduloids in Euclidean spaces are known to occur as boundaries of optimal tubes connecting two parallel hyperplanes (cf.\n[12])).\nAcknowledgements.

Preliminaries\nIn this section we will introduce some basic facts and notations that will\nappear along the paper.\nLet L4 = (R4 , g) the 4-dimensional Lorentz space endowed with the metric\ng(x, y) = x1 y1 + x2 y2 + x3 y3 \u2212 x4 y4 and the 3-dimensional hyperbolic space\nH3 (\u22121) := {p = (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ) \u2208 L4 : g(p, p) = \u22121, x4 > 0}.\n\nWe use the upper halfspace model R3+ := {(x, y, z) \u2208 R3 ; z > 0} for H3 (\u22121),\ndx2 + dy 2 + dz 2\n.\nendowed with the metric <, >= ds2 =\nz2\nLet \u03c6 : \u03a3 \u2192 R3+ be an isometric immersion of a compact manifold \u03a3\nwith boundary \u2202\u03a3 6= \u2205 and \u0393 be a curve in R3+ . If \u03c6 is a diffeomorphism of\n\u2202\u03a3 onto \u0393, we say that \u0393 is the boundary of \u03c6 and if \u03c6 has constant mean\ncurvature H, we say that \u03a3 is an H-surface with boundary \u0393. We identify\n\u03a3 with its image by \u03c6 and \u2202\u03a3 with the curve \u0393.\nThe plane z = 0 is called the infinity boundary of R3+ and we denote it\nby \u2202\u221e R3+ . The geodesics of R3+ are represented by vertical Euclidean lines\nand half-circles orthogonal to \u2202\u221e R3+ , contained in R3+ . The totally geodesic\n\n\f4\n\nROSA M.B. CHAVES, RENATO H.L. PEDROSA, AND M\u00c1RCIO F. DA SILVA\n\nsurfaces have constant mean curvature H = 0 and are represented by vertical\nEuclidean planes and hemispheres orthogonal to \u2202\u221e R3+ , contained in R3+ .\nThe horizontal Euclidean translations and the rotations around a vertical\ngeodesic are isometries of R3+ . We have two family of isometries associated to\none point p0 \u2208 \u2202\u221e R3+ : the Euclidean homotheties centered in p0 with factor\nk > 0, called hyperbolic translations through a geodesic \u03b1 perpendicular to\n\u2202\u221e R3+ in p0 , and the hyperbolic reflections with respect to a totally geodesic\nsurface P .\nWhen P is a hemisphere orthogonal to \u2202\u221e R3+ centered in p0 and radius\nr > 0, the hyperbolic reflections are Euclidean inversions centered in p0\nthat fix P and, when P is a vertical Euclidean plane, they are Euclidean\nreflections with respect to P .\nThe umbilical surfaces of R3+ are described as follows (see for example\n[8]):\n(1) Totally geodesics: These surfaces were already described (H = 0).\n(2) Geodesic spheres: represented by Euclidean spheres entirely contained in R3+ , they have H > 1 (mean curvature vector points to\nthe interior). If \u03c1 is the hyperbolic radius of a geodesic sphere then\nH = coth \u03c1.\n(3) Horospheres: represented by horizontal Euclidean planes of R3+ and\nEuclidean spheres of R3+ which are tangent to \u2202\u221e R3+ , they have\nH = 1 and the mean curvature vector points upward in the case of\nhorizontal planes and to the interior in the case of spheres.\n(4) Equidistant surfaces: represented by the intersection of R3+ with the\nplanes of R3 that are neither parallel nor perpendicular to the plane\nz = 0 and by (pieces of) Euclidean spheres that are not entirely\ncontained in R3+ and are neither parallel tangent nor perpendicular\nto the plane z = 0. They have 0 < H < 1 and the mean curvature\nvector points to the totally geodesic surface they are equidistant to.\nIn our study, the (spherical) rotational surfaces of R3+ play an important\nrole since the solutions of the isoperimetric problem must be rotationally\ninvariant regions. They are defined as surfaces invariant by a subgroup of\nisometries whose principal orbits are (Euclidean) circles.\nLet \u03a01 and \u03a02 be horospheres represented by distinct parallel horizontal\nEuclidean planes, \u03a0 = \u03a01 \u222a \u03a02 , F = F(\u03a01 , \u03a02 ) the closed slab between\nthem and \u03c6 : \u03a3 \u2192 F an immersion of a compact, connected, embedded\nand orientable C 2 - surface with boundary \u0393 = \u2202\u03a3 and such that \u03c6(\u0393) \u2282 \u03a0\n(we will see later that the image by \u03c6 of the interior of the surface \u03a3 will\nnot be allowed to touch \u03a0 if \u03a3 is the boundary of an optimal domain in\nour variational problem, but this is not part of the general situation at this\npoint).\nWe fix, now, the notation for some well-known geometric invariants related to isometric immersions. We identify (locally) \u03a3 with \u03c6(\u03a3) and X(p) \u2208\nTp \u03a3 with d\u03c6p (X(p)) \u2282 R3+ . We have, as usual, the decomposition Tp (R3+ ) =\n\n\fA FREE BOUNDARY ISOPERIMETRIC PROBLEM IN H3\n\n5\n\nTp (\u03a3) \u2295 Np (\u03a3) into the tangent and normal spaces to \u03a3 in p, respectively.\nChoose an orientation for \u03a3 and let N be the (positive) unitary normal\nfield along the immersion \u03c6. If X(p) \u2208 Tp (R3+ ), we may write X(p) =\nX(p)T + X(p)N = X(p)T + \u03b1N (p), where \u03b1 \u2208 R.\nLet < *, * > be the metric induced on \u03a3 by the immersion \u03c6, making it\nisometric, \u2207 be the Riemannian connection of the ambient space R3+ and \u2207\nthe induced Riemannian connection of \u03a3. Let X, Y \u2208 X(\u03a3) be C \u221e -vector\nfields, then \u2207X Y = (\u2207X Y )T and B(X, Y ) = (\u2207X Y )N are, as usual, the\ninduced connection on \u03a3 and the second fundamental form of the immersion\ngiven by B. We also have the Weingarten operator AN (Y ) = \u2212(\u2207Y N )T so\nthat < AN (X), Y >=< B(X, Y ), N > . Finally, the mean curvature of the\nimmersion \u03c6 is H = 1/2 trace(AN ).\nDefinition 1. A variation of \u03c6 is a smooth map F : (\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb) \u00d7 \u03a3 \u2192 R3+ , such\nthat for all t \u2208 (\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb), \u03c6t : \u03a3 \u2192 R3+ , defined by \u03c6t (p) = F (t, p),\n(a) is an immersion;\n(b) \u03c60 = \u03c6.\nFor p \u2208 \u03a3, X(p) = \u2202\u03c6t (p)/\u2202t|t=0 is the variation vector field of F and\nthe normal variation function of F is given by f (p) =< X(p), N (p) >. We\nsay that the variation F is normal if X is normal to \u03c6 at each point and\nthat F has compact support if X has compact support. For a variation with\ncompact support and small values of t we have that \u03c6t is an immersion of \u03a3\nin R3+ . In this case we define the (variation) area function A : (\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb) \u2192 R\nby\nZ p\nZ\ndet[(d\u03c6t )\u2217 (d\u03c6t )] dA,\ndAt =\nA(t) =\n\u03a3\n\n\u03a3\n\nwhere dA is the element of area of \u03a3. A(t) is the area of \u03a3 with the metric\ninduced by \u03c6t . We also define the (variation) volume function V : (\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb) \u2192\nR by\nZ\nV (t) = \u2212\n\n[0,t]\u00d7\u03a3\n\nF \u2217 d(R3+ ),\n\nwhere d(R3+ ) is the element of volume of R3+ and F \u2217 d(R3+ ) is the pull-back\nof d(R3+ ) by F . V (t) is not, actually, the volume of some region with \u03c6t (\u03a3)\nas boundary, but of a \"tubular neighborhood\" along \u03c6(\u03a3) between \u03c6(\u03a3) and\n\u03c6t (\u03a3). The sign is related to the net change with respect to the normal field\ndefining the orientation (for example, contracting a sphere in R3 , which\nmeans moving it in the direction of the mean curvature vector, gives a\nnegative sign for V (t), as expected).\nDefinition 2. Let F : (\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb) \u00d7 \u03a3 \u2192 R3+ a variation of \u03c6.\n(i) F preserves volume if V (t) = V (0)(= 0), \u2200t \u2208 (\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb);\n(ii) F is admissible if F (\u2202\u03a3) \u2282 \u03a0, \u2200t \u2208 (\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb).\n\nDefinition 3.

If \u03a9 is a (compact) regular region in the slab F between\nthe horospheres \u03a0, taking \u03a3 in Definition 2 as the (embedded regular) free\nboundary of \u03a9, we may extend the above variational approach to produce\na variation \u03a9(t) of \u03a9 by embedded domains (for small t), such that the\ncondition V (t) = 0 in Definition 2 is equivalent to holding the measure\n(volume) |\u03a9(t)| of \u03a9(t) constant (the same as that of \u03a9 = \u03a9(0)) along the\nvariation. This justifies saying that the variation \"preserves volume\" in the\nabove definition.\nWe end this section by stating again our problem. Let \u03a01 and \u03a02 be two\nparallel horospheres in R3 and F = F(\u03a02 , \u03a02 ) the (closed) slab between\nthem.\nIsoperimetric problem for F(\u03a01 , \u03a02 ): fix a volume value and study the\ndomains \u03a9 \u2282 F with the prescribed volume which have minimal free boundary area.\nDefinition 4. A (compact) minimizing region \u03a9 for this problem will be\ncalled an isoperimetric domain or region in F.\nIn more detail, one is looking for the classification and geometric description of isoperimetric regions (as a function of the volume value), in as much\ndetail as possible, aiming at the determination of the isoperimetric profile\n(minimal free boundary area as a function of prescribed volume) for F.\n\n3. First results about the isoperimetric solutions\nOur main goal in this section is to characterize the stationary immersions\naccording to Definition 3.

To show that if \u03c6 is stationary then \u03c6 meets \u03a0 perpendicularly\nalong its boundary \u0393 = \u2202\u03a3, we take an admissible variation \u03a6 that preserves\nvolume with variational field X and p0 \u2208 \u2202\u03a3. Suppose, by contradiction,\nT\n< X(p0 ), \u03bd(p0 ) >6= 0.

Taking the version of Alexandrov's Principle of Reflection for the hyperbolic space (for\nfurther references and details see [1]) and using [6] as reference to take the\nsuitable objects in our case as the reflection planes, we get the next result\n(a detailed proof may be found in [9]).\nTheorem 3.2. Let \u03a3 be a compact connected orientable and embedded Hsurface of class C 2 ,Sbetween two parallel horospheres \u03a01 , \u03a02 in R3+ and with\nboundary \u2202\u03a3 \u2282 \u03a01 \u03a02 (possibly empty). Then \u03a3 is rotationally symmetric\naround an axis perpendicular to \u03a01 and \u03a02 .\n\n\fA FREE BOUNDARY ISOPERIMETRIC PROBLEM IN H3\n\n9\n\nWe observe that the intersection of \u03a3 with a horosphere H (represented\nby a horizontal Euclidean plane) is just an Euclidean circle. In fact, if they\nwere two concentric circles and the isoperimetric region was delimited by\nthese circles we would get a totally geodesic symmetry plane P that would\nnot contain the axis of symmetry.\n4. Isoperimetric regions between horospheres in R3+\nIn this section we classify the rotational H-surfaces of R3+ between two\nparallel horospheres with boundary contained in the horospheres and that\nintersects the horospheres perpendicularly. Therefore we get the possible\nsolutions for the isoperimetric problem in the hyperbolic space since they\nmust be regions delimited by those surfaces.

The other roots s2 , s4 < 0 give us the vertical\ntangency points that point out upward for b > 0 in (4.8). In Figure 1 we have the profile curve for H = 1 and a = \u22120.2 and the\nhorocycles that pass through the vertical tangency. In Figure 2 we\nsee two parallel horospheres and the rotational surface, between the\nhorospheres, that meets them perpendicularly.\n\nFigure\n1.

There exists only\n1\none vertical tangency point corresponding to s = \u2212 .

In the last case it occurs only one\n2\nvertical tangency point and in this case the surface meets only one\nof the horospheres (boundary) perpendicularly. In fact, taking the\nupper Euclidean half sphere that represents the horosphere we get\nthe possible isoperimetric solution for the umbilical case with H = 1.\nIn Figure 3 we see the pair of profile curves for umbilical surfaces with\nH = 1 and the horocycle that pass through the vertical tangency\npoint.

From\n(4.6), if c+ (si ) = c+ (sj ) is a self-intersection then si = \u00b1sj and since\nthe curves are symmetric with respect to cg , the self-intersections\nmust occur on cg . So \u03bb(si ) = \u03bb(s\npj ) = 0. From (4.3) we deduce that\na(1 + a)\nand a minimum point in\n\u03bb(s) has a maximum point in \u2212\n1 + 2a\np\na(1 + a)\n.

As \u03c1\u0307(s2 ) < 0 and \u03bb\u0307(s2 ) > 0, the vertical tangency in s2\npoints out upward. However \u03c1\u0307(s3 ) > 0 and \u03bb\u0307(s3 ) < 0, which implies that the vertical tangency in s3 points out downward. The\nisoperimetric solution is not possible in this case because if the vertical tangencies have not occurred in the same height, then a piece\nof the rotational surface would be out of the region between the\nhorospheres (see Figure 5 and 6).\n\n\fA FREE BOUNDARY ISOPERIMETRIC PROBLEM IN H3\n\nFigure\n5.

We start with the existence an then we\nobtain the possible minimizing regions.\nProof of Theorem 1.1: By Theorem 3.2 , the solutions to the isoperimetric problem have as boundaries rotationally invariant surfaces which have\nconstant mean curvature where they are regular. But they must be regular (actually analytic), since the singularities along such boundaries must\nhave, by well-known results, (Hausdorff) codimension at least 7, which is\nnot possible for (2-dimensional) surfaces. Now, from [10] the existence of\nthe isoperimetric solutions follows from the fact that Fc1 ,c2 /G is compact,\nwhere G is the group of isometries of R3+ whose elements let invariant the\nregion Fc1 ,c2 between the horospheres, that is, the rotations around a vertical geodesic and the horizontal translations. The second part of Theorem\n1.1 follows from the analysis of vertical tangencies done in the First, Second\nand Third Cases above.\n\nReferences\n[1] Alexandrov, A.D., Uniqueness theorems for surfaces in the large, AMS Transl. 21\n(1962).\n[2] Athanassenas, M., A variational problem for constant mean curvature surfaces with\nfree boundary, J.
