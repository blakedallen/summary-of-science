Introduction\nLet K be a field of characteristic 0 and I be a homogeneous ideal of the polynomial\nring R = K[x1 , . . . , xn ]. We denote by \u03b2ij (R/I) and by \u03b2i (R/I) the graded Betti numbers\nand the total Betti numbers of R/I, that is:\n\n\u03b2ij (R/I) = dimK TorR\ni (R/I, K)j\n\nand\n\n\u03b2i (R/I) = dimK TorR\ni (R/I, K)\n\nwhere the subscript j on the right of a graded module denotes, throughout the paper, the\ndegree j component of that module.\nThere are two monomial ideals canonically attached to I: the generic initial ideal\nGin(I) with respect to the revlex order and the lex-segment ideal Lex(I). They play a\nfundamental role in the investigation of many algebraic, homological, combinatorial and\ngeometric properties of the ideal I itself. By definition, the generic initial ideal Gin(I) is\nthe initial ideal of I with respect to the revlex order after performing a generic change of\ncoordinates. The ideal Lex(I) is defined as follows. For every vector space V of forms of\ndegree, say, d one defines Lex(V ) to be the vector space generated by the largest, in the\nlexicographic order, dim V monomials of degree d. For a homogeneous ideal I one sets\nLex(I) = \u2295d Lex(Id ). By the very definition, Lex(I) is simply a graded vector space but\nMacaulay's theorem on Hilbert functions, see for instance [V, Sect.1], says that Lex(I)\nis indeed an ideal. By construction, it is clear that Lex(I) only depends on the Hilbert\nfunction of I. The graded Betti numbers of I, Gin(I) and Lex(I) satisfy the following\ninequalities:\n1\n\n\fTheorem 1.1 (a) \u03b2ij (R/I) \u2264 \u03b2ij (R/ Gin(I)) for all i, j,\n(b) \u03b2ij (R/I) \u2264 \u03b2ij (R/ Lex(I)) for all i, j.\nThe first inequality can be proved by a standard deformation argument and holds,\nmore generally, when Gin(I) is replaced by any initial ideal of I, generic or not. The\nsecond is an important theorem proved in characteristic 0 by Bigatti [B] and Hullett [H]\n(independently) and extended later by Pardue [P2] to positive characteristic.\nIdeals having the same Betti numbers as their generic initial ideal are characterized\nby the following result of Aramova, Herzog and Hibi [AHH, Theorem 1.1]:\nTheorem 1.2 The following conditions are equivalent:\n(a) \u03b2ij (R/I) = \u03b2ij (R/ Gin(I)) for all i, j,\n(b) \u03b21j (R/I) = \u03b21j (R/ Gin(I)) for all j,\n(c) \u03b21 (R/I) = \u03b21 (R/ Gin(I)),\n(d) I is componentwise linear.\nConditions (b) and (c) are not explicitly stated in [AHH] but it follows from the proof\nthat they are indeed equivalent to the others. Similarly, for inequality (b) of Theorem 1.1,\nHerzog and Hibi [HH, Corollary 1.4] proved:\nTheorem 1.3 The following conditions are equivalent:\n(a) \u03b2ij (R/I) = \u03b2ij (R/ Lex(I)) for all i, j,\n(b) \u03b21j (R/I) = \u03b21j (R/ Lex(I)) for all j,\n(c) \u03b21 (R/I) = \u03b21 (R/ Lex(I)),\n(d) I is a Gotzmann ideal.\nRecall that a homogeneous ideal I is said to be componentwise linear if for all k \u2208 N\nthe ideal I<k> generated by the elements of degree k of I has a linear resolution. Also, I\nis said to be a Gotzmann ideal if for every k \u2208 N the space Ik of forms of degree k in I\nhas the smallest possible span in the next degree according to the Macaulay inequality [V,\nThm3.1], i.e., dimK R1 Ik = dimK R1 Lex(Id ).\nBetti numbers can be computed via Koszul homology. Let K(y, R/I) be the graded\nKoszul complex with values in R/I where y = y1 , . . . , yn is a system of generators of the\nmaximal homogeneous ideal of R and let Hi (y, R/I) be its homology. Then\n\u03b2ij (R/I) = dimK Hi (y, R/I)j .\nMore generally, we can consider Koszul homology with respect to a sequence of generic\nlinear forms. We define:\nDefinition 1.4 For p = 1, . . . , n, let K(p, R/I) be the graded Koszul complex with\nrespect to a sequence of p generic linear forms y1 , . . . , yp . Denote by Hi (p, R/I) the i-th\n2\n\n\fhomology of K(p, R/I). These are graded modules. We define the Koszul-Betti numbers\nof R/I by setting\n\u03b2ijp (R/I) = dimK Hi (p, R/I)j .\nWe extend the definition to p = 0 by setting H0 (0, R/I) = R/I and also Hi (p, R/I) = 0\nwhenever i > p.\nWe show in this paper that Theorems 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 hold more generally for KoszulBetti numbers. This is done in Section 4 while Sections 2 and 3 contain some preliminary\nresults.\nIn Section 5 we investigate the properties of the set Gins(I) of all the generic initial\nideals of an ideal I. We show that the Koszul-Betti numbers of the revlex gin, Gin(I),\nare less than or equal to than those of any other gin of I. On the other hand, we exhibit\nexamples of ideals for which in Gins(I) there is no ideal whose Betti numbers are greater\nthan or equal to those of any other element of Gins(I). To construct these examples we\nintroduce the notion of almost Borel-fixed ideals. The main feature of an almost Borelfixed ideal I is that the set Gins(I) can be described in a quite simple way. Then the\nEliahou-Kervaire formula for the Betti numbers of Borel-fixed ideals guides us rapidly to\nthe construction of the examples mentioned above. In Section 6 we list some open questions\nrelated to the results of Sections 4 ad 5.\n\n2. Preliminaries\nIn this section we introduce some definitions, notation and some preliminary facts.\nFor generalities on term orders, Gr\u00f6bner bases, initial ideals and lex-segments we refer the\nreader to [E,BH,G,GS,KR,S,V]. In the following we will consider only term orders \u03c4 such\nthat\nx1 >\u03c4 x2 >\u03c4 . . . >\u03c4 xn .\nBy definition, the \u03b2ijn (R/I)'s are the ordinary graded Betti numbers of R/I. For\ni = 0 one has H0 (p, R/I) = R/I + (y1 , . . . , yp ) and the behavior of its Hilbert function,\nthat is \u03b20jp (R/I), under Gr\u00f6bner deformation has been described in [C]. We proved in [C,\nTheorem 1] that\n\u03b20jp (R/I) \u2264 \u03b20jp (R/ in\u03c4 (I))\nfor all j and p and for all initial ideal in\u03c4 (I) of I. Note also that, since generic linear forms\nare an almost regular sequence (see [AH1]), the modules Hi (p, R/I) have finite length for\nall i > 0 and all p. We start with the following:\nLemma 2.1\n\nLet I, J be homogeneous ideals of R and let \u03c4 be a term order. Then\nR\ndimK TorR\ni (R/I, R/J)j \u2264 dimK Tori (R/ in\u03c4 (I), R/ in\u03c4 (J))j\n\n3\n\n\ffor all i and j.\nThe proof of Lemma 2.1 follows from a standard deformation argument making use of flat\nfamilies, see [E, Chap.15] and [Sb] for details. We will just sketch it. Any vector \u03bb \u2208 Rn+\n\u03b1n\n1\ninduced a graded structure on R and any monomial m = x\u03b1\n1 * * * xn is homogeneous of\nP\n\u03bb-degree \u03bb(m) =\n\u03b1i \u03bbi . For every f \u2208 R one defines its \u03bb-degree to be the the largest\ndegree of a monomial in f . If f \u2208 R is a polynomial of \u03bb-degree a then one defines the\ninitial form in\u03bb (f ) of f with respect to \u03bb to be the sum of the terms of f of \u03bb-degree\nP\nequal to a. Let t be a new variable. If f =\n\u03b3i mi \u2208 R with \u03b3i \u2208 K and mi monomials\nand its \u03bb-degree is a then one defines the \u03bb-homogenization f \u0303 of f to be the polynomial\nP\nf \u0303 =\n\u03b3i mi ta\u2212\u03bb(mi ) . Then for every ideal I of R one defines in\u03bb (I) to be the the ideal of\nR generated by in\u03bb (f ) with f \u2208 I and I \u0303 to be the the ideal of S = R[t] generated by f \u0303\nwith f \u2208 I. By construction one has S/I \u0303 \u2297 S/(t) \u2243 R/ in\u03bb (I) and one can show that S/I \u0303\n \u0303 t \u2243 R/I[t, t\u22121 ].\nis K[t]-free and that (S/I)\nGiven a term order and a finite set of ideals, I and J in our case, one can represent their\ninitial ideals by means of a weight vector in the sense that there exists \u03bb \u2208 Rn+ such that\nin\u03bb (I) = in\u03c4 (I) an in\u03bb (J) = in\u03c4 (J). Let t be a new variable. Let I \u0303 \u2282 S = R[t] and J \u0303 \u2282 S\nbe the \u03bb-homogenization of I and J with respect to t. Consider the bigraded structure on\nS obtained by giving degree (1, \u03bbi ) to xi and degree (0, 1) to t. By construction S/I \u0303 and\n \u0303 S/J).\n \u0303 Let Tij be the direct sum of\nS/J \u0303 are bigraded S-modules and so is Ti = TorSi (S/I,\nall the components of Ti of bidegree (j, k) as k varies. Since Tij is a finitely generated and\ngraded K[t]-module we may decompose it as\nTij = Fij \u2295 Gij\nwhere Fij is the free part and Gij is the torsion part which, being K[t]-graded, is a direct\nsum of modules of the form K[t]/(ta ) for various a > 0. Denote by tij , fij and gij ,\nrespectively, the minimal number of generators of Tij , Fij and Gij as K[t]-modules.\n \u0303 one has a short exact\nSince t is a regular homogeneous element over S, S/I \u0303 and S/J,\nsequence:\n0 \u2192 CoKer \u03c6i \u2192 TorR\ni (R/ in\u03c4 (I), R/ in\u03c4 (J)) \u2192 Ker \u03c6i\u22121 \u2192 0\nwhere \u03c6i is the multiplication by t from Ti to itself. It follows that the dimension of\nTorR\ni (R/ in\u03c4 (I), R/ in\u03c4 (J)) in degree j is given by tij + gi\u22121,j while the dimension of\nR\nTori (R/I, R/J) in degree j is given by fij . Since tij = fij + gij , we are done.\nLet \u2206 : Rn \u2192 Rn and \u03b4 : Rn \u2192 Rn be the linear maps defined by\n\u2206(a) = (a1 , a1 + a2 , . . . , a1 + a2 + . . . + an ),\n4\n\n\f\u03b4(a) = (a1 \u2212 a2 , a2 \u2212 a3 , . . . , an\u22121 \u2212 an , an ).\nFix an integer d and let Md the set of the monomials of degree d in R. The Borel\norder is on Md defined as follows. Let xa and xb be monomials in Md with exponents\na = (a1 , . . . , an ) and b = (b1 , . . . , bn ) then\nxa \u2265Borel xb iff \u2206(a) \u2265 \u2206(b) componentwise\nThe following is a well-known fact:\nLemma 2.2 1) The Borel order is a partial order on Md .\n2) Let xa and xb monomials of degree d. Then xa >Borel xb iff xa >\u03c4 xb for all term orders\n\u03c4.\nThe proof of 1) is easy. To prove 2) one notes that any term order on Md can be\nrepresented by a weight function w = (w1 , . . . , wn ) \u2208 Rn . But wi > wi+1 since we\nconsider only term orders with xi > xi+1 . Then the desired statement follows immediately\nfrom the following identity. Let a, w \u2208 Rn then\na * w = \u2206(a) * \u03b4(w)\nwhere * denotes the ordinary scalar product.\nA subset A of a poset P is said to be an (upper) poset ideal if for all a \u2208 A and every\nb \u2208 P with b > a one has b \u2208 A.\nAny g = (gij ) \u2208 GLn (K) acts on R as a K-algebra graded isomorphism by\ng(xi ) =\n\nn\nX\n\ngji xj .\n\nj=1\n\nAn ideal I is said to be Borel-fixed if it is invariant under the action of any upper triangular\nmatrix. A monomial ideal I is said to be strongly stable if whenever xi m is in I for some\nmonomial m and some i then xj m is in I for all j < i. Equivalently, I is strongly stable iff\nfor every d the set of the monomials of degree d in I form a poset ideal of Md with respect\nto the Borel order. It turns out that the strongly stable monomial ideals are exactly the\nBorel-fixed ideals (in positive characteristic this is no longer the case).\nFor any homogeneous ideal I and any term order \u03c4 one can consider the generic initial\nideal Gin\u03c4 (I) of I with respect to \u03c4 , defined as in\u03c4 (g(I)) where g is a generic element in\nGLn (K). One has:\nLemma 2.3 Let I be a homogeneous ideal and \u03c4 and \u03c3 be term orders.\n1) Gin\u03c4 (I) is a Borel-fixed ideal.\n5\n\n\f2) Gin\u03c4 (I) = I iff I is Borel-fixed.\n3) Gin\u03c3 (Gin\u03c4 (I)) = Gin\u03c4 (I).\nProof: 1) is proved, for instance, in [E, Chap.15]. 3) follows from 1) and 2). One direction\nof implication 2) follows from 1). It remains to prove that Gin\u03c4 (I) = I for any Borel-fixed\nideal I. We recall that a generic matrix g has an LU decomposition, that is, it factors as\na product g = ab where b is upper triangular and a is lower triangular. One can even take\none of the two matrices with 1's on the diagonal but we do not mind. This is a well-known\ntheorem in matrix theory and a proof of it with a description of the precise conditions that\ng must satisfy for having such a decomposition can be found for instance in [GV, Theorem\n3.2.1]. For every lower triangular matrix a and every monomial m one has\na(m) = \u03bbm + . . . monomials which are <Borel m.\n\n(1)\n\nIt follows that for every polynomial f one has in\u03c4 (a(f )) = in\u03c4 (f ) and hence in\u03c4 (a(J)) =\nin\u03c4 (J) for every ideal J. Summing up,\nGin\u03c4 (I) = in\u03c4 (g(I)) = in\u03c4 (ab(I)) = in\u03c4 (a(I)) = in\u03c4 (I) = I\nwhere the third equality holds since b(I) = I by assumption and the last holds since I is\na monomial ideal.\nLemma 2.4 Let I be a Borel-fixed ideal and let m1 , . . . , mk be its monomial generators.\nLet g \u2208 GLn (K) be a generic matrix. Then g(I) is generated by polynomials f1 , . . . , fk\nof the form fi = mi + hi such that the monomials in hi are smaller than mi in the Borel\norder. The polynomials f1 , . . . , fk form a Gr\u00f6bner basis of g(I) with respect to any term\norder.\nProof: As noted already in the proof of 2.3 we may write g = ab with where b is upper\ntriangular and a is lower triangular. Then g(I) = ab(I) = a(I) = (a(m1 ), . . . , a(mk )). Set\nfi = \u03bb\u22121\ni a(mi ) where \u03bbi is the leading coefficient of a(mi ). By (1) we know that the fi\nhave the desired structure and the rest follows from Lemma 2.2.\nProper sequences will be of importance in the next sections. Let us recall the definition\nfrom [HSV, Definition 2.1, Remark 2.4]:\nDefinition 2.5 Let z1 , . . . , zk be a sequence of homogeneous elements in R and let M be\na graded R-module. Set I = (z1 , . . . , zk ). We say that z1 , . . . , zk is a proper M -sequence\nif one of the following equivalent conditions hold:\n1) zj+1 Hi (z1 , . . . , zj , M ) = 0 for j = 1, . . . , k \u2212 1 and i > 0.\n2) IHi (z1 , . . . , zj , M ) = 0 for j = 1, . . . , k and for i > 0.\n6\n\n\fLet z1 , . . . , zk be a proper M -sequence of linear forms. Then the long exact sequence\nof Koszul homologies (see [BH, Corollary 1.6.13]) splits into shorter ones. Denote by Zj\nthe sequence z1 , . . . , zj . For all i \u2265 2 and all j \u2265 1 one has:\n0 \u2192 Hi (Zj , M ) \u2192 Hi (Zj+1 , M ) \u2192 Hi\u22121 (Zj , M )(\u22121) \u2192 0\n\n(2)\n\nand\n\u2022\n0 \u2192 H1 (Zj , M ) \u2192 H1 (Zj+1 , M ) \u2192 H0 (Zj , M )(\u22121) \u2212\u2192\nH0 (Zj , M ) \u2192 H0 (Zj+1 , M ) \u2192 0\n(3)\n\u2022\nwhere the map \u2212\u2192 is the multiplication by zj+1 (up to sign).\n\n3. Koszul-Betti numbers and Borel-fixed ideals\nFirst of all, we explain why the last p variables are \"generic\" for a Borel-fixed ideal.\nLemma 3.1 Let I be a Borel-fixed ideal. For a given p, 1 \u2264 p \u2264 n, let Xp be the\nsequence xn\u2212p+1 , xn\u2212p+2 , . . . , xn . Then \u03b2ijp (R/I) = dimK Hi (Xp , R/I)j .\nProof: Let y = y1 , . . . , yp be a sequence of p generic linear forms. We can choose an uppertriangular matrix g such that the induced K-algebra graded isomorphism g : R \u2192 R maps\nthe linear space generated by yi to the linear space generated by Xp . Then Hi (y, R/I) =\nHi (Xp , R/g(I)) and g(I) = I by assumption.\nFor a Borel-fixed ideal I a formula for the Koszul-Betti numbers of R/I has been\ndescribed by Aramova and Herzog [AH, Proposition 2.1]. Their result holds more generally\nfor a stable ideal and can be seen as an extension of the Eliahou-Kervaire [EK] formula\nfor the Betti numbers. To state their formula in the form which best suits our needs we\nintroduce a useful piece of notation. For a monomial u with exponent a = (a1 , . . . , an ) one\ndefines\nmax(u) = max{i : ai > 0}.\nFor a set of monomials A and for i = 1, . . . , n we put:\nmi (A) = |{u \u2208 A : max(u) = i}|\nm\u2264i (A) = |{u \u2208 A : max(u) \u2264 i}|\nmij (A) = |{u \u2208 A : max(u) = i and deg(u) = j}|\nWhen I is either a vector space generated by monomials of the same degree or a monomial\nideal, we set\nmi (I) = mi (G),\n\nm\u2264i (I) = m\u2264i (G),\n7\n\nmij (I) = mij (G)\n\n\fwhere G is the set of the minimal monomial (vector space or ideal) generators of I.\nTaking into consideration Lemma 3.1, the result of Aramova and Herzog [AH] can be\nstated as follows:\nTheorem 3.2 (Aramova-Herzog) Let I be a Borel-fixed ideal. Then for all i > 0 and for\nall j and p the Koszul-Betti numbers of R/I are given by the formula:\nn\nX\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\ns+p\u2212n\u22121\n\u03b2ijp (R/I) =\nms,j\u2212i+1 (I)\ni\u22121\ns=i+n\u2212p\nWith p = n one gets the Eliahou-Kervaire formula for Betti numbers:\nTheorem 3.3 (Eliahou-Kervaire) Let I be a Borel-fixed ideal. Then for all i > 0 and\nfor all j the Betti numbers of R/I are given by the formula:\nn\nX\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\ns\u22121\n\u03b2ij (R/I) =\nms,j\u2212i+1 (I)\ni\u22121\ns=i\nWe have also:\nLemma 3.4\n\nLet I be a Borel-fixed ideal. Then for all j and p one has:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nn\u2212p\u22121+j\n\u2212 m\u2264n\u2212p (Ij )\n\u03b20jp (R/I) =\nn\u2212p\u22121\n\nProof: This follows immediately from the definition of m\u2264i since, by Lemma 3.1, the\nsequence xn\u2212p+1 , xn\u2212p+2 , . . . , xn is generic for I.\nThe following is a useful property of Borel-fixed spaces, see [B,Proposition 1.3].\nProposition 3.5 Let B be a Borel-fixed vector space of monomials of degree d. Then\none has mi (R1 B) = m\u2264i (B).\nThe functions mi and m\u2264i are important for comparing Borel-fixed ideals. Here is\nwhy:\nProposition 3.6 Let I, J be Borel-fixed ideals with the same Hilbert function. Assume\nthat m\u2264i (Jj ) \u2264 m\u2264i (Ij ) for all i and j. Then one has:\ni) mi (I) \u2264 mi (J) for all i.\nii) \u03b2ijp (R/I) \u2264 \u03b2ijp (R/J) for all i, j, p.\nProof: i) Let k be an integer such that both I and J are generated in degree \u2264 k. The\nideals I<k> and J<k> are Borel-fixed generated in degree k and have the same Hilbert\n8\n\n\ffunction. By the Eliahou-Kervaire formula, they both have a linear resolution. It follows\nthat the Betti numbers of I<k> and J<k> are the same. Again by the Eliahou-Kervaire\nformula it follows that mi (Ik ) = mi (Jk ) for all i and hence m\u2264i (Ik ) = m\u2264i (Jk ) for all\nPk\ni. Now note that we have mi (I) = j=1 mij (I) and mij (I) = mi (Ij ) \u2212 mi (R1 Ij\u22121 ). We\nmay write mi (Ij ) = m\u2264i (Ij ) \u2212 m\u2264i\u22121 (Ij ) and by 3.5 we have mi (R1 Ij\u22121 ) = m\u2264i (Ij\u22121 ).\nSumming up, we have\nmi (I) =\n\nk\nX\n\n[m\u2264i (Ij ) \u2212 m\u2264i\u22121 (Ij ) \u2212 m\u2264i (Ij\u22121 )] = m\u2264i (Ik ) \u2212\n\nj=1\n\nk\nX\n\nm\u2264i\u22121 (Ij )\n\nj=1\n\nThe same formula holds also when we replace I with J. Since we know that m\u2264i (Ik ) =\nm\u2264i (Jk ), it follows that\nX\nmi (J) \u2212 mi (I) =\n[m\u2264i\u22121 (Ij ) \u2212 m\u2264i\u22121 (Jj )]\nj\u22651\n\nBy assumption m\u2264i\u22121 (Ij ) \u2212 m\u2264i\u22121 (Jj ) is non-negative and hence we may conclude that\nmi (J) \u2265 mi (I).\nii) By virtue of Lemma 3.4, for i = 0 one has\n\u03b20jp (R/J) \u2212 \u03b20jp (R/I) = m\u2264n\u2212p (Ij ) \u2212 m\u2264n\u2212p (Jj ).\nThen \u03b20jp (R/I) \u2264 \u03b20jp (R/J) follows from the assumption. To prove the inequality\nfor i > 0 we just follows Bigatti's proof of Theorem 1.1 (b) by replacing the EliahouKervaire formula with the Aramova-Herzog formula. For reader's convenience we reproduce it. First, by 3.5, in the Aramova-Herzog formula we may replace ms,j\u2212i+1 (I)\nwith ms (Ij\u2212i+1 ) \u2212 m\u2264s (Ij\u2212i ). Then we may replace ms (Ij\u2212i+1 ) with m\u2264s (Ij\u2212i+1 ) \u2212\nm\u2264s\u22121 (Ij\u2212i+1 ). We get\nn\nX\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\ns+p\u2212n\u22121\n[m\u2264s (Ij\u2212i+1 ) \u2212 m\u2264s\u22121 (Ij\u2212i+1 ) \u2212 m\u2264s (Ij\u2212i )]\n\u03b2ijp (R/I) =\ni\u22121\ns=i+n\u2212p\nwhich we can rewrite as a sum of three terms:\n\u0013\n\u0012\np\u22121\n\u2212 m\u2264n\u2212p+i\u22121 (Ij\u2212i+1 )\nm\u2264n (Ij\u2212i+1 )\ni\u22121\nn\u22121\nX\n\ns=i+n\u2212p\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0014\u0012\ns+p\u2212n\ns+p\u2212n\u22121\n\u2212\nm\u2264s (Ij\u2212i+1 )\ni\u22121\ni\u22121\nn\nX\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\ns+p\u2212n\u22121\n.\n\u2212\nm\u2264s (Ij\u2212i )\ni\u22121\ns=i+n\u2212p\n9\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n\fNote that m\u2264n (Ij\u2212i+1 ) = dimK (Ij\u2212i+1 ) and hence (i) can be rewritten as\n\u0013\np\u22121\n\u2212 m\u2264n\u2212p+i\u22121 (Ij\u2212i+1 ).\ndimK (Ij\u2212i+1 )\ni\u22121\n\u0012\n\n(iv)\n\nAlso, applying Pascal's triangle formula, part (ii) is equal to\nn\u22121\nX\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\ns+p\u2212n\u22121\n.\n\u2212\nm\u2264s (Ij\u2212i+1 )\ni\n\u2212\n2\ns=i+n\u2212p\n\n(v)\n\nSumming up, \u03b2ijp (R/I) is the sum of (iii), (iv) and (v). The crucial consequence is that\n\u0001\n\u03b2ijp (R/I) can be written as dimK (Ij\u2212i+1 ) p\u22121\ni\u22121 minus a linear combination with nonnegative coefficients of m\u2264a (Ib ) for various a and b. Since dimK (Ij\u2212i+1 ) = dimK (Jj\u2212i+1 ),\nit follows that \u03b2ijp (R/J) \u2212 \u03b2ijp (R/I) can be written as a linear combination with nonnegative coefficients of m\u2264a (Ib ) \u2212 m\u2264a (Jb ). By assumption the latter is non-negative and\nwe conclude that \u03b2ijp (R/J) \u2212 \u03b2ijp (R/I) \u2265 0.\nProposition 3.7 Let I, J be Borel-fixed ideals with the same Hilbert function. Assume\nthat m\u2264i (Jj ) \u2264 m\u2264i (Ij ) for all i and j. Then the following conditions are equivalent:\ni) \u03b2ijp (R/I) = \u03b2ijp (R/J) for all i, j and p,\nii) \u03b2ij (R/I) = \u03b2ij (R/J) for all i and j,\niii) \u03b21j (R/I) = \u03b21j (R/J) for all j,\niv) \u03b21 (R/I) = \u03b21 (R/J),\nv) mij (I) = mij (J) for all i, j.\nvi) mi (I) = mi (J) for all i.\nvii) mi (Ij ) = mi (Jj ) for all i and j.\nviii) m\u2264i (Ij ) = m\u2264i (Jj ) for all i and j.\nProof: The implications i) \u21d2 ii) \u21d2 iii) \u21d2 iv) and v) \u21d2 vi) are obvious. That i) \u21d4 viii)\nand vi) \u21d4 viii) follows the proof of 3.6 while iv) \u21d2 vi) follows from 3.6 since \u03b21 (R/I) =\nP\nmi (I). Furthermore vii) \u21d4 viii) is easy and vii), viii) \u21d2 v) since, by 3.5, we have\nmij (I) = mi (Ij ) \u2212 mi (R1 Ij\u22121 ) = mi (Ij ) \u2212 m\u2264i (Ij\u22121 ).\n\n4. Koszul-Betti numbers, Gin and Lex\nIn this section we prove the main results of this note. To compare Betti numbers of Borelfixed and lex-segment ideals Bigatti made a study of the behavior of the functions mi (. . .)\nas one compares a Borel-fixed space with its lex-segment. She proved in [B, Theorem 2.1]\n10\n\n\fthe following crucial inequality. An essentially equivalent form of the same result appears\nalso in D.Bayer Ph.D. Thesis [Ba, Lemma 8.1].\nProposition 4.1 Let I be a Borel-fixed ideal and let L = Lex(I) be the corresponding\nlex-segment. Then one has m\u2264i (Lj ) \u2264 m\u2264i (Ij ) for all i and j.\nThis is the generalization of Theorem 1.1:\nTheorem 4.2 Let \u03c4 be any term order and I an homogeneous ideal, then\na) \u03b2ijp (R/I) \u2264 \u03b2ijp (R/ Gin\u03c4 (I)) for all i, j, p.\nb) \u03b2ijp (R/I) \u2264 \u03b2ijp (R/ Lex(I)) for all i, j, p.\nProof: Let y = y1 , . . . , yp be a sequence of generic linear forms. Let g \u2208 GLn (K) such that\nthe induced K-algebra graded isomorphism g : R \u2192 R maps yi to xn\u2212p+i for i = 1, . . . , p.\nDenote by Xp the sequence xn\u2212p+1 , xn\u2212p+2 , . . . , xn . Then\nHi (y, R/I) = Hi (Xp , R/g(I)) = TorR\ni (R/g(I), R/(Xp)).\nIt follows by Lemma 2.1:\n\u03b2ijp (R/I) \u2264 dimK TorR\ni (R/ in\u03c4 (g(I)), R/(Xp))j = dimK Hi (Xp , R/ in\u03c4 (g(I))j .\nSince the yi are generic, g can be chosen generic as well. So in\u03c4 (g(I)) = Gin\u03c4 (I) and it is\nBorel-fixed. But then by Lemma 3.1 we know that\n\u03b2ijp (R/ Gin\u03c4 (I)) = Hi (Xp , R/ Gin\u03c4 (I))j\nand this proves a).\nTo prove b), by virtue of a), we may replace I with its gin, that is, we may assume\nthat I is Borel-fixed. Then the result follows from 3.6 and 4.1.\nRemark 4.3 a) Theorem 4.2 a) holds also in positive characteristic.\nb) It is easy to see that \u03b20jp (R/I) = \u03b20jp (R/ Gin(I)) for all j and p, see [C,Lemma 2] for\ndetails.\nNow we generalize Theorem 1.2:\nTheorem 4.4 The following conditions are equivalent:\ni) \u03b2ijp (R/I) = \u03b2ijp (R/ Gin(I)) for all i, j, p.\nii) \u03b21jn (R/I) = \u03b21jn (R/ Gin(I)) for all j.\niii) I is a componentwise linear ideal.\niv) a generic sequence of linear forms y1 , . . . , yn is a proper sequence over R/I.\nProof: i) \u21d2 ii) is obvious and ii) \u21d2 iii) holds by Theorem 1.2.\n11\n\n\fWe prove now that iii) \u21d2 iv). Assuming that I is componentwise linear we have to\nshow that m Hi (p, R/I) = 0 for all i > 0 and p where m denotes the homogeneous maximal\nideal of R. First note that if I is generated in a single degree, say d, then so does Gin(I).\nThen by Theorem 3.2 we have that for i > 0 the homology module Hi (p, R/ Gin(I)) is\nconcentrated in a single degree, namely d + i \u2212 1. By Theorem 4.2 the same is true also\nfor Hi (p, R/I) and hence m Hi (p, R/I) = 0. Now assume that I is possibly generated\nin distinct degrees. For a fixed p, let K\u2022 = K(p, R) the Koszul complex of p generic\nlinear forms and let \u03c6i be the map from Ki to Ki\u22121 . Let a \u2208 Hi (p, R/I) a homogeneous\nelement, say of degree s. Consider its preimage, say, a = f \u0304 with f \u2208 Ki . Then \u03c6i (f )\nis in IKi\u22121 . Since \u03c6i (f ) is homogeneous of degree s, we deduce that \u03c6i (f ) is in Ik Ki\u22121\nwhere k = s \u2212 i + 1. Set J = I<k> , that is J is the ideal generated by Ik . We have that\nthe class of f is in Hi (p, R/J). By construction J is generated in a single degree and by\nassumption it has a linear resolution. From what we have seen above we may conclude\nthat m f is contained in Image \u03c6i+1 + JKi . Since J \u2282 I we have that m f is contained in\nImage \u03c6i+1 + IKi which in turns imply that m a = 0 in Hi (p, R/I).\nIt remains to prove that iv) implies i). We have mentioned already in Remark 4.3 that\n\u03b20jp (R/I) = \u03b20jp (R/ Gin(I)) for all j and p holds for any ideal I. Assuming iv), it is then\nsufficient to show that the numbers \u03b2ijp (R/I) only depend on the numbers \u03b20jp (R/I). For\ni = 1 the exact sequence (2) implies that:\n\u03b21jp (R/I) = \u03b21jp\u22121 (R/I) + \u03b20j\u22121p\u22121 (R/I) \u2212 \u03b20jp\u22121 (R/I) + \u03b20jp (R/I)\nFor i > 1 the exact sequence (3) implies:\n\u03b2ijp (R/I) = \u03b2ijp\u22121 (R/I) + \u03b2i\u22121j\u22121p\u22121 (R/I)\nSince \u03b2ijp (R/I) = 0 for all i > p these recursive relations imply what we want and\nconclude the proof.\nNow we generalize Theorem 1.3:\nTheorem 4.5 The following conditions are equivalent:\ni) \u03b2ijp (R/I) = \u03b2ijp (R/ Lex(I)) for all i, j, p.\nii) \u03b21jn (R/I) = \u03b21jn (R/ Lex(I)) for all j.\niii) I is a Gotzmann ideal.\niv) \u03b20jp (R/I) = \u03b20jp (R/ Lex(I)) for all j, p and I is componentwise linear.\nProof: Set L = Lex(I). i) \u21d2 ii) is obvious and ii) \u21d2 iii) holds by Theorem 1.3. A\nGotzmann ideal is clearly componentwise linear. So to prove that iii) implies iv), it suffices\nto prove that \u03b20jp (R/I) = \u03b20jp (R/L) for all j, p. By Remark 4.3 passing to the gin does\nnot change \u03b20jp . So we may replace I with Gin(I) which is still Gotzmann. In other words\n12\n\n\fwe may assume that I is Borel-fixed and \u03b21 (R/I) = \u03b21 (R/L). Then by 4.1 and 3.7 we\nknow that \u03b20jp (R/I) = \u03b20jp (R/L) for all j, p. Finally, we prove that iv) implies i). Since I\nis componentwise linear, by virtue of Theorem 3.4, we may replace I with its gin, that is,\nwe may assume that I is Borel-fixed. The assumption \u03b20jp (R/I) = \u03b20jp (R/L), by virtue of\nLemma 3.4 translates into m\u2264i (Ij ) = m\u2264i (Lj ) for all i and j. By 3.7 and 4.1 this implies\n\u03b2ijp (R/I) = \u03b2ijp (R/L) for all i, j, p.\nRemark/Example 4.6 a) With the notation and the assumption of 3.6, it is not true\nin general that mij (I) \u2264 mij (J) for all i, j. For instance take I = (x1 , x2 )2 + (x1 , x2 , x3 )3 .\nThen I is Borel-fixed, its lex-segment ideal is L = x1 (x1 , x2 , x3 ) + (x1 , x2 , x3 )3 . By 4.1 we\nknow that m\u2264i (Lj ) \u2264 m\u2264i (Ij ) for all i, j but m22 (I) = 2 and m22 (L) = 1.\nb) By 3.7 and 4.1 we know that a Borel-fixed ideal I with lex-segment ideal L is Gotzmann\niff mi (I) = mi (L) for all i. This is an example, perhaps the smallest one, of a Borel-fixed\nGotzmann ideal I which is not a lex-segment ideal. In K[x1 , x2 , x3 ] consider\nI = (x31 , x21 x2 , x21 x3 , x1 x22 , x1 x2 x3 , x32 , x22 x3 ).\nIts lex-segment ideal is\nL = (x31 , x21 x2 , x21 x3 , x1 x22 , x1 x2 x3 , x1 x23 , x32 ).\nTo verify that I is Gotzmann it suffices to note that m1 (I) = m1 (L) = 1, m2 (I) =\nm2 (L) = 2 and m3 (I) = m3 (L) = 4.\n\n5. Comparing the gins\nGiven a homogeneous ideal I we may consider the set\nGins(I) = {Gin\u03c4 (I) : \u03c4 is a term order }\nof all the generic initial ideals of I. Among them, the gin-revlex (which we simply denote by\nGin(I)) plays a special role. For instance, it is known that projdim(I) = projdim(Gin(I))\nand reg(I) = reg(Gin(I)), where projdim and reg denote the projective dimension and the\nCastelnuovo-Mumford regularity, see [BS]. It follows that projdim(J) \u2265 projdim(Gin(I))\nand reg(J) \u2265 reg(Gin(I)) for all J \u2208 Gins(I). We generalize this and show that:\nTheorem 5.1\n\nLet I be a homogeneous ideal. Let \u03c4 be a term order. Then\n\u03b2ijp (Gin(I)) \u2264 \u03b2ijp (Gin\u03c4 (I))\n13\n\n\ffor every i, j, p.\nProof: Set J = Gin(I) and H = Gin\u03c4 (I). Note J and H are Borel-fixed ideals with the\nsame Hilbert function. By virtue of 3.6 it is therefore enough to show that m\u2264i (Hj ) \u2264\nm\u2264i (Jj ) for all i and j. Let a1 . . . , ak be the generators of Jj and b1 . . . , bk that of Hj .\nWe may order the ar 's and the br 's according to the revlex order. Since by Lemma 2.3\nGin(H) = H, it follows from [C, Corollary 6] that ar \u2265 br in the revlex order for all r.\nThis implies that max(ar ) \u2264 max(br ) for all r and hence m\u2264i (Hj ) \u2264 m\u2264i (Jj ).\nMore generally, the proof above shows that Theorem 5.1 holds also if Gin\u03c4 (I) is\nreplaced by any Borel-fixed initial ideal of I. Theorem 5.1 should be compared with the\nexample in [CE] showing that, in general, there is no ideal with the smallest Betti numbers\nin the family of ideals with a given Hilbert function and with the example in [F, Section 6]\nshowing that there is no ideal with the smallest Betti numbers in the family of Borel-fixed\nideals with a given Hilbert function. Another application of [C,Corollary 6] yields easily:\nProposition 5.2 Among all the elements in Gins(I) the gin-lex is the closest to the\nlex-segment ideal of I, in the sense that if L is the lex-segment ideal of I, J is the gin-lex\nof I and H is any other gin of I then dim(L \u2229 J)j \u2265 dim(L \u2229 H)j for all j.\nWe know that the lex-segment ideal has the largest Betti numbers in the class of the\nideals with a given Hilbert function and that in Gins(I) the gin-lex is the closest ideal to\nthe lex-segment. Therefore it makes sense to ask whether the gin-lex has the largest Betti\nnumbers among all the ideals in Gins(I) . It turns out that (quite surprisingly) this is not\nthe case in general. Even more interesting, there are ideals I such that there is no ideal\nwith the largest Betti numbers in Gins(I) and the gin-lex need not have maximal Betti\nnumbers. The main difficulty in finding examples with these pathologies is that one must\nbe able to detect all the gins of a given ideal which is a hard task. The examples we are\ngoing to present belong to a family of ideals called almost Borel-fixed. Let us define this\nfamily. Let d \u2208 N. Given a Borel-fixed space of monomials A in Md and a monomial\nb \u2208 Md we say that b is a lower neighbor of A if b 6\u2208 A and a \u2208 A whenever a >Borel b. We\ndenote by Ln(A) the set of the lower neighbor of A.\nDefinition 5.3 Let A be a Borel-fixed space of monomials in Md . Let W be the vector\nspace generated by the elements in Ln(A) and let V \u2286 W be a subspace. The vector space\nA + V is called an almost Borel-fixed space. A homogeneous ideal I is said to be almost\nBorel-fixed if for each d \u2208 N the space Id is almost Borel-fixed.\nThe main property of almost Borel-fixed spaces and ideals is that one has a complete\ndescription of the set of all the gins. We have:\nProposition 5.4\n\nLet A and V be as in the Definition 5.3. Then for every term order \u03c4\n14\n\n\fone has:\nGin\u03c4 (A + V ) = A + in\u03c4 (V ).\n\nProof: The left and right hand side of the equality we have to prove are vector spaces of\nthe same dimension. Therefore it is enough to prove the inclusion \u2287. Since A + V \u2287 A\nwe have Gin\u03c4 (A + V ) \u2287 Gin\u03c4 (A) = A. To conclude the proof we need to show that for a\ngeneric g \u2208 GLn (K) and for all f \u2208 V one has in\u03c4 (f ) \u2208 in\u03c4 (g(A + V )). Let m be a lower\nneighbor of A. Note that A and A \u222a {m} are Borel-fixed sets. Then, by virtue of 2.3 and\n2.4, in\u03c4 (g(A)) = A and the normal form of g(m) with respect to g(A) has the form m + h\nwhere h contains only monomials which are smaller (in the Borel order) then m. Now say\nf = \u03bb1 m1 + . . . + \u03bbr mr where the mi are lower neighbors of A and \u03bbi \u2208 K. It follows that\nthe normal form of g(f ) with respect to g(A) is f + H and each monomial in H is smaller\nin the Borel order than some of the mi . This implies that in\u03c4 (f + H) = in\u03c4 (f ) and hence\nthat in\u03c4 (f ) \u2208 in\u03c4 (g(A + V )).\nSince Gin\u03c4 (I) = \u2295d Gin\u03c4 (Id ), Proposition 5.4 allows us to describe all the gins of an\nalmost Borel-fixed ideal provided, of course, we have a description of the decomposition of\nId as \"A+V \" for each d. Note however that if U is an almost Borel-fixed space then U R1\nneed not be almost Borel-fixed, see the next example.\nExample 5.5 a) The simplest almost Borel-fixed space (which is not Borel-fixed) is the\nfollowing: in 3 variables, A = hx21 , x1 x2 i, Ln(A) = {x1 x3 , x22 } and V = hx1 x3 + x22 i. Then,\naccording to Proposition 5.4, the almost Borel-fixed space U = A +V has only two distinct\ngins, the gin-revlex A + hx22 i and the gin-lex A + hx1 x3 i.\nb) if we embed the example of part a) in a ring with an extra variable x4 then it is still\nalmost Borel-fixed but it is easy to see that R1 U is not almost Borel-fixed.\nConstruction 5.6 One can construct an almost Borel-fixed ideal as follows: Let T be\na set of Borel-incomparable elements in Md . Set\nX = hn \u2208 Md : there exists m \u2208 T such that n \u2265Borel mi\nA = hn \u2208 Md : there exists m \u2208 T such that n >Borel mi.\nLet f1 , . . . , fp be polynomials with disjoint supports such that each fi is a sum of elements\nin T . Let B be a Borel-fixed subspace of Md+1 such that B contains XR1 (e.g. B = XR1\nor B = Md+1 ). Then the ideal I = (A) + (f1 , . . . , fp ) + (B) is almost Borel-fixed and:\nGin\u03c4 (I) = (A) + (in\u03c4 (f1 ), . . . , in\u03c4 (fp )) + (B).\n15\n\n\fOne can iterate the construction by taking a set of incomparable elements in Md+1 \\ B and\nso on to get an almost Borel-fixed ideal which is non-Borel fixed in more than one degree.\nExample 5.7 Applying Construction 5.6 in K[x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ] to T = {x1 x23 , x22 x4 } with\np = 1, f = x1 x23 + x22 x4 , and B = XR1 one gets\nA = hx31 , x21 x2 , x21 x3 , x21 x4 , x1 x22 , x1 x2 x3 , x1 x2 x4 , x32 , x22 x3 i\nand the ideal\nI = (A) + (f ) + (x22 x24 ).\nThe ideal I is almost Borel-fixed and has exactly two gins. The gin-lex (which is also the\ngin-revlex in this case) is:\nG1 = (A) + (x1 x23 , x22 x24 )\nand the gin with respect to the term order induced, for instance, by the weight function\n(6, 5, 2, 1) is\nG2 = (A) + (x22 x4 , x1 x33 , x1 x23 x4 ).\nThe Macaulay diagrams of the Betti numbers of G1 and G2 are respectively\n10 17 10 2\n1\n3 3 1\n\n10 18 12\n2 5 4\n\n3\n1\n\nThis shows that the gin-lex need not have the largest Betti numbers among all the gins of\na given ideal.\nIn order to describe an ideal I such that in Gins(I) there is no ideal with largest Betti\nnumbers we need to enlarge a little the ambient space, i.e. we need more variables and\nhigher degree monomials.\nExample 5.8\n\nApplying Construction 5.6 in K[x1 , . . . , x7 ] to\nT = {x1 x3 x26 , x22 x3 x7 , x1 x24 x6 , x22 x24 }\n\nwith p = 2, f1 = x1 x3 x26 + x22 x3 x7 and f2 = x1 x24 x6 + x22 x24 , and B = XR1 one gets\nA = hx41 , x31 x2 , x31 x3 , x31 x4 , x31 x5 , x31 x6 , x31 x7 , x21 x22 , x21 x2 x3 , x21 x2 x4 , x21 x2 x5 , x21 x2 x6 ,\nx21 x2 x7 , x21 x23 , x21 x3 x4 , x21 x3 x5 , x21 x3 x6 , x21 x3 x7 , x21 x24 , x21 x4 x5 , x21 x4 x6 , x21 x25 ,\nx21 x5 x6 , x21 x26 , x1 x32 , x1 x22 x3 , x1 x22 x4 , x1 x22 x5 , x1 x22 x6 , x1 x22 x7 , x1 x2 x23 , x1 x2 x3 x4 ,\nx1 x2 x3 x5 , x1 x2 x3 x6 , x1 x2 x3 x7 , x1 x2 x24 , x1 x2 x4 x5 , x1 x2 x4 x6 , x1 x2 x25 , x1 x2 x5 x6 ,\nx1 x2 x26 , x1 x33 , x1 x23 x4 , x1 x23 x5 , x1 x23 x6 , x1 x3 x24 , x1 x3 x4 x5 , x1 x3 x4 x6 , x1 x3 x25 ,\nx1 x3 x5 x6 , x1 x34 , x1 x24 x5 , x42 , x32 x3 , x32 x4 , x32 x5 , x32 x6 , x32 x7 , x22 x23 , x22 x3 x4 , x22 x3 x5 ,\nx22 x3 x6 i\n16\n\n\fand\nI = (A) + (f1 , f2 ) + (x1 x24 x6 x7 , x22 x3 x27 , x1 x24 x26 ).\nThe ideal I is almost Borel-fixed and has exactly 3 gins. The gin-revlex\nG1 = (A) + (x22 x24 , x1 x3 x26 ) + (x1 x24 x6 x7 , x22 x3 x27 , x1 x24 x26 ),\nthe gin-lex\nG2 = (A) + (x1 x24 x6 , x1 x3 x26 ) + (x22 x24 x7 , x22 x3 x27 , x22 x24 x6 , x22 x24 x5 , x22 x34 )\nand the gin w.r.t. to the term order induced by the weight (7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1)\nG3 = (A) + (x22 x24 , x22 x3 x7 ) + (x1 x24 x6 x7 , x1 x3 x26 x7 , x1 x24 x26 , x1 x3 x36 ).\nHere the crucial observation is that there are no term orders such the in(f1 ) = x22 x3 x7\nand in(f2 ) = x1 x24 x6 . The Macaulay diagrams of the Betti numbers of G1 , G2 and G3 are\nrespectively:\n64 240 397 363 190 53 6\n3 17 40 50 35 13 2\n64 242 404 372 195 54 6\n5 24 49 55 36 13 2\n64 241 402 373 200 58 7\n4 22 50 60 40 14 2\nTherefore there is no gin with the largest Betti numbers since G2 and G3 have maximal\nand incomparable Betti diagrams.\nA slight variation in the construction above allows also to describe ideals such that the\ngin-lex does not even have the largest Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity among all the gins.\nOne may ask whether ideals with few generators can behave as the ideals of Examples 5.7\nand 5.8. There are experimental evidences that even a monomial ideal with 2 generators\ncan have these behaviors. For instance, we have run CoCoA to get the gins of the ideal\nI = (x41 , x22 x3 x4 ). The computations show that the gin-lex of I does not have maximal\nBetti numbers and that the there seems to be 351 gins with 3 different set of maximal\nBetti numbers. The problem with these computations is twofold: first when we compute\nin\u03c4 (g(I)) by taking a random (upper triangular) matrix g what we get is Gin\u03c4 (I) but only\n\"with high probability\", and, second, it is not clear how can we be sure that the list of the\ngins is complete.\nLet us conclude the section by showing that:\n17\n\n\fProposition 5.9\n\nAn almost Borel-fixed ideal is componentwise linear.\n\nProof: Let \u03c4 be the revlex order. Let A, V be as in Definition 5.3. Let f1 , . . . , fp be\ngenerators of V . It is harmless to assume that the monomials in\u03c4 (fi ) are distinct. Let D\nbe the set of the monomials in A and set G = D \u222a{f1 , . . . , fp }. Let I be the ideal generated\nby the set G. We have to show that I has a linear resolution. Set mi = in\u03c4 (fi ) and let\nJ be the ideal generated by D and by m1 , . . . , mp . Note that J has a linear resolution\nsince it is a Borel-fixed ideal generated in a single degree. Therefore it suffices to show\nthat in\u03c4 (I) = J or, equivalently, that G is a Gr\u00f6bner basis. We apply the Buchberger\nalgorithm to G. Set in\u03c4 (G) = D \u222a {m1 , . . . , mp }. It is suffices to show that any S polynomial which correspond to a minimal syzygy among elements of in\u03c4 (G) reduces to 0\nvia G. The elements of in\u03c4 (G) generate a Borel-fixed space. Their minimal syzygies are\ndescribed by the Eliahou-Kervaire resolution. They have the following form: For every\nterm n \u2208 in\u03c4 (G) and any j < i = max(n) set n1 = nxj /xi . Then n1 \u2208 in\u03c4 (G) and\nxj n \u2212 xi n1 = 0 is a minimal syzygy. If n \u2208 D then n1 \u2208 D as well and the corresponding\nS-polynomial is 0 as any S-polynomial among monomials. If instead n 6\u2208 D, then n = mk\nfor some k, say k = 1. In this case n1 must be in D since by construction n1 >Borel n\nand, by the very definition of almost Borel-fixed space, n is a lower neighbor of A. So the\nS-polynomial corresponding to the given syzygy is S = xj f1 \u2212 xi n1 . Let b be a non-initial\nmonomial of f1 and set u = max(b). Then i = max(m1 ) \u2264 max(b) = u (here we use the\nfact that the term order is revlex) and the xj b = xu b1 with b1 = xj a/xu \u2208 D since b is\nalso a lower neighbor of A and b1 >Borel b. This implies that S, being a sum of multiples\nof monomials of D, reduces to 0 via G.\nNote that, with the notation of the proof of 5.9, we did not prove that Gin(I) = J,\njust that in(I) = J. But since, a posteriori, we know that I is componentwise linear then\nits gin-revlex must be generated in the initial degree and then it follows from Proposition\n5.4 that Gin(I) = J. Simple examples show that that, in general, the non-revlex gins of I\nmight need generators in higher degrees.\n\n6. Some Questions\nWe have shown that, passing to a generic initial ideal, the Koszul-Betti numbers can\nonly increase. Most likely the same is true for any initial ideal.\nQuestion 6.1\norders \u03c4 ?\n\nIs it true that \u03b2ijp (R/I) \u2264 \u03b2ijp (R/ in\u03c4 (I)) for all i, j, p and for all term\n\nHow much of what we have shown can be extended to positive characteristic? For\ninstance:\n18\n\n\fQuestion 6.2\ncharacteristic?\n\nDo Theorem 4.2(b) and Theorem 5.1 hold if the base field has positive\n\nWe have seen that the gin-lex need not have the largest Betti numbers among all the\ngins of a given ideal. But, of course, it does it whenever it is the lex-segment. On the\nother hand, the gin-lex is very rarely equal to the lex-segment, even for ideals generated\nby generic polynomials. For instance the gin-lex of two generic quadrics in four variables\ndiffers from the lex-segment already in degree 4. However there are experimental evidences\nthat the answer to the following questions might be positive:\nQuestion 6.3 Let I be the ideal generated by m generic forms of degree d in n variables\nwith m \u2265 n. Is it true the gin-lex of I equals the lex-segment?\nQuestion 6.4 Let I be an ideal generated by generic forms of given degrees. Does the\ngin-lex have the largest Betti numbers among all the gins of I?\nNote that the set Gins(I) can be very large even for \"small\" ideals. For instance in\nfour variables, for two generic cubics we have detected 93 distinct gins (and most likely\nthere are no others) while for two generic quartics we have detected more than 3000 gins\n(and most likely there are many others). In this case we have checked that the gin-lex\nhave the largest Betti numbers among all the gins we have found.\nIn view of Theorem 1.2 and Theorem 1.3, one could ask what happens if we assume\nthat \u03b2i (R/I) = \u03b2i (R/ Gin(I)) or \u03b2i (R/I) = \u03b2i (R/ Lex(I)) for some i > 0. We cannot conclude that all the Betti numbers are equal. This is because some Betti numbers (typically\nthe last) can be forced by the Hilbert function. For instance all the rings with Hilbert\nfunction 1, 3, 4, 0 have the same last Betti number but the rest of the resolution can vary.\nOn the other hand there might be some sort of rigidity toward the end of the resolution\nand the following might be true.\nQuestion 6.5 Let I be an homogeneous ideal and J be either Gin(I) or Lex(I). Assume\nthat \u03b2i (R/I) = \u03b2i (R/J) for some i > 0. Does this imply that \u03b2j (R/I) = \u03b2j (R/J) for all\nj \u2265 i?\nIf we assume that I is Borel-fixed and J is Lex(I) then it follows easily from the\nproof of 3.6 that \u03b2i (R/I) = \u03b2i (R/J) implies mj (I) = mj (J) for all j \u2265 i. But then\n\u03b2j (R/I) = \u03b2j (R/J) for all j \u2265 i follows from the Eliahou-Kervaire formula.\nThanks: The results, the examples and the open questions presented in this the paper\nhave been inspired and suggested by computations performed by the computer algebra\nsystem CoCoA [CNR].\n19\n\n\fReferences\n[AH] A.Aramova, J.Herzog, Koszul cycles and Eliahou-Kervaire type resolutions, J.
