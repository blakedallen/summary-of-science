I present preliminary results for a sample of \u223c700 red giants in \u03c9 Cen,\nobserved during the Ital-FLAMES Consortium GTO time in May 2003, for the Bologna\nProject on \u03c9 Cen. Preliminary Fe and Ca abundances confirm previous results: while\nthe metal-poor and intermediate populations show a normal halo \u03b1-enhancement of\n[\u03b1/Fe]\u2243+0.3, the most metal-rich stars show a significantly lower [\u03b1/Fe]\u2243+0.1. If the\nmetal-rich stars have evolved within the cluster in a process of self-enrichment, the\nonly way to lower their \u03b1-enhancement would be SNe type Ia intervention.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe treatment of the large data volumes that can be obtained with large telescopes and multi-objects spectrographs, such as FLAMES at the ESO VLT,\nrequires a major upgrade of the methods commonly used to reduce and analyze\nhigh and medium resolution spectra.\nWe are therefore developing a set of routines for an automatic or semiautomatic abundance analysis of stellar spectra based on equivalent widths\n(EW). The first product is DAOSPEC, a code developed by P. B. Stetson for automatic EW measurement (http://cadcwww.hia.nrc. ca/stetson/daospec/). The\npreliminary abundance analysis presented here is the first step of an iteractive\nand automatic procedure under development at the Bologna Observatory.\n\n2\n\nAnalysis and Results\n\nPart of the Ital-FLAMES Guranteed Time has been devoted to the study of\n\u03c9 Cen, within the framework of the Bologna Project on \u03c9 Cen [1]. 700 giants\nhave been observed with the ESO-VLT GIRAFFE spectrograph in May 2003,\nwith a resolution of R\u223c20,000 and a S/N\u224350\u2013150 per pixel, spanning more than\n4 magnitudes and covering all known sub-populations in the cluster. The spectral\nranges observed (Setups HR09, HR13, HR11 and HR15) allow the determination\nof iron peak, \u03b1, s-process elements and of Eu.\nThe spectra have been reduced with the GIRAFFE BLDRS pipeline developed at the Geneva Observatory. EW have been measured with DAOSPEC [2],\nbased on a linelist produced with the Vienna Atomic Line Database (VALD)\n[3]. Preliminary estimates of the stellar parameters Tef f , log g, vt and [M/H]\nhave been obtained from the WFI photometry published by [4] and the colortemperature calibration by [5]. MARCS model stellar atmospheres [6] have been\n\n\f2\n\nElena Pancino\n\nFig. 1. [Ca/Fe] versus [Fe/H] for the \u223c700 stars observed with GIRAFFE. Typical\nerrorbars are plotted in the lower-right corner. The typical disk-halo behaviour is represented by dotted lines.\n\nemployed together with the abundance analysis code by [7] to produce a first\nguess abundance of Fe and Ca, strictly based on the photometric parameter\nestimates.\nThe resulting [Ca/Fe] versus [Fe/H] plot is shown in Fig. 1, where except for\na few outliers that will have to be manually inspected, a clear trend appears:\n[Ca/Fe] slowly rises with [Fe/H] until it reaches a maximum and then declines\nagain for the most metal-rich stars (RGB-a according to [4]). This nicely confirms\na previous finding by [8] and [9]. If the metal-rich stars have evolved within the\ncluster in a process of self-enrichment, the only way to lower their \u03b1-enhancement\nwould be SNe type Ia intervention. No simple explanation is provided for the\nrise of [Ca/Fe] at low [Fe/H], although a series of star formation bursts should\nbe the likely cause.\n\nReferences\n1. Ferraro, F.
