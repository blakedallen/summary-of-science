The first\nprovides a broad historical perspective and the second illustrates key physical and conceptual\nproblems of quantum gravity. Researchers who are already quite familiar with quantum\ngravity can/should go directly to section II; there will be no loss of continuity.\nA.\n\nDevelopment of Quantum Gravity: A Bird's Eye View\n\nThe necessity of a quantum theory of gravity was pointed out by Einstein already in a\n1916 paper in the Preussische Akademie Sitzungsberichte. He wrote:\n\u2022 Nevertheless, due to the inneratomic movement of electrons, atoms would have to\nradiate not only electromagnetic but also gravitational energy, if only in tiny amounts.\nAs this is hardly true in Nature, it appears that quantum theory would have to modify\nnot only Maxwellian electrodynamics but also the new theory of gravitation. \u2022\nPapers on the subject began to appear in the 1930s most notably by Bronstein, Rosenfeld\nand Pauli. However, detailed work began only in the sixties. The general developments\nsince then loosely represent four stages, each spanning roughly a decade and a half. In this\nsection, I will present a sketch these developments.\nFirst, there was the beginning: exploration. The goal was to do unto gravity as one\nwould do unto any other physical field [9].1 The electromagnetic field had been successfully\nquantized using two approaches: canonical and covariant. In the canonical approach, electric\nand magnetic fields obeying Heisenberg's uncertainty principle are at the forefront, and\n1\n\nSince this introduction is addressed to non-experts, I will generally refer to books and review articles\nwhich summarize the state of the art at various stages of development of quantum gravity. References to\noriginal papers can be found in these reviews.\n\n\f2\nquantum states naturally arise as gauge-invariant functionals of the vector potential on a\nspatial three-slice. In the covariant approach on the on the other hand, one first isolates and\nthen quantizes the two radiative modes of the Maxwell field in space-time, without carrying\nout a (3+1)-decomposition, and the quantum states naturally arise as elements of the Fock\nspace of photons. Attempts were made to extend these techniques to general relativity. In\nthe electromagnetic case the two methods are completely equivalent. Only the emphasis\nchanges in going from one to another. In the gravitational case, however, the difference is\nprofound. This is not accidental. The reason is deeply rooted in one of the essential features\nof general relativity, namely the dual role of the space-time metric.\nTo appreciate this point, let us begin with field theories in Minkowski space-time, say\nMaxwell's theory to be specific. Here, the basic dynamical field is represented by a tensor\nfield F\u03bc\u03bd on Minkowski space. The space-time geometry provides the kinematical arena\non which the field propagates. The background, Minkowskian metric provides light cones\nand the notion of causality. We can foliate this space-time by a one-parameter family of\nspace-like three-planes, and analyze how the values of electric and magnetic fields on one\nof these surfaces determine those on any other surface. The isometries of the Minkowski\nmetric let us construct physical quantities such as fluxes of energy, momentum, and angular\nmomentum carried by electromagnetic waves.\nIn general relativity, by contrast, there is no background geometry. The space-time\nmetric itself is the fundamental dynamical variable. On the one hand it is analogous to the\nMinkowski metric in Maxwell's theory; it determines space-time geometry, provides light\ncones, defines causality, and dictates the propagation of all physical fields (including itself).\nOn the other hand it is the analog of the Newtonian gravitational potential and therefore the\nbasic dynamical entity of the theory, similar in this respect to the F\u03bc\u03bd of the Maxwell theory.\nThis dual role of the metric is in effect a precise statement of the equivalence principle that\nis at the heart of general relativity. It is this feature that is largely responsible for the\npowerful conceptual economy of general relativity, its elegance and its aesthetic beauty, its\nstrangeness in proportion. However, this feature also brings with it a host of problems. We\nsee already in the classical theory several manifestations of these difficulties. It is because\nthere is no background geometry, for example, that it is so difficult to analyze singularities\nof the theory and to define the energy and momentum carried by gravitational waves. Since\nthere is no a priori space-time, to introduce notions as basic as causality, time, and evolution,\none must first solve the dynamical equations and construct a space-time. As an extreme\nexample, consider black holes, whose traditional definition requires the knowledge of the\ncausal structure of the entire space-time. To find if the given initial conditions lead to the\nformation of a black hole, one must first obtain their maximal evolution and, using the causal\nstructure determined by that solution, ask if the causal past J \u2212 (I + ) of its future infinity I +\nis the entire space-time. If not, space-time contains a black hole and the future boundary of\nJ ( I + ) within that space-time is its event horizon. Thus, because there is no longer a clean\nseparation between the kinematical arena and dynamics, in the classical theory substantial\ncare and effort is needed even in the formulation of basic physical questions.\nIn quantum theory the problems become significantly more serious. To see this, recall first\nthat, because of the uncertainty principle, already in non-relativistic quantum mechanics,\nparticles do not have well-defined trajectories; time-evolution only produces a probability\namplitude, \u03a8(x, t), rather than a specific trajectory, x(t). Similarly, in quantum gravity,\neven after evolving an initial state, one would not be left with a specific space-time. In the\nabsence of a space-time geometry, how is one to introduce even habitual physical notions\n\n\f3\nsuch as causality, time, scattering states, and black holes?\nThe canonical and the covariant approaches adopted dramatically different attitudes to\nface these problems. In the canonical approach, one notices that, in spite of the conceptual\ndifficulties mentioned above, the Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity is well-defined\nand attempts to use it as a stepping stone to quantization. The fundamental canonical commutation relations are to lead us to the basic uncertainty principle. The motion generated\nby the Hamiltonian is to be thought of as time evolution. The fact that certain operators on\nthe fixed ('spatial') three-manifold commute is supposed to capture the appropriate notion\nof causality. The emphasis is on preserving the geometrical character of general relativity,\non retaining the compelling fusion of gravity and geometry that Einstein created. In the\nfirst stage of the program, completed in the early 1960s, the Hamiltonian formulation of the\nclassical theory was worked out in detail by Dirac, Bergmann, Arnowitt, Deser and Misner\nand others [2, 5, 6, 13, 16]. The basic canonical variable was the 3-metric on a spatial slice.\nThe ten Einstein's equations naturally decompose into two sets: four constraints on the\n~ = 0 of electrodynammetric and its conjugate momentum (analogous to the equation DivE\nics) and six evolution equations. Thus, in the Hamiltonian formulation, general relativity\ncould be interpreted as the dynamical theory of 3-geometries. Wheeler therefore baptized\nit geometrodynamics [3, 4].\nIn the second stage, this framework was used as a point of departure for quantum theory\nby Bergmann, Komar, Wheeler DeWitt and others. The basic equations of the quantum\ntheory were written down and several important questions were addressed [4, 16]. Wheeler\nalso launched an ambitious program in which the internal quantum numbers of elementary\nparticles were to arise from non-trivial, microscopic topological configurations and particle\nphysics was to be recast as 'chemistry of geometry'. However, most of the work in quantum geometrodynamics continued to remain formal; indeed, even today the field theoretic\ndifficulties associated with the presence of an infinite number of degrees of freedom in the\nWheeler DeWitt equation remain unresolved. Furthermore, even at the formal level, is has\nbeen difficult to solve the quantum Einstein's equations. Therefore, after an initial burst of\nactivity, the quantum geometrodynamics program became stagnant. Interesting results have\nbeen obtained by Misner, Wheeler, DeWitt and others in the limited context of quantum\ncosmology where one freezes all but a finite number of degrees of freedom. However, even in\nthis special case, the initial singularity could not be resolved without additional 'external'\ninputs into the theory, such as the use of matter violating energy conditions. Sociologically,\nthe program faced another limitation: concepts and techniques which had been so successful\nin quantum electrodynamics appeared to play no role here. In particular, in quantum geometrodynamics, it is hard to see how gravitons are to emerge, how scattering matrices are\nto be computed, how Feynman diagrams are to dictate dynamics and virtual processes are to\ngive radiative corrections. To use a well-known phrase [7], the emphasis on geometry in the\ncanonical program \"drove a wedge between general relativity and the theory of elementary\nparticles.\"\nIn the covariant2 approach [6, 8, 10] the emphasis is just the opposite. Field-theoretic\ntechniques are put at the forefront. The\n\u221a first step in this program is to split the space-time\nmetric g\u03bc\u03bd in two parts, g\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd + G h\u03bc\u03bd , where \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd is to be a background, kinematical\n2\n\nIn the context of quantum gravity, the term 'covariant' is somewhat misleading because the introduction\nof a background metric violates diffeomorphism covariance. It is used mainly to emphasize that this\napproach does not involve a 3+1 decomposition of space-time.\n\n\f4\nmetric, often chosen to be flat, G is Newton's constant, and h\u03bc\u03bd , the deviation of the physical\nmetric from the chosen background, the dynamical field. The two roles of the metric tensor\nare now split. The overall attitude is that this sacrifice of the fusion of gravity and geometry\nis a moderate price to pay for ushering-in the powerful machinery of perturbative quantum\nfield theory. Indeed, with this splitting most of the conceptual problems discussed above\nseem to melt away. Thus, in the transition to the quantum theory it is only h\u03bc\u03bd that\nis quantized. Quanta of this field propagate on the classical background space-time with\nmetric \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd . If the background is in fact chosen to be flat, one can use the Casimir operators\nof the Poincar\u00e9 group and show that the quanta have spin two and rest mass zero. These\nare the gravitons. The Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian tells us how they interact with one\nanother. Thus, in this program, quantum general relativity was first reduced to a quantum\nfield theory in Minkowski space. One could apply to it all the machinery of perturbation\ntheory that had been so successful in particle physics. One now had a definite program to\ncompute amplitudes for various scattering processes. Unruly gravity appeared to be tamed\nand forced to fit into the mold created to describe other forces of Nature. Thus, the covariant\nquantization program was more in tune with the mainstream developments in physics at the\ntime. In 1963 Feynman extended perturbative methods from quantum electrodynamics to\ngravity. A few years later DeWitt carried this analysis to completion by systematically\nformulating the Feynman rules for calculating scattering amplitudes among gravitons and\nbetween gravitons and matter quanta. He showed that the theory is unitary order by order\nin the perturbative expansion. By the early seventies, the covariant approach had led to\nseveral concrete results [8].\nConsequently, the second stage of the covariant program began with great enthusiasm and\nhope. The motto was: Go forth, perturb, and expand. The enthusiasm was first generated\nby the discovery that Yang-Mills theory coupled to fermions is renormalizable (if the masses\nof gauge particles are generated by a spontaneous symmetry-breaking mechanism).3 This led\nto a successful theory of electroweak interactions. Particle physics witnessed a renaissance of\nquantum field theory. The enthusiasm spilled over to gravity. Courageous calculations were\nperformed to estimate radiative corrections. Unfortunately, however, this research soon ran\ninto its first road block. The theory was shown to be non-renormalizable when two loop\neffects are taken into account for pure gravity and already at one loop for gravity coupled\nwith matter [17]. To appreciate the significance of this result, let us return to the quantum\ntheory of photons and electrons. This theory is perturbatively renormalizable. This means\nthat, although individual terms in the perturbation expansion of a physical amplitude may\ndiverge due to radiative corrections involving closed loops of virtual particles, these infinities\nare of a specific type; they can be systematically absorbed in the values of free parameters\nof the theory, the fine structure constant and the electron mass. Thus, by renormalizing\nthese parameters, individual terms in the perturbation series can be systematically rendered\nfinite. In quantum general relativity, such a systematic procedure is not available; infinities\nthat arise due to radiative corrections are genuinely troublesome. Put differently, quantum\ntheory acquires an infinite number of undetermined parameters. Although one can still use\nit as an effective theory in the low energy regime, regarded as a fundamental theory, it has\nno predictive power at all!\n3\n\nIn fact DeWitt's quantum gravity work [8] played a seminal role in the initial stages of the extension of\nperturbative techniques from Abelian to non-Abelian gauge theories.\n\n\f5\nBuoyed, however, by the success of perturbative methods in electroweak interactions, the\nparticle physics community was reluctant to give them up in the gravitational case. In the\ncase of weak interactions, it was known for some time that the observed low energy phenomena could be explained using Fermi's simple four-point interaction. The problem was that\nthis Fermi model led to a non-renormalizable theory. The correct, renormalizable model of\nGlashow, Weinberg and Salam agrees with Fermi's at low energies but marshals new processes at high energies which improve the ultraviolet behavior of the theory. It was therefore\nnatural to hope that the situation would be similar in quantum gravity. General relativity,\nin this analogy, would be similar to Fermi's model. The fact that it is not renormalizable\nwas taken to mean that it ignores important processes at high energies which are, however,\nunimportant at low energies, i.e., at large distances. Thus, the idea was that the correct\ntheory of gravity would differ from general relativity but only at high energies, i.e., near the\nPlanck regime. With this aim, higher derivative terms were added to the Einstein-Hilbert\nLagrangian. If the relative coupling constants are chosen judiciously, the resulting theory\ndoes in fact have a better ultraviolet behavior. Stelle, Tomboulis and others showed that\nthe theory is not only renormalizable but asymptotically free; it resembles the free theory\nin the high energy limit. Thus, the initial hope of 'curing' quantum general relativity was\nin fact realized. However, it turned out that the Hamiltonian of this theory is unbounded\nfrom below, and consequently the theory is drastically unstable! In particular, it violates\nunitarity; probability fails to be conserved. The success of the electroweak theory suggested\na second line of attack. In the approaches discussed above, gravity was considered in isolation. The successful unification of electromagnetic and weak interactions suggested the\npossibility that a consistent theory would result only when gravity is coupled with suitably\nchosen matter. The most striking implementation of this viewpoint occurred in supergravity.\nHere, the hope was that the bosonic infinities of the gravitational field would be canceled\nby those of suitably chosen fermionic sources, giving us a renormalizable quantum theory of\ngravity. Much effort went into the analysis of the possibility that the most sophisticated of\nthese theories -N = 8 supergravity- can be employed as a genuine grand unified theory.4\nIt turned out that cancelations of infinities do occur. Over the last five years or so, there\nhas been a resurgence of interest in this area [55]. It has now been shown that supergravity\nis finite to four loops even though it contains matter fields coupled to gravity. Furthermore,\nits Hamiltonian is manifestly positive and the theory is unitary. However, there are several\narguments suggesting that the theory would not be renormalizable at seven loops. This is\nstill an open issue but could be settled in the next 2-3 years.\nBy and large, the canonical approach was pursued by relativists and the covariant approach by particle physicists. In the mid 1980s, both approaches received unexpected boosts.\nThese launched the third phase in the development of quantum gravity.\nA group of particle physicists had been studying string theory to analyze strong interactions from a novel angle. The idea was to replace point particles by 1-dimensional extended\n4\n\nFor a number of years, there was a great deal of confidence, especially among particle physicists, that\nsupergravity was on the threshold of providing the complete quantum gravity theory. For instance, in\nthe centennial celebration of Einstein's birthday at the Institute of Advanced Study, Princeton [14] -the\nproceedings of which were videotaped and archived for future historians and physicists- there were two\ntalks on quantum gravity, both devoted to supergravity. A year later, in his Lucasian Chair inaugural\naddress Hawking [15] suggested that end of theoretical physics was in sight because N = 8 supergravity\nwas likely to be the final theory.\n\n\f6\nobjects -strings- and associate particle-like states with various modes of excitations of\nthe string. Initially there was an embarrassment: in addition to the spin-1 modes characteristic of gauge theories, string theory included also a spin-2, massless excitation. But it was\nsoon realized that this was a blessing in disguise: the theory automatically incorporated a\ngraviton. In this sense, gravity was already built into the theory! However, it was known\nthat the theory had a potential quantum anomaly which threatened to make it inconsistent.\nIn the mid 1980s, Greene and Schwarz showed that there is an anomaly cancelation and\nperturbative string theory could be consistent in certain space-time dimensions -26 for a\npurely bosonic string and 10 for a superstring [20, 31]. Since strings were assumed to live\nin a flat background space-time, one could apply perturbative techniques. However, in this\nreincarnation, the covariant approach underwent a dramatic revision. Since it is a theory of\nextended objects rather than point particles, the quantum theory has brand new elements; it\nis no longer a local quantum field theory. The field theoretic Feynman diagrams are replaced\nby world-sheet diagrams. This replacement dramatically improves the ultraviolet behavior\nand, although explicit calculations have been carried out only at 2 or 3 loop order, in the\nstring theory community it is widely believed that the perturbation theory is finite to all\norders; it does not even have to be renormalized. The theory is also unitary. It has a single,\nnew fundamental constant -the string tension- and, since various excited modes of the\nstring represent different particles, there is a built-in principle for unification of all interactions!5 From the viewpoint of local quantum field theories that particle physicists have used\nin studying electroweak and strong interactions, this mathematical structure seems almost\nmagical. Therefore there has been a long-standing hope in the string community that this\ntheory would encompass all of fundamental physics; it would be the 'theory of everything'.\nUnfortunately, it soon became clear that string perturbation theory also faces some serious\nlimitations. Perturbative finiteness would imply that each term in the perturbation series\nis ultra-violet finite.6 However Gross and Periwal have shown that in the case of bosonic\nstrings, when summed, the series diverges and does so uncontrollably. (Technically, it is\nnot even Borel-summable.) They also gave arguments that the conclusion would not be\nchanged if one uses superstrings instead. Independent support for these arguments has\ncome from work on random surfaces due to Ambjorn and others. One might wonder why\nthe divergence of the sum should be regarded as a serious failure of the theory. After all,\nin quantum electrodynamics, the series is also believed to diverge. Recall however that\nquantum electrodynamics is an inherently incomplete theory. It ignores many processes\nthat come into play at high energies or short distances. In particular, it completely ignores\nthe microstructure of space-time and simply assumes that space-time can be approximated\nby a smooth continuum even below the Planck scale. Therefore, it can plead incompleteness\nand shift the burden of this infinity to a more complete theory. A 'theory of everything' on\nthe other hand, has nowhere to hide. It cannot plead incompleteness and shift its burden.\nIt must face the Planck regime squarely. If the theory is to be consistent, it must have key\nnon-perturbative structures.\n5\n\n6\n\nTo date, none of the low energy reductions appears to correspond to the world we actually observe.\nNonetheless, string theory has provided us with a glimpse of an entirely new vista: the concrete possibility\nthat unification could be brought about by a tightly woven, non-local theory.\nBut it does appear that there are infrared divergences. As in QED, these are regarded as 'harmless' for\ncalculation of physical effects. I thank Ashoke Sen for discussions on this issue.\n\n\f7\nThe current and the fourth stage of the particle physics motivated approaches to quantum\ngravity is largely devoted to unraveling such structures and using them to make unsuspected\nconnections between gravity and other areas of physics such as fluid dynamics and high temperature superconductivity. It is widely believed that the AdS/CFT conjecture provides a\nnon-perturbative definition of string theory on space-times satisfying certain boundary conditions [49]. More precisely, in this correspondence string theory on asymptotically AdS\nbulk space-times is taken to be equivalent to certain gauge theories on its boundary. However, from the perspective of quantum gravity, this approach has some serious limitations.\nFirst, a negative cosmological constant in the bulk is essential to this correspondence while\nthe observed cosmological constant is positive. Considerable effort were made initially to\nextend the ideas to a positive or zero cosmological constant but they have not had notable\nsuccess. Second, the bulk space-time is 10 dimensional. One can compactify the unwanted\ndimensions using n-spheres, but the compactified directions cannot be microscopic; the correspondence requires that the radius of these spheres should equal the cosmological radius!\nSo if one just looks around, one should see these large macroscopic dimensions. Consequently, the non-perturbative string theory defined through the conjecture has little to do\nwith the macroscopic world we live in. Finally, even if one overlooks this issue and considers space-times with higher macroscopic dimensions, the AdS/CFT duality is yet to shed\nlight on the conceptually central issues such as the space-time structure inside the horizon\nof an evaporating black hole or the fate of big-bang type cosmological singularities. The\nrecent thrust -and the strength- of these developments is, rather, that they enable one\nto use known techniques from gravity and supergravity to solve some of the difficult mathematical problems encountered in the strong coupling regimes of field theories describing\nnon-gravitational systems.\nOn the relativity side, the third stage began with the following observation: the geometrodynamics program laid out by Dirac, Bergmann, Wheeler and others simplifies significantly\nif we regard a spatial connection -rather than the 3-metric- as the basic object. In fact\nwe now know that, among others, Einstein and Schr\u00f6dinger had recast general relativity\nas a theory of connections already in the fifties.(For a brief account of this fascinating history, see [33].) However, they used the 'Levi-Civita connection' that features in the parallel\ntransport of vectors and found that the theory becomes rather complicated. This episode\nhad been forgotten and connections were re-introduced afresh in the mid 1980s [22].7 How7\n\nThis reformulation used (anti-)self-dual connections which are complex. These have a direct interpretation\nin terms space-time geometry and also render the constraint equations polynomial in the basic variables.\nThis simplicity was regarded as crucial for passage to quantum theory. However, one is then faced with\nthe task of imposing appropriate quantum 'reality conditions' to ensure that the classical limit is real\ngeneral relativity. Barbero introduced real connection variables by replacing the \u00b1i in the expression of\nthe (anti-)self-dual connections with a real parameter \u03b2. However, now the connection does not have a\nnatural space-time interpretation and the constraints are no longer polynomial in the basic variables. But\nthe strategy became viable after Thiemann introduced novel ideas to handle quantization of the specific\nnon-polynomial terms that now feature in the constraints. Since then this strategy has become crucial\nbecause the rigorous functional calculus on the space of connections has so far been developed only for real\nconnections. Immirzi suggested that the value of \u03b2 could be chosen so that the leading term in black hole\nentropy is precisely (area/4l2Pl). That is why \u03b2 (which is often denoted by \u03b3 in later papers) is referred\nto as the Barbero-Immirzi parameter.\n\n\f8\never, now these are 'spin-connections' required to parallel propagate spinors, and they turn\nout to simplify Einstein's equations considerably. For example, the dynamical evolution\ndictated by Einstein's equations can now be visualized simply as a geodesic motion on the\nspace of spin-connections (with respect to a natural metric extracted from the constraint\nequations). Since general relativity is now regarded as a dynamical theory of connections,\nthis reincarnation of the canonical approach is called 'connection-dynamics'.\nPerhaps the most important advantage of the passage from metrics to connections is\nthat the phase-space of general relativity is now the same as that of gauge theories [22,\n26]. The 'wedge between general relativity and the theory of elementary particles' that\nWeinberg referred to largely disappears without having to sacrifice the geometrical essence\nof general relativity. One could now import into general relativity techniques that have\nbeen highly successful in the quantization of gauge theories. At the kinematic level, then,\nthere is a unified framework to describe all four fundamental interactions. The dynamics,\nof course, depends on the interaction. In particular, while there is a background spacetime geometry in electroweak and strong interactions, there is none in general relativity.\nTherefore, qualitatively new features arise. These were exploited in the late eighties and\nearly nineties to solve simpler models -general relativity in 2+1 dimensions [22, 23, 29];\nlinearized gravity clothed as a gauge theory [22]; and certain cosmological models. To explore\nthe physical, 3+1 dimensional theory, a 'loop representation' was introduced by Rovelli and\nSmolin. Here, quantum states were taken to be suitable functions of loops on the 3-manifold.8\nThis led to a number of interesting and intriguing results, particularly by Gambini, Pullin\nand their collaborators, relating knot theory and quantum gravity [28]. Thus, there was\nrapid and unanticipated progress in a number of directions which rejuvenated the canonical\nquantization program. Since the canonical approach does not require the introduction of\na background geometry or use of perturbation theory, and because one now has access to\nfresh, non-perturbative techniques from gauge theories, in relativity circles there is a hope\nthat this approach may lead to well-defined, non-perturbative quantum general relativity, or\nits supersymmetric version, supergravity.\nHowever, a number of these considerations remained rather formal until mid-nineties.\nPassage to the loop representation required an integration over the infinite dimensional\nspace of connections and the formal methods were insensitive to possible infinities lurking\nin the procedure. Indeed, such integrals are notoriously difficult to perform in interacting\nfield theories. To pay due respect to the general covariance of Einstein's theory, one needed\ndiffeomorphism invariant measures and there were folk-theorems to the effect that such\nmeasures did not exist!\nFortunately, the folk-theorems turned out to be incorrect. To construct a well-defined\ntheory capable of handling field theoretic issues, a quantum theory of Riemannian geometry\nwas systematically constructed in the mid-nineties [38]. This launched the fourth (and\nthe current) stage in the canonical approach. Just as differential geometry provides the\nbasic mathematical framework to formulate modern gravitational theories in the classical\ndomain, quantum geometry provides the necessary concepts and techniques in the quantum\ndomain. It is a rigorous mathematical theory which enables one to perform integration on\nthe space of connections for constructing Hilbert spaces of states and to define geometric\n8\n\nThis is the origin of the name 'loop quantum gravity'. The loop representation played an important role\nin the initial stages. Although this is no longer the case in the current, fourth phase, the name is still\nused to distinguish this approach from others.\n\n\f9\noperators corresponding, e.g. to areas of surfaces and volumes of regions, even though the\nclassical expressions of these quantities involve non-polynomial functions of the Riemannian\nmetric. There are no infinities. One finds that, at the Planck scale, geometry has a definite\ndiscrete structure. Its fundamental excitations are 1-dimensional, rather like polymers, and\nthe space-time continuum arises only as a coarse-grained approximation. The fact that the\nstructure of space-time at Planck scale is qualitatively different from Minkowski background\nused in perturbative treatments reinforced the idea that quantum general relativity (or\nsupergravity) may well be non-perturbatively finite. Quantum geometry effects have already\nbeen shown to resolve the big-bang singularity and solve some of the long-standing problems\nassociated with black holes. (See lectures by Giesel, Sahlmann and Singh at this School.)\nOver the last six years, another frontier has advanced in loop quantum gravity: spin\nfoams (and the associated development of group field theory) which provide a sum over\nhistories formulation [35, 39, 48]. The new element here is that the histories that enter the\nsum are quantum geometries of a specific type; they can be regarded as the 'time evolution'\nof the polymer-like quantum 3 geometries that emerged in the canonical approach. So far the\nsum has not been systematically derived starting from the classical theory as one generally\ndoes in, say, gauge theories. Rather, one uses semi-heuristic considerations to arrive at a\ndefinition of the 'transition amplitudes' and then explores physical properties of the resulting\nquantum theory. There are detailed arguments to the effect that one recovers the Einstein\nHilbert action in an appropriate limit. Furthermore, although the underlying theory is\ndiffeomorphism invariant, given a suitable 'boundary state', there is a conceptual framework\nto calculate n-point functions normally used in perturbative treatments. Information about\nthe background space-time on which these n-point functions live is encoded in the chosen\n'boundary state'. However, a number of important problems still remain. The status is\ndescribed in detail in the lectures by Rovelli, Speziale, Baratin, Perini, Fairbairn, Bianchi\nand Kaminski at this school.\nThe first three stages of developments in quantum gravity taught us many valuable\nlessons. Perhaps the most important among them is the realization that perturbative, field\ntheoretic methods which have been so successful in other branches of physics are inadequate\nto construct quantum gravity. The assumption that space-time can be replaced by a smooth\ncontinuum at arbitrarily small scales leads to inconsistencies. We can neither ignore the microstructure of space-time nor presuppose its nature. We must let quantum gravity itself\nreveal this structure to us.\nFor brevity and to preserve the flow of discussion, I have restricted myself to the 'mainstream' programs whose development can be continuously tracked over several decades.\nHowever, I would like to emphasize that there are a number of other highly original approaches -particularly, the Euclidean path integral approach [12], Regge calculus [24],\nasymptotic safety scenarios [47], discrete approaches [50], causal dynamical triangulations\n[30, 40], twistor theory [11, 21, 43] and the theory of H-spaces [18], asymptotic quantization\n[19], non-commutative geometry [25], causal sets [37, 44] and Topos theory [51, 56]. Ideas\nunderlying several of these approaches are inter-related and some of them lie at the foundation of other avenues. This is particularly true of the path integral approach pioneered by\nMisner, and developed in much greater detail in the Euclidean context by Hawking, Hartle,\nHalliwell and others. Ideas developed in this approach have provided the point of departure\nfor the ongoing developments in causal dynamical triangulations, asymptotic safety and spin\nfoams.\n\n\f10\nB.\n\nPhysical Questions of Quantum Gravity\n\nApproaches to quantum gravity face two types of issues: Problems that are 'internal'\nto individual programs and physical and conceptual questions that underlie the whole\nsubject. Examples of the former are: Incorporation of physical -rather than half flat-\ngravitational fields in the twistor program, mechanisms for breaking of supersymmetry and\ndimensional reduction in string theory, and issues of space-time covariance in the canonical\napproach. In this sub-section, I will focus on the second type of issues by recalling some of\nthe long standing issues that any satisfactory quantum theory of gravity should address.\n\u2022 The Big-Bang and other singularities: It is widely believed that the prediction of a\nsingularity, such as the big-bang of classical general relativity, is primarily a signal that the\nphysical theory has been pushed beyond the domain of its validity. A key question to any\nquantum gravity theory, then, is: What replaces the big-bang? Are the classical geometry\nand the continuum picture only approximations, analogous to the 'mean (magnetization)\nfield' of ferro-magnets? If so, what are the microscopic constituents? What is the spacetime analog of a Heisenberg quantum model of a ferro-magnet? When formulated in terms\nof these fundamental constituents, is the evolution of the quantum state of the universe\nfree of singularities? General relativity predicts that the space-time curvature must grow\nunboundedly as we approach the big-bang or the big-crunch but we expect the quantum\neffects, ignored by general relativity, to intervene, making quantum gravity indispensable\nbefore infinite curvatures are reached. If so, what is the upper bound on curvature? How\nclose to the singularity can we 'trust' classical general relativity? What can we say about the\n'initial conditions', i.e., the quantum state of geometry and matter that correctly describes\nthe big-bang? If they have to be imposed externally, is there a physical guiding principle?\n\u2022 Black holes: In the early seventies, using imaginative thought experiments, Bekenstein\nargued that black holes must carry an entropy proportional to their area [12, 34, 41]. About\nthe same time, Bardeen, Carter and Hawking (BCH) showed that black holes in equilibrium\nobey two basic laws, which have the same form as the zeroth and the first laws of thermodynamics, provided one equates the black hole surface gravity \u03ba to some multiple of the\ntemperature T in thermodynamics and the horizon area ahor to a corresponding multiple of\nthe entropy S [12, 34, 41]. However, at first this similarity was thought to be only a formal analogy because the BCH analysis was based on classical general relativity and simple\ndimensional considerations show that the proportionality factors must involve Planck's constant ~. Two years later, using quantum field theory on a black hole background space-time,\nHawking showed that black holes in fact radiate quantum mechanically as though they are\nblack bodies at temperature T = ~\u03ba/2\u03c0 [12, 27]. Using the analogy with the first law, one\ncan then conclude that the black hole entropy should be given by SBH = ahor /4G~. This\nconclusion is striking and deep because it brings together the three pillars of fundamental physics -general relativity, quantum theory and statistical mechanics. However, the\nargument itself is a rather hodge-podge mixture of classical and semi-classical ideas, reminiscent of the Bohr theory of atom. A natural question then is: what is the analog of the\nmore fundamental, Pauli-Schr\u00f6dinger theory of the Hydrogen atom? More precisely, what\nis the statistical mechanical origin of black hole entropy? What is the nature of a quantum\nblack hole and what is the interplay between the quantum degrees of freedom responsible\nfor entropy and the exterior curved geometry? Can one derive the Hawking effect from first\nprinciples of quantum gravity? Is there an imprint of the classical singularity on the final\n\n\f11\nquantum description, e.g., through 'information loss' ?\n\u2022 Planck scale physics and the low energy world: In general relativity, there is no\nbackground metric, no inert stage on which dynamics unfolds. Geometry itself is dynamical. Therefore, as indicated above, one expects that a fully satisfactory quantum gravity\ntheory would also be free of a background space-time geometry. However, of necessity, a\nbackground independent description must use physical concepts and mathematical tools\nthat are quite different from those of the familiar, low energy physics. A major challenge\nthen is to show that this low energy description does arise from the pristine, Planckian\nworld in an appropriate sense, bridging the vast gap of some 16 orders of magnitude\nin the energy scale. In this 'top-down' approach, does the fundamental theory admit a\n'sufficient number' of semi-classical states? Do these semi-classical sectors provide enough\nof a background geometry to anchor low energy physics? Can one recover the familiar\ndescription? If the answers to these questions are in the affirmative, can one pin point\nwhy the standard 'bottom-up' perturbative approach fails? That is, what is the essential\nfeature which makes the fundamental description mathematically coherent but is absent in\nthe standard perturbative quantum gravity?\nThere are of course many more challenges: adequacy of standard quantum mechanics,\nthe issue of time, of measurement theory and the associated questions of interpretation of\nthe quantum framework, the issue of diffeomorphism invariant observables and practical\nmethods of computing their properties, convenient ways of computing time evolution and Smatrices, exploration of the role of topology and topology change, etc, etc. In loop quantum\ngravity described in the rest of this chapter, one adopts the view that the three issues\ndiscussed in detail are more basic from a physical viewpoint because they are rooted in\ngeneral conceptual questions that are largely independent of the specific approach being\npursued. Indeed they have been with us longer than any of the current leading approaches.\nII.\n\nLOOP QUANTUM GRAVITY\n\nIn this section, I will summarize the overall viewpoint, achievements, challenges and opportunities underlying loop quantum gravity. The emphasis is on structural and conceptual\nissues. Detailed treatments of the subject can be found in lectures by Giesel, Sahlmann,\nRovelli and Singh in these proceedings and even more complete and more technical accounts\nin [38, 39, 45] and references therein. (The development of the subject can be seen by following older monographs [22, 26, 28].) For a treatment at a more elementary (i.e. advanced\nundergraduate) level, see [53].\nA.\n\nViewpoint\n\nIn loop quantum gravity, one takes the central lesson of general relativity seriously: gravity is geometry whence, in a fundamental quantum gravity theory, there should be no background metric. Geometry and matter should both be 'born quantum mechanically'. Thus,\nin contrast to approaches developed by particle physicists, one does not begin with quantum matter on a background geometry and use perturbation theory to incorporate quantum\neffects of gravity. There is a manifold but no metric, or indeed any other physical fields, in\n\n\f12\nthe background.9\nIn classical gravity, Riemannian geometry provides the appropriate mathematical language to formulate the physical, kinematical notions as well as the final dynamical equations. This role is now taken by quantum Riemannian geometry. In the classical domain,\ngeneral relativity stands out as the best available theory of gravity, some of whose predictions have been tested to an amazing degree of accuracy, surpassing even the legendary tests\nof quantum electrodynamics. Therefore, it is natural to ask: Does quantum general relativity, coupled to suitable matter (or supergravity, its supersymmetric generalization) exist as\nconsistent theories non-perturbatively? There is no implication that such a theory would be\nthe final, complete description of Nature. Nonetheless, this is a fascinating and important\nopen question in its own right.\nAs explained in section I A, in particle physics circles the answer is often assumed to be\nin the negative, not because there is concrete evidence against non-perturbative quantum\ngravity, but because of the analogy to the theory of weak interactions. There, one first had a\n4-point interaction model due to Fermi which works quite well at low energies but which fails\nto be renormalizable. Progress occurred not by looking for non-perturbative formulations of\nthe Fermi model but by replacing the model by the Glashow-Salam-Weinberg renormalizable\ntheory of electro-weak interactions, in which the 4-point interaction is replaced by W \u00b1 and\nZ propagators. Therefore, it is often assumed that perturbative non-renormalizability of\nquantum general relativity points in a similar direction. However this argument overlooks\nthe crucial fact that, in the case of general relativity, there is a qualitatively new element.\nPerturbative treatments pre-suppose that the space-time can be assumed to be a continuum\nat all scales of interest to physics under consideration. This assumption is safe for weak\ninteractions. In the gravitational case, on the other hand, the scale of interest is the Planck\nlength lPl and there is no physical basis to pre-suppose that the continuum picture should\nbe valid down to that scale. The failure of the standard perturbative treatments may\nlargely be due to this grossly incorrect assumption and a non-perturbative treatment which\ncorrectly incorporates the physical micro-structure of geometry may well be free of these\ninconsistencies.\nAre there any situations, outside loop quantum gravity, where such physical expectations\nare borne out in detail mathematically? The answer is in the affirmative. There exist\nquantum field theories (such as the Gross-Neveu model in three dimensions) in which the\nstandard perturbation expansion is not renormalizable although the theory is exactly soluble!\nFailure of the standard perturbation expansion can occur because one insists on perturbing\naround the trivial, Gaussian point rather than the more physical, non-trivial fixed point of\nthe renormalization group flow. Interestingly, thanks to recent work by Reuter, Lauscher,\nPercacci, Perini and others there is now non-trivial and growing evidence that situation\nmay be similar in Euclidean quantum gravity. Impressive calculations have shown that\npure Einstein theory may also admit a non-trivial fixed point [47, 52]. Furthermore, the\nrequirement that the fixed point should continue to exist in presence of matter constrains\nthe couplings in non-trivial and interesting ways [42].\n9\n\nIn 2+1 dimensions, although one begins in a completely analogous fashion, in the final picture one can get\nrid of the background manifold as well. Thus, the fundamental theory can be formulated combinatorially\n[22, 23]. While some steps have been taken to achieve this in 3+1 dimensions, by considering 'abstract'\nspin networks in the canonical approach and 2-complexes in spin foams, one still needs a more complete\nhandle on the underlying mathematics.\n\n\f13\nHowever, as indicated in the Introduction, even if quantum general relativity did exist\nas a mathematically consistent theory, there is no a priori reason to assume that it would\nbe the 'final' theory of all known physics. In particular, as is the case with classical general\nrelativity, while requirements of background independence and general covariance do restrict\nthe form of interactions between gravity and matter fields and among matter fields themselves, the theory would not have a built-in principle which determines these interactions.\nPut differently, such a theory would not be a satisfactory candidate for unification of all\nknown forces. However, just as general relativity has had powerful implications in spite of\nthis limitation in the classical domain, quantum general relativity should have qualitatively\nnew predictions, pushing further the existing frontiers of physics. Indeed, unification does\nnot appear to be an essential criterion for usefulness of a theory even in other interactions.\nQCD, for example, is a powerful theory even though it does not unify strong interactions\nwith electro-weak ones. Furthermore, the fact that we do not yet have a viable candidate\nfor the grand unified theory does not make QCD any less useful.\nB.\n\nAdvances\n\nFrom the historical and conceptual perspectives of section I, loop quantum gravity has\nhad several successes. Thanks to the systematic development of quantum geometry, several\nof the roadblocks encountered by quantum geometrodynamics were removed. Functional\nanalytic issues related to the presence of an infinite number of degrees of freedom are\nnow faced squarely. Integrals on infinite dimensional spaces are rigorously defined and\nthe required operators have been systematically constructed. Thanks to this high level of\nmathematical precision, the Hamiltonian and the spin foam programs in loop quantum\ngravity have leaped past the 'formal' stage of development. More importantly, although\nkey issues related to quantum dynamics still remain, it has been possible to use the parts\nof the program that are already well established to extract useful and highly non-trivial\nphysical predictions. In particular, some of the long standing issues about the nature\nof the big-bang, physics of the very early universe, properties of quantum black holes,\ngiving meaning to the n-point functions in a background independent framework have been\nresolved. In this sub-section, I will further clarify some conceptual issues and discuss some\nrecent advances.\n\u2022 Quantum geometry. The specific quantum Riemannian geometry underlying loop\nquantum gravity predicts that eigenvalues of geometric operators -such as areas of 2surfaces and volumes of 3-dimensional regions- are discrete. Thus, continuum underlying\ngeneral relativity is only a coarse grained approximation. What is the direct physical\nsignificance of this specific discreteness? Recall first that, in the classical theory, differential\ngeometry simply provides us with formulas to compute areas of surfaces and volumes of\nregions in a Riemannian manifold. To turn these quantities into physical observables of\ngeneral relativity, one has to define the surfaces and regions operationally, e.g. by focusing\non surfaces of black holes or regions in which matter fields are non-zero. Once this is done,\none can simply use the formulas supplied by differential geometry to calculate values of\nthese observable. The situation is rather similar in loop quantum gravity. For instance, the\narea of the isolated horizon is a Dirac observable in the classical theory and the application\nof the quantum geometry area formula to this surface leads to physical results. In 2+1\ndimensions, Freidel, Noui and Perez have introduced point particles coupled to gravity.\n\n\f14\nThe physical distance between these particles is again a Dirac observable. When used in\nthis context, the spectrum of the length operator has direct physical meaning. In all these\nsituations, the operators and their eigenvalues correspond to the 'proper' lengths, areas\nand volumes of physical objects, measured in the rest frames. Finally sometimes questions\nare raised about compatibility between discreteness of these eigenvalues and Lorentz\ninvariance. As was emphasized by Rovelli and Speziale, there is no tension whatsoever: it\nsuffices to recall that discreteness of eigenvalues of the angular momentum operator J\u02c6z of\nnon-relativistic quantum mechanics is perfectly compatible with the rotational invariance\nof that theory.\n\u2022 Quantum cosmology. In Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) models, loop\nquantum gravity has resolved the long-standing physical problem of the fate of the big-bang\nin quantum gravity [54]. Work by Bojowald, Ashtekar, Pawlowski, Singh and others has\nshown that non-perturbative effects originating in quantum geometry create an effective\nrepulsive force which is negligible when the curvature falls significantly below the Planck\nscale but rises very quickly and dramatically in the deep Planck regime to overcome the\nclassical gravitational attraction, thereby replacing the big-bang by a quantum bounce. The\nsame is true with the big-crunch singularity in the closed models. More generally, using\neffective equations, Singh has shown that these quantum geometry effects also resolve all\nstrong curvature singularities in homogeneous isotropic models where matter sources have\nan equation of state of the type p = p(\u03c1), including the exotic singularities such as the\nbig-rip. (These can occur with non-standard matter, still described by an equation of state\np = p(\u03c1)).\nA proper treatment of anisotropies (i.e. Bianchi models) has long been a highly non-trivial\nissue in general bouncing scenarios because the anisotropic shears dominate in Einstein's\nequations in the contracting phase before the bounce, diverging (as 1/a6 which is) faster\nthan, say, the dust or radiation matter density. Therefore, if anisotropies are added even as\na perturbation to a FLRW model, they tend to grow unboundedly. What is the situation\nin loop quantum cosmology? The issue turned out to be quite subtle and there were some\noversights at first. But a careful examination by Ashtekar, Wilson-Ewing and others has\nshown that the singularity is again resolved: any time a shear scalar -a potential for the\nWeyl curvature- or matter density approaches the Planck regime, the repulsive force of\nquantum geometry grows to dilute it. As in the isotropic case, effective equations can again\nbe used to gain physical insights. In particular they show that the matter density is again\nbounded above. Singularity resolution in these Bianchi models is also important from a\nmore general consideration. There is a conjecture due to Belinskii, Khalatnikov and Lifshitz\n(BKL) that says that as one approaches a space-like singularity in classical general relativity,\n'the terms containing time derivatives dominate over those containing spatial derivatives,\nso that the dynamics of the gravitational field at any one spatial point are better and\nbetter approximated by the dynamics of Bianchi models'. By now considerable evidence has\naccumulated in support of the BKL conjecture and it is widely believed to be essentially\ncorrect. One might therefore hope that the singularity resolution in the Bianchi models in\nloop quantum cosmology has opened a door to showing that all strong curvature, space-like\nsingularities are resolved by the quantum geometry effects underlying loop quantum gravity.\nFinally, the simplest type of (non-linear) inhomogeneous models -the 1-polarization\nGowdy space-times- have also been analyzed in detail. These models were studied extensively in the early quantum gravity literature, prior to the advent of LQC. In all cases the\n\n\f15\nsingularity had persisted. A systematic study in the context of loop quantum cosmology\nwas initiated by Mena, Martin-Benito, Pawlowski and others by making an astute use of the\nfact that the homogeneous modes of the model correspond to a Bianchi I space-time. Once\nagain, the underlying quantum geometry resolves the big-bang singularity.\nI will conclude with the discussion of a conceptual point. In general relativity, nonsingular, bouncing models can be and have been constructed by using matter fields that\nviolate energy conditions. In loop quantum cosmology, by contrast, matter fields satisfy all\nenergy conditions. How can the theory then evade singularity theorems of Penrose, Hawking\nand others? It does so because the quantum geometry effects modify the geometric, left\nhand side of Einstein's equations, whence these theorems are inapplicable. However there\nare more recent singularity theorems due to Borde, Guth and Vilenkin which do not refer to\nfield equations at all. How are these evaded? These theorems were motivated by inflationary\nscenario and therefore assume that the universe bas been eternally undergoing an expansion.\nIn loop quantum cosmology, even with an inflationary potential, the pre-bounce branch\nis contracting. Thus again the singularity is avoided because the solutions violate a key\nassumption of these theorems as well.\n\u2022 Quantum Horizons. Loop quantum cosmology illuminates dynamical ramifications of\nquantum geometry but within the context of mini and midi superspaces where an infinite\nnumber of degrees of freedom are frozen. The application to the black hole entropy problem\nis complementary in that one considers the full theory but probes consequences of quantum\ngeometry which are not sensitive to full quantum dynamics. I will discuss this topic in a\nlittle more detail because it was not covered in any of the main lectures at this school.\nAs explained in the Introduction, since mid-seventies, a key question in the subject has\nbeen: What is the statistical mechanical origin of the entropy SBH = (ahor /4l2Pl ) of large\nblack holes? What are the microscopic degrees of freedom that account for this entropy?\nThis relation implies that a solar mass black hole must have exp 1077 quantum states, a\nnumber that is huge even by the standards of statistical mechanics. Where do all these\nstates reside? To answer these questions, in the early 1990s Wheeler had suggested the\nfollowing heuristic picture, which he christened 'It from Bit'. Divide the black hole horizon\ninto elementary cells, each with one Planck unit of area, l2Pl and assign to each cell two\nmicrostates, or one 'Bit'. Then the total number of states N is given by N = 2n where\nn = (ahor /l2Pl ) is the number of elementary cells, whence entropy is given by S = ln N \u223c ahor .\nThus, apart from a numerical coefficient, the entropy ('It') is accounted for by assigning two\nstates ('Bit') to each elementary cell. This qualitative picture is simple and attractive. But\ncan these heuristic ideas be supported by a systematic analysis from first principles?\nAshtekar, Baez, Corichi and Krasnov used quantum geometry to provide such an analysis.\nThe first step was to analyze the structure of 'isolated horizons' in general relativity [41] and\nuse it in conjunction to quantum geometry to define an isolated quantum horizon. To probe\nits properties, one has to combine the isolated horizon boundary conditions from classical\ngeneral relativity and quantum Riemannian geometry of loop quantum gravity with the\nChern-Simons theory on a punctured sphere, the theory of a non-commutative torus and\nsubtle considerations involving mapping class groups. This detailed analysis showed that,\nwhile qualitative features of Wheeler's picture are borne out, geometry of a quantum horizon\nis much more subtle. First, while Wheeler's ideas hold for any 2-surface, the loop quantum\ngravity calculation requires a quantum horizon. Second, basic features of both of Wheeler's\narguments undergo a change: i) the elementary cells do not have Planck area; values of\n\n\f16\np\ntheir area are dictated by the spectrum, \u223c j(j + 1), of the area operator in loop quantum\ngravity, where j is a half integer; ii) individual cells carry much more than just one 'bit' of\ninformation; the number of states associated with any one cell is 2j + 1.\nNonetheless, a careful counting of states by Lewandowski, Domagala, Meissner and others\nhas shown that the number of microstates is again proportional to the area of the isolated\nhorizon. To get the exact numerical factor of 1/4, one has to fix the Barbero-Immirzi parameter of loop quantum gravity to a specific value. One can use a specific type of isolated horizon\nfor this -e.g. the spherically symmetric one with zero charge, or the cosmological one in\nthe de Sitter space-time. Once the value of the parameter is fixed, one gets the correct numerical coefficient in the leading order contribution for isolated horizons with arbitrary mass\nand angular momentum moments, charge, etc. (One also obtains a precise logarithmic subleading correction, whose coefficient does not depend on the Barbero-Immirzi parameter.)\nThe final result has two significant differences with respect to the string theory calculations:\ni) one does not require near-extremality; one can handle ordinary 4-dimensional black holes\nof direct astrophysical interest which may be distorted and/or rotating; and, ii) one can\nsimultaneously incorporate cosmological horizons for which thermodynamics considerations\nalso apply [12].\nWhy does this value of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter not depend on non-gravitational\ncharges? This important property can be traced back to a key consequence of the isolated\nhorizon boundary conditions: detailed calculations show that only the gravitational part of\nthe symplectic structure has a surface term at the horizon; the matter symplectic structures\nhave only volume terms. (Furthermore, the gravitational surface term is insensitive to\nthe value of the cosmological constant.) Consequently, there are no independent surface\nquantum states associated with matter. This provides a natural explanation of the fact\nthat the Hawking-Bekenstein entropy depends only on the horizon area and is independent\nof electro-magnetic (or other) charges. (For more detailed accounts of these results, see\n[38, 41].)\nOver the last three years there has been a resurgence of interest in the subject, thanks to\nthe impressive use of number theory techniques by Barbero, Villasenor, Agullo, Borja, DiazPolo and to sharpen and very significantly extend the counting of horizon states. These\ntechniques have opened new avenues to further explore the microstates of the quantum\nhorizon geometry through contributions by Perez, Engle, Noui, Pranzetti, Ghosh, Mitra,\nKaul, Majumdar and others.\nTo summarize, as in other approaches to black hole entropy, concrete progress could be\nmade in loop quantum gravity because: i) the analysis does not require detailed knowledge\nof how quantum dynamics is implemented in full theory, and, ii) restriction to large black\nholes implies that the Hawking radiation is negligible, whence the black hole surface can\nbe modeled by an isolated horizon [41]. The states responsible for entropy have a direct\ninterpretation in space-time terms: they refer to the geometry of the quantum, isolated\nhorizon.\n\u2022 Quantum Einstein's equations in the canonical framework. The challenge of quantum dynamics in the full theory is to find solutions to the quantum constraint equations\nand endow these physical states with the structure of an appropriate Hilbert space. The\ngeneral consensus in the loop quantum gravity community is that while the situation is wellunderstood for the Gauss and diffeomorphism constraints, it is far from being definitive for\nthe Hamiltonian constraint. Non-trivial development due to Thiemann is that well-defined\n\n\f17\ncandidate operators representing the Hamiltonian constraint exist on the space of solutions\nto the Gauss and diffeomorphism constraints [45]. However there are several ambiguities\n[38] and, unfortunately, we do not understand the physical meaning of choices made to resolve them. Detailed analysis in the limited context of loop quantum cosmology has shown\nthat choices which appear to be mathematically natural can nonetheless lead to unacceptable physical consequences such as departures from general relativity in completely tame\nsituations with low curvature [54]. Therefore, much more work is needed in the full theory.\nThe current status can be summarized as follows. Four main avenues have been pursued\nto construct and solve the quantum Hamiltonian constraint. The first is the 'Master constraint program' introduced by Thiemann [45].\nis to avoid using an infinite\nR The idea here\n3\nnumber of Hamiltonian constraints S(N) = N(x)S(x)d x, each smeared by a so-called\n'lapse function' N. Instead, one squares the integrand S(x) itself in an appropriate sense\nand then integrates it on the 3-manifold M. In simple examples, this procedure leads to\nphysically viable quantum theories. However, in loop quantum gravity the procedure does\nnot remove any of the ambiguities in the definition of the Hamiltonian constraint. Rather,\nif the ambiguities are resolved, the principal strength of the strategy lies in its potential\nto complete the last step in quantum dynamics: finding the physically appropriate scalar\nproduct on physical states. The general philosophy is similar to that advocated by John\nKlauder over the years in his approach to quantum gravity based on coherent states [36].\nA second strategy to solve the quantum Hamiltonian constraint is due to Gambini, Pullin\nand their collaborators. It builds on their extensive work on the interplay between quantum\ngravity and knot theory [28]. The more recent of these developments use the relatively new\ninvariants of intersecting knots discovered by Vassiliev. This is a novel approach which\nfurthermore has a potential of enhancing the relation between topological field theories and\nquantum gravity. As our knowledge of invariants of intersecting knots deepens, this approach could provide increasingly significant insights. In particular, it has the potential of\nleading to a formulation of quantum gravity which does not refer even to a background\nmanifold (see footnote 9).\nThe third approach comes from spin-foam models [35, 39] which, as discussed below,\nprovide a path integral approach to quantum gravity. Over the last four years, there has\nbeen extensive work in this area, discussed in the articles by Rovelli, Speziale, Baratin, Perini,\nFairbairn, Bianchi, and Kaminski in this volume. Transition amplitudes from path integrals\ncan be used to restrict the choice of the Hamiltonian constraint operator in the canonical\ntheory. This is a very promising direction and Freidel, Noui, Perez, Rovelli and others have\nanalyzed this issue especially in 2+1 dimensions. The idea in the fourth approach, due to\nVaradarajan, Laddha, Henderson, Tomlin and others, is to use insights gained from the\nanalysis of parameterized field theories. Now the emphasis is on drastically reducing the\nlarge freedom in the choice of the definition of the Hamiltonian constraint by requiring that\nthe quantum constraint algebra closes, so that one is assured that there is no obstruction to\nobtaining a large number of simultaneous solutions to all constraints. Because the Poisson\nbracket between two Hamiltonian constraints is a diffeomorphism constraint, one has to find\na viable expression of the operator generating infinitesimal diffeomorphisms. (Until this\nwork, the focus was on the action only of finite diffeomorphisms in the kinematical setup.)\nVery recently, this program has witnessed promising advances. The Hamiltonian constraint\none is led to define shares qualitative features of 'improved dynamics' of loop quantum\ncosmology that lies at the foundation of the most significant advances in that area.\nIn this discussion I have focused primarily on pure gravity. In the mid 1990s Brown,\n\n\f18\nKucha\u0159 and Romano had introduced frameworks in which matter fields can be used as\n'rods and clocks' thereby providing a natural 'de-parametrization' of the constraints in the\nclassical theory. Giesel, Thiemann, Tamburino, Domagala, Kaminski, Lewandowski, Husain\nand Pawlowski have used these considerations as the point of departure to construct loop\nquantum gravity theories for these systems. Deparametrization greatly facilitates the task\nof finding Dirac observables and makes it easier to interpret the quantum theory. However,\nas in the Master Constraint program, issues associated with quantization ambiguities still\nremain and there is the domain on which matter fields serve as good clocks and rods still\nneeds to be clarified. Further details can be found in the lectures by Giesel and Salhmann.\n\u2022 Spin foams: Four different avenues to quantum gravity have been used to arrive at\nspin-foam models (SFMs). The fact that ideas from seemingly unrelated directions converge\nto the same type of structures and models has provided a strong impetus to the spin foam\nprogram. Indeed, currently this is the most active area on the mathematical physics side of\nloop quantum gravity.\nThe first avenue is the Hamiltonian approach to loop quantum gravity [38, 39, 45]. By\nmimicking the procedure that led Feynman [1] to a sum over histories formulation of quantum\nmechanics, Rovelli and Reisenberger proposed a space-time formulation of this theory. This\nwork launched the spin-foam program. The second route stems from the fact that the\nstarting point in canonical loop quantum gravity is a rewriting of classical general relativity\nthat emphasizes connections over metrics [38]. Therefore in the passage to quantum theory\nit is natural to begin with the path integral formulation of appropriate gauge theories.\nA particularly natural candidate is the topological B-F theory because in 3 space-time\ndimensions it is equivalent to Einstein gravity, and in higher dimensions general relativity\ncan be regarded as a constrained BF theory [32, 35]. The well-controlled path integral\nformulation of the BF theory provided the second avenue and led to the SFM of Barrett\nand Crane.\nThe third route comes from the Ponzano-Regge model of 3-dimensional gravity that inspired Regge calculus in higher dimensions. Here one begins with a simplicial decomposition\nof the space-time manifold, describes its discrete Riemannian geometry using edge lengths\nand deficit angles and constructs a path integral in terms of them. If one uses holonomies\nand discrete areas of loop quantum gravity in place of edge lengths, one is again led to a\nspin foam. These three routes are inspired by various aspects of general relativity. The\nfourth avenue starts from approaches to quantum gravity in which gravity is to emerge from\na more fundamental theory based on abstract structures that, to begin with, have nothing\nto do with space-time geometry. Examples are matrix models for 2-dimensional gravity and\ntheir extension to 3-dimensions -the Boulatov model - where the basic object is a field\non a group manifold rather than a matrix. The Boulatov model was further generalized to\na group field theory tailored to 4-dimensional gravity [39, 48]. The perturbative expansion\nof this group field theory turned out be very closely related to 'vertex expansions' in SFMs.\nThus the SFMs lie at a junction where four apparently distinct paths to quantum gravity\nmeet. Through contributions of many researchers it has now become an active research area\n(see, e.g., [35, 39]).\nFour years ago, two groups, Engle-Livine-Pereira-Rovelli, and Freidel-Krasnov, put forward precise proposals for the sum over quantum geometries that could provide detailed\ndynamics in loop quantum gravity. The motivations were different but for the physically\ninteresting values of the Babero-Immirzi parameter (selected, e.g., by the black hole en-\n\n\f19\ntropy considerations), the two proposals agree. This is an improvement over the earlier\nBarrett-Crane model which cured some of the problems faced by that model. Perhaps more\nimportantly, thanks to the generalizations by Kaminski, Kisielowski and Lewandowski, the\ncanonical and path integral approaches have been brought closer to one another: they use\nthe same kinematics. However, there does not yet exit a systematic 'derivation' leading to\nthis proposal starting from classical general relativity, say, along the lines used in textbooks\nto arrive at the path integral formulation of gauge theories. Nonetheless the program has\nattracted a large number of researchers because: i) there do exist semi-heuristic considerations motivating the passage; ii) as I indicated above, it can be arrived at from four different\navenues; and iii) Detailed asymptotic analysis by Barrett, Hellmann, Dowdall, Fairbairn,\nPereira and others strongly indicates that these models have the correct classical limit; and,\niv) Because of the use of quantum geometry -more precisely because there is a non-zero\narea gap- this sum over quantum geometries has no ultra-violet divergences. More recently,\nFairbairn, Meusberger, Han and others have extended these considerations to include a cosmological constant by a natural use of quantum groups. It is then argued that, for a given\n2-simplex, the sum is also infra-red finite.\nHowever, the issue of whether to sum over distinct 2-complexes or to take an appropriate\n'continuum limit' is still debated and it is not known whether the final result would be finite\nin either case.10 In the cosmological mini-superspaces, the situation is well-controlled: under\na single assumption that a sum and an integral can be interchanged, the analog of the sum\nover 2-complexes (called the vertex expansion in the spin foam literature) has been shown\nto converge, and furthermore, converge to the 'correct' result that is already known from a\nwell-established Hamiltonian theory [54].\nA much more detailed discussion of spin foams can be found in the lectures by Rovelli,\nSpeziale, Baratin, Perini, Fairbairn, Bianchi, and Kaminski at this school.\nC.\n\nChallenges and Opportunities\n\nDevelopments summarized so far should suffice to provide a sense of the extent to which\nadvances in loop quantum gravity already provide an avenue to a non-perturbative and\nbackground independent formulation of quantum gravity. I will conclude by providing an\nillustrative list of the open issues. Some of these are currently driving the field while others\nprovide challenges and opportunities for further work. This discussion assumes that the\nreader is familiar with basic ideas behind current research in loop quantum gravity.\n1.\n\nFoundations\n\n\u2022 Hamiltonian Theory: In section II B I outlined four strategies that are being used to\nextract quantum dynamics. I will now sketch another avenue, inspired in part by the success\nof loop quantum cosmology, that has been proposed by Domagala, Giesel, Kaminski and\nLewandowski. In loop quantum cosmology, a massless scalar field often serves as an 'internal\nclock' with respect to which observables of physical interest evolve [54]. The idea is to take\n10\n\nMathematically, this situation is somewhat reminiscent to perturbative super-string theory, where there\nis evidence that each term in the expansion is finite but the sum is not controlled.\n\n\f20\nover this strategy to full quantum gravity by focusing on general relativity coupled with\na massless scalar field. This is a particularly interesting system because, already in the\n1990s, Kucha\u0159 and Romano showed that one can rearrange the constraints of this system so\nthat they form a true Lie algebra, where the Hamiltonian constraints Poisson commute with\neach other on the entire phase space. Interestingly, under seemingly mild assumptions one\ncan show that solutions of this system admit space-like foliations on which \u03c6 is constant.\nConsequently, even though the system has infinitely many degrees of freedom, as in LQC\none can use \u03c6 as a relational time variable. With T3 spatial topology for definiteness, one\ncan decompose all fields into homogeneous and purely inhomogeneous modes. If one were\nto truncate the system by setting the inhomogeneous modes to zero, the resulting quantum\ntheory would be precisely the loop quantum cosmology of Bianchi I models that has been\nanalyzed in detail by Ashtekar and Wilson-Ewing. One might imagine incorporating the\ninhomogeneous modes using the 'hybrid' quantization scheme that has been successfully\nused in the Gowdy models by Mena, Martin-Benito, Pawlowski and others, although it\nwill have to be non-trivially generalized to handle the fact that there are no Killing fields.\nAs in the Gowdy models, this will likely involve some gauge fixing of the diffeomorphism\nand Gauss constraints. Even if these gauge fixing strategies do not work globally on the full\nphase space, one should still obtain a quantum theory tailored to a 'non-linear neighborhood'\nof FLRW or Bianchi I space-times. Finally, effective equations for this system would also\nprovide valuable insights into the singularity resolution (which we expect to persist in an\nappropriate, well-defined sense). In particular, one would be able to compare and contrast\ntheir prediction with the simple BKL behavior near the general relativistic singularity, found\nby Andersson and Rendall for this system. More generally, this analysis will enable one to\nplace loop quantum cosmology in the setting of full loop quantum gravity.\nA second important open issue is to find restrictions on matter fields and their couplings\nto gravity for which this non-perturbative quantization can be carried out to a satisfactory\nconclusion. Supersymmetry, for example, is known to allow only very specific matter\ncontent. Recent work by Bodendorfer, Thiemann and Thurn has opened a fresh window\nfor this analysis. A second possibility is suggested by the analysis of the closure of the\nconstraint algebra in quantum theory. When it is extended to allow for matter couplings,\nthe recent work by Varadarajan, Laddha, and Tomlin referred to in sectionII B could\nprovide a promising approach to explore this issue in detail. Finally, as mentioned in section\nI A, the renormalization group approach has provided interesting hints. Specifically, Reuter\net al have presented significant evidence for a non-trivial fixed point for vacuum general\nrelativity in 4 dimensions [47]. When matter sources are included, it continues to exist\nonly when the matter content and couplings are suitably restricted. For scalar fields, in\nparticular, Percacci and Perini have found that polynomial couplings (beyond the quadratic\nterm in the action) are ruled out, an intriguing result that may 'explain' the triviality of\nsuch theories in Minkowski space-times [42]. Are there similar constraints coming from loop\nquantum gravity?\n\u2022 Spin foams: As discussed in section II B, the spin foam program has made significant\nadvances over the last four years. Results on the classical limit and finiteness of the sum over\nhistories for a fixed 2-complex are especially encouraging. Therefore it is now appropriate\nto invest time and effort on key foundational issues.\nFirst, we need a better understanding of the physical meaning of the 'vertex expansion'\nthat results when one sums over arbitrary 2-complexes. In particular, is there a systematic\n\n\f21\nphysical approximation that lets us terminate the sum after a finite number of terms? In\ngroup field theory each term is multiplied by a power of the coupling constant [39, 48] but\nthe physical meaning of this coupling constant in space-time terms is not known. Analysis by Ashtekar, Campiglia and Henderson in the cosmological context bears out an early\nsuggestion of Oriti that the coupling constant is related to the cosmological constant. In\nthe full theory, Fairbairn, Meusberger, Han and others have shown that the cosmological\nconstant can be incorporated using quantum groups (which also makes the spin foam sum\ninfrared finite for a fixed 2-complex). It is then natural to ask if there is a precise sense in\ninterpreting the vertex expansion as a perturbation series in a parameter physically related\nto the cosmological constant also in the full theory.\nSecond, as I mentioned in section II B, the issue of whether one should actually sum over\nvarious 2-complexes (i.e., add up all terms in the vertex expansion), or take an appropriately\ndefined continuum limit is still open. Rovelli and Smerlak have argued that there is a precise\nsense in which the two procedures coincide. But so far there is no control over the sum and\nexperts in rigorous field theory have expressed the concern that, unless a new principle\nis invoked, the number of terms may grow uncontrollably as one increases the number of\nvertices. Recent work on group field theory by Oriti, Rivasseau, Gurau, Krajewski and\nothers may help streamline this analysis and provide the necessary mathematical control.\nFinally, because the EPRL and FK models are motivated from the BF theory, they\ninherit certain ('Plebanski') sectors which classically do not correspond to general relativity.\nIn addition, analysis of cosmological spin foams re-enforces an early idea due to Oriti that\none should only sum over 'time oriented' quantum geometries. Some of these issues are\nnow being analyzed in detail by Engle and others. But more work is needed on these basic\nconceptual issues.\n\u2022 Low energy physics: In low energy physics one uses quantum field theory on given\nbackground space-times. Therefore one is naturally led to ask if this theory can be arrived\nat by starting from loop quantum gravity and making systematic approximations. Here, a\nnumber of interesting challenges appear to be within reach. Fock states have been isolated\nin the polymer framework [38] and elements of quantum field theory on quantum geometry\nhave been introduced [45]. These developments lead to concrete questions. For example, in\nquantum field theory in flat space-times, the Hamiltonian and other operators are regularized\nthrough normal ordering. For quantum field theory on quantum geometry, on the other\nhand, the Hamiltonians are expected to be manifestly finite [38, 45]. Can one then show\nthat, in a suitable approximation, normal ordered operators in the Minkowski continuum\narise naturally from these finite operators? Can one 'explain' why the so-called Hadamard\nstates of quantum field theory in curved space-times are special? These considerations could\nalso provide valuable hints for the construction of viable semi-classical states of quantum\ngeometry.\nSince quantum field theory in FLRW space-times plays such an important role in the\nphysics of the early universe, it is especially important to know if can be systematically\nderived from loop quantum gravity. A number of obstacles immediately come to mind. In\nthe standard treatment of quantum fields on cosmological space-times, one typically works\nwith conformal or proper time, makes a heavy use of the causal structure made available\nby the fixed background space-time, and discusses dynamics as an unitary evolution in the\nchosen time variable. In quantum geometry state of loop quantum cosmology, none of these\nstructures are available. Even in the 'deparameterized picture' it is a scalar field that plays\n\n\f22\nthe role of internal time; proper and conformal times are at best operators. Even when\nthe quantum state is sharply peaked on an effective solution, we have only a probability\ndistribution for various space-time geometries; we do not have a single, well-defined, classical\ncausal structure. Finally, in loop quantum gravity, dynamics is teased out of the constraint\nwhile in quantum field theory in curved space-times it is dictated by a Hamiltonian. These\nobstacles seem formidable at first, Ashtekar, Kaminski and Lewandowski have shown that\nthey can be overcome if one works with spatially compact topology and focuses just on\na finite number of modes of the test field. The first assumption frees one from infra-red\nissues which can be faced later while the second restriction was motivated by the fact that,\nin the inflationary scenario, only a finite number of modes of perturbations are relevant to\nobservations. It is important to remove these restrictions and use the resulting framework to\nanalyze the questions on the quantum gravity origin of Hadamard states and of the adiabatic\nregularization procedure routinely used in cosmology.\n2.\n\nApplications\n\n\u2022 The very early universe: Because the initial motivations for inflation are not as strong\nas they are often portrayed to be, several prominent relativists were put off by the idea.\nAs a consequence, recent developments in the inflationary paradigm have not drawn due\nattention in general relativity circles. In my view, there is a compelling case to take the\nparadigm seriously: it predicted the main features of inhomogeneities in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) which were subsequently observed and which serve as seeds for\nstructure formation.\nLet me first explain this point in some detail. Note first that one analyzes CMB inhomogeneities in terms of their Fourier modes and observationally relevant wave numbers are in\na finite range, say \u2206k. Using this fact, we can write down the four assumptions on which\nthe inflationary scenario is based:\n1) Some time in its very early history, the universe underwent a phase of accelerated expansion during which the Hubble parameter H was nearly constant.\n2) During this phase the universe is well-described by a FLRW background space-time together with linear perturbations.\n3) A few e-foldings before the longest wave length mode in the family \u2206k under consideration\nexited the Hubble radius, these Fourier modes of quantum fields describing perturbations\nwere in the Bunch-Davis vacuum.\n4) Soon after a mode exited the Hubble radius, its quantum fluctuation can be regarded as\na classical perturbation and evolved via linearized Einstein's equations.\nThen QFT on FLRW space-times and classical general relativity imply the existence of\ntiny inhomogeneities in CMB which have been seen by the 7 year WMAP data. Numerical\nsimulations show that these seeds grow to yield the large scale structure that is observed\ntoday. Although the assumptions are by no means compelling, the overall economy of\nthought it is nonetheless impressive. In particular, in this paradigm, the origin of the large\nscale structure of the universe lies just in vacuum fluctuations! Therefore, it is of considerable\ninterest to attempt to provide a quantum gravity completion of this paradigm.\nThe issues that are left open by this standard paradigm are of two types: Particle Physics\nissues and Quantum Gravity issues. Let me focus on the second for now:\n1) Initial singularity: The paradigm assumes classical general relativity and theorems due\nto Borde, Guth and Vilenkin then imply that space-time had an initial big bang singularity.\n\n\f23\nFor reasons discussed in section I, this is an artifact of using general relativity in domains\nwhere it is not applicable. Therefore, one needs a viable treatment of the Planck regime and\nthe corresponding extension of the inflationary paradigm.\n2) Probability of inflation: In loop quantum cosmology, the big bang is replaced by a quantum bounce. So it is natural to introduce initial conditions there. Will a generic homogeneous, isotropic initial state for the background, when evolved, encounter a phase of slow\nroll inflation compatible with the seven year WMAP data?\n3) Trans-Planckian issues: In classical general relativity, if we evolve the Fourier modes of\ninterest back in time, they become trans-Planckian. We need a quantum field theory on\nquantum cosmological space-times to adequately handle them.\n4) Observations: The question then is whether the initial quantum state at the bounce,\nwhen evolved forward in time agrees sufficiently with the Bunch Davis vacuum at the onset of inflation so as not to contradict the observations. More importantly, are there small\ndeviations which could be observed in future missions?\nRecent work by Ashtekar, Sloan, Agullo, Nelson and Barreau, Cailleteau, Grain and\nMielczarek has made notable advances in facing these questions [54] but there are ample\nopportunities for other research that will provide both a viable quantum gravity completion\nof the inflationary paradigm and potentially observable predictions.\nFinally, even if loop quantum gravity does offer a viable quantum gravity completion\nof the inflationary paradigm, open issues related to particle physics will still remain. In\nparticular: What is the physical origin of the inflaton field? Of the potential one must\nuse to get a sufficiently long slow roll? Is there only one inflaton or many? If many,\nwhat are their interaction? What are the couplings that produce the known particles\nas the inflaton oscillates around the minimum of the potential at the end of inflation\n(the so-called 'reheating')? Therefore, it would be healthy to look also for alternatives\nto inflation. Indeed, in the alternatives that have been advocated by Barndenberger\nand others involve bouncing models and therefore have similarities with the general loop\nquantum cosmology paradigm. Because the expansion of the universe from the bounce to\nthe surface of last scattering in the post-bounce branch is much smaller than that in the\ninflationary scenario, at the bounce, modes of direct interest to the CMB observations now\nhave physical frequencies much below the Planck scale. Therefore, the trans-Planckian\nissue is avoided and quantum field theory in curved space-times should be viable for these\nmodes. This fact, coupled with the absence of singularity, enables one to calculate a transfer\nmatrix relating modes in the pre-bounce epoch to those in the post-bounce epoch. Under\nsuitable assumptions, Brandenberger and others have shown that this relation gives rise\nto a nearly scale invariant spectrum of scalar and tensor modes in the post-bounce phase.\nBut the underlying premise in these calculations is that perturbations originate in the\ndistant past of the contracting branch where the geometry is nearly flat and quantum fields\nrepresenting perturbations are taken to be in their vacuum state. This idea that the entire\nevolution from the distant past in the contracting phase to the bounce is well described by\na homogeneous model with small perturbations is not at all realistic. But since the general\nparadigm has several attractive features, it would be of considerable interest to investigate\nwhether loop quantum cosmology bounces allow similar alternatives to inflation without having to assume that non-linearities can be neglected throughout the pre-bounce phase.\n\u2022 Black hole evaporation: The issue of the final state: Black hole thermodynamics was\ninitially developed in the context of stationary black holes.

Quantum\nspace-time is larger and the incoming information on the full I \u2212 is adequately recovered on the\nI \u2212 of this larger space-time.\n\nthere were very few analytical results on dynamical black holes in classical general relativity.\nThis changed with the advent of dynamical horizons which provide the necessary analytical\ntools to extract physics from numerical simulations of black hole formation and evaporation.\nIt also led to some new insights on the fundamental side. in particular, it was also shown that\nthe first law can be extended to these time-dependent situations and the leading term in the\nexpression of the entropy is again given by ahor /4l2Pl [41]. Hawking radiation will cause the\nhorizon of a large black hole to shrink very slowly, whence it is reasonable to expect that the\ndescription of the quantum horizon geometry can be extended from isolated to dynamical\nhorizons in this phase of the evaporation. The natural question then is: Can one describe\nin detail the black hole evaporation process and shed light on the issue of information loss?\nThe space-time diagram of the evaporating black hole, conjectured by Hawking, is shown\nin the left-hand drawing in Fig. 1. It is based on two ingredients: i) Hawking's original\ncalculation of black hole radiance, in the framework of quantum field theory on a fixed\nbackground space-time; and ii) heuristics of back-reaction effects which suggest that the\nradius of the event horizon must shrink to zero. It is generally argued that the semi-classical\nprocess depicted in this figure should be reliable until the very late stages of evaporation when\nthe black hole has shrunk to Planck size and quantum gravity effects become important.\nSince it takes a very long time for a large black hole to shrink to this size, one then argues\nthat the quantum gravity effects during the last stages of evaporation will not be sufficient\nto restore the correlations that have been lost due to thermal radiation over such a long\nperiod. Thus there is loss of information. Intuitively, the lost information is 'absorbed' by\nthe 'left-over piece' of the final singularity which serves as a new boundary to space-time.\nHowever, loop quantum gravity considerations suggest that this argument is incorrect\n\n\f25\nin two respects. First, the semi-classical picture breaks down not just at the end point\nof evaporation but in fact all along what is depicted as the final singularity. Using ideas\nfrom quantum cosmology, the interior of the Schwarzschild horizon was analyzed in the\ncontext of loop quantum gravity by Ashtekar, Bojowald, Modesto, Vandersloot and others.\nThis analysis is not as complete or refined as that in the cosmological context. But the\nqualitative conclusion that the singularity is resolved due to quantum geometry effects is\nlikely to be robust. If so, the space-time does not have a singularity as its final boundary.\nThe second limitation of this semi-classical picture is its depiction of the event horizon. The\nnotion of an event horizon is teleological and refers to the global structure of space-time.\nResolution of the singularity introduces a domain in which there is no classical space-time,\nwhence the notion ceases to be meaningful; it is simply 'transcended' in quantum theory.\nUsing these considerations Ashtekar and Bojowald introduced a new paradigm for black hole\nevaporation in loop quantum gravity, depicted in the right hand drawing of Fig. 1: Now, it\nis the dynamical horizon that evaporates with emission of quantum radiation, and the initial\npure state evolves to a final pure state on the future null infinity of the extended space-time.\nThus, there is no information loss. In this paradigm, the semi-classical considerations would\nnot simply dismissed; they would be valid in certain space-time regions and under certain\napproximations. But for fundamental conceptual issues, they would not be inadequate.\nHowever, this is still only a paradigm and the main challenge is to develop it into a\ndetailed theory. Just as Wheeler's 'It from Bit' ideas were transformed into a detailed\ntheory of quantum horizon geometry, it should be possible to construct a detailed theory of\nblack hole evaporation based on this paradigm. More recently, this paradigm was put on a\nfirm footing by Ashtekar, Taveras and Varadarajan in the case of 2-dimensional black holes\nfirst introduced by Callen, Giddings, Harvey and Strominger. The model is interesting\nespecially because its action and equations of motion closely mimic those governing\n4-dimensional, spherically symmetric black holes formed by the gravitational collapse of a\nscalar field. Ashtekar, Pretorius and Ramazanoglu have used a combination of analytical\nand numerical methods to analyze the mean field approximation in complete detail. It\nexplicitly shows that some of the common assumptions regarding effects of including back\nreaction, discussed in the last paragraph, are incorrect. This analysis further reinforces the\nparadigm of the figure on the right. It is therefore of considerable interest to extend all\nthis analysis to four dimensions in the loop quantum gravity setting. The very considerable\nwork on spherically symmetric midi-superspaces by Gambini, Pullin, Bojowald and others\nwill serve as a point of departure for this analysis.\n\u2022 Contact with low energy physics: Spin foam models provide a convenient arena to\ndiscuss issues such as the graviton propagator, n point functions and scattering, that lie at\nthe heart of perturbative treatments. At first, it seems impossible to have non-trivial n-point\nfunctions in a diffeomorphism invariant theory. Indeed, how could one say that the 2-point\nfunction falls off as 1/r n when the distance r between the two points has no diffeomorphism\ninvariant meaning? Thanks to a careful conceptual set-up by Oeckl, Colosi, Rovelli and\nothers, this issue has been satisfactorily resolved. To speak of n-point functions, one needs\nto introduce a boundary state (in which the expectation values are taken) and the notion\nof distance r descends from the boundary state. Interestingly, a detailed calculation of the\n2-point function brought out some limitations of the Barrett-Crane model and provided\nnew impetus for the EPRL and FK models. As Perini's talks at this school showed, these\ncalculations by Bianchi, Ding, Magliaro and Perini strongly indicate that, to the leading\n\n\f26\norder, a graviton propagator with the correct functional form and tensorial structure will\narise from these models.\nHowever, these calculations can be improved in a number of respects and their full\nimplications have yet to be properly digested. In particular, one needs a better handle\non contributions from 2-complexes with large numbers of vertices and the physics of the\nsub-leading terms. These terms seem to be sensitive to the choice of the boundary state\nand there isn't a canonical one representing Minkowski space. Therefore, comparison with\nthe standard perturbation theory in Minkowski space is difficult. This is a fertile and\nimportant area for further research. Indeed the key challenge in this area is to 'explain'\nwhy perturbative quantum general relativity fails if the theory exists non-perturbatively.\nAs mentioned in section I, heuristically the failure can be traced back to the insistence\nthat the continuum space-time geometry is a good approximation even below the Planck\nscale. But a more detailed answer is needed. For example, is it because, as developments\nin the asymptotically safe scenarios indicate [47, 52], the renormalization group has a\nnon-Gaussian fixed point?\n\u2022 Unification. Finally, there is the issue of unification. At a kinematical level, there is\nalready an unification because the quantum configuration space of general relativity is the\nsame as in gauge theories which govern the strong and electro-weak interactions. But the\nnon-trivial issue is that of dynamics. To conclude, let us consider a speculation. One possibility is to use the 'emergent phenomena' scenario where new degrees of freedom or particles,\nwhich were not present in the initial Lagrangian, emerge when one considers excitations of\na non-trivial vacuum. For example, one can begin with solids and arrive at phonons; start\nwith superfluids and find rotons; consider superconductors and discover cooper pairs. In\nloop quantum gravity, the micro-state representing Minkowski space-time will have a highly\nnon-trivial Planck-scale structure. The basic entities will be 1-dimensional and polymerlike. one can argue that, even in absence of a detailed theory, the fluctuations of these\n1-dimensional entities should correspond not only to gravitons but also to other particles,\nincluding a spin-1 particle, a scalar and an anti-symmetric tensor. These 'emergent states'\nare likely to play an important role in Minkowskian physics derived from loop quantum\ngravity. A detailed study of these excitations may well lead to interesting dynamics that\nincludes not only gravity but also a select family of non-gravitational fields. It may also\nserve as a bridge between loop quantum gravity and string theory. For, string theory has\ntwo a priori elements: unexcited strings which carry no quantum numbers and a background\nspace-time. Loop quantum gravity suggests that both could arise from the quantum state\nof geometry, peaked at Minkowski (or, de Sitter) space. The polymer-like quantum threads\nwhich must be woven to create the classical ground state geometries could be interpreted\nas unexcited strings. Excitations of these strings, in turn, may provide interesting matter\ncouplings for loop quantum gravity.\n3.\n\nSome Final Remarks\n\nFrom examples discussed in this section it is clear that loop quantum gravity has witnessed significant advances over the last decade, both in its foundations and applications. It\nis therefore important for the community to make sustained progress on directions that have\nalready been opened up. Of course one constantly needs an influx of new ideas. But it would\nbe a mistake if a significant fraction of the community focuses on constructing new models\n\n\f27\nevery few months, making a first stab and then passing on to the next model. The cumulative results in the main stream development of loop quantum gravity now carry sufficient\nweight for us to take the basic ideas seriously and continue to develop them by attacking the\nhard conceptual and technical open issues. Examples of such issues are: Finding principles\nand strategies to significantly narrow the ambiguities in the definition of the Hamiltonian\nconstraint; exploring the role of supersymmetry; sharpening the set of quantum geometries\nto sum over, and addressing the problem of convergence in spin foam models; analyzing\nthe renormalization group flows in group field theory; understanding the dependence of\nthe n-point functions on the choice of the boundary state; developing approximation methods to calculate S-matrix from spin foams and pin-pointing why the standard perturbative\ntreatments fail; fully incorporating matter fields in spin foams, particularly scalar fields;\nconstructing effective field theories to adequately describe low energy physics; finding the\ndetailed relation between loop quantum gravity and loop quantum cosmology; constructing\na detailed completion of the inflationary paradigm in the Planck regime; exploring its observable consequences in the very early universe; ... The list is long enough to keep young\nresearchers busy and happy for quite a while! Furthermore, in this work, it is important to\nkeep focus on physical issues and try to solve problems of direct physical interest. Developing\nformalism is important because it streamlines the ideas and procedures. But it is not an end\nin itself. Indeed, it is of little use unless it leads to answers to the long standing physical\nquestions.\nFinally, there is a complementary direction. Because the mathematics underlying loop\nquantum gravity is rigorous, the subject is now begun to make inroads into other areas\nof mathematical physics and mathematics itself. For example, there is now literature on\nspin networks, quantum topology and computing, spin foams and non commuting geometry,\nHolst action and asymptotic safety, loop quantum gravity and topos theory, spectral triples\nover the space of generalized connections etc. from researchers like Kauffmann, Marcolli,\nReuter, Dahlen, Aastrup and Grimstrup from outside the traditional loop quantum gravity community. Conversely, some loop quantum gravity researchers such as Ma, Gambini,\nPullin, Singh, Dittrich, Freidel and Fleischhack are applying techniques developed in the\nfield to other areas such as the f (R) theories that rose to prominence in cosmology, generalized quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, non-commutative geometry, gauge theories\nand geometry. Thus there is ample evidence that the subject is now sufficiently mature to\nhave applications to other areas. In these explorations, it is important to focus on problems\nthat other communities consider as important in their areas. In my view, this 'outward\nbound' spirit is the second pillar on which further development of the field will rest.\nAcknowledgements:\n\nMy understanding of classical and quantum gravity has deepened through discussions\nwith a large number of colleagues; many of whom were at the Zakopane School.
