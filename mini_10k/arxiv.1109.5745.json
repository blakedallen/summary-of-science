An\nexplicit inner product is defined on each representation. The frequency\nspectrum of each of these representations is analyzed.

By steady\nstate we mean those solutions that extend to the conformal compactification of Minkowski space. That is, we look upon the solutions of Maxwell's\nequations as tensor valued on\nR4 with the flat Lorentzian metric given by\n\u2212dx21 \u2212 dx22 \u2212 dx23 + dt2 ,\nKey words and phrases: Maxwell's equations, conformal compactification, conformal\ngroup, unitary representation\nMSC 2010 : 78A25, 58Z05, 22E70, 22E45.\nResearch partially supported by NSF grant DMS 0963035.\n\n1\n\n\fwhere x1 , x2 , x3 and x4 = t yield the standard coordinates of R4 . R4 with\nthis metric will be denoted by R1,3 . The conformal compactification is the\nspace S 3 \u00d7{\u00b11} S 1 (modulo the product action of \u00b11) with (up to a positive\nscalar multiple on both factors) the product metric with the negative of the\nconstant curvature 1 metric on S 3 and the usual metric on S 1 . The injection,\nf , of R4 into S 3 \u00d7{\u00b11} S 1 is the inverse of a variant of stereographic projection\n(see Section 2). This embedding is not an isometry, but it is conformal. Our\napproach to Maxwell's equations uses the equivalent formulation in terms\nof differential 2-forms on Minkowski space. More generally, if (M, g) is an\noriented Lorentzian four manifold (signature (\u2212, \u2212, \u2212, +)) and if \" \u2217 \" denotes the Hodge star operator on 2-forms relative to the volume form, \u03b3,\nwith g(\u03b3, \u03b3) = \u22121, then there is a version of Maxwell's equations on \u03a92 (M)\n(differential two forms) given by\nd\u03c9 = d \u2217 \u03c9 = 0.\nLet M and N be four-dimensional Lorentzian manifolds, let F : M \u2192 N be\na conformal transformation, and let \u03c9 be a solution to Maxwell's equations\non N. Then F \u2217 \u03c9 is a solution to Maxwell's equations on M. Since f is\nconformal we see that the pullback of solutions to Maxwell's equations on\nS 3 \u00d7{\u00b11} S 1 yields solutions to the usual Maxwell equations.\nThe group of conformal transformations of S 3 \u00d7{\u00b11} S 1 is locally the group\nSO(4, 2) and thus the solutions to Maxwell's equations on S 3 \u00d7{\u00b11} S 1 form\na representation of this group. We can interpret this as follows: We first note\nthat we can replace S 3 \u00d7{\u00b11} S 1 with the group U(2). If on Lie(U(2)) we put\nthe Lorentzian form that corresponds to the quadratic form \u2212 det X, then the\ncorresponding bi-invariant metric on a U(2) is isometric, up to positive scalar\nmultiple, with S 3 \u00d7{\u00b11} S 1 . We interpret this space as the Shilov boundary\nof the Hermitian symmetric space that corresponds to G = SU(2, 2) (which\nis locally isomorphic with SO(4, 2)).\nWe denote by Maxw the space of solutions in \u03a92 (U(2)) to Maxwell's\nequations. We show that there is a canonical nondegenerate G-invariant\nHermitian form on Maxw. Further, we show that as a smooth Fr\u00e9chet representation of G, Maxw splits into the direct sum of four irreducible (Fr\u00e9chet)\nrepresentations (of moderate growth) that are mutually orthogonal relative\nto the form. This form is positive definite on two of the irreducible pieces\nand negative definite on the other two. Since the K = S(U(2) \u00d7 U(2)) isotypic components of Maxw are all finite dimensional we see that this yields\n2\n\n\ffour unitary irreducible representations of G. Two of the representations\nare holomorphic (negative energy in the physics literature) and two are antiholomorphic (positive energy). We also describe them in terms of the Aq (\u03bb)\nthat yield second continuous cohomology (the four theta stable parabolics q involved relate these representations to twister theory) and in terms\nof quaternionic representations (SU(2, 2) is the quaternionic real form of\nSL(4, C)). These representations are actually representations of P SU(2, 2).\nIn this group there is a dual pair P SU(1, 1), SO(3) establishing an analogue\nof Howe duality in each of the four representations. The realization of these\nrepresentations is intimately related to the work in [K].We use the decomposition of the restriction of these representations to P SU(1, 1) to analyze the\nfrequency distribution of the solutions in each of the P SU(2, 2) representations.\nWe interpret the plane wave solutions as generalized Whittaker vectors\non Maxw and the solutions as wave packets of the Whittaker vectors. These\nwave packets have constrained frequency spectrum and using Planck's black\nbody radiation law the frequency limitation and luminosity of the corresponding radiation determines the temperature to narrow constraints. This\nmeans that we can fit our solutions to the measured background radiation on\na steady state universe. We make no assertions as to how such a steady state\nuniverse might physically exist. There are many suggestions in the literature\n(e.g., the work of Hoyle et al [HBN]). All seem complicated. However, we\nwill content ourselves to the assertion that the big bang is not necessarily\nthe only possible interpretation of background radiation.\nThere is also an interpretation of the red shift that can be gleaned from\nthis work involving the relationship between the measurement of time from\nthe proposed \"big bang\" and the steady state \"time\" which is periodic but\nwith a large period appearing to move faster as we look backwards or forwards\nin terms of \"standard\" time. (See [S].)\nWe are aware that many of the aspects of representation theory in this\npaper could have been done in more generality. We have constrained our\nattention to the four representations at hand since the main thrust of this\npaper is to show how representation theory can be used to study well-known\nequations in physics.\nParts of this work should be considered expository. Related work has been\ndone by [HSS] on the action of the conformal group on solutions of the wave\nequation and [EW] relating positive energy representations to generalized\nDirac equations.\n3\n\n\f2\n\nConformal compactification of Minkowski\nspace\n\nLet R1,3 denote R4 with the pseudo-Riemannian (Lorentzian) structure given\nby (x, y) = \u2212x1 y1 \u2212x2 y2 \u2212x3 y3 + x4 y4 . Here xi , i = 1, 2, 3, 4, are the standard\ncoordinates on R4 and we identify the tangent space at every point with\nR4 . We can realize this space as the space of 2 \u00d7 2 Hermitian matrices\n(a 4-dimensional vector space over R), V , with the Lorentzian structure\ncorresponding to the quadratic form given by the determinant. Note that\n\u0015\n\u0014\nx4 + x3 x1 + ix2\n= (x, x).\ndet\nx1 \u2212 ix2 x4 \u2212 x3\nWe can also realize the space in terms of skew Hermitian matrices u(2) =\niV and noting that the form becomes \u2212 det. With this interpretation, and\nrealizing that u(2) = Lie(U(2)) we have an induced Lorentzian structure,\nh. . . , . . .i on U(2). We also have a transitive action of K = U(2) \u00d7 U(2) on\nU(2) by right and left translation\n(g1 , g2 )u = g1 ug2\u22121 .\nSince the isotropy group at I is M = diag(U(2)) = {(g, g)|g \u2208 U(2)}.We see\nthat K acts by isometries on U(2) with this structure.\nWe will now consider a much bigger group that acts. We first consider\nthe indefinite unitary group G \u223c\n= U(2, 2) given by the elements, g \u2208 M4 (C)\nsuch that\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n0\niI2\n0\niI2\n\u2217\ng\ng =\n.\n\u2212iI2 0\n\u2212iI2 0\n\nHere as usual g \u2217 means conjugate transpose. G \u2229 U(4) is the group of all\nmatrices of the 2 \u00d7 2 block form\n\u0014\n\u0015\nA B\n\u2212B A\nsatisfying AB \u2217 = BA\u2217 and AA\u2217 + BB \u2217 = I. These equations are equivalent\nto the condition\nA + iB \u2208 U(2).\nIt is easy to see that the map\n\n\u03a8 : G \u2229 U(4) \u2192 U(2) \u00d7 U(2)\n4\n\n\fgiven by\n\n\u0014\n\nA B\n\u2212B A\n\n\u0015\n\n7\u2192 (A \u2212 iB, A + iB)\n\ndefines a Lie group isomorphism. This leads to the action of G \u2229 U(4) on\nU(2) given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\nA B\n* x = (A \u2212 iB)x(A + iB)\u22121 .\n\u2212B A\nNote that the stabilizer of I2 is the subgroup isomorphic with M given by\nthe elements\n\u0015\n\u0014\nA 0\n, A \u2208 U(2).\n0 A\nWe extend this to a map of G to U(2) given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\nA B\n\u03a6:\n7 (A + iC)(A \u2212 iC)\u22121 .\n\u2192\nC D\n\u0014\n\u0015\nA B\nThis makes sense since A \u2212 iC is invertible if\n\u2208 G. We consider\nC D\nthe subgroup P of G that consists of the matrices\n\u0015\n\u0014\ng gX\n0 (g \u2217 )\u22121\nwith g \u2208 GL(2, C) and X \u2208 H (in other words, X \u2217 = X). Then every\nelement of G can be written in the form kp with k \u2208 G \u2229 U(4) and p \u2208 P .\nWe note that \u03a6(kp) = \u03a6(k) = k * I. Now, U(4) \u2229 K\u0014acts transitively\non G/P\n\u0015\nA 0\n, A \u2208 U(2). We\nand the stabilizer of the identity coset is the group\n0 A\nwill identify K with U(4) \u2229 G (under \u03a8) and M with the stabilizer of the\nidentity. Thus G/P = K/M.\nWe consider the subgroup N :\n\u0015\n\u0014\nI 0\n, Y \u2217 = Y.\nY I\nIf we write\n\n\u0014\n\nI\nY\n\n0\nI\n5\n\n\u0015\n\n= kp\n\n\fwith\nk=\nas above, then A \u2208 GL(2, C) and\n\n\u0014\n\nA B\n\u2212B A\n\n\u0015\n\n\u2212BA\u22121 = Y.\nOne can see that if we set\nk(Y ) =\n\n\"\n\n\u221a I\nI+Y 2\n\u221a Y\nI+Y 2\n\nthen\nk(Y )P =\n\n\u0014\n\nI\nY\n\nThis gives an embedding of H into U(2)\n\n\u221a \u2212Y\nI+Y 2\n\u221a I\nI+Y 2\n\n0\nI\n\n\u0015\n\n#\n\n,\n\nP.\n\nY 7\u2212\u2192 (I + iY )(I \u2212 iY )\u22121 ,\nthe Cayley transform. We next explain how this is related to the Cayley\ntransform in the sense of bounded symmetric domains.\nWe note that it is more usual to look upon G (in its more usual incarnation) as the group of all elements g \u2208 GL(4, C) such that\n\u0015\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0014\nI 0\nI 0\n\u2217\n.\ng =\ng\n0 \u2212I\n0 \u2212I\nLet us set G1 equal to this group. The relationship between the two groups\nis given as follows.

We get\ndQY (v) = iv(I \u2212 iY )\u22121 + (I + iY )(I \u2212 iY )\u22121 iv(I \u2212 iY )\u22121\n= i(I + iY )(I \u2212 iY )\u22121 ((I \u2212 iY )(I + iY )\u22121 + I)v(1 \u2212 iY )\u22121\n= 2iQ(Y )(I + iY )\u22121 v(1 \u2212 iY )\u22121 .\n\nThus\nhdQY (v), dQY (v)iQ(Y ) = 4\n\ndet(v)\n(v, v)Y\n=4\n.\n2\ndet(I + Y )\ndet(I + Y 2 )\n\nNow calculate det(I + Y 2 ) in terms of the xi .\nMore generally we have\nLemma 2 The action of G (or G1 ) on U(2) given by the linear fractional\ntransformations is conformal relative to the pseudo-Riemannian metric h. . . , . . .i\non U(2).\n7\n\n\fProof. Let\n\u03c6(Z) = g * Z = (AZ + B)(CZ + D)\u22121\nwith g \u2208 G1 . Then if X \u2208 u(2) we have\nd\u03c6Z (ZX) = (AZX \u2212 \u03c6(Z)CZX)(CZ + D)\u22121\n= \u03c6(Z)(\u03c6(Z)\u22121 AZX \u2212 CZX)(CZ + D)\u22121 .\nThus since \u2212 det X = hZX, ZXiZ we have hd\u03c6Z (ZX), d\u03c6Z (ZX)i\u03c6(Z) =\n\u0001\ndet (\u03c6(Z)\u22121AZ \u2212 CZ)(CZ + D)\u22121 hZX, ZXiZ .\n\nThis proves the conformality.\nWe note that\n\n(\u03c6(Z)\u22121 AZX \u2212 CZX)(CZ + D)\u22121\n= (CZ + D)((AZ + B)\u22121 AZ \u2212 (CZ + D)\u22121CZ)(CZ + D)\u22121 .\nThus the conformal factor is\ndet((AZ + B)\u22121 AZ \u2212 (CZ + D)\u22121 CZ)\n= det((AZ + B)\u22121 B \u2212 (CZ + D)\u22121 D).\n\n3\n\nMaxwell's equations on compactified\nMinkowski space\n\nWe will first recall Maxwell's equations in Lorentzian form. For this we need\nsome notation. If M is a smooth manifold, then \u03a9k (M) will denote the\nspace of smooth k-forms on M. We note that if (M, g) is an n-dimensional\npseudo-Riemannian manifold then g induces nondegenerate forms on each\nfiber \u2227k T (M)\u2217x which we will also denote as gx . If M is oriented then there\nis a unique element \u03b3 \u2208 \u03a9n (M) such that if x \u2208 M and v1 , . . . , vn is an\noriented pseudo-orthonormal basis of T (M)x (i.e., |gx (vi , vj )| = \u03b4ij ) then\n\u03b3x (v1 , . . . , vn ) = 1. Using \u03b3 we can define the Hodge \u2217 operator on M as\nfollows: If \u03c9 \u2208 \u2227k T (M)\u2217x , then \u2217\u03c9 is defined to be the unique element of\n\u2227n\u2212k T (M)\u2217x such that \u03b7 \u2227 \u2217\u03c9 = gx (\u03b7, \u03c9)\u03b3x for all \u03b7 \u2208 \u2227k T (M)\u2217x .\nThe next result is standard.\n8\n\n\fLemma 3 Let F : M \u2192 N be a conformal, orientation, preserving mapping\nof oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. If dim M = dim N = 2k then\nF \u2217 \u2217 \u03c9 = \u2217F \u2217\u03c9 for \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9k .\nWith this notation in place we can set up Maxwell's equations. Take\nt = x4 in R1,3 and let \u03c9 7\u2212\u2192 \u2217\u03c9 denote the Hodge star operator on differential\nforms with respect to the Lorentzian structure (. . . , . . .) and the orientation\ncorresponding to \u03b3 = dx1 \u2227 dx2 \u2227 dx3 \u2227 dt. Then Maxwell's equations in\nan area free of current (simple media e.g., in a vacuum, with the dielectric\nconstant, the permeability and thus the speed of light normalized to 1) can\nbe expressed in terms of 2-forms as\nd\u03c9 = d \u2217 \u03c9 = 0\n\n(1)\n\nwith d the exterior derivative. We note that in this formulation if E =\n(e1 , e2 , e3 ) and H =(h1 , h2 .h3 ) are respectively the electric field intensity and\nthe magnetic field intensity vectors, then\n\u03c9 = h1 dx2 \u2227 dx3 \u2212 h2 dx1 \u2227 dx3 + h3 dx1 \u2227 dx2\n\u2212e1 dx1 \u2227 dt \u2212 e2 dx2 \u2227 dt \u2212 e3 dx3 \u2227 dt.\nThe equations (1) are then the same as\n\u2207*E=\u2207*H=0\nand\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\nE = \u2212\u2207 \u00d7 H, H = \u2207 \u00d7 E.\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\nHere the \u2217 operation is just E \u2192 H and H \u2192 \u2212E, which is the duality\nbetween electricity and magnetism in the physics literature.\nWe note that if M = R1,3 and N = U(2) with the Lorentzian structures\ndescribed in the previous section, if F is the map described above and if\n\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a92 (U(2)) satisfies the equations (1), then F \u2217 \u03c9 satisfies Maxwell's equations on R1,3 . We will thus call the equations (1) Maxwell's equations on\ncompactified Minkowski space.\nThe group G (or G1 ) acts on U(2) by conformal diffeomorphisms. Thus we\nsee that the space of solutions to Maxwell's equations defines a representation\nof G.(which acts by pullback). Most of the rest of this article will be devoted\nto that analysis of this representation.\n9\n\n\fDenote by \u03a9k (U(2))C the complex valued k-forms. Endow it with the C \u221e topology which is a Fr\u00e9chet space structure and the corresponding action of\nG on \u03a92 (U(2)) defines it as a smooth Fr\u00e9chet representation of G moderate\ngrowth. To see this, we note that as a G-homogeneous space U(2) \u223c\n= G/P .\nLet \u03bc denote the isotropy action of P on V = TIP (G/P )C (i.e., the action of\nP on Lie(G)/ Lie(P ) \u2297 C). Then the space \u03a9k (U(2))C with the C \u221e topology\nand G action by pullback is just the C \u221e induced representation\nk \u2217 \u221e\nIndG\nP (\u2227 V ) .\n\nFurthermore, since it is as a K-representation\nk \u2217 \u221e\nIndK\nM (\u2227 V ) ,\n\nFrobenius reciprocity implies that the representation is admissible (that is,\nthe multiplicities of the K-types is finite). The maps d and d\u2217 are continuous\nmaps in this topology to \u03a93 (U(2))C ; thus the solutions of Maxwell's equations\non U(2) define an admissible, smooth Fr\u00e9chet representation of moderate\ngrowth.\n\n4\n\nThe K-isotypic components of the space\nof solutions to Maxwell's equations on\ncompactified Minkowski space: step 1\n\nIn this section we will begin determination of the K-isotypic components\nof the space of solutions to Maxwell's equations. We will proceed by first\ndetermining the isotypic components of ker d on \u03a92 (U(2))C . We will then use\nexplicit calculations for the case at hand of d and the Hodge star operator\nto complete the picture. We will now begin the first step.\nWe note that U(2) is diffeomorphic with SU(3) \u00d7 S 1 under the map\n\u0015\n\u0014\nz 0\nu, z 7\u2192 u\n0 1\nwith u \u2208 SU(2) and z \u2208 S 1 = {z \u2208 C||z| = 1}. We note that SU(2) is\ndiffeomorphic with S 3 which implies that we have\nH 1 (U(2), C) = C,\n10\n\n\fH 2 (U(2), C) = 0,\nand\nH 3 (U(2), C) = C.\nSo de Rham's theorem implies that we have the following short exact sequences\n0 \u2192 C1 \u2192 C \u221e (U(2), C) \u2192 ker d|\u03a91 (U (2))C \u2192 C\u03bc \u2192 0;\n\n(1)\n\n0 \u2192 ker d|\u03a91 (U (2)) \u2192 \u03a91 (U(2))C \u2192 ker d|\u03a92 (U (2))C \u2192 0\n\n(2)\n\nin both sequences the map to the kernel is given by d. Also \u03bc is the image\nof det\u2217 dz\nin the quotient space. These are all morphisms of smooth Fr\u00e9chet\nz\nrepresentations of G of moderate growth.\nWe also note that the center of G consists of the multiples of the identity\nand so acts trivially on U(2). Now K = U(2) \u00d7 U(2) and the multiples of\nthe identity correspond under this identification with the diagonal elements\nC = {(zI, zI)| |z| = 1} and M is the diagonal U(2) in K. The actual groups\nacting on U(2) are K/C and M/C. We define K1 = SU(2) \u00d7 U(2) and\nM1 = {(u, u)|u \u2208 SU(2)}. Then under the natural map K/M = K1 /M1\nwe still have a redundancy of \u03bc2 = {\u00b1(I, I)}. We will use the notation\n(\u03c4p,q,r , F (p,q,r)) for the representation of K1 on S p (C2 )\u2297S q (C2 ) (S p (C2 ) the pth\nsymmetric power) given by \u03c4p,q,r (u, vz) = z r S p (u) \u2297 S q (u) where p, q \u2208 Z\u22650 ,\nr \u2208 Z and r \u2261 q mod 2. If V is a closed K-invariant subspace of \u03a9k (U(2))C\nthen we denote by Vp,q,r its \u03c4p,q,r isotypic component.\nLemma 4 As a representation of K1 , the space of K1 -finite vectors of\nker d|\u03a92 (U (2))C splits into a direct sum\nM\n\nk\u22650\nr \u2261 k mod 2\n\n(F k+2,k,r \u2295 F k,k+2,r \u2295 F k+1,k+1,r ).\n\nFurthermore, if p \u2212 q 6= 0 then\nd : \u03a91 (U(2))p,q,r \u2192 (ker d|\u03a92(U (2))C )p,q,r\nis a bijective K-intertwining operator.\n\n11\n\n\fProof. The Peter\u2013Weyl theorem implies that L2 (U(2)) is a Hilbert space\ndirect sum\nM\nV \u03c4 \u2297 (V \u03c4 )\u2217 ,\n[\n\u03c4 \u2208U\n(2)\n\n[ is the set of equivalence classes of irreducible finite-dimensional\nwhere U(2)\nrepresentations of U(2) and V \u03c4 is a choice of representative of \u03c4 . We have\nthe exact sequence\n1 \u2192 {\u00b1(I, 1)} \u2192 SU(2) \u00d7 S 1 \u2192 U(2) \u2192 1\nwith the last map u, z 7\u2212\u2192 zu. This implies (as above) that if we define V p,r to\nbe the representation, \u03c4p,r of SU(2)\u00d7S 1 on S p (C2 ) with \u03c4p,r (u, z)v = z r S p (u)v,\nthen \u03c4p,r is the lift of an irreducible representation of U(2) if and only if\nr \u2261 p mod 2. These representations give a complete set of representatives\n[ We note that the dual representation of \u03c4p,r is equivalent with\nfor U(2).\n\u03c4p,\u2212r . We therefore see that the space of K-finite vectors in C \u221e (U(2))C is\nisomorphic with the direct sum\nM\nF p,p,r .\np \u2208 Z\u22650\nr \u2261 p mod 2\n\nWe now apply Frobenius reciprocity to analyze the isotypic components of\n\u03a91 (U(2))C . As we have noted as a representation of K it is just the smooth\ninduced representation of M to K where\nM = \u2206(U(2)) = {(u, u)|u \u2208 U(2)}\nis acting on Lie(U(2))C under Ad(u). Thus in terms of the parameters above\n(identifying M with U(2)) we have\nLie(U(2))C \u223c\n= F 0,0 \u2295 F 2,0 .\nNow Frobenius reciprocity implies that\ndim HomK (F p,q,r , \u03a91 (U(2))C ) = dim HomM (F p,q,r , F 0,0 )\n\n(1)\n\n+ dim HomM (F p,q,r , F 2,0 ).\n\n(2)\n\n12\n\n\fThe argument above says that dim HomM (F p,q,r , F 0,0) = 0 unless p = q and\nr \u2261 p mod 2. Now the Clebsch\u2013Gordan formula implies that\nmin(p,q)\np,q,r\nF|M\n\n\u223c\n=\n\nM\n\nF p+q\u22122j,r .\n\nj=0\n\nThis implies that dim HomM (F p,q,r , F 2,0 ) = 0 unless p = q or |p \u2212 q| = 2\nand in either of these cases it is 1.Now the exact sequences (1) and (2) above\nimply the theorem.\nRemark 5 In the physics literature if \u03c9 is a solution to Maxwell's equations\n(as in the beginning of Section 3), then a one-form \u03b2 such that d\u03b2 = \u03c9 yields\nin the E, H formulation a potential A. In our formulation if we pull back to\nMinkowski space and we write\n\u03b2=\n\n4\nX\n\nai dxi ,\n\ni=1\n\nthen considering t = x4 and writing \u03c6 = a4 and A = (a1 , a2 , a3 ) we then have\n\u2202A\n+ \u2207\u03c6.\n\u2202t\nThis is the dual of what one normally finds in the physics literature. It is\npointed out that this potential has the ambiguity of a gradient field. We\nwill see that the only isotypic components of Maxwell's equations are \u03c4p,q,r\nwith |p \u2212 q| = 2 and r = \u00b1(max(p, q)). Thus using only those Peter\u2013Weyl\ncoefficients yields a unique potential.\nE = \u2207 \u00d7 A, H = \u2212\n\nWe will use the above lemma and some direct calculations to describe the\nK-isotypic components of Maxwell's equations in the next section.\n\n5\n\nThe K-isotypic components of the space\nof solutions to Maxwell's equations on\ncompactified Minkowski space: step 2\n\nWe retain the notation of the previous section. Let x4 = iI and\n\u0015\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0014\n0 i\n0 1\ni 0\n.\n, x3 =\n, x2 =\nx1 =\ni 0\n\u22121 0\n0 \u2212i\n13\n\n\fWe will use the usual identification of Lie(U(2))(left invariant vector\nfields) with skew-Hermitian 2 \u00d7 2 matrices (which we denote, as is usual,\nby u(2)). Thus if x \u2208 u(2) then xu is the tangent vector at 0 to the curve\nt 7\u2212\u2192 uetx . We note that ((xj )u , (xk )u )u = \u03b5j \u03b4j,k with \u03b5j = \u2212(\u22121)\u03b4j4 . Thus\nx1 , x2 , x3 , x4 define a pseudo-orthonormal frame on U(2). We use this frame\nto define \u03b3. Since there will be many uses of the star operator and pullbacks\nwe will use the notation J\u03c9 = \u2217\u03c9 for \u03c9 \u2208 \u22272 T \u2217 (U(2))u for all u \u2208 U(2). We\ndefine \u03b1j to be the left invariant one-form on U(2) defined by \u03b1j (xk ) = \u03b4jk .\nWe note that\nJ\u03b11 \u2227 \u03b12 = \u03b13 \u2227 \u03b14 , J\u03b11 \u2227 \u03b13 = \u2212\u03b12 \u2227 \u03b14 , J\u03b12 \u2227 \u03b13 = \u03b11 \u2227 \u03b14\nand\nJ\u03b11 \u2227 \u03b14 = \u2212\u03b12 \u2227 \u03b13 , J\u03b12 \u2227 \u03b14 = \u03b11 \u2227 \u03b13 , J\u03b13 \u2227 \u03b14 = \u2212\u03b11 \u2227 \u03b12 .\nFrom this we note\nLemma 6 We have J 2 = \u2212I on each space \u22272 T \u2217 (U(2))u . Furthermore a\nbasis of the eigenspace for i in \u22272 T \u2217 (U(2))u \u2297 C is\nBi = {\u03b11 \u2227 \u03b14 + i\u03b12 \u2227 \u03b13 , \u03b12 \u2227 \u03b14 \u2212 i\u03b11 \u2227 \u03b13 , \u03b13 \u2227 \u03b14 + i\u03b11 \u2227 \u03b12 }\na basis for the eigenspace \u2212i is\nB\u2212i = {\u03b11 \u2227 \u03b14 \u2212 i\u03b12 \u2227 \u03b13 , \u03b12 \u2227 \u03b14 + i\u03b11 \u2227 \u03b13 , \u03b13 \u2227 \u03b14 \u2212 i\u03b11 \u2227 \u03b12 }.\nIf \u03bc \u2208 Bi and \u03bd \u2208 B\u2212i , then \u03bc \u2227 \u03bd = 0.\nWe look upon J as an operator on \u03a92 (U(2))C . Since J preserves the real\nvector space \u03a92 (U(2)) we get a decomposition\n\u03a92 (U(2))C = \u03a92 (U(2))i \u2295 \u03a92 (U(2))\u2212i\nwith J|\u03a92 (U (2))\u00b1i = \u00b1iI. If \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a92 (U(2))C then we denote by \u03c9 the complex\nconjugate of \u03c9 relative to the real space \u03a92 (U(2)). We note\nLemma 7 With the notation above, we have\nM\n\u03a92 (U(2))\u00b1i =\nC \u221e (U(2), C)\u03bc.\n\u03bc\u2208B\u00b1i\n\n14\n\n\fWe now calculate the exterior derivatives of the \u03b1j . We observe that if \u03b1\nis a left invariant element of \u03a91 (U(2)), then\nd\u03b1(x, y) = \u2212\u03b1([x, y])\nfor x, y \u2208 Lie(U(2)). This implies that\nd\u03b11 = \u22122\u03b12 \u2227 \u03b13 , d\u03b12 = 2\u03b11 \u2227 \u03b13 , d\u03b13 = \u22122\u03b11 \u2227 \u03b12 .\n\n(1)\n\nWe also note that d\u03b14 = 0.\nWe denote by \u03c7k the character of SU(2) \u00d7 S 1 given by \u03c7k (u, z) = z k . We\ndenote by \u03c0 the covering map \u03c0 : SU(2) \u00d7 S 1 \u2192 U(2) given by \u03c0(u, z) = uz.\nThen we have\nLemma 8 We have\n(ker d|\u03a92 (U (2))C )k,k,r = \u03c7r dC \u221e (U(2), C)k,k,0 \u2227 \u03b14\nwhich is defined on U(2) if r \u2261 k mod 2.\n\u221e\nProof.\nP We note that if f \u2208 C (U(2), C), then df = (x4 f )\u03b14\u2217+ \u03bd with\n\u03bd = j (xj f )\u03b1j . Thus if df \u2227 \u03b14 = 0 then \u03bd = 0. If \u03bd = 0 then \u03c0 f (u, z) =\n\u03c0 \u2217 f (I, z). A function in C \u221e (U(2), C)k,k,0 with this property exists if and only\nif k = 0. It is also clear that \u03c7r dC \u221e (U(2), C)k,k,0 \u2227 \u03b14 is contained in ker d.\nThus, since each of the isotypic components of ker d|\u03a92 (U (2))C is irreducible\nand we have accounted for all of them by Lemma 4, the result follows.\n\nWe denote by Maxw the space of complex solutions to the Maxwell equations (as described in the previous section). Then Maxw is a closed subspace\nof \u03a92 (U(2))C yielding a smooth Fr\u00e9chet representation of G of moderate\ngrowth under the action \u03bc(g)\u03c9 = (g \u22121 )\u2217 \u03c9. We also note that J preserves\nMaxw and commutes with the action of G. This implies that Maxw = Maxwi\n\u2295 Maxw\u2212i (corresponding to the i and \u2212i eigenspaces of J on Maxw). We\nalso note\nLemma 9 Maxw\u00b1i = {\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a92 (U(2))C |J\u03c9 = \u00b1i\u03c9 and d\u03c9 = 0}.\nWe can now eliminate some isotypic components of Maxw.\nLemma 10 Maxwk,k,r = 0 for all k \u2208 Z\u22650 and all r \u2208 Z.\n15\n\n\fProof. If \u03c9 \u2208 Maxwk,k,r , then since\nMaxwk,k,r = Maxwk,k,r \u2229 Maxwi \u2295 Maxwk,k,r \u2229 Maxw\u2212i\nwith each of the summands K-invariant and since each isotypic component\nis irreducible we see that J\u03c9 = i\u03c9 of J\u03c9 = \u2212i\u03c9. In either case Lemma 6\nimplies that \u03c9 is not an element of \u03a91 (U(2))C \u2227 \u03b14 . But Lemma 7 implies\nthat it must be of that form. This implies that \u03c9 = 0.\nWe are finally ready to give the isotypic components of Maxw.\nTheorem 11 Maxwp,q,r is nonzero if and only if (p, q, r) is in one the following forms\n(k + 2, k, k + 2), (k + 2, k, \u2212(k + 2)), (k, k + 2, k + 2), (k, k + 2, \u2212(k + 2)).\nIf it is nonzero it is irreducible. Moreover, Maxwk+2,k,k+2 and Maxwk,k+2,\u2212k\u22122\nare contained in Maxwi and Maxwk+2,k,\u2212k\u22122 and Maxwk,k+2,k+2 are contained\nin Maxw\u2212i .\nThe proof will occupy the rest of the section. If x \u2208 sl(2, C) with x =\nv + iw, v, w \u2208 su(2), then we define the left invariant vector field xL f (u) =\nd\n(f (uetv ) + if (uetw ))|t=0 and xR f (u) = dtd (f (e\u2212tv u) + if (e\u2212tw v))|t=0 . We will\ndt\nthink of these vector fields as being on SU(2) or SU(2)/{\u00b1I} = U(2)/S 1 I =\nP SU(2). We set e = 21 (x2 \u2212 ix3 ), f = \u2212 21 (x2 + ix3 ) and h = \u2212ix1 . Then\ne, f, h form the standard basis of sl(2, C).\nLet \u03beeL , \u03befL , \u03behL (respectively, \u03beeR , \u03befR , \u03behR ) be the left (resp. right) invariant one-forms on P SU(2) that form a dual basis to eL , f L , hL (respectively,\neR , f R , hR ). Let p : U(2) \u2192 P SU(2) be the obvious quotient homomorphism\nand let \u03b1ba = p\u2217 \u03beba for a = L or R and b = e, f or h. Now ((u, v)\u22121)\u2217 \u03b1bL (xL ) =\n\u03b1bL (Ad(v)\u22121 xL ) and ((u, v)\u22121)\u2217 \u03b1bR (xR ) = \u03b1bR (Ad(u)\u22121 xR ). Thus, if\n\u0015\u0013\n\u0015 \u0014\n\u0012\u0014\nw 0\nz 0\n,\ng=\n0 w \u22121\n0 z \u22121\nwith z, w \u2208 S 1 , then\n(g \u22121)\u2217 \u03b1eL = w \u22122\u03b1eL , (g \u22121)\u2217 \u03b1fL = w 2 \u03b1fL , (g \u22121 )\u2217 \u03b1hL = \u03b1hL\nand\n(g \u22121 )\u2217 \u03b1eR = u\u22122 \u03b1eR , (g \u22121)\u2217 \u03b1fR = u2 \u03b1fR , (g \u22121)\u2217 \u03b1hR = \u03b1hR .\n16\n\n\fThis implies that\nSpanC (\u03b1eL , \u03b1fL , \u03b1hL ) = \u03a91 (U(2))0,2,0\nand\nSpanC (\u03b1eR , \u03b1fR , \u03b1hR ) = \u03a91 (U(2))2,0,0 .\nAlso relative to the positive root system g \u2192 u2 , g \u2192 w 2 the highest weight\nspace of \u03a91 (U(2))0,2,0 in C\u03b1fL and that of \u03a91 (U(2))2,0,0 is C\u03b1fR .\nWe can now describe highest weight vectors for the isotypic components\n1\n\u03a9 (U(2))k,k+2,l and \u03a91 (U(2))k+2,k,l. Let e1 and e2 be the standard basis of C2 .\nFix a U(2) invariant inner product h. . . , . . .i on each space S k (C2 ). Define\n\u03c6k (u) = S k (u)ek1 , ek2 .\nThen \u03c6k is a highest weight vector for C \u221e (U(2))k,k,k = \u03a90 (U(2))k,k,k . Also we\ndefine \u03c7l (u, z) = z l for u \u2208 SU(2) and z \u2208 S 1 . We note that if l \u2261 k mod 2,\nthen\n\u03c8k,l (uz) = z l\u2212k \u03c6k (uz) = \u03c7l\u2212k (u, z)\u03c6k (uz)\nis defined and is a highest weight vector for \u03a90 (U(2))k,k,l. This implies that\n\u03c8k,l \u03b1fL is a highest weight vector for \u03a91 (U(2))k,k+2,l and \u03c8k,l \u03b1fR is a highest\nweight vector for \u03a91 (U(2))k+2,k,l . We have shown that Maxw is multiplicity\nfree and Maxw = Maxwi \u2295 Maxw\u2212i . We have also proved that Maxwk,k+2,l =\nd\u03a91 (U(2))k,k+2,l and Maxwk+2,k,l = d\u03a91 (U(2))k+2,k,l . We have proved that\n(1) Maxwk,k+2,l 6= 0 if and only if Jd\u03c8k,l \u03b1fL = \u03bbJ\u03c8k,l \u03b1fL with \u03bb \u2208 {\u00b1i} and\nMaxwk+2,k,l 6= 0 if and only if Jd\u03c8k,l \u03b1fR = \u03bbJ\u03c8k,l \u03b1fR with \u03bb \u2208 {\u00b1i}.\n\nWe are now left with a computation. One checks as above (using d\u03b1fL (X L , Y L ) =\n\u2212\u03b1fL ([X, Y ]L ))\nd\u03b1fL = 2\u03b1hL \u2227 \u03b1fL ;\nwe therefore have\nd(\u03c8k,l \u03b1fL ) = il\u03c8k,l \u03b14 \u2227 \u03b1fL + (k + 2)\u03c8k,l \u03b1hL \u2227 \u03b1fL .\nWe consider il\u03b14 \u2227 \u03b1fL + (k + 2)\u03b1hL \u2227 \u03b1fL . We observe that \u03b1hL = i\u03b11 and\n\u03b1fL = \u2212(\u03b12 \u2212 i\u03b13 ). Thus (using the calculations leading to Lemma 6) the\nright-hand side of the equation above is equal to\nli\u03b14 \u2227 \u03b12 \u2212 l\u03b14 \u2227 \u03b13 + i(k + 2)\u03b11 \u2227 (\u03b12 \u2212 i\u03b13 )\n17\n\n\fwhich equals\n(\u2212li\u03b12 \u2227 \u03b14 + (k + 2)J\u03b12 \u2227 \u03b14 ) + (\u2212l\u03b11 \u2227 \u03b14 \u2212 i(k + 2)J\u03b11 \u2227 \u03b14 .\nWe therefore see that if l > 0 then this expression is an element of \u03a92 (U(2))\u2212i +\n(l \u2212 k \u2212 2)(\u2212i\u03b12 \u2227 \u03b14 \u2212 (l \u2212 k \u2212 2)\u03b11 \u2227 \u03b14 ). If l \u2264 0 then it is an element of\n\u03a92 (U(2))i + (l + k + 2)(\u2212i\u03b12 \u2227 \u03b14 \u2212 (l + k + 2)\u03b11 \u2227 \u03b14 ). Thus we have\n(2) Maxwk,k+2,l 6= 0 only if l = k + 2 or l = \u2212(k + 2). Furthermore,\nMaxwk,k+2,k+2 \u2282 Maxw\u2212i and Maxwk,k+2,\u2212(k+2) \u2282 Maxwi .\n\nWe note that everything that we have done could have been done with\nright-invariant vector fields to complete the proof of the theorem. However\nwe will proceed in a different way. Let \u03b7 : U(2) \u2192 U(2) be defined by\n\u03b7(u) = u\u22121 . Then for x \u2208 u(2), we have d\u03b7u (xLu ) = xR\nu\u22121 . This implies that\nd\u03b7u (xLu ), d\u03b7u (xLu )\n\nu\u22121\n\nR\n= xR\nu\u22121 , xu\u22121\n\nu\u22121\n\n= \u2212 det x\n\nsince\nR\nxR\nu\u22121 , xu\u22121\n\nu\u22121\n\n\u22121\nR\n= dR(u\u22121 )I (xR\nI ), dR(u )I (xI )\n\nu\u22121\n\nR\n= xR\nI , xI\n\nI\n\n.\n\nThis proves that \u03b7 is an isometry. It also implies that\n(\u03b7 \u2217 \u03b1fR )u (xLu ) = (\u03b1fR )u\u22121 (d\u03b7u (xLu )) = (\u03b1fR )u\u22121 (xR\nu\u22121 ).\nHence \u03b7 \u2217 \u03b1fR = \u03b1fL . Now \u03b7 \u2217 d(\u03c8k,l \u03b1fR ) \u2208 \u03a92 (U(2))k,k+2,\u2212l since \u03b7 \u2217 \u03c6k is a highest weight vector for C \u221e (U(2))k,k,\u2212k . We also note that \u03b7 \u2217 \u03b3 = \u03b3. Thus\n\u03b7 \u2217 Maxw = Maxw. Hence, if d(\u03c8k,l \u03b1fR ) \u2208 Maxwk+2,k,l , then \u03b7 \u2217 d(\u03c8k,l \u03b1fR ) \u2208\nMaxwk,k+2,\u2212l . So, if l > 0 then, we must have l = k + 2 and if l \u2264 0, then\nl = \u2212k \u2212 2. Since \u03b7 \u2217 commutes with J the last assertion also follows.\nRemark 12 We have\n\u03b7 \u2217 Maxwk+2,k,k+2 = Maxwk,k+2,\u2212k\u22122,\n\n(3)\n\n\u03b7 \u2217 Maxwk+2,k,\u2212k\u22122 = Maxwk,k+2,k+2 and (\u03b7 \u2217 )2 = I.\n\n(4)\n\n18\n\n\f6\n\nThe Hermitian form\n\nWe retain the notation of the previous sections.\nWe note that\nH3 (U(2), R) = R.\nThe form \u03bd = \u03b11 \u2227 \u03b12 \u2227 \u03b13 restricted to SU(2) satisfies\nZ\n\u03bd = 2\u03c0 2\nSU (2)\n\nand d\u03bd = 0. This implies that the class of SU(2) in the third homology over\nR is a basis. (In fact it is well known that this is true over Z). We note\nthat this implies, in particular, that if \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a93 (U(3))C satisfies d\u03c9 = 0 then\nif M is a compact submanifold such that there exists a smooth family of\ndiffeomorphisms of U(2), \u03a6t such that \u03a60 = I and \u03a61 (SU(2)) = M, then\nZ\nZ\n\u03c9=\n\u03c9.\nSU (2)\n\nM\n\nIn particular we have (since U(2,2) is connected),\nif \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a93 (U(3))C satisfies d\u03c9 = 0, then\nRLemma 13\nR If g \u2208 U(2,\nR 2) and\n\u03c9 = gSU (2) \u03c9 = SU (2) g \u2217 \u03c9.\nSU (2)\n\nWe will apply this observation to define U(2, 2) invariant sesquilinear\nforms on the spaces Maxw\u00b1i .\n\nLemma 14 Let \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a91 (U(2))C and \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a92 (U(2))C be such that \u03c9, d\u03b1 \u2208\nMaxwi (resp.

Hence d(\u03b1 \u2227 \u03c9) = d\u03b1 \u2227 \u03c9 and Lemma 6 implies that\nMaxwi \u2227 Maxw\u2212i = 0. Obviously the same argument works for \u2212i.\nProposition 15 If \u03bc, \u03c9 \u2208 Maxwi (or Maxw\u2212i ), there exists \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a91 (U(2))C\nsuch that d\u03b1 = \u03c9. The expression\nZ\n\u03b1\u2227\u03bc\nSU (2)\n\ndepends only on \u03c9 and \u03bc (and not on the choice of \u03b1).

Suppose that \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a91 (U(2))C is such that d\u03b2 = 0 and S 1 I \u03b2 = 0.\nThen since H1 (U(2), C) is spanned by the class of S 1 I, de Rham's theorem\n\u221e\nRimplies that there exists f \u2208 C (U(2), C) such that df = \u03b2.

We note Theorem\n11 implies that each of these spaces is totally contained in Maxwi or Maxw\u2212i .\nThis implies that the Hermitian form, h. . . , . . .i from the previous section is\ndefined on each of these spaces.\nWe have\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\nTheorem 19 Each of the spaces Maxw+\n2,0 , Maxw2,0 , Maxw 0,2 , Maxw0,2 is\nan invariant irreducible subspace for \u03c0. Furthermore, the form h. . . , . . .i\n\u2212\n+\nis positive definite on Maxw+\n2,0 , Maxw2,0 and negative definite on Maxw0.2 ,\n\u2212\nMaxw0,2 .\n\nProof. We consider Maxw+\n2,0 . We note that using the Clebsch\u2013Gordan\nformula as above we have\np\u2212 Maxwk+2,k,k+2 \u2282 Maxwk+3,k+1,k+3 + Maxwk+3,k\u22121,k+3\n+Maxwk+1,k+2,k+3 + Maxwk+1,k\u22121,k+3\nand\np+ Maxwk+2,k,k+2 \u2282 Maxwk+3,k+1,k+1 + Maxwk+3,k\u22121,k+1\n+Maxwk+1,k+1,k+1 + Maxwk+1,k\u22121,k+1.\nUsing the form of the K-types of Maxw we see that\np\u2212 Maxwk+2,k,k+2 \u2282 Maxwk+3,k+1,k+3\nand\np+ Maxwk+2,k,k+2 \u2282 Maxwk+1,k\u22121,k+1.\n\n+\nThis implies that (Maxw+\n2,0 )K is a (g,K)-submodule of Maxw. Hence Maxw2,0\nis G-invariant. The same argument proves\n\np\u2212 Maxwk,k+2,k+2 \u2282 Maxwk+1,k+3,k+3,\np+ Maxwk,k+2,k+2 \u2282 Maxwk\u22121,k+1,k+1,\n\np+ Maxwk+2,k,\u2212(k+2) \u2282 Maxwk+3,k+1,\u2212(k+3)\n\np\u2212 Maxwk+2,k,\u2212(k+2) \u2282 Maxwk+1,k\u22121,\u2212(k+1)\n23\n\n\fand\np+ Maxwk,k+2,\u2212(k+2) \u2282 Maxwk+1,k+2,\u2212(k+3)\n\np\u2212 Maxwk,k+2,\u2212(k+2) \u2282 Maxwk\u22121,k+1,\u2212(k+1).\nThis proves the G-invariance of the indicated spaces. We next note that\nsince the multiplicities of the K-types of Maxw are all one, the Hermitian\nform h. . . , . . .i restricted to each space Maxwk,l,m is 0, positive definite or\nnegative definite. Thus Lemma 16 implies that the form is negative definite\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n\u2217\non (Maxw+\n0,2 )K and (Maxw0,2 )K . Recall that \u03b7 (Maxw 0,2 )K = (Maxw2,0 )K\n+\nand \u03b7 \u2217 Maxw\u2212\n0,2 )K = (Maxw 2,0 )K . Furthermore \u03b7 is orientation reversing on\n\u2212\nSU(2), thus the form on (Maxw+\n2,0 )K and (Maxw2,0 )K is positive definite. If\none of the representations were not irreducible, then it would have a finitedimensional invariant subspace (by the above formulae). Since these representations are all unitarizable and do not contain one-dimensional invariant\nsubspaces the representations are all irreducible.\nRemark 20 The proof above implies that the last six inclusions above are\nall equalities.\n\u03b5\nWe set \u03c0i,j\nequal to the action of G on Maxw\u03b5i,j for \u03b5 = +, \u2212 and i, j = 0, 2\nor 2, 0.\n\u03b5\nfor \u03b5 = +, \u2212 and i, j = 0, 2 or 2, 0\nTheorem 21 The representations \u03c0i,j\nall have trivial infinitesimal character (that is equal to the restriction to the\ncenter of U(g) of the augmentation homomorphism to its center). Furthermore\nH 2 (g,K, Maxw\u03b5i,j ) = C, \u03b5 = +, \u2212 and i, j = 0, 2 or 2, 0.\n\nProof. By the above, all four of the representations are the spaces of C \u221e\nvectors of an irreducible unitary representation. Since the center of g acts\ntrivially and\ndim HomK (\u22272 p,M) = 1\nfor each M as in the statement, it is enough to prove that the Casimir\noperator corresponding to the trace form on g acts by 0 on each of the\nrepresentations (c.f. [BW]). We will show that the center of the enveloping\nalgebra acts correctly. We look at the case Maxw+\n2,0 and leave the other\n+\ncases to the reader. By Lemma 18 (Maxw2,0 )K is a highest weight module\nrelative to the Weyl chamber (in \u03b5 notation) \u03b51 > \u03b52 > \u03b53 > \u03b54 . We calculate\n24\n\n\fthe highest weight \u03bb = a\u03b51 + b\u03b52 + c\u03b53 + d\u03b54 . The representation factors\nthrough the adjoint group so a + b + c + d = 0. By definition of F 2,0,2\na\u2212b = 2, c\u2212d = 0, c+d = 2. Solving the four equations yields \u22122\u03b52 +\u03b53 +\u03b54 .\n\u03c1 for the chamber that we are studying is 32 \u03b51 + 21 \u03b52 \u2212 21 \u03b53 \u2212 32 \u03b54 . Thus\n\u03bb + \u03c1 = 32 \u03b51 \u2212 23 \u03b52 + 12 \u03b53 \u2212 12 \u03b54 = \u03c3\u03c1 for \u03c3 the cyclic permutation (243).\nLet \u03b8 be the Cartan involution of G1 corresponding to K. In light of\nthe Vogan\u2013Zuckerman theorem [VZ] this implies that there are four \u03b8 stable parabolic subalgebras q\u03b5i,j \u03b5 = +, \u2212 and i, j = 0, 2 or 2, 0, such that\n(Maxw\u03b5i,j )K is isomorphic with Aq\u03b5i,j (0) (c.f. [BW]).\nTheorem 22 q+\n2,0 is the parabolic subalgebra\n{[xij ] \u2208 M4 (C)|x21 = x31 = x41 = 0},\nq+\n0,2 = {[xij ] \u2208 M4 (C)|x41 = x42 = x43 = 0},\n\n+ T\n\u2212\n+ T\nand q\u2212\n0,2 = (q0,2 ) , q2,0 = (q2,0 ) .\n\nProof. If q is a \u03b8-stable parabolic subalgebra with nilpotent radical u and\nif un = u \u2229 p, we set 2\u03c1n (q)(h) = trad(h)| un for h \u2208 h the Cartan subalgebra\nof diagonal matrices. One checks that if the parabolics are given as in the\n2,0,2\ntheorem, then 2\u03c1n (q+\n, 2\u03c1n (q+\n2,0 ) is the highest weight of F\n0,2 ) is that of\n\u2212\n0,2,2\n2,0,\u22122\nF\n, 2\u03c1n (q2,0 ) is the lowest weight of F\n, and 2\u03c1n (q\u2212\n)\n0,2 is the lowest\n0,2,\u22122\nweight of F\n. Now the result follows from the main theorem (c.f. [W1]).\nRemark 23 This result implies that if we consider the open orbit X of\nU(2, 2) in P3 (C) that has no non-constant holomorphic functions, then there\nare two holomorphic line bundles and two anti-holomorphic line bundles such\nthat their degree 1 smooth sheaf cohomology yields the four versions of solutions of Maxwell's equations. The relation between the two realizations is\nthe Penrose\u2013Twistor transform.\nAnother realization of these representations is in [GW]. The observation\nhere is that SU(2, 2) is the quaternionic real form of SL(4, C). Since K \u2229\nSU(2, 2) = S(U(2)\u00d7U(2)) there are two invariant quaternionic structures on\nSU(2, 2)/K \u2229SU(2, 2) and on each of two line bundles on which the methods\nof [GW] apply. Each yields an element of the \"analytic continuation\" of the\n25\n\n\fcorresponding quaternionic discrete series which is our third realization. We\nwill allow the interested reader to check these assertions.\nFinally, these representations appear in Howe duality between U(2, 2) and\nthe U(1) in its center. The details are worked out in [BW], VIII, 2.10\u20132.12\nin the notation therein, and the pertinent representations are V2 and V\u22122\n+\nyielding Maxw+\n2,0 )K and Maxw0,2 )K . The other two constituents are gotten\nby duality.\n\n8\n\nA dual pair in P SU (2, 2)\n\nWe continue to consider U(2, 2) as the group G1 in Section 2 and P SU(2, 2)\nthe quotient by the center. Let S be the image of the subgroup of all matrices\nof the form\n\u0014\n\u0015\naI bI\nbI aI\nwith |a|2 \u2212 |b|2 = 1. Then S is isomorphic with P SU(1, 1). The image of the\nsubgroup of P SU(2, 2) that centralizes every element of S is the image of\nthe group of all block 2 \u00d7 2 diagonal elements of G1 , C which is isomorphic\nwith SO(3). These two groups form a reductive dual pair (the commutant\nof C is S). Before we analyze this pair, we will indicate its relationship with\ntime in Minkowski space. If we write coordinates in Section 2 as x1 , x2 .x3\nand x4 = t, then we have according to our rules\n(0, 0, 0, t) 7\u2212\u2192\n\n(1 + it)\nI.\n1 \u2212 it\n\nIn terms of the linear fractional action of U(2, 2) on U(2) this corresponds to\n\"\n#\n\u221a1+it I\n0\n2\n1+t\n.I.\n\u221a1\u2212it I\n0\n1+t2\nThat is, the time axis is the orbit of K \u2229 S with \u2212I deleted.\nAs we observed, the center of U(2, 2) acts trivially on Maxw and thus we\ncan consider the action of the group C \u00d7 S through CS on Maxw. Let Hk\ndenote the representation of SO(3) on the spherical harmonics of degree k.\nWe denote by D2k ,k \u2208 Z \u2212 {0}, the discrete series of S (D2k has K-types\n2k + 2sgn(k)Z\u22650 ).\n26\n\n\f+\nTheorem 24 As a representation of C \u00d7 S, (Maxw+\n2,0 )K and (Maxw0,2 )K\nare equivalent with\nM\nHk \u2297 D\u2212(2k+2)\nk\u22651\n\nand\n\n(Maxw\u2212\n2,0 )K\n\nand\n\n(Maxw\u2212\n0,2 )K\n\nM\nk\u22651\n\nare equivalent with\nHk \u2297 D2k+2 .\n\nProof. By considering the K-types we see that each of the modules has finite\nK \u2229CS-multiplicities. We will give details for M = (Maxw+\n2,0 )K . Noting that\nS \u2229 K is\n\u0015\n\u001b\n\u001a\u0014\naI\n| |a| = 1\na\u22121 I\nwe see that the characters that appear for S \u2229 K on M are a\u22124 , a\u22126 , ... each\nwith finite multiplicity. Thus, as a representation of S, M is a direct sum of\nhighest weight modules. It is therefore enough to check that the character\nof M as a CS \u2229 K module is correct. We note that in the formulation of the\nK-types, we can look upon CS \u2229 K as the image of the group of all matrices\n\u0015\n\u0014\nu(y)\n0\n0 u(y)x\u22122\n\u0015\n\u0014\ny 0\nand |x| and |y| = 1. Set t(x, y) equal to this element.\nwith u(y) =\n0 y \u22121\nThen if Ch(V ) denotes the character of a CS \u2229 K module and \u03c7k denotes\nthe character of SU(2) on S k (C2 ), we have as a formal sum\nCh(M) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03c7k+2 (u(y))\u03c7k (u(y))x\u22122k\u22124\n\nk=0\n\nreplacing x with x\u22121 and plugging in \u03c7k (u(y)) = y k (1 + y \u22122 + . . . + y \u22122k ) and\nsumming we have\nx4 (y 4 \u2212 x2 y 2 + y 2 + 1)\n.\n(1 \u2212 x2 )(y 2 \u2212 x2 )(1 \u2212 x2 y 2)\n\nIf we multiply by 1 \u2212 x2 and expand in powers of x, we see that the series is\nx4\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03c72k+2 (u(y))x2k .\n\nk=0\n\n27\n\n\fThis implies the result in this case since the character of D\u22122k is\n\u0012\n\u0013\nx\u22122k\nx2k\nresp.\n1 \u2212 x\u22122\n1 + x2\nif k > 0 (resp.k < 0). The other highest weight case is exactly the same. The\n\u2212\ncases (Maxw\u2212\n2,0 )K and (Maxw0,2 )K are handled in the same way but with the\npowers of x inverted.\n\n9\n\nPlane wave solutions and (degenerate)\nWhittaker vectors\n\nRecall that a plane wave solution to Maxwell's are those in the following\nform\nE = ei(z,x) Eo\nand\nH = ei(z,x) Ho\nwith Eo and Ho constant vectors, z = (u1 , u2, u3 , \u03c9)P\u2208 R4 , u = (u1 , u2 , u3 ),\nx = (x1 , x2 , x3 , t) \u2208 R4 , and as before, (z, x) = \u2212 ui xi + \u03c9t. To satisfy\nMaxwell's equations we must have u * Eo = 0, u * Ho = 0 and\n\u2207\u00d7E =\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\nH,\u2207 \u00d7 H = \u2212 E.\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n\nThe first implies that u \u00d7 Eo = \u2212\u03c9Ho and the second u \u00d7 Ho = \u03c9Eo .\nu\nHo\nThus, if the solution is non-constant and \u03c9 > 0 (resp. \u03c9 < 0) kuk\n, kH\n, Eo\no k kEo k\nHo\nu\n, kH\n, \u2212Eo ) is an orthonormal basis of R3 obeying the \"right-hand\n(resp. kuk\no k kEo k\n\nscrew law\". Putting these equations together yields \u03c9 2 = kuk2 , that is, z\nis isotropic in R1,3 . That is on the null light cone. This fits with the fact\nthat if E, H form a solution to Maxwell's equations, then their individual\ncomponents satisfy the wave equation.\nThe purpose of this section is to interpret the plane wave solutions in\nthe context of the four representations we have been studying. In the last\nfew sections we have been emphasizing the realization of U(2, 2) which we\nhave denoted by G1 . We now revert to the form G since the embedding of\n\n28\n\n\fMinkowski space into U(2) is clearer for that realization. Recall that the\nembedding is implemented in two stages; we map (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ) to\n\u0015\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0014\nx4 + x3 x1 + ix2\nI 0\n.\n,Y =\nx1 \u2212 ix2 x4 \u2212 x3\nY I\nWe denote the image group by N (note Y \u2217 = Y ). Then we consider the image\nof I under the action of G on U(2) by linear fractional transformations.\nIn this context to simplify the form subgroup S we must apply a Cayley\ntransform. If we set\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\nI iI\n,\nL= \u221a\n2 I \u2212iI\nthen the transform is given by\n\n\u03c3 \u22121 (g) = L\u22121 gL.\nThus, in this incarnation, we take S to be the set of elements of P SU(2, 2)\nas G/Center(G) in the form\n\u0015\n\u0014\naI bI\ncI dI\nwith Im ab = 0, ab \u2212 bc = 1, Im cd = 0. This implies that the image of S \u2229 N\nis the set of matrices\n\u0014\n\u0015\nI 0\ncI I\n\nwith c \u2208 R. Let z = (k1 , k2 , k3 , \u03c9) be, as above, an element in the light cone.\nThen considering\nz, as\n\u0014\n\u0015 giving a linear functional on Lie(N), this functional\n0 0\nrestricted to\n\u2208 Lie(S \u2229 N) is given by the coefficient of q in the\nxI 0\nquadratic polynomial\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n\u03c9 + k3 + qx\nk1 + ik2\ndet\nk1 \u2212 ik2\n\u03c9 \u2212 k3 + qx\n2\nwhich is \u03c9x. We will record this as a lemma since we will need to apply it\nlater in this section.\n\n29\n\n\fLemma 25 If z = (k1 , k2 , k3 , \u03c9) is in the null light cone and if we consider\nz as a linear functional on Lie(N) (as above), then its value on\n\u0015\n\u0014\n0 0\nxI 0\nis \u03c9x.\nWe now relate these plane wave solutions to the representations Maxw\u00b1\n\u03b1,b\n\u00b1\nwith (\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2208 {(2, 0), {0, 2)}. Let H\u03b1,\u03b2\nbe the corresponding Hilbert space\ncompletions of these smooth Fr\u00e9chet representations of moderate growth.\n\u221e\nThen the Maxw\u00b1\nvectors. Fix one of these represen\u03b1,b are the spaces of C\ntations and denote it by (\u03c0, H). Let HK be the space of K-finite vectors and\nlet hv, wik = (I + CK )kd v, w for v, w \u2208 HK , h. . . , . . .i the unitary structure\nand d = dim K. Let H k be the Hilbert space completion of HK with respect\nto h. . . , . . .ik . Then H 0 = H and the maps Tk,l : H l \u2192 H k for k > l \u2265 0\nthat are the identity on HK are nuclear (see [GV] for the definition). Thus\nwe have \u2229k\u22650 H k = H \u221e . We set H \u2212k equal to the dual Hilbert space to H k .\nThus (H \u221e )\u2032 = \u222ak\u22650 H \u2212k . We thus have a rigged Hilbert space in the sense\nof [GV], Chapter 1. We now consider (\u03c0, H) as a unitary representation of\nN. We have (c.f. [W1], Theorem 14.10.3) a direct integral decomposition of\n(\u03c0, H) as a representation of N given as follows:\nZ\nC\u03c7 \u2297 W\u03c7 d\u03c4 (\u03c7)\nb\nsupp(\u03c0)\u2282N\n\nwith supp(\u03c0) defined as in [W1, Volume 2, p. 337], \u03c4 a Borel measure on\nsupp(\u03c0), and \u03c7 \u2192 W\u03c7 a Borel measurable Hilbert vector bundle over supp(\u03c0).\nIn this case supp(p) is just the support of \u03c4 as a distribution. The theorem\nof Gelfand\u2013Kostyuchenko (c.f. [GV], p. 117 Theorem 1\u2032 and the remarks at\nthe end of Subsection 1.4.4) implies that there exists, k > 0 and a family of\nnuclear operators T\u03c7 : H k \u2192 W\u03c7 such that if u \u2208 H k , then u(\u03c7) = T\u03c7 (u) for\n\u03c4 -almost all \u03c7. This implies that for all \u03c7 and all u \u2208 H k ,\nT\u03c7 (\u03c0(n)u) = \u03c7(n)T\u03c7 (u).\nIf T\u03c7 is always 0 then H = 0. We see that there is a subset A of supp(\u03c0)\nof full measure with T\u03c7 6= 0 for \u03c7 \u2208 A. By definition of the H k we see that\nif \u03c7 \u2208 A, then there exists \u03bb \u2208 W\u03c7\u2032 such that \u03bb \u25e6 T\u03c7 6= 0. We have for this\nchoice\n\u03bb \u25e6 T\u03c7 (\u03c0(n)u) = \u03c7(n)\u03bb \u25e6 T\u03c7 (u)\n30\n\n\fb then set\nfor all n \u2208 N and all u \u2208 H \u221e .

Both \u03c02,0\n, \u03c00,2\nhave support equal to the set of all \u03c7Z with det Z = 0\n\u2212\n\u2212\nand trZ \u2264 0 (negative light cone) and both \u03c02,0\n, \u03c02,0\nhave support equal to the\nset of all \u03c7Z with det Z = 0 and trZ \u2265 0 (positive light cone).\nNote: The proof of this result will use earlier work of the authors\n[K],[W2],[W3].\n+\nProof. We will do all the details for Maxw+\n2,0 . The case Maxw0,2 is essentially\n\u2212\n\u2212\nthe same. The cases Maxw2,0 and Maxw0,2 are done with an interchange of\np\u00b1 with p\u2213 . Set q = k \u2295 p+ where k = Lie(K)C . We consider F 2,0,2 to be\nthe q-module with k acting through the differential of the K action and p+\nacting by 0. Set\nN(F 2,0,2 ) = U(g) \u2297U (q) F 2,0,2 .\n\nThen Lemma 18 implies that we have a surjective (g, K)-module homomorphism\np : N(F 2,0,2 ) \u2192 Maxw+\n2,0 )K .\n+\nThus p\u2217 W h\u03c7 (\u03c02,0\n) is contained in\n\nW\u03c7 = {\u03bb \u2208 HomC (N(F 2,0,2 ), C)|\u03bb(Y v) = d\u03c7(Y )\u03bb(v), Y \u2208 Lie(N )}.\n\n+\n+\nSince p\u2217 : W h\u03c7 (\u03c02,0\n) \u2192 W\u03c7 is injective ((Maxw+\n2,0 )K is dense in Maxw2,0 )\nthe dimension estimate will follow if we prove that dim W\u03c7 = 3. For this we\nuse the observation in [W3] that if\n\u0015\n\u001b\n\u001a\u0014\ng\n0\n|g \u2208 GL(2, C) ,\nL=\n0 (g \u22121 )\u2217\n\n31\n\n\fthen Lie(LN )C and q are opposite parabolic subalgebras (i.e., Lie(LN)C \u2229 q\nis a Levi factor of both parabolic subalgebras). This implies that N(F 2,0,2 )\nis a free Lie(N )C module on dim F 2,0,2 = 3 generators. This clearly implies\nthat dim W\u03c7 = 3.\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\nI 0\nI\n0\ng\n0\n\u22121\nthen m\nm =\n.\nWe now note if m =\n\u22121 \u2217\nY I\ng*Y I\n\u0014\n\u0015 0 (g )\nI 0\n+\nSet n = n(Y ) =\n. If \u03bb \u2208 W h\u03c7Z (\u03c02,0\n), then\nY I\n+\n+\n+\n+\n\u03bb \u25e6 \u03c02,0\n(m)(\u03c02,0\n(n)u) = \u03bb(\u03c02,0\n(m)\u03c02,0\n(n)u)\n+\n+\n+\n= \u03bb(\u03c02,0\n(mnm\u22121 )\u03c02,0\n(m)u) = \u03c7Z (mnm\u22121 )\u03bb \u25e6 \u03c02,0\n(m)(u)\n+\n(m)(u).\n= \u03c7g\u22121 *Z (n)\u03bb \u25e6 \u03c02,0\n\n+\n+\n+\nThus \u03bb \u25e6 \u03c02,0\n(m) \u2208 W h\u03c7g\u22121 Z (\u03c02,0\n). This implies that supp(\u03c02,0\n) is a union of\norbits.\n+\nWe now observe using results in [W3] that we can show that if W h\u03c7Z (\u03c02,0\n) 6=\n+\n0 with det Z 6= 0, then the GK-dimension of (Maxw2,0 )K is at least dim N =4.\nIndeed, this condition implies that the dual module to Maxw+\n2,0 )K contains\nan irreducible submodule of GK-dimension 4. However as a p\u2212 -module\n(Maxw+\n2,0 )K is graded with the k-th level of the grad being isomorphic with\nthe K-module F k+2,k,k+2 whose dimension is (k + 3)(k + 1). Thus the GKdimension of (Maxw+\n2,0 )K is 3. Thus we must have det Z = 0. To complete\nthe proof, it is enough to prove 3. Since there are three orbits of L in set of\nall Z with det Z = 0:\n\nO+ = {Z| det Z = 0, trZ > 0}, O+ = {Z| det Z = 0, trZ < 0}, {0}.\n+\nThus we must prove that if W h\u03c7Z (\u03c02,0\n) 6= 0 and Z 6= 0 then trZ < 0. This\nfollows from Theorem 17 (p. 306) in [W2] (in this reference the roles of \u03c7\nand \u03c7\u22121 are reversed). We can also prove the result directly using Lemma\n+\n25. Let \u03bb 6= 0 be an element of W h\u03c7Z (\u03c02,0\n) with Z 6= 0. Then set \u03b7 = d\u03c7Z .\nIf\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03c9 + k3 k1 + ik2\n,\nZ=\nk1 \u2212 ik2 \u03c9 \u2212 k3 x\n\nthen trZ = 2\u03c9. In Lemma 25 we saw that\n\u0015\n\u0014\n0 0\n= \u03c9x.\n\u03b7\nxI 0\n32\n\n\fThis if S is as in the previous section and \u03bd = \u03c7|N \u2229S then in the notation\nof [W2] Theorem 2, r\u03bd = \u03c9. Thus that theorem (also see [K]) implies that\n(taking into account the reversal of signs mentioned above) r\u03bd < 0. This\ncompletes the proof.\nRemark 27 The above results imply that in the steady state solutions\nto Maxwell's equations the plane wave solutions should be looked upon as\n2-currents. That is, using \u03b3, they are distributions on Maxw.\n\n10\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper we have shown (Theorem 19) that the solutions to Maxwell's\nequations that extend to the conformal compactification of Minkowski space\nbreak up into four irreducible unitary representations: 2 positive energy and\n2 negative energy (in the sense of lowest weight or highest weight respectively) as a representation of the conformal group of the wave equation. The\nsupport of each of the representations is either the forward or backward null\nlight cone. The ones with positive energy (Theorem 26) yield only positive\nfrequencies and thus according to Planck's law have positive energy in the\nsense of field theory. We observe that solutions that extend to the total\ncompactification (i.e., steady state) can have their frequency spectrum constrained to a narrow band yielding background radiation that indicates a\ntemperature of 2.7 degrees Kelvin (or any other temperature for that matter). This says that although the actual steady state models to the universe\nthat fit the astronomical observations are complicated this work indicates\nthat there can be a background radiation that fits the measurements that is\nnot the outgrowth of an initial very high temperature source. We would also\nlike to point out that the big bang models for the universe have had difficulty\nfitting the observations also, leading to theories involving inflation and the\nreturn of the cosmological constant. An interesting alternative which is not\nunrelated to this paper can be found in [P] where the conformal structure\nis emphasized and time does almost cycle. There is also the chronometric\ntheory of [S].\nWe have also shown that these representations fit in larger contexts. However, although many of the results in this paper generalize to SO(n, 2), the\nbeautiful geometric structures that appear in the case n = 4 do not.\n\n33\n\n\fReferences\n[ BW] A. Borel and N.
