We derive an analytic expression\nfor the compression modulus. The shear modulus is evaluated numerically by\nusing both the Pearl interaction potential, valid in the limit of very thin film,\nand a potential for films of arbitrary thickness. A comparative study of the\nshear moduli is carried out.\nPACS numbers: 74.60.Ec, 74.60.Ge\n\nTypeset using REVTEX\n1\n\n\fThe problem of a vortex emerging perpendicularly to a surface of a superconductor was\nfirst considered by Pearl.1,2 He pointed out that the vortex-vortex interaction potential at the\nsurface of superconductors follows the power law 1/r (1/k in Fourier space) at large distances.\nThe Pearl interaction potential has been widely used to investigate the equilibrium3 and the\nelastic4 properties of the vortex lattice in superconducting films.\nIn this work we will show that in fact the Pearl interaction potential is capable of describing satisfactorily the superconducting properties of a very thin superconductor. However,\nwe will show that as the thickness of the film approaches the London penetration depth \u03bb,\nthe use of this potential may underestimate significantly the value of the shear modulus for\nsufficiently low induction.\nIt has been shown elsewhere5 that the energy of an ensemble of interacting vortices inside\na superconducting film of finite thickness d and the energy of the stray fields in the vacuum\nis given by\n\u03a62\nF = 0\n8\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\uf8f1\n\n\uf8fc\n\n\uf8fd\n2\nd2 k\n1 \uf8f2\nh\n\u0010 \u0011i |S(k)|2 .\nd\n+\n\uf8fe\n(2\u03c0)2 \u03bb2 \u03b12 \uf8f3\n\u03bb2 k\u03b1 \u03b1 + k coth \u03b1d\n2\u03bb\nq\n\nwhere k = (kx , ky ), k = kx2 + ky2 , \u03b1 =\nstructure factor is given by\n\nS(k) =\n\n\u221a\n\n(1)\n\nk 2 + \u03bb\u22122 , and \u03a60 is the quantum flux. The\n\nX\n\neik*Ri .\n\n(2)\n\ni\n\nHere Ri is the position of the ith vortex line. Note that this result should be valid for\nan ensemble of distorted vortices, that is, the positions of the vortices do not necessarily\ncorrespond to the equilibrium configuration. The first term inside Eq. (1) represents the\ninteraction energy of the vortex lines as if the surfaces were absent. The second term represents the surface energy associated to the magnetic energy of the stray field at the vacuum.\nNote that for k small (large r), \u03b12 \u223c 1/\u03bb2 . Thus, the surface energy goes as \u03a620 /8\u03c0 2 r.\nThis is the Pearl result for vortices emerging from a semi-infinite isotropic superconductor.1\nAnother interesting particular case of Eq. (1) is the limit of a very thin film, d \u2192 0, and k\nsmall. In this limit, from Eq. (1) it is straightforward to show that\nF = E0\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0d\ndk 2\n|S(k)|2 ,\n2\n\u22121\n(2\u03c0) k\u039b + k 2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere E0 = (\u03a60 /4\u03c0\u03bb)2 , \u039b = 2\u03bb2 /d. This is precisely the energy of an ensemble of interacting\nvortices in a very thin film first obtained by Pearl.2 However, his derivation is supposed to\nbe valid for any k. In this work we use Eq. (3) with no restriction on k.\nThe integrand of Eq. (1) contains two terms. The bulk term follows the power law 1/k 2\nfor large k. The integrand of Eq. (3) has the same behavior as its corresponding one. As\na result, the self-energy contributions to both Eqs. (1) and (3) diverge. The divergence is\nlogarithmic. This is so because London theory neglects the size of the vortex-core. To remove\nthis short-length scale divergence we use the Gaussian cutoff. This regularization procedure\n2 2\nconsists in multiplying the integrand of Eq. (1) and (3) by a factor e\u22122\u03be k , where \u03be is the\ncoherence length.7 In the first case, only the bulk term needs a cutoff.6 The London picture\nis valid in the limit of low induction and very strong type II superconductor, \u03ba = \u03bb/\u03be \u226b 1.\n2\n\n\fLet us suppose that initially the vortex lines are located at the equilibrium positions\n= (Xi0 , Yi0 ). Let us denote by ui \u2261 u(R0i ) the displacement of the ith vortex line from\nits equilibrium position. The new position of the ith vortex line is then given by Ri = R0i +ui .\nThe elastic energy of the distorted vortex lattice is most conveniently written in k-space by\nexpressing the displacement in terms of its Fourier transform\n\nR0i\n\nui =\n\nZ\n\nBZ\n\ndk 2 1\nk*R0i\nu(k)e\n,\n(2\u03c0)2 d\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the integration is taken over the first Brillouin zone (BZ) of the vortex lattice. Upon\ntaking this into Eq. (1) and expanding it up to second order in ui we obtain for the excess\nfree energy\n1 Z dk 2 1\n\u03b4F =\nu\u03b1 (k)\u03a6\u03b1\u03b2 (k)u\u03b2 (\u2212k) ,\n2\n(2\u03c0)2 d\n\n(5)\n\nwith (\u03b1, \u03b2) = (x, y). Here B = \u03a60 /A is the induction, A is the area of a unit cell of the\nR \u03c0/d\nvortex lattice. The factor 1/d = \u2212\u03c0/d dkz /(2\u03c0) in the integrals was introduced deliberately\nto resemble the three dimensional corresponding expressions. The coefficients \u03a6\u03b1\u03b2 (k), called\nelasticity matrix, are real, symmetric, and periodic in k-space. One has\n\u03a6\u03b1\u03b2 (k) =\n\nB2 X\n[(k + Q)\u03b1 (k + Q)\u03b2 V (k + Q) \u2212 Q\u03b1 Q\u03b2 V (Q)] ,\n4\u03c0 Q\n\n(6)\n\nwhere Q are the reciprocal lattice vectors. Although the last equation is valid for any type\nof vortex lattice, we will use a triangular lattice. The basis vectors of the reciprocal lattice\nare given by\n\u0177\n2\u03c0\nx\u0302 \u2212 \u221a\nQ1 =\na\n3\n\n!\n\n, Q2 =\n\n4\u03c0 \u0177\n\u221a\na 3\n\n(7)\n\n\u221a\nwhere a2 = 2\u03a60 / 3 B. Then, the vortex positions in reciprocal space are given by Q \u2261\nQmn = nQ1 + mQ2 , with m, n integers.\nThe interaction potential V (k) for a film of arbitrary thickness is\n\"\n\n2\n1\nV (k) = 2 2 1 + 2\n\u03bb\u03b1\nd\u03bb k\u03b1(k + \u03b1)\n\n#\n\n,\n\n(8)\n\nand in the limit of Pearl is\nV (k) =\n\n2\n.\nkd + \u03bb2 k 2\n\n(9)\n\nSince we have assumed that the vortex lines are straight and parallel to each other,\nthere will be only two elastic constants connected to the excitation of the lattice. One is\nthe compression modulus and the other one is the shear modulus. Usually, shear is softer\nthan compression. Let us first neglect the discreteness of the lattice by considering only the\nQ = 0 contribution to Eq. (6). Within this continuum approximation, only the compression\nmodulus is obtained. One has\n3\n\n\fc11 (k) =\n\nB2\nV (k) .\n4\u03c0\n\n(10)\n\nNote that in the long wave length limit, k \u2192 0, the interaction potential diverges, both\nfor the full expression and within the Pearl limit [see Eqs. (8) and (9)]. As a result, in this\nlocal limit the compression modulus diverges. Thus, as the vortex density becomes very\nsmall, the energy cost to compress the lattice is very large.\nThe evaluation of the more important shear modulus is possible only if one goes beyond\nthe continuum limit. Over the first Brillouin zone the shear modulus is nearly a constant,\nthat is, it does not contain any significant non-locality like the compression modulus.8 Thus,\neither of the following definitions is sufficient to describe the shear deformations\nc66 = lim\n\nk\u21920\n\n\u03a6yy (k, 0)\n\u03a6xx (0, k)\n, c66 = lim\n.\n2\nk\u21920\nk\nk2\n\n(11)\n\nIn what follows, the induction B is in units of the upper critical field Hc2, b = B/Hc2;\nlengths are in units of \u03bb; the Ginzburg-Landau parameter used is \u03ba = 50. By using these\nparameters we evaluated numerically cp66 and c66 , where the superscript p means that the\nPearl potential was used to calculate the shear modulus, whereas with no superscript we\nused the full expression of Eq. (8). Fig. 1 shows the ratio cp66 /c66 as a function of the\nfilm thickness. As one can see from this figure, for sufficiently low induction the difference\nbetween both shear modulus grows as d increases. Note that this occurs for values slightly\nlarger than \u03be. However, these differences tend to disappear as the induction increases.\nIn Fig. 2 we also show a plot of the ratio cb66 /c66 as a function of the film thickness, where\nthe superscript b stands for bulk. Note that as the induction increases the shear modulus\nthe bulk shear modulus becomes approximately equal to full shear modulus. This was first\nexperimentally observed by Fiory.9\nThe conclusion we draw from this scenario is that the Pearl potential is indeed valid in\nthe limit of very thin film. However, the study of the elastic properties of the vortex lattice\nin superconducting films, of thickness slightly larger than \u03be and the induction very close to\nthe lower critical field Hc1 , might become non-reliable by employing this potential. In this\nsituation it should be more convenient to use the full expression for the interaction potential,\nbut for films of thickness not much larger than \u03bb, because in this limit bending of the vortex\nlines may become important.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe author thanks the Brazilian Agencies FAPESP and CNPq for financial support.\n\n4\n\n\fREFERENCES\n1\n\nJ.
