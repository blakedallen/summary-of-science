A one dimensional marginal\nof the stationary\nthe distribution of the random variable\nP0\nPn solution is equal to Loynes' distribution,\nW = supn\u22650 i=1 X(i), where the empty sum i=1 X(i) is defined to be 0.\n\nWe are interested in estimating the tail behavior of Loynes' distribution. Consider the partial\nsums process {S(n)/n}, where S(n) := X(1) + * * * + X(n). Its associated scaled Cumulant\nGenerating Function (sCGF) \u03bb and associated Loynes' exponent \u03b8 \u2217 are defined as follows,\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\nlog E e\u03b8S(n) ,\nn\u2192\u221e n\n\n\u03bb(\u03b8) := lim\n\n\u03b8 \u2217 := sup(\u03b8 : \u03bb(\u03b8) \u2264 0).\n\n(1)\n\nIn an advance on the generality of earlier results, Glynn and Whitt [15, Theorem 1] proved the\nfollowing, which justifies the terminology Loynes' exponent.\nTheorem 1 ([15]) Assume that: (i) {X(n)} is strictly stationary; (ii) \u03bb(\u03b8) is finite in a neighborhood of \u03b8 \u2217 , differentiable at \u03b8 \u2217 with \u03bb(\u03b8 \u2217 ) = 0 and \u03bb\u2032 (\u03b8 \u2217 ) > 0; and (iii) that E(exp(\u03b8 \u2217 S(n)) <\n\u221e for all n \u2265 1.

The\nuniform bound, condition (iii), ensures that large W is caused by the cumulative behavior of a\ncollection of increments {X(n)} rather than a single exceedingly large increment.\nTheorem 1 is of practical interest as it says that, for large n and a sizeable collection of increment\n\u2217\nprocesses {X(n)}, P (W > n) \u223c e\u2212n\u03b8 . If \u03b8 \u2217 is known, this provides an estimate of the likelihood\nof long waiting times or large queue-lengths, and hence quality-of-service metrics. This has\ngenerated interest in estimating \u03b8 \u2217 on-the-fly from observations to predict queueing behavior in\nATM networks. For example, see early work of Courcoubetis et al. [4] and Duffield et al.

That is, for all Borel sets\n\u2212 inf \u25e6 J(x) \u2264 lim inf\nx\u2208B\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n1\n1\nlog P (\u03b8 \u2217 (n) \u2208 B) \u2264 lim sup log P (\u03b8 \u2217 (n) \u2208 B) \u2264 \u2212 inf J(x),\nn\nx\u2208B\u0304\nn\u2192\u221e n\n\n(3)\n\nwhere B \u25e6 denotes the interior of B and B\u0304 denotes the closure of B, and J : [0, \u221e] 7\u2192 [0, \u221e] is\na good rate function (lower semi-continuous and with compact level sets). Moreover, one can\nconstruct consistent estimates (J(x) = 0 if and only if x = \u03b8 \u2217 ).\nEquation (3) can be compared with [21, Proposition 11.3.4] or [10, Theorem 3]. The following\nis a corollary of the latter.\nProposition 1 ([10]) Suppose\nthat the sequence {X(n)} is i.i.d. with P (X(1) > 0) > 0 and\n\u0002\nassume that \u03bb(\u03b8) = log E e\u03b8X(1) ] is finite in a neighborhood of the origin. Then with\nSw (n) := W (1) + * * * + W (n),\n\nthe process {Sw (n)/n2 } satisfies the LDP with a good rate function J. That is,\nP\n\nn\nnX\ni=1\n\no\nW (i) > n2 x \u223c exp(\u2212nJ(x))\n\nwith J(0) = 0, J(x) > 0 for all x > 0, and J(x) < \u221e for some x > 0.\nConsequently, we are conjecturing that estimating the tail exponent of Loynes' distribution is\neasier than estimating its mean.\nEstimation schemes and rigorous evidence in support of the conjecture. A range of\napproaches to estimating \u03b8 \u2217 can be deduced from the literature. In increasing order of directness,\n\n\f3\nexamples include the following. (I) For the GI/G/1 queue, techniques have been developed for\nestimating the whole of Loynes' distribution [24] from which \u03b8 \u2217 can be deduced. (II) Estimators\nof the sCGF have been proposed that use either a frequentist approach if {X(n)} satisfies a\nmixing condition [6], or a Bayesian approach if {X(n)} is i.i.d. [12][14] or a Markov chain [23].\nFrom these, estimates of \u03b8 \u2217 can be obtained (c.f. [16]). (III) Direct extremal estimators based on\nobservations of the {W (n)}, such as log(n)/ max(1, W (1), . . . , W (n)), have been studied [3][26].\nOur limited rigorous evidence for the validity of Conjecture 1 is based on two frequentist sCGF\nestimation schemes. We show that the conjecture holds if the non-overlapping partial sums of\nthe increments {X(n)} are i.i.d. and bounded for a fixed block size. This result is deduced from\n[9]. Moving away from independence, we also present a new result: if {X(n)} forms a finite state\nirreducible Markov chain, then the conjecture holds. For the conjecture to be established in\ngenerality, new ideas are needed to extend to unbounded and non-independent increments that\ntake more than finite values, but - arguably - the unboundedness is more technically challenging.\nWe hope this will become apparent in the exposition that follows.\nThe first result is based on the estimation scheme proposed in [6]. For an integer B < \u221e,\nconstruct the blocked process\niB\nX\nX(j).\n(4)\nY (i) =\nj=(i\u22121)B+1\n\nSelect B sufficiently large that you believe the blocked process {Y (n)} is close to being i.i.d. If\nthe process {Y (n)} was i.i.d., then \u03bb(\u03b8) in equation (1) reduces to \u03bb(\u03b8) = B \u22121 log E(exp(\u03b8Y (1))).\nGiven observations X(1), . . . , X(n), this suggests using the MLE for \u03bb(\u03b8)\u2020 and \u03b8 \u2217 :\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u230an/B\u230b\nX\n1\n1\ne\u03b8Y (i) \uf8f8 and finally \u03b8 \u2217 (n) := sup{\u03b8 : \u03bb\u0302(n, \u03b8) \u2264 0}.\n\u03bb\u0302(n, \u03b8) := log \uf8ed\nB\n\u230an/B\u230b\ni=1\n\nA central limit theorem for {\u03b8 \u2217 (n)} is proved in [6]. As a corollary to a result regarding a related\nestimation problem, [9, Theorem 2] proves that the sequence of estimates {\u03b8 \u2217 (n)} satisfy the\nLDP under less restrictive conditions than those of the following theorem, but does not establish\nits consistency.\nTheorem 2 ([9]) If, for some B, {Y (i)} is i.i.d. and Y (i) takes values in a closed, bounded\nsubset \u03a3 of the real line that does not include an open ball around the origin, then Conjecture\n1 holds.\n\nA sketch of the proof of Theorem\n2 is as follows. By Sanov's Theorem, the empirical laws {L(n)},\nP\ndefined by L(n) := n\u22121 ni=1 1Y (i) for n \u2265 1, satisfy the LDP in M1 (\u03a3), the space of probability\nmeasures on \u03a3, equipped with the topology of weak convergence. If Y (1) has measure \u03bc, then\nthe good rate function for the LDP is the relative entropy H(\u03bd|\u03bc). As \u03a3 is bounded, for each\n\u03b8 \u2208 R the function x 7\u2192 exp(\u03b8x) is continuous and bounded. Thus if \u03bcn =\u21d2 \u03bc in M1 (\u03a3),\nthen log \u03bcn (exp(\u03b8x)) \u2192 log \u03bc(exp(\u03b8x)) in R. As point-wise convergence of convex functions\nimplies uniform convergence on bounded subsets, by the contraction principle {\u03bb\u0302(n, *)} satisfies\nthe LDP in the space of convex functions equipped with the topology of uniform convergence on\nbounded subsets. To obtain the LDP for the tail exponent estimates {\u03b8 \u2217 (n)}, one considers the\ncontinuity of \u03bb\u0302(n, *) 7\u2192 sup(\u03b8 : \u03bb\u0302(n, \u03b8) \u2264 0) and applies Puhalskii's extension of the contraction\nprinciple [25, Theorem 2.1]. As H(\u03bd|\u03bc) = 0 if and only if \u03bd = \u03bc, consistency follows from the\nvariational form of the rate function for {\u03b8 \u2217 (n)} that is given by the contraction principle.\nThe need to exclude Y (n) taking values in an open ball around the origin is due to an artifact\nof the estimation scheme. If Y (1) = * * * = Y (n) = 0, then \u03bb\u0302(n, \u03b8) = 0 for all \u03b8 and \u03b8 \u2217 (n) = \u221e.\n\u2020\n\nThis is known to be a biased estimator [13].\n\n\f4\nHowever, in the topologically nearby situation where Y (1) = Y (2) = * * * = Y (n) = \u01eb > 0,\n\u03b8 \u2217 (n) = 0. That is, the estimation scheme possesses a discontinuity and the assumption is\nimposed to avoid it.\nOur second result is based on a frequentist version of the estimator used in [23]. Consider a\nfinite state Markov chain {X(n)} with an irreducible transition matrix \u03a0 = (\u03c0i,j ) \u2208 [0, 1]M \u00d7M\nand taking values {f (1), . . . , f (M )}. For each \u03b8 \u2208 R, define the matrix \u03a0\u03b8 = \u03a0D\u03b8 , where D\u03b8\nis the matrix with diagonal entries exp(\u03b8f (1)), exp(\u03b8f (2)), . . . , exp(\u03b8f (M )) and all off-diagonal\nentries equal to zero. The sCGF of the partial sums process {S(n)/n} can be identified as\n\u03bb(\u03b8) = log \u03c1(\u03a0\u03b8 ), where \u03c1 is the spectral radius [5, Theorem 3.1.2]. With 0/0 := 0, this suggests\nthat one constructs the MLE for \u03a0, \u03a0\u0302(n), defined by\n!\n!\nn\nn\nX\nX\n\u03c0\u0302(n)i,j :=\n1{(X(k\u22121),X(k))=(i,j)} /\n1{X(k\u22121)=i} ,\nk=1\n\nk=1\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nand then estimates \u03bb(\u03b8) and \u03b8 \u2217 by \u03bb\u0302(n, \u03b8) = log \u03c1 \u03a0\u0302(n)\u03b8 and \u03b8 \u2217 (n) = sup(\u03b8 : \u03bb\u0302(n, \u03b8) \u2264 0).\n\nTheorem 3 If {X(n)} is a finite state Markov chain with an irreducible transition matrix \u03a0\nand f (i) 6= 0 for all i \u2208 {1, . . . , M }, then Conjecture 1 holds true.\n\nTheorem 3 follows the arguments of Theorem 2 once we establish that {\u03bb\u0302(n, *)} satisfies\nPn the LDP.\n\u22121\nBy [5, Theorem 3.1.13], the empirical laws of the transitions {L2 (n)}, L2 (n) := n\ni=1 1(X(n\u22121),X(n)) ,\nsatisfy the LDP in {(i, j) : \u03c0i,j > 0}. With \u03c6 = (\u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6M ) being the stationary distribution of\n\u03a0, the rate function defined by [5, equation (3.1.14)] is zero only at the values \u03c6i \u03c0i,j . If \u03c0i,j = 0,\nthen \u03c0\u0302(n)i,j = 0. For all (i, j) such that \u03c0i,j > 0, we have that \u03c0\u0302(n)(i,j) can be expressed as a\nratio of integrals against L2 (n):\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03c0\u0302(n)(i,j) = L2 (n)(1(x,y)=(i,j) ) / L2 (n)(1(x,y)=(i,*) ) .\n\nThus the estimate \u03a0\u0302(n) is a continuous construction from L2 (n) so that contraction principle\ncan be applied and the estimates {\u03a0\u0302(n)} satisfy the LDP with a rate function H : [0, 1]M \u00d7M 7\u2192\n[0, \u221e] that satisfies H(A) = 0 if and only if A = \u03a0. If the sequence of matrices An converge\nentry-wise to A, then by the continuous dependence of eigenvalues on entries [17], log \u03c1(An D\u03b8 )\nconverges to log \u03c1(AD\u03b8 ) point-wise for all \u03b8 and therefore uniformly on compact subsets of \u03b8.\nThus, from the contraction principle, {\u03bb\u0302(n, *)} satisfies the LDP and the rest of the proof follows\nas for Theorem 2.\n\nFollowing the logic in [9, Theorem 1], as an aside we note that based on either of these two\nestimation schemes one can construct estimates of the rate function for the partial sums process\n\u02c6 x) := sup\u03b8 (\u03b8x \u2212 \u03bb\u0302(n, \u03b8)), if {\u03bb\u0302(n, *)} satisfies the LDP, then it can be\n{S(n)/n}. Defining I(n,\n\u02c6 *)} satisfies the LDP in the space of R \u222a {\u221e} valued convex functions equipped\nshown that {I(n,\nwith the Attouch-Wets topology [1][2]. That is, there is a LDP for estimating large deviation\nrate functions and, under the conditions of Theorems 2 and 3, the estimates are consistent.\nExample. Assume that the increments process {X(n)} forms a two-state Markov chain on the\nstate space {\u22121, +1} with transition matrix\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03b1\n1\u2212\u03b1\n\u03b2\n1\u2212\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u2217\n,\nand \u03b8 = log\n,\n\u03a0=\n.\nThen, \u03c6 =\n\u03b2\n1\u2212\u03b2\n\u03b1+\u03b2 \u03b1+\u03b2\n1\u2212\u03b2\nwhere 0 < \u03b1 < \u03b2 < 1. The sequence {\u03a0\u0302(n)} satisfies the LDP with a good rate function\nH. It can be deduced from [5, equation (3.1.14)] and the variational expression given by the\ncontraction principle that H is finite only at matrices of the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\u2212a\na\nA=\n, where a, b \u2208 (0, 1)\nb\n1\u2212b\n\n\f5\nJ (x)\n0.04\n\n0.03\n\n0.02\n\n0.01\n\nx\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\nFigure 1: Rate function for {\u03b8 \u2217 (n)} based on frequentist Markov chain estimator.

For the conjecture to be substantiated,\nthe conditions under which Theorems 2 and 3 hold need to be significantly extended to cope\nwith more general dependence structure of the increments and, perhaps more challengingly, to\nremove the boundedness assumptions. A prototypical example of the later is where Lindley's\nrecursion describes the waiting times at the D/M/1 queue. That is, the increments {X(n)} are\ni.i.d. with P (X(1) > x + 1/\u03b2) = exp(\u2212\u03b1x) for x \u2265 \u2212\u03b2 \u22121 and \u03b1 > \u03b2. This example satisfies the\nconditions of Theorem 1 with \u03b8 \u2217 (< \u03b1) being the positive solution of the transcendental equation\nlog (\u03b1/(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b8 \u2217 )) \u2212 \u03b8 \u2217 /\u03b2 = 0,\n\n(5)\n\nwhich can be readily solved numerically.\nThis example is delicate because the tail of increments decay exponentially, albeit with a larger\nexponent than \u03b8 \u2217 . Even though this example breaks the hypotheses of Theorem 2, we can\nimplement the estimation scheme in [6] and see how it performs. Fixing B = 1, for a single\nrealization X(1), . . . , X(50, 000) the left hand side of Figure 2 plots \u03b8 \u2217 (n) as a function of n as\nwell as the actual Loynes' exponent \u03b8 \u2217 solving (5). This plot indicates that the estimates are\nconverging to the correct value. The right-hand plot is an attempt to consider the existence of\nan LDP. For 2 \u00d7 105 independent simulations and a range of values of x, it plots n\u22121 times the\nlogarithm of the number of samples such that \u03b8\u02c6\u2217 (n) \u2212 \u03b8 \u2217 > x, which we expect to converge to\nthe rate function for the tail exponent estimates. This figure is suggestive of the existence of\nan LDP despite the departure from the boundedness conditions in Theorems 2 and 3.\nFurther questions. Conjecture 1 is challenging, but Theorem 1 has been extended considerably so that more difficult questions can be asked. In a development of the sCGF approach\nin [15], [7] considers the case where the partial sums {S(n)/n} satisfy the LDP at a non-linear\nspeed. By reconsidering the general scaling problem in terms of rate functions rather than\nsCGFs [8, Theorem 2.2] extends the results further while also correcting a lacuna (the omission\nof an assumption in the vein of Theorem 1 (iii)).\n\n\f6\n\n0.24\n\nx = 0.01\nx = 0.02\nx = 0.03\nx = 0.04\nx = 0.05\n\n\u2212n\u22121 log P \u03b8\u2217 (n) \u2212 \u03b8\u2217 > x\n\n0.23\n\n0.07\n\n0.22\n0.06\n0.21\n0.05\n\n0.2\n\n\u03b8\u2217 (n)\n\n0.19\n\n0.04\n\n\u03b8\n\n0.18\n\n\u2217\n\n0.03\n\n0.17\n0.02\n0.16\n0.01\n\n0.15\n\nn\n\nn\n0.14\n0\n\n10000\n\n20000\n\n30000\n\n40000\n\n50000\n\n0\n6000\n\n6500\n\n7000\n\n7500\n\n8000\n\n8500\n\n9000\n\n9500\n\n10000\n\nFigure 2: D/M/1 queue with \u03b1 = 1 and \u03b2 = 10/11, giving \u03b8 \u2217 \u2248 0.176.
