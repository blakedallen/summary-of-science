Buldyrev 1 and H. Eugene Stanley\nCenter for Polymer Studies and Department of Physics\nBoston University, Boston, MA 02215, USA\n\nAbstract\nWe study a three-dimensional system of particles interacting via sphericallysymmetric pair potentials consisting of several discontinuous steps. We show that at\ncertain values of the parameters desribing the potential, the system has three firstorder phase transitions between fluids of different densities ending in three critical\npoints.\n\nMuch attention has been focused on the topic of liquid-liquid phase transitions [1]. Recently a liquid-liquid phase transition was found experimentally\nin phosphorus [2]. Liquid-liquid phase transitions also can exist in other materials with tetrahedral symmetry such as carbon [3,4], silica, [5] and silicon\n[6,7].\nThe possibility of a sharp amorphous-amorphous transition between low density amorphous ice (LDA) and high density amorphous ice (HDA) has been\nknown for a long time [8]. Computer simulations of the ST2 water model\n[9] suggest that the transition line between LDA and HDA can be extended\nto higher temperatures above the glass transition, where it would become\na first order liquid-liquid phase transition line ending at a critical point at\nabout 200K [10]. However, in this temperature range, water immediately crystallizes and this phase transition cannot be observed in direct experiments.\nMore recently, a distinct amorphous phase of water, called very high-density\namorphous ice, has been observed experimentally [11\u201313]. New simulations of\nthe ST2 model [14] in the restricted NPT ensemble suggest that instead of\none previously observed liquid-liquid phase transition, there might be three\nliquid-liquid phase transition lines between four liquids with different densities roughly corresponding to the densities of the three known amorphous\nices. It has been suggested [15] that systems with rich polymorphic solid phase\n1\n\nbuldyrev@bu.edu\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Science\n\nbs.tex\n\n4 April 2003\n\n\fdiagrams may have several liquid phases with local particle arrangements corresponding to various crystalline structures.\nWe propose here a simple model with at least two liquid-liquid phase transitions in addition to the known liquid-gas phase transition. This model is based\non the double step soft-core potential model previously used to study systems\nwith two fluid-fluid critical points [16\u201319]. Two fluid-fluid critical points were\nalso observed by Monte Carlo simulations of a similar model with a continuous\nsoft-core potential [20].\nWe perform constant volume V collision-driven molecular dynamic simulations\n[17,18,21] on a system of N = 1728 spherically symmetric particles interacting\nvia the discontinuous pair potential\n\nU(r) =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u221e\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nU\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 1\n\uf8f2\n\nU2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 \u2212UA\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f30\n\nfor r < a\nfor a \u2264 r < b1\n(1)\n\nfor b1 \u2264 r < b2\nfor b2 \u2264 r < c\nfor c \u2264 r\n\n,\n\nwhere U(r) is a potential energy of a pair of particles at distance r, UA > 0\nis the energy of attraction, U1 = 3UA , U2 = UA , b1 = 1.4a, b2 = 2.1a, and\nc = 2.8a. (see Figure 1, inset). We keep temperature T constant using a modified Berendsen method and compute pressure P the same way as in [16,17],\naveraging it over 2 * 104 (ma2 /UA )1/2 time units, where m is particle mass.\nThroughout this paper, we measure density, pressure, and temperature in\nunits of a\u22123 , UA a\u22123 , and UA /kB , respectively, where kB is the Boltzmann constant. We investigate several state points for systems with different densities\n\u03c1 \u2261 N/V along several isotherms (see Fig. 1) and find three distinct sets of\nvan der Waals loops, each ending in a specific critical point characterized by\nan isotherm with an inflection point.\nNote that the isotherm for T = 0.60 almost entirely corresponds to a stretched\nmetastable liquid with P < 0. In addition, at this temperature, the system\nspontaneously crystallizes for \u03c1 > 0.23. Nevertheless, we are able to find equilibrium liquid pressures by averaging pressure before the crystallization onset,\nusing the same technique as in [17]. We quench five independent configurations\nequilibrated at T=0.9 to T=0.6, skip initial 800 time units (the correlation\ntime at this temperature), and average the pressure until the onset of crystallization, indicated by the sharp decrease of potential energy. The average\nexistence time hti of the metastable liquid is hti = 1.5 * 104 time units at\n\u03c1 = 0.23 , hti = 4.5 * 103 at \u03c1 = 0.25, hti = 1.5 * 103 at \u03c1 = 0.27, and hti = 103\n2\n\n\f3\n\nPa /UA\n0.2\n\nT=0.59\nT=0.6\nT=0.61\nT=0.65\nT=0.70\nT=0.75\nT=0.80\nT=1.10\n\nU(r)/UA\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\nr/a\n\n\u22121\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n0.1\nC2\n\nC1\n\nC3\n\n0.0\n\n\u22120.1\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n\u03c1a\n\n3\n\nFig. 1. Isotherms and critical points for the system of spherically symmetric particles\ninteracting via the potential shown as an inset.\n\nat \u03c1 = 0.30. The error bars of the pressure are assumed to be equal to the\nstandard deviation of the pressure measurements for five independent runs.\nAccordingly, we find a liquid-gas critical point C1 at T1 = 1.10, P1 = 0.014,\n\u03c11 = 0.054, a stable high density critical point C2 at T2 = 0.75, P2 = 0.0056,\n\u03c12 = 0.152, and a third very high density critical point C3 at T3 = 0.60,\nP3 = \u22120.014, \u03c13 = 0.245. The third critical point is metastable with respect\nto gas-crystal coexistence, and by varying the parameters of the potential [19],\none should be able to shift the position of the third critical point to a stable\nregion of the phase diagram.\nFigure 2 shows radial distribution functions for the three liquids at temperature T = 0.59, corresponding to the low density liquid (LDL) with density\n0.098a\u22123 , high density liquid (HDL) with density 0.186a\u22123 , very high density\nliquid (VHDL) with density 0.272a\u22123 and a crystal with density 0.296a\u22123. One\ncan see a dramatic difference between the structures of LDL and HDL.\nIntegrating radial distribution function for LDL, we find that 11 neighbors\nstay in the attractive well, almost not penetrating into soft cores.\nIn contrast, in HDL, particles penetrate into a larger soft core. The average\nnumber of neighbors in the smaller soft core is 0.6. The average number of\nneighbors in the larger soft core is 2.7.

Radial distribution functions for a system shown in Fig. 1 at temperature\nT = 0.59 at four different densities, corresponding to three different liquids and a\ncrystal.\n\nwell also increases to 17.\nThe difference between the structures of HDL and VHDL is less pronounced.\nNevertheless, one can see the development of an extra peak for VHDL at a\ndistance 3.5a. In addition, the number of particles in the smaller and larger\nsoft cores increases to 1 and 5, respectively, and the number of particles in the\nattractive well increases to 23.\nThe choice of parameters is motivated by our preliminary studies of simpler systems with U1 = \u221e, which have a gas-liquid critical point C\u03031 ( T =\n1.06, P = 0.013, \u03c1 = 0.052) and a stable liquid-liquid critical point C\u03032\n(T = 0.67, P = 0.059, \u03c1 = 0.144 ) (see Fig. 3). The potential of this system\nis the soft-core potential [16], with b1 playing the role of the hard core and\nb2 playing the role of the soft core. Note that the positions of these critical\npoints are very similar to those of C1 and C2 in the three-step potential. Thus,\nadding a second soft core a < b1 < b2 to the potential, creates a third critical\npoint at higher densities without a significant change in the position of the\ntwo original critical points.\nOne can speculate that adding more steps to a potential can create more\ncritical points at different densities corresponding to the interparticle distances\nof these steps if the parameters of these steps are carefully selected.\n4\n\n\fPa /UA\n\n3\n\nT=0.6\nT=1.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\nT=1.5\n\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\u22121\n\n0.0\n\nU(r)/UA\nr/a\n1\n\n\u22120.1\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n\u03c1a\n\n3\n\n0.2\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n0.3\n\nFig. 3.

The isotherm corresponding to\nT = 1.00 is computed for the entire range of densities. The systems for \u03c1 > 0.23\nspontaneously crystallize at T < 0.75 into crystalline structures similar to to the\ncrystalline structure of the system with two soft cores shown in Fig. 2.\n\nIn summary, we show that systems interacting via spherically symmetric potentials with three characteristic repulsive distances playing the role of soft\ncores may have three liquid phases of three increasing densities characterized\nby the penetration of particles into a soft core of smaller diameter.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank V.
