Introduction\nThe imaging atmospheric Cherenkov technique\n(IACT) was developed at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO) resulting in the first very\nhigh energy (VHE; E > 100 GeV) detection of the\nCrab nebula in 1989 [1]. In the twenty years since\nthat first publication there have been VHE detections\nof over 100 objects including pulsars, blazars, pulsar\nwind nebula, supernova remnants and starburst galaxies. Since VHE photons do not penetrate the atmosphere , IACT telescopes measure the Cherenkov light\ngenerated by particle showers initiated by the primary photons interacting with our atmosphere. This\nCherenkov light appears as a two dimensional ellipse\nwhen imaged by an IACT telescope camera. The\nshape and orientation of the ellipse in the camera indicate whether the shower was initiated by a gamma\nray or by a cosmic ray which can also cause a particle\nshower.\nThe current generation of IACT instruments involve\narrays of telescopes. The addition of multiple telescopes allows for a more accurate determination of the\nshower parameters. One of the most powerful aspects\nof this technique is that the light pool of the shower defines the collection area (\u223c 10, 000 m2 ) which is more\nthan adequate to compensate for the low flux of VHE\ngamma rays. Currently there are four major experiments in operation, HESS, an array of four IACT telescopes located in Namibia, MAGIC, an array of two\ntelescopes located in the Canary Islands, VERITAS\nin southern Arizona and CANGAROO in Australia.\nMAGIC just completed a major upgrade by adding\na single telescope and stereo trigger and HESS is in\nthe process of building an additional very large telescope. This contribution details part of the ongoing\nupgrade program being undertaken by the VERITAS\ncollaboration.\nVERITAS [2, 3] is an array of four 12 m diameeConf C091122\n\nter IACT telescopes located in southern Arizona at\nthe FLWO at an altitude of 1268 m. VERITAS detects photons from astrophysical sources at energies\nbetween 100 GeV and 30 TeV. The VERITAS telescopes consist of four identical alt-az mounted DaviesCotton reflectors with an f number of 1.0. The mirror\narea is approximately 106 m2 . Mounted in the focal\nplane is a camera made up of 499 pixels consisting of\n28 mm Photonis phototubes. VERITAS has a three\nlevel trigger, the first at the pixel level, the second is\na pattern trigger which triggers when any three adjacent pixels trigger. Finally, an array trigger fires if any\n2 or more telescopes trigger within a set time frame.\nFor more details on the VERITAS hardware, see [3].\nFor historical reasons, Telescopes 1 and 4 were\nerected in close (\u223c35 m) proximity. Even though\nVERITAS met all of its original design specifications,\nthis resulted in a significant collection area overlap\nand increased background due to cosmic rays and local muons. In fact, all of the published VERITAS\nanalysis included a cut that rejected events that only\ntriggered Telescopes 1 and 4. Simulations performed\nin the summer of 2008 suggested up to a 15% improvement in sensitivity if Telescope 1 was moved \u223c200 m\neastward from its initial position. Assuming that Telescopes 1 and 4 are redundant and can be considered\na single telescope, a 1/3 improvement is expected by\nadding an additional telescope.\nBased on these data, it was decided to relocate Telescope 1 to a more ideal location providing a more symmetrical layout to the VERITAS array (see Figures 1\nand 2). It was decided to relocate Telescope 1 instead of Telescope 4 to allow for the refurbishment of\nthe oldest telescope in the array which was originally\ninstalled at the FLWO as a prototype in 2002. The\nrelocation of Telescope 1 is part of an ongoing upgrade\nprogram [4] which recently included an improvement\nin the optical point spread function (PSF) [5]. The improvement in the optical PSF was accomplished using\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\n2009 Fermi Symposium, Washington, D.C., Nov. 2-5\n\nFigure 1: aerial view of the new VERITAS array layout with Telescope 1 relocated to the front of the FLWO\nadministrative complex. The original array layout position is marked in blue while the new one is in red. Note the\nshort distance (35m) between the original Telescope 1 position and the position of Telescope 4.\n\na novel mirror alignment system which resulted in a\n25 - 30% improvement in the PSF. This optical PSF\nimprovement also contributes to the enhancement in\nsensitivity discussed here and cannot be disentangled\nfrom the overall results. The move of Telescope 1\ncombined with the improvement in the optical PSF\nhas resulted in making VERITAS the most sensitive\nVHE telescope array in the world capable of detected\na 1% crab nebula signal in less than 30 hours.\n\nT3\nT4\nT1\n\nT1\nT2\n\nSince VERITAS does not operate during the summer months (approximately July through August),\nthe move of Telescope 1 was scheduled to take place\nduring this time to minimize the impact on the observing program. Telescope 1 was shutdown 6 weeks\nearly (May 4, 2009) so that it would be operational\nby the first of October. The move was completed on\nSeptember 4, 2009 and is estimated to have taken 2600\nperson hours of labor. Ten days later on the 14th\nscheduled operations began with the full array, over\ntwo weeks earlier than expected. By September 17th\nnormal operations had resumed. In total, VERITAS\nonly lost 6 weeks of full four telescope operations and\nthese were with the old array layout. The final array\nlayout, while not entirely symmetric, is a much better layout for a VHE instrument. Figure 1 shows an\naerial view of the VERITAS array with the old layout\nshown in blue and the new layout in red. While the\nold layout had inter-telescope distances ranging from\n35 m to 127 m, the new layout distances range from\n81 m to 127 m. Figure 2 shows a schematic representation of the array viewed from directly above. Also\nshown as a black arrow is the relocation of Telescope\n1.\neConf C091122\n\nFigure 2: Schematic of the array as viewed from directly\noverhead. The blue lines are for the original array layout\nwhile the red are for the new array layout. The black\narrow indicates the relocation of Telescope 1. The small\ngrid squares are 5 m on a side.\n\n2. Results\nVERITAS data are calibrated and cleaned initially\nas described in [6]. After calibration several noisereducing cuts are made. The VERITAS standard\nanalysis consists of parametrization using a moment\nanalysis [7] and following this, the calculation of scaled\nparameters are used for event selection [8, 9]. This selection consists of different sets of gamma-ray cuts,\ndetermined a priori. Depending on the strength and\nexpected spectral index of a source, different cuts are\nchosen. For example, a source with the strength of\nthe Crab would use a looser set of cuts than a week\nsource at the 1% Crab flux level. These two sets of\ncuts are called loose and hard cuts. Additionally, soft\nand standard versions of these cuts are used for soft\n(approximately spectral indices of 3 and above) or\n\n\fFigure 3: The time needed to detected a source at the 5\n\u03c3 level vs. that source's flux in units of the Crab\nNebula's flux. This is shown for the original array layout\nand for the new array layout with two different sets of\nevent selection cuts. Note that it would take 48 hours to\ndetect a 1% Crab source with the original array layout\nand only 28 hours with the new array layout.\n\nstandard (Crab-like 2.5 spectral index sources). The\nchoice of which cuts to use are determined prior to the\nanalysis. Figure 3 shows the observation time needed\nto detect an object at the 5 standard deviation (\u03c3)\nlevel. Before the relocation of Telescope 1, a 1% Crab\nflux source could be detected in 48 hours while after\nthe move it only takes 28 hours loose cuts. Similarly,\nit takes 72 seconds to detect the Crab nebula after\nthe move with hard cuts, as opposed to 108 seconds\nbefore the move.\nAnother way of looking at the sensitivity of VHE\ninstruments is to calculate the integral flux sensitivity\nabove a energy threshold. Shown in Figure 4 are the\nintegral flux sensitivity vs. Energy Threshold for several different instruments. In red is the original VERITAS layout while the new VERITAS layout is shown\nin black (based on Crab observations; the dashed sections are under evaluation). The integral flux sensitivity of VERITAS above 300 GeV is \u223c 30% better\nafter the move. This corresponds directly to a 60%\nreduction in the time needed to detect a source (for\nexample, a 50 hour observation before the move is\nequivalent to a 30 hour post move observation). For\ncomparison are shown the initial HESS sensitivity [10]\nshown as the blue dashed line (note that this is the\noriginal HESS sensitivity curve before any mirror reflectivity degradations). The integral sensitivity of\na single MAGIC-I1 telescope is shown as the green\ndashed line. Another thing to note is that the sensitivity of VERITAS has slightly degraded at the lower\nend due to the loss of sensitivity to the lowest energy\nshowers.\nFigure 5 shows the energy resolution of the VERITAS array as well as the angular resolution.

Summary\nThe VERITAS collaboration relocated Telescope 1\nand dramatically improved the optical PSF during the\nsummer of 2009 as part of an ongoing upgrade program. These studies indicate that the upgrades have\nimproved the sensitivity of VERITAS by 30% resulting in a 60% change in the time needed to detect a\nsource. The higher sensitivity achieved with VERITAS allows the detection of more objects in a shorter\namount of time, effectively doubling the observation\ntime. The ability to detect marginal sources such as\nM82 and to do deep observations of known objects has\ndrastically improved.\nIn addition to the telescope relocation and optical PSF improvements, there are several other upgrade plans being discussed which are described in [4]\nand are planned to be implemented in the next few\nyears. These upgrade plans include the installation of\nhigher efficiency photon detectors which would result\nin a 17% improvement in the sensitivty of the array\nand/or the installation of a topological trigger which\nwould consist of transmitting image parameters from\nthe camera directly to the array trigger allowing for\n\n\f4\n\n2009 Fermi Symposium, Washington, D.C., Nov. 2-5\n\nFigure 5: Left: the energy resolution of VERITAS vs. simulated energy at 70 degrees.

In addition to these baseline upgrades, the expansion of the array by adding more telescopes or an\nactive mirror alignment system is also possible. This\nongoing upgrade program, beginning with the optical\nPSF improvement and the relocation of Telescope 1\nwill continue to make VERITAS competitive in the\ncoming decade.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis research is supported by grants from the\nU.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. National Science Foundation, and the Smithsonian Institution, by\nNSERC in Canada, by PPARC in the UK and by\nScience Foundation Ireland.
