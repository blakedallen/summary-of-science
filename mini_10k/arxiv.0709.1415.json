These\nresults are related to recent experiments with excitons in single and double quantum\nwells.\n\nMany researchers in semiconductor physics talk of \"the\" Mott transition density\nin a system of excitons and electron-hole plasma, but do not have a clear handle\non exactly how to predict that density as a function of temperature and material\nparameters in a given system. While numerical studies have been performed for the\nfraction of free carriers as a function of carrier density and temperature [1, 2], these\ndo not give a readily-accessible intuition for the transition. In this paper I present a\nsimple approach which does not involve heavy numerical methods, but is still fairly\nrealistic. The theory is based on two well-known approximations, which are the massaction equation for equilibrium in when different species can form bound states, and\nthe static (Debye) screening approximation. In addition, simple approximations are\nused for numerical calculations of the excitonic Rydberg as a function of screening\nlength.\n\n1\n\nTwo \"Mott\" transitions\n\nThe first issue to deal with is what Mott transition we are concerned with. There are\nactually two very different conductor-insulator transitions which go under the name of\nthe \"Mott\" transition. The first, originally envisioned by Mott, occurs when the wave\nfunction overlap of bound states increases to the point that banding occurs. This Mott\ntransition is relevant in the case of doping of semiconductors\u2013 when the doping density\nincreases beyond a certain point, a mini-band generated from the dopant states will\narise, in which case the dopant carriers are no longer localized but instead can move\nin Bloch-like delocalized states. The condition for this is rs \u223c a, where a is the\ncharacteristic length over which the bound state wave function extends, and rs is the\naverage distance between bound states. If we cube both sides of this, we obtain the\n\n1\n\n\fcondition, for a three-dimensional system,\nn \u223c a3 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere n is the density of dopant electrons.\nThis Mott transition condition is equivalent to the condition that the Fermi level of\nthe electrons, if they were not in bound states, is much larger than the binding energy\nin the bound states. We can see this by assuming hydrogenic bound states. In this\ncase a is given by the Bohr radius,\na=\n\n4\u03c0\u000fh\u03042\n,\ne2 m\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u000f is the zero-frequency dielectric constant of the medium and m is the effective\nmass of the bound carrier (MKS is used everywhere in this paper). The hydrogenic\nRydberg for the bound state is\ne2\n.\n(3)\nRy =\n8\u03c0\u000fa\nBy comparison, the Fermi energy for a three-dimensional\nelectron gas with two spin\nR EF\nstates, determined by the condition N = 0 D(E)dE, where D(E) is the density of\nstates, is\n\"\n#2/3\n(3\u03c0 2 ) h\u03043\nEF = n \u221a\n,\n(4)\n2 m3/2\nwhere n is the electron density. If the Fermi energy is much larger than the Rydberg\nenergy, e.g. 10 times greater, we have\n(3\u03c0 2 )\nn \u221a\n2\n(3\u03c0 2 )\n2a n \u221a\n2\n\n!2/3\n\n!2/3\n\nh\u03042\nm\n\n= 10\n\n4\u03c0\u000fh\u03042\ne2 m\n\n= 10\n\nor\n\ne2\n8\u03c0\u000fa\n\n10\n\u223c 1.\n6\u03c0 2\nEssentially, if the Fermi level is large compared to the binding energy in the bound\nstates, the binding energy becomes just a perturbation on the Fermi gas. Since the\nFermi gas is a conductor, the Coulomb binding energy has little effect on that. To put\nit another way, Fermi phase space filling effects, which lead to a Fermi level, become\nimportant when there is substantial wave function overlap of the electrons, which is\nthe same point at which banding occurs.\nBy contrast, there is another, thermodnamic insulator-conductor transition which is\nsometimes also called the Mott transition, although Rice has named it the \"ionization\ncatastrophe.\" [3] This is usually the relevant transition for photoexcited carriers when\nthe excited carrier density is low enough that there is no Fermi level, which is to say,\nthe chemical potential is below the ground state energy. In this case, depending on\nthe temperature, there can still be a conductor-insulator transition from the carriers\nmostly in excitons to the carriers mostly in plasma. The transition in this case comes\nabout due to screening out of the Coulomb interaction which leads to formation of\nna3 =\n\n2\n\n\fexcitons, not due to wave function overlap. The general condition is a \u223c l, where l\nis the screening length, which enters into the screened Coulomb (Yukawa) potential,\nU (r) = q 2 e\u2212r/l /r. The screening length depends on the density; in the low-density\nlimit in three dimensions it is given by the Debye screening formula (e.g. [4])\n1\ne2 n\n=\n.\nl2\n\u000fkB T\n\n(5)\n\nWe can envision this transition in two different directions. If we start with a fully\nionized, high-density neutral plasma, and reduce the density while keeping the temperature constant (as, for example, typically happens due to carrier recombination) then\nan instability will occur when the total pair density drops to a point such that the\nscreening length is long compared to the excitonic Bohr radius, and exciton formation\nis no longer screened out. Then essentially all the carriers can form into excitons. The\ncondition for this is found by reversing the above formula, assuming a is a constant:\nn=\n\n\u000fkB T\n.\na2 e 2\n\n(6)\n\nOn the other hand, we can imagine starting with a low density gas of only excitons.\nSince excitons are neutral, we do not expect them to contribute to screening, at least\nnot until their density is high enough that there is substantial wave function overlap,\nwhich is the condition (1) above. However, long before they reach this density, free\nelectrons and holes can be generated by thermal ionization. These free carriers can\nleading to screening, which can lead to a reduced exciton binding energy, which in\nturn leads to further ionization. At some critical density this can become a runaway\nprocess known as the ionization catastrophe, or a thermodynamic Mott transition. To\ndetermine the condition for this, we must start with the mass-action equation, or Saha\nequation, for the number of free carriers in equilibrium,\n(e) (h)\n\nnQ nQ \u2212Ry/k T\nn2e\nB\n=\ne\n(ex)\nnex\nnQ\n\n(7)\n\nwhere ne is the density of free electrons (equal to the number of free holes), nex is\nthe density of excitons, and the other factors are the effective density of states factors,\ndefined by\nZ\n\u221e\n\n(i)\n\nnQ =\n\nDi (E)e\u2212E/kB T dE,\n\n(8)\n\n0\n\nwhere Di (E) is the density of states for species i, which depends in general on its band\nmass mi and spin degeneracy. The mass-action equation follows straightforwardly\nfrom the equilibrium condition that the chemical potentials for the different species in\na chemical reaction must balance, that is, \u03bce + \u03bch = \u03bcex , and from the Maxwellian\n(low-density) formula for the total density,\n(i)\n\nni = e\u2212(Ei \u2212\u03bc)/kB T nQ ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere Ei is the ground state energy of species i, and from the definition of the binding\nenergy Ry = (Ec \u2212 Ev ) \u2212 Eex . Number conservation requires that nex + ne = n, where\nn is the total pair density at any point in time.\n\n3\n\n\fTo find the critical density, we set the free carrier density ne to the value (6) above,\ninstead of the total density. Above this density, screening will make exciton formation\nimpossible. Assuming Ry is constant and ne \u001c nex , so that n \u2248 nex , this means the\ncritical density for the transition is approximately\n\u0012\n\nn=\n(e) (h)\n\n\u000fkB T\na2 e2\n\n\u00132 Ry/kB T\ne\n\nnQ\n\n,\n\n(10)\n\n(ex)\n\nwhere nQ = nQ nQ /nQ . This critical density, for starting at low density and going\nup, clearly gives a very different threshold than (6) above, for starting at high density\nand going down. For example, at low temperature, very few excitons will ionize and\ntherefore the critical density becomes exponentially large. Of course, at some point the\nFermi-level Mott transition density (1) will be reached. In general, though, the density\npredicted by (10) is well below the density predicted by (1).\nThe difference between (6) and (10) depending on whether the system is starting\nwith excitons or neutral plasma leads to the possibility of hysteresis, that is, the possibility that the ionized fraction of excitons can depend not only on the total excitation\ndensity and temperature of the carrier gas, but also on its history. This possibility\nwas first presented in Ref. [5] and has been recently revived by Portnoi [6] for twodimensional systems; experimental evidence has been reported in Ref. [7].\nAs seen in this short survey, talking of the Mott transition density is nontrivial.\nThe conductor-insulator transition in a carrier gas depends on density, temperature,\nthe depth of the bound states, and the history of the system.\n\n2 Self-consistent calculations for a three-dimensional\nsystem\nIn this section we ignore the possibility of hysteresis and ask for the prediction of\nthe mass-action equation for the fraction of ionized carriers as a function of density\nand temperature. If we are to be self-consistent, we must account for the fact that the\nbinding energy used in the mass-action equation (7) can depend on density through the\ndensity-dependent screening length. A very useful approximation, based on numerical\ncalculations [8], is\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\uf8f1\n2\n\uf8f2 Ry(0) 1 \u2212\n, l/a > 1\nRy(l) =\n1 + l/a\n\uf8f3\n\n(11)\n\nl/a \u2264 1,\n\n0,\n\nwhere l is the screening length. Using this formula, and equation (5) for the screening\nlength, we can rewrite (7) using number conservation as\nn2e = (n \u2212 ne )nQ e\u2212Ry(ne ,T )/kB T ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhich can be solved for ne .\nIt turns out that we must adjust this equation slightly. The mass-action equation\n(7) breaks down in the limit Ry \u2192 0, which is exactly the limit we are interested in for\nthe ionization catastrophe. This is easily seen by solving for nex when Ry = 0, which\ngives nex = n2e /nQ , which is not zero. We expect, however, that the number of excitons\n\n4\n\n\fvanishes when the exciton binding energy is zero. The reason for the breakdown is that\nexciton states with extremely shallow binding are still counted as exciton states, when\nin reality such states would be unstable, with very large orbits, and electrons and holes\nin such orbits would be indistinguishable in practice from free electrons and holes. As\na first-order correction, one can subtract from nex the fraction of excitons which are\nin states with energy greater than Ry, namely a fraction equal to e\u2212Ry/kB T , in which\ncase the mass-action equation becomes\n(e) (h)\n\nnQ nQ e\u2212Ry/kB T\nne nh\nnQ\n= (ex)\n,\n= Ry/k T\nB\nnex\ne\n\u22121\nnQ (1 \u2212 e\u2212Ry/kB T )\n\n(13)\n\nwhich has the expected behavior that nex \u2192 0 when Ry \u2192 0. Much theoretical\neffort has been given, especially in the astrophysics community, to justifying this approach more rigorously, for example using Planck-Larkin partition functions, which\ngive higher-order corrections [9, 10].\nUsing this adusted mass-action equation, we then have\nn2e\n\n\u0012\n\n+ ne\n\nnQ\neRy(ne ,T )/kB T\n\n\u0013\n\n\u22121\n\n\u2212\n\nnnQ\nRy(n\n,T\n)/kB T\ne\ne\n\n\u22121\n\n= 0.\n\n(14)\n\nIf Ry(ne , T ) is taken as a constant, then this equation can be solved simply as a\nquadratic equation. This leads to a value for ne which can then be used to recompute\nthe value of Ry(ne , T ). This leads to an iterative process to converge on a self-consistent\nvalue of ne . This iteration converges very rapidly, typically in less than 10 iterations.\nThese formulas can be simply programmed in a conditional loop to generate the curves\nshown in this paper.\nFigure 1 shows the fraction of free carriers in bulk GaAs, with the expected behavior\nthat the fraction increases toward 100% as temperature is increased and the excitons\nionize. For simplicity we assume that all holes have the light hole mass; the presence\nof heavy holes will give a correction but not a substantial change to the forms of the\ncurves. The dashed curves show the prediction of the mass-action equation for the same\nparameters, but constant excitonic Rydberg. As expected, the self-consistent Rydberg\nsolution gives a small correction at low density, and a larger correction at higher density.\nThe self-consistent prediction becomes the same as the constant-Rydberg prediction\nat low temperature; for the parameters used in Fig. 1 the two predictions are identical\nbelow 4 K.\nWe can also plot the ionized fraction as a function of density at fixed temperature. Figure 2 shows the fraction of ionized carriers as a function of density for various\ntemperatures predicted for bulk GaAs. At low temperature, the insulator-conductor\ntransition is quite sharp, while at higher temperature it is less so, but at all temperatures there is a \"catastrophe\" at which ne /n becomes strictly equal to unity. Below\nT = 4 K, the critical density predicted by these equations becomes greater than that\nof the phase-space filling Mott transition density, n ' 1/a3 = 3 \u00d7 1017 cm\u22123 . Surprisingly, the mass-action also predicts that at extremely low densities, the fraction of free\ncarriers approaches 100% at all temperatures. This is because the rate of formation\nof excitons is proportional to n2e , and at low density the electrons simply cannot find\neach other to form excitons.\nFigure 3 shows the predicted phase boundary. At low temperatures, this is a sharp\nconductor-insulator phase boundary.

At the ionization catastrophe, the exciton line will disappear.\n\n3\n\nCalculations for a two-dimensional System\n\nWe can use the same approach for a two-dimensional system, e.g. carriers in quantum\nwells.

A numerical solution\nfor the variation of the Rydberg as screening increases in two dimensions has been\nperformed by Portnoi and Galbraith [1], which can be approximated as\nRy =\n\n!\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n2\n\uf8f2 Ry(0) 1 \u2212\np\n, l/a > 12\nRy(l) =\n1\n+\n2l/a\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n1\n\n(17)\n\nl/a \u2264 2 ,\n\n0,\n\nwhere a is the 2D excitonic Bohr radius.\nFigure 4 shows the fraction of free carriers as a function of temperature for the\nparameters of narrow GaAs quantum wells, with Ry = 10 meV, for two densities. In\nthis case only one in-plane mass is relevant at low temperature. This figure also shows\na curve for the same parameters but Ry = 4 meV, with the same exciton Bohr radius,\nwhich are realistic parameters for indirect excitons in double quantum wells, which\nhave been used in recent experiments [13, 14]. It is perhaps surprising that excitons\nexist all the way up to 100 K or above at these densities. This is a simple consequence\nof the prediction of the mass-action equation (13), which in the limit of low density\nand high temperature is\nnex\nn \u2206\n=\n.\n(18)\nn\nnQ kB T\n\n9\n\n\fFigure 5: Fraction of free carriers in single GaAs quantum wells predicted by Equation 14\nin the text, as a function of density for the temperatures shown. Parameters for GaAs are\nthe same as for Fig. 4.\nAlthough higher temperature favors ionization, the free carrier fraction is never 100%\nunless there is an ionization catastrophe. The fraction of the gas which is excitons is\nvery low at these high temperatures, (e.g. about 1% at T = 90 K for 4 meV binding\nenergy), but since they have a strong oscillator strength they can still have a strong\nemission in the luminescence in many semiconductors.\nFigure 5 shows the fraction of free carriers as a function of total pair density for\nseveral temperatures, for the case of single quantum wells. A sharp transition occurs at\nall temperatures, above which ne /n is exactly equal to unity. The behavior is similar\nto that of bulk, but with the temperature scale shifted to higher temperature and\ndensity. Figure 6 shows the predicted phase diagram, for the two different values of\nexciton binding energy discussed above.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nThe self-consistent mass action equation presented here allows a relatively simple way\nof calculating the fraction of excitons in equilibrium in a population of excited carriers,\n\n10\n\n\fFigure 6: Predicted phase diagram of carriers in GaAs quantum wells, for two different\nexciton binding energies. (Heavy solid line: Ry = 10 meV ; dashed line: Ry = 4 meV .)\nHeavy line: the critical threshold for 100% ionization according to the model discussed in\nthe text. Above the boundary, the system is a pure plasma. Light line: the phase space\nfilling condition n = 1/a2 .\n\n11\n\n\fand also the critical density for the thermodynamic Mott transition, or ionization\ncatastrophe, in which all excitons are screened out.\nAlthough the phase boundaries for the thermodynamic Mott transition are not\nsimple, their form allows us to speak of two critical thresholds. At moderate densities\n(within an order of magnitude or so of the phase space filling density n = 1/ad , where\nd is the dimension), one can speak of a critical temperature for the Mott transition,\nsince the phase boundary corresponds to roughly constant temperature in this range.\nOn the other hand, at high temperature, one can speak of a critical density for the\nMott transition, since the phase boundary corresponds to nearly constant density in\nthis region. This critical density is typically an order of magnitude or more below the\nphase space filling density n = 1/ad in both two and three dimensions.\nAt moderate densities, the critical temperature for the Mott transition is much less\nthan Ry/kB . On the other hand, at low densities, excitons persist as a small fraction\nof the gas to temperatures well above Ry/kB .\n\nReferences\n[1] M.E. Portnoi and I. Galbraith, Phys. Rev.
