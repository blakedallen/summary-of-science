Or is it just a matter\nof convenience rather than necessity that representations constructed to date have this property? This\nquestion will be examined here by studying physical models of the axioms for number theory. Since\nthese axioms are supposed to describe natural numbers (the nonnegative integers), it follows that any\nphysical model of the axioms is a physical model of\nthe natural numbers.\nSince the (nonlogical) axioms of number theory are\nreferred to often, it is worth stating them explicitly1 .\nIn one form they are [3, 4]:\n\nThe relation between the requirement of efficient implementability and the product state representation\nof numbers is examined.

Efficient implementability (EI) means that\nthe basic arithmetic operations are physically implementable and the space-time and thermodynamic resources needed to carry out the implementations are\npolynomial in the range of numbers considered. Different models of numbers are described to show the\nindependence of both EI and the product state representation from the axioms. The relation between\nEI and the product state representation is examined.\nIt is seen that the condition of a product state representation does not imply EI.

This is the case for macro1 Arithmetic differs from number theory in that Peano's inscopic systems, such as classical computers, which are\nin such wide use. It is also true for microscopic sys- duction axiom is included.\n1\n\n\fnumbers. Any physical system with states and operators that satisfies the axioms has states that represent the numbers and operators on the states that\nrepresent the arithmetic operations. Such a system is\nreferred to as a (physical) model of the axioms. This\ndefinition is quite useful in that the axioms characterize the natural numbers in terms of properties of\nthree basic operations, the successor S, addition (+),\nand multiplication (\u00d7). These are referred to here as\nthe basic arithmetic operations.\nIn recent work [5][6], physical models of the axioms for the natural numbers, integers, and rational\nnumbers were studied. Emphasis was placed on the\nessential role that the requirement of efficient implementability of the basic arithmetic operations plays\nin any physical model of the axiom systems for the\ndifferent types of numbers. This requirement is an\nessential component of all computers and in studies\nof computational complexity [7]. This requirement is\nnot expressed by the axiom systems for the different\ntypes of numbers. However, from the viewpoint of\nthe importance of developing a comprehensive theory of mathematics and physics together [8], such a\nrequirement becomes an essential condition to be satisfied by any physical model of the axioms.\nThe condition of efficient implementability applied\nto the basic arithmetic operations means that for each\noperation there must exist physical procedures that\ncan actually be implemented and for which the implementation is efficient. Efficiency means that the\nspace-time and thermodynamic resources needed for\nimplementation must be polynomial and not exponential in the number of digits in the numbers represented [5]. An equivalent statement that avoids the\nuse of string representations is that the resources required must be polynomial in the logarithm of the\nnumbers represented and not polynomial in the numbers.\nHere the position taken follows that in [5] in that\nany physical model of natural numbers (and integers\nand rational numbers also) must satisfy both the axioms of number theory and the condition of efficient\nimplementability of the basic arithmetic operations.\nThat is, a physical system has states representing\nnumbers if and only if the states can be prepared efficiently and there exist dynamics for the basic arith-\n\nmetic operations that can be efficiently implemented\non the states. No conditions are placed on the complexity of the system. It can be macroscopic or microscopic. For microscopic systems for which decoherence effects are important [9], the requirement is\na minimal limit in that it accepts physical systems\non which the basic operations can be applied without loss of coherence. However, more complex operations requiring more resources would be affected\nsignificantly by decoherence.\nIn this paper the interest is in the relations between\nthe axioms of number theory, efficient implementability, and the product state representation of numbers.\nOf special interest is the question of whether or not efficicient implementability is a sufficient condition for\nthe states representing numbers to be product states.\nThat is, for all physical systems, does efficient implementability imply a product state representation?\nOr do there exist physical systems for which the basic\narithmetical operations are efficiently implementable\non nonproduct state representations of the numbers?\nThe wide existence of computers, macroscopic and\nmicroscopic, that are efficient and are based on the\nproduct state representation of numbers, is not of\nmuch help in deciding this question. Is this a matter\nof convenience in that there also exist nonproduct\nrepresentations for which the arithmetic operations\ncan be efficiently implemented, or can one prove that\nno such representations exist?\nThese relations are investigated by first exploring\nin more detail in the next section the relation between physical models and efficient implementability.\nEmphasis is placed on quantum mechanical systems.\nThen the description of a model is given in Section 3\nwith no assumptions made about the structure of the\nsystem states representing numbers. The model is\nbased on a description of operators for several successor operations instead of just one and on projection\noperators. Addition and multiplication are defined in\nterms of polynomially many iterations of these simpler operators.\nThis and other models are used to examine in Section 4 the relation between efficient implementability, a product state representation of numbers, and\nthe axioms of number theory. It is seen that the axioms of number theory are independent of both the\n2\n\n\f[5, 10].\nThere also exist physical models with binary product state representations of numbers in which neither\nS, + nor \u00d7 can be efficiently implemented. An example consists of a row of infinite square wells each\ncontaining one spinless particle. The product states\nrepresenting numbers describe each of the particles in\neither the ground or first excited state in the wells.\nThe wells are scaled so that the well width dj+1 for\nthe well at site j + 1 is related to that for the site\nj well by dj+1 = dj /2. Since energy level separations in in the jth well are proportional to (dj )\u22122 ,\none sees that the energy resources required to implement any of the basic arithmetic operations have an\nexponential dependence on the number n of wells in\nthe model.\nThis example shows that the requirement of efficiency can be separated from that of physical implementability, but only over a restricted range of physical parameters. For instance for n \u223c 10 \u2212 15, such\na model could probably be constructed even though\nit would not be practical. However for n \u223c 100 such\na model is impossible to construct as one could not\neven physically construct the wells to hold the particles. This follows from the scaling of the well size\nas inversely proportional to the spring constant. For\ninstance, in this case, if d1 \u223c 1 cm, then d100 \u223c 10\u221230\ncm which is of the order of the Planck length.\nOther models to consider represent numbers using entangled states. As an example, consider a system of n spin 1/2 particles contained in potential\nwells, one particle per well at positions x1 , x2 , * * * , xn .\nThese are collectively represented by a function x\nfrom 1, * * * , n to the set of n positions. A magnetic\nfield is present as a reference frame for spin alignment\nalong (\u2191) and opposite (\u2193) to the field direction. Let\n|s, xi = \u2297nj=1 |s(j), xj i denote a product state of the\nspins where s is a function from 1, * * * , n to 0, 1. Here\n1 denotes \u2191 or spin along and 0 denotes \u2193 or spin\nopposite to the magnetic field direction.\nIn the following let s be any function as defined\nabove except that s(n) = 0 and let s be obtained from\ns by exchanging ones and zeros at each location. That\nis s(j) = 1\u2212s(j). Let |si and |si be the corresponding\n\nproduct state representation and the efficient implementability requirements in that there are models of\nthe axioms in which these conditions are true and\nothers in which they are false.\nExamination of the relation between efficient implementability and the product state representation\nshows that the implication, efficient implementability implies a product state representation, is an open\nquestion, in spite of arguments suggesting that it is\nnot valid. The converse implication is proved to be\ninvalid.\n\n2\n\nPhysical Models and Efficient\nImplementability\n\nOne way to show the need for the restriction of physical models to those satisfying the efficient implementability condition is to consider physical models\nof the axioms of arithmetic that do not satisfy the\nrequirement. One model that does not use a product\nrepresentation consists of a one dimensional lattice of\nspace positions with a particle located at any one of\nthe positions. If one site is chosen to be the origin\nthen the state \u03c80 for the particle at the origin represents the number 0 and the state (US )n \u03c80 = \u03c8n represents the number n. US implements S by shifting\nthe particle to an adjoining site in a fixed direction.\nIn this model the S operation is clearly efficiently\nimplementable. However operations for + and \u00d7 are\nnot efficient since their definitions in terms of S show\nthat exponentially many iterations of S are required.\nThis model is a good illustration of the provable fact\nthat any model in which + and \u00d7 are defined in terms\nof iterations of S is not efficient.\nThese arguments also extend to any physical models useing product states for unary representations of\nnumbers. For these models implementation of + and\n\u00d7 are not efficient irrespective of whether S is or is\nnot efficient. For this reason, in what follows product\nstate representations will refer to binary representations. Extension to k\u2212ary representations with k > 2\nis straightforward, except that k cannot be too large2\n2 Basic physical considerations limit the amount of information that can be placed in or distinguished in a given space\n\ntime volume [10].\n\n3\n\n\fproduct states. It is clear that all these states are\npairwise orthogonal.\nConsider states of the form \u221a12 (|s, xi\u00b1|s, xi) These\nentangled states are also pairwise orthogonal. Numbers can be associated with these states as follows:\n\nthis requirement. The requirement means that for a\ngiven operation there must exist an efficient implementable dynamics for carrying out the operation.\nIn the case of numbers and Schr\u00f6dinger dynamics, a\nphysical system has states that represent numbers if\nand only if there exist Hamiltonians, HS , H+ , H\u00d7 for\nn\nX\n1\nefficiently implementing the successor (S), addition\nj\u22121\n\u221a (|s, xi + |s, xi) \u21d2\ntj 2\nif t = s\n(+),\nand multiplication (\u00d7) operations on suitable\n2\nj=1\ne +,\ne \u00d7\ne are the operstates\nof the system. That is if S,\nn\nX\n1\nj\u22121\nators\non\nthe\nphysical\nstate\nspace\nof\nthe\nsystem that\n\u221a (|s, xi \u2212 |s, xi) \u21d2\ntj 2\nif t = s.

They can also\nbe different for the acquisition and processing phases\nand any other relevant system parameters.\nIf the dynamics of a process require the acquisition\nand processing of n bits or qubits of information, the\ntime t required to\nR t carry out the process is given approximately by 0 R(t)dt \u223c Rt = n or t = c\u22121 nk\n(polynomial) and t = c\u22121 K n (exponential). Which\ntype applies depends on both the process dynamics\nand the state representation used.\nIf the dynamics of each of the processes for implementing the three basic arithmetic operations for\nnumbers up to 2n requires the acquisition and processing of n bits or qubits, then efficiency requires\nthat the times tS , t+ , t\u00d7 given in Eqs. 2 and 5 are\nall equal to c\u22121 nk where the constants can be different for each of the three processes. However it does\nnot follow that for all physical systems the dynamics of each of these three processes requires n bits of\ninformation.\nAn example of this is shown by the example considered earlier of the unary representation of numbers.\nIn this case the successor operation S is just a shift.\nSince implementation of the shift is independent of\nwhere it is, the information required by the dynamics is a constant independent of n. Stated otherwise\nthe operation is strictly local. The dynamics for implementing + and \u00d7 are quite different in that they\nare global. For these operations, implementation of\nthe dynamics depends on where the particle is relative to the choice of the origin, or location of the 0\nsite. Because of this the dynamics for these two operations are exponentially slow even though that for\nS is polynomial. This is why unary representations\nare rejected as physical models of number theory or\narithmetic.\nThese considerations also show that the condition\nof efficient implementation is not preserved under\n\n3\n\nMultisuccessor Models\n\nAs was noted one problem with defining + and \u00d7\nin terms of the successor operation described in the\naxioms is that exponentially many iterations are required. This leads to the question of finding relatively\nsimple operations whose properties can be easily axiomatized, and polynomially many iterations of these\noperations can be used to define + and \u00d7.\nOne approach to this problem is to consider a\nmodel based on the use of many successor operations,\nnot just one. In this model the + and \u00d7 operations\nare defined in terms of polynomially many iterations\nof the successor operations. The product representation of numbers is not assumed.\nThe multisuccessor model is motivated by the binary representation of numbers < 2n shown in the\nrighthand term of Eq. 1. Based on this representation successor operators, S1 = S, S2 , * * * , Sj , * * *, are\nintroduced for each j. These operators correspond\nto addition of 2j\u22121 just as S corresponds to the +1\noperation.\nIf desired, one may expand the axioms for arithmetic by inclusion of axioms for all the successor operators. However this will not be done here as it is\nnot necessary. Also one may wonder what has been\ngained by requiring the efficient implementability of\nall the Sj rather than applying this requirement separately to just the three operations S, +, \u00d7. One reason is that the successor operations are simpler operations than are + and \u00d7. Also in many physical\n5\n\n\fThe properties can also be used to show that there\nare 2n orthogonal subspaces in B that can be given a\ncyclic ordering by iterations of Va1 . However there is\nno association of the property parameters in A to the\nsubspaces \u03b2. Also no subspace is associated with the\nnumber 0. From now on the subspaces are assumed\nto be one dimensional, so \u03b2 can be represented as a\nstate |\u03b2i.\nOne way to achieve this is to define operators that\ncan be used to describe this association. To this end\nlet p\u01eb{\u03b1, \u03b3} denote the two values of some physical\nparameter associated with an observable that is different from that associated with the values in A. Define 2n projection operators Pa,p and n unitary operators Ua to have the following properties:\n\nmodels the Sj are related to one another by means\nof a transformation operator U that is independent\nof the index j. That is Sj+1 = U (Sj ). In these models, which are much used in practice, efficient implementability of all the successors follows from that of\nthe two operations, S and U.\nThe model considered here will be a microscopic\nmodel in which numbers are represented by orthonormal states in a Hilbert space H with arbitrary tensor\nproduct structure. For example H could have no tensor product structure or it could be a tensor product\nspace where the subspaces are described by different\ntypes of entangled states. This includes a possible description using bound entangled states as described\nby Bennett and others [11]. To keep things simple\nthe model will be given for arithmetic modulo 2n .\nLet A be a set of physical parameters for a quantum\nsystem. These could be eigenvalues for some system\nobservable. Let Va be a set of operators on the state\nspace of the system indexed by the parameters a in\na finite set A of n parameters. The operators Va are\nrequired to have the following properties [5]:\n\n7. Each Pa,p is 2n\u22121 dimensional and all the Pa,p\ncommute with one another. Also Pa,\u03b1 = e\n1\u2212 Pa,\u03b3\nfor each a.\n8. Ua Pa\u2032 ,p = Pa\u2032 ,p Ua if a 6= a\u2032 .\n9. Ua Pa,\u03b1 = Pa,\u03b3 Ua ; Ua Pa,\u03b3 = Pa,\u03b1 Ua .\n10. For each a there is exactly one p such that\nPa,p |\u03b2i = |\u03b2i.\n\n1. Each Va is a cyclic shift.\n2. The Va all commute with one another.\n\nProperties 7,10 show that to each state |\u03b2i there is associated a specific function s from the set A to {\u03b1, \u03b3}.\nThe association is given by\nY\n4.

Let am\nbe this unique a.\n\n5. For each a\u2032 , if there is an a 6= a\u2032 such that Uniqueness is provided by the next property:\n(Va )2 = Va\u2032 , then a is unique.\n11.

This is shown by both\nthe well known existence of physical models in which\nthe operations are physically implementable and the\nexample given in Section 2 of a model containing a\nrow of infinite square wells wells where the well width\ndecreased exponentially with well position. For this\nexample the operations are not efficient and are therefore not efficiently implementable.\nIt remains to address the relation between the requirement of efficient implementability and product\nstate representations of numbers. The example noted\nabove shows that the implication: product state representation of numbers implies the efficient implementability of the basic arithmetic operations is not\nvalid. The reverse implication is more difficult. In\nfact one can give arguments that suggest that efficient implementability is independent of the product\nrepresentation of numbers. That is, it neither implies\nor is implied by the product representation condition.\nIt is worth examining this in more detail. To prove\nthat efficient implementability does not imply a product state representation it is sufficient to show some\nentangled representation, such as that for Eq. 1, for\nwhich the successor operators Va defined by properties 1 \u2212 6, 12 are efficiently implementable.\nTo this end assume the entangled representation\nof numbers given by Eq. 1 with the n physical systems located as described at space sites x1 , * * * , xn .\nThen the physical procedure for implementing each\nVa would have to include coherent interactions with\nall the n physical systems. The interactions between\nthe component systems would have to extend coherently over the space region occupied by the n systems.\nIt is reasonable to expect that the degree of difficulty, or resources needed, to implement the Va\nwould increase polynomially with n. This is based\non the argument that the range over which the interactions need to be coherent increases linearly with\nn. This suggests that if the Va are efficiently implementable for physical states of the form of Eq. 1\nfor some n, they are efficiently implementable for all\nn even though the resources required for implementation might increase with a high power of n. One\nwould not expect the resources required to increase\n\nBased on this one might conclude that the properties of the Va and the projection and unitary operators given above are sufficient to prove that the states\n|\u03b2i have a product structure. This is not the case.\nTo see this consider the entangled state representation of numbers by Eq. 1 for the model described\nabove. In this model let Qs,A and Qs,A be projection\noperators for the states |s, Ai and |s, Ai respectively.\nThat is, Qs,A |s, Ai = |s, Ai and Qs,A |s, Ai = |s, Ai.\nHere, as before, s(am ) = 0 and s(a) = 1 \u2212 s(a) for\neach a\u01ebA. am is the maximum value of A according\nto property 3.\nDefine the unitary operator U by\n1\n\u221a (|s, Ai + |s, Ai) = U |s, Ai\n2\n1\n\u221a (|s, Ai \u2212 |s, Ai) = U |s, Ai.\n2\n\n(14)\n\nUnitarity\nfollows\nfrom\nthe\nfact\nthat\nhs\u2032 , A|U \u2020 U |s, Ai = \u03b4s,s\u2032 .\nBased on this one sees that Pt,A = U Qt,A U \u2020 for\nany sequence t where t = s or t = s. So Pt,A satisfies\nEq. 7 with |\u03b2i = U |t, Ai. Note that in Eq. 7 Ps \u2261\nPs,A .\nFrom this one has\nt(a)=p\n\nPa,p =\n\nX\n\nPt,A .\n\nt\n\nIf Ua and Va are defined by properties 7-12, it is\nstraightforward to show that the Va have properties\ne and \u00d7\ne in terms\n1-6. In this case the definitions of +\nof these operators apply. Proofs that these operators\nsatisfy the axioms of number theory are tedious but\nalso straight forward [5, 6].\nThis constitutes a proof that nothing in the axioms\nof number theory implies a product state representation model, even for multiple successor models based\non the projection operators and the Va with the properties described. It follows that the axioms of number\ntheory are independent of the product state representation condition in that there are models of the\naxioms in which numbers are represented by product\nstates and models in which they are represented by\nentangled states.\n8\n\n\fexponentially with n.\nThis type of inductive reasoning, combined with\nthe fact that for n = 2 the two operators Va should\nbe physically implementable, suggests that the implication is valid. Physical implementability for n = 2\nis based on the the fact that the states shown in Eq.\n1 are the four Bell states.\nThe problem with this argument is that, although\nit may be reasonable, it does not constitute a rigorous\nproof. Lacking is a discussion of the n dependence of\nthe resources required to overcome the effects of decoherence [12, 13] including the use of quantum error\ncorrection codes [14]. Also lacking is a precise definition of physical implementability of a procedure.\nWithout this it is difficult to show conclusively, in\nspite of the above argument of reasonableness, that\nefficient implementability does not imply a product\nrepresentation of numbers.\nThe above shows that the properties of numbers\nand the basic arithmetic operations cannot be used to\ndetermine if efficient implementability implies a product state representation of numbers. One must look\nelsewhere for such a proof. Another approach is based\non the fact that all physical processes and computations are specific examples of information manipulation processes. In general each such process consists\nof a sequence of alternating information acquisition\nphases, information processing phases, and possible\ninformation distribution phases. This includes computations and tasks performed by robots, microscopic\n[15] or macroscopic.\nIf the dynamics of an information manipulation\nprocess depends on or is sensitive to n bits or qubits\nof information then at least n bits or qubits of information must be acquired, and processed. Then the\n(reversible) dynamics of the process is represented by\na unitary step operator U acting on the 2n dimensional Hilbert space of states of the n qubits. Since\none is interested in the time development of the states\nof the n qubits, it makes sense to choose the product basis |bi = \u2297j=1 g n |bj ij , where |bj ij is a basis\nstate for the jth qubit, as the reference basis for the\nn qubits rather than some entangled basis.\nThis abstract representation of the dynamics of an\nn qubit information theoretic process is related to\nphysical processes through unitary maps W from the\n\nbasis states |bi to a basis of physical states of some\nphysical system that span a 2n dimensional Hilbert\nsubspace of states of the system [5]. (See also Viola et\nal [16] for a discussion regarding the relation between\nqubits and physical systems.) The dynamical process\non the states of the physical system corresponding to\nthe action of U on the qubits is represented by the\noperator W U W \u2020 .\nIt is to be noted that there is no requirement that\nthe map W take product qubit states into product\nstates of different physical degrees of freedom of the\nphysical system. The states W |bi can just as well\nbe entangled states of the physical system. Whether\nthey are entangled or product states depends on W .\nIt is also the case that the requirement of efficient\nimplementability applies to the implementation of\nthe operator W U W \u2020 as this corresponds to a physical process. The requirement does not apply to the\nmore abstract U as this is an abstract information\ntheoretic dynamics representing many different physical processes, each characterized by a different map\nW from the information theoretic qubit states to different Hilbert spaces of physical states of different\nsystems.\nThis situation makes it unlikely that anything is\nto be gained by using the more abstract information\ndynamics to prove or disprove that efficient implementability implies or does not imply a product state\nrepresentation. If one could prove the implication,\nthen this would restrict the maps W to be maps from\nproduct qubit states to product states of physical degrees of freedom.

As such they do not contradict the open question conclusion stated above. As has been noted a\nproblem in giving such a proof is the lack of an exact\n9\n\n\fcharacterization of physical implementability. Lack- [7] C. H.
