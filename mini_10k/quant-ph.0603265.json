Successful teleportation [1], entanglement [2] and memory storage [3] have been demonstrated\nmaking use of only Gaussian input states (coherent and\nsqueezed states) and Gaussian operations (homodyne detection and bilinear interactions in the canonical conjugate x and p variables of the systems). The relative\nsimplicity of the implementation and theoretical analysis of Gaussian states and operations comes at a prize\n[4, 5, 6]: distillation is provably not possible! In order\nto distil the entanglement of Gaussian states, one must\ncarry out non-Gaussian operations and, at least for a\nwhile, leave the set of Gaussian states [6]. Although distillation of quantum entanglement is not possible with\nGaussian states and operations, distillation of a quantum key for cryptography has been proposed [7]. Given\nthe current experimental interest and the relative simplicity, it is worth while to investigate how well one may\nuse Gaussian states and operations to entangle remote\ncontinuous variable quantum systems, coupled by a lossy\nquantum channel, and to address the related question\nabout how well one may teleport an unknown quantum\nstate by use of the entangled channel.\nIn theory [8] and experiment [2], entanglement between\ntwo trapped atomic gases is generated when the atoms\nare probed by off-resonant light (effective Faraday rotation interaction), and the transmitted probe light is\nmonitored by homodyne detection. In Fig. 1(b) we display the situation we are concerned with. We imagine\nthe gases to be at a large distance L from each other and\nthat there is a loss of \u01eb in the light intensity between the\n\n2\n\nEPR\nsource\n\nb)\n1\n\n2\n\nFIG. 1: Illustration of continuous variable systems sharing\nentanglement between two light pulses (panel (a)) (see, e.g.,\n[1]), and between two macroscopic atomic gases (panel (b))\n(see, e.g., [2]).

Figure 1(a) illustrates the alternative situation where the entanglement is shared between two light\nbeams propagating from an EPR source [1, 9, 10, 11].\nIn the present work we are primarily concerned with the\nsystem in panel (b), and the setup in (a) with entangled\nphotons serves as a reference.\nIt is an interesting observation, that the no-distillation\ntheorem precludes us from establishing several such entangled ensemble pairs and concentrating the entanglement into a single system, whereas during the optical\nprobing of the atomic samples, the atomic entanglement\nis indeed increasing due to the sequential transmission\nof more and more segments of the light beam, which are\nalso continuous variable quantum systems. It is accordingly not clear if the entanglement achievable in a single\npair of atomic ensembles is fundamentally limited by loss\n\n\f2\nand if so, what is its maximum value. We shall answer\nthis question by direct computation of the state resulting\nfrom various measurement schemes.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce the measure of entanglement to be used throughout\nthis work. In Sec. III, we recall the Gaussian covariance\nmatrix analysis of the continuous variable systems. In\nSec. IV we consider the atomic system (Fig. 1(b)) in the\nasymmetric case where light is sent in the direction from\ngas '1' to gas '2', only. In Sec. V we consider a symmetrized setup with light being sent in both directions.\nIn Sec. VI we quantify the degree of entanglement that\ncan be obtained in the two systems. In Sec. VII, we conclude with a discussion of the usefulness of the generated\nentanglement for teleportation with continuous quantum\nvariables.\nII.\n\nMEASURES OF ENTANGLEMENT\n\nWe are concerned with Gaussian continuous quantum\nvariables systems. A Gaussian state for a vector of variables y = (y1 , y2 , . . . , yn ) is fully characterized by its\nmean value vector m and its covariance matrix \u03b3 with\nentrance ij given by \u03b3ij = 2Reh(yi \u2212 hyi i)(yj \u2212 hyj i). The\ndegree of entanglement of a bipartite Gaussian state is\ntherefore also characterized by its covariance matrix.\nIn our calculations below we are concerned with a twomode covariance matrix which in a local (x1 , p1 , x2 , p2 )\nbasis of canonical conjugate variables reads\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nvx1 0 cx 0\n\uf8ec 0 vp1 0 cp \uf8f7\n,\n(1)\n\u03b312 = \uf8ed\ncx 0 vx2 0 \uf8f8\n0 cp 0 vp2\nwith vxj = 2Var(xj ), vpj = 2Var(pj ), and correlations\nc\u03b1 , (\u03b1 = x, p). To quantify the entanglement of such\na state, we consider the logarithmic negativity [12, 13],\nP\n\u2212 4k=1 log2 [min(1, |\u03bbk |)], which is calculated from the\nT1\nT1\neigenvalues \u03bbk of i\u03c3 \u22121 \u03b312\n, where \u03b312\nis the partial transpose of \u03b312 obtained by multiplying all entrances in \u03b312\ncoupling p1 and other observables by \u22121 (i.e., cp \u2192 \u2212cp\nin (1)), and where \u03c3jk = \u2212i[yj , yk ] is the matrix specifying the commutators between our x and p variables.\nHere and throughout, ~ = 1. For a matrix of the above\nform, we find |\u03bb1 | = |\u03bb2 | and |\u03bb3 | = |\u03bb4 | and only one,\nsay |\u03bb| of these norms may be smaller than unity and\nhence contribute to the measure of entanglement. We\nlabel this quantity N = |\u03bb|, and the logarithmic negativity is then given by \u2212 log2 (N ). The negativity N is an\nanalytical but lengthy expression of the elements of (1),\nand we will return to special cases in Sec. V.\nIn our analysis we shall also encounter the symmetric\ntwo-mode Gaussian state with covariance matrix\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nn 0 k 0\n\uf8ec 0 n 0 \u2212k \uf8f7\n.\n(2)\n\u03b312 = \uf8ed\nk 0 n 0 \uf8f8\n0 \u2212k 0 n\n\nNow, |\u03bb1 | = |\u03bb2 | = |n \u2212 k|, |\u03bb2 | = |\u03bb4 | = |n + k| and the\nnegativity N reduces to the quantity \u2206 = Var(x1 \u2212x2 ) =\nVar(p1 + p2 ) known as the EPR uncertainty [14]. We\nare interested in the case of entangled symmetric states\nwhere\nN = \u2206 = n \u2212 k,\n\n(3)\n\nand N \u2208 (0; 1].\nSince the logarithm in the evaluation of \u2212 log2 (N ) is a\nmonotonic function it is sufficient to consider the argument N (\u2206) in order to quantify the degree of entanglement for two-mode Gaussian states.\nIII.\n\nGAUSSIAN COVARIANCE FORMULATION\n\nFirst, as a reference, we study the influence of loss on\nthe entangled fields of photons leaving an EPR-source\n(Fig. 1(a)). The entanglement in these fields is maximized when the entangled photons travel equal distances L/2 so the EPR-source is placed in the center\nof the transmission lines. For this symmetric setup, the\ncovariance matrix \u03b3EPR of the two beams is given by\nEq. (2) with initial values of n and k determined by the\nsqueezing parameter |\u03c7| for a pure squeezed state, i.e.,\nn = cosh |\u03c7|, k = sinh |\u03c7|, and consequently, the initial\nEPR uncertainty is given by \u22060 = exp(\u22122|\u03c7|). In line\nwith our previous works [15, 16], we write \u22060 = 1/r,\nand refer to r as the squeezing parameter. The loss\n\u01eb\u2032 along each arm\u221achanges the\n\u221a canonical x variable according to x 7\u2192 1 \u2212 \u01eb\u2032 x + \u01eb\u2032 xnoise , where xnoise describes the loss-induced vacuum contribution.\nFor the p\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2032\nquadrature we likewise have p 7\u2192 1 \u2212 \u01eb\u2032 p + \u01eb pnoise .\nIn terms of the covariance matrix \u03b3EPR the mapping is\n\u03b3EPR 7\u2192 (1 \u2212 \u01eb\u2032 )\u03b3EPR + \u01eb\u2032 I4 , where I4 is the 4 \u00d7 4 identity\nmatrix. Therefore n 7\u2192 (1 \u2212 \u01eb\u2032 )n + \u01eb\u2032 and k 7\u2192 (1 \u2212 \u01eb\u2032 )k,\nand the EPR uncertainty, after the transmission, reads\n\u2206EPR 7\u2192 (1 \u2212 \u01eb\u2032 )\u22060 + \u01eb\u2032 . To relate to the loss \u01eb in the full\ntransmission line we assume a uniform\n\u221a loss per propagation distance and hence (1 \u2212 \u01eb\u2032 ) = 1 \u2212 \u01eb, and the final\nresult for the EPR correlation is\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(4)\n\u2206EPR = 1 + 1 \u2212 \u01eb(1/r \u2212 1) > 1 \u2212 1 \u2212 \u01eb,\nwhere the last expression is obtained in the limit of infinite squeezing r \u2192 \u221e. The smaller the \u2206EPR , the higher\nthe degree of entanglement.\nWe now turn to the case where off-resonant light\nprobes two separated atomic gases. A continuous-wave\nlight beam which is linearly polarized along the x direction is sent through samples of atoms with two degenerate Zeeman levels each described by a Pauli spin\noperator \u03c3j (j = 1, 2, . . . , Na ) [2]. As discussed in detail elsewhere [17], we describe the interaction and the\nmeasurement process in the time-domain. A continuouswave light beam is divided into segments of duration \u03c4\nand length L = c\u03c4 each of which is assumed to be short\nenough to be accurately described by a single mode of\n\n\f3\n(xv,pv)\n1\n\n2\n(x,p)\n\n(x',p')\n\nFIG. 2: A beam splitter is used to model the effect of loss\nof light intensity I \u2192 (1 \u2212 \u01eb)I through the transmission line\non the (x, p) variables of the field. The\u221a output or\u221adetector\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nmodes\n\u221a (x , p ) are\n\u221a determined by x = 1 \u2212 \u01ebx + \u01ebxv and\n\u2032\np = 1 \u2212 \u01ebp + \u01ebpv (see text).\n\nthe electromagnetic field. The interaction with the atoms\nand the feedback due to measurement is in turn described\nby a succession of interactions with the individual beam\nsegments. For coherent light and the initially polarized\nsamples, the uncertainty relations for these variables are\nminimized, implying a Gaussian state. The interaction of\nthe samples with the off-resonant light beam gives rise to\na Faraday-rotation interaction between the macroscopic\nPNa\n\u03c3j of the atoms and the\nspin operator J = 1/2 j=1\nStokes operator S of the light field.\nWith maximally polarized atomic samples along the x\nand \u2212x direction, we have the classical relations Jx,1 =\nJx = \u2212Jx,2 = Na /2 where the subscripts '1' and '2'\nrefer to the two gases. We assume a large number of\nphotons in the probe beam such that the x component\nof the Stokes vector Sx also can be treated classically.\nThis leads to the introduction of the following vector of\nquantum operators\ny = (x1 , p1 , x2 , p2 , x, p)T\nJy,1 Jz,1 \u2212Jy,2 Jz,2 Sy\nSz\n= ( \u221a , \u221a , \u221a , \u221a , \u221a , \u221a )T ,\nJx\nJx\nJx\nJx\nSx\nSx\n\n(5)\n\nand similarly for the x variables.\nThe Hamiltonian describing the system when xpolarized light propagating in the y direction is transmitted through the two gases is H = \u03ba\u03c4,1 p1 p + \u03ba\u03c4,2 p2 p\u2032 .\nWe note that the coupling strength to the second gas is\nreduced due to the loss\n\u221a of light intensity along the transmission line, \u03ba\u03c4,2 = 1 \u2212 \u01eb\u03ba\u03c4,1 . We denote \u03ba\u03c4 = \u03ba\u03c4,1 ,\nand use Eq. (7) to express the interaction Hamiltonian\nin the output modes (x\u2032 , p\u2032 , x\u2032v , p\u2032v )\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(8)\nH = \u03ba\u03c4 1 \u2212 \u01eb(p1 + p2 )p\u2032 \u2212 \u03ba\u03c4 \u01ebp1 p\u2032v .\nThe atomic p1 and p2 variables are coupled with equal\nstrength to the output mode p\u2032 , but the output vacuum\nnoise term couples exclusively to p1 .\nThe Gaussian variables\ny = (x1 , p1 , x2 , p2 , x\u2032v , p\u2032v , x\u2032 , p\u2032 )T ,\n\nwith canonical commutators for the three independent\nsets of modes. For a probe laser field propagating in the\ny direction and being linearly polarized in the x direction,\nthe Faraday rotation interaction is \u221d Jz,i Sz (i = 1, 2) and\nexplicitly in terms of the effective Gaussian variables for\na light segment of duration \u03c4 it reads\nHi = \u03ba\u03c4,i pi p,\n\nloss associated with the light traveling from one gas to\nthe other. This loss is partly in the transmission line and\npartly in the in-coupling devices connecting light to the\natomic gas. The loss is modeled by a reduction (1 \u2212 \u01eb) in\nthe intensity in the probe beam along the transmission\nline. We model this loss by a beam\n\u221a\n\u221a splitter which mixes\nthe incoming fields x = (a + a\u2020 )/ 2, p = (a \u2212 a\u2020 )/(i 2)\nwith vacuum fields xv , pv (see Fig. 2). The beam splitter leads to a mixing of the operators\u221aof the incoming\n\u221a\nand the vacuum light modes a 7\u2192 a\u2032 = 1 \u2212 \u01eba + i \u01ebav ,\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2032\na\u2020 7\u2192 a\u2020 = 1 \u2212 \u01eba\u2020 \u2212 i \u01eba\u2020v where a prime denotes\nthe operators of the modes after the passage of the beam\nsplitter. From these relations which apply to each polarization component of the light field, and from the definitions of the Stokes vector components Sx = a\u2020x ax /2,\nSy = (a\u2020+ a\u2212 \u2212 a\u2020\u2212 a+ )/(2i), Sz = (a\u2020+ a+ \u2212 a\u2020\u2212 a\u2212 )/2,\nthe relations between the input and the primed output\nmodes are easily determined. For the variables defined\nin Eq. (5), we find\n\u0013 \u0012\u221a\n\u0012\n\u221a \u0013\u0012 \u2032 \u0013\np\n1\u221a\u2212 \u01eb \u221a\u2212 \u01eb\np\n=\n,\n(7)\npv\np\u2032v\n\u01eb\n1\u2212\u01eb\n\n(6)\n\nwhere\n\u03ba\u03c4,i is the effective coupling constant \u03ba\u03c4,i \u221d\np\nNa Nph where Nph is the number of photons in each\nsegment. A polarization rotation measurement on the\noptical beam, i.e., a measurement of the x variable of the\nprobe light preserves the Gaussian character of the states\nand likewise does the bilinear Hamiltonian of Eq. (6).\nIn previous work, the effects of loss of atomic spin\npolarization and absorption of light within the atomic\nclouds were investigated [16, 18]. Here we focus on the\n\n(9)\n\ndescribe conveniently the system with transmission loss.\nThe time-evolution of the operators yi in y is described\nby Heisenberg's equations of motion, i\u2202t yi = [yi , H]. The\nevolution from t to t + \u03c4 is then determined by the equation\ny(t + \u03c4 ) = Sy(t),\n\n(10)\n\nwith S fixed by the Heisenberg equation and given in\nterms of the coupling \u03ba\u03c4 and the loss \u01eb. Per definition of\nthe covariance matrix it follows that\n\u03b3(t + \u03c4 ) = S\u03b3(t)S T .\n\n(11)\n\nSince the vacuum output components x\u2032v , p\u2032v describe loss,\nwe should discard them after the interaction, which simply amounts to removing the corresponding rows and\ncolumns from \u03b3, which then becomes a 6 \u00d7 6 matrix.\n\n\f4\nWe probe the system by measuring the Faraday rotation of the probe field, i.e., by measuring the light\nfield observable x\u2032 . The light field is correlated with\nthe atomic samples and therefore this measurement will\nchange the atomic state of the system. We denote the covariance matrix before interaction and detection of light\nby\n\u0012\n\u0013\nA C\n\u03b3=\n,\n(12)\nCT B\nwhere the 4 \u00d7 4 matrix A describes the atomic systems,\nthe 2 \u00d7 2 matrix B the output photon field, and the\n4 \u00d7 2 matrix C the correlations between the field part\nof the system that is subject to direct measurement and\nthe atomic part that only feels the measurement-induced\nback-action. An instantaneous measurement of x\u2032 transforms A as [5, 6, 17, 19]\n\u2032\n\n\u2212\n\nT\n\nA 7\u2192 A = A \u2212 C(\u03c0B\u03c0) C ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u03c0 = diag(1, 0) and where (*)\u2212 denotes the MoorePenrose pseudo-inverse. The other parts of the covariance matrix transform as B 7\u2192 I2\u00d72 , C 7\u2192 04\u00d72 since a\nnew light segment is used in every measurement.\nIn Eq. (13), the change in A is proportional to \u03ba2\u03c4 which\nis proportional to the number of photons in the segment\nof duration \u03c4 , and therefore proportional to \u03c4 . We may\nthen consider the update of the matrix A in the limit of\ninfinitesimally time steps and obtain a non-linear differential equation with coupling constant, \u03ba2 = \u03ba2\u03c4 /\u03c4 .\nIV.\n\nASYMMETRIC PROBING WITH\nSQUEEZED LIGHT\n\nRecently, we investigated the output field of an optical parametric amplifier [20] and formulated a Gaussian\ntheory in the time-domain that consistently described\nthe squeezing of the fields for probing times longer than\nthe inverse bandwidth of squeezing. In an application\nin precision magnetometry, we showed that essentially\nthe same degree of squeezing and precision could be obtained as in the ultra-broadband squeezing case where\nthe squeezing is just described by the squeezing parameter r. In the asymmetric case the two gases are subject\nto the interaction (8), and the squeezed light is described\nby a covariance matrix diag(1/r, r), which in the output\nmodes leads to T diag(1, 1, 1/r, r)T \u22121 where T describes\nthe transformation from (xv , pv , x, p) to (x\u2032v , p\u2032v , x\u2032 , p\u2032 )\n(see Eq. (7)). The atomic covariance matrix for the two\ngases is denoted by \u03b312 as in Eq. (1). We consider the\ncontinuous limit of the update formulas for \u03b312 and obtain a non-linear Ricatti differential equation (see, e.g.,\nRefs. [15, 16, 17, 20, 21]). The matrices in this equation\ndescribe squeezing of p1 + p2 , and noise introduced by\nthe vacuum mode. The time-dependent covariance matrix which solves the Ricatti equation is on the form of\nEq. (1) with\n2\n\n2\n\nvx1 = 1 + t\u03ba (r + 4\u01eb(1 \u2212 r) + 4\u01eb (r \u2212 1)),\n\n(14a)\n\ncx = t(1 \u2212 \u01eb)\u03ba2 (r + 2\u01eb(1 \u2212 r)),\n\n(14b)\n\nvp1 =\n\nt\u03ba2 r(1 \u2212 \u01eb) + (1 \u2212 r)(1 \u2212 \u01eb) + r\n,\n2t\u03ba2 r(1 \u2212 \u01eb) + (1 \u2212 r)(1 \u2212 \u01eb) + r\n\n(14c)\n\ncp = \u2212\n\nt\u03ba2 r(1 \u2212 \u01eb)\n,\n2t\u03ba2 r(1 \u2212 \u01eb) + (1 \u2212 r)(1 \u2212 \u01eb) + r\n\n(14d)\n\nvx2 = 1 + t\u03ba2 (1 \u2212 \u01eb)(1 + (1 \u2212 r)(1 \u2212 \u01eb)),\n\n(14e)\n\nt\u03ba2 (1 \u2212 \u01eb)r + (1 \u2212 r)(1 \u2212 \u01eb) + r\n.\n2t\u03ba2 (1 \u2212 \u01eb)r + (1 \u2212 r)(1 \u2212 \u01eb) + r\n\n(14f)\n\nvp2 =\n\nWe use these expressions in Sec. VI to quantify the degree of entanglement between the two gases. We shall see\nthat although some of these expressions diverge individually for large t, the logarithmic negativity approaches a\nconstant value.\nV.\n\nSYMMETRIC PROBING WITH SQUEEZED\nLIGHT\n\nWe now turn to the symmetric case where equal\namounts of noise is added to all four quadratures. The\nsymmetric setup is obtained by sending light of different\ndirections and polarizations through the two atomic samples, i.e., the gases are subject to the\n\u221a following sequence\n1 \u2212 \u01eb(p1 \u221a+ p2 )p\u20321 \u2212\nof\neffective\ninteractions\nH\n=\n\u03ba\n1\n\u03c4\n\u221a\n\u221a \u2032\n\u01ebpv1 \u03ba\u03c4 p1\u221a\n, H2 = \u03ba\u03c4 1 \u2212 \u01eb(p1\u221a+ p2 )p\u20322 \u2212 \u01ebp\u2032v2 \u03ba\u03c4 p2 ,\n\u2032\nH3\u221a= \u03ba\u03c4 1 \u2212 \u01eb(x1 \u2212 x\u221a\n\u01ebx\u2032v3 \u03ba\u03c4 x1 , and H4 =\n2 )x3 \u2212\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03ba\u03c4 1 \u2212 \u01eb(x1 \u2212 x2 )x4 + \u01ebxv4 \u03ba\u03c4 x2 , where p\u2032iv and x\u2032iv\nare different vacuum modes. Each of these Hamiltonians\nleads to a propagation matrix S via Heisenberg's equations of motion. Tracing over all other degrees of freedom than those of the two atomic gases and adding the\ndifferential equations obtained for the four Hamiltonians\nabove leads to a single Ricatti equation and if we probe\nwith equal strengths and equal squeezing parameter (but\nr \u2192 1/r when p\u2032 components are measured instead of x\u2032 ),\nthe covariance matrix is of the symmetric form (2). The\nquantity N = \u2206 = n \u2212 k quantifies the degree of entanglement, and solves the equation\n\u2202t \u2206 = a \u2212 b\u22062 ,\n\n(15)\n\nwith growth rate for the noise\na = \u03ba2 \u01eb(1 \u2212 \u01eb + r\u01eb),\n\n(16)\n\nwhile the term driving the entanglement formation is\ngiven by\nb=\n\n4\u03ba2 r(1 \u2212 \u01eb)\n.\n1 \u2212 \u01eb + r\u01eb\n\n(17)\n\n\f5\n\nIn the presence of transmission line loss and squeezed\nlight it follows that the steady-state value for the EPR\nuncertainty is\nr\n1 \u2212 \u01eb + r\u01eb\n\u01eb\n.\n(19)\n\u2206=\n2\nr(1 \u2212 \u01eb)\nSince \u2206 must be less than unity for the two gases to\nbe entangled, Eq. (19) shows that for unsqueezed probe\nlight (r = 1) it is possible to entangle the two gases only\nif \u01eb < 4/5.\nThe minimum value of \u2206 (maximal entanglement) is\n(20)\n\nand is obtained for the optimal squeezing\nropt =\n\n1\u2212\u01eb\n.\n\u01eb\n\n10\n\n0.5\nLoss, \u03b5\n\n5\n0 0\n\nsqueezing, r\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online). Negativity at asymptotic times as a\nfunction of loss, \u01eb, and squeezing parameter r \u2208 [0.1; 10] for\nthe atomic asymmetric case where the light is only sent one\nway through the two samples, and where only the x\u2032 quadrature is probed.\n\n(21)\n\nThis equation has as a consequence a property that at\nfirst sight seems surprising: for \u01eb < 1/2 the minimum\nin \u2206 occurs for squeezed light (r > 1) as expected,\nbut for \u01eb > 1/2 the minimum in \u2206 is obtained for\nantisqueezed light, r < 1. This happens because the\nsqueezed light input modes contribute to the\n\u221a undetected\noutput mode which acts as a noise term \u2212 \u01ebp\u2032v \u03ba\u03c4 p1 on\nthe first gas in Eq. (8). By Heisenberg's equation of\nmotion for x1 , we obtain from this part \u221a\nof the Hamiltonian the mapping x1 7\u2192 x\u20321 = x1 \u2212 \u01ebp\u2032v \u03ba\u03c4 which\nmeans that the added noise is determined by the variance\n\u01eb\u03ba2 Var(p\u2032v ) = 1/2\u03ba2\u01eb(1 \u2212 \u01eb + r\u01eb) which is precisely half\nthe factor entering the noise term in Eq. (16). When we\nprobe with light that is squeezed (antisqueezed) in the x\nquadrature, the p quadrature is antisqueezed (squeezed)\nand the noise term is sensitive to the noise in this antisqueezed (squeezed) component\nVI.\n\n0.5\n\n0\n1\n\nQUANTIFYING THE ENTANGLEMENT OF\nTHE CHANNEL\n\nFor the asymmetric setup with light sent only one way\nthrough the samples, Fig. 3 shows a surface plot of the\nnegativity N for long probing times as a function of \u01eb\nand r for r \u2208 [0.1; 10].

The thin full curve corresponds to the case rmin = 0.01. The long-dashed curve is for\nthe symmetric case with N = \u01eb. The crossed curve is for the\ncase of light emitted from an optical parametric oscillator (4)\nand the circles denote the asymptotic form of the full curve\nin the long-time and infinite-squeezing limit r \u226b 1, r \u226a 1,\n(22), (23).\n\ncurve shows the corresponding result for rmin = 0.01,\nand the open circles show the results obtained with infinite squeezing: For losses less than 1/3 and in the limit\nof infinite squeezing (r \u226b 1) we obtain\nN=\n\n\u01eb\n.\n2 \u2212 3\u01eb\n\n(22)\n\n\f6\nFor arbitrarily high losses, we find surprisingly that the\nnegativity approaches a constant for antisqueezed light\n(r \u226a 1)\nN = 1/3,\n\n(23)\n\nand we find that at the particular loss of \u01eb = 1/3,\nN = 1/3 for all values of the squeezing parameter, r.\nThese results mean that no matter the loss it is always\npossible (assuming that the appropriate squeezed probe\nlight source is available) to entangle the two gases to a\nhigh level.\nThe crossed curve is given by Eq. (4) for the symmetric\nEPR light source operated at a finite degree of squeezing r = rmax = 10. The long-dashed curve describes\nthe minimum value of N for the symmetric atomic case\n(maximum entanglement) N = \u2206min = \u01eb obtained by\nthe optimal squeezing of Eq. (21).\nFrom Fig. 4 we see that for small loss and finite squeezing the light-atom system leads to higher entanglement\nthan achievable with the EPR light source for the same\ndegree of squeezing. For the asymmetric atom-light case\nwe see from the full curve in Fig. 4 that the atomlight setup leads to a higher degree of entanglement than\nthe EPR light source except in a narrow range around\n\u01eb = 1/3. In particular for losses exceeding \u223c 40 %, the\nasymmetric setup presents an efficient way to generate a\nhigh and constant degree of entanglement.\n\nVII.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn summary, we have studied the effects of (light) losses\non the achievable entanglement between two locations\ncoupled by a lossy transmission line. We characterize the\nentanglement by the argument N of the logarithmic negativity \u2212 log2 (N ). The entanglement of atomic samples\nby optical probing is experimentally interesting because\nit works with classical optical sources and because the\nentangled states are stored in stationary media for potential later use. If only coherent light is available, the\nentanglement obtained with light being sent in both directions between the gases and with probing of suitable\ncombinations\nof both the x and p atomic variables yields\np\nN = \u01eb/(4 \u2212 4\u01eb), and the gases become entangled as\nlong as the losses are below 80 %. When squeezed light is\navailable, we both have the possibility to simply prepare\nand send entangled light pulses over the transmission\nchannel and we may use the squeezed light to improve\nthe atomic probing schemes. For low losses, and with\nno limits to the degree of squeezing, the mere emission\nof entangled light pulses yields the largest entanglement,\nbut if the degree of available optical squeezing is limited,\nit becomes advantageous to use probed atomic samples,\nand, quite surprisingly we showed that for large losses,\na one-way probing scheme with anti-squeezed light leads\nto a finite negativity N = 1/3 and a logarithmic negativity as large as log2 (3) for any value of the loss. When\n\nthe loss approaches unity, the required degree of antisqueezing and probing time get larger, but as shown in\nFig. 4., realistic squeezing levels suffice to give surprisingly small N for large losses.\nEntangled states have been proposed for various quantum communication tasks, and since losses set a practical limit on the distance over which these tasks can\nbe carried out, a scheme that attains high entanglement\ndespite losses is of course interesting. To investigate if\nour entanglement is useful, we present a brief analysis of\nthe achievements of the entangled gases for continuous\nvariables teleportation [9]. We have recently presented a\ngeneral analysis of fidelities for Gaussian state transformations, including teleportation [22], and for an entangled channel of the form (3), we reproduced the known\nfidelity for teleportation of an unknown coherent state\nF =\n\n1\n1\n=\n.\n1+n\u2212k\n1+\u2206\n\n(24)\n\nThis result applies to the case of symmetric probing, and\nwith optimum use of squeezed probing light (20) the fidelity gets as high as\nF opt =\n\n1\n,\n1+\u01eb\n\n(25)\n\napproaching the classical limit of Fclassical = 1/2 [23]\nwhen the whole light field is lost.\nThe entangled state obtained from the asymmetric\nprobing can also be applied in the Braunstein-Kimble\nteleportation protocol, in which case the fidelity is expressed in terms of the variances of the non-local\n\u221a vari2 and\nables of the entangled\nchannel\np\n=\n(p\n+\np\n)/\n+\n1\n2\n\u221a\nx\u2212 = (x1 \u2212 x2 )/ 2:\n1\nF = q\n.\n(12)\n(12)\n(1 + 2Var(p+ ))(1 + 2Var(x\u2212 ))\n\n(26)\n\n(12)\n\nThe theory in Sec. IV provides the values Var(p+ ) =\n(12)\n1/(2(1 + \u03b2t)), Var(x\u2212 = (1 + \u03b1t)/2 with \u03b2 = 2(1 \u2212\n2\n\u01eb)r\u03ba /(1 + r\u01eb \u2212 \u01eb) and \u03b1 = \u03ba2 \u01eb(1 + r\u01eb \u2212 \u01eb)/2, and instead\nof applying the protocol directly we suggest to locally\n(12)\nanti-squeeze the p's, and hence p+ , and squeeze the\n(12)\n(12)\n(12)\nx's, and hence x\u2212 , so that Var(p+ ) \u2192 sVar(p+ ),\n(12)\n(12)\nand Var(x\u2212 ) \u2192 Var(x\u2212 )/s. The maximum value of\nq\n(12)\n(12)\n(26) is obtained for s = Var(x\u2212 )/Var(p+ ),\nF =\n1+2\n\n1\nq\n\n1+\u03b1t\n1+\u03b2t\n\n\u2192\n\n1\np\n(t \u2192 \u221e).\n1 + 2 \u03b1/\u03b2\n\n(27)\n\nThis expression is always less than or equal to 1/(1 + \u01eb),\nthe optimum in the case of symmetric probing (25) with\nsqueezed light, and equality is obtained for probing with\nsqueezed/anti-squeezed light with a finite squeezing factor, r = (1 \u2212 \u01eb)/\u01eb, which is incidentally also the optimal\noptical squeezing in the case of symmetric probing. For\n\n\f7\nlarge \u01eb, e.g., 90%, this value of r does indeed lead to\nsignificant entanglement, cf. Fig.4, but the teleportation\nfidelity behaves \"normally\" and approaches the classical\nvalue of 1/2 when \u01eb \u2192 1. The surprisingly high entanglement does not provide a scheme for high fidelity\nteleportation!\nWe note that we have not really proven that we made\noptimum use of the entangled state by the straightforward use of the Braunstein-Kimble protocol, but we\ncan give an independent argument for why (25) must\nbe the optimum teleportation fidelity in the case of the\nasymmetric probing scheme: Imagine a modified physical setup where the transmission line and the second gas\nof our analysis is replaced by a loss less beam splitter\narrangement and M separate gases, which each receive\na fraction 1/M of the field after transmission through\nthe first gas. Any one of these gases will become entangled with the first gas as described by the above theory,\nif we identify the transmitted fraction 1 \u2212 \u01eb with 1/M .\nThe teleportation of an unknown coherent state is accomplished by performing a joint measurement on the\nincident state and the first gas, and communicating the\noutcome to the other site, where a local operation on\nthe quantum system establishes the output state. Since\nwe share the entangled state with M different sites, we\nare thus able to teleport the same state to M different\nsites, i.e., produce M approximate clones of the incoming\nstate. The fidelity for each of these clones, however, has\nbeen shown by a different argument to be limited by the\nvalue M/(2M \u2212 1) = 1/(1 + \u01eb) [24], which therefore must\nalso be the upper limit of our teleportation fidelity.\n\nIn conclusion, without violating fundamental results on\nthe achievements of distillation, purification and cloning\nof Gaussian states, we have identified a protocol, that\nleads to finite entanglement between systems which are\ncoupled by even very lossy transmission lines. If the\nprobing field is split and distributed evenly between a\nnumber of partners, our analysis identifies instead a new\nkind of \"entanglement polygamy\", where a single system\ncan share finite entanglement with an unlimited number\nof other systems. Unlike a recent proposals for multipartite Gaussian GHZ-type states [25], where the entanglement can be concentrated and used for high-fidelity\nteleportation between any pair by measurements on all\nthe other systems, our entanglement is already sizable,\nbut not correspondingly useful for teleportation. The\nlogarithmic negativity has been criticized for not always\ngiving a reliable characterization of the entanglement of\nquantum systems. In our case, however, we have observed that also the more involved Gaussian entanglement of formation [26] is finite for large losses. Rather\nthan demonstrating a weakness of specific entanglement\nmeasures, we believe that the present study is a contribution to our discovery of different varieties of useful and,\npossibly, useless entanglement.\n\n[1] A.
