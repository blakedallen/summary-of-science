We extend Lusternik\u2013Schnirelmann theory to pairs\n(f, \u03c6), where \u03c6 is a homotopy equivalence of a space X, f is a\nfunction on X which decreases along \u03c6 and (f, \u03c6) satisfies a discrete\nanalog of the Palais\u2013Smale condition. The theory is carried out in\nan equivariant setting.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe Lusternik\u2013Schnirelmann category catX A of a subset A of a topological space X is the minimal number of open and in X contractible\nsets which cover A [14, 9]. We set cat X = catX X. Lusternik and\nSchnirelmann [14] proved that for any smooth function f on a closed\nmanifold M\nX\n(a)\ncatM K \u2229 f \u22121 (d) \u2265 cat M\nd\u2208R\n\nwhere K denotes the set of critical points of f . In particular, f has at\nleast cat M critical points, and if M is connected, then\n(b)\n\nK is infinite or f has at least cat M critical levels.\n\nFor generic f , (a) can be written as\n(c)\n\ncat K \u2265 cat M.\n\nIn [18], the estimates (a) and (b) have been generalized to a class of Banach manifolds M and functions f : M \u2192 R which satisfy the Palais\u2013\nSmale condition, and more recently, versions for continuous functions\non certain metric spaces have been found (see [4]). In this paper, we\nextend (a), (b) and (c) to more general situations.\nConsider a topological space X, a continuous map \u03c6 : X \u2192 X and a\ncontinuous function f : X \u2192 R. We say that f is a Lyapunov function\nfor \u03c6 if f (\u03c6(x)) < f (x) whenever x is not a fixed point of \u03c6.\nDate: November 14, 2018.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nYU. B. RUDYAK AND F. SCHLENK\n\n1.1. Definition. Let f and \u03c6 be as above and let Y be a subspace of\nX. We say that the pair (f, \u03c6) satisfies condition (D) on Y if f is a\nLyapunov function for \u03c6 and the following holds.\nIf A is a subset of Y on which |f | is bounded but on which\nf (y) \u2212 f (\u03c6(y)) is not bounded away from zero, then there is\na fixed point of \u03c6 in the closure of A.\nObserve that if Y is compact or if f is proper then the pair (f, \u03c6) satisfies condition (D) whenever f is a Lyapunov function for \u03c6. Condition\n(D) is a discrete analog of the Palais\u2013Smale condition for C 1 functions\non Banach manifolds. In fact, we show in Proposition 9.1 that in the\ncase of a Hilbert manifold, condition (D) generalizes the Palais\u2013Smale\ncondition.\nA topological space X is called weakly locally contractible if each\npoint of X has a neighborhood which is contractible in X. Observe\nthat this property is equivalent to cat X being definite. A space X is\ncalled binormal if X \u00d7 [0, 1] (and hence X) is normal. In particular,\nevery metric space and every compact space is binormal. A space X is\ncalled an absolute neighborhood retract (ANR) if for each closed subset\nZ of a normal space Y every map \u03c1 : Z \u2192 X admits an extension\nto a neighborhood of Z. CW-complexes and topological manifolds\nare ANR's. Every binormal ANR is weakly locally contractible (see\nLemma 4.2).\nIf some category catX A is not finite, i.e., infinite or indefinite, we\nwrite catX A = \u221e. We agree that \u221e \u2265 \u221e and that \u221e \u2265 n for every\nn \u2208 Z. Given a real valued function f on a space X, we set\nf a = {x \u2208 X | f (x) \u2264 a}.\n\n1.2. Theorem. Consider a space X and a homotopy equivalence \u03c6 of\nX. Let F be the set of fixed points of \u03c6. Assume that the function\nf : X \u2192 R is bounded below and that (f, \u03c6) satisfies condition (D) on\nf b for some b \u2208 R.\n(a) We always have\nX\n\nd\u2264b\n\ncatX F \u2229 f \u22121 (d) \u2265 catX f b .\n\n(b) If X is connected and weakly locally contractible, then F \u2229 f b is\ninfinite or f (F ) \u2229 ] \u2212 \u221e, b] contains at least catX f b elements.\n(c) If X is a binormal ANR and f (F ) is discrete, then\ncat F \u2229 f b \u2265 catX f b .\n\n\fLUSTERNIK\u2013SCHNIRELMANN THEORY ON GENERAL SPACES.\n\n3\n\nIf \u03c6 is homotopic to the identity map, then these estimates also hold\nfor b = \u221e (in which case f b = X).\nOur main results generalize Theorem 1.2 in two directions. Firstly,\nwe overcome the assumption of f being bounded below: Given \u2212\u221e <\na < b < \u221e, Theorem 6.1 provides a lower bound for the number and\nthe category of the rest points of a homotopy equivalence \u03c6 in the slice\n{x \u2208 X | a < f (x) \u2264 b}, and in Theorem 7.1 we show that if \u03c6 is\nhomotopic to the identity, then the categorical estimates in Theorem\n6.1 can be replaced by various finer ones, which also hold for b = \u221e.\nSecondly, all results readily extend to equivariant situations where a\ncompact Lie group acts on X.\nFinally, we observe in Section 8 that if \u03c6 is a homeomorphism or\nthe time-1-map of a flow, then some of the previously established estimates can be improved by using different invariants of Lusternik\u2013\nSchnirelmann type.\nNotice that even if \u03c6 is homotopic to the identity, we in general do\nnot require that there exists a homotopy between the identity and \u03c6\nwhich decreases along f . Therefore, our theory should also prove useful\nin understanding the fixed point set of other than gradient-like systems\nsuch as those arising in simulated annealing.\nThe need of extending Lusternik\u2013Schnirelmann theory to spaces more\ngeneral than manifolds was demonstrated by various proofs of the\nArnold conjecture about the number of fixed points of Hamiltonian\nsymplectomorphisms [10, 11, 19]. In these proofs different variants\nof the Lusternik\u2013Schnirelmann category were considered. We thus\ndevelop an axiomatically defined version of Lusternik\u2013Schnirelmann\ntheory (Theorem 2.3) and derive Theorem 6.1 and Theorem 7.1 from\nTheorem 2.3. In [20] this axiomatic approach will be used to develop\na Lusternik\u2013Schnirelmann theory for certain symplectic and contact\nmanifolds.\nAll spaces are assumed to be Hausdorff, and all maps and functions\nare assumed to be continuous.\n2. An axiomatic version of LS-theory\n2.1. Definition (cf. [14, 5, 6]). An index function on a topological\nspace X is a function \u03bd : 2X \u00d7 2X \u2192 N \u222a {0} satisfying the following axioms:\n(monotonicity) If A \u2282 B, then \u03bd(A, Y ) \u2264 \u03bd(B, Y ) for all Y \u2282 X;\n(continuity) For every closed subset A \u2282 X there exists a neighborhood U of A such that \u03bd(A, Y ) = \u03bd(U, Y ) for all Y \u2282 X;\n\n\f4\n\nYU.

Lemma (cf. [14]). Consider a self-map \u03c6 : X \u2192 X on the space\nX. Denote the set of fixed points of \u03c6 by F . Let f : X \u2192 R be a function and let a < b be real numbers such that (f, \u03c6) satisfies condition\n(D) on f \u22121 [a, b]. Then the following assertions hold.\n(i) Suppose that f \u22121 [a, b[ \u2229 F is empty. Then, given any neighborhood\nU of f \u22121 (b) \u2229 F , there exists n \u2208 N such that \u03c6n (f b \\ U) \u2282 f a . In\nparticular, \u03bd(f b \\ U, Z) \u2264 \u03bd(f a , Z) for every (\u03c6, Z)-supervariant index\nfunction \u03bd, and hence \u03bd(f b \\ U, Z) = \u03bd(f a , Z) whenever f a \u2229 U = \u2205.\n(ii) Suppose that there is \u03b5 > 0 such that f \u22121 ]a, a + \u03b5[ \u2229 F is empty.\nThen, given any neighborhood U of f a , there exists \u03b4 > 0 such that\n\u03c6(f a+\u03b4 ) \u2282 U. In particular, for every (\u03c6, Z)-supervariant index function \u03bd, there exists \u03b4 > 0 such that \u03bd(f a+\u03b4 , Z) = \u03bd(f a , Z).\nProof. (i) Since (f, \u03c6) satisfies condition (D) on f \u22121 [a, b] and since \u03c6\nhas no fixed point on the closed set f \u22121 [a, b] \\ U, there exists \u03b41 > 0\nsuch that\nf (x) \u2212 f (\u03c6(x)) \u2265 \u03b41\n\nfor every x \u2208 f \u22121 [a, b] \\ U.\n\nIf b \u2212 \u03b41 \u2264 a, we are done. Otherwise, let \u03b42 > 0 be such that\nf (x) \u2212 f (\u03c6(x)) \u2265 \u03b42\n\nfor every x \u2208 f \u22121 [a, b \u2212 \u03b41 ].\n\nChoose n \u2208 N so large that (n \u2212 1)\u03b42 \u2265 b \u2212 \u03b41 \u2212 a. Then \u03c6n (f b \\ U) \u2282\nf a . Indeed, assume that f (\u03c6n (x)) > a for some x \u2208 f b \\ U. Then\n\u03c6k (x) \u2208 f \u22121 [a, b \u2212 \u03b41 ] for k = 1, . . . , n.

Choose n\nsuch that \u03c6n (f b \\ U) \u2282 f a . Then, by (\u03c6, Z)-supervariance and monotonicity,\n\u03bd(f b \\ U, Z) \u2264 \u03bd(\u03c6n (f b \\ U), Z) \u2264 \u03bd(f a , Z).\n\n\fLUSTERNIK\u2013SCHNIRELMANN THEORY ON GENERAL SPACES.\n\n5\n\n(ii) Fix a neighborhood U of f a and choose a sequence of real numbers\na + \u03b5 > a1 > a2 > * * * > an > * * *\n\nwhich converges to a. We claim that \u03c6(f an ) \u2282 U for some n. Arguing\nby contradiction, suppose that An = f an \\ \u03c6\u22121 (U) 6= \u2205 for all n. Then\nf (x) \u2212 f (\u03c6(x)) \u2264 an \u2212 a for all x \u2208 An , and so inf{f (x) \u2212 f (\u03c6(x)) | x \u2208\nA1 } = 0. Since A1 is closed, condition (D) implies that A1 \u2229 F 6= \u2205.\nThis contradicts f \u22121 ]a, a + \u03b5[ \u2229 F = \u2205. So, \u03c6(f an ) \u2282 U for some n. Set\n\u03b4 = an \u2212 a.\nAssume that \u03bd is a (\u03c6, Z)-supervariant index function. By continuity,\nthere exists a neighborhood U of f a such that \u03bd(f a , Z) = \u03bd(U, Z).

Let a < b be real numbers such that (f, \u03c6) satisfies\ncondition (D) on f \u22121 [a, b]. Suppose that f (F ) \u2229 ]a, b] = {d1 , . . . , dm } is\na finite set.

Denote \u03bd(A, f a ) by \u03bc(A). If \u03bc(f b ) = \u03bc(f a ), there is nothing to\nprove. So assume that \u03bc(f a ) < \u03bc(f b ).

SCHLENK\n\nProof. Inequality (2.2) follows from the definition of ck .\nWe prove (2.3). By (2.1), ck \u2264 b. Suppose first that ck < b. Since\nf (F ) \u2229 ]a, b] is finite, we find \u03b5 > 0 such that f (F ) \u2229 ]ck , ck + \u03b5[ = \u2205,\ni.e., f \u22121 ]ck , ck + \u03b5[ \u2229 F = \u2205. By Lemma 2.2 (ii) there exists \u03b4 > 0 such\nthat \u03bc(f ck +\u03b4 ) = \u03bc(f ck ). But, by monotonicity, \u03bc(f ck +\u03b4 ) \u2265 k, and so\n\u03bc(f ck ) \u2265 k. Suppose now ck = b. Then \u03bc(f ck ) = \u03bc(f b ) \u2265 k as well. \u2738\nPlugging k = \u03bc(f a ) + 1 into (2.3), we find \u03bc(f c\u03bc(f a )+1 ) \u2265 \u03bc(f a ) + 1.\nHence,\n(2.4)\n\na < c\u03bc(f a )+1 .\n\n2.5. Claim. f \u22121 (ck ) contains at least one point of F .\nProof. Suppose the contrary. In view of (2.1), (2.4) and the finiteness of\nf (F ) \u2229 ]a, b], we then find \u03b5 > 0 such that f \u22121 [ck \u2212\u03b5, ck ] does not contain\npoints of F . By Lemma 2.2 (i), there exists n such that \u03c6n (f ck ) \u2282 f ck \u2212\u03b5 .\nHence, by (\u03c6, f a )-supervariance, monotonicity and (2.2),\n\u03bc(f ck ) \u2264 \u03bc(\u03c6n (f ck )) \u2264 \u03bc(f ck \u2212\u03b5 ) < k.\nThis contradicts (2.3).\n\n\u2738\n\n2.6. Lemma (cf. [14, II, \u00a74], [7, Lemma 19.12]). If ck = ck+1 = * * * =\nck+r , then\n\u03bd(F \u2229 f \u22121 (ck )) \u2265 r + 1.\nProof. Set A = F \u2229 f \u22121 (ck ). By continuity, there is a neighborhood\nU of A with \u03bd(U) = \u03bd(A). Arguing as above we find \u03b5 > 0 such that\nf \u22121 [ck \u2212 \u03b5, ck [ \u2229 F is empty. By Lemma 2.2 (i) there exists n such that\n\u03c6n (f ck \\ U) \u2282 f ck \u2212\u03b5 . So, by (\u03c6, f a )-supervariance, monotonicity and\n(2.2), \u03bc(f ck \\ U) < k. Now, by monotonicity, subadditivity and (2.3),\n\u03bc(f ck \\ U) + \u03bd(U) =\n\u2265\n\u2265\n\u2265\n\n\u03bc(f ck+r \\ U) + \u03bd(U)\n\u03bc(f ck+r \\ U) + \u03bd(f ck+r \u2229 U)\n\u03bc(f ck+r )\nk + r,\n\nand so \u03bd(U) > r. Thus, \u03bd(A) \u2265 r + 1.\nWe continue the proof of the theorem. We have\nc\u03bc(f a )+1 = * * * = ci1 < ci1 +1 = * * * = ci2\n< * * * < cin +1 = * * * = cin+1 = c\u03bc(f b ) .\n\n\u2738\n\n\fLUSTERNIK\u2013SCHNIRELMANN THEORY ON GENERAL SPACES.\n\n7\n\nSet Fk = F \u2229 f \u22121 (cik ) and i0 = \u03bc(f a ).

Relative equivariant category\nLet G be a compact Lie group. A G-space is a space X together with\na continuous action G \u00d7 X \u2192 X, (g, x) 7\u2192 gx. A subspace of a Gspace X is a G-invariant subspace. If X1 and X2 are G-spaces, then\na G-map \u03c6 : X1 \u2192 X2 is an equivariant map, i.e., \u03c6(gx) = g\u03c6(x) for\nall g \u2208 G and x \u2208 X1 , and a G-homotopy Ht : X1 \u2192 X2 is a map\nH : X1 \u00d7 I \u2192 X2 such that Ht : X1 \u2192 X2 is a G-map for each t.\nLet W , Y be subspaces of a G-space X.

If in addition Ht (W \u2229\nY ) \u2282 Y for all t, we say that W is G-deformable to Y mod Y .\nFix a class G of homogeneous G-spaces,\n\nG \u2282 {G/H | H \u2282 G is a closed subgroup}.\n\nA subspace A of a G-space X is called G-categorical if there exist Gmaps \u03b1 : A \u2192 G/H and \u03b2 : G/H \u2192 X with G/H \u2208 G such that the\ninclusion A \u0592\u2192 X is G-homotopic to the composition \u03b2\u03b1.\n3.1. Definition (cf. [8, 6]). Fix a subspace Y of the G-space X. If A\nis another subspace of X, we set G-catX (A, Y ) = k if A can be covered\nby k + 1 open subspaces A0 , A1 , . . . , Ak of X such that\n(i)\nA0 is G-deformable to Y\n(ii)\nA1 , . . . , Ak are G-categorical\nand if k is minimal with this property. If there is no such number k,\nwe set G-catX (A, Y ) = \u221e.\nThe invariant G-catX (A mod Y ) is defined by replacing (i) by\n(i mod) A0 is G-deformable to Y mod Y , and A0 \u2283 A \u2229 Y .\nWe set G-catX A = G-catX (A, \u2205) and G-cat X = G-catX X.\n\n3.2. Remarks. 1. If G acts trivially on X and G contains the point\nG/G, then A is G-categorical iff it is contractible in X. Therefore, in\n\n\f8\n\nYU. B. RUDYAK AND F.

If G has a fixed\npoint x and G does not contain G/G, then G-catX A = \u221e whenever\nx \u2208 A.\n3. If G acts freely on X and G is the full class of homogeneous Gspaces, then G-catX A = catX/G A/G. In general, however, G-catX A \u2265\ncatX/G A/G. E.g., if Z2 acts on S 1 = {z \u2208 C | |z| = 1} by complex\nconjugation, then G-cat S 1 \u2265 2 > 1 = cat S 1 /Z2 .\n4.

Some general topology\nIf A is a subspace of the G-space X, we set G-catX A = k if A can be\ncovered by k closed categorical subspaces A1 , . . . , Ak of X and if k is\nminimal with this property. If there is no such k, we set G-catX A = \u221e.\nWe also set G-catX = G-catX X, and, if G acts trivially and G contains\nG/G, catX A = G-catX A.\n4.1. Lemma. Let A be a closed subspace of a normal G-space X.\nThen\nG-catX A \u2265 G-catX A.\nProof. We may assume that G-catX A is finite. Let A \u2282 U1 \u222a * * * \u222a Uk\nwhere each Ui is open and G-categorical. Then {X \\ A, U1 , . . . , Uk }\nis an open covering of X.

Hence, A \u2282 V1 \u222a * * * \u222a Vk . By Proposition 1.1.1\nof [16], every set GVi = {gv | g \u2208 G, v \u2208 Vi } is closed. The inclusions\nVi \u2282 GVi \u2282 GUi \u2282 Ui imply that A \u2282 \u222aGVi and that each GVi is a\nclosed G-categorical subspace. Thus, G-catX A \u2264 k.\n\u2737\nA G-space X is called a G-ANR if for each closed subspace Z of\na normal G-space Y every G-map \u03c1 : Z \u2192 X admits an equivariant\n\n\fLUSTERNIK\u2013SCHNIRELMANN THEORY ON GENERAL SPACES.\n\n9\n\nextension to a G-invariant neighborhood of Z. Notice that G/H is a\nG-ANR for every closed subgroup H of G [16, Corollary 1.6.7].\n4.2. Lemma. Let A be a closed G-categorical subset of a binormal\nG-ANR X. Then A is contained in an open G-categorical subset of X.\nProof (cf. [12, IV, Proposition 3.4] and [5, Appendix B]). Consider\n\u03b1 : A \u2192 G/H and \u03b2 : G/H \u2192 X as in Definition 3.1 and let H : A \u00d7\nI \u2192 X be a G-homotopy between i : A \u0592\u2192 X and \u03b2\u03b1. Since G/H\nis a G-ANR, there exists a G-map \u03b3 : W \u2192 G/H where W is a Gneighborhood of A and \u03b3|A = \u03b1. Since X is normal, we find a Gneighborhood V of A with V \u2282 W . We convert X \u00d7 I to a G-space by\nsetting g(x, t) = (g(x), t). Set\nP = X \u00d7 {0} \u222a A \u00d7 I \u222a V \u00d7 {1} \u2282 X \u00d7 I\n\nand define \u03c6 : P \u2192 X by\n\n\u03c6(x, 0) = x for x \u2208 X,\n\u03c6(a, t) = H(a, t) for (a, t) \u2208 A \u00d7 I,\n\u03c6(v, 1) = \u03b2(\u03b3(v)) for v \u2208 V .\n\nThen \u03c6 is well-defined and equivariant, and since X \u00d7 {0}, A \u00d7 I and\nV \u00d7 {1} are closed subsets of X \u00d7 I, \u03c6 is continuous. Since X is a\nG-ANR and P is a closed subspace of the normal G-space X \u00d7 I, there\nexists a G-neighborhood Q of P in X \u00d7 I and an equivariant extension\n\u03c8 : Q \u2192 X of \u03c6. For each a \u2208 A the set {a}\u00d7I is compact, S\nand so there\nis a G-neighborhood Ua of a with Ua \u00d7 I \u2282 Q. Set U = a Ua \u2229 W .\nClearly, U is a G-neighborhood of A with U \u2282 W and U \u00d7 I \u2282 Q.\nNow, \u03c8|U \u00d7I : U \u00d7 I \u2192 X yields a G-homotopy between the inclusion\nU \u0592\u2192 X and \u03b2\u03b3|U .\n\u2737\n4.3. Proposition. If A is a closed subspace of a binormal G-ANR X,\nthen\nG-cat A \u2265 G-catA \u2265 G-catX A = G-catX A.\nProof.

Proposition 4.3 implies that for a binormal GANR, Theorem 6.1 holds with G-cat replaced by G-cat.\n2. We discuss the assumptions in Theorem 6.1.\n(i) The condition that \u03c6 is a G-homotopy equivalence cannot be\nomitted: If X = S 1 = {x2 +P\ny 2 = 1}, \u03c6(X) = (0, \u22121) and f (x, y) = y\nis the height function, then d \u2208 R catX Fd = 1 < 2 = cat X.\n(ii) The condition that b is finite cannot be omitted: Define X to be\nthe telescope (homotopy direct limit) of the sequence\nd\n\nd\n\nd\n\nd\n\n* * * \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 S 1 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 S 1 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 S 1 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 * * * , deg d = 2.\nIn greater detail, X is the quotient space of the disjoint union\n\u221e\na\nS 1 \u00d7 [k, k + 1]\nY =\nk=\u2212\u221e\n\nunder the following equivalence relation: (z, k) \u2208 S 1 \u00d7 [k \u2212 1, k] is\nequivalent to (z 2 , k) \u2208 S 1 \u00d7 [k, k + 1].\nWe denote by [z, k] \u2208 X the image of (z, k) \u2208 S 1 \u00d7 [k \u2212 1, k] and by\n[z, t] \u2208 X the image of (z, t) \u2208 Y for t \u2208\n/ Z. Consider the map\n\u03c6 : X \u2192 X,\n\n\u03c6[z, t] = [z, t \u2212 1]\n\nand the function f : X \u2192 R, f [z, t] = t. Then (f, \u03c6) clearly satisfies\ncondition (D), and it is easy to see that \u03c6 is a homotopy equivalence.\n(This can be seen directly or by observing that X is the Eilenberg\u2013\nMac Lane space K(Z[1/2], 1) and that \u03c6 induces an isomorphism of\nfundamental groups.) Furthermore, F = \u2205.\nNotice that f 0 is homotopy equivalent to S 1 , and so catX f 0 = 2. On\nthe other hand, cat X > 2; indeed, \u03c01 (X) = Z[1/2] is not a free group,\nand it is well known that the fundamental groupPof a space whose\ncategory is at most 2 is free [9].

LS theory for maps homotopic to the identity\nIn this section we show that for maps homotopic to the identity, the\nestimates in Theorem 6.1 can often be strengthened, and that all estimates also hold for b = \u221e.\n7.1. Theorem. Consider a G-space X and a class G of homogeneous\nG-spaces. Let \u03c6 : X \u2192 X be a G-map which is G-homotopic to the\nidentity, and let F be the set of fixed points of \u03c6. Let \u2212\u221e < a < b \u2264 \u221e,\nand let f : X \u2192 R be a G-function such that (f, \u03c6) satisfies condition\n(D) on f \u22121 [a, b]. Set Fd = F \u2229 f \u22121 (d).\n(I) If G-catX f a is finite, then the statements (a), (b), (c) in Theorem\n6.1 also hold for b = \u221e.\n(II) In case that a \u2208 f (F ) and a is an isolated point in f (F ) \u2229 [a, b[,\nassume that a G-neighborhood of f a is G-deformable to f a .

We may again assume that f (F ) \u2229 ]a, b] = {d1 , . . . , dm }.\n\n7.2. Claim. For any c > dm the space X is G-deformable to f c .\nProof. Choose a G-homotopy \u03a6 : X \u00d7 [0, 1] \u2192 X between the identity\nand \u03c6. For x \u2208 X and t \u2265 0 set\ne t) = \u03c6[t] (\u03a6(x, t \u2212 [t]))\n\u03a6(x,\n\nwhere [t] = max{n \u2208 N \u222a {0} | n \u2264 t}.

Choose a non-decreasing continuous function u : R \u2192\n[0, \u221e[ such that u(k) = nk+1 for all k \u2208 Z. Thus,\n(7.1)\n\n\u03c6[u(r)] (f r ) \u2282 f c\n\nfor every r \u2208 R.

Then \u03a8 is\nand define \u03a8 : X \u00d7 [0, 1] \u2192 X by \u03a8(x, t) = \u03a6(x,\ne u(h(x))). We verify that\na G-homotopy between the identity and \u03a6(x,\ne u(h(x))) \u2208 f c for each x \u2208 X: Set y = \u03a6(x, u(h(x)) \u2212 [u(h(x))]).\n\u03a6(x,\ne u(h(x))) = \u03c6[u(h(x))] (y) \u2208 f c .\nThen y \u2208 f h(x) . Therefore, by (7.1), \u03a6(x,\n\u2738\nc\na\nClaim 7.2 implies that G-cat X = G-catX f and G-catX (X, f ) =\nG-catX (f c , f a ). Moreover, if the homotopy \u03a8 above is constructed\nfrom a G-homotopy \u03a6t with \u03a6t (f a ) \u2282 f a , then \u03a8(f a , t) \u2282 f a for all t,\nand so X is G-deformable to f c mod f a , whence G-catX (X mod f a ) =\nG-catX (f c mod f a ). We may therefore assume that b is finite, and so,\nby the proof of Theorem 6.1, we are left with showing (a) in (II) and\n(III) for b finite.\n(II)(a) If a \u2208 f (F ), a G-neighborhood of f a is G-deformable to\na\nf by assumption, and if a \u2208\n/ f (F ), we conclude this by applying\nLemma 2.2 (i) to some b \u2208 ]a, d1 [ and to U = \u2205. So, G-catX (f a , f a ) = 0.\nIf G-catX (f b , f a ) is finite, we set\n\b\n\u03bd(A, Y ) = min G-catX (GA, GY ), G-catX (f b , f a )\nP\nand conclude from Lemma 5.2 (ii) and Theorem 2.3 that m\ni=1 G-catX Fdi \u2265\nb\na\nb\na\nG-catX (f , f ).

Remarks. 1. Theorem 7.1 shows that if \u03c6 is G-homotopic to\nthe identity, then Corollary 6.2 can be refined and extended to the\ncase b = \u221e.\n2. (a) and (c) of Theorem 6.1 and Theorem 7.1 (I) imply (a) and (c)\nof Theorem 1.2; and since a connected and weakly locally contractible\nspace is path-connected, Theorem 1.2 (b) follows from Theorem 1.2 (a).\n3. For a compact metric space X, Theorem 1.2 (a) with catX replaced by catX and \u03c6 homotopic to the identity was stated by Ma\u00f1\u00e9\n[15, Chapter II, Theorem 4.1].\nProposition 4.3 implies that for a binormal G-ANR, Theorem 7.1 (I)\nholds with G-cat replaced by G-cat.\n4. We discuss the assumptions in Theorem 7.1.\n(i) Even if b is finite, (II) in general does not hold for homotopy\nequivalences: Let S(k) be the unit circle in R2 centred at (0, 2k) and\n\n\f16\n\nYU.

Moreover, it is easy to see that if\nB(M) = cat M, then cat(M \\ {x}) = cat M \u2212 1 for every x \u2208 M [22,\np. 29]. On the other hand, there is an example of a closed manifold\nQ with cat(Q \\ {x}) = cat Q, [13]. In particular, B(Q) > cat Q. It\nis, however, still unknown whether there are closed manifolds M with\nCrit M > B(M).\n9. The Palais\u2013Smale condition (C) and condition (D)\nConsider a connected and complete Riemannian manifold M without\nboundary modelled on a separable Hilbert space.

We say that a map is C r,1 , r \u2265 0, if all its derivatives up to\norder r exist and are locally Lipschitz continuous. We assume that M\nis of class C 1,1 and that the Riemannian metric is C 0,1 . Let f : M \u2192 R\nbe a C 1,1 function and let Df (m) be its derivative at m.

A point m \u2208 M is called a\ncritical point of f if \u2207f (m) vanishes. The function f is said to satisfy\nthe Palais\u2013Smale condition (C) if the following holds:\nIf A is a subset of M on which |f | is bounded but on which\nk\u2207f k is not bounded away from zero, then there is a critical\npoint of f in the closure of A.\nChoose a smooth, monotone function g : R \u2192 R such that\ng(x) = 1 for x \u2264 1,\n\ng(x) \u2264 x for 1 \u2264 x \u2264 2,\n\ng(x) = x for x \u2265 2\n\nand set h(m) = 1/g(k\u2207f (m)k), m \u2208 M. Then V = \u2212h \u2207f is C 0,1\nand bounded, and so, M being complete, V integrates to a flow {\u03c6t },\nt \u2208 R, on M.\n9.1. Proposition. Let M, f and \u03c6\u03c4 , \u03c4 > 0, be as above. If f satisfies\nthe Palais\u2013Smale condition (C), then the pair (f, \u03c6\u03c4 ) satisfies condition\n(D).\nProof. Clearly, f is a Lyapunov function for \u03c6\u03c4 .

B. RUDYAK AND F. SCHLENK\n\nA metric G-space X is called a metric G-ANR if for each closed\nG-subspace Z of a metric G-space Y every G-map \u03c1 : Z \u2192 X admits\nan equivariant extension to a G-neighborhood of Z.\n9.2. Corollary. Let M be a Riemannian Hilbert manifold as above.\nSuppose that M is a G-space and that the Riemannian metric on M\nis G-invariant. Let K be the set of critical points of a C 1,1 G-function\nf : M \u2192 R which satisfies condition (C) on M and is bounded below.\n(a) We always have\nX\nd\u2208R\n\nG-catM K \u2229 f \u22121 (d) \u2265 G-cat M.\n\n(b) If M is a metric G-ANR and G contains all orbit types in K, then\nf has at least G-cat M critical orbits.\n(c) If M is a metric G-ANR and f (K) is discrete, then\nG-cat K \u2265 G-cat M.\nProof. Going once more through Section 4, we see that Proposition 4.3\nholds for metric G-ANR's X. Therefore, Corollary 7.5 holds for metric\nG-ANR's. Since the Riemannian metric on M is G-invariant, \u2207f and\nV are G-equivariant, and so is \u03c6t , t \u2208 R. Moreover, the critical points\nof f are the rest points of \u03c61 . The corollary now follows in view of\nProposition 9.1.\n\u2737\nLocalizing Proposition 9.1 and applying the relative version of Corollary 7.5, we obtain a relative version of the above corollary.\n9.3. Remarks. 1. Let M be as in the basic assumptions of Corollary\n9.2. Since M is metrizable, it is paracompact. Appendix B of [6] thus\nprovides sufficient conditions for M being a metric G-ANR. They are,\ne.g., fulfilled if G acts trivially, or if M and the action G \u00d7 M \u2192 M\nare C 2,1 .\n2. By the above remark, Corollary 9.2 (b) recovers the basic Lusternik\u2013\nSchnirelmann theorem for Hilbert manifolds first obtained in [21].\n3. Versions of (a) and (b) in Corollary 9.2 have been proved for\nC 1,1 functions on complete C 1,1 Finsler manifolds ([18, Theorems 7.1\nand 7.2] and [6, \u00a7 3]) and for continuous functions on weakly locally\ncontractible complete metric spaces (see [4]). We notice that in these\nsituations also the analogs of (c) hold.\n\n\fLUSTERNIK\u2013SCHNIRELMANN THEORY ON GENERAL SPACES.\n\n23\n\nReferences\n[1] A. V. Arkhangel'ski\u0131\u0306, V. V. Fedorchuk.
