INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY\nRecently de Bernardis et al.[1] reported that a very careful examination\nof the cosmic microwave background provides, as further explained by\nHu[2], very strong evidence that the universe is flat!\nIn addition, data has recently been reported by Riess et al.[3], and\nPerlmutter et al.[4] on measurements of the luminosity and the redshift\nof a number of high-redshift supernovae of type Ia. The authors' best\nfit to their data involves a strongly curved space-time. The curvature\nconstant \u03a9k (defined below) that they find is about -1.05, which corresponds to a strongly curved, open universe. However, their error bars\nare sufficiently large so that a flat universe is not inconsistent with their\ndata. These authors have analyzed their data on the basis of the \"cosmological equation\" between the rate of expansion, the mean energy\ndensity, the radius of curvature of space, and the cosmological constant. This relation has been derived from Einstein's field equations[5]\nunder the assumption of the validity of the Friedmann-Lema\u0131\u0302tre line\nWork supported in part by the US Department of Energy (contract W-7405ENG-36)\n\u2217\n\neffects2r.tex; 7/05/2019; 8:55; p.1\n\n\f2\n\nGeorge A. Baker, Jr.\n\nelement at large distances. The authors have concluded, in terms of this\nmodel of the universe, that instead of the rate of expansion decreasing,\nas many workers had thought, their data is best fit by a model in\nwhich the rate of expansion is increasing. Riess et al.[3] find that the\ndeceleration/acceleration parameter (as defined in section VI) q0 < 0\n(acceleration) with better than 90% confidence, and Perlmutter et al.[4]\nfind the same at the 2.86 standard deviation level of confidence.\nIn this paper, I investigate some different metrics which may facilitate the investigation of some of the consequences of the reported\nacceleration of the expansion of the universe. I will focus on spherically\nsymmetric models with a central mass concentration.\nThe fact that the rate of expansion of the universe is increasing\nleads to the conclusion that the universe is broken up into domains of\nattraction. Briefly, the underlying physics of this feature may be seen in\nthe following rough analysis. The equation of purely radial motion of a\ntest particle at rest with respect to the Friedmann-Lema\u0131\u0302tre coordinate\nsystem is just\n\u00e4\n(1)\nr\u0308 = r,\na\nwhere r is the proper distance, and a is the universal expansion factor\nwhich is a function of time alone. The most simple way to approximate\nthe effects of a gravitating mass concentration is just to add Newton's\nforce term so that\nGM\n\u00e4\n(2)\nr\u0308 = r \u2212 2 .\na\nr\nIf the expansion of the universe is decelerating, then \u00e4 < 0, so r\u0308 < 0\nalways. Near a gravitating mass the expansion is clearly unimportant\nand Newton's laws hold with only minimal corrections. On the other\nhand, if the expansion is accelerating, then \u00e4 > 0. Thus there will be\na distance such that the expansion of the universe exactly balances\nthe gravitational attraction. Test particles at smaller distances will be\naccelerated inwards. I call this region a domain of attraction. Test particles outside will be accelerated outwards. Hence in this very simple case\nthere are two attractors, one is the mass concentration and the other is\nthe point at infinity. We give a domain-size\u2013mass relation in equations\n(73) and (76). In the decelerating case, there is just one attractor and\nits domain of attraction is the entire space.\nIn the second section we remind the reader of the Lema\u0131\u0302tre-Tolman\nformalism. This formalism has the feature that the proper time appears\nexplicitly. Thus space-time is divided into a set of three-dimensional,\nspace-like manifolds which are indexed by the proper time. Since it is\nthe proper time which appears in the universal expansion function in\nthe Friedmann-Lema\u0131\u0302tre line element and it governs the universe as a\n\neffects2r.tex; 7/05/2019; 8:55; p.2\n\n\fACCELERATING EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE\n\n3\n\nwhole, it seems important to preserve the property that the universal\nexpansion factor is a function of the proper time alone.\nIn the third section we review three different ways to go from the\nSchwarzschild metric of a planetary system to expanding space at large\ndistances. The McVittie solution has a problem at the Schwarzschild radius using normal expansion factors. The Einstein-Straus \"Swiss Cheese\nModel\" is unstable to perturbations and there are orbits which are discontinuous functions of their initial conditions. The Bona-Stela model\nusing Liebovitz metric insertions in a Friedmann-Lema\u0131\u0302tre background\npredicts an increase in the length of the earth's year which is in strong\ndisagreement with observations.\nIn the fourth section we consider the idea that the vacuum is something more than just empty space. The self-energy of the vacuum\nmay correspond to a mass-energy density of empty space. We know\non the laboratory scale from, for example, the Casimir effect, and\non the microscopic scale from particle physics that the vacuum does\nhave measurable effects. So far as I know, particle theorists have not\nyet been able to compute a quantitative result for the energy density.\nHowever, they do feel that such an idea is extremely plausible. We\nconsider in this section a solution to Einstein's field equations which\nhas a homogeneous vacuum, mass-energy density and so preserves the\nso called \"cosmological equation.\" This solution reduces precisely to\nthe exterior Schwarzschild solution near the central mass condensation. In addition, it reduces to the Friedmann-Lema\u0131\u0302tre solution far\nfrom the mass concentration. This solution is continuously, infinitely\ndifferentiable everywhere, except at the mass concentration.\nIn the fifth section, I explore some of the properties of the solution\nobtained in the fourth section. Both \"flat\" and curved space are considered. The limiting results are as expected and the transition between\nthe two aforementioned limits are illustrated. In particular the static,\ncurved-space extension of the Lema\u0131\u0302tre-Schwarzschild solution is given\nfor a mass concentration in a vacuum.\nIn the sixth section, I consider the implications of the increasing\nrate of expansion of the universe on some of the large scale structures\nfound in the universe. It is found that this feature creates domains\nof attraction. A domain-size\u2013mass relation is derived. Outside these\ndomains, the increasing rate of the expansion of the universe would,\nin time, be expected to tear the structures apart. It is suggested, from\nthe correspondence between the predicted size of these domains of attraction, the size of the Local Group, and the size of the Virgo Cluster,\nthat this effect may well be important in any study of the large scale\nstructure of the universe.\n\neffects2r.tex; 7/05/2019; 8:55; p.3\n\n\f4\n\nGeorge A. Baker, Jr.\n\n2. THE LEMA\u00ceTRE-TOLMAN FORMALISM\nI will find it convenient to employ the Lema\u0131\u0302tre-Tolman[6, 7] formalism.\nIn this case we start with the line element,\nds2 = \u2212e2\u03b1(\u03c1,\u03c4 ) d\u03c12 \u2212 e2\u03b2(\u03c1,\u03c4 ) (d\u03b8 2 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 ) + c2 d\u03c4 2 ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere c is the velocity of light, and \u03c4 is the proper time for an observer at rest in this coordinate system. This line element is spherically\nsymmetric in its structure, which is of sufficient generality for my\npurposes.\nThe reason for our interest in this particular form of the line element is that two important line elements are special cases. First, the\nFriedmann-Lema\u0131\u0302tre line element,\n\u0001\nds2 = \u2212a2 (\u03c4 )d\u03c12 \u2212 a2 (\u03c4 )\u03c12 d\u03b8 2 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 + c2 d\u03c4 2\n(4)\n\nis manifestly of form (3). The second important line element is the\nstatic Schwarzschild line element. It is usually written in the form,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0001\n2GM\ndr 2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u2212 r d\u03b8 + sin \u03b8 d\u03c6 + c 1 \u2212 2\ndt2 (5)\nds = \u2212\n2GM\nc r\n1\u2212 2\nc r\n\nHowever, as is well known[8] this form does not extend inside the\nSchwarzschild radius rS = 2GM/c2 . An alternate form has been given\nby Lema\u0131\u0302tre [9]. It is\n\u0001\n2GM\nds2 = \u2212 2 d\u03c12 \u2212 R2 d\u03b8 2 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 + c2 d\u03c4 2 ,\nc R\ni2/3\nh p\n.\nR \u2261 32 2GM/c2 (\u03c1 \u2212 c\u03c4 )\n\n(6)\n\nThis form, without going into the full generality of the Schwarzschild\nsolution, has no singularity at the Schwarzschild radius. It is a coordinate system adapted to a freely falling observer. This metric can\neasily be seen to have the form (3). As it is our goal to find a metric\nwhich tends asymptotically to the Friedmann-Lema\u0131\u0302tre metric at very\nlarge distances, and tends asymptotically to the Schwarzschild metric\non the scale of our planetary system, it seems appropriate to use the\nLema\u0131\u0302tre-Tolman formalism. In this formalism, four dimensional spacetime is described by a set of three-dimensional, space-like hypersurfaces,\nindexed by the time like variable \u03c4 .\nNext we consider the stress-energy tensor for the line element (3).\nFirst,\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(7)\n8\u03c0cT14 = \u22122 \u03b2 \u2032 \u03b2\u0307 \u2212 \u03b1\u0307\u03b2 \u2032 + \u03b2\u0307 \u2032 = 0,\n\neffects2r.tex; 7/05/2019; 8:55; p.4\n\n\fACCELERATING EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE\n\n5\n\nwhere an overdot means differentiation with respect to \u03c4 and \u2032 means\ndifferentiation with respect to \u03c1.

CLASSICAL MODELS\nCurrently there are two general relativistic descriptions of spacetime in\npopular use. For planetary systems and other gravitationally bound\nstructures which are small on the scale of the universe, there is a\nstatic description of the behavior of spacetime. On the other hand,\nfor large-scale behavior, there is a time dependent description which\nis appropriate as a description of phenomena such as the observed\nred-shift of distant galaxies.\nThe classic question is, \"How can these two disparate descriptions of\nspacetime possibly be reconciled with each other?\" The first answer to\nthis problem was given by McVittie[11].

Thus in McVittie's model, the effects on\nthe solar system are too small to be currently measured. For systems\nlike the solar system, the McVittie model works very well. However for\nother systems, if we make the popular assumption that a(t) \u221d t\u03b3 then,\nas in McVittie's solution a(t) is a function of coordinate time and not of\nproper time, there will be a singularity at the the Schwarzschild radius\nas a(t) will diverge there since t \u2192 \u221e.\nA second answer to our question was given by Einstein and Straus\n[12]. It is the so called \"Swiss Cheese Model.\" They showed that the\nstatic Schwarzschild metric (5) can be matched to any FriedmannLema\u0131\u0302tre-Robertson-Walker metric on a spherical surface of an expanding radius in the Schwarzschild metric, but of a constant radius in\nthe Friedmann-Lema\u0131\u0302tre-Robertson-Walker metric. It has been found\nhowever[13, 14] to be unstable with respect to perturbations. In addition, there is another unphysical aspect of this model. The slowspeed dynamical equations in the interior Schwarzschild (~ri ) and in the\nexterior Friedmann-Lema\u0131\u0302tre (~re ) regions are, respectively,\nGM\nd2~ri\n= \u2212 3 ~ri ,\n2\ndt\nri\n\n\u00e4\nd2~re\n= ~re .\n2\ndt\na\n\n(35)\n\nFor ease of exposition, we choose a(t) = (t/t0 )2/3 . Thus the general\n~ \u03b3 + Bt\n~ 1\u2212\u03b3 = At\n~ 2/3 + Bt\n~ 1/3 ,\nsolution in the exterior region is ~re = At\nwhich is the equation of a parabola.\n\neffects2r.tex; 7/05/2019; 8:55; p.9\n\n\f10\n\nGeorge A. Baker, Jr.\n\nAs an illustration of the behavior of the \"Swiss cheese model\" I have\ncomputed the following trajectories. I use as a unit\nof time the Hubble\np\n3\ntime, that is 1/H0 . As a unit of distance I use M\u2299 G/H02 which is\n\u22122/3\nabout 25h50 million Astronomical units. M\u2299 is the mass of the Sun.\nI set t0 = 1. The metric interface is at r = t2/3 in these units for\nflat spacetime, as mentioned above. In order to follow a FriedmannLema\u0131\u0302tre trajectory the test particle's distance from the origin must be\nlarger at every time than that for the interface. Let us take in rectangular coordinates the initial conditions, x = \u03bb, \u1e8b = 0, y = 0, \u1e8f = \u03bb.\nThe trajectory in the external region is\n\" \u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u00131/3 #\nt\nt 2/3\n+2\nx = \u03bb \u2212\nt0\nt0\n\"\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013 #\nt 2/3\nt 1/3\ny = 3t0 \u03bb\n\u2212\n.\n(36)\nt0\nt0\nThus,\nh\ni\n\u03bb2 10t4/3 \u2212 22t + 13t2/3 > t4/3 .\n\n(37)\n\nThe trajectory will intersect the interface if equation (37) is an equality.\nBy means of the quadratic formula, an intersection will occur if\np\n11 \u00b1 \u22129 + 13/\u03bb2\n1/3\n.\n(38)\nt =\n10 \u2212 1/\u03bb2\n\u221a\nIt will be observed that for \u03bb < 13/3 there are two\n\u221a real roots. If\n\u03bb = 1, then t1/3 = 1, 13/9. On the other hand, if \u03bb > \u221a 13/3, the roots\nare imaginary, so there are no intersections. If \u03bb = 13/3 there is a\ndouble root at t1/3 = 13/11. In this case the parabolic trajectory just\ngrazes the metric interface.\n\u221a In figure 1, I illustrate the two different trajectories when r0 =\n13/3 and \u03c6\u03070 = 1.0. In the case where r0 is just any arbitrary amount\nsmaller, the expanding interface overtakes the test particle following its\nFriedmann-Lema\u0131\u0302tre parabolic trajectory and it must then follow the\nstatic Schwarzschild equations of motion. The Schwarzschild metric\ntakes over at t = (13/11)3 as explained above, and after that the\ntrajectory is an ellipse with semimajor axis 7.6287 and the semiminor\naxis 3.986. These imply an eccentricity of 0.690 68 and a semilatus\nrectum parameter of p = 2.086. On the other hand, if r0 is any arbitrary amount larger, it escapes the moving interface and continues to\nfollow the parabolic trajectory. It is evident from figure 1 that future\ntrajectories are, in some cases, discontinuous functions of the initial\nconditions for the \"Swiss cheese model.\"\n\neffects2r.tex; 7/05/2019; 8:55; p.10\n\n\fACCELERATING EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE\n\n11\n\nPut another way, the Schwarzschild metric permits closed orbits and\nthe Friedmann-Lema\u0131\u0302tre metric does not. In terms of the latter coordinates, one can choose initial conditions so that the parabolic trajectory\njust grazes the metric interface (fixed radial coordinate in this metric)\nand the speed is low enough that for infinitesimally different initial\nconditions the trajectory crosses the interface and is caught in a bound\nstate, or alternatively misses the interface and proceeds on its parabolic\ntrajectory. All these effects take place in supposedly empty space of the\n\u22122/3\norder of 25h50 million AU from a mass concentration of size M\u2299 , and\nare quite counter to one's physical intuition that such discontinuities\nshould not occur there, except perhaps if the central void was created\nby an explosion leaving a remnant star behind.\nA third answer was provided by Bona and Stela[15]. It is a different\ntype of \"Swiss Cheese Model.\" They insert in a flat space, FriedmannLema\u0131\u0302tre-Robertson-Walker background a spherical patch in which,\ninstead of the Schwarzschild metric, the Liebovitz[16] solution is inserted. In the classification of Krasi\u0144ski[10], this solution is in the \"\u03b2 \u2032 6=\n0\" subfamily of the Szekeres-Szafron family of solutions.

The choice of C1 (\u03c1) does not affect\np\nthe dynamics, so we pick C1 = 23 2GM/c2 \u03c1. This choice suffices to\ncause T44 \u2192 3(\u0227/a)2 as \u03c1 \u2192 \u221e. (Note that different choices of C1 and\nC2 are required for the zero mass case.)\nThis result is substantially unique for a model which has isotropic\nspatial curvature, a non-zero central mass concentration, and is asymptotic, at large distances from that mass, to the Friedmann-Lema\u0131\u0302tre,\nexpanding universe model.

The import of this factor is\nthat the radius of the earth's orbit will be proportional to a3 as the\ngravitational term and the angular momentum term dominate the other\nterms. By Kepler's law that the ratio of the squares of the periods is\nproportional to the cube of the diameters, the year will be proportional\nto a9/2 This means that the year should be increasing at the rate of\nabout 0.73h50 seconds per century. Here h50 is the Hubble constant\nin units of 50 kilometers per second per Megaparsec. Since the value\ncurrently accepted by the International Astronomical Union is +0.0095\nseconds per Julian century[17], the predictions of this model are in very\nserious disagreement with observations. The above results are in terms\nof the time variable \u03c4 . Properly done, we need the results in terms of\ntime measured on the Earth for the Liebovitz line element. The reexpression of this result in terms of \"Earth time\" involves a correction\nof the order of H0 GM\u2299 /(c2 R\u2295 ) where M\u2299 is the mass of the Sun and\nr\u2295 is the radius of the orbit of the Earth. This quantity is of the order\nof 10\u22128 smaller than H0 which is of the order of the predicted effect.\nHence, this latter correction is negligible in this case. There is, of course,\nalso a time independent correction to the relation between earth time\nand \u03c4 of the order of GM\u2299 /(c2 R\u2295 ) but it is not relevant to the effect\ndiscussed here.\nThe conclusion of this section is that in one way or another, all the\nmodels reviewed that join the Schwarzschild metric at small distances\nand the expanding universe metric at large distances have problems of\none sort or another. Panek [18] has stress the need to go beyond the\n\"Swiss Cheese Model\" and has analyzed numerically several different\ndensity profiles.

The McVittie solution mentioned above\nhas isotropic, but inhomogeneous, spatial curvature. The difference\nwith this solution lies in the choice here that the universal expansion\nfactor is a function of the proper time and his choice that it is a function\nof his coordinate time, which is not an invariant quantity.\nSo far, we have not had to discuss \u03b2 \u2032 or \u03b2\u0307 \u2032 , as \u03b2\u0307 given by (47)\nhas sufficed for all our computations.

Baker, Jr.\n\nThere are several special cases for the solution of equation (66).\nFirst, when e\u03b2 is large, the solution is just e\u03b2 = \u03c1a(\u03c4 ), both for the\ncase of \"flat\" and curved space. This solution is just what one expects\nfor the case of expanding Friedmann-Lema\u0131\u0302tre expanding space. The\nquantity e\u03b1 is given by (57) and (8) which is, of course, different for\n\"flat\" and curved space. I illustrate the large e\u03b2 case, and the approach\nto it in fig. 2 for the case of flat space and a(\u03c4 ) = (\u03c4 /\u03c40 )2/3 . The initial\nconditions (58) insure that e\u03b2 /[\u03c1\u0302a(\u03c40 )] = 1 in every case. The central\nmass has been chosen to be that of the Sun.\nThe next special case is when e\u03b2 is small. In this case, in line with\nwith the Lema\u0131\u0302tre form of the Schwarzschild metric, it is appropriate\nto plot the results vs. (\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c40 )/\u03c1\u03023/2 . This is because this form of the\n(static) metric can be written as\n\" r\n\u0013#2/3\n\u0012\nc(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c40 )\n3 2GM\ne\u03b2\n=\n1\u2212\n\u03c1\u0302\n2\nc2\n\u03c1\u03023/2\n\n(67)\n\nI illustrate this case and the the approach to this limit in fig. 3.

It turns out that it depends on the exponent\n\u03b3 defined in the limit as \u03c4 \u2192 0 by a(\u03c4 ) \u224d W \u03c4 \u03b3 .

The effects however are\nof some significance for intermediate values of e\u03b2 .

DOMAINS OF ATTRACTION\nIn this section we will focus our attention on the slow-speed (52), flatspace[1, 2] limit of (29) for radial motion only. That is to say, C0 = 0.\nHence, using the dimensionless variables of (65), we obtain,\n\uf8ee\n!3 \uf8f9\n\uf8f0 \u0226\u00c4 \u2212 \u0226 \uf8fb R\n!2\nA2\nA\n\u0226\nM\nR\u0308 =\n(71)\nR+ \uf8ee\n\u2212 2\n\uf8f9\n1/2\n!\nA\nR\n2\n2M\n\uf8f0 \u0226\n+ 3\uf8fb\nA\nR\n\nwhere R = H0 e\u03b2 /c. First consider the case where the rate of expansion\nof the universe is decreasing. Then \u00c4 < 0. If we divide (71) by (\u0226/A)2 R\nand let x = MA2 /(R3 \u02262 ), then it becomes\n\u0012\n\nA\n\u0226\n\n\u00132\n\n \u0308\nAA\nR\u0308\n1\n+\n=1\u2212x\u2212 \u221a\n\u221a\nR\n1 + 2x \u02262 1 + 2x\n\n(72)\n\nNote that the \u00c4 term in (72) is uniformly negative over the allowed\nrange of x, (0 \u2264 x \u2264 \u221e). Hence we may check all the cases \u00c4 \u2264 0\nby setting it to zero. This being done, we may compute in a straight\nforward manner that for very small x, the right-hand side is just \u22121.5x2 .\nDifferentiation with respect to x shows that the derivative is uniformly\nnegative. Thus we conclude that if the rate of expansion of the universe\nis not increasing, then according to the metric of found in section IV,\nthere is just one domain of attraction and it is centered on the mass\nconcentration as (72) shows that if \u00c4 \u2264 0, then R\u0308 < 0. The analogous\ncomputations for curved space proceed in a similar manner, but are a\nbit more complicated.\nNext let us consider the case where, as reported by Reiss et al.[3] and\nPerlmutter et al.[4], the rate of expansion of the universe is increasing.\nAs for this case, \u00c4 > 0, it follows directly from (71) that in the limit\nas R \u2192 \u221e, R\u0308 > 0. Since it is also the case that when R \u2192 0, R\u0308 < 0,\nit follows that there exists an RD for which R\u0308 = 0. Therefore, we now\nhave two domains of attraction. One is 0 \u2264 R < RD . In this domain,\nall test particles at rest with respect to the coordinate system appear\nto be accelerating towards the origin. The other domain is RD < R.\nIn this domain all test particles at rest with respect to the coordinate\nsystem appear to be accelerating towards infinity. One expects that\nover time, the neighborhood of the domain boundary will be swept\nclean of particles.\n\neffects2r.tex; 7/05/2019; 8:55; p.19\n\n\f20\n\nGeorge A. Baker, Jr.\n\nNote is taken that the \"Swiss cheese model\" also has 2 domains of\nattraction. This fact is independent of the sign of \u00e4. Also the location\nof the boundary described by R increases with time.\nAt this point it is convenient to define the standard acceleration/de \u0308 \u02262 ). Then, setting R\u0308 = 0, the equaceleration parameter q0 \u2261 \u2212AA/(\ntion for the domain boundary becomes, by (72),\nq0 + 1\n0=1\u2212x\u2212 \u221a\n1 + 2x\n\n(73)\n\nThe value of q0 is given[21] by the equation,\nq0 = 12 \u03a9M \u2212 \u03a9\u039b\n\n(74)\n\nwhere, combining the results of [1, 2, 3, 4] we deduce the values \u03a9M =\n8\u03c0G\u03c10 /(3H02 ) \u2248 0.19 and \u03a9\u039b = \u039bc2 /(3H02 ) \u2248 0.81. These values yield\nq0 \u2248 \u22120.715. Note that for \"flat\" space, \u22121 \u2264 q0 , as 0 \u2264 \u03a9M . Some\nsimple manipulations convert (73) into a cubic equation in x.\n2x3D \u2212 3x2D + 1 = (1 + q0 )2\n\n(75)\n\nThis equation is simply solved by standard methods. Its solutions, of\ncourse, also include those for the other sign of the square root in (73).\nEvidently, the solutions of (73) all lie in the range 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1. If q0 \u2265 0,\nthere are no positive real roots of (73) and we take xD (q0 ) = 0. If\nq0 < 0, then there is one positive real solution xD (q0 ) of (73). For the\nabove mentioned case, xD (\u22120.715) \u2248 0.825.\nWe now have the domain-size\u2013mass relation,\nGM a2\nrD =\nxD (q0 )\u02272\n\u0014\n\n\u0015 13\n\n.\n\n(76)\n\nHere rD is the radius of the domain and M is the interior mass. We\nappeal to the uniqueness (in our class of models) reported at the end\nof the fourth section to allow us to treat all the mass as concentrated\nin the center of the domain. See also the result (16) in this regard.\nThe domain-size\u2013mass relation is an important conclusion which is of\nparticular interest if the rate of expansion of the universe is accelerating,\nas has recently been reported[3, 4].\nIt is to be noted that many mass concentrations are rotating and so\nare only axisymmetric, rather than spherically symmetric. This means\nthat near the mass concentration the metric has some of the characteristics of the Kerr metric. In terms of Cartesian coordinates, the differences in the far-field between the Kerr metric and the Schwarzschild\nmetric [8] are g4i \u224d 2G(~r \u00d7 I~ * ~ei )/(rc)3 , where the ~ei are unit vectors\n\neffects2r.tex; 7/05/2019; 8:55; p.20\n\n\fACCELERATING EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE\n\n21\n\nin the x, y, z directions and I~ is the angular momentum of the central\nmass concentration. In regions where this correction is relatively small\n~\ncompared to the gravitation term 2GM/(c2 r), i.e., |~r \u00d7 I|/(M\ncr 2 ) \u226a 1,\nwe may safely neglect this effect. On the other hand, where the correction is significant, the precise details of this effect will require further\nstudy. In addition, our lack of a clear knowledge of the distribution of\ndark matter also creates uncertainty concerning the details the above\nobtained results.\nWe now consider a few applications of the domain-size\u2013mass relation. If we use the solar mass, we get the radius of the domain boundary\n\u22122/3\nto be about 417h50 light years. However, in this case the density of\nstars is sufficiently high so as to perturb significantly this result. The\nOort cloud only extends out to about 0.8 light years. We remark that\nthe domain-size\u2013mass relation only provides an upper limit on the size\nof a structure that a given mass can be expected to hold together. That\nthere are smaller structures can presumably be explained on the basis\nof other circumstances.\nNext consider a globular cluster. They are observed to have about\n10,000 to 1,000,000 stars and to have diameters of several 10's of\nlight years to about 200 light years. The computed domain boundary\n\u22122/3\n\u22122/3\ndiameters for systems of this size are about 9000h50\n- 42000h50\nlight years. This result is of the substantially larger than that which is\nobserved. It may be that they are reduced in size when they orbit near\nthe galactic center.\nLet us now consider our galaxy. It is estimated to contain something\nlike 200 billion stars and to have a mass of 700 billion to 1 trillion solar\n\u22122/3\n\u22122/3\nmasses. This mass implies a domain radius of 3.7h50\nto 4.2h50\nmillion light years, which way off from the observationally estimated\ndiameter of about 100 thousand light years.\nWhen we consider the Local Group and the Virgo Cluster, the\nproblem becomes more interesting. Specifically, it has been estimated\nthat the roughly 30 galaxies in the local group have a mass of about\n3 \u00d7 1012 M\u2299 , not counting intergalactic dark matter. This mass corre\u22122/3\nsponds to about a radius of 6h50 million light years. The observed\nvalue is roughly 4 million light years. In the Virgo Cluster of around\n2000 galaxies, the mass is thought to be of the order of 1015 M\u2299 . This\nmass includes a significant amount of dark matter and gives a radius\n\u22122/3\nof about 42h50 million light years, compared to the observation that\nthe Milky Way galaxy lies about 65 million light years from center of\nthe cluster. Considering the errors and the fact that the Virgo Cluster\nappears not to be in equilibrium yet, this agreement is not too bad.\n\neffects2r.tex; 7/05/2019; 8:55; p.21\n\n\f22\n\nGeorge A. Baker, Jr.\n\nIn conclusion, it appears that for larger scale structures composed\nof galaxies and inter-galactic space, the observed increase in the rate of\nexpansion may be an important feature in determining the size of selfbound gravitating systems. For smaller structures like galaxies, globular\nclusters etc. other mechanisms are presumably dominant.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe author is pleased to acknowledge helpful conversations with N.\nBalazs, S.
