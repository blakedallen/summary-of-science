Although\nthere are a large number of perovskite HTSC materials, the YBa2 Cu3 O6+x (YBCO6+x) family has a special\nplace. It was the first superconductor discovered[2] with\na transition temperature Tc above liquid nitrogen temperature with a relatively simple synthesis route. It is\navailable in almost the entire region of the phase diagram, easily tuned by varying the oxygen content in a\nquasi\u2013continuous way. Thus it is appealing for probing\nthe intrinsic properties of HTSCs. In the underdoped\nregime, a variety of crossover phenomena are observed at\ntemperatures above Tc in which various forms of spectral\nweight at low energies are suppressed. These phenomena\nare associated with the opening of a pseudogap[3]. To\nhelp elucidate the nature of this pseudogap, it is desirable to have highly stoichiometric crystals with a high\ndegree of crystalline order. In particular, such samples\nare needed if one wants to determine whether or not the\ncrossover behaviors are transistions smeared by disorder\nand/or impurities[4].\nYBCO6+x can be prepared in the whole range of oxygen content 6 + x = 6.0 to slightly larger than 7.0. The\noxygen content affects the crystallographic structure of\nthe material[5]. At x=1.0, the crystal structure consists of a bilayer of two\u2013dimensional (2D) CuO2 planes\nand a single layer of one\u2013dimensional (1D) Cu\u2013O\u2013Cu\nchains, hereafter denoted the CuO chain layer. Nuclear\nmagnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy offers a unique\nprobe to investigate the microscopic properties of the\nCuO2 planes and CuO chain layers separately. In particular, the response of inequivalent sites can in principle\nbe resolved in NMR spectra and the dynamical prop-\n\n\u2217 e-mail:statt@physics.utoronto.ca\n\nerties of these sites studied by nuclear relaxation. The\nchains are important not only because of their role as\ncharge reservoirs and their proximity to the superconducting CuO2 planes, but also because of their low dimensionality. It is well known that charge/spin density\nwave(CDW/SDW) ground states are prevalent in quasi\u2013\none dimensional systems[6]. Therefore, the chains in this\nsystem present an important opportunity for clarifying\nthe question of whether such transitions exist in HTSC.\nIn fact this has been the subject of study in the stoichiometric compound YBa2 Cu4 O8 containing two CuO chain\nlayers, where evidence for the presence of incommensurate CDW fluctuations, near the wave vector 2kF occurring below 180 K has been reported[7]. There are a few\nreports on charge modulations in YBCO7 as well[8]. Perhaps the most striking evidence for charge oscillations in\nthe chains of YBCO7 is provided by STM observations[9].\nThe structural phase diagram of YBCO6+x has\nbeen studied in great detail; early neutron diffraction\nreveal[10] a tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transition\nas the sample is cooled from the growth temperature,\nin which oxygens form 1D CuO chains and thus break\nthe tetragonal symmetry. Typically the chain ordering\noccurs in domains and the samples need to be mechanically detwinned in order to produce crystals with a single\norientation of chains.\nDepending on the preparation conditions and oxygen\ncontent, oxygen atoms arrange themselves in different\ntypes of ordering in the CuO chain layers. Efforts to\nproduce crystals with domains of long chains requires\nan understanding of oxygen ordering in the chain layer.\nIn addition to the orthorhombic structure (Ortho\u2013I, full\nchains) at x=1.0 (Fig. 1 (ii)) and tetragonal phase (T,\nempty chains) at x=0.0 (Fig. 1 (iii)), at least four more\nmodified orthorhombic structures have been observed[11]\nsuch as Ortho\u2013II (Fig. 1 (i)) for 6.35 \u2264 6+x \u2264 6.62\nwith alternating full and empty chains. There have been\ntheoretical studies based on lattice gas models to explain the structural phase diagram of YBCO6+x[12].\nThese models can be shown to be equivalent to the Ising\nmodel with asymmetric next nearest neighbor interac-\n\n\f2\ntions (ASYNNNI model) which use three pair potentials\nbetween oxygen atoms in CuO chain layers: V1 for nearest oxygen neighbor pairs, V2 for next nearest pairs connected through a Cu ion and V3 for those without Cu\nin between, with the condition V2 < 0 < V3 < V1 . It is\nthe strongly repulsive interaction V1 of two inter-chain\nnearest neighbor oxygen ions which prevents the occupation of nearest neighbor oxygen sites and promotes the\nformation of chains. Long chain segments are induced by\nthe attractive potential V2 between two intra-chain next\nnearest neighbor oxygen ions connected through a Cu\nion. Alternating sequences of full and empty chains follow from the weak repulsive V3 between two inter-chain\nnext nearest neighbor oxygen ions.\nIn YBCO6+x, Tc changes from the maximum 92.5\nK at optimal doping to zero for fully oxygen depleted\nsamples[13]. This change takes place in a nonlinear manner with a pronounced plateau at 60 K for 6.45 \u2264 6+x \u2264\n6.65 and a broad maximum at 92.5 K for 6.85 \u2264 6+x \u2264\n7.0. These features are associated with the Ortho\u2013II and\nOrtho\u2013I ordered phases, respectively. It is suggested [14]\nthat this correlation has to do with charge transfer rather\nthan with any specific Tc of the ordered phases. The\nimportance of oxygen ordering in the CuO chain layers\nin determining the charge transfer was first noted in a\nstudy of the time dependence of Tc during room temperature annealing of quenched samples[15]. With the\noxygen content (average occupancy of different oxygen\nsites) remaining constant, the degree of oxygen ordering\nincreased with time. This resulted in an increase in the\northorhombicity and in Tc . It was shown that the rearrangement of oxygen ions in the chain layers to form\nlonger chain segments was responsible for this increase.\nAnother experimental indication of the presence of a minimum chain length for the charge transfer to take place is\nthe TN vs. oxygen content for small x: TN is nearly constant for 6+x \u22646.2 [16]. The relationship between oxygen\nordering and hole concentration has been addressed[17]\ntheoretically by band structure calculations. Chain fragments were found to be unable to transfer charge to the\nplanes until they exceeded a critical length equal to three\n(containing three Cu and two O atoms). An alternative\nmodel combining the ASYNNNI and the charge transfer models has also been[18] successful in explaining the\nvariation of Tc vs. x. Here it is assumed that only the\nordered phase participates in superconductivity. Thus\nthere is a minimum domain size below which no charge\ntransfer can take place.\nNMR experiments can be used to measure the electric\nfield gradient (EFG) in materials. Since the EFG at a nucleus depends on the symmetry of that site, the valence of\nthe ion itself and the charge of its environment, valuable\ninformation about the electronic structure of the system\nunder study can be obtained by such measurements; i.e.\ncharge transfer. However, the interpretation can be complicated if the samples are not single phase or suffer from\nimpurities and/or disorder. There are a number of NMR\nreports on underdoped YBCO6+x with different oxygen\n\nEmpty Chain\n\nFull Chain\n\nCuO\nBaO\nCuO2\nY\nCu(2F)\n\nCuO2\n\nCu(2E)\n\nBaO\nc\n\nCuO\nCu(1F)\n\na\nCu(1E)\n\nb\n\n(i) Ortho-II (YBa2Cu3O6.5)\n\nCu(2)\n\nCu(2)\n\nCu(1)2\n\nCu(1)4\n\n(iii) Tetragonal (YBa2Cu3O6)\n\n(ii) Ortho-I (YBa2Cu3O7)\nCu\nO\n\nBa\nY\n\nFIG. 1: The crystal structure of YBCO6+x for (i) x=0.5\n(Ortho\u2013II) (ii) x=1.0 (Ortho-I) and (iii) x=0.0 (T).\n\ncontents[19, 20, 21, 22, 23] where either the sample is\nnot stoichiometric or suffers from oxygen inhomogeneity,\npowder averaging or twinning. L\u00fctgemeier's group[22]\nwas the first to study the effects of oxygen ordering on\nthe NMR properties of YBCO6+x. However, they used\naligned powdered samples where the NMR resonances\nwere broadened by non\u2013stoichiometry and oxygen disorder. For Ortho\u2013II ordering only a partially resolved\nsplitting of the resonance line from the CuO2 plane was\nobserved.\nWith recent enhancements in crystal growth very\npure and highly ordered detwinned Ortho\u2013II crystals\nwith large oxygen\u2013ordered domain size have become\navailable[24]. To probe the intrinsic properties of the\nOrtho\u2013II phase of YBCO we have performed NMR ex-\n\n\f3\nperiments on highly ordered detwinned Ortho\u2013II single\ncrystals of YBa2 Cu3 O6.5 (YBCO6.5). We report NMR\nspectra and line assignments for these Ortho\u2013II crystals\ntogether with NMR evidence pertaining to the quality of\nthe crystals, specifically regarding the chain lengths and\nthe lack of oxygen disorder. We also report EFG parameters for different Cu sites in Ortho\u2013II structure along\nwith an analysis regarding lattice and valence charge contributions. We will discuss the relation between oxygen\nordering and charge transfer in the Ortho\u2013II structure.\nIt will be shown that these crystals are an extremely important disorder\u2013free prototype of the underdoped state\nof HTSC.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENT\n\nSingle crystals of YBCO6.5 were grown by a flux\nmethod using BaZrO3 crucibles[24]. The crystals were\nfirst detwinned and then the oxygen content set to 6.50\nduring the final annealing process. The NMR properties\nof two such crystals used in our experiments proved to be\nidentical to within experimental error. Hence we will not\ndistinguish between them. The crystals were 2 mm \u00d7 2.5\nmm wide and \u223c 0.1 mm thick platelets with the c\u2013axis\nperpendicular to the platelet and a and b axes parallel\nto the edges of the platelet. The superconducting transitions of the crystals measured by a SQUID magnetometer give Tc = 62 K with a transition width \u2206Tc = 0.6 K.\nX\u2013ray diffraction measurements performed on these crystals show a three\u2013dimensional Ortho\u2013II oxygen ordering\nwith long correlation lengths 148, 430 and 58 \u00c5 along the\na, b and c crystallographic axes, respectively[24]. The\nlong correlation length along the b (chain) axis indicates\nthe presence of much longer chains than have been available previously[22]. Both the large oxygen\u2013ordered domain size and a small \u2206Tc are indicative of high degree\nof oxygen homogeneity in these crystals. Because twin\nboundaries promote oxygen clustering, the removal of\ntwin boundaries was found to be essential for obtaining a\nhighly ordered Ortho\u2013II phase[24]. Single crystal X\u2013ray\ndiffraction measurements on our crystals showed at most\n10% of the sample was twinned.\nCu NMR data were taken between 30 and 250 K and\nmagnetic fields up to 9 T with a home built pulsed spectrometer with quadrature detection. The crystal was\nplaced in either a Pt or Au rectangular coil tunable from\n30 to 100 MHz. A rectangular coil was chosen to conform\nto the shape of the crystal and so maximize the filling factor. The onset of the superconducting transition of the\nsample was observed in situ at 62 K by a sharp change in\nthe inductance of the tuned coil at zero applied magnetic\nfield. A powder Al reference sample was located in the\ncoil adjacent to the sample to calibrate the value of the\nmagnetic field at the sample position.\nThe data were obtained with a standard two\u2013pulse\nspin\u2013echo sequence, with 4 \u03bcs pulse length and 30 to\n40 \u03bcs pulse separation. Copper nuclei have two isotopes\n\nCu and 65 Cu with spin 23 . Each isotope gives one\ncentral transition ( 21 \u2194 \u2212 21 ) and two satellites (\u00b1 32 \u2194\n\u00b1 21 ). To obtain the complete Cu NMR spectrum of the\nsample we used either field or frequency sweep methods.\nThe spectra were then constructed by superimposing the\nFourier transform spectra of the spin echo measured at a\ncertain frequency or field interval. There was no attempt\nto correct the signal intensity for T2 or frequency dependencies in frequency sweep measurements, given the latter's narrow range. Although the samples are high quality, because of their small volume a significant amount\nof signal averaging was required to obtain a satisfactory\nsignal to noise (S/N) ratio.\n63\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA.\n\nLine Assignment\n\nTypical 63 Cu NMR spectra of central transitions obtained at 60 K at 75.75 MHz for the applied field parallel\nto the a\u2013axis (H0 ||a) are shown in Fig. 2. Similar spectra\nwere also observed for H0 ||b containing four resonance\nlines but at different positions. We denote the observed\nlines in Fig. 2 by A, B, C and D. The spectrum for A\u2013D\nresonances has also been obtained for 65 Cu with intensities consistent with the natural abundances of the two\nisotopes. These four Cu resonances are associated with\nthe four inequivalent Cu sites in the unit cell as expected\nfrom the Ortho\u2013II crystal structure (Fig. 1(i)). Two lines\nA and C appear nearly with the same width, integrated\narea and relaxation rates. Line B has a very long spin\u2013\nlattice relaxation time (nearly three order of magnitude\nlonger than A and C) and is relatively narrow compared\nto the rest of the lines. Line D is broader compared to\nline A and C and has an order of magnitude longer relaxation time. It should be noted that these resonance\nlines are well resolved and that there appears to be no\nbackground signal under these lines. Also note that a relatively long repetition time of 250 msec must be used in\norder not to saturate line B. Most of the spectra are collected with a shorter repetition time of 25 msec in order\nto saturate line B which otherwise obscures line A.\nLine assignments will be made by comparing the local\nparameters of the four Cu sites with those of YBCO6 and\nYBCO7. To motivate this comparison consider the structural environmemt of each Cu site. Ortho\u2013II YBCO consists of alternating full and empty chains (see Fig. 1(i))\nand hence there are two inequivalent Cu sites in CuO\nchain layers, one in full Cu(1F) and one in empty Cu(1E)\nchains. Correspondingly there are two inequivalent Cu\nsites in the CuO2 planes, adjacent to full and empty\nchains Cu(2F) and Cu(2E), respectively. Comparing\nthe crystal structure of Ortho\u2013II with that of YBCO7\n(Fig. 1(ii)), one concludes that the local structural environments of Cu(2F) and Cu(1F) are similar to that of\nCu(2) in the plane and four\u2013fold coordinated Cu in the\nchain layers Cu(1)4 in YBCO7, respectively. Similarly,\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 3: The complete Cu NMR spectrum at 70 K and 64.85\nMHz for H0 ||c. For this direction, the central transitions and\nlower satellites of A and C lines overlap.\n\nFIG. 2: 63 Cu NMR spectra for central transitions at 60 K and\n75.75 MHz for H0 ||a taken at different repetition time, Trep\n(top panel: Trep =250 msec, middle panel: Trep =25 msec, and\nlower panel: the difference). The horizontal arrow indicates\nthe possible range for Cu(1)3 . See text for details. The two\nnarrow and small signals in the far right side of the spectra\nare from Cu metal in the sample probe.\n\nthe Cu(2E) and Cu(1E) sites have the same local structural environment as Cu(2) in the plane and two\u2013fold\ncoordinated Cu in the chain layers Cu(1)2 in YBCO6.\nNMR parameters for these lines will be compared with\nthe known[25, 26, 27] NMR parameters (Knight shifts,\nnuclear quadrupole frequency and asymmetry parameters) of the corresponding sites in YBCO7 and YBCO6\nto determine the line assignments.\nIn order to obtain the NMR parameters for the observed lines, we have measured the complete 63/65 Cu\nspectrum including the satellite and central transitions\nat different frequencies and fields along the three crystallographic axes. A typical complete spectrum is shown in\nFig. 3 for H0 ||c at 70 K. Note that for this direction of the\napplied field, the central and lower satellite transitions of\nlines A and C overlap. The spectra were analyzed using second order perturbation theory for the quadrupolar shift to the Zeeman interaction (see Appendix) for\ncentral transitions and by exact diagonalization for H0\nparallel to crystallographic axes for the satellites since\nsecond order perturbation theory is insufficient for these\nresonances.\nIf one writes the resonance frequency \u03bd (see Appendix)\nof the central transition to the second order as\n\u03bd\n1\nf (\u03bdQ , \u03b7, \u03b8, \u03c6)\n\u2212 1 = Kef f = K +\n(3.1)\n\u03b3 n H0\n1+K\n(\u03b3n H0 )2\n\n1\nit is easily seen that Kef f is a linear function of (\u03b3n H\n2\n0)\nwith the intercept equal to K and the slope proportional\nto the quadrupolar coupling constant for that direction.\nFor example, in Fig. 4, we have shown this data for the\ncentral transition of the line D obtained at 70 K and for\nH0 ||b. We have used the position of the center of gravity of this line to obtain Kef f since this line is broad at\nlow temperatures. The Knight shifts and EFG parameters are obtained for all sites with a simultaneous fit of\nthe central transition and satellite data in the three field\norientations[28].\n\nn\n\n1\nFIG. 4: Kef f as a function of (\u03b3n H\n2 for the\n0)\ntransition of the D line at 70 K, H0 ||b.\n\n63\n\nCu central\n\nThe NMR parameters for the four observed lines in\nthe normal state are reported in Table I. For comparison\nwe have listed the NMR parameters of Cu(2) and Cu(1)4\n\n\f5\nsites in YBCO7 and Cu(2) and Cu(1)2 sites in YBCO6 in\nTable II[25, 26, 27]. We can readily assign the four resonances observed in Ortho\u2013II to the four different crystallographic sites by comparing their NMR parameters to\nthose of Cu sites in YBCO7 and YBCO6. This comparison shows that the two lines A and C, with very similar\nfeatures, come from the planes; A from the planar Cu\nsites adjacent to the full chains Cu(2F) and C from the\nplanar Cu sites adjacent to the empty chains Cu(2E).\nThe EFG principal axis for both sites is along the c\u2013\naxis which is the same for the Cu(2) sites in YBCO7 and\nYBCO6. The asymmetry parameter for these sites is very\nsmall (nearly axially symmetric) as with the Cu(2) sites\nin YBCO7 and YBCO6. The slightly larger asymmetry\nparameter observed in Ortho\u2013II might be explained by\ncrystal structure arguments since Ortho\u2013II structure has\na lower symmetry than the Ortho\u2013I or tetragonal phases.\nThe Cu(2F) and Cu(2E) resonances appear at different\npositions because of their different quadrupolar coupling\nconstants. Since the quadrupolar coupling depends on\nthe ion's surrounding charge distribution as well as the\nlocal charge at the position of the ion, a different coupling is expected for the two planar Cu sites as observed.\nWe will discuss the contribution of the lattice and valence\nelectrons to this coupling in more detail below. The \u03bdQ\nfor Cu(2E) is higher than the observed one in YBCO6,\nconsistent with the trend of \u03bdQ vs. doping[29]. The same\nintensity of the Cu(2F) and Cu(2E) lines[30] within our\nS/N is an indication that there are equal numbers of these\nsites in the crystal. Hence there is a high degree of ordering in the chain layers with a periodic sequence of full and\nempty chains. The mere fact that we have observed only\ntwo distinct Cu(2) signals for both satellite and central\ntransitions (Fig. 3) is suggestive of a complete ordering\nof the full and empty chains. In a disordered structure\nthe signal would merge to one broad resonance with some\nsplitting depending on the degree of ordering. Such partially resolved splittings for the planar Cu resonances is\ntypical[22] in previous generations of YBCO6+x samples.\nThe resonance line B appears in the same frequency\nrange as Cu(2F) but can be distinguished by its much\nlonger relaxation time. In fact, among the four observed\nresonance lines, B has the smallest width, Knight shift\nand the longest relaxation time (of order seconds) comparable with that of Cu(1)2 in the insulating tetragonal\nphase of YBCO6[31]. A comparison of the NMR parameters of this line with Cu(1)2 present in YBCO6 with\nempty chains leads us to assign this line to Cu(1E) in\nthe Ortho\u2013II structure. Similar to Cu(1)2 , the Cu(1E)\nresonance has axial symmetry. The long spin\u2013lattice relaxation time is interpreted as a result of a low conduction\nelectron density at the resonant nucleus. This is consistent with the Cu ions being in the 3d10 electronic configuration. A small Knight shift is also consistent with a\nlow density of conduction electrons at this site. In addition, the fact that the resonance signal from this site is\nvery narrow is in agreement with this conclusion because\ninsulating sites tend to be much more uniform in nature\n\nthan conducting ones as they lack an inhomogeneous Ks\ncomponent. The Cu(1E) linewidth is 40 kHz at 60 K with\nH0 ||a = 6.5 T for different directions of applied field and\nbecomes even narrower at higher temperatures.\nLine D is broader than other resonances, at least at\nlow temperatures. We have found a large value for its\nasymmetry parameter (see Table I). The highly asymmetric behavior of the EFG is reminiscent of Cu(1)4 in\nYBCO7. This fact together with its similar \u03bdQ has led\nus to assign this line to the Cu(1F) site. An examination\nof Cu(1F) site symmetry explains its highly asymmetric\nnature. In the Ortho\u2013II structure, the Cu(1F) sites are\nsurrounded by four oxygen ions, two chain oxygens and\ntwo apical oxygens. Since these oxygen neighbors are not\nall equivalent, a non-symmetric EFG is expected. To understand the nature of the broadening of this line at low\ntemperatures, we have studied the line shape and relaxation rates for several directions of the applied field. We\nattribute this broadening to the presence of Friedel\u2013like\noscillations nucleated at the chain ends. The details of\nthis study will be presented elsewhere[32].\nWe have confirmed that the ratio of quadrupolar shifts\nof the two isotopes measured at the same site differs by\ntheir quadrupole moment (63 Q/65 Q = 1.079[28]) for all\nsites. This indicates that no internal magnetic field, due\nto static magnetic moments, is present at these Cu sites\nsince such a field would shift or broaden the lines. This is\nin disagreement with some neutron\u2013scattering measurements where a moment of \u223c 0.05 \u03bcB is observed[33] in\nYBCO6.5 and of \u223c 0.02 \u03bcB in YBCO6.6[34] for copper sites in the CuO2 planes, and with \u03bcSR results on\nYBCO6.67 showing[35] the existence of static magnetism\nin these planes. A magnetic moment of the order of \u223c\n0.02 \u03bcB would have shifted or broadened the Cu(2F/E)\nlines by about 3 MHz which we would have easily observed. More recent neutron scattering experiments on\nOrtho\u2013II found[36] no evidence for the presence of static\nmagnetic moments. Also, in a further work, it was\nshown[37] that the \u03bcSR results might arise from charge\ninhomogeneity rather than magnetic order.\nTo further elucidate this apparent discrepency several\nfactors should be noted. As reported by Sidis et al.[33]\ntheir static moments fluctuate on a nanosecond time scale\nwhich would average out these moments on the NMR\ntime scale. However this still does not settle the discrepancy with the work of Stock et al.[36]. In this experiment the Ortho\u2013II sample is much more stoichiometric\nthan that of Sidis et al.or the YBCO6.6 sample of Mook\net al.. Thus, as suggested by Stock et al., oxygen disorder in the chains may be responsible for establishing\nmagnetic order there. With respect to the \u03bcSR results,\nSonier et al.[37] have suggested that for samples with x >\n6.5 local charge inhomogeneity, caused by CDW in the\nchains as shown by Gr\u00e9vin et al.[8] could lead to magnetic moments via the stripe mechanism. However for the\nOrtho\u2013II concentration of x = 6.5 no \u03bcSR signature of a\nCDW was detected. From our work on the Cu(1F) line\nmentioned above[32] we have established that a Friedel\u2013\n\n\f6\nTABLE I: Experimental NMR parameters for the four observed lines at 70 K.

Thus\nthe CDW/stripe mechanism need not be invoked in the\ncase of stoichiometric Ortho\u2013II YBCO.\n\nB.\n\nChain Length\n\nWe now estimate the chain lengths from our NMR\ndata. In YBCO6+x compounds with intermediate oxygen content, a resonance line with \u03bdN QR \u2243 23 MHz is\nobserved[22] and is associated with three\u2013fold coordinated Cu(1)3 sites corresponding to the terminal Cu ion\nof the full chains with a relative abundance that diminishes with increasing length of the chain segments. A\nsimilar value of \u03bdQ for Cu(1)3 and Cu(1F) sites together\nwith the fact that Cu(1F) is very broad at low temperatures, makes it difficult to obtain a precise value for the\nconcentration of these sites in our sample. As discussed\nabove we expect the concentration of Cu(1)3 to be low.\nIn fact, in the complete NMR spectrum for Ortho\u2013II measured between 1 to 9 T, to within our S/N we did not\nobserve any signal that could not be assigned to the four\ninequivalent sites in the structure. Hence, we can only\nestimate an upper limit on the number of Cu(1)3 sites\nfrom our S/N and ultimately a lower limit on the chain\nlength in our sample.\nTo put a quantitative limit on the concentration of\nCu(1)3 sites, we consider two sets of spectra. The first\none was taken at 250 K where Cu(1F) is considerably\nnarrower than the one at 70 K. The Friedel\u2013like oscillations are thermally smeared out at this high temperature. In Fig. 5 we have shown this spectra for H0 ||c. We\nhave used the established NMR parameters of the Cu(1)3\n\nb\n\n\u03b7\n0.01\u00b10.01\n0.95 \u00b10.02\n0\n0\n\nEFG\u2013PA\nc\na\nc\nc\n\nTaken from Ref.[27] at 505 K.\n\nsites[22, 38] (\u03bdN QR = 23.77 MHz, \u03b7 = 0.3 and Vzz ||b) to\ncalculate its possible position. The horizontal arrow in\nFig. 5 covers the range consistent with parameter uncertainties. From the relative intensities of Cu(1F), I4 ,\nand Cu(1)3 , I3 , one is able in principle to find the mean\nnumber of oxygen atoms in the full chains (chain length)\naccording to the relation[22]: n=1+2I4 /I3 . Since we have\nnot observed any additional peaks due to Cu(1)3 , we can\nonly put a limit on the maximum intensity of I3 from our\nS/N. To obtain this limit, we have assumed the Cu(1)3\nline has the same NQR width as observed by Yasuoka et\nal. [20] leading to an NMR linewidth of 66 kHz. If we\nassume we can detect such a line with S/N of two then we\nobtain a lower limit of 32 lattice constants for the chain\nlength. The inset to Fig. 5 illustrates the Cu(1)3 signal\nexpected for n=30 and n=60.\nThe second set of spectra was taken at 60 K with H0 ||a.\nIn this case we use the fact that the relaxation rate of\nthe Cu(1)3 site is relatively slow[39] to extract only the\nslowly relaxing components. As illustrated in Fig. 2, two\nspectra taken at a repetition time of 25 msec. and 250\nmsec. have been subtracted to reveal the Cu(1E) line as\nexpected and no other line. As above we put an upper\nlimit on the chain length given our S/N. The calculated\nrange for Cu(1)3 is displayed in Fig. 2. Our estimate of\nthe chain length from this analysis is 50 lattice constants.\nThese estimates are consistent with the XRD result\nof 110 lattice constants for the domain size along the\nchain direction. Using the ASYNNNI model we have\nperformed Monte Carlo calculations to determine what\nthe domain interface looks like for the two cases of (a) the\ncase of a twin boundary and (b) parallel chains that are\nout of phase, i.e. FEFE adjoining EFEF (see Fig. 6). In\nboth cases a linear boundary is preferred as the ground\nstate with Cu(1)3 atoms at the domain boundary. Thus\n\n\f7\nwe expect to have three\u2013fold coordinated copper sites at\nleast along the domain boundaries normal to b and more\nalong the twin boundaries to the extent that they exist in\nour crystals. Hence the relative concentration of Cu(1)3\nsites should be I3 /I4 \u2243 2% from the XRD results whereas\nour detection limit for I3 /I4 \u2243 4%. From the two values\nfor n obtained above, the consistent estimate for the lower\nlimit of the chain lengths is 50 lattice constants.\n\nFIG. 5: 63 Cu NMR spectrum at 250 K and H0 (= 7.96T )||c.\nThe arrow shows the estimated range of the Cu(1)3 resonance.\nInset illustrates presence of Cu(1)3 line synthetically added to\nthe data for two chain lengths.

Line segments represent Cu\u2013O\u2013Cu chains. Chains are\nterminated with Cu(1)3 sites denoted with circles.\n\nIn NMR studies on HTSCs, large linewidths have been\nan obstacle to investigating intrinsic properties. The\nproblem arises from the fact it is not readily obvious\nwhether these large linewidths arise from imperfections\nof the structure such as oxygen disorder or are an intrinsic property of these materials. However, recent im-\n\nprovements in sample preparation techniques have resulted in the observation of narrower lines[40] emphasizing the importance of sample quality in determining\nthe properties of HTSC materials. In general, the observed linewidths can be attributed to the distributions\nin either the EFG parameters (arising from the structure)\nand/or the Knight shift. Our analysis of the linewidths\nof the central transitions vs. applied magnetic field as\nwell as a comparison between the linewidths of central\nand satellite transitions indicates that the line broadening for Cu(2F/E) and Cu(1E) sites is mainly caused by\na distribution of EFG parameters while for Cu(1F) it is\nmainly due to a distribution of the Knight shift. The\nlinewidths of all resonance lines decreases with increasing temperature. The planar Cu sites for H0 ||c have a\nlinewidth of 40 kHz at 250 K. To our knowledge these\nNMR linewidths are the smallest observed for YBCO6.5\nsamples[40], another indication of high sample quality.\nOxygen disorder is a feature of non\u2013stoichiometric\nsamples. Erb et al.[40] have compared the NMR spectra\nof YBCO7 and YBCO6.9. The former has very narrow\nNMR lines. For example the linewidth of Cu(1)4 is 22\nkHz with H0 = 9 T ||c at room temperature. When the\noxygen concentration is reduced by 0.1 the linewidth increases to 183 kHz, as a result of oxygen disorder. Also\nnoted was the presence of Cu(1)2 with a linewidth of\n13 kHz. They argue that this narrow linewidth is a result of oxygen clustering which provides a more uniform\nenvironment for the Cu(1)2 sites than would be the case\nfor randomly distributed oxygen defects. They also argue\nthat the absence of a Cu(1)3 signal is consistent with oxygen clustering as this three\u2013fold coordinated site forms\nthe boundary between full and empty chains. As our\nlinewidths are similar to that of YBCO7 we can infer that\nthere are few oxygen defects in our Ortho\u2013II YBCO6.5\ncrystals. We find that our Cu(1E) linewidth for fields\nalong a and b is 30 kHz at 200 K consistent with few\noxygen defects. Our narrow Cu(1F) line at these high\ntemperatures is also consistent with few oxygen defects.\nThis is relevant to the Cu(1)3 concentration. Although\nwe expect no substantial number of oxygen defects in\nstoichiometric YBCO6.5 the absence of a Cu(1)3 line indicates that our crystals are indeed substantially stoichiometric.\nFrom the NMR spectrum obtained for H0 ||a and b,\nwe are also able to investigate the degree of twinning in\nour crystal. Fig. 7 shows the 63 Cu NMR spectrum for\nCu(2F) and Cu(2E) at 60 K, 75.75 MHz. A remnant of\nCu(1E) is observed on the high side of Cu(2F) as our\npulse sequence to saturate the Cu(1E) signal is not 100%\nefficient. It is evident from the lack of asymmetry of the\ntwo lines that there is no obvious indication of the presence of twinning in our crystal. Quantitatively we find\nby adding an admixture of the twinned spectrum that to\nwithin our S/N, there could be a maximum of ten percent twinning present in our sample. This is consistent\nwith our XRD measurements discussed above.\n\n\f8\nTABLE III: Calculated lattice EFG values, Vlat in units of\nMHz, based on the point charge model.\nsite\nVlat\nVlat\nVlat\n\u03b7 lat EFG-PA (1-R)Vval\naa\ncc\nzz\nbb\nCu(2F) -1.140 -1.094 2.232 0.020\nc\n-71.62\nCu(2E) -1.204 -1.078 2.282 0.055\nc\n-69.43\nCu(1F) 4.182 -1.791 -2.391 0.143\na\n-96.55\nCu(1E) 2.338 2.476 -4.814 0.029\nc\n-2.25\n\nFIG. 7: 63 Cu NMR spectrum at 60 K and 75.75 MHz for\nH0 ||a and b. The spectra are normalized to the integrated\nintensity of Cu(2E) line. Note that the feature on the right\nside of Cu(2F) for H0 ||a is due to the imperfect subtraction\nof Cu(1E) signal. This of course does not affect the Cu(2E)\nlineshape.\n\nC.\n\nCharge Transfer and Oxygen Ordering\n\nOxygen ordering in the chain layer may have an effect\non charge transfer to the planes. We now investigate this\npossibility through the planar copper EFG values. Considering the intinerant holes in the CuO2 planes, \u03bdQ for\nthe two sites Cu(2E) and Cu(2F) in these planes might\nbe expected to be the same. However, we have observed\na splitting of the Cu(2) resonance. The coupling of the\nnuclei's quadrupole moment with its environment determines \u03bdQ which is directly proportional to the electric\nfield gradient at the nucleus. The local EFGs reflect the\nstructural and crystallographic aspects of the compound\nand provide information about ionicity and bonding. The\nEFG at the nuclear site is determined by two contributions: one arising from the charges on the neighboring\nlat\nions (lattice contribution) Vzz\nand the second arising\nfrom the incomplete electronic shells (valence contribuval\ntion) Vzz\nof the ion under consideration. The total EFG\nmay be written as[41]\nlat\nval\nVzz = (1 \u2212 \u03b3\u221e )Vzz\n+ (1 \u2212 R)Vzz\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere \u03b3\u221e and R are the anitishielding factors which account for the antishielding effect of the core electrons of\nthe central ion on the lattice and valence contributions,\nrespectively. From this equation, if one calculates the\nlattice contribution, one can obtain the valence contribution from the data. To what extent does the Cu(2)\nsplitting stem from chain ordering in the Ortho\u2013II structure (lattice contribution) or from differing charge transfer (valence contribution)? To address this question, we\nhave used the point charge model (PCM) to calculate the\n\nlattice contributions to the observed EFG values for the\nfour Cu sites in Ortho\u2013II structure. Although the PCM\nis simplistic we are interested only in relative differences\nand not the absolute values of EFG parameters.\nApplying the formal valence description to Ortho\u2013II\n+2 \u22122\nYBCO results in Y+3 Ba+2\n2 Cu3 O6.5 ionic configuration.\nHowever this neglects the fact that Cu(1E) is in the 3d10\nstate with charge +1. The resulting extra hole is taken\nto be distributed over the CuO2 planes. We have taken\nthe planar Cu sites to have a valence of +2.083, the planar O sites a valence of -1.917, the Cu sites in the full\nchain a valence of +2, the Cu in the empty chain a valence of +1, the rest of the oxygens a valence of -2 and\nBa and Y in +2 and +3, respectively. We have used\nthe atomic positions obtained[42] by single crystal X-ray\ndiffraction measurements at 80 K. It should be noticed\nthat due to the alternating nature of the full and empty\nchains, some atomic displacements are observed[42] from\nthe mean position of atoms, most notably Ba. This is\nattributed to the lattice tendency to minimize its electrostatic energy[43]. We have summed to convergence over\nthe contributions within a crystal containing \u00b150, \u00b1100\nand \u00b130 unit cells along the a, b, and c\u2013axes, respectively. The resulting values for the principal components\nof EFG for all sites are given in Table III. The (1-R)Vval\nzz\nvalues are obtained using eq. 3.2, the experimental values of \u03bdQ and \u03b3\u221e [44] for Cu+2 =-17.4 and Cu+1 =-5.2 in\na crystalline environment.\nThe calculated values produce the correct EFG principal axes. Furthermore, small values of the asymmetry\nparameters for Cu(2F/E) indicate a small deviation of\nthese sites from tetragonal symmetry in accordance with\nour experimental results. The directions of the principal\naxes and the values of \u03b7 are not expected to be affected\nso much by the electronic structure of the subject ion\nsince this effect is isotropic to first order. This explains\nthe success of the point charge model in predicting the\nprincipal axes and \u03b7 values. A larger value of \u03b7 lat is obtained for the Cu(1F) site. This value is not as large as\nthe observed one since it does not contain the asymmetric\nligand contribution.\nSince the Cu(2F/E) and Cu(1F) sites have +2 valence, one would expect[45] a valence contribution, (19\nR)Vval\nzz \u2248 \u221270 MHz, to the EFG from a hole in the 3d\n10\nstate and a zero contribution for Cu(1E) sites in the 3d\nstate. Our values obtained for this contribution to the\nEFG for Cu(1E) site is small and supports this charge\n\n\f9\nconfiguration for this site. We find a difference in valence contribution of 2.19 MHz between the Cu(2F) and\nCu(2E) sites. Comparing this value to the experimentally\nobserved 3.15 MHz, we conclude that the valence (local moment) contribution to the EFG difference at these\nsites is dominant. This can be understood as resulting\nfrom a different charge transfer for these two sites; the\nfull chains act as the charge reservoir whereas the empty\nchains do not. Charge transfered from the full chains resides at both the Cu(2F) and Cu(2E) sites but with a\nlarger amount at Cu(2F), the site closer to the full chain.\nThe inadequacy of the point charge model is apparent for\nthe Cu(1F) site not only in its prediction of the asymmetry parameter but also in the valence contribution[46].\nIn this case asymmetric ligand effects are mostly responsible.\nTo investigate the effects of the domain walls on the\nEFG values, we have introduced different types of domain walls and then calculated the EFG parameters for\ndifferent sites. This calculation shows that the domain\nboundaries affect the Cu(1F/E) sites the most and the\nCu(2F/E) sites the least. Our results also show that the\nbulk values of the lattice contribution to \u03bdQ are essentially recovered just one lattice constant away from the\ndomain walls.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nLine assignments for YBCO6.5 have been made. The\nlack of an observable NMR signal from the chain ends\nat the domain walls confirms the long chain lengths suggested by X\u2013ray diffraction. We place a lower limit on\nthe chain length of 50 lattice constants. Consistent with\nthis is the narrow linewidths comparable to those of the\nbest YBCO7 crystals. This is a result of little oxygen\ndisorder in these crystals.\nThus these crystals are a much better realization of\n\n\u03bd\n\n(2)\n\n2\n\u03bdQ\n=\n\u03b3n H0 (1 + K)\n\n2\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank J.P. Castellane and B. Gaulin\nfor performing the single crystal X\u2013ray diffraction measurements on our crystals.

In addition,\nas mentioned above, the long chains appear to support\nFriedel\u2013like oscillations nucleated at the chain ends[32].\nAnother consequence of oxygen ordering in the chain\nlayer is the effect it has on the CuO2 planes via charge\ntransfer. This is manifested in the Cu(2E/F) splitting.\nOur analysis concludes that most of this splitting is due\nto differential charge transfer from the chains.\nFinally, previous reports of static moments in\nYBCO6.5 are inconsistent with our results.\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\nK = Kx sin \u03b8cos \u03c6+Ky sin \u03b8sin \u03c6+Kz cos \u03b8 (A.5)\nand \u03b8 and \u03c6 are the polar angles of the applied magnetic\nfield with respect to the principal axis frame which is\n\n(A.4)\n\nassumed to be the same for both the Knight shift tensor\nand EFG tensor. \u03b3n is the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio\nand H0 is the applied magnetic filed. \u03b7 is the asymmetry\nV \u2212V\nparameter, defined as \u03b7 = xxVzz yy , where |Vxx | \u2264 |Vyy | \u2264\n\n\f10\n|Vzz | are the principal components of the electric field\ngradient (EFG) tensor at the Cu site and \u03bdQ = eQVzz /h,\ne the elementary electric charge, and Q is the electric\n\nquadrupole moment of the nucleus under study.
