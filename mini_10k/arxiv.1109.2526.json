In order to reduce their high AC loss, it is necessary to understand the loss mechanisms. In this article, we measure and simulate\nthe AC loss and the critical current, Ic , in stacks of pancake coils (\"pancakes\"). We construct stacks of up to 4 pancakes and we measure them\nby electrical means. We also obtain the anisotropic field dependence of\nJc from Ic measurements of the tape. This Jc is the only input to the\nsimulations, together with the coil dimensions. After validating our computations with the measurements, we simulate stacks of many pancakes,\nup to 32. We found that the AC loss in a stack of (four) pancakes is very\nhigh, two orders of magnitude larger than for a single tape. A double\npancake behaves as a single one with double width but a stack of more\npancakes is very different. Finally, we found that a 2-strand Roebel cable\nreduces the AC loss in a stack of pancakes but not in a single pancake.\nIn conclusion, our simulations are useful to predict the ac loss of stacks\nof coated conductor pancake coils and to reduce the ac loss by optimizing\nthe coil design.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nReBa2 Cu3 O7\u2212x (or ReBCO) coated conductors (where Re is a rare earth, usually Y, Gd or Sm) are the most promising high-temperature superconductors\nfor applications because of two reasons: their high operation temperature, up to\nliquid nitrogen, and their good in-field performance. Many power applications\ncontain windings, consisting on either solenoids or stacks of pancake coils. The\nlatter is usually more convenient for winding technology because of the tape\ngeometry of the coated conductors. Applications containing these windings are\neither AC (transformers, motors and generators, including wind generators) or\nDC (high-field magnets, superconducting magnetic storage systems). The AC\nloss in present AC devices is too high, specially for transformers [1, 2] and\nthe stator of rotating machines. Although using DC superconducting coils in\nthe rotor already provides many advantages for superconducting rotating machines [3], superconducting stators with sufficiently low AC loss further increase\n1\n\n\fthe efficiency and power per unit weight in all-superconducting motors [4]. In\naddition, using superconducting windings in the stator only, with permanent\nmagnets in the rotor, requires a much simpler cryogenic system [5, 6]. Actually,\nthe DC winding of the rotor is under the influence of a certain ripple magnetic\nfield from the stator; that is, a small AC field on a DC background. This may\ncause significant AC loss, which should be taken into account in the cryogenic\ndesign. Reduction of AC loss in DC devices is also desirable because it limits\nthe ramp speed. Moreover, hysteresis loss is often not negligible, specially for\nliquid-helium cooled systems. In order to reduce the AC loss, it is necessary\nto understand the loss mechanisms. In addition, measurements are required to\ncharacterise the windings and simulation tools are needed to predict the AC\nloss and design the cryogenic system. However, there is very little work on\nstacks of ReBCO pancake coils and, particularly, no work at all on AC loss\nsimulations. Actually, detailed AC loss simulations are also missing for stacks\nof pancakes made of Bi2 Sr2 Ca2 Cu3 O10 (Bi2223) tapes (the previous generation\nof high-temperature superconducting tapes), in contrast to the extensive experimental work [7, 8, 9, 10]. In addition, there are no published simulations using\na realistic anisotropic field dependence for the critical current density, Jc .\nThere are practically no AC loss measurements for stacks of pancake coils.\nMost of the work is for single pancake coils, both for coated conductors with\nferromagnetic substrate [11, 12, 13] and non-magnetic one [14, 15], or double\npancakes with ferromagnetic substrate [16, 17]. The only measurements for a\nstack of pancake coils is [18], where they use coated conductor with ferromagnetic substrate. The mechanisms of the AC loss in that work are not clear,\npresumably dominated by the ferromagnetic or eddy current contributions at\nlow AC amplitudes. Other articles on stacks of pancakes measure only the\ncritical current [19, 20].\nThere are no AC loss simulations on stacks of pancake coils beyond a double\npancake. There is, however, an extensive work on pancake coils made of coated\nconductor with both non-magnetic substrate [14, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25] or magnetic\none [17]. In addition, [26, 17] calculate the AC loss in double pancakes ([26]\ndiscusses a Roebel cable but all the results are identical to those for a double\npancake with the same cross-sectional structure as the cable). The only work\non stacks of pancake coils predicts the critical current and the magnetic field\nbut not the AC loss [27]. The most relevant works comparing the simulations\nwith experiments are [28, 29], about single pancakes.\nCircular pancake coils and stacks of them are usually applied to transformers and high-field magnets. Concerning motors and generators, most prototypes\ncontain racetrack coils [3]. However, the AC loss in circular coils and parallel\nstacks of strips are of the same order of magnitude, presenting the same qualitative features [30]. Since racetrack coils contain circular and straight parts,\nthey present the same qualitative behaviour as circular coils. Then, the results\nfor circular coils are also useful to understand the loss mechanisms in racetrack\ncoils and interpret the measurements.\nIn this article, we measure (in liquid nitrogen bath) and numerically simulate\nthe AC loss and critical current in pancake coils and stacks of them made of\ncoated conductor with non-magnetic substrate. For all cases, the coils are in\nself-field; that is, there is no magnetic field created by external sources. First,\nwe measure stacks consisting on 1, 2, 3 and 4 pancakes practically identical\nto each other. Afterwards, we simulate these stacks and check the validity of\n2\n\n\fFigure 1: The mechanical structure made of epoxy-fiberglass (or fiberglass) avoids\nvibrations and ensures mechanical stability for both the single pancakes (a,b) and the\nstacks of pancakes (c) in the experiments.\n\nthe simulations by comparing to the measurements. The only input to the\nsimulations are the coil dimensions and the anisotropic field dependence of the\ncritical current density, Jc . We obtain this dependence from critical-current\nmeasurements of a tape sample. Finally, we simulate situations difficult to\nconstruct. These are the effects of stacking many pancakes, up to 32, and the\nreduction of the AC loss by replacing the single tape by a 2-strand Roebel cable.\nThis article is structured as follows. Section 2 details the experimental\nmethod and presents the measured critical current and AC loss of the 4 individual pancakes and stacks made of them. That section also presents the\nanisotropic field dependence of the critical current of the tape. Section 3 describes the simulation technique and discusses the results for the magnetic field,\ncurrent distribution, critical current and AC loss, discerning the contribution\nfrom each pancake of the stack. In that section, we further discuss the experiments in light of the simulations of the experiments and other configurations\nwhich are difficult to measure. Finally, section 4 summarises our conclusions.\n\n2\n\nMeasurements\n\nIn the following, we present the measurements. First, we outline the experimental method, consisting entirely on electrical means, and the technique to\nconstruct the stacks of pancake coils (section 2.1). Afterwards, we present and\ndiscuss the results for the field dependence and the anisotropy of the critical\ncurrent of the tape (section 2.2), the critical current of the coils (section 2.3)\nand the AC loss (section 2.4).\n\n2.1\n\nExperimental method\n\nThe pancakes are wound with YBCO coated conductor (CC) tape of width 4.0\nmm and self-field critical current Ic = 128 A for a straigh tape at 77 K (tape\nSCS4050 delivered by SuperPower Inc. [31]). Before winding, we insulate the\nCC tape by means of one layer of Kapton tape of thickness 70 \u03bcm, placing it on\nthe substrate side of the CC tape. The insulated CC tape is then wound on a\nfiberglass ring with the YBCO layer oriented inward. After winding, the turns\nof the pancake are fixed with another fiberglass ring surrounding the pancake\n(figure 1). Table 1 lists the basic characteristics of one pancake. The pancakes\nare assembled to a stack using auxiliary sticks made of thin copper. These sticks\nare introduced in holes drilled to the fiberglass rings in the direction parallel to\n3\n\n\fTable 1: Dimensions of the coils.\nIndividual pancakes\nInner diameter\nOuter diameter\nNumber of turns\nTape length\nStacks of pancakes\nInsulation thickness between pancakes\nStack height for:\n2 pancakes\n3 pancakes\n4 pancakes\n\n60 mm\n67.8 mm\n24\n4.9 m\n0.3 mm\n8.9 mm\n13.1 mm\n17.6 mm\n\nthe coil axis, crossing the whole pancake height. This ensures a fixed position\nof the pancakes during the manipulation with the stack. The pancakes are\ninsulated from each other by a thin fiberglass foil. The preparation of the stack is\ncompleted by pressing the pancakes. We do this by placing two fiberglass plates\non the top and bottom of the stack and tightening them by a non-metallic screw\n(figure 1). Basic properties of the stack are listed in table 1. The pancakes in\nthe stack are electrically connected by soldering their appropriate ends with the\nsuperconducting layer face-to-face. We soldered two different kinds of voltage\ntaps, with its corresponding wiring. The first kind are voltage taps at the ends\nof the coil to measure the whole coil signal. The second ones, are voltage taps\nat the connections between pancakes of the stack to measure the voltage drop\nat the connections. All these connections are soldered at around 10 mm from\nthe coil terminals or the connections between pancakes to ensure a good current\ntransfer to the superconducting layer.\nWe performed the following electrical characterisation of the pancakes and\nstacks:\n1. Ic was measured for every single pancake (labelled as P1, P2, P3 and\nP4) using the standard 4-probe method. This monitors the voltage drop\nacross the whole tape length. As criterion for Ic determination, we chose\n0.1 \u03bcV/cm instead of the more usual 1 \u03bcV/cm to decrease the possibility\nof pancake damage.\n2. The AC loss was measured for every single pancake using the lock-in\nmethod at two frequencies: 23 and 36 Hz. The voltage signal is taken\nfrom the taps at the terminals. The transport AC current is measured\nby a Rogowski coil. We also use this voltage (shifted 90o with respect\nto the transport current) to compensate the huge inductive component\nof the measured voltage of the pancake. We set the desired value of this\ncompensation signal by means of a Dewetron DAQP Bridge-B amplifier.\n3. Afterwards, we assembled a double pancake (labelled as S2) consisting\nof pancakes P1 and P2. For these pancakes, we measured the critical\ncurrent Ic of the individual pancakes forming the stack. For this purpose,\nwe used the appropriate combination of wiring from the voltage taps at\nat the terminals of the stack and those to monitor the voltage drop at the\nconnections between pancakes.\n\n4\n\n\f4. We measured the total AC loss of the double pancake (loss of two assembled pancakes plus dissipation on the soldered contact) using the same\napproach like in point (ii). The contribution of the soldered contact was\nalso registered for comparison to the total loss.\n5. The points (iii) and (iv) were repeated for stacks of pancakes consisting\nof pancakes P1, P2 and P3 (stack labelled as S3) and all four pancakes\n(stack labelled as S4).\nOur simulations (section 3) require measurements of the DC properties of\nthe tape used for the pancake preparation. These measurements are the Ic\nanisotropy in dependence on DC applied magnetic field BDC up to 200 mT and\non its direction to the sample surface expressed by angle \u03b8 (sketch in figure\n2). For Ic determination, we took the criterion of 1 \u03bcV/cm. The measuring\ntechnique is detailed in [32].\n\n2.2\n\nIc anisotropy and field dependence of the coated conductor\n\nFigure 2a shows Ic of a short sample as a function of the orientation of the applied DC magnetic field \u03b8. The field is oriented perpendicularly to the sample\nwide surface at position \u03b8 = 0o (figure 2b). At position \u03b8 = 90o the vector product J\u00d7BDC is directed towards the sample surface and at \u03b8 = 270o it is directed\ntowards the YBCO layer-substrate interface. Therefore, the difference between\nthe maxima at \u03b8 = 90o and \u03b8 = 270o can be explained by a stronger surface barrier on the superconductor-air interface 1 than on the superconductor-substrate\none [33]. The maximum Ic is not exactly at \u03b8 = 90o and \u03b8 = 270o . A similar\nbehaviour was found also in [34, 35] and explained by the presence of additional\npinning centres, which was confirmed by SEM analysis. The misalignment of\nthe YBCO layer with the surface also contributes to this shift of the peaks.\nThese irregularities could influence the AC loss of YBCO pancake stacks. For\nsimulation, this influence is taken into account and the Ic (BDC ) dependence at\ndifferent \u03b8 is measured and fitted (figure 2b). We discuss more details on the\nanisotropy in section 3.2.\nIn order to estimate the critical current of the coils for voltage criteria different than that used for the critical current of the tape (1\u03bcV/cm), we measured\nthe current-voltage characteristics, I(V ), of the tape at several applied fields\nand two orientations, 0o and 90o . These characteristics present a power-law dependence for all the measured voltage range, from 0.5 to 32.5 \u03bcV/cm. Figure 3\nshows the flux-creep exponent, n, of this dependence [I(V ) = Vc (I/Ic )n , where\nVc is the voltage-per-length criterion for Ic ]. The n exponent decreases with the\napplied field and it is different for both measured orientations. For perpendicular applied fields, n is the lowest and it saturates for large applied fields to a\nrelatively large value, 18.3. For parallel applied fields with large enough magnitudes (above 72 mT), the exponent fits well to n(B, \u03b8 = 90o ) = (B0n /B)1/4\nwith B0n = 1.00 * 105 T.\n1 This\n\ninterface is afterwards covered with a cap stabilisation layer.\n\n5\n\n\fFigure 2: The (black) chain lines in both graphs are directly calculated from the fit of\nJc , equations (1)-(7), therefore that line represents the critical current if the self-field\nwould not be present. The simulations, (red) solid lines, use the same Jc but taking\ninto account the self-field. (a) The anisotropy of the critical current does not follow a\n180o periodicity in the orientation angle \u03b8 [the sketch in (b) shows the \u03b8 definition].\n(b) The plateau at low applied fields is caused by the self-field.\n\n6\n\n\fFigure 3: Measured flux-creep exponent, n, from the power-law current-voltage relation of the tape, I(V ) = Vc (I/Ic )n . In order to extrapolate to large fields, we can\nassume that n saturates for \u03b8 = 0o (black dash line), while for \u03b8 = 90o it fits to\nn = (B0n /B)1/4 with B0n = 1.00 * 105 T (continuous black line).\n\n2.3\n\nCritical current of the coils\n\nWe measured the critical currents of the pancakes, both as a standalone coil and\nforming part of the stacks (tables 2 and 3). The critical current of the pancakes\nforming a stack provide information on the critical current of the complete stack.\nThis is because the critical current of the stack is dominated by the pancake\nwith the lowest critical current. Moreover, by measuring only the global critical\ncurrent of the stack we could damage the weakest pancake, where the voltage\ndrop of all the coil is concentrated.\nThere is a very low spread of the critical current of the individual pancakes\n(0.9A), confirming the homogeneity of the YBCO tape (table 2). The critical\ncurrents of pancakes P1 and P2 forming stack S2 decrease roughly 3 A and\nare again comparable to each other. A different situation is observed for stack\nS3. Ic for pancake P3 (placed at the top of stack) in S3 decreases to 54 A. At\ncurrent I = 55.1 A, the voltage measured on P3 reaches 500 \u03bcV/cm, whereas\nthe voltage measured on P1 and P2 remains at the background level. To avoid\ndestroying P3, we did not further increase the current, concluding that Ic for\nP1 and P2 is larger than 55.1 A (table 3). For the stack S4, the critical current\nwas measured for P1 and P4 (pancakes placed on top and bottom of stack),\nassuming that their critical current is lower comparing to the inner pancakes.\nThis is justified because the magnetic field in the external pancakes is larger\nthan in the inner ones. Moreover, simulations show that the pancakes with the\nlowest critical current are the top and bottom ones (section 3.4). Surprisingly,\nP1 and P4 in S4 had higher Ic , 57.4 A, than P3 in stack S3 (table 3). A possible\nexplanation is an inhomogeneity of Jc along the tape length that appears at\nrelatively large magnetic fields, around 200 \u03bcT. In order to check that pancake\n7\n\n\fTable 2: Critical current of the individual pancakes.\npancake label\nIc [A]\n\nP1\n68.5\n\nP2\n68.0\n\nP3\n68.3\n\nP4\n67.6\n\nTable 3: Critical current of each pancake within the stacks S2, S3 and S4 made of 2,\n3 and 4 pancakes, respectively.

In general, the critical current of the coils decreases with\nthe number of pancakes because the local self-field increases.\nStack S3 (or the weakest pancake in stack S3) has around 10% lower critical\ncurrent comparing to the interpolation line between the values for stack S2 and\nS4 (figure 14). This 10% difference can be attributed to the non-homogeneity\nin the tape length. Actually, the homogeneity of the tape in reel-to-reel tests\nis usually based on critical current measurements in self-field. Then, it is not\nsurprising that the in-field critical current of the tape has a larger variation\nthan the rated 5% from the producer. This larger variation of the in-field\ncritical current will inevitably appear in coils made of state-of-the-art tapes,\nand thence it has to be taken into account in the coil design.\n\n2.4\n\nAC loss\n\nThe measured resistance of the soldered contacts between pancakes P1P2, P2P3\nand P3P4 were 10.9, 8.8 and 5.7 \u03bc\u03a9, respectively. The influence of these contacts\non the total power AC loss of the stacks of pancakes is negligible. As illustration,\nfigure 4 shows the dissipation on the contacts between pancakes P1, P2 and P2,\nP3 together with the total one of stack S3, both before and after subtracting\nthe dissipation on the contacts. The contribution from the soldered contacts is\nonly visible at the lowest transport current.\nAfter removing the contacts contribution, the AC loss per cycle and unit tape\nlength presents the following features (see figure 5 for the current frequencies\n23 and 36 Hz). The AC loss2 for all the individual pancakes is the same within\n2 In order to avoid repetition, we refer to the AC loss per cycle by simply \"AC loss\". With\nthe exception of figure 4, all the results in this article are for the AC loss per cycle and unit\n\n8\n\n\fFigure 4: Measured power AC loss of the 3-pancake stack, S3, before (open circles)\nand after (full circles) correcting the contribution of the soldered connections. This\ncontribution is much smaller the total loss (crosses and asterisks are for the connections between pancakes P1,P2 and P2,P3, respectively) because of the relatively low\nconnection resistance (labels in the graph).\n\nFigure 5: The measured AC loss per cycle and unit tape length for two frequencies,\n36 and 23 Hz, shows that the AC loss in the coils is of hysteresis nature. The AC\nloss per tape length in the stacks of 2, 3 and 4 pancakes (S2, S3, S4) is larger than\nthat for the individual pancakes (only pancakes P3 and P4 from table 2 are shown)\nand around 2 orders of magnitude larger than a single tape, represented by the Norris'\nstrip formula [36].\n\n9\n\n\fthe measurement accuracy (for simplicity, figure 5 shows the results for P3 and\nP4 but not P1 and P2). It presents no frequency dependence, confirming the\npure hysteresis nature assumed in the simulations. The AC loss per tape length\nincreases with increasing the number of pancakes. This means that the stack\nhas higher AC loss than the sum of the ac loss in its pancakes when forming\na standalone coil. In particular, the AC loss per tape length is around 3 and\n4 times larger than that of a single pancake for the 2- and 4-pancake stacks,\nrespectively. Moreover, the AC loss per tape length for the 4-pancake stack is\naround two orders of magnitude larger than for a single tape. This loss is much\nlarger than for the two AC applications closest to commercialisation, power\ntransmission cables and resistive fault-current limiters, where the AC loss per\ntape length is below that of one tape. In order to compare the results with\nusual desired values in transformers, we take the requirement of the AC loss per\nunit tape length in [37] for a 25 MVA self-limiting transformer: 44 mW/m. The\nAC loss per unit tape length in the measured 4-pancake stack is around 400\nmW/m at a current amplitude of 85% of the critical current (49 A) and 50 Hz\nof frequency. This suggests that the AC loss in close-packed stacks of pancake\ncoils, like in the experiment, will be too high for many transformer designs.\n\n3\n\nSimulations and comparison to experiments\n\nSimulations can only be useful for the design of a coil if they provide a reliable\nprediction before constructing the coil, not only an interpretation of the measurements after building the coil. The simulations in this section achieve this\ngoal, regarding the electrical properties. For this, it is necessary to first know\nthe magnetic field and angular dependence of Jc , Jc (B, \u03b8), of the coated conductor and the coil dimensions. Below, we first present the simulation technique\n(section 3.1), then we extract the field and angular dependence of Jc for the\ncoated conductor (section 3.2) and finally we present the results: the magnetic\nfield and current distribution (section 3.3), the coils critical current (section 3.4)\nand the AC loss (section 3.5). In that section, we also discuss the effect on the\nAC loss by adding more pancakes to our stack and the AC loss reduction by a\n2-strand Roebel cable.\n\n3.1\n\nSimulation technique\n\nFirst, we extract the field, B, and angle, \u03b8, dependence of the internal Jc of\nthe coated conductor from the measurements of the critical current, Ic , as a\nfunction of the applied field and its orientation (figure 2). This extraction is\nnot straightforward because the self-field of the tape influences the local B\nand \u03b8, and thence Jc . We obtain Jc (B, \u03b8) from Ic measurements with the\nmethod we presented in [32]. Outlining, we developed a computer program that\ncalculates the critical current of a tape, given a certain Jc (B, \u03b8) function. This\nprogram is based on the self-consistency of the critical current density and the\nlocal magnetic field, taking into account that the current distribution creates\nmagnetic field. With this program, we fit the parameters of a function for\nJc (B, \u03b8) in such a way that the measured in-field anisotropy of Ic agrees the\nbest with the computations. The choice of the function of Jc (B, \u03b8) is based on\ntape length.\n\n10\n\n\fphysical arguments. For a single tape with a field-dependent Jc , it is not possible\nto assume that the electromagnetic quantities are uniform across the thickness.\nThis is because (i) the parallel magnetic field influences Jc and (ii) the parallel\nmagnetic field is antisymmetric with respect to the tape thickness, so the average\nin the thickness vanish but not its local value. Indeed, the parallel field at the\ntape surface is of the same order of magnitude as the perpendicular magnetic\nfield. For the computations, we divide the cross-section of the superconducting\nlayer (1.4 \u03bcm \u00d7 3.96 mm) in 17\u00d7170 rectangles with uniform Jc . In the rest of\nthe article we refer to the superconducting layers as simply \"tapes\".\nOnce the Jc (B, \u03b8) dependence is known, we calculate the AC loss by means\nof the Minimum Magnetic Energy Variation (MMEV) method. The MMEV\nmethod assumes the sharp E(J) relation of the critical-state model, where E is\nthe electrical field. It is based on, first, a variational principle proposed by L.\nPrigozhin [38], which finds the current distribution by minimising the magnetic\nenergy variation, and, second, a fast non-standard minimisation routine. This\nroutine has been developed incrementally in several articles. Initially, Sanchez\nand Navau solved a cylinder in an applied magnetic field under certain restrictions [39]. Later on, Pardo et al. developed the general method for tapes under\nany combination of applied magnetic field and transport current [40]. The latest stage of the method is published in [41, 13], where [41] and [13] take into\naccount the field dependence of Jc and the interaction with linear magnetic\nmaterials, respectively. Independently, L. Prigozhin and V. Sokolovsky applied\nthe variational principle in [38] to solve single pancake coils by more standard\nminimisation techniques [25]. The MMEV method is also useful to calculate\nthe critical current of superconducting coils [41, 32]. The main advantage of\nMMEV compared to conventional Finite-Element Methods is its speed [26] and\nlow RAM memory. Thanks to this, it is possible to calculate the AC loss in\ncoils made of many turns [23]. In this article, we report results for coils (in this\ncase stacks of pancake coils) with as many as 24 \u00d7 32 =768 turns (figure 17).\nThe MMEV method is also useful to calculate the critical current of the coils\nfor a certain Jc (B, \u03b8). The critical current is calculated by solving the current\ndistribution for an increasing transport current from the zero-field cooled state.\nThe calculation stops when there is at least one turn that is fully penetrated\nby critical current, corresponding to the coil critical current. The details of the\nMMEV method for a Jc (B, \u03b8) dependence can be found in [41].\nFor the coils, we assume that the electromagnetic quantities are uniform\nacross the tape thickness. This is a good approximation for pancake coils because the variation of the parallel component of the magnetic field across the\nthickness is much smaller than the average value, contrary to single tapes. In\nthis article, we use between 120 and 76 current elements across the width in\neach turn and one element in their thickness. We only use the lowest number\nof elements for coils with more than 100 turns.\nWe calculate the magnetic flux lines (figure 6) as level curves of rA [42],\nwhere r is the radius and A is the vector potential in the Coulomb's gauge. This\ngives the exact direction of the magnetic flux density (or magnetic field), B =\n\u03bc0 H. However, the separation of these level curves is not inversely proportional\nto B but to rB. For our case, the coils thickness is one order of magnitude\nsmaller than the average radius. Then, the separation between level curves of\nrA approximately describes the intensity of the local flux density.\nWe use the experimental tape and coil dimensions for the calculations. In\n11\n\n\fparticular, the dimensions of the superconducting layer of the tapes is 1.4 \u03bcm\n\u00d7 3.96 mm, the separation between the superconducting layers of neighbouring turns in the pancakes is 188 \u03bcm, their inner radius is 29.5 mm and the\nsuperconductor-to-superconductor gap between pancakes is 540, 573, 465 \u03bcm\nfor the 2-, 3- and 4-pancake stacks respectively. This gap is 465 \u03bcm for all the\nstacks of more than 4 pancakes and for all the stacks calculated in figure 17.\n\n3.2\n\nFormula for the anisotropic magnetic-field dependence\nof Jc\n\nNext, we present the formula for the anisotropic field dependence of the internal\ncritical current density, Jc . The critical current density for which the computed\ncritical current, Ic , (see section 3.1) fits the best to the measurements (figure 2)\nis\nJc (B, \u03b8, J)\n\n=\n\n[Jc,ab (B, \u03b8, J)m + Jc,c (B)m ]1/m\n\n(1)\n\nwith\nJc,ab (B, \u03b8, J)\n\nJc,c (B)\n\n=\n\n=\n\nJ0,ab\nh\n\n1+\n\nh\n\n1+\n\nBf (\u03b8,J)\nB0,ab\n\nJ0,c\nB\nB0,c\n\ni\u03b2ab ,\n\ni\u03b2c ,\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nand\nf (\u03b8, J) =\n\n=\n\nf0 (\u03b8)\n\n=\n\nf\u03c0 (\u03b8)\n\n\u001a\n\nf0 (\u03b8)\nf\u03c0 (\u03b8)\n\nif J sin \u03b8 > 0\n,\notherwise\n\nq\nu2 cos2 (\u03b8 + \u03b40 ) + sin2 (\u03b8 + \u03b40 ),\nq\n=\nu2 cos2 (\u03b8 + \u03b4\u03c0 ) + v 2 sin2 (\u03b8 + \u03b4\u03c0 ),\n\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\n\nwhere the parameters are m = 8, J0,ab = 2.53 * 1010 A/m2 , J0,c = 2.10 * 1010\nA/m2 , B0,ab = 414 mT, B0,c = 90 mT, \u03b2ab = 0.934, \u03b2c = 0.8, u = 5.5,\nv =1.2, \u03b40 =-2.5o and \u03b4\u03c0 =0.5o. The critical current density at zero local field is\nJc (B = 0) = 2.59 * 1010 A/m2 .\nThe critical current calculated with this formula agrees with the experiments\n(figure 2). The maximum deviation is around 5% at intermediate applied fields\n(between 20 and 100 mT), although the average deviation is below 4%. As\ndiscussed in [32, 43, 44], the local Jc at a zero local field is larger than the\naverage critical current density at zero applied field, that is at self-field (figure\n2b). However, for the tape in this article, this effect is less important than in\n[32].\nThe formula for Jc [equations (1)-(7)] is similar to that in [32]. In particular,\nJc has several contributions with a field dependence of the Kim type [45] and\nelliptical anisotropy. However, there are some differences with the formula in\n[32]. The most important features of the formula in this article are the following.\n\n12\n\n\fFirst, the sign of the current density, J, influences Jc through equation\n(5). This is in order to describe the surface barrier effect, responsible for the\ndifference in the height of the peaks close to the ab direction (90o and 180o in\nfigure 2) [33]. For our case, Jc is lower when the driving force is towards the\ninterface between the superconductor and the buffer layers, consistent with our\nmeasurements (figure 2) and those in [33].\nSecond, the anisotropic contribution, Jc,ab in equation (1), is due to isotropic\npinning of the elliptical anisotropic vortices. This is supported by: (i) the\nangular dependence is described by an elliptical function [equations (6),(7)] and\n(ii) the experimental anisotropy factor, u=5.5, is close to the mass anisotropy\nof YBCO, 5.3 [46, 47]. The deviation of the ab peak from the ab direction is\nbecause of the tilt in the ab planes [34, 35]. Moreover, close to the ab directions\nthe vortex should deform, resulting in a complicated 3D pinning scenario [47].\nPossible artificial pinning centres close to the ab direction further complicate the\npinning landscape [35]. The shift in the ab peaks close to 90o and 270o is different\nto each other: \u03b40 =-2.5o and \u03b4\u03c0 =0.5o . This difference could be explained by the\nexperimental error in setting the angle origin, around 1o .\nFinally, the isotropic contribution, Jc,c in equation (1), is due to anisotropic\npinning in the c direction caused by columnar defects, such as dislocations and\nnano-particle arrays. Indeed, an anisotropic pinning can result in an apparent\nisotropic contribution. This is because the angular dependence of the critical\ncurrent density associated to these defects has a wide peak around the c direction\n(0o and 180o ). Since in our case this contribution is only dominant at a small\nrange close to the c direction, an isotropic or anisotropic contribution results in\nbasically the same total Jc . We expect that a wide peak around the c direction\nwill appear in large applied fields, as in [34, 35, 48]. The lower decay exponent\n\u03b2 in the c direction supports this prediction.\n\n3.3\n\nField and current distribution\n\nIn this section, we first discuss the magnetic field lines (figure 6), the current\ndistribution (figures 7, 8 and 10) and the current density in the central turns,\nthat is the 12th turn from the inner radius, (figures 9 and 11).\nThe magnetic field is parallel to the tapes in a large portion of the coil, as\nexpected from single pancake coils [23] (figure 6). This is because the tapes\nshield the perpendicular component of the magnetic field created by the other\ntapes. Due to the vertical symmetry, this component of the magnetic field also\nvanishes at the central gap of the double pancake and the four-pancake coil (and\nany coil with an even number of pancakes). On the contrary, the perpendicular\ncomponent does not vanish at the other gaps, such as the top and bottom gaps\nof the four-pancake coil (figure 6). The region with zero perpendicular field\nshrinks with increasing the current until it becomes a single horizontal line at\nthe critical current.\nThe magnetic field lines and the current distribution show that a double\npancake coil roughly behaves as a single pancake with double width (figures\n6 and 9). This is because of the vertical symmetry of the coils and the fact\nthat the current can freely distribute accross the upper or lower half for a given\nradial position, as it is the case for a single pancake. However, the case of a\nfour-pancake coil is qualitatively different. The cause is the presence of current\ndensity with opposite sign to the net current at the top and bottom pancakes\n13\n\n\fFigure 6: Cross-section of the coils consisting of 1, 2 and 4 pancakes with the computed\nflux lines (black lines) at the peak of the AC cycle for 46.0 A of amplitude; see sections\n3.1 and 3.2 for the geometrical parameters and the Jc (B, \u03b8) dependence, respectively.\nThe scketch defines the axial and radial coordinates, z and r, respectively. The flux\nlines show that a double pancake mainly behaves as a single one with double width\nbut a stack of more pancakes, like 4, is very different. These flux lines are calculated\nas level curves of rA (section 3.1). All the graphs are at the same scale, including\nthe difference in rA between neighbouring flux lines. However, the thickness of the\nsuperconducting layer (light yellow lines) is exaggerated for visibility.\n\n14\n\n\fFigure 7: This cross-section shows the current distribution in a double pancake at\nthe peak of the AC cycle for 46.0 A of amplitude (same situation as figure 6). For\nbetter visualisation, the colour-graded lines representing the superconducting layer are\nshown with a larger thickness than the one used in the simulations. The represented\nquantity is actually the average current density over the thickness of the tapes.\n\n(see text below). In the following, we detail the main features of the magnetic\nfield and the current distribution.\nAt the peak of the AC current, the four-pancake stack presents current\ndensity with opposite sign from the transport current, which can only be due\nto magnetisation currents (figure 8). These currents with opposite sign do not\nappear in a double pancake (figure 7). The cause is the mirror symmetry with\nrespect to the horizontal mid-plane. In more detail, the magnetisation field is\nantisymmetric. For this situation, the maximum exclusion of the perpendicular\nfield in the superconducting volume for a given transport current is when current\ndensity with the same sign as the transport current accumulates at the top and\nbottom of the coil. This situation is similar to an slab with transport current.\nFor the 4-pancake stack, the current density cannot accumulate at the top and\nbottom of the whole coil because the net current in the tapes of the central\npancakes has to be the same as those in the top and bottom ones. The current\ntries to accumulate at the top and bottom of the whole coil, creating a large\nregion with positive current at the top and bottom coils, but there appears a\nnegative current density to keep the transport current at the given value (figure\n8). This negative current density contributes to the relatively large current\npenetration in the inner pancakes near to the side neighbouring the top and\n15\n\n\fFigure 8: This cross-section shows the presence of current density with opposite sign\nfrom the transport current at the top and bottom pancakes for the 4-pancake stack.\nThe calculated situation is at the peak of the AC cycle for 46.0 A of amplitude (same\nsituation as figure 6). For better visualisation, the colour-graded lines representing\nthe superconducting layer are shown with a larger thickness than the one used in the\nsimulations. The represented quantity is actually the average current density over the\nthickness of the tapes.\n\n16\n\n\fFigure 9: Computed current density in the central turns (12th turn counting from\nthe one at the inner radius) at the peak of the AC cycle for 46.0 A of amplitude (same\nsituation as figure 6). Uniform current distribution would result in 0.83*1010 A/m2 .\nThe vertical position, z, is defined in the caption of figure 6. The 3- and 4-pancake\nstacks present currents with opposite sign as the transport current but not the single\nand double pancakes. The represented quantity is actually the average current density\nover the thickness of the tapes.\n\n17\n\n\fbottom pancakes. The gap between these pancakes further contributes to the\ncurrent penetration.\nThe current distribution and magnetic flux lines for the sub-coil forming the\ncentral two pancakes of the 4-pancake stack are qualitatively similar to that of\na double pancake (figures 6-8). This is because for both cases the magnetic field\nis anti-symmetric and the current can freely distribute across the half-height of\nthe coil/sub-coil. The main difference is that for a double pancake the current\npenetration and perpendicular field at the top and bottom are larger. This\nis due to the fact that for 4 pancakes, the top and bottom pancakes create\na perpendicular magnetic field opposing to that from the central sub-coil. A\nsimilar situation appears when comparing the central pancake of a 3-pancake\nstack with a single pancake (only the current distribution at the central pancake\nis shown in figure 9).\nAs usual for coils and stacks of tapes, the current density in one pancake is\nqualitatively the same for all the turns of the same pancake, except at the inner\nand outer radius of the coil [49, 23] (see figure 8). Then, the properties of the\ncurrent density at the central turn are representative for the complete coil.\nIn the following, we discuss the details of the current density in the central\nturn (figures 9 and 11). Actually, the simulations calculate the average current\ndensity across the thickness of the tape.\nFirst, the average current density presents two sharp peaks in each tape\n(figures 9 and 11). These peaks separate the critical and sub-critical regions,\nas for thin strips [50]. The critical regions are those which the average current\ndensity, J, becomes the critical current density, Jc . The sub-critical ones are\nthose with |J| < Jc . The sharp peaks appear because, at the boundary between\nboth regions, the perpendicular field vanishes and Jc are maximum. Between\nthe peak and the tape boundary, the average current density decreases because\nthe perpendicular field increases (figure 6), decreasing Jc . The average current\ndensity is uniform in practically all the under-critical region. The cause of this\nis detailed in [26] and is due to the fact that the magnetic flux does not cross the\nunder-critical region and the separation between tapes is much smaller than the\ntapes width. This average current density times the tape thickness, Jd, equals\nto the difference in the parallel magnetic field between the surfaces of the tape.\nSecond, the situation of a double pancake is practically the same as a single\npancake with double width (figure 9). The only difference is the presence of the\nnarrow peaks next to the gap, evidencing a slight penetration of critical current\ndensity in that region.\nFinally, in a stack of many pancakes the under-critical region shrinks with\napproaching to the end of the coil, disappearing at the top pancake (see figure\n11 for 32 pancakes). The cause is the following. The perpendicular magnetic\nfield increases with approaching to the coil end. This creates magnetisation\ncurrents, including negative current density at the peak of the AC cycle. Then,\nthe region with positive critical current density has to expand in order to keep\nthe same net current. As a result, the under-critical region shrinks. Another\nissue is that the peak of the current density at the uppermost pancake is lower\nthan for the other pancakes. This is because there is no under-critical region,\nso the perpendicular field is non-zero, increasing B and decreasing Jc .\nFor the 32-pancake coil it is worth to present the current distribution in all\nthe turns at least for 3 of its pancakes: the central one, the top one and the\npancake at 3/4 heigh, that is the 8th pancake from the top (figure 10). Apart\n18\n\n\fFigure 10: These cross-sections show the current distribution in the pancakes at the\ntop, 3/4 height and central pancakes (1st, 8th and 16th pancakes from the top) for\na 32-pancake coil, respectively, from top to bottom. The situation is for the peak of\nthe AC cycle for 46.0 A of amplitude. See sections 3.1 and 3.2 for the geometrical\nparameters and the Jc (B, \u03b8) dependence, respectively. For better visualisation, the\ncolour-graded lines representing the superconducting layer are shown with a larger\nthickness than the one used in the simulations. The represented quantity is actually\nthe average current density over the thickness of the tapes.\n\n19\n\n\fFigure 11: Computed current density in the central tapes (12th tape from the inner\nradius) for a stack of 32 pancakes and 24 turns per pancake (only the upper half is\nshown). The situation is at the peak of the AC cycle for 46.0 A of amplitude (same\nsituation as figure 10). Uniform current distribution would result in 0.83*1010 A/m2 .\nThe under-critical region, including the plateau, shrinks with approaching to the end\nof the stack. The represented quantity is actually the average current density over the\nthickness of the tapes.\nfrom the features already visible for the central pancake (figure 11), figure 10\nshows that the penetration depth of the critical region is larger at the inner\nturns. The cause is that the parallel magnetic field at the inner turns is larger,\ndecreasing the critical current density so that it is necessary a larger penetration\ndepth to achieve the same transport current. The current density in the plateau\nof the under-critical region is the same for all the turns, except at the inner and\nouter turns. This is because this current density is proportional to the variation\nof the parallel magnetic field in the radial direction, which is constant for a long\ncoil. These effects are already visible for 4 pancakes but for 32 pancakes they\nare more pronounced.\n\n3.4\n\nCritical current of the coils\n\nThe simulations show that the turn that limits the most the critical current for\nthe double pancake is the innermost turn at the bottom of the coil (figure 12).\nThis is because the magnetic field is the largest there and the anisotropy of the\ntape is not very large (figure 2). This is in contrast to coils made of Bi2223\ntapes, where the limiting turn is at the average radius on the top and bottom\nends [51]. The reason is that Bi2223 tapes are highly anisotropic. In addition,\nthe critical current density in the YBCO tape is asymmetric, so the bottom\npancake has slightly smaller critical current than the top one.\nFor the stack of 4 pancakes, the turn that limits the most the critical current\nis the second turn from the inner radius at the bottom of the pancake (figure 13).\nThis is because there is a compromise between the magnitude of the magnetic\nfield (the largest field is at the inner radius) and its orientation (with increasing\nthe radius, the magnetic field becomes more perpendicular to the tape). In\ncontrast to 2 pancakes, for 4 pancakes the anisotropy has a certain small effect\nbecause the magnetic field is larger, and thence the anisotropy is more important\n(see figure 2).\nSimulations provide a good estimate of the critical current of the stack of\npancake coils (figure 14).

The grey area represents the error\ncommitted by extrapolating the calculations for 1\u03bcV/cm to to 0.1 \u03bcV/cm. See sections 2.3 and 3.4 for the measurements and simulations, respectively. The separation\nbetween pancakes for more than 4 pancakes is the same as for 4 pancakes.\nestimate the critical current. The main reason is the different voltage criterion\nfor the measurements of the critcal current for the coils and the tape: 0.1 and 1\n\u03bcV/cm, respectively. The simulations, based on Jc obtained from measurements\nwith a larger voltage criterion, predict a larger critical current. In order to\nestimate the critical current for 0.1 \u03bcV/cm, we use the measured n exponent of\nthe current-voltage curve of the tape (figure 3). This n exponent depends on\nthe magnetic field and its orientation. What we do is to calculate the upper and\nlower limit of Ic using the upper and lower n in the coils. Simulations at the\ncritical current for 1\u03bcV/cm show that the maximum magnetic field at the turn\nthat limits the critical current for 4 pancakes is 240 mT, while the minimum\none for a single pancake is 160 mT. Then the minimum n for all the measured\ncases is that for 240 mT at 90o and the maximum one is that for 160 mT at\n0o . Using the extrapolations from section 2.2, we find that n is between 18.3\nand 28.1. With these n values, the critical current for 0.1 \u03bcV/cm is 0.88 and\n0.92 times Ic at 1 \u03bcV/cm, respectively. The difference between both curves is\n4%, and thence the error in the average value by taking an approximated n\nis only 2%. The gray area in figure 14 represents the region between the two\nlimits. The mid value between these limits agrees well with the experiments.\nThe maximum and minimum differences are 6.4 and 0.9 % for 3 and 1 pancakes,\nrespectively.\nSimulations are useful to predict situations difficult to measure, such as the\neffect of adding many pancakes to the stack (figure 14). The critical current\ndecreases with increasing the number of pancakes until it saturates. This is be-\n\n23\n\n\fFigure 15: Simulations of the AC loss per cycle and unit tape length (solid red lines)\ntogether with the experiments (dash blue lines with symbols). The number of pancakes\nare 1,2,3,4 in the arrow direction.\ncause (i) the top and bottom coils limit the critical current and (ii) the magnetic\nfield there saturates with increasing the coil height.\n\n3.5\n\nAC loss calculations\n\nIn the following, we first validate the AC loss simulations by comparing to\nthe experiments and afterwards we compute situations which are difficult to\nmeasure. These are the AC loss in individual pancakes of a stack, the effect of\nadding more pancakes and the AC loss reduction by a 2-strand Roebel cable.\n3.5.1\n\nComparison with experiments\n\nSimulations agree well with experiments in most cases (figure 15). However, the\nsimulations overestimate AC loss, increasing the deviation with approaching to\nthe critical current. This is due to the sharp E(J) relation of the critical-state\nmodel [26, 52]. The best agreement is for one pancake. The maximum deviation\nfor current amplitudes below 0.7 times the critical current of the coils is 6% for\na single pancake, 15% for stacks of 2 and 3 pancakes and 25% for 4 pancakes.\nThe deviation for the largest number of pancakes could be due to the imperfect\nformula for Jc (B, \u03b8), see figure 2. Our formula fits experimental data up to 200\nmT but the local magnetic field in the 4-pancake coil is up to 250 mT. Then,\nthere could be some error in the extrapolation. For one pancake at currents\nbelow 0.5 times the critical current, the discrepancy with the measurements is\naround 3%. This agreement is compatible with that between the measured and\nsimulated critical current of the tape, figure 2. From that comparison, we infere\nthat the average deviation of the internal Jc is below 4%. A discrepancy of\nonly 3% in the AC loss can be explained by the inevitable experimental error in\n24\n\n\fFigure 16: Simulations show that the AC loss per cycle and unit tape length in each\npancake (or the AC loss per pancake) increases with approaching to the end of the\nstack. The current amplitude is 46.0 A for all cases.\n\nthe measurements of the AC loss and the tape critical current. Simulations for\ncurrent amplitudes above the critical current of the coil would require a model\nwith a smooth E(J) relation.\n3.5.2\n\nAC loss in each pancake of a stack\n\nIn contrast to global electrical measurements, simulations can determine the\nlocal AC loss. This is because we calculate the AC loss by the integration of\nJ * E, which is the local power dissipation.\nThe AC loss (or the AC loss per tape length) in the central pancake is the\nsmallest (figure 16). Actually, the AC loss in the central pancake for stacks of\n3 pancakes or more is smaller than when that pancake is alone. This is because\nfor stacks of pancakes the magnetic field at the centre is roughly parallel to the\ntapes, while for a single pancake there is an important perpendicular component\n(figure 6). The larger the number of pancakes, the lower the AC loss in the\ncentral ones. This is because for an infinitely long coil, the field is parallel to\nthe tapes. However, there will always be a small perpendicular component due\nto the gap between pancakes.\nFor 3 pancakes, the AC loss at the central pancake is smaller than the AC\nloss in the central pancakes for 4 pancakes, figure 16. This is because for 3\npancakes the maximum perpendicular field in the central one is smaller than for\n4 pancakes. In addition, the vertical symmetry of the coil causes that the critical\nregions for 3 pancakes penetrate from the top and bottom of the pancake while\nfor 4 pancakes they penetrate practically only from one side (see figure 9). As\na consequence, the distance of the penetration depth is smaller for 3 pancakes.\nFor 4 pancakes, both the penetration depth and the maximum magnetic field\nare larger, so the AC loss in the central tape is larger. In more detail, the\n25\n\n\fFigure 17: The computed AC loss per cycle and tape length presents a peak with\nincreasing the number of pancakes (solid red line with symbols), given a certain current\namplitude (46.0 A in this case). The dash black line represents a function inversely\nproportional to the number of pancakes.\n\npower AC loss is the integration of JE in the superconducting section. At the\nundercritical region, E = 0, and thence from the Faraday law it follows that\nE \u221d \u2212\u2202\u03a6/\u2202t, where \u03a6 is the flux between the undercritical region and the point\nwhere it is evaluated and t is the time. Since at the central turns for 4 pancakes,\nboth the maximum magnetic field and the penetration depth are larger than for\n3 pancakes, the flux is larger and so is the AC loss. This reasoning can be\nextended to any given odd number of pancakes and the following even number\nof pancakes.\nThe largest AC loss per tape length is at the pancakes on the ends (figure\n16). The reason is that the perpendicular magnetic field is the largest there\n(figure 6). The AC loss per tape length in those pancakes saturates for coils\nwith a large enough number of pancakes.\nThese results have implications in cryogenics. Most of the heat is generated\nat the ends of the coil, where it is the easiest to extract, either by a cryogenic\nfluid or by conduction cooling. Heat extraction at the inner pancakes is usually\nmore difficult. However, the heat generated there will be the smallest. Another\nadvantage of the fact that most of the AC loss is generated at the top and\nbottom of the coils is that it can be reduced by means of magnetic diverters\n[13, 53, 54, 55].\n3.5.3\n\nDependence on the number of pancakes\n\nAt a fixed current, the AC loss per unit tape length increases with increasing the\nnumber of pancakes until it reaches a maximum, decreasing for large number of\npancakes (figure 17). A decrease of a power -1 would mean that the total AC\nloss of the coil is saturated. The AC loss per unit tape length (or per pancake)\n26\n\n\ffor the highest number of pancakes still does not decrease as a power -1. This\nis because the height-to-diameter ratio of the coil is not very large (around 2)\nand the perpendicular component of the magnetic field is not negligible in most\nof the coil. For very large number of pancakes, the AC loss per unit tape length\nwill saturate at a value much smaller than the one for a single pancake. This is\nbecause the magnetic field far away from the ends will be practically parallel to\nthe tapes, although there will always be a perpendicular component due to the\ngaps between the pancakes.\nThe AC loss per unit tape length in a double pancake is around 3 times\nlarger than a single one (figure 17). This is smaller than the expected factor\n4 for thick pancakes with large radius and constant Jc . The latter factor is\nobtained as follows. For thick enough pancakes, the AC loss approaches to that\nof a slab with the same width, a, thickness, b, and engineering current density\n2\nJc,e [23]. The loss per length of the slab is Q = \u03bc0 b3 aJc,e\n(Im /Ic )3 /6, where Im\nis the current amplitude [36]. Then, for a coil with internal radius much larger\nthan its width and high number of turns, the AC loss per tape length is\nQ=\n\n\u03bc0 w3 d2 Jc2 (Im /Ic )3\n,\n6(d + h)\n\n(8)\n\nwhere w, d and the width and thickness of the superconducting layer, and h\nis the separation between superconducting layers of neighbouring turns. As a\nconsequence, doubling the width of the coil results in 8 times larger loss. A\ndouble pancake coil behaves as a single one with double width but it has double\nthe number turns. Then, the loss per tape length in a double pancake is 4 times\nlarger than a single one. For our case, placing two coils together increases less\nthe loss per length because the coil thickness-to-height aspect ratio decreases,\nso the local magnetic field increases in a lower proportion than placing together\ninfinitely thick pancakes.\n3.5.4\n\nCoils made of Roebel cable\n\nRoebel cables are promising in order to reduce the AC loss due applied magnetic\nfields [56, 57, 58]. These cables are made of transposed strands. Our experimental coils are made of 4 mm tapes. In this section, we study the case that\nthe Roebel cable is made from cutting 4 mm wide tapes, so the cable is made\nof two strands and the total width is the same as the original tape. Then, the\ncritical current of the cable is slightly smaller than the original tape because\nof the loss of superconducting material. We take the approximation that the\ntransposition length is much larger than the cable width. Then, the crossover\nsegments are much smaller than the longitudinal segments in the strands, and\nthus the AC loss per cable length is approximately that of the parallel segments.\nAs a consequence, we can use our mathematically 2D model [59, 26]. Since in\na Roebel cable with electrically isolated filaments the net current is the same\nin all strands, we can simulate a coil made of a 2-strand Roebel cable as a coil\nwith double number of pancakes. In order to simplify the calculations, we take\nthe same separation between pancakes as the gap between strands in the Roebel\ncable. For the simulations, we use the same dimensions as the measured pancake coils (table 1) and a separation between pancakes or gap between Roebel\nstrands of 200\u03bcm. We take the anisotropic field-dependent Jc from equations\n(1)-(7).\n27\n\n\fFigure 18: Simulations reveal that replacing the tape by a 2-strand Roebel cable of\nthe same width reduces the AC loss in stacks of pancakes but not in a single pancake\n(section 3.5.4). The plot shows the AC loss per cycle and tape/cable length. The\nRoebel cable decreases slightly the critical current.\nThe simulations show that a Roebel cable does not reduce the AC loss in a\nsingle pancake coil (figure 18). This is because the pancake with a Roebel cable\nbehaves like a double pancake of the same width as the original coil. Since\ndouble pancakes roughly behave as a single one with double width (figure 6),\nthe pancake with Roebel cable behaves as a single one. The critical current with\nRoebel cable is slightly lower, which should increase the AC loss. However, this\nloss increase is roughly compensated by the reduction due to the gap in between\nstrands [60].\nThe Roebel cable reduces the AC loss in stacks of pancakes for high currents (figure 18). This is because the penetration depth of the critical current\nis reduced. Close to the critical current, the loss decreases down to around 60%\nof the original one for both the 4-pancake and 8-pancake stacks. This is close\nto 50%, the expected maximum reduction for a Roebel cable in perpendicular applied field [59]. The Roebel cable slightly increases the AC loss at low\namplitudes because of the reduction of the critical current.\n\n4\n\nSummary and conclusion\n\nThis article provides a complete study of the electromagnetic properties of\nReBCO pancake coils and stacks of them by means of experiments and simulations. In particular, we have studied the AC loss, the critical current and the\nfield and current distribution. First, we have experimentally characterised the\ncoils by electrical means. Afterwards, we have numerically simulated them. In\norder to do this, we have obtained anisotropic field dependence of the internal\ncritical current density, Jc (B, \u03b8), from measurements of the critical current, Ic ,\n\n28\n\n\fof the tape. Actually, we have obtained an analytical fit for Jc (B, \u03b8) by comparing the measured and calculated Ic so the self-field effects in the measurements\nare taken into account. Both the calculated critical current and AC loss of the\ncoils agree with the measurements, specially the AC loss for a single pancake\ncoil. We have also numerically studied the main properties of stacks of many\npancake coils, up to 32. Finally, we have predicted the AC loss reduction in the\ncoils by replacing the tape by a 2-strand Roebel cable of the same width.\nThe measurements have revealed the following features. First, the hysteresis\nAC loss per unit tape length increases with the number of pancakes in the stack\nfrom 1 to 4. The contribution from the resistive contacts between pancakes is\nnegligible. The critical current of all the pancakes at self-field is roughly the\nsame. However, one of the pancakes (P3) exhibits around 10% lower critical\ncurrent when it is under the influence of the field created by the other pancakes.\nThis evidences non-homogeneity in the field dependence of Jc . In addition, Jc\nof the tape does not follow a 180o symmetry and has two clear contributions:\nisotropic pinning centres and columnar ones in the c direction.\nThe simulations of the magnetic field and current distribution have shown\nthat a double pancake roughly behaves as a single one with double width. For\nstacks of 3 or more pancakes, the situation is very different. These stacks of\npancakes present magnetisation currents; that is, currents with opposite sign\nto that of the net current for the peak of the AC cycle. With increasing the\nnumber of pancakes, both the critical current and AC loss saturate for a large\nenough number of pancakes. Indeed, the AC loss at the pancakes far away from\nthe coil ends is negligible, although it never vanishes because of the presence of\nthe gaps between pancakes.\nIn conclusion, the hysteresis loss in stacks of ReBCO pancake coils is very\nlarge. Our simulations are useful to predict the AC loss in pancake coils and\nstacks of them. The predictions for the local dissipation are valuable for the\ncryogenic design. Effective heat removal is specially important close to the coil\nends, where most of the heat is generated. A 2-strand Roebel cable is enough\nto reduce the AC loss in stacks of pancakes to 50-60% of the original one for\nhigh enough current amplitudes. However, this Roebel cable does not reduce\nthe AC loss for single pancake coils. As future work, we propose to measure and\nsimulate larger coils, coils made of multi-strand Roebel cable and optimisation\ncomputations for minimum AC loss or maximum generated field.\n\nAcknowledgement\nThis work was supported by the Structural Funds of the European Union\nthrough the Agency for the Structural Funds of the European Union from the\nMinistry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic under the contract number 26240220028.\n\nReferences\n[1] M.
