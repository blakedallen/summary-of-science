Introduction\nNowadays there are two crucial problems in particle physics: the search for the Higgs particle\nor more generally the unravelling of the mechanism of symmetry breaking and the nature of Dark\nMatter (DM). The Higgs particle, responsible for symmetry breaking, is the cornerstone of the\nStandard Model (SM) and of some of its extensions. As long as the Higgs particle escapes detection\nthere will be a missing link in our understanding of the nature of fundamental interactions and the\nSM will be incomplete. As concerns the nature of DM we are facing a different issue: there is\nrobust experimental evidence for DM, yet we have no additional evidence for the existence of a\nstable massive particle which can play the role of DM. For this we have to consider extensions of\nthe SM and assume an additional discrete unbroken symmetry, for example Z2 . This symmetry not\nonly allows the lightest particle of the new physics model to be stable but it also usually makes this\nmodel conform more naturally with current data.\nLet's review briefly the experimental evidence for dark matter. First, the radial dependence of\nrotation curves of galaxies give strong evidence for DM. Typical rotation curves in spiral galaxies\nshow a plateau at a distance of several kpc from the galactic center, see Fig1(a). The numerical\nvalue of the velocity at large distances is significantly larger than expected assuming only visible\nmatter. Furthermore such a plateau implies a gravitational mass that increases linearly with the\ngalactic radius, this does not corresponds to the distribution of visible matter. The rotation curve\nfor the Milky Way allows to estimate the density of DM in the Sun orbit. This gives a value of\n\u03c1DM \u2248 0.3GeV /cm3 for the local density. This number enters the computation of the signals for\nDM direct and indirect detection that will be described below.\n\nFigure 1: a) Measured rotation curve for the N6503 galaxy together with estimations of the contribution of\nthe halo, disk and galactic gas to the rotation velocity (dashed). b) Temperature fluctuations measured by\nWMAP. The DM density is extracted from the second peak.\n\nVery precise estimates of the amount of DM were obtained from the WMAP measurement\nof fluctuations in the microwave background temperature[1, 2]. Temperature fluctuations, Fig1(b),\nare connected to fluctuations in the gravitational potential in the time of last scattering. Because\nordinary matter is in a plasma at high temperatures, it can not generate such fluctuations. Precise\nnumerical analyses of WMAP results allow to extract the total density of DM particles in the time\n2\n\n\fTools for Dark Matter in Particle and Astroparticle Physics\n\nAlexander Pukhov\n\nof last scattering. Assuming that the number of DM particles has not changed since then we should\nhave now a DM density around 1GeV /m3 . More precisely,\n\u03a9h2 =\n\n\u03c1DM\n= 0.1099 \u00b1 0.0062\n\u03c1c\n\nwhere \u03c1c is the critical density. This amount of DM is in good agreement with simulations of\nlarge structure formation in Universe. Indeed baryonic matter itself is not able to create galaxies\nbecause of the fast expansion rate of the Universe. Because DM particles have to be non-relativistic\nat the time of last scattering time, from WMAP measurements one can estimate its mass to be\nMDM > 10KeV . This is sufficient to rule out neutrinos as the main component of DM. Therefore it is\nnecessary to extend the SM to explain the nature of DM. The precise measurement of \u03a9h2 provides\na powerful mean to discriminate various extensions of the SM that propose a DM candidate.\nThere are three kinds of astroparticle experiments which allow in principle to detect DM particles and measure some of their properties. First, experiments for indirect DM detection such as\nPAMELA [3, 6], HEAT [4], AMS01 [5], Fermi [7, 15], ATIC [8], HESS [9, 13, 14] INTEGRAL\n[10], Veritas[11], EGRET[12] try to observe the products of DM self annihilation in the galactic\nhalo. The SM particles that are produced in this annihilation will decay to stable particles including\n\u03b3 , e\u00b1 , p( p\u0304) and neutrinos. Indirect detection experiments search primarily for e+ , p\u0304, \u03b3 as the e\u2212\nand p channels suffer from a very large background and the neutrino signal is expected to be low.\nInterpreting the results of indirect detection experiments requires a good understanding of both the\nbackground caused by galactic sources as well as the structure of galactic magnetic fields responsible for the propagation of e+ and p\u0304. For instance, the excess of positrons recently observed by\nPAMELA can be caused either by some exotic DM or some galactic source like supernova. Furthermore large uncertainties in the signal can be caused by a clumpy structure in the DM distribution\n(this can increase the signal by a factor 20).\nDirect detection experiments such as Edelweiss[16], DAMA[17], CDMS[18, 20], Xenon [19,\n21], Zeplin[22] or Cogent[23] measure the recoil energy of the nuclei that would result from an\nelastic DM - nucleus collision in a large detector. To reduce the cosmic rays background such\ndetectors are located deep underground. We should mention that DAMA has for several years\nfound a positive result, such a signal has not yet been confirmed by other experiments [17].\nHigh energy neutrinos produced as a result of the annihilation of DM particles captured in\nthe center of the Sun and the Earth, are searched by Super-Kamiokande [24], Antares [25] or\nIceCube [26]. The rate of DM annihilation inside the Sun/Earth should be equal to the rate of DM\ncapture by the Sun/Earth. These experiments are therefore similar to direct detection experiments\nwhere the Sun or the Earth plays the role of the large detector. These experiments have not yet\nobserved DM events.\nDark matter can also be detected in accelerators such as the Tevatron or the LHC. Despite the\nfact that the direct production of DM particles has a small cross section and that the DM particle\nescapes the detector without leaving a track, a DM particle could be detected at LHC. Indeed such\nparticle appears in the decay chains of new particles that can be directly produced at a collider and\nits signature is a large amount of missing energy [30]. It is therfore possible that the LHC will soon\nshed light on the two fundamental problems in particle physics: Higgs and dark matter.\n3\n\n\fTools for Dark Matter in Particle and Astroparticle Physics\n\nAlexander Pukhov\n\n2. Short review of theoretical models for DM\nMany extensions of the SM that can provide a DM candidate have been proposed. The best\nstudied and most popular models among these are supersymmertic models: the minimal supersymmetric model MSSM [32, 31] and its extensions such as the NMSSM [33] and the CPVMSSM [34].\nIn these models R-parity conservation guarantees the stability of the DM particle. In models with\nflat or warped extra dimensions [37, 38], some parity that depend on the field in extra dimensions\nis responsible for the stability of DM. Furthermore there are models with extended gauge or Higgs\nsectors [42, 43] as well as little Higgs models [39, 40, 41]. In these models the DM candidate can\nbe either a Majorana fermion, a Dirac fermion, a vector boson or a scalar.\n\n3. Calculations needed for DM analyses.\nBecause of the large number of astroparticle experiments and the large number of theoretical\nmodels we need software tools for the computation of DM properties and DM detection rates in\ndifferent experiments. The general theoretical formulas for DM calculations are available in the\nreview [27]. Detailed relic density calculations in the MSSM can be found in [28, 29] while direct\ndetection formulas including loop corrections and subleading terms was obtained in [36]. The\ndifferent tasks which have to be solved are\n\u2022 Calculation of DM relic density. The formalism to calculate the DM density using the freezeout mechanism and based on the DM annihilation cross sections was developed in [28, 29].\nOne has to solve a differential equation that gives the temperature dependence of DM density. The dependence on the underlying model appears via the calculation of the thermally\naveraged cross section for DM annihilation. A rough estimation gives a value for the annihilation cross section around \u03c3 (v)v \u2248 1pb * c. This corresponds to a typical weak interaction\ncross section. Nevertheless agreement with WMAP results strongly constrain the parameters\nof the particle physics model. In addition to DM anihilation processes, processes involving\nother particles that are odd under the discrete symmetry and whose masses are just above\nthat of DM also contribute to the effective cross section since eventually all these particles\nwill decay into the DM and some other particles. The large number of processes involved\nand the fact that a priori the matrix elements needed are not known means that relic density\ncalculations in a generic model of Dm can be challenging.\n\u2022 Calculation of DM - nucleon cross sections. These are required for the prediction of rates\nin direct detection and neutrino telescope experiments. In the standard case one needs to\ncompute the DM-nuclei scattering amplitude in the limit of small momentum transfer. This\nis obtained from the DM-nucleon amplitude which is in turn related to DM-quark amplitudes.\n\u2022 Calculation of indirect detection signal. In addition to the calculation of the DM annihilation cross section, the computation of the spectra of photons, positrons and antiprotons are\nrequired. The initial spectra can be easily obtained even for a generic model. For this one\nhas to calculate all 2 \u2192 2 annihilation cross sections and extract the \u03b3 , e+ and p\u0304 spectra\nusing Pythia. The 2 \u2192 2 + \u03b3 processes also might have to be taken into account[35]. The\n4\n\n\fTools for Dark Matter in Particle and Astroparticle Physics\n\nAlexander Pukhov\n\npropagation of e+ and p\u0304 can be done by solving the diffusion equation by the Green function\nmethod. A more precise treatment as well as the computation of the background require a\nMonte Carlo simulation.\n\u2022 Calculation of low energy constraints. Several experimental data restrict the parameter space\nof SM extensions even though they are not directly related to DM observables. These include\nprecision measurements such as the muon anomalous magnetic moment, g \u2212 2, or rare Bdecays for example b \u2192 s\u03b3 , Bs \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 . In most cases the theoretical prediction require the\ncomputation of higher order processes involving Feynman diagrams at the loop level. These\nare not completely automatized yet.\n\u2022 LEP and Tevatron constraints. High energy collider experiments are probing the SM and its\nextensions. Their results can be used to put constraints on the Higgs mass, on new channels\nin Z decay and on the mass of heavy exotic particles including the supersymmetric partners\nof SM particles.\n\u2022 Calculation of LHC and ILC signals The computation of signals associated with new particles produced at colliders include the matrix element calculation for the production and\nfor the decays of the new particles as well as Monte Carlo phase space integration and cuts\nimplementation. Several tools have ben developed to perform these tasks.\n\n4. Review of software for DM calculation\nThere are several public codes used in DM calculations which were designed for the study of\nphysics beyond the SM, for a review of the different tools see [53, 54]. Several codes perform the\ncomputation of the particle mass spectrum in supersymmetric models, indeed large loop corrections are generic and need to be taken into account. These codes also solve the renormalization\ngroup equations in supersymmetric scenarios with fundamental parameters defined at the GUT\nscale. Four codes were developed in the framework of the MSSM, SoftSUSY [47], Isajet [58, 57]\nand SPheno [46], while NMSSMTools [49] and CPsuperH[45] deal with extensions of the MSSM.\nThese codes also compute various low energy and collider constraints. A special file interface\nSLHA [51, 52] was designed for these programs. This interface facilitates their use in DM related\ncode. The package HiggsBounds [50] was designed for testing LEP and Tevatron accelerator constraints on the Higgs sector in generic models. Such constraints are available in NMSSMTools and\nIsajet but only for the specific class of models they support.\nA very important tool for analysis of indirect detection experiments is the GALPROP[55]\nprogram. It gives a numerical solution for the differential equation that describes the propagation\nof different kind of particles in the galactic magnetic fields. Although this code is rather slow it\nallows to take into account both DM signals and background galactic sources at the same time.\nThere are four public codes for DM studies in supersymmetry, SuperIso[59], IsaTools [58,\n57] DarkSUSY [56] and micrOMEGAs [60, 61, 62]. All perform the computation of the DM\nrelic density together with other observables that are not necessarily related to DM. SuperIso is\na rather new code that is primarily dedicated to flavour physics in the MSSM, the SLHA is used\nfor interfacing spectrum calculators. IsaTools and DarkSUSY were also both developed for the\n5\n\n\fTools for Dark Matter in Particle and Astroparticle Physics\n\nAlexander Pukhov\n\nMSSM. They calculate the direct detection and indirect detection rates as well as low energy and\naccelerator constraints. IsaTools uses Isajet to compute the particle spectrum while DarkSUSY also\nuses SuSpect or the SLHA. DarkSUSY also calculates the neutrino rates from DM annihilation\nin the Sun and the Earth, furthermore DarkSUSY includes the propagation of cosmic rays. In\nparticular it is interfaced with GALPROP which allows to study both signal and background in\nindirect detection measurements. For MSSM applications, DarkSUSY is now the most complete\npackage. On the other hand IsaTools is based on Isajet, a tool for computation of signals for SM and\nits supersymmetric extensions at colliders and is therfore most suited for DM accelerator studies.\nmicrOMEGAs is the only package for DM studies in generic extensions of the SM model.\nDetails of the techniques used in micrOMEGAs are explained in the next section. micrOMEGAs\ncomputes the DM relic density, direct detection and indirect detection rates. For the propagation\nof e+ and p\u0304, micrOMEGAs uses a Green function method which describes well the signals from\nDM annihilation but does not allow to calculate the background. The neutrino rate from capture\nin celestial bodies is not yet implemented in micrOMEGAs. Low energy and collider constraints\nare provided for some models and the predictions of collider signals are obtained from CalCHEP\nwhich is included in micrOMEGAs. The current version of micrOMEGAs contains the MSSM,\nNMSSM, CPVMSSM, the Little Higgs model [41], and a Dirac Neutrino DM model [44].\nComparisons of IsaTools/DarkSUSY/micrOMEGAs showed good agreement between the codes.\nIn fact such cross checks were used to remove several bugs in these packages.\n\n5. Applications of automatic matrix element calculators for dark matter studies.\nIn principle it is not necessary to use only one universal program to study DM properties in any\nmodel. On the other hand once such a tool has been tested and debugged for one specific extension\nof the SM, it can rapidly and straightforwardly be used for other models as well. An automatic\napproach therfore increases the reliability of the software and considerably reduces the time needed\nfor developing new software as well as the time required for the user to become familiar with a new\npackage.\nAs mentionned above the most important computer task needed for DM studies is the computation of matrix elements of various reactions which occur in some specific model of particle\nphysics. In the last years several automatic calculators of matrix elements were developed: CompHEP [63], CalcHEP[64], FeynArts/FormCalc [65, 66, 67], MadGraph[68, 69], Sherpa[70], and\nOmega [71]. In principle any of these could be used for DM related calculations in a generic\nmodel. Currently the idea of automatic matrix element generation for DM observables in a generic\nmodel is realized in full scope only in the micrOMEGAs package. This approach was first applied\nfor the computation of the relic density [60]. In [61] a numerical algorithm for the calculation\nof the spin-dependent and spin-independent DM-nucleon amplitudes relevant for direct detection\nwas proposed and implemented. This algorithm which can be applied to a generic model replaces\nthe usual symbolic computation of amplitudes by means of Fiertz identities. Recently in [62] an\nautomatic approach for calculating the spectra of DM self annihilation in the galaxy was designed\nand takes into account processes with additional photon radiation [35].\nThe key point in micrOMEGAs' approach to DM calculations is the generation of shared\nlibraries with matrix element codes. The calculation of all matrix elements that enter a relic density\n6\n\n\fTools for Dark Matter in Particle and Astroparticle Physics\n\nAlexander Pukhov\n\ncalculation is computer time consuming and requires a lot of disk space [56]. However for any\nparticular set of model parameters in general only a small number of annihilation channels are\nneeded. micrOMEGAs therefore generates the code only for the channels as they are needed, links\nthem dynamically and stores them on the disk for subsequent usage.\nNote that the idea of using automatic calculators in DM codes was also realised in IsaTools and\nSuperIso albeit only in the context of the MSSM. In IsaTools, CompHEP was used for generating\n(co-)annihilation cross sections while SuperIso relies on FeynCalc to evaluate the cross sections.\nIn principle both these codes can be generalized for other models.\n\n6. Conclusion\nSeveral tools for the calculation of DM properties and DM signals for current and future experiments are now available. The currently most developed codes are DarkSUSY and micrOMEGAs.\nThe existence of several independent codes is very important for cross checking the results and for\nunderstanding uncertainties which result from different technical implementation of the same algorithms. There are several auxiliary tools designed for the computation of the particle spectra and\ncouplings as well as for calculation of low energy and high energy constraints. The development\nof interface protocols for data exchange between such programs is needed.\n\n7.
