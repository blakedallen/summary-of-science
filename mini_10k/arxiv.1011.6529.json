Such\nQND measurements on superconducting flux qubits have\nbeen reported2,3 . However, these QND schemes work\nonly far away from the degeneracy point (the 'sweet spot'\nwhere the sensitivity to noise is minimized), and the QND\ncriterion is only approximately satisfied. Here we propose\nan ideal QND measurement scheme of a flux qubit that\ncan be applied in a wide range of bias conditions. The\nQND fidelity for this measurement is expected to increase\nsignificantly as compared to previous proposals.\nIn quantum mechanics, measurements induce backaction to the system under investigation due to Heisenberg uncertainty. This back-action puts a fundamental\nlimit on the precision of repeated measurements. In order to beat the standard quantum limit1,4 , the concept of\nQND measurement was developed in the context of gravitational wave detection where repeated measurements\nbeyond the standard quantum limit are required5 . This\nconcept has been extended from gravitational wave detection to other physical systems. A number of experiments has been performed in a micromechanical system6\nand quantum optical systems7 . This special type of measurement leaves the output state unaffected by subsequent measurements and the free evolution of the system.\nQND measurements are crucial to overcome detector inefficiencies, and to quantify the external disturbance to\nthe QND variables. It is also found to have more versatile\napplications such as error correction8, one-way quantum\ncomputing9 , low-noise amplification10 and entanglement\ngeneration11,12 .\nIn superconducting qubit systems, weak continuous\nQND measurements on superconducting transmon qubits\nhave been realized in the dispersive limit13 . This circuit QED system has also been used to detect single microwave photons in a coplanar wave guide14 . Using the\nJosephson bifurcation amplifier, strong projective QND\nmeasurements have been demonstrated for quantronium\nqubits, flux qubits, and transmon qubits2,15,16 . In order\nto implement QND detection for a continuous QND vari-\n\nable, a number of criteria have to be satisfied4,5 . Among\nthem, the most restrictive one is that the system free\nHamiltonian Hs commutes with the interaction Hint between the system and the detector, i.e., [Hs , Hint ] = 0.\nFor existing flux qubit measurements2,3 , this QND criterion is only approximately satisfied when the qubit is\nbiased far away from the degeneracy point. However,\nthe quantum coherence times for solid-state qubit vanish\nrapidly in this regime. QND detection close to the qubit\ndegeneracy point is therefore desired. Moreover, to acquire full qubit control, the qubit bias has to be changed\nduring various operations. After implementing an operation at a certain bias, it is desirable to be able to carry\nout a QND measurement at that point, without adiabatically shifting back to another bias value. In this paper,\nby introducing an rf SQUID coupler to mediate the interaction between a flux qubit and the detector, a Josephson\nbifurcation amplifier (JBA), we find a detection scheme\nthat allows to implement a QND measurement at arbitrary bias including the degeneracy point. Moreover,\nour scheme works beyond the dispersive limit and can be\nextended to the case of strong qubit-detector coupling.\nThis will help to improve the readout contrast to achieve\na higher measurement fidelity and shorter measurement\ntimes.\nAnother advantage of this scheme is the possibility to\nimprove the so-called QND fidelity, which quantifies the\naccuracy of repeated measurements. In QND measurements by a JBA2,15 , the drive on the JBA is first ramped\nto the bifurcation point to induce transitions between two\nbistable states. It is then reduced to maintain a latching\nplateau. The circuit geometry in the previous experiments does not implement an ideal QND measurement,\ni.e., [Hs , Hint ] 6= 0. Qubit relaxation is then accelerated by the forced oscillations of the nonlinear resonator.\nThe population fraction lost during the latching plateau\nand the preparation stage of the subsequent measurement limit the accuracy of the subsequent measurement.\nIt turns out that the JBA induced qubit relaxation is\nthe main limiting factor for the QND fidelity17 . In our\ndesign, if proper control on the bias is acquired, the detection scheme is an ideal QND measurement. The QND\nfidelity is only limited by environment-induced qubit re-\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Schematic diagram of the circuit. Red\npart: gradiometer flux qubit to be measured.

II,\nwe describe the circuit layout and the effective mutual\ninductance between the qubit and the JBA. The QND\nfeature of this detection is analyzed in Sec. III, where two\nsituations with bias at and off the degeneracy point are\ndiscussed respectively. In Sec. IV, we revisit the working\nprinciple of the JBA and calculate the qubit relaxation\nrates in the measurement process. With those relaxation\nrates, the fidelity of the QND measurement is evaluated.\nSection V discusses and summarizes our results.\n\nII.\n\nTHE CIRCUIT LAYOUT\n\nPrevious measurements can only work in the regime\nfar away from the degeneracy point. This is because\nthe measurement circuit (e.g. a Josephson bifurcation\namplifier) can only be coupled to supercurrents in the\nloop. However in the conventional 3-Josephson junction\ndesign18,19 , the current states are the eigenstates of the\nsystem only if the qubit is biased to the degeneracy point.\nA natural solution for this problem is to use a gap-tunable\nqubit20\u201322 and couple the measurement device to the dc\nSQUID part. This will enable a QND measurement when\nthe qubit is biased at the degeneracy point. However,\nto implement a QND measurement at variable bias, the\ncoupling with the measurement device has be to mediated in a way that it can always follow the eigenstates of\nthe system. In this paper, we introduce a tunable coupler\nbetween the flux qubit and the Josephson bifurcation amplifier. The qubit shares one control line with the tunable\ncoupler. As the qubit bias is varied, the qubit coupling to\nthe Josephson bifurcation amplifier is modified simulta-\n\nneously. We find that under certain conditions, a perfect\nQND measurement can be performed at variable qubit\nbias.\nThe system we have in mind is shown is shown in\nFig. 1. It is composed of four parts: the system to\nbe measured (red part), the measuring apparatus (blue\npart), the coupler (green part) and the bias circuits (orange parts). The system to be measured is a gradiometertype superconducting flux qubit20,21 which contains four\nJosephson junctions in three loops: The two lower loops\n(the main qubit loops) and the upper loop (the dc SQUID\nloop) penetrated by magnetic fluxes \u03a61 , \u03a62 , and \u03a63 . The\ntwo junctions in the dc SQUID loop are assumed to have\nidentical Josephson energies \u03b10 EJ , here \u03b10 is the ratio\nbetween the Josephson energy of the smaller junctions\nand that of the two bigger junctions. The other two\njunctions are assumed to have the Josephson energy EJ .\nThe total Josephson energy of the circuit is23\nEJ cos \u03c61 + EJ cos \u03c62 + \u03b1EJ cos (2\u03c0\u03a6t /\u03a60 \u2212 (\u03c61 + \u03c62 ))\n(1)\nwhere \u03a6t \u2261 (\u03a61 \u2212 \u03a62 )/2, \u03b1 = 2\u03b10 cos(\u03c0\u03a63 /\u03a60 ), and\n\u03c6k (k = 1, 2, 3, 4) is the phase difference across the k-th\nJosephson junction. If \u03a6t is chosen close to \u03a60 /2 where\n\u03a60 = h/(2e) is the flux quantum, the circuit dynamics can be effectively described in a two-level subspace\nof a double-well potential, and thus constitutes a flux\nqubit18,19 . Together with the charging energy, the total\nHamiltonian of the qubit is\nH = \u03b5(\u03a6t )\u03c3z + \u2206(\u03a63 )\u03c3x .\n\n(2)\n\nThe Pauli matrices read \u03c3z = |0ih0| \u2212 |1ih1|, \u03c3x =\n|0ih1| + |1ih0|, where |0i and |1i denote the states with\nclockwise and counterclockwise currents in the outer\nloop. The energy spacing of the two current states is\n\u03b5(\u03a6t ) \u2261 Ip (\u03a6t \u2212\u03a60 /2), with Ip the magnitude of the classical persistent current in the loop. The tunneling amplitude between the two states \u2206(\u03a63 ) \u2261 \u2206(\u03b1) depends on\nthe bias in the dc SQUID loop. Note that in contrast to\nthe original flux qubit design18,19 , this gradiometer flux\nqubit is insensitive to homogeneous fluctuations of the\nmagnetic flux20 . More importantly, it enables the JBA\nto couple with the dc-SQUID loop without changing the\ntotal bias flux of the qubit.\nThe detector for the flux qubit is a Josephson bifurcation amplifier (JBA)24 (blue part in Fig. 1), which in\nour scheme is a dc SQUID shunted by a capacitance C,\nsubject to a microwave drive IRF cos(\u03c9d t + \u03c6A ). The\nJBA SQUID loop contains two identical Josephson junctions of critical current IA0 . The phase differences across\nthe two junctions are denoted by \u03c6A1 , \u03c6A2 respectively.\nThe current in the loop is IA = I \u0304A (\u03a6A ) cos \u03c6A , with \u03a6A ,\nthe flux bias in the JBA SQUID, set by external coils,\nI \u0304A (\u03a6A ) = 2IA0 sin(\u03c0\u03a6A /\u03a60 ), and \u03c6A = (\u03c6A1 + \u03c6A2 )/2.\nThe JBA circuit forms a driven nonlinear resonator which\nexhibits bistable behavior with hysteresis. With appropriate drive sequences, a transition to one of the bistable\nstates is correlated with the qubit states in a probabilis-\n\n\f3\ntic way. Therefore the qubit state can be read out by the\nphase of the transmitted or reflected microwave.\nThe flux qubit is coupled to the JBA through their\nmutual inductance. There are two contributions to their\nmutual inductance: the direct mutual inductance (DMI)\nMAk (k = 1, 2, and 3 denotes the different loops in the\n\u2032\nqubit) and the effective mutual inductance (EMI) MAk\n.\nHence the JBA produces flux biases to the qubit loops\n\u2032\nof the form (MAk + MAk\n)IA . The EMI is induced by the\nnearby rf SQUID which acts as a coupler for the qubit\nand the JBA. The self-inductance of the coupler is assumed to be much larger than the mutual inductances\nand the dynamics of the coupler is confined to its lowest\nenergy bands25,26 . The DMI is fixed by fabrication processes while the EMI is tunable by the magnetic bias of\nthe coupler \u03a6C as25,27\n\u2032\nMAk\n(\u03a6C ) = \u2212\n\nMAC MCk \u03b2c cos \u03b80\n,\nLC\n1 + \u03b2c cos \u03b80\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03b80 satisfies the nonlinear equation\n\u03b80 =\n\n2\u03c0\n(\u03a6C + MAC IA0 ) \u2212 \u03b2c sin \u03b80\n\u03a60\n\n(4)\n\nwith \u03b2c = 2\u03c0LC IC0 /\u03a60 , LC is the self-inductance of the\ncoupler, and IC0 the circulating coupler current. In particular, if the coupler is biased at \u03a6C = ((2n + 1/2)\u03c0 +\n\u03b2c )\u03a60 /2\u03c0\u2212MAC IA0 or ((2n+3/2)\u03c0\u2212\u03b2c )\u03a60 /2\u03c0\u2212MAC IA0\n(n is an arbitrary integer), the effective mutual induc\u2032\ntance vanishes, MAk\n= 0. Thus, for this bias condition,\nthe EMIs between the JBA and all the qubit loops are\ncanceled, and only the DMIs contribute to the coupling.\nBesides tunability, there is another important difference between the DMI and the EMI: the DMI is symmetric with respect to the qubit loops 1 and 2, while\nthe EMI is not symmetrical, that is, MA1 = MA2 , while\n\u2032\n\u2032\nMA1\n6= MA2\n(since MC1 6= MC2 ). Hence only the EMI\ncouples the JBA to the gradiometer qubit flux \u03a6t in the\nform\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03a6t = (MA1\n\u2212 MA2\n)IA .\n\n(5)\n\nIn our scheme, the whole chip is biased by external\ncoils so that a homogeneous magnetic field threads all\nthe loops. By choosing the area of each loop appropriately, the required background bias values can be imposed. Besides the coupling to the external coils, the dc\nSQUID loop of the qubit is also coupled with an on-chip\nbias current IB3 through MB3 . The qubit loop 1 shares\nanother on-chip bias (the lower orange part) with the\ncoupler. A bias current IB in this bias line couples to the\nqubit loops and the coupler loop through mutual inductances MBk and MBC . In the following discussion, we\nwill see that this shared bias is crucial for the possibility\nto do a QND measurement at arbitrary bias.\n\nIII.\n\nQND NATURE OF THE DETECTION\nSCHEME\n\nIn order to analyze the QND nature of the detection\nscheme, we first look at the situation that the bias is\nset at the degeneracy point and then study the case of a\ngeneral (off-degeneracy) bias.\n\nA.\n\nDegeneracy point\n\nWe first look at the case when the qubit is biased at\nthe degeneracy point \u03a6tb = \u03a60 /2. At this point, the firstorder flux noise disappears so that the qubit quantum\ncoherence can be preserved longer.\nThe qubit is biased at the degeneracy point by trapping\none flux quantum20,21 . The bias current is set to zero\nIB = 0 and the flux bias of the coupler is set by external\ncoils to be\n\u0011\n\u03a60 \u0010 \u03c0\n\u03a6Cb =\n(6)\n+ \u03b2c \u2212 MAC I \u0304A .\n2\u03c0 2\nAccording to the discussion following Eq. (3), the effec\u2032\ntive mutual inductance MAk\nvanishes at this bias. Thus,\nthe qubit only couples to the JBA through the direct\nmutual inductance. As shown in Eq. (5), this means the\nJBA has no influence on \u03a6t , but only couples to \u03a63 . If\n\u03c0MA3 I \u0304A \u226a \u03a60 , the Hamiltonian can be expanded to first\norder as23\nHq = Hq0 + HI ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere Hq0 is the free Hamiltonian of the qubit\nHq0 = \u2206(\u03a63b )\u03c3x ,\n\n(8)\n\nand HI is the interaction between the qubit and the JBA\nHI = \u03bb(\u03a63b )\u03c3x cos \u03c6A .\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03a63b is the total flux bias of the dc SQUID loop\n(generated by both external coils and IB3 ).

The coupling energy between the qubit and the JBA is tunable by \u03a63b .\nEquations (7) \u2013 (9) show that the free Hamiltonian\ncommutes with the interaction Hamiltonian. If one\nchooses \u03c3x as the measurement observable, a QND measurement can be implemented.\n\n\f4\nB.\n\nGeneral (off-degeneracy) bias\n\nIf we change the current in the shared bias by a small\namount IB = \u03b4IB , the qubit is biased away from the\ndegeneracy point, and the corresponding bias change in\nthe qubit loop is \u03b4\u03a6t = (MB1 \u2212 MB2 )\u03b4IB . Since the\ncoupler shares the same bias, the magnetic flux penetrating the coupler bias is also shifted by a small amount\nMBC \u03b4IB (MBC \u03b4IB \u226a \u03a6Cb is always satisfied in the relevant operation regime). This will induce a non-zero\n\u2032\neffective mutual inductance MAk\n(\u03a6Cb + MBC \u03b4IB ) =\n2\n\u2212(2\u03c0/\u03a60 ) Ic0 MAC MCk MBC \u03b4IB . As we discussed after\nEq. (5), a non-zero EMI will couple the JBA to the qubit\nflux bias \u03a6t as well as \u03a63 . The qubit Hamiltonian under\nthis bias reads\nHq = Hq0 + HI\n\n(11)\n\nwith\nHq0 = \u03a9z \u03c3z + \u03a9x \u03c3x\n\n(12)\n\nthe main qubit loop, but it does not work for variable bias\nvalues of the dc SQUID loop in the general case. However, we would also like to point out that if the qubit is\nbiased away from the degeneracy point, by changing \u03b5,\nany arbitrary single-qubit operation can be implemented;\nin this sense, it is not necessary to tune \u03a63b . Also, if the\nqubit is biased at the degeneracy point, which is also the\nsituation in which tuning \u03a63b is meaningful, the QND\nmeasurement can be implemented for variable \u03a63b .\nFor \u03b7 = 1, the results obtained for the degeneracy\npoint and general (off-degeneracy) bias can be written in\na uniform way as\nHq0 = \u03a9\u03c3\u0303z\n(17)\np\nwith \u03a9 = \u03a92x + \u03a92z , and \u03c3\u0303z = (\u03a9z \u03c3z + \u03a9x \u03c3x )/\u03a9. The\ninteraction Hamiltonian is\nHI = \u03bb\u03c3\u0303z cos \u03c6A\n(18)\np\nwith \u03bb = \u03bb2z + \u03bb2x . At the degeneracy point, \u03a9z = \u03bbz =\n0, so that \u03c3\u0303z = \u03c3x .\n\nand the interaction Hamiltonian\nIV.\n\nHI = (\u03bbz \u03c3z + \u03bbx (\u03a63b )\u03c3x ) cos \u03c6A\nwith \u03a9z = Ip \u03b4\u03a6t , \u03a9x = \u2206(\u03a63b ) and\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03bbz = Ip (MA1\n\u2212 MA2\n)I \u0304A ,\n\n(14)\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2032\nMA3\n.\n\u03bbx (\u03a63b ) = \u03bb(\u03a63b ) 1 +\nMA3\n\n(15)\n\nIf we define a parameter \u03b7 = \u03bbz \u03a9x /\u03bbx \u03a9z , it is straightforward to see that the free qubit Hamiltonian commutes\nwith the interaction Hamiltonian when \u03b7 = 1. Therefore,\na sufficient condition to implement a QND measurement\nat variable flux bias is\n\u03b7(\u03a63b ) = 4\u03c0\n\nMBC Ic0 MC1 MAC \u2206(\u03a63b )\n=1\n\u03a60 MB1 MA3 \u03ba(\u03a63b )\n\nMEASUREMENT FIDELITY\n\n(13)\n\n(16)\n\nwhere we have neglected MB2 , MC2 , and MC3 since they\nare much smaller than the other mutual inductances.\nIn other words, if \u03b7 = 1, as the qubit is biased away\nfrom the degeneracy point, the interaction with the JBA\nis changed accordingly, so that the interaction Hamiltonian always commutes with the qubit free Hamiltonian.\nThis condition is possible to be satisfied experimentally,\ne.g., if \u03b10 = 0.4, and the bias \u03a63b satisfies \u1fb1 = 0.7. At\nthis bias, \u2206/(d\u2206/d\u1fb1) \u2248 \u22120.1128 . If IC0 = 1 \u03bcA, MBC =\n23.5 pH, MC1 = 25 pH, MB1 = 5 pH, MAC = 25 pH,\nMA3 = 5 pH, then \u03b7 = 1. Note that \u03b7 depends on the\nbias \u03a63b which is tunable in situ, i.e., by tuning IB3 .\nThus, errors in the fabrication process can be compensated to satisfy Eq. (16), the condition for QND detection. Note that \u03a63b is determined by this condition since\nall the other parameters are fixed by fabrication. Therefore, this QND scheme works for variable bias values of\n\nThe JBA is an oscillator with nonlinear Josephson inductance. Under a strong microwave drive, the Josephson energy of the junction \u2212EJA cos \u03c6A is expanded beyond the harmonic approximation and the classical dynamics can be described by a Duffing oscillator29 . For a\ncertain range of drive conditions, the nonlinear oscillator\nexhibits bistable behavior with hysteresis24,29 . The two\npossible stable states correspond to different oscillation\namplitudes and phases, which can be distinguished by\ntransmitted or reflected microwave signals2,15,16 . Switching between the two stable states happens when the\ndrive power reaches a certain threshold. The switching probability depends on the value of the nonlinear\ninductance, which in our case depends on the states of\nthe qubit through the mutual inductance. This is because the effective Josephson energy of the junctions\nof the JBA is modified by the interaction Eq. (18) as\nEJA (\u03c3\u0303z ) = I \u0304A \u03a60 /2\u03c0 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c3\u0303z . Therefore, measuring the\nphase of the transmitted microwave signal, one can read\nout the state of the qubit.\nThe back-action from the measurement device destroys\nthe phase coherence of the qubit states during the readout process. Besides dephasing, the back-action could\nalso induce relaxation to the qubit. This is the case for a\n \u0303 x with a small nonqubit Hamiltonian Hq0 = \u03a9\u03c3\u0303z + \u2206\u03c3\u0303\n \u0303 see e.g. the QND measurement of\nideal QND fraction \u2206,\n \u0303\nRef. 2 where \u2206/\u03a9\n\u2248 0.34. The JBA is strongly coupled\nto a dissipative environment while weakly coupled to the\nqubit. Hence it serves as a bath for the qubit. According\nto Eq. (18), the influence of the JBA on the qubit can be\ndescribed by its correlation function\nZ \u221e\ndtei\u03c9t hcos \u03c6A (t) cos \u03c6A (0)i ,\n(19)\nG(\u03c9) =\n0\n\n\f5\nand the induced decay rate can be calculated through the\nFermi golden rule. The Bloch Redfield rates induced by\nthe operation of the JBA are\np\n \u0303\n\u03bb2 \u2206\n \u0303 2 ))\nR(G( \u03a92 + \u2206\n\u0393r = p\n2\n2\n \u0303\n\u03a9 +\u2206\n\u03bb2 \u03a9\n\u0393\u03c6 = p\nR(G(0)) ,\n(20)\n \u03032\n\u03a92 + \u2206\n\nwhere \u0393r is the induced relaxation rate and \u0393\u03c6 is the induced dephasing rate. When the JBA is ramped to the\nmeasurement level and the latching plateau, the correlation function is prominently increased due to quantum\nactivation30 . Qubit decay is enhanced by the measurement operation17,31 . This results in qubit relaxation and\nthe measurement is driven away from the QND regime.\nThis induced relaxation has been found to be the main\nsource of measurement error2,17 . One way to reduce this\nback-action is working in the dispersive limit16 . In our\n \u0303 = 0,\ncase, an ideal QND measurement is possible, i.e. \u2206\nso that \u0393r = 0, i.e., the JBA does not induce extra relaxation but only dephasing to the qubit. Hence the QND\ncondition can be preserved better in our scheme and the\nQND fidelity can be improved.\nBesides the induced decay rates Eq. (20), there is another decay mechanism due to the flux fluctuations of the\nenvironment. This will perturb the fluxes in the qubit\nloops as \u03b4\u03a6t = \u03bct X and \u03b4\u03a63 = \u03bc3 X, where X represents\nan environmental operator (such as a two-level fluctuator) and \u03bct (\u03bc3 ) characterizes its coupling strength to the\ndifferent qubit loops. Hence the qubit is coupled to the\nenvironment as \u2206H = \u03bet X\u03c3z + \u03be3 X\u03c3x , with \u03bet = Ip \u03a60 \u03bct\nand \u03be3 = \u2212\u03c0\u03bc3 \u03ba(\u03a63b )/\u03a60 .

In a real experiment, the flux noise could have\nmultiple sources, such as two-level fluctuators inside the\nbarrier, high-frequency noise from the control lines20 , and\nothers. Therefore the noise spectrum may exhibit a complicated frequency dependence and have a strong sample dependence. In our discussion, we assume an Ohmic\nnoise spectrum (f -noise) for the environment bath plus\na few peaks due to two-level fluctuators\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013 X\n\u03c9\nSX (\u03c9) = \u03c9R0 coth\nSi \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9i ) ,\n+1 +\n2kB T0\ni\n(22)\nwhere R0 is the Ohmic impedance and T0 is the environmental temperature.

Here we assume that the\ntime interval between two measurements is \u03c4 = 50 ns,\nT0 = 20 mK, the qubit relaxation time is 250 ns at the\ndegeneracy point, and the value of \u2206 is fixed at 7.8 GHz.\nThe plot shows that the measurement fidelity remains\nrather high for a wide range of bias values. Even at the\ndegeneracy point \u03b5 = 0 where the relaxation is strong,\na measurement fidelity larger than 90% can be achieved.\nAs the bias is increased to the positive side, the fidelity\nincreases as the relaxation decreases. Far above the degeneracy point, the measurement fidelity is very close to\n100%. Note that the fidelity is not symmetrical with respect to the axis \u03b5 = 0 but becomes more symmetrical\nas k decreases. At k = 0, the curve shows complete symmetry because noise only contributes to the main qubit\nloop, it is symmetrical with respect of the sign of the\nqubit bias. The inset of Fig. 2 shows that the QND fidelity at the degeneracy point decreases with the SQUID\nbias \u03c0\u03a63b /\u03a60 .

This is actually\none of the main applications of QND measurements: detecting perturbations to the system. The QND nature\nof the measurement guarantees that the readout backaction will not change the value of the observable. The\nmeasurement fidelity therefore reflects the noise spectrum of the environment. For example, the existence\nof one two-level fluctuator inside the barrier32,33 would\nbe revealed by a corresponding peak in the QND fidelity\nat a certain bias.\n\nV.\n\nDISCUSSION AND SUMMARY\n\nAll the discussion above is based on the gradiometer\ntype-flux qubit. However, with a few modifications as explained below, the measurement protocol can be adapted\nto non-gradiometer type flux qubits with a tunable gap22 ,\nsee Fig. 3. Two current bias lines ICb and I1b are used\nto control the coupler and the qubit separately in order\nto guarantee a QND measurement for a non-gradiometer\nflux qubit at the degeneracy point.\nThe background bias of a non-gradiometer qubit is sensitive to homogeneous magnetic field fluctuations, but\ncan be implemented easily by external coils (while the\ngradiometer qubit requires the technique to trap fluxoids). Also, it is possible to achieve a more sensitive tuning comparing with the gradiometer qubit. This can be\nseen from Fig. 4 which shows the scaled effective mutual\ninductance with respect to the coupler bias. To achieve a\nmore sensitive tuning within the tunable range of the onchip bias (typically on the order of m\u03a60 \u2261 10\u22123 \u03a60 ), the\ncoupler is desired to be pre-biased close to \u03a60 /2. How-\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Dependence of the scaled effective mu\u2032\ntual inductance M \u2032 = MAk\n/(MAC MCk /LC ) on the coupler\nbias \u03a6 = \u03a6CB +MAC IA0 , see Eq. (3). The red dots on the two\nsides (intersections with the dashed line) indicate the background bias in the case of the gradiometer qubit, while the\ngreen point in the middle is an example of the background\nbias for a non-gradiometer qubit. Here \u03b2c = 0.9.\n\n\u2032\never, in the case of the gradiometer qubit, since MAk\nshould be zero when the qubit is biased at the degeneracy point, the background bias should be set around the\nred points in Fig. 4, i.e., relatively far from \u03a60 /2. For\nnon-gradiometer qubits, the background bias point is determined by the fabrication process. If the mutual inductance between the JBA and qubit is large and the coupler\nloop is twisted as indicated in Fig. 4, the background bias\ncan be set closer to \u03a60 /2 (say, the green point in Fig. 4).\nAs a result, a more sensitive tuning can be achieved. For\nexample, if we assume MA3 = 5 pH, MA1 = 0.5 pH,\nMAC = 10 pH, LC = 100 pH, MC1 = 10 pH, I \u0304A = 1 \u03bcA,\nfor a change in the qubit bias \u03b4\u03a6t = 2 m\u03a60 , the coupler\nbias \u03a6CB should be tuned by 15 m\u03a60 in the case of the\ngradiometer qubit, while only 0.4 m\u03a60 in the case of a\nnon-gradiometer qubit.\n\nIn summary, we have studied a scheme to realize a quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement for\ngradiometer-type flux qubits by a Josephson bifurcation\namplifier. We have shown that a perfect QND measurement can be implemented for a qubit with variable\nmagnetic bias. The QND fidelity of this measurement\nis expected to be high over a wide range of bias conditions. We have also discussed how to generalize our\nscheme to non-gradiometer qubits. Our estimates indicate that such a QND measurement may be realized experimentally, and we hope that this will happen in the\nclose future.\n\n\f7\nVI.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\n\nThis work was financially supported by the EC ISTFET project SOLID, the Swiss SNF, and the NCCR\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\nV.
