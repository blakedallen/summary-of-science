INTRODUCTION\nSince the start of Run II in 2001, the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) [1] has collected over 1 fb\u22121 of data of pp\u0304 collisions at 1.96 TeV center-of-mass energy. In a variety\nof resulting publications, the simulation of the calorimeter has proved to be a crucial element for the precision measurement of physical observables, like the mass of the top\nquark, since it appears as one of the keys to control the jet energy scale systematics.\nThe CDF calorimeter simulation is based on GFLASH [2], a FORTRAN package used\nfor the fast simulation of electromagnetic and hadronic showers. It is embedded in a\nGEANT3 framework [3] as part of the whole detector simulation and has various advantages w.r.t. the detailed GEANT shower simulation: In CDF it is up to 100 times faster,\nand it can be flexibly tuned. The calorimeter simulation was initially tuned to test beam\ndata and has been improved due to a steadily refined in situ tuning using samples of\nisolated charged particles, which recently became available over a remarkably extended\nmomentum range up to 40 GeV. Here we report on the GFLASH performance effective\nfor current CDF physics publications and on ongoing improvements contributing to the\nambitious Run II physics program.\n\n2. CDF CALORIMETRY\nCDF is a general-purpose charged and neutral particle detector with a calorimeter and\na tracking system. The calorimeter has a central and a forward section subdivided into\na total of five compartments (Fig. 1): the central electromagnetic, CEM [4], the central\nhadronic, CHA [5], the plug electromagnetic, PEM [6], the plug hadronic, PHA [6],\nand the wall hadronic, WHA [5]. The calorimeter is of sampling type, with lead (iron)\n\n\fCentral\n\nPlug\n\n19 X0, 1\u03bb\n\n21 X0, 1\u03bb\n\nsample(Pb)\n\n0.6 X0\n\n0.8 X0\n\nsample(scint.)\n\n5 mm\n\n4.5 mm\n\nEM\n\nthickness\n\nwavelength sh.\n\nHAD\n\nsheet\nfiber\n13.5%\n14.5%\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2295 2%\n\u2295 1%\nresolution\nET\nE\nthickness\n4.5 \u03bb\n7\u03bb\n\nsample(Fe)\nsample(scint.)\nwavelength sh.\n\n25-50 mm\n\n50 mm\n\n10 mm\n\n6 mm\n\nfinger\n50%\n\u2295 3%\nresolution \u221a\nET\n\nfiber\n70%\n\u221a \u2295 4%\nE\n\nFIGURE 1.

It is subdivided into 44 projective tower groups, each group made of\n24 wedges (partially 48 in the plug part) circularly arranged around the Tevatron beam\nand pointing to the nominal event vertex. The central and plug part together cover the\npseudorapidity range |\u03b7 | < 3.6. The calorimeter encloses a tracking system consisting\nof a vertex detector and a cylindrical drift chamber, both situated within a 1.4 T solenoid\nmagnet. It provides a precise measurement of single charged particle momenta serving\nas an energy reference for the calorimeter simulation tuning.\n\n3. GFLASH IN A NUTSHELL\nThe CDF simulation uses GEANT to propagate particles from the main interaction point\nthrough the detector volume. A shower in GFLASH is initiated when a particle undergoes\nthe first inelastic interaction in the calorimeter. GFLASH treats the calorimeter as one\neffective medium using GEANT geometry and material information. GFLASH is ideal for\ncalorimeter modules which may have a complicated but repetitive sampling structure.\nGiven an incident particle energy, Einc , the visible energy in the active medium,\n#\n\"\n\u0125\n\u00ea\ncem fem (r) + chad fhad (r) dr ,\n(1)\ndEvis (r) = Einc m\u0302\nm\u0302\nm\u0302\nis calculated according to the sampling fractions for electrons (\u00ea) and hadrons (\u0125)\nrelative to the sampling fraction for minimum ionizing particles (m\u0302), taking their relative\nfractions cem and chad of energy deposited in the active medium into account. fem (r)\nand fhad (r) are electromagnetic and hadronic spatial energy distributions of the form\nf (r) = 21\u03c0 L(z) * T (r, z), factorizing into a longitudinal profile L(z), which is a function\nof the shower depth z, and a lateral profile T (r, z), which depends on z and on the radial\ndistance r from the shower center. The showers are treated as azimuthally symmetric.\n\n\fThe longitudinal electromagnetic profiles are assumed to follow a Gamma distribution,\nx\u03b1 \u22121 e\u2212x\nLem (x) =\n,\n(2)\n\u0393(\u03b1 )\nwhere x = \u03b2 z and z measured in units of radiation lengths X0 . \u03b1 and \u03b2 are correlated\nparameters generated using two Gaussians, whose means and widths are free parameters\nsubject to tuning, and a correlation matrix hardwired in GFLASH. Longitudinal hadronic\nshower profiles are a superposition of three shower classes:\nLhad (x) = fdep [ch Lh (xh ) + cf Lf (xf ) + cl Ll (xl )] ,\nLi (xi ) =\n\nx\u03b1i i \u22121 e\u2212xi\n\u0393(\u03b1i )\n\n, xi = \u03b2i zi\n\n(i = h , f , l) .\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nLh is a purely hadronic component (zh given in units of absorption lengths \u03bb0 ). Lf\naccounts for the component induced by neutral pions from a first inelastic interaction\n([zf ] = X0 ), and Ll originates from neutral pions occurring in later stages of the shower\ndevelopment ([zl ] = \u03bb0 ). Each subprofile in Eq. (4) is characterized by an individual correlated pair (\u03b1 , \u03b2 ) analogously to Eq. (2). The coefficients ci are the relative probabilities\nof the three classes expressed in terms of the fraction of showers containing a neutral\npion ( f\u03c0 0 ) and the fraction of showers with a neutral pion in later interactions ( f\u03c0l 0 ):\nch = 1 \u2212 f\u03c0 0 , cf = f\u03c0 0 (1 \u2212 f\u03c0l 0 ) , cl = f\u03c0 0 f\u03c0l 0 .\n\n(5)\n\nThe global factor fdep is the fraction of deposited energy w.r.t. the energy of the incident\nparticle. When a shower is generated, correlations between all parameters are properly\ntaken into account. In total, the longitudinal shower profile is described by 18 independent parameters for the hadronic part (the means and widths of the \u03b1 's, \u03b2 's, and of the\nfractions fdep , f\u03c0 0 and f\u03c0l 0 ), and four parameters for the purely electromagnetic part.\nThe lateral energy profile at a given shower depth z has the functional form\nT (r) =\n\n2rR20\n.\n(r2 + R20 )2\n\n(6)\n\nThe free quantity R0 is given in units of Moli\u00e8re radius (for electromagnetic) or absorption lengths (for hadronic showers), respectively. R0 is an approximate log-normal\ndistribution with a mean and a variance parametrized as a function of the incident particle energy Einc and shower depth z. The mean is given by\nhR0 (Einc, z)i = [R1 + (R2 \u2212 R3 ln Einc )z]n ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere n=1(2) for the hadronic (electromagnetic) case. The spread of hadronic showers\nincreases linearly with shower depth z and decreases logarithmically with Einc . Both\nshower types have their own set of adjustable parameter values (the Ri plus three\nindependent parameters for the variance), thus giving a total of 12 parameters.\nAfter generating the profiles, GFLASH distributes the incident particle energy in discrete interval steps following the longitudinal profile, and then deposits energy spots in\n\n\fthe simulated calorimeter volume according to the lateral profile. The number of energy\nspots is smeared to account for sampling fluctuations. The visible energy is obtained by\nintegrating over the energy spots and applying the relative sampling fractions Eq. (1).\n\n4. GFLASH TUNING METHOD\nThe tuning of GFLASH mostly relies on test beams of electrons and charged pions\nwith energies between 8 and 230 GeV [7], and has been refined during Run II using\nthe calorimeter response of single isolated tracks in the momentum range 0.5-40 GeV/c\nmeasured in situ. The tuning of hadronic showers follows a four-step procedure.\nAdjusting the MIP peak. Reproducing the response of minimum ionizing particles\n(MIP) is the first step since it serves as a reference for all other responses, see Eq. (1).\nThe position and width of the simulated MIP peak is tuned to 57 GeV test beam pions\nin the electromagnetic compartments and involves the adjustment of charge collection\nefficiencies, which is handled by GEANT at this stage of the simulation.\nSetting the hadronic energy scale and shape. Next, the shape of the individual energy distributions in the electromagnetic and hadronic compartment, the sum of both,\nand the hadronic response of MIP-like particles in the hadronic compartment are adjusted. The tuning is based on 57 GeV test beam pions and involves the most sensitive\nlongitudinal parameters, the means and widths of \u03b1l and \u03b2l (steering the shower component induced by \u03c0 0 's from later interactions), of \u03b2h (which is related to the purely\nhadronic component), see Eq. (4), and of the fractions fdep and f\u03c0 0 in Eqn. (3) and (5).\nFixing the energy dependence. After the longitudinal profile has been adjusted at\none energy point, the other test beam samples are employed to parametrize the energy\ndependence of the parameters, which is typically logarithmic. At this point, also the\ninclusion of in situ tracks is important in order to provide a robust extrapolation into the\nimportant low energy region where test beam data are not available. A functional form\nf (Einc ) = a + b tanh(c ln Einc + d) is used to describe the dependence of the fractions\nin Eqn. (3) and (5) on the incident particle energy Einc . Distinct parametrizations in the\ncentral and plug calorimeter were introduced to account for their different sampling\nstructure. Initial Run II tunes involved samples of single isolated tracks up to 5 GeV/c in\nthe central and plug part. Recently, the energy evolution of fdep and the relative sampling\nfractions, \u00ea/m\u0302 and \u0125/m\u0302, have been tuned using the total and MIP-like responses of in\nsitu tracks up to 40 GeV/c (Sec. 6).\nTuning the lateral profile. The lateral profile is treated almost independently from\nlongitudinal profile details and is tuned solely with Run II data. The parameters Ri of\nEq. (7), which have been initially adjusted to describe the profiles in the energy range\n0.5-5.0 GeV/c (using default values provided by the H1 collaboration at higher energies),\nare now tuned up to particle momenta of 40 GeV/c (Sec. 6).\n\n\f0.04\n0.035\n0.03\n\n25<Pave\n<55 GeV/c\nT\nQuadratic sum of all contributions\nCalorimeter simulation hadrons\nCalorimeter simulation EM particles\nMultiplicity\nCalorimeter stability\n\n\u03b2\n\nUncertainties on absolute JES\n\n0.05\n0.045\n\n1.2\n1.1\n1\n\n0.025\n\n0.9\n\n0.02\n0.015\n\n0.8\n\n0.01\n\n0.7\n\n0.005\n\n0.6\n\n0\n\n50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500\n\ntransverse jet energy (GeV)\n\n0.5\n\nData\nMC (PYTHIA)\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\u03b7\n\nFIGURE 2.

IMPACT ON CDF JET ENERGY SCALE\nWe first report on the performance of the early Run II tuning embodied by CDF physics\npublications to date. Despite the good agreement with test beam data [7], the quality of\nthe simulation used to be hard to control in the intermediate energy region, which is of\nparticular importance since it constitutes a relevant fraction of the particle spectrum of a\ntypical jet in CDF. For the initial tuning of the energy evolution of GFLASH parameters,\nminimum bias data providing tracks only up to 5 GeV were involved. Later checks based\non special single track samples at higher momenta revealed a underestimation of the\ndata. The level of agreement in the central was 2% for <12 GeV, 3% for 12 to 20 GeV,\nand 4% for >20 GeV [8]. Through convolution with a jet's typical particle spectrum,\nthese numbers directly translate into the systematic uncertainties of the jet energy scale\nused by CDF to date (Fig. 2, left). The dominant contribution to the total uncertainties\noriginate from discrepancies between the simulated and measured calorimeter response\nand from the low statistical precision of early Run II control samples.\nThe inhomogeneity of the calorimeter response is accounted for by an \u03b7 dependent\ntuning. Jet responses in the plug and wall part are re-calibrated w.r.t. the better underprobe\ntrigger\nstood central part using a correction derived from di-jet events, \u03b2 = pT /pT\n, which\nrelates the transverse momentum pT of the non-central \"probe\" jet to the pT of the central \"trigger\" jet. A comparison of the simulated and measured di-jet balance (Fig. 2,\nright) shows that the tuning is reproducing many calorimeter particularities along \u03b7 .\n\n6. IN SITU TUNING PROGRESS\nThe situation in the central calorimeter has now substantially improved due to the\ndevelopment of dedicated single track triggers with high momentum thresholds up to\n15 GeV/c. The samples collected so far (a total of over 20 M events) allow a precise\nmonitoring of the simulation performance in the energy range 0.5-40 GeV. In addition,\nsteadily increased single track samples selected in minimum bias events now allow a\nconsistent tuning of the plug simulation up to incident particle energies of 20 GeV.\n\n\f0.9\n\nE/p Mean\n\nE/p Mean\n\n1\n\nTOT\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\ndata\nGFLASH\n\n0.3\n\n0.7\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n0.4\n0.3\n\n25\n30\n35\n40\nTrack Momentum (GeV)\n\n0\nE/p Mean\n\n0\n\nCEM\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n30\n35\n40\nTrack Momentum (GeV)\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n30\n35\n40\nTrack Momentum (GeV)\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n30\n35\n40\nTrack Momentum (GeV)\n\nCHA\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0\n0\n\nMIP\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\n0.4\n\nE/p Mean\n\n1\n\n0\n0\n\n5\n\nFIGURE 3. Simulated and measured hE/pi responses vs. track momentum in the central calorimeters\nCEM and CHA, the sum of both (TOT), and the CHA response of MIP-like particles (MIP). The vertical\ndashed lines indicate biases due to momentum dependent track analysis cuts and calculation methods.\n\nMeasurement technique. The in situ approach employs high quality tracks which\nare well contained within the target calorimeter tower (given by the track's extrapolation\ninto the electromagnetic compartment) and which are isolated within a 7\u00d77 tower block\naround the target tower. The signal is defined as the energy deposition seen in a 2\u00d72\nblock (for PEM and CEM) or a 3\u00d73 block (for CHA and PHA), respectively. For the\nbackground estimate, tower strips with the same \u03b7 range but along the edges of a 5\u00d75\ntower group around the target tower are used. The simulation is usually based on a\nparticle gun using a controlled momentum spectrum of a mixture of pions, kaons and\nprotons, plus a minimum bias generator on top for realistic background modeling.\nAbsolute hE/pi response. Fig. 3 shows the comparison of the average E/p responses between data and simulation based on the most recent tuning of the energy dependence of fdep , \u00ea/m\u0302 and \u0125/m\u0302. The basic idea is to adjust simultaneously the simulated\ntotal response (TOT) and the CHA response of MIP-like particles with CEM< 670 MeV\nusing in situ tracks up to 40 GeV, keeping the test beam tuning at higher energies. Indeed, the simulated TOT and MIP (top) as well as the CEM and CHA responses (bottom)\nagree quite well with the data. The total hE/pi in the central part, which serves as an important benchmark for the systematic jet energy scale uncertainties, is reproduced with\n1-2% precision within 0.5-40 GeV. The new tuning reflects more properly the current\ncondition of the CDF calorimeter, which includes aging effects of the photomultipliers,\nand partially replaces the former conservative test beam uncertainties of 4 %.\n\n\f1\n\n2000\n\n1\n\n\u03c72(CHA), 16-24 GeV/c\n\n3000\n2500\n\nQ\n\n2500\n\nQ\n\nQ\n\n\u03c72(CEM), 16-24 GeV/c\n\n\u03c72 combined\n\n80\n70\n\n1\n\n60\n2000\n50\n\n1500\n1500\n\n0.5\n\n1000\n\n0.5\n\n40\n\n0.5\n30\n\n1000\n\n20\n\n500\n\n500\n10\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n\u03b7\n\n0.4\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\nR1\n\n\u03c7 = 11.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\nR1= 0.18000\nQ= 0.27500\n\n0.1\n\nR1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n\u03c7 = 11.6\n\n2\n\nCEM\n\n0.4\n\n0\n\nR1= 0.18000\nQ= 0.27500\n\nCHA\n\n0.2\n\nR1\n\n\u03c7 = 4.9\n\n2\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n2\n\n0.8\n\nR1= 0.18000\nQ= 0.27500\n\nTOT\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n0.1\n\n0.2\n0.2\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\u03b7rel\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\u03b7rel\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\u03b7rel\n\nFIGURE 4.

An accurate adjustment of the hadronic lateral profile is important for\ntwo reasons. First, it controls the energy leakage out of the limited hE/pi signal regions.\nThus, any profile mismatch between simulation and data causes a bias when tuning the\nabsolute response. Second, leakage effects directly contribute to systematic uncertainties\ndue to the correction of jet energies for the energy flow out of a jet cone [8].\nFor the tuning, an experimental profile is defined using the individual hE/pi responses\nof five 1\u00d73 tower strips consecutive in \u03b7 , versus a relative \u03b7 coordinate normalized to\nthe \u03b7 of the target tower boundaries (\u03b7 = 0 denoting the center of the target tower). The\navailability of large single isolated track samples allows a straightforward systematic\napproach: In Eq. (7), the constant R1 denotes the shower core, while Q \u2261 R2 \u2212 R3 ln Einc\nfixes how the profile evolves with shower depth and incident particle energy. Since the\nelectromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter compartments probe different stages of the\naverage shower development, R1 and Q can be constrained using the profiles measured\nin the individual calorimeter compartments. The top of Fig. 4 shows a comparison of\n16-24 GeV profiles between data and simulation in terms of a standard \u03c7 2 estimator.\nCHA and CEM provide different contours of preferred parameter values, which helps to\nresolve the ambiguity due to the strong anti-correlation of R1 and Q by using a combination of both (top right). Generally a good agreement between data and simulation is\nobtained (bottom). Thus, R1 has been fixed from 0.5 to 40 (20) GeV in the central (plug)\ncalorimeter, and R2 and R3 can be extracted from the linear energy dependence of Q.\n\n\f7. ELECTROMAGNETIC RESPONSE\nThe tuning of electromagnetic showers in GFLASH presents less difficulty and is, although important, not detailed in this report. The simulated electromagnetic scale, which\nhas been set using electron test beam data, was validated in Run II at low momenta using\nelectrons from J/\u03c8 decays and at high momenta using electrons from W /Z decays. The\nsimulation reproduces the measured hE/pi response with a precision of 1.7%. The uncertainty is dominated by a contribution of 1.6% due to electrons pointing at the cracks\nbetween the towers, whereas electrons well contained in the target tower account for less\nthan 1% [8]. The crack response is complicated due to the presence of instrumentation\n(e.g. wavelength shifter) but can be monitored using electron pairs from Z decays. One\nelectron leg is required to be well contained within a target tower and serves as an energy\nreference, the other leg is used as probe to scan the hE/pi profile along the tower up to\nthe crack. The description of the crack response in GFLASH has thus been improved\nusing a correction function applied to the lateral profile mapping of energy spots.\n\n8. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK\nGFLASH has been tuned to reproduce the average hadronic response in the CDF central\ncalorimeter with a precision of 1-2% within the energy range 0.5-40 GeV/c. The electron\nresponse is reproduced with similar precision. An in situ tuning technique developed and\nre-fined in Run II has proved to be crucial to overcome past and current performance\nlimits. GFLASH might also be a promising simulation tool for LHC experiments. It is\nmore flexible than GEANT, it is tunable, and it demonstrates excellent CPU performance.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe main author would like to thank the German Max Planck Society and the Alexander\nvon Humboldt Foundation for their support, and is grateful to the members of the\nCDF simulation group, in particular S.Y.
