For a given quiver Q it is thus desirable\nto decide if the cluster algebra defined by Q is acyclic. We call Q cluster-acyclic in this\ncase, otherwise cluster-cyclic. In this note we classify the cluster-cyclic quivers with three\nvertices using a Diophantine equation studied by Markov.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nCluster algebras have been introduced and studied by Fomin and Zelevinsky in [5, 6]. In [2] it\nis shown that each acyclic cluster algebra admits an interpretation in terms of tilting objects\nin a so-called cluster category. This category is a Calabi-Yau category defined as a quotient\nof the derived category of modules over some hereditary algebra. It is thus desirable to study\nwhich cluster algebras are acyclic and which are not. While it has been shown in [6] that all\nfinite cluster algebras are acyclic, the general case is not known.\nThe first non-trivial situation is that of cluster algebras of rank three. This case has recently\nbeen studied in [8] (which analyzes properties of the acyclic case by representation-theoretic\nmethods) and in [1] (which describes the mutation classes of non acyclic cluster algebras).\nThe cluster algebras considered here are defined by a quiver Q; the quiver Q corresponds to\na skew-symmetric matrix B. In general, a cluster algebra is given by a skew-symmetrizable\nmatrix. In this paper we give precise criteria for deciding which quivers with three vertices\nyield an acyclic cluster algebra (Theorem 1.1) and which do not (Theorem 1.2).\nWe consider a quiver Q with three vertices 1, 2 and 3 and cyclic orientation. We assume Q\nhas x arrows from 1 to 2, y arrows from 2 to 3 and z arrows from 3 to 1:\n1\n\n\f2\n\nx\n\n1o\n\n@ 2 >>\n>>y\n>>\n>\u001e\nz\n\n3\n\nAn essential tool in the definition of a cluster algebra is the mutation of a quiver. We describe\nthe effect of these cluster mutations on the cyclic quiver Q. A cluster mutation in the vertex\n2 defines a new quiver \u03bc2 Q which is obtained from Q by reversing all arrows from 1 to 2 and\nfrom 2 to 3. Moreover, the quiver \u03bc2 Q has z \u2212 xy arrows from 3 to 1, provided this number\nis non-negative. Then the quiver \u03bc2 Q is no longer cyclic, it is acyclic. If z \u2212 xy is negative,\nthen \u03bc2 Q has xy \u2212 z arrows from 1 to 3 and it is cyclic:\n\nx\n\n1o\n\n2 ^>\n\n>> y\n>>\n>>\n\nz\u2212xy\n\nx\n\n3\n\n1\n\n2 ^>\n\n>> y\n>>\n>>\n/3\n\nxy\u2212z\n\nThe cluster mutations \u03bc1 Q and \u03bc3 Q in the vertices 1 and 3 are defined analogously. We say\nthat Q is cluster-acyclic if there exists a finite sequence of cluster mutations from Q to an\nacyclic quiver Q\u2032 . Otherwise, if all sequences of cluster mutations yield cyclic quivers, we say\nthat Q is cluster-cyclic. Of course, these cluster mutations are compatible with permutations\nof the triple (x, y, z) defining the cyclic quiver Q. So we say that a triple of non-negative\nintegers (x, y, z) is cluster-acyclic (respectively, cluster-cyclic) if the corresponding quiver Q\nhas this property.\nIn this note, we characterize cluster-cyclic quivers in terms of a Diophantine equation first\nstudied by Markov in [10]. For each triple (x, y, z), we define its Markov constant as\nC(x, y, z) := x2 + y 2 + z 2 \u2212 xyz.\nIt turns out that, with some exceptions, the value of the Markov constant characterizes\ncluster-acyclic quivers. We first note that C(x, y, z) is invariant under cluster mutations\n(Lemma 3.1). We consider the action of the group \u0393 on R3 , where \u0393 is generated by the\nthree cluster mutations \u03bc1 , \u03bc2 and \u03bc3 and all permutations in S3 . For each C \u2208 R, this group\naction reduces to an action on the affine algebraic variety\nV (C) := {(x, y, z) \u2208 A3 | C(x, y, z) = C}.\nWe are mainly interested in the integral points of V (C), but will also consider it over R and\nover C. Moreover, for x, y \u2265 2, we define two functions\nm\u2212 (x, y) :=\n\np\np\n1\n1\n(xy \u2212 (x2 \u2212 4)(y 2 \u2212 4)) and m+ (x, y) := (xy + (x2 \u2212 4)(y 2 \u2212 4)),\n2\n2\n\nwhere m+ (x, y) \u2265 m\u2212 (x, y) \u2265 2 for all x, y \u2265 2. If we consider a point in V (4) and express z\nas a function of x and y, then we obtain the two solutions z = m+ (x, y) and z = m\u2212 (x, y).\nMoreover, it is easy to check (using Lemma 3.1) that\nm+ (x, m\u2212 (x, y)) = m+ (x, xy \u2212 m+ (x, y)) = y = m\u2212 (x, m+ (x, y)) = m\u2212 (x, xy \u2212 m\u2212 (x, y)).\n\n\f3\nUsing these two functions and the Markov constant, we can characterize cluster-acyclic triples\nas follows. If the Markov constant is larger than 4, we have a cluster-acyclic triple; if the\nMarkov constant is less then 0, we have an cluster-cyclic triple. If the Markov constant lies\nin the interval [0, 4] then we have a finite number of cluster-acyclic triples for the Markov\nconstants 0, 1, 2, 4 corresponding to four finite orbits (see Theorem 1.1 (3) below) and an\ninfinite number of cluster-cyclic orbits (one contains one element, all others are infinite orbits)\nfor the Markov constants 0 and 4 (see Theorem 1.2). Also note that 4 is the only value of the\nMarkov constant with an infinite number of integral orbits; for all other values the number\nof orbits is finite (see Corollary 5.3).\nTheorem 1.1. Let Q be a cyclic quiver with numbers of arrows given by x, y, z in Z3\u22650 . Then\nthe following conditions are equivalent.\n(1) The triple (x, y, z) is cluster-acyclic.\n(2) The Markov constant satisfies C(x, y, z) > 4 or min{x, y, z} < 2.\n(3) The Markov constant satisfies C(x, y, z) > 4 or the triple (x, y, z) is in the following list\n(where we assume x \u2265 y \u2265 z):\na) C(x, y, z) = 0 : (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0),\nb) C(x, y, z) = 1 : (x, y, z) = (1, 0, 0),\nc) C(x, y, z) = 2 : (x, y, z) = (1, 1, 0) or (1, 1, 1),\nd) C(x, y, z) = 4 : (x, y, z) = (2, 0, 0) or (2, 1, 1).\n(4) min{x, y, z} < 2, or min{x, y} \u2265 2 and precisely one of the following inequalities is\nsatisfied: z > m+ (x, y) or z < m\u2212 (x, y).\nTheorem 1.2. Let Q be a cyclic quiver with numbers of arrows given by x, y, z in Z3\u22650 . Then\nthe following conditions are equivalent.\n(1) The triple (x, y, z) is cluster-cyclic.\n(2) x, y, z \u2265 2 and C(x, y, z) \u2264 4.\n(3) C(x, y, z) < 0 or the triple is in one of the followong orbits:\na) C(x, y, z) = 0 : (x, y, z) is in \u0393(3, 3, 3) or\nb) C(x, y, z) = 4 : (x, y, z) is in \u0393(2, x, x) for some x \u2265 2.\n(4) x, y, z \u2265 2 and m+ (x, y) \u2265 z \u2265 m\u2212 (x, y).\n(5) x, y, z \u2265 2 and in the orbit \u0393(x, y, z) there exists a unique element f (x, y, z) := (x\u2032 , y \u2032 , z \u2032 )\nsatisfying x\u2032 \u2265 y \u2032 \u2265 z \u2032 and y \u2032 z \u2032 \u2212 x\u2032 \u2265 x\u2032 .\nCorollary 1.3. (1) The list in Theorem 1.1, (3) together with the orbit of (x, 0, 0) (for x > 2)\nis the list of all finite cluster-acyclic orbits containing a triple with x \u2265 y \u2265 z \u2265 0.\n(2) The only finite cluster-cyclic orbit is (2, 2, 2).\nThe existence of two functions m+ and m\u2212 satisfying condition (4) in Theorem 1.2 has\nalready been shown in [1] without knowing the Markov equation. For more information on\nthe classical Markov equation we refer to [3] and to the original article of Markov [10]. This\nequation also appears in the work of Rudakov on vector bundles on P2 ([12]) and has known\napplications for mutations of exceptional sequences (see e. g. [7]). The Markov equation we\nstudy in this note differs slightly from the classical one: Markov constructed in [10] all integral\nsolutions of the equation\nx2 + y 2 + z 2 \u2212 3xyz = 0\nwhereas we consider a rescaled version (dividing all variables by 3) and allow arbitrary right\nhand side C (see section 6).\n\n\f4\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we define the group action we are interested\nin and prove some preliminary lemmata. This closely follows [3]. In Section 3, we explain how\nto obtain the Markov equation and show its invariance under cluster mutations. This is well\nknown for mutations of exceptional sequences (see [12]) and the classical Markov equation.\nWe consider the real points of the algebraic variety defined by the Markov equation (it is a\ndifferentiable manifold for C 6= 4) and compute its connected components in Section 4. It\nturns out that the group action respects the components. Moreover, we need to compute the\nsingularities. In Section 5 we construct a fundamental domain for the action of the group\n\u0393 on the set of all cluster-cyclic triples with real coefficients. Moreover, we show that the\nnumber of orbits for any given Markov constant C 6= 4 is finite. Finally, in Section 6 we prove\nour main theorems and the corollary.\nAknowledgment. This work was done during a visit of the third author in Sherbrooke.\nHe would like to take the opportunity to thank the second author for his invitation and the\nrepresentation theory group for the nice working conditons.\n\n2\n\nThe group action and mutations\n\nLet \u0393 be the group which is freely generated by three generators \u03bc1 , \u03bc2 , and \u03bc3 of order 2\n\n\u03bc1 : (x, y, z) 7\u2192 (yz \u2212 x, y, z),\n\n\u03bc2 : (x, y, z) 7\u2192 (x, xz \u2212 y, z),\n\n\u03bc3 : (x, y, z) 7\u2192 (x, y, xy \u2212 z)\n\nand let \u0393 the semi-direct product of \u0393 with the symmetric group S3 (see also below). It follows\nfrom Lemma 2.1 that \u0393 is the subgroup of \u0393 which is generated by all cluster mutations. Note\nthat \u0393 describes the cluster mutation as defined in [5] only when the quiver is cyclic. In case\nof an acyclic quiver, the cluster mutation is given by a different formula. Since we only want\nto decide whether a cyclic quiver is cluster-cyclic or not, it is sufficient to study the action of\n\u0393 (or \u0393) on Z3 (or on R3 ). A triple (x, y, z) is then cluster-acyclic precisely when there exists\na triple in the \u0393-orbit \u0393(x, y, z) with one non-positive entry.\nIn case there are more than 3 vertices, one could also derive a version of the Markov equation in\na manner similar to that described in Section 3. However, one then has to consider also acyclic\nquivers, and we see no way to make the group action and the Markov equation compatible\nwith cluster mutations on acyclic quivers.\nThe group \u0393 acts via cluster mutations on the three-dimensional affine space A3 defined over\nany commutative ring k. Moreover, the symmetric group S3 acts on \u0393 via permutation of the\ngenerators:\n\u03c3 * \u03bca(l) \u03bca(l\u22121) . . . \u03bca(2) \u03bca(1) := \u03bc\u03c3(a(l)) \u03bc\u03c3(a(l\u22121)) . . . \u03bc\u03c3(a(2)) \u03bc\u03c3(a(1))\n\nfor \u03c3 \u2208 S3 .\n\nThus \u0393 is the semi\u2013direct product of S3 with \u0393. In Section 5, we construct a fundamental\ndomain for the action of the group \u0393 on the set of all cluster-cyclic triples with Markov\nconstant less than 4. For the cluster-cyclic triples with C = 4, however, we cannot construct a\nfundamental domain. This is explained in detail in Section 4, when we compute the connected\ncomponents and the singularities of the sets V (C) over R.\n\n\f5\nIn this section, we only prove some first elementary properties of the group action. Note that\nthe cluster mutation \u03bci (x, y, z) changes only one of the three components x, y and z.\nSo we can define (x, y, z) \u2264 \u03bci (x, y, z) if all three components satisfy this inequality. It is a\npartial order on the set of all real triples (x, y, z). For us it is important that we can compare\n(x, y, z) with \u03bci (x, y, z) for all i = 1, 2, 3.\nWe distinguish the following three cases:\n(M1) (x, y, z) \u2264 \u03bci (x, y, z) for all i = 1, 2, 3,\n(M2) (x, y, z) \u2264 \u03bci (x, y, z) for precisely two indices i,\n(M3) (x, y, z) \u2264 \u03bci (x, y, z) for at most one index i.\nMoreover, for any triple with x \u2265 y \u2265 z the inequality xy \u2212 z < z already implies xz \u2212 y < y\nand xz \u2212 y < y implies yz \u2212 x < x.\nLemma 2.1. Consider three integers x, y, z \u2265 0.\na) If (x, y, z) 6= (0, 0, 0) satisfies (M1), then x, y, z \u2265 2 and the triple is cluster-cyclic. Moreover, in this case (x, y, z) is the unique triple in its \u0393-orbit satisfying conditon (M1) whereas\nall other triples in its \u0393\u2212orbit satisfy condition (M2).\nb) In the \u0393\u2212orbit of (x, y, z) there is either a unique triple satisfying (M1) or a triple satisfying (M3).\nc) If (x, y, z) satisfies (M3), then min{x, y, z} < 2, and the triple is cluster-acyclic.\nd) If (x, y, z) is a triple where one entry equals 2, then the triple is either cluster-acyclic or\nit is of the form (x, x, 2) with x \u2265 2.\ne) If (x, y, z) is a fixed point under the \u0393\u2212action, then either\nC(x, y, z) = 0 and (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0) or\nC(x, y, z) = 4 and (x, y, z) = (2, 2, 2).\nf ) The only element \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 acting trivially on A3 (Z) is the unit element.\nProof. Statement a) summarizes Markov's result from [10], see also [3]. A proof adapted to\nthe situation we consider here is given in [1] from which also most of the other statements can\nbe derived. We give here the main arguments, starting with part c) of the lemma. Assume\nthat the triple satisfies (M3) and suppose, without loss of generality, that x \u2265 y \u2265 z. Then\nyz \u2212 x < x and xz \u2212 y < y (this holds up to the action of S3 , then we use the assumpion\nx \u2265 y \u2265 z ) and thus z 2 y < 2xz < 4y and z 2 < 4. Consequently, z = 0 (the quiver is acyclic)\nor z = 1. In the second case, we apply the mutation (x, y, 1) 7\u2192 (y \u2212 x, y, 1) to obtain an\nacyclic quiver.\nTo prove a), assume now we start with a triple (x, y, z) satisfying (M1). Thus x, y, z \u2265 2,\notherwise we can mutate the triple to a smaller one. We start to mutate the triple as long\nwe get a triple satisfying (M2); the triples we obtain in each step away from (x, y, z) are\nthen larger or equal to their predecessors. Assume (x\u2032 , y \u2032 , z \u2032 ) is the first triple not satisfying\n(M2). Then it does not satisfy (M1), otherwise the previous one does not satisfy (M2). It also\ncan not satisfy (M3), since otherwise (using part c)) we got a triple with one entry smaller\nthan 2, but (x\u2032 , y \u2032 , z \u2032 ) \u2265 (x, y, z). One can think about all triples as the vertices of a graph,\nwhere each triples has at most three neighbours, the three mutated triples. This graph is also\nordered, that is, it defines a poset. Using this poset it is not difficult to see the properties we\nclaimed.\nThe uniqueness can also be shown as follows: Assume there are two triples in the \u0393\u2013orbit\n\n\f6\nsatisfying (M1). Then there exists a sequence of mutations from the first to the second. Along\nthis sequence there must be at least one triple which admits two smaller neighbours (use the\nposet as described above), thus it satisfies (M3). But this a contradiction to c).\nTo prove the first part of b) we note that we can always apply a mutation to obtain a smaller\ntriple unless the triple satisfies (M1). So, by applying a finite number of mutations, one\narrives either at a triple satisfying (M1) or one obtains a triple with some entry smaller than\n2, then some element in the orbit satisfies (M3).\nTo prove d) we consider the following sequence of mutations (where we assume x > y):\n(x, y, 2) 7\u2192 (2y \u2212 x, y, 2) 7\u2192 (2y \u2212 x, 3y \u2212 2x, 2) . . .\nAfter a finite number of steps ay \u2212 (a \u2212 1)x < 0, so the triple is cluster-acyclic.\nIf we have a fix point, then we are in case (M1), so z 2 x = 4x, y 2 z = 4z, and x2 y = 4y. So all\nvalues must be 0 or of absolute value 2. Then one checks all possible values explicitly.\nFinally we prove f). There exist triples with x > y > z satisfying (M1) (take for example\n(5, 4, 3)). Then for all elements \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393, we find \u03b3(x, y, z) 6= (x, y, z); otherwise we find an\nelement \u03b3 \u2032 (that is a subsequence of the mutations defining \u03b3) with \u03b3 \u2032 (x, y, z) satisfying (M3);\nwe use the same argument as in part a). This yields a contradiction to the uniqueness in part\nb).\n\u2737\n\n3\n\nThe Markov equation\n\nIn this section, we explain why the Markov constant is invariant under mutations. First, we\nrecall from [12] and [7] the appearance of the Markov equation from the study of exceptional\nsequences of vector bundles or modules, where one obtains a similar formula (for vector\nbundles on P2 the classical Markov equation appears). Note that exceptional sequences admit\na similar notion of mutation together with an action of the braid group. It turns out that\nfor exceptional sequences of length 3 the semidirect product of those mutations with the\nsymmetric group is isomorphic to \u0393.\nFor exceptional mutations (of exceptional sequences of length 3), one obtains the Markov\nconstant as follows. Consider the Cartan matrix D of the endomorphism ring of an exceptional\nsequence (E1 , E2 , E3 ). It has the form\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1 x y\nD := \uf8ed 0 1 z \uf8f8\n0 0 1\nwith integral entries x, y, z. Now compute its corresponding Coxeter matrix \u03a6, then the\nMarkov constant is the trace of \u03a6 up to a constant:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\u22121\n\u2217\n\u2217\n1 0 0\n1 \u2212x xz \u2212 y\n\uf8f8\n\u2217\n\u03a6 = \u2212D t D \u22121 = \u2212 \uf8ed x 1 0 \uf8f8 \uf8ed 0 1\n\u2212z \uf8f8 = \uf8ed \u2217 x2 \u2212 1\n2\n2\n\u2217\n\u2217\ny + z \u2212 xyz \u2212 1\ny z 1\n0 0\n1\nTr(\u03a6) = x2 + y 2 + z 2 \u2212 xyz \u2212 3.\nIt follows from tilting theory (see e. g. [11]) that the Coxeter matrices of two derived equivalent\nalgebras are conjugate, so, in particular, their traces are equal. Since the mutation of a full\n\n\f7\nstrongly exceptional sequence (it defines a tilting module as the direct sum of the elements of\nthe sequence) yields an endomorphism ring which is derived equivalent, the Markov constant\nmust be invariant under such mutations. This argument gives an explanation for why the\nMarkov constant occurs; the invariance itself can be checked directly:\nLemma 3.1. The Markov constant C(x, y, z) = x2 + y 2 + z 2 \u2212 xyz is invariant under all\ncluster mutations \u03bci for i = 1, 2, and 3 and invariant under the action of \u0393.\nProof. Obviously, the Markov constant is invariant under any permutation of the variables\nx, y, z. Then it is sufficient to check invariance under the transformation x 7\u2192 yz \u2212 x:\n(yz \u2212 x)2 + y 2 + z 2 \u2212 (yz \u2212 x)yz = x2 + y 2 + z 2 \u2212 xyz.\n\u2737\nFrom the Markov equation we get also the eigen values of the Coxter transformation. We\nfirst note that there exists always a largest real eigen value in the wild case (see [4]) or all\neigen values are roots of unity in the tame case. Moreover, the characteristic polynomial is\nsymmetric of degree three: T 3 + (C(x, y, z) \u2212 3)T 2 + (C(x, y, z) \u2212 3)T + 1 (see [9] and note\nthat the trace of \u03a6 is C(x, y, z) \u2212 3). All together we obtain the following result. Note that\nthe Markov constant already determines all eigen values. Moreover, all the exceptions in the\nmain theorems satisfy \u03bb is not real (\u03bb is not real precisely when 0 < C(x, y, z) < 4).\nLemma 3.2. The eigen values of the Coxeter transformation \u03a6 are \u22121, \u03bb, 1/\u03bb for some\nelement \u03bb satisfying either\n1) \u03bb is real with |\u03bb| \u2265 1 and then C(x, y, z) \u2265 4 or C(x, y, z) \u2264 0 or\n2) \u03bb is a complex number with |\u03bb| = 1 and then 0 \u2264 C(x, y, z) \u2264 4.\nFinally \u22121 + \u03bb + 1/\u03bb = C(x, y, z) \u2212 3.\nLemma 3.3. a) Assume a triple (x, y, z), with x, y, z \u2265 0, is cluster-acyclic, then C(x, y, z) >\n0 or C(x, y, z) = 0 and x, y, z = 0.\nb) Assume a triple (x, y, z) is cluster-cyclic, then C(x, y, z) < 4 or C(x, y, z) = 4 and the\ntriple is in the \u0393-orbit of (u, u, 2) for some u \u2265 2.\nProof. Assume a triple is cluster-acyclic, then there exists an element (x, y, z) in its orbit\nwith x, y \u2265 0 and z \u2264 0. Then, x2 \u2265 0, y 2 \u2265 0, z 2 \u2265 0, and \u2212xyz \u2265 0 and we get equality\nonly for (0, 0, 0). Assume the triple is cluster-cyclic, then we can assume x \u2265 y \u2265 z \u2265 2\nand yz \u2212 x \u2265 x (so that it is the unique element satisfying (M1), it is also the unique\nminimal element in the orbit, see Lemma 2.1). We consider z = 2. Then we obtain 2y \u2265 2x\nso x = y with C(x, x, 2) = 4. If z \u2265 3, then zy \u2265 2x. Now we assume x = y, then\nC(x, y, z) \u2264 2x2 + 9 \u2212 zx2 \u2264 0 with equality only for x, y, z = 3. If z \u2265 3 and zy = 2x,\n2\nthen C(x, y, z) = \u2212(( z4 \u2212 1)y 2 + z 2 ) < 0. Finally note that V (C)z (here we fix the value of\nz and consider V (C)z as an affine algebraic variety with coordinates x, y) is a hyperboloid,\nthus convex and C(x, y, z) is at most the value for x = y or for zy = 2x we computed above\n(all this is elementary computation, to see more details compare with the results in Section 4\nand the computation of the fundamental domain in Section 5).\n\u2737\nUsing Lemma 3.3 we have already proven Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.2 for all values C < 0\nand C > 4 (the details will be given later in Section 6). The remaining cases need some further\n\n\f8\ninvestigation, in particular, we need to determine the possible values of the Markov constant\nbetween 0 and 4. Finally, note that 4 is the maximal possible value of the Markov constant\nfor a cluster-cyclic triple. This and Lemma 2.1 a) explains why we obtain the functions m+\nand m\u2212 as solutions of the Markov equation for C = 4.\n\n4\n\nConnected components\n\nIn this section we consider the Markov equation over the real numbers and compute the slices\nV (C)z := {(x, y) \u2208 R2 | C(x, y, z) = C}\nfor a fixed value z. Then the Markov equation is quadratic in x and y and we consider the\nquadrics V (C)z for the various values of C and z. It turns out that V (C)z is an ellipsoid\nfor |z| < 2, a pair of lines for |z| = 2 and a hyperbola for |z| > 2 (it might be empty for\n|z| \u2264 2). Using the geometry of V (C)z we can easily determine the connected components\nand the singularities of V (C). It turns out that V (C) is smooth except for C = 4 (over\nC it also has a singularity for C = 0 in (0, 0, 0)). If C = 4 then it has the 4 singularities\n(2, 2, 2), (2, \u22122, \u22122), (\u22122, 2, \u22122), and (\u22122, \u22122, 2). Moreover, the \u0393-action respects the connected components. Since we have for 0 \u2264 C \u2264 4 five connected components in the smooth\npart V (C) \\ V (C)sing , one bounded and four unbounded, we obtain both cluster-cyclic and\ncluster-acyclic orbits over R. We finally classify these orbits over the integers, and obtain\nall orbits for 0 \u2264 C \u2264 4. The remaining values of C are easier to handle (Lemma 3.3). We\nalso note that it is convenient to work with the \u0393-action here since S3 permutes some of the\ncomponents, however it preserves all components contained in R3\u22650 .\nLemma 4.1. We fix z and consider the restricted action induced by the mutations (x, y, z) 7\u2192\n(yz \u2212 x, y, z) and (x, y, z) 7\u2192 (x, xz \u2212 y, z).\na) If |z| < 2 then V (C)z is an ellipsoid (hence bounded) and for generic x, y and z the \u0393-orbit\nis dense in V (C)z . In particular, there is no fundamental domain for the restricted action.\nMoreover, the set V (C)z is empty precisely when C < z 2 .\nb) If |z| = 2 then V (C)z consists of two lines for C > 4, of one line for C = 4 and is empty\nfor C < 4. If C = 4 then the restricted action is trivial, otherwise each generator interchanges\nthe two components and the composition of the two generators acts as a translation along the\nlines. A fundamental domain for the restricted action on the set {(x, y) \u2208 R2 | x 6= y} is\n{(x, y) \u2208 R2 \\ (0, 0) | y \u2264 2x, y \u2264 0}.\nc) If |z| > 2 then V (C)z is a hyperbola for C 6= z 2 . It is the union of two lines x = \u03bby and\nx = y/\u03bb for C = z 2 , where \u03bb + 1/\u03bb = z. For C < z 2 one component of V (C)z is contained\nin R2>0 , the other one in R2<0 . It turns out that each orbit is unbounded in this case. For the\nrestricted action we have a fundamental domain.\nproof. Assume |z| < 2, thus x2 +y 2 \u2212xyz \u2265 0 and C(x, y, z) = x2 +y 2 +z 2 \u2212xyz \u2265 z 2 . To see\nthat the \u0393-orbit is dense compute the eigenvalues of the linear transformation defined by the\ngenerators. If they are not rational the orbit must be dense. And since the coefficient of xy is\nsmaller than 2, the equation defines an ellipsoid. This shows a). To prove b) write the Markov\nequation as follows: C(x, y, z) = (x\u2212y)2 +4 = C. Thus V (C) is empty for C < 4 and for C = 4\nwe get one line, for C > 4 we get two lines. The action is generated by (x, y) 7\u2192 (2y \u2212 x, y)\n\n\f9\nand (x, y) 7\u2192 (x, 2x \u2212 y), and their composition is (x, y) 7\u2192 (2y \u2212 x, 3y \u2212 2x). This is a linear\naction preserving the orientation, so we only need to compute the image R\u22650 (\u22121, \u22122) of the\nline R\u22650 (1, 0) and a fundamental domain is the cone generated by these two rays. To prove\nc) we first compute the hyperboloids and the asymptotic lines. Finally, we can also use the\nlinearity of the action to get a fundamental domain.\n\u2737\nNow we use the previous result to get information on the action of \u0393 and the components.\nTheorem 4.2. Consider the action of \u0393 on V (C).\na) The set V (C) is a smooth manifold for all C 6= 4 and for C = 4 it has four cone singularities. Denote by V (C)smooth the open smooth part.\nb) The group \u0393 respects the connected components of V (C)smooth .\nc) The number of connected components depends on the value of C as follows:\n\nC<0\nC=0\n0<C<4\nC=4\nC>4\n\nconn. comp.\nof V (C)\n4\n5\n5\n1\n1\n\nconn. comp.\nof V (C)smooth\n4\n5\n5\n5\n1\n\ncompact\nconn. comp.\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n\nd) For C = 0 the compact connected component is the point (0, 0, 0). All compact connected\ncomponents are contained in [\u22122, 2]3 . All orbits in a non-compact connected component have\na sequence of elements that converges to infinity.\ne) All finite orbits are contained in the compact components or in the singular part.\nProof. We compute the singularities over C: consider the differential\n\u2202C(x, y, z)/\u2202x = 2x \u2212 yz.\nIt must vanish for any choice of the coordinate, thus\n2x = yz, 2y = xz, and 2z = xy yields 4x = y 2 x, 4y = z 2 y and 4z = x2 z.\nThen either x = 0 and z, y = 0 too, or |y| = 2 and |x| = |z| = 2, which yields the triples\n(2, 2, 2), (2, \u22122, \u22122), (\u22122, 2, \u22122), and (\u22122, \u22122, 2). Now we consider V (C) over R again. Since\n(0, 0, 0) is an isolated point in V (0) (consider the slices V (C)z we have already computed in\nthe previous lemma) it is not a singular point (over R). This proves a) and the first part of\nd). To show b) we note that the group acts via differentiable (in fact even algebraic) transformations, thus preserves the singularities. To finish the proof of b) we need to show c) first:\nAssume first C \u2265 4. Then V (C)z is never empty and connected for |z| < 2. Now vary z, then\nwe obtain a path from a point in V (C)z to each other slice V (C)z \u2032 . Thus V (C) is connected.\nAssume now 0 < C < 4. Consider 2 > |z| > 0. For z = 2 \u2212 \u03b5 and \u03b5 > 0 sufficiently small the\nvariety V (C)z is empty. On the other hand V (C)z is non-empty for z = 0 and |z| > 2. Playing\nthis with all three coordinates we get 5 connected components, one is contained in [\u22122, 2]3\nand is compact, the four others are contained in [2, \u221e]3 , [\u2212\u221e, \u22122] \u00d7 [\u2212\u221e, \u22122] \u00d7 [2, \u221e],\n\n\f10\n[\u2212\u221e, \u22122] \u00d7 [2, \u221e] \u00d7 [\u2212\u221e, \u22122], respectively [2, \u221e] \u00d7 [\u2212\u221e, \u22122] \u00d7 [\u2212\u221e, \u22122]. Note that no component can be contained in [\u2212\u221e, \u22122] \u00d7 [2, \u221e] \u00d7 [2, \u221e], since the Markov constant is at least\n4. If C < 0 the compact component vanishes and for C = 0 it is just the origin. If 0 \u2264 C \u2264 4\nthen we have both, a compact component and four unbounded components. The arguments\nare similar to the ones above. One considers the slices V (C)z for the various z and applies\nthe action of the symmetric group and the possible sign changes.\nNow we can finish the proof of b): since the five components for C < 4 (respectively the\ncomponents in the smooth part for C = 4) respect the inequality |z|, |y|, |z| \u2264 2 in two variables, they must respect it also in the third one by part c). Note that \u0393 (or any permutation)\ncan change signs and permutes three of the non-compact components, it only preserves the\ncompact component and the one in [2, \u221e]3 .\n\n5\n\nThe fundamental domain\n\nThe uniqueness in Lemma 2.1 a) suggests the existence of a fundamental domain for the \u0393action on the set of cluster-cyclic triples in R3 . We note that the uniqueness was proven only\nfor integral triples. Indeed, there exist real triples (they cannot be integral by Lemma 2.1)\nthat are cluster-cyclic and only have triples of type (M2) in their orbit. We will show that\nthose triples can only occur for the Markov constant 4. Thus for all real triples with fixed\nMarkov constant C there exists a unique triple satisfying (M1) only if the Markov constant\nis less than 4. Consequently, there should exist a fundamental domain for all cluster-acyclic\ntriples with Markov constant strictly less than 4. We define\nF := {(x, y, z) \u2208 R3 | x \u2265 y \u2265 z \u2265 2, yz \u2265 2x} and\nF \u25e6 := F \\ {(x, x, 2) | x \u2265 2} = {(x, y, z) \u2208 F | C(x, y, z) < 4}.\nUsing Lemma 3.3 we obtain C(F ) \u2286 (\u2212\u221e, 4] and C(F \u25e6 ) \u2286 (\u2212\u221e, 4), since the elements in F\nand F \u25e6 are cluster-acyclic and satisfy (M1).\nTheorem 5.1. a) Let (x, y, z) be a real cluster-cyclic triple. Then there exists a unique\ntriple f (x, y, z) in F that is in the closure (with respect to the ordinary topology) of the orbit\n\u0393(x, y, z). If the triple (x, y, z) is integral or of Markov constant strictly less than 4 then\nf (x, y, z) \u2208 F \u2229 \u0393(x, y, z).\nb) Consider the action of \u0393 on the set {(x, y, z) | x, y, z > 2; C(x, y, z) < 4}. Then F \u25e6 is\na fundamental domain for this action and the set S3 * F \u25e6 is a fundamental domain for the\n\u0393-action.\nProof. We first note that Lemma 2.1 a), c), d), e), and f) are also true for real triples.\nOnly b) might be not. We obtain, by the uniqueness, a fundamental domain for the action\non the set of all triples which do have a triple satisfying (M1) in their orbit. We show, it\nis already the fundamental domain as claimed above. Obviously, each element in F satisfies\n(M1). We need to show that \u0393F \u25e6 = {(x, y, z) | x, y, z > 2; C(x, y, z) < 4}. Take any triple in\n{(x, y, z) | x, y, z > 2; C(x, y, z) \u2264 4}. Now we start to mutate in the unique way, so that in\neach step we get a strictly smaller triple (using the partial order defined in Section 2). Assume\nwe got a smallest triple f (x, y, z), then it is an element in F (since all elements satisfying\n\n\f11\n(M1) are in F by definition). Assume there is not a minimal triple with Markov constant\nC < 4. Then the sequence of triples converges (it is decreasing and bounded below) and the\nlimit f (x, y, z) must be in F . If the triple f (x, y, z) is in the interior of F (this is F without\nits boundary) then a small ball around f (x, y, z) is also in F contradicting the fact that no\nelement of the convergent sequence is in F . A similar argument works if f (x, y, z) is in the\nboundary of F for C(x, y, z) = C(f (x, y, z)) < 4, take a small ball around the point f (x, y, z)\nwith all Markov constants strictly less than 4. Then we find that the ball around f (x, y, z) is\ncontained in S3 F \u222a \u03bc1 S3 F \u222a \u03bc2 S3 F \u222a \u03bc3 S3 F (one can see, that each of the elements \u03bci fixes\none of the boundaries.\n\u2737\nLemma 5.2. a) Assume (x, y, z) is in FZ . Then C(x, y, z) = 4, C(x, y, z) = 0 or C(x, y, z) <\n0.\nb) FZ \u2229 V (0) = {(3, 3, 3)}\nc) FZ \u2229 V (4) = {(x, x, 2) | x \u2208 Z\u22652 }.\nProof. We need to compute the maximal value of the Markov constant on the slices of the\nfundamental region Fz := {(x, y, z) \u2208 F } where we fix z (we show that only 4, 0 and negative\nvalues may occure). Since Fz is obviously bounded by lines, it is an intersection of affine half\nspaces, in particular it is convex. It is a little explicit computaton to see that the function\nC(x, y, z) takes its minimal value on the vertices of Fz , that is on (z, z, z) or on (z 2 /2, z, z).\nThe Markov constants are 3z 2 \u2212 z 3 = z 2 (3 \u2212 z) and \u2212z 4 /4 + 2z 2 = z 2 (2 \u2212 z 2 /4). Considering\nthe values for z = 2, 3, 4, . . . we obtain that the maximum is z 2 (3 \u2212 z) and it is in the critical\npart [0, 4] only for z = 2 or 3. Finally, we need to classify the orbits for C = 4, that is already\ndone using Lemma 3.3, and for C = 0. For C = 0 it is the classical Markov equation and\nthere are precisely two orbits: (0, 0, 0) (it is acyclic) and \u0393 * (3, 3, 3) = \u0393 * (3, 3, 3) (it is cyclic).\nFor convenience we repeat the arguments: assume C(x, y, z) = 0, considering the equation\nmodulo 3 shows that 3 divides each entry in the triple. Now use the fundamental region. If\nz \u2265 4 then there is no integral point in F with Markov constant 0. We can assume z = 3,\nsince z = 2 can not appear. Since C = 0 is the maximum on F3 all other elements in F\u22653\nmust have Markov constant strictly smaller than 0.\n\u2737\nCorollary 5.3. For each integer C 6= 4 the number of integral \u0393-orbits with Markov constant\nC is finite.\nProof. The same arguments (convexity and shape of Fz ) show that the set Fz \u2229 {(x, y, z) |\nC(x, y, z) \u2265 C} is bounded for any z and any C. Consequently, there are only finitely many\nlattice points in this set and there are only finitely many orbits. If the triple is cluster-acyclic\nwe consider the set of all acyclic triples with Markov constant C. This set is also finite, since\nthe equation\nx2 + y 2 + z 2 \u2212 xyz = C\nhas only finitely many integral solutions for x, y \u2265 0 and z \u2264 0.\n\n6\n\n\u2737\n\nProof of the Main Theorems\n\nIn this section we finally collect all the arguments for the proof of the two main theorems.\nSince the Markov constant C(x, y, z) is invariant under cluster mutation and permutation we\n\n\f12\ncan consider the various values of C case by case.\nAssume first C > 4 or C < 0. Then parts of the theorems follow from Lemma 3.3: in\nTheorem 1.1 (1), (2) and (3) are equivalent. Since m+ (x, y) = z or m\u2212 (x, y) = z precisely\nwhen C(x, y, z) = 4 we obtain m+ (x, y) < z or m\u2212 (x, y) > z precisely when C(x, y, z) > 4\nfor all x, y \u2265 2. Thus, under the assumption C(x, y, z) > 4 condition (1) is also equivalent\nto (4). Similar arguments work for Theorem 1.2 under the assumption C(x, y, z) < 0: we get\n(1) if and only if (2) and (3) by Lemma 3.3. The same argument as above and x, y, z \u2265 2\n(otherwise C(x, y, z) \u2265 0 by Lemma 4.1 a) and its proof) shows the equivalence with (4).\nFinally (5) is equivalent by Theorem 5.1 a).\nNow we consider C(x, y, z) = 0. Then we are in the case of the classical Markov equation\nX 2 + Y 2 + Z 2 \u2212 3XY Z = 0, where 3X = x, 3Y = y, 3Z = z.\nWe have already shown that each Markov triple is divisible by 3, so we can define new variables\nX, Y, Z and get a new equation as above. The solutions are well-known and the only orbits\nare (0, 0, 0) (it is cluster-acyclic) and \u0393(3, 3, 3) = \u0393(3, 3, 3) (it is cluster-cyclic and corresponds\nto the orbit of (1,1,1) for the classical Markov equation). Comparing with the statement in\nthe theorems finishes this case.\nNow we consider 0 < C(x, y, z) < 4. In this case there is no integral triple in the fundamental\ndomain F , thus all triples must be cluster-acyclic. Using the connected components we can,\ncase by case, classify all triples with x, y, z \u2264 2 explicitly (gives the list in Theorem 1.1 (3)\nand nothing in Theorem 1.2).\nFinally, we need to consider C(x, y, z) = 4. Again we classify all triples with x, y, z \u2264 2 (we\nobtain the two orbits in Theorem 1.1 (3) and one orbit in Theorem 1.2 (3).\n\nReferences\n[1] I. Assem, M. Blais, T. Br\u00fcstle, A.

The n vertices of Q are {1, . . . , n}. The set of arrows is\ndenoted by Q1 . If \u03b1 is an arrow, then s(\u03b1) denotes its starting point and t(\u03b1) its terminating\npoint. By ei we denote the primitive idempotent of H, corresponding to the vertex i.\nDenote by H1 (H) \u223c\n= Ext1H e (H, H) the first Hochschild cohomology group of H with coefficients\ne\nin H, where H is the envelopping algebra of H. It is shown in [2, 1.6] that dim H1 (H) can\nbe expressed as\nX\n\u03bd(\u03b1),\ndim H1 (H) = d \u2212 n +\n\u03b1\u2208Q1\n\nwhere d is the number of connected components of the quiver Q, and \u03bd(\u03b1) is the number of\npaths from s(\u03b1) to t(\u03b1) which means \u03bd(\u03b1) = dim et(\u03b1) Hes(\u03b1) .\nIt should be mentioned that, similar to the Markov constant, also dim H1 (H) is related to the\ntrace. of the Coxeter transformation of the hereditary algebra H, see for example [3, 3.2.1].\nLet C(x, y, z), with x, y, z > 0 be a cyclic quiver with three vertices\n\nx\n\n\u2712\n\n1 \u271b\n\n2\n\u2745 y\n\u2745\n\u2758\n\u2745\nz\n\n3\n\na\n\nwhere i \u2212\u2192 j means that there are a arrows from i to j.\nIf the cyclic quiver C(x, y, z) is mutation acyclic, then, after a finite sequence of mutations\none gets an acyclic quiver Q(r, s, t) of the form\n\nr\n1\n\n\u2712\n\n2\n\u2745 s\n\u2745\n\u2758\n\u2745\nt\n\u2732 3\n\nwith r, s > 0 and t \u2265 0. Hence C(x, y, z) is the quiver of a cluster tilted algebra \u0393 of type\nH = KQ(r, s, t), see for example [1]. In this case one has:\nTheorem If C(x, y, z) is the quiver of a cluster tilted algebra \u0393 of type H, where H is\nconnected hereditary of rank three, then\nC(x, y, z) \u2212 2 = dim H1 (H).\n\n\f15\nProof. Starting with the path algebra H of the quiver Q(r, s, t) one gets from Happel's result\nthe formula\ndim H1 (H) = r 2 + s2 + t2 + rst \u2212 2.\n\nMutation at the vertex 2 of the quiver Q(r, s, t) yields a cyclic quiver \u03bc2 Q(r, s, t) of the form\n\ns\n3 \u271b\n\n\u2712\n\n2\n\n\u2745 r\n\u2745\n\u2758\nrs + t \u2745\n\n1\n\nBut the Markov constant of this cyclic quiver is\nC(t + rs, s, r) = (t + rs)2 + s2 + r 2 \u2212 (t + rs)rs = r 2 + s2 + t2 + rst,\nwhich proves the theorem, since the Markov constant is invariant under mutations, as long\nas the quiver is cyclic.\nRemark. Let C(x, y, z) be a fixed cyclic quiver, which is mutation acyclic, hence the quiver\nof a cluster tilted algebra \u0393. Using its Markov constant C(x, y, z) one can determine the finite\nlist of connected hereditary path-algebras H, with three vertices such that dim H1 (H) + 2 =\nC(x, y, z). \u0393 then is cluster tilted of tpe H, where H belongs to this list. The list can be quite\nbig, as the following example shows: Let H be the path algebra of a quiver of type Q(2, s, t).\nThen dim H1 (H) = 2 + (s + t)2 .\n\nReferences\n[1] A. Buan,R. Marsh and I.
