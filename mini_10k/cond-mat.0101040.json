This signals an unusually strong anisotropy of \u223c 10% of the isotropic\nHeisenberg superexchange in the Cu-O chains of this compound. The strong\nanisotropy can be explained by the specific geometry of two symmetrical 90\u25e6\nCu-O-Cu bonds, which boosts the importance of orbital degrees of freedom.\nOur data show the apparent limitations of the applicability of an isotropic\nHeisenberg model to the low dimensional cuprates.\nPACS numbers: 76.30.-v, 71.27.+a, 71.70.Gm, 75.40.Gb\n\nTypeset using REVTEX\n1\n\n\fMagnetic interactions in strongly correlated transition metal oxides have attracted much\ninterest during the past decade due to their intimate relationship with high temperature\nsuperconductivity in the cuprates, but also in connection with novel quantum magnetic\nphenomena in spin-chain and spin-ladder materials. The superexchange interaction between\nmagnetic ions in oxides is mediated via oxygen ligands and is described by the Hamiltonian\nH = Jiso\n\nX\nij\n\nSi Sj +\n\nX\n\ndij [Si \u00d7 Sj ] +\n\nX\n\nSi Aij Sj ,\n\n(1)\n\nij\n\nij\n\nwhere the first term denotes the isotropic Heisenberg exchange, and the second and third\nrepresent antisymmetric and symmetric anisotropic contributions caused by spin-orbit coupling. In the case of a Cu2+ ion with a single hole with S=1/2 in the 3d shell, the orbital\nangular momentum is quenched in the solid due to crystal field splitting. In general spinorbit coupling and the corresponding anisotropies play only a minor role in cuprates. For\ninstance the CuO2 planes of the parent compounds of high temperature superconductors like\nLa2 CuO4 or Sr2 CuO2 Cl2 are thought to be the best representatives of a 2D S=1/2 square\nlattice isotropic Heisenberg antiferromagnet with Jiso \u2248 1500 K. This large value of Jiso is\ntypical for the 180\u25e6 Cu-O-Cu bond angle present in 2D cuprates. The anisotropic magnetic\ncouplings Aij \u226a| dij | both do not exceed 1% of Jiso in La2 CuO4 [1]. Nevertheless, this small\nanisotropy determines the orientation of spins with respect to the lattice in the magnetically\nordered state and is responsible for such remarkable phenomena as weak ferromagnetism or\nthe presence of spin wave gaps.\nAccording to the Goodenough-Kanamori-Anderson rules [2] the strength of the leading\nisotropic coupling Jiso can be considerably reduced by decreasing the Cu-O-Cu bond angle\nfrom 180\u25e6 to 90\u25e6 . In the case of a 180\u25e6 bond the antiferromagnetic (AF) coupling is mediated\nvia a single ligand orbital, whereas the exchange in a 90\u25e6 bond proceeds via orthogonal\norbitals (see Fig. 3) which are coupled via Hund's rule, resulting in a ferromagnetic coupling\n[3]. Experimentally, one still finds an AF Jiso \u2248 120 K [4] in the quasi-one-dimensional CuO chains of the spin-Peierls compound CuGeO3 with a bond angle \u223c 98\u25e6 . Still closer to\n90\u25e6 Jiso indeed changes sign and becomes ferromagnetic, as in La14\u2212x Cax Cu24 O41 [5]. The\n2\n\n\fdependence of the anisotropic corrections on the bond angle have not been studied to the\nsame extent. Recently, it has been predicted theoretically that the magnetic anisotropy of\ntwo symmetrical 90\u25e6 Cu-O-Cu bonds may be unusually large [6,7]. This bonding geometry\narises if Cu-O plaquettes (i.e. four oxygens forming a square with a Cu ion at the center)\nare connected along their edges and is found in several systems like La14\u2212x Cax Cu24 O41 [8],\nLi2 CuO2 [9] or Ca2 Y2 Cu5 O10 [10].\nElectron spin resonance (ESR) is a very sensitive tool to study the anisotropy of the spinspin coupling which, in particular, is the main source of the finite width \u2206H of an ESR signal\nin concentrated paramagnets [11]. In this paper we present ESR data of La14\u2212x Cax Cu24 O41\n(LCCO) single crystals, which show a very broad Cu2+ ESR signal of \u2206H \u223c 1500\u22122000 Oe\nfrom the Cu-O chains in the paramagnetic regime at T > 60 K. Our analysis shows that the\nobserved width of the ESR signal requires an unusually large anisotropic coupling of about\n10% of the leading isotropic exchange Jiso. This cannot be explained by conventional estimates of the dipole-dipole or anisotropic exchange interactions which neglect the geometry.\nThe data thus give evidence for a significantly enhanced contribution of spin-orbit coupling\nto the magnetism of copper oxides in certain bonding geometries.\nESR measurements were carried out at a frequency of 9.47 GHz.\n\nThe magnetic\n\nsusceptibility \u03c7static was measured with a SQUID-magnetometer at a field of 1 Tesla.\nLa14\u2212x Cax Cu24 O41 single crystals with x=9, 11 and 12 were grown by the travelling solvent floating zone method [12]. Their single phase structure and stoichiometry have been\nverified by x-ray, energy dispersive x-ray and thermogravimetric analyses. The Ca content\ndetermines the average oxidation state of Cu2+\u03b4 . The average number of holes per Cu site\nincreases from \u03b4 \u2248 0.04 for x=9 to \u03b4 \u2248 0.17 for x=12. The chains of edge-sharing Cu-O\nplaquettes are parallel to the c-axis and lie in one crystallographic plane (ac-plane). The\nexchange interaction in the chains is found to be small and ferromagnetic (Jiso \u2248 \u221220 K\n[5]), as expected for the nearly 90\u25e6 Cu-O-Cu bond angle. Additionally, La14\u2212x Cax Cu24 O41\ncontains planes of Cu2 O3 two-leg spin ladders running parallel to the chains [8]. The ladders\nshow a spin-singlet ground state with a spin gap of the order of 500-600 K [13,14].\n3\n\n\fRepresentative ESR spectra of the sample with x=9 and the fitting curves are shown in\nthe left panels of Fig. 1 at T = 100 and 14 K. Since the width of the signal \u2206H is comparable\nto the value of the resonance field Hres , the fitting function f (H) has to include Lorentzian\nabsorption derivatives corresponding to both, right and left circularly polarized components\nA(H+ ) and A(H\u2212 ) of the linearly polarized microwave field [11]. Moreover, we add to f (H)\nthe correction due to the non-diagonal contributions to the dynamic susceptibility which\nappears as an admixture of the Lorentzian dispersion D(H+ ) [15]:\nf (H) = A(H+ ) + A(H\u2212 ) + D(H+ ) ,\nA(H\u00b1 ) = \u2212\n\n(2)\n\n3d(3\u2212h2\u00b1 )\n16ah\u00b1\n,\nD(H\n)\n=\n.\n\u00b1\n(3+h2\u00b1 )2\n(3+h2\u00b1)2\n\nHere, h\u00b1 = 2(H \u2213 Hres )/\u2206H, and a and d (< a) are the amplitudes of the Lorentzian\nabsorption and dispersion signals, respectively. From this fit we obtain the values of Hres ,\n\u2206H and the integrated intensity I of the ESR line. The temperature dependence of these\nquantities for H k c [16] is shown in Figs. 1 (right panel) and 2. From the dependence\nof Hres on the orientation of the magnetic field we derive g-factors of gc = 2.02 \u00b1 0.02 and\ngb = 2.30\u00b10.05 [17], which are typical for Cu2+ ions in a four-fold square oxygen coordination\n[11].\nIn the paramagnetic regime, the ESR intensity I(T ) is per definition proportional to the\nspin\nstatic susceptibility of the resonating spins \u03c7spin\nESR [11]. In order to obtain \u03c7ESR in absolute\n\nunits we have calibrated I(T ) of the samples at T = 100 K against the intensity of the\nsimultaneously measured spectrum of the standard reference material Al2 O3 + 0.03%Cr3+\n(the latter spectrum is visible in the top left panel of Fig. 1 as three small background lines\nat 840, 3340 and 7740 Oe). The T dependences of \u03c7spin\nESR and \u03c7static are very similar for\n< 30 K are related to a transition\nT > 30 K (right panel of Fig. 1). The deviations at T \u223c\nto a long range ordered AF state (see below). For 50 K < T < 300 K, \u03c7static in LCCO is\nentirely described in terms of weakly interacting Cu-O spin chains, the contribution from\nthe ladders is negligible due to their large spin gap [5]. From the similarity between \u03c7spin\nESR\nand \u03c7static we therefore conclude that the ESR spectrum can be ascribed solely to the Cu\n4\n\n\fspins in the chains.\nThe ESR line width in magnetic insulators is usually decomposed into non-critical and\ncritical parts [20]:\n\u2206H = \u2206H(\u221e) + \u2206Hcrit (T ).\n\n(3)\n\nThe first term in Eq. 3 is determined by spin-spin interactions at high temperatures, where\nspins are uncorrelated (paramagnetic regime). The second term \u2206Hcrit (T ) defines an additional contribution to the line width which arises at low temperatures, when long-range\nmagnetic order is approached. It is caused by the fluctuations of the staggered magnetization\nin the short-range ordered state. These enhance the rate of the spin-spin relaxation 1/T2\nand consequently broaden the ESR line additionally [20]. According to the analysis of \u03c7static\nin Ref. [5], insulating LCCO is paramagnetic above 50 K, whereas at lower temperatures\nspin correlations grow and finally result in long range AF order, which has been observed in\nLa5 Ca9 Cu24 O41 at TN \u2248 10 K [19,21]. Indeed, both the considerable shift of Hres to higher\nfields and the broadening of the ESR line at T < 60 K (see Fig. 2) are obviously due to the\ndevelopment of short-range magnetic order (\u2206Hcrit (T ) in Eq. 3) [22]. The intensity of the\nESR signal drops rapidly already above TN due to the growth of short-range AF ordered\nregions. Most of the spins within these regions do not contribute to the ESR spectrum\nsince their resonance frequency is outside the range of our spectrometer. This explains the\ndiscrepancy between \u03c7spin\nESR and \u03c7static at low T (right panel of Fig. 1). With increasing Ca\ncontent the critical behavior of the ESR response gets less pronounced thus giving evidence\nfor a rapid suppression of AF correlations in LCCO by hole doping.\nThe main concern of the present paper is the large value of \u2206H(T ) of about 15002000 Oe for temperatures far away from the magnetically ordered state (see Fig. 2). It is\nreasonable to assume that the almost T -independent ESR line width in the paramagnetic\nregime above 60-80 K is determined by the Cu spin-spin interactions, i.e. by \u2206H(\u221e) in\nEq.3 [23]. Magnetic resonance in paramagnetic insulators is usually discussed in terms of\nthe \"moments\" of a Gaussian absorption line [11]. In particular, \u2206H(\u221e) is proportional\n5\n\n\fto the second moment M2 , which is determined only by various anisotropic interactions\nbetween spins. On the other hand, the isotropic Heisenberg exchange interaction Jiso\n\nP\n\nSi Sj\n\ninfluences the shape of the line via the well known effect of \"exchange narrowing\" of the\n> \u2206H. In this case the ESR\nmagnetic resonance which takes place if |Jiso | /g\u03bcB \u226b Hres \u223c\nsignal acquires a Lorentzian line shape, which is indeed observed in LCCO (see Fig. 1). The\ncorresponding \"exchange narrowed\" line width reads [24,25]:\n\u2206H(\u221e) \u2243\n\nh\u03042 M2\n.\ng\u03bcB |Jiso|\n\n(4)\n\nThe most obvious anisotropic interaction which broadens the resonance line is a dipoledipole interaction between the spins Si and Sj separated by a distance rij : Hdd =\ng 2 \u03bc2B\n\nP\n\nij\n\nrij\u22123 [Si Sj \u2212 3rij\u22122 (Si rij )(Sj rij )]. This yields an exchange narrowed dipole-dipole con-\n\ntribution to the width of \u2206H dd \u2248 1 Oe, which is negligible compared to the experimental\nresult.\nNow we focus on the contributions to \u2206H arising from the anisotropy of exchange (last\ntwo terms in Eq. 1). The term\n\nP\n\nij\n\ndij [Si \u00d7Sj ] is known as the antisymmetric Dzyaloshinsky-\n\nMoriya (DM) interaction [28,29]. However, in LCCO the DM vector dij is zero due to the\npresence of an inversion center between two nearest neighbor Cu sites [8]. The only possible\nsource of the large \u2206H in LCCO is hence the symmetric anisotropic exchange\n\nP\n\nij\n\nSi Aij Sj .\n\nIn this case M2 \u2243 A2ij [11]. With the observed value of \u2206H \u2248 1500 Oe and Jiso \u2248 20 K [5]\nwe get from Eq. 4 a surprisingly strong anisotropy Aij of about 10% of Jiso . This value of\nAij is ten times larger than the conventional estimate [28] Aconv\n\u2243 (\u2206g/g)2Jiso \u2248 1% of Jiso,\nij\nwhere \u2206g \u2248 0.2 is the average deviation of the g-factor of Cu2+ in LCCO from its spin-only\nvalue g=2. In terms of experimentally accessible quantities, the conventional estimate yields\n\u2206H \u2248 15 Oe, whereas the experimental result is two orders of magnitude larger.\nIn the following we discuss the basic physics that may cause such an unusually strong\nanisotropy of superexchange in LCCO [6,7]. For a qualitative understanding it is sufficient\nto consider only two nearest neighbor Cu ions, CuL and CuR in the Cu-O chain (see Fig. 3).\nIn perturbation theory, the superexchange interaction arises from virtual hopping processes\n6\n\n\fvia the two intermediate oxygen ligands (A and B), which couple the Cu spins by 90\u25e6 bonds.\nIn hole notation oxygen orbitals are empty. The crystal field splits the 3d9 state of a Cu2+\nion, and the lowest orbital dx2 \u2212y2 is non-degenerate and singly occupied. Only the twofold\nKramers spin degeneracy remains in the ground state. However, a finite spin-orbit coupling\n\u03bbL*S couples the |x2 \u2212y 2> state with the orbital states |xy>, |yz> and |zx>. The central\npoint is that the relevance of these orbitals for superexchange depends on the geometry of\nthe considered bond. In case of a 180\u25e6 bond directed e.g. along the x-axis with a single\noxygen ligand at the midpoint between the two Cu sites, the symmetry and the contribution\nof the |xy, CuL> and |zx, CuL> states are identical with respect to the Cu-O-Cu bond. In\nthe present case, on the other hand, exchange processes involving virtual hopping of the\nhole from the |x2 \u2212y 2> ground state to the |xy> orbital are strongly enhanced with respect\nto the exchange via |yz > and |zx > states. This strong anisotropy in orbital space is\ndirectly translated into a strong anisotropy in spin space via spin-orbit coupling. A strong\nferromagnetic coupling arises e.g. due to virtual hopping processes via |xy, CuL > into the\n|px,A > and |py,B > ligand states. The hopping process takes the form of \"ring exchange\"\nwhich avoids unfavorable doubly occupied sites by involving the excitations along the ring\nCuL \u2192 OA \u2192 CuR \u2192 OB \u2192 CuL [7]. The predominant contribution of the |xy > orbital\nto superexchange causes an easy-axis out-of-plane anisotropy. In the present geometry this\nanisotropy, as compared to a 180\u25e6 bond, is additionally enhanced due to a strongly reduced\nisotropic superexchange between |x2 \u2212y 2 , CuL > and |x2 \u2212y 2 , CuR >, which may be reduced\nfurthermore for bond angles slightly larger than 90\u25e6 because of a cancellation of the leading\norder ferro- and antiferromagnetic contributions to the isotropic exchange [7].\nOur ESR data clearly show that the spin dynamics of the Cu-O chains of LCCO is\ngoverned by a strong anisotropy of the magnetic interactions in the paramagnetic regime.\nIn this respect LCCO may not be unique. For instance, in Li2 CuO2 a surprisingly broad\nESR signal (\u2206H\u223c 4000 Oe) has been reported in the submillimeter wavelength range [30].\nComplementary to our result, specific heat measurements of La5 Ca9 Cu24 O41 in a magnetic\nfield reveal a strong magnetic anisotropy in the AF ordered state at low T , suggesting even\n7\n\n\fan Ising-like character of the magnetism of the chains [19]. Moreover, our analysis is in\nagreement with the recent observations of a large spin-wave gap in Li2 CuO2 [31] and of a\nlarge size of the ordered moment in Ca2 Y2 Cu5 O10 [10], which both point towards a strong\neasy-axis anisotropy of edge-sharing Cu-O plaquettes.\nIn summary, a very broad ESR absorption line of Cu2+ ions in the chains of\nLa14\u2212x Cax Cu24 O41 single crystals is observed in the paramagnetic regime. Our analysis\nreveals that the line width is two orders of magnitude larger than one expects from conventional estimates of the anisotropy of the magnetic exchange interaction. This gives strong\nexperimental evidence for a significant amplification of the influence of spin-orbit coupling\non magnetic superexchange in edge-sharing Cu-O structures, as suggested recently by theoretical calculations [6,7]. The commonly accepted point of view on copper oxides as good\nmodel systems for studies of the isotropic Heisenberg spin magnetism has thus to be revised\nfor certain bonding geometries.\nWe gratefully acknowledge useful discussions with G.A.

[24] and the\ntext). The value of \u2206H is thus nearly twice as large for H k b than for H k c. We therefore\nrestrict ourselves to the discussion of the parameters for H k c, which can be determined\nmore accurately.\n[17] These values were obtained for T between 80 and 150 K, where Hres is not affected\nby the low temperature AF spin correlations. Above 150 K the uncertainty and the\nsystematic error in the determination of Hres considerably increase due to the reduced\namplitude of the signal.\n[18] Although I and \u03c7static were measured at different fields (\u223c 0.3 and 1 Tesla, respectively),\n> 25 K and\ntheir comparison is reasonable because \u03c7static is field independent for T \u223c\n0 < H \u2264 14 T [19].\n[19] U.

Boucher, in Magnetic properties of layered transition metal compounds, ed. by L.J. de Jongh (Dordrecht; Boston: Kluwer Academic, 1990.), p.323.\n[23] We consider sample inhomogeneities as a rather improbable source of the broadening\nof the ESR signal. In principal, structural disorder may cause local deviations of the gfactors of the Cu ions from their mean values gb and gc . However, the observed linewidth\nwould require a spread of the g-factors of the order \u2206g \u223c \u00b10.5, which is unrealistic.\nIn the case of magnetic inhomogeneity the broadening should be proportional to the\nmagnetization of the sample \u03c7(T )*H. Thus the linewidth would decrease with increasing\ntemperature which is not observed in the experiment. Moreover in both cases one expects\n\n10\n\n\frather a Gaussian and not a Lorentzian line profile, but the former does not describe\nour data.\n[24] R. Kubo, K. Tomita, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 9, 888 (1954).\n[25] In principal, the effect of exchange narrowing may be inhibited in one-dimensional\nsystems due to the slow diffusive decay of spin-spin correlations in the chains. In this case\none should observe a non-Lorentzian line shape and a specific angular dependence of \u2206H\nlike, e.g., |3 cos2 \u03b8 \u2212 1|4/3 [26]. However, this is in drastic contrast to our experimental\nobservation of a Lorentzian line profile as well as of the (1 + cos2 (\u03b8)) dependence of\n\u2206H, both typical for the usual exchange narrowing in three dimensions. In view of the\nrelatively high ordering temperature TN \u2248 10 K which reflects the appreciable interchain\ncoupling Jinter this is not surprising. A conventional estimate of Jinter from TN and Jiso\n(see, e.g., [27]) gives a value of several K. The rate of the out-of-chain diffusion of spin\ncorrelations which is of the order of Jinter /h\u0304 is thus much faster than the ESR frequency.\nHence on the ESR time scale the spin system behaves three dimensional, and the width\nof its ESR signal is determined by Eq. 4.\n[26] R.E.
