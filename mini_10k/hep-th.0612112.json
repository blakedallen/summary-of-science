In S O (1, 3) invariant theory new consequences of generalized\nHaag's theorem are obtained. It has been proven that the equality of\nfour-point Wightman functions in two theories leads to the equality of\nelastic scattering amplitudes and thus the total cross-sections in these\ntheories.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nQuantum field theory (QFT) as a mathematically rigorous and consistent theory\nwas formulated in the framework of the axiomatic approach in the works of\nWightman, Jost, Bogoliubov, Haag and others ([1] - [5]).\nWithin the framework of this theory on the basis of most general principles such as Poincar\u00e9 invariance, local commutativity and spectrality, a number\nof fundamental physical results, for example, the CPT-theorem and the spinstatistics theorem were proven [1] - [3].\nNoncommutative quantum field theory (NC QFT) being one of the generalizations of standard QFT has been intensively developed during the past years\n(for reviews, see [6, 7]). The idea of such a generalization of QFT ascends to\nHeisenberg and it was initially developed in Snyder's work [8]. The present development in this direction is connected with the construction of noncommutative geometry [9] and new physical arguments in favour of such a generalization\nof QFT [10]. Essential interest in NC QFT is also due the fact that in some\ncases it is a low-energy limit of string theory [11]. The simplest and at the\n\n1\n\n\fsame time most studied version of noncommutative field theory is based on the\nfollowing Heisenberg-like commutation relations between coordinates:\n[x\u0302\u03bc , x\u0302\u03bd ] = i \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd is a constant antisymmetric matrix.\nIt is known that the construction of NC QFT in a general case (\u03b80i 6= 0)\nmeets serious difficulties with unitarity and causality [13] - [16]. For this reason\nthe version with \u03b80i = 0 (space-space noncommutativity), in which there do\nnot appear such difficulties and which is a low-energy limit of the string theory,\ndraws special attention. Then always there is a system of coordinates, in which\nonly \u03b812 = \u2212\u03b821 6= 0. Thus, when \u03b80i = 0, without loss of generality it is\npossible to choose coordinates x0 and x3 as commutative and coordinates x1\nand x2 as noncommutative.\nThe relation (1) breaks the Lorentz invariance of the theory, while the symmetry under the SO (1, 1) \u00d7 SO (2) subgroup of the Lorentz group survives [15].\nTranslational invariance is still valid. Below we shall consider the theory to be\nSO (1, 1) invariant with respect to coordinates x0 and x3 . Besides these classical\ngroups of symmetry, in the paper [17] it was shown, that the noncommutative\nfield theory with the commutation relation (1) of the coordinates, and built according to the Weyl-Moyal correspondence, has also a quantum symmetry, i.e.\ntwisted Poincar\u00e9 invariance.\nIn the works [18] - [20] the Wightman approach was formulated for NC QFT.\nFor scalar fields the CPT theorem and the spin-statistics theorem were proven\nin the case \u03b80i = 0.\nIn [18] it was proposed that Wightman functions in the noncommutative\ncase can be written down in the standard form\nW (x1 , . . . , xn ) = h \u03a80 , \u03c6(x1 ) . . . \u03c6(xn ) \u03a80 i,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03a80 is the vacuum state. However, unlike the commutative case, these\nWightman functions are only SO (1, 1) \u2297 SO (2) invariant.\nIn [19] it was proposed that in the noncommutative case the usual product\nof operators in the Wightman functions be replaced by the Moyal-type product\n(see also [7]):\n\u0012\n\u0013\nY\ni \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\n\u2202\n\u03c6(x1 )\u22c6* * *\u22c6\u03c6(xn ) =\nexp\n\u03c6(x1 ) . . . \u03c6(xn ), a, b = 1, 2, . . . n.\n\u03b8\n2\n\u2202x\u03bca \u2202x\u03bdb\na<b\n\n(3)\nSuch a product of operators is compatible with the twisted Poincar\u00e9 invariance\nof the theory [21] and also reflects the natural physical assumption, that noncommutativity should change the product of operators not only in coinciding\npoints, but also in different ones. This follows also from another interpretation\nof NC QFT in terms of a quantum shift operator [22]. In [20] it was shown\nthat in the derivation of some axiomatic results, the concrete type of product\nof operators in various points is insignificant. It is essential only that from the\nappropriate spectral condition (see formula (9)), the analyticity of Wightman\n2\n\n\ffunctions with respect to the commutative variables x0 and x3 follows, while x1\nand x2 do not need to be complexified. The Wightman functions can be written\ndown as follows [20]:\nW \u0303\u22c6 (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) = h\u03a80 , \u03c6 (x1 )  \u0303\u22c6 * * *  \u0303\u22c6 \u03c6 (xn )\u03a80 i.\n\n(4)\n\nThe meaning of  \u0304\n\u22c6 depends on the considered case. In particular,\n\u03c6 (x) \u0303\n\u22c6\u03c6 (y) = \u03c6 (x)\u03c6 (y) according to [18]\nor\n!\n\u2192\n\u2190\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u2202\ni \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\n\u03c6 (x) \u0303\n\u03c6 (y) according to [19].\n\u03b8\n\u22c6\u03c6 (y) = \u03c6 (x) exp\n2\n\u2202x\u03bc \u2202y \u03bd\nNote that actually field operators are the smoothed operators\nZ\n\u03c6f \u2261\n\u03c6 (x) f (x) d x,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere f (x) are test functions. This point will be considered in details in Section\n2.\nIn [20] it was shown that, besides the above-mentioned theorems, in NC QFT\n(with \u03b80i = 0) a number of other classical results of the axiomatic theory remain\nvalid. In [21] on the basis of the twisted Poincar\u00e9 invariance of the theory the\nHaag's theorem was obtained [23, 24] (see also [1] and references therein).\nIn the present work, analogues of some known results of the axiomatic approach in quantum field theory are obtained for the S O (1, 1) invariant field\ntheory, of which an important example is NC QFT. In the S O (1, 3) invariant\ntheory new consequences of the generalized Haag's theorem are found, without\nanalogues in NC QFT. At the same time it is proven that the basic physical\nconclusion of Haag's theorem is valid also in the S O (1, 1) invariant theory, and\nit is sufficient that spectrality, local commutativity condition and translational\ninvariance be fulfilled only for the transformations concerning the commutating coordinates. The analysis of Haag's theorem reveals essential distinctions\nbetween commutative and noncommutative cases, more precisely between the\nS O (1, 3) and S O (1, 1) invariant theories. In the commutative case, the conditions (33) and (34), whose consequence is generalized Haag's theorem, lead\nto the equality of Wightman functions in two theories up to four-point ones.\nIn the present paper it is shown that in the S O (1, 1) invariant theory, unlike\nthe commutative case, only two-point Wightman functions are equal and it is\nshown that from the equality of two-point Wightman functions in two theories\nit follows that if in one of them the current is equal to zero, it is equal to zero\nin the other as well and under weaker conditions than the standard ones. It\nis also shown that for the derivation of eq. (34) it is sufficient to assume that\nthe vacuum vector is a unique normalized vector, invariant under translations\nalong the axis x3 ). It is proven that from the equality of four-point Wightman\nfunctions in two theories, the equality of their elastic scattering amplitudes follows and, owing to the optical theorem, the equality of total cross sections as\n3\n\n\fwell. In derivation of this result LCC is not used. In the noncommutative theory we also prove that classical results, such as the irreducibility of the set of\nfield operators, the theorems of Reeh and Schlieder [1] - [3] remain valid in the\nnoncommutative case. It should be emphasized that the results obtained in this\npaper do not depend on the S O (2) invariance of the theory in the variables x1\nand x2 and therefore can be extended to more general cases. The first theorem\nof Reeh and Schlieder and the irreducibility of the set of field operators remain\nvalid in any theory, in which the spectral condition (9) leads to the analyticity\nof the Wightman functions in the variables x0 and x3 in the primitive domains\nof analyticity (\"tubes\").\nThe study of Wightman functions leads still to new nontrivial consequences\nalso in the commutative case1 .\nThe paper is arranged as follows. In section 2 the necessary properties of\nWightman functions are formulated; in section 3 generalizations of the theorems\nof Reeh and Schlieder to NC QFT are obtained; in section 4 the irreducibility\nof the set of field operators is proven; section 5 is devoted to generalized Haag's\ntheorem; in section 6 it is shown that in the commutative case, the conditions\nof weak local commutativity (WLCC) and of local commutativity (LCC), which\nare valid in the noncommutative case ((18) and (19)), appear to be equivalent\nto the usual WLCC and LCC, respectively.\n\n2\n\nBasic Properties of Wightman Functions\n\nIn Wightman's approach cyclicity of the vacuum vector is assumed. In the noncommutative case this means that any vector of the space under consideration,\nJ, can be approximated with arbitrary accuracy by vectors of the type\n\u03c6f1  \u0303\u22c6 * * *  \u0303\u22c6 \u03c6fn \u03a80 ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere fi is a proper test function (5) and the  \u0303\u22c6 in (6) acts only on the test\nfunctions f1 , ...fn . For simplicity we consider the case of a real field, however,\nthe results are easily extended to a complex field. As well as in the commutative\ncase we assume that the domain of definition of operators \u03c6f is dense in J\nWe admit that the scalar product of two vectors \u03a6 = \u03c6fk  \u0303\u22c6 * * *  \u0303\u22c6 \u03c6f1 \u03a80 and\n\u22c6*** \u0303\n\u22c6 \u03c6fn is the following\n\u03a8 = \u03c6fk+1  \u0303\nh \u03a6, \u03a8 i = h \u03a80 , \u03c6f1  \u0303\u22c6 * * *  \u0303\u22c6 \u03c6fn \u03a80 i =\nZ\n\nW (x1 , . . . , xn ) f1 (x1 )  \u0303\u22c6 * * *  \u0303\u22c6 fn (xn ) d x1 . . . d xn .\n\n(7)\n\nFor reasons given below, it is important only that the scalar product of any\ntwo vectors in J can be approximated by linear combination of the scalar products of the type (7) with arbitrary precision. As noncommutativity does not\naffect the commutative variables we assume that noncommutative Wightman\n1 Part\n\nof the results have been presented in the talk [25].\n\n4\n\n\ffunctions after smearing on noncommutative variables are tempered distributions with respect to x0i and x3i . As to their properties with respect to noncommutative variables it is natural to assume, as it is done in various versions\nof nonlocal theories [26] - [28], that they belong to one of the Gel'fand-Shilov\nspaces [29]. This question will be considered in a paper which is in preparation.\nLet us stress that the concrete choice of Gel'fand-Shilov space is not important\nin the derivation of our results.\nLet us point out that the results of this work are new also in the case of the\nstandard multiplication of functions fi (xi ).\nFor the results obtained below, translational invariance only in commuting\ncoordinates is essential, therefore we write down the Wightman functions as:\nW (x1 , . . . , xn ) = W (\u03be1 , . . . , \u03ben\u22121 , X),\n\n(8)\n\nwhere X designates the set of noncommutative variables x1i , x2i , i = 1, . . . n, and\n\u03bej = {\u03bej0 , \u03bej3 }, where \u03bej0 = x0j \u2212 x0j+1 , \u03bej3 = x3j \u2212 x3j+1 , j = 1, ..., n \u2212 1.\nLet us formulate now the spectral condition. We assume that any vector\nin p space, belonging to the complete system of these vectors, is time-like with\nrespect to momentum components Pn0 and Pn3 , i.e. that\nPn0 \u2265 |Pn3 |.\n\n(9)\n\nThe condition (9) is conveniently written as Pn \u2208 V \u03042+ , where V \u03042+ is the set of\nthe four-dimensional vectors satisfying the condition P 0 \u2265 |P 3 |. Recall that the\nusual spectral condition for these vectors looks like Pn \u2208 V \u0304+ , i.e. Pn0 \u2265 |P~n |.\nFrom the condition (9) and the completeness of the system of the vectors \u03a8Pn :\nXZ\nh\u03a6, \u03a8i =\n(10)\nd Pn h\u03a6, \u03a8Pn ih\u03a8Pn , \u03a8i,\nn\n\nit follows that\n\nZ\n\nd a e\u2212i p a h\u03a6, U (a) \u03a8i = 0,\n\nif\n\np 6\u2208 V\u03042+ ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere a = {a0 , a3 } is a two-dimensional vector, U (a) is a translation in the\nplane p0 , p3 , and \u03a6 and \u03a8 are arbitrary vectors. The equality (11) is similar\nto the corresponding equality in the standard case ([1], Chap. 2.6). Let us\npoint out that in fact the complete system of vectors \u03a8Pn contains vectors with\ninfinite norms. But this point can be settled in the noncommutative case just\nas in commutative one [1]. The point is that noncommutativity does not affect\nthe momentum operators. So in momentum space the only difference between\ncommutative and noncommutative cases is the weaker spectral condition in the\nlatter case.\nA direct consequence of the equality (11) is the spectral property of Wightman functions:\nZ\n1\nei Pj \u03bej W (\u03be1 ..., \u03ben\u22121 , X) d \u03be1 ...d \u03ben\u22121 = 0,\nW (P1 ..., Pn\u22121 , X) =\n(2\u03c0)n\u22121\n(12)\n5\n\n\fif Pj 6\u2208 V\u03042+ . The proof of the equality ( 12) is similar to the proof of the spectral\ncondition in the commutative case [1], [3]. Recall that in the latter case the\nequality (12) is valid, if Pj 6\u2208 V\u0304 + . Having written down W (\u03be1 , . . . , \u03ben\u22121 , X) as\nZ\n1\nW (\u03be1 ..., \u03ben\u22121 , X) =\ne\u2212i Pj \u03bej W (P1 ..., Pn\u22121 , X) d P1 ...d Pn\u22121 ,\n(2\u03c0)n\u22121\n(13)\nand taking into account that Wightman functions are tempered distributions\nwith respect to the commutative variables, we obtain that, due to the condition\n(12), W (\u03bd1 , . . . , \u03bdn\u22121 , X) is analytical in the \"tube\" Tn\u2212 :\n\u03bdi \u2208 Tn\u2212 ,\n\nif\n\n\u03bdi = \u03bei \u2212 i \u03b7i , \u03b7i \u2208 V2+ , \u03b7i = {\u03b7i0 , \u03b7i3 }.\n\n(14)\n\nIt should be stressed that the noncommutative coordinates x1i , x2i remain always\nreal.\nOwing to S O (1, 1) invariance and according to the Bargmann-Hall-Wightman\ntheorem [1] - [3], W (\u03bd1 , . . . , \u03bdn\u22121 , X) is analytical in the domain Tn\nTn = \u222a\u039bc \u039bc Tn\u2212 ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u039bc \u2208 S Oc (1, 1) is the two-dimensional analogue of the complex Lorentz\ngroup. This expansion is similar to the transition from tubes to expanded tubes\nin the commutative case. Just as in the commutative case, the expanded domain\nof analyticity contains real points xi , which are the noncommutative Jost points,\nsatisfying the condition xi \u223c xj , \u2200 i, j, which means that\nx0i \u2212 x0j\n\n\u00012\n\n\u2212 x3i \u2212 x3j\n\n\u00012\n\n< 0.\n\n(16)\n\nIt should be emphasized that the noncommutative Jost points are a subset of\nthe set of Jost points of the commutative case, when\n2\n\n(xi \u2212 xj ) < 0\n\n\u2200 i, j.\n\n(17)\n\nLet us point out that WLCC and LCC, respectively have the same form as in\nthe local theory:\nW (x1 , . . . , xn ) = W (xn , . . . , x1 ),\n\nif xi \u223c xj\n\n\u2200 i, j;\n\nW (x1 , . . . , xi , xi+1 , . . . , xn ) = W (x1 , . . . , xi+1 , xi , . . . , xn ),\n2\n\n(18)\n(19)\n\n2\n\nif supp fi \u2208 Oi \u00d7 R , supp fi+1 \u2208 Oi+1 \u00d7 R , Oi \u223c Oi+1 , which means that the\ncondition (16) is valid for any points xi \u2208 Oi \u00d7 R2 and xi+1 \u2208 Oi+1 \u00d7 R2 .\n\n3\n\nTheorems of Reeh and Schlieder in NC QFT\n\nIn the following we shall prove the analogues of the theorems of Reeh and\nSchlieder [1, 2] for the noncommutative case.\n\n6\n\n\fTheorem 1 Let supports of functions fi belong to O \u00d7 R2 , where O is\nany open domain on variables x0i and x3i .\nThen there is no vector distinct from zero, which is orthogonal to all vectors of\n\u22c6*** \u0303\n\u22c6 \u03c6fn \u03a80 , supp fi \u2208 O \u00d7 R2 .

According to the condition (21), this function\nis equal to zero on the border, if xi \u2208 O \u00d7 R2 . As O is an open domain,\nW \u0303\u22c6 (y1 , ...ym , x1 , ..., xn ) \u2261 0. Thus the vector \u03a8 is orthogonal to all vectors\nof the type (6) and, according to the cyclicity of the vacuum vector, \u03a8 = 0.\nTaking into account the completeness of the system of vectors \u03a8 we come to the\nstatement of the Theorem. Remark that for the proof of the Theorem 1 only\nthe analyticity of the Wightman functions in the domain Tn\u2212 has been used.\nTheorem 2 Let the support of f \u0303 \u2208 \u00d5 \u00d7 R2 , where \u00d5 is such a domain of\ncommutative variables, for which domain O \u223c \u00d5, satisfying the condition of the\nTheorem 1, exists. Then the condition\n\u03c6f \u0303 \u03a80 = 0\n\n(22)\n\n\u03c6f \u0303 \u2261 0,\n\n(23)\n\nimplies that\nif the operator \u03c6f \u0303 satisfies the LCC.\nIn accordance with LCC\n\u03c6f \u0303  \u0303\u22c6 \u03a6 = 0,\n\n(24)\n\nif vector \u03a6 is defined as in eq. (20). Hence, for any vector \u03a8 belonging to the\ndomain of definition of the Hermitian operator \u03c6f \u0303,\nh\u03c6f \u0303  \u0303\u22c6 \u03a8, \u03a6i = h \u03a8, \u03c6f \u0303  \u0303\u22c6 \u03a6i = 0.\n\n(25)\n\nAccording to the Theorem 1, the condition (25) means that \u03c6f \u0303  \u0303\u22c6 \u03a8 = 0. As the\ndomain of definition of the operator \u03c6f \u0303 is dense in J, this equality means the\nvalidity of the equality (23).\nRemark Theorem 2 remains true for any densely defined operator \u03c8f \u0303,\nmutually local with \u03c6f , i.e. if\n\u03c8f \u0303 \u0303\u22c6\u03c6f  \u0303\u22c6\u03a6 = \u03c6f  \u0303\u22c6\u03c8f \u0303 \u0303\u22c6\u03a6,\n\n(26)\n\nif supp f \u2208 O \u00d7 R2 , supp f \u0303 \u2208 \u00d5 \u00d7 R2 , O \u223c \u00d5, vector \u03a6 belongs to the domain\nof definition of operators \u03c6f and \u03c8f \u0303.\n7\n\n\f4\n\nIrreducibility of the set of field operators \u03c6f\nin NC QFT\n\nIn the noncommutative case, the irreducibility of a set of field operators \u03c6f\nimplies that, from the condition\n\u22c6 * * *  \u0303\u22c6 \u03c6fn \u03a80 = \u03c6f1  \u0303\u22c6 * * *  \u0303\u22c6 \u03c6fn A \u03a80\nA \u03c6f1  \u0303\n\n(27)\n\nwhere fi are arbitrary test functions and A is a bounded operator, follows that\nA = CII\n\nC \u2208C\nI\n\n(28)\n\nwhere II is the identity operator.\nIn the noncommutative case the condition of irreducibility of the set of operators \u03c6f is valid as well as in commutative case. The point is that for this it is\nsufficient to have the translational invariance in the variable x0 and the spectral\ncondition, which can be weakened up to the condition\nPn0 \u2265 0.\n\n(29)\n\nUsing condition (27) and the invariance of the vacuum vector with respect to\nthe translations U (a) on the axis x0 , we obtain the following equality\n\u22c6*** \u0303\n\u22c6 \u03c6fn \u03a80 i = h \u03c6fn  \u0303\u22c6 * * *  \u0303\u22c6 \u03c6f1 \u03a80 , U (\u2212a) A \u03a80 i.\nh A\u2217 \u03a80 , U (a) \u03c6f1  \u0303\n\n(30)\n\nIn accordance with the eq.

(32) in accordance with the boundedness of the operator A and ciclicity of the vacuum vector.\n\n8\n\n\f5\n\nGeneralized Haag's Theorem\n\nRecall the formulation of the generalized Haag's theorem in the commutative\ncase ([1], Theorem 4.17):\nLet \u03c61f (t) and \u03c62f (t), supp f \u2208 R3 be two irreducible sets of operators, for\nwhich the vacuum vectors \u03a810 and \u03a820 are cyclic. Further, let the corresponding\nWightman functions be analytical in the domain Tn 2 .\nThen the two-, three- and four-point Wightman functions coincide in the two\ntheories if there is a unitary operator V , such that\n1) \u03c62f (t) = V \u03c61f (t) V \u2217 ,\n2)\n\n\u03a820\n\n=CV\n\n\u03a810 ,\n\nC \u2208 C,\nI\n\n(33)\n|C| = 1.\n\n(34)\n\nIt should be emphasized that actually the condition 2) is a consequence of\ncondition 1) with rather general assumptions (see the Statement below). In the\nformulation of Haag's theorem it is assumed that the formal operators \u03c6i (t, ~x)\ncan be smeared only on the spatial variables. This assumption is natural also\nin noncommutative case if \u03b80i = 0.\nLet us consider Haag's theorem in the S O(1, 1) invariant field theory and\nshow that the corresponding equality is true only for two-point Wightman functions.\nFor the proof we first note that in the noncommutative case, just as in\nthe commutative one, from conditions 1) and 2) it follows that the Wightman\nfunctions in the two theories coincide at equal times\nh\u03a810 , \u03c61 (t, x~1 )  \u0303\n\u22c6 * * * \u03c61 (t, x~n ) \u03a810 i = h\u03a820 , \u03c62 (t, x~1 )  \u0303\u22c6 * * * \u03c62 (t, x~n ) \u03a820 i.\n\n(35)\n\nHaving written down the two-point Wightman functions Wi (x1 , x2 ), i = 1, 2\nas Wi (u1 , v1 ; u2 , v2 ), where ui = {x0i , x3i }, vi = {x1i , x2i } we can write for them\nequality (35) as:\nW1 (0, \u03be 3 ; v1 , v2 ) = W2 (0, \u03be 3 ; v1 , v2 ),\n(36)\nwhere \u03be = u1 \u2212 u2 , v1 and v2 are arbitrary vectors. Now we notice that, due to\nthe S O(1, 1) invariance,\n\nhence,\n\n \u0303 v1 , v2 )\nWi (0, \u03be 3 ; v1 , v2 ) = Wi (\u03be;\n\n(37)\n\n \u0303 v1 , v2 ) = W2 (\u03be;\n \u0303 v1 , v2 ),\nW1 (\u03be;\n\n(38)\n\nwhere \u03be\u0303 is any Jost point. Due to the analyticity of the Wightman functions in\nthe commuting variables they are completely determined by their values at the\nJost points. Thus at any \u03be from the equality (38), it follows that\nW1 (\u03be; v1 , v2 ) = W2 (\u03be; v1 , v2 ).\n\n(39)\n\n2 Remark that the required analyticity of the Wightman functions follows only from the\nspectral condition and the S O(1, 3) invariance of the theory.\n\n9\n\n\fAs v1 and v2 are arbitrary, the formula (39) means the equality of two-point\nWightman functions at all values of arguments.\nThus, for the equality of the two-point Wightman functions in two theories\nrelated by the conditions (33) and (34), the S O(1, 1) invariance of the theory\nand corresponding spectral condition are sufficient.\nIt is impossible to extend this proof to three-point Wightman functions. Indeed, let us write down Wi (x1 , x2 , x3 ) as Wi (u1 , u2 , u3 ; v1 , v2 , v3 ), where vectors\nui and vi are determined as before. Equality (36) means that\nW1 (0, \u03be13 , 0, \u03be23 ; v1 , v2 , v3 ) = W2 (0, \u03be13 , 0, \u03be23 ; v1 , v2 , v3 ),\n\n(40)\n\nv1 , v2 , v3 are arbitrary. In order to have equality of the three-point Wightman\nfunctions in the two theories from the S O(1, 1) invariance, the existence of\ntransformations \u039b \u2208 S O(1, 1) connecting the points (0, \u03be13 ) and (0, \u03be23 ) with an\nopen vicinity of Jost points is necessary. That would be possible, if there existed\ntwo-dimensional vectors \u03be\u03031 and \u03be \u03032 , (\u03be \u0303i = \u039b (0, \u03bei3 )), satisfying the inequalities:\nq\n2\n2\n2\n2\n(\u03be \u03031 ) < 0, (\u03be \u03032 ) < 0, |(\u03be \u03031 , \u03be \u03032 )| < (\u03be \u03031 ) (\u03be \u03032 ) .\n\nThese inequalities are similar to the corresponding inequalities in the commutative case (see equation (4.87) in [1]). However, it is easy to check that the last\nof these inequalities can not be fulfilled, while the first two are fulfilled.\nLet us show now that the condition (34) actually is a consequence of the\ncondition (33).\nStatement Condition (34) is fulfilled, if the vacuum vectors \u03a8i0 are unique,\nnormalized, translationally invariant vectors with respect to translations Ui (a)\nalong the axis x3 .\nIt is easy to see that the operator U1\u22121 (a) V \u22121 U2 (a) V commutes with operators \u03c61f (t) and, owing to the irreducibility of the set of these operators, it\nis proportional to the identity operator. Having considered the limit a = 0, we\nsee that\nU1\u22121 (a) V \u22121 U2 (a) V = I.I\n(41)\nFrom the equality (41) it follows directly that if\nU1 (a) \u03a810 = \u03a810 ,\n\n(42)\n\nU2 (a) V \u03a810 = V \u03a810 ,\n\n(43)\n\nthen\ni.e. the condition (34) is fulfilled. If the theory is translationally invariant in all\nvariables, the equality (43) is true, if the vacuum vector is unique, normalized,\ntranslationally invariant in the spatial coordinates.\nThe most important consequence of the generalized Haag theorem is the\nfollowing statement: if one of the two fields related by conditions (33) and (34)\nis a free field, the other is also free. In deriving this result the equality of the\ntwo-point Wightman functions in the two theories and LCC are used. In [21] it\nis proved that this result is valid also in the noncommutative theory, if \u03b80i = 0.\n10\n\n\fHere we obtain the close result in the S O(1, 1) symmetric theory using\nthe spectral conditions and translational invariance only with respect to the\ncommutating coordinates. In this case the equality of the two-point Wightman\nfunctions in the two theories leads to the conclusion that if LCC (19) is fulfilled\nand the current in one of the theories is equal to zero, for example, jf1 = 0, then\njf2 = 0 as well; jfi = (\u0003 + m2 ) \u03c6if . Indeed as W1 (x1 , x2 ) = W2 (x1 , x2 ),\n< \u03a810 , j 1 (x1 )j 1 (x2 ) \u03a810 >=< \u03a820 , j 2 (x1 )j 2 (x2 ) \u03a820 >= 0,\n\n(44)\n\nsince jf1 = 0. Hence,\njf2 \u03a820 = 0.\nHere we assume that J is a positive metric space. It is sufficient to take advantage of the Theorem 2 from which follows that jf2 = 0 (see the Remark after\nTheorem 2), since LC implies mutual local commutativity of a field operator\nand the corresponding current.\nLet us proceed now to the S O(1, 3) symmetric theory. In this case we\nshow that from the equality of the four-point Wightman functions for the fields\n\u03c61f (t) and \u03c62f (t), related by the conditions (33) and (34), which takes place\nin the commutative theory, an essential physical consequence follows. Namely,\nfor such fields the elastic scattering amplitudes of the corresponding theories\ncoincide, hence, due to the optical theorem, the total cross-sections coincide\nas well. In particular, if one of these fields, for example, \u03c61f is a trivial field,\ni.e. the corresponding S matrix is equal to unity, also the field \u03c62f is free. In\nthe derivation of this result the local commutativity condition is not used. The\nstatement follows directly from the Lehmann-Symanzik-Zimmermann reduction\nformulas [30]. Here and below dealing with the commutative case in order not\nto complicate formulas we consider operators \u03c61 (x) and \u03c62 (x) as they are given\nin a point.\nLet < p3 , p4 |p1 , p2 >i , i = 1, 2 be an elastic scattering amplitudes for the\nfields \u03c61 (x) and \u03c62 (x) respectively. Owing to the reduction formulas,\nZ\n< p3 , p4 |p1 , p2 >i \u223c\nd x1 * * * d x4 ei (\u2212p1 x1 \u2212p2 x2 +p3 x3 +p4 x4 ) *\n4\nY\n\n(\u0003j + m2 ) < 0|T \u03c6i (x1 ) * * * \u03c6i (x4 )|0 >,\n\n(45)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere T \u03c6i (x1 ) * * * \u03c6i (x4 ) is the chronological product of operators. From the\nequality\nW2 (x1 , . . . , x4 ) = W1 (x1 , . . . , x4 )\nit follows that\n< p3 , p4 |p1 , p2 >2 =< p3 , p4 |p1 , p2 >1\n\n(46)\n\nfor any pi . Having applied this equality for the forward elastic scattering amplitudes, we obtain that, according to the optical theorem, the total cross-sections\nfor the fields \u03c61 (x) and \u03c62 (x) coincide. If now the S-matrix for the field \u03c61 (x)\n11\n\n\fis unity, then it is also unity for field \u03c62 (x). We stress that the equality of\nthe four-point Wightman functions in the two theories related by the conditions\n(33) and (34) are valid only in the commutative field theory but not in the\nnoncommutative case.\n\n6\n\nEquivalence of various conditions of local commutativity in QFT\n\nLet us show that in the commutative case, when Wightman functions are analytical ones in the usual domain, the conditions (18) and (19) are equivalent\nto the standard conditions of WLC and LC, i.e. the latter remain valid if the\ncondition (17) is fulfilled. In effect, (18) is a sufficient condition for the theory to\nbe CPT invariant [18]. However, in the commutative case, from CPT invariance\nthe standard condition of WLC follows. [1] - [3].\nThe equivalence of LCC (19) with the standard one follows from the fact\nthat, for the validity of usual LCC its validity on arbitrary small spatially divided\ndomains is sufficient (see [4], Proposal 9.12). Indeed, validity of \"noncommutative\" LCC (19) in commutative the case means validity of standard LCC in the\n2\n2\ndomain (x0 \u2212 y 0 ) \u2212 (x3 \u2212 y 3 ) < 0, xk , y k , k = 1, 2 are arbitrary. This domain\nsatisfies the requirements of the above mentioned statement.\nBesides we can replace (19) with the formally weaker condition, requiring\nthat it is valid only when\nx0i \u2212 x0j\n\n\u00012\n\n\u2212 x3i \u2212 x3j\n\n\u00012\n\n< \u2212l2 , \u2200 i, j,\n\n(47)\n\nwhere l is any fixed fundamental length. Indeed, in the commutative theory, according to the results of Wightman, Petrina and Vladimirov (see [31], Chapter 5\nand references therein) the condition\n[\u03c6 (x), \u03c6 (y)] = 0,\n\n(x \u2212 y)2 < \u2212l2 ,\n\n(48)\n\nfor any finite l, is equivalent to standard LCC (l = 0). Similarly if (19) is fulfilled\nat (47), then it is fulfilled also at l = 0.\nThus, the analysis of Wightman functions in NC QFT, carried out in this\nand our previous works [19], [20], [21], shows that the basic axiomatic results are\nvalid (or have analogues) in NC QFT as well, at least in the case when \u03b80i = 0.\n\nReferences\n[1] R.
