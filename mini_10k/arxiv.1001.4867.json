Introduction\nAs nanofabrication techniques become increasingly fast and accurate, the performance of plasmonic\nsystems relies less and less on structure fabrication and more on the fundamental limitations of the\n\n\funderlying materials. Plasmonics has seen an exponential growth, due mainly to the sheer diversity of\napplications, from optical cloaking [1] to superlensing [melville2005, pendry2000] as well as single\nmolecule surface enhanced raman spectroscopy [2], parasite therapy [3] and optical circuits[4] with\nhigh speed optical switching[5, 6].\nA number of studies have been performed comparing the plasmonic merit of different metals (see e.g.\n[7]), and although the alkali metals have increased performance over the noble metals at many\nfrequencies and permittivities, experimental convenience or necessity of inertness dictates that the\nnoble metals are used more frequently.\nThe free electron character of the alkali and noble metals plays a pivotal role in their plasmonic\nperformance. As the number of free electron metals in the periodic table is severely limited, use of\ndoped metals, alloys and intermetallics to tune the frequency and permittivity response of materials,\nwhile simultaneously reducing chemical reactivity and loss, seems an obvious choice.\nThe concept of loss mitigation by the introduction of gain materials into plasmonic devices is an\nalternative, though technically more challenging approach. The idea was introduced by Ramakrishna\nand Pendry [8] who investigated the affect of a gain material replacing the dielectric layers in a\nmultilayer superlensing stack. The imaginary component of the frequency dependent dielectric function\n\u03b5 (\u03c9 ) = \u03b5 \u2032 + i\u03b5 \u2032\u2032 , which describes the phase lag of the electrons behind the applied electric field, is\nnegated by a material with a negative effective phase contribution \u03b5 gain (\u03c9 ) = \u03b5 \u2032 \u2212 i\u03b5 \u2032\u2032 .\n\nThe fluorescent dye Rhodamine 6G has been used to compensate for loss in both Local Surface\nPlasmon (LSP)[9] and propagating Surface Plasmon Polariton (SPP) [9] based systems. Increased\nconfinement of light in metallic waveguides causes a substantial increase in the optical loss. The\nintroduction of gain materials into these systems was proposed by Maier [10]. Quantum dots have been\nproposed [11] and demonstrated [12] to reduce this loss.\nIn addition to increased optical loss due to confinement, a number of damping mechanisms contribute\nto the plasmonic performance of real systems. The effect of grain boundaries in gold films has been\ndiscussed quantitatively by Kuttge et al where they showed that the characteristic decay length of a\npropagating SPP mode would be reduced by a grain size dependent factor [13]. Similar effects are\napparent in systems with features smaller than the average electron mean free path, and such surface\nscattering has a significant impact on the optical response of small particles[14] and thin shells (see eg\n[15]). In addition to surface scattering, the introduction of surfaces allows for the decay of plasmons\ninto electron-hole pairs via surface states (see for example [16] [17]).\nIt is possible to optimize [18] the size, shape and composition of a multilayer metal system to get the\noptimum resonance at a particular wavelength, for example to match the absorption profile of a\nfluorescent dye. Although such systems present yet another way to optimize a plasmonic system, here\nwe shall focus on homogenous systems.\nIn addition to the conventional methods for tuning the optical response of plasmonic systems, namely\nmodification of structure size and shape; varying the composition of alloyed and intermetallic\nnanostructures can be used to tune the response. Many studies have investigated the optical properties\nof noble metal alloy nanoparticles, most notably the Ag-Au alloys, where the plasmon absorption\nmaximum varies linearly from the elemental Ag value of 380nm to the elemental Au value of 520nm as\nthe stoichiometry is varied [19, 20]. This leads one to erroneously assume that the response can be\nmodeled using a simple, linear combination of the experimental dielectric functions. However, this is\n\n\fnot the case and a more rigorous description in terms of the movement of the optical gap and Fermi\nenergy is required. Other alloys are also in use in plasmonics, for example Chiu et al [21]describe a\nsynthesis technique for producing NiAu alloy nanoparticles in various stoichiometries with the\nadditional property of magnetism. The absorption efficiency of the particles, and hence the plasmon\nefficacy, reduces with increasing Ni. Other alloys such as the Cu/Zn system show more complex\nbehaviour, with 95% Cu, 5% Zn particles having a higher absorption efficiency than the 100%, 70%\nand 30% Cu particles[22]. Fabrication of Sn-based intermetallic nanoparticles has resulted[23] in a\nmultitude of shapes including some similar to the familiar split ring resonator often used in metamaterials[24]. Ferrando et al have recently published a comprehensive review of nano-alloys and their\noptical and catalytic properties [25].\nAl/Ga and Au/Ga nanocomposites have been used in high speed plasmon polariton modulation\n[krasavin2006, macdonald2007], and we shall discuss some of the interesting properties of liquid\nmetals in section 7.1.\nAlthough we shall focus mainly on bulk materials, there are particular alloy combinations which do not\nhave stable bulk phases but do however alloy when structured on the nanoscale (see for example FeAg\n[26]).\nTo date, reasonably few intermetallic compounds have been used in plasmonics with the main\ncandidates being AuAl2 [27] and MgB2 [kussow2007, limberopoulos2009], with other examples\nincluding the Heussler type compound Co2FeGa [28] and Au3Zn [29]. Nanoparticles made of the latter\nshow slightly increased absorption efficiency over comparable gold particles.\nThe transition metal silicides are particularly interesting in light of the ease at which waveguides can be\nconstructed in silicon using conventional semiconductor manufacturing techniques. The transition\nmetals can be masked onto the surface and diffused into silicon, creating guiding structures. In section 5\nwe discuss their optical properties.\nWest et al have recently discussed the merits of a number of alternative plasmonic systems [30] which\nwe shall not discuss here - namely graphene, semiconductors and phonon polariton materials such as\nSiC. Here, we present a complimentary review focusing on the electronic properties of some materials\nnot discussed in detail by West et al. We largely discount the technical challenges that the utilisation of\nthese materials may impose on device fabrication.\nThis paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 we shall discuss the necessary electronic features of a\ngood plasmonic material and the properties of some metals. In Sections 3-7 we will discuss the optical\nproperties of other plasmonic materials, which encompass five classes of materials as follows. (3)\nAlloys - includes mainly non-stoichiometric materials, doped materials and nanograined materials. (4)\nIntermetallic compounds. (5) Silicides. (6) Systems under pressure. (7) Metallic glasses, liquids and\namorphous alloys.\n\n2. Plasmonic materials: Definitions and review of metals\n2.1 Quality factors and the ideal plasmonic material\nThe complex dielectric function \u03b5 (\u03c9 ) = \u03b5 \u2032 + i\u03b5 \u2032\u2032 fully describes the macroscopic electronic response of a\nmaterial. It is possible to excite a surface plasmon resonance at any frequency for which the real part of\nthe permittivity is less than zero. The quality of the associated resonance depends on the value of the\n\n\fimaginary permittivity at this frequency. For the ideal free electron gas, the dielectric function is usually\nwritten in the form of a Drude model:\n\n\u03c9 2p\n\u03b5 D (\u03c9 ) = 1 \u2212\n\u03c9 (\u03c9 + i / \u03c4 )\n\n(1)\n\nThe plasma frequency, \u03c9 p is a function of the electron mass and density, and the phenomenological\nscattering time \u03c4 is sometimes replaced with a scattering frequency \u03b3 that encompasses all scattering\nmechanisms including electron-electron, electron-phonon, surface and defect interactions. The bare\nplasma frequency can be determined by calculating the transition rate at the Fermi surface in the limit\nof zero energy and momentum transfer [31].\n\n\u03c9 2p =\n\n8\u03c0\n3V\n\n\u2211 Pi,i,k\n\n2\n\n\u03b4 ( Ei,k \u2212 E F ) ,\n\n(2)\n\ni ,k\n\nwhere P is the momentum matrix element with wavevector k within band i. This can also be written:\n2\n\ndEi ,k\n8\u03c0\n\u03b4 ( Ei ,k \u2212 E F )\n(3)\n\u2211\n3V i ,k dk\nwhere Ei,k is just the energy of the ith band at wavevector k. Thus the bare plasma frequency is just a\nsum of the gradient of bands at the Fermi surface. In section 6 we will comment on the effect of\npressure on the gradient of the bands at the Fermi energy, and in section 3 we shall discuss doping as a\nmethod of modifying the Fermi energy.\n\n\u03c9 2p =\n\nIn real materials, the plasma frequency is shifted from the bare plasma frequency (Eqn 2,3) due to\nscreening by interband transitions, which are single particle excitations from the valence to conduction\nbands. For example, the screened plasma frequency \u03c9 s in silver is at 3.8 eV compared to the bare\nplasma frequency value of 9.6 eV.\nWe have reviewed and developed a series of metrics to determine the proficiency of metals to perform\nin particular plasmonics applications[7]. Although every specific geometry will have a different quality\nfactor, in the limit of low loss and the applicability of electrostatics, two generic limiting cases can be\nderived, (i) for localized surface plasmon (LSP) applications which include the absorption efficiency of\nnanospheres and nanoshells, and the resolving power of a multilayer and the 'poor mans' superlens and\n(ii) for extended modes such as surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) and extended LSP modes of\nellipsoids.\nQLSP = \u2212\u03b5 \u2032 / \u03b5 \u2032\u2032 ,\n\nQSPP = \u03b5 \u2032 2 / \u03b5 \u2032\u2032 .\n\n(4a,b)\n\nIn the quasistatic regime, where the features of the plasmonic system are much smaller than the\nwavelength of light, localized surface plasmons depend on the dielectric function linearly, whereas\nSPPs depend on the square of the real part. In the limit of low loss, the quality factors can be written in\nterms of the complex refractive index m = n + ik :\nQLSP = k / 2n ,\nQSPP = k 3 / 2n ,\nor the frequency dependent complex optical conductivity \u03c3 (\u03c9 ) = \u03c3 1 (\u03c9 ) + i\u03c3 2 (\u03c9 ) :\n\n(5a,b)\n\n\fQLSP =\n\n\u03c3 2 \u2212 \u03c9 / 4\u03c0\n,\n\u03c31\n\nQSPP =\n\n(\u03c9 \u2212 4\u03c0\u03c3 2 ) 2\n.\n4\u03c0\u03c3 1\u03c9\n\n(6a,b)\n\nBy substituting the Drude model (1) into the quality factors (4) and solving for maximum quality we\narrive at: [32]\nmax\n=\nQLSP\n\n2(\u03c9 2p \u2212 \u03b3 2 )3 / 2\n3\u03b3\u03c9 2p 3\n\n,\n\nmax\nQSPP\n=\n\n\u03c9 2p\n2\u03b3 2\n\n.\n\n(7)\n\nIt is now apparent that the most important factor is a large bare plasma frequency to damping ratio\n\n\u03c9 p / \u03b3 . In the event that the scattering rate is unknown, it is often sufficient to make the approximation:\n\u03b3 (T ) = \u03b5 0\u03c9 2p \u03c1 DC (T ) ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03c1 DC (T ) is the temperature dependent DC resistivity and \u03b5 0 is the permittivity of free space.\n\n2.2 A review of the optical properties of metals\nIn contrast to gold, the band edge (that is, the frequency at which interband transitions become allowed)\nin silver is at a frequency above the screened plasma frequency, so that surface modes cannot decay into\nelectron hole-pairs. In gold, the situation is more problematic, since for permittivities \u2212 \u03b5 \u2032 < 2 the\nsurface plasmons decay into electron hole pairs, resulting in a much reduced quality factor at these\nfrequencies.\nUnfortunately, the effect of interband transitions is much less localized in frequency than this simple\npicture portrays. Consider a simple Gaussian distribution representing transitions from some valence to\nconduction band. The transitions are centered at some frequency \u03bc with distribution \u03c3 which\napproximately describes the dispersion of the bands in the metal, and a number \u03b1 which describes the\nnumber of electrons involved in the transitions (and simultaneously the variation in angular momentum\ncharacter across the Brillouin zone). The interband spectrum now looks like:\n\uf8eb (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03bc ) 2 \uf8f6\n\uf8f7\nexp\uf8ec \u2212\n\uf8ec\n2\u03c3 2 \uf8f7\uf8f8\n2\u03c0\u03c3 2\n\uf8ed\nWe now use a Kramers-Kronig integration to determine the real part of the spectrum,\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b5 ib\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9 ) =\n\n\u03b5 ib\u2032 (\u03c9 ) = 1 +\n\n2\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2032\u2032 (\u03a9)\n\u03a9\u03b5 ib\n\nd\u03a9\n\u03a92 \u2212 \u03c9 2\nwhere P indicates the principal part of the integral, and we set \u03c9 = 0 :\n\n\u03b5 ib\u2032 (0) = 1 +\n\n\u03c0\n\nP\u222b\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\n0\n\n\u2032\u2032 (\u03a9)\n2 \u221e \u03b5 ib\nd\u03a9\n\u222b\n\u03c0 0 \u03a9\n\n(11)\n\n\u2032 (0) \u2248 1 + 2\u03b1 / \u03c0\u03bc if \u03bc >> \u03c3 . This of course has the effect that even\nwhich can be approximated by \u03b5 ib\nat frequencies well below the band edge, the real part of the permittivity has additional positive\ncomponent which degrades the local surface plasmon quality factor:\nmax\nQLSP\n\n=\n\n2(\u03c9 2p \u2212 2\u03b3 2 [1 + \u03b1 / \u03c0\u03bc ])3 / 2\n3\u03b3\u03c9 2p 6(1 + \u03b1 / \u03c0\u03bc )\n\n(12)\n\n\fThis is our second criteria for a high quality plasmonic material: the number of electrons involved in\ninterband transitions must be low, and at the highest possible frequency. This simple and quite obvious\ncriteria significantly reduces the number of materials that are likely to have favorable optical properties,\nby the simple fact that all materials with partially occupied d or f states are going to perform poorly\nacross the visible due to interband transitions, and even if the transitions do not extend into the IR,\npoorly at low frequencies because of the aforementioned residual low frequency effect on the\npolarizability.\n\u2032 ( 0) ,\nThe effect of interband transitions on the maximum value of QSPP is slightly obscure. For low \u03b5 ib\n\u2032 (0) increases, maximum QSPP shifts to lower\nthe frequency for maximum QSPP is just \u03b3 . As \u03b5 ib\nfrequencies. It is apparent from the damping frequencies listed in table 1 that it is not particularly useful\nto describe the maximum in QSPP . In fact, when the plasma frequency to damping ratio is large,\ninterband transitions have almost no effect on the magnitude of QSPP .\nIn figure 1, we present the maximum values for QLSP (bold) and the frequencies at which they occur\nfor all non-group-f metals. Due to a combination of high plasma frequency to damping ratios, low\n\u2032 (0) , free electron like metals dominate the periodic\nprobability interband transitions and hence low \u03b5 ib\ntable in terms of plasmonic performance. For gold and silver, their quality as plasmonic materials is\nevident from the sheer number of publications in this area. Reported experimental maximum QLSP\nvalues for silver range from tens [33] to hundreds [34] with the latter matching experimental plasmonic\ndevice data more closely [35]. Experimental optical constants for gold show similar variability, with\nQLSP values varying between 14 and 34. A number of studies have used the experimental permittivity\nto compare the plasmonic performance of alkali metals in a number of geometries [7, 36-38]. The\nGroup 13 metals, Ga and In have recently been studied by McMahon et al [39] where they report QLSP\nvalues of almost 100 for indium at 3.5 eV using the optical constants of [40], Ga performs better than\nSn, Pb, Bi, and Tl over the range 3.5 eV to 12 eV, but still has QLSP below 10 in this region [39].\nThe actinides[41] thorium, protactinium[42] and uranium[43] all have interband transitions from f to d\nstates [41], as do Gd and Dy [44]. These metals perform poorly over most frequencies. For a review of\nthe optical properties of the Lanthanides, see [45].\n\nFigure 1. Periodic table of the elements coloured by maximum QLSP .

While the plasma frequency and relaxation time\nof the Drude model are helpful in this regard, it is also important to consider the shift of permittivity as\nindicated by the interband component at zero frequency. Considering the best elemental metals, alkalis\nare free-electron-like but impractical, Au and Ag have significant interband transitions, and Al operates\nbest at very high frequency. These options are restrictive and hence we now consider alternatives to\nallow more choice of operating frequencies and potentially lower losses.\n\n3 Alloys\nNanograined materials can be effectively modeled using a linear combination of the dielectric functions\nof the constituent metals, weighted by their respective stoichiometries, with an additional damping term\nto simulate scattering by grain boundaries [46, 47] [48].\n\n3.1 Noble Metal Alloys\nDue to their interesting electronic structure and colour, the optical properties of noble-noble alloys are\namong the most studied of metallic compounds. Randomly oriented AuCu, AuAg and AgCu alloys\nwere studied by Rivory [49] both experimentally by evaporation onto glass substrates and using the\ncoherent-potential approximation (CPA) (see [50]). The interband transitions in Au-Ag alloys with\nsilver concentrations of (in atomic %): 0, 21, 41, 62, 94 and 100 were measured using\ntransmittance/reflectance and Kramers-Kronig analysis. The spectra of Au-Cu alloys were made with\nCu concentrations of 0, 12, 25, 40, 70, 81 and 100 at. %. Ag-Cu alloys were made with Cu\nconcentrations of 0, 6, 8, 30, 43, 55, 94 and 100 at.% but had to be deposited at 150K to prevent\nordering. The crystal size for Au-Ag and Au-Cu are in the range of 300nm to 500nm, whereas for AgCu they are roughly 1.5nm. It is evident from the interband transitions in the Ag-Cu spectra that 1.5 nm\ngrains are large enough to exhibit the effects of short range order, which causes bulk like interband\ntransitions to become evident. A reduction in short range order often indicates a reduction in the\nstrength of interband transitions. This effect is particularly noticeable when studying liquid metals (See\nfor example [51-53] and section 7). Highly ordered Ag-Cu alloys exhibit a similar 2.5 eV \u03b5 \u2032\u2032 peak\nmagnitude and shift [54]. The interband transition spectra of the three random alloys exhibits a simple\n'mixing' where all of the alloy transitions can be attributed to those of elemental gold, silver or copper\n[49]. Rivory et al report the onset of interband transitions in Au-Ag shifts continuously from 2.5 eV in\npure gold to 3.9 eV for pure silver, the extremes being in excellent agreement with the data of Kreibig\n[55]. A comparison with the optical data of Johnson and Christy[34] and Weaver et al[56] show\nexcellent agreement with the elemental data of Rivory et al. For Au-Cu the onset of interband\ntransitions shifts from 2.5 eV for pure gold down to an apparent minima at 2.2 eV for 50 at.% Au where\nit stays for Au concentrations down to pure copper. Part of this shift is due to a decrease in the lattice\n\n\fconstant [57]. In all three alloys, the metal with larger interband transitions dominates the spectra. The\norder of transition strength for these three metals is Cu > Au > Ag.\nDoping of Cu with Al has been shown to introduce indirect transitions near the L point, and the\nsecondary band edge shifts to lower energies, while the primary band edge generally gets larger with\nincreasing dopant concentration [58]. This effect also occurs for Cu doped with Ga, Zn, Sn, Si and Ge\n[59].\nThe random binary alloy Cu-Fe was made by Korn et al in various iron concentrations from 0 at.% to\n20 at.% [60]. The elemental copper peak at approximately 5 eV does not shift a great deal, indicating\nthat the Fermi level does not shift very much upon alloying, but the transition strength decreases,\nindicating a reduction in order. This effect occurs in Cu-Mn and to an extent in Cu-Pd and Ag-Pd as\nwell [61]. However, in none of these alloys is the minimum in \u03b5 \u2032\u2032 less than that of the constituent\nelements.\nAlloying of Ag with Mg and Cd causes an additional peak to appear below the 3.9 eV band edge of\nelemental silver [62, 63], which itself is reduced and allows for the excitation of bulk plasmons above 5\neV, albeit with reduced efficacy due to the overlap with interband transitions, similar to gold. The\naddition of Sn causes a dramatic increase in the scattering rate up to 0.6 eV (similar to bulk aluminum),\nand no additional interband transitions are visible, the band edge seems to maintain the same magnitude\nand energy as that of elemental silver. The relaxation time increases marginally for the Mg and Cd\nalloys, with maximum values of approximately 0.2 eV and 0.15 eV respectively. They report\n\u03b3 = 0.04 eV for elemental silver.\nSilver-indium alloys show the interesting property that the transitions that make up the 3.9 eV peak can\nbe shifted upon alloying with indium [64]. The 3.87 eV L3 \u2192 L2 transition shifts to higher energies and\nthe 4.03 eV L2 \u2192 L1 shifts to lower energies. The magnitude of the 3.9 eV peak decreases with\nincreasing In concentration, but the plasma frequency decreases and the damping frequency increases.\nThe overall effect of alloying on \u03b5 \u2032\u2032 is to increase the imaginary permittivity, resulting in a minimum of\n1.5 at 3.5 eV for 12 at.% indium compared to the minimum value for silver, where \u03b5 \u2032\u2032 = 0.37 . The\nintroduction of Ni defects in gold has a similar effect, increasing the damping frequency due to impurity\nscattering, but reduces the magnitude of the band edge [65].\n\n3.2 Transition Metal alloys\nThomas and Thurm performed optical experiments on binary alloys of W, Ta, Re and Ir in various\nstoichiometries [66]. Although the optical properties of the alloys are not linearly dependent on the\noptical properties of the elements, the magnitude of the interband transition maximum in \u03b5 \u2032\u2032 always lies\nin between the maximum values for the elements. The maximum in the interband spectrum shifts as\nfollows through the alloy series: W: 20 at 1.8 eV, Re: 16 at 2.5 eV, Ta: 14 at 3 eV.\nThe prospects for alloys in general can be summarized by observing that although they allow tuning of\nthe real part of the permittivity, they typically have interband strengths similar to their constituents.\nGrain size effects in some alloys (e.g. AgCu) may modulate interband transitions at the expense of\ndegraded relaxation time due to scattering in a similar fashion to amorphous materials.\n\n4. Intermetallics\nIn this section we shall discuss the optical properties of the intermetallic compounds in order of the\nnumber of constituent elements. As compounds they allow tuning, but avoid grain issues and can have\n\n\ftotally different properties compared to the reactants. We survey alkali-metal, noble-noble, group 13\nbinaries, other binaries and some ternary compounds.\n4.1 Alkali Metal Binary Intermetallics\nOptical measurements of LiAl in the NaTl structure suggest that this compound is an excellent free\nelectron metal with only a small interband transition around 0.55 eV, [67] whereas resistivity\nmeasurements present conflicting data, with values around 10 \u03bc\u03a9cm [68, 69] compared to silver and\ngold with values of 1.77 \u03bc\u03a9cm and 2.66 \u03bc\u03a9cm respectively [70].\nWe showed recently [71] that some of the alkali noble intermetallics had optical gap to plasma\nfrequency ratios greater than 1, indicating that it was very unlikely that interband transitions would\ndisrupt the optical response of these materials. Unfortunately, calculations of the DC resistivity\nindicated that the Drude phenomenological scattering rate was too high for these compounds to\ncompete with silver and gold [32]. A comparison of the local surface plasmon quality factors for these\nmaterials, alongside experimental data for silver and gold is presented in figure 2.\n\nFigure 2. Comparison of calculated local surface plasmon quality factors for the alkali-noble binary intermetallics\nwith the most favourable experimental values for silver [72] and gold [73].\n\n4.2 Noble Binary Intermetallics\nRivory et al also investigated the effect of short range ordering on the stoichiometric alloy AuCu3. With\nincreasing order a new peak appears at approximately 3.6 eV. Slightly different results were reported by\nScott et al; electropolishing of samples post annealing was shown to cause the peak to appear at 3.28\neV [74] but Skriver and Lengkeek noted that electropolishing preferentially etched grains in their\npolycrystalline sample and reported the peak at 3.6 eV [75]. They also remove the intraband\ncontribution from their experimental data using a Drude fit and note two additional peaks: one at 0.8 eV\nand another at 1.2 eV. CoPt3 and MnPt3 crystallise in the same structure as AuCu3 but partially\noccupied d-states result in many low energy transition mechanisms, resulting in QLSP < 1 between 1.5\neV and 5.0 eV [76].\nThe noble - group III alloys crystallize in the CaF2 structure. The noble atoms occupy sites on an FCC\ncell and the group III atoms form a simple cubic structure in the centre of the FCC cell [77]. The\n\n\fdiscovery of the purple coloured, gold aluminium alloy AuAl2 is often attributed to Sir Roberts-Austen\n[78]. It has since received a great deal of attention, not only due to its colour and applications in\njewellery, but also for its possible applications as an energy efficient window coating. Cortie et al [27]\nmeasure and calculate the reflectance spectra of AuAl2 using density functional theory. They show an\nexperimentally determined reflectance minima at 2.5 eV, which has been shown to persist for Al:Au\nratios of between 3.2:1 to 1:1 [79]. Minor discrepancies appear between the position of the measured\nand calculated reflectance minima due to self interaction errors. They also measure the reflectance of\nPtAl2 films which show a reflectance maximum at around 1.9 eV of 55% which steadily decreases into\nthe infrared.\nVishnubhatla et al [80] studied the optical properties of AuAl2 , AuGa2 and AuIn2 . They note that\ninterband transitions appear at 2.2 eV in AuAl2 and are responsible for the reflectance minimum at 2.5\neV. Hsu et al note that this transition is not due to Au 5d bands [77]. The onset of interband transitions\ndecreases as the atomic number of the alloying compound increases. AuGa2 has much broader\nexperimental interband transitions in the region around 2 eV than AuAl2 [80, 81]. Calculations show\nthat this broadening is caused by an additional transition at approximately 1.6 eV. When substituting\nplatinum for gold the reflectance minima at 2 eV shifts to 3eV and the reflectance peak at 3 eV shifts to\n4 eV. This occurs due to a combination of shift in the 2 eV transition peak to 3.6eV in PtGa2, and an\nassociated shift in the real part of the permittivity. The variation in the position of the transition peak\nbetween gold and platinum can be explained by a decrease in energy of the 5d bands of Au in AuGa2\ncausing the \u03937 band to be below the Fermi energy [81]. This effect is not seen in AuAl2 or AuIn2\n[hsu1994, switendick1969].\nSilver indium alloys show the interesting property that the transitions that make up the 3.9 eV peak in\nsilver can be shifted upon alloying with indium [64]. The result is that the 3.87 eV L3 \u2192 L\u20322 transition\nshifts to higher energies and the 4.03 eV L\u20322 \u2192 L1 shifts to lower energies. Unfortunately, the overall\neffect is to increase the imaginary permittivity, resulting in a reported minimum of 1.5 at 3.5 eV for 12\nat.% indium. The minimum \u03b5 \u2032\u2032 for silver occurs at approximately 3.5 eV with a value of 0.22. The\naddition of aluminium into silver also causes a continuous shift in the minimum of \u03b5 \u2032\u2032 from 0.22 to a\nvalue of 1.78 at 2.7 eV [82]. This increase in the minimum of \u03b5 \u2032\u2032 causes a decrease in the magnitude of\nthe real part of the permittivity, causing the main silver transition at 4 eV to shift to higher energies and\nits value to shift from 1.75 to just above zero, causing the permittivity of the alloy to become negative\nfor all energies below 7.6 eV [82].\nPlasma frequencies for the three CsCl structured Noble alloys AuZn, CuZn and PdIn are shifted quite\nsubstantially from their unscreened locations at 11.5 eV, 12.6 eV and 11.0 eV respectively by interband\ntransitions [83]. The biggest shift occurs for PdIn, where the screened plasma frequency is shifted to 2.4\neV. In AuZn the screened plasma frequency \u03c9 s is shifted the least with \u03b5 \u2032 crossing 0 at 7 eV. The real\npermittivity for CuZn exhibits a positive region between 2.5 eV and 3.1 eV, giving it a purplish pink\ncolour similar to that of AuZn which is yellow-pink. The interband transition strength is greatest in\nCuZn and least in PdIn. The onset of transitions appears to occur at approximately 1eV for PdIn and\nAuZn, and at about 2 eV for CuZn. All three compounds exhibit a transition gap between 2eV and 3eV\nin the region where \u03b5 \u2032 becomes steep due to intraband contributions. As the amount of disorder in\nCuZn is increased the band edge at 2eV reduces and a low energy transition become apparent [84].\nOf all the alloys studied here, CsCl structured binary intermetallics show the most promise, with large\noptical gaps and in some cases, plasma frequencies comparable to silver and gold.\n\n\f4.3 Group 13 Binary Intermetallics\nNiAl, CoAl and FeAl all have major interband contributions to the imaginary part of the permittivity,\nwith the minimum value of \u03b5 \u2032\u2032 being 10 for CoAl and FeAl at 2.75 eV and 3.25 eV respectively [85].\nOf Ni3Al [86], Ni3Ga and Ni3In, only Ni3In shows reasonable QLSP , with values above 2 at frequencies\nbelow 1 eV [87]. DFT calculations on Ni3Al and CoAl both suffer from the effect of partially occupied\nd-states, and exhibit the property that electron self energy corrections shift the interband transitions to\nlower energies, and hence Rhee et al use a negative lambda fitting regime, which corrects their optical\nspectra into line with experiment.\nThe optical properties of CoAl and NiAl alloys were determined by Kim et al [88] both experimentally\nand using the linearized augmented plane wave (LAPW) method. Their calculations show very good\nagreement with experiment below 2.5eV, and accurately describe the onset of interband transitions\nwhich occurs at 1eV for CoAl and 2.5 eV for NiAl. The variation in the onset of interband transitions is\nattributed to a shift in the Fermi energy with the addition of a d-electron in nickel. In CoAl, transitions\nacross a band pair along \u0393-M -X and X-R are responsible for the low energy transitions. When nickel is\nsubstituted for cobalt, the top band becomes occupied and transitions become impossible. The\nminimum \u03b5 \u2032\u2032 they report for NiAl is approximately 11 at the low energy edge of their experimental\ndata (1.2 eV) and approximately 4.5 at the high energy edge of their experimental data (6.0 eV) for\nCoAl. The FP-LAPW method using GGA (PW92 functional) and self energy corrected LDA (LDA +\nU) exchange correlation functionals were used by Rhee et al [89] to calculate the optical properties of\nFeAl. It was found that both LDA+U and a positive \u03bb fitting routine were required to improve the\nagreement with experiment as the effects of correlation are known to induce a paramagnetic ground\nstate in FeAl. The experimental spectra exhibits three main transitions at 0.5 eV with magnitude 102,\none at 1.5 eV with magnitude 29 and the last at 4 eV with magnitude 12. Transitions below 3 eV occur\naround the \u0393, X and M special points [90]. The minimum in \u03b5 \u2032\u2032 occurs at the high energy edge of the\nexperimental data at 5 eV with a value of 9.6. The calculations indicate that the transitions decrease\nover this region. Other groups [91] report maximum transition magnitudes of 55, almost half that of\nRhee et al.\nIn 1985 van der Heide et al [86] performed ellipsometric spectroscopy on two Ni3Al alloys. One of the\nsamples was an 8mm polycrystalline sample and the other a 3mm single crystal. The sample size\nlimited the accuracy of the results they obtained at energies greater than approximately 5.5eV and hence\ntheir measurements extend only from 0.5eV to 5.5eV. They report no noticeable difference between the\noptical measurements of the two samples.\nThe most interesting feature in the spectra is a peak in \u03b5 \u2032\u2032 from about 2.5eV to about 4.5eV. This peak\npushes the real part of the permittivity above 0 resulting in two bulk plasmons, one at 3.4eV and\nanother at 3.9eV. An analysis of the infrared Drude tail showed that in the absence of interband\ntransitions the sample would exhibit a bulk plasmon at approximately 9eV (which is quite close to the\nbulk plasmon of nickel at 10 eV [73]). Unfortunately due to a high damping frequency, the Drude\ncontribution to \u03b5 \u2032\u2032 grows rapidly at visible wavelengths. Van der Heide et al also calculated that\ninterband transitions appear at the optical conductivity from approximately 1eV in Ni3Al and claim that\nearly onset interband transitions are common in d-metals. A comparison of the optical conductivity with\nthe Joint Density of States (JDOS) per energy level showed remarkable similarity in their results. This\nis particularly surprising as they leave the transition matrix elements constant. This means that the\n\n\fheights of the peaks that are evident in the JDOS/\u03c9 are arbitrary, even when compared across the\nspectrum.\nFurther investigations by Rhee et al showed an increase in interband transitions with non-stoichiometric\nconcentrations as well as increased transition strength with ferromagnetism and temperature [rhee1997,\nrhee2003]. Rhee et al also note that the transitions at 4 eV originate from bands near M along \u03a3 rather\nthan around \u0393 as reported by [86]. A reduced transition strength is reported by Hsu et al [87], which\ncauses the real part of the permittivity to be positive for energies above 2.4 eV. They attribute this to a\nsuperior sample surface.\nHsu and Wang [87] recently calculated the optical properties of the alloys Ni3Al, Ni3Ga and Ni3In using\nDFT with a FP-LAPW basis. They calculated interband transitions between 0eV and 150eV however\nno \u03b5 \u2032 results are presented. In similar fashion to the lattice constants reported for the group-13 gold\nalloys, the Ni3Al and Ni3Ga lattice constants are quite similar at 3.571 and 3.589 and the Ni3In lattice\nconstant is 3.745 about 5% greater than Ni3Al. The optical calculations overestimate the magnitude of\nboth the 1.0 eV and 2.0 eV transitions in Ni3Al, the 1.25 eV transition in Ni3Ga and all transitions in\nNi3In. Notably, the minimum in the experimental \u03b5 \u2032\u2032 for Ni3In occurs at 1.35 eV and has a value of 0.5;\nat this energy the real part has value of -3.5, giving a QLSP of 7.\nThe Laves phase (MgCu2 structure) Lanthanide group 13 intermetallics LaAl2 CeAl2 PrAl2 YbAl2 all\nhave f-states very close to the Fermi energy. Interaction with conduction states results in a low energy\nthreshold for interband transitions [lange2000, lee2000]. However, the compounds YAl2 LuAl2 have\ntheir f-states centered well above and well below the Fermi energy respectively, resulting in the main\ninterband transition occurring at approximately 2 eV. None of these materials have QLSP>1. The AuCu3\ncompound LuAl3 also has high lying f-states, and the density of states at the Fermi energy of YbAl3 is\nnearly twice as large compared to ScLa3 and LuAl3 because of partially occupied f-states, but interband\ntransitions cause the compound to have no metallic character between 1.5 eV and 5.5 eV [92].\n\n4.4 Other Binary Intermetallics\n\nIn LaSn3 the onset of interband transitions occurs at approximately 0.5 eV with the main peak at\napproximately 1.5 eV [93]. All the transitions between 1 eV and 5 eV can be explained due to the\nmixing of 4f character into states near the Fermi energy, with the dominant transition mechanism\narising from La 5d to hybrid f-d-p states [93]. In CeSn3 the situation is even worse due to increasing 4f\ncharacter of conduction states, which causes partial occupation of f-d-p states allowing for additional\ntransition mechanisms. ThPd3 and UPd3 both exhibit the TiNi3 structure, UPd3 having partially\noccupied 5f-states and ThPd3 having completely unoccupied 5f-states; the onset of interband transitions\nin both materials is < 1 eV [94]. The interband component of the optical spectra for all these materials is\ntoo great to allow for reasonable plasmonic activity.\n4.5 Ternary Intermetallics\n\nMgAuSn exhibits the cubic AlLiSi structure (F43m) and is coloured purple due mainly to very strong\ninterband transitions around 3 eV [95]. The transitions are likely due to the parallel band effect which\ngives aluminium its strong interband component at 1.5 eV. Because the transition in MgAuSn becomes\nsteep at a higher energy, and the material has a lower effective Drude plasma frequency, KramersKronig integration forces the real part of the permittivity into the positive over the region 2.2 eV to 3.1\neV. Interband transitions were calculated using the tight-binding linear muffin orbital (TB-LMTO)\n\n\fmethod within the local density approximation. Intraband contributions were included by fitting a\nDrude damping constant and plasma frequency to experimental data.\nThe optical properties of the magnetic Heusler alloy Cu2MnAl have been calculated using a tight\nbinding plane wave [96]. Generally reasonable accord between experiment and theory was apparent\nbelow 3.5 eV which included the two main features at 1.5 eV and 2.7 eV. The feature at 1.5 eV also\nbears similarity to the low energy transition in aluminium, and the 2.7 eV peak is reported to arise from\ntransitions between hybridised conduction bands. Additional studies by Kudryavtsev et al [97] suggest\nthat QLSP is greater than 1 for frequencies below 1 eV. Damping to plasma frequency ratios of between\n8.85 and 10.7 have been measured in samples of Ni2MnGa depending on the annealing temperature [98]\nhowever both Ni2MnGa and Ni2MnIn [99] have large low energy interband transitions. Fe2TiAl has a\nplasma frequency of 0.22 eV [100], lower than the value of 1.32 eV for Fe2VGa, which gives a\nreasonable \u03c9 p / \u03b3 value of 29 [101], however interband transitions cover most of the spectrum,\ndisrupting quality.\nThe most promising of all the alloys studied here is Li2AgIn alloy. It crystallizes in the NaTl-type\nstructure (Zintl Phase), with 16 atoms per unit cell such that a group of 8 BCC cells make up a cube.\nThe corner atoms of each BCC cell are composed of alternating lithium and indium atoms and the\ncenters of alternating BCC cells are lithium and silver atoms. Zwilling et al [102] report some very\ninteresting results for this compound, the most surprising of which is that at exactly 2 eV the imaginary\npart of the permittivity is zero. A material such as this would have phenomenal optical properties, most\nnotably, an infinitely sharp resonance. Of course, such a resonance is not really possible, and 'very\nlarge' will have to suffice. The real part of the permittivity at 2 eV is also reported by Zwilling et al\n[102] and a value of -16 is given. Zwilling et al determined the complex permittivity by ellipsometry.\nTheir samples were prepared by melting the constituent metals in various ratios in a furnace at 1000\u25e6 C.\nThe concentration of lithium remained constant while the silver and indium concentrations obeyed the\nformula Ag2\u2212x Inx . At x = 1, \u03b5 \u2032\u2032 in Li2AgIn is at a minimum of 0.0 at 2.0 eV. In Li2Ag0.50In1.50 the\nminimum in \u03b5 \u2032\u2032 increases to above 4, shifts to lower energies and the gradient of the real part becomes\nless negative. Unfortunately, in the same work, Zwilling et al report the optical properties of Li2CdIn.\nAccording to their data, the imaginary part of the permittivity reaches -2 at approximately -3.1 eV. This\nviolates causality and cannot be correct. It is possible that the cause for this error lies in the\nextrapolation regime they use in conjunction with the Kramers-Kronig relations, but no reference is\nmade. Overall, this indicates that the proximity of \u03b5 \u2032\u2032 to zero for Li2AgIn should be discounted, but not\nignored.\nWe recently [71] calculated the interband component of the imaginary permittivity for a series of\nmaterials in the series Alkali2-Noble-Group 13 and Alkali-Noble2-Group 13, with the alkali metals\nconsisting of Li, Na and K, the noble metals Ag and Au and the group 13 metals Al, Ga and In. Figure 3\ncompares the imaginary permittivity measured by Zwilling et al with calculated interband imaginary\npermittivity values of our previous work [71] no Drude intraband term is included.\n\n\fFigure 3. Experimental imaginary permittivity of Zwilling et al [102] for Li2AgIn (solid line) and Li2AgCd (dash\ndot line). Note the non causal region between 2.9 eV and 3.2 eV. Calculated interband imaginary permittivity of\nBlaber et al [71] for Li2AgIn (dashed line) shows the permittivity not going to zero.\n\nIn conclusion, the plasmonic quality of intermetallic compounds is heavily reliant on the complexity of\nthe band structure. Interband transitions dominate in materials with large numbers of atoms in the unit\ncell. If alternative plasmonic materials are going to be realized in the form of intermetallics, binary\ncompounds with only two atoms in the primitive cell that have low lying d-states are most likely to be\ncompetitive.\n5. Silicides\nSilicides present an interesting alternative to metals for use in plasmonics. Due to extensive use in\nmetal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) their optical and electrical\ncharacteristics have been widely studied (for a review of their application to MOSFETs see [103]).\nMoreover, as most of the studied silicides grow epitaxially on silicon, current and future semiconductor\nmanufacturing techniques can be directly applied to the creation of sub-10nm plasmonic devices. In fact\ndevice structures amenable to on chip plasmonic information transfer such as nanowires have already\nbeen created from silicides [jiang2009, song2007, zhang2006]. Recently, Soref et al [104] have\nproposed the use of Pd2Si as an alternative to gold in SPP based plasmonic devices. They argue that as\nlong as on chip transport requirements are met (i.e. high speed, small size, low loss) then the operating\nwavelength of the system is irrelevant. To ensure that the mode confinement is reasonable the longest\noperating wavelength is chosen such that field emanating from the waveguide penetrates no greater than\nthree wavelengths on the air exposed side. Unfortunately, they mistakenly divide all the penetration\nlengths by a factor of 2\u03c0 , causing the operating wavelength to be at very low frequencies, where in\nfact the penetration length reaches hundreds of microns. Nonetheless, their criterion is a good one and\nwe shall use it to assess the plasmonic performance of a number of silicides.\nThe penetration depth of the tangential component of a surface plasmon polariton traveling along a\nmetallic strip surrounded by air can be approximated by:\n\nLpen =\n\n\u03bb\nRe[ \u2212 1 /(\u03b5 (\u03c9 ) + 1) ]\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u03bb = c / \u03c9 . Enforcing the condition Lpen / \u03bb = 3 for a Drude metal reduces to \u03b5 \u2032(\u03c9 ) \u2248 \u221210 . The\npropagation length of such a mode is:\n\n\f1\n\nLprop =\n\n2 Im[\u03bb \u03b5 (\u03c9 ) /(\u03b5 (\u03c9 ) + 1) ]\nWhere the frequency is (for a Drude metal):\n\n\u03c9=\n\n.\n\n(14)\n\n\u03b3 2 (1 \u2212 \u03b5 \u2032) \u2212 \u03c9 2p\n\u03b5 \u2032 \u22121\n\n(15)\n\nA summary of the optical properties of some silicides is presented in table 2. We have included the SPP\nquality factor at the telecommunications wavelength of 1.5 \u03bcm . For comparison, the value for silver is\nmax\n4522 [30]. We previously noted (see Section 1.2) that a Drude model is sufficient to describe QSPP\nas\nlong as the plasma frequency is much larger than the scattering rate - this is of course arises from a\nsignificant contribution to the real part of the permittivity that drowns out the effect of interband\nadditions to the imaginary part and any residual effect on the polarizibility that these transitions may\nincur. However, all the silicides presented in table 2 have small plasma frequency to damping ratios\ncompared to silver and gold. The data for TiSi2 is derived from the plasma frequency and DC\nresistivity, and although most of the scattering rates calculated from DC resistivity measurements are\nvery close to those extracted from optical data, there is no a priori way of estimating the error. More\nrecent optical constants by Kudryavtsev et al [105] for TiSi2 reduces QSPP at 1.5 um to 27, down from\n1348.\n\nTable 2.

The Fe1-xSix compound studied by Kim et al [107] (figure 4) shows decreasing\nmetallicity with increasing silicon concentration as the density of conduction electrons decreases, this\n\n\fcauses a decrease in the SPP properties of FeSi. However, increasing silicon concentration also screens\ninterband transitions, and for some frequencies and compositions, the LSP quality is greater than that of\npure iron.\n\nFigure 4. Quality factors for surface plasmons in the structure Fe1-xSix\n\nIn figure 5 we present experimental QSPP data collated by Nava et al [106] and compare it to the Drude\nmodel for which optical constants are presented in table 2. Due to the distinct lack of agreement\nbetween experimental optical constants and the Drude model for these compounds, or the requirement\nof frequency-dependent scattering rates, we strongly discourage its use, even at very long wavelengths.\n\nFigure 5. Local surface plasmon quality factors for group 5 transition metal silicides. Black lines: experimental\ndata collated by [106], blue lines: Drude model using parameters from table 2.\n\nThe alkali metal silicides have been shown to be semiconductors [108]. The alkaline earth metal\nsilicides exhibit poor metal characteristics (eg CaSi \u03c1 DC =282 \u03bc\u03a9cm [109]) semiconductors eg BaSi2\n[110] and reasonable metallic character (eg CaSi2 \u03c1 DC =32 \u03bc\u03a9cm [109]). Some of the rare earth\nsilicides are metallic, such as GdSi [111] and ErSi [wetzei1991, angot1999] albeit with exceptionally\npoor plasma frequency to damping ratios ( \u03c9 p / \u03b3 \u2248 1 ) whereas others are semiconductors such as EuSi\nand YbSi [112].\n\n\fFigure 6. Experimental imaginary permittivity of cobalt silicides in various stoichiometries. Data from\nKudryavtsev et al [113] and Wu [114].\n\nIn summary, although the silicides offer considerable technological conveniences and some of them are\npotential candidates for guiding long wavelengths (e.g. TiSi2), they are generally poor when compared\nto other materials and are not suitable for LSP applications.\n6. High Pressure Materials\nMetals and alloys under pressure has become a very popular topic. Pressure and phase transformations\ndrastically alter the electronic properties of materials, shifting optical gaps, the plasma frequency as\nwell as modifying electron-phonon and electron-electron scattering.\nStructural phase transitions, electronic topology transitions and metal-insulator transitions in systems\nunder high pressure open the doors to whole new world of materials for plasmonics. We shall briefly\ndiscuss some of these properties, with a focus on pressures sustainable in active devices.\nPotentially, an increase in pressure can increase the plasma frequency meeting one of our criteria for a\ngood plasmonic material. However, increasing the band gradient at the Fermi surface, and the\npossibility of overhauling the topology of the Fermi surface due to pressure induced electron transfer\nfrom one band to another can dramatically alter the electron phonon coupling, and hence have a\ndetrimental impact on the phenomenological relaxation time. This change in topology, where\npreviously unoccupied bands cross the Fermi energy is known as an Electronic Topology Transition\n(ETT). Such transitions can have positive and negative effects. The effects of pressure on the alkali\nmetals has become an exciting topic due to the discovery of novel phase transitions[115], some of\nwhich are superconducting (see e.g. [116] and [117]).\nThe band edge in lithium can be shifted from 3 eV to almost 7 eV by the application of pressures as low\nas 40 GPa [118]. The magnitude of the band edge is increased from 1.75 in the BCC phase to\napproximately 2.75 for the FCC and hR1 phases. The FCC phase has a screened plasma frequency to\noptical gap ratio greater than 1[119].\nThe introduction of pressure on K causes a more substantial increase in the interband contribution to the\n\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9 g ) increases from less than 1 at 2.2 eV to greater than 7 when the crystal volume is\npermittivity; \u03b5 ib\nreduced to 45% of the ground state volume [120]. Gao et al have studied an anomaly in the resistivity\n\n\fof SC calcium[121]. They note that the resistance anomaly in SC calcium that occurs at approximately\n40 GPa can be attributed to an increase in the electron phonon matrix element and an increase in the\nplasma frequency due to an ETT from 4s to 3d states. The pressure dependence of the plasma frequency\nfor some alkali, noble and group 13 elements is shown in figure 7, although we can expect an increase\nin plasmonic quality with increased plasma frequency, the technical difficulty of operating a plasmonic\nsystem under pressure negates any (minor) increases in quality. Additionally, in many cases additional\npressure increases resistivity [122].\n\nFigure 7. The effect of pressure on the plasma frequency of some metals studied by Sundqvist [123].\n\nrs is the\n\neffective radius for an atom in the unit cell. Pressure increases to the right.\n\nETTs in the Noble-Group 13 intermetallics AuX2 under pressure cause additional transition\nmechanisms at the high symmetry points in the Brillouin zone, presumably reducing the resonance\nquality [124].\nIn summary, although topological changes under high-pressure offer the chance to drastically alter\nmaterial properties, and some of them may exhibit increased plasmon quality (e.g. in Li), others are\ndegraded (K). Further, the pressure required is impractical (although not impossible).\n7. Liquid Metals and Glassy/Amorphous Materials\nFor any purely amorphous system, the concept of k-space is ill-defined, and as such the difference\nbetween interband and intraband transitions disappears resulting in a smearing of the band edge.\nUsually, the smearing occurs down to zero frequency as transitions which are forbidden in the\ncrystalline state become possible with increasing amorphicity. As such, the optical properties of such\nsystems should be well described by the Drude model with a high damping frequency. There are some\nserious disadvantages to using liquid metals and amorphous alloys in plasmonics, notably, the generally\nhigh temperature required to have a metal in a liquid state, and the difficulty in depositing nanopatterned amorphous films. Nonetheless, we shall see that liquid sodium has quite amenable optical\nproperties, and the amorphous silicide PdSi may be useful in plasmonic devices.\n7.1 Liquid Metals\nThe reduced order and increased temperature evident in liquid metals has the effect of shifting the\ninterband transitions to lower energies as they are broadened in a similar fashion to amorphous\ncompounds with the additional drawback of increased electron-electron scattering rate due to increased\ntemperature. Although one would not expect interband transitions in the optical spectra of liquid metals\n\n\fdue to disruption to the periodic potential, even short range order in liquid metals is sufficient to\nobserve interband transitions.\nThe quality factors Q LSP and QSPP are presented for liquid and solid Na in figure 8a using the data of\nInagaki et al [inagaki1976liquid, inagaki1976solid]. Of all the materials in this review, liquid sodium is\nthe first material to exhibit superior plasmonic properties compared to its standard state elemental\ncounterpart. Ingaki et al measure the optical constants under a pressure of 2x10-9 Torr and at a constant\ntemperature of 120oC to minimize vaporization. Once the sodium was melted, an oxide coating on the\nsample was removed in situ by the use of a stainless steel scraper. The Maximum QLSP of liquid Na is\n42.1 [51], whereas for solid Na it is 41.1, and the frequency at which this maximum occurs increases in\nliquid Na to 2.3 eV from 1.3 eV in the solid. From these parameters for liquid Na we can calculate the\nscattering rate and plasma frequency for a Drude metal: \u03b3 = 0.038 eV and \u03c9 p = 4.16 eV. There are\nremnants of the band edge evident in the liquid phase [51], albeit with much reduced magnitude, and a\nslight shift to higher energies. Helman and Baltensperger [125] argue that this apparent interband\ncomponent can be explained by frequency dependent scattering due to ion-electron interactions.\n\nFigure 8. Optical data for A) sodium [inagaki1976liquid, inagaki1976solid] and B) aluminum[126, 127]. Data\nfor solid phase (squares) and liquid phase (circles). Filled symbols represent Q LSP data and open symbols\nrepresent QSPP data.\n\nQLSP data by Krishnan and Nordine [126] for liquid Al is presented in figure 6b alongside the data for\nthe solid state by Shiles et al [127]. The 1.5 eV transition is shifted to lower energies, and there is a\nnoticeable increase in the scattering rate which is not evident in liquid Na. Additionally, the plasma\nfrequency reduces with increasing temperature [128].\nAl-Ga and Au-Ga nanocomposites have been employed in high speed modulation of surface plasmon\npolaritons. The functionality arises from a heating effect in the composite that causes a structural\ntransformation in the gallium [6, 129, 130]. A comparison of local and propagating plasmon modes for\nliquid and solid gallium is presented in figure 9. Liquid gallium has a significantly superior optical\nresponse over the solid phase for a very large wavelength range (100 nm to 20 \u03bcm ). The maximum\n\nQSPP is 185 at 1.77 \u03bcm .\n\n\fThe band edge in liquid silver shifts to higher energies, the onset of interband transitions is not as steep\nin the liquid phase, and the maximum of the band edge is at 4.5 eV. In copper, the band edge broadens\nand shifts to lower energies. Both materials have increased scattering rates [131].\nThe scattering rate in liquid Pb and Sn is an order of magnitude greater than in the solid state [132]. The\nmaximum QLSP measured for liquid Pb is 1.38 at 3.7 eV, more than 4 times lower than the solid\n[133].Similarly, Bi has maximum Q LSP of 0.7, 5 times lower than the solid [133].\nMercury and liquid mercury-indium alloys were studied by Hodgson [134]. The scattering rate\nincreases from 1.44 eV to 1.72 eV when the temperature of elemental mercury is increased from 20 C\nto 200 C. Adding indium to liquid mercury steadily decreases the scattering rate at 20 C and can reach\nvalues of 0.8 eV with 33.4 at.% indium.\n\nFigure 9. Optical data for solid [135] and liquid [136] gallium A) Q LSP data B) QSPP data.\n\nBoth silicon and germanium exhibit the free electron like Drude tail in the liquid phase at the\nmoderately impractical temperatures of 1600K and 1300K. Fuchs [137] has compared experimental and\ncalculated data for liquid silicon prepared in a variety of ways, and some of the data shows QLSP can\ntake values greater than 1 at energies above 4 eV.\n\n7.2 Amorphous/Glassy Alloys\nAmorphous Au1-xSix [138, 139] was the first material discovered to have a damping frequency greater\nthan the optical gap, resulting in exceptionally poor optical properties. The summary of the maximum\nQLSP and the frequency at which it occurs is presented in figure 10.\n\n\fFigure 10. Maximum QLSP for a variety of metallic glasses using plasma frequencies and drude damping\nparameters collated by Mitzutani [140]. The materials have varying stoichiometries defined by AxB100-x. The AuSi\n[138] and AuGe have x=75 and x=70.\n\nWith the exception of amorphous PdSi and amorphous Ga, a majority of the glasses reviewed by\nMitzutani [140] in figure 10 have poor optical properties.\nThe optical constants of the amorphous alloys of AgxSn1-x and AuxSn1-x were measured at a single\nwavelength by Loistl and Baumann [141]. They approximate the intraband damping parameter and\nshow that it is greatest at x=0.5 for AuSn and x=0.66 for AgSn, reaching values of 2.1 eV in both cases,\nindicating some sort of additional order at these stoichiometries where chemical bonding begins to\noccur. Similar effects occur in liquid CsAu, MbBi and LiBi (see [142]).\nAmorphous NiP alloys were studied by McKnight et al [143]. They show that in the amorphous phase\ninterband transitions are shifted to higher energies with increasing phosphorous content. Unfortunately,\nalthough the scattering rate reduces with increasing P, the plasma frequency also decreases. The\nrelationship between the square of the plasma frequency and the scattering rate is linear for P\nconcentrations below about 20 % indicating additional scattering mechanisms begin to appear at these\nconcentrations. In CoP [144] any alloying with phosphorous causes the low energy transition in Co to\nbecome unresolvable.\nAmorphous Ti and Mo disilicides have inferior plasmonic properties compared to the crystalline\ncompounds studied in section 5 [105]. Amorphous Fe and Cr have a smaller interband component than\nthe crystalline versions, but Kudryavtsev et al [105] report no data for the real part of the permittivity.\nSummarizing, amorphous and liquid materials exhibit smeared interbands which reduces their impact.\nHowever, since most metals require higher temperature to exist as a liquid, electron-electron scattering\nis typically increased. For most amorphous and liquid materials we surveyed plasmonic performance is\nworse, however liquid phase Na and Ga exhibit increased performance over their solid state\ncounterparts.\n8. Conclusions\nWe have discussed the optical performance of some different types of materials - including the\nelemental metals, alloys, intermetallics, silicides \u2013 as well as high-pressure and amorphous phases. The\nsilicides and many of the alloys studied here have partially occupied d-bands that adversely affect their\nplasmonic performance. However, dopants may be introduced to disrupt the low energy transitions,\ngiving an overall increase in plasmonic quality. The silicides as well as most liquid and amorphous\n\n\fmaterials and doped materials have very large Drude phenomenological scattering rates. We showed\nthat the plasma frequency and band edge of some materials could be shifted substantially with the\naddition of pressure, however, plasmonic devices working under 40 GPa of pressure is a scientific\ncuriosity at best, and practical applications are difficult to envision. We note the very interesting optical\nproperties of liquid sodium and gallium, and would be very interested in the optical properties of the\nNaK eutectic, which has a melting point of -30\u00b0C.\nWe conclude that intermetallic compounds are most likely to offer an alternative to silver and gold for\nplasmonic applications. Materials with simple crystal structures and low lying d-states, are most likely\nto perform well.\nAppendix A\n\nTable A.1) References for the optical properties of the elements presented in Figure 1.
