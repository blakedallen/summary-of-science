In this paper we study orthogonal polynomials\nwith respect to the exponential weight e\u2212N Vt (x) where N \u2208 N, in cases where\nt is negative. Since for negative t integrals like\nZ\nxk e\u2212N Vt (x) dx\nR\n\nare divergent, we will have to define what we mean by orthogonal polynomials\nin this case. Before doing so, and in order to motivate what we are going to\ndo, we discuss the case t \u2265 0 first.\nFor t \u2265 0, the monic orthogonal polynomial \u03c0n of degree n \u2208 N satisfies\nZ\n\u03c0n (x)xk e\u2212N Vt (x) dx = 0,\n(1.2)\nR\n\nfor k = 0, 1, . . . , n \u2212 1. An important feature of these polynomials is that the\nrecurrence coefficients an in the three term recurrence \u03c0n+1 (x) = x\u03c0n (x) \u2212\nan \u03c0n\u22121 (x) satisfied by these polynomials satisfy\nan + tan (an\u22121 + an + an+1 ) =\n\nn\n.\nN\n\n(1.3)\n\nThe nonlinear difference equation (1.3) is referred to as the string equation\nor the Freud equation. It is also known as an example of a discrete Painlev\u00e9\nequation, see [27] and the references cited therein. Of course the polynomials\n\u03c0n as well as the recurrence coefficients an depend on N and t. If we want\nto emphasize this dependence we write \u03c0n,N,t and an,N (t).\nAn important tool in the study of the asymptotic behavior of \u03c0n,n,t and\nan,n (t) as n \u2192 \u221e is played by the equilibrium measure in the external field\nVt [29]. This is the unique Borel probability measure \u03bc = \u03bct on R that\nminimizes\nZZ\nZ\n1\nlog\nIVt (\u03bc) =\nd\u03bc(x)d\u03bc(y) + Vt (x)d\u03bc(x)\n(1.4)\n|x \u2212 y|\n2\n\n\famong all Borel probability measures on R. The measure \u03bct can be calculated\nexplicitly. It is supported on the interval [\u2212ct , ct ] where\nc2t =\nand it has a density given by\n\nwhere\n\n\u0011\n2 \u0010\u221a\n1 + 12t \u2212 1 ,\n3t\n\np\nd\u03bct\nt 2\n=\n(x \u2212 d2t ) c2t \u2212 x2 ,\ndx\n2\u03c0\n\nfor x \u2208 [\u2212ct , ct ],\n\n(1.5)\n\n(1.6)\n\n\u0011\n1 \u0010\u221a\n(1.7)\n1 + 12t + 2 .\n3t\nThe formula (1.7) may look a bit awkward since d2t < 0 for t > 0, but we\nhave written it this way, since we will mainly use (1.7) for t < 0 and then\nd2t > 0.\nThe limiting behavior of the recurrence coefficients an,n (t) as n \u2192 \u221e is\ndirectly related to the support [\u2212ct , ct ] of the equilibrium measure, since we\nhave for t \u2265 0 that\n\u221a\nc2t\n1 + 12t \u2212 1\n\u22121\nan,n (t) =\n+ O(n ) =\n+ O(n\u22121 )\n(1.8)\n4\n6t\nd2t = \u2212\n\nas n \u2192 \u221e. The asymptotics (1.8) follows from far more general results in [11]\nwhere it is also shown that O(1/n) term can be written as a full asymptotic\nexpansion in powers of 1/n.\n\n1.2\n\nCritical behavior of recurrence coefficients\n\nAs said before, we are going to consider the case t < 0. Although in this\ncase the orthogonal polynomials are not well-defined by (1.2), the Freud\nequation (1.3) makes perfect sense. If t \u2265 \u22121/12 also the measure (1.6)\nwith ct > 0 and dt > 0 given by (1.5) and (1.7) is well-defined and gives\na probability measure on R. This measure does not minimize (1.4) among\nall Borel probability measure on R (in fact there is no such minimizer), but\nit does minimize (1.4) among all Borel probability measures on [\u2212ct , ct ], or\namong all Borel probability measures on the larger interval [\u2212dt , dt ]. The\nvalue t = \u22121/12 is critical, since for t < \u22121/12 the measure (1.6) is not\n3\n\n\fwell-defined anymore. Note that for t = tcr = \u22121/12, we have c2t = d2t = 8\nand we find the critical measure \u03bc\u22121/12 = \u03bccr where\nd\u03bccr\n1\n=\n(8 \u2212 x2 )3/2 ,\ndx\n24\u03c0\n\n\u221a \u221a\nfor x \u2208 [\u2212 8, 8].\n\n(1.9)\n\nBy formal calculations based on the Freud equation (1.3) it was shown\nin the physics literature, see e.g. the surveys [15, 16], that the recurrence\ncoefficients an,n (t) have very interesting limit behavior as n \u2192 \u221e for t near\nthe critical value tcr = \u22121/12. Namely, if t depends on n and tends to tcr as\nn \u2192 \u221e in such a way that\nn4/5 (t \u2212 tcr ) = \u2212c1 x\n\n(1.10)\n\nlim n2/5 (an,n (t) \u2212 2) = c2 y(x)\n\n(1.11)\n\nremains fixed, then\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nwhere y(x) is a solution of the Painlev\u00e9 I equation\ny \u2032\u2032 = 6y 2 + x.\n\n(1.12)\n\nIn (1.10) and (1.11) we have that c1 and c2 are certain explicit positive\nconstants.\nIn two very important papers [18, 19] Fokas, Its, and Kitaev were able\nto prove this result in a mathematically rigorous way. First of all they made\nit clear how the orthogonal polynomials with respect to e\u2212N Vt (x) should be\ndefined in case t < 0. The solution is to consider the orthogonality not on\nR but on a contour \u0393 in the complex plane chosen so that Re Vt (z) \u2192 +\u221e\nas z \u2192 \u221e along the contour. For symmetry reasons they chose a contour\n\u0393 that consists of the two lines parametrized by z = rei\u03c0/4 and z = re\u2212i\u03c0/4\nwith \u2212\u221e < r < \u221e. Then the orthogonality property for the polynomials \u03c0n\nis\nZ\n\u03c0n (z)z k e\u2212N Vt (z) dz = 0,\nfor k = 0, 1, . . . , n \u2212 1,\n(1.13)\n\u0393\n\nand the integrals are well-defined. Note that the bilinear form\nZ\nhp, qi = p(z)q(z)e\u2212N Vt (z) dz\n\u0393\n\n4\n\n(1.14)\n\n\fis not positive definite, so that (1.17) is an example of non-Hermitian orthogonality. As a result it is not automatic that a unique monic polynomial \u03c0n of\ndegree n exists that satisfies (1.13). However, it follows from the analysis of\n[18, 19] that in the asymptotic regime given by (1.10) the monic polynomials \u03c0n+1,n,t , \u03c0n,n,t, \u03c0n\u22121,n,t exist for n large enough, they satisfy a three-term\nrecurrence relation with recurrence coefficient an,n (t) that satisfies (1.11) for\na uniquely specified solution y(x) of the Painlev\u00e9 I equation (1.12).\nThe analysis in [18, 19] is based on a characterization of the orthogonal\npolynomials by a Riemann-Hilbert problem. The Riemann-Hilbert problem\nadmits a Lax pair formulation, and the Freud equation for the recurrence\ncoefficients follows from the compability equation for the Lax pair. In [18] the\nPainlev\u00e9 I asymptotic behavior is proved via a WKB analysis of the RiemannHilbert problem and the associated Lax pair. It is interesting to note that\nthe Riemann-Hilbert problem for orthogonal polynomials was stated for the\nfirst time in [19]. It should also be noted that [19] is not restricted to the\nquartic potential (1.1) but more general polynomial potentials are considered\nas well.\nSubsequent developments in the asymptotic analysis of Riemann-Hilbert\nproblems made us consider this problem again. The main new development\nis the application of the powerful Deift/Zhou steepest descent analysis for\nRiemann-Hilbert problems [14] to the Riemann-Hilbert problem for orthogonal polynomials by Deift et al. [12, 11] which had a major impact on the\nasymptotic theory of orthogonal polynomials.\nIn this paper we give an alternative proof of the Painlev\u00e9 I asymptotics\nusing these new techniques. The proof we thus obtain is a direct proof, in\nthe sense that the analysis only deals with the Riemann-Hilbert problem\nand not the Lax pair. We derive asymptotics for the recurrence coefficients\nwithout considering the Freud equation in an explicit way. For clarity of\npresentation we restrict ourselves to the quartic potential (1.1) but extension\nto more general potentials is possible.

Not all choices of weights are\nrelevant. We impose \u03b11 + \u03b14 = 1 and \u03b12 + \u03b13 = 1. Then putting \u03b1 = \u03b11\nand \u03b2 = \u03b13 we obtain the situation indicated in Figure 1.

The bn coefficient\nvanishes only if \u03b1 = \u03b2, since then the bilinear form is even. In that case\nan satisfies the Freud equation (1.3). For \u03b1 6= \u03b2 the bilinear form is not\neven and we have the general three-term recurrence (1.18). Then (1.3) is\nnot satisfied, but instead the an and bn satisfy a more complicated system of\nnonlinear difference equations.\nWe use an,N (t) and bn,N (t) to indicate the dependence on N and t. The\nrecurrence coefficients also depend on \u03b1 and \u03b2 but we will not indicate that\nin the notation.\nThe regular case \u22121/12 < t < 0\nWe refer to the case where t is fixed with \u22121/12 < t < 0 as the regular\ncase. In the regular case we will find that the asymptotic formula for an,n (t)\nis a straightforward continuation of the one valid for t \u2265 0, see (1.8). In\naddition, the recurrence coefficient bn,n (t) is exponentially small. This is our\nfirst result.\nTheorem 1.1. Let \u22121/12 < t < 0 be fixed.

It is only in\nthe critical case that the dependence on the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 plays a role.\nIn our main result (Theorem 1.2 below) we will give asymptotic formulas for\nan,n (t) and bn,n (t) as n \u2192 \u221e in terms of special solutions y\u03b1 and y\u03b2 of the\nPainlev\u00e9 I equation (1.12). We describe these special solutions first.\nSolutions y\u03b1 of the Painlev\u00e9 I equation\nTo explain how the solution y\u03b1 depends on \u03b1 we recall the Riemann-Hilbert\nproblem associated with Painlev\u00e9 I. Let \u03a8(\u03b6; x) be a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix valued\nfunction that is analytic in the complex \u03b6-plane except for jumps on the\ncontours arg \u03b6 = \u00b12\u03c0/5, arg \u03b6 = \u00b14\u03c0/5, and arg \u03b6 = \u03c0. The contours are\noriented as in Figure 2. The orientation induces a + and \u2212 side on each part\nof the contour, where the + side (\u2212 side) is on the left (right) if one traverses\nthe contour according to the orientation. For \u03b6 on the contour the limiting\n\n8\n\n\fvalues \u03a6\u00b1 (\u03b6; x) from both sides exist and are connected by\n\u03a8+ (\u03b6; x) = \u03a8\u2212 (\u03b6; x)A\u03b1\nwhere the jump matrices A\u03b1 are given in Figure 2. Furthermore, \u03a8 has\nasymptotics\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u03b6 \u03c33 /4 1 \u2212i\n\u03a81 (x) \u03a82 (x)\n\u22123/2\n\u03a8(\u03b6; x) = \u221a\n+ O(\u03b6\n) e\u03b8(\u03b6,x)\u03c33 , (1.21)\nI + 1/2 +\n1\ni\n\u03b6\n\u03b6\n2\n0\nfor \u03b6 \u2192 \u221e, where \u03c33 = ( 10 \u22121\n) and \u03b8 is defined by\n\n4\n\u03b8(\u03b6, x) = \u03b6 5/2 + x\u03b6 1/2 .\n5\n\n(1.22)\n\ny\u03b1 (x) = 2i (\u03a82 (x))12\n\n(1.23)\n\nThen it is known that\nis a solution of the Painlev\u00e9 I equation, and it is this solution y\u03b1 that will\nappear in our main result below.\nAs is the case for any solution of the Painlev\u00e9 I equation we have that y\u03b1\nis a meromorphic function with an infinite number of poles in the complex\nplane. The Riemann-Hilbert problem for \u03a8 has a solution if and only if x is\nnot a pole of y\u03b1 .\nThe above Riemann-Hilbert problem does not generate all solutions of\nthe Painlev\u00e9 I equation, but only those solutions that satisfy\np\ny(x) = \u2212x/6(1 + o(1))\nas x \u2192 \u2212\u221e.\n(1.24)\nAll y\u03b1 satisfy (1.24) and they have a common asymptotic series\n#\n\"\n\u221e\nX\np\ny\u03b1 (x) \u223c \u2212x/6 1 +\nas x \u2192 \u2212\u221e\nak (\u2212x)\u22125k/2\n\n(1.25)\n\nk=1\n\nfor certain coefficients ak .\nFor the special value \u03b1 = 1 we have that the asymptotic series (1.25) is\nvalid as |x| \u2192 \u221e with arg x \u2208 [3\u03c0/5, \u03c0].

Let \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 C, and let t vary with n such that\nn4/5 (t + 1/12) = \u2212c1 x,\n\nc1 = 2\u22129/5 3\u22126/5 ,\n\n(1.27)\n\nremains fixed, where x is not a pole of y\u03b1 and y\u03b2 . Then, for large enough n,\nthe recurrence coefficients an,n (t) and bn,n (t) associated with the orthogonal\npolynomials with respect to the bilinear form (1.16) exist and they satisfy\nan,n (t) = 2 \u2212 c2 (y\u03b1 (x) + y\u03b2 (x)) n\u22122/5 + O(n\u22123/5 ),\n\nc2 = 23/5 32/5 , (1.28)\n\nand\nbn,n (t) = c3 (y\u03b2 (x) \u2212 y\u03b1 (x)) n\u22122/5 + O(n\u22123/5 ),\n\nc3 = 21/10 32/5 ,\n\n(1.29)\n\nas n \u2192 \u221e. The expansions (1.28) and (1.29) hold uniformly for x in compact\nsubsets of R not containing any of the poles of y\u03b1 and y\u03b2 , and the O terms\ncan be expanded into a full asymptotic expansion in powers of n\u22121/5 .\nRemark 1.3. It is quite remarkable that we do not have a term of order\nn\u22121/5 in (1.28) and (1.29). The terms in these expansions ultimately come\nfrom the terms in the asymptotic expansion (1.21) of \u03a8(\u03b6; x), as we will show.\nTerms of order n\u22121/5 could have appeared because of the term \u03a81 (x)/\u03b6 1/2\nin (1.21). However, it turns out that the entries of \u03a81 (x) cancel out in the\ncalculations. These entries also do not contribute to the n\u22122/5 term.\nRemark 1.4. Not much is known about the precise location of the poles\nof y\u03b1 on the real line, however see [8, 21]. Because of (1.24) we know that\nthere can be only a finite number of poles on the negative real axis. Joshi\nand Kitaev [21, Prop. 3] showed that every real valued solution of (1.12) has\nat least one pole on the positive real axis, so this applies in particular to our\nsolutions y\u03b1 with Re \u03b1 = 1/2.\nRemark 1.5. Even though we will concentrate on the quartic potential, it\nwill be obvious that our method generalizes to higher degree potentials. The\nquartic potential serves as a generic example for all polynomial potentials\nfor which the density of an associated critical equilibrium measure vanishes\nwith an exponent 3/2 at the endpoints of the support as in (1.9).\n10\n\n\fNote that this type of vanishing is not possible in the case of usual orthogonality with respect to varying exponential weights on the real line, since\nthen it is only possible that the density of the equilibrium measure vanishes\nat an endpoint with an exponent (4k + 1)/2 with k \u2208 N0 . See [10, 11] for\nmore details. The generic case k = 0 leads to Airy functions. The first critical case k = 1 is described in terms of the second member of the Painlev\u00e9 I\nhierarchy [7].\nRemark 1.6. The general symmetric quartic potential V (x) = gx2 /2+tx4 /4\nexhibits another type of critical behavior for g < 0 and t > 0. Here the zeros\nof the orthogonal polynomial \u03c0n with respect to e\u2212nV (x) may accumulate\neither on one or on two intervals, depending on the values of g and t, and the\nsame holds true for the eigenvalues of the unitary random matrix ensemble\n(1/Zn )e\u2212n Tr V (M ) dM on n \u00d7 n Hermitian matrices M. Bleher and Its [2, 3]\nshowed that the transition is described by the Hastings-Mcleod solution of\nthe Painlev\u00e9 II equation. This result was generalized in [5, 6] to more general\npotentials.\nOverview of the rest of the paper\nThe proofs of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 are based on a steepest descent analysis\nof the RH problem that characterizes the orthogonal polynomial \u03c0n . This\nRH problem is due to Fokas, Its, and Kitaev [19]. We discuss it in detail in\nSection 2.\nIn Section 3 we prove Theorem 1.1. After the appropriate deformation of\ncontours, the steepest descent analysis is similar to the analysis in Deift et\nal. [11] and therefore we will not give all the details of the proof here.\nThe major part of the paper is devoted to the proof of Theorem 1.2 which\nis given in Section 4. Here the critical measure (1.9) corresponding to the\ncritical value t = \u22121/12 comes into play. For t 6= \u22121/12, we will not use\nthe equilibrium measure \u03bct from (1.6) in the steepest descent analysis, but\ninstead a modified equilibrium measure \u03bdt (in fact a signed measure). Similar\nmodified equilibrium measures were used before in [4, 5, 6] for double scaling\nlimits arising in critical random matrix models. The modified equilibrium\nproblem is discussed in Section 4.2. It leads to a modified g-function [13, 11]\nwhich is used in the first transformation of the RH problem.\nThe steepest descent analysis\n\u221a \u221athen proceeds as in [11]. We open lenses\naround the critical interval [\u2212 8, 8] and then construct a parametrix for the\n11\n\n\f\u03932\n\n\u03931\n\n\u03930\n\n\u03934\n\n\u03933\n\nFigure 3: Deformation of the contour\nresulting RH problem. The \u03a8-functions associated with Painlev\u00e9 I appear\n\u221a\nin the construction of the local parametrices around the endpoints \u00b1 8.\nThis construction is analogous to the construction in [5, 6], where a local\nparametrix was built out of the \u03a8-functions associated with Painlev\u00e9 II. The\nfinal transformation of the RH problem is given in Section 4.8. It leads to a\nRH problem which for large n can be solved explicitly in a series involving\npowers of n\u22121/5 . We calculate the terms up to order n\u22122/5 explicitly. We\nalso show how the recurrence coefficients can be expressed in terms of the\nfinal RH problem and then the final computations in Section 4.11 lead to the\nproof of Theorem 1.2.\n\n2\n\nThe Riemann-Hilbert problem\n\nBy analyticity, a deformation of the contour \u0393 does not change the polynomial \u03c0n as defined in (1.17), provided that each part \u0393j extends to infinity\nin the sector\nSj = {z \u2208 C | (4j \u2212 3)\u03c0/8 < arg(z) < (4j \u2212 1)\u03c0/8}.\n\n(2.1)\n\nFigure 3 shows a particular deformation of \u0393, which will turn out to be\nconvenient for our analysis. The contours are deformed so that they contain\nthe part [\u2212dt , dt ] on the real axis where dt is defined by (1.7). At the points\n12\n\n\f\u00b1dt the contours separate and extend to infinity in the sectors Sj . The\nprecise setting of this deformation will be given later. Changing our previous\nnotation, we will now use \u03931 , . . . , \u03934 to denote the contours as in Figure 3.\nWe also put \u03930 = [\u2212dt , dt ]. The contours are oriented as indicated in Figure\n1.\nThe parts \u03931 , . . . , \u03934 carry the weights as before, and \u03930 has the weight\n1.

The RH problem (2.3) has a solution if and only if there\nexist polynomials p and q such that\n(a) p is monic of degree n and hp(z), z k i\u03b1,\u03b2 = 0 for k = 0, 1, . . . , n \u2212 1,\n(b) q has degree \u2264 n \u2212 1, hq(z), z k i\u03b1,\u03b2 = 0 for k = 0, 1, . . . , n \u2212 2, and\nhq(z), z n\u22121 i\u03b1,\u03b2 = \u22122\u03c0i.\n13\n\n\fIn that case the solution of the RH problem is given by\nZ\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1\np(s)\u03b1(s)e\u2212N Vt (s)\nds\uf8f7\n\uf8ecp(z) 2\u03c0i \u0393\ns\u2212z\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7,\nY (z) = \uf8ed\nz \u2208 C \\ \u0393.\nZ\n\uf8f8\n\u2212N Vt (s)\nq(s)\u03b1(s)e\n1\nds\nq(z)\n2\u03c0i \u0393\ns\u2212z\n\n(2.4)\n\nProof. The proof is standard, see [19] or [9].\nNote that the non-Hermitian orthogonality is exactly the right concept\nfor the formulation of a RH problem. This has been exploited before in for\nexample [1, 24, 25].\nIt follows from Proposition 2.1 that if Y exists, then p = Y11 = \u03c0n and so\nthe monic orthogonal polynomial \u03c0n exist. The polynomial q = Y21 satisfies\nthe orthogonality conditions for \u03c0n\u22121 . If q has degree n \u2212 1, then the monic\northogonal polynomial \u03c0n\u22121 exist, and there is a constant \u03ban\u22121 6= 0 such that\nq = Y21 = \u03ban\u22121 \u03c0n\u22121 . It might happen that q has degree < n \u2212 1, and then\n\u03c0n\u22121 does not exist.\nWe use Y (n+1) , Y (n) , Y (n\u22121) to denote the solutions of the RH problem\n(2.3) for the values n + 1, n, and n \u2212 1, respectively (with fixed N). If all\nthree RH problems have a solution then \u03c0n+1 , \u03c0n and \u03c0n\u22121 exist. We show\nthat they are related by a three term recurrence relation.\nProposition 2.2. Suppose that the monic orthogonal polynomials \u03c0n+1 , \u03c0n ,\n\u03c0n\u22121 exist. Then they satisfy\n\u03c0n+1 (z) = (z \u2212 bn )\u03c0n \u2212 an \u03c0n\u22121 (z)\n\n(2.5)\n\nfor certain coefficients an and bn .\nProof. From Proposition (2.1) it follows that the RH problems for Y (n) and\nY (n+1) are solvable.\u0012From the\u0013discussion above we find that the first column\n\u03c0n\nof Y (n) consists of\nfor some non-zero constant \u03ban\u22121 .\n\u03ban\u22121 \u03c0n\u22121\nSince the jump matrices in the RH problem (2.3) have determinant one,\nand det Y (n) (z) \u2192 1 as z \u2192 \u221e, it is easy to check that det Y (n) (z) \u2261 1 for\n\u0001\u22121\nall z \u2208 C \\ \u0393. Thus Y (n) is invertible. Consider Y (n+1) Y (n) . Since Y (n)\nand Y (n+1) have the same jumps, this function has no jump on \u0393. Therefore\nits entries are entire functions. Moreover, from the asymptotic condition at\n14\n\n\finfinity it follows by Liouville's theorem that there exist constants an , bn and\ncn such that\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0001\u22121\nz \u2212 bn \u2212an /\u03ban\u22121\n(n+1)\n(n)\nY\n(z) Y (z)\n.\n(2.6)\n=\ncn\n0\nSo\n\nY\n\n(n+1)\n\n(z) =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\nz \u2212 bn \u2212an /\u03ban\u22121\nY (n) (z)\ncn\n0\n\n(2.7)\n\nand this is in fact the difference equation in the Lax pair in [19]. The 11\u2013entry\nof equation (2.7) leads to (2.5).\nThe recurrence coefficients an and bn can be expressed directly in terms\nof the solution Y (n) of the RH problem. This follows as in [9, Section 3.2].\nFor convenience of the reader, and since the precise form (2.10) for the recurrence coefficient bn is not given in [9], we include the proof of the following\nproposition as well.\nProposition 2.3.

As in the proof of Proposition 2.2 we have that Y (n) 21 is a polynomial of degree n \u2212 1 with leading coefficient \u03ban\u22121 . Thus from (2.8) we obtain\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(n)\n\u03ban\u22121 = Y1\n.\n(2.11)\n21\n\nMultiplying both sides of the identity (2.7) with z \u2212n\u03c33 and using (2.8), we\nfind\n!\n\u0013\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0012\n(n)\n(n)\nY1\nY2\nz \u2212 bn \u2212an /\u03ban\u22121\nz 0\nI+\n=\n(I + O(1/z))\n+ 2 + O(z \u22123 )\ncn\n0\n0 z \u22121\nz\nz\n15\n\n\fas z \u2192 \u221e.

In our final proposition of this section\nwe show that if we compute an and bn as in (2.9) and (2.10) and if an 6= 0,\nthen these are indeed the recurrence coefficients.\nProposition 2.4. Suppose that the RH problem (2.3) has a solution Y (n)\nwith expansion (2.8). Let an and bn be given by (2.9) and (2.10). If an 6= 0,\nthen the monic orthogonal polynomials \u03c0n+1 , \u03c0n and \u03c0n\u22121 exist and they are\nconnected by the three-term recurrence (2.5).\nProof. Since an 6= 0, we get from (2.9) that\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(n)\n\u03ban\u22121 = Y1\n6= 0.\n21\n\n(2.14)\n\nThis means that the 21-entry of Y is a polynomial of exact degree n \u2212 1 and\ntherefore the orthogonal polynomial \u03c0n\u22121 exists.\nDefine\n\u0010\n\u0011\u22121\n(n)\ncn = \u03ban\u22121 /an = (Y1 )12\n(2.15)\n\nand use (2.7) to define Y (n+1) . Then Y (n+1) is analytic in C \\ \u0393 and satisfies\nthe jump relation of the RH problem (2.3). We show that it satisfies the\nasymptotic condition with n replaced by n + 1.

Then the\nmonic orthogonal polynomial \u03c0n+1 exists and the recurrence (2.5) holds.\nIn our main results we are interested in the asymptotic behavior of an,n (t)\nand bn,n (t). As a result of Propositions 2.3 and 2.4 it suffices to take N = n\nin (2.3) and do a steepest descent analysis for this RH problem.\n\n3\n\nSteepest descent analysis in the regular case\nand the proof of Theorem 1.1\n\nIn the regular case \u22121/12 < t < 0 with t fixed, the steepest descent analysis\nfor the RH problem (2.3) with N = n can be done in a way very similar to\nthe classical steepest analysis for t \u2265 0 as in [12, 11].\n17\n\n\fIn the first transformation we use the continuation of the equilibrium measure that we discussed in Section 1 for t > 0, see (3.1). The local parametrix\nat the end-points is constructed out of Airy functions, as in the case t \u2265 0.\nTherefore the analysis will not be carried out in full detail. We only point\nout how one gets into a standard situation, by deforming the contour and\ndefining the correct equilibrium measure. Then we only sketch the rest of\nthe analysis and state the result for the recurrence coefficients.\nThe equilibrium measure\nThe first transformation is based on the equilibrium measure \u03bct defined in\n(1.6). So we have\np\nd\u03bct\nt 2\n=\n(x \u2212 d2t ) c2t \u2212 x2 ,\ndx\n2\u03c0\n\nfor x \u2208 [\u2212ct , ct ],\n\n(3.1)\n\nwith ct and dt given by (1.5) and (1.7). Since \u22121/12 < t < 0, we have that\ndt is real and 0 < ct < dt . Also note that the density (3.1) is positive for\nx \u2208 (ct , ct ). The measure \u03bct minimizes IVt (\u03bc), see (1.4), among all probability\nmeasures supported on [\u2212ct , ct ].\nLet gt : C \\ (\u2212\u221e, ct ] \u2192 C be the g-function defined by\nZ ct\nlog(z \u2212 x) d\u03bct (x),\n(3.2)\ngt (z) =\n\u2212ct\n\nwhere for each x \u2208 (\u2212ct , ct ) we choose the principal branch of the logarithm\nlog(z \u2212 x). Then gt can be represented in the following way\nZ\n1\nt z 2\n(s \u2212 d2t )(s2 \u2212 c2t )1/2 ds + Vt (z) + lt /2,\n(3.3)\ngt (z) = \u2212\n2 ct\n2\nfor all z \u2208 C\\(\u2212\u221e, ct ] and for some constant lt . Define \u03c6t : C\\(\u2212\u221e, ct ] \u2192 C\nby\nZ\nt z 2\n\u03c6t (z) = \u2212\n(s \u2212 d2t )(s2 \u2212 c2t )1/2 ds.\n(3.4)\n2 ct\n\nIn the first transformations the jumps for the transformed RH problem are\nexpressed in terms of \u03c6t .\nNote that the integrand in (3.4) is negative for s \u2208 (ct , dt ). Therefore\n\u03c6t (z) < 0,\n\nfor z \u2208 (ct , dt ).\n18\n\n(3.5)\n\n\fBy symmetry we have\n\u03c6t + (z) + \u03c6t \u2212 (z) < 0,\n\nfor z \u2208 (\u2212dt , \u2212ct ).\n\nThen it follows from (3.3), (3.5) and (3.6) that\n\u001a\nz \u2208 (\u2212ct , ct ),\ngt + (z) + gt \u2212 (z) \u2212 Vt (z) = lt ,\ngt + (z) + gt \u2212 (z) \u2212 Vt (z) < lt , z \u2208 (\u2212dt , \u2212ct ) \u222a (ct , dt ).\n\n(3.6)\n\n(3.7)\n\nThe transformation Y 7\u2192 T\nThe transformation Y 7\u2192 T normalizes the condition at infinity and serves\nas a first step to get the jumps close to the identity.

The diagonal entries of\nthe jump matrix on (\u2212ct , ct ) are therefore oscillating functions. By (3.5) and\n(3.6) the jump matrix converges pointwise to the identity for z \u2208 (\u2212dt , \u2212ct )\u222a\n(ct , dt ). We first have to specify the precise deformation of the contour to\ncontrol the behavior of the jump matrices on \u03931 , . . . , \u03934 . We will deform the\ncontour such that the jump matrix converges pointwise to the identity for\nz \u2208 \u0393 \\ [\u2212ct , ct ].\n19\n\n\f10\n\n8\n\n\u03932\n\n\u03931\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n\u03935\n\n\u2212dt\n\n0\n\ndt\n\nct\n\n\u2212ct\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22126\n\n\u03934\n\n\u03933\n\n\u22128\n\n\u221210\n\u221210\n\n\u22128\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nFigure 4: The shaded region is the region where Re \u03c6t > 0 in the regular\ncase. The curves are steepest descent curves for \u03c6t . The figure corresponds\nto the value t = \u22121/24.\nDeformation of the contour\nIn view of the jump matrix (3.10) on [\u2212ct , ct ] we want that the real part of \u03c6t\nis negative on \u0393 \\ [\u2212ct , ct ]. The shaded region in Figure 4 is the region where\nRe \u03c6t (z) > 0. In the white unshaded region we have Re \u03c6t (z) < 0. So we\nwant that each \u0393j stays in the white region. One possible way to define \u0393j is\nto take the steepest descent curve for \u03c6t through \u00b1dt in the k-th quadrant,\nwhere we have that Im \u03c6t is constant, and Re \u03c6t (z) \u2192 \u2212\u221e as z \u2192 \u221e along\nthe steepest descent curve, see Figure 4.\nSummary of the rest of the steepest descent analysis\nIn the remaining part of the steepest descent analysis we open a lens around\n[\u2212ct , ct ] to turn the oscillating jumps on [\u2212ct , ct ] into a constant jump at\n[\u2212ct , ct ] and a jump that converges pointwise to the identity on the upper\nand lower lips of the lens. In Figure 5 the contour is shown after opening of\nthe lens. This lens can be defined in a completely similar way as in the case\nt \u2265 0. After this, we construct a local solution, called parametrix, around\nthe endpoints \u00b1ct . But locally around \u00b1ct , our situation does not differ from\nthe case t \u2265 0: the equilibrium measure vanishes with an exponent 1/2 at\n20\n\n\f\u03932\n\n\u03931\n\n\u2212dt\n\n\u03930\n\u2212ct\n\nct\n\ndt\n\n\u03934\n\n\u03933\n\nFigure 5: Opening of the lenses in the regular case. The lens around [\u2212ct , ct ]\nis contained in the shaded region of Figure 4\n\u00b1ct and the contours together with the jump matrices locally have exactly\nthe same shape as in the case t \u2265 0. So the parametrix is constructed by\nmeans of Airy functions as in [11].\nProof of Theorem 1.1\nThe result of the steepest descent analysis, which we will not perform in\nmore detail here, is that the RH problem for Y (n) is solvable if n is large\nenough, so that the coefficients an,n (t) and bn,n (t) can be computed in terms\nof Y (n) as in Proposition 2.3. It also follows that the asympotic formula (1.8)\nfor the recurrence coefficient an,n (t) which holds for t \u2265 0 continues to hold\nfor \u22121/12 < t < 0. Then an,n (t) 6= 0 for n large enough, so that an,n (t)\nand bn,n (t) are indeed the recurrence coefficients by Proposition 2.4. As in\n[11] we also find a full asymptotic expansion for an,n (t) in powers of n\u22121 . In\naddition, the recurrence coefficient bn,n (t) is exponentially small.\nThis completes the proof of Theorem 1.1.\n\n21\n\n\f4\n\nSteepest descent analysis in the critical case\nand the proof of Theorem 1.2\n\nThe rest of the paper is devoted to the critical case. We take N = n in\n(2.3) and analyze the RH problem in the double scaling limit. First we let\nt be a fixed value close to \u22121/12, which could be less than \u22121/12. Later\nwe let t \u2192 \u22121/12 and n \u2192 \u221e simultaneously and show that the Painlev\u00e9 I\nequation appears.\nIn the critical case the measure \u03bccr is given by\nd\u03bccr\n(8 \u2212 x2 )3/2\n(x) =\n,\ndx\n24\u03c0\n\n(4.1)\n\n\u221a\n\u221a \u221a\nfor x \u2208 [\u2212 8, 8]. The measure vanishes with an exponent 3/2 at x = \u00b1 8.\nA consequence of this phenomenon is that the parametrix with Airy functions\nwhich we could use in the regular case fails to work in this case.\n\n4.1\n\nDeformation of the contour\n\nAs in the regular case we begin by deforming the contour \u0393. The deformed\ncontour is constructed in terms of \u03c6cr and will therefore not depend on t.\nHere \u03c6cr is\nZ z\n1\n(s2 \u2212 8)3/2 ds\n(4.2)\n\u03c6cr (z) = \u03c6\u22121/12 (z) =\n24 ccr\n\u221a\nand ccr = 8.\nThe shaded region in Figure 6 represents all z \u2208 C for which Re \u03c6cr (z) \u2265\n0. The white region represents all z \u2208 C for which Re \u03c6cr (z) < 0. As in the\nregular case, we want the \u0393j to be contained in the white\n\u221a region. Comparing\nwith Figure 4 we see that the shaded parts meet at \u00b1 8, which is a direct\n\u221a\nconsequence of the exponent 3/2 vanishing of the measure at \u00b1ccr = \u00b1 8.\nHence a major difference with the regular case is the\u221afact that the contours\nhave to leave the real axis at the point \u00b1ccr = \u00b1 8 to continue in the\ncomplex plane, whereas in the regular case we can deform the contour such\nthat it contains the interval [\u2212dt , dt ] with dt > ct .\n\u221aNow define \u0393j , j = 1, . . . , 4 as the steepest descent curve for \u03c6cr through\n\u00b1 8 in the j-th quadrant, where we have that Im \u03c6cr is constant, and\nRe \u03c6cr (z) \u2192\u221a\u2212\u221e\n\u221a as z \u2192 \u221e along the steepest descent curves.

This is inspired on the papers [5, 6], see also [4], where the authors\nused a modification of a similar equilibrium problem to handle a double\nscaling limit.\nRecall the energy functional IVt as defined in (1.4). Instead of minimizing IVt among Borel probability measures on R, we consider the following\nextremal problem. Minimize\nZZ\nZ\n1\nlog\nIVt (\u03bd) =\nd\u03bd(x) d\u03bd(y) + Vt (x) d\u03bd(x)\n(4.3)\n|x \u2212 y|\namong all signed measures \u03bd such that\nZ\n\u221a \u221a\nd\u03bd = 1,\nand\nsupp (\u03bd) \u2282 [\u2212 8, 8].\n\n(4.4)\n\nFrom general arguments of potential theory [29], there exists a unique\nminimizer \u03bdt of IVt . We will use this measure in the steepest descent analysis.\nNote that its properties differ on two crucial points from the equilibrium\n\u221a \u221a\nmeasure \u03bct as defined in (3.1). It is forced to have support within [\u2212 8, 8],\n23\n\n\fand it is not necessarily positive everywhere. Only for t = tcr = \u22121/12, we\nhave \u03bdt = \u03bct .\nThe use of this modified equilibrium measure is not without a price. If\nt > \u22121/12\n\u221a the density of the equilibrium measure is negative near the endpoints \u00b1 8, which causes a problem when we open the lens. Instead\u221aof\nexponential decay, we get exponential growth in a neighborhood of \u00b1 8.\nThis neighborhood becomes smaller when t tends to \u22121/12 and will eventually fall inside the region where we are going to make a special parametrix\nanyway. On the other hand, if t < \u22121/12 the measure \u03bdt is positive and the\nopening of the lens causes no problem,\n\u221a but we still get exponential growth in\na neighborhood of the endpoints \u00b1 8 which now follows from the behavior\nof its associated g-function on the contours \u0393j , j = 1, . . . , 4. However, when t\ntends to \u22121/12, this neighborhood will eventually fall inside the region again\nwhere we make the special parametrix.\nWe will derive an explicit expression for the minimizer.

So the jump\nmatrices in the RH problem for S would have the correct decay properties\nin case t = \u22121/12, since then \u03c6t = \u03c6cr . However, if t 6= \u22121/12, then \u03c6t is\ndifferent from \u03c6cr , and Re \u03c6t (z) has an incorrect\n\u221a sign on some of the contours.\nIn Figure 8 the contour \u03a3S is shown near 8.

Therefore, Re \u03c6t has the wrong sign on\n(small) parts of \u0393j , j = 1, 2, 3, 4 in the left picture. In the right picture it has\nthe wrong sign on (small) parts of the lips of the lens.

The jump matrices in (4.33) are exactly the same as the ones\nthat appear in the RH problem for \u03a8, see Figure 2, except that these jumps\nare on different contours. Since f provides a conformal map between the\nrespective contours, it is then immediate that \u03a8(n2/5 f (z); x, \u03b1)e\u2212n\u03c6t (z)\u03c33 has\nthe required jump properties on \u03a3S \u2229 U, for every x that is not a pole of y\u03b1 .\nSince the jumps do not depend on x, the jump properties will not be affected\nif we let x = n4/5 ut (z) where ut is analytic and n4/5 ut (z) is not a pole of\ny\u03b1 for every z \u2208 U. Finally, we note that the multiplication on the left by\nan analytic factor E(z) does not change the jumps either, so that (4.32) has\nindeed the required jump properties on \u03a3S \u2229 U.\nWhat remains to be shown is that we can find f , ut and E with the\nproperties stated in Lemma 4.3 such that the matching condition\nP (z) = M(z)(I + O(n\u22121/5 )),\n\nas n \u2192 \u221e, uniformly for z \u2208 \u2202U, (4.34)\n\nis satisfied as well.

The branches of\n\u221athe fractional exponents in (4.35)-(4.37) are all taken\nto be positive for z \u2212 8 real and positive and sufficiently small.\nLemma 4.4. Assume that x \u2208 R is not a pole of y\u03b1 and let\nt = tcr \u2212 c1 xn\u22124/5 ,\n\nc1 = 2\u22129/5 3\u22126/5 .\n\n(4.38)\n\u221a\nLet f , ut , and E be as in (4.35)-(4.37). Then there is a disk U around 8,\ndepending only on x and \u03b1 but not on n, such that the properties (2)\u2013(4)\nstated in Lemma 4.3 are satisfied and such the matching condition (4.34)\nholds.\nProof. We begin with the properties of f . It follows from this definition (4.2)\nof \u03c6cr that\n\u221a\n27/4\n(z \u2212 8)5/2 (1 + hcr (z))\n\u03c6cr (z) =\n(4.39)\n15\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwith hcr an analytic function in a neighborhood of 8 with hcr ( 8) = 0.\nThus (4.35)\n\u221a defines a conformal map \u03b6 = f (z) from a small enough disk U1\naround 8 to a neighborhood of \u03b6 = 0. Then f (z) is real for real z \u2208 U1 and\nsince by (4.39) and (4.35) we have\n\u221a\n\u221a \u0001\nf (z) = 2\u22121/10 3\u22122/5 (z \u2212 8) + O (z \u2212 8)2 ,\n(4.40)\n\u221a \u221a\n\u221a\nas z \u2192 8, we see that f maps (\u2212 8, 8) \u2229 U1 to a part of the negative\nreal axis.\nSince \u0393\u221a\n1 and \u03934 are defined as the steepest descent curves of \u03c6cr that\nstart from 8, we have that \u03c6cr is real and negative on \u03931 and \u03934 . Then it\nfollows from (4.35) that f maps these contours onto the rays arg \u03b6 = 2\u03c0/5\nand arg \u03b6 = \u22122\u03c0/5, respectively.\nFinally, to have all the mapping properties stated in (2) in Lemma 4.3,\nwe want that f maps the upper and lower lips of the lens that are inside U1\nto parts of the rays arg \u03b6 = \u00b14\u03c0/5. Here we use the additional freedom we\nhave in choosing the exact location of the lips of the lense. So far we have\nonly specified that they should be in the region\n\u221a where Re \u03c6cr > 0. Now we\nrequire in addition that in a neighborhood of 8 we want the lips\n\u221a to be such\nthat arg \u03c6cr (z) = \u00b12\u03c0 for z on the upper and lower lips near 8. We can\nclearly impose this extra requirement.\nNote that we take arg \u03c6cr\u221a(z) so that\n\u221a\nit is continuous for z \u2208 C \\ (\u2212\u221e, 8] and has the value 0 for z \u2212 8 real and\n35\n\n\fpositive. Then by (4.35) we have that arg f (z) = \u00b14\u03c0/5 for z \u2208 U1 on the\nlips of the lense, and thus all the properties stated in (2) of Lemma 4.3 are\nsatisfied.\nNow we turn to the properties of ut . Because of (4.11) and (4.36) we can\nwrite\nut (z) = (t + 1/12)u\u25e6(z)\n(4.41)\nwhere\n\u25e6\n\nu (z) = (4/5)\n\n1/5\n\nFrom (4.12) it follows that\n\n\u03c6\u25e6 (z)\n.\n(\u03c6cr (z))1/5\n\n(4.42)\n\n\u221a\n\n8)1/2 (1 + h\u25e6 (z)),\n(4.43)\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwhere h\u25e6 is analytic in a neighborhood of 8 with h\u25e6 ( 8) = 0. Then \u221a\nby\n\u25e6\n(4.39), (4.42), and (4.43) we find that u is analytic in a neighborhood of 8\nand\n\u0010\n\u221a \u0011\nu\u25e6 (z) = \u221229/5 36/5 1 + O(z \u2212 8)\n(4.44)\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u22121\n\u25e6\nfor z \u2192 8, so that\n\u221a u ( 8) = \u2212c1 . Combining (4.38), (4.41), and (4.44),\n4/5\nwe see that n \u221a\nut ( 8) = x. Since x is not a pole of y\u03b1 we can then find a\ndisk U2 around 8 with U2 \u2282 U1 , such that n4/5 ut (z) is not a pole of y\u03b1 for\nevery z \u2208 U2 . Since n4/5 ut = \u2212c1 xu\u25e6 depends only on x, the disk U2 depends\nonly on x. So the properties stated in (3) of Lemma 4.3 are satisfied.\n\u03c6\u25e6 (z) = \u221227/4 3 (z \u2212\n\nSince M is given by (4.19) we find from (4.37) that\n\u221a !\u2212\u03c33 /4\n\u0013\n\u0012\nn2/5 f (z)(z + 8)\n1 1 1\n\u221a\nE(z) = \u221a\n2 i \u2212i\nz\u2212 8\n\u221a\nwhich implies that E\nis\nanalytic\nin\na\ndisk\nU\n\u2282\nU\naround\n8, as f (z) has a\n2\n\u221a\nsimple pole at z = 8, see (4.40). This shows that property (4) of Lemma\n4.3 is satisfied.\nWe finally show that the matching condition (4.34) is satisfied. Since \u03a8\nhas asymptotics (1.21), we find from (4.32) that uniformly for z \u2208 \u2202U,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0001\n(n2/5 f (z))\u03c33 /4 1 \u2212i\n\u221a\nI + O(n\u22121/5 )\nP (z) =E(z)\n1 i\n2\n\u0001\n2/5\n\u00d7 exp (\u03b8(n f (z), n4/5 ut (z)) \u2212 n\u03c6t (z))\u03c33\n(4.45)\n36\n\n\fas n \u2192 \u221e. Since \u03b8(\u03b6, x) = 45 \u03b6 5/2 + x\u03b6 1/2 , we see that\n\u0015\n\u0014\n4\n5/2\n1/2\n2/5\n4/5\n= n\u03c6t (z)\n\u03b8(n f (z), n ut (z)) = n (f (z)) + ut (z)(f (z))\n5\n\n(4.46)\n\nwhere in the last equality we used the formulas (4.35) and (4.36) for f and\nut . Hence we can forget about the exponential factor in (4.45). Because of\nthe definition (4.37) of E we see that (4.45) leads to the matching condition\n(4.34).\nThis completes the proof of Lemma 4.4.\nRemark 4.5. The neighborhood U in Lemma 4.4 depends on x, but an\ninspection of the proof shows that that we can take U independent of x if\nx is allowed to vary in a compact set that does not contain any poles of y\u03b1 .\nThen also the matching condition (4.34) is uniformly valid for such x.\n\u221a\nParametrix around \u2212 8\n\n\u221a\nb around the other endpoint \u2212 8 should\nThe local parametrix Pb in a disk U\nsatisfy the following RH problem.\n\uf8f1\nb \\ \u03a3S\nPb(z) is analytic\u0012in U\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u0013\n\uf8f4\n2n\u03c6t (z)\n\uf8f4\n1\n(1\n\u2212\n\u03b2)e\n\uf8f4\nb\n\uf8f4\n, z \u2208 \u03932 \u2229 U,\nPb+ (z) = Pb\u2212 (z)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n0\n1\u0013\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u0012\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n1 \u03b2e2n\u03c6t (z)\n\uf8f4\nb\n\uf8f4\n,\nz \u2208 \u03933 \u2229 U,\n\uf8f2 Pb+ (z) = Pb\u2212 (z)\n0\n1\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nb,\nb\nb\n,\non the lips of the lens inside U\nP+ (z) = P\u2212 (z) \u22122n\u03c6t (z)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\ne\n1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u221a \u221a\n0 1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nb\nb\nb\n,\nz \u2208 (\u2212 8, 8) \u2229 U,\nP+ (z) = P\u2212 (z)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u22121\n0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 b\nb.\nP (z) = M(z)(I + O(n\u22121/5 )),\nas n \u2192 \u221e, uniformly for z \u2208 \u2202 U\n(4.47)\nIt turns out that Pb can be expressed directly in terms of P .
