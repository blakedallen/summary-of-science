Rochev\nInstitute for High Energy Physics, 142280, Protvino, Moscow region, Russia\n\nAbstract\nRecently proposed by Battistel et al. \"predictive formulation of the NJL model\" is discussed and its connection with the differential regularization is noted. The principal problem\nof this formulation is a non-physical singularity (Landau pole) in meson propagators. A modification of the formulation, which is free of the Landau pole and conserves main features of the\napproach, is proposed.\n\nPACS numbers: 12.39.-x, 12.38.Bx, 11.30.Rd\n\n0\n\n\fEffective models in the non-perturbative region are a considerable part of the modern stronginteraction theory. One of the most successful effective models of strong interaction of light hadrons\nis the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model with quark content. Since the NJl model in the leading\napproximation includes the quark loops and is based on non-renormalized four-fermion interaction,\nthe essential aspect of this model is a regularization, which on the widely current opinion constitutes\na part of the definition of the NJL model. Though predictions of the NJL model for commonly\nused regularizations (such as the cutoff in momentum space, the Pauli-Villars regularization or the\nproper-time regularization) are very similar (see, e.g., [2] for review), nevertheless such dependence\non the regularization prescription cannot be satisfactory from the general theoretic point of view.\nA very interesting attempt was made recently in the work of Battistel et al [1] for releasing\nthe NJL model from the regularization dependence. In this work a method for the definition of\none-loop Green functions of the NJL model was proposed (see also foregoing works [3]). The idea of\nthe method is to avoid the explicit evaluation of divergent integrals with any specific regularization.\nThe finite parts are separated of the divergent ones and are integrated without regularization. Then\nthe NJL model becomes predictive in the sense that its consequences do not depend on the specific\nregularization of divergent integrals. An important result of work [1] is a proof of the fulfilment\nof all symmetry constraints on leading-order Green functions. A parameter choice leads to the\nreasonable values of the constituent quark mass and other model parameters.\nIn the present paper some features of the calculational scheme of work [1]1 are analyzed, and\na connection of the BDK approach with the differential regularization is pointed. The principal\nproblem of the BDK approach is the singularity of meson propagators in the Euclidean momentum\nregion. The presence of this singularity (Landau pole) prevents meson-loop calculations and, therefore, makes impossible any calculations of corrections to the leading approximation. A modification\nof the scheme, which is free of Landau pole and conserves the main features of the approach of [1],\nis proposed.\nFollowing [1] we consider the simplest physically non-trivial variant of the NJL model with\nchiral symmetry SUV (2) \u00d7 SUA (2). The model Lagrangian is\ng\nL = \u03c8\u0304(i\u2202\u02c6 \u2212 m0 )\u03c8 + (\u03c8\u0304\u03c8)2 + (\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4\u03c8)2 .\n2\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(1)\n\nHere \u03c8 is the quark field with nc colours, m0 is the current quark mass, g is the coupling constant\nof m\u22122 dimension and \u03c4 are Pauli matrices.\nThe leading approximation of the model is the mean-field approximation, which coincides in the\ncase with the leading order of 1/nc \u2013expansion. All Green functions of the leading approximation\nare expressed in terms of quark one-loop integrals. A problem of calculations of these integrals is\nreduced to the definition of following five divergent integrals (see [1]):\n{I1 ; I1\u03bc } =\n\nZ\n\n{1; k\u03bc }\nd4 k\n(2\u03c0)4 (k + k1 )2 \u2212 M 2\n\n(2)\n\nd4 k\n{1; k\u03bc ; k\u03bc k\u03bd }\n(3)\n(2\u03c0)4 [(k + k1 )2 \u2212 M 2 ][(k + k2 )2 \u2212 M 2 ]\nHere M is the dynamical (constituent) quark mass, which is a non-trivial solution of the gap\nequation for the NJL model.\nA basic device for the definition of integrals (2) and (3) in the BDK approach is an algebraic identity for the propagator function (see equation (28) in work [1]). With the identity the\ndivergent parts of integrals (2) and (3) have been expressed via three tensorial and two scalar\nexternal-momentum-independent integrals which were treated in the sense of some unspecified regularization. Then integrals (2) and (3) have been expressed in terms of these five integrals and two\nstandard convergent integrals (see formulae of section III in work [1]).\n{I2 ; I2\u03bc ; I2\u03bc\u03bd } =\n\n1\n\nZ\n\nWe shall name the calculational scheme of work [1] as the BDK approach, or the implicit regularization.\n\n1\n\n\fIn connection with these expressions we draw attention to some general regularization-independent\nproperty of integrals (2) and (3). Namely, integrals {I1 ; I1\u03bc } and {I2 ; I2\u03bc ; } are connected with following relations\n\u2202I1 (k1 ; M 2 )\n= I2 (k1 , k1 ; M 2 )\n(4)\n\u2202M 2\nand\n\u2202I1\u03bc (k1 ; M 2 )\n= I2\u03bc (k1 , k1 ; M 2 ).\n(5)\n\u2202M 2\nThese relations are regularization independent and play a significant part in the approach. It is\neasy to verify the validity of these relations for traditional regularization schemes (four-dimensional\ncutoff, Pauli-Villars regularization, etc) by straightforward calculation, but their validity is not\nevident directly from above-mentioned formulae of work [1]. To prove these relations we should\ndefine derivatives of the external-momentum-independent integrals over M 2 . For this purpose we\nnote that derivatives of logarithmically-divergent integrals are convergent integrals and can be\ncalculated without any regularization. The calculations of these convergent integrals gives us zero\nvalue for derivatives of tensorial logarithmically-divergent integrals. Then it is easy to verify that\nthe derivatives of quadratically-divergent integrals are the corresponding logarithmically-divergent\nintegrals. Taking into account these circumstances it is easy to prove equations (4) and (5) for\nBDK expressions of integrals (2) and (3). The significance of relations (4) and (5) are evident since\nthey can be used for alternative definitions of quadratically divergent integrals I1 and I1\u03bc without\nadditional regularization.\nWith obtained expressions for integrals (2) and (3) the authors of work [1] have analyzed the\nsymmetry constraints on one-loop Green functions and have argued the necessity of consistency\nrelations, which are concluded in zero value for tensorial external-momentum-independent integrals\n(see eq. (86) in work [1]). With these relations all symmetry properties of the theory (such as Furry\ntheorem, Ward identities, etc) are fulfilled for all one-loop Green functions. This point is one of\nthe important results of work [1]. From the point of view of above discussion the BDK consistency\nrelations simply assert zero values of corresponding integration constants.\nThe choice of parameters of the NJL model with Lagrangian (1) in the leading approximation\nis principally defined by two divergent integrals, namely, logarithmically-divergent integral I2 and\nquadratically-divergent integral I1 . Integral I1 is a part of the gap equation\nM = m0 \u2212 8ignc M * I1 ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhich defines dynamical (constituent) quark mass M . Integral I2 determines the structure of meson\npropagators. Both these integrals can easily be defined with differential regularization without using\nthe above-mentioned algebraic identity for the propagator function.\nTo define I2 one can use well-known trick, which goes back to Gelfand and Shilov [4] (see also\n[5]). Namely, let introduce new external variables\np = k1 \u2212 k2 , P = k1 + k2 .\n\n(7)\n\nDerivatives \u2202I2 /\u2202p\u03bc \u2202I2 /\u2202P\u03bc are convergent integrals, and their calculation gives us\nip\u03bc\n\u2202I2\n=\n\u2202p\u03bc\n16\u03c0 2\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\ndu\n\nM2\n\nu(1 \u2212 u)\n,\n\u2212 u(1 \u2212 u)p2\n\n\u2202I2\n= 0.\n\u2202P\u03bc\n\n(8)\n\n\u2202f\n\u2202f\n1\nBasing on these results and using identity p2 \u2202p\n2 = 2 p\u03bc \u2202p , we naturally go to the following defini\u03bc\ntion:\nZ 1\nM 2 \u2212 u(1 \u2212 u)p2\ni\n,\n(9)\ndu\nlog\nI2 (p2 ) = \u2212\n16\u03c0 2 0\nM02\n\n2\n\n\fwhere M0 is the integration constant. This expression coincide with the BDK ones if constant M0\nis related to the scalar external-momentum-independent integral Ilog (see eq. (40) in work [1]) as\nIlog = \u2212\n\nM2\ni\nlog\n= I2 (0).\n16\u03c0 2\nM02\n\n(10)\n\nAn essential feature of the above calculation is the permutation of two limits \u2013 differentiation\nand regularization removing. Sure, such permutation is implied also in work [1] (in the calculations\nof finite parts). This permutation is an essence of Gelfand-Shilov differential regularization [4],\nwhich is based on the infinite differentiability of generalized functions.\nTo define I1 we use regularization-independent relation (4), which gives (with taking into account eq. (10))\nM02\ni\n2\n(11)\n(M\nlog\n+ M 2 \u2212 M12 ),\nI1 =\n16\u03c0 2\nM2\nwhere M12 is the integration constant of eq. (4). By taking into account the consistency relations\nsuch definitions also corresponds to BDK ones.\nTo calculate M0 and M1 and, therefore, to define I0 and I1 in full, we can use in the chiral limit\n(m0 = 0) two regularization-independent relations of NJL model (see, e.g. [2]), namely\nf\u03c02 =\n\n4nc M 2\nI2 (0)\ni\n\n(12)\n\n8nc M\nI1\ni\n\n(13)\n\nwhere f\u03c0 is the pion-decay constant, and\n\u03c7 = 2c3 =\n\nwhere \u03c7 =< 0|\u03c8\u0304\u03c8|0 > and c is the quark condensate. We have from equation (12)\nI2 (p2 ) =\n\ni h 4\u03c0 2 f\u03c02\n\u2212\n16\u03c0 2 nc M 2\n\nZ\n\n1\n\ndu log(1 \u2212 u(1 \u2212 u)\n\n0\n\np2 i\n) .\nM2\n\n(14)\n\nThen, using equations (11) and (13), we obtain for M1\nM12 = M 2 +\n\n4\u03c0 2 f\u03c02 4\u03c0 2 c3\n\u2212\n.\nnc\nnc M\n\n(15)\n\nThis equation (we shall refer it as BDK equation) plays a key role in the BDK approach.2\nAt pion constant f\u03c0 and quark condensate c being fixed equation (15) is the equation for\n2 1/3\ndynamical quark mass M , where M1 is a parameter. In terms of new variable x = \u2212 (nc /2\u03c0c ) M\nequation (15) can be written as\nx3 \u2212 3ax + 2 = 0,\n(16)\n2 2/3\n\n2 2\n\n)\nwhere a = (nc /2\u03c0\n(M12 \u2212 4\u03c0ncf\u03c0 ). Depending on the value of parameter a, three cases are possible:\n3c2\n(1) at a < 1 equation (16) possesses one real negative root x1 < 0;\n(2) at a = 1 equation (16) possesses one negative root x1 = \u22122 and one positive root x2 = 1.\n(3) at a > 1 equation (16) possesses one negative root x1 < 0 and two positive roots 0 < x2 < 1\nand x3 > 1.\nIt is clear, that at c < 0 the second case (a = 1) only can be physically accepted. The authors\nof work [1] take only this situation as a solely possible choice for model parameters. The value of\nthe dynamical quark mass, which corresponds to positive root x2 = 1 at nc = 3, is M = \u22121.873 c.\n2\n\nAn alternative way to introduce the implicit regularization can be based on an approach of work [6].\n\n3\n\n\fAt condensate value c = \u2212250 M eV it gives M = 468 M eV . Coupling constant g can be defined\nfrom the well-known relation of the NJL model\ng = \u2212M/2c3 ,\n\n(17)\n\nwhich is also regularization-independent (see, e.g., [2]). Noteworthy, the quark mass value and the\ncoupling value depend on the quark condensate value only, and do not depend on the pion constant\nvalue. The last one defines the value of M1 , which is M1 = 879 M eV at f\u03c0 = 93 M eV.\nIt is interesting to compare the parameter values of the BDK approach with the parameter\nvalues of traditional regularizations. The value of quark mass (468 MeV) in the BDK approach\nis noticeably higher in comparison with the values in the four-dimensional momentum cutoff regularization (236 MeV) and the Pauli-Villars regularization (240 MeV) (at given value of quark\ncondensate \u2013250 MeV). Apart from the quark mass dependence on the condensate value is quite\ndifferent. In the BDK approach the quark mass is proportional to the condensate, whereas in\n4-momentum cutoff and Pauli-Villars regularization the quark mass increases at decreasing the\nabsolute value of condensate. For instance, at condensate value c = \u2212210 M eV the quark mass\nis M = 393 M eV in the BDK approach and M = 423 M eV in the four-dimensional momentum\ncutoff. At the same time, from the point of view of the phenomenology the parameters' values in\nBDK approach are quite reasonable. Apart from it is necessary to recognize that expressions for\nthe Green functions are much more simple in comparison with any traditional regularization.\nIn the framework of traditional regularizations the chiral-symmetry-breaking phase always coexists with the chiral-symmetric phase, which is energetically unfavored. The existence of the\nsymmetric phase is not evident for the implicit regularization in the original formulation of work\n[1]. But the transition to the symmetric phase with M = 0 (in chiral limit m0 = 0) can be easily\nperformed with the proposed differential formulation of the implicit regularization. Really, taking\nip\np2\n\u2202I2\n= \u2212 16\u03c02\u03bcp2 and, therefore, I2 (p2 ) = \u2212 8\u03c0i 2 log M\nM = 0 in equation (8), we obtain \u2202p\n2 instead of\n\u03bc\n0\n\niM 2\n\n(9). Then I1 = \u2212 16\u03c012 at M \u2192 0 and from equations (12) and (13) it follows that f\u03c0 \u2192 0 and\nc \u2192 0 in correspondence with the trivial physics of the symmetric phase.\nAn essential difference from other regularizations manifests the properties of Green functions\nin the Euclidean momentum region. In the BDK approach the meson propagators possess a nonphysical singularity \u2013 a pole at the negative momentum square (Landau pole, or Landau ghost).3\nThe meson propagators in the NJL model are scalar and pseudoscalar parts of the two-particle\namplitude and can be written as\nD\u03c3 = \u2212\n\nig\nm0 /M \u2212 4ignc (4M 2 \u2212 p2 )I2 (p2 )\n\n(18)\n\nig\n.\nm0 /M + 4ignc p2 I2 (p2 )\n\n(19)\n\nfor the sigma-meson and\nD\u03c0 = \u2212\n\nfor the pion. In the chiral limit the equation for the Landau pole, as it follows from equation (14),\nis\n!2\nz+1\n1 2\u03c0f\u03c0\nz log\n=2+\n,\n(20)\nz\u22121\nnc\nM\nq\n\n2\n\n. At above values of the model parameters (nc = 3, f\u03c0 = 93 M eV, M =\nwhere z = 1 \u2212 4M\np2\n468 M eV ) this equation has solution p2L = \u22124.29M 2 = \u2212(969 M eV )2 , i.e., Landau mass value\n3\nThe existence of such pole was discovered firstly in quantum electrodynamics [7] and presents a characteristic\nfeature of theories without an asymptotic freedom in deep-Euclidean region. The existence of the Landau ghost in a\nsystem of fermions coupled to a chiral field has been observed in work [8]\n\n4\n\n\fML2 = \u2212p2L approximately twice larger in comparison with the quark mass: ML = 2.07M . Beyond\nthe chiral limit (at m0 6= 0) this value changes very small (about 1%) due to the smallness of\ncurrent quark mass m0 .\nThe existence of the Landau pole is a serious problem of the BDK approach. In particular, any\ncalculations with meson loops become problematic. Though such calculations exceed the framework of the one-loop approximation, which is a subject of work [1], the impracticability of these\ncalculations means a principal impossibility of calculations of corrections to leading approximation\nand cannot be acceptable.\nFurther, the Landau pole in quantum electrodynamics due to the smallness of fine structure\nconstant \u03b1 is located in the very distant asymptotic Euclidean region ((ML2 )QED \u2243 \u2212m2e exp{ 3\u03c0\n\u03b1 },\nwhere me is the electron mass and \u03b1 \u2243 1/137), and its presence can be in principle ignored. Really,\nat the much smaller energies the quantum electrodynamics becomes a part of an asymptotically\nfree grand unification theory with self-consistent asymptotic behavior. In the NJL model with\nthe implicit regularization the Landau pole is located near the physical region of the model, and\nsimilar reasoning is impossible in principle. From the other hand, the traditional regularizations,\nsuch as the four-dimensional cutoff or the Pauli-Villars regularization, are free on this problem \u2013\nthe meson propagators in these regularizations do not have the Landau poles. Therefore, implicit\nregularization, possessing the certain appeal and simplicity, contains serious defect as the nearby\nLandau pole.\nTo improve the situation a compromise approach is necessary, which conserves main features\nof implicit regularization and at the same time solves the problem of the Landau pole. Such\ncompromise can be achieved with the Feynman regularization for logarithmically divergent integral\nI2 :\nZ\no\n1\n1\nd4 q n\n2\n\u2212\n,\n(21)\nI2 (p ) =\n(2\u03c0)4 (M 2 \u2212 (p + q)2 )(M 2 \u2212 q 2 ) (Mr2 \u2212 (p + q)2 )(Mr2 \u2212 q 2 )\n\nwhere Mr is a regulator mass (Mr2 > M 2 ), and the definition of quadratically divergent integral I1\nas before is made by relation (4).\nIn Euclidean region p2 < 0 integral (21) can be represented as\nI2 =\nwhere\nF (x) =\n\nZ\n\np2\ni\nF\n(\u2212\n),\n16\u03c0 2\nM2\n\n1\n\ndu log\n0\n\nMr2 /M 2 + u(1 \u2212 u)x\n.\n1 + u(1 \u2212 u)x\n\n(22)\n\nProve the absence of zeroes of this function\nat x > 0. Evaluating\nelementary integrals in equation\nq\nq\n4Mr2\n4\n1\n1\n(22) and introducing variables v = 2 ( 1 + x \u22121) and vr = 2 ( 1 + xM\n2 \u22121) we obtain the following\nexpression:\nh\n1\n1 i\n1 + vr\n+ vr log(1 + ) \u2212 v log(1 + ) .\n(23)\nF = 2 log\n1+v\nvr\nv\n\n1\nr\nIf Mr2 > M 2 , then vr > v, and from elementary inequalities log 1+v\n1+v > 0 and vr log(1 + vr ) >\nv log(1 + v1 ) it follows that F > 0 in the Euclidean region, i.e. the meson propagators do not\npossess the Landau pole with this definition. For other aspects this modified regularization is\nsimilar to implicit regularization. For the modified regularization\n\nI2 (0) = \u2212\n\ni\nM2\n,\nlog\n16\u03c0 2\nMr2\n\nand, consequently, I1 is defined by same formula (11) with substitution\nM0 \u2192 Mr ,\n5\n\n(24)\n\n\fi.e. integration constant M0 everywhere is substituted by regulator mass Mr . Such re-definition\nof I1 still implies an existence of additional parameter M12 , which is the integration constant of\nequation (4).\nEquation (15), which determines quark mass M , has exactly the same form for this modified\nregularization, and, consequently, all parameter values are the same. Remark, condition Mr2 > M 2\nis the automatical consequence of formula (12). Therefore, the proposed modification conserves\nmain features of the implicit regularization and simultaneously solves the problem of Landau pole.4\nA general receipt for definitions of divergent integrals (2) and (3) can be formulated as follows:\nintegrals (3) are defined by formulae\n{I2 ; I2\u03bc ; I2\u03bc\u03bd } = {I2 ; I2\u03bc ; I2\u03bc\u03bd }BDK (M 2 ) \u2212 {I2 ; I2\u03bc ; I2\u03bc\u03bd }BDK (Mr2 ).\n\n(25)\n\nUpper index BDK means that each integral with mass M or Mr is defined by formulae of work\n[1].5\nThen integrals (2) are defined by equations (4) and (5). A consistency relation is the coincidence\nof integration constants, and, therefore,\nI1\u03bc = \u2212k1\u03bc I1\n\n(26)\n\nas in the BDK approach with consistency conditions.\nIt should be noted, that due to linearity of consistency constraints considered in work [1], the\nanalysis of symmetry conservation, which was made in this work, can be carried to the proposed\nmodification.\nA principal distinction between the implicit regularization and the proposed ghostless modification consists in the treating of integral I2 . Parameter M0 in the implicit regularization is the\nintegration constant whereas parameter Mr in the Feynman regularization (21) is introduced \"by\nhands\" and seems to be an outside object. The question arises, if really this object is some \"secret\nparameter\", which ensures the self-consistency of the NJL model on the quantum level? We cannot\nanswer to this question now with the full confidence, but the structure of the implicit regularization\ngives us an allusion to the possible realization of this idea. The term with regulator mass Mr in the\ndefinition of integral I2 by formula (21) can be interpreted as the rise of some repulsive interaction\n(i.e. interaction with a negative coupling) at the one-loop level. The coupling constant of the NJL\nmodel is connected with the quark mass and the condensate by formula (17). If the quark condensate is negative the negative coupling corresponds to the negative quark mass. In this connection\nit is not out of place to recall about the negative solution of BDK equation (15) (\"quark ghost\").\nIn the physical case this solution is \u22122M , where M is the dynamical quark mass. The existence\nof this solution can be an indication of such repulsive interaction, which becomes apparent on the\none-loop quantum level. At given above parameter values we have |Mr | \u2243 1.3M . This value, of\ncourse, is far from the expected value. When the absolute value of the quark condensate decreases\nratio |Mr |/M arises, and at c = \u2212210 M eV it equals to \u2243 1.5. At c = \u2212150 M eV it reaches\nexpected value 2, but the last value of the condensate is phenomenologically unacceptable since it\nleads to the very large value of the current quark mass m0 = 21 M eV . Therefore, the question\nof the possible \"inter-termination of ghosts\" in the framework of the NJL model remains to be\nopen.\n4\n\nAnother way to remove the Landau ghost in the NJL model is the method of work [9], based on the Kallen\u2013\nLehmann representation. This method has been applied in work [10] to the chiral \u03c3-model. However, the proposed\nreceipt seems to be preferable in the framework of the implicit regularization since this regularization has deal with\na set of integrals while the method of works [9, 10] should be applied to the proper two-point functions.\n5\nWith such definitions integrals I2 and I2\u03bc are convergent without additional regularization. Since for selfconsistency of the receipt it is necessary to verify the coincidence of usual calculation of these integrals with the\ncalculation by formula (25), based on the BDK definition of divergent integrals. Simple calculation demonstrates the\nreality of such coincidence.\n\n6\n\n\fIn conclusion, discuss briefly the definition of model parameters beyond the chiral limit. At\nm0 6= 0 from eq.(19) it follows the pion spectrum equation\nm0 =\n\n2inc M 2\n* m2\u03c0 * I2 (m2\u03c0 ).\nc3\n\n(27)\n\nPractically this equation is used for definition of current quark mass m0 .\nTaking approximation I2 (m2\u03c0 ) \u2243 I2 (0), we obtain the well-known current-algebraic Gell-MannOakes-Renner formula\nm2\u03c0 f\u03c02 \u2243 \u2212m0 < \u03c8\u0304\u03c8 > .\n(28)\nThis relation, of course, is regularization-independent (and what is more, model-independent). At\nm\u03c0 = 135 M eV, c = \u2212250 M eV we obtain from eq.(28) m0 = 5.2 M eV . The exploiting of\nregularization-dependent exact value I0 (m2\u03c0 ) changes this result very slightly (approximately of 1\npercent) due to the smallness of pion mass, and such specification, of course, lays out the framework\nof the model, it being right as for the implicit regularization as the modified variant.\nThe sigma-meson mass in the chiral limit is 2M . Beyond the chiral limit the equation on the\nsigma-meson mass follows from equation (18):\nm0 =\n\n2inc M 2\n* (m2\u03c3 \u2212 4M 2 ) * I2 (m2\u03c3 ).\nc3\n\n(29)\n\nWith rather crude approximation I2 (m2\u03c3 ) \u2243 I2 (0) and with taking into account equation (28) we\nobtain the well-known regularization-independent formula (see, e.g., [2])\nm2\u03c3 \u2243 4M 2 + m2\u03c0 .\n\n(30)\n\nThe much more exact (but regularization-dependent) approximation is I2 (m2\u03c3 ) \u2243 I2 (4M 2 ). In this\ncase, we obtain\nm2\u03c3 \u2243 4M 2 + 0.21m2\u03c0\n(31)\nfor the implicit regularization, and\nm2\u03c3 \u2243 4M 2 + 0.26m2\u03c0\n\n(32)\n\nfor the modified variant.\nAs we see from the above formulae, in the physical region of energies about 1 GeV the quantitative difference of these regularizations is not very significant.\n\nAcknowledgments\nAuthor is grateful to R Jafarov and V A Petrov for useful discussions.\n\nReferences\n[1] Battistel O A, Dallabona G and Krein G 2008 Phys.Rev.
