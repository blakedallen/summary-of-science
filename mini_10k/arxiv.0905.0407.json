We review Koszul duality in representation theory of category O,\nespecially we give a new presentation of the Koszul duality functor. Combining\nthis with work of Backelin, we show that the translation and Zuckerman functors are Koszul dual to each other, thus verifying a conjecture of Bernstein,\nFrenkel and Khovanov. Finally we use Koszul duality to give a short proof of\nthe Enright-Shelton equivalence.\n\n1. Introduction.\nThe definite exposition of Koszul duality in representation theory is the paper of\nBeilinson, Ginzburg and Soergel [5]. The main theme of that paper is that the\ncategory O of Bernstein, Gelfand and Gelfand is the module category of a Koszul\nring, from which many properties of O can be deduced very elegantly. They also\nconsider singular as well as parabolic versions of O and show that they are are\nequivalent to each other under the Koszul duality functor. Two of the main tools\nto obtain these results were the Zuckerman functors and the translation functors.\nIn a recent paper by Bernstein, Frenkel and Khovanov [6] these functors are\nstudied on certain simultaneously singular and parabolic subcategories of O, in\ntype A. They show, partially conjecture, that each one of them \u2013 in combination\nwith an equivalence of certain categories due to Enright-Shelton \u2013 can be used to\ncategorify the Temperley-Lieb algebra and also conjecture that these two pictures\nshould be Koszul dual to each other.\nThe purpose of this note is to show that the translation\u2013 and Zuckerman functors are indeed Koszul dual to each other. By this we mean that both admit\ngraded versions and that these correspond under the Koszul duality functor. Although this of course is one of the main philosophical points of [5], a rigorous\nproof was never given.\nWe furthermore use the Koszul duality theory to give a simple proof of the\nEnright-Shelton equivalence.\nIt is a pleasure to thank Wolfgang Soergel for many useful discussions. Most of\nthis work was done while I was a research assistant at the University of Freiburg,\nGermany.\n1\n\nSupported by EPSRC grant M22536 and by the TMR-network algebraic Lie Theory ERBFMRX-CT97-0100.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nSTEEN RYOM-HANSEN\n\nAdded: Recently C. Stroppel [11] has obtained a proof of the full BernsteinFrenkel-Khovanov conjectures, in part using results from the present paper.\n2. Preliminaries\nIn this section we will mostly recall some of the basic definitions and concepts\nfrom the theory of Koszul duality, see also [5].\nLet g be a complex semisimple Lie algebra containing a Borel algebra b with\nCartan part h and let O be the category of g-modules associated to it by Bernstein, Gelfand and Gelfand. For \u03bb \u2208 h\u2217 integral but possibly singular, denote by\nO\u03bb the subcategory of O consisting of modules of generalized central character \u03c7\u03bb\n\u2013 we refer to it as the singular category O. Let S be the set of simple reflections\ncorresponding to our data, and let S\u03bb be the subset consisting of those reflections\nthat fix \u03bb under the dot operation. Then S\u03bb defines a parabolic subalgebra q(\u03bb).\nWe define the parabolic category O\u03bb to consist of the q(\u03bb)-finite objects in O. For\n\u03bb = 0 we omit the index, i.e. we write O0 = O, this should not cause confusion.\nLet P denote the sum of all indecomposable projectives in O, hence P is a\nprojective generator of O. Analogously, we can construct projective generators\nP\u03bb (resp. P \u03bb ) of O\u03bb (resp. O\u03bb ). Let A = EndO P (resp. A\u03bb = EndO\u03bb P\u03bb , A\u03bb =\nEndO\u03bb P \u03bb ). By general principles, we can then identify O with Mod\u2212A, the\ncategory of finitely generated A-right modules (and analogously for A\u03bb , A\u03bb ).\nLet T0\u03bb : O \u2192 O\u03bb , T\u03bb0 : O\u03bb \u2192 O be the Jantzen translation functors onto\nand out of the wall. Passing to Mod\u2212A, T0\u03bb corresponds to the functor\nMod\u2212A \u2192 Mod\u2212A\u03bb : M 7\u2192 M \u2297A X\nwhere X is the (A, A\u03bb ) bimodule X = HomO ( P\u03bb , T0\u03bb P ). There is a similar\ndescription of T\u03bb0 : O\u03bb \u2192 O.\nLet \u03c4\u03bb : O \u2192 O\u03bb be the parabolic truncation functor, by definition it takes\nM \u2208 O to its largest q(\u03bb)-finite quotient. It is right exact and left adjoint to the\ninclusion functor \u03b9\u03bb : O\u03bb \u2192 O, which is exact, and it thus takes projectives to\nprojectives. It even takes indecomposable projectives to indecomposable projectives. Its top degree left derived functor is the Zuckerman functor that takes a\nmodule M \u2208 O to its largest q(\u03bb)-finite submodule.\nOn the Mod\u2212A level, \u03c4\u03bb is given by the tensor product with the (A, A\u03bb )bimodule Y = HomO\u03bb ( P \u03bb, \u03c4\u03bb P ). However, from the above considerations we\ndeduce that Y = A\u03bb , the left A-structure coming from \u03c4\u03bb and the right A\u03bb structure coming from the multiplication in A\u03bb .\nLet us finally recall the definition of a Koszul ring.\nL\nDefinition 1.L\nLet R = i\u22650 Ri be a positively graded ring with R0 semisimple\nand put R+ = i>0 Ri . R is called Koszul if the right module R0 \u223c\n= R/R+ admits\n\n\fKOSZUL DUALITY OF TRANSLATION-AND ZUCKERMAN FUNCTORS\n\n3\n\na graded projective resolution P \u2022 \u0589 R0 such that P i is generated by its component\nPii in degree i. The Koszul dual ring of R is defined as R! := Ext\u2022R (R0 , R0 ).\nThe main point of [5] is now that all the rings appearing above can be given a\nKoszul grading.\n3. Koszul duality.\nThe main purpose of this section is to give a new construction of the Koszul\nduality functor.\nKoszul duality is an equivalence at the level of derived categories between the\ngraded module categories of a Koszul ring and its dual. It exists under some\nmild finiteness conditions. The concept appeared for the first time in the paper\n[3] where it is shown that for any finite dimensional vector space V the derived\ngraded module categories of the symmetric algebra SV and the exterior algebra\nV\nV \u2217 are equivalent. The argument used there carries over to general Koszul\nrings and is the one used in [5].\nWe shall here present another approach to the Koszul duality functor, using\nthe language of differential graded algebras (DG-algebras). Although also the\npapers [4] and [9] link DG-algebras with Koszul duality, we were rather inspired\nby the construction of the localization functor in the book of Bernstein and Lunts\n[7].\nLet us start out by repeating the basic definitions.\nDefinition\n2. A DG-algebra A = (A, d) is a graded associative algebra A =\nL\u221e\ni\n0\ni=\u2212\u221e A with a unit 1A \u2208 A and an additive endomorphism d of degree 1, s.t.\nd2 = 0\n\nd(a * b) = da * b + (\u22121)deg(a) a * db\nand d(1A ) = 0.\nDefinition 3. A left module M = (M,\na DG-algebra A = (A, d) is a\nL dM ) over\ni\nM\nwith\nan additive endomorphism\ngraded unitary right A-module M = \u221e\ni=\u2212\u221e\n2\ndM : M \u2192 M of degree 1, s.t. dM = 0 and\ndM (am) = da * m + (\u22121)deg(a) a * dM m\nDefinition 4. A right module M = L\n(M, dM ) over a DG-algebra A = (A, d) is a\ni\ngraded unitary right A-module M = \u221e\ni=\u2212\u221e M with an additive endomorphism\n2\ndM : M \u2192 M of degree 1, s.t. dM = 0 and\ndM (ma) = dM m * a + (\u22121)deg(m) m * da\n\n\f4\n\nSTEEN RYOM-HANSEN\n\nUnless otherwise stated, A will from now on be the ring EndO (P ) from the\nformer section.\nBy the selfduality theorem of Soergel [10] we know that A = Ext\u2022O (L, L), where\nL is the sum of all simples in O. This provides A with a grading which by [10]\nor [5] is a Koszul grading.\nWe regard A as a DG-algebra A with A = A0 . At this stage we neglect the\ngrading on A, hence A just has one grading, the DG-algebra grading.\nLet K \u2022 be the Koszul complex of A, see e.g. [5]. It is a projective resolution\nof k (which corresponds to the sum of all simples in O). In [5] K \u2022 is a resolution\nof left A-modules of k; we however prefer to modify it to a resolution of right\nA-modules. Furthermore we change the sign of the indices so that the differential\nhas degree +1.\nLet kw denote the simple A-module corresponding to Lw \u2208 O and let Kw\u2022 be a\nprojective resolution of kw . The Koszul complex K \u2022 is then quasiisomorphic to\nL\n\u2022\n\u03bb Kw .\n\nWe can consider K \u2022 as a DG right module of the DG-algebra A, and as such\nit is K-projective in the sense of [7]: the homotopy category of DG-modules\nof A is simply the homotopy category of complexes of A-modules, hence any\nquasiisomorphism from K \u2022 to an DG-module M is a homotopy isomorphism.\nGiven two DG-modules M, N of the (arbitrary) DG-algebra A, recall the\nconstruction of the complex Hom \u2022A (M, N):\nHom nA (M, N) := HomA (M, N[n])\ndf := dN f \u2212 (\u22121)n f dM , f \u2208 Hom nA (M, N).\nIf we perform this construction on K \u2022 , we obtain a DG-algebra\nEnd \u2022A (K \u2022 ) = Hom \u2022A (K \u2022 , K \u2022 ),\nthe multiplication being given by composition of maps (notice that this construction does not involve the Koszul grading on A).\nThe signs match up to give K \u2022 the structure of an End \u2022A (K \u2022 ) left DG-module.\nLet for any DG-algebra A, D b Mod \u2212A) denote the bounded derived category\nof right A-modules, see for example Bernstein-Lunts [7] for an exposition of this\ntheory.\nLet D b (Mof \u2212A) denote the bounded derived category of finitely generated Amodules, and let D b (Mof \u2212A) be the corresponding category of A-modules. Let\nD b (Mof \u2212 End \u2022A (K \u2022 )) be the subcategory of D b (Mod \u2212 End \u2022A (K \u2022 )) consisting of\nfinitely generated End \u2022A (K \u2022 )-modules in the algebra sense. Then we have\nLemma 1. D b (Mof \u2212 End \u2022A (K \u2022 )) is generated, in the sense of triangulated categories, by the Hom \u2022A (K \u2022 , Kw\u2022 )'s.\n\n\fKOSZUL DUALITY OF TRANSLATION-AND ZUCKERMAN FUNCTORS\n\n5\n\nProof. Since our ring A is Koszul, the DG-algebras End \u2022A (K \u2022 ) and (Ext \u2022A (k, k), d =\n0) are quasiisomorphic [5, Theorem 2.10.1] and hence their bounded derived categories are equivalent. Under this equivalence the End \u2022A (K \u2022 )-module Hom \u2022A (K \u2022 , Kw\u2022 )\nbecomes the (Ext \u2022A (k, k) , d = 0)-module (Ext \u2022A (k, kw ) , d = 0).\nNow a certain polynomial DG-algebra B with d = 0 is studied in chapter 11 of\n[7]. Corollary 11.1.5 there is the statement that D b (Mof \u2212B) is generated by B\nitself. The proof of this Corollary 11.1.5 relies on the differential being zero for\nB and of the fact that finitely generated projective modules over a polynomial\nalgebra are free. We do not have this last property in our situation and should\ntherefore adjust the statement of the Lemma accordingly. Let us give a few\ndetails on the modifications:\nLet thus (M, dM ) be an object of D b (Mof \u2212(Ext \u2022A (k, k), d = 0)). Then we have\na triangle in that category of the form\nKer dM \u2192 M \u2192 M/ Ker dM \u2192\nBut the first and the third terms have zero differential so we may assume that\ndM = 0.\nLet now\n\n\u01eb\n\n0 \u2192 P \u2212n \u2192 P \u2212n+1 \u2192 . . . \u2192 M \u2192 0\nbe a projective graded resolution of M considered as Ext \u2022A (k, k)-module. Defining\ni\nP \u2208 D b (Mof \u2212(Ext \u2022A (k, k), d = 0)) as having k'th DG-part \u2295i Pk\u2212i\nand differential\nM\ninduced\nby\n\u01eb.\nfrom the resolution, we get a quasiisomorphism P \u223c\n=\nOn the other hand the finitely generated, graded projectives over Ext \u2022A (k, k)\nare the direct sums of the Ext \u2022A (k, kw )'s and we are done.\n\u0003\nNow since K \u2022 is K-projective, it can be used in itself to calculate\nRHom A (K \u2022 , M) for an A-module M. But K \u2022 is an End \u2022A (K \u2022 )- module, so we\nget a functor:\nRHom A (K \u2022 , \u2212) : D b (Mod \u2212A) \u2192 D b (Mod \u2212 End \u2022A (K \u2022 ))\nThis might require a little consideration: one should check that\nRHom A (K \u2022 , \u2212) takes homotopies to homotopies, even when considered as a functor to the category of right End \u2022A (K \u2022 )-modules, and likewise for quasiisomorphisms. For homotopies, one checks this by hand (after having consulted e.g.\nBernstein-Lunts [7] for the definition of the homotopy category of DG-modules).\nFor quasiisomorphisms one uses the standard argument: if f : M \u2192 N is a\nquasiisomorphism, then Hom \u2022A (K \u2022 , C(f )) is acyclic (C(f ) denoting the cone of\nf ) and so on: the action of End \u2022A (K \u2022 ) is irrelevant for this argument.\nNow we also have a functor in the other direction:\nL\n\n\u2212 \u2297End \u2022A (K \u2022 ) K \u2022 : D b (Mod \u2212A) \u2190 D b (Mod \u2212 End \u2022A (K \u2022 ))\n\n\f6\n\nSTEEN RYOM-HANSEN\n\nRecall that this construction involves the replacement of\nN \u2208 D b (Mod \u2212 End \u2022A (K \u2022 ))\nby a K-flat object (actually a K-projective object will do), to which it is quasiL\n\nisomorphic. The action of A on K \u2022 then provides N \u2297End \u2022A (K \u2022 ) K \u2022 with the\nstructure of DG-module over A:\nd(n \u2297 ka) = d(n) \u2297 ka + (\u22121)deg(n) n \u2297 d(ka)\n= d(n) \u2297 ka + (\u22121)deg(n) n \u2297 d(k)a\n= d(n \u2297 k)a\nsince the differential of A is zero. Once again, one should here check that the\nfunctor makes sense as a functor into the category of A-modules.\nWe can then prove the following Theorem:\nTheorem 5. The functor RHom A (K \u2022 , \u2212) establishes an equivalence of the triangulated categories D b (Mof \u2212A) and D b (Mof \u2212 End \u2022A (K \u2022 )). The inverse functor\nL\n\nis \u2212 \u2297End \u2022A (K \u2022 ) K \u2022 .\nProof. Note first that D b (Mof \u2212A) is generated by the Kw\u2022 , since they are resolutions of the simple A-modules and short exact sequences O-modules induce\ntriangles in D b (Mod \u2212A).\nBut then RHom A (K \u2022 , M) belongs to D b (Mof \u2212 End \u2022A (K \u2022 )) for M \u2208 D b (Mof \u2212 End \u2022A (K \u2022 )),\nsince it clearly does so for each of the generators Kw\u2022 .\nWe furthermore see that RHom A (K \u2022 , M) is a K-projective End \u2022A (K \u2022 )-module\nfor any M in D b(Mof \u2212A) since it clearly holds for Kw\u2022 and the K-projectives\nform a triangulated subcategory of K(Mod \u2212 End \u2022A (K \u2022 )), the homotopy category\nof End \u2022A (K \u2022 )-modules.\nWe then obtain a morphism \u03c8M in D b (Mod \u2212 A) in the following way.\nL\n\n\u03c8M : RHom A (K \u2022 , M) \u2297End \u2022A (K \u2022 ) K \u2022 \u2192 M : f \u2297 k 7\u2192 f (k)\nOne checks that \u03c8M defines a natural transformation from the functor\nL\n\nRHom A (K \u2022 , \u2212) \u2297End \u2022A (K \u2022 ) K \u2022\nto the identity functor Id. It is a quasiisomorphism for M = Kw\u2022 , and thus for\nall M.\nOn the other hand we have for a K-projective End \u2022A (K \u2022 )-module N the canonical morphism \u03c6N given as follows:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nL\n\u03c6N : N \u2192 RHom A K \u2022 , N \u2297End \u2022A (K \u2022 ) K \u2022\nni \u2208 N i 7\u2192 ( kj \u2208 K j 7\u2192 ni \u2297 kj )\n\n\fKOSZUL DUALITY OF TRANSLATION-AND ZUCKERMAN FUNCTORS\n\n7\n\nOne readily sees that \u03c6N is a quasiisomorphism for N = Hom \u2022A (K \u2022 , Kw\u2022 ). But\nthese objects generate D b (Mof \u2212 End \u2022A (K \u2022 )) and we can argue as above.\nLet us finally comment on the shifts [1]. It should here be noticed that since\nwe are working with right DG-modules, the appropriate definition of M[1] for a\nDG-module M over a DG-algebra A is the following:\n(M[1])i = M i+1 , dM [1] = \u2212dM and m \u25e6 a = ma\nwhere m \u25e6 a is the multiplication in M[1] while ma is the multiplication in M.\nSo unlike the left module situation, the A structure on M is here left unchanged.\nOne now checks that the functors commute with the shifts [1].\n\u0003\nNow A has a Koszul grading so we may consider the category mof \u2212A of\nfinitely generated, graded A-modules. Let us use a lower index to denote the\ngraded parts with respect to this Z-grading. This passes to the derived category\nof graded DG-modules which we denote by D b (mof \u2212 A). It may be identified\nwith the derived category of mof \u2212A and carries a twist h1i which we arrange\nthe following way:\nMh1ii = Mi\u22121\n\u2022\nNow the grading on K induces a grading on End \u2022A (K \u2022 ) as well; it satisfies the\nrule\nEnd \u2022A (K \u2022 )i := end \u2022A (K \u2022 , K \u2022 h\u2212ii)\nWith this grading on End \u2022A (K \u2022 ), we may consider its graded module category,\nwhich we denote D b (mof \u2212 End \u2022A (K \u2022 )). Let us moreover denote the subcategory of this generated, with twists, by the graded summands of the DG-module\nEnd \u2022A (K \u2022 ) itself by\nD b(hEnd \u2022A (K \u2022 )i)\n(It would have been more consistent with the earlier notation to write D b (mof \u2212\nEnd \u2022A (K \u2022 )) for this category; we however prefer the above notation in order to\nsave space).\nIt is now straightforward to prove the following strengthening of the former\ntheorem:\nTheorem 6. The functor RHom A (K \u2022 , \u2212) establishes an equivalence of the triangulated categories D b (mof \u2212 A) and D b (hEnd \u2022A (K \u2022 )i). It commutes with the\ntwists [1] and h1i.\nOur next task will be to study the DG-algebra (Ext \u2022A (K \u2022 ), d = 0). More precisely, we are going to compare D b (hExt \u2022A (K \u2022 ), d = 0i) with the standard derived\ncategory of the category of finitely generated, graded modules over\n\n\f8\n\nSTEEN RYOM-HANSEN\n\nExt \u2022A (k, k), i.e. D b (mof \u2212 Ext \u2022A (k, k)). Here, we define the Z-grading on\n(Ext \u2022A (K \u2022 ), d = 0) to be the negative of the DG-grading.\nAn object of D b (mof \u2212 Ext \u2022A (k, k)) is a bounded complex\n0 \u2192 P \u2212n \u2192 P \u2212n+1 \u2192 . . . \u2192 P0 \u2192 . . . \u2192 P m\u22121 \u2192 P m \u2192 0\nof projective graded Ext \u2022A (k, k)-modules (so the differential has degree 0). Using\nthis, one constructs a DG-module P of the DG-algebra (Ext \u2022A (k, k), d = 0) in the\nfollowing way:\n0 \u2192 P \u2212n h\u2212ni \u2192 P \u2212n+1 h\u2212n + 1i \u2192 . . . \u2192 P 0 h0i \u2192 * * * P m hmi \u2192 0.\nL n\nIn\nother\nwords,\nP\nis\nthe\nmodule\nP\n=\nwhose k'th DG-piece\nPk =\nnP\nL i\nL is\ni\ni Pk\u2212i . We make P into a graded DG-module by the rule Pj =\ni P\u2212j . This\nconstruction defines a functor\nF : D b (mof \u2212 Ext \u2022A (k, k)) \u2192 D b (mod \u2212(Ext \u2022A (k, k), d = 0))\nsince a graded homotopy between two morphisms f, g : P \u2022 \u2192 Q\u2022 of modules will\nbe mapped to a homotopy in the DG-category.\nI will now argue that actually F is a functor into the category\nD (hExt \u2022A (k, k), d = 0i). To see this note first that the Pi hii all lie in this category\nsince they are summands of (shifts of) (Ext \u2022A (k, k), d = 0). On the other hand\nF can be viewed as an iterated graded mapping cone construction in the DGsense, starting with the morphism P m\u22121 hmi \u2192 P m hmi, which is already a DGmorphism, and the claim follows. The graded mapping cone of a graded DGu\nmodule morphism M \u2192 N is given by C(u) = N \u2295 M[1] as DG-module, and\nreversing the degrees with respect to the Z-grading.\nb\n\nIt is now clear that F commutes with the twists [1]. On the other hand F\ntakes a sequence of Ext \u2022A (k, k)-modules isomorphic to a standard triangle\nu\n\nM \u2192 N \u2192 C(u) \u2192 M[1]\nto a sequence of graded DG-modules isomorphic to\nF (u)\n\nF (M) \u2192 F (N) \u2192 F (C(u)) \u2192 F (M[1]).\nBut this is easily seen to be a standard triangle of DG-modules; in other words\nF is a triangulated functor.\nOne furthermore checks that F is full and faithful and it is thus an equivalence\nof triangulated categories once we have shown that the generators (Ext \u2022A (k, kw ), d =\n0) lie in the image of F . But this is clear.\nSince\nM1 \u2192 M2 \u2192 M3 \u2192\nis a triangle if and only if\nF (M1 ) \u2192 F (M2 ) \u2192 F (M3 ) \u2192\n\n\fKOSZUL DUALITY OF TRANSLATION-AND ZUCKERMAN FUNCTORS\n\n9\n\nis a triangle we deduce that the inverse functor G is triangulated as well.\nOur next task will be to analyze the behavior of the twists h1i with respect\nto F . Now apart from the change of the sign of the differentials, we obtain the\nrelation:\nF (Mh1i) = F (M)[\u22121]h\u22121i.\nL k\nOn the other hand, let for a complex P \u2022 of graded Ext \u2022A (k, k)-modules P =\nPn\nbe the total module. We may then consider the map \u03c3 on P defined as follows:\np \u2208 Pnk 7\u2192 (\u22121)n p.\nOne now checks that \u03c3 defines an isomorphism between the functors F (\u2212h1i)\nand F (\u2212)[\u22121]h\u22121i.\nRecall once again that since A is Koszul, the DG-algebras\nEnd \u2022A (K \u2022 ) and (Ext \u2022A (k, k), d = 0)\nare quasiisomorphic so there is an equivalence\n\u03c6 : D b (Mod \u2212 End \u2022A (K \u2022 )) \u2192 D b (Mod \u2212(Ext \u2022A (k, k), d = 0)) .\nA closer look at the above quoted proof reveals that the quasiisomorphism is even\na graded one so we obtain an equivalence\n\u03c6 : D b (hEnd \u2022A (K \u2022 )i) \u2192 D b (hExt \u2022A (k, k), d = 0i)\nLet us gather the results in one theorem.\nTheorem 7. The composition of the above functors\nG \u25e6 \u03c6 \u25e6 RHom A (K \u2022 , \u2212) : D b (mof \u2212A) \u2192 D b (mof \u2212 Ext \u2022A (k, k))\nis an equivalence of triangulated categories: the Koszul duality functor. It commutes with [1] and satisfies the rule\nF (Mh1i) = F (M)[\u22121]h\u22121i.\n4. Translation and Zuckerman functors.\nLet us return to the translation functors to and from the wall T0\u03bb : O \u2192 O\u03bb ,\nT\u03bb0 : O \u2192 O\u03bb . We saw in the first section, that they can be viewed as functors\nbetween the categories Mod \u2212A and Mod \u2212A\u03bb . Now, in [2] it is shown that they\ncan be lifted to graded functors\nT0\u03bb : mod \u2212A \u2192 mod \u2212A\u03bb\nT\u03bb0 : mod \u2212A\u03bb \u2192 mod \u2212A\nthat still are adjoint and exact and such that T0\u03bb takes pure objects of weight n\nto pure objects of the same weight; this construction is based on Soergel's theory\nof modules over the coinvariants of the Weyl group. See also [1], where graded\ntranslation functors are constructed in the setting of modular representation theory.\n\n\f10\n\nSTEEN RYOM-HANSEN\n\nThe graded translation functor T0\u03bb induces a homomorphism of graded DGalgebras End \u2022A (K \u2022 ) \u2192 End \u2022A\u03bb (T0\u03bb K \u2022 ). But T0\u03bb and T\u03bb0 are exact and K \u2022 is a\nprojective graded resolution of the pure module k, so T0\u03bb K \u2022 is a projective graded\nresolution of k\u03bb . Hence T0\u03bb K \u2022 is graded homotopic to the Koszul complex K\u03bb\u2022\nof A\u03bb and this implies that End \u2022A\u03bb (T0\u03bb K \u2022 ) and End \u2022A\u03bb (K\u03bb\u2022 ) are quasiisomorphic\ngraded DG-algebras.\nWe already saw that A being a Koszul ring implies that\nEnd \u2022A (K \u2022 ) \u223c\n= (Ext \u2022A (k, k), d = 0)\nand by the above and since A\u03bb is Koszul as well we have that\nEnd \u2022A\u03bb (T0\u03bb K \u2022 ) \u223c\n= (Ext \u2022A\u03bb (k\u03bb , k\u03bb ), d = 0)\n= (Ext \u2022A\u03bb (T0\u03bb k, T0\u03bb k), d = 0) \u223c\nWe now obtain the following commutative diagram of functors:\nD b (mod \u2212A)\n\u2193 T0\u03bb\nD b(mod \u2212A\u03bb )\n\n\u2212 \u2297 K\u2022\n\n\u2190\n\n\u2212 \u2297 T0\u03bb K \u2022\n\n\u2190\n\nD b (hEnd \u2022A (K \u2022 )i)\n\u2193\n\nD b (hExt \u2022A (k, k), d = 0i)\n\u2193 T0\u03bb\n\n\u2190\n\nD b (hEnd \u2022A\u03bb (T0\u03bb K \u2022 )i) \u2190 D b (hExt \u2022A\u03bb (T0\u03bb k, T0\u03bbk), d = 0i)\n\nwhere the middle vertical arrow is the graded tensor product functor\n\u2212 \u2297End \u2022A (K \u2022 ) End \u2022A (T0\u03bb K \u2022 )\nwhile the first and third vertical arrows are the graded translation functors. The\ncommutativity of the first square is here obvious, whereas the quasiisomorphism\nof (Ext \u2022A (k, k), d = 0)) \u00d7 End \u2022A\u03bb (T0\u03bb K \u2022 )-bimodules\nEnd \u2022A (T0\u03bb K \u2022 ) \u223c\n= Ext \u2022A\u03bb (T0\u03bb k, T0\u03bb k)\ngives the natural transformation that makes the second square commutative.\nBy the same reasoning as in the last section, the two lower arrows define\nequivalences of triangulated categories.\nNow Backelin [2] shows that one can choose the isomorphisms Ext \u2022A (k, k) \u2243 A\nand Ext \u2022A\u03bb (T0\u03bb k, T0\u03bb k) \u2243 A\u03bb to obtain the following commutative diagram:\n\u223c\n\nExt \u2022A (k, k)\n\u2212\u2192\nT0\u03bb \u2193\n\u223c\nExt \u2022A\u03bb (T0\u03bb k, T0\u03bb k) \u2212\u2192\n\nA\n\u2193\u03c4\nA\u03bb\n\nThe key point is here that both vertical maps are surjections: for \u03c4 this is clear,\nwhile for T0\u03bb an argument involving the Koszul property of Ais required (one can\nhere give a simple alternate argument along the lines of the Cline, Parshall, Scott\napproach to Kashdan-Luzstig theory [8]). It then follows that the kernels of the\ntwo vertical maps are the ideals generated by corresponding idempotents (thus\nin the degree 0 part).\n\n\fKOSZUL DUALITY OF TRANSLATION-AND ZUCKERMAN FUNCTORS\n\n11\n\nAlthough the diagram involves non-graded maps, it can be used to give \u03c4 a\ngrading \u2013 and then of course it is a commutative diagram of graded homomorphisms.\nThis diagram, on the other hand, gives rise to the following commutative diagram of functors:\nF\n\nD b (hExt \u2022A (k, k), d = 0i)\n\u2190 D b (mod \u2212A)\nT0\u03bb \u2193\n\u2193\u03c4\nF\n\u2022\nb\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\nb\nD (hExt A\u03bb (T0 k, T0 k), d = 0i) \u2190 D (mod \u2212A\u03bb )\nWe now join the two diagrams of functors to obtain a diagram, in which the\nupper arrows compose to the Koszul duality functor of O while the composition\nof the lower arrows is isomorphic to the Koszul duality functor of O\u03bb . Let us\nformulate this as a Theorem\nTheorem 8. The translation\u2013 and Zuckerman functors are Kozsul to each other,\nin other words there is a commutative diagram of functors:\nD b (mod \u2212A)\nT0\u03bb \u2193\n\nD\n\n\u2190\n\nD b (mod \u2212A)\n\u2193\u03c4\n\nD\n\nD b (mod \u2212A\u03bb ) \u2190\u03bb D b (mod \u2212A\u03bb )\nwhere D (resp. D\u03bb ) is the Koszul duality functor as described above.\nThis is the Theorem announced in the introduction of the paper.\n5. The Enright-Shelton Equivalence\nWe now consider the categorification of the Temperley-Lieb algebra. Let thus\ng := gln and O := O(gln ). Let \u01ebk , k \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n} be the standard basis of the\nweight lattice and define for k \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n}, \u03bbk := \u01eb1 + \u01eb2 + . . . \u01ebk . We then let\nOk,n\u2212k be the singular block of O consisting of modules with central character\n\u03b8(\u03bbk ). So the Verma module with highest weight \u03bbk \u2212 \u03c1 lies in Ok,n\u2212k . Let\ngi , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 i \u2212 1 be the subalgebra of g consisting of the matrices whose entries\nare nonzero only on the intersection of the i-th and (i + 1)-th rows and columns.\ni\nWe then denote by Ok,n\u2212k\nthe parabolic subcategory of Ok,n\u2212k whose modules\nare the locally gi -finite ones in Ok,n\u2212k .\nWe shall also consider the following dual picture: let pk be the parabolic subalgebra of g, whose Levi part is gk \u2295 gn\u2212k and such that n+ \u2286 pk and let Ok,n\u2212k be\nthe the full subcategory of O consisting of the locally pk -finite modules. Choose\nan integral dominant regular weight \u03bc and integral dominant subregular weights\n\u03bci on the i-th wall, i = 1, 2, . . . , n \u2212 1 (so the coordinates of \u03bci in the \u01ebi basis\nare strictly decreasing, except for the i-th and the (i + 1)-th that are equal). Let\nfinally Oik,n\u2212k be the subcategory of Ok,n\u2212k with central character \u03b8(\u03bci ).\nAll of this is the setup of [6]\n\n\f12\n\nSTEEN RYOM-HANSEN\n\ni\nLet Rk,n\u2212k\n(resp.Rik,n\u2212k ) be the endomorphism ring of the minimal projective\ni\ngenerator of Ok,n\u2212k\n(resp. Oik,n\u2212k ). The following theorem is a direct consequence\nof Backelin's work [2]:\ni\nTheorem 9. (Rk,n\u2212k\n)! = Rik,n\u2212k\n\nProof. The main result of [2] is that\n\u03c6\n(R\u03c6\u03c8 )! = R\u2212w\n0\u03c8\n\nwith the notation as in [5].\nNowP\none should first observe that c Id \u2208 gln acts on O\u03bb through multiplication\nwith c \u03bbi ; hence O\u03bb is equivalent to the category O\u03bb of sln -modules, where\n\u03bbP\ndenotes the image of \u03bb under the projection of the weight lattice with kernel\nZ \u01ebi . We can thus restrict ourselves to the semisimple situation and may indeed\nuse the results quoted.\nNow \u03bci and sli \u2286 sln are both given by the simple root \u03b1i = \u01ebi \u2212 \u01ebi+1 and also\npk,n\u2212k and \u03bbk are given by the same simple roots (= \u2206 \\ {\u03b1i }). Finally, we have\nin type A that w0 \u03bb = \u2212\u03bb and the theorem follows.\n\u0003\nAs a corollary we obtain a simple proof of the following equivalence of categories\nfirst proven by Enright and Shelton.\nCorollary 1. O1k,n\u2212k \u223c\n= Ok\u22121,n\u2212k\u22121\nProof. There is first of all a standard equivalence of categories:\n1\n\u223c\nOk,n\u2212k\n= Ok\u22121,n\u2212k\u22121\n\nThe functor \u03bdn from left to right takes the sum of all weight spaces of weight\n\u01eb1 + x3 \u01eb3 + . . . xn \u01ebn \u2212 \u03c1n with xi \u2208 Z. This is a gln\u22122 -module and \u03bdn is then the\ntensor product of it with the module defined by \u01eb1 + \u01eb2 + . . . \u01ebn\u22122 . The inverse\nfunctor comes from an induction procedure, see [6] for the details. Now this\nequivalence gives us a ring isomorphism\n1\n(Rk,n\u2212k\n)! \u223c\n= (Rk\u22121,n\u2212k\u22121)!\n\nwhich combined with the theorem yields a ring isomorphism\n\u03be : R1k,n\u2212k \u223c\n= Rk\u22121,n\u2212k\u22121\nBut then the module categories of R1k,n\u2212k and Rk\u22121,n\u2212k\u22121 are equivalent, by the\nrestriction and extension of scalars along \u03be. The corollary is proved.\n\u0003\nThis might be useful in proving the full conjectures of [6].\n\n\fKOSZUL DUALITY OF TRANSLATION-AND ZUCKERMAN FUNCTORS\n\n13\n\nReferences\n[1] Andersen, H. H. J. C.
