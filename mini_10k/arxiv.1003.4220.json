The ultimate ambition of this workshop is to\npromote the MPI as unification concept between seemingly heterogeneous research lines and to profit of\nthe complete experimental picture in order to constrain their implementation in the models, evaluating\nthe spin offs on the LHC physics program.

For the first time since\nthe LEP experiments the sensitivity for a Standard Model Higgs boson\nhas been reached at a Higgs boson mass of 170 GeV/c2 .\n1 Introduction\nIn the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics the Higgs mechanism is responsible for breaking\nelectroweak symmetry, thereby giving mass to the W and Z bosons. It predicts the existence\nof a heavy scalar boson, the Higgs boson, with a mass that can not be predicted by the SM.\nDirect searches for the Higgs Boson were performed at the LEP experiments in the process\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 ZH with a centre of mass energy of 206.6 GeV. A direct mass limit at mH > 114.4\nGeV/c2 [1] was set at the 95% confidence level (CL)1 . This limit is slightly below the maximum\navailable kinematic limit due to a small excess observed in the LEP data.\nIndirect limits have been placed on the Higgs boson mass by the LEP, SLD and Tevatron experiments from electroweak precision measurements [2]. The main contribution to these\nindirect constraints from the Tevatron experiments, D\u00d8 and CDF, are the measurements of\nthe W Boson and top quark masses [2]. The dependence of the Higgs mass on these measurements is shown in Figure 1 on the left and the Higgs mass dependence on the measured\nelectroweak precision parameters in Figure 1 on the right. The SM fit yields a best value of\n2\n2\nmH = 84+34\n\u221226 GeV/c [3]. The upper limit on the Higgs mass at 95% CL is mH < 154 GeV/c .\nIf the direct mass limit is also taken into account this limit is increased to mH < 185 GeV/c2 .\n2 Higgs Searches at the Tevatron\nThe Tevatron experiments CDF [4] and D\u00d8 [5] search for direct Higgs boson production in the\n\u221a\nmass range above the LEP limit using pp\u0304 collisions at s = 1.96 TeV. The relevant processes\nat these energies are associated Higgs production (qq \ufffd \u2192 W H, q q\u0304 \u2192 ZH) and gluon fusion\n(gg \u2192 H). Typical cross-sections are \u03c3 \ufffd 0.7 \u2212 0.15 pb for gluon fusion and \u03c3 \ufffd 0.2 \u2212 0.02 pb\nfor associated production at Higgs masses in the range 115 \u2212 200 GeV/c2 .\n\nThe Higgs boson predominantly decays into bb\u0304 quark pairs in the low mass range below\n135 GeV/c2 . Hence the signal in the gg \u2192 H channel is overwhelmed by multi-jet background.\nThis makes the process gg \u2192 H therefore not a viable search channel at low Higgs boson\nmasses. The W H and ZH channels, where the vector boson decays into leptons, have much\nlower cross-sections but the lepton tag from the decay of the W \u2192 \ufffd\u03bd or Z \u2192 \ufffd\ufffd and selections\n1\n\nAll limits given in this paper are at 95% CL\n\nMPI08\n\n3\n\n\fJuly 2008\n\n80.5\n\n6\n\nLEP2 and Tevatron (prel.)\nLEP1 and SLD\n\nmLimit = 154 GeV\n\nJuly 2008\n\nTheory uncertainty\n\u0394\u03b1(5)\nhad =\n\n5\n\n0.02758\u00b10.00035\n0.02749\u00b10.00012\nincl. low Q2 data\n\n4\n\n\u0394\u03c72\n\nmW [GeV]\n\n68% CL\n\n80.4\n\n3\n2\n\n80.3\n\nmH [GeV]\n114\n300\n150\n\n1\n\n\u0394\u03b1\n\n1000\n175\n\n200\n\nmt [GeV]\n\n0\n\nExcluded\n30\n\nPreliminary\n\n100\n\n300\n\nmH [GeV]\n\nFig. 1: Constraints on the Higgs mass from precision top and W mass measurements (left) and fit for the Higgs Mass\nfrom the W data showing the direct search LEP limit (right)\n\non missing transverse energy from the neutrino in the decays W \u2192 \ufffd\u03bd or Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd help to reduce\nthe background significantly.\nAt higher masses, around mH = 165 GeV/c2 , the Higgs boson will predominantly decay\ninto W W pairs. Leptons from the decays of the W bosons and the missing transverse energy\nare used to reject background, making the channel gg \u2192 H \u2192 W W the most promising search\nchannel in this mass region. A 'hybrid' channel, the associated production with subsequent Higgs\ndecay into (virtual) W pairs, qq \ufffd \u2192 W H \u2192 W W W , also contributes in the intermediate mass\nregion.\n2.1\n\nThe Tools\n\nThe main tools employed in Higgs searches at the Tevatron are lepton identification and - especially in the low Higgs mass region - jet reconstruction and b jet tagging. The experiments use b\njet tagging algorithms that exploit the long lifetime of b hadrons. These algorithms are applied\nto each jet, searching for tracks with large transverse impact parameters relative to the primary\nvertex and for secondary vertices formed by tracks in the jet.\nTo further improve the b jet tagging these variables are used as input to a artificial Neural\nNetwork (NN) jet-flavor separator. The NN is trained to separate b quark jets from light flavour\njets. By adjusting the minimum requirement on the NN output variable, a range of increasingly\nstringent b tagging operating points is obtained, each with a different signal efficiency and purity.\nUsing this tool at D\u00d8 , b tagging efficiencies have been improved by 33% while keeping the rate\nof falsely identified light flavor jets (mistags) low. The efficiencies range between 40-70% for b\n4\n\nMPI08\n\n\fjets at a low mistag rates between 0.5-3% for light flavor jets.\nAlmost all Higgs searches at the Tevatron employ advanced analysis techniques like artificial Neural Networks (NN), boosted decision trees (BDT) or matrix element techniques (ME)\nto combine kinematic characteristics of signal and background events into a single discriminant.\nThese techniques improve the separation of signal to background over the invariant Higgs boson\nmass distribution which is the most important single variable. Careful validation of all input\nvariables is mandatory for robust results.\nEvents with neutrinos in the final state are identified using missing transverse energy. The\nreconstruction of all these variables require excellent performance of all detector components.\n2.2\n\nSignal and Background\n\nThe Higgs signal is simulated with PYTHIA [6]. The signal cross-sections are normalised\nto next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) calculations [7, 8] and branching ratios from HDECAY [9].\nThere are many types of background to the Higgs search. An important source of background are multi-jet events (often labeled \"QCD background\"). This background and the instrumental background due to mis-identified leptons or b jets is either simulated with PYTHIA (only\nfor the CDF ZH \u2192 \u03bd\u03bdbb\u0304 analysis) or is taken directly from data, since it is not very well simulated by Monte Carlo. Determining this background from data is done using control samples\nwith no signal content.\nElectroweak background processes such as di-boson production, pp\u0304 \u2192 V V (V = W, Z),\nV +jets or tt\u0304 pair production often dominate at the final stages of the selection; these are simulated using leading order Monte Carlo programs such as PYTHIA, ALPGEN, HERWIG or\nCOMPHEP. The normalisation of these processes is obtained either from data or from NLO\ncalculations.\n2.3\n\nSearch for W H \u2192 \ufffd\u03bdbb\u0304\n\nOne of the most sensitive channels for a low Higgs boson mass is the decay W H \u2192 \ufffd\u03bdbb\u0304. This\nfinal state consists of two b jets from the Higgs boson and a charged lepton \ufffd and a neutrino\nfrom the W boson. All three leptonic decays of the W boson are analysed at D\u00d8 , with the\nmost sensitive being the decays to electrons and muons. Events are selected with one or two b\ntagged jets an isolated electron or muon and missing transverse energy. The main backgrounds\nafter selection are W +jets and tt\u0304 production. The di-jet invariant mass distribution for events\nwith two b-tags is shown in Figure 2 on the left side. To improve the separation between the\nsignal and the irreducible background a NN is trained which takes a number of kinematic and\ntopological variables as input. The output of this NN is used to extract limits on Higgs production\nand is shown in Figure 2 on the right side. The analysis uses 1.7 fb \u22121 of recorded data and sets\nan observed (expected) limit on \u03c395 /\u03c3SM = 9.1(8.5) for a Higgs boson mass mH = 115 GeV/c2\n(where \u03c3SM is the cross section predicted for this process by the Standard Model). A dedicated\nsearch for W \u00b1 H \u2192 \u03c4 \u00b1 \u03bdbb\u0304 with hadronic \u03c4 decays has been added at D\u00d8. Using the di-jet\nmass distribution to separate signal from background an observed (expected) limit on \u03c395 /\u03c3SM =\n35.4 (42.1) for a Higgs boson mass mH = 115 GeV/c2 has been obtained in that channel.

With the two b-jets being boosted in the transverse direction, the\nsignature for the final state are acoplanar di-jets and large missing transverse energy. Thus is in\ncontrast to most background di-jet events which are expected to be back-to-back in the transverse\nplane. The main background sources in this search channel are W boson or Z boson production\nin association with heavy flavour jets, multi-jet events and tt\u0304 pairs.\nThe basic selection requires at least one (CDF) or two jets (D\u00d8) with a b tag, large missing\ntransverse energy (ETmiss > 50 GeV), and a veto on any isolated muon or electron in the event.\nIn the CDF analysis, the final sample is divided into three samples, one sample with exactly\none tight secondary vertex b tag, the second sample with one tight secondary vertex b tag and one\ntag with the JetProb algorithm and a third sample with two tight secondary vertex b tags. Two\nNNs are trained one against the dominant QCD background (see Figure 3 on the left side for the\nsecond b-tag sample) and one against di-boson and tt\u0304 background (see Figure 3 on the right side\nfor the second sample), which is also used to extract limits on the production cross section.\nIn the case of D\u00d8, events with two NN b tags are used to construct a BDT for identifying\nsignal events. Asymmetric operating points, one loose and one tight, are chosen for the two b\n6\n\nMPI08\n\n\fQCD Rejection NN, Signal Region, ST+JP\n\nNN Output, Signal Region, ST+JP\n-1\n\n-1\n\nCDF Run II Preliminary, 2.1 fb\n\n160\n140\n\nCDF Run II Preliminary, 2.1 fb\n\n50\n\nData\n\nData\n\nMultijet\n\nMultijet\n\nTop Pair\n\nTop Pair\n\nSingle Top\n\nSingle Top\n\n40\n\nDiboson\n\n120\n\nDiboson\n\nW+H.F.\n\nW+H.F.\n\nZ+H.F.\n\nZ+H.F.\n\nBackground Error\n\n100\n\nBackground Error\n\n30\n\nVH115\u00d75\n\nVH115\u00d75\n\n80\n20\n\n60\n40\n\n10\n\n20\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n1\nQCD NN\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n1\n1.5\nNeural Network Output\n\nFig. 3: CDF ZH \u2192 \u03bd\u03bdbb\u0304 channel: NN output distribution to separate against the dominate QCD background (left)\nand the NN distribution for the remaining backgrounds (right).\n\nEvents / 0.05\n\nEvents / 12.00 GeV\n\ntags.

D\u00d8 defines three final states (e+ e\u2212 , e\u00b1 \u03bc\u2213 ,\nand \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ). CDF separates the H \u2192 W + W \u2212 events into five non-overlapping samples, first\nby separating the events by jet multiplicity (0, 1 or 2), then subdviding the 0 and 1 jet samples\nin two, one having a low signal/bacgkround (S/B) ratio, the other having a higher one. In these\nanalyses, the final discriminants are neural-network outputs based on several kinematic variables.\nThese include likelihoods constructed from matrix-element probabilities as input to the neural\nnetwork for CDF and is shown on the right side of Figure 6. The background subtracted NN\ndistribution for D\u00d8 is shown in Figure7 on the left side. This distribution has been used to extract\nmedian observed (expected) limits on the production cross-section of \u03c395 /\u03c3SM = 1.9 (2.0) for\nmH = 165 GeV/c2 . The obtained limits on the production cross-section as a function of the\nHiggs boson mass are shown in Figure 7 on the right side. With the NN distributions CDF\nobtains \u03c395 /\u03c3SM = 1.7(1.6) for mH = 165 GeV/c2 .

This process is important in the intermediate\nmass range. The signature is at least two isolated leptons from the W decays with pT > 15 GeV\nand identical charge. The associated W and one of the two W bosons from the Higgs decay\nshould have the same charge. For the final signal selection D\u00d8 used a two-dimensional likelihood\nbased on the invariant mass of the two leptons, the missing transverse energy and their azimuthal\nangular correlations.\nThis same-sign charge requirement is very powerful in rejecting background from Z production. The remaining background is either due to di-boson production or due to charge mismeasurements. The rate of charge mis-measurements for muons is determined by comparing\nthe independent charge measurements within the solenoidal and in the toroidal fields of the D\u00d8\nMPI08\n\n9\n\n\f-\n\nLimit / \u03c3(pp \u2192H)\u00d7 BR(H\u2192W +W )\n\nD\u00d8 Preliminary, L=3.0 fb-1\nH\u2192 W + W\n\nObserved Limit\nExpected Limit\nExpected \u00b1 1-\u03c3\nExpected \u00b1 2-\u03c3\n\n10\n\n1\n\nStandard Model = 1.0\n\n120\n\n130\n\n140\n\n150\n\n160\n\n170\n\n180\n\n190\n\n200\n\nmH (GeV/c2)\n\nFig. 7: D\u00d8 W W channel: The background subtracted distribution of the NN (left) and the obtained median observed\nand expected limits on the production cross-section (right).\n\ndetector.

To gain confidence that the final result does not depend on the details of the\nstatistical method applied, several types of combination were performed, using both Modified\nFrequentist (sometimes called the LEP CLs method) and Bayesian approaches. The results\nagree within about 10%. Both methods use Poisson likelihoods and rely on distributions of the\nfinal discriminants, e.g. NN output or di-jet mass distributions, not only on event counting.\nSystematic uncertainties enter as uncertainties on the expected number of signal and background events, as well as on the shape of the discriminant distributions. The correlations of\nsystematic uncertainties between channels, different background sources, background and signal\nand between experiments are taken into account. The main sources of systematic uncertainties\nare, depending on channel, the luminosity and normalisation, the estimates of the multi-jet backgrounds, the input cross-sections used for the MC generated background sources, the higher order\ncorrections (K factors) needed to describe heavy flavour jet production, the jet energy scale, b\ntagging and lepton identification.\nThe combinations of results of each single experiment, yield the following ratios of 95%\nC.L. observed (expected) limits to the SM cross section: 4.2 (3.6) for CDF and 5.3 (4.6) for D\u00d8\nat mH = 115 GeV/c2 , and 1.8 (1.9) for CDF and 1.7 (2.3) for D\u00d8 at mH = 170 GeV/c2 .\nThe ratios of the 95% C.L. expected and observed limit to the SM cross section are shown\nin Figure 8 for the combined CDF and D\u00d8 analyses on the left side.

The results will be compared with a similar\nstudy of the \"underlying event\" using charged particles produced in association with large\ntransverse momentum jets. The data are corrected to the particle level to remove detector effects\nand are then compared with several QCD Monte-Carlo models. Some extrapolations of Drell-Yan\nproduction to the LHC are also presented.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn order to find \"new\" physics at a hadron-hadron collider it is essential to have MonteCarlo models that simulate accurately the \"ordinary\" QCD hard-scattering events. To do this\none must not only have a good model of the hard scattering part of the process, but also of the\nbeam-beam remnants (BBR) and the multiple parton interactions (MPI). The \"underlying event\"\n(i.e. BBR plus MPI) is an unavoidable background to most collider observables and a good\nunderstanding of it will lead to more precise measurements at the Tevatron and the LHC. Fig. 1.1\nillustrates the way the QCD Monte-Carlo models simulate a proton-antiproton collision in which\na \"hard\" 2-to-2 parton scattering with transverse momentum, pT(hard), has occurred. The\nresulting event contains particles that originate from the two outgoing partons (plus initial and\nfinal-state radiation) and particles that come from the breakup of the proton and antiproton (i.e.\nBBR). The \"beam-beam remnants\" are what is left over after a parton is knocked out of each of\nthe initial two beam hadrons. It is one of the reasons hadron-hadron collisions are more \"messy\"\nthan electron-positron annihilations and no one really knows how it should be modeled. For the\nQCD Monte-Carlo models the \"beam-beam remnants\" are an important component of the\n\"underlying event\". Also, multiple parton scatterings contribute to the \"underlying event\",\nproducing a \"hard\" component to the \"underlying event\". Fig. 1.2 shows the way PYTHIA [1]\nmodels the \"underlying event\" in proton-antiproton collision by including multiple parton\ninteractions. In addition to the hard 2-to-2 parton-parton scattering and the \"beam-beam\nremnants\", sometimes there are additional \"semi-hard\" 2-to-2 parton-parton scattering that\ncontribute particles to the \"underlying event\". The \"hard scattering\" component consists of the\noutgoing two jets plus initial and final-state radiation.\nAs illustrated in Fig. 1.3, the \"underlying event\" consists of particles that arise from the\nBBR plus MPI, however, these two components cannot be uniquely separated from particles that\ncome from the initial and final-state radiation. Hence, a study of the \"underlying event\"\ninevitably involves a study of the BBR plus MPI plus initial and final-state radiation. As shown\nin Fig. 1.4, Drell-Yan lepton-pair production provides an excellent place to study the\n\"underlying event\". Here one studies the outgoing charged particles (excluding the lepton pair)\nas a function of the lepton-pair invariant mass and as a function of the lepton-pair transverse\n1\n\nThis work was done in collaboration with my graduate student Deepak Kar and my former graduate student Craig Group.\n\n12\n\nMPI08\n\n\fmomentum.

The \"hard scattering\"\ncomponent of the event consists of the two outgoing leptons plus particles that result from initial-state radiation. The\n\"underlying event\" consists of particles that arise from the \"beam-beam remnants\" and from multiple parton interactions.\n\nHard scattering collider \"jet\" events have a distinct topology. On the average, the outgoing\nhadrons \"remember\" the underlying 2-to-2 hard scattering subprocess. A typical hard scattering\nevent consists of a collection (or burst) of hadrons traveling roughly in the direction of the initial\ntwo beam particles and two collections of hadrons (i.e. \"jets\") with large transverse momentum.\nThe two large transverse momentum \"jets\" are roughly back to back in azimuthal angle. One\ncan use the topological structure of hadron-hadron collisions to study the \"underlying event\".\nWe use the direction of the leading jet in each event to define four regions of K-I space. As\nillustrated in Fig. 1.5, the direction of the leading jet, jet#1, in high pT jet production or the Zboson in Drell-Yan production is used to define correlations in the azimuthal angle, 'I. The\nangle 'I = I \u2013 Ijet#1 ('I = I \u2013 IZ) is the relative azimuthal angle between a charged particle and\nthe direction of jet#1 (direction of the Z-boson). The \"toward\" region is defined by |'I | < 60o\nand |K| < 1, while the \"away\" region is |'I | > 120o and |K| < 1. The two \"transverse\" regions 60o\n< 'I < 120o and 60o < -'I < 120o are referred to as \"transverse 1\" and \"transverse 2\". The\noverall \"transverse\" region corresponds to combining the \"transverse 1\" and \"transverse 2\"\nregions. In high pT jet production, the \"toward\" and \"away\" regions receive large contributions\nfrom the to the outgoing high pT jets, while the \"transverse\" region is perpendicular to the plane\nof the hard 2-to-2 scattering and is therefore very sensitive to the \"underlying event\". For DrellYan production both the \"toward\" and the \"transverse\" region are very sensitive to the\n\"underlying event\", while the \"away\" region receives large contributions from the \"away-side\"\njet from the 2-to-2 processes: q \u000e q o Z \u000e g , q \u000e g o Z \u000e q , q \u000e g o Z \u000e q .\nJet #1 Direction\n\nZ-Boson Direction\n\n'I\u0003\n\"Toward\"\n\"Trans 1\"\n\n\"Trans 2\"\n\n\"Away\"\n\n'I\u0003\n\"Toward\"\n\"Trans 1\"\n\n\"Trans 2\"\n\n\"Away\"\n\nFig. 1.5.

We examine charged particles in the range pT >\n0.5 GeV/c and |K| < 1 and |K| < 1. For high pT jet production, we require that the leading jet in the event be in the region\n|K(jet#1)| < 2 (referred to as \"leading jet\" events). For Drell-Yan production we require that invariant mass of the lepton-pair be\nin the region 81 < M(pair) < 101 GeV/c2 with |K(pair)| < 6 (referred to as \"Z-boson\" events).\n\nAs illustrated in Fig. 1.6, we study charged particles in the range pT > 0.5 GeV/c and |K| <\n1 in the \"toward\", \"away\" and \"transverse\" regions.

The angle 'I is the relative azimuthal angle between charged particles and the direction of jet#1 or the Z-boson.\nOn an event by event basis, we define \"transMAX\" (\"transMIN\") to be the maximum (minimum) of the two \"transverse\"\nregions, 60o < 'I < 120o and 60o < -'I < 120o. \"TransMAX\" and \"transMIN\" each have an area in K-I space of 'K'I = 4S/6.\nThe overall \"transverse\" region includes both the \"transMAX\" and the \"transMIN\" region.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 1.7, for both \"leading jet\" and \"Z-boson\" events we define a variety of\nMAX and MIN \"transverse\" regions (\"transMAX\" and \"transMIN\") which helps separate the\n\"hard component\" (initial and final-state radiation) from the \"beam-beam remnant\" component\n[2]. MAX (MIN) refer to the \"transverse\" region containing largest (smallest) number of\ncharged particles or to the region containing the largest (smallest) scalar pT sum of charged\nparticles. For events with large initial or final-state radiation the \"transMAX\" region would\n\nMPI08\n\n15\n\n\fcontain the third jet in high pT jet production or the second jet in Drell-Yan production while\nboth the \"transMAX\" and \"transMIN\" regions receive contributions from the beam-beam\nremnants. Thus, the \"transMIN\" region is very sensitive to the beam-beam remnants, while the\n\"transMAX\" minus the \"transMIN\" (i.e. \"transDIF\") is very sensitive to initial and final-state\nradiation.\nTable 1.1. Observables examined in this analysis as they are defined at the particle level and the\ndetector level. Charged tracks are considered \"good\" if they pass the track selection criterion. The\nmean charged particle <pT> is constructed on an event-by-event basis and then averaged over the\nevents. For the average pT and the PTmax we require that there is at least one charge particle present.\nThe PTsum density is taken to be zero if there are no charged particles present.

Table 1.1 shows\nthe observables that are considered in this analysis as they are defined at the particle level and\ndetector level. Since we will be studying regions in K-I space with different areas, we will\nconstruct densities by dividing by the area. For example, the number density, dN/dKdI,\ncorresponds the number of charged particles per unit K-I and the PTsum density, dPT/dKdI,\ncorresponds the amount of charged scalar pT sum per unit K-I. The corrected observables are\nthen compared with QCD Monte-Carlo predictions at the particle level (i.e. generator level).\n\n2. QCD Monte-Carlo Model Tunes\nPYTHIA Tune A was determined by fitting the CDF Run 1 \"underlying event\" data [3] and,\nat that time, we did not consider the \"Z-boson\" data. Tune A does not fit the CDF Run 1 Z-boson\npT distribution very well [4]. PYTHIA Tune AW fits the Z-boson pT distribution as well as the\n\"underlying event\" at the Tevatron [5]. For \"leading jet\" production Tune A and Tune AW are\nnearly identical. Table 2.1 shows the parameters for several PYTHIA 6.2 tunes. PYTHIA Tune\nDW is very similar to Tune AW except PARP(67) = 2.5, which is the preferred value determined\nby D\u00d8 in fitting their dijet 'I distribution [6]. PARP(67) sets the high pT scale for initial-state\nradiation in PYTHIA. It determines the maximal parton virtuality allowed in time-like showers.\nTune DW and Tune DWT are identical at 1.96 TeV, but Tune DW and DWT extrapolate\n\n16\n\nMPI08\n\n\fdifferently to the LHC. Tune DWT uses the ATLAS energy dependence, PARP(90) = 0.16,\nwhile Tune DW uses the Tune A value of PARP(90) = 0.25. All these tunes use CTEQ5L.\nThe first 9 parameters in Table 2.1 tune the multiple parton interactions (MPI). PARP(62),\nPARP(64), and PARP(67) tune the initial-state radiation and the last three parameters set the\nintrinsic kT of the partons within the incoming proton and antiproton.\nTable 2.1. Parameters for several PYTHIA 6.2 tunes. Tune A is the CDF Run 1 \"underlying event\" tune.\nTune AW and DW are CDF Run 2 tunes which fit the existing Run 2 \"underlying event\" data and fit the Run\n1 Z-boson pT distribution. The ATLAS Tune is the tune used in the ATLAS TRD. Tune DWT use the\nATLAS energy dependence for the MPI, PARP(90). The first 9 parameters tune the multiple parton\ninteractions. PARP(62), PARP(64), and PARP(67) tune the initial-state radiation and the last three\nparameters set the intrinsic kT of the partons within the incoming proton and antiproton.\n\nParameter\nPDF\nMSTP(81)\nMSTP(82)\nPARP(82)\nPARP(83)\nPARP(84)\nPARP(85)\nPARP(86)\nPARP(89)\nPARP(90)\nPARP(62)\nPARP(64)\nPARP(67)\nMSTP(91)\nPARP(91)\nPARP(93)\n\nTune\nA\nCTEQ5L\n1\n4\n2.0\n0.5\n0.4\n0.9\n0.95\n1800\n0.25\n1.0\n1.0\n4.0\n1\n1.0\n5.0\n\nTune\nAW\nCTEQ5L\n1\n4\n2.0\n0.5\n0.4\n0.9\n0.95\n1800\n0.25\n1.25\n0.2\n4.0\n1\n2.1\n15.0\n\nTune\nDW\nCTEQ5L\n1\n4\n1.9\n0.5\n0.4\n1.0\n1.0\n1800\n0.25\n1.25\n0.2\n2.5\n1\n2.1\n15.0\n\nTune\nDWT\nCTEQ5L\n1\n4\n1.9409\n0.5\n0.4\n1.0\n1.0\n1960\n0.16\n1.25\n0.2\n2.5\n1\n2.1\n15.0\n\nATLAS\nCTEQ5L\n1\n4\n1.8\n0.5\n0.5\n0.33\n0.66\n1000\n0.16\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1\n1.0\n5.0\n\nTable 2.2.

CDF results\n3.1 \"Leading Jet\" and \"Z-Boson\" Topologies\nFig. 3.1 and Fig. 3.2 show the data on the density of charged particles and the scalar\nPTsum density, respectively, for the \"toward\", \"away\", and \"transverse\" regions for \"leading jet\"\nand \"Z-boson\" events. For \"leading jet\" events the densities are plotted as a function of the\nleading jet pT and for \"Z-boson\" events there are plotted versus pT(Z). The data are corrected to\nthe particle level and are compared with PYTHIA Tune A (\"leading jet\") and Tune AW (\"Zboson\") at the particle level (i.e. generator level). For \"leading jet\" events at high pT(jet#1) the\ndensities in the \"toward\" and \"away\" regions are much larger than in the \"transverse\" region\nbecause of the \"toward-side\" and \"away-side\" jets. At small pT(jet#1) the \"toward\", \"away\", and\n\"transverse\" densities become equal and go to zero as pT(jet#1) goes to zero. As the leading jet\ntransverse momentum becomes small all three regions are populated by the underlying event and\nif the leading jet has no transverse momentum then there are no charged particles anywhere.\nThere are a lot of low transverse momentum jets and for pT(jet#1) < 30 GeV/c and the leading jet\nis not always the jet resulting from the hard 2-to-2 scattering. This produces a \"bump\" in the\n\"transverse\" density in the range where the \"toward\", \"away\", and \"transverse\" densities become\nsimilar in size. For \"Z-boson\" events the \"toward\" and \"transverse\" densities are both small and\nalmost equal. The \"away\" density is large due to the \"away-side\" jet. The \"toward\", \"away\",\nand \"transverse\" densities become equal as pT(Z) goes to zero, but unlike the \"leading jet\" case\nthe densities do not vanish at pT(Z) = 0. For \"Z-boson\" events with pT(Z) = 0 the hard scale is\nset by the Z-boson mass, whereas in \"leading jet\" events the hard scale goes to zero as the\ntransverse momentum of the leading jet goes to zero.\nFig. 3.3 compares the data for \"leading jet\" events with the data for \"Z-boson\" events for\nthe density of charged particles in the \"transverse\" region. The data are compared with PYTHIA\nTune A (\"leading jet\") , Tune AW (\"Z-boson\"), and HERWIG (without MPI). For large\npT(jet#1) the \"transverse\" densities are similar for \"leading jet\" and \"Z-boson\" events as one\nwould expect. HERWIG (without MPI) does not produce enough activity in the \"transverse\"\nregion for either process. HERWIG (without MPI) disagrees more with the \"transverse\" region\nof \"Z-boson\" events than it does with the \"leading jet\" events. This is because there is no finalstate radiation in \"Z-boson\" production so that the lack of MPI becomes more evident.\nFig. 3.4 compares the data for \"leading jet\" events with the data for \"Z-boson\" events for\nthe average charged particle pT in the \"transverse\" region.

Fig. 3.6 and Fig. 3.7 show the data for \"Z-boson\" events for the\ndensity of charged particles and the scalar PTsum density, respectively, in the \"toward\" and\n\"transMIN\" regions. The data are compared with PYTHIA Tune AW, Tune DW, the PYTHIA\nATLAS tune. HERWIG (without MPI), and HERWIG (with JIMMY MPI). The densities are\nsmaller in the \"transMIN\" region than in the \"toward\" region and this is described well by\nMPI08\n\n23\n\n\fPYTHIA Tune AW. Comparing HERWIG (without MPI) with HERWIG (with JIMMY MPI)\nclearly shows the importance of MPI in these regions. Tune AW and Tune DW are very\nsimilar. The ATLAS tune and HERWIG (with JIMMY MPI) agree with Tune AW for the scalar\nPTsum density in the \"toward\" and \"transMIN\" regions. However, both the ATLAS tune and\nHERWIG (with JIMMY MPI) produce too much charged particle density in these regions. The\nATLAS tune and HERWIG (with JIMMY MPI) fit the PTsum density, but they do so by\nproducing too many charged particles (i.e. they both have to \"soft\" of a pT spectrum in these\nregions). This can be seen clearly in Fig. 3.8 which shows the data for \"Z-boson\" events on the\naverage charged particle pT and the average maximum charged particle pT, in the \"toward\"\nregion compared with the QCD Monte-Carlo models.\n\nCharged PTsum Density (GeV/c)\n\nCharged PTsum Density: dPT/dKdI\n1.2\n\n\"Drell-Yan Production\"\n70 < M(pair) < 110 GeV\n\nCDF Run 2 Preliminary\ndata corrected\npyAW generator level\n\n0.8\n\"Toward\"\n\n0.4\nCharged Particles (|K|<1.0, PT>0.5 GeV/c)\nexcluding the lepton-pair\n\n\"transMIN\"\n\n0.0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nPT(Z-Boson) (GeV/c)\n\n\"Toward\" PTsum Density (GeV/c)\n\n\"Toward\" Charged PTsum Density: dPT/dKdI\n1.2\n\nCDF Run 2 Preliminary\n\n\"Drell-Yan Production\"\n70 < M(pair) < 110 GeV\n\ndata corrected\ngenerator level theory\n\nATLAS\n\npyDW\n\n0.8\n\nJIM\n\n0.4\n\nHW\n\n0.0\n0\n\npyAW\n\n20\n\n40\n\nCharged Particles (|K|<1.0, PT>0.5 GeV/c)\nexcluding the lepton-pair\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nPT(Z-Boson) (GeV/c)\n\n\"TransMIN\" Charged PTsum Density: dPT/dKdI\n\"TransMIN\" PTsum Density (GeV/c)\n\n0.8\n\nCDF Run 2 Preliminary\n\n\"Drell-Yan Production\"\n70 < M(pair) < 110 GeV\n\ndata corrected\ngenerator level theory\n\n0.6\n\nATLAS\n\npyDW\n\nJIM\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\npyAW\n\n0.0\n0\n\nCharged Particles (|K|<1.0, PT>0.5 GeV/c)\nexcluding the lepton-pair\n\nHW\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nPT(Z-Boson) (GeV/c)\n\nFig. 3.7.

The inelastic cross section consists of three terms; single diffraction, doublediffraction, and everything else (referred to as the \"hard core\"), VIN = VSD + VDD + VHC. For\nelastic scattering neither of the beam particles breaks apart (i.e. color singlet exchange). For\nsingle and double diffraction one or both of the beam particles are excited into a high mass color\n26\n\nMPI08\n\n\fsinglet state (i.e. N* states) which then decays. Single and double diffraction also corresponds to\ncolor singlet exchange between the beam hadrons. When color is exchanged the outgoing\nremnants are no longer color singlets and one has a separation of color resulting in a multitude of\nquark-antiquark pairs being pulled out of the vacuum. The \"hard core\" component, VHC,\ninvolves color exchange and the separation of color. However, the \"hard core\" contribution has\nboth a \"soft\" and \"hard\" component. Most of the time the color exchange between partons in\nthe beam hadrons occurs through a soft interaction (i.e. no high transverse momentum) and the\ntwo beam hadrons \"ooze\" through each other producing lots of soft particles with a uniform\ndistribution in rapidity and many particles flying down the beam pipe. Occasionally there is a\nhard scattering among the constituent partons producing outgoing particles and \"jets\" with high\ntransverse momentum.\nMinimum bias (i.e. \"min-bias\") is a generic term which refers to events that are selected with\na \"loose\" trigger that accepts a large fraction of the inelastic cross section. All triggers produce\nsome bias and the term \"min-bias\" is meaningless until one specifies the precise trigger used to\ncollect the data. The CDF \"min-bias\" trigger consists of requiring at least one charged particle\nin the forward region 3.2 < K < 5.9 and simultaneously at least one charged particle in the\nbackward region -5.9 < K < -3.2. Monte-Carlo studies show that the CDF \"min-bias\" collects\nmost of the VHC contribution plus small amounts of single and double diffraction.\nMinimum bias collisions are a mixture of hard processes (perturbative QCD) and soft\nprocesses (non-perturbative QCD) and are, hence, very difficult to simulate. Min-bias collisions\ncontain soft \"beam-beam remnants\", hard QCD 2-to-2 parton-parton scattering, and multiple\nparton interactions (soft & hard). To correctly simulate min-bias collisions one must have the\ncorrect mixture of hard and soft processes together with a good model of the multiple-parton\ninteractions. The first model that came close to correctly modeling min-bias collisions at CDF\nwas PYTHIA Tune A. Tune A was not tuned to fit min-bias collisions. It was tuned to fit the\nactivity in the \"underlying event\" in high transverse momentum jet production [3]. However,\nPYTHIA uses the same pT cut-off for the primary hard 2-to-2 parton-parton scattering and for\nadditional multiple parton interactions. Hence, fixing the amount of multiple parton interactions\n(i.e. setting the pT cut-off) allows one to run the hard 2-to-2 parton-parton scattering all the way\ndown to pT(hard) = 0 without hitting a divergence. For PYTHIA the amount of hard scattering in\nmin-bias is, therefore, related to the activity of the \"underlying event\" in hard scattering\nprocesses. Neither HERWIG (without MPI) or HERWIG (with JIMMY MPI) can be used to\ndescribe \"min-bias\" events since they diverge as pT(hard) goes to zero.\nFig. 3.10 shows the new CDF \"min-bias\" data presented at this conference by Niccolo' Moggi\n[9]. The data are corrected to the particle level at 1.96 TeV and show the average pT of charged\nparticles versus the multiplicity for charged particles with pT > 0.4 GeV/c and |K| < 1. The data\nare compared with PYTHIA Tune A, the PYTHIA ATLAS tune, and PYTHIA Tune A without\nMPI (pyAnoMPI). This is an important observable. The rate of change of <pT> versus charged\nmultiplicity is a measure of the amount of hard versus soft processes contributing to min-bias\ncollisions and it is sensitive to the modeling of the multiple-parton interactions [10]. If only the\nsoft \"beam-beam\" remnants contributed to min-bias collisions then <pT> would not depend on\ncharged multiplicity. If one has two processes contributing, one soft (\"beam-beam remnants\")\nand one hard (hard 2-to-2 parton-parton scattering), then demanding large multiplicity will\npreferentially select the hard process and lead to a high <pT>. However, we see that with only\nthese two processes <pT> increases much too rapidly as a function of multiplicity (see\npyAnoMPI). Multiple-parton interactions provides another mechanism for producing large\nMPI08\n\n27\n\n\fmultiplicities that are harder than the \"beam-beam remnants\", but not as hard as the primary 2to-2 hard scattering. PYTHIA Tune A gives a fairly good description of the <pT> versus\nmultiplicity, although not perfect. PYTHIA Tune A does a better job describing the data than\nthe ATLAS tune. Both Tune A and the ATLAS tune include multiple-parton interactions, but\nwith different choices for the color connections [11].\nAverage PT versus Nchg\n\nAverage PT (GeV/c)\n\n1.4\n\nCDF Run 2 Preliminary\ndata corrected\ngenerator level theory\n\n1.2\n\nMin-Bias\n1.96 TeV\n\npyA\n\npyAnoMPI\n\n1.0\n\nATLAS\n\n0.8\nCharged Particles (|K|<1.0, PT>0.4 GeV/c)\n\n0.6\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\nNumber of Charged Particles\n\nAverage PT versus Nchg\n\nAverage PT (GeV/c)\n\n2.5\n\nCDF Run 2 Preliminary\ndata corrected\ngenerator level theory\n\n2.0\n\nHW\npyAW\n\n\"Drell-Yan Production\"\n70 < M(pair) < 110 GeV\n\n1.5\nJIM\n\n1.0\nATLAS\n\nCharged Particles (|K|<1.0, PT>0.5 GeV/c)\nexcluding the lepton-pair\n\n0.5\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nNumber of Charged Particles\n\nPT(Z-Boson) versus Nchg\n\nAverage PT(Z) (GeV/c)\n\n80\n\nCDF Run 2 Preliminary\ndata corrected\ngenerator level theory\n\n60\n\npyAW\nHW\n\n\"Drell-Yan Production\"\n70 < M(pair) < 110 GeV\n\n40\nJIM\n\n20\nATLAS\n\nCharged Particles (|K|<1.0, PT>0.5 GeV/c)\nexcluding the lepton-pair\n\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\nNumber of Charged Particles\n\nFig. 3.10.

The data are compared with\nPYTHIA Tune AW, the PYTHIA ATLAS tune, HERWIG (without MPI), and HERWIG (with JIMMY MPI). (bottom)\nComparison of the average pT of charged particles versus the charged multiplicity for \"Min-Bias\" events from Ref. 14 with the\n\"Z-boson\" events with pT(Z) < 10 GeV/c from this analysis. The \"Min-Bias\" data require pT > 0.4 GeV/c and are compared with\nPYTHIA Tune A, while the \"Z-boson\" data require pT > 0.5 GeV/c and are compared with PYTHIA Tune AW.\n\nFig. 3.11 shows the data at 1.96 TeV on the average pT of charged particles versus the\nmultiplicity for charged particles with pT > 0.5 GeV/c and |K| < 1 for \"Z-boson\" events in which\npT(Z) < 10 GeV/c. We see that <pT> still increases as the multiplicity increases although not as\nfast. If we require pT(Z) < 10 GeV/c, then HERWIG (without MPI) predicts that the <pT>\ndecreases slightly as the multiplicity increases. This is because without MPI and without the\nhigh pT \"away-side\" jet which is suppressed by requiring low pT(Z), large multiplicities come\nfrom events with a lot of initial-state radiation and the particles coming from initial-state\nradiation are \"soft\". PYTHIA Tune AW describes the behavior of <pT> versus the multiplicity\nfairly well even when we select pT(Z) < 10 GeV/c.\nFig. 3.11 also shows a comparison of the average pT of charged particles versus the charged\nmultiplicity for \"min-bias\" events [9] with the \"Z-boson\" events with pT(Z) < 10 GeV/c. There\nis no reason for the \"min-bias\" data to agree with the \"Z-boson\" events with pT(Z) < 10 GeV/c.\nHowever, they are remarkably similar and described fairly well by PYTHIA Tune A and Tune\n\nMPI08\n\n29\n\n\fAW, respectively. This strongly suggests that MPI are playing an important role in both these\nprocesses.\n\n4. Summary & Conclusions\nObservables that are sensitive to the \"underlying event\" in high transverse momentum jet\nproduction (i.e. \"leading jet\" events) and Drell-Yan lepton pair production in the mass region of\nthe Z-boson (i.e. \"Z-boson\" events) have been presented and compared with several QCD\nMonte-Carlo model tunes. The data are corrected to the particle level and compared with the\nMonte-Carlo models at the particle level (i.e. generator level). The \"underlying event\" is similar\nfor \"leading jet\" and \"Z-boson\" events as one would expect. The goal of the CDF analysis is to\nprovide data that can be used to tune and improve the QCD Monte-Carlo models of the\n\"underlying event\" that are used to simulate hadron-hadron collisions. It is important to tune the\nnew QCD Monte-Carlo MPI models [10, 11] so that we can begin to use them in data analysis. I\nbelieve once the new QCD Monte-Carlo models have been tuned that they will describe the data\nbetter than the old Pythia 6.2 tunes (see the talks by Peter Skands and Hendrik Hoeth as this\nconference).\nPYTHIA Tune A and Tune AW do a good job in describing the CDF data on the\n\"underlying event\" observables for \"leading jet\" and \"Z-boson\" events, respectively, although\nthe agreement between theory and data is not perfect. The \"leading jet\" data show slightly more\nactivity in the \"underlying event\" than PYTHIA Tune A. PYTHIA Tune AW is essentially\nidentical to Tune A for \"leading jet\" events. All the tunes with MPI agree better than HERWIG\nwithout MPI. This is especially true in the \"toward\" region in \"Z-boson\" production. Adding\nJIMMY MPI to HERWIG greatly improves the agreement with data, but HERWIG with JIMMY\nMPI produces a charged particle pT spectra that is considerably \"softer\" than the data. The\nPYTHIA ATLAS tune also produces a charged particle pT spectra that is considerably \"softer\"\nthan the data.\nThe behavior of the average charged particle pT versus the charged particle multiplicity is\nan important observable. The rate of change of <pT> versus charged multiplicity is a measure of\nthe amount of hard versus soft processes contributing and it is sensitive the modeling of the\nmultiple-parton interactions. PYTHIA Tune A and Tune AW do a good job in describing the\ndata on <pT> versus multiplicity for \"min-bias\" and \"Z-boson\" events, respectively, although\nagain the agreement between theory and data is not perfect. The behavior of <pT> versus\nmultiplicity is remarkable similar for \"min-bias\" events and \"Z-boson\" events with pT(Z) < 10\nGeV/c suggesting that MPI are playing an important role in both these processes.\nModels with multiple-parton interactions like PYTHIA Tune DWT predict that the\n\"underlying event\" will become much more active (with larger <pT>) at the LHC. For HERWIG\n(without MPI) the \"toward\" region of \"Z-boson\" production does not change much in going\nfrom the Tevatron to the LHC. It is important to measure the \"underlying event\" observables\npresented here as soon as possible at the LHC. We will learn a lot about MPI by comparing the\nTevatron results with the early LHC measurements.\n\n30\n\nMPI08\n\n\fReferences and Footnotes\n[1] T. Sjostrand, Phys. Lett. 157B, 321 (1985); M.

Emphasis will be given to the generator validation and\nthe Monte Carlo set-up for interpreting the first LHC data.\n1 Introduction and desiderata\nThe year 2009 is crucial for the Monte Carlo (MC) production at the LHC experiments, that will\nallow interpreting the first data. The experiments are preparing their event generation strategies\nand are producing large-scale samples of events for training tools and analyses.\nIn a modern generation setup for physics at the LHC there are certain requirements that need to\nbe fulfilled. They can be summarised as follows:\n\u2022 an event generator with a description of the hard scattering process with a matrix element\n(ME) calculation at the highest possible QCD order\n\u2022 the possibility of interfacing, directly or via intermediate parton level files, to generic tools\nused for the parton showering (PS) and for parton hadronisation. The most known, and\nlargely used, are PYTHIA [1] and HERWIG [2]\n\u2022 the presence of models for the description of the underlying event (UE), representing all\nwhat is in the event except the primary interaction. PYTHIA and HERWIG already present\nmodels for this task\n\u2022 a coverage, as large as possible, of Standard Model (SM) and Beyond the Standard Model\n(BSM) processes, with a good flexibility for implementing new physics models in the event\ngeneration\n\u2022 standard output formatting of parton level files, in particular the possibility of outputting\nevents in the Les Houches format [3]\nThe current article should not be intended as a review of generators, but rather a picture of\nthe current MC set-up chosen by ATLAS and CMS, and of the current validation activities on this\nsubject. I will focus in what follows on generic SM and BSM physics from pp collisions, without\ndiscussing generators for heavy ions studies, or dedicated tools for new physics signatures (like\nblack holes generators) or dedicated detector studies (like generator of cosmics, beam halo or\nbeam-gas intercations). These generators remain however essential for the physics programme\nof ATLAS and CMS.\n\n32\n\nMPI08\n\n\f2 Generators for LHC physics\n2.1\n\nEvent generators\n\nBoth the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations try to use as many event generators as reasonable. The\nreference generic purpose event generators for SM and BSM physics and beyond are PYTHIA,\nHERWIG and SHERPA. The first two, whose original version is written in FORTRAN, are now\nalso used in their C++ versions (PYTHIA8, HERWIG++), that will be the only ones maintained\nin the long term. The main common feature of all generic purpose generators is that they provide\na fully hadronised event to be passed directly to the detector simulation. All of them implement models for the description of the radiation, fragmentation and the underlying event. The\nmodels in PYTHIA and HERWIG have been extensively tuned to LEP, SLD and Tevatron data\nfor what concerns PS-fragmentation [4] and UE [5]. If PYTHIA and HERWIG include LO descriptions of very many SM and BSM processes, in some cases with the additional corrections\nto PS for a description of the first QCD emission at NLO, SHERPA also include the possibility\nof matching PS with ME at higher leading order, for both SM and BSM processes. General\ninterest decay/correction tools, interfacable to all kind of general purpose event generators, are\ntypically used in both Collaborations. Most noticable ones are TAUOLA, for \u03c4 decays [6], EvtGen, for hadron decays [7], extensively tuned at the Tevatron and at B-factories, and PHOTOS,\nfor including real QED corrections [6].\nIf generic purpose event generators represent the 'work-horses' for the MC productions\nat the LHC, there has been an enormous progress in the last years on implementing ME descriptions of beyond-leading order QCD processes in event generators. This allows to improve\nthe predicitons for observables sensitive to hard QCD emission (multi jet final states, typically).\nThis has been achieved either with techniques matching higher leading order (HLO) ME with PS\n(examples are given by ALPGEN [8], MadGraph [9], SHERPA [10], HELAC [11]), and by nextto-leading order (NLO) generators (like MC@NLO [12] and POWHEG [13]). The fundamental\ndifference between the two categories of calculations is that the HLO maintains a precision that\nis typically LO, but more correctly predicts shapes of differential distributions sensitive to real\nQCD emission, even at several orders beyond the leading, whereas NLO calculations are correct\nin shape and normalisation at NLO for inclusive variables, but they count on PS for all extra\nemission beyond the first.\nBoth CMS and ATLAS have interest in all those generators, and there is already an extensive\nexperience in their use in the collaborations. MadGraph, ALPGEN and MC@NLO are indeed\nreferences in the current Monte Carlo productions for physics. The event generators in the HLO\nand NLO categories remain parton level event generators, and need therefore to be interfaced\nto PS and hadronisation for use in the experiments. Most of them provide direct interfaces to\nPYTHIA, or parton level output in the standard Les Houches Accord format [3], that can be\ninput to any hadroniser. Noticeable exception is MC@NLO, directly built on top of HERWIG.\nThe present list of generators does not exhaust what experiments have used and are using\nfor physics results. Some of them represent useful crosschecks, like AcerMC [14] or TopRex [15]\nfor top physics, or are in place for the description of particular processes, like SingleTop [16] for\nsingle top physics or Phantom [17] for the description of full six fermion processes at LO.\n\nMPI08\n\n33\n\n\f2.2\n\nGenerators tuning and set-up\n\nA full event generation often implies approximations by use of models, whose parameters need\ntypically to be tuned to data. Examples are the parton showering, fragmentation, the description\nof the proton PDFs, the modelisation of the underlying event. Without entering a detailed explanation of each topic, I will briefly review the current settings chosen by ATLAS and CMS.\nThe first essential ingredient, since protons are composite objects, is to describe the probability of the initial state at the hard process scale Q2 with a certain fraction x of the total proton\nmomentum. Since the Q2 evolution can be calculated perturbatively in the framework of QCD,\nPDFs are fitted to a set of heterogeneous data from DIS, Drell-Yan and jet data. Both Collaborations are currently using the LO CTEQ6L1 fit [18] with NLO PDF used only for NLO ME\ncalculations. Errors from the fits, currently only available for NLO fits, are then propagated to\nthe final observables. The scheme adopted at present is likely to change since no one of the\ngenerator used is purely LO. There is more and more consensus, in the theory community, for\nusing modified leading order PDFs [19] for all LO calculations, or calculations including LO ME\ncorrections. Modified PDFs are, essentially, LO PDF that relax the partonic momentum sum rule\nto get predictions artificially closer to NLO.\nFrom parton level four-momenta configurations, initial and final state QCD and QED radiation are produced, via parton showering algorithms down to a certain energy scale: from that\nscale on fragmentation transforms coloured partons to colourless hadrons according to specific\nmodels. Radiation parameters are typically fitted together with the fragmentation parameters,\nand for the moment both ATLAS and CMS make use of fits from LEP/SLD [4, 20], assuming\njet universality. The fragmentation functions chosen for heavy quark fragmentation are the ones\nbetter describing LEP/SLD data, namely Bowler [21] and Peterson [22]. With data available,\nthose fits will have to be re-made at the LHC, taking care of the additional complication that\ninitial state radiation at hadron machines contributes to the description of the underlying event\nas well, so it will be essential to disentangle the two. Moreover, with the use of modern ME-PS\nmatching, tunings of the PS part will have a new meaning with respect to previous tunings.\nThe underlying event corresponds to what else is present in an event, except the hardest interaction. Multiple parton interaction models turn out to be particularly adequate to describe this\nkind of physics. Examples of these models are implemented in the general purpose simulation\nprograms PYTHIA, HERWIG/JIMMY [23], and SHERPA. Huge progress in the phenomenological study of the underlying event in jet events have been achieved by CDF [5] using, for\nthe tuning of the models, the multiplicity and transverse momentum spectra of charged tracks\nin different regions in the azimuth-pseudorapidity space, defined with respect to the direction of\nthe leading jet. The main problem of extrapolating the predictions of the multiple interactions\nmodels to the LHC is that some of the parameters are explicitly energy dependent. Some of the\ntunes, used by ATLAS and CMS [24, 25], have put enphasis in the energy extrapolation by also\nfitting lower energy data. The results are shown in figure 1, where the predictions of JIMMY and\nPYTHIA are extrapolated to the LHC energy for the average number of charged tracks and the\naverage pT sum of tracks in the transverse region (with respect to the leading jet in the event) as\na function of the transverse momentum of the leading jet in the event. The curves are compared\nto CDF data, and it is clear that the extrapolation to CMS energies implies very different shapes\ncompared to Tevatron. Moreover, the extrapolated predictions can differ widely according to the\n34\n\nMPI08\n\n\fFig. 1: Average number of charged tracks (left) and average track pT sum in the transverse region (right) as a function\nof the transverse momentum of the leading jet in the event. The extrapolated predictions at the LHC are compared to\nCDF data.\n\nmodel used, therefore it will be mandatory to use LHC data themselves to validate them.\n3 Generator validation\nThe validation of generators prediction in an experimental framework is an invaluable exercise to\ngain confidence in the tools being used and to learn about the difference in the physics contents\nbetween generators. A few important examples are presented in this section.\n3.1\n\nMultiple parton interactions\n\nThe presence of multiple parton interactions, i.e. the possibility of having multiple parton-parton\ninteractions overlapping in the same event, has been established already at the Tevatron, as illustrated in figure 2. The left part of the figure shows, for \u03b3+3jets events, the azimuthal distance\nbetween the transverse momentum vectors formed by the photon and the most back-to-back jet,\nand by the other two jets. The MPI component is expected to have a flat behaviour in this variable, and the figure clearly shows that the CDF data can not be described without accounting\nfor it. The most recent PYTHIA version includes MPI interleaved to PS, and it is essential to\nvalidate this tool in the experimental framework.\nThe right-hand part of figure 2 shows a preliminary study by CMS where the prediction of\nPYTHIA8 with MPI for the same azimuthal variable are compared with PYTHIA6 and HERWIG with the most uptodate UE tune [26, 27], and the same generators without the inclusion of\nMPI. The plot shows that the newest version of PYTHIA agrees with the default tuned one, and\nthat there are important discrepancies between HERWIG (+JIMMY) and PYTHIA. One more\ntime it is shown that MPI effects are non negligible and should be accounted for.\nMPI08\n\n35\n\n\fFig. 2: Azimuthal distance between \u03b3+j and j+j systems in \u03b3+jets events at CDF, comparing data with MC, with or\nwithout MPI component (left).Validation of PYTHIA8 with MPI in CMS (right).\n\n3.2\n\nHard QCD emission in boson production\n\nRecent developments in ME generators allow to describe QCD radiation much more accurately.\nIt is instructive to compare, for high pT physics, the prediction of those calculations with respect\nto LO ones for observables that are sensitive to (gluon) radiation. One of such comparison comes\nfrom W+jets production. The ATLAS Collaboration compared the transverse momentum of\nthe first four highest pT jets in the event for ALPGEN and PYTHIA. The results are shown in\nfigure 3, and large difference are observed in the high momentum tails, as expected by a more\naccurate ME description. Also, the total number of high pT jets increases very significantly going\nfrom a pure LO description to a higher order one with matching to PS.\nOne important question for the analyses is about the residual uncertainty on total and\ndifferential cross-sections when going to high jet multiplicity in the final state. This question\naddresses the problem of quantifying the confidence on the description of W boson production\nas background to more complex process like top-pair production, where an associated many-jets\nproduction is necessary. To assess this, ATLAS have calculated the predicted cross-sections for\nall jet multiplicities in W+jets with\n\ufffd ALPGEN by varying both the matching scale (from 10 to\n40 GeV) and the minimum \u2206R ( \u2206\u03b7 2 + \u2206\u03c62 ) that defines a parton (from 0.3 to 0.7). The\nresult, confirming that the relative importance of the cross-sections at a fixed parton multiplicity\nvaries according to the choice, shows that also the total cross-section, i.e. the sum of all fixed\nmultiplicities contributions, varies quite significantly in the different scenarios, up to around\na factor 50%. This is shown in fig. 4, left, where the reconstructed top mass for candidate\nsemileptonic events in signal and W+jets background samples is shown for two choices of the\nmatching scale, 20 and 40 GeV, respectively, at the same parton separation definition of \u2206R = 0.7.\nThe event selection is kept very simple with one reconstructed charged electron or muon with\n36\n\nMPI08\n\n\fFig. 3: Transverse momentum of the first four highest p T jets in W+jets events.\n\npT > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5, missing transverse energy greater than 20 GeV, and at least four\nreconstructed jets, each with transverse energy of at least 20 GeV and for three of them larger\nthan 40 GeV. Though the shape of the signal is unchanged, the W+jets background scales by a\nfactor 1.5. This reflects an uncertainty of the matching procedure itself that grows as the final\nparton multiplicity gets higher. Though the matching itself can be constrained using data at the\nLHC, present comparisons data-MC made at the Tevatron still show an insufficient statistics to\nconstrain such predictions at the LHC. This is shown in fig. 4, right, where the CDF collaboration\nshows the ratio between data and theory for the inclusive jet multiplicity in W events [28]. As\ncan be seen, the error bands of the matching codes get bigger at high multiplicity and current\ndata is not enough to constrain them significantly.\n3.3\n\nHard QCD emission in top production\n\nA thourough test of the different description of QCD was also made by the CMS Collaboration\nin the case of top-pair production: differences may manifest themselves in distortions of the top\nquark angular distributions and transverse variables.\nThe most spectacular effect is in the transverse momentum of the radiation itself, which equals\nthe transverse momentum of the tt\u0304 system recoiling against it: this is what is shown in fig. 5,\nMPI08\n\n37\n\n\fFig. 4: Reconstructed top mass in ATLAS for tt\u0304 signal and W+jets background (left) and ratio between data and\ndifferent theory predictions for the inclusive jet multiplicity in W events at the Tevatron (right).\n\nFig. 5: Transverse momentum of the tt\u0304 system (left), azimuthal angle between the two tops (right). All distributions\nare normalised to unity.\n\nleft, for two leading order generations by MadGraph and TopRex (with PS) in comparison to\nthe ME-PS matching scheme in MadGraph. The contributions to a fixed ME order, ie tt+0jets,\ntt+1jets, tt+2jets and tt+3jets, are explictly indicated. On the right hand side of the same figure the\ncorresponding distribution of the azimuthal difference between the two tops is also shown. The\ncentre of mass energy is 14 TeV, and it is important to notice that the input parameters settings\n(cuts, scales, PDFs) of the various generators shown in the figure are kept as uniform as possible\nto avoid any possible bias in the comparison. From the picture it is evident that gluon production\nvia ME predicts a much harder transverse spectrum. The difference in shape reaches orders of\nmagnitude in the ratio at very high values of pT . The increased activity in hard gluon emission\nfor the ME-PS matched case also explains a generally decreased azimuthal distance between the\ntwo top quarks, which tend to be closer to each other. The distributions confirm the fact that\nhaving more ME radiation tends to increase the event transverse activity. The predicted average\npT of the radiation by MadGraph is 62 GeV/c (72 GeV/c with ALPGEN), with a 40% probability\nof having more than 50 GeV/c as gluon pT in tt\u0304 events. This large gluon activity will certainly\nhave an impact in the capability of correctly reconstructing top quark events at the LHC, and\ncorrectly interpreting radiation as a background for new physics searches.\nAn important validation step comes from the comparison of the predictions from different\n38\n\nMPI08\n\n\fFig. 6: Transverse momentum of the tt\u0304 system (left), azimuthal angle between the two tops (right). All distributions\nare normalised to unity.\n\nME-PS matched codes. Fig. 6 shows the same distributions of fig. 5, but for ALPGEN and\nMadGraph with ME-PS matching, respectively. For the pT of the tt\u0304 system the individual parton\nmultiplicity components are also shown. The agreement is more than acceptable, and remarkable\nfor the azimuthal difference between the top quarks. Especially in the tails of the distributions,\ncorresponding to high radiation conditions, the disagreement goes from orders of magnitude of\nfig. 5, to a maximum discrepancy of 50%. To properly appreciate the difference between the\ntwo predictions one should, however, account for the theory errors on them. Scale and PDF\ndependencies, PS tuning uncertainties could very well account for any residual difference in the\ntails.\nAnother important test for the description of radiation in the top-pair production comes\nfrom the comparison of matched ME-PS calculations to NLO predictions. This study was made\nby comparing the previous predictions to MC@NLO. A general very good agreement was found\nin all distributions, including the transverse ones. In fig. 7 the pT of the tt\u0304 system and the pT\nof the top are shown for ALPGEN, MadGraph and MC@NLO. As can be appreciated from the\nfigure, it is particularly relevant the fact that the tails of the radiation are very well reproduced.\nThe discrepancy in the very soft region is mostly due to the different showering, since MC@NLO\nis only interfaced to HERWIG whereas the other predictions use PYTHIA as tool for PS and\nfragmentation.\n4 Summary and outlook: towards data\nThe LHC experiments are preparing their MC production to be ready for the interpretation of\nthe imminent data. There are a few important lessons that have been learned from previous\nexperiments and via the generator validation efforts in ATLAS and CMS, that help planning a\nwinning generation strategy:\n\u2022 make sure to use the best available tools for the description of the signal and the main\nbackgrounds. For high jet multiplicity signals it is of utmost importance to include higher\nQCD corrections with now available ME generators.\n\nMPI08\n\n39\n\n\fFig. 7: Transverse momentum of the tt\u0304 system (left), transverse momentum of the top quark (right). All distributions\nare normalised to unity.\n\n\u2022 plan a very accurate MC tuning by using LHC data. All event generators use models for\nPS, fragmentation and UE/MPI, that need to be tuned. Moreover, interfacing external NLO\nor HLO generators to more standard PS tools opens new scenarios for the MC tunings.

We present a list\nof fast and infrared and collinear safe algorithms, and also describe\nnew tools like jet areas. We show how these techniques can be applied\nto the study of underlying event or, more generally, of any background\nwhich can be considered distributed in a sufficiently uniform way.\n1\n\nRecent Developments in Jet Clustering\n\nThe final state of a high energy hadronic collision is inherently extremely complicated. Hundreds\nor even thousands of particles will be recorded by detectors at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC),\nmaking the task of reconstructing the original (simpler) hard event very difficult. This large\nnumber of particles is the product of a number of branchings and decays which follow the initial\nproduction of a handful of partons. Usually only a limited number of stages of this production\nprocess can be meaningfully described in quantitative terms, for instance by perturbation theory\nin QCD. This is why, in order to compare theory and data, the latter must first be simplified down\nto the level described by the theory.\nJet clustering algorithms offer precisely this possibility of creating calculable observables\nfrom many final-state particles. This is done by clustering them into jets via a well specified\nalgorithm, which usually contains one or more parameters, the most important of them being\na \"radius\" R which controls the extension of the jet in the rapidity-azimuth plane. One can\nalso choose a recombination scheme, which controls how partons' (or jets') four-momenta are\ncombined. The choice of a jet algorithm, its parameters and the recombination scheme is called a\njet definition [1], and must be specified in full (together with the initial particles sample) in order\nfor the process\n{particles}\n\njet definition\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nto be fully reproducible and the final jets to be the same.\n\n{jets}\n\n(1)\n\nWhile (almost) any jet definition can produce sensible observables, not all of them will\nproduce one which is calculable in perturbation theory. For this to be true, the jet algorithm\nmust be infrared and collinear safe (IRC safe) [2], meaning that actions producing configurations\nthat lead to divergences in perturbation theory, namely the emission of a very soft particle or a\ncollinear splitting of a particle into two) must not produce any change in the jets returned by the\nalgorithm.\nThe importance for jet algorithms to be IRC safe had been recognized as early as 1990 in\nthe 'Snowmass accord' [3], together with the need for them to be easily applicable both on the\n42\n\nMPI08\n\n\fJet algorithm\nkt [5, 6]\nCambridge/Aachen [7, 8]\nanti-kt [10]\nSISCone [9]\n\nType of algorithm, (distance measure)\n2 , k 2 )\u2206R2 /R2\nSR, dij = min(kti\ntj\nij\n2 /R2\nSR, dij = \u2206Rij\n\u22122 \u22122\n2 /R2\nSR, dij = min(kti\n, ktj )\u2206Rij\nseedless iterative cone with split-merge\n\nalgorithmic complexity\nN ln N\nN ln N\nN 3/2\nN 2 ln N\n\nTable 1: List of some of the IRC safe algorithms available in FastJet.

However, many of the implementations of jet clustering\nalgorithms used in the following decade and a half failed to provide these characteristics: conetype algorithms were typically infrared or collinear unsafe beyond the two or three particle level\n(see [1] for a review), whereas recombination-type algorithms were usually considered too slow\nto be usable at the experimental level in hadronic collisions.\nThis deadlock was finally broken by two papers, one in in 2005 [4], which made sequential recombination type clustering algorithms like kt [5, 6] and Cambridge/Aachen [7, 8]\nfast, and one in 2007, which introduced SISCone [9], a cone-type algorithm which is infrared\nand collinear safe. A third paper introduced, in 2008, the anti-kt algorithm [10], a fast, IRC\nsafe recombination-type algorithm which however behaves, for many practical purposes, like a\nnearly-perfect cone. This set of algorithms (see Table 1), all available through the FastJet\npackage [11], allows one to replace most of the unsafe algorithms still in use with fast and IRC\nsafe ones, while retaining their main characteristics (for instance, the MidPoint and the ATLAS\ncone could be replaced by SISCone, and the CMS cone could be replaced by anti-kt ).\n2\n\nJet Areas\n\nA by-product of the speed and the infrared safety of the new algorithms (or new implementations\nof older algorithms) was found to be the possibility to define in a practical way the area of a jet,\nwhich measures its susceptibility to be contaminated by a uniformly distributed background of\nsoft particles in a given event.\nIn their most modest incarnation, jet areas can be used to visualize the outline of the jets\nreturned by an algorithm so as to appreciate, for instance, if it returns regular (\"conical\") jets or\nrather ragged ones. An example is given in Fig. 1.\nJet areas are amenable, to some extent, to analytic treatments [12], or can be measured\nnumerically with the tools provided by FastJet. These analyses disprove the common assumption that all cone-type algorithms have areas equal to \u03c0R2 . In fact, depending on exactly\nwhich type of cone algorithm one considers, its areas can differ, even substantially so, from this\nnaive estimate: for instance, the area of a SISCone jet made of a single hard particle immersed in\na background of many soft particles is \u03c0R2 /4 (this little catchment area can explain why other\niterative cone algorithms with a split-merge step, like the MidPoint algorithm in use at CDF,\nhave often been seen to fare 'well' in noisy environments). One can analyse next the kt and the\nCambridge/Aachen algorithms, and see that their single-hard-particle areas turn out to be roughly\nMPI08\n\n43\n\n\fFig. 1: Typical jet outlines returned by four different IRC safe jet clustering algorithms. From [10].\n\n0.81\u03c0R2 . Finally, this area for the anti-kt algorithm is instead exactly \u03c0R2 . This fact, together\nwith its regular contours shown in Fig. 1, explains why it is usually considered to behave like a\n'perfect cone'.\nJet areas also allow one to use some jet algorithms as tools to measure the level of a\nsufficiently uniform background which accompanies harder events. This can be accomplished\nby following the procedure outlined in [13]: for each event, all particles are clustered into jets\nusing either the kt or the Cambridge/Aachen algorithms, and the transverse momentum pt,j and\nthe area Aj of each jet are calculated. One observes that a few hard jets have large values of\ntransverse momentum divided by area, whereas most of the other, softer jets have smaller (and\nsimilar) values of this ratio. The background level \u03c1, transverse momentum per unit area in the\nrapidity-azimuth plane, is then obtained as\n\u03c1 = median\n\n\ufffd\n\npt,j\nAj\n\n\ufffd\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\nj\u2208R\n\nThe range R should be the largest possible region of the rapidity-azimuth plane over which the\nbackground is expected to be constant.\nThe operation of taking the median of the {pt,j /Aj } distribution is, to some extent, arbitrary. It has been found to give sensible results, provided that the range R contains sufficiently\nmany soft background jets \u2013 at least about ten (twenty) of them, if only one (two) harder jets are\nalso present in R, are usually enough [14].\n44\n\nMPI08\n\n\f5\n\n10 hard, 100 soft\nno hard, 100 soft\n\nkt algorithm, |y| < 4\n\nptsoft = 1 GeV, pthard = 100 GeV\n\n\u03c1 (GeV)\n\n4\n\n3\nnsoft*ptsoft/Areatot\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nR\n\nFig. 2: Determination of the background level \u03c1 of a toy-model random underlying event, as a function of the radius\nparameter R. Each point is the result of averaging over many different realizations. The parameters have been adjusted\nto roughly reproduce the situation expected at the LHC.\n\n3\n\nUnderlying Event Studies\n\nTo a certain extent, and within certain limits, the background to a hard collision created by the\nsoft particles of the underlying event (EU) can be considered fairly uniform. It becomes then\namenable to be studied with the technique introduced in the previous Section. This constitutes\nan alternative to the usual and widespread approach (see for instance [15, 16]) of triggering on a\nleading jet, and selecting the two regions in the azimuth space which are transverse to its direction\nand to that of the recoil jet. These two regions are considered to be little affected by hard radiation\n(in the least energetic of them it is expected to be suppressed by at least two powers of \u03b1s ), and\ntherefore one can expect to be able to measure the UE level there.\nThis way of selecting the UE can be considered a topological one: particles (or jets) are\nclassified as belonging to the UE or not as a result of their position. On the other hand, the\nmedian procedure described in the previous Section can be thought of as a dynamical selection:\nno a priori hypotheses are made and, in a way that changes from one event to another, a jet is\nautomatically classified as belonging to the hard event or to the background as a result of its characteristics (namely the value of the pt,j /Aj ratio). One can further show that this selection pushes\nthe possible contamination from perturbative radiation to very large powers of \u03b1s : for a range R\ndefined by |y| < ymax , perturbative contamination will only start at order n \ufffd 3ymax /R2 [13].\nThis gives n \u223c 24 for ymax = 2 and R = 0.5, suggesting that the perturbative contribution is\nminimal.\nA sensible criticism of this procedure is that the UE distribution is not necessarily uniform,\nMPI08\n\n45\n\n\f40\n\n7\n1 Pythia event (with UE)\n\n1 Pythia event (+ c. 20 min.bias)\n\n35\n\nLHC dijet (pt c. 200 GeV)\n\nLHC dijet (pt c. 100 GeV)\n\n30\n\n5\n\n!!\"!\" [GeV]\n\n!UE !\"\"UE [GeV]\n\n6\n\n4\n3\n2\n\n25\n20\n15\n10\n\n1\n\n5\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\nR\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\nR\n\nFig. 3: Determination of the background level \u03c1 in realistic dijet events at the LHC, with (right) and without (left)\npileup. Preliminary results.\n\nand may for instance vary as a function of rapidity. A way around this is then to choose smaller\nranges, located at different rapidity values, and repeat the \u03c1 determination in each of them. Of\ncourse care will have to be taken that the chosen ranges remain large enough to satisfy the criterion on the number of soft jets versus hard ones given in the previous Section: for instance, a\nrange one unit of rapidity large can be expected to contain roughly 2\u03c0/(0.55\u03c0R2 ) \u223c 15 soft jets\nfor R = 0.5, which makes it marginally apt to the task1 .\nA final word should be spent on which values of the radius parameter R can be considered\nappropriate for this analysis. Roughly speaking, R should be large enough for the number of\n'real' jets (i.e. containing real particles) to be at last larger than the number of 'empty jets'\n(regions of the rapidity-azimuth plane void of particles, and not occupied by any 'real' jet). It\nshould also be small enough to avoid having too many jets containing too many hard particles.\nAnalytical estimates [13] and empirical evidence show that for UE estimation in typical LHC\nconditions one can expect values of the order of 0.5 \u2013 0.6 to be appropriate. Much smaller values\nwill return \u03c1 \ufffd 0, while larger values will tend to return progressively larger values of \u03c1, as a\nresult of the increasing contamination from the hard jets. Fig. 2 shows results obtained with a\nt\ntoy model where 100 soft particles with psof\n\ufffd 1 GeV are generated in a |y| < 4 region. Ten\nT\nhard\nhard particles, with pT\n\ufffd 100 GeV, can be additionally generated in the same region. One\nobserves how, after a threshold value for R, \u03c1 is estimated correctly for the soft-only case, while\nwhen hard particles are present they increasingly contaminate the estimate of the background.\nThe same analysis can be performed on more realistic events, generated by Monte Carlo\nsimulations. Fig. 3 shows the determination of \u03c1 in a simulated dijet event at the LHC, with\nand without pileup. In both cases the general structure of the toy-model in Fig. 2 can be seen,\nthough it is worth noting that in the UE case (left plot) the slope can vary significantly from event\nto event, and also according to the Monte Carlo tune used [14]. The larger particle density (and\nprobably higher uniformity) of the pileup case allows for an easier and more stable determination.\nOnce a procedure for determining \u03c1 is available, one can think of many different appli1\nIts performance can be improved by removing the hardest jets it contains from the {pt,j /Aj } list before taking\nthe median [14].\n\n46\n\nMPI08\n\n\fHerwig+Jimmy (an Atlas tune)\nPythia DW\nPythia DWT\n\n0.5\n\ndn/d!

Preliminary results.\n\ncations. One possibility is of course to tune Monte Carlo models to real data by comparing\nrho distributions, correlations, etc. A preliminary example is given in fig. 4, where studying\nthe distribution of \u03c1 can be seen to allow one to discriminate between UE models which would\notherwise give similar values for the average contribution \ufffd\u03c1\ufffd. More extensive studies are in\nprogress [14].\nYet another use of measured \u03c1 values is the subtraction of the background from the transverse momentum of hard jets. Ref. [13] proposed to correct the four-momentum p\u03bcj of the jet\nj by an amount proportional to \u03c1 and to the area of the jet itself (the susceptibility of the jet to\ncontamination):\npsub\n(3)\n\u03bcj = p\u03bcj \u2212 \u03c1A\u03bcj\n\nwhere A\u03bcj is a four-dimensional generalization of the concept of jet area, normalized in such a\nway that its transverse component coincides, for small jets, with the scalar area Aj [12]. One\ncan show [13, 17] that such subtraction of the underlying event can improve in a non-negligible\nway the reconstruction of mass peaks even at very large energy scales. A similar procedure is\nalso being considered [18] for heavy ion collisions, where the background can contribute a huge\ncontamination, even larger than the transverse momentum of the hard jet itself (partly because\nof this, one usually speaks of 'jet reconstruction' in this context, rather than just 'subtraction').\nInitial versions of this technique have already been employed at the experimental level by the\nSTAR Collaboration at RHIC in [19, 20], where IRC safe jets have been reconstructed for the\nMPI08\n\n47\n\n\ffirst time in heavy ion collisions.\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nSince 2005 numerous developments have intervened in jet physics. A number of fast and infrared\nand collinear safe algorithms are now available, allowing for great flexibility in analyses. Tools\nhave been developed and practically implemented to calculate jet areas, and these can used to\nstudy various types of backgrounds (underlying event, pileup, heavy ions background) and also\nto subtract their contribution to large transverse-momentum jets.\nThese new algorithms and methods (as well as the ones not mentioned in this talk, like\nthe many approaches to jet substructure, see e.g. [21\u201325], useful in a number of new-physics\nsearches) are transforming jet physics from being just a procedure to obtain calculable observables to providing a full array of precision tools with which to probe efficiently the complex final\nstates of high energy collisions.\nAcknowledgments\nI wish to thank the organizers of MPI@LHC'08 in Perugia for the invitation to this interesting\nconference, as well as Gavin P.

Such model turns out to be\nvery successful in reproducing the UA5 charged multiplicity distributions and in accounting for\nthe violation of the sensitive Koba Nielsen Olesen scaling violation at increasing center of mass\nenergies.\nThe implementation of the MPI in the QCD Monte Carlo models is quickly proceeding\nthrough an increasing level of sophistication and complexity, still leaving room for different\napproaches and further improvements like the introduction of a dynamical quantum description\nof the interacting hadrons providing a modeling of the diffractive interactions in the same context.\nSee the detailed discussion in the introduction of Section IV.\nAs deeply discussed both in Section I and Section II, considerable progress in the phenomenological study of the Underlying Event (UE) in jet events is achieved by the CDF experiment at the Tevatron collider, with a variety of redundant measurements relying both on charged\ntracks and calorimetric clusters, the former being intrinsically free from the pile-up effects and\nachieving a better sensitivity at low pT . Challenging tests to the universality features of the models are provided by the extension of the UE measurement to the Drell Yan topologies and by the\nadditional complementary measurements on MB events dealing with the correlations between\ncharged multiplicity and average charged momentum.\nWhile preparing the ground for the traditional Minimum Bias (MB),Underlying Event\n(UE) and Double Scattering (DS) measurements at the LHC along the precious Tevatron experience also complemented with the recent UE HERA results, new feasibility studies are proposed\nwhich in perspective will constitute a challenge to the predictivity and to the consistency of the\nmodels: the usage of jet clustering algorithms providing an automated estimation of the UE\nactivity, the measurement of large pseudo-rapidity activity correlations, the investigation of the\nmini-jet structure of the MB events, the evaluation of the impact of the MPI on the total cross\nsection.\nWith the LHC data taking period approaching, the experiments put a lot of emphasis on\nthe physics validation and tuning of the models, in particular for what concerns the energy dependency of the parameters. The tune of the MPI parameters is a very delicate issue which has\nimpact on the calibration of major physics tools like the vertex reconstruction and the isolation\ntechniques.\nA significant fraction of the early measurements of ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, LHCb and\nTOTEM will be affected by the MPI, with most of the LHC feasibility studies shown in these\nproceedings turned into physics publications in a reasonably short time scale. In other words the\nMPI will be one of the first features of the LHC physics which will be deeply tested with an high\ndegree of complementarity and redundancy, and we should be ready for possible surprises!\nMPI08\n\n53\n\n\f54\n\nMPI08\n\n\fMultiple Production of W Bosons in pp and pA Collisions\nE. Braidot, E. Cattaruzza, A. Taracchini, D. Treleani\u2020\nDepartment of Theoretical Physics, University of Trieste and INFN, Section of Trieste\nAbstract\nThe production of equal sign W boson pairs, through single and double parton collisions, are comparable in magnitude at the LHC. As a\nconsequence of the strong anti-shadowing of MPI in interactions with\nnuclei, the double scattering contribution is further enhanced in the\ncase of hadron-nucleus collisions\n1\n\nMultiple production of W bosons in proton-proton collisions\n\nMultiple parton interactions are a manifestation of the unitarity problem caused by the rapid\nincrease of the parton flux at small x, which leads to a dramatic growth of all cross sections with\nlarge momentum transfer in pp collisions at the LHC [5]. The critical kinematical regime may\nbe identified by comparing the rate of double collisions with the rate of single collisions. When\nthe two rates become comparable multiple collisions are no more a small perturbation and all\nmultiple collisions become equally important, while the production of large pt partons becomes\na common feature of the inelastic event [10] [3]. In its simplest implementation [9] the double\nparton scattering cross section \u03c3D is given by\n\u03c3D =\n\n1 \u03c3S2\n2 \u03c3ef f\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c3S is the single scattering cross section. The problem with unitarity becomes hence critical\nin the kinematical domain where \u03c3S and the scale factor \u03c3ef f are of the same order.\nThe experimental indication is that the value of \u03c3ef f is close to 10 mb [1]. One might\nhence conclude that one should worry about multiple parton collisions only when the single scattering cross section becomes comparable with \u03c3ef f . On the contrary multiple parton collisions\nmay represent an important effect also in cases where the single scattering cross section is many\norders of magnitude smaller that \u03c3ef f . The consideration applies to the interesting case of the\nproduction of equal sign W boson pairs. The leptonic decay channel of W bosons, which leads\nto final states with isolated leptons plus missing energy, is in fact of great interest for the search\nof new physics [2].\nThe production of two equal sign W bosons is a higher order process in the Standard\nModel and two equal sign W bosons can be produced only in association with two jets [7]. At\n4 ) and 16 diagrams at O(\u03b12 \u03b12 ) (some of the\nthe lowest order there are 68 diagrams at O(\u03b1W\nS W\ndiagrams are shown in Fig.1) and, even though \u03b1S > \u03b1W , the strong and electroweak diagrams\ngive comparable contributions to the cross section, which is infrared and collinear safe and can\nbe evaluated without imposing any cutoff in the final state quark jets.\n\u2020\n\nspeaker\n\nMPI08\n\n55\n\n\fFig. 1: Some of the three level diagrams which contribute to equal sign W pairs production\n\nThe resulting cross sections to produce W bosons and W boson pairs, by single parton\nscattering in pp interactions, are shown in Fig.2 as a function of the c.m. energy. As apparent in\nthe figure (left upper panel) the cross section to produce two equal sign W bosons is five orders\nof magnitude smaller with respect to the cross section to produce a single W boson. The same\nreduction factor is expected for the production of two equal sign W bosons through a multiple\ncollisions processes:\n1\n\u03c3W\n\u03c3W W = \u03c3W\n,\n2\n\u03c3ef f\n\n\u03c3W\n102 nb\n\ufffd\n= 10\u22125\n\u03c3ef f\n10mb\n\n(2)\n\nThe argument above relies on the simplest expression of the double scattering cross section, obtained by assuming a factorized expression for the the double parton distributions, which\nis obviously inconsistent in the case of the valence because of the correlations induced by flavor\nconservation. In the actual case, given the large mass of the W bosons, one may expect important\ncontributions of the valence also at the LHC. One may hence normalize the double parton distributions in such a way to satisfy the flavor sum rules and work out the double scattering cross\nsection accordingly. The effect on the cross section is shown in the left lower panel of Fig.2,\nwhich shows that, at the LHC, the cross sections is reduced by about 20%.\nThe integrated rates of equal sign W boson pairs, by single and double parton collisions,\nare hence comparable in pp collisions at the LHC. The distribution in phase space is however\nrather different in the two cases.\nIn the right lower panel of Fig.2 we show the distribution of the produced W s, as a function\nof their transverse momenta.

The two contributions\nmay be separated with a cut of 15 GeV/c in the transverse momenta of the produced W s. In Fig. 3\nwe show how the W + bosons (left panels) and their decay electrons (right panels) are distributed\nin transverse momentum and rapidity. The case of double parton collisions is shown in the upper\npanels, while the case of single parton collisions is shown in the lower panels. In the case of\na double parton collision, the W bosons are mainly produced with small transverse momenta,\nwhile the rapidity distribution of the W boson reminds the momentum of the originating up\nquarks. The distributions of the final state charged leptons is peaked at the same rapidity of the\nparent W boson and at a transverse momentum corresponding to 1/2 of the W boson mass.\nIn the case of single parton collisions (lower panels of Fig.3) the W s and the corresponding\ndecay leptons have a much broader distribution in pt and rapidity and the characteristic peaks of\nthe double scatterings are completely absent. The two contributions are hence disentangled very\neasily by adopting appropriate cuts in rapidity and transverse momenta of the finally observed\ncharged leptons.\n\nW+W+\n\nW+W+\n\ne+e+\n\ne+e+\n\nFig. 3: W + W + and e+ e+ pairs distribution in transverse momentum and rapidity, in the case of single parton\ncollision (upper panels) and of double parton collisions (lower panels) in proton-proton collisions.\n\n58\n\nMPI08\n\n\f2\n\nMultiple production of W bosons in proton-nucleus collisions\n\nAs pointed out in [11], a major feature of MPI in hadron-nucleus collisions is the strong antishadowing. Double parton collisions may in fact be amplified by a factor 2 or 3 on heavy nuclei\nas compared with the corresponding cross section in hadron-nucleon collisions multiplied by the\natomic mass number A. Notice that for, say, values of x of the order of 10\u22123 and for values of\nQ2 > 10 GeV2 , the usual nuclear shadowing correction is a much smaller effect and corresponds\nto a reduction of the cross section not larger than 10% even on heavy nuclei [6]. The effect\nis schematically illustrated in Fig. 4, where non additive corrections to the nuclear structure\nfunctions are neglected, in such a way that each nuclear parton may be associated to a given\nparent nucleon. As shown in Fig.4, in proton-nucleus interactions one may hence distinguish\ntwo different contributions to the double parton scattering cross section, depending wether the\ntwo nuclear partons undergoing the interactions are originated by one or by two different target\nnucleons.\n\nFig. 4: W production cross sections by single parton scattering in pp collisions as a function of the c.m. energy.\n\nThe cross section may thus be written as the sum of two terms\nA\nA\nA\n\u03c3D\n= \u03c3D\n|1 + \u03c3D\n|2\n\n(3)\n\nand\n\nA\n\u03c3D\n|1\n\n2\n1 \u03c3W\n=\n2 \u03c3ef f\n\n\ufffd\n\nd bT (b) \u221d A,\n2\n\nA\n\u03c3D\n|2\n\n1 2\n= \u03c3W\n2\n\n\ufffd\n\nd2 bT 2 (b) \u221d A4/3\n\nThe anti-shadowing effect is apparent in Fig.5, where the W production cross sections in\nproton-proton collisions are compared with the cross sections in proton-nucleus collisions (after\ndividing by the atomic mass number A).

The\nW bosons are produced with a small transverse momentum, while the rapidity distribution of the\nW boson reminds the momentum of the originating up quark. The asymmetry in rapidity is due\nto the different content of up quarks in the proton as compared with the content of up quarks in\nthe pairs of nucleons of the target nucleus undergoing the process (pp, pn and nn). The distributions of the final charged leptons is peaked at the same rapidity of the parent W boson and, as in\nthe case of proton-proton interactions, at a transverse momentum corresponding to 1/2 of the W\nboson mass.\n\ne+e+\n\nW+W+\n\nW+W+\n\ne+e+\n\nFig. 6: W + W + and e+ e+ pairs distribution in transverse momentum and rapidity, in the case of single parton\ncollision (upper panels) and of double parton collisions (lower panels) in proton-nucleus collisions.\n\nThe distributions of equal sign W bosons and of the decay leptons generated by single\nparton collisions in pA interactions are shown in the lower panels of Fig.6 (left and right respectively) as a function of rapidity and transverse momenta. The contribution of double collisions\nis overwhelming when selecting leptons with transverse momenta of the order of one half of the\nW mass.\n\nMPI08\n\n61\n\n\f3\n\nConcluding summary\n\nEqual sign W boson pairs are produced by a higher order process in the SM. As a consequence,\nthe cross section to produce two W bosons with equal sign is more than two orders of magnitude\nsmaller in pp collisions at the LHC, as compared with the cross section to produce two W bosons\nwith opposite sign. An outcome is that the integrated cross sections, to produce two equal sign\nW bosons through single and double parton collisions, are similar in magnitude. The equal sign\nW bosons and the corresponding decay leptons are however distributed very differently in phase\nspace by the two production mechanisms, which allows to disentangle the two contributions\neasily by looking at the distribution of the decay leptons.\nAs a consequence of the strong anti-shadowing of MPI in collisions with nuclei, the contribution of double scattering is greatly enhanced in the case of hadron-nucleus collisions.\nReferences\n[1] F.

Assuming uncorrelated partons, we check for consistency between an impact parameter description of multiple hard collisions and\nextrapolations of the total inelastic profile function. We emphasize the\navailability of parameterizations to experimental data for the impact\nparameter dependence of hard collisions.\n1 Introduction\nA satisfactory description of the complex hadronic final states expected at the LHC must certainly\nincorporate a description of multiple partonic collisions. However, models of multiple collisions\nnecessarily use techniques that mix perturbative and nonperturbative processes. It is therefore\nimportant to incorporate as much experimentally available input about the structure of the proton as possible. Information about the impact parameter dependence of hard collisions can be\nobtained from parameterizations of generalized parton distribution functions (GPDs). The gluon\nGPD can be measured experimentally in electroproduction of light vector mesons at small-x or\nin photoproduction of heavy vector mesons. Because it is a universal objects, the gluon GPD\ncan then be used in the impact parameter description of multiple hard collisions in pp scattering.\nFurthermore, it is possible to make direct use of the relationship between inclusive and total cross\nsections to obtain consistency constraints. In this contribution, we give a summary of the steps\npresented in [1] for comparing a description of multiple hard scattering that utilizes GPDs with\nextrapolations of the total inelastic cross section. This allows us to obtain constraints on the minimum value of the lower transverse momentum cutoff in the perturbative QCD (pQCD) formula\nfor inclusive dijet production.\n2 Total Inelastic Cross Section in Impact Parameter Space\nThe standard way of describing the total pp cross section in impact parameter space is to use the\nprofile function, defined in terms of the elastic amplitude A(s, t) as\n\ufffd\n1\nd2 q eiq*b A(s, t).\n(1)\n\u0393(s, b) =\n2is(2\u03c0)2\n\u2020\n\nspeaker\n\nMPI08\n\n63\n\n\fThe optical theorem then allows the total, elastic, and inelastic cross sections to be expressed in\nterms of the profile function:\n\ufffd\n\u03c3tot (s) = 2 d2 b Re \u0393(s, b),\n(2)\n\ufffd\n\u03c3el (s) =\nd2 b |\u0393(s, b)|2 ,\n(3)\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\u03c3inel (s) =\nd2 b 2 Re \u0393(s, b) \u2212 |\u0393(s, b)|2\n(4)\n\ufffd\n=\nd2 b \u0393inel (s, b),\n(5)\nThe last line defines the inelastic profile function, \u0393inel (s, b). If the amplitude is dominantly\nimaginary, then unitarity requires \u0393, \u0393inel \u2264 1.\n\nExperimental measurements at currently accessible energies find a slow growth for the\ntotal cross section and a slow broadening of the profile function with increasing energy (see\n2\ne.g. [2] and references therein). In a standard fit to the profile function of the form \u223c e\u2212b /2B(s)\nwith B(s) = B0 + \u03b1\ufffd ln s, comparisons with data then yields \u03b1\ufffd \u2248 0.25 GeV\u22122 , and a slope at\nLHC energies (14 TeV) of about B \u2248 21.8 GeV\u22122 . As illustrated in [3], there are only small\nvariations between different model extrapolation.\nIn the next few sections, we will address the issue of consistency between such extrapolations and descriptions of multiple hard collisions that utilize GPDs. For the purpose of illustration\nwe will work with the model for the profile function obtained in [4].\n3 Inclusive Hard Collisions in Impact Parameter Space\nIn most perturbative or semiperturbative treatments of multiple collisions, the basic input is the\nlowest order inclusive perturbative QCD (pQCD) expression for the dijet production:\n\ufffd \u221e\nd\u03c3\u0302\ninc\nc\n(6)\n\u03c32jet (s; pt ) =\nd p2t 2 fi/p1 (x1 ; pt ) \u2297 fj/p2 (x2 ; pt ).\ndpt\npct 2\n\nImplicit but not shown are a sum over parton types, a K factor, and any necessary symmetry\nfactors. The hard partonic differential cross section is for 2 \u2192 2 partonic scattering between\npartons of type i and j. The symbol \u2297 represents convolutions in momentum fraction. The\nparton distribution functions (PDFs) are evaluated at a hard scale which for dijet production\nshould be approximately equal to the relative transverse momentum pt of the produced dijet pair.\nFor pQCD to be valid, the pt integral in Eq. (6) must be cut off from below by some scale pct .\nincl (s; pc ) is quite sensitive to the precise value\nBecause Eq. 6) diverges at low pt , The value of \u03c32jet\nt\nof this cutoff. It should be chosen large enough for perturbation theory to be safe, but small\nenough to incorporate the maximum possible range of kinematics.\nA description of where hard collisions take place in impact parameter space can be extracted directly from experimental measurements of the gluon GPD. The GPD describes nondiagonal transitions in the target arising from the exchange of two t-channel gluons, as illustrated\n64\n\nMPI08\n\n\f\u03b3(\u03b3 \u2217)\nV\n\nt\n\nP\ufffd\n\nP\n\nFig. 1: The basic graphical structure in heavy vector meson photoproduction (or light vector meson small-x electroproduction) with two gluons exchanged in the t-channel.

It is related to the standard gluon PDF via the relation\nxfg (x, t; \u03bc) = xfg (x; \u03bc)Fg (x, t; \u03bc)\n\n(7)\n\nwhere Fg (x, t; \u03bc) parameterizes the t-dependence and is referred to as the two-gluon form factor.\nThe GPD is evaluated at a hard scale \u03bc, and it reduces to the standard gluon PDF at t = 0. Fourier\ntransforming Eq. (7) into transverse coordinate space gives the impact parameter dependent GPD,\n\ufffd\nFg (x, \u03c1; \u03bc) = d2 \u2206 Fg (x, t; \u03bc) e\u2212i\u2206*\u03c1 ,\nt \u2261 \u2212\u22062 .\n(8)\nBecause the GPD in Eq. (7) is a universal object [5], it can be combined directly with Eq. (6) to\nyield a description of the impact parameter dependent inclusive dijet cross section in pp scattering. If we define the overlap function,\n\ufffd\nP2 (b, x1 , x2 ; \u03bc) = d2 \u03c11 Fg (x, |\u03c11 |; \u03bc)Fg (x, |b \u2212 \u03c11 |; \u03bc),\n(9)\nthen the probability for a single hard collision with \u03bc \u2248 pt at impact parameter b is\ninc\nN2 (s, b; pct ) = \u03c32jets\n(s; pct )P2 (s, b; pct ).\n\n(10)\n\nThe subscript 2 refers to the production of a dijet pair.

(10) by simply using the definition of\nthe total inclusive inelastic cross section [7]. To see very generally how this works, we start with\nthe exact formula obtained in [1] for the total inelastic profile function, written as a series of\ncontributions from higher numbers of collisions:\nc\n\u0393inel\njets (s, b; pt ) =\n\n\u221e\n\ufffd\n\n(\u22121)n\u22121 N2n (s, b; pct ) .\n\n(12)\n\nn=1\n\nFor n > 1, N2n (s, b; pct ) is the probability function analogous to Eq. (10) but for an n parton\ncollision. For collisions involving identical uncorrelated partons\nN2n (s, b; pct ) =\n\n1\nN2 (s, b; pct )2 .\nn!\n\n(13)\n\nWith this conjecture, Eq. (12) is a geometric series that becomes simply,\nc\nc\n\u0393inel\njets (s, b; pt ) = 1 \u2212 exp [\u2212N2 (s, b; pt )] .\n\n(14)\n\nHence, the assumption of uncorrelated partons results in what is typically referred to as the\neikonal model. In a complete model of multiple partonic collisions, the effect of soft interactions\nis usually incorporated by including extra soft eikonal factors in the exponential of Eq. (14).\nConsistency between extrapolations of the total inelastic profile function in Eq. (5) and\nEq. (12) requires,\nc\ninel\n\u0393inel\n(s, b).\n(15)\njets (s, b; pt ) < \u0393\nNow we can check directly whether Eq. (15) is satisfied for a particular extrapolation of the total\n66\n\nMPI08\n\n\f\u221a\nprofile function. As an example, we show in Fig. 2 the model of [4] at s = 14 TeV. We compare this with Eq. (14) calculated using the parameterization for the two-gluon form factor taken\nfrom [6] for the b-dependence of the hard collisions. The total inclusive cross section is calculated directly from Eq. (6) using the CTEQ6M parameterizations [8] for the parton distribution\nfunctions. The calculation is shown for three sample values of pct .\nFor very small b it is not that surprising that Eq. (15) is violated since this is the region\nwhere at very high energies the gluon density becomes large and nonlinear gluon recombination\neffects are expected to lead to taming of the gluon distribution. However, the plot in Fig. 2\nshows that for pct \ufffd 3.5 GeV, there is even a problem with Eq. (15) at rather large b \u223c 1.5 fm\nwhere the uncorrelated assumption would naively be expected to be a good approximation. This\nimplies that a rather large choice for pct is needed to maintain consistency between a description\nof multiple hard collisions in terms of the gluon GPD and the total inelastic profile function. We\nnote that a value of pct between 3 GeV and 4 GeV is consistent with the parameter constraints\nreported by the Herwig++ group [9].\nWe note that it is certainly possible that the actual high energy total inelastic profile function is much different from current extrapolations. Whether this is true will be answered as higher\nenergy data become available. However, as mentioned in Sect. 2 there is little variation between\ndifferent extrapolations, and there would have to be a rather large deviation from general theoretical expectations in order to bring the total inelastic profile function into agreement with Eq. (15)\nwith a small value for pct . Regardless of what the true form of the high energy extrapolation\nprofile function is, the consistency requirement of Eq. (15) should somehow be enforced.\nAssuming for now that we have a roughly correct description of the total inelastic profile\nfunction for pp scattering, a violation of Eq. (15) for a given pct implies a breakdown of one of the\nbasic assumptions. Either the uncorrelated assumption of Eq. (13) is badly violated, or Eq. (10)\nis not an accurate description of the basic hard scattering. Hence, an improved description of\nthe low-pt region at large b likely requires some modeling of correlations. A general procedure\nfor including transverse correlations has recently been proposed in [10]. An approach that goes\nbeyond the standard pQCD description of the hard part by resumming soft gluons is suggested\nin [11]. A characteristic of the second method is that the width of the hard scattering overlap\nfunction becomes much narrower than what is expected from the 2-gluon form factor at high\nenergies.\nUsing a narrower radius for the hard profile function ultimately allows total and inelastic\ncross sections to be fitted with smaller values for pct (see, for example, [12]). We remark, however,\nthat a narrower width for the hard part implies that N2 (s, b; pct ) grows large with energy very\nquickly at small-b. In deep inelastic scattering this would correspond to a very rapid approach\nto the unitarity limit. Thus, if the width of the hard part is too narrow, there is a danger that it\nwill violate constraints from HERA data on the approach to the saturation limit. Furthermore, an\nextremely narrow b-distribution in the hard overlap function would correspond to a t-dependence\nfor the 2-gluon form factor that is too weak. As an alternative approach, we suggest directly\nmodifying the uncorrelated assumption in Eq. (13).\n\nMPI08\n\n67\n\n\f5 Conclusion\nWe have illustrated that, by describing the hard profile function in multiple collisions using parameterizations of the GPD and requiring consistency with model extrapolations of the total\ninelastic profile functions, we may obtain constraints on the allowed minimum transverse momentum cutoff pct in the inclusive hard scattering cross section. For the case of uncorrelated hard\ncollisions, we find that a rather large value for pct is needed.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank R. Godbole and G. Pancheri for useful discussions.

It takes into account both hard partonic processes and\nsoft gluon emission effects to describe the proper high energy behavior\nand to respect the Froissart bound.\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nA reliable prediction of the total proton-proton cross section is fundamental to know which will\nbe the underlying activity at the LHC and for new discoveries in physics from the LHC data. In\nthis article, we shall describe a model [1] [2] for the hadronic total cross section based on QCD\nminijet formalism. The model includes a resummation of soft gluon radiation which is necessary\nto tame the fast high-energy rise typical of a purely perturbative minijet model. It is called the BN\nmodel from the Bloch and Nordsiek discussion of the infrared catastrophe in QED. In the first\nsection, results are presented concerning the behavior of the QCD minijet cross section. It will\nthen be explained how this term is included into an eikonal formalism where infrared soft gluon\nemission effects are added. The last section is devoted to the link between the total cross-section\nasymptotic high energy behavior predicted by our model and the model parameters. This relation\nalso shows that our prediction is in agreement with the limit imposed by the Froissart bound.\n2\n\nMini-jet cross section\n\nHard processes involving high-energy partonic collisions drive the rise of the total cross section\n[3]. These jet-producing collisions are typical perturbative processes and we can describe them\nthrough the usual QCD expression:\n\ufffd 1\n\ufffd 1\n\ufffd \u221as/2\nkl (\u015d)\n\ufffd\nd\u03c3\u0302ij\nAB\ndx2 \u00d7\nfi|A (x1 , p2t )fj|B (x2 , p2t )\n.\ndx1\ndpt\n\u03c3jet (s, ptmin ) =\ndpt\n4p2t /(x1 s)\n4p2t /s\nptmin\ni,j,k,l\n(1)\nwith A, B = p, p\u0304. This expression depends on the parameter ptmin which represents the minimum transverse momentum of the scattered partons for which one allows a perturbative QCD\ntreatment. Its value is usually around \u2248 1 \u2212 2 GeV and it distinguishes hard processes (that\nare processes for which a perturbative approach is used) from the soft ones that dominate at low\n\u2020\n\nspeaker\n\nMPI08\n\n69\n\n\f\u221a\nenergy, typically for s \u2264 10 \u00f7 20 GeV , i.e, well before the cross-section starts rising. The\nMinijet expression also depends on the DGLAP evoluted Partonic Densities Functions fi|A for\nwhich there exist in the literature different LO parameterizations(GRV, MRST, CTEQ [4]). We\nobtain an asymptotic growth of \u03c3jet with energy as a power of s. As shown in figure 1, the value\nof the exponent depends on the PDF used and one has\nGRV\n\u03c3jet\n\u2248 s0.4\n\nM RST\n\u03c3jet\n\u2248 s0.3\n\nCT EQ\n\u03c3jet\n\u2248 s0.3\n\nThis result can be derived by considering the relevant contribution to the integral in (1) in the\n\u221a\ns >> ptmin limit. In this limit, the major contribution comes from the small fractions of\nmomentum carried by the colliding gluons with x1,2 << 1. In this limit we know that the relevant\nPDF's behave approximately like powers of the momentum fraction x\u2212J with J \u223c 1.3 [5].\nkl (\u015d)\nd\u03c3\u0302ij\ndpt\n\nFrom the previous consideration and noting that\nasymptotic high-energy expression for \u03c3jet\n\u03c3jet \u221d\n\n1\n\n\ufffd\n\ns\n\np2t min 4p2t min\n\n1\np3t\n\nwe obtain from (1) the following\n\n\ufffdJ\u22121\n\n(2)\n\n\u221d\n\nThe dominant term is just a power of s and the estimate obtained for the exponent \ufffd =\nJ \u2212 1 \u223c 0.3 is in agreement with our previous results. We now need to understand how to\nincorporate into a model for the total cross section this very fast rise at very high energy, which\nis present in the perturbative regime. Firstly it is important to note that \u03c3jet is an inclusive cross\nsection and therefore contains in itself a multiplicity factor, linked to the average number < n >\nof partonic collisions that take place during the hadronic scattering. We can approximate the\nenergy driving term at high energy [6] < n > as\n< n >\u2248 \u03c3jet * A\n\n(3)\n\nwhere A is a function representing the overlap between the two hadrons.\nNow we can derive an expression for the total cross section as a function of < n >. Assuming that the number of partonic collisions follows a Poisson distribution, since each interaction is\nindipendent from the other, the probability of having k partonic collisions is:\nP (k, < n >) =\n\n< n >k e\u2212<n>\nk!\n\n(4)\n\nThe average number of partonic collisions should depend on the energy and on the impact parameter b relative to the hadronic process < n >\u2261< n(b, s) >. From the previous expression it\nis possible to obtain the inelastic hadronic cross section:\n\u03c3inelastic =\n\n\ufffd\n\nd2 b\n\n\ufffd\n\nk=1\n\nP (k, < n(b, s) >) =\n\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\nd2 b 1 \u2212 e\u2212<n(b,s)>\n\n\ufffd\n\n(5)\n\nwhich is the usual eikonal expression if we consider the link between < n(b, s) > and the eikonal\n\u03c7(b, s).\n< n(b, s) >= 2Im\u03c7(b, s)\n(6)\n70\n\nMPI08\n\n\f\u03c3jet(mb)\n\n10000\n\u03c3jet for various LO densities\nptmin=1.15 GeV\n\n9000\n8000\n7000\n\nCTEQ\n\n6000\n\nGRV98\n\n5000\n\nGRV\n\n4000\n\ngreen band MRST\n\n3000\n2000\n1000\n\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n4\n\n10\n\u221as ( GeV )\n\nFig. 1: minijet cross section for different input parton densities.\n\n3\n\nEikonal model\n\nThe eikonal representation allows to implement multiple parton scattering and to restore a finite\nsize of the interaction. Neglecting the real part of the eikonal function, an acceptable approximation in the high energy limit, the expression for the total cross section is\n\u03c3tot = 2\n\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\nd2 b 1 \u2212 e\u2212n(b,s)/2\n\n\ufffd\n\n(7)\n\nThe average number of partonic collisions receives contributions both from hard and soft physics\nprocesses and we write it in the form\nn(b, s) = nsof t (b, s) + nhard (b, s)\n\n(8)\n\nwhere the soft term parameterizes the contribution of all the processes for which the partons\nscatter with pt < ptmin . It is the only relevant term at low-energy and it establishes the overall\nnormalization, while the hard term is responsible for the high-energy rise. From (3), we approximate this term with\nnhard (b, s) = A(b, s)\u03c3jet (s)\n(9)\nwhere the minijet cross section drives the rise due to the increase of the number of partonic\ncollisions with the energy and A(b, s) is the overlap function which depends on the (energy\nMPI08\n\n71\n\n\fdependent) spatial distribution of partons inside the colliding hadrons. In some older models\n[6] a simpler factorized expression for n(b, s) was used, with the overlap function depending\nonly on b. However, when up-to-date realistic parton densities are used, such impact parameter\ndistributions, inspired by constant hadronic form factors, led to an excessive rise of \u03c3tot with the\nenergy. In our BN model we include an s-dependence in the overlap function that has to tame\nthe strong growth due to the fast asymptotic rise of \u03c3jet [2].\nWe identify soft gluon emissions from the colliding partons as the physical effect responsible for the attenuation of the rise of the total cross section. These emissions influence matter\ndistribution inside of the hadrons, hence changing the overlap function. They break collinearity\nbetween the colliding partons, diminishing the efficiency of the scattering process. The number of soft emissions increases with the energy and this makes their contribution important, also\nat very high energy. The calculation of this effect uses a semiclassical approach based on a\nBlock-Nordsieck inspired formalism [7] through which one obtains a distribution of the colliding partons as function of the transverse momentum of the soft gluons emitted in the collision,\ni.e.\n\ufffd\n1\n2\n2\nd2 b eiK\u22a5 *b\u2212h(b,qmax )\n(10)\nd P (K\u22a5 ) = d K\u22a5\n(2\u03c0)2\nWe have proposed to obtain the overlap function as the Fourier transform of the previous expression of the soft gluon transverse momentum resummed distribution, namely to put\nABN (b, s) = N\nwith\n\n\ufffd\n\nd2 K\u22a5 e\u2212iK\u22a5 *b\n\ufffd\n\nd2 P (K\u22a5 )\ne\u2212h(b,qmax )\n\ufffd\n=\nd2 K\u22a5\nd2 b e\u2212h(b,qmax )\n\n(11)\n\n16 qmax \u03b1s (kt2 ) dkt\n2qmax\nh(b, qmax ) =\nlog\n[1 \u2212 J0 (kt b)]\n(12)\n3 0\n\u03c0\nkt\nkt\nThis integral is performed up to a maximum value which is linked to the maximum transverse\nmomentum allowed by the kinematics, qmax [8]. In principle, this parameter and the overlap\nfunction should be calculated for each partonic sub-process, but in the partial factorization of\nEq.(9) we use an average value of qmax obtained considering all the sub-processes that can happen for a given energy of the main hadronic process [2]:\n\ufffd \ufffd dx1 \ufffd dx2 \ufffd 1\n\u221a\n\ufffd\nx1\nx2 zmin dzfi (x1 )fj (x2 ) x1 x2 (1 \u2212 z)\ns i,j\nqmax (s) =\n(13)\n\ufffd \ufffd dx1 \ufffd dx2 \ufffd 1\n2\nx1\nx2 zmin dzfi (x1 )fj (x2 )\ni,j\n\nwith zmin = 4p2tmin /(sx1 x2 ). Notice that consistency of the calculation requires that the PDF's\nused in Eq. (13) be the same as those used in \u03c3jet.\nThe integral in (12) has another relevant feature, it extends down to zero momentum values, and to calculate it we have to take an expression of \u03b1s different from the perturbative QCD\nexpression which is singular and not integrable in (12). We use a phenomenological expression [9], which coincides with the usual QCD limit for large kt , and is singular but integrable for\nkt \u2192 0:\np\n12\u03c0\n(14)\n\u03b1s (kt2 ) =\n33 \u2212 2Nf ln[1 + p( k\u039bt )2p ]\n72\n\nMPI08\n\n\fThis expression for \u03b1s is inspired by the Richardson expression for a linear confining potential\n[10], and we find for the parameter p that\n\u2022 p < 1 to have a convergent integral (unlike the case of the Richardson potential where\np = 1)\n\u2022 p > 1/2 for the correct analyticity in the momentum transfer variable.\n\n\u03c3tot(mb)\n\nFig.2 [1] shows our predictions, obtained for the total cross-section using a set of phenomenological values for ptmin and p, and varying the parton densities.

In order to see see that in our model this bound is respected, we approximate\nour total cross section at very large energies as\n\u03c3tot \u2248 2\u03c0\nMPI08\n\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\ndb2 1 \u2212 e\u2212nhard (b,s)/2\n\n\ufffd\n\n(15)\n73\n\n\fwith nhard (b, s) \u2248 \u03c3jet(s)Ahard (b, s).

Being\n\nAhard (b, s) \u221d e\u2212h(b,s)\nwe can consider in (12) the infrared limit kt \u2192 0 where the integral receives the dominant\ncontribution.

We can now understand why a knowledge\nof the confining phase of the strong interaction is necessary if we want to restore the finite size\nof the hadronic interaction.\nReferences\n[1] A.

The data were collected\nwith a minimum-bias trigger at the Tevatron Collider with the CDF II\nexperiment. Previous measurements are widely extended in range and\nprecision. A comparison with a PYTHIA prediction at the hadron level\nis performed. Inclusive particle production is fairly well reproduced\nonly in the low transverse momentum range. Final state correlation\nmeasurements are poorly reproduced, but favor models with multiple\nparton interactions.\n1 Introduction\nIn hadron collisions, hard interactions are theoretically well described as collisions of two incoming partons along with softer interactions from the remaining partons. The so-called minimumbias (MB) interactions, on the contrary, can only be defined through a description of the experimental apparatus that triggers the collection of the data. Such a trigger is meant to collect events\nfrom all possible inelastic interactions proportionally to their natural production rate. MB physics\noffers a unique ground for studying both the theoretically poorly understood softer phenomena\nand the interplay between the soft and the hard perturbative interactions.\nThe understanding of the softer components of MB is interesting not only in its own right,\nbut is also important for precision measurements of hard interactions in which soft effects need\nto be subtracted (see, e.g. [1]). The observables that are experimentally accessible in the MB\nfinal state represent a complicated mixture of different physics effects such that most models\ncould readily be tuned to give an acceptable description of each single observable, but not to\ndescribe simultaneously the entire set. Effects due to multiple parton parton interactions (MPI)\nare essential for an exhaustive description of inelastic non-diffractive hadron interactions.\n2 The CDF Detector and Data Samples\n2.1\n\nThe Data Collection and Event Selection\n\nThis analysis is based on an integrated luminosity of 506 pb1 collected with the CDF II detector\n\u221a\nat s = 1.96 TeV during the first Tevatron stores in Run II. CDF II is a general purpose detector\nthat combines precision charged particle tracking with projective geometry calorimeter towers.\nA detailed description of the detector, with detailed information about the transverse momentum\n(pT ) and transverse energy (ET ) resolutions, can be found elsewhere [2].\nTwo systems of gas Cherenkov counters (CLC) [3], covering the pseudorapidity forward\nregions 3.7 < |\u03b7| < 4.7, are used to determine the luminosity. The MB trigger is implemented\nby requiring a coincidence in time of signals in both forward and backward CLC modules.\n76\n\nMPI08\n\n\fOnly runs with lower initial instantaneous luminosity have been used in order to reduce the\neffects of event pile-up. The average instantaneous luminosity of the full MB sample is roughly\n20 \u00d7 1030 cm\u22122 s\u22121 . For measurements where the calorimeter is involved, only a subsample of\naverage luminosity 17 \u00d7 1030 cm\u22122 s\u22121 was used.\n\nPrimary vertices are identified by the convergence of reconstructed tracks along the z\u2212axis.\nFor vertices reconsructed from less than ten tracks a requirement that they be symmetric is added:\nthe quantity |(N + N )/(N + + N )|, where N \u00b1 is the number of tracks in the positive or negative\n\u03b7 hemisphere, cannot equal one. Only events that contain one, and only one, primary vertex in\nthe fiducial region |Zvtx | \u2264 40 cm centered around the nominal CDF z = 0 position are accepted. This fiducial interval is further restricted to |Zvtx | \u2264 20 cm when measurements with the\ncalorimeter are involved.\n2.2\n\nThe MonteCarlo Sample\n\nA sample of simulated Monte Carlo (MC) events about twice the size of the data was generated\nwith PYTHIA version 6.2 [4], with parameters optimized for the best reproduction of minimumbias interactions. To model the mixture of hard and soft interactions, PYTHIA Tune A [5] [6]\nintroduces a p0T cut off parameter that regulates the divergence of the 2-to-2 parton-parton perturbative cross section at low momenta. This parameter is used also to regulate the additional\nparton-parton scatterings that may occur in the same collision [7]. Thus, fixing the amount of\nmultiple-parton interactions (i.e., setting the pT cut-off) allows the hard 2-to-2 parton-parton\nscattering to be extended all the way down to pT (hard) = 0, without hitting a divergence. The\namount of hard scattering in simulated MB events is, therefore, related to the activity of the socalled underlying event in the hard scattering processes. The final state, likewise, is subject to\nseveral effects such as the treatments of the beam remnants and color (re)connection effects. The\npythia Tune A results presented here are the predictions, not fits.\nA run-dependent simulation with a realistic distribution of multiple interactions was employed to compute corrections and acceptance. Events were fully simulated through the detector\nand successively reconstructed with the standard CDF reconstruction chain. All data is corrected\nto hadron level. The definition of primary particles was to consider all particles with mean lifetime \u03c4 > 0.3 \u00d7 10\u221210 s produced promptly in the pp\u0304 interaction, and the decay products of those\nwith shorter mean lifetimes. With this definition strange hadrons are included among the primary\nparticles, and those that are not reconstructed are corrected for. On the other hand, their decay\nproducts (mainly \u03c0 \u00b1 from KS0 decays) are excluded, while those from heavier flavor hadrons are\nincluded.\n3 Results\n3.1\n\nEfficiency and Acceptance Corrections\n\nReconstructed tracks are accepted if they comply with a minimal set of quality selections. Primary charged particles are selected by requiring that they originate in a fiducial region around\nthe pp\u0304 vertex. In order to optimize the efficiency and acceptance conditions particles are required\nto have a transverse momentum greater than 0.4 GeV/c and pseudorapidity |\u03b7| \u2264 1.\nThe transverse energy sum (\n\nMPI08\n\n\ufffd\n\nET ) is computed in the limited region |\u03b7| \u2264 1 as the scalar\n77\n\n\fsum over the calorimeter towers of the transverse energies in the electromagnetic and hadronic\ncompartments. The calorimeter response has been evaluated with MC. The region below about\n5 GeV is the most critical. The reliability of MC in evaluating the calorimeter response was\nchecked against the single particle response measured from data. The simulation of the energy\ndeposition of neutral particles was assumed to be correct.\nIn the end, all data presented is corrected for the trigger and vertex efficiency, undetected\npile-up, diffractive background and event selection acceptance. Charged particle measurements\nare corrected also for the tracking efficiency, contamination of secondary particles (particle interaction, pair creation), particle decays and mis-identified tracks. These quantties are evaluated\nas a function of pT , in different ranges of track multiplicity. The total correction includes also\nthe smearing correction for very high pT tracks, where the small curvature may cause a signif\ufffd\nicant dispersion in the measure of the momentum.\nET measurements are corrected for the\ncalorimeter response and acceptance, and are unfolded to correct the dispersion due to the finite\ncalorimeter resolution.\n3.2\n\nThe charged particle pT spectrum\n\nWe may write the single-particle invariant pT differential cross section as:\nE\n\nd3 \u03c3\nNpcles /(\u03b5 \u00d7 A)\nd3 \u03c3\n=\n=\n,\n3\ndp\npT \u2206\u03c6\u2206ydpT\nLpT \u2206\u03c6\u2206ydpT\n\n(1)\n\nwhere E, p, \u03c6, and y are the particle energy, momentum, azimuthal angle and rapidity, respectively; Npcles is the raw number of charged particles that is to be corrected for all efficiencies (\u03b5)\nand acceptance (A). L is the effective time-integrated luminosity of the sample. The accepted\nregion in \u2206y is calculated from the \u03b7 for each charged track, always assuming the charged pion\nmass. The differential cross section is shown in Fig. 1.\nThis measure was discussed in [8] and last published by the CDF collaboration in 1988 [9].\nThere is a scale factor of 2 between the 1988 and the new measurement, due to different normalization. Besides this, the new measurement is about 4% higher than the previous one. At least\npart of this difference may be explained by the increased center-of-mass energy of the collisions\nfrom 1800 to 1960 GeV. The new measurement extends the momentum spectrum from 10 to over\n100 GeV/c, and enables verification of the empirical modeling of minimum-bias production up\nto the high pT production region.\nWe observe that modeling the spectrum with the power-law form used in 1988 to fit the\ndistribution, does not account for the high pT tail observed in this measurement (Fig. 1, left).\nNevertheless, in the limited region up to pT = 10 GeV/c, we obtain, for the present data, a\nset of fit parameters compatible with those published in 1988. In our measurement, the tail\nof the distribution is at least three orders of magnitude higher than what could be expected by\nextrapolating to high pT the function that fits the low pT region. In order to fit the whole spectrum,\nwe introduced a more complex parametrization by adding a second term to the function used\nin [9] (Eq.2):\n\ufffd \ufffds\n\ufffdn\n\ufffd\n1\np0\n+B\n.\n(2)\nf =A\npT + p0\npT\n78\n\nMPI08\n\n\f1\n\nfit Run II\n\n10-1\n10\n\nfit Run 1988 (x 2)\n\n-2\n\n10-3\n10-4\n\n-8\n\n10-9\n10\n\n-10\n\n10-11\n10-12\n\n1\n10-1\n10-2\n-3\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n|\u03b7|\u22641\n\n10-6\n\npT \u22650.4 GeV/c\n\n-7\n\n|\u03b7|\u22641\n\n-8\n\nData Run II\n\n-9\n\nPythia TuneA, hadron level\n\n10\n\npT\u22650.4 GeV/c\n\n10\n10\n\nCDF Run II Preliminary\n\n-10\n\n3.5\n\nData / Pythia\n\nTotal uncertainty\n\n40\n20\n\n10-4\n\n10\n\n10-13\n\nUncertainty %\n\nCDF Run II Preliminary\n\n10\n\nT\n\n10-7\n10\n\n102\n\nT\n\n10-6\n\n3\n\n3\n\nT\n\n10\n\n-5\n\nd \u03c3 / p dp dyd\u03c6 [mb/(GeV2 /c 2 )]\n\nData Run II\n\n10\n\nT\n\nd \u03c3 / p dp dyd\u03c6 [mb/(GeV 2/c 2)]\n\n102\n\nSystematic uncertainty\n\u00b16% luminosity uncertainty not included\n\n3\n2.5\n\nData / Pythia TuneA, hadron level\nSystematic uncertainty\n\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n10\n\np\n\nT\n\n10\n\npT [GeV/c]\n\n102\n[GeV/c]\n\nFig. 1: Left: the track pT differential cross section with statistical uncertainty is shown.

Also in this\ncase, the data show a larger cross section at high pT starting from about 20 GeV/c. The MC\ngenerator does not produce any particles at all beyond 50 GeV/c.\n3.3\n\nThe dependence of \ufffdpT \ufffd on the particle multiplicity\n\nThe dependence of the particle transverse momentum on multiplicity (\ufffdpT \ufffd(Nch )) is computed\nas the average pT of all charged primary particles in events with the same charged multiplicity\n(Nch ), as a function of Nch . A study of \ufffdpT \ufffd(Nch ) was already performed by CDF in Run I\nand published in [10]. This new measurement benefits from the larger statistics obtained with a\nMPI08\n\n79\n\n\fdedicated \"high multiplicity\" trigger. Data from this trigger are included by merging them into\nthe MB sample.\nThis is one of the variables most sensitive to the combination of the various physical effects\npresent in MB collisions, and is also the variable most poorly reproduced by the available MC\ngenerators. The rate of change of \ufffdpT \ufffd versus Nch is a measure of the amount of hard versus\nsoft processes contributing to minimum-bias collisions; in simulation the rate is sensitive to the\nmodeling of the multiple-parton interactions (MPI) [1].\n\n< pT > [GeV/c]\n\n1.4\n\nCDF Run II Preliminary\n\n|\u03b7|\u2264 1\n1.3\n\np \u2265 0.4 GeV/c\n\nData Run II\n\nT\n\n1.2\n1.1\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n\nPythia hadron level :\n\n0.7\n\nTuneA no MPI\n\nTuneA p =0\n\nTuneA p =1.5\n\nATLAS tune\n\nT\n\nT\n\n0.6\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\ncharged particle multiplicity\n\n50\n\nFig. 2: The dependence of the average charged particle pT on the event multiplicity is shown. A comparison with various PYTHIA tunes at hadron level is shown. Tune A with p\u0302T 0 = 1.5 GeV/c was used to compute the MC corrections\nin this analysis (the statistical uncertainty is shown only for the highest multiplicities where it is significant). Tune A\nwith p\u0302T 0 = 0 GeV/c is very similar to p\u0302T 0 = 1.5 GeV/c. The same tuning with no multiple parton interactions\nallowed (\"no MPI\") yields an average pT much higher than data for multiplicities greater than about 5. The ATLAS\ntune yields too low an average pT over the whole multiplicity range. The uncertainties shown are only statistical.\n\nIf only two processes contribute to the MB final state, one soft, and one hard (the hard\n2-to-2 parton-parton scattering), then demanding large Nch would preferentially select the hard\nprocess and lead to a high \ufffdpT \ufffd. However, we see from Fig. 2 (Tune A, no MPI) that with\nthese two processes alone, the average pT increases much too rapidly. MPI provide another\nmechanism for producing large multiplicities that are harder than the beam-beam remnants, but\nnot as hard as the primary 2-to-2 hard scattering. By introducing this mechanism, PYTHIA in\nthe Tune A configuration gives a fairly good description of \ufffdpT \ufffd(Nch ) and, although the data are\nquantitatively not exactly reproduced, there is great progress over fits to Run I data [10]. The\nsystematic uncertainty is always within 2%, a value significantly smaller than the discrepancy\nwith data.\n80\n\nMPI08\n\n\f3.4\n\nThe\n\n\ufffd\n\nET spectrum\n\nThe differential cross section d3 \u03c3/(\u2206\u03c6\u2206\u03b7dET ) for |\u03b7| < 1 is shown in Fig. 3. The raw and\ncorrected event average transverse energies are ET = 7.350 \u00b1 0.001(stat.) and ET = 10.4 \u00b1\n0.2(stat.) \u00b1 0.7(syst.) GeV, respectively.\nThe measurement of the event transverse energy sum is new to the field, and represents a\nfirst attempt at describing the full final state including neutral particles. In this regard, it is complementary to the charged particle measurement in describing the global features of the inelastic\npp\u0304 cross section.\n\ufffd\n\nd3\u03c3/dE Td\u03b7d\u03c6 [mb/GeV]\n\nThe PYTHIA simulation does not closely reproduce the data over the whole ET spectrum.

The ratio of\n\ndata to PYTHIA Tune A is shown in the lower plot.\n\n3.5\n\nSystematic Uncertainties\n\nWe have detected several possible sources of systematic uncertainties. The largest ones are the\n\ufffd\nuncertainties on the calorimeter response (up to 15% at lower ET ), on the pile-up correction,\nMPI08\n\n81\n\n\fon the diffractive background, and the uncertainty related to the MC generator used to compute\n\ufffd\nthe various corrections. These uncertainties are, in general, larger in the ET measurement than\nin charged particle measurements.\nThere is an overall global 6% systematic uncertainty on the effective time-integrated luminosity measurement [11] that is to be added to all the cross section measurements.\n4 Experimentl Hot Topics\n4.1\n\nThe MB trigger\n\nThe acceptance of the MB trigger has been measured by comparing it to a sample of zero-bias\nevents collected during the same period. The zero-bias data set is collected without any trigger\nrequirements, simply by starting the data acquisition at the Tevatron radio-frequency signal. The\nresults indicate that the acceptance depends on a number of variables, most of which are, in some\nway, related to the number of tracks present in the detector: number of interactions, number of\ntracks, instantaneous luminosity and the CLC calibration. We parametrized the dependence on\nthese variables so that a correction could be applied on an event-by-event basis. The total trigger\nacceptance therefore increases linearly with the instantaneous luminosity. As a function of the\nreconstructed number of tracks, the acceptance is well represented by a typical turn-on curve\nstarting at about 20% (few tracks) and reaching its plateau with a value between 97 and 99% for\nabout 15 tracks.\n4.2\n\nPile Up\n\n< Nch >\n\nIn spite of the low instantaneous luminosity, the selected data sample contains a contamination\nof pile-up events. This is due to multiple interactions when the separation between pp\u0304 collisions\nis less than the vertex resolution in the z\u2212coordinate (about 3 cm).\n6\n5.5\n\nCDF Run II Preliminary\n\n5\n4.5\n4\n3.5\n3\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90 \u00d7 10\n\n30\n\nInst. Lum. [cm-2s-1]\n\nFig. 4: The raw event average charged particle multiplicity as a function of the instantaneous luminosity. The line\nrepresents a linear fit (with slope equal to 0.0022\u00b10.0003). The uncertainty is statistical only.\n\nThe number of undetected events was estimated indirectly by plotting the average Nch\nas a function of the instantaneous luminosity (Fig. 4). In this plot, the increase in \ufffdNch \ufffd is\ndue to the increase in number of pile-up events. We assume that virtually no pile-up is present\nat a luminosity of L = 1 \u00d7 1030 cm\u22122 s\u22121 . The difference with respect to the \ufffdNch \ufffd at the\naverage luminosity of the sample yields the estimated number of events that went unobserved.\n82\n\nMPI08\n\n\fHowever, although the pile-up probability in the low luminosity sample is small (< 1%), it is not\nnegligible. By assuming conservatively an uncertainty on the MB inelastic-non-diffractive cross\nsection used by the MC generator of 6 mb, we calculate that this is equivalent to a variation in the\nsample average luminosity of 2.5 \u00d7 1030 cm\u22122 s\u22121 . This, in turn, corresponds to an uncertainty\n\ufffd\n< 3% on the ET distribution and negligible on the charged particle distributions.\n5 Conclusions\nA set of high precision measurements of the final state in minimum-bias interactions is provided\nand compared to the best available MC model.\nThe former power-law modeling of the single particle pT spectrum is not compatible with\nthe high momentum tail (pT \u2265 10 GeV/c) observed in data. The more recent tunings of the\nPYTHIA MC generator (Tune A) reproduce the inclusive charged particle pT distribution in data\nwithin 10% up to pT \ufffd 20 GeV/c but the prediction lies below the data at high pT .\n\ufffd\n\nThe ET cross section represents the first attempt to measure the neutral particle activity\nin MB. PYTHIA Tune A does not closely reproduce the shape of the distribution.\n\nThe mechanism of multiple parton interactions (with strong final-state correlations among\nthem) has been shown to be very useful in order to reproduce high multiplicity final states with\nthe correct particle transverse momenta. In fact, the data very much disfavor models without\nMPI, and put strong constraints on multiple-parton interaction models.\nThe data presented here can be used to improve QCD Monte Carlo models and further our\nunderstanding of multiple parton interactions. A detailed understanding of MB interactions is\nespecially important in very high luminosity environments (such as at the LHC) where a large\nnumber of such interactions is expected in the same bunch crossing.\nReferences\n[1] P.

Event samples\nwith enriched direct- or resolved-photon events are selected by measuring the photon energy fraction entering in the hard scattering, xobs\n\u03b3 .\nThis allows the study of the Underlying Event (UE) and Multiple Parton Interactions (MPI) with a new strategy not possible at hadron colliders. The H1 collaboration studied photoproduction events with at\nleast two jets with PTjets > 5 GeV. The highest transverse momentum\njet (leading jet) defines four regions in azimuth: the toward region, defined by the leading jet, the away region, in the opposite hemisphere\nand two transverse regions between them, where a measurement of the\ncharged particle multiplicity is performed and compared to models.\n1 Introduction\nThe Underlying Event (UE) can be defined as everything in addition to the lowest order process.\nIn ep collisions at HERA the mediator boson is a virtual photon. If the virtuality is high\nthe photon interacts as a point-like particle (direct). At low virtualities the photon may fluctuate\ninto a quark-antiquark pair and even develop a hadronic structure. In this case, a parton from the\nphoton interacts with a parton from the proton and only a fraction of the energy from the photon\n(resolved) enters in the hard scattering 2 . At HERA, these events can be selected by measuring\nthe photon energy fraction entering in the hard scattering, xobs\n\u03b3 .\nMonte Carlo programs (MC) simulate ep collisions with a 2-to-2 parton scattering in leading order \u03b1s . For direct photoproduction, xobs\n\u03b3 > 0.7, boson-gluon fusion is the most important\ncontribution to dijet production. In the event generation, initial and final state parton radiation\nand the contributions from the proton remnant are simulated. Hadronisation models are applied\nto produce colourless particles. In this picture, the primary two hard partons lead to two jets\nwhile the other parton emissions constitute the underlying event.\nRemnant-remnant interactions are only present when both interacting particles have a composite structure. This can happen for resolved photon events, xobs\n< 0.7, via multi-parton in\u03b3\nteractions (MPI). By definition, these MPI are part of the UE. Therefore, selecting events with\n1\n2\n\n84\n\nFor the virtuality range considered here.\nThe distinction between direct and resolved is only unambiguously defined at leading order.\n\nMPI08\n\n\fdirect (resolved) photons allows to exclude (include) MPI from the UE. This is an advantage of\na lepton-hadron collider compared to a hadron-hadron collider.\nAt HERA, three- and four-jet events have been studied [1] for different n-jet invariant mass\nregions. Comparisons with O(\u03b1\u03b1s ) matrix element MC programs supplemented with parton\nshowers and with a O(\u03b1\u03b12s ) calculation show that the corrections due to MPI are needed in order\nto describe the data. The corrections from MPI are higher for low values of the invariant mass of\nthe jets.\nThe description of MPI in particular and in general of the UE is very important for the LHC\nphysics: Higgs searches and multi-jet analyses like for the top quark require a proper description\nof the underlying QCD aspects. Different MPI models and parton dynamics approaches, however, give very different predictions at higher energies [2]. The strategy presented here consists of\nseparating the point-like from the resolved contributions, i.e. events with only one remnant from\nthose with two remnants where MPI are possible. The ep collisions at HERA offer a cleaner environment to study MPI. They can be better separated from the rest of the UE (parton dynamics,\nhadronisation, etc) compared to hadron colliders.\n2 Charged particle multiplicity in photoproduction\nMPI and its contribution to the UE were studied by the H1 collaboration [3, 4] using dijet photoproduction. Events with Q2 < 0.01 GeV2 and 0.3 < y < 0.65 were selected. The jets\nwere defined applying the inclusive kt -jet cluster algorithm [5] in the laboratory frame. The jets\nwere required to have transverse momentum PTjets > 5 GeV and pseudo-rapidity |\u03b7 jets | < 1.5.\nWithin these events, charged particles with transverse momenta PTtrack > 150 MeV in the range\n|\u03b7 track | < 1.5 were selected.\nThe analysis procedure, inspired by the CDF collaboration [6], is the following:\n\nFour regions in the azimuthal angle, \u03c6, were defined with respect to the leading jet as\nindicated in figure 1. The leading jet defines the azimuthal angle, \u03c6 = 0. The region |\u03c6| < 60\u25e6\nis defined as the toward region and is expected to contain all particles from the leading jet. The\naway region is defined by |\u03c6| > 120\u25e6 which often contains the second leading jet and most of its\nparticles to balance the transverse momentum in the event. In the transverse regions, 60 \u25e6 < |\u03c6| <\n120\u25e6 , the contribution from the primary collision is usually small and thus the effects from the\nUE should be most visible.\nIn the transverse regions, a high activity and a low activity region are defined event by\nevent depending on which region contains the higher scalar sum of the transverse momentum of\n\ufffd\ncharged particles, PTsum = tracks\nPTi . The high activity region is more affected by higher order\ni\nQCD contributions than the low activity region by definition: if higher order radiation is emitted\nthis will increase the PTsum in that transverse hemisphere.\nThe average charged particle multiplicity, \ufffdNcharged \ufffd, as a function of the transverse momentum of the leading jet, PTJet1 , for the different azimuthal regions is shown in figures 2-5. The\nmeasurement is performed for resolved and a direct photon enriched events, i.e. xobs\n\u03b3 < 0.7 and\nobs\nx\u03b3 > 0.7, respectively.\nThe \ufffdNcharged \ufffd distributions are corrected to the level of charged stable hadrons using\nMPI08\n\n85\n\n\fThe Leading Jet\n\nToward\n\nRegion\n\n\u03c6\u2217 = 60\n\nTransverse\nRegion\n\nTransverse\nRegion\n\nHigh activity\nRegion\n\nLow activity\nRegion\n\n\u03c6\u2217 = 120\nAway Region\n\nThe Subleading Jet\nFig. 1: Definition of the four azimuthal regions.

They are compared to two MC predictions:\nPYTHIA [8] and CASCADE [9, 10], both implement leading order in \u03b1s matrix elements. The\nmatrix elements are supplemented with initial and final state radiation according to the DGLAP\nevolution equations in PYTHIA and the ones of CCFM in CASCADE . In PYTHIA a model of MPI\nis available for ep collisions. CASCADE uses unintegrated gluon density functions (updf) and\noff-shell matrix elements. It does not include the resolved component of the photon and has not\nmodel for MPI implemented. In PYTHIA the CTEQ 6L [11] pdf was used while in CASCADE set2\nand set3 [12] were used.\nIn the toward and away regions \ufffdNcharged \ufffd increases with the PTJet1 by about 30% from the\nlowest to the highest PTJet1 bin. On the contrary, in the transverse regions the multiplicity tends\nto decrease although the effect is much weaker. In the toward regions the particle multiplicity is\nslightly higher than in the away regions but in the transverse high activity regions the multiplicity\nis much higher than in the low activity regions. The multiplicity is higher for resolved enriched\nthan for direct enriched events.\nIn figures 2 and 3 the data are compared to different MC predictions in the toward and\naway regions. The PYTHIA MC describes data quite well if contributions from MPI are included\nin the simulation (figure 2). The contributions from MPI decrease as PTJet1 grows according to\nthis model. The CASCADE MC describes the data fairly well. For direct enhanced events, xobs\n\u03b3 >\nobs\n0.7, CASCADE describes the data perfectly. For resolved enhanced events, x\u03b3 < 0.7, however,\nthe predicted multiplicity is lower than in data, especially at low PTJet1 .\nFigures 4 and 5 show a comparison between data and the MC predictions in the transverse\nregions. Like in the toward and away regions, including MPI improves the description of the\ndata in all bins for PYTHIA 3 .

However, they somewhat underestimate the data in the resolved enriched transverse regions. Here, the shape predicted by PYTHIA + MPI follows the data\ndistribution, although the absolute value of the multiplicity is slightly too low. CASCADE predicts an even lower multiplicity in these regions but it is much better than PYTHIA without MPI,\nalthough CASCADE does not include a resolved component and any MPI model. The description of CASCADE is better in the high activity region, where higher order corrections are more\nimportant, than in the low activity region, which is expected to be most sensitive to MPI. These\ndiscrepancies decrease with increasing PTJet1 .\n3 Conclusion\nThe average charged particle multiplicity in dijet photoproduction has been measured as a function of PTJet1 in four regions of the azimuthal angle \u03c6: the toward, away, transverse high and\nlow activity regions. The data have been investigated for enhanced photon point-like interactions\nwith the proton events and enhanced photon resolved events. The data have been compared to\npredictions of the PYTHIA and CASCADE MC generators.\nPYTHIA without MPI does not produce enough particles, especially at low xobs\n\u03b3 and in the\ntransverse regions. Including MPI leads to a good description of the data.\nobs\nCASCADE provides a good description of the data in the high xobs\n\u03b3 regions. In the low x\u03b3\nregions it produces too few particles, especially in the low activity region.\n\nCASCADE describes the data better than PYTHIA without MPI both at low xobs\n\u03b3 and at high\nwhere contributions from MPI are smaller. The discrepancies of CASCADE with the data\nin the high activity region are smaller than in the low activity region, the former is expected to\nbe more sensitive to higher orders and the later to MPI. This points to a possible better parton\ndynamics approach in CASCADE which could be important in the determination of the amount of\nMPI. Reducing the amount of MPI needed to describe the data, by improving the parton dynamics\nin the pQCD regime, would reduce the theoretical uncertainty for the description of MPI. This\nwould have important benefits for physics predictions at LHC energies.\nxobs\n\u03b3 ,\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work has been partially supported by the Spanish Consolider-Ingenio 2010 Programme\nCPAN (CSD2007-00042).\nReferences\n[1] ZEUS Collaboration, S.

The plans of the CMS collaboration to measure cross sections and\ndifferential yields of charged particles (unidentified or identified) and\nneutrals produced in inelastic p-p collisions at 14 TeV are presented.\nThe tracking of charged particles will be possible down to about 100\nMeV/c, with good efficiency and negligible fake rate. The yield of\ncharged kaons and protons can be extracted for total momenta below\n0.8 and 1.5 GeV/c, respectively. Comparisons of the results to theoretical models are also discussed.\n1 Introduction\nThe CMS experiment at the LHC is a general purpose detector designed to explore physics at\nthe TeV energy scale [6, 8]. It has a large acceptance and hermetic coverage. The various subdetectors are: a silicon tracker with pixels and strips (|\u03b7| < 2.4); electromagnetic (|\u03b7| < 3) and\nhadronic (|\u03b7| < 5) calorimeters; and muon chambers (|\u03b7| < 2.4) [5]. The acceptance is further\nextended with forward detectors: CASTOR (5.2 < |\u03b7| < 6.6) and Zero Degree Calorimeters\n(|\u03b7neutrals | > 8.3). CMS detects leptons and both charged and neutral hadrons. This example\nanalysis uses 2 million inelastic p-p collisions. They have been generated by the PYTHIA event\ngenerator [10].\n2 Minimum bias triggers\nIn case of very low initial intensity the events can be taken by a special high level trigger, requiring at least one or two reconstructed tracks in the pixel detector. This trigger has very low\nbias and an efficiency of about 88% for inelastic p-p collisions. Another type of trigger will be\nbased on counting towers, with energy above the detector noise level, in both forward hadronic\ncalorimeters (HF, 3 < |\u03b7| < 5). A minimal number of hits (1, 2 or 3) will be required on one or\non both sides [3]. The efficiency of this single-sided trigger for inelastic p-p collisions is about\n89%. The double-sided trigger is less efficient (about 59%), but it is also less sensitive to beamgas background (Fig. 1-left). Once the luminosity is high enough, events can also be taken with\nthe so called zero-bias trigger based on a random clock each bunch crossing.\n\u2020\n\nspeaker\n\nMPI08\n\n91\n\n\f6\n\ndNch/d\u03b7\n\n1 dNch\nN event d \u03b7\n\np+p - \u221as = 14TeV\n\nCMS preliminary\n\npythia simulation\nminimum bias collisions\n\nFixed Target (7TeV)\nhijing 1.383 simulation\np+O\np+p\n\n5\n4\n\nHF region\n\n4\n\nSim. dNch/d\u03b7\n\n3\n\nRec. dNch/d\u03b7, 1. layer\nRec. dNch/d\u03b7, 2. layer\n\n2\n\n2\n\nRec. dNch/d\u03b7, 3. layer\n\n1\ns=14 TeV\n\n0\n\n-10\n\np(7TeV)\n\n0\n\nO(0TeV)\n\nglobal syst. around 7%\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u03b7\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\nCMS Preliminary\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\u03b7\n\nFig. 1: Left: The number of charged particles per unit pseudo-rapidity for minimum bias collisions compared to beam\ngas collisions occurring at the center of the detector. Right: Charged particle dNch /d\u03b7 distributions from generated\n(histogram) and reconstructed (symbols) p-p events at 14 TeV. Error bars show the statistical errors corresponding to\n5000 events.\n\n3 Charged particle rapidity density\nCharged hadrons with pT larger than 30 MeV/c can leave hits in the layers of the pixel detector.\nIts fine segmentation and small occupancies allow for the measurement of the \u03b7 distribution of\ncharged hadrons by counting the number of reconstructed hits [2]. With help of the length of\nthe pixel hit clusters in beam direction, the position of the interaction vertex can be estimated.\nIt also helps to remove background hits at higher \u03b7 if their size is incompatible with the found\nvertex position. The number of detected hits has to be corrected for non-primary origin: looping\nparticles, secondaries, decay products. A systematic error of 7% is expected (Fig. 1-right). The\nmethod is attractive since it does not need particle tracking and it is insensitive to the alignment\nof the tracker.\n4 Charged particle spectra, particle identification\nBoth pixel and strip silicon tracker detectors are used for the reconstruction of charged particles. With a modified hit triplet finding algorithm the pixel detector can be employed for the\nreconstruction of low pT charged particles [1, 8, 9]. The acceptance of the method extends down\nto 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 GeV/c in pT for pions, kaons and protons, respectively. The obtained pixel\ntracks are used for finding and fitting the primary vertex or vertices [4, 6, 7]. The found vertices\nare reused, ensuring that the track comes from an interaction point. This brings the fake track\nrate down to per mille levels. The measured shape of tracker hits is compared to the dimensions\npredicted from the local direction of the trajectory. This filter helps to eliminate incompatible trajectory candidates at an early stage. At the end, the trajectory is refitted with the primary vertex\nconstraint.\nThe hadron spectra are corrected for particles of non-primary origin.

While the correction is around 2% for pions,\nit can go up to 15% for protons with pT \u2248 0.3 GeV/c. The resonances K0S , \u039b and \u039b can be\nextracted from the measured data.\nCharged particles can be singly identified or their yields can be extracted (identification in\nthe statistical sense) using deposited energy in the pixel and strip silicon tracker, with help of the\ntruncated mean estimator [1]. The distribution of log dE/dx can be successfully fitted in slices of\nmomentum. The fit function is a sum of properly scaled Gaussians for each particle species: here\npions, kaons and protons are assumed. The relative resolution of dE/dx for tracks with average\nnumber of hits (\u223c15) is around 5-7%. The yield of kaons can be extracted if p < 0.8 GeV/c and\nthat of protons if p < 1.5 GeV/c. Both limits correspond to approximately 3\u03c3 separation.\nThe measured invariant yields of charged hadrons are shown in Fig. 2-left, as a function\nof pT , in narrow \u03b7 bins. (Results refer to the sum of positively and negatively charged particles.\nSymmetric positive and negative \u03b7 bins are also added.) Measured differential yields of identified\ncharged pions and protons are shown in Fig. 2-right. The obtained invariant yields were fitted\nby the Tsallis function [11], a function that successfully combines and describes both the low pT\nexponential and the high pT power-law behaviors. The pseudorapidity distribution of charged\nhadrons is shown in Fig. 3-left. The energy dependence of some measured quantities can also be\nstudied (Fig. 3-right).

Using charged\nparticle and charged particle jets, it will be possible to discriminate between various QCD models with different multiple parton interaction\nschemes, which correctly reproduce Tevatron data but give different\npredictions when extrapolated to the LHC energy. This will permit improving and tuning Monte Carlo models at LHC start-up, and opens\nprospects for exploring QCD dynamics in proton-proton collisions at\n14TeV.\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nFrom a theoretical point of view, the underlying event (UE) in a hadron-hadron interaction is\ndefined as all particle production accompanying the hard scattering component of the collision.\nFrom an experimental point of view, it is impossible to separate these two components. However,\nthe topological structure of hadron-hadron collisions can be used to define physics observables\nwhich are sensitive to the UE. The ability to properly identify and calculate the UE activity, and\nin particular the contribution from Multiple Parton Interactions MPI [1], has direct implications\nfor other measurements at the LHC. This work is devoted to the analysis of the sensitivity of UE\nobservables, as measured by CMS [2], to different QCD models which describe well the Tevatron UE data but largely differ when extrapolated to the LHC energy. MPI are implemented in\nthe PYTHIA simulations [3], for which the following tunes are considered: tune DW (reproducing the CDF Run-1 Z boson transverse momentum distribution [4]), tune DWT (with a different\nMPI energy dependence parametrization [5]) and tune S0 (which uses the new multiple interaction model implemented in PYTHIA [6]). In addition, an Herwig [7] simulation has also been\nperformed, providing a useful reference to a model without multiple interactions.\n2\n\nAnalysis strategy\n\nSignificant progress in the phenomenological study of the UE in jet events has been achieved\nby the CDF experiment at the Tevatron [8, 9]. In the present work, plans are discussed to study\nthe topological structure of hadron-hadron collisions and the UE at the LHC, using only charged\nparticle multiplicity and momentum densities in charged particle jets. A charged particle jet (referred to as a charged jet from now on) is defined using charged particles only, with no recourse\n\u2020\n\n96\n\nspeaker\n\nMPI08\n\n\fto calorimeter information. The direction of the leading charged jet, which in most cases results\nfrom the hard scattering, is used to isolate different hadronic activity regions in the \u03b7-\u03c6 space and\nto study correlations in the azimuthal angle \u03c6. The plane transverse to the jet direction is where\nthe 2-to-2 hard scattering has the smallest influence and, therefore, where the UE contributions\nare easier to observe. In order to combine measurements with different leading charged jet energies, events are selected with a Minimum Bias (MB) trigger [10] and with three triggers based\non the transverse momentum of the leading calorimetric jet ( PTcalo > 20, 60 and 120 GeV/c).\nCharged jets are reconstructed with an iterative cone algorithm with radius R = 0.5, using charged\nparticles emitted in the central detector \ufffd\nregion |\u03b7| < 2. Two variables allow evaluating charged\njet performances: the distance \u2206R = \u2206\u03c62 + \u2206\u03b7 2 between the leading charged jet and the\nleading calorimetric jet, and the ratio of their transverse momenta PT (transverse momenta are\ndefined with respect to the beam axis). The transverse momentum of the leading charged jet is\nused to define the hard scale of the event.\nFigure 1 presents, for the different trigger streams used , the density dN/d\u03b7d\u03c6 of the\ncharged particle multiplicity and the density dpsum\nT /d\u03b7d\u03c6 of the total charged particle transverse\nsum\nmomentum pT , as a function of the azimuthal distance to the leading charged jet. Enhanced\nactivity is observed around the jet direction, in the \"toward\" region (\ufffd 0 degrees from the jet\ndirection), together with a corresponding rise in the \"away\" region (\ufffd 180 degrees), due to the\nrecoiling jet. The \"transverse\" region (\ufffd \u00b1 90 degrees) is characterized by a lower activity and\nalmost flat density distributions, as expected.\n3\n3.1\n\nUE observable measurement\nTracking\n\nTracks of charged particles with pT > 0.9 GeV/c are reconstructed in CMS following the procedure described in [11]. The possibility to build the UE observables using tracks with pT > 0.5\nGeV/c enhances sensitivity to the differences between the models. The standard CMS tracking\nalgorithm was, thus, adapted to a 0.5 GeV/c threshold, by decreasing the pT cut of the seeds\nand of the trajectory builder, and adapting other parameters of the trajectory reconstruction to\noptimize performance.\n3.2\n\nResults on density measurements\n\nsum are\nThe densities dN/d\u03b7d\u03c6 of charged particle multiplicity and dpsum\nT /d\u03b7d\u03c6 of charged pT\npresented in Figure2 for the toward region and in Figure3 for the transverse region. The data,\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of 10 pb\u22121 , are presented at the reconstruction level,\nusing the DWT tune. In the toward region, the expected strong correlation between the transverse\nmomentum of the charged jet and the charged psum\ndensity is clearly visible. In the transverse\nT\nregion, two contributions to the hadronic activity can be identified: a fast saturation of the UE\ndensities for charged jets with PT < 20 GeV/c, and a smooth rise for PT > 40 GeV/c. The latter\nis due to initial and final state radiation, which increases with the hard scale of the event. In Figure\n4, the ratio between generated and reconstructed UE observables is presented as a function of the\ncharged jet PT , for simulations performed with the PYTHIA DWT tune and the pT > 0.9 GeV/c\ntracking reconstruction parameter set. The average corrections for both the PT scale and the UE\n\nMPI08\n\n97\n\n\fobservables are found to be independent of the particular model used for the simulations. Figure 5\npresents the predictions for the transverse activity, as obtained using the PYTHIA DWT tune and\ncorrected following the results of Figure 4. The statistical precision and the alignment conditions\ncorrespond to those achieved with an integrated luminosity of 100 pb\u22121 . The curves represent\nthe predictions of the different PYTHIA (DW, DWT and S0 tunes) and HERWIG simulations.\nLowering the pT threshold for track reconstruction to 0.5 GeV/c leads to an increase of about\n50% of the charged particle multiplicity and of about 30% of the charged transverse momentum\ndensity. As shown in Figure 6, this enhances the discrimination power between the different\nmodels in the charged jet PT region below 40 GeV/c, where the differences between models are\nexpected to be the largest. This is particularly clear when comparing the DWT and S0 tunes.\n3.3\n\nResults using observable ratios\n\nThe ratios between (uncorrected) UE density observables in the transverse region, for charged\nparticles with pT > 0.9 GeV/c and with pT > 1.5 GeV/c, are presented in Figure 7, for an\nintegrated luminosity of 100 pb\u22121 . Ratios are shown here as obtained after track reconstruction,\nwithout applying additional reconstruction corrections; given the uniform performance of track\nreconstruction, the ratios presented here at detector level are similar to those at generator level.\nThese ratios show a significant sensitivity to differences between different MPI models, thus\nproviding a feasible (and original) investigation method.\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nThe predictions on the amount of hadronic activity in the region transverse to the jets produced\nin proton-proton interactions at the LHC energies are based on extrapolations from lower energy\ndata (mostly from the Tevatron). These extrapolations are uncertain and predictions differ significantly among model parameterisations. It is thus important to measure the UE activity at the\nLHC as soon as possible, and to compare those measurements with Tevatron data. This will lead\nto a better understanding of the QCD dynamics and to improvements of QCD based Monte Carlo\nmodels aimed at describing ordinary events at the LHC, an extremely important ingredient for\nnew physics searches. Variables well suited for studying the UE structure and to discriminate\nbetween models are the densities dN/d\u03b7d\u03c6 of charged particle multiplicity and dpsum\nT /d\u03b7d\u03c6 of\nsum\ntotal charged particle transverse momentum pT , in charged particle jets. An original approach\nis proposed, by taking the ratio of these variables for different charged particle pT thresholds.\nWith 10 pb\u22121 and a partially calibrated detector, it will be possible to control systematic uncertainties on the UE observables, to keep them at the level of the statistical errors and to perform a\nfirst discrimination between UE models. Extending the statistics to 100 pb\u22121 and exploiting the\nuniform performance of track reconstruction for pT > 1.5 GeV/c and pT > 0.9 GeV/c, the ratio\nof observables will probe more subtle differences between models.\nReferences\n[1] T.

Hadron-level studies are performed with\nthe new event generators P YTHIA 8 and H ERWIG ++.\n1\n\nSignatures for Double High-pT Scatters at Hadron Colliders\n\nThe production of four high-pT jets is the most prominent process to directly study the impact\nof multiple interactions: Two independent scatters in the same pp or pp\u0304 collision (double-parton\nscattering, DPS) each produce two jets. Such a signature has been searched for by the AFS\nexperiment at the CERN ISR, by the UA2 experiment at the CERN Sp\u0304pS and most recently by\nthe CDF experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron [1].\nSearches for double-parton\nscattering in four-jet events at\nhadron colliders face significant backgrounds from other\nsources of jet production, in\nparticular from QCD bremsstrahlung (Fig. 1-left). Typical\nthresholds employed in jet triggers bias the event sample towards hard scatterings. However, a high-pT jet parton is\nmore likely to radiate additional partons, thus producing\nfurther jets. Thus, the relative\nfraction of jets from final-state Fig. 1: CDF definition of azimuthal angle between pairs, together with typshowers above a given thresh- ical configurations of double-bremsstrahlung (left) and double-parton scatold is enlarged in jet trigger tering events (right).\nstreams which is an unwanted\nbias. On the other hand, looking for four jets in a minimum-bias stream will yield little statistics.\nIn a novel approach to detect double-parton scattering, the CDF collaboration therefore studied\nfinal states with one photon and three jets looking for pairwise balanced photon-jet and dijet\ncombinations [2]. The data sample was selected with the CDF experiment's inclusive photon\ntrigger, thereby avoiding a bias on the jet energy. The superior energy resolution of photons\nMPI08\n\n103\n\n\fcompared to jets purifies the identification of ET balanced pairs. CDF found an excess in pairs\nthat are uncorrelated in azimuth with respect to the predictions from models without several\nhard parton scatters per proton-proton scatter. CDF interpreted this result as an observation of\ndouble-parton-scatters.\nAnalyses trying to identify two hard scatters in multi-jet events typically rely on methods\nto overcome combinatorics as there are three possible ways to group four objects into two pairs:\nCombinations are commonly selected pairwisely balanced in azimuth and energy. As an alternative, a final state without the need for pT balancing is of great interest to searches for two hard\nscatters. One example of such a final state, that would not need pT balancing, are events with\ntwo b jets together with two additional jets [3]. In this case, one pair would be composed of the\ntwo b jets, and one pair would be composed of the two additional jets.\nIn order to discriminate double-parton scatters against double-bremsstrahlung events, we\nstudy prompt-photon events with additional jets coming from multiple interactions, from the\nparton shower, or from both. Observables \u2206\u03c6(\u2212) , employed by AFS, and \u2206\u03c6(+) , employed by\nCDF, probe the azimuthal angle between photon-jet pair and dijet pair (Fig. 1):\n\u2206\u03c6(\u2212) = \ufffd\n\u2206\u03c6(+) = \ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\np\ufffdT\u03b3 \u2212 p\ufffdT1 , p\ufffdT2 \u2212 p\ufffdT3\n\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\np\ufffdT\u03b3 + p\ufffdT1 , p\ufffdT2 + p\ufffdT3\n\n\ufffd\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere p\ufffdT1 stands for the transverse momentum of the jet combined with the photon, and the\nphoton-jet pair is selected such that the term\n|\ufffd\npT\u03b3 + p\ufffdTi |2\n|\ufffd\npTj + p\ufffdTk |2\n+\n|\ufffd\npT\u03b3 | + |\ufffd\npTi | |\ufffd\npTj | + |\ufffd\npTk |\n\n(3)\n\nis minimized. Thus, pairs are assigned based on pairwise pT balance. Additional jets produced\nin double-bremsstrahlung typically point away from the photon and surround the jet balancing\nthe photon. Expectations for the above described variables are therefore \u2206\u03c6(\u2212) \u2248 \u03c0/2 and\n\u2206\u03c6(+) \u2248 \u03c0 if additional jets come from double-Bremsstrahlung. Otherwise, i. e. if additional\njets come from multiple interactions, both variables should be distributed uniformly.\n2\n\nSimulation of Multiple Scatters\n\nHadron-level studies have been carried out employing the parton shower programs P YTHIA [4],\nversion 8.108, and H ERWIG ++ [5], version 2.2.0, which both implement new models for multiple\nparton-parton scatters in non-diffractive events1 .\nMain features of P YTHIA's multiple interaction framework are p\u22a5 -ordering and interleaving, small-p\u22a5 -dampening of perturbative QCD cross sections, variable impact parameters, and\nrescaling of parton density distributions [6]. The model is currently being expanded to include\nthe simulation of parton rescattering [7]. H ERWIG simulates multiple scatters that are not ordered\nand not interleaved with parton showering [8]. At small transverse momenta p\u22a5 , no dampening\nbut a sharp cutoff on additional interactions is imposed. The matter distribution inside the proton follows the electromagnetic form factor, where the hadron radius is kept as a free parameter.\n1\n\nIn the remainder of this article, P YTHIA refers to P YTHIA 8.108 and H ERWIG refers to H ERWIG ++ 2.2.0.\n\n104\n\nMPI08\n\n\fTable 1: CDF selection of photon-three-jet events together with a suggested extrapolation to LHC energies.\n\nPhoton\n\nJets\n\nCDF\n|\u03b7| \u2264 1.1\nET \u2265 16 GeV\nCone R = 0.7\n|\u03b7| \u2264 4.2\nET \u2265 5 GeV\nET 4 < 5 GeV\nET 2 , ET 3 < 7 GeV\n\nLHC extrapolation\n|\u03b7| \u2264 2.5\nET \u2265 50 GeV\nk\u22a5 D = 0.4\n|\u03b7| \u2264 5\nET \u2265 20 GeV\nET 4 < 10 GeV\nET 2 , ET 3 < 30 GeV\n\nParton densities are not modified except for the exclusion valence contributions.

Table 1 summarizes the kinematic selection on photon\nand jets as imposed by CDF [2] together with a suggested extrapolation of these cuts to LHC energies [10]. The suggested thresholds follow the CMS detector's acceptance [11], but should\nmerely be seen as a first approximation to a final event selection. The threshold choices are\nmotivated in the following. The polar acceptances of the CMS electromagnetic and hadronic\ncalorimeters are reflected in pseudorapidity cuts of |\u03b7(\u03b3)| \u2264 2.5 and |\u03b7(jet)| \u2264 5. Photon transverse energies are required to be above ET (photon) > 50 GeV, jet transverse energies have to\nbe above ET (jet) > 20 GeV, in order to ensure a sufficient purity in reconstruction [11]. Three\nP YTHIA settings are studied:\nDefault: P YTHIA is used \"out-of-the-box\". Parton showers and multiple interactions are included in the event selection.\nMI: The simulation of parton showers is switched off. Additional jets are produced exclusively\nby the multiple interaction framework.\nShower: Multiple interactions are switched off. Additional jets come from initial- or final-state\nradiation.\nIn the following, all comparisons between P YTHIA and H ERWIG are carried out using P YTHIA\nDefault settings and H ERWIG with its default underlying event tune. Specifically, the simulations\nof multiple interactions and parton showers are switched on.\nDifferential cross section shape predictions for the variable suggested by AFS, \u2206\u03c6(\u2212) , are\nshown in Fig. 2.

With multiple interactions\nswitched off, \u2206\u03c6(\u2212) is indeed most likely to be \u2206\u03c6(\u2212) \u2248 \u03c0/2. However, the correlation is weak\nwith a factor of 3 between first bin and last bin, i. e. between events with both pairs being aligned\nin azimuth and events being orthogonal in azimuth. In fact, the difference between P YTHIA's\nDefault and Shower scenarios is not significant within the available statistics (Fig. 2-right). Yet,\nboth pairs are more or less uncorrelated if additional jets come from multiple interactions (MI\nscenario, Fig. 2-right).\nDifferential cross section shape predictions for the variable suggested by CDF, \u2206\u03c6(+) ,\nare shown in Fig. 3. Differences between H ERWIG and P YTHIA are especially pronounced for\nsmall \u2206\u03c6(+) , corresponding to the photon-jet pair and the dijet pair both pointing in the same\ndirection in azimuth (Fig. 3-left). P YTHIA predicts a larger fraction of uncorrelated pairs than\nH ERWIG does. Strong differences can also be seen when comparing P YTHIA's different simulation scenarios with each other (Fig. 3-right). As noted before, jets from initial- or final-state\nshowers dominantly point away from the photon and combinations with small \u2206\u03c6(+) are largely\nsuppressed. However, if additional jets come from multiple interactions (MI scenario), the dijet\npair can have any orientation with respect to the photon-jet pair, thus the predicted distribution is\napproximately flat. This large difference between the several simulation scenarios makes \u2206\u03c6(+)\na promising observable to search for double-parton-scattering.\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have studied a possible approach to identifying double-parton scatters in proton-proton interactions.

Note the logarithmic scale.\n\nP YTHIA can in part be attributed to different default choices of parton densities in both programs.\nHowever, in some observables, both models yield clearly different differential predictions, most\nnotably with respect to the \u2206\u03c6(+) variable put forward by CDF. It should be noted, however,\nthat the imposed selection cuts were only a first approximation to an extrapolation to the LHC.\nMore studies will be needed to find the optimal selection cuts and to assess their experimental\nfeasibility. The one-dimensional variables under study try to describe correlations in four-object\nfinal states. This is likely to be a too simplistic approach and higher-dimensional observables\nmight perform better to extract a double-parton-scattering signal at the LHC.\nIn addition, this analysis is one of the first to use the new event generators H ERWIG ++ and\nP YTHIA 8 that will become standard in the near future. Further tests are foreseen, in particular\nof the underlying event predictions of both models.\nAcknowledgments\nThe author acknowledges financial support by the Marie Curie Fellowship program for Early\nStage Research Training, by MCnet (contract number MRTN-CT-2006-035606) and by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).\nReferences\n[1] Axial Field Spectrometer Collaboration, T.

Bell on behalf of the ATLAS Collaboration\nUniversit\u00e9 de Gen\u00e8ve, Section de Physique, 24 rue Ernest Ansermet, CH-1211 Geneve 4\nAbstract\nThis paper presents the status of Minimum Bias physics analysis with\nthe ATLAS detector [1]. The current uncertainties in modelling soft\np-p inelastic collisions at LHC energies are discussed in the context of\nprimary charged track measurements. The selection and reconstruction\nof inelastic p-p interactions with the ATLAS detector at the LHC is\ndiscussed. The charged track reconstruction performance is explored\nusing a GEANT4 [2] simulation of the ATLAS detector.\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe properties of inelastic proton-proton and proton anti-proton interactions have previously\nbeen studied over a wide range of energies [3\u201312]. Previous analyses have selected events with\nminimal bias and illustrated their behaviour through dNCh /d\u03b7, dNCh /dpT , KNO scaling [13],\nand \ufffdpT \ufffd vs NCh distributions. These distributions are typically produced from a selection of\nnon-single-diffractive events, defined as a sample of inelastic events, where the trigger acceptance\nfor single diffractive events is very low. Previous results from CERN and Fermilab experiments\nhave been used to tune [14] the PYTHIA [15] event generator such that the generator properly\ndescribes previous measurements. In particular figure 1 illustrates the measured and predicted\ncharged particle density for non-single diffractive events as a function of the centre of mass\nenergy. There are clear differences in the predicted multiplicities of PYTHIA(ATLAS and CDF\ntune-A [16]) and PHOJET [17, 18] at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) centre of mass energies\n\u221a\n\u221a\nof s = 10 TeV and s = 14 TeV.\nThe first physics run of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is expected to take place in late\n\u221a\n2009. The LHC is expected to run first at a centre of mass energy s = 10 TeV during 2009\u221a\n2010, and then at s = 14 TeV following a shutdown. Data collected from the first physics\nrun at the LHC will allow models of soft QCD processes to be constrained. These studies are\nvital to understand QCD within the LHC energy regime and to model additional proton-proton\ninteractions, which will be abundant at higher instantaneous luminosities.\n2\n\nPredicted Properties\n\nThe total p-p cross section can be expressed as a sum of the components parts,\n\u03c3tot = \u03c3elas + \u03c3sd + \u03c3dd + \u03c3nd\nwhere these cross-sections are elastic (\u03c3elas ), single diffractive (\u03c3sd ), double diffractive (\u03c3dd )\nand non-diffractive (\u03c3nd ), respectively. In this approximation the small central diffractive component of the cross section is ignored. Predictions for the cross sections at 14 TeV are given\nMPI08\n\n109\n\n\fdNch/d\u03b7 at \u03b7=0\n\n10\nPYTHIA6.214 - ATLAS\nPYTHIA6.214 - CDF tune A\nPHOJET1.12\n\n8\n\n6\n\n-\n\npp interactions\nUA5 and CDF data\n\n4\n\nATLAS\n\n2\n\n0\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\u221as (GeV)\n\n5\n\nFig. 1: Central charged particle density for non-single diffractive inelastic p-p\u0304 collisions.\n\nelsewhere [19]. 10 TeV cross sections are expected to be of the order of 10% lower. Using the\nPYTHIA and PHOJET event generators the predicted properties of the dNCh /d\u03b7 and dNCh /dpT\ndistributions are illustrated in figure 2. This paper focuses on the dNCh /d\u03b7 and dNCh /dpT distributions, and the very first results expected from the ATLAS detector.\n3\n\nEvent Selection\n\nThe LHC is expected to run with a range of different operating parameters, providing different\nmean numbers of interactions per p-p bunch crossing. During initial running it is expected that the\nmean number of inelastic interactions per p-p bunch crossing will be much less than one. Within\nthis operating regime it is necessary to select the rare events containing inelastic interactions over\nthose where the beams do not produce such an interaction and only detector noise is recorded.\nOnce the mean number of interactions approaches, or exceeds unity the majority of inelastic\ninteractions will be selected by simply requiring the presence of two crossing proton bunches.\nThe ATLAS detector [1] is a multi-purpose detector designed to study all areas of physics\nat the LHC. The key components for early Minimum Bias physics measurements are the Inner\nDetector (ID) and sections of the trigger system dedicated to the selection of inelastic interactions\nwith minimal bias. The ID covers radii of 50.5 mm to 1066 mm and is composed of a silicon\npixel system, a silicon micro-strip tracker (SCT), and a gas-based transition radiation detector\n(TRT). The ID is housed inside a solenoid magnet which produces a 2 Tesla axial magnetic field.\nA summary of the active ID acceptance is given in table 1, where the silicon tracking detectors\n110\n\nMPI08\n\n\fT\n\n1/Nevents dN/dp\n\n1/Nevents dN/d\u03b7\n\nnon-diffractive (PYTHIA)\n\n14\n\nnon-diffractive (PHOJET)\nsingle diffractive (PYTHIA)\nsingle diffractive (PHOJET)\n\n12\n\ndouble diffractive (PYTHIA)\n\nATLAS\n\ndouble diffractive (PHOJET)\n\n10\n\nnon-diffractive (PYTHIA)\nnon-diffractive (PHOJET)\n\n104\n\nsingle diffractive (PYTHIA)\nsingle diffractive (PHOJET)\ndouble diffractive (PYTHIA)\ndouble diffractive (PHOJET)\n\n3\n\n10\n\n8\n\n102\n\nATLAS\n\n6\n10\n4\n1\n2\n\n0\n-6\n\n-1\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\nT\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 2: Pseudorapidity (a) and transverse momentum (b) distributions of stable charged particles from simulated\n14 TeV p-p inelastic collisions generated using the PYTHIA and PHOJET event generators\n\nand the TRT cover |\u03b7| < 2.5 and |\u03b7| < 2.0 respectively.\nPixel\nSCT\nTRT\n\nBarrel (3 layers)\nEnd-cap (2x3 disks)\nBarrel (4 layers)\nEnd-cap (2x9 layers)\nBarrel (73 straw planes)\nEnd-cap (160 straw planes)\n\nRadius (mm)\n50.5 < R < 122.5\n88.8 < R < 149.6\n299 < R < 514\n275 < R < 560\n563 < R < 1066\n644 < R < 1004\n\nLength (mm)\n0 < |z| < 400.5\n495 < |z| < 650.0\n0 < |z| < 749\n839 < |z| < 2735\n0 < |z| < 712\n848 < |z| < 2710\n\nTable 1: A summary table of the ATLAS ID acceptance.\n\nDuring initial low luminosity running, events will be selected with the Minimum Bias\ntrigger. For initial measurements based on charged tracks reconstructed in the ID, inelastic collisions will be selected with either the Minimum Bias ID trigger or the Minimum Bias Trigger\nScintillators (MBTS). The primary Minimum Bias ID trigger uses Pixel clusters and SCT space\npoint information and covers |\u03b7| < 2.5. The MBTS are situated at z = \u00b13560 mm and are\nsegmented into eight units in azimuth and two units (2.82 < |\u03b7| < 3.84, 2.09 < |\u03b7| < 2.82) in\npseudo-rapidity.\nMPI08\n\n3\n\np (GeV)\n\n\u03b7\n\n111\n\n\fThe ATLAS detector has a three stage trigger to select events: Level 1, Level 2 and the\nEvent Filter (EF). Inelastic events are selected if they satisfy one of the Minimum Bias Level 1\ntriggers. Most of the events containing tracks within the ID acceptance will be selected by either\nthe level 1 MBTS trigger or the random filled bunch trigger (L1 RDO FILLED). Events passing\nthe random filled bunch trigger will be filtered at Level 2 by using ID information.\nA Level 1 MBTS trigger is formed by requiring a given number of MBTS counters above\nthreshold. For the selection of inelastic interactions with minimal bias it is necessary to require\na minimum number of MBTS counters. A requirement of just one counter is sensitive to the\nelectronic noise level, and therefore two counters are preferred. For minimum trigger selection\nbias the number of MBTS counters above threshold from the two sides are summed. If this sum\nis greater than or equal to 2 the primary physics trigger L1 MBTS 2 fires.\nL1 RDO FILLED simply requires the presence of two proton bunches and a random\nclock cycle. During the initial running period the luminosity is expected to be too low for\nL1 RDO FILLED to be used without filtering at Level 2. At Level 2, events selected with\nL1 RDO FILLED are passed to the Minimum Bias ID trigger, where the total number of Pixel\nclusters and SCT space points are used to select p-p bunch crossings containing an inelastic\ninteraction. The SCT modules are made from pairs of silicon sensors mounted in small angle\nstereo with each other. A space point is formed from a strip hit coincidence of the pair of sensors, reducing the sensitivity to noise. Pixel clusters are formed from a cluster of pixels above a\ntime-over-threshold constraint. While the Pixel clusters only include one sensor plane the noise\noccupancy is expected to be low enough [20, 21] for the total number of pixel clusters to be\nused within the Minimum Bias ID trigger. Thresholds for the multiplicity constraints on Pixel\nand SCT detectors were set by studying the simulated performance of these detectors, where the\nnoise model contained random electronic noise occupancies taken from detector measurements.\nEvents which pass the Pixel cluster and SCT space point requirements are further filtered at the\nEF by requiring a number of reconstructed tracks. For the EF selection of an event two tracks\nwere required to have pT > 200 MeV and a nominal |Z0 | < 200.0 mm, minimally biasing the\nselection, but rejecting some beam background.\nInelastic single diffractive, double diffractive and non-diffractive events were generated\n\u221a\nwith the PYTHIA event generator at s = 14 TeV.

In high multiplicity environments, such\nas expected in high energy hard scatter processes or higher luminosity running at the LHC, it is\nnecessary to normally require a pT cut-off of 500 MeV or higher within the track reconstruction\nsoftware. This cut-off is required to reduce the number of combinations of track candidates and\nimprove the performance of the track reconstruction algorithms. For Minimum Bias events a\nsecond low pT track reconstruction step has been introduced.\nThe ATLAS track reconstruction software [23] is run over the silicon hits twice: finding\ntracks with pT above 500 MeV and then reconstructing the remaining tracks down to a minimum\npT of 100 MeV. Hits that are attached to tracks reconstructed during the first tracking pass are\ntagged such that they are not used during the second pass. Then the second reconstruction pass\nruns with a wider azimuthal road size and looser track reconstruction constraints. During both\nthe first and second pass of the track reconstruction the silicon tracks are projected into the TRT,\nfinding track extensions where present. The combined tracking performance was studied from\n\u221a\ninelastic non-diffractive p-p events generated using PYTHIA at s = 14 TeV which were passed\nthrough the ATLAS GEANT4 detector simulation.\nFollowing previous tracking performance studies [24], the track reconstruction efficiency\nwas defined as the ratio of reconstructed tracks matched to Monte Carlo particles, divided by all\nstable charged primary Monte Carlo particles. The fake rate was defined as the ratio of all primary\nreconstructed tracks not matched to a Monte Carlo particle divided by all primary reconstructed\ntracks. For the measurement of tracking efficiency and fake rate, primary Monte Carlo particles\nand primary reconstructed tracks were selected by requiring:\n\u2022 ID Acceptance (|\u03b7| < 2.5)\n\u2022 Primary Particle\n\n\u2013 Not generated from the GEANT4 simulation.\n\u2013 |d0 | < 2 mm with respect to the generated primary vertex.\n\n\u2022 Stable charged particle PDG id.\n\u2022 pT > 100 MeV\n\nand\n\n\u2022 ID Acceptance (|\u03b7| < 2.5)\n\u2022 No. Silicon Hits \ufffd 5, from 11 planes of silicon.\n\u2022 Primary Track\n\n\u2013 |d0 | < 2 mm with respect to the generated primary vertex.\n\u2013 |Z0 sin(\u03b8)| < 10 mm\n\n\u2022 pT > 100 MeV\n\nrespectively.

Emphasis is given to the methods that are currently under investigation in\nATLAS to constrain the models of UE at the LHC. The recent ATLAS\ntune of the new PYTHIA model (PYTHIA version 6.416) for the UE\nis described and extrapolated to the LHC energies. Studies of UE in\nDrell-Yan and Top events will also be discussed.\n1 Introduction\nAt the LHC essentially all physics will arise from quark and gluon interactions, giving rise to\nboth the small and the large transverse momentum (pT ) regimes. The high pT regimes associated\nwith the hard parton-parton interactions are well described by QCD, whereas the low pT regimes,\ni.e. soft or semi-hard interactions, which are the dominating processes at hadron colliders, are\nonly described by phenomenological models.\nGreat progress has been made at Tevatron in understanding the phenomenological aspects\nof the soft and semi-hard interactions, however several models are available and compatible with\nTevatron data. Since many of these models extrapolated to the LHC energy provide strikingly\ndifferent predictions, we are confident that the LHC data will bring new insight of the soft physics\nand will provide stringent constraints on many aspects of its modelling.\nThe Underlying Event (UE) is an important element of the soft and semi-hard physics in\nthe hadronic environment, which affects all physics, from Higgs searches to physics beyond the\nstandard model. In a hard scattering process it can be defined in many ways, the most general\ndefinition is that the UE is everything accompanying an event but the hard scattering component\nof the hadronic collision.\nThe correct modelling of the UE is a necessary condition for a good understanding of the\nhigh pT physics. For example the UE is important for the understanding of event characteristics\nsuch as the energy flow, the jet and the lepton isolation and the jet flavour tagging.\nThe underlying event has been extensively studied by CDF and compared to predictions\nfrom different models, such as PYTHIA [1], HERWIG [2] and JIMMY [3, 4]. Several tunes of\nthese models to Tevatron and previous experimental data have been investigated so far, however\nall these models give different predictions for the amount of UE activity at the LHC due to\nthe large uncertainties in extrapolating from the lower energy data. The large uncertainties on\nthe UE at the LHC strongly depend on the limited knowledge of the parton density functions\nat the LHC energy regime, the amount of the initial and final state QCD radiation (ISR and\n\u2020\n\nSpeaker\n\nMPI08\n\n117\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 1: (a) Pictorial representation of a double partonic interaction in a proton-proton collision.

From previous\nexperiments, such as CDF and D0, there is strong experimental evidence for the occurrence of\nmore than one hard or semi-hard interaction in one proton-(anti)proton collision (MPI). Since\nmulti partonic interactions will be enhanced at the LHC energies we believe that the LHC and\nthe ATLAS experiment can provide stringent constraints on the current models and shed new\nlight on its underlying mechanism.\n2 The Multi Partonic Interaction at the LHC\nThe multi partonic interaction is critical for describing low-pT effects in the underlying event and\nATLAS plans to measure its contribution at the LHC by studying low-pT Drell-Yan events and\njet-jet + jet-\u03c0(\u03b3) events, as done at Tevatron. The cross section for a double partonic interaction,\n\u03c3D , i.e. the simultaneous occurrence of an hard and a semi-hard interaction, A and B, can be\napproximated as follows\n\u03c3A \u03c3B\n(1)\n\u03c3D (pcut\nT )\u221d\n2\u03c3eff\nwhere \u03c3A and \u03c3B are the cross sections for the single partonic interactions, A and B respectively,\nand \u03c3eff is an effective cross section that contains the information of the parton correlation in the\ntransverse space (see the pictorial representation in Fig. 1(a)). The double partonic interaction\n\u03c3D depends on the minimum transverse momentum cut applied, pcut\nT .\nThe double partonic cross section \u03c3D grows more rapidly than the single partonic cross\n\u221a\nsection as function of s, the collider centre-of-mass energy. For this reason its contribution\nbecomes more important at the LHC energy regime.\n118\n\nMPI08\n\n\fAs Fig. 1(b) [5] shows for the 4-jet production, the double partonic cross section \u03c3D decreases more rapidly than the single partonic cross section for increasing values of the jet pT\nwhile it grows more rapidly as pT \u2192 0. In fact the double partonic cross section becomes\ndominant at the LHC for the jet pT \u2264 20 GeV.\nMulti partonic interactions are expected to have large effects on various processes at the\nLHC, for example HW, W/Z+jets, tt\u0304 and multi jet final state for pmin\nT \u223c 20, 30 GeV.\n\n2.1\n\nThe Underlying Event Models\n\nThere are many models available for the underlying event and the multi partonic interaction\nmechanism. These models can be well tuned at Tevtron energies, but there is no well justified\nway to extrapolate them to the LHC energies due to the lack of a fundamental theory. Here\nfollows a short and non-exhaustive overview of some models, focused on those mentioned in the\nfollowing sections.\nJIMMY [3, 4] implements the eikonal model, which derives from the observation that for\npartonic scatters above some minimum transverse momentum, p\u0302min\n, the values of the hadronic\n\u221aT\nmomentum fraction, x, decrease as the centre-of-mass energy, s, increases. Since the parton\ndensity functions rise rapidly at small x, the perturbatively-calculated cross section grows rapidly\n\u221a\nwith s. At such high densities, the probability of more than one partonic scattering in a single\nhadron-hadron event may become significant. Allowing such multiple scatters reduces the total\ncross section, and increases the activity in the final state of the collisions. The JIMMY model\nassumes some distribution of the matter inside the hadron in impact parameter (b) space, which is\nindependent of the momentum fraction, x. The multi partonic interaction rate is then calculated\nusing the cross section for the hard subprocess, the conventional parton densities, and the area\noverlap function, A(b).\nPYTHIA [1] introduces an effective p\u0302min\nT scale (of the order of 1.5-2.5 GeV), below which\nthe perturbative cross section is strongly damped and allows the possibility to use different models for the MPI. From PYTHIA version 6.3, a more advanced model is available. In this new\nmodel, each multiple interaction is associated with its set of ISR and FSR and the ISR is interleaved with the MPI chain, in one common sequence of decreasing pT values. In other words, a\nsemi-hard second interaction is considered before a soft ISR branching associated with the hardest interaction. This is made possible by the adoption of the pT scale as the common evolution\nvariable.\n3 The ATLAS Tunes\nThe current ATLAS tune for JIMMY version 4.3 has not changed since [6] , whereas the ATLAS tune for PYTHIA has changed considerably since the introduction of the new MPI model\nand parton shower in PYTHIA (MSTP(81)=21). Here the tune of PYTHIA version 6.416 will\nbe briefly discussed, for a more detailed description please refer to the contribution by Arthur\nMoraes [7]. The tunes are done using CTEQ6ll (LO fit with LO \u03b1s ). In PYTHIA version 6.416\nbetter agreement with CDF data is found by minimising the total string length in the colour reconnection between the hard scatter and the soft systems (MSTP(95)=2, PARP(78)=0.3), slightly\nincreasing the pT cut-off (PARP(82)=2.1), increasing the fraction of matter in the hadronic core\nMPI08\n\n119\n\n\f10\nCDF data\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n12\n\n> - transverse region\n\nPYTHIA6.416 - tuned (10 TeV)\n\nJIMMY4.3 - UE (14 TeV)\nJIMMY4.3 - UE (10 TeV)\n\n10\nCDF data\n\n8\n\nsum\n\nPYTHIA6.416 - tuned (14 TeV)\n\n6\n\n< Pt\n\n< Nchg > - transverse region\n\n< Nchg > - transverse region\n\n12\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n10\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nCDF data\n\n8\n\n6\n\n0\n\n10\n\nATLAS\n\nLHC prediction\n\n20\n\nPt leading jet (GeV)\n\n(a)\n\nPYTHIA6.416 - tuned\n\n10\n\n2\nATLAS\n\nLHC prediction\n\n20\n\nJIMMY4.3 - UE\n\n4\n\n2\nATLAS\n\n12\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n0\n\n10\n\nLHC prediction\n\n20\n\nPt leading jet (GeV)\n\n(b)\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nPt leading jet (GeV)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 2: The ATLAS tunes of PYTHIA version 6.416 and JIMMY version 4.3 extrapolated to LHC energies.

Furthermore, both\nPYTHIA and JIMMY extrapolated at low energies provide a good description of the data from\n\u221a\npp\u0304 collisions at s = 630 GeV.\n3.1\n\nPredictions for the LHC\n\n\u221a\nThe current plan to increase the LHC beam energy in discrete steps, s = 10, 14 TeV, offers\nthe opportunity to constrain the energy dependent parameters in UE models in the high energy\nregime. For example, one major issue in extrapolating the UE to LHC energies is the possible\nenergy dependence of the transverse momentum cut-off between hard and soft scatters, p\u0302min\nT in\nthe models.\nIt has been established by the CDF Collaboration that we can define regions in the \u03b7 \u2212 \u03c6\nspace that are sensitive to the UE components of the hadronic interaction. In jet events the\ndirection of the leading jet is used to define regions of \u03b7 \u2212 \u03c6 space that are sensitive to the UE, in\nparticular, the \"Transverse Region\", defined by 60\u25e6 < |\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6 leading jet | < 120\u25e6 , is particularly\nsensitive to the UE.\nFigures 2(a) and 2(b) show different LHC predictions for the average density of charged\nparticles, < Nchg >, in the Transverse Region for tracks with |\u03b7| < 1 and pT > 0.5 GeV\n120\n\nMPI08\n\n\fversus the transverse momentum of the leading jet 1 . The charged particle density is constructed\nby dividing the average number of charged particles per event by the area in \u03b7 \u2212 \u03c6 space. The\nmultiple parton interactions make the predictions rise rapidly and then reach an approximately\nflat plateau region.\nFigures 2(a) and 2(b) show that the particle density in the Transverse Region grows substantially from the Tevatron energy to the LHC energies of 10 TeV and 14 TeV, by the factors\n\u2248 2.5 and \u2248 3.0 respectively. The plots also show that ATLAS tunes for PYTHIA and JIMMY\nare in reasonable agreement at both LHC collision energies. However, figure 2(c) shows that the\nagreement between PYTHIA and JIMMY is not universal, in fact they disagree considerably on\nthe < PTsum > distribution, i.e. the average scalar pT sum of charged particles per event divided\nby the area in \u03b7 \u2212 \u03c6 space. This PYTHIA tune predicts harder particles than the JIMMY tune:\nthe < PTsum > plateau predicted by PYTHIA is about 30% higher than JIMMY. This is a result\nof the tuning of the colour reconnection parameters in PYTHIA version 6.4 model, which has\nbeen specifically adjusted to produce harder particles to fit better the CDF data. This feature is\nnot available in JIMMY version 4.3.\nIt is interesting to notice that, whereas the discrepancy in < PTsum > between the two\nmodels is small at Tevatron, it becomes considerable when the models are extrapolated to the\nLHC energy regime. This gives us an estimate of the large uncertainty on the current UE models\nfor the LHC.\n4 UE studies with Z+jets and top quark events\nBy measuring the UE in various Standard Model production processes like jet, Drell-Yan and top\nquark events one can investigate the possible process dependence of the UE and partially isolate\nthe various components contributing to the UE.\nDrell-Yan lepton pair production provides a very clean environment to study the UE: after\nremoving the lepton-pair from the event everything else is UE. The LHC will copiously produce\nDrell-Yan events with and without associated jets and the large statistics available will allow an\nimportant cross check of the jet results from early LHC running.\nFigure 3 shows the competing effects of the fragmentation and the UE on the pT distribution of the leading jet in Z+jets events. The impact of fragmentation is to reduce the amount of\nenergy in the jet cone. Thus, from fragmentation effects alone, jets at the hadron level tend to\nhave lower pT than jets at the parton level, see Fig. 3(a). The impact of the underlying event is\nto add energy to the hadron level jet. In general, the underlying event tends to add more energy\nto the jet than that lost by fragmentation, see Fig. 3(b), but the exact ratio depends on the radius\nof the jet: the effect of the UE increases for larger radii, whereas the effect of fragmentation\nbecomes smaller for larger radii. The non-perturbative effects become negligible for jets with\npT > 40 GeV in the PYTHIA tune used for this analysis.\nSoft and semi-hard sub-processes in top production events may potentially have a serious\nimpact on top reconstructed parameters, e.g. the top mass, the single top and tt\u0304 production cross\nsections. Variations on the level of UE and ISR/FSR affect observables on which selections cuts\nare applied to identify the top quark, for example: the jet multiplicity and the particle transverse\n1\n\nATLAS Cone jet finders with \u2206R = 0.7\n\nMPI08\n\n121\n\n\fATLAS\n\nPythia Z\u2192\u03bc\u03bc\n\nZ->mumu: UE correction vs ET jets\n\nFragmentation correction vs P jets\nT\n\n1.6\nCone04 jets\n\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n\n0.8\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110\nPT jets (GeV)\n\n# jets(standard)/ # jets (no UE, no frag)\n\n# jets (standard) / # jets (no frag.)\n\n1.8\n\nPythia Z\u2192\u03bc\u03bc\n\n1.8\n\nUE+fragmentation correction vs PT jets\n\n1.6\n\nCone04 jets\nZ->mumu: UE correction vs ET jets\n\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n10\n\nATLAS\n20\n\n(a)\n\n30\n\n40 50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80 90 100 110\nPT jets (GeV)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 3: Ratio of ATLAS Cone \u2206R = 0.4 jet pT distributions (a) between standard PYTHIA version 6.403 and\nPYTHIA version 6.403 without fragmentation and (b) between standard PYTHIA version 6.403 and PYTHIA version\n6.403 without non-perturbative corrections.\n\nmomentum. It is important to estimate the uncertainties on the reconstructed top parameters\nfrom UE and ISR/FSR. These two contributions are strongly coupled together. The ATLAS\ncollaboration has studied the effect of ISR/FSR by varying some of their parameter values in\nPYTHIA to maximise 2 and minimise 3 the reconstructed top mass. These two different settings\ngive a variation on the tt\u0304 event selection efficiency of about 10% and contribute by about 10% to\nthe systematic uncertainty of the tt\u0304 cross section measurement with early LHC data.\n5 Conclusions\nIn this paper we have discussed the importance of underlying event studies for the whole LHC\nphysics program. We have reported on the large uncertainties for the UE predictions at the LHC\nand the opportunity for the LHC and the ATLAS experiment to provide unprecedented constraints\non the current models.\nThe ATLAS tunes of JIMMY version 4.3 and the new PYTHIA model, version 6.416, is\ndiscussed and the extrapolations to the LHC collider energies are presented.

We have estimated an uncertainty of about 10% on the tt\u0304 event selection efficiency and a\ncontribution of about 10% to the systematic uncertainty of the tt\u0304 cross section measurement, due\nto the ISR/FSR uncertainty at the LHC.\nReferences\n[1] T.

The MC generators are tuned to\ndescribe underlying event measurements made by CDF for pp colli\u221a\nsions at s = 1.8 TeV. LHC predictions for the underlying event generated by the tuned models are also compared in this report.\n1 INTRODUCTION\nOver the last few years, the Tevatron experiments CDF and D0 have managed to reduce uncertainties in various measurements to a level in which the corrections due to the underlying event\n(UE) have become yet more relevant than they were in Run I analyses. Studies in preparation\nfor LHC collisions have also shown that an accurate description of the underlying event will be\nof great importance for reducing the uncertainties in virtually all measurements dependent on\nstrong interaction processes. It is therefore very important to produce models for the underlying\nevent in hadron collisions which can accurately describe Tevatron data and are also reliable to\ngenerate predictions for the LHC.\nThe Monte Carlo (MC) event generators PYTHIA [1] and HERWIG [2] are widely used\nfor the simulation of hadron interactions by both Tevatron and LHC experiments. Both generators\nare designed to simulate the event activity produced as part of the underlying event in protonantiproton (pp) and proton-proton (pp) events. In this report we focus on the fortran version of\nHERWIG. This needs to be linked to dedicated package, named \"JIMMY\" [3, 4], to produce the\nunderlying event activity.\nPYTHIA version 6.2 has been shown to describe both minimum bias and underlying event\ndata reasonably well when appropriately tuned [5\u20137]. Major changes related to the description\nof minimum bias interactions and the underlying event have been introduced in PYTHIA version\n6.4 [1]. There is a new, more sophisticated scenario for multiple interactions, new pT -ordered\ninitial- and final-state showers (ISR and FSR) and a new treatment of beam remnants [1].\nJIMMY [4] is a library of routines which should be linked to the HERWIG MC event\ngenerator [2] and is designed to generate multiple parton scattering events in hadron-hadron\nevents. JIMMY implements ideas of the eikonal model which are discussed in more detail in\nRef. [3, 4].\nIn this report we present a tuning for PYTHIA version 6.416 which has been obtained by\ncomparing PYTHIA version 6.416 to the underlying event measurements done by CDF for pp\ncollisions at 1.8 TeV [8, 9]. We also compare the ATLAS tune for HERWIG version 6.510 with\nJIMMY version 4.3 to these data distributions [10].\n\u2020\n\nSpeaker\n\n124\n\nMPI08\n\n\f2 MC predictions vs. UE data\n\n8\n\n< Pt sum > - transverse region\n\n< Nchg > - transverse region\n\nBased on the CDF analysis in Ref.

Two MC generated distributions\nT\nare compared to the data in these plots: one generated with all default settings in PYTHIA version\n6.416 except for the explicit selection of the new multiple parton interaction and new parton\nshower model, which is switched on by setting MSTP(81)=21 [1], and a second distribution\nwith a tuned set of parameters. This particular PYTHIA version 6.416 - tune was prepared for\nuse in the 2008 production of simulated events for the ATLAS Collaboration. The list of tuned\nparameters is shown in Table 1.\nThe guiding principles to obtain the parameters listed in Table 1 were two: firstly the new\nmultiple parton interaction model with interleaved showering and colour reconnection scheme\nwas to be used and, secondly, changes to ISR and FSR parameters should be avoided if at all\npossible.\nIn order to obtain a tuning which could successfully reproduce the underlying event data,\nwe have selected a combination of parameters that induce PYTHIA to preferably choose shorter\nstrings to be drawn between the hard and the soft systems in the hadronic interaction. We have\nalso increased the hadronic core radius compared to the tunings used in previous PYTHIA versions, such as the ones mentioned in Ref. [6, 7].

This corresponds to a rise of a factor of \u223c 2 in the\n128\n\nMPI08\n\n\fplateau of < Nchg > as the colliding energy is increased from\n\n\u221a\n\ns = 1.8 TeV to\n\n\u221a\ns = 14 TeV.\n\nThe < psum\n> distributions in Fig. 5(b) show that PYTHIA version 6.416 - tuned genT\nerates harder particles in the underlying event compared to JIMMY version 4.3-UE. This is in\nagreement with the results shown in Fig. 3, although for the LHC prediction the discrepancy\nbetween the two models is considerably larger than the observed at the Tevatron energy.\nThe difference between the predictions for the charged particle's pT in the underlying event\nis a direct result of the tuning of the colour reconnection parameters in the new PYTHIA version\n6.4 model. This component of the PYTHIA model has been specifically tuned to produce harder\nparticles, whereas in JIMMY version 4.3 - UE this mechanism (or an alternative option) is not\nyet available.\n4 CONCLUSIONS\nIn this report we have compared tunings for PYTHIA version 6.416 (Table 1) and JIMMY version\n4.3 [10] to the underlying event. Both models have shown that, when appropriately tuned, they\ncan describe the data.\nIn order to obtain the parameters for PYTHIA version 6.416 - tuned, we have deliberately\nselected a combination of parameters that generate shorter strings between the hard and the soft\nsystems in the hadronic interaction. We have also increased the hadronic core radius compared\nto the tunings used in previous PYTHIA versions (see Refs. [6, 7] for example).\nWe have noticed that PYTHIA version 6.416 - tuned and JIMMY version 4.3 - UE generate\napproximately the same densities of charged particles in the underlying event. This is observed\nfor the underlying event predictions at the Tevatron and LHC energies alike.\nHowever, there is a considerable disagreement between these tuned models in their predictions for the pT spectrum in the underlying event, as can be seen in Figs. 3 and 5(b). PYTHIA\nversion 6.416 - tuned has been calibrated to describe the ratio < psum\n>/< Nchg >, which has\nT\nbeen possible through the tuning of the colour reconnection parameters in PYTHIA. JIMMY\nversion 4.3 - UE has not been tuned to this ratio.\nAs a final point, we would like to mention that this is an \"ongoing\" study. At the moment\nthese are the best parameters we have found to describe the data, but as the models are better\nunderstood, the tunings could be improved in the near future.\nReferences\n[1] T.

The ALICE detector will measure the frequency of very highmultiplicity events. The performance for measuring the charged-particle\nmultiplicity distribution in ALICE is presented.\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nBeing at LHC the heavy-ion dedicated experiment, ALICE \u2013 A Large Ion Collider Experiment\n[1] \u2013 has some unique capabilities, complementary to those of the dedicated p-p experiments.\nIts 18 detector systems have been designed to provide high-momentum resolution as well as\nexcellent Particle Identification (PID) over a broad momentum range (in particular with very low\npT -cutoff) and up to the highest multiplicities predicted for LHC.\nBesides running with Pb ions, the physics programme includes collisions with lighter ions,\nlower energy running and dedicated proton-nucleus runs. ALICE will also take data with proton\nbeams at varying energies, up to the top LHC energy, to collect reference data for the heavy-ion\nprogramme and to address several QCD topics for which ALICE is complementary to the other\nLHC detectors.\nThe charged-particle multiplicity distribution is among the measurements which are expected to shed light on the dynamics of multiparton interactions. We recall here the results of a\nstudy for evaluating the performances of measuring the charged-particle multiplicity distribution\nwith the ALICE detector.\nThe frequency of non-jet events with very high multiplicity observed by CDF [2] has\nquestioned the models for multiparticle production. Multiparton scattering increases the number\nof soft particles both in minimum-bias events and in the underlying event associated with high-pt\njets. It is expected that multiparton interactions are responsible for the high-multiplicity tails that\nbreak Koba-Nielsen-Olesen (KNO) [3] scaling and become significantly more important at LHC\nenergies. The ALICE detector can make use of its very low-pT cutoff (pT \u2248 100 MeV) and\nof its high-multiplicity trigger to investigate the production of large numbers of soft particles in\nminimum-bias events.\n\u2020\n\nspeaker (present affiliation: Universit\u00e0 di Padova, Italy)\n\nMPI08\n\n131\n\n\fFig. 2: Predictions for the normalized multiplicity distri\u221a\nbution in full phase space for p-p collisions at s = 14\nTeV. The distribution given by the PYTHIA event generFig. 1: Comparison of multiplicity distributions at dif-\n\nator (red and blue for non-single diffractive and inelastic\n\nferent colliding energies normalized at their maximum\n\nevents respectively) is compared to a calculation based on\n\nvalue, taken from [4]. The explanation is in the text.\n\nthe QGSM framework.\n\n2\n\nMultiplicity distribution and multiparton interactions at ALICE\n\nFor p-p and p-p\u0304 collisions at low center-of-mass energies, KNO scaling describes well the multiplicity distribution. As was first observed by UA5 (SPS) and E735 (Tevatron) experiments, thus\n\u221a\nfor energies s > 200 GeV, increasing the energy of the collision system leads to increasingly\nsignificant deviations from KNO scaling. This is shown in Figure 1, where it is assumed that the\npart of the distribution obeying KNO scaling is due to single-parton interactions, while the deviations are due to multiparton contributions. In this plot the number of particles n on the x-axis has\nbeen scaled by the average number of particles \ufffdn1 \ufffd, calculated from the solid curve, obtained\nby fitting the multiplicity at low energy using a polynomial fit in the quantity x = n/\ufffdn1 \ufffd.\nAmong the different explanations of this fact, it has been proposed in the framework of the\nDual Parton Model (DPM) [5] and the Quark Gluon String Model (QGSM) [6] of soft hadronic\ninteractions, that the parts of the distributions that do not scale are due to multiparton interactions\n[7].\n2.1\n\nMultiplicity analysis\n\nThe ALICE detector will perform measurements of the multiplicity distribution in pseudorapidity\nintervals up to |\u03b7| < 1.4. We expect that comparison of model predictions with these measurements will provide valuable information for understanding multiple particle production and for\ntuning the multiparton models included in different event generators. Figure 2 compares the normalized multiplicity distribution for a PYTHIA [8] simulation 1 to a QGSM model prediction\n1\n\nThe version used is 6.2.14 with the so-called \"ATLAS tune\" [9].\n\n132\n\nMPI08\n\n\fshowing the large inconsistency between the two predictions.\nThe initial estimate of the multiplicity distribution at ALICE will be determined by both,\ncounting the SPD tracklets (combination of two clusters in the two innermost pixel layers) in the\nregion |\u03b7| < 1.4, and counting the tracks reconstructed in the ALICE central barrel, in the region\n|\u03b7| < 0.9. In both cases a set of cuts is applied for rejecting secondaries.\n\nFrom full detector simulation one can determine the probability Rmt that a collision with\na true multiplicity t is measured as an event with the multiplicity m and, by varying t, one can\nfill the response matrix R, pictorially shown in Figure 3. In the ideal case of perfect knowledge\nof the response matrix R, and assuming it to be non-singular, the true multiplicity spectrum T\ncan be obtained from the measured spectrum M by:\nT = R\u22121 M.\n\n(1)\n\nIn practice, the assumptions above do not hold and Eq. 1 generates severe artificial oscillations\nin the true spectrum; thus unfolding procedures need to be applied. Two unfolding procedures\nhave been studied and evaluated for measurements of the multiplicity distribution in ALICE [10].\nBayesian unfolding [11] is an iterative procedure based on the following equation:\nRmt Pt\n.\nt\ufffd Rmt\ufffd Pt\ufffd\n\nR\u0303tm = \ufffd\n\n(2)\n\nIt relates the conditional probability R\u0303tm of a true multiplicity t given a measured value m to the\nelements of the response matrix Rmt and to the a priori probability Pt for the true value t; at each\niteration the a priori probability is obtained from the following equation:\nUt =\n\n1 \ufffd\nMm R\u0303tm .\n\ufffd(t) m\n\n(3)\n\nAs initial a priori distribution the measured one can be used.\nThe second method, \u03c72 minimization, e.g. used in [12], consists of finding the unfolded\nspectrum that minimizes a \u03c72 function measuring the distance between measured and guessed\nspectra. It can be expressed by:\n\u03c7 (U ) =\n2\n\n\ufffd \ufffd Mm \u2212\nm\n\n\ufffd\n\nt Rmt Ut\n\nem\n\n\ufffd2\n\n+ \u03b2P (U )\n\n(4)\n\nwhere e is the error on the measured spectrum M and \u03b2P (U ) is a regularization term to prevent\nhigh-frequency fluctuations.\n2.2\n\nPerformance of the unfolding methods\n\nThe performance of the unfolding methods has been evaluated over a rich set of input distributions to check the behavior of unfolding for different shapes of the input spectra.\nThe performance is assessed by calculating the deviation between input and unfolded distributions in different regions of the distribution. The free parameters (e.g. the number of iterations and the weight of the smoothing in the case of the Bayesian method) have been choosen\nMPI08\n\n133\n\n\fsuch that the result is not sensitive to them. Furthermore the residuals are evaluated, i.e. the\ndifference between the measured distribution and the unfolded distribution convoluted with the\nresponse matrix. Calculating the residuals is an important cross-check which can be performed\nalso on real data.\n\nFig. 3: Detector response matrix visualized by the\n\nFig. 4: Summary of the various systematic uncertainties as\n\nnumber of tracklets found in the SPD vs. the number\n\na function of multiplicity.\n\nof generated primary particles in |\u03b7| < 1.\n\nThe comparison of unfolding results obtained with Bayesian unfolding and \u03c72 minimization methods has shown that they agree within statistical errors; a similar comparison should also\nbe performed for real data as a crosscheck that the unfolding works successfully on the measured\ndata.\n2.3\n\nSystematic uncertainties\n\nUnfolding using the response matrix is not sensitive to the shape of the multiplicity distribution,\nwhile it might be sensitive to the internal characteristics of the events and thus to assumptions\nmade in the MC generator. Also effects like misalignment have an impact on the reconstruction and thus on the response matrix. Furthermore, the unfolding method itself causes a nonnegligible systematic uncertainty. An estimate of these uncertainties is summarized in Figure 4,\nwhere they are shown as a function of the multiplicity; the values reported here refer to worst-case\nscenarios and are thus expected to reduce improving the knowledge of the detector (in particular\nthrough alignment and calibration) and of the characteristics of the event (like pt spectrum and\nparticle abundances). These uncertainties refer to a specific MC sample and distribution; they\nwill need to be re-evaluated for the real spectrum.\n3\n\nSummary and conclusions\n\nThe ALICE detector will be able to measure the multiplicity distribution with high sensitivity\nin the central barrel rapidity range. Precise measurements for the different collision systems\nand colliding energies included in the ALICE physics programme are expected to contribute\n134\n\nMPI08\n\n\fclarifying the role of multiparton interactions in shaping the multiplicity distribution. We expect\nalso that the multiplicity distribution provided by ALICE will provide a reference against which\nmodels for multiple particle production and their parameters can be validated. We have presented\na procedure for the measurement of the charged-particle multiplicity distribution with the ALICE\ndetector and the evaluation of its performance.\nReferences\n[1] ALICE Collaboration, K.

Marconi1\u2020, S. Perazzini1 ,V. Vagnoni1\nBologna,\n2 Bologna University and INFN\n1 INFN\n\nAbstract\nThe LHCb detector covers a rapidity region complementary to the ATLAS and CMS central detectors. Through its measurements on Minimum Bias events LHCb can contribute to determine the effects of the\nMulti Partonic Interactions in proton-proton collisions at the LHC centre of mass energy.\n1 The LHCb experiment\nLHCb is a dedicated beauty physics experiment at the LHC accelerator [1]. Advantages of performing a beauty experiment at the LHC proton collider are related to the high value of the quark\nbeauty production cross sections available,which is expected to be of the order of 500\u03bcb at the\n14 TeV energy of the colliding beams. Moreover, running at the LHC accelerator LHCb will\nhave the opportunity to access all the b-hadrons as Bd , Bs and Bc being produced.\nDue to the expected tracks multiplicity the challenge of the LHCb experiment is of performing\nthe exclusive reconstruction of the interesting B signals and the tagging of the B flavour in the\nforward region. In fact, since the differential beauty production cross section peaks at small \u03b8\nangles with respect to the beam line, with small relative opening angles between the b quarks\npairs, the LHCb detector has been instrumented to cover the forward region between 15 mrad\n< \u03b8 < 300 mrad, covering a rapidity region complementary to the ATLAS and CMS central\ndetectors as shown in Figure 1.\nThe LHCb detector has been built as single arm spectrometer, equipped with a vertex detector\n(VELO) [2] and a tracking system [3], [4] for good mass resolution and very precise proper time\nmeasurements of the B secondary vertexes. Excellent particle identification capabilities are provided instead by the two RICH detectors [5], by the calorimeter system [6] and by the muons\ndetector [7].\nDue to the high rate of background events (the inelastic cross section is estimated to be of the\norder of 80 mb), the LHCb detector has been equipped with a selective and efficient trigger system, structured in two levels [8]. The first level, called the Level Zero Trigger (L0), implemented\non custom electronics, aims selecting those events presenting high pT momentum particles in the\nfinal state. The L0 trigger will have to sustain an input rate of 40 MHz to select events at the\nmaximum output rate of about 1 MHz. The High Level Trigger (HLT) is a software trigger, running at the input rate of about 1 MHz, with event size of the order of 50 kB/evt, and a max output\nrate set to about 2 kHz. The HLT is implemented by means of selection algorithms running on\nthe on-line PC cluster [9], [10].\n\u2020\n\n136\n\nspeaker\n\nMPI08\n\n\fLHCb will run at a reduced instantaneous luminosity with respect to the max LHC capabilities,\nin the range 2 \u00f7 5 \u00d7 1032 cm\u22122 s\u22121 , which will allow to maximise the probability of single interaction per bunch crossing, easing the reconstruction of the B secondary vertexes.\n\n1.1 Multi Partonic Interactions tuning in Pythia and minimum bias events\nPythia is the main event generator used by the LHCb collaboration to simulate primary protonproton collisions at the LHC energy. The composite nature of the two colliding protons implies\nthe possibility, modelled in Pythia, that several pairs of partons can enter into separate and simultaneous scatterings, such that Multiple Partonic Interactions (MPI in the following) can take\nplace (in particular at low transverse momentum) contributing to the overall event.\nTuning of the Pythia MPI parameters has been carried out in LHCb since Pythia version 6.1 up\nto version 6.3, although LHCb is currently using for its simulations the new Pythia version 6.4.\nAmongst the MPI models provided by Pythia LHCb selected the so called Pythia \"model 3\",\nwhich simulates the proton-proton collisions by varying the impact parameter, assuming hadron\nmatter overlap consistent with a Gaussian matter distribution and assuming a continuous turn-off\nof the cross-section as a function of the transverse momentum, down to the minimum value of\ntransverse momentum cut-off p\u22a5min .\nThe transverse momentum cut-off plays a very important role in the model since it affects the\naverage number of interactions per collision, according to the relation:\nnmean (s) =\n\n\u03c3hard (p\u22a5min )\n\u03c3nd (s)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c3hard (p\u22a5min ) represents the hard interaction cross-section, while \u03c3nd (s) is the non-diffractive cross-section.\nThe charged multiplicities produced per collision also have a strong dependence on p\u22a5min : lowering the p\u22a5min increases the average number of multiple interactions in an event and therefore\nincreases the average charged multiplicity.\nThe energy dependence of p\u22a5min is assumed to increase, in the same way as the total cross\nsection, to some power low as:\np\u22a5min (s) = P ARP (82)\n\n\ufffd\n\n\u221a\n\ns\nP ARP (89)\n\n\ufffd2P ARP (90)\n\n(2)\n\n\u221a\nwhere the p\u22a5min dependence on s has been expressed in terms of the PARP Pythia parameters.\nOn the other end we also know that the energy dependence of the mean charged multiplicity\nof minimum bias events at hadron collider phenomenologically is well described by a quadratic\nlogarithmic form:\ndNch (s)\n= Aln2 (s) + B ln(s) + C\n(3)\nd\u03b7 |\u03b7|\u22640.25\nIn order to estimate the average multiplicity of minimum bias events at the LHC energy we tune\nthe value of p\u22a5min to reproduce charged multiplicity data from established hadron collider experiments to then extrapolate p\u22a5min to 14 TeV. We can rely on the measured values of the charged\nMPI08\n\n137\n\n\fparticle densities \u03c1exp in the central region of pseudo-rapidity, measured in proton-antiproton\ncollisions performed at energies up to 1.8 TeV, available from the UA5 and CDF experiments:\ndNch (s)\n|\u03b7=0\n(4)\nd\u03b7\nTable 1 shows the values of the charged multiplicities measured in the central pseudo-rapidity\nregion, corresponding to the range of |\u03b7| \u2264 0.25.\nIt is worth to mention that to properly set the value of the relevant Pythia parameters in LHCb we\nalso take into account the need of reproducing the production of B-mesons through orbital exited\nstates. According to the measurements performed at LEP and Tevatron many of the B-mesons\nthat will be produced in primary collisions at LHC are expected to be orbital exited states. Inclusion of the B-meson exited states is important for LHCb in order for studying and optimising the\ntagging algorithms.\nThe parameters affecting the production of B-mesons exited states affect the average multiplicity\nof minimum bias events, since some settings are shared between the heavy and light flavoured\nmesons in the hadronization model. The addition of orbital excited meson states increases the\nmultiplicity produced by Pythia at all the energies at each the primary collisions would take\nplace. The parameters affecting the the production of B-mesons have been set to reproduce the\nmeasured B-meson fraction and LEP B \u2217\u2217 spin counting, measured in the produced B-hadrons.\nPythia is then used to generate non-single-diffractive events at the various centre of mass energies, corresponding to the centre mass energy values of the available measurements of the UA5\nand CDF collaborations listed in Table 1. At a given centre of mass energy the value of p\u22a5min\nparameter is varied over suitable ranges, such that the simulated charged multiplicities spreads\nover two standard deviations around the measured value. The linear fit of the charged multiplicity\nvs the p\u22a5min to determine the best value of p\u22a5min is performed using MINUIT.\nAn example of the best fit of the charged average track multiplicity estimated with Pythia as a\nfunction of p\u22a5min at the centre of mass energies of 546 Gev is shown in Figure 2. The value\nof p\u22a5min is obtained by inverting the fitted line. Sufficient events were generated such that the\nuncertainty on the fitted values is unaffected by the Monte Carlo statistical errors.\nTo extrapolate the value of p\u22a5min to the LHC energy a fit of the p\u22a5min dependence on the centre\nof mass energy is performed using the form suggested by Pythia:\n\ufffd2\ufffd\n\ufffd \u221a\ns\nLHC\n(5)\np\u22a5min (s) = p\u22a5min\n14 T eV\n\u03c1exp (s) =\n\nThe best fit of the p\u22a5min as a function of the centre mass energy is shown in Figure 3. The\n2\nvalue of p\u22a5min we got using Pythia version 6.4 is of pLHC\n\u22a5min = (4.28 \u00b1 0.25) GeV /c , with\nLHC\n\ufffd = (0.119\u00b10.009). By means of the extrapolated value of p\u22a5min it is then possible to use Pythia\nto predict the distribution of the charged multiplicity, the rapidity and momentum distribution of\nthe particles produced in the interactions at the LHC energy.\nThe LHCb collaboration plans to collect large samples of untriggered events, running at the\nmaximum rate of 2 kHz, sustainable by the data acquisition system.\nMinimum Bias data-sets will be used to measure inclusive charged particles distributions, as for\ninstance:\ndN\ndN dN dN\n,\n,\n,\n(6)\nd\u03b7 dp\u22a5 d\u03c6 d\u03b7dp\u22a5\n138\n\nMPI08\n\n\fThe distributions of the charged multiplicity as a function of the pseudo-rapidity, of the transverse\nmomentum and of the azimuthal angle, for both the charge signs, can be achieved in the early\nmeasurements, even with small integrated luminosity samples. As an example the expected\ncharged multiplicity as a function of the pseudo-rapidity is shown in Figure 4. These results are\nvery important by themselves for the understanding of MPI allowing checking the prediction of\nthe Monte Carlo generator used to describe high energy collisions at the LHC collider.\nThe synoptic table of the possible physics reach of LHCb versus the integrated luminosity is\nshown in Figure 5.\n\nFig. 1: Rapidity vs momentum region phase space covered by the LHC detectors.

The primary goal of\nTOTEM is the measurement of the total p-p cross section, using a\nmethod independent of the luminosity. A final accuracy of 1% is expected with dedicated \u03b2 \u2217 = 1540 m runs, while at the beginning a\n5% resolution is achievable with a \u03b2 \u2217 = 90 m optics. Accordingly\nto the running scenarios TOTEM will be able to measure the elastic\nscattering in a wide range of t and to study the cross-sections and the\ntopologies of diffractive events. In a later stage, physics studies will\nbe extended to low-x and forward physics collaborating with CMS as\na whole experimental apparatus.\n\u2020\n\nspeaker\n\nMPI08\n\n143\n\n\f1 Introduction\nThe TOTEM experiment at the LHC will measure [1, 2] the total cross section with \u223c1% uncertainty, by using the luminosity independent method, which requires simultaneous measurements\nof elastic p-p scattering down to the four-momentum transfer squared \u2212t \u223c 10\u22123 GeV 2 and of\nthe inelastic p-p interaction rate with an extended acceptance in the forward region. The extrapolation of the present data to the LHC energy together with the existing cosmic ray data give a\ntypical uncertainty of \u00b115% on the total cross-section. TOTEM will also measure the elastic p-p\nscattering up to \u2212t \u223c 10 GeV 2 and study soft diffraction.\n\nd\u03c3/dt (mb/GeV2)\n\nMoreover, in collaboration with CMS will study jets, W's and heavy flavour production in\nsingle diffractive (SD) and double Pomeron exchange (DPE) events, measure particle and energy\nflow in the forward direction and study central exclusive particle production and low-x physics.\n\nPhoton - Pomeron interference\n\nBSW\nmodel\nPomeron exchange\n\n~ e\u2212 B|t|\n\ndiffractive structure\nCDF\n\nE811\n\npQCD~1/|t|8\n\n-t (GeV2)\n\nFig. 1: Left: COMPETE predictions for total p-p cross section with PS, ISR, SPS, Tevatron and cosmic ray data.\nRight: elastic p-p cross section as predicted by the BSW model; the two columns on the right side show the number\nof events expected after 1 day running at 1028 and 1032 cm\u22122 s\u22121 luminosity.\n\nThe TOTEM experiment is designed to measure \u03c3tot with an accuracy which is sufficient\nto discriminate between the current model predictions for the LHC energy ranging between 90\nand 130 mb (see Fig. 1 for COMPETE [3] fits). Using the optical theorem the total cross section\ncan be written as:\n16\u03c0 (dNel /dt)t=0\n\u03c3tot =\n(1 + \u03c12 ) (Nel + Ninel )\nwhere Nel and Ninel are respectively the elastic and inelastic rate.\n\n144\n\nMPI08\n\n\fFig. 2: The LHC beam line with the Roman Pots at 147 and 220 m.\n\nT1\n\nT2\n\nCMS CASTOR\n\nFig. 3: The TOTEM detectors T1 and T2 installed in the CMS forward region.\n\nThe precise measurement of \u03c3tot provides also an absolute calibration of the machine\nluminosity:\n(Nel + Ninel )2\nL=\n* (1 + \u03c12 )\n16\u03c0(dNel /dt)t=0\nTOTEM needs to run with special running conditions (\u03b2 \u2217 = 1540 m and luminosity L \u2248\n1028 cm\u22122 s\u22121 ). The \u03b2 value at the interaction point requires zero crossing-angle, due to the\nincreased beam size (proportional to \u03b2), and then a reduced number of bunches which is compatible with the LHC injection scheme. Almost half of the total cross\u2013section at the LHC is\npredicted to come from elastic scattering, single, double and central diffractive processes. With\nthe TOTEM acceptance extending up to the pseudorapidities of 6.5, and with the efficient proton\ndetection capabilities close to the LHC beams, the diffractively excited states with masses higher\nthan 10 GeV/c2 are seen by the experiment. The precise luminosity independent measurement\nof the total cross section requires the measurement of d\u03c3el /dt down to \u2212t \u223c 10\u22123 GeV2 , which\ncorresponds to a proton scattering angle of 5 \u03bcrad, and the extrapolation of d\u03c3el /dt to the optical\npoint (t = 0). The leading proton will be detected by silicon detectors placed inside movable\nsections of the vacuum pipe (Roman Pots), located symmetrically with respect to the interaction\npoint (IP) (Fig. 2). In order to measure the inelastic rate, two separate forward telescopes will\nbe installed on both sides, with a rapidity coverage of 3.1 < |\u03b7| < 6.5 (Fig. 3). With these\nadditional detectors, a fully inclusive trigger, also for single diffraction, can be provided with an\nexpected uncertainty on the inelastic rate of the order of 1%, after corrections.\nMPI08\n\n145\n\n\f2 LHC optics\nThe detection of forward protons from elastic or diffractive scattering at LHC energies requires\nthe measurement of very small scattering angles (5\u201310 \u03bcrad). These particles remain close to\nthe beam and can be detected on either side of the IP if the displacement at the detector location\nis large enough. The beam divergence at the IP must be small compared to the scattering angle.\nTo obtain these conditions, a special high-\u03b2 \u2217 insertion optics is required. A large value (O(km))\nof the \u03b2-function at the IP (\u03b2 \u2217 ) and a smaller beam emittance reduce the beam divergence. A\nlarge effective length Lef f at the detector location ensures a sizeable displacement. In fact the\ndisplacement (x(s), y(s)) of a scattered proton at distance s from the IP can be described by the\n\u2217 is the scattering angle at the interaction point, Lef f the effective\nfollowing formula, where \u03b8x,y\nlength, v the magnification and D the dispertion of the machine:\nf\n\u2217\nx(s) = vx (s) * x\u2217 + Lef\nx * \u03b8x +\n\n\u2206p\n* D(s)\np\n\nand\n\nf\ny(s) = vy (s) * y \u2217 + Lef\n* \u03b8y\u2217\ny\n\nThe LHC optics with \u03b2 \u2217 = 1540 m, limited by the strength of the insertion quadrupoles, provides\nlarge Lef f values and parallel-to-point focusing conditions in both projections at 220 m from the\nIP. This is the ideal scenario for TOTEM to measure the total cross section and to study minimum\nbias events and soft diffraction.\nThis large-\u03b2 \u2217 optics requires an injection optics different from the one which will be used at the\nstarting runs of LHC. For this reason, an intermediate-\u03b2 \u2217 optics (\u03b2 \u2217 =90 m), which can use the\nstandard LHC injection optics and can thus be operated in the first period of physics runs, has\nbeen proposed [4]. This optics provides parallel-to-point focusing only in the vertical plane and\na measurement of t down to \u2212t \u223c 3 * 10\u22122 GeV2 , about one order of magnitude higher than with\nthe nominal TOTEM optics, but nevertheless very useful.\n3 The experimental apparatus\nThe TOTEM experiment uses precision silicon microstrip detectors inserted in Roman Pots, movable sections of vacuum chamber (Fig. 4), installed in the machine tunnel, at 147 and 220 m from\nthe IP, to measure the elastically and diffractively scattered protons close to the beam direction.\nEach Roman Pot station consists of 2 units with a distance of 4 (for 220 m station) and 1.5 m (for\n147 m station). Each unit consists of 3 roman pots, 1 horizontal and 2 vertical (top and bottom).\nThe lever arm among different units allows local track reconstruction and a fast trigger selection\nbased on track angle. In order to measure the elastic scattering to the smallest |t| values, the\ndetectors should be active as close to their physical edge as possible. In particular the detectors will have to be efficient up to a few tens of microns to their edge. These are planar silicon\ndetectors with a current terminating structure, which consists in replacing the commonly used\nvoltage terminating guard rings (usually 0.5-1 mm wide) with a 50\u03bcm wide structure of rings\nwhich strongly reduces the influence of the current generated at the detector edge on the active\ndetector volume [5]. The detectors inside the 220 m stations will be installed during year 2009.\n\nThe telescopes for the detection of the inelastic events have a good trigger capability, provide tracking with a good angular resolution and allow the measurement of the trigger efficiency.\n146\n\nMPI08\n\n\fFig. 4: Left: horizontal and vertical roman pots. Right: mounted silicon detectors.\n\nTo discriminate beam-beam from beam-gas events, the telescopes will identify the primary interaction vertex with an accuracy at the level of a cm in the transverse plane by reconstructing a few\ntracks from each side of the interaction point; the knowledge of the full event is not needed.\nThe T1 telescope (Fig. 5) is made of 5 planes of 6 trapezoidal Cathode Strip Chambers (CSC) [6]\nand will be placed in the CMS end-caps in the rapidity range 3.1 < |\u03b7| < 4.7 with a 2\u03c0 azimuthal coverage. It will provide a spatial resolution of \u223c1 mm. T2 (Fig. 5) is made of 20 half\ncircular sectors of triple-GEM [7] (Gas Electron Multiplier) detectors mounted back-to-back and\nwhich will provide a spatial resolution of \u223c 100 \u03bcm in the radial direction; it will be placed in the\nshielding behind the CMS Hadronic Forward (HF) calorimeter to extend the coverage at larger \u03b7.\nWith the present dimension of the vacuum pipe, the T2 telescope will cover with good efficiency\nthe range 5.3 < |\u03b7| < 6.5.\nBoth telescopes will be ready for the installation during year 2009.\n\nFig. 5: Left: T1 quarter ready for the installation.

Right:\nelastic cross section zoomed in the exponential region (the pure exponential behavior is plotted as reference) and t\nacceptance for \u03b2 \u2217 = 1540 m and 90 m optics.\n\nThe measurement of the elastic cross-section is one of the main goals of TOTEM. Different\ntheoretical models [8\u201311] predict different behaviors of the differential cross-section d\u03c3/dt, as\nshown in Fig. 6. All these t ranges can be accessed by TOTEM using different running scenarios.\nIn particular, for what concerns the nuclear region (10\u22123 < t < 0.5 GeV2 ), it can be accessed\nwith high and intermediate \u03b2 \u2217 optics (Fig. 6). Due to the high cross-sections involved even at\nvery low luminosities (1028 < L < 1031 cm\u22122 s\u22121 ) enough statistics can be accumulated in a few\nruns (at least for low-t values). The measurement in the nuclear region, which is theoretically\ndescribed by the exchange of a single Pomeron, is crucial for the extrapolation of d\u03c3el /dt to the\noptical point (t = 0), needed for the measurement of the total p-p cross-section. This can be\ndone fitting and extrapolating the measured rate with a generalized exponential function eB(t) .\nThe early LHC runs will be characterized by low \u03b2 \u2217 optics with a reduced number of bunches and\na lower number of protons per bunch, with respect to the nominal ones. Under these conditions\nonly elastic events with |t| values between 2 GeV2 and 10 GeV2 will be at reach, allowing\nTOTEM to study high-t elastic scattering. The exponential region will be accessible only if a\nhigh/intermediate \u03b2 \u2217 optics will be included in the early physics LHC programme.\n4.2\n\nInelastic rate and total cross-section\n\nThe measurement of the inelastic rate will be done using all TOTEM detectors and using various\ntrigger and offline analysis strategies, depending on the actual running scenario. At low luminosities a single arm trigger which requires activity in one side of T1 or T2 can be utilized to\nhave very high efficiency; it misses only low mass single diffractive events but it would suffer\nfrom beam-gas interactions, which strongly depend on the beam current. With a double arm\n148\n\nMPI08\n\n\fT1/T2 trigger the beam-gas background can be suppressed but, on the other hand, the efficiency\nin detecting single diffractive events is quite reduced. Offline, the sample purity can be enhanced\nreconstructing the primary interaction vertex. Moreover, the rate of low mass diffractive events\nwhich escape detection can be partly recovered extrapolating the measured cross-section with\ntheoretical assumptions on d\u03c3/dM 2 .\nCombining the uncertainties that come from the measurement of the inelastic and elastic\nrate and from the extrapolation of the diffractive cross-section to the optical point, it results that\na 1% error on the total cross-section is achievable with the dedicated \u03b2 \u2217 = 1540 m optics and a\n5% can be reachable in an earlier stage with the intermediate 90 m optics (see Table 1).\nWith T1 and T2 detectors minimum bias events can be studied, mainly focusing on the\ncharged multiplicity in the covered \u03b7 range.\nUncertainty\ndNel /dt \u2192 0\nNel\nNinel\n\u03c1\n\u03c3tot\n\n\u03b2 \u2217 = 90 m\n4%\n2%\n1%\n1.2%\n5%\n\n\u03b2 \u2217 = 1540 m\n0.2%\n0.1%\n0.8%\n1.2%\n1-2%\n\nTable 1: Contributions to the total cross-section for two different LHC optics.\n\n4.3\n\nDiffraction\n\nDuring the early runs with low \u03b2 \u2217 beams, diffractive protons with \u03be = \u2206p\np in the range 0.02-0.2\nwill be detectable by the Roman Pots at 220 m (Fig. 7). This will allow TOTEM to measure the\nSD\n2\ndifferential\n\u221a cross-section for single diffractive events (d\u03c3 /dM ) for masses from 2 to 6 TeV/c\n(M = \u03bes) with a mass resolution of 10% or better. Also double Pomeron exchange events\n(DPE) can be detected with sufficient statistics and the differential cross section can be measured\nin the range 0.25 < M < 2.8 TeV/c2 with a mass resolution of 10% or better. Using a higher \u03b2 \u2217\noptics a much larger fraction of diffractive protons can be observed (\u223c 65% for \u03b2 \u2217 = 90 m and\n\u223c 95% for \u03b2 \u2217 = 1540 m). Since with these optics protons with \u03be values down to 10\u22128 can be\ndetected, all the mass spectrum for SD and DPE events can be investigated.\n5 Conclusion\nThe TOTEM detectors will be operational for the first physics runs of the LHC. The accessible\nphysics is strongly dependent on the running condition of the accelerator. At the beginning, with\na low-\u03b2 \u2217 optics, diffraction at large masses and elastic scattering at large t can be studied. The\nuse of an intermediate \u03b2 \u2217 = 90 m optics will allow even at an early stage to measure, even if with\na \u223c5% precision the total p \u2212 p cross-section, which the main goal of the experiment. A better\nprecision will be achieved only when the TOTEM nominal optics (\u03b2 \u2217 = 1540 m) is available.\nMoreover, at a later stage, a common physics progamme about low-x and forward physics will\nbe brought on with CMS [12].\nMPI08\n\n149\n\n\fFig. 7: Left: acceptance in log10 t and log10 \u03be for diffractive protons at RP220 for different optics.

Jung2\n1 Tel Aviv University,\n2 Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron, Hamburg and Physics Department, University Antwerp\nMeasurements of structure functions and parton densities at HERA and the Tevatron have\nprovided much insights into the high energy behavior of cross sections. The structure functions\nand parton densities increase rapidly with increasing energies, consistent with pQCD calculations. However, this increase with energy is much more rapid than for the total cross sections\nof \u03b3p and pp collisions. Vector meson and diffractive dijet production in ep provide an effective\nmethod to measure the energy dependence of the generalized gluon distribution of the proton as\nwell as the impact parameter dependence of the gluon distribution.\nAt sufficiently small x achievable at LHC new QCD regimes are expected. In particular\nwithin the double logarithmic approximation the transverse momenta of radiated partons in the\ncurrent fragmentation region begin to increase with increasing energy. Besides this, the interpretation of parton distributions as probability distribution becomes in conflict with the probability\nconservation at the kinematics to be achieved at LHC. Therefore, the challenging question is\nto quantify the boundaries of this kinematical regime and elucidate properties of the new QCD\nregime of strong interaction with small coupling constant.\nAt the high energies of the LHC multjet cross sections will become more and more important. For the detailed calculation of multi-jet cross sections of moderate transverse momentum,\nintegrated single parton density functions are no longer sufficient. Multi-parton densities in impact parameter space are needed.\nWhereas in principle the relation between diffraction and multi-parton interaction is given\nby the AGK rules, the details in terms of QCD are not yet fully understood. The topic of creation\nof rapidity gaps (diffractive processes) and the influence of absorptive effects, which can destroy\nthe rapidity gap, is currently under detailed investigations, both theoretically and experimentally.\nThese effects are directly related to multi-parton interaction in non-diffractive processes.\nThe separation of soft and hard processes in impact parameter space will tell whether\nmulti-parton interactions are dominated by the soft - strong coupling regime, or whether significant contributions come also from the weak coupling - perturbative region. Indications, that\nhard perturbative processes are in the regime of strong interaction with weak running coupling\nconstant come from the diffractive jet (vector meson) production but also from investigations of\nmultiparton interactions with Monte Carlo event generators. To avoid too large particles multiplicities in pp collisions at LHC energies the standard approaches are applicable to the regions\n>\nof p2t \u223c 6GeV 2 . Below this value multi-parton interactions probably cannot be considered as\nindependent. The issue of separating soft from hard processes can be also investigated by the\ntransverse momentum distribution of jets close to the rapidity gap and by the standard forward\nand Mueller-Navelet jets. At LHC energies it becomes practical to separate experimentally peripheral and central collisions. Small x physics of hard processes, new heavy particle production\nare concentrated at central pp collisions, soft QCD is mostly peripheral. Hard (soft) diffraction\nare dominated by central(peripheral) collisions\nMPI08\n\n153\n\n\fThe topics of the session small x and diffraction were grouped around these major areas.\nMuch progress has been achieved in the last years, both experimentally and theoretically, which\nis reflected in the presentations in this session. However, a full understanding of small x and\ndiffractive processes is still far ahead. We mention a few of the major open issues:\n\u2022 how well do we understand PDFs at small x ?\n\u2022 how well do we understand the properties of new regime of high density QCD in the weak\ncoupling constant limit ?\n\u2022 what is the relation between diffraction and multiparton interaction in the region of high\ngluon density in small x QCD where coupling constant is small but the interaction is strong\n?\n\u2022 what is the interplay between soft and hard processes ?\n\u2022 how can diffraction and saturation be consistently implemented in Monte Carlo event generators ?\n\u2022 what are the impact parameter distributions of partons and the correlations between partons\nwithin the wave functions of the colliding hadron in case of multiparton interactions ?\n\n154\n\nMPI08\n\n\fLow-x physics at LHC\nRonan McNulty\u2020\nSchool of Physics, University College Dublin, Dublin 4, Ireland.\nAbstract\nCollisions at the LHC sample a broad range of values in the x \u2212 Q2\nplane. Each of the LHC experiments have different acceptances and instrumentation that give them sensitivity to low-x physics through various experimental measurements: the cross-section for W and Z boson\nproduction; low mass Drell-Yan production; exclusive particle production in the forward region; and forward jet production. Measurements\nof these quantities will test the Standard Model, and constrain the parton distribution functions. Measurements of x as low as 10\u22126 appear\npossible that would allow tests of QCD in which saturation effects may\nbe observed.\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nProton proton collisions at the LHC are fundamentally collisions between the constituent partons\nwhose distribution, f , can be described as functions of x, the fractional momentum carried by\nthe parton, and Q2 , the energy scale of the partonic collision. The cross-section, \u03c3, for a process\npp \u2192 X is a summation over all kinematically possible partonic processes ab \u2192 X:\n\u03c3X (Q2 ) =\n\n\ufffd\ufffd 1\na,b\n\n0\n\ndx1 dx2 fa (x1 , Q2 )fb (x2 , Q2 )\u03c3\u0302ab\u2192X (x1 , x2 , Q2 )\n\n(1)\n\nThe kinematic region accessible by the LHC operating at an energy of 14 TeV is shown\nby the largest shaded region in Figure 1. Experimentally, it is often easier to deal with rapidity,\np+pz\n1\nz\ny = 12 ln( E+p\nE\u2212pz ) of a particle with energy E or pseudo-rapidity, \u03b7 = 2 ln( p\u2212pz ) = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2)\nwhere the z axis is coincident with the beam and pz = p cos \u03b8. The coverage of the four LHC\nexperiments is compared in section 2: ATLAS and CMS are fully instrumented in the central\nrapidity region, |\u03b7| < 2.5 with some detectors in the forward region; LHCb is fully instrumented\nin the forward region, 1.9 < \u03b7 < 4.9; while ALICE has forward muon coverage and full tracking\nand calorimetry in the most central region |\u03b7| < 0.9.\n\nIn order to produce an object of mass Q at a rapidity of y, one requires partons with\n\u221a\n\u221a\nx1 = Qey / s and x2 = Qe\u2212y / s. A rapidity axis is superimposed on the x \u2212 Q2 axes in Figure 1 which, at least for light particles where y \u2248 \u03b7, allows the sensitivity of the LHC detectors\nto low-x physics to be judged. The central detectors can only access the low-x region by observing the production of low-Q2 objects, while LHCb can access equivalent x-regions at higher Q2 .\nThe dark shading in Figure 1 shows the regions where previous experiments have made measurements. The central LHC detectors, for the most part, overlap with previous experiments and in\n\u2020\n\nThe author wishes to acknowledge the support of Science Foundation Ireland through grant 07-RFP-PHYF393\n\nMPI08\n\n155\n\n\fFig. 1: Main figure: The region in x \u2212 Q2 that is kinematically accessible to the LHC. Regions surveyed by previous\nexperiments are indicated by darker shading. The insert shows the region that the LHCb experiment samples.\n\nparticular HERA, while LHCb samples one parton at high-x where many previous measurements\nexist, and one at very low-x where either no current data exists or DGLAP evolution [1] from\nlower Q2 measurements at HERA is required.\nConsequently the low-x region can be probed by the central detectors through low mass\nDrell-Yan production and the production of low mass resonances while LHCb and the forward\ncomponents of ATLAS, CMS and ALICE can also look at forward resonances, forward jets, and\nhigher mass Drell-Yan processes including W and Z production. These physics channels are\nexamined below after making a brief survey of the different LHC detectors.\n2\n\nThe LHC detectors\n\nFigure 2 attempts to summarise, schematically, the coverage of the sub-detectors classified by\nfunction, of each of the LHC experiments. A brief description follows which includes an overview\nof the relevant triggers required to access the physics channels above.\nThe ATLAS [2] detector has tracking chambers inside |\u03b7| < 2.5, electromagnetic and\nhadronic calorimeters in |\u03b7| < 4.9, and muon chambers in |\u03b7| < 2.7. In addition they have\ncounters (LUCID), primarily for luminosity measurements, in 5.6 < |\u03b7| < 6.0, and counters and\nhadronic calorimeters (ZDC) in the far forward regions |\u03b7| > 8.3. They can trigger on muons\nand electrons with transverse momenta down to 4 GeV/c.\nThe CMS [3] detector's primary tracking also covers |\u03b7| < 2.5, however TOTEM [4]\n156\n\nMPI08\n\n\fFig. 2: A schematic representation of each of the LHC detectors where the horizontal axis is pseudorapidity. The\nfunctionality of the subdetectors is indicated by the shading as labelled.\n\nextends the coverage into the forward region with tracking stations at 3.1 < |\u03b7| < 4.7 and\n5.2 < |\u03b7| < 6.5. Electromagnetic and hadronic calorimetry are present in |\u03b7| < 6.5. Muon\nchambers are present in the central region: |\u03b7| < 2.5. They can trigger on muons and electrons\ndown to transverse momenta of 3.5 GeV/c.\nALICE [5] has tracking, electromagnetic and handronic calorimeters inside |\u03b7| < 0.9.\nHowever, muon chambers occupy the region \u22124 < \u03b7 < \u22122.5 and counters exist in the extended\nregion \u22123.4 < \u03b7 < 5. They can trigger on muons down to transverse momenta of 1 GeV/c.\n\nLHCb [6] is fully instrumented with tracking, calorimetry, muon chambers and particle\nidentification through RICH detectors, between 1.8 < \u03b7 < 4.9. They can trigger on muons down\nto transverse momenta of 1 GeV/c and hadrons of 2.5 GeV/c.\n3\n\nForward W and Z production\n\nThe production of vector bosons is not what one would first consider to be low-x physics, and\nindeed in the central region the x of both partons are roughly similar, x1 \u2248 x2 \u2248 0.005 and the\nscattering occurs between sea quarks. However, in the forward region in which LHCb is sensitive,\nx1 lies between 0.04 and 0.8 while x2 is between 4 \u00d7 10\u22125 and 8 \u00d7 10\u22124 and the scattering is\nmore likely to occur between valence and sea quarks. The partonic cross-section for W and Z\nproduction is known to about 1%, so most of the uncertainty in the cross-section calculation\nresides in the knowledge of the PDFs at low x values. PDFs in the region Q2 \u2248 104 GeV2 ,\n4 \u00d7 10\u22125 < x < 8 \u00d7 10\u22124 have never been directly measured before so a measurement of W and\nZ production is also a test of the DGLAP evolution from experiments at lower Q2 .\nMPI08\n\n157\n\n\fThe effect of current knowledge of\nthe parton distribution functions (PDFs)\non the vector boson cross-section predictions is shown in Fig 3 which was produced using the MCFM generator [7] with\nthe NNPDF [8] parton distribution functions and shows the percentage uncertainties on the vector boson distributions as a\nfunction of Z boson rapidity, and the pseudorapidity of the lepton coming from the\nW.\nLHCb have studied the sensitivity\nof their detector to this physics [9]. Z\nbosons can be reconstructed in the channel Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc. The efficiency for triggering and reconstructing two high transverse\nmomentum muons is high: > 90%. The\nZ can easily be isolated from competing\nbackgrounds, predominantly semileptonic\nB decays, by requiring high muon transverse momentum, isolation of each muon,\nand compatibility with the primary vertex. Less than 0.5% background remains\nin a window of 20 GeV/c2 around the Z\nFig. 3: The 90% confidence level band on the Z cross-section\nmass. The high efficiency and large crossas a function of rapidity and W+,W- cross-sections as a function\nsection mean that a statistical precision of\nof the daughter lepton pseudorapidity. The cross-sections were\n2.5% will be obtained with just 10 pb\u22121 of\ncalculated using the MCFM generator with the NNPDF parton\ndata, falling to below 1% after 100 pb\u22121 .\ndistribution set.\nThus the measurement quickly becomes\ndominated by systematic uncertainties. It\nseems likely that detector effects influencing the efficiency estimate can be controlled to better than 0.5% leaving the dominant uncertainty to be the estimation of the machine luminosity\nwhich may reach a precision of 1 to 2% using channels such as the elastic production of exclusive\ndimuon events. [10, 11]\nW bosons can be identified by LHCb in the channel W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd and can be triggered with\nhigh efficiency, (> 90%), by the requirement of a single high transverse momentum muon. Background processes are reduced by requiring that apart from the muon, there is little other activity\nin the event. The largest backgrounds come from Z events where only one muon enters the LHCb\nacceptance, and from high momentum pions or kaons which are misidentified as muons either\nbecause they decay in flight or they punch-through to the muon chambers. With suitable cuts on\nthe muon momentum and the rest of the activity in the event, a signal efficiency of about 35% can\nbe obtained with a purity of 85%. A statistical uncertainty better than 1% can thus be obtained\nafter 10 pb\u22121 of data. Apart from the luminosity determination, the largest systematic is likely to\n158\n\nMPI08\n\n\fFig. 4: The percentage uncertainty at the 90% confidence limit on RW Z , R+\u2212 and A+\u2212 calculated using the\nMSTW2007NLO PDF set.\n\nbe due to the estimation of the background; however one is not overly reliant on the simulation\nin calculating this since background test samples can be produced from the data itself. It is expected that a systematic uncertainty below 1% can be attributed leaving the dominant systematic\nuncertainty, as for the Z analysis, coming from the luminosity determination.\nOne way to remove the luminosity uncertainty is to look at ratios of cross-sections. Rather\nthan comparing \u03c3Z , \u03c3W + , \u03c3W \u2212 to theory, one can consider the combinations [12, 13]:\nRW Z =\n\n(\u03c3W + + \u03c3W \u2212 )\n\u03c3W +\n(\u03c3W + \u2212 \u03c3W \u2212 )\n, R+\u2212 =\n, A+\u2212 =\n.\n\u03c3Z\n\u03c3W \u2212\n(\u03c3W + + \u03c3W \u2212 )\n\n(2)\n\nThe experimental uncertainty on these quantities will be less than 1% while Figure 4\n(from [13]) shows the theoretical uncertainty coming from knowledge of the PDFs, as a function\nof rapidity. RW Z is insensitive to the PDFs and the most sensitive test of the Standard Model\noccurs between 2 < y < 3. However R+\u2212 in the LHCb range, is dominated by the uncertainty\non the d-valence quark distribution, and A+\u2212 is dominated by the uncertainty on the difference\nin the u-valence and d-valence distributions. An experimental measurement at the 1% level will\nthus signficantly improve our knowledge of the PDFs.\n\nMPI08\n\n159\n\n\f4\n\nCentral and Forward Drell-Yan production\n\nThe production of muon or electron pairs through the\nDrell-Yan production of a virtual photon allows one to\naccess a lower range in x: Figure 1 shows that moving\nto lower Q2 for a given rapidity, moves one to smaller\nx. Thus the x range accessible to LHCb at a Q corresponding to the Z mass is accessible to ATLAS and\nCMS when looking at a photon of about 5 GeV/c2 . The\ncross-section for such processes is very much larger\nthan for the Z; however the backgrounds are even bigger meaning that the overall experimental uncertainties\nin this channel will be greater.\nATLAS have examined the production of electron pairs [14] and have sensitivity down to photon\nmasses of 8 GeV/c2 , this limit being determined by the\nthreshold on the transverse momentum of their electron\ntrigger. They require two oppositely charged electrons\nin events where the missing transverse energy is less\nthan 30 GeV. Figure 5 shows the signal well separated\nfrom the background coming from tau pairs, top events,\nW pairs, and dijets. This last background has the largest\nuncertainty due to finite Monte Carlo statistics. A statistical precision of 7% is expected in the mass range\ndata.\n\nFig. 5: Signal and estimated background for\nelectron pairs produced by Drell-Yan interactions as a function of the invariant mass of the\nelectrons, for the ATLAS experiment.\n\nfrom 8 to 60 GeV/c2 with 50 pb\u22121 of\n\nCMS have examined the same channel [15] but\nin the very forward region using the TOTEM detector. They trigger on events that deposit more than 300\nGeV in the electromagnetic calorimeters and less than\n5 GeV in the hadronic calorimters with one or more\ncharged particles between 5.2 < |\u03b7| < 6.5. Events\nwith a di-electron invariant mass above 4 GeV/c2 are\nselected. This signal probes values of x down to 10\u22126\nand is potentially sensitive to saturation effects as can\nbe seen in Figure 6 (from [15]) where the cross-section\nhas been computed with one of the standard CTEQ [16]\nPDF sets, and with a particular saturation scheme as\ndescribed by EHKQS [17]. The effect of background\nevents is being evaluated.\nLHCb [9] have performed a study in the channel with two muons in the final state. Very low trigpairs selected by CMS and TOTEM using two\nger thresholds can be placed on muons in LHCb; the\nPDF sets, with and without saturation effects.\nsummed transverse momenta of both muons must only\nexceed 1.6 GeV/c and thus very low Q2 are accessible.\nFig. 6: Differential cross-section for electron\n\n160\n\nMPI08\n\n\fThe problem however lies in extracting a clean signal at such low invariant masses due to the\noverwhelming background coming from semi-leptonic b and c quark decays, as well as detector\neffects in mis-identifying pions and kaons as muons. A multi-variate selection has been employed in order to select events which have little missing energy and little other activity apart\nfrom the two muons.\nReasonably pure samples appear\npossible; > 70% for photon masses above\n5 GeV/c2 which would access x values of\n2 \u00d7 10\u22126 . A full systematic study is ongoing and is likely to be limited by the precision with which the efficiency and purity\nof the selection can be determined, since\nthe multi-variate selection is quite sensitive to the details of the simulation, and in\nparticular, the underlying event.\nHowever, a very precise experimental value is not required in order to\nimprove the current theory, particularly in\nthe forward region. Figure 7 (from [13])\nshows the theoretical uncertainty on the\nDrell-Yan cross-section due to the PDFs\nas a function of rapidity, for two different masses. Even a total experimental uncertainty of 10% in measuring the crosssection for masses of 8 GeV/c2 will improve the current theory. At lower masses\nand high rapidities, there is essentially no\ntheoretical prediction because there is no\nHERA data at such low x values to evolve\nfrom.\n\nMPI08\n\nFig. 7: The percentage uncertainty at the 90% confidence\nlevel on the cross-section as a function of rapidity for the\nDrell-Yan process at two mass scales, calculated using the\nMSTW2007NLO parton distribution set.\n\n161\n\n\f5\n\nExclusive Particle Production\n\nThe exclusive production of dimuons at the LHC is interesting both in terms of the physics that it\naccesses and the uses to which these channels can be put. CDF recently published results for this\nfinal state [18]. Two distinct processes are seen: firstly a continuum where the muons are produced through \u03b3\u03b3 interactions. and secondly the presence of resonances indicating charmonium\nproduction through photon-pomeron interactions.\nThe former process is of particular interest in measuring the LHC luminosity since it is theoretically known to\nbetter than 1% and several studies have\nbeen performed by CMS, ATLAS and\nLHCb [10, 11]. The latter process is important in describing the pomeron and in\nsearches for odderons. The low thresholds on the muon trigger at LHCb mean\nthey will quickly be able to see the J/\u03a8\nand \u03a8\ufffd resonances that CDF have already\nobserved, and in addition make observaFig. 8: Preliminary CMS result showing the expected resolutions of exclusive bottomonium production with which exclusive bottomonium production could be\ntion. ALICE, making use of their forobserved with 100pb\u22121 of data.\nward muon detectors, should be able to\nobserve J/\u03a8 [19] which will probe x re\u22126\ngions down to 10 . CMS have made a preliminary study of bottomonium production [11], and\nsome results are shown in Figure 8 which indicates that clear \u03a5, \u03a5\ufffd , \u03a5\ufffd\ufffd signals will be visible\nwith 100pb\u22121 of data.\n6\n\nForward jet production\n\nAccessing the low-x region through jet production requires excellent calorimetry in the forward\nregion. CMS have investigated the number of\nevents they would be able to see with a transverse\nenergy threshold of 10 GeV using their calorimeters in the range 3 < |\u03b7| < 5. Figure 9 from [11]\nshows the largest number of events occurs at the\nenergy threshold and for x1 \u2248 10\u22121 , x2 \u2248 10\u22124 .\nSuch events have the potential to probe x down\nto 10\u22125 . A full systematic study is underway as\nconfronting data with theory will require a good\nunderstanding of the effects of hadronisation and\nthe underlying event on the definition of the jet Fig. 9: The relationship between the ET of a forward\nenergy.\njet produced in CMS and the x values that are probed.\n\n162\n\nMPI08\n\n\f7\n\nConclusions\n\nThe four LHC experiments are instrumented to cover a wide range of the kinematically available\nx \u2212 Q2 plane. Low-x physics is possible at central rapidities through low-Q2 Drell-Yan production and in the forward region through Drell-Yan production of photons, W and Z, as well\nas through the production of jets and exclusive final states. These measurements will test the\nStandard Model and constrain the PDFs which is essential for the understanding of many putative New Physics signals. They will also allow further investigations of QCD and may be in a\nposition to observe the onset of saturation effects.\nReferences\n[1] V.N. Gribov, L.N. Lipatov, Sov. J.Nucl.

PDFs\nextracted from DIS ep data within the standard factorisation ansatz, as\nwell as unintegrated PDFs and those describing the diffractive component of the ep scattering cross section are discussed.\n1\n\nInclusive Analyses\n\n1.1\n\nCombination of H1 and ZEUS Data\n\nDeep inelastic scattering cross sections measured at HERA provide the major input for the determination of the proton structure at low x. Using the standard QCD factorisation ansatz, the\nparton distribution functions are extracted from the doubly differential neutral (NC) and charge\n(CC) current cross sections measured as a function of the Bjorken x and of the four-momentum\ntransfer squared Q2 . Over the past two decades, global fit procedures have been developed which\ndetermine the quark and gluon PDFs of the proton using QCD DGLAP evolution equations at\nincreasingly higher orders of perturbation theory (see [1] for an overview). The QCD fits are\napplied to data sets from a number of different experiments and consider correlations among the\nexperimental data points.\nThis traditional extraction procedure however has certain drawbacks in the treatment of\nsystematic uncertainties. In particular, correlations through common systematic uncertainties,\nboth within and across data sets, represent a significant challenge. The treatment of these correlations is not unique. In the Hessian method [2], each systematic error source is treated as\nan additional fit parameter, and the parameters are fitted assuming the model, as provided by\n(N)NLO QCD, to optimise the uncertainties and to constrain the PDFs. In the Offset method\n(see e.g. [3, 4]) the data sets are shifted by the effect of each single systematic error source before\nfitting, and the resulting fits are then used to form an envelope function as an estimate of the PDF\nuncertainty. All analyses face the problem of data sets not always leading to consistent results.\nSome global QCD analyses therefore inflate the PDF uncertainties.\nThe drawbacks mentioned can be significantly reduced by averaging the cross section data\nfrom the different data sets in a model independent way prior to performing a QCD analysis. The\nH1 and ZEUS collaborations presented preliminary results of combining their HERA I data [5],\nwhere one averaged value of the cross section is provided for each measured kinematic point at\na given (x, Q2 , y). Using a method introduced in Ref. [6], the correlated systematic uncertainties\nare floated coherently allowing each experiment to calibrate the other.

In addition, a study of the global\n\u03c72 /ndf of the average and of the pull distributions provides a model independent consistency\ncheck between the experiments.\nPrior to the combination, the H1 and ZEUS data were transformed to a common grid of\n(x, Q2 ) points using ratios of cross sections calculated based on available PDF parameterisations.\nThe NC and CC data collected with the proton beam energy of E p = 820 GeV were corrected to\n920 GeV and then combined with the measurements at E p = 920 GeV.\nAs an example, the resulting NC e+ p cross section data are shown in Fig. 1. A precision\nbetter than 2% is reached in the low Q2 region. Comparisons with the fits previously performed\nby H1 and ZEUS to their own data have shown an excellent agreement.\nAt the time of this workshop, H1 presented preliminary results of the analysis of their\nHERA I e+ p data collected in 1999-2000 in the range 12 \u2264 Q2 \u2264 150 GeV2 and 2* 104 \u2264 x \u2264 0.1.\nThe data have been combined with the previously published H1 data in this region using a similar\naveraging procedure. The accuracy of the combined measurement is typically in the range of\n1.5 \u2212 2%.\nMPI08\n\n165\n\n\f1.2\n\nPDF Fit of the Combined HERA Data\n\nThe H1/ZEUS combined data set has been used as the sole input for a new NLO DGLAP PDF\nfit [7]. The consistency of the input data enables a calculation of the experimental uncertainties\nof the PDFs using the \u03c72 tolerance, \u2206\u03c72 = 1. This represents a significant advantage compared\nto the global fit analyses using both HERA and fixed target data, where increased tolerances\n\u2206\u03c72 = 50 \u2212 100 are used to account for data inconsistencies. Other advantages of using solely\nHERA data are: the absence of heavy target corrections which must be applied to the \u03bd-Fe and\n\u03bcD fixed target data, and no need to assume isospin symmetry, i.e. that d distribution in the\nproton is the same as u distribution in the neutron.\nFor the new HERAPDF 0.1 fit, the importance of correlated systematic uncertainties is no\nlonger crucial, since they are relatively small. This ensures that similar results are obtained using\neither Offset or Hessian method, or by simply combining statistical and systematic uncertainties\nin quadrature.\nA DGLAP PDF fit analysis depends on a number of model parameters, like the choice\nof the starting scale Q20 for the evolution, the form of the x dependence for PDFs at the starting\nscale, the minimum Q2 for the data to fit, Q2min , the treatment of heavy flavours etc. There are\ndifferences in the choices made by different groups, and in particular, by H1 and ZEUS in their\nfits to their own data. In this analysis, both collaborations agreed on a common set of choices,\nand variations in the choices were taken to estimate model-dependent uncertainties (see [7] for\ndetails).\nThe predictions of the fit for the NC cross section are superimposed in Fig. 1 on the combined HERA NC data set. The yellow band shows the total uncertainty including those due to\nthe model dependency. The total uncertainties of the HERAPDF 0.1 PDFs are much reduced\ncompared to the PDFs extracted from the analyses of the separate H1 and ZEUS data sets, as can\nbe seen in Fig. 2, where the new PDFs are compared to the ZEUS-JETs and H1PDF2000 PDFs.\n1.3\n\nMeasurements of F L\n\nAt high inelasticities y = Q2 /(xs), where s is the ep centre-of-mass energy squared, the inclusive DIS cross section is sensitive to the size of the structure function F L which describes the\nexchange of longitudinally polarised bosons. In the Quark Parton Model F L is zero, since due to\nhelicity and angular momentum conservation a quark with spin 12 cannot absorb a longitudinally\npolarised photon [8]. In QCD, F L differs from zero, receiving contributions from quarks and\nfrom gluons [9]. At low x (which corresponds to high y) the gluon contribution greatly exceeds\nthe quark contribution. Therefore F L is a direct measure of the gluon distribution to a very good\napproximation. An independent measurement of F L at HERA, and its comparison with predictions derived from the gluon distribution extracted from the DGLAP fits, thus represents a crucial\ntest on the validity of perturbative QCD at low x. Furthermore, depending on the particular theoretical approach adopted, whether it be a fixed order pQCD calculation, a re-summation scheme,\nor a colour dipole ansatz, there appear to be significant differences in the predicted magnitude of\nF L at low Q2 mainly due to a large uncertainty of the gluon PDF. A measurement of F L may be\nable to distinguish between these approaches.\nA direct measurement of F L requires several sets of data taken at the same x and Q2 but\n166\n\nMPI08\n\n\f2\n\nQ = 10 GeV2\n\n1\n\nQ2 = 10 GeV2\n\nZEUS-JETS Fit\n\nHERAPDF0.1 (prel.)\n\n0.8\n\ntotal uncert.\n\nexp. uncert.\n\nxuv\n\nmodel uncert.\n\nH1 PDF 2000\nexp. uncert.\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\ntotal uncert.\n\n0.4\n\nxuv\n\nHERA Structure Functions Working Group\n\n0.8\n\nApril 2008\n\nxf\n\nxf\n\n1\n\nxg (\u00d7 0.05)\n\nxdv\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\nxg (\u00d7 0.05)\n\nxdv\n\n0.2\n\nxS (\u00d7 0.05)\n\nxS (\u00d7 0.05)\n0\n10-4\n\n10-3\n\n10-2\n\n10-1\n\n1\n\nx\n\n0\n10-4\n\n10-3\n\n10-2\n\n10-1\n\n1\n\nx\n\nFig. 2: Left: PDFs from the ZEUS-JETS and H1PDF2000 fits.

Due to the relationship y = Q2 /xs this requires data to be collected\nat different centre-of-mass energies, which was done in the last year of HERA running, when\ndedicated runs were performed with lowered proton beam energies of E p = 460 and 575 GeV.\nThe first HERA measurement of F L (x, Q2 ) was reported by H1 [10] in the range 12 \u2264\nQ2 \u2264 90 GeV2 and 0.0002 \u2264 x \u2264 0.004. In this analysis, the scattered electron is reconstructed\nin the H1 backward calorimeter SpaCal. Preliminary results were presented by ZEUS in a similar\nkinematic range [11]. Both measurements show a non-zero F L and are consistent with each other\nand with the prediction of (N)NLO QCD fits. Further preliminary results were presented by H1\nin an extended range of Q2 up to 800 GeV2 , where the scattered electron is found either in the\nSpaCal or in the Liquid Argon calorimeter covering the central and forward region of the H1\ndetector [12]. These results are shown in Fig. 3.\n2\n\nUnintegrated PDFs\n\nUsing the QCD factorisation theorem, PDFs extracted from DIS data are applied for the calculation of various scattering processes at hadron colliders, in particular at the LHC. In practice, the\ninterpretation of experimental data relies for many signals on analytical calculations performed\nat a fixed order of perturbation theory, typically NLO or NNLO (see [13] for a recent review),\nas well as on Monte Carlo (MC) event simulations. The major MC programs, PYTHIA [14] and\nHERWIG [15], include leading order matrix elements for a number of processes, while effects of\nhigher orders of pQCD are simulated using parton shower models.\nFor some signatures, especially those with high multiplicity of final state objects, the complex kinematics and the large phase space available at high energies to be reached at the LHC\nMPI08\n\n167\n\n\fL\n\nproton structure function FL shown as a function of Q2 at\n\n0\n\nSpaCal SpaCal+LAr LAr\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\ntistical error, the full error bars include the uncorrelated\nmedium & high Q2\n\n0.5\n0.5\n\n-0.5\n-0.5\n\nthe given values of x.

In perturbative fixed-order calculations\nfinite-kT contributions are partially accounted for. This is usually sufficient for inclusive cross\nsections, but likely not for more exclusive final state observables. As an illustration, Fig. 4 (left)\nfrom an H1 study of D\u2217 +jet photoproduction at HERA [16] shows the cross section for this process as a function of the difference in the azimuthal angle \u2206\u03c6(D\u2217 , jet) between the D\u2217 and the jet.\nThe lower \u2206\u03c6 tail is significantly underestimated by the analytical NLO programs FMNR [17,18]\nand ZMVFNS [19, 20].\nOn the other hand, the standard MC programs are based on collinear evolution of the\ninitial state partons, supplemented by colour coherence effects for soft gluon emission. It is unknown whether the approximations involved in these methods will provide sufficient precision\nat the LHC energies, as the effects of not collinearly ordered emissions become increasingly\nimportant at low x. A theoretical framework including the finite-kT contributions makes use of\ngeneralised QCD factorisation technique which involves PDFs unintegrated not only in the longitudinal but also in the transverse momenta [21] and couples them with suitably defined off-shell\nmatrix elements. Although MC generators based on this framework [22\u201325] are generally not as\ndeveloped as the standard parton shower programs, several studies have demonstrated their potential advantages over collinear approaches for specific hadronic final states.

Inclusive diffractive processes are analysed employing various\ntechniques: (i) explicitly selecting events with a large rapidity gap; (ii) extracting the diffractive contribution from a fit to the invariant mass MX of the reconstructed hadronic system; (iii)\ntagging the scattered proton in the dedicated forward spectrometers located far away from the\nmain detectors and very close to the beam pipe (FPS in H1, LPS in ZEUS) and vetoing the proton dissociation. The different analyses are based on different statistics and are characterised\nby different systematic effects. All H1 and ZEUS analyses are broadly consistent within the\nquoted uncertainties, and the possibility of creating combined H1-ZEUS data sets, similar to the\ninclusive HERA data, is currently being considered.\nMPI08\n\n169\n\n\fDiffractive events at HERA are successfully described within the Regge framework [28], in\nwhich the rapidity gap is explained by the exchange of a colourless object lying on the Pomeron\ntrajectory. The description of the cross section is based on a two-step factorisation approach.\nThe first step is the standard QCD factorisation, describing the cross section as a convolution\nof the matrix element for the hard scale boson-quark interaction with a PDF in the proton. The\nsecond step describes the PDF as a product of the universal Pomeron flux in the proton with\nthe diffractive PDF (DPDF). The Pomeron flux is described by the respective trajectory and\ndepends solely on the fraction of the proton momentum carried by the Pomeron xIP and the\nfour-momentum transfer squared at the proton vertex t. The DPDF provides, at a given Q2 , the\nparton content of the Pomeron for a given longitudinal momentum fraction \u03b2 = x/xIP carried by\nthe struck quark. Additionally, a small additional term in the second factorisation describes the\nReggeon exchange component.\nThe second factorisation is an empirical assumption which is not proven theoretically.\nVarious experimental studies at HERA have shown this ansatz to work to a good approximation.\nHowever, a recent ZEUS study [29] revealed violation of this factorisation, as shown in Fig. 6.\nLooking in particular at the xIP intervals in the central column, one observes a clear change in the\nQ2 slope of the structure function xIP F2D (xIP , \u03b2, Q2 ) which is defined similarly to the conventional\nstructure function F2 in inclusive DIS. The effect is rather mild, as compared to the typical\nprecision of the diffractive measurements, and thus should not strongly affect QCD analyses of\ndiffractive PDFs which are based on this assumption.\nThe diffractive PDFs, defined in this framework, were extracted from inclusive diffractive\ndata by H1 [30] in an NLO DGLAP QCD analysis. While the singlet quark distribution is well\nconstrained by the fit, there is a significant uncertainty of the gluon distribution especially at high\nzIP . Here, zIP is the longitudinal momentum fraction of the parton entering the hard sub-process\nwith respect to the diffractive exchange, such that zIP = \u03b2 for the lowest order quark-parton\nmodel process, whereas 0 < \u03b2 < zIP for higher order processes. An additional constraint was\nobtained from the analysis of diffractive dijet production in DIS at HERA [31]. The dijet data\nwhich are sensitive to the gluon distribution at high zIP have shown a remarkable consistency\nwith the predictions from a fit of inclusive diffraction. Including these data into a combined\nanalyses resulted in a set of the most precise diffractive PDFs currently available. Examples of\nthe H1 2007 Jets DPDF fit predictions for the singlet quark and gluon diffractive PDFs at different\nfactorisation scales \u03bc2f squared, where \u03bc2f = Q2 in inclusive diffraction, are shown in Fig. 7.\nReferences\n[1] R.

Kowalski\nDeutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron, DESY\nNotkestr. 85,\n22607 Hamburg, Germany\nE-mail: Henri.Kowalski@desy.de\nAbstract\nThis talk describes the measurement of F2 and inclusive and exclusive\ndiffractive cross sections in the low-x region by HERA experiments.\nThe abundance of diffractive reactions observed at HERA indicates\nthe presence of perturbative multi-ladder exchanges. The exclusive\ndiffractive vector-meson and diffractive dijet production are discussed\nin terms of dipole models which connect the measurement of F2 with\ndiffractive processes and in which multiple exchanges and saturation\nprocesses are natural.\n1\n\nF2 and Diffraction at HERA\n\nThe HERA machine is a large electron-proton collider, in which\nelectrons with energy of 27.5 GeV scatter on protons of 920 GeV.\nThe collision products are recorded by the two large, multipurpose experiments ZEUS and H1. The detectors consist of inner tracking detectors surrounded by large calorimeters measuring the spatial energy distribution, event by event. The calorimeters are in addition surrounded by muon detector systems. Fig. 1\nshows, as an example, a picture of a high Q2 DIS event measured by the H1 and ZEUS detectors. From the amount and\npositions of energy deposited by the scattered electron and the\nhadronic debris, the total \u03b3 \u2217 p CMS energy, W , and the virtuality of the exchanged photon, Q2 , are determined. Counting the\nevents at given Q2 and W 2 allows the determination of the total cross section for the collisions of the virtual photon with the\nFig. 1: Two examples of DIS\nproton, \u03c3\u03b3 \u2217 p (W 2 , Q2 ), and in turn the structure function,\nZR View\n\nQ2\n\u03c3\u03b3 \u2217 p (W 2 , Q2 )\nF2 (x, Q2 ) = 2\n4\u03c0 \u03b1em\n\nevents seen in the H1 (left) and\nZEUS (right) detector.\n\nwith x \u2248 Q2 /W 2 when Q2 \ufffd W 2 .\n\nDeep inelastic scattering and the structure function F2 have a simple and intuitive interpretation when viewed in the fast moving proton frame. The incoming electron scatters on the\nproton by emitting an intermediate photon with a virtuality Q2 . The incoming proton consists\nof a fluctuating cloud of quarks, antiquarks and gluons. Since the lifetime of the virtual photon\n\nMPI08\n\n173\n\n\fis much shorter than the lifetime of the q q\u0304-pair, the photon scans the \"frozen\" parton cloud and\npicks up quarks with longitudinal momentum x, see Fig. 2. F2 measures then the density of partons with a size which is larger than the photon size, 1/Q, at a given x. Fig. 3 shows the structure\nfunction F2 as measured by H1, ZEUS and fixed target experiments for selected Q2 values [1].\nIn the low-x regime, F2 measured at HERA exhibits a\ne\ne\nstriking behavior. At low Q2 values, Q2 < 1 GeV2 , where the\n\u03b3\nphoton is large, F2 rises only moderately with diminishing x,\np\nwhereas as Q2 increases, i.e. the photon becomes smaller, the\nrise of F2 accelerates quickly. The rise of F2 at low Q2 values,\ni.e. when the photon is of similar size as a hadron, corresponds to Fig. 2: Schematic view of deep inthe rise of the hadronic cross sections with energy. The fast rise elastic scattering (DIS).\nat large Q2 indicates the strong growth of the cloud of partons in the proton. The onset of the fast\ngrowth at Q2 values larger than 1 GeV2 indicates that these partons are of perturbative origin.\n*\n\nFor sufficiently large Q2 perturbative QCD\nprovides a set of leading-twist linear evolution\nF\nequations (DGLAP) which describe the variation\n2\n2\nof the cross section as a function of Q ; see Fig. 4.\nQ = 35\n1.75\n150\n12\nMoreover, a closer look at the x-dependence of the\n1.5\n4.5\nparton splitting functions has led to the prediction\n1.25\n2.7\nthat the gluon density, at small x, should rise with\n1\n1.3\n1/x. This rise should translate into a growth with\n0.75\nenergy of the total \u03b3 \u2217 p cross section or, equiva0.65\n0.5\nlently, of F2 with diminishing x. The data show\n0.25\nthat the growth of F2 starts in the low-x regime\n0.1\n0\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n1\nwhich indicates that this is mainly due to the abunx\ndant gluon production.

The intact forward proton corresponds in optics to the forward white spot observed in the\ncenter of the disc shadow. The measurement of diffractive reactions requires the determination of\ntwo additional variables: the diffractive mass, MX , and the square of the four-momentum transferred by the outgoing proton, t. The variable MX , which is equal to the invariant mass of all particles emitted in the reaction with exception of the outgoing proton (or the proton dissociated system),\nZEUS\nxf\n\nis determined from energy depositions recorded by the\ncentral detectors of the H1 and ZEUS experiments. The variable t is determined by forward detectors, which measure the\nmomentum of the outgoing diffractively scattered proton. In\nexclusive diffractive vector-meson production the t variable\ncan also be determined from the precise measurement of the\nmomenta of the vector-meson decay products measured in\nthe tracking chamber systems of central detectors.\n\n0.8\n2\n\nQ = 10 GeV 2\n0.7\n\nZEUS-O (prel.) 94-00\nuncorrelated error\ncorrelated error\nmodel dependence error\n\n0.6\n\nMRST 2001\nZEUS-S\n\n0.5\n0.4\n\nxu v\n\nxg ( \u00d7 0.05)\n\nxd v\n\n0.3\n0.2\n\nxS ( \u00d7 0.05)\n0.1\n\n2 distribution alThe analysis of the observed ln MX\nx\nlows a separation of diffractive and non-diffractive events\nas indicated in Fig. 7.

In the language of QCD diagrams, at low-x\nand not so small Q2 , the total cross section or F2 is dominated by the abundant gluon emission as\ndescribed by the single ladder exchange shown in Fig. 4; the ladder structure also illustrates the\nlinear DGLAP evolution equations that are used to describe the F2 data. In the region of small x\ngluonic ladders are expected to dominate over quark ladders. The cut line in Fig. 4 marks the final\nstates produced in a DIS event: a cut parton (gluon) hadronizes and leads to jets or particles seen\nin the detector. It is generally expected that partons produced from a single chain are unlikely\nto generate large rapidity gaps between them, since large gaps are exponentially suppressed as a\nfunction of the gap size. This is a general property of QCD evolution equations of the DGLAP,\nBFKL or other types.\n\nIn the single ladder contribution of\nZEUS\nQ = 8 GeV\nQ = 27 GeV\nFig. 4, diffractive final states can, thereQ = 14 GeV\nQ = 60 GeV\nSatur.

A significant contribution from perturbative multi-ladder exchanges should be present, in particular\nfrom the double ladder exchange of Fig. 10.

These models are explicitly built on the idea of summing over multiple exchanges of\nsingle ladders.

In the proton rest frame, the dipole life-time is\nmuch longer than the life-time of its interaction with the target proton.\nTherefore, the interaction is assumed to proceed in three stages: first\nthe incoming virtual photon fluctuates into a quark-antiquark pair, then\nthe q q\u0304 pair elastically scatters on the proton, and finally the q q\u0304 pair\nrecombines to form a virtual photon. The amplitude for the complete\nprocess is simply the product of these three processes.\n\n\u03b3*\n\n\u03b3*\n\np\n\np\n\nFig. 10: The double gluon\n\nladder contribution to the inclusive diffractive \u03b3 \u2217 p cross\nsection.\n\nThe amplitude of the incoming virtual photon to fluctuate into a quark-antiquark pair is\ngiven by the photon wave function \u03c8, which is determined from light cone perturbation theory\nto leading order in the fermionic charge (for simplicity, the indices of the quark and antiquark\nhelicities are suppressed).

Golec-Biernat and M. W\u00fcsthoff (GBW) [6] that a simple ansatz for\nthe dipole cross section integrated over the impact parameter b, \u03c3qq\u0304 , is able to describe simultaneously the total inclusive and diffractive DIS cross sections:\n\u03c3qGBW\n= \u03c30 [1 \u2212 exp(\u2212r 2 /4R02 )]\nq\u0304\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03c30 is a constant and R0 denotes the x dependent saturation radius R02 = (x/x0 )\u03bbGBW *\n(1/GeV 2 ). The parameters \u03c30 = 23 mb, \u03bbGBW and x0 = 3 * 10\u22124 were determined from a fit\nto the data. Although the dipole model is theoretically well justified for small size dipoles only,\nthe GBW model provides a good description of data from medium size Q2 values (\u223c30 GeV2 )\ndown to low Q2 (\u223c0.1 GeV2 ). The inverse of the saturation radius R0 is analogous to the gluon\ndensity. The exponent \u03bbGBW determines therefore the growth of the total and diffractive cross\nsections with decreasing x. For dipole sizes which are large in comparison to R0 the dipole cross\nsection saturates by approaching a constant value \u03c30 , which becomes independent of \u03bbGBW . It\nis a characteristic of the model that a good description of data is due to large saturation effects,\ni.e. the strong growth due to the factor (1/x)\u03bbGBW is, for large dipoles, significantly flattened by\nthe exponentiation in eq. (9).\nThe assumption of dipole saturation provided an attractive theoretical background for investigation of the transition from the perturbative to non-perturbative regime in the HERA data.\nDespite the appealing simplicity and success of the GBW model it suffers from clear shortcomings. In particular it does not include scaling violation, i.e. at large Q2 it does not match with\nQCD evolution (DGLAP). Therefore, Bartels, Golec-Biernat and Kowalski (BGBK) [7] proposed a modification of the original ansatz of eq.( 9) by replacing 1/R02 by a gluon density with\nexplicit DGLAP evolution:\n\u03c3qBGBK\n= \u03c30 [1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03c0 2 r 2 \u03b1s (\u03bc2 )xg(x, \u03bc2 )/3\u03c30 )]\nq\u0304\n\n(10)\n\nThe scale of the gluon density, \u03bc2 , was assumed to be \u03bc2 = C/r 2 + \u03bc20 , and the density was\nevolved according to DGLAP equations.\nThe BGBK form of the dipole cross section led to significantly better fits to the HERA F2\ndata than the original GBW model, especially in the region of larger Q2 . The good agreement\nof the original model with the DIS diffractive HERA data was also preserved, as seen from the\ncomparison of the predictions of the model with data for the ratio of the diffractive to the total\ncross section, Fig. 8.\nThe BGBK analysis found, surprisingly, that there exist two distinct solutions giving very\ngood description of HERA data, depending on the quark mass in the photon wave function.\nThe first solution is obtained assuming mq = 140 MeV and leads to the initial gluon density\ndistribution with the value of exponent \u03bbg = 0.28, which is very similar to the \u03bbGBW . As in\nthe original model, the good agreement with data is due to substantial saturation effects. In the\nsecond solution, mq \u2248 0, and the value of the exponent is very different, \u03bbg = \u22120.41 . The\ninitial gluon density no longer rises at small x, it is valence-like, and QCD evolution plays a\nmuch more significant role than in the first solution.\nMPI08\n\n179\n\n\fThe DGLAP evolution, which is\ngenerally used in the analysis of HERA\ndata, may not be appropiate when x approaches the saturation region. Therefore, Iancu, Itakura and Munier (IIM) [8]\nproposed a new saturation model, the\nColour Glass Condensate model, in\nwhich gluon saturation effects are incorporated via an approximate solution of\nthe Balitsky-Kovchegov equation.

Both models find strong saturation effects in HERA data comparable to the\nGBW model and the first solution of the BGBK model.\nAll approaches to dipole saturation discussed so far ignored a possible impact parameter\n(IP) dependence of the dipole cross section. This dependence was introduced by Kowalski and\nTeaney (KT) [10], who assumed that the dipole cross section is a function of the opacity \u03a9:\nd\u03c3qq\n=2\nd2 b\n\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\n\u03a9\n1 \u2212 exp(\u2212 ) .\n2\n\n(11)\n\nAt small x the opacity \u03a9 can be directly related to the gluon density, xg(x, \u03bc2 ), and the transverse\nprofile of the proton, T (b):\n\u03a9=\n\n\u03c02 2\nr \u03b1s (\u03bc2 ) xg(x, \u03bc2 ) T (b).\nNC\n\n(12)\n\nThe transverse profile is assumed to be of the form:\nT (b) =\n\n1\nexp(\u2212b2 /2BG ),\n2\u03c0BG\n\n(13)\n\nsince the Fourier transform of T (b) has the exponential form:\n\u2217\n\nd\u03c3V\u03b3 Mp\n= exp(\u2212BG |t|)\ndt\n\n(14)\n\nThe formula of eq. (11) and (12) is called the Glauber-Mueller dipole cross section. The diffractive cross section of this type was used around 50 years ago to study the diffractive dissociation\nof the deuterons by Glauber and reintroduced by A. Mueller [11] to describe dipole scattering in\ndeep inelastic processes.\nThe parameters of the gluon density are determined from the fit to the total inclusive DIS\ncross section, as shown in Fig. 11 [10]. The transverse profile was determined from the exclusive\n180\n\nMPI08\n\n\fdiffractive J/\u03a8 cross sections shown in the same figure. In this approach the charm quark was\nexplicitly taken into account with the mass mc = 1.25 GeV.\nFor a small value of \u03a9 the dipole cross section, eq. (11), is equal to \u03a9 and therefore\nproportional to the gluon density. This allows one to identify the opacity with the single Pomeron\nexchange amplitude of Fig. 4.\nThe KT model with parameters determined in this way has predictive properties which go\nbeyond the models discussed so far; it allows a description of the other measured reactions, e.g.\nthe charm structure function [12] or elastic diffractive J/\u03a8 production [13] shown in Fig. 12.\nZEUS\nIP Sat-Mod, mc= 1.3 GeV\n\nF2\n\nc\n\nThe initial gluon\ndistribution determined\nin the model is valencelike, with \u03bbg = \u22120.12\nand the fit pushes the\nquark mass to small values, mq \u2248 50 MeV.

This behaviour is presumably due to the assumption of the Gaussian-like\nproton shape, eq. (13). In the tail of the Gaussian, the gluon density is low, but the relative contribution of the tail to the cross section is large. The saturation effects cannot therefore be as large\nas in the GBW-like models (i.e. BGBK-1, IIM, FS). In addition, as noted in the KT paper and\nalso in the Thorne analysis [14], the introduction of charm in the analysis of HERA data lowers\nthe gluon density and therefore diminishes the saturation effects. Nevertheless, the KT analysis\nshows that in the center of the proton (b \u2248 0) the saturation effects are similar to the ones in\nthe GBW-like models in which charm is properly taken into account. This can be seen from the\nevaluation of the saturation scale in the center of the proton in the KT paper and the comparison\nto the value of the saturation scale evaluated with charm in the original GBW paper.\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n10\n\n3\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\nExclusive Diffractive Vector-Meson Production\n\nThe exclusive diffractive vector-meson production is very interesting because, in the low-x region, it is driven by the square of the gluon density. It was, therefore, investigated by many\nauthors [10,15\u201320]. In addition, the information contained in the Q2 , W and t dependence of the\ncross sections allows to determine vector-meson wave functions together with the proton shape.\nThe analysis can also be performed separately for the longitudinal and transverse photons.\nThe recent analysis of vector-meson production by Kowalski, Motyka and Watt (KMW) [21]\nshows that it is possible to describe the measured differential cross sections making simple assumptions about the vector-meson wave functions [15, 19]. The analysis shows that using the\nMPI08\n\n181\n\n\fgluon density determined from the total cross sections and the size of the interaction region determined from the t distribution of the J/\u03a8 meson at Q2 = 0, it is possible to simultaneously\ndescribe not only the shape of various differential cross sections as a function of Q2 , W and t\nbut also their absolute magnitude. In this analysis the assumption that vector-meson size should\nbe much smaller than proton size was relaxed. Following the work of Bartels, Golec-Biernat and\nPeters [22] the Fourier transform of eq. (7) was modified to take into account the finite size of\nthe vector meson:\n\ufffd \u2192 exp(\u2212i(\ufffdb + (1 \u2212 z)\ufffdr ) * \u2206).\n\ufffd\nexp(\u2212i\ufffdb * \u2206)\n\n(15)\n\nIn this way, the information about the size of the vector meson, contained in the wave function,\nis contributing to the size of the interaction region BD , together with the size of the proton.\nAs an example\n10\nof results obtained\n\u03b3 *p \u2192 J/\u03c8 p\n\u03b3 *p \u2192 \u03c6 p\n\u03b3 *p \u2192 \u03c1 p\n10\n10\nH1 99-00\nZEUS 98-00\nin this analysis\nH1 95-96\nZEUS 98-00\n10\nFig. 13 shows\n10\n10\nthe comparison\nof KMW model\n10\n1\n1\npredictions for the\ntotal exclusive diffrac1\n10\n10\ntive vector-meson\n10\n10\n10\n1\n10\nQ + M (GeV )\nQ + M (GeV )\nQ + M (GeV )\ncross section and\nthe size of the in7\n8\n10\n\u03b3 *p \u2192 J/\u03c8 p\n\u03b3 *p \u2192 \u03c6 p\n\u03b3 *p \u2192 \u03c1 p\n9\nteraction region\nH1 99-00\n6\n7\nZEUS 98-00\nH1 95-96\nZEUS 96-97,98-00\n8\nwith data.

Inclusive diffraction, diffractive jet process and exclusive diffractive\nvector-meson production are connected to inclusive deep inelastic scattering and, in the dipole\npicture, can be successfully derived from the measured F2 . In the dipole approach, the Pomeron\n182\n\nMPI08\n\n\fis essentially of the perturbative type, since the dipole models are explicitly built on the idea of\nsumming over multiple exchanges of single ladders.\nInclusive diffraction and diffractive dijet production are also well described in the diffractive parton density approach, in which the Pomeron could be of non-perturbative origin. However, the effective Pomeron intercept extracted from diffractive DIS data lies significantly above\nthe soft Pomeron intercept [3, 5], indicating a substantial contribution to diffractive DIS from\nperturbative Pomeron exchange. In addition, the initial scale chosen for the analysis is relatively\nhigh, Q20 = 3 GeV2 . At this scale F2 exhibits a clear growth with diminishing x indicating that\nthe exchanged Pomeron should be of perturbative type.\nThe good agreement between the diffractive parton density and dipole model analysis in\nthe description of diffractive dijets indicates that both approaches, although seemingly different,\nare not really distinct. An attempt to combine these two approaches is recently discussed in\nRef. [23].\nReferences\n[1] G. Wolf, International Europhysics Conference on HEP, 2001 .\n[2] ZEUS Collab., J.

We\nreport on the diffractive structure function obtained from dijet production in the range 0 < Q2 < 10, 000 GeV2 , and on the |t| distribution in\nthe region 0 < |t| < 1 GeV2 for both soft and hard diffractive events\nup to Q2 \u2248 4, 500 GeV2 . Results on single diffractive W/Z production, forward jets, and central exclusive production of both dijets and\ndiphotons are also presented.\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nDiffractive processes are characterized by the presence of large rapidity regions not filled with\nparticles (\"rapidity gaps\"). Traditionally discussed in terms of the \"Pomeron\", diffraction can be\ndescribed as an exchange of a combination of quarks and gluons carrying the quantum numbers\nof the vacuum [1].\nAt the Fermilab Tevatron collider, proton-antiproton collisions have been used to study\n\u221a\ndiffractive interactions in Run I (1992-1996) at an energy of s = 1.8 TeV and continue in\n\u221a\nRun II (2003-present) with new and upgraded detectors at s = 1.96 TeV. The goal of the\nCDF experimental program at the Tevatron is to provide results help decipher the QCD nature of\nhadronic diffractive interactions, and to measure exclusive production rates which could be used\nto establish the benchmark for exclusive Higgs production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).\nThe study of diffractive events has been performed by tagging events either with a rapidity gap\nor with a leading hadron. The experimental apparatus includes a set of forward detectors [2] that\nextend the rapidity [3] coverage to the forward region. The Miniplug (MP) calorimeters cover\nthe region 3.5 < |\u03b7| < 5.1; the Beam Shower Counters (BSC) surround the beam-pipe at various\nlocations and detect particles in the region 5.4 < |\u03b7| < 7.4; the Roman Pot spectrometer (RPS)\ntags the leading hadron scattered from the interaction point after losing a fractional momentum\napproximately in the range 0.03 < \u03be < 0.10.\n2\n\nDiffractive dijet production\n\nThe gluon and quark content of the interacting partons can be investigated by comparing single\ndiffractive (SD) and non diffractive (ND) events. SD events are triggered on a leading anti-proton\nin the RPS and at least one jet, while the ND trigger requires only a jet in the calorimeters. The\nratio of SD to ND dijet production rates (Njj ) is proportional to the ratio of the corresponding\n\u2020\n\n184\n\nnow at LIP Lisbon, Portugal\n\nMPI08\n\n\fN SD (x,Q2 ,\u03be,t)\n\nF SD (x,Q2 ,\u03be,t)\n\nstructure functions (Fjj ), R SD (x, \u03be, t) = jjNjj (x,Q2 ) \u2248 jjFjj (x,Q2 ) , and can be measured\nND\nas a function of the Bjorken scaling variable x \u2261 xBj [4]. In the ratio, jet energy corrections\napproximately cancel out, thus avoiding dependence on Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. Diffractive dijet rates are suppressed by a factor of O(10) with respect to expectations based on the\nproton PDF obtained from diffractive deep inelastic scattering at the HERA ep collider [1]. The\nSD/ND ratios (i.e. gap fractions) of dijets, W, b-quark, J/\u03c8 production are all approximately\n1%, indicating that the suppression factor is the same for all processes and it is related to the gap\nformation.\n\n10\n\nCDF Run II Preliminary\n2\n\nQ \u2248 100 GeV\n2\n\n\u03c7 2 / ndf\n\n23.26 / 12\n\nQ \u2248 400 GeV\nProb\n\n2\n\nd\u03c3/dt [arbitrary units]\n\nRatio ( SD / \u0394\u03be ) / ND\n\nIn Run II, the jet ET spectrum extends to ETjet \u2248 100 GeV, and results are consistent with\nthose of Run I [5], hence confirming a breakdown of factorization. Preliminary results indicate\nthat the ratio does not strongly depend on ET2 \u2261 Q2 in the range 100 < Q2 < 10, 000 GeV2\n(Fig. 1, left). The relative normalization uncertainty cancels out in the ratio, and the results\nindicate that the Q2 evolution, mostly sensitive to the gluon density, is similar for the proton and\nthe Pomeron. A novel technique [6] to align the RPS is used to measure the diffractive dijet cross\nsection as a function of the t-slope in the range up to Q2 \ufffd 4, 500 GeV/c2 (Fig. 1, right). The\nshape of the t distribution does not depend on the Q2 value, in the region 0 \u2264 |t| \u2264 1 GeV2 .\nMoreover, the |t| distributions do not show diffractive minima, which could be caused by the\ninterference of imaginary and real parts of the interacting partons.\n\n2\n2\n\n0.0256\n\n2\n\nQ \u2248 1,600 GeV\nConst 0.01031 \u00b1 0.0009656\n\nslope\n\n1.027 \u00b1 0.04422\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\nQ \u2248 3,000 GeV\n\n1\n\nQ \u2248 6,000 GeV\n2\n\nQ \u2248 10,000 GeV\n\n2\n\n-1\n\n10\n\nCDF Run II Preliminary\n2\n\n10\n\n2\n\n2\n\n10\n\n2\n\n3\n\n2\n\n0.03< \u03bep <0.09\n2\n\n*\n\njet1\n\nRPS\n\nQ \u2261 <E*T >2, <ET >=(ET +Ejet2\nT )/2\n\n0.05< \u03bep <0.08\n\noverall syst. uncertainty: \u00b1 20% (norm), \u00b1 6% (slope)\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\nx Bj 10\n\n-1\n\njet1\n\n*\n\n2\n\nQ \u2261 <E*T>2, <ET>=(ET +Ejet2\nT )/2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n2\n\nRPS+Jet20 (Q ~900GeV )\n\nCAL\n\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\nRPS+Jet5 (Q ~225GeV )\n\nRPS+Jet50 (Q ~4,500GeV )\n\n10\n-2\n\nRPS inclusive\n\nstatistical uncertainties only\n4\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n2\n\n1\n\n|t| (GeV/c)\n\nFig. 1: Left: Ratio of diffractive to non-diffractive dijet event rates as a function of xBj (momentum fraction of struck\nparton in the anti-proton) for different values of E T 2 \u2261 Q2 ; Right: Measured |t|-distributions for soft and hard\ndiffractive events.\n\n3\n\nDiffractive W/Z production\n\nStudies of diffractive production of the W/Z bosons are an additional handle to the understanding\nof diffractive interactions. At leading order (LO) diffractive W/Z bosons are produced by a\nquark interaction in the Pomeron. Production through a gluon can take place at NLO, which is\nsuppressed by a factor \u03b1s and can be distinguished by the presence of an additional jet.\nIn Run I, the CDF experiment measured a diffractive W boson event rate RW = 1.15 \u00b1\n0.51 (stat)\u00b10.20 (syst)%. Combining the RW measurement with the dijet production event\nMPI08\n\n185\n\n\frate (which takes place both through quarks and gluons) and with the b-production rate allows\nthe determination of the gluon fraction carried by the Pomeron which can be estimated to be\n54+16\n\u221214 % [7].\n\nIn Run II, the RPS provides an accurate measurement of the fractional energy loss (\u03be) of\nthe leading hadron (Fig. 2, left), removing the ambiguity of the gap survival probability. The\ninnovative approach of the analysis [8] takes advantage of the full W \u2192 l\u03bd event kinematics including the neutrino. The missing transverse energy (\ufffd ET ) is calculated as usual from\nall calorimeter towers, and the neutrino direction (i.e. \u03b7\u03bd ) is obtained from the comparison\nbetween the fractional energy loss measured in the Roman Pot spectrometer (\u03be RP S ) and the\n\ufffdET\n* e\u2212\u03b7\u03bd . The reconsame value estimated from the calorimeters (\u03be cal ): \u03be RP S \u2212 \u03be cal = \u221a\ns\nstructed W mass (Fig. 2, right) yields MW = 80.9 \u00b1 0.7 GeV/c2 , in good agreement with\nthe world average value of MW = 80.398 \u00b1 0.025 GeV/c2 [9]. After applying the corrections due to the RPS acceptance, trigger and track reconstruction efficiencies, and taking into\naccount the effect of multiple interactions, both W and Z diffractive event rates are calculated:\nRW = 0.97 \u00b1 0.05(stat) \u00b1 0.11(syst)%, and RZ =0.85\u00b10.20 (stat)\u00b10.11 (syst)%.\n\nFig. 2: Calorimeter \u03be cal distribution in W events with a reconstructed Roman Pot track (left). Due to the neutrino,\n\u03be cal < \u03be RP S is expected. The difference \u03be RP S \u2212 \u03be cal is used to determine the W boson mass (right).\n\n4\n\nForward jets\n\nAn interesting process is dijet production in double diffractive (DD) dissociation. DD events are\ncharacterized by the presence of a large central rapidity gap and are presumed to be due to the\nexchange of a color singlet state with vacuum quantum numbers. A study of the dependence of\nthe event rate on the width of the gap was performed using Run I data with small statistics. In\nRun II larger samples are available. Typical luminosities (L \u2248 1 \u00f7 10 \u00d7 1031 cm\u22122 sec\u22121 ) during\nnormal Run II run conditions hamper the study of gap \"formation\" due to multiple interactions\nwhich effectively \"kill\" the gap signature. Central rapidity gap production was studied in soft\n186\n\nMPI08\n\n\fand hard diffractive events collected during a special low luminosity run (L \u2248 1029 cm\u22122 sec\u22121 ).\nFigure 3 (left) shows a comparison of the gap fraction rates, as function of the gap width (i.e.\n\u2206\u03b7) for minimum bias (MinBias), and MP jet events. Event rate fraction is calculated as the\nratio of the number of events in a given rapidity gap region divided by all events: Rgap =\nNgap /Nall . The fraction is approximately 10% in soft diffractive events, and approximately 1%\nin jet events. Shapes are similar for both soft and hard processes, and gap fraction rates decrease\nwith increasing \u2206\u03b7. The MP jets of gap events are produced back-to-back (Fig. 3, right).\n\nCDF II Preliminary\n\n\u0394\u03c6 for MPp\u2022MPp jets with CCAL\u2022PCAL gap\n\nNumber of events\n\ndRgap\n\u00d7 Nbins (2.2<\u0394\u03b7<6.6)\nd\u0394\u03b7\n\nGap Fraction in events with a CCAL gap\nMinBias\n\n1\n\njet1,2\n\n> 2GeV\n\njet1,2\n\n> 4GeV\n\nMPp\u2022MPp Jets, ET\n\nR gap\u2261 N gap /N all\n\nMPp\u2022MPp Jets, ET\n\n3.5<| \u03b7jet1,2 |<5.1\n\n-1\n\n10\n\nCCAL gap\nrequired\n\n60\n\nCDF II Preliminary\n\n50\n40\n\n-3.3 < \u03b7gap<3.3\n\n30\n\n10-2\n\n20\n10-3\n10\n10-4\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n\u0394\u03b7=\u03b7max-\u03b7min\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n\u0394\u03c6=|\u03c6jet1-\u03c6jet2 | (rad)\n\nFig. 3: Left: Event rate gap fraction defined as Rgap = Ngap /Nall , for minimum bias (MinBias) and MP jet events\nwith ET > 2(4) GeV; Right: Azimuthal angle difference \u2206\u03c6 distribution of the two leading jets in a DD event with\na central rapidity gap (|\u03b7 gap | < 3.3).\n\n5\n\nExclusive production\n\nThe first observation of the process of exclusive dijet production can be used as a benchmark to\nestablish predictions on exclusive diffractive Higgs production, a process with a much smaller\ncross section [10]. A wide range of predictions was attempted to estimate the cross section for\nexclusive dijet and Higgs production. In Run I, the CDF experiment set a limit on exclusive jet\nproduction [11]. First observation of this process was made in Run II. The search strategy is based\non measuring the dijet mass fraction (Rjj ), defined as the ratio of the two leading jet invariant\nmass divided by the total mass calculated using all calorimeter towers. An exclusive signal is\nexpected to appear at large Rjj values (Fig. 4, left). The method used to extract the exclusive\nsignal from the Rjj distribution is based on fitting the data to MC simulations. The quark/gluon\ncomposition of dijet final states can be exploited to provide additional hints on exclusive dijet\nproduction. The Rjj distribution can be constructed using inclusive or b-tagged dijet events.\nIn the latter case, as the gg \u2192 q q\u0304 is strongly suppressed for mq /M 2 \u2192 0 (Jz = 0 selection\nrule), only gluon jets will be produced exclusively and heavy flavor jet production is suppressed.\nFigure 4 (center) illustrates the method that was used to determine the heavy-flavor composition\nof the final sample. The falling distribution at large values of Rjj (Rjj > 0.7) indicates the\nsuppression of the exclusive b-jet events. The CDF result favors the model in Ref. [12] (Fig. 4,\nright). Details can be found in Ref. [13].\nMPI08\n\n187\n\n\f10-2\n\n10-3\n\n10-4\n0\n\nPOMWIG + Background\nPOMWIG : CDF\u2295H1\nPOMWIG : CDF\nPOMWIG : H1-fit2\nPOMWIG : ZEUS-LPS\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.1\n\nSystematic Uncertainty\n\n0.08\n0.06\n\nSDp : 0.03 < \u03bep < 0.1\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nsystematic uncertainty\n\n1\n\n10-2\n\nGAPp : 5.5 < \u03b7gap < 7.5\njet\n\n0\n0\n\n10\n\n10-1\n\n0.04\n0.02\n\nExHuME (hadron level)\nDefault\nDerived from CDF\nmin\nRun II \u03c3excl\n(ET )\njj\n\n102\n\nDPE = SD p + GAP p\n\n10 < pT (RAW) < 40 GeV/c,\n\nRjj = Mjj / MX\n\nd\u03c3excl\npb\njj\ndMjj GeV/c2\n\n10\n\n\u3008 b-Tag/Inclusive Ratio \u3009\n\ndN / N\n\nCDF Run II Preliminary\nIDPE data (stat. only)\nBackground\n\n-1\n\n|\u03b7jet1, 2 | < 2.5\n3.6 < \u03b7gap < 5.9\n0.03 < \u03bep < 0.08\n\n|\u03b7jet | < 1.5\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9\n\n1\n\nRjj = Mjj/MX\n\n10-3\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n2\n\nMjj (GeV/c )\n\nFig. 4: Left: Dijet mass fraction Rjj in inclusive DPE dijet data.

All other calorimeter towers are required\nto be below threshold. In the di-electron event selection, the two tracks pointing at the energy\nclusters are allowed. The CDF experiment reported the first observation of exclusive e+ e\u2212 production [14]. A total of 16 \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 candidate events are observed, consistent with QED\nexpectations. Exclusive di-photon events can be produced through the process gg \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3. Three\ncandidate events were selected, where one is expected from background sources (i.e. \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ).\nA 95%C.L. cross section limit of 410 pb can be set [15], about ten times larger than expectations [16].\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nThe results obtained during the past two decades have led the way to the identification of striking\ncharacteristics in diffraction. Moreover, they have significantly contributed to an understanding\nof diffraction in terms of the underlying inclusive parton distribution functions. The regularities\nfound in the Tevatron data and the interpretations of the measurements can be extrapolated to\nthe LHC era. At the LHC, the diffractive Higgs can be studied but not without challenges, as\ntriggering and event acceptance will be difficult. Still, future research at the Tevatron and at the\nLHC holds much promise for further understanding of diffractive processes.\n7\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nMy warmest thanks to the the people who strenuously contributed to the diffractive multi-year\nproject and to INFN for supporting my participation at the workshop.\nReferences\n[1] K.

It follows from kt factorization theorems\nthat transverse momenta of partons are increasing within the fragmentation region, that regime of 100% absorption dominates in the scattering at zero impact parameters. Biconcave form of rapid hadron and two\nphase structure of hadronic final states are explained. We outline here\nimpact of understood QCD phenomena on the probability of processes\nwith large rapidity gaps.\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe main challenge of LHC physics is to discover new particles (Higgs boson, supersymmetric\nparticles...) and novel QCD phenomena. One of barriers for a such study is the necessity to\nmodel QCD environment. Usually this is made within Monte Carlo approaches which accounts\nfor the understood properties of QCD (see also [1,2] at this conference). The main origin of complications is evident: cross sections of QCD processes are rapidly increasing with energy. Really\ndata on the cross sections of soft QCD processes can be described as \u03c3 \u221d (s/so )2\u03b1P (t=0)\u22122 i.e.\nas due to the exchange by Pomeron with the intercept \u03b1P (t = 0) = 1 + \u03b4 where \u03b4 = 0.08 \u2212 .01.\nSimilarily cross sections of DIS processes with the virtuality Q2 observed at FNAL and at HERA\ncan be fitted as the exchange by hard \"Pomeron\" with the intercept \u03b1P (t = 0) = 1+ \u03b4hard where\n\u03b4hard (Q2 \u2248 10GeV 2 ) \u2248 0.2 and increasing with increase of Q2 . pQCD formulae are more complicated but in the important kinematical domain can be fitted in this form also. Different energy\ndependence of soft and hard QCD processes leads to change of proportions between soft and\nhard QCD contributions, to the energy dependence of QCD environment.\nRapid increase with collision energy of the radius of soft QCD interaction b2 = Bo +\n2\u03b1\ufffdP ln(s/so ) allows experimental separation of peripheral and central collisions (b2 \u2248 Bo at\nLHC, see review [3]1 . Feasibility of the separation of pp collision into peripheral and central\nimpact parameters collisions using different triggers (two, 4 jet production at central rapidities)\nis practically important. Really collision at central impact parameters is dominated by the novel\nQCD regime (QCD environment for new particles production) which is characterized by unbroken chiral symmetry and certain remnants of conformal symmetry. This is in contrast with the\nperipheral pp collisions where hadronic states are in the phase of spontaneously broken chiral\nsymmetry and no conformal symmetry.\n1\n\nHere B is the slope of t dependence measured in the elastic pp collisions\n\n190\n\nMPI08\n\n\fIn spite of the fact that at energies of LHC the total contribution of hard processes into\n\u03c3tot (pp) is not large but both hard processes as well as heavy particle production are concentrated at central impact parameters. So QCD environment for new particles production strongly\ndepends on collision energy making difficult the separation of hadronic products of new particles\ndecays from the background from hadronic processes. This problem is especially important for\nestablishing quantum numbers of new particles.\nAnother important feature of QCD physics which makes modeling of QCD processes at\nLHC difficult is that observed increase cross sections with collision energy comes to conflict with\nprobability conservation at given impact parameter: \u03c3el (s, b) \u221d (s/so )2\u03b4 \u2264 \u03c3tot (s, b) \u221d (s/so )\u03b4 .\nThis restriction has simple interpretation: absorption of rapid particle can not exceed 100%, cf.\ndiscussion in the text. This condition restricts region of applicability of pQCD approximations\nwhich were successful at lesser energies.\nIn the new regime of strong interaction with small coupling constant pQCD is inapplicable. However regime of complete absorption where partial waves achieve maximum allowed\nby probability conservation some important properties of hard processes like total cross section,\ndisappearance of leading hadrons, jets at zero impact parameters, cross sections of diffractive\nprocesses can be evaluated legitimately. In the new QCD regime multiparton interactions are\nnot suppressed by powers of virtuality and observation of them will be most effective method\nof probing novel QCD regime. Measurement of diffractive electroproduction of vector mesons\nat HERA helped to establish gluon GPD, i.e. gluon distribution in impact parameter space [?]\nwhich is important for the analysis of new particles production.\nIn the second section we will discuss nontrivial features of impact parameter distribution.\nIn the third section we formulate restrictions which follow from probability conservation and\nfound two phase regime. In the section 4 we discuss dependence on energy of QCD environment.\nIn section 5 we consider impact of discussed above phenomena on the gap survival probability.\n2\n\nImpact parameter distribution for soft and hard interactions\n\nTo formulate probability conservation it is convenient to use impact parameter representation for\nthe scattering amplitude:\nT (s, t) = (is/4\u03c0)\n\n\ufffd\n\nexp(iqt b)\u0393(s, b)d2 b\n\n(1)\n\nOne may easily reconstruct \u0393 for the soft QCD interactions using parametrizations for elastic pp\ncollisions.\n\u0393sof t (s, b2 ) = (\u03c3tot (pp)/\u03c0)exp(\u2212b2 /2B)\n(2)\nHere B is the slope of t dependence of elastic cross section.\nThe impact parameter distribution of gluons can be reconstructed from gluon GPD measured in the hard exclusive processes like diffractive electroproduction of vector mesons \u03b3 \u2217 +p \u2192\nV + p. It is important that according to QCD factorization theorem of [4] such processes are calculable in terms of generalized parton distributions(GPD). Thus impact parameter dependence\nof gluon distribution can be reconstructed using two gluon form factor of a nucleon see review\nand references in [3] and new calculation in [5]:\nMPI08\n\n191\n\n\f\u0393gluon (x, b) = (xo /x)\u03bb (\u03bcb)K1 (\u03bcb)\n\n(3)\n\nHere K is function of Hankel of imaginary argument. Experimentally \u03bb \u2248 0.2 and increasing\nwith virtuality, \u03bc \u2248 1GeV and slowly decreasing with energy.\n\nComparison between Eq.2 and Eq.2 allows to establish important properties of QCD environment:\n\u2022 Knowledge of the slope B for the soft QCD interactions and \u03bc for hard interactions allows\nto derive novel and important property: impact parameter distribution characteristic for\nsoft processes is significantly wider than for hard processes and its radius is increasing\nwith energy.\n\u2022 According to QCD factorization theorem hard processes and new particles production are\ndominated by convolution of gluon distributions. So they have close impact parameter\ndistributions.\n\u2022 Amplitudes of hard processes are significantly smaller than that for soft ones (Bjorken\nscaling) but more rapidly increasing with energy.\n\u2022 Existence of correlations between partons suggest that multiparton interactions may be\ncharacterized by more narrow distribution in impact parameter space. [1]\n3\n\nConservation of probability and two phase picture\n\nIn a quantum theory cross sections of hadron collisions can be calculated in terms of profile\nfunction \u0393(s, b) as\n\u03c3el =\n\u03c3inel =\n\n\ufffd\n\n\u03c3tot =\n\n\ufffd\n\nd2 b\u0393(s, b)|2\n\n(4)\n\nd2 b[1 \u2212 |1 \u2212 \u0393(s, b)|2 ]\n\n(5)\n\n\ufffd\n\n(6)\n\nd2 b 2Re\u0393(s, b)\n\nAbove equations are applicable also for the scattering of spatially small dipole of a hadron\ntarget if to neglect by the increase of the number of constituents within this dipole with the\nincrease of virtuality. Evaluation of radiative corrections to the impact factors in [6] indicates\nthat these corrections seems to be small.\nIt follows from these equations that :\n\u2022 \u0393(s, b) is restricted from above by the condition: \u0393(s, b) \u2264 1 . Upper boundary \u0393(s, b) = 1\n\n(7)\n\nis equivalent to the requirement that absorption can not exceed 100%. Since amplitudes of\nsoft and hard interactions are increasing with energy see Eq.2 and Eq.2 each projectile will\nbe absorbed with 100% probability. Thus at given impact parameter \u0393 = 1 at sufficiently\nlarge energies. This condition does not includes any dependence on virtuality.\n192\n\nMPI08\n\n\f\u2022 Thus Bjorken scaling completely disappears at large energies, in the limit of fixed Q2 but\nx \u2192 0 . Numerical evaluations show that onset of this this novel QCD regime at b = 0\nrequires x \u2264 10\u22123 \u2212 10\u22124 . See review [3].\n\u2022 Another important novel effect to reveal itself at LHC : amplitudes of hard processes should\nexceed amplitudes of soft QCD processes for the scattering at zero impact parameter since\namplitudes of hard interactions are increasing with energy more rapidly than soft one.\nMoreover at given impact parameter soft interactions disappear with increase of energy for\nthe the review and references [3].\n\u2022 Two phases QCD picture emerges for high energy collisions. In the scattering at large\nimpact parameters -peripheral collisions- nonperturbative QCD interactions would dominate. Here interaction chooses familiar phase of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry\nand conformal symmetry is broken. On the contrary -for the scattering at central impact\nparameters hard interactions with unbroken chiral symmetry would dominate.\n4\n\nChange of hadron environment\n\nTo visualize dependence of hadron environment on energy we begin from the consideration of\nscattering of small dipole off a hadron target. The characteristic feature of hard processes is\nthe approximate Bjorken scaling for the structure functions of DIS, i.e. the two dimensional\nconformal invariance for the moments of the structure functions. In this approximation as well as\nwithin the leading log(x0 /x) approximation, the transverse momenta of quarks within the dipole\nproduced by the local electroweak current are restricted by the virtuality of the external field:\n\u039b2 \u2264 p2t \u2264 Q2 /4.\n\n(8)\n\nHere \u039b \u2261 \u039bQCD = 300 Mev is a QCD scale. However it follows from the QCD factorization\ntheorem proved in Refs. [7] that within this kinematical range the smaller transverse size d of\nthe configuration (the transverse distance between the constituents of the dipole) corresponds to\na more rapid increase of its interaction with the collision energy:\n\u03c3 = \u03b1s (c/d2 )F 2\n\n\u03c02 2\nd xGT (x, c/d2 ),\n4\n\n(9)\n\nhere F 2 = 4/3 or 9/4 depends whether the dipole consists of color triplet or color octet constituents, GT is an integrated gluon distribution function and c is a parameter c = 4 \u00f7 9. It is\nwell known in the DGLAP approximation that the structure function GT (x, Q2 ) increases more\nrapidly with 1/x at larger Q2 . This property agrees well with the recent HERA data. We shall\ndemonstrate using kt factorization that the transverse momenta of the (anti)quark of the q q\u0304 pair\nproduced by a local current increase with the energy and become larger than Q2 /4 at sufficiently\nlarge energies. In other words the characteristic transverse momenta in the fragmentation region\nincrease with the energy. Technically this effect follows from the more rapid increase with the\nenergy of the pQCD interaction for smaller dipole and the kt factorization theorem.\nIt is worth noting that this kinematics is very different from the central rapidity kinematics where the increase of p2t was found in the leading \u03b1s log(x0 /x) BFKL approximation:\nlog2 (p2t /p2t0 ) \u221d log(s/s0 ). Indeed, the latter rapid increase is the property of the ladder: the\nMPI08\n\n193\n\n\ffurther we go along the ladder, the larger are characteristic transverse momenta, i.e. we have a\ndiffusion in the space of transverse momenta . On the other hand the property we are dealing here\nwith is the property of a characteristic transverse momenta in the wave function of the projectile.\nThe dipole approximation provides the target rest frame description which is equivalent to\nthe Infinite Momentum Frame (IMF) description of DIS in LO DGLAP and BFKL approximations. To achieve equivalence with the IMF description in the NLO approximation it is necessary\nto calculate radiative corrections to cross section in the fragmentation region, i.e. to take into account the increase of the number of constituents and related renormalization of the dipole wave\nfunction. Recent calculations [6] suggest that these corrections are small. Consequently we will\nneglect these corrections.\nOur main result [5] is that the median transverse momenta kt2 of the leading q q\u0304 pair in the\nfragmentation region grows as\nkt2 \u223c a(Q2 )/(x/x0 )\u03bb(Q\n\n2)\n\n(10)\n\n(The median means that the configurations with the momentum/masses less than the median one\ncontribute half of the total crosssection). The exponential factors \u03bb and \u03bbM are both approximately \u223c 0.1. These factors are weakly dependent on the external virtuality Q2 . The exact\nvalues also depend on the details of the process, i.e. whether we consider the DIS process with\nlongitudinal or transverse photons, as well as on the model and approximation used. The exact\nform of \u03bb(Q2 ), and \u03bbM (Q2 ) are given below.\nThe rapid increase of the characteristic transverse scales in the fragmentation region has\nbeen found first in Refs. [3, 8\u201310], but within the black disk regime (BDR). Our new result is\nthe prediction of the increase with energy of the jet transverse momenta in the fragmentation\nregion/the rise of the transverse momenta in the impact factor with the energy, in the kinematical\ndomain where methods of pQCD are still applicable. This effect could be considered as a precursor of the black disk regime indicating the possibility of the smooth matching between two\nregimes.\nOur results can be applied to a number of processes. First we consider the deeply virtual\nCompton scattering (DVCS) process, i.e. \u03b3 + p \u2192 \u03b3 \u2217 + p.\nWe also find that at sufficiently large energies\n\n\u03c3L (x, Q2 )/\u03c3T (x, Q2 ) \u221d (Q2 /4p2t ) \u221d (1/x)\u03bb .\n\n(11)\n\nHence the \u03c3L /\u03c3T ratio should decrease as the power of energy instead of being O(\u03b1s ).\nOur results have an implication for the space structure of the wave packet describing a\nrapid hadron. In the classical multiperipheral picture of Gribov a hadron has a shape of a pancake\nof the longitudinal size 1/\u03bc (where \u03bc is the scale of soft QCD) which does not depend on the\nincident energy [11]. On the contrary, QCD predicts [5] the biconcave shape for the rapid hadron\nin pQCD with the minimal longitudinal length (that corresponds to small impact parameter b)\ndecreasing with increase of energy and being smaller for nuclei than for the nucleons.\n\n194\n\nMPI08\n\n\f5\n\nGap survival probability\n\nEvaluation of a number of a number processes with large rapidity gap like p + p \u2192 p + H +\np, p + p \u2192 p + 2jet + p etc requires evaluation of survival factor S 2 . It has been shown in [?]\nthat screening effects related to nonperturbative QCD can be evaluated relyably on the basis of\nnew QCD factorization theorem.\nS2 =\n\n\ufffd\n\nd2 bPhard |1 \u2212 \u0393(b)|2\n\n(12)\n\nHere Phard is impact parameter distribution of hard processes calculable in terms of two gluon\nform factor of a nucleon. There is no need to model multi Pomeron exchanges by applying\neikonal approximation which has in QCD problems with account of energy-momentum conservation.\nMore tricky is evaluation of screening factor because of small x hard QCD phenomena\n-this job is in progress.\nI am indebted to my coathors M.Strikman and B.Blok for the illuminating discussions of\nthe phenomena considered in the paper.\nReferences\n[1] B.Sostrand.

These data\nallow to study rescattering and gap survival probability in ep interactions.\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe role of rescattering and gap survival probability in ep interactions at HERA has been studied\nby the H1 and ZEUS Collaborations looking at diffractive dijet photoproduction and leading\nneutron production.\nDiffractive ep events, ep \u2192 eXp, are characterized by the presence in the final state\nof a fast forward proton, scattered at a very small angle having lost only a small fraction of\nthe incoming proton energy, and a large rapidity gap (LRG) with no particle flow between the\nscattered proton and the hadronic system X from the dissociated photon. This event topology is\nascribed to the absence of colour flow between the proton and the system X, due to the exchange\nof an object with vacuum quantum numbers, historically called pomeron. Both characteristics\nhave been used at HERA to select diffractive events, either by measuring the fast scattered proton\nwith detectors placed along the proton beamline at distances between 20 and 90 m from the\ninteraction point, or by searching for LRG in the central detectors. The diffractive samples for\nthe dijet photoproduction analyses presented here were selected by both Collaborations using the\nLRG method.\nLeading neutron events, ep \u2192 eXn, are characterized by the presence in the final state\nof a fast forward neutron carrying a relevant fraction of the incoming proton beam energy. This\nneutron escapes along the beamline and is detected by both Collaborations by means of forward\nneutron calorimeters placed at about 100 m from the interaction point.\n2\n\nQCD factorization in diffraction\n\nAccording to the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) factorization theorem [1], the cross section\nfor diffractive processes in deep inelastic scattering (DIS) can be expressed as a convolution of\npartonic hard scattering cross sections, which are calculable in perturbative QCD (pQCD), and\nuniversal diffractive parton density functions (DPDFs) of the proton, which are analogous to the\nusual proton PDFs under the condition that the proton stays intact in the interaction.\nAt HERA, various sets of DPDFs [2] have been determined from QCD fits to inclusive\ndiffractive cross section measurements in DIS. It was found that most of the momentum of the\ndiffractive exchange is carried by gluons.\nThe DPDFs extracted from inclusive data have been used for calculating next-to-leading\norder (NLO) predictions of semi-inclusive DIS diffractive final states, in particular dijet and open\n196\n\nMPI08\n\n\fe\n\ne\n\n\u03b3 (\u2217)\n\nRemnant\n\n\u03b3 (\u2217)\n\nJet\n\nx\u03b3\n\nJet\n\nzIP\n\nIP\np\n\nRemnant\nY\n\nxIP\np\n\n(u)\n\nJet\nJet\n\n}M\n\n12\n\nX\n\n(v)\n\nRemnant\nY\n\nFig. 1: Left panel: Direct-photon diagram for diffractive dijet photoproduction.

Both H1 and ZEUS data on the DIS diffractive production of open\ncharm [3] and dijets [4, 5] agree with NLO predictions within the uncertainties, which represents\nan experimental proof of the validity of QCD factorization in diffractive DIS. This also allowed\nto include dijet data in the QCD fits to better constrain the DPDFs, in particular the gluon one [5].\nQCD factorization is not expected to hold in diffractive hadron-hadron interactions. Actually, QCD calculations with HERA DPDFs as input overestimate the cross section for single\ndiffractive dijet production in pp\u0304 collisions at the Tevatron by approximately a factor 10 [6].\nThis violation of factorization has been understood in terms of secondary interactions and rescattering between spectator partons, which may fill the rapidity gap, leading to a breakdown of\nhard-scattering factorization and causing a suppression of the diffractive cross section. Models\nincluding rescattering corrections via multi-pomeron exchanges are able to describe the suppression observed [7], which is often quantified by a 'rapidity gap survival probability'. This is also\nof great interest for the forthcoming LHC data analyses.\nThe increasing role of rescattering in the transition from DIS to hadron-hadron interactions\ncan be studied at HERA by comparing processes in DIS and in photoproduction (PHP), since in\nphotoproduction the quasi-real photon, with virtuality Q2 \u223c 0, can develop a hadronic structure.\n\nAt leading order (LO) two types of processes contribute to PHP events (see Fig. 1), directand resolved-photon processes. When the photon participates directly in the hard scattering as\na point-like probe the processes are expected to be similar to the DIS ones and diffractive QCD\nfactorization is expected to hold as in DIS. In contrast, processes in which the photon is first\nresolved into partons which then engage in the hard scattering resemble hadron-hadron interactions. In this latter case, the additional photon remnant opens up the possibility of secondary\nremnant-remnant interactions and diffractive QCD factorization is not expected to hold.\n\nMPI08\n\n197\n\n\fH1 Diffractive Dijet Photoproduction\n\njets\nd\u03c3/dzIP\n(pb)\n\n500\n\na)\n\nH1\n\n400\n\nd\u03c3/dx\u03b3jets (pb)\n\nH1 2006 Fit B DPDF\nFR NLO\u00d7(1+\u03b4had) \u00d70.5\nFR NLO \u00d70.5\n\nH1 Data\ncorrelated\nuncertainty\n\n300\n\n600\n\nb)\n\nH1\n400\n\n200\n200\n\n100\n\nNLO\u00d70.5\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nNLO\u00d70.5\n\n0.8\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n800\n700\n\nc)\n\nH1\n\n600\n500\n400\n300\n\nx\u03b3jets\n\nd\u03c3/dW (pb GeV-1)\n\nd\u03c3/dlog10(xIP) (pb)\n\njets\nzIP\n\n6\n5\n\nH1\n\nd)\n\n4\n3\n2\n\n200\n100\n0\n-2.3\n\n1\n\nNLO\u00d70.5\n-2.1\n\n-1.9\n\n-1.7\n\n-1.5\n\nlog10(xIP)\n\n0\n\nNLO\u00d70.5\n180\n\n200\n\n220\n\n240\n\nW (GeV)\n\nFig. 2: Differential cross sections for the diffractive photoproduction of dijets. H1 data are compared to NLO calculations by Frixione et al.\n\n3\n\nDiffractive dijets in photoproduction: gap survival probability and its ET dependence\n\nDiffractive photoproduction of dijets has been studied by the H1 and ZEUS Collaborations as\nan interesting process to test the QCD factorization hypothesis and measure a possible rapidity\ngap survival probability in ep interactions. A reasonably high transverse energy, ET , of the\njets provides the hard scale, ensuring the applicability of pQCD at the small photon virtualities\nconsidered. The variable x\u03b3 , which is the fraction of the photon momentum entering in the hard\nscattering, is used to separate direct- and resolved-photon events, where the latter have x\u03b3 < 1.\nA first sample of H1 diffractive data [8] has been analyzed in the kinematic region Q2 <\n0.01 GeV2 , xIP < 0.03, where xIP is the fraction of the proton momentum carried by the\npomeron, ETjet1 > 5 GeV and ETjet2 > 4 GeV. Since the data were selected with the LRG\nmethod, where the diffractive proton is not measured, the sample includes events in which the\nproton dissociates into low mass states, up to MY < 1.6 GeV, that escape detection going into\nthe beampipe. Figure 2 shows a few differential distributions measured with this sample. The\nH1 data, corrected to the hadron level, are compared with NLO calculations obtained assuming\nfactorization with a program by Frixione et al. [9]. H1 2006 Fit B DPDFs have been used as\ninput and one can see that the NLO predictions, also corrected to the hadron level, agree with\nthe data if scaled by a factor 0.5. Two conclusions can be drawn: NLO calculations overestimate\nthe measured cross sections by a factor \u223c2 both in the direct and in the resolved region, in contrast to the expectation the only resolved-photon processes should be suppressed; as expected the\nsuppression in ep events is much smaller than in pp\u0304 interactions.\n198\n\nMPI08\n\n\fFig. 3: Left panel: a) Differential cross section in x\u03b3 for the diffractive photoproduction of dijets; b) ratio of data to\nNLO prediction. ZEUS data are compared to NLO calculations by Klasen and Kramer. Right panel: Cross section\ndouble ratio of H1 data to NLO predictions for PHP and DIS as function of x\u03b3 .\n\nIn Fig. 3, left panel, the ZEUS measurement [10] of the differential cross section in x\u03b3 and\nthe ratio of data to NLO calculation are shown. NLO predictions have been obtained assuming\nfactorization with a program by Klasen and Kramer [11]. The ZEUS data were selected in the\nkinematic region Q2 < 1 GeV2 , xIP < 0.025, ETjet1 > 7.5 GeV and ETjet2 > 6.5 GeV. Cross\nsections were corrected to the hadron level and the contribution due to proton dissociative events\n(16 \u00b1 4%) was subtracted. A correction for the proton dissociative contribution was also applied\nwhen using the H1 DPDFs, since these are extracted from inclusive diffractive samples including\nproton dissociation with MY < 1.6 GeV. As in the H1 analysis presented above, data do not show\nany difference between the resolved and the direct photon region. However, the ZEUS data show\na very weak, if any, suppression, which mainly originates from the lower ETjet1 region. NLO\ncalculations tend to overestimate the measured cross sections but within the large theoretical\nuncertainties the data are still compatible with QCD factorization.\nThe discrepancy between H1 and ZEUS has been attributed to the different ET regions\nof the two analyses. Indeed, both H1 and ZEUS data have a harder ET distribution than in\nNLO. The possible ET dependence of the suppression can be better seen in the double ratio\nshown in Fig. 3, right panel, obtained by dividing the ratio of measured to predicted cross section\nin photoproduction by the corresponding ratio in DIS. In this double ratio many experimental\nerrors and also theoretical scale errors cancel to a large extend. The plot gives a clear signal that\nthe rapidity gap survival probability might increase with ET .\nMPI08\n\n199\n\n\fH1 PRELIMINARY\nH1 HERA\n99-00 e+ Data\n\nNLO-FR \u00d7 (1+\u03b4\n\ncorrelated\nuncertainty\n\n)\n\nH1 2006 Fit B DPDF\nNLO-FR \u00d7 (1+\u03b4\n\ncorrelated\nuncertainty\n\nhadr.\n\nNLO-KK \u00d7 (1+\u03b4\n\n)\n\n600\n\n400\n\njet1\n\nET\n\n150\n\n)\n\nhadr.\n\nNLO-KK \u00d7 (1+\u03b4\n\nhadr.\n\nd\u03c3/dx \u03b3 (pb)\n\nd\u03c3/dx \u03b3 (pb)\n\nH1 PRELIMINARY\nH1 HERA\n99-00 e+ Data\n\nH1 2006 Fit B DPDF\n\n)\n\nhadr.\n\n> 7.5 GeV\n\njet2\n\nET\n\n> 6.5 GeV\n\nNLO \u00d7 0.61\n100\n\n200\n\njet1\n\nET > 5 GeV\njet2\n\nET\n\n50\n\n> 4 GeV\n\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n\n1\n\nx\u03b3\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1\n\nx\u03b3\n\nH1 PRELIMINARY\n\nH1 PRELIMINARY\n\nH1 HERA 99-00 e+ Data / NLO-FR \u00d7 (1+\u03b4hadr.)\n\nH1 HERA 99-00 e+ Data / NLO-FR \u00d7 (1+\u03b4hadr.)\n\nH1 2006 Fit A\n\nH1 2006 Fit B\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nH1 2006 Fit A\n\nH1 2006 Fit B\n\nH1 2007 Fit Jets\n\n(Data / Theory)\n\n(Data / Theory)\n\n1\n\n1+\u03b4hadr.\n\n1+\u03b4hadr.\n\nNLO \u00d7 0.53\n\n1\n\nx\u03b3\n\nH1 2007 Fit Jets\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nx\u03b3\n\nFig. 4: Differential cross section in x\u03b3 for the diffractive photoproduction of dijets and ratio of H1 data to NLO\npredictions. Left panel: 'Low ET ' sample. Right panel: 'High ET ' sample.\n\nTo better study the ET dependence, a more recent H1 analysis [12] has been performed,\nbased on a three times higher integrated luminosity with respect to the previous one. This allowed\nselecting two samples with different ET cuts: for the first sample (Low ET one) all the cuts were\nthe same as in the previous H1 analysis, in particular ETjet1 > 5 GeV and ETjet2 > 4 GeV, to be\nable to cross check the results; instead, the second sample (High ET one) covered a kinematical\nregion similar to that of the ZEUS analysis, with ETjet1 > 7.5 GeV and ETjet2 > 6.5 GeV. Two\nindependent NLO calculations have been compared to the measurements, that by Frixione et al.\nand that by Klasen and Kramer, using three sets of DPDFs, H1 2006 Fit A and Fit B and H1 2007\nFit Jets. Figure 4, left panel, shows the x\u03b3 distribution and the ratio of data to theory expectation\nfor the 'Low ET ' sample, while Fig. 4, right panel, shows the same plots for the 'High ET '\nsample.\nIn both cases, data confirm that there is no sign of a dependence in x\u03b3 of the rapidity gap\nsurvival probability, as already observed in the previous H1 and ZEUS analyses. The survival\nprobabilities measured with the 'Low ET ' sample are in the range 0.43-0.65, depending on the\nDPDFs but always compatible within uncertainties, and also compatible with the one of the\nprevious H1 analysis. The survival probabilities measured with the 'High ET ' sample are in the\nrange 0.44-0.79, that is slightly higher than in the 'Low ET ' case and closer to the ZEUS results,\nconfirming a possible ET dependence of the suppression.\n200\n\nMPI08\n\n\fH1 data have also been compared to NLO calculations assuming factorization breaking\nand suppression of the resolved component only. The result is a much worse agreement in the\nx\u03b3 distribution. Awaiting for more theoretical work, the experimental data seem to prefer an\nunexpected global suppression.\n4\n\nLeading neutron production: rescattering and absorption\n\nThe measurement of leading neutron (LN) production at HERA is particularly interesting for\nstudying rescattering effects in ep collisions. Although the production mechanism of leading\nneutrons is not completely understood, exchange models give a reasonable description of the\ndata. In this picture, the incoming proton emits a virtual particle which scatters on the photon\nemitted from the beam electron. In particular, one-pion exchange is a significant contributor to\nLN production for large values of xL [13], where xL is the fraction of the beam proton energy carried by the leading neutron. In exchange models, neutron absorption can occur through\nrescattering [15-18], which can thus be studied measuring neutron yields and distributions.\nFigure 5, left panel, shows the measurement with the ZEUS data [14] of the ratio of the\nnormalized cross section for LN photoproduction as a function of xL to the same distribution\nin DIS. The ratio is below 1 at low xL values and rises with increasing xL . As shown by the\ncomparison with the theoretical curves, data are consistent with a \u03c0-exchange model by D'Alesio\nand Pirner, which includes absorption via a geometrical picture [16]. In this picture, if the size\nof the n \u2212 \u03c0 system is small compared to the size of the photon, besides the \u03c0 also the neutron\ncan scatter on the photon, escaping then detection, which can be seen as neutron absorption.\nSince the size of the virtual photon is inversely related to Q2 , more absorption is expected in\nphotoproduction than in DIS. Moreover, since parametrizations of the pion flux in general show\nthat the mean value of the n \u2212 \u03c0 separation increases with xL , less absorption is expected at high\nxL than at low xL . Both behaviours are confirmed by the data. Figure 5 also shows that the data\nare reasonably consistent with a Regge-based model with multi-pomeron exchanges [15].\nThe presence of a forward neutron tracker, a scintillator hodoscope installed in the calorimeter at a depth of one interaction length, allowed the measurement of neutron transverse momenta\nin the range pT \u2264 0.69 xL GeV. The p2T distributions in the different xL bins are all compatible\nwith a single exponential distribution. In Fig. 5a, right panel, is shown the measurement of the\nexponential slopes b in DIS, while in Fig. 5b is presented the difference of the exponential slopes\nfor photoproduction and DIS. Data are compared to a \u03c0-exchange model with enhanced neutron\nabsorption based on multi-pomeron exchanges, which also accounts for the migration of neutrons in (xL , p2T ) after rescattering [18]. Including secondary exchanges (\u03c1, a2 ) allows the model\nto give a good description of the b slopes. Finally, since the size of the n \u2212 \u03c0 system is inversely\nproportional to the neutron pT , rescattering removes neutrons with large pT . Thus rescattering\nresults in a depletion of high pT neutrons in photoproduction relative to DIS.\nA possible suppression has also been looked for by H1 in a sample of photoproduction dijet\nevents with a leading neutron [19]. Jets were selected with transverse energies ETjet1 > 7 GeV\nand ETjet2 > 6 GeV. No suppression has been observed since NLO calculations by Klasen and\nKramer [20], which assume factorization, agree with the data if corrections to the hadron level\nare introduced.

Rapidity gap survival probabilities have been measured in the range 0.4-0.9, higher than in pp\u0304. Both\nH1 and ZEUS data, in contrast to the expectation, prefer a global suppression for direct and\nresolved components of the photon, with a possible ET dependence of the suppression factor.\nLeading neutron data show the effects of rescattering through the neutron absorption observed at low xL and high pT in photoproduction with respect to DIS. \u03c0-exchange models with\nenhanced absorptive corrections, including migration and secondary exchanges, are able to describe the data. Absorptive effects may equally be described in terms of gap survival probability.\nIt is worth to note that the HERA data can be used to get reliable predictions for the gap survival\nprobability in pp interactions [22], which is a crucial input to calculations of diffractive processes\nat the LHC.\nReferences\n[1] J.C.

Studies\nare presented of single-diffractive di-jet production in pp collisions at\n\u221a\ns = 14 TeV, single-diffractive W boson production, and exclusive Y\nphotoproduction. The prospects of assessing the rapidity-gap survival\nprobability are discussed.\n1 Introduction\nA substantial fraction of the total proton-proton cross section is due to diffractive reactions of the\ntype pp \u2192 XY , where X, Y are either protons or low-mass states which may be a resonance\nor a continuum state. In all cases, the energy of the outgoing protons or the states X, Y is\napproximately equal to that of the incoming beam particles, to within a few per cent. The two\n(groups of) final-state particles are well separated in phase space and have a large gap in rapidity\nbetween them (\"large rapidity gap\", LRG). Diffractive hadron-hadron scattering can be described\nwithin Regge theory (see e.g. [1]). In this framework, diffraction is characterised by the exchange\nof a specific trajectory, the \"Pomeron\", which has the quantum numbers of the vacuum and\nnotably no colour (hence the LRG).\nThe effort to understand diffraction in QCD has received a great boost from the seminal\nstudies of diffractive pp\u0304 collisions with the UA8 experiment at CERN [2] and more recently from\nstudies of diffractive events in ep collisions at HERA and pp\u0304 collisions at Fermilab (see e.g. [3\u20139]\nand references therein). A key to this success are factorisation theorems for ep diffractive scattering, which allow to express the cross section in terms of diffractive parton distribution functions\nand generalised parton distributions. These functions can be extracted from measurements and\ncontain information about small-x partons that can only be obtained in diffractive processes.\nTo describe hard diffractive hadron-hadron collisions is more challenging since factorisation is\nbroken by rescattering between spectator partons. These rescattering effects, often quantified in\nterms of the so-called \"rapidity-gap survival probability\" [10, 11], are of interest in their own\nright because of their relation with multiple parton scattering.\nThis paper summarises some recent feasibility studies carried out by the CMS Collaboration, aiming at \"rediscovering\" hard-diffraction with the early LHC data and at quantifying the\nrapidity-gap survival probability at LHC energies by means of the single-diffractive (SD) reaction\npp \u2192 Xp, in which X includes either a W boson or a di-jet system. This reaction is sensitive\n\u2020\n\n204\n\nspeaker\n\nMPI08\n\n\fto the diffractive structure function (dPDF) of the proton, specifically its gluon component (see\ne.g. [3]). It is also sensitive to the rapidity-gap survival probability, \ufffd|S 2 |\ufffd; to first approximation,\nthe cross section is directly proportional to \ufffd|S 2 |\ufffd, independent of kinematics. This process has\nbeen studied at the Tevatron, where the ratio of the yields for SD and inclusive di-jet production\nhas been measured to be approximately 1% [8, 12, 13]. Theoretical expectations for LHC are\nat the level of a fraction of a per cent [11, 14\u201318]. There are, however, significant uncertainties\nin the predictions, notably due to the uncertainty of \ufffd|S 2 |\ufffd. While there is some consensus that\n\ufffd|S 2 |\ufffd \ufffd 0.05 [16, 17] for hard diffractive processes at LHC energies, values of \ufffd|S 2 |\ufffd as low\nas 0.004 and as high as 0.23 have been proposed [18]. Exclusive photoproduction of \u03a5 mesons,\npp \u2192 p\u03a5p is also briefly discussed. This reaction is sensitive to the structure of the proton, notably the generalised (or skewed) gluon density, but the rapidity-gap survival probability should\nin this case be close to unity [19].\nThe CMS apparatus is described in detail elsewhere [20]. Two experimental scenarios\nare considered here. In the first, no forward detectors beyond the CMS forward calorimeter HF\nare assumed. In this case the pseudo-rapidity coverage is limited to |\u03b7| < 5. In the second,\nadditional coverage at \u22126.6 < \u03b7 < \u22125.2 is assumed by means of the CASTOR calorimeter. HF\nand CASTOR are briefly discussed in the next section.\nFor more details on the analyses presented here, the reader is referred to [21\u201323].\n2 The HF and CASTOR calorimeters\nThe forward part of the hadron calorimeter, HF, is located 11.2 m from the interaction point.\nIt consists of steel absorbers and embedded radiation hard quartz fibers, which provide a fast\ncollection of Cherenkov light. Each HF module is constructed of 18 wedges in a nonprojective\ngeometry with the quartz fibers running parallel to the beam axis along the length of the iron\nabsorbers. Long (1.65 m) and short (1.43 m) quartz fibers are placed alternately with a separation\nof 5 mm. These fibers are bundled at the back of the detector and are read out separately with\nphototubes.\nCASTOR is a sampling calorimeter located at \ufffd 14 m from the interaction point, with\ntungsten plates as absorbers and fused silica quartz plates as active medium. The plates are\ninclined by 45\u25e6 with respect to the beam axis. The calorimeter has the shape of an octagonal\ncylinder. Particles passing through the quartz emit Cherenkov photons which are transmitted\nto photomultiplier tubes through air-core light-guides. The electromagnetic section is 22 radiation length deep with 2 tungsten-quartz sandwiches, and the hadronic section consists of 12\ntungsten-quartz sandwiches. The total depth is 10.3 interaction lengths. The calorimeter readout has azimuthal and longitudinal segmentation (16 and 14 segments, respectively). There is no\nsegmentation in \u03b7.\n3 SD W and di-jet production\nThe analyses described here are planned for the first LHC data, and can be carried out on data\nsamples with integrated luminosities of 10-100 pb\u22121 and with negligible pile-up. A centre-ofmass energy of 14 TeV is used. No near-beam proton tagger is assumed, and the selection of\ndiffractive events has therefore to rely on the observation of a rapidity gap.\nMPI08\n\n205\n\n\fThe single diffractive signals were simulated with the POMWIG Monte Carlo generator [14]. Non-diffractive events were simulated with PYTHIA [24] or MADGRAPH [25].\n3.1 Event selection\n3.1.1 W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd production\n\nThe selection of the events with a candidate W decaying to \u03bc\u03bd is the same as that used for\ninclusive W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd production [26]. Events with a candidate muon in the pseudo-rapidity range\n|\u03b7| > 2.0 and transverse momentum pT < 25 GeV were rejected, as were events with at least\n\ufffd\ntwo muons with pT > 20 GeV. Muon isolation was imposed by requiring pT < 3 GeV in a\ncone with \u2206R < 0.3. The transverse mass was required to be MT > 50 GeV. The contribution\nfrom top events containing muons was reduced by rejecting events with more than 3 jets with\nET > 40 GeV (selected with a cone algorithm with radius of 0.5) and events with acoplanarity\n(\u03b6 = \u03c0 \u2212 \u2206\u03c6) between the muon and the direction associated to ETmiss greater than 1 rad.\n3.1.2 Di-jet production\nAt the trigger level, events were selected by requiring at least 2 jets with average uncorrected\ntransverse energy greater then 30 GeV. Offline, jets were reconstructed with the SiSCone5 [27] algorithm and jet-energy scale (JES) corrections were applied. At least two jets with ET > 55 GeV\nwere required. All plots shown in this paper are for energy-corrected jets.\n3.1.3 Diffractive selection\nThe left panel of Fig. 1 shows the generated energy-weighted \u03b7 distribution for stable particles\nin single-diffractive and non-diffractive W production events; only diffractive events with the\nscattered proton at positive rapidities (the peak at \u03b7 >\n\u223c10) are included in the plot. Diffractive\nevents have, on average, lower multiplicity both in the central region and in the hemisphere that\ncontains the scattered proton, the so-called \"gap side\", than non-diffractive events. The right\npanel of Fig. 1 shows the multiplicity distribution in the central tracker for |\u03b7| < 2 after the di-jet\nselection cuts. Diffractive events have a multiplicity distribution that peaks at low values, unlike\nthat of non-diffractive events. Diffractive event candidates were therefore selected on the basis\nof the multiplicity distribution in the central tracker, in the HF as well as in CASTOR.\nThe gap side was selected as that with lower energy sum in the HF. This selection was\nmade for all events though the concept is relevant only for diffractive events.\nIn addition, for the di-jet analysis, the two leading jets were required to be between \u22124 <\n\u03b7 < 1 for events with the gap side at positive rapidities and \u22121 < \u03b7 < 4 for events with the\ngap side at negative rapidities. When CASTOR is used, only events with the gap on the negative\nside are considered, since CASTOR will be installed on that side first. The rapidity separation\nbetween the two leading jets was required to be \u2206\u03b7 < 3.\nFinally, a cut was applied on the track multiplicity in the central tracker. The plots shown\nmax , of 1, 5 and no cut at\nin this paper were obtained with maximum multiplicity for |\u03b7| < 2, Ntrack\nall. For the events passing this cut, multiplicity distributions in the HF and CASTOR calorimeters\nwere studied, from which a diffractive sample can be extracted.\n206\n\nMPI08\n\n\fDensity\n\nDensity\n\n10-1\n\nCMS preliminary\n\n10-1\n\nPOMWIG SD W\u2192\u03bc\u03bd\nPYTHIA Inclusive W\u2192\u03bc\u03bd\n\n10-2\nHF\n\nCASTOR\n\n10-2\n\n10-3\n\n10-3\n\n|\u03b7| < 2.0\npT > 0.9 GeV\n\n10-4\n\nPOMWIG SD W\u2192\u03bc\u03bd\nPYTHIA Inclusive W\u2192\u03bc\u03bd\n\n10-4\n-15\n\nCMS preliminary\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10-5\n10\n\n15\n\n\u03b7 generated particles\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\ntrack multiplicity\n\nFig. 1: Left panel: Generated energy-weighted \u03b7 distribution for stable particles (excluding neutrinos) in diffractive\n(POMWIG, continuous line) and non-diffractive ( PYTHIA, dashed line) W production events.

In the figure, the top left and top right plots show the distributions expected for the\ndiffractive W events with generated gap in the positive and negative Z direction, respectively1 ;\nthey exhibit a clear peak at zero multiplicity. Conversely, the non-diffractive W events have on\naverage higher multiplicities, as shown in the bottom left plot; this distribution is interesting in\nits own right as it is sensitive to the underlying event in non-diffractive interactions. Finally, the\nbottom right plot shows the sum of the POMWIG and PYTHIA distributions \u2013 this is the type of\ndistribution expected from the data. The diffractive signal at low multiplicities is visible. The\nsignificance is highest when the Ntrack cut is most strict (see [21]).\nThe HF tower multiplicity vs CASTOR \u03c6 sector multiplicity was also studied for the gap\nside. Since CASTOR will be installed at first on the negative side of the interaction point, only\nevents with the gap on that side (as determined with the procedure discussed above) were considered. The CMS software chain available for this study did not include simulation/reconstruction\ncode for CASTOR; therefore, the multiplicity of generated hadrons with energy above a 10 GeV\nthreshold in each of the CASTOR azimuthal sectors was used. Figure 3 shows plots analogous\nto those of Fig. 2 for the combination of HF and CASTOR. The top plots show the POMWIG distributions; the few events in the top left plot are those for which the gap-side determination was\nincorrect. The signal to background ratio improves greatly with respect to the HF only case since\n1\n\nThe Z axis is along the beam direction.\n\nMPI08\n\n207\n\n\fPOMWIG SD W\u2192\u03bc\u03bd (gap in \u03b7-minus side)\nN events (100 pb )\n\n-1\n\nN events (100 pb-1)\n\nPOMWIG SD W\u2192\u03bc\u03bd (gap in \u03b7-plus side)\n200\n180\n160\n140\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n10\n\nn H9 8\nF\" 7 6\nforw 5\nard 4 3\nslic 2 1\ne\" 0 0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nn\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nnH\n\n8\n\nF\" 7 6\nforw 5\nard 4 3\nslic 2 1\ne\" 0 0\n\n10\n\n\u03b7 slice\"\nHF \"low\n6\n\n180\n160\n140\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n10 9\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nCMS preliminary\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0\n10\n\nn H9 8\nF\" 7 6\nforw 5\nard4 3\nslic 2 1\ne\" 0 0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nw\u03b7\nn HF \"lo\n\n9 10\n\nslice\"\n\n8\n\n7\n\n9 10\n\nw \u03b7 slice\"\n\nn tracks \u2264 5\n\nPOMWIG + PYTHIA\nN events (100 pb-1)\n\nN events (100 pb-1)\n\nPYTHIA Inclusive W\u2192\u03bc\u03bd\n\n6\n\nn HF \"lo\n\n900\n800\n700\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0\n10 9\n\nnH 8\nF\" 7 6\nforw 5\nard4 3\nslic 2 1\ne\" 0 0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9 10\n\ne\"\n\nw \u03b7 slic\n\nn HF \"lo\n\nFig. 2: Low-\u03b7 (\"central slice\") vs high-\u03b7 (\"forward slice\") HF tower multiplicity distributions for events with track\nmultiplicity in the central tracker Ntrack \u2264 5.

Plots of this type, along with others presented\nin [22], can be used to demonstrate the existence of a SD di-jet signal in a data-driven, modelindependent way.\nOnce the existence of the signal is established, here again, a sample of diffractive events\ncan be obtained by using the zero-multiplicity bins, where the diffractive events cluster and the\nnon-diffractive background is small. For example, when an integrated effective luminosity for\nsingle interactions of 10 pb\u22121 becomes available, SD di-jet production can then be observed with\nO(300) signal events.\n4.2.1 Sensitivity to the value of the rapidity-gap survival probability\nTable 1 gives the expected SD di-jet signal and background yields in the zero-multiplicity bins\nalso for values of the rapidity-gap survival probability \ufffd|S|2 \ufffd = 0.004 and \ufffd|S|2 \ufffd = 0.23. In the\nformer case, the observable signal becomes marginal, even with the widest possible \u03b7 coverage\n(HF+CASTOR). Conversely, \ufffd|S|2 \ufffd = 0.23 gives rise to a very prominent signal, also in the\nHF-only case.\nIn order to assess the significance of these yields, a preliminary, conservative estimate of\nthe systematic uncertainties was obtained by summing in quadrature the contributions due to\nthe sensitivity to the HF threshold (\u00b115%), the jet-energy scale (\u00b130%), the use of different jet\nalgorithms (\u00b120%) and a +30% contribution due to proton dissociation (see [22]), yielding a\nMPI08\n\n209\n\n\fFig. 4: HF-only (top row) and HF vs CASTOR (bottom row) multiplicity distributions for signal plus background\nmax\nevents with no cut on the track multiplicity in the central tracker (left column), Ntrack\n= 5 (central column) and\nmax\nNtrack\n= 1 (right column).\n\n+50\n\u221240 %\n\nsystematic uncertainty.\n\nmax\nObservation of an event yield of 236 \u00b1 15(stat.)+120\n\u221290 (syst.)

This reaction has\nbeen studied at HERA, and can be investigated at CMS with the early LHC data [23]. A few\nhundred events events are expected in 100 pb\u22121 . This process is interesting in its own right as a\nwindow on the generalised parton distribution functions of the proton. In addition, the rapiditygap survival probability in this case is expected to be close to unity [19]. The yield of exclusive \u03a5\nphotoproduction should thus be essentially unsuppressed \u2013 and can be used to further constrain\nthe understanding of the rapidity-gap survival probability.\n6 A look at the future: near-beam proton taggers\nCMS (and ATLAS [28]) will be able to carry out a forward and diffractive physics program also\nat the highest LHC instantaneous luminosities if the FP420 program [29] is approved.

Most of the cross section at the LHC will\ninvolve production of particles in the forward direction, and the large\nrapidity coverage of Atlas allows the study of several interesting QCD\nchannels, both in the framework of diffraction and for studies of underlying event and QCD evolution.\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.1\n\nForward physics at the LHC\n\nThe first LHC data will mainly be used for commissioning and calibration, but even with small\nluminosity a large number of events with forward jets will be recorded. The LHC detectors aim\nat covering values of rapidity up to 5, much larger than CDF and D0, allow to say something\nnew about forward physics. Still, most of the particles are produced in the rapidity regions above\n5, so far uninstrumented. A vast program [1] is however under way to extend the coverage of\nboth ATLAS and CMS detectors to rapidities of 10 or more, using the LHC dipoles as giant\nspectrometers to measure protons that remain intact after a diffractive interaction.\n1.2\n\nForward jet production\n\nMost of the LHC interactions will involve forward jets final states. In most of QCD events,\njets are produced by fragmentation of coloured quarks and gluons, and also coloured objects are\nproduced between the jets. So, in events with forward-backward jets, quite a strong hadronic\nactivity is present in the forward region.\nIn some cases, final-state jets are produced through the exchange of colourless particles, like vector bosons, or gluons combining to form a colour-singlet state (often referred as\na pomeron, or odderon depending on its parity quantum numbers). Exchange of colourless objects has a much smaller cross section than the exchange of coloured ones, but their characteristic\nsignature is the presence of a rapidity gap, i.e. a zone of the detector with very little or absent\nhadronic activity. Not all events produced by the exchange of colour singlets will have a rapidity\ngap: initial and final state radiation will destroy the gap in the majority of the cases, and in the\nliterature we usually define the gap survival fraction as the probability that a colour-singlet event\nwill have a real rapidity gap. The interesting point is that this fraction is independent of the gap\nsize, while for events with exchange of coloured objects, the presence of rapidity gaps is suppressed exponentially as a function of the gap size. Looking for large rapidity intervals between\njets increases the likelihood of finding events with large gaps, hence the interest in looking for\nevents with very forward and very backward jets.\n\u2020\n\nOn behalf of the Atlas collaboration\n\nMPI08\n\n213\n\n\fFig. 1: A Feynman diagram showing a gluon ladder\n\n1.3\n\nQCD evolution\n\nIn most of the QCD calculations, the evolution from the hard scattering, usually calculated using a\nmatrix element, and the soft scale, is done using the DGLAP [2] equation, where gluon splittings\nare ordered in kT and x, and sums on ln(Q2 ). The BFKL equation [3] performs ordering in x\n(and random walk in kT ) and resummation in ln1/x, therefore it is more suitable to describe\nlow-x processes like forward-backward jets.\nThe resulting description is often depicted as a gluon ladder connecting quarks from the\ninitial proton (see figure 1. When no gluon lines are emitted from the ladder, the gluon ladder\nbehaves as a colour singlet, and these events will have a rapidity gap in the final state, i.e. a\nregion of the detector with very little or absent hadronic activity.\n2\n\nPrevious measurements on hard colour singlet\n\nEvents with two jets separated by rapidity gaps have already been measured at the Tevatron and at\nHERA, where events with pure colour singlet exchange (without initial- or final-state radiation)\nwere measured to be about 1% of the total hadronic interactions. In particular a paper from D0 [4]\nstudied the evolution of the fraction of events with a rapidity gap as a function of the \u2206\u03b7 between\nthe two jets, up to a rapidity interval of 6, getting higher results to what expected from Herwig,\nthat also incorporates the BFKL approach. It was suggested [5] that having a fixed value of \u03b1S\n(as opposed to a running one) at the vertex between the pomeron and the quark does a better job\nin fitting the data, but more data are needed to solve this issue.\n\n214\n\nMPI08\n\n\f3\n\nFirst predictions for the LHC\n\nThe extrapolation of the Tevatron measurements to the LHC energies is not obvious, but most of\nthe present models foresee an increase of the survival factor (the probability that a rapidity gap\nevent remains intact also after initial- and final-state radiation) at LHC energies. This increase\nis expected to be even larger for large gaps, and cross sections are such that a few pb\u22121 of data\nwill be sufficient to have a measurement of the survival factor at the percent level, at least for\nvalues of |\u2206\u03b7| < 8. The analysis of rapidity gap events is not easy from the experimental point\nof view. To properly define a rapidity gap one should combine calorimeter clusters with Et above\na certain threshold into mini-jets using the kt algorithm. Then the total transverse energy in the\ngap is summed up, and clusters coming from obvious pileup events are discarded. The analysis\nof these events in ATLAS is still ongoing, so the effect of background and pileup in \"soiling\"\nthe gap is under study. Potentially, the fact that the fraction of rapidity gap events on the total\nof hedronic ones has to be independent on instantaneous luminosity (therefore on the amount of\npileup) can be a very powerful tool to determine the efficiency of pileup corrections. One could\nin fact plot the fraction of gap events as a function of the instantaneous luminosity, expecting this\nfraction to be decreasing as effect of pileup. Applying pileup corrections, this slope is expected\nto reduce, and the amount of this reduction will provide a measurement of the efficiency of these\ncorrections.\n4\n\nBeyond gaps, M\u00fcller-Navelet jets\n\nThe gluon ladder does not only predict an increase of events with large rapidity gaps. In case the\ngluon ladder also has additional external gluon lines, gluon jets will be emitted in the central part\nof the detector, between the two main jets. This emission will result in interesting QCD radiation\npatterns, and this additional radiation will spoil the back-to back nature of the two leading jets.\nThe de-correlation of the azimuthal angle between the two leading jets is expected to be one of\nthe first measurements with LHC data, since it does not require too detailed energy calibration.\nThese de-correlation effects should be already visible for values of \u2206\u03b7 accessible in the LHC\nexperiments, as discussed in [6].\nSo far, BFKL has been approximated in MonteCarlo by a Colour Dipole Model (CDM) [7],\navailable since years in ARIADNE [8], widely used at HERA.\nA third approach to QCD evolution, the CCFM equation [9] is based on kt factorisation,\nangular ordering (instead of kt as for DGLAP), and is a good approximation of the DGLAP\napproach at high-Q2 and of BFKL for low x. This equation is currently implemented in the\nCASCADE [10] code. Comparison of CDM and CCFM approaches to HERA data did not give\nconclusive results, that could on the other hand be obtained from a few days of LHC running.\nFor instance, the cross section for dijet events separated by \u2206\u03b7 of at least 2 is of the order of the\n\u03bcbarn. A recent advance has been the availability of a MonteCarlo code implementing the BFKL\nformalism [11], even if a proper comparison with data would require interface with hadronisation,\nnot yet available.\n\nMPI08\n\n215\n\n\f5\n\nMore diffractive topologies\n\nSo far we have considered events with forward-backward jets, with or without a rapidity gap\nin the middle. There are however many more diffractive topologies presently under study for\nthe first period of data-taking in ATLAS. The most studied are single diffraction, where one\nproton remains intact (and undetected), and a rapidity gap is present on the same side of the\ndetector. Another interesting topology is the Central Exclusive Production (CEP), where the\nexchange of two colour singlets lead to a final state where both protons stay intact, and two\nrapidity gaps are present, in the forward and backward region of the detector. The central activity\nis present in the form of dijets or exclusive final states. All energy lost by the protons goes in the\nmass of the central system, and a precision measurement of their momentum would allow high\nprecision in the determination of the mass of the central system. A detailed discussion of the\ndetector upgrades ATLAS (and CMS) are planning to install for the determination of the proton\nmomentum loss will be discussed in the next session.\nLacking, at least for the first phase, a dedicated proton tagger, the main problem to observe\nCEP with the first LHC data is a valid trigger strategy. The observable system is quite soft, and\nthe production of jets, dominated by QCD, will be heavily prescaled at trigger level. Requiring\nthe presence of rapidity gaps at L1 trigger level is possible in ATLAS using a detector designed\nto trigger on minimum-bias events at low luminosity, the Minimum- Bias Trigger Scintillators\n(MBTS). They are a set of 32 scintillators, arranged in two wheels, each covering the rapidity\nregion between 2 and 4. The aim of this detector is to provide a fast and simple trigger for\nminimum bias events, and due to radiation damage it will have to be removed after a few years\nof data taking. In this case, since we are looking at rapidity gaps, the MBTS are used as a veto,\nto select events where no particles are present in a given rapidity region. It was shown that a\nveto on both sides of the MBTS can reduce the QCD rate by a factor 10000, while keeping the\nefficiency to CEP of around 65%. In realistic data-taking conditions, the MBTS rate is expected\nto be higher, due to the more radioactive environment, so realistically both rejection factor and\nefficiency are expected to be smaller than these simulated figures.\nThe distribution of the energy lost by the incoming protons (therefore, the mass of the central system) is on average much smaller than 10\u22122 for diffractive events, while typical values for\nnon-diffractive interactions are in the 0.1-0.5 range. If no dedicated proton detector is present, we\ncan estimate the resolution on this variable of the order of 10%, only using the information from\nthe central calorimeters. Such a resolution is inadequate to distinguish a narrow resonance from\na much larger background (as it would be the case for a diffractively-produced Higgs boson), and\ndue to the steeply falling behaviour of this distribution, also leads to a shift in the measured mean\nvalue. In order to make a precise measurement of CEP processes, it is necessary to equip the\nLHC detectors of high-precision proton taggers, like those proposed to both ATLAS and CMS\nby the FP420 collaboration [1].\n6\n\nForward detectors at the LHC\n\nBoth LHC general-purpose detectors will be equipped by detectors in the forward region, extending far beyond the coverage of the calorimeters of about 5. In Atlas, the luminosity monitor\nLucid, based on detection of Cerenkov light, will cover (even if with limited azimuthal coverage\n216\n\nMPI08\n\n\ffor the first period) a rapidity region down to 6.2, while a zero-degree calorimeter, located at\nabout 150 meters from the interaction point, will measure neutral particles emitted almost parallel to the beam direction. None of these detectors will be however incapable of tagging or\nmeasuring the momentum of protons scattered off diffractive events. Since measuring them is\nquite important, and can be done in an elegant way using the LHC optics as a giant spectrometer,\na group of physicists, most of whom from the fp420 collaboration [1], is proposing to install two\ndetectors at 220 and 420 meters from the Atlas interaction point. The goal is to measure with\nhigh precision the position of the protons diffracted from the beam (and from that their momentum, using the LHC dipoles as a giant spectrometer), as well as their time of flight, in order to\ndistinguish particles coming from different vertexes in a high-pileup situation.\nThe stringent radiation hardness and speed requirements of the position detectors required\nthe development of a new technology. 3D silicon detectors (see figure 3), the result of a long R&D\nwork, have several advantages with respect to the planar geometry: they work with a smaller\ndepletion voltage, are more radiation hard and are faster since the drift is shorter. They can\noperate at few mm from the beam line, in both the 220 and 420 meter location. The requirements\non the timing detectors are also very stringent. The problem comes from the fact that at highpileup conditions a Central Exclusive Production event can be perfectly faked by the overlap of\na soft-QCD production event plus two single-diffractive interactions. The only way to separate\nthem is due to the fact that these overlapping events come from different vertexes, so if the vertex\nposition can be determined with a resolution of 2-3 mm, a sufficient background rejection can\nbe obtained. While such a resolution is easy to reach using tracks for the central system, the\nonly way to have good vertex resolution for the forward protons is to have a very precise (10 ps\nresolution) time of flight detector. So far, two technologies have been proposed, a gas tube with\na mirror at the end to detect Cerenkov light, and an array of quartz detectors, that also can focus\nCerenkov light into a multi-channel plate photomultiplier. So far, test-beam results indicate that a\nresolution of 10-20 ps can be obtained by the gas approach, while 20-30 ps can be reached by the\ngas detector, that on the other hand has a higher light yield and can be spatially segmented. R&D\nfor timing detectors is still going on, and maybe a combination of the two technology can offer\nthe advantages of both. To see how timing resolution can be important for the whole project,\nfigures 2 show the expected peak of a possible MSSM Higgs boson A (mA = 120 GeV, tan\u03b2=40,\n\u03c3(h \u2192 bb) = 17.9 fb) with time resolutions of 10 and 5 ps.\n6.1\n\nConclusions\n\nDiffractive and forward physics, due to their large cross-section and need for a low-pileup environment, will play a large role in the LHC startup. The main research topics will be:\n\u2022 the study of forward jets, both with and without rapidity gaps. The first analysis will measure the soft survival factor, and help understanding forward jets and rapidity gaps, while\nthe second will discriminate between different QCD evolution schemes. These studies will\nrequire a few tens of pb\u22121 of data\n\u2022 single diffraction, with one undetected proton and a matching rapidity gap, will provide\ncomplementary measurements on the interface between the jets and the gap. Its study will\nrequire a few hundreds of pb\u22121 .\n\u2022 Central exclusive production, with two rapidity gaps and a soft central system, will also\nMPI08\n\n217\n\n\fhelp understanding diffractive PDF's, Sudakov suppression factors, and discriminate among\ntheoretical models. A few hundreds of pb\u22121 are needed for a complete study of these events\nFor the future, ATLAS is planning to install a four-station proton tagger station to measure the\nmomentum loss of the forward protons, therefore the mass of the central system, and the accurate\ntime of flight, to distinguish genuine diffractive events from pileup background. Installation of\nthese detectors, still under approval, is foreseen by 2013-2014.\nReferences\n[1] arXiv:0806.0302v2 [hep-ex] .\n[2] V.N. Gribov, L,N. Lipatov. Sov.J.Nucl.Phys. 15:438 (1972). G.

Blok1\u2020, L. Frankfurt2 , M. Strikman3\ndepartment, Technion, Haifa, Israel\n2 Institute School of Physics and Astronomy, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel,\n3 Physics Department, Pensilvania State University, College Station, USA.\n1 Physics\n\nAbstract\nWe demonstrate the fundamental property of pQCD: smaller the size\nof the colorless quark-gluon configurations, the more rapid is the increase of its interaction with energy. In the limit of fixed Q2 and x \u2192 0\nwe find the increase with the energy of the transverse momenta of the\nquark(antiquark) within the q q\u0304 pair produced in the fragmentation region by the strongly virtual photon. Practical consequences of discovered effects is that the ratio of DVCS to DIS amplitudes should very\nslowly tend to one at very large collision energies, that a rapid projectile has the biconcave shape, which is different from the expectations\nof the preQCD parton model where a fast hadron has a pancake shape.\nWe found dominance of different phases of chiral and conformal symmetries in the central and peripheral pp, pA, and AA collisions.\n1\n\nIntroduction.\n\nA leading order dipole approximation Ref. [1\u20135], provides the solution of the equations of QCD\nin the kinematics of fixed and not too small x = Q2 /\u03bd but Q2 \u2192 \u221e. The characteristic feature\nof this solution is the approximate Bjorken scaling for the structure functions of DIS, i.e. the two\ndimensional conformal invariance for the moments of the structure functions. In this approximation as well as within the leading log(x0 /x) approximation, the transverse momenta of quarks\nwithin the dipole produced by the local electroweak current are restricted by the virtuality of the\nexternal field:\n\u039b2 \u2264 p2t \u2264 Q2 /4.\n(1)\nHere \u039b \u2261 \u039bQCD = 300 Mev is a QCD scale. It follows from the QCD factorization theorem\nproved in Refs. [6, 7] that within this kinematical range the smaller transverse size d of the\nconfiguration (the transverse distance between the constituents of the dipole) corresponds to a\nmore rapid increase of its interaction with the collision energy:\n\u03c3 = \u03b1s (c/d2 )F 2\n\n\u03c02 2\nd xGT (x, c/d2 ),\n4\n\n(2)\n\nhere F 2 = 4/3 or 9/4 depends whether the dipole consists of color triplet or color octet constituents, GT is an integrated gluon distribution function and c is a parameter c = 4 \u00f7 9. It is\n\u2020\n\nspeaker\n\n220\n\nMPI08\n\n\fwell known in the DGLAP approximation that the structure function GT (x, Q2 ) increases more\nrapidly with 1/x at larger Q2 . This property agrees well with the recent HERA data. The aim\nof the present talk is to demonstrate that the transverse momenta of the (anti)quark of the q q\u0304 pair\nproduced by a local current increase with the energy and become larger than Q2 /4 at sufficiently\nlarge energies. In other words the characteristic transverse momenta in the fragmentation region\nincrease with the energy. Technically this effect follows from the more rapid increase with the\nenergy of the pQCD interaction for smaller dipole and the kt factorization theorem.\nIt is worth noting that this kinematics is very different from the central rapidity kinematics where the increase of p2t was found in the leading \u03b1s log(x0 /x) BFKL approximation [8]:\nlog2 (p2t /p2t0 ) \u221d log(s/s0 ). Indeed, the latter rapid increase is absent in a fixed order of perturbation theory, and is the property of the ladder: the further we go along the ladder, the larger\nare characteristic transverse momenta, i.e. we have a diffusion in the space of transverse momenta [8]. On the other hand the property we are dealing here with is the property of a characteristic transverse momenta in the wave function of the projectile.\nThe dipole approximation provides the target rest frame description which is equivalent to\nthe Infinite Momentum Frame (IMF) description of DIS in LO DGLAP and BFKL approximations. To achieve equivalence with the IMF description in the NLO approximation it is necessary\nto calculate radiative corrections to cross section in the fragmentation region, i.e. to take into account the increase of the number of constituents and related renormalization of the dipole wave\nfunction. Recent calculations [9, 10] suggest that these corrections are small. Consequently in\nthe talk we will neglect these corrections.\nOur main result is that the median transverse momenta kt2 and invariant masses of the\nleading q q\u0304 pair in the fragmentation region grow as\n2\n\nkt2 \u223c a(Q2 )/(x/x0 )\u03bb(Q ) ,\n2\n\nM 2 \u223c b(Q2 )/(x/x0 )\u03bbM (Q ) .\n(3)\nHere kt2 and M 2 are the median squared transverse momentum and invariant mass of the quarkantiquark pair in the fragmentation region. (The median means that the configurations with\nthe momentum/masses less than the median one contribute half of the total crosssection). The\nexponential factors \u03bb and \u03bbM are both approximately \u223c 0.1. These factors are weakly dependent\non the external virtuality Q2 . The exact values also depend on the details of the process, i.e.\nwhether we consider the DIS process with longitudinal or transverse photons, as well as on the\nmodel and approximation used. The exact form of \u03bb(Q2 ), and \u03bbM (Q2 ) are given below.\nThe rapid increase of the characteristic transverse scales in the fragmentation region has\nbeen found first in Refs. [11\u201314], but within the black disk regime (BDR). Our new result is\nthe prediction of the increase with energy of the jet transverse momenta in the fragmentation\nregion/the rise of the transverse momenta in the impact factor with the energy, in the kinematical\ndomain where methods of pQCD are still applicable. This effect could be considered as a precursor of the black disk regime indicating the possibility of the smooth matching between two\nregimes.\nMPI08\n\n221\n\n\fOur results can be applied to a number of processes. First we consider the deeply virtual\nCompton scattering (DVCS) process, i.e. \u03b3 + p \u2192 \u03b3 \u2217 + p.\nWe also find that at sufficiently large energies\n\n\u03c3L (x, Q2 )/\u03c3T (x, Q2 ) \u221d (Q2 /4p2t ) \u221d (1/x)\u03bb .\n\n(4)\n\nHence the \u03c3L /\u03c3T ratio should decrease as the power of energy instead of being O(\u03b1s ).\nOur results have the implication for the space structure of the wave packet describing a\nrapid hadron. In the classical multiperipheral picture of Gribov a hadron has a shape of a pancake of the longitudinal size 1/\u03bc (where \u03bc is the scale of soft QCD) which does not depend on\nthe incident energy [17]. On the contrary, we find in section 5 the biconcave shape for the rapid\nhadron in pQCD with the minimal longitudinal length (that corresponds to small impact parameter b) decreasing with increase of energy and being smaller for nuclei than for the nucleons.\nFinally, in the last section we discuss the possible applications of our results to pp, pA\ncollisions at the LHC.\n2\n\nThe target rest frame description.\n\nWithin the LO approximation the QCD factorization theorem allows to express the total cross\nsection of the scattering of the longitudinally polarized photon with virtuality \u2212Q2 \ufffd \u039b2QCD off\na hadron target as the convolution of the square of the virtual photon wave function calculated in\nthe dipole approximation and the cross section of the dipole scattering off a hadron [1, 18, 19].\nIn the target rest frame the cross section for the scattering of longitudinally polarized photon has\nthe form :\n\u03c3(\u03b3L\u2217\n\ne2\n+ T \u2192 X) =\n12\u03c0 2\n\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\nd2 pt dz \u03c8\u03b3L\u2217 (pt , z)\ufffd \u03c3(s, p2t ) \ufffd\u03c8\u03b3L\u2217 (pt , z) .\n\nHere \u03c3 is the dipole crosssection operator:\n\n(5)\n\n\ufffd t ) * xG(x\u0303 = (M 2 + Q2 )/s, 4p2t ),\n\u03c3 = F 2 * \u03c0 2 \u03b1s (4p2t )(\u2212\u2206\n\n(6)\n\n\ufffd t is the two dimensional Laplace operator in the space of the transverse momenta, and\nhere \u2206\n2\nM = (p2t + m2q )/z(1 \u2212 z) is the invariant mass squared of the dipole. In the coordinate representation \u03c3 is just a number function, and not a differential operator as in the momentum\nrepresentation.\nIntegrating by parts over pt it is easy to rewrite Eq. 5 with the LO accuracy in the form\nwhere the integrand is explicitly positive:\n\u03c3(\u03b3L\u2217 + T \u2192 X) =\nhere\n\ne2\n12\u03c0 2\n\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\n\u03b1s (4p2t )d2 pt dz \u2207\u03c8\u03b3L\u2217 (pt , z)\ufffd f (s, z, p2t ) \ufffd\u2207\u03c8\u03b3L\u2217 (pt , z) ,\n\nf = (4\u03c0 2 /3)\u03b1s (4p2t )xG(x\u0303, 4p2t ).\n\n(7)\n(8)\n\nIn the derivation we use the boundary conditions that follow from the fact that the photon wave\nfunction decreases rapidly in the p2t \u2192 \u221e limit and that the contribution of small pt is the higher\ntwist effect.\n222\n\nMPI08\n\n\fEq. 7 can be explicitly rewritten in terms of integration in kt2 and z as\n\ufffd 2 2 2\ufffd\neq F Q\n\nkt2\n* g(x\u0303, 4kt2 ).\n12\n(kt2 + Q2 z(1 \u2212 z))4\n(9)\nwhere x\u0303 is given by (kt2 /((z(1 \u2212 z) + Q2 )/s. Here we take into account explicitly the (rather\nweak) z-dependence of the integrand.\n\u03c3L (x, Q ) = 6\u03c0\n2\n\n\u03c0\u03b1e.m.\n\ndkt2 \u03b1s (4kt2 )z 2 (1 \u2212 z)2\n\nThe similar derivation can be made for the scattering of transverse photon in configurations of spatially small size. In this case the contribution of small pt region (Aligned Jet Model\ncontribution) is comparable to the pQCD one. The main interest in this paper is in the region\nof high energies (HERA and beyond) i.e. sufficiently small x\u0303, and small Q2 , where pQCD contribution dominates because of the rapid increase of the gluon distribution with the decrease of\nx. We include a contribution of the aligned jet configurations by imposing a cutoff in transverse\nmomenta (see below for the details).\nThe pQCD contribution into the total cross section initiated by the transverse photon has\nthe form:\n\u03c3T\n\n\ufffd\n\n\u03c0\u03b1e.m. e2q F 2\n= 6\u03c0\n12\n\u00d7\n\n\ufffd 1\n0\n\ndz\n\n\ufffd\n\ndkt2 \u03b1s (4kt2 )(z 2 + (1 \u2212 z)2 )\n\n(kt4 + Q4 z 2 (1 \u2212 z)2 )\n* g(x\u0303, 4kt2 ).\n(k 2 + Q2 z(1 \u2212 z))4\n(10)\n\nIn the numerical calculations using Eq. 10 we introduced a cutoff in the space transverse momenta M 2 z(1 \u2212 z) \u2265 u, u \u223c 0.35 GeV2 . The contribution of smaller kt2 in the total crosssection\nwas calculated using the AJM model.\n3\n\nThe characteristic transverse momenta in hard fragmentation processes in LO approximation.\n\nHere we carry out the calculations for realistic energies and realistic structure functions. The\nnumerical results indicate that the effects discussed above are manifest even at the energies of\nthe order s \u223c 105 \u00f7 107 GeV2 . We want to draw attention that our main qualitatively new\nresult-the increase of the parton transverse momenta in the current fragmentation region should\nbe valid in NLO, NNLO approximations as well because its derivation uses specific property of\nDGLAP approximation to pQCD -a larger virtuality leads to a more rapid increase of amplitude\nwith energy. We will also consider the extrapolation of our results to energies of the order s \u223c\n107 GeV2 . These energies are unattainable at existing facilities. The proposed e-p collider at\nLHC may reach the invariant energies of order 106 GeV2 . However these results are interesting\nfrom the theoretical point of view- probing the limits of the pQCD. The relation of our results to\nthe processes at the LHC will be discussed in the last section.\nChallenging and unresolved problem is how to use resummation methods at extremely\nsmall x [20, 21] to evaluate dependence on energy of parton distribution in the current fragmentation region. At x achieved at HERA account of the energy-momentum conservation restricts\nMPI08\n\n223\n\n\fthe number of possible gluon emissions by one-two. Such emissions are correctly accounted for\nwithin NLO, NNLO DGLAP approximation. One can substantiate this point by evaluation of\nthe number of radiated gluons in the multiRegge kinematics [13]. At extremely small x where\nnumber of gluon radiations would be sufficiently large and therefore essential impact parameters would exceed radius of a nucleon the intercept of pQCD Pomeron may become independent\non Q2 as a result of diffusion in the space of transverse momenta. This interesting problem is\nbeyond the scope of this paper.\n3.1\n\nThe longitudinal photons.\n\nIn the case of longitudinal photons we have considered the characteristic median/average transverse momenta scale, that corresponds to the half of the total crosssection \u03c3L . This scale is determined from Eq. 9 by first integrating over z for given kt , and then analyzing the corresponding\njet distribution. In Figure 1 we present the characteristic graphs for the ratio\nR(kt2 ) =\n\n\u03c3(kt2 )\n,\n\u03c3L\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03c3(kt2 ) corresponds to the result of integration of Eq.9 over transverse momenta \u2264 kt2 . We\nsee from Fig. 1, that for fixed kt R(kt ) slowly increases with the increase of the energy. The\nresults based on using CTEQ5 parametrization are qualitatively similar, although the increase of\nmedian kt2 with the energy is more rapid. The energy dependence of median kt2 can be described\n2\n2\nwith a very good accuracy by an approximate formula (x/0.01)0.04+0.025 log(Q /Q0 ) . Here Q20 =\n10 GeV2 ,x0 \u223c 0.01. The power increases from \u223c 0.04 at Q2 \u223c 5 GeV2 , to 0.09 at Q2 \u223c 100\nGeV2 . For CTEQ5 this power increases to 0.1 at Q2 = 100GeV 2 instead of 0.09. This is\nconsistent with the enhanced rate of the increase of CTEQ5 structure functions as compared to\nthe CTEQ6 ones (see below).\nThese results allow us to estimate the scales, where one expects the appearance of the new\nQCD regime, i.e. one has to use the kt factorization approach. Indeed, the DGLAP approximation is based on the strong ordering in all rungs of the ladder, in particular in the first rung\n(the impact factor in the 4kt factorization language ) we must have 4\u039b2QCD \u2264 4kt2 \u2264 Q2 . It is\n2 becomes of order Q2 . Then we obtain\nclear, this ordering can not hold, once the median 4ktm\nthe condition (using CTEQ6 distribution functions):\n2 /Q2 )\n0\n\n4a(Q2 )/(x/0.01)0.04+0.025 log(Q\n\n\u223c Q2 .\n\n(12)\n\nHere the function a corresponds to the transverse momenta at x = 0.01.\nThe numerical calculations show that for Q2 = 5 GeV2 one gets from eq. 12 x \u223c 10\u22124 ,\nfor\n= 10 GeV2 one gets x \u223c 10\u22126 , which may be reached at LeHC. For larger Q2 we are\nhowever beyond the realistic energies: say for Q2 \u223c 20 GeV2 we need x \u223c 10\u22129 . The use of\nCTEQ5 gives qualitatively the same results (for Q2 = 30 GeV2 we obtain x \u223c 10\u22128 . Thus we\nmay hope to observe the onset of the new regime for the kt dependence analyzing small x jet\ndistributions at LeHC/LHC. rations.\nQ2\n\n224\n\nMPI08\n\n\f3.2\n\nTransverse photons\n\nWe performed the numerical analysis for the transverse photons using eqs. 9,10 in the same fashion as for the longitudinal photons. In Figure 2 we depicted the characteristic function R(kt2 )\ngiven by Eq. 11 that gives the characteristic momenta as a function of x for several different val2\n2\nues of Q2 . The characteristic energy dependence for median kt2 is (x/0.01)0.09+0.014 log(Q /Q0 )\nwhere x0 = 0.01, Q20 = 10 GeV2 . The curves in Fig. 2 clearly show that the characteristic\nmomenta increase with the increase of 1/x, as the corresponding curves slowly shift to the right.\nWe see that the average transverse momenta for longitudinal photons is significantly larger\nthan for transverse photons. On the other hand, the invariant masses for transverse photons\nare always significantly larger than 4kt2 . This is due to the large contribution of the AJM type\nconfigurations with z \u223c 0, 1 (z is the fraction of the total momentum of the dipole carried by\none of its constituents). Since M 2 = kt2 /(z(1 \u2212 z)), a more slow increase of M 2 than of kt2\nis consistent with the slow increase of average z towards 1/2, i.e. the symmetric configurations\nbecome dominant, but only at asymptotically large energies.\nOnce again, we can estimate the boundary of the region where the direct DGLAP approach stops being self-consistent. Assuming kt2 \u223c Q2 /4, we obtain that the boundary for\nQ2 = 3, 5, 10 GeV2 is reached at x \u223c 10\u22123 , 10\u22124 , 10\u22126 . For higher Q2 this boundary lies at\nunrealistically high energies. The use of the CTEQ5 parametrization gives qualitatively the same\nresults.\nSo far we considered only perturbative QCD contribution, and the median transverse momentum was determined relative to the total perturbative crosssection, i.e. the one starting from\nthe cut off u = 0.35 GeV2 . It is well known that even at HERA energies the contribution of\nAJM into the total crosssection is significant. The corresponding AJM contribution to the total\ncrosssection is given in fig. 3a. Note that the median kt2 at small virtualities at HERA energies\nsignificantly decreases if we calculate it using the crosssection that includes both the pQCD and\nsoft (AJM) contributions. For example, at Q2 \u223c 10 GeV2 the median transverse momentum\nsquared decreases by almost a factor of two down to kt2 \u223c 0.65 GeV2 .\n4\n\nDeeply virtual Compton scattering.\n\nAs the application of the formulae obtained in this paper we shall consider the DVCS processes\n\u03b3 + p \u2192 \u03b3 \u2217 + p. We shall show that the slow increase in the median transverse momenta leads\nto the slow decrease of the ratio R = ADVCS /ACS with energy to the limiting value equal one.\nThe DCVS amplitude is described in pQCD by the same formula 10 as the amplitude\ndescribing total cross section of DIS at given x, Q2 but with the substitution in Eq.7 of the wave\nfunction of virtual photon by wave function of a real photon, i.e. Q2 = 0.\nAs a result in pQCD R has the form :\nRpQCD\n\n\ufffd1\n\n\ufffd\n\ndz dM 2 \u03b1s (M 2 z(1 \u2212 z))(1/(M 2 + Q2 )2 ) * g(x\u0303, M 2 ).\n= \ufffd1 \ufffd\n2\n2\n4\n4\n2\n2 4\n2\n0 dz dM \u03b1s (M z(1 \u2212 z))((M + Q )/(M + Q ) )) * g(x\u0303, M ).\n0\n\n(13)\n\nLet us note that strictly speaking, we must use the generalized parton distributions (GPD)\nin Eq. 13. However the difference between gluon GPD and gluon pdf is not large in this case\nMPI08\n\n225\n\n\fbecause fractions carried by gluons in GPD differ by the factor \u2248 two at moderate x and tend to\none at extremely large energies as the consequence of increase of parton momenta with energy.\n(In fact most of the non-diagonal effect in this approach is included in the wave functions of the\ninitial and final photons.) As a result we may neglect the difference between GPD and distribution\nfunctions in the considered kinematics. The numerical analysis of Eq. 13 shows that indeed the\nratio R very slowly decreases with the increase of energy due to a slow increase of a ratio M 2 /Q2\ndiscussed in the previous section, and R \u223c 1.6 for HERA energies.\n\nThe result Eq. 13 is however not complete since we neglected the contribution of the AJ\nconfigurations. In this paper we take them into account using the AJM model [37] (and references\ntherein, see also Appendix B of this paper). Indeed as we see from Fig. 3a, the AJ configurations\ngive a substantial contribution to the total crosssection of the DIS of the transverse photons. We\nrefer the reader to appendix B and ref. [24] for the discussion of main properties of the AJM.\nWe see that the AJM contribution to the total crosssection is of order 70% at Q2 \u223c 1 GeV2 ,\nx \u223c 0.01.\nRough estimate gives\n\nRAJM \u2248 2,\n\n(14)\n\nsince the major difference in the amplitudes describing total cross section of DIS and DCVS is in\n2 +M 2\nthe difference between the wave functions of the virtual and real photons-the factor Q Q\n\u2248 2.\n2\n2\n2\nBut in the essential region of integration M \u2248 Q . In the framework of the AJM model the\nratio of amplitudes of the DVCS to DIS can be calculated within the leading twist approximation\nas:\nQ2 + m20\nQ2\nRAJM =\nlog(1\n+\n).\n(15)\nQ2\nm20\nHere the parameter m20 = 0.3 \u2212 0.5 GeV2 is the cut off parameter m20 \u2264 m2\u03c1 , m\u03c1 is the \u03c1 meson\nmass.\nCombining the pQCD and AJ model contributions we have\nR=\n\nRpQCD \u03c3T + RAJM \u03c3AJM\n.\n\u03c3T + \u03c3AJM\n\n(16)\n\nHere the pQCD contribution into the total crosssection \u03c3T is given by Eq. 10 and the\ncontribution of AJ to the total crosssection is given by AJM - Eq. 15. The results of numerical\ncalculation as a function of x for several values of Q2 are depicted in Fig. 3b. The ratio R is close\nto 2 at HERA energies and increases with Q2 (from 5 to 100 GeV2 by \u223c 40%). This result is in\na good agreement with the analysis of the H1 and ZEUS data in Ref. [15] (see in particular Table\n4 in Ref. [15]). Our main prediction is that the ratio R should decreases with the rise of energy.\nIt tends to one at asymptotically large energies in agreement with the result for the BDR [25].\nHowever the onset of this regime is very slow. This prediction can be checked experimentally in\nthe study of DVCS processes at LHeC.\nOur conclusion on the important role of AJM contribution in DVCS at HERA energies is\nin the qualitative agreement with the recent experimental data [16] that shows the important role\nof soft QCD in the diffractive processes in DIS at HERA.\n226\n\nMPI08\n\n\fWe want to draw attention that agreement between experimental results and theoretical\nprediction is rather good. This is due to the fact that the interaction of dipole effectively includes\nthe NLO corrections since parton distributions were obtained by fitting the experimental data.\nConsequently one may hope that NLO corrections to impact factors are relatively small.\nLet us stress that the current calculation is preliminary. More detailed calculation should\naccount for the contribution of c-quark, and study in detail the dependence of R on the AJM\nparameters).\n5\n\nThe shape of the fast nucleon and nuclei.\n\nThe coherence length lc corresponds to the life-time of the dipole fluctuation at a given energy\nin the rest frame of the target. Within the parton model approximation the coherence length is\nlc \u223c 1/2mN x [26] i.e. it linearly increases with energy. In pQCD as a result of QCD evolution\ncoherence length increases with energy more slowly [27, 28]:\nlc = (1/2mN x)(s0 /s)\u03bb .\n\n(17)\n\nSuch energy dependence of the coherence length shows that the wave function of a fast hadron\ndiffers in QCD from that in the Gribov picture [17] .\nLet us consider the longitudinal distribution of the partons in a fast hadron. In the parton\nmodel the longitudinal spread of the gluonic cloud is Lz \u223c 1/\u03bc for the wee partons (where \u03bc\nis the soft scale) and it is much larger than for harder partons, with Lz \u223c 1/xPh for partons\ncarrying a finite x fraction of the hadron momentum [17]. The picture is changed qualitatively\nin the limit of very high energies when interactions reach BD regime for kt \ufffd \u03bc. In this case\nthe smallest possible characteristic momenta in the frame where hadron is fast are of the order\nkt (BDR) which is a function of both initial energy and transverse coordinate, b of the hadron.\nCorrespondingly, the longitudinal size is \u223c 1/kt (BDR) \ufffd 1/\u03bc. There is always a tail to the\nmuch smaller momenta all the way down to kt \u223c \u03bc which corresponds to the partons with\nmuch larger longitudinal size (a pancake of soft gluons corresponding to the Gribov's picture).\nHowever at large energies at the proximity of the unitarity limit the contribution of the gluons\nwith kt < ktb is strongly suppressed. In the BDR this tail is suppressed by a factor kt2 /kt (BDR)2\n[12, 30]. In the color glass condensate model the suppression is exponential [31].\nSince the gluon parton density decreases with the increase of b the longitudinal size of the\nhadron is larger for large b, so a hadron has a shape of biconcave lens, see Figs. 4(a),4(b)\nIn the numerical calculation we took\n|lz | = 1/kt (BDR),\n\n(18)\n\nneglecting overall factors of the order of one (typically in the Fourier transform one finds \ufffdz\ufffd \u223c\n\u03c0\n2\n2\n\ufffdpz \ufffd ). We calculated kt (BDR) for fixed external virtuality Q0 \u223c 40GeV . Our results are not\nsensitive to the value of Q20 , as the value of Q2 only enters in the combination x\ufffd = (Q20 +M 2 )/s,\nand the kt2 we found were comparable or larger than Q20 /4. Indeed, the direct calculation shows\nthat for small b the change of 1/kt if we go between external virtualities of 60 and 5 GeV2 is\nless than 5%. Such weak dependence continues almost to the boundary of the picture Fig. 4a,\nMPI08\n\n227\n\n\fwhere kt \u223c 1 GeV. Near the boundary the uncertainty increase to \u223c 25%, meaning that for large\nb (beyond those depicted in Fig. 4a) the nucleon once again becomes a pancake and there is a\nsmooth transition between two pictures ( biconcave lens and pancake). We want to emphasize\nhere that the discussed above weak dependence of kt (BDR) on the resolution scale indicates\nthat the shape of the wave function for small x is almost insensitive to the scale of the probe.\nWe depict the typical transverse quark structure of the fast nucleon in Fig. 4a. We see that\nit is drastically different from the naive picture of a fast moving nucleon as a flat narrow disk with\nsmall constant thickness. (Similar plot for the gluon distribution is even more narrow). Note also\nthat for the discussed small x range kt \u2265 1GeV /c for b \u2264 1f m. Since the spontaneous chiral\nsymmetry breaking corresponds\nto quark virtuality \u03bc2 \u2264 1GeV 2 , probably \u223c 0.7GeV 2 [33],\n\ufffd\ncorresponding to kt \u223c 23 \u03bc2 \u223c 0.7GeV /c the chiral symmetry should be restored for a large\nrange of b in the proton wave function for small x.\nLet us consider the DIS on the nuclei for the case of external virtualities of the order of\nseveral GeV. In this case the shadowing effects to the large extent cancel the factor A1/3 in the\ngluon density of a nucleus for a central impact parameters, b [32], and the gluon density in the\nnuclei is comparable to that in a single nucleon for b \u223c 0. Consequently over the large range of\nthe impact parameters the nucleus longitudinal size is approximately the same as in the nucleon\nat b \u223c 0.\nGeV2 .\n\nHowever for very small x we find large kt (BDR) corresponding to 4kt2 (BDR) \u2265 40\nThis is a self consistent value as indeed for such Q2 the leading twist shadowing is small.\n\nAccordingly we calculated the shape of the nucleus for the external virtuality Q2 \u2265 40\nWe should emphasize here that taking a smaller virtuality would not significantly change\nour result for kt (BDR) (at the same time LT nuclear shadowing reduces a low momentum tail\nof the kt distribution as compared to the nucleon case).\nGeV2 .\n\nIn the discussed limit of the small leading twist shadowing, the corresponding gluon density unintegrated over b is given by a product of a nucleon gluon density and the nuclear profile\nfunction:\n\ufffd\nT (b) = dz\u03c1(b, z),\n(19)\n\nwhere the nuclear three-dimensional density is normalized to A. We use standard Fermi step\nparametrization [34]\n\u03c1(r) = C(A)\n\nA\n, RA = 1.1A1/3 fm, a = 0.56fm.\n1 + exp((r \u2212 RA )/a)\n\n(20)\n\n\u221a\nHere r = z 2 + b2 , and A is the atomic number.\nC(A) is a normalization factor, that can\n\ufffd\nbe calculated numerically from the condition d3 r\u03c1(r) = A. At the zero impact parameter\nT (b) \u2248 0.5A1/3 for large A.\n\nThe dependence of the thickness of a fast nucleus as a function of the transverse size is\ndepicted in Fig. 4b for a typical high energy s = 107 GeV2 , Q2 = 40 GeV2 . We see that the\nnuclei also has a form of a biconcave lens instead of a flat disk. The dependence on the external\nvirtuality for the nuclei is qualitatively very similar to the case of the nucleon. For small b the\ndependence is very weak (of order 5%) and increases only close to the boundary of the biconcave\n228\n\nMPI08\n\n\flens region where it is of order 20% ( and kt \u223c 1 GeV). For larger b we smoothly return to the\npancake picture.\nNote that this picture is very counterintuitive: the thickness of a nucleus is smaller than\nof a nucleon in spite of \u223c A1/3 nucleons at the same impact parameter. The resolution of the\nparadox in the BD regime is quite simple: the soft fields of individual nucleons destructively\ninterfere cancelling each other. Besides for a given impact parameter b, the longitudinal size\n(A)\n(p)\nof a heavy nucleus 1/kt (BDR) < 1/kt (BDR) since the gluon distribution function in the\nnuclei GA (x, b) > GN (x, b). So a naive classical picture of a system build of the constituents\nbeing larger than each of the constituents is grossly violated. The higher density of partons leads\nto the restoration of the chiral symmetry in a broad b range and much larger x range than in the\nnucleon case.\n6\n\nExperimental consequences.\n\nThe current calculations of the cross sections of the hard processes at the LHC are based on the\nuse of the DGLAP parton distributions and the application of the factorization theorem. Our\nresults imply that in the kinematical region of sufficiently small x it is necessary to use the kt\nfactorization and the dipole model, instead of the direct use of DGLAP.\nA similar analysis must be made for the pp collisions at LHC. It has been understood long\nago that the probability of pp collisions at central impact parameter is close to 100% (total \u0393 is\nclose to 1) even for soft QCD, i.e. at lesser energies than those necessary to achieve BDR for the\nhard interactions. The compatibility of probability conservation with the rapid increase of hard\ninteractions with energy, predicted by QCD, requires the decrease of importance of soft QCD\ncontribution with energy [36]. As a result the hadronic state emerged in pp, pA, AA collisions\nat sufficiently large energies consists of two phases. Central collisions would be dominated\nby the strong interaction with small coupling constant - the phase with unbroken chiral and\nconformal symmetries. On the contrary, the peripheral collisions are dominated by the more\nfamiliar phase with broken chiral and conformal symmetries. At these energies the QCD phase\nat central collisions - with the unbroken chiral and conformal symmetries -will be different from\nthat for the peripheral collisions. This new phenomenon may appear especially important for the\ncentral heavy ion collisions at LHC and at RHIC. Quantitative analysis of this problem will be\npresented elsewhere.\nThe hard processes initiated by the real photon can be directly observed in the ultrapheripheral collisions [35]. The processes where a real photon scatters on a target, and creates two\njets with an invariant mass M 2 , can be analyzed in the dipole model by formally putting Q2 = 0,\nwhile M 2 is an invariant mass of the jets. In this case with a good accuracy the spectral density\ndiscussed above will give the spectrum of jets in the fragmentation region. Our results show that\nthe jet distribution over the transverse momenta will be broad with the maximum moving towards\nlarger transverse momenta with increase of the energy and centrality of the \u03b3A collision.\nWe have seen that our results can also describe DCVS processes. The ratio R of DCVS\n\u2192 \u03b3 \u2217 and forward amplitudes at t = 0 is of order 2 at HERA energies at small external\nvirtualities, and rapidly growing with Q2 . This ratio slowly decreases with the decrease of x.\n\u03b3\u2217\n\nFinally, our results can be checked directly, if and when the LHeC facility will be built at\nMPI08\n\n229\n\n\fCERN.\nMore detailed version of this work can be found in Ref.

One reason is that MPI, although extending\nwell into the perturbative region, have their biggest impact close to, or inside, the nonperturbative\nregime. Another is that MPI studies by necessity probe all the main physics aspects of hadron\ncolliders in an nontrivial admixture, including multiple partonic collisions, initial- and finalstate radiation, beam remnant structure, colour flow issues, the impact-parameter picture, and\nhadronization.\nIf the study of MPI has for the first time become fashionable within the particle physics\ncommunity, it is in large part owing to the interplay between experimental studies and Monte\nCarlo modelling and tuning in recent years. Specifically, the CDF studies, already reviewed by\nRick Field, have largely relied on the availability of generators that could provide a framework\nfor the interpretation of the data. One case in point is that a unified description of mimimum-bias\nand underlying-event physics comes about quite naturally in MPI-based Monte Carlo implementations. Conversely, the renewed interest in improving and tuning models that have lain dormant\nfor many years would not have happened without the influx of new data to digest.\nThe session on Monte Carlo Models collects talks within two areas. Firstly presentations\nof several of the main generators, with an overview of new ideas and current status. Secondly\npresentations of new tunes of these generators, which also introduce new tools that allow a more\nsystematic approach to the whole tuning effort. But it should be emphasized that event generators\nare central to many other studies presented at this meeting, in particular in sessions I and II.\nSince it is all too easy to get carried away by the \"Yes, we can\" spirit that exists in the MPI\ncommunity nowadays, in this introduction we would still like to remind the reader that many\ntough issues remain poorly understood and modelled. Thus there is still scope for significant\nimprovements in the future, driven both by theoretical insights and experimental studies. Several\nsuch topics made for corridor talk during the meeting, but are maybe not so well represented in\nthe individual writeups, so here are a few examples:\n\u2022 How to model and measure multi-parton density functions, that depend on multiple flavour\nchoices and multiple x and Q2 scales?\n\u2022 How does close-packing of partons in the initial state, especially at small x, tie in with the\nfunctioning of the colour screening mechanism?\n\u2022 Currently implemented MC models of MPI assume a factorisation between the x-dependence\nand impact-parameter profile of the incoming hadrons. Can this assumption be relaxed, and\nif so how large would the effect be?\n\u2022 Can the presence of rescattering events, i.e. where an incoming parton scatters twice or\nmore, be established experimentally, given that the natural signal of three outgoing jets\ncompetes with a large QCD bremsstrahlung background?\nMPI08\n\n237\n\n\f\u2022 Can the initial-state branchings intertwine several 2 \u2192 2 processes that are seemingly\nseparate, and if so how?\n\u2022 A large amount of colour reconnection is favoured by the tunes of P YTHIA to \ufffdp\u22a5 \ufffd(ncharged )\ndata; but is this the correct interpretation and, if so, what is the physics and what are the\nrules that govern colour reconnection?\n\u2022 To what extent can colour reconnection also affect the pattern of perturbative QCD radiation? Can e.g. two dipoles each stretched between a final-state parton and (the hole left\nbehind by) an initial-state one transform into a single dipole between the two final-state\npartons?\n\u2022 Does the dense-packing of colour-field \"strings\" in central collisions induce states that\nborder on a quark-gluon plasma?\n\u2022 Does the hadronization of these topologies give rise to a dense hadron gas within which\nfinal-state rescatterings occur?\n\u2022 Given the above uncertainties, can we still assume that the composition of different particle\nspecies should be the same in hadronic collisions as in e+ e\u2212 ones?\n\u2022 How big a baryon-flow from the beam remnants to the central region should we expect?\n\u2022 How far can eikonal models be trusted to correctly relate different event topologies, including diffractive ones? Is maybe instead colour reconnection the proper way to think\nabout the emergence of diffractive topologies?\n\u2022 When tuning, how should the relative importance of various data be judged? When are\ndiscrepancies due to poor physics or to poorly documented data? How can we avoid overtuning, i.e. avoid forcing the model to fit the data even if the data contain physics not\nincluded in the model? (Many experimental working groups and applications apply pressure to fit the data at any cost.)\n\u2022 Can meaningful uncertainties be attached to MC tunes, in particular for MPI? How far can\nparticular physical effects be ruled out, or shown unambiguously to be present, based upon\nsuch tunes?\nIn summary, the pride of recent successes should not blind us to the challenges ahead. The\nLHC may well have surprises in store for us.\n\n238\n\nMPI08\n\n\fSoft interactions in Herwig++\nManuel B\u00e4hr1\u2020, Jonathan M. Butterworth2 , Stefan Gieseke1 , Michael H.

This allows the program to describe also minimum bias collisions in which there is no hard interaction, for the first\ntime. It is publicly available from versions 2.3 onwards and describes\nthe Tevatron underlying event and minimum bias data. The extrapolations to the LHC nevertheless suffer considerable ambiguity, as we\ndiscuss.\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn this talk, we will summarize the development of a new model for the underlying event in Herwig++, extending the previous perturbative multi-parton interaction (MPI) model down into the\nsoft non-perturbative region. This allows minimum bias collisions to be simulated by Herwig++\nfor the first time.\nWe begin, though, by mentioning a few of the features that accompanied it in the release of Herwig++ [1] version 2.3 [2] in December 2008, which include NLO corrections in the\nPOWHEG scheme for single W and Z production [3], and Higgs production [4]. Lepton\u2013hadron\nscattering processes have been included for the first time. The simulation of physics beyond the\nstandard model (BSM) has been extended to include a much wider range of 3-body decays and\noff-shell effects [5]. The treatment of baryon decays has been extended to match the sophistication of meson and tau decays, including off-shell and form factor effects and spin correlations.\nFinally, in addition to the soft interactions discussed here, the MPI model has been extended\nto include the possibility of selecting additional scatters of arbitrary type, which can be important backgrounds to BSM signatures for which the single-scattering backgrounds are small, for\nexample two like-sign Drell-Yan W productions [6].\nThe semi-hard MPI model was implemented in Herwig++ version 2.1 [7]. It allows for\nthe simulation of underlying events with perturbative scatters with pt > pmin\naccording to the\nt\nstandard QCD matrix elements with standard PDFs, dressed by parton showers that, in the initial state, account for the modifications of the proton structure due to momentum and flavour\nconservation. It essentially re-implemented the existing Jimmy algorithm [8] that worked with\nthe fortran HERWIG generator [9], but gave a significantly better description of the CDF data\non the underlying event [10], in part due to a more detailed global tuning [11]. However it was\n\u2020\n\nspeaker\n\nMPI08\n\n239\n\n\fonly able to describe the jet production part of the data, above about 20 GeV, and not the minimum bias part, owing to a lack of soft scatters below pmin\nt . A possible extension into the soft\nregime was first discussed in Ref. [12], but we have provided the first robust implementation\nof it, described in detail in Ref. [6]. It is somewhat complementary to the approach used in\nPythia [13, 14], where the perturbative scatters are extended into the soft region through the use\nof a smooth non-perturbative modification. However, we make a stronger connection with information on total and elastic scattering cross sections, available through the eikonal formalism, to\nplace constraints on our non-perturbative parameters [15].\nIn the remainder of this introduction,\nwe recap the basics of the eikonal model\nand recall the results of the perturbative MPI\nmodel that we had previously implemented in\nHerwig++, before showing how to extend it\ninto the soft region. In Sect. 2 we discuss the\nconstraints that can be placed on the model by\nthe connection with hadronic scattering, and\nin Sect. 3 we show the predictions for final\nstate properties.\nThe starting point for the MPI model is\nthe observation that the inclusive cross section\nfor perturbative parton scattering may exceed\nthe total hadron\u2013hadron cross section. We\nshow an example in Fig. 1, with two of the total cross section parameterizations we will be\nFig. 1: Total cross sections (black) in the two parameteriusing. The origin of the steep rise in the parzations of Donnachie and Landshoff [16, 17]. In blue the\ntonic cross section is the proliferation of parQCD jet production cross section above 2 GeV is shown.\ntons expected at small x. The excess of the\npartonic scattering cross section over the total\ncross section simply implies that there is on average more than one parton scattering per inelastic hadronic collision, n\u0304 = \u03c3jet /\u03c3inel . Since the majority of scatters come from very small x\npartons, they consume relatively little energy and it is a good approximation to treat them as\nquasi-independent.\nFrom the optical theorem, one derives a relationship between the Fourier transform of the\nelastic amplitude a(b, s) and the inelastic cross section via the eikonal function, \u03c7(b, s),\n\ufffd\n1 \ufffd \u2212\u03c7(b,s)\ne\n\u22121\na(b, s) \u2261\n2i\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\n\u03c3inel =\n\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\nd2 b 1 \u2212 e\u22122\u03c7(b,s) .\n\n(1)\n\nOne can construct a QCD prediction for the eikonal function by assuming that multiple scatters\nare independent, and that the partons that participate in them are distributed across the face of the\nhadron with some impact parameter distribution G(b) that is independent of their longitudinal\nmomentum,\n\u03c7QCD (b, s) =\n240\n\n1\n2\n\ninc\nA(b) \u03c3hard\n(s),\n\nA(b) =\n\n\ufffd\n\nd2 b\ufffd G(b\ufffd ) G(b \u2212 b\ufffd ),\n\n(2)\nMPI08\n\n\finc is the inclusive partonic scattering cross section, which is given by the conventional\nwhere \u03c3hard\nperturbative calculation.\n\nIn the original Jimmy model and its Herwig++ reimplementation, these formulae are implemented in a straightforward way, with the hard cross section defined by a strict cut, pt > pmin\nt\nand the matter distribution given by the Fourier transform of the electromagnetic form factor,\nG(b) =\n\n\ufffd\n\nd2 k\nei k*b\n,\n(2\u03c0)2 (1 + k2 /\u03bc2 )2\n\n(3)\n\nwith, to reflect the fact that the distribution of soft partons might not be the same as that of\nelectromagnetic charge, \u03bc2 considered to be a free parameter and not fixed to its electromagnetic\nvalue 0.71 GeV2 . Compared to a Gaussian of the same width, this distribution has both a stronger\npeak and a broader tail so it is somewhat similar to the double-Gaussian form used in Pythia [18].\nIn Ref. [15], we explicitly showed that the two result in similar distributions, if their widths are\nfixed to be equal, except very far out in the tails. \u03bc2 and pmin\nare the main adjustable parameters\nt\nof the model and, allowing them to vary freely, one can get a good description of the CDF\nunderlying event data, as shown in Fig. 2. The choice of parton distribution function can also be\nseen to have a small but significant effect.\nThe main shortcoming of this model is that it does not contain soft scatters and hence\ncannot describe very low pt jet production or minimum bias collisions. In Ref. [12] it was\nproposed to remedy this, by extending the concept of independent partonic scatters right down\ninto the infrared region. One can therefore write the eikonal function as the incoherent sum of\nthe QCD component we already computed and a soft component,\n\u03c7tot (b, s) = \u03c7QCD (b, s) + \u03c7soft (b, s) =\n\n1\n2\n\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\ninc\ninc\nA(b) \u03c3hard\n(s) + Asoft (b) \u03c3soft\n(s) ,\n\n(4)\n\ninc is an unknown partonic soft scattering cross section. As a first simplest model, we\nwhere \u03c3soft\nassume that the matter distributions are the same, Asoft (b) = A(b), although we relax this\ncondition later. By taking the eikonal approach seriously, we can trade the unknown soft cross\nsection for the unknown total hadronic cross section,\n\n\u03c3tot (s) = 2\n\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\n1\n\ninc\n\ninc\n\n\ufffd\n\nd2 b 1 \u2212 e\u2212 2 A(b)(\u03c3hard (s)+\u03c3soft (s)) .\n\n(5)\n\nKnowing the total cross section, for a given matter distribution and hard cross section (implied\nby pmin\nand the PDF choice) the soft cross section is then determined. In order to make pret\ndictions for energies higher than the Tevatron, we consider three predictions of the total cross\nsection: 1) the standard Donnachie\u2013Landshoff parameterization [16]; 2) the latter for the energy\ndependence but with the normalization fixed by the CDF measurement [21]; and 3) the newer\nDonnachie\u2013Landshoff model with a hard component [17]. Of course once we have an experimental measurement from the LHC we would use that for our predictions. In this way, our simple\nhard+soft model has no more free parameters than our hard model and we can tune \u03bc2 and pmin\nt .\nBefore doing this, we present the results of Ref. [15], in which we considered the theoretical\nconstraints that could be put on these parameters.\nMPI08\n\n241\n\n\fFig. 2: Multiplicity and psum\nin the transverse region. CDF data are shown as black circles, Herwig++ without MPI\nt\nas magenta dots, with MPI using MRST [19] PDFs as solid red and with CTEQ6L [20] as cyan dashed. The lower plot\nshows the statistical significance of the disagreement between the Monte Carlo predictions and the data.

These are shown for the Tevatron on the left-hand side of Fig. 3 as the solid\nlines for three different PDF sets: the two shown previously and MRST LO* [22]. Since in the\n\n242\n\nMPI08\n\n\finc\nFig. 3: Left: The parameter space of the simple eikonal model at the Tevatron. The solid curves come from \u03c3soft\n>0\n\nfor three different PDF sets. The horizontal lines come from bel = 16.98 \u00b1 0.25 GeV\u22122 [21, 23]. The excluded\nregions are shaded. The dashed lines indicate the preferred parameter ranges from the fit to Tevatron final-state\n\ndata [11]. Right: The equivalent plot for the LHC. The additional (dashed) constraints come from requiring the total\nnumber of scatters to be less than 10.\n\neikonal model the total and inelastic cross sections are related to the elastic one, we can also\nplace constraints from the elastic slope parameter, which has been measured by CDF [21, 23]:\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\nd\u03c3el\nd\nln\nbel (s) \u2261\ndt\ndt\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\n\n=\nt=0\n\n1\n\u03c3tot\n\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\nd2 b b2 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c7tot (b,s) = (17 \u00b1 0.25) GeV\u22122 . (6)\n\nThis rather precise measurement directly constrains \u03bc2 in our simple model and rules out all but\na very narrow strip of the parameter space. Finally, we consider the parameter space of the fit\nto final-state data. Although there is a preferred point in the parameter space, the tuning of both\nthe hard-only model [11] and the hard+soft model shown below indicates a strong correlation\nbetween the two parameters and there is a broad region of acceptable parameter values, which\nwe show in Fig. 3 by the region edged by red bands. Between the different constraints we have\nonly a very small allowed region of parameter space.\ninc > 0 is considerably more\nAt the LHC the picture is similar, although the constraint \u03c3soft\nrestrictive (note the difference in range of the x axes of the two plots). Different models predict bel\nin the range 19 to 22 GeV\u22122 translating into a slightly wider horizontal band. Finally, although\nwe do not have final-state data to compare to, in order to simulate self-consistent final states at\nall we find that we must prevent the multiplicity of scatters becoming too high. While precisely\nwhere we place this cut is arbitrary, we indicate it by shading the region in which the mean\nnumber of scatters is greater than 10. This plot is shown for the central of the three total LHC\ncross section predictions we consider \u2013 it is qualitatively similar for the other two, although the\ndifferent constraints move somewhat.\n\nMPI08\n\n243\n\n\fComparing the two plots in Fig. 3, we come to the realization that, from these theoretical\nconstraints together with the fit to the Tevatron data, we can already rule out the possibility that\nthe parameters of this simple model are energy-independent \u2013 there is no region of the plot that\nis allowed at both energies.\nWhile it could be that the parameters of the MPI model are in fact energy dependent, as\nadvocated by the PYTHIA authors [24], we prefer to let the LHC data decide, by proposing a\nmodel that is flexible enough to allow energy-independent or -dependent parameters. The simplest generalization of the above model that achieves this is actually well physically motivated,\nand we call it the hot-spot model.\n2.2\n\nHot-Spot model\n\nThe simple model has other shortcomings, beyond our aesthetic preference to allow the possiinc extracted from the predictions of\nbility of energy-independent parameters. The values of \u03c3soft\n\u03c3tot [15], have rather strange energy dependence, being quite sensitive to precise details of the\nmatter distribution, parameter choice, cross section prediction and PDF set and, in most cases,\nhaving a steeply rising dependence on energy, much steeper than one would like to imagine\nfor a purely soft cross section. Moreover, the value of \u03bc2 extracted from bel is in contradiction with that extracted from CDF's measurement [25] of double-parton scattering, which yields\n\u03bc2 = 3.0 \u00b1 0.5 GeV2 .\nAll of these shortcomings can be circumvented by allowing the matter distribution to be\ndifferent for soft and hard scatters. As a next simplest model, we keep the same form for each,\nbut allow the \u03bc2 values to be different. We again fix the additional free parameter, this time to a\nfixed value of bel . That is, once \u03c3tot and bel are measured at some energy, the non-perturbative\ninc and \u03bc2\nparameters of our model, \u03c3soft\nsoft are known. Since it will turn out that our preferred value\n2\nof \u03bc is significantly larger than the extracted value of \u03bc2soft , we call this a hot-spot model: soft\npartons have a relatively broad distribution, actually similar to the electromagnetic form factor,\nwhile semi-hard partons (typically still small x, but probed at momentum scales above pmin\nt ) are\nconcentrated into smaller denser regions within the proton.\nHaving used one constraint to fix an additional parameter, there is only one constraint\nin the parameter space, shown in Fig. 4 for the Tevatron and LHC. The model has much more\nfreedom than the simple one, with much of the parameter space allowed, and with ample overlap\nbetween the allowed regions at the two energies.\ninc it implies, shown in\nAnother nice feature of this model is the energy-dependence of \u03c3soft\nFig. 5. At least for the standard Donnachie\u2013Landshoff energy dependence, it corresponds to a\nvery slow increase, almost constant, in-keeping with one's expectations of a soft cross section.\n\n3\n\nFinal states\n\nWe have implemented this model into Herwig++. There are many additional details that we\ndo not go into here [6], but wherever possible, the treatment of soft scatters is kept as similar\nas possible to that of semi-hard scatters, to make for a smooth matching. In particular, for the\ntransverse momentum dependence, we make the distribution of p2t a Gaussian centred on zero,\ninc and whose width is adjusted such\nwhose integral over the range zero to pmin\nis given by \u03c3soft\nt\n244\n\nMPI08\n\n\fFig. 4: Parameter space of the improved eikonal model for the Tevatron (left) and LHC (right). The solid curves\nimpose a minimum allowed value of \u03bc2 , for a given value of pmin\nby requiring a valid description of \u03c3tot and bel with\nt\ninc\npositive \u03c3soft\n. The excluded regions are shaded. We used the MRST 2001 LO [19] PDFs for these plots.\n\nmin is therefore seen to be not a cutoff, as it is in the Jimmy\nthat d\u03c3/dpt is continuous at pmin\nt . pt\nmodel, but a matching scale, where the model makes a relatively smooth transition between\nperturbative and non-perturbative treatments of the same phenomena, in a similar spirit to the\nmodel of Ref. [26] for transverse momentum in initial-state radiation.\n\nThe model actually exhibits a curious feature in its pt dependence, first observed in Ref. [12].\ninc\nWith the typical parameter values that are preferred by the data, d\u03c3/dpt is large enough, and \u03c3soft\nsmall enough, that the soft distribution is not actually a Gaussian but an inverted Gaussian: its\nwidth-squared parameter is negative. The result is that the transverse momentum of scatters is\ndominated by the region around pmin\nand not by the truly non-perturbative region pt \u2192 0. This\nt\nadds to the self-consistency of the model, justifying the use of an independent partonic scattering\npicture even for soft non-perturbative collisions.\nWith the model in hand, we can repeat the tune to the CDF data on the underlying event.\nUnlike with the semi-hard model, we now fit the data right down to zero leading jet momentum.\nThe result is shown in Fig. 6, which is qualitatively similar to the one for the semi-hard model.\nThe description of the data in the transverse region is shown in Fig. 7. It can be seen to be\nreasonable in the lower transverse momentum region, although certainly still not as good as at\nhigher transverse momenta.\nThe discrepancy in the lowest few bins may be related to another deficiency of our model.\nAccording to the eikonal model, the inelastic cross section should include all final states that\nare not exactly elastic, while our simulation of them generates only non-diffractive events in\nwhich colour is exchanged between the two protons and hence a significant number of finalstate hadrons are produced. While single-diffractive-dissociation events would not be triggered\non experimentally, double-diffractive-dissociation events, in which both protons break up but do\nMPI08\n\n245\n\n\finc\nFig. 5: \u03c3soft\nas a function of energy.

In Ref. [6] we have checked that these bins are not pulling our tune significantly by\nrepeating it without them. The overall chi-squared is significantly smaller, but the best fit point\nand chi-squared contours are similar.\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have reviewed the basis of the semi-hard MPI model that we previously implemented in\nHerwig++, and motivated its extension to a soft component. Through the connection with the\ntotal and elastic cross sections provided by the eikonal model and optical theorem, we have\nplaced significant constraints on the simplest soft model. We have shown that these constraints\ncan be relaxed by invoking a hot-spot model in which the spatial distributions of soft and semihard partons are different. Finally, we have implemented this model and shown that it gives a\nreasonable description of the minimum bias data, for the first time in Herwig++. Nevertheless,\nthere is still room for improvement, particularly in the very low pt region and several avenues for\nfurther study present themselves, not least the diffractive component already mentioned, and the\nrole of colour correlations, which were argued to be very important in Ref. [14], but which seem\nto be less so in the current Herwig++ implementation [6].\nDespite the successful description of Tevatron data, the extrapolation to the LHC suffers\nfrom considerable uncertainty.

Finally, even once the underlying event data have\nbeen measured, the parameters will not be fully tied down, due to their entanglement with the\nPDFs. We eagerly await the LHC data to guide us.\n\nMPI08\n\n247\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to the other Herwig++ authors and Leif L\u00f6nnblad for extensive collaboration.\nMB and JMB gratefully acknowledge the organizers of the First Workshop on Multiple Parton\nInteractions at the LHC for a stimulating and productive meeting.

A brief overview of the current P YTHIA 8 multiple\ninteractions (MI) model is given, before looking at two additional effects which can be included in the MI framework. With rescattering,\na previously scattered parton is allowed to take part in another subsequent scattering, while with enhanced screening, the effects of varying\ninitial-state fluctuations are modelled.\n1 Introduction\nThe run-up to the start of the LHC has led to a greatly increased interest in the physics of multiple\nparton interactions in hadronic collisions. Existing models are used to try to get an insight into\nwhat can be expected at new experiments, extrapolating fits to Tevatron and other data to LHC\nenergies [1]. Such extrapolations, however, come with a high level of uncertainty; within many\nmodels are parameters which scale with an uncertain energy dependence. There is, therefore,\nalso the exciting prospect of new data, with which to further constrain and improve models.\nIn terms of theoretical understanding, MI is one of the least well understood areas. While\ncurrent models, after tuning, are able to describe many distributions very well, there are still\nmany others which are not fully described. This is a clear sign that new physical effects need to\nbe modelled and it is therefore not enough to \"sit still\" while waiting for new data. It is with this\nin mind that we look at two new ideas in the context of MI and their potential effects.\nWith rescattering, an already scattered parton is able to undergo another subsequent scattering. Although, in general, such rescatterings may be relatively soft, even when compared\nto normal 2 \u2192 2 MI scatterings, they can lead to non-trivial colour flows which change the\nstructure of events. Another idea is to consider partonic fluctuations in the incoming hadrons\nbefore collision. In such a picture, it is possible to get varying amounts of colour screening on an\nevent-by-event basis. The question then is, what effects such new ideas would have on multiple\ninteractions and how can they be included in the P YTHIA framework?\nIn Section 2, a brief introduction to the existing MI model in P YTHIA 8 is given. For more\ncomprehensive details about what is contained in the model, readers are directed to [2] and the\nreferences therein. In Sections 3 and 4, an initial look at rescattering and enhanced screening is\ngiven. A summary and outlook is given in Section 5.\n\u2020\n\nspeaker; richard.corke@thep.lu.se; work done in collaboration with T. Sj\u00f6strand (torbjorn@thep.lu.se) and in\npart with F.

It is an evolution of\nthe model introduced in P YTHIA 6.3 [2], which in turn is based on the model developed in\nearlier versions of P YTHIA. The earliest model [4] was built around the virtuality-ordered parton\nshowers available at the time and introduced many key features which are still present in the later\nmodels, such as p\u22a5 ordering, perturbative QCD cross sections dampened at small p\u22a5 , a variable\nimpact parameter, PDF rescaling, and colour reconnection.\nThe next-generation model [5, 6] was developed after the introduction of transverse-momentum-ordered showers, opening the way to have a common p\u22a5 evolution scale for initial-state\nradiation (ISR), final-state radiation (FSR) and MI emissions. The second key ingredient was the\naddition of junction fragmentation to the Lund String hadronisation model, allowing the handling\nof arbitrarily complicated beam remnants. This permitted the MI framework to be updated to\ninclude a more complete set of QCD 2 \u2192 2 processes, with the inclusion of flavour effects in the\nPDF rescaling.\nThe P YTHIA 8 MI framework also contains additional new features which are not found\nin previous versions, such as\n\u2022 a richer mix of underlying-event processes (\u03b3, J/\u03c8, Drell-Yan, etc.),\n\u2022 the possibility to select two hard interactions in the same event, and\n\u2022 the possibility to use one PDF set for hard processes and another for other subsequent\ninteractions.\n2.1 Interleaved p\u22a5 Ordering\n\nStarting in P YTHIA 6.3, ISR and MI were interleaved with a common p\u22a5 evolution scale. In\nP YTHIA 8, this is taken a step further, with FSR now also fully interleaved. The overall probability for the ith interaction or shower branching to take place at p\u22a5 = p\u22a5 i is given by\ndP\ndp\u22a5\n\n=\n\n\ufffd\n\ndPMI \ufffd dPISR \ufffd dPFSR\n+\n+\ndp\u22a5\ndp\u22a5\ndp\u22a5\n\ufffd\n\n\u00d7 exp \u2212\n\n\ufffd\n\np\u22a5i\u22121\n\np\u22a5\n\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\ndPMI \ufffd dPISR \ufffd dPFSR\n+\n+\ndp\ufffd\u22a5\ndp\ufffd\u22a5\ndp\ufffd\u22a5\n\n\ufffd\n\ndp\ufffd\u22a5\n\n\ufffd\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwith contributions from MI, ISR and FSR unitarised by a Sudakov-like exponential factor.\nIf we now focus on just the MI contribution, the probability for an interaction is given by\n\ufffd\n\ndP\n1 d\u03c3\n=\nexp \u2212\ndp\u22a5 i\n\u03c3nd dp\u22a5\n\n\ufffd\n\np\u22a5i\u22121\n\np\u22a5\n\n\ufffd\n\n1 d\u03c3 \ufffd\ndp\n,\n\u03c3nd dp\ufffd\u22a5 \u22a5\n\n(2)\n\nwhere d\u03c3/dp\u22a5 is given by the perturbative QCD 2 \u2192 2 cross section. This cross section is dominated by t-channel gluon exchange, and diverges roughly as dp2\u22a5 /p4\u22a5 . To avoid this divergence,\nthe idea of colour screening is introduced. The concept of a perturbative cross section is based\non the assumption of free incoming states, which is not the case when partons are confined in\ncolour-singlet hadrons. One therefore expects a colour charge to be screened by the presence\nof nearby anti-charges; that is, if the typical charge separation is d, gluons with a transverse\n250\n\nMPI08\n\n\fwavelength \u223c 1/p\u22a5 > d are no longer able to resolve charges individually, leading to a reduced\neffective coupling. This is introduced by reweighting the interaction cross section such that it is\nregularised according to\n\u03b12S (p2\u22a50 + p2\u22a5 )\nd\u03c3\u0302\n\u03b12S (p2\u22a5 )\n\u221d\n\u2192\n,\n(3)\ndp2\u22a5\np4\u22a5\n(p2\u22a5 0 + p2\u22a5 )2\nwhere p\u22a5 0 (related to 1/d above) is now a free parameter in the model.\n\n2.2 Impact Parameter\nUp to this point, all parton-parton interactions have been assumed to be independent, such that\nthe probability to have n interactions in an event, Pn , is given by Poissonian statistics. This\npicture is now changed, first by requiring that there is at least one interaction, such that we have\na physical event, and second by including an impact parameter, b. The default matter distribution\nin P YTHIA is a double Gaussian\n\ufffd\n\n1\u2212\u03b2\nr2\nexp\n\u2212\n\u03c1(r) \u221d\na31\na21\n\n\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\n\u03b2\nr2\n+ 3 exp \u2212 2\na2\na2\n\n\ufffd\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nsuch that a fraction \u03b2 of the matter is contained in a radius a2 , which in turn is embedded in a\nradius a1 containing the rest of the matter. The time-integrated overlap of the incoming hadrons\nduring collision is given by\nO(b) =\n\n\ufffd\n\ndt\n\n\ufffd\n\nd3 x \u03c1(x, y, z) \u03c1(x + b, y, z + t),\n\n(5)\n\nafter a suitable scale transformation to compensate for the boosted nature of the incoming hadrons.\nSuch an impact parameter picture has central collisions being generally more active, with\nan average activity at a given impact parameter being proportional to the overlap, O(b). While\nrequiring at least one interaction results in Pn being narrower than Poissonian, when the impact\nparameter dependence is added, the overall effect is that Pn is broader than Poissonian. The\naddition of an impact parameter also leads to a good description of the \"Pedestal Effect\", where\nevents with a hard scale have a tendency to have more underlying activity; this is as central\ncollisions have a higher chance both of a hard interaction and of more underlying activity. This\ncentrality effect naturally saturates at p\u22a5 hard \u223c 10GeV.\n2.3 PDF Rescaling\nIn the original model, PDFs were rescaled only such that overall momentum was conserved. This\nwas done by evaluating PDFs at a modified x value\nx\ufffdi =\n\nxi\n\n1\u2212\n\n\ufffdi\u22121\n\nj=1 xj\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the subscript i refers to the current interaction and the sum runs over all previous interactions. The original model was affected by a technical limitation in fragmentation; it was only\npossible to take one valence quark from an incoming hadron. This meant that the MI framework\nMPI08\n\n251\n\n\fwas limited to qq and gg final states and that it was not possible to have ISR from secondary\nscatterings. By introducing junction fragmentation, where a central junction is connected to\nthree quarks and carries baryon number, these limitations were removed. This allowed the nextgeneration model to include a more complete set of MI processes and flavour effects in PDF\nrescaling.\nISR, FSR and MI can all lead to changes in the incoming PDFs. In the case of FSR, a\ncolour dipole can stretch from a radiating parton to a beam remnant, leading to (a modest amount\nof) momentum shuffling between the beam and the parton. Both ISR and MI can result in large x\nvalues being taken from the beams, as well as leading to flavour changes in the PDFs. If a valence\nquark is taken from one of the incoming hadrons, the valence PDF is rescaled to the remaining\nnumber. If, instead, a sea quark (qs ) is taken from a hadron, an anti-sea companion quark (qc )\nis left behind. The x distribution for this companion quark is generated from a perturbative\nansatz, where the sea/anti-sea quarks are assumed to have come from a gluon splitting, g \u2192 qs qc .\nSubsequent perturbative evolution of the qc distribution is neglected. Finally, there is the issue of\noverall momentum conservation. If a valence quark is removed from a PDF, momentum must be\nput back in, while if a companion quark is added, momentum must be taken from the PDF. This\nis done by allowing the normalisation of the sea and gluon PDFs to fluctuate such that overall\nmomentum is conserved.\n2.4 Beam Remnants, Primordial k\u22a5 and Colour Reconnection\n\nWhen the p\u22a5 evolution has come to an end, the beam remnant will consist of the remaining\nvalence content of the incoming hadrons as well as any companion quarks. These remnants\nmust carry the remaining fraction of longitudinal momentum. P YTHIA will pick x values for\neach component of the beam remnants, according to distributions such that the valence content is\n\"harder\" and will carry away more momentum. In the rare case that there is no remaining quark\ncontent in a beam, a gluon is assigned to take all the remaining momentum.\nThe event is then modified to add primordial k\u22a5 . Partons are expected to have a non-zero\nk\u22a5 value just from Fermi motion within the incoming hadrons. A rough estimate based on the\nsize of the proton gives a value of \u223c 0.3 GeV, but when comparing to data, for instance the p\u22a5\ndistribution of Z0 at CDF, a value of \u223c 2 GeV appears to be needed. The current solution is to\ndecide a k\u22a5 value for each initiator parton taken from a hadron based on a Gaussian whose width\nis generated according to an interpolation\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03c3(Q) = max \uf8ed\u03c3min , \u03c3\u221e\n\n\uf8f6\n\n1\n\uf8f8,\n1 + Q 1 /Q\n\n(7)\n\n2\n\nwhere Q is the hardness of a sub-collision, \u03c3min is a minimal value (\u223c 0.3 GeV), \u03c3\u221e is a\nmaximal value that is approached asymptotically and Q 1 is the Q value at which \u03c3(Q) is equal\n2\nto half \u03c3\u221e . The recoil is shared among all initiator and remnant partons from the incoming\nhadrons, and the k\u22a5 given to all daughter partons through a Lorentz boost.\n\nThe final step is colour reconnection. In the old MI framework, Rick Field found a good\nagreement to CDF data if 90% of additional interactions produced two gluons with \"nearest\n252\n\nMPI08\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 1: (a) Two 2 \u2192 2 scatterings, (b) a 2 \u2192 2 scattering followed by a rescattering\n\nneighbour\" colour connections [9]. In P YTHIA 8, with its more general MI framework, colour\nreconnection is performed by giving each system a probability to reconnect with a harder system\nP=\n\np\u22a5 2Rec\n,\n2\n(p\u22a5 Rec + p2\u22a5 )\n\np\u22a5 Rec = RR \u2217 p\u22a5 0 ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere RR, ReconnectRange, is a user-tunable parameter and p\u22a5 0 is the same parameter as in\neq. (3). The idea of colour reconnection can be motivated by noting that MI leads to many\ncolour strings that will overlap in physical space. Moving from the limit of NC \u2192 \u221e to NC =\n3, it is perhaps not unreasonable to consider these strings to be connected differently due to a\ncoincidence of colour, so as to reduce the total string length and thereby the potential energy.\nWith the above probability for reconnection, it is easier to reconnect low p\u22a5 systems, which can\nbe viewed as them having a larger spatial extent such that they are more likely to overlap with\nother colour strings. Currently, however, given the lack of a firm theoretical basis, the need for\ncolour reconnection has only been established within the context of specific models.\n3 Rescattering\nA process with a rescattering occurs when an outgoing state from one scattering is allowed to become the incoming state in another scattering. This is illustrated schematically in Figure 1, where\n(a) shows two independent 2 \u2192 2 processes while (b) shows a rescattering process. An estimate\nfor the size of such rescattering effects is given by Paver and Treleani [7], where a factorised\nform is used for the double parton distribution, giving the probability of finding two partons of\ngiven x values inside an incoming hadron. Their results show that, at Tevatron energies, rescattering is expected to be a small effect when compared against the more dominant case of multiple\ndisconnected scatterings.\nIf we accept MI as real, however, then we should also allow rescatterings to take place.\nThey would show up in the collective effects of MI, manifesting themselves as changes to multiplicity, p\u22a5 and other distributions. After a retuning of p\u22a5 0 and other model parameters, it is\nlikely that their impact is significantly reduced, so we should therefore ask whether there are\nmore direct ways in which rescattering may show up. Is there perhaps a region of low p\u22a5 jets,\nMPI08\n\n253\n\n\fScatterings\nSingle rescatterings\nDouble rescatterings\n\nTevatron\nMin Bias QCD Jets\n2.81\n5.11\n0.37\n1.20\n0.01\n0.03\n\nLHC\nMin Bias QCD Jets\n5.21\n12.20\n0.93\n3.64\n0.02\n0.11\n\nTable 1: Average number of scatterings, single rescatterings and double rescatterings in minimum bias and QCD jet\n\u221a\n\u221a\nevents at Tevatron ( s = 1.96 GeV, QCD jet p\u0302\u22a5min = 20 GeV) and LHC ( s = 14.0 TeV, QCD jet p\u0302\u22a5min =\n50GeV) energies\n\nwhere an event is not dominated by ISR/FSR, where this extra source of three-jet topologies will\nbe visible? A further consideration is that such rescatterings will generate more p\u22a5 in the perturbative region, which may overall mean it is possible to reduce the amount of primordial k\u22a5 and\ncolour reconnections necessary to match data, as discussed in Section 2.4.\n3.1 Rescattering in P YTHIA 8\nIf we begin with the typical case of small-angle t-channel gluon scattering, we can imagine that\na combination of a scattered parton and a hadron remnant will closely match one of the incoming\nhadrons. In such a picture, we can write the complete PDF for a hadron as\nf (x, Q2 ) \u2192 frescaled(x, Q2 ) +\n\n\ufffd\nn\n\n\u03b4(x \u2212 xn ) = fu (x, Q2 ) + f\u03b4 (x, Q2 ),\n\n(9)\n\nwhere the subscript u/\u03b4 is the unscattered/scattered component. That is, each time a scattering occurs, one parton is fixed to a specific xn value, while the remainder is still a continuous\nprobability distribution. In such a picture, the momentum sum should still approximately obey\n\ufffd\n\n0\n\n1\n\n\ufffd\n\nx frescaled(x, Q ) +\n2\n\n\ufffd\nn\n\n\ufffd\n\n\u03b4(x \u2212 xn ) dx = 1.\n\n(10)\n\nOf course, in general, it is not possible to uniquely identify a scattered parton with one\nhadron, so an approximate prescription must be used instead, such as rapidity based. If we\nconsider the original MI probability given in eqs. (1) and (2), we can now generalise this to\ninclude the effects of rescattering\ndPuu dPu\u03b4\ndP\u03b4u dP\u03b4\u03b4\ndPMI\n\u2192\n+\n+\n+\n,\ndp\u22a5\ndp\u22a5\ndp\u22a5\ndp\u22a5\ndp\u22a5\n\n(11)\n\nwhere the uu component now represents the original MI probability, the u\u03b4 and \u03b4u components\na single rescattering and the \u03b4\u03b4 component a double rescattering, where both incoming states to\nan interaction are previously scattered partons.\nSome indicative numbers are given in Table 1, which shows the average number of scatterings and rescatterings for different types of event at Tevatron and LHC energies. The average\ndistribution of such scatterings per event is also shown in Figure 2 for Tevatron minimum bias\n254\n\nMPI08\n\n\fNormal\nSingle Rescatter\n\n1.6\n\ndN/d(log p2\u22a5)\n\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\nSingle Rescatter / Normal\nDouble Rescatter / Normal\n\nRatio\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\nlog10(p2\u22a5)\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n\u221a\nFig. 2: Average distribution of scatterings, single rescatterings and double rescatterings per event ( s = 1.96 GeV,\nminimum bias). Double rescattering is not visible at this scale in the dN/d(log p2\u22a5 ) plot, but is visible in the ratio\n\nevents. In the upper plot of dN/d(log p2\u22a5 ), the suppression of the cross section at small p2\u22a5 is\ncaused mainly by the regularisation outlined in eq. (3), but is also affected by the scaling violation in the PDFs. Below p2\u22a5 \u223c 1 GeV2 , the PDFs are frozen, giving rise to an abrupt change in\nslope. Normal scatterings dominate, but there is a clear contribution from single rescatterings.\nIn the upper plot, it is not possible to see the effects of double rescattering, but this is (barely)\nvisible in the ratio plot below. Given the overall small contribution from double rescatterings,\nwe neglect these in the following. As previously predicted, rescattering is a small effect at larger\np\u22a5 scales, but, when evolving downwards, its relative importance grows as more and more partons are scattered out of the incoming hadrons and become available to rescatter. Note that here,\nwe classify the original scattering and the rescattering by p\u22a5 , but make no claims on the time\nordering of the two.\n3.2 Mean p\u22a5 vs Charged Multiplicity\n\nWhile a preliminary framework is in place which allows for hadronic final states, there are nontrivial recoil kinematics when considering the combination of rescattering, FSR and primordial\nk\u22a5 . With the dipole-style recoil used in the parton showers, a final-state radiating parton will\nusually shuffle momenta with its nearest colour neighbour. Without rescattering, colour dipoles\nare not spanned between systems, and individual systems will locally conserve momentum. With\nrescattering enabled, you instead have the possibility of colour dipoles spanning different scattering systems and therefore the possibility of an individual system no longer locally conserving\nMPI08\n\n255\n\n\fCDF Run II\nPYTHIA 6.418, Tune A\nPYTHIA 8.114, Default\nPYTHIA 8.114, Deferred FSR\nPYTHIA 8.114, No Reconnection\nPYTHIA 8.114, Deferred FSR, No Reconnection\n\n1.3\n1.2\n\n<pT> [GeV/c]\n\n1.1\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n15\n20\n25\nCharged particle multiplicity\n\n30\n\n35\n\nFig. 3: Mean p\u22a5 vs Charged Multiplicity, |\u03b7| \u2264 1 and p\u22a5 \u2265 0.4 GeV/c, CDF Run II data against Pythia 6.418 (Tune\nA) and Pythia 8.114 (default settings) with and without deferred FSR\n\nmomentum. When primordial k\u22a5 is now added through a Lorentz boost, these local momentum\nimbalances can lead to global momentum non-conservation. In order to proceed and be able to\ntake an initial look at the effects of rescattering on colour reconnection, a temporary solution of\ndeferring FSR until after primordial k\u22a5 is added has been used, as is done in P YTHIA 6.4.\n\nWe begin by studying the mean p\u22a5 vs charged multiplicity distribution, \ufffdp\u22a5 \ufffd(nch ), from\nP YTHIA 6.418 (Tune A) and P YTHIA 8.114 (default settings), compared to the CDF Run II data\n(|\u03b7| \u2264 1 and p\u22a5 \u2265 0.4 GeV/c) [10]. For each run, the p\u22a5 0 parameter of the MI framework is\ntuned so that the mean number of charged particles in the central region is maintained at the Tune\nA value. This is shown in Figure 3, where we can see that P YTHIA 6, using virtuality-ordered\nshowers and the old MI framework, does a reasonable job of describing the data. P YTHIA 8 does\nnot currently have a full tune to data, but does qualitatively reproduce the shape of the data when\ncolour reconnection is turned on, up to an overall normalisation shift. It is clear that without\ncolour reconnection, the slope of the curve is much too shallow and unlikely to describe the data,\neven given an overall shift. The same results with deferred FSR are also shown; the slope is\nmarginally steeper, but still in the same region as without deferred FSR.\nFigure 4 now shows the results when rescattering is enabled. Starting without any colour\nreconnection, we see that when rescattering is turned on, there is a rise in the mean p\u22a5 , but also\nthat this is in no way a large gain.

Now, when the full generation framework is almost there, it is clear\nthat rescattering is not the answer to the colour reconnection problem. Other potential effects of\nrescattering remain to be studied.\n4 Enhanced Screening\nThe idea of enhanced screening came from the modelling of initial states using dipoles in transverse space [11]. A model using an extended Mueller dipole formalism has recently been used\nto describe the total and diffractive cross sections in pp and \u03b3 \u2217 p collisions and the elastic cross\nsection in pp scattering [8]. In such a picture, initial-state dipoles are evolved forwards in rapidity, before two such incoming states are collided. In the model, as the evolution proceeds, the\nnumber of dipoles with small transverse extent grows faster than that of large dipoles. The dipole\nsize, r, determines the screening length, which appears in the interaction cross section as a p\u22a5\ncutoff, p\u22a5 0 \u223c 1/r. Smaller dipoles imply a larger effective cutoff, and an enhanced amount of\nscreening. A rough calculation shows that this screening effect is expected to grow as the square\nroot of the number of dipoles.\nTo model this in P YTHIA, we consider the p\u22a5 0 parameter of the MI framework that encapsulates colour screening, as given in eq. (3). By scaling this value by an amount that grows as\nthe amount of initial-state activity grows, this enhanced screening effect can be mimicked.

With the first scenario, ES1, n is\nset equal to the number of multiple interactions that have taken place in an event (including the\ncurrent one). In the second, ES2, n is set equal to the number of MI+ISR interactions that have\ntaken place in an event.\n4.1 Mean p\u22a5 vs Charged Multiplicity\n\nWe again study the \ufffdp\u22a5 \ufffd(nch ) distribution, this time with the enhanced screening ansatz. The results are given in Figure 5. Looking at the curves without colour reconnection, it is immediately\napparent that both scenarios give a dramatic rise in the mean p\u22a5 , although not quite enough to\nexplain data on their own. With colour reconnection now enabled and tuned, again so that the\ncurves qualitatively match the shape of the Run II data, it is possible to noticeably reduce the\namount of reconnection needed. With colour reconnection at these levels, there is still perhaps\nan uncomfortably large number of systems being reconnected, but the results are definitely encouraging. There are many more areas to study in relation to enhanced screening, but from these\ninitial results, it is worth checking if it may play a role in reducing colour reconnections to a more\ncomfortable level.\n258\n\nMPI08\n\n\f5 Conclusions\nP YTHIA 8, the C++ rewrite of the P YTHIA event generator has now been released. It has been\nwritten with a focus on Tevatron and LHC applications, something that is evident given the sophisticated MI model present in the program. The original MI model, introduced in the early versions of P YTHIA, has been well proven when compared to experimental data. The new P YTHIA\n8 MI framework, based on this original model, now generalises the physics processes available,\nas well as adding entirely new features.\nWe have also taken an early look at rescattering and enhanced screening, two new ideas\nfor modifying the physics inside the MI framework. There is currently a preliminary framework\nfor rescattering, although fully interleaved ISR, FSR and MI is still to come. It appears, at this\nearly stage, that rescattering is not the answer to the colour reconnection problem, but there is\nstill much more to investigate, such as three-jet multiplicities and other collective effects. The\nidea of enhanced screening leads to a simple ansatz that gives large changes when looking at\nthe \ufffdp\u22a5 \ufffd(nch ) distribution. Again, there are still many questions to be asked, including how this\nmodification affects other distributions.\nReferences\n[1] Field, R.

Porteboeuf(a)\n(a) SUBATECH, University of Nantes \u2013 IN2P3/CNRS\u2013 EMN, Nantes, France\n(b) Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Institut fuer Kernphysik, Karlsruhe, Germany\nAbstract\nWe discuss the multiple scattering approach in EPOS and its consequences in particular for proton-proton scattering at the LHC.\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt has been known since a long time that very high energy hadrons experience multiple scatterings when they hit protons or neutrons. Concerning inclusive cross sections, the situation\nbecomes quite simple due to the fact that different multiple scattering contributions cancel due\nto destructive interference (AGK cancellations). The corresponding formulas are simple and can\nbe expressed in terms of parton distributions functions, based on evolutions equations (DGLAP,\nBFKL, BK).\nTo get more detailed information, one needs partial cross sections, since individual hadronic\ninteractions are of a particular multiple scattering type (single, or double, or triple...) and contribute differently to certain observables. Even if the inclusive cross sections were perfectly\nknown, one still would need addition information concerning the treatment of multiple scattering. Here, Gribov-Regge theory provides a solution, in particular when energy sharing is properly\ntaken into accound, as in the EPOS approach.\nAn important issue is the concept of remnants, based on the hypothesis that in a hadronhadron collision there are three sources of particle production: (1) hadrons from partons which\nare due to the parton evolution, (2) hadrons from projectile remant excitations, and (3) hadrons\nfrom target remnants. Remnants are meant to be the spectator partons from the incident hadrons,\nrepresenting hadron excitations. In the language of cut diagrams such contributions must exist.\nThere is not much guidance from theory, how to define a \"remnant model\". However, we expect\nthe remants to be rather energy independent, so one may rely on the wealth of data at relatively\n\u221a\nlow energies ( s \u2248 20 \u2212 1800GeV) to test the model assumptions.\n\nConcerning the partons from the parton evolution (source (1) in the previous paragraph),\nwe expect that low momentum fraction (low x) partons do not simply evolve following linear\nevolution equations (like DGLAP or BFKL). There are nonlinear effect becoming more and\nmore important (with decreasing x and increasing nuclear mass number in case of collisions\nwith nuclei), finally leading to saturation. Apart of the theoretical reasoning discussed earlier,\none needs such \"nonlinear effects\" to tame the hadron-hadron cross sections at very high energies\n(which would otherwise \"explode\"). So any realistic model needs to deal with saturation, in a\nmore or less sophisticated way.\nFinally, if one wants to make precise predictions concerning the hadron chemistry, a crucial\ningredient is the fragmentation procedure. Concerning the low transverse momentum hadrons\n(representing the overwhelming majority of all particles), the preferred procedure is the string\n260\n\nMPI08\n\n\fapproach. Using fragmentation functions is certainly a useful concept for jet fragmentation, but\nnot necessarily for soft particle production.\n2\n\nParton evolution in EPOS\n\nAn elementary scattering in EPOS [1] is given by a so-called \"parton ladder\", see fig. 1, representing\n\nnucleon\n\nquasi longitudinal\ncolor electric field\nnonlinear effects\n(screening)\n\n\"flux tube\"\ngluons =\ntransverse\nkinks\n\nnucleon\n\ndecay\nvia pair\nproduction\n\nFig. 1: Elementary interaction in the EPOS model.\n\nparton evolutions from the projectile and the target side towards the center (small x). The evolution is gouverned by an evolution equation, in the simplest case according to DGLAP. In the\nfollowing we will refer to these partons as \"ladder partons\", to be distinguished from \"spectator\npartons\" to be discussed later. It has been realized more than 20 years ago that such a parton\nladder may be considered as a longitudinal color field, conveniently treated as a relativistic string\nwhen it comes to hadronization. The intermediate gluons are treated as kink singularities in the\nlanguage of relativistic strings. A string decays via the production of quark-antiquark pairs, creating in this way string fragments \u2013 which are identified with hadrons. Such a picture is also in\nqualitative agreement with recent developments concerning the CGC.\nImportant in particular at moderate energies (RHIC): our \"parton ladder\" is meant to contain two parts [2]: the hard one, as discussed above (following an evolution equation), and a soft\none, which is a purely phenomenological object, parametrized in Regge pole fashion. The soft\npart essentially compensates for the infrared cutoffs, which have to be employed in the perturbative calculations.\nAs discussed earlier, at high energies one needs to worry about non-linear effects, due to\nthe fact that the gluon densities get so high that gluon fusion becomes important. In our language\nMPI08\n\n261\n\n\fthis means that two partons ladders fuse (or split, if we look from inside to outside [1]). Nonlinear\neffects could be taken into account by using BK instead of DGLAP evolution. What we try to\nrealize here is a phenomenological approach, which (hopefully) grasps the main features of these\nnon-linear phenomena, and still remains technically doable (we should nor forget that we finally\nhave to generalize the treatment in order to take into accound multiple scatterings, as discussed\nearlier).\nOur phenomenological treatment is based on the fact that there are two types of nonlinear\neffects: a simple elastic rescattering of a ladder parton on a projectile or target nucleon (elastic\nladder splitting), or an inelastic rescattering (inelastic ladder splitting), see fig. 2. The elastic\nprocess provides screening, therefore a reduction of total and inelastic cross sections. The importance of this effect should first increase with mass number (in case of nuclei being involved),\nbut finally saturate. The inelastic process will affect particle production, in particular transverse\nmomentum spectra, strange over nonstrange particle ratios, etc. Both, elastic and inelastic rescattering must be taken into account in order to obtain a realistic picture.\n\nnucleons\n\nnucleons\n\nladder partons\n\nladder partons\n\nFig. 2: Elastic (left) and inelastic (right) \"rescattering\" of a ladder parton. We refer to (elastic and inelastic) parton\nladder splitting.\n\nTo include the effects of elastic rescattering, we first parameterize a parton ladder (to be\nmore precise: the imaginary part of the corresponding amplitude in impact parameter space)\ncomputed on the basis of DGLAP. We obtain an excellent fit of the form \u03b1(x+ x\u2212 )\u03b2 , where\nx+ and x\u2212 are the momentum fractions of the \"first\" ladder partons on respectively projectile\nand target side (which initiate the parton evolutions). The parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 depend on the\n\u221a\ncms energy s of the hadron-hadron collision. To mimick the reduction of the increase of the\nexpressions \u03b1(x+ x\u2212 )\u03b2 with enegy, we simply replace them by \u03b1(x+ )\u03b2+\u03b5P (x\u2212 )\u03b2+\u03b5T , where the\nvalues of the positive numbers \u03b5P/T will increase with the nuclear mass number and log s.\nThe inelastic rescatterings (ladder splittings, looking from insider to outside) amount to\nproviding several ladders close to projectile (or target) side, which are close to each other in\nspace. They cannot be consider as independend color fields (strings), we should rather think of\na common color field built from several partons ladders. In the string language one used the\nterm \"string fusion\", where the fused string is still an one-dimensional longitudinal object, but\nwith a modified string tension \u03ba. Also this string tension is expected to increase with the nuclear\nmass number and log s (for more details see [1]). This affects hadronization, since the flavor\ndependence of q \u2212 q\u0304 string breaking is given by the probabilities exp(\u2212\u03c0m2q /\u03ba), with mq being\n262\n\nMPI08\n\n\fthe quark masses. Also mean transverse momenta are affected, since they are proportional to\n\u221a\n\u03ba.\n3\n\nRemnants in EPOS\n\nStill the picture is not complete, since so far we just considered two interacting partons, one\nfrom the projectile and one from the target. These partons leave behind a projectile and target\nremnant, colored, so it is more complicated than simply projectile/target deceleration. One may\nsimply consider the remnants to be diquarks, providing a string end, but this simple picture seems\nto be excluded from strange antibaryon results at the SPS [3]. We therefore adopt the following\npicture: not only a quark, but a two-fold object takes directly part in the interaction, namely a\nquark-antiquark or a quark-diquark pair, leaving behind a colorless remnant, which is, however,\nin general excited (off-shell). If the first ladder parton is a gluon or a seaquark, we assume that\nthere is an intermediate object between this gluon and the projectile (target), referred to as soft\nPomeron. And the \"initiator\" of the latter on is again the above-mentionned two-fold object.\nSo we have finally three \"objects\", all of them being white: the two off-shell remnants,\nand the parton ladder in between. Whereas the remnants contribute mainly to particle production\nin the fragmentation regions, the ladders contribute preferentially at central rapidities.\nWe showed in ref. [4] that this \"three object picture\" can solve the \"multi-strange baryon\nproblem\" of ref. [3]. In addition, we assembled all available data on particle production in pp\nand pA collisions between 100 GeV (lab) up to Tevatron, in order to test our approach. Large\nrapidity (fragmentation region) data are mainly accessible at lower energies, but we believe that\nthe remnant properties do not change much with energy, apart of the fact that projectile and target\nfragmentation regions are more or less separated in rapidity. But even at RHIC, there are remnant\ncontribution at rapidity zero, for example the baryon/antibaryon ratios are significantly different\nfrom unity, in agreement with our remnant implementation. So even central rapidity RHIC data\nallow to confirm out remnant picture.\n4\n\nFactorization and Multiple Scattering\n\nAn inclusive cross section is one of the simplest quantities to characterize particle production.\nOften one need much more information, for example when trigger conditions play a role. Also\nin case of shower simulations one needs information about exclusive cross sections (the widely\nused pQCD generators are not event generators in this sense, they are generators of inclusive\nspectra, and a Monte Carlo event is not a physical event). As discussed earlier, inclusive cross\nsection are particulary simple, quantum interference helps to provide simple formulas referred to\na \"factorization\". Although factorization is widely used, strict mathematical profs exist only in\nvery special cases, and certainly not for hadron production in pp scattering.\nTo go beyond factorization and to formulate a consistent multiple scattering theory is difficult. A possible solution is Gribov's Pomeron calculus, which can be adapted to our language by\nidentifying Pomeron and parton ladder. Multiple scattering means that one has contributions with\nseveral parton ladders in parallel. This formulation is equivalent to using the eikonal formula to\nobtain total cross sections from the knowledge of the inclusive one.\nWe indicated several years ago inconsistencies in this approach, proposing an \"energy\nMPI08\n\n263\n\n\fconserving multiple scattering treatment\" [2]. The main idea is simple: in case of multiple\nscattering, when it comes to calculating partial cross sections for double, triple ... scattering, one\nhas to explicitly care about the fact that the total energy has to be shared among the individual\nelementary interactions. In other words, the partons ladders which happen to be parallel to each\n\nFig. 3: Multiple scattering with energy sharing.\n\nother share the collision energy, see fig. 3.\nA consistent quantum mechanical formulation of the multiple scattering requires not only\nthe consideration of the usual (open) parton ladders, discussed so far, but also of closed ladders,\nrepresenting elastic scattering. These are the same closed ladders which we introduced earlier in\nconnection with elastic rescatterings. The closed ladders do not contribute to particle production,\nbut they are crucial since they affect substantially the calculations of partial cross sections. Actually, the closed ladders simply lead to large numbers of interfering contributions for the same\nfinal state, all of which have to be summed up to obtain the corresponding partial cross sections.\nIt is a unique feature of our approach to consider explicitly energy-momentum sharing at this\nlevel (the \"E\" in the name EPOS). For more details see [2].\n5\n\nHadronization\n\nAs mentionned already, the fragmentation procedure is a crucial ingredient of our model. Here,\nwe employ the string approach. Using fragmentation functions is certainly a useful concept for\njet fragmentation, but not necessarily for soft particle production.\nWe will identify parton ladders with classical strings. Here, we consider only strings x with\npiecewise constant intial conditions v(\u03c3) \u2261 \u2202x/\u2202\u03c4 (\u03c3, \u03c4 = 0), which are called kinky strings.\nSo the string is characterized by a sequence of \u03c3 intervals [\u03c3k , \u03c3k+1 ], and the corresponding\nvelocities vk . Such an interval with the corresponding constant value of v is referred to as \"kink\".\nNow we are in a position to map partons onto strings: we identify the ladder partons with the\n264\n\nMPI08\n\n\fkinks of a kinky string, such that the length of the \u03c3-interval is given by the parton energies, and\nthe kink velocities are just the parton velocities. The string evolution is then completely given\nby these initial conditions, expressed in terms of parton momenta. Hadron production is finally\nrealized via string breaking, such that string fragments are identified with hadrons. Here, we\nemploy the so-called area law hypothesis: the string breaks within an infinitesimal area dA on\nits surface with a probability which is proportional to this area, dP = pB dA,where pB is the\nfundamental parameter of the procedure.\n6\n\nCollective expansion\n\nRecent developments in EPOS concern the hydrodynamic expansion of matter in case of heavy\nion collisions \u2013 or high multiplicity events in very high energy proton-proton scattering, for\nexample at the LHC.\nThe elementary scatterings as discussed above lead to the formation of strings, which break\ninto segments, which are usually identified with hadrons. When it comes to high multiplicity\nevents in very high energy proton-proton scattering, the procedure is modified: one considers\nthe situation at an early proper time \u03c40 , long before the hadrons are formed: one distinguishes\nbetween string segments in dense areas (more than some critical density \u03c10 of segments per unit\nvolume), from those in low density areas. The high density areas are referred to as core, the\nlow density areas as corona [5]. Let us consider the core part. It is important to note that initial\nconditions from EPOS are based on strings, not on partons. Based on the four-momenta of the\nstring segments which constitute the core, we compute the energy density \u03b5(\u03c40 , \ufffdx) and the flow\nvelocity \ufffdv (\u03c40 , \ufffdx).\nHaving fixed the initial conditions, the system evolves according the equations of ideal\nhydrodynamics, see fig. 4, until the energy density reaches some critical value (usually expressed\nin terms of a critical temperature). In the simplest case, particles freeze out immediately at this\nfreeze out hypersurface, based on the Cooper-Frye prescription.\n\nfreeze out\nfluid\nt\nz\nFig. 4: Sketch of a hydrodynamic evolution in space time, starting from the hyperbola representing the initial proper\ntime.\n\nThe interesting question arises whether such \"collective expansion effects\" matter for pp.\nThere are several signs which suggest this, for example the increase of the mean transverse\nMPI08\n\n265\n\n\fmean pt\n\n2\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n\n|\u03b7|<1 pt>0.4\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nNch\nFig. 5: The mean transverse momentum of (from top to bottom) lambdas, kaons, and pions, in pp collisions at 1800\nGeV.

Real hydrodynamical calculations will be performed soon.\n7\n\nSummary\n\nTo summarize: we have discussed multiple scattering as realized by the EPOS model, which is\nexpected to be a very important issue for proton-proton scattering at the LHC.\nReferences\n[1] Klaus Werner, Fu-Ming Liu, Tanguy Pierog, Phys.

We also present\nnew tuning results for the Pythia 6.4 event generator which are based\non event shape and hadronisation observables from e+ e\u2212 experiments,\nand on underlying event and minimum bias data from the Tevatron.\nOur new tunes are compared to existing tunes and to Peter Skands'\nnew \"Perugia\" tunes.\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nWith the LHC starting soon, collider based particle physics is about to enter a new energy regime.\nEverybody is excited about the possibilities of finding new physics beyond the TeV scale, but the\nvast majority of events at the LHC will be Standard Model QCD events. The proton will be\nprobed at low Bj\u00f6rken x where current PDF fits have large uncertainties, jets above 1 TeV will\nbe seen, and the behaviour of the pp total cross-section and multiple parton interactions will be\n\u221a\nmeasured at values of s where extrapolation from current data is challenging. No discoveries\nof new physics can be claimed before the Standard Model at these energies is measured and\nunderstood.\nMonte Carlo event generators play an important role in virtually every physics analysis\nat collider experiments. They are used to evaluate signal and background events, and to design\nthe analyses. It is essential that the simulations describe the data as accurately as possible. The\nmain point here is not to focus on just one or two distributions, but to look at a wide spectrum\nof observables. Only if the Monte Carlo agrees with many complementary observables can we\ntrust it to have predictive power, and from disagreements we can learn something about model\ndeficiencies and the underlying physics.\nAs Monte Carlo event generators are based on phenomenological models and approximations, there are a number of parameters that need to be tweaked if the generator is to describe the\nexperimental data. In the first part of this talk we present a strategy for systematic Monte Carlo\nparameter tuning. In the second part two new tunes of the Pythia 6.4 generator [1] are presented\nand compared to other tunings.\n2\n\nMC tuning\n\nEvery Monte Carlo event generator has a number of relatively free parameters which must be\ntuned to make the generator describe experimental data in the best possible way. Such parame\u2020\n\nspeaker\n\nMPI08\n\n267\n\n\fters can be found almost everywhere in Monte Carlo generators \u2013 all the way from the (perturbative) hard interaction to the (non-perturbative) hadronisation process. Naturally the majority of\nparameters are found in the non-perturbative physics models.\nWhile all the parameters have a physical motivation in their models, there are usually only\nrough arguments about their scale. Other parameters are measured experimentally (like \u03b1s ), but\nas the Monte Carlo event generators use them in a fixed-order scheme (unlike nature) they need\nto be adjusted, too.\nGoing through the steps of event generation and identifying the most important parameters,\none typically finds O(20\u201330) parameters of particular importance to collider experiments. Most\nof these parameters are highly correlated in a non-trivial way. We can group the parameters in\napproximately independent sets e. g. in flavour, fragmentation, and underlying event parameters,\nto reduce the number to be optimised against any single set of observables. Nevertheless, the\nnumber of parameters to be simultaneously tuned is O(10). A manual or brute-force approach to\nMonte Carlo tuning is not very practical: it is very slow, and manual tunings in particular depend\nvery much on the experience of the person performing the tuning (at the same time there is a\nstrong anti-correlation between experience and willingness to produce a new tune manually).\n2.1\n\nA systematic tuning strategy\n\nIn this talk, we describe the Professor tuning system, which eliminates the problems with manual\nand brute-force tunings by parameterising a generator's response to parameter shifts on a binby-bin basis, a technique introduced by the Delphi-collaboration [2, 3]. This parameterisation,\nunlike a brute-force method, is then amenable to numerical minimisation within a timescale short\nenough to make explorations of tuning criteria possible.\n2.1.1\n\nPredicting the Monte Carlo output\n\nThe first step of any tuning is to define the parameters that shall be varied, together with the variation intervals. This requires a thorough understanding of the generator's model, its parameters\nand the available data \u2013 all the relevant parameters for a certain model should enter the tuning, but\nnone of the irrelevant ones. A fragmentation tune for example must include the shower cut-off\nparameter, while a tune of the flavour composition had better not be dependent on it.\nOnce we have settled on a set of parameter intervals, it is time to obtain a predictive\nfunction for the Monte Carlo output. Actually we generate an ensemble of such functions. For\neach observable bin b a polynomial is fitted to the Monte Carlo response MCb to changes in the\nparameter vector p\ufffd = (p1 , . . . , pP ) of the P parameters varied in the tune. To account for lowestorder parameter correlations, a polynomial of at least second-order is used as the basis for bin\nparameterisation:\n\ufffd (b)\n\ufffd (b)\n(b)\nMCb (\ufffd\np) \u2248 f (b) (\ufffd\np) = \u03b10 +\n\u03b2i pi +\n\u03b3ij pi pj\n(1)\ni\n\ni\u2264j\n\nWe have tested this to give a good approximation of the true Monte Carlo response for real-life\nobservables.\n268\n\nMPI08\n\n\fThe number of parameters and the order of the polynomial fix the number of coefficients\nto be determined. For a second order polynomial in P parameters, the number of coefficients is\n(P )\n\nN2\n\n= 1 + P + P (P + 1)/2,\n\n(2)\n\nsince only the independent components of the matrix term are to be counted.\nGiven a general polynomial, we must now determine the coefficients \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 for each bin\nso as to best mimic the true generator behaviour. This could be done by a Monte Carlo numerical\nminimisation method, but there would be a danger of finding sub-optimal local minima, and automatically determining convergence is a potential source of problems. Fortunately, this problem\ncan be cast in such a way that a deterministic method can be applied.\nOne way to determine the polynomial coefficients would be to run the generator at as many\nparameter points, N , as there are coefficients to be determined. A square N \u00d7 N matrix can then\nbe constructed, mapping the appropriate combinations of parameters on to the coefficients to\nbe determined; a normal matrix inversion can then be used to solve the system of simultaneous\nequations and thus determine the coefficients. Since there is no reason for the matrix to be\nsingular, this method will always give an \"exact\" fit of the polynomial to the generator behaviour.\nHowever, this does not reflect the true complexity of the generator response: we have engineered\nthe exact fit by restricting the number of samples on which our interpolation is based, and it is safe\nto assume that taking a larger number of samples would show deviations from what a polynomial\ncan describe, both because of intrinsic complexity in the true response function and because of\nthe statistical sampling error that comes from running the generator for a finite number of events.\nWhat we would like is to find a set of coefficients (for each bin) which average out these effects\nand are a least-squares best fit to the oversampled generator points. As it happens, there is a\ngeneralisation of matrix inversion to non-square matrices \u2013 the pseudoinverse [4] \u2013 with exactly\nthis property.\nAs suggested, the set of anchor points for each bin are determined by randomly sampling the generator from N parameter space points in the P -dimensional parameter hypercube\n[ p\ufffdmin , p\ufffdmax ] defined by the user. This definition requires physics input \u2013 each parameter pi should\nhave its upper and lower sampling limits pmin,max chosen so as to encompass all reasonable values; we find that generosity in this definition is sensible, as Professor may suggest tunes which\nlie outside conservatively chosen ranges, forcing a repeat of the procedure. On the other hand the\nparameter range should not be too large, in order to keep the volume of the parameter space small\nand to make sure that the parabolic approximation gives a good fit to the true Monte Carlo response. Each sampled point may actually consist of many generator runs, which are then merged\ninto a single collection of simulation histograms. The simultaneous equations solution described\nabove is possible if the number of sampled points is the same as the number of coefficients be(P )\n(P )\ntween the P parameters, i.e. N = Nmin = N n . The more robust pseudoinverse method\n(P )\napplies when N > Nmin : we prefer to oversample by at least a factor of 2. The numerical\nimplementation of the pseudoinverse uses a standard singular value decomposition (SVD) [5].\n\nMPI08\n\n269\n\n\f2.1.2\n\nComparing to data and optimising the parameters\n\nWith the functions f (b) (\ufffd\np) we now have a very fast way of predicting the behaviour of the Monte\nCarlo generator. To get the Monte Carlo response for any parameter setting inside the defined\nparameter hypercube it is not necessary anymore to run the generator, but we can simply evaluate the polynomial. This allows us to define a goodness of fit function comparing data and\n(approximated) Monte Carlo which can be minimised in a very short time.\nWe choose a heuristic \u03c72 function, but other goodness of fit (GoF) measures can certainly\nbe used. Since the relative importance of various distributions in the observable set is a subjective\nthing \u2013 given 20 event shape distributions and one charged multiplicity, it is certainly sensible\nto weight up the multiplicity by a factor of at least 10 or so to maintain its relevance to the GoF\nmeasure \u2013 we include per-observable weights, wO for each observable O, in our \u03c72 definition:\n\u03c72 (\ufffd\np) =\n\n\ufffd\nO\n\nwO\n\n\ufffd (f (b) (\ufffd\np) \u2212 Rb )2\n,\n\u22062b\n\n(3)\n\nb\u2208O\n\nwhere Rb is the reference (i. e. data) value for bin b and the total error \u2206b is the sum in quadrature\nof the reference error and the statistical generator errors for bin b. In practice we attempt to\ngenerate sufficient events at each sampled parameter point that the statistical MC error is much\nsmaller than the reference error for all bins.\nIt should be noted that there is unavoidable subjectivity in the choice of these weights, and\na choice of equal weights is no more sensible than a choice of uniform priors in a Bayesian analysis; physicist input is necessary in both choosing the admixture of observable weights according\nto the criteria of the generator audience \u2013 a b-physics experiment may prioritise distributions that\na general-purpose detector collaboration would have little interest in \u2013 and to ensure that the end\nresult is not overly sensitive to the choice of weights.\nThe final stage is to minimise the parameterised \u03c72 function. It is tempting to think that\nthere is scope for an analytic global minimisation at this order of polynomial, but not enough\nHessian matrix elements may be calculated to constrain all the parameters and hence we must\nfinally resort to a numerical minimisation. This is the numerically weakest point in the method,\nas the weighted quadratic sum of hundreds of polynomials is a very complex function and there\nis scope for getting stuck in a non-global minimum. Hence the choice of minimiser is important.\nThe output from the minimisation is a vector of parameter values which, if the parameterisation and minimisation stages are faithful, should be the optimal tune according to the\n(subjective) criterion defined by the choice of observable weights.\n2.2\n\nTools\n\nWe have implemented the tuning strategy described above in the Professor software package.\nProfessor reads in Monte Carlo and data histogram files, parameterises the Monte Carlo response,\nand performs the \u03c72 minimisation.\nThe Monte Carlo histograms used as input for Professor are generated with Rivet [6]. Rivet\nis an analysis framework for Monte Carlo event generator validation. By reading in HepMC event\nrecords, Rivet can be used with virtually all common event generators, and this well-defined interface between generator and analysis tool ensures that the physics analyses are implemented\n270\n\nMPI08\n\n\fParameter\n\nPythia 6.418 default\n\nFinal tune\n\nPARJ(1)\nPARJ(2)\nPARJ(3)\nPARJ(4)\nPARJ(11)\nPARJ(12)\nPARJ(13)\nPARJ(25)\nPARJ(26)\n\n0.1\n0.3\n0.4\n0.05\n0.5\n0.6\n0.75\n1\n0.4\n\n0.073\n0.2\n0.94\n0.032\n0.31\n0.4\n0.54\n0.63\n0.12\n\ndiquark suppression\nstrange suppression\nstrange diquark suppression\nspin-1 diquark suppression\nspin-1 light meson\nspin-1 strange meson\nspin-1 heavy meson\n\u03b7 suppression\n\u03b7 \ufffd suppression\n\nTable 1: Tuned flavour parameters and their defaults.\n\nin a generator-independent way. A key feature of Rivet is that the reference data can be taken\ndirectly from the HepData archive [7] and is used to define the binnings of the Monte Carlo histograms, automatically ensuring that there is no problem with synchronising bin edge positions.\nAt present, there are about 40 key analyses mainly from LEP and Tevatron, but also from SLD,\nRHIC, PETRA, and other accelerators. More analyses are constantly being added.\n3\n\nTuning Pythia 6.4\n\nFor the first production tuning we chose the Pythia 6.4 event generator, as this is a well-known\ngenerator which has been tuned before and which we expected to behave well. Naturally the first\nstep in tuning a generator is to fix the flavour composition and the fragmentation parameters to\nthe precision data from LEP and SLD before continuing with the parameters related to hadron\ncollisions, for which we use data from the Tevatron.\n3.1\n\nParameter factorisation strategy\n\nIn Pythia the parameters for flavour composition decouple well from the non-flavour hadronisation parameters such as a, b, \u03c3q , or the shower parameters (\u03b1s , cut-off). Parameters related to\nthe underlying event and multiple parton interactions are decoupled from the flavour and fragmentation parameters. In order to keep the number of simultaneously tuned parameters small,\nwe decided to follow a three-stage strategy. In the first step the flavour parameters were optimised, keeping almost everything else at its default values (including using the virtuality-ordered\nshower). In the second step the non-flavour hadronisation and shower parameters were tuned \u2013\nusing the optimised flavour parameters obtained in the first step. The final step was tuning the\nunderlying event and multiple parton interaction parameters to data from CDF and D\u00d8.\n3.2\n\nFlavour parameter optimisation\n\nThe observables used in the flavour tune were hadron multiplicities and their ratios with respect to\nthe \u03c0 + multiplicity measured at LEP 1 and SLD [8], as well as the b-quark fragmentation function\nmeasured by the Delphi collaboration [9], and flavour-specific mean charged multiplicities as\nMPI08\n\n271\n\n\fmeasured by the Opal collaboration [10]. For this first production we chose to use a separate\ntuning of the Lund-Bowler fragmentation function for b-quarks (invoked in Pythia 6.4 by setting\nMSTJ(11) = 5) with a fixed value of rb = 0.8 (PARJ(47)), as first tests during the validation\nphase of the Professor framework showed that this setting yields a better agreement with data\nthan the default common Lund-Bowler parameters for c and b quarks.\nFor the tuning we generated 500k events at each of 180 parameter points. The tuned\nparameters are the basic flavour parameters like diquark suppression, strange suppression, or\nspin-1 meson rates. All parameters are listed in Tab. 1 together with the tuning results.\nSince the virtuality-ordered shower was used for tuning the flavour parameters, we tested\nour results also with the p\u22a5 -ordered shower in order to check if a separate tuning was necessary.\nTurning on the p\u22a5 -ordered shower and setting \u039bQCD = 0.23 (the recommended setting before\nour tuning effort) we obtained virtually the same multiplicity ratios as with the virtuality-ordered\nshower. This confirms the decoupling of the flavour and the fragmentation parameters and no\nre-tuning of the flavour parameters with the p\u22a5 -ordered shower is needed.\n3.3\n\nFragmentation optimisation\n\nBased on the new flavour parameter settings the non-flavour hadronisation and shower parameters\nwere tuned, separately for the virtuality-ordered and for the p\u22a5 -ordered shower. The observables\nused in this step of the tuning were event shape variables, momentum spectra, and the mean\ncharged multiplicity measured by the Delphi collaboration [3], momentum spectra and flavourspecific mean charged multiplicities measured by the Opal collaboration [10], and the b-quark\nfragmentation function measured by the Delphi collaboration [9].\nWe tuned the same set of parameters for both shower types (Tab. 2). To turn on the p\u22a5 ordered shower, MSTJ(41) was set to 12 \u2013 in the case of the virtuality-ordered shower, this\nparameter stayed at its default value. For both tunes, we generated 1M events at each of 100 parameter points.\nDuring the tuning of the p\u22a5 -ordered shower it transpired that the fit prefers uncomfortably\nlow values of the shower cut-off PARJ(82). Since this value needs to be at least 2 * \u039bQCD , and\npreferably higher, it was manually fixed to 0.8 to keep the parameters in a physically meaningful\nregime. Then the fit was repeated with the remaining five parameters.\nThe second issue we encountered with the p\u22a5 -ordered shower was that the polynomial\nparameterisation f (b) for the mean charged multiplicity differed from the real Monte Carlo response by about 0.2 particles. This discrepancy was accounted for during the \u03c72 minimisation,\nso that the final result does not suffer from a bias in this observable.\nIn Fig. 1 some comparison plots between the Pythia default and our new tune of the\nvirtuality-ordered shower are depicted. Even though this shower has been around for many years\nand Pythia has been tuned before, there still is room for improvement in the default settings.\nFig. 2 shows comparisons of the p\u22a5 -ordered shower. This shower is a new option in Pythia\nand has not been tuned systematically before. Nevertheless, the Pythia manual recommends to set\n\u039bQCD to 0.23. This recommendation is ignored by the ATLAS collaboration, so our plots show\nour new tune, the default with \u039bQCD = 0.23, and the settings currently used by ATLAS [11].\n272\n\nMPI08\n\n\f1/N dN/d(1 \u2212 T )\n\n1/N dN/dx p\n\nScaled momentum, x p = |p|/|pbeam |\nDELPHI\nPythia 6.418, Q2 new tune\nPythia 6.418, Q2 default\n\n10 2\n\n1 \u2212 Thrust\nDELPHI\nPythia 6.418, Q2 new tune\nPythia 6.418, Q2 default\n\n10 1\n\n10 1\n\n1\n\n1\n10\u22121\n10\u22121\n\nMC/data\n\nMC/data\n\n10\u22122\n1.4\n1.2\n\n1.4\n1.2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\nxp\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\nb quark fragmentation function f (xweak\n)\nB\n\nRapidity w. r. t.

This was based on various Drell-Yan, jet physics, and minimum bias\nmeasurements performed by CDF and D\u00d8 in Run-I and Run-II [12\u201318].\nThe new MPI model differs significantly from the old one, hence we had to tune different\nsets of parameters for these two cases. For the virtuality-ordered shower and old MPI model\nwe took Rick Field's tune DW [19] as guideline. In the case of the new model we consulted\nPeter Skands and used a setup similar to his tune S0 [20, 21] as starting point. All switches and\nparameters for the UE/MPI tune, and our results are listed in Tables 3 and 4.\nOne of the main differences we observed between the models is their behaviour in DrellYan physics. The old model had a hard time describing the Z-p\u22a5 spectrum [12] and we had to\nassign a high weight to that observable in order to force the Monte Carlo to get the peak region of\nthe distribution right (note that this is the only observable to which we assigned different weights\nfor the tunes of the old and the new MPI model). The new model on the other hand gets the Z-p\u22a5\nright almost out of the box, but underestimates the underlying event activity in Drell-Yan events\nas measured in [16]. The same behaviour can be observed in Peter Skands' tunes [22]. We are\ncurrently investigating this issue.\nAnother (albeit smaller) difference shows in the hump of the turn-on in many of the UE\ndistributions in jet physics. This hump is described by the new model, but mostly missing in the\nold model. Although the origin of this hump is thought to be understood, the model differences\nresponsible for its presence/absence in the two Pythia models is not yet known in any detail.\nFigures 3 to 7 show some comparisons between our new tune and various other tunes.\nFor the virtuality-ordered shower with the old MPI model we show Rick Field's tunes A [23]\nand DW [19] as references, since they are well-known and widely used. For the p\u22a5 -ordered\nshower and the new MPI framework we compare to Peter Skands' new Perugia0 tune [22]. We\nalso include the current ATLAS tune [11] (even though we don't believe it has good predictive\npower1 ), since it is widely used at the LHC.\n1\nNot only is the choice of fragmentation parameters unfortunate (as discussed in Section 3.3) and the tune fails to\ndescribe the underlying event in Drell-Yan events, but also the energy scaling behaviour in this tune is pretty much\nruled out by the data [24], making it in our eyes a particularly bad choice for LHC predictions.\n\nMPI08\n\n275\n\n\fCDF Run-I\nPythia 6.420, Q2 new tune\nPythia 6.420, tune A\nPythia 6.420, tune DW\n\n30\n25\n\np\u22a5 (Z) in Z \u2192 e+ e\u2212 events\n\n1/\u03c3 d\u03c3 /dp\u22a5\n\n1/\u03c3 d\u03c3 /dp\u22a5\n\np\u22a5 (Z) in Z \u2192 e+ e\u2212 events\n\nCDF Run-I\nPythia 6.420, p\u22a5 new tune\nPythia 6.420, tune Perugia0\nPythia 6.420, ATLAS tune\n\n25\n20\n\n20\n15\n15\n10\n10\n5\n\nMC/data\n\n0\n1.4\n1.2\n\n1.2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n0\n\n\ufffdp\u22a5 \ufffd / GeV\n\n1.2\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n30\np\u22a5 (Z) / GeV\n\nMean track p\u22a5 vs multiplicity, min bias\n\n0\n\n1.2\n\n1.1\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n30\np\u22a5 (Z) / GeV\n\nMean track p\u22a5 vs multiplicity, min bias\n\n1.1\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\nCDF Run-II\nPythia 6.420, Q2 new tune\nPythia 6.420, tune A\nPythia 6.420, tune DW\n\n0.8\n\n1.2\n1.1\n\n0.7\n1.2\n1.1\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\nCDF Run-II\nPythia 6.420, p\u22a5 new tune\nPythia 6.420, tune Perugia0\nPythia 6.420, ATLAS tune\n\n0.8\n\nMC/data\n\n0.7\nMC/data\n\n0\n1.4\n\n\ufffdp\u22a5 \ufffd / GeV\n\nMC/data\n\n5\n\n0.8\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\nNch\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\nNch\n\nFig. 3: The upper plots show the Z p\u22a5 distribution as measured by CDF [12] compared to different tunes of the\n\nvirtuality-ordered shower with the old MPI model (left) and the p\u22a5 -ordered shower with the interleaved MPI model\n\n(right).

At and around the Perugia workshop a bunch of new\ntunes appeared on the market: Our Professor tunes, Peter Skand's Perugia tunes (which are based\non our flavour and fragmentation parameters), and combinations of the well established Rick\nField tunes with our new flavour and fragmentation settings which even improve the agreement\nwith data at the Tevatron. All these tunes are directly available through the PYTUNE routine in\nPythia 6.420 or later.\nWe strongly encourage the LHC experiments to use one of these tunings instead of spending their valuable time on trying to tune themselves. Monte Carlo tuning requires a sound understanding of the models and of the data, and a very close collaboration with the generator authors.\nIn the current situation we highly recommend the use of either Peter Skands' Perugia tune or our\nnew tune if the user wants to go for the new MPI model, or a tune like DWpro or our tune of the\nvirtuality-ordered shower for a more conservative user who wants to use a well-proven model.\nAcknowledgements\nWe want to thank the organisers of the MPI@LHC workshop for this very productive and enjoyable meeting, and we are looking forward to its continuation.

Skands\nTheoretical Physics, Fermilab, MS106, Box 500, Batavia IL-60510, USA\nAbstract\nWe present 7 new tunes of the p\u22a5 -ordered shower and underlying-event\nmodel in P YTHIA 6.4. These \"Perugia\" tunes update and supersede the\nolder \"S0\" family. The new tunes include the updated LEP fragmentation and flavour parameters reported on by H. Hoeth at this workshop [1]. The hadron-collider specific parameters were then retuned\n(manually) using Tevatron min-bias data from 630, 1800, and 1960\nGeV, Tevatron Drell-Yan data at 1800 and 1960 GeV, as well as SPS\nmin-bias data at 200, 540, and 900 GeV. In addition to the central parameter set, related tunes exploring systematically soft, hard, parton\ndensity, and color structure variations are included. Based on these\nvariations, a best-guess prediction of the charged track multiplicity in\ninelastic, nondiffractive minimum-bias events at the LHC is made.\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nPerturbative calculations of collider observables rely on two important prerequisites: factorisation and infrared safety. These are the tools that permit us to relate the calculations to detectorlevel measured quantities, up to corrections of known dimensionality, which can then be suppressed (or enhanced!) by appropriate choices of the dimensionful scales appearing in the\npoblem. However, this approach does limit us to consider only a predefined class of observables,\nat a limited precision set by the aforementioned scales. In the context of the underlying event,\nsay, we are faced with the fact that we do not (yet) have factorisation theorems for this component, while at the same time acknowledging that not all collider measurements can be made\ninsensitive to it at a level comparable to the achievable experimental precision. And when considering observables such as track multiplicities, hadronisation corrections, or even short-distance\nresonance masses if the precision required is very high, we are confronted with quantities which\nmay be experimentally well measured but which are explicitly sensitive to infrared physics.\nLet us begin with factorisation. When applicable, factorisation allows us to subdivide the\ncalculation of an observable (regardless of whether it is infrared safe or not) into a perturbatively\ncalculable short-distance part and a universal long-distance part, the latter of which may be modeled and constrained by fits to data. However, in the context of hadron collisions the conceptual\nseparation into \"hard-scattering\" and \"underlying-event\" components is not necessarily equivalent to a clean separation in terms of \"hardness\" (or perhaps more properly formation time), since\nwhat is labeled the \"underlying event\" may contain short-distance physics of its own. Indeed,\nfrom ISR energies [2] through the SPS [3, 4] to the Tevatron [5\u20139], and even in photoproduction\nat HERA [10], we see evidence of (perturbative) \"minijets\" in the underlying event, beyond what\nbremsstrahlung alone appears to be able to account for. It would therefore seem apparent that a\n284\n\nMPI08\n\n\funiversal modeling of the underlying event must include at least some degree of correlation between the hard-scattering and underlying-event components. It is in this spirit that the concept of\n\"interleaved evolution\" [11] was developed as the cornerstone of the p\u22a5 -ordered models [11, 12]\nin both P YTHIA 6 [13] and, more recently, P YTHIA 8 [14].\nThe second tool, infrared safety, provides us with a class of observables which are insensitive to the details of the long-distance physics. This works up to corrections of order the\nlong-distance scale divided by the short-distance scale, Q2IR /Q2UV , where QUV denotes a generic\nhard scale in the problem and QIR \u223c \u039bQCD \u223c O(1 GeV). Since QIR /QUV \u2192 0 for large QUV ,\nsuch observables \"decouple\" from the infrared physics as long as all relevant scales are \ufffd QIR .\nOnly if we require a precision that begins to approach QIR should we begin to worry about nonperturbative effects for such observables. Infrared sensitive quantities, on the other hand, contain\nlogarithms logn (Q2UV /Q2IR ) which grow increasingly large as QIR /QUV \u2192 0. As an example,\nconsider particle or track multiplicities; in the absence of nontrivial infrared effects, the number\nof partons that would be mapped to hadrons in a na\u0131\u0308ve local-parton-hadron-duality [15] picture\ndepends logarithmically on the infrared cutoff.\nMin-bias/UE physics can therefore be perceived of as offering an ideal lab for studying\nnonfactorized and nonperturbative phenomena with the highest possible statistics, giving crucial\ntests of our ability to model and understand these ubiquitous components. As a beneficial side\neffect, the improved models and tunes that result from this effort are important ingredients in the\nmodeling of high-p\u22a5 physics, in the context of which the underlying event and nonperturbative\neffects furnish a nontrivial \"haze\" into which the high-p\u22a5 physics is embedded.\n\nAs part of the effort to spur more interplay between theorists and experimentalists in this\nfield, we here report on a new set of tunes of the p\u22a5 -ordered P YTHIA framework, which update\nand supersede the older \"S0\" family of tunes. The new tunes have been made available via the\nroutine PYTUNE starting from P YTHIA version 6.4.20.\n\nWe have here focused in particular on the energy scaling from lower energies towards the\nLHC and on attempting to provide at least some form of systematic uncertainty estimates, in the\nform of a small number of alternate parameter sets that represent systematic variations in some\nof the main tune parameters\nWe also present a few distributions that carry interesting and complementary information\nabout the underlying physics, updating and complementing those contained in [16]. For brevity,\nthis text only includes a representative selection, with more results available on the web [17].\nThe main point is that, while each plot represents a complicated cocktail of physics effects, such that any sufficiently general model presumably could be tuned to give an acceptable\ndescription observable by observable, it is very difficult to simultaneously describe the entire\nset. The real game is therefore not to study one distribution in detail, but to study the degree of\nsimultaneous agreement or disagreement over many, mutually complementary, distributions.\nWe have tuned the Monte Carlo in four consecutive steps:\n1. Final-State Radiation (FSR) and Hadronisation (HAD): using LEP data, tuned by Professor\n[1, 18].\n2. Initial-State Radiation (ISR) and Primordial kT : using the Drell-Yan p\u22a5 spectrum at 1800\nand 1960 GeV, as measured by CDF [19] and D\u00d8 [20], respectively. We treat the data\nMPI08\n\n285\n\n\fas fully corrected for photon bremsstrahlung effects in this case, i.e., we compare the\nmeasured points to the Monte Carlo distribution of the original Z boson. We believe this\nto be reasonably close to the definition used for the data points in both the CDF and D\u00d8\nstudies.\n3. Underlying Event (UE) and Beam Remnants (BR): using Nch [21], dNch /dp\u22a5 [22], and\n\ufffdp\u22a5 \ufffd (Nch ) [23] in min-bias events at 1800 and 1960 GeV, as measured by CDF. Note\nthat the Nch spectrum extending down to zero p\u22a5 measured by the E735 Collaboration\nat 1800 GeV [24] was left out of the tuning, since we were not able to consolidate this\nmeasurement with the rest of the data. We do not know whether this is due to intrinsic\nlimitations in the modeling or to a misinterpretation on our part of the measured result.\n4. Energy Scaling: using Nch in min-bias events at 200, 540, and 900 GeV, as measured\nby UA5 [25, 26], and at 630 and 1800 GeV, as measured by CDF [21]. Note that we\ninclude neither elastic nor diffractive Monte Carlo events in any of our comparisons, which\ncould affect the validity of the modeling for the first few bins in multiplicity. We therefore\nassigned less importance to these bins when doing the tunes. The last two steps were\niterated a few times.\nNote that the clean separation between the first and second points assumes jet universality, i.e.,\nthat a Z 0 , for instance, fragments in the same way at a hadron collider as it did at LEP. This\nis not an unreasonable first assumption, but it is still important to check it explicitly, e.g., by\nmeasuring strange to unstrange particle production ratios, vector to pseudoscalar meson ratios,\nand/or baryon to meson ratios in situ at hadron colliders.\nNote also that we do not include any explicit \"underlying-event\" observables here. Instead,\nwe rely on the large-multiplicity tail of minimum-bias events to mimic the underlying event. A\nsimilar procedure was followed for the older \"S0\" tune [27, 28], which turned out to give a\nvery good simultaneous description of both minimum-bias and underlying-event physics at the\nTevatron, despite only having been tuned on minimum-bias data there1 . Conversely, Rick Field's\n\"Tune A\" [29\u201332] was originally only tuned on underlying-event data, but turned out to give a\nvery good simultaneous description of minimum-bias physics. We perceive of this as good, if\ncircumstantial, evidence of the universal properties of the P YTHIA modeling.\nAdditional important quantities to consider for further validation (and eventually tuning,\ne.g., in the Professor framework), would be observables involving explicit jet reconstruction and\nexplicit underlying-event observables in leading-jet, dijet, jet + photon, and Drell-Yan events.\nSome of these have already been included in the Professor framework, see [1, 18]. See also\nthe underlying-event sections in the HERA-and-the-LHC [33], Tevatron-for-LHC [32], and Les\nHouches write-ups [34].\n2\n\nMain Features of the Perugia Tunes\n\nIn comparison with tunes of the old (P YTHIA 6.2) framework [35], such as Tune A [29\u201332], all\ntunes of the new framework share a few common features. Let us first describe those, with plots\nto illustrate each point, and then turn to the properties of the individual tunes.\n1\n\nNote: when extrapolating to other energies, the alternative scaling represented by \"S0A\" appears to be preferred\nover the default scaling used in \"S0\".\n\n286\n\nMPI08\n\n\fCDF data\n\n-1\n\nPerugia 0\n\n10\n\nTevatron 1800 GeV\n\nDrell-Yan\n\nTransverse Momentum of Z/\u03b3* [66 < MZ/\u03b3*/GeV < 116] (peak)\nCDF data\n\n-1\n\nS0(A)\n\n1/\u03c3 d\u03c3/dp\u22a5\n\nDrell-Yan\n\nTransverse Momentum of Z/\u03b3* [66 < MZ/\u03b3*/GeV < 116] (peak)\n\n1/\u03c3 d\u03c3/dp\u22a5\n\n1/\u03c3 d\u03c3/dp\u22a5\n\n10\n\nTevatron 1800 GeV\n\n10\n\nTevatron 1800 GeV\n\nDrell-Yan\n\nTransverse Momentum of Z/\u03b3* [66 < MZ/\u03b3*/GeV < 116] (peak)\nCDF data\n\n-1\n\nPerugia 0\n\nPro-pT0\n\nS0(A)-Pro\n\nPerugia HARD\n\nPro-Q20\n\nPerugia 0\n\nPerugia SOFT\n\nDW(T)-Pro\n\nPro-pT0\n\nPerugia 3\n\nA\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n10\n\n5\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-2\n\nPythia 6.420\n\nPythia 6.420\n\nPythia 6.420\n\nData from CDF Collaboration, PRL84(2000)845\n\nData from CDF Collaboration, PRL84(2000)845\n\nData from CDF Collaboration, PRL84(2000)845\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n25\n30\np\u22a5(hard system) [GeV]\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n25\n30\np\u22a5(hard system) [GeV]\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n25\n30\np\u22a5(hard system) [GeV]\n\nFig. 1: Comparisons to the CDF Run I measurement of the p\u22a5 of Drell-Yan pairs [19]. Left: a representative selection\nof models. Center: different tunes of the new framework. Right: the range spanned by the main Perugia variations.\n\nComparisons to the D\u00d8 Run II measurement [20] and results with more tunes can be found at [17]. Note that the\nMonte Carlo curves shown are for the p\u22a5 of the original boson rather than of the lepton pair after (QED) showering.\n\nFirst of all, the new p\u22a5 -ordered showers [11] employ a dipole-style recoil model, which\nappears to make it very easy to obtain a good agreement with, e.g., the Drell-Yan p\u22a5 spectrum.\nIn the old model with default settings, the Drell-Yan spectrum is only well described if FSR off\nISR jets is switched off. When switching this back on, which is of course necessary to obtain\nthe desired perturbative broadening of the ISR jets, the old shower kinematics work in such a\nway that each FSR emission off a final-state parton from ISR effectively removes p\u22a5 from the\nZ boson, shifting the spectrum towards lower values. This causes any tune of the old P YTHIA\nframework with default ISR settings - such as Tune A or the ATLAS DC2/\"Rome\" tune - to\npredict a too narrow spectrum for the Drell-Yan p\u22a5 distribution, as illustrated in fig. 1.\nTo re-establish agreement with the measured spectrum without changing the recoil kinematics, the total amount of ISR in the old model had to be increased. This was done by choosing\nextremely low values of the renormalisation scale (and hence large \u03b1s values) for ISR (tunes DWPro and Pro-Q20 in fig. 1). While this nominally works, the whole business does smell faintly\nof fixing one problem by introducing another and hence the default in P YTHIA has remained the\nunmodified Tune A, at the price of retaining the poor agreement with the Drell-Yan spectrum.\n\nIn the new p\u22a5 -ordered showers [11], however, FSR off ISR is treated within individual\nQCD dipoles and does not affect the Drell-Yan p\u22a5 . This appears to make the spectrum come\nout generically much closer to the data. The only change from the standard \u03b1s (p\u22a5 ) choice used\nin the S0 family of tunes was thus switching to the so-called CMW choice [36] for \u039bQCD for\nISR in the Perugia tunes, rather than the MS value used previously, similarly to what is done in\nH ERWIG [37, 38]. The effect of this relatively small change can be seen by comparing S0(A),\nwhich uses the MS value, to Perugia 0 in the middle plot on fig. 1. The extremal curves on the\n\u221a\nright plot are obtained by using \u03b1CMW\n( 12 p\u22a5 ) (HARD) and \u03b1MS\ns\ns ( 2p\u22a5 ) (SOFT).\n\nSecondly, as mentioned above, we here include data from different colliders at different\nenergies, in an attempt to fix the energy scaling better.

Results with more tunes can be found\nat [17].\n\nenergy scaling behaviour in P YTHIA results in the overall activity growing too fast with collider\nenergy. This can be mitigated by increasing the dependence of the MPI infrared cutoff on collider\n0.16 (the default,\nenergy. For Tune A, Rick Field increased the power of this dependence from \u221d Ecm\n0.25\nsee [13]) to \u221d Ecm . The Perugia tunes incorporate a large range of values, between 0.22 and\n0.32, with Perugia 0 using 0.26, i.e., very close to the Tune A value. Note that the default was\n2 )0.08 . It\noriginally motivated by the scaling of the total cross section, which grows like \u221d (Ecm\ntherefore seems that at least in the current models, the colour screening / infrared cutoff of the\nindividual multi-parton interactions needs to scale significantly faster than the total cross section.\nA discussion of whether this tendency could be given a meaningful physical interpretation (e.g.,\nin terms of low-x, saturation, or unitarisation effects) is beyond the scope of this contribution.\nAs evident from fig. 2, the Perugia tunes all describe the Tevatron Nch distributions at 630\n(top) and 1800 (bottom) GeV within an acceptable margin. Note that the charged track definition\nis here p\u22a5 > 0.4 GeV, |\u03b7| < 1.0, and particles with c\u03c4 \u2265 10mm treated as stable. To highlight\nthe difference in the scaling, the middle plot shows both Tune S0 and Tune S0A at 630 GeV.\nThese are identical at 1800 GeV and only differ by the energy scaling, with S0 using the default\n288\n\nMPI08\n\n\fUA5 data\n-1\n\nPerugia 0\nPro-pT0\nPro-Q20\n\nInelastic, Non-Diffractive\n\nCharged Particle Multiplicity (|\u03b7|<1.5, all p\u22a5)\nUA5 data\n\n10\n\n-1\n\nS0\nS0A\nS0A-Pro\n\nDW-Pro\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-2\n\nA\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-2\n\nPro-pT0\n\n-3\n\n20\n\n30\n\nUA5 900 GeV\n\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n40\n50\nNch (|\u03b7|<1.5, all p\u22a5)\n\nInelastic, Non-Diffractive\n\nCharged Particle Multiplicity (|\u03b7|<1.5, all p\u22a5)\nUA5 data\n-1\n\nPerugia 0\nPro-pT0\nPro-Q20\n\n10\n\nProbability(Nch)\n\nProbability(Nch)\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\nA\n\n-3\n\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n\n20\n\n0\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n40\n50\nNch (|\u03b7|<1.5, all p\u22a5)\n\nInelastic, Non-Diffractive\n\nCharged Particle Multiplicity (|\u03b7|<1.5, all p\u22a5)\nUA5 data\n-1\n\nS0\nS0A\nS0A-Pro\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n60\nNch (|\u03b7|<1.5, all p\u22a5)\n\n30\n\nUA5 900 GeV\n\n1\n\n10\n\nData from UA5 Collaboration, Z Phys 43(1988)357\n\n-5\n\n-2\n\nPro-pT0\n\n-3\n\nInelastic, Non-Diffractive\nUA5 data\n\n-1\n\nPerugia 0\nPerugia HARD\nPerugia SOFT\nPerugia 3\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\nPythia 6.420\n\nData from UA5 Collaboration, Z Phys 43(1988)357\n\n20\n\n40\n\n40\n50\nNch (|\u03b7|<1.5, all p\u22a5)\n\nCharged Particle Multiplicity (|\u03b7|<1.5, all p\u22a5)\n\nPythia 6.420\n\nData from UA5 Collaboration, Z Phys 43(1988)357\n\n40\n\n-3\n\nPerugia 0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n-2\n\nPythia 6.420\n\n30\n\nUA5 900 GeV\n\n1\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n-5\n\nPerugia HARD\nPerugia 3\n\nData from UA5 Collaboration, Z Phys 43(1988)357\n\n-5\n\nPythia 6.420\n\n10\n\nPerugia 0\nPerugia SOFT\n\n10\n\n10\n\nDW-Pro\n-2\n\n-1\n\nPythia 6.420\n\nData from UA5 Collaboration, Z Phys 43(1988)357\n\n-5\n\nUA5 data\n\n10\n\nPythia 6.420\n\n10\n\nInelastic, Non-Diffractive\n\nCharged Particle Multiplicity (|\u03b7|<1.5, all p\u22a5)\n\nPerugia 0\n\n10\n\n-4\n\nUA5 200 GeV\n\n1\n\n10\n\nProbability(Nch)\n\n10\n\nUA5 200 GeV\n\n1\n\nProbability(Nch)\n\nInelastic, Non-Diffractive\n\nCharged Particle Multiplicity (|\u03b7|<1.5, all p\u22a5)\n\nProbability(Nch)\n\nProbability(Nch)\n\nUA5 200 GeV\n\n1\n\n60\nNch (|\u03b7|<1.5, all p\u22a5)\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\nData from UA5 Collaboration, Z Phys 43(1988)357\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\nNch (|\u03b7|<1.5, all p\u22a5)\n\nFig. 3: Comparisons to the UA5 measurements of the charged track multiplicity in minimum-bias pp\u0304 collisions at 200\nGeV (top row) and at 900 GeV (bottom row).

It is mainly the comparative failure\nof S0 with the default scaling to describe the 630 GeV data on the top middle plot in fig. 2 that\ndrives the choice of a slower-than-default pace of the energy scaling of the activity (equivalent to\na higher scaling power of the infrared cutoff, as discussed above).\nA similar comparison to UA5 data at two different energies, but now in a slightly larger \u03b7\nregion and including all p\u22a5 is shown in fig. 3. Since the data here includes all p\u22a5 , the theoretical\nmodels have been allowed to deviate slightly more from the data than for the Tevatron and the\nfirst few bins were ignored, to partly reflect uncertainties associated with the production of very\nsoft particles.\nThe good news, from the point of view of LHC physics, is that even the most extreme\nPerugia variants need to have a more slowly growing activity than the default. Thus, their extrapolations to the LHC produce less underlying event than those of their predecessors that used the\ndefault scaling, such as S0, DWT, or ATLAS-DC2/Rome.\nThirdly, while the charged particle p\u22a5 spectrum (see [17, dN/dpT]) and Nch distribution\nin Tune A was in almost perfect agreement with Tevatron min-bias data, the high-multiplicity\nbehaviour of the \ufffdNch \ufffd (p\u22a5 ) distribution was slightly too high [23].

The SOFT and HARD\nvariations were here allowed to deviate by significantly more than the statistical precision due to the high sensitivity\nof the distribution and the large theoretical uncertainties. Results with more tunes can be found at [17].\n\ncarried over to the S0 family of tunes of the new framework, since these were tuned to Tune A,\nin the absence of published data. Fortunately, CDF data has now been made publicly available\n[23], and hence it was possible to take the actual data into consideration for the Perugia tunes,\nresulting in somewhat softer particle spectra in high-multiplicity events, cf. fig. 4. Note that this\ndistribution is highly sensitive to the colour structure of the events, as emphasized in [27, 28, 35,\n39].\nFinally, the old framework did not include showering off the MPI in- and out-states2 . The\nnew framework does include such showers, which furnishes an additional fluctuating physics\ncomponent. Relatively speaking, the new framework therefore needs less fluctuations from other\nsources in order to describe the same data. This is reflected in the tunes of the new framework\ngenerally having a less lumpy proton (smoother proton transverse density distributions) and fewer\ntotal numbers of MPI than the old one. We included illustrations of this in a special \"theory\"\nsection of the web plots, cf. [17, Theory Plots] and [16, Fig. 4].\nThe showers off the MPI also lead to a greater degree of decorrelation and p\u22a5 imbalance\nbetween the minijets produced by the underlying event, in contrast to the old framework where\nthese remained almost exactly balanced and back-to-back. This should show up in minijet \u2206\u03c6jj\nand/or \u2206Rjj distributions sensitive to the underlying event, such as in Z/W +jets with low p\u22a5\ncuts on the additional jets.\nFurther, since showers tend to produce shorter-range correlations than MPI, the new tunes\nalso exhibit smaller long-range correlations than the old models. I.e., if there is a large fluctuation\nin one end of the detector, it is less likely in the new models that there is a large fluctuation in the\nsame direction in the other end of the detector. The impact of this, if any, on the overall modeling\n2\n\nIt did, of course, include showers off the primary interaction. S. Mrenna has since implemented FSR off the MPI\nas an additional option in that framework, but tunes using that option have not yet been made.\n\n290\n\nMPI08\n\n\fand correction procedures derived from it, has not yet been studied. At the very least it furnishes\na systematic difference between the models. For brevity, we do not include the plots here but\nrefer to the web [17, FB Correlation] and to the original P YTHIA MPI paper for a definition and\ncomparable plots [35].\n3\n\nTune-by-Tune Descriptions\n\nThe starting point for all the Perugia tunes, apart from Perugia NOCR, was S0(A)-Pro, i.e., the\noriginal tunes S0 and S0A, revamped to include the Professor tuning of flavour and fragmentation\nparameters to LEP data [1]. The starting point for Perugia NOCR was NOCR-Pro. From these\nstarting points, the main hadron collider parameters were retuned to better describe the above\nmentioned data sets. An overview of the tuned parameters and their values is given in table 1.\nPerugia 0 (320): Uses \u039bCMW instead of \u039bMS , which results in near-perfect agreement with\nthe Drell-Yan p\u22a5 spectrum, both in the tail and in the peak, cf. fig. 1, middle plot. Also has\nslightly less colour reconnections, especially among high-p\u22a5 string pieces, which improves the\nagreement both with the \ufffdp\u22a5 \ufffd (Nch ) distribution and with the high-p\u22a5 tail of charged particle p\u22a5\nspectra, cf [17, dN/dpT (tail)]). Compared to S0A-Pro, this tune also has slightly more beamremnant breakup (more baryon number transport), mostly in order to explore this possibility than\ndue to any necessity of tuning. Without further changes, these modifications would lead to a\ngreatly increased average multiplicity as well as larger multiplicity fluctuations. To keep the total\nmultiplicity unchanged, cf. the solid grey curves labeled \"Perugia 0\" on the plots in the top row\nof fig. 2, the changes above were accompanied by an increase in the MPI infrared cutoff, which\ndecreases the overall MPI-associated activity, and by a slightly smoother proton mass profile,\nwhich decreases the fluctuations. Finally, the energy scaling is closer to that of S0A than to the\ndefault one used for S0, cf. the middle panes in figs. 2 and 3.\nPerugia HARD (321): Variant of Perugia 0 which has a higher amount of activity from perturbative physics and counter-balances that partly by having less particle production from nonperturbative sources. Thus, the \u039bCMW value is used for ISR, together with a renormalisation scale\nfor ISR of \u03bcR = 12 p\u22a5 , yielding a comparatively hard Drell-Yan p\u22a5 spectrum, cf. the dashed curve\nlabeled \"HARD\" in the right pane of fig. 1. It also has a slightly larger phase space for both ISR\nand FSR, uses higher-than-nominal values for FSR, and has a slightly harder hadronisation. To\npartly counter-balance these choices, it has less \"primordial kT \", a higher infrared cutoff for the\nMPI, and more active color reconnections, yielding a comparatively high curve for \ufffdp\u22a5 \ufffd (Nch ),\ncf. fig. 4.\nPerugia SOFT (322): Variant of Perugia 0 which has a lower amount of activity from perturbative physics and makes up for it partly by adding more particle production from nonperturbative sources. Thus, the \u039bMS value is used for ISR, together with a renormalisation scale of\n\u221a\n\u03bcR = 2p\u22a5 , yielding a comparatively soft Drell-Yan p\u22a5 spectrum, cf. the dotted curve labeled\n\"SOFT\" in the right pane of fig. 1. It also has a slightly smaller phase space for both ISR and\nFSR, uses lower-than-nominal values for FSR, and has a slightly softer hadronisation.

The starting point, S0A-Pro, is shown for reference. (BR stands for Beam Remnants\nand CR stands for Colour Reconnections.)\n\n292\n\nMPI08\n\n\fcounter-balance these choices, it has a more sharply peaked proton mass distribution, a more\nactive beam remnant fragmentation (lots of baryon transport), a slightly lower infrared cutoff\nfor the MPI, and slightly less active color reconnections, yielding a comparatively low curve for\n\ufffdp\u22a5 \ufffd (Nch ), cf. fig. 4.\nPerugia 3 (323): Variant of Perugia 0 which has a different balance between MPI and ISR\nand a different energy scaling. Instead of a smooth dampening of ISR all the way to zero p\u22a5 , this\ntune uses a sharp cutoff at 1.25 GeV, which produces a slightly harder ISR spectrum. The additional ISR activity is counter-balanced by a higher infrared MPI cutoff. Since the ISR cutoff is\nindependent of the collider CM energy in this tune, the multiplicity would nominally evolve very\nrapidly with energy. To offset this, the MPI cutoff itself must scale very quickly, hence this tune\nhas a very large value of the scaling power of that cutoff. This leads to an interesting systematic\ndifference in the scaling behaviour, with ISR becoming an increasingly more important source\nof particle production as the energy increases in this tune, relative to Perugia 0.\nPerugia NOCR (324): An update of NOCR-Pro that attempts to fit the data sets as well as\npossible, without invoking any explicit colour reconnections. Can reach an acceptable agreement\nwith most distributions, except for the \ufffdp\u22a5 \ufffd (Nch ) one, cf. fig. 4.\nPerugia X (325): A Variant of Perugia 0 which uses the MRST LO* PDF set [40]. Due to\nthe increased gluon densities, a slightly lower ISR renormalisation scale and a higher MPI cutoff\nthan for Perugia 0 is used. Note that, since we are not yet sure the implications of using LO* for\nthe MPI interactions have been fully understood, this tune should be considered experimental for\nthe time being. See [17, Perugia PDFs] for distributions.\nPerugia 6 (326): A Variant of Perugia 0 which uses the CTEQ6L1 PDF set [41]. Identical to\nPerugia 0 in all other respects, except for a slightly lower MPI infrared cutoff at the Tevatron and\na lower scaling power of the MPI infrared cutoff. See [17, Perugia PDFs] for distributions.\n4\n\nExtrapolation to the LHC\n\nPart of the motivation for updating the S0 family of tunes was specifically to improve the constraints on the energy scaling to come up with tunes that extrapolate more reliably to the LHC.\nThis is not to say that the uncertainty is still not large, but as mentioned above, it does seem that,\ne.g., the default P YTHIA scaling has by now been convincingly ruled out, and so this is naturally\nreflected in the updated parameters.\nFig. 5 contains predictions for the Drell-Yan p\u22a5 distribution (using the CDF cuts), the\ncharged track multiplicity distribution in minimum-bias collisions, and the average track p\u22a5 as\na function of multiplicity at 14 TeV, for the central, hard, soft, and \"3\" variations of the Perugia\ntunes. We hope this helps to give a feeling for the kind of ranges spanned by the Perugia tunes\n(the PDF variations give almost identical results to Perugia 0 for these distributions). A full set\nof plots illustrating the extrapolations to the LHC for both the central region |\u03b7| < 2.5 as well as\nthe region 1.8 < \u03b7 < 4.9 covered by LHCb can be found on the web [17].\nMPI08\n\n293\n\n\fDrell-Yan\n\nTransverse Momentum of Z/\u03b3* [66 < MZ/\u03b3*/GeV < 116] (peak)\nPerugia 0\nPerugia HARD\nPerugia SOFT\nPerugia 3\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-1\n\nLHC 14 TeV\n\nInelastic, Non-Diffractive\n\nCharged Particle Multiplicity (|\u03b7|<2.5, p\u22a5>0.5GeV)\nPerugia 0\nPerugia HARD\n\n-2\n\n<pT> [GeV]\n\nLHC 14 TeV\n-1\n\nProbability(Nch)\n\n1/\u03c3 d\u03c3/dp\u22a5\n\n10\n\n2\n\nLHC 14 TeV\n\nInelastic, Non-Diffractive\n\nAverage Charged Particle pT (|\u03b7|<2.5, p\u22a5>0.5GeV)\nPerugia 0\nPerugia HARD\n\nPerugia SOFT\n\nPerugia SOFT\n\nPerugia 3\n\nPerugia 3\n\n-3\n\n1.5\n-4\n\n-5\n\n1\n10\n\n-6\n\nPythia 6.420\n\n10\n\nPythia 6.420\n\n-3\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n40\n50\np\u22a5(hard system) [GeV]\n\n10\n\nPythia 6.420\n\n-7\n\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\n75\n100\nNch (|\u03b7|<2.5, p\u22a5>0.5GeV)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n100\n120\nNch (|\u03b7|<2.5, p\u22a5>0.5GeV)\n\nFig. 5: Perugia \"predictions\" for the p\u22a5 of Drell-Yan pairs (left), the charged track multiplicity in min-bias (center),\nand the average track p\u22a5 in min-bias (right) at the LHC. See [17] for additional plots.\n\nHowever, in addition to these plots, we thought it would be interesting to make at least one\nset of numerical predictions for an infrared sensitive quantity that could be tested with the very\nearliest LHC data. We therefore used the Perugia tunes and their variations to get an estimate for\nthe mean multiplicity of charged tracks in (inelastic, nondiffractive) minimum-bias pp collisions\nat 10 and 14 TeV. The Perugia variations indicate an uncertainty of order 15% or less on the\ncentral values, which is probably an underestimate, due to the limited nature of the models.\nNonetheless, having spent a significant amount of effort in making these estimates, given in\ntab. 2, we intend to stick by them until proved wrong. The acknowledgments therefore contain a\nrecognition of a bet to that effect.\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have presented a set of updated parameter sets (tunes) for the interleaved p\u22a5 -ordered shower\nand underlying-event model in P YTHIA 6.4. These parameter sets include the revisions to the\nfragmentation and flavour parameters obtained by the Professor group and reported on elsewhere\nin these proceedings [1]. The new sets further include more Tevatron data and more data from\ndifferent collider CM energies in an attempt to simultaneously improve the overall description at\nthe Tevatron data while also improving the reliability of the extrapolations to the LHC. We have\nalso attempted to deliver a first set of \"tunes with uncertainty bands\", by including alternative\ntunes with systematically different parameter choices. The new tunes are available from Pythia\nversion 6.4.20, via the routine PYTUNE.\nWe note that these tunes still only included Drell-Yan and minimum-bias data directly;\nleading-jet, photon+jet, and underlying-event data was not considered explicitly. This is not\nexpected to be a major problem due to the good universality properties that the P YTHIA modeling\nhas so far exhibited, but it does mean that the performance of the tunes on such data sets should\nbe tested, which will hopefully happen in the near future.\nWe hope these tunes will be useful to the RHIC, Tevatron, and LHC communities.\n\n294\n\nMPI08\n\n\fPredictions for Mean Densities of Charged Tracks\n\ufffdNch \ufffd |Nch \u22650\n\u2206\u03b7\u2206\u03c6\n\n\ufffdNch \ufffd |Nch \u22651\n\u2206\u03b7\u2206\u03c6\n\n\ufffdNch \ufffd |Nch \u22652\n\u2206\u03b7\u2206\u03c6\n\n\ufffdNch \ufffd |Nch \u22653\n\u2206\u03b7\u2206\u03c6\n\n\ufffdNch \ufffd |Nch \u22654\n\u2206\u03b7\u2206\u03c6\n\n0.40 \u00b1 0.05\n\n0.41 \u00b1 0.05\n\n0.43 \u00b1 0.05\n\n0.46 \u00b1 0.06\n\n0.50 \u00b1 0.06\n\nLHC 10 TeV\nLHC 14 TeV\n\n0.44 \u00b1 0.05\n\n0.45 \u00b1 0.06\n\n0.47 \u00b1 0.06\n\n0.51 \u00b1 0.06\n\n0.54 \u00b1 0.07\n\nTable 2: Best-guess predictions for the mean density of charged tracks for min-bias pp collisions at two LHC energies.\nThese numbers should be compared to data corrected to 100% track finding efficiency for tracks with |\u03b7| < 2.5 and\n\np\u22a5 > 0.5 GeV and 0% efficiency outside that region. The definition of a stable particle was set at c\u03c4 \u2265 10mm (e.g.,\nthe two tracks from a \u039b0 \u2192 p+ \u03c0 \u2212 decay were not counted). The \u00b1 values represent the estimated uncertainty, based\n\non the Perugia tunes. Since the lowest multiplicity bins may receive large corrections from elastic/diffractive events,\nit is possible that it will be easier to compare the (inelastic nondiffractive) theory to the first data with one or more of\nthe lowest multiplicity bins excluded, hence we have here recomputed the means with up to the first 4 bins excluded.\n(These predictions were first shown at the 2009 Aspen Winter Conference.)\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to the organizers of this very enjoyable workshop, which brought people from\ndifferent communities together, and helped us take some steps towards finding a common language.

Throughout most of the stages of a\nhigh-energy heavy-ion (A-A) collision \u2013 from the initial nuclear wavefunctions, through the preequilibrium state just after the collision, and into the subsequent thermalized quark-gluon plasma\n(QGP) phase \u2013 MPIs are behind (hard and soft) multiparticle production mechanisms and the\ncollective behaviour of the produced quark-gluon medium.\nThe heavy-ions session of MPI'08 included five written contributions (three experimental,\ntwo theoretical) that showed in detail the crucial role of MPIs in our understanding of the physics\nof strongly interacting QCD matter:\n\u2022 Cyrille Marquet (\"Multiple partonic interactions in heavy-ion collisions\") focused on recent theoretical developments on heavy-ion collisions during the three first stages of the\ninteraction: (i) the initial-state characterized by saturated small-x gluon distributions described by the \"Color-Glass-Condensate\" effective field theory picture; (ii) the pre-equilibrium \"glasma\" phase formed right after the collision of the two nuclei accounting for\nmultiparticle production from the released interacting gluons; and (iii) extra gluon radiation due to parton energy loss traversing the dense medium.\n\u2022 Mark Strikman (\"Antishadowing and multiparton scattering in hard nuclear collisions\")\ndiscussed longitudinal and transverse parton correlations in hadron-nucleus collisions. The\ncontributions to MPI due to hard collisions of the projectile with different target nucleons\nare considered, showing how terms involving different target nucleons give rise to strong\nanti-shadowing corrections (of about a factor 12 for triple parton collisions) which, remarkably, do not depend on the transverse correlations. By comparing the MPI cross sections in\np-p and p-A collisions, the effects of longitudinal and transverse parton correlations may\nhence be disentangled.

On the one hand, the observed reduction of high-pT hadron (but\nnot direct \u03b3) yields in A-A compared to p-p collisions (scaled by a factor accounting for\nthe incoming parton fluxes), is a direct indication of final-state energy loss of the produced\npartons. On the other, the limited increase of multiple (soft) hadron production in A-A\ncollisions from 20-GeV to 200-GeV as compared to simple MPI approaches, is indicative of an initial-state reduction of the incoming parton densities with increasing collision\nenergies.\nMPI08\n\n301\n\n\f\u2022 The difficulties, challenges and perspectives of jet reconstruction in high-energy A-A collisions characterized by a huge underlying event background (about 2000 particles per unit\nrapidity at midrapidity are expected in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC) were discussed by\nMagali Estienne (\"Jet reconstruction in heavy-ion collisions\").\n\u2022 Andre Mischke (\"Heavy-quark and Quarkonia production in high-energy heavy-ion collisions\") reviewed the most important results in the heavy-quark and quarkonia sectors\nof heavy-ions collisions.

From the Color Glass Condensate, through the Glasma and into the Quark-Gluon-Plasma phase, MPI\nare at the origin of interesting novel QCD phenomena.\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nRelativistic heavy-ion collisions involve such large parton densities, that they are reactions where\nmultiple partonic interactions (MPI) abound, and in which those can be investigated. Through\nmost of the stages of a high-energy heavy-ion collision, MPI are not only important but crucial, and without their understanding, no robust QCD-based description of the collision can be\nachieved. During the different phases that the system goes through, from the initial nuclear wave\nfunctions, through the pre-equilibrium state just after the collision, and into the following thermalized quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and hadronic phases, MPI are at the origin of most interesting\nphenomena.\nHowever, one may wonder what can be described with first-principle weak-coupling QCD\ncalculations. It has been proposed that the early stages of the heavy-ion collision should be, perhaps until the QGP phase. The saturation of the initial nuclear wave functions, and the multiparticle production from the decay of strong color fields are phenomena which have been addressed\nby weak-coupling methods, as well as the quenching of hard probes via QGP-induced energy\nloss. In those calculations, MPI are characterized by momentum scales which, if hard enough,\njustify a weak coupling analysis.\nIn the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) picture of the nuclear wave function, the saturation\nscale Qs characterizes which quantum fluctuations can be treated incoherently and which cannot;\nin the glasma phase right after the collision of two CGCs, 1/Qs sets the time scale for the decay\nof the strong color fields; and in the QGP phase, the plasma saturation momentum characterizes\nwhat part of the wave function of hard probes is responsible for their energy loss, by becoming\nemitted radiation. In the following, I discuss the role played by MPI in those different stages.\n2\n\nThe saturation scale in the nuclear wave function\n\nThe QCD description of hadrons/nuclei in terms of quarks and gluons depends on the process\nunder consideration, on what part of the wave function is being probed. Consider a hadron\nmoving at nearly the speed of light along the light cone direction x+ , with momentum P + .\nDepending on their transverse momentum kT and longitudinal momentum xP + , the partons\ninside the hadron behave differently, reflecting the different regimes of the hadron wave function.\nMPI08\n\n303\n\n\fFig. 1: Left: diagram in the (kT2 = Q2 , x) plane picturing the hadron/nucleus in the different weakly-coupled regimes.\nThe saturation line separates the dilute (leading-twist) regime from the dense (saturation) regime. Right: when scattering a dilute probe on the hadron/nucleus, both multiple scatterings and saturation of the wave function are equally\nimportant at small x, when occupation numbers become of order 1/\u03b1s .\n\nWhen probing the (non-perturbative) soft part of the wave function, corresponding to partons with transverse momenta of the order of \u039bQCD \u223c 200 MeV, the hadron looks like a bound\nstate of strongly interacting partons. When probing the hard part of the wave function, corresponding to partons with kT \ufffd \u039bQCD and x \ufffd 1, the hadron looks like a dilute system of weakly\ninteracting partons.\nThe saturation regime of QCD describes the small\u2212x part of the wave function. When\nprobing partons that feature kT \ufffd \u039bQCD , and x \ufffd 1, the effective coupling constant \u03b1s log(1/x)\nis large, and the hadron looks like a dense system of weakly interacting partons, mainly gluons\n(called small\u2212x gluons). The larger kT is, the smallest x needs to be to enter the saturation\nregime. As pictured in Fig.1, this means that the separation between the dense and dilute regimes\nis characterized by a momentum scale Qs (x), called the saturation scale, which increases as x\ndecreases.\nA simple way to estimate the saturation scale is to equate the gluon-recombination crosssection \u03c3rec \u223c \u03b1s /kT2 with 1/\u03c1T \u223c \u03c0R2 /(xf (x, kT2 )), the inverse gluon density per unit of\ntransverse area. Indeed, when \u03c3rec \u03c1T \u223c 1, one expects recombination not to be negligible\nanymore. This gives:\n\u03b1s xf (x, Q2s )\n.\n(1)\nQ2s =\n\u03c0R2\nNote that \u03b1s (Q2s ) decreases as x decreases, so for small enough x, one deals with a weaklycoupled regime, even though non-linear effects are important. The scattering of dilute partons\n(with kT \ufffd Qs (x)) is described in the leading-twist approximation in which they scatter incoherently. By contrast, when the parton density is large (kT \u223c Qs (x)), partons scatter collectively.\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate (CGC) is an effective theory of QCD [1] which aims at describing this part of the wave function. Rather than using a standard Fock-state decomposition,\nit is more efficient to describe it with collective degrees of freedom, more adapted to account for\nthe collective behavior of the small-x gluons. The CGC approach uses classical color fields:\n\ufffd\n|h\ufffd = |qqq\ufffd + |qqqg\ufffd + . . . + |qqqg . . . ggg\ufffd + . . . \u21d2 |h\ufffd = D\u03c1 \u03a6xA [\u03c1] |\u03c1\ufffd .\n(2)\n304\n\nMPI08\n\n\fFig. 2: Left: typical diagram for the production of high\u2212pT particles, with large values of x being probed in the\nnuclear wave functions. Right: typical diagram for the production of bulk particles with pT \u223c Qs , where multiple\npartonic interactions are crucial. This is true in heavy-ion collisions, and pp collisions at very high energies.\n\nThe long-lived, large-x partons are represented by a strong color source \u03c1 \u223c 1/gS which is static\nduring the lifetime of the short-lived small-x gluons, whose dynamics is described by the color\nfield A \u223c 1/gS . The arbitrary separation between the field and the source is denoted xA . When\nprobing the CGC with a dilute object carrying a weak color charge, the color field A is directly\nobtained from \u03c1 via classical Yang-Mills equations:\n[D\u03bc , F \u03bc\u03bd ] = \u03b4+\u03bd \u03c1 ,\n\n(3)\n\nand it can be used to characterize the CGC wave function \u03a6xA [A].\nThis wave function is a fundamental object of this picture, it is mainly a non-perturbative\nquantity, but the xA evolution can be computed perturbatively. Requiring that observables are\nindependent of the choice of xA , a functional renormalization group equation can be derived.\nIn the leading-logarithmic approximation which resums powers of \u03b1S ln(1/xA ), the JIMWLK\nequation describes the evolution of |\u03a6xA [A]|2 with xA . The evolution of the saturation scale with\nx is then obtained from this equation.\nFinally, the information contained in the wave function, on gluon number and gluon correlations, can be expressed in terms of n-point correlators, probed in scattering processes. These\ncorrelators consist of Wilson lines averaged with the CGC wave function, and resum powers of\ngS A \u223c 1, i.e. scattering with an arbitrary number of gluons exchanged. In the CGC picture, both\nmultiple scatterings and non-linear QCD evolution are taken into account. Note that in terms of\noccupation numbers, in the saturation regime one reaches\n\ufffd\n\ufffdAA\ufffd = DA |\u03a6xA [A]|2 AA \u223c 1/\u03b1s .\n(4)\n\nTherefore, taking into account multiple scatterings in the collision is as important as the saturation of the wave function. A consistent calculation of MPI must include both.\n\nIt was not obvious that the CGC picture (2), which requires small values of xA , would be\nrelevant at present energies. One of the most acclaimed successes came in the context of d+Au\ncollisions at RHIC, where forward particle production pA \u2192 hX allows to reach small values\nof xA with a dilute probe well understood in QCD [2]. The prediction that the yield of high-pT\nparticles at forward rapidities in pA collisions is suppressed compared to A pp collisions, and\nshould decrease when increasing the rapidity, was confirmed.\nMPI08\n\n305\n\n\f1600\n\n2000\n\ndNch\nd\u03b7\n\nIPsat\nbCGC\n\u03bb = 0.3\n\u03bb = 0.2\nln s -- fit\nPHOBOS\n\n1400\n\n1200\n\ndNch/d\u03b7|\u03b7=0\n\nPb-Pb sNN=5.5 TeV\n\n1000\n\n800\n\n600\n\n1500\n\n1000\n\n400\nAu-Au 0-6%, sNN=200 GeV\n200\n\nAu-Au 0-6%, sNN=130 GeV\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\u03b7\n\n500\n\n100 RHIC\n\n1000\n\u221as [GeV]\n\nLHC\n\nFig. 3: The charged-particle multiplicity in AA collisions at RHIC and the LHC. In both approaches a few parameters\nare fixed to reproduce RHIC data, such as the initial value of Qs . Then the small-x evolution determines the multiplicity at the LHC. The predictions are similar, around 1400 charged particles at mid rapidity for central collisions.\n\n3\n\nMultiple partonic interactions in the Glasma\n\nThe Glasma is the result of the collision of two CGCs. In a high-energy heavy-ion collision,\neach nuclear wave function is characterized by a strong color charge, and the field describing the\ndynamics of the small-x gluons is the solution of\n[D\u03bc , F \u03bc\u03bd ] = \u03b4+\u03bd \u03c11 + \u03b4\u2212\u03bd \u03c12 .\n\n(5)\n\nThe field after the collision is non-trivial [3]: it has a strong component (A\u03bc \u223c 1/gs ), a component which is particle like (A\u03bc \u223c 1), and components of any strength in between. To understand\nhow this pre-equilibrium system thermalizes, one needs to understand how the Glasma field decays into particles. Right after the collision, the strong field component contains all modes. Then,\nas the field decays, modes with pT > 1/\u03c4 are not part of the strong component anymore, and for\nthose a particle description becomes more appropriate. After a time of order 1/Qs , this picture\nbreaks down, and it has been a formidable challenge to determine weather a fast thermalization\ncan be achieved within this framework, due to instabilities [4].\nA problem which can be more easily addressed is multiparticle production. The difficult\ntask is to express the cross-section in terms of the Glasma field, and this is when MPI must be\ndealt with, as pictured in Fig.2. This has first been done at tree level, and from the one-loop\ncalculation a factorization theorem could then be derived [5] (note an interesting possible application of the results to pp collisions: those first-principle calculations could inspire a model for\nthe underlying event). Predictions for the total charged-particle multiplicity in AA collisions at\nthe LHC are shown in Fig.3. Two approaches are compared: in the first, a simplified factorization (called kT factorization) is assumed but the energy evolution is accurately obtained from a\nnext-to-leading evolution equation [6]; in the second, the energy evolution is only parameterized\nbut MPI are correctly dealt with by solving classical Yang-Mills equations [7]. While a full nextleading treatment of both multiple scatterings and small-x evolution is desirable, the numbers\nobtained are similar, which indicates that the uncertainties in both approaches are under control.\n306\n\nMPI08\n\n\fRAA\n\nSTAR charged hadrons pT > 6 GeV/c\nI: DVGL R\nII: BDMPS c+b\nIII: DGLV R+EL\nIV: van Hees EL\nV: BDMPS c\n\n1\n\n10-1\n\nd+Au\nAu+Au (0-5%)\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n10\np (GeV/c)\nT\n\nFig. 4: Left: production of high-energy partons in a hard process, which then lose energy propagating through the\nplasma. Some quantum fluctuations in their wave function are put on shell while interacting with the medium and become emitted radiation. Right: the resulting particle production in AA collisions is suppressed (RAA < 1) compared\nto independent nucleon-nucleon collisions. The suppression is large for light hadrons, and similar for heavy mesons\n(those data are displayed in the figure), which is difficult to accommodate in a weakly-coupled QCD description.\n\n4\n\nThe saturation scale in the QCD plasma\n\nHard probes are believed to be understood well enough to provide clean measurements of the\nproperties of the QGP formed in heavy-ion collisions. A large amount of work has been devoted\nto understand what happens to a quark (of high energy E, mass M and Lorentz factor \u03b3 = E/M )\nas it propagates through a thermalized plasma [8]. MPI are a main ingredient of the perturbative\nQCD (pQCD) description of how a quark losses energy, until it thermalizes or exits the medium\n(see Fig.4).\nAt lowest order with respect to \u03b1s , quantum fluctuations in a quark wave function consist\nof a single gluon, whose energy we denote \u03c9 and transverse momentum k\u22a5 . The virtuality of that\n2 . Short-lived\nfluctuation is measured by the coherence time, or lifetime, of the gluon tc = \u03c9/k\u22a5\nfluctuations are highly virtual while longer-lived fluctuations are more easily put on shell when\nthey interact. The probability of the fluctuation is \u03b1s Nc , up to a kinematic factor which for heavy\nquarks suppresses fluctuations with \u03c9 > \u03b3k\u22a5 . This means that when gluons are put on-shell, they\nare not radiated in a forward cone around a heavy quark. This suppression of the available phase\nspace for radiation, the dead-cone effect, implies less energy loss for heavier quarks [9].\nIn pQCD, medium-induced gluon radiation is due to multiple scatterings of the virtual\ngluons. If, while undergoing multiple scattering, the virtual gluons pick up enough transverse\nmomentum to be put on shell, they become emitted radiation. The accumulated transverse momentum squared picked up by a gluon of coherence time tc is\np2\u22a5 = \u03bc2\n\ntc\n\u2261 q\u0302 tc\nl\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03bc2 is the average transverse momentum squared picked up in each scattering, and l is the\nmean free path. These medium properties are involved through the ratio q\u0302 = \u03bc2 /l.\nMPI08\n\n307\n\n\fSince only the fluctuations which pick up enough transverse momentum are freed (k\u22a5 <\n2 with p2 = q\u0302\u03c9/k 2 :\np\u22a5 ), the limiting value can be obtained by equating k\u22a5\n\u22a5\n\u22a5\nk\u22a5 < (q\u0302\u03c9)1/4 \u2261 Qs (\u03c9) .\n\n(7)\n\nThe picture is that highly virtual fluctuations with k\u22a5 > Qs do not have time to pick up enough\np\u22a5 to be freed, while the longer-lived ones with k\u22a5 < Qs do. That transverse momentum Qs\nwhich controls which gluons are freed and which are not is called the saturation scale. With\nheavy quarks, one sees that due to the dead cone effect, the maximum energy a radiated gluon\ncan have is \u03c9 = \u03b3k\u22a5 = \u03b3Qs (and its coherence time is tc = \u03b3/Qs ). This allows to estimate the\nheavy-quark energy loss:\n\u03b3Qs\ndE\n\u221d \u03b1s Nc\n= \u03b1s Nc Q2s .\n(8)\n\u2212\ndt\n\u03b3/Qs\nThe saturation momentum in this formula is the one that corresponds to the fluctuation which\ndominates the energy loss: Qs = (q\u0302\u03b3)1/3 .\nFor a plasma of extend L < tc = \u03b3 2/3 /q\u0302 1/3 , formula (8) still holds but with Q2s = q\u0302L.\nThese are the basic ingredients of more involved phenomenological calculations, but after comparisons with data, it has remained unclear if this perturbative approach can describe the suppression of high\u2212p\u22a5 particles. For instance, at RHIC temperatures, the value q\u0302 \u223c 1 \u2212 3 GeV2 /fm is\nmore natural than the 5 \u2212 10 GeV2 /fm needed to describe the data on light hadron production.\nIf one accepts to adjust q\u0302 to this large value, then the D and B mesons are naturally predicted to\nbe less suppressed than light hadrons, which is not the case (see Fig.4).\nWhile the present pQCD calculations should still be improved, and may be shown to work\nin the future, this motivated to think about strongly-coupled plasmas. The tools to address the\nstrong-coupling dynamics in QCD are quite limited, however for the N = 4 Super-Yang-Mills\n(SYM) theory, the AdS/CFT correspondence is a powerful approach used in many studies. The\nfindings for the strongly-coupled SYM plasma may provide insight for gauge theories in general,\nand some aspects may even be universal. One interesting result is that the total energy loss of\nhard probes goes as \u2206E \u221d L3 at strong coupling [10], instead of the L2 law at weak coupling.\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n\n308\n\nE.

Study of the such processes will allow\nto measure in a model independent way double parton distributions\nin nuclei and, in combination with the pp measurements - transverse\ncorrelations of partons in nucleons. It is also emphasized that ultraperipheral collisions (UPC) of nuclei will allow to study multiparton\ninteractions of photons with nuclei well before the pA collisions will\nbe available at the LHC. UPC will also provide a quick and effective\nway to test onset of a novel perturbative QCD regime of strong absorption for the interaction of small dipoles at the collider energies in the\nprocess \u03b3 + A \u2192 J/\u03c8 + \" gap\" + X at large momentum transfer t.\n1\n\nMultiparton collisions and generalized parton distributions\n\nIt was recognized already more than two decades ago [1] that the increase of parton densities at\nsmall x leads to a strong increase of the probability of nucleon-nucleon collisions where two or\nmore partons of each projectile experience pair-vice independent hard interactions. As a result\nat the LHC the multiparton interactions will be a generic feature of the pp and pA collisions.\nAlthough the production of multijets through the double parton scattering mechanism was investigated in several experiments [2\u20137] at pp, pp\u0304 colliders, the interpretation of the data is somewhat\nhampered by the need to model both the longitudinal and the transverse partonic correlations at\nthe same time. The studies of proton-nucleus collisions at LHC will provide a feasible opportunity to study separately the longitudinal and transverse correlations of partons in the nucleon as\nwell as to check the validity of the underlying picture of multiple collisions.\nIt is worth mentioning also that understanding of multiparton interactions is important for\nproper modeling of central pp collisions which dominate in the production of new particles and\nwhere such multijet interactions are enhanced. Such modeling should be done in a way consistent\nwith the information about the structure of nucleons/nuclei available from hard processes which\nwere studied at HERA. So far this is not the case (see below).\nThe simplest case of a multiparton process is the double parton collision. Since the momentum scale pt of a hard interaction corresponds to much smaller transverse distances \u223c 1/pt\nin the coordinate space than the hadronic radius, in a double parton collision the two interaction\nregions are well separated in the transverse space. Also in the c.m. frame pairs of partons from\nMPI08\n\n309\n\n\fthe colliding hadrons are located in pancakes of thickness \u2264 (1/x1 + 1/x2 )/pc.m. . Thus two\nhard collisions occur practically simultaneously as soon as x1 , x2 are not too small and hence a\ncross talk between two hard collisions is not possible. A consequence is that the different parton\nprocesses add incoherently in the cross section. The double parton scattering cross section, being\nproportional to the square of the elementary parton-parton cross section, is therefore characterized by a scale factor with dimension of the inverse of a length squared. The dimensional quantity\nis provided by the nonperturbative input to the process, namely by the multiparton distributions.\nIn fact, because of the localization of the interactions in transverse space, the two pairs of colliding partons are aligned, in such a way that the transverse distance between the interacting partons\nof the target hadron is practically the same as the transverse distance between the partons of the\nprojectile. The double parton distribution is therefore a function of two momentum fractions\nand of their transverse distance, and it can be written as \u0393(x, x\ufffd , \u03c1, \u03c1\ufffd ). It depends also on the\nvirtualities of the partons, Q2 , Q\ufffd2 , though to make the expressions more compact we will not\nwrite explicitly this Q2 dependence. Hence the double parton scattering cross section for the two\n\"two \u2192 two\" parton processes \u03b1 and \u03b2 in an inelastic interaction between hadrons a and b can\nbe written as:\n\ufffd\nm\n\u0393a (x1 , x2 ; \u03c11 , \u03c12 )\u03c3\u0302\u03b1 (x1 , x\ufffd1 ) * \u03c3\u0302\u03b2 (x2 , x\ufffd2 )\u0393b (x\ufffd1 , x\ufffd2 ; \u03c11 , \u03c12 )\n\u03c3D (\u03b1, \u03b2) =\n2\ndx1 dx\ufffd1 dx2 dx\ufffd2 d2 \u03c11 d2 \u03c12 ,\n(1)\nwhere m = 1 for indistinguishable parton processes and m = 2 for distinguishable parton\nprocesses. We also took into account that transverse distances in the binary collisions are small\nas compared to the hadron size scale. Note that though the factorization approximation of Eq.(1)\nis generally accepted in the analyses of the multijet processes and appears natural based on the\ngeometry of the process no formal proof exists in the literature.\nThe QCD factorization theorems for exclusive hard processes: \u03b3L\u2217 +p \u2192 \"vector meson +\np, \u03b3L\u2217 + p \u2192 \u03b3 + p give a unique tool for determining transverse distributions of partons in\nnucleons as a function of x and resolution scale - the generalized parton distribution (GPD).\nThe discussed processes are proportional to the GPDs in non-diagonal kinematics at finite longitudinal momentum transfer. However corrections for this effect are small and one can extract diagonal GPDs from the analysis of the data.They could be written as fj (x, Q2 , \u03c1) =\nfj (x, Q2 )Fj (x, Q2 , \u03c1), where fj (x, Q2 ) is the parton density and\n\ufffd the probability to find a parton\nwith given x at transverse distance \u03c1 from the nucleon center d2 \u03c1Fj (x, Q2 , \u03c1) = 1.\nCurrently, the best information about the gluon transverse distributions is provided by\nthe data on J/\u03c8 exclusive production: in the scaling limit d\u03c3/dt \u221d Fg2 (x, t). The analysis of\nthe experimental data indicates that dipole with Fg = 1/(1 \u2212 t/mg (x)2 ) with the x-dependent\nmg (x) gives a reasonable description of the data: m2g (x = 0.05) \u223c 1GeV 2 , m2g (x = 0.001) \u223c\n0.6GeV 2 .\nThe transverse distribution of partons is expressed through Fg (x, t) as\nFg (x, \u03c1; Q ) \u2261\n2\n\n310\n\n\ufffd\n\nd2 \u2206\u22a5 i(\u2206\u22a5 \u03c1)\ne\nFg (x, t = \u2212\u22062\u22a5 ; Q2 ).\n(2\u03c0)2\n\n(2)\n\nMPI08\n\n\fIn the case of the dipole parametrization one find\nFg (x, \u03c1) =\n\nm2g \ufffd mg \u03c1 \ufffd\nK1 (mg \u03c1),\n2\u03c0\n2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere K1 is the modified Bessel function.\n\nOur analysis of the data the transverse distribution of gluons indicates that it is significantly\nmore narrow than the one which would follow from the naive assumption that it should be the\nsame as given by the e.m. nucleon form factors. A likely reason for the difference of sizes is\nthat pion field which contributes significantly to the e.m. nucleon radius gives non-negligible\ncontribution to the gluon GPD only for x \u2264 0.1.\nThe distribution over \u03c1 also somewhat broadens with decrease of x with a initial broadening at x \u223c 0.05 due to the pion field effects. Also, there are indications that transverse distribution\nof quarks is somewhat broader than that for gluons, for the recent analysis and references see [9].\n\nDistribution over the impact parameters in pp collisions with production of jets is given by\nthe convolution of Fj\ufffd s (for simplicity we assume in the following that only gluons contribute to\nthe jet production:\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n2\nP2 (b) = d \u03c11 d2 \u03c12 \u03b4(2) (\u03c11 + \u03c12 \u2212 b)Fg (x1 , Q2 , \u03c11 ) * Fg (x2 , Q2 , \u03c12 ).\n(4)\nUsing parametrization of Eq.3 one finds\nm2g\nP2 (b) =\n12\u03c0\n\n\ufffd\n\nmg b\n2\n\n\ufffd3\n\nK3 (mg b)\n\n(5)\n\nIf partons \"i\" and \"j\" are not correlated in the transverse plane\n\u0393ij (x1 , x2 ; \u03c1, \u03c1\ufffd ) = Fi (x1 , \u03c1) * Fj (x2 , \u03c1\ufffd ),\n\n(6)\n\none can use P2 (b) to calculate the rate of the production of four jets in two binary collisions. This\ncross section is usually written as (we give here expression for the process studied by CDF [6]\nand D0 [7] of production three jets and a photon where combinatoric effect of identical collisions\nis absent)\nd\u03c3(p+p\u0304\u2192jet1 +jet2 +jet3 +\u03b3)\nd\u03a91,2,3,4\nd\u03c3(p+p\u0304\u2192jet1 +jet2 ) d\u03c3(p+p\u0304\u2192jet3 +\u03b3)\n*\nd\u03a91,2\nd\u03a93,4\n\n=\n\nf (x1 , x3 )f (x2 , x4 )\n,\n\u03c3ef f f (x1 )f (x2 )f (x3 )f (x4 )\n\n(7)\n\nwhere f (x1 , x3 ), f (x2 , x4 ) are longitudinal light-cone double parton densities and \u03c3ef f which\nmay depend on xi , pt is the \"transverse correlation area\". The CDF reported \u03c3ef f = 14.5 \u00b1\n1.7\n1.7+\n\u2212 2.3 mb [6]. The recent D0 analysis [7] reports \u03c3ef f = 15.1 \u00b1 1.9 mb which is very close\nto the CDF result. However there is a difference in the analyses - the D0 treatment is completely\ninclusive, while CDF was removing the events with extra jets. The correction for this extra\nselection may reduce the CDF result by about 35% [10]. Hence, a more detailed comparison\nof two data analyses is necessary. In the following we will use the value of \u03c3ef f = 14 mb for\nnumerical estimates.\nMPI08\n\n311\n\n\fOne can express \u03c3ef f through P2 (b) as\n\u03c3eff =\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\n\n2\n\nd b\n\n\ufffd\u22121\n\nP22 (b)\n\n=\n\n28\u03c0\n\u2248 34 mb.\nm2g\n\n(8)\n\nThis number is substantially larger than experimental result though it is smaller than a\nnaive estimate based on the e.m. form factor of the nucleon (\u223c 60 mb) 1 . A more than a factor\ntwo discrepancy between the data and Eq.8 implies presence of a strong transverse correlation\nbetween partons in the nucleon. Global fluctuations of the transverse size of nucleons may reduce\n\u03c3ef f by about \u223c 20% [11] as compared to Eq.8. Larger effects may arise from concentration of\ngluons near quarks (constituent quarks) - possible reduction of \u03c3ef f by a factor of about two [9].\nTogether these two effects may explain magnitude of \u03c3ef f observed by CDF and D0. Additional\neffect results from the process of the QCD evolution since the emitted partons are localized in a\nsmall transverse area near the parton involved in the dijet process. However this effect is relevant\nmostly for small enough x which were practically not covered by the CDF and D0 measurements.\nThough the data are consistent with the double parton distribution been a product of two\nsingle parton distributions it would be preferable to avoid need for making this assumption. Studies of proton (deuteron) - nucleus collisions would be very valuable for this purpose.\n2\n\nMultijet production in proton - nucleus collisions\n\nIn the case of scattering of a hadron off a nucleus the parton density of the nucleus does not\nchange noticeably on the scale of transverse size of the projectile hadron. Non-additive effects\nin the parton densities are known to be less than few % for 0.02 \u2264 x \u2264 0.5. Hence they\ncould be neglected for production of jets in this x interval (correction for these effects could be\neasily introduced). Therefore in this kinematics we have to take into account only transverse\ncorrelations of partons in individual nucleons of the nucleus.\nThus there are two different contributions to the double parton scattering cross section:\n1 + \u03c3 2 . The first one, \u03c3 D , interaction with two partons of the same nucleon in the\n\u03c3D = \u03c3D\n1\nD\nnucleus, is the same as for the nucleon target (the only difference being the enhancement of the\nparton flux) and the corresponding cross section is [8]\n\ufffd\n1\n\u03c3D\n= \u03c3D d2 BT (B) = A\u03c3D ,\n(9)\nwhere\nT (B) =\n\n\ufffd\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\ndz\u03c1A (r),\n\n\ufffd\n\nT (B)d2 B = A,\n\n(10)\n\nis the nuclear thickness, as a function of the impact parameter of the hadron-nucleus collision B.\nThe contribution to the term in \u0393A (x\ufffd1 , x\ufffd2 , \u03c1, ) due to the partons originated from different\n2 , can be calculated solely from the geometry of the process by observing\nnucleons of the target, \u03c3D\n1\n\nThe PYTHIA Monte Carlo reproduces the observed rate of multijet production assuming much more narrow\ndistribution of partons in \u03c1 than the one allowed by the measurements of the GPDs.\n\n312\n\nMPI08\n\n\fthat the nuclear\n\ufffd density does not change within a transverse scale \ufffdb\ufffd \ufffd RA . It rapidly increases\nwith A \u221d T 2 (B)d2 B. Taking \u03c3ef f reported by the CDF double scattering experiment [6]\nwe finds that the contribution of the second term should dominate in the case of proton - heavy\nnucleus collisions [8]:\n\ufffd \ufffd0.39\n\ufffd\n\u03c32\n(A \u2212 1)\nA\n2\n2\nR\u2261\n\u2248\n* \u03c3ef f T (b) d b \u2248 0.68 *\n.\n(11)\n2\n\u03c31 * A\nA\n12\n|A\u226512,\u03c3ef f \u223c14mb\nHence we predict the Antishadowing effect: for A=200, and \u03c3ef f =14 mb: \u03c3pA /\u03c3pp \u2248 4. The\neffect is linear in \u03c3ef f . Measurements with a set of nuclei would allow to measure the double\nparton distributions in nucleons and also to check the validity of the QCD factorization for such\nprocesses which appears natural but which so far was not derived in pQCD.\nRecently an event generator for the configurations in nuclei including short-range correlations was developed [12]. It allows to check the accuracy of Eq.11 for the number of collisions\nwhere partons from two different nucleons of the nucleus are involved. It was found that for\nA \u223c 200 the ratio R is reduced by \u223c 5%.\n\nAn important application of the discussed process would be to investigate transverse correlations between the nuclear partons in the shadowing region. This would require a selection of\nboth partons of the nucleus in the shadowing region, xA \u2264 xsh \u223c 10\u22122 . 2 Since the shadowing effect is larger at small B and since four jet events select smaller B than two jet events the\nantishadowing effect should be somewhat smaller in this case (for the same \u03c3ef f ).\nIt is possible to extend this analysis to the case of production of six jets. We find [8]:\n\ufffd\nT\n\u03c31 = \u03c3T d2 BT (B) = A\u03c3T ,\n\ufffd\n1\nT\nG(x1 , x2 , x3 )\u03c3\u0302(x1 , x\ufffd1 )\u03c3\u0302(x2 , x\ufffd2 )\u03c3\u0302(x3 , x\ufffd3 )dx1 dx\ufffd1 dx2 dx\ufffd2 dx3 dx\ufffd3\n\u03c32 =\n3!\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\u00d7 G(x\ufffd1 , x\ufffd2 )G(x\ufffd3 ) + G(x\ufffd2 , x\ufffd3 )G(x\ufffd1 ) + G(x\ufffd1 , x\ufffd3 )G(x\ufffd2 )\n\ufffd\n1\n\u00d7 d2 BT 2 (B) \ufffd ,\n\u03c3ef f\n\ufffd\n1\n\u03c33T =\nG(x1 , x2 , x3 )\u03c3\u0302(x1 , x\ufffd1 )G(x\ufffd1 )G(x\ufffd2 )G(x\ufffd3 )\n3!\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\u00d7\u03c3\u0302(x2 , x2 )\u03c3\u0302(x3 , x3 )dx1 dx1 dx2 dx2 dx3 dx3 . d2 BT 3 (B).\n(12)\n\n2\nThe estimate using assumption that \u03c31 \u221d 1/\u03c3ef\nf leads to prediction of a factor \u223c 12 large\nantishadowing for the scattering off heavy nuclei:\n\n\u03c31 : \u03c32 : \u03c33 = 1 : 1.45 * (A/10)0.5 : 0.25(A/10) \u2192 1 : 6.5 : 5.\n\n(13)\n\nIt is worth noting that studying associated hadron production in central region, nuclear\nfragmentation in the multijet events would provide additional interesting information. Indeed,\n2\n\nThe A-dependence of the ratio of \u03c32 /\u03c31 in the kinematics where only one of the nuclear partons has xA \u2264 xsh\nis practically the same as for the case when both nuclear partons have x \u2265 xsh .\n\nMPI08\n\n313\n\n\ffour (six) jet events are due to much more central collisions than minimal bias pA collisions.\nAs a result one expects for moderate x1p , x2p \u2264 0.3 an increase of the central multiplicity,\nlarger rate of forward neutron production, etc. At the same time a new physics is possible for\nx1p + x2p \u2265 0.7 since such a trigger may start to select configurations in the proton with fewer\ngluons and also of probably of a smaller transverse size? Another interesting limit is when one\nx's is moderate, while a leading hadron with moderate pt few GeV/c is detected. In this case\none pair of jets serves as a trigger for centrality, while the presence / suppression of the leading\nhadron measures effect of fractional energy losses in the black disk limit [15].\n3\n\nMultijet production in photon - nucleus collisions\n\nThe pA collisions at the LHC are probably rather far in the future. At the same time there\nappears to be another opportunity to study multiple collisions with nuclei which will be available\nas soon as the heavy ion program will start. It comes from the possibility to study ultraperipheral\ncollisions of nuclei where two nuclei pass each other at large impact parameters. In this case\ndirect strong interactions are not possible though interaction via emission of the photon by one\nof the nucleus (which is left practically intact) is possible, has a large cross section and can\nbe experimentally separated from the ordinary heavy ion collisions, see review in [13]. This\nwill allow to measure multiparton photon wave function without need to model nucleon wave\nfunction via study of the A-dependence of the multijet production. Using information about\nsimilar collisions in \u03b3p collisions available at HERA it will be possible to measure reliably \u03c3ef f\nfor different configurations of partons in the photon wave function. For example, for the photon\ncomponent containing heavy quarks the transverse size is \u221d 1/mQ is much smaller than the\nnucleon size, leading to \u03c3ef f determined solely by the nucleon structure. Though \u03c3ef f in this\ncase is significantly smaller than for pp collisions, the antishadowing effect is likely to be large\nenough to perform the analysis of the correlations of partons in the photon and allow a more\nreliable determination of \u03c3ef f for \u03b3 \u2212 p collisions..\nIt would be interesting also to study the gap survival probability for \u03b3A scattering with\nproduction of one or two pairs of jets with one of the jets of each pair in the photon fragmentation\nregion and another one (two) across the gap. This would probe both the multiparton structure\nof the photon and the probability of the dipole to pass through the nucleus without inelastic\ninteractions. An important advantage of the photon is that there are several handles to regulate\nthe transverse size of the components in the photon wave function involved in the process. For\nexample, one can select events with different x\u03b3 , with leading D-mesons, etc.\n\nThe simplest process which allows to track propagation of a small dipole through the\nstrong gluon fields in the nuclei is the process \u03b3 + A \u2192 vector meson + rapidity gap + X in\nthe kinematics where t = (p\u03b3 \u2212 pV M )2 is large [14]. In the rest frame of the nucleus\u221athe\nprocess corresponds to a transformation of \u03b3 to a a q q\u0304 pair of a small transverse size \u221d 1/ \u2212t\nwhich interacts with a target through a two gluon ladder. If the gluon fields are strong enough\nthe interaction would approach the black disk regime of complete absorption. In this limit it is\nimpossible for a dipole to pass though the nucleus at small impact parameters without additional\ninelastic interactions. This would reduce the A-dependence of the process from \u221d A to \u221d A1/3 .\nSince the gluon fields increase with increase of energy one expects a significant deviation of the\nA-dependence from \u221d A in the LHC kinematics. The rate of the process is sufficiently high to\n314\n\nMPI08\n\n\fobserve it during the first heavy ion run [14]. Note also that this process has several practical\nadvantages as compared to he case of coherent J/\u03c8 production. Production of hadrons in wide\nrange of rapidities make it easier to trigger on these events. Also, location of the gap allows to\ndetermine on the event by event basis which of the nuclei emitted a photon. As a result it will be\n\u221a\n\u221a\nfeasible to study the dipole - nucleus interactions up to s\u03b3p \u223c 1 TeV as compared to s\u03b3p \u223c\n0.2 TeV for the coherent case.\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nTheoretical analysis of the exclusive hard phenomena studied at HERA produced a unique information about the transverse structure of nucleon. When combined with the information from\nthe experimental studies of multiparton interactions at Tevatron, it leads to the unambigous conclusion that large transverse correlations between partons are present in the nucleon. Study of\nmultiparton interactions with nuclei will allow to separate longitudinal and transverse correlations of partons in nucleons and photons. In the near future such studies will be possible in the\nultraperipheral photon - lead collisions at the LHC. Similar studies can be done at RHIC in the\ndeuteron - gold collisions if acceptance of detectors is increased. It appears that the fastest way to\nestablish how black are interactions of small dipoles at ultra high energies will be a study of the\nrapidity gap events with large t in UPC heavy ion collisions. Studies of the leading jet production\nin the UPC will also allow to investigate the regime of fractional energy losses in the proximity\nof the black disk regime.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the DOE grant DE-FGO2 93ER40771.

Heavy-quarks are a powerful probe for the detailed\ninvestigation of the QGP properties. In this paper we review recent results from RHIC on open and hidden heavy-flavor hadron production\nand their interaction with the QCD matter on the partonic level.\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nHigh-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory allow exploring strongly interacting matter at very high temperatures\nand energy density. QCD matter at these conditions is expected to form a system of deconfined\nquarks and gluons, the so-called Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), if the critical energy density (\ufffdc \u223c\n0.7 GeV/fm3 ) is exceeded. The goal of relativistic heavy-ion physics is to study the properties of\nthe QGP under laboratory controlled conditions [1, 2].\nThe results from RHIC have given evidence that the nuclear matter created in such collisions exhibits properties consistent with the QGP formation [3]. In particular, measurements\nof the momentum distribution of emitted particles and comparison with hydro-dynamic model\ncalculations have shown that the outwards steaming particles move collectively, with the patterns\narising from variations of pressure gradients early after the collision. This phenomenon, called\nelliptic flow, is analogous to the properties of fluid motion. The flow results suggest that color\ndegrees of freedom carried by quarks and gluons are present in the produced medium, which\nflow with negligible shear viscosity. Thus, the QCD matter produced at RHIC behaves like a\nperfect liquid. Moreover, it has been found that the matter remaining in the collision zone is\nextremely opaque to the passage of partons from hard scattering processes in the initial state of\nthe collisions. These traversing partons are believed to lose energy via gluon Bremsstrahlung in\nthe medium before fragmenting into hadrons.\nA detailed and quantitative understanding of the parton energy loss in the medium is one\nof the intriguing issues which currently needs to be addressed. The study of heavy-flavor (charm,\nbottom) production in heavy-ion collisions provides key tests of the parton energy loss mechanisms and offers important information on the properties of the produced medium [4]. Due to\ntheir large mass (m > 1 GeV/c2 ), heavy quarks are expected to be primarily produced in the initial stage of the collision and, therefore, probe the complete space-time evolution of the medium.\n\u2020\n\nE-mail: a.mischke@uu.nl\n\nMPI08\n\n317\n\n\fB/(B+D)\n\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n\ne-D0 (PYTHIA fit)\nSTAR\ne-D0 (MC@NLO fit)\ne-h, Run5 (PYTHIA fit)\ne-h, Run6 (PYTHIA fit)\nPHENIX e-h, Run5+6 (PYTHIA fit), prel.\nFONLL\n\npreliminary\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\np+p @ s = 200 GeV\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\np (GeV/c)\nT\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 1: (a) Nuclear modification factor RAA (averaged above pT > 3 GeV/c) of heavy-flavor decay electrons as\n\u221a\nsNN =\n\na function of collision centrality (quantified in Npart ) in Au+Au and minimum bias Cu+Cu collisions at\n\n200 GeV. (b) Relative bottom contribution to the total yield of heavy-flavor decay electrons derived from e\u2212D0 and\ne\u2212hadron azimuthal angular correlations, compared to the uncertainty band from a FONLL calculation.\n\nTheoretical models predicted that heavy quarks should experience smaller energy loss than light\nquarks while propagating through the QCD medium due to the suppression of small angle gluon\nradiation, the so-called dead-cone effect [5, 6].\n2\n\nProbing the QCD medium with heavy quarks\n\nNuclear effects are typically quantified using the nuclear modification factor RAA where the particle yield in Au+Au collisions is divided by the yield in pp reactions scaled by the number of\nbinary collisions. RAA = 1 would indicate that no nuclear effects, such as Cronin effect, shadowing or gluon saturation, are present and that nucleus-nucleus collisions can be considered as\na incoherent superposition of nucleon-nucleon interactions. Charm and bottom quarks can be\nidentified by assuming that isolated electrons in the event stem from semi-leptonic decays of\nheavy-quark mesons. At high transverse momentum (pT ), this mechanism of electron production is dominant enough to reliably subtract other sources of electrons like conversions from\nphotons and \u03c0 0 Dalitz decays. Fig. 1(a) shows the average RAA for heavy-flavor decay electrons\n\u221a\nin Au+Au collisions at sNN = 200 GeV as a function of participating nucleons (Npart ) measured by the STAR and PHENIX experiments [7, 8]. The data are consistent with each other,\nand the RAA shows an increasing suppression from peripheral to central Au+Au collisions. The\nminimum bias Cu+Cu data fit into this systematics. The strong suppression for the most central\nAu+Au collisions indicates an unexpectedly large energy loss of heavy quarks in the medium in\ncontradiction to expect ions from the dead-cone effect. Surprisingly, the measured RAA of 0.2 is\nsimilar to the one observed for light-quark hadrons. Current models with reasonable model parameters overpredict the observed suppression [7, 8]. The data is described reasonably well if the\nbottom contribution to the electrons is assumed to be small. Therefore, the observed discrepancy\n318\n\nMPI08\n\n\fcould indicate that the B dominance over D mesons starts at higher pT than expected. A possible\nscenario for heavy-quark meson suppression invokes collisional dissociation in the medium [9].\nThe measurement of the relative charm and bottom contributions to the heavy-flavor decay\nelectrons (also called non-photonic electrons) is essential for the interpretation of the electron\nspectra and nuclear modification factor. Azimuthal angular correlations between non-photonic\nelectrons and hadrons allow to identify the underlying production process [10]. The relative\nbottom contribution B/(B+D) to the non-photonic electrons is extracted from the e\u2212hadron and\ne\u2212D 0 azimuthal correlation distributions [11]. Figure 1(b) shows the B/(B + D) ratio together\nwith a prediction from calculations of heavy-flavor production in pp collisions at Fixed-Order\nplus Next-to-Leading Logarithm (FONLL) level [12]. These data provide convincing evidence\nthat bottom contributes significantly (\u223c50%) to the non-photonic electron yields above pT =\n5 GeV/c. Further studies have to show whether these results imply substantial suppression of\nbottom production at high pT in the produced medium. An important step to answer this question\nwill be the direct measurement of open charmed mesons and the identification of B mesons via\ndisplaced electrons using the detector upgrades of the STAR and PHENIX experiments.\n3\n\nDissociation of quarkonium states in the hot and dense QCD medium\n\nThe dissociation of quarkonia due to color-screening in a QGP is a classic signature of deconfinement in relativistic heavy-ion collisions [13, 14], where the sequential suppression of the\nquarkonia states, such as \u03a5, \u03a5\ufffd and \u03a5\ufffd\ufffd , depends on the temperature of the surrounding medium,\nthus providing a QCD thermometer.\n3.1\n\nJ/\u03c8 measurements\n\nResults from the PHENIX experiment have shown that the centrality dependence of the suppres\u221a\nsion of the J/\u03c8 yield in sNN = 200 GeV Au+Au collisions is similar to that observed at the\n\u221a\nCERN-SPS accelerator ( sNN = 17.3 GeV) [16], even though the energy density reached in collisions at RHIC is about a factor of 2-3 higher (cf. Fig. 2(a)). Moreover, it has be observed that\nthe J/\u03c8 yield in the forward rapidity region is more suppression than the one at mid-rapidity,\nwhich might be explained by cold nuclear absorption.\nTheoretical prediction based on string theory application of AdS/CFT suggests that the\neffective J/\u03c8 dissociation temperature is expected to decrease with pT [15]. This conjecture is\ndifferent from the predictions of more traditional screening models where the suppression due\nto screening vanishes towards higher pT . Recent RAA measurements for J/\u03c8 in Cu+Cu colli\u221a\nsions at sNN = 200 GeV from the STAR [17] and PHENIX experiments [18] are compared in\nFig. 2(b). The RAA is suppressed at low pT (around 1 GeV/c), and the data suggest that RAA increases with increasing pT and reaches unity around 5 GeV/c, although the large errors currently\npreclude strong conclusions. This result is in contradiction with expectations from AdS/CFT\nbased models and the Two-Component-Approach model [19], which predicts a suppression at\nhigh pT . These results could indicate that other J/\u03c8 production mechanisms that counter the\nsuppression such as recombination and formation-time effects might play a more dominant role\nat higher pT .\nThe large signal-to-background ratio (\u223c3) of the J/\u03c8 in pp collisions (cf.

Figure 3(b) illustrates the azimuthal angular correlations between high-pT J/\u03c8 (pT > 5 GeV/c) and charged hadrons (pT > 0.5 GeV/c).\nNotably, no significant correlation yield is observed on the near-side (\u2206\u03c6 \u223c 0 rad), which is not\nin line with earlier results from di-hadron correlation measurements [3]. Since corresponding\nPYTHIA simulations (also depicted in Fig. 3(b) as the dashed histogram) show a strong nearside correlation peak from J/\u03c8 from B decays (B \u2192 J/\u03c8 + X), the experimental results can\nbe used to estimate the B feed-down contribution to the inclusive J/\u03c8 yield at pT > 5 GeV/c. It\nwas found to be 17\u00b13% in the studied pT range [17].\n3.2\n\nFirst \u03a5 measurements in nuclear collisions\n\nThe golden decay channel for the \u03a5 reconstruction is the decay into electron pairs \u03a5 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 .\nThe STAR detector with its large acceptance (|\u03b7| < 1 and 0 < \u03c6 < 2\u03c0) and excellent trigger\ncapabilities combined with a very good electron identification is very well suited for \u03a5 measurements in nuclear collisions. The first preliminary measurements of the \u03a5 invariant mass in\n\u221a\nAu+Au collisions at sNN = 200 GeV are presented in [20] and shows a significant \u03a5 signal.\nThe \u03a5 production cross-section in pp collisions is BRee \u00d7 d\u03c3\ndy y=0 = 91\u00b128(stat.)\u00b122(sys.)pb.\nThis measurement follows the world data trend and shows, within uncertainties, very good agreement with NLO calculations [21].

The nuclear modification factor (RAA ) of J/\u03c8 in Cu+Cu collisions\nincreases from low to high pT and reaches unity for pT > 5 GeV/c. This result is about 2\u03c3\nabove the RAA at low pT (< 4 GeV/c) and is consistent with no J/\u03c8 suppression. First RHIC\nresults on the \u03a5 production in nuclear collisions are promising and show that the suppression\nmeasurements will be possible in the near future.\nAcknowledgments\nThe author would like to thank the organizers for the intellectual stimulating atmosphere during\nthe conference.

Estienne1\n1 SUBATECH, Ecole des mines, Universit\u00e9 de Nantes, CNRS/IN2P3\n4 rue Alfred Kastler - BP 20722, 44307 Nantes Cedex 3, FRANCE\nAbstract\nA modification of the internal structure of jets is expected due to the\nproduction of a dense QCD medium, the Quark Gluon Plasma, in\nheavy-ion collisions. We discuss some aspects of jet reconstruction in\np + p and A + A collisions and emphasize the dramatically increased\ncontribution of the underlying event in nucleus-nucleus collisions as\ncompared with the vacuum case. We conclude with its consequences\non the full jet spectrum and fragmentation function extraction at LHC.\n1\n1.1\n\nMotivations for jet studies\nThe phenomenon of jet energy loss in heavy-ion collisions\n\nNon-perturbative lattice QCD calculations indicate that a deconfined state of matter, the Quark\nGluon Plasma (QGP), may exist at very high temperatures and energy densities. This state of\nmatter is expected to be formed in the heart of an ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collision, when\nthe energy density is the largest. Since 2000, the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) has\ncollected impressive results, which has led to the discovery of a new state-of-matter of very small\nviscosity [1]. Among the observables which have led to such a conclusion, the jet quenching\neffect is one of the most relevant as it has highlighted the production of a dense medium in\ninteraction. One of the first computations of the radiative energy loss of high-energy quarks in\na dense medium was proposed by Gyulassy et al. [2, 3] in the early nineties. Since then many\napproaches have been developed to determine the gluon radiation spectrum of a hard parton\nundergoing multiple scattering [4\u20137]. The experimental consequence of these processes is a\nsignificant suppression of large transverse momentum (pT ) hadrons in heavy-ion collisions (HIC)\nhighlighted through the measurement of the nuclear modification factor or two and three particle\ncorrelations [8, 9]. Even though we can nowadays claim that a dense medium has indeed been\nproduced and somehow characterized, a plethora of questions remains: does energy loss result\nfrom few strong scatterings in the medium or multiple soft ones ? How does it depend on the\nmedium-length ? What is the energy loss probability distribution of the partons ? They motivate\nthe necessity to call for some more discriminating, and differential observables to characterize\nthe QGP.\nMoreover, the \"leading particle\" physics which has been studied at RHIC until 2008\npresents some limitations known as surface and trigger biases [10,11]. Ideally, the analysis of reconstructed jets on an event by event basis should increase the sensitivity to medium parameters\nby reducing the trigger bias and improve our knowledge of the original parton 4-momentum.\nMPI08\n\n323\n\n\f1.2\n\nJets in a heavy-ion collision and the Underlying Event background\n\nIn QCD, jets are defined as cascades of partons emitted from an initial hard scattering followed\nby fragmentation. In HIC, parton fragmentation is modified relative to the vacuum, due to the\npresence of the hot QCD medium. After the overlap of the two incoming nuclei, the quarks and\ngluons produced in the initial nucleon-nucleon (N + N ) hard scatterings propagate through the\ndense color field generated by the soft part of the event. Consequently, the medium should affect\nthe fragmentation process of hard partons and has drastic effects on the jet structure itself. (i)\nA softening of the fragmentation function is expected leading to the suppression of production\nof high pT particles as well as a numerous production of soft particles. A first attempt to model\nmedium-modification fragmentation processes by Borghini & Wiedemann was the determination\nof the single inclusive hadron spectrum inside jet - known as Hump-Backed Plateau (HBP) - in\nHIC [12]. This aspect will be addressed in section 4 at the level of the experiment. (ii) A jet\nbroadening (inducing out-of-cone radiations) is expected as one should observe a redistribution\nof the particles inside the jet relatively to its axis. A modification of the transverse shape of the jet\n(kT spectrum) or its particle angular distribution can be studied [13]. (iii) In case of sufficiently\nstrong energy loss scenarii, it could have consequences on the jet reconstruction itself and reduce\nthe expected jet rate. (iv) As di-jet pairs have different path lengths in medium and as energy loss\nis a stochastic process, the di-jet energy imbalance should be increased and acoplanarity induced.\nIdeally, a direct measurement of these modifications should be possible. However, the\npicture is more complicated due to the presence of the soft Underlying Event (UE). The UE and\nits fluctuations will induce important bias on the jet identification. It will be extensively discussed\nin section 3. The expected jet reconstruction performances in p + p in the ALICE experiment are\nfirst discussed in section 2. Note that the jet energy-scale, one of the main sources of uncertainty\nin any jet spectrum measurement will not be discussed here. ATLAS and CMS results will not\nbe commented either. More information can be found elsewhere [14].\n2\n\nJet reconstruction performances with calorimetry\n\n2.1\n\nExperimental apparatus and tools\n\nFull jet measurement in heavy-ion experiments has become possible very recently thanks to the\ninsertion of an electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC) in the STAR experiment at RHIC [15, 16].\nSTAR has demonstrated the feasibility of such measurement combining its charged particle momentum information from its Time Projection Chamber (TPC) and the neutral one from the EMC,\npublishing the first measurement of the inclusive jet spectrum for the process p + p (both polar\u221a\nized) \u2192 jet + X at s = 200 GeV with a 0.2 pb\u22121 integrated luminosity [15]. The spectrum of\npure power law shape is in agreement with NLO calculations (within the error bars).\nAs STAR, ALICE is a multipurpose heavy-ion experiment [17]. Its central barrel mainly equipped\nof a large TPC and a silicium inner tracking system covers a full azimuthal acceptance but is\nlimited to the midrapididity region (|\u03b7| < 0.9). It has a large pT coverage (\u223c 100 MeV/c to \u223c\n100 GeV/c) with a \u03b4pT /pT resolution of few percents (still below 6% at 100 GeV/c) [10]. The capabilities of ALICE to disentangle particles down to very low pT , where strong modifications of\nthe fragmentation function are expected, should lead to a very precise measurement of the number\nof particles inside a jet. More recently, the insertion of an electromagnetic calorimeter to collect\n324\n\nMPI08\n\n\fpart of the neutral information and to improve the trigger capabilities of ALICE has been accepted\nas an upgrade. The EMCal is a Pb-scintillator\u221a\nsampling EMC (|\u03b7| < 0.7, 80\u25e6 < \u03c6 < 190\u25e6 ) with\na design energy resolution of \u2206E/E = 11%/ E and a radiation length of \u223c 20 X0 [18]. It contains \u223c13k towers in Shashlik geometry with a quite high granularity (\u2206\u03b7\u00d7\u2206\u03c6 = 0.014\u00d70.014).\nThe official ALICE jet finder is a UA1 based cone algorithm which has been modified in order\nto include the neutral information during the jet finding procedure.\n2.2\n\nJet signal degradation and energy resolution in p + p collisions\n\nErec (GeV)\n\n100\n80\n60\n40\nJETAN: Charged + neutral, No pT cut\n\n20\n0\n\nJETAN: Charged + neutral, 1 GeV/c pT cut\nJETAN: Charged only, 1 GeV/c pT cut\n\nM.

The markers shows the result from a full\nsimulation. Right: cone energy of 100 \u00b1 5 GeV fully simulated jets vs R for the three cases described in the text.\n\nJet reconstruction is highly influenced by the high multiplicity of an event and by the\ncharged-to-neutral fluctuations for jets in which the neutral fraction (or part of it) can not be\nmeasured. Due to its detector configuration, ALICE will be able to reconstruct two types of\njets. Using the charged particle momentum information, the production of charged jets will be\nstudied. As the charged particle plus EMCal configuration is almost blind to neutrons and KL0 ,\nALICE will also measure charged+neutral jets but will miss part of the neutral energy. In both\ncases and in elementary collisions, the charged-to-neutral fluctuations which dominate will give\nrise to a low energy tail in the reconstructed jet energy. Such effects should be enlarged by limited\ndetector acceptance and inefficiency and analysis cuts which cause other types of fluctuations. To\nget a basic and qualitative understanding of the signal fluctuations for jets reconstructed in p + p\ncollisions at LHC, we have undertaken a fast simulation of 100 \u00b1 5 GeV jets using PYTHIA\nas event generator for different cuts and detector configurations. Such features are illustrated in\nFig. 1 (left) which shows the distribution of the jet energy reconstructed in a cone of radius R\nand compared with the result from a full detector simulation described below.\nJets were first reconstructed with a simple jet finder available in PYTHIA (PYCELL) with\nR = 1 using the momentum and energy information from charged and neutral particles (neutrons\nand KL0 excluded) (full black line). For the sample of simulated events which include detector\nMPI08\n\n325\n\n\facceptance cuts and reconstructed track inefficiency (not studied separately here), keeping R=1\nfor the jet reconstruction, one or several of the leading jet particles are not reconstructed and do\nnot contribute to the cone energy. It leads to its broadening and a low energy tail (red dashed\ncurve). The use of a limited cone radius during the jet finding procedure enhances collimated\njets and also leads to a low energy tail of the cone energy distribution (black dashed line). The\nfull red curve shows the combination of all the effects on the reconstructed jet energy keeping\nthe jets which center falls inside the EMCal acceptance. The reconstructed energy results in an\nalmost gaussian response function of resolution defined as \u2206E/E = r.m.s./ < E > of \u223c 33%.\nIt can be improved selecting only the jets fully contained in the EMCal as discussed below.\nALICE, Pythia Jets 100 GeV - Mid-rapidity (p+p ; 14 TeV) - Full simulation\n\nALICE Pythia Simulation ; Jets 95-105 GeV ; p+p at\n\n0.9\nJETAN: Charged only\n\n0.7\n\nJETAN: Charged + Neutral\n\n0.6\n\nJETAN: C + N, no pT cut\n\n\u0394E/E\n\n0.8\n\nResolution\n\ns NN = 14 TeV\n\n0.44\n\n\u03b7 fixed\n\n0.42\n\n0.4\n\n0.38\n\n0.5\n0.36\n\n0.4\n0.34\n\n0.3\n\n0.32\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.1\n0\n\nM.

The \u00b15 GeV uncertainty on the simulated\njet energy will be implicit below. Figure 1 (right) presents the cone energy reconstructed vs cone\nradius in three experimental conditions: with charged particles only and 1 GeV/c pT cut on their\nmomentum (circles), with charged plus EMCal configuration and 1 GeV/c pT cut (squares) and\nwith charged plus EMCal without pT cut. The error bars are the r.m.s. of the energy distributions.\nFigure 2 (left) shows the same study but for the resolution. As already discussed, reconstructing\njets from charged particles only enhances the number of jets with a larger than average charged\nparticle fraction. Increasing R of course increases the mean reconstructed energy and improves\nthe resolution but one reconstructs at best an energy below 50% of the input energy. These\ncharged-to-neutral fluctuations lead to a resolution of \u223c 40% for R = 0.4, improved to 30% by\nthe inclusion of neutral particles in the jet finding procedure. For R = 1, in the case charged +\nneutral without pT cut, the resolution is at best of 20% but part of the neutral information is lost\nas the jet is not fully collected within the calorimeter. The impact of the finite energy resolution\non the full reconstructed jet spectrum will be quickly discussed in section 4.1.\nThe limited EMCal acceptance effect on the resolution of the reconstructed jet energy has\nbeen studied previously [19]. We have shown that as long as the jet center is taken inside the\nEMCal, even if part of its energy is outside it, the resolution is still close to 30%. As long as\n326\n\nMPI08\n\n\fthe center of the jet can be taken outside the EMCal acceptance, the resolution degrades and\nasymptotically reaches the charged particles only case in the full TPC acceptance (Fig. 2 (right)).\n3\n3.1\n\nThe underlying event in A + A collisions\nThe background in A + A collisions\n\nJet reconstruction in HI collisions is more complicated than in elementary systems as the UE\ndramatically changes. The reconstruction is dominated by the influence of the high multiplicity.\nA rough assessment of the energy of the UE inside R = 1 at RHIC based on dET /d\u03b7 = 660 GeV\nat mid-rapidity [20] gives EU E = 1/(2\u03c0) \u00d7 \u03c0R2 \u00d7 dET /d\u03b7 \u223c 330 GeV. A linear or logarithmic\nextrapolation of the charged particle rapidity density from the available data at FOPI, SPS and\nRHIC [20] allows to estimate an EU E between 500 GeV and 1.5 TeV at LHC. In the extreme case,\nthe UE is a 4-fold higher than at RHIC however the growth of the cross-section for hard processes\nis more dramatic. The substantial enhancement in the jet cross-section significantly improves the\nkinematics reached for jet measurement at LHC allowing the reconstruction of high-energy jets\nabove the uncorrelated background on an event by event basis with good statistics.\nNot only the multiplicity differs from p+p collisions but the physics phenomena. First, the\nsimple fact that the impact parameter varies event-by-event for a given centrality class implies\nsome fluctuations in the UE (\u221d R2 ). All the well known correlations to the reaction plane\nand the azimuthal correlations between two and three particles at momenta below 10 GeV/c\ndrag some structures inside what can be denoted as background for our jet studies. They are\nregion-to-region fluctuations and are proportional to R. Moreover, the main sources of region-toregion fluctuations are the Poissonian fluctuations of uncorrelated particles also proportional to\nR. To optimize the jet identification efficiency, the signal energy has to be much larger than the\nbackground fluctuations \u2206Ebckg . The energy of the UE and its fluctuations inside a given cone\ncan be considerably reduced by simply reducing R in the jet finding procedure and applying a 1 or\n2 GeV/c pT cut on charged hadrons [10, 21]. However, they both imply some signal fluctuations\nwhose effects have been discussed above. The jet finding procedure in a HI environment is\nthus essentially based on two steps. First, a pT cut and a limited R are applied. Then, during\nthe iteration procedure in the jet finding algorithm which has been optimized accordingly, the\nremaining energy of the UE outside the jet cone is estimated statistically or event by event and is\nsubtracted from the energy of the jet inside its area at each iteration. Note that the use of a pT cut\nis potentially dangerous for a quenching measurement [16] so that new background subtraction\ntechnics based on jet areas should be prefered and investigated to improve our measurement [22].\n3.2\n\nUnderstand the background fluctuations\n\nThe validity of our background subtraction procedure applied in the EMCal acceptance has been\n\u221a\ntested on three simulated data sets [23]. The full PYTHIA simulation of 100 GeV jets at s =\n14 TeV has been used to mimic p+p collisions. Similarly, we processed full Minbias and Central\n\u221a\nHIJING simulations at sN N = 5.5 TeV to reproduce P b + P b events at LHC in the EMCal\nacceptance in which we embed PYTHIA events to simulate the hard processes. The small change\nin the event multiplity between p+p and P b+P b Minbias collisions does not extensively increase\nthe fluctuations in Minbias, unlike Central compared with Minbias where a factor of 4 \u2212 5 in the\nMPI08\n\n327\n\n\f350\n\n250\n\nM=-1.9+/-0.0\nrms=2.1+/-0.0\n\n150\n\n100\n\n100\n\n50\n\n50\n\nMinbias\n\nM=-1.4+/-0.0\n\n250\n\n150\n\n250\n\n250\n\nrms=1.6+/-0.0\n\nM=-1.2+/-0.1\n200\n\nTrue\n\n100\n\n50\n\n50\n\n0\n-50 -40 -30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40 50\n\nEst\n\nIdeal\n\n0\n-50 -40 -30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40 50\n\nEst\n\nRand\n\nCounts\n\nEBkg - EBgk\n\n140\n\nrms=4.0+/-0.1\n\n150\n\nEBkg - EBgk\n\n160\n\nM=-1.3+/-0.1\n\nrms=3.2+/-0.1\n\n100\n\n10 20 30 40 50\n\nMinbias\n\n200\n\n150\n\n200\n\n200\n\n0\n-50 -40 -30 -20 -10 0\n\nMinbias\n\nCentral\n\nM=-0.7+/-0.1\nrms=3.3+/-0.1\n\n0\n-50 -40 -30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40 50\n\nEst\n\nTrue\n\nEBkg - E Bgk\n\nCounts\n\n300\n\n300\n\n70\n60\n\nM=0.8+/-0.2\nCentral\n\nEst\n\nEBkg - EBgk\n\nCounts\n\np+p\n\nCounts\n\nCounts\n\nCounts\n\nCounts\n\n350\n\nM=1.0+/-0.2\n\n60\n\nrms=7.2+/-0.1\n\nCentral\n\nrms=9.6+/-0.2\n\n50\n120\n\n50\n\n100\n\n40\n\n80\n\n40\n30\n\n30\n\n60\n20\n\n20\n\n10\n\n10\n\n40\n20\n0\n-50 -40 -30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40 50\nIdeal\n\nEst\n\nEBkg - EBgk\n\n0\n-50 -40 -30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40 50\nEst\nERand\nBkg - E Bgk\n\n0\n-50 -40 -30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40 50\nEst\nETrue\nBkg - EBgk\n\nX\nEst\nX\nFig. 3: Ebgk\n\u2212 Ebgk\nfor p + p, P b + P b Minbias and Central collisions obtained from a full ALICE simulation.

One can estimate the variations\nX \u2212 E Est\nof fluctuations between Minbias and Central knowing the p + p case. \u2206EBkg = EBkg\nBkg\nhas been estimated from three different methods X, using an (\u03b7, \u03c6) grid filled with the HIJING\nparticle information output where the background energy inside a cone of radius R is estimated\nby summing the energy (i) of all cells inside the grid and scaling the total energy to the jet\ncone size (X = Ideal) ; (ii) inside the cone taken randomly in the grid (X = Rand) ; (iii)\ninside the cone centered on the jet axis (beforehand found by the jet finder) (X = T rue). The\ndistributions are presented in the 6 right pannels of Fig. 3 for the Ideal (left), Rand (center)\nand T rue (right) cases respectively, and for Minbias (top) and Central (bottom) collisions. The\nsame exercise has been applied on a grid only filled with p + p events. The distribution of\nT rue \u2212 E Est is presented in the most left hand panel. The mean value obtained\n\u2206EBkg = EBkg\nBkg\nfor the distributions of Minbias data are systematically negative. Clearly the jet algorithm overestimates the background compared with the three cases due to out-of-cone signal fluctuations\nwhich does dominate as emphasized in the p + p case. Going from the Ideal to the T rue case,\nthe region-to-region fluctuation effects increase the r.m.s. These fluctuations are less pronounced\nin the Ideal case which gives a mean value of the background event by event. From Minbias to\nCentral data, a factor of 2 \u2212 2.2 in the r.m.s. is observed, as expected, validating our background\nsubtraction method. In Central, the fluctuations are thus dominated by the event multiplicity.\nIt is indeed observed in the mean values which become positive with a large positive tail from\nthe Ideal to the T rue cases. In Central data, the background is thus under-estimated by the jet\nalgorithm so that the final cone energy is over-estimated.\n328\n\nMPI08\n\n\fExpected performances in P b + P b collisions at LHC\n\n< (E\n\nT,truth\n\n- ET,reco) / E\n\nT,truth\n\n>\n\n0.6\n0.5\n\nPb+Pb Central: pT,cut = 2 GeV/c (charges) && 0.4 GeV/c (neutrals) - R=0.4\nPb+Pb Minbias: pT,cut = 2 GeV/c (charges) && 0.4 GeV/c (neutrals) - R=0.4\np+p: pT,cut = 2 GeV/c (charges) && 0.4 GeV/c (neutrals) - R=0.4\np+p: pT,cut = 0 GeV/c (charges) && 0.4 GeV/c (neutrals) - R=0.4\np+p: pT,cut = 0 GeV/c (charges) && 0.4 GeV/c (neutrals) - R=0.7\np+p: No pT,cut - R=0.7\n\n300\n\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\nT,cut\n\np+p\nMinbias\n\n0.4\n0.3\n\nALICE, Pythia 100\np GeV\n=2GeV/c\nMono Jets\n(charges)\n- Mid-rapidity\n& 0.4GeV/c\n(p+p ; 14 TeV)\n(neutrals),\n- Full simulation\nR=0.4\n\n250\n\n# Entries\n\n3.3\n\nCentral\n\n200\n150\n100\n50\nM.

The Minbias and Central P b + P b cases are compared\nwith the p + p one for which a systematic study of the analysis cuts has also been performed. Jets\nhave been reconstructed using the ALICE UA1 cone finder including both charged and neutral\nparticles. The efficiency obtained without pT cut and R = 0.7 (black squares) smoothly increases\nwhen the input jet energy increases and reaches 10% for 100 GeV jets. It is enhanced by a factor\nof 3 to 5 after the application of a pT cut of 0.4 GeV/c on neutral particles (dark grey squares).\nThe reduction of R to 0.4 (light grey squares) increases the efficiency (which becomes flat vs\nET,truth ) to \u223c 30% as less input jet energy is reconstructed. The efficiency worsens moreover\nwhen a pT cut on the charged particles is applied (blue squares) as part of the signal is again\ncut. In these cases the reconstructed energy is under-estimated by the algorithm and the out-ofcone fluctuations from the signal dominate. As expected in Fig. 3, no significant discrepancies\nbetween p + p and P b + P b Minbias data samples (stars) are observed whereas the efficiency in\nCentral (circles) is improved because the background subtraction procedure over-estimates the\ncone energy and the background fluctuations dominate. In Minbias, both effects compensate.\nIn order to understand how the fluctuations affect the jet reconstruction, the distributions\nof the reconstructed jet axis minus the input jet axis have been studied in the 6 previous cases.\nBoth the pT and radius cuts on p + p data affects a bit the jet reconstructed axis but the effect is\nsmall. Figure 4 shows the distributions for the Minbias and Central cases compared with the p+p\none. It clearly shows that the reconstructed jet axis in both cases is biased. Using a small radius,\nthe jet algorithm maximizes the energy by shifting the jet (centroid) axis. In the different systems\nstudied, the evolution of the expected jet energy and angular resolutions versus ET,truth and the\nsystem multiplicity are presented in Fig. 5 (left) and (right).

Right: resolutions in \u03b7 and \u03c6 of the jet direction.\n\ntance were considered. The reconstructed energy resolution worsens from 100 GeV to 50 GeV\njets in the 3 systems. Contrary to the jet reconstruction efficiency, the energy resolution degrades\nas expected from p + p to P b + P b Central because of background fluctuations. For 100 GeV\njets, we obtain an energy resolution in p + p of \u2206Ep+p \u223c 32.5%. The Minbias one allows to\nestimate the Central one to \u2206ECent \u223c 35.8% using equation (1) in agreement with the resolution\nof 36.4% obtained in Fig. 5 (left) validating our background subtraction method.

An accurate reconstruction of the jet direction in the three systems is obtained though\nit is slightly deteriorated from p+p to Minbias and Central. Indeed, the dominating background\nfluctuations maximize the jet energy by shifting its reconstructed direction as observed in Fig. 5.\n4\n\nFull jet spectrum and fragmentation function\n\n4.1\n\nA smeared jet spectrum\n\nThe results presented so far do not take into account the jet cross section distribution as 1/p\u03b1T with\n\u03b1 \u223c 5.7 and beyond at LHC. We note that within a 1\u03c3 fluctuation of the energy the jet production\ncross section varies by almost twofold [10]. Therefore, it is essential to take into account the\nproduction spectrum to truly evaluate the meaningful jet energy resolution and reconstruction\nefficiency. In particular, jets in the low energy tail of the resolution function are buried below\nlower energetic jets with much higher production cross section and, hence, the amount of jets in\nthese tails is a measure of the reconstruction inefficiency.\nIn order to extract the jet production spectrum, 12 bins of pT \u2212hard from 40 to 220 GeV\nhave been simulated with PYTHIA 6.2 CDF Tune A in the 2\u21922 processes. The simulated\ndata have then been treated in the full detector chain of GEANT3 before reconstruction using\nthe official ALICE jet finder including calorimetry. The same simulation including a heavy ion\nbackground using the HIJING generator has been produced. The mean reconstructed jet energy\nhas then been corrected, on the average, looking at the ratio of the reconstructed over generated\njets as a function of the reconstructed jet energy. This correction does not take into account the\n330\n\nMPI08\n\n\fsmearing of the spectrum which is amplified from p + p to P b + P b collisions. Indeed, in a heavy\nion UE and due to the steeply falling shape of the input spectrum, even more contributions at low\npT populate the higher energetical part of the reconstruted jet spectrum increasing its smearing.\nThis of course will have to be taken into account in a meaningful comparison of the N + N and\nA + A data. In the present paper, an average correction has been applied on the jet reconstructed\nenergy so that the results presented below on the HBP are still biased by the smearing effect.\n4.2\n\nBackground and quenching effects on the fragmentation function\n\n10\n\n102\n\nqhat=50\n\n10\n1\n\n1/Njets*dN/d\u03be)\n\n1/Njet \u00d7 dN/d\u03be\n\n/1/Njets*dN/d\u03be)uq\n\nALICE\nPreliminary\n- Mid-rapidity\n(p+p&&Pb+Pb\nPb+Pb\nsNN = 5.5 TeV)\nALICE\nPreliminary\n- Mid-rapidity (p+p\n; 5.5; TeV)\nUA1 Cone algorithm\nR = 0.4, pcut = 2 GeV/c\nT\nEMCal acceptance\nCharged + neutral particles\n\n3\n\n10-1\n\nFull GEANT3 simulation\nPb+Pb: HIJING + PYTHIA mixed\np+p: PYTHIA\n\n10-2\n-3\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\ncorr\n\n\u03be = ln(E\n\njet\n\n/phadron)\n\n6\n\nALICE Preliminary\n- Mid-rapidity\n(p+p; 14TeV)\nALICE\nPreliminary\n- Mid-rapidity\n(p+p; 14TeV)\n\n3\n\ncut\n\nUA1 Cone algorithm, R = 0.4, pT = 0 GeV/c\nEMCal acceptance\nCharged + neutral particles\n\n2.5\n\n<Einput jet> ~ 125 GeV\n\n2\n1.5\n\n1\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\ncorr\n\n\u03be = Log(E\n\njet\n\n6\n\n/p)\n\nFig. 6: Left: Hump-backed plateau in p + p (stars) and P b + P b collisions not background subtracted (circles) as a\n\u221a\nfunction of \u03be at sNN = 5.5 TeV. Right: ratio of the HBP obtained in a p+p quenched scenario over a non quenched\n\u221a\none vs \u03be in p + p collisions at sNN = 14 TeV.\n\nRadiation phenomena in QCD and how they are modified in a dense medium should be accurately probed by understanding how the energy is distributed inside jets. Therefore, it strongly\nmotivates the study of the distribution of hadrons inside jets: the HBP. Moreover, it offers a\nparticular window of study on the hadronisation phenomenon badly understood today. It is important to understand the effects of the heavy ion UE on its extraction. The domain of interest\nof such distribution is for the \u03be region dominated by the production of soft particles which come\nfrom the gluon radiation emission in a quenching scenario. For jets of energy 70 \u2212 100 GeV,\nthis region turns out to be for a \u03be above \u223c 3. Figure 6 (left) presents the modified fragmentation\nCorr /p\nfunction 1/Njet \u00d7 dN/d\u03be as a function of \u03be = ln(Ejet\nhadron ) in p + p and P b + P b col\u221a\nlisions at sN N = 5.5 TeV. The full jet spectra have been considered here. In a first step, no\nquenching scenario has been included in these simulations in order to understand how the soft\nbackground of the UE by itself modifies the expected fragmentation function. As seen in Fig. 6,\nthe soft emission drastically twists (more than 2 orders of magnitude) the HBP, increasing the\nnumber of entries in the high \u03be region giving rise to a distortion of the distribution. In order to\ngo a step further in the comparison of p + p and P b + P b HBP, the data have to be background\nsubtracted. Despite a good background subtraction, the data for \u03be > 5 will not be exploitable\nanymore as dominated by too large error bars. This background subtraction procedure and the\nresults associated are not presented here.\nMPI08\n\n331\n\n\fInstead, we have chosen to show the ratio of two HBP obtained in p + p collisions at\ns = 14 TeV with and without quenching scenario to show the sensitivity one should expect\nvs \u03be. For such a distribution we assume a perfect background subtraction procedure. Without\nspecific trigger bias in the data selection and for jets of 125 GeV, one obtains a ratio which\nincreases with \u03be increasing with a value below one for a \u03be \u223c 3 and above one after. Both\namplitudes below and above this \u03be limit, as well as the exact \u03be position of a ratio equals to unity\nshould allow us to quantify the strengh of the quenching scenario.\n\n\u221a\n\n5\n\nConclusion\n\nTechnical aspects for jet reconstruction in p + p and A + A collisions have been discussed. More\nspecifically, the expected performance for jet physics studies in ALICE have been presented.\nThe observation of some modifications of the jet structure in P b + P b collisions at LHC will\nbe possible for \u03be up to \u223c 5 where we expect to see a clear distortion of the HBP due to the soft\nemission generated by gluon radiation over the soft background of the UE.\nReferences\n[1] BRAHMS Collaboration I.

In particular, they play a crucial role for the understanding\nof the background (the so-called underlying event) in the reconstruction of jets. In nucleus-nucleus collisions multiple hard parton interactions and the corresponding production of mini-jets are expected to\ncontribute significantly to the total particle multiplicity. In this article a brief overview of results on particle production at high-pT in\nproton-proton and nucleus-nucleus at RHIC will be given. Moreover,\nthe observed centrality dependence of the charged particle multiplicity in Au+Au collisions will be discussed in light of multiple partonic\ninteractions.\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn a p + p(p\u0304) collision the location of a hard parton-parton scattering in which a parton with\ntransverse momentum pT \ufffd 2 GeV/c is produced is well defined (\u2206r \u223c 1/pT \ufffd 0.1 fm in the\nplane transverse to the beam axis) and much smaller than the radius of proton (r \u2248 0.8 fm). Thus,\nit is expected that multiple hard parton scatterings can contribute incoherently to the total hard\nscattering cross section [1, 2]. When going from p+p to nucleus-nucleus (A+A) collisions and\nneglecting nuclear effects the increase in the number of hard scatterings is given by the nuclear\ngeometry expressed via the nuclear overlap function TAB [3]. For a given range of the impact\nparameter b of the A+A collisions the yield of produced partons with a transverse momentum pT\ncan thus be calculated from the corresponding cross section in p+p collisions according to\n\ufffd 2\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\nd b TAB (b)\n1\ndN \ufffd\ufffd\nd\u03c3 \ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd *\n=\ufffd 2 \ufffd\n(1)\nA+A dp \ufffd\nNN\ndpT \ufffdp+p\nd b 1 \u2212 exp \u2212TAB * \u03c3inel\nNinel\nT A+A\nA+A\nNN the inelastic nucleonwhere Ninel\ndenotes the total number of inelastic A+A collisions and \u03c3inel\nnucleon cross section. This corresponds to a scaling of the yield of produced high-pT partons\n(and hence also of the yield of hadrons at high pT ) with the number of binary nucleon-nucleon\ncollisions (Ncoll ). On the other hand, the yield of particles at low pT \ufffd 1 GeV/c is expected\nto scale with the number Npart of nucleons that suffered at least one inelastic nucleon-nucleon\ncollision. Based on this separation of soft and hard processes the centrality dependence of the\ncharged particle multiplicity in nucleus-nucleus collisions can be predicted.\n\nMPI08\n\n333\n\n\f3\n\n1\n-1\n\n3\n\n-2\n\n3\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10-2\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n-9\n\n(Data-pQCD)/pQC\n\n10\n\nT\n\n9.7% normalization uncertainty\nis not included\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\npQCD \u03bc = pT\nMRST2002 PDF; fDSS FF\nNLL\nNLO\n\n10-1\n10-2\n-3\n\n10\n\n10-4\n-6\n\n10\n\n10-7\n\n4\n\nNLO pQCD\n(by W.Vogelsang)\nCTEQ6M PDF; KKP FF\n\u03bc= p /2, p , 2p\nT\n\np+p at s = 62.4 GeV\n\n1\n\n-5\n\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5\n\np+p at s = 200 GeV\n\nT\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-5\n\nT\n\n-6\n\n-8\n\n-3\n\np (GeV/c)\n\n10\n10\n\n-1\n\n10-4\n\n10-4\n\n10-7\n\n-\n\n(\u03c0 +\u03c0 )/2\n\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n+\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\npT (GeV/c)\n\n(Data-QCD)/QCD\n\n3\n\n10\n\n\u03c00\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\nE d \u03c3 /dp3 (mb GeV-2 c 3 )\n\n102\n\nE*d \u03c3/dp (mb GeV -2 c3)\n\nE*d \u03c3 /dp (mb GeV-2 c3)\n\n102\n\n0\n\na)\nb) NLO 2\n\n4\n\n6\n\u03bc = 0.5pT\n\n8\n\n2\n0\n\n\u03bc = 2pT\n\nc) NLL\n\n4\n2\n0\n0\n\nFig. 1: Invariant cross sections for the reaction p + p \u2192 \u03c0 0 + X at\n\n2\n\n\u221a\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\npT (GeV/c)\n\ns = 200 GeV (left panel) and\n\n\u221a\n\ns =\n\n62.4 GeV (right panel) as measured by the PHENIX experiment at RHIC [10, 11].

Further methods are the statistical\nanalysis of 2-particle angular correlations and full jet reconstruction on an event-by-event basis\n[4, 5]. The latter method is challenging in heavy-ion collisions since, e.g., in a central Au+Au\ncollision with a transverse energy of dET /d\u03b7 \u2248 500 GeV\nenergy\n\ufffd at midrapidity the background\nbackground\n2\n2\nfrom the underlying event in a cone with a radius R = (\u2206\u03c6) + (\u2206\u03b7) = 0.7 is ET\n\u2248\n120 GeV.

In the sample of the 10% most central Au+Au\ncollisions the yields are suppressed by a factor of 4 \u2212 5 (Fig. 2a). On the other hand, direct\nphotons, measured on a statistical basis by subtracting background photons from hadron decays\nlike \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 or \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 from the pT spectrum of all measured photons, are not suppressed for\npT \ufffd 12 GeV/c. Thus, one can conclude that the hadron suppression is caused by the presence\nof the created hot and dense medium and is not related to properties of cold nuclear matter.\nIn order to search for the onset of the high-pT hadron suppression Cu+Cu collisions at\n\u221a\nthree different energies ( sN N = 22.4, 62.4, and 200 GeV) were studied by the PHENIX ex\u221a\nperiment [12]. In central Cu+Cu collisions at sN N = 200 GeV neutral pions at high pT are\n\u221a\nsuppressed by a factor \u223c 2 (Fig. 2b). A similar suppression is observed at sN N = 62.4 GeV.\n\u221a\nHowever, at sN N = 22.4 GeV an enhancement (RAA > 1) is found which can be explained by\na broadening of the transverse momentum component of the partons in the cold nuclear medium\n(nuclear-kT or Cronin enhancement). The upshot is that in Cu+Cu collisions the suppression\n\u221a\nof high-pT pions sets in between sN N \u2248 20 \u2212 60 GeV. In very central collisions of heavier\nnuclei (Pb ions) the WA98 experiment at the CERN SPS found a suppression of neutral pions\n\u221a\nwith pT > 2 GeV/c already at sNN = 17.3 GeV [13].\nThe most likely explanation for the suppression of hadrons at high pT is energy loss of\npartons from hard scatterings in the medium of high color-charge density produced nucleusnucleus collisions (jet-quenching) [15, 16]. In this picture the absolute value of the nuclear modification factor contains information about properties of the medium such as the initial gluon\ndensity dN g /dy. The parton energy loss calculation shown in Fig. 2b reproduces the suppres\u221a\nsion in central Cu+Cu collisions at sN N = 200 GeV for 255 < dN g /dy < 370, whereas\n\u221a\nthe suppression in Au+Au at sN N = 200 GeV requires a gluon density on the order of\n1250 < dN g /dy < 1670 [17].\nDirect photons are not expected to be suppressed in A+A collisions since they interact only\nelectro-magnetically with the medium and thus have a much longer mean free path length.

This\nsuppression can partly be explained by the different quark content of the proton and the neutron\n(isospin effect) which is not taken into account in the definition of RAA [18]. A further contribution might come from the suppression of direct photons which are not produced in initial parton\nscatterings but in the fragmentation of quark and gluon jets (fragmentation photons) [18].\nThe modification of the parton distribution functions (PDF's) in the nucleus with respect to\nthe proton PDF's are also not taken into account in the nuclear modification factor RAA . Roughly\nspeaking, features of nuclear PDF's as compared to proton PDF's are a reduced parton density\nfor x \ufffd 0.1 (shadowing), an enhancement for 0.1 \ufffd x \ufffd 0.3 (anti-shadowing) followed again by\na suppression for 0.3 \ufffd x \ufffd 0.7 (EMC-effect) [19]. For x \u2192 1 the parton densities are enhanced\ndue to the Fermi motion of the nucleons inside the nucleus. In Fig. 3 different parameterizations\nof the ratio R(x, Q2 ) = fiA (x, Q2 )/fip (x, Q2 ) of the parton distribution for a lead nucleus and\nfor the proton are shown for valence quarks, sea quarks, and gluons [20]. It is obvious from\nthis comparison that the gluon distribution in the lead nucleus is not well constrained by leptonnucleus deep inelastic scattering data at low x (x \ufffd 10\u22122 ). This leads to a large uncertainty of\nthe gluon PDF as determined in a systematic error analysis [21].\nThe gluon distribution is of special interest for the understanding of direct-photon production since quark-gluon Compton scattering q + g \u2192 q + \u03b3 significantly contributes to the\ndirect \u03b3\ntotal direct-photon yield.

In such mini-jet models a\np + p(p\u0304) collision is classified either as a purely soft collision or a collision with one or more\nhard parton interactions depending on a cut-off transverse momentum pT,min (see e.g. [22]). The\ncross section \u03c3soft for a soft interaction is considered as a non-calculable parameter.

Interestingly, the relative increase of the multiplicity per participant from \ufffdNpart \ufffd \u2248 100 to \ufffdNpart \ufffd \u2248 350 is identical for\nthe two energies. This can be described within the experimental uncertainties with a saturation\nmodel [23] (Fig. 4, solid line) and a two-component fit which extrapolates from p+p to A+A as\nMPI08\n\n337\n\n\fin Eq. 4 but leaves the relative fraction of the soft and the hard component in p+p (Eq. 3) as\na free parameter [24] (Fig. 4, dotted line). However, this behavior cannot be reproduced with\nthe two-component mini-jet model implemented in the Monte Carlo event generator Hijing 1.35\n(Fig. 4, dashed line). This does not necessarily mean that the two-component picture is not valid\nin nucleus-nucleus collisions as pointed out in [22]. With the two-component mini-jet model\nof ref. [22] the experimentally observed centrality dependence can be reproduced if a strong\nshadowing of the gluon distribution in the gold nucleus is assumed. However, the used gluon\ndistribution deviates from the parameterizations in Fig. 3 and it is stated in [22] that with a gluon\ndistribution that exhibits a strong anti-shadowing as the distributions in Fig. 3 the data cannot be\nreproduced. Thus, the question whether the two-component mini-jet picture is a useful concept\nin nucleus-nucleus collisions hinges on the knowledge about the gluon PDF and can only be\nanswered if the uncertainties of the gluon distribution in nuclei can be significantly reduced.\n4\n\nSummary\n\nThe interest in hard scattering of partons in nucleus-nucleus collisions is twofold: First, QCD\npredictions for the energy loss of highly-energetic partons in a medium of high color-charge\ndensity can be tested experimentally. Second, the observed hadron suppression in conjunction\nwith parton energy loss models renders the possibility to characterize the medium created in ultrarelativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions. The assumption that indeed the created medium causes\nthe suppression was confirmed by the observation that direct photons at high pT which result\nfrom hard parton-parton scatterings are not suppressed (at least for pT \ufffd 12 GeV/c in Au+Au\n\u221a\ncollisions at sN N = 200 GeV). It remains to be understood how the apparent suppression of\ndirect photons with pT \ufffd 12 GeV/c fits into this picture. It was argued that it is unlikely that\nthis direct-photon suppression is related to the gluon distribution function in the gold nucleus.\nA natural extension of the successful concept of multiple partonic interactions in p + p(p\u0304)\ncollisions to nucleus-nucleus collisions is the two-component mini-jet model for the centrality\n(Npart ) dependence of the charged particle multiplicity. As shown in [22] such a model can\nindeed describe the experimental data, but only if a relatively strong suppression of the gluon\ndistribution in a gold nucleus is assumed. The gluon distribution in this model appears to be\nonly barely consistent with recent parameterizations such as EPS09LO [21] so that it remains\nto be seen whether the two-component mini-jet model is a useful concept in nucleus-nucleus\ncollisions.\nReferences\n[1] T.
