Both measurements were done using a same pressure cell in order to obtain both data for\none pressure. Contrary to the heat capacity at ambient pressure, an anomaly\nis found in the heat capacity at the characteristic temperature T \u2217 where the\nmagnetization shows an anomalous enhancement under high pressure where\nthe superconductivity appears. This suggests that a thermodynamic phase\ntransition takes place at T \u2217 at least under high pressure slightly below Pc\u2217\nwhere T \u2217 becomes zero. The heat-capacity anomaly associated with the superconducting transition is also investigated, where a clear peak of C/T is\n\n1\n\n\fobserved in a narrow pressure region (\u2206P \u223c 0.1 GPa) around Pc\u2217 contrary to\nthe previous results of the resistivity measurement. Present results suggest\nthe importance of the thermodynamic critical point Pc\u2217 for the appearance of\nthe superconductivity.\n74.25.Bt, 74.70.Tx, 74.62.Fj\n\nTypeset using REVTEX\n2\n\n\fRecently the pressure-induced superconductivity was found in UGe2 . [1,2] This finding\nis quite interesting since the superconductivity appears in the pressure range from 1.0 to 1.6\nGPa where UGe2 is still in the ferromagnetic state. This is the first case where the same 5f\nelectrons are involved with both orderings.\nFrom the theoretical point of view, the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism has been considered over several decades. [3\u20135] Basically these theories assume that\nthe superconductivity is mediated by the low-energy magnetic excitation which is enhanced\nnear the ferromagnetic quantum critical point (QCP) where a second-order phase transition\nis driven to 0 K by the parameter such as the pressure or the stoichiometric composition\nof a sample. The superconductivity is predicted to appear in both ferromagnetic and paramagnetic sides of the QCP. However, contrary to the above theoretical predictions, the\nmechanism of superconductivity in UGe2 seems to have no relation with the ferromagnetic\nfluctuation associated with the ferromagnetic critical point Pc since the transition from the\nferromagnetic state to the paramagnetic state is established as a first order in UGe2 . [6\u20138]\nIn UGe2 , there is another \"phase boundary\" at the characteristic temperature T \u2217 in\nthe ferromagnetic ordered state below TC . At T \u2217 , there is a broad anomaly in the resistivity and the thermal expansion. [9] The magnetization shows an anomalous increase\nbelow T \u2217 . [2,10\u201312] Experimentally the microscopic origin of T \u2217 is not clear at present.\nWith increasing pressure, T \u2217 decreases monotonously and becomes 0 K at a pressure Pc\u2217\n(\u223c 1.20 GPa). The superconducting transition temperature Tsc shows a maximum value\naround Pc\u2217 . [2,13] Thus it was pointed out that the superconductivity was mediated by the\nlow-energy magnetic excitation around the \"critical point\" Pc\u2217 . [1,2] This point of view implicitly assumes the Pc\u2217 as a second-order QCP. However there is no distinct anomaly around\nT \u2217 in the heat capacity at ambient pressure. [2,14] Thus, for the understanding of the coexistence of the superconductivity and the ferromagnetism in UGe2 , it is highly desirable\nto clarify that a real transition occurs at T \u2217 and that Pc\u2217 corresponds to a thermodynamic\ncritical point from the heat-capacity measurement.\nIn this Rapid Communication, we report the result of the heat-capacity measurement\n3\n\n\fon UGe2 under high pressure. Our experimental results suggest that a second-order phase\ntransition takes place at T \u2217 at least in a high-pressure region. The heat-capacity anomaly\nassociated with the superconducting transition is observed in the narrow pressure region\naround Pc\u2217.\nA single crystal was grown by the Czochralski pulling method in a tetra-arc furnace as\ndescribed in Ref. 13. The residual resistivity ratio was 600 at ambient pressure, indicating\nhigh quality. The Cu-Be piston-cylinder cell was designed as can be used in the heat-capacity\nand magnetization measurements so that both data were obtained for the same pressure.\nThe heat capacity C(T ) was measured by the adiabatic heat pulse method using a 3 He-4 He\ndilution refrigerator, while the magnetization measurement was done by using a commercial\nsuperconducting quantum interference device magnetometer.\nFigure 1 (a) shows the temperature dependence of C/T at 1.15 (< Pc\u2217 ) and 1.28 GPa (>\nPc\u2217 ) under zero magnetic field. The temperature dependence of the magnetization under the\nmagnetic field of 0.5 T is also plotted. At 1.15 GPa, the magnetization shows a characteristic\nincrease below T \u2217 \u223c 6 K. Correspondingly a heat-capacity anomaly is found to appear\naround T \u2217 , which is contrary to the heat capacity at ambient pressure where a distinct\nanomaly is absent around T \u2217 . This observation suggests that a phase transition takes place\nat T \u2217 at least under high pressure just below Pc\u2217 . The transition temperature is defined\nas T \u2217 = 6.0 K such that the entropy is conserved as drawn by a broken line in Fig. 1\n(a). The value of \u2206C/T \u2217 is about 70 \u00b1 20 mJ/mol K2 , where \u2206C is the jump of the heat\ncapacity at T \u2217 . At 1.28 GPa, above Pc\u2217 , there is no anomaly in both the heat capacity\nand the magnetization. The temperature dependence of the entropy S(T ) obtained by the\nC/T curve at 1.15 GPa (< Pc\u2217 ) deviates from that of 1.28 GPa (> Pc\u2217 ) below T \u2217 due to\nthe phase transition at T \u2217 , while both S(T ) curves show good accordance above T \u2217 . The\nmagnetization at 1.15 GPa increases gradually with decreasing temperature below T \u2217 . The\ncurve of the heat capacity is of the \u03bb-type. These results suggest the second-order phase\ntransition at T \u2217 . Therefore, the enhancement of the linear heat-capacity coefficient \u03b3n seems\nto originate from the low-energy fluctuation around Pc\u2217 which causes the superconductivity.\n4\n\n\fThe value of \u2206C/T \u2217 is roughly consistent with the recent thermal expansion (\u03b1V ) result\n(\u2206C/T \u2217 \u223c 55 mJ/mol K2 ) estimated by the relation dT \u2217 /dP = (\u2206\u03b1V /(\u2206C/T \u2217 ) at 1.02\nGPa, assuming a second-order transition. Here, dT \u2217 /dP is the pressure dependence of T \u2217 .\n\u2206\u03b1V is the jump of \u03b1V at T \u2217 . [15]\nIt is revealed by the magnetization measurement that T \u2217 is induced by the application of\nthe external field along an easy a axis in the pressure region above Pc\u2217 . [2,10,11] In the present\nexperiment, the field-induced anomaly of the heat capacity is observed at 1.28 GPa as shown\nin Fig. 1(b) where the magnetization starts to increase at T \u2217 . Therefore, it is suggested that\nthe inducement of T \u2217 is a thermodynamic phase transition. From these results, the magneticfield dependence of \u03b3n and T \u2217 is obtained as shown in Fig. 2 where the magnetization process\nat 1.8 K is also plotted. The transition temperature T \u2217 is determined by the heat-capacity\nand the magnetization measurements as denoted by dotted line in Fig. 1. Around H \u2217 \u223c 1.8\nT where T \u2217 appears, the metamagnetic-like transition occurs in the magnetization process\nand correspondingly the \u03b3n value decreases drastically. The \u03b3n value tends to saturate at\nhigher magnetic fields. This suggests that the mass of the quasiparticles is strongly enhanced\naround the phase boundary where T \u2217 becomes 0 K. The magnetic-field dependence of \u03b3n is\nqualitatively consistent with the recent results of de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) experiments\nabove Pc\u2217 where the Fourier spectra of the dHvA oscillations taken below and above H \u2217 are\ndifferent from each other and the cyclotron masses of all the branches detected above H \u2217\nare lighter than those below H \u2217 . [16,17] The enhancement of the magnetization below T \u2217 or\nthe increment of T \u2217 by applying magnetic field can be phenomenologically understood from\nthe thermodynamic point of view based on Ehrenfest's theorem which should be satisfied at\nthe second-order phase transition:\n\u2206(\u2202M /\u2202T )H = \u2212(\u2206C /T \u2217 )[dT \u2217 /d (\u03bc0 H )].\n\n(1)\n\nSince dT \u2217 /dH is positive in the measured field, [10] \u2206(\u2202M /\u2202T )H should be negative, which\nis qualitatively consistent with the experimental result. The values of \u2206C/T \u2217 are about 70\n\u00b1 10 and 77 \u00b1 10 mJ/mol K2 at 2.5 and 3.0 T, and then the values of \u2206(\u2202M /\u2202T )H at 2.5\n5\n\n\fand 3.0 T are estimated as -0.056 \u00b1 0.007 and -0.044 \u00b1 0.006 \u03bcB /UK, respectively using\nEq. (1). These values are in good agreement with those of -0.052 \u00b1 0.007 and -0.039 \u00b1\n0.007 \u03bcB /UK at 2.5 and 3.0 T, respectively, shown by the dotted line in Fig. 1(b). This\nagreement suggests the second order phase transition at T \u2217 . Watanabe and Miyake develop\na microscopic theory assuming that T \u2217 is a coupled charge- and spin-density (CDW/SDW)\ntransition temperature. [18] Various anomalous experimental results are explained by the\ntheory. However, there is no experimental evidence for the CDW state at present. Recently,\nPfleiderer and Huxley suggest that Pc\u2217 is a first-order critical point from the pressure dependence of magnetization at 2.0 K. [11] From the present study, it is clear that the enhancement\nof \u03b3 is due to the critical fluctuation related to the phase transition at T \u2217 . Therefore Pc\u2217 is\nconsidered to be the weakly first-order or the second-order critical points. Further experimental investigations are needed in order to understand the microscopic origin of the phase\ntransition at T \u2217 .\nThe temperature dependence of the heat capacity at low temperatures is shown in the\nform of C/T in Fig. 3. At 1.22 GPa, a clear peak associated with the superconducting\ntransition was observed at around 0.6 K, while the anomaly smears at 1.15 and 1.28 GPa.\nAt 1.22 GPa, the transition temperature is estimated as Tsc = 0.60 \u00b1 0.10 K such that the\nentropy is conserved as drawn by a broken line in Fig. 3. The value of \u2206C/(\u03b3n Tsc ) is 0.29\n\u00b1 0.06 where \u2206C is the jump of the heat-capacity at Tsc and \u03b3n is the value of C/T just\nabove Tsc . The residual \u03b3 value obtained by the extrapolation of C/T curve linearly to 0\nK as shown in Fig. 3 is \u03b30 \u223c 72 \u00b1 5 mJ/mol K2 which is about 70% of \u03b3n . By a similar\nestimation for other data on this sample (no. 1), the pressure dependence of \u2206C/(\u03b3n Tsc )\nand \u03b3n is obtained as shown by circles in Fig. 4. The experimental result on another sample\n(no. 2) which was cut from the same ingot for sample no. 1 is also shown by squares. The\npressure dependence of Tsc determined by zero resistance in the resistivity measurement\nusing the sample with similar quality to the present sample is also plotted. The resistivity\nshows the superconductivity in a wide pressure range from 1.0 GPa to Pc (\u223c 1.5 GPa). On\nthe other hand, \u2206C/(\u03b3n Tsc ) shows a maximum around Pc\u2217 , and it is strongly suppressed\n6\n\n\fwhen the pressure deviates from Pc\u2217 . The maximum of Tsc (\u223c 0.72 K) at around Pc\u2217 in the\nresistivity measurement is consistent with the temperature where C/T starts to increase.\nThe heat capacity reflects the bulk nature of a sample, while the resistivity is governed\nby the supercurrent through the paths of pure parts in a sample. Assuming that the zero\nresistivity indicates an ideal superconducting transition temperature Tsc0 expected for a\nsample without an impurity, the reduction rate of Tsc ( = Tsc /Tsc0) due to the impurity is\nabout 0.83 around Pc\u2217. The large \u03b30 value indicates a large residual density of states at the\nFermi energy EF . The phenomenological theories suggest that only the Fermi surface of the\nmajority band opens the superconducting gap and the minority band remains a normal state\nbelow Tsc . [19,20] Recent band calculations pointed out that the contribution to the density\nof states at EF from the minority band is less than 10% of the total density of states. [21,22]\nThus it is not appropriate to ascribe the contribution from the minority band to the origin\nof the large \u03b30 value. The contribution from the considerable self-vortex state due to the\ncoexistence of the ferromagnetism and the superconductivity is also negligibly small because\nthe distance of the inter-vortices (\u223c 1100 \u00c5), estimated from the spontaneous magnetization\n(0.19 T : \u03bcord \u223c 1.0 \u03bcB /U at Pc\u2217 ) assuming that vortices form the Abrikosov triangle lattice, is\nabout ten times larger than the size of a vortex (\u223c the coherence length \u03be, 130 \u00c5). [13,23,24]\nIt is well known that the small amount of impurity easily gives rise to a finite residual density\nof states at EF in the superconductor with an anisotropic gap. [25] In the case of a triplet\nsuperconductor Sr2 RuO4 , [26] the values of \u03b30 and Tsc are known to be very sensitive to a\nsmall amount of impurity, where the relation between the \u03b30 /\u03b3n value and the reduction rate\nof Tsc (= Tsc /Tsc0) were explained by the theory which evaluated the impurity effect on the\np-wave superconductor treating the impurity scattering close to the unitarity limit. [27,28]\nIn the case of the present sample, the mean free path l is about 1400 \u00c5 determined by\nthe dHvA experiment and then l/\u03be \u223c 11. [16] The \u03b30 /\u03b3n value and the reduction rate of\nTsc are estimated as \u03b30 /\u03b3n \u223c 0.7 and Tsc /Tsc0 = 0.83. The application to the theory in\nSr2 RuO4 reveals \u03b30 /\u03b3n = 0.45 \u00b1 0.10 and Tsc /Tsc0 = 0.85 \u00b1 0.05 for l/\u03be = 11. [28,29] The\nvalues of Tsc /Tsc0 for both compounds are in agreement within an experimental error. The\n7\n\n\flarger value of \u03b30 /\u03b3n in the case of UGe2 might indicate that the present superconductivity\nis extremely sensitive to a small amount of impurity. These results suggest the existence of\nan anisotropic gap in superconductivity.\nIn summary, contrary to the absence of the anomaly in the heat capacity at ambient\npressure, the heat-capacity anomaly is found at the characteristic temperature T \u2217 = 6.0 K\nat 1.15 GPa (< Pc\u2217). The thermodynamic consideration suggests that a second-order phase\ntransition takes place at T \u2217 and Pc\u2217 is the weakly first-order or the second-order critical\npoints. We also investigated the superconducting heat-capacity anomaly. The pressure\ndependence of \u2206C/(\u03b3n Tsc ) suggests that the bulk superconducting phase exists in the narrow\npressure region around Pc\u2217 . [30]\nWe thank S. Watanabe, K. Miyake, H.
