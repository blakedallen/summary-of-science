A possibility of a kaon condensation with an abnormal\nnumber of the NG bosons is also discussed.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn this talk I review the approach and results of recent studies1 on collective\nmodes in the color-flavor locked (CFL) phase of dense quark matter at finite temperature. Also, I am going to mention about an interesting possibility of a kaon\ncondensation appearing on top of the CFL phase.2,3,4,5\nLet me start by noticing that there is a growing belief in the literature that\nthe cores of some compact stars might be made of a color superconducting quark\nmatter. Although this was not proved in any reliable way, such a possibility at least\nseems to be likely. Indeed, different theoretical studies suggest that the value of the\nsuperconducting order parameter could be as large as 10 to 100 MeV at densities\njust a few times larger than the density of the ordinary nuclear matter.6,7,8,9 If this\nis really so, the observed properties of compact stars might show up an indication\nof a color superconducting state.10,11\nThe CFL phase of dense quark matter has very interesting properties. Most of\nthem have already been recognized in the original paper.12 Thus, I am not going\nto describe them here. For the purposes of this presentation, it would suffice to\nmention only a few key facts that play a significant role in the analysis.\nFirst of all, it would be appropriate to recall the color-flavor structure of the\norder parameter. In general, it contains an antitriplet-antitriplet (3\u0304, 3\u0304) and a sextetsextet (6, 6) contribution:7\n\n\u2217This\n\u2020 On\n\na b\na b\na b\na b\n\u2206ab\nij = \u22063\u0304,3\u0304 (\u03b4i \u03b4j \u2212 \u03b4j \u03b4i ) + \u22066,6 (\u03b4i \u03b4j + \u03b4j \u03b4i ),\n\n(1)\n\nwork was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy Grant No. DE-FG02-87ER40328.\nleave of absence from Bogolyubov Institute for Theoretical Physics, 03143, Kiev, Ukraine.\n\n\fI. A. Shovkovy\n\nwhere the flavor (i, j = 1, 2, 3) and color (a, b = 1, 2, 3) indices are explicitly displayed. The dominant contribution to the order parameter is \u22063\u0304,3\u0304 , but a nonzero\nalthough small admixture of \u22066,6 always appears.12,13,14\nIn the color superconducting phase, there are two types of quark quasiparticles\nwhich form octet and singlet representations under the vacuum symmetry group\nSU (3)c+L+R . Their one-particle spectra develop different energy gaps around the\nFermi surface. The values of the gaps are \u22061 = 2(\u22063\u0304,3\u0304 + 2\u22066,6 ) and \u22068 = \u2212(\u22063\u0304,3\u0304 \u2212\n\u22066,6 ), respectively. In the case of a pure (3\u0304, 3\u0304) order parameter, these gaps are\nrelated as follows: \u22061 = \u22122\u22068 . Without loosing generality (unless, of course,\n\u22061 = \u00b1\u22068 ), I consider this relation to hold approximately at both zero and nonzero\ntemperatures, i.e., \u22061 \u2248 \u22122\u22068 = \u22122|\u2206T |.\n2. Strategy\nThe aim of this study is to reveal the whole class of collective modes in the CFL\nphase that couple to either vector or axial color currents.1 This ambitious task is\nsolved (at large densities where the color interaction becomes weak) by studying\nthe locations of poles in the corresponding current-current correlation functions,\nZ\nX (. . . )\u03bc\u03bd,AB\n,\n(2)\nd4 xeiqx hT j \u03bc,A (x)j \u03bd,B (0)i \u2261 hj \u03bd,B j \u03bc,A iq \u223c\nq02 \u2212 \u03a0(n) (q)\nn\nZ\nX (. . .)\u03bc\u03bd,AB\n,\n(3)\nd4 xeiqx hT j5\u03bc,A (x)j5\u03bd,B (0)i \u2261 hj5\u03bd,B j5\u03bc,A iq \u223c\n(n)\n2\nn q0 \u2212 \u03a05 (q)\n\nwhere the sum runs over all poles. In order to derive such correlation functions it\nis sufficient to know only their irreducible parts, i.e., the polarization tensors.\nIn the broken phase, the polarization tensor (related to the vector color current) contains two qualitatively different contributions. One of them is the ordinary one-loop quark contribution, while the other comes from the \"would be\nNambu-Goldstone (NG) bosons\". This latter contribution is subtle. It appears in\nall nonunitary gauges as a result of proper handling the gauge invariance of the\nmodel.15 A similar contribution also appears naturally in the effective theory.16 Diagrammatically, the full expression is presented as follows:\n\n=\n\n+\n\nwhere the double line denotes the would be NG bosons. The corresponding analytical expression was derived based on arguments of gauge symmetry in our recent\npaper.1 It reads\n\u0012\n\u0013\n[\u03a04 (q)]2\null)\n(1)\n(2)\n(q)\n+\n\u03a0\n(q)\n+\n\u03a0(f\n(q)\n=\n\u03a0\n(q)O\nO\u03bc\u03bd\n(q),\n(4)\n1\n2\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03a03 (q)\n\n\fCollective modes in color superconducting matter\n\nwhere the component functions \u03a0n (q) are extracted from the expansion of the oneloop contribution of quarks to the polarization tensor,\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n\u03a0\u03bc\u03bd (q) = \u03a01 (q)O\u03bc\u03bd\n(q) + \u03a02 (q)O\u03bc\u03bd\n(q) + \u03a03 (q)O\u03bc\u03bd\n(q) + \u03a04 (q)O\u03bc\u03bd\n(q).\n\n(5)\n\n(n)\n\nThe tensors O\u03bc\u03bd (q) (two of which are not transverse) are defined as follows:\nq~\u03bc ~q\u03bd\n,\n|~q|2\nq\u03bc q\u03bd\n(3)\nO\u03bc\u03bd\n(q) = 2 ,\nq\n\n(1)\nO\u03bc\u03bd\n(q) = g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 u\u03bc u\u03bd +\n\nq~\u03bc ~q\u03bd\nq\u03bc q\u03bd\n\u2212 2 ,\n2\n|~q|\nq\nq\u03bc \u03bb (2)\n(2) \u03bb q\u03bd\n(4)\nO\u03bc\u03bd (q) = O\u03bc\u03bb u\n+ u O\u03bb\u03bd .\n|~q| |~q|\n(2)\nO\u03bc\u03bd\n(q) = u\u03bc u\u03bd \u2212\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\nwith u\u03bc = (1, 0, 0, 0) and ~q\u03bc = q\u03bc \u2212 (u * q)u\u03bc . It is remarkable to notice that the\ncontribution of the would be NG bosons [i.e., \u03a024 /\u03a03 term in Eq. (4)] is defined in\nterms of the nontransverse components of the quark contribution itself.\nThe polarization tensor in Eq. (4) determines the (connected) correlation function\n\"\n#\n\u0002\n\u0003\n2\n2\n2\nq\n\u03a0\n\u03a0\n+\n(\u03a0\n)\nq\n\u03a0\n2\n3\n4\n1\nhj\u03bcA j\u03bdB iq = \u03b4 AB 2\nO(1) (q) + 2\nO(2) (q) .\n(8)\nq + \u03a01 \u03bc\u03bd\n(q + \u03a02 )\u03a03 + (\u03a04 )2 \u03bc\u03bd\nThe locations of poles in this function define the dispersion relations (as well as\nscreening effects) of the magnetic and electric type collective excitations,\n\n\u0002\n\nq 2 + \u03a01 (q) =\n\u0003\nq 2 + \u03a02 (q) \u03a03 (q) + [\u03a04 (q)]2 =\n\n0,\n\n\"magnetic modes\",\n\n0,\n\n\"electric modes\".\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\nIn a similar way, one derives the dispersion relations of the pseudoscalars coupled\nto the axial color currents, \u03a03 (q) = 0. These pseudoscalars are nothing else but the\nNG bosons associated with breaking of the global chiral symmetry.\n3. Plasmons and \"light\" plasmons\nDense quark matter is a non-Abelian plasma. Similarly to an ordinary plasma, the\nnon-Abelian plasma supports collective oscillations of the (color) charge density.\nBy analogy, it is natural to call the corresponding modes plasmons.\nPlasmons exist in the normal as well as in the superconducting phase. The\ngap in their spectrum, usually called plasma frequency (\u03c9p ), is directly related to\nthe quark density in the system. Thus, by considering the limit q0 \u226b |\u2206T | (large\nenergy) and |~\nq | \u2192 0 (long wavelength) in Eqs. (9) and (10), we derive the dispersion\nrelations for both the magnetic and electric modes\nq02 = \u03c9p2 ,\n\ng\u03bc\n\u226b |\u2206T |.\nwith \u03c9p \u2261 \u221a\n2\u03c0\n\n(11)\n\nAs in the case of ordinary metals, the plasmon frequency is essentially unaffected\nby a small (compared to the chemical potential \u03bc) temperature of the system and\nby the presence of the superconducting gap. This should have been expected.\n\n\fI. A. Shovkovy\n\nMuch more interesting are the \"light\" plasmons that were also discovered in the\nCFL phase of dense quark matter.1 These light plasmon modes have no analogues\nin ordinary metals. Their appearance in the CFL phase seems to be directly related\nto the presence of two different types of quark quasiparticles having nonequal gaps\nin their spectra, |\u22061 | 6= |\u22068 |.\nIn the long wavelength limit, the energy of the light plasmon is always smaller\nthan the threshold of producing a pair of quasiparticles, |q0 | < 2|\u22060 |. At zero\ntemperature, in particular, one derives q0 = m\u2206 \u2248 1.362|\u22060 |. The numerical\ncalculation of the temperature dependence of the light plasmon mass (i.e., the gap\nin its spectrum) m\u2206 (T ) is also available.1 Qualitatively, m\u2206 (T ) is a monotonically\ndecreasing function of temperature which approaches zero as T \u2192 Tc . Besides that,\nin the whole range of temperatures 0 < T < Tc , it remains larger than 1.362|\u2206T |\nand smaller than the threshold 2|\u2206T |. It is clear, therefore, that light plasmon\nexcitations are stable with respect to decays into quark quasiparticles. It should\nbe mentioned, however, that other decay channels (for example, involving the NG\nbosons) might eventually lead to a nonzero width. Unfortunately, this question has\nnot been studied yet in detail.\nBefore concluding this section, I should note that an indication of a light plasmon\ncould also be seen in the derivative expansion.17 However, the derivative expansion\napproach (treating the ratios |q0 |/|\u2206T | and |~q|/|\u2206T | as small parameters) overestimates the value of the mass.\n4. Nambu-Goldstone bosons\nThe global chiral symmetry is broken in the CFL phase of dense QCD. This means\nthat an octet of pseudoscalar NG bosons should appear in the spectrum. The\ndispersion relation of the NG bosons reads: \u03a03 (q) = 0. This relation could be\nanalytically studied at small temperatures and in the nearcritical region.\nIn the first case (T \u226a |\u22060 |), the dispersion relation of the NG bosons reads1\n#\n\"\n\u221a\n\u221a 3 |\u22060 |\n5 2\u03c0\n|~\nq|\n(12)\ne\u2212 2 T .\nq0 = \u221a 1 \u2212 i\n4(21 \u2212 8 log 2)\n3\nNote that this relation reveals an exponentially small imaginary part when T \u2192 0.\nIt is worthwhile to mention, however, that the width of the NG bosons might also get\ncorrections due to the interactions of the NG bosons with one another. Since their\ndecay constant is of the same order as the chemical potential \u03bc, such corrections\nare expected to be parametrically suppressed by some power of the ratio T /\u03bc.\u2021\nWhen T \u2192 Tc \u2212 0, the dispersion relation reads\nq0 =\n\u2021A\n\n|\u2206T |\n\u2217\n(\u00b1x\u2217ng \u2212 iyng\n)|~q|,\nT\n\n(13)\n\nsimple estimate shows that the power low corrections to the imaginary part in Eq. (12) are\nnegligible for T >\n\u223c 0.01g|\u22060 |. This leaves a window of temperatures, 0.01g|\u22060 | \u226a T \u226a |\u22060 |, where\nthe dispersion relation (12) is qualitatively correct.\n\n\fCollective modes in color superconducting matter\n\u2217\nwhere x\u2217ng \u2248 0.215 and yng\n\u2248 0.245. This result shows that the NG bosons have\na large width. This is hardly a surprise in the nearcritical region where the gap in\nthe quasiparticle spectrum is vanishingly small. I would like to point out, however,\nthat the numerical analysis reveals well pronounced peaks in the NG boson spectral\ndensity and the peak locations scale with momentum in accordance with a linear\ndispersion law.1\n\n5. Carlson-Goldman collective modes\nThe so-called Carlson-Goldman (CG) gapless modes were experimentally discovered\nby Carlson and Goldman about a three decades ago.18 One of the most intriguing\ninterpretation connects such modes with a revival of the NG bosons in the superconducting phase where the Anderson-Higgs mechanism should commonly take place.\nIn the two fluid description, the CG modes are seen as oscillations of the superfluid and the normal components in opposite directions.19 The local charge density\nremains zero in such oscillations, providing favorable conditions for gapless modes.\nThe CG modes can only appear in the vicinity of the critical temperature (in the\nbroken phase), where a large number of thermally excited quasiparticles leads to\npartial screening of the Coulomb interaction, and the Anderson-Higgs mechanism\nbecomes inefficient. As a result, such modes could exist only in a finite (possibly very\nsmall) vicinity of the critical temperature. Because of the Landau damping induced\nby the quasiparticles, however, the CG modes could easily become overdamped\nin the nearcritical region.20,21 In order to make them observable, one should use\ndirty systems in which scattering of quasiparticles on impurities tends to reduce the\ndamaging effect of Landau damping.\nIn the nearcritical region, the dispersion relation of the CG collective modes in\nthe CFL phase could be determined analytically. It is remarkable that the result\nclosely resembles the dispersion relation of the NG bosons in Eq. (13),\nq0 =\n\n|\u2206T |\n\u2217\n(\u00b1x\u2217cg \u2212 iycg\n)|~q|,\nT\n\n(14)\n\n\u2217\nwhere x\u2217cg \u2248 0.193 and ycg\n\u2248 0.316. As in the case of the NG bosons, the width of\nthe CG modes is quite large. It should be emphasized here that the above result\nwas obtained in the clean (no impurities) limit of dense quark matter. Notice that\nsome impurities might come to game if the phase transition in temparature is a\nweak first order one. In this case, the bubbles of the new phase may play the role of\nimpurities. Of course, this assumes that the transition is sufficiently weak, so that\nthe value of the gap would have a chance to get quite small on the broken side (say,\nless than about 0.05Tc).\nAs in the case of the NG bosons, the numerical analysis of the electric gluon\nspectral density reveals distinguishable (although less pronounced than in the case\nof the NG bosons) maxima whose locations scale with momenta in accordance with\na linear dispersion law.1\n\n\fI. A. Shovkovy\n\n6. Nambu-Goldstone bosons in phase with kaon condensation\nWhile the CFL phase is the ground state of the three flavor dense quark matter in\nthe chiral limit,12 this may not be the case when the quarks have nonzero masses.\nBy making use of an auxiliary gauge symmetry, it was recently suggested2 that the\noriginally derived low-energy action22,23 should be modified. In Minkowski space,\nthe corresponding Lagrangian density should read2\nLef f\n\n=\n\n\u0003\n\u0003 1\u0002\nf\u03c02 \u0002\n(\u22020 \u03b7 \u2032 )2 \u2212 v\u03b72\u2032 (\u2202i \u03b7 \u2032 )2\nTr \u22070 \u03a3\u22070 \u03a3\u2020 \u2212 v\u03c02 \u2202i \u03a3\u2202i \u03a3\u2020 +\n4 \u0014\n2\n\u0012\n\u0015\n\u221a2 i \u2032\u0013\n3 f \u2032 I\u03b7\n\u22121\n\u03b7\n+2c det(M )Tr M \u03a3e\n+ h.c. ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere, by definition, I is a unit matrix in the flavor space, and \u03a3 is a 3 \u00d7 3 unitary\nmatrix field which describes an octet of the NG bosons. In the action, we took\ninto account the \u03b7 \u2032 field which couples to the NG octet when the quark masses are\nnonzero. At the same time, the NG boson, related to breaking the baryon number,\nwas omitted in Eq. (15). Its dynamics is not affected much by the quark masses.\nThe covariant time derivative in Eq. (15) is defined in terms of the quark mass\nmatrix as follows:\n\u22070 \u03a3 = \u22020 \u03a3 + i\n\nM \u2020M\nMM\u2020\n\u03a3 \u2212 i\u03a3\n,\n2pF\n2pF\n\nwith\n\nM = diag(mu , md , ms ).\n\n(16)\n\nAs is clear from this definition, the quark masses produce effective chemical potentials for different flavors. In the case of a realistic hierarchy of the quark masses\nwith ms \u226b mu \u2243 md , these chemical potentials may trigger a rearrangement of the\nCFL phase. In particular, when the value of strange quark mass is large enough so\n2\n1/3\nis satisfied, the CFL vacuum becomes unstable\nthat the condition ms >\n\u223c (\u2206 mu )\nwith respect to a kaon condensation.2 The new ground state is determined by a\n\"rotated\" vacuum expectation value of the \u03a3 field,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03c0A \u03c0B \u03bbA \u03bbB\ni\u03c0A \u03bbA\n\u2212\n+\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\u03a3\u03b1 \u2261 exp i\u03b1\u03bb6 exp i\u03c0A \u03bbA \u2243 exp i\u03b1\u03bb6 1 +\nf\u03c0\n2f\u03c02\n(17)\nThe value of the angle \u03b1 is determined from the condition that the vacuum expectation value in Eq.

This\nsymmetry breaking pattern (with three broken generators of a global symmetry)\nc=\n\n\fCollective modes in color superconducting matter\n\nmight suggest that three NG bosons should appear in the low energy spectrum\nof the system. The direct calculation shows, however, that only two NG bosons\nappear.4,5 In order to understand this seeming paradox better, we consider a toy\nmodel that closely mimics the dynamics of the kaon condensation. The Lagrangian\ndensity of the toy model reads\nL =\n\n(\u22020 + i\u03bc)\u03a6\u2020 (\u22020 \u2212 i\u03bc)\u03a6 \u2212 v 2 \u2202i \u03a6\u2020 \u2202i \u03a6 \u2212 m2 \u03a6\u2020 \u03a6 \u2212 \u03bb(\u03a6\u2020 \u03a6)2 ,\n\n(20)\n\nwhere \u03a6T = \u221a12 (\u03c61 + i\u03c62 , \u03c6\u03031 + i\u03c6\u03032 ) is a complex doublet field, replacing four kaon\ndegrees of freedom, and v is a velocity parameter (v < 1). The parameter \u03bc corresponds to the effective chemical potential of strangeness in the realistic model.\nIt is straightforward to derive the spectrum of excitations in the toy model (20)\nin the normal phase which is realized when \u03bc < m. They are\np\n\u03c9K0 (q) = \u03c9K + (q) = m2 + v 2 q 2 \u2212 \u03bc,\n(21)\np\n(22)\n\u03c9K\u03040 (q) = \u03c9K \u2212 (q) = m2 + v 2 q 2 + \u03bc,\nwhere we explicitly identified the four degrees of freedom of \u03a6 with the kaons.\nWhen the chemical potential becomes larger than the mass parameter, \u03bc > m,\nthe vacuum configuration with h\u03a6i = 0 is no longer a local minimum of the potential\nenergy. This clearly indicates that the system develops an instability with respect\nto forming a condensate. In the true ground state, the field \u03a6 has a nonzero vacuum\nexpectation value which, up to a global transformation, is h\u03a6i = (0, \u03c60 )T and\n\u03c620 =\n\n\u03bc2 \u2212 m 2\n.\n2\u03bb\n\n(23)\n\nThis condensate breaks the initial SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) symmetry group of the toy model\n(20) down to U (1)\u2032 . It is interesting to study the spectrum of excitations in this\nbroken phase. The four degrees of freedom of the complex doublet \u03a6 now have the\nfollowing dispersion relations:\np\n\u03c91,2 = \u03bc2 + v 2 q 2 \u00b1 \u03bc,\n(24)\nand\n\n\u03c9\u03031,2 =\n\nq\np\n3\u03bc2 \u2212 m2 + v 2 q 2 \u00b1 (3\u03bc2 \u2212 m2 )2 + 4\u03bc2 v 2 q 2 .\n\n(25)\n\nOnly one of the relations in Eq. (24) and only one of the relations in Eq. (25)\ncorrespond to gapless excitations. In the far infrared region, the corresponding\nrelations take the following forms:\ns\n\u03bc2 \u2212 m 2\nv2 q2\n\u03c92 \u2243\nvq.\n(26)\n, and \u03c9\u03032 \u2243\n2\u03bc\n3\u03bc2 \u2212 m2\nThus, there are only two gapless NG bosons in the low energy spectrum\nof the\np\n2\nmodel. The other two excitations have gaps m1 = 2\u03bc and m\u03031 = 2(3\u03bc \u2212 m2 ).\n\n\fI. A. Shovkovy\n\nHere one should notice that the existence of only two gapless states should have\nbeen expected based on a simple argument of continuity of the spectrum at the\ncritical point \u03bc = m. By approaching this point from the side of the normal phase,\nwe see from Eqs. (21) and (22) that only two out of the total four states become\ngapless as \u03bc \u2192 m \u2212 0.\nTo avoid a possible confusion, it is instructive to mention that the effective\npotential has three flat directions in the vicinity of the vacuum configuration, as\nit should in the case of the symmetry breaking SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) \u2192 U (1)\u2032 . It is\nthe first order derivative terms in the kinetic part of the action that prevent the\nappearance of the third gapless mode. The same first order derivative terms break\nthe Lorentz invariance (and, maybe even more important, the discrete C, CP and\nCP T symmetries) of the model and the strong version of the Goldstone theorem24\ncannot be applied. In non-relativistic physics, the known examples of systems with\nan abnormal number of the NG bosons are ferromagnets25 and the superfluid 3 He\nin the so-called A-phase.26\nAs is seen from Eq. (26), the two NG bosons have qualitatively different dispersion relations. One of them has a quadratic dispersion relation, while the other\nhas a linear dispersion relation. The existence of the NG boson with a quadratic\nrelation has an immediate implication - it prevents superfluidity in the system.4\nIndeed, according to the Landau criterion,27 the superfluidity is possible only for\nflow velocities v < vc , where vc = mini,q (\u03c9i (q)/q) is the minimum taken over all excitation branches and all values of momentum. The presence of even a single branch\nwith \u03c9 \u223c q 2 implies that vc = 0 and, therefore, that there is no superfluidity.\nThe toy model (20) illustrates a general phenomenon of spontaneous breaking of\na global symmetry (G \u2192 H) in systems with a broken Lorentz symmetry. In particular, the number of NG bosons can be smaller than the number of the generators\nNG/H in the coset space G/H. In the case of dense quark matter with the kaon condensation, in particular, half of the charged candidates to NG bosons have gaps in\ntheir energy spectra as a result of spliting produced by an effective chemical potential. The neutral NG boson candidates do not feel the chemical potential and, thus,\nremain gapless. This observation allows us to propose the following counting rule:\nthe number of the gapless NG bosons equals to NN G = NG/H \u2212 Nch , where Nch is\nthe number of charged particle-antiparticle pairs among the NG boson candidates.\nIn model (20), NG/H = 3 and Nch = 1, so that NN G = 2.\nBecause the isospin symmetry is not exact in the real world (mu 6= md ), the\neffective action (15) has only U (1) \u00d7 U (1)Y symmetry. The kaon condensate breaks\nthis symmetry down to U (1)\u2032 . As a result, only one NG boson (with a linear\ndispersion relation) appears in the low energy spectrum. The corresponding phase of\nmatter is expected to be superfluid since there are no excitations with the quadratic\ndispersion relations. The approximate isospin symmetry could reveal itself only\nthrough the appearance of a light excitation, replacing the NG boson with the\nquadratic relation, see Eq. (26). When the difference between up and down quark\nmasses is very small, this light excitation could considerably reduce the critical value\n\n\fCollective modes in color superconducting matter\n\nof the superfluid velocity.\n7. Conclusion and Outlook\nThe study of a large class of collective modes, reviewed in this talk, gives a rather\ncomplete description of physical degrees of freedom in the CFL phase of dense quark\nmatter at zero and finite temperatures. Some of the modes (light plasmons and the\ngapless CG modes) have very interesting properties and have no analogues in other\nphases. Potentially this may play an important role in producing a key signal of\na color superconducting phase in nature. With this in view, it would be of great\ninterest to see, for example, whether the existence of the gapless scalar CG modes\ncould affect any thermodynamical or transport properties of dense quark matter.\nAnd, in its turn, whether this could have any profound effect on the evolution of\nforming compact stars.\nIn the case of nonzero quark masses, it is possible that the CFL phase is modified\ndue to the appearance of the kaon condensate. The general properties of collective\nexcitations in such an exotic phase were also briefly addressed in this presentation. This new state of dense matter gives an interesting example of a system in\nwhich the number of the NG bosons should not necessarily be equal to the number of the broken generators. Related to this is the possibility of excitations with\n(nearly) quadratic dispersion relations. The latter, if appear, may have interesting\nobservable implications. Indeed, as is known from statistical physics, the thermodynamical quantities such as specific heat are quite sensitive to the details of the\nlow energy spectrum.\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank the organizers of the conference for giving me an opportunity to present these results.
