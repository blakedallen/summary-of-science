One of the main objectives is a better matching of the properties of the radioactive ion beams to\nthe specific requirements of the experiments. Here ion trap techniques have\nstarted to play an increasingly important role, in particular for the accumulation, cooling, and bunching of these beams. Both, Penning traps [1] and\nradiofrequency multipole ion traps or guides [2] can fulfill this task. In addition, Penning traps offer high-resolution mass separation and can be used\nfor beam purification [3]. Radiofrequency multipole ion guides have been employed in ion chemistry and molecular physics for many years [4,5]. Now they\nhave gained increasing importance in the field of nuclear physics, where they\nare used for guiding charged nuclear reaction products from high-pressure gas\ncells into high-vacuum regions in order to form low-energy radioactive ion\nbeams [6\u20139] or for enabling ultra-sensitive laser experiments on radioactive\nions [10].\nA rather new application is the use of radiofrequency multipole systems for\nthe manipulation and improvement of radioactive ion beams as they are available from on-line mass separators. At the ISOLDE facility [11] at CERN, a\nbeam accumulator, cooler, buncher, and emittance improver based on a linear radiofrequency quadrupole (RFQ) ion trap has been realized and used for\non-line physics experiments. The system is installed at the Penning trap mass\nspectrometer ISOLTRAP [12]. Its task is the conversion of the continuous 60keV ISOLDE ion beam into low-energy, low-emittance ion bunches that can\nbe transferred with high efficiency into the mass spectrometer.\n\n2\n\nThe ISOLTRAP facility\n\nFigure 1 shows an overview of the layout of the ISOLTRAP Penning trap mass\nspectrometer together with the radiofrequency quadrupole ion beam buncher.\nThe ISOLTRAP spectrometer itself consists of two Penning traps and has been\ndescribed in detail in earlier publications [12,3]. Here only a short description\nof the tasks of the Penning traps and of the basic operation will be given.\nLow-energy ion pulses delivered by the RFQ ion beam buncher are captured\nin the first Penning trap. The main task of this trap is the purification of\nthe ion bunch from contaminating ions. A mass selective buffer gas cooling\ntechnique [13,14] is employed, which is based on the simultaneous application\nof a buffer gas and an RF excitation of the motion of the stored ions.

Experimental setup of the ISOLTRAP Penning trap mass spectrometer and\nthe linear RFQ ion beam buncher.\n\npower of up to R \u2248 105 for ions with mass number A \u2248 100 [3].\nThe second trap is a high-precision trap [12,15] used for the mass measurement\nof the ions delivered by the first Penning trap. The mass measurement is\ncarried out via a determination of the cyclotron frequency \u03c9c = mq B of an ion\nwith mass m and charge q in a magnetic field of known strength B. Using this\ntechnique, to date more than 150 isotopes have been investigated with a mass\naccuracy of \u03b4m/m \u2248 1 * 10\u22127 (see for example [16,17]).\nFor the ISOLTRAP experiment (and any other ion trap experiment connected\nto an on-line mass separator), the most critical issue is the efficient transfer\nof the radioactive ion beam, which is typically of a few tens of keV in energy,\ninto the ion trap. In an earlier version of ISOLTRAP, a stopping\u2013reionization\nscheme was used in order to obtain a low-energy beam of radioactive ions. This\napproach limited the applicability of the Penning trap mass spectrometry to\nthose elements that can be efficiently surface-ionized. Already several years\nago, a development of an ion beam accumulator based on a Paul trap system was started. Such a system [2,18] was indeed realized and has been used\nsuccessfully at the ISOLTRAP experiment [18]. However, it was found that\nthe acceptance of the Paul trap system was not well matched to the ISOLDE\nbeam emittance and that the ejection of the ions out of the system was very\ncritical.

Basic scheme of a radiofrequency ion beam cooler and buncher. The upper\nfigure shows a schematic side view of such a system together with the potential\nalong the symmetry axis. The lower figure shows the four rods and their supply\nwith radiofrequency and DC voltages.\n\nsame concept as the earlier Paul trap system, but avoids these difficulties.\n\n3\n\nPrinciple of the ISOLTRAP ion beam cooler and buncher\n\nThe principle of the ISOLTRAP ion beam cooler and buncher is illustrated in\nFig. 2. The 60-keV ISOLDE ion beam is electrostatically retarded to an energy\nof a few eV and injected into a linear radiofrequency quadrupole ion trap,\nwhich is filled with a buffer gas. The trap system consists of four segmented\nrods to which radiofrequency voltages are applied so as to obtain a transversely\nfocusing force. The segmentation of the rods allows the creation of a DC\nelectric field along the axis of the system. Ions entering the linear trap will\nlose transverse and longitudinal energy due to collisions with the buffer gas.\nThey are finally accumulated in the potential well at the end of the system\nforming an ion bunch. By switching the potential of the last rod segments, as\nindicated in the figure, the ion bunch can be extracted. For a discussion of the\nprinciple of similar devices used as an ion guide see [19,20].\n\n4\n\n\f3.1 Linear radiofrequency quadrupole ion traps\nThe confinement of an ion in a linear RFQ trap as presented here is achieved\nby combining a static trapping potential VDC along the axis of the system with\na radial confinement. The latter results from the interaction of the trapped ion\nwith a radiofrequency quadrupole field generated by the RF voltages applied\nto the quadrupole rods of the system.\nThe radial confinement in an exactly quadrupolar field can be described in\nterms of Mathieu equations [21,22], which also define the stability criteria\nof the motion. It is useful to consider the resulting motion as being that\nof a particle in a pseudopotential well [23] of depth VRF . While the electric\nfield configuration of the linear trap produces motions that cannot be exactly\ndescribed in terms of the Mathieu functions (due to the strong radial and\nazimuthal dependence of the axial field), it is still useful to consider the firstorder solution of the motion as a linear superposition of the DC axial field\npotential and the RF quadrupole pseudopotential.\nThe pseudopotential is generated by radiofrequency voltages with amplitudes\n\u00b1URF and angular frequency \u03c9RF . As shown in Fig. 2, these voltages are applied with 180\u25e6 phase difference to pairwise connected opposite elements of\na quadrupole rod system. The separation between the surfaces of opposite\nelectrodes is 2r0 . The resulting pseudopotential is given by\nVRF (r) =\n\nq * URF 2\nr\n4r02\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\nq=4\n\neURF\n2\nmr02 \u03c9RF\n\n(2)\n\nis the relevant Mathieu parameter and e and m are the charge and mass of\nthe stored ion. The solution of the Mathieu equation shows that the motion\nis stable as long as q < 0.908. In the radiofrequency field, the ion performs\na micro-motion at the frequency \u03c9RF of the field and a macro-motion that\ncan be understood as an oscillation in the pseudopotential VRF . To a good\napproximation for q < 0.6, its oscillation frequency is\nq\n\u03c9m = \u221a \u03c9RF\n8\n\n.\n\n(3)\n\nAs an example, a singly charged ion with mass number A = 39 in a four-rod\nstructure with r0 = 6 mm operated with \u03c9RF = 2\u03c0 * 1 MHz, URF = 80 V will\n5\n\n\fexperience a depth of the radial trapping potential of about 11 V in which it\noscillates with \u03c9m = 196 kHz.\nAs illustrated in Fig. 2, the axial confinement is provided by applying DC\nvoltages to the different segments of the rods in order to create a potential well\nalong the trap axis. The minimum of the potential curve can be approximated\nby a parabola VDC (r = 0, z) = (UDC /z02 )*z 2 defined by the characteristic length\nz0 and voltage UDC . Since \u25b3VDC (r, z) = 0, the corresponding axisymmetric\nquadrupole potential is\nUDC\nr2\nVDC (r, z) = 2 z 2 \u2212\nz0\n2\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(4)\n\nIn the region where the DC potential along the trap axis has its minimum,\nthe radial confinement due to the radiofrequency field is counteracted by the\nrepelling radial part of the DC potential. The overall potential in the trap\nminimum then becomes\n!\n\nUDC\nq URF UDC 2\nV\u0304 (r, z) = 2 z 2 +\n\u2212 2 r\nz0\n4 r02\n2z0\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\nWith the parameters used above and UDC /z02 = 10 V/cm2 , the radial trapping\npotential well is reduced by about 1.8 V compared to the RF-only case. From\nEq. 5 the condition\nURF,min =\n\nr02\n\n* \u03c9RF\n\ns\n\nm UDC\ne 2z02\n\n(6)\n\ncan be derived for the minimum RF voltage required for three-dimensional\nion trapping.\n3.2 Buffer gas cooling\nAfter the ions have entered the linear radiofrequency quadrupole, they interact\nwith the buffer gas. The ions are elastically scattered at the buffer-gas atoms\ntransferring part of their energy to them. Thus, the motion of the ions is\ndamped until they finally come into thermal equilibrium with the buffer gas\nin the minimum of the trapping potential.\nTo study the overall cooling process, it is sufficient to describe the action of\nthe gas as that of a viscous force. However, for an understanding of ion loss\nmechanisms and final ion temperatures, a microscopic modelling of the deceleration and cooling process including the radiofrequency field is required.\n6\n\n\fVarious calculations of both kinds have been carried out for the system presented here. In the following the most basic aspects of buffer gas cooling in\nsuch a system will be discussed.\nFor low ion energies (less than a few eV), the damping of the ion motion is\ndominated by the long-range interaction of the ion with buffer gas atoms,\npolarized by this ion. This interaction results in an average damping force\nF~ = \u2212\u03b4 * m * ~v\n\n,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere m and v are the mass and the velocity of the ion. The damping coefficient\n\u03b4=\n\ne 1 p/pN\nm \u03bc T /TN\n\n(8)\n\nis proportional to the gas pressure p (in fractions of the normal pressure pN )\nand inversely proportional to the temperature T (in fractions of the normal\ntemperature TN ) and the reduced ion mobility \u03bc [24], which for low kinetic\nenergies of the ions is constant for a given ion species and type of buffer gas.\nFor kinetic energies > 1 eV the ion mobility decreases (see discussion in [19]).\nFor the purpose of this paper it is sufficient to take the constant low-energy\nvalues as an upper limit for the ion mobility.\nFigure 3 illustrates the cooling and accumulation process in a linear trap with\nan axial potential as shown in Fig. 2. The simulation has been performed\nfor a 39 K+ ion entering the system with an initial kinetic energy of Ekin =\n10 eV. The axial potential well depth is Vz0 = 50 V and the trap has a total\nlength of L = 1 m with the potential minimum at l0 = 0.8 m. A helium\nbuffer gas pressure of pHe = 10\u22122 mbar has been used. With an ion mobility\n\u03bc(K+ \u2212 He) = 2.15 * 10\u22123 m2 /Vs, the damping constant reaches a value of\n\u03b4 = 11500 s\u22121 . As can be seen in Fig. 3(a) and (b), both the axial and the\nradial oscillation amplitude of the ion are damped very quickly. Even more\nillustrative is Fig. 3(c) which shows the total energy of the ion as a function\nof the axial position. Already during its first oscillation in the system the\nion loses more than 50 % of its initial total energy. The equilibrium with the\nbuffer-gas temperature is reached within about 1 ms.\nThe viscous damping approach presented above is valid at low velocity for\nions with masses much heavier than the mass of the buffer gas atoms. Figure 4 illustrates the limits of this approach. A comparison of the ion motion\nin the first (linear potential) part of the quadrupole system is shown, as calculated under the assumption of viscous damping and in a full Monte-Carlo\ncalculation. In this calculation the trajectories of several thousand ions have\nbeen investigated using realistic interaction potentials for the collision of the\n7\n\n\f1000\na)\n800\n\nz [mm]\n\n600\n400\n200\n0\n6\n\nb)\n\n4\n\nr [mm]\n\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n-6\n0\n\n400\n\n200\n\n600\n\nt [\u03bcs]\n\ntotal Energy [eV]\n\n60\n\nc)\n\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\nz [mm]\n\nFig. 3.

In the case of Cs ions in He, the\nvalidity of the viscous damping description is nicely confirmed, and even for\nCs+ in Ar, good agreement is obtained in the time average. However, in the\ncase of K+ in Kr, the motion becomes unstable very quickly and the ion is\nradially ejected out of the system. The reason is that the micro-motion of\nan ion colliding with a heavier atom can make a phase jump with respect\nto the radiofrequency which leads to an increase of the kinetic energy. This\nprocess is called RF-heating. In the case of light ions and a heavy gas, it is\nthe predominant cause of ion loss from RFQ traps.\nIn order to determine the properties of ion bunches extracted from the trap,\nthe final spatial distribution of the trapped and cooled ions is of interest.

The\ncalculations have been performed for K+ in He, Ar, and Kr at different pressures.\n\na first approach we take the form of the overall potential in the trap center\nfrom Eq. 5 and the parameters as used above and assume that the ions reach\na final temperature T = 300 K equal to that of the buffer gas. Assuming\nBoltzmann distributions, we obtain axial and transverse distributions as shown\nas solid curves in Fig. 5 for Cs+ ions. The points are the result of a microscopic\ncalculation. It can be seen that the oscillating electrical field and the collisions\nwith the gas have only a very small effect on the ion distribution for Cs+ in\nAr but a significant one for Cs+ in Xe. Practically no effect is seen for Cs+ in\nHe, not shown in the figure here.\n\n3.3 Ion injection and extraction\n\n9\n\n\f1200\n\ntransverse\n\naxial\n\n800\ndN/dz\n\n800\ndN/dx\n\nCs +/Ar\n\n1200\n\n400\n\n400\n\n0\n\n0\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\nx [mm]\n2000\n\ntransverse\n\n2\n\n3\n\naxial\n\n800\ndN/dz\n\ndN/dx\n\n1\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\nCs +/Xe\n\n0\n\nz [mm]\n\n1000\n\n600\n400\n\n500\n200\n0\n\n0\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n-3\n\nx [mm]\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nz [mm]\n\nFig. 5.

The solid curves show distributions for an ion cloud\ntemperature of 300 K in the total static (pseudo)-potential. The points are the result\nof a microscopic calculation taking the RF field and ion-atom collisions into account.\n\n3.3.1 Deceleration and injection\nIn order to stop an energetic ion beam in the linear ion trap by gas collisions,\nfirst the beam has to be decelerated to low energies (in the order of 10 eV). This\ncan be accomplished by placing the whole ion trap on a potential slightly below\nthe corresponding ion beam energy. With reduction of energy the divergence\nof the beam increases. Therefore, it depends on the original emittance of the\nion beam how far the energy of the beam can be reduced by electrostatic\nmeans. For example, an ion beam of E0 = 60 keV with an emittance of \u01eb =\n35 \u03c0 mm mrad that is decelerated to E1 = 20 eV and focused to fit through a 5mm-diameter opening has a maximum divergence of \u03b8 \u2248 45o and a maximum\ntransverse energy of about 10 eV. Whether such a beam can be injected into a\nlinear trap without losses depends on the acceptance of the system. The latter\nis determined by the transverse dimensions and the transverse focusing force\ninside the trap.\nFor the ion beam buncher discussed here, a number of injection calculations\nhave been performed in order to determine the acceptance of the system. As\nan example, Fig. 6 shows a comparison of the transverse acceptance of the\nISOLTRAP ion beam buncher and the transverse emittance of the ISOLDE\nion beam, both at beam energies of 30 keV. The diagrams are calculated at a\nposition 140 mm upstream from the 6-mm hole of the retardation electrode.\n10\n\n\f20\na)\n15\n10\n0.6\n\u03b1 [mrad]\n\n5\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\n1.0\n\n0\n-5\n0.2\n\n-10\n-15\n-20\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\nx [mm]\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n4\n\n6\n\n20\nb)\n\n15\n\n\u03b1 [mrad]\n\n10\n\n20%\n\n5\n\n40%\n\n0\n30%\n\n-5\n-10\n\n10%\n\n-15\n-20\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\nx [mm]\n\n2\n\nFig. 6. a): emittance diagram of the ISOLDE ion beam.

The focusing parameters of ISOLDE beam line elements were varied until maximum\noverlap with the buncher acceptance was obtained. For the acceptance diagram, a Monte-Carlo simulation for the ion injection into the buncher was\nperformed (for the RFQ parameters see Table 2). An ion was considered to be\nconfined when it passed the first 200 mm of the quadrupole rod system without\nhitting an electrode. The calculation was repeated for various phases of the\nradiofrequency field. For each x and \u03b1 value an average of the result was taken\nincluding the beam dimensions x and \u03b2. The result is the acceptance diagram\nshown in Fig. 6(b). From this acceptance and the ISOLDE beam emittance a\nvalue of \u01ebcalc \u2248 35 % is obtained for the theoretical capture efficiency.\n\n11\n\n\fHV platform\n\npulsed cavity\nions\n\nU\n\nU\n\nU HV\n\ntransfer\n\nEkin = e \u22c5 (U HV \u2212 U cavity )\n\nU\n\nU cavity\n\n0V\nt\n\ntswitch\n\nt\n\nt\n\nFig. 7. Principle of creating variable energy ion pulses by employing a pulsed cavity\n\n3.3.2 Extraction and acceleration\nWhen the ions have been accumulated in the trap potential minimum, they can\nbe extracted by switching the potential as indicated in Fig. 2. With appropriate\nvoltages applied to the electrodes, ion pulses not longer than a few micro\nseconds can be generated. The beam properties of the extracted ion pulses\ndepend on the temperature and spatial distribution of the ion cloud. The time\nstructure depends in addition on the shape of the potential used to extract\nthe ions. If no further measures are taken, the ion pulse leaving the trap at the\npotential of the HV platform will be accelerated towards ground potential and\nonce again reach the energy of the injected ion beam. For the transfer into the\nISOLTRAP Penning traps, low-energy (\u2248 2.5 keV ) ion pulses are required.\nAn elegant way to modify the potential energy of an ion pulse is to have the\nions enter a pulsed cavity. The principle is illustrated in Fig. 7. After having\nleft the linear ion trap at a potential UHV the ion pulse is accelerated towards\na cavity at a potential Ucavity to gain a kinetic energy Ekin = e * (UHV \u2212 Ucavity ).\nWhen the ion pulse reaches the field-free region inside the cavity, the latter is\nswitched to ground potential and the ions leave it without any further change\nof their kinetic energy.\n\n4\n\nThe experimental setup\n\nFigure 8 shows the setup of the ISOLTRAP ion beam cooler and buncher. On\none side the system is connected to the ISOLDE beam line system and on the\nother side to the ion beam transport system of ISOLTRAP. A 60-keV test ion\nsource and a beam switchyard (not shown in the figure) are installed upstream\nin the ISOLDE beam line in order to allow test measurements without the\nISOLDE ion beam. Beam intensities and profiles can be measured with a\nneedle beam scanner and a Faraday cup in front of the ion beam buncher.\nMost of the relevant parts of the cooler and buncher, including the electronics\n12\n\n\f1m\n\n6\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\nISOLDE\nbeam\n\nb\n\na\n\nion\nbunches\n\ne\n\nd\n\nc\n\n1\n\nf\n\n6\n2\n\n5\n\n3\n\n4\n\nFig. 8.

Ion optical elements for the deceleration of the 60 keV ion beam and first\npart of the linear ion trap.\n\ninsulators.\nThe ion-optical elements of the cooler and buncher can be grouped into three\nfunctional sections. In the first section the deceleration of the ISOLDE ion\nbeam takes place, the second section is the linear ion trap, and in the third section the extracted ion bunches are accelerated to the desired transport energy.\nAll electrodes are made of stainless steel. Alumina or glass ceramic (Macor)\nare used for insulating parts. The electrical connections to the ion-optical elements are made via UHV multi-pin feedthroughs and Kapton-insulated wires.\nTable 1 summarizes some important mechanical parameters of the system\nwhich will be discussed below in more detail.\n\n4.1 The deceleration and injection section\nFigure 9 shows the design of the deceleration electrode system and its connection to the linear ion trap system discussed below. This deceleration electrode\nsystem is the copy of a prototype described in more detail in [20]. The ISOLDE\nion beam enters through the ground electrode which is equipped with an insulated diaphragm for current measurements. The shape of the deceleration\nelectrode is designed to focus the beam through the 6-mm opening at its end.\nAn additional electrode and the first segments of the four-rod structure are\nused to obtain the final retardation and to focus the beam towards the axis\nof the system.\nFor the presented cooler and buncher ion optical simulations were performed\nso as to determine the optimal position of the ground electrode with respect\nto the deceleration electrode and to get a set of voltages that give the best\ninjection efficiency into the trap system. These voltages were used as start\nvalues for the experimental optimization. A set of typical voltages for the\ndeceleration section are listed in Table 2 below together with parameters for\nthe other sections.\n\n14\n\n\f4.2 The linear ion trap\nFigure 10 shows a photograph of the assembled electrode system of the linear\nion trap with the deceleration electrode mounted.

They are aligned\nby four inner support rods with ceramic insulators in-between, separating the\nelectrodes by 0.5 mm axially. The quadrupole rods themselves are mounted\nvia ceramic supports to four mounting disks as shown in the lower part of the\nfig. 11. The inner distance between opposite quadrupole rods is 2r0 = 12 mm.\nThe holding disks are kept at fixed distances by the four outer support rods.\nAdditional ceramic rods are provided to \"seal\" the system. This is to maximize\nthe gas pressure inside the trap while minimizing the pumping requirements\nof the whole system. Electrode segments of various lengths are used (see Table\n1). The shorter segments at the entrance of the trap allow to set up an axial\npotential gradient for retardation and focusing of the incoming ions as discussed above. In the part of the trap where the potential decreases slowly and\nlinearly, longer segments are sufficient. A high segmentation is again required\nin the region where the ions are finally accumulated and ejected.\n\n4.3 The extraction section and the pulsed cavity\n\nFigure 12 shows the extraction optics of the buncher and the pulsed cavity.\nThe extraction hole has a diameter of 6 mm. The extraction optics consists\nof an einzel lens formed by a cylindrical electrode between two diaphragms\nand a set of x-y steerers. The purpose of this arrangement is to adapt the\ndivergence of the extracted ion bunch to the ion optics downstream and to\nallow adjustments of the ion-flight direction.\nAt a distance of 90 mm downstream from the extraction optics, the ions enter\nthe pulsed cavity, which is only partly shown in the figure. The cavity is\ndesigned to shield the ion pulse from external fields and has a total length of\n380 mm. This is larger than the expected length of a pulse of ions with mass\nnumber A > 20 that is injected into the cavity with an kinetic energy of 2\nto 3 keV. In Fig. 8 it can be seen that the pulsed cavity is fixed to a support\ndirectly mounted on an insulated flange perpendicular to the beam axis.\n\n16\n\n\fturbo pump (870 l(He)/s)\n\nturbo pump (870 l(He)/s)\ngas inlet\n(2\u202210-2 mbar l/s)\n\npHe=4\u202210-5mbar\n\npHe=7\u202210-3mbar\n\npHe=6\u202210-5mbar\n\nFig. 13. Schematic of the vacuum system of the ISOLTRAP ion beam cooler and\nbuncher. Gas flow value (valve controller reading), pumping speeds (for He), and\nmeasured pressures values (He-corrected) are shown.\n\n4.4 Vacuum system and gas supply\n\nFigure 13 gives a schematic overview of the vacuum and gas inlet system.\nThe vacuum system that houses the ion-optical parts discussed above consists\nof several vacuum chambers mostly of CF 150 size. Two magnetic-bearing\nturbo-molecular pumps (Pfeiffer TMU 1000MC) with a pumping speed of\n870 l/s for helium are connected on both sides of the system. These pumps are\nbacked by one 40 m3 /h roughing pump. Differential pumping is accomplished\nby diaphragms at the entrance and exit side in order to reduce the gas flow\nout of the trapping region. The trap is mainly pumped via the entrance and\nexit holes for the ions. The buffer-gas inlet is via a needle valve connected to a\npressure controller (Balzers EVR 116 + RVC 200). Inside the vacuum chamber,\na thin stainless steel tube guides the gas into the central region of the RFQ\nstructure. A full-range pressure gauge (Balzers PKR 250) is connected to the\nvacuum chamber on the HV platform. Its reading is used as the input for the\npressure controller. The pressure value measured with the gauge is of course\nlower than the pressure inside the structure. From gas flow simulations, it is\nexpected that the gauge gives a reading which is about a factor of 10 lower\nthan the actual pressure inside the center of the structure 2 .\nA reasonable working pressure inside the RF-structure is pHe \u2248 10\u22122 mbar.\nWith the resulting gas load, care has to be taken about possible discharge\nprocesses in the system. A critical point is the region where the ground injection electrode is close to the deceleration electrode (Fig. 9) with a gap of 5\nmm and a potential difference of up to 60 kV. One has to make sure that at\nthis gap a pressure regime is reached, where the discharge probability is minimized. The Paschen curve [27] for helium gives a maximum pressure of the\norder of 10\u22125 mbar. Gas flow calculations have confirmed that such values can\nbe reached with the applied pumping speed, the entrance and exit openings\nof the linear trap, the desired inside pressure, and the required gas flow. The\nexperimentally measured pressures are given in Fig. 13.\n2\n\nIn this paper, the values given for the measured pressure are the vacuum gauge\nreadings corrected for the gas-specific factor.\n\n17\n\n\fground cage\nHV cage\n\nvacuum\nsafety\n\n60kV\nfast\nHV\nswitch\n\nbuncher\ncontrol\n\n230V~\n\nisolation\ntransformer\n\n60kV\nHV-supply\nHV safety break:\ndoor interlocks,\nemergency switch\n\nline\npower\n\nFig. 14.

Also shown are\nthe safety interlocks that cut the high voltage in the event of too high pressure and\nallow safe access to the cage.\n\nAnother point of concern are gas impurities in the system which can give rise\nto charge exchange and loss of ions. Such effects have been seen in the startup of the system when ions like argon were injected into the ion beam cooler\nand buncher. Meanwhile, this has been cured by baking the whole system.\nFurthermore, pellets of non-evaporable getter material (SAES St 172 type)\nhave been installed in the gas inlet line of the buncher for gas purification.\n\n4.5 Electronics and control system\n\n4.5.1 The high-voltage system\nFigure 14 shows schematically the high-voltage and the line power supply for\nthe high-voltage platform. An oil-free 2-kW isolation transformer is used to\nprovide line power to the platform. The platform potential is provided by a\nremote-controllable power supply (FUG HCN 140M-65000) with a maximum\nvoltage of 65 kV and a short- and long-term voltage stability of 10\u22125. This\npower supply is connected to the secondary windings of the transformer via\na 5.6-k\u03a9 current-limiting resistor. Varistors across the secondary winding of\nthe isolation transformer protect the electronic equipment on the high-voltage\nplatform from high-voltage transients caused by occasional sparkovers.\nFigure 15 shows the circuit used for the switching of the potential of the cavity.\nA fast high-voltage transistor switch (Behlke HTS 650) discharges the cavity\nwith a fall-time tf = 220 ns. After a constant on-time of 60 \u03bcs the switch\nopens again, allowing the cavity to be charged again to high voltage with a\nrise-time tr = 22 ms.

The DC potentials are applied in two different modes, depending on\nwhether the element is used for a static potential or whether the potential is\ndynamically switched within less than one microsecond.\nTwo different types of circuits are used.

These\nRF voltages are added via capacitors C = 10 nF to the DC voltages UDC,i\n(i = 1 . . . k) in order to obtain a combined RF/DC signal which applied to the\ndifferent pairs of electrodes Si \u00b1 (i = 1 . . . k). Two inductances Lb = 3.9 mH\nprotect each DC feeding point from the two RF signals. The DC voltages are\nprovided by 0 to 500-V power supply modules (Brandenburg). The voltage\nseries required for the generation of the linear potential slope (see Fig. 2) is\n20\n\n\fobtained via a resistive voltage divider chain fed by two of the DC power\nsupply modules. The most critical electrodes closest to the injection side of\nthe buncher and those in the trapping region have separate voltage supplies.\nThe inductance of the transformer and the capacitances have been matched\nto the capacitance of the electrodes in order to obtain a maximum RF voltage\nat a frequency of \u03bd \u22481 MHz. An amplitude URF \u2248 125 V is reached with about\n40 W RF power.\nFor the extraction of the ions from the buncher it is necessary to switch the\npotential of the last segments of the linear trap very quickly. Therefore, the\nrelevant segments are supplied with a circuit as shown in Fig. 16(b). The DC\nvoltage from the DC modules is sent to the center tap of the transformer via\na fast transistor switch. With this system, a fall-time of 0.5 \u03bcs is obtained.\nA number of additional power supplies is used for the voltages of the deceleration and focusing electrode (see Fig. 9) and the extraction optics (see Fig. 12).\nThe high voltage Ucavity for the pulsed cavity (see Fig. 15) is also provided\nfrom the HV platform.\n4.5.3 The control system\nFigure 17 shows the layout of those parts of the control system relevant for\nthe operation of the cooler and buncher. Since most of the electronics is installed on the HV platform, remote control of the system is mandatory. Three\ndifferent optical links provide the communication between the VME-based\ncomputer system of the ISOLTRAP spectrometer and the electronics on the\nHV-platform. A GPIB link (National Instruments GPIB-140) is used to control the function generator for the radiofrequency signal and to read out a\npico-amperemeter. A field bus system (Profibus) equipped with DACs and\nADCs is used for analog programming and monitoring a total of 28 voltage\nsupplies. It also serves for programming the pressure regulation system. A fast\nTTL link (Harting) is used to provide the trigger for the fast voltage switching\nrequired for the ion extraction from the buncher.\n4.5.4 Diagnostics\nSeveral tools are available for the optimization and diagnosis of the performance of the ion beam buncher. The ISOLDE beam scanner and movable\nFaraday-cup in front of the buncher allow the measurement of profile and\ncurrent of beams from both ISOLDE and the test ion source. In order to optimize the injection of the 60-keV ion beam into the buncher, it is important\nto perform a beam current measurement on the high-voltage platform. For\nthis purpose a pico-amperemeter (Keithley 485) is installed on the platform\nwhich can be connected to any of the buncher electrodes.

Layout of the control system of the ISOLTRAP buncher. The electronics\non the HV platform is controlled via three optical links.\n\nanother Faraday cup and a micro-channel plate (MCP) detector are available. This detector consists of 2 MCP's with 18 mm active area mounted in\na Chevron arrangement. No electron repelling grid is used (see discussion in\nsection 6.2). This MCP detector has been used for most of the test measurements reported below. More MCP detectors are available further downstream\nfor the tuning of the ion beam transport to the Penning trap system. In addition, a beam viewing system is available which can be installed behind the 90\u25e6\nvertical deflector (see fig. 1) to obtain the spatial distribution of the ion beam.\nThis system (Colutron BVS-2), which is mounted on a flange with a viewport,\nconsists of an MCP with a phosphor screen behind it. The fluorescent light\nfrom the phosphor screen originated by the secondary electrons of the MCP\nafter ion impact, can be viewed through this window with a CCD camera.\nWhen this detector is used the deflector electrode system is removed from its\nvacuum chamber in order to allow the ions to pass through.\n\n5\n\nOperation\n\nTable 2 gives a typical set of operating parameters for ions with mass number\nclose to A = 39 and A = 133. The ions enter the linear trap with an energy\nof 20 eV after retardation. The value given for the buffer gas pressure value is\nthe (helium-corrected) vacuum gauge reading. As discussed above the pressure\ninside the linear trap is estimated to be a factor of 10 higher. Depending\non the delivered ion beam current, the ions are accumulated for a period\nTaccu = 0.01 . . . 1000 ms. Then the ions are allowed to complete their cooling\ninto the trap potential minimum for an additional period Tcool = 2 ms before\nthey are ejected. The timing of the switching of the cavity is adapted to\nthe mass-dependent time of flight of the ions. For a 2.65-keV extraction and\nan A = 40 ion, tswitch = 12 \u03bcs. The system has been tested with repetition\nrates up to 5 Hz. In general, repetition rates of \u22481 Hz are used for the mass\nmeasurements.\n22\n\n\fTable 2\nTypical operating parameters of the cooler and buncher for ions in the mass ranges\nA \u2248 39 and A \u2248 133.\nParameter\n\nValue\n\nhelium pressure (at gauge position) pHe\n\n6 * 10\u22123\n\nmbar\n\nRF frequency \u03bdRF = \u03c9RF /2\u03c0\n\n970\n\nkHz\n\nRF amplitude URF\n\nfor A \u2248 133\n\n135\n\nV\n\nfor A \u2248 39\n\n97\n\nV\n\ncooling time Tcool\n\nfor A \u2248 133\n\n10\n\nms\n\nfor A \u2248 39\n\n2\n\nms\n\n30\n\nkV\n\ncage voltage UHV\nelectrode voltages Uelec relative to the cage voltage UHV :\ndeceleration electrode\nfocusing electrode\nquadrupole rod segment\n\nV\n\n\u2013230\n\nV\n\n#1\n\n\u201360\n\nV\n\n#2\n\n\u201340\n\nV\n\n#3\n# 4 to # 22\n\n\u201325\n\nV\n\n\u201310 to \u201320\n\nV\n\n# 23 (accumulation)\n\n\u201324\n\nV\n\n# 23 (ejection)\n\n+2\n\nV\n\n# 24, # 25\n\n\u201329\n\nV\n\n# 26 (accumulation)\n# 26 (ejection)\nplates of the extraction system\neinzel lens\npulsed cavity (Uoffset = \u2013500 V, see Fig. 15)\n\n6\n\n\u20131350\n\n0\n\nV\n\n\u201355\n\nV\n\n\u2013420\n\nV\n\n\u201355\n\nV\n\n\u20132650\n\nV\n\nPerformance of the ISOLTRAP ion beam buncher\n\nA number of systematic investigations have been performed with the buncher\nin order to characterize its performance and to compare the results with simulations. For these measurements, both ions from ISOLDE and from the test\nion source have been used.\n\n6.1 Injection, capture, and ejection\n\n6.1.1 Ion energy\nA critical parameter for the injection and capture of the ions into the buncher is\nthe energy of the ions when they enter the system. This energy is determined\n23\n\n\f25\n\ncurrent [pA]\n\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n-5\n29900\n\n30000\n\n30100\n\n29900\n\n30000\nUHV [V]\n\n30100\n\n25\n\ncounts\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\nFig. 18. Current of 132 Xe+ ions guided through the RFQ (top) and number of\naccumulated and ejected ions in bunching mode (bottom) as a function of the voltage\nUHV of the HV platform.\n\nby the potential of the linear trap on the HV platform with respect to the\ninitial ion beam energy. If the potential is too high, then the ions are not able\nto enter the system. If it is too low, then the energy loss in the gas is not\nsufficient to prevent the ions from leaving the system on the exit side or to be\nstopped on the extraction diaphragm.\nIn order to optimize the injection and the platform potential, two kinds of\nmeasurements are performed. In the first case, all electrodes of the extraction\nsystem (see Fig. 12) are connected together for a direct current measurement.\nRadiofrequency and DC potentials are applied to the segmented rods as given\nin Tab. 2 for the ejection mode. No buffer-gas is used.\nIn Fig. 18 (top) the result of such a measurement is shown for a 30-keV 132 Xe+ ion beam as a function of the potential of the HV platform. At the ion beam\nenergy of 30 keV a maximum in the transmission is observed. Increasing the\npotential from 30 000 V to 30 030 V gives a sharp drop in transmission. At a\npotential larger than 30 030 V no ions are transmitted. For potentials lower\nthan 30 kV and correspondingly higher ion beam energy in the system, the\ntransmission decreases gradually. This can be understood since the focusing\nof the ion optics in the injection part was optimized for a beam entering the\ncooler and buncher at about 20 eV kinetic energy.\n24\n\n\fThis transmission mode of operation is particularly useful for a fast tuning of\nthe beam injection into the cooler and buncher. The platform potential is set\nto the value giving maximum transmission and then the current at the end\nof the structure is monitored as a function of focusing and steering voltages\napplied to ion optical elements in the ISOLDE beam line.\nFor fine tuning of the injection (in particular of the platform potential), the\nfull accumulation-ejection cycle has to be employed. The result of such a measurement (performed with a buffer gas pressure of pHe = 1*10\u22122 mbar) is shown\nin the bottom part of Fig. 18. Plotted as a function of the platform voltage are\nthe average number of 132 Xe+ ions per cycle extracted from the buncher and\ndetected by the MCP detector. It should be noted that the optimum value for\nthe platform potential has shifted by about 25 eV, which means that a maximum capture efficiency requires an injection of the ions at an energy slightly\nlower than that for best transmission.\n\n6.1.2 Radiofrequency parameters\nBoth, the amplitude and the frequency of the RF potential should have an\neffect on the ion transmission through the linear trap and on the storage of\nthe ions. Due to technical reasons, the frequency of the RF circuit used in\nthis work was fixed to \u03bdRF \u22481 MHz. Therefore, only measurements on the\neffect of a change of the RF amplitude were performed. The result of such\na measurement is shown in Fig. 19. The upper part shows an injection and\ntransmission measurement similar to those described above. The ion current\nat the end of the structure is plotted as a function of the amplitude URF of\nthe applied radiofrequency. As expected, the transmission steadily increases\nwith increasing amplitude (and deeper radial pseudopotential). Above URF \u2248\n120 V, the transmitted current saturates. The lower figure shows the result of a\nmeasurement where the Xe ions are accumulated, cooled (pHe = 1 * 10\u22122 mbar)\nand ejected. Shown is the number of detected ions as a function of URF . It can\nbe seen that a certain threshold amplitude of URF \u2248 75 V is required in order\nto obtain ions from the trap. The reason is that for too low RF amplitudes,\nthe defocusing radial part of the DC potential at the axial potential minimum\nof the trap is stronger than the generated pseudopotential, as explained in\nsection 3.1. The ions are transmitted to the \"trapping\" region where they are\nfinally lost radially. Using (6) and the actual trap parameters, one obtains a\nthreshold amplitude of URF,min \u2248 60 V which is in good agreement with the\nexperimentally observed value.\n\n25\n\n\fcurrent [pA]\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n100\n\n150\n\ncounts\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\nURF [V]\n\nFig. 19. Transmission of 132 Xe+ through the cooler and buncher (top) and number of accumulated and ejected ions (bottom) as a function of the radiofrequency\namplitude URF . The lines shown serve to guide the eye.\n\n6.1.3 Buffer gas pressure\nThe accumulation of the ions in the linear ion trap requires sufficient energy\ndissipation in the buffer gas (see Fig. 3) and hence a high enough pressure. If\nthe pressure is too low, then most of the ions will hit the exit electrode of the\nlinear ion trap and are lost. Figure 20 shows the number of ions ejected from\nthe trap for constant injection conditions as a function of the gas pressure.\nIt can be seen that a He pressure of a few 10\u22123 mbar is required in order to\nobserve any ions. Above pHe \u2248 10\u22122 mbar the number that can be extracted\nstarts to saturate.\n\n6.2 Efficiency\n\nAfter finding good parameters for the operation of the cooler and buncher\nthe efficiency of the system was determined. From a current measurement\nas shown in Fig. 18 (top) and a comparison with the beam current measured\nwith the Faraday-cup in front of the system, its injection and guiding efficiency\n\u01ebtrans was determined. Such measurements have been carried out with ISOLDE\nbeams from various ion sources. Values for the transmission \u01ebexp\ntrans between 20%\nand 40% were found. This is in good agreement with the theoretical value of\n26\n\n\fcounts/cycle\n\n8\n\n6\n4\n2\n\n10-3\n\n10-2\npHe [mbar] at gauge position\n\n10-1\n\nFig. 20. Number of accumulated and ejected 208 Pb+ ions as a function of the buffer\ngas pressure pHe . The value is the (He-corrected) reading of the gauge at the vacuum\nchamber containing the linear ion trap. The line shown serves to guide the eye.\n\n\u01ebtheo\ntrans \u2248 35 % (see Section 3.3.1).\nMost interesting is the total efficiency \u01ebtotal of the cooler and buncher, which\nis defined as the ratio of the number of ions injected into the system and the\nnumber of ions finally counted in the extracted ion pulse. The measurements\nare performed in the following way: an attenuated ISOLDE beam, but still\nintense enough to perform a reliable current measurement (typically a few\npA), is transported to the apparatus. For the injection into the buncher, a\nvery short opening time for the ISOLDE beam gate is used in order to inject\nonly a well defined small number of ions Nion into the buncher. These ions are\naccumulated, cooled, ejected, and finally detected with the MCP detector. As\nmentioned above, this detector, which is normally only used for simple monitoring purposes, is not equipped with an electron-repelling grid. Therefore,\naccording to [28], only about half of the maximum possible efficiency of \u2248 50\n% is achieved in the case of moderately heavy ions with 2.5 keV energy. With\nthe number of counted events being NMCP and an efficiency \u01ebMCP \u2248 30 %, the\noverall efficiency is given by \u01ebtotal = (NMCP /\u01ebMCP )/Nion .\nTotal efficiency measurements have been performed for various Xe isotopes and\nvalues of \u01ebtotal \u2248 12 . . . 15 % were achieved. This value allows to study ions from\nthe weakest radioactive beams available at ISOLDE with the ISOLTRAP spectrometer. However, compared to the efficiency \u01ebtrans for injection and transmission, the total efficiency \u01ebtotal is lower by a factor of two to three. Storage time\nmeasurements for alkali ions have shown lifetimes of up to several 100 ms. For\nXe ions as used for the efficiency measurement, no significant charge exchange\nwith gas impurities has been observed, which could have caused ion loss. A\npossible explanation is that the MCP efficiency is lower than assumed. It is\nalso likely that an optimal match of ISOLDE beam emittance and buncher\nacceptance has not yet been achieved. This will be investigated in forthcoming\ntest measurements accompanied by further beam injection simulations.\n\n27\n\n\f100\ncounts\n\nHe\n\nCs +\npHe = 5\u202210-3 mbar\n\n50\n\ncounts\n\n0\n100\nK+\npHe = 5\u202210-3 mbar\n\n50\n0\n0\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n100\ncounts\n\nAr\n\n500\n\nCs +\npAr = 8\u202210-4 mbar\n\n50\n\ncounts\n\n0\n100\nK+\npAr = 1.6\u202210-3 mbar\n\n50\n0\n0\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n100\ncounts\n\nKr\n\n500\n\nCs +\npKr = 8\u202210-4 mbar\n\n50\n0\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\nTOF [\u03bcs]\n\nFig. 21. Time structure of pulses of different ions after passage through the RFQ\nsystem for different buffer gases. Here, the ion trap was operated as an ion guide.\n\n6.3 Cooling and beam emittance\n\n6.3.1 Damping of ion motion and cooling\nIn order to illustrate the damping of the axial ion motion in the cooler and\nbuncher for different ions and types of buffer gas, very short ion pulses have\nbeen injected. The DC potential of the cooler was permanently set to the\nextraction mode, which means that the ions were directly accelerated to the\nMCP detector after a single passage through the system.\nThe result of such a measurement for various ion species and gases is shown\nin Fig. 21. With buffer gas of higher mass, the ion pulses arrive considerably\nlater and are broadened. This can be understood by looking at the microscopic\nbeam simulations shown in Fig. 4. There the trajectories show a significant\nscattering also for the axial motion. In the experiment the transmission of\n39 +\nK ions through 84 Kr was also tried, but, as expected no ion was able to\nreach the detector.\n28\n\n\fnorm. counts\n\n1.2\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\nin Ar (pAr = 3 10-3 mbar)\nin He (pHe = 3 10-3 mbar)\n\n0.0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\ntstore [ms]\n\n8\n\n10\n\nFig. 22. Normalized number of 133 Cs+ ions extracted from the trap as a function\nof the storage time inside the trap. The measurements were performed with helium\nand argon as buffer gas.\n\nAn illustration of the transverse cooling process as a function of time is given\nin Fig. 22. In the experiment, 133 Cs+ ions were injected into the linear trap\nfor a short period Taccu = 2\u03bcs. The figure shows the number of ions ejected\nout of the trap as a function of the cooling time Tcool after injection. This\nmeasurement was performed for helium and argon as buffer gases at about\nthe same pressure. For short cooling times, the number of ions that can be\nextracted is small and only above Tcool > 300\u03bcs is the maximum number\nreached. This is because at the pressure of pHe \u2248 3 * 10\u22123 mbar used here\nseveral oscillations are required inside the trap before the radial extent of\nthe ion cloud is smaller than the radius of the extraction hole. The figure\nalso illustrates that stronger damping, and as a consequence faster cooling, is\nprovided by the heavier buffer gas.\nFigure 23 illustrates once more the axial cooling process. In the top figure the\ntemporal width of the ejected ion pulse is shown as a function of the cooling\ntime for the case of 39 K+ ions and pHe = 2.5 * 10\u22123 mbar. As can be seen in\nthe figure, an exponential decrease of the pulse width with time is observed.\nThe pulse width decreases with decreasing ion temperature and smaller axial\ndistribution of the ions in the trap. The width is therefore a good indicator of\nthe ion temperature. The time constant \u03c4cool of the curve can to first order be\nregarded as a measure of the cooling time constant. The value of \u03c4cool = 0.5 ms\nobtained in the measurement shown in Fig. 23 is comparable to a value of 0.3\nms calculated from ion mobility data and an estimate of the pressure inside the\nbuncher close to the trapping region of p \u2248 10\u22122 mbar. Figure 23 also shows\nthat the cooling time of the ions in the trap should be several times \u03c4cool in\norder to extract ion pulses with minimum temperature out of the trap. The\nbottom part of Fig. 23 shows the measured time constants \u03c4cool for Cs and K\nions as a function of the pressure. For the highest pressures, time constants\ndown to a few hundred microseconds are observed.\n\n29\n\n\f39\n\nFWHM [\u03bcs]\n\n2.0\n\nK at pHe=2.5 10-3 mbar\n\n\u03c4 = 0.52 ms\n\n1.0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\ntstore [ms]\n\n5\n\n6\n\n133Cs\n\n6\n\n\u03c4 [ms]\n\n39K\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n10-3\n\n10-2\n\npHe [mbar] at gauge position\n\nFig. 23.

Bottom: time constants\nobtained as shown in the top figure as a function of the helium buffer gas pressure\nfor K and Cs ions.\n\n6.3.2 Cooling limit and emittance\nFor a determination of the final ion temperature both in the axial and radial\ndirection, two kind of measurements have been carried out. In both cases,\nions were accumulated and cooled for Tcool = 20 ms to reach their equilibrium\ntemperature.\nFor the determination of the axial temperature, the number of ions in a pulse\nhas been measured temporally resolved with the MCP detector. The measured\nshape of the ion pulse can be compared to calculated shapes based on ion\ndistributions at different temperatures. Such pulse shapes are shown in the\ntop part of Fig. 24 for 133 Cs ions extracted from the linear trap and accelerated\nto 30 keV. The data are plotted with respect to the time of ejection from the\ntrap. The points correspond to the experimental data, the curves to calculated\nshapes for ion distributions with temperatures of 300 K, 500 K, and 800 K. A\ngood agreement is achieved for a temperature of 300 K giving evidence that\nthe ions reach the temperature of the buffer gas. This is in accordance with the\npredictions of Fig. 5. The bottom part of Fig. 24 shows the calculated energy\ndistribution of the ejected ions.

The theoretical curves are normalized to the same number\nof ions. Bottom: calculated energy spectrum of the ion pulse corresponding to the\n300-K pulse shape shown in the top figure.\n\ndistribution was taken together with the electric fields for the extraction as\nused in the experiment. From the time and energy spread of the ion pulses\nshown in the figure, a value for the longitudinal emittance of the ion pulse\nejected from the buncher can be obtained. The total value is \u01eblong \u2248 10 eV *\u03bcs.\nThe transverse temperature of the ions can be extracted from a beam emittance measurement. Such a measurement has been performed in the following\nway. The beam observation system was mounted at the 90\u25e6 deflector chamber\n(Fig. 1 with the deflector removed). Ion pulses with an energy of 2.5 keV were\ncreated by using the pulsed cavity. With an einzel lens in front of the deflector\nchamber, the beam was focused onto the detector and the beam profile was observed with a CCD camera. The profile was found to be Gaussian-shaped with\n90 % of the beam within a radius of about 1.8 mm. A beam scraper mounted\non a linear feed-through at a distance of 500 mm in front of the beam viewing\nsystem was used to determine the size of the beam at this position. There\na beam radius of 2.5 mm (corresponding to > 90 % beam intensity) was observed. From this a beam divergence of 5 mrad is derived. Combining both\nmeasurements gives a rough upper limit for the transverse beam emittance of\n\u01ebtrans \u2248 10\u03c0 mm mrad.\n31\n\n\fz\n\n\u03a6(z,r=0)\n\nUDC\n\nURF,UDC\n\nURF,+\ny\n\nURF,+\n\nz\n\nUDC\nURF,-\n\nx\n\nUDC\n\nFig. 25. Principle layout of a cylindrical radiofrequency quadrupole ion trap.\nStraight electrodes (line-hatched) are used to create the RF quadrupole field. An\naxial trapping potential is produced via tapered electrodes (cross-hatched) and corresponding ground electrodes (white). \u03a6(z, r = 0) sketches the expected potential\non the axis of the cylinder.\n\nIf the extracted pulse was accelerated to 60 keV instead of 2.5 keV, it would\nhave an emittance of about 2\u03c0 mm mrad, which corresponds to more than\ntenfold improvement with respect to the original ISOLDE beam. This shows\nthat gas-filled radiofrequency ion guides and traps can very effectively be used\nto improve the emittance of ion beams.\n\n7\n\nFuture developments\n\nA new type of radiofrequency quadrupole ion beam cooler and buncher has\nbeen investigated recently. It will be briefly discussed here while a comprehensive study including simulations will be presented in [25].\nFigure 25 shows the principal layout of the system, which is based on a segmented cylinder. Four segments of constant width are used to create the radiofrequency quadrupole field by applying RF voltages URF with appropriate\nphases. An axial trapping potential \u03a6(z) is produced by applying DC-voltages\nUDC to eight tapered electrodes, which are placed between grounded counter\nelectrodes. For the ejection of accumulated ions, the voltage applied to the\nfour short tapered electrodes is switched to a lower value.\nThe advantage of this system is, compared to the present system, that the RF\nand DC voltage supplies are decoupled and no matching circuit like the one\nshown in Fig. 16 is needed. Furthermore, only four electrical feedthroughs are\nrequired for the system shown in Fig. 25. However, higher RF and DC voltages\nhave to be applied, which will require a very careful design of the electrodes.\n32\n\n\fInformation gained from the present setup, from additional ion optical simulations, and from voltage breakdown tests with prototype electrode systems\nwill be used as input for a detailed design of such a new simplified system of\nthe ISOLTRAP ion beam cooler and buncher.\n\n8\n\nConclusions and Outlook\n\nIn the work presented here, we have demonstrated for the first time the accumulation, bunching, cooling and emittance improvement of radioactive ion\nbeams from an on-line mass separator by means of a linear radiofrequency ion\ntrap. The efficiency of the system and the properties of the energy-variable\nion bunches are in agreement with the theoretical expectations.\nCompared to the previously used Paul trap system [18], the efficiency of\nISOLTRAP has been increased by three orders of magnitude. This enables\nISOLTRAP to be applied to very exotic isotopes with low production rates.\nFirst measurements of this kind have already been successfully performed. The\ninvestigation of the masses of neutron-deficient mercury isotopes was extended\nto A = 182 [25]. A mass measurement of the very short-lived (T1/2 = 173 ms)\nisotope 33 Ar became possible [29], delivered by ISOLDE with an intensity of\nonly a few thousand atoms per second. With this increased sensitivity, a very\nfruitful mass measurement program will be possible in the future.\nThe work has again confirmed that the concept of using trapping techniques to\nmanipulate radioactive ion beams is very successful. Based on the experience\nwith the present linear ion trap system we study now the design of a larger\nbeam buncher for the preparation of short low-emittance ion pulses with close\nto 100 % efficiency. With a pulsed cavity as used in this work, the energy of\nthe pulses can easily be varied from nearly zero up to more than 100 keV. The\nvariability of this energy is expected to be very useful for nuclear-decay study\nexperiments, laser spectroscopy experiments on unstable isotopes, as well as\nfor solid-state and surface physics studies using radioactive probes.\nFurthermore, the use of linear radiofrequency quadrupole ion accumulators,\ncoolers and bunchers will play an important role in schemes presently discussed\nfor the stopping of relativistic beams of nuclear reaction products and their\nconversion into low-energy ion beams.\n33\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nThe authors wish to thank J.
