The canonical embedding\nof Weil exponentiable Fr\u00f6licher spaces into the Cahiers topos is shown to\npreserve microlinearity besides finite products and exponentiation.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nDifferential geometry of finite-dimensional smooth manifolds has been generalized by many authors to the infinite-dimensional case by replacing finitedimensional vector spaces by Hilbert spaces, Banach spaces, Fr\u00e9chet spaces or,\nmore generally, convenient vector spaces as the local prototype. We know well\nthat the category of smooth manifolds of any kind, whether finite-dimensional or\ninfinite-dimensional, is not cartesian closed, while Fr\u00f6licher spaces, introduced\nby Fr\u00f6licher and others (cf. [3], [4] and [5]), do form a cartesian closed category.\nWe are strongly biased in favor of our central dogma that the basic objects under study of infinite-dimensional differential geometry should form a cartesian\nclosed category. It seems that Fr\u00f6licher and his followers do not know what a\nkind of Fr\u00f6licher space, besides convenient vector spaces, should become the\nbasic object of research for infinite-dimensional differential geometry. The category of Fr\u00f6licher spaces and smooth mappings should be restricted adequately\nto a cartesian closed subcategory.\nSynthetic differential geometry is differential geometry with a cornucopia\nof nilpotent infinitesimals. For a standard textbook on synthetic differential\ngeometry the reader is referred to [8], whose Chapter III is devoted to its model\n1\n\n\ftheory. Roughly speaking, a space of nilpotent infinitesimals of some kind, which\nexists only within an imaginary world, corresponds to a Weil algebra, which is\nan entity of the real world. The central object of study in synthetic differential\ngeometry is microlinear spaces. Although the notion of a manifold (=a pasting\nof copies of a certain linear space) is defined on the local level, the notion of\nmicrolinearity is defined absolutely on the genuinely infinitesimal level. What\nwe should do so as to get an adequately restricted cartesian closed category\nof Fr\u00f6licher spaces is to emancipate microlinearity from within a well-adapted\nmodel of synthetic differential geometry. In other words, we should externalize\nthe notion of microlinearity for Fr\u00f6licher spaces, which is the princcipal objective\nin this paper.\nAlthough nilpotent infinitesimals exist only within a well-adapted model of\nsynthetic differential geometry, the notion of Weil functor was formulated for\nfinite-dimensional manifolds (cf. Section 35 of [9]) and for infinite-dimensional\nmanifolds (cf. Section 31 of [10]). It was generalized to that for Fr\u00f6licher spaces\nin our previous paper [15], which paved the way to microlinearity for Fr\u00f6licher\nspaces. This is the first step towards microlinearity for Fr\u00f6licher spaces. Therein\nall Fr\u00f6licher spaces which believe in fantasy that all Weil functors are really\nexponentiations by some adequate infinitesimal objects in imagination form a\ncartesian closed category. This is the second step towards microlinearity for\nFr\u00f6licher spaces. We will introduce the notion of \"transversal limit diagram\nof Fr\u00f6licher spaces\" after the manner of that of \"transversal pullback\" in Section 3, which is a familiar token in the arena of synthetic differential geometry.\nThis is the third and final step towards microlinearity for Fr\u00f6licher spaces. Just\nas microlinearity is closed under arbitrary limits within a well-adapted model\nof synthetic differential geometry, microlinearity for Fr\u00f6licher spaces is closed\nunder arbitrary transversal limits. We will introduce the central notion of microlinearity in Section 4, where it is to be shown that Weil exponentiable and\nmicrolinear Fr\u00f6licher spaces, together with smooth mappings among them, form\na cartesian closed category. In Section 5 we will demonstrate that our canonical\nembedding of the category of Fr\u00f6licher spaces and smooth mappings into the\nCahiers topos preserves microlinearity. Therein our hasty discussions in Section\n5 of [15] will also be elaborated.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nPreliminaries\nWeil Prolongation\n\nIn our previous paper [15] we have discussed how to assign, to each pair (X, W )\nof a Fr\u00f6licher space X and a Weil algebra W , another Fr\u00f6licher space X \u2297 W ,\ncalled the Weil prolongation of X with respect to W , which naturally extends\nto a bifunctor FS \u00d7 W \u2192 FS, where FS is the category of Fr\u00f6licher spaces and\nsmooth mappings, and W is the category of Weil algebras. We have shown in\n[15] that\n\n2\n\n\fTheorem 1 The functor * \u2297 W : FS \u2192 FS is product-preserving for any Weil\nalgebra W .\n\n2.2\n\nWeil Exponentiability\n\nA Fr\u00f6licher space X is called Weil exponentiable if\n(X \u2297 (W1 \u2297\u221e W2 ))Y = (X \u2297 W1 )Y \u2297 W2\n\n(1)\n\nholds naturally for any Fr\u00f6licher space Y and any Weil algebras W1 and W2 . If\nY = 1, then (1) degenerates into\nX \u2297 (W1 \u2297\u221e W2 ) = (X \u2297 W1 ) \u2297 W2\n\n(2)\n\nIf W1 = R, then (1) degenerates into\n(X \u2297 W2 )Y = X Y \u2297 W2\n\n(3)\n\nThe following propositions and theorem have been established in our previous paper [15].\nProposition 2 Convenient vector spaces are Weil exponentiable.\nCorollary 3 C \u221e -manifolds in the sense of [10] (cf. Section 27) are Weil exponentiable.\nProposition 4 If X is a Weil exponentiable Fr\u00f6licher space, then so is X \u2297 W\nfor any Weil algebra W .\nProposition 5 If X and Y are Weil exponentiable Fr\u00f6licher spaces, then so is\nX \u00d7Y.\nProposition 6 If X is a Weil exponentiable Fr\u00f6licher space, then so is X Y for\nany Fr\u00f6licher space Y .\nTheorem 7 Weil exponentiable Fr\u00f6licher spaces, together with smooth mappings among them, form a Cartesian closed subcategory FSWE of the category\nFS.\n\n3\n\nTransversal Limit Diagrams\n\nGenerally speaking, limits in the category FS are bamboozling. The notion of\nlimit in FS should be elaborated geometrically.\nA finite cone D in FS is called a transversal limit diagram providing that\nD \u2297 W is a limit diagram in FS for any Weil algebra W , where the diagram\nD \u2297 W is obtained from D by putting \u2297W to the right of every object and every\nmorphism in D. By taking W = R, we see that a transversal limit diagram is\nalways a limit diagram. The limit of a finite diagram of Fr\u00f6licher spaces is said\nto be transversal providing that its limit diagram is a transversal limit diagram.\n3\n\n\fLemma 8 If D is a transversal limit diagram whose objects are all Weil exponentiable, then DX is also a transversal limit diagram for any Fr\u00f6licher space\nX, where DX is obtained from D by putting X as the exponential over every\nobject and every morphism in D.\nProof. Since the functor *X : FS \u2192 FS preserves limits, we have\nDX \u2297 W = (D \u2297 W )X\nfor any Weil algebra W , so that we have the desired result.\nLemma 9 If D is a transversal limit diagram whose objects are all Weil exponentiable, then D \u2297 W is also a transversal limit diagram for any Weil algebra\nW.\nProof. Since the functor W \u2297\u221e * : W \u2192 W preserves finite limits, we have\n(D \u2297 W ) \u2297 W \u2032 = D \u2297 (W \u2297\u221e W \u2032 )\nfor any Weil algebra W \u2032 , so that we have the desired result.\n\n4\n\nMicrolinearity\n\nA Fr\u00f6licher space X is called microlinear providing that any finite limit diagram\nD in W yields a limit diagram X \u2297 D in FS, where X \u2297 D is obtained from D\nby putting X\u2297 to the left of every object and every morphism in D.\nThe following result should be obvious.\nProposition 10 Convenient vector spaces are microlinear.\nCorollary 11 C \u221e -manifolds in the sense of [10] (cf. Section 27) are microlinear.\nProposition 12 If X is a Weil exponentiable and microlinear Fr\u00f6licher space,\nthen so is X \u2297 W for any Weil algebra W .\nProof. This follows simply from Proposition 4 and Lemma 9.\nProposition 13 If X and Y are microlinear Fr\u00f6licher spaces, then so is X \u00d7Y .\nProof. This follows simply from Theorem 1 and the familiar fact that the\nfunctor * \u00d7 * : FS \u00d7 FS \u2192 FS preserves limits.\nProposition 14 If X is a Weil exponentiable and microlinear Fr\u00f6licher space,\nthen so is X Y for any Fr\u00f6licher space Y .\nProof. This follows simply from (3), Proposition 6 and Lemma 8.\nWe recapitulate:\n4\n\n\fTheorem 15 Weil exponentiable and microlinear Fr\u00f6licher spaces, together\nwith smooth mappings among them, form a cartesian closed subcategory FSWE,ML\nof the category FS.\nWe note in passing that microlinearity is closed under transversal limits.\nTheorem 16 If the limit of a diagram F of microlinear Fr\u00f6licher spaces is\ntransversal, then it is microlinear.\nProof. Let X be the limit of the diagram F , i.e.,\nX = Lim F\nLet W be the limit of an arbitrarily given finite diagram D of Weil algebras,\ni.e.,\nW = Lim D\nWe denote by F \u2297 D the diagram obtained from the diagrams F and D by the\napplication of the bifunctor \u2297 : FS \u00d7 W \u2192 FS. By recalling that double limits\nin a complete category commute (cf. Section 2 of Chapter IX of [12]), we have\nLim (X \u2297 D)\n= Lim ((Lim F ) \u2297 D)\n= LimD LimF (F \u2297 D)\n[since Lim F is the transversal limit]\n= LimF LimD (F \u2297 D)\n[since double limits commute]\n= Lim (F \u2297 (Lim D))\n[since every object in F is microlinear]\n= Lim (F \u2297 W )\n= (Lim F ) \u2297 W\n[since Lim F is the transversal limit]\n=X \u2297W\nTherefore we have the desired result.\nProposition 17 If a Weil exponentiable Fr\u00f6licher space X is microlinear, then\nany finite limit diagram D in W yields a transversal limit diagram X \u2297 D in\nFS.\nProof. By the same token as in the proof of Lemma 9.\n\n5\n\n\f5\n\nThe Embedding into the Cahiers Topos\n\nLet D be the full subcategory of the category of C \u221e -algebras in form C \u221e (Rn )\u2297\u221e\nW with a natural number n and a Weil algebra W . Now we would like to extend\n\u2297\n\u2297\nthe Weil prolongation FSWE \u00d7 W\u2192FSWE to a bifunctor FSWE \u00d7 D\u2192FSWE .\nOn objects we define\nn\nX \u2297 C = XR \u2297 W\n(4)\nfor any Weil exponentiable Fr\u00f6licher space X and any C = C \u221e (Rn ) \u2297\u221e W . By\nn\nProposition 6 X R is Weil exponentiable, so that X \u2297 C is Weil exponentiable\nby Proposition 4. It is easy to see that the right hand of (4) is functorial in X,\nbut we have not so far succeeded in establishing its functoriality in C. Therefore\nwe pose it as a conjecture.\nConjecture 18 The right hand of (4) is functorial in C, so that we have a\n\u2297\nbifunctor FSWE \u00d7 D\u2192FSWE .\nIn the following we will assume that the conjecture is really true. We define\nthe functor J : FSWE \u2192 SetsD to be the exponential adjoint to the composite\n\u2297\n\nFSWE \u00d7 D\u2192FSWE \u2192 Sets\nwhere FSWE \u2192 Sets is the underlying-set functor.

In other words, it preserves finite products and exponentials. It is\nfull and faithful. It sends the Weil prolongation to the exponentiation by the\ncorresponding infinitesimal object.\nProof. The first statement follows from Propositions 20 and 21. The second\nstatement that it is full and faithful follows by the same token as in [6] and [7].\nThe final statement follows from Proposition 19.\nNow we are concerned with microlinearity. First we will establish\nProposition 23 The functor J : FSWE \u2192 SetsD preserves transversal limit\ndiagrams. In other words, the functor J always sends a transversal limit diagram\nof Fr\u00f6licher spaces lying in FSWE to the limit diagram in SetsD .\nProof. We should show that a transversal limit diagram D in FSWE always\nyields a limit diagram J(D) in SetsD . To this end, it suffices to show (cf.\n[13], pp. 22-23) that J(D)(C) is a limit diagram in Sets for any object C =\nC \u221e (Rn ) \u2297\u221e W in D. Since the forgetful functor FS \u2192 Sets preserves limits,\nn\nwe have only to note that DR \u2297 W is a limit diagram in FS, which follows\nreadily from Lemma 8.\nTheorem 24 The functor J : FSWE \u2192 SetsD preserves microlinearity.\nProof. This follows simply Propositions 17, 19 and 23.\nThe site of definition for the Cahiers topos C is the dual category Dop of the\ncategory D together with the open-cover topology, so that we have the canonical\nembedding\nC \u0592\u2192SetsD\nBy the same token as in [6] and [7] we can see that the functor J : FSWE \u2192\nSetsD factors in the above embedding. The resulting functor is denoted by JC .\nSince the above embedding creates limits and exponentials, Theorems 22 and\n24 yields directly\nTheorem 25 The functor JC : FSWE \u2192 C preserves the cartesian closed structure. In other words, it preserves finite products and exponentials. It is full and\nfaithful. It sends the Weil prolongation to the exponentiation by the corresponding infinitesimal object. The functor JC preserves transversal limit diagrams\nand microlinearity.\n\nReferences\n[1] Dubuc, E.:Sur les mod\u00e8les de la g\u00e9om\u00e9trie diff\u00e9rentielle synth\u00e9tique,\nCahiers de Topologie et G\u00e9om\u00e9trie Diff\u00e9rentielle, 20 (1979), 231-279.\n[2] Fr\u00f6licher, Alfred and Bucher, W.:Calculus in Vector Spaces without Norm,\nLecture Notes in Mathematics, 30 (1966), Springer-Verlag, Berlin and Heidelberg.\n8\n\n\f[3] Fr\u00f6licher, Alfred:Smooth structures, Lecture Notes in Mathematics, 962\n(1982), 69-81, Springer-Verlag, Berlin and Heidelberg.\n[4] Fr\u00f6licher, Alfred:Cartesian closed categories and analysis of smooth maps,\nLecture Notes in Mathematics, 1174 (1986), 43-51, Springer-Verlag, Berlin\nand Heidelberg.\n[5] Fr\u00f6licher, Alfred and Kriegl, Andreas:Linear Spaces and Differentiation\nTheory, John Wiley and Sons, Chichester, 1988.\n[6] Kock, Anders:Convenient vector spaces embed into the Cahiers topos,\nCahiers de Topologie et G\u00e9om\u00e9trie Diff\u00e9rentielle Cat\u00e9goriques, 27 (1986),\n3-17.\n[7] Kock, Anders and Reyes, Gonzalo E.:Corrigendum and addenda to the\npaper \"Convenient vector spaces embed ...\", Cahiers de Topologie et\nG\u00e9om\u00e9trie Diff\u00e9rentielle Cat\u00e9goriques, 28 (1987), 99-110.\n[8] Kock, Anders:Synthetic Differential Geometry, 2nd edition, Cambridge\nUniversity Press, Cambridge, 2006.\n[9] Kol\u00e1\u0159, Ivan, Michor, Peter W. and Slov\u00e1k, Jan:Natural Operations in Differential Geometry, Springer-Verlag, Berlin and Heidelberg, 1993.\n[10] Kriegl, Andreas and Michor, Peter W.:The Convenient Setting of Global\nAnalysis, American Mathematical Society, Rhode Island, 1997.\n[11] Lavendhomme, Ren\u00e9:Basic Concepts of Synthetic Differential Geometry,\nKluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, 1996.\n[12] MacLane, Saunders:Categories for the Working Mathematician, SpringerVerlag, New York, 1971.\n[13] MacLane, Saunders and Moerdijk, Ieke:Sheaves in Geometry and Logic,\nSpringer-Verlag, New York, 1992.\n[14] Moerdijk, Ieke and Reyes, Gonzalo E.:Models for Smooth Infinitesimal\nAnalysis, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1991.\n[15] Nishimura, Hirokazu: A much larger class of Fr\u00f6licher spaces than that\nof convenient vector spaces may embed into the Cahiers topos, Far East\nJournal of Mathematical Sciences, 35 (2009), 211-223.\n[16] Nishimura, Hirokazu: Differential geometry of microlinear Fr\u00f6licher spaces\nI, in preparation.\n[17] Nishimura, Hirokazu: Differential geometry of microlinear Fr\u00f6licher spaces\nII, in preparation.\n[18] Schubert, Horst:Categories, Springer-Verlag, Berlin and Heidelberg, 1972.\n\n9\n\n\f[19] Weil, Andr\u00e9:Th\u00e9orie des points proches sur les vari\u00e9t\u00e9s diff\u00e9rentiables,\nColloques Internationaux du Centre National de la Reserche Scientifique,\nStrassbourg, pp.111-117, 1953.\n\n10\n\n\f"}
