[1, 2]. The Double-Chooz [3], Daya Bay [4], and RENO\nCollaborations [5] are aiming to measure \u03b813 with very high precision with the use of\n\u03bd\u0304e 's produced in nuclear reactors. The present upper bound to this quantity reported\nby the Chooz [3] and MINOS [6] Collaborations is: \u03b813 < 11.4\u25e6 .\nThe Double-Chooz, Daya Bay and RENO experiments monitor the inverse betadecay reaction on a hydrogen target\n\u03bd\u0304e + p \u2192 e+ + n\n\n(1)\n\nfor a known anti-neutrino energy flux. The positron yield is measured as a function\nof the positron energy. An accurate extraction of the mixing angle \u03b813 from an\nanalysis of the measured positron yield requires a precise knowledge of the radiative\ncorrections (RCs). In earlier papers [7, 8, 9], the relevant RCs were evaluated in the\ntheoretical framework developed by Sirlin and Marciano [10, 11]. In this framework,\nto be referred to as the S-M approach, the RCs of order \u03b1 are decomposed into\nso-called outer and inner corrections. The outer correction is a universal function\nof the lepton energy and is independent of the details of hadron physics, whereas\nthe inner correction is influenced by short-distance physics and the hadron structure.\nThe inner corrections coming from \u03b3 and weak-boson loop diagrams are divided into\nhigh-momentum and low-momentum parts. The former is evaluated in the currentquark picture, while the latter is computed with the use of the phenomenological\nelectroweak-interaction form factors of the nucleon. Although the estimates of inner\ncorrections in the S-M formalism are considered to be reliable to the level of accuracy\nquoted in the literature, the possibility that these estimates may involve some degree\nof model dependence is not totally excluded.\nWe present here a calculation of the RCs to order \u03b1 based on effective field theory (EFT). We use heavy-baryon chiral perturbation theory (HB\u03c7PT), which is an\neffective low-energy theory of QCD, see e.g. Ref [12]. In HB\u03c7PT the short distance\nhadronic and electroweak processes are subsumed into a well-defined set of low-energy\nconstants (LECs). In other words, these LECs systematically parameterize the inner\ncorrections of the S-M approach. Therefore, insofar as there are enough sources of information to determine the values of these LECs, HB\u03c7PT leads to model-independent\nresults with systematic estimates of higher-order corrections. The use of HB\u03c7PT to\ncalculate electroweak transition amplitudes for the nucleon and few-nucleon systems\n1\n\n\fwere pioneered in Refs. [13, 14, 15], and subsequently there have been many important developments. In Ref. [16], we presented the first ever EFT-based calculation\nof RCs for the neutron \u03b2-decay process, n \u2192 p + e\u2212 + \u03bd\u0304e . Because in HB\u03c7PT the\nnucleons are treated as point-like, it is expected on general grounds that the order-\u03b1\nRCs are common between neutron \u03b2-decay and inverse \u03b2-decay. Meanwhile, it should\nbe mentioned that, in the counting scheme adopted here and in Ref.[16], the order-\u03b1\nRCs are of the same order as the m\u22121\nnucleon-recoil corrections including the \"weak\nN\nmagnetism\" contributions,1 and hence a consistent EFT calculation should include\nthese recoil corrections simultaneously. We present here such an EFT calculation,\ntaking advantage of the fact that the m\u22121\n-expansion is a natural part of our counting\nN\nscheme and thus dictates how to incorporate recoil corrections order by order (see\nlater in the text).\nSince exactly the same LECs are involved in the EFT calculations of inverse \u03b2decay and neutron \u03b2-decay, we can in principle use the existing neutron \u03b2-decay\ndata to determine those LECs and make a model-independent estimation of RCs for\nthe inverse \u03b2-decay, provided that the m\u22121\nrecoil corrections are properly taken into\nN\naccount. In this connection, we note that an attempt has been made in the literature [7, 19] to directly relate the neutron decay rate with the inverse \u03b2-decay cross\nsection, assuming that the order-\u03b1 corrections (RCs and recoil corrections combined)\nare common between these processes. As mentioned, this assumption is justified as\nfar as the genuine RCs of order \u03b1 is concerned. However, as described later in the\ntext, our calculation shows differences between the m\u22121\ncorrections for inverse \u03b2N\ndecay, Eq. (1), and those for neutron \u03b2-decay. We therefore caution against writing\nthe cross section for the reaction in Eq. (1) in terms of the neutron mean life, \u03c4n , as\nadvocated in Refs. [7, 19].\nThis paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we explain a theoretical framework\nto be used and present the results for the order-\u03b1 RCs. In section 3 we consider the\nrecoil corrections and compare our results with an earlier work[19]. Section 4 gives a\nsummary of our calculations and conclusions. The appendix describes some technical\ndetails concerning the HB\u03c7PT treatment of the infrared singularity.\n\n2\n\nThe QED corrections\n\nWe use here essentially the same theoretical framework as in Ref. [16], in which we\ncalculated RCs for neutron \u03b2-decay. We therefore give only a brief recapitulation of\n1\n\nThe importance of the nucleon-recoil corrections was emphasized by, e.g., Vogel and Beacom [19].\n\n2\n\n\four formalism, relegating details to Ref. [16].\nOur calculation is based on the Q\u0304/\u039b\u03c7 -expansion scheme, where Q\u0304 \u223c E\u03bd \u2212\u2206N \u2212me\n(\u2206N = mn \u2212mp ) represents a typical four-momentum transfer for incident low-energy\nreactor anti-neutrinos (E\u03bd \u2264 10 MeV), and \u039b\u03c7 \u2243 4\u03c0f\u03c0 \u2248 1 GeV (f\u03c0 = 92.4 MeV\nis the pion-decay constant) is the chiral scale. It is to be noted that the expansion\nparameter in our scheme is very small and that, as explained in more detail below,\nthe lowest order recoil corrections \u223c Q\u0304/mN are of the same order as the lowest order\nradiative corrections; viz., Q\u0304/mN \u223c \u03b1/(2\u03c0) \u223c Q\u0304/\u039b\u03c7 \u223c 10\u22123 , where mN = (mp+mn )/2.\nThe leading order (LO) transition matrix element for the inverse \u03b2-decay, Eq.(1),\nis evaluated ignoring nucleon recoil and radiative corrections. The next-to-leading\norder (NLO) corrections in our counting scheme are the recoil corrections (\u223c Q/mN )\nand the radiative corrections (\u223c \u03b1/(2\u03c0)). The recoil corrections, which include the\n\"weak magnetism\" term, will be specified in Eq.(5) below. For the sake of the transparency of presentation, we shall in this paper separate these corrections from the\nm\u22121\n(kinematic) corrections to the phase-space.\nN\nThe effective lagrangian relevant to our calculation includes the relativistic leptonic weak interaction current and the LO and NLO heavy-baryon lagrangian\nLef f = LQED + LN N + LN N \u03c8\u03c8 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere\nLQED\nLN N\nLN N \u03c8\u03c8\n\n1\n\u03b1\n1\n= \u2212 F \u03bc\u03bdF\u03bc\u03bd \u2212\n(\u2202 *A)2 + 1+ e1 \u03c8\u0304e (i\u03b3 *D)\u03c8e + me \u03c8\u0304e \u03c8e + \u03c8\u0304\u03bd i\u03b3 *\u2202\u03c8\u03bd , (3)\n4\n2\u03beA\n4\u03c0\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03b1\n= N\u0304 1 +\ne2 (1 + \u03c43 ) (iv * D)N ,\n(4)\n8\u03c0!\n\u0015\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0014\u0012\ni\u001a\n\u03b1\nGF Vud h\n\u03b1\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n+\n=\u2212 \u221a\n1+ eV v \u2212 2gA 1+ eA S N\n\u03c8\u0304e \u03b3\u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )\u03c8\u03bd N\u0304\u03c4\n4\u03c0\n4\u03c0\n2\n\u0015 \u001b\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u2190 \u2192\n\u2190 \u2192\n\u2190 \u2192\n1\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc \u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\n+\nN\u0304 \u03c4 i(v v \u2212g )( \u2202 \u2212 \u2202 )\u03bd \u22122i\u03bcV S , S *( \u2202 + \u2202 ) \u22122igA v S *( \u2202 \u2212 \u2202 ) N .\n+\n2mN\n(5)\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nLQED in Eq.(3) is the usual QED lagrangian, where F\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212\u2202\u03bd A\u03bc , and D\u03bc =\n\u2202\u03bc +ieA\u03bc is the covariant derivative; for the gauge parameter \u03beA , we use here \u03beA =\n1 (Feynman gauge). LN N is the heavy-nucleon lagrangian including the photonnucleon interaction, and LN N \u03c8\u03c8 is the low-energy LO and NLO current-current weak\ninteraction. We give in Eq.(5) the explicit forms of NLO nucleon-recoil terms dictated\nby HB\u03c7PT. In the above, gA = 1.267 is the axial coupling constant, while v\u03bc is the\nnucleon velocity vector, and S \u03bc is the nucleon spin; they satisfy v * S = 0. We choose\n3\n\n\fhere v \u03bc = (1, ~0) and S \u03bc = (0, ~\u03c3/2). In the NLO part of the lagrangian the nucleon\nisovector magnetic moment \u03bcV = \u03bcp \u2212\u03bcn = 4.706. The low-energy constants (LECs),\ne1 , e2 , eV and eA , are counter-terms which regulate the ultraviolet (UV) divergences of\nthe virtual photon-loop diagrams. These LECs incorporate the short-range radiative\nphysics that is not probed in a low-energy process. The LECs, e1 and e2 , are related\nto the wave-function renormalization factors of the positron and proton, respectively.\nThe LECs, eV and eA , are related to the Fermi and Gamow-Teller amplitudes. The\nFermi coupling constant, GF = 1.166 \u00d7 10\u22125 GeV\u22122 , is determined from muon decay,\nand the CKM matrix element, |Vud | = 0.97418 \u00b1 0.00027, is given by the PDG [20].\nFor later convenience, we rearrange the LECs in Eq.(5) by rewriting the hadronic\npart in the first line in Eq.(5) as\n\u03b1\nN\u0304 \u03c4 [v \u22122g\u0303A S ]N +\neV N\u0304 \u03c4 + [v \u03bc \u22122g\u0303A S \u03bc ]N + O(\u03b12 ) ,\n4\u03c0\n+\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03b1\n(eA\u2212eV )].\nwhere we have introduced the redefined axial coupling constant, g\u0303A = gA [1+4\u03c0\nAs in the neutron \u03b2-decay case [16], to the order of our concern, gA can always be\nreplaced by g\u0303A . This also applies to the NLO recoil contributions since the m\u22121\nrecoil\nN\ncorrections are of the same order as order-\u03b1 corrections in the adopted counting\nscheme. The order-\u03b1 radiative corrections to the nucleon magnetic moments are for\nthe same reason of higher order in our scheme and hence neglected in this work.\nIn this paper we derive a model-independent expression for the lowest order radiative and recoil corrections to the reaction, \u03bd\u0304e (p\u03bd ) + p(pp ) \u2192 e+ (pe ) + n(pn ), where\nthe four-momentum of each particle is indicated in the parentheses. We shall concentrate on an experimental setup in which none of the particle spins are monitored by\nthe detector. There is one subtle aspect of the above reaction which deserves some\ndiscussion. In experiments, the final state positron will always be accompanied by\n(often undetected) soft bremsstrahlung photons. If the bremsstrahlung photon energy, E\u03b3 is less than the detector resolution, \u2206, the energy recorded by the detector is\nthe sum of the actual outgoing positron energy, Ee , and the bremsstrahlung photon\nenergy, E\u03b3 ; i.e., E = Ee + E\u03b3 is what is measured as the \"detected positron\"\nenergy,\nq\n2\nwith the corresponding \"detected positron\" momentum being |p| = E \u2212 m2e . The\ntwo processes we evaluate are \u03bd\u0304e + p \u2192 e+ + n and \u03bd\u0304e + p \u2192 e+ + \u03b3 + n. Due to\nthe finite detector resolution the second bremsstrahlung process is not observed; it\nonly contributes to the RCs of the first process, i.e., the soft bremsstrahlung photons\nare an integral part of the \"detected positron\". Thus, the first process has become,\n\u03bd\u0304e (p\u03bd ) + p(pp ) \u2192 e+ (p) + n(pn ), where the positron momentum pe has been replaced\nby p in order to indicate that the soft bremsstrahlung process has been incorporated\n\n4\n\n\finto this \"effective\" reaction. The cross section for this \"effective\" reaction is given\nin terms of the effective invariant amplitude M:\nd\u03c3 =\n=\n\n1\n4mp E\u03bd\n\n1 X\nd3 p\nd3 pn\n4 (4)\n(2\u03c0)\n\u03b4\n(p\n+p\n\u2212p\u2212p\n)\n|M|2\n\u03bd\np\nn\n(2\u03c0)3 2E (2\u03c0)3 2En\n2 spins\n\nZ\n\nGF Vud\n\u221a\n2\n\n!2\n\nh\n\ni\n\nf (E) (1+3gA2 ) G1 (\u03b2) + (1\u2212gA2 ) G2 (\u03b2)\u03b2 cos \u03b8e d(cos \u03b8e ) ,\n\n(6)\n\nq\n\nwhere \u03b2 = |p|/E = E 2 \u2212 m2e /E is the velocity of the outgoing \"detected positron\"\nfor a given incident (anti-)neutrino beam energy, E\u03bd and detector reading, E; cos(\u03b8e ) =\np\u0302\u03bd * p\u0302, and f (E) is the phase-space factor to be discussed later in the text (see,\nEq. (17)). The two velocity-dependent functions, Gi (\u03b2) (i = 1, 2), are written up to\nNLO as\nGi (\u03b2) = 1 +\n\n1 recoil\n\u03b1 rad\nGi (\u03b2) +\nG\n(\u03b2) ,\n2\u03c0\nmN i\n\n(7)\n\nHere Girad (\u03b2) (see, Eqs. (10) and (11)) represent the lowest-order radiative corrections,\nand Girecoil (\u03b2) (see, Eq. (18)), which will be evaluated in the next section, represent\nthe recoil corrections arising from the lagrangian in Eq.(5). The calculation of the\nfunction Girad (\u03b2) is described next.\nFor the analysis of the radiative corrections, we explicitly distinguish between the\noutgoing positron and the bremsstrahlung photon. There are two distinct categories\nof radiative corrections, the bremsstrahlung and the virtual photon loop corrections.\nThe corresponding Feynman diagrams are shown in Fig. 1. Since O(\u03b1) and O(m\u22121\nN )\nare of the same order in our counting scheme, the invariant matrix element, Mbr for\nbremsstrahlung is evaluated assuming En = mn .

[16]. We also remark that Eq.(9) was derived earlier by Fukugita\nand Kubota [9], who used the S-M approach [10, 11] and a finite photon mass in order\nto regulate the infrared (IR) singularity. In the integration over the bremsstrahlung\nphoton energy in Eq.(8) the maximum photon energy occurs when \u1ebce = me , i.e.,\n\u1ebc\u03b3max = \u1ebc \u2212 me .3 In this context, the same question again arises as to whether\nor not the experiment can distinguish between the two final states, n + e+ + \u03b3 and\nn+e+ . If the detector resolution in the experimental setup is such that one can detect\nphotons with an energy \u1ebc\u03b3 in the interval \u2206 \u2264 \u1ebc\u03b3 \u2264 \u1ebc\u03b3max , we should integrate the\nbremsstrahlung photon energy \u1ebc\u03b3 = |k\u0303| from 0 to \u2206 in Eq. (8). However, if the\nexperiment is unable to distinguish these two final states, we should integrate from 0\nto \u1ebc\u03b3max . In order to compare with earlier works, we concentrate here on the latter\ncase. The integral over the radiative photon spectrum invariably gives rise to an IR\nsingularity. We use dimensional regularization to deal with the IR singularity; some\ndetails regarding the bremsstrahlung integral are presented in the appendix. As is\nwell known, the IR singularity appearing in Eq.(8) is cancelled by the contributions\nfrom virtual photon-loop diagrams in accordance with Bloch and Nordsieck [17], see\nalso [18]. The evaluation of the loop diagrams in dimensional regularization can be\nfound in the literature, see, e.g., Ref. [16]. It is notable that, apart from the so-called\n\"Coulomb factor\" \u03c0 2 /\u03b2, which arises in, e.g. neutron \u03b2-decay from a photon-loop\nP\n\n3\n\nThe approximate integrals considered in Ref. [7] give the analytic expression in Ref. [9] provided\nthe lower limits of the integrals are changed from 1 MeV to me .\n\n6\n\n\fdiagram, the matrix element given by these virtual photon loops is identical to the\none in neutron \u03b2-decay.\nThe UV-divergencies originating from the photon loop diagrams are regulated by\nthe LECs in the lagrangian. These LECs are renormalized by the usual effective field\ntheoretical method based on dimensional regularization of the loop integrals, see e.g.,\nRefs. [12, 22]. The finite LECs renormalized at the scale \u03bc are\n2\neR\nV,A (\u03bc )\n\n1\n3\n3\n2\n\u03bc2\n= eV,A \u2212 (e1 + e2 ) +\n\u2212 \u03b3E + ln(4\u03c0) + 1 + ln\n2\n2 d\u22124\n2\nm2N\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n!\n\n.\n\nThe LEC, eR\n(\u03bc2 ), which was introduced by Ando et al. [16] in the evaluation of the\nV\nRC for neutron \u03b2-decay, subsumes short distance physics not probed at low energies\nand depends on the regularization scale \u03bc.\nCombining the bremsstrahlung\nq and virtual photon-loops contributions calculated\nto order \u03b1, and noting that \u03b2\u0303 = \u1ebc 2 \u2212 m2e /\u1ebc = \u03b2 + O(m\u22121\nN ), we obtain, neglecting\n\u22121\nrad\nrad\nO(mN ) contributions, Gi (\u03b2\u0303) \u2243 Gi (\u03b2), i = 1, 2, appearing in Eq.(7). Dropping\nterms of O(\u03b1 m\u22121\nN ), we choose to write the results in the following form:\n\u0014\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03b1 R 2\n\u03b1\n\u03b1 rad\nG (\u03b2) = 1+ \u1ebdV (\u03bc ) 1+ \u03b4out (\u03b2)\n(10)\n1+\n2\u03c0 1\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n\u03b1 R 2\n\u03b1\n\u03b1 rad\n\u03b4\u0303out (\u03b2) ,\n(11)\nG2 (\u03b2) = 1 +\n\u1ebdV (\u03bc ) 1 +\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\nwhere the \"inner\" corrections, which are independent of \u03b2, are encoded in the LEC\n5\n2\nR\n2\nR\n2\n\u1ebdR\nV (\u03bc ) and defined as \u1ebdV (\u03bc ) = eV (\u03bc ) + 4 .

We also note that \u03b4out \u2261 h(\u00ca, E0 ), where h(\u00ca, E0 ) is the function\nintroduced by Sirlin [23].\nAs mentioned, eR\n(\u03bc2 ) also appears in the expression for the RC for neutron \u03b2V\ndecay. Therefore, it is in principle possible to determine eR\n(\u03bc2 ) using relevant highV\nprecision low-energy data involving baryons. Due to lack of useful experimental data,\nAndo et al. [16] determined eR\n(\u03bc2 ) at \u03bc = mN by comparing their results for neutron\nV\n\u03b2-decay with those obtained in the S-M approach [10, 11].\n\n3\n\nThe m\u22121 recoil corrections\nN\n\nAs mentioned, these corrections have two different origins. One comes from the\nlagrangian itself, and the other arises from the expansion of the kinematic factors\nin the phase-space integral. Below we treat these two types of recoil corrections\nseparately and compare our results with those in Ref. [19]. It is to be noted again\nthat, in evaluating the O(m\u22121\nN ) corrections, we can neglect O(\u03b1) radiative effects,\nsince O(\u03b1 m\u22121\n)\nterms\nare\nof\nhigher\norder in our counting scheme. One can, therefore,\nN\nassume that the outgoing positron energy, Ee \u2248 E, and correspondingly, the positron\nvelocity, \u03b2e \u2248 \u03b2.\nKinematic (phase space) corrections\nThe phase space factor, f (E), appearing in Eq.(6) to the lowest order (LO) in the\nm\u22121\nexpansion is given by f (\u1ebc) = \u1ebc 2 \u03b2\u0303/\u03c0 with the neutron regarded as being static,\nN\ni.e., En = mn +O(m\u22121\n). To NLO, the above expression for f (E) needs to be corrected\nN\nto incorporate the kinetic energy of the recoil neutron from the relation En = mn +\n(p\u03bd \u2212pe )2 /(2mN )+O(m\u22122\n). Corresponding to this change in En , we have\nN\nE = E\u03bd \u2212\u2206N \u2212(p\u03bd \u2212pe )2 /(2mn ) + * * * = \u1ebc \u2212 (p\u03bd \u2212pe )2 /(2mn ) + * * *\n\"\n!\n#\n1\n\u22062N \u2212 m2e\n\u22122\n= \u1ebc 1 \u2212\n+ O(mN ) ,\nE\u03bd (1\u2212 \u03b2\u0303 cos \u03b8e ) +\nmN\n2\u1ebc\n\n(14)\n\nwhere, as earlier, \u1ebc = E\u03bd \u2212 \u2206N , and the positron velocity becomes\n1 1\u2212 \u03b2\u0303 2\n\u03b2 = \u03b2\u0303 1 \u2212\nmN\n\u03b2\u0303 2\n\"\n\n!\n\n\u22062 \u2212 m2e\n+ O(m\u22122\n) ,\nE\u03bd (1\u2212 \u03b2\u0303 cos \u03b8e ) + N\nN\n2\u1ebc\n!\n\n8\n\n#\n\n(15)\n\n\fq\n\nwhere \u03b2\u0303 = \u1ebc 2 \u2212 m2e /\u1ebc. Note that the positron energy, E and the velocity, \u03b2, are\nequal to the recoil-corrected Ee(1) and ve(1) in Ref. [19], respectively. Reflecting these\nchanges, the phase space integral in Eq.(6) needs to be corrected as follows:\nZ\n\nf (E) mn + En\n(dF )\n\u03b4(F )\n4\u03c0\nEn\n\u0012\n\ndF\ndE\n\n\u0013\n\nF =0\n\n!\u22121\n\nh\n\ni\n\n(1 + 3gA2 ) + (1 \u2212 gA2 )\u03b2 cos \u03b8e , (16)\n\nwhere F = E\u03bd \u2212 \u2206N \u2212 E \u2212 (p\u03bd \u2212 pe )2 /(2mN ) + * * *.

As noted\nN\nbefore, the radiative corrections to these additional terms in the Lagrangian are of\nhigher order than NLO in our counting and hence need not be considered here. Evaluating the NLO lagrangian recoil correction contributions, illustrated in diagram (a)\nin Fig. 1, we obtain the recoil terms in Eq.(7)\n1 \u2212 2gA \u03bcV + gA2\n1 + 2gA \u03bcV + gA2\n= \u03b2 E\n\u2212\nE\n\u03bd\n1 + 3gA2\n1 + 3gA2\n!\n!\n2\n2\n1\n\u2212\n2g\n\u03bc\n+\ng\n1\n+\n2g\n\u03bc\n+\ng\nA\nV\nA\nV\nA\nA\n\u2212 E\u03bd\n.\nG2recoil (\u03b2) = E\n1 \u2212 gA2\n1 \u2212 gA2\n\nG1recoil (\u03b2)\n\n!\n\n2\n\n!\n\n(18)\n\nComparing these results with those obtained for neutron \u03b2-decay [16], we note that\nthere are several relative sign differences.4 Apart from the m\u22121\nN phase-space cor\u22121\nrections in neutron \u03b2-decay, the mN corrections (arising from the Lagrangian m\u22121\nN\ninteraction terms) relevant to the neutron life-time are contained in the C0 factor in\nEq.(14) of Ref. [16]. Noting that in neutron beta-decay Eemax = E\u03bd + Ee + O(m\u22121\nN ),\nwe may rewrite the C0 factor as\n1\nC0 (Ee ) = 1 +\nmN\n4\n\n(\n\n2\n\n\u03b2 Ee\n\n1 + 2\u03bcV gA + gA2\n1 + 3gA2\n\n!\n\n+ E\u03bd\n\n1 \u2212 2\u03bcV gA + gA2\n1 + 3gA2\n\n!)\n\nThis is in contrast to the order-\u03b1 RCs which are universal at NLO in effective field theory.\n\n9\n\n\fComparison of C0 with G1recoil (\u03b2) in Eq.(18) clearly indicates that the m\u22121\nrecoil corN\nrections are not identical for the neutron \u03b2-decay and the inverse \u03b2-decay. Moreover,\nsince the weak-magnetism term is dominant, the difference between C0 and G1recoil (\u03b2)\nare of the same magnitude as the corrections themselves.\nCombining the m\u22121\nJacobian factor in the square brackets in Eq. (17), and the reN\ncoil correction arising from the lagrangian, Eq. (18), we confirm the recoil corrections\ngiven in Eqs. (12) and (13) in Ref. [19]. We prefer to keep these two m\u22121\ncorrections\nN\nseparate since one is of a kinematical origin (phase space correction), whereas the\nother is of a dynamical origin arising from the transition matrix element.\n\n4\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this paper we have derived a model-independent expression for the radiative and\nm\u22121\ncorrections for the low-energy anti-neutrino proton reaction to next-to-leadingN\norder in an effective field theory approach. We have shown that short-distance physics\nnot probed in this low-energy reaction can be subsumed into a single low-energy constant eR\n(\u03bc2 ). In the Q\u0304/\u039b\u03c7 -expansion scheme adopted here, the O(\u03b1) and O(Q/mN )\nV\ncorrections are considered to be of the same order for the reactor anti-neutrino energy range. We have found that the m\u22121\ncorrections appearing in Eq. (18), which\nN\noriginate from the lagrangian Eq. (5), are different from the m\u22121\ncorrections found\nN\nin neutron \u03b2-decay, see e.g., Ref. [16]. Therefore, to the order under consideration, it\nis not advisable to write the inverse beta-decay cross section (or the positron yield)\nin terms of the neutron mean life \u03c4n , as advocated in Ref. [7].\nThe short-distance hadronic physics associated with the LEC, eR\n(\u03bc2 ), was extenV\n2\nsively discussed in Refs. [10, 11]. The processes involved in eR\nV (\u03bc ) were studied from\nan effective field theoretical perspective in Ref. [16]. In principle, we should be able\nto determine the LEC, eR\n(\u03bc2 ), from high-precision experimental data. Relegating\nV\n2\nthis determination to future study, we choose here to estimate eR\nV (\u03bc ) at the scale\n\u03bc = mN by comparing the short-distance radiative corrections calculated in the S-M\napproach [10, 11] and the expressions obtained in EFT in Ref. [16]. The result is\n!\n\nmZ\nmp\n2\n\u1ebdR\n+ln\n+2C +Ag = 18.31 \u2212 .25 + 1.78 \u2212 0.34 = 19.5,\nV (mN ) = 4 ln\nmp\nmA\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(19)\n\nwhere, for the sake of definiteness, the value of the axial matching mass mA =1.2 GeV\nhas been used although its value involves uncertainty [10, 11]. With this value of\n2\n\u1ebdR\nV (mN ), the correction term involving LEC in Eqs. (10) and (11) is estimated to be\n2\n(\u03b1/2\u03c0) \u1ebdR\nV (mN ) \u2243 0.023. The dominant first term in Eq. (19) arises from well-known\n10\n\n\fadditional box diagrams with Z-exchange, replacing the photon-exchange, in electroweak theory [10, 11]. This electro-weak physics can be naturally included in our\napproach. However, for an easy comparison with the neutron beta-decay radiative\ncorrections evaluated in Ref. [16], we prefer to keep this contribution in the above\nLEC. As for the last two terms in Eq. (19), we remark that Ag involves genuine\nshort-distance hadron-structure physics, whereas the constant C arises from photonloop diagrams in which the photon couples to the nucleon magnetic moments and\nalso from the hadronic form factors. The long-range parts of these corrections are\nnaturally included in EFT at higher orders than considered in this paper.\nAs a final comment we note that in our work we have used the value of the\nFermi constant GF determined from the muon lifetime measurement. The theoretical\nexpression for GF is evaluated in standard electroweak theory, and it naturally in2\ncludes log-terms involving mZ . These log-terms appear in our expression for eR\nV (\u03bc ),\nEq. (19), and was also considered in Ref. [16], see e.g., Refs. [10, 11] for details.\nIn summary the integrated cross section for reaction (1) is\n\u1ebc 2 \u03b2\u0303\n\u03b1\n(1 + 3gA2 ) 1 + G1rad (\u03b2\u0303)\n\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n(\n!\n!\nh\n1\n1 + \u03b2\u0303 2\n\u22062N \u2212 m2e\nrecoil\n\u00d7 1+\nG\n(\u03b2\u0303) \u2212 \u1ebc \u2212\nE\u03bd +\nmN 1\n2\u1ebc\n\u03b2\u0303 2\n!\n)\n2\ni\n1 \u2212 gA E\u03bd\n(2 + \u03b2\u0303 2 )\n+\n1 + 3gA2\n3\n\n\u03c3 = (GF Vud )2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(20)\n\nq\n\nwhere as before, \u1ebc = E\u03bd \u2212 (mn \u2212 mp ) and \u03b2\u0303 = \u1ebc \u2212 m2e /\u1ebc, and where all m\u22121\nN\ncorrections in Eq.(20) except G1recoil (\u03b2) of Eq.(18) originate from the phase-space\nfactor f (E), Eq.(17).\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to V.
