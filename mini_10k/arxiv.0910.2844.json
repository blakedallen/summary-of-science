In a seminal experiment, Gabelli\net al. [1] measured the ac-conductance of a mesoscopic\nRC-circuit. Measuring the in and out of phase components of the ac-conductance at GHz frequency, they confirmed theoretical predictions for the coherent transport\nof noninteracting electrons [2, 3, 4]. General interest in\ntime- or frequency-dependent properties of mesoscopic\nsystems is driven by efforts to measure and manipulate\nquantum coherent systems as quickly as possible, for instance, for applications in quantum information transmission and processing. An important building block for\nsuch experiments may be provided by a coherent singleelectron source recently realized [5]. Furthermore, timeor frequency-dependent measurements can yield additional information about internal time and energy scales\nthat are not accessible via the time-averaged dc-current.\nA cornerstone for many recent theoretical considerations of the time-independent dc-current was laid in the\n1992 paper of Meir and Wingreen [6], who derived a\nLandauer-type formula, giving the current through a central interacting region in terms of local Keldysh Green's\nfunctions of the central region (and the tunnel-coupling\nand Fermi-functions of the leads). In this paper we extend this approach to the finite frequency case and derive an expression for the current response to a small\nac-voltage excitation, which is applied across the central interacting region in addition to a static dc-bias,\ni.e., the linear ac-conductance in a nonequilibrium situation. As in the Meir-Wingreen approach we derive a\nformula for the current in terms of 'local' objects, but\nin our case these are no longer the usual Green's functions, i.e., expectation values of two-operator objects, but\ncontain four electronic operators. The actual evaluation\nof these central objects may in principle be performed\nemploying various techniques and approximations. The\napproach lends itself, however, to a combination with a\ndiagrammatic calculation perturbative in the interaction\nstrength [7], as we demonstrate in an examplary calcula-\n\ntion for electron-phonon coupling.\nBefore turning to the general approach, we note some\nprevious works that have considered special cases. For\nvanishing electron-phonon coupling our approach reproduces calculations based on the scattering matrix method\n[2, 4, 8]. Those calculations rely on a noninteracting\nsingle-particle picture, but can be amended to capture\nscreening by incorporating the effects of induced charges\non the internal potentials in a self-consistent manner.\nThe current response to a fixed internal potential as calculated by the scattering method (or by our approach)\nis then used as an input for these calculations. Another\nroute to finite frequency calculations starts from an expression of the current in Green's function formulation\nfor completely general time dependence of the parameters [9]. Progress can then again be made for the noninteracting case [9], or employing special approximations\nto the interacting self-energy and Green's function [10].\nKubo relations naturally link the linear ac-conductance\nto current-current correlators. Indeed, as pointed out\nin [11] its real part is related to the asymmetric part\nof the frequency dependent current-noise for a static dcbias. Derivations of a general Meir-Wingreen type formula for the noise, however, have been restricted to the\nsymmetrized noise and, furthermore, consider the noninteracting case [12] or focus on the zero frequency limit\n[13, 14].\nSystem.- We consider transport through a central region, for instance a quantum dot, between a left and\nright lead. While electrons in the leads can be considered as noninteracting, within the central region there\nmight be electron-electron or (as considered in the specific calculations in this paper) electron-phonon interaction. The Hamiltonian P\nof the system can then be written as \u0124 = \u0124central + \u03b1=L/R (\u0124res,\u03b1 + \u0124T,\u03b1 ) . Lead\nP\nHamiltonian \u0124res,\u03b1 = k \u000fk\u03b1 \u0109\u2020k\u03b1 \u0109k\u03b1 and tunnel HamiltoP\nnian \u0124T,\u03b1 = k, n Vk\u03b1,n \u0109\u2020k\u03b1 d\u02c6n + c.c. are of the standard\nP\nform and the central part, \u0124central = n \u03b5n d\u02c6\u2020n d\u02c6n + \u0124int\nmay include electron-electron or electron-phonon cou-\n\n\f2\npling within \u0124int . We want to consider the nonequilibrium situation, where on top of a finite dc-bias a small\nac-excitation voltage V\u03b2 of frequency \u03c9ac is applied to\nlead \u03b2. The resulting finite frequency current I\u03b1 flowing\nfrom lead \u03b1 to the central region is given by the linear\nac-conductance, I\u03b1 (\u03c9ac ) = G\u03b1\u03b2 (\u03c9ac ) V\u03b2 (\u03c9ac ) . Considering linear response with respect to the ac-excitation, we\ncan use Kubo formalism, but due to the finite dc-bias\nthe expectation values in the Kubo-formalism have to be\ntaken for the nonequilibrium finite-bias state. The standard Kubo approach directly yields the linear conductance G\u03b1\u03b2 in terms of a (retarded) current-current correlator, G\u03b1\u03b2 (\u03c9ac ) = [K\u03b1\u03b2 (\u03c9ac ) \u2212 K\u03b1\u03b2 (0)] /(i\u03c9ac ) , where\nZ\nh\ni\ni \u221e\ndt ei\u03c9ac t h I\u02c6\u03b1 (t), I\u02c6\u03b2 (0) i .\n(1)\nK\u03b1\u03b2 (\u03c9ac ) = \u2212\n~ 0\nThe current operators are of similar form as the tunnel\nHamiltonian,\n\u2212\n\n1 \u02c6\ni\ni\n \u0307\nI\u03b1 (t) = N\u0302\u03b1 (t) = [\u0124, N\u0302\u03b1 ] = [\u0124T,\u03b1 , N\u0302\u03b1 ]\n(\u2212e)\n~\n~\niX\n(Vk\u03b1,n \u0109\u2020k\u03b1 d\u02c6n \u2212 Vn,k\u03b1 d\u02c6\u2020n \u0109k\u03b1 ) .(2)\n= \u2212\n~\nkn\n\nThe correlator K\u03b1\u03b2 (t, t0 ) = K\u03b1\u03b2 (t \u2212 t0 , 0) has the same\nstructure as a retarded Green's function, but with a\npair of creation and destruction operators for each of\nthe current operators at the two time variables, see the\nschematic diagrammatic representation in Fig. 1. Each\ncurrent operator appears as an external vertex with one\nlead-electron line (dotted line) and one dot-electron line\n(double line), one of them entering, one leaving the vertex\n[15]. The two possibilities (for each vertex) carry signs\naccording to Eq. (2). In general, in between the four\nlegs starting from the two vertices there will be a complicated diagram involving many interaction lines, as indicated by the shaded box in Fig. 1. The simplest type of\ndiagram, however, is encountered in the non-interacting\ncase. Then all operators are directly contracted, resulting\nin two Green's function running antiparallel (one starts at\nt going to t0 , the other goes from t0 to t). Langreth's theorem then yields so-called analytical continuation rules,\ngiving the proper combination of nonequilibrium Green's\nfunction for the different Keldysh components of the\nproduct [7]. For instance, the object with two antiparallel Green's functions C(t, t0 ) = A(t, t0 )B(t0 , t) has the\nretarded component of C R (t, t0 ) = A< (t, t0 )B A (t0 , t) +\nAR (t, t0 )B < (t, t0 ) = 12 (AK B A + AR B K ). These rules\ncorrespond to applying the standard rules for Keldysh\nindices at the outer vertices. (We use the following matrix representation\nthe nonequilibrium\nGreen's func\u0012 R K \u0013 of \u0012\n\u0013\nG G\nG11 G12\ntions\n=\n, where the Keldysh\nG21 G22\n0 GA\nGreen's function component G21 vanishes by construction.)

One leadelectron line (dotted line) and one dot-electron line (double\nline) are connected to each outer vertex. The two contributions in the current vertex, Eq. (2), corresponding to an inor outgoing dot-electron line (and vice versa for the lead electron) yield different signs for the various configurations. The\nfour diagrams at the right show the possible combinations of\nKeldysh indices at the inner legs, with the lower two vanishing. A single solid line stands for either dot-electron or\nlead-electron lines.\n\nfind four possible combination of Keldysh indices on the\ninner legs of the correlator loop, see Fig. 1. Note that\ntwo of these combinations would include the vanishing\nGreen's function component G21 without further interaction lines added to the simple loop diagram. In that\ncase, the Langreth result is directly recovered. In the\nfollowing we will argue, that the two latter index combinations vanish also after including all interaction lines\nand we are left with only the upper two combinations in\nFig. 1.\nTo start with, we consider only one additional interaction line. Then it is easy to see that this statement\nholds, simply by constructing all diagrams according to\nthe indexing rules at the vertices. Vanishing diagrams\nare then found for two reasons. First, the application\nof the Keldysh indexing rules at the vertices may lead\nto the appearance of a line corresponding to the vanishing Green's function component G21 . Secondly, diagrams\nmay also vanish due to the fact that the appearance of\nan advanced or retarded Green's function between two\nvertices implies a fixed order of the time variables of the\ntwo interconnected vertices. Such a time order can lead\nto a logical contradiction, if, for instance, the Green's\nfunctions implied that t1 < t2 < t3 and t3 < t1 .\nTo exploit this property systematically for all higher\norder diagrams, we introduce the notion of a time-arrow\nline, which appears in diagrams indicating a fixed timeordering of the vertices along this line, see Fig. 2. Such\na line runs parallel to G11 = GR and antiparallel to\nG22 = GA . Analysing the 12 different possible index combinations at a vertex (we consider the electronphonon case here, but the argument is general and relies\non the Keldysh indexing rules at the vertices only) we\nfind that if a time arrow-line runs into a vertex, there\nwill always also be such a line leaving the vertex. In\nconsequence a time-arrow line will never stop at an internal vertex, but will run through a diagram until it\n\n\f3\n\n1\n2 1 1\n1\n1\n\n1\n2 1 2\n2 2\n1 1\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n2\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2 2\n\nFigure 2: Time-arrow lines, running parallel to G11 or antiparallel to G22 , do not stop internally, but progress through\nany possible internal vertex. They may hit themselves, forming a closed loop, which indicates a logical contradiction in\nthe time ordering, or end at the external vertices. Additional\ntime-arrow lines (cf. the shaded box) may also exist and enforce vanishing of a diagram if they form a loop.\n\nhits an outer vertex (where it may end or go on) or until it hits itself and forms a closed loop. Such a closed\nloop will imply a logical contradiction within the time\nordering as discussed above, and the corresponding diagram vanishes. Consider now a combination of Keldysh\nindices at the outer vertices as in the diagram shown in\nFig. 2. Due to the vanishing of G21 we can infer that two\ntime-arrow lines start at the left external vertex, while at\nthe right vertex we can have a time-arrow line starting\nor crossing through the vertex. As the time-arrow lines\ndo not stop internally and can not stop at either of the\ntwo external vertices in this specific diagram, they have\nto form a closed loop. Analysing the external vertices in\nthis manner, we can thus state that some index combinations will necessarily result in time-arrow loops and are,\nhence, forbidden. For the case of interest here, the two\nlower diagrams of Fig. 1 are of this type and vanish.\nSeparating out the leads.- Each of the two external\nvertices is connected to a lead-electron line. Moving away\nfrom the vertices along these lines, we will encounter a\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c9ac\n\nE+E'\n2\n1\n\nE\n\n\u03a0 E'\n\nE+E'+\u03c9ac\n\n2\n2\n\nE+\u03c9ac\n\n\u03c9ac\n\n\u2212\n=\n+\n+\n\n2\n1\n\n2\n1\n\n2\n1\n2\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n111\n100\n\n112\n200\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n112\n100\n\n2\n\n2\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n111\n100\n\n112\n100\n\n2\n\n2\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n11 000\n00\n111\n\n1\n\n2\n\n112 000\n111\n100\n2\n1\n\n2\n\n112\n100\n2\n\n2\n\ntunneling event changing the lead-electron line to a dotelectron line [16]. Note, that there can be no interaction\nline in between the external vertex and the first tunneling, as interaction is only present within the dot region.\nThe Green's function corresponding to the considered\nline is now split into a product of a lead-lead Green's\nfunction, a tunneling matrix element and a dot-electron\nGreen's function. The Keldysh indexing of those Green's\nfunctions follows the rules of matrix multiplication in\nKeldysh space, see Fig. 3. This split-off procedure has to\nbe performed for the four possible orientations of dot and\nlead lines at the external vertices (taking account of the\nproper signs according to Eq. (2)). We proceed by evaluating the sums over lead states contained in the outer current vertices and in the inner tunneling vertices marked\nby crosses in Fig. 3. For that, we change from time to frequency/energy domain. We introduce the frequency E,\nwhich encircles the loop, and the energy E 0 exchanged\nwithin the central object between upper and lower line\n(see Fig. 3). The summations are then executed under\nthe standard assumption of the wide-band limit to yield\nP\nP\n2 K\n\u03b1\n2 R/A\n= \u2213 2i \u0393\u03b1 ,\nk |V\u03b1 | g\u03b1 = \u2212i\u0393\u03b1 (1 \u2212 2f ) ,\nk |V\u03b1 | g\u03b1\nR/A/K\nare the bare lead Green's functions, f \u03b1\nwhere g\u03b1\nthe Fermi-distribution function of lead\nP\u03b1 and \u0393\u03b1 is the\ncoupling strength defined as \u0393\u03b1 = 2\u03c0 k |V\u03b1 |2 . For ease\nof notation we consider a single level in the central region\nhere and in the following. The simple extension to the\ngeneral case is discussed below.\nSeparating out the leads in that manner we are left\nwith a central object \u03a0 with four legs of dot-electron\nlines, which includes all possible further interaction lines\nin its central block, see Fig. 3. Starting from the two\nremaining diagrams of Fig. 1, we can group together all\ncontributions with the same indices on the central object \u03a0. We find that all but three contributions cancel,\nand the final result for the frequency-dependent retarded\ncurrent-current correlator can be written as\nZ\nZ\ni\ne2\ndE\ndE 0 h \u03b2\n\u03b2\nC\nK\u03b1\u03b2\n= \u2212i \u0393\u03b1 \u0393\u03b2\nfE \u2212 fE+\u03c9\n\u00d7 (3)\nac\n~\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n\u00022 2\n\u0003\n\u03b1\n2 2\n\u03b1\n1 2\n\u00d7 1 \u03a01 + (1 \u2212 2fE+E\n0 +\u03c9 )2 \u03a01 \u2212 (1 \u2212 2fE+E 0 )1 \u03a01\nac\n\n2\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n111\n000\n111\n1\n1 000\n1\n2\n\n2\n2\n\nFigure 3: Each correlator contains four combinations of in/out-tunneling at the outer vertices. The dot-lead Green's\nfunctions are split into lead-lead and dot-dot Green's functions, so that the correlator can be expressed in terms of a\ncentral object \u03a0 containing dot operators only, represented\nby gray boxes (with Keldysh indices at the legs indicated).\nFor example, 21 \u03a021 occurs in the first and last line, and these\ndiagrams contribute to the term displayed in Eq. (3).\n\nplus extra terms for the diagonal conductances, stemming from a direct contraction of lead operators of\nR\n2\ndirect\n\u03b1\nA\nthe outer vertices, K\u03b1\u03b1\n= \u2212 e~ \u0393\u03b1 dE\n2\u03c0 [fE+\u03c9ac GE +\n\u03b1\nR\nC\ndirect\nfE\u2212\u03c9ac GE ] , so that K\u03b1\u03b2 = K\u03b1\u03b2 + \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 K\u03b1\u03b1 .\nThis constitutes a general expression for the acconductance in terms of a central 'dot-operator only' object, which is the equivalent to the dot Green's functions\nin the Meir-Wingreen result. This central object \u03a0 is\na Keldysh-type diagram with four external legs. Two\ndot-electron lines enter the diagram and two leave it.\nWe arrange the diagram so that the lines entering are\nplaced at the upper left and lower right corner. Due\nto energy conservation the energies carried by the four\nexternal lines can be parametrized by three parameters\n\n\f4\nE, E 0 , and \u03c9ac as indicated in Fig. 3. The four external\nlegs carry Keldysh indices as indicated on \u03a0. The central\nobject \u03a0 then contains all possible diagrams within these\nspecifications, fully including tunneling and interaction.\nIf we wish to consider several levels within the central\ndot-region, each dot-line carries extra level indices, in\ngeneral differing at start and end (due to tunneling to\nthe leads and back into a different level). The couplings\n\u0393\u03b1 become matrices in these dot indices and the trace is\ntaken over the whole expression. For instance, the first\n2k\nterm of Eq. (3) would change into \u0393\u03b1, ij \u0393\u03b2, kl i2\nj1 \u03a01l with\nsummation over all level indices i, j, k, l. In the following,\nwe illustrate the application of our formula for two simple\nexamples.\nResonant level model.- Without interaction, there are\nno phononic lines connecting the upper and lower line of\n\u03a0 and energy exchange between these lines is not possible. The superfluous E 0 integral is then cancelled by a\n\u03b4-function guaranteeing energy conservation. The terms\nin Eq. (3) with 22 \u03a021 and 11 \u03a021 vanish (since they would\ncontain G21 = 0), while the 21 \u03a021 contribution and the\ndirect part immediately yield\n\n(0)\nG\u03b1\u03b2\n\nZ\ndE \u03b2\ne2 \u0393\u03b1 \u0393\u03b2\nT R, T\n(f\n\u2212 fE\u03b2 )GA,\n=\nE GE+\u03c9ac\n~ \u03c9ac\n2\u03c0 E+\u03c9ac\nZ\ndE \u03b2\ne2 i\u0393\u03b1\nT\nT\n+\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2\n(f\n\u2212 f \u03b2 )(GA,\n\u2212 GR,\nE\nE+\u03c9ac ) .\n~ \u03c9ac\n2\u03c0 E+\u03c9ac E\n\nThe noninteracting dot Green's functions including the\ntunneling self-energy are GR/A, T (E) = [E \u2212 \u03b5 \u00b1 i(\u0393L +\n\u0393R )/2]\u22121 . We thus recover the result that can also be\nderived using methods specialized to the non-interacting\ncase, viz. the fully time-dependent Green's function approach of Ref. [9] or scattering matrix theory [4].\nSecond-order in e-ph coupling.- We now consider coupling to P\nphononic modes of frequency \u03c9\u03ba , i.e. we take\n\u2020 \u02c6\u2020 \u02c6\n\u2020\n\u0124int =\n\u03ba [g\u03ba (\u00e2\u03ba + \u00e2\u03ba )d d + ~\u03c9\u03ba \u00e2\u03ba \u00e2\u03ba ] . We find that\nin second order in the e-ph coupling g\u03ba , i.e., with one\nphonon line included in the diagram, there are three different type of contributions. Firstly , we can replace one\nof the bare dot-electron Green's function by one dressed\nwith a phonon line, see Fig. 4. For the evaluation of\nthis type of diagrams, we accordingly replace bare by\ndressed Green's function in the zeroth-order result and\nT\nT A, ph A, T\nexpand to second order, e.g., GA,\n\u2192 GA,\nGE ,\nE\nE \u03a3E\nwhere the self-energies \u03a3ph are the lowest order Fock- and\nHartree-terms, which depend on the bare phonon propR/A/K\nagator D\u03ba\n. Secondly, there are contributions with\n\none crossing phonon line, which yield\nZ\nZ\ni\ndE 0 h \u03b2\ne2\ndE\n(2), cross\n\u03b2\nfE \u2212 fE+\u03c9\n\u00d7\nK\u03b1\u03b2\n= \u2212i \u0393\u03b1 \u0393\u03b2\nac\n~\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\nX g 2 A, T R, T nh A, T\nK, T\n\u03ba\nA\n\u00d7i\nGE GE+\u03c9ac GE+E 0 D\u03ba,\nE 0 GE+E 0 +\u03c9ac\n2\n\u03ba\ni\nT\nR, T\nA, T\nR, T\nR\nK\n+ GK,\nE+E 0 D\u03ba, E 0 GE+E 0 +\u03c9ac+ GE+E 0 D\u03ba, E 0 GE+E 0 +\u03c9ac\nh\ni\nA, T\nA, T\n\u03b1\nA\n+ (1 \u2212 2fE+E\n0 +\u03c9 )GE+E 0 D\u03ba, E 0 GE+E 0 +\u03c9\nac\nac\nh\ni\nR, T\nR, T\n\u03b1\nR\n\u2212 (1 \u2212 2fE+E 0 )GE+E 0 D\u03ba, E 0 GE+E 0 +\u03c9ac ,\nwhere the three terms in the square brackets correspond\nto the three different indexing variations of \u03a0 in Eq. (3).\nThe contribution from the third type of diagram in Fig. 4\nvanishes in the dc-limit in linear response and will not be\ndiscussed further here.\n\nFigure 4: Three types of second-order diagrams. Diagrams\nwith one Green's function dressed with a phonon line (left),\ndiagrams with one phonon line crossing the loop (middle),\nand Hartree-type diagrams of two electronic loops coupled by\na phononic line (right).\n\nThe equivalence of the Meir-Wingreen result to the dclimit of our result is most easily seen for the special case\nof linear response. Then the explicit difference of Fermi\nfunctions f \u03b2 in the last two equations results in a derivative, while all other Fermi and Green's functions can be\ntaken at equilibrium and vanishing \u03c9ac . Contributions\nfrom diagrams with one crossing phonon line can then be\nwritten\nZ\ni\ne2 \u0393\u03b1 \u0393\u03b2\ndE \u03b20 R, Th R, ph\n(2),cross\nph\nG\u03b1\u03b2\n=i\nfE GE \u03a3E \u2212 \u03a3A,\nGA\nE.\nE\n~ \u0393L + \u0393R 2\u03c0\nExpanding the Green's function in the Meir-Wingreen\nresult to second order in the electron-phonon coupling\nwe finally recover the proper dc-limit. A slightly more\ninvolved calculation confirms the equivalence for finite\ndc-bias.\nConclusions.- We derived a formula for the linear acconductance, Eq. (3), which is applicable for arbitrary\ninteractions and for a finite applied dc-bias. The formula\nexpresses the ac-conductance in terms of a central object\n\u03a0, which can be calculated using Keldysh diagrammatic\nmethods. We illustrated the application of our formula\nby explicit calculations for the resonant level model and\nthe case of electron-phonon coupling.\nWe acknowledge funding by the DFG via SFB/TR 12,\nSFB 631, NIM, and the Emmy-Noether program and\nthank A.
