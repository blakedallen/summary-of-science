They all are considered to be\nnearby sources. Searching for similar objects with larger\ndistances, one expects larger interstellar absorption resulting in harder X-ray counterparts. Current interstellar absorption treatment depends on chosen abundances\nand scattering cross-sections of the elements as well as on\nthe 3D distribution of the interstellar medium. After a\ndiscussion of these factors we use the comprehensive 3D\nmeasurements of the Local Bubble by Lallement et al.\n(2003) to construct two simple models of the 3D distribution of the hydrogen column density. We test these\nmodels by using a set of soft X-ray sources with known\ndistances. Finally, we discuss possible applications for\ndistance estimations and population synthesis studies.\nKeywords neutron stars * absorption * ISM * Xray:general\n\nThought to be nearby, the M7 represent nearly half of\nthe local young neutron star population. Despite several searches for new candidates of this radio-quiet neutron star class (e.g. Ag\u00fceros et al. 2006; Chieregato et al.\n2005; Rutledge et al. 2003), no new M7-like object has\nbeen confirmed up to now. One aggravating circumstance\nthese searches face is the hardening of the X-ray spectrum due to the interstellar absorption. Caused mainly\nby photo-electric absorption of photons by heavy elements, the interstellar absorption is usually described\nby the equivalent hydrogen column density assuming certain chemical abundances. Highly important is the clumpiness of the interstellar medium (ISM) causing (un)favourable\nlines of sights to search for new M7-like objects. The\nknowledge about the local ISM structure is also important in connection with the long-debated issue of isolated\nneutron stars accreting from the ISM.\n\n1.1 Abundances and cross-sections\nMost absorption models today presume element abundances independent of the line of sight.

The galactic coordinate x varies from\n50 to 2500 pc (direction: from the Sun towards the galactic\ncenter), y is always 0, z is 25 pc north . For the ISM distribution, we applied the same as used by Popov et al. (2000),\nwhich is described in more detail below. The effect of less absorption, resulting from the use of the newer routine 'tbabs',\nis stronger at larger column densities, hence distances.\n\nB.

This is true for all extinction-related methods\nto our knowledge and results in much more coarse sampling compared to the Solar neighbourhood. The results\nobtained by the various methods can differ for the same\nregions and a combination can be difficult. These difficulties result partly from the different observed astrophysical phenomena like measuring the dust emission or\nstellar magnitudes. They also result from different sets of\nstellar absolute magnitude calibrations and the underlying assumptions which can deviate from each other as interstellar extinction determination is an iterative process\ncoupled with the identification of the statistical properties of stars (Hakkila et al. 1997).\n2 Two simple 3D distribution model cubes of\nthe absorbing ISM\nConsidering the absorption in the Solar neighbourhood,\nthe result by Lallement et al. (2003) is a good starting\npoint representing the currently best database of the local ISM distribution. R. Lallement kindly provided us\nwith the Nai density cube derived using the inversion\nmethod developed by Vergely et al. (2001). Due to the\nsmoothing length of 25 pc applied in this method by\nLallement et al. (2003), structures smaller than 25 pc\ncannot be resolved. We note further that even if measurements go up to Hipparcos distances of 350 pc from the\nSun, the sampling becomes coarser at larger distances.\nThus the sodium density cube has a span of only 250 pc\nand starting from 200 pc one has to be careful dealing\neventually with the a priori density information applied\nin the inversion method (R. Lallement, personal communication). From the Nai density cube we calculate the\ncolumn density for the same grid (sampling 3.9 pc). This\nis then converted to H i column density applying the formula by Ferlet et al. (1985).\nIt has to be mentioned that there are on-going discussions about how well the sodium D-line absorption ac-\n\n3\n\nFig. 4 The N(H) predicted by the extinction model\nbased on Hakkila et al. (1997) at 1 kpc\nPositive galactic latitudes are up and l = 0\u25e6 is in the center.\nThe N(H) scale is in unities of 1022 cm\u22122 . For description of\nthe model and discussion see text.\n\ntually traces H i . The correlation found between the H i\nand Na column densities derived from Na-D absorption\nlines by Ferlet et al. (1985) was doubted by Welty et al.\n(1994), especially for low column densities (log N(N aI) <\n11). The region of the Lallement cube that should not\nbe used because it has such low column densities is indicated in Fig. 2.\nHowever, the lowest known X-ray\u2013measured hydrogen column density for one of the M7 converts to a\nsodium column density of log N(Nai) > 11.5 (applying\nthe formula by Ferlet et al. 1985). Therefore this lowcolumn density uncertainty is not important considering the M7 and negligible for the intended population\nsynthesis with neutron stars (NSs) at usually larger distances.\nVergely et al. (2001) could not always find a correlation\nof the Nai density with the H i density. They concluded\nthat the correlation is rather weak due to non-constant\npopulation ratios for interstellar medium species, thus\ndifferent abundances. Lallement et al. (2003) noted the\nsize of the Local Bubble revealed by H i is smaller than\nwhen derived by Nai. This was explained by the first ionization stage of Nai being below that of H i , resulting\nin a longer neutral phase of H i (Lallement et al. 2003).\nRecently, Hunter et al. (2006) presented new ultraviolet\nNai observations towards 74 O- and B-type stars in the\ngalactic disk. Where possible they also derived column\ndensities of the Nai D-lines. Then they compared the\ncorrelation between the Nai and H i column densities.\nWhile there was an excellent agreement with Ferlet et al.\n(1985) for the D-lines, this was not the case for their ultraviolet absorption lines. Hunter et al. (2006) found a\nsignificant offset for the correlation they got from the\nNai D-lines compared to the relation derived from the\nUV transitions, even after accounting for saturation effects in the D-lines. They argue that this offset is due to\nan underestimation of approximately 30 % of N(H) in the\ncase of Nai D-lines observations. Recapitulating, one has\n\n\f4\n\nFig. 5 N(H) deviations at different distances\nShown are the differences between the model N(H) at the\ndistances of the open cluster sample and the N(H) obtained\ndirectly from the reddening measurements of this sample.

While the scatter at low distances is relatively\nsmall, the analytical model has a larger spread at larger distances.\n\nB.

The Local Bubble\nwas taken into account by Popov et al. (2000) as a sphere\nof 140 pc radius having a constant low density of 0.1 particles cm\u22123 . As noted above, there are other more recent\ntheoretical 3D extinction models. However, the analytical H density model by Popov et al. (2000) seems to be\nat least as good as e.g. the underlying model used by\nAm\u00f4res & L\u00e9pine (2005). The model of Drimmel et al.\n(2003) cannot be applied to distances less than a few\nhundred parsecs in the Solar neighbourhood and the data\nof Marshall et al. (2006) has a coarse sampling with distance bins of 1 kpc.\nBoth described models are applied only for distances\nlarger than 230 pc in case they provide an N(H) larger\nthan derived from the sodium cube at 230 pc. Otherwise\nthe hydrogen column density at 230 pc is taken since\nthe column density can only increase with distance. We\nuse spherical coordinates \u2013 the galactic cordinates l, b\nand distance d. The nominal sampling is one degree in\nl and b, and 10 pc for the distance. This is technically\nmotivated and does not represent the actually achieved\naccuracy.

(1985) as the best possibility at\nhand to take into account the local inhomogenity in the\nISM for X-ray astronomy with low spectral resolution.\nAt larger distances we consider two different models \u2013 one is based completely on extinction measurements and another one is described by analytical formulae. Hakkila et al. (1997) put several extinction studies carefully together in an easily accessible routine. All\nstudies have been modified to statistically account for\nunsampled regions. Additionally, a correction method for\nthe systematic underestimation between 1 and 5 kpc was\ndeveloped. Errors were provided individually for each\nconsidered main survey and for their mean.

We selected four of the rare NSs having at\nfound by Predehl & Schmitt (1995) for the source LMC the same time known parallaxes and hydrogen column\nX-1. Therefore, we consider only open clusters with dis- densities with small error bars obtained from X-ray observations. In Table 1 we present the model-derived distances larger than 230 pc.\nWe compared the hydrogen column densities we inferred tances for the measured N(H) range as well as the modelfrom the open cluster reddenings with those obtained by derived N(H) at the given parallactic distance. While\nthe analytical model gives reasonable results for PSR\nthe models. 628 out of the 650 open clusters by Piskunov et al.\n(2006) lie within the considered data cube with distances B0656+14, Vela and RX J1856.5-37541 (RXJ1856 in the\nlarger than 230 pc and smaller than 4.5 kpc.

Interestingly Walter et al. 2006\n(this volume) reported recently a revised distance of\n254+111\n\u221259 pc towards Geminga. In the case of RXJ1856 the\nderived minimal and maximal distances are completely\nincluded in the N(H) cube obtained by the Lallement et al.\n(2003) measurements. Here, an error of 25 pc applies\nwhile an error estimate is difficult for the analytical model\nat distances larger than 230 pc. The Hakkila et al. (1997)\nmodel has often a formal mean error of the same order\nas the obtained N(H) values.\nAs noted in above it is still debated how good Nai\nD-lines are as tracer for hydrogen. In particular it is unclear whether molecular hydrogen is well traced. In Table 1 we include the results obtained for two further test\nobjects situated in or close to molecular cloud cores \u2013\nthe star-forming site CrA close to RXJ1856 and MBM12\n(Magnani et al. 1985). While towards MBM12 there is\nan enlarged but still underestimated amount of hydrogen\n(see also Lallement et al. 2003 for discussion of MBM12),\nthe small CrA cloud is clearly missed. Both examples indicate that one has to be cautious in applying the N (H)\ncube obtained from the Lallement et al. (2003) measurements in the direction of small molecular clouds. However, there are only few such density enhancements of\nmolecular hydrogen in the close Solar neighbourhood.\nThe extinction model as well as the analytical model are\nin principle sensitive to molecular hydrogen. At large distances > 1 kpc the extinction model may miss molecular\nclouds due to their low angular size and bad sampling\nwhile the analytical model does not consider individual\nclouds.\n3 Applications of the models\n3.1 Distance estimates\nA possible application is to estimate the distance to neutron stars without parallaxes or other distance measurements. This is the case of the majority of the M7 where\ndespite for RXJ1856 only a preliminary parallactic distance of 330+170\n\u221280 pc is reported for RX J0720.4-3125 by\nvan Kerkwijk & Kaplan 2006 (this volume). We obtain\nN(H) by considering the best XSP EC-fits for blackbody and absorption lines of all currently available XMM\nEPIC-pn observations reduced with XMM SAS 6.5 for\neach neutron star. As noted by Haberl 2006 (this volume), in this respect the XMM EPIC-pn is the bestsuited instrument for relative measurements with reasonably small errors (\u2248 0.1 * 1020 cm\u22122 for all objects).\nThe model predictions for these column densities can be\nfound in Table 2. As noted before, the technical sampling is 10 pc. If a N(H) value lies between two sampling points we indicate this by noting e.g. 235. However, even errors in the best-studied regions (\u2264 230 pc)\nare around 25 pc , and can be much larger otherwise.\nIn case of the extinction model based on Hakkila et al.\n(1997) one cannot always derive a convincing value due\n\nB.

However, absorption lines in the spectrum\nalso influence N(H). Schwope 2006 (this volume) fitted\nthe spectrum of RBS 1223 using recent new observations\nand obtained N(H)= 3.7 * 1020 cm\u22122 for one absorption\nline. This value is comparable to our result in Table 2,\ntaking into account the additional data. However, the fit\nwas not very good and Schwope 2006 obtained better fits\nwith two absorption lines N(H), yielding values ranging\nfrom 1.2 * 1020 cm\u22122 to 1.8 * 1020 cm\u22122 . The lower value\nwould correspond to a distance of 525 pc when using the\nanalytical model.\nOverall, the distances derived from both models towards\ntwo neutron stars are in acceptable agreement:\nfor RX J0720.4-3125 with 250 pc and for RX J0806.44123 with 240 pc. Since both NSs are close to the border of the sodium measurements, an error of \u2248 25 pc\nseems reasonable. In general, the values of the analytical\nmodel have to be used with caution as local clumpiness\nof the ISM is not considered by this model at distances\n> 230 pc. Considering the open cluster test from above,\nthe mean N(H) deviation of the analytical model up to\n500 pc is 0.05 * 1020 cm\u22122 ; the standard deviation, however, is 4.9 * 1020 cm\u22122 .\n3.2 Population synthesis\nThe main motivation for us to take into account better absorption treatment is an improved population synthesis model based on that of Popov et al. (2000, 2003)\nand Popov et al. (2005c). A detailed discussion of the\nimprovements is beyond the scope of this article and\nwill be provided elsewhere (Popov, Posselt, in preparation). Therefore, we summarize here only the new developments and concentrate on illustrating the importance\nof the interstellar absorption.\n\n\fThe Magnificent Seven in the dusty prairie\n\nFig. 7 The logN \u2013logS curves for different models\nEach curve shows the expected number of observable neutron\nstars at ROSAT PSPC countrates. The solid line represents\nthe curve for the new progenitor distribution but old absorption model; the dotted and the dashed line are the results\nof the old simulations by e.g. Popov et al. (2003) for Gould\nBelt radii of RGB = 500 pc and RGB = 300 pc respectively.\nThe only difference to the solid curve is the progenitor distribution. The results of taking into account the new progenitor distribution and additionnally the new absorption models\nare shown by the dashed-dotted line for the refined analytical\nISM model and the dot-dot-dot-dashed line for the extinction\nmodel based on Hakkila et al. (1997). Furthermore the measurement points of young NSs with thermal X-ray emission\nare plotted as in Popov et al. (2003). For discussion see text.\n\nWhile Popov et al. (2003, 2005c) modeled the neutron\nstar progenitor distribution as coming from infinitely\nthin disks, either from the galactic plane or the Gould\nBelt, the new initial distribution is more realistic. Up\nto the Hipparcos limit of 400 pc (ESA 1997) the known\nB2-O8 stars are considered individually as well as their\naffiliation to an OB association (de Zeeuw et al. 1999)\nresulting in birth properties depending on the age of\nthe OB-association. The Gould Belt birth rate is applied\nhere. For distances above 400 pc, the galactic disk is considered for few neutron stars randomly as well as 36 associations (Blaha & Humphreys 1989; Mel'nik & Efremov\n1995) for most of the neutron stars. Due to the unknown ages of the associations, the birth probability\nis set proportional to the number of association members. In Fig. 7, the logN -logS curves are shown for the\nold thin-disk Gould Belt models with either 300 pc or\n500 pc radius, the new progenitor distribution as well\nas for the the new progenitor distribution considering\nboth absorption models. All simulations were done for\nthe same mass spectrum as in Popov et al. (2006), the\ncooling curve set labeled Model I in the same paper, the\nsame abundances and cross-sections (in this case those\nof Morrison & McCammon (1983) for comparison) and\nidentical remaining parameters. The results for the new\nprogenitor distribution lie in-between those of the two\nGould Belt sizes, a little apart from the measured inte-\n\n7\n\ngrated number of objects. This is also true for the curve\nconsidering the absorption by the analytical model. At\nthe bright end the differences introduced by the analytical absorption model are only very small. Towards\nlower countrates, the curve lies significantly below the\none without the refined 3D ISM model. Considering the\nabsorption based on the extinction model by Hakkila et al.\n(1997) gives another picture. At the bright end the curve\nis much lower than that without the refined 3D ISM\nmodel, while the difference becomes smaller towards low\ncountrates. We note here again that both absorption\nmodels are the same up to 230 pc, based on the measurements by Lallement et al. (2003). Both also consider the\nopen cluster data, however slightly differently as the column density is only allowed to increase. The curve of the\nanalytical model shows best the influence of an improved\nISM distribution model compared to the old absorption\ntreatment (e.g. Popov et al. 2003) where the analytical\nmodel without the data by Lallement et al. (2003) and\nPiskunov et al. (2006) was used). One might have expected that differences should be largest at low distances\nand hence for bright sources. However, averaging over\nthe small Local Bubble gives apparently the same result\nas the simpler description before. The influence of the\nbetter model for the Solar vicinity is apparent in the expected location likelihoods for neutron stars. Going to\nlarger distances the additive column densities are especially large around l \u2248 300\u25e6 to l \u2248 60\u25e6 in the galactic\nplane where many objects could be expected. Thus, the\nnumber of predicted neutron stars is reduced. The N(H)\nmodel based on the extinction study by Hakkila et al.\n(1997) shows on average much higher N(H) already at\n240 pc compared to the analytical model. Given the\nnearly rectangular shape of the regions with relatively\nhigh values in the l, b plane these seem to be caused at\nleast partly by bad sampling and the necessary statistical treatment. The higher N(H) results in less observable sources bringing the corresponding logN -logS much\ncloser to the actually measured number of sources at the\nbright end.\nWe made similar test plots for the expected neutron star\nnumber per square degree like the one presented in Fig. 6\nby Popov et al. (2005c). We summarize here only the\nmain results, for detailed discussion see Popov, Posselt\n2006 (in prep.). Contrary to the old model the predicted\nneutron star number is enhanced in regions including the\nnearby Gould Belt OB associations (e.g. Upp Sco) with\nthe new progenitor distribution. Sources are not anymore homogeneously distributed at all longitudes along\nthe planes of the galactic disk or the Gould Belt. When\nit comes to consider the 3D ISM models, the influence\nof the absorption is on much smaller scales. Less sources\nwould be expected at higher latitudes, and towards some\nsmall regions the high extinction hinders the possible\ndetection of neutron stars. Differences between the two\nabsorption models are pronounced only in small regions\nwhich to discuss in detail is beyond our intention here.\n\n\f8\n\n4 Conclusions\nAn understanding of the interstellar absorption is crucial for the interpretation of low-resolution soft X-ray\nspectra. Taking into account the 3D distribution of the\nISM is important to determine the absorption of known\nsources as well as for searches of new soft X-ray sources\ntowards a particular direction in the sky. We presented\ntwo simple models for 3D ISM distributions together\nwith possible applications: distance estimation and the\npopulation synthesis for young isolated thermal, thus soft\nX-rays emitting neutron stars. Both models are large\nscale models and have to be used with caution especially\nconsidering distance estimations. Concerning population\nsynthesis the two models influence the logN \u2013logS curve\ndiscriminatively, while the differences for the predicted\nspatial distribution of observable neutron stars are only\nsmall.\nAcknowledgements We would like to thank R.
