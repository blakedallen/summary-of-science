The number of cubic partitions, denoted\nby a(n), originated from the work of Chan [6] in connection with Ramanujan's cubic continued\nfraction which is often denoted by\nG(q) :=\n\nq 1/3 q + q 2 q 2 + q 4 q 3 + q 6\n,\n1 + 1 + 1 + 1 +***\n\n|q| < 1.\n\nOn page 366 of his Lost Notebook, Ramanujan claimed that there are many properties of\nG(q) which are analogous to Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction R(q) [21]\nR(q) :=\n\nq 1/5 q q 2 q 3\n,\n1 + 1 + 1 + 1 +***\n\n|q| < 1.\n\nMotivated by Ramanujan's observation, many new results on G(q) analogous to those\nfor R(q) have been found, see, e.g., Chan [9]. To give an overview of recent results on a(n),\nit is informative to recall relevant background on the generating function of p(n) and the\nRogers-Ramanujan continued fraction R(q).\n\n1\n\n\fRamanujan obtained many theorems on R(q), see Andrews and Berndt [1]. In particular,\nhe discovered the following beautiful identities on R(q) and 1/R(q).\n1\n\u2212 1 \u2212 R(q) =\nR(q)\n1\n\u2212 11 \u2212 R5 (q) =\n5\nR (q)\nHere (q; q)\u221e is the usual notation for\n\n\u221e\nQ\n\n(q 1/5 ; q 1/5 )\u221e\nq 1/5 (q 5 ; q 5 )\u221e\n\n(1.1)\n\n(q; q)6\u221e\n.\nq(q 5 ; q 5 )6\u221e\n\n(1.2)\n\n(1 \u2212 q n ).\n\nn=1\n\nBerndt [5, p.165] gave a beautiful proof of the following classical identity of Ramanujan\nby using the continued fraction R(q):\n\u221e\n(q; q)6\u221e X\np(5n + 4)q n = 5.\n(q 5 ; q 5 )5\u221e\n\n(1.3)\n\nn=0\n\nDividing (1.2) by (1.1), we get\n(q; q)6\u221e\nq 4/5 (q 1/5 ; q 1/5 )\u221e (q 5 ; q 5 )5\u221e\n= R4 (q) \u2212 R3 (q) + 2R2 (q) \u2212 3R(q) + 5 +\n\n3\nR(q)\n\n+\n\n2\nR2 (q)\n\n+\n\n1\nR3 (q)\n\n+\n\n1\n.\nR4 (q)\n\n(1.4)\n\nNow, (1.3) can be easily deduced from (1.4) by extracting the integer powers of q n , n \u2265 0 from\nboth sides of above identity since R(q) has only terms in the form of q n+1/5 . Ramanujan's\ncongruence on p(n) modulo 5 can be derived directly from (1.3)\np(5n + 4) \u2261 0 (mod 5).\n\n(1.5)\n\nRecently, using two identities of Ramanujan [21] on G(q), see also Berndt [4, p.345, Entry\n1], Chan [6] has found the following identities on G(q) and 1/G(q) analogous to the above\nidentities (1.1) and (1.2):\n1\n\u2212 1 \u2212 2G(q) =\nG(q)\n1\n\u2212 7 \u2212 8G3 (q) =\nG3 (q)\n\n(q 1/3 ; q 1/3 )\u221e (q 2/3 ; q 2/3 )\u221e\n,\nq 1/3 (q 3 ; q 3 )\u221e (q 6 ; q 6 )\u221e\n\n(1.6)\n\n(q; q)4\u221e (q 2 ; q 2 )4\u221e\n.\nq(q 3 ; q 3 )4\u221e (q 6 ; q 6 )4\u221e\n\n(1.7)\n\nMotivated by the idea of Berndt, Chan derived the following identity by dividing both\nsides of (1.7) by (1.6) and then setting q \u2192 q 3 :\n\u0013\n18 18 3 \u0012\n9 9 3\n1\n1\n1\n2 (q ; q )\u221e (q ; q )\u221e\n2 3\n3\n=q\n4G (q ) \u2212 2G(q ) + 3 +\n+\n.(1.8)\n(q; q)\u221e (q 2 ; q 2 )\u221e\n(q 3 ; q 3 )4\u221e (q 6 ; q 6 )4\u221e\nG(q 3 ) G2 (q 3 )\nObserving that the powers of q in G(q 3 ) are in the form of 3n + 1, we find\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u221e\nX\n\u0002 3n \u0003\n1\n1\n2 3\n3\n+\nq 3n = 3.\nq\n4G (q ) \u2212 2G(q ) + 3 +\nG(q 3 ) G2 (q 3 )\nn=0\n\n2\n\n\fIt is now natural to define a function a(n) by the left hand side of (1.8)\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=0\n\na(n)q n =\n\n1\n,\n(q; q)\u221e (q 2 ; q 2 )\u221e\n\n(1.9)\n\nand it is natural to expect a(n) to have analogous properties to p(n).\nExtracting those terms whose powers of q are in the form of 3n + 2 on both sides of (1.8),\nand then simplifying and setting q 3 \u2192 q, Chan established the following elegant identity\nanalogous to (1.3)\n\u221e\nX\n(q 3 ; q 3 )3\u221e (q 6 ; q 6 )3\u221e\na(3n + 2)q n = 3\n.\n(1.10)\n(q; q)4\u221e (q 2 ; q 2 )4\u221e\nn=0\n\nThe above identity immediately leads to the following congruence\na(3n + 2) \u2261 0 (mod 3),\n\n(1.11)\n\nwhich is analogous to Ramanujan's congruence (1.5) for p(n).\nFrom the point of view of partitions, it is obvious from the generating function (1.9) that\na(n) is the number of partition pairs (\u03bb, \u03bc) where |\u03bb| + |\u03bc| = n and \u03bc only has even parts.\nChan has called a(n) a certain partition function. Kim [11] called such partitions counted\nby a(n) cubic partitions owing to the fact that a(n) is close related to Ramanujan's cubic\ncontinued fraction.\nBased on the cubic partition interpretation of a(n), Chan [8] asked whether there exist\na function analogous to Dyson's rank that leads to a combinatorial interpretation of the\ncongruence (1.5). Kim [11] discovered a crank function NVa (m, n) for cubic partitions. Let\nM \u2032 (m, N, n) be the number of cubic partitions of n with crank \u2261 m (mod N ), Kim proved\nthat\nM \u2032 (0, 3, 3n + 2) \u2261 M \u2032 (1, 3, 3n + 2) \u2261 M \u2032 (2, 3, 3n + 2) (mod 3),\nwhich implies (1.11).\nOur main results are concerned with congruences for a(n) modulo 5 and 7 which are in\nthe spirit of Ramanujan's classical congruences modulo 7 and 11. Recall that Ramanujan\nobtained more general congruences modulo 5k :\np(5k n + rk ) \u2261 0 (mod 5k ),\n\n(1.12)\n\nwhere k \u2265 1 and 5k rk \u2261 1 (mod 24). In analogy with Ramanujan's congruences, Chan\nconsidered the general congruences for a(n) modulo powers of 3. Employing the method of\nHirschhorn and Hunt [10] to prove (1.12), Chan [7] derived the following congruence as a\nconsequence of (1.10).\nTheorem 1.1. For k \u2265 1,\na(3k n + ck ) \u2261 0 (mod 3k+\u03b4(k) ),\n\n(1.13)\n\nwhere ck is the reciprocal modulo 3k of 8, and \u03b4(k) = 1 if k is even and \u03b4(k) = 0 otherwise.\n\n3\n\n\fIn the general case, Ramanujan conjectured that there are only three choices for a prime\nl such that the congruence p(ln + c) \u2261 0 (mod l) holds, namely, l = 5, 7, 11. This conjecture\nhas been confirmed by Ahlgren and Boylan [3] based on the work of Kiming and Olsson [12].\nChan [7] raised the problem of finding simple congruences for a(n) besides a(3n + 2) \u2261 0\nmod 3. Recently, Sinick [22] has shown that there does not exist other primes l such that\na(ln + c) \u2261 0 (mod l) except that l = 3. In analogy with the results for p(n) due to Ono [17]\nand Ahlgren [2], Chan [8] obtained the following theorem concerning congruences for a(n)\nmodulo powers of a prime.\nTheorem 1.2. Let m \u2265 5 be prime and j a positive integer. Then a positive proportion of\nthe primes Q \u2261 \u22121 (mod 128mj ) have the property that\n\u0013\n\u0012\nmQn + 1\n\u2261 0 (mod mj ),\na\n8\nfor every n coprime to Q.\nThe above theorem implies that for every integer n there exists infinitely many non-nested\narithmetic progressions An + B for prime m \u2265 5 and positive integer j such that\na(An + B) \u2261 0 (mod mj ).\nIt should be noted that although the proof of Theorem 1.2 leads to some Ramanujantype congruences modulo mj , it does not cover all the congruences in form of a(An + B) \u2261\n0 (mod mj ). Chan [7] studied the case for m = 3, which is not in the scope of Theorem\n1.2. This paper is devoted to finding concrete congruences for the cases m = 5, 7 and j = 1,\nwhich are also out of the range of Theorem 1.2 since the Q is larger than 1278 and 2686 for\nm = 5 and 7, respectively. To be precise, we derive the following congruences by constructing\nsuitable modular forms.\nTheorem 1.3. For every nonnegative integer n, we have\na(25n + 22) \u2261 0 (mod 5).\nIt would be interesting to give a combinatorial interpretation of the above congruence by\nfinding a suitable crank function. In the following theorem, we present some congruences\nmodulo 7.\nTheorem 1.4. For every nonnegative integer n, we have\na(49n + 15) \u2261 a(49n + 29) \u2261 a(49n + 36) \u2261 a(49n + 43) \u2261 0 (mod 7).\nThe last section of this paper is focused on the parity of a(n). Recall that Kolberg [13] has\nshown that p(n) takes both even and odd values infinitely often. From numerical evidence, we\nconjecture that when n tends to infinity the parities of a(1), a(2), . . . , a(n) are equidistributed.\nWhile we have not been able to prove this conjecture, we shall show that there are infinitely\nmany even values of a(n) and there are infinitely many odd values of a(n).\n\n4\n\n\f2\n\nPreliminaries\n\nTo make this paper self-contained, we give an overview of the background relevant to the\nproofs of the congruences for a(n) by using modular forms. For more details on the theory\nof modular forms, see for example, Koblitz [14] and Ono [18].\nFor a rational integer N \u2265 1, the congruence subgroup \u03930 (N ) of SL2 (Z) is defined by\n\u001b\n\u0013\n\u001a\u0012\na b\nc \u2261 0 (mod N ) .\n\u03930 (N ) :=\nc d\nLet \u03b3 =\n\n\u0012\n\na b\nc d\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2208 SL2 (Z) act on the complex upper half plane\nH := {z \u2208 C|Im(z) > 0}\n\nby the linear fractional transformation\n\u03b3z :=\n\naz + b\n.\ncz + d\n\nSuppose that k is a positive integer and \u03c7 is a Dirichlet character modulo N .\nDefinition 2.1. Let f (z) be a holomorphic function on H and satisfy the following relation\nfor all \u03b3 \u2208 \u03930 (N ) and all z \u2208 H,\nf (\u03b3z) = \u03c7(d)(cz + d)k f (z).\nIn addition, if f (z) is also holomorphic at the cusps of \u03930 (N ), we call such a function f (z)\na modular form of weight k on \u03930 (N ).\nThe modular forms of weight k on \u03930 (N ) with Dirichlet character \u03c7 form a finitedimensional complex vector space denoted by Mk (\u03930 (N ), \u03c7). For convenience, we write\nMk (\u03930 (N )) for Mk (\u03930 (N ), \u03c7) when \u03c7 is the trivial Dirichlet character.\nDedekind's eta function is defined by\n\u03b7(z) := q\n\n1\n24\n\n\u221e\nY\n\n(1 \u2212 q n ),\n\nn=1\n\nwhere q = e2\u03c0iz and Im(z) > 0. It is well-known that \u03b7(z) is holomorphic and does not vanish\non H.\nA function f (z) is called eta-quotient if it can be written in the form of\nY\nf (z) =\n\u03b7 r\u03b4 (\u03b4z),\n\u03b4|N\n\nwhere N \u2265 1 and each r\u03b4 is an integer. The following two facts is useful to verify whether an\neta-quotient is a modular form, see Ono [18, p.18].\n5\n\n\fProposition 2.1. If f (z) =\n\nQ\n\n\u03b4|N\n\n\u03b7 r\u03b4 (\u03b4z) is an eta-quotient with\nk=\n\n1X\nr\u03b4 \u2208 Z,\n2\n\u03b4|N\n\nsatisfies the following conditions:\nX\n\u03b4|N\n\nand\n\n\u03b4r\u03b4 \u2261 0 (mod 24)\n\nXN\n\u03b4|N\n\n\u03b4\n\n(2.1)\n\nr\u03b4 \u2261 0 (mod 24),\n\n(2.2)\n\nthen f (z) satisfies\nf\nfor each\n\n\u0012\n\na b\nc d\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\naz + b\ncz + d\n\n\u0013\n\n= \u03c7(d)(cz + d)k f (z)\n\n\u2208 \u03930 (N ). Here the character \u03c7 is defined by \u03c7(d) :=\ns :=\n\nY\n\n\u03b4 r\u03b4\n\n(2.3)\n\u0010\n\n(\u22121)k s\nd\n\n\u0011\n, where\n\n\u03b4|N\n\nand\n\n\u0001\nm\nn\n\nis Kronecker symbol.\n\nBased on this proposition, for a given eta-quotient f (z), by checking the conditions (2.1)\nand (2.2), one can show that f (z) satisfies (2.3). Moreover, if k is a positive integer and f (z)\nis holomorphic at the cusps of \u03930 (N ), then f (z) \u2208 Mk (\u03930 (N ), \u03c7) because \u03b7(z) is holomorphic\nand does not vanish on H. Combined with the following proposition which gives the analytic\norders of an eta-quotient at the cusps of \u03930 (N ), we can deduce that f (z) is a modular form.\nProposition 2.2. Let c, d and N be positive integers with d|N and (c, d) = 1. If f (z) is an\neta-quotient satisfying the conditions in Proposition 2.1 for N , then the order of vanishing of\nf (z) at the cusp dc is\nN X (d, \u03b4)2 r\u03b4\n.\nN\n24\n(d,\n)d\u03b4\nd\n\u03b4|N\nIn the other words, to prove that the above function f (z) is holomorphic at the cusp dc ,\nit suffices to check that\nX (d, \u03b4)2 r\u03b4\n\u2265 0.\n\u03b4\n\u03b4|N\n\nLet M be a positive integer and\nf (z) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\na(n)q n\n\nn=0\n\nbe a function with rational integer coefficients. Define ordM (f (z)) to be the smallest n such\nthat a(n) 6\u2261 0 (mod M ). Sturm [23] provided the following powerful criterion to determine\nwhether two modular forms are congruent modulo a prime by the verification of a finite\nnumber of cases.\n6\n\n\fProposition 2.3.

To establish the claimed congruence relation, we shall construct an eta-quotient with\nthe following expansion in q = e2\u03c0iz ,\nX\ng(z) =\nb(n)q n .\nn\u22650\n\nWe assume that g(z) satisfies the following conditions\n(1) g(z) is a modular form;\n(2) If for all n \u2265 0, b(25n + 25) \u2261 0 (mod 5) then a(25n + 22) \u2261 0 (mod 5);\n(3) The function\ng(z)|U (25) =\n\nX\n\nn\u22650\n\nis also a modular form.\n8\n\nb(25n)q n \u2261 0 (mod 5)\n\n\fIn order to satisfy the second condition, we consider the function h(q) of the following\nform\nY \u0010 (q; q)5 \u0011tj\nY\n\u221e\n,\nh(q) =\n(q 25ri ; q 25ri )s\u221ei\n(q 5 ; q 5 )\u221e\nj\n\ni\n\nwhere ri , si , tj are integers. By the above Lemma 3.1, it is easily seen that for any integers\nri , si and tj the expansion of h(q) has the following form modulo 5,\nX\nh(q) \u2261 1 +\nc(m)q 25m (mod 5),\nm\u22651\n\nwhere c(m) are integers. Now, we set\ng(z) = h(q)\n\n\u221e\nX\n\na(n)q n+3 = h(q)\n\nn=0\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn\u22653\n\na(n \u2212 3)q n .\n\n(3.2)\n\nSince h(q) is a series in q 25 modulo 5 with constant term 1, we can make use of Proposition 2.4\n(2) to deduce that if for any n, b(25n+25) \u2261 0 (mod 5), then we have a(25n+22) \u2261 0 (mod 5).\nWe now proceed to determine the parameters ri , si and tj in g(z) to make it a modular\nform. Consider the case r1 = 1, s1 = 1, r2 = 2, s2 = 1 and t1 = 2, namely,\ng(z) = (q 25 ; q 25 )\u221e (q 50 ; q 50 )\u221e\n\n\u221e\n\u0010 (q; q)5 \u00112 X\n\u221e\na(n)q n+3 .\n(q 5 ; q 5 )\u221e n=0\n\n(3.3)\n\nWe are going to show that g(z) satisfies the conditions (2.1) and (2.2) in Proposition 2.1.\nRecalling the definition of \u03b7(z), we can rewrite g(z) as an eta-quotient\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u03b7(25z)\u03b7(50z) \u03b7 5 (z)\ng(z) =\n\u03b7(z)\u03b7(2z)\n\u03b7(5z)\n=\n\n\u03b7 9 (z)\u03b7(25z)\u03b7(50z)\n.\n\u03b7(2z)\u03b7 2 (5z)\n\nThe two conditions (2.1) and (2.2) can be expressed as follows,\nX\n\u03b4r\u03b4 = 9 \u2212 2 \u2212 5 \u00d7 2 + 25 + 50 \u2261 0 (mod 24),\n\u03b4|50\n\nX 50\n\u03b4|50\n\n\u03b4\n\nr\u03b4 = 50 \u00d7 9 \u2212 25 \u2212 10 \u00d7 2 + 2 + 1 \u2261 0 (mod 24).\n\nTo make g(z) a modular form, it remains to compute the order of g(z) at cusps. By Proposition 2.2, it is easily verified that the order of g(z) at the cusps of \u03930 (50) are nonnegative,\nthat is, for any d|50,\nX (d, \u03b4)2 r\u03b4\n\u2265 0.\n\u03b4\n\u03b4|50\n\nSo we have g(z) \u2208 M4 (\u03930 (50), \u03c71 ), where\n\u0012 \u0013 \u0012 \u00132\n5\n25\n=1\n=\n\u03c71 (d) =\nd\nd\n9\n\n\ffor (d, 50) = 1. This implies that g(z) \u2208 M4 (\u03930 (50)).\nSince we have proved that g(z) satisfies the second condition, the following congruence is\nvalid\na(25n + 22) \u2261 0 (mod 5)\n(3.4)\nprovided that for all n \u2265 0,\n\nb(25n + 25) \u2261 0 (mod 5).\n\n(3.5)\n\nX\n\n(3.6)\n\nLet us rewrite (3.5) as\nn\u22651\n\nb(25n)q n \u2261 0 (mod 5).\n\nBy Proposition 2.5, we see that the summation on the left hand side of (3.6) is a modular\nform, that is,\nX\ng(z)|U (25) =\nb(25n)q n \u2208 M4 (\u03930 (50)).\nn\u22651\n\nHence, by Proposition 2.3, we find that (3.6) is valid if (3.5) holds for\n0\u2264n\u2264\n\n1\n1\n4 \u00d7 50\n(1 + )(1 + ) + 1 = 31.\n12\n2\n5\n\nApplying Lemma 3.1 with p = 5 to (3.3), we have\nX\n\nn\u22653\n\nn\n\n25\n\n25\n\n50\n\n50\n\nb(n)q \u2261 (q ; q )\u221e (q ; q )\u221e\n\n\u221e\nX\n\na(n)q n+3 (mod 5).\n\n(3.7)\n\nn=0\n\nUsing the above relation and Proposition 2.4 (1), we see that the verification of (3.5) on\nb(n) for 0 \u2264 n \u2264 31 can be reduced to the verification of (3.4) on a(n) for a the same range\n0 \u2264 n \u2264 31. It is readily checked that (3.4) holds for 0 \u2264 n \u2264 31. This completes the proof.\nNow, we turn to the proof of Theorem 1.4, namely,\na(49n + 15) \u2261 a(49n + 29) \u2261 a(49n + 36) \u2261 a(49n + 43) \u2261 0 (mod 7).\n\n(3.8)\n\nProof of Theorem 1.4. Following the above procedure in the proof of Theorem 1.3, by the\ngenerating function of a(n), we construct an eta-quotient\nh(z) =\n\n\u03b7(49z)\u03b7(98z)\n\u03b7(z)\u03b7(2z)\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b7 7 (z)\n\u03b7(7z)\n\n\u00132\n\n\u03b7 13 (z)\u03b7(49z)\u03b7(98z)\n\u03b7(2z)\u03b7 2 (7z)\n\u00132\n\u0012\n\u221e\nX\n(q; q)7\u221e\n49 49\n98 98\n(q\n;\nq\n)\n(q\n;\nq\n)\na(n)q n+6 .\n=\n\u221e\n\u221e\n(q 7 ; q 7 )\u221e\nn=0\n\n=\n\n10\n\n(3.9)\n\n\fSetting N = 98, we see that h(z) satisfies the conditions (2.1) and (2.2) in Proposition\n2.1, namely,\nX\n\u03b4r\u03b4 = 13 \u2212 2 \u2212 2 \u00d7 7 + 49 + 98 \u2261 0 (mod 24),\n\u03b4|98\n\nX 98\n\u03b4|98\n\n\u03b4\n\nr\u03b4 = 98 \u00d7 13 \u2212 49 \u2212 14 \u00d7 2 + 2 + 1 \u2261 0 (mod 24).\n\nMoreover, it is not difficult to verify that the order of h(z) at the cusps of \u03930 (98) are nonnegative by Proposition 2.2, that is, for any d|98,\nX (d, \u03b4)2 r\u03b4\n\u03b4\n\n\u03b4|98\n\n\u2265 0.\n\nHence we deduce that h(z) is a modular form, i.e., h(z) \u2208 M6 (\u03930 (98), \u03c72 ).

In other words, w(z) \u2208 M6 (\u03930 (4802)).\nSince u(z) is also a modular form, we obtain\nv(z) = u(z) \u2212 w(z) \u2208 M6 (\u03930 (4802).\nBy Proposition 2.3, we find that v(z) \u2261 0 (mod 7) can be verified by a finite number of cases.\nTo be precise, we need to check that\ne(n) \u2261 0 (mod 7)\nholds for 0 \u2264 n \u2264 4117. In view of (3.14), we only need to verify that (3.12) holds for\n0 \u2264 n \u2264 \u2308 4117\u22121\n\u2309 \u2212 1 = 587. Since d(n) = c(7n), it suffices to check (3.11) for 0 \u2264 n \u2264 587.\n7\nFinally, using (3.10) and Proposition 2.4 (1), it is necessary to verify Theorem 1.4 holds only\nfor 0 \u2264 n \u2264 587, which is an easy task. This completes the proof.\n\n4\n\nThe Parity of a(n)\n\nIn this section, we show that the function a(n) takes infinitely many even values and infinitely\nmany odd values. For the partition function p(n), it has been conjectured by Parkin and\nShanks [19] that the parities of p(1), p(2), . . . , p(N ) are equidistributed when N tends to\ninfinity. Using the Euler's recurrence formula for p(n),\nX\np(n) +\n(\u22121)j p(n \u2212 \u03c9(j)) = 0,\n(4.1)\n0<\u03c9j \u2264n\n\nwhere \u03c9(j) = j(3j \u2212 1)/2, \u2212\u221e < j < \u221e, Kolberg [13] proved that p(n) takes both even and\nodd values infinitely often.\nTo prove the analogous property for a(n), we need Jacobi's identity\n\u221e\nX\n\n(\u22121)n (2n + 1)q n(n+1) = (q 2 ; q 2 )3\u221e\n\n(4.2)\n\nn=0\n\nand Gauss's identity\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nq n(n+1)/2 =\n\nn=0\n\n(q 2 ; q 2 )2\u221e\n.\n(q; q)\u221e\n\nWe now have the following recurrence relation modulo 2.\n12\n\n(4.3)\n\n\fTheorem 4.1.\na(n) +\n\nX\n\n0<k+k 2 \u2264n\n\na(n \u2212 k \u2212 k2 ) \u2261 \u2206(n) (mod 2),\n\n(4.4)\n\nwhere \u2206(n) = 1, if n = s(s + 1)/2 for some integer s and \u2206(n) = 0, otherwise.\nProof. Multiplying both sides of (1.9) by (q 2 ; q 2 )3\u221e , we get\n(q 2 ; q 2 )3\u221e\n\n\u221e\nX\n\na(n)q n =\n\nn=0\n\n(q 2 ; q 2 )2\u221e\n.\n(q; q)\u221e\n\n(4.5)\n\nSubstituting (4.2) and (4.3) into both sides of (4.5), we find that\n\u221e\nX\n\nq n(n+1)/2 =\n\n(\u22121)n (2n + 1)q n(n+1)\n\n\u2261\nqn\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u221e\nX\n\na(n)q n\n\nn=0\n\nn=0\n\nn=0\n\nEquating coefficients of\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nq n(n+1)\n\n\u221e\nX\n\na(n)q n\n\n(mod 2).\n\n(4.6)\n\nn=0\n\nn=0\n\non both sides of (4.6) gives (4.4). This completes the proof.\n\nWith the aid of the formula (4.4) and following the idea of Kolberg [13] for p(n), we\nobtain the following theorem for a(n).\nTheorem 4.2. There are infinitely many integers n such that a(n) is even and there are\ninfinitely many integers n such that a(n) is odd.\nProof. We prove by contradiction. Assume that there exists m such that a(n) is odd for any\nn \u2265 m. Without loss of generality, we may assume that m is an even integer greater than 2.\nIt is easy to show that there exists an integer m2 + 2m \u2264 t \u2264 m2 + 3m + 1 such that \u2206(t) = 0.\nSetting t = m2 + 2m + \u03b4, where 0 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 m + 1. Substituting n = t into (4.4) yields\na(m2 + 2m + \u03b4) + a(m2 + 2m + \u03b4 \u2212 2) + * * * + a(m + \u03b4) \u2261 0 (mod 2).\n\n(4.7)\n\nBut the left hand side of (4.7) is the sum of m + 1 odd numbers, so it is also odd since m is\neven. This leads to a contradiction with parity of the right hand side of (4.7).\nOn the other hand, assume that a(n) is even for any n \u2265 m, where m \u2265 5. It is easy to\nverify the following inequalities for k \u2265 10,\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u0001\n\u0001\n2k 2k \u2212 1\n2k 2k + 1\n<\n< k(k + 1).\nk(k \u2212 1) <\n2\n2\n\u221a\nTherefore, for k \u2265 10, there are no integers e(e + 1) in the following interval with \u2308 2k\u2309\nelements,\n\" \u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u0001 \u221a\n\u0001#\n\u2308 2k\u2309 \u2308 2k\u2309 \u2212 1 \u2308 2k\u2309 \u2308 2k\u2309 + 1\n.\n,\n2\n2\n\u221a\nChoose k such that d = \u2308 2k\u2309 > m and set\nt=\n\nd(d + 1)\n.\n2\n13\n\n\fLet r be the largest integer k such that k2 + k \u2264 t. It follows that\nt \u2212 r \u2212 r 2 > d > m.\nSubstituting n = t into (4.4), we obtain that\na(t) + a(t \u2212 2) + * * * + a(t \u2212 r \u2212 r 2 ) \u2261 \u2206(t) \u2261 1 (mod 2).\nThis is impossible since the left hand side of above congruence are a sum of even numbers.\nThis completes the proof.\nAcknowledgments.
