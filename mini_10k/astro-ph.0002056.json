Recent detailed simulations of Galactic Chemical Evolution\nhave shown that the heavy elements, in particular [Fe/H], are expected to\nexhibit a weak, or absent, correlation with stellar ages in the early Galaxy\ndue to the lack of efficient mixing of interstellar material enriched by\nindividual Type II supernovae. A promising alternative \"chronometer\" of\nstellar ages is suggested, based on the expectation that the light elements\nBe and B are formed primarily as spallation products of Galactic Cosmic\nRays.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt has become clear, from a number of lines of recent evidence, that the early\nevolution of the Galaxy is best thought of as a stochastic process. Within the first\n0.5-1 Gyr following the start of the star formation process, chemical enrichment\ndoes not operate within a well-mixed uniform environment, as was assumed in\nthe simple one-zone models that were commonly used in past treatments of this\nproblem. Rather, the very first generations of stars are expected to have their\nabundances of heavy elements set by local conditions, which are likely to have\nbeen dominated by the yields from individual SNeII.\nThe seeds of this paradigm shift can be found in the observations, interpretations, and speculations of McWilliam et al. (1995), Audouze & Silk (1995), and\nRyan, Norris, & Beers (1996). Models which attempt to incorporate these ideas\ninto a predictive formalism have been put forward by Tsujimoto, Shigeyama, &\nYoshii (1999; hereafter TSY), and Argast et al. (2000). Although they differ\nin the details of their implementation, and in a number of their assumptions,\nboth of these models rely on the idea of enhanced star formation in the high1\n\n\f2\n\nBeers, Suzuki, & Yoshii\n\ndensity shells of SN remnants, and the interaction of these shells of enriched\nmaterial with a local ISM. The predictions which result are similar as well: (1)\nBoth models are capable of reproducing the observed distributions of abundance\n(e.g., [Fe/H]) for stars in the tail of the halo metallicity distribution function\n(Laird et al. 1988; Ryan & Norris 1991; Beers 1999), and (2) Both models\npredict that the abundances of heavy elements, such as Fe, are not expected\nto show strong correlations with the ages of the first stars, at least up until an\nenrichment level on the order of [Fe/H]\u223c \u22122.0 is reached, i.e., at the time when\nmixing on a Galactic scale is possible (roughly 1 Gyr following the initiation of\nstar formation).\nSuzuki, Yoshii, & Kajino (1999; hereafter SYK, see also Suzuki, Yoshii, &\nKajino, this volume) have extended the SN-induced chemical evolution model\nof TSY to include predictions of the evolution of the light element species 9 Be,\n10 B, and 11 B, based on secondary processes involving spallative reactions with\nGalactic Cosmic Rays (hereafter GCRs). Recently, Suzuki, Yoshii, & Beers\n(2000) have considered the extension of this model to the prediction of 6 Li and\n7 Li, and demonstrate that they naturally reproduce the recently detected slope\nin the abundance of Li in extremely metal-poor stars noted by Ryan, Norris, &\nBeers (1999; see also Ryan this volume). It is particularly encouraging that the\nsame stochastic star-formation models which reproduce the observed trends of\nsome (but not all) heavy elements, such as Eu, Fe, etc., also obtain predictions of\nthe light element abundance distributions that match the available observations\nquite well, with a minimum of parameter tweaking.\nIn this contribution we summarize one of the more interesting predictions of\nthe TSY/SYK class of models, that the abundances of the light elements Be and\nB (hereafter, BeB) might be useful as stellar chronometers in the early Galaxy (a\ntime when the heavy element \"age-metallicity\" relationships are not operating\ndue to the lack of global mixing). It appears possible that, with refinement of\nthe modeling, and adequate testing, observations of BeB for metal-poor stars\nmay provide a chronometer with \"time resolution\" on scales of tens of Myrs.\n2.\n\nThe Essence of the Model\n\nIn this section we would like to briefly explain our model of SN-induced star\nformation and chemical evolution. After formation of the very FIRST generation\nof (Pop. III) stars, with atmospheres containing gas of primordial abundance,\nthe most massive of these stars exhaust their core H, and explode as SNeII.\nFollowing the explosion a shock is formed, because the velocity of the ejected\nmaterial exceeds the local sound speed. Behind the shock the swept-up ambient\nmaterial in the ISM accumulates to form a high-density shell. This shell cools\nin the later stages of the lifetime of a given SN remnant (SNR) and is a suitable\nsite for the star formation process to occur. The SNR shells are expected to be\ndistributed randomly throughout the early and rapidly evolving halo, and the\nshells do not easily merge with one another because of the large available volume.\nAs a result, each SNR keeps its identity and the stars which form there reflect\nthe abundances of material generated by their \"parent\" SN. TSY present this\nmodel, and describe the input assumptions, in more quantitative detail. Figure\n1 provides a cartoon illustration of the processes which we discuss herein.\n\n\f3\n\nThe Light Elements as Chronometers\n\nGalactic\nHalo\n\nGCRs\n\nSNII\n\nAcceleration\nAccelerated\nGCRs\n\nStar\nFormation\n\nGCRs\n\nShock\n\nShell\n\nEjecta\n\nFigure 1.\nA simplified view of the early stages of chemical evolution\nin the Galactic halo. In the lower cutout we show star formation being\ntriggered in SNR shells. See text for more detail.\n\n\f4\n\nBeers, Suzuki, & Yoshii\n\nOne of the most important results of the TSY model is that stellar metallicity, especially [Fe/H], cannot be employed as an age indicator at these early\nepochs. Thus, to consider the expected elemental abundances of the metal-poor\nstars which form at a given time, a distribution of stellar abundances must be\nconstructed, rather than adopting a global average abundance under the assumption that the gas of the ISM is well mixed. SYK constructed such a model,\ncoupled with the model of SN-induced chemical evolution, which considers the\nevolution of the light elements.\nSYK proposed that GCRs arise from the mixture of elements of individual\nSN ejecta and their swept-up ISM, with the acceleration being due to the shock\nformed in the SNR. GCRs originating from SNeII propagate faster than the\nmaterial trapped in the clouds of gas making up the early halo. As a result,\nGCRs are expected to achieve uniformity throughout the halo faster than the\ngeneral ISM, with its patchy structure. It follows that the abundances of BeB,\nwhich are mainly produced by spallation processes of CNO elements involving\nGCRs, are expected to exhibit a much tighter correlation with time than those\nof heavy elements, synthesized through stellar evolution and SN explosions.\nWe note that alternative models for the origin of spallative nucleosynthesis\nproducts have been developed which rely on the existence of spatially correlated\nSNeII in superbubbles of the early ISM (see Parizot & Drury 1999, and this\nvolume). The superbubble model predicts a locally homogeneous production of\nboth heavy and light elements, and the variety of stellar abundances which are\nobserved are explained by the differing diffusion processes of metal-rich ([Fe/H]\n\u223c \u22121) shells swept-up by the bubble and mixed with a metal-poor ([Fe/H] \u223c \u22124)\nISM. Tests of the \"isolated\" SN models vs. the superbubble models are expected\nto be conducted in the near future.\n3.\n\nAbundance Predictions of the Model\n\nFigure 2 shows the predicted behavior of the abundance of [Fe/H], log(Be/H),\nand log(B/H), as a function of time, over the first 0.6 Gyrs of the evolution\nof the early Galaxy, according to the model of SYK. At any given time (note\nthat \"zero time\" is set by the onset of star formation, not the beginning of the\nUniverse) the range of observed BeB is substantially less than that of Fe, owing\nto the global nature of light element production. For example, at time 0.2 Gyrs,\nthe expected stellar [Fe/H] extends over a range of 50, while that of log (BeB/H)\nis on the order of 3\u20137.\nDuring early epochs Fe is produced only by SNeII, and most of the Fe\nobserved in stars formed in SNR shells originates from that contributed by the\nparent SN, because of uniformly low Fe abundance in the ISM at that time.\nThus, the expected [Fe/H] of stars born at that time will exhibit a rather large\nrange, reflecting differences in Fe yields associated with the different masses of\nthe progenitor stars. On the other hand, according to the SYK model, most of\nthe BeB is produced by spallation reactions of CNO nuclei involving globally\ntransported GCRs. The observed abundances of BeB in metal-poor stars which\nformed at this time should reflect the global nature of their production, and\nthe correlation between time and BeB abundance is expected to be much better\nthan that found for heavier species.\n\n\fThe Light Elements as Chronometers\n\n5\n\nFigure 2.\nPredicted distribution of abundance for three elements,\nrelative to H, for long-lived stars born at the indicated time following\nthe initiation of star formation. The distributions have been convolved\nwith Gaussians with \u03c3 = 0.15 dex to take into account expected observational errors. The two contours, from the inside to the outside,\ncorrespond to probability density 10\u22123 and 10\u22125 within the unit area\n\u2206t = 10(Myr) \u00d7 \u2206 log (element/H) = 0.1. The solid lines show the\npredicted ISM gas abundances of each element.\nIn Table 1, we use the predictions from SYK, and the stellar abundance\ndata from Boesgaard et al. (1999) for Be, to put forward \"bold\" estimates of\nstellar ages (since the onset of star formation). We note that these numbers are\nmeant to be indicative, not definitive, predictions, as further tests of the model\nand its underlying assumptions still remain to be carried out. We have ordered\nthe table according to estimated (Be) time since the onset of star formation in\nthe early Galaxy.\nIt is interesting to consider the implications of this strong age-abundance\nrelationship for individual stars which have been noted in the literature as having\n\"peculiar\" BeB (or 7 Li for that matter) abundances, at least as compared to\notherwise similar stars of the same [Fe/H], Teff , and log g. The set of \"twins\"\nG64-12 and G64-37 have been noted as one example of stars with very low\nmetallicity, and apparently similar Teff and log g, which never-the-less, exhibit\nrather different abundances of 7 Li. Could this difference be accounted for by a\ndifference in AGE of these stars ? Answering this question is of great importance,\nand hopefully will be resolved in the near future.\n4.\n\nCan we Test This Model ?\n\nYes, but it will take some hard work. Obviously, if there exists an independent\nmethod with which to verify the relative age determinations predicted by this\nmodel, that would be ideal.

It is imperative that the present-generation 8m telescopes (VLT, SUBARU, GEMINI, HET) obtain this data, so that this, and other related questions,\nmay be addressed with the best possible information.\nAnother feasible test would be to compare the abundances of BeB with\n[Fe/H], and other heavy elements, for a large sample of stars with [Fe/H] < \u22122.0.\nIf the superbubble model is the correct interpretation, with an implied locally\nhomogeneous production of the light elements, then one might expect to find\ncorrelations between the abundances of various heavy element species (including\nthose other than Fe and O) and BeB. Simultaneous observations of light and\nheavy elements for stars of extremely low abundance are planned with all the\nmajor 8m telescopes, so it should not be too long before a sufficiently large\nsample to carry out this test is obtained.\nOne can also seek, as we have, confirmatory evidence in the predicted behavior of 7 Li vs. [Fe/H] (Suzuki et al. 2000).\n5.\n\nOther Uses for This Model\n\nIf the model we have considered here can be shown to be correct, there are several\nnew avenues of investigation which are immediately opened. For example, if one\nwere able to \"age rank\" stars on the basis of their BeB abundances, one could\nrefine alternative production mechanisms for the light element Li which are not\ndriven by GCR spallation, including the SN \u03bd\u2212process and/or production via a\ngiant-branch Cameron-Fowler mechanism (see Castilho et al. , this volume), in\nstellar flares, etc..\n\n\fThe Light Elements as Chronometers\n\n7\n\nFurthermore, since BeB nuclei are more difficult to burn than Li nuclei,\none could imagine a powerful test for the extent to which depletion of Li has\noperated in metal-poor dwarfs, with important implications for the Li constraint\non Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). Realistic modeling of BeB evolution at\nearly epochs may also help distinguish between predictions of standard BBN,\nnon-standard BBN, and the accretion hypothesis (see Yoshii, Mathews, & Kajino\n1995).\nAn age ranking of metal-poor stars based on their BeB abundances, in\ncombination with measurements of their alpha, iron-peak, and neutron-capture\nelements, would open the door for an unraveling of the mass spectrum of the\nprogenitors of first generation SNeIIs, and allow one to obtain direct constraints\non their elemental yields as a function of mass, a key component to models of\nearly nucleosynthesis.\nAcknowledgments.
