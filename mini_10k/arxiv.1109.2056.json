We have constructed a complete sample of cosmic voids (devoid of galaxies\nbrighter than Mr \u2212 5 log h = \u221220.17) with radii larger than 10 h\u22121 Mpc up to redshift 0.12. Disk galaxies\nin shells around these voids have been used to look for particular alignments between the angular momentum of the galaxies and the radial direction of the voids. We find that disk galaxies around voids larger\nthan & 15 h\u22121 Mpc within distances not much larger than 5 h\u22121 Mpc from the surface of the voids present\na significant tendency to have their angular momenta aligned with the void's radial direction with a significance & 98.8% against the null hypothesis. The strenght of this alignment is dependent on the void's\nradius and for voids with . 15 h\u22121 Mpc the distribution of the orientation of the galaxies is compatible\nwith a random distribution. Finally, we find that this trend observed in the alignment of galaxies is similar\nto the one observed for the minor axis of dark matter halos around cosmic voids found in cosmological\nsimulations, suggesting a possible link in the evolution of both components.\nSubject headings: Large Scale Structure: Voids; Galaxies : General\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nrecently, Navarro et al. (2004) revisited the analysis\ndone by Flin & Godlowski (1986) on the alignment\nof galaxies in the Local Supercluster (LSC) under the\nlight of the Tidal Torque Theory (for a recent review\nabout the Tidal Torque Theory or TTT, see Sch\u00e4fer\n2009). The authors found a tendency of galaxies to\nhave their spin parallel to the plane of the LSC, also\nknown as supergalactic plane, that would support the\npredictions from the TTT.\nHowever, the observational analysis is hindered by\ntwo main difficulties: the accurate determination of the\ndirection of the angular momentum of the galaxies and\nthe determination of the distribution of matter around\n\nThe study of the alignment of galaxies with respect\nto the large scale structure is a recurrent topic still not\nfully settled. The first works studying the alignment of\ngalaxies focused on clusters and superclusters. Studies on the alignment of galaxies in clusters (Adams\net al. 1980) and superclusters (Flin & Godlowski 1986;\nKashikawa & Okamura 1992) claimed to find particular alignments of the galaxies with respect to their\nlocal large scale structure. On the other side, similar\nstudies did not find any particular alignment (Helou &\nSalpeter 1982; Dekel 1985; Garrido et al. 1993). More\n\n1\n\n\fthem. The determination of the spin of disk galaxies\ncan be guessed by the shape of the galaxy, considering\nthat galaxies spin around their minor axis. However,\nthere is still an indetermination due to projection effects since in most of the cases it is not possible to\nknow which half, of the two in which a galaxy is divided by its major axis, is closer to the observer. The\npresence of dust lanes or the use of kinematic data can\nhelp to solve this degeneracy but in most of the cases\nthis information is not available. To deal with this\nproblem some authors have taken all the possibilities\nof the spin as independent ones (Kashikawa & Okamura 1992) while others have opted for taking just one\npossibility (Lee & Erdogdu 2007).\nRegarding the accurate determination of the mass\ndistribution around the galaxies, the main problem\ncomes from the effects of the proper motion of galaxies\nwhich introduces uncertainties in the conversion from\nredshift to distances.\nTo overcome both problems, Trujillo et al. (2006,\nhereafter T06) proposed the use of spiral galaxies seen\nedge-on or face-on (so the direction of the spin vector is better determined) located in the shells around\ncosmic voids. The advantage of the regions around\nlarge cosmic voids is that the direction of the gradient\nof density is strongly aligned with the radial direction\nwhich can be determined in a robust way despite the\nuncertainties of converting redshifts in distances. Using this technique and data from the third data release\nof the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-DR3) and the\n2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS), T06 found a\ntendency of galaxies around shells of voids to have\ntheir spin vector perpendicular to the radial direction.\nCuesta et al. (2008) working on cosmological simulations of dark matter halos around voids found results\nin apparent agreement with those of T06. The simulations show that the angular momentum of the dark\nmatter halos tend to be also aligned to the perpendicular direction. In both cases, the results were in agreement with the prediction done using the TTT (Lee &\nPen 2000), that the angular momentum would tend to\nbe aligned with the intermediate axis of the tidal shear\ntensor, that in the surface of the voids is in the perpendicular direction.\nHowever, recently, Slosar & White (2009, hereafter\nS09) have redone a similar analysis, but using a larger\nsample of galaxies from the SDSS-DR6, obtaining a\nresult that is consistent with a random distribution of\norientations, in contrast with the previous results.\nIn this work, we revisit the analysis of the alignment\n\nof galaxies around voids with two significant improvements with respect to those two previous works. First,\nwe make use of the latest data release of the SDSS, i.e.\nSDSS-DR7, and we combine it with the morphological classification from the Galaxy Zoo project (Banerji\net al. 2010; Lintott et al. 2010) to select disk galaxies.\nSecond, we have developed a statistical procedure to\npartially correct the indetermination in the spin direction due to the projection effect so we can obtain information also from galaxies that are not edge-on or faceon, increasing by a factor of 3 the effective number of\ngalaxies that are used in our analysis with respect to\nthe restriction to edge-on and face-on galaxies.\nThe outline of this Paper is as follows. Section 2\npresents the data used for our analysis; Section 3 describes the procedure to search for voids; Section 4 is\ndevoted to the selection of galaxies and the computation of their alignments; Section 5 contains the final\nresults; in Section 6 the results are discussed and compared with previous works and in Section 7 the summary of the resuls are presented.\nThrough this paper we assume a \u039bCDM cosmological model with \u03a9 M = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7 and\nH0 = 100 h km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 .\n2.\n\nThe data\n\nOn what follows we describe the data that we have\nused to: a) create a sample of cosmic voids, and b)\nobtain a sample of galaxies in the shells surrounding\nthem to explore the orientation of galaxies in the large\nscale structure.\nOur main source of data has been the New York\nUniversity Value-Added Galaxy Catalog1 (NYU-VACG,\nBlanton et al. 2005; Padmanabhan et al. 2008; AdelmanMcCarthy et al. 2008), which is based on the photometric and spectroscopic catalog of the SDSS-DR72 (Strauss\net al. 2002). The main characteristics of the NYUVACG are:\n\u2022 Spectroscopically complete up to r \u223c 17.8 (extinction corrected)\n\u2013 Completeness \u223c 99%\n\u2013 Success rate \u223c 99.9%\n\u2022 \u03bc50 (r \u2212 band) \u2264 24.5mag arcsec\u22122\n1 http://sdss.physics.nyu.edu/vagc/\n2 http://cas.sdss.org/astrodr7/en/\n\n2\n\n\f2.1.\n\n\u2022 \u223c 90 targets/deg2\n\n2.3.\n\n\u2022 Median(z)=0.104\n\nAnother important requirement of the galaxy catalog to be suitable to search for voids is the homogeinity. One common test of homogeinity is the hV/Vmax i\ntest, for which a value of 0.5 is expected for an homogenous distribution.\nTo perform this test, first of all, for each galaxy it is\ncomputed the volume, V, of the sphere with radius the\ndistance along the line-of-sight to it. Then, the maximum of all the volumes, Vmax , is found and the ratio\nV/Vmax is obtained for each galaxy. The final step is to\ncalculate the average value of these ratios, hV/Vmax i.\nFor our galaxy catalog hV/Vmax i = 0.49990, confirming that at large scale the distribution of galaxies\nin our volume is homogeneous.\n\nSelection of the sample of galaxies\n\nWe have established thresholds in absolute magnitude, Mrlim , and redshift, zlim , in order to maximize\nthe amount of galaxies while keeping the final sample complete in spectroscopy. The completeness of the\ninitial catalog is a basic requirement to avoid the detection of spurious voids.\nIn Figure 1 it is plotted the number of galaxies with\nMr \u2264 Mrlim (z) as a function of the redshift. The value of\nMrlim (z) corresponds to completeness limit (r = 17.8)\nat each redshift z. From the peak of this distribution\nwe obtain the limits of our final sample:\n\n2.2.\n\nHomogeinity check\n\n\u2022 z \u2264 0.12\n\n3.\n\n\u2022 Mr \u2212 5 log h \u2264 \u221220.173\n\nWith the catalog of galaxies described in the previous section, we proceed to search for cosmic voids on\nit. In this section we describe the procedure followed\nto construct our catalog of voids.\n\nVolume trimming\n\nAlthough we focus our analysis in the largest continuous volume of SDSS-DR7, the irregular limits of\nthe volume still posed difficulties in the reliable detection of voids. For this reason, we have defined new regular limits minimizing the detection of spurious voids\nwhile still keeping \u223c 90% of the original volume.\nFigure 2 shows the limits of our trimmed volume,\nprojected onto the original distribution of galaxies, defined as follows:\n\nCatalog of voids\n\n3.1.\n\nProcedure description\n\nFirst of all, we need to establish the definition of\n\"void\" that we use in our analysis. We have opted\nfor the simplest one: a spherical volume devoid of\nany galaxy brighter than our completeness limit. This\ndefinition has been already used in other works such\nas Patiri et al. (2006a), Patiri et al. (2006b), Trujillo\net al. (2006), Brunino et al. (2007), and Cuesta et al.\n(2008). Cuesta et al. (2008) found that for dark matter\nhaloes in cosmological simulations, using ellipsoidal\nvoids instead of spherical ones does not affect significantly their results. This gives us confidence in the use\nof spherical voids for our analysis.\nApart from minor differences, the procedure that\nwe have followed is basically the HB Void Finder described in Patiri et al. (2006a). These are the basic\nsteps:\n\n\u2022 \u03b4 > 0\u25e6 [Southern limit]\n\u2022 \u03b4 < \u22122.555556 (\u03b1 \u2212 131\u25e6 ) [Western limit]\n\u2022 \u03b4 < 1.70909 (\u03b1 \u2212 235\u25e6 ) [Eastern limit]\n#\n\"\n\u25e6\n0.93232 sin(\u03b1\u221295.9 )\n[Northern\n\u2022 \u03b4 < arcsin \u221a\n\u25e6\n1\u2212[0.93232 cos(\u03b1\u221295.9 )]2\n\nlimit]\n\n1. Random points are thrown within the volume of\nthe catalog.\n\nTable 1 summarizes the main properties of the reference catalog that we have used in our search for cosmic voids.\n\n2. For each trial point, the 4 closest galaxies are\nfound and the center and radius of the sphere\ndefined by these 4 galaxies are computed and\nstored.\n\n3 We\n\nopted for no applying a k-correction due to the small redshift\nrange probe and the high uncertainties in its determination.\n\n3.

They put artificial\ngalaxies in the limits of the survey, allowing voids to be defined by\nthree real galaxies and one fake one.\n\n4\n\n\fobtained from the Galaxy Zoo catalog (Banerji et al.\n2010; Lintott et al. 2010), which provides robust distinction between elliptical and disk galaxies, although\n\u223c 52% of the galaxies remain classified as \"uncertain\".\nWe select only those galaxies classified as \"spiral\" in\nthe Galaxy Zoo catalog (\u223c 37%) because for them the\ndirection of the angular momentum is well defined by\ntheir minor axes.\nThis results in a final sample of 45522 measurements, from 32374 single galaxies, that has been used\nto study the alignment of their angular momentum\nwith respect to the void.7 The use of measurements of\ngalaxies falling in more than one shell is justified because the small uncertainties introduced are compensated by the increase in the size of the sample.\nIn the following sections we describe in detail how\nthis alignment has been computed.\n\nIn summary, the voids selected for our final catalogs\nfulfill the following conditions:\n1. They are empty of galaxies from the initial catalog, i.e. Mr < \u221220.17 + 5 log h.\n2. Their radius is larger than 10 h\u22121 Mpc.\n3. They are completely inside the surveyed volume.5\n4. Voids do not overlap, i.e. the distance between\nthe centers of two voids is larger than the sum of\ntheir radii.\nThe power of this procedure to produce a complete\ncatalog of voids depends critically on the relation between the density of galaxies, the size of the voids\nand the number of trial points used in the search. We\nhave performed several tests and have found that using\n\u223c 109 initial random points (corresponding to a density of \u223c 35 (h\u22121 Mpc)\u22123 trial points) ensures that the\ncompleteness of our catalog of voids is > 99%.\nThe final outcome of this procedure is a complete\ncatalog of 699 non-overlapping cosmic voids with radius larger than 10 h\u22121 Mpc. We found a median radius\nof 11.85 h\u22121 Mpc and the average density of voids is\n32.2 \u00d7 10\u22123 (h\u22121 Mpc)\u22123 .6\nTable 2 provides the main information of these\nvoids. For each void, we include the position of\nthe center, both in Cartesian coordinates (X, Y, Z), and\nequatorial coordinates (\u03b1, \u03b4) and redshift z; and the radius (R). The Cartesian coordinates are computed as\nfollows:\nX\n\n=\n\nD(z) cos \u03b4 cos \u03b1\n\nY\n\n=\n\nD(z) cos \u03b4 sin \u03b1\n\nZ\n\n=\n\nD(z) sin \u03b4\n\n4.1.\n\nThe advantage of studying galaxies around voids is\nthat, on average, the density increases radially. This\nmakes the radial direction a good proxy for the distribution of matter around each galaxy. Therefore, we\nuse the minor axis of the galaxies to define the orientation of their angular momentum, and the radial direction of the voids to characterize the distribution of\nmatter around them. Hence, our analysis is focused on\nthe angle between these two directions, \u03b8.8 For practical reasons, in the context of this work we will use\nthe expression \"radial direction\" to mean the direction\ndefined by a galaxy and the center of the corresponding void, and \"perpendicular direction\" to mean any\ndirection perpendicular to the radial direction.\nTo compute the angle \u03b8 we need to define the direction of the angular momentum or spin, s, of each\ngalaxy. We do this, first of all, by computing the inclination angle between the plane of the galaxy disk and\nthe line of sight, \u03b6. Following Haynes & Giovanelli\n(1984) and Lee & Erdogdu (2007)9 , we use a model of\nthick disk with a projected minor-to-major axis ratio\na/b and an intrinsic flatness f (i.e. the ratio between\nthe real minor axis and the real major axis). According\n\nwhere D(z) is the comoving radial distance.\n4.\n\nComputation of the alignment\n\nCatalog of galaxies in shells around voids\n\nUsing the previous catalog of voids, we extract\nthose galaxies within shells of 10 h\u22121 Mpc around each\nof them.

Betancort-Rijo & Trujillo (2009) provide an\nanalytical model for the distribution of the angle \u03b8, or\nto be more precise, of |cos \u03b8|, P(|cos \u03b8|). From theoretical principles confirmed by simulations, the authors\nfound that P(|cos \u03b8|) is well described by the expression:\n\n(1)\n\nFor values of b/a < f , the angle is set to 0.\nThe flatness f depends on the morphological type\nof the galaxies and we use an average value of 0.14.\nFrom Equation (1) it is easy to see that to a single\nvalue of b/a corresponds two values of \u03b6: \u03b6+ = |\u03b6|\nand \u03b6\u2212 = \u2212|\u03b6|. The indetermination is irrelevant for\n\u03b6 = 0 (edge-on galaxies) and for \u03b6 = \u00b1\u03c0/2 (face-on\ngalaxies).\nTo compute the spin vector s we followed the prescription by T06. According to this, if (\u03b1,\u03b4) are the\nequatorial coordinates of a galaxy, \u03b6 the inclination angle obtained from Equation (1) and \u03c6 is the position\nangle of the galaxy increasing counterclockwise (i.e.\nfrom north to east in the plane of the sky), the components of s are:\n\nsx\n\n=\n\nsy\n\n=\n\nP(\u03bc) =\n\np=\n\n(7)\n\n1\n\u22121\nh|cos \u03b8|i\n\n(8)\n\nBesides, the values of p are related with the existence or absence of particular alignment between the\nvectors r and s according to the following criteria:\n\ncos \u03b1 cos \u03b4 sin \u03b6\n\np < 1. r and s tend to be parallel.\n\nsin \u03b1 cos \u03b4 sin \u03b6\n\np = 1.

This alternative expression is characterized by a parameter c and, from the comparison between Equation (9) of S09 and Equation (7) of the\n\n(5)\n\nHaving obtained r and s, the angle between them, \u03b8,\nit is computed as:\ns*r\n\u03b8 = arccos\n|s||r|\n\n!\n(6)\n\n6\n\n\f5.\n\npresent work, it is possible to obtain the following expression relating both characteristic parameters:\ns\n3c\np= 1+\n(9)\n2(1 \u2212 c)\n4.3.\n\nResults\n\nUsing the procedure described in Appendix A, we\nhave computed the corrected distribution Pc (|cos \u03b8|)\nof the sample of galaxies around voids. Given the\nlarge size of our initial sample, we have also computed\nPc (|cos \u03b8|) for different subsamples combining different sizes of voids and shells around them.\nAn important point of our analysis has been to establish the significance of our results in a robust way.\nThis is done by comparing, in each case, the measured signal with the standard deviation \u03c3h|cos \u03b8|i of\nthe theoretical distribution in case of null signal, i.e.\nh|cos \u03b8|i = 0.5.10 In the situation of complete knowledge\np of the real values of \u03b6, we would have \u03c3h|cos \u03b8|i =\n( 12 \u00d7 Ng )\u22121 for a sample of Ng measures. However,\nwe have already shown that our procedure has uncertainties equivalent to a sample of size 0.6 Ng , therefore,\nthe previous expression needs to be corrected to\n\nStatistical computation of P(|cos \u03b8|)\n\nDifferent approaches have been used to deal with\nthe indetermination of the values of \u03b6. For example,\nKashikawa & Okamura (1992) uses the two values of\n\u03b6 independently. Another possibility is to use just one\nsign in the definition of \u03b6 as done by Lee & Erdogdu\n(2007). However, these authors acknowledge that this\ndecreases the strength of the measured alignment.\nOn the other hand, T06 and S09 have overcome the\nproblem with the indetermination of the values of \u03b6 using only edge-on and face-on galaxies, for which the\ndirection of the spin is well determined. The main disadvantage of this approach is that the number of galaxies suitable for computing P(|cos \u03b8|) is greatly reduced.\nFor example, using the criteria from T06, the fraction\nof galaxies that can be used is \u223c 22% of all the disk\ngalaxies.\nWe opted for a statistical approach that allows to\ncompute a corrected distribution Pc (|cos \u03b8|) from the\ncombination of the distributions P(|cos \u03b8|) obtained using both signs.\nIn Appendix A we describe in detail this procedure.\nWe also show in this appendix the results from several\nMonte Carlo simulations that show the ability of the\nprocedure to recover the correct values of p (Table 7).\nThe fact that we actually do not know the real values of \u03b6 is reflected in the uncertainties of the procedure. Although the values of p are well recovered, the\nuncertainties measured from the simulations are larger\nthan those expected from considering just the size of\nthe sample, Ng . Of course, this is because we are not\nusing the real values of \u03b6. Nevertheless, from the simulations we have obtained that our procedure has a predictibility power equivalent to that of a sample 0.6 Ng\nwith complete knowledge of the real values of \u03b6. Let's\nremember that the common procedure of using only\nface-on or edge-on galaxies is restricted to \u223c 20% of\nthe total amount of spiral galaxies. This means that\nour statistical procedure increases by a factor of 3 the\neffective number of galaxies with respect to previous\nworks.\n\n\u03c3h|cos \u03b8|i = p\n\n1\n12 \u00d7 0.6 \u00d7 Ng\n\n.\n\n(10)\n\nKnowing the value of \u03c3h|cos \u03b8|i , we can establish the\nsignal to noise ratio (S NR) of the signal of a subsample\nof Ng measurements as:\nS NR =\n\n0.5 \u2212 h|cos \u03b8|icorr\n,\n\u03c3h|cos \u03b8|i\n\n(11)\n\nwhere h|cos \u03b8|icorr is obtained from the statistical\ncorrection and \u03c3h|cos \u03b8|i from Equation (10). Note that\nthe denominator is the signal, which corresponds to the\ndifference between the observed value of h|cos \u03b8|icorr\nand that of the random distribution which is 0.5. For\npractical reasons, the sign of S NR has been chosen so\nthat is positive for values of p > 1 (h|cos \u03b8|icorr < 0.5)\nand negative for values of p < 1 (h|cos \u03b8|icorr > 0.5).\nIn Tables 4 and 5 are shown the main results of our\nanalysis. In Table 4, samples are constructed by setting a minimum value for the radii of the voids (Rmin\nVoid )\nwhile, in Table 5, samples are constructed using voids\nwith radii in the ranges RVoid \u00b1 0.5 h\u22121 Mpc.11 Apart\nfrom this difference in the definition of the first column, both tables share the description of the rest of the\n10 In\n\nthe analysis of the significance is more convenience the use of\nh|cos \u03b8|i than that of p because the former has a gaussian distribution\nbut the latter has not.\n11 For convenience, we will refer the samples of the first table as \"cumulative\" samples and those of the second table as \"differential\"\nsamples.\n\n7\n\n\fcolumns: S W is the width of the innermost shell in\nh\u22121 Mpc; N is the number of measures of the sample;\nh|cos \u03b8|i is the mean of the |cos \u03b8|; p is the characteristic parameter of Equation (7); and S NR is the signal to\nnoise ratio computed with Equation (11). From simulations it has been found that results obtained with less\nthan \u223c 100 measures are not reliable, therefore, samples with less than this number have been flagged with\na question mark beside the value of the S NR.\nErrors in h|cos \u03b8|i are computed using the standard\ndeviation of |cos \u03b8| resulting from 10000 Monte Carlo\nsimulations with no signal (see below) corrected using\nEquations (B1-B3) assuming the following relation:\n\u03c3h|cos \u03b8|i (p = 1; sim)\n\u03c3h|cos \u03b8|i (p , 1; corr)\n=\n\u03c3h|cos \u03b8|i (p , 1; theo) \u03c3h|cos \u03b8|i (p = 1; theo)\n\nThe relation between the strength of the alignment\nand the radius of the void is clearly shown in Figure 4 where the differential samples are used. For\nvoids smaller than \u223c 15 h\u22121 Mpc these results are compatible with a random distribution. It is for voids\n& 15 h\u22121 Mpc when it appears a signal of alignment,\nalthough given the smaller size of the samples the\nhighest significance reached is 2.96 for voids with\n16 h\u22121 Mpc \u2264 RVoid \u2264 17 h\u22121 Mpc and a shell of\n6 h\u22121 Mpc.\nFigure 6 shows the corrected histograms of \u03b8 values (see Equation A5) for the cases in which is reached\nthe maximum S NR for the cumulative (left panel) and\nthe differential samples (right panel). The continuous\nred line shows the analytical model described by Equation (7) with the p values corresponding to these two\nmaxima.\nTo compute in a more robust way the significance\nlevel of our results we need to compare them with a\ncontrol sample with no signal. To construct this control sample, we have run 10000 Monte Carlo simulations in which the spin direction of the galaxies (determined by their position angles and axial ratios) has\nbeen shuffled so that each galaxy it is assigned the spin\ndirection of any other galaxy randomly selected. This\nprocedure has the advantage of ensuring the randomness of the spin distribution and, therefore, the lack of\nany alignment signal, while using real data.\nFor each simulation we have repeated the analysis\nperformed in the real data using cumulative subsamples, and we have also computed 2 statistics used both\nin the real data and in the simulations. These statistics\nwere computed as follows: for each bin in RVoid , the\nmean (median) value of the S NR measured in the 10\ndifferent shell widths was computed and the extreme\nvalue (i.e. with highest absolute value) of each simulation was kept.\nThe significance level from each statistic is computed as\n1 \u2212 2 f (extreme{S NRS im } < extreme{S NRReal }),\nwhere f (extreme(S NRS im ) < extreme{S NRReal }) is\nthe fraction of simulations with extreme values of the\nmean (median) of SNR lower than the observed ones\n(-2.73 for the mean; -3.10 for the median). The fact\nof multiplying by two the observed fraction takes into\naccount that we are considering only one side of the\ndistribution of the statistics.\nThe results from this analysis are summarized in\nTable 3. Using the mean we obtain a significance of\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u03c3h|cos \u03b8|i (p; theo) is computed using the theoretical expressions described in Equations (B1-B3),\n\u03c3h|cos \u03b8|i (p = 1; sim) is computed from the simulations\nand \u03c3h|cos \u03b8|i (p , 1; corr) is the final value used in Tables 4-5.\nSince p does not follow a Gaussian distribution,\nfor this parameter we provide the confidence levels at\n1\u03c3 again correcting the theoretical values from Equations (B5-B6) with the confidence levels measured\nfrom the simulations with no signal.\nIn Figures 3 and 4 are plotted the values of p (upper\npanels) and S NR (lower panels) as a function of the\nradius of the voids, for the cumulative and differential samples, respectively. In the first figure the plotted\nradius is the minimum radius of each sample and in\nthe second the central radius of each bin. In different\ncolors are plotted the 10 shells widths that have been\nexplored.\nThe first result is that p < 1 for most of the subsamples. This means that the direction of the spin of the\ngalaxies tends to be parallel to the radial direction of\nthe void. Despite of the large sample that we are using\nand the additional statistical correction, we find that\nthe significance of the signal is not high most of the\ntimes and is dependent on the radius of the voids. The\nhighest significance is reached when selecting galaxies around voids, larger than 16 h\u22121 Mpc in shells of\n3 h\u22121 Mpc (|S NR| > 3.6) using 179 galaxies, but the\n|S NR| is higher than 3 increasing the width of the shell\nup to 7 h\u22121 Mpc and the sample size to 614 galaxies.\nTherefore, the further the galaxies are from the surface\nof the void, the lower is the signal although the increase in the size sample keeps the significance high.\n8\n\n\fdius & 15 h\u22121 Mpc and within a shell not larger than\n\u223c 5 h\u22121 Mpc, disk galaxies present a significant tendency to have their spin vectors aligned with the radial\ndirection of the void.\nThe maximum |S NR| = 3.62 is measured for\nvoids with RVoid \u2265 16 h\u22121 Mpc and a shell width\nof 3 h\u22121 Mpc with a strength of the alignment p =\n0.664+0.083\n\u22120.074 . However, this value gives an overestimation of the real strength since has been selected as the\nbest case out of many subsamples.\nIn the next sections we compare our results with\nprevious empirical works and with results from numerical simulations.\n\n98.8% which improves slightly to 99.5% if the median\nis used instead.\nAlthough this test ensures the existence of a global\nsignal, we have also checked that the increase of the\nS NR with the radius of the voids shown in Tables 4\nand 5 is not just a consequence of the variation in the\nsize of the samples. Figure 5 shows the dependence of\nthe S NR with the size of the samples (Ng ). For clarity\npurposes we have restricted the analysis to the voids\nlarger than 14 h\u22121 Mpc. Each line corresponds to different limits in RVoid and each point corresponds to a\nshell width. It can be seen that all subsamples show a\nsimilar trend with the width of the shell, showing the\nmaximum value of S NR, in absolute value, at intermediate shell widths. Also, for subsamples with similar\nsizes, the S NR shows variations depending on the size\nof the voids and shells, rejecting the hypothesis that\nthe variations of the S NR are due only to variations of\nthe size of the samples.\nFinally, to check the dependence of the significance of the signal with the distance of the galaxies\nto the surface of the void, we have constructed subsamples containing galaxies closer than 5 h\u22121 Mpc of\nthe voids' surface and galaxies between 5 h\u22121 Mpc and\n10 h\u22121 Mpc. With these two groups of galaxies we\nhave repeated the analysis (only cumulative). In Table 6 are presented the results of this analysis which\nshow that galaxies at distances larger than 5 h\u22121 Mpc\ndo not present any significance alignment.\n6.\n\n6.1.\n\nFrom the observational point of view, T06 and,\nmore recently, S09 have performed a similar analysis\nto the one done here. T06 analysed 201 face-on and\nedge-on galaxies around voids with R > 10 h\u22121 Mpc\nusing data from the SDSS-DR3 and the 2dFRGS. They\nfound a significant tendency of the spin of the galaxies\nto be in the direction perpendicular to the radial direction of the void. More recently, S09 using two samples\nof 578 and 258 galaxies from the SDSS-DR6 with similar selection criteria found no statistical evidence for\ndeparture from random orientations.\nUsing the same criteria on the size of the voids\n(RVoid > 10 h\u22121 Mpc) and on the width of the shell\n(4 h\u22121 Mpc) as in those previous works, we find no significance alignment (p = 0.998; S NR = \u22120.15; see\nTable 4). The size of the sample used to establish this\nresult is of 11060 galaxies, which after applying the\ncorrection factor of 0.6, means an equivalent size of\n6636 galaxies. This number is 8 times larger the size\nused by S09.\nFor a better comparison, we have computed the signal of the alignment using criteria similar to that of S09\nregarding the selection of spiral galaxies (g \u2212 r < 0.6)\nand the definition of edge-on (b/a < 0.27) and face-on\n(b/a < 0.96) galaxies12 . However, we keep our limit\nin Mr instead of using Mr > \u221221 + 5 log h as done\nby S09 because otherwise the final number of galaxies\nwould be too small. After applying these criteria, we\nfinished with a sample of 252 face-on and edge-on spiral galaxies. The value of p obtained with this sample\nis 0.993 with a S NR = 0.1 and, therefore, compatible\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe have analysed a large sample of galaxies around\n699 voids with radius larger than 10 h\u22121 Mpc up to\nz = 0.12.

The continuous line corresponds to the theoretical model described by\nEquation (7) for the measured value of p, shown in the upper left corners.\nwith a random distribution.\nIn relation to T06, it is important to note that in\nthat work, the signal presented corresponds to the peak\nof the signal found after exploring in shells of different widths. Consequently, to properly address the signification of the signal in T06 we have reviewed the\ndata used in that paper taking into account this exploration. To do this, we have run simulations with\nsimilar number of galaxies around similar voids (R >\n10 h\u22121 Mpc) searching for the maximum of the |S NR|\nin shells of width from 3 h\u22121 Mpc to 7 h\u22121 Mpc in steps\nof 0.1 h\u22121 Mpc. Then, it has been computed the fraction of simulations with max(|S NR|) larger than the\none found in T06 when only SDSS data was used\n(max(S NRT 06;S DS S ) = 2)13 . After doing our analysis we found that \u223c 16% of the simulations showed\nmax(|S NR|) > 2, decreasing the significance of the result of T06 to \u223c 84%.\nAnother observational work on alignment of galaxies with respect to the local large scale structure is\nthat by Lee & Erdogdu (2007). In this paper, the authors computed the shear tidal tensor in the position of\neach galaxy and measured the angle between each of\nthe principal axes and the spin direction of the galaxy.\nThey found a significant alignment (> 6\u03c3) between\nthe direction of the spin and the intermediate principal axis of the shear tidal tensor.14 Nevertheless, the\n\ncomparison with our results is not direct since we do\nnot use a direct measure of the orientation of the shear\ntidal tensor in the position of each galaxy and the radial direction of the voids can be considered only as a\nstatistical proxy for the direction of the major principal axis of the shear tidal tensor. Given the differences\nin methodology, a meaningful comparison of the results from both works would need an analysis that it is\nbeyond the scope of this paper.\n6.2.\n\nComparison with numerical simulations\n\nAnother way to study the alignment of galaxies\nwith their local large scale environment is through numerical simulations (Porciani et al. 2002a,b; Navarro\net al. 2004; Bailin & Steinmetz 2005; Bailin et al.\n2005; Altay et al. 2006; Patiri et al. 2006b; Brunino\net al. 2007; Arag\u00f3n-Calvo et al. 2007; Cuesta et al.\n2008; Zhang et al. 2009; Hahn et al. 2010; Bett et al.\n2010). Since the behaviour of the halos can be dependent on the environment or the large scale structure in which they reside, to perform a meaningful\ncomparison we have focused on the analysis done by\nPatiri et al. (2006b), Brunino et al. (2007) and Cuesta\net al. (2008) in which it was studied the orientation\nof dark matter halos around cosmic voids using different cosmological simulations. The criteria imposed\nto the dark matter halos and the procedure to detect\nvoids tried to match the criteria used in T06. All three\nworks found that the minor axis and the major axis\n\n13 In\n\nthe process of conducting this analysis we noted some duplications in a few galaxies that make the measured S NR decreases from\n2.4 to 2.\n14 The authors obtained a value of c = 0.084\u00b10.014 which corresponds\n\nto p = 1.057 \u00b1 0.012\n\n15\n\n\fof the halos have significant tendencies to be aligned\nwith the radial and the perpendicular directions, respectively. The results regarding the orientation of\nthe angular momentum of the halos were less clear.\nPatiri et al. (2006b) did not find any particular orientation for the angular momentum of the halos. Brunino\net al. (2007) also did not found any particular alignment for the angular momentum in their full sample of\nhalos although they detected a tendency for those halos\nwith a disc-dominated galaxy to have their angular momentum perpendicular to the radial direction. Finally,\nCuesta et al. (2008) measured a significant (> 7\u03c3) tendency of the spin of the dark matter halos to lie in\nthe plane perpendicular to the radial direction. However, the same authors found that the strength of the\nalignment is mainly produced by the outer regions of\nthe DM halos and this would explain the discrepancies\nwith Brunino et al. (2007) were the inner regions of the\nDM were used to measure the alignment.\nHow these results relate with ours is not straightforward since we observe the collapsed baryonic matter\nand they studied the dark matter or the non-collapsed\nbaryonic matter. We can only point out the fact that\nthe alignment that we find in the galaxies is shared by\nthe minor axis of the halos studied in the simulations,\neither dark matter or gas halos. This is suggestive to\nan interaction between the galaxy and the hosting halos around it (either of dark or baryonic matter) leading to a tendency of the minor axis of the galaxy (and,\ntherefore, its angular momentum) to be aligned with\nthe minor axis of the halo's matter distribution.\n7.\n\ntion from the Galaxy Zoo project to get a reliable sample of disk galaxies.\nSecond and more important, we have introduced a\nstatistical procedure that has allowed us to overcome\nthe problem of the indetermination of the real inclination of galaxies computed from their apparent axial\nratio. We have performed extensive Monte Carlo simulations to check the validity of this procedure. We\nshow that the procedure recover the real signal without\npractically any bias and its power in terms of capacity\nto reject the null hypothesis it is equivalent to the case\nin which it is used a sample with complete knowledge\nof the real direction of the spin of the galaxies using\n60% the amount of galaxies. In comparison with the\ncommon procedure of selecting only edge-on and faceon galaxies, this procedure means an increase of about\na factor 3 in the amount of measurements used in the\nanalysis of the alignment.\nThese improvements have allowed us to detect a\nstatistically significant (& 98.8%) tendency of galaxies around very large voids (R & 15h\u22121 Mpc) to have\ntheir angular momentum align with the radial direction\nof the voids. However, for smaller voids this tendency\ndisappears and the results are consistent with no special alignment.\nWe have also found that the strength of the alignment depends on the distance of the galaxies to the\nsurface of the voids and for galaxies further than\n\u223c 5 h\u22121 Mpc the distribution of the alignments is compatible with a random distribution independent of the\nsize of the voids.\nPrevious similar works found opposite alignment\n(T06) or no alignment (S09). However, these works\nused too few galaxies around voids with R \u2265 10 h\u22121 Mpc\nwhich, according to our work, could mask the signal.\nIn fact, using the same criteria for the size of the voids\nand the width of the shells as in those works, our data\nis compatible with a random distribution of spins without any particular alignment, as found by S09.\nThe comparison with the results from cosmological simulations points to a possible connection between the alignment of the halos (of dark matter and\nnon-collapse baryonic matter) and that of the galaxies which could explain the similar orientation of both\ncomponents observed in the simulations and in our\nwork, respectively.\n\nSummary\n\nAnalysing a volume of \u223c 27 \u00d7 106 (h\u22121 Mpc)3 from\nthe SDSS-DR7 we have searched for cosmic voids devoid of galaxies brighter than Mr \u2212 5 log h = \u221220.17\nand with RVoid > 10 h\u22121 Mpc. We have found 699 non\noverlapping voids for which we provide positions and\nsizes.\nWe have used this catalog of voids to search for disk\ngalaxies around them and study the alignment between\nthe direction of the angular momentum of these galaxies and the radial direction with respect to the center of\nthe voids.\nWe have included two improvements with respect\nto previous similar works.\nFirst, we have used an updated version of the SDSS\nspectroscopic catalog (data release 7) and we have\ncombined it with the visual morphological classifica-\n\nREFERENCES\nAdams, M.

We also show its validity and robustness using Monte\nCarlo simulations.\nA.1.\n\nMathematical justification of the procedure\n\nIn the analysis of the alignment of galaxies, one of the main sources of uncertainty is the indetermination in the\ninclination of the plane of a disk galaxy with respect to the line of sight \u00b1\u03b6 using exclusively the observed axial ratio\nb/a of the galaxies (see Equation 1). In other words, if a galaxy is divided in two halves separated by its major axis, it\nis not possible to know which of the two halves is the closest to the observer.15 This indetermination is negligible for\nedge-on (b/a \u223c 0) and face-on galaxies (b/a \u223c 1) but using only these galaxies reduces the sample size to \u223c 1/5 of\nthe original one. As we increase the range of allowed values of b/a, the increasing uncertainties in \u03b6 will result in an\nincreasing degradation of any existing alignment but the statistics improve. The question is whether this improvement\nof the statistics can compensate for the increasing degradation of any possible signal. The answer is \"yes\". Choosing\nalways the plus sign in the computation of \u03b6 , or the minus sign, or any random assignment of signs, leads to the same\nstatistical results (i.e. they are equally powerful tests), which are better than those obtained with any limitation of the\nrange of possible values of b/a. However, the estimate of the alignment obtained in this manner is biased towards\nsmaller values (the strength of the alignment is given by (1 \u2212 p) ' \u22123c/4 for weak alignments). This would not be\nmuch of a problem, because one may calibrate the procedure using Monte Carlo simulations and then correct for the\nbiasing. In this manner we have found (see Table 7):\n1 \u2212 p+ ' 0.6(1 \u2212 p)\n\n(A1)\n\nwhere p corresponds to the real alignment and p+ is the value obtained using the plus sign for \u03b6.\nThe main problem with the use of p+ , or any other sign assignment, is that it introduces an artificial randomness that\nincreases the scatter of the estimates. Using p+ , we assign the correct sign to half of the galaxies, on average, while\nthe other half gets the wrong sign, but the exact number of galaxies getting the correct sign fluctuates from sample to\nsample (with variance Ng /4, being Ng the size of the sample) resulting in an increased error. Furthermore, since we do\nnot take into account the other possible sign assignment, we do not know how large is the degradation of the alignment\nimplied by those galaxies that get the wrong sign.\nTo avoid these problems we propose a method that uses all the information in the data and does not introduce\nartificial randomness. To this end, we consider the two possible values of \u03b8 associated with every galaxy (one value\nfor each possible sign of \u03b6) and assume that only half of the values of \u03b8 falling in a given range are correct while the\nother half is incorrect. The correct values for the latter half of galaxies would be the conjugate of \u03b8, \u03b80 , corresponding\nto the value of \u03b8 using the opposite sign for \u03b6. Thus, if the actual probability distribution for \u03b8 were:16\nP\u0304(cos \u03b8, p) =\n\n(1 +\n\n(p2\n\np\n,\n\u2212 1) cos2 \u03b8)3/2 )\n\n(A2)\n\nthe probability distribution that would be inferred from the 2Ng values of \u03b8 treating them as if they were independent,\nP(cos \u03b8), would be given, for the j \u2212 th bin, by:\nl\n\nP(cos \u03b8 j ) =\n\n1\n1 X\nP\u0304(cos \u03b8 j , p) +\nP\u0304(cos \u03b80j , p),\n2\n2l i=1\n\n(A3)\n\nwhere l is the number of \u03b8 j values in the j \u2212 th bin.\n15 The\n\nuse of kinematic information or the presence of dust lanes can help to break this indetermination, however, in most of the cases this is\ninformation is not accessible.\n16 We are only interested in the direction of the alignment and therefore the analysis can be restricted to 0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0/2 and cos \u03b8 = |cos \u03b8|.\n\n18\n\n\fThis formula expresses the fact that with probability 1/2, the probability density in the bin centered in \u03b8 j is given\nby the real distribution P\u0304 evaluated at \u03b8 j (correct sign assignment), while with probability 1/2, the probability density\nat \u03b8 j is the averaged of the value of P\u0304 over the conjugate values (\u03b80j (i)) of the l values of \u03b8 falling in bin j.\nSo, the factor:\nP\u0304(cos \u03b8 j )\n(A4)\nQ(cos \u03b8 j ) \u2261 1\n1 Pl\n0\ni=1 P\u0304(cos \u03b8 j (i), p)\n2 P\u0304(cos \u03b8 j , p) + 2l\nis an estimate of the ratio between the actual distribution, P\u0304(cos \u03b8 j ), and the first estimate, P(cos \u03b8 j ).\nTherefore, we have for the estimate of P\u0304 (that we denote by Pc ):\nPc (cos \u03b8 j ) = P(cos \u03b8 j )Q(cos \u03b8 j )\n\n(A5)\n\nWhen the alignment is very strong, the assumption that the two values \u03b8, \u03b80 of a conjugate couple have the same\nprobability can no longer be mantained. Instead, we should used:\nProb(\u03b8) =\n\nP(cos \u03b8)\nP(cos \u03b8) + P(cos \u03b80 )\n\n(A6)\n\nProb(\u03b80 ) =\n\nP(cos \u03b80 )\nP(cos \u03b8) + P(cos \u03b80 )\n\n(A7)\n\nand modify the definition of Q consequently. However, this complication of the method is not worthy to our\npurpose. In fact, from Table 7, we can see that even for considerable alignment strengths, the bias implied by neglecting\nthis last refinement is small, and can be corrected by the following expression:\npdb = 1 \u2212 (1 + 0.1(1 \u2212 pc )2 )(1 \u2212 pc )\n\n(A8)\n\nwhere pc is the value obtained using Equation (A5), and pdb is the debiased value.\nFrom Table 7 we can also see that the relative error, \u03c3 p /|1 \u2212 p|, is always larger for p+ or p\u2212 than for pc . For\nweak alignments (|1 \u2212 p| . 0.1) the former is \u223c 20% larger than the latter, while for larger alignments the difference\ndiminishes.\nFinally, it must be noticed that the method that we have just described does not depend on the form of P\u0304(cos \u03b8).\nA.2.\n\nDescription of the procedure\n\nIn this appendix we describe the actual implementation of the method presented above.\nThe procedure is as follows:\n1. For each galaxy, we compute the two possible values of cos \u03b8 corresponding to the two alternatives signs of \u03b6\nand hence the two possible spin orientations.\n2. Then, we construct a normalized histogram assuming the two values of cos \u03b8 of each galaxy as independent\nvalues. The normalization is done dividing each bin by 2 times the total number of galaxies of the sample (Ng )\nand by the width of the bins. We call this non-corrected histogram P(cos \u03b8).\n3. Next, in each bin centered in cos \u03b8 j , we compute the value of the corrected histogram Pc (cos \u03b8) using Equations (A5) and (A4):\nPc (cos \u03b8 j ) = P(cos \u03b8 j ) Q(cos \u03b8 j )\nremembering that\n\n19\n\n(A9)\n\n\fQ(cos \u03b8 j ) =\n\n1\n2 P\u0304(cos \u03b8 j ,\n\nP\u0304(cos \u03b8 j , p)\nP\np) + 2l1 li=1 P\u0304(cos \u03b80j (i), p)\n\nand that \u03b80j (i) are the conjugate values of \u03b8 for those galaxies with \u03b8 j (i) within the interval | \u03b8 j (i) \u2212 \u03b8 j |\u2264 \u2206\u03b8 j /2, l\nis the total number of values within the bin, and\np\n.\n(A10)\nP\u0304(cos \u03b8, p) \u2261\n2\n(1 + (p \u2212 1) cos2 \u03b8)3/2\nThe final corrected value of p is computed numerically using its relationship with hcos \u03b8i from Equation (8), which\ngiven the distribution Pc (cos \u03b8 j ) as a discrete distribution can be expressed as:\nPn\n\nPc (cos \u03b8 j ) cos \u03b8 j\n1\nPn\n=\nP\n(cos\n\u03b8\n)\n1\n+\np\nc\nj\nj=1\n\nj=1\n\n(A11)\n\nwith n the total number of bins in which the distribution is divided.\nA.3.\n\nRobustness of the statistical correction\n\nTo check the robustness of the statistical correction we have performed a series of Monte Carlo simulations. In\nthese simulations, we use samples of fake galaxies in the position of the real ones but with spin directions assigned\nrandomly following a p \u2212 distribution (Equations A2) with a given pinput . Then, the samples of fake galaxies are\nanalysed in the same manner of the real galaxies and a final poutput value is obtained.\nWe have run 2 sets of simulations using two samples with different number of galaxies (Ng ) to check the robustness\nof the procedure also as a function of the sample size. These samples correspond to galaxies in shells of 4 h\u22121 Mpc\nand RVoid > 10 h\u22121 Mpc (Sample A, following the usual criteria used in previous works) and to galaxies in shells\nof 3 h\u22121 Mpc and RVoid > 16 h\u22121 Mpc (Sample B, corresponding to our maximum S NR). For each sample we have\nrun 1000 Monte Carlo realizations with 7 different initial distributions of h|cos \u03b8|i described by their corresponding p\nvalues (pinput ). These values covered the typical values of p that we have found in our analysis.\nTable 7 shows the results of this analysis. For each subset of 1000 realizations we give the size of the sample\nN, the input value pinput , the mean value of p obtained if a fixed sign for \u03b6 is used (p+ and p\u2212 , for plus and minor\nsign, respectively) and the mean value of p when applying our stastical correction, poutput . The uncertainties shown\ncorrespond to 1\u03c3 of the distribution of the single values in the 1000 realizations.\nWe found that for most of the cases the statistically corrected value is within 1\u03c3 of the input value showing the high\naccuracy of the procedure, especially when comparing with the cases in which a fixed sign is used.\nThe results of these simulations have been used to compute the \"effective size\" of the initial sample. This effective\nsize is defined as the size that a sample with complete knowledge of the real signs of \u03b6 for each galaxy should have to\nshow the same uncertainties that we find in our simulations. On what follows, it is described how we have computed\nthe correction factor to be applied to our samples to obtain their effective sizes.\nIt can be proved theoretically that the value of the standard deviation of h|cos \u03b8|i, \u03c3h|cos \u03b8|i , for the case in which there\nis no preferential alignment (p = 1), is:\n1\n\u03c3h|cos \u03b8|i = \u221a\n,\n(A12)\n12N\nwhere N is the total number of galaxies used to compute h|cos \u03b8|i. However, this theoretical expression assumes\nthe full knowledge of the values of \u03b8 for all the galaxies, while empirically we do not have such full information\nbecause of the indetermination in the sign of \u03b6. Therefore, we have compared the standard deviation obtained from the\nsimulations with different values of N, with the theoretical value. From this comparison, we have obtained a correction\nfactor to be applied to the total number of galaxies N equal to 0.6. This means that our statistical approximation carried\nan uncertainty that is equivalent to the uncertainty of having \u223c 60% of the galaxies with full information.\n20\n\n\fSample\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nB\nB\nB\nB\nB\nB\nB\n\nN\n\npinput\n\n11060\n11060\n11060\n11060\n11060\n11060\n11060\n179\n179\n179\n179\n179\n179\n179\n\np+\nhp+ i\n0.664\n0.841\n0.938\n1.000\n1.060\n1.143\n1.272\n0.642\n0.833\n0.938\n0.999\n1.073\n1.162\n1.305\n\n0.50\n0.75\n0.90\n1.00\n1.10\n1.25\n1.50\n0.50\n0.75\n0.90\n1.00\n1.10\n1.25\n1.50\n\n\u03c3 p+\n0.008\n0.010\n0.010\n0.011\n0.012\n0.012\n0.013\n0.060\n0.071\n0.081\n0.088\n0.091\n0.101\n0.113\n\np\u2212\nhp\u2212 i\n0.665\n0.842\n0.938\n1.000\n1.060\n1.142\n1.272\n0.644\n0.830\n0.938\n1.004\n1.072\n1.155\n1.313\n\n\u03c3 p\u2212\n0.008\n0.009\n0.010\n0.011\n0.012\n0.012\n0.014\n0.059\n0.075\n0.085\n0.086\n0.091\n0.100\n0.110\n\npoutput\nhpoutput i \u03c3 poutput\n0.437\n0.010\n0.746\n0.012\n0.900\n0.013\n1.000\n0.014\n1.102\n0.016\n1.256\n0.018\n1.542\n0.025\n0.486\n0.059\n0.753\n0.082\n0.907\n0.101\n1.004\n0.107\n1.115\n0.121\n1.258\n0.140\n1.573\n0.561\n\nTable 7: Results of several simulations to test the validity and robustness of our statistical correction.
