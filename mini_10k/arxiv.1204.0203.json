Introduction\nCentral mass concentrations (CMCs) are frequently found\nin galaxies of all types, such as barred, spiral, disk or elliptical\ngalaxies. A few examples of CMCs are:\n1. Large condensations of molecular gas with scales of 0.1\n\u223c 2kpc and masses of 107 \u223c 109 M are found in the central\nregions (e.g., Ohta, et al., 1996; Sakamoto et al., 1999; Regan\net al., 2001). They are particularly evident in barred galaxies,\nwhere they are believed to be created by bar-driven inflow (e.g.,\nAthanassoula, 1992; Heller & Shlosman, 1994). The contribution of gas in the galactic evolution is a very important parameter. The reader can find interesting information about the role\nof the gas in the review of Kormendy & Kennicutt (2004) and\nreferences therein.\n2. Today it is widely accepted that most, if not all, of the\ngalaxies have in their cores super-massive black holes (SMBHs).\n\u2217 Corresponding author:\nE-mail address: evzotos@astro.auth.gr (Euaggelos E. Zotos)\n\nPublished in New Astronomy\n\nCentral supermassive black holes seem to be a ubiquitous component in spiral disk galaxies, as well as in elliptical galaxies.\nTypical masses are in the range of 106 \u223c 109 M (e.g., Young,\n1980, Turner, 1991; Magorrian et al., 1998; Ferrarese & Merritt, 2000; Gebhardt et al., 2000; McLure & Dunlop, 2001;\nTremaine et al., 2002; Wada & Norman, 2002; Kawakatsu &\nUmemura, 2002; Hopkins, et al., 2006; Shen, et al., 2008). The\nreader can find more details regarding SMBHs in the review of\nKormendy & Richstone, 1995.\n3. Dense star clusters are found near the centers of many\nspiral galaxies (Carollo, 2004; Walcher et al., 2003); these are\nyoung, very compact (a few to up to 20 pc), and relatively massive (106 \u223c 108 M ).\nFor the purposes of this study, a CMC is a sufficiently large\nmass at the center of a galaxy that is likely to have a dynamical\neffect on the evolution of its host galaxy. In other words, we\nfocus on the dynamical consequences of a dense and massive\nnucleus.\nDynamic searches indicate the presence of massive objects\nNovember 14, 2018\n\n\fin the central regions of most galaxies. (e.g., M31, M87 and\nNGC 4594). The estimation regarding the mass of the central region range from 106 M up to about 1010 M . Improved\nground-based instruments and especially the Hubble Space Telescope (H.S.T), have given interesting information about the central regions of the galaxies. Dynamical evidence for the presence of a massive object in the core of a galaxy, is based on\nthe value of the mass-to-luminosity ratio M/L. If this ratio increases towards the galactic center to values that are several\ntimes larger than normal, then this strongly indicates that a massive object has been discovered (Kormendy & Rihstone, 1995).\nRapid rotation is also a strong indication for the presence of a\nmassive object in the core of a galaxy (Miyoshi et al., 1995;\nGreenhill et al., 1997; Rubin et al., 1997; Bertola et al., 1998;\nSofue et al., 1999).\nThe effect of a central mass concentration (CMC) on the\nphase space in global galactic models has already been studied\nextensively in several earlier research works. Hasan & Norman (1990) have shown that a black hole or a CMC in a barred\ngalaxy can dissolve the barred structure. Moreover, the fundamental orbits of the system (called B orbits), supporting the bar\nare orbits elongated in the direction of the bar. As the black\nhole's mass increases, an inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) appears and moves outward. Thus, the B orbits disappear when\nthe ILR reaches the end of the bar. This effect is significantly\nincreased, if the bar is thinner. Orbits that stay closer to the\ncentral mass, with smaller Jacobi constants, can change their\ncharacter from regular to chaotic more easily. Furthermore, the\nstudy of Hasan et al. (1993) indicates that, as the mass of the\nCMC increases the stable regular orbits in the region where the\nbar potential competes in strength with the central mass potential, especially around the region of the ILR will be no longer\npresent and their position will be occupied by chaotic orbits.\nShen & Sellwood (2004) have conducted a systematic study of\nthe effects of CMC on bars, using high quality N-body simulations. They have experimented with both strong and weak\ninitial bars and a wide range of the physical parameters of the\nCMC, such as the final mass, the scale length and the mass\ngrowth time. Their outcomes suggest that, for a given mass\ncompact CMCs (such as super-massive black holes) are more\ndestructive to barred structures than are more diffuse ones (such\nas molecular gas clouds in many galactic centers). They have\nshown that the former are more efficient scatters of bars supporting regulars elongated orbits, that pass close to the galactic\ncenter and therefore, decrease the percentage of the the regular\norbits and increase the area of the chaotic region in the phase\nspace. All the above outcomes strongly indicate that a massive nucleus in the central parts of a galaxy, is a very important\nparameter of the dynamical system.\nIn several previous works, we see that low angular momentum stars in galaxies with massive nuclei, are scattered to much\nhigher scale heights, displaying chaotic motion (see Caranicolas, 1997, Karanis & Caranicolas, 2001; Caranicolas & Zotos,\n2010; Zotos, 2011a,b). All the above studies, not only describe\nthe chaotic character of orbits of low angular momentum stars,\nbut also provide the main reason which is responsible for this\nbehavior. The reason is the presence of the strong force, which\n\ncomes from the massive nucleus which resides in the core of\nthe galaxy. The dynamical models, used in all previous papers\nwere global models. In Caranicolas (1997), it was used the\nmass model introduced by Carlberg & Innanen (1987), while\nin Karanis & Caranicolas (2001) they have used a logarithmic\npotential. The most characteristic result, derived in all cases,\nwas the linear dependence of the critical value of angular momentum Lzc and the mass of the nucleus Mn . From our point of\nview, the background of this series of paper, in combination of\nother orbit calculations, was that managed to find and present,\nboth numerically and semi-theoretically, relationships connecting the involved physical parameters of the dynamical system,\nsuch as the angular momentum and the degree of chaos in disk\ngalaxies.\nRecently, Caranicolas & Zotos (2011) used a model consisting of two components. The first component was a logarithmic\npotential describing a prolate elliptical galaxy, while the second\none was a potential of a dense spherical nucleus. Two different\ncases were studied. The case when the nucleus is absent and\nthe case were we have an active galaxy hosting a dense and\nmassive nucleus. The main outcome of this work is that low\nangular momentum stars on approaching a dense and massive\nnucleus are deflected to higher values of z displaying chaotic\nmotion. This suggests that it is the strong vertical force near the\ndense nucleus that is the main responsible for this scattering,\ncombined with the star's low angular momentum which allows\nthe star to approach sufficiently enough to the dense nucleus in\norder to be deflected.\nIn an earlier work, Caranicolas & Papadopoulos (2003) adopted\na simple time dependent model in order to study the transition from regularity to chaos in a galaxy, when mass is transported exponentially from the disk to the galactic core forming\na dense and massive nucleus. The results of this research suggest that during the galactic evolution, low angular momentum\nstars change their orbital character from regular to chaotic. In\nthe present work, we will continue this study in more detail.\nIn particular, we shall deploy this gravitational galactic model,\nin order to investigate the change of the orbital nature for stars\nmoving in the meridian (r, z) plane. We will prove using a systematic and detailed study, that stars do not only change their\nnature from regular to chaotic during the galactic evolution, but\nthere are also stars which maintain their character and also a\nsmall portion of stars that alter their character from chaotic to\nregular.\nThe purpose of this research work is: (1) to find the correlations between the involved parameters of the system, (2) to\nexplain the numerically obtained results using theoretical arguments, (3) to compare the critical value of the angular momentum Lzc with the value of the circular angular momentum Lz0 at\ndifferent distances from the center of the galaxy and (4) to study\nthe evolution of orbits when mass is transported exponentially\nfrom the disk to the nucleus.\nThe present article is organized as follows: In Section 2\nwe present our gravitational dynamical model. In Section 3 we\nprovide a detailed analysis of the structure of our time independent dynamical system. Moreover, some interesting numerical\nresults are also provided in the same Section. In Section 4 we\n2\n\n\fpresent some semi-theoretical arguments, in order to support\nand explain our numerically obtained outcomes. In the next\nSection we follow the evolution of the orbits in the time dependent model, when mass is transported from the disk to the\nnucleus. We conclude with Section 6, where the discussion and\nthe conclusions of this research are presented.\n\n25\n20\n\n\u0398\n\n15\n10\n\n2. The dynamical model\n\n5\n\nA very convenient method in order to study the behavior of\nthe orbits of the stars in a galaxy, is to represent the galactic\nsystem by using a dynamical model, having about the same dynamical properties as the galaxy. In the present article, we shall\nstudy the transition from regular to chaotic motion, in an axially\nsymmetric galaxy described by the disk-halo potential\n\u03a6d (r, z) = \u2212\n\nMd\n,\nRd\n\n0\n0\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nFigure 1: The rotation curve of the galactic model is shown as the black line.\nThe red line is the contribution from the spherical nucleus, while the blue line\nis the contribution from the disk-halo potential.\n\n(1)\n\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f92\n3\nq\nX\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\n2\n\uf8ef\n= b + r + \uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0\u03b1 +\n\u03b2i hi + z2 \uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb ,\n2\n\n10\nr\n\nunit of time is 0.997748 \u00d7 108 yr. The unit of the angular momentum is 10 km kpc/s. The velocity unit and the energy unit\n(per unit mass) are 10 km/s and 100 (km/s)2 respectively, while\nG is equal to unity. In these units, we use the values: Md =\n12000, \u03b1 = 3 (kpc), b = 8 (kpc), (\u03b21 , \u03b22 , \u03b23 ) = (0.4, 0.5, 0.1)\nand (h1 , h2 , h3 ) = (0.325, 0.090, 0.125) kpc, while the mass and\nthe scale length of the nucleus are treated as parameters. The\nabove numerical values of the constant dynamical quantities of\nthe system, secure positive density everywhere and free of singularities.\nThe rotation curve of the galactic model when Mn = 400\nand cn = 0.25, is shown as the black line in Figure 1. In the\nsame plot, the red line is the contribution from the spherical\nnucleus, while the blue line is the contribution from the diskhalo component. We observe, that at small distances from the\ngalactic center r \u2264 2 kpc, dominates the contribution from the\nspherical nucleus, while at larger distances r > 2 kpc the diskhalo contribution is the dominant factor.\nIt would be very useful to compute the galactic mass density\n\u03c1(r, z) derived from the total potential (4), using the Poisson's\nequation\n\nwith\nR2d\n\n5\n\n2\n\n(2)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere (r, z) are the usual cylindrical coordinates. Here Md is\nthe mass of the disk, \u03b1 is the scale length of the disk, h corresponds to the disk scale height, while b is the core radius scale\nlength of the halo component. The three components of the disk\n(\u03b21 , \u03b22 , \u03b23 ), represent the fractional portions of old disk (Population II stellar objects), dark matter and young disk (Population\nI stellar objects), respectively (see Clutton-Brock et al., 1977;\nCarlberg & Innanen, 1987; Caranicolas & Innanen, 1991). The\nsymbol \u03a3 denotes summation over these three components and\nalso should apply that \u03b21 + \u03b22 + \u03b23 = 1. At this point,we should\nexplain the role of the dark matter halo, since it is the dominant\nmass at large radii, where stars are deflected to larger apocenter\nupon interacting with the dark halo component. The \u03b22 component represents the dark matter. In the present research for\nall our orbital calculations the distance from the galactic center\ndoes not exceeds 10kpc. Therefore, we do not study the nature\nof orbits at large radii at which the dark matter is the dominant\nmass.\nTo potential (1) we add a spherically symmetric nucleus\nMn\n\n\u03a6n (r, z) = \u2212 p\n,\nr2 + z2 + c2n\n\n1 2\n\u2207 \u03a6tot (r, z) =\n4\u03c0G\n\" 2\n#\n\u2202\n1 \u22022\n1\n1 \u2202\n\u22022\n+\n=\n+\n+\n\u03a6tot (r, z) .\n4\u03c0G \u2202r2 r \u2202r r2 \u2202\u03c62 \u2202z2\n\u03c1(r, z) =\n\n(3)\n\nRemember that due to the axial symmetry the third term in Eq.\n(5) is zero. Figure 2a shows the contours \u03c1(r, z) = const, for our\nmodel. The values of the contours are: (0.010, 0.017, 0.030,\n0.052, 0.150). In Figure 2b, we see a 3D plot of the values\nof the density \u03c1(r, z) on the r \u2212 z plane. We can observe the\nspherical nucleus at the central region of the galaxy and also\nthe well formed disk structure. This plot assures that the mass\ndensity has positive value everywhere. For large values of r and\nz the mass density varies like 1/r5 and 1/z5 respectively. This\nmeans that the total mass M(R), enclosed in a sphere of radius\nR increases linearly with distance. This explains why circular\nvelocity profiles, shown in Fig. 1 remains almost flat for large\nvalues of r. Here we must point out, that our gravitational po-\n\nwhere Mn is the mass and cn represents the scale length of the\nnucleus. The Plummer sphere we use in order to increase the\ncentral mass, has been applied many times in the past, in order\nto study the effect of the introduction of a central mass component in a galaxy (see Hasan and Norman, 1990; Hasan et al.,\n1993).\nThus, the total potential is\n\u03a6tot (r, z) = \u03a6d (r, z) + \u03a6n (r, z) .\n\n(5)\n\n(4)\n\nIn this research, we use a system of galactic units, where the\nunit of mass is 2.325 \u00d7 107 M , the unit of length is 1kpc and the\n3\n\n\f20\n\nz\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0.1\n0.08\n\u03a1Hr,zL 0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n0\n-20\n\n-10\n\n20\n10\n0 z\n-10\n-10\n\n0\nr\n\n-20\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\nr\n\n10\n\n10\n20\n\n20\n\n-20\n\nFigure 2: (a-b): (a-left): Density contours for our galactic model and (b-right): A 3D plot of the value of the mass density \u03c1 on the r \u2212 z plane.

The value of the energy integral is E = \u2212950 and remains constant during this section. The\nparticular value of the energy was chosen so that in all cases\nrmax ' 10 and also in order to keep the initial radial and vertical\nvelocities less than 55 km/s. Our numerical experiments indicate that the relationship between Lzc and Mn is nearly a straight\nline in every case (different values of cn ). Each line divides the\n\u0002\n\u0003\nLzc \u2212 Mn plane in two parts. Orbits with initial values of the\nparameters Lz and Mn on the upper left hand side part of the\ndiagram, including the line, are chaotic orbits, while orbits with\nstarting conditions on the lower right part of the same diagram\nare regular orbits. Note that, for small values of the the angular momentum, the slope of the line is different. Moreover, it\nis interesting to point out that the extent of the area regarding\nchaotic motion, increases as the value of cn becomes smaller,\nthat is when we have a more dense nucleus. We shall come to\nthat point later in the next section.\nIn order to study the regular or chaotic nature of the orbits,\nwe shall use the classical method of the (r, pr ), z = 0, pz > 0\nPoincar\u00e9 surface of section technique, where pr and pz are the\nradial and the vertical momenta respectively. If we set z =\npz = 0 in equation (8), we obtain the limiting curve in the\n(r, pr ) phase plane, which is the curve containing all the invariant curves, for a given value of the energy integral E. The\nlimiting curve of the dynamical system corresponds to\n1 2\np + \u03a6e f f (r) = E .\n2 r\n\n80\n\nLz = 1\nL z = 10\nL z = 20\n\n60\nA%\n\nL z = 30\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n100\n\n200\n\n300\nMn\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\nFigure 9: A plot of the relation between the percentage of the area A% in the\n(r, pr ) phase planes covered by chaotic orbits and the mass of the nucleus Mn .\n\nLz = 1\n\n< L.C.E >\n\n0.6\n\nL z = 10\nL z = 20\n\n0.4\n\nL z = 30\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n(11)\n\n100\n\nFigure 4a shows the (r, pr ) phase plane when Lz = 1, Mn =\n100 and cn = 0.25. As we see the majority of the phase plane\nis covered by chaotic orbits. Regular orbits are confined mainly\nnear the central part of the phase plane. There are also several\nsmaller islands embedded in the chaotic sea, which produced\nby secondary resonances. Figure 4b shows the (r, pr ) phase\nplane when Lz = 1, Mn = 400 and cn = 0.25. In this case,\nwhere the nucleus is more massive, the extent of the chaotic\nregion is larger, while the resonant phenomena are confined.\nMoreover, we observe that we have an increase in the radial velocity of the stars near the center of the galaxy. In Figure 5a\nwe see the (r, pr ) phase plane when Lz = 10, Mn = 100 and\ncn = 0.25. Here things are very different, since the majority\nof phase plane is covered by regular orbits now. Nevertheless\na considerable chaotic area is present but it is confined mainly\nin the outer parts of the phase plane. Furthermore, we observe\nthat the entire phase plane contains many sets of islands, which\ncorrespond to resonant orbits of higher multiplicity. In Figure\n5b one can see the (r, pr ) phase plane when Lz = 10, Mn = 400\nand cn = 0.25. The main difference from Fig. 5a is that now the\nnucleus is more massive and the small chaotic area of Fig. 5a\nhas become a vast chaotic sea. Furthermore, many of the sets of\nislands of invariant curves shown in Fig. 5a disappeared. Figure 6a shows the (r, pr ) phase plane when Lz = 20, Mn = 100\nand cn = 0.25. We observe that the extent of the chaotic orbits\nhas been decreased drastically as the value of the angular momentum increases. On the contrary, from the (r, pr ) phase plane\nshown in Figure 6b when Lz = 20, Mn = 400 and cn = 0.25,\nit is evident that the increase in mass of the nucleus leads to an\n\n200\n\n300\nMn\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\nFigure 10: A plot of the relation between the average value of the L.C.E and\nthe mass of the nucleus Mn .\n\nincrease of the chaotic region. We shall come to that later in\nthis section. In Figure 7a we see the (r, pr ) phase plane when\nLz = 30, Mn = 100 and cn = 0.25. We observe that the entire\nphase plane is covered only by regular orbits. This is logical\nbecause the value Lz = 30 of the angular momentum is larger\nthan the critical value Lzc = 28 (see Fig. 3). Figure 7b shows\nthe (r, pr ) phase plane when Lz = 30, Mn = 400 and cn = 0.25.\nAs expected the increase of the mass of the nucleus has introduced chaotic areas in the (r, pr ) phase plane. In all (r, pr ) phase\nplanes the value of the energy integral is the same and equals to\nE = \u2212950.\nWe observe from Figs. 4-7, that the extent of the chaotic\nregions in the phase plane increases as the nucleus becomes\nmore massive. On the other hand, as we increase the value of\nthe angular momentum Lz , the chaotic regions become smaller.\nTherefore, we conclude that the portion of chaotic orbits with\nlow or high values of angular momentum, in disk galaxies is\nlarger when a massive and dense nucleus is present. Here we\nmust notice that the whole area of the (r, pr ) phase plane is\nreduced and becomes smaller as Lz increases. The outermost\nsolid curve in the (r, pr ) phase planes shown in Figs. 4-7 is the\nlimiting curve.\nFigure 8a-h shows eight representative orbits of the dynamical system.

The initial conditions and the values of all the parameters are given in the text.\n\nwhen Lz = 1, Mn = 100, cn = 0.25. The initial conditions are:\nr0 = 0.94, z0 = 0, pr0 = 0. The value of pz0 is found always\nfrom the energy integral (8) for all orbits, while the energy integral has a constant value, which is E = \u2212950. In Figure 8b we\nsee a periodic orbit, which is characteristic of the 2:1 resonance.\nFor this orbit we have Lz = 10, Mn = 100, cn = 0.25, while the\ninitial conditions are: r0 = 4.78, z0 = 0, pr0 = 20.7. This orbit\ncarries stars out of the galactic plane. Figure 8c shows a periodic orbit of the 2:3 resonance, when Lz = 10, Mn = 100, cn =\n0.25. The initial conditions are: r0 = 9.164, z0 = 0, pr0 = 0.\nIn Figure 8d one observes a periodic orbit when Lz = 10, Mn =\n100, cn = 0.25, with initial conditions: r0 = 1.54, z0 = 0, pr0 =\n13.25. Figure 8e shows a periodic orbit which is characteristic of the 4:3 resonance. Here Lz = 1, Mn = 100, cn = 0, 25,\nwhile the initial conditions are: r0 = 7.61, z0 = 0, pr0 = 0. In\n\nFigure 8f a periodic orbit of the 3:5 resonance family is shown.\nIn this case we have Lz = 10, Mn = 100, cn = 0.25 and the\ninitial conditions are: r0 = 8.455, z0 = 0, pr0 = 0. Figure 8g depicts a complicated periodic orbit of higher multiplicity. Here\nLz = 10, Mn = 100, cn = 0.25, while the initial conditions are:\nr0 = 0.476, z0 = 0, pr0 = 0. A chaotic orbit is shown in Figure\n8h, when Lz = 1, Mn = 400, cn = 0.25 and the initial conditions are: r0 = 9.85, z0 = 0, pr0 = 0. Note that stars moving\nin chaotic orbit as this shown in Fig. 8h, are scattered to the\nhalo when approaching the massive nucleus. All orbits were\ncalculated for a time period of 100 time units. We can observe\nthat the periodic orbits shown in Figs. 8c, 8e, 8f and 8g stay\nrelatively close to the galactic plane and therefore, the corresponding families of regular orbits, support the disk structure\nof the galaxy.\n7\n\n\fFigure 9 shows the percentage of the area A% covered by\nchaotic orbits in the (r, pr ) phase planes as a function of the\nmass of the nucleus Mn , for four different values of the angular\nmomentum Lz . We observe that the percentage A% increases\nas the mass of the nucleus Mn increases in four cases. We must\npoint out that from this diagram we can extract very useful information. In particular, low angular momentum stars, display\nstrong chaotic behavior. Moreover, as we increase the value of\nthe angular momentum, the increase of the chaotic percentage,\nas the nucleus gaining mass becoming more massive, is more\nintense. It seems that when the nucleus is massive enough,\nMn \u2265 500, the value of the angular momentum cannot affect\nthe nature of the orbits due to the fact that Mn is the dominant\nparameter now. We see in Fig. 9 that all four fitting curves,\nwhich correspond to the four different values of the Lz , converge when Mn \u2265 500. We must point out, that the percentage\nA% is calculated as follows: we choose 1000 orbits with different and random initial conditions (r0 , pr0 ) in each phase plane\nand then divide the number of those who produce chaotic orbits\nto the total number of orbits.\nIn Figure 10 we see a plot of the average value of the Lyapunov Characteristic Exponent - L.C.E (see Lichtenberg and\nLieberman, 1992) as a function of the mass of the nucleus Mn ,\nfor four different values of the angular momentum Lz . We can\nobserve that the < L.C.E > increases linearly, as the mass of\nhe nucleus Mn increases in four cases. Furthermore, we see\nthat the fitting curves are almost parallel lines. We conclude,\nthat the degree of chaos increases linearly as the mass of the\nnucleus increases. In addition, low angular momentum stars\ndisplay larger degree of chaoticity than high angular momentum stars for the same mass of the nucleus. We shall try to\nexplain these results in the next section. Here we must notice,\nthat it is well known that the value of L.C.E is different in each\nchaotic component (see Saito & Ichimura, 1979). As we have\nin all cases regular regions and only one unified chaotic region\nin each (r, pr ) phase plane, we calculate the average value of\nL.C.E by taking 500 orbits with different and random initial\nconditions (r0 , pr0 ) in the chaotic region in each case. Note that,\nall calculated L.C.Es were different on the fifth decimal point in\nthe same chaotic region.\n\n1200\n1000\n\u00c8 Fz \u00c8\n\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nz\nFigure 11: A semi theoretical plot of the relation between |Fz | and Mn .

Only when z \u2265 2.4\nkpc the |Fzd | component becomes the dominant vertical force.\nFurthermore, it is the nuclear force that causes the scattering\nto the halo leading to chaotic motion. In fact, on approaching\nthe nucleus. there is a change in the star's momentum in the z\ndirection, given by\nm\u2206\u03c5z =< Fz > \u2206t ,\n\n4. A semi-theoretical approach\n\n(12)\n\nwhere m is the mass of the star, < Fz > is the total (i.e., nuclear)\naverage z force, while \u2206t is the duration of the encounter. It was\nobserved, that the star's deflection into the halo, proceeds in\neach case cumulatively, a little more with each successive pass\nby the nucleus, rather than with a single \"dramatic\" encounter.\nIt is assumed, that the star is scattered off the galactic plane\nand goes to the halo, after n (n > 1) encounters, when the total\nchange in the momentum in the z direction, is of order of m\u03c5\u03c6 ,\nwhere \u03c5\u03c6 = Lz /r, is the tangential velocity of the star near the\nnuclear region. Therefore, we shall assume that\n\nIn the present Section, we shall present some semi-theoretical\narguments, together with elementary numerical calculations, in\norder to explain the numerically obtained relationships, given\nin Figs. 3, 9 and 10. In order to explain the results shown in\nFig. 3, we use a mathematical analysis, similar to that used in\nZotos (2011a,b). Our numerical simulations indicate that, near\nthe nucleus, the Fz force component is dominant (it is approximately 20 times grater than at r = 8.5 kpc, for the same value\nof z) and in fact in nearly equal to that produced by the nucleus\nitself. The total |Fzt | force when Mn = 400 and cn = 0.25, is\nshown as the black line in Figure 11. In the same plot, the red\nline is the contribution from the spherical nucleus, |Fzn |, while\nthe blue line is the contribution from the disk-halo component,\n|Fzd |.

As the scattering of the stars occurs near the nucleus, it must be at r < 1 and z < 1. The particular values of r\nand z are irrelevant. In this case, we choose: r = r0 = cn = 0.25\nkpc and z = z0 = 0.10 kpc. We observe that |Fzn | increases\nlinearly with Mn , in all cases. One can see, that the pattern between Fzn and the mass of the nucleus (shown in Fig. 12), is\nsimilar to those between the chaotic percentage A% or the average value of the L.C.E and the mass of the nucleus Mn (shown\nin Figs. 9 and 10 respectively), which have been obtained numerically. In both cases numerical outcomes suggest that, as the\nvalue of the mass of the nucleus Mn increases, the percentage\nand also the degree of chaos in the dynamical system increases\nas well. Numerically found relationships given in Figs. 9 and\n10 can be explained because, as we have said earlier, the Fzn\nforce is the main contributor, to the chaotic motion observed\nin the (r, pr ) phase planes of the dynamical system. Moreover,\nfrom Fig. 12 one can conclude that when the scale length of the\nnucleus cn is smaller, that is when the nucleus is more dense,\nthe Fzn force is stronger, for each particular value of the mass\nof the nucleus Mn .\nA large number of orbits were computed, using different\nstaring distances from the center of the galaxy, with the same\nlow values of the initial radial and vertical velocities as was\nmentioned before. Orbits starting at the same distance r, are\nconsidered to belong to the same group. We have chosen this\nmethod of approach because the alternative, a self-consistent\ntreatment with the energy as an additional parameter, in a scattering setting and in a galactic potential, is beyond the scope of\nthe present paper. Some of these ideas may indeed be incorporated into a future work. Our numerical results suggest that, for\neach group of orbits, there is a linear relationship between Lzc\nand Mn , similar to that shown in Fig. 3.\nIt is also of interest to compare the critical angular momentum Lzc with the circular angular momentum Lz0 . The circular\nangular momentum is given by the equation\n\uf8f91/2\n\uf8ee\n!\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef 3 \u2202\u03a6t\n.\n(19)\nLz0 = \uf8f0\uf8efr0\n\uf8fb\uf8fa\n\u2202r r=r0 ,z=0\n\n= Te,\n\ni=1\n\n< Fz >\nm\nm\n\nMn z\n\u2202\u03a6n (r, z)\n=\u2212\n.\n\u0001\n2\n\u2202z\nr + z2 + c2n 3/2\n\n(15)\n\nInitially, if \u03c5z \u2265 \u03c5\u03c6 the orbit is chaotic. Otherwise, \u03c5z \u001c \u03c5\u03c6\nand after successive encounters with the galactic center, \u03c5z will\nincrease, until it reaches \u03c5\u03c6 . Then the orbit will be chaotic. The\ntime needed to reach the condition \u03c5z > \u03c5\u03c6 is T > T e , where\nT e is the sum of the encounter durations (14). Let T f be the\nage of the galaxy, which corresponds here to the final time of\nnumerical integrations. If T e > T f , then some stars do not have\nenough time to be scattered. We conclude from Eq. (15), that\nif Lz > Lzc , where Lzc is the angular momentum computed with\nT e = T f , then there is still exist non-chaotic motions. Whereas\nfor Lz < Lzc , all stars may have time to deploy chaotic motions.\nFor a given value of r0 (the particular value is irrelevant\nas soon as r0 is of order of unity), the quantitative behavior\nof |Fz | force is shown in Fig. 11. For small values of z, Fz\nbehaves as a harmonic oscillator force, while for larger values\nof z, falls as Mn /z3/2 . Expanding the potential of the nucleus\naround the point P (r = r0 , z = 0), the square of the frequency\n\u00113/2\n\u0010\nof the harmonic motion in the z direction is Mn / r02 + c2n .\nSubstituting the harmonic motion law in Eq. (15) with r = r0 =\nz = cn , we find\n\u221a\nMn \u2248 2cn Lzc 2/T ea ,\n(16)\nwhere, for convenience, we have written T ea instead of T e . If\nwe set < Fz >= Mn /z3/2 , r = cn , z = kcn (k \u2265 2) into Eq. (15),\nwe obtain\np\nMn \u2248 Lzc cn k3 /T e .\n(17)\nEquations (16) and (17) are very simplistic, but nevertheless, reproduce the observed linear relationship between Lzc and\nMn , which is shown in Fig. 3. Relation (17) also explains the\ndependence of the slope on the scale length of nucleus cn . The\nlarger is the cn the higher is the slope. This is because T e is\nobserved to be the about the same for the same scale length of\nthe nucleus. On the other hand, when Lzc is very small, the star\ngoes much closer to the nucleus, so that relation (16) must be\nused. Note that for the nucleus we always have cn < 1 and because of the smaller mass of the nucleus T ea > T e . Therefore, a\nlower slope results for the line in the region of very low angular\nmomenta or, what is equivalent, for very low nuclear masses\n(see Fig. 3).\n\nSuch a comparison, for five values of the mass of the nucleus,\nwhen cn = 0.25 kpc, is given in Table 1. Orbits start at three\ndifferent distances from the galactic center and according to the\nabove, belong to three groups of orbits. It is important to observe, that the ratio Lzc /Lz0 increases with decreasing r. This\nmeans that more stars (initially in the plane) are leaving the\ngalactic plane resulting from chaos in the central region, than\nfor larger values of r. This phenomenon could be taken as a first\nstep for the explanation of the existence of a chaotic bulge in\nmost disk-shaped galaxies, or perhaps, the presence of chaotic\norbits \"contaminating\" some more conventional stellar dynamical bulge.\n9\n\n\fTable 1: A comparison between Lzc and Lz0 for different distances from the\ngalactic center.\n\nMn\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n\nr = 2.5\nLz0 Lzc /Lz0\n30 0.516\n34 0.558\n37 0.648\n40 0.693\n43 0.739\n\nLzc\n15\n19\n24\n28\n32\n\nr = 5.0\nLzc Lz0 Lzc /Lz0\n27 90 0.300\n36 93 0.388\n45 95 0.472\n53 98 0.546\n62 100 0.617\n\nLzc\n28\n37\n46\n55\n64\n\nr = 8.5\nLz0 Lzc /Lz0\n190 0.147\n192 0.191\n195 0.236\n197 0.279\n200 0.321\n\n600\ncn = 0.50\n\n500\n\nM nf\n\n400\n\ncn = 0.25\n\ncn = 0.10\n\nChaotic Motion\n\n300\n200\n\nRegular Motion\n\n100\n0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\nL zc\n\n60\n\n80\n\nFigure 13: Relationship between the critical value of the angular momentum\nLzc and the final mass of the nucleus Mn f . Details are given in the text.\n\nL.C.E. The main advantage of this method is that it uses certain and objective numerical thresholds beyond which we can\ndistinguish between ordered and chaotic motion. On the other\nhand, this method is very time consuming, as it needs time intervals of numerical integration of order of 105 time units, in\norder to give reliable and definitive results regarding the nature\nof an orbit. But this is a \"price\" we can afford to pay.\nOur numerical calculations suggest that a linear relationship exists between Lzc and Mn f . This can be easily seen looking\nshown in Figure 13. Each line divides the\nh at the diagram\ni\nLzc \u2212 Mn f plane in two parts. Orbits with values of the physical parameters Lzc and Mn f on the upper left hand side of the\ndiagram, including the line, are chaotic, while orbits with initial\nconditions on the lower right hand side part of the same diagram\nare regular. Note that, for very small values of the angular momentum, the slope of the lines is different. In order to produce\nthis part of the diagram, we used small values of Mni and m. In\nall other cases we have used Mni > 100. One observes that this\ndiagram is very similar to the diagram given in Fig. 3, which\ncorresponds to the time independent model. Moreover, numerical calculations, not provided here, suggest that if we change\nthe value of the timescale factor k, the outcomes would be very\nsimilar again. Therefore, we may conclude that the mass transportation (itself or the time scale factor k) does not affect so\nmuch the correlation between Lzc and Mn .\nTable 2: The respective percentage of total tested orbits for different values of\nthe timescale k.\n\n5. Evolution of orbits in the time dependent model\n\nk\n0.001\n0.004\n0.04\n\nIn this Section, we shall study the evolution of orbits in our\ngalactic model, when mass transport is taking place. We assume\nthat mass is transported from the disk to the nucleus, in such\nas way, that we have an exponential increase in the mass of the\nnucleus, while an exponential decrease occurs in the mass of the\ndisk. The exponential mass transportation follows the equations\n\u0010\n\u0011\nMd f = Mdi \u2212 m 1 \u2212 e\u2212kt ,\n\u0010\n\u0011\nMn f = Mni + m 1 \u2212 e\u2212kt ,\n(20)\n\nR\u2192C\n56%\n58%\n61%\n\nC\u2192C\n25%\n24%\n26%\n\nR\u2192R\n16%\n14%\n11.8%\n\nC\u2192R\n3%\n4%\n1.2%\n\nFigure 14a-d shows the evolution of the Lyapunov Characteristic Exponent of four different orbits, as the total mass distribution of the dynamical system changes with time, following\nthe set of equations (20). For all orbits shown in Fig. 14ad, the initial value of the Hamiltonian (8) is Ei = \u2212950, while\nMni = 100, cn = 0.25, m = 300 and k = 0.004. In Figure 14a we\ncan see the evolution of the Lyapunov Characteristic Exponent\nfor an orbit and for a time period of 105 time units, as the galaxy\nevolves. The initial conditions are: r0 = 2.2, z0 = 0, pr0 = 0,\nwhile the value of pz0 is found from the Hamiltonian (8) in all\ncases. The value of the angular momentum is Lz = 1. When\nt = 1000 time units, the mass of the nucleus is Mn f = 400\nand the evolution stops. The value of the Hamiltonian is now\nE f = \u2212958. Note that the L.C.E tends asymptotically to zero,\nwhich clearly indicates that this orbit starts as regular and remains regular always near the galactic plane, during the galactic evolution. Figure 14b is similar to Fig. 14a. This orbit\nhas initial conditions: r0 = 8.65, z0 = 0, pr0 = 0, while the\nvalue of the angular momentum is Lz = 10. When t = 1000\ntime units, the final mass of the nucleus is Mn f = 400 and\nthe mass transportation stops. The value of the Hamiltonian\nis now E f = \u2212961. In this case, the profile of the L.C.E clearly\nindicates that this orbit starts as a chaotic orbit and remains\n\nwhere Mdi and Mni are the initial values of the mass of the disk\nand the nucleus respectively, m is the portion of the disk mass\nthat is transferred, t is the time, while k > 0 is a positive parameter, which determines the timescale of the evolution. This particular model of mass transportation was introduced in Caranicolas & Papadopoulos (2003). In our study, we will investigate\nin more detail this model. In particular, we will try to find out\nthe correlation, if any, between the critical value of the angular\nmomentum Lzc and the final mass of the nucleus Mn f . As final\nmass we consider the limit of the current mass Mn f , as t \u2192 \u221e.\nOrbits were started at r0 = 8.5, z0 = 0 with radial and\nvertical velocities smaller than 30 km/s, while k = 0.004 and\nm = 300. Due to the fact that the corresponding Hamiltonian\nis time dependent, it is not possible to use again the Poincar\u00e9\nsurface of section technique. It is well known, that the shape\nof orbits, sometimes is inconclusive or misleading. In order\nto overcome this drawback, we decided to use a highly accurate method, such as the Lyapunov Characteristic Exponent 10\n\n\fFigure 14: (a-d): Evolution of the L.C.E of four different orbits, following the set of Eqs. (20). By this procedure a massive nucleus is formed in the core of the\ngalaxy.

The blue line stand for k = 0.04, while the\nred one for k = 0.001. Details are given in the text.\n\nchaotic, during the galactic evolution. We can observe that as\nthe mass of the nucleus increases, during the mass transportation, the value of the L.C.E also increases gradually. Figure\n14c depicts the evolution of the L.C.E of an orbit with initial\nconditions: r0 = 8.47, z0 = 0, pr0 = 0. The value of the angular momentum is now Lz = 20. After a time interval of\n1000 time units the mass of the nucleus is Mn f = 400 and the\n\ngalactic evolution stops. The Hamiltonian settled to the value\nE f = \u2212959. The profile of the L.C.E given in Fig. 14c indicates\nthat this orbit stars as a chaotic orbit but after the mass transportation it becomes an ordered one. In Figure 14d we observe\nthe evolution of the L.C.E of an orbit with initial conditions:\nr0 = 8.8, z0 = 0, pr0 = 0, while the value of the angular momentum this time is Lz = 30 . After a time interval of 1000 time\n11\n\n\funits the final value of the mass of the nucleus is Mn f = 400 and\ntherefore, galactic evolution stops. The Hamiltonian settled to\nthe value E f = \u2212960. The profile of the L.C.E given in Fig. 14d\nshows that this orbit stars as a regular orbit but after the mass\ntransportation, it becomes a chaotic one. Therefore, it is evident\nthat if mass transport was not present, the orbit this time would\nhave remain regular. In this case, the presence of the massive\nnucleus in the core of galaxy, has changed the nature of the orbit, from regular to chaotic. Furthermore, one can say that we\nare dealing with the case of \"fast\" chaos, because the corresponding value of the L.C.E is relatively large (see for details\nin Caranicolas, 1990 and references therein).\nAs one would expect, the orbital evolution of stars in an\nevolving galactic model and the transition from regularity to\nchaos, should strongly depends on the timescale of the evolution, determined by the k parameter. In order to reveal the\nimportance of the timescale, we will explore several cases, in\nwhich the temporal evolution timescale is varied. Figure 15a\nshows the evolution of the L.C.E of the orbit with the same initial conditions as in Fig. 14c, for two different values of the\ntimescale k. The blue line stand for k = 0.04, while the red one\nfor k = 0.001. In both cases, the orbit starts as a chaotic but\nafter the mass transportation (t > 200 time units for the orbit\nshown in blue line and t > 4000 time units for the orbit shown\nin red line) the orbit becomes regular. Note that both lines seem\nto converge when t > 104 time units. Similar in Figure 15b,\nwe can see the the evolution of the L.C.E of the orbit with the\nsame initial conditions as in Fig. 14d, for two different values\nof the timescale k. Again, the blue line stand for k = 0.04,\nwhile the red one for k = 0.001. In both cases, the orbit starts\nas a regular but after the mass transportation (t > 200 time units\nfor the orbit shown in blue line and t > 4000 time units for the\norbit shown in red line) the orbit alters its nature and becomes\nchaotic. Note once more, that the values of the L.C.E converge\nwhen t > 4000 time units. One should be very careful because,\nfor small time intervals, a regular orbit may look chaotic and\nvise versa. This is due to the different values of the timescale\nk, which determines how fast the mass from the disk is transported to the nucleus. This phenomenon is observed only when\nthe galactic evolution (mass transportation) takes place. When\nthe galactic evolution stops and the system becomes time independent, the nature of the orbits is the same, regardless the\nparticular value of k we used. Thus, we reach to the conclusion\nthat the timescale itself, does not affect directly the nature of\nthe orbits during the galactic evolution. It only determines each\ntime, the time interval which is needed for an orbit during the\nmass transportation in order to form its final character (regular\nor chaotic).\nUsing the above procedure, we have computed and tested\na large number of orbits (approximately 3000 different initial\nconditions of orbits for three different values of the timescale k),\nwith different starting distances from the center of the galaxy,\nwhile keeping the corresponding radial and vertical velocities\nsmaller than 30 km/s. Orbits starting at the same distance r\nwere considered to belong to the same group. All numerical\noutcomes suggest that, for each group of orbits, a linear relationship exists, between the critical value of the angular mo-\n\nmentum Lzc and the final mass of the nucleus Mn f . Our numerical results indicate that the character of the orbits can change\neither from regular to chaotic and vise versa or not change at\nall, as the mass is transported and the massive nucleus is developed in the central region of the disk galaxy. Table 2 shows\nthe respective percentage of total tested orbits in each case. The\nsymbols R \u2192 C, C \u2192 C, R \u2192 R and C \u2192 R correspond to\neach kind of the alteration of the orbital nature (i.e. R \u2192 C\ncorresponds to Regular to Chaotic etc). From Table 2, it is evident that the formation of a massive nucleus, leads the majority\nof the orbits of the system to alter their nature from regular to\nchaotic or to stay chaotic. Some orbits maintain their regular\ncharacter but only a very small portion of the total tested orbits change their nature from chaotic to regular during the mass\ntransportation. This tiny portion of initial conditions belongs to\nresonant orbits of higher multiplicity which correspond to multiple small islands of invariant curves in the (r, pr ) phase plane.\nThese resonant orbits appear when the nucleus reaches its final\nvalue, that is Mn f = 400. Furthermore, we may conclude that\nthe particular value of the timescale k does not affect directly\nthe galactic evolution. The dominant parameter which determines the nature of an orbit is the final mass of the nucleus. The\ntimescale k, simply shows how fast the galactic nucleus would\nreach its final mass through the mass transportation. Whether\nthe nature of an orbit will change or not during the galactic evolution described by the set of equations (20), strongly depends\non the initial conditions (r0 , pr0 ) of each orbit. Moreover, as\nthe change of the value of the Hamiltonian (8) in each case is\npractically negligible, (\u2206E . 1.5%), we can say that the orbits\nin each group can be considered as isoenergetic.\n6. Discussion and conclusions\nIn the present paper, we used an axially symmetric galactic\ngravitational model with a disk-halo and a spherical nucleus, in\norder to investigate the transition from regular to chaotic motion for stars moving in the meridian (r, z) plane. We studied in\ndetail, the transition from ordered to chaotic motion, in two different cases: the time independent model and the time evolving\nmodel, when mass is transported from the disk to central nuclear region. In both cases, we explored all the available range\nregarding the values of the main involved parameters of the dynamical system and we obtained interesting results, regarding\nthe correlations between the important physical quantities of\nthe system.\nHere, we have to point out which of the outcomes of the\npresent study are novel. In this research we have used a composite disk-halo potential with an additional spherically symmetric nucleus, represented by a Plummer sphere. The current\npaper is basically consists of two parts. In the first part which\ncovers Sections 3 and 4, describes the time independent galactic\nmodel. He have conducted a thorough, detailed and systematic\nstudy in order to connect the involved parameters of the dynamical system. In particular we obtained the relationship which\nconnects the critical value of the angular momentum with the\nmass of the nucleus. Moreover, we connected the mass of the\nnucleus with the chaotic percentage and also with the average\n12\n\n\fvalue of the Lyapunov Characteristic Exponent, for several values if the angular momentum. All these numerically obtained\nrelationships, have been reproduced and verified using a semitheoretical approach. The second part of the present paper, that\nis Section 5, describes the time dependent model. Here, we\nadopted the simple model of mass transportation proposed by\nCaranicolas & Papadopoulos (2003), as a starting point. We\nstudied in much detail this model using three different values of\nthe timescale k of the galactic evolution. For each value of the k\nparameter, we computed 1000 different and random initial conditions (r0 , pr0 ). Our calculations suggest that the majority of\nthe orbits of the system alter their nature from regular to chaotic\nor remain chaotic. Some orbits maintain their regular character\nbut only a very small portion of the total tested orbits change\ntheir nature from chaotic to regular during the mass transportation. It was found, that the particular value of the timescale k\ndoes not affect directly the galactic evolution. It is only determines how fast the nucleus would reach its final value of the\nmass. The most significant revelation is that the dominant parameter, which determines whether an orbit would change or\nnot and how its orbital nature during the mass transportation, is\nthe final value of the mass of the nucleus.\nIt is evident that there is a well defined transition from regularity to chaos in our galactic model, for a given mass of the\ndisk-halo component. This transition is nearly a straight line\n\u0002\n\u0003\nconnecting the points in the Lzc \u2212 Mn plane. The slope of this\nline increases with the scale length of the nucleus cn . The physical interpretation of this result is that, a nucleus of the same\nmass but with greater concentration (smaller cn ), deflects stars\nwith higher values of angular momentum. It also evident that\nthe above straight line relation can be derived and reproduced\nusing elementary mathematical calculations. For this derivation, we have assumed that the deflection into a vertical chaotic\norbit, happens after n encounters with correlated deflections.\nThis choice was made by observing the behavior of the orbits\nin our numerical simulations and also by taking into account\nthe smoothness of the total Fz force (see Fig. 11).\nIn order to keep things simple, we have kept some of the\nparameters of the system constant and studied the behavior of\norbits varying only three basic parameters (Mn , cn , Lz ). It was\nfound that, there is a linear relationship between the average\nvalue of the L.C.E and the mass of the nucleus Mn . On the\ncontrary, the relation between the chaotic percentage A% on the\n(r, pr ) phase plane and the mass of the nucleus Mn is not linear\nbut rather exponential. The numerically found outcomes were\nexplained, using some semi-theoretical arguments. Moreover,\nwe concluded that when the scale length of the nucleus cn is\nsmaller, that is when the nucleus is more dense, the Fzn force\nis stronger, for each particular value of the mass of the nucleus\nMn and thus the chaoticity of the dynamical system increases.\nA comparison of the critical angular momentum Lzc to the\nlocal circular angular momentum Lz0 , reveals that the ratio Lzc /Lz0\nincreases as we approach the center of the galaxy. For a galaxy\nwith a nearly flat rotation curve, this variation mainly reflects\nthe variation of the galactocentric distance r. Therefore, stars\nmoving near the center can more easily be deflected to higher\nvalues of z. This could be connected with the presence of mas13\n\nsive spherical nuclei in the central regions of disk galaxies and\nsuggest that near such massive nuclei the nature of the orbits\nof the stars must be highly chaotic, i.e., with isotropic velocity dispersions. Our numerical experiments, show that near the\ncenter, the total Fz force is entirely due to the massive nucleus\nand behaves like that of a harmonic oscillator. This is a strong\nindication, that under certain conditions, the harmonic oscillator approximation can provide reliable results regarding the\nmotion in the central regions of real galaxies.\nToday, we know that the addition of matter onto compact\nobjects, such as massive and dense galactic nuclei, is a very\ncomplicated astrophysical mechanism, which it would be very\ndifficult to be studied and explored, if we do not establish some\nbasic assumptions in order to make it more maneuverable. In\nthe present research, we have studied the change in the nature\nof the orbits in a time-dependent model, with an exponential\nmass transport from the disk to the nuclear region. We have\nadopted this simple model, without going into more details for\ntwo basic reasons. The first reason is that as it was mentioned\nabove, it would be very difficult to construct a model in order\nto explain such a complicated mechanism and the second reason is that we are not interested in the astrophysical structure of\nthe galaxy, but only in its dynamical behavior. Here we have to\nclarify, that our simple time dependent model, may not necessarily reflect the actual astrophysical mechanism. Nevertheless,\nsimilar simple dynamical models have been used frequently in\nthe past (see Caranicolas & Papadopoulos, 2003; Caranicolas\n& Innanen, 2009) in order to study the dynamical behavior of\nstellar orbits in complicated galactic systems. Once more, we\nhave to point out that our current treatment of the system is\npurely dynamical. This is exactly the main scope of this article.\nIt is well known that such mechanisms are met in the central\nregions of active galaxies and they are responsible for the enormous luminosity of the quasars which are hosted in the cores of\nthe galaxies (see Collin & Zahn, 1999 and references therein).\nOur numerical calculations show that a linear relationship\nbetween the the critical value of the angular momentum Lzc and\nthe final mass of the nucleus Mn f also exists. Note, that the\nslope of this line increases as the value of the scale length of\nthe nucleus cn increases. This fact indicates that a nucleus of\nthe same mass but with larger concentration (smaller value of\nthe cn ) is able to deflect stars with greater values of the angular\nmomentum. Therefore, one can say that the present results are\nsimilar to those obtained in Zotos (2011b), where we have also\nconnected the involved parameters of the system with the extent\nof the chaotic regions and the angular momentum. In addition\nto the observed similarities, we have also observed some differences in the behavior of orbits, between this model and the\nmodel used by Zotos (2011a). The most important difference is\nthat in our previous work, the stars moved towards the halo after several encounters with the nucleus. Here stars can stay for\nlong time periods (this actually depends on the particular value\nof the timescale k, that is on how fast mass is transported from\nthe disk to the nucleus), before they scattered to the halo. Therefore, one must be very cautious because, for small time periods,\na chaotic orbit may look regular. It seems that, in this case, one\nis not able to use methods for fast detection of chaos, especially\n\n\fwhen small values of k are used (see Karanis & Caranicolas,\n2002 and references therein).\nGoing on step further into the physical interpretation of the\noutcomes of the present work, we can summarize the following: There is no doubt that a large number of galaxies show\nsignificant activity in their nuclear regions. We adopted a simple model, in order to express this activity, which is described\nby a mass transportation from the disk to the nuclear region.\nThe novelty and the aim of this research, is to explore on how\nthe dynamical properties of the galaxy, that is the behavior of\norbits, have been affected by the mass transfer phenomenon and\nalso to establish a relationship between two important physical\nquantities: the final mass of the nucleus and the star's angular\nmomentum. The physical conclusion is that in active galaxies,\na large number of low angular momentum stars display chaotic\nmotion. Furthermore, some orbits that may look regular, in fact\nmust be chaotic when the transportation of the mass is slow.\nThe general conclusion from our work is that the dominant parameters, which determine the nature of the orbits in galaxies\nare the mass of the nucleus and the angular momentum. The\nrest involved quantities do not affect directly the nature of the\norbits. In particular, as we have seen in the time dependent\nmodel, the timescale k does not really affect the final character\nof the orbits. It is in our future plans to try a different way of\nmass transportation (i.e a linear). From the present outcomes\nwe may foresee, until proven, that even a different kind of mass\ntransportation would not affect directly the nature of the orbits,\nsince as we have seen the dominant parameter is the final mass\nof the nucleus and not how (how fast or with which way) we\nreach this value.\n\n[18] Hasan, H., Norman, C.
