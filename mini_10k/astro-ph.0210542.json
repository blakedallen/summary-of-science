B. Tiepolo 11, 34131\nTrieste, Italy\nAbstract. We present a new model for the chemical evolution of elliptical galaxies\ntaking into account SN feedback, detailed nucleosynthesis and galactic winds. We\ndiscuss the effect of galactic winds on the chemical enrichment of the ICM and\ncompute the energy per particle injected by the galaxies into the ICM.\nKeywords: galaxies: evolution, clusters\n\n1. The chemical evolution model for Ellipticals\nWe present the results obtained with a new chemical evolution model\nfor ellipticals, based on the multi-zone model by Martinelli et al. (1998),\nwith improved SN feedback and different prescriptions for the stellar\nnucleosynthesis (see Pipino et al. 2002). This model can be applied\nto infer the age for a single galaxy (as MS1512-cB58, see Matteucci &\nPipino 2002), to test different scenarios for galaxy formation (i.e. monolithic versus hierarchical) and to predict the evolution of the chemical\nabundances and the energy per particle released by elliptical galaxies\nthrough galactic winds into the ICM.\n1.1. Galactic models\nWe adopt two different recipes for SNIa and SNII, respectively. For SNII\nwe assume that the evolution of the energy in the 'snowplow' phase is\nregulated by Cioffi, McKee & Bertschinger (1988) cooling time (for\na detailed discussion see Pipino et al. 2002). This cooling time takes\ninto account the effect of metallicity, and therefore can model in a\nself-consistent way the evolution of a SNR in the ISM.\nOn the other hand, following Recchi et al. (2001), we assume that\nSNIa, which explode in a medium already heated by SNII, contribute\nwith the total amount of their energy budget, without radiative losses.\nIn this way we obtain a total (i.e. SNIa+II) mean efficiency of energy\nrelease by SN to the ISM of \u223c 20% for our best model, and derive\na maximum possible efficiency (in order to have realistic models) of\nabout \u223c 35% .\nWe study the effects of two different sets of stellar yields on the\nenrichment of the ICM: a) For low and intermediate mass stars (0.8 \u2264\nc 2018 Kluwer Academic Publishers. Printed in the Netherlands.\n\npipino.tex; 13/09/2018; 22:40; p.1\n\n\f2\n\nPipino & Matteucci\n\nM/M\u2299 \u2264 8) the yields by Renzini and Voli (1981). For massive stars,\ntype II SNe (M > 10M\u2299 ) the yields by Woosley and Weaver (1995),\ntheir case B. b) For low and intermediate mass stars the yields by van\nden Hoek & Groenewegen (1997). For massive stars, type II SNe, the\nyields by Thielemann et al. (1996) In both cases we use the yields by\nNomoto et al. (1997) for SNIa.\nHere we present the results obtained with our best model: a multizone model with Salpeter IMF, and the choice a) for stellar yields. The\nadopted cosmology is \u03a9m = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7 and Ho = 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121\nand the galaxies form at zf = 8. In order to check our results we compared our prediction for the Fe enrichment of the ICM, with predictions\nfrom models with different prescriptions (see Pipino et al. 2002). Our\nmodels assume increasing efficiency of SF with galactic mass which\nmakes larger galaxies undergo galactic wind before the smaller ones.\nThis implies shorter star-formation timescales for more massive galaxies\nand allows us to reproduce the increasing trend of [Mg/Fe] with galactic\nmass (Matteucci 1994).\n1.2. The age of the galaxy MS1512-cB58\nWe can constrain the age of the Lyman break galaxy MS1512-cB58\n(showing that its chemical properties are consistent with those of an\nelliptical galaxy or a bulge in the early phases of its life, Matteucci &\nPipino 2002). In particular, we find that this age should be \u223c 30M yr\nby comparing our model predictions on the chemical abundances with\nthe observations of Pettini et al. (2002). In the first figure we show\nthe prediction for [X/Fe] vs. time (left panel), assuming that roughly\nhalf of the iron is hidden in dust grains, compared to the observations\n(showed as horizontal lines) with their errors. The right panel allows\nus to make a stronger conclusion on the age, because neither O nor N\nare dust depleted.\n\n2. Evolution of abundances and energy in the ICM\nTo compute the total masses of the chemical elements, gas and total\nthermal energy ejected into the ICM by the cluster galaxies we integrate the contributions from the single galaxies over the cluster K-band\nluminosity function at each given cosmic time for clusters of different\nmass (temperature). For the equations and related details we direct the\nreader to Pipino et al. (2002).\nIn figure 2 we show the Fe abundance in the ICM predicted by our\nmodels compared to the observed one by White (2000) as functions of\n\npipino.tex; 13/09/2018; 22:40; p.2\n\n\f3\n\nChemical evolution of Elliptical Galaxies and the ICM\nredshift\n-0.8\n0.5\n-1\n0\n\n-1.2\n\n-0.5\n\n-1.4\n\n-1\n\n-1.6\n-1.8\n\n0.8\n\n-2\n\n0.6\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0\n\n[O/H]\n\n0.4\n0.2\n\n-0.5\n\n0.7\n\n-1\n\n0.6\n\n-1.5\n\n0.5\n\n-2\n\n0.4\n-2.5\n\n0.3\n0.2\n7\n\n7.5\n\n8\n\n8.5\n\n-3\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\n\nFigure 1.\n\n0.04\n\n0.05\n\n0.06\n\ntime (Gyr)\n\nlog time (yr)\n\nEvolution of abundances and abundance ratios in the ISM for ellipticals of different initial\n\nmass.

Our best model (with Salpeter\nIMF and evolution of Spirals) is shown by the long dashed\nline. We have also computed the amount of metals which remains\nlocked up inside stars. We found that the Fe in the ICM should be\n5 times more than the Fe in stars, whereas O and the global metal\ncontent should be roughly the same inside stars and in the ICM.\n\npipino.tex; 13/09/2018; 22:40; p.3\n\n\f4\n\nPipino & Matteucci\n\nThe best model can also reproduce the observed [\u03b1/Fe] ratios in\nthe ICM. In particular, there is good agreement between the predicted\n(\u223c solar) and observed (\u223c 0.1 \u00b1 0.1dex) [Si/Fe] ratios, whereas the\npredicted [O/Fe] ratios are lower (\u223c \u22120.3dex) than the solar value,\nas indicated by some observations (e.g. Ishimaru & Arimoto 1997).\nHowever, the O measurements in the ICM are still very sparse and\nuncertain and more data are required to assess this point (but see\nGastaldello & Molendi 2002).\nModels with the choice b) for the stellar yields from massive stars\npredict the same amount of Fe and energy in the ICM, whereas the\ndifferences in the predictions for [\u03b1/Fe] ratios are less than \u223c 0.2dex.\nOn the right-hand side of figure 2 we show the predicted evolution\nof the energy per particle in the ICM, Epp (upper panel) and the iron\nmass in the ICM (lower panel) as a function of redshift by \"the best\nmodel\". Little evolution is found both for the abundances and for the\nheating energy from z=0 up to z=1, in agreement with observations\n(Matsumoto et al. 2000).\n3. Conclusions\nWhile type II SNe dominate the chemical evolution of the ellipticals\n(creating \u03b1 enhancement) , type Ia SNe play a fundamental role in\nproviding energy (\u223c 80 \u2212 95%) and Fe (\u223c 45 \u2212 80%) into the ICM.\nComparing masses and energy ejected by galaxies formed at z = 8\nwith those from galaxies formed at z \u223c 3 leads to the conclusion that\nthe bulk of the ejection has to take place at 3 < z < 5.\nThe best model, which reproduces the Fe abundances in the ICM,\ncan provide 0.20-0.35 keV of energy per ICM particle, depending on\nthe cluster richness.\nReferences\nArimoto, N., Yoshii, T. 1987, A&A, 173, 23\nCioffi, D.F. et al. 1988, ApJ, 334, 252\nGastaldello, F., Molendi, S. 2002, ApJ, 572, 160\nIshimaru, Y., Arimoto, N., 1997, PASJ, 49, 1\nMartinelli, A. et al. 1998, 2000, A&A, 354, 387\nMatsumoto, H. et al. 2000, PASJ, 52, 153\nMatteucci, F. 1994, A&A, 288, 57\nMatteucci, F., Pipino, A. 2002, Apj, 596, L6\nNomoto, K. et al. 1997, Nucl.
