[1].\nPACS numbers: 04.25.dg,04.20.-q,04.30.-w,04.20.Ex,04.25.-g\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nRecently, there has been increased interest in formulations for numerical relativity based on conformal compactification [2] in which the calculational grid extends to future null infinity (I + ), where the gravitational radiation\namplitude can be read off unambiguously, with at most numerical errors, and where no dynamical boundary conditions are necessary. In principle this can be done with Cauchy characteristic matching methods, but these have not\nbeen implemented successfully with non-trivial dynamics. Cauchy characteristic extraction methods can extrapolate\nfrom the outer boundary of a conventional Cauchy code to determine waveforms at I + , but do not eliminate errors\nin the Cauchy development deriving from inexact boundary conditions at a finite radius. The characteristic methods\nare reviewed by J. Winicour [3]. Our focus here is the initial value problem on hyperboloidal spacelike hypersurfaces,\nand specifically the case of constant mean extrinsic curvature (CMC) hypersurfaces [4\u20138]. The vanishing of the conformal factor \u03a9 at I + accounts for the singular behavior of the physical spacetime metric at I + in compactified\ncoordinates. The conformal geometry, in which I + is an ingoing null hypersurface, is regular in a neighborhood of\nI + , and a CMC hypersurface of the physical spacetime is spacelike in the conformal spacetime out to and including\nits intersection with I + , a 2-surface with spherical topology which we denote by I \u0307+ . Regularity conditions relating\nthe 2D extrinsic curvature of I \u0307 + as embedded in the CMC hypersurface to the conformal extrinsic curvature need to\nbe satisfied at I \u0307 + , but when imposed in the initial data are automatically preserved by the evolution equations [5, 8].\nThe constraint equations, given suitable gauge conditions, determine the leading behavior of the conformal factor and\nthe conformal extrinsic curvature of the hypersurface in the neighborhood of I + in terms of asymptotic gravitational\nwave amplitudes [9]. If the physical mean extrinsic curvature is not too large, the dynamics of the sources (black holes,\nneutron stars) takes place where the CMC hypersurfaces are not that different from the hypersurfaces of conventional\n3+1 methods.\nConformally flat initial data on CMC hypersurfaces were considered in Ref. [1]. The conformal momentum constraint\nequations have the same form as they do on maximal hypersurfaces, and with conformal flatness admit a class of\nanalytic solutions which are slight generalizations of the well-known Bowen-York solutions [10] often used for single or\nmultiple black hole initial data on maximal hypersurfaces. The Hamiltonian constraint provides an elliptic equation\nfor the conformal factor which is degenerate at I + . Despite this degeneracy, Ref. [1] obtained numerical solutions\nwithout much difficulty using the standard spectral elliptic solver of the Caltech-Cornell-CITA SpEC code [11, 12].\nThe degeneracy constrains the leading terms in the expansion of \u03a9 about I \u0307+ .\nAn essential part of the physical interpretation of these solutions is knowing precisely the total energy, linear\nmomentum, and angular momentum of the system as coded in the asymptotic behavior of the spacetime metric at\nI + . The standard Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) formulas [13] for these quantities only apply on asymptotically\nflat slices at spatial infinity. The Bondi-Sachs energy and momentum at I + [14, 15] are the relevant quantities for\nCMC hypersurfaces. Ref. [1] did not fully address this issue, making only some rather crude estimates of the total\nenergy, momentum, and angular momentum with limited validity and for the most part with uncertain errors.\nWhile there is an extensive literature dealing with the problem of extracting these global physical quantities near\nor at at future null infinity (see, e.g., the review [16]), part of which deals specifically with CMC hypersurfaces [17],\nwe see practical difficulties in implementing many of these procedures. Some of them require the choice of a reference\nspatial metric and extrinsic curvature. Determining the reference quantities with the precision necessary to obtain\nunambiguous results requires considerable effort, in general. Formulas based on the asymptotic behavior of the\n\n\f2\nWeyl tensor (e.g., [15, 18, 19]) can be useful computationally, but an analysis based on geometrically defined spatial\ncoordinates gives more insight into the asymptotic geometry of CMC hypersurfaces and its relationship to the Bondi\nexpansion on null hypersurfaces.\nWe first consider the problem of calculating the Bondi energy and momentum in general asymptotically flat spacetimes foliated by CMC hypersurfaces. Following Appendix A of Ref. [8], we analyze the asymptotic geometry using\nGaussian normal spatial coordinates tied to the I \u0307+ 2-surface. This gauge choice allows a relatively simple characterization of the asymptotic behavior of the spacetime metric and extrinsic curvature on a CMC hypersurface based\non asymptotic solutions of the constraint equations. Constructing the asymptotic coordinate transformation from the\nCMC-based coordinates to Bondi-Sachs null coordinates gives us the Bondi-Sachs mass aspect in terms of geometric\nobjects defined on a single CMC hypersurface. The monopole and dipole moments of the Bondi-Sachs mass aspect\nare the Bondi-Sachs energy and linear momentum, respectively. In the simple case of conformally flat initial data,\nthe mass aspect is just a sum of contributions from the asymptotic expansions of the conformal factor and conformal\nextrinsic curvature.\nThe Bowen-York solutions for the conformal extrinsic curvature contain parameters such as boost and spin vectors,\nwhich on maximal hypersurfaces are simply related to the ADM momentum and angular momentum. On CMC\nhypersurfaces, the relationship of the Bowen-York parameters to physical momenta and energies is more complicated,\nbut we are able to obtain analytic expressions for the direct contributions of the conformal extrinsic curvature to the\nBondi-Sachs energy and momentum in terms of the Bowen-York parameters. Unlike on maximal hypersurfaces, on\nconformally flat CMC hypersurfaces the coordinate displacement of the black hole from the center of the coordinate\nsphere representing I + enters in a non-trivial way. The conformal factor contributions to the Bondi-Sachs energy\nand momentum are extracted from the numerical solution of the Hamiltonian constraint equation. We also derive an\nanalytic expression for the total angular momentum of the system which only depends on the Bowen-York parameters,\nwithout any contribution from the conformal factor. We discuss the physical interpretation of some representative\nexamples of Bowen-York initial data on CMC hypersurfaces similar to those of Ref. [1], and show how to construct\ninitial data approximating a circular-orbit binary black hole system.\nThe Wald sign convention for the extrinsic curvature is adopted, so that the mean extrinsic curvature K is positive\nfor hypersurfaces with diverging future-directed normals, the hypersurfaces extending to future null infinity rather\nthan to spatial infinity (K = 0) or to past null infinity (K < 0). Our notation is an amalgam of that of Refs. [1, 17]\nand very similar to that in Appendix A of Ref. [8], but be alert to occasional deviations. We assume vacuum in a\nneighborhood of future null infinity. The discussion of the asymptotic geometry on general CMC hypersurfaces is\nin Sec. II. In Sec. III, we use the lapse and shift which preserve the CMC hypersurface condition and the Gaussian\nnormal spatial coordinate condition to facilitate the asymptotic transformation to Bondi-Sachs coordinates. The final\nexpression for the mass aspect depends only on the geometric properties of a single CMC hypersurface. Numerical\nresults for the generalized Bowen-York initial data on conformally flat CMC hypersurfaces are presented in Sec. IV.\nThe implications of our results for astrophysically interesting initial data are summarized in Sec. V. In Appendix A,\nwe derive the analytic expressions for the conformal extrinsic curvature contribution to Bondi-Sachs four-momentum\nand in Appendix B the analytic expression for the total angular momentum.\nII.\n\nASYMPTOTIC BEHAVIOR ON CMC HYPERSURFACES\n\nThe fact that the Hamiltonian constraint equation for the conformal factor and the momentum constraint equation\nfor the extrinsic curvature are degenerate at I + means that the first few terms in a power series expansion of these\nquantities away from I \u0307 + are uniquely determined from the expansion of the conformal spatial metric, in spite of the\nelliptic character of the equations and therefore the generally nonlocal character of the solutions. In our derivation\nof formulas for the Bondi-Sachs energy-momentum 4-vector, we will not assume the conformal spatial metric is flat,\nthough all of our numerical examples are for the conformally flat case. The expansion parameter defined in Ref. [1] is\nonly meaningful for a flat conformal spatial metric, so the analysis here follows the derivation of asymptotic behavior\npresented in Appendix A of Ref. [8], which in turn rather closely follows that of Ref. [9]. It is based on a particular\nchoice of spatial coordinates, Gaussian normal coordinates, in which the \"radial\" coordinate z is the conformal\nproper distance inward from I \u0307 + along normal spatial geodesics in the CMC hypersurface considered as a slice of the\nconformal spacetime. As in Ref. [8], we assume that the intrinsic geometry of I \u0307+ is that of a 2-sphere of fixed area in\nthe conformal geometry, which can be enforced in any asymptotically flat spacetime by suitable boundary conditions\non the initial conformal gauge and its subsequent evolution, at least if the gauge evolution variables are determined\nby elliptic equations, as in Refs. [5, 8]. Angular coordinates xA are propagated along the normal geodesics starting\nfrom standard polar angles on the I \u0307 + two-sphere. While the actual computational coordinates will be different, in\ngeneral, the coefficients in the expansions are expressed in terms of quantities defined covariantly and therefore can\n\n\f3\nbe computed in any coordinate system. An equality which holds only at I + is indicated by a dot above the equal\nsign.\nWe just give the key definitions and results here, and refer the reader to Ref. [8] for details of the derivations. The\nconformal spacetime metric g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd is related to the physical spacetime metric g\u03bc\u03bd by\ng\u0303\u03bc\u03bd = \u03a92 g\u03bc\u03bd ,\nand a tilde will be used generally to distinguish quantities associated with the conformal, rather than the physical,\ngeometry. The conformal factor is required to vanish on I + , where it cancels the infinities in the physical metric\ndue to the compactified spatial coordinates and the CMC hypersurfaces becoming asymptotically null, and is strictly\npositive in the interior. The general form of the conformal spatial metric in Gaussian normal coordinates is\ng\u0303ij dxi dxj = dz 2 + h\u0303AB dxA dxB ,\n\n(1)\n\n.\nwith z = 0 at I \u0307 + . A metric function \u03be is defined such that det h\u0303AB = \u03be \u22124 sin2 \u03b8. At I \u0307 + , h\u0303AB = \u03be0\u22122 h\u0306AB , with h\u0306AB\nthe standard metric of the unit two-sphere in polar coordinates. We require that \u03be0 be independent of angle. Then\nthe 2D scalar curvature of I \u0307 + is 2\u03be02 . The only way to preserve this property of I \u0307 + is to demand that \u2202t \u03be0 = 0\nduring the evolution as a condition on the evolution of the conformal gauge. We can keep the CMC time coordinate\n.\nt equal to a Minkowski retarded time coordinate u at I + by imposing the boundary condition \u03b1\u0303 = K/(3\u03be0 ) \u2261 \u03b1\u03030 on\nthe elliptic equation for the conformal lapse which follows from \u2202t K = 0.\nA general form for the expansion of h\u0303AB in powers of z away from I \u0307 + is then\n\u0011\ni\nh\n\u0010\n(2)\nh\u0303AB = \u03be \u22122 h\u0306AB \u2212 2\u03c7\u0306AB z + \u03c7\u0306CD \u03c7\u0306CD h\u0306AB \u2212 \u03c8\u0306AB z 2 + O(z 3 ) .\n\nHere \u03c7\u0306AB and \u03c8\u0306AB are traceless, symmetric tensors on the unit sphere with indices lowered and raised by h\u0306AB and\nits inverse. Note the identity that \u03c7\u0306AC \u03c7\u0306CB \u2261 12 \u03c7\u0306CD \u03c7\u0306CD h\u0306AB . As argued in Ref. [8], we believe it is consistent and\nphysically appropriate in the context of gravitational radiation generated by the internal dynamics of isolated systems\nnot to allow any polyhomogeneous terms, that is, terms containing powers of log z as well as powers of z, to this\norder in the expansion. The expansion of h\u0303AB is closely related to the expansion of the angular part of the metric in\nBondi-Sachs coordinates. Ref. [20] showed that the coefficient of the leading polyhomogeneous term of order r\u22121 log r\nor r\u22122 log r in the Bondi expansion is a constant of the motion, so if these terms are absent initially they never appear.\nIf these polyhomogeous terms are not present in the Bondi expansion, the corresponding terms are not present in\nEq. 2. The inverse of the angular part of the metric is\n\u0011\ni\nh\n\u0010\n(3)\nh\u0303AB = \u03be 2 h\u0306AB + 2\u03c7\u0306AB z + \u03c7\u0306CD \u03c7\u0306CD h\u0306AB + \u03c8\u0306 AB z 2 + O(z 3 ) .\n\nThe angular metric functions can be related to the extrinsic curvature \u03ba\u0303A\nB of the constant-z two-surfaces as embedded\nin the 3D conformal geometry of the CMC hypersurface. The trace of the 2D extrinsic curvature is \u03ba\u0303 = 2\u2202z (log \u03be),\nand the traceless part is\n2\nA\nA\n\u02c6A\n\u03ba\u0303\nB = \u03c7\u0306B + \u03c8\u0306B z + O(z ).\n\nThe expansion of \u03be as a power series in z can be expressed in terms of the expansion of \u03ba\u0303,\n\u03ba\u0303 = \u03ba\u03030 + \u03ba\u03031 z + \u03ba\u03032 z 2 + O(z 3 ),\nwith the result\n1\n1\n1\nlog \u03be = log \u03be0 + \u03ba\u03030 z + \u03ba\u03031 z 2 + \u03ba\u03032 z 3 + O(z 4 ).\n(4)\n2\n4\n6\nSatisfying our condition on the intrinsic geometry of I \u0307+ requires that \u03be0 be a constant, independent of both time and\nangle, but all of the coefficients in the expansion of \u03ba\u0303 will in general depend on the time t and the angular coordinates\nxA .

The vanishing of the Weyl tensor at I + , called the Penrose regularity condition in Ref. [8], is\na necessary condition for the absence of polyhomogeneous terms in the Bondi-Sachs asymptotic expansion based on\nspecial null coordinates (see Ref. [15]).\nThe time evolution of the conformal factor \u03a9 is given by\n\u0011\n1 \u0010\n(14)\n\u2202t \u03a9 = \u03b2 k \u2202k \u03a9 \u2212 \u03b1\u0303 K \u2212 \u03a9K\u0303 ,\n3\n\n\f5\nfrom which we see that K\u0303 controls how the conformal gauge evolves. We want the conformal gauge to be consistent\nwith I \u0307+ being a two-sphere at the coordinate position z = 0 at all times. Keeping I + at z = 0 requires the boundary\n.\n.\ncondition \u03b2 z = \u03b1\u0303 = \u03b1\u03030 on the shift, so \u2202t \u03a9 = 0 at z = 0. The only way to make sure that \u03be0 stays independent\n.\nof angle is to require that \u2202t \u03be0 = 0. We also require \u03b2 A = 0, in order that the angular coordinates be propagated\nalong the null generators of I + . These conditions greatly simplify the identification of the Bondi-Sachs mass aspect\nfrom the asymptotic behavior, since they make our coordinates close to inertial Bondi coordinates, for which the\nBondi-Sachs mass aspect can be read off directly from the asymptotic expansion of the Bondi-Sachs metric.\nThe evolution equation for \u03be, obtained from the evolution equation for the determinant of the angular part of the\nconformal metric in terms of the conformal extrinsic curvature, is\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1 \u02c6z 1\n\u2202t (log \u03be) = \u03b2 k \u2202k (log \u03be) \u2212 \u03b2 C \u0306|C + \u03b1\u0303\nK\u0303z \u2212 K\u0303 ,\n(15)\n2\n2\n3\nwhere \u03b2 C \u0306|C is the divergence of the angular part of the shift considered as a vector field on the unit sphere.

As long as the\nequation is elliptic, as in Refs. [8] and [5], the boundary condition is easily enforced. If the conformal gauge is evolved\nas part of a purely hyperbolic system, in which there are no boundary conditions at I + , things may not be so simple.\nIII.\n\nTHE BONDI-SACHS ENERGY AND MOMENTUM\n\nThe Bondi-Sachs energy is the true physical energy defined at future null infinity in asymptotically\nflat spacetimes.\n\u0001\nIts original definition [14, 15] was based on a special class of retarded null coordinates u, r, \u03b8\u0304, \u03c6\u0304 with a metric of the\nform, in close to the notation of Ref. [9],\n\u0001\n\u0001\nds2 = \u2212V e2\u03b2 du2 \u2212 2e2\u03b2 dudr + r2 h\u0304AB dx\u0304A \u2212 U A du dx\u0304B \u2212 U B du ,\n\nwhere h\u0304AB is a 2D metric asymptotically approaching the unit sphere metric h\u0306AB and whose determinant equals\nthe determinant of h\u0306AB everywhere. We put bars on the angular coordinates to distinguish them from the angular\ncoordinates in the CMC hypersurface. The expansion of h\u0304AB in powers of x \u2261 r\u22121 away from I + has the form\n1\nh\u0304AB = h\u0306AB + \u03c7\u0304AB x + \u03c7\u0304CD \u03c7\u0304CD h\u0306AB x2 + O(x3 ).\n4\n\n(18)\n\nThe absence of any traceless contribution to the O(x2 ) term in Eq. (18) implies the vanishing of the Weyl tensor on\nI + , as Eq. (12) did on CMC hypersurfaces. The remaining metric functions are asymptotically\n\u0001\nV = 1 \u2212 2 M u, \u03b8\u0304, \u03c6\u0304 x + O(x2 ),\n(19)\n\u03b2=\u2212\n\n1 BC\n\u03c7\u0304 \u03c7\u0304BC x2 + O(x3 ),\n32\n\n1\nU A = \u2212 \u03c7\u0304AB \u0306|B x2 + O(x3 ).\n2\n\n(20)\n\n(21)\n\n\u0001\nLike \u03c7\u0306AB , \u03c7\u0304AB u, \u03b8\u0304, \u03c6\u0304 is a traceless symmetric tensor on the unit sphere. Its retarded time derivative along I + is\nthe Bondi news.\n\u0001\nThe Bondi-Sachs metric function M u, \u03b8\u0304, \u03c6\u0304 is what was originally identified as the Bondi mass aspect [14]. Its\naverage over the unit sphere at a fixed retarded time u is the Bondi-Sachs energy EBS and the average over the unit\nsphere weighted by N i , where\nN i \u2261 (sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6, sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6, cos \u03b8),\n\n(22)\n\n\f6\nis the ith component of of the Bondi-Sachs momentum three-vector in the asymptotic Minkowski frame. However,\nthere are other less coordinate-specific definitions of the mass aspect which give the same Bondi-Sachs energy and\nmomentum when averaged. Some are based on the asymptotic behavior of Weyl tensor [15, 19, 21, 22] and some are\nbased on charge integrals derived from a Hamiltonian formalism (see, e.g., [17, 23]). What we will call the Bondi-Sachs\nmass aspect is not the metric function M , but rather the quantity which is monotonically decreasing on each of the\nnull generators of I + [23],\n1\nMA \u2261 M \u2212 \u03c7\u0304AB \u0306|AB .\n4\n\n(23)\n\nThe monopole and dipole angular moments of MA and M are identical for arbitrary \u03c7\u0304AB [17].\nThe task of actually calculating MA from data on a CMC hypersurface can be accomplished in various ways. The\ncharge integrals of Ref. [17] require comparing the actual spatial metric and extrinsic curvature on the hypersurface\nwith a background metric and extrinsic curvature. The results are sensitive to the choice of background quantities.\nThe only fail-safe procedure mentioned in Ref. [17] is to find the coordinate transformation from the CMC coordinates\nto Bondi coordinates, where the appropriate background spacetime metric is known, and then perform the inverse of\nthis coordinate transformation on the Bondi-Sachs background metric. However, once one has transformed to Bondi\ncoordinates, it is much simpler just to read off the Bondi-Sachs metric function M from the transformed metric. It is\nthe latter procedure that we will follow. While the coordinate transformation involves the lapse and shift for the CMC\ncoordinates, the final result only depends on the spatial metric and extrinsic curvature of a single CMC hypersurface.\nThe lapse and shift which preserve the CMC slicing condition and the Gaussian normal coordinates based on I \u0307 +\nwere derived in Appendix A of Ref. [8]. The singular terms in the elliptic equation for the conformal lapse allow no\nfreedom in the leading terms of the expansion away from I \u0307+ , with the result\n\u0015\n\u0013\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0001\n1\n1 1 2\n2\n3\nC D\n2\n.\n(24)\n\u03b1\u0303 = \u03b1\u03030 1 \u2212 \u03ba\u03030 z +\n\u03ba\u0303 \u2212 \u03ba\u03031 \u2212 3\u03c7\u0306 D \u03c7\u0306 C + 2\u03be0 z + O z\n2\n4 2 0\nThe coordinate components of the shift are, using the boundary condition on K\u0303 of Eq.

By\nconformal flatness we mean that the conformal spatial metric is Euclidean, g\u0303ij = \u03b4ij , but we still assume a CMC\nhypersurface. Future null infinity is a coordinate sphere,\np\nR \u2261 (x1 )2 + (x2 )2 + (x3 )2 = R+ .\n\nThe Gaussian normal coordinates based on I \u0307+ are z = R+ \u2212R and the usual polar angles xA of spherical coordinates.\nThe extrinsic curvature of constant-R two-surfaces is isotropic, with \u03ba\u0303 = 2/R = 2/(R+ \u2212 z), and\n\u03ba\u03030 =\n\n2\n= 2\u03be0 ,\nR+\n\n\u03ba\u03031 = 2\u03be0 2 ,\n\n\u03ba\u03032 = 2\u03be0 3 .\n\nNo gravitational waves are present at I \u0307+ , since \u03c7\u0306AB = \u03c8\u0306AB = 0.\nFor the conformal extrinsic curvature on the CMC hypersurface, we adopt the generalized Bowen-York solutions of\nthe vacuum momentum constraint equations from Ref.

Since the momentum constraint equations are linear, these solutions can be\nsuperimposed to generate initial data for multiple individual black holes or a single distorted black hole, depending\non whether, after solving for the conformal factor, there are disjoint apparent horizons or a single all-encompassing\napparent horizon. We follow Ref. [1] in only considering cases for which each solution represents a separate black\nhole centered at the coordinate position xi = Di , and impose an inner excision boundary condition for each black\nhole so that the coordinate sphere RD = Rms is a minimal 2-surface. The minimal surface condition, that the normal\nderivative of \u03a9 vanish, is an inner boundary condition on the elliptic equation for the conformal factor. The choice of\nRms is an additional input parameter for each black hole. In the limit Rms \u2192 0, the Einstein-Rosen bridge associated\n\n\f9\nwith the minimal surface becomes an infinitely long \"trumpet\" configuration. The minimal surface should be inside\nthe apparent horizon, which means Rms should not be too large and also requires C > 0.\nFor black holes on a conventional asymptotically flat (e.g. maximal) hypersurface, with the boundary condition\n\u03a9 \u2192 1 as R \u2192 \u221e, the sum of the boost 3-vectors P is the ADM linear momentum of the system. The physical\ninterpretation of the boost is not so straightforward on CMC hypersurfaces. The vector Q represents the boost of\nthe black hole as viewed from the other side of its Einstein-Rosen bridge. For a single centered black hole, it can be\nrelated to P through a condition of inversion symmetry about the minimal surface, but initial data without inversion\nsymmetry are also valid. In our numerical results we will take Q = 0. Note that \u00c3ij is finite and non-zero at future\nnull infinity, R = R+ , which means that the traceless part of the physical extrinsic curvature goes to zero as \u03a93 for\nall contributions. This is quite unlike the situation on maximal hypersurfaces.\nSince conformal flatness implies that the conformal Ricci tensor vanishes, the equation for \u03a9 simplifies to\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\n\u03a96\n \u0303 k\u03a9 \u2207\n \u0303 k\u03a9 \u2212 K\n \u0303 =3 \u2207\n+\n(43)\n\u00c3ij \u00c3ij ,\n\u03a9\u2206\u03a9\n2\n9\n4\n \u0303 the flat space Laplacian operator.

The two contributions to the Bondi-Sachs mass aspect are labeled by (MA )\u03a9 for the contribution\nfrom the conformal factor and by (MA )K for the contribution from the conformal extrinsic curvature.\nTo sum up, the Bondi-Sachs energy and 3-momentum associated with a CMC hypersurface are given by the integrals\non I \u0307+ :\nI\nI\nq\n1\n1\nEBS =\nMA det h\u0306AB dxA dxB =\nMA sin \u03b8d\u03b8d\u03c6\n(47)\n4\u03c0\n4\u03c0\n\nand\nk\nPBS\n\n1\n=\n4\u03c0\n\nI\n\nMA N k sin \u03b8d\u03b8d\u03c6.\n\n(48)\n\nAn expression for the angular momentum as an integral over I \u0307 + in the context of Bondi coordinates is given in Sec. 6\nof Ref.

(42), the only significant numerical task is solving the Hamiltonian constraint equation for the conformal\nfactor \u03a9. Our results are obtained with the pseudospectral elliptic solver that is part of the Caltech-Cornell-CITA\nSpectral Einstein Code (SpEC), described in detail in Refs. [11, 12]. The overall domain is divided into a number of\nsub-domains, which are spherical near the boundary at R = R+ . The output for the conformal factor in the outermost\nspherical\nP sub-domain, from an inner radius R1 to R+ , is in the form of coefficients of a spherical harmonic expansion\n\u03a9 = l,m \u03a9lm Ylm at each of a number of radial collocation points.\nTo obtain the coefficients of the spherical harmonic expansion of c\u03043 , we fit the asymptotic form of Eq. (44) to the\nnumerical results for the conformal factor \u03a9. It is counterproductive to use collocation points too close to R+ where\nthe small contribution of the c\u03043 terms to \u03a9 may not be large compared to numerical error, so we exclude collocation\npoints with z\u0304 < z\u03042 and fit\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n3\n1 2\n\u03a9lm \u2212 z\u0304 + z\u0304\n(1 + z\u0304) z\u0304 4 KR+\n2\nto the form\n(c\u03043 )lm + elm z\u0304 2 + flm z\u0304 3\nusing a standard Grace1 curve-fitting routine. In practice, for single black holes, we find that taking R1 /R+ = 0.95\nand z\u03042 & 0.02 gives values of (c\u03043 )00 stable to about 1 part in 105 , as long as the black hole centers are within 0.12 R+\nor so, and the boost parameters are not too large. We also need the coefficients of the spherical harmonic expansion\nof \u0100RR , which are obtained analytically in Appendix A for l = 0 and l = 1.

(50) (see Appendix B).\nThere are two arbitrary scale factors in our problem, the choice of the unit of mass-length-time and in the definition\nof the conformal factor. Only combinations of variables invariant under both a change of units and a uniform conformal\nrescaling are physically meaningful. Combinations of the input parameters with this property are:\nC\u0304 \u2261 (K/3)2 C, P\u0304 i \u2261 (K 2 R+ /18)P i , Q\u0304i \u2261 (K 2 /18R+)Qi , S\u0304 i \u2261 S i /C, R\u0304ms \u2261 Rms /R+ , D\u0304i \u2261 Di /R+ .\n\n(54)\n\n1\n\nFor sufficiently small R\u0304ms , so there is a trumpet-like configuration inside the apparent horizon, C\u0304 2 \u2248 (K/3)M for a\nSchwarzschild-like black hole of mass M (see Fig. 4 in Ref. [1]). Making C\u0304 \u226a 1 ensures that the warping effects of\nthe mean extrinsic curvature are small in the vicinity of the apparent horizon of a centered black hole. As argued in\nRef. [1], when this is the case, the physical momentum should be roughly \u03a9max times the boost. From the asymptotic\nsolution for the conformal factor, \u03a9max \u2248 |\u2202\u03a9/\u2202R|R+ (R+ /2) = KR+ /6, so that we expect KR+ /6 times the BowenYork boost (or 3/K times P\u0304 i ) to be a rough estimate of the physical Bondi-Sachs 3-momentum of the black hole.\n2\nInversion symmetry about the apparent horizon, as sometimes assumed, implies Qi = \u00b1Rms\nP i , so at I + the Qi terms\n2\ni\nin the conformal extrinsic curvature are of order R\u0304ms times the P terms and typically make a negligible contribution\nto the Bondi-Sachs momentum. We will simply take Qi = 0 in our numerical calculations. Well away from any black\nhole apparent horizons and not too close to R+ (R < R+ /3), the conformal factor plateaus near its maximum value,\nso in this regime physical distances are roughly coordinate distances divided by KR+ /6.\np\nA key output parameter is the dimensionless rescaled \"irreducible mass\" M\u0304irr \u2261 (K/3)Mirr = (K/3) A/16\u03c0, where\nA is the area of the black hole apparent horizon. The irreducible mass is used to scale the results for the Bondi-Sachs\nenergy, momentum, and mass. In Ref. [1], the irreducible mass is used as a surrogate for the physical mass in the\ndiscussion of results, so giving our results in units of the irreducible mass facilitates comparison with that paper.\nFor single black holes, we vary the Bowen-York parameters starting from a representative spherically symmetric\nmodel that has C\u0304 = 0.0011207, R\u0304ms = 0.00127, and M\u0304irr = 0.028339. For these parameters, the effects of the non-zero\nK start becoming important at about 10 times the radius of the apparent horizon, which means initial data near\nthe black hole are similar to initial data on a conventional maximal hypersurface. We also present results for two\nexamples of binary black hole initial data.\nA.\n\nSingle spinning black hole\n\nHere we see how the Bondi-Sachs mass for a single centered black hole with no Bowen-York boostqvaries with\n\u00012\nBowen-York spin S = (0, 0, S). As the dimensionless magnitude of the spin S\u0304 increases, we keep C\u0304eff \u2261 C\u0304 1 + 2 S\u0304\n1\n\nrather than C\u0304 constant, because the square root of C\u0304eff tracks M\u0304irr much better than C\u0304 2 as S\u0304 becomes larger than 1.\nThere is no linear momentum, so the Bondi-Sachs mass equals the Bondi-Sachs energy, and by Eq. (50) the angular\nmomentum equals the spin. The ratio MBS /Mirr \u22121 is plotted in Fig. 1 as a function of the spin extremality parameter\n2\n\u03b6 \u2261 S/(2Mirr\n), for 0 \u2264 \u03b6 \u2264 0.78. The sequence terminates at \u03b6 = 0.78 in the limit S\u0304 \u2192 \u221e for conformally flat initial\ndata (see Ref. [1]). We also plot the corresponding quantity for the Christodoulou mass [24] MC , which is defined as\nthe mass of the Kerr black hole with the same Mirr and angular momentum. The Bondi-Sachs mass for our initial\ndata is a bit larger than the mass of the Kerr black hole for the same \u03b6, but the maximum MC /Mirr \u2212 1 is significantly\nlarger, 0.414, because for a Kerr black hole the maximum \u03b6 and the maximum J/MC2 are both 1.\nB.\n\nSingle displaced black hole with zero spin and boost\n\nNow we displace a single, non-spinning, unboosted black hole a coordinate distance D (in the x-direction) from\nthe center of the I \u0307+ coordinate sphere. The other Bowen-York parameters are the same as for our representative\nspherically symmetric black hole. Surprisingly, rather than being zero, the velocity of the black hole in the asymptotic\nMinkowski frame (given by the ratio of the Bondi-Sachs momentum to the Bondi-Sachs energy) is proportional to\nand in the same direction as the displacement from the origin, as shown in Fig. 2.

With D\u0304 = 0.1, M\u0304irr = 0.028340,\nand C\u0304 = 0.0011207, the fractional extrinsic curvature contributions to the Bondi-Sachs energy and momentum are,\nrespectively, (EBS )K /EBS = \u22120.039 and (PBS )K /PBS = \u22120.019.\nAs an indication of whether the displaced black hole is just a moving Schwarzschild black hole or whether it has\nadditional distortions, we compare the Bondi-Sachs mass as given by Eq. (53) with the irreducible mass derived from\nthe area of the apparent horizon. We find that these are the same to the numerical accuracy of our calculations\n(about 5 significant figures), which suggests that the displaced black hole is in fact just a Schwarzschild black hole in\nan asymptotic Lorentz frame in which the black hole is not at rest. We have not tried to prove this more decisively,\nby finding the coordinate transformation to the conventional form of the Schwarzschild metric.\n\n\f13\nC.\n\nSingle centered boosted black hole\n\nNow consider a Bowen-York boost as the only deviation from Schwarzschild. On an asymptotically flat hypersurface,\nsuch as a maximal hypersurface, the Bowen-York boost is equal to the physical ADM momentum. In the limit of\nsmall K 2 C, there is a range of R over which \u03a9 is roughly constant near its maximum and Mirr << R/\u03a9 << 1/K,\na region of the CMC hypersurface approximating the asymptotic part of a maximal hypersurface. Ref. [1] argued on\nthis basis for using P \u03a9max as an estimate of the Bondi-Sachs linear momentum. The close agreement between P\u0304 z and\nz\n(K/3)PBS\nin Table I shows that over the entire range of boosts considered, (KR+ /6)P z is within about one percent\nz\nof PBS . The ratio of the actual numerical result for \u03a9max to the KR+ /6 analytic estimate varies from 0.931 to 0.858\nover this range, so it is considerably better to use the analytic estimate for \u03a9max , rather than its actual numerical\nvalue, in relating the Bowen-York boost to the physical momentum of a centered black hole.\nThe fact that MBS /Mirr becomes significantly larger than 1 as the black hole motion becomes relativistic shows\nthat the boosted Bowen-York black holes are definitely not simply Schwarzschild black holes moving relative to the\nasymptotic Minkowski frame. There is additional energy associated with non-kinematic distortions of the geometry.\nFrom Eq. (A2), we see that for centered black holes, the direct contribution to the Bondi-Sachs energy from the\nconformal extrinsic curvature is independent of the boost, and for the initial data calculated here, (EBS )K /Mirr \u2248\n\u22120.04, which is small compared with the positive contribution from conformal factor. In contrast, the the Bondi-Sachs\nmomentum is strongly dominated by the contribution from the conformal extrinsic curvature for centered black holes,\nsince by Eq. (A4), (PBS )K = (3/K)P\u0304.\nThe Qi boosts are taken to be zero rather than the inversion-symmetric values often assumed in Bowen-York\ninitial value calculations on maximal hypersurfaces (e.g., in Ref. [25]). Only one side of the Einstein-Rosen bridge\nis astrophysically relevant, since the other side cannot exert any causal influence on the astrophysical side. There is\nno very compelling reason, other than geometrical elegance, to assume any symmetry between the two sides of the\nbridge or that the bridges of multiple black holes connect to a common asymptotically flat space. The geometry of\nthe physical space in the immediate vicinity of the black holes may depend to some extent on whether the Qi are\nzero or inversion symmetric, with possible small effects on the results for the Bondi energy and momentum, but such\neffects should not be noticeable for the near trumpet considered here, and disappear completely in the limit of an\nextreme trumpet configuration (Rms \u2192 0).\nP\u0304 z \u00d7 10\nz\n(K/3)PBS\n\n0.0\n\n0.13889 0.27778 0.55556 0.83333 1.11111 1.38889\n\n\u00d7 10\n0.0 0.13641 0.27352 0.54974\n(K/3)Mirr \u00d7 10 0.28339 0.28334 0.28338 0.28361\nz\nPBS\n/Mirr\n0.0 0.48142 0.96521 1.93839\nEBS /Mirr\n1.0 1.11221 1.41439 2.32632\nMBS /Mirr\n1.0 1.00261 1.03387 1.28624\n\n0.82708\n0.28382\n2.91413\n3.39577\n1.74330\n\n1.10474\n0.28390\n3.89129\n4.52196\n2.30348\n\n1.38249\n0.28388\n4.87005\n5.67844\n2.92016\n\nTABLE I: Centered black hole with varying Bowen-York boost P\u0304 z . The C\u0304 parameter is fixed at our adopted standard value,\nand Rms /R+ is adjusted to keep the irreducible mass roughly constant as P\u0304 z increases. The input and output quantities are\ntabulated in the dimensionless and conformal-scale invariant forms discussed earlier in Section IV.\n\nFor a slightly different slant on our results, we plot in Fig. 3 (i) the fractional \"excess mass\" of the black hole\nz\nMBS /Mirr \u2212 1, (ii) the velocity of the black hole v z \u2261 PBS\n/EBS in the asymptotic Minkowski frame, and (iii) the\nsimilar excess ADM mass for a boosted Bowen-York black hole on a maximal hypersurface, all as functions of the\nratio of the appropriate physical momentum (Bondi-Sachs or ADM) to the irreducible mass. Data for the last curve\nare taken from Table II of Ref. [25], for C = 0 and inversion-symmetric Qi . Note that as the boost and physical\nmomentum increase, the gravitational mass MBS (solid black curve) increases rapidly enough that the black hole's\nz\nvelocity v z \u2261 PBS\n/EBS (violet dash-dot curve) asymptotes to a value less than one (about 0.86). The results of\nRef. [25] are quite similar, but with a slightly higher asymptotic velocity. The excess gravitational mass can be\nthought of as energy stored in distortions of the geometry relative to a boosted Schwarzschild black hole, energy\nwhich would be radiated into the black hole and to infinity during subsequent evolution.\nThe black holes on CMC hypersurfaces have more excess mass than the corresponding black holes on maximal\nhypersurfaces, modestly so as long as the motion of the black holes is non-relativistic, but more substantially as the\nmotion becomes relativistic. The Cook and York initial data has C = 0, which in the case of spherical symmetry\nmeans that their maximal slice passes through the intersection of the future and past Schwarzschild event horizons,\nas opposed to the more trumpet-like configurations chosen here and emphasized in Ref. [1].

Using data from Table I above and Table II of Cook and York [25],\nwe plot (i) the fractional excess of the Bondi-Sachs mass over the irreducible mass (solid black line), (ii) the corresponding\nexcess ADM mass of Bowen-York initial data on maximal hypersurfaces (dashed red curve), and (iii) the velocity of the black\nz\nhole v z = PBS\n/EBS (dash-dot violet line) in our initial data. All quantities are shown as a function of the ratio of physical\nmomentum, PBS or PADM as appropriate, to the irreducible mass. The curves are interpolations between results for discrete\nmodels.\n\nD.\n\nDisplaced and boosted black holes\n\nIn this section, we lay the groundwork for building a binary black hole initial data set on CMC hypersurfaces.\nFor binary black holes in circular orbit, we want each black hole considered by itself to have zero radial momentum\nand transverse momentum corresponding to that of a mass in a circular orbit, which can be estimated crudely from\nthe Newtonian equations of motion. Since we have seen that a displaced unboosted black hole on a CMC slice has\na non-zero radial momentum, this requires finding the radial boost which makes the net Bondi-Sachs momentum\nof a displaced single black hole zero, and then the transverse boost which generates the desired transverse physical\nmomentum. Once this is done for each black hole of the binary considered separately, the Bowen-York data for the\nblack holes can be superimposed and the Bondi-Sachs energy and momentum of the full system calculated. As long\nas the two black holes are well-separated, we should find that the Bondi-Sachs energy of the combined system is less\nthan the sum of the energies of the black holes considered separately by something close to the Newtonian binding\nenergy of the system, provided that the total Bondi-Sachs momentum of the system is close to zero.\nThe first step is to construct a single black hole which is displaced from the center of the coordinate grid and at\nrest. Fig. 4 shows that this result can be achieved by giving the black hole an appropriate boost antiparallel to its\ndisplacement. For the example shown in Fig. 4, the hole is displaced in the positive x-direction, with D\u0304x = 0.1. A\nrescaled boost P\u0304 x = \u22120.006 very nearly cancels the radial momentum associated with the displacement, yielding a\nx\nnet PBS\n/Mirr = \u22129.6 \u00d7 10\u22126 .\nNext, we build an initial data set with two non-spinning displaced black holes, each of which considered separately\nhas zero Bondi-Sachs momentum, and calculate the gravitational binding energy; i.e., the decrease in the Bondi-Sachs\nenergy of the combined system compared with the sum of Bondi-Sachs energies of each hole separately. The input\nparameters are chosen so that, as estimated by the procedures outlined in Sec. IIID of [1] for Schwarzschild black\nholes, the ratio of minimal surface radius to horizon radius for each hole is about 0.8, the ratio of the black hole masses\nM A /M B \u2248 2/1, and the total rescaled irreducible mass of the system is about 0.7 that of our standard single black\nx\nx\nhole. We locate holes A and B along the x-axis at D\u0304A\n= 0.04 and D\u0304B\n= \u22120.08, so the center of mass of the system\nA\nB\nis close to the origin. The values for C\u0304 and C\u0304 are, respectively, 0.000228 and 0.0000568. The scaled minimal\nB\nA\nsurface radii are R\u0304ms\n= 0.000978 and R\u0304ms\n= 0.000489. We apply Bowen-York boosts which for each black hole in\nisolation approximately cancel the Bondi-Sachs radial momentum due to that hole's displacement. The dimensionless\nA\nB\nBondi-Sachs masses (M\u0304BS \u2261 (K/3)MBS ) for each hole in isolation are M\u0304BS\n= 0.013104 and M\u0304BS\n= 0.006604. When\nthe black holes are superimposed, we find that the combined Bondi-Sachs momentum is less than the sum of the\nalready small values for the individual holes. The dimensionless Bondi-Sachs mass of the superimposed black holes\nis M\u0304BS = 0.019368, which is 0.000340 less than the sum of the individual values. The Newtonian gravitational\nbinding energy of the system is U = M A M B /rAB \u2248 \u03a9max M A M B /|DA \u2212 DB | or, using the analytic estimate of\n\n\f15\n\n0.1\n\nP\n\nx\nBS\n\n/ Mirr\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n-0.1\n-0.009\n\n-0.006\n\nx\n\n-0.003\n\n0\n\nP\n\nFIG. 4: Finding the Bowen-York boost that cancels the Bondi-Sachs momentum associated with the displacement D\u0304x = 0.1.\nThe CMC parameters have their usual values, except that R\u0304ms is varied with the boost to keep M\u0304irr approximately constant.\n\nA\nB\nM\u0304BS\n\u03a9max , KU/3 \u2248 0.5R+ M\u0304BS\n/|D\u0304A \u2212 D\u0304B | = 0.000371, which is reasonably close to the rescaled general relativistic\nbinding energy.\nThe third step is to determine how Bowen-York boosts transverse to a black hole's displacement translate into the\ntransverse motion of the black hole as revealed by its physical transverse momentum. We have calculated the BondiSachs energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum of a displaced black hole with nearly zero radial momentum\nand various transverse boosts. The relationship between transverse boost and transverse physical momentum is very\nclose to what we found between boost and momentum for a centered black hole in Sec. IV C. An example of the\ncomparison for a black hole given a moderately relativistic Bowen-York boost transverse to the displacement in the\nx-direction is given in Table II. We conclude that it is acceptable to use the results for a centered boosted black hole\nin Sec. IV C, including the analytic formula, when estimating the transverse Bowen-York boosts appropriate for black\nholes in quasi-circular binary orbits. Of course, the displaced black holes also acquire orbital angular momentum\naccording to Eq. (50).\ny\n2\n/Mirr EBS /Mirr MBS /Mirr J z /Mirr\nD\u0304x P\u0304 y \u00d7 10 (K/3)Mirr \u00d7 10 PBS\n\n0 0.13889\n0.1 0.13889\n\n0.28334\n0.28336\n\n0.48142\n0.47686\n\n1.11220\n1.11117\n\n1.00261\n1.00365\n\n0\n3.45956\n\nTABLE II: A centered black hole (first row) and a displaced black hole (second row) are both given the same mildly relativistic\n(transverse) rescaled Bowen-York boosts P\u0304 y = 0.013889. The displaced black hole is also given a longitudinal rescaled boost\nP\u0304 x = \u22120.00660 to approximately cancel the physical momentum associated with the displacement. The other input parameters\nfor both holes have the standard values. The black holes have almost identical physical properties, except for the orbital angular\nmomentum of the displaced hole.\n\nThe close relationship between the transverse Bondi-Sachs momentum and the transverse rescaled Bowen-York\nboost can be understood as a consequence of the dominance of the direct contribution to the Bondi-Sachs momentum\nfrom the conformal extrinsic curvature, as calculated in Eq. (A4), over the contribution from the conformal factor\nfor these transverse components. As long as D\u0304 is reasonably small, the dominant transverse term in Eq. (A4) is just\n(KR+ /6)Ptrans . There is no simple relation between the longitudinal component of the Bondi-Sachs momentum and\nthe longitudinal component of the Bowen-York boost because the conformal factor contribution to the longitudinal\ncomponent is not small.\nE.\n\nBinary black hole initial data\n\nHere we build on the results of the previous subsections to construct initial data for two spinning unequal-mass\nblack holes with initial momenta roughly appropriate for circular orbits. The input parameters are chosen based on a\nNewtonian analysis, in circumstances such that the post-Newtonian corrections are roughly at the 10% level. Ignoring\n\n\f16\nrelativistic corrections is consistent with other sources of uncertainty, such as estimating parameters for each black\nhole in isolation, ignoring their tidal interactions. While similar initial data were presented in [1], we are now on much\nfirmer ground in considering the relationship between the Bowen-York parameters and the physical properties of each\nhole.\nWe consider two examples. Both are constructed to have about a 2:1 mass ratio and roughly a 12:1 ratio of physical\ndistance between the black holes to the total gravitational mass of the system. The minimal surface radii are chosen\nto give moderately trumpet-like configurations. The black holes are assigned close to maximal spins oriented in the\norbital plane and perpendicular to the displacement between the holes. In one case (Case I), the ratio of coordinate\nseparation of the holes to the coordinate radius of I + is 0.12, and in the other case (Case II), it is three times larger.\nIn the latter case, there is the potential for greater computational efficiency, since the black holes can be resolved with\na lower resolution grid.\nThe Newtonian analysis of a circular orbit binary system with masses MA and MB separated by a distance rAB\ngives for the equal and opposite momenta of the masses\nr\nMA MB\nMA + MB\ny\ny\nPA = \u2212PB =\n,\nMA + MB\nrAB\nperpendicular to the displacements of the black holes (which are along the x-axis). Equating the transverse rescaled\nBowen-York boost to K/3 times the transverse physical momentum, for MA \u2248 2MB , we choose P\u0304 y = 0.064(K/3)(MA+\nMB ), since rAB is about 12 times the total mass. Estimating black hole masses from the Bowen-York parameters is a\nbit uncertain when the black holes are not Schwarzschild, but consistency with the total system mass can be verified\nretrospectively.\ny\nThe non-zero input parameters chosen for Case I are C\u0304A = 2.4531 \u00d7 10\u22125 , C\u0304B = 5.1224 \u00d7 10\u22126 , S\u0304A\n= 6.5224, S\u0304By =\nx\nx\nA\nB\n\u22127.8088, D\u0304A\n= 0.04, D\u0304B\n= \u22120.08, R\u0304ms\n= 9.78 \u00d7 10\u22124 , R\u0304ms\n= 4.89 \u00d7 10\u22124 , and boost components P\u0304Ax = \u22120.001074,\nP\u0304Ay = 0.00116, P\u0304Bx = 0.001060, P\u0304By = \u22120.00116. As noted in Sec. IV A, we expect the rescaled black hole masses to\n\u0014 q\n\u0015\n\u00012 1/2\nscale roughly as C\u0304eff = C\u0304 1 + 2 S\u0304\n, which is 0.0150864 for hole A and 0.0075366 for hole B. The large values\n\nof S\u0304 for each hole mean that the black holes have close to the maximum possible spin extremality parameter \u03b6.\ny\nIn Case II, the input parameters are C\u0304A = 3.6231 \u00d7 10\u22124 , C\u0304B = 8.5343 \u00d7 10\u22125 , S\u0304A\n= 3.9347, S\u0304By = \u22124.1761,\nx\nx\nA\n\u22123\nB\n\u22123\nD\u0304A = 0.12, D\u0304B = \u22120.24, R\u0304ms = 2.934 \u00d7 10 , R\u0304ms = 1.467 \u00d7 10 , and boost components P\u0304Ax = \u22120.010026,\nP\u0304Ay = 0.00348, P\u0304Bx = 0.010617, P\u0304By = \u22120.003639. The C\u0304eff values are 0.04526 for hole A and 0.02261 for hole B, about\nthree times the values in Case I, while the D\u0304 values are also three times larger. This suggests the two cases are similar\nin the ratio of physical separation of the holes to the total mass of the system. The S\u0304 values are smaller in Case II\nthan in Case I; this is because the elliptic solver failed to converge if we tried to make the S\u0304 values as large as in Case\nI. Another effect of the larger ratio of the size of the binary system to 3/K in Case II is the larger P\u0304 x values needed\nto cancel out the radial components of the individual black hole momenta.\nOur results for the irreducible masses and angular momenta of the individual holes and the physical energy, momentum, mass, and angular momentum of the systems are given in Table III. Note that there are non-zero, though\nsmall, z-components for the system velocities even though none of the boosts has a non-zero z-component. This is\nthe result of the spins of the black holes interacting with the geometry of the hypersurface, one indication of which\nis the D \u00d7 S term in Eq. (A4). Also, note that K/3 = 0.02 gives a total system mass close to 1 in Case I, and this\ntogether with R+ = 100 makes coordinate distances close to physical distances. The same is true for Case II since K\nis increased and R+ is decreased by a factor of 3. The calculations for Case II took about 80% of the time on the same\ncomputer as the calculations for Case I, indicating some potential for realizing increased efficiency of computation by\nhaving the binary system occupy a larger fraction of the conformal domain.\nWhile the system momentum and velocity should ideally be zero, this is not precisely the case in our calculations,\nwhich made no attempt to fine-tune the input parameters. Still, the residual system velocities are quite small compared\nwith the Newtonian estimates for the orbital velocities. The system mass is significantly greater than the sum of the\nirreducible masses in both Cases I and Case II, since the contributions of the spins to the black hole hole masses\ndominates over their gravitational binding energy. The slightly smaller spins in Case II make this effect somewhat\nsmaller there. Of course, the system mass can never be less than the total irreducible mass.\nV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe first part of this paper is a discussion of the asymptotic behavior of the conformal factor \u03a9, the conformal spatial\nmetric, and the conformal extrinsic curvature of CMC hypersurfaces in the neighborhood of I + as constrained by the\ninitial value equations for astrophysically general asymptotically flat spacetimes, and a calculation of the Bondi-Sachs\n\n\f17\ny\nx\nz\n/EBS PBS\n/EBS PBS\n/EBS (K/3)2 J x (K/3)2 J y (K/3)2 J z\nM\u0304irr (K/3)EBS (K/3)MBS PBS\n2\n2\n2\n3\n3\n\u00d710\n\u00d710\n\u00d710\n\u00d710\n\u00d710\n\u00d7103\n\u00d7104\n\u00d7104\n\u00d7104\n\nCase I\nhole A:\nhole B:\nsystem:\nCase II\nhole A:\nhole B:\nsystem:\n\n1.06367\n0.53449\n1.59816\n\nn/a\nn/a\n1.96685\n\nn/a\nn/a\n1.96685\n\nn/a\nn/a\n-1.04379\n\nn/a\nn/a\n0.25464\n\nn/a\nn/a\n0.05850\n\n0\n0\n0\n\n1.60000\n-0.40000\n1.20000\n\n0.92800\n1.85600\n2.78400\n\n3.16247\n1.62032\n4.78280\n\nn/a\nn/a\n5.90011\n\nn/a\nn/a\n5.90003\n\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\n-5.25838 -0.16546 0.17739\n\n0\n0\n0\n\n14.25600 8.35200\n-3.56400 17.46720\n10.69200 25.81920\n\nTABLE III: Physical quantities for two binary black hole initial data sets. (See text for input parameter values.) From left\nto right are the irreducible masses, the Bondi-Sachs energy, the Bondi-Sachs mass, the system velocity components, and the\nangular momentum components, all made dimensionless by appropriate powers of K/3. There are no well-defined Bondi-Sachs\nenergy and linear momentum for the individual black holes, but the angular momenta can be calculated using Eq. (B7).\n\nmass aspect in terms of the coefficients in the expansion away from the I \u0307+ 2-surface, which is the intersection of the\nCMC hypersurface with the I + null hypersurface. In this analysis, we adopt special spatial coordinates, Gaussian\nnormal coordinates based on I \u0307 + , and use the conformal proper distance z from I \u0307+ along the normal spatial geodesics\nas the expansion parameter. Angular coordinates are propagated along the normal spatial geodesics, initialized to be\nstandard polar coordinates on I \u0307+ , which is assumed to be a true sphere with intrinsic curvature \u03be02 . This is not a\nphysical constraint for an asymptotically flat spacetime with a topologically spherical null infinity, just a constraint on\nthe conformal gauge. The asymptotic expansion is essentially identical to that presented in Ref. [9], except we do not\nallow the polyhomogeneous terms in the expansion of the angular part of the conformal spatial metric through O(z 2 )\nthat are a major focus of that paper. No such terms are present unless they are present at some arbitrarily early time,\nwhich means that they should be associated with incoming radiation at past null infinity. In typical astrophysical\nproblems incoming radiation near I + should only be generated by backscatter or nonlinear interaction of outgoing\nradiation, and should not be present ab initio, except for what might be plausibly associated with backscatter of\nradiation emitted before the start of the numerical calculation.\nAs noted in Ref. [9], polyhomogeneous terms are nevertheless generically present at O(z 4 ) in the expansion of the\nconformal factor and at O(z 2 ) in the expansion of the conformal extrinsic curvature. The authors of Ref. [9] considered\nthe vanishing of the expression in Eq. (39) a condition for the absence of these polyhomogeneous terms, but we point\nout that the condition cannot be satisfied over any finite time interval in which outgoing gravitational radiation, as\nindicated by time variation of \u03c7\u0306AB , is present at I + (see also Ref. [8]). The implied smoothness of only C 3 for the\nconformal factor and C 1 for the conformal extrinsic curvature at I + is a gauge artifact of the CMC hypersurface\ncondition. The offending terms are not present if the physical mean curvature K has precisely the right angular\ndependence at O(z 3 ) in a power series expansion away from I \u0307+ . This cannot be accomplished by any predetermined\nspecification of K, but maintaining a high degree of smoothness at I + is possible with fully hyperbolic evolution\nschemes, such as the regular conformal field equations of Friedrich [26, 27], as well as with the Bondi-Sachs gauge.\nFor the assumed special geometric properties of I \u0307 + to be preserved during evolution, a constraint must be placed\non the evolution of the conformal factor; specifically, that the trace of the conformal extrinsic curvature K\u0303 satisfy the\nboundary condition of Eq. (17). This says that the 3D mean conformal extrinsic curvature of the CMC hypersurface\nat I \u0307+ , which governs the evolution of the conformal factor, should equal the 2D mean extrinsic curvature of the\nI \u0307+ 2-surface when both are renormalized according to their respective number of dimensions. All this also assumes\npreservation of the coordinate location of I + as a coordinate sphere centered at the origin and propagation of the\nangular coordinates on I + along its null generators, which imposes boundary conditions on the shift vector. These\nboundary conditions can be implemented in a mixed hyperbolic-elliptic evolution scheme like those of Ref. [5] or\nRef. [8]. Also, we impose the usual regularity conditions at I + , the \"zero-shear\" condition and the vanishing of the\nWeyl tensor, which as shown for the evolution schemes of [5, 8], are preserved by the evolution equations.\nWe have applied this asymptotic analysis to derive the expression for the Bondi-Sachs mass aspect given in Eq. (38),\nfrom which the Bondi-Sachs energy and momentum can be calculated as appropriate angular averages over I \u0307+ . This\nis a 3D expression, involving only quantities evaluated on a single CMC hypersurface. The 3D expression derived in\nSection 5.3 of Ref. [17] requires knowledge of a \"background\" metric and extrinsic curvature in addition to the actual\nmetric and extrinsic curvature of the CMC hypersurface. It is non-trivial to determine the appropriate background\nquantities. The terms appearing in Eq. (38) are simply related to the asymptotic behavior of the conformal factor,\n\n\f18\nconformal metric, and conformal extrinsic curvature in Gaussian normal coordinates, and can be determined by solving\nthe geodesic equation for the geodesics normal to I \u0307 + in the CMC hypersurface in any computational spatial gauge\nsatisfying our boundary conditions. The alternative expression of Eq. (40) based on the Weyl tensor is completely\nequivalent, as can be seen by evaluating the Weyl tensor in the form of Eq. (41) in Gaussian normal coordinates.\nWith conformally flat initial data, all of this simplifies drastically. With I \u0307+ a coordinate sphere of constant radius\nin a flat conformal geometry, the normal geodesics are radial, and the 2D extrinsic curvature of surfaces of constant\ncoordinate radius R is just R\u22121 times the unit sphere metric. The momentum constraint equation admits solutions\nidentical in form to the Bowen-York solutions. We have shown in the Appendices how to evaluate analytically the\nangular integrals of the term coming from the conformal extrinsic curvature in the mass aspect in terms of the\nBowen-York parameters. The only numerical calculation necessary is solving the Hamiltonian constraint equation for\nthe conformal factor and fitting to a power series expansion in the coordinate distance from I \u0307+ , taking advantage\nof the known analytic form through order z 5 . We have computed how the Bondi-Sachs energy-momentum and the\nangular momentum of the system depend on the Bowen-York parameters for a sampling of single and double black\nhole systems, similar to those considered in Ref. [1].\nFor a single black hole centered at the origin, with varying Bowen-York spin (which in this case equals the system\nangular momentum), the results are displayed in Fig. 1. They show that the \"rotational energy\" of the black hole,\nthe excess of the Bondi-Sachs mass over the irreducible mass, has a dependence on the spin extremality parameter\n\u03b6 similar to that of Kerr black holes. The Bondi-Sachs mass is a bit larger in our case, as one would expect. The\nmain difference is that our sequence cannot be extended to as large a value of the extremality parameter as the Kerr\nsequence.\nA single non-spinning, unboosted black hole displaced from the origin, i.e., displaced relative to the center of the\nsphere representing future null infinity, is more interesting. As shown in Fig. 2, the displaced black hole acquires\na velocity in the asymptotic Minkowski frame in the direction of its displacement close to twice the ratio of the\ndisplacement to R+ . Consequently, when constructing initial data for black hole binaries on CMC hypersurfaces,\ncompensating Bowen-York boosts directed inward should be introduced for each displaced black hole, so that its net\nradial velocity is zero.\nResults for a single centered black hole given various, mostly rather large, boosts are presented in Sec. IV B. Here\nwe emphasize how close the numerical result for the Bondi-Sachs momentum PBS is to KR+ /6 times the BowenYork boost vector, even when the black hole is moving at relativistic speeds. Ref. [1], presented a crude hand-waving\nargument that the physical momentum should be roughly \u03a9max (calculated numerically) times the boost. The expected\naccuracy of this estimate was of order KMirr , or about 10% for our choices of Bowen-York parameters. Comparison\nof the first two rows of Table I shows that KR+ /6 times the boost is within about 1% of PBS , while KR+ /6 differs\nfrom \u03a9max by about 10%. The physical properties of these boosted centered black holes are explored further in Fig. 3\nand compared with corresponding results for boosted black holes on maximal hypersurfaces. In both cases, the ratio\nof physical mass to irreducible mass increases rather rapidly with increasing boost, and the velocity of the black hole\nplateaus at a value somewhat less than the speed of light for large boosts. Bowen-York initial data cannot produce\nblack holes moving at speeds arbitrarily close to the speed of light.\nA combination of boosts and displacements is necessary to construct initial data for binary black holes. In Section IV D, we first determine the radial boost opposite to the direction of the displacement necessary to cancel the\nradial momentum induced by the displacement. Orbital motion of a black hole in a binary system requires a transverse\nboost, and we verified in Table II that the relationship between the transverse boost and transverse momentum for\na displaced black hole is very nearly the same as the relation between boost and momentum for a centered boosted\nblack hole, as calculated in Section IV B. We also checked that the gravitational binding energy of two black holes at\nrest separated by about 10 times the total gravitational mass of the system agrees reasonably well with the Newtonian\nformula.\nFinally, we make a crude attempt to construct initial data for two black holes in circular orbits about the center\nof mass. Again, the black holes, with about a 2:1 mass ratio, are separated by a proper distance about 10 times the\ngravitational mass of the system. Boosts are assigned so that, considered individually, each black hole has zero radial\nmomentum and transverse momentum roughly as expected from a Newtonian analysis of the orbit. The black holes\nare also given close to maximal spins oriented in the plane of the orbit. The total energy, momentum, and angular\nmomentum of the system are calculated and displayed in Table III. The numerical results are consistent with the\ni\n/EBS values are rather small compared to the\nsystem linear momentum being close to zero, in that the system PBS\ni\nP\u0304 /M\u0304irr for each black hole. The component of the residual momentum along the line of the black hole displacements\n(the x-component) is considerably larger than the other components, suggesting that we should have taken account of\nthe black hole spins in estimating the radial boosts. The system angular momentum, including both spin and orbital\nangular momentum, is roughly consistent with Newtonian expectations. The two cases we present are designed to\nhave similar ratios of physical separation to black hole masses, but values of (K/3)MBS differing by about a factor\nof three. The ratio of the coordinate separation of the holes to R+ is three times larger in Case II than in Case I,\n\n\f19\nimplying correspondingly larger effects of the warping of the CMC hypersurface at the scale of the binary system.\nNonetheless, Case II achieves close to the same accuracy as Case I with half the number of collocation points in the\nouter spherical computational domain surrounding the two holes, 40 versus 80.\nThe exploratory analyses of conformally flat initial data on CMC hypersurfaces carried out in Ref. [1] and this paper\nneed to be extended in various ways to approach the current sophistication of initial data calculations on maximal\nhypersurfaces. In particular, it would be interesting to see how well the numerical techniques used here hold up when\nconsidering non-conformally-flat data, particularly when radiation is present at I \u0307 + . How well does the SpEC elliptic\nsolver handle the more complicated asymptotic behavior, including the polyhomogeneous terms in the conformal\nfactor and extrinsic curvature? This is important for implementing mixed hyperbolic-elliptic evolution systems. Also,\nquasi-equilibrium methods [28\u201330] based on the conformal-thin-sandwich approach to the initial data problem [31, 32]\nhave come to the fore in recent years as a way of obtaining quieter starts to binary black hole calculations, with less\njunk radiation and more circular initial orbits. It is clearly worthwhile to attempt to adapt these approaches to initial\ndata on CMC hypersurfaces. Can initial data for more Kerr-like black holes, as in Ref. [33], be constructed on CMC\nhypersurfaces? We hope to explore such issues in future papers.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge Harald Pfeiffer for helpful feedback, and for advice regarding the SpEC elliptic solver.\nJMB thanks the Perimeter Institute for their hospitality during the final stages of writing the paper.\nAppendix A: Analytic calculation of the partial Bondi-Sachs four-momentum from the conformal extrinsic\ncurvature\n\nThe Bondi-Sachs mass aspect for the conformally flat initial data is given in Eq. (46) as the sum of two terms,\none a coefficient in the expansion of the conformal factor away from I \u0307 + , and the other a projection \u0100RR of the\nconformal extrinsic curvature defined by Eq. (45). The first term requires solving a non-linear elliptic equation,\nwhich can only be done numerically. However, in the case of Bowen-York initial data on a conformally flat spatial\ngeometry, the conformal extrinsic curvature \u00c3ij is as given explicitly in Eq. (42). The angular integrals on I \u0307 + for\nthe \u0100RR contribution to the Bondi-Sachs mass and linear momentum will be obtained in analytic form with the help\nof Mathematica.\nFor a given black hole, we can rotate the Cartesian coordinates in the conformal flat space to locate the\nblack hole on the polar (positive z-) axis. The unit vector N normal to I \u0307+ has Cartesian components N i =\n(sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6, sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6, cos \u03b8). The displacement from the black hole location to a point on I \u0307 + has components\nri = (R+ sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6, R+ sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6, R+ cos \u03b8 \u2212 D) \u2261 rni ,\nwhere n is a unit vector. With q \u2261 D/R+ and x \u2261 cos \u03b8, the coordinate distance from the black hole to the point on\nI \u0307+ is\np\nr = R+ 1 + q 2 \u2212 2qx.\nThe scalar and vector products of the two unit vectors are\n1 \u2212 qx\n,\nN*n= p\n1 + q 2 \u2212 2qx\n\nq sin \u03b8\nN\u00d7n= p\n(\u2212 sin \u03c6, cos \u03c6, 0) .\n1 + q 2 \u2212 2qx\n\nThe direct contribution to the Bondi-Sachs mass aspect MA from the conformal extrinsic curvature is\n(MA )K = \u2212\n\n3\nK 3 k\n\u0100RR = \u2212 R+\nN \u00c3kl N l .\nK\n6\n\nSubstituting the expression in Eq.

(A2) and (A4) are only portions of the total Bondi-Sachs energy and momentum, respectively, so nothing can be concluded from these expressions about how the total Bondi-Sachs energy and momentum\ndepend on the Bowen-York parameters. In particular, the total Bondi-Sachs energy is always positive even when the\ntypically dominant first term in Eq. (A2) is negative. Also, note that a displaced \"Schwarzschild\" black hole (with no\nboosts or spin) has, according to our numerical results, a net linear momentum in the opposite direction from that\nimplied by the first term of Eq. (A4).\nAppendix B: Analytic calculation of total angular momentum\n\nFor conformally flat initial data on CMC hypersurfaces, the expression in Eq. (49) for the angular momentum at\n \u0307\nI + is just an angular integral over the conformal extrinsic curvature \u00c3lk , independent of the conformal factor \u03a9.\nThe generalized Bowen-York expression for \u00c3lk , as given in Eq. (42), is a simple sum over terms for each black hole,\neach of which contributes independently to the angular momentum. Therefore, we can consider each black hole and\neach term separately. For a given black hole, we can rotate the Cartesian coordinates in the conformal flat space to\nlocate the black hole with some displacement D from the origin to put it on the positive z-axis. The unit vector N\nnormal to this sphere at R = R+ , the unit vector n directed away from the black hole, and the coordinate distance r\nfrom the black hole to a point on I \u0307 + are given in Appendix A. Also note Eq. (A3) for the scalar and vector products\nof N and n. Define q \u2261 D/R+ and x \u2261 cos \u03b8.\nThe contribution from the first term in Eq.
