Introduction\nA hemisystem of lines of a generalized quadrangle of order (s2 , s) is a set H of lines such that every\npoint P is incident with (s + 1)/2 elements of H; that is, exactly half of the lines incident with each\npoint lie in H. The complementary set of lines to a hemisystem is also a hemisystem that may or may\nnot be equivalent under the automorphism group of the generalized quadrangle - if it is equivalent to\nits complement then we call it self-complementary. Hemisystems give rise to various other combinatorial\nobjects, including partial quadrangles (Cameron [7]), strongly regular graphs with certain parameters,\nand 4-class imprimitive cometric Q-antipodal association schemes1 that are not metric (see van Dam,\nMartin and Muzychuk [10]), all of which were thought to be somewhat rare.\nThe notion of a hemisystem was introduced in 1965 by Segre [21] in his work on regular systems of\nthe Hermitian surface, and he proved that there is a unique hemisystem of lines (up to equivalence) of\nthe classical generalized quadrangle H(3, 32 ). It was long thought that this was the only hemisystem\nin H(3, q 2 ) and indeed Thas [23] conjectured this as late as 1995. However, forty years after Segre's\nseminal paper, Cossidente and Penttila [9] constructed an infinite family of hemisystems of the classical\nquadrangles H(3, q 2 ) and other authors subsequently constructed sporadic examples in H(3, q 2 ) [5, 8] and\na single example in the non-classical generalized quadrangle FTWKB(5) (see [3]). The first main result\nof this paper extends the complete classification of hemisystems to the (known) generalized quadrangles\nof order (52 , 5).\nTheorem 1.1. A hemisystem of the classical generalized quadrangle H(3, 52 ) is equivalent to one of the\ntwo self-complementary hemisystems described in Table 7 and a hemisystem of the Fisher-Thas-WalkerKantor-Betten generalized quadrangle FTWKB(5) is equivalent to one of the three complementary pairs\ndescribed in Table 8.\nAll known generalized quadrangles of order (s2 , s), s odd, arise from flocks of the quadratic cone and\nhence are called flock generalized quadrangles. In [4] we gave a general construction for hemisystems that\nEmail addresses: John.Bamberg@uwa.edu.au (John Bamberg), Michael.Giudici@uwa.edu.au (Michael Giudici),\nGordon.Royle@uwa.edu.au (Gordon F.

In fact (as pointed\nout to us by Tim Penttila), our construction shows that the number of hemisystems in any infinite\nfamily of flock generalized quadrangles grows exponentially with the size of the generalized quadrangle.\nTherefore, far from being rare, hemisystems and their associated partial quadrangles, strongly regular\ngraphs etc. actually exist in great profusion. Of course this is an asymptotic result only, and so in this\ncompanion paper to [4], we consider hemisystems in the small (known) flock generalized quadrangles,\nnamely those of order (s2 , s) for all (odd) s 6 11. Using a mixture of computation and analysis driven by\nthe computational data, we discover large numbers of new hemisystems that do not arise from our general\nconstruction. Apart from the smallest generalized quadrangles, our searches all assume the existence of\nsome group of symmetries stabilising the hemisystem and so are necessarily incomplete.\nTable 1 summarises the results of our investigations, dividing the hemisystems into those of Type\nI arising from construction of [4] which we review in Section 3, and those that do not arise from this\nconstruction. In this table, notation of the form 6 \u00d7 2 + 2 is used to indicate that, up to equivalence under\nthe automorphism group of the generalized quadrangle, there are 6 complementary pairs of hemisystems\nand 2 self-complementary hemisystems, for a total of 14 hemisystems. In Theorem 3.3 we show that\na hemisystem of Type I in a generalized quadrangle of order (q 2 , q) is invariant under an elementary\nabelian group of order q 2 , so one way to verify that a hemisystem is not of Type I is to show that it is\nnot invariant under such a group.\nBy analysing the computational data for the classical generalized quadrangles H(3, q 2 ), we identify\npatterns that suggest the existence of three possible new infinite families of hemisystems. For these\ncandidate families, we extend the computations to higher values of q and, based on these computations,\nconjecture that just two of the three candidate families continue indefinitely. These families are discussed\nin Section 4.\nWe end the paper in Section 8 by discussing a number of questions and directions for future research\nsuggested by our results.\n2. Some basic background theory\nA generalized quadrangle is an incidence structure of points and lines such that if P is a point and l\nis a line not incident with P , then there is a unique line through P which meets l in a point. From this\nproperty, in the finite case, if there is a line containing at least three points or if there is a point on at\nleast three lines, then there are constants s and t such that each line is incident with s + 1 points, and\neach point is incident with t + 1 lines. Such a generalized quadrangle is said to have order (s, t), and its\npoint-line dual is a generalized quadrangle of order (t, s).\n2\n\n\fIn this paper we are concerned with generalized quadrangles of order (s2 , s), for s odd. The classical\nexample is the incidence structure of all points and lines of a non-singular Hermitian variety in PG(3, q 2 ),\nwhich forms the classical generalized quadrangle H(3, q 2 ) of order (q 2 , q) (see [17, 3.2.3]). Further examples\ncan be constructed from BLT-sets using the Knarr model. We briefly outline this construction below.\n2.1. Flocks of quadratic cones and BLT-sets\nA flock of the quadratic cone C with vertex v in PG(3, q) is a partition of the points of C\\{v} into\nconics. J. A. Thas [22] showed that a flock gives rise to an elation generalized quadrangle of order (q 2 , q),\nwhich we call a flock quadrangle. A BLT-set of lines of W(3, q) is a set O of q + 1 lines of W(3, q) such\nthat no line of W(3, q) is concurrent with more than two lines of O. In [1], it was shown that, for q odd,\na flock of a quadratic cone in PG(3, q) gives rise to a BLT-set of lines of W(3, q). Conversely, a BLT-set\ngives rise to possibly many flocks, however we only obtain one flock quadrangle up to isomorphism (see\n[16]).\nFor q odd, Knarr [13] gave a direct geometric construction of a flock quadrangle from a BLT-set of\nlines of W(3, q). Applying this construction to a linear BLT-set of lines (i.e., a regulus obtained from\nfield reduction of a Baer subline) of W(3, q), yields a generalized quadrangle isomorphic to the classical\nobject H(3, q 2 ).\nThe BLT-sets of lines of W(3, q) have been classified by Law and Penttila [15] for prime powers q\nat most 29, and this has recently been extended by Betten [6] to q 6 67. We outline the main infinite\nfamilies in Section 5.\n2.2. The Knarr model\nThe symplectic polar space W(5, q) of rank 3 is the geometry arising from taking the one-, two- and\nthree-dimensional vector subspaces of GF(q)6 for which a given alternating bilinear form restricts to the\nzero form (i.e., the totally isotropic subspaces). For example, one can take this alternating bilinear form\nto be defined by\n\u03b2(x, y) = x1 y6 \u2212 x6 y1 + x2 y5 \u2212 x5 y2 + x3 y4 \u2212 x4 y3 .\nIn particular \u03b2(x, y) = xJy T where\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nJ =\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\u22121\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\u22121\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n\u22121\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\nThis bilinear form also determines a null polarity \u22a5 of the ambient projective space PG(5, q), defined by\nU 7\u2192 U \u22a5 := {v \u2208 GF(q)6 : \u03b2(u, v) = 0 for all u \u2208 U }.\nThe ingredients of the Knarr construction are as follows:\n\u2022 a null polarity \u22a5 of PG(5, q);\n\u2022 a point P of PG(5, q);\n\u2022 a BLT-set of lines O of W(3, q).\nNote that the totally isotropic lines and planes incident with P yield the quotient polar space P \u22a5 /P\nisomorphic to W(3, q). So we will abuse notation and identify O with a set of totally isotropic planes on\nP . Then we construct a generalized quadrangle K(O) as in Table 2.\nWe now describe how the Knarr model leads to some obvious automorphisms of the resulting generalized quadrangle K(O). Let G be the semisimilarity group of the form \u03b2, that is, the group of all\nsemilinear transformations g of GF(q)6 for which there exists \u03bb \u2208 GF(q) and \u03c3 \u2208 Aut(GF(q)) such that\n\u03b2(ug , v g ) = \u03bb\u03b2(u, v)\u03c3 for all u, v \u2208 GF(q)6 . Let H be the group of similarities of \u03b2, that is, the group of\nall linear transformations that preserve \u03b2 up to a scalar. Then\nH = {A \u2208 GL(6, q) | AJAT = \u03bbJ for some \u03bb \u2208 GF(q)} \u223c\n= GSp(6, q).\n3\n\n\f(i)\n\n(ii)\n(iii)\n\nPoints\npoints of PG(5, q) not in P \u22a5\n\n(a)\n\nlines not incident with P but contained in\nsome element of O\nthe point P\n\n(b)\n\nLines\ntotally isotropic planes not contained in\nP \u22a5 and meeting some element of O in a\nline\nelements of O\n\nIncidence is inherited from that of PG(5, q).\nTable 2: Knarr model for a flock generalized quadrangle\n\nLet\n\uf8eb\n\n0\n0\n\uf8ec0\n0\n\uf8ec\nJ\u2032 = \uf8ec\n\uf8ed 0 \u22121\n\u22121 0\n\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n1\n0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n0\uf8f8\n\n0\n\nand take P to be the span of [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

In fact, if the flock quadrangle K(O) is\nnot classical, then these are the only automorphisms that you get, that is, Aut(K(O)) = E \u22ca \u0393Sp(4, q)O\n[18, IV.1 and IV.2]. (Note: In the paper [4] we incorrectly claimed that additional automorphisms could\narise for the Kantor-Knuth generalized quadrangles.)\n3. Hemisystems of Type I and their automorphisms\nIn this section we revise the construction given in [4] and discuss the stabiliser of the resulting hemisystems.\nLemma 3.1 (Bamberg, Giudici and Royle [4]). Consider a set O of totally isotropic planes of W(5, q)\neach incident with a point P such that {\u03c0/P : \u03c0 \u2208 O} is a BLT-set of lines of the quotient symplectic\nspace P \u22a5 /P \u223c\n= W(3, q). Let l be a line of W(3, q) not meeting any element of O. Define a binary relation\n\u2261l on O by setting \u03c0 \u2261l \u03c0 \u2032 if and only if\n\u03c0 = \u03c0\u2032\n\nor\n\n{hY, Y \u22a5 \u2229 \u03c0i | Y \u2208 l} \u2229 {hY, Y \u22a5 \u2229 \u03c0 \u2032 i | Y \u2208 l} = \u2205.\n\nThen \u2261l is an equivalence relation yielding a partition of O into two parts of equal size.\n4\n\n\fTheorem 3.2 (Bamberg, Giudici and Royle [4]). Consider a set O of totally isotropic planes of\nW(5, q) each incident with a point P such that {\u03c0/P : \u03c0 \u2208 O} is a BLT-set of lines of the quotient\nsymplectic space P \u22a5 /P \u223c\n= W(3, q). Suppose that we have a line l of W(5, q) not meeting any element of\nO, and let \u2261l be the binary relation on O defined in Lemma 3.1 with equivalence classes O+ and O\u2212 .\nLet S be a subset of the totally isotropic planes on l of size (q \u2212 1)/2, not containing hP, li, and let S c be\nthe complementary set of planes on l. Let\n+\n(i) L+\nin a line, and which meet some\nS be the totally isotropic planes that meet some element of O\nelement of S in a point; and\n\u2212\n(ii) L\u2212\nin a line, and which meet some\nS c be the totally isotropic planes that meet some element of O\nc\nelement of S in a point;\n\n\u2212\nThen O+ \u222a L+\nS \u222a LS c is a hemisystem of lines of K(O).\n\nRecall that Cossidente and Penttila showed that for each odd q, there exists a hemisystem Hq of\nH(3, q 2 ) admitting P\u03a9\u2212 (4, q). It was shown in [4] that these hemisystems could be constructed using\nTheorem 3.2. Moreover, the number of hemisystems produced by this construction grows exponentially\nwith q. To see this, note that the number\n\u221a of choices of (q \u2212 1)/2 things from q things is the binomial coef\u221a\n2q 2/\u03c0\nficient; asymptotically this has value \u221aq+1 , or basically, \u0398(2q / q). Whereas the automorphism group\nof the generalized quadrangle is polynomial in size and hence there are exponentially many inequivalent\nchoices.\nTheorem 3.3. Let H be the hemisystem exhibited in Theorem 3.2 and let G be the automorphism group\nof the generalized quadrangle K(O). Then GH contains T \u22ca Sp(4, q)O+ ,O\u2212 ,l\u2032 , where T is an elementary\nabelian group of order q 2 and l\u2032 is the line of W(3, q) obtained by projecting l onto P \u22a5 /P . The group T\nacts semiregularly on the set of lines of type (a) of K(O) and fixes each line of type (b).\nProof. Consider the group\n\uf8f1\uf8eb\n\uf8f4\n1\n\uf8f2\n\uf8ec\nE = \uf8edJ T aT\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nz\n\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f4\n0 0\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f7\n4\nI 0\uf8f8 a \u2208 GF(q) , z \u2208 GF(q)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\na 1\n\nwhich acts on the generalized quadrangle K(O).\nLet O be our BLT-set, considered as a set of lines in W(3, q). Each hu1 , u2 i \u2208 O is identified with the\n3-space hP, [0, u1 , 0], [0, u2 , 0]i in V . Note that\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n1\n0 0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n[0, u, 0] \uf8edJ T aT I 0\uf8f8 = [uJ T aT , u, 0]\nz\na 1\n\nHence E fixes each plane on P and hence each element of O. Moreover, given a line l in P \u22a5 that is\ndisjoint from every element of O, we have that E fixes hP, li. Now hP, li contains q 2 lines not on P . If\nwe take l\u2032 = h[0, w1 , 0], [0, w2 , 0]i to be a line on hl, P i we see that\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f1\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n1\n0 0\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\nEl\u2032 = \uf8edJ T aT I 0\uf8f8 z \u2208 GF(q), w 1 J T aT = w2 J T aT = 0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\n\uf8f3\nz\na 1\n\nwhich has order q 3 . Thus E acts transitively on the set of lines of hP, li not on P and so we may choose\nl = h[0, w1 , 0], [0, w2 , 0]i. We let l\u2032 = hw1 , w2 i, a totally isotropic line in W(3, q).\nLet R be the set of totally isotropic planes on l other than hP, li. Note that El fixes R setwise. These\nplanes are of the form hl, [x1 , 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]i with x1 \u2208 GF(q). Let T be the elementary abelian subgroup of\nEl of order q 2 consisting of all elements with z = 0. Then\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n1\n0 0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n[x1 , 0, 0, 0, 0, 1] \uf8edJ T aT I 0\uf8f8 = [x1 , a, 1]\n0\na 1\n5\n\n\fSince a \u2208 hw1 , w2 i\u22a5 = hw 1 , w2 i, it follows that [x1 , a, 1] \u2208 hl, [x1 , 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]i and so T fixes each element\nof R.\nLet S be a subset of size (q \u2212 1)/2 of R and S c be the complementary set of totally isotropic planes of\n\u2212\nsize (q + 1)/2. Then T fixes S and S c elementwise. Hence T fixes the hemisystem H = O+ \u222a L+\nS \u222a LS c .\nLet B \u2208 Sp(4, q)O and consider the element\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1\n01\u00d74\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nX = \uf8ed04\u00d71\nB\n04\u00d71 \uf8f8\n0\n01\u00d74\n1\n\nwhich acts on the flock generalized quadrangle K(O). If B \u2208 Sp(4, q)O+ ,O\u2212 ,l\u2032 then X fixes each element\n\u2212\nof R setwise and hence stabilises the hemisystem O+ \u222a L+\nS \u222a LS c . Thus T \u22ca Sp(4, q)O + ,O \u2212 ,l\u2032 6 GH .\nThe lines of K(O) are the elements of O and the totally isotropic planes not on P and meeting\nsome element of O in a line. We have seen already that T fixes each of the elements of O. Now let\nU = hP, [0, u1 , 0], [0, u2 , 0]i \u2208 O and recall that hu1 , u2 i \u2229 hw 1 , w2 i = {0}. Then\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f1\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n1\n0 0\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec T T\nT T\nT T\nTh[0,u1 ,0],[0,u2 ,0]i = \uf8edJ a\nI 0\uf8f8 \u2208 T u1 J a = u2 J a = 0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\n\uf8f3\n0\na 1\n\nSince such elements lie in T they also satisfy w 1 J T aT = w2 J T aT = 0. If a 6= 0, we have {x | xJ T aT = 0}\nhas dimension 3 but contains the complementary 2-spaces hu1 , u2 i and hw 1 , w2 i. This is a contradiction\nand so Th[0,u1 ,0],[0,u2 ,0]i = 1. Thus T acts regularly on the q 2 lines in U not containing P , and hence acts\nsemiregularly on the totally isotropic planes not on P and meeting some element of O in a line.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.4. The stabiliser GH can be larger than the group given by Theorem 3.3. Sometimes extra\nautomorphisms can arise from the structure of the Knarr model. For example, if S were chosen to be\n{hl, [x2 , 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]i | x \u2208 GF(q)} then the elements\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u03bb\n01\u00d74\n0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed04\u00d71 I4\u00d74 04\u00d71 \uf8f8\n0\n01\u00d74 \u03bb\u22121\n\nwill fix H. Similarly, suitable choices of S may give rise to semisimilarities of \u03b2 that stabilise H.\nAlternatively, H(3, q 2 ) has more automorphisms than those arising from the Knarr model.\nCossidente-Penttila hemisystems in these generalized quadrangles admit at least P\u03a3L(2, q 2 ).\n\nThe\n\n4. Potential new infinite families of hemisystems of H(3, q 2 )\nExamination of our computational data uncovered three promising candidates for new infinite families\nof hemisystems of H(3, q 2 ), and in this section we investigate these possible families in more detail.\n4.1. Hemisystems that are invariant under a Singer type element\nIn this section, we present a way of viewing hemisystems of H(3, q 2 ) that are invariant under a Singer\ntype element, and we give some computational data which shows the existence of such hemisystems for all\nq 6 29, except (curiously) q \u2208 {13, 25}. For q = 3 we obtain the Segre hemisystem, for q = 5 we obtain\nthe hemisystem invariant under (3 * A7 ).2 discovered by Cossidente and Penttila [9] and for q = 7, 9 the\nexamples are given in [5]. In what follows, we will work in the dual generalized quadrangle; the points\nand lines of the elliptic quadric Q\u2212 (5, q). A hemisystem of lines of H(3, q 2 ) transfers to a hemisystem of\npoints of Q\u2212 (5, q).\nWe begin with GF(q 6 ) and equip it with the following bilinear form over GF(q):\n3\n\nB(x, y) := Trq6 \u2192q (xy q ).\n6\n\n\f2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n(Note that Trq6 \u2192q is the relative trace map x 7\u2192 x + xq + xq + xq + xq + xq ). This form is symmetric\n3\nand defines an elliptic orthogonal space isomorphic to Q\u2212 (5, q). Now let \u03c9 = \u03be (q \u22121)(q+1) where \u03be is a\nprimitive element of GF(q 6 ). Let K = h\u03c9i and note that K is independent of the choice of \u03be (it is just\n2\nthe set of elements x such that xq \u2212q+1 = 1). Then K is irreducible and acts semiregularly on the totally\nisotropic points of Q\u2212 (5, q), and is occasionally known as a Singer type isometry of Q\u2212 (5, q). So the\nnumber of orbits of K on totally isotropic points is (q + 1)2 . It is not difficult to see that each point orbit\nis of the form\n2\n{hui | u(q \u2212q+1)(q\u22121) = r},\nwhere r is a singular element of GF(q 6 )\u2217 such that r(q+1) \u2208 GF(q 3 ). In what follows, we will use the\nunderlying vectors instead of the projective points as the equations will be simpler. Note that the Korbits on singular nonzero vectors are each of the form\n{u \u2208 GF(q 6 )\u2217 | uq\n\n2\n\n\u2212q+1\n\n= r},\n\nr\u2208R\n\nwhere\nR := {r \u2208 GF(q 6 ) | rq+1 \u2208 GF(q 3 ), Trq6 \u2192q (rq+1 ) = 0}.\nThe elements of R lie on the mutually disjoint lines\n2\n\nla : X q \u2212 aX = 0\nwhere a is an element of GF(q 3 ) such that aq+1 + a + 1 = 0.\nSo to construct a hemisystem, we need to construct a set of 21 (q+1)2 elements of R. Of the hemisystems\n2\nwe found, all were invariant under the field automorphism \u03c4 : a 7\u2192 aq fixing GF(q 2 ) elementwise, and it\nacts on the set of lines {la }. The orbits of h\u03c4 i on {la } are the zero sets of the GF(q 2 )-irreducible factors\nof the polynomial X q+1 + X + 1. Now every element r \u2208 R can be uniquely represented by the pair\n2\n3\n2\n(rq \u22121 , rq \u22121 ). The possible values of rq \u22121 are the q + 1 zeros of X q+1 + X + 1, and the possible values\n3\nof rq \u22121 are the q + 1 solutions to X q+1 = 1; let this latter set be denoted by N . So a h\u03c4 i-orbit on R is\nuniquely determined by a GF(q 2 )-irreducible factor i(X) of X q+1 + X + 1 and an element n \u2208 N :\n{r \u2208 R : i(rq\n\n2\n\n\u22121\n\n) = 0, rq\n\n3\n\n\u22121\n\n= n}.\n\nThe hemisystems we construct arise from unions of these orbits.\nBelow we list the hemisystems that we found for 3 6 q 6 9. In each table we describe each solution\nby unions of h\u03c4 i-orbits on R. The constituents of these unions are described by which values of N appear\nas right-hand values for each i(X).\nExample 4.1. For q = 3, N = {1, \u22121, z 2, z 6 }, where z is the primitive root of GF(q 2 ). The GF(q 2 )irreducible factors of X q+1 + X + 1 are\ni1 (X) : X \u2212 1\n\ni2 (X) : X 3 + X 2 + X \u2212 1.\n\nand\n\nLet \u03a0 be the subset of the ordered pairs {i1 , i2 } \u00d7 N described by specifying the right-hand coordinates per\npossible left-hand coordinate:\nX \u22121\n3\nX + X2 + X \u2212 1\nNow let\nR\nH\u03a0\n:= {r \u2208 R | i(rq\n\n2\n\n\u22121\n\n1, z 6\n\u22121, z 2\n\n) = 0, (i(X), rq\n\n\u2212\n\n3\n\n\u22121\n\n) \u2208 \u03a0}.\n\nThen our hemisystem of points of Q (5, q) is simply\no\nn\n2\nR\n.\nH\u03a0 := hui | u(q \u2212q+1)(q\u22121) \u2208 H\u03a0\n\nMoreover, we know that H\u03a0 is projectively equivalent to the Segre hemisystem.\n7\n\n\fIn each case below, z denotes the primitive element of GF(q 2 ).

Does there exist a hemisystem invariant under a Singer type element for all odd prime\npowers q 6\u2261 1 (mod 12)?\n4.2. Hemisystems invariant under the stabiliser of a triangle: tyranny of the small?\nAnother interesting sequence of hemisystems apparent in our data is that for q = 7, 9 and 11, the\n2\ngeneralized quadrangle H(3, q 2 ) contains a hemisystem invariant under a group K = Cq+1\n: S3 . In fact,\nfor q = 9 and 11 there are several such hemisystems. Moreover, the stabiliser of the Segre hemisystem\nfor q = 3 contains such a subgroup, as does the group (3 * A7 ).2 for q = 5.\nThe group K can be realised as follows. The stabiliser of a nondegenerate hyperplane of H(3, q 2 )\n3\ncontains a group H \u223c\n: (S3 \u00d7 C2f ) where q = pf that fixes a set T of mutually orthogonal\n= Cq+1\nnondegenerate points {hv1 i, hv2 i, hv3 i} of the underling projective space. In particular, taking v1 , v2 , v3 as\nthe first three elements of a basis of the underlying vector space, the pointwise stabiliser in PGU(4, q) of\nT is the group D of all diagonal matrices diag(\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , \u03bb3 , 1) such that \u03bbq+1\n= \u03bbq+1\n= \u03bbq+1\n= 1. Letting\n1\n2\n3\n\u03c3 and \u03c4 be the permutation matrices such that \u03c3 : v1 7\u2192 v2 7\u2192 v3 7\u2192 v1 and \u03c4 : v1 7\u2192 v1 , v2 7\u2192 v3 7\u2192 v1 ,\nwe P\nhave h\u03c3, \u03c4 iP\u223c\n= S3 . Moreover, H = D : (h\u03c3, \u03c4 i \u00d7 h\u03c6i) where \u03c6 is the field automorphism such that\n2\n\u03c6:\n\u03bbi vi 7\u2192 \u03bbpi vi . The group H contains a normal subgroup R isomorphic to Cq+1\ngiven by\nR := {diag(\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , \u03bb3 , 1) | \u03bbq+1\n= 1, \u03bb1 \u03bb2 \u03bb3 = 1}.\ni\n8\n\n\fThe group K that leaves invariant a hemisystem for the values of q examined is R\u22cah\u03c3, diag(\u03bb, \u03bb, \u03bb, 1)\u03c4 \u03c6f i\nwhere \u03bb is an element of order q + 1.\nSo naturally we may ask if there exists a hemisystem of H(3, q 2 ) invariant under K for all q? For\nq = 13 and q = 17, we constructed the group K and, as anticipated, found hemisystems stabilised by\nK, but to our surprise the sequence appears to stop there and for q = 19, 23, 25 and 27 there are no\nhemisystems stabilised by K. (We were sufficiently surprised by this that we ran the linear program with\na second integer programming package - GLPK - in addition to Gurobi.)\n4.3. Hemisystems invariant under 24 .A5\nA further interesting sequence is that for H(3, 72 ) and H(3, 112 ) there is a hemisystem with stabiliser\nof shape 24 .A5 . The stabiliser of the Segre hemisystem for q = 3 also contains such a subgroup, and\nfurther calculations have verified the existence of a hemisystem invariant under 24 .A5 when q = 19. The\ngroup PGU(3, q) contains a subgroup H isomorphic to 24 .A6 for all q \u2261 3 (mod 4) (such a subgroup is\nusually referred to as a C6 -group, or the normaliser of a symplectic type r-group, see for example [12,\n\u00a74.6]). The group H contains two groups of shape 24 .A5 , corresponding to the two classes of A5 in A6 .\nThe group which arises as a stabiliser of a hemisystem for q = 3, 7, 11 and 19 is the one for which the A5\nacts transitively on the nontrivial elements of the 24 .\nProblem 4.3. Is there a hemisystem of H(3, q 2 ) invariant under 24 .A5 for all q \u2261 3 (mod 4)?\nThese hemisystems are especially intriguing (and also potentially harder to search for) as the order\nof their stabiliser is constant.\n5. BLT-sets\nIn this section, we list some of the known families of BLT-sets. Suppose we are in the 3-dimensional\nsymplectic space W(3, q) defined by the form \u03b2(x, y) = x1 y4 \u2212 x4 y1 + x2 y3 \u2212 x3 y2 . Then from Payne's\nq-clans (see [19]) we can construct BLT-sets of W(3, q). For the following, we note that a quadratic form\nQ over GF(q) is anisotropic if Q(x) = 0 holds only when x = 0. The following lemma is straight-forward\nto prove (see [2, p. 296]).\nLemma 5.1. Consider the following lines L of W(3, q):\n!\n1 0 ft\n0 0 1 0\nl\u221e :=\n, lt :=\n0 0 0 1\n0 1 gt\n\nt\nft\n\n!\n\nfor all t \u2208 GF(q).\n\nThen L is a BLT-set of lines of W(3, q) if and only if for all t, u \u2208 GF(q), t 6= u, the following quadratic\nform on GF(q)2 \u2295 GF(q)2 is anisotropic:\n(x, y) 7\u2192 (t \u2212 u)x2 + 2(ft \u2212 fu )xy + (gt \u2212 gu )y 2 .\nWe now summarise the maps f and g that generate the flock quadrangles used in this paper.

Consider the\ndual generalized quadrangle of W(3, q), the points and lines of the parabolic quadric Q(4, q). So a BLT-set\nof lines of W(3, q) corresponds to a BLT-set of points of Q(4, q). Consider V := GF(q 2 ) \u2295 GF(q 2 ) \u2295 GF(q)\nas a vector space over GF(q), and define the following quadratic form on V :\n(x, y, a) 7\u2192 xq+1 + y q+1 + a2 .\nThis quadratic form defines a parabolic quadric Q isomorphic to Q(4, q).\nThe following models were taken from [14].\nThe Fisher BLT-sets:\nFix an element \u03b2 \u2208 GF(q 2 ) with \u03b2 q+1 = \u22121. Let\nP = {(\u03b2x2 , 0, 1) | xq+1 = 1} \u222a {(0, \u03b2y 2 , 1) | y q+1 = 1}.\nThen P defines a BLT-set of points of Q.\nThe Penttila-Mondello BLT-sets:\nSuppose q \u2261 \u00b11 (mod 10) and fix \u03b2, \u03b3 \u2208 GF(q 2 ) satisfying \u03b2 q+1 = \u2212 54 and \u03b3 q+1 = \u2212 51 . Let\nP = {(\u03b2x2 , \u03b3x3 , 1) | xq+1 = 1}.\nThen P is a BLT-set of points of Q. For PM(11), we may use a representation as in Lemma 5.1 given by\nthe functions ft and gt in Table 5.\nt\nft\ngt\n\n0\n8\n1\n\n1\n0\n8\n\n2\n7\n3\n\n3\n4\n2\n\n4\n8\n5\n\n5\n0\n6\n\n6\n1\n10\n\n7\n5\n9\n\n8\n0\n4\n\n9\n0\n7\n\n10\n0\n0\n\nTable 5: The functions ft and gt for PM(11)\n\n6. Computational methods\nThe point-line incidence matrix of a generalized quadrangle is the matrix A with rows indexed by\npoints and columns by lines such that\n(\n1, P is on l;\nAP,l =\n0, otherwise.\nIn order to construct the point-line incidence matrix of a flock generalized quadrangle, we used the GAP\npackage FinInG2 . This software can construct flock generalized quadrangles from the information given in\nSection 5.\nA hemisystem is a subset of the columns of A that sum to (s + 1)/2 j T where j is the all-ones (row)\nvector or, equivalently, a {0, 1}-vector h such that\nAhT = (s + 1)/2 j T .\n\n(1)\n\nFor all but the smallest generalized quadrangles, the matrix A is so large that we cannot hope to solve\nthe equations completely. To reduce the problem, we assume the existence of some group G stabilizing\nthe hemisystem. Suppose that G has orbits {P1 , P2 , . . . , Pm } on points and {L1 , L2 , . . . , Ln } on lines.\n2 This\n\ncan be found at http://cage.ugent.be/geometry/fining.php. This package is currently in development.\n\n10\n\n\fThen every point in a point-orbit Pi is incident with the same number of lines in the line-orbit Lj . If we\ndenote this number by bij and define the m \u00d7 n matrix B = (bij ), then a {0, 1}-vector h such that\nBhT = (s + 1)/2 j T\n\n(2)\n\ndetermines a hemisystem that is stabilised by the group G.\nThere are a variety of approaches to solving equations such as (2). In particular, the system of\nequations can be viewed either as an integer linear program or as a constraint satisfaction problem.\nAfter experimenting with software for each type of problem, we determined that the commercial integer\nprogramming package Gurobi [11] (available with a free academic license) was the most effective for our\npurposes.\nA linear program attempts to find values for variables x1 , x2 , . . . , xn that maximise (or minimise) a\nlinear objective function subject to linear constraints. An integer linear program, or just integer program,\nis a linear program with the additional restriction that the variables must take integral values. Solving\n(2) does not involve any maximizing or minimizing and so the objective function can be taken to be\na constant, say 0, and then any feasible solution x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) to the following integer program\nyields a hemisystem:\nMaximise:\n0\nsubject to: BxT = (s + 1)/2 j T\nxi \u2208 {0, 1}.\nIn order to find all the solutions to a given system of equations, the system is augmented as each\nsolution is found with an additional constraint excluding that particular solution, and the system is then\nre-solved. When all the solutions have been found and excluded, the resulting system has no integer\nfeasible solutions. In order to exclude a particular solution h = (h1 , h2 , . . . , hn ) it suffices to add a\nconstraint of the form\nX\nX\nhi\nxi <\n{i|hi =1}\n\ni\n\nwhich merely says that x cannot agree with h in every coordinate position, and so must differ in at least\none place. In principle, a constraint of this form only eliminates vectors identical to h and still permits\nthe solver to investigate vectors that have almost all of their entries identical to h. However, if we know\nan upper bound, say \u03b1, on the size of the intersection of two hemisystems, then we can strengthen this\nconstraint to\nX\nxi 6 \u03b1\n(3)\n{i|hi =1}\n\nwithout missing any hemisystems. The exhaustive search for hemisystems in H(3, 52 ) was made feasible\nby using two basic techniques to shorten the search time:\n\u2022 Use the automorphism group of H(3, 52 ) to determine the largest possible set of lines that can freely\nbe assumed to be in a hemisystem.\n\u2022 Use knowledge of the possible intersection sizes of a hemisystem with the two known hemisystems\nto add strong constraints of the same type as (3) during the search.\nA more detailed description of the computation for H(3, 52 ) follows:\nProof of Theorem 1.1 for H(3, 52 ).\nLet G be the full automorphism group of H(3, 52 ) and let H be a hemisystem. As G is transitive on\nthe set of lines of H(3, 52 ) we can assume without loss of generality that l1 \u2208 H. Then the stabiliser Gl1\nhas two orbits on the remaining lines, those disjoint from l1 and those that meet l1 . It is easy to see\nthat any hemisystem containing l1 must contain a line disjoint from l1 and so we can arbitrarily pick a\nsecond line, say l2 , and assume without loss of generality that l1 , l2 \u2208 H. This process can be continued\nin a semi-automated fashion as follows: suppose that we have a set l1 , . . . , li of lines that we can already\nassume are contained in H, and consider the orbits of the setwise stabiliser G{l1 ,...,li } on lines. An orbit\nO is denoted essential if a search for a hemisystem that contains l1 , . . . , li but does not contain any\n11\n\n\fline from O is infeasible. If O is essential, then H contains at least one line from O, and we can select\nli+1 arbitrarily from O. This process can be continued until the set of lines is sufficiently large that its\nstabiliser is so small that it has no essential orbits. In this fashion, we found a particular set of 8 lines\nl1 , . . . , l8 that can be assumed to lie in H.\nThe next important step was to determine that no hemisystem has a \"large\" intersection with either\nof the two known hemisystems. Let H1 and H2 be representatives of the two known hemisystems. First\nwe found the maximum possible size in which any hemisystem (known or unknown) can intersect H1\nby running the integer linear program where the objective function to be maximised is the sum of the\nvariables corresponding to the lines in H1 . This revealed that a hemisystem different from H1 can\nintersect H1 in at most 306 lines. By running the linear program again with the additional constraint\nthat the intersection with H1 has size exactly 306, we determined all the hemisystems that intersect H1\nin 306 lines and confirmed that no new hemisystems arose. We repeated this process with the \"next\nlargest\" intersection, which proved to be size 300, then 282, then 270 and then 258, eventually confirming\nthat any hemisystem that meets H1 in 258 or more lines is isomorphic to either H1 or H2 . Similar results\nwere obtained for H2 and similarly we determined that any hemisystem meeting H2 in 258 or more lines\nis isomorphic to H1 or H2 .\nFinally, the exhaustive search is run where the variables corresponding to l1 , . . . , l8 are initially set to\n1 and every time a hemisystem is found, it is excluded by adding a constraint similar to (3) with \u03b1 = 257.\nNotice that this constraint is much stronger than simply excluding the hemisystem that has just been\nfound and will exclude other hemisystems. However if the just-found hemisystem is one of the two known\nones, then the \"extra\" hemisystems that are excluded by the constraint are necessarily isomorphic to the\nknown ones, and hence not of interest. Therefore if unknown hemisystems do exist, then at least one\nof them will be discovered by the search. As this does not occur, we conclude that there are no other\nhemisystems of H(3, 52 ).\n\u0003\nIn this computation, there is a trade-off involved in choosing the value 258 used in the constraints\nto exclude solutions as they are found. Using a lower value would make the final exhaustive part of the\nsearch run faster, but it would take longer to establish that only known hemisystems intersect H1 or H2\nin that many lines.\nThe computation for FTWKB(5) was done in an exactly analogous fashion.\n7. A summary of the known hemisystems of flock quadrangles\nIn this section we catalogue all the known hemisystems of lines of flock quadrangles of order (s2 , s) for\ns 6 11. These include those which arise in the pre-existing literature, those obtained via Theorem 3.2, and\nnumerous further examples constructed by computer. Each row of the table describes a complementary\npair of hemisystems; the column SC (for \"self-complementary\") indicates whether the hemisystem is\nequivalent to its complement in which case it contributes just 1 to the total count of hemisystems.\nThe tables contain an exhaustive listing of all the hemisystems that arise by Theorem 3.2 and are\ncomplete for the known generalized quadrangles of order up to (52 , 5). However there may be many more\nhemisystems, though necessarily with small automorphism groups, that remain to be found.\nProposition 7.1. Let H be a hemisystem of a flock quadrangle of order (s2 , s) with s 6 9 such that H\narises from Theorem 3.2. Then H appears in one of the tables in this section.\nWe also list all hemisystems arising from Theorem 3.2 for H(3, 112 ) in Table 14. Due to the large\nnumber of hemisystems of Type I for the remaining flock quadrangles of order (112 , 11), they are listed\nin the Appendix, which is only included in the version of this paper on the arxiv.\nReconstruction of the hemisystems from the data\nThe data given for the Type I hemisystems in our tables is sufficient to reconstruct the\nactual hemisystem given some additional knowledge about the particular choices that\nhave been made for the variables in the construction. First of all, the finite fields in GAP\nhave a determined primitive element and the ordering of the elements of the field is first\n12\n\n\fgraded by towers of subfields, and then by exponents of the primitive element. Matrices\nin GAP are ordered lexicographically, row by row. The point P is (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) and the\nBLT-sets are the ones given in Section 5. Each totally isotropic plane can be represented\nuniquely by a 3 \u00d7 6 matrix written in Hermite normal form, whose row space gives us\nthe corresponding 3-dimensional vector subspace. The totally isotropic planes on l are\nsorted by sorting the corresponding 3 \u00d7 6 matrices into lexicographic order, and indexed\nby {1, . . . , q + 1}. The chosen subset S is given by a (q \u2212 1)/2 subset of this index set.\n7.1.

Open Problems\nWe saw in Section 3 that in any infinite family of generalized quadrangles of order (q 2 , q) the number\nof hemisystems arising from Theorem 3.2 grows exponentially in q. Hemisystems that do not arise from\nTheorem 3.2 are then of particular interest.\nProblem 8.1. Does every flock generalized quadrangle of order (s2 , s) with s > 7 contain a hemisystem\nthat does not arise from Theorem 3.2?\nWe have found such hemisystems in all of the generalized quadrangles that we have examined with the\nexception of the small cases (H(3, 32 ) and H(3, 52 )) and FTWKB(11).\nAlthough we have outlined two possibilities for infinite families of hemisystems in H(3, q 2 ) in Section\n4, we do not have any proven general constructions for hemisystems other than Theorem 3.2.\nProblem 8.2. Find a natural construction for an infinite family of hemisystems (not of Type I) in\nH(3, q 2 ) or in one of the known families of non-classical generalized quadrangles.\nBy Theorem 3.3, a hemisystem coming from Theorem 3.2 is invariant under a particular elementary\nabelian group of order q 2 denoted by T . However, we do not know if the converse is true.\nProblem 8.3. Are there hemisystems invariant under the elementary abelian group T of order q 2 described in Theorem 3.3 that do not arise from Theorem 3.2?\n3 Due\n\nto its size, this Appendix is only included in the arxiv version of this paper\n\n17\n\n\fAt the other end of the symmetry spectrum, we currently do not know of any hemisystems with a\ntrivial group. However this is not surprising, as almost all of our searches have assumed the existence of\nsymmetries.\nProblem 8.4. Is there a hemisystem with trivial group?\nWe expect a positive answer, although it may be challenging to find such a hemisystem.\nEach hemisystem gives a strongly regular graph and the stabiliser of the hemisystem in the automorphism group of the generalized quadrangle gives a group of automorphisms of the strongly regular graph.\nIn all cases investigated so far, the automorphism group of the strongly regular graph is induced by the\nstabiliser of the hemisystem in the automorphism group of the generalized quadrangle. It is not apparent\nwhy this should always be the case.\nProblem 8.5. Is the full automorphism group of the strongly regular graph obtained from a hemisystem always induced by the stabiliser of the hemisystem in the automorphism group of the generalized\nquadrangle?\nProblem 8.6. Are there hemisystems in different generalized quadrangles whose associated strongly regular graphs are isomorphic?\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are extremely grateful to Simon Guest for his computational assistance.\n[1] Laura Bader, Guglielmo Lunardon, and Joseph A.
