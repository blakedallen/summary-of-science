INTRODUCTION\nRecently, trying to understand the generic features that characterize the formation and topology of\ncomplex networks, much work has been devoted to the study of a large-scale complex system\ndescribed by a network or a graph with complex topology, whose nodes are the elements of the system\nand whose edges represent the interactions among them. For example, the topology of the Internet can\nbe studied at two different granularities. At the router level, each router is a node and two nodes are\njoined by a link when they are physically tied together. At the inter-domain level, each domain\n(subnetwork) is represented by a single node and each inter-domain interconnection is an edge [1]. In\nthe case of the World Wide Web (WWW), the nodes are Web sites and they are joined when there is a\nhyper-link from one to the other [2-6]. Cell functioning is guaranteed by a complex metabolic network,\nin which the nodes are substrates and enzymes and the edges represent chemical interactions [7]. Even\ncitations of scientific papers can be viewed as a network, where the nodes are papers and the edges\ncorrespond to citations among different papers [8]. The human society can be characterized by a huge\nsocial network, in which a node is an individual, an organization, or a country, connected by social\ninteractions [9].\n\nThe apparent ubiquity of networks leads to a fascinating set of common problems concerning how\nnetwork structure facilitates and constraints network behaviors. However, due to the large size and the\ncomplexity of interactions of such networks, it has become possible only very recently to gather and\nanalyze the huge amount of data from such intricate systems due to the availability of modern\ncomputing power. It is expected that such topological information will be increasingly available and,\nthus, raise the possibility of understanding the topological and dynamical properties of very large-scale\nand complex networks in such a way that the study is based on real data, rather than just simulated and\nidealized information.\n\nTraditionally, a network of complex topology is described by a random graph, for example, the graph\nof Erdos and Renyi (ER) [10-11]. Recently, in order to describe the transition from a regular network to\na random network, Watts and Strogatz (WS) introduced the so-called small-world network [12-13]. A\n\n2\n\n\fcommon feature of the ER model and the WS model is that the connectivity distribution of the network\npeaks at an average value and decays exponentially. Such an exponential network is homogeneous in\nnature: each node has roughly the same number of connections.\n\nOne significant recent discovery in the field of complex networks is the observation that a number of\nlarge-scale and complex networks are scale-free, that is, their connectivity distributions have the\npower-law form. This includes the above examples, as discussed in [14-15]. A scale-free network is\ninhomogeneous in nature: most nodes have very few connections and only a small number of nodes\nhave many connections. It is this inhomogeneous feature that makes a scale-free network error tolerant\nbut vulnerable to attacks [16-19]. More precisely, the connectivity of such networks is highly robust\nagainst random failures, that is, random removal of nodes (for example, random failures of routers in\nthe Internet), but it is also extremely fragile to attacks, that is, specific removal of the most highly\nconnected nodes. This may help explain why the Internet chugs right along despite frequent router\nfailures. On the other hand, the average performance of the Internet would be cut in half if just 1% of\nthe most highly connected routers were incapacitated. The Internet will even lose its integrity with 4%\nof its most important routers being destroyed. This is known as the 'Achilles heel' of the Internet [1617].\n\nConnectivity is a topological property of networks. To better investigate the dynamical behaviors of\ncomplex networks, one may extend the existed scale-free network models by introducing dynamical\nelements into the network nodes. One of the most significant and interesting properties of a dynamical\nnetwork is the synchronization motion of its dynamical elements. Synchronization has long been a\nbasic concept in science and technology [20]. The ability of coupled oscillators to synchronize each\nother is a basis for the explanation of many processes of nature. In particular, synchronization in a\nnetwork of coupled chaotic systems has recently become a topic of great interest [21-25]. This work is\nan effort devoted to the study of the synchronizability of a scale-free dynamical network, to show that\nit is robust against random removal of nodes, and yet is fragile to specific removal of the most highly\nconnected nodes.\n\n3\n\n\fII. THE SCALE-FREE DYNAMICAL NETWORK MODEL\n\nA. A Scale-Free Network Model\nBarab\u00e1si and Albert suggested that two ingredients of self-organization of a network in a scale-free\nstructure are growth and preferential attachment [14-15]. These refer to that networks continuously\ngrow by the addition of new nodes and new nodes are preferentially attached to existing nodes with\nhigh numbers of connections (the so-called 'rich get richer' phenomena).\n\nIn the present paper, a simple scale-free model of Barabasi and Albert is adopted. The model starts with\n\nm0 nodes. At every time step, a new node is introduced, which is connected to m already-existing\nnodes. The probability\n\n\u03a0 i that the new node is connected to node i depends on the degree k i of node\n\ni such that \u03a0 i =\n\n\u2211 j k j . For large time, the probability P(k ) that a node in the network is\n\nconnected to\n\nk\n\nki\n\nother nodes decays in a power-law of the form\n\nP( k ) = 2m 2 / k 3 [14]. As a side\n\nnote, Albert and Barabasi recently proposed an extended model of network evolution that gives a more\nrealistic description of local processing, taking into account the additions of new nodes and new links,\nand the rewiring of links [26].\n\nB. The Scale-Free Dynamical Network Model\nNow suppose that at sometime, the scale-free network consists of\ncoupled nodes, with each node being a\n\nN\n\nidentical linearly and diffusive\n\nn -dimensional dynamical system. The state equations of the\n\nnetwork are\nN\n\nx& i = f ( x i ) + c \u2211 a ij\u0393( x j \u2212 x i ) i = 1, 2, L, N\n\n(1)\n\nj =1\nj \u2260i\n\nwhere\n\nx i = ( xi1 , xi 2 , L , x in ) \u2208 R n are the state variables of node i , the constant c > 0\n\nrepresents the coupling strength and\nFor simplicity, we assume that\n\n\u0393 \u2208 R n\u00d7 n is a constant 0 \u2212 1 matrix linking coupled variables.\n\n\u0393 = diag ( r1 , r2 , L , rn ) is a diagonal matrix with ri = 1 for a\n\n4\n\n\fparticular\n\ni and r j = 0 for j \u2260 i . This means that two coupled nodes are linked through their ith\n\nstate variables. If there is a connection between node\notherwise,\n\ni and node j ( i \u2260 j ), then a ij = a ji = 1 ;\n\na ij = a ji = 0 ( i \u2260 j ).\n\nk i of node i is defined to be the number of connection incidents on node i , then\n\nIf the degree\n\nN\n\n\u2211a\nj =1\nj\u2260 i\n\nN\n\nij\n\n= \u2211 a ji = k i , i = 1, 2, L, N .\n\n(2)\n\nj =1\nj \u2260i\n\nLet\n\na ii = \u2212k i , i = 1, 2, L, N .\n\n(3)\n\nThen equations (1) can be written as\nN\n\nx& i = f ( x i ) + c\u2211 a ij \u0393x j , i = 1, 2, L, N\n\n(4)\n\nj =1\n\nCoupling matrix\n\nA = ( a ij ) \u2208 R N \u00d7 N represents the coupling configuration of the network. Suppose\n\nthat the network is connected in the sense that there are no isolate clusters. Then the coupling matrix\n\nA = ( a ij ) N \u00d7 N is a symmetric irreducible matrix. In this case, it can be shown that zero is an\neigenvalue of\n\nThe ith row\n\nA with multiplicity 1 and all the other eigenvalues of A are strictly negative.\n\na (i ,:) and ith column a (:, i ) of matrix A will be called as the ith row-column pair of\n\nA . Equations (2) and (3) together implies that\nN\n\na(i , :) 1 = a (:, i ) 1 \u2261 \u2211 | a ji |= 2k i\n\n(5)\n\nj =1\n\nThe power-law connectivity distribution makes a scale-free network extremely inhomogeneous: the\nmajority of nodes are 'small' nodes with very small degrees, while a few nodes are 'big' nodes with\nvery high degrees. This, in turn, implies that most row-column pairs of the coupling matrix have small\n1-norms and a few row-column pairs have large 1-norms.\n\n5\n\n\fIII. SYNCHRONIZATION IN SCALE-FREE DYNAMICAL NETWORKS\n\nA. Synchronization Stability Analysis\nLet\n\ns( t ) \u2208 R n be a solution of an isolate node, i.e.,\ns&( t ) = f (s( t ))\n\nHere\n\n(6)\n\ns (t ) can be an equilibrium point, a periodic orbit or a chaotic attractor. Clearly, stability of the\n\nsynchronization state\n\nx 1 (t ) = x 2 (t ) = L = x N (t ) = s (t )\nof the network (4) is determined by the dynamics of an isolate node (i.e., function\n\n(7)\n\nf and solution\n\ns (t ) ), the coupling strength c , the inner linking matrix \u0393 and the coupling matrix A .\n\nGiven the dynamics of an isolate node and the inner linking structure, the synchronizability of a\nnetwork with respect to a specific coupling configuration is said to be strong if the network can\nsynchronize with a small coupling strength. To investigate the stability of the synchronization state (7),\nwe set\n\nx i (t ) = s (t ) + \u03b7i ( t ) , i = 1, 2, L, N\nand linearize Eq. (4) about\n\ns (t ) . This leads to\n\u03b7& = \u03b7[ Df ( s)] + cA \u03b7\u0393\n\nwhere\n\n(8)\n\n\u03b7 = (\u03b7 1 , \u03b7 2 , L , \u03b7 N ) T \u2208 R N \u00d7n , Df (s ) \u2208 R n\u00d7n is the Jacobian of f on s (t ) . Let\n\n0 = \u03bb1 > \u03bb2 \u2265 \u03bb3 \u2265 L \u2265 \u03bb N\nbe the eigenvalues of matrix\n\nA and \u03a6 = [\u03c6 1 \u03c6 2 L \u03c6 N ] \u2208 R N \u00d7N be the corresponding\n\n(generalized) eigenvector basis such that\n\nA\u03c6 k = \u03bbk \u03c6 k ,\nBy expanding each column\n\nk = 1, 2, L, N\n\n\u03b7 on the basis \u03a6 , we have\n\n\u03b7 = \u03a6\u03c5\nwhere the matrix\n\n(9)\n\n\u03c5 \u2208 R N\u00d7n obey the following equations\n\n6\n\n(10)\n\n\f\u03c5& = \u03c5 [ Df ( s )] + c\u039b\u03c5\u0393\nwhere\n\n(11)\n\n\u039b = diag (\u03bb1 , \u03bb 2 , L, \u03bb N ) . Let \u03c5 k be the kth row of \u03c5 . We have\n\u03c5& kT = [ Df ( s(t )) + c\u03bbk \u0393 ]\u03c5 Tk , k = 1, 2, L, N\n\n(12)\n\nWe have now transferred the stability problem of the synchronization state (7) to the stability problem\nof the\n\nN n -dimensional\n\nlinear time-varying systems (12). Note that\n\nsynchronization state. If the following\n\n\u03bb1 = 0 corresponds to the\n\nN \u2212 1 n -dimensional linear time-varying systems\n\nw& = [ Df (s (t )) + c\u03bb k \u0393]w , k = 2, L , N\nare exponentially stable, then\n\n(13)\n\n\u03b7 (t ) will tends to the origin exponentially which implies that the\n\nsynchronization state (7) is exponentially stable.\n\nIf\n\ns(t ) = s is an equilibrium point, then a necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of\n\nsystems (13) is that the real parts of the eigenvalues of the matrix\n\n[ Df ( s ) + c\u03bb 2 \u0393] are all negative.\n\nHere we are particular interested in the case that s (t ) is chaotic. A commonly used criterion for chaos\nsynchronization is that all the transverse Lyapunov exponents of Eqs. (13) are negative [24]. However,\nit has been shown that this criterion is by no means a sufficient condition for synchronization. Intervals\nof desynchronized bursting behavior, called attractor bubbling, can appear even when the largest\ntransverse Lyapunov exponent is negative [27]. Another method for the analysis of the stability of\nsynchronization in chaotic systems is the Lyapunov function method, which is well-known in nonlinear\nsystems theory [23]. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, we have the following sufficient criterion\nfor synchronization.\n\nLemma 1: Consider the network (4). Suppose that there exists a\nconstants\n\nn \u00d7 n diagonal matrix D > 0 , two\n\nd < 0 and \u03c4 > 0 such that\n\n[ Df (s (t )) + d\u0393 ]T D + D [ Df (s(t )) + d\u0393 ] \u2264 \u2212\u03c4 I n\nfor all\n\n(14)\n\nd \u2264 d , where I n \u2208 R n\u00d7 n is an unit matrix. If\n\nc\u03bb2 \u2264 d\n\n7\n\n(15)\n\n\fThen the synchronization state (7) is exponentially stable.\nProof: Inequality (15) implies that\n\nc\u03bbk \u2264 d , k = 2, L , N\n\n(16)\n\nFrom (14) and (16), we have\n\n[ Df (s (t )) + c\u03bb k \u0393 ]T D + D [ Df ( s(t )) + c\u03bbk \u0393 ] \u2264 \u2212\u03c4 I n , k = 2, L , N\n\n(17)\n\nwhich means systems (13) are uniformly exponentially stable with Lyapunov functions\n\nV k = w T D w , k = 2, L , N .\n\nSince\n\n(18)\n\n\u03bb2 < 0 and d < 0 , inequality (15) is equivalent to\nd\n\u03bb2\n\nc\u2265\nA small value of\n\n(19)\n\n\u03bb 2 corresponds to a large value of | \u03bb2 | which implies that the network (4) can\n\nsynchronize with a small coupling strength\n\nc . Therefore, synchronizability of network (4) with respect\n\nto a specific coupling configuration can be characterized by the second-largest eigenvalue\ncorresponding coupling matrix\n\n\u03bb 2 of the\n\nA.\n\nB. Synchronizability of the Scale-Free Dynamical Network\nFor clarity, we use\nwhich has\n\nN\n\nA sf ( m , N ) to denote the coupling matrix of a scale-free dynamical network (4),\n\nnodes and m ( N\n\nsecond-largest eigenvalue of\n\n\u2212 m \u2212 1) connections (i.e., m0 = m = m ). Let \u03bb2 sf (m , N ) be the\n\nA sf ( m , N ) . Numerical computation reveals that for a fixed value of\n\nm , \u03bb2 sf (m , N ) increases to a negative constant \u03bb 2sf ( m ) as N increases. Here for each pair of\nvalues of\n\nm and N , \u03bb2 sf (m , N ) is obtained by averaging the results of 20 runs. In particular, for\n\nm = 3, 5 , 7 , 9 and 11, one has \u03bb2 sf (m ) \u2248 \u22120.944 , \u2212 0.973 , \u2212 0.981 , \u2212 0.983 and\n\n\u2212 0.985 , respectively, as shown in Fig. 1.\n\n8\n\n\fTherefore, the adding of new nodes in a scale-free network can not decrease the synchronizability of\nthe network. In fact, due to the self-organization process a scale-free network, the synchronizability of\na large size scale-free dynamical network will remain almost unchanged by the constantly adding of\nnew nodes. The numerical results also show that the value of\n\nm (i.e., the number of connections when\n\na new node is connected to the existed nodes) has only a minor influence on the synchronizability of a\nscale-free network. In the thermodynamic limit case, we have the following conjecture.\n\nConjecture 1: For any given constant m\n\n> 1 , we have\n\nlim \u03bb2 sf (m , N ) = \u03bb\u02c62 sf\n\n(20)\n\nN \u2192\u221e\n\nwhere\n\n\u03bb\u03022 sf is a constant that is unrelated with m .\n\nC. Compare to the Locally Regular Coupled Network\nOver the past decade, much work on synchronization in coupled oscillator arrays had been emphasised\non regular coupling scheme. One typical case is a locally coupled regular network with periodic\nboundary condition x N + j\n...,\n\ni \u00b1l , l\n\n= x j in which each node i is adjacent to its neighbour nodes i \u00b1 1 , i \u00b1 2 ,\n\nis a positive integer. The state equations of the network are\nl\n\nx& i = f ( x i ) + c\u2211 \u0393( x i + j + x i\u2212 j \u2212 2x i ) , i = 1, 2, L, N\n\n(21)\n\nj =1\n\nThe coupling matrix\n\nAlc of network (21) is a circulant matrix and its second-largest eigenvalue can\n\nbe computed as\nl\n\uf8eb j\u03c0 \uf8f6\n\u03bb2lc = \u22124 \u2211 sin 2 \uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8edN \uf8f8\nj =1\n\nThe regular network (21) contains\n\nN\n\nN\n\nnodes and ( 2l \u2212 1) N connections. Let\n\n(22)\n\nm = 2l \u2212 1 . For large\n\n, the regular network (21) and the scale-free network (4) have about the same number of\n\nconnections. However, the synchronizability of the two networks is quite different: as the number of\nnodes increases to infinity, the second-largest eigenvalue of the locally coupled regular network (21)\ndecreases to zero, while the second-largest eigenvalue of the scale-free network (4) increases to a\n\n9\n\n\fnegative constant. Therefore, it's almost practically impossible to achieve synchronization in a very\nlarge network with only locally coupled configuration.\n\nD. An Example\nNow we illustrate the above analysis using a Chua's oscillator as a dynamical node. In the\ndimensionless form, a single Chua's oscillator is described by [28]:\n\n\uf8eb x& 1 \uf8f6 \uf8eb \u03b1 ( x 2 \u2212 x1 + f ( x1 ))\uf8f6\n\uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nx1 \u2212 x2 + x 3 \uf8f7 ,\n\uf8ec x& 2 \uf8f7 = \uf8ec\n\uf8ec& \uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\u2212 \u03b2x2 \u2212 \u03b3x 3\n\uf8ed x3 \uf8f8 \uf8ed\n\uf8f8\nwhere\n\n(23)\n\nf (.) is a piecewise linear function,\n\n\uf8f1\u2212bx1 \u2212 a + b\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\nf ( x1 ) = \uf8f2\u2212ax1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\uf8f3\u2212bx1 + a \u2212 b\nin which\n\nx1 > 1\nx1 \u2264 1\n\n(24)\n\nx1 < \u22121\n\n\u03b1 > 0, \u03b2 > 0, \u03b3 > 0 , and a < b < 0 . Suppose that two coupled Chua's oscillators are\n\nlinked through the first state variable, i.e.,\n\n\u0393 = diag (1, 0, 0) . The state equations of the entire\n\nnetwork are\nN\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\n\u03b1\n(\nx\n\u2212\nx\n+\nf\n(\nx\n))\n+\nc\na\nx\n\uf8f7\ni\n2\ni\n1\ni\n1\n\u2211\nij\nj\n1\n\uf8eb x& i1 \uf8f6 \uf8ec\nj\n=\n1\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n&\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7 , i = 1, 2, L , N .\nx\n=\nx\n\u2212\nx\n+\nx\n\uf8ec i2 \uf8f7\ni1\ni2\ni3\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec x& \uf8f7\n\u2212 \u03b2xi 2 \u2212 \u03b3xi 3\n\uf8ed i3 \uf8f8 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\nFor network (25), it can be checked that the constant\n\n(25)\n\nd in Lemma 1 can be taken as d = \u2212 a . If the\n\nsystem parameters are chosen to be\n\n\u03b1 = 10.0000, \u03b2 = 15.0000, \u03b3 = 0.0385, a = \u22121.2700, b = \u22120.6800 ,\n\n(26)\n\nthen Chua's oscillator (23) has a chaotic attractor, as shown in Fig 2. For sufficiently large number of\nnodes, chaotic synchronization of the network (25) with a scale-free coupling structure can be\nachieved, provided that\n\nc>\n\na\n.\n\u03bb2 sf ( m )\n\n10\n\n(27)\n\n\fFor instance, for\nand\n\nm = 3, 5 and 7 , synchronization can be achieved with c > 1.346 , c > 1.306\n\nc > 1.295 , respectively.\n\nIII. ROBUSTNESS AND FRAGILITY OF SYNCHRONIZATION\nNow we consider the robustness of synchronizability in scale-free dynamical networks against either\nrandomly or specifically removal of a small fraction\n\nf ( 0 < f << 1) of nodes in the network.\n\nClearly, the removal of some nodes in a network (4) can only change the coupling matrix. According to\nthe above analysis, it amounts to studying the changes in the second-largest eigenvalue of the coupling\nmatrix of the network. If the second-largest eigenvalue of the coupling matrix remains unchanged, then\nthe synchronization stability of the network will also remain unchanged after the removal of some\nnodes.\n\nFor simplicity, we use\n\n~\nA sf \u2208 R N \u00d7 N and A sf \u2208 R( N \u2212[ fN ])\u00d7 ( N \u2212[ fN ]) to denote the coupling matrix of\n\nthe original network with\n\nN\n\nnodes and the network after removal of\n\n[ fN ] nodes, respectively. Here,\n\n~\n[ fN ] stands for the smaller but nearest integer to the real number fN . Let \u03bb2 sf and \u03bb2 sf be the\nsecond-largest eigenvalues of\nand\n\n~\nA sf and A sf , respectively. In the following simulations, N = 3000\n\nm0 = m = 3 , namely, the original network contains 3000 nodes and about 9000 connections.\n\nA. Robustness of Synchronization against Failures\nSuppose that nodes\n\ncoupling matrix\n\ni1 , i2 ,..., i[ fN ] have been removed from the network. One can construct the new\n\n~\nA sf from the original coupling matrix A sf as following: First, form the minor matrix\n\nB \u2208 R ( N \u2212[ fN ])\u00d7 ( N \u2212[ fN ]) of A sf by removing the i1 th, i 2 th, ..., i[ fN ] th row-column pairs of A sf .\nThen, obtain\n\n~\nA sf by re-computing the diagonal elements of the above minor matrix according to\n\nformulas (2)-(3) with\n\nN\n\nbeing replaced by\n\n(1 \u2212 f ) N .\n\n11\n\n\fIt was found that even when as many as\n\n5%\n\nof randomly chosen nodes are removed, the second-\n\nlargest eigenvalue of the coupling matrix remains almost unchanged (see Fig. 3), i.e.,\n\n~\n\u03bb 2sf \u2248 \u03bb2sf .\n\n(28)\n\nThis implies that the synchronizability of the network is almost unaffected.\n\nThe error tolerance of synchronizability in scale-free networks may be due to their extremely\ninhomogeneous connectivity distributions. Since most of the nodes in a scale-free network are 'small'\nnodes with very low degrees,\n\nN >> 1\n\nand\n\n[ fN ] 'small' nodes will be selected with much higher probability if\n\nf << 1 . The removal of these 'small' nodes does not alter the path structure of the\n\nremaining nodes and, thus, does not destroy the connectivity of the network. This means that the\ncoupling matrix\n\n~\nA sf remains to be an irreducible and symmetric matrix. Furthermore, a 'small' node\n\nwith a low degree corresponds to a row-column pair with small 1-norm. So it is reasonable to\n\nA sf remains almost unchanged\n\nconjecture that the second-largest eigenvalue of the coupling matrix\n\nby taking such row-column pairs with small 1-norms. That is, if the removed nodes\n\ni1 , i2 ,..., i[ fN ] are\n\nall 'small' nodes with very low degrees, then one should have\n\n\u03bb 2 (B) \u2248 \u03bb 2sf\nwhere\n\n(29)\n\n\u03bb 2 (B) is the second-largest eigenvalue of the minor matrix B .\n\nOn the other hand, from the construction of the new coupling matrix\n\n~\nA sf , it is easy to see that\n\n~\nA sf = B + D ,\nwhere\n\n(30)\n\nD = diag (d 11 , d12 , L, d N \u2212[ fN ] ) is a nonnegative diagonal matrix with\nN \u2212[ fN ]\n\n[ fN ]\n\nj =1\n\nj =1\n\n\u2211 d jj =\n\n\u2211k\n\nij\n\n.\n\n(31)\n\nIf the right-hand side of (31) is sufficiently small, one may deduce that\n\n~\n\u03bb2 sf \u2248 \u03bb 2 ( B) .\n\n12\n\n(32)\n\n\f(29) and (32) together imply that (28) holds, i.e., the second-largest eigenvalue of the coupling matrix\nremains almost unchanged after the removal of a small fraction of randomly chosen nodes.\n\nAlthough the scale-free structure is particularly well-suited to tolerate random errors, it is also\nparticularly vulnerable to deliberate attacks.\n\nTo simulate the influence of an attack on the synchronizability of the network, one may first remove\nthe node with highest degree, and then continue to select and remove other nodes in decreasing order of\ndegrees. In doing so, it was found in Fig. 4 that the second-largest eigenvalue of the coupling matrix\nincreases rapidly, almost decreases to half of its original value in magnitude (from the original\n\n~\n\u03bb2 sf = \u22120.953 to \u03bb2 sf = \u22120.519 ), when only f = 1% fraction of the most connected nodes was\nremoved. At a low critical threshold,\n\n~\nf = 1.6% , \u03bb2 sf abruptly changes to zero, implying that the\n\nwhole network was broken into isolate clusters.\n\nThis vulnerability of connectivity and synchronizability to attack in scale-free networks is also rooted\nin their extremely inhomogeneous connectivity distribution. The network dynamics are dominated by a\nsmall number of 'big' nodes with high degrees. The removal of a small fraction of such 'big' nodes\nimplies the minor matrix\nrow-column pairs of\n\nB \u2208 R ( N \u2212[ fN ])\u00d7 ( N \u2212[ fN ]) of A sf is derived by removing a small fraction of\n\nA sf with large 1-norms. However, we find that the second-largest eigenvalue of\n\nB approximately equal to that of the original matrix A sf , i.e., we still have\n\n\u03bb 2 (B) \u2248 \u03bb 2sf\n\nOn the other hand, in this case, we can see from (30) and (31) that the new coupling matrix\nderived from matrix\n\n~\nA sf is\n\nB by adding a nonnegative diagonal matrix with a large sum of the diagonal\n\nelements. This would results in a drastic change in the second-largest eigenvalue of the matrix, i.e.,\n\n~\n\u03bb2 sf is much greater than \u03bb 2 (B) and \u03bb2 sf .\n\n13\n\n\fThe above analysis, along with supportive numerical results, suggests the following conjecture:\n\nConjecture 2: Suppose that\nremoving\n\nN >> 1 , 0 \u2264 f << 1 . Let B\n\nbe a minor matrix of\n\nA sf by arbitrarily\n\n[ fN ] row-column pairs of A sf . Then\n\n\u03bb 2 (B) \u2248 \u03bb 2sf\nMoreover, if\n\n]\n[ fN ] sufficiently small nodes are deleted, i.e., {k i j }[jfN\n=1 are sufficiently small, then\n\n~\n\u03bb2 sf \u2248 \u03bb 2 (B) \u2248 \u03bb2 sf\n\n(33)\n\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nThe work of Albert et. al. [16] and the work presented in this paper have shown that both the\nconnectivity and the synchronizability of a scale-free dynamical network are robust against random\nremoval of nodes but fragile to some specific removal of nodes. These results, together with some other\nrecent findings about the robustness and power-law in complex systems (for example, see [27-29]),\nindicate that 'robust yet fragile' seems to be a generic feature for topological and dynamical properties\nof scale-free networks that obey power-law distributions.\n\n14\n\n\fREFERENCES\n\n[1] M.
