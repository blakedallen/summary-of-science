With the increase of the experimental capabilities it becomes necessary to consider more and more small\neffects in order to account for the signal, therefore (relativistic) gravitation\nhas to be considered in any highly sensitive experiments, no matter what\nthey are designed for.\nThe performances of laser cooled atomic devices is limited on Earth by\ngravity. Further improvements demand now that new experiments take\nplace in free falling (or nearly free falling) satellites. A laser cooled atomic\nclock, named PHARAO, will be a part of ACES (Atomic Clock Ensemble in\nSpace), an ESA mission on the ISS. Various other experimental possibilities\ninvolving \"Hyper-precision cold atom interferometry in space\" are presently\nconsidered. They might result in a project (called \"Hyper\") in the future\n[1].\nThe aim of the present paper is to hold the bookkeeping of the various\ngravito-inertial effects in a nearly free falling satellite. For this purpose we\nconsider the most ambitious goal which has been considered for Hyper i.e.\nthe measurement of the Lense-Thirring effect.\n\n\f2\nThe Lense-Thirring effect is a local rotation of a gyroscope relatively to a\ntelescope pointing towards a far away star. It is a relativistic consequence\nof the diurnal rotation of the Earth which \"drags the inertial frames\" in\nits neighborhood.\nThe angular velocity of the telescope relative to the gyroscopes depends\non the position. Therefore, in a satellite, it is a function of the time. In\nHyper, the angular velocity is measured by atomic-wave-gyroscopes and\nits time dependence is analyzed [9]. The consequence is that the device is\nsensitive to the variation of the gravitation in the satellite and no to the\ngravitation itself. We do not believe that it is easy to achieve the required\nstabilization of the gravitational field due to the local masses but it is not\nimpossible in principle. For this reason we will study only the tidal field of\nfar away masses whose effect cannot be removed at all.\nThe parameter which plays a role in the calculation of the Lense-Thirring\neffect is the angular momentum of the central mass. It is much bigger for\nJupiter than the Earth. Therefore we will discuss both cases, without any\nconsideration on the cost of the corresponding missions.\nIn the sequel the greek indices run from 0 to 3 and the Latin indices\nfrom 1 to 3. We use the summation rule of repeated indices (one up and\none down).\nThe Minkowski tensor is \u03b7\u03b1\u03b2 = diag [1, \u22121, \u22121, \u22121]; its inverse is \u03b7 \u03b1\u03b2 .\nWe use geometrical units where c = G = 1.\nII.\n\nTHE LOCAL EXPERIMENT IN A SATELLITE\n\nIn the satellite, the experimental set-up consists in a telescope pointing\n\u2192\ntowards a far away star in \u0002the \u2212\nu (1) direction\northogonal\natomic\n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u0002\u2192and two\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\nu (2) , \u2212\nu (1) of fig. 1.\nu (1) and \u2212\nSagnac units in the planes u (3) , \u2212\n\nFIG. 1: The experimental setup.\n\n\f3\nA.\n\nThe atomic Sagnac unit\n\nAn atomic Sagnac unit (ASU) is made of two counter-propagating atom\ninterferometers which discriminate between rotation and acceleration (see\nfigure 2-a).\n\nFIG. 2: An atomic Sagnac unit (ASU).\n\nEach interferometer is a so-called Ramsey-Bord\u00e9 interferometer with a\nMach-Zehnder geometry ( figure 2-b). The atomic beam from a magnetooptical trap interacts three times with a laser field. In the first interaction\nzone the atomic beam is split coherently, by a Raman effect, into two beams\nwhich are redirected and recombined in the second and the third interaction\nzone.\nThe mass of the atom depends on its internal state, therefore it is not\na constant along the different paths. However, the change of the mass is\nvery small; it leads to negligible corrections on the main effects which is\nalready very small. In the case of the cesium, the mass is m = 133 \u00d7 1.66 \u00d7\n10\u221227 = 2.2 \u00d7 10\u221225 kg and the wave length of the lasers is \u03bb = 850nm.\n4\u03c0~\nThe momentum transferred to the atom during the interaction is\n. The\n\u03bb\nrecoil of the atom results in a Sagnac loop which permits to measure the\nangular velocity of the set-up relatively to a local inertial frame. The device\nis also sensitive to the accelerations.\nIn an ideal set-up the two interferometers are identical coplanar parallelograms with their center OS and OS\u2032 at the same point but many perturbations have to be considered. The geometry of the device is actually\ndetermined by the interaction between the initial atomic beam and the\nlasers ; Therefore a full treatment of the atom-laser interaction in a gravitational field is obviously necessary to study the response of the Atomic\nSagnac Unit (ASU). However the geometrical model is useful to give a\n\n\f4\nphysical intuition of the phenomena. In this context we assume that the\ntwo interferometers remain idealized identical parallelograms but that OS\nand OS\u2032 are no longer at the same point : This is the only perturbation\nthat we consider here. It is sufficient to take the flavor of the gravitational\nperturbations which have to be taken into account and, more generally, of\nthe difficulty inherent to such an experiment.\nB.\n\nThe phase difference\n\nLet us assume that the fundamental element is known in some coordinates comoving with the experimental set-up :\n\u0001\nds2 = 1 + K(0)(0) dT 2 + 2K(0)(k) dT dX (k)\n(1)\n\u0001\n(k)\n(j)\n+ \u03b7(k)(j) + K(k)(j) dX dX\nIn order to calculate up to first order the gravitational perturbation of\nthe phase due to K(\u03b1)(\u03b2) , we use a method which we summarize now [2].\nFirst we calculate the quantity \u03a8 :\n\u03a8 = K(0)(0) + 2K(0)(k) vg(k) + K(k)(j) vg(k) vg(j)\n\n(2)\n\n(k)\n\nwhere vg is the velocity of the atoms (i.e. the unperturbed group velocity).\nThe quantity \u03a8 is a function of the time and the position of the atom.\nThen we consider an atom which arrives at time t at point B of figure 2b . Now the position is a function of the time t\u2032 only because t is considered\nas a given quantity. The function \u03a8 is a function of the time, t\u2032 , only. The\nphase difference is\n\n\u03b4\u03c6 =\n\n\u03c9\n2\n\nZ\n\nt\n\n\u03a8 (t\u2032 ) dt\u2032 \u2212\n\nt\u22122TD /(2)\n\n\u03c9\n2\n\nZ\n\nt\n\n\u03a8 (t\u2032 ) dt\u2032\n\n(3)\n\nt\u22122TD /(1)\n\nThe integrals are performed along path (2) and (1) of the interferometer\nm c2\n.\n(figure 2-b). The \"angular frequency\" \u03c9 is defined as\n~\nC.\n\nThe local metric\n\nIn order to calculate \u03b4\u03c6, we must know the local metric G(\u03b1)(\u03b2) =\n\u03b7(\u03b1)(\u03b2) + K(\u03b1)(\u03b2) .\nO, in the satellite and at point O a tetrad\no\nn We choose an origin,\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nwhere\nu\u03b1\nu\u03b1\n,\nu\n,\nu\n,\nu\n(0) is the 4-velocity of point O and where\n(0)\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n\n\f5\no \b\nn\n\u2192\n\u2212\nthe three vectors u\u03b1\n(k) = 0, u (k) are represented on the figure 1. The\nvectors of the tetrad are orthogonal : u\u03b1\n(\u03bc) u\u03b1(\u03c3) = \u03b7(\u03bc)(\u03c3) . The coordinate\nindices, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03c3, etc, are lowered or raised by the means of the metric tensor,\ng\u03b1\u03b2 or g \u03b1\u03b2 ; the Minkowski indices are raised or lowered with the Minkowski\nmetric or its inverse, \u03b7\u03b1\u03b2 or \u03b7 \u03b1\u03b2 .

The accuracy \u03bc \u223c 10\u22126 remains a very difficult challenge\nas far as the geometry of the set-up is concerned (A.

This must hold for any value of \u03bc, this\nis a necessary condition.

For the Earth, considering\nthe difference between the various models (Godard Earth model 9 and\n10) it appears that the values of the high order multipoles are neither\nknown nor consistent at the required level (10\u221212 ). One can hope that the\nlack of precision on the Jkn coefficients [13] is not important for n 6= 0\nbecause the diurnal rotation modulates the frequency of the corresponding\ncontribution in \u00db ,(k)(j) X (k) X (j) . However it is necessary to increase our\nknowledge of the axisymmetrical potential of the central body in order that\n\u03be k \u2206Jk0 . \u03b5\u03beO2 where \u2206Jk0 is the uncertainty on Jk0 = Jk . Such a relation\nholds true for k = 2. It could be presently achieved with low values of \u03be (on\n\n\f15\nhigh orbits) but the Lense-Thirring effect is proportional to \u03be 3 (see table\n4 above) and it seems impossible to measure the Lense-Thirring effect for\n\u03be << 1 in not to far a future.\nThis question is crucial but Hyper might, itself, bring an answer to this\nquestion by the means of the time analysis. Now we forget these problems\nbecause in the simple case that we consider the quadratic quantities do not\nbring any contribution to the signal.\nA.\n\nSignificant terms in \u03a8u\n\nWe consider that the motion of the satellite takes place in the (x, y)-plane\n\u2192\n\u2212\nwhile the vector l lies in the (x, z)-plane.

One can\nconsider that the coordinate, X = X (1) of the atom is a function of the\ntime: X = vg (T \u2212 T0 ) .\nX\nTherefore we expand \u00db ,(k)(j) = \u00db ,(k)(j) (T0 ) + \u00db ,(k)(j)(l) (T0 ) v (l) \u00d7\nvg\n\u2192\nu (l) is the orbital velocity.\nwhere v (l) \u2212\nBefore\nperforming\nexplicit\ncalculation\nwe\nnotice\nthat\n\u00db ,(k)(j) (T0 ) X (k) X (j) will not bring any contribution to the phase\ndifference 3 because OS and OS\u2032 are two centers of symmetry.

They can be\nmeasured and distinguished from each other.\nThe Lense-Thirring effect due to the angular momentum of the central\nbody appears in the terms K\u03c3 and K2\u03b8\u00b1\u03c3 while the possible existence of\na preferred frame appears in K\u03b8\u00b1\u03c3 which depends on the components of\n\u2192\nw.\n\u03b11 \u2212\nThe signal due to the Lense-Thirring effect is associated with the signal\ndue to \u03b4 (1) . Today, it seems impossible to reduce \u03b4 (1) significantly, this is\nthe reason why it should be calculated from the Fourier analysis of the\n\u2192\nsignal itself altogether with the velocity \u03b11 \u2212\nw.\nThe interest of the spin is obvious. If \u03c3 is constant (no spin) the signal is\nthe sum of two periodic signals with frequency \u03bdO and 2\u03bdO where \u03bdO is the\norbital frequency of the satellite ; therefore one ASU gives two informations\n(two functions of the time). When the satellite spins, we get 9 functions of\nthe time t. The information is much more important in this case.\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn Hyper, the Lense-Thirring effect is associated with many perturbations which cannot be cancelled. We have exhibited the various terms\nthat one needs to calculate in order to obtain the full signal and we have\nemphasized the necessity to increase our knowledge of the Newtonian gravitational potential. This is still more crucial for Jupiter despite the fact\nthat the Lense-Thirring effect is much bigger.\nUsing four parameters, \u03be, \u03b5, \u03b7 and \u03bc defined in table 2, we have also\nsketched a method to take into account the residual gravitational field in\na nearly free falling satellite, namely the tidal and higher order effects.\nCompared with GPB, the principle of the measure is not the same, the\ndifficulties are quite different but the job is not easier. For instance, considering the quantities K\u03c3 or K2\u03b8\u00b1\u03c3 above, one can check that, for an Earth\nsatellite, \u03b4 (1) must remain smaller than 2nm for the corresponding signal\nto remain smaller than the Lense-Thirring one. It does not seem that such\na precision can be controlled in the construction of the experimental device\nitself. It is therefore necessary to measure \u03b4 (1) with such an accuracy.\n\n\f21\nWhat can be deduced from the time analysis depends on the accuracy\nof the various parameters. From K2\u03b8\u00b12\u03c3 we deduce \u03b1. Then from K\u03b8\u00b1\u03c3\nwe obtain \u03b11 wq /c and \u03b11 w3\u0302 /c as two functions of \u03b8w . Therefore one can\ncheck if \u03b11 w = 0 or not.\nMs c\nFrom K2\u03b8\u00b1\u03c3 one can calculate 2 \u03b4 (1) as a function G(+) of Jq /r02 , \u03b8J\nr0 vg\n\u0012\n\u00133/2 2 2\nMs\nc TD\nand\nand as a different function, G(\u2212) of the same argur0\nr02\n\u2192\n\u2212\nments. One could check the equality G(+) = G(\u2212) . If we assume that J s\nis known, then \u03b8J is known and from the equality G(+) = G(\u2212) we deduce\n\u2192 \u0011\n1 + \u03b3 + \u03b11 /4 \u0010\u2212\nJ s one could\nthe value of Jq . Using the relation Jq =\n2\nq\ncheck whether \u03b3 + \u03b11 /4 = 1.\nMs c\nK\u03c3 would give 2 \u03b4 (1) as a function of Jq /r02 , \u03b8J and J 3\u0302 /r02 . Using the\nr0 vg\n1 + \u03b3 + \u03b11 /4 \u0010\u2212\n\u2192 \u00113\u0302\nprevious results, we obtain J 3\u0302 . The relation J 3\u0302 =\nJs\n2\ngives an other test of the value of \u03b3 + \u03b11 /4.\nBut over all, the best test would be that the signal (as a function of the\ntime) fits the theoretical prediction.\nAs a final conclusion let us put forwards that the geometric scheme which\nhas been used is just a preliminary contribution to the discussion on the\nfeasibility of Hyper. Only a more powerful model can answer the question.\nThis model should take into account all the gravitational perturbations\nthat we have outlined here and it should consider the interaction between\nlaser fields and matter waves in more a realistic manner. Such an approach\nhas been recently developed [7], [8] it could give definitive results in the\nfuture.\n\n[1] R.
