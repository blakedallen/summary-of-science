RD-COMPOSITION SERIES OVER A\nCOMMUTATIVE RING\nFRAN\u00c7OIS COUCHOT\nAbstract. If R is a commutative ring, then we prove that every finitely generated R-module has a pure-composition series with indecomposable cyclic\nfactors and any two such series are isomorphic if and only if R is a B\u00e9zout ring\nand a CF-ring. When R is a such ring, the length of a pure-composition series\nof a finitely generated R-module M is compared with its Goldie dimension and\nwe prove that these numbers are equal if and only if M is a direct sum of cyclic\nmodules. We also give an example of an artinian module over a noetherian\ndomain, which has an RD- composition series with uniserial factors. Finally\nwe prove that every pure-injective R-module is RD-injective if and only if R\nis an arithmetic ring.\n\nIn this paper, for a commutative ring R, we study the following properties:\n(1) Every finitely generated R-module M has a finite chain of RD-submodules\nwith cyclic factors.\n(2) Every finitely generated R-module M has a finite chain of RD-submodules\nwith indecomposable cyclic factors.\n(3) R satisfies (2) and any two chains of RD-submodules of M, with indecomposable cyclic factors, are isomorphic.\nIn [1], L.Salce and P.Zanardo proved that every valuation ring satisfies (3), and\nin [2] C.Naud\u00e9 showed that each h-local and B\u00e9zout domain also satisfies (3).\nIn section 1, we give definitions and some preliminary results. It is proved that\nevery ring that satisfies (1), is a Kaplansky ring(or an elementary divisor ring), but\nwe don't know if the converse holds.\nIn section 2, we state that a ring R satisfies (3) if and only if R is a B\u00e9zout ring\nand a CF-ring([3]). We show that R satisfies (2), when R is a semilocal arithmetic\nring or an h-semilocal B\u00e9zout domain, and for every finitely generated R-module\nM, we prove that any chain of RD-submodules of M has the same length which is\nequal to the number of terms of a finite sequence of prime ideals, associated to M.\nHowever, we give two examples of semilocal arithmetic rings that don't satisfy (3).\nIn section 3, when R is a ring that verifies (3), the length l(M ) of each chain of\nRD-submodules, with indecomposable cyclic factors, is compared with g(M ), the\nGoldie dimension of M. We show that g(M ) \u2264 l(M ) and that M contains a direct\nsum of g(M ) nonzero indecomposable cyclic submodules which is an essential RDsubmodule of M. Hence it follows that M is a direct sum of cyclic submodules if\nand only if g(M ) = l(M ). These results were proved in [1], when R is a valuation\nring and in [2], when R is an h-local B\u00e9zout domain.\nFinally, in section 4, we give an example of an artinian module, over a noetherian\ndomain, that has a finite chain of RD-submodules, with uniserial factors. We also\ngive explicit examples of pure-injective modules that fail to be RD-injective, over\n1\n\n\f2\n\nFRAN\u00c7OIS COUCHOT\n\nnoetherian domains. We prove that every pure-injective R-module is RD-injective\nif and only if R is an arithmetic ring. When R is a domain, this result was proved\nin [4], by C.G Naud\u00e9, G. Naud\u00e9 and L.M. Pretorius.\n1. Preliminaries\nAll rings in this paper are commutative with unity, and all modules are unital.\nWe recall that a module, over a ring R, is uniserial if its set of submodules is totally\nordered by inclusion. A ring R is a valuation ring if R is a uniserial module, and R\nis arithmetic if RP is a valuation ring for every maximal ideal P. We say that R is a\nB\u00e9zout ring if every finitely generated ideal is principal and R is a Kaplansky ring\n(or elementary divisor ring) if every finitely presented R-module is a finite direct\nsum of cyclic presented modules (see [5] and [6]).\nAn exact sequence of R-modules : 0 \u2192 F \u2192 E \u2192 G \u2192 0 is pure-exact if it\nremains exact when tensoring it with any R-module. In this case we say that F is\na pure submodule of E. When rE \u2229 F = rF for every r \u2208 R, we say that F is an\nRD-submodule of E(relatively divisible) and that the sequence is RD-exact. Then\nevery pure submodule is an RD-submodule, and the equivalence holds if and only\nif R is an arithmetic ring ([7] and [8]). We say that an R-module M has a purecomposition series (respectively an RD-composition series) if there exists a finite\nchain {0} = M0 \u2282 M1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Mn = M of pure (respectively RD-) submodules.\nIf we denote Ai =ann(Mi /Mi\u22121 ), then (Ai )1\u2264i\u2264n is called the annihilator sequence\nof the pure-composition series. We say that the annihilator sequence is increasing\nif A1 \u2286 A2 \u2286 * * * \u2286 An , and it is totally ordered if Ai and Aj are comparable\n\u2200i, \u2200j, 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n.\nAn R-module F is pure-projective (respectively RD-projective) if for every pure\n(respectively RD-) exact sequence: 0 \u2192 N \u2192 M \u2192 L \u2192 0, of R-modules, the\nfollowing sequence: 0 \u2192 HomR (F, N ) \u2192 HomR (F, M ) \u2192 HomR (F, L) \u2192 0, is\nexact.\nAn R-module F is pure-injective (respectively RD-injective) if for every pure\n(respectively RD-) exact sequence: 0 \u2192 N \u2192 M \u2192 L \u2192 0 of R-modules, the\nfollowing sequence: 0 \u2192 HomR (L, F ) \u2192 HomR (M, F ) \u2192 HomR (N, F ) \u2192 0, is\nexact. Then we have the following proposition.\nProposition 1.1. Let R be a ring. The following conditions are equivalent:\n(1) Every finitely generated module has a pure-composition series with cyclic\nfactors.\n(2) Every finitely generated module has an RD-composition series with cyclic\nfactors.\nMoreover, if R satisfies one of these conditions, R is a Kaplansky ring.\nProof. If R satifies (1), by the same proof as in [2, Theorem 2.3 and Corollary\n2.4], we show that R is a Kaplansky ring.\nSince every pure submodule is an RD-submodule, it follows that (1) \u21d2 (2).\nIf R satisfies (2) and if we prove that R is an arithmetic ring, by [7, Theorem 3]\nR satisfies (1).\nFor every maximal ideal P, we must prove that RP is a valuation ring. Clearly\nRP also satisfies (2). We may assume that R is local and that P is its maximal\nideal. If R is not a valuation ring, then, as in the proof of [8, Theorem 2], we\nmay suppose that there exist a and b in P such that Ra \u2229 Rb = {0} and ann(a) =\n\n\fMODULES WITH RD-COMPOSITION SERIES OVER A COMMUTATIVE RING\n\n3\n\nann(b) = P. Moreover, there exists an indecomposable R-module M, with two\ngenerators x and y, satisfying the relation bx \u2212 ay = 0. Since R satisfies (2), there\nexists an RD-composition series: {0} = M0 \u2282 M1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Mn = M, such that\nMi /Mi\u22121 = R(zi + Mi\u22121 ) for each i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. For every i, there exist si and ti\nin R such that zi = si x + ti y. Clearly M is generated by {zi | 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n}. Since\ndimR/P (M/P M ) = 2, there exist at least 2 indexes j and k, 1 \u2264 j < k \u2264 n such\nthat (sj , tj ) \u2208\n/ P \u00d7 P and (sk , tk ) \u2208\n/ P \u00d7 P. Let j be the smallest index such that\n(sj , tj ) \u2208\n/ P \u00d7 P. Then dimR/P (Mj /P Mj ) = 1, whence Mj = Rzj . We may assume\nthat there exists z \u2208 M, z = x+ ty, where t \u2208 R, such that Rz is an RD-submodule\nof M. Then M/Rz = R(y + Rz) and if I = ann(M/Rz), I = {r | ry \u2208 Rz}. Let\nr \u2208 I. There exists c \u2208 R such that ry = c(x+ty). Since cx+(tc\u2212r)y = 0, it follows\nthat \u2203u \u2208 R such that c = ub and r \u2212 tc = ua, whence r = u(a + tb). Therefore\nI \u2286 R(a + tb) \u2282 Ra \u2295 Rb which is semi-simple. We deduce that I = Rd where\nd = 0 or d = a + tb. We get that M/Rz \u2243 R/Rd is RD-projective. Consequently\nRz is a direct summand of M, whence a contradiction.\n\u0003\nWe don't know if the converse of the second assertion of this proposition holds.\nThe following propositions state that some classes of arithmetic rings satisfie the\nequivalent conditions of the Proposition 1.1, and therefore these rings are Kaplansky.\nWe begin with the classe of semi-local arithmetic rings, and we already know\nthat these rings are Kaplansky by [6, Corollary 2.3].\nIf M is a finitely generated R-module, we denote \u03bc(M ) the minimal number of\ngenerators of M.\nProposition 1.2. Let R be a semilocal arithmetic ring. Then every finitely generated R-module M has a pure-composition series with cyclic factors and an increasing annihilator sequence.\nProof. Let P1 , . . . , Pn be the maximal ideals of R, and J its Jacobson radical.\nAs in the proof of [9, Theorem 15], we state that, for every k, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n, there exists\nxk \u2208 M such that, for each y \u2208 xk + Pk MPk , RPk y is a pure submodule of MPk ,\nand annRPk (RPk y) = annRPk (MPk ). Moreover \u03bcRPk (MPk /RPk y) = \u03bcRPk (MPk ) \u2212\n1 if MPk 6= {0}. When MPQ\n= {0} we put xQ\nk = 0. By the chinese remainder\nk\nn\nn\nTheorem, we get M/JM \u2243 k=1 (M/Pk M ) \u2243 k=1 (MPk /Pk MPk ). Consequently\nthere exists x \u2208 M such that x \u2261 xk mod Pk MPk , \u2200k, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n. We deduce\nthat Rx is a pure submodule of M, that ann(Rx) = ann M and that \u03bc(M/Rx) =\n\u03bc(M ) \u2212 1. We complete the proof by induction on m = \u03bc(M ).\n\u0003\nA domain R is said to be h-semilocal if R/I is semilocal for every nonzero ideal\nI, and R is said to be h-local if, in addition, R/P is local for every nonzero prime\nideal P, [10].\nProposition 1.3. Let R be a B\u00e9zout ring with a unique minimal prime ideal Q.\nWe assume that Q is a uniserial module and R/Q an h-semilocal domain. Then\nevery finitely generated R-module has a pure-composition series with cyclic factors\nand an increasing annihilator sequence.\nProof. We may assume that R is not semilocal. If Q 6= {0}, then from [11,\nLemma 17 and 18] there exists only one maximal ideal P such that QRP 6= {0},\nevery ideal contained in Q is comparable to every ideal of R, Q2 = {0} and Q is a\n\n\f4\n\nFRAN\u00c7OIS COUCHOT\n\ntorsion divisible R/Q-module. Let M be a finitely generated module. Since R/Q\nis a B\u00e9zout domain, M/QM \u2243 F \u2295 T, where T is a torsion R/Q-module and F a\nfree R/Q-module of finite rank. Let m be this rank. We prove this proposition by\ninduction on m.\nIf m = 0, then for every x \u2208 M, there exists s \u2208 R \\ Q such that sx \u2208 QM.\nSince Q is uniserial, there exists t \u2208 Q and y \u2208 M such that sx = ty. Since Q\nis a torsion R/Q-module there exists r \u2208\n/ Q such that rt = 0. Since M is finitely\ngenerated, we get that Q \u2282 ann(M ), and that R/ann(M ) is semilocal. From the\nprevious proposition we deduce the result.\nNow suppose m \u2265 1. Let {x1 + QM, . . . , xm + QM } be a basis of F, and {y1 +\nQM, . . . , yp + QM } a spanning set of T. Since Q is the nilradical of R, then, by\nNakayama Lemma {x1 , . . . , xm } \u222a {y1 , . . . , yp } generates M. Let H = {j | 1 \u2264 j \u2264\nm, ann(xj ) = ann(M )}. Since P is the only maximal ideal such that QRP 6= {0},\nthen H = {j | 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m, annRP (RP xj ) = annRP (MP )} also. From [9, Theorem\n15], it follows that there exists j \u2208 H such that RP xj is a pure-submodule of\nMP . Let N be a maximal ideal, N 6= P. Then MN \u2243 (M/QM )N = FN \u2295 TN .\nConsequently RN xj is a direct summand of MN . We deduce that Rxj is a puresubmodule of M and if M \u2032 = M/Rxj , then M \u2032 /QM \u2032 \u2243 F \u2032 \u2295 T where F \u2032 is a\nfree R/Q-module of rank (m \u2212 1). From the induction hypothesis it follows that\nM has a pure-composition series with cyclic factors and an increasing annihilator\nsequence.\n\u0003\nProposition 1.4. Let R be an arithmetical ring and M be a finitely generated Rmodule. If M has a pure-composition series with cyclic factors and an increasing\nannihilator sequence, then \u03bc(M ) is the length of this pure-composition series.\nProof. Let {0} = M0 \u2282 M1 \u2282 M2 * * * \u2282 Mn\u22121 \u2282 Mn = M be a purecomposition series such that Ai = ann(Mi /Mi\u22121 ) \u2286 Ai+1 for every i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u2212 1,\nand such that Mi /Mi\u22121 = R(xi + Mi\u22121 ) for every i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. Then, clearly {xi |\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 n} generates M. Therefore n \u2265 \u03bc(M ). Since M/Mn\u22121 6= {0}, there exists\na maximal ideal P such that (M/Mn\u22121 )P 6= {0}. Consequently (Mi /Mi\u22121 )P 6=\n{0} for every i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. Then MP has a pure-composition series of length n.\nFrom [1, Lemma 1.4] we deduce that n = \u03bcRP (MP ). But \u03bcRP (MP ) \u2264 \u03bc(M ) and\nconsequently n = \u03bc(M ).\n\u0003\nNow, as in [1] or [12], we establish the isomorphy of any two pure-composition\nseries, with cyclic factors and totally ordered annihilator sequences, i.e. the existence of a bijection between the two sets of cyclic factors, such that corresponding\nfactors are isomorphic. We use similar lemmas, with the same proofs, and we get\nthe following theorem:\nTheorem 1.5. Let R be an arithmetic ring. Then any two pure-composition series\nof a finitely generated R-module, with cyclic factors and totally ordered annihilator\nsequences, are isomorphic.\nProof. See the proof of [12, Theorem 1.6, p. 177].\n\n\u0003\n\n2. Pure-composition series with indecomposable cyclic factors\nWe follow T.S. Shores and R. Wiegand [3], by defining a canonical form for\nan R-module M to be a decomposition M \u2243 R/I1 \u2295 R/I2 \u2295 * * * \u2295 R/In , where\nI1 \u2286 I2 \u2286 * * * \u2286 In 6= R, and by calling a ring R a CF-ring if every direct sum of\n\n\fMODULES WITH RD-COMPOSITION SERIES OVER A COMMUTATIVE RING\n\n5\n\nfinitely many cyclic modules has a canonical form. Now, following P. V\u00e1mos [13],\nwe say that R is a torch ring if the following conditions are satisfied :\n(1) R is a nonlocal arithmetic ring.\n(2) R has a unique minimal prime ideal Q which is a nonzero uniserial Rmodule.\n(3) R/Q is an h-local domain.\nWe will say that R is a semi-torch ring if R satisfies the conditions (1), (2) and\n(3'): R/Q is an h-semilocal domain.\nBy [3, Theorem 3.12], a CF-ring is a finite product of indecomposable arithmetic\nrings. If R is an indecomposable CF-ring, then R is a valuation ring, or an h-local\ndomain, or a torch ring.\nWe will say that R is a semi-CF-ring if R is a finite product of indecomposable arithmetic rings, where each indecomposable factor ring is semilocal, or an\nh-semilocal domain, or a semi-torch ring.\nIn the sequel, we will call a ring R to be a PCS-ring if every finitely generated\nmodule has a pure-composition series with indecomposable cyclic factors and if any\ntwo such pure-composition series are isomorphic.\nWe will state the following theorem which is one of the main results of this paper.\nTheorem 2.1. Let R be a ring. Then the following assertions are equivalent :\n(1) R is a B\u00e9zout ring and a CF-ring.\n(2) R is a PCS-ring.\nSome preliminary results are needed to prove this theorem. First we will state\nsome results on finitely generated modules over a B\u00e9zout semi-CF-ring R. Recall\nthat a module M has Goldie dimension n if it has an independant set of uniform\nsubmodules M1 , . . . , Mn such that M1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Mn is essential in M. We will denote\ng(M ) the Goldie dimension of M. Then g(M ) = n if and only if the injective hull\nE(M ) of M is a direct sum of n indecomposable injective modules.\nProposition 2.2. Let R be a B\u00e9zout semi-CF-ring. Then every finitely generated\nR-module has a pure-composition series with indecomposable cyclic factors and a\nfinite Goldie dimension.\nQ\nProof. Let M be a finitely generated R-module. We put R = m\nj=1 Rj , where\nRj is indecomposable. Then M \u2243 \u2295m\nM\n,\nwhere\nM\n=\nR\n\u2297\nM.\nFrom\nProposij\nj\nR\nj=1 j\ntions 1.2 and 1.3, Mj has a pure-composition series:\n0 \u2282 M1,j \u2282 * * * \u2282 Mnj ,j = Mj ,\nwith cyclic factors. Then the chain (c):\n0 \u2282 M1,1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Mn1 ,1 = M1 \u2282 M1 \u2295 M1,2 \u2282 * * * \u2282 M1 \u2295 M2 \u2282 . . .\n* * * \u2282 M1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Mm\u22121 \u2295 M1,m \u2282 * * * \u2282 M1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Mm = M\nis a pure-composition series of M, with cyclic factors. Let N be a factor of this\npure-composition series. Then N is a module over an indecomposable factor ring\nR\u2032 of R. When R\u2032 is a domain and annR\u2032 (N ) = {0}, or when R\u2032 is a semitorch ring\nand annR\u2032 (N ) \u2286 Q, where Q is the minimal prime of R\u2032 , N is indecomposable. In\nthe other cases, R/ann(N ) is semilocal. Since each semilocal arithmetic ring has\nonly finitely many minimal prime ideals which are pairwise comaximal, it follows\nthat N is a finite direct sum of indecomposable cyclic modules. Consequently, we\ndeduce from (c) a pure-composition series of M, with indecomposable cyclic factors.\n\n\f6\n\nFRAN\u00c7OIS COUCHOT\n\nIt is sufficient to prove that Mj has a finite Goldie dimension for every j, 1 \u2264\nj \u2264 m. We may assume that R is indecomposable. First, we suppose that M is\ncyclic. When R is a domain and ann(M ) = {0}, or when R is a semitorch ring\nand ann(M ) \u2286 Q, where Q is the minimal prime of R, we have g(M ) = 1. In the\nother cases R/ann(M ) is a semilocal ring. We may assume that R is semilocal. Let\n(Si )i\u2208I be a family of independant submodules of M such that \u2295i\u2208I Si is essential\nin M. For every maximal ideal P , MP is a uniserial RP -module and consequently\nthere is at most one index i in I such that (Si )P 6= {0}. It follows that I is a\nfinite set. Hence M has a finite Goldie dimension. In the general case, let N be a\nsubmodule of M such that \u03bc(N ) = \u03bc(M ) \u2212 1 and M/N is cyclic.The inclusion map\nN \u2192 E(N ) can be extended to w : M \u2192 E(N ). Let f : M \u2192 E(N ) \u2295 E(M/N )\ndefined by f (x) = (w(x), x + N ), for each x \u2208 M. It is easy to verify that f is a\nmonomorphism. It follows that g(M ) \u2264 g(N ) + g(M/N ). By induction on \u03bc(M ),\nwe complete the proof.\n\u0003\nIf R is a B\u00e9zout semi-CF-ring and N an indecomposable cyclic R-module, then\nJ = rad(ann(N )) = {r \u2208 R | \u2203p \u2208 N, such that rp \u2208 ann(N )} is the minimal\nprime ideal over ann(N ). For every finitely generated module M, from each purecomposition series of M, with indecomposable cyclic factors, we can associate a\nsequence of prime ideals. Then we have the following proposition:\nProposition 2.3. Let R be B\u00e9zout semi-CF-ring, and M a finitely generated module. We consider two pure-composition series of M with indecomposable cyclic\nfactors:\n(s): {0} = M0 \u2282 M1 \u2282 M2 . . . * * * \u2282 Mn\u22121 \u2282 Mn = M.\n(s'): {0} = M0\u2032 \u2282 M1\u2032 \u2282 M2\u2032 . . . * * * \u2282 Mn\u2032 \u2032 \u22121 \u2282 Mn\u2032 \u2032 = M.\n\u2032\nWe denote Ai = ann(Mi /Mi\u22121 ), A\u2032i = ann(Mi\u2032 /Mi\u22121\n), Ji = rad(Ai ), Ji\u2032 =\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nrad(Ai ), S = (Ji )1\u2264i\u2264n and S = (Ji )1\u2264i\u2264n\u2032 .\nThen n = n\u2032 , and there exists \u03c3 in the symmetric group Sn such that J\u03c3(i) = Ji\u2032\nfor every i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n.\nProof. Let C be a maximal totally ordered subsequence of S and P a maximal\nideal of R containing every term of C. For each i such that Ji 6\u2286 P we have\n(Mi )P = (Mi\u22121 )P , and for each i such that Ji \u2286 P we have (Mi )P \u2283 (Mi\u22121 )P .\nWe deduce from (s) a pure-composition series of MP , with cyclic factors, whose the\nlength is equal to the number of terms of C. By [12, Theorem 1.6, p. 177], the\npure-composition series of MP , deduced from (s) and (s') are isomorphic, and this\nconclusion holds for each maximal ideal P containing all terms of C. Consequently\nthere is a maximal totally ordered subsequence C \u2032 of S \u2032 , which has the same terms\nas C. Conversely, the same conclusion holds for every maximal totally ordered\nsubsequence of S \u2032 . Therefore S and S \u2032 have the same terms, eventually with different\nindices.\n\u0003\nWe will say that a sequence of ideals (Ai )1\u2264i\u2264n is almost totally ordered if Ai\nand Aj are either comparable, or comaximal, \u2200i, \u2200j, 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n, and that this\nsequence is almost increasing if either Ai \u2286 Aj , or Ai and Aj are comaximal, \u2200i, \u2200j,\n1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n, . Let us observe that every sequence of prime ideals of an arithmetic\nring is almost totally ordered.\n\n\fMODULES WITH RD-COMPOSITION SERIES OVER A COMMUTATIVE RING\n\n7\n\nIn the sequel, if R is a B\u00e9zout semi-CF-ring and M a finitely generated Rmodule, we denote l(M ) the length of every pure-composition series of M, with\nindecomposable cyclic factors.\nProposition 2.4. Let R be a B\u00e9zout semi-CF-ring, and M a finitely generated\nR-module. Then the following assertions are true:\n(1) From every pure-composition series of M, with indecomposable cyclic factors, we deduce a pure-composition series with an almost increasing annihilator sequence.\n(2) Any two pure-composition series of M, with indecomposable cyclic factors\nand almost totally ordered annihilator sequences, are isomorphic.\nProof.\n(1) We consider the following pure-composition series of M, with indecomposable\ncyclic factors,\n(s) :0 = M0 \u2282 M1 \u2282 M2 . . . * * * \u2282 Mn\u22121 \u2282 Mn = M,\nwhere Mi /Mi\u22121 = R(xi + Mi\u22121 ).\nWe denote Ai = ann(Mi /Mi\u22121 ) and S the sequence of prime ideals associated\nto M. We put S = (Ji )1\u2264i\u2264n .\nWe claim that, after a possible permutation of indices, we may assume that S is\nalmost increasing. To prove this, we induct on n. If n = 1, it is obvious. Suppose\nn > 1. Let C be a maximal totally ordered subsequence of S, and S \u2032 the subsequence\nof all terms of S which are not terms of C. If C = S the claim is obvious. We may\nassume that C 6= S. Clearly, if Ji is a term of C and Jk a term of S \u2032 , then Ji \u2282 Jk\nor Ji and Jk are comaximal. Since the induction hypothesis can be applied to S \u2032 ,\nthen it is possible to get an almost increasing sequence, if we begin to index the\nterms of C and we end with the terms of S \u2032 .\nWe will prove, by induction on n = l(M ), that we can get a pure-composition\nseries (t) of M, with indecomposable cyclic factors: {0} \u2282 N1 \u2282 . . . Nn\u22121 \u2282 M, with\nan almost increasing annihilator sequence (Bi )1\u2264i\u2264n and such that rad(Bi ) = Ji ,\nfor each i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n.\nIf n = 1, this is obvious. We assume that n > 1. Let k be the smallest index\nsuch that rad(Ak ) = Jn . If k < n, one of the five following cases holds:\n(a): rad(Ak+1 ) and Jn are comaximal. It follows that Ak and Ak+1 are also\ncomaximal. Therefore, for every maximal ideal P, we have (Mk+1 /Mk )P = {0} or\n(Mk /Mk\u22121 )P = {0}. Hence Mk+1 /Mk\u22121 is cyclic and its annihilator is Ak \u2229 Ak+1 .\nThen Mk+1 /Mk\u22121 \u2243 R/(Ak \u2229 Ak+1 ) \u2243 R/Ak \u2295 R/Ak+1 . Hence Mk+1 /Mk\u22121 =\nR(x\u2032k + Mk\u22121 ) \u2295 R(x\u2032k+1 + Mk\u22121 ), where ann(x\u2032k + Mk\u22121 ) = Ak and ann(x\u2032k+1 +\nMk\u22121 ) = Ak+1 . Therefore Mk can be replaced with Mk\u2032 = Mk\u22121 + Rx\u2032k+1 , where\nann(Mk\u2032 /Mk\u22121 ) = Ak+1 and Ak = ann(Mk+1 /Mk\u2032 ). Then we replace k with (k + 1)\nfor the next step.\n(b): rad(Ak+1 ) \u2282 Jn . By applying [3, Lemma 3.1] to R/(Ak \u2229 Ak+1 ), we get\nthat Ak+1 \u2282 Ak . With the same proof as in [12, Lemma 1.3 p.172], we state that\nMk+1 /Mk\u22121 = Mk /Mk\u22121 \u2295 R(xk+1 + Mk\u22121 ). Therefore Mk can be replaced with\nMk\u2032 = Mk\u22121 + Rxk+1 , where ann(Mk\u2032 /Mk\u22121 ) = Ak+1 \u2282 Ak = ann(Mk+1 /Mk\u2032 ).\nThen we replace k with (k + 1) for the next step.\n(c): rad(Ak+1 ) = Jn and Ak \u2286 Ak+1 . Then we replace k with (k + 1) for the\nnext step.\n(d): rad(Ak+1 ) = Jn and Ak+1 \u2282 Ak . We do as in the case (b).\n\n\f8\n\nFRAN\u00c7OIS COUCHOT\n\n(e): rad(Ak+1 ) = Jn and Ak+1 is not comparable with Ak . By applying Proposition 1.2 or 1.3 to Mk+1 /Mk\u22121 , it follows that there exists a pure submodule\nMk\u2032 of Mk+1 , containing Mk\u22121 , such that Mk\u2032 /Mk\u22121 and Mk+1 /Mk\u2032 are cyclic and\nann(Mk\u2032 /Mk\u22121 ) = Ak \u2229 Ak+1 . For every maximal ideal P , {(Ak )P , (Ak+1 )P } =\n{(Ak \u2229 Ak+1 )P , (Ak + Ak+1 )P }. By using [12, Theorem 1.6, p.177], it follows that\nthe annihilator of Mk+1 /Mk\u2032 is Ak + Ak+1 . Therefore Mk can be replaced with Mk\u2032 .\nThen we replace k with (k + 1) for the next step.\nAfter (n \u2212 k) similar steps, we get from (s), a pure-composition series (s') of M,\n\u2032\n{0} \u2282 M1\u2032 * * * \u2282 Mn\u22121\n\u2282 Mn\u2032 = M, with the annihilator sequence (A\u2032i )1\u2264i\u2264n , and\n\u2032\nsuch that rad(An ) = Jn . Let us observe that, if rad(A\u2032k ) = Jn , then A\u2032k \u2286 A\u2032n , for\neach k, 1 \u2264 k < n. Hence, either A\u2032i \u2286 A\u2032n , or A\u2032i and A\u2032n are comaximal, for each\ni, 1 \u2264 i < n.\n\u2032\nNow l(Mn\u22121\n) = n \u2212 1 and (Ji )1\u2264i<n is the sequence of prime ideals associated\n\u2032\n\u2032\nto Mn\u22121 . Moreover, (s') induces a pure-composition series (s\") of Mn\u22121\n, with the\n\u2032\nannihilator sequence (Ai )1\u2264i<n . From the induction hypothesis, we get from (s\"),\n\u2032\n\u2032\na pure-composition series (t') of Mn\u22121\n, {0} \u2282 N1 \u2282 . . . Nn\u22121 = Mn\u22121\n, with an\nalmost increasing annihilator sequence (Bi )1\u2264i<n such that Ji = rad(Bi ), for every\ni, 1 \u2264 i < n. We put Bn = A\u2032n . From the above observation, it follows that\n(Bi )1\u2264i\u2264n is an almost increasing sequence.\nLet us observe that the case (e) is not possible if (Ai )1\u2264i\u2264n is almost totally\nordered. In this case, (s) and (t) are isomorphic.\n(2) We consider two pure-composition series of M, with indecomposable cyclic\nfactors and almost totally ordered annihilator sequences:\n(s): {0} = M0 \u2282 M1 \u2282 M2 . . . * * * \u2282 Mn\u22121 \u2282 Mn = M.\n(s'):{0} = M0\u2032 \u2282 M1\u2032 \u2282 M2\u2032 . . . * * * \u2282 Mn\u2032 \u2032 \u22121 \u2282 Mn\u2032 = M.\n\u2032\nWe denote Ai = ann(Mi /Mi\u22121 ) and A\u2032i = ann(Mi\u2032 /Mi\u22121\n). From (1) we may\nassume that the annihilator sequences are almost increasing and that rad(Ai ) =\nrad(A\u2032i ) = Ji , \u2200i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. Let P be a maximal ideal of R. If Ji \u2286 P, then by\n[12, Theorem 1.6, p.117], (Ai )P = (A\u2032i )P . If Ji 6\u2286 P, then (Ai )P = (A\u2032i )P = RP .\nTherefore Ai = A\u2032i , for every i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n.\n\u0003\nNow, we can prove the implication (1) \u21d2 (2) of Theorem 2.1.\nProof of Theorem 2.1. (1) \u21d2 (2). By [3, Corollary 3.9], every pure-composition\nseries of a finitely generated R-module, with indecomposable cyclic factors, has an\nalmost totally ordered annihilator sequence. Hence the result follows from Proposition 2.2 and Proposition 2.4.\n\u0003\nThe following propositions are needed to prove the implication (2) \u21d2 (1) of\nTheorem 2.1. Now we suppose that R is a PCS-ring and if M is a finitely generated\nmodule, we denote l(M ) the length of every pure-composition series of M with\nindecomposable cyclic factors.\nProposition 2.5. Let R be a PCS-ring. The following assertions are true:\n(1) For each indecomposable cyclic module N, g(N ) = 1\n(2) For every finitely generated R-module M, g(M ) \u2264 l(M ).\nProof.\n(1) Since N \u2243 R/ann(N ), we can replace R with R/ann(N ) and assume that\nR is an indecomposable module. Let I and J be ideals of R such that\nI \u2229 J = {0}. Then R/I \u2295 R/J is a finite direct sum of indecomposable\n\n\fMODULES WITH RD-COMPOSITION SERIES OVER A COMMUTATIVE RING\n\n9\n\ncyclic modules. If I 6= {0} and J 6= {0} then every annihilator of each\nsummand of R/I \u2295 R/J is a nonzero ideal. On the other hand we consider\nthe following exact sequence :\n\u03c6\n\u03c3\n(i) 0 \u2192 R \u2192 R/I \u2295 R/J \u2192 R/(I + J) \u2192 0 such that \u03c3(r) = (r + I, r + J)\nand \u03c6(r + I, t + J) = (r \u2212 t) + (I + J). Let P be a maximal ideal of R. Then\nwe may assume that IP \u2286 JP , and, if r(x + IP , y + JP ) = (z + IP , z + JP ), it\nis obvious that r(x + IP , x + JP ) = (z + IP , z + JP ). Hence RP is isomorphic\nto a pure RP -submodule of (R/I \u2295 R/J)P . We deduce that (i) is a pure\nexact sequence, and from a pure-composition series of R/(I + J), we get a\npure-composition series of R/I \u2295 R/J such that the first annihilator is {0}.\nConsequently, if I 6= {0} and J 6= {0}, R/I \u2295R/J has two pure-composition\nseries which are not isomorphic. Since R is a PCS-ring, we deduce that R\nis a uniform module and that g(R) = 1.\n(2) By induction on n = l(M ). If n = 1 the result follows from (1). Now\nsuppose n > 1. Let {0} \u2282 M1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Mn\u22121 \u2282 Mn = M be a purecomposition series of M, with indecomposable cyclic factors. As in the proof\nof Proposition 2.2, we get that g(M ) \u2264 g(Mn\u22121 )+1, because g(M/Mn\u22121 ) =\n1. Since l(Mn\u22121 ) = n \u2212 1, it follows from the induction hypothesis that\ng(M ) \u2264 n.\n\u0003\nProposition 2.6. Let R be a PCS-ring. Then R has only finitely many minimal\nprime ideals.\nProof. We may assume that R is a reduced ring. If S denotes the total ring of\nquotients of R, then by [14, Proposition 2, p. 106], S is a Von Neumann regular\nring. By Proposition 2.5, g(R) is finite. We deduce from [14, Proposition\nQ 2, p.\n103] that S is semi-local. Consequently S is a semi-simple ring, i.e. S = ni=1 Ki ,\nwhere Ki is a field for every i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. If u : R \u2192 S is the natural map, and,\n\u2200i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, pi : S \u2192 Ki theTcanonical epimorphism, we denote Pi = ker(pi \u25e6 u).\nn\nThen Pi is a prime ideal and i=1 Pi = {0}. We deduce that {Pi | 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n} is\nthe set of minimal prime ideals of R.\n\u0003\nProposition 2.7. Let R be a PCS-ring with a unique minimal prime ideal Q. Then\nQ is a uniserial module.\nProof. If there exist a and b in Q such that a \u2208\n/ Rb and b \u2208\n/ Ra, then R/(Ra \u2229\nRb) is indecomposable with g(R/(Ra \u2229 Rb)) \u2265 2. From Proposition 2.5, we get a\ncontradiction.\n\u0003\nProposition 2.8. Let R be a PCS-ring. Then every nonminimal prime ideal is\ncontained in only one maximal ideal.\nProof. We do a similar proof as in [11, Lemma 10]. By Proposition 2.6, R\nhas only finitely many minimal prime ideals. Since R is arithmetic, these minimal\nprime ideals are pairwise comaximal and consequently R is a finite product of\nindecomposable PCS-rings with a unique minimal prime. Hence we may assume\nthat R has only one minimal prime ideal Q. Let P be a prime ideal such that Q \u2282 P\nand a \u2208 P \\ Q. Then, from [3, Lemma 3.1], it follows that Q \u2282 Ra. We may also\nassume that P is minimal over Ra. Suppose that P \u2286 M1 \u2229 M2 where M1 and M2\nare two distinct maximal ideals of R. Let x1 and x2 in R, xi \u2208 Mj \\ Mi , i 6= j,\nsuch that x1 + x2 = 1. If S = R \\ (M1 \u222a M2 ), we denote R\u2032 = S \u22121 R. Then\nami\nwhere mi \u2208 Mi and s \u2208 S.

Now we consider\nwe get a contradiction. Let I = aM1 \u2229 aM2 . Then\n1\nR1 = R/I. Then R1 is also a finite product of indecomposable rings with a unique\nminimal prime ideal. Hence we may assume that P1 = P/I is the only minimal\nprime ideal of R1 . Then, if S1 = R1 \\ (M1 /I \u222a M2 /I) we have S1\u22121 R1 \u2243 R\u2032 /R\u2032 I.\nConsequently axi + I 6= I, \u2200i, i \u2208 {1, 2}. Since R is a B\u00e9zout ring and x1 + x2 =\n1, Rax1 \u2229 Rax2 = Rax1 x2 . We deduce that R1 (ax1 + I) \u2229 R1 (ax2 + I) = {0}. This\ncontradicts that P1 is uniserial by Proposition 2.7.\n\u0003\nNow, we complete the proof of Theorem 2.1.\nProof of Theorem 2.1. (2) \u21d2 (1). By Proposition 1.1, R is a B\u00e9zout ring.\nWe deduce from Propositions 2.6, 2.7 and 2.8 and from [3, Theorem 3.12] that R\nis also a CF-ring.\n\u0003\nIt is easy to get a semilocal arithmetic ring R which is not a PCS-ring.\nExample 2.9. Let D a semilocal and h-local B\u00e9zout domain, F its classical field\nof quotients,\u0012P and\nQ two distinct maximal ideals of D, E = (F/P DP ) \u2295 (F/QDQ )\no\nn d e\u0013\n| d \u2208 D, e \u2208 E the trivial extension of D by E. Then R is a\nand R =\n0 d\nsemilocal arithmetic ring with a unique minimal prime ideal which is not uniserial.\nBy Proposition 2.7, R is not a PCS-ring.\nExample 2.10. Let R be the Kaplansky domain of [15, example 1] . We may\nassume that R is semilocal and nonlocal. Then its Jacobson radical is a nonzero\nprime ideal contained in every maximal ideal. Since R is not h-local, R is not a\nPCS-ring.\nThe following questions can be proposed :\nLet R be a ring such that every finitely generated R-module has a pure-composition\nseries with indecomposable cyclics factors.\n(1) Is g(M ) finite, for every finitely generated R-module M ?\n(2) Is M inspec(R) a finite set ? M inspec(R) denotes the set of minimal prime\nideals of R.\n(3) For every finitely generated R-module M, are the lengths of any two purecomposition series of M, with indecomposable cyclic factors, equal?\nLet us observe that, if the answer to the question (1) is positive, then M inspec(R)\nis finite (see the proof of Proposition 2.6), and if M inspec(R/I) is finite, for every\nproper ideal I, then the question (3) also has a positive answer (see the proof of\nProposition 2.3.)\nWhen M inspec(R) is compact in its Zariski topology, we can answer to the\nquestion (2).\nProposition 2.11. Let R be an arithmetic ring. We suppose that M inspec(R)\nis compact and every finitely generated module has a pure-composition series with\nindecomposable cyclic factors.\nThen M inspec(R) is a finite set.\nProof. Since R has a pure-composition series with indecomposable cyclic factors, R is a finite direct product of indecomposable Kaplansky rings. We may\n\n\fMODULES WITH RD-COMPOSITION SERIES OVER A COMMUTATIVE RING\n\n11\n\nassume that R is semi-prime and indecomposable. Since RP is a valuation domain for every maximal ideal P, by [16, Proposition 10], R is semi-hereditary. Let\nr \u2208 R, r 6= 0. Since ann(r) is generated by an idempotent, ann(r) = {0}. Hence R\nis a domain.\n\u0003\nWe can answer to these questions when R is a Von Neumann regular ring. Then\nevery exact short sequence of R-modules is pure. It follows that every finitely\ngenerated R-module has a pure-composition series with cyclic factors. However, we\nhave the following result.\nProposition 2.12. Let R be a Von Neumann regular ring. Then the following\nstatements are true.\n(1) A finitely generated R-module has a pure-composition series with indecomposable cyclic factors if and only if it is a semi-simple module.\n(2) Every finitely generated R-module has a pure-composition series with indecomposable cyclic factors if and only if R is a semi-simple ring.\nProof. Clearly (1) \u21d2 (2). We can also deduce (2) from Proposition 2.11. (1) is\nan immediate consequence of the following Theorem.\n\u0003\nTheorem 2.13. Let R be a ring. Then the following assertions are equivalent :\n(1) R is a Von Neumann regular ring.\n(2) Every indecomposable R-module is simple.\nProof. (2) \u21d2 (1). For every simple R-module S, ER (S) \u2243 S. Since every simple\nR-module is injective, we deduce that R is Von Neumann regular.\n(1) \u21d2 (2). Let M be an indecomposable R-module, M 6= {0}. Then there exists\na maximal ideal P such that MP 6= {0}. Let a \u2208 P. Then there exists an idempotent\ne such that Ra = Re. Since MP 6= {0} and (1 \u2212 e) \u2208\n/ P, we have (1 \u2212 e)M 6= {0}.\nWe deduce that eM = {0} since M is indecomposable. Consequently M is an\nR/P -module. Since R/P is a field, M is a simple module.\n\u0003\nBy using this theorem, we can also answer to the following question proposed\nby R. Wiegand in [17] : are the following assertions equivalent for a commutative\nring R and an integer n \u2265 1 ?\n(1) Every finitely generated R-module is a finite direct sum of submodules\ngenerated by at most n elements.\n(2) \u03bc(M ) \u2264 n, for every indecomposable finitely generated R-module M.\nIf R is a Von Neumann regular ring, then R satisfies the second assertion by\nTheorem 2.13, with n = 1. But if R satisfies the first assertion, then R is semisimple by [18, Corollary 21.7] . Consequently the answer to Wiegand's question is\nnegative.\n3. The Goldie dimension\nIn this section we will prove the following theorem.\nTheorem 3.1. Let R be a PCS-ring. Then a finitely generated R-module M is a\ndirect sum of cyclic submodules if and only if g(M ) = l(M ).\nWhen R is a valuation ring this theorem was proved by L. Salce and P. Zanardo\n[1, Corollary 3.5], and when R is an h-local B\u00e9zout domain, it was proved by C.\nNaud\u00e9 [2, Theorem 2.2].

From\nLemma 3.2, it follows that ai \u2208 Q, \u2200i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, whence y \u2208 QM. If P \u2032 is a\nmaximal ideal, P \u2032 6= P, then MP \u2032 \u2243 (M/QM )P \u2032 and consequently RP \u2032 y = {0}.\nSince Ry 6= {0}, we get a contradiction.\nSince RP y 6= {0}, RP y \u2229 MP\u2032 = {0} and RP is a valuation ring, it follows that\nRP z \u2229 MP\u2032 = {0}.\nSince R is a Kaplansky ring, there exists an invertible n \u00d7 n matrix \u039b such that\n[b1 , . . . , bn ]\u039b = [1, 0, . . . , 0].\nThen z = [b1 , . . . , bn ][x1 , . . . , xn ]t = [b1 , . . . , bn ]\u039b\u039b\u22121 [x1 , . . . , xn ]t .\nHence z = [1, 0, . . . , 0]\u039b\u22121 [x1 , . . . , xn ]t .

Then {zi + QM | 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n} is a basis of M/QM, and for every\nmaximal ideal P \u2032 , P 6= P \u2032 , we have MP \u2032 = (Rz1 )P \u2032 \u2295 NP \u2032 .\nWe put \u039b = (\u03bbi,k )1\u2264i,k\u2264n .

Since\nMP\u2032 \u2229 RP z1 = {0}, we also get that RP z1 \u2295 NP = MP .\n\u0003\nLemma 3.4. Let R be a B\u00e9zout and a torch ring and Q its minimal prime ideal.\nLet M be a finitely generated module and {0} \u2282 M1 \u2282 M2 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Mn = M\na pure-composition series with Mi /Mi\u22121 = R(xi + Mi\u22121 ) for all i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n,\nand with an increasing annihilator sequence (Ai )1\u2264i\u2264n .

If\nM/Mn\u22121 = R(x\u2032n +Mn\u22121 )\u2295R(x\"n +Mn\u22121 ), where R(x\u2032n +Mn\u22121 ) is indecomposable,\nwe set M \u2032 = Mn\u22121 + Rx\"n .\nIf M \u2032 is not essential in M, then M has a nonzero cyclic summand.\nProof. There exists y \u2208 M \\M \u2032 such that M \u2032 \u2229Ry = {0}. Let A\u2032 = ann(M/M \u2032 ).\nThen An \u2286 A\u2032 and there exists only one maximal ideal P such that A\u2032 \u2286 P.\nTherefore, if P \u2032 is a maximal ideal, P \u2032 6= P, we have (M/M \u2032 )P \u2032 = {0}. It follows\nthat there exists s \u2208\n/ P \u2032 such that sx\u2032n \u2208 M \u2032 . We also get that sy \u2208 M \u2032 and since\n\u2032\nM \u2229 Ry = {0}, we have sy = 0. Consequently RP \u2032 y = {0} and MP\u2032 \u2032 = MP \u2032 for\nevery maximal ideal P \u2032 6= P.\nPn\nThere exist a1 , . . . , an in R such that y = i=1 ai xi . As in the previous lemma,\nthere exist a, b1 , . . . , bn such that ai = abi for every i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, and such that\nP\nn\n/ A\u2032 , else L\ny \u2208 M \u2032 . Since a \u2208\n/ Q and R/Q is an h-local B\u00e9zout\ni=1 Rbi = R. Then a \u2208\nm\ndomain, it follows that R/Ra = j=1 R/Rcj , where R/Rcj is indecomposable for\nevery j, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m. We denote Pj the only maximal ideal of R such that Rcj \u2286 Pj ,\nfor each j, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m.\nIf P 6= Pj for each j, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m, then a is a unit of RP . In this case we set z = y\nand di = ai , for every i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n.\nIf there exists j, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m, such that P = Pj , then we put c = cj . There\nexists d \u2208 R such that a = cd, and\nPn d is a unit of RP . We set di = bi d, for every\ni, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, and we put z = i=1 di xi . For every maximal ideal P \u2032 6= P, c is\na unit of RP \u2032 , whence RP \u2032 z = RP \u2032 y = {0}. Since MP\u2032 \u2229 RP y = {0} and RP is a\nvaluation ring, it follows that RP z \u2229 MP\u2032 = {0}.\nIn the two cases, there exists j, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n, such that dj is a unit of RP . Let\nl be the greatest index such that Al \u2286 Q. We claim that l < j. Else there exist\nt \u2208 P RP , and d\u2032l+1 , . . . , d\u2032n \u2208 RP such that di = td\u2032i for every i, l < i \u2264 n. Let\nPn\ns \u2208 RP A\u2032 \\ RP Q. Then sz = 0.

From Lemma 3.2 it follows that s(td\u2032i + di ) \u2208\nRP Al \u2286 RP Q, for every i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 l. Since s \u2208\n/ RP Q and t \u2208 P RP , we deduce that\ndi \u2208 P RP for every i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 l.

Consequently we get M = N \u2295 Rz.\n\u0003\nProposition 3.5. Let R be a B\u00e9zout and a torch ring. Then every finitely Rmodule M contains a pure and essential submodule B which is a direct sum of\ng(M ) cyclic modules.\nProof. We induct on m = l(M ). The case m = 1 is obvious. Let m > 1 and\n{0} \u2282 M1 * * * \u2282 Mn = M be a pure-composition series with cyclic factors and\nan increasing annihilator sequence (Ai )1\u2264i\u2264n . Let Q be the minimal prime of R.\nIf An \u2286 Q, then n = m and we set M \u2032 = Mn\u22121 . If Q \u2282 An , then M/Mn\u22121 =\nR(x\u2032n + Mn\u22121 ) \u2295 R(x\"n + Mn\u22121 ) where R(x\u2032n + Mn\u22121 ) is indecomposable ; in this\ncase we set M \u2032 = Mn\u22121 + Rx\"n . In the two cases, l(M \u2032 ) = m \u2212 1.\nIf M \u2032 is essential, M \u2032 has a pure and essential submodule B \u2032 which is a direct\nsum of g(M \u2032 ) non-zero indecomposable cyclic modules ; in this case, we are done\nby setting B = B \u2032 .\nIf M \u2032 is not essential, then by Lemma 3.3 or Lemma 3.4, M = N \u2295 Rz, for\nsome z \u2208 M, z 6= 0, where Rz is indecomposable and N a submodule of M. Then\nl(N ) = m \u2212 1. Thus N has a pure and essential submodule B\" which is a direct\nsum of g(N ) non-zero indecomposable cyclic submodules. We put B = B\" \u2295 Rz to\nconclude the proof.\n\u0003\nNow we can prove the Theorem 3.1.\nProof of Theorem 3.1. By Proposition 2.5, the Goldie dimension of every\ncyclic indecomposable module is one. Consequently if M is a finite direct sum of\ncyclic modules, we have l(M ) = g(M ).\nConversely let M be\nQ a finitely generated module such that l(M ) = g(M ). By\nProposition 2.6, R = m\nis an indecomposable PCS-ring for every\nj=1 Rj , where Rj Q\nm\nj, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m. We deduce that M \u2243 j=1 Mj , where Mj = Rj \u2297R M. Then\nPm\nPm\nl(M ) = j=1 l(Mj ) and g(M ) = j=1 g(Mj ). From Proposition 2.5, we deduce\nthat l(Mj ) = g(Mj ) for every j, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m. Consequently we may assume that R\nis indecomposable. When R is a valuation ring, the result was proved by L. Salce\nand P. Zanardo [1, Corollary 3.5], (or [12, Theorem 2.4, p. 180]), and when R is\nan h-local B\u00e9zout domain, it was proved by C. Naud\u00e9 [2, Theorem 2.2.]. Hence\nwe may assume that R is a B\u00e9zout and torch ring. We prove the result by using\nProposition 3.5 and Proposition 2.5, with the same proof as in [12, Theorem 2.4,\np. 180].\n\u0003\nLet R be a B\u00e9zout semi-CF-ring, M a finitely generated R-module and (s) :\n{0} = M0 \u2282 M1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Mn\u22121 \u2282 Mn = M, a pure-composition series of M, with\n\n\fMODULES WITH RD-COMPOSITION SERIES OVER A COMMUTATIVE RING\n\n15\n\nPn\nindecomposable cyclic factors. We put g((s)) = i=1 g(Mi /Mi\u22121 ). As in the proof\nof Proposition 2.5, we state that g(M ) \u2264 g((s)).\nHowever, if (s\u2032 ) is another pure-composition series of M, with indecomposable\ncyclic factors, we have not necessarely g((s)) = g((s\u2032 )). For instance:\nExample 3.6. Let R \u0012be the\nring defined in example 2.9. We put E1 = F/P DP ,\no\nn 0 e\u0013\nE2 = F/QDQ , Ai =\n| e \u2208 Ei , where i = 1 or 2, and J = A1 + A2 . Then\n0 0\nA1 \u2229 A2 = {0} and J is the minimal prime ideal of R. Let M = R/A1 \u2295 R/A2 and\n(s) be the pure-composition series with the annihilator sequence (A1 , A2 ). Then\ng(M ) = g((s)) = 2. But M has a pure-composition series (s\u2032 ) whose factors are R\nand R/J. We have g((s\u2032 )) = 3. Let us observe that M is not isomorphic to R \u2295 R/J.\nIf M is a finitely generated module over a B\u00e9zout semi-CF-ring R, we denote\nS(M ) the set of all pure-composition series of M, with indecomposable cyclic factors, and we put h(M ) = inf {g((s)) | (s) \u2208 S(M )}. Then we have the following\nproposition:\nProposition 3.7. Let R be a B\u00e9zout semi-CF-ring and M a finitely generated\nR-module. Then the following assertions are true:\n(1) \u03bc(M ) \u2264 l(M ) \u2264 h(M ).\n(2) g(M ) \u2264 h(M ).\n(3) If M is a direct sum of cyclic modules, then g(M ) = h(M ).\nWe don't know if the converse of the third assertion holds.\n4. Pure-injectivity and RD-injectivity\nFirst, for every integer n \u2265 2, we give an example of an artinian module M\nover a noetherian domain R, which has an RD-composition series of length n, with\nuniserial factors.\nExample 4.1. Let K be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0, K[X, Y ]\nthe polynomial ring in two variables X and Y, and f (X, Y ) = Y n \u2212X n (1+X), where\nn \u2208 N, n \u2265 2. By considering that f (X, Y ) is a polynomial in one variable Y with\ncoefficients in K[X], it follows from Eisenstein's criterion that f (X, Y ) is irreducible.\nK[X, Y ]\nis a domain. Let x and y be the images of X and Y in\nThen R =\nf (X, Y )K[X, Y ]\nb is the\nR by the natural map and P the maximal ideal of R generated by {x, y}. If R\nK[[X, Y ]]\nb\u2243\ncompletion of R in its P -adic topology, then R\n. Since K has n\nf (X, Y )K[[X, Y ]]\ndistinct n-th roots of unity, by applying Hensel's Lemma to K[[X]],\nQn we deduce that\nthere exist u1 (X), . . . , un (X) in K[[X]] such that f (X, Y ) = i=1 (Y \u2212 Xui (X)).\nb E is also an injective R-module\nb\nLet E = ER (R/P ). Then by [19], EndR E = R,\nb\nand every R-submodule of E is also an R-submodule. Moreover, there is a bijection\nb and the set of submodules of E. For every k, 1 \u2264 k \u2264\nbetween the set of ideals of R\nb\nb and Qk \u2229 R = {0}.\nn, Qk = (y \u2212 xuk (x))R is a minimal prime ideal of R,\nb k \u2243\nFor every k, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n, let Fk = {e \u2208 E | Qk \u2286 annRb (e)}. Then R/Q\nK[[Z]], and consequently it is a discrete valuation domain. We deduce that Fk is\nb k -module, it follows that Fk\na uniserial R-module. Since Fk is an injective R/Q\nPk\nis a divisible R-module for every k, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n. We set Ek = i=1 Fi for every\n\n\f16\n\nFRAN\u00c7OIS COUCHOT\n\nTk\nk, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n. Then annRb (Ek ) = i=1 Qi and consequently En = E. Moreover,\nEk /Ek\u22121 = (Ek\u22121 + Fk )/Ek\u22121 \u2243 Fk /(Fk \u2229 Ek\u22121 ). We deduce that Ek /Ek\u22121 is\na uniserial R-module, and since R is a domain it follows that Ek /Ek\u22121 is also\ndivisible. Consequently Ek is divisible over R, \u2200k, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n, and the following\nchain {0} \u2282 E1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 En\u22121 \u2282 En = E, is an RD-composition series of E, of\nlength n, with uniserial factors.\nNow, we give some examples of pure-injective modules that fail to be RDinjective, over noetherian domains.\nExample 4.2. Suppose that R, Fk and Ek , 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n, are defined as in the\nexample 4.1. Then, since Fk and Ek are artinian R-modules, they are also pureinjective by [7, Proposition 9]. Since E is indecomposable, Fk and Ek (k \u2264 n \u2212 1)\nare not RD-injective.\nRecall that an R-module M is linearly compact (in its discrete topology) if for\nevery family of cosets {xi + Mi | i \u2208 I}, with the finite intersection property, has a\nnon-void intersection.\nWe can also find a noetherian and linearly compact module M which is not\nRD-injective over a noetherian domain R.\nExample 4.3. Let R be a complete local regular noetherian domain R with Krull\ndimension n \u2265 2 (for example, R = K[[X1 , . . . , Xn ]], where K is a field). Then\nthere exists an exact sequence:\nu\n\nun\u22121\n\nu\n\n1\nn\nF0 ,\nFn\u22121 \u2212\u2192 Fn\u22122 . . . . . . F1 \u2212\u2192\n0 \u2212\u2192 Fn \u2212\u2192\n\nwhere Fi is a free module of finite rank, for every i, 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n, and such that Im\nun\u22121 is not a projective module. Since Im un\u22121 is a torsion-free R-module, then\nFn is an RD-submodule of Fn\u22121 , which is not RD-injective. We deduce that R is\na pure-injective module since it is a linearly compact module by [7, Proposition 9],\nthat fails to be RD-injective.\nIt is proved in [4, Theorem 3.1] that a domain R is Pr\u00fcfer, i.e. arithmetic, if and\nonly if every pure-injective module is RD-injective. This result can be extended to\nevery commutative ring.\nTheorem 4.4. Let R be a commutative ring. Then the following assertions are\nequivalent :\n(1) R is an arithmetic ring.\n(2) Every RD-exact sequence of R-modules is pure-exact.\n(3) Every pure-injective R-module is RD-injective.\nProof. (1) \u21d2 (2) follows from [8, Theorem 3]. (2) \u21d2 (3) is obvious. (3) \u21d2 (1)\nis an immediate consequence of the following proposition.\n\u0003\nProposition 4.5. Let R be a commutative ring. If R is not arithmetic, there\nexists a pure-injective module which is not RD-injective. More precisely, there exist\na maximal ideal P, and two elements a and b in P, such that S = {x \u2208 ER (R/P ) |\nax = 0 and bx = 0} is a pure-injective module which is not RD-injective.\n\n\fMODULES WITH RD-COMPOSITION SERIES OVER A COMMUTATIVE RING\n\n17\n\nProof. There exists a maximal ideal P such that RP is not a valuation ring. Let\na and b in P such that a \u2208\n/ RP b and b \u2208\n/ RP a. By [8, Theorem 2], there exists an\nindecomposable finitely presented RP -module M, generated by two elements x1 and\nx2 , with the relation ax1 = bx2 . By [7, Corollary 2], M is not an RD-projective RP \u03c6\nmodule. Consequently there exists an RD-exact sequence 0 \u2192 L \u2192 N \u2192 M \u2192 0\nwhich is not pure-exact, where N is an RD-projective RP -module. We consider the\nu\nv\nfollowing presentation of M : 0 \u2192 RP \u2192 F \u2192 M \u2192 0, where F is a free RP module with basis {e1 , e2 }, such that v(ei ) = xi , i = 1, 2 and u(1) = ae1 \u2212be2. Since\nF is a free module there exists \u03b1 : F \u2192 N such that \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03b1 = v and consequently\nIm(\u03b1 \u25e6 u) \u2286 L. Then a\u03b1(e1 ) \u2212 b\u03b1(e2 ) \u2208\n/ aL + bL. Else there exist y1 and y2 in L\nsuch that ay1 \u2212 by2 = a\u03b1(e1 ) \u2212 b\u03b1(e2 ). We define \u03b2 : F \u2192 L by \u03b2(ei ) = yi . Then\n(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2)(ae1 \u2212 be2 ) = 0, whence (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2) induces an homomorphism \u03b3 : M \u2192 N such\nthat \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03b3 = 1M . This is not possible.\nConsequently if G = RP /(aRP + bRP ), then G \u2297RP L \u2192 G \u2297RP N is not injective. If E = ER (R/P ) \u2243 ERP (RP /P RP ), then E is an injective cogenerator in\nthe category of RP -modules, whence the homomorphism HomRP (G \u2297RP N, E) \u2192\nHomRP (G \u2297RP L, E) is not surjective. If S is the RP -module HomRP (G, E),\nthen S is pure-injective by [7, Proposition 7], but the morphism HomRP (N, S) \u2192\nHomRP (L, S) is not surjective, so S is not RD-injective over RP .\nBut S \u2243 HomR (R/(aR + bR), E) \u2243 {x \u2208 E | ax = 0 and bx = 0}, and S is also\na pure-injective R-module that fails to be RD-injective over R.\n\u0003\nWe deduce from this proposition the following example.\nExample 4.6. Let K be a field and R = K[X, Y ] the polynomial ring in two\nvariables X and Y. If we take a = X \u2212 \u03b1, b = Y \u2212 \u03b2, \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 K and P the maximal\nideal generated by a and b, then S is isomorphic to the simple R-module R/P. This\nis an example of a simple module which is not RD-injective over a domain R. Let\nus observe that S is finite if K is a finite field.\nReferences\n[1] Salce, L.; Zanardo, P.
