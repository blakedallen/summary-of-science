In the theory of general relativity, these solutions may be used as models for static (or slowly rotating) celestial objects\nwith no net electric charge. While in Einstein-Maxwell's theory they represent models for\nstatic objects with non-vanishing net electric charge.\nThe formation of a stable charged particle, in the framework of classical electrodynamics, is impossible. This is due to the fact that the field of an electric charge with a certain\nsign is repulsive. Many authors believe that the best classical description of elementary\nparticles is that of singularities in a combined electromagnetic-gravitational field (cf. [1]).\nOthers have the hope to explain the masses of charged particles by reducing them to the\nenergy of their electromagnetic fields [2]. This may lead to some developments in the\ntheory of elementary particles. A comprehensive theory of gravity and electromagnetism\nmay be very useful in discussing this problem, since the existence of a gravitational field\n(attractive) together with an electromagnetic field (repulsive) may lead to a stable charged\nparticle.\n1\n\nAstronomy Department, Faculty of Science, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt.\nE-mail:wanas@frcu.eun.eg\n\n1\n\n\fThe main problem with Einstein-Maxwell's theory is that the gravitational field and\nthe electromagnetic field are treated asymmetrically. The gravitational field has been\ngeometrized while the electromagnetic field is introduced as a vector field added to the\nsymmetric tensor field g\u03bc\u03bd of Riemannian geometry . There is no definite role for the\nadded field in the original geometry.\nIn the generalized field theory (GFT) [3], constructed by Mikhail and Wanas in\n1977,using Absolute Parallelism (AP)-geometry, the two fields have been treated, in a\ncomprehensive way, as one entity. All geometric elements, used to describe gravitational\nand electromagnetic quantities, are derived directly from the geometric structure used.\nThe theory has been applied to spherically symmetric cases [4],[5], [6]. The solutions obtained, so far, were found to be in agreement with previously known results, under some\nlimiting (particular) conditions.\nThe aim of the present work is to explore a further solution, with spherical symmetry.\nThis may throw some light on the previously stated problems. In section 2 the bases of\nthe geometric structure used for application is presented. A brief review of the GFT, the\nversion of AP-geometry used in its construction and a summary of its applications are\ngiven in section 3. A new solution of the field equation, of the GFT, is obtained in section\n4. Some of the electromagnetic and gravitational quantities are evaluated in section 5.\nThe results are discussed in section 6 and the paper is concluded in section 7.\n\n2\n\nSummary of a Version of AP-geometry\n\nIn the present section, a brief review of the conventional AP- geometry, first used by Einstein [7] and developed by Robertson [8] and Mikhail [9], is given. The geometry used to\nconstruct the GFT is a version AP-geometry. An AP-space is an affinely connected space,\neach point of which is labeled by a set of n-independent variables x\u03bd (\u03bd = 1, 2, 3, ....n). At\neach point we introduce n-linearly independent contravariant vectors \u03bb\u03bd ( i = 1, 2, 3, .....n).\ni\n\nWe denote by \u03bb\u03bc the normalized co-factor of \u03bb\u03bc in the determinant of \u03bb\u03bc so that,\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bb \u03bb\u03bd = \u03b4\u03bd\ni\n\ni\n\n\u03bc\n\u03bb \u03bb\u03bc = \u03b4\nj\n\ni\n\ni j\n\n(1)\n\n,\n,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere summation convention is carried out over repeated indices, regardless of their positions. The affine connection \u0393\u03b1\u03bc\u03bd characterizing the space will be defined as a consequence\nof absolute parallelism condition,\n\u03bc\n(3)\n\u03bb+| \u03bd = 0 ,\ni\n\nwhere the (+) sign and the stroke used to characterize this type of tensor differentiation\nusing the affine connection \u0393\u03b1\u03bc\u03bd . For a space of dimension 4 , there are 64 equations (3)\nwith the unique solution,\n(4)\n\u0393\u03b1\u03bc\u03bd = \u03bb\u03b1 \u03bb\u03bc, \u03bd ,\ni\n\ni\n\n2\n\n\fwhere the comma is used for ordinary partial differentiation. The curvature tensor corresponding to this connection,\ndef\n\nM.\u03b1\u03bc\u03bd\u03c3 = \u0393\u03b1. \u03bc\u03c3,\u03bd \u2212 \u0393\u03b1. \u03bc\u03bd,\u03c3 + \u0393\u01eb. \u03bc\u03c3 \u0393\u03b1. \u01eb\u03bd \u2212 \u0393\u01eb. \u03bc\u03bd \u0393\u03b1. \u01eb\u03c3 ,\n\n(5)\n\nvanishes identically, while that corresponding to its dual \u0393\u0303\u03b1\u03bc\u03bd (= \u0393\u03b1\u03bd\u03bc )does not vanish (a\ndetailed geometric study of the curvature tensors in the AP-space has been recently given\n[10]). Tensor differentiation using \u0393\u0303\u03b1\u03bc\u03bd is distinguished by a (-)sign.

It has been constructed in 1977 by Mikhail and Wanas [3]. In general, the\ntheory is a covariant one. Its anti-symmetric section, representing electromagnetism in\nthe weak field regime, is gauge invariant. The underlaying geometry, for this theory, is\na version of the AP geometry. This version is slightly different from that usually used\nin the literature, since it is based on the dual connection and is of the Riemann-Cartan\ntype. The main advantages of this version are clarified in the following lines. Consider\nthe tensor derivative, of an arbitrary covariant vector A\u03bc , using the dual connection,\nA\u03bc\n\n\u2212|\u03bd\n\ndef\n\n= A\u03bc,\u03bd \u2212 A\u03b1 \u0393\u0303\u03b1. \u03bc\u03bd .\n\n(11)\n\nThe commutation formula of this type of differentiation, for an arbitrary covariant vector,\ncan be expressed by the following relation,\nA\u03bc\n\n\u2212|\u03bd\u03c3\n\n\u2212 A\u03bc\n\n\u2212|\u03c3\u03bd\n\n= A\u03b1 M\u0303.\u03b1\u03bc\u03bd\u03c3 \u2212 A \u03bc\n\n\u2212|\u03b1\n\n4\n\n\u039b\u0303\u03b1. \u03bd\u03c3 ,\n\n(12),\n\n\fwhere,\ndef\n\nM\u0303.\u03b1\u03bc\u03bd\u03c3 = \u0393\u0303\u03b1. \u03bc\u03c3,\u03bd \u2212 \u0393\u0303\u03b1. \u03bc\u03bd,\u03c3 + \u0393\u0303\u01eb. \u03bc\u03c3 \u0393\u0303\u03b1. \u01eb\u03bd \u2212 \u0393\u0303\u01eb. \u03bc\u03bd \u0393\u0303\u03b1. \u01eb\u03c3 ,\n\n(13)\n\nis the conventional curvature tensor and \u039b\u0303\u03b1. \u03bd\u03c3 is the torsion tensor corresponding to the\ndual connection. It is worth of mention that both tensors are , simultaneously, non\nvanishing in this version. This is another difference between the present version and the\nAP-version used in the literature. Because of this difference we attribute, to this version\nof geometry, a Riemann-Cartan character. Now if we replace the covariant vector in\nequation (12) by the covariant tetrad vectors, then this equation can be written as:\n\u03bc\n\u2212 \u03bb \u03bc = \u03bb\u03b1 M\u0303.\u03b1\u03bc\u03bd\u03c3 \u2212 \u03bb \u03bc \u039b\u0303\u03b1.\u03bd\u03c3 ,\n\u03bb\u2212|\u03bd\u03c3\n\u2212|\u03c3\u03bd\n\u2212|\u03b1\n\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\n(14)\n\ni\n\nwhich can be written in the alternative form:\n\u03bc\n\u2212 \u03bb \u03bc = \u03bb\u03b1 L\u0303\u03b1. \u03bc\u03bd\u03c3 ,\n\u03bb\u2212|\u03bd\u03c3\n\u2212|\u03c3\u03bd\n\ni\n\ni\n\n(15)\n\ni\n\nwhere L\u0303\u03b1. \u03bc\u03bd\u03c3 is a fourth order tensor defined by:\ndef\n\nL\u0303\u03b1. \u03bc\u03bd\u03c3 = \u03bb\u03b1 (\u03bb \u03bc \u2212 \u03bb \u03bc ).\n\u2212|\u03bd\u03c3\n\u2212|\u03c3\u03bd\ni\n\ni\n\n(16)\n\ni\n\nWe call this tensor the non-conventional curvature tensor. It is a fourth order tensor\ndefined in the present version of the AP-geometry. It is a unique geometric object which\nmeasures the non-commutativity of covariant differentiation, using the dual connection.\nThis tensor, implicitly, contains both conventional curvature and torsion tensors. It represents the second main difference between the present version of AP-geometry and the\nconventional AP-version .\nThe non-conventional curvature (16) has been used to construct the GFT [3]. The\nscalar Lagrangian function of the theory is obtained by double contractions of this tensor.\nUsing a certain variational technique, the authors of the theory obtained the differential\nidentity,\nE \u03bc \u03bc = 0.\n(17)\n. \u03bd|\u2212\n\nConsidering this identity as representing a general conservation law, the field equations\nof the GFT have been written as,\nE\u03bc\u03bd = 0 ,\n(18)\nwhere,\ndef\n\n\u03b3\n\u01eb \u03b1\nE\u03bc\u03bd = g\u03bc\u03bd L \u2212 2L\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 2g\u03bc\u03bd C\u2212|\n\u03b3 \u2212 2C\u03bc C\u03bd \u2212 2g\u03bc\u03b1 C \u039b .\n\nand\n\ndef\n\nL\u03bc\u03bd = \u039b\u03b4.\n\n\u01eb\n\u01eb\u03bc \u039b . \u03b4\u03bd\n\n\u2212 C\u03bc C\u03bd\n\n\u01eb\u03bd\n\n+ 2C \u03bd\n\n+| \u03bc\n\n.\n\n\u2212 2g \u03b3\u03b1 \u039b\n\n\u03b3\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1|+\n\n,\n\n(19)\n\n(20)\n\nThis shows that E\u03bc\u03bd is a non-symmetric second order tensor defined in the AP-space.\nIn the following lines, the results of applications of the GFT are summarized.\n(i) In the limits of weak static fields and slowly moving test particles [11], the theory gives\nrise to both Newton's gravity and Maxwell's electromagnetism. Also, calculations in this\n5\n\n\fframe shows that Lorentz condition, a condition usually used to fix the gauge in the solutions of Maxwell's equations, is not imposed from outside the GFT , but it arises very\nnaturally as a result of the presence of gravity. The natural appearance of this condition\nrepresents a type of interaction between gravity and electromagnetism.\n(ii) Using an AP-structure with spherical symmetry, of the type F0GI representing the\nabsence of electromagnetism, the metric of the Riemannian space associated with the\nsolution, of the GFT field equations, is found to be identical to the Schwarzschild exterior\nmetric [4].\n(iii) In an application [5], using an AP-structure of the type FIGI, the metric of the Riemannian space associated with the solution obtained is found to be similar to ReissnerNordstrom solution with an extra term. This term tends to zero at large enough distances\nfrom the source of the field. In that application, if the constant of integration assigned to\nthe electric charge of the source vanishes, then the metric will reduce to the Schwarzschild\nmetric and the type of the space will be F0GI.\n(iv) In a cosmological application of the GFT [12], using an AP-structure of the type\nF0GIII (representing the absence of electromagnetism and the presence of a strong gravitational field), a unique solution of the field equations has been obtained. This solution\nrepresents a pure geometric world model. It is a non-empty expanding model with a\ndensity parameter = 0.75. The model fixes the value of the curvature constant k = \u22121,\nand is free from particle horizons.\n(v) Another application of a solution of the type FIGI, having spherical symmetry, is carried out [6]. This solution shows a new interaction between gravity and electromagnetism.\nIt shows that, a rotating neutral massive object can produce a global magnetic field. The\ncomparison between the theoretical results obtained and astrophysical observations of the\nmagnetic field of diverse celestial objects shows good qualitative agreement.\n\n4\n\nA New Solution Of The Field Equations\n\nThe geometric structure to be used in the present application is an AP-space having\nspherical symmetry with n=4. The structure of this space has been derived by Robertson\n[8]. The tetrad vector field characterizing this geometric structure is given, in spherical\npolar coordinates, by:\n0\n0\nB sin \u03c6 \uf8f7\nB\ncos\n\u03b8\ncos\n\u03c6\n\u2212\nr\nr sin \u03b8 \uf8f7 ,\nB cos \u03c6 \uf8f7\nB\n\uf8f8\ncos\n\u03b8\nsin\n\u03c6\nr\nr sin \u03b8\nB\n\u2212 r sin \u03b8\n0\n\nA\nDr\n\uf8ec 0 B sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6\n\uf8ec\n(\u03bb\u03bc ) = \uf8ec\n\uf8ed 0 B sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6\ni\n0\nB cos \u03b8\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n(21)\n\nwhere A, B and D are functions of r only. It has been shown [5] that the geometric\nstructure, given by the matrix (21), has the type FIGI (see section 4). This means that\nthis structure is capable of representing a combined gravitational and electromagnetic\nweak field outside a spherically symmetric material distribution.\nFrom (10) we get for (21),\ng00 =\n\nB 2 +D 2 r 2\nA2 B 2\n\n,\n\ng11 =\n\n1\nB2\n\ng22 =\n\n,\n\ng01 =\nr2\nB2\n\n, g33 =\n6\n\n\u2212Dr\nAB 2\nr 2 sin2 \u03b8\nB2\n\n.\n\n\uf8fc\n\uf8fd\n\uf8fe\n\n(22)\n\n\fEvaluating E\u03bc\u03bd in the space (21), and substituting into the field equations (18), we get\nthe following set of differential equations:\nB 2 + D2r2\nD2r2\n[b(r)\n+\nl(r)] = 0 ,\nA2\nB2\n\n(23)\n\nD2r2\nDr\n[B(r) +\nl(r)] = 0 ,\nA\nB2\n\n(24)\n\nB \u2032 2 2 B \u2032 A\u2032\nA\u2032 B \u2032 D 2 r 2\n\u2212\nl(r) = 0 ,\n(25)\n+ ( + )\u22122\nB\nr B\nA\nAB\nB2\nD2r2\nA\u2032\u2032 D \u2032\u2032 4 A\u2032 D \u2032\nA\u2032 2\nD\u2032 2\nA\u2032 D \u2032 A\u2032 B \u2032 B \u2032 D \u2032\n[\u2212l(r) +\n\u2212\n+ ( \u2212 ) \u2212 2( ) \u2212 ( ) + 3(\n\u2212\n+\n)]\nB2\nA\nD\nr A\nD\nA\nD\nAD\nAB\nBD\nA\u2032\nB\u2032\n1 A\u2032 B \u2032\nA\u2032\u2032 B \u2032\u2032\n+\n\u2212 2( )2 \u2212 ( )2 + ( + ) = 0 ,\n(26)\n+\nA\nB\nA\nB\nr A\nB\nwhere,\nB\u2032\n4 B\u2032\nB \u2032\u2032\ndef\nb(r) = 3( )2 \u2212\n\u22122\n,\n(27)\nB\nrB\nB\nB\u2032\n8 B\u2032\nB \u2032\u2032 2 D \u2032\nB \u2032 D\u2032\n3\ndef\nl(r) = 5( )2 \u2212\n\u22122\n+\n\u22122\n+ 2 ,\n(28)\nB\nrB\nB\nrD\nB D\nr\nand the (\u2032 ) represents differentiation with respect to r.

In order\nto attribute some physical meanings to these objects, authors usually use the following\nscheme. They compare the new theory with previous field theories, dealing with the same\ninteraction(s), using certain limiting conditions. For example, the first results supporting the general theory of relativity (GR) have been obtained by comparing the theory\nwith Newton's theory of gravitation, using the conditions of weak static field and slowly\nmoving test particles. As mentioned above, the GFT is an attempt to unify gravity and\nelectromagnetism. It has been compared [11] with both GR and Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism. The results of this comparison have attributed some physical meanings,\nsummarized in Table 2, to certain geometric objects using certain system of units.\nTable 2: Physical Meaning of Geometric Objects.\n\nGeometric Object\n\nPhysical Meaning\n\ng\u03bc\u03bd\n\nGravitational Potential\n\nC\u03bc\n\nGeneralized electromagnetic Potential\n\nF\u03bc\u03bd\n\nElectromagnetic Field Tensor\n\nT\u03bc\u03bd\n\nMaterial-Energy-Stress Tensor\n\nwhere,\ndef\n\nF\u03bc\u03bd = Z\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u03be\u03bc\u03bd ,\ndef\n\nZ\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd + \u03b6\u03bc\u03bd ,\ndef\n\nT\u03bc\u03bd = g\u03bc\u03bd \u039b + \u031f\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd ,\n1\n(\u03c3 \u2212 \u031f).\n2\nIn addition to the scheme mentioned above, a new scheme called Type Analysis has\nbeen suggested [11], in the context of the GFT, to know the capabilities of an AP-structure\nto represent physical fields. This procedure is usually applied before solving the field\ndef\n\n\u039b =\n\n9\n\n\fequations. It is a covariant procedure since it depends on the values of certain tensors. It\ncan be used to, physically, classify AP-structures to be used for applications (cf.

The non- vanishing components of this vector, in the space\ngiven by (21), have been found to have the values [5]:\nC0 =\n\nDr B \u2032 D \u2032 3\n( \u2212\n\u2212 ) ,\nA B\nD\nr\n\n(44)\n\nA\u2032\nB\u2032\n+2\n.\n(45)\nA\nB\nThe electromagnetic field tensor F\u03bc\u03bd is connected to the electromagnetic potential via the\nskew-symmetric part of the field equation of the GFT (18),\nC1 =\n\nF\u03bc\u03bd = C\u03bc,\u03bd \u2212 C\u03bd,\u03bc\n\n(46)\n\n.\n\nFrom (45) and (46) it is clear that C1 will not produce any electromagnetic field, since A\nand B are functions of (r) only. Then the only non- vanishing components of F\u03bc\u03bd , in the\nspace (21), are\nF01 = \u2212F10 = C0,1 .\n(47)\nUsing solution (43) to evaluate (44), we get:\nC0 =\n\n\u03b1\n2r\n\n3\n2\n\n(\n\n1\n(1 +\n\nm 2\n) (1\n2r\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\nm\n)\n2r\n\n4\nm 3) ,\n)\n(1 + 2r\n\n(48)\n\nand for (47) we get:\nF01 = \u2212F10 =\n\n\u03b1\n5\n2\n\n4r (1 +\n\nm 4\n) (1\n2r\n\n\u2212\n\nm 2\n)\n2r\n\n[9 \u2212 37(\n\nm\nm\nm\n) + 35( )2 \u2212 15( )3 ] .\n2r\n2r\n2r\n\n(49)\n\nIt is clear from(48) and (49) that the constant \u03b1 has a direct relation to the charge of the\nsystem. The vanishing of \u03b1 will lead to the vanishing of the electromagnetic field. Also,\nthe vanishing of \u03b1 will change the type of the space from FIGI to F0GI, and this represents\npure gravity , as stated above. It is to be considered that (49) represents, in general, the\nnon-vanishing components of a tensor, in a certain coordinate system. Consequently, this\ntensor will never vanish in any other coordinate system, in the context of the new solution\n(43). This will be discussed later.\n\n5.2\n\nThe Gravitational Potential\n\nThe symmetric tensor g\u03bc\u03bd , defined by (10), has been identified in a previous work [3]\nas the gravitational potential. Using (10) and the solution (43) we get the following\nnon-vanishing components of the gravitational potential:\ng00 =\n\nm 2\n(1\u2212 2r\n)\nm 2\n(1+ 2r\n)\n\ng01 = g10\ng11 = (1 +\n\n+\n=\u2212\n\nm 4\n)\n2r\n2\n\ng33 = g22 sin \u03b8\n\n\u03b12\nm 2\nr(1+ 2r\n)\n\u03b1\n1\n\nr2\n\n(1 +\n\nm\n),\n2r\n\n,\n= g11 r 2 sin \u03b82 .\n11\n\n,\n\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\n\n(50)\n\n\fTo facilitate comparison with general relativity, concerning gravity, we write the indefinite\nmetric of Riemannian space associated with the AP-space(21). This metric is defined in\nterms of the tetrad vectors via the relation:\nds2\n\n\u2217g\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd\n\n=\n\nwhere\n\ndef\n\nP4\n\n=\n\n\u2217 g\u03bc\u03bd\n\ni=1 ei\n\n=\n\nand ei\n\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fd\n\n\u03bb\u03bc \u03bb\u03bd\ni\n\ni\n\n(51)\n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\n\n(1, \u22121, \u22121, \u22121) .\n\nUsing the solution (43), the metric (51) can be written in the form:\nm 2\n)\n2r\nm 2\n)\n2r\n\nm\n\u03b12\n2\u03b1\nm\n2\n)drdt\u2212(1+ )4 (dr 2 +r 2d\u03b82 +r 2 sin \u03b82 d\u03c62 ) .\nm 2 ]dt + 1 (1+\nr(1 + 2r )\n2r\n2r\nr2\n(52)\nIt is of interest to note that the vanishing of \u03b1 will reduce the metric (52) to the\nSchwarzschild metric in its isotropic form. This supports the result obtained in the previous subsection (5.1) that \u03b1 has to be related to the electric charge of the system under\nconsideration.\nds2 = [\n\n6\n\n(1 \u2212\n(1 +\n\n\u2212\n\nGeneral Discussion\n\n(i) It is shown in subsection 5.1 that the vanishing of the constant \u03b1 will give rise to the\nvanishing of the electromagnetic field. Also it is shown in subsection 5.2 that the vanishing\nof \u03b1 reduces the metric of the associated Riemannian space to the Schwarzschild form.\nFurthermore, as mentioned above, the vanishing of \u03b1 will change the type of the space\n(21) from FIGI to F0GI. These three evidences are consistent with our identification\nof \u03b1, that it has to be related to the electric charge of the system. From dimensional\nconsideration, \u03b1 cannot be directly identified as the charge of the system. Previous\nexperience in Einstein-Maxwell's theory and in classical electrodynamics indicates that:\n(a) The geometric charge (the charge measured in relativistic units G=c=1) is measured\nin cm, (b)The electromagnetic field strength and the electromagnetic potential are both\nlinear in the electric charge of the system. In the present treatment it is clear from (50)\n1\nor (52) that \u03b1 has the dimension cm 2 ; while the electromagnetic field (49) and potential\n(48) are both linear in \u03b1 which is consistent with (b). So, to get an agreement between\nthe present results and (a) we should take,\n\u01eb2\n,\n(53)\na\nwhere \u01eb is the geometric charge of the system and a is some constant length to be fixed\nlater.\n(ii) Using the coordinate transformation:\n\u03b12 =\n\nT\n\n= t + \u03c8(r) ,\n1\n\n\u03c8(r) =\nR\n\nR\n\nm 3\n)\n\u03b1r 2 (1+ 2r\ndr\nm 2\nr(1\u2212 2r\n) \u2212\u03b12\n\n= r(1 +\n\nm 2\n)\n2r\n\n12\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\n\n(54)\n\n\fwe can write the metric (52) in the following form:\nds2 = \u03b3dT 2 \u2212\nwhere\n\ndR2\n\u2212 R2 d\u03b82 \u2212 R2 sin \u03b82 d\u03c62\n\u03b3\n2\u03bc\n,\nR\n+ 21 \u03b12\n\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fd\n\n\u03b3 = 1\u2212\n\u03bc = m\n\n= m+\n\n,\n\n(55)\n\n(56)\n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\n\n1 \u01eb2\n.\n2 a\n\nThe metric (55), apparently, has the form of Schwarzschild exterior metric in its standard\nform. This leads to the following interesting physical meaning. The constant \u03bc can be\nidentified as the total mass of the body causing the curvature of the space. This mass\nconstitutes two parts: The first is the mass m which can be identified as the gravitational\nmass of the body, while the second is a contribution of the electric charge of the body to\nits mass. The second part is independent of the sign of the electric charge , as clear from\n(56).\n(iii)Although the metric (55), apparently, has the Schwarzschild standard form , the\nmodel represents a combined electromagnetic-gravitational field. This is supported by:\n(a) The non-vanishing of the electromagnetic field tensor F\u03bc\u03bd in the coordinate system\n(t,r,\u03b8,\u03c6) as given by (49). The electromagnetic field will never vanish in any other coordinate system, as far as one is using solution (43), since it is represented by a tensor;\n(b) The appearance of \u03b12 term in the metric tensor (52), as \u03b1 being connected with the\nelectromagnetic field as shown above.\nThe type of the space used has been found to be FIGI. It is to be considered that the\ntype analysis, by which we know the type of the space, is a procedure independent of the\ncoordinate system used , as it depends completely on tensors of different types. In other\nwords, the type of the space is invariant under general coordinate transformation.\n(iv)Another interesting result could be obtained from (56). It is shown that as\n\u01eb 6= 0 , \u03bc will not vanish. On the other hand, if \u03bc = 0 , m will be negative which\ncannot be accepted. This means that, if the model represents the field of an elementary\nparticle, relations (56) indicate that massless charged particle cannot exist. This result\nis in agreement with experimental known results. On the other hand, (56) allows for the\nexistence of m = 0 particles, for which ,\n1 \u01eb2\n,\n(57)\n2a\ni.e. particles whose masses are totally electromagnetic in origin [15]. If the model\nrepresents an elementary charge ( an electron or a positron), and assuming that M is the\nmass of the electron in gm and Q is its charge in e.s.u. then\n\u03bc=\n\n1\n\nGM\nc2 Q\n\u03bc= 2\n, \u01eb= 2\n,\n(58)\nc\nc\nwhere c is the speed of light, and G is the gravitational constant. Substituting from (58)\ninto (57), we get:\nQ2\n.\n(59)\n2a = 2\nc M\n13\n\n\fSubstituting the numerical values [16] of Q, M and c, we get from (59),\n2a = 2.81794 \u00d7 10\u221213 cm\nthis length coincides with the classical radius of the electron. So, in general 2a can be\nidentified as the radius of a particle whose mass is electromagnetic in origin.\n(v) It may be of interest to interpret (56) using classical electrodynamics. A charged\nparticle of radius 2a and charge Q will have a self potential energy (cf. [17] ):\n\u03be =\n\nQ2\n4a\n\n(in cm gm sec units) ,\n\n\u03be =\n\n\u01eb2\n4a\n\n(in relativistic units) .\n\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fd\n\n(60)\n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\n\nNow, (56) can be interpreted in view of (60) as follows: apart from the factor 2, the\ngravitational mass of any charged particle will be increased by an amount equal to the\nself potential energy of the field produced by the charge. An interpretation similar to\nthe above one has been obtained by Florides [18], by applying Moller's theory on energy\n[19] to the well known Riessner-Nordstrom solution ; and then studying the motion of a\nneutral particle in the field of a central charged body. From the metric point of view,\none of the differences between the present work and that of Florides [19] is that we have\nobtained a solution whose associated Riemannian space has the metric of the Schwarschild\nexterior form, using which we get the result.\n\n7\n\nConclusion\n\nThe constants of integration have been fixed using certain boundary conditions. The\ncomparison with classical known results has given rise to the identification of the constant\nm as the gravitational mass of the body, the constant \u01eb as its geometrical charge, and the\nconstant a as half its radius. The appearance of the two constants m , and \u03b1(= \u01eb1 ) in\na2\nboth electromagnetic and gravitational quantities shows the interaction between the two\nfields.\nThe solution allows for the existence of a charged particle whose total mass is electromagnetic in origin, and independent of the charge sign. On the other hand, the same\nsolution prevents the existence of massless charged particles. In general, the solution\nshows that the mass of any body, with net electric charge, is made of two contributions:\nOne is its gravitational mass and the other is due to its net electric charge.\nFinally, it is of interest to note that the metric of the Riemannian space is not sufficient\nto give a complete indication of the physical content of the field. It is more convenient to\nuse the procedure known as the type analysis in order to get more insight on the physical\nfields that a certain space is capable of representing.\n\n14\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[1] R.Adler, M.Bazin, and M.Schiffer,Introduction to General Relativity\n(McGraw-Hill 1975) 2nd edition, p.486.\n[2] F.I.Cooperstock, and V.De La Cruz, Gen.Relativ.Gravit.9 , 835 (1978).\n[3] F.I.Mikhail, and M.I.Wanas, Proc.R.Soc.London A 356,471 (1977).\n[4] M.I.Wanas, Nuovo Cimento 66B,145 (1981).\n[5] M.I.Wanas, Int.J.Theor.Phys. 24, 639 (1985).\n[6] F.I.Mikhail, M.I.Wanas,and A.M.Eid, Astrophys.
