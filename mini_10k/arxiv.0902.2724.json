However, a quantum nature of an electron is clearly demonstrated by a variation of the conductivity at low temperatures with a small magnetic field perpendicular to the\nsystem plane. Low-field magnetoresistance is caused by\nthe weak localization of electron waves: a particle can\npropagate via different paths, and among them there is a\nnumber of self-crossing paths with loops. An electron can\npass a loop by two trajectories: clockwise and counterclockwise, which leads to a constructive interference resulting in the increase of the probability for the particle\nto return to the initial point. This increase of the return\nprobability means an increase of resistance and decrease\nof the conductivity in comparison to the Drude formula.\nClassically small magnetic field causes an electron to obtain a phase difference equal to the magnetic flux through\nthe loop for propagation clockwise and counterclockwise.\nThus application of a perpendicular magnetic field suppresses the constructive interference and increases the\nconductivity. Due to unusual field dependence this phenomenon is known as anomalous negative magnetoresistance or positive magnetoconductivity [1].\nCrucial effect on the above picture makes a spin-orbit\ninteraction. If it is strong, the electronic waves also interfere after passage the loops in two opposite directions,\nbut this interference is destructive. As a result, the probability of return is smaller than the classical value, so the\nconductivity correction is positive. Perpendicular magnetic field destroys this interference as well but in this\ncase it leads to a decrease of conductivity, i.e. to positive\nmagnetoresistance. Since the situation is totally opposite\n\nto the spinless case the interference effect in the presence\nof spin-orbit interaction is called weak antilocalization.\nIn semiconductor heterostructures the spin-orbit interaction is described by the following Hamiltonian [2]\nH(k) = ~ \u03c3 * \u03a9(k),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere k is the electron wave vector, \u03c3 is the vector of\nPauli matrices, and \u03a9(k) is an odd function of k. The\nspin splitting due to the spin-orbit interaction Eq. (1)\nequals to 2~\u03a9(k).\nTheory of weak-antilocalization induced alternating\nmagnetoresistance has been developed by Pikus et al.\nin the middle of 1990s [3, 4]. It had successfully described weak-antilocalization experiments on available in\nthat time low-mobility heterostructures [5]. However the\nobtained expressions are valid only for weak spin-orbit\ninteraction and very low magnetic fields. The former assumption means that \u03a9\u03c4 \u226a 1, where \u03c4 is the scattering\ntime, p\nand the latter condition reads as lB \u226b l, where\nlB = ~/eB is the magnetic length. This so-called \"diffusive\" regime takes place in fields B \u226a Btr , where\nBtr =\n\n~\n2el2\n\nis the \"transport\" field at which the magnetic length lB\nequals to the mean free path l. In the theory [3, 4] Btr\nis assumed to be infinitely large which is a good approximation for low-mobility samples.\nHowever, starting from the early 2000s, anomalous\nmagnetoresistance measurements are being performed on\nhigh-mobility samples in different laboratories around\nthe world, see e.g. [6, 7, 8, 9]. The motion of the particle on the trajectories relevant for the interference in\nsuch systems is ballistic rather than diffusive. The field\nBtr is small in these structures being less than 1 mT.\nThe characteristic magnetoresistance maximum occurs\nat B > Btr , i.e. out of the range of applicability of the\ntheory existed that time. Moreover the systems started\nto appear having large spin-orbit splitting (1) and long\n\n\f2\nscattering times so the product \u03a9\u03c4 is even larger than\nunity. The question to theory was sharply raised after publication of the paper by Studenikin et al. [7]: it\nhas been demonstrated that both low-field and high-field\nparts of the magnetoresistance curve can be fitted by the\ntheory [3] but with absolutely different sets of fitting parameters. After the paper [7] it became especially clear\nthat a new theory of weak localization is required.\nSuch theory has been recently developed in Refs. [10,\n11]. The obtained expressions for the magnetoconductivity are valid in the whole range of classically weak magnetic fields and for any values of the spin splittings, i.e.\nfor arbitrary values of B/Btr and \u03a9\u03c4 . The theory takes\ninto account low symmetry of [001] grown heterostructures where both bulk and structure inversion asymmetry\ncontributions to \u03a9(k) in Eq. (1) with linear and cubic in\nthe wavevector terms coexist. This theory opened a possibility to describe anomalous magnetoresistance experiments and to extract adequately spin-splitting and kinetic parameters of high-mobility two-dimensional (2D)\nsemiconductor systems.\nIn the magnetic field normal to the heterostructure\nplane only orbital effects are important in the anomalous magnetoresistance while the Zeeman splitting plays\nno role. Another interesting possibility opens up in the\ncase of the magnetic field applied in the plane of the\nheterostructure. In such a case the orbital effect of the\nmagnetic field is relatively unimportant while the Zeeman splitting dramatically affects weak localization. In\nstrong in-plane magnetic fields the Zeeman effect completely overcomes spin-orbit effect and restores the spinorbit-less value of the quantum conductivity correction.\nHowever in the intermediate regime the magnetoresistance is formed as a result of interplay of the Zeeman and\nspin-orbit splittings. The in-plane magnetoresistance is\nnot sufficiently studied at present.\nIn this review we describe the weak-antilocalization\ntheory for high-mobility 2D semiconductor systems and\npresent the expressions for anomalous magnetoconductivity valid in the whole range of classically-weak fields\nand for arbitrary large spin-orbit splitting. We demonstrate that this theory perfectly describes the experimental data on anomalous magnetoresistance of highmobility heterostructures. We also put forward a theory\ndescribing quantum corrections to the conductivity due\nto an interplay of spin-orbit effects and Zeeman effect of\narbitrary strengths caused by an in-plane magnetic field.\n\nII.\n\nTHEORY\n\nThere are two contributions of different nature to the\nspin-orbit interaction Hamiltonian Eq. (1) in 2D semiconductor systems: the Rashba term \u03a9R and the Dresselhaus term \u03a9D . In heterostructures grown along the\ndirection z k [001] both vectors \u03a9R and \u03a9D lie in the\n2D plane. The Rashba term contains only first angular\nharmonics of the wavevector, while the Dresselhaus term\n\ncontains both first and third harmonics. They have the\nfollowing form\n\u03a9(k) = \u03a9(1) (k) + \u03a9(3) (k),\n\n(2)\n\n(1)\n\n\u03a9R (k) = \u03a9R (sin \u03c6, \u2212 cos \u03c6),\n(1)\n\n\u03a9D (k) = \u03a9D (cos \u03c6, \u2212 sin \u03c6),\n(3)\n\n\u03a9D (k) = \u03a9D3 (cos 3\u03c6, sin 3\u03c6),\nwhere \u03c6 is an angle between k and the axis x k [100].\nWe consider low magnetic fields\n\u03c9c \u226a \u03a9, \u03c4 \u22121 \u226a EF /~,\nwhere \u03c9c is the cyclotron frequency, and EF is the Fermi\nenergy, i.e. those fields where the cyclotron motion of\nelectrons in unimportant. The conductivity correction\ndue to weak localization is given by a sum of two terms\n\u03c3(B) = \u03c3a + \u03c3b ,\nwhere \u03c3a and \u03c3b can be interpreted as backscattering and\nnonbackscattering interference corrections to conductivity.

[12]. In a\nmagnetic field B \u226b (\u03a9\u03c4 )2 Btr , the conductivity is independent of \u03a9, and it is also described by the Eqs. (8),\n(9). The reason is that in so strong field the dephasing\nlength due to magnetic field \u223c lB is smaller than one due\nto spin-orbit interaction, l/\u03a9\u03c4 . As a result, the particle\nspins keep safe at characteristic trajectories. The conductivity for any finite \u03a9\u03c4 has the zero-\u03a9 asymptotic.\nFor \u03a9\u03c4 < 1 this dependence is achieved at B . Btr . In\nhigh magnetic field B \u226b Btr , (\u03a9\u03c4 )2 Btr , the conductivity\ncorrection has the high-field asymptotic [12]\nr\nBtr e2\n\u03c3hf (B) = \u22120.25\n.\n(10)\nB ~\nIn Fig. 1 the conductivity correction is plotted for\ndifferent strengths of spin-orbit interaction. The nonmonotonous dependence \u03c3(B) can be qualitatively explained by noting that the spin state of two interfering electrons can be either triplet or singlet [1]. Indeed,\nthe singlet configuration corresponding to the total spin\nS = 0 is unaffected by the spin-orbit interaction while\nthe triplet contribution is suppressed. These spin states\ncontribute to the conductivity correction with opposite\nsigns: singlet contribution is positive while triplet one\nis negative. The small magnetic field suppresses singlet\nterm only, leading to the decrease of the conductivity\nwhile in higher fields both singlet and triplet states are\nsuppressed. Therefore, the magnetoconductivity in high\nfields is positive. As a result the conductivity as a function of the magnetic field is non-monotonic with a minimum at a certain value of the field, Bmin .\nFigure 1 shows that for \u03a9\u03c4 . 1, \u03c3(B) coincides with\nthe zero-\u03a9 dependence for B > Bmin . The asymptotic\n\u03c3hf (B) is reached at B \u2248 100 Btr for all presented values\nof \u03a9\u03c4 . The positions of minima in the curves are shown in\nthe inset. One can see that Bmin almost linearly depends\non the spin splitting at \u03a9\u03c4 > 0.8. Fitting yields the\nfollowing approximate law\nBmin \u2248 (3.9 \u03a9\u03c4 \u2212 2)Btr .\nIn the limit \u03a9\u03c4 \u2192 \u221e one can see a decrease of conductivity in the whole range of magnetic fields.pAt B \u226b Btr ,\nthe correction tends to zero as 0.035 e2 /~ Btr /B.\nB.\n\nInterplay of Rashba and Dresselhaus terms\n\nHere we study the effect of interference of Dresselhaus\nand Rashba spin-orbit interactions on weak localization.\nWe assume that, in the effective field Eq.

In this case the calculations are\nperformed numerically by using Eqs. (3)-(5), see Ref. [11]\nfor details.\nFigure 2 shows the dependence of the weak localization correction to the conductivity on magnetic field assuming that the magnitude of the first harmonics of the\nDresselhaus term is constant, \u03a9D \u03c4 = 1. Different curves\nrefer to different ratios between Rashba and Dresselhaus\ncontributions (\u03a9R /\u03a9D = 0, 0.5, 0.7, 0.85, and 1.0).\nWe begin to analyze the results with the case of \u03a9R =\n\u03a9D . In this limit, energy spectrum splits into two independent paraboloids. Each of them provides the universal contribution to the magnetoresistance, so the total\ncorrection is the same as in the absence of spin-orbit interaction, it is described by Eqs. (8), (9). The effective\nfield \u03a9(k) in this situation points along the fixed axis,\ntherefore spin rotation angle on the closed loop is zero.\nThe absolute value of the quantum correction to the conductivity steadily increases. In high fields (B/Btr \u226b 1),\nthe correction is described by the asymptotic expression (10).\nWith unequal Rashba and Dresselhaus terms, the rotation angle of the spin at closed paths is no longer zero.\nThis yields (i) a smaller magnitude of the correction and\n(ii) an alternative magnetoresistance. Since, for a given\npath, the rotation angle of the spin is larger the larger is\nthe quantity |\u03a92R \u2212 \u03a92D |\u03c4 2 , a decrease in Rashba term (at\na fixed Dresselhaus term) manifests itself as an enhancement of the spin-orbit coupling. In fact, as is evident\nfrom Fig. 2, \"the depth\" of the minimum increases with\ndecreasing ratio \u03a9R /\u03a9D , and the minimum itself shifts\nto higher magnetic fields. These results are in qualitative agreement with the diffusion theory [4]. In contrast\nto Ref.

This situation is relevant to p-type heterostructures and, to a large\nextent, to the case of the equal first harmonics of Dresselhaus contribution and Rashba contribution (\u03a9R = \u03a9D ).\n(3)\n\nComparison with experiment\n\n= 0\n\n0.5\n\nB\n\nConductivity correction (e /\n\n)\n\n5\n\nIf \u03a9D (k) is dominant then the spin splitting is\nisotropic in k-space. Therefore, the operators A and K\nare again separated into blocks of sizes 3 \u00d7 3. The third\nharmonic of Dresselhaus contribution mixes the states\nwith equal values of N + 3m. The corresponding expressions for the quantum correction to the conductivity are\ngiven in Ref. [11].\nFigure 3 shows the dependences of the conductivity\ncorrection on the magnetic field, as calculated for different magnitudes of the third harmonic of Dresselhaus\nterm, with the first harmonic \u03a9(1) (k) equal to zero.\nQualitatively, the form of the dependences is consistent\nwith the results for the spin splitting described by the\nfirst harmonic, Fig. 1, but the range of variation of \u03c3(B)\nis about an order of magnitude larger. In the magnetic\nfields B \u226b max [(\u03a9D3 \u03c4 )2 , 1]Btr , all curves approach the\nsame zero-\u03a9 dependence (10). With increasing \u03a9D3 \u03c4 , the\nminimum of the conductivity shifts to higher fields. The\ndepth of the minimum behaves nonmonotonically: with\nincreasing spin splitting, it increases at small \u03a9D3 \u03c4 and\ndecreases at large \u03a9D3 \u03c4 .\n\nThe theory developed in Refs. [10, 11] has been successfully applied for description of experimental data on\nanomalous magnetoresistance in various high-mobility\nheterostructures. For the first time it has been done in\nthe work by Guzenko et al. [13] where the parameter \u03a9\u03c4\nas well as the temperature dependence of the dephasing time \u03c4\u03c6 have been determined from the fitting of the\nmagnetoconductivity curves. Note that the experimental\ndata were fitted in a temperature range 0.8. . . 4 K by the\nsame parameter \u03a9\u03c4 \u2248 0.5 for magnetic fields B \u2264 8 Btr\nwhile the minimum took place at B \u2248 2 Btr . The extracted spin-orbit splitting \u2248 1 meV is a reasonable value\nfor the Rashba splitting for the studied 2D electrons in\nInGaSb heterostructures. Note that this splitting could\nnot be determined e.g. by beatings in the Shubnikovde Haas oscillations because it has an order of ~/\u03c4 . At\nthe same time the anomalous magnetoconductivity had\na pronounced minimum allowed extraction of the Rashba\nspin splitting.\nLater on the theory has been applied independently in\ndifferent experimental groups allowing characterization\nof electron spin properties in various 2D semiconductor\nheterostructures, see e.g. [14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. In the work\nby Yu et al. [18] the structures with an electric gate were\ninvestigated with allowance for a change of concentration\nand mobility of 2D electrons. The results of this study\nare summarized in Fig. 4. Left panel of Fig. 4 shows the\nconductivity correction as a function of magnetic field\nplotted for different temperatures at a fixed gate voltage.\nAll curves have minima at Bmin \u223c 2Btr and are well reproduced by the theoretical fit according to Eqs. (6), (7).\nAn inset to the left panel shows low-temperature data\nfitted by a diffusion theory, see Ref. [18] for details. It\nis clearly seen that the diffusion theory does not reproduce high-field part of the magnetoconductivity. Right\npanel of Fig. 4 shows conductivity correction as a function of magnetic field measured at different values of a\ngate voltage. In accordance with the inset to the right\npanel the variation of the gate voltage induces variation\nof the carrier concentration and mobility, therefore the\nspin splitting parameters \u03a9\u03c4 is changed along with \u03c4 /\u03c4\u03c6 .\nFigure 4 demonstrates that at high magnetic fields all\ncurves reach the same universal asymptotics.

This effect leads to the dephasing\nsimilarly to the case of perpendicular field [19]. Further\non this orbital or \"microroughness\" effect is neglected.\nThe other possibility for an in-plane magnetic field to\naffect weak localization or antilocalization of electrons is\nthe Zeeman effect. The corresponding term in the electrons Hamiltonian is\nHZ =\n\n~\n\u03c3 * \u2206,\n2\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u2206 = \u011d\u03bcB Bk /~, Bk is the in-plane magnetic field,\n\u03bcB is the Bohr magneton, and \u011d is the in-plane electron\nLand\u00e9-factor tensor. For simplicity we consider here the\nsituation where only isotropic spin splitting is present\n(\u03a9R 6= 0, \u03a9D = 0).\nAn in-plane magnetic field admixes triplet states of interfering electron pair to the singlet one, thus causing\na dephasing of the singlet state [19, 20]. Theory [19]\ndescribes anomalous magnetoresistance in the presence\nof in-plane field [21]. However the expressions obtained\nin Refs. [19, 20] cover only the case of small spin splittings and relatively weak magnetic fields: \u03a9\u03c4 \u226a 1,\n\u2206 (\u03c4 \u03c4\u03c6 )1/2 \u226a 1. Below we present a general theory describing an in-plane magnetoresistance for the arbitrary\nvalues of the spin-orbit and Zeeman splittings.\nThe conductivity corrections in this case are given by\ne2 2\nl\n\u03c3a (Bk ) = \u2212\n2\u03c0~\n\nZ\n\n\u0003\nd2 q \u0002 3\nP (I \u2212 P)\u22121 \u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1 , (12)\n(2\u03c0)2\n\ne2 2\n\u03c3b (Bk ) =\nl\n\u03c0~\n\nZ\n\n\u0003\n\u0002\nd2 q\nQ\u03b4\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd Q\u03bd\u03bc\u03b3\u03b1 P(I \u2212 P)\u22121 \u03b1\u03b3\u03b2\u03b4 .\n(2\u03c0)2\n(13)\n\nHere\nP(q) =\n\nZ\n\nd2 R\n\u00d7\n\nexp (\u2212R/l\u0303)\n(14)\n2\u03c0Rl\nexp [iq * R \u2212 2iS * \u03c9(R) \u2212 2iL * \u2206],\n\nand the operator Q(q) differs by an additional factor\niX/R in the integrand (14). L is the operator of spin difference of interfering particles. Greek subscripts \u03b1 . . . \u03bd =\n\u00b11/2 enumerate spin states of the interfering particles,\nthe summation over repeated subscripts is assumed. It\nis worth noting, that the Zeeman effect in interference\nis determined by difference of spins since Zeeman splitting is an even function of the wavevector, similarly to\nthe effect of longitudinal-transverse splitting of excitonpolaritons [22]. Therefore singlet and triplet contributions are mixed by the in-plane magnetic field. This is a\nmanifestation of Cs point symmetry of the system in the\npresence of both Bk and Rashba spin-orbit interaction.\nIn contrast, for Zeeman splitting due to the field Bz\napplied perpendicularly to the 2D plane the conductivity corrections have the simplified form similar to\nEqs. (6), (7). Singlet and triplet states do not mix in\nthis case because a presence of the Bz component does\nnot break an in-plane isotropy of the energy spectrum.\nFormally this can be seen from Eq.

Provided that \u2206/EF \u226a 1 the difference of\ntheir occupations and relaxation times can be neglected,\nand each paraboloid yields the same universal contribution to the quantum conductivity correction. As a result\nthe latter equals to the spin-orbit-less value given by\n\u03c3(0) = \u2212\n\n\u0010\u03c4 \u0011\ne2\n\u03c6\nln\n.\n2\u03c0 2 ~\n2\u03c4\n\n(15)\n\nSmall spin-orbit interaction leads to the spin relaxation\nand mixing of paraboloids. However, at \u2206\u03c4 \u226b 1 and\n\u2206 \u226b \u03a9 Zeeman effect of the magnetic field quenches spin\nrelaxation completely [23], therefore even in the presence of the spin-orbit interaction the in-plane magnetoconductivity approaches at high magnetic field Bk the\nspin-orbit-less value Eq. (15).\nThe quantum corrections to the conductivity calculated by Eqs. (12) and (13) are shown in Fig. 5. Different curves correspond to the different values of spinorbit splitting. The dependences start from the zero-field\nvalues of conductivity correction at a corresponding spin\nsplitting [10] and, at \u2206\u03c4 \u226b 1, tend to the spin-orbitless value Eq. (15). In small in-plane fields, \u2206\u03c4 \u226a 1,\nthe conductivity correction decreases because the singlet contribution is suppressed due to an admixture of\ntriplet states. This situation is described by the theory\ndeveloped in Refs. [19, 20]. However, in the intermediate area \u2206 \u223c \u03a9 the spectrum of interfering states is\n\nrearranged. It results in non-monotonous dependence of\nthe conductivity correction on the magnetic field. First,\nZeeman splitting supresses the singlet thus decreasing\nthe conductivity. With an increase of \u2206, triplet states\nstart to be supressed as well and the conductivity increases. At very high fields the Zeeman splitting completely overcomes the spin-orbit splitting and restores\nthe spin-less situation thus decreasing the conductivity\nagain. This results in the presence of minimum and maximum in the dependence \u03c3(Bk ) at \u2206 \u223c \u03a9, Fig. 5, absent\nin the theories [19, 20]. It is noteworthy that contrary\nto Refs. [19, 21] the non-monotonous behaviour of the\nconductivity correction takes place in the absence of the\n\"microroughness\" effect, i.e. due to interference of spin\neffects only.\nRecently the diffusion theory has been applied for calculation of a low-field magnetoconductivity of thin quantum wires [24]. The theory developed here allows one to\ndescribe adequately the weak localization effect even in\nballistic structures with dimensions comparable with the\nmean free path.\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nTo summarize, we have presented a theory of quantum conductivity corrections valid for the state-of-theart semiconductor heterostructures. The theory is applicable in the whole range of classically weak magnetic\nfields allowing for both the diffusive and ballistic carrier\npropagation. It takes into account all possible contributions to the spin splitting of electron energy spectrum\nsuch as linear in the wavevector Rashba and Dresselhaus terms and cubic in the wavevector Dresselhaus term.\nWe have demonstrated that in the case of equal Rashba\nand Dresselhaus terms the magnetoconductivity shows\nmonotonic behaviour contrary to the general case of unequal Rashba and Dresselhaus contributions or dominant\ncubic-in wavevector splitting. The theory is shown to be\nin the excellent agreement with the recent experimental\ndata.\nWe have also studied the magnetoconductivity in the\nin-plane field. Although its orbital effects are relatively\nunimportant, the Zeeman effect of the field enters in the\ncompetition with the conduction band spin-orbit splitting. We predict in high-mobility heterostructures an\nalternating magnetoconductivity due to the interplay of\nvarious spin splittings.\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work was financially supported by the RFBR,\n\"Dynasty\" Foundation - ICFPM, and President grant\nfor young russian scientists.\n\n\f8\n\n[1] B.
