JOHNSON\u2021\nCentre for Particle Theory, Department of Mathematical Sciences\nUniversity of Durham, Durham DH1 3LE, England, U.K.\nUsing the AdS/CFT correspondence, we show that the Anti-de Sitter (AdS) rotating\n(Kerr) black holes in five and seven dimensions provide us with examples of non\u2013trivial\nfield theories which are scale, but not conformally invariant. This is demonstrated by our\ncomputation of the actions and the stress\u2013energy tensors of the four and six dimensional\nfield theories residing on the boundary of these Kerr\u2013AdS black holes spacetimes.\n\nIn situations when a non\u2013trivial field theory is exactly scale invariant, it often\nfollows that it is also conformally invariant. This is sometimes regarded as a rule\nof thumb, although it is known to be not generally applicable. Discussion, and\nfew counterexamples may be found in the literature1\u22125 . These counterexamples,\nall in flat spacetime, are not generic. Here, we construct more counterexamples by\nplacing the field theory in curved spacetime M, and exploit the general structure\nof the conformal anomaly. The general form of the anomaly in dimension n (which\nis even, since we only have conformal anomalies in those cases) is given by6 :\nX\nci Ii + \u2207a J a .\n(1)\nTbaa = c0 En +\ni\n\nHere, the c's are constants, En is the Euler density, Ii are terms constructed from\nthe Weyl tensor and its derivatives, and the last term is a collection of total derivative terms. The first type of term is called \"type A\", the next \"type B\", and the last\n\"type D\". We note that non\u2013trivial counterexamples Rcan be generated by consider\u221a\ning a theory with conformal anomaly, which satisfies M dn x \u03b3 Tbaa = 0, preserving\nscale invariance. This can be done by choosing a non\u2013vanishing type A anomaly\nand a vanishing type B anomaly. The type D anomaly always can be removed by\nadding local counterterms. We now need to find a prescription for defining (and\nstudying the properties of) a sensible theory on a spacetime with properties chosen\nto yield the desired anomalies, producing thus our counterexamples.\nIn this work, we show how to do this. We use the tools which were developed\nin the context of the \"AdS/CFT correspondence\"7,8,9 in our analysis. One of these\n\u2217adel@pa.uky.edu\n\u2020 The\n\nspeaker in DPF 2000\n\n\u2021 c.v.johnson@durham.ac.uk\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nAwad and Johnson, Scale Invariance and the AdS/CFT Correspondence\n\ntools is the boundary counterterm method11 which we use to calculate the quasi\nlocal stress\u2013energy tensor of an AdS gravitational solution (see also refs.[14,15]). According to the correspondence, this stress-energy tensor, evaluated on the boundary\nat infinity, is equal to the expectation value of that of a renormalized field theory\n(at strong coupling) in one dimension fewer. The field theory (see refs.[7\u20139] for\ndetails of exactly which field theory, depending upon dimension) is conformal in\nflat spacetime, but in general lives on a spacetime which shares a metric with the\nboundary of the AdS solution. Complete details of our computations of the action\nand stress tensor components may be found in the literature15,16,17 , and we present\nonly a small part of the results here.\nOur examples come from the Kerr\u2013AdS spacetimes in five and seven dimensions\n(with only one of the two rotation parameters, which we shall call a, non\u2013zero18):\nds\n\n2\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\u00132\na sin2 \u03b8\n\u03c12 2\n\u03c12 2\ndt \u2212\nd\u03b8 +\ndr\nd\u03c6 + r2 cos2 \u03b8d\u03c8 2 +\n\u039e\n\u2206\u03b8\n\u2206r\n\u0012\n\u00132\n(r2 + a2 )\n\u2206\u03b8 sin2 \u03b8\nadt\n\u2212\nd\u03c6\n+ r2 cos2 \u03b8d\u03a92n\u22123 ,\n+\n\u03c12\n\u039e\n\n\u2206r\n\u2212 2\n\u03c1\n\n(2)\n\nwhere d\u03a92n\u22123 is the unit metric on S n\u22123 , and\n\u03c12\n\n=\n\nr2 + a2 cos2 (\u03b8) ,\n\n\u039e = 1 \u2212 a2 /l2 ,\n\n\u2206r\n\n=\n\n\u2206\u03b8\n\n=\n\n(r2 + a2 )(1 + r2 /l2 ) \u2212 2M G/r ,\n\n1 \u2212 a2 /l2 cos2 (\u03b8) .\n\n(3)\n\nThe dimension of the gravitational solution is n + 1, while that of the field theory is\nn.

A quick computation shows\nthat this is a total derivative. In fact, Tbaa = \u2212(N 2 /\u03c0 2 )E4 , where E4 is Euler density\nin four dimensions16 , but\ntopology is trivial. The coefficient is precisely the field\nR 4the\n\u221a\n14\ntheory value . Since d x \u2212\u03b3 Tbaa =0, the theory is scale invariant. Note that the\nEuler density is proportional to \u2737R. It therefore appears to be of type D, and\none might imagine15,19 that it can be removed by a local counterterm. However, in\ngeneral it cannot be written in this form, and this is a red herring. Our anomaly\n\n\fAwad and Johnson, Scale Invariance and the AdS/CFT Correspondence\n\n3\n\nis purely of type A, and as such its coefficient cannot be changed by adding local\ncounterterms. Instead, we must accept the presence of the anomaly and give up\nconformal invariance; the rotation parameter a (which simply corresponds to the\ninclusion in the field theory of a chemical potential coupling to angular velocity20 )\nhas broken conformal invariance of the theory, but scale invariance is preserved.\nConsider now the case of Kerr\u2013AdS7 . We computed16,17 the non\u2013vanishing\ncomponents for the stress tensor at large r.
