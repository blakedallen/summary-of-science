First, MHD turbulence is not so\nmessy as it is believed. In fact, the notion of strong non-linear coupling of compressible\nand incompressible motions along MHD cascade is not tenable. Alfven, slow and fast modes\nof MHD turbulence follow their own cascades and exhibit degrees of anisotropy consistent\nwith theoretical expectations. Second, the fast decay of turbulence is not related to the\ncompressibility of fluid. Rates of decay of compressible and incompressible motions are very\nsimilar. Third, the properties of Alfven and slow modes are similar to their counterparts in\nthe incompressible MHD. The properties of fast modes are similar to accoustic turbulence,\nwhich does require more studies. Fourth, the density at low Mach numbers and logarithm of\ndensity at higher Mach numbers exhibit Kolmogorov-type spectrum.\n\n1\n\nWhat is MHD Turbulence?\n\nA fluid of viscosity \u03bd becomes turbulent when the rate of viscous dissipation, which is \u223c \u03bd/L2\nat the energy injection scale L, is much smaller than the energy transfer rate \u223c VL /L, where\nVL is the velocity dispersion at the scale L. The ratio of the two rates is the Reynolds number\nRe = VL L/\u03bd. In general, when Re is larger than 10 \u2212 100 the system becomes turbulent.\nChaotic structures develop gradually as Re increases, and those with Re \u223c 103 are appreciably\nless chaotic than those with Re \u223c 108 . Observed features such as star forming clouds are very\nchaotic for Re > 108 . This makes it difficult to simulate realistic turbulence. The currently\navailable 3D simulations containing 512 grid cells along each side can have Re up to \u223c O(103 )\nand are limited by their grid sizes. Therefore, it is essential to find \"scaling laws\" in order to\nextrapolate numerical calculations (Re \u223c O(103 )) to real astrophysical fluids (Re > 108 ). We\nshow below that even with its limited resolution, numerics is a great tool for testing scaling\nlaws.\nKolmogorov theory provides a scaling law for incompressible non-magnetized hydrodynamic turbulence (Kolmogorov 1941). This law provides a statistical relation between the\nrelative velocity vl of fluid elements and their separation l, namely, vl \u223c l1/3 . An equivalent\ndescription is to express spectrum E(k) as a function of wave number k (\u223c 1/l). The two\ndescriptions are related by kE(k) \u223c vl2 . The famous Kolmogorov spectrum is E(k) \u223c k \u22125/3 .\nThe applications of Kolmogorov theory range from engineering research to meteorology (see\nMonin & Yaglom 1975) but its astrophysical applications are poorly justified and the application of the Kolmogorov theory can lead to erroneous conclusions (see reviews by Lazarian\net al. 2003 and Lazarian & Yan 2003).\n1\n\n\f2\n\nA. Lazarian and A. Beresnyak\n\nLet us consider incompressible MHD turbulence first1 . There have long been understanding that the MHD turbulence is anisotropic (e.g. Shebalin et al. 1983). Substantial progress\nhas been achieved recently by Goldreich & Sridhar (1995; hereafter GS95), who made an ingenious prediction regarding relative motions parallel and perpendicular to magnetic field B for\nincompressible MHD turbulence. An important observation that leads to understanding of\nthe GS95 scaling2 is that magnetic field cannot prevent mixing motions of magnetic field lines\nif the motions are perpendicular to the magnetic field. Those motions will cause, however,\nwaves that will propagate along magnetic field lines. If that is the case, the time scale of the\nwave-like motions along the field, i.e. \u223c lk /V\n\u221aA , (lk is the characteristic size of the perturbation along the magnetic field and VA = B/ 4\u03c0\u03c1 is the local Alfven speed) will be equal to\nthe hydrodynamic time-scale, l\u22a5 /vl , where l\u22a5 is the characteristic size of the perturbation\nperpendicular to the magnetic field. The mixing motions are hydrodynamic-like3 . They obey\n1/3\nKolmogorov scaling, vl \u221d l\u22a5 , because incompressible turbulence is assumed. Combining the\n2/3\n2/3\ntwo relations above we can get the GS95 anisotropy, lk \u221d l\u22a5 (or kk \u221d k\u22a5 in terms of wavenumbers). If we interpret lk as the eddy size in the direction of the local magnetic field. and\nl\u22a5 as that in the perpendicular directions, the relation implies that smaller eddies are more\nelongated. The latter is natural as it the energy in hydrodynamic motions decreases with the\ndecrease of the scale. As the result it gets more and more difficult for feeble hydrodynamic\nmotions to bend magnetic field lines.\nGS95 predictions have been confirmed numerically (Cho & Vishniac 2000; Maron & Goldreich 2001; Cho, Lazarian & Vishniac 2002a, hereafter CLV02a; see also CLV03a); they are\nin good agreement with observed and inferred astrophysical spectra (see CLV03a). What\nhappens in a compressible MHD? Does any part of GS95 model survives? Literature on the\nproperties of compressible MHD is very rich (see reviews by Pouquet 1999; Cho & Lazarian\n2003b and references therein). Higdon (1984) theoretically studied density fluctuations in\nthe interstellar MHD turbulence. Matthaeus & Brown (1988) studied nearly incompressible\nMHD at low Mach number and Zank & Matthaeus (1993) extended it. In an important paper\nMatthaeus et al. (1996) numerically explored anisotropy of compressible MHD turbulence.\nHowever, those papers do not provide universal scalings of the GS95 type.\nThe complexity of the compressible magnetized turbulence with magnetic field made some\nresearchers believe that the phenomenon is too complex to expect any universal scalings for\nmolecular cloud research. Alleged high coupling of compressible and incompressible motions\nis often quoted to justify this point of view (see discussion of this point below).\nIn what follows we discuss the turbulence in the presence of regular magnetic field which\nis comparable to the fluctuating one. \u221a\nTherefore for\u221amost part of our discussion, we shall\ndiscuss results obtained for \u03b4V \u223c \u03b4B/ 4\u03c0\u03c1 \u223c B0 / 4\u03c0\u03c1, where \u03b4B is the r.m.s. strength\nof the random magnetic field. However, we would argue that our choice is not so restrictive\nas it may be seen. Indeed, at the scales where the velocity perturbations are much larger\nthan the Alfven velocity, the dynamical importance of magnetic field is small. Therefore we\nexpect that at those scales turbulent motions are close to hydrodynamic ones. At smaller\nscales where the local turbulent velocity gets smaller than the Alfven speed we believe that\n1 Traditionally there is insufficient interaction between researchers dealing with compressible and incompressible MHD turbulence. This is very unfortunate, as we will show later that there are many similarities\nbetween the properties of incompressible MHD turbulence and those of its compressible counterpart.\n2 Here we provide a more intuitive description, while a GS95 presents a more mathematical one.\n3 Simulations in Cho, Lazarian & Vishniac ((2002a, 2003b) that the mixing motions are hydrodynamic up\nto high order. These motions according to Cho et al. (2003) allow efficient turbulent heat conduction.\n\n\fMHD Turbulence\n\n3\n\nFigure 1: Separation method. We separate Alfven, slow, and fast modes in Fourier space by\nprojecting the velocity Fourier component vk onto bases \u03beA , \u03bes , and \u03bef , respectively. Note\nthat \u03beA = \u2212\u03c6\u0302. Slow basis \u03bes and fast basis \u03bef lie in the plane defined by B0 and k. Slow\nbasis \u03bes lies between \u2212\u03b8\u0302 and k\u0302k . Fast basis \u03bef lies between k\u0302 and k\u0302\u22a5 .\nour picture will be approximately true. We think that the local magnetic field should act as\nB0 , while the small scale perturbations happen in respect to that local field. This reasoning\nis in agreement with calculations in Cho, Lazarian & Vishniac (2003b) and Cho & Lazarian\n(2003a).\n\n2\n\nDoes the Decay of MHD Turbulence Depend on Compressibility?\n\nMany astrophysical problems, e.g. the turbulent support of molecular clouds (see review by\nMcKee 1999), critically depends on the rate of turbulence decay. For a long time magnetic\nfields were thought to be the means of making turbulence less dissipative. Therefore it came\nas a surprise when numerical calculations by Mac Low et al. (1998) and Stone, Ostriker, &\nGammie (1998) indicated that compressible MHD turbulence decays as fast as the hydrodynamic turbulence. This gives rise to a erroneous belief that it is the compressibility that is\nresponsible for the rapid decay of MHD turbulence.\nThis point of view has been challenged in Cho & Lazarian (2002, 2003a, henceforth CL02\nand CL03, respectively). In these papers a technique of separating different MHD modes was\ndeveloped and used (see Fig. 1). This allowed us to follow how the energy was redistributed\nbetween these modes.\nShould the different MHD modes be strongly coupled when the turbulence is strong? A\nnaive answer is \"yes\". Indeed, strong turbulence implies strong field line wondering. This\nmixes up Alfven and fast modes. In addition, one can show through calculations that the\nmagnetic non-linearities result in the drainage of energy from Alfvenic cascade. However, a\nremarkable feature of the GS95 model is that Alfven perturbations cascade to small scales\nover just one wave period, which gets shorter and shorter as we move along the cascade. The\ncompeting effects coupling different modes usually require more time4 . We note that as the\nconsequence of this reasoning we should assume that the properties of the Alfvenic cascade\n(incompressible cascade!) should not strongly depend on the sonic Mach number.\n4 This\n\nreasoning shows that at the energy injection scale when \u03b4B \u223c B0 the coupling between the modes\nis appreciable.\n\n\f4\n\nA. Lazarian and A. Beresnyak\n\nAre the arguments above correct? The generation of compressible motions (i.e. radial\ncomponents in Fourier space) from Alfvenic turbulence is a measure of mode coupling. How\nmuch energy in compressible motions is drained from Alfvenic cascade? According to closure\ncalculations (Bertoglio, Bataille, & Marion 2001; see also Zank & Matthaeus 1993), the\nenergy in compressible modes in hydrodynamic turbulence scales as \u223c Ms2 if Ms < 1. CL03\n2\nconjectured that this relation can be extended to MHD\n\u221a turbulence if, instead of Ms , we use\n2\n2\n2\n\u223c (\u03b4V )A /(a + VA ). (Hereinafter, we define VA \u2261 B0 / 4\u03c0\u03c1, where B0 is the mean magnetic\nfield strength.) However, since the Alfven modes are anisotropic, this formula may require\nan additional factor. The compressible modes are generated inside the so-called GoldreichSridhar cone, which takes up \u223c (\u03b4V )A /VA of the wave vector space. The ratio of compressible\nto Alfvenic energy inside this cone is the ratio given above. If the generated fast modes become\nisotropic (see below), the diffusion or, \"isotropization\" of the fast wave energy in the wave\nvector space increase their energy by a factor of \u223c VA /(\u03b4V )A . This results in\n\u0015\u22121\n\u0014 2\nVA + a2 (\u03b4V )A\n(\u03b4V )2rad\n\u223c\n,\n(\u03b4V )2A\n(\u03b4V )2A VA\n\n(1)\n\nwhere (\u03b4V )2rad and (\u03b4V )2A are energy of compressible and Alfven modes, respectively. Eq. (1)\nsuggests that the drain of energy from Alfvenic modes is marginal along the cascade5 when\nthe amplitudes of perturbations are weak. Results of calculations shown in Fig. 2 support\nthe theoretical predictions.\nWe may summarize this issue in the following way. For the incompressible motions to decay\nfast, there is no requirement of coupling with compressible motions6 . The marginal coupling\nof the compressible and incompressible modes allows us to study these modes separately.\n\n3\n\nWhat are the scalings for velocity and magnetic field?\n\nSome hints about effects of compressibility can be inferred from the GS95 seminal paper.\nMore discussion was presented in Lithwick & Goldreich (2001), which primary deals with\nelectron density fluctuations in the regime of high \u03b2, i.e. (\u03b2 \u2261 Pgas /Pmag \u226b 1). As the\nincompressible regime corresponds to \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e, so it is natural to expect that for \u03b2 \u226b 1\nthe GS95 picture would persist. Lithwick & Goldreich (2001) also speculated that for low \u03b2\nplasmas the GS95 scaling of slow modes may be applicable. A detailed study of compressible\nmode scalings is given in CL02 and CL03.\nOur considerations above about the mode coupling can guide us in the discussion below.\nIndeed, if Alfven cascade evolves on its own, it is natural to assume that slow modes exhibit\nthe GS95 scaling. Indeed, slow modes in gas pressure dominated environment (high \u03b2 plasmas) are similar to the pseudo-Alfven modes in incompressible regime (see GS95; Lithwick &\n5 The\n\nmarginal generation of compressible modes is in agreement with earlier studies by Boldyrev, Nordlund,\n& Padoan (2002) and Porter, Pouquet, & Woodward (2002), where the velocity was decomposed into a\npotential component and a solenoidal component. A recent study by Vestuto, Ostriker & Stone (2003) is also\nconsistent with this conclusion.\n6 The reported (see Mac Low et al. 1998) decay of the total energy of turbulent motions E\n\u22121\ntot follows t\nwhich can be understood if we account for the fact that the energy is being injected at the scale smaller\nthan the scale of the system. Therefore some energy originally diffuses to larger scales through the inverse\ncascade. Our calculations (Cho & Lazarian, unpublished), stimulated by illuminating discussions with Chris\nMcKee, show that if this energy transfer is artificially prevented by injecting the energy on the scale of the\ncomputational box, the scaling of Etot becomes closer to t\u22122 .\n\n\fMHD Turbulence\n\n5\n\nFigure 2: Mode coupling studies. (a)left: Square of the r.m.s. velocity of the compressible\nmodes. We use 1443 grid points. Only Alfven modes are allowed as the initial condition.\n\"Pluses\" are for low \u03b2 cases (0.02 \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264 0.4). \"Diamonds\" are for high \u03b2 cases (1 \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264 20).\n(b)middle: Generation of fast modes. Snapshot is taken at t=0.06 from a simulation (with\n1443 grid points) that started off with Alfven modes only. Initially, \u03b2 (ratio of gas to magnetic\npressure, Pg /Pmag ) = 0.2 and Ms (sonic Mach number) \u223c 1.6. (c)right: Comparison of decay\nrates. Decay of Alfven modes is not much affected by other (slow and fast) modes. We use\n2163 grid points. Initially, \u03b2 = 0.02 and Ms \u223c 4.5 for the solid line and Ms \u223c 7 for the dotted\nline. Note that initial data are, in some sense, identical for the solid and the dotted lines.\nThe sonic Mach number for the solid line is smaller because we removed fast and slow modes\nfrom the initial data before the decay simulation. For the dotted line, we did not remove any\nmodes from the initial data. From CL03.\nGoldreich 2001). The latter modes do follow the GS95 scaling. In magnetic pressure dominated environments or low \u03b2 plasmas, slow modes are density perturbations propagating with\nthe sound speed a parallel to the mean magnetic field. Those perturbations are essentially\nstatic for a \u226a VA . Therefore Alfvenic turbulence is expected to mix density perturbations as\nif they were passive scalar. This also induces the GS95 spectrum.\nThe fast waves in low \u03b2 regime propagate at VA irrespectively of the magnetic field direction. In high \u03b2 regime, the properties of fast modes are similar, but the propagation speed\nis the sound speed a. Thus the mixing motions induced by Alfven waves should marginally\naffect the fast wave cascade. It is expected to be analogous to the acoustic wave cascade and\nhence be isotropic.\nResults of numerical calculations from Cho & Lazarian (CL03, Cho & Lazarian 2004) for\nmagnetically dominated media similar to that in molecular clouds are shown in Fig. 3. They\nsupport theoretical considerations above.\n\n4\n\nWhat is the scaling of fast waves?\n\nAt both low and high \u03b2 fast magnetosonic waves have nearly isotropic dispersion relation,\nwhich makes them similar to simple acousic waves. In fact, the analytical dependence of the\nwave speed on the angle between k and B is the same for the values of \u03b1 = c2S /VA2 = \u03b2(\u03b3/2)\nequal to x or 1/x. So the case of \u03b1 = 1 represents most anisotropy possible. In the so\ncalled wave turbulence approach perturbations of physical quantities are represented as a\ncombination of weakly interacting waves. (Zakharov, 1965; Zakharov, Sagdeev, 1970; Kats,\nKontorovich, 1973)\nIn the leading order three wave processes waves obey conservation laws \u03c9 = \u03c91 + \u03c92 ,\n\n\f6\n\nA. Lazarian and A.

The structure functions are measured in directions perpendicular\nor parallel to the local mean magnetic field in real space. We obtain real-space velocity and\nmagnetic fields by inverse Fourier transform of the projected fields. (c) Spectra of slow modes\nalso follow a Kolmogorov-like power law. (d) Slow mode velocity shows anisotropy similar to\nthe GS95. We obtain contours of equal SF2 directly in real space without going through the\nprojection method, assuming slow mode velocity is nearly parallel to local mean magnetic\nfield in low \u03b2 plasmas.

The form of resonant surfaces that came from solving above equations play\ncrucial role in the nature of wave interactions. For a nondispersive acousic wave \u03c9 = ck and\nthe resonance occurs only when all three k are collinear. It could be shown that despite the\nanisotropy, even for the case of \u03b1 = 1 fast MHD waves can interact only along rays. In this\nsense both sound and fast waves are a special case in the theory of weak or wave turbulence.\nThe decomposition into interacting waves is conducted by the change to normal variables\nai (k), a\u2217i (k), which are the classic versions of creation and annihilation operators, and leaving\nonly quadratic and qubic terms of the power series of the Hamiltonian with respect to a\nThis method could not be questioned until the perturbation amplitudes are small, however,\nusually, wave turbulence approach takes another step of assuming the randomness of phases,\nwhich allows to write the the kinetic equation for the hak a\u2217k i, or the occupation numbers of the\nwaves. The applicability of this approach is seriosly questioned in the case of nondispersive\nwaves and collinear interaction, since waves, travelling in the same direction with the same\nspeed have an infinite time to interact, hence their phases should reveal growing deviation\nfrom randomness. This is clearly demonstrated on the analythically solvable one-dimentional\nBurgers equation. In this case shocks are formed after finite time, even with arbitrarily small\nnonlinearity. Shocks could be described as a collection of waves with specific phases.\nHowever the validity of the kinetic equation approach has been advocated recently in 3D\nin the framework of the generalized kinetic equation, in which waves are slightly damped\n(L'vov, et al. 2000). In the above paper slight defocusing of isotropisation of the distribution\nfunction reported and the damping is estimated from the nonlinear interaction itself.\nThe kinetic equation approach is thought to work much better in the case of dispersive\nwaves, which allow for noncollinear three wave interactions. For example, if \u03c9 = k 1+\u01eb , \u01eb > 0,\ntriangle inequality allows for such interactions, while for \u01eb < 0 it doesn't. It was shown (L'vov,\nFalkovich, 1981) that the above dispersion with \u01eb > 0 lead to focusing, i.e. anisotropic part\nof the distribution increases faster with k than isotropic one. This effect could be understood\nfrom the simple physical picture of the resonantly interacting three waves with k being the\nsum of k1 and k2 and k < k1 + k2 . The angle between k1 and k2 is in most cases larger than\nthe angle between k and k1 or k2 .\nEven in the case of dispersive waves the validity of kinetic equation approach has been\nquestioned (see, e.g. Majda et al. 1997) in 1-dimensional case by numerical simulations. In\nthis case various types of structures that violate the randomness of phase has been proposed\n(Zakharov, et al, 2004)\nSelf-similar solutions for several types of waves were constructed in the kinetic equation\napproach using Zakharov transformations in k space in the collisional integral. (Zakharov,\n1965; Katz, Kontorovich, 1973). For the particular case of the acoustic wave turbulent 1D\nenergy density was predicted to scale like k \u22123/2 .\n\n5\n\nWhat is the scaling of density?\n\nDensity at low Mach numbers follow the GS95 scaling when the driving is incompressible\n(CL03). However, CL03 showed that this scaling substantially changes for high Mach numbers. Fig. 4 shows that at high Mach numbers density fluctuations get isotropic. Moreover,\nour present studies confirm the CL03 finding that the spectrum of density gets substantially\nflatter than the GS95 one (see also Cho & Lazarian 2004). Note, that a model of random\nshocks would produce a spectrum steeper than the GS95 one.\nThe study of the density perturbation scaling properties and statistics regarless of the\n\n\f8\n\nA. Lazarian and A. Beresnyak\n\nperturbation origin (slow or fast modes) in numerical simulations or observations could be a\nmodel-independent test for applicability of the incompressible MHD approach in small scales.\nIndeed, incompressible MHD requires divergent-free motions, and set the density constant\neverywhere. Flatter density spectrum has been reported in both low-beta MHD and purely\nhydrodynamic high Mach simulations.\nIn the highly compressible case we expect significant non-linear perturbations of density,\nbut what the nature of these perturbations? In a compressible isothermal hydrodynamics\nequations are invariant under transformation \u03c1 \u2192 C\u03c1, it is, then, natural to consider log \u03c1\nso that equations have additive symmetry. If we expect the log-density buildup to be a\nrandom process, then a PDF of log-density will be gaussian. It was confirmed in high-Mach\nhydrodynamic 1D simulations. For the arbitrary polytropic equation of state \u03b3 6= 1 the PDF\ndeveloped power-law tails on both sides. (Passot, Vazquez-Semadeni, 1998)\nOur figure 4 confirmes that the flattening of the density spectra 3D simulations is due\nto very high density spikes, normally present in both MHD and purely hydrodynamic data.\nIndeed, both the spectra of log-density and the spectra of density, constrained from above\nby several \u03c10 do not have flattening, but bear good resemblance to the velocity spectra, and\nhave scaling close to Kolmogorov. A simple removal of high density peaks also results in the\nKolmogorov-type spectrum, which confirms the origin of peaks due to high density clupms\nproduced by large scale driving.\nIt should be noted that this result holds true even in the case of relatively highly magnetized fluid, with MA of 0.5. It is natural to suggest then that a random buildup of log-density,\nwhich in magnetized case will be governed by slow mode and be essentially 1-dimensional,\nworks as well in this case, even though MHD equations no longer posess the symmetry of\nlog \u03c1 \u2192 log \u03c1 + C.\nThe result that a highly compressible turbulence leaves the density field perturbed by\n2-3 orders of magnitude, and even higher in small areas might undermine certain models of\nincompressible turbulent transport, that require weak interaction of waves making transport\nnon-local.\n\n6\n\nIs MHD turbulence and Hydro turbulence similar?\n\nNot only Kolmogorov scaling indicate the similarity between the hydro and MHD turbulence.\nStudies of higher order correlations when the motions perpendicular to the local magnetic field\nare considered show high degree of similarity between the magnetized and non-magnetized\nturbulence (CLV02b). This is suggestive that motions perpendicular to local magnetic field\nare essentially hydrodynamic. For some problems, e.g. turbulent heat transport (see Cho et\nal 2003), this entails similar results with and without B.\nNevertheless, the most important difference between hydro and magnetic turbulence is the\nscale-dependent anisotropy of the latter. This peculiar type of anisotropy entails dramatic\nconsequencies for the transport of cosmic rays or acceleration of charged dust (see Yan &\nLazarian 2004 and references therein).\n\n7\n\nSummary\n\n1. MHD turbulence is not a mess. The turbulent cascade consists of Alfven, slow and\nfast modes cascades. Fast modes follow accoustic turbulence cascade, while Alfven and slow\nmodes are similar to their counterparts in incompressible MHD.\n\n\fMHD Turbulence\n\n9\n\n2. Fast decay of MHD turbulence is not due to strong coupling of compressible and\nincompressible motions. The transfer of energy from Alfven to compressible modes is small.\nThe Alfven mode develops on its own and decays fast.\n3. Density fluctuations follow the scaling of Alfvenic part of the cascade only at small\nMach numbers. At large Mach numbers the log-density shows Kolmogorov spectrum.\nAcknowledgmentsWe are grateful to Jungyeon Cho for data and nice discussion.
