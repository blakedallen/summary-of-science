The gauge-invariant Lagrangian relevant to lepton masses reads\n1\n(1)\n\u2212 Lmass = Yl lL HER + Y\u03bd lL H\u0303NR + NRc MR NR + h.c. .\n2\nAfter the spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking, the Dirac mass matrices of\ncharged leptons and neutrinos are given by Ml = Yl v and MD = Y\u03bd v, where\nv = hHi \u2248 174 GeV is the vacuum expectation value of the neutral Higgs field.\nThe effective mass matrix of three light neutrinos arises from the well-known seesaw formula M\u03bd \u2248 \u2212MD MR\u22121 MDT . The lightness of left-handed Majorana neutrinos is therefore attributed to the heaviness of right-handed Majorana neutrinos,\nwhile the phenomenon of flavor mixing is due to the mismatch between the diagonalizations of Ml and M\u03bd . One appealing advantage of the seesaw models is\nthe realization of baryogenesis via leptogenesis: the lepton number asymmetries are\nfirst generated from the CP-violating and out-of-equilibrium decays of heavy Majorana neutrinos and then converted into the baryon number asymmetry by means of\nthe (B \u2212 L)-conserving sphaleron interaction.2 However, a seesaw model is usually\nplagued with too many free parameters even in the basis where the mass matrices\n1\n\n\fJuly 3, 2018 13:51 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\n2\n\nZHOUSH\n\nZhi-zhong Xing and Shun Zhou\n\nof charged leptons and right-handed neutrinos are simultaneously diagonal. Let us\nexplicitly count the number of model parameters. Besides the right-handed Majorana neutrino masses Mi (for i = 1, 2, 3), there remain fifteen free parameters in the\nDirac neutrino mass matrix MD after three unphysical phases are removed by redefining the charged-lepton fields. At low energies, there are only nine observables:\nthree light neutrino masses mi (for i = 1, 2, 3), three neutrino mixing angles \u03b8ij\n(for ij = 12, 23, 13), and three CP-violating phases (\u03b4, \u03c1, \u03c3). Hence a generic seesaw\nmodel cannot make any specific predictions, unless some additional assumptions are\nimposed on it.\nThe minimal type-I seesaw model includes only two heavy right-handed Majorana neutrinos.3,4 In this case, MD is a 3 \u00d7 2 complex matrix which in general\nhas nine physical parameters. Hence there are totally eleven parameters in this\nsimplified seesaw model. In contrast, there are totally eighteen parameters in the\nconventional seesaw model with three right-handed Majorana neutrinos. An intrinsic feature of the minimal type-I seesaw model is that the lightest neutrino must\nbe massless and only one of the Majorana CP-violating phases (\u03c1 or \u03c3) survives. It\nis well known that this is the most economical seesaw scenario that can interpret\nboth the neutrino masses and the cosmological baryon number asymmetry. Alternatively, the introduction of a heavy triplet scalar into the standard model can also\ngive rise to tiny Majorana masses of three known neutrinos.5 From the viewpoint\nof grand unified theories, however, the most natural choice is to introduce both the\nright-handed neutrino singlets and the scalar triplet. It is easy to show that only\none triplet Higgs and one right-handed Majorana neutrino are enough to account\nfor both the neutrino oscillation experiments and the observed matter-antimatter\nasymmetry of the universe. This scenario is usually referred to as the minimal typeII seesaw model.6\nWe now propose an intriguing minimal type-I seesaw model with two nearly degenerate right-handed Majorana neutrinos of O(1 TeV), which may be accessible at\nthe forthcoming Large Hadron Collider. Let us begin with a useful parametrization:7\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n00\nx0\n(1)\n(3)\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\nMD = V0 x 0 U ,\nMD = V0 0 y\uf8f8 U\n(2)\n0y\n00\nfor m1 = 0 and m3 = 0 cases, where V0 and U are 3 \u00d7 3 and 2 \u00d7 2 unitary\nmatrices, respectively. Then the seesaw relation M\u03bd = \u2212MD MR\u22121 MDT implies that\nthe neutrino mixing depends primarily on V0 and the decays of heavy neutrinos rely\nmainly on U . Hence we take V0 to be the tri-bimaximal mixing pattern8\n\u221a\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb \u221a\n1/\u221a3\n0\u221a\n2/ \u221a6\n(3)\nV0 = \uf8ed\u22121/\u221a 6\n1/ \u221a\n3\n1/\u221a2\uf8f8 ,\n1/ 6\n\u2212 1/ 3 1/ 2\nwhich is compatible very well with the best fit of current experimental data.1 On\n\n\fJuly 3, 2018 13:51 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\nZHOUSH\n\nThe Minimal Type-I Seesaw Model and Flavor-dependent Leptogenesis\n\nthe other hand, the unitary matrix U can be parameterized as\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012 \u2212i\u03b1\n\u0013\ncos \u03b8 sin \u03b8\ne\n0\nU =\n.\n\u2212 sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8\n0 e+i\u03b1\n\n3\n\n(4)\n\nSince \u03b1 is the only phase parameter in our model, it should be responsible both for\nthe CP violation in neutrino oscillations and for the CP violation in Ni decays. For\nsimplicity, here we fix \u03b8 = \u03c0/4 and highlight the role of \u03b1 in neutrino mixing and\nleptogenesis. In order to implement the idea of resonant leptogenesis, we suppose\nthat two heavy Majorana neutrino masses are highly degenerate; i.e., the magnitude\nof r \u2261 (M2 \u2212 M1 )/M2 is strongly suppressed.9\nGiven |r| < O(10\u22124 ), the explicit form of M\u03bd can reliably be formulated from the\nseesaw relation M\u03bd = \u2212MD MR\u22121 MDT by neglecting the tiny mass splitting between\nN1 and N2 . In this good approximation, we diagonalize M\u03bd through V \u2020 M\u03bd V \u2217 =\nDiag {m1 , m2 , m3 }, where V is just the neutrino mixing matrix. In the m1 = 0 case,\nthree mixing angles and the Dirac CP-violating phase are determined by\nsin2 \u03b812 =\n\nsin2 \u03b8\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n1 \u2212 sin2 \u03b8\n, \u03b4=\u2212 ,\n, \u03b823 = , sin2 \u03b813 =\n2\n4\n3\n2\n3 \u2212 sin \u03b8\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is given by tan 2\u03b8 = 2\u03c9 tan 2\u03b1/(1 + \u03c9 2 ) with \u03c9 \u2261 x/y \u2208 (0, 1). It is\nstraightforward to derive\nsin2 \u03b812 = (1 \u2212 2 tan2 \u03b813 )/3. Taking account of m2 =\np\np\n2\n2\n\u2206m21 and m3 = \u2206m21 + |\u2206m232 |, we arrive at m2 \u2248 8.9 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV and m3 \u2248\n5.1 \u00d7 10\u22122 eV by using \u2206m221 \u2248 8.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 and |\u2206m232 | \u2248 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2\nas the typical input.1 The values of m2 and m3 , together with \u03b813 < 10\u25e6 , lead to\n0.39 . \u03c9 . 0.42, 0\u25e6 . \u03b1 . 23\u25e6 and 0\u25e6 . \u03b8 . 18\u25e6 . We find that m2 \u2248 x2 /M2 and\nm3 \u2248 y 2 /M2 are good approximations for \u03b1 . 10\u25e6 . For the inverted neutrino mass\nhierarchy (m3 = 0), we have\n\u03c0\n1 + sin2 \u03b8\n,\n\u03b823 = ,\n\u03b813 = 0 ,\n\u03b4=0.\n(6)\n3\n4\np\np\n|\u2206m232 | \u2212 \u2206m221 and m2 = |\u2206m232 |, we get m1 \u2248\nTaking account of m1 =\n4.9 \u00d7 10\u22122 eV and m2 \u2248 5.0 \u00d7 10\u22122 eV by inputting \u2206m221 \u2248 8.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 and\n|\u2206m232 | \u2248 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 . Given 30\u25e6 < \u03b812 < 38\u25e6 ,1 \u03b8 is found to lie in the range\n0 . \u03b8 . 22\u25e6 . Furthermore, the values of m1 and m2 allow us to get 0\u25e6 . \u03b1 . 22\u25e6\nand 0.991 . \u03c9 . 0.992. The neutrino masses reliably approximate to m1 \u2248 x2 /M2\nand m2 \u2248 y 2 /M2 for \u03b1 . 10\u25e6 in this case. From a phenomenological point of view,\nthe scenario with m1 = 0 is more favored and more interesting than the scenario\nwith m3 = 0. Both of them can be tested in the near future.\nWe proceed to calculate the cosmological baryon number asymmetry via the\nflavor-dependent resonant leptogenesis. Note that all the Yukawa interactions of\ncharged leptons are in thermal equilibrium at the TeV scale, so the lepton number\nasymmetry for each flavor should be treated separately due to its distinct thermal\nhistory.10 In the framework of resonant leptogenesis, it is straightforward to compute the CP-violating asymmetry between Ni \u2192 l\u03b1 + H c and Ni \u2192 l\u03b1c + H decays\nsin2 \u03b812 =\n\n\fJuly 3, 2018 13:51 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\n4\n\nZHOUSH\n\nZhi-zhong Xing and Shun Zhou\n\nfor each lepton flavor \u03b1 (= e, \u03bc or \u03c4 ):\nh\nn\n\u0001 io\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2217\n8\u03c0 Mi2 \u2212 Mj2 Im (Y\u03bd )\u03b1j (Y\u03bd )\u03b1i Mi Mi Y\u03bd\u2020 Y\u03bd ji + Mj Y\u03bd\u2020 Y\u03bd ij\n\u0014\n, (7)\n\u03b5i\u03b1 =\n\u0011\n\u00112 \u0015 \u0010\n\u0010\n\u00012\nY\u03bd\u2020 Y\u03bd\n64\u03c0 2 Mi2 \u2212 Mj2 + Mi4 Y\u03bd\u2020 Y\u03bd\njj\n\nii\n\nwhere i and j run over 1 and 2 but i 6= j.

In the strong washout regime\nKi\u03b1 & 1, the survival of lepton number asymmetries is approximately characterized\nby the efficiency factors11\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n2\nK\u03b1 zB (K\u03b1 )\n\u03bai\u03b1 \u2248\n1 \u2212 exp \u2212\n,\n(8)\nK\u03b1 zB (K\u03b1 )\n2\nP\nThe final baryon\nwith zB (K\u03b1 ) \u2243 2 + 4K\u03b10.13 exp (\u22122.5/K\u03b1) and K\u03b1 =\ni\u03b1 . P\ni KP\nf\nnumber asymmetry can be estimated as \u03b7B\n\u2248 \u22120.96 \u00d7 10\u22122 i \u03b1 (\u03b5i\u03b1 \u03bai\u03b1 ). It is\nfound that the observed baryon number asymmetry \u03b7 \u2248 6.1 \u00d7 10\u221210 can indeed be\nachieved.7 For comparison, we also examine the final baryon asymmetry in the oneflavor approximation. Summing the CP-violating asymmetries over all flavors \u03b5i =\nP\nP\n\u03bai \u2248 0.5/ ( i Ki )1.2 ,\n\u03b1 \u03b5i\u03b1 and using the flavor-independent efficiency factors\nP\none gets the final baryon asymmetry \u03b7B \u2248 \u22120.96 \u00d7 10\u22122 i (\u03b5i \u03bai ). In our scenario,\nP\n\u001a\nf\n\u03b7B\n\u22120.71 (m1 = 0) ,\ni,\u03b1 \u03b5i\u03b1 \u03bai\u03b1\n= P\n\u2248\n(9)\n+52.1\n(m3 = 0) .\n\u03b7B\n\u03b5\n\u03ba\ni\ni\ni\nWe see that the flavor-independent prediction for \u03b7B becomes negative in the m1 = 0\ncase, while it is enhanced by a factor \u223c 50 in the m3 = 0 case.\n\nReferences\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n\nA.
