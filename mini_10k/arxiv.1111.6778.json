This includes the properties of highly\ncorrelated states of matter, such as Bose\u2013Einstein condensates (BECs) [1, 2], Mott insulators [3], and supersolids [4]. It also allows access to the phase transitions\nand crossovers between these fascinating phases. In the\nlast few years, the BEC\u2013BCS crossover [5\u20138] between a\nmolecular BEC and a Bardeen\u2013Cooper\u2013Schrieffer (BCS)\npairing state, has stimulated a wealth of experimental\nactivity using fermionic atoms [9\u201316]. This has been\nachieved through the use of Feshbach resonances, which\nenable one to control the strength of pairing interactions\nusing a magnetic field. This has not only opened the\ndoor to central problems in condensed matter physics,\nbut also offers insights into the quantum chemistry of\nmolecule formation and chemical reactions [17].\nIn tandem with these advances, Feshbach resonances\nand molecule formation have also been studied in bosonic\nsystems [18\u201326]. Recent experiments have been performed both in optical traps [27\u201329] and in optical lattices [30]; for a review see Ref. [31]. On the theoretical\nside, the BEC\u2013BCS \"crossover\" problem for bosons has\nalso been investigated in the continuum limit [32\u201334] and\non the lattice [35\u201340]. The problem differs markedly from\nthe fermionic case since the carriers themselves may Bose\ncondense. This leads to the possibility of an Ising quantum phase transition occurring between distinct paired\nsuperfluids [32\u201334]. The phases are distinguished by the\npresence or absence of carrier condensation, and the associated quantum phase transition involves discrete Z2\nsymmetry breaking. Closely related phases and quantum phase transitions have also been observed in multi-\n\ncomponent fermion systems [41\u201344], and in the attractive Bose\u2013Hubbard model with a restricted three particle Hilbert space [45\u201351]. There are also magnetic analogues in quantum spin chains [52]. More recently, the\nphenomenon of boson pairing has also been explored in\nthe context of a generalized classical XY model with two\ncompeting harmonics in the periodic interactions [53\u201356].\nThis has led to the prediction of a novel phase diagram\nwith unusual criticality.\nMotivated by the possibility of stabilizing pairing\nphases of bosons [57\u201362] in cold atomic gases, we recently\ninvestigated the bosonic Feshbach resonance problem in\none dimension (1D) [63]. We employed large scale DMRG\n(Density Matrix Renormalization Group) [64] and field\ntheory techniques [63] in order to incorporate the effects\nof enhanced quantum fluctuations in 1D. Amongst our\nfindings, we presented compelling evidence for an Ising\nquantum phase transition separating distinct superfluids [65]. The aim of the present manuscript is to shed\nfurther light on this novel transition, and to provide a\nthorough discussion of the superfluid phases in this 1D\nsetting. In particular, we describe a variety of methods to extract the Ising characteristics from the gapless\nsuperfluid background. We also provide a quantitative\nfinite-size scaling analysis of the zero-momentum occupation numbers and the visibility. Our results are consistent with the absence of a purely atomic superfluid\nphase with non-condensed molecules, in contrast to the\nearlier suggestions of Ref. [37, 38].\nThe layout of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II\nwe present the Hamiltonian under investigation and in\nSec. III we discuss the phase diagram. In Sec. IV we\ndescribe the associated field theory and gather our predictions for a variety of local expectation values and correlation functions. We use these results to characterize\n\n\f2\nthe different phases and to establish a detailed comparison with DMRG. In Sec. V we provide a quantitative\naccount of the finite-size scaling of the zero-momentum\noccupation numbers and the visibility. We contrast our\nresults with those of Refs. [37, 38]. In Sec. VI we discuss the behavior of the entanglement entropy and the\nemergence of Ising criticality at the transition between\nthe distinct paired superfluids. We also discuss the behavior at the superfluid\u2013Mott insulator transitions. In\nSec. VII we describe the Ising scaling regime, and discuss a variety of ways to extract the principal Ising characteristics. This includes the Ising order parameter and\nthe correlation length using a finite-size scaling analysis\nof the atomic and molecular correlation functions. We\nalso discuss the utility of a suitable ratio of the atomic\nand molecular two-point functions for analyzing the Ising\nquantum phase transition. We conclude in Sec. VIII and\nprovide further directions for research.\n\nII.\n\nMODEL\n\nWe consider the Hamiltonian\n\u0011\nX\nXX \u0010 \u2020\nH=\n\u000f\u03b1 ni\u03b1 \u2212\nt\u03b1 bi\u03b1 bi+1\u03b1 + H.c.\ni\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\ni\n\nX U\u03b1\u03b10\nni\u03b1 (ni\u03b10 \u2212 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b10 ) + HF ,\n+\n2\n0\n\n(1)\n\ni\u03b1\u03b1\n\ndescribing bosons, bi\u03b1 , hopping on a 1D lattice with sites\ni, where \u03b1 = a, m labels atoms and molecules [35\u201340].\nHere, \u000f\u03b1 are on-site potentials, t\u03b1 are nearest neighbor\nhopping parameters, and U\u03b1\u03b10 are interactions. We assume that molecule formation is described by the s-wave\nFeshbach resonance term,\nX \u2020\nHF = g\n(mi ai ai + H.c.),\n(2)\ni\n\nwhere we denote mi \u2261 bim and ai \u2261 bia ; for recent work on the p-wave problem see Refs. [66, 67].\nThis conversion implies that the number of atoms and\nmolecules\nP are not separately conserved, but the total,\nNT \u2261 i (nia + 2nim ), is preserved. For simplicity, in\nwriting Eq. (1) we neglect any effects of higher Bloch\nbands in optical lattices [68\u201370]. In this respect, the\nHamiltonian (1) may be regarded as a lattice regularization of the continuum models studied in Refs. [32\u201334];\nsee also Refs. [24\u201326]. This approach is very convenient\nfor numerical simulations, and enables us to investigate\nthe superfluid transitions where lattice effects are germane. It also allows us to make contact with previous\nquantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations [37, 38] and to\nplace the problem on a firmer footing. As in the original\nworks [32\u201334], we neglect the effects of three body losses\nand finite molecular lifetimes.\nIn this manuscript we use DMRG on 1D systems with\nup to L = 512 sites, where we set the lattice spacing to\n\nunity and adopt energy units where ta = 1. We furthermore set tm = 1/2 throughout. We work in the canonical ensemble with the total density \u03c1T = NT /L = 2\nheld fixed and allow up to five atoms and five molecules\nper site, corresponding to a large Hilbert space of dimension (6 \u00d7 6)L ; for a discussion of the effects of changing the local Hilbert space dimension see Appendix A.\nWith open (periodic) boundary conditions we retain up\nto m\u03c1 = 2400 (m\u03c1 = 3000) states in the density matrix\nin order to ensure that the discarded weight is less than\n1 \u00d7 10\u221210 (1 \u00d7 10\u22128 ).\nIII.\n\nPHASE DIAGRAM\n\nAs we discussed in Ref. [63], the qualitative phase diagram of the 1D lattice Hamiltonian (1) was previously\nconsidered using QMC simulations [37, 38]. In addition\nto delineating the Mott insulating and superfluid phase\nboundaries, this work led to intriguing predictions of superfluidity within the Mott phase, and an additional superfluid phase not present in mean field theory [32\u201336].\nAlthough we find very good quantitative agreement with\nmany of the numerical results [37, 38], these additional\npredictions are at variance with our recent findings [63]\nwhich combine field theory with DMRG. This was also\nsuggested by our earlier studies using hardcore bosons\n[39, 40]. It has recently been argued that the absence\nof particle conservation hindered the interpretation of\nthese previous QMC simulations [71]. In this manuscript\nwe will further demonstrate that the use of momentum\nspace observables, including the zero-momentum occupation numbers and the visibility, also complicated the interpretation of these earlier finite-size QMC simulations.\nIn order to put the problem on a more stable platform,\nwe present a section of the phase diagram in Fig. 1, with\nparameters chosen for comparison with Ref. [37]. (Note\nthat our conventions differ from Ref. [37] by a factor of\n1/2 in the interaction terms so that double occupancy\ncorresponds directly to U\u03b1\u03b10 . Also, \u000fm plays the role of\ntheir detuning parameter, D, when \u000fa = 0.) The phase\nboundaries shown in Fig. 1 correspond to the vanishing of\nthe one-particle and two-particle excitation gaps, E1g \u2261\n\u03bc1p (L) \u2212 \u03bc1h (L) and E2g \u2261 \u03bc2p (L) \u2212 \u03bc2h (L) respectively,\nwhere the data are extrapolated to the thermodynamic\nlimit, L \u2192 \u221e. Here\n\u03bcnp (L) = [E0 (L, NT + n) \u2212 E0 (L, NT )] /n,\n\u03bcnh (L) = [E0 (L, NT ) \u2212 E0 (L, NT \u2212 n)] /n,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere E0 (L, N ) is the ground state energy for a system\nof size L and a total number N of atoms and molecules.\nThe phase diagram in Fig. 1 consists of three distinct\nphases: a Mott insulator (MI) with gaps for both excitations, E1g 6= 0 and E2g 6= 0, a molecular condensate\n(MC) with a one-particle gap E1g 6= 0 and E2g = 0, and\na coupled atomic plus molecular condensate (AC+MC)\nwith E1g = 0 and E2g = 0. As we shall discuss more\n\n\f3\n\n3\n\nthe additional claims of superfluidity within the Mott\nphase [39, 71]. Here, however, our main focus is on the\ncharacter of the transition between the distinct MC and\nAC+MC superfluids. In the subsequent discussion we\nwill begin with symmetry arguments and field theory predictions before turning to a comparison with DMRG.\n\n(a)\n,\n\nMC\nZ2 Disordered\n\n2\n\n(c)\n\nAC+MC\n\n1/U\n\nE1g 6= 0, E2g = 0\n\nZ2 Ordered\n\n(b)\n\nE1g = 0, E2g = 0\n\n1\n\nIV.\n\nMI\nE1g 6= 0, E2g 6= 0\n\n0\n-10\n\n-8\n\n-4\n\n-6\n\n0.4\n\nE1g , E2g\n\n(b)\n\n\u01ebm\n\n-2\n\n(c)\n\n0\n0.4\n\n2\n\n4\n(d)\n\n3 0.1\n0.2\n0.2\n\nE1g\nE2g\n\n0\n\n0.8\n1.2\n1/U\n\nFIELD THEORY DESCRIPTION\n\n(d)\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-3.76 -3.72\n\n\u01ebm\n\n0\n\nA heuristic way to understand the possibility of an\nIsing quantum phase transition between the distinct MC\nand AC+MC superfluids is via the generic number-phase\n\u221a\n\u221a\nrelationships, a \u223c \u03c1a ei\u03b8a and m \u223c \u03c1m ei\u03b8m , where \u03c1a\nand \u03c1m are the average atomic and molecular densities\nrespectively. Substituting these expressions into (1), the\nFeshbach term (2) takes the form [34]\n\u221a\nHF \u223c 2g\u03c1a \u03c1m cos(\u03b8m \u2212 2\u03b8a ).\n\n0.22 0.24 0.26\n1/U\n\nFIG. 1.

(a) Phase diagram of the 1D Hamiltonian (1) with total density \u03c1T = NT /L = 2, showing a Mott\ninsulator (MI), a molecular condensate (MC), and a coupled\natomic plus molecular condensate (AC+MC). We use DMRG\nwith up to L = 128 sites and open boundary conditions. We\nchoose parameters \u000fa = 0, Uaa /2 = Umm /2 = Uam = g = U ,\nta = 1, tm = 1/2, for comparison with Ref. [37]. The squares\nand circles indicate the vanishing of the one-particle and twoparticle gaps, E1g and E2g , respectively, as L \u2192 \u221e. The stars\nand crosses indicate where the molecular and atomic correlation exponents, \u03bdm and \u03bda reach 1/4 in the MC and AC+MC\nphases respectively. These values correspond to a molecular\nKT transition and an atomic KT transition respectively. The\nremaining panels (b), (c) and (d) show the variation of the\nextrapolated gaps, E1g and E2g with L \u2192 \u221e, on passing\nthrough the phase boundaries at the corresponding points in\npanel (a). In particular, we provide detailed evidence for an\nIsing quantum phase transition occurring between the MC\nand AC+MC phases.\n\nfully below, the MC phase may be interpreted as a pairing phase of bosons in the absence of atomic condensation. In contrast, the AC+MC phase has both molecular and atomic condensation. In comparison to the\nqualitative phase diagram presented in Ref. [37], inferred\nfrom quantum Monte Carlo simulations on smaller system sizes, we find no evidence for a single-component\natomic superfluid phase co-existing with non-condensed\nmolecules. This is in accord with theoretical expectations in higher dimensions, where atomic condensation\nis always accompanied by molecular condensation [32\u2013\n34] provided the molecules are present; in the extreme\nlimit where \u000fm \u2192 \u221e, occurring on the boundary of the\nAC+MC phase, the molecules are explicitly excluded by\nthe chemical potential as shown in Fig. 2. The conclusions of Ref. [37] have also come under scrutiny due to\n\n(4)\n\nMinimizing this interaction locks the phases of the atomic\nand molecular condensates according to the relationship\n\u03b8m \u2212 2\u03b8a = \u00b1\u03c0,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere for simplicity we assume g > 0. We see that the\nphases are locked, but only modulo \u03c0, and this gives\nrise to the possibility of a discrete symmetry breaking Z2\ntransition between Feshbach coupled superfluids. Denoting \u03b8m \u2261 \u03b8, one may recast the number-phase relationships in the form [34]\nm\u223c\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03c1m ei\u03b8 ,\n\na \u223c \u03c6 ei\u03b8/2 ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the Feshbach locking is explicitly enforced and\n\u221a\n\u03c6 \u223c \u03c1a e\u2213i\u03c0/2 plays the role of an Ising degree of freedom. The decomposition (6) will play a central role in\nthe subsequent analysis and allows one to gain a handle\non the correlation functions and the principal features of\nthe phase diagram.\nAn alternative way to understand the possibility of\nan Ising quantum phase transition between the MC and\nAC+MC phases is via the symmetry of the Hamiltonian\n(1) under U(1) \u00d7 Z2 transformations:\nm \u2192 ei\u03b8 m,\n\na \u2192 ei(\u03b8/2\u00b1\u03c0) a,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03b8 \u2208 R. Before discussing the problem in 1D, where\ncontinuous symmetry breaking is absent, we first consider the behavior in higher dimensions [32\u201334]. In this\ncase, the molecular condensate (MC) phase has hmi 6= 0\nand hai = 0. This only breaks the U(1) symmetry,\nand leaves the Z2 symmetry, a \u2192 \u2212a, unbroken. This\ncorresponds to an Ising degree of freedom in the disordered phase, coexisting with molecular superfluidity. In\ncontrast, the coupled atomic plus molecular condensate\n(AC+MC) phase has hmi 6= 0 and hai 6= 0. This breaks\nthe U(1) \u00d7 Z2 symmetry completely and corresponds to\na Z2 ordered Ising degree of freedom, coexisting with\n\n\f4\n\n2\n\natomic and molecular superfluidity. Returning to the\npresent 1D problem, where continuous U(1) symmetry\nbreaking is prohibited, the formation of expectation values for hai and hmi is excluded. Instead, superfluidity is\ncharacterized by power-law correlations, and the nature\nof the phases and quantum phase transitions in Fig. 1\nrequires further examination.\nDue to the U(1) \u00d7 Z2 symmetry of the Hamiltonian\n(1), the low energy Lagrangian of the MC to AC+MC\ntransition is given by L = L\u03b8 + L\u03c6 + L\u03b8\u03c6 [34, 72], where\n\nis a free bosonic field and\ni\nK\u03c6 h \u22122\nc\u03c6 (\u2202\u03c4 \u03c6)2 + (\u2202x \u03c6)2 \u2212 M\u03c62 + \u03bb\u03c64\nL\u03c6 =\n2\n\n\u2020\n\nhmi mii\n\u2020\n\nhmi ai aii\n\nMC\n\n0\n\nAC+MC\n\n-0.5\nU = 0.7\n-1\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n\u01ebm\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n(b)\n\n(9)\n\nAn immediate consequence of the decomposition (6) is\nthat the densities of atoms and molecules\nha\u2020 (x)a(x)i \u223c h\u03c62 i,\n\n\u2020\n\nhai aii\n\n1\n\nLocal Expectation Values\n\nhm\u2020 (x)m(x)i \u223c \u03c1m ,\n\n0.5\n\n(8)\n\nis an Ising model in the soft-spin \u03c64 representation. The\ncoupling between the two sectors, L\u03b8\u03c6 = i\u03c62 \u2202\u03c4 \u03b8/2, has a\nform similar to a Berry phase [34, 72]. A closely related\naction also arises for tunnelling between quantum wires\n[73]. In the following we will neglect the contribution L\u03b8\u03c6\nand explore the consequences of the reduced action. Sufficiently far away from the transition this can be justified\nby a mean-field decoupling, L\u03b8\u03c6 \u223c ih\u03c6i2 \u2202\u03c4 \u03b8/2, which\nreduces the additional interaction to a total derivative\nterm, which can be neglected. The simplified action is\ntherefore expected to provide a good description of the\nproximate phases. Near the quantum phase transitions,\nthis cannot be neglected a priori, and L\u03b8\u03c6 may change\nthe behavior on very large length scales and in other regions of the phase diagram [73]. However, all of our findings are consistent with expectations based on L\u03b8 + L\u03c6\nonly. The parameters K\u03b8 , c\u03b8 , K\u03c6 , c\u03c6 , \u03b7, \u03bb, are related\nto the coefficients of the Hamiltonian (1), but the details\nneed not concern us here. In this field theory approach,\nthe atoms and molecules are described by the semiclassical number-phase relations given in Eq. (6). In the\nsubsequent discussion we will explore the ramifications\nof this correspondence in 1D, both for local observables\nand correlation functions. For complementary work using\nthe Bethe Ansatz and bosonization see also Refs. [74, 75].\nA.\n\n(a)\n\n1\n\n(10)\n\nare generically non-zero in both the MC and AC+MC\nphases.

We plot the local density of atoms ha\u2020i ai i\n(circles), molecules hm\u2020i mi i (squares), and the expectation\nvalue of the Feshbach conversion term hm\u2020i ai ai i (triangles),\nevaluated at the system mid-point, i = L/2. All of these\nquantities are generically non-zero on both sides of the MC\nto AC+MC transition as indicated by the dashed line. In\nthe limit of large positive (negative) detuning \u000fm we have\nmainly atoms (molecules) with a density determined by the\ncanonical ensemble constraint \u03c1T = 2.

These limiting densities are consistent\nwith working in the canonical ensemble\nP\nwith \u03c1T = i (nia + 2nim )/L = 2 held fixed.\nIn addition to these local densities the local expectation value of the Feshbach conversion term,\n\u221a\nhm\u2020 (x)a(x)a(x)i \u223c \u03c1m h\u03c62 i =\n6 0,\n(11)\nis non-zero. It exhibits true long range order, even in\nthis low-dimensional setting. This is a consequence of\nthe relevance of the Feshbach term in the renormalization\ngroup sense. Our numerical results in Fig. 2 show that\nthis quantity is indeed finite. In particular, this confirms\nthe locking of the phases of the atomic and molecular\n\n\f5\ncondensates (modulo \u03c0) on both sides of the transition.\nHowever, due to the symmetry under a \u2192 \u2212a, the expectation value (11) is naively insensitive to the Ising transition itself, as may be seen in Fig. 2. Further insight into\nthis quantum phase transition and the proximate phases\nis more readily obtained from correlation functions. We\nwill explore this in more detail below.\nB.\n\nGreen's Functions and Pairing Correlations\n\nThe nature of the MC and AC+MC phases shows up\nmost clearly in the atomic and molecular Green's functions, ha\u2020 (x)a(0)i and hm\u2020 (x)m(0)i, and the pairing correlations ha\u2020 (x)a\u2020 (x)a(0)a(0)i. Their spatial dependence\nis dictated by the correlations of the underlying Ising\nmodel in Eq. (9), and we address each phase in turn.\n\n\u2020\n\n(a) hai aji\n-8\n\n1\u00d710\n\n-16\n\n1\u00d710 0\n1\n\n100\n\n50\n\n150\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n\n1.\n\n\u2020\n\nZ2 Disordered MC Phase\n\n(b) hmi mji\n\nAs follows from the decomposition (6), the molecular\nGreen's function\n\u0010 a \u0011\u03bdm\n0\nhm\u2020 (x)m(0)i \u221d he\u2212i\u03b8(x) ei\u03b8(0) i \u223c\n,\n(12)\nx\ndecays as a power-law, where the correlation exponent,\n\u03bdm = 1/(2\u03c0K\u03b8 ) varies throughout the phase diagram,\nand a0 is a short-distance cutoff.

That\nis to say, the MC phase is a pairing phase of bosons without power-law atomic condensation [57\u201362].\nIn order to explore these field theory predictions in\nmore detail we perform DMRG on the 1D Hamiltonian\n(1). The predicted behavior is well supported by our\nsimulations in Fig. 3. The molecules and atomic bilinears show power-law behavior with the same exponent,\n\u03bdm = \u03bdb , whilst the atomic two-point function shows exponential decay.

In (c),\n(d) and (e) we show the resulting evolution of \u03bdm (circles)\nand \u03bdb (stars), for vertical scans through Fig. 1 with fixed\nvalues of \u000fm . The vertical dashed lines correspond to the location of the MC to MI transition obtained from the gap data.\nThe molecular exponent reaches the value of \u03bdm = 1/4 at the\nMC to MI transition. This corresponds to a molecular KT\ntransition and is analogous to the fixed density transition at\nthe tips of the Mott lobes in the single-band Bose\u2013Hubbard\nmodel. The critical exponent \u03bdb associated with the powerlaw decay of the atomic bilinears ha\u2020i a\u2020i aj aj i (stars) coincides\nwith \u03bdm .\n\ncanonical ensemble constraint, \u03c1T = 2.\nWe recall that in deriving the above correlation functions we have neglected the coupling term, L\u03b8\u03c6 in the\nlow-energy Lagrangian so that the expressions factorize\ninto independent U(1) and Z2 contributions. The good\nagreement with DMRG lends a postiori support to this\napproximation within the explored region of the phase\ndiagram.\n\nand K0 (z) and K1 (z) are Bessel functions. These predictions of power-law behavior, as given by Eqs. (15)\nand (16), are well supported by our numerical simulations as shown in Fig. 5. The locking of the atomic and\nmolecular correlation exponents \u03bda = \u03bdm /4 is also observed. In addition, these robust features persist into\nthe large-U regime where field theory arguments are no\nlonger strictly valid. In particular, the atomic and molecular correlation functions remain as power-laws right up\nto the MI boundary shown in Fig. 1. We find that the\natomic exponent \u03bda reaches the value of \u03bda = 1/4 at the\nAC+MC to MI transition; see Fig. 6. This is consistent\nwith an atomic KT transition, as occurs at the tips of\nthe Mott lobes in the single-band Bose\u2013Hubbard model.\nAt the same time, the molecular exponent \u03bdm reaches\nthe value of \u03bdm = 1 due to the aforementioned exponent\nlocking; see Fig. 6. The presence of this molecular superfluid close to the MI boundary, clearly supports the\nabsence of a single component atomic superfluid phase in\nthis 1D setting, in contrast to the findings of Ref. [37].\nThis is also compatible with mean field theory in higher\ndimensions [32\u201334] where atomic condensation is always\naccompanied by molecular condensation due to the structure of the Feshbach term, HF . We will return to this\nissue in Sec.

In particular, since\nthe molecular exponent, \u03bdm , only reaches unity at the\nMott phase boundary (see Figs. 1 and 6) both of these\nzero-momentum occupation numbers are expected to diverge with increasing system size. This is supported by\nour DMRG results as shown in Fig. 10. However, it is evident from Eq. (23) that nm (0) diverges very slowly with\nincreasing system size close to the MI boundary since\n\u03bdm \u2192 1. In the absence of a detailed finite-size scaling analysis this may lead to the erroneous conclusion\nof a purely atomic superfluid. In addition, our findings\nsuggest the absence of any change in behavior in the con-\n\nvergence properties of nm (0) as L \u2192 \u221e, which could be\nmisinterpreted as a quantum phase transition to a purely\natomic superfluid. In general, in this 1D setting, the zeromomentum occupation number is a poor diagnostic of superfluid transitions, since it may simply reflect a change\nin the value of the critical exponent within a superfluid\nphase, rather than the onset of exponential correlations.\nDirect evaluation of the correlation functions ha\u2020 (x)a(0)i\nand hm\u2020 (x)m(0)i provides a clearer picture in 1D, especially in the case of a finite size system. Our results are\nfully consistent with the absence of a purely atomic superfluid phase in this region of the phase diagram. This\nis compatible with the predictions of mean field theory\nin higher dimensions [32\u201334].\nIn addition to the zero-momentum occupation numbers, the authors of Ref. [37] also consider the visibility.

This confirms the applicability of\nthe conformal result (26) within the AC+MC phase. This\ncorresponds to power-law atomic correlations for separations\nr & 3a0 . The remaining panels show the corresponding results for molecules.\n\nL \u2192 \u221e. In Ref. [37] it was argued that the molecular visibility within the AC+MC phase failed to saturate\nat this value close to the MI boundary. In order to gain\na quantitative handle on this issue we need to exploit\nthe finite-size dependence of the superfluid correlations\nwithin the AC+MC phase. In a system with periodic\nboundary conditions the two-point function of a primary\nfield O(r) at position r can be obtained by conformal\ntransformation [86]:\n\u0014\n\u0015a\n\u03c0\nhO(r1 )O(r2 )iL = N\n,\n(26)\nL sin( \u03c0r\nL )\nwhere a is the critical exponent in the thermodynamic\nlimit, r = |r1 \u2212 r2 | is the separation, and N is a constant pre-factor. It follows that the rescaled combination\nLa hO(r1 )O(r2 )iL is a prescribed scaling function of the\nreduced separation r/L. The confirmation of this behavior for the atomic and molecular correlation functions\nwithin the AC+MC phase is shown in Fig. 11. Given\nthis agreement we may substitute the conformal result\n(26) into Eq. (22) in order to obtain formal expressions\nfor the finite-size dependence of the atomic and molecular visibilities in Eq. (24). In Fig. 12 we show the results\nof this conformal extrapolation, where we further incorporate the exact DMRG results for the short distance\nbehavior with r \u2264 3a0 , where a0 is the lattice spacing.

The crosses\nand stars correspond to Fourier transformation of the conformal result (26) supplemented by exact DMRG results for\nthe correlators at small separations r \u2264 3a0 . The solid line\nindicates the results of conformal extrapolation (described in\nthe text and justified by the scaling collapse in Fig. 11) supplemented by the exact DMRG results for small separations\nr \u2264 3a0 . (a) With \u000fm = \u22122 and U = 1.5 both Va and Vm\nextrapolate to unity in the thermodynamic limit. (b) Close\nto the MI transition with \u000fm = \u22122 and U = 2.2 both Va and\nVm approach unity as L \u2192 \u221e. This is in direct contrast to\nnaive polynomial extrapolation (dashed) which erroneously\nsuggests that the molecular visibility is less than unity.\n\nis readily seen from the solid lines in Fig. 12 that both\nthe atomic and molecular visibilities extrapolate to unity\nin the thermodynamic limit. In particular, close to the\nMI boundary there are strong deviations from the results\nthat would be obtained by naive polynomial extrapolation as indicated by the dashed lines. In Fig. 13(a)\nwe use the conformal extrapolation procedure to track\nthe atomic and molecular visibilities within the AC+MC\nphase. The results are consistent with unity right up to\nthe MI boundary. For comparison, in Fig. 13(b) we show\nthe results that would be inferred using a naive polynomial extrapolation. The results are in accordance with\nthose of Ref. [37], but differ markedly from the asymptotic visibilities obtained by conformal extrapolation as\nshown in Fig. 13(a).\nTo summarize the results of this section, within the\nAC+MC phase the finite-size dependence of the atomic\nand molecular momentum space diagnostics is in complete agreement with power-law correlations for both the\natoms and the molecules. This behavior persists right up\nto the MI boundary and provides further evidence for the\nabsence of a purely AC phase. This is analogous to expectations in higher dimensions arising from mean-field\ntheory analyses [32\u201334].\n\n\f11\n\nVa , Vm\n\n0.9\n\nAC+MC\n\nMI\n\n3\n\n(a) MC (\u01ebm=\u22123.5)\n\nc\u22481\n\nSL(l)\n\nVa\nVm\n\n1\n\n2\n(a) conformal extrapolation\n\n0.8\n(b) QPT\n\nc \u2248 3/2\n\n3\n\nVa , Vm\n\nSL(l)\n\n1\n0.9\n\n2\n(b) polynomial extrapolation\n\n1.5\n\n2\nU\n\n2.5\n\nFIG. 13.

Both\nVa and Vm are unity right up to the MI boundary, indicating\nthe presence of both atomic and molecular superfluidity. (b)\nNaive polynomial extrapolation erroneously suggests that the\nmolecular visibility is less than unity in the AC+MC phase.\n\nVI.\n\nENTANGLEMENT ENTROPY\n\nHaving established good agreement between field theory and DMRG for the MC and AC+MC phases, let\nus now examine the quantum phase transition between\nthem. A key diagnostic in this 1D setting is the central\ncharge, c, which is a measure of the number of critical\ndegrees of freedom. This may be obtained from the entanglement entropy. For a block of length l in a periodic\nsystem of length L, the von Neumann entropy is given\nby SL (l) = \u2212Trl (\u03c1l ln \u03c1l ), where \u03c1l = TrL\u2212l (\u03c1) is the\nreduced density matrix. One obtains [87, 88]\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u0013\u0015\nc\nL\n\u03c0l\nsin\n+ s1 + . . . ,\n(27)\nSL (l) = ln\n3\n\u03c0\nL\nwhere s1 is a non-universal constant and where the corrections are small when the chord length is large [89\u2013\n95]. As may be seen in Fig. 14(a), the numerically extracted central charge of the MC phase yields c = 1, as\none would expect for a single free boson, with coexisting gapped degrees of freedom; the adjacent panel shows\nthe same results plotted against the conformal distance\n \u0303l \u2261 ln[(L/\u03c0) sin(\u03c0l/L)] in order to yield a linear slope of\nc/3. It may be seen from Fig. 14(c) that the AC+MC\nphase also has c = 1. Note that it is not c = 2 as would\nbe the case for two independent Luttinger liquids.

Entanglement entropy SL (l) obtained by DMRG\nwith L = 64 and periodic boundaries. We consider horizontal\nscans through Fig. 1 with U = 0.5 and U = 0.7. (a) Within\nthe MC phase with \u000fm = \u22123.5 we find c \u2248 1 corresponding to\na gapless superfluid. (b) In the vicinity of the MC to AC+MC\nquantum phase transition we find c \u2248 3/2. This corresponds\nto the presence of additional gapless Ising degrees of freedom\ncoexisting with superfluidity. (c) Within the AC+MC phase\nwith \u000fm = \u22124 we find c \u2248 1 corresponding to an effective free\nboson. The panels on the right correspond to the same data\nas on the left, but are plotted against the conformal distance\n \u0303\nl \u2261 ln[(L/\u03c0) sin(\u03c0l/L)] in order to yield a linear plot with\nslope c/3. The offset between the different curves within each\npanel is due to the non-universal contribution in Eq. (27).\n\nreflects the coupled nature of the atomic and molecular condensates in the AC+MC phase, with additional\ngapped Ising degrees of freedom; the Feshbach term is\nrelevant and drives the Z2 sector massive. Close to the\nMC to AC+MC transition, where the anticipated Ising\ngap closes, one expects the central charge to increase to\nc = 3/2, due to additional critical Ising degrees of freedom with c = 1/2. This is confirmed by our DMRG\nsimulations in Fig. 14(b). Further support for this Z2\ntransition is obtained from the difference [96],\n\u2206S(L) \u2261 SL (L/2) \u2212 SL/2 (L/4) =\n\nc\nln(2) + . . . , (28)\n3\n\nas a function of \u000fm .

We have checked that this atomic KT behavior persists in Fig. 1 up to a value of \u000fm = \u22123.5;\nsee Fig. 15(d). It is notable that the finite-size effects\nin Fig. 15(d) are much stronger than those in Fig. 15(c),\nalthough both are compatible with c \u2248 1 at the MI transition. A detailed analysis of the multicritical region in\nFig. 1 requires further investigation.\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\nFIG. 15. Entanglement entropy difference \u2206S(L) on transiting across the phase boundaries shown in Fig. 1. We use periodic boundaries with up to L = 64 and work away from the\nmulticritical point.

(b) The transition from MC to MI\nyields c \u2248 1 and is consistent with a molecular KT transition.\n(c) The transition from AC+MC to MI with \u000fm = 4 yields\nc \u2248 1 and is consistent with an atomic KT transition. (d) The\ntransition from AC+MC to MI with \u000fm = \u22123.5 appears to be\ncompatible with the approach towards c \u2248 1 with increasing\nL, although the finite-size effects are stronger than those in\npanel (c). Panels (a) and (c) are adapted from Ref. [63].\n\nIsing Correlation Length\n\nThe Ising correlation length, \u03be, may be obtained\nfrom the atomic and molecular correlation functions discussed in Sec. IV B. Within the Z2 disordered MC phase\nthe atomic correlations ha\u2020 (x)a(0)i \u223c x\u2212\u03bdm /4 K0 (x/\u03be)\ndecay exponentially, whilst the molecular correlations\nhm\u2020 (x)m(0)i \u223c x\u2212\u03bdm decay as a power-law. At a\ngiven point in parameter space we may use the molecular Green's function to determine the exponent \u03bdm ,\nand thereby extract the Ising correlation length from the\natomic correlations. This approach is outlined in Fig. 16.\nIn the vicinity of an Ising quantum phase transition one\nexpects that \u03be \u22121 \u223c |M \u2212 Mc |\u03bd where \u03bd = 1 is the Ising\ncorrelation length exponent and M is a suitable mass\nscale parameterizing the departure from criticality. Unfortunately, it is non-trivial to express M in terms of the\nmicroscopic parameters of the lattice model (1). A naive\n\u221a\nanalysis gives M \u223c \u03ba0 + \u03ba1 \u03c1m + \u03ba2 \u03c1m , where \u03c1m is the\ndensity of molecules, and \u03ba0 \u223c \u000fa , \u03ba1 \u223c Uam , \u03ba2 \u223c 2g\nare constants.\nExpanding \u221athe square root according to\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03c1m \u2248 \u03c1cm + (\u03c1m \u2212 \u03c1cm )/ \u03c1cm suggests that sufficiently\nclose to the Ising transition\n\u03be \u22121 \u221d |\u03c1m \u2212 \u03c1cm |.\n\nquantum phase transition obtained via the vanishing of\nthe single-particle gap, E1g = 0, as shown in Fig. 1; see\nFig. 15(a). The evolution with increasing system size is\nconsistent with the passage towards c = 1 in the superfluid phases, and c = 3/2 in the vicinity of the transition.\nThis behavior may be contrasted with that observed at\nthe superfluid-MI transitions in Fig. 1, away from the\nmulticritical point. As may be seen in Fig. 15(b), in\npassing from the MC phase to the MI, the central charge\nremains pinned at unity.

(b) Using the previous exponent \u03bdm \u2248 0.18 we extract\nthe Ising correlation length \u03be \u2248 43.6 from the exponential decay of ha\u2020i aj i \u223c |i \u2212 j|\u2212\u03bdm /4 K0 (|i \u2212 j|/\u03be). (c) Repeating the\nabove procedure we plot \u03be \u22121 (circles) versus the departure\nof the molecular density \u03c1m from its value \u03c1cm at the MC to\nAC+MC transition. Close to the transition the results are in\ngood agreement with the Ising relation \u03be \u22121 \u223c |\u03c1m \u2212\u03c1cm |\u03bd with\n\u03bd = 1.

In order to test\nthe validity of Eq. (30), we must first extract the Ising\norder parameter from a finite-size scaling analysis of the\natomic correlations. As follows from Eq. (16), within the\nZ2 ordered AC+MC phase one has\nha\u2020 (x)a(0)i = Ah\u03c6i2 x\u2212\u03bdm /4 ,\n\n(31)\n\nwhere A is a normalization amplitude.

Repeating this procedure for\ndifferent system sizes one obtains an estimate for Ah\u03c6i2\nin the thermodynamic limit; see Fig. 17(b). In Fig. 18\nwe show the variation of this order parameter with the\nmolecular density. The results are in good agreement\nwith the theoretical prediction in Eq.

Changing the\nfitting interval gives an estimate of the error bars. (b) Extrapolation of Ah\u03c6i2 to the thermodynamic limit using linear\nextrapolation of the largest three system sizes is indicated by\nthe solid line. An estimate of the error bars in the thermodynamic limit is obtained by comparing to a quadratic fit of\nthe data shown by the dashed line.

We have presented a wide variety\nof evidence in favor of an Ising quantum phase transition separating distinct paired superfluids. We have also\nprovided a detailed characterization of these phases, including the behavior close to the Mott insulating phase\nboundary. For the investigated parameters, our DMRG\nresults are consistent with an Ising quantum phase transition approaching both a molecular KT transition and an\natomic KT transition. This is compatible with mean field\ntheory predictions for the continuum model in higher dimensions. However, recent results for pairing phases in\na 2D classical XY model suggest the possibility that the\nIsing transition may over-extend beyond the multicritical\npoint [53]. In view of this possibility, in a distinct but\nclosely related model, it would be profitable to explore\nthe multicritical region in more detail. A clear verdict on\nthis issue for the present 1D quantum model requires further analytical and numerical investigation and we will\nreturn to this question in future work. It would also be\ninteresting to explore the phase diagram for a broader\nrange of parameters, with a specific focus on the choice\nof atomic species and experimental constraints. Even in\nthe presence of strong three body losses, the emergent\nphase diagram may exhibit notable similarities [45\u201351].\n\n0.05\n\n(b)\n0\n\n-3.68\n\n-3.66\n\n\u01ebm\n\n-3.64\n\n-3.62\n\nFIG. 20.

(b) Evolution of the excitation gap E1g with\nincreasing nr , showing very little change beyond nr = 5.\n\nt/U , where inter-site hopping is strongly favored, one\nshould check the validity of this approximation. Here we\ndiscuss the evolution of physical observables with increasing Hilbert space restriction parameter, nr = na = nm .\nFor the largest value of 1/U = 2.5 used in Fig. 1, the\nresults converge with increasing nr . For example, in\nFig. 20(a) we show the evolution of the ground state energy E0 with increasing nr . The results show very little\nvariation beyond nr = 5. Likewise, in Fig. 20(b) we\nmonitor the excitation gap E1g with increasing nr . The\ndata again show very little change beyond nr = 5. The\nassociated MC to AC+MC phase boundary in Fig. 1 is\ntherefore robust to increasing nr . In a similar fashion, in\nFigs. 21 and 22, we examine the evolution of the atomic\nand molecular correlation functions. The results show\nclear convergence in both the MC and AC+MC phases.\nThe excellent agreement between our DMRG results and\nfield theory predictions also lends a postiori support for\nthis level of Hilbert space restriction with nr = 5.\n\n\f16\n1\n\n1\n0.8\n\n1\u00d710\n\n-4\n\n0.6\n1\u00d710\n\n-8\n\n\u2020\n\n0\n1\n\n1\u00d710\n\n1\u00d710\n\n\u2020\n\n(a) hai aji\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\nnr =\nnr =\nnr =\nnr =\n\n-6\n\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n(b) hm i mji\n\n0.4\n\n1\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n0.8\n0.6\n\n-12\n\n\u2020\n\n\u2020\n\n(c) hai aji\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n0.4\n\n|i\u2212j|\n\n(d) hm i mji\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n|i\u2212j|\n\nFIG. 21.
