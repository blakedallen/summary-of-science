importance for understanding the Universe that we reside in. Specifically, knowledge of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and its foregrounds \u2013 including the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich\n(SZ) effect from clusters of galaxies and radio point sources \u2013 tell us about the Universe\non its very largest scales, and also what the Universe is made of.\nWe describe the creation of software to carry out large numbers of virtual sky simulations. The simulations include the CMB, SZ effect and point sources, and are designed to examine the effects of point sources and the SZ effect on present and recent\nobservations of the CMB. Utilizing sets of 1,000 simulations, we find that the power\nspectrum resulting from the SZ effect is expected to have a larger standard deviation\nby a factor of 3 than would be expected from purely Gaussian realizations. It also\nhas a distribution that is significantly skewed towards increased values for the power\nspectrum, especially when small map sizes are used. The effects of the clustering of\ngalaxy clusters, residual point sources and uncertainties in the gas physics are also investigated, as are the implications for the excess power measured in the CMB power\nspectrum by the CBI and BIMA experiments. We also investigate the possibility of\nusing the One Centimetre Receiver Array (OCRA) receivers to observe the CMB and\nmeasure this high-multipole excess.\nAn automated data reduction package has been created for the OCRA receivers,\nwhich has been used in end-to-end simulations for OCRA-p observations of point\nsources. We find that these simulations are able to realistically simulate the noise\npresent in real observations, and that the introduction of 1/ f noise into the simulations\nsignificantly reduces the predicted ability of the instruments to observe weak sources\nby measuring the sources for long periods of time.\nThe OCRA-p receiver has been used to observe point sources in the Very Small Array fields so that they can be subtracted from observations of the CMB power spectrum.\n\n17\n\n\fWe find that these point sources are split between steep and flat spectrum sources. We\nhave also observed 550 CRATES flat spectrum radio sources, which will be useful for\ncomparison to Planck satellite observations.\nFinally, the assembly and commissioning of the OCRA-F receiver is outlined. This\nreceiver is now installed on the Toru\u0144 32-m telescope, and is currently being calibrated\nprior to starting observations in the next few months.\nThis thesis was submitted by Michael Peel to The University of Manchester for the\ndegree of Doctor of Philosophy in the Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences\non the 18th December 2009.\n\n18\n\n\fDeclaration\n\nI declare that no portion of the work referred to in the thesis has been submitted in\nsupport of an application for another degree or qualification of this or any other\nuniversity or other institute of learning.\n\n19\n\n\fCopyright Statement\n\n(i) The author of this thesis (including any appendices and/or schedules to this thesis) owns any copyright in it (the \"Copyright\") and they have given The University of Manchester the right to use such Copyright for any administrative,\npromotional, educational and/or teaching purposes.\n(ii) Copies of this thesis, either in full or in extracts, may be made only in accordance\nwith the regulations of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester.

Over four hundred years ago, the first\ntelescopes were turned to the skies, giving us a closer look at the known astronomical\nobjects and the ability to search for fainter, undiscovered objects. A vital component\nof all of these observations for many thousands of years was the human eye \u2013 however\nthat can only see light at visible wavelengths. Photography replaced the human eye\nfor astronomical observations in the 19th century, but again was focused on the small\nrange of frequencies surrounding the optical regime.\nWhen Karl Jansky and Reber first used radio frequency technology for astronomy\nin 1930-40, humanity gained a new view of the Universe. This new window enables us\nto look back to the very earliest stages of our Universe, and see the photons that make\nup the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). By observing this carefully (measuring\nits temperature to an accuracy of one part in a million) we can deduce the fundamental\nproperties of our observable universe, telling us how much mass our Universe contains\nand of what type, and also what scales it is distributed on.\nMatter on the very largest scales \u2013 that of clusters of galaxies \u2013 casts shadows on\nthe CMB via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (hereafter the SZ effect). Very careful\nmeasurements of these shadows provide information about the behaviour of matter on\nthese very large scales. By surveying them, we can weigh the Universe, and study\n\n29\n\n\f1: INTRODUCTION\n\nits growth over time. We can also learn about the individual galaxy clusters at the\nsame time, learning about the distribution of gas within the clusters. The formation\nof structures within our universe is summarized in Section 1.1. Clusters of galaxies,\ntheir emission at optical, X-ray and radio frequencies, and the cosmology that can be\ndone by observing them, are then reviewed in Section 1.2. Sources of confusion for\nobservations of galaxy clusters at radio frequencies are then summarized in Section\n1.3.\nWhilst optical observations now use charged-coupled devices (CCDs) that have\nmany millions of pixels, radio astronomy traditionally uses single pixels, or techniques\nsuch as interferometry, to painstakingly build up maps of the sky over a long period of\ntime. This is especially problematic at the shortest wavelengths \u2013 those around a centimetre or millimetre in size \u2013 where the primary beams of large telescopes (and hence\nthe map pixels for observations from a single telescope) cover very small areas of the\nsky. The advent of radio cameras \u2013 arrays of radio frequency pixels \u2013 promises to make\nlarge scale surveys possible much more quickly than with single pixels. The One Centimetre Receiver Array (OCRA) currently consists of a pair of prototype instruments\naimed towards the development of a \u223c100 pixel radio camera at wavelengths of 30 GHz\n(1 cm). These instruments are summarized in Section 1.4. Finally, an overview of this\nThesis is given in Section 1.5.\n\n1.1\n\nStructure formation\n\nThe origin of the structure within our Universe lies within the first 10\u221236 s of the Big\nBang. It is thought that inflation in the very early universe amplified quantum fluctuations, which formed the seeds of the anisotropic structure that we see around us.\nThese fluctuations gave rise to the temperature anisotropies present in the CMB, and\ngravitational waves from this era may be detectable in the structure of the polarization\nof the CMB radiation.\nGravitational instabilities then caused the growth of structures within our Universe,\n\n30\n\n\f1.2: CLUSTERS OF GALAXIES\n\nFigure 1.1: Slices through the \"Millennium Simulation\", showing the distribution of\ndark matter and its evolution to form a cluster of galaxies.

Credit:\nSpringel et al. (2005).\nwith matter evolving linearly and establishing a \"cosmic web\" with filamentary structures separated by voids. The gravitational instabilities lead to the formation of small\ngalaxies first, with their mergers giving rise to larger galaxies as well as groups and\nclusters of galaxies. This evolution is driven by dark matter, with normal matter (predominantly in the form of gas) only becoming important on small scales within galaxies. The process of structure formation has been well studied using N-body simulations, for example the \"Millennium Simulation\" (Springel et al. 2005) as depicted in\nFigure 1.1. For a review of inflation and structure formation, see e.g. Liddle & Lyth\n(2000).\n\n1.2\n\nClusters of galaxies\n\nThe largest structures to form, and hence the most recent, are clusters of galaxies. A\ngalaxy cluster is defined as a set of over 50 galaxies in close (. 2Mpc) proximity to\neach other; sets of galaxies smaller than this are termed \"galaxy groups\". Pioneering\nwork on the classification of galaxy clusters was done by Abell (1958), leading to the\ndefinition of a \"richness\" factor that depends on the number of constituent galaxies\n\n31\n\n\f1: INTRODUCTION\n\nthat can be allotted to each cluster, spanning from Class 0 (30-49 galaxies) to Class 5\n(300+ galaxies).\nGalaxy clusters emit radiation across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Optical and infrared observations can locate individual galaxies; however, only about 10\nper cent of the baryonic mass of a cluster is contained within the galaxies. The rest\nforms the IntraCluster Medium (ICM; also known as the intergalactic medium or the\nintracluster plasma). The majority of this is hot gas concentrated in the center of the\ncluster, where it is heated predominantly by energy from the infall of matter into the\ngravitational well of the galaxy cluster (although other effects also provide sources of\nenergy). Due to its temperature, it emits thermal radiation peaking at X-ray wavelengths. It can also be observed via its effect on photons from the CMB \u2013 the SZ\neffect. The SZ effect has cosmological importance as it provides a tracer for locating\nclusters of galaxies, the distribution of which can provide constraints on fundamental\ncosmological parameters.\nThe baryonic mass of a cluster only makes up around a seventh of its total mass\n(e.g. Ostriker et al. 2005). The remainder consists of dark matter, probably in the\nform of a cluster halo and a series of sub-haloes, which are most likely associated with\nindividual galaxies. The presence of this dark matter can be inferred both from the\napplication of the virial theorem to the motions of galaxies within the cluster as well\nas gravitational lensing. Its distribution can potentially be related to the distribution of\ngalaxies (and hence radio sources) within the cluster.\n\n1.2.1\n\nOptical and infrared observations\n\nClusters of galaxies have been identified using optical wavelengths since the late 18th\ncentury (see Biviano 2000, for a historical review). The classical catalogue for the\nsubject is that published by Abell (1958) (also Abell et al. 1989), which focuses on\nclusters with more than 50 component galaxies that are fairly close to our Galaxy, i.e.\nwith redshifts up to z \u2248 0.2.\n\n32\n\n\f1.2: CLUSTERS OF GALAXIES\n\nFigure 1.2: The Galaxy Cluster Abell 2218 at optical wavelengths, as imaged by the\nHubble Space Telescope. A bright, central galaxy is visible, surrounded by arcs caused\nby weak lensing of a background galaxy. Credit: NASA, ESA, and Johan Richard\n(Caltech, USA). License: Public Domain.\nOptical observations show that there is frequently a Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG)\nor a first-ranked galaxy at the centre of galaxy clusters. These massive, luminous galaxies only appear in clusters \u2013 never in the field \u2013 and are mostly evolved and elliptical.\nAround 20 per cent are surrounded by a low surface brightness envelope; these are also\ncalled cD galaxies (Oegerle & Hill 2001; Seigar et al. 2007).\nCluster galaxies can also be split up into several groups depending on their positions on a colour-magnitude diagram; these are the red and blue sequences. The red\ngalaxies in the cluster are old and passively evolving, and form a tight sequence in\ncolour-magnitude diagrams (De Lucia et al. 2004). They can be used to locate clusters\n(e.g. the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey, Gladders & Yee 2000).\nSpectroscopy forms an important part of the optical observations of galaxies in\nclusters, as it allows the redshifts of the clusters to be measured to high precision\n(\u2206z \u223c 0.01), as well as providing measurements of the velocity dispersion amongst\n\n33\n\n\f1: INTRODUCTION\n\nthe galaxies. Large-scale surveys aimed at obtaining redshifts for large numbers of\ngalaxies are currently in progress, for example the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS;\nYork et al. 2000) which started in 2000 and is still ongoing, and the WiggleZ Dark\nEnergy Survey (Drinkwater et al. 2009).\nGalaxy clusters are complicated, diffuse objects in the optical regime (see Figure\n1.2). It often proves tricky to differentiate between cluster galaxies and foreground\ngalaxies (hence the selection methods used by Abell 1958). In general, spectroscopic\nobservations of the galaxies are needed to identify their redshifts, so that their line-ofsight distances are known. N-body techniques such as friends-of-friends can also be\napplied to select the cluster galaxies (Clewley et al. 2007).\n\n1.2.2\n\nX-ray emission\n\nDue to the temperature of the gas in the ICM, thermal emission is given off as Xrays mostly via thermal bremsstrahlung, but also through line radiation. The spectral\nsurface brightness at energy E along a particular line of sight l is given by (Birkinshaw\n1999)\n1\nb(\u03b8, E) =\n4\u03c0(1 + z)3\n\nZ\n\nne (\u03b8)2 \u039b(E(\u03b8), T e (\u03b8))dl,\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere z is the redshift of the cluster, ne (\u03b8) is the electron number density at a distance\n\u03b8 from the center of the cluster and \u039b(E, T e ) is the spectral emissivity at energy E(\u03b8)\nof a gas at temperature T e (\u03b8); \u039b(E, T e ) is generally a complicated function. A related\nparameter is the cooling function, which gives the total energy emitted from a gas at\ntemperature T e .\nThe intensity of X-rays emitted depends on the square of the electron density, hence\nX-ray observations predominantly see the emission from cores of the galaxy clusters\nrather than the outskirts of the cluster. The gas in the cluster center can be subject to\ncomplicating effects including heating and cooling (see e.g. Motl et al. 2005), and the\nX-ray emission is also sensitive to clumps and shocks in the ICM (see Figure 1.3).\n\n34\n\n\f1.2: CLUSTERS OF GALAXIES\n\nFigure 1.3: The Bullet Cluster (1E 0657-56) in X-ray and optical.

The\nphotons gain energy from the electrons and are hence shifted up in frequency, meaning\nthat the SZ effect is manifested as a decrement in the CMB at low frequencies and an\nincrement at high frequencies, with a null at 217GHz. It was predicted by Sunyaev &\nZeldovich (1970, 1972), based on earlier work by Weymann (1966) and Zeldovich &\nSunyaev (1969). It can be parameterized by the Compton y(\u03b8) parameter, which represents the integrated pressure along the line of sight l at a distance \u03b8 from the center of\nthe cluster, by (Birkinshaw 1999)\n\u03c3T kB\ny(\u03b8) =\nme c2\n\nZ\nne (\u03b8)T e (\u03b8) dl,\n\n(1.2)\n\n35\n\n\f1: INTRODUCTION\n\nwhere \u03c3T is the Thomson scattering cross-section, kB is Boltzmann's constant, me is\nthe electron mass, c is the speed of light, ne (\u03b8) is again the number density of electrons\nand T e (\u03b8) is the temperature of the electrons. Note that this equation does not include\nz \u2013 the effect is redshift independent. Relativistic corrections to this equation can be\nfound in e.g. Itoh et al. (1998).\nThe SZ effect resulting from the hot gas in a cluster or group of galaxies produces\na detectable flux density S at frequency \u03bd by\n2\u03bd2 kB T CMB\nS\u03bd =\nf (x)\nc2\n\nZ\ny(\u03b8)d\u03a9,\n\n(1.3)\n\nwhere the integral is over the observed section of sky and f (x) = x2 e x g(x)/(e x \u2212 1)2\nrepresents the frequency dependence of the effect, in which g(x) = (x/ tanh(x/2)) \u2212 4\nand the dimensionless frequency x = h\u03bd/kB T CMB . T CMB is the present-day temperature\nof the CMB.\nThe SZ effect has a major advantage with locating clusters compared to optical and\nX-ray methods in that the magnitude of the effect does not depend on redshift, and as\nsuch it should be possible to observe clusters of galaxies out to high redshifts relatively\neasily. Additionally, the SZ effect only depends on ne , not n2e as in X-ray, so the outer\npart of the cluster atmosphere can also be observed, and less complications will arise\nfrom substructure and cooling/heating effects within the cluster (Motl et al. 2005).\nSince the first observations of the SZ effect in the 1970s (Birkinshaw et al. 1978),\na number of experiments have measured the effect in galaxy clusters (e.g. Jones et al.\n1993; Grego et al. 2001; Wu et al. 2008; Plagge et al. 2009; Hincks et al. 2009, Lancaster et al. in prep.), although typically with sample sizes in the low double-digits.\nObservations with the Planck satellite, and ground-based experiments like the South\nPole Telescope (Ruhl et al. 2004), AMI (Zwart et al. 2008) and OCRA (Browne et al.\n2000), promise to increase the number of SZ detected clusters dramatically in the near\nfuture.\nThe SZ effect produced by clusters can be used for cosmology primarily via number counts. The expected number of detections depends on the total amount of matter\n\n36\n\n\f1.3: SOURCES OF CONTAMINATION AND CONFUSION\n\nwithin our Universe (\u03a9m ), as well as the normalization of the matter power spectrum\n(\u03c38 ) and the equation of state for dark energy (w). See Section 2.2 for details. Comparison of X-ray emission with the SZ effect signal can also provide measures of the\ncluster distance, and hence constraints on the Hubble constant (e.g. Birkinshaw et al.\n1991; Cunha et al. 2006). The frequency dependence of the SZ effect can also be used\nto measure T CMB at different redshifts (e.g. Luzzi et al. 2009).\nOnly the thermal SZ effect is considered here. A kinetic SZ effect also exists; see\ne.g. Section 5 of the review by Birkinshaw (1999). This effect can become significant\nwhen clusters have high velocities relative to the CMB.\n\n1.3\n\nSources of contamination and confusion\n\nThe main source of contamination for SZ observations of galaxy clusters at microwave\nfrequencies is point sources \u2013 radio-loud galaxies that lie in the direction of the galaxy\ncluster. These can either be physically associated with the cluster or they can be randomly distributed in front of, or behind, the cluster. At lower frequencies where the SZ\neffect causes a decrement in the CMB, these point sources can \"fill in\" the decrement\nand hence reduce the signal. Point sources that are present (in projection) to one side\nof the centre of a galaxy cluster can also present experimental difficulties, depending\non the configuration of the instrument making the observations.\nCMB anisotropies themselves can also be confused with SZ detections, again depending on the configuration and properties of the instrument. Whilst CMB anisotropies\nare dominant over the SZ effect only at large scales, if the beam of the instrument is not\nwell matched to the scale of the galaxy cluster being observed (typically \u223c 1 arcmin)\nthen the observations can include the effects of CMB anisotropies. This is also true of\nswitched beam systems where the beams are separated by more than \u223c 1 arcmin.\nGalactic emission presents a large foreground for galaxy clusters. This is especially\nthe case along the plane of our Galaxy. However Galactic emission also extends to\nhigh and low latitudes, and can present issues if the emission has a complex spatial\n\n37\n\n\f1: INTRODUCTION\n\ndistribution on arcminute scales. Fortunately, at these latitudes the emission is thought\nto be smooth enough that this is unlikely to be a major problem.\nComing down to earth, our own atmosphere presents a major observational challenge for ground-based observations, particularly at sea level. At microwave frequencies, water vapour in our atmosphere attenuates and emits radiation. As this water\nvapour is not evenly distributed across the sky (as evidenced by clouds) as it drifts\nthrough the telescope beam, this creates time-variable noise which, if not carefully\nsubtracted, causes contamination in the observations.\n\n1.4\n\nThe One Centimetre Receiver Array\n\nThe One Centimetre Receiver Array (OCRA) programme (Browne et al. 2000) is focused on developing multi-pixel arrays of continuum receivers at microwave frequencies. Two receivers have thus far been constructed \u2013 OCRA-p and OCRA-F \u2013 both of\nwhich operate at a wavelength around 1 cm (30 GHz). OCRA-p is a 2-beam prototype that has been observing on the Toru\u0144 32 m telescope in Poland since 2005, and\nOCRA-F is an 8-beam receiver array that is just starting observations from the same\nlocation.\nThe first receiver in the OCRA program was the OCRA prototype (OCRA-p). This\nis a two-beam pseudo-correlation receiver based upon the Planck LFI receiver chain,\nand is similar in design to the WMAP 23 GHz receiver. The two beams are combined\ntogether using a hybrid, then combinations of the signals passed through two Low\nNoise Amplifiers (LNAs) and a pair of phase switches. The signals are then separated\nby another hybrid, further amplified and square-law detected to measure the RF power.\nThe detected signals are subtracted from each other to get the difference in signal\nbetween the two beams. This reduces the effect of 1/ f noise from the LNAs and\nthe atmosphere. A full technical description of the implementation, commissioning\nprocess and initial observations with OCRA-p are detailed in Lowe (2006) (see also\nLowe et al. 2007).\n\n38\n\n\f1.5: THESIS STRUCTURE\n\nOCRA-p has been used to survey radio point sources, including the CJF sample\n(Lowe et al. 2007), the Very Small Array fields (Gawronski et al. 2009, also see Section\n5.2), the SENSE sample (Gupta et al. 2009) and the CRATES sample (see Section 5.3).\nIt has also been used to observe the SZ effect from clusters of galaxies (Lancaster et al.\n2007), novae (RS Ophuchi; Eyres et al. 2009) and planetary nebulae (Pazderska et al.\n2009).\nThe second generation of receiver is OCRA FARADAY (OCRA-F). This receiver\ncurrently has 8 beams, with the capacity for expansion to 16 beams; these are arranged\nin pairs. The receiver builds upon OCRA-p, following the same receiver chain pattern\nbut using Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuits (MMICs) in place of traditional\ncomponents (see Kettle & Roddis 2007b). The assembly, testing and commissioning\nof OCRA-F are described in this thesis (Chapter 6). OCRA-F will be used to do small\nscale blind surveys for point sources and for studying the SZ effect. It will also, within\ncertain limitations, be able to create maps of extended emission.\nThe ultimate goal of the OCRA program is to construct a 100 beam array, which\ncan then be used for large scale blind surveys of point sources and the SZ effect\n(Browne et al. 2000). The receiver technology required for such an instrument will be\nstudied in the next few years via the EC Framework 7 APRICOT (All Purpose Radio\nImaging Cameras On Telescopes) project within RadioNet, with the aim of combining\nspectroscopic and continuum measurements into one receiver package.\n\n1.5\n\nThesis structure\n\nThis chapter has provided an overview of structure formation, galaxy clusters in the\noptical, X-ray and microwave regimes, and the main sources of confusion for the SZ\neffect. It has also summarized the OCRA series of receivers.\nThe next chapter describes the creation of simulated maps of the CMB, SZ effect\nand point sources (\"Virtual Skies\"). These simulations are then utilized in Chapter 3,\nwhich examines the statistics of the power spectrum of the SZ effect and concludes\n\n39\n\n\f1: INTRODUCTION\n\nwith the possibility of measuring the CMB power spectrum at high multipoles using\nOCRA-F.\nData reduction software that has been written specifically to analyse measurements\nfrom the OCRA receiver is described in Chapter 4. The chapter also describes the\nassembly of this data reduction package with pre-existing software to simulate a telescope equipped with an OCRA receiver. Virtual Sky maps can then used as the input\nfor this software, such that end-to-end simulations of OCRA observations can be performed. The performance of the OCRA receivers for observing point sources is then\nevaluated using these end-to-end simulations.\nChapter 5 then uses the data reduction package to analyse observations by OCRA-p\nas part of two surveys \u2013 a survey of 121 radio sources within the five fields of the Super\nExtended Very Small Array, and a sample of 550 flat-spectrum radio sources selected\nfrom the CRATES sample.\nChapter 6 describes the assembly of the OCRA-F receiver as well as the testing\nand commissioning of the receiver both in the lab and on the Toru\u0144 32-m telescope,\nculminating in a description of its first light observations. Finally, Chapter 7 concludes\nthe thesis, and looks to the future work that can be done based on that described herewithin.\n\n40\n\n\f2\nCreating a Virtual Sky\nSeveral components need to be generated to create a virtual map of the sky at microwave frequencies. The first of these is the CMB, which forms the background to\neverything else. Then, the distribution of galaxy clusters needs to be generated, determining their positions on the sky as well as their redshifts and masses. Once this is\nknown, a cluster model needs to be used to create a map of the SZ effect. Finally, point\nsources need to be added, requiring the determination of their positions on the sky and\ntheir flux densities.\nThe effects of other foregrounds, including the galaxy, are not included as the observations focus on areas of the sky where galactic foregrounds are expected to be low.\nAdditionally, these foregrounds are expected to be fairly smooth on the scales under\nconsideration here.\nThese simulations of the microwave sky can be used to study the power spectra of\nthe different components, particularly the SZ effect, and for carrying out simulations of\nobservations (amongst other things). In this chapter, the methods of creating the maps\nare described; their use and results are given in Chapter 3. Similar work creating maps\nof the SZ effect has been carried out by e.g. Schfer et al. (2006), Geisbsch & Hobson\n(2007), Holder et al. (2007) and Sehgal et al. (2007, 2009).\nMaps are created both of small sections of the sky (\"flat sky\" maps) and of the\nwhole sky (using HEALPix; Gorski et al. 2005). The process of creating these maps is\n\n41\n\n\f2: CREATING A VIRTUAL SKY\n\nessentially the same; this chapter primarily focuses the former, with differences in the\ncreation of the latter described where appropriate.\nThroughout this chapter, unless otherwise stated, we use a canonical frequency of\n30 GHz, to ease comparisons with potential observations with the OCRA receiver, as\nwell as the observations of the high-multipole excess by CBI and BIMA (see Chapter\n3). We use a \u039bCDM cosmology throughout this thesis, with the ratio of the matter\ndensity compared to the critical density \u03a9m = 0.3, the same ratio for dark energy\n\u03a9\u039b = 0.7 and the ratio of baryons to critical density \u03a9b = 0.05. The Hubble constant\nH0 = 100 h100 kms\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , where h100 = 0.7. We use three values of \u03c38 : 0.75, 0.825\nand 0.9, with 0.825 as the default. These span the best-fitting values from WMAP after\n1, 3 and 5 years of observations (Spergel et al. 2003, 2007; Komatsu et al. 2009).\nThe process of generating maps of the CMB is described in Section 2.1. Section 2.2\ndescribes the construction of cluster catalogues, and Section 2.3 describes the cluster\nmodel; these two are then combined to create maps of the SZ effect, examples and\npower spectra for which are given in Section 2.4. Section 2.5 describes the calculation\nof the theoretical power spectra for the SZ effect, and compares this with that from\nthe realisations. Point sources are then added to the model in Section 2.6, before the\nsection is summarized in Section 2.7.\n\n2.1\n\nCosmic Microwave Background\n\nMaps of the small-scale CMB anisotropies can be computed using the standard assumption that the CMB is a Gaussian random field and hence is completely described\nby its angular power spectrum, Cl . We generate the expected power spectrum of the\ngravitationally lensed CMB from CAMB1 (Lewis et al. 2000).

We use the Fastest Fourier Transform in the West2 (FFTW3; Frigo & Johnson\n2005) package to carry out the required 2-dimensional complex-to-real Fourier transforms between the power spectra and the maps.\nThe relationship between spherical harmonics and Fourier modes is simply l = |k|,\nwhere k = 2\u03c0m/\u03b8map is the mth Fourier mode of the map. \u03b8map is the width of the map\nq\nin radians, and m = m2x + m2y , in which mx and my are the integer Fourier modes in\nthe x- and y-directions of the map.\nWe use the 2-dimensional real to complex discrete Fourier transform, such that\nthe map Mx,y only has a real component, while Fourier space Fmx ,my has both real and\ncomplex components.

The statistics are\nconsistent with a Gaussian distribution with a slightly larger standard deviation than\nexpected from cosmic variance due to inefficiencies in the sampling of the spectrum\nat different multipoles.

Most common are N-body simulations; these are generally used for looking\nat the distributions of clusters (e.g. Retzlaff et al. 1998; Evrard et al. 2002) and their\nevolution over time. As a result, they can provide expected mass functions and number\ncounts, e.g. Jenkins et al. (2001). Additionally, they can be used to investigate the\ndistribution of dark matter within haloes.\nAdditional detail can be simulated by adding hydrodynamical simulations to Nbody simulations. These consist of solving the hydrodynamical equations with various\nphysical effects, such as radiative cooling, adiabatic compression and shock heating,\nand are therefore useful for simulating the distributed material such as the intracluster\nmedium (see e.g. Muanwong et al. 2002).\nVirtual cluster catalogues can be obtained from these simulations, which can then\nbe used directly to create maps by applying models of clusters at each cluster position;\nfor a recent example of this, see Schfer et al. (2006). However, there are a limited\nnumber of these catalogues available due to the amount of computing power required\nfor each simulation; for example, the gigaparticle (109 ) simulation run by Evrard et al.\n(2002) took around 7 months to run on a 512-CPU computer. An alternative approach\nis to use theoretical equations calibrated by the simulations to create similar maps\ncomparatively easily and much quicker; this approach is described in Section 2.2.1.\nMaps can also be created using N-body simulation output (Section 2.2.2), as well as\nusing Pinocchio simulations (Section 2.2.3).\n\n2.2.1\n\nAnalytical formulae\n\nThe dependence of the number of clusters with z is given by\nZ \u221e\ndN\ndV\ndN\n= \u2206\u03a9\n(z)\n(M, z)dM,\ndz\ndzd\u03a9\nMlim (z) dM\n\n(2.10)\n\nwhere \u2206\u03a9 is the solid angle of the sky being looked at, dN/dM(M, z) is the comoving number density of clusters with mass M and redshift z, and also called the mass\nfunction. Mlim (z) is the minimum mass that is being considered (this is usually the\n\n47\n\n\f2: CREATING A VIRTUAL SKY\n\nminimum detectable mass, which generally depends on redshift). This can easily be\nadapted to give the number of clusters in a given mass range.\n2\n\ndV\nr(z)\n=\n=\ndzd\u03a9 H(z)\n\n\u0010R z\n0\n\nH \u22121 (z0 )dz0\n\n\u00112\n\n\u0010R z\n=\n\n0\n\nE \u22121 (z0 )dz0\n\n\u00112\n\n(2.11)\nE(z)H03\nis the comoving volume in a flat universe, in which r(z) is the coordinate distance.

D(z) is the growth factor, which is normalized by D(0) = 1; the dependence on\nredshift can be found by solving the perturbation equation for matter fluctuations (see\ne.g. Battye & Weller 2003), D(z) = \u03b4m (z)/\u03b4m (0), where \u03b4m (z) is found by numerically\nsolving\n\u03b400m +\n\n3\n3\n[1 \u2212 \u03c9(a)(1 \u2212 \u03a9m (a))]\u03b40m \u2212 2 \u03a9m (a)\u03b4m = 0.\n2a\n2a\n\n(2.14)\n\nThe over-density as a function of mass is calculated using a spherical top hat window function and the linear power spectrum (based upon the transfer function T (k)),\nZ kmax\n2\n\u03c3 (R) =\nW 2 (kR)4\u03c0k2 P(k) dk.\n(2.15)\nkmin\n\nThe transfer function is calculated using CAMB (Lewis et al. 2000). The conversion\nbetween mass M and radius R is via M = 4\u03c0\u03a9m \u03c1crit (t0 )R3 /3. Equation 2.15 is numerically differentiated to get d\u03c3/dM.

A 2D probability distribution as a function\nof mass and redshift is calculated using Equation 2.10, and a catalogue of individual\ncluster masses and redshifts is then obtained by using a random number generator to\nsample from this probability distribution.\n\n2.2.2\n\nN-body simulations\n\nThe simplest method of positioning clusters on the sky is to Poisson distribute them, i.e.\nby generating the positions from a uniform distribution. However, this will not create\nthe clustering of the clusters that is expected from theory and N-body simulations.\nThere are several sources of this clustering. First, early galaxy clusters are formed\nat peaks in the density fluctuations set up by quantum fluctuations in the early universe;\nthis will impart a specific distribution upon them. This is most important with the distribution of high-mass clusters, which will have subsequently evolved approximately\nlinearly with time via gravity. Second, clusters will gravitationally attract each other\nin a non-linear way. This is more important with smaller clusters or groups than large\nones, as they will tend to cluster around the larger clusters. The third, and most complicated, source of clustering is due to mergers and close encounters between clusters.\nAs these effects are included within N-body and hydrodynamical simulations (down to\n\n49\n\n\f2: CREATING A VIRTUAL SKY\n\na scale size that depends on the resolution of the simulations and the physical effects\nthat they incorporate), the cluster catalogues from them can be used to create maps\ncontaining realistic clustering of the galaxy clusters.\nN-body simulations can also be used to calibrate the analytical mass functions.\nEvrard et al. (2002) provide a fit for the mass function at z = 0, which can be generalized in redshift to give\n!\ndN\nM200 \u03a9m \u03c1crit (t0 ) d ln \u03c3\u22121 (Mvir )\n=\nA\nexp[\u2212| ln[\u03c3\u22121 (Mvir )]\u2212ln[D(z)]+B|\u000f ], (2.19)\n2\ndM\nMvir\nd ln M\nM200\nwhere M200 is the cluster mass within an overdensity of 200 times the critical density (see Equation 2.26; calculated at z=0), A, B and \u000f are parameters that can be\nfound by fitting to the simulation. They provide values for these parameters for both a\n\u039bCDM cosmology and a nonrelativistic cold dark matter-dominated cosmology (\u03a9m =\n1, \u03a9\u039b = 0; denoted \u03c4CDM). To account for \u03a9M varying with redshift in \u039bCDM, where\nit approaches 1 at high redshifts, they interpolate between the two sets of parameters\nby\nA(\u03a9m (z)) = (1 \u2212 x)A(\u03c4CDM) + xA(\u039bCDM),\n\n(2.20)\n\nwith x = (1 \u2212 \u03a9m (z))/0.7, using similar equations for B and \u000f.\nEvrard et al.

Pinocchio uses Lagrangian perturbation theory to predict the collapse\nof matter into haloes. Galaxy cluster positions and masses generated by Pinocchio\nwill be associated with the large-scale cosmological structure, and hence will have a\nnon-zero two-point correlation function (they will be clustered), whereas distributions\ncreated from analytical mass functions with random cluster positions will be Poisson\ndistributed with zero two-point correlations. Pinocchio does not simulate the structure\nwithin haloes, thus offering a significantly faster method of creating cluster catalogues\ncompared with N-body techniques. In contrast to N-body simulations, requiring many\nthousands of CPU-hours to run, a reasonable resolution Pinocchio run takes less than\na day on a single CPU.\nWe have run 100 Pinocchio simulations for three values of \u03c38 \u2013 0.7, 0.825 and 0.9\n\u2013 each simulating comoving cubes with sides of 500 Mpc with a cell size of 1.25 Mpc\n(thus 400 cells to a side). Halo catalogues were created at 50 redshifts between z = 5\nand z = 0, the centres of which are spaced 160 Mpc apart in comoving distance. The\ninitial power spectrum used to generate the distribution of matter in the simulation is\nfrom Efstathiou et al. (1992).\nA set of 1000 lightcone catalogues for each value of \u03c38 were generated from the\nsimulation output. For each of the 50 redshifts, a halo catalogue is randomly selected\nfrom the 100 simulations. This halo catalogue is then translated by random amounts,\nindependently in all three dimensions using a periodic box, as well as being rotated by\na randomly chosen integer multiple of 90\u25e6 independently along each of the three axes.\nA 160 Mpc deep slice of the simulation is then taken, and clusters within a 3\u25e6 \u00d7 3\u25e6\nblock centred on the middle of the slice are included in the lightcone.

The resolutions are 2.5 Mpc (blue short dashed line),\n1.66 Mpc (black dotted line) and 1.25 Mpc (red solid line; our adopted resolution). The\nlatter two are consistent with each other down to Mvir \u223c 1013 M . At Mvir = 1013 M the\nmass function from the highest resolution simulation is in good agreement with that\nfrom ST99 for a resolution of 1.25 Mpc. At the highest masses the scatter is caused by\nsmall number statistics, but a systematic trend downwards is still present.\nto a side is imposed by the size of the simulation at the highest redshift; the box size\nsubtends an angle of 3\u25e6 at z = 5.\nThe choice of simulation resolution means that the simulations have a high degree\nof completeness down to Mvir = 1013 M ; that is, the comoving number density of\nclusters n(M) = dn/dM agrees between the Pinocchio simulations and that expected\nfrom ST99, as shown in Figure 2.4. However, Pinocchio systematically underestimates\nthe number of the largest mass clusters when compared to the analytical prediction of\nST99; this becomes more pronounced at higher redshifts (see Figure 2.5). This is\nunexpected since Pinocchio is designed to reproduce ST99, and causes a significant\ndiscrepancy in the amplitude of the power spectrum of the SZ effect compared with\nmaps created from random cluster catalogues generated from the ST99 number count\npredictions.\nWe assume that the ST99 mass function is the more accurate of the two, given the\nextensive comparisons that have been made between this mass function and numerical\n\n52\n\n\f2.2: DISTRIBUTION OF GALAXY CLUSTERS\n\n-3\n\nlog(dn (>M) / dM / Mpc3)\n\n-4\n-5\n-6\n-7\n-8\n-9\n-10\n13\n\n13.5\n\n14\n\n14.5\nlog(M / M\u2299)\n\n15\n\n15.5\n\n16\n\nFigure 2.5: The comoving differential number count of clusters greater than a given\nmass analytically from ST99 (dashed lines), from the mean mass function of all Pinocchio catalogues with \u03c38 = 0.9 (red +) and from the corrected Pinocchio catalogues\n(blue crosses).

The correction brings the two mass functions into agreement.\nsimulations (see e.g. Warren et al. 2006), although Warren et al. (2006) show that this\nmay itself be systematically low at the highest masses compared to N-body simulations. We calculate a mass correction table for each cosmology such that the number\nof clusters greater than a given mass at each redshift (calculated from the average of all\nof the simulations with the same cosmology) matches the predicted value from ST99.\nThe appropriate correction is then applied to all clusters in the lightcone prior to the\ncreation of the maps.\nThe effect of this correction is shown in Figure 2.5, which gives the differential\nnumber count of clusters greater than a given mass before and after the correction has\nbeen applied. The correction brings the Pinocchio spectrum into agreement with that\ngenerated from a set of 1000 cluster catalogues with mass and redshift values drawn\nfrom the ST99 mass function and randomly determined positions.

Although clusters undergo major mergers, these are relatively\ninfrequent, occurring in around 10 to 20 percent of the population depending on the\nredshift (Kay et al. 2008).\nThe cluster model we utilize is spherically symmetric and consists of two components: the dark matter and the gas. The former is used to calculate the surface mass\ndensity of the cluster, used for the inclusion of point sources, and the latter gives the\nthermal SZ effect. A kinetic SZ effect also exists, which is created by the relative\nmotion of the clusters to the CMB, but this is likely to be negligible compared to the\nthermal SZ effect at the frequencies discussed in this paper and hence is not considered\nhere.\n\n54\n\n\f2.3: GALAXY CLUSTER MODEL\n\n2.3.1\n\nGravitational collapse\n\nThe virial radius, rvir , is used to define the size of a cluster. This can be calculated by\nusing the spherical infall model (Gunn & Gott 1972), which gives\nrvir\n\n3Mvir\n=\n4\u03c0\u2206c (z)\u03c1crit (z)\n\n!1/3\n,\n\n(2.23)\n\nwhere Mvir is the virial mass of the cluster, \u03c1crit (z) = 3H 2 (z)/ (8\u03c0G) is the critical density for the Universe to be flat and H(z) is the Hubble parameter, given by the Friedmann equation, Equation 2.12, for a flat universe (which we will assume throughout).\nThe quantity \u2206c is the mean matter density within the virial radius of the cluster in\nunits of the critical density,\n\u2206c (z) =\n\n\u03c1cluster (z)\n.\n\u03c1crit (z)\n\n(2.24)\n\nThe value for \u2206c depends on the cosmological parameters; in an Einstein-de Sitter\nuniverse it is exactly 18\u03c02 \u2248 178. For our adopted cosmology, we use the fit given by\nBryan & Norman (1998),\n\u2206c = 18\u03c02 + 82(\u03a9m (z) \u2212 1) \u2212 39(\u03a9m (z) \u2212 1)2 ,\n\n(2.25)\n\nwhere \u03a9m (z) = \u03a9m (1 + z)3 /E 2 (z) is the matter density at redshift z.\nThe radius at which the cluster has an overdensity of 200 can also be calculated,\nvia\n3M200\nr200 (z) =\n4\u03c0200\u03c1crit (z)\n\n!1/3\n,\n\n(2.26)\n\nand similarly for other overdensity values.\nFinally, the cluster radius needs to be converted to an angular size so that the cluster\ncan be projected on to a virtual sky map. This is done by dividing the virial radius by\nthe angular diameter distance, \u03b8vir = rvir /dA (z) in which\nRz\nc 0 H \u22121 (z0 )dz0\ndA (z) =\n.\n(1 + z)\n\n(2.27)\n\n55\n\n\f2: CREATING A VIRTUAL SKY\n\n2.3.2\n\nDark matter\n\nWe calculate the surface mass density of each galaxy cluster for the purpose of distributing point sources on to the map (see Section 2.6). For the dark matter density\nprofile, we use the Navarro, Frenk and White (NFW) profile,\n!\nr\n\u03c1crit \u2206c\n\u03c1DM\n= \u0010\n\u0011 .\nrs\nr\nr 2\n1 + rs\nrs\n\n(2.28)\n\nThis was found by fitting profiles to dark matter haloes from N-body/hydrodynamical\nsimulations run by Navarro et al. (1995, 1996, 1997), and is now the standard profile\nfor modeling dark matter haloes. The scale radius for the NFW profile is rs = rvir /cDM ,\nwhere cDM is the concentration parameter. Values for the concentration parameter\ndepend weakly on the cluster mass with a certain amount of scatter (see for example\nNeto et al. 2007; Duffy et al. 2008). However, as we are only using the surface mass\ndensity maps indirectly these effects are unimportant here, so we assume a constant\nvalue, cDM = 5, which is appropriate for clusters.\nThe surface mass density at distance \u03c6 s = \u03b8/\u03b8s from the centre of the cluster, where\n\u03b8s = rs /dA and \u03b8 is the angular distance from any given position in the sky to the centre\nof the cluster, is given by\n\u03a3(\u03c6 s ) = \u03a30 \u03b6DM (\u03c6 s ).\n\n(2.29)\n\nIn this, the central surface mass density of a cluster can be calculated using (see for\nexample \u00c5okas & Mamon 2001)\n\u03a30 =\n\n2\u03c0r2s (ln(1\n\nMvir\n,\n+ c) \u2212 (c/(1 + c)))\n\n(2.30)\n\nand the NFW profile can be projected on to a 2D sky to give (Bartelmann 1996)\n\uf8f1\n\u0012q\n\u0013\n\uf8f4\n\u03c6 s \u22121\n2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n1 \u2212 \u221a 2 arctan\n\u03c6 s > 1,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u03c6 s +1\n\uf8f4\n\u03c6 s \u22121\n\uf8f4\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\uf8f4\nq\n\uf8f4\n2 \uf8f2\n1\u2212\u03c6 s\n\u03b6DM = 2\n(2.31)\n1 \u2212 \u221a 2 2 arctan\n\u03c6 s < 1,\n\uf8f4\n1+\u03c6 s\n\uf8f4\n\u03c6s \u2212 1 \uf8f4\n1\u2212\u03c6\n\uf8f4\ns\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n1\n\u03c6 s = 1.\n\n56\n\n\f2.3: GALAXY CLUSTER MODEL\n\n2.3.3\n\nSZ effect\n\nOur gas model consists of two parts: a profile, and a normalization for the level of the\nSZ effect, which is dependent on the mass and redshift of the cluster. The method is\nanalogous to that used for creating maps of the dark matter distribution.\nWe use the isothermal \u03b2-model (Cavaliere & Fusco-Femiano 1976) for the cluster\nprofile,\n\u03begas\n\n!\u2212 3\u03b2\n!\nr\nr2 2\n,\n= 1+ 2\nrc\nrc\n\n(2.32)\n\nin which \u03b2 is a dimensionless parameter that measures the outer slope of the profile,\nrc = rvir /cgas is the core radius that describes the turn-over point between the core\nand the power-law slope. The concentration of the SZ effect around the cluster centre\nis controlled by cgas . Fiducial values of cgas = 10 and \u03b2 = 2/3 are used, following\nBattye & Weller (2003). We truncate the profile at the virial radius, rvir , which prevents\npotential divergence in the gas mass (see for example Birkinshaw 1999). This may\nhowever underestimate the total SZ effect from an individual cluster, where infalling\ngas is shocked outside of the virial radius and prevented from falling inwards (see for\nexample Evrard 1990; Kocsis et al. 2005).\nThe change in the temperature of the CMB from the SZ effect can be calculated\nusing\n\u2206T (\u03c6c ) = y(\u03c6c )g(x)T CMB\n\n(2.33)\n\nwhere g(x) = (x/ tanh(x/2)) \u2212 4, the dimensionless frequency x = hP \u03bd/kB T CMB , kB is\nBoltzmann's constant, hP is Planck's constant and \u03bd is the frequency of interest. The\npresent-day temperature of the CMB as measured by the FIRAS instrument on COBE\nis T CMB = 2.728K (Fixsen et al. 1996). The SZ effect along the line of sight from a\nsingle cluster depends on the integrated SZ effect from the cluster, Y(M, z), and the\ncluster profile \u03b6(\u03c6c ) as\ny(\u03c6c ) =\n\nY\u03b6(\u03c6c )\nR \u03c6vir\n2\u03c0 0 \u03b6(\u03c60c )\u03c60c d\u03c60c\n\n(2.34)\n\nwhere \u03c6c = \u03b8/\u03b8c is the distance from the centre of the cluster in units of \u03b8c = rc /dA .\n\n57\n\n\f2: CREATING A VIRTUAL SKY\n\nThe integrated Y parameter is a measure of the total power of the SZ effect and is\nused as the normalization of our cluster profile. It is directly related to the total thermal\nenergy of the gas. We assume a power-law relation between Y and the cluster mass,\nY\u2217 h\u22121\nMvir\nY= 2\n14\ndA (z) 10 h\u22121 M\n\n!\u03b3\n\n!1/3\n\u2206c (z) 2\n(1 + z)\u03b1 ,\nE (z)\n\u2206c (0)\n\n(2.35)\n\nwhere Y\u2217 , \u03b3 and \u03b1 fix the normalisation, slope and redshift evolution respectively. For\nour fiducial values we adopt Y\u2217 = 2 \u00d7 10\u22126 Mpc2 ; the isothermal value of \u03b3 = 5/3 and\n\u03b1 = 0 such that the clusters are approximately self-similar. These choices are motivated by the results from recent cosmological simulations, which demonstrate that the\nrelationship between Y and M is a power-law with small intrinsic scatter, being close to\nthat predicted by the self-similar model at all redshifts, and relatively insensitive to the\neffects of cooling and heating of the intracluster medium (see, for example, da Silva\net al. 2004; Motl et al. 2005; Nagai 2006).\nUsing the recent Millennium Gas simulations, Kay et al. (in prep.) obtain bestfitting values of Y\u2217 = 2.3 \u00d7 10\u22126 Mpc2 and \u03b3 = 1.64 for a non-radiative simulation\nat z = 0, and Y\u2217 = 1.9 \u00d7 10\u22126 Mpc2 and \u03b3 = 1.76 for a simulation where the gas\nwas preheated and allowed to cool radiatively. Both fits were applied to clusters with\nMvir > 1014 h\u22121 M , the objects that dominate the power spectrum over the range of\nmultipoles of interest in this paper. These values agree well with the fiducial values\nabove.\nFinally, the \u03b2 profile can be projected from three dimensions to a 2D sky to become\n(Battye & Weller 2003)\n\"\u0012\n\u0010\n\u0011 1 3\u03b2 J\n2 2\u2212 2\n\u03b6SZ (\u03c6c ) = 1 + \u03c6c\n\nc2 \u2212\u03c62c\n1+\u03c62c\n\n\u00131/2\n\nJ[c, \u03b2]\n\n#\n,\u03b2\n,\n\n(2.36)\n\nwhere\nZ a\u0010\n\u0011\u2212 3b\nJ[a, b] =\n1 + x2 2 dx.\n0\n\n58\n\n(2.37)\n\n\f2.4: EXAMPLE REALIZATIONS AND POWER SPECTRA\n\nFigure 2.7: A realization from the \u03c38 = 0.825 cosmology using a clustered Pinocchio\nlightcone with mass corrections. The maps are 1\u25e6 \u00d7 1\u25e6 , with a resolution of 6 arcseconds. From left to right the maps are of the temperature decrement from the SZ effect,\nthe CMB and the two combined. White represents colder areas, with black representing hotter areas. The colours range from 0 to -200 \u03bcK for the first image and 200 to\n-200 \u03bcK for the other two.\n\n2.4\n\nExample realizations and power spectra\n\nFigure 2.7 shows 1\u25e6 \u00d7 1\u25e6 maps of the SZ effect and the CMB separately and combined\nfor a single realization from the \u03c38 = 0.825 cosmology, using the Pinocchio simulations. In the SZ map, an Mvir = 5.4\u00d71014 M galaxy cluster at a redshift of z = 0.13 lies\nin the top right, with a virial radius of 14 arcmin. The SZ map contains 1933 galaxy\ngroups and clusters in total, with a maximum decrement in a single pixel of 450\u03bcK\nand an average of 8.5\u03bcK per pixel across the map.\nFor the 3\u25e6 \u00d7 3\u25e6 realizations with \u03c38 = 0.75 and a resolution of 18 arcseconds,\nthere are 13 470 \u00b1 300 galaxy groups and clusters per realization, where the standard\ndeviation is from the scatter between the realizations. These objects cause an average\ndecrement per pixel of 4.3 \u00b1 0.5\u03bcK in each map (again with a standard deviation from\nthe scatter). For \u03c38 = 0.825 this increases to 18 040 \u00b1 350 galaxy groups and clusters\nand an average of 6.5 \u00b1 1.3\u03bcK, and for \u03c38 = 0.9 this further increases to 23 000\u00b1400\ngalaxy groups and clusters and an average of 9.3\u00b11.3\u03bcK. The increase in the number of\nobjects, and hence the total amount of power from the SZ effect, is due to the increase\nin the clustering of matter as \u03c38 increases.\nTo confirm that the power spectra calculated from these realizations are converged\n\n59\n\n\f50\n\n50\n\n45\n\n45\n\n40\n\n40\nl (l+1) Cl / (2 \u03c0) [\u03bcK2]\n\nl (l+1) Cl / (2 \u03c0) [\u03bcK2]\n\n2: CREATING A VIRTUAL SKY\n\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n\n10\n\n10\n\n5\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000 10000\n\n0\n\n1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000 10000\n\nl\n\nl\n\nFigure 2.8: Left panel: The mean power spectra from the SZ effect in the \u03c38 = 0.825\ncosmology imposing various minimum mass limits: from the bottom up, 1 \u00d7 1015 ,\n5 \u00d7 1014 , 2 \u00d7 1014 , 1 \u00d7 1014 , 5 \u00d7 1013 , 2 \u00d7 1013 and 1 \u00d7 1013 M . Right panel: The same,\nbut imposing a maximum redshift cutoff of (from the bottom up) z = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5,\n2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0 and 4.5. These results show that the spectrum is approximately\nconverged for M > 1013 M and z < 3.5.\nsuch that no significant amount of power comes from clusters with lower masses or\nhigher redshifts, the mean spectra from realizations with various minimum mass and\nmaximum redshift cutoffs imposed are shown in Figure 2.8 for \u03c38 = 0.825. The\nspectra are converged to within a few \u03bcK2 over the multipole range of interest when\nclusters down to 1013 M and out to a redshift z = 3.5 are included (the effects of\nreducing the maximum mass cutoff will be discussed in Section 3.5). We use 1013 M\nand z = 4.5 as the fiducial limits for the realizations shown in the rest of this paper.\nAlthough the average SZ effect across the map is converged by the same redshift, it is\nnot converged at a minimum mass of 1013 M ; lower mass objects than considered here\nwill significantly contribute towards the average SZ effect.\nAs an additional check, we compare the ratio of the mean power spectra between\nrealizations with different values of \u03c38 . Komatsu & Seljak (2002) found that Cl scales\nas \u03c3\u03b18 , where \u03b1 \u2248 7. Fitting for \u03b1 for our realizations and averaging over the multipole\nbins, we find that between the \u03c38 = 0.75 and 0.825 realizations, \u03b1 \u2248 7.1. Between\n\u03c38 = 0.90 and 0.825 the value is \u03b1 \u2248 6.9. Thus there is fairly good agreement, although\nthe relationship appears not to be a perfect power law over this range of \u03c38 .\n\n60\n\n\f2.5: THEORETICAL POWER SPECTRA\n\n2.5\n\nTheoretical power spectra\n\nRather than calculating the mean power spectrum from maps of the SZ effect, it can be\nevaluated directly from the number density and cluster profile using the halo formalism\n(see for example Cooray 2001; Komatsu & Seljak 2002) under the assumption that the\nclusters are Poisson distributed. The mean binned spectra can be calculated by\nZ\nZ\n1 X l(l + 1) zmax Mmax dV dn 2\nBi =\ny dMdz,\n(2.38)\nN l\u2208bin 2\u03c0\ndz dM l\nzmin\nMmin\nwhere i is the bin number and the sum is over the multipoles l in the bin.\n\u0010R z\n\u00112\n3\n0\n0\nc\nE(z\n)dz\ndV(z)\n0\n=\ndz\nE(z)H03\n\n(2.39)\n\nis the comoving volume of the Universe at a given redshift, where E(z) is as in Equation\n2.12 and dn/dM is the comoving cluster number density. The parameter yl is the value\nof the Fourier transform of the cluster model at the multipole l, given by\nZ \u03c6vir\nyl (M, z) = 2\u03c0g(x)\n\u03c6c y(\u03c6c )J0 ((l + 0.5)\u03c6c ) d\u03c6c ,\n\n(2.40)\n\n0\n\nwhere g(x) determines the frequency dependence of the SZ effect, as per Equation\n2.33, y(\u03c6c ) is from Equation 2.34 and J0 is zeroth-order cylindrical Bessel function.\nUsing the covariance matrix, the standard deviation can also be calculated in a similar way. Here, the angular trispectrum T ll0 is used, defined by (Cooray 2001; Komatsu\n& Seljak 2002)\nT ll0 =\n\nZ\n\nzmax\n\nZ\n\nzmin\n\nMmax\nMmin\n\ndV dn 2 2\ny y 0 dMdz.\ndz dM l l\n\n(2.41)\n\nThis is then combined with the expected Gaussian cosmic variance from the mean\nspectrum to calculate the covariance matrix Mll0 via\nMll0 =\n\n1\nfsky\n\n!\n2ClCl0\nT ll0\n\u03b4ll0 +\n,\n(2l + 1)\u2206l\n4\u03c0\n\n(2.42)\n\nwhere \u2206l is the width of the multipole bin and fsky is the fraction of the sky being\nconsidered. The standard deviation can then be calculated from the diagonal of the co\u221a\nvariance matrix, that is, \u03c3l = l(l + 1) Mll /2\u03c0.

The higher values of the pairs are from the theoretical spectrum, the lower from the\nrealizations; there is consistency between the shapes of the curves and the analytical\nformula is 2 \u2212 4 per cent higher than the realizations.\nand Poissonian terms. Note that Zhang & Sheth (2007) add an additional component\nto the calculation of the variance to model the clustering of galaxy clusters but find\nthat the Poissonian term dominates over the clustering term; for this reason we do not\nconsider it here.\nFigure 2.9 compares the values computed using this method with those from the\nrealizations for the three different cosmologies. The analytical method predicts \u223c 2 \u2212 4\nper cent more power than the realizations, which is likely due to inefficiencies in the\ncreation of the maps, but it appears that there is broad consistency here.\n\n2.6\n\nPoint sources at microwave frequencies\n\nForeground emission from extragalactic point sources will contaminate the map. Synchrotron is the dominant process at frequencies below around 90 GHz, with emission\nfrom dust becoming important at higher frequencies. Although these sources are physically extended, this is generally much smaller than the beam size of the telescopes\n\n62\n\n\f2.6: POINT SOURCES AT MICROWAVE FREQUENCIES\n\nused to measure the CMB and SZ effect, so that they are well approximated as point\nsources.\nWe calculate the total number of point sources with a flux density between S min\nand S max within an area \u2206\u03a9 on the sky by\nZ\nNtot = \u2206\u03a9\n\nS max\nS min\n\ndN\ndS \u03bd ,\ndS \u03bd\n\n(2.43)\n\nwhere dN/dS \u03bd is the differential source counts as a function of flux density. To calculate the flux densities of individual sources, we randomly sample from a probability\ndistribution defined by a normalized dN/dS \u03bd between the flux density limits.\nThe flux densities can be converted to the thermodynamic temperatures at a given\nfrequency \u03bd using\nT\u03bd = S \u03bd/\n\ndB\n2\n\u03b8pixel\n\n!\n\ndT\n\n,\n\n(2.44)\n\n2\nwhere \u03b8pixel\nis the area of the pixel containing the point source and\n\ndB 2k kT CMB\n= 2\ndT\nc\nh\n\n!2\n\nx4 e x\n,\n(e x \u2212 1)2\n\n(2.45)\n\nis the differential of the Planck function with respect to temperature, where x is the\ndimensionless frequency, given by x = hP \u03bd/kB T CMB .\nThe theoretical power spectrum expected from the point sources can be calculated\nby (White & Majumdar 2004)\ndB\nCl =\ndT\n\n!\u22122 Z\n\nS max\n\nS \u03bd2 (dN/dS \u03bd )dS \u03bd ,\n\n(2.46)\n\nS min\n\nwhere S \u03bd is the flux of the point source at frequency \u03bd.\n\n2.6.1\n\nLow frequency point sources\n\nThe majority of surveys for radio sources have been done at low frequencies; there are\nmany less at high frequencies (i.e. the GHz range) as sensitive telescopes have a much\nsmaller field of view at these frequencies, meaning that the surveys take much longer.\n\n63\n\n\f2: CREATING A VIRTUAL SKY\n\nS(5/2) x dN/dS (/mJy/degree2)\n\n1000\n\n100\n\n10\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n10000\n\nFlux (mJy)\n\nFigure 2.10: Comparison of the 30 GHz differential source counts from Toffolatti et al.\n(1998) rescaled by a factor of 0.7 (black dotted line) with the 1\u03c3 ranges from measurements by (right-to-left) WMAP Ka band (Bennett et al. 2003, pink), DASI (Kovac\net al. 2002, blue), VSA (Cleary et al. 2005, green), CBI (Mason et al. 2003, red) and\nGBT (Mason et al. 2009, black)\nThe most common way of parameterising the dN/dS of radio sources is by using\na single power law of the form\nN0 S \u03bd\ndN\n=\ndS \u03bd S 0 S 0\n\n!\u2212\u03b1\n.\n\n(2.47)\n\nCleary et al.

(1998, henceforth\nT98). This is an extrapolation of the observed number counts at 1.4 GHz, which have\nbeen measured to much lower flux densities than the number counts at the frequencies\nof interest here. We have normalized the model by a factor of 0.7 (following Cleary\net al. 2005) to bring it into closer agreement with measurements of the number count at\n30 GHz (see Figure 2.10). Although this still results in an over-prediction of the number of sources around 1 mJy compared with recent observations using the Green Bank\nTelescope (Mason et al. 2009), we note that Muchovej et al. (2009) find a higher number of sources than T98 using the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Array at the same flux density\nlevel.\n\n64\n\n\f2.6: POINT SOURCES AT MICROWAVE FREQUENCIES\n\nWe use S \u03bd /S 30 GHz = (\u03bd/30 GHz)\u03b1 to scale the flux densities to the desired frequency \u03bd. The spectral index \u03b1 is determined for each source using a Gaussian distribution about a mean \u03b1 = \u22120.3, with \u03c3\u03b1 = 0.36, for each source, which is the\ndistribution for 15 to 30 GHz measured for the 9C sample (Cleary, private communication). We include point sources with flux densities between 10\u22124.5 and 105 mJy at\n30 GHz; sources above this flux density range are very rare. Sources with weaker flux\ndensities are not well characterized and should have a negligible contribution to the\npower spectra.\n\n2.6.2\n\nHigh frequency point sources\n\nAlthough negligible at the fiducial frequency of 30 GHz, dusty galaxies become important at higher frequencies. For these, we use the fit to SCUBA observations provided\nby Borys et al. (2003). This is in the form of a double power law,\ndN\nN0\n=\ndS \u03bd S 0\n\n\uf8ee\n!\n!\u03b2 \uf8f9\u22121\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef S \u03b1\nS \uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\uf8f0\n\uf8fa\uf8fb ,\n+\nS0\nS0\n\n(2.48)\n\nwhere the parameters at 350 GHz are S 0 = 1.8mJy, \u03b1 = 1.0, \u03b2 = 3.3 and N0 =\n1.5\u00d7104 deg\u22122 . This is extrapolated to other frequencies using S \u03bd = \u03bd\u03b3 , where \u03b3 = 2.5.\nWe use the flux range 101 to 105 mJy at 350 GHz.\n\n2.6.3\n\nSpatial distribution\n\nIn addition to the total number of point sources and their flux densities, we need positions. The simplest method is to distribute them randomly over the map, so that the\nprobability of finding a source at a particular position, P(x, y), is constant across the\nmap. However, galaxies emitting synchrotron radiation are thought to reside preferentially within galaxy clusters. Observations at 30 GHz by Coble et al. (2007) suggest\nthat the number counts of these sources increase in the direction of known massive\nclusters; Lin & Mohr (2007) come to a similar conclusion at 1.4 GHz. To account\nfor this, we correlate the positions of these sources with the galaxy clusters by using\n\n65\n\n\f2: CREATING A VIRTUAL SKY\n\nFigure 2.11: Point source contamination of a 1015 h\u22121 M cluster from Kay et al.

In particular we use the\nprobability distribution\nP(x, y) = R\n\n\u03a3(x, y)1/3\n\u03a3(x0 , y0 )1/3 dx0 dy0\n\n.\n\n(2.49)\n\nThe specific choice of \u03a3(x, y)1/3 brings the number counts towards clusters into reasonable agreement with those estimated by Coble et al. (2007).\nAs the radio point sources are thought to reside in galaxies within clusters, these are\ndistributed according to the surface density, and their number is enriched by a factor\nof 3 when a single cluster is being mapped. Infrared sources, however, are at high\nredshift, and any clustering present in their distribution will be unrelated to the galaxy\ncluster. Thus, they are not enriched and are randomly distributed.\nFigure 2.11 shows the effect of point sources on the SZ effect from a simulated\nlarge, nearby cluster over a range of frequencies between 10 and 350 GHz, and at\nresolutions of 12 arcsec, 1 and 10 arcmin. The radio point sources are enriched towards\nthe centre of the cluster, depending on the surface matter density. Infrared point sources\nare also included, but are randomly distributed. With a beam of 10 arcmin, the cluster\ncan be detected at 90 GHz and above, however it is heavily point source confused.\nWith a one arcmin beam, the cluster can be seen at 30 GHz and above, but point\nsource contamination is obvious. At 12 arcsec resolution, individual features within\nthe cluster can start to be resolved, however individual point sources are obvious at\nall frequencies. The large number of infrared point sources is obvious at 350 GHz,\nrequiring high resolution to distinguish between point sources and extended emission\nfrom the SZ effect.\n\n2.6.4\n\nPolarization\n\nThe polarization of point sources is of great interest for instruments that aim to observe\nthe B-mode polarization within the CMB. Jackson et al. (2009) have observed a set of\nWMAP point sources using the VLA at a range of frequencies, and have measured the\npercentage of their flux density that is polarized. Battye et al. (in prep.) have analysed\n\n67\n\n\f2: CREATING A VIRTUAL SKY\n\nthe statistical properties of the sources using the results of these observations. As part\nof this, the model described above was used to predict the expected polarized point\nsource power spectra for a variety of both total intensity and polarized flux density\ncuts. The component of this work that the Author was involved in is described here.\nEquation 2.46 can be modified to provide the polarized point source power spectrum up to a flux density cut in total intensity, yielding\n!\u22122\nZ\ndB D 2 E S max 2\nP\nCl =\n\u03a0\nS \u03bd (dN/dS \u03bd )dS \u03bd ,\ndT\nS min\n\n(2.50)\n\nwhere\nD E Z 1\n\u03a02 =\nd\u03a0\u03a02 P(\u03a0).\n\n(2.51)\n\n0\n\nWe model the observed histogram of polarization percentages as a log-normal distribution,\n!\n[ln(\u03a0/\u03a00 )]2\nA\n.\nP(\u03a0) = exp \u2212\n\u03a0\n2\u03c32\n\n(2.52)\n\nThe values for the median \u03a00 and the standard deviation \u03c3 can be found from the\nobservations by two different ways. Only considering the point sources where polarization has been detected yields values of 100\u03a00 = 2.5 and \u03c3 = 0.67, however this\ndistribution is biased towards point sources with high polarization percentages. Taking\nthe undetected point sources into account yields 100\u03a00 = 2.25 and \u03c3 = 0.74; This\ngives a mean of 100h\u03a0i = 2.95 and an RMS of 100h\u03a02 i1/2 = 3.9, which is comparable with the observations. We adopt these values for the remainder of this section.\nThe function for both parameter sets and the binned observation results are plotted in\nFigure 2.12; there is good agreement between the two.\nAs per Section 2.6.1, the model of Toffolatti et al. (1998) at 30 GHz, rescaled by\na factor of 0.7, is used for the number of point sources with given flux densities.

There\nis no dramatic change in the number of sources over this range of frequencies.\n\n69\n\n\f2: CREATING A VIRTUAL SKY\n\nHere, \u1fb1 = \u22120.44 is the mean spectral index, with a scatter of \u03c3\u03b1 = 0.47, as measured\nbetween 22 and 43 GHz by Battye et al. (in prep.), and \u03c7(S ) = \u2212d(log n)/d(log S ) is\nthe power law slope of the source count. The number of point sources above a given\nflux density per square degree is shown in Figure 2.13 for a range of frequencies between 30 and 220 GHz. Due to the presence of flat spectrum sources, there is not a\nsignificant change in the number of point sources with a given flux density over the\nrange of frequencies considered here. However, we caution that the observations were\nmade at frequencies up to 43 GHz, so extrapolation to 220 GHz will not provide the\nmost accurate results. We have also not taken into account the steepening of the spectral index distribution observed both in this sample and others (e.g. Ricci et al. 2006;\nMassardi et al. 2008), which will have led to an overestimate in these simulations.\nHence the results should be considered to be an upper limit at the highest frequencies.\nInfrared sources are expected to have a polarization percentage of around 1 per\ncent, based on observations of Arp 220 that find an upper limit of 1.5 per cent (Seiffert\net al. 2007). At the frequencies of interest here, the polarized emission of infrared\npoint sources is subdominant to that from the radio point sources, and hence it does\nnot contribute significantly to the power spectra. As a result, we do not include infrared\nsources in these calculations.\nAssuming that the polarized power is evenly distributed between E and B modes,\nClBB = ClP /2, we calculate the power spectra expected from point sources according to\nEquation 2.50. These are plotted in Figure 2.14 for 30, 44, 70, 100, 150 and 220 GHz\nfor point source flux density cuts of 1 Jy, 100 mJy and 10 mJy. We also show the expected B-mode polarization spectra for tensor-to-scalar ratios r = 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001,\nand for comparison we also plot the E-mode power spectrum. For observations at\nfrequencies lower than 100 GHz, point source subtraction will be necessary to reach\nr = 0.1. Point source subtraction will be necessary to measure r = 0.01 at all frequencies considered here.\nFigure 2.15 shows the level of the power spectrum due to the point sources as a\nfunction of S cut for a range of frequencies. It also shows the level of the maximum\n\n70\n\n\f2.6: POINT SOURCES AT MICROWAVE FREQUENCIES\n\n100\n\n100\n\n44 GHz\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1\n\n1\n\nl (l+1) ClBB / (2 \u03c0) [\u03bcK2]\n\nl (l+1) ClBB / (2 \u03c0) [\u03bcK2]\n\n30 GHz\n\n0.1\n0.01\n0.001\n0.0001\n1e-05\n\n0.1\n0.01\n0.001\n0.0001\n1e-05\n\n1e-06\n\n1e-06\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n10\n\nl\n\n100\n\n100\n10\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.1\n0.01\n0.001\n0.0001\n1e-05\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n0.1\n0.01\n0.001\n0.0001\n1e-05\n\n1e-06\n\n1e-06\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n10\n\nl\n\n100\n\nl\n\n100\n\n150 GHz\n\n220 GHz\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1\n\n1\n\nl (l+1) ClBB / (2 \u03c0) [\u03bcK2]\n\nl (l+1) ClBB / (2 \u03c0) [\u03bcK2]\n\n1000\n\n100 GHz\n\n10\nl (l+1) ClBB / (2 \u03c0) [\u03bcK2]\n\nl (l+1) ClBB / (2 \u03c0) [\u03bcK2]\n\n70 GHz\n\n100\nl\n\n0.1\n0.01\n0.001\n0.0001\n1e-05\n\n0.1\n0.01\n0.001\n0.0001\n1e-05\n\n1e-06\n\n1e-06\n10\n\n100\nl\n\n1000\n\n10\nl\n\nFigure 2.14: Polarized point source spectra for a range of frequencies and flux density\ncuts.

It has described the process of creating\nsimulated cluster catalogues \u2013 by analytical formulae, N-body simulations and using\nPinocchio simulations \u2013 and the application of a galaxy cluster model to turn these\ncatalogues into maps of the SZ effect. Example realisations, and power spectra of the\nSZ effect, were covered, and were also compared with theoretical power spectra.\nThe process of adding point sources \u2013 both low- and high-frequency \u2013 to the maps\nwas then covered, including distributing the point sources according to the surface\nmatter density of the galaxy clusters. The polarization of point sources was also discussed, looking at the effect of these point sources on observations of B-mode power\nspectra in the polarization of the CMB. These results show that point source subtraction will be necessary in order to measure the B-mode power spectra, particularly if\nthe tensor-to-scalar ratio is small (< 0.1).\nWith the model established, the next chapter will look at the scientific uses for these\nmaps, focusing on the statistics of the SZ effect.\n\n73\n\n\f2: CREATING A VIRTUAL SKY\n\n74\n\n\f3\nStatistics of the SZ power spectrum\nThe discovery of the CMB by Penzias & Wilson (1965) helped provide the foundations\nof modern cosmology. The discovery of the primordial anisotropies on large scales by\nCOBE (Smoot et al. 1992), followed by the precision measurements by the Wilkinson\nMicrowave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP; see for example Hinshaw et al. 2009) and other\nexperiments, pinned down the values of the principle cosmological parameters. With\nthe forthcoming measurements by the Planck satellite, the primordial anisotropies at\nlarge scales will be measured as accurately as possible (Planck Consortium 2005),\nwith cosmic variance preventing any more precise measurements of the cosmological\nparameters from these anisotropies. Interest is now turning towards measurements of\nthe primordial polarization and the total power on smaller scales.\nAt these smaller scales, \"secondary\" anisotropies start to dominate over the primordial signal. A significant component of this secondary anisotropy will be caused\nby the SZ effect, which is expected to be dominated by groups and clusters of galaxies\ndue to the high temperatures of the intracluster medium. At microwave frequencies\n(\u223c 30 GHz) the SZ effect will contaminate the power spectrum due to the primary\nCMB anisotropies at spherical multipoles of l \u223c 1000 and above, making it difficult\nto extract cosmological information from the primary anisotropies at these scales; by\nl \u223c 2000 it is expected that it will dominate the power spectrum.\nSeveral experiments have measured the power spectrum in this region of multi-\n\n75\n\n\f3: STATISTICS OF THE SZ POWER SPECTRUM\n\npoles, and some of these show hints of excess power over what would be expected\nfrom the primary anisotropies alone. The Cosmic Background Imager (CBI; Mason\net al. 2003; Readhead et al. 2004; Sievers et al. 2009), which observed multipoles up\nto l = 4000 at 30 GHz, was the first to measure a possible excess, and this has been confirmed by subsequent analysis. This was followed by the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland\nAssociation (BIMA) interferometer (Dawson et al. 2006) observing around l = 5000\nat 28.5 GHz, and at higher frequencies by the Arcminute Cosmology Bolometer Array\nReceiver (ACBAR), which has weakly detected a possible excess at around l = 2500\nat 150 GHz (Reichardt et al. 2008). Curiously, observations at similar multipoles by\nthe Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Array at 30 GHz (SZA; Sharp et al. 2009) and QUaD at 100\nand 150 GHz (Friedman et al. 2009) do not show any excess power.\nThe amount of signal from the SZ effect depends on the amplitude of the power\nspectrum of the density fluctuations in the Universe. This power spectrum is normalized by \u03c38 , which is the variance of the fluctuations on scales of 8h\u22121 Mpc. To explain\nthe excess measured by the CBI, Sievers et al. (2009) find that \u03c38 must be between\n0.9 and 1.0. However, observations of the primordial CMB anisotropies by WMAP in\ncombination with other instruments and methods yield \u03c38 = 0.812 \u00b1 0.026 (Komatsu\net al. 2009).\nAn important issue to consider when estimating the range of possible values of \u03c38\nthat agree with the data is the statistical properties of the SZ effect, which will be nonGaussian. Here we investigate those properties to see whether the excess could be the\nresult of measuring part of the sky where the power from the SZ effect is higher than\naverage, which would bias the measurement of \u03c38 to higher than the average value. To\ndo this, we use 3\u25e6 \u00d7 3\u25e6 sky maps with a resolution of 18 arcseconds (600 pixels to a\nside), which allow us to accurately probe the multipole range l = 1000 \u2212 10 000.\nUsing the virtual sky maps described in Section 2, the binned power spectra from\nthe SZ effect are calculated using bins of \u2206l = 1000. We analyse the histograms\nof these power spectra and investigate the normalized skew as well as the mean and\nstandard deviation. Higher orders than the skewness, such as the kurtosis, tend to be\n\n76\n\n\f3.1: FIDUCIAL RESULTS\n\nl = 1000-2000\n\nl = 2000-3000\n\nl = 3000-4000\n\nl = 4000-5000\n\n0.01\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n0.01\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n\n0.001\n\n0.001\n\n0.001\n\n0.0001\n\n0.0001\n\n0.0001\n\n550 600 650 700 750 800 850 900\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\nl = 5000-6000\n\n180\n\n200\n\n0.0001\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nl = 6000-7000\n\n70\n\n80\n\n30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75\n\nl = 7000-8000\n\nl = 8000-9000\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n0.01\n\n0.01\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n\n0.001\n\n0.001\n\n0.001\n\n0.0001\n\n0.0001\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n0.0001\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n0.0001\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\nFigure 3.1: The statistics of the combined CMB and SZ effect power spectra at 30 GHz\nfor the \u03c38 = 0.825 cosmology for a thousand 3\u25e6 \u00d7 3\u25e6 maps.

The computed values for all three values of \u03c38 , for both the power spectrum of\nthe SZ effect on its own and that from the combined CMB and SZ effect, are given in\nTable 3.1.\nThe SZ effect significantly increases the standard deviation of the realization statistics for all but the lowest multipoles. This is shown graphically in Figure 3.2, where\nthe ratio of the standard deviation to the mean is given for the CMB and SZ effects\nseparately, and then combined. The SZ effect has a much higher ratio than for the\nCMB on its own. When combined with the CMB, the realizations have a low standard\ndeviation at the lowest multipoles, where the CMB is dominant, but quickly return to\nhigher values at the higher multipoles where the CMB has decreased in power due to\nSilk damping and the SZ effect is closer to its peak power. The point at which the transition occurs is slightly different for the three values of \u03c38 ; this is due to the different\npower levels from the SZ effect, with the \u03c38 = 0.9 cosmology having more power and\n\n78\n\n\fB\u0304i\n16\n20\n22\n23\n23\n22\n21\n20\n19\n710\n130\n36\n25\n23\n22\n22\n21\n19\n\nB\u0304i\n31\n40\n44\n45\n45\n44\n42\n40\n38\n720\n150\n58\n47\n45\n44\n42\n40\n38\n\n\u03c38\n\u03b4Bi\n12\n9.3\n7.5\n6.0\n5.0\n4.3\n3.7\n3.2\n2.8\n56\n13\n7.7\n6.1\n5.0\n4.3\n3.7\n3.2\n2.8\n\n= 0.825\nsi\n\u03b4Bi /\u03b4Bi,G\n1.8\n6.0\n0.94\n4.4\n0.72\n4.0\n0.65\n3.5\n0.49\n3.3\n0.50\n3.0\n0.40\n3.0\n0.40\n2.6\n0.41\n2.7\n0.40\n1.0\n0.59\n1.4\n0.70\n3.1\n0.68\n3.4\n0.50\n3.2\n0.49\n3.1\n0.40\n3.1\n0.39\n2.7\n0.41\n2.8\nB\u0304i\n58\n74\n81\n83\n82\n80\n77\n73\n70\n750\n180\n94\n85\n82\n80\n77\n74\n70\n\n\u03c38 = 0.9\n\u03b4Bi\nsi\n\u03b4Bi /\u03b4Bi,G\n23\n2.4\n6.3\n17\n1.0\n4.3\n14 0.72\n3.8\n11 0.56\n3.5\n9.1 0.52\n3.3\n7.7 0.41\n3.0\n6.6 0.46\n2.8\n5.7 0.36\n2.7\n4.9 0.33\n2.6\n62 0.26\n1.1\n19 0.60\n1.9\n14 0.72\n3.3\n11 0.55\n3.4\n9.1 0.51\n3.2\n7.7 0.40\n3.1\n6.6 0.46\n2.9\n5.7 0.36\n2.6\n4.9 0.33\n2.7\n\nTable 3.1: The statistics of the SZ effect (top section) and combined CMB and SZ effect (bottom section), generated using the 3\u25e6 \u00d73\u25e6\nclustered galaxy cluster catalogues from the modified Pinocchio simulations.

The CMB dominates to higher multipoles\nthan at 30 GHz., such that the broadening of the distributions due to the SZ effect is\nless important at intermediate multipoles.\nhence transitioning at lower multipoles.\nFigure 3.3 shows the equivalent histograms to Figure 3.1 but at 150 GHz. The\nSZ effect at this frequency is weaker by a factor of 2 than at 30 GHz, reducing the\npower spectrum by a factor of 4. As a result, the CMB dominates the power spectrum\nto higher multipoles and the increase in standard deviation due to the SZ effect does\nnot become important until l \u223c 4000. The highest multipoles considered here are\nnot greatly affected by this change in frequency as these remain dominated by the SZ\neffect.\nTo quantify more precisely this increase in standard deviation, we create realizations with the same mean power spectrum but Gaussianly distributing all of the power\nin the map, as if all of the power is due to the CMB. The Gaussian fit to these distributions is shown by the red solid lines in Figures 3.1 and 3.3. At the lowest multipoles,\nwhere the CMB is dominant, the statistics from this method are in good agreement with\nthose from the realizations. At higher multipoles, as expected, the standard deviation\nis much lower for Gaussian statistics than for the SZ effect. The ratios of the standard\ndeviation from the two methods are given in Table 3.1; the standard deviation is much\nsmaller, typically by a factor of 3 for l > 3000, when compared with the non-Gaussian\n\n80\n\n\f3.1: FIDUCIAL RESULTS\n\nrealizations.\nIn Section 2.4, the mean power spectra were found to scale approximately as\nCl \u221d \u03c3\u03b18 , where \u03b1 \u223c 7, as per Komatsu & Seljak (2002). Assuming that the standard deviation varies with \u03c38 in the same fashion, we find that \u03b1SD \u2248 6.0 between\n\u03c38 = 0.75 and 0.825, and \u2248 6.8 between 0.9 and 0.825. Thus, there is a strong dependence on \u03c38 for the standard deviation, although not quite as strong as for the mean\npower spectrum. The curve for \u03c38 = 0.75 is slightly higher than for the other two\nvalues of \u03c38 in Figure 3.2; this is an illustration of the non-universality of \u03b1SD .\nIn Section 2.5, the mean theoretical spectrum calculated by an analytical formula\nwas compared to the mean from the realizations and was found to agree well. The standard deviation can also be computed; see the Appendix for the method. The standard\ndeviation calculated solely from the Gaussian components differs from that calculated\nfrom the realizations by a factor between 3 and 7 depending on the multipole; when\nthe angular trispectrum component is added the two agree to within 20 per cent when\ncompared with the results from the Pinocchio realizations presented in Figure 3.2. The\norigin of the remaining discrepancy will be discussed in Section 3.4.\nWe find that the SZ effect results in a positive skew in the statistics, resulting from\nan overabundance of high-power realizations when compared with the expectations\nfrom Gaussian statistics due to the presence of rare, massive clusters and associated\nsmaller clusters. This is shown in Figure 3.4; the lowest multipoles for the SZ effect on\nits own are especially skewed. With the addition of the CMB, the low multipole bins\nbecome Gaussian as the CMB dominates, but some skewness remains at the higher\nmultipoles where the SZ effect is dominant. There is a certain amount of noise in the\nmeasurements of the skew here, however; an increased number of realizations would\nmeasure this more accurately. Zhang & Sheth (2007) have also found that the SZ effect\nyields a positively skewed distribution using an analytical approach for calculating the\nprobability distribution for a single multipole.\n\n81\n\n\f3: STATISTICS OF THE SZ POWER SPECTRUM\n\n3\n2.5\n\ns\n\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000 10000\nl\n\nFigure 3.4: The skewness s for the 3\u25e6 \u00d7 3\u25e6 maps for the three values of \u03c38 : 0.75 is\nshown by the blue dotted line, 0.825 by the red solid line and 0.9 by the black doubledotted line. The top set of lines are for the SZ only; the bottom set are when combined\nwith the CMB. There is little difference between the two above l \u223c 4000. At the\nlowest multipoles, the SZ effect significantly skews the distribution, and this skewness\nremains important at intermediate to high multipoles.\n\n3.2\n\nCorrelation matrix\n\nFor purely Gaussian maps, for example the CMB, the power on different scales is uncorrelated such that the off-diagonal terms of the covariance matrix are zero. However,\nthis may not be the case for the SZ effect. The covariance matrix can be calculated by\nCi j =\n\n1X n\n(B \u2212 B\u0304i )(Bnj \u2212 B\u0304 j ).\nN n i\n\n(3.2)\n\nThis is then normalized to give the correlation matrix by\nCi j\n.\n\u0108i j = p\nCiiC j j\n\n(3.3)\n\nThe correlation matrix is depicted graphically for the CMB and SZ effect individually and combined in Figure 3.5. The matrix is diagonal for the CMB, however the\noff-diagonal terms are significant for the SZ effect, in agreement with the predictions\nof Cooray (2001). This is due to the power from individual clusters spanning many\nthousands of multipoles, correlating the multipole bins considered here. This effect is\nreduced for widely separated multipole bins as individual clusters are not dominant at\n\n82\n\n\f3.3: DEPENDENCY ON MAP SIZE\n\n9\n\n9\n\n8\n\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\n7\n6\n5\n4\n\n9\n\n8\n\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\n7\n6\n5\n4\n\n8\n\n6\n5\n4\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\n7\n\n0\n\n9\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nFigure 3.5: The correlation matrix for 1000 realizations of the CMB (left), SZ effect\n(middle) and the combined CMB and SZ effect (right), using 3\u25e6 \u00d7 3\u25e6 maps with bins\nof \u2206l = 1000.

The first few multipole bins are\ndominated by the CMB, hence have a distribution that is close to Gaussian; the later\nbins become increasingly more skewed to higher values. Extremal values are more\nlikely than in the 3\u25e6 \u00d7 3\u25e6 maps.\nall multipoles; for example, as shown by Figure 2.8 the largest clusters only provide\nthe bulk of the SZ effect at the lowest multipoles, and smaller (mostly uncorrelated)\nclusters provide the power at the highest multipoles.\n\n83\n\n\f3: STATISTICS OF THE SZ POWER SPECTRUM\n\n3.3\n\nDependency on map size\n\nThe statistics of the SZ effect power spectrum will depend on the size of the map being\nconsidered. We investigate this dependency by considering maps of 1\u25e6 \u00d7 1\u25e6 and 2\u25e6 \u00d7 2\u25e6 ,\nin addition to the 3\u25e6 \u00d7 3\u25e6 maps that have been investigated thus far. These smaller maps\nare created by selecting and mapping only the clusters from the catalogues that lie\nwithin these areas. For the 1\u25e6 \u00d7 1\u25e6 maps, this provides 9000 independent realizations,\nwhereas for the 2\u25e6 \u00d7 2\u25e6 maps we continue using 1000 realizations. The mean power\nspectra for these three different map sizes remain the same.\nThe histograms for the 1\u25e6 \u00d7 1\u25e6 realizations containing both the CMB and the SZ effect are shown in Figure 3.6. As before, for the lowest multipoles the CMB dominates,\nso the histogram for the lowest bin is approximately Gaussian. For the higher multipoles, however, the histograms are significantly skewed towards positive values, much\nmore so than for the 3\u25e6 \u00d73\u25e6 maps. This qualitatively agrees with Zhang & Sheth (2007),\nwho found that larger map sizes decrease the skewness of the probability distribution\ndue to averaging over a larger number of clusters.\nFor the CMB, the standard deviation from the realizations scales linearly with\n1/2\n1/ fsky\n. The ratio of the standard deviation to the mean for the three maps sizes is\n1/2\nshown in Figure 3.7; this scales as 1/ fsky\nfor both the SZ effect on its own and the\n\ncombined CMB and SZ effect. This is as predicted by the analytical formula. The\ntransition between the CMB- and SZ-dominated regimes is clear for all three map\n1/2\nsizes. The skew for the SZ effect also scales close to 1/ fsky\n. If the dependence is\n\u03b1/2\nparameterized as 1/ fsky\nand \u03b1 is calculated independently for each multipole bin, then\n\n\u03b1 \u2248 1.2 at the lowest multipoles, changing to \u2248 0.9 at the highest multipoles. This\nscaling indicates that the skewness can be reduced to < 0.1 for maps larger than 400\nsquare degrees.\nAs we are only considering the clusters within the map size, we will not be including any effects from clusters that are positioned outside the map but extend into the\nmap. This was true for the larger maps considered earlier, however this may become\n\n84\n\n\f1.4\n\n7\n\n1.2\n\n6\n\n1\n\n5\n\n0.8\n\n4\ns\n\n\u03b4 Bi / Bi\n\n3.4: EFFECTS OF CLUSTERING\n\n0.6\n\n3\n\n0.4\n\n2\n\n0.2\n\n1\n\n0\n1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000 10000\n\n0\n1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000 10000\n\nl\n\nl\n\nFigure 3.7: Left: \u03b4Bi / B\u0304i from the SZ effect on its own (top lines) and for the CMB\nand SZ effect combined (bottom lines) with \u03c38 = 0.825 for three different map sizes:\n3\u25e6 \u00d7 3\u25e6 (red solid line), 2\u25e6 \u00d7 2\u25e6 (blue dotted line) and 1\u25e6 \u00d7 1\u25e6 (black double-dotted line).\n1/2\nThe values scale as 1/ fsky\n. Right: As the left plot, but plotting the skewness for the\n1/2\nthree map sizes; this also scales roughly as 1/ fsky\n.\nmore important here as large clusters can extend up to a quarter of a degree in the\nmaps. As the means from the three map sizes differ by less than a percent, however,\nand the standard deviations agree with predictions, this appears to be negligible.\n\n3.4\n\nEffects of clustering\n\nTo check whether the clustering of the galaxy clusters can be responsible for the nonGaussianity in the statistics, we randomize the positions of the clusters on the sky. This\neffectively modifies the angular correlation function to that expected of a Poissonian\ndistribution, although this still includes the effects of clustering due to fluctuations that\nare larger than the map size. For the 3\u25e6 \u00d7 3\u25e6 maps, there is no significant change in any\nof the values of the mean, variance or normalized skew between the statistics of the\nrandomized and the clustered maps. However, when the values of \u03b4Bi / B\u0304i are compared\nto those from the analytical calculations (as described in the Appendix), a 10 \u2212 15 per\ncent excess is present at high multipoles.\nSimply randomising the positions on the sky effectively destroys the clustering between galaxy clusters on scales smaller than the fiducial map size of 3\u25e6 \u00d7 3\u25e6 . However,\n\n85\n\n\f3: STATISTICS OF THE SZ POWER SPECTRUM\n\n1.14\n\n1.15\n\n1.1\n\n1.1\n\n\u03b4 Bi,clustered / \u03b4 Bi,theory\n\n\u03b4 Bi,clustered / \u03b4 Bi,random\n\n1.12\n\n1.08\n1.06\n1.04\n1.02\n1\n\n1.05\n\n1\n\n0.95\n\n0.98\n0.96\n1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000 10000\nl\n\n0.9\n1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000 10000\nl\n\nFigure 3.8: Left: The ratio of \u03b4Bi / B\u0304i from clustered and randomised 1\u25e6 \u00d7 1\u25e6 maps for\nthe three different values of \u03c38 (the red solid line is \u03c38 = 0.825, the blue dotted line\n0.9 and the black double-dotted line 0.75). Clustering increases the standard deviation\nby \u223c 10 per cent. Right: The same as the left figure, but comparing the clustered\nrealizations to the analytical expectation. The increase of \u223c 10 per cent remains.\nthis will not remove the effects of clustering on the mean number density of clusters\nwithin the maps. To illustrate the effect of this, we create sets of 1\u25e6 \u00d7 1\u25e6 maps where\nwe randomise the clusters by two methods: first, selecting the clusters within a 1\u25e6 \u00d7 1\u25e6\narea then randomising their positions (analogous to the randomization performed on\nthe 3\u25e6 \u00d7 3\u25e6 maps), and second, randomising the whole map and then selecting 1\u25e6 \u00d7 1\u25e6\npatches.\nSelecting the clusters that lie within the 1\u25e6 \u00d7 1\u25e6 area and then randomizing their\npositions provides largely the same statistical properties as the clustered realizations,\nas was the case for the 3\u25e6 \u00d7 3\u25e6 realizations. However, if the clusters are randomized\nprior to selection, then the ratio of \u03b4Bi / B\u0304i is close to agreement with the analytical\nestimate, differing by a few percent. The effect of randomising and then selecting the\nclusters is shown in Figure 3.8, which gives the ratio of \u03b4Bi between the clustered and\nrandom realizations ( B\u0304i is the same for the two methods) and between the clustered\nrealizations and the analytical values. Clustering increases \u03b4Bi / B\u0304i by \u223c 10 per cent at\nthe highest multipoles, where the standard deviation is increased as the galaxy clusters\ngroup together in certain realizations and are absent in others, broadening the standard\ndeviation. The lowest multipoles are not well sampled and are highly skewed, such\n\n86\n\n\f3.5: UPPER MASS LIMIT\n\nthat their standard deviation alone does not adequately represent the distribution.\n\n3.5\n\nUpper mass limit\n\nThe power spectrum of the SZ effect measured in different parts of the sky is very\nsensitive to the mass of the largest clusters within that field. Fields used for CMB\nobservations might be preselected to avoid such objects, hence biasing our measurement of the power spectrum. In order to test the dependence on this, we apply a series\nof maximum mass cuts to the Pinocchio catalogues; the mean spectra after these cuts\nare shown in Figure 3.9. Note that the effect of minimum mass cuts was discussed in\nSection 2.4.\nThe mean power spectrum is largely converged at maximum masses \u223c 6 \u2212 8 \u00d7\n1014 h\u22121 M , with the exact values depending on the multipole \u2013 higher mass clusters\ncontribute most to the lowest multipoles. The figure also shows the ratio of the standard\ndeviation to the mean in the multipole bins l = 2000 \u2212 3000 and 3000 \u2212 4000 as\na function of the maximum mass; for both multipole bins, the ratio increases as the\nmaximum mass is increased. The skew also increases with the maximum mass of the\ncluster, approximately doubling between Mmax = 1014 h\u22121 M and 1015 h\u22121 M . Thus, it\nis the largest mass clusters that provide the largest amounts of non-Gaussianity within\nthe power spectrum.\n\n3.6\n\nParameter dependence\n\nThe five free parameters used in the cluster model (see equations 2.32 and 2.35) are not\nyet constrained to high accuracy, with different simulations of galaxy clusters finding\ndifferent values. Observations to measure the SZ effect are still in their early stages,\nand no large scale SZ surveys of clusters yielding many clusters have been carried out\nyet. To see the effect of the uncertainty in these parameters on our results, we vary the\nparameters over a wide range of possible values.\n\n87\n\n\f3: STATISTICS OF THE SZ POWER SPECTRUM\n\n50\n45\nl (l+1) Cl / (2 \u03c0) [\u03bcK2]\n\n40\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n0\n\n1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000 10000\nl\n\n0.22\n0.2\n0.18\n\u03b4 Bi / Bi\n\n0.16\n0.14\n0.12\n0.1\n0.08\n0.06\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n5\n6\n7\nMmax [1014 h-1 M\u2299]\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\ns\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000 10000\nl\n\nFigure 3.9: Top: The mean power spectra from the SZ effect in the \u03c38 = 0.825 cosmology with all clusters (red solid line) and after removing all clusters greater than\n8\u00d7 (green large-dashed), 6\u00d7 (blue small-dashed), 4\u00d7 (pink dotted) and 2 \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M\n(turquoise dot-dashed), from the top down.

Bottom: the skewness s of the distributions for the same mass cuts as the mean power spectra. All three of these quantities\nare significantly affected by the largest mass clusters in the realizations.\n88\n\n\f3.6: PARAMETER DEPENDENCE\n\n3.6.1\n\nParameters of the Y-M relation\n\nThe overall amplitude of the SZ effect is determined by Y\u2217 , which is fiducially set to\n2 \u00d7 10\u22126 Mpc2 . As discussed earlier, Kay et al. (in prep.) find that this can be 1.9 or\n2.3 \u00d7 10\u22126 Mpc2 for non-radiative or preheated gas. Changing this parameter simply\nscales the mean and standard deviation of the spectrum from the SZ effect, with the\n\u0001\nmean and standard deviation being multiplied by Y\u2217,new /Y\u2217,fiducial 2 . This is because the\nincrease does not depend on the structure or distribution of the clusters. There is no\neffect on normalized quantities such as \u03b4Bi / B\u0304i and s from the SZ effect only. Due to\nthe increase in the power from the SZ effect, though, the cross-over point between the\nCMB and SZ effect will be shifted to lower multipoles as Y\u2217 is increased, which will\nincrease \u03b4Bi / B\u0304i and s at those lower multipoles.\nThe evolution of the SZ effect as a function of mass is governed by \u03b3. If the gas is\nassumed to only be gravitationally heated, then \u03b3 = 5/3. This slope could be steeper,\nreflecting a reduced amount of gas mass in smaller clusters, or it could be flatter due\nto an increase in temperature in smaller clusters from extra, non-gravitational energy.\nVia X-ray observations of the inner region of galaxy clusters, Arnaud et al. (2007) find\n1\n\u03b3 = 1.82+0.09\n\u22120.08 for the YX -M relationship , in agreement with the preheating result from\n\nKay et al. (in prep.). As this is measured for the inner region, whilst the SZ effect\nextends much further out in the cluster atmosphere, this is likely to be an upper limit.\nAs such, we use \u03b3 = 1.5 and 1.8 as the expected range for this parameter. The effect of\nthese values on the power spectrum and \u03b4Bi / B\u0304i is shown in the top row of Figure 3.10.\nAs \u03b3 is increased, the peak in the SZ power spectrum shifts to lower multipoles, and\n\u03b4Bi / B\u0304i increases. This is because the power from clusters with a mass over 1014 h\u22121 M\nwill be increased as \u03b3 increases, whilst that from smaller mass clusters will decrease.\nThe larger clusters are dominant at lower multipoles due to their greater angular size, so\nthe peak of the SZ effect will naturally shift to lower multipoles. The effect is similar to\n1\n\nYX = Mgas T X is an X-ray proxy for the integrated SZ effect Y that has recently been shown to\n\ncorrelate well with M with little scatter (Kravtsov et al. 2006).\n\n89\n\n\f3: STATISTICS OF THE SZ POWER SPECTRUM\n\n0.9\n\n\u03b3=1.5,5/3,1.8\n\n70\n\n0.8\n\n60\n\n0.7\n0.6\n\n50\n\u03b4 Bi / Bi\n\nl (l+1) Cl / (2 \u03c0) [\u03bcK2]\n\n80\n\n40\n30\n\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n\n20\n\n0.2\n\n10\n\n0.1\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n\n1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000 10000\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\nl\n80\n\n2\n\n2.2\n\n0.28\n\n\u03b1=-0.3,0,0.3\n\n0.26\n\n60\n\n0.24\n\n50\n\u03b4 Bi / Bi\n\nl (l+1) Cl / (2 \u03c0) [\u03bcK2]\n\n1.8\n\n\u03b3\n\n70\n\n40\n30\n\n0.22\n0.2\n\n20\n\n0.18\n\n10\n\n0.16\n\n0\n0\n\n0.14\n\n1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000 10000\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\nl\n80\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n\u03b1\n0.3\n\ncgas=5,10,20\n\n70\n\n0.28\n\n60\n\n0.26\n\n50\n\n0.24\n\u03b4 Bi / Bi\n\nl (l+1) Cl / (2 \u03c0) [\u03bcK2]\n\n1.6\n\n40\n\n0.22\n\n30\n\n0.2\n\n20\n\n0.18\n\n10\n\n0.16\n0.14\n\n0\n0\n\n1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000 10000\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\ncgas\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nl\n\n25\n\n30\n\n0.8\n\n\u03b2=1/2,2/3,1\n\n120\n\n20\n\n0.6\n80\n\u03b4 Bi / Bi\n\nl (l+1) Cl / (2 \u03c0) [\u03bcK2]\n\n0.7\n100\n\n60\n40\n\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n\n20\n\n0.2\n\n0\n0\n\n1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000 10000\nl\n\n0.1\n1\n\n1.2\n\n\u03b2\n\nFigure 3.10: The effect on the power spectrum from changing the models of the parameters. From top to bottom the parameters are \u03b3 (the mass dependence), \u03b1 (the\nredshift dependence), cgas (the gas concentration) and \u03b2 (the outer gas profile). The left\nhand plots show the mean power spectrum as a function of multipole l. The fiducial\nvalue is shown by the red solid line, with the blue dotted line showing the lower value\nand the black double-dotted line showing the higher value (see text for the parameter values). The data point is the range of values from the three values of \u03c38 in the\n2000-3000 multipole bin. The right hand plots show \u03b4Bi / B\u0304i vs. the parameter values.\nThe solid red line is for the multipole bin l = 2000 \u2212 3000, and the blue dotted line\nis for l = 3000 \u2212 4000. The dashed vertical lines show the three values used in the\nleft-hand plots. The central vertical line is the fiducial value; the \u03b4Bi / B\u0304i for this value\nare between 0.23 \u2212 0.27 and 0.17 \u2212 0.19 for the l = 2000 \u2212 3000 and 3000 \u2212 4000 bins\nrespectively for the three values of \u03c38 .\n90\n\n\f3.6: PARAMETER DEPENDENCE\n\nsimply increasing the mass of all the clusters. Section 3.5 showed that \u03b4Bi / B\u0304i increases\nas larger clusters are included in the maps; the same effect is present here, with high\nvalues of \u03b3 providing the largest increase in the effective mass, hence the largest values\nof \u03b4Bi / B\u0304i .\nThe SZ effect is expected to be self-similar, that is, it will depend on the redshift\nof the cluster via the evolution of the mean matter density within the virial radius\nof the cluster as well as the Friedmann equation. The parameter \u03b1 models evolution\nbeyond that from self-similarity, and is expected to be close to zero. Using numerical\nsimulations, da Silva et al. (2004) find no evidence of evolution from self-similarity.\nTo illustrate the effect of changing this parameter, we choose a modest range of\nvalues: \u03b1 = \u22120.3 and 0.3; the results are presented in the second row of Figure 3.10.\nHigher values of \u03b1 will increase the SZ effect from clusters at the highest redshift.\nAs the clusters at higher redshifts have a smaller angular size, this affects the power\nin the higher multipoles more than that in the lower ones. There are more clusters\nat higher redshifts, so when these provide increased power compared with the low\nredshift clusters the maps will become more similar to each other - it will become\nmore difficult for a single cluster to stand out - hence the standard deviation of the\nmaps will decrease.\n\n3.6.2\n\nParameters of the gas profile\n\nThe final two parameters govern the profile of the SZ effect. The concentration of\nthe gas within the cluster is determined by cgas , and the slope of the cluster profile\nis governed by \u03b2 (see equation 2.32). For \u03b2 we use a fiducial value of 2/3, which is\nin agreement with observations of X-ray emission from nearby clusters by Vikhlinin\net al. (2006) that find \u03b2 \u223c 0.6 \u2212 0.9 at r500 (approximately half of the virial radius).\nAdditionally, Croston et al. (2008) find a range of \u03b2 \u223c 0.37 \u2212 0.81 for a range of radii\nbetween 0.3 and 0.8 R500 . However, steeper values than these are expected in the outer\nregions where the gas pressure profile is expected to trace the NFW profile; this is\n\n91\n\n\f3: STATISTICS OF THE SZ POWER SPECTRUM\n\ndemonstrated by Hallman et al. (2007), who use simulations of clusters to compare\nX-ray and SZ profiles, finding that \u03b2 = 0.88 for X-ray but 1.13 for the SZ effect. As a\nresult, we investigate the effects of \u03b2 = 1/2 and 1. For cgas , we use a fiducial value of\n10 and also try 5 and 20. Duffy et al. (in prep.) indicates that cgas is similar to cDM and\ndepends on the cluster mass by around 10 per cent above 1014 M , such that the values\nwill lie around 5 \u2212 10.\nThe effects of cgas and \u03b2 are shown in the bottom two rows of Figure 3.10. As these\nparameters only change the profile of the SZ effect, the average pixel value within the\nmaps remains constant. The SZ effect is more concentrated within the centre of the\ncluster for higher values of \u03b2 and cgas , with the effect of increasing the mean power\nspectra across all multipoles, but particularly at the higher multipoles, in a similar\nway to the effect of point sources on the power spectrum (see Section 3.7). As the\nparameters are increased, the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean also increases,\nas the power from the central part of the largest (and rarest) clusters becomes more\nimportant at these multipoles.\nThe assumption that all clusters are the same is unlikely to be true; in reality, there\nwill be a certain amount of scatter within the cluster parameters, which may increase\nthe standard deviation further when looking at smaller areas of the sky. Clusters are\nalso likely to deviate from spherical symmetry. The extent of this scatter and its impact\non the SZ effect is not yet known.\n\n3.6.3\n\nComparison to the effects of \u03c38\n\nThe changes in the gas physics have a comparable effect on the mean power spectrum\nas the range of \u03c38 considered in this paper, especially for the outer gas profile \u03b2 and the\nevolution of the Y \u2212 M relationship with redshift (\u03b1). At the same time, the gas physics\ncan substantially increase the standard deviation of the power spectrum to a much\nlarger degree than is possible with \u03c38 , providing a much greater scatter in the power\nfrom different maps. These effects are obviously different to those from \u03c38 when the\n\n92\n\n\f3.7: POWER SPECTRUM STATISTICS WITH POINT SOURCES\n\n9\n8\n\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nFigure 3.11: The correlation matrix for 1000 realizations of the combined CMB, SZ\neffect and 0.2 mJy point sources at 30 GHz, using 3\u25e6 \u00d7 3\u25e6 maps.

This value for the flux density was\nchosen to represent the residual point sources after subtraction from CMB maps due\nto the uncertainty in the point source model. The addition of point sources naturally\nincreases the mean and standard deviation of the spectra at higher multipoles. The\npoint sources also decrease the normalised skewness and the off-diagonal terms of\nthe correlation matrix at 30 GHz (see Figure 3.11) as they can reduce the amount of\npower from the SZ effect by filling in the decrements (Holder 2002). Clustering the\npoint sources increases the chance of this happening, resulting in a slightly lower mean\nvalues for the power spectrum and a slightly reduced standard deviation. The effect\nat 150 GHz is similar to that at 30 GHz, except that the effect of clustering the low\nfrequency point sources is reduced as the unclustered infrared sources are becoming\nmore important.\n\n93\n\n\f3: STATISTICS OF THE SZ POWER SPECTRUM\n\nMultipole bin\n1000-2000\n2000-3000\n3000-4000\n4000-5000\n5000-6000\n6000-7000\n7000-8000\n8000-9000\n9000-10 000\n1000-2000\n2000-3000\n3000-4000\n4000-5000\n5000-6000\n6000-7000\n7000-8000\n8000-9000\n9000-10 000\n1000-2000\n2000-3000\n3000-4000\n4000-5000\n5000-6000\n6000-7000\n7000-8000\n8000-9000\n9000-10 000\n\nCMB+SZ\nB\u0304i\n\u03b4Bi\ns\n720 56 0.40\n150 13 0.59\n58\n7.7 0.70\n47\n6.1 0.68\n45\n5.0 0.50\n44\n4.3 0.49\n42\n3.7 0.40\n40\n3.2 0.39\n38\n2.8 0.41\n720 170 0.90\n150 38\n2.1\n58\n23\n2.6\n47\n18\n2.0\n45\n15\n1.8\n44\n13\n1.7\n42\n11\n1.4\n40\n9.9\n2.0\n38\n8.3\n1.1\n700 52 0.21\n120 7.7 0.26\n24\n2.0 0.51\n13\n1.5 0.66\n11\n1.2 0.47\n11\n1.0 0.49\n10 0.89 0.39\n10 0.76 0.39\n9\n0.67 0.42\n\nCMB+SZ+PS\nB\u0304i\n\u03b4Bi\ns\n730 56\n0.20\n160 13\n0.61\n85 8.1 0.57\n91 6.9 0.40\n110 6.2 0.29\n140 6.1 0.17\n160 6.6 0.06\n200 7.4 0.14\n230 8.0\n0.0\n730 160 0.72\n160 40\n2.0\n84\n24\n2.2\n91\n20\n1.5\n110 19\n1.2\n140 19\n0.84\n170 20\n0.49\n200 22\n0.30\n230 24\n0.34\n700 55\n0.37\n120 7.7 0.16\n33 2.3 0.34\n28 1.9 0.43\n33 1.8 0.29\n41 1.8 0.21\n51 2.2 -0.10\n62 2.5 0.12\n75 3.0 0.16\n\nCMB+SZ+CPS\nB\u0304i\n\u03b4Bi\ns\n720 57\n0.25\n150 13\n0.65\n75 7.7 0.73\n82 6.3 0.56\n100 6.0 0.30\n130 6.0 0.23\n160 6.3 0.23\n190 7.0 0.09\n230 8.2 -0.03\n720 160 0.71\n150 37\n1.9\n74\n22\n2.4\n80\n19\n1.7\n100 17\n1.2\n120 18\n0.82\n150 19\n0.60\n190 21\n0.43\n220 23\n0.32\n700 55\n0.11\n120 7.8 0.18\n33 2.3 0.47\n27 1.8 0.39\n33 1.8 0.18\n41 2.0 0.02\n51 2.3 0.03\n62 2.6 0.13\n75 3.0 0.14\n\nTable 3.2: The statistics of the \u03c38 = 0.825 realizations containing CMB, SZ and point\nsources.

Adding point sources increases the mean\nand standard deviation at high multipoles, as expected. Clustered point sources fill in\nsome of the decrement from the SZ effect, reducing the mean and standard deviation.\n\n94\n\n\f3.8: IMPLICATIONS FOR THE HIGH MULTIPOLE EXCESS\n\nWe do not attempt to account for the effects of imperfectly removing strong point\nsources from the realizations, which may result in a distribution of effective point\nsources with a flux density below the cut-off flux density. This could be an important\nissue, especially if the point sources lie in galaxy clusters, in which case the residual\npoint source flux density could fill in the decrement from the SZ effect.\n\n3.8\n\nImplications for the high multipole excess\n\nThe original, and highest significance, measurement of a possible excess at large multipoles comes from the Cosmic Background Imager. An excess was first announced by\nMason et al. (2003) and was refined by the addition of more observations by Pearson\net al. (2003) and Readhead et al. (2004). The final results were announced by Sievers\net al. (2009) using the full 5 years of observations with the CBI. In total, the CBI has\nobserved five 5\u25e6 \u00d75\u25e6 fields and one 5\u25e6 \u00d76\u25e6 field using mosaicked, shallow observations.\nAdditionally, one 5\u25e6 \u00d70.75\u25e6 and three 0.75\u25e6 \u00d70.75\u25e6 \"deep\" fields were observed, which\nhave reduced noise as they have been observed for longer. Following from Bond et al.\n(2005), Sievers et al. (2009) find that if this excess is due to the SZ effect, then \u03c38 must\nbe between 0.9 and 1.0.\nWe do not attempt to carry out a direct comparison between our results and the CBI\nmeasurements as we omit a number of factors that will be important in this comparison.\nThese include the difference in map sizes and the combination method - we investigate\nthe statistics of 3\u25e6 \u00d73\u25e6 and 0.75\u25e6 \u00d70.75\u25e6 maps separately, whereas the CBI measurement\nresults from the combination of a number of different areas of the sky and different map\nsizes. We do not take into account the effects of the u, v coverage, beam shapes, nor\nthe window function for the observations. We also exclude any effects of noise, point\nsource subtraction and any other foregrounds such as galactic emission or atmospheric\neffects. Finally, we only briefly cover the effects of gas physics and limits on the\nmaximum cluster masses on the statistics. As such, our results are only indicative.\nWe concentrate on two of the bins measured by the CBI, namely l = 2050 \u2212 2350\n\n95\n\n\f3: STATISTICS OF THE SZ POWER SPECTRUM\n\nl (l+1) Cl / (2 \u03c0) [\u03bcK2]\n\n1000\n\n100\n\n10\n0\n\n1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 900010000\nl\n\nFigure 3.12: The power spectra from the CMB+SZ effect for the three cosmologies,\nwith the error bars showing the minimum and maximum values from all 1000 realizations with a map size of 3\u25e6 \u00d7 3\u25e6 .

The mean B\u0304i and\nthe standard deviation \u03b4Bi within the bin i are in \u03bcK2 ; the skew s is dimensionless and\nand the values of S max given are in mJy. The components are the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB), the SZ effect (SZ), point sources (PS) and clustered point sources\n(CPS). The CBI data points are 261 \u00b1 132 and 387 \u00b1 117 \u03bcK2 for the lower and higher\nbin respectively; the final column gives the percentage of realizations at or above the\ncentral values of these measurements.\nCMB and SZ effect within the multipole bin l = 2050 \u2212 2350 for \u03c38 = 0.825 and\nmap sizes of 0.75\u25e6 \u00d7 0.75\u25e6 (representative of the deep fields) and 3\u25e6 \u00d7 3\u25e6 are shown in\nFigure 3.13. The measured value for the CBI power spectrum is compatible with the\nsimulations for this multipole range; 26.5 per cent of the realizations have the same or\n\n98\n\n\f3.8: IMPLICATIONS FOR THE HIGH MULTIPOLE EXCESS\n\nhigher value as the central value from the CBI measurement. The same histogram for\nthe l = 2350 \u2212 3900 bin is shown in Figure 3.14. In this histogram, the distribution is\nsignificantly skewed towards higher values, however the probability of getting the CBI\nexcess from the realizations is low, with only 0.36 per cent of the realizations having\nthe same or more power than the central CBI value. This would be reduced further if\nhigh-mass clusters are removed from the maps.\nTable 3.3 gives the values for the various components and maps sizes for the two\nCBI high-multipole bins. Although the mosaicked fields extend to 5\u25e6 across, we use\n3\u25e6 \u00d7 3\u25e6 fields due to the limits of the simulation box size at the highest redshifts. For\nthe lower multipole bin, we find that the central value can be easily obtained using the\nCMB and SZ effect with \u03c38 = 0.9, and realizations remain with the same amount of\npower for \u03c38 = 0.825. Due to the large error on the measurement, however, it is in\nagreement with a large range of values of \u03c38 . For the higher multipole bin, there are\nno realizations with the central power for any of our three values of \u03c38 using 3\u25e6 \u00d7 3\u25e6\nrealizations. There are 0.75\u25e6 \u00d7 0.75\u25e6 realizations that match the central value, even\ndown to \u03c38 = 0.75, but these are very unlikely, making up less than a percentage of\nthe realizations for the lower values of \u03c38 .\nAdding point sources to the realizations at the level of 0.2 or 1 mJy significantly\nincreases the mean of the realizations in both bins, greatly increasing the number of\nrealizations with the central power or higher as measured by the CBI in both bins.\nClustering the point sources, however, slightly decreases this probability.\nDue to the uncertainty in the parameters controlling the power and profile of the SZ\neffect (see Section 3.6), the mean power spectra given here are uncertain to around 50\nper cent. If this effect is in the positive direction, then this would significantly increase\nthe number of realizations which agree with the CBI excess measurements. We change\ntwo of the parameter values, setting Y\u2217 = 2.3 \u00d7 10\u22126 Mpc2 and \u03b2 = 1 in two different\nsets of realizations. We find that the change in Y\u2217 has little effect, however the change\nin \u03b2 has a dramatic effect on the standard deviation and the skew of the distributions,\nas well as on the mean.\n\n99\n\n\f3: STATISTICS OF THE SZ POWER SPECTRUM\n\nAs shown earlier in Figure 3.9, a large part of the skew and increased standard\ndeviation compared to the mean comes from the largest clusters in the maps. Although\nthere is no formal mass limit for the CBI fields, they were selected to avoid known\nlarge clusters, making it unlikely that any local, high mass clusters are present in the\nfields. This will have the effect of reducing the number of realizations matching the\npower measured by the CBI in accordance with the results of Section 3.5.\nIn addition to the CBI, the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association (BIMA) interferometer operating at 28.5 GHz has also measured an excess. Dawson et al. (2006)\nsurveyed eighteen 6.6 arcminute fields with a total area of \u223c 0.2 square degrees, and\n2\nfound 220+140\n\u2212120 \u03bcK with an average multipole of l = 5237 and a FWHM of 2870. We\n\nmodel this as a constant bin between l = 3800 and 6670. For a thousand realizations\nwith \u03c38 = 0.825 and the same map size as BIMA's 6.6 arcminute field of view, we find\na mean within this bin of 41 \u03bcK2 , a standard deviation of 82 \u03bcK2 and a normalized\nskew of 5.5. Using just the mean and standard deviation, this makes the central value\nof the measurement a \u223c 2.2 \u03c3 excess. We find that 3.3 per cent of the realizations have\ngreater than 220 \u03bcK2 .\nThe Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Array (SZA) has also measured the power spectrum at\nhigher multipoles, putting an upper limit of 149 \u03bcK2 (95 per cent confidence) on the\npower spectrum from secondary anisotropies between l = 2000 \u2212 6000 (Sharp et al.\n2009) using forty-three 12 arcminute fields. As 68 per cent of their multipole coverage\nis between l = 2929 \u2212 5883, we use a constant bin with a width of l = 2900 \u2212 5900.\nWe find a mean of 50 \u03bcK2 , with a standard deviation of 64 and a skew of 5.8. 5.6 per\ncent of the realizations have a power greater than 149 \u03bcK2 . This is compatible with the\nmeasurement from SZA.\nAt higher frequencies, ACBAR has also measured an excess of 34 \u00b1 20 \u03bcK2 at\n150GHz in the range l = 1950 \u2212 3000; this 1.7 \u03c3 excess is compatible with the CBI\nand BIMA measurements if the signal has the spectral distribution of the SZ effect\n(Reichardt et al. 2008). These measurements cover nearly 700 square degrees over 10\nfields; we are limited by the map size of the Pinocchio simulations, which are 9 square\n\n100\n\n\f3.9: CMB POWER SPECTRUM OBSERVATIONS WITH OCRA\n\ndegrees, so cannot make a prediction for these fields. For comparison, however, we\nfind that the SZ effect alone contributes 9.6 \u03bcK2 with a standard deviation of 2.2 \u03bcK2\nand a skew of 0.94 within the bin l = 1950\u22123000 for 3\u25e6 \u00d73\u25e6 maps. We note that QUaD\n(Friedman et al. 2009) also measure the 150 GHz power spectrum at high multipoles;\nthey find values that are compatible with \u039bCDM on its own with no SZ effect required.\n\n3.9\n\nCMB power spectrum observations with OCRA\n\nThe OCRA receivers are sensitive to multipoles ` \u223c 4000, and hence could potentially\nbe used to investigate the high multipole excess. In order to investigate this, simulations were run using maps of the CMB and SZ effect created as described in Chapter\n2. These were convolved with the 2-beam window function of OCRA using (White &\nSrednicki 1995):\nW` = B2` (\u03c3)2 (1 \u2212 P` (cos(\u03b10 ))) ,\n\n(3.4)\n\n\u221a\nin which \u03c3 is the beam width, calculated via \u03c3 = \u03b8FWHM / 8 ln 2 where the \u03b8FWHM =\n1.2 arcmin for OCRA, Pl are the zeroth-order Legendre polynomials, and \u03b10 is the\ndistance between the beams; here 3.0 arcmin. The window function from the beam is\ncalculated by\n!\n1\n2\nB` (\u03c3) = exp \u2212 `(` + 1)\u03c3 .\n2\n\n(3.5)\n\nThe window functions for a range of different values of \u03c3 and \u03b10 are shown in Figure 3.15. For OCRA, the peak in the multipole sensitivity is around 4000. The CBI\nmeasurement of the high multipole excess is primarily around l \u2248 2500; if this is due\nto either of the SZ effect or point sources, then the effect should be comparable or\nstronger at the multipole range of OCRA.\nNoise is then added to the map using Gaussian random numbers with a mean of\nzero and a variance defined by the noise per pixel, calculated by\ns\n\u03a9beam\n\u03c3pixel = \u03c3beam\n\u03a9pixel\n\n(3.6)\n\n101\n\n\f3: STATISTICS OF THE SZ POWER SPECTRUM\n\n3\n\nWindow function, Wl\n\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n0\n\n2000\n\n4000\n\n6000\n\n8000\n\n10000\n\nMultipole, l\n\nFigure 3.15: The window functions of 2-beam receivers, calculated using Equation\n3.4.

The noise\n\nis then subtracted from the power spectrum using < ClNoise >= \u03c32pixel \u03a9pixel . This removes the average noise power, but the random fluctuations in the noise levels remain.\nThe window function is then removed by dividing by W` , and the power spectrum is\nbinned as before.\nThe noise can be analytically calculated in a similar way to cosmic variance (see\nequation 2.9) from the mean power spectrum of the CMB and the weighted power\nspectrum of the Gaussian noise via\nv\nt\n!2\n!2\n\u03c32beam \u03a9beam\n1 X l(l + 1)\n2\n\u03b4Bi =\nCl +\n,\n\u2206l l\u2208bin\n2\u03c0\n(2l + 1) fsky\nWl\n\n(3.7)\n\nNote that this does not include the increase in cosmic variance due to the SZ effect,\nor any noise that is not Gaussian.

These\nerrors provide a reasonable degree of improvement over those obtained by the CBI\nobservations (132 \u03bcK2 and 117 \u03bcK2 respectively). The histograms for these two bins\nare shown in Figure 3.17, along with a Gaussian fit. As with the CMB (see Section\n2.1), the histogram is slightly skewed to higher values due to the finite sampling.\nThe dependence of the predicted uncertainty in the two highest multipole bins observed by the CBI is shown in Figure 3.18 for fields between 1\u25e6 and 10\u25e6 on a side, all\n\u22121/2\nwith 100 \u03bcK noise per beam. The noise scales approximately as fsky\n. Additionally,\n\nthe same simulations are carried out for 1\u25e6 \u00d7 1\u25e6 fields using noise levels between 50\nand 1000 \u03bcK per beam; the uncertainty scales as \u03c32 as expected.\nWhen the astrophysical signal from the CMB and SZ effect (with \u03c38 = 0.825) are\nadded in, the error increases to 96 \u03bcK2 for the multipole bin 2050-2350, and 57 \u03bcK2\nfor the multipole bin 2350-3900, where the increase is due to cosmic variance. When\nthe signal is entirely from the CMB, but with the same mean power spectrum, then\nthese numbers decrease to 94 and 46 \u03bcK2 , reflecting the previously described increase\nin cosmic variance due to the SZ effect. These numbers remain competitive with the\nCBI observations, however lower noise measurements or larger map sizes would be\npreferable to obtain an improved measurement.

For a 3\u25e6 \u00d73\u25e6 field observed\nto 100 \u03bcK OCRA can measure the CBI multipole bins to a factor of 2 lower in noise,\nand also provides power spectrum information at higher multipoles.\nthese values are fixed for the OCRA instrument. Additionally, a range of different values for the input signal could be used, e.g. depending on the different values of \u03c38 ,\nhowever this has not been investigated as this should not significantly affect the noise\nlevels that the experiment can obtain. Point sources are currently not considered; an\ninteresting extension to this work would be to add these into the simulations. Finally,\n\n106\n\n\f3.10: CONCLUSIONS\n\nthese simulations have only considered Gaussian noise; 1/ f noise will be important\non the large scales (longer timescales), with the exact amount depending on the scan\nstrategy used. Due to this dependency on the mapping strategies, the end-to-end simulations described in the next chapter are most suited to considering this.\nAn important consideration in assessing these simulations is the required observation time. OCRA-p has a theoretical noise level of around 10 mJy s1/2 (see Section\n5.1), which converts into \u223c 1.3 mK s1/2 . In order to obtain a measurement in a beam\nto 100 \u03bcK, approximately 49 s of integration time are required. With a 1.2 arcminute\nbeam, one square degree is \u223c 2500 beams. Assuming that OCRA-F has similar performance, and taking into account the four pairs of receivers within OCRA-F (which\nspeeds up the survey by a factor of four), the total amount of telescope time required\nwould be \u223c 1 \u00d7 105 seconds, or 30 hours of integration time, per square degree.\nThis obviously depends linearly on the number of beams that the receiver has; completing OCRA-F (16 beams) would halve this time requirement. The time estimate\nexcludes overheads \u2013 including calibration and T sys measurements \u2013 however using\nthe receiver in survey mode, rather than carrying out pointed observations, should significantly reduce the observation overhead compared with OCRA-p observations thus\nfar. 1/ f gain fluctuations and atmospheric fluctuations will also present observational\nchallenges. Finally, it should also be noted that this observation time requires good\nweather, which restricts the number of days that are available for these observations.\nHowever, from these simulations it appears that the time requirements for OCRA-F to\ncontribute towards observations of the CBI excess are not prohibitive.\n\n3.10\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have simulated the microwave sky, including the CMB, SZ effect and point sources,\nand have used Pinocchio to generate large numbers of cluster catalogues with realistic\ndistributions for three different values of \u03c38 . Using these maps, we have investigated\nthe statistics of the power spectrum between multipoles of 1000 and 10 000. We find\n\n107\n\n\f3: STATISTICS OF THE SZ POWER SPECTRUM\n\nthat the inclusion of the SZ effect increases the standard deviation of the power spectrum by a factor of 3 over that expected from cosmic variance, in agreement with the\npredictions from an analytical calculation based on the halo formalism. The mean and\n1/2\nstandard deviation vary as 1/ fsky\nas expected, and scale approximately as \u03c378 over the\n\nrange of values sampled here. We also find that the distributions are non-Gaussian, and\nare skewed by large mass clusters, with the degree of this skewness increasing as the\nmap size is decreased. Additionally, we find that correlations between galaxy clusters\nplay a small role in the statistics of the power spectrum at the level of \u223c10 per cent.\nSeveral instruments have measured an excess at high multipoles, which may be\ndue to the SZ effect with a large value of \u03c38 . We cannot explain the central values\nof these measurements with the range of \u03c38 investigated here, however the increased\nstandard deviation and the presence of skewness in the distribution means that these\nmeasurements could be explained by a lower value of \u03c38 than has been suggested\nso far. There is also a large uncertainty in the parameters describing the cluster gas\nphysics, which can have a large effect on the mean of the distributions, comparable\nto that from the different values of \u03c38 , and can also significantly effect the standard\ndeviation and the skew of the distributions.\nThe next generation of CMB instruments are currently being commissioned, and\nare expected to provide more data at multipoles comparable to those probed by the\nCBI. The Planck satellite will measure the power spectrum from the whole sky out\nto multipoles of 2500 within the next few years, and instruments such as the South\nPole Telescope (SPT; Ruhl et al. 2004), the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager (AMI;\nZwart et al. 2008) and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT; Fowler 2004) will\nobserve large numbers of galaxy clusters using the SZ effect. These measurements\nwill provide much more information on the SZ effect and may provide a resolution\nto the discrepancy in \u03c38 from the measurements to date. Our results should also be\nrelevant to these observations. Additionally, future OCRA observations may be able\nto carry out observations of the CBI excess to either confirm or refute the existence of\nthis high-multipole excess\n\n108\n\n\f4\nEnd-to-end simulations of OCRA\nIn order to get the best results from real observations, the observational methods and\nthe contributions to the instrument noise need to be well understood. Lowe (2006)\nconstructed a computer simulation (UMBRELLA, an Upper Millimeter Band Receiver\nEmulator for Large Linked Arrays) of the OCRA-p instrument (see \u00a71.4), involving a\nmodel of the atmosphere, the telescope and the receiver system. UMBRELLA was\nfirst used to perform mock drift scan observations of point sources. With the further\nwork described in this chapter, it can now be used to carry out mock observations of\nSZ clusters from Virtual Sky simulations to complement the extensive observations of\nSZ clusters that have been carried out using OCRA-p (Lancaster et al. 2007, Lancaster\net al. in prep.). It has also been extended to simulate the more complex OCRA-F\ninstrument, and hence it could be used to find the best observing methods for trial\nblind surveys. This would also enable the quantification of the detection efficiency of\nclusters with different masses and redshifts using OCRA-F.\nIn order to analyse the simulated data (and, of course, the real OCRA data) an\nautomated data reduction software package is required. The creation of this software\nis described in the next section. Simulated noise power spectra have been created\nwith UMBRELLA to investigate the effects of Gaussian noise, 1/ f gain fluctuations\nand atmospheric fluctuations on the double-differenced noise power spectrum (Section\n4.2.1). The data reduction software has then been linked with UMBRELLA, and the\n\n109\n\n\f4: END-TO-END SIMULATIONS OF OCRA\n\ncombination has been used to simulate and analyse point source observations, and to\ninvestigate the data reduction methods that can be applied to these observations (Sections 4.2.2 and 4.2.3). The chapter is summarized in Section 4.3, which also discusses\nthe future work that can be done based upon the tools developed here. The overall plan\nof the end-to-end simulations is shown in Figure 4.1.\n\n4.1\n\nData reduction\n\nThere are currently two observational methods utilized by OCRA-p. \"Cross-scan\"\nmeasurements are used for strong sources, and \"on-off\" measurements for weak sources.\nIn both of these methods, a calibration diode is observed. This calibration diode is located in the receiver cabin of the telescope, and transmits into OCRA-p by means of\na wire protruding into one of the receiver horns. The methods of reducing data from\neach of these observing techniques to give a measured flux density for the source is\ncovered in the next two sections. The calibration method is then described in Section\n4.1.3. The calculation of the final flux densities \u2013 including the identification of bad\ndata \u2013 is described in Section 4.1.4. The data reduction process is used both for the\nend-to-end simulations, described later on in this chapter, and also for the observations\ntaken with OCRA-p (see Section 5). As such, the data reduction process is described\nin general terms rather than solely focusing on the elements that are relevant to the\nsimulations.\n\n4.1.1\n\nCross-scan measurements\n\nStrong (> 50 mJy) sources can be observed by scanning the two beams of OCRA-p\nacross the source. \"Cross-scan\" measurements are carried out by first scanning across\nthe source position in elevation, such that the source passes through only one of the\nbeams, which are separated in azimuth. These are immediately analysed and a pointing correction in elevation is calculated and applied for that position on the sky.

Following on from\nthis, a short (\u223c 10 s) measurement of a blank section of sky is made, followed by a\nshort (\u223c 10 s) measurement of a calibration diode. An example of this type of measurement is show in Figure 4.2. All measurements of calibrator sources are performed\nusing this method.\nThe data are automatically binned by the Data AcQuisition system (DAQ) into 1\nsecond samples, and a scatter from the measurements within that second is also calculated. The measurements are recorded along with the time since the start of the\nobservation and the difference in azimuth and elevation from the assumed source position at the time of the measurement.\nThe pointing correction from the elevation scan is fitted automatically at the telescope, with the peak position used for the azimuthal scan. Thus, strong sources act\nas their own pointing calibrator and can be observed regardless of any initial offsets\nin the telescope pointing. The peak value from the azimuthal scan is then used as a\n\n112\n\n\f4.1: DATA REDUCTION\n\nmeasurement of the flux density of the source. In reality, the signal will be noisy, so a\nfit is applied to the data to determine the source flux density. We use a nine parameter\nnon-linear least squares fit, involving a quadratic background and two gaussians:\n!\n!\n\u2212(t \u2212 t1 )2\n\u2212(t \u2212 t2 )2\n2\nf (t) = B0 + B1 t + B2 t + A1 exp\n+ A2 exp\n(4.1)\n2\u03c321\n2\u03c322\nHere, Bi represents the quadratic background terms, A1 and A2 the amplitude of the\nGaussian peaks, t1 and t2 the times at which the peaks occur and \u03c31 and \u03c32 represent\nthe widths of the two peaks. In the case of a perfect measurement, A1 = A2 and\n\u03c31 = \u03c32 . The average of A1 and A2 is used to calculate the measured flux density of\nthe source, with a measurement error calculated from the root mean square (rms) of\nthe fitting errors on these two parameters.\nAs a cross-check, a fit is also applied to the elevation scans in a similar way to the\nazimuthal scans, except using a 5-parameter 1 gaussian fit:\n\u2212(t \u2212 t1 )2\nf (t) = B0 + B1 t + A1 exp\n2\u03c321\n\n!\n(4.2)\n\nThe amplitude of the elevation scan compared with that from the azimuth scan can then\nbe used to check whether the scan was successful (the amplitude from the azimuth scan\nshould always be greater or equal to the amplitude from the elevation scan).\n\n4.1.2\n\nOn-off measurements\n\nFor weaker (< 50 mJy) sources, cross-scan measurements are not sensitive enough,\nso \"on-off\" measurements are performed. These consist of a series of measurements\nwhere one of the beams of the receiver is directed to the source position, with the\nother on blank sky, thus measuring the power difference between the source and the\nbackground value; after 30 seconds or so the beams are swapped over. This is repeated\nseveral times during a measurement cycle, or many times in the case of a measurement\nof a very weak source such as an SZ cluster. Subsequently the background level is\nmeasured, followed by the calibration diode.\n\n113\n\n\f4: END-TO-END SIMULATIONS OF OCRA\n\nDouble-differenced output (mV)\n\n13\n12.5\n12\n11.5\n11\n10.5\n10\n9.5\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n1400\n\n1600\n\nTime (s)\n\nDouble-differenced output (mV)\n\n8\n7.5\n7\n6.5\n6\n5.5\n5\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\nTime (s)\n\nFigure 4.3: Example on-off measurements, with a final noise diode calibration.

Bottom: the SZ cluster 0016+16, observed by Lancaster et al. (2007).\n\n114\n\n\f4.1: DATA REDUCTION\n\nAs with the cross-scan observations, the data are automatically binned into 1 second samples. The azimuth and zenith angle of the telescope, as well as the time of the\nmeasurement, are also recorded. A marker is recorded for each sample, saying whether\nthe measurement is of the background (1), the calibration diode (3), with the \"positive\"\nbeam on source (4) or with the \"negative\" beam on source (6). Data are not currently\nrecorded whilst the telescope is moving between positions.\nThe pattern of the on-off scans \u2013 i.e. which order the different types of measurements are made in, and how many measurements are made within a single session \u2013\nhas evolved over time and also depend on the sources being observed. The reduction\nmethods have been kept general to cope with all formats.\nFor each measurement state i, the average (denoted S i ) and the scatter (\u03c3i ) of the\ndata are calculated. The average and scatter is also calculated for both the first (S i,1 and\n\u03c3i,1 ) and second (S i,2 and \u03c3i,2 ) halves of the measurement state, to enable the removal\nof any long-period drifts caused by atmospheric or gain fluctuations that are present in\nthe measurement. To remove any spikes in the data, data points that are more than 3\u03c3\naway from the mean are rejected with the mean and scatter subsequently recalculated.\nThe source flux density is determined using a series of different methods, which\nare described below. The efficiency of these double-difference methods are compared\nin Section 4.2.3 using model inputs, and are also contrasted using real data in Section\n5.2.\nDouble differencing\nThe standard method of \"double-differencing\" the measurement to calculate the source\nflux density is to use\nS DD =\n\n1X\n0.5 (\u00b1S i\u22121 \u2213 S i ) ,\nN\n\n(4.3)\n\nwith an error calculated by\n\u03c3DD\n\nq\n1 X\n(0.5\u03c3i\u22121 )2 + (0.5\u03c3i )2 .\n= \u221a\nN\n\n(4.4)\n\n115\n\n\f4: END-TO-END SIMULATIONS OF OCRA\n\nHere, the sum is over all measurements made with either the positive or negative beam\non the source. If the pair of measurement states are positive then negative, this corresponds to +S i\u22121 \u2212 S i ; otherwise it corresponds to \u2212S i\u22121 + S i . N is the total number of\nstate pairs that are summed over.\nSymmetric double differencing\nThe double-differencing method works well where there is a flat background, but becomes unreliable once linear drifts are present in the data. To cope with these drifts,\nsymmetric differencing can be performed, subtracting the average of the two negative\nstates either side of the positive state,\nS =\n\n1X\n0.5 (S i \u2212 0.5(S i\u22121 + S i+1 ))\nN\n\n(4.5)\n\nwhere the sum is over all states that have the positive beam on source, with measurements using the negative beam on either side. N is the number of states where this is\nthe case. The error is calculated by:\n1 Xp\n\u03c3= \u221a\n(0.5\u03c3i )2 + (0.25\u03c3i\u22121 )2 + (0.25\u03c3i+1 )2\nN\n\n(4.6)\n\nWhere there exist two adjacent measurements (e.g. neg-pos-neg-pos-neg), then this\nmethod will use the central measurement state twice; to avoid this, the negative states\ncan be subdivided into two measurements, such that\nS SDD =\n\n\u0001\n1X\n0.5 S i \u2212 0.5(S i\u22121,2 + S i+1,1 )\nN\n\n(4.7)\n\nwhere the sum is as before. The error is calculated by:\n\u03c3SDD\n\nq\n1 X\n= \u221a\n(0.5\u03c3i )2 + (0.25\u03c3i\u22121,2 )2 + (0.25\u03c3i+1,1 )2 .\nN\n\n(4.8)\n\nEssentially this is the same as the first symmetric double-difference method, but using\nthe second half of the first negative measurement, and the first half of the second, either\nside of the positive measurement. In the case of a long series of measurements of a\nweak source, measurements 3\u03c3 away from the mean are rejected, with the mean and\n\n116\n\n\f4.1: DATA REDUCTION\n\nscatter recalculated. This removes any large jumps in the data stream. This method\nwas initially tested on SZ observations with OCRA-p by K. Lancaster and M. Birkinshaw (private communication) and found to perform better than the standard doubledifferencing method; it was subsequently adopted as the fiducial double-difference reduction method for OCRA-p data.\nSubtraction of a quadratic background\nThe symmetric double-differencing technique is adequate for linear drifts, but will in\nturn break down if quadratic or higher order drifts are observed. These can be removed\nby subtracting a quadratic background B0 + B1 t + B2 t2 from the data, before calculating\nthe double differenced flux density. The values that are used to find the quadratic background are the measured background (\"bg\") values directly, and also the differences\nbetween positive and negative states. e.g. where an observation is bg1-pos1-neg1pos2-neg2-bg2, the values used are (bg1, 0.5 (pos1+neg1), 0.5 (neg1+pos2), 0.5 (pos2\n+ neg2), bg2). The times of these values are the mid-points of the data used. All values\nthat lie after the calibrator measurement are ignored.\nThe background is subtracted from the data, and the averages and scatter of the\ndata within each measurement state are recomputed. The source flux density is then\ncalculated from\nS QDD =\n\n1X\n\u00b1S i ,\nN\n\n(4.9)\n\nwhere S i is added if the measurement state is positive, or subtracted if the measurement\nstate is negative. The error is calculated by\n1\n\u03c3QDD = \u221a\nN\n\nqX\n\n\u03c32i\n\nAn alternative to this is to use the weighted sum:\nP\n\u00b1S i \u03c3\u22122\nS QDDW = P \u22122i\n\u03c3i\n\u03c3QDDW = \u03c3DD4\n\n(4.10)\n\n(4.11)\n(4.12)\n\n117\n\n\f4: END-TO-END SIMULATIONS OF OCRA\n\nFor longer measurements, higher order terms can be subtracted. Using the same\ntechnique as for a quadratic background, a polynomial background is subtracted, and\nthe symmetric double-difference technique is used to measure the flux density. This is\nreferred to here as S PSDD .\nLeast Squares Fitting\nFinally, rather than dealing with each on-off state separately, the whole data file can be\nsimultaneously fitted for using a least squares fitter. We use\nf (t) = B0 + B1 t + B2 t2 (S LSDD )(+S cal )\n\n(4.13)\n\nwhere Bi represents the quadratic background, and where the addition/subtraction of\nS dd and S cal depends on the measurement state. Assuming that these are the only terms\npresent, then this should return the a good fit to the measurement; where additional\nterms are present then this will return a bad fit.\n\n4.1.3\n\nCalibration\n\nGain-elevation correction\nThe gain of a radio telescope depends on the accuracy of the telescope surface, the\nangle at which the bowl of the telescope is inclined (the elevation of the telescope)\nand also the position of the receiver in the focal plane. All of these can be affected\nby gravitational deformations of the structure. A \"gain-elevation correction\" can be\napplied to correct for these effects. This correction has been measured at a series of\nelevation angles using observations of NGC 7027; a correction function can then be\nused to correct measurements of sources made at any elevation.\nThe gain-elevation correction values have changed several times during the time\nover which OCRA-p has been installed on the Toru\u0144 telescope. The initial correction\nfunction was (B. Pazderska, private communication):\nS corrected = S measured \u00d7 (2.7 + 0.25h \u2212 0.0049h2 + 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 h3 )/6.58.\n\n118\n\n(4.14)\n\n\f4.1: DATA REDUCTION\n\n1.1\nGain as a function of elevation\n\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\nElevation (degrees)\n\nFigure 4.4: Gain-elevation curves for OCRA-p.

The latest curve shows\nthe effect of relocating OCRA-p off-axis to accommodate OCRA-F.\n\nThe surface accuracy was improved during the summer of 2006; following this the\ngain-elevation correction changed to (A.

In order to prepare for the installation of OCRA-F, OCRA-p was relocated to one side of the focal plane in mid\nAugust 2009. The gain-elevation function following this is (M. Gawronski, private\ncommunication):\nS corrected = S measured \u00d7 (0.18 + 0.033h \u2212 0.00044h2 + 1.8 \u00d7 10\u22126 h3 ).\n\n(4.16)\n\nThese three gain-elevation corrections are plotted in Figure 4.4.\nAdditionally, following from the move of OCRA-p off-axis the \"negative\" beam\nof the instrument systematically under-measured the flux density of the source during\n\n119\n\n\f4: END-TO-END SIMULATIONS OF OCRA\n\ncross-scan measurements. A correction function for this is used for all cross-scan\nmeasurements since then:\n\u0010\n\u0011\nVnegative,corrected = Vnegative \u00d7 1.2 \u2212 0.0006h \u2212 2.64 \u00d7 10\u22126 h2 \u2212 1.35 \u00d7 10\u22127 h3 . (4.17)\nAtmospheric absorption correction\nA correction is also applied for the absorption of the signal in the atmosphere. This\nis achieved via the measurements of the system temperature at zenith and at 60 degrees from zenith. As the latter measurement contains twice the air mass of the first,\nthe difference of these two measurements provides the temperature contribution of the\npartially transparent atmosphere, T atmosphere . The optical depth \u03c4 of the atmosphere can\nthen be calculated from this by \u03c4 = T atmosphere /T phys , where T phys is the physical temperature of the atmosphere (typically 260-270 K). A multiplicative correction factor for\nthe absorption of the signal from the astronomical source can then be calculated by\n!\n\u03c4\nS corrected = 1 +\nS measured\n(4.18)\ncos(\u03b8)\nwhere \u03b8 is the zenith angle of the measurement. The correction is typically \u223c 3 \u2212 10\nper cent of the flux density of the source.\nFlux density calibration\nThe reduction of data from the two observational methods starts with a value in volts,\nrepresentative of the detected RF power coming out of the receiver. The relationship\nbetween volts and the actual source flux density depends on the properties and environment of the receiver and telescope, and can be measured by observing a bright\nastrophysical source with a known flux density. The standard calibrator source used\nfor OCRA is NGC 7027, a planetary nebula with a flux density of 5.47 \u00b1 0.04 Jy at\n30 GHz in 2008 (Hafez et al. 2008, also see Section 5.2.1). Although NGC 7027 is\nslowly decaying in flux density over time, a constant value is assumed for each data\nreduction. The ratio of the known flux density to volts for this source can be used to\nconvert measured voltages into flux densities for other sources.\n\n120\n\n\f4.1: DATA REDUCTION\n\nSecondary calibrators are then used to reduce the time between the source observations and the primary calibration; not only would it be prohibitively expensive in telescope time to re-observe NGC 7027 every hour, but there are times when this source\nis not at a suitable elevation to be observed. One of a network of secondary calibrator\nsources is hence observed; these sources provide both telescope pointing calibration\nmeasurements and can also be used in flux density calibration.\nTo improve the calibration further, a calibrator diode is observed during each measurement. The calibration diode is assumed to remain stable between calibrator measurements, hence any variations in the measured voltage is assumed to originate from\ngain fluctuations within the receiver. The effective flux density of the calibration diode\nis determined by measuring both it and a background for 10 seconds each, then working out the average of both and subtracting one from the other. The diode was not\nthought to be sufficiently stable during the CJF observations (Lowe et al. 2007), so\nthe secondary calibrator sources were used for calibration. However, for subsequent\nobservations it was thought to be more stable, so it was used as the default secondary\nflux density calibrator, although we do have to recalibrate it regularly. As such, the\nsecondary calibrator sources are now only used for pointing corrections.\nThe measured voltages of NGC 7027 are smoothed over the period of a day by averaging over measurements of NGC 7027 taken 12 hours each side of the source measurement that is being calibrated. If there are no measurements of NGC 7027 within\nthe smoothing period either side of the measurement, then the nearest measurement is\nused. The ratio of the NGC 7027 flux density to the gain-elevation and atmospherecorrected voltage is then used to calibrate the calibration diode. The individual source\nmeasurements are then calibrated using the same ratio but calculated from either the\ncalibration diode or the secondary calibrator sources. Finally, the individual measurements are corrected for gain-elevation and atmosphere.\n\n121\n\n\f4: END-TO-END SIMULATIONS OF OCRA\n\n4.1.4\n\nCalculation of source flux densities\n\nFlagging bad data\nFlagging of \"bad\" data \u2013 cases where the measurement has known problems, for example contamination by the weather or by incorrect pointing \u2013 can either be done\nmanually or automatically. Although it is not too prohibitive in time to check through\nall of the OCRA-p measurements (circa 10 000), automatic flagging applies a common standard across all of the measurements, rather than relying on human judgement.\nHowever, manual flagging remains useful for segments of the data with specific issues\n(for example, if the calibration diode was highly variable).\nFor all measurement types, data are flagged when they were taken at an elevation\nlower than 30\u25e6 . Below that elevation, the telescope performance is not well characterized at 30 GHz, and a large atmospheric correction is required.\nBad cross-scans can be identified by comparing the amplitudes and widths of the\ntwo gaussian peaks; these should ideally agree with each other, but are frequently\nnot the same e.g. where the source has only passed through one beam due to poorly\ndetermined pointing offsets. Measurements where there are large differences in these\ncan be automatically flagged; this is currently applied where the ratios differ by greater\nthan 20 per cent. The amplitude of the azimuthal cross-scans should always be equal\nto, or higher than, the elevation scan; if it is not, then that indicates that the source was\n\"missed\".\nIt is more tricky to find erroneous on-off measurements. At present measurements\nare automatically flagged if the error on the measurement is above a threshold \u2013 typically 7 mJy \u2013 with additional manual flagging carried out as necessary.\nSource position checks\nIn order to check that the correct source position was observed (and that the correct\nsource name was associated with the measurement), the right ascension (RA) and declination (Dec) of the measurement are calculated from the recorded azimuth and ele-\n\n122\n\n\f4.2: SIMULATED OCRA-P OBSERVATIONS WITH UMBRELLA\n\nvation of the telescope during the observation. As this will yield the RA and Dec at the\nobservation epoch, these are then precessed to J2000 coordinates using Libnova1 .\nAfter precession has been applied, there remain some differences between the actual source position and the position calculated from the file. There are three reasons\nfor these differences. The first reason is that the wrong source was observed due to\nan observer error; these are either resolved by comparison of the list of measurements\nwith the observation log, or removed. The second reason is that the azimuth, elevation\nand time used to calculate the position are taken from the start of the observations,\nwhich for cross-scans will be offset from the actual source position. However due to\nthe large separation of sources strong enough to carry out cross-scan observations, this\ndiscrepancy is rarely important in the identification of incorrectly named sources. The\nthird reason is that the recorded azimuth and elevation will not take into account the\npointing corrections applied within the control system, which could contain residual\nerrors.\nFinal flux density values\nThe final flux densities are calculated using the weighted mean and associated error\nusing all of the measurements for a given source, with the weighing factor depending\non the error on each measurement calculated as described above. This has an advantage\nover the simple average of the measurements in that any measurements with large\nestimated errors (e.g. those affected by atmospheric emission at a higher level than\nusual) are downweighted, with preference given to measurements with small errors.\n\n4.2\n\nSimulated OCRA-p observations with UMBRELLA\n\nThe UMBRELLA software package was modified to mimic the observational methods\nused by OCRA-p \u2013 namely, cross-scan and on-off measurements \u2013 and output the\nresults in the same data formats as are used for real measurements (clearly marked\n1\n\nAvailable from http://libnova.sourceforge.net/\n\n123\n\n\f4: END-TO-END SIMULATIONS OF OCRA\n\nto avoid confusion between the two). This means that the data reduction software\ncan used in exactly the same way for both the simulated and real data. UMBRELLA\nwas also modified to automatically write a batch script to automate the data reduction\nprocess. A simple shell script can then be used to run the two programs and analyse the\nresults. In addition, UMBRELLA is now capable of simulating observations of Virtual\nSky maps, although this option is not used within this section.\nUMBRELLA has been configured to simulate OCRA-p mounted on a 32-m telescope, following the configuration used by Lowe (2006). The hybrids are modeled\nusing an imperfect power splitting as measured in Lowe (2006), of 0.497:0.503. The\ndifference between the two phase switch states is set to 170\u25e6 , again matching that measured for OCRA-p. We use a nominal gain for all of the amplifiers of 27dB; the precise\nvalue for this gain is unimportant so long as the noise levels from the amplifiers are\ndefined appropriately.\n\"Noise\" can be added into the simulated timestream in three different ways: Gaussian thermal noise from the amplifiers; 1/ f gain fluctuations within the amplifiers;\nand atmospheric 1/ f -like absorption and emission fluctuations. Gaussian noise can be\ngenerated using a random number generator, and is relatively quick to calculate compared with the other two methods. 1/ f gain fluctuations depend on the history of the\ntime series (the method used to create a timestream of these fluctuations is described\nin Section 4.3.2 of Lowe 2006), hence this takes longer to simulate. The most time\nconsuming noise source to generate is the atmosphere; UMBRELLA uses a fractal atmospheric model as described in Section 5.2 of Lowe (2006), which is convolved in\nreal space with the near-field beam of the telescope.\nWe use the settings from Lowe (2006) for the Gaussian noise and 1/ f gain fluctuations, which provide a knee frequency of \u223c 20 Hz from a single output. For the atmospheric model, we use an atmospheric layer at a height of 500 m moving at 10 m/s,\nwith an optical depth \u03c4 = 0.03, corresponding to the best observing conditions experienced at the sea-level Toru\u0144. The temperature of the atmosphere is set to 260 K, with\nvariations on the scale of the aperture size initially chosen to be 0.5 K and a turbulent\n\n124\n\n\f4.2: SIMULATED OCRA-P OBSERVATIONS WITH UMBRELLA\n\n-0.14\n-0.145\n-0.15\n\nOutput voltage (mV)\n\nD\n\n-0.155\nDD\n\n-0.16\n-0.165\n\nD\n\n-0.17\n-0.175\n-0.18\n-0.185\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n600\nSample number\n\n800\n\n1000\n\nFigure 4.5: An example of the double-differencing carried out on the switched output\nfrom OCRA.

However, it is difficult to\ndisentangle them. We use reasonable estimates of the noise levels in comparison to\nmeasurements taken with OCRA-p, but we caution that at this stage these should be\ntaken as indicative. Further improvements to this depend on the ability to distinguish\nreceiver 1/ f gain fluctuations from atmospheric fluctuations. This should become easier using multiple receiver chains as in OCRA-F; the common mode in the signal from\nthe different chains will be diagnostic of the atmosphere.\n\n4.2.1\n\nSimulated noise power spectra\n\nThe power spectra of the three different simulated components from Gaussian noise\nonly and both Gaussian noise and 1/ f gain fluctuations are shown in Figure 4.6. The\npower spectrum of the noise from one of the two outputs is shown (the other output\nis analogous), as well as the \"differenced\" power spectrum, which is calculated by\nsubtracting one output from the other. This greatly reduces the 1/ f gain fluctuations\n\n125\n\n\f4: END-TO-END SIMULATIONS OF OCRA\n\nFigure 4.6: Simulated receiver noise power spectra for Gaussian (left) and combined\nGaussian and 1/ f noise (right).

The \"double-differenced\" power spectrum is also shown,\nwhich is calculated by subtracting one phase switch state from the other. This reduces\nthe back end amplifier 1/ f gain fluctuations. This differencing is shown schematically\nin Figure 4.5. Figure 4.7 shows the same power spectra for the combined Gaussian\nnoise, 1/ f gain fluctuations and atmospheric \"1/ f \" fluctuations, and also data taken\nwith OCRA-p on the Toru\u0144 telescope. The simulated timestreams are 5000 seconds in\nduration; the OCRA-p data is 600 seconds long.\nWe note that the simulations currently subtract the 1/ f gain fluctuations from the\n\n126\n\n\f4.2: SIMULATED OCRA-P OBSERVATIONS WITH UMBRELLA\n\nFigure 4.7: Simulated receiver noise power spectra for combined Gaussian, 1/ f and\natmospheric noise (left), and measurements from OCRA-p (right).

This cancellation does not depend on the balance of the\ngain of the two amplifiers, nor the phases of the two phase switch states. Further\nexploration of the source of the 1/ f gain fluctuations in the double-differenced signal\nfrom the amplifiers is needed; it is likely that the cause is not presently included in\nthe simulations. Possibilities include the effects of imbalanced complex gain across\nthe bandwidth of the instrument, or alternatively the isolation between the different\n\n127\n\n\f4: END-TO-END SIMULATIONS OF OCRA\n\nFigure 4.8: Simulated double-differenced receiver noise power spectra after adding\nadditional 1/ f noise into the double-differenced output. Note that the knee frequency\nhere is higher than the value seen from OCRA-p (cf. Figure 4.7).\n\nmodules within the receiver chain. For the purpose of these initial simulations, we\ntherefore add 1/ f noise directly to the double-differenced output, and do not simulate\n1/ f gain fluctuations within the amplifiers purely for computational efficiency at this\nstage of the development of the simulation package. The resulting double-differenced\npower spectrum is shown in Figure 4.8; we use this to represent the combined residuals\nfrom the receiver and atmosphere where the index of the 1/ f \u03b1 power is \u03b1 = 1. The 1/ f\nknee frequency in these simulations is higher than observed with OCRA-p, and hence\nthe results represent conservative estimates of the performance of the receiver.\nThe noise power spectra from the atmosphere simulations show a transition from\nGaussian-dominated to atmosphere-dominated fluctuations in the noise power spectrum at \u223c 0.3 Hz. The wind speed moves the position of the transition in frequency;\nlower wind speeds reduce the frequency (as the atmosphere layer is changing more\nslowly), and faster wind speeds increase the frequency. This agrees well with the transition being determined by the crossing time of the atmosphere across the beam of\nthe telescope, where the fluctuations in the double-differenced signal are caused by\nthe atmosphere in the parts of the beam that do not overlap. The optical depth of\nthe atmosphere, \u03c4, simply scales the entire power spectrum up or down. The level of\nthe temperature fluctuations softens the transition between Gaussian and atmospheredominated noise regimes. The height of the atmosphere layer increases the power\n\n128\n\n\f4.2: SIMULATED OCRA-P OBSERVATIONS WITH UMBRELLA\n\nInput flux density\n1500\n500\n250\n150\n50\n\nGaussian noise\nMean \u00b1 SD Min\n1500 \u00b1 9 1479\n501 \u00b1 4\n491\n250 \u00b1 3\n243\n150\u00b1 3\n144\n51 \u00b1 3\n45\n\nMax\n1522\n509\n257\n158\n57\n\n1/ f noise\nMean \u00b1 SD Min\n1478 \u00b1 71 1341\n508 \u00b1 34\n431\n272 \u00b1 28\n211\n150 \u00b1 22\n94\n126 \u00b1 156\n59\n\nMax\n1664\n616\n358\n211\n1335\n\nTable 4.1: Comparison of input to output point source flux densities from simulated\ncross-scan observations.

Finally, the power spectrum of the atmospheric fluctuations changes the ratio of the power on small scales compared to large scales, but\ndoes not appreciably change the knee frequency. As these parameters need additional\nrefinement and comparison with measurements to reflect more accurately the real atmosphere, we do not use the atmospheric layer simulations further in this chapter.\n\n4.2.2\n\nSimulated cross-scan measurements\n\nWe have carried out 100 simulated cross-scan measurements of point sources for a\nrange of flux densities (1500, 500, 250, 150, 50 and 20 mJy). We use the receiver\nimperfections as described above, and add Gaussian noise only and separately also\nadd 1/ f noise to the double-difference signal. In order to calibrate the measurements,\nwe also perform a cross-scan measurement of a fake NGC 7027 with a flux density of\n5470 mJy. All of the cross-scan measurements are 100 s in duration in elevation and\n200 s in duration in azimuth, which is comparable to actual observations. The results\nfrom the simulations for the various input flux densities are given in Table 4.1.\nWhen only Gaussian noise is present, successful observations of point sources can\nbe made down to a flux density of \u223c 50 mJy. Below this, the 1 s scatter becomes equivalent in size to the signal from the source, and the code used to fit the measurement is\nunable to find the peaks caused by the source. This causes erroneous fits to the data,\nresulting in a large fraction of the measurements being automatically flagged.

In the case of Gaussian noise, the mean measurements are\n1499\u00b19 mJy and 150\u00b13 mJy, where the error is from the scatter on the measurements.\nFor the combined Gaussian and 1/ f noise the measurements are 1477\u00b171 mJy and\n150\u00b122 mJy.

Figure 4.10 provides an example of\na simulated cross-scan measurement of a 250 mJy point source compared with an\nOCRA-p observation of a \u223c 290 mJy point source; there is reasonable agreement\nbetween the two, although with higher noise within the simulations than in the real\ndata. The Gaussian noise level on the double-differenced signal would be expected to\n\u221a\nbe twice the point source sensitivity of the instrument due to factors of 2 for each of\nthe two differences, hence \u223c 12 mJy s1/2 for the OCRA-p receiver (see Section 5.1 for\nmore details). Here the noise is approximately a factor of 2 higher than this due to the\n1/ f gain fluctuations still present within the signal.\nWe conclude that based upon the simulations, cross-scan measurements are suitable\nfor sources stronger than 50-100 mJy, which agrees well with the experience from\nobservations with OCRA-p. The limiting factor here is the analysis software used;\nsmoothing the data over longer time periods might enable the detection of weaker\nsources, although the process of correcting the telescope pointing using the elevation\nscan would be less accurate. An alternative measurement technique for sources weaker\nthan this is used: on-off measurements.\n\n131\n\n\f4: END-TO-END SIMULATIONS OF OCRA\n\nInput flux density\n1500\n500\n250\n150\n50\n20\n10\n5\n1\n\nGaussian noise\nMean \u00b1 SD\nMin\n1463.8 \u00b1 4.6 1452.6\n487.7 \u00b1 2.2\n482.4\n248.0 \u00b1 1.4\n244.4\n149.8 \u00b1 1.2\n146.3\n49.2 \u00b1 1.0\n47.0\n19.9 \u00b1 1.0\n17.4\n9.7 \u00b1 1.0\n7.3\n5.1 \u00b1 1.0\n2.9\n1.0 \u00b1 1.0\n-1.5\n\nMax\n1474.2\n493.7\n251.6\n152.8\n51.3\n23.1\n12.8\n7.7\n3.2\n\n1/ f noise\nMean \u00b1 SD\nMin\n1396.5 \u00b1 52.8 1274.2\n486.8 \u00b1 21.7\n436.1\n235.1 \u00b1 11.5\n213.4\n152.3 \u00b1 9.4\n129.0\n52.9 \u00b1 9.0\n24.9\n19.7 \u00b1 8.6\n-2.3\n11.4 \u00b1 9.1\n-11.6\n3.7 \u00b1 8.1\n-22.2\n1.1 \u00b1 7.7\n-14.9\n\nMax\n1527.8\n539.9\n272.1\n175.2\n74.5\n41.6\n36.0\n20.4\n24.7\n\nTable 4.2: Comparison of input to output point source flux densities from simulated\non-off observations. Flux densities are given in milliJansky.\n\n4.2.3\n\nSimulated on-off measurements\n\nAs with cross-scan measurements, we have performed 100 simulated observations of a\nrange of point sources. As on-off measurements are more sensitive, we simulate 10, 5\nand 1 mJy point source observations in addition to the source flux densities previously\nused. Matching the current observational strategy, we use 30 s measurements of each\nstate, in the order neg-pos-neg-pos-neg-bg-cal. We use symmetric double-differencing\nas the default analysis method. The results from the simulations for the various input\npoint source flux densities are given in Table 4.2.\nWe find that the flux density measurements from the simulated on-off measurements are systematically underestimated by 2.5 per cent as a result of the calibration\nprocess (a 1500 mJy source is measured to be 1463 mJy). This is due to the difference between the Bessel function beam used within these simulations and the fitted\nGaussian curve to the calibration cross-scan measurement of NGC 7027. In reality,\nthe beam will neither be a perfect Gaussian or Bessel function, and typical noise levels\nmake the precise beam shape very difficult to measure. For the weak sources observed\nusing on-off measurements, this difference should also be negligible.\nThe typical error on a simulated on-off measurement with Gaussian noise added is\n\u223c 1.5 mJy. Sources can be detected at any flux density value, either on an individual\n\n132\n\n\f1.7\n\n3.28\n\n1.65\n\n3.26\nOutput signal (arbitrary units)\n\nOutput signal (arbitrary units)\n\n4.2: SIMULATED OCRA-P OBSERVATIONS WITH UMBRELLA\n\n1.6\n1.55\n1.5\n1.45\n1.4\n1.35\n\n3.24\n3.22\n3.2\n3.18\n3.16\n3.14\n3.12\n\n1.3\n\n3.1\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\nTime (s)\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\nTime (s)\n\nFigure 4.11: Simulated (left) and real (right) on-off measurements of a \u223c20 mJy\npoint source.

When 1/ f noise is added, the error on a measurement increases\nto \u223c 3 \u2212 5 mJy, and the uncertainty in the mean measurement is significantly increased.\nHowever, we caution that the estimate used here for the level of the 1/ f noise is overly\npessimistic, as shown by the comparison of the simulated data to real data in Figure\n4.11.\nWhen the observed point source is \u223c 5 mJy, the simulated 1/ f noise starts to cause\nsevere problems, with measurements of \u00b120 mJy present. From 100 measurements of\na 5 mJy point source, the mean was 3.7 mJy from the symmetric double-differencing\nmethod and \u223c3 mJy for the other methods.

The noise on the measurement can, however, be\ndecreased by increasing the number of measurement states.\nWe note, however, that pointing inaccuracies of the telescope are not present within\nthese simulations, which restrict the number of on-off states and the duration of the\nobservations that can be made using OCRA-p on the telescope. As a result, these are\nindicative results requiring further comparison with observations.\n\n4.3\n\nSummary and future work\n\nThe work described in this chapter has focused on setting up the tools to enable highly\nrealistic end-to-end simulations of OCRA-p and OCRA-F. Data reduction software has\nbeen created and linked with the expanded UMBRELLA software, and point source\nobservations using cross-scan and on-off measurements have been simulated.\nThe UMBRELLA software was designed from the start with support for multiple\nreceiver pairs in mind, however the operational code was written to only simulate one\nreceiver pair\u2013OCRA-p. The software has been generalized by the author to work with\nmultiple receiver pairs, requiring the creation of a new data storage class within the\nC++ code, and a modification of the input commands so that multiple receiver chains\ncould be configured. The software has also been modified to read in Virtual Sky maps.\nNow that this simulation software is in place, further work can be carried out by us-\n\n135\n\n\f4: END-TO-END SIMULATIONS OF OCRA\n\ning this software (and also OCRA-p) to test different observational techniques and data\nreduction methods. This includes simulating observations of weaker sources, including the SZ effect, by long integrations. In the case of SZ clusters, it will be important\nto simulate the effects of correcting for the extended nature of these sources, as well as\nthe removal of contaminating point sources.\nThe process of creating maps with the OCRA-F instrument can now be simulated,\nand trials of suitable observation methods for blind surveys for point sources and the SZ\neffect can also be carried out using this software combined with mapping algorithms.\nAdditionally, simulations of measurements of the CMB power spectrum with OCRA-F\ncan also now be carried out, information from which can feed into actual observations\nwith the instrument. When confronting the observational challenges posed by these\nvery weak fields it is vital to understand all the imperfections of the instrument.\nThe software is also now capable of simulating even larger focal plane arrays, however this will consume a large amount of CPU time. In order for this to be achievable\nwithin a reasonable timespan the software needs to be optimized and parallelized so\nthat it can run on multiple processors simultaneously. The simulations can also be\nfurther refined by comparison to more instrumental and observational measurements.\nThese include measurements of the atmosphere using data from water vapour radiometers, further noise power spectra measurements with the OCRA instruments, and potentially also power spectra measurements from the WMAP and Planck spacecraft, as\nthese receivers use very similar technology to that in the OCRA-p and OCRA-F receivers and hence will exhibit characteristic instrumental 1/ f gain fluctuations without\ncontaining atmospheric emission.\nOne of the work packages within the FP7 Radionet APRICOT Join Research Activity will focus on simulations of large linked arrays over the course of the next 2\nyears. The software described here will feed into this project and be developed further\nas a result, including potentially being extended to simulate total power, polarization\nand spectral line observations.\n\n136\n\n\f5\nPoint source observations with\nOCRA-p\nThe OCRA-p receiver has been used to observe a number of point sources from different catalogues since its installation on the 32-m Toru\u0144 telescope in 2003. The receiver\nis best suited for observing known sources, rather than surveying for new ones, as it\nonly has two small (1.2 arcmin) beams to observe with. It is capable of observing\nsources down to the milliJansky level, depending on the weather conditions that it is\nobserving in, as shown by the simulations in Section 4.2.2. The actual observational\ncapabilities of the receiver on the telescope are described in Section 5.1.\nOCRA-p has been used to observe the radio sources within the VSA super-extended\narray fields, which were selected via a blind survey with the Ryle Telescope (RT) at\n15 GHz. It is important to know the flux densities of these sources so that they can\nbe subtracted out from the maps of the CMB produced by the VSA. The results of the\nOCRA-p observations were published in Gawronski et al. (2009). The Author was involve with a number of the elements of data reduction and generation of results within\nthis paper; these are described in more detail in Section 5.2.\nAdditionally, a subsample of 550 of the CRATES sample of flat spectrum radio\nsources (> 65 mJy at 4.85GHz) were also observed. These sources will have significant\n\n137\n\n\f5: POINT SOURCE OBSERVATIONS WITH OCRA-P\n\nflux densities at higher frequencies (compared with steep spectrum sources, which will\nbe much weaker at high frequencies). Knowledge of these sources is important for\nCMB observations by the Planck satellite, which is most sensitive in the area of the\nsky where this subsample has been selected. The selection of the source subsample,\nthe observations and the results are described in Section 5.3.\nThe observations of the VSA and CRATES sources were all reduced using the\nsoftware written by the author and described in Section 4.1; as such, the details of the\ndata reduction methodology are not covered in this chapter.\n\n5.1\n\nCapabilities of the OCRA-p receiver\n\nThe performance of a radio telescope receiver depends on the \"system temperature\"\nT sys (a measure of the Gaussian noise of the receiver-telescope system), the atmospheric temperature, and the bandwidth of the receiver. The standard formula to calculate the sensitivity for the receiver layout used within OCRA-p is\n\u221a\n2k\n2k 2T sys\n\u2206S min =\n\u2206T =\n.\n\u221a\nAeff\nAeff\nB\u03c4\n\n(5.1)\n\nHere, the factor of 2k/Aeff converts between the \"temperature\" sensitivity and the flux\ndensity sensitivity, where k is Boltzmann's Constant and Aeff is the effective collecting\narea of the telescope, which is the combination of the surface area and efficiency. The\nToru\u0144 32 m telescope is \u223c45 per cent efficient at 30 GHz, yielding a conversion factor\nof 0.13 Janskys per Kelvin.\nThe complete system temperature of OCRA-p, including atmospheric emission,\ncan be measured by comparing the signal received when looking at a room temperature\nabsorber with that received when looking at the sky. The difference of this measured\nat the zenith and at 30 degrees elevation measures the atmospheric emission component, and hence the system temperature can be calculated. This measurement of the\nsystem temperature is made routinely with OCRA-p so that the effects of atmospheric\nabsorption can be corrected for in flux density measurements.\n\n138\n\n\f5.1: CAPABILITIES OF THE OCRA-P RECEIVER\n\nSystem temperature without atmospheric contribution (K)\n\n50\n\n45\n\n40\n\n35\n\n30\n\n25\n05/07/01 06/01/01 06/07/01 07/01/01 07/07/01 08/01/01 08/07/01 09/01/01 09/07/01 10/01/01\nDate (YY/MM/DD)\n40\n\nAtmospheric temperature (K)\n\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n05/07/01 06/01/01 06/07/01 07/01/01 07/07/01 08/01/01 08/07/01 09/01/01 09/07/01 10/01/01\nDate (YY/MM/DD)\n\nFigure 5.1: Top: The measured system temperature, excluding the atmospheric contribution, of OCRA-p on the telescope between 2005 and 2009. Bottom: The measured\natmospheric emission temperature at 30 GHz over the same time period. These measurements were taken during astronomical observation periods; as such they have been\ntaken during the best weather at the telescope.\n\n139\n\n\f5: POINT SOURCE OBSERVATIONS WITH OCRA-P\n\nThe system temperature of OCRA-p over time is shown in Figure 5.1; this is fairly\nstable around 30 K over the time period 2005-2009. Figure 5.1 also shows the atmospheric emission temperature at 30 GHz as measured by OCRA-p over the same time\nperiod; this clearly peaks around August each year, with a minimum around April. The\ntypical values for the atmospheric emission are between 10 and 20 K.\nUsing a typical value for the combined receiver and atmospheric temperature of\n40 K, and a bandwidth of 6 GHz, this then yields a sensitivity of 0.7 mK s1/2 , or\n6 mJy s1/2 . This means that a noise level of 1 mJy should be achievable in \u223c 30\nseconds. Note however that this only takes the Gaussian noise into account, and does\nnot include the 1/ f gain fluctuations in the amplifiers nor the 1/ f -like atmospheric\nnoise. These increase the integration times required to reach a given flux density, such\nthat it no longer scales as s\u22120.5 (see Chapter 4). In practice, the error on an individual\non-off measurement with OCRA-p where each state lasts for \u223c 30 s is around 3-5 mJy\n(see later in this Chapter).\n\n5.2\n\nSources in the Very Small Array fields\n\nThe Very Small Array (VSA) was a 33 GHz 14-element interferometer located at\nthe Teide Observatory in Tenerife (Watson et al. 2003). It was used to measure the\nanisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background at a range of angular scales on the\nsky. Three instrumental setups were used: Compact, Extended and Super-Extended,\neach of which probed increasingly smaller angular scales.\nIn order to obtain high accuracy, uncontaminated CMB power spectrum, foreground point sources need to be subtracted out from the data. The VSA had a dedicated source subtracter, a separate interferometer with two 3.7-m dishes separated\nby 9.2 m (see Cleary et al. 2005), which was used during observations with all three\nsetups. However, point sources contaminate smaller angular scales much more than\nlarger scales, such that source subtraction to lower flux densities becomes crucial in\nthe process of measuring the small-scale CMB anisotropies (see Figure 5.2).

The CBI excess (Sievers et al. 2009; discussed in\nSection 3) is also shown (black).\nsuper-extended array configuration, it did not prove possible to use the source subtractor flux densities; instead, measurements by OCRA-p were used. OCRA-p, whilst\nnot as well located as the source subtractor for observations at these frequencies, has\nthe benefits of a much larger collecting area and a wider bandwidth, such that it can\nmeasure the 30 GHz flux densites of the contaminating sources more accurately.\nThe five Super-Extended array fields were first surveyed by the Ryle Telescope\n(RT) at 15 GHz and the sources were identified and followed up by deeper, pointed\nobservations with the RT. OCRA-p was then used to observe the detected sources at\n30 GHz. Data analysis was carried out separately by the Author, M. Gawro\u0144ski and\nK. Lancaster, each using independent data reduction code. Results were compared,\nwith anomalies between the results identified and resolved. The results were published\nin Gawronski et al. (2009). This section describes the data reduction carried out by\n\n141\n\n\f5: POINT SOURCE OBSERVATIONS WITH OCRA-P\n\nthe Author, the comparison of the results to the other two reductions and also with\nprevious measurements of these sources at comparable frequencies. It also discusses\nthe variability and spectra of the sources, the 1.4-30 GHz spectral index distribution at\ndifferent flux densities and the source surface density.\n\n5.2.1\n\nObservations and calibration\n\nThe five fields observed by the VSA in its super-extended configuration were first\nsurveyed by the RT in Cambridge at 15 GHz. These observations (detailed in Waldram\net al. 2009; Gawronski et al. 2009) consisted of a series of raster scans, followed by\npointed observations on each detected source, yielding a list of point sources complete\nto 7 mJy, and with an error on each measurement of 5 per cent due to calibration.\nDue to the pointed observations, the thermal noise of the measurements is negligible\ncompared with the calibration uncertainty.\nThe 121 detected sources were then observed at 30 GHz with OCRA-p between\n10 February 2007 and 28 May 2008, with some follow-up measurements taken on\n12\u201313 January 2009 to complete the sample and to check for variability. A list of\nthe observing sessions is given in Table 5.1. The sources were observed using the onoff method (described in Section 4.1.2); the exact pattern of these observations evolved\nover the observations, as described in Table 5.1. All measurements were reduced using\nthe symmetric double difference method regardless of the observational pattern. This\nwas due to the increased ability of this method to remove the effects of linear drifts in\nthe signal compared to the standard double-differencing method, even though this does\nnot necessarily use all of the recorded data.\nThe planetary nebula NGC 7027 was used for primary flux density calibration,\nand was observed at least once per day during the VSA source observations. This\nis the brightest planetary nebula in the radio sky. At 33 GHz, Hafez et al. (2008)\nreport a flux density of 5.39 \u00b1 0.04 Jy at an epoch of 2003.0 with a secular decrease of\n\u22120.17\u00b10.03 per cent. Extrapolating this to 2008.0 yields a flux density of 5.34\u00b10.04 Jy,\n\n142\n\n\f5.2: SOURCES IN THE VERY SMALL ARRAY FIELDS\n\nEpoch\n1\n2\n\nDate\n10-11 February 2007*\n16-19 February 2007\n23-28 March 2007\n26-27 April 2007\n3-5 May 2007*\n8 June 2007\n16-18 July 2007\n\n3\n\n16, 24-25, 29 September 2007*\n13-16 October 2007\n\n4\n\n13, 15, 29 December 2007\n2, 4, 5, 11* January 2008\n24 April 2008\n6, 9, 28 May 2008\n12-13 January 2009\n\n5\n6\n\nFormat\n+ \u2013 + \u2013 cal +\n\u2013 + \u2013 + cal\nbg \u2013 + \u2013 bg + cal\nbg \u2013 + \u2013 bg cal\nbg \u2013 + \u2013 + bg cal\nbg \u2013 + \u2013 + bg cal\nbg \u2013 + \u2013 + bg cal\nbg \u2013 + \u2013 + bg cal\n\u2013 + \u2013 + \u2013 bg cal\n\u2013 + \u2013 + \u2013 bg cal\n\u2013 + \u2013 + cal\n\u2013 + \u2013 + \u2013 bg cal\n\u2013 + \u2013 + \u2013 bg cal\n\u2013 + \u2013 + \u2013 bg cal\n\u2013 + \u2013 + \u2013 bg cal\n\u2013 + \u2013 + \u2013 bg cal\n\u2013 + \u2013 + \u2013 bg cal\n\nTable 5.1: Dates of measurements of the VSA sources, and the method of the onoff scans that was used.

(2008).\nA noise diode is used for secondary flux density calibration of the observations.\nThe ratio of outputs obtained with cross-scans of NGC 7027 and the noise diode are\naveraged for a 24 hour period; this diode calibration is then applied to the individual\nmeasurements.\nAdditionally, observations were made of a pointing calibrator per field. These\nsources are the same as those used for flux density calibration by the RT/AMI collaboration in their measurements of the sources at 15GHz. The calibrators (listed in Table\n5.2) were observed every 30-45 minutes (or every 5-6 on-off measurements) during\nthe observations, and were used solely to calibrate the pointing of the telescope; flux\n\n143\n\n\f5: POINT SOURCE OBSERVATIONS WITH OCRA-P\n\nName\nNGC 7027\nJ0015+3216\nB0012+3159\nJ0245+2405\nB0242+238\nJ0958+3224\nB0955+3238\nJ1219+4829\nB1216+4847\nJ1521+4336\nB1520+4347\n\nPosition (J2000)\n21h 07m 51.1s\n+42d 10m 27.8s\n00h 15m 06.2s\n+32d 16m 12.7s\n02h 45m 16.8s\n+24d 05m 35.2s\n09h 58m 20.9s\n+32d 24m 02.2s\n12h 19m 06.4s\n+48d 29m 56.4s\n15h 21m 49.6s\n+43d 36m 39.6s\n\nFlux density (mJy)\n5470 \u00b1 40\n(Hafez et al. 2008)\n277 \u00b1 24\n\nNotes\nPrimary calibrator\nPosition calibrator, field 1L\n\n249 \u00b1 22\n\nPosition calibrator, field 5E\n\n635 \u00b1 54\n\nPosition calibrator, field 2G\n\n643 \u00b1 54\n\nPosition calibrator, field 7E\n\n415 \u00b1 36\n\nPosition calibrator, field 3L\n\nTable 5.2: The calibrator sources observed during the VSA source measurements,\nalong with their coordinates (as observed), flux densities (either referenced or the mean\nfrom the measurements, excluding calibration errors) and notes on their use within\nthese observations.\ndensity calibration was carried out using the noise diode.\nThe change of the telescope gain with elevation was corrected for using a fit to\nobservations of NGC 7027 made over a wide range of elevations (A. Kus, private communication), using Equation 4.15. Atmospheric absorption is corrected for using measurements of the system temperature at the zenith and 60 degrees from zenith made at\nregular intervals during the observations. A simple \"flat earth\" model in which the atmosphere is assumed to be a continuous slab with constant thickness and optical depth\nwas used; see Equation 4.18. See Section 4.1.3 for more details about the calibration\nprocess.\n\n5.2.2\n\nData quality\n\nFlagging of bad data\nIn order to produce accurate flux density measurements, bad data must be removed\nwhere possible. This was done both automatically and manually, depending on the\ncriteria described below. In total, 1350 measurements were made of the VSA sources,\n\n144\n\n\f5.2: SOURCES IN THE VERY SMALL ARRAY FIELDS\n\n90\n80\nElevation (degrees)\n\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\nAzimuth (degrees)\n\nFigure 5.3: The azimuth and elevation of the telescope for all of the VSA source\nmeasurements. Measurements taken below the red line (30 degree elevation) were\nautomatically flagged. The tracks of the 5 source fields, and some of the calibration\nsources, can clearly be seen.\n\nof which 336 measurements (25 per cent) were flagged, leaving 1014 good measurements (on average, 8.3 measurements per source). This flagging is due to atmospheric\neffects, calibration and telescope pointing issues.\nCalibrator measurements where the ratio of the amplitudes and widths of the crossscans were less than 0.8 or greater than 1 / 0.8 were automatically flagged, as was any\nmeasurement taken with an elevation angle of less than 30 degrees (see Figure 5.3).\nThe calibration scans were also checked through manually, and any which visually\nappeared to be bad were manually flagged. Cross-scan measurements where the azimuth scan had a significantly lower intensity than the elevation scan were also flagged.\nAny measurements with an obviously erroneous calibration diode measurement (e.g.\nthe calibration diode measurement was the same intensity as the background) were\nremoved.\n\n145\n\n\f5: POINT SOURCE OBSERVATIONS WITH OCRA-P\n\nIndividual on-off measurements were removed automatically where the error on the\nmeasurement was greater than 7 mJy, and manually where they had been flagged by\nthe observer or the measurement had an anomalously low flux density for that source,\nsomething that would indicate problems with the telescope pointing during the measurement.\nAll measurements from 10-11 February 2007 were removed due to bad weather,\nand measurements taken between 16 and 24 September 2007 as well as those taken on\n11 January 2008 were flagged due to technical issues with the receiver. Finally, data\nfrom 3-5 May 2007 were removed as NGC 7027 was not observed during that session,\nand there was a large jump in the output voltages from OCRA-p.\nLong time period variations in receiver\nDue to changes in the relative gains of the two receiver arms over time (including the\ncorrection applied to bring them to the same level prior to the double-difference stage),\nthe raw double-difference voltages from the measurements can vary substantially over\ntime, and over the course of the VSA source measurements they decreased by a factor\nof 2. This should be effectively removed by calibration. Figure 5.4 shows the fractional difference in the voltage and calibrated flux densities for the measurements of\nthe secondary calibrator sources compared with the mean value for those sources. The\nsystematic decrease in the voltage is evident in the top figure, but post-calibration it\nhas effectively been removed.\nThe flux densities of two sources, however, increase over time post-calibration.\nJ1521+4336 increases from \u223c 350 mJy to \u223c 600 mJy, and J1219+4829 from \u223c\n600 mJy to \u223c 1 Jy. As these were secondary calibrators, and weren't used for flux\ndensity calibration, this does not present any issues for the other measurements. Additionally, 3C286, which was also observed during the VSA source observations, displays apparent variability, something that is expected as it is \u223c 12 per cent polarized at\n1.3 cm (Perley & Taylor 2003) and OCRA-p is sensitive to a single linear polarization.\n\n146\n\n\f5.2: SOURCES IN THE VERY SMALL ARRAY FIELDS\n\n0.8\n\n(V-Vbar) / Vbar\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.6\n-0.8\n54100 54200 54300 54400 54500 54600 54700 54800 54900\nRJD\nCaldiode\nNGC7027\nJ0015+3216\n\nJ0245+2405\nJ1219+4829\n3C286\n\nJ1521+4336\nJ0958+3224\n\n0.8\n\n(Jy-Jybar) / Jybar\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.6\n54100 54200 54300 54400 54500 54600 54700 54800 54900\nRJD\nCaldiode\nNGC7027\nJ0015+3216\n\nJ0245+2405\nJ1219+4829\n3C286\n\nJ1521+4336\nJ0958+3224\n\nFigure 5.4: The top plot shows the difference between individual measurements minus\nthe mean measurement of that source, divided by the mean measurement of that source,\nfor all of the primary and secondary calibrators, as well as the calibrator diode and\n3C286, in volts.

Following these, a series of points are displaced\nby 1 timestep, before a data point is missed out and the displacement ends. An example\nof this can be seen in Figure 5.5. The cause of this is lags within the network system at\nToru\u0144; the measurement files are transmitted over the computer network to the control\nsystem, where they are tagged with the time and saved. When a measurement does\nnot reach the control system in time, the previous value is recorded in its place. Due\nto the irregularity of this effect, and the varying time before the displacement ends,\nthis effect cannot easily be corrected for. However, the effect of this on the fits to the\nmeasurements are negligible. The problem will be resolved for the system used for\nOCRA-F.\n\n148\n\n\f5.2: SOURCES IN THE VERY SMALL ARRAY FIELDS\n\n5.2.3\n\nFlux density values\n\nThe source names and J2000.0 positions at 15 GHz for each of the VSA super-extended\narray fields are listed in Table 5.3\u20135.7, along with their flux densities at 15 GHz from\nthe RT observations and at 30 GHz from the OCRA-p observations from the Author's\nreduction of the data. We find flux densities for the sources at 1.4 and 4.8 GHz from\nthe NVSS (Condon et al. 1998)1 and GB6 (Gregory et al. 1996)2 catalogues per the\ndescription in Gawronski et al. (2009). We calculate the two-point 1.4 to 30 GHz\nspectral index for the sources, defined such that S \u03bd \u221d \u03bd\u03b1 . Sources marked with a 'v'\nin the note column are thought to be variable on the basis of the 30 GHz observations\n(see Section 5.2.4), and those marked with an 'e' are extended in FIRST maps (Becker\net al. 1995; see Section 6.4 of Gawronski et al. 2009). Notes on individual sources\nmarked with a * are given in the Appendix of Gawronski et al. (2009).\nA significant number of measurements had to be discarded due to adverse effects of\npoor weather. Each source was observed multiple times, with individual measurements\nwith large fit errors removed, giving an average of 8.3 observations per source. The\nfinal flux density for the source was calculated using the 1/\u03c32 weighted mean and\ncorresponding standard error on the mean (\u03c3w ), with the errors on each measurement\ncalculated as per Equation 4.8.\nThe combined uncertainty from the combination of the calibration, atmospheric\nand gain-elevation corrections and atmospheric effects is \u223c 8 per cent. The systematic error due to the error in the flux calibrator, NGC 7027, is negligible at 1\nper cent. As such, the final errors on the 30 GHz flux densities are calculated by\np\n\u03c3 = \u03c32w + (0.08S )2 .\nComparison to other reductions\nTo ensure the maximum reliability of the results for the VSA sources, the observations\nwere reduced separately at the three institutions involved in the OCRA collaboration.\n1\n2\n\nAccessed via http://www.cv.nrao.edu/nvss/\nAccessed via http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/gb6.html\n\n149\n\n\fName\nJ0011+2830\nJ0011+2811\nJ0011+2757\nJ0012+2821\nJ0012+2829\nJ0013+2819\nJ0013+2834\nJ0014+2845\nJ0014+2821\nJ0014+2848\n(J0014+2852a)\n(J0014+2852b)\nJ0014+2815\nJ0015+2906\nJ0015+2831\nJ0015+2819\nJ0015+2843\nJ0015+2718\nJ0016+2804\nJ0017+2733\nJ0017+2750\nJ0017+2835\nJ0017+2736\nJ0018+2749\nJ0018+2843\nJ0018+2846\nJ0018+2731\nJ0018+2801\nJ0018+2744\nJ0019+2817\n\nRA (J2000)\n00 11 46.71\n00 11 50.57\n00 11 51.72\n00 12 01.34\n00 12 44.44\n00 13 28.04\n00 13 32.68\n00 14 14.80\n00 14 16.75\n00 14 24.78\n00 14 27.74\n00 14 33.14\n00 14 33.84\n00 15 13.97\n00 15 15.45\n00 15 36.64\n00 15 42.48\n00 15 58.02\n00 16 02.36\n00 17 04.58\n00 17 23.77\n00 17 32.50\n00 17 59.94\n00 18 09.49\n00 18 11.99\n00 18 12.78\n00 18 32.72\n00 18 42.15\n00 18 58.17\n00 19 08.97\n\nDec (J2000)\n28 30 23.1\n28 11 08.4\n27 57 18.3\n28 21 47.1\n28 29 09.5\n28 19 49.5\n28 34 48.8\n28 45 50.9\n28 21 09.3\n28 48 44.3\n28 52 26.8\n28 52 05.1\n28 15 05.3\n29 06 13.0\n28 31 53.4\n28 19 22.9\n28 43 39.8\n27 18 53.8\n28 04 27.4\n27 33 42.3\n27 50 27.5\n28 35 12.4\n27 36 16.1\n27 49 24.5\n28 43 56.0\n28 46 37.6\n27 31 02.9\n28 01 07.9\n27 44 45.5\n28 17 54.6\n\nS 1.4 (mJy)\n128.8 \u00b1 3.9\n10.0 \u00b1 0.5\n<1.5\n8.4 \u00b1 0.5\n36.8 \u00b1 1.2\n48.6 \u00b1 1.5\n39.8 \u00b1 1.3\n49.4 \u00b1 2.1\n263.0 \u00b1 7.9\n19.7 \u00b1 0.7\n19.1 \u00b1 1.0\n6.8 \u00b1 0.5\n96.0 \u00b1 2.9\n10.6 \u00b1 0.5\n3.7 \u00b1 1.0\n7.1 \u00b1 0.5\n35.7 \u00b1 1.1\n2.1 \u00b1 1.5\n50.2 \u00b1 1.6\n11.5 \u00b1 0.5\n302.0 \u00b1 10.7\n82.8 \u00b1 2.5\n72.8 \u00b1 2.2\n6.2 \u00b1 0.4\n17.9 \u00b1 0.7\n153.7 \u00b1 5.3\n150.8 \u00b1 4.5\n7.5 \u00b1 1.0\n144.3 \u00b1 4.3\n24.7 \u00b1 0.8\n\nS 4.8 (mJy)\n36 \u00b1 5\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n23 \u00b1 4\n32 \u00b1 5\n\u2013\n56 \u00b1 6\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n135 \u00b1 12\n20 \u00b1 4\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n20 \u00b1 4\n\u2013\n88 \u00b1 8\n35 \u00b1 5\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n54 \u00b1 6\n57 \u00b1 6\n\u2013\n42 \u00b1 5\n\u2013\n\nS 15 (mJy)\n8.8\n3.6\n6.0\n6.2\n4.4\n8.4\n23.8\n4.6\n12.1\n2.6\n5.5\n5.4\n45.1\n5.6\n3.0\n2.5\n7.5\n3.1\n2.7\n6.2\n20.9\n9.3\n4.7\n10.4\n11.1\n15.0\n21.2\n3.7\n10.0\n32.6\n\nS 30 (mJy)\n4.6 \u00b1 1.0\n-3.7 \u00b1 1.6\n3.8 \u00b1 0.9\n-0.2 \u00b1 0.7\n4.5 \u00b1 1.4\n3.7 \u00b1 1.6\n14.7 \u00b1 2.1\n0.9 \u00b1 1.6\n1.1 \u00b1 1.8\n0.6 \u00b1 3.3\n3.1 \u00b1 1.1\n5.4 \u00b1 1.0\n27.8 \u00b1 2.7\n6.3 \u00b1 1.3\n4.5 \u00b1 2.2\n1.6 \u00b1 1.5\n6.0 \u00b1 1.9\n-2.5 \u00b1 1.4\n2.1 \u00b1 2.4\n2.9 \u00b1 1.8\n11.3 \u00b1 1.9\n5.7 \u00b1 2.2\n3.8 \u00b1 1.4\n6.4 \u00b1 2.0\n5.0 \u00b1 1.2\n9.5 \u00b1 2.0\n11.3 \u00b1 1.9\n1.5 \u00b1 2.5\n3.4 \u00b1 1.5\n28.0 \u00b1 4.0\n\n\u03b130\n1.4\n+0.08\n-1.09\u22120.09\n< \u22120.7\n\u2013\n< \u22120.4\n+0.10\n-0.68\u22120.13\n< \u22120.5\n+0.05\n-0.32\u22120.06\n< \u22120.7\n< \u22121.2\n< \u22120.2\n< \u22120.3\n+0.08\n-0.09\u22120.10\n+0.04\n-0.40\u22120.04\n+0.08\n-0.17\u22120.09\n< 1.5\n< 0.0\n+0.10\n-0.58\u22120.13\n< 0.4\n< \u22120.5\n< \u22120.1\n+0.06\n-1.07\u22120.07\n< \u22120.6\n-1.0+0.1\n\u22120.2\n0.0+0.1\n\u22120.1\n+0.09\n-0.42\u22120.11\n+0.07\n-0.91\u22120.09\n+0.06\n-0.85\u22120.07\n< 0.2\n< \u22120.9\n0.04+0.05\n\u22120.06\n\n150\nv\n\nv\n\n*\n*\n\nv\n\nNote\n\nTable 5.3: Sources in the 1L VSA field, centered on J00 16 09.1, +28 16 40.

Gawro\u0144ski (Toru\u0144), and K. Lancaster (Bristol). The results agree well,\nwith no systematic differences between the analyses. There is some scatter due to the\nslightly different implementations of the data reduction processes, particularly between\nthe Author's and K. Lancaster's reductions. However this scatter is not significant\ncompared with the error on the measurements.\n\n5.2.4\n\nComparison with previous measurements and source variability\n\nThe stronger sources (> 10mJy at 15 GHz) within the 33 extended VSA fields were\nobserved during the initial VSA campaign at 33 GHz using the VSA source subtractor,\nwith those greater than 20 mJy at 33 GHz used for direct subtraction from the CMB\ndata (Dickinson et al. 2004). A subsample of these was published by Cleary et al.\n(2005, 2008). The flux densities measured by the source subtractor for the sources in\nCleary et al. (2005, 2008) that also lie within the super-extended array fields, as well as\nmeasurements of those sources made at a range of frequencies by Bolton et al. (2004)\nand Waldram et al. (2007) using the Very Large Array, are listed in Table 5.8 along\nwith the measurements by the RT and OCRA. A number of the sources show evidence\nof variability.\nWe note that OCRA-p is only sensitive to a single linear polarization, which could\nresult in discrepancies between measurements from the VSA, VLA and OCRA for\npolarized sources; however these are likely to be small since the WMAP sources selected at 22 GHz (see Jackson et al. 2009) exhibit average linear polarizations of \u223c3\nper cent. Assuming that the polarization percentages of the VSA sources are similar\nto the WMAP sources, then the effects of such low polarization would not be noticed.\nThe sources observed with the higher resolution interferometers (RT and VLA) may\nalso be slightly resolved. Nevertheless we identify at least four sources (J0013+2834;\nJ1538+4225; J1541+4114; J0019+2817) as likely to be intrinsically variable.

There is clear evidence of bimodality, with a split\naround a spectral index of -0.5, dividing the sources into groups of sources with 'flat'\nand 'steep' spectra.\nThe distribution is markedly different from the 1.4 to 30 GHz spectral index distribution presented by Mason et al. (2009). However, their source sample was selected at\n1.4 GHz rather than 15 GHz as in this paper. The distribution in Mason et al. (2009)\nis not bimodal, but has a single peak around \u22121.0, implying that their sample is dominated by the steep spectrum sources. Our sample contains a larger fraction of flat and\nrising spectrum sources. This is not surprising given the difference of a factor ten in\nthe sample selection frequency.\n\n5.2.6\n\nThe 1.4-30 GHz spectral index distribution vs flux density\n\nWe are seeking to improve our knowledge of the source population at 30 GHz down\nto mJy flux densities and beyond (by extrapolation). In order to extrapolate one needs\nto know if there is a dependence of the spectral properties of the population on flux\ndensity at 30 GHz. We have therefore used the WMAP 5-year point source catalogue\n(Wright et al. 2009) to select a complete strong source sample consisting of all sources\nwith a 22 GHz flux above 1 Jy. We have then cross-identified these with the NVSS\ncatalogue and calculated the spectral index distribution between 1.4 and 33 GHz. We\nchose 22 GHz as the selection frequency to be as close as possible to the 15 GHz\nselection frequency used in the present work.\nIn this analysis, we exclude sources that are known to be extended on scales greater\nthan \u223c 30 arcmin (WMAP J0322-3711/Fornax A; WMAP J1633+8226/NGC 6251) or\nconfused in WMAP (WMAP J0223+4303/3C66 A and B). Sources are matched to\nsingle NVSS sources, except for WMAP J0108+1319/3C33 where four close NVSS\n\n160\n\n\fNumber of sources in bin (complete at 15GHz)\n\n5.2: SOURCES IN THE VERY SMALL ARRAY FIELDS\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n-1.5\n\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\nSpectral index between 1.4 and 30 GHz\n\n1\n\nFigure 5.10: The distribution of spectral indices between 1.4 and 30 GHz (\u03b130\n1.4 ) for 60\nsources in this sample with a 15 GHz flux density greater than 7 mJy. 3\u03c3 detections\nat 30 GHz are shown in the light grey histogram; the dark grey histogram contains the\n3\u03c3 upper limits on the spectral indices.\nsources are combined. In total, 211 sources are used in the analysis. Figure 5.11 shows\nthe spectral index distribution, which has a single peak centered on zero. All but 16\nsources are classified as flat spectrum, i.e. have \u03b1 > \u22120.5. As expected, this is also\nvery different to the distribution found by Mason et al. (2009), which is dominated by\nsteep spectrum sources.\nThere is no evidence for a large population of steep spectrum sources in the WMAP\nspectral index distribution. This contrasts with the VSA source distribution shown\nin Figure 5.10 where there is evidence for both flat and steep spectrum populations\nof comparable size. This difference could be ascribed to the selection frequencies\n(22 GHz cf. 15 GHz), however their closeness suggests that this should not be a major\nissue. Another consideration is that although we are selecting using the 22 GHz flux\ndensities, in reality the WMAP point source catalogue is obtained using all of the bands\n(Wright et al. 2009). This should also not be an issue as the sources with 22 GHz\n\n161\n\n\f5: POINT SOURCE OBSERVATIONS WITH OCRA-P\n\n50\n\nNumber of sources in bin\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n-1.5\n\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\nSpectral index between 1.4 and 33 GHz\n\n1\n\nFigure 5.11: The spectral index distribution of 22 GHz-selected WMAP sources between 1.4 and 33 GHz. The majority of sources have flat spectra (\u03b1 > \u22120.5).\nflux density greater than 1 Jy are detected by WMAP at high significance. A final\npossibility, which we think is most likely, is that the dissimilar distributions are due\nto the difference in the flux densities of the sources in the samples. The population of\nsteep spectrum sources increases as the flux densities decrease.\nSuch an effect is also seen in Waldram et al. (2009), where they find a significant\nchange in spectral index distribution with flux density amongst their 15 GHz selected\nsources. We note, however, that there is some overlap in sources between their samples\nand the one studied here.\nThe bimodality of the spectral index distribution remains the same when the sources\nin the present sample are selected at 30 GHz. The left hand part of Figure 5.12 shows\nthe spectral index distribution of the VSA sources selected to be complete at 30 GHz\n(S 30 > 10 mJy), and the right hand part shows the spectral indices of WMAP sources\nselected to be greater than 1 Jy at 33 GHz.

The\ndarker boxes represent sources with flux density between 10 and 20 mJy at 30 GHz;\nthe lighter boxes represent the sources with greater than 20 mJy at 30 GHz. The distribution of the stronger sources closely resembles that of the WMAP sample. Right:\nThe spectral index distribution between 1.4 and 33 GHz of WMAP sources selected to\nbe stronger than 1 Jansky at 33 GHz. The distribution is essentially the same as for the\n22 GHz selected sample, but with slightly fewer sources with spectral indices between\n0 and -1.\ndensity sources have a spectral index distribution closer to the WMAP distribution; the\nlower flux density sources become increasingly more steep spectrum. A KolmogorovSmirnov comparison of the VSA (S 30 > 10 mJy) and WMAP distributions shows that\nthe samples are different at the 95 per cent confidence level. The semi-empirical model\ndescribed by de Zotti et al. (2005) predicts a cross-over between the dominance of flat\nand steep spectrum sources at about 30 mJy (their Figure 14). Our observations display\na sharper cross-over than the models appear to suggest, and at the slightly lower flux\ndensity of 20 mJy, but are otherwise consistent with the predictions by de Zotti et al.\n(2005).\n\n5.2.7\n\nComparison of estimates of source surface densities at 30 GHz\n\nThere are 31 sources in the five VSA fields detected above 10 mJy at 30 GHz.

The blue data points are from the\nWMAP 5 year survey (Wright et al. 2009), the pink data points from the Very Small\nArray (Cleary et al. 2005) and the turquoise point from the OCRA observations of the\nsources in the VSA fields, between 10 and 20 mJy. The OCRA point agrees with the\nmodel within the 1\u03c3 error bars.\ndensity of sources is thus 2.0 \u00b1 0.4 sources per square degree (using the Poissonian\nerror), which can be compared with the extrapolated value of 2.65 \u00b1 0.1 in Mason et al.\n(2009). Coble et al. (2007) also give an estimate of the surface density of 30 GHz\nsources in the field, which gives 2.2+2.5\n\u22121.2 sources per square degree; they also point out\nthat the density of sources in clusters of galaxies is significantly higher. Figure 5.13\nshows the differential source counts at 30 GHz from WMAP and VSA observations,\nas well as the differential source count for the sources in this sample between 10 and\n20 mJy. The model of Toffolatti et al. (1998) is also shown, normalized by 0.7 (see\nSection 2.6.1). The OCRA data point is consistent with the model within the 1\u03c3 error\nbars.\n\n164\n\n\f5.2: SOURCES IN THE VERY SMALL ARRAY FIELDS\n\n5.2.8\n\nConclusions\n\nIn order to aid the subtraction of individual sources from the VSA fields observed\nat \u223c30 GHz, and to obtain a statistical estimate of the surface density of sources at\n30 GHz, we have observed a sample of 121 sources using the OCRA-p receiver on the\nToru\u0144 32 m telescope; the sample was selected at 15 GHz with the RT. At 30 GHz,\nwe detected 57 sources above a limiting flux density of \u223c 5 mJy. This is the deepest\nfollow-up of any complete sample of sources detected at 15 GHz by the RT.\nAt a flux density of 10 mJy, which is our estimated completeness limit, we derive a\nsurface density of sources at 30 GHz of 2.0 \u00b1 0.4 per square degree. This is consistent\nwith the value obtained by Mason et al. (2009), who observed a much larger sample\nof sources down to mJy levels but selected at a much lower frequency (1.4 GHz). The\npotential danger of using low frequency selected samples is that there may exist a\nsignificant population of sources with steeply rising spectra towards high frequencies\nthat are not present in the low frequency surveys. As the two surface density estimates\nare consistent, this indicates that such a population is not obviously present at the\n10 mJy level.\nWe have compared our flux density measurements with those from the VSA source\nsubtractor and VLA measurements. These comparisons give confidence in our flux\nscale but reveal that a significant fraction of sources are variable on a timescale of\na few years, some at the level of a factor of 2. This shows the importance of taking\ncontemporaneous measurements of discrete sources in conjunction with measurements\nof the CMB.\nWe have also investigated the dependence of the spectral index distribution on\nflux density by comparing our measured spectral index distribution with that for much\nstronger sources (above 1 Jy) selected from the WMAP 22 GHz catalogue. We conclude that the proportion of steep spectrum sources increases with decreasing flux density. This is qualitatively consistent with models of source populations, for example de\nZotti et al. (2005).\n\n165\n\n\f5: POINT SOURCE OBSERVATIONS WITH OCRA-P\n\n5.3\n\nCRATES source sample\n\nThe Combined Radio All-sky Targeted Eight GHz Survey (CRATES; Healey et al.\n2007) is an all sky sample of strong flat spectrum sources at 8.4 GHz. In the northern\nhemisphere the sample was selected from the 4.85 GHz GB6 catalogue (Gregory et al.\n1996) compared with 1.4 GHz fluxes from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS; Condon et al. 1998); it is essentially a subset of the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey (CLASS;\nMyers et al. 2003b; Browne et al. 2003). CRATES combines other surveys for the\nsouthern hemisphere, as well as at declinations above 75\u25e6 where GB6 is incomplete.\nCRATES is currently the most complete large-area high frequency weak point source\nsample existing prior to observations by Planck; it has flux densities lower by over an\norder of magnitude than the WMAP source sample (Wright et al. 2009). Efforts to\nimprove its completeness are ongoing (Healey et al. 2009).\nThe sample was originally selected to study blazars \u2013 radio-loud Active Galactic\nNuclei where we are looking down the jet axis. This angle of observation means that\nthe sources are doppler boosted such that their received flux densities are increased.\nThe knowledge of the high frequency flux densities of these sources has several\nuses. Knowledge of the spectra of the sources is of use for investigations of the physics\nbehind the sources. Higher frequency follow-ups are a possibility, and in the long term\nsurveys with SCUBA2 will likely also detect some of these sources at high frequencies\n(300 GHz+), thus giving excellent spectral energy distributions.\nThe sources contained in CRATES are also the most likely ones to contaminate\nPlanck measurements of the CMB. Planck will be most sensitive at the north ecliptic\npole, hence this is the most logical place to observe a sub-sample of the CRATES\nsources. Potentially, the source flux density list could be used for subtraction from\nthe 30 GHz LFI maps, and for cross-comparison with the source lists generated by\nPlanck HFI. It would also be useful to know whether the sources will contaminate HFI\nmeasurements at 100, 143 and 217 GHz. This would require high-frequency follow-up\nobservations.\n\n166\n\n\f5.3: CRATES SOURCE SAMPLE\n\n80\n\nDeclination (degrees)\n\n60\n40\n20\n0\n-20\n-40\n-60\n-80\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n22\n\n24\n\nRA (hours)\n\nFigure 5.14: The distribution of CRATES sources in RA and Dec. The complete\nCRATES sample is shown in black. The sample observed by OCRA is shown in red.\nThe cluster of sources in the bottom-left is the Large Magellanic Cloud, and the gap\naround Dec 0\u25e6 are where there are gaps in the 4.8 GHz observation coverage (Healey\net al. 2007). The reduced number of sources above 75\u25e6 is caused by the upper limit in\nthe GB6 observations.\nOCRA has previously been used to observe the Caltech-Jodrell Bank flat-spectrum\n(CJF) sample, a set of 293 strong (>350 mJy at 4.85 GHz) flat spectrum radio sources;\nthe observation of these by OCRA-p is described in Lowe et al. (2007) and Lowe\n(2006). A survey of a sample of CRATES sources essentially extends this work to\nlower flux densities. OCRA-F will follow up this work by doing a wide area blind\nsurvey to reasonable flux densities (\u223c10 mJy) in this part of the sky.\n\n5.3.1\n\nSubsample selection\n\nThe CRATES sample consists of extragalactic sources (|b| > 10\u25e6 ) that have spectral\nindices between 1.4 and 4.8 GHz of \u03b1 > \u22120.5, and have 4.8 GHz fluxes greater than\n65 mJy. These limits yield 11 000 sources in the complete sample. The subsample\n\n167\n\n\f5: POINT SOURCE OBSERVATIONS WITH OCRA-P\n\nobserved with OCRA have a series of additional selection criteria. We require that the\nsources:\n\u2022 are closer than 33 degrees from the North Ecliptic Pole (located at RA 18h, dec\n66.5 degrees),\n\u2022 have a declination of less than 75 degrees (the GB6 survey limit),\n\u2022 are no closer than 15 degrees to the galactic plane (|b| > 15), and\n\u2022 have a measured 8.4 GHz flux density\nThis selection yields 693 sources. However, the CRATES catalog includes smallscale components within single sources, which are unobservable with the \u223c 1 arcmin\nOCRA beam. For sources with multiple components closer together than an arcmin\nwe add their 8.4 GHz flux densities together. The position of the brightest component\nis used as the position of the source. The final source list contains 550 sources - a\nnumber that is feasible to observe with OCRA-p.\nThe RA range of the source sample is 10h 27m to 22h 6m ; the declination range is\nfrom 33\u25e6 51m to 75\u25e6 . The 550 CRATES sources within this sample are shown in red in\nFigure 5.14, with all of the CRATES sources shown in black.\n\n5.3.2\n\nObservations\n\nThe observations were carried out using a mixture of cross-scans and on-off measurements, depending on the expected strength of the source based on an extrapolation from\nthe 4.8 and 8.4 GHz flux densities. Those sources that were predicted to be stronger\nthan 100 mJy were observed from the start using cross-scan measurements; those that\nwere expected to be weaker than that were observed using on-off measurements. If\na source was not detected using the cross-scan method, then it was re-observed using on-off measurements. As cross-scan measurements provide simultaneous pointing\ncorrections for the telescope, these provide more robust flux density measurements;\n\n168\n\n\f5.3: CRATES SOURCE SAMPLE\n\n90\n80\nElevation (degrees)\n\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\nAzimuth (degrees)\n\nFigure 5.15: The azimuth and elevation of the telescope during all of the CRATES\nsource measurements.\n\nhowever on-off measurements are required for sources with a low flux density. In the\ncase of these sources, the pointing corrections from nearby strong sources observed\nwith cross-scan measurements can be used. This combination of the two observational\ntechniques provides the most reliable flux density measurements from the OCRA-p\ninstrument.\nObservations commenced in November 2008. The majority of the observations\nwere complete by October 2009, with only a few sources remaining for further observations. This section describes the results as of mid-December 2009. A total of 3597\nmeasurements were made by this date \u2013 an average of 6.5 measurements per source,\nwith each source having at least 3 measurements. Objects with interesting spectra or\ndiscrepant flux density measurements are currently being reobserved. The observation\npositions in azimuth and elevation are shown in Figure 5.15.\n\n169\n\n\f5: POINT SOURCE OBSERVATIONS WITH OCRA-P\n\n5.3.3\n\nData quality\n\nObservations from several periods \u2013 namely, 30 March, 2-3 April, 18 April and 2930 April 2009 \u2013 were flagged in their entirety due to calibration problems. Some\nshorter periods were also flagged, where the measurements following from a pointing\ncalibration were systematically above or below the mean flux density for those sources.\nCross-scan measurements where the amplitudes of the peaks disagree by greater\nthan 20 per cent, or where the widths of the peaks disagree by greater than 40 per cent,\nare automatically flagged. Measurements that are obviously affected by poor weather\nhave then been manually flagged.\nAlthough for the VSA sources all on-off measurements with an error on the measurement over 7 mJy were automatically flagged, this does not work as well for the\nCRATES sources due to their stronger flux densities. As such, we automatically flag\nany measurements with an error on the measurement over 7 mJy where that error is\ngreater than 15 per cent of the flux density of the measurement. Additionally, obviously\nerroneously low measurements (likely caused by the telescope not being positioned on\nthe source) have been manually flagged.\nIn total, 1034 measurements have been flagged, out of 3597 in total. This leaves\n2563 measurements, or an average of 4.7 per source.\nOn-off vs. cross-scan measurements\nIn order to check the systematics due to the repeated pointing of the Toru\u0144 radio\ntelescope during on-off measurements without recalibration of the telescope pointing corrections, three of the brightest CRATES sources \u2013 1435+638, 1656+477 and\n1732+389 \u2013 were observed first with a cross-scan measurement then with six on-off\nmeasurements in succession on 17 November 2008. The flux densities for these measurements are shown in Figure 5.16. Although there do not appear to be systematic\ndifferences between the cross-scan measurements and the on-off measurements, for\none source, 1732+389, the flux densities measured by on-offs fall by up to 20 per\n\n170\n\n\f5.3: CRATES SOURCE SAMPLE\n\n1200\n\nFlux density [mJy]\n\n1100\n\n1000\n\n900\n\n800\n\n700\n\n600\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n4\n5\nMeasurement number\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nFigure 5.16: Test cross-scan and on-off measurements of three strong CRATES\nsources. Measurement 1 is a cross-scan measurement; the remainder are on-off measurements. The error bars displayed are from the scatter of the 1s data points.\ncent compared with the cross-scan measurement. The telescope pointing uncertainty\nis thought to be up to around 15 arcsec; a change of 20 per cent implies an offset of\n20 arcsec. Although worrying, this particular measurement is likely to be an anomaly,\ncaused by changes in wind, or a problem with the pointing correction table for the\ntelescope at this particular position in the sky. Further investigation of this is needed,\nalthough similar instances within sets of on-off measurements can be identified by systematic offsets from the mean in the case of sources with high flux densities.\nA discrepancy between flux density measurements of sources using the on-off measurement technique compared to cross-scan measurements was noticed during the observations of planetary nebulae for Pazderska et al. (2009). To investigate this, a series of paired cross-scan and on-off measurements were made of a number of bright\n(200 mJy-6 Jy) CRATES sources between 18 November and 30 December 2008. These\nmeasurements are shown in Figure 5.17, after the removal of flagged measurements.\n\n171\n\n\f5: POINT SOURCE OBSERVATIONS WITH OCRA-P\n\nCross-scan flux density [mJy]\n\n10000\n\n1000\n\n100\n100\n\n1000\nOn-off flux density [mJy]\n\n10000\n\nFigure 5.17: Comparison of flux densities from pairs of cross-scan and on-off measurements on a number of CRATES sources. In each case, a cross-scan measurement\nwas made of a source, immediately followed by an on-off measurement. The on-off\nmeasurements are systematically lower than the cross-scan measurements by \u223c 5 per\ncent. The two lines shown are y = x (dashed line) and y = 1.05x (dotted line).\nThe on-off measurements are systematically lower than the cross-scan measurements; the scatter is always above the y = x line, and the average of the offset is 5-6\nper cent. The cross-scan measurements determine the pointing corrections for the telescopes, such that these measurements should always measure the flux density when\nthe beam is on the source. The on-off measurements are \"blind\" \u2013 that is, they rely\nthe previous pointing corrections to measure the source, rather than remeasuring them.\nIf those pointing corrections are not accurate, or drift over time, then this will result\nin the beam being positioned slightly to one side of the source, thus underestimating\nthe flux density of the source. The drop of 5 per cent in the flux densities implies an\noffset of 10 arcsec of the telescope (based on the 72 arcsec OCRA-p beam), which is\ncomparable to the known pointing uncertainty of the telescope.\nThis level of offset is within the calibration uncertainties for the measurements.\n\n172\n\n\f5.3: CRATES SOURCE SAMPLE\n\nAdditionally, it will be below the Gaussian noise level for the weak VSA sources. As\nCRATES sources that are stronger than 100 mJy will typically be observed with crossscan measurements rather than on-off measurements, this effect should also be fairly\nnegligible here. However, we increase the flux density for on-off measurements for the\nCRATES sample by 5 per cent to compensate for the systematic offset when compared\nto cross-scan measurements, and also add 5 per cent of the measured flux density to\nthe measurement error to account for the pointing uncertainty.\n\n5.3.4\n\nFlux densities\n\nThe flux densities of the CRATES source subsample as measured with OCRA-p are\ngiven in Table A.1. As with the VSA sources, the final error on the flux density for each\np\nsource is calculated by \u03c3 = \u03c32meas + (0.08S )2 where the 8 per cent of the flux density\ntakes into account the uncertainty due to calibration, atmospheric and gain-elevation\ncorrections and atmospheric effects. The 1.4, 4.8 and 8.4 GHz flux densities from the\nCRATES source catalogue are also listed. The spectra of the sources between 26 MHz\nand 150 GHz are given in Figure A.1 within Appendix A. These include data from a\nwide variety of sources, the references for which are given in Tables A.2 and A.3, also\nwithin the Appendix.\nFrom a visual comparison to NVSS (Condon et al. 1998) and FIRST (Becker et al.\n1995) data, the majority of the CRATES sources are unresolved. A number show\nextension, multiple components or have other sources very close by; these are marked\nwith an \"e\" in Table A.1. Sources where multiple CRATES components have been\nmerged together are denoted \"NC\" where \"N\" is the number of components.\n\n5.3.5\n\nComparison to other measurements\n\nThere are 77 sources in common between the CRATES subsample and the OCRA-p\nmeasurements of CJF sources made by Lowe et al. (2007); these are plotted in Figure 5.18. There is broad agreement between the two, although there is a large de-\n\n173\n\n\f5: POINT SOURCE OBSERVATIONS WITH OCRA-P\n\nOCRA CRATES flux density [mJy]\n\n10000\n\n1000\n\n100\n\n100\n\n1000\nOCRA CJF flux density [mJy]\n\n10000\n\nFigure 5.18: Comparison of common sources between CJF and CRATES.

Additionally, 1642+6856 has also increased\nsignificantly, from 2.75\u00b10.13 Jy to 4.1\u00b10.45 Jy with a large amount of scatter in the\nmeasured data points implying ongoing variability.\nThe subsample also has 27 sources in common with the 5 year WMAP point source\ncatalogue (Wright et al. 2009). These are listed in Table 5.9, which gives the OCRA\nmeasurement and the WMAP K (22 GHz) and Ka-band (33 GHz) flux densities. The\nsources are also marked as \"a\" where there are multiple identifications for the WMAP\nsources and \"v\" where there is evidence for variability in the WMAP observations, according to Wright et al. (2009). There is a good correspondence between the WMAP\nvariable sources and those with a high scatter within the OCRA measurements of a\nsource, based on the flux density errors calculated using the scatter of the OCRA mea-\n\n174\n\n\f5.3: CRATES SOURCE SAMPLE\n\nName\n1343+6602\n1344+6606\n1419+5423\n1436+6336\n1549+5038\n1604+5714\n1635+3808\n1637+4717\n1638+5720\n1642+3948\n1657+5705\n1700+6830\n1716+6836\n1727+4530\n1734+3857\n1739+4737\n1740+5211\n1748+7005\n1753+4409\n1801+4404\n1806+6949\n1824+5651\n1842+6809\n1849+6705\n1927+6117\n1927+7358\n2009+7229\n\nOCRA [Jy]\n0.33\u00b10.03\n0.38\u00b10.04\n0.73\u00b10.10\n1.11\u00b10.09\n0.62\u00b10.05\n0.57\u00b10.08\n2.78\u00b10.29\n1.09\u00b10.11\n1.63\u00b10.14\n6.72\u00b10.74\n0.52\u00b10.04\n0.40\u00b10.05\n0.65\u00b10.06\n1.56\u00b10.14\n1.13\u00b10.09\n0.69\u00b10.06\n1.07\u00b10.09\n0.48\u00b10.04\n0.46\u00b10.04\n1.15\u00b10.18\n1.60\u00b10.14\n1.84\u00b10.17\n0.89\u00b10.08\n3.72\u00b10.30\n0.59\u00b10.05\n3.81\u00b10.41\n0.67\u00b10.06\n\nWMAP K [Jy]\n0.7\u00b10.07\nas above\n0.8\u00b10.06\n0.5\u00b10.06\n0.9\u00b10.06\n0.7\u00b10.04\n3.9\u00b10.05\n0.9\u00b10.05\n1.3\u00b10.04\n6.5\u00b10.05\n0.5\u00b10.06\n0.2\u00b10.06\n0.6\u00b10.04\n0.9\u00b10.04\n1.2\u00b10.05\n0.8\u00b10.05\n1.2\u00b10.04\n0.6\u00b10.03\n0.7\u00b10.06\n1.2\u00b10.04\n1.4\u00b10.03\n1.5\u00b10.04\n1.1\u00b10.03\n1.2\u00b10.04\n1.0\u00b10.04\n3.5\u00b10.04\n0.7\u00b10.06\n\nWMAP Ka [Jy]\n0.4\u00b10.1\n0.8\u00b10.09\n\u2013\n0.8\u00b10.09\n0.7\u00b10.07\n4.3\u00b10.08\n1.0\u00b10.08\n1.3\u00b10.07\n6.0\u00b10.08\n0.6\u00b10.09\n0.5\u00b10.08\n0.6\u00b10.06\n1.0\u00b10.08\n1.3\u00b10.08\n0.8\u00b10.06\n1.2\u00b10.07\n0.7\u00b10.06\n0.6\u00b10.1\n1.4\u00b10.07\n1.4\u00b10.06\n1.3\u00b10.07\n1.2\u00b10.05\n1.4\u00b10.06\n1.0\u00b10.07\n3.2\u00b10.06\n0.6\u00b10.08\n\nNotes\nPaired with next, a\nav\na\na\nv\n\nv\n\nv\n\nv\nv\na\nav\nv\n\nTable 5.9: Comparison of WMAP and OCRA-p measurements of common CRATES\nsources.\nsurements.

The effects of\nthe selection criterion of \u03b14.8\n1.4 > \u22120.5 is obvious in the first of these. However, when\nthe 30 GHz flux density is considered the selection cut becomes much less defined.\n30\nThe mean and spread for \u03b14.8\n1.4 is \u22120.01\u00b10.37; this changes to \u22120.26\u00b10.29 for \u03b11.4 ,\n30\n\u22120.43\u00b10.43 for \u03b130\n4.8 and \u22120.42\u00b10.53 for \u03b18.4 . This reflects the steepening or turning\n\nover of the source spectra at high frequencies, as seen by e.g. Ricci et al. (2006);\nMassardi et al. (2008), although we note that there is a sample selection present within\nthe CRATES subsample as sources with \u03b14.8\n1.4 < \u22120.5 are excluded; any of those sources\n\n176\n\n\f5.3: CRATES SOURCE SAMPLE\n\nSpectral index between 8.4 and 30 GHz\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n-1\n\n-1.5\n-0.5\n\n0\n0.5\n1\nSpectral index between 1.4 and 4.8 GHz\n\n1.5\n\nFigure 5.20: A 2 colour diagram for the CRATES source sample, showing the spectral\nindex from 1.4 to 4.8 GHz compared with the spectral index from 8.4 to 30 GHz.

This will\nhave increased the number of sources with rising flux density between 8.4 and 30 GHz.\nIdeally, the sources would have been observed with the same resolution at all of the\nfrequencies using single dishes for this spectral index comparison to be completely\nrepresentative of the behaviour of the complete source sample.\n\n177\n\n\f5: POINT SOURCE OBSERVATIONS WITH OCRA-P\n\n5.3.7\n\nConclusions\n\nUsing OCRA-p, we have surveyed 550 flat spectrum radio sources around the North\nEcliptic Pole from the CRATES sample, which were selected based on their 1.44.8 GHz spectral index. These follow from the observation of the CJF sources by\nLowe (2006); Lowe et al. (2007), and extend the work to lower flux densities.\nWe find reasonable agreement between the measurements presented here and those\nby Lowe et al. (2007) and also WMAP (Wright et al. 2009) where sources are in common. A number of sources display variability between these three sets of observations,\nand also within the present measurements. This will present difficulties when subtracting these point sources from maps of the CMB.\nAs expected, we find that the spectral index distribution for these sources broadens\nat higher frequencies as the source spectral indices steepen. We find that there are a\nreasonable number (5.6 per cent) of Gigahertz-Peaked Sources, and also a number of\ninverted sources (\u223c 10 per cent). We conclude that extrapolation from low frequency\nflux densities to higher frequencies assuming power law spectra is unreliable. This emphasizes the need for high-frequency blind surveys to low flux densities. Such surveys\nare currently being carried out by the ATCA at 20 GHz in the southern hemisphere (see\ne.g. Sadler et al. 2007) and AMI at 15 GHz in the northern hemisphere (Waldram &\nPooley 2004; Waldram et al. 2009), and will be carried out by the OCRA-F instrument\nand its successors at 30 GHz in the near future.\nThe flux densities of the sources within the CRATES subsample described here\nwill be useful for comparison to point source measurements by the Planck satellite,\nwhich will be most sensitive in the area of sky surveyed here. Due to the flat spectrum\nnature of these sources, they are the most likely sources to appear in all of the different\nobservational bands of Planck. An Early Release Point Source Catalogue from Planck\nis expected in December 2010 (Bouchet 2009), at which point such a comparison can\nbe carried out.\n\n178\n\n\f6\nOCRA-FARADAY\nThe OCRA FARADAY (OCRA-F) instrument is an 8-beam 30 GHz receiver, and is\nthe second phase of the OCRA programme. It was designed and constructed as part of\nthe EC-funded \"Focal-plane Arrays for Radio Astronomy, Design Access and Yield\"\n(FARADAY) project within the RadioNet consortium. The design of the instrument\nis based on OCRA-p, and marks the transition of the programme both from a single\nreceiver module with a pair of horns to multiple receiver modules, and also from traditional components to integrated modules. The increase in the number of receivers\ngreatly improves the survey ability of OCRA, both due to the increase in the number of receivers (and hence effective integration time), or alternatively an increased\ninstantaneous field of view.\nThere are several interesting astrophysical questions that can be answered by using OCRA-F to carry out surveys of the microwave sky. The location of point sources\ndown to milliJansky flux density levels would enable improved characterization of their\nstatistical properties, making them easier to statistically remove from CMB observations. This information is also useful for SZ observations as it can be used to determine\nhow many clusters will not be detected as a result of their presence, hence providing\na correction factor to number counts of galaxy clusters for cosmology. The enhancement of point source numbers towards clusters is also of interest; recent difficulties\nhave been encountered in searches for the SZ effect in nearby (z < 0.5) clusters, which\n\n179\n\n\f6: OCRA-FARADAY\n\nFigure 6.1: OCRA-F in its test configuration, prior to disassembly. The three copper\nplates are (from top to bottom) the horn plate, the 20 K plate and the 50 K plate, with\nthe base of the cryostat at the bottom of the image. The FEMs are located at the base\nof the horns, and the BEMs are located beneath the 50 K plate; dummy bodies were\ninstalled in the cryostat at the time that this picture was taken.\n\nhave yet to be definitively explained. This could potentially be due to this overdensity\nof sources towards clusters.\nAnother aim of OCRA-F is to conduct blind surveys for SZ clusters. Thus far only\na few instruments have attempted this and only a small number of new clusters have\nbeen discovered this way to date (see Staniszewski et al. 2009; Hincks et al. 2009).\nPotentially OCRA-F can be used to measure the power spectrum of the CMB and SZ\neffect on small angular scales (see Section 3.9). OCRA-F can also carry out Galactic\nobservations, studying clouds of gas and dust within the plane of our Galaxy.\nOCRA-F will ultimately consist of 16 horns, arranged in 8 pairs. The first phase\n\n180\n\n\fof the project is an 8-beam, 4-pair system, which was primarily funded by the EU.\nWhilst OCRA-p used traditional, Microwave Integrated Circuit (MIC)-based components, OCRA-F uses Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuits (MMICs). As well\nas allowing more components into a smaller area, these should also allow for larger\nreceiver arrays to be constructed more easily due to the reduced manpower needed to\nassemble the devices. It is also thought that MMIC technology is more repeatable than\nMIC technology, such that multiple devices should have similar values of gain and\nnoise, although the degree to which this is true remains to be quantified.\nAt the start of the Author's involvement in the OCRA-F project, the receiver cryostat had been constructed in a test configuration, as shown by Figure 6.1, with 5 Front\nEnd Modules (FEMs) constructed and around 10 Back End Modules (BEMs). Tests\nhad been carried out on the individual modules, with some testing done using a combination of a FEM and a BEM, however no complete receiver chain tests had been\ncarried out. The Author assisted in the dismantling and reassembly of the cryostat into\nits final configuration, led the testing of the complete receiver chains and assisted in\nthe installation and initial commissioning of the receiver on the Toru\u0144 32-m telescope.\nThe design of the receiver is summarized in Section 6.1. Section 6.2 then describes\nthe individual components of OCRA-F, and the testing of them that has been carried\nout by the Author. This includes the three active components \u2013 the FEMs, BEMs and\ndetectors \u2013 as well as the passive waveguide and filter components, and brief sections\non the cryogenics and electronics of the receiver. The tests of partial and complete radiometer chain are then described in Section 6.3. Problems were encountered with the\nfoam vacuum support window; these are described in Section 6.3.3. The receiver was\ninstalled on the telescope in December 2009, and the initial steps of commissioning the\nreceiver are described in Section 6.4. Section 6.5 gives a discussion of future possible\nimprovements that could be made to OCRA-F, followed by a summary of the chapter\nin Section 6.6.\n\n181\n\n\f6: OCRA-FARADAY\n\n6.1\n\nDesign overview\n\nThe design of a receiver chain in OCRA-F is essentially the same as that in OCRA-p\n(see Lowe 2006 for details). This design in turn is based on the receiver chains in the\nPlanck Low Frequency Instrument (LFI; Mandolesi et al. 2000), and is similar to the\nWMAP 23 GHz receivers (Jarosik et al. 2003). A block diagram of a chain is shown in\nFigure 6.2.\nUnlike Planck, which differences between a cold load and the sky, OCRA has two\nhorns such that the effects of fluctuations in atmospheric emission and attenuation (for\nconvenience, this is hereafter referred to as atmospheric 1/ f noise) that are common\nto the two beams can be cancelled out. The signals from the two horns are combined\nusing a 90\u25e6 hybrid, with the combination of the signals passed through a pair of LNAs\nand phase switches; the signals are then separated again using a second hybrid. Following this, further amplification is applied to the signals, which are then filtered to\ndefine the bandwidth of the system prior to the signal being detected. Video amplifiers\nthen boost the detected signal such that it can be recorded using a Data AcQuisition\nsystem (DAQ).\nIt is important that the phase paths between the two hybrids are well matched;\noffsets in this phase will result in cross-mixing of the signals such that the system\nhas very bad isolation, which in turn will greatly reduce the efficiency of the receiver.\nWith OCRA-p, only the initial hybrid and LNAs were within the cryostat, with the\nphase switches and the second hybrid outside of the cryostat, such that the phase of the\nsignal that exits the cryostat is important. With OCRA-F, however, the phase sensitive\nsection of the receiver is within a single module, the FEM, all of which is within\nthe cryostat and cooled to 20 K. This has both benefits and drawbacks. The increased\nmodularization eases the assembly process of the receiver chain, however the balancing\nof the phase must be done during the construction of the FEM, and once set it is difficult\nto change as phase shifters cannot be inserted, so the only way of altering the phase is\nto alter the biases of the amplifiers.\n\n182\n\n\f6.1: DESIGN OVERVIEW\n\nCryostat window\nCryostat\nHorns\n50K\nFEM\nHybrid\n\nLNAs\nPhase switches\n\nHybrid\n20K\nBEM\n300K\n\nLNAs\n\nBEM\n\nFilters\n\nDetectors\nVideo amps\n\nDAQ\n\nFigure 6.2: A block diagram of an OCRA-F receiver chain (not to scale).

This means that they have much higher noise than the FEMs, however\nthis negligibly affects the overall system temperature of the receiver as it comes after\nthe first stages of amplification.\nThe nominal specifications for the system are given in Table 6.1. Note that the system temperature given is for all contributions, including the atmosphere: the receiver\ntemperature should be around 30 K. This receiver temperature is higher than that of\nOCRA-p (15 K Lowe 2006), however the bandwidth is larger to compensate, resulting\nin similar noise performance of a receiver pair in OCRA-F to that of OCRA-p. The\nreceiver temperature is comparable to that of the 31 GHz receiver on the Green Bank\nTelescope (20-40 K across the band; see Mason et al. 2009). The best performance that\nhas been achieved with 30 GHz receivers are those in Planck LFI, which have a system\ntemperature of 10.7 K (Mandolesi et al. 2010; Davis et al. 2009); however these have\nbeen designed for operation in space, where atmospheric effects are not present.\n\n6.2\n\nConstruction and testing\n\nThe OCRA-F cryostat, which was initially assembled in a test configuration, was completely dismantled at the end of January 2008 (Figure 6.3), at which point reconstruction from the bottom up was started. Such a complete reconstruction was required as\nthe copper plates comprising the two cold stage plates and the horn plate needed to be\nplated with nickel. This increases the reflection (and hence decreases the absorption)\n\n184\n\n\f6.2: CONSTRUCTION AND TESTING\n\nFigure 6.3: The components of OCRA-F on 15 January 2008, following the dismantling of it from its test configuration and prior to its reconstruction into its final configuration.\n\nof photons such that the radiation transfer of heat is decreased, hence improving the\ncryogenic performance of the cryostat. The build quality of the receiver was also unknown \u2013 for example, the secureness of the screws and the state of the vacuum seals\n\u2013 due to the long period of testing that the cryostat underwent. The reconstruction\nalso allowed a series of small modifications to be made to the cryostat to improve its\ncryogenic properties.\n\n6.2.1\n\nActive components\n\nFront End Modules\nFor astronomical observations, the most important parts of the receiver are the low\nnoise amplifiers. Of these, the most critical are the first amplifiers, located in the Front\nEnd Modules (FEMs). The performance of the first stage of these amplifiers defines\n\n185\n\n\f6: OCRA-FARADAY\n\nFigure 6.4: An OCRA-F Front End Module (FEM 1). The lid is on the left hand side,\nand the main body on the right. The input is from the top and output at the bottom.\nThe MMICs are the small black components; from top to bottom these are a hybrid,\namplifiers, phase switches and a second hybrid.\n\nthe majority of the noise of the receiver, with the gain of this stage down-weighting the\nnoise in the signal added by the later stages.\nAs described in Section 6.1, the FEMs consist of a pair of amplifiers and phase\nswitches, encapsulated by two hybrids. FEM 1 is shown in Figure 6.4. The amplifiers,\nphase switches and hybrids are all MMIC modules, designed and manufactured within\nthe FARADAY framework; see Kettle et al. (2005a,b); Kettle & Roddis (2007a,b) for\ndetails.\nThe FEMs were individually tested by D. Lawson prior to the Author's involvement\nin the project. A summary of the properties of the FEMs as measured by him are given\nin Table 6.2. Whilst 5 FEMs were constructed, FEM 3 could not be properly balanced \u2013\nthat is, the gains and phases in the two arms were different, making it difficult to cancel\nout the 1/ f noise of the amplifiers. This FEM has hence not been used in OCRA-F.\n\n186\n\n\f6.2: CONSTRUCTION AND TESTING\n\nProperty\nOutput\nGain (dB)\nNoise (K)\nIsolation (per cent) swA\nIsolation (per cent) swB\n\nFEM 1\n1\n2\n31 31\n24 26\n2.6 1.8\n3.0 4.3\n\nFEM 2\n1\n2\n33 33\n35 33\n5.8 4.5\n7.0 6.0\n\nFEM 4\n1\n2\n32 32\n26 27\n3.1 3.1\n4.9 5.4\n\nFEM 5\n1\n2\n34 35\n27 23\n3.0 4.1\n5.4 4.7\n\nTable 6.2: The properties of the OCRA-F FEMs as of June 2007, measured by D.\nLawson.

The amplifier MMIC can be seen in the centre of the body.\n\nDuring testing of the radiometer chains (see Section 6.3), one of the LNAs in\nFEM 1 stopped drawing current. After some investigation, it was discovered that the\nMMIC had broken due to the glue used to attach it to the body of the FEM. This was\nthe first FEM to be constructed, and the adhesive used was most likely a rigid one that\nhad previously caused problems like this. Later FEMs used a more flexible adhesive,\nso they should not be prone to this problem. For FEM 1, the LNA was replaced, with\nthe gains becoming 31.8 dB in both LNAs, with noise temperatures of 24K.\nBack End Modules\nThe Back End Modules (BEMs) are much simpler devices than the FEMs, consisting\nof a single MMIC amplifier (see Figure 6.5) that is operated at room temperature.

The measurements were taken using standard bias settings to power the amplifiers.\n\nmakes them much quicker to construct and test.\nThe gain of the BEMs as a function of frequency is plotted in Figure 6.6, using\nstandard bias settings (drain voltages of 1.3 V, gate voltages chosen such that the current is 8 mA per stage). This peaks at \u223c27 GHz, and at high frequencies it drops off\nby around 10dB, which reduces the effective bandwidth of the amplifiers. This is surprising, as the MMICs were designed to have a large range of frequencies (\u223c10 GHz)\nover which the gain was approximately constant. This is not an issue for OCRA-F,\nhowever, as the combined FEM-BEM gain is considerably flatter (see later).\nThe input return loss (also plotted in Figure 6.6) should ideally be around -30dB,\nhowever for the amplifiers used in the BEMs this is much closer to zero, and is positive\nat around 27 GHz in some of the BEMs. This is a concern, as it means that the BEMs\nwill reflect a large amount of the power put into them by the FEMs, and can lead to the\namplifiers interacting. The effect of this in practice will be discussed in Section 6.3.1.\nFigure 6.7 shows the gain and input return loss of BEM 6 as a function of gate\nvoltage and hence current (keeping the drain voltage constant at 1.3 V). The peak in\nthe gain curve shifts down in frequency as the gate voltage is increased towards zero.\nThe input return loss is positive when the gain is highest, and becomes more negative\nas the gain is decreased. As such, a bias setting that does not maximize the gain is\n\n188\n\n\f6.2: CONSTRUCTION AND TESTING\n\n2\n\n30\n\n1\nInput return loss (dB)\n\n35\n\nGain (dB)\n\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n\n0\n-1\n-2\n-3\n-4\n-5\n\n0\n\n-6\n22\n\n24\n\n26\n\n28\n\n30\n\n32\n\n34\n\n36\n\n22\n\n24\n\nFrequency (GHz)\n\n26\n\n28\n\n30\n\n32\n\n34\n\n36\n\nFrequency (GHz)\n\nFigure 6.7: The gains (left) and input return losses (right) of BEM 6, using a constant\ndrain voltage of 1.3 V and stepping the gate voltage by 0.05 V from -0.3-0 V.

We will return to this issue in Section 6.3.2.\nDetection\nFollowing these two sets of amplification, the signals are detected using commercial\ndetectors, manufactured by Farran Technologies, with model number WDP-28. These\ndetectors have also been used in OCRA-p. Final amplification prior to data acquisition\nis done by video amplifiers. These were constructed by E. Pazderski in late 2008, with\ntemporary video amplifiers used for initial tests.\nThe detectors were tested by the Author using an RF signal generator and measuring the RF power using both an Anritsu ML2437A power meter equipped with a\nMA2474A power sensor, and also a detector and video amplifier combination, for a\nvariety of input powers between approximately \u22123 and \u221240 dBm. The results of these\ntest are shown in Figure 6.8, which shows that the detectors are roughly linear between\n5 and 300 mV (\u221235 dBm to \u221214 dBm), and become non-linear at higher and lower\npowers. The power meter should be linear to within 2.5 per cent, and sensitive between -70 and +20 dBm, according to its specification. Testing using the two different\nvideo amplifiers showed that whilst the temporary video amplifier had a lower gain,\nthe properties of the video amplifiers are otherwise very similar. Hence it appears to\n\n189\n\n\f6: OCRA-FARADAY\n\nVoltage from detector and video amplifier [mV]\n\n10000\n\n1000\n\n100\n\n10\n\n1\n0.0001\n\n0.001\n0.01\nRadio frequency power [mW]\n\n0.1\n\nFigure 6.8: Comparison of the detector and video amplifier output vs. RF power (measured using a power meter) for various input powers (red solid line) compared with\na linear function (blue dotted line).

We will return to this issue in Section 6.3.2.\n\n6.2.2\n\nWaveguides\n\nVarious sets of waveguides are used to guide the signal through the receiver. These\nstart off with the horn, which has a thermal insulator attached prior to a circular-torectangular convertor. A Z-shape waveguide brings the signal into the FEMs, then\na C-shape waveguide transfers the signal from the FEM to the BEMs. An L-shape\nwaveguide then takes the output of the BEMs to the base of the cryostat where the\nfilters are connected. These are shown in place within the cryostat in Figure 6.9.\nWhilst the horns were not tested by the Author, the remaining components were.\nThe tests were carried out by connecting the waveguides to an Anritsu 37397A Vector\nNetwork Analyser, which passed a known signal through them and measured the trans-\n\n190\n\n\f6.2: CONSTRUCTION AND TESTING\n\nFigure 6.9: The waveguides located within the OCRA-F cryostat.

This same device was used by\nD. Lawson and E. Blackhurst to measure the gain of the FEMs and the BEMs, and\nwas also used by the Author to test the individual receiver chains (see Section 6.3.1).\nPrior to use, it was calibrated using a standard calibration kit to ensure that when the\nwaveguide ports were connected together, the transmission between the ports was flat\nand at 0dB (within an uncertainty of \u223c0.1dB), and that the return losses were around\n-30dB.\nHorn to waveguide thermal insulators and circular-to-rectangular convertors\nThe thermal insulators are essentially stainless steel discs with a circular hole in the\ncentre that acts as the waveguide. Several materials were considered for the insulators prior to the involvement of the Author, most notably gold-plated Nylon, however\nthese were not deemed to be efficient waveguides. To optimise the insulation of the\nspacers, the surface area that connects them to the horns and the later waveguides was\nminimized by the removal of contact material not required to transmit the RF signal or\nmaintain the spacer positions.\nThe RF performance of the insulators were tested using two rectangular-to-circular\nconvertors to connect to the rectangular waveguide connectors of the VNA.

This is thought to be due to reflections from internal surfaces due to imperfect\nalignment of the components. To reduce this, the insulators were cleaned, and their\nsiting was optimised. This reduced the spikes significantly, but did not completely\neliminate them. However, as OCRA-F is a broadband receiver rather than a spectral\nreceiver, these remaining spikes were deemed to be unimportant.\nAt the same time as the thermal insulators were tested, the circular-to-rectangular\nconvertors were also tested in pairs. Spikes also appeared in the gain as a function of\nfrequency measured during these tests. These spikes are due to the same positioning\nissue as was present in the insulators.\nInterconnection waveguides\nThe other waveguides within the cryostat were also tested to check their transmission\nperformance. The C-shape waveguides between the FEM and the BEM have a loss of\n\u223c 0.3dB (compared to <0.1dB for the other waveguides); this is unimportant, however,\nas they come after the initial amplification. It may even be beneficial \u2013 it means that\nthere is some loss (albeit not much) in the signal reflected by the BEMs. It is interesting\nto note that C-shape 7 was tested as more lossy, and subsequently broke.\nThe waveguides were made commercially using Nickel-Colbalt (NiCo), and were\n\n192\n\n\f6.2: CONSTRUCTION AND TESTING\n\n10\n0\n\n0\n\n-10\n-2\n\n-30\n\nGain (dB)\n\nGain (dB)\n\n-20\n-40\n-50\n-60\n\n-4\n-6\n\n-70\n-80\n\n-8\n\n-90\n-100\n\n-10\n22\n\n24\n\n26\n\n28\n30\n32\n34\nFrequency (GHz)\n\n36\n\n38\n\n40\n\n24\n\n26\n\n28\n\n30\n32\nFrequency (GHz)\n\n34\n\n36\n\n38\n\nFigure 6.11: Transmission properties of the OCRA-F filters as measured on 14 April\n2008.

The first set of waveguides appear to have insufficient NiCo\ndeposited on them during the electrolysis process, resulting in them being rather fragile. Two of the L-shape and one of the C-shape waveguides were broken either during\ntransport or during installation; a Z-shape waveguide subsequently cracked during receiver testing. The second batch of waveguides have had more NiCo deposited on\nthem, such that they look and feel more substantial \u2013 to date, none of these have failed.\nFilters\nIn order to remove out-of-band noise, filters are used to define the frequency range of\ninterest. The filters used within OCRA-F are manufactured by A1 Microwave, and are\nmodel number PB1332WB. They have a specified frequency range of 23 to 36 GHz.\nFigure 6.11 shows the measured frequency range of the filters; the filters have very\nsharp cut-offs below 25 and above 36.5 GHz. Although different from the specified\nvalues, this range is suitable for use in OCRA-F as it increases the frequency separation from the 22 GHz atmospheric water vapour line, the most important source of\natmospheric 1/ f noise.\n\n193\n\n\f6: OCRA-FARADAY\n\n6.2.3\n\nCryogenics\n\nWhen cold, the outer radiation shield and horn plate of the OCRA-F cryostat are cooled\nto \u223c50 K, and the innermost plate upon which the FEMs are mounted is cooled to\n\u223c20 K. As OCRA-F has a large cryostat (nearly 60cm across), these temperatures\nare not trivial to obtain. The cryogenic pump used within OCRA-F, CTI-Cryogenics\nmodel 1020 CP, is one of the most powerful available.\nDuring the reassembly of the cryostat, various tweaks were made to the cryostat\nto improve its cryogenic performance. The Author was involved in the creation of a\nnumber of thermal super-insulation \"blankets\", which consist of multiple alternating\nlayers of aluminium-coated mylar foil and loose nylon weave. These were positioned\nabove and below the 20K plate, as well as around the outside of the radiation shield and\non the 50K stages where they face loads of 300K. This thermal insulation prevents the\ncolder components from \"seeing\" the hotter ones \u2013 mainly the outer cryostat, which is\nat room temperature \u2013 thus making it easier to cool the receiver, and to keep it cold.\nTo monitor the performance of the cryostat, four temperature diodes were positioned within it. The first of these is on the 50 K plate, the second on the cold head,\nthe third is on the 20 K plate and the fourth on the horn plate (see Figure 6.1). Once\ncold, the cryostat obtains \u223c 17 K on the cold stage, giving a physical FEM temperature of \u223c 20 K. The horns and the 50 K plate are cooled to \u223c 45 K. During initial\ntesting, the cryostat was able to maintain these temperatures over periods of months;\nonce mounted upon the telescope the temperatures of the receiver will be monitored\nroutinely to quantify the temperature stability.\n\n6.2.4\n\nElectrical connections\n\nDuring the reassembly of the cryostat, all of the wiring within it was replaced with\nmanganine wire, which conducts less heat than copper wire and hence is preferable\nwithin a cryostat. However, manganine wire is higher resistance than standard, copper\nwire, and gives a resistance of 72 ohms between the connection at the power supply and\n\n194\n\n\f6.3: RADIOMETER CHAIN PERFORMANCE\n\nthe FEM connectors, hence causing a voltage drop between the two. This necessitates\nan increase in the drain voltages used to bias the amplifiers compared to the voltages\nused in laboratory tests (and hence those for which the balance of the module was\ndetermined) to compensate for this voltage drop and to bring the currents to the same\nlevel as used in the laboratory.\nDuring the construction and initial testing of OCRA-F, the join between the manganine and connector wires for the FEMs was identified as a weak point: several wires\nbroke at this point. In future, this join should probably be done by a breadboard, or the\nmanganine wire should be connected straight to the connectors.\n\n6.3\n6.3.1\n\nRadiometer chain performance\nFEM-BEM combination\n\nThe combination of the FEMs and BEMs were tested within the cryostat at room temperature prior to the installation of the horns on the receiver. The principle tests were\ncarried out using the Vector Network Analyser to investigate the gain of the complete\nreceiver. The tests were carried out using nominal biases for the FEMs at room temperature as previously used for tests of the modules, with drains of 1.5V and gates set\nsuch that the currents drawn by each pair of stages was 10mA, and also nominal biases\nfor the BEMs (as per Section 6.2.1 above). In addition to measuring the gain properties\nof the receiver chains, this also provided a test of the system assembly; several issues\nwith the bias wiring were highlighted and fixed during these tests.\nFigure 6.12 shows the gains of the four chains, where the signals have been put into\nthe first input to each of the FEMs and measured for all four phase switch settings at\nthe appropriate BEM outputs. The gain as a function of frequency is broadly the same\nbetween all four chains, although with the chosen BEM bias settings the third receiver\nchain has a lower gain at high frequencies for one of the outputs.\nAll four chains have ripples in the gain curves; this is caused by the interaction\n\n195\n\n\f60\n\n60\n\n50\n\n50\n\n40\n\n40\nGain (dB)\n\nGain (dB)\n\n6: OCRA-FARADAY\n\n30\n\n30\n\n20\n\n20\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0\n24\n\n26\n\n28\n\n30\n\n32\n\n34\n\n36\n\n38\n\n40\n\n24\n\n26\n\n28\n\n30\n\n32\n\n34\n\n36\n\n38\n\n40\n\n34\n\n36\n\n38\n\n40\n\nFrequency\n\n60\n\n60\n\n50\n\n50\n\n40\n\n40\nGain (dB)\n\nGain (dB)\n\nFrequency\n\n30\n\n30\n\n20\n\n20\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0\n24\n\n26\n\n28\n\n30\n\n32\n\nFrequency\n\n34\n\n36\n\n38\n\n40\n\n24\n\n26\n\n28\n\n30\n\n32\n\nFrequency\n\nFigure 6.12: Combined gain from the OCRA-F FEM-BEM combinations for Chains\n1 (top left), 2 (top right), 3 (bottom left) and 4 (bottom right). The four lines are the\n4 different phase switch settings; all signals were put into the same FEM input, and\nmeasured at the appropriate BEM output.\n\nbetween the FEM and the BEMs due to the bad input return loss of the BEMs (see\nSection 6.2.1). The effect is similar to that seen in the back end of OCRA-p during\ntesting (see Lowe 2006), and which was resolved via the insertion of an isolator before\nthe back end amplifier in OCRA-p. In the case of OCRA-F, however, this is impractical\nas both the FEM and the BEM are located within the cryostat, such that there is no\nspace to insert an isolator without modification to the waveguides. 1 However, the gain\nripples are not critical as OCRA-F is a broadband continuum receiver.\n1\n\nIt would be possible to install a small piece of resistive foam within the FEM-BEM waveguides to\n\nattenuate the RF signal, which would effectively do the same as an isolator. Tests using FEM 3 and a\nBEM at room temperature with a variable attenuator between the FEM and the BEM showed that as the\nattentuation is increased the gain ripples decrease, with around 6 dB attenuation required to remove the\nripples fully.\n\n196\n\n\f6.3: RADIOMETER CHAIN PERFORMANCE\n\nProperty\nInput\nGain (dB)\nBandwidth (GHz)\nIsolation (per cent)\n\nChain 1\n1\n2\n48.0 47.2\n7.9\n7.9\n8.7\n9.8\n\nChain 2\n1\n2\n48.6 48.7\n7.4\n7.4\n7.8\n8.1\n\nChain 3\n1\n2\n47.2 47.4\n7.3\n7.2\n8.0\n8.2\n\nChain 4\n1\n2\n48.4 48.0\n8.0\n8.0\n10.0 9.2\n\nTable 6.3: Room temperature properties of the OCRA-F receiver chains from measurements with the VNA.

This also shows that the gain ripples do not significantly affect\nthe bandwidth. The isolation is calculated by measuring the output from both BEMs\nusing the same input to the FEM and the same phase switch settings, then working\nout the percentage of the signal that is coming out of the \"wrong\" BEM compared to\nthat from the \"right\" BEM, again between 25 and 36 GHz. Whilst this is larger than\nwas measured by the FEMs alone, it should be remembered that this is using nominal\nbias settings for the amplifiers, rather than optimised ones. Improved bias settings to\nbalance the gain and phase from the LNAs should improve the isolation.\nFollowing from these tests, the horns were installed into the cryostat and the cryogenic performance of OCRA-F was tested. Tests of the complete receiver chains at\ncryogenic temperatures were subsequently carried out.\n\n197\n\n\f6: OCRA-FARADAY\n\n6.3.2\n\nSystem temperature measurements\n\nIt is important to measure the system temperature of the receiver as this determines\nthe Gaussian noise level of the instrument. For OCRA-F, these measurements also\nrevealed two important issues within the receiver \u2013 that the detectors were non-linear\n(discovered by inconsistent results from different measurement techniques) and that the\nfoam window in front of the receiver was \"noisy\" (producing a higher that expected\nsystem temperature). The measurements and discoveries are detailed below.\nIn order to carry out measurements of the system temperature, OCRA-F was relocated in December 2008 to the \"Don Dome\", a test facility away from buildings that\nconsists of a metal reflective plate angled at 45\u25e6 at which the receiver is pointed, such\nthe receiver sees the sky; further angled metal plates minimize the ground radiation\nthat is seen by the receiver, and the complex is protected from the weather using radio\ntransparent plastic sheeting (in practice, a poly-tunnel). This setup additionally allows\nthe easy insertion of either room temperature or cooled sheets of absorber between the\nsky and the receiver.\nSystem temperature tests were performed by measuring the output power from the\nreceiver when looking at a 300 K (room temperature) sheet of microwave absorber, and\nalso a sheet of absorber cooled to 77 K using liquid nitrogen. The system temperature\nT sys can then be calculated using\nT sys =\n\nT hot \u2212 YT cold\nY \u22121\n\n(6.2)\n\nwhere Y = Vhot /Vcold in the case of a measured voltage V or Y = 10Phot /10 /10Pcold /10 in\nthe case of a measured power in dBm.\nThe output power was measured in two ways: using the detectors and video amplifiers, or using a power meter. Initial tests with the detectors resulted in system\ntemperature measurements of 20\u201330 K, with one output giving 50 K, which seemed\nreasonable. However, tests with the power meter yielded values closer to 60-70 K.\nAfter a lengthy investigation, it emerged that the detectors were being driven in their\nnon-linear regime (see Section 6.2.1). Once the BEM amplification was decreased (by\n\n198\n\n\f6.3: RADIOMETER CHAIN PERFORMANCE\n\nreducing the gate and drain voltages, and hence the current drawn) the two methods\ncame into agreement and the same system temperatures of 60-70 K were measured using the detectors as was measured by the power meters. In practice, this non-linearity\nis only a problem for system temperature measurements due to the large range of input\nloads being seen (room temperature vs. a cold load). Astronomical sources do not display such a large range, so effects of this non-linearity on these measurements should\nbe negligible.\nThe system temperature of OCRA-F should have been dominated by the noise from\nthe initial amplifiers in the FEMs, which had been measured to be 25\u201330 K (see Section\n6.2.1, Kettle & Roddis 2007b). It was thought that the increase in system temperature\nto 60-70 K may have been due to water vapour within the cryostat, however purging\nthe cryostat with dry air had negligible effect. It soon emerged that the problem lay\nin the foam window, which was adding \u223c20\u201330 K extra noise; this is discussed in the\nfollowing section.\n\n6.3.3\n\nFoam window\n\nIn order for a receiver in a vacuum chamber to see outside of the chamber, it has to\nlook through a window. For most receivers this would consist of a thin mylar window,\nhowever as OCRA-F has such a large vacuum window (480mm; the largest constructed\nat JBO to date), a foam support is required for the mylar sheet.\nThis foam window, depicted in Figure 6.13, was originally constructed using high\ndensity styrofoam manufactured by Dow Corning, and is retailed as Floormate 500-A.\nInitial tests found that this was able to support the pressure of the vacuum (around 1.7\ntonnes) when suitably thick. Measurements with a VNA carried out by Neil Roddis\non a piece of foam that had been baked and inserted into a waveguide suggested that\nits insertion loss was sufficiently small that it was no longer measurable. Based on\nthis later evidence, the foam was used for the OCRA-F window. However, the tests\nwith the complete OCRA-F receiver revealed that the system temperature was higher\n\n199\n\n\f6: OCRA-FARADAY\n\nFigure 6.13: The original foam window for OCRA-F, enclosed within its mounting\nring. Note the hand on the top-right for scale.\n\nthan expected by a factor of 2 (see Section 6.3.2). Subsequently, the noise properties\nof the foam were tested using a spare receiver system from the VSA, which provides\na more conveniently sized test system with a lower system temperature than that of\nOCRA-F and its window. Tests of a smaller piece of a lower density version of the\nfoam (Floormate 200-X, around 2/3 the thickness of the foam window) showed that\nthe foam added \u223c25K to the system temperature. This was not reduced by vacuumbaking the foam for several weeks, something that is as expected for a closed cell foam.\nAs a result, it became apparent that different and lower loss foam was required for the\nwindow support.\nA number of other high frequency experiments use foam either to support a vacuum\nwindow, or to support elements of the telescope. The most widely used type of foam\nis Zotefoam PPA-30, which is used by AMiBA, ACBAR, QUaD and SPT (Chen et al.\n2003; Runyan et al. 2003; QUaD collaboration: J. Hinderks et al. 2008; Ruhl et al.\n2004, respectively), however it was not possible to obtain a suitable quantity of this\nfoam. CBI and C-Bass use Plasterzote LDF45, which has less than 1 per cent loss at\n30 GHz (Prof. M. Jones, private communication), unfortunately this low density foam\n\n200\n\n\f6.4: COMMISSIONING\n\ndoes not have the mechanical strength to be used as a window.\nSamples of alternative foams from the same manufacturer were obtained and tested\nusing the VSA receiver system. Tests of 1 cm thick samples of Zotek F30, F40HT\nand F75HT, which were selected as they were made using inert nitrogen, showed an\nincrease of \u223c3K in the system temperature, thus these foams are not suitable for use for\nthe window. Tests of Plastazote HD30, HD80 and LD45 were more promising; a 1 cm\nthick sample of these negligibly changed the receiver temperature. Finally, Plastazote\nPK80 was also tested; this gave an increased system temperature of 1.5 \u00b1 0.5K for a\n4 cm-thick piece (0.03dB loss).\nDue to the availability of thick pieces of PK80 (formed by heat bonding multiple\nlayers of foam together), this foam was used to make an OCRA-F window. Initial\nmechanical tests with this window however showed that the foam distorted easily, and\nthe window collapsed inwards after a few hours of testing. As the full aperture of\nOCRA-F is not required at this point, because only 8 of the 16 horns are installed, a\nmetal support plate was constructed to reduce the load on the foam. This support plate\nproved effective in reducing the distortion of the foam, and the new window with the\nlower loss foam support should be installed on OCRA-F in early 2010.\nIt is worth noting that other window materials exist aside from foam. ACT, for\nexample, uses 4 mm thick Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (Swetz et al.\n2008) and the high frequency (90 GHz and above) instruments of ALMA use crystal\nquartz windows with plastic antireflective coatings (Koller et al. 2001). These were\nnot investigated for use with OCRA-F for cost reasons, but may be of use for future\nOCRA instruments.\n\n6.4\n\nCommissioning\n\nOCRA-F was shipped to TCfA in July 2009. For the commissioning period a window\nmade of the original (lossy) foam was used whilst a new window with mechanical\nsupport was being fabricated from the less lossy foam. Once at TCfA, it was integrated\n\n201\n\n\f6: OCRA-FARADAY\n\nwith the OCRA-F DAQ and a field rotator, and initial tests of the complete system were\nmade. OCRA-F was then installed onto the 32 m telescope on 7 December 2009, and\nthe process of commissioning the receiver was started.\nThe initial tests of the radiometer chains described thus far used a test DAQ, which\ncould only record two inputs at once. A new DAQ capable of recording all 16 inputs\nfrom a complete OCRA-F was purchased and prepared in TCfA; this was connected\nto OCRA-F in August 2009. The DAQ consists of a dual-core computer system with\na National Instruments DAQ card installed. This card interfaces with the output from\nthe video amplifiers using a pair of National Instruments SCB-68 shielded breakout\nboxes. In addition to recording the output of the 8 OCRA-F channels, the DAQ also\nrecords the phase switch state and the time that the samples are taken at, as well as the\ntelescope position.\nInitial tests with the combined system showed that a large 50 Hz signal was present;\nswitching the fluorescent lighting in the room off significantly reduced this. This\nshould not be an issue for the receiver on the telescope, however care needs to be\ntaken to ground the receiver appropriately to minimize 50 Hz signals from the mains\nelectricity supply.\nFigure 6.14 shows a sample of the switched output signal from all 8 outputs, taken\nwhilst looking at a liquid nitrogen (77K) load. The first 7-9 of the \u223c 200 samples in\neach switch state are systematically low in a characteristic 'spike', caused by the finite\ntime it takes for the phase switch to change from one state to the other, during which\ntime it passes through an off state. These spikes will need to be removed (\"blanked\")\nfrom the sampled output, reducing the integration time of the instrument by about 5\nper cent (and hence increasing the noise level per second by the square root of that\namount). Note that these measurements were taken in the laboratory prior to fine\ntuning of the amplifiers for performance, however the switching spikes depend solely\non the phase switches and are independent of the amplifier settings.\nTwo minute long timestreams from all 8 of the outputs of OCRA-F were taken in\nthe laboratory at TCfA, with the receiver looking at a liquid nitrogen-soaked sheet of\n\n202\n\n\f6.4: COMMISSIONING\n\n-0.072\n\n-0.04\n\n-0.074\n-0.05\n\n-0.076\n\nOutput voltage (mV)\n\nOutput voltage (mV)\n\n-0.078\n-0.08\n-0.082\n-0.084\n-0.086\n\n-0.06\n\n-0.07\n\n-0.08\n\n-0.088\n-0.09\n\n-0.09\n\n-0.092\n-0.094\n\n-0.1\n200\n\n400\n600\nSample number\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n-0.11\n\n-0.07\n\n-0.12\n\n-0.08\n\n-0.13\n\n-0.09\nOutput voltage (mV)\n\nOutput voltage (mV)\n\n0\n\n-0.14\n-0.15\n\n200\n\n400\n600\nSample number\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n600\nSample number\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n-0.1\n-0.11\n\n-0.16\n\n-0.12\n\n-0.17\n\n-0.13\n\n-0.18\n\n0\n\n-0.14\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n600\nSample number\n\n800\n\n1000\n\nFigure 6.14: Samples of the switched output from the four receiver chains of OCRAF. The output voltages depend on the gain during the measurements; these were taken\nbefore any fine-tuning of the amplifiers for performance. The phase switch is switching\nat 277 Hz; there are \u223c200 samples per switch state.\n\nabsorber. The Fourier transforms of these are shown in Figure 6.15. A peak at 50 Hz\nis still present at a fairly high level due to the lighting in the building, and possibly\nalso the mains power supply. The knee frequency in the double-differenced output is\ncurrently between 0.1 and 1 Hz when looking at a 77 K load. Measurements of the\ndouble-differenced knee frequency by Kettle & Roddis (2007b) looking at a \u223c 30 K\nwaveguide load showed this to be \u223c 8mHz. This discrepancy is probably due to the\nreceivers not being fully tuned, the different load temperatures being measured and\npotentially also to the changing temperature of the liquid nitrogen load over time. The\nresults are currently similar to those from OCRA-p installed on the telescope; see\nFigure 4.7.\nThe comparison of the output voltage from the detectors when looking at a room\ntemperature (\u223c290 K) and liquid nitrogen-soaked (\u223c77 K) absorber provided the sys-\n\n203\n\n\f6: OCRA-FARADAY\n\n10000\n\n10000\n\n100\n\n100\n1\nPower (arbitrary scale)\n\nPower (arbitrary scale)\n\n1\n0.01\n0.0001\n1e-06\n1e-08\n\n0.01\n0.0001\n1e-06\n1e-08\n\n1e-10\n\n1e-10\n\n1e-12\n\n0.1\n\n1\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n10\n\n1e-12\n0.01\n\n100\n\n10000\n\n10000\n\n100\n\n100\n\n1\n\n1\n\nPower (arbitrary scale)\n\nPower (arbitrary scale)\n\n1e-14\n0.01\n\n0.01\n0.0001\n1e-06\n\n1\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n10\n\n100\n\n0.1\n\n1\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n10\n\n100\n\n0.01\n0.0001\n\n1e-08\n1e-10\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1e-06\n1e-08\n\n0.1\n\n1\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1e-10\n0.01\n\nFigure 6.15: The noise spectrum of the OCRA-F chains as measured in the lab.

The results are broadly consistent with \u223c25-30 K for the\namplifiers and the same from the window. Compare with the specifications in Table\n6.1.\ntem temperatures for the receiver chains simultaneously for the first time, albeit with\nthe caveat noted above regarding the linearity of the detectors. These are given in Table 6.4; the results are broadly consistent with \u223c25-30 K for the amplifiers and the\nsame from the window. Assuming that a further 15 K will be contributed from the\natmosphere (as per Section 5.1), then this means that OCRA-F will have at least a sensitivity of around 10 mJy s1/2 per receiver chain, using a total system temperature of\n95 K. This will then be improved once the lower loss foam window is installed on the\nreceiver.\n\n204\n\n\f6.4: COMMISSIONING\n\nAlthough the performance of OCRA-F was not as good as desired, due to the lack\nof fine tuning and the noisy window, the decision was made to install OCRA-F on\nthe telescope and fine-tune afterwards. This approach has several advantages. First,\nit allows direct comparison of OCRA-F with OCRA-p, looking at the same atmosphere. Second, the atmosphere provides a colder and more stable cold load than\nliquid nitrogen-soaked absorber. This means that it can be used for longer and more\neasily repeatable measurements of the knee frequency can be made. Third, it means\nthat measurements of strong astronomical sources can be performed with OCRA-F,\nwhich can provide direct measurements of the sensitivity of the receiver in flux density, as well as testing the shape of the beam of OCRA-F. OCRA-F was installed on\nthe Toru\u0144 telescope on 7 December 2009, and cooled on the telescope the following\nday. Figure 6.16 shows the receiver being lifted onto the telescope, and it installed in\na field rotator.\nDue to the rotation of the sky, the angle of the pair of beams on the sky changes\nover time, which can complicate both long integrations of sources (particularly SZ\nclusters) and the creation of maps of the sky. A field rotator, which rotates the receiver\nthus changing the angle of the beam pair with respect to the sky, can be used to remove\nthese effects. Such a rotator was constructed at TCfA and consists of a rack-and-pinion\nring attached to the ceiling of the secondary focus of the telescope that can be rotated\nusing a small motor. The receiver is then connected to this using a load-bearing cage\nsurrounding OCRA-F, with the power supply and data acquisition system installed at\nthe base of the cage. The angle of the receiver will be measured by an encoder, whose\noutput will then be recorded by the DAQ. At present the field rotator is at a fixed angle\nfor the initial commissioning tests.\nAfter installation, the telescope was pointed towards the Sun to test that the receiver\nwas operational and to start the process of determining the beam offsets. Figure 6.17\nshows the output recorded by the DAQ during these observations, which are the first\nastronomical light observations with OCRA-F.\nA large amount of work remains to be done with OCRA-F now that it is installed\n\n205\n\n\f6: OCRA-FARADAY\n\nFigure 6.16: OCRA-F being installed on the Toru\u0144 telescope. Left: being lifted up\nonto the telescope. Right: OCRA-F mounted in the field rotator.\n\non the telescope. An ongoing series of noise tests and bias optimization needs to be\ncarried out to get the most out of the receiver; in addition the new window constructed\nusing the less noisy foam needs to be installed on the cryostat. A calibration diode\nsystem is currently being constructed by E. Pazderski, to be installed at the primary\nfocus of the telescope; until this is installed OCRA-F will have to use astronomical\nsources for secondary calibration. Finally, there is a lot of integration work remaining\nto do, linking the instrument completely to the telescope control system. This work\nwill be carried out over the next few months; OCRA-F should be fully operational by\naround April 2010.\n\n206\n\n\f6.5: POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS AND EXTENSIONS\n\nFigure 6.17: First astronomical light observations with OCRA-F, looking at the Sun.\nThe vertical scale is reversed: more negative means more received signal.The receiver\nstarted off-source, moving onto the Sun at 13:19:50 then off at 21:30, become coming\nback on at 22:20. At 24:10 the receiver was positioned half on, half off, the Sun such\nthat four of the eight outputs still see a large signal whilst the other four do not.\n\n6.5\n\nPotential improvements and extensions\n\nOCRA-F has provided a transition between using a single pair, and using several pairs\nof receivers. However, there is still a substantial way to go before construction of a\n100-beam receiver becomes feasible. From the experience of constructing and testing\nOCRA-F, there are a number of improvements that could potentially be made to the\nreceiver design. These are described in Section 6.5.1. The next step for the OCRA-F\nreceiver is to increase the number of pixels to its design capacity of 16 beams; the\nsteps towards doing this are discussed in Section 6.5.2. The receiver chain structure\nused within OCRA-F and OCRA-p could also be modified to carry out total power\nand/or spectral observations; these possibilities are discussed in Sections 6.5.3 and\n6.5.4.\n\n207\n\n\f6: OCRA-FARADAY\n\n6.5.1\n\nPotential design improvements\n\nIt became apparent during the testing and commissioning of OCRA-F that there are\na number of elements that could potentially be improved from the design of OCRAF that would either simplify the physical layout of the receiver or provide improved\nperformance. These are summarized below.\nThere are indications that the design of the FEMs could be improved to reduce\nthe noise levels of the receiver: tests of the amplifiers for the 30 GHz receivers for\nthe QUIJOTE experiment (Rubino-Martin et al. 2008), which currently uses the same\nMMIC LNAs as OCRA-F, showed that the MMICs can give temperatures of \u223c 15 K;\ni.e. 10 K lower than those in OCRA-F. One suggestion is to reduce the length of the\ninput lines in front of the amplifiers (E. Blackhurst, private communication).\nIt may also be possible to improve the performance of the amplifiers by using a\nhybrid MIC-MMIC design with a MIC transistor as the first stage within the amplifier,\nfollowed by a MMIC to provide the remaining amplification. The noise of an amplifier\ndepends crucially on the first transistor within the amplifier; as MIC technology currently provides lower noise transistors than MMIC technology, a hybrid design would\nboth enable improved noise performance whilst keeping the increased modularity, and\nhence ease of construction, provided by the MMIC chips.\nModularization of the FEM could assist with the testing of the module, and also\nreduce the number of MMICs used during the matching process of the amplifier pair.\nWithin OCRA-F, all of the components are glued to the body of the FEM, whereas\nputting them on carriers \u2013 or using separate modules for each component \u2013 would enable the testing of individual components at any point in the construction and testing\nprocess. Modularization would also allow for improved matching between the components, and easier replacement in the case of failures. Some modularization took place\nto a limited extent with a later FEM constructed for the QUIJOTE instrument, albeit\nonly with the hybrids rather than the vital amplifiers.\nInteractions between the front and back end modules of OCRA-F could be miti-\n\n208\n\n\f6.5: POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS AND EXTENSIONS\n\ngated by inserting an isolator between the two modules. Due to the layout and waveguide design used within OCRA-F, isolators cannot easily be retroactively fitted; they\nneed to be considered during the design stages of such instruments. Additionally, optimal positioning of the modules and waveguide flanges can simplify the design within\nthe cryostat. The amplifier modules in OCRA-F are orientated vertically, requiring\nexpensive, curved interconnecting waveguides to transfer the RF signals. If the modules were instead positioned horizontally, with the output on the opposite face from the\ninput, simple straight connecting waveguides could be used.\n\n6.5.2\n\nIncreased number of pixels\n\nAlthough OCRA-F was constructed to have 16 pixels, only 8 of these are currently\npopulated. The logical extension of OCRA-F would be to populate the other 8 pixels.\nThis will require the construction of four more FEMs and BEMs, as well as the addition of the appropriate infrastructure within the cryostat (electrical wiring, etc.). The\ncryostat would ideally also be modified at the same time to have a more robust internal\nsupport structure. Additional filters, detectors and power supply modules would also\nbe required, as would further investigation of the foam window to remove the necessity for the window support plate. The cost of such an extension would be minimal\ncompared with developing a complete independent receiver system.\nThe ultimate aim for the OCRA program is to design and construct a 100 beam\ninstrument (Browne et al. 2000). This will involve a considerable amount of work\nin terms of designing a cryostat (or a set of closely packed cryostats) that occupies so\nmuch of the focal plane array of a telescope. Experience from the relocation of OCRAp to the side of the focal plane of the Toru\u0144 telescope to make space for OCRA-F has\nshown that it will be necessary to curve the array of horns to follow the focal surface\nfor optimum performance, rather than having them in a flat array (this will of course\nbe different from horns looking directly at the sky rather than being mounted on a telescope). An investigation into the design requirements and configuration of such \"radio\n\n209\n\n\f6: OCRA-FARADAY\n\ncameras\" is currently being investigated by the EC Framework 7 APRICOT (All Purpose Radio Imaging Cameras On Telescopes) project within the RadioNet consortium.\n\n6.5.3\n\nTotal power radiometer chains\n\nThe OCRA receivers currently difference one beam from the other to measure the differential power from the sky. This mitigates effects from atmospheric fluctuations,\nhowever it greatly increases the difficulty of carrying out measurements of extended\nemission on scales larger than the separation between the beams. With an array of\nreceivers, the atmospheric effects could potentially be removed in software by looking\nfor common atmospheric modes between adjacent beams instead. In order to continue\nremoving the effects of 1/ f gain fluctuations from the amplifiers, the difference between a cold load and a beam could be taken, as is done by the LFI receivers on the\nPlanck satellite.\nThe degree to which this approach would be effective in removing atmospheric\nfluctuations can be simulated by extending the UMBRELLA software package to include cold loads in place of receiver horns. This would also enable an investigation of\nthe analysis steps required to optimally utilize the atmospheric information provided\nby an array of total power receivers.\n\n6.5.4\n\nSpectral bands and lines\n\nThe back end of the OCRA receivers could be easily modified with the introduction of\nfilter banks. The output signal from the BEMs could be split into 4 to 5 frequency channels with the aid of a power splitter and a set of filters, which could then be measured\nsimultaneously. This would provide an instantaneous measurement of the spectral indices of radio sources. It will also provide additional information on the atmospheric\nfluctuations in front of the receiver, as these fluctuations will be strongest at the lower\nend of the frequency range due to the water vapour line at 22 GHz. The frequency bins\ncould be recombined in software to allow for more accurate measurements of weaker\n\n210\n\n\f6.6: SUMMARY\n\nsources, so long as the frequency bins do not severely overlap and any correlations\nbetween the frequency bins are taken into account.\nThe current OCRA-F DAQ was designed to support 16 channels, of which 10 are\ncurrently in use (8 channels are used for the receiver outputs, one for the phase switch\nsignal and one for the time). As a result, one of the OCRA-F chains could be converted\nto give 2 \u00d7 4 binned outputs, and the only modifications to the DAQ that would be\nrequired would be in software. The additional hardware required would be a pair of\nRF power splitters, two sets of filters, additional detectors and video amplifiers, all of\nwhich would be placed outside the cryostat.\nThe above would provide discrete frequency bins each with wide (\u223c 2 GHz) bandwidth; a further improvement would be to use a local oscillator to reduce the frequency\nof the signals, which could then be sampled using a high-speed DAQ. The signal could\nthen be Fourier transformed to provide spectral line measurements. Observations of\nspectral lines could then be carried out during periods when the weather does not permit continuum flux density measurements. An array of such receivers could potentially\nbe used to create large-scale maps of spectral line emission for follow-up with highresolution interferometers such as the Very Large Array (VLA) or the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA).\n\n6.6\n\nSummary\n\nThis chapter has described the testing of the components within the OCRA-F receiver\nand their assembly into the complete cryostat. Following this, the testing of the receiver\nin the field at JBO and at TCfA was described, as was the installation of OCRA-F\non the Toru\u0144 32-m telescope and the first steps in the process of commissioning the\nreceiver. Potential improvements and extensions of the OCRA receivers, including\nadding total power, spectral bin and spectral line capabilities, were also discussed.\nA number of issues were discovered and mitigated during the testing of the receiver\nchains. The gain of OCRA-F contains ripples caused by interactions between the FEM\n\n211\n\n\f6: OCRA-FARADAY\n\nand the BEM; this can be mitigated by changing bias settings of the amplifiers, and\nit does not have a significant effect on the receiver performance due to the continuum\nnature of the receiver. The detectors become non-linear in the presence of a room temperature load and the maximum gain from the amplifiers; this is mitigated by reducing\nthe gain of the amplifiers, and should not be a problem for measuring astronomical\nsources due to the low apparent temperature loads from these sources. Finally, the\nlossy vacuum window material used within OCRA-F increases its system temperature;\na window made of a different, less-lossy type of foam has been constructed and tested,\nand will be installed on OCRA-F in the near future.\nThe OCRA-F receiver will be optimized over the next few months via testing on\nthe telescope, and should be fully operational and carrying out astronomical surveys\nby around April 2010.\n\n212\n\n\f7\nConclusions and future work\n7.1\n\nVirtual Sky simulations\n\nWe have simulated the microwave sky, creating maps consisting of the Cosmic Microwave Background, galaxy clusters via the SZ effect and foreground point sources.\nSimulated cluster catalogues can be created by analytical formulae, N-body simulations and using Pinocchio simulations. A galaxy cluster model can then be applied\nto turn these catalogues into maps of the SZ effect. Point sources \u2013 both low- and\nhigh-frequency \u2013 can be added to the maps, including distributing the point sources\naccording to the surface matter density of the galaxy clusters.\nMaking use of the tools set in place for these simulations, we examine the expected\npolarized power spectrum for point sources based upon polarized, high frequency VLA\nobservations by Jackson et al. (2009) of a sample of WMAP-detected point sources.\nWe find that point source subtraction will be vital for upcoming low frequency B-mode\nexperiments that are sensitive to values of the tensor-to-scalar ratio r of less than 0.1,\nand less than 0.01 for all frequencies.\nUsing virtual sky maps created from large numbers of cluster catalogues generated\nby Pinocchio for three different values of \u03c38 , we have investigated the statistics of the\npower spectrum between multipoles of 1000 and 10000. We find that the inclusion of\n\n213\n\n\f7: CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\n\nthe SZ effect increases the standard deviation of the power spectrum by a factor of 3\nover that expected from cosmic variance, in agreement with the predictions from an\nanalytical calculation based on the halo formalism. The mean and standard deviation\n1/2\nvary as 1/ fsky\nas expected, and scale approximately as \u03c378 over the range of values\n\nsampled here. We also find that the distributions are non-Gaussian, and are skewed\nby large mass clusters, with the degree of this skewness increasing as the map size is\ndecreased. Additionally, we find that correlations between galaxy clusters play a small\nrole in the statistics of the power spectrum at the level of \u223c10 per cent.\nSeveral instruments have measured an excess at high multipoles, which may be\ndue to the SZ effect with a large value of \u03c38 . We cannot explain the central values\nof these measurements with the range of \u03c38 investigated here, however the increased\nstandard deviation and the presence of skewness in the distribution means that these\nmeasurements could be explained by a lower value of \u03c38 than has been suggested\nso far. There is also a large uncertainty in the parameters describing the cluster gas\nphysics, which can have a large effect on the mean of the distributions, comparable\nto that from the different values of \u03c38 , and can also significantly effect the standard\ndeviation and the skew of the distributions.\nThe next generation of CMB instruments are currently being commissioned, and\nare expected to provide more data at multipoles comparable to those probed by the\nCBI. The Planck spacecraft will measure the power spectrum from the whole sky out\nto multipoles of 2500 within the next few years, and instruments such as the South\nPole Telescope (SPT; Ruhl et al. 2004), the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager (AMI;\nZwart et al. 2008) and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT; Fowler 2004) will\nobserve large numbers of galaxy clusters using the SZ effect. These measurements\nwill provide much more information on the SZ effect and may provide a resolution\nto the discrepancy in \u03c38 from the measurements to date. Our results should also be\nrelevant to these observations.\nFurther virtual sky simulations can be carried out to investigate the behaviour of the\nSZ effect on lower multipoles using full sky maps. Both these simulations and those on\n\n214\n\n\f7.2: OCRA SIMULATIONS AND OBSERVATIONS\n\nsmaller map sizes can be used to estimate the increase in cosmological parameter error\nbars due to contamination of observations of the CMB by the SZ effect. Additionally,\nthe maps can be combined with simulations of specific experiments to forecast their\ncapabilities for observing the SZ effect, or when treating the SZ effect as a foreground\nto the CMB, and they can be used to investigate optimal approaches to detecting SZ\nclusters.\n\n7.2\n\nOCRA simulations and observations\n\nWe have extended the UMBRELLA simulations of the OCRA-p receiver mounted on\na telescope observing through atmosphere, created by Lowe (2006), to incorporate\nautomated data reduction (which can also be used for real observations) and to be able\nto observe Virtual Sky maps. Using this software to simulate the system from end\nto end, we have investigated the statistics of point source observations with OCRAp, examining the capabilities of the receiver for observing using cross-scan and onoff measurements. We find that these simulations are able to realistically simulate\nthe noise present in real observations, and that the introduction of 1/ f noise into the\nsimulations significantly reduces the predicted ability of the instruments to observe\nweak sources by integrating for long periods of time.\nIn order to aid the subtraction of individual sources from the VSA fields observed\nat \u223c30 GHz, and to obtain a statistical estimate of the surface density of sources at\n30 GHz, we have observed a sample of 121 sources using the OCRA-p receiver on the\nToru\u0144 32-m telescope; the sample was selected at 15 GHz with the RT. At 30 GHz,\nwe detected 57 sources above a limiting flux density of \u223c 5 mJy. This is the deepest\nfollow-up of any complete sample of sources detected at 15 GHz by the RT.\nAt a flux density of 10 mJy, which is our estimated completeness limit, we derive a\nsurface density of sources at 30 GHz of 2.0 \u00b1 0.4 per square degree. This is consistent\nwith the value obtained by Mason et al. (2009), who observed a much larger sample\nof sources down to mJy levels but selected at a much lower frequency (1.4 GHz). The\n\n215\n\n\f7: CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\n\npotential danger of using low frequency selected samples is that there may exist a\nsignificant population of sources with steeply rising spectra towards high frequencies\nthat are not present in the low frequency surveys. As the two surface density estimates\nare consistent, this indicates that such a population is not obviously present at the\n10 mJy level.\nWe have compared our flux density measurements with those from the VSA source\nsubtractor and VLA measurements. These comparisons give confidence in our flux\ndensity scale but reveal that a significant fraction of sources are variable on a timescale\nof a few years, some at the level of a factor of 2. This shows the importance of taking\ncontemporaneous measurements of discrete sources in conjunction with measurements\nof the CMB.\nWe have also investigated the dependence of the spectral index distribution on\nflux density by comparing our measured spectral index distribution with that for much\nstronger sources (above 1 Jy) selected from the WMAP 22 GHz catalogue. We conclude that the proportion of steep spectrum sources increases with decreasing flux density. This is qualitatively consistent with models of source populations, for example de\nZotti et al. (2005).\nAgain using OCRA-p, we have also surveyed 550 flat spectrum radio sources\naround the North Ecliptic Pole from the CRATES sample, which were selected based\non their 1.4-4.8 GHz spectral index. These follow from the observation of the CJF\nsources by Lowe (2006); Lowe et al. (2007), and extend the work to lower flux densities.\nWe find reasonable agreement between the measurements presented here and those\nby Lowe et al. (2007) and also WMAP (Wright et al. 2009) where sources are in\ncommon between the samples. A number of sources display variability between these\nthree sets of observations, and also within the present measurements. This will present\ndifficulties when subtracting these point sources from maps of the CMB.\nAs expected, we find that the spectral index distribution for these sources broadens\nat higher frequencies as the source spectral indices steepen. We find that there are a\n\n216\n\n\f7.3: RADIO CAMERAS\n\nreasonable number (5.6 per cent) of Gigahertz-Peaked Sources, and also a number of\ninverted sources (\u223c 10 per cent). We conclude that extrapolation from low frequency\nflux densities to higher frequencies assuming power law spectra is unreliable. This emphasizes the need for high-frequency blind surveys to low flux densities. Such surveys\nare currently being carried out by the ATCA at 20 GHz in the southern hemisphere (see\ne.g. Sadler et al. 2007) and AMI at 15 GHz in the northern hemisphere (Waldram &\nPooley 2004; Waldram et al. 2009), and will be carried out by the OCRA-F instrument\nand its successors at 30 GHz in the near future.\nThe flux densities of the sources within the CRATES subsample described here\nwill be useful for comparison to point source measurements by the Planck satellite,\nwhich will be most sensitive in the area of sky surveyed here. Due to the flat spectrum\nnature of these sources, they are the most likely sources to appear in all of the different\nobservational bands of Planck. An Early Release Point Source Catalogue from Planck\nis expected in December 2010 (Bouchet 2009), at which point such a comparison can\nbe carried out.\n\n7.3\n\nRadio cameras\n\nThe OCRA-F receiver has been tested at the individual component level, assembled\ninto a complete cryostat and tested in the field at JBO and at TCfA. The receiver was\ninstalled on the Toru\u0144 32-m telescope, and the first steps in the process of commissioning the receiver have been taken. The OCRA-F receiver will be optimized over\nthe next few months via testing on the telescope, and should be fully operational and\ncarrying out astronomical surveys by around April 2010.\nA number of issues were discovered and mitigated during the testing of the receiver\nchains. The gain of OCRA-F contains ripples caused by interactions between the FEM\nand the BEM; this can be mitigated by changing bias settings of the amplifiers, and\nit does not have a significant effect on the receiver performance due to the continuum\nnature of the receiver. The detectors become non-linear in the presence of a room tem-\n\n217\n\n\f7: CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\n\nperature load and the maximum gain from the amplifiers; this is mitigated by reducing\nthe gain of the amplifiers, and should not be a problem for measuring astronomical\nsources due to the low apparent temperature loads from these sources. Finally, the\nlossy vacuum window material used within OCRA-F increases its system temperature;\na window made of a different, less-lossy type of foam has been constructed and tested,\nand will be installed on OCRA-F in the near future.\nLooking to the future, the next step towards a fully-fledged radio camera from the\nOCRA programme of receivers is the completion of OCRA-F with the addition of the\nremaining four receiver modules to bring it up to its design capacity of 16 beams.\nThis will enable the development and real-life testing of observation methodologies\nfor surveying the sky at these frequencies using a ground-based instrument.\nOver the next few years, the APRICOT programme will be exploring the required\ntechnology for larger, multi-purpose arrays of radio receivers, looking also at polarization and spectral line studies. Information from this can then be used to start the\ndevelopment of the complete, 100-beam OCRA receiver.\nWith the installation of OCRA-F on the Toru\u01f9 telescope, blind surveys for point\nsources can be started in the near future. Following from the CRATES observations,\na blind survey of this section of the sky using OCRA-F will be started, with a target\nof finding all point sources at 30 GHz down to a flux density of \u223c 10 mJy over a large\narea of the sky.\nInterweaved with these observations, OCRA-F will be used to observe a deep field\nto high sensitivity with the aim of detecting SZ clusters in a small blind survey. Depending on the performance of the receiver, this may also lead to observations of the\nCBI excess using the same field. It will be vital to carry out further simulations of the\nOCRA instruments, based on the combination of Virtual Sky, UMBRELLA and the\nautomated data reduction software, to investigate the optimal approaches to carrying\nout these surveys.\nAs the number of microwave frequency receivers mounted on a telescope is increased, the amount of sky that surveys with that telescope can cover will dramatically\n\n218\n\n\f7.3: RADIO CAMERAS\n\nincrease, as will the sensitivity of those surveys. Ultimately, blind surveys of SZ clusters will be able to provide measurements of the cosmological parameters \u03a9m , \u03c38 and\nw that are complementary to those from observations of the CMB and supernovae.\nThis will ultimately increase our knowledge of dark matter and dark energy, as well as\nthe evolution of our Universe.\n\n219\n\n\f7: CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\n\n220\n\n\fAppendix A\nFlux densities and spectra for sources\nwithin the CRATES subsample\nTable A.1: Flux densities (in mJy) for the CRATES sources.
