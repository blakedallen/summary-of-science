The modifications in the effective potential\nand their consequences for the bubble nucleation process are discussed.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIt is commonly accepted that QCD at sufficiently high temperatures undergoes a phase transition to a new state of\nmatter, the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), which was presumably present in the early universe [1, 2]. Compelling lattice\nQCD results corroborate this belief [3], and experiments in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions [4, 5] at BNL-RHIC\nhave recently shown data that clearly point to a new state of matter [6].\nTo model the mechanism of chiral symmetry breaking present in QCD, and to study the dynamics of phase conversion after a temperature-driven chiral transition, one can resort to low-energy effective models [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,\n13, 14, 15, 16]. In particular, to study the mechanisms of bubble nucleation and spinodal decomposition in a hot\nexpanding plasma [17], it is common to adopt the linear \u03c3-model coupled to quarks [18], where the latter comprise\nthe hydrodynamic degrees of freedom of the system. The gas of quarks provides a thermal bath in which the longwavelength modes of the chiral field evolve, and the latter plays the role of an order parameter in a Landau-Ginzburg\napproach to the description of the chiral phase transition [11, 12, 13, 14]. The standard procedure is then integrating\nover the fermionic degrees of freedom, using a classical approximation for the chiral field, to obtain a formal expression\nfor the thermodynamic potential:\n\u0015\n\u0014 \u22121\nT\n(GE + M (\u03c6))\n,\n(1)\n\u03a9(T, \u03bc, \u03c6) = V (\u03c6) \u2212 ln det\nV\nT\nwhere V (\u03c6) is the classical self-interaction potential for the bosonic sector, GE is the fermionic Euclidean propagator,\nM (\u03c6) is the effective fermion mass in the presence of the chiral field background, T is the temperature and V is the\nvolume of the system. From the thermodynamic potential (1), one can obtain all the physical quantities of interest.\nTo actually compute correlation functions and thermodynamic quantities, one has to evaluate the fermionic determinant that results from the functional integration over the quark fields within some approximation scheme.\nAlternatively, one can consider the fermionic density which will appear as a source term in the equation of motion\nfor the chiral field. In the case of one-dimensional systems one can often resort to exact analytical methods, such as\nthe inverse scattering technique [19]. In practice, however, the determinant is usually calculated to one-loop order\nassuming a homogeneous and static background field [20]. Nevertheless, for a system that is in the process of phase\nconversion after a chiral transition, one expects inhomogeneities in the chiral field configuration due to fluctuations to\nplay a major role in driving the system to the true ground state. Hence, their effects should in principle be included\nin the computation of the fermionic determinant.\nIn the case of high-energy heavy ion collisions, hydrodynamical studies have shown that significant density inhomogeneities may develop dynamically when the chiral transition to the broken symmetry phase takes place [13] (see\nalso [12] for an analysis in a different context). Their pattern and intensity might indeed provide some insight on\nthe nature of the transition as well as on the location of an eventual critical point. If the freeze-out in heavy ion\ncollisions occurs shortly after a first-order chiral transition, inhomogeneities generated during the late stages of the\nnonequilibrium evolution of the order parameter might leave imprints on the final spatial distributions and even on\nthe integrated, inclusive abundances [21].\nIn this paper we consider an approximation procedure to evaluate the finite-temperature fermionic density in the\npresence of a chiral background field which systematically incorporates effects from inhomogeneities in the bosonic\nfield through a gradient expansion. The method is valid for the case in which the chiral field varies smoothly, and\nallows one to extract information from its long-wavelength behavior, incorporating corrections order by order in the\nderivatives of the field [22]. This approach has been successfully used to treat systems of low-dimensionality at zero\ntemperature in condensed matter physics [23]. Here we consider a three-dimensional system at finite temperature. We\napply the method to the case of the linear \u03c3-model coupled to quarks, which provides a convenient framework for the\n\n\f2\nstudy of bubble nucleation and spinodal decomposition in the case of a first-order chiral transition. Nevertheless, the\nresults presented below are quite general and may be of interest also in cosmology or in condensed matter systems.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section II presents briefly the low-energy effective model adopted in this paper.\nIn Section III we introduce the method to incorporate systematically effects from inhomogeneities in the chiral field\nin the computation of the fermionic density. Results for the (well-known) leading term and for the first non-trivial\ncorrections are discussed in Section IV. There, we also consider the modifications undergone by the effective potential\nand their consequences to the process of nucleation. Section V contains our final remarks.\nII.\n\nEFFECTIVE MODEL\n\nLet us consider a scalar field \u03c6 coupled to fermions \u03c8 according to the Lagrangian\n1\nL = \u03c8[i\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc + \u03bc\u03b3 0 \u2212 M (\u03c6)]\u03c8 + \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u2202 \u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 V (\u03c6) .\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03bc is the fermionic chemical potential, M (\u03c6) is the effective mass of the fermions and V (\u03c6) is a self-interaction\npotential for the bosonic field.\nIn the case of the linear \u03c3-model coupled to quarks, \u03c6 represents the \u03c3 direction of the chiral field \u03a6 = (\u03c3, ~\u03c0 ), where\n\u03c0 i are pseudoscalar fields playing the role of the pions, which we drop here for simplicity. The pion directions play no\nmajor role in the process of phase conversion we have in mind, as was argued in Ref. [11], so we focus on the sigma\ndirection in what follows. However, the coupling of pions to the quark fields might be quantitatively important in the\ncomputation of the fermionic determinant inhomogeneity corrections. This issue makes the computation technically\nmore involved and will be addressed in a future publication. The field \u03c8 plays the role of the constituent-quark\nfield q = (u, d), and \u03bc = \u03bcq is the quark chemical potential. The \"effective mass\" is given by M (\u03c6) = g|\u03c3|, and\nV (\u03a6) = (\u03bb2 /4)(\u03c3 2 + ~\u03c0 2 \u2212 v 2 )2 \u2212 hq \u03c3 is the self-interaction potential for \u03a6. The parameters above are chosen such\nthat chiral SUL (2) \u2297 SUR (2) symmetry is spontaneously broken in the vacuum. The vacuum expectation values of\nthe condensates are h\u03c3i = f\u03c0 and h~\u03c0 i = 0, where f\u03c0 = 93 MeV is the pion decay constant. The explicit symmetry\nbreaking term is due to the finite current-quark masses and is determined by the PCAC relation, giving hq = f\u03c0 m2\u03c0 ,\nwhere m\u03c0 = 138 MeV is the pion mass. This yields v 2 = f\u03c02 \u2212 m2\u03c0 /\u03bb2 . The value of \u03bb2 = 20 leads to a \u03c3-mass,\nm2\u03c3 = 2\u03bb2 f\u03c02 + m2\u03c0 , equal to 600 MeV. In\u221amean field theory, the purely bosonic part of this Lagrangian exhibits a\nsecond-order phase transition [24] at Tc = 2v if the explicit symmetry breaking term, hq , is dropped. For hq 6= 0, the\ntransition becomes a smooth crossover from the restored to broken symmetry phases. For g > 0, one has to include a\nfinite-temperature one-loop contribution from the quark fermionic determinant to the effective potential as indicated\nin Eq. (1). When the coupling between quarks and the chiral field, g, is large enough, the system exhibits a first-order\nphase transition even at \u03bc = 0 [9, 11, 13]. When we decrease g, the strength of this first-order transition is weakened.\nAt g \u2248 3.7, the latent heat vanishes and we have a second-order critical point at \u03bc = 0. In what follows we keep\nthe explicit symmetry breaking term hq \u03c3 and consider the case g = 5.5, where the first-order line goes all the way\ndown to \u03bc = 0, since we are mainly concerned with the effects from inhomogeneities in the process of homogeneous\nnucleation.\nThe Euler-Lagrange equation for static chiral field configurations contains a term which represents the fermionic\ndensity, \u03c1 :\n\u22072 \u03c6 =\n\n\u2202V\n+ g\u03c1(T, \u03bc, \u03c6) ,\n\u2202\u03c6\n\nand the density of fermions at a given point ~x0 has the form\n\u001d\n\u001c\n1\n~x0 ,\n\u03c1(~x0 ) = Sp ~x0 \u22121\nGE + M (x\u0302)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nwhere |~x0 i is a position eigenstate with eigenvalue ~x0 , and Sp represents a trace over fermionic degrees of freedom,\nsuch as color, spin and isospin.\nAssuming a homogeneous background field, one can compute the one-loop fermionic density in a simple way [20]. In\nthis case, the correction coming from the integration over the fermions can be directly incorporated into an effective\npotential for the chiral field, as will be shown below. However, perfect homogeneity is a very strong hypothesis if\none is interested in the dynamics of a phase transition. On the other hand, the correct determinant would have to\nbe computed with an arbitrary profile for the background field. In a few examples, one can do it formally for onedimensional systems [19]. For higher dimensions, however, one must adopt some approximation scheme to take into\n\n\f3\naccount inhomogeneity effects. In the next section, we present a framework to incorporate systematically derivative\ncorrections to the density \u03c1(~x). The only assumption made on the behavior of the background field is that it varies\nvery smoothly.\nIII.\n\nINHOMOGENEITY CORRECTIONS\n\nIn order to take into account inhomogeneity effects of the chiral background field, \u03c6, encoded in the position\ndependence of M in (4), we resort to a derivative expansion as explained below.\nIn momentum representation, the expression for the fermionic density assumes the form\nX Z d3 k\n1\n~\n~\n\u03c1(~x0 ) = Sp T\ne\u2212ik*~x0\n(5)\neik*~x0 ,\n3\n0 (i\u03c9 + \u03bc) \u2212 ~\n~\n(2\u03c0)\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\n*\nk\n+\nM\n(x\u0302)\nn\nn\nwhere \u03c9n = (2n + 1)\u03c0T are Matsubara frequencies for fermions [20]. One can transfer the ~x0 dependence to M (x\u0302)\nthrough a unitary transformation, obtaining\nX Z d3 k\n1\n\u03c1(~x0 ) = Sp T\n,\n(6)\n3 0\n(2\u03c0)\n\u03b3 (i\u03c9n + \u03bc) \u2212 ~\u03b3 * ~k + M (x\u0302 + ~x0 )\nn\nwhere one should notice that ~x0 is a c-number, not an operator.\nNow we expand M (x\u0302 + ~x0 ) around ~x0 :\nM (x\u0302 + ~x0 ) \u2261 M (~x0 ) + \u2206M (x\u0302, ~x0 ) =\n\n1\nM (~x0 ) + \u2207i M (~x0 )x\u0302i + \u2207i \u2207j M (~x0 )x\u0302i x\u0302j + * * * ,\n2\n\n(7)\n\nand use x\u0302i = \u2212i\u2207ki to write\n\u03c1(~x0 ) = Sp T\n\n\"\n#\u22121\n1\n1\nd3 k\n1 + \u2206M (\u2212i\u2207ki , ~x0 )\n.

In particular,\nas will be seen below, the first non-trivial inhomogeneity contribution will modify the Laplacian term in Eq. (3), and\ncan be seen as a correction to the surface tension in the process of bubble nucleation.\nThis is a quite general method to approximate the fermionic density and could be used in a variety of low-energy\neffective field theory models for the study of the dynamics of the chiral transition. In the next section we apply this\nmethod to the case of the linear \u03c3-model coupled to quarks.\n\n\f4\nIV.\nA.\n\nRESULTS\nLeading term\n\nThe leading-order term in this gradient expansion for \u03c1(~x) can be calculated in the standard fashion [20] and yields\nthe well-known mean field result for the scalar quark density\nZ\nM (\u03c6)/Ek (\u03c6)\nd3 k\n\u03c10 = \u03bdq\n+ (\u03bcq \u2192 \u2212\u03bcq ) ,\n(11)\n(2\u03c0)3 e[Ek (\u03c6)\u2212\u03bcq ]/T + 1\nwhere \u03bdq = 12 is the color-spin-isospin degeneracy factor, Ek (\u03c6) = (~k 2 + M 2 (\u03c6))1/2 , and M (\u03c6) = g|\u03c6| plays the role\nof an effective mass for the quarks. The net effect of this leading term is correcting the potential for the chiral field,\nso that we can rewrite Eq. (3) as\n\u22072 \u03c6 =\n\n\u2202Vef f\n,\n\u2202\u03c6\n\n(12)\n\nwhere Vef f = V (\u03c6) + Vq (\u03c6) and\nVq \u2261 \u2212\u03bdq T\n\nZ\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nd3 k\nln e[Ek (\u03c6)\u2212\u03bcq ]/T + 1 + (\u03bcq \u2192 \u2212\u03bcq ) .\n3\n(2\u03c0)\n\n(13)\n\nThe potentials Vq and Vef f for several values of the temperature (at \u03bcq = 0) are displayed in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2,\nrespectively, assuming g = 5.5. In this case, the chiral phase transition is of first order even for a vanishing chemical\npotential, and Tc \u2248 124 MeV.

From the modified field equation (12), one can study, for instance, the phenomena of bubble\nnucleation and spinodal decomposition. However, the presence of a non-trivial background field configuration, e.g. a\nbubble, can in principle dramatically modify the Dirac spectrum [25], hence the determinant. In the case of condensed\nmatter systems, where electronic doping often plays a major role, the presence of fermionic bound states can deeply\naffect the dynamics of the phase transition. This is the case in the presence of a bubble background, where besides\nunstable critical bubbles one can find metastable configurations, depending on the relative occupation of bound states,\nand a modification in the value of the nucleation rate [19, 26, 27]. In the case of a chiral model, analogous effects\ncan in principle appear for a nonzero quark chemical potential. In any case, one expects the effective potential to be\nmodified by the effect of fluctuations of the chiral field on the fermionic density, which motivates the investigation of\nthe next term in the expansion, which contains some information about the inhomogeneity of the bosonic field.\n\n\f5\n\n1\nT = 130 MeV\nT = 124 MeV\nT = 108 MeV\nT = 100 MeV\n\nVeff / T\n\n4\n\n0.5\n0\n-0.5\n-1\n-1.5\n-2\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\n100\n\n75\n\n\u03c6 (MeV)\n\n125\n\nFIG. 2: Vef f (\u03c6) in the \u03c3 direction for different values of the temperature at \u03bcq = 0 and for g = 5.5.\n\nB.\n\nFirst corrections\n\nThe next non-trivial term in the expansion contains two contributions: one coming from \u03c11 and another from \u03c12 .\nThis is due to the rearrangement of powers of the gradient operator.

The derivation of H(Ek , T, \u03bcq ) is not particularly illuminating (a few\nsteps are presented in the appendix). However, in the low-temperature limit, corresponding to \u03b2M >> 1, the integral\nabove is strongly suppressed for high values of k, and the leading term has the much simpler form\n\u221a\n\u03bdq 2\u03c0 \u2212\u03b2|M|\ne\n(\u03b2|M |)3/2 ,\n(17)\nWq (T, \u03bcq , \u03c6) \u2248 2\n\u03c0 8\nwhich gives a a better idea of the profile of the first inhomogeneity correction. One can already anticipate that it will\nbe concentrated in the same region where the homogeneous correction was significant, i.e. \u03b2M < 1 (cf. Fig. 1), being\n\n\f6\n\nFIG. 3: gWq (\u03c6) for different values of the temperature at \u03bcq = 0 and for g = 5.5.\n\nexponentially suppressed for higher values of the field. In fact, a numerical study of the complete Wq shows that this\nfunction is peaked around \u03c6 = 0 and non-negligible for \u03b2|\u03c6| < 1 (see Fig. 3).\nThe Euler-Lagrange equation for the chiral field up to this order in the gradient expansion reads\n\u22072 \u03c6 = [1 + gWq (T, \u03bcq , \u03c6)]\u22121\n\n\u2202Vef f (T, \u03bcq , \u03c6)\n\u2032\n\u2261 Vin\n(\u03c6) .\n\u2202\u03c6\n\n(18)\n\nHere we used the fact that (1+gWq ) is a positive definite quantity, and defined a new \"effective potential\" that contains\nall the corrections up to this order in the gradient expansion, Vin . One should not confuse Vin with the standard\ndefinition of the one-loop effective potential in field theory derived for a constant background [28]. Nevertheless, we\nkeep the name effective potential for Vin for convenience in the description of nucleation that follows.\nThe complete new effective potential can be obtained from our previous results by numerical integration. In order to\nproceed analytically, though, we choose to fit its derivative, which we know exactly up to this order, by a polynomial\nof the fifth degree. Actually, we know that the commonly used effective potential, Vef f = V + Vq , can hardly be\ndistinguished from a fit with a polynomial of sixth degree in the region of interest for nucleation [29]. Working with\nfits will be most convenient for using well-known results in the thin-wall approximation to estimate physical quantities\nthat are relevant for nucleation, such as the surface tension and the free energy of the critical bubble. Results for the\n\u2032\nfits of Vin\n(\u03c6) for \u03bcq = 0 are shown in Fig. 4.\n\n2.25\nT = 132 MeV\nT = 124 MeV\nT = 116 MeV\nT = 108 MeV\n\nV'in / T\n\n3\n\n1.5\n0.75\n0\n-0.75\n-1.5\n-2.25\n-0.75\n\n-0.5\n\n-0.25\n\n0\n\n\u03c6/\u03a4\n\n0.25\n\n0.5\n\n0.75\n\n\u2032\nFIG. 4: Fits for Vin\n(\u03c6) for different values of the temperature at \u03bcq = 0 and for g = 5.5. The lines shown in the box correspond\nto the exact results.\n\nWe can now integrate analytically the polynomial approximation to the derivative of the complete effective potential.\nIn Fig. 5 we display the curves for Vef f and Vin for a few values of temperature and \u03bcq = 0.\n\n\f7\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nFIG. 5: Vef f and Vin (\u03c6) for different values of the temperature T = [108 (a), 116 (b), 124 (c), 132 (d)] MeV at \u03bcq = 0 and for\ng = 5.5.\n\nFrom Fig. 5 one can notice a few consequences of the inhomogeneity correction. The first general effect is the\nsmoothening of the effective potential. In particular, and most importantly, the barrier between the symmetric phase\nand the broken phase is significantly diminished, as well as the depth of the broken phase minimum, although we still\nhave a first-order phase transition barrier. Therefore, one can expect an augmentation in the bubble nucleation rate.\nIn principle, one should have better results from calculations within the thin-wall approximation. Also, the critical\ntemperature moves up slightly.\nC.\n\nEffects on nucleation\n\nLet us now consider the effects of the first inhomogeneity correction on the process of phase conversion driven by\nthe nucleation of bubbles [30]. To work with approximate analytic formulas, we follow Ref. [11] and express Vin over\nthe range 0 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 T in the familiar Landau-Ginzburg form\nVeff \u2248\n\n4\nX\n\na n \u03a6n\n\n.\n\n(19)\n\nn=0\n\nAlthough this approximation is obviously incapable of reproducing all three minima of Vin , this polynomial form is\nfound to provide a good quantitative description of Vin in the region of interest for nucleation, i.e. where the minima\nfor the symmetric and broken phases, as well as the barrier between them, are located.\n\n\f8\nA quartic potential such as Eq. (19) can always be rewritten in the form\nU (\u03c6) = \u03b1 (\u03c62 \u2212 a2 )2 + j\u03c6\n\n.\n\n(20)\n\nThe coefficients above are defined as follows:\n\u03b1 = a4 ,\n\"\n\u0012 \u00132 #\n1\na2\n3 a3\n2\na =\n\u2212 +\n,\n2\na4\n8 a4\n\"\n\u0012 \u00133 #\n1 a2 a3\n1 a3\na1\n\u2212\n+\nj = a4\na4\n2 a4 a4\n8 a4\n\u03c6 = \u03c6+\n\n(21)\n(22)\n,\n\n1 a3\n.\n4 a4\n\n(23)\n(24)\n\nThe new potential U (\u03c6) reproduces the original Vin (\u03c6) up to a shift in the zero of energy. We are interested in the\neffective potential only between Tc and Tsp . At Tc , we will have two distinct minima of equal depth. This clearly\ncorresponds to the choice j = 0 in Eq. (20) so that U has minima at \u03c6 = \u00b1a and a maximum at \u03c6 = 0. The minimum\nat \u03c6 = \u2212a and the maximum\nmove closer together as the temperature is lowered and merge at Tsp . Thus, the spinodal\n\u221a\n\u221a\nrequires j/\u03b1a3 = \u22128/3 3 in Eq. (20). The parameter j/\u03b1a3 falls roughly linearly from 0, at T = Tc , to \u22128/3 3 at\nthe spinodal.\nThe explicit form of the critical bubble in the thin-wall limit is then given by [19]\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\nr \u2212 Rc\n1\n1 \u2212 tanh\n\u03c6c (r; \u03be, Rc ) = \u03c6f + \u221a\n,\n(25)\n\u03be\n\u03be 2\u03b1\nwhere \u03c6f is the new false vacuum, Rc is the radius of the critical bubble, and \u03be = 2/m, with m2 \u2261 U \u2032\u2032 (\u03c6f ), is\na measure of the wall thickness. The thin-wall limit corresponds\nto \u03be/Rc \u226a 1 [19], which can be rewritten as\n\u221a\n(3|j|/8\u03b1a3 ) \u226a 1. This small parameter has the value of 1/ 3 at the spinodal, which suggests that the thin-wall\napproximation might be qualitatively reliable for our purposes. Nevertheless, it was shown in [11] that the thinwall limit becomes very imprecise as one approaches the spinodal. In this vein, the analysis presented below is to\nbe regarded as semi-quantitative. To be consistent we compare results from the homogeneous calculation to those\nincluding the inhomogeneity correction within the same approximation.\nIn terms of the parameters \u03b1, a, and j defined above, we find\nj\n\u03c6t,f \u2248 \u00b1a \u2212\n,\n8\u03b1a2\n#1/2\n\"\n1\n\u03be =\n\u03b1(3\u03c62f \u2212 a2 )\nin the thin-wall limit. Determination of the critical radius requires the surface tension, \u03a3, defined as\n\u00132\n\u0012\nZ \u221e\n2\nd\u03c6b\n\u2248\n.\n\u03a3\u2261\ndr\n3\ndr\n3\u03b1\u03be\n0\n\n(26)\n(27)\n\n(28)\n\nThe critical radius then becomes Rc = (2\u03a3/\u2206U ), where \u2206U \u2261 V (\u03c6f ) \u2212 V (\u03c6t ) \u2248 2a|j|. The free energy of a critical\nbubble is finally given by Fb = (4\u03c0\u03a3/3)Rc2 . From knowledge of Fb , one can evaluate the nucleation rate \u0393 \u223c e\u2212Fb /T .\nIn calculating thin-wall properties, we shall use the approximate forms for \u03c6t , \u03c6f , \u03a3, and \u2206U for all values of the\npotential parameters.\nTo illustrate the effect from the inhomogeneity correction, we compute the critical radius and Fb /T for three\ndifferent values of the temperature. For T = 108 MeV, corresponding to the spinodal temperature, which is not\nmodified by the first inhomogeneity correction, the corrected values are Rc \u2248 0.98 fm and Fb /T \u2248 0.20, as compared\nto Rc \u2248 1.1 fm and Fb /T \u2248 0.9 in the homogeneous case. The same computation for T = 116 MeV yields Rc \u2248 2.15 fm\nand Fb /T \u2248 1.14, as compared to Rc \u2248 2.2 fm and Fb /T \u2248 2.1. At T = 124 MeV, which corresponds to the critical\ntemperature for the homogeneous case, the critical radius and Fb /T diverge in the homogeneous computation, whereas\nRc \u2248 35 fm and Fb /T \u2248 394 including inhomogeneities. The numbers above clearly indicate that the formation of\ncritical bubbles is much less suppressed in the scenario with inhomogeneities, which will in principle accelerate the\nphase conversion process after the chiral transition.\n\n\f9\nV.\n\nSUMMARY AND OUTLOOK\n\nWe have introduced a systematic procedure to evaluate inhomogeneity corrections to the finite-temperature\nfermionic density in the presence of a chiral background field, which incorporates effects from fluctuations in the\nbosonic field through a gradient expansion at finite temperature and density. Higher-order contributions give more\nnon-local corrections to the effective Euler-Lagrange equation for the chiral field, and the condition for the validity\nof the method is a smooth variation of the chiral field, which should be enough in the analysis of its long-wavelength\nbehavior in the phase transition.\nIncorporating the first inhomogeneity correction in the computation of the effective potential of the linear \u03c3-model\ncoupled to quarks, we found that the latter is significantly modified. Besides a general smoothening of the potential, the\ncritical temperature moves upward and the hight of the barrier separating the symmetric and the broken phase vacua\ndiminishes appreciably. As a direct consequence, the radius of the critical bubble goes down, as well as its free energy,\nand the process of nucleation is facilitated. Although the numbers presented above should be regarded as simple\nestimates, since they rely on a number of approximations, the qualitative behavior is clear. In a detailed quantitative\nanalysis, one should not only integrate numerically the effective potential and relax the thin-wall approximation, but\nalso include the pion-quark interaction in the computation of the fermionic density. We believe that the contribution\nfrom the pion sector will enhance the effect from inhomogeneities.\nIn all the discussion above, we intentionally ignored corrections coming from bosonic fluctuations, which would\nresult in a bosonic determinant correction to the effective potential [31]. To focus on the effect of an inhomogeneous\nbackground field on the fermionic density, we treated the scalar field essentially as a \"heavy\" (classical) field, whereas\nfermions were assumed to be \"light\".\nExperimental signatures of inhomogeneities for high-energy heavy ion collisions were discussed, for instance, in\nRefs. [13, 21]. In particular, inhomogeneities seem to favor an \"explosive\" scenario [16] for the phase conversion even\nat early stages of nucleation. However, one should first incorporate dissipation and noise effects, which tend to retard\nthe explosion [29], before estimating the time scales involved. This analysis will be left for a future publication.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors are grateful to A. Dumitru for a critical reading of the manuscript and several suggestions. We also\nthank D.G.

The contribution coming from \u03c11 is proportional to \u2207i \u2207j \u03c6:\n!\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n\u03b3 0 k0 \u2212 ~\u03b3 * ~k \u2212 M (~x)\n\u03b3 0 k0 \u2212 ~\u03b3 * ~k \u2212 M (~x) 1\n(2)\ni j\n\u03c11 (~x) = \u2212T r\u03b3\n,\n(A1)\n\u2207i \u2207j M (~x0 )x\u0302 x\u0302\nk02 \u2212 Ek2\n2\nk02 \u2212 Ek2\nK\nwhere we use a compact notation for the sum-integrals\nZ\nXZ\n\u2261T\nK\n\nn\n\nd3 k\n(2\u03c0)3\n\n,\n\nK \u2261 (k0 , ~k) = (i\u03c9n \u2212 \u03bcq , ~k), and T r\u03b3 is a trace over Dirac gamma matrices.\nThere is also a contribution proportional to \u2207i \u03c6\u2207j \u03c6 coming from \u03c12 :\n\"\n!#2\nZ\n0\n~k \u2212 M (~x)\n\u03b3\nk\n\u2212\n~\n\u03b3\n*\n\u03b3 0 k0 \u2212 ~\u03b3 * ~k \u2212 M (~x)\n0\n(1)\n\u2207i M (~x)x\u0302i\n\u03c12 (~x) = T r\u03b3\nk02 \u2212 Ek2\nk02 \u2212 Ek2\nK\n\n(A2)\n\n.\n\n(A3)\n\nUp to this order in derivatives, we can write\nZ\nn\no\nd3 k\n2\n~k * \u2207)2 M (~x) [G(Ek , \u03bcq , \u03b2) + G(Ek , \u2212\u03bcq , \u03b2)]\n\u03c11 + \u03c12 = g\n\u03bd\n\u2207\nM\u0302\n(~\nx\n)\n[F\n(E\n,\n\u03bc\n,\n\u03b2)\n+\nF\n(E\n,\n\u2212\u03bc\n,\n\u03b2)]\n+\n(\nq\nk\nq\nk\nq\n(2\u03c0)3\n\n,\n\n\f10\n(A4)\nwhere \u03b2 = 1/T ,\n\u0013 \u0012 2\u03b2(Ek \u2212\u03bcq )\n\u0012\n\u0013\ne\n\u2212 e\u03b2(Ek \u2212\u03bcq )\n1 M2\nF (Ek , \u03bcq , \u03b2) = \u2212\u03b2 \u2212 4 3\n2 Ek\n(e\u03b2(Ek \u2212\u03bcq ) + 1)3\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\ne\u03b2(Ek \u2212\u03bcq )\n3 M\n1\n\u2212 4 4\n\u2212\u03b2\n22 Ek2\n2 EK\n(e\u03b2(Ek \u2212\u03bcq ) + 1)2\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n3 M2\n1\n\u2212\n\u2212\n5\n23 Ek3\n24 EK\n(e\u03b2(Ek \u2212\u03bcq ) + 1)\n2\n\n(A5)\n\nand\ne4\u03b2(Ek \u2212\u03bcq ) \u2212 11e3\u03b2(Ek \u2212\u03bcq ) + 11e2\u03b2(Ek \u2212\u03bcq ) \u2212 e\u03b2(Ek \u2212\u03bcq )\nG(Ek , \u03bcq , \u03b2) = \u2212 \u03b2\n(e\u03b2(Ek \u2212\u03bcq ) + 1)5\n\u0013 \u0012 3\u03b2(Ek \u2212\u03bcq )\n\u0013\n\u0012\n4\n2\ne\n\u2212 4e2\u03b2(Ek \u2212\u03bcq ) + e\u03b2(Ek \u2212\u03bcq )\n5M\n1 M\n+\n\u2212\u03b2 3\n4\n6\n23 EK\n2 EK\n(e\u03b2(Ek \u2212\u03bcq ) + 1)4\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\ne2\u03b2(Ek \u2212\u03bcq ) \u2212 e\u03b2(Ek \u2212\u03bcq )\n3 M2\n45 M 4\n1\n\u2212\u03b2 2 \u2212 3 3 + 2 5 + 2 7\n2 EK\n2 EK\n2 EK\n(e\u03b2(Ek \u2212\u03bcq ) + 1)3\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\ne\u03b2(Ek \u2212\u03bcq )\n5 M2\nM4\n3\n\u2212\u03b2 2 \u2212 4 +\n6 + 35 E 8\n2\n2EK\n2 EK\n(e\u03b2(Ek \u2212\u03bcq ) + 1)2\nK\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0012\n2\n4\n1\n1\n3\n5M\nM\n.\n\u2212 2 \u2212 5 +\n7 + 35 E 9\n2\n2EK\n2 EK\n(e\u03b2(Ek \u2212\u03bcq ) + 1)\nK\n4\n\n\u0012\n\n1 M4\n22 Ek5\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(A6)\n\nRewriting the term proportional to ~k * \u2207 in a more convenient form, using Ek2 = ~k 2 + M 2 , and exploring some\nsymmetries in the integrands, it is straightforward to arrive at the final form:\nZ\ng\u03bdq\ndk ~k 2 [H(Ek , \u03bcq , \u03b2) + H(Ek , \u2212\u03bcq , \u03b2)] ,\n(A7)\n\u03c11 + \u03c12 = \u22072 \u03c6(~x) 2\n2\u03c0\nwhere\n1\nH(Ek , \u03bcq , \u03b2) \u2261 F (Ek , \u03bcq , \u03b2) + ~k 2 G(Ek , \u03bcq , \u03b2) ,\n3\n\n(A8)\n\nwhich gives the correction to the Laplacian.\n\n[1] E.V.
