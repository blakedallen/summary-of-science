This approximation has proven extremely useful for Einstein's equations\nwhere\nGab = 8\u03c0G < Tab >,\n\n(1)\n\nworks well when the matter source is degenerate\nfermionic matter, where <> is a quantum expectation\nvalue, and for thermal radiation, where <> is a thermal average of photons. There are difficulties with this\napproach however, not least that the singularities inherent in fully fledged quantum field theory for the sources\nrender (1) ambiguous and some criterion for cutting off\nthe integrals must be introduced. For example it is well\nknown that a na\u0131\u0308ve calculation of the vacuum energy density of the standard model of particle physics leads to far\ntoo high a value of the cosmological constant to be compatible with observations [1]. Nevertheless (1) seems to\nwork well in the early Universe when the dynamics is\ndominated by radiation, as long as temperatures are well\nbelow the Planck temperature. In the radiation dominated Universe Einstein's equations boil down to the\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) equation, ignoring\nspatial curvature this is\n8\u03c0G\n4\u03c0 3 T 4\n\u02272\n=\n<\nT\n>=\nN\n00\nef\nf\na2\n3\n45 m2P l\n\n(2)\n\nwhere a(t) is the cosmological scale factor and Nef f is the\neffective number of degrees of freedom in the relativistic\ngas,\n7\nNef f := NB + (N+ + N\u2212 )\n8\n\n(3)\n\nwith NB the number of bosonic degrees of freedom (2\nfor photons), and N+ and N\u2212 the number of positive\n\nchirality and negative chirality fermionic degrees of freedom respectively (for a standard model neutrino N+ = 2,\nN\u2212 = 0; for a Dirac fermion N+ = N\u2212 = 2), [2]. The\nPlanck mass, m2P l = G\u22121 (we use units with h\u0304 = c = 1),\nappears in (2) not because we are considering a theory\nof quantum gravity but because of the quantum nature\nof the source for classical gravity.\nIn the Einstein-Cartan formulation of general relativity\nfermionic matter is expected to induce torsion (recent\nbounds on the magnitude of torsion have been derived\nfrom tests of violation of Lorentz invariance [3] and from\ncosmic microwave polarization [4]). When the connection\nis varied in the Einstein-Cartan action the torsion twoforms \u03c4 a = 21 \u03c4 a bc eb \u2227 ec are determined by a spinor field\n\u03a8 via the algebraic equation\n\u03c4 a = 2\u03c0G\u01ebabcd (\u03a8\u03b3 5 \u03b3 d \u03a8)eb \u2227 ec ,\n\n(4)\n\na, b, c, . . . are orthonormal indices (for a review of torsion\nin Einstein-Cartan formulation in general see [5] and [6]).\nIn the spirit of (1) the equation of motion (4) would\nbe interpreted as\n\u03c4a,bc = 4\u03c0G\u01ebabcd < \u03a8\u03b3 5 \u03b3 d \u03a8 >= \u22124\u03c0G\u01ebabcd < j5d >,\n(5)\nwhere j5a = \u03a8\u03b3 a \u03b3 5 \u03a8 is the axial current. As is well known\nfermions generate torsion in the anti-symmetric class of\ntensors, according to the classification of [7].\nWe shall examine the effect of torsion arising from relativistic fermions in the early Universe, assuming isotropy\nand spatial homogeneity of both the geometry and the\nmatter. It will be assumed that the metric of RobertsonWalker type and that the energy-momentum is of the\nform\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c1 0\n(6)\nTab =\n0 P \u03b4ij\nwhere the density \u03c1 and pressure P are homogeneous\n\n\f2\nand depend only on time and i, j = 1, 2, 3 are space-like\nindices.\nThe Riemann tensor involves the square of the connection and the net effect of including the torsion (4) into\nthe gravitational connection is that Einstein's equations\nare modified to\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\n\u0227\n\u03c42\n3\n= 8\u03c0G\u03c1\n(7)\n\u2212\na2\n4\n\u03c42\n2\u00e4 \u02272\n= 8\u03c0GP,\n(8)\n\u2212 \u2212 2+\na\na\n4\nwhere a(t) is the Robertson-Walker scale factor and\n\u03c4 2 = \u2212\u03c4 a \u03c4a = \u221216\u03c0 2 G2 (\u03a8\u03b3 5 \u03b3 a \u03a8)(\u03a8\u03b3 5 \u03b3a \u03a8)\n\n(9)\n\n(the metric signature is (\u2212, +, +, +), the Clifford algebra\nconvention is {\u03b3 a , \u03b3 b } = \u22122\u03b7 ab , with \u03b3 0 hermitian, and\nspatial curavature is taken to be zero). Equations (7)\nand (8) are not independent and are related by the (first)\nBianchi identity which is analysed below. Eliminating \u03c4\ngives the usual relation between the acceleration and the\ndensity and pressure,\n\nwhile\n< j50 >= (n+ \u2212 n+ ) \u2212 (n\u2212 \u2212 n\u2212 )\n\n(15)\n\nwhere n+ , n+ , n\u2212 and n\u2212 are thermal averages of the\nnumber densities of positive chirality particles, positive\nchirality anti-particles, negative chirality particles and\nnegative chirality anti-particles respectively. In contrast\nthe vector current j a = \u03a8\u03b3 a \u03a8) has\n< j 0 >= (n+ \u2212 n+ ) + (n\u2212 \u2212 n\u2212 ) = n \u2212 n,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere n = n+ + n\u2212 is the number density of all particles\nand n = n+ + n\u2212 the number density of anti-particles.\nThe integral of j 0 over a co-moving 3-dimensional volume\nV gives the total number of fermions in that volume,\ncounting anti-particles as negative,\nZ\n(17)\nj 0 a3 (t)d3 x = N \u2212 N ,\nV\n\nR\n\n(10)\n\nwhere N = V na3 (t)d3 x, etc. The corresponding number for the axial current,\nZ\nj50 a3 (t)d3 x = N+ \u2212 N\u2212 \u2212 (N + \u2212 N \u2212) := NA (18)\n\nSince fermions constitute quantum matter, it seems\nnatural to interpret (4) in the early Universe as meaning\na thermal average (5). However there is an ambiguity as\nto whether (9) should be interpreted using\n\nwe shall call the axial particle number in the volume V .\nIn the abscence of chemical potentials, for a thermal\ndistribution with the temperature much greater than any\nparticle masses,\n\n\u00e4\n4\u03c0G\n=\u2212\n(\u03c1 + 3P ).\na\n3\n\n< (\u03a8\u03b3 5 \u03b3 a \u03a8)(\u03a8\u03b3 5 \u03b3a \u03a8) >=< j5a j5,a >\n\n(11)\n\nor\n< \u03a8\u03b3 5 \u03b3 a \u03a8 >< \u03a8\u03b3 5 \u03b3a \u03a8 >=< j5a >< j5,a >\n\n(12)\n\nThese are different in general. The former can be Fierz\nre-arranged to give\n< (\u03a8\u03b3 5 \u03b3 a \u03a8)(\u03a8\u03b3 5 \u03b3a \u03a8) > =\n4 < (\u03a8\u2020+\u03a8\u2212 )(\u03a8\u2020\u2212 \u03a8+ ) >\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u03a8+ and \u03a8\u2212 are the positive and negative chirality components of \u03a8. In a first quantised theory this is\npositive definite for Dirac spinors and vanishes for Weyl\nspinors [5], hence \u03c4 2 < 0 in (9), making the torsion spacelike (in the classification of [7] this is denoted As). The\ncosmological consequences of this formulation in inflationary models are explored in [8]. The same philosophy,\napplied to spin densities rather than the pseudo-vector\n\u03a8\u03b3 5 \u03b3 a \u03a8, is followed in [9] and [10].\nWe reach a radically different conclusion if we use (12),\nwhich follows from taking the thermal average of (4) before calculating the Riemann tensor. Applying the usual\nRobertson-Walker assumptions of spatial homogeneity\nand isotropy to the connection, and hence the torsion,\nwe would conclude that, in the cosmic frame,\n< j5i >= 0,\n\n(14)\n\nV\n\nn\u00b1 = n\u00b1 =\n\n3 \u03b6(3) 3\nT\n4 \u03c02\n\n(19)\n\nso N = N and the torsion vanishes. A non-zero chemical potential is necessary for any asymmetry between\nparticle and anti-particle numbers. We see here that a\nchemical potential can also generate torsion, since then\n\u0010 \u03bc \u00112\n1\n\u00b1\nn \u00b1 \u2212 n \u00b1 = \u03bc\u00b1 T 2 + o\nT3\n(20)\n6\nT\nfor \u03bc\u00b1 << T , where \u03bc+ and \u03bc\u2212 are chemical potentials\nfor positive and negative chirality particles, see e.g. [2].\nIn a chiral theory, such as the Standard Model, \u03bc+ and\n\u03bc\u2212 can be different in general and\n< j50 >=\n\n1\n(\u03bc+ \u2212 \u03bc\u2212 )T 2 ,\n6\n\n(21)\n\n\u00012\nIn a\nwhere we have ignored terms o \u03bcT\u00b1 .\nRobertson-Walker Universe undergoing adiabatic expansion, a \u221d 1/T , the thermal average of the axial current\n\u2207a < j5a >= 0 is conserved, and hence NA is constant,\nif and only if (\u03bc+ \u2212 \u03bc\u2212 ) \u221d T is linear in T . The total fermion number, N \u2212 N , is constant if and only if\n(\u03bc+ + \u03bc\u2212 ) \u221d T (particle masses are being ignored here).\nTo summarise, in general equations (5) and (12) give\n\u03c42 =\n\n4\u03c0 2 G2\n(\u03bc+ \u2212 \u03bc\u2212 )2 T 4\n9\n\n(22)\n\n\f3\nwhich is positive in any chiral model for matter with\n\u03bc+ 6= \u03bc\u2212 . For a model with Nf different types of\nfermion each fermions species can have different chem(k)\nical potentials \u03bc\u00b1 , where we label the species with an\ninteger k, and then \u03bc\u00b1 is always understood below to\nPNf (k)\nmean \u03bc\u00b1 = k=1\n\u03bc\u00b1 . Since positive and negative chirality particles in a chiral model can have different weak\n(k)\n(k)\ncharges one expects that \u03bc+ 6= \u03bc\u2212 in general, and the\ntorsion can be non-zero, at least for the era before the\nelectro-weak phase transition, [11].\nDefine\n\u03c4=\n\n2\u03c0G\n(\u03bc+ \u2212 \u03bc\u2212 )T 2 ,\n3\n\n(23)\n\nin terms of which the non-vanishing components of the\ntorsion are\n\u03c4i,jk = \u01ebijk \u03c4,\n\n(24)\n\n(in the classification of [7] this is time-like, At). Rotational invariance of the thermal average is not incompatible with the conclusion of [12], where classical solutions\nof the Weyl equation were analyzed in spherical symmetric space-times with torsion - thermal averages do\nnot necessarily have the same symmetries as solutions of\nthe equations of motion. The general form of the torsion\ncompatible with Robertson-Walker symmetries was given\nin [13]. The fact that chiral fermions can have interesting consequences when torsion is taken into consideration\nwas noted in the context of anomalies for lepton currents\nin the Standard Model of particle physics in [14].\nBoth (11) and (12) have interesting, though very different, cosmological consequences. The form (12), being the\nsquare of a vector, has a dual description as the square of\na 3-form and as such is in the class of models described in\n[15]. Indeed a term of this form is present in the LandauGinsparg models discussed in [15], though the stabilising\nquartic term is absent and there is no kinetic term here.\nA kinetic term would require time derivatives of the torsion and so would go beyond Einstein-Cartan theory -\nsuch terms would be expected to appear in an effective\naction description of gravity involving higher derivatives\nand powers of the Riemann tensor.\nSo which should one use (11) or (12)? Weinberg [16]\ntakes the point of view that there is nothing special about\ntorsion: it is just another tensor and one can always move\nit to the right hand side of Einstein's equations and consider it to be part of the matter rather than part of the\ngeometry. We see here that, in the context of (1), there\nis an ambiguity. If the torsion terms are absorbed into\nthe energy momentum tensor before expectation values\nare taken then it would seem that (11) is appropriate.\nIn the Einstein-Cartan formulation however the torsion\nis determined by the equation of motion (4), in which\nthe square of the torsion does not appear. If the gravitational field itself is not quantised, it is hard to see any\n\ninterpretation of the equation of motion (4) other than\n(5). When the Riemann tensor is calculated it is then\n(12) that arises and not (11). Much of the literature has\nfocused on (11), in a cosmological context for example\n(11) was used in [8]. In this paper the consequences of\n(5) and (12) will be explored and developed.\nWe shall see that, in the context of the early Universe,\nthe torsion can give a negative contribution to the energy density. The mechanism here is different to torsion\ninduced avoidance of the initial singularity due to spin\nfluids considered previously, [17\u201321], in which the spin\ndensity necessarily breaks either rotational or translation\ninvariance.\nWhen there is torsion the Bianchi identity does not\nrequire that Gab be co-variantly constant, in general one\nhas\n1 eadbc\n\u03c4d,bc ,\n(25)\n\u2207b Gba = \u2212\u03c4 c bc Gba + R\n2\neadbc := 1 \u01ebada\u2032 d\u2032 Ra\u2032 d\u2032 b\u2032 c\u2032 \u01ebbcb\u2032 c\u2032 . In the case of\nwhere R\n4\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) Universes under\nstudy here only the second term on the right hand side\ncontributes giving\n\u2207b Gb0 = \u2212\n\n3\u03c4 d\n(\u03c4 a),\n2 a dt\n\n\u2207b Gbi = 0.\n\n(26)\n\nOne strategy is to demand \u2207b Gba = 0 and use this to\ndetermine the torsion, implying that \u03c4 \u221d 1/a [22], but\nthis is too restrictive for our purposes. Instead we take\nthermodynamic averages as above and use (23) for the\nform of the torsion.\nAssuming adiabatic expansion T \u221d 1/a, [2], a can be\neliminated from Einstein's equations in favour of T to\ngive\n8\u03c0G\n\u03c0 2 G2\n\u1e6a 2\n=\n\u03c1\n+\n(\u03bc+ \u2212 \u03bc\u2212 )2 T 4 ,\n(27)\nT2\n3\n9\n4\u03c0G\n2\u03c0 2 G2\nT\u0308\n=\n(5\u03c1 + 3P ) +\n(\u03bc+ \u2212 \u03bc\u2212 )2 T 4 . (28)\nT\n3\n9\nThese two equations are not independent, the Bianchi\nidentity (26) gives an equation relating \u03c1, P , T and \u03bc\u00b1 .\nExpressing time derivatives as temperature derivatives,\nd\nd\ndt = \u1e6a dT , differentiating (27) and using (28) to eliminate\nT\u0308 gives\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd\u03c1\n24\nd \b\n3h \u2212 T\n,\n(29)\n(\u03bc+ \u2212 \u03bc\u2212 )2 T 2 =\nT3\ndT\n\u03c0G\ndT\nwhere h = \u03c1 + P is the enthalpy density. For standard\nequations of state (relativistic gas, dust, cosmological\nconstant) the right hand side of (29) vanishes, so the torsion described here necessarily requires a modification of\nthe equation of state. Let \u03c1 = \u03c10 +\u2206\u03c1, P = P0 +\u2206P and\nh = h0 + \u2206h, where \u03c10 etc., satisfy a standard equation\nof state.

We make the co-variant decomposition of the Einstein tensor\n0\n\nGab = Gab + \u2206Gab\n\n(32)\n\n(35)\n\n0\n\nwhere the T 4 term is assumed to have the usual\nform for massless particles with Nef f degrees of\nfreedom. In particular the torsion necessarily gives\na negative contribution to the energy density in this\ncase, though in realistic models this is a small effect. We must take b << 1 to be consistent with\nour assumption that (\u03bc+ \u2212\u03bc\u2212 ) << T . This is compatible with the observed value of the current ratio\nof Baryon to photon densities\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03bc+ + \u03bc\u2212\n\u03c02\nn\u2212n\n\u2248 10\u22129 ,\n(33)\n=\nn\u03b3\n12\u03b6(3)\nT\n3\nwith n\u03b3 = 2\u03b6(3)\n\u03c0 2 T . Unless \u03bc+ and \u03bc\u2212 have opposite sign and the smallness of this number is due to\na delicate cancellation between two large numbers,\nthis requires b to be of the order of, or less than,\n10\u22129 at the present time. Then the ratio of the two\n\u0010\n\u00112\n2\nterms in (32) is of order Nbef f mTP l which is very\n\nsmall for T << mP l (obviously the analysis here is\nonly valid for T << mP l where quantum gravity\neffects are assumed to be very small).\nThis behaviour \u03c4 \u223c 1/a3 for torsion arising from\nspin in the early Universe has been studied before,\n[20, 21].\n\n\u2022 For any period during which \u03bc+ \u2212 \u03bc\u2212 is constant,\nindependent of temperature, equation (30) gives a\nlogarithmic correction to the the energy density,\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u03c02\n\u03c0G\nT\n4\n2 4\n\u03c1\u2248\n, (34)\nNef f T \u2212\n(\u03bc+ \u2212 \u03bc\u2212 ) T ln\n30\n12\nT0\nwhere T0 is an arbitrary constant that can be absorbed into the definition of Nef f . Axial particle\nnumber is not conserved in this case and one expects Baryon/Lepton number violating processes\nunless \u03bc+ = \u2212\u03bc\u2212 .\nOf course the generation of Baryon or Lepton number\nrequires P and CP violation as well as a period out of\nthermal equilibrium, according to the Sakharov conditions, [25]. The details would depend on the particular\n\nwhere Gab is the Einstein tensor constructed from the\ntorsion-free connection.

Expanding \u2206\u03c9 a b =\n\u2206\u03c9 a b,c ec the components \u2206\u03c9 a b,c , being the difference\nof two connections, constitute a tensor field so (36) is\n0\n\nagain a co-variant decomposition. Gab is the zero torsion\nEinstein tensor for which the first Bianchi identity implies\n0\n\n0\n\n\u2207b G\n\nba\n\n=0\n\n0\n\n(37)\n0\n\nwhere \u2207b is the co-variant derivative using \u03c9 a b .

In fact both terms in (43) are\nseparately conserved with the torsion-free connection.\nFinally we observe that the geometrical significance\nof non-zero \u03c4 follows from the anti-symmetrised action\nof two co-variant derivatives on an arbitrary vector field\nwith components U a ,\n[\u2207a , \u2207b ]U c = \u2212\u03c4 d ab \u2207d U c + Rc dab U d .\n\n(44)\n\nIn addition to the algebraic (rotation) term involving the\nRiemmann tensor there is a derivative term involving the\ntorsion - a deficit displacement implying that parallelograms generated by parallel transport do not close. The\ndeficit displacement in Robertson-Walker space-time described here is compatible with 3-dimensional rotational\nsymmetry - a vector field with Robertson-Walker symmetries must have U i = 0 in which case\n[\u2207i , \u2207j ]U 0 = \u2212\u03c4 \u01ebij k \u2207k U 0\n\n(45)\n\nand this vanishes if U 0 independent of position. For any\nfield compatible with the Robertson-Walker symmetries\nspace-like parallelograms close with the torsion studied\nhere. However they need not close for fields that do not\nshare the symmetries of the background metric.\nThe author wishes to thank the Perimeter Institute,\nWaterloo, Canada, and the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies for financial support.\n\n\u2217\nElectronic address: bdolan@thphys.nuim.ie\n[1] S.
