INTRODUCTION\nALICE is a general-purpose heavy-ion experiment designed to study the physics of strongly\ninteracting matter and the quark-gluon plasma in nucleus-nucleus collisions at the LHC. The\nALICE detector [1] is designed to deal with large particle multiplicities, dN/dy up to 8000, well\nabove the multiplicities expected for PbPb collisions at LHC energies.\nThe ALICE collaboration will also study collisions of lower-mass ions and protons. The pp\ncollisions will primarily provide reference data for the nucleus-nucleus collisions but in addition\na number of genuine pp physics studies will be done.\n\u03c0/K\nTPC + ITS\n(dE/dx) K/p\ne/\u03c0\n\nTOF\n\n\u03c0/K\nK/p\ne/\u03c0\n\u03c0/K\n\nHMPID\n(RHICH)\n\nK/p\n\nTRD\n\ne/\u03c0\n\nPHOS\n\n\u03b3/\u03c00\n\nMUON\n\nmu/\u03c0\n10\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\np (GeV/c)\n\n100\n\nFigure 1: ALICE Pseudo rapidity coverage of the ALICE detectors (left panel), and the particle identification capabilities\nof the detectors right panel).\n\nThe main components of the ALICE detector are a central tracking and particle identification\nsystem covering the pseudo rapidity range \u22120.9 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 0.9, a muon spectrometer covering\n\u22124.0 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 \u22122.4, a forward multiplicity detector and a zero-degree calorimeter. An overview of\nthe \u03b7 coverage of the ALICE systems is shown in the left panel of Figure 1.\nThe transverse momentum cut-off is only 0.1 GeV/c due to the extreme minimisation of the\nmaterial budget of the inner tracking system. On the other hand the pt measurement reaches up\nto 50 GeV/c with full particle identification capabilities at mid-rapidity.\nPreprint submitted to Nuclear Physics A\n\nNovember 9, 2018\n\n\fThe central part is embedded in the large L3 solenoidal magnet which provides a field of\n0.5 T. The tracking system is subdivided in the inner tracking system (ITS) using different kinds\nof silicon detectors and a large time projection chamber (TPC). The inner tracking system consists of six concentric cylindrical layers of detectors. From inside out the inner tracking system\nconsists of two layers of silicon pixel detectors, two layers of silicon drift detectors and two layers of silicon strip detectors. The TPC consists of two 2.5 m long drift volumes separated by a\ncentral cathode. The inner tracking system determines the vertex resolution of the system while\nthe TPC essentially defines the momentum resolution.\nThe transition radiation detector and the time of flight (TOF) array cover the full azimuthal\nangle. Additional detectors with partial coverage of the central barrel are the photon spectrometer, the high momentum particle identification detector and the electromagnetic calorimeter. An\noverview of the ALICE particle identification capabilities is shown in the right panel of Figure 1.\nDetails of the detector design and the expected performance are described in [1].\nRead-out of the muon spectrometer is triggered by the muon trigger chambers. The central\ntracking system is triggered by a combination of dedicated trigger detectors (T0, V0) and a trigger\nderived from the silicon pixel detectors (SPD) in the innermost layer of the tracking system. Each\nchip in the SPD front-end system outputs a \"fast-or\" signal indicating that at least one pixel has\nfired. These signals are combined in a global multiplicity trigger which can be adjusted to select\ncentral events in PbPb collisions. However, since the noise in pixel detectors is intrinsically low,\nthe same system was used to trigger on single cosmic muons for commissioning purposes.\nThe hardware triggering system is complemented by the high level trigger (HLT) system\nwhich uses a large processor farm to select or tag events after read-out of the hardware. About\n30% of this system was installed during the detector commissionng phase. In addition to its event\nselection capabilities this system provides a data quality monitoring facility.\nThe experiment is ready for data taking with both proton and heavy-ion beams. Partially installed are TRD (25%, completed 2010), PHOS (60%, completed 2010) and EMCAL (completed\n2011). The central tracking system, the time of flight system and the forward muon spectrometer are fully installed. Also the data acquisition system (DAQ) and the detector control system\n(DCS) are fully installed. Therefore at start-up ALICE has full hadron and muon identification\ncapabilities and partial photon and electron identification capabilities.\n2. COMMISSIONING\nAll installed detectors have been tested concurrently for noise performance in the L3 magnetic field. Cabling, grounding and power supply issues have been resolved. During 2007/2008\nthree cosmic data taking periods with runs involving all detectors 24 hours a day were taken.\nThe first run of 12 days in December 2007 was mainly used to debug the global and detector\nspecific data taking systems. The second run of five weeks (February-March 2008) was used to\nverify that all systems could efficiently operate without mutual interference. The majority of the\ncommissioning data was collected in the third run which started in May 2008 and lasted until\nthe foreseen start-up of the LHC in October. Using the silicon pixel trigger, adjusted to trigger\non single particles, a sample of muons crossing the entire tracking system has been collected in\n2008. In addition the dedicated cosmic trigger system (ACORDE) was used to collect a large\nsample of single and multiple cosmic muon events. The muon spectrometer was triggered using\nits own muon trigger system. The total read-out rate was about 100 Hz during several months,\nthus testing both the data acquisition system and the offline reconstruction software thoroughly.\nThe availability of real data from the detectors has stimulated the implementation of additional\n2\n\n\fGB\n\ncumulated data size\n\n2500\n\n2000\n\n1500\n\n1000\n\n500\n\n0\n07/09\n\n07/11\n\n08/01\n\n08/03\n\n08/05\n\n08/07\n\n08/08\n\n08/10\n\n08/12\nDate\n\nFigure 2: Left panel: Online source code size as a function of time in 2008. The code has grown by about 15% with\na large increase in the activity near the end of the datataking period. Right panel: Amount of data accumulated by the\nDAQ system.\n\nfeatures in the online software, as illustrated in Figure 2. The code has grown by about 15%\nwith a large increase in the activity near the end of the datataking period. In addition valuable\nexperience in operating all systems was gained allowing for efficient datataking when the LHC\nstarts delivering beams. In 515 days of datataking a total of about 3 PB of data was read-out of\nwhich 350 TB was recorded to tape, see Figure 2.\nThe muon spectrometer has collected a small sample of nearly horizontally moving cosmic\nmuons which allowed to check the trigger system and gave a first indication of the internal alignment of the chambers. The cosmic data provided an opportunity to align the central tracking\nsystems and partially calibrate them. For the smaller detectors beams will be needed to calibrate and align because they are in an unfavourable orientation with respect to cosmic muons or\nbecause their area is too small to collect a useful sample in an acceptable time. The following\nparagraphs describe the results obtained for the central tracking systems. For further details on\nthe ITS commissioning results see also [2].\nIn case of a single muon crossing the inner layers of the tracking system the reconstruction\nsoftware finds two tracks because it searches for tracks coming from the interaction region. The\ndistance between the two tracks provides a measure of the vertex resolution. The result before\nand after alignment of the individual layers of the inner tracking system is show in Figure 3\n(upper left panel). The vertex resolution depends mostly on the alignment of the inner (pixel)\nlayers. The estimated vertex resolution is 40 \u03bcm, close to the design value.\nThe silicon drift detectors measure the r\u03c6 coordinate by measuring the arrival time of the\nelectrons on the anodes. However, the drift speed depends strongly on the temperature. Therefore the ALICE silicon drift detectors have integrated electron injection devices which allow to\nmonitor the drift speed continuously. During the cosmic run the drift speed was measured as a\nfunction of the position on the detectors and of time. Figure 3 shows the result of the drift speed\ndistribution on a detector (upper middle panel) and the speed as a function of time (upper right\npanel). The drift speed is stable during many hours of operation as a consequence of the stable\nthermal conditions in the inner tracking system. This allows an effective reconstruction of the\nposition using the measured drift speed map. In addition the drift detectors were aligned and the\ndE/dx measurement was calibrated.\nThe outer two layers of the ITS, consisting of silicon strip detectors were aligned using the\ncosmic muon tracks. In addition to the position measurements these detectors provide a dE/dx\n3\n\n\fw/o alignment\nwith alignment\n\n200\n150\n100\n\nLayer 3 Ladder 2 Det 3 Side 0\n250\n300\n200\n\n250\n200\n\n150\n\n150\n100\n100\n\n50\n0\n\n50\n\n-300\n\n-200\n\n-100\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n100\n200\n300\ntrack-to-extra-cluster \u2206xy [\u03bcm]\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n250\n\n6.85\n\nLayer 3 Ladder 1 Det 4\n\nAnode 16\nAnode 128\n\n6.8\n\nAnode 240\n\n6.75\n\n6.7\n6.65\n\n50\n\n6.6\n\n0\n\n6.55\n0\n\nTime bin\n\nCharge - Layer 6\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100 120 140 160 180 200 220\n\nEvent number\n\nCharge correlation - Layer 6\n\n400\n\nq [keV]\n\n350\n\n600\n\n100\n\nN\n\nEntries\n\n200\n\nDrift Speed (\u03bcm/ns)\n\nEntrieshoverlaps 1935\nEntries\n1935\nMean\n-1.161\nMean\n-1.231\nRMS\n36.93\nRMS\n36.86\n\u03c722 / ndf\n137.9 / 60\n\u03c7 / ndf\n137.9 / 60\nProb\n4.548e-08\nProb\n4.548e-08\nConstant\n242\nConstant\n242 \u00b1\u00b1 7.8\n7.8\nMean\n-1.398\nMean\n-1.398 \u00b1\u00b1 0.468\n0.468\nSigma\nSigma\n19.56\n19.56 \u00b1\u00b1 0.43\n\nALICE preliminary\n\nAnode\n\n250\n\n500\n80\n\n300\n400\n250\n\n60\n300\n\n200\n\n40\n\n150\n\n200\n\n100\n20\n\n100\n50\n0\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n0\n0\n\n500\n600\nq [keV]\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n600\nq [keV]\n\n0\n\nP\n\nFigure 3: Calibration and alignment results for the inner tracking system. Upper left: track to track distance before\nand after alignment. Upper middle panel: drift speed map of a silicon drift detector. Upper right panel: Drift speed as\na function of time for a silicon drift detector. Lower left panel: measured energy loss in a silicon strip detector after\ncalibration. Lower right panel: Measured charge correlation between the two sides of a silicon strip detector\n\nmeasurement. An example of the response is shown in Figure 3 (lower left panel) demonstrating\nthat a signal to noise ratio of about 40 is achieved. Because the silicon strip detectors in ALICE\nare double sided they provide both the r\u03c6 and z coordinates in a single detector. However, although the stereo angle between the strips on each side is relatively small, ambiguities may arise\nif two particle cross the detector close to each other. A significant fraction of these ambiguities\ncan be resolved because the charge measured on both sides of the detector is the same apart from\nthe noise in the respective channels. An example of the correlation of the charge measurements\non both sides of the same detector is show in Figure 3 (lower right panel).\nThe time projection chamber has an integrated laser calibration system in order to measure\nthe drift speed. Figure 4, upper left panel, shows the measurement of the ionisation trails of the\nlaser beams. In order to calibrate the dE/dx measurement in the TPC a radioactive gas was injected in the drift volume. The measured energy spectrum of the Kr decays, see the upper middle\npanel of Figure 4, shows the excellent energy resolution of the TPC. Due to electron attachment\nand diffusion the measured charge depends on the position of the ionisation in the drift volume.\nThe upper right panel of Figure 4 shows the amplitude as a function of the position. Both the\ndE/dx measurement and the drift speed must be corrected for the gas pressure and temperature\nwhich are also continuously monitored. The extensive commissioning period provided ample\ndata to verify all necessary corrections.\nDue to its large volume the TPC could collect more than 10M cosmic muon and particle\nshower events. This large sample allowed to test the particle identification capabilities of the\nTPC as shown in Figure 4 lower left panel. A clear separation of electrons, muons and protons is\ndemonstrated at momenta up to 3 GeV/c. The dE/dx resolution, without a thorough calibration,\nis already 5.7%, very close to the design value of 5.5%.\nThe momentum resolution was studied by separating the cosmic tracks into two halves and\n4\n\n\fmean cluster charge (ADC cts.)\n\ny/mm\n\n\u00d7103\n2000\n140\n1000\n\n120\n100\n\n0\n80\n-1000\n\n60\n40\n\n70\n60\n\nEntries\np0\n\n6990380\n68.17 \u00b1 0.02\n\n50\np1\n\n1.213e\u221206\u00b1 6.923e\u221209\n\n40\n30\n20\n\n-2000\n20\n-2000\n\n-1000\n\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n0\n0\n\nTPC dE/dx signal (a.u.)\n\nx/mm\n\n10\n\n500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000\n\nKr cluster charge [ADC channels]\n\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n200\n250\nz position of cluster (cm)\n\n3\n\n10\n\n\u03bc\n\np\n\nd\n\ne\n102\n\n10-1\n\n1\n\n10\n\nmomentum p (GeV)\n\nFigure 4: ALICE particle identification in the TPC from cosmic shower events\n\ncomparing the reconstructed momenta. Already after the first attempt to align and calibrate a\nmomentum resolution of 6% at 10 GeV/c is achieved, reassuringly close to the design value of\n4.5% [3].\nFor the time of flight (TOF) system a special purpose cosmic trigger, using the signals from\nthe TOF system itself, was developed to collect a sample of cosmic muon events crossing two\nof the TOF modules. The time projection chamber was used to measure the momentum of the\nmuon and the track length between the two TOF modules. Since all muons measured this way are\nrelativistic the time difference between the two modules measured by the TOF can be compared\nto the time difference calculated from the track length. The\n\u221a time resolution of a single module is\nthen found by dividing the width of the distribution by 2. Thus the time resolution of the TOF\nsystem, even with the current preliminary calibration, was found to be 130 ps, see also Figure 5,\nshowing that also the TOF performs close to its design specifications.\nThe high momentum particle identification system (HMPID), the transition radiation detector\n(TRD) and the photon spectrometer (PHOS) are placed in unfavourable positions for detecting\ncosmic muons. Nevertheless small samples of data were collected with which the proper functioning of the detectors could be verified. Figure 6, left panel, shows the measurement of the\ntrack matching precision between the TPC and the HMPID without a precise alignment [4]. The\nright panel of the same figure shows the first observed TRD signals [5]. The PHOS system is\nnot yet completed but one module was operated at room temperature, instead of -20\u25e6 as foreseen\nin the design. Nevertheless even at room temperature an energy resolution of dE/E of 0.24 was\nobtained, see Figure 6 centre panel.\nIn August and September 2008 the first protons were injected into the LHC. While the particles extracted from the SPS were dumped at the end of the extraction line or at a collimator in the\nLHC the relative timing of the ALICE trigger detectors could be studied.

Right panel:\nThe completion of the pretrigger system, realized in\nFirst TRD signals.\nsummer 2008, allowed for a readout of the complete detector signal and enabled for the first time the track reconstruction in real operation. The signal as a function of time\naveraged over all detectors is shown in Fig. 6. During the\ncosmic-ray data taking in ALICE in the fall of 2008 a total\nof about 50k tracks were recorded in the TRD. This was\nmade possible due to the successful operation of the TRD\nLevel 1 trigger, allowing a fast and efficient track decision\nat the GTU level.\nThe tracking and PID algorithms of the TRD rely on\nthe knowledge of several calibration constants depending\non temperature and pressure, the gas composition and the\nchamber geometry. These are the drift velocity of the electrons, the time-offset of the signal, the gas gain and the\nwidth of the Pad Response Function. They will be calibrated using the raw signal of the detector or the signal\nfrom reconstructed tracks in\nand Pb+Pb collisions.\nDuring the data taking, a first calibration is performed on\nthe online systems, the Data Acquisition (DAQ) and High\nLevel Trigger (HLT). The software was tested on DAQ with\nso-called \"black events\" and with cosmic-ray events taken\nin the ALICE setup. With the assumption that the cosmic rays are uniformly distributed over the detector, a gas\ngain variation of about 16 was found over the chambers.\nFig. 7 shows the gain factors as function of the detector\nnumber for the four supermodules operated in ALICE in\n2008.\n\nare sufficiently small to allow equalisation in the central trigger processor so that the individual\ntriggers can be combined into coincident trigger conditions. The particle showers emitted from\nthe dump at the end of the extraction line provided excellent test signals to compare the particle\ndensities measured by the forward multiplicity detector (FMD), the silicon pixel detectors, the\nV0 trigger counters and the muon spectrometer.\nWhen the first particles were sent through the ALICE experiment into the next section of\nthe LHC the first beam interaction was observed in the central tracking system. Figure 7 shows\nthe reconstructed event containing an interaction between a stray particle from the beam and a\nsilicon pixel detector in the innermost layer of the inner tracking system.\n3. Prospects for early physics\n\n0\n\n1.6\n\nThe LHC accelerator is expected to resume operations in 2009. At start-up some pp collisions\nat 900 GeVwill be provided, followed by a pp run at the highest possible LHC energy. PbPb\ncollisions are expected in 2010.\nThe ALICE detector was optimized for the high multiplicity environment resulting from\nheavy ion collisions, see Section 1. This also gives it unique capabilities for the measurement of\nproton-proton collisions.\n6\n\nThe drift velocity and time offset are d\nthe average signal as function of time show\nresults obtained online were consistent with\noffline after the tracking in a second pass c\nextracted drift velocity values had a variati\nthe chambers.\n\nFigure 8: Screenshot of the DCS system\nexample shows the status of the front-end e\n30 chambers within one TRD supermodule\n\nThe running of a complex system as th\ntated by an efficient and user-friendly dete\ntem (DCS) which ensures safe and stabl\nmonitoring of the detector.

During the following high energy pp run ALICE will\ncollect a large sample of minimum bias events providing the multiplicity and pt -distributions as\nwell as important reference data for the heavy-ion programme. In addition, the unique capabilities of ALICE will allow it to contribute significantly to the measurement of the baryon transport\nmechanism. The measurement of the charm cross section will provide important input to the pp\nQCD physics.\nThe first 105 PbPb events, collected in less than 1 day, will provide global event properties\nsuch as the multiplicity distribution, the rapidity density and elliptic flow. The source characteristics (particle spectra, resonances, differential flow and interferometry) can be extracted from\nthe first 106 events (1 week). In the first year of PbPb collisions ALICE will collect 107 minimum bias events and an equal number of central collisions (5% most central), allowing the study\nof charmonium production, jet quenching and heavy-flavour energy loss in the medium. These\nmeasurements will provide information on the bulk properties of the medium, such as the energy\ndensity, temperature, pressure, heat capacity/entropy, viscosity, speed of sound and opacity.\nFor a detailed description of the ALICE physics capabilities see [6, 7, 8, 9].\n4. Summary\nAll installed detector systems were debugged and commissioned during 2008. Partially installed are the TRD (25%, to be completed in 2010), the PHOS (60%, to be cpompleted in 2010)\nand the EMCAL (to be completed in 2011). All other systems are fully installed. The central\ntracking systems have been tested and calibrated using cosmic muons. The performance is shown\nto be close to the design values for the silicon detectors, the time projection chamber and the time\nof flight system. The data acquisition system and the offline software have been tested with more\nthan 350 TB of data from cosmic ray events.\nThe ALICE experiment is ready to take data with pp and PbPb collisions to be provided by\nthe LHC accelerator.\nReferences\n[1] F.
