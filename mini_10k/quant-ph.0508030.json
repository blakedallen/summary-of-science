Here we show an\neavesdropping scheme, by which the eavesdropper can\nachieve the full information of the key with a probability\nof unity and will not be discovered by the the legitimate\nusers, even in the case that they have the perfect singlephoton source and the loseless channel.\nThere are two protocols in Ref. [1]. Consider their first\nprotocol:\nProtocol 1:\n(a1) Alice(the sender) prepares a linear polarized qubit\nin its initial state |\u03c8i0 = |0i, where |0i and |1i represent\ntwo orthogonal polarizations of the qubit, and chooses a\nrandom angle \u03b8.\n(a2) Alice rotates the polarization of the qubit by \u03b8,\nto bring the state of the qubit to |\u03c8i1 = \u00dby (\u03b8)|\u03c8i0 =\ncos \u03b8|0i \u2212 sin \u03b8|1i, and then sends the qubit to Bob(the\nreceiver).\n(a3) Bob chooses another random angle and rotates\nthe polarization of the received qubit by \u03c6; |\u03c8i2 =\n\u00dby (\u03c6)|\u03c8i1 = cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6)|0i \u2212 sin(\u03b8 + \u03c6)|1i, Bob sends the\nqubit back to Alice.\n(a4) Alice rotates the polarization angle of the qubit by\n\u2212\u03b8 and then encodes the message by further rotating the\npolarization angle of \u00b1 \u03c04 ; |\u03c8i3 = \u00dby (\u00b1 \u03c04 ) \u00d7 \u00dby (\u2212\u03b8)|\u03c8i2 ,\nAlice send the qubit to Bob. (Alice and Bob have predetermined that + \u03c04 is say, \"0\" and \u2212 \u03c04 is \"1\".\n(a5) Bob measure the polarization after rotating the\npolarization by \u2212\u03c6; |\u03c8i4 = \u00dby (\u2212\u03c6)|\u03c8i3 = \u00dby (\u00b1 \u03c04 )|\u03c8i0 ,\n\u00dby (+ \u03c04 ) and \u00dby (\u2212 \u03c04 ) are orthogonal to each other, which\nenables Bob to read the keys precisely.\nOur attacking scheme works as following:\n(a1\u2032 ) After step (a2) in the above protocol, Eve intercepts all qubits from Alice and stores them. (We denote\nthese qubits as \"set 1\"). Meanwhile, sends her own qubits\nwith each of them being randomly in state |pi, p is either\n0 or 1. (We denote these qubits as \"set 2\"). Eve can\nremember the state of each qubits sent from her.\n(a2\u2032 ) After step (a3), Eve intercepts all qubits from\nBob and stores them. Note that all these qubits are from\nset 2 originally. Then, Eve sends set 1 to Alice.\n\n(a3\u2032 ) After step (a4), Eve intercepts all qubits from\nAlice and measures each of them in \u00b1 \u03c04 basis. Reading\nthe measurement outcome, Eve knows Alice's choice of\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n4 or \u2212 4 , i.e., the bit values of each pulse from Alice,\nk = 0, 1 for \u03c04 or \u2212 \u03c04 , respectively.\n(a4\u2032 ) According to the measurement result of each\nqubits from Alice, Eve takes appropriate unitary rotations to those qubits stored by her in step (a2\u2032 ) and sends\nthem to Bob. Explicitly, to any qubit, if its original value\np = 0, Eve rotates the polarization by (\u22121)k \u03c04 and sends\nit to Bob; if p = 1, she first flips its polarization between\n|0i and |1i and then rotates the polarization by (\u22121)k \u03c04\nand sends it to Bob. Bob will just implement step (a5)\nand in such a way, Bob will have no error after the protocol.\nKnowing that protocol 1 suffers from the above types\nof impersonation attack [1], they have proposed protocol\n2 and claimed that the modified protocol will be secure\nunder such attacks. We now show that Eve can access the\nfull information of the key from their modified protocol\nby almost the same impersonation attack. Let us first\nrecall their modified protocol.\nProtocol 2:\n(b1) Alice sends two single-photon pulses of the polarization angles \u03b81 and \u03b82 to Bob.\n(b2) Bob rotates the polarization angles of the pulses\nby \u03c6 + (\u22121)s \u03c04 and \u03c6 + (\u22121)s\u22951 \u03c04 ,where the shuffling\nparameter s \u2208 {0, 1} is randonmly chosen by Bob and\n\u2295 denotes addition modulo 2. And then Bob sends the\npulses back to Alice.\n(b3) Receiving the two pulses of their polarization angles \u03b81 + \u03c6 + (\u22121)s \u03c04 and \u03b82 + \u03c6 + (\u22121)s\u22951 \u03c04 , Alice rotates\nthe polarization angles of the pulses by \u2212\u03b81 + (\u22121)k \u03c04\nand \u2212\u03b82 + (\u22121)k \u03c04 respectively, where k \u2208 {0, 1} is the\nkey value. She blocks one of the qubits and sends the\nother to Bob. The paper [1] introduces the blocking factor b = 0, 1 to denote the case to let the first or the second\npulse go.\n(b4) When the qubit travels to Bob, he rotates the\npolarization angles of the pulses by \u2212\u03c6 and measures\nthe polarization. He obtains the measurement outcome\nlsk = s \u2295 k \u2295 b as the prekey bit value.\n(b5) Alice publicly announces her blocking factor b.\nAnd depending on b and the shuffling parameter s, Bob\n\n\f2\ncan decode the original key bit by k = s \u2295 b \u2295 l.\nOur attacking scheme is now the following:\n(b1\u2032 ) After step (b1), Eve intercepts and stores both\npulses from Alice. (We denote these pulses as \"set E1\").\nEve also sends two pulses to Bob. These two pulses are\noriginally produced by Eve with random polarization angles of \u03b81 \u2032 , \u03b82 \u2032 . Eve remembers the polarization angle of\neach pulses.\n(b2\u2032 ) After step (b2) in protocol 2, Eve intercepts both\npulses from Bob, rotates each of them by angle \u2212\u03b81 \u2032 , \u2212\u03b82 \u2032\nand stores them. (We denote these pulses as \"set E2\").\nEve chooses her shuffling parameter s\u2032 = 0 and ro\u2032\ntates the two pulses in set E1 by angle (\u22121)s \u03c04 and\nL\n\u2032\n(\u22121)s 1 \u03c04 respectively. Eve sends the rotated pulses\nin set E1 to Alice.\n(b3\u2032 ) After step (b3), Eve intercepts and measures the\npulse sent out by Alice in |0, \u03c02 i basis. By reading mea\u2032\nsurement outcome, she knows the value ls k = s\u2032 \u2295k\u2295b =\nk \u2295 b since the value s\u2032 is set by herself. (In our attacking scheme, s\u2032 = 0). Then she rotates the first pulse of\nset E2 with the angle of (\u22121)k\u2295b \u03c04 , sends it to Bob and\ndiscards the second pulse in set E2. (Remark: Although\nEve knows neither b nor k, she knows the value of k \u2295 b\nand she can do the unitary rotation dependent on k \u2295 b).\nWhen Alice announces the value of b i.e., which pulse\nshe has blocked, Eve can get the value of k since she has\nalready known the value of k \u2295 b and k = b \u2295 (k \u2295 b). On\nthe other hand, with the operation in step (b3\u2032 ), Bob's\n\nresult about k\u2212value will be identical to Alice's. Alice\nand Bob can not discover the eavesdropping. When Bob\nreceives the pulse after step (b3\u2032 ), he makes the measurement like step (b5) and will get the value lsk = s\u2295(k \u2295b).\nAlthough the b\u2032 value chosen by Eve may be different\nfrom the b value chosen by Alice, it does not cause any\nchannel noise since Eve's actions in our attacking scheme\nwill not affect Bob's measurement outcome for the value\nl, which is l = s \u2295 k \u2295 b.\nAlthough it is known protocol 1 is probably insecure\nunder impersonation attack [1], it has been assumed that\nprotocol 2 is secure prior to our comment. We have for\nthe first time shown the Protocol is totally insecure under our attack. Our eavesdropping method works even in\nthe case that Alice has a perfect single-photon source and\na transparent, noiseless channel. The protocols of blind\npolarization bases are insecure in their present forms [1].\nMoreover, in our present scheme, the quantum memories\nwhich are not practical in nowadays technology are not\nnecessary, a long enough delay of the photon will be sufficient. Therefore, our attacking scheme only need existing\ntechnology.\n\n[1] W-H.Kye et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 040501 (2005).\n\n\f"}
