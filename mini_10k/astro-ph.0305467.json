Gravitational lensing provides one of the cleanest ways to make this measurement. To date, the most\npowerful lensing probes of galactic mass have been multiply imaged QSO's (strong lensing of a\nbackground point source) and galaxy-galaxy lensing (weak deformation of many background galaxies). Here we point out that the mass associated with galaxies also lenses the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB) and this effect is potentially detectable in small scale experiments. The signal\nis small (roughly a few tenths of \u03bcK) but has a characteristic shape and extends out well beyond\nthe visible region of the galaxy.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nFlat rotation curves at large distance from galactic centers imply that the mass associated with a galaxy extends\nfar beyond the region that is visible. Indeed, it now appears that the vast majority of the mass of a galaxy is in an\nunseen component, dark matter. How much dark matter is there in a galaxy and how far out does the distribution\ngo? How does the matter associated with a single galaxy compare with the overdensity around that galaxy due to\nlarge scale structure? How is the dark matter distributed inside the galaxy? Is there substructure, as expected in\nsimulations of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) models [1, 2, 3], or does the absence of many satellites for our Galaxy imply\nthat the CDM models need to be modified [4, 5, 6, 7]?\nThese questions increasingly interest not only astrophysicists studying galaxies and their properties, but also cosmologists and particle physicists, for these phenomena may depend on the power spectrum of the matter in the\nuniverse. This in turn depends on such fundamental quantities as neutrino masses and the details of inflation. If the\nsubstructure dilemma remains, the properties of dark matter, such as its scattering cross-section or annihilation rate,\nmay be responsible. These properties may be important clues in identifying the elementary particles which constitute\nthe dark matter and the fundamental theory governing their interactions.\nThe traditional method of studying the mass distribution in galaxies \u2013 measuring rotation velocities \u2013 has recently\nbeen supplemented with a relatively new technique: studying the deflection of light rays as they pass by or through the\ngalaxy. There are a number of ways in which gravitational lensing can probe the mass distribution of an object like a\ngalaxy, but two have emerged recently as particularly promising. First is the phenomenon of multiply imaged QSOs.\nLight from a background point source (the QSO) gets lensed so that multiple images are seen. The separations between\nthese images, and more importantly their magnifications, are sensitive to the local mass distribution [8, 9, 10, 11, 12].\nSecond, images of background galaxies are distorted by a foreground lensing galaxy, and the amplitude of this distortion\nas a function of projected distance from the center of the lens galaxy contains important information about the mass\nassociated with that galaxy [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21]. Due to the presence of large scale structure, the lensing\nmass extends far beyond the visible region of the galaxy. If the diameter of the visible region is of order 10 kpc,\nthe region within a sphere almost a thousand times larger will be overdense. Understanding this overdensity is an\nimportant step along the way to understanding galaxy formation and the correlation between mass and light in the\nuniverse [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27].\nIn this paper, we explore the possibility that the most distant sources of all, the Cosmic Microwave Background\n(CMB) anisotropies generated at redshift z \u2243 1100, can serve as the sources which are lensed by foreground galaxies.\nThe problem is very similar to the lensing of the CMB by foreground galaxy clusters [28], except that the amplitude\nof the signal is considerably smaller here. The observed temperature T as a function of 2D position \u03b8~ on the sky is\n~\nT (~\u03b8) = T\u0303 (~\u03b8\u2032 ) = T\u0303 (~\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b4\u03b8)\n~ * \u2207T\u0303 (~\u03b8)\n\u2243 T\u0303 (~\u03b8) \u2212 \u03b4\u03b8\n\n(1)\n\n~ and \u03b4\u03b8 is the deflection due\nwhere T\u0303 is the background CMB field originating from the unlensed position \u03b8~\u2032 = \u03b8~ \u2212 \u03b4\u03b8,\nto the lens. As illustrated in [28], the CMB anisotropy field on small scales is almost purely a dipole (or gradient; on\nthese small scales the two terms are interchangeable); aligning the y\u2212 axis with the dipole leads to a simple expression\n\n\f2\nfor the observed temperature:\n\u2202 T\u0303\n\u00d7 (\u03b8y \u2212 \u03b4\u03b8y ) .\nT (~\u03b8) \u2243\n\u2202\u03b8y\n\n(2)\n\nHere \u2202T /\u2202\u03b8y is the temperature gradient, which is of course zero on average. Its rms fluctuation though is equal to\n0.22\u03bcK arcsec\u22121 in the standard \u039bCDM cosmology with \u03a9matter = 0.3, \u03a9baryon = 0.04, H0 = 70 km sec\u22121 Mpc\u22121\nand \u03a9\u039b = 0.7 (the rest of this paper assumes this background cosmology). The deviations from a pure dipole arise\n~ We will see that the deflection angle induced by the mass associated with a galaxy is\nfrom the deflection angle \u03b4\u03b8.\ntypically of order an arcsecond, so the expected signal is small, tenths of \u03bcK per galaxy. Eq. [2] breaks down on scales\nlarger than ten arcminutes when the background CMB no longer behaves as a pure gradient due to the power on the\nscales of the acoustic peaks [29]. Even on smaller scales, the \"noise\" due to the quadrupole can be significant as we\nwill see in \u00a7III.\n\u00a7II introduces the basic formula relating the deflection angle to the mass distribution and presents the deflection\nangle for several simple mass distributions. \u00a7III considers the lensing due to the large scale overdensities surrounding a\ngalaxy. These extend out to several Mpc (or tens of arcminutes for a galaxy at redshift 0.1). Given the resolution and\nsensitivity of current CMB experiments, this large scale lensing is likely to be the easiest target for future experiments.\nJust as in the galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements, the signal from a single foreground galaxy is quite small, so the\nstatistics of many galaxies must be used to beat down the noise. \u00a7IV discusses the foregrounds that might contaminate\nthis signal. We let our fancy take flight in \u00a7V where we consider the signal due to a single galaxy and show that in\nprinciple the lensed CMB can detect the sub-structure that simulations predict must exist in galactic halos. Observing\nthis signal would require experiments with significantly better resolution and sensitivity than those currently planned,\nbut if the small scale problems of CDM persist, we should keep this technique in mind as a way of definitively resolving\nthe \"small scale crisis.\"\nOne final comment about previous work. Several years ago, Peiris and Spergel [30] analyzed many aspects of the\nCMB-galaxy cross-correlations. Their analysis, focused on the WMAP experiment [31], and therefore is for scales\nlarger than we consider here.\nII.\n\nDEFLECTION ANGLE AND MASS MODELS\n\nThe deflection angle of a photon due to a galaxy at redshift zL , at comoving distance from us, \u03c7L , is [32]\n\"\n#\nZ\n~\n\u03b8 (\u03c7S \u2212 \u03c7L ) 1 + zL \u03c7L \u03b8/(1+zL )\n~\n\u03b4\u03b8 = \u22128\u03c0G\ndR R \u03a3(R) .\n\u03b8\n\u03c7S\n\u03b8\u03c7L 0\n\n(3)\n\nHere we take the photon to be emitted from a comoving distance \u03c7S = 1.4 \u00d7 104 Mpc away from us, corresponding to\nthe surface of last scattering. Its unperturbed path has at all times an angular distance \u03b8 from the axis connecting us\nto the center of the galaxy. The integral is over the two dimensional mass density \u03a3 of the galaxy, which is assumed\nto be azimuthally symmetric.\nA singular isothermal sphere has a density profile proportional to r\u22122 , so that the surface density is proportional\nto R\u22121 , where r (R) is the 3D (2D) radius from the center of the galaxy. For this profile then the term in square\nbrackets in Eq. [3] is independent of \u03b8 and the amplitude is fixed by the correlation length r0 defined via\n\u03c1(r) = \u03c1m (r0 /r)2 .\n\n(4)\n\nHere \u03c1m is the average matter density in the universe, so that 8\u03c0G\u03c1m = 0.9H02 with c/H0 = 4300 Mpc. The surface\ndensity for this distribution is \u03a3(R) = \u03c0\u03c1m ro2 /R, so the amplitude of the deflection angle due to a singular isothermal\nsphere is 0.9H02 \u03c0r02 = 1\u2032\u2032 (r0 /5.6 Mpc)2 for \u03c7S \u226b \u03c7L . Simulations [23] suggest that the distribution of matter around\ngalaxies, which is formally measured by the galaxy-mass cross-correlation function may indeed be represented by this\ndistribution with r0 \u2243 7 Mpc. The distortion, at least on scales larger than about 100 kpc, is therefore expected to\nbe constant with an amplitude of a little more than an arcsecond. Figure 1 shows this deflection angle; it falls off\non large scales since we do not include contributions from the density beyond r0 . Also shown is a more conservative\nchoice of \u03c1 = \u03c1m (r0 /r)\u22121.8 . Even for this choice, the expected deflection angle is of order an arcsecond.\nIt might seem at first that detecting such a small deflection will be hopeless given that the rms deflection of a\nphoton from the CMB is as much as 3 arcminutes. However, this is due almost entirely to lensing by large scale (low\nl) fluctuations. Large patches of the CMB sky will thus be nearly uniformly deflected by up to several arcminutes,\nhowever, by l = 104 , the rms deflection is down to about half an arc-second. Thus, CMB lensing by galaxies will take\nplace against a relatively smoothly-lensed background, which is still well described by a local dipole.\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 1: The deflection angle as a function of distance from the galactic center for several different mass models. The top two\ncurves have an overdensity equal to \u03c1m \u03be(r) with the galaxy-mass cross-correlation function equal to (7Mpc/r)\u03b1 and \u03b1 = 1.8\nand 2. The bottom curve is due to an individual halo with an NFW profile with concentration c = 8 and maximum rotational\nvelocity equal to 200 km sec\u22121 . The galaxy is assumed to be at redshift zL = 0.2 in order to obtain the relation between\nangular distance (bottom axis) and physical distance (top axis).\n\nThe above estimates are for a statistical sample of galaxies, accounting for the fact that the universe is clustered,\nso we expect halos of dark matter to reside near each other. These estimates definitely break down on scales smaller\nthan \u223c 100 kpc. On these smaller scales, a more appropriate distribution is given by the Navarro, Frenk, and White\n(NFW) [33] profile:\n\u03c1(x \u2261 r/rs ) =\n\n\u03c1s\n.\nx(1 + x)2\n\n(5)\n\nThe NFW profile can be described by two parameters: the scale radius rs and the density parameter \u03c1s . More\ncommonly, these are traded in for the concentration c, which is the ratio of the virial radius to the scale radius,\nand vmax , the maximum rotational velocity due to this mass distribution. The virial radius is defined as that within\nwhich the average density is equal to \u2206\u03c1m with \u2206 = 337 [34, 35] for the \u039bCDM model in which we are working. The\nmaximum rotational velocity can be determined analytically in terms of rs and \u03c1s ; it is vmax = 0.46(4\u03c0G\u03c1s rs2 )1/2 .\nFigure 1 shows the deflection due to an NFW profile with vmax = 200 km sec\u22121 and concentration c = 8.

It\nis useful to recap their technique to place galaxy-CMB lensing in context. They select lenses as those galaxies bright\nenough for spectra to have been taken (Petrosian magnitude r\u2217 < 17.6) and background galaxies fainter than 18th\nmagnitude. For the background galaxies, photometric redshifts are used. About 30, 000 lens galaxies are chosen from\nSDSS commissioning data and these are probed by about 3 \u00d7 106 background galaxies. Thus each lens has about\np a\nhundred background galaxies behind it. The error in the shear produced by a single foreground galaxy is 0.4/ Nbg\nwhere the 0.4 comes from a combination of instrumental noise and the intrinsic ellipticities of the background galaxies.\nThus, if Nbg = 100, the noise in the shear is 0.04. This is almost a factor of ten larger than the expected signal. So\nthe SDSS survey cannot detect galaxy-galaxy lensing due to a single galaxy. Instead they must average the signal\nover many foreground galaxies (each with a signal to noise of order 0.1). SDSS nevertheless provides a useful measure\nof the galaxy-mass correlation function because there are many (3 \u00d7 104 ) foreground galaxies over which to average.\nHow does the SDSS signal to noise compare to that obtainable with the CMB? We have determined (Eqs. [2] and\n[3]) that the expected signal in a CMB experiment is\nT (~\n\u03b8) \u2212\n\n\u2202T\n\u2202T\n\u03b8 cos \u03c6 =\nb(\u03b8) cos \u03c6\n\u2202\u03b8y\n\u2202\u03b8y\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03c6 is the angle between the angular position ~\u03b8 and the y-axis along which the background gradient is oriented\nand b(\u03b8) is roughly constant with an amplitude of order one arcsecond. We also need to consider the deviation of the\nbackground anisotropy pattern T\u0303 from a pure gradient. On scales larger than 5 \u2212 10\u2032 , the background field is more\ncomplicated. For simplicity we will assume that the background dipole can be removed but the quadrupole cannot,\nand it serves as a source of noise. That is, we consider the next term in the expansion of T\u0303 :\n\u2202T\n1\n\u2202 2 T\u0303\n\u03b8) \u2243\n\u03b8 cos \u03c6 + \u03b8i \u03b8j\n.\nT\u0303 (~\n\u2202\u03b8y\n2\n\u2202\u03b8i \u2202\u03b8j\n\n(10)\n\nThis second term on the right also has mean of zero, but variance equal to\n2\n\u03c3Q\n=\n\n3 4 X l5 Cl\n\u03b8\n= (1.5\u03bcK)2\n32\n2\u03c0\nl\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b8\n1\u2032\n\n\u00134\n\n(11)\n\nwhere the second equality holds in the standard cosmology we are considering. If the quadrupole cannot be removed,\nthen this source of noise adds in quadrature with that due to the atmosphere and/or instrument.\nWe can now compute the signal to noise expected for lensing of the CMB due to a single galaxy. Consider a CMB\nexperiment which maps the sky into Np pixels each of area \u2206\u03a9 with instrumental/atmospheric noise per pixel \u03c3n .\nThen,\n\u0012\n\nS\nN\n\n\u00132\n\n\u2202 T\u0303\n= h\n\u2202\u03b8y\n\n!2\n\ni\n\nNp\nX\n\n\u03c3n2\n\ncos2 \u03c6i\n2\n2 (\u03b8 ) b (\u03b8i )\n+ \u03c3Q\ni\n\n!2 Zi\n\u0014\n\u0010 1\u2032 \u0011\u0010 10\u03bcK \u00111/2 \u00152\n\u2202 T\u0303\nd2 \u03b8 cos2 \u03c6\n\u221a\n\u2243 h\nb i\n.\n2 (\u03b8) = 0.089\n\u2202\u03b8y\n\u2206\u03a9 \u03c3n2 + \u03c3Q\n\u03c3n\n\u2206\u03a9\n\n(12)\n\nSo, for a CMB experiment to achieve resolution comparable to SDSS (signal to noise per galaxy of 0.1), beams of\norder an arcminute with noise per pixel of order 10\u03bcK are needed. This is within the range expected of upcoming\nexperiments. A note of caution: the \u2243 sign in Eq. [12] is a warning that this signal to noise estimate assumes the\npixel size is significantly smaller than the scale at which the background dipole approximation breaks down; i.e.\n\u2206\u03a9 \u226a (10\u2032 )2 .\nOne might wonder whether, given the functional dependance of \u03b4 \u03b8~ on the lens distance/redshift (Eq. [6] and\nRef. [19] for example), it might not be more advantageous to look to higher redshift objects rather than SDSS galaxies\n\n\f5\nas lenses For example, lyman-alpha/star-forming regions at z \u2243 3 might be expected to give significantly higher a\nS/N . Studying the mass distribution in such objects would indeed be of significant interest; however, since these high\nredshift objects will subtend a significantly smaller solid angle than medium-to-low redshift galaxies, it will have to\nwait until a dramatic improvement in angular resolution before their CMB-lensing signal can be properly studied.\nWe therefore focus our attention on SDSS-type galaxies as lenses.\nSince the noise from the quadrupole dominates over instrumental noise when \u03b8 > 1\u2032 (\u03c3n /1.5\u03bcK)1/2, and a fair\nfraction of the signal comes from these larger scales, reducing instrumental noise is not as a important as going to\nhigher resolution and/or covering more sky. That is, signal to noise estimates typically scale as (\u2206\u03a9\u03c3n2 )\u22121/2 when\nthe dominant noise is instrumental. Here, though, the scaling is (\u2206\u03a9\u03c3n )\u22121/2 . For fixed resolution, then, the final\n1/2\n\u22121/2\n1/2 \u22121/2\nsignal to noise scales as Nrmgal \u03c3n\n\u221d Np \u03c3n . The number of pixels covered if the total time is fixed is inversely\nproportional to the time spent on each individual pixel, while \u03c3n is inversely proportional to the square root of time\nper pixel. Therefore, the final signal to noise scales increases as less time is spent on each pixel: an experiment intent\non measuring CMB-galaxy lensing should strive for large sky coverage at the expense of sensitivity.\nFor CMB experiments with larger beams, the approximation that the background source is a gradient breaks down.\nInformation is still contained in the cross-correlation of the CMB and galaxy surveys [30]. As we have seen the signal\nis of order a tenth of a \u03bcK, while the noise per pixel due to primordial CMB fluctuations is naively of order 50\u03bcK.\nWithout a sophisticated algorithm to extract the signal, we would then need of order 5002 galaxies to beat down the\nnoise. Going to larger redshifts to pick up these galaxies would not necessarily help since the galaxy-dark matter\ncross-correlation functions falls off at high redshifts, so the signal is significantly smaller. Also, a galaxy projects to\na smaller angular size at high redshift, necessitating even higher resolution. Although we do not pursue it here, two\npossible approaches are: (i) to assume the form of the lensing profile and fit for its amplitude [28, 30] or (ii) to extend\nthe likelihood technique developed by Hirata and Seljak [36] to this cross-correlation case.\nIV.\n\nNOISE\n\nBefore we assert that the lensing signal from galaxies is observable, we must identify the other potential sources\nof noise. Extensive discussions of CMB noise sources on small angular scales are to be found in [37, 38, 39], and are\nreviewed in [28] in the context of cluster lensing, where the issues are similar.\nThe expected sources of noise (other than detector noise and intrinsic noise from the CMB itself, both considered\nin \u00a7III) are: Galactic synchrotron, free-free and dust emission, thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) from galaxy clusters\nand filaments, kinetic SZ (including Ostriker-Vishniac) resulting from bulk gas motions, and unresolved point sources.\nWe briefly review each of these in turn.\n1.\n\nGalactic emissions\n\nGalactic synchrotron and free-free emission both decline with increasing l. Fluctuations due to free-free emission\nare already below 0.1\u03bcK by l = 104 above 30 GHz [39]. Above 100 GHz synchrotron emission fluctuations are below\n0.1\u03bcK by l = 103 ; at 30GHz they are predicted to be \u223c 2\u03bcK at l \u2243 1000, and declining as approximately l1/3\n[37]. This puts them below 1\u03bcK below one arcminute. Temperature fluctuations due to Galactic dust emissions are\nexpected to be below 1\u03bcK at frequencies below 217 GHz for l > 3000 if the dust emission is vibrational. The situation\nwas less clear if the dust emission is rotational [39], but the recent WMAP [40] constraints suggest that rotational\ndust will not be a problem.\n2.\n\nThermal SZ\n\nOf particular interest for galaxies being observed in the foreground of an SZ cluster, are fluctuations in the cluster\nSZ. Clusters will themselves have substructure \u2013 component galaxies, fluctuations in electron temperature and density\nacross the cluster. To the extent that these are resolvable, whether in the CMB data itself, in cluster radio maps, or\nin X-ray maps (especially with future X-ray interferometers), they could be subtracted and one could select as target\ngalaxies those that do not have significant cluster structure in their backgrounds.\nThe unmodeled thermal SZ foreground has been calculated by a number of groups [41, 42, 43]. The power is\nproportional to \u03c387 , so there remains significant uncertainty in the amplitude. If \u03c38 is set to its WMAP value of\n0.8 [44], then the expected rms amplitude of the thermal SZ on the scales of interest is of order 5\u03bcK. Of course, the\nsignal (or in this case, the noise) goes away at 217GHz so it is always possible in principle to avoid this source of\n\n\f6\ncontamination. (The relatvistic correction which spoils the null can be expected to be severely depresssed below the\n5\u03bcK level.)\n3.\n\nkinetic SZ and Ostriker-Vishniac\n\nThe kinetic SZ effect is the Doppler shift imprinted on CMB photons when they scatter off electrons in a moving\ngas. In the linear regime for the matter fluctuations this is called the Ostriker-Vishniac (OV) effect [45]. The kinetic\neffect has the same spectral shape as the primordial CMB (and the lensing signal we are after) so it is more difficult to\neliminate than the thermal effect. The amplitude of the effect though is of order 2\u03bcK [41, 43, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52],\nso it is not a major stumbling block.\n4.\n\nPoint Sources\n\nToffolatti et. al. [38] considered the contribution of unresolved point sources to fluctuations in the anisotropy of the\nCMB on 1-100 arcminute scales, at the 8 Planck wavebands from 30GHz to 857GHz. These sources include, in the\nlow frequency channels, radio loud AGNs, flat-spectrum radio-galaxies, quasars, and high-z BL-Lacs. Dust emission\nfrom distant dust-rich young galaxies is the dominant source at higher frequencies. Assuming that point sources with\nflux below 1mJy remain unsubtracted, they find (figures 5 and 6) that in all channels h(\u2206T /T )2 i1/2 > 10\u22126 at 1\narcminute (best channel \u2013 143 GHz), and in many cases is much bigger. It is also increasing with decreasing \u03b8 as\napproximately \u03b8\u22121 , suggesting that in the best channels (between about 44 and 150 GHz) we can expect point sources\nto contribute about 5-10 microK of noise at 6 arcsecond , and maybe 10-15 microK of noise at 1 arcsecond.\nTo make much improvement in these noise figures you would need to be able to accurately subtract very low flux\npoint sources \u2013 about 0.1 mJy to achieve a a factor of 3, 0.01mJy to get down an order of magnitude. It is also\ntrue that point sources will not exhibit the coherent extended structure expected from lensing and may possibly be\nfiltered out. The biggest confusion is likely to arise if we attempt to use galaxy lensing to measure the proto-galactic\nsubstructures. On this scale the foreground dust emission is dominant. However, it also has a rather different energy\nspectrum than the SZ-distorted CMB, which may aid in its subtraction.\n5.\n\nOther Sources of Confusion\n\nThere are several other effects that produce signals similar to that considered here. Moving clusters produce\nnonlinear corrections to the Integrated Sachs Wolfe Effect on small scales, and the pattern produced has the same\nstructure as that due to lensing. The signal is quite small though[53, 54] (\u223c 0.3\u03bcK) and on larger scales than interest\nus. Coherent electron rotational velocities in clusters lead to a dipolar signature[55, 56] and these are on relatively\nsmall scales. But the amplitude is also very small and the induced signal is not aligned with the cosmic dipole.\nV.\n\nSINGLE GALAXY LENSING\n\nThe lensing signal due to the halo surrounding a single galaxy is given by Eq. [6]. Since the signal is very small, we\ncannot hope to measure it with the current, or even currently planned, CMB experiments. Here we simply motivate\nfuture experiments by illustrating that the potential pay-off is large: lensing of the CMB in principle allows us to\ndifferentiate between an NFW profile and an isothermal profile, thereby testing one result of numerical simulations.\nMore ambitiously, very high resolution measurements could detect the sub-structure predicted by current theories of\nstructure formation.\nDetecting the shape of the dark matter profile around a single galaxy with CMB lensing requires resolution and\nsensitivity far beyond current capabilities. Figure 2 shows the different signals induced by an NFW profile and an\nisothermal profile. The galaxy is situated at z = 0.1 (the lower the redshift, the larger it appears, and therefore the\nless difficult is the issue of resolution). A number of groups [35] have found that typical values of the concentration\nparameter of galaxies at redshift one are 5 \u2212 10 in CDM models. The galaxy doing the lensing in Figure 2 has\nconcentration parameter equal to eight and a maximum circular velocity of 200 km sec\u22121 . This corresponds to a scale\nradius rs = 44 kpc and a virial mass of 2 \u00d7 1012 h\u22121 M\u2299 .\nEven Figure 2, with its optimistic noise and resolution parameters, paints too pretty a picture. For, we have\nneglected all foregrounds, save for the local quadrupole of the CMB. Noise due to the quadrupole kicks in at surprisingly\nsmall scales, because of the exquisite sensitivity required to discriminate these models.\n\n\f7\n\nFIG. 2: Anisotropy induced by lensing by an NFW dark matter profile (solid curve) and an isothermal sphere (dashed straight\nline), with the galaxy sitting at redshift 0.1. The galaxy is chosen to have concentration 8 and scale radius equal to 44 kpc\n(corresponding to maximum rotational velocity of order 200 km sec\u22121 ). Errors are shown for a 5\u2032\u2032 beam with 0.4\u03bcK instrumental\nnoise per pixel. Light error bars do not include noise from the background quadrupole; larger, heavier bars do.\n\nThe surface density of a smooth NFW profile with these parameters is depicted in Figure 3. Unhindered by\nexperimental complications, we are led to ask whether a smooth NFW profile could be distinguished from the clumpy\nprofiles found in simulations.\nTo construct a clumpy halo, we use the distribution of sub-halos measured by [1]. They find that the cumulative\nnumber of halos with circular velocity greater than vmax is roughly equal to 0.03(vmax/vparent )\u22123 . This means that\nthe distribution of halos\n(\n\u0010 3\n\u0011\nvparent\n0.09\nvmax > vcutoff .\n4\nvmax\ndn/dvmax \u2243\n(13)\n0\notherwise\nHere the lower cut-off arises because we don't know what the simulations predict on such small scales. Note that with\nthis distribution, if we take vcutoff = 0.05vparent, there are 240 sub-halos in the galaxy.\nTo generate a distribution of velocities of sub-halos, first normalize Eq. [13] to unity: dnnorm /dvmax =\n(1/N )dn/dvmax and then given a random number \u03b7 between zero and one, define the velocity of one sub-halo v\nvia\nZ v\ndnnorm\ndvmax\n\u03b7=\n.\n(14)\ndvmax\nvcutoff\nIn this case we can do the integral analytically, so\nvmax =\n\nvcutoff\n.\n(1 \u2212 \u03b7)1/3\n\n(15)\n\nWe can use the same technique to generate the spatial distribution of halos. Suppose that the number of halos is\ndistributed according to an NFW profile. We want \u03a3(R) from the sub-structure to follow an NFW profile. The total\nRR\nmass within a radius R is 2\u03c0 0 dR\u2032 R\u2032 \u03a3NFW (R\u2032 ). So the fraction of the total mass which is within R is\nR R/rs\n\ndx x \u03a3NFW (x)\n\u03b7(R) = R R0 /r\n.\nmax\ns\ndx x \u03a3NFW (x)\n0\n\n(16)\n\n\f8\n\nFIG. 3: Log of the surface density of a galaxy at redshift one. Axes are in units of arcsec. Left Panel: NFW profile with a\nscale radius equal to 44 km and a maximum circular velocity of 200 km sec \u22121 . Right Panel: The same mass distributed in 240\nsub-halos.\n\nHere we have cut off the distribution at Rmax = 10rs ; note that \u03b7 lies between zero and one, so a random number\nbetween zero and one can be associated with a given value of R. The angular coordinate of the sub-halo is also\nassigned randomly. This distribution is shown in the right panel of Figure 3.\n\nFIG. 4: Temperature profile due to lensing of the background CMB by a foreground galaxy at redshift one.

Note the characteristic signal first pointed out in Ref. [28]: a hot and cold lobe on either side of the galactic center. (Here we have\nsubtracted off the dipole.) Traces of the substructure are still evident in the right panel of Figure 4. However, these\nare much less obvious than those in the surface density plot of Figure 3. The similarity of the two panels in Figure 4\nis reflection of the fact that the galaxy is lensing a large \"sheet,\" the background dipole, as opposed to the point-like\n\n\f9\nQSO's with which we are more familiar [57].\n\nFIG. 5: The signals shown in Figure 4 smoothed with a 5 arcsec beam.\n\nA realistic CMB experiment will have a finite width beam. Figure 5 shows the results of smoothing the signal with\na beam of full width half maximum of 5\u2032\u2032 . Even after such smoothing, there remains a noticeable difference between\nthe clumpy and smooth galaxies.\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nMass surrounding a galaxy lenses the background cosmic photons arriving from the surface of last scattering at\nz \u2243 1100. This lensing can be used to probe the dark matter distribution around galaxies. On the relevant scales \u2013 of\norder an arcminute \u2013 the background is nearly a dipole, and the amplitude of the signal is of order 1\u2032\u2032 \u00d7\u2202T /\u2202\u03b8 \u223c 0.2\u03bcK.\nThis signal can be used in two fundamentally different ways. On the one hand, one can average over many foreground\ngalaxies so as to obtain a measure of the galaxy-mass correlation function. We have shown that given enough sky\ncoverage a CMB experiment with an arcminute beam size and noise of 10\u03bcK per pixel would be able to make a\nmeasurement of this correlation function that is competitive with SDSS. Instruments like the Penn Bolometric Array\n\u2013 a 3mm camera for the 100m Green Bank telescope \u2013 hold some promise for beginning a more detailed exploration\nof galaxy mass distributions. It is worth noting that, unlike measurements of lensing-induced shear or amplification,\nwhich are sensitive to the second derivative of the lens gravitational potential, \u03a6, this proposed measurement of the\ndeflection angle is sensitive to \u2207\u03a6. In principle, the inversion to obtain \u03a6, is far easier from \u2207\u03a6 than from \u2207\u2207\u03a6.\"\nIn the distant future, we might be able to go further and probe the dark matter halo of an individual galaxy. For\nnoise levels reached today, the signal to noise from a single galaxy is of order 1/100. Either noise levels will have\nto come down appreciably, or a different source needs to be used. This latter option is intriguing. One particularly\nappealing possibility is to use the gradient caused by the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect (the scattering of\nCMB photons by electrons in an ionized plasma) from a background galaxy cluster. This results from CMB photons\nscattering off hot electrons in the cluster's ionized IGM. A typical expected temperature gradient is of order 500\u03bcK\narcmin\u22121 , almost two orders of magnitude above that from the primordial CMB. If a galaxy were positioned along\nthe line of sight to a cluster, where the SZ effect would look nearly like a gradient on sub-arcminute scales, then we\nwould expect the galaxy lensing signal to be \u223c 5 \u2212 10\u03bcK. This is then comparable to current noise levels in CMB\nexperiments, so might be the best hope of measuring this fascinating signal in the near future.\nThe work of SD is supported by the DOE, by NASA grant NAG5-10842, and by NSF Grant PHY-0079251.
