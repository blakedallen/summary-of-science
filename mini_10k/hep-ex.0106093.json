The mixing effects are parameterized\nby two dimensionless amplitudes\nx=\n\n\u2206M\n\u0393\n\nand y =\n\n\u2206\u0393\n,\n2\u0393\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u2206M is the mass difference between the two mass eigenstates, \u2206\u0393 is the width difference and \u0393\n0\nis the average width. In the Standard Model, the D 0 \u2212D system mixing rate (Rmix = 21 (x2 + y 2 )) is\ngenerally believed to be much smaller than the current experimental sensitivity 1 . Nevertheless, recent\nmeasurements hint at a possible mixing effect at the edge of sensitivity. We report here on two such\nstudies made with the FOCUS data.\nThe data were collected by the FOCUS Collaboration during the 1996-97 Fermilab fixed target\nrun in the Wideband Photon beam line using an upgraded version of the E687 spectrometer 2 . Charm\nparticles are produced in the interaction of high energy photons (hEi \u2248 180 GeV) with a segmented BeO\ntarget. In the target region, charged particles are tracked by 16 layers of silicon microstrip detectors\nwhich provide excellent vertex resolution. The momentum of the charged particles is determined by\nmeasuring their deflection in two oppositely polarized, large aperture dipole magnets with five stations\n\n\f2\n\nD yield/(1 MeV/c )\n\nData\nBackground\nSignal\n\n350\n300\n\n(b)\n\n250\n200\n\n0\n\n(a)\n\n150\n100\n50\n0\n\n0.14 0.15 0.16 0.17\n2\nWS mass difference GeV/c\n\nFigure 1: (a) The decay reduced proper time distribution for the selected D0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + and K + K \u2212 events.

In this study 3 , the final state K + K \u2212 is used as the\nCP even final state and, in the absence of a suitable CP odd candidate, the CP mixed state K \u2212 \u03c0 +\nis used. Assuming that K \u2212 \u03c0 + is an even mixture of CP even and CP odd the relationship between\nthe two lifetimes and the mixing parameter y is given by\ny=\n\n\u0393CP\n\u0393CP\n\n\u2212 \u0393CP\neven + \u0393CP\neven\n\nodd\nodd\n\n=\n\n\u03c4 (D \u2192 K\u03c0)\n\u2212 1.\n\u03c4 (D \u2192 KK)\n\n(2)\n\nThe lifetime distributions for the 10 331 decays to K + K \u2212 and 119 738 decays to K \u2212 \u03c0 + are shown\nin Fig. 1a. From exponential fits to the distributions we find \u03c4 (D \u2192 KK) = 395.7 \u00b1 5.5 f s and\n\u03c4 (D \u2192 K\u03c0) = 409.2 \u00b1 1.3 f s where the errors are statistical (systematic errors are only evaluated on\nthe ratio). Plugging these lifetimes into Eq. (2) we obtain y = (3.42 \u00b1 1.39 \u00b1 0.74)%.\nStudy of the Decay D 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212\n\n3\n\nThe process D 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 may occur through either a doubly Cabibbo suppressed (DCS) decay, or by\n0\n0\nD 0 mixing to D followed by the Cabibbo favored (CF) decay D \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 . The expected rate for the\nDCS decay relative to the CF decay (Rdcs ) is approximately tan4 \u03b8C \u2243 0.25%, while Standard Model\n0\nbased predictions for Rmix range from 10\u22128 to 10\u22123 . The large uncertainty in the D 0 \u2212 D mixing\nrate is due to mixing mediated by intermediate meson states 4 whose contributions are not calculable\nin perturbative QCD. Nevertheless, large cancellations among the various intermediate meson states\nare expected and most studies conclude that the mixing rate should be at least a couple orders of\nmagnitude less than 10\u22123 level 5 . Also, effects from beyond the Standard Model may enhance Rmix .\nIn this study 6 , we begin by measuring the rate of D 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 decays relative to D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + a .\nThe neutral D flavor is determined by requiring the decay chain D +\u2217 \u2192 \u03c0 + D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + (K\u03c0). This is\na\n\nCharge conjugate modes are implicitly included.\n\n\fachieved by looking for a narrow signal at 145 MeV/c2 in the mass difference between the D \u2217 and D\ncandidates. The mass difference distribution for D 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 candidates is shown in Fig. 1b. We find\n149 \u00b1 31 D 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 events compared to 36 760 \u00b1 195 decays of D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + for a branching ratio of\n(0.404 \u00b1 0.085 \u00b1 0.025)%.\nThe time dependence of the D 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 decays is given by\n\u0015\n\u0014\np\n1 \u20322 \u20322 2 \u2212t\n\u2032\n(3)\nR(t) = Rdcs + Rdcs y t + (x +y )t e ,\n4\nwhere x\u2032 and y \u2032 are phase rotations of x and y given by x\u2032 = x cos \u03b4 + y sin \u03b4 and y \u2032 = y cos \u03b4 \u2212 x sin \u03b4\nwith \u03b4 the strong force phase between the CF and DCS processes. Clearly, Eq. (3) indicates that in the\ncase of significant mixing the measured branching ratio is dependent on the lifetime acceptance of the\nanalysis. To account for this effect a large Monte Carlo sample of D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + decays is used. Each\nMonte Carlo event accepted in the analysis is given a weight determined by the relative probability\nfor an event with its lifetime given by Eq. (3) divided by the probability for the same lifetime in the\nexponential decay rate used to generate the Monte Carlo. In this way we derive a relationship for\nRdcs as a function of x\u2032 and y \u2032 which depends only on the measured branching ratio, and the first and\nsecond moments of the accepted lifetime distribution in the Monte Carlo. The functional dependence\non x\u2032 in the experimentally allowed region is small, while the dependence on y \u2032 (shown in Fig. 2a for\nthe case of x\u2032 = 0) is large. For comparison, the y \u2032 and Rdcs ranges from CLEO II.V 7 and the y limit\nfrom FOCUS (discussed in Sect. 2) are also shown in this figure.\nTo determine limits on x\u2032 , y \u2032 and Rdcs , the D \u2192 K\u03c0 data is split into high and low lifetime\nsamples. The D 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 branching ratio determined in each sample can be used to generate high\nand low lifetime curves in y \u2032 Rdcs space like the one shown in Fig. 2a. The point where these curves\ncross indicates the preferred values of y \u2032 and Rdcs . To quantitatively determine the 95% confidence\nlevel (CL) allowed range, we integrate the likelihood for all points in the space and assign the 95% CL\nboundary to the high and low values beyond which the total integrated likelihood is equal to 2.5%. In\ndetermining y \u2032 (Rdcs ) limits the value of x\u2032 is set to zero (the value of x\u2032 with greatest likelihood) and\nwe integrate over the entire allowed range Rdcs (y \u2032 ) variable. Using this procedure we find preliminary\nlimits of\n\u22120.124 < y \u2032 < \u22120.006\n\nand\n\n0.43% < Rdcs < 1.73%.\nThe large upper limit on Rdcs and large negative lower limit on y \u2032 are the result of a second crossing\npoint of the high and low lifetime curves. This property is an unfortunate side effect of using only one\nlifetime split \u2013 the fitting procedure 6 and limited statistics prevent more data splits. Nevertheless,\nthe second crossing and its associated limits are far outside the allowed region of CLEO II.V 7 and are\nalso expected to be ruled out by the improved limits on x\u2032 and y \u2032 from FOCUS semileptonic mixing\nstudies.\nTo determine a limit on |x\u2032 | we integrate over the entire allowed range of y \u2032 and Rdcs obtaining\nthe preliminary limit of\n|x\u2032 | < 0.039.\nWe also determined a 95% CL boundary in x\u2032 y \u2032 space by integrating over all allowed values of Rdcs and\nselecting the boundary line that is isometric in likelihood and contains 95% of the total likelihood. This\nboundary is shown in Fig. 2b. Also shown in Fig 2b are the best existing limits from the semileptonic\nmixing (E7918 ), lifetime differences (FOCUS) and D 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 (CLEO II.V).\n4\n\nConclusions\n0\n\nWhile the recent measurements in D 0 \u2212 D mixing do not rise to the level of a discovery, they do\nwarrant further study. A discovery of a non-zero y at the percent level (Rmix \u223c 10\u22124 ) would not\n\n\f(%)\n\nx' = 0.0\n\n1\n\nFOCUS\ny from\nLifetime\nDifferences\n(\u03b4=0)\n\n0.8\nRDCS\n\nE791 K l \u03bd\n+ CLEO K \u03c0\nFOCUS \u2206\u0393\n+ FOCUS K \u03c0\nPreliminary\n+-\n\n(b)\n10\n\n0.6\n\n5\n\ny'\n\n(%)\n\n1.2\n\n(a)\n\nRange of\ny not y'\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n0.4\nCLEO II.V\n0.2\n0\n\n-10\n\n-0.06\n\n-0.04\n\n-0.02\n\n0\ny'\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n95% CL Regions\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\nx'\n\n15\n\n(%)\n\nFigure 2: (a) The functional dependence of Rdcs on y \u2032 with x\u2032 = 0. Fit values of y \u2032 and Rdcs from CLEO II.V 7 and\nthe the FOCUS value for y from the lifetime difference study are shown for comparison. All errors are 1 \u03c3 combined\nstatistical and systematic. (b) The 95% confidence level allowed regions for x\u2032 and y \u2032 from the E791 semileptonic study 8 ,\nthe CLEO II.V study of D0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 and the FOCUS study of D0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 , and the FOCUS limits on y from lifetime\ndifferences. The direct measurement of y is only comparable to measurements on y \u2032 in the limit of strong phase \u03b4 = 0.\nFor the measurements of y \u2032 and y to be in agreement at the 1 \u03c3 level requires \u03b4 & \u03c0/4 9 .\n\nnecessarily indicate new physics, but it would be unexpectedly large, and at the very least would lead\nto a deeper understanding of the processes involved in meson mediated mixing.\nThe current data from FOCUS and CLEO II.V suggest two possible scenarios. The first scenario\nis that there is y-like mixing at the few percent level and a large (\u223c \u03c0 radians) strong phase. The\nsecond scenario is that some or all of the recent measurements are fluctuations. New measurements\nare required to determine which of these two possibilities is correct.\n0\n\n1.
