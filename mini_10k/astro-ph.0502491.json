The most important properties of\na catalogue with 427 entries and significant subsets are analysed. The complete sample\ncontains 183 statistically confirmed ELGs in a sky area of 151 deg2 and redshift up to\n0.14. We determine the parameters of the H\u03b1 luminosity function using the H\u03b1 + [NII]\nflux directly measured on the ELGs spectra in this sample and the star formation rate\ndensity derived is in agreement with the values reported in the literature. Finally, we\nstudy the clustering properties of local star-forming galaxies relative to quiescent ones\nfrom different perspectives. We find that emission-line galaxies avoid dense regions of\nquiescent galaxies and we propose a power-law expression to parametrise the relation\nbetween star formation rate density and environment volume density of emission-line\ngalaxies.\nKey words: surveys - galaxies: luminosity function, star formation - cosmology: large\nscale structure\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe star formation rate density (\u03c1SFR ) in the Local Universe and the spatial distribution of emission-line galaxies\n(ELGs) as a function of environment are fundamental pieces\nin the field of formation and evolution of galaxies. There\nare few techniques as good as slitless spectroscopy for bulksearching of this object class. From the mid 1960s to the\nnear past the photographic plates were used as unique detectors in the search on ELGs (e.g. MacAlpine, Smith & Lewis\n1977; Wasilewski 1983; Pesch & Sanduleak 1983; Markarian,\nStepanian & Erastova 1986; Popescu et al. 1996; Surace &\nComte 1998 and references therein; Ugryumov et al. 1999).\nThe UCM (Universidad Complutense de Madrid) survey\n(Zamorano et al. 1994) is one of the more recent initiatives\ndevoted to the photographic searching of ELGs and their\nfindings motivated this work. Substitution of photographic\nplates by large-format CCDs, including CCD mosaics, is re-\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: abongiov@cida.ve (ABP); bruzual@cida.ve (GBA)\n\nally a challenge for many observatories with competitive\naperture Schmidt telescopes, some of them equipped with\nobjective-prisms. Consequently, the CCD-based objectiveprism surveys could be taken as a promising technique for\nthe search of extragalactic emission-line systems. Examples\nof two successful objective-prism digital surveys are presented by (Sabbey et al. 2001) and (Gronwall et al. 2004, and\nreferences therein, hereafter KR2), the latter best known as\nthe KPNO international spectroscopic survey, KISS.\nThe CIDA-UCM-Yale (Centro de Investigaciones de Astronom\u0131\u0301a, Universidad Complutense de Madrid and Yale\nUniversity) survey1 , hereafter CUYS, is the first stage of\nan observational effort with the main goal of identifying\n\n1\n\nThe data presented here were partially extracted from the\nQUEST1 Collaboration raw data repository. QUEST1 is short for\nthe Quasar Equatorial Survey Team, and it was the first collaboration between groups from Yale University, Indiana University,\nCentro de Investigaciones de Astronom\u0131\u0301a (CIDA), and Universidad de Los Andes (M\u00e9rida, Venezuela).\n\n\f2\n\nA. Bongiovanni, G. Bruzual, G. Magris, J. Gallego, C.E. Garc\u0131\u0301a-Dab\u00f3, P. Coppi and C. Sabbey\n\nand studying emission-line galaxies (ELGs) based on digital\nlow-resolution spectra in contrast with spectroscopic surveys\nwhich involve follow-up observations or multifiber instruments. Once the second part of this equatorial objectiveprism survey is completed, we expect to have catalogued\nmore than 10,000 ELGs with blue and red low-resolution\nspectra (4,000-9,200 \u00c5) over \u223c 600 deg2 . The CUYS is being carried out in the 1m Schmidt telescope located at the\nVenezuelan National Astronomical Observatory, Llano del\nHato, M\u00e9rida, Venezuela 2 . This telescope is equipped with\na 3.4\u25e6 objective-prism (reciprocal dispersion \u223c25 \u00c5 arcsec\u22121\nin H\u03b1 at rest) and a 4 \u00d7 4 CCD mosaic covering 2.3\u25e6 \u00d7 3.5\u25e6\non the sky. The CCDs are 2048 \u00d7 2048 LORAL devises with\n15\u03bcm pixels. The camera and its operation details are fully\ndescribed in Baltay et al. (2002).\nOur strategy to select ELGs is the detection of H\u03b1 +\n[NII]6549, 6584 \u00c5 emission on reduced 1-dimensional spectra of extended sources listed in the APM catalogue (Irwin\n1990). Because objective-prism dispersion decreases in the\nred portion of the spectra, absorption bands present in latetype star spectra could generate false emission line detections. To avoid these contaminants, among others, we chose\nto ignore the spectra of point-like sources. Taking into account the galactic latitude range of the CUYS observations,\ndata reduction allowed us to obtain a statistically complete\ncatalogue of active star-forming galaxies and to study the\nspatial distribution of these objects on medium and large\nscales (above \u223c 3 Mpc). Several approaches have been used\nto study this topic during the last 15 years. It is well established that ELGs can be found near structures defined\nby luminous normal galaxies (Schechter 1976) or populating\nlow galaxy density regions in the nearby universe (Popescu,\nHopp & Elsaesser 1997). Consequently, there is a relation between mean star formation rate (SFR) and environment in\nthe sense that \u03c1SFR decreases as the galaxy number density\nincreases (e.g. Gisler 1978, Dressler, Thompson & Schectman 1985, Lewis et al. 2002). Recently, G\u00f3mez et al. (2003)\nhave established an inverse relation between environmental surface density and SFR measured using ELGs from the\nSDSS. A plausible explanation is that the high mean SFR\nin low density environments of the local universe is only a\ncontrast effect resulting from the mild SFR in high density\nregions in which galaxies are stripped of their gas with more\nprobability.\nThis paper is organized as follows. An analysis of the\ncatalogue properties is the aim of section 2. In section 3\nwe use the resulting CUYS ELG catalogue to find the parameters of the H\u03b1 Luminosity Function (LF) and estimate\nthe \u03c1SFR in the Local Universe using fluxes and equivalent widths (EW ) measured directly from objective-prism\nspectra. In section 4 we analyse the spatial distribution\nof ELGs in our survey in terms of the 2-point correlation\nfunction and other statistical estimators related to the spatial distribution at large scales. We conclude in section 5.\nThroughout this paper, we adopt the standard notation\nh = H0 /100 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 and the cosmology \u03a9m = 0.3\nand \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, nevertheless the latter assumption has not\nmuch effect on the redshift range of our survey.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nOperated by CIDA and funded by the Ministerio de Ciencia y\nTecnolog\u0131\u0301a, Venezuela.\n\nObservations\n\nObservations were performed in the second half of 1999 and\nthe beginning of 2000 with the instruments described above.\nThe use of a red cut-off filter (6300-9200 \u00c5) allowed us to\nminimize the overlapping of spectra, especially in crowded\nzones, profiting at the same time from the CCDs best response in this wavelength range. This instrumental combination limits the H\u03b1+[N II] detection in redshift to z 6 0.4.\nData were collected using the driftscan technique, which is\nalso referred to as time-delay integration mode (McGraw,\nCawson & Keane 1986). From 23 scans (\u223c 0.21 Tbytes) we\nselected the best 18 (which covered repeatedly almost the\nsame regions). We detect objects with continuum magnitudes down to R \u223c 20. These scans cover the equatorial sky\nbetween coordinates 08h 6 \u03b1 6 18h and \u22122.4o 6 \u03b4 6 +0.1o .\nFrom the surveyed region, we selected the best sampled\nzones, which represent about 250 deg2 . The different atmospheric conditions prevailing during the observing nights\nand the artificial broadening of the spectra introduced by the\ndriftscan mode (produced by residual effects due to the motion of the spectral sagitta and spread in the rate of motion\nof spectra across the finite width of a single CCD, Baltay et\nal. 2002), result in an average full width at half maximum\n(fwhm) of the spectra of \u223c 3 arcsec in the spatial direction.\n\n2.2\n\nData Reduction\n\nTo process the observations we used the objective-prism\ndata analysis package from Sabbey (1999), in a version modified by the authors. We omit a detailed description of this\npackage and only mention the more important steps of the\nanalysis. (a) Extraction of the astrometric database from\nthe USNO-A V2.0 catalogue (Monet et al. 1998) for object identification; (b) Generation of calibration files (bias\nlevel, flat field vector and bad column list) for each CCD;\n(c) Determination of linear coordinate transformation between the astrometric database and the driftscan strip world\ncoordinates. We used the centroid of the telluric A band\n(O2 , 7580-7750 \u00c5) as a reference to guide the positioning\nof the spectra in one of the image axis; (d) Extraction of\nwavelength calibrated 1-dimensional spectra for each object\nidentified in the USNO-A V2.0 catalogue; (e) Coaddition of\n1-dimensional spectra (four for each driftscan, i.e. 560 s of integration time) in a database created for this purpose, which\nalso provides information to discard cosmic rays; (f) Extraction of raw ELG candidates applying an optimal emission\nline detection algorithm; (g) Flux calibration and analysis\nof ELG candidate spectra that matched with the previous\nselection of sources identified as extended in the bJ \u2212 and\nr\u2212band digitized images of the APM catalogue to discard\npossible contaminants in the light of the CUYS goals, i.e.\nlate-type stars and QSOs. (h) Finally, study of the 1-D spectra of selected candidates, using the Image Reduction and\nAnalysis Facility (IRAF3 ) software.

To avoid this we chose to rule out APM pointlike sources spectra and only use the confirmed APM extended and paired sources. Taking into account the coverage of the CUYS in galactic latitude (from \u223c 30o to 62o ),\nwe discard between 1390 to 3420 K and M type stars deg\u22122 ;\nthese quantities were calculated using the Bahcall & Soneira\n(1980) model. Additionally, we estimate that nearly 4-5 QSO\ndeg\u22122 (Crawford 1995) are rejected before any data processing effort using this method. Conversely, our method\nintroduces a bias against very compact ELGs: near 8 per\ncent of star-like ELGs were found in the UCM survey list\n3 sample and 11 per cent were morphologically classified as\ncompact ELGs (Alonso et al. 1999). Obviously, this bias did\nnot affect the UCM survey. In absence of simulations better\nqualified than this observational fact, we presume that 30 to\n40 ELGs in the final CUYS catalogue were lost due to the\nselection effect introduced by excluding star-like ELG candidates presumably included in the set of point-like sources\ninitially ignored. These numbers demonstrate the advantage\nof point-like source rejection as a previous step to the individual ELGs candidates processing, in spite of the bias\ndescribed. This acquires special relevance when the followup spectroscopy is not foreseen in the original observational\nproject.\nWith respect to the flux calibration, it was carried out\nusing the optical continuum of 15 AGNs spectra observed\nat the 2.5 m DuPont telescope by Sabbey (2001, unpublished), and included in the CUYS catalogue, to construct\nthe average sensitivity curve for each column of the CCD\nmosaic. Such curves were used for the flux calibration of the\nCUYS spectra. The sensitivity curve reliability was doublechecked using the colour-selected F8 sub-dwarf secondary\nstandards spectra obtained from the SDSS Data Release 2\n(Abazajian et al. 2003, hereafter SDSS2) instead of AGNs\nspectra. These standards were originally used in the SDSS\nfor their spectra calibration. Previously, we ruled out those\nsecondary standards with known photometric variability in\nperiods from days to years, using data from the QUEST\nRR Lyrae Survey (Vivas et al. 2004, hereafter QRR). The\n\nresulting sensitivity curves are consistent (1\u03c3) with those\nobtained using AGN continua.\nFinally, the extraction of raw ELG candidates followed\nthe combination of three different criteria: The S/N ratio,\nthe fwhm and the observed EW of emission lines on each\nspectrum. Several experiments were performed to achieve\noptimum values and a balance between completeness and\nlow contamination. The result was a step function of observed EW and emission line S/N ratio for candidate selection. An EW \u2248 40 \u00c5 and emission line S/N \u2248 4 were\nadopted as initial security thresholds. Above these values\nit is possible to avoid false emission detections (Schneider,\nSchmidt & Gunn 1994). Once cosmic rays were discarded\nand additional criteria for physical emission confirmation\nwere applied, the spectra were subject to a final visual\ninspection. The completeness analysis below demonstrates\nthat the application of these criteria allowed us to create a\nstatistically significant catalogue of ELGs.\n\n2.3\n\nSurvey Results\n\nThe CUYS results are presented as a catalogue of ELGs.\nThe entire catalogue can be inspected in the CIDA homepage.5 It contains 427 entries and a summary of the first 10\nis listed in Table 1. Astrometric positions (J2000.0) and R\nmagnitudes of the ELG candidates were extracted from the\nUSNO-A V2.0 catalogue. Instrumental photometry (V and\nR Johnson-Cousins bands) from QRR for 73.5 per cent (314\nobjects) of the catalogue is shown in Fig. 1. The median\ncolour V \u2212 R is 0.49, a value between representative ones\nfor Hubble types Im and Scd, 0.34 and 0.57, respectively\n(Fukugita, Shimasaku & Ichikawa 1995).\nGlobal properties of the CUYS catalogue, in terms of\nEW and H\u03b1+[NII] fluxes are shown in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. The median of each distribution is shown together\nwith representative values for the UCM (Gallego et al. 1996)\nand KR2 surveys. The median values for the CUYS catalogue are between the medians for the other surveys, providing an objective measurement of the shallowness of our\nsurvey relative to previous ones of similar nature. The limitations in prism dispersion and CCD scale do not allow us to\n5\n\nAvailable at http://www.cida.ve/\u223cabongiov/CUYS/elgcata.txt\nin ASCII format.\n\n\f4\n\nA. Bongiovanni, G. Bruzual, G.

This colour is comparable to the\ncolour of local Hubble types Im and Scd reported by Fukugita,\nShimasaku & Ichikawa (1995).\n\nFigure 2. Distribution of H\u03b1 + [NII] reduced equivalent widths\nfor the CUYS ELG candidates. The survey has good sensitivity\nfor EW > 30 \u00c5. The median values for CUYS, UCM and KR2\nare indicated.\n\ndetect ELG candidates with EW < 30 \u00c5 (see below). Thus,\nin this work we detect only the contribution of the most\nvigorous extragalactic star-forming systems, neglecting the\nbulk of ELGs with low-EW . Despite this handicap of our\nsurvey, we show that it is possible to obtain fair results with\nthese data.\nFrom the original list of ELGs we selected a subset comprised by 273 objects belonging to the connected sky region\nbetter sampled in the survey. This subset contains ELG candidates with emission lines blueward of 7750 \u00c5 to avoid\nconfusion with telluric A-band absorption in low resolution\nspectra. This results in a redshift cut-off of z \u223c 0.14 for\nH\u03b1 + [NII] ELG. This subset is denoted hereafter as the\nUniform Subset (UnSu).\n2.4\n\nComparison with SDSS results\n\nTaking into account that the CUYS was originally designed to study the properties of the telescope-CCD mosaicobjective-prism combination, a dedicated follow-up spectroscopy of ELG candidates was disregarded, in part due\nto the availability of SDSS data releases after the first part\nof the CUYS was finished. We intend to make the best use\nof our observational effort and to compare the results of the\nCUYS survey with previous surveys.\nThe ELG candidates included in the UnSu are represented in the top of Fig. 4 (dots). About 80 per cent of\nthis angular extent overlaps the large sky zone explored by\nSDSS. From the SDSS2 we extracted common objects (using equatorial coordinates, apparent brightness in R band\nand redshift as matching parameters) in the overlapping region (\u03b1 6 236o ) as well as their spectra. We find that all\nof them (190) are extragalactic emission-line systems (in-\n\nFigure 3. Distribution of H\u03b1 + [NII] fluxes for the CUYS ELG\ncandidates. The median values for CUYS, UCM and KR2 are\nindicated.\n\ncluding AGN), represented in Fig. 4 by circled dots. The\nhistograms in this figure show the distributions of coordinates diference between CUYS and SDSS2 objects in common: 66% of these differences are below \u223c 0.3 arcsec in both\ncoordinates.\nThere are 46 CUYS objects with \u03b1 6 236o present in\nthe SDSS2 imaging database, but not in the spectroscopic\n\n\fThe CIDA-UCM-Yale Shallow Survey for Emission Line Galaxies\ndatabase. The SDSS2 images of such objects were inspected\nindividually to find the possible reasons for this exclusion.\nUsing the brightness (rpet ) distribution of the SDSS2 objects that match with the CUYS ELGs, we find that 16 possibly are too bright to be included in SDSS2 spectroscopic\ndatabase, 5 objects are too faint and 25 objects are complex\n(paired) systems. The latter fall in the spectroscopic data\nhole category. Despite we do not have confirmation about\nthe presence of emission lines in their spectra, these objects\nare considered hereafter as H\u03b1 + [NII] ELG.\nFrom the perspective of the SDSS2, 90 per cent or more\nof the CUYS objects can be accepted as reliable ELGs. A\ncomparison of the ELG redshifts and H\u03b1 + [NII] fluxes between the CUYS and the SDSS2 common objects is shown\nin Fig. 5. The SDSS2 integrated fluxes were obtained from\nthe original spectra degraded to the prism characteristic dispersion with the purpose of integrating the contribution of\nH\u03b1 and [NII]6549, 6584 lines into a single line to be fitted as\nthe H\u03b1+[NII] emission line of the CUYS spectra. The correspondence is evidently quite good, nevertheless the intrinsic\nerror associated with the CUYS absolute flux calculation is\nbetween 4 and 8 per cent, whereas the redshift uncertainty\nis below 0.01. The dispersion in the flux correlation between\nthe SDSS2 and the CUYS common objects, especially those\nwith low H\u03b1 + [NII] flux, could be due to the small and single aperture used in the SDSS spectroscopy defined by the\nsize of their fibers, in contrast with the CUYS. This could\nexplain the slight overestimation of the CUYS flux as compared to SDSS2 H\u03b1 + [NII] flux, below 10\u221214 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 .\nOn the other hand, if all H\u03b1 + [NII] emission-line systems from the SDSS2 (in the sky zone that overlaps the\nCUYS) are extracted and analysed, the results are comparable with the CUYS in number, redshift (z 6 0.15), H\u03b1+[NII]\nfluxes and EW , but only for EW > 30 \u00c5. Nearly 81% of\nemission-line systems in SDSS2 (944 in this sky region) have\nEW < 30 \u00c5 (median=16.4 \u00c5) and the CUYS is insensitive\nto these objects. In other words, the results obtained by\nboth surveys are nearly identical if we restrict SDSS2 to\nELGs with EW (H\u03b1 + [NII]) > 30 \u00c5.\n2.5\n\n5\n\nFigure 4. On the top, a map with the CUYS UnSu (273 ELGs,\ndots). Circled dots (190 objects) are CUYS candidates included\nin the SDSS2. Objects with \u03b1 > 236o (38) are not present in the\nspectroscopic SDSS2 dataset. Single dots with \u03b1 6 236o represent\nCUYS UnSu objects that do not match SDSS2, mainly because\nthey are possibly too bright to be included in SDSS samples.\nDistributions in the other two panels correspond to the differences\nin equatorial coordinates between CUYS (USNO-A V2.0) and\nSDSS2 astrometry.\n\nSurvey Completeness\n\nThe completeness of the ELG sample was determined using the V /Vmax test (Schmidt 1968). A sample is considered\ncomplete below some apparent magnitude, assuming an uniform distribution of objects, when the average < V /Vmax >,\ndefined by\nV\nr\n= [ ]3 = 100.6\u00d7(m\u2212mC )\nVmax\nrC\n\n(1)\n\nreaches a value of \u223c 0.5. In this equation the subindex\nC corresponds to the completeness limit for which V /Vmax\nis being computed. This test indicates that the CUYS is\nstatistically complete if we include all objects in the UnSu\nwith mL+C = \u22122.5 log(fL+C )\u221216.32 6 18.05. This subsample of 183 objects will be called the Complete Subsample\n(CoSu). The last equation defines an arbitrary magnitude\nscale m \u2261 mL+C as a function of the line + continuum flux\nfL+C (in erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 ), and the completeness magnitude\nwas obtained by successive aproximations of this expression.\nThis apparent brightness formalism was used originally by\nSchechter (1976). The zero point of mL+C in this survey was\n\nFigure 5. On the top, the redshift (zSDSS2 ) of SDSS2 objects\nversus redshift catalogued in our survey (zCUYS ).

Using this magnitude scale, we performed\nan independent completeness estimate following Surace &\nComte (1998), which apparently is less sensitive to space\ndensity fluctuations in the sample. The results agree with\nthose obtained using < V /Vmax >: the same completeness\nlimit is reached at mL+C = 18.15, with 193 objects. We\nadopt the < V /Vmax > estimate and the results of the test\nare given in Table 2.\nConcerning the completeness of the survey at the bright\nend, we are missing a few objects with mL+C < 15, whose\nspectra may appear saturated in our scans. This bias does\nnot affect our conclusions below in a statistical sense. At the\nfaint end, the cause of a possible deficit is discussed in the\nnext section.\n\n2.6\n\nCatalogue Contamination\n\nA source of catalogue contamination is the possible presence in our sample of z > 0.4 ELGs with emission features different from the H\u03b1 + [NII] blend, which are bright\nenough to produce good S/N ratio prism spectra. To obtain\nan idea about the fraction of these objects in the CUYS\ncatalogue we followed the prescription of Jones & BlandHawthorn (2001), based on the expected fluxes of the H\u03b1,\n[OIII]4959,5007, H\u03b2, and [OII]3727 lines, which could eventually be confused with H\u03b1 + [NII] in our spectra. This\nanalysis demonstrates, for example, that at an H\u03b1 flux of\n\u223c 6 \u00d7 10\u221216 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 , the probability of finding objects\nwith [OIII]4959,5007 emission in place of H\u03b1 for the CUYS\nspectral range is \u223c 5 per cent. Our estimate for the minimum\nH\u03b1 flux that we detect, at least in the CoSu, is 4.62 \u00d7 10\u221215\nerg s\u22121 cm\u22122 , about one order of magnitude higher than\nthe value quoted above. Consequently, there is no evidence\nof contamination by lines different to the H\u03b1 + [NII] blend\nin the spectra of the objects that belong to the CUYS catalogue, as it was confirmed using SDSS2 data.\n\n2.7\n\nSpectral Classification of CUYS ELGs\n\nFinally, a description of the CUYS sample would not be\ncomplete without including the spectral classification of\nthe galaxies. We have separated the ELGs in three different classes: HII region-like ELGs, SB-like (Starburst) ELGs\nand AGN or \"active galaxies\". HII region-like class corresponds to a synthesis of HIIH and DHIIH types and SBlike class comprises SBN and DANS types, all described\nby Gallego et al. (1996). This classification was performed\nonly for descriptive purposes and using strictly spectroscopic\ncriteria. Fig. 6 is a representation of the diagnostic diagram log([OIII]5007/H\u03b2) versus log([NII]6583/H\u03b1), useful\naccording to Veilleux & Osterbrock (1987) for spectral classification of ELGs. Data for these emission lines were extracted from 180 matched SDSS2 spectra with measurable\ndiagnostic lines, using the IRAF task splot. The objects\nwhose spectra are analyzed here belong to the UnSu, therefore the work done here do not implies the extraction of\nall AGNs present in the CoSu, but to have a very clear\nidea about the fraction of different spectral classes of ELGs\npresent in our largest subsample. The analysis of the SDSS2\nmatched spectra reveals that \u223c 18 per cent of the CUYS\nsample is composed by AGN (squares). From the 143 starforming galaxies plotted, 36 are HII region-like ELGs (triangles) and 107 are SB-like (circles).\nWe have overplotted on the the diagnostic diagram a sequence of models for star-forming galaxies (Magris, Binette\n& Bruzual 2003), to obtain an accurate idea about metallicity and burst age of surveyed ELGs. The solid line segments\njoin models of constant metallicity, whereas dotted lines join\nmodels of equal ionization parameter.\nThe sequences correspond to an instantaneous burst of\nstar formation, with age between 0 and 2 Myr. We observe\nthat 91 per cent of the star-forming galaxies sample lies on a\nlocus with a metallicity between 0.4 and 1\u00d7Z\u2299 . The remaining objects (HII region-like ELGs) have lower metallicities.\nThe broad distribution of star-forming galaxies in this diagram can be understood as due to dispersion in the age of\nthe burst.\n\n3\n\nCUYS H\u03b1 LUMINOSITY FUNCTION IN\nTHE LOCAL UNIVERSE\n\nThe ELG CoSu was used to derive an H\u03b1 Luminosity Function (LF) whose integral value represents an estimate of\n\u03c1SFR in the Local Universe.\nTo fit the LF we compute the number \u03a6 of galaxies per unit volume and per unit H\u03b1\u2212luminosity interval\n0.4 log L(H\u03b1), given by\n4\u03c0 X 1\n\u03a6[log L(H\u03b1)] =\n,\n(2)\n\u03a9 i Vimax\nwhere \u03a9 is the surveyed solid angle (\u223c 0.046 str) and\nVimax is the volume enclosed by a sphere of radius equal\nto the maximum distance the galaxy could be from the\nith\u2212object and still be detected in the survey (Schechter\n1976). The sum is performed over all the objects whose luminosity falls in the interval L(H\u03b1) \u00b1 0.5 \u2206 log L(H\u03b1).\nFollowing the reasoning above, the Schechter function\ncan be rewritten as\n\n\fThe CIDA-UCM-Yale Shallow Survey for Emission Line Galaxies\n\nFigure 6. Diagnostic diagram log([OIII]5007/H\u03b2) versus\nlog([NII]6583/H\u03b1) for 180 CUYS ELGs with counterparts in the\nSDSS2 sample. Using the prescription of Veilleux & Osterbrock\n(1987) and spectroscopic criteria referred in the text, nearly 80\nper cent of the CUYS sample can be regarded as HII regionlike ELGs (triangles) and SB-like ELGs (circles). The remaining\nobjects were classified as AGN (squares). Solid line segments represent a sequence of models for star-forming galaxies according\nto Magris, Binette & Bruzual (2003), as described in the text.\n\n\u03a6[log L(H\u03b1)] d log L = \u03c6(L)dL,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c6(L)dL \u2261 \u03c6\u2217 (L/L\u2217 )\u03b1 exp(\u2212L/L\u2217 )d(L/L\u2217 ). In\nthe Vimax method, galaxies are assumed to be distributed\nhomogeneously and, for this reason, its great advantage is\nsimplicity. Nevertheless, the data were subject to other classical fitting schemes (Felten 1977, Eales 1993) and the results\nagree, within errors, with the ones obtained from the Vimax\nmethod.\nWe use a median value for the ratio (H\u03b1 + [NII])/H\u03b1 =\n1.3 derived from the SDSS2 galaxies in common with our\nsample to correct objective-prism H\u03b1 + [NII] fluxes for the\ncontribution by [NII]. This value, derived from original and\ndegraded resolution SDSS2 spectra, is consistent with the\n1.33 value reported by Kennicutt (1983) and Gallego et al.\n(1997), which is widely used in the literature for local ELGs.\nL(H\u03b1) for each galaxy was dust corrected stochastically via 104 Monte Carlo simulations of intrinsic reddening A(H\u03b1), whose distribution is represented on the top\nof Fig. 7. The calculation of the reddening is based on\nthe theoretical Balmer decrement H\u03b1/H\u03b2 = 2.86 (Osterbrock 1989), assuming case B recombination, Te = 104\nK and ne = 102 cm\u22123 ; in the case of AGNs, we used\nH\u03b1/H\u03b2 = 3.10. We take the Withford extinction curve that\nsatisfies k(\u03bb) = A\u03bb /E(B \u2212 V ) and use the Seaton (1979)\nlaw, which gives k(H\u03b1) = 2.49. The A(H\u03b1) distribution behaviour is a polynomial fit of the binned inverse distribution\nfunction.\nUnlike the alternative LF(H\u03b1) calculation that follows\nin this section, we assume that the A(H\u03b1) correction prob-\n\n7\n\nability for each ELG in the Monte Carlo realisations is, in\nprinciple, the same. Obviously, the A(H\u03b1) correction likelihood for each galaxy is conditioned by the shape of the\ndistribution function represented on the top of Fig. 7. The\nintrinsic reddening A(H\u03b1) was calculated using the E(B\u2212V )\ncolour excess and observed intensity ratios H\u03b1o /H\u03b2o from\n165 SDSS2 spectra corresponding to \u223c61 per cent of the\nUnSu. In the simulations we also include the error distribution functions for galaxy H\u03b1 flux and redshift.\nThe three lower panels of Fig. 7 contain the Schechter\nfunction parameters distributions (log \u03c6\u2217 , \u03b1 and log L\u2217 , respectively) for the LF obtained from Monte Carlo experiments (99.5 per cent confidence level). Inside each distribution the median and it deviation (1-\u03c3) is represented as a\nbar. These 1-\u03c3 deviations were adopted as the corresponding error parameter in this approach, whose representation\nis shown in Fig. 9 (solid thick line).\nWe also implemented a simpler form to correct the\nL(H\u03b1) by reddening. It consists in deriving a correlation of\nE(B \u2212 V ) with absolute magnitude MB just as presented by\nJansen, Franx & Fabricant (2001), but using the data from\nthe 165 SDSS2 galaxy spectra. A linear fit between these\nvariables is shown in Fig. 8. The rms of the residuals reaches\n\u223c0.2 mag in color excess, which represents a H\u03b1 extinction\nof about 0.6 mag. We agree with these authors in the scatter\nin this trend. In spite of this, the correlation was used to correct L(H\u03b1) for each galaxy individually and the parameters\nof the LF(H\u03b1) were calculated using a Marquardt-Levenberg\nleast-squares fit: log L\u2217 = 42.06\u00b10.14, \u03b1 = \u22121.35\u00b10.16 and\nlog \u03c6\u2217 = \u22123.12 \u00b1 0.25. This LF(H\u03b1) is represented in Fig. 9\nby a solid thin line. The number distribution of CoSu objects used in this LF calculation is shown in the bottom of\nthe figure. The error bars in the points are Poissonian errors.\nDespite the relative shallowness of the CUYS, the parameter values and associated errors obtained with both\napproaches are acceptable. The stochastic method favours\nslightly the fainter luminosities whereas the alternative approach, the brighter ones. We adopt the parameters resulting from stochastic aproximation to the LF(H\u03b1) calculation\nproblem because it takes into account the error distribution\nfunctions for galaxy H\u03b1 flux and redshift. The resulting LF\nparameters from this method are listed in Table 3 together\nwith values for different surveys performed after the UCM\nsurvey (Gallego et al. 1995) for comparison purposes, and\nall of them shown in Fig. 9. A number defect in CUYS\nLF(H\u03b1) at fainter luminosities is evident when it is compared with previous estimations. This is evidently related\nto the CUYS selection effects, mainly the absence of ELGs\nwith EW < 30\u00c5 and, to a smaller extent, the exclusion of\npoint-like ELGs as part of the data reduction process.\nGiven a Schechter function aproximation to the H\u03b1 luminosity distribution in the volume of local universe considered, the integrated H\u03b1\u2212luminosity L(H\u03b1) has the value\nL(H\u03b1) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u03c6(L) L dL = \u03c6\u2217 L\u2217 \u0393(2 + \u03b1),\n\n(4)\n\n0\n\nwhich is given in the last line of the Table 3. All the\nestimates in Table 3 seem very similar, the CUYS L(H\u03b1)\nis the smallest value, but it is very close to the estimate of\nGallego et al. (1995). Probably, our number defect of ELGs\nis real in the volume of universe surveyed. We need to stress\n\n\f8\n\nA. Bongiovanni, G. Bruzual, G. Magris, J. Gallego, C.E. Garc\u0131\u0301a-Dab\u00f3, P.

Below we study the relation between star\nformation and environment conditions from three different\nperspectives.\n\n\fThe CIDA-UCM-Yale Shallow Survey for Emission Line Galaxies\n\nFigure 9. LF(H\u03b1) determinations for the surveys listed in Table 3. The solid thick line corresponds to the CUYS LF corrected\nfor dust and errors via Monte Carlo experiments. The solid thin\nline that fits the discrete values is the CUYS LF with dust correction using Jansen, Franx & Fabricant (2001) prescription as is\ndescribed in the text. Bars are Poissonian errors. On the bottom\nof the figure is the number distribution of CoSu ELGs used in this\nLF calculation. The dotted line corresponds to the Gallego et al.\n(1995) LF, the short-dashed line to Tresse & Maddox (1998), the\nlong-dashed line to Sullivan et al. (2000) and the dot-dashed line\nto the Nakamura et al. (2004) fit.\n\n4.1\n\nReference Catalogue and Qualitative\nEnvironmental Effects\n\nFirst, we wish to compare the CUYS ELG spatial distribution with a deeper sample of galaxies than the usual bright\ngalaxy catalogues. As a first reference catalogue (RC1) we\nuse a subset of 9,364 quiescent galaxies from the spectroscopic sample of SDSS2, with R 6 18.15 and z 6 0.14 as\nthe selection criteria. The completeness limit of the SDSS\ngalaxy catalogue to z \u223c 0.1 is rpet 6 17.8 (Blanton et al.\n2003). This selection resembles the CUYS sample in terms\nof limiting flux and volume of universe. From the RC1 we extracted galaxies that match the CUYS CoSu. Unfortunately,\nthe angular overlap between both catalogues forced us to\nlimit the CUYS CoSu to 132 deg2 (161 objects). A representation of the RC1 and the CUYS CoSu (trimmed) in velocity\nspace can be seen in Fig. 10. It is easy to distinguish density\nenhancements in the distribution of RC1 galaxies in redshift\nspace. To obtain an estimate of the RC1 galaxy clustering,\nwe use the Huchra & Geller (1982) Friends-of-Friends (FoF)\nalgorithm for group and cluster finding in magnitude-limited\nsamples of galaxies (with D0 = h\u22121 0.4 Mpc, the projected\nseparation chosen at some fiducial redshift and V0 = 350 km\ns\u22121 , adopted as parameters after various trials). We find 307\ngroups with between 5 and 350 members each. We discarded\ngroups with less than 5 members. Once the group and cluster catalogue was constructed, we divided the CUYS CoSu\nin two subsets: grouped, associated with one or more quies-\n\n9\n\nFigure 10. Pie diagram with RC1 galaxies (small dots; 9,364\nobjects) and CUYS CoSu ELG (triangles; 161 objects) that lie in\nthe same volume.\n\ncent galaxy groups (17 objects), and isolated ELGs (144 objects). We find a ratio SF Risolated /SF Rgrouped = 1.4 \u00b1 0.3.\nIf we use the CfARS catalogue from Huchra et al. (2001,\nprivate communication) for double-checking this result, this\nratio reaches 2.1 \u00b1 0.5. The CfARS catalogue is complete to\nB = 15.24 and the sample used for our purposes has 669\ngalaxies. It seems clear that the average star formation in\nlow density environments is about a factor of 1.5 to 2 greater\nthan in group and cluster regions, at least when galaxies\nwith copious star formation are used as tracers of the SFR.\n4.2\n\n2-point Correlation Functions\n\nWe used the RC1 and the CUYS CoSu (trimmed) sets of\ngalaxies to examine clustering properties by means of autocorrelation algorithms in redshift space. With this purpose,\nwe adopt the correlation function (CF) formalism proposed\nby Hamilton (1993). This correlation function estimator is\ndefined by\n\u03be(s) =\n\nhN N (s)ihRR(s)i\n\u2212 1,\nhN R(s)i2\n\n(7)\n\nwhere N N (s) is the number of catalogue galaxies in the\ninterval [s, s + ds], RR(s) is the number of pairs in the same\ninterval in the random catalogue (\u223c 20 times larger than the\nsize of data sample), and N R(s) is the number of pairs in the\ncombined sample with this separation. The angular brackets\nin this equation denotes average over all pairs separated by\ns in the galaxy sample.\nThe error in the CF estimate is defined as the standard\ndeviation at each point where the CF was measured. To\ndiminish boundary effects, the RC1 sample was enhanced by\n2 degrees in angular dimension and the random catalogues\nwere re-sampled in each simulation.\n\n\f10\n\nA. Bongiovanni, G. Bruzual, G.

This\nindicates that the ELGs are anti-clustered, or that they are\narranged regularly in redshift space at smaller scales. The\ngalaxy correlation function can be approximated by a powerlaw (Peebles 1980)\n\u0012 \u0013\u2212\u03b3\ns\n,\n(8)\n\u03be(s) =\ns0\nwhere s0 is the correlation length (defined as \u03be(s0 ) \u2261 1)\nand \u03b3 is the power-law slope. The top panel of Fig. 11 shows\nestimates of the redshift space 2-point CF for each sample.\nThe results of the fits are given in Table 4.\nThe points in Fig. 11 are distributed in 1 h\u22121 Mpc bins\nreaching up to \u223c 11 h\u22121 Mpc, where the known shoulder\nin \u03be(s) is not yet appreciable. Moreover, beyond this limit,\nthe CF determination for the CUYS CoSu was unacceptably\nnoisy. We include for reference in Table 4 and Fig. 11 the fit\nobtained by Zehavi et al. (2002) for general galaxy clustering\nin the SDSS Early Release (SDSSER). A power-law fitting\nfor the CUYS CoSu was possible only in the scale range\n3.5-8.5 h\u22121 Mpc.\nIt is evident that the clustering amplitude in this scale\nrange is similar in the 3 samples. ELGs appear to be practically as clustered as SDSS2 galaxies. On the other hand,\nbelow 3.5 h\u22121 Mpc, ELGs seem 2 to 5 times less clustered\nthan quiescent galaxies. The bias pictured in the bottom\npanel of Fig. 11, defined as the ratio \u03beCUYS /\u03beSDSS2 , shows\nan asymptotical behaviour on scales s > 3 h\u22121 Mpc with\nan apparent shoulder on smaller scales that should be confirmed with larger ELG samples.\n4.3\n\nEnvironment and SFR density\n\nAs indicated in the introduction to this paper, a recent and\ndetailed analysis about the effect of environment on the star\nformation activity in the local universe was published by\nG\u00f3mez et al. (2003). They found that the SFR in nearby\ngalaxies is strongly correlated with the projected galaxy density in at least three diferent (and complementary) ways: (a)\nthe decrease of the overall SFR distribution in dense environments compared to the field population; (b) this effect\nis most noticeable for the stronger star-forming galaxies; (c)\nthe existence of a characteristic density in the density-SFR\nrelation at a local galaxy density of \u223c 1 h275 Mpc\u22122 .\nDespite the limitations imposed by the absence of a\nmorphological classification of CUYS CoSu ELGs and the\nrelative small size of this subsample, we have extracted additional information about the effects of environment on SFR\ndensity. The availability of a characteristic correlation lenght\ns0 for the CUYS ELGs give us the opportunity to use a different approach in the quantification of the environmental\neffects discussed in the section 4.1.

The bottom panel shows the bias between the CUYS\nCoSu and the SDSS2 sample correlation function, defined as the\nquotient of both quantities.\n\nrates the regime of large spatial density fluctuations from the\nregime of small fluctuations. The latter can be interpreted\nas a homogeneous galaxy distribution, but this is a current\ntopic of debate (Gaite, Dom\u0131\u0301nguez & P\u00e9rez-Mercader 1999).\nWe now use the CUYS CoSu correlation length s0 as\na characteristic radius to compute the environment galaxy\ndensity in the redshift space. This corresponds to an ELGcentric perspective of the environmental effects on star formation.

The\nresults are expressed as a distribution function in Fig. 12.\nThe inverse proportionality between the environment and\nthe SFR spatial density is not only evident, but a powerlaw behaviour describes rather well this phenomenon.

The size, covered sky area, and H\u03b1 + [NII] flux distribution, make our survey competitive with other modern\nELG surveys. Technical limitations forced us to search and\nfind ELGs with EW (H\u03b1) > 30 \u00c5. Thus, all the work in this\npaper refers to local galaxies with vigorous star formation.\nOur main results can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 Objective-prism searchs for ELGs provide a productive and cheap method to generate large catalogues of local SB-like, HII region-like and active galaxies. We used the\ndriftscan technique, coadding 1-dimensional reduced spectra\nfrom multiple scans of the same region of the sky.\n\u2022 The typical colour of ELGs in our sample is V \u2212 R =\n0.49, comparable to the mean colour of local Hubble types\nIm and Scd. The analysis of the diagnostic diagram for\nspectral classification reveals that more than 80 per cent\nof the CUYS ELGs can be considered star-forming galaxies.\nFrom this fraction, nearly 75 per cent is dominated by SBlike ELGs. Photoionization models imply that these galaxies\nhave metallicities between 0.4 and 1\u00d7Z\u2299 with instantaneous\nbursts of star formation aged less than 2 Myr.\n\u2022 Compared with the LF(H\u03b1) derived from deeper surveys, the CUYS LF(H\u03b1) shows good agreement with previous results except in the low H\u03b1 luminosity region, where we\nfind a small deficit attributed to the survey selection effects.\nNevertheless the star formation rate density that we calculate is in agreement with values reported in the literature.\n\n11\n\n\u2022 On average, the SFR for galaxies associated with\ngroups/clusters of quiescent galaxies is 0.5 to 0.7 times the\nvalue for isolated ELGs. The fraction of ELGs regarded as\ngrouped versus isolated is 0.1; additionally, the mean density ratio between star-forming and quiescent galaxies is on\nthe order of \u223c 2.5. Thus, it is clear that ELGs avoid dense\nregions of quiescent galaxies.\n\u2022 ELG clustering is statistically indistinguishable from\nquiescent galaxy grouping in redshift space scales from 3.5\nto 8.5 h\u22121 Mpc. Between \u223c 1 and 3 h\u22121 Mpc, ELGs are\n2 to 5 times less clustered than quiescent galaxies, whereas\nbelow 1 h\u22121 Mpc (\u223c1 Abell radius) in redshift space, ELGs\nare anti-clustered or they are arranged regularly. This result\nis in agreement with the hierarchical galaxy formation scenario. Perhaps today ELGs are isolated systems that have\nnot yet started the merging process. Conversely, merged\ngalaxies that formed isolated luminous galaxies or today\ncluster galaxies, have been depleted of enormous amounts\nof gas and they show today few star formation events.\n\u2022 Finally, we propose a parametrization of the relation\nbetween SFR density and environment density. As far as\nthis survey is concerned, there seems to exist a continuum\ndependence between these variables which can be described\nby a power-law.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe are especially grateful to CIDA colleagues who have\nparticipated in different discussions about topics directly\ninvolved in this paper.
