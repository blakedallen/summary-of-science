We conclude that triple images of lensed\nQSOs do not show any direct evidence for dark dwarf galaxies such as cold dark matter\nsubstructure.\nKey words: cosmology: theory \u2013 dark matter \u2013 galaxies: haloes \u2013 methods: numerical\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nCold Dark Matter (CDM) simulations predict many more\nlow mass satellite haloes than are actually observed in the\nMilky Way (Klypin et al. 1999, Moore et al. 1999). It seems\nthat 10-15% of the mass was left in satellites with perhaps\n1-2% at the projected separations of 1\u20132 Einstein radii (Re )\nwhere we see most lensed images (e.g. Zentner & Bullock\n2003, Mao et al. 2004); this is far larger than the observed\nfraction of 0.01\u20130.1% in observed satellites (e.g. Chiba 2002).\nSolutions to this mismatch were proposed in three broad\nclasses: satellites are present but dark if star formation is\nprevented (Bullock, Weinberg & Kravtsov 2000), satellites\nare destroyed due to self-interacting dark matter (Spergel &\nSteinhardt 2000), or their formation is prevented by changing the power spectrum to something similar to warm dark\nmatter with significantly less power on the relevant mass\nscales (e.g. Bode et al. 2001). These hypotheses left the major observational challenge of distinguishing dark satellites\nfrom non-existent ones. This became known as the CDM\nsubstructure problem.\nIt has been argued that a possible signature of the presence of dark matter substructures can be found in strong\ngravitational lensing of QSOs (Mao & Schneider 1998; Met\u22c6 E-mail: andrea@physik.unizh.ch\nc 2005 RAS\n\ncalf & Madau 2001; Chiba 2002; Metcalf & Zhao 2002; Dalal\n& Kochanek 2002: Kochanek & Dalal 2004). If a distant image source is close to a cusp (from inside) in a caustic curve,\nthree of the images will be clustered together and the sum\nof their magnifications will be zero (Zakharov (1995), taking\nthe negative parity image to have negative magnification).\nThis relation holds for a wide class of smooth analytic lens\nmodels (Keeton et al. 2003); on the other hand all known\nobserved lensed QSOs violate this relation. This has been\nexplained with the presence of cold dark matter substructures within the lensing galaxy's halo.\nHowever, the discrepancy found in some systems may\nbe due to microlensed stars rather than to cold dark matter\nsubstructures (Keeton et al. 2003), even if the most peculiar\nproblem is the anomalous flux ratios in radio lenses. Radio sources are essentially unaffected by the ISM of the lens\ngalaxy (see however Koopmans et al. 2003), true absorption\nappears to be rare, radio sources generally show little variability and most of the flux should come from regions too\nlarge to be affected by microlensing. Therefore dark matter\nsubhaloes appear to be the most likely explanation.\nBy using low resolution simulation of galaxy formation\nBradac et al. (2004) claimed that the level of substructures\npresent in simulation produces violations of the cusp relation comparable to those observed. Amara et al. (2004) implanted an idealized model of a galaxy into the center of a\n\n\f2\n\nAndrea V. Macci\u00f2 & Marco Miranda\n\nhigh resolution galactic halo extracted from dissipationless\nN-Body simulations to test the effects of substructures on\nlensed images. Their findings contrast those of Bradac et al.\n(2004), since they found that the substructures produced in\na \u039bCDM halo are not abundant enough to account for the\nobserved cusp caustic violation. The results of Amara et al.\n(2004) were also confirmed in a recent work by Macci\u00f2 et\nal. (2005). In the later work, in which a fully hydrodynamical simulation of galaxy formation is used, it is shown that\nthe presence of a dissipative component greatly enhances\nthe surviving probability of satellites, expecially close to the\ncenter of the galaxy. Nevertheless Macci\u00f2 et al. (2005) also\ndemonstrated that the impact on lensing of subhaloes in the\nmass range 107 \u22121010 M\u2299 is very small. Even with a number\nof subhaloes about 8 higher of the observed one in this mass\nrange, the number of multiple lensed QSOs that show a violation of the cups relation is less than 24%, in contrast with\nan observed one of about 60%. This means that if the violation of the cusp relation is due to substructures inside the\nprimary lens, these must have a mass smaller than 107 M\u2299 .\nThe aim of this work is to study the influence of subhaloes with mass 105 \u2212107 M\u2299 on the cusp relation violation.\nThe outline of the paper is the following: first we briefly\nsummarize the cusp relation, then in section 3 we present the\nlensing numerical simulations and our modeling for the primary lens, subhaloes and extra-haloes. Tests for our models\nand results for three different cusp configurations are presented in section 4. Section 5 is devoted to a short discussion\non the fold relation. A discussion of the results and our conclusions are presented in section 6. Throughout this paper\nthe single large halo that is causing the QSO multiple images\nis referred to as the primary lens. The additional small scale\nhaloes (inside the host halo) are referred to as subhaloes or\nsubstructures. Haloes beyond the virial radius of the primary lens are referred to as extragalactic haloes. We adopt\nthe standard \u039bCDM cosmological model with the following\nparameters \u03a9m = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, \u03c38 = 0.9 and Ho = 70 km\ns\u22121 Mpc\u22121 .\n\n2\n\nTHE CUSP RELATION\n\nThere are basically three configurations of four-image systems: fold, cusp, and cross (Schneider & Weiss 1992). In this\npaper we will mainly concentrate on the cusp configuration,\nthat corresponds to a source located close to the cusp of the\ninner caustic curve. The behavior of gravitational lens mapping near a cusp was first studied by Blandford & Narayan\n(1986), Schneider & Weiss (1992), Mao (1992) and Zakharov\n(1995), who investigated the magnification properties of the\ncusp images and concluded that the sum of the signed magnification factors of the three merging images approaches\nzero as the source moves towards the cusp. In other words\n(e.g. Zakharov 1995) :\nRcusp =\n\n\u03bcA + \u03bcB + \u03bcC\n\u2192 0, f or\n|\u03bcA | + |\u03bcB | + |\u03bcC |\n\n\u03bctot \u2192 \u221e\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03bctot is the unsigned sum of magnifications of all four\nimages, and A,B & C are the triplet of images forming the\nsmallest opening angle (see figure 7). By opening angle, we\nmean the angle measured from the galaxy center and being\nspanned by two images of equal parity. The third image lies\n\ninside such an angle. This relation is an asymptotic relation\nand holds when the source approaches the cusp from inside\nthe inner caustic \"astroid\". This can be shown by expanding\nthe lensing map to third order in the angular separation from\na cusp (Schneider & Weiss 1992). Small scale structure on\nscales smaller than the image separation will cause Rcusp to\ndiffer from zero fairly independently of the form of the rest\nof the lens. Indeed, a substructure is more likely to reduce\nthe absolute magnification for negative magnification images\n(Metcalf & Madau 2001, Schechter & Wambsganss 2002,\nKeeton et al. 2003) and to increase it for positive parity\nimages.\n\n3\n\nLENSING SIMULATIONS\n\nWe use the lensmodel package (Keeton 2001)\u2020 modeling the\nmain lens galaxy as a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE)\nand the substructures as NFW (Navarro, Frenk & White\n1997) haloes. First, using the gravlens task, we find three\nlens configurations for which the cusp relation is roughly\nsatisfied (figures 7, 10 and 16).\nAs second step a variable number of substructures is\nadded to the main lens (see section 3.2 for details on their\nnumber density and physical properties). For this new lensing system (main lens plus subhaloes) we compute again\npositions and fluxes of the images (subhaloes mainly tend\nto modify fluxes more than positions, see Kochanek (2004)\nand section 4.1), obtaining a new value for the cusp relation\nRcusp . This procedure is repeated more than 20.000 times\nfor each of three studied positions of the source (figures 7,\n10 and 16): this allows us to compute the probability distribution of the Rcusp value in presence of subhaloes (i.e. figure\n8).\n\n3.1\n\nPrimary Lens\n\nThe observed discrepancy in the flux ratios, compared with\nthe expected universal relation from a cusp or fold singularity, suggests that it is an intrinsic difficulty for smooth lens\nmodels, not associated with a particular parameterization.\nFor the scope of this paper it is sufficient to choose just a\nsingle smooth lens model for the primary lens. Therefore,\nwe select, as a smooth lens model, a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) (Kormann, Schneider, & Bartelmann 1994) to\ntake advantage of its simplicity. This model has been widely\nused in lens modeling and successfully reproduces many lens\nsystems (e.g. Keeton et al. 1998, Chiba 2002, Treu & Koopmans 2004). An isothermal profile for the total mass distribution of elliptical galaxies is well supported by the detailed\ndynamical studies of local ellipticals (Gerhard et al. 2001),\nindividual lens modeling, and statistics (e.g. Maoz & Rix\n1993; Kochanek 1995; Grogin & Narayan 1996).\nThe ellipsoidal primary lens has a mass equal to 5 \u00d7\n1011 M\u2299 , it is oriented with the major axis along the y axis\nin the lens plane and has an ellipticity of 0.33. The redshifts\nof the lens and he source are fixed to zl = 0.3 and zs = 1.71\n\n\u2020 The software is public available via web site: http://cfawww.harvard.edu/castles\nc 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fThe effect of low mass substructures on the Cusp lensing relation\n\n3\n\nrespectively, agreement with the typical observed ones (in\nthis case we use PG1115+080 data, see Tonry 1998)\n3.2\n\nSubhaloes\n\nSince it has been shown that the number density of subhaloes with mass M > 107 M\u2299 is not sufficient to explain the\nobserved number of violation in the cusp relation (Amara et\nal. 2004, Macci\u00f2 et al. 2005), the aim of this work is to investigate the impact of substructures below this mass threshold\nthat is fixed by the current resolution limits of numerical\nsimulations.\nWe would like to emphasize that we are using only one\nlensing plane, this means that we will consider only effects\ndue to substructures being at the same redshift of the main\nlens (see Chen, Kravtsov & Keeton 2003, Metcalf 2005 for\nan estimation of the effects of haloes along the line of sight).\nIn order to evaluate the number density substructures in the\nmass range 105 \u2212 107 M\u2299 we have made some extrapolations\nbased on results from high resolution N-body simulations.\nThe mass function of subhaloes inside the virial radius of an\nhalo is close to a power law (Diemand et al. 2004, DMS04\nhereafter, Gao et al. 2004, Reed et al. 2005):\nN (> m) \u221d m\u2212\u03b2 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwith a slope \u03b2 \u2248 1, so that we expect to have a factor \u2248 100\nmore subhaloes inside the viral radius if we move our mass\nthreshold from 107 M\u2299 to 105 M\u2299 .\nAs said in the previous section such small haloes will affect the Rcusp relation only if their distance from the images\nis of the same order or smaller than the distance between\nthe images themselves. Therefore we need an estimation of\nthe number of haloes inside a small area surrounding the\nimages. This number will also depend on the distance of our\narea from the center, due to the fact that the number density of haloes increases approaching the center of the main\nhalo (primary lens) as clearly shown in fig 1, which is based\non numerical simulations of 4 galaxy size haloes (DMS04).\nConsequently the number of subhaloes with a mass\ngreater than m inside an area A at a distance R from the\ncenter of the galaxy is:\nNA (> m, R) =\n\n0\nhNrv (> m0 )i m\nN (R)A\nm\n,\n\u03c0rv2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere hNrv (> m0 )i is the average number density of subhaloes with m > m0 (being m0 an arbitrary mass value)\ninside the virial radius rv and N (R) is the radial 2D number density of satellites at a projected distance R from the\ncenter in units of hNrv (> m0 )i (see figure 1). These last\ntwo quantities can be obtained directly from N-body simulations. In the following we will use results from DMS04 (table\n1 of their paper, simulations G0-G3). Macci\u00f2 et al. (2005)\nhave shown that the presence of baryons inside subhaloes\nenhance the probability to find haloes close to the center of\nthe galaxy with respect to results from dissipationless simulations. This is true for satellites with m > 5\u00d7107 M\u2299 , which\nare massive enough to retain baryons inside their potential\nwell and then form stars. Since we do not expect such effect\nfor the mass scales involved in this work (\u2248 105 \u2212 106 M\u2299 )\nwe can use pure N-body simulation as starting point for our\nanalysis.\nSince the typical separation between images in lensed\nc 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nFigure 1. Two dimensional radial number density of subhaloes\nin units of the average number density inside the virial radius.\nResult obtained averaging the 4 high resolution galaxies presented\nin DMS04, using three different projections for each galaxy.\n\nQSOs is roughly a few arcsec, we fix R \u2248 1 arcsec and A = 6\narcsec2 (A6 hereafter). We remind that at a redshift of zl =\n0.3 one arcsec corresponds to 4.55 kpc for the cosmological\nmodel adopted in this paper. Using eq. 3 and adopting a\nmass threshold for substructures of m = 5 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 the\nnumber of subhaloes inside A ranges from 4 to 12 (depending\non the uncertainties on N (R), see figure 1). For two 107 M\u2299\nhaloes the surface mass density within the selected area A\nis 0.69h\u22122 M\u2299 pc\u22122 , this means a fraction \u2248 10\u22123 of the\ntotal dark matter surface density in substructures, in good\nagreement with the results of Mao et al 2004.\nFor each lensing configuration analyzed in this work we\nadded a random number of substructures between 4 \u2212 12 to\nthe primary lens with a random mass generated according to\neq. 2 in the range 5\u00d7105 \u2212107 M\u2299 . These subhaloes are then\nplaced following the 2D density profile inside the area A6\nthat encloses the three images (cfr the (blue) square in figure\n7). We have modeled our subhaloes with an NFW (Navarro,\nFrenk & White 1997) density profile; for the \u2248 106 M\u2299 subhaloes relevant for lensing substructure studied in this work,\nthe NFW profile inferred from N-body simulation is the\nmost natural choice, because on these mass scales the effect of baryons (that are able to modify the slope of the\ndensity profile for greater masses (Macci\u00f2 et al. 2005)) is\nvery tiny because the potential well of these haloes is not\ndeep enough to retain them expecially in presence of a ionizing background. We have adopted different concentration\nparameters (see sec. 4.1) to mimic the scatter present in the\nmass-concentration relation (Bullock et al. 2001).\n3.3\n\nExtrahaloes\n\nLensing galaxies are not isolated object, since they usually\nbelong to group of galaxies (Keeton et al. 2000). Moreover\neach galaxy has its own satellites galaxies with masses in\n\n\f4\n\nAndrea V. Macci\u00f2 & Marco Miranda\n\nthe range 109 \u2212 1011 M\u2299 . Consequently we have modeled the\npresence of these extrahaloes in the same way of the innerhaloes. In this work we call substructures or innerhaloes,\nhaloes with mass < 107 M\u2299 that are close to the image\nposition; we reserve the term extrahaloes for haloes with\nM > 109 M\u2299 . We do not consider extrahaloes that for projection effects can lie inside the primary lens close to the\nimages positions (i.e. Oguri 2005).\nWe considered three different categories of extrahaloes:\ni) haloes with mass 109 < M < 1010 M\u2299 and with a projected distance r between 60 and 200 kpc, these represent the satellites galaxy of the primary lens (the expected\nnumber for these haloes can be estimated again form Nbody simulation and it is roughly 6-8); ii) haloes with mass\n1011 < M < 1012 M\u2299 and distance 300 < r < 700 kpc in order to mimic the presence of companion galaxies; iii) haloes\nwith 1012 < M < 5 \u00d7 1013 M\u2299 and 700 < r < 1200 kpc to\ntake into account the possible presence of a nearby cluster\nof galaxies.\nThe number of extrahaloes has been fixed between 2-8\nand 2-4 for the ii) and iii) case respectively, as suggested\nby observations/simulations (Metcalf 2005, Amara 2004).\nWhile the extrahaloes in case i) are placed in a circularly\nsymmetric way around the center of the galaxy, the position of groups and clusters of galaxies must be modeled in\nan asymmetric way. Therefore we placed them only in the\nquadrant with positive coordinates in the lens plane (being\nthe lens in [0 : 0]). We used SIE as lens model for extrahaloes\nto take into account the presence of baryons their-inside and\nwe have generated 20.000 different configurations.\n\n4\n\nRESULTS\n\nIn this section we present results of our Monte Carlo simulations. We have analyzed 3 cusp configurations: Config1\n(figure 7), Config2 (figure 10) and Config3 (figure16). They\nmainly differ for the value of Rcusp in the unperturbed case\nthat grows from 0.01 for Config1 to 0.243 for Config3, due\nto a different position of the source inside the inner caustic\ncurve.\n4.1\n\nTesting our model\n\nBefore proceeding further in our analysis we present some\ntests on the parameter adopted in our lensing simulation.\nThe presence of substructures acts both on positions and\nfluxes of the images. When a substructure is added the\ngravlens code adjusts the positions and fluxes of the images\nby minimizing the \u03c72 between the old (unperturbed) and\nnew (perturbed) positions/fluxes. The value of \u03c72 depends\non the error that we assign to the unperturbed positions\nand fluxes (usually these are the observational errors); this\nmeans that if the error on positions is smaller than the error on fluxes the code will change the latter ones more than\nmoving the images to obtain a lower value for \u03c72 .\nTherefore in principle the value of the perturbed Rcusp\nis influenced by the error assigned to the position of the\nimages. In figure 2 we clearly show that this effect is very\nsmall even for a big variation of the image position errors.\nThis plot illustrates the probability distribution for Rcusp\n(obtained using 20.000 realizations) when 4 substructures\n\nFigure 2. Probability distribution of Rcusp values for 2 substructures inside A3 for different position errors.\n\nare added to the primary lens : the solid line is for an error\non positions of \u01eb1 = 10\u22122 arcsec (\u2248 5%) the dashed one for\n\u01eb2 = 103 arcsec (i.e. the code has complete freedom in moving the images). The two distributions of the Rcusp values\nare very similar, and this also confirms findings of other authors: the influence of substructures on the image positions\nis less strong than the one on fluxes (Kochanek 2004). We\nwill adopt 10\u22122 arcsec for the error on positions for all our\nsimulations.\nA correct determination of the subhaloes properties (see\nsection 3.2) is a key ingredient in computing the Rcusp value:\nfigure 3 shows the influence of the number density and mass\nrange of substructures on the Rcusp relation. Both changing\nthe area in which subhaloes are distributed (keeping fixed\ntheir number: left panel) or their mass range (right panel)\nleads to complete different results.\nAs second step we have tested if the subhaloes that\nlive outside the small area (A) surrounding the images can\nsubstantially modify the Rcusp relation. For this purpose\nwe have defined three different areas for substructures for\nConfig2: A3 = [\u22121.5 : 1.5] \u00d7 [1 : 2], A6 = [\u22121.5 : 1.5] \u00d7 [0 : 2]\nand A12 = [\u22121.75 : 1.75] \u00d7 [\u22121.25 : 2.25]. The last one (A12 )\nis big enough to cover all the image positions. Changing the\nsize of the area and his position in respect to the center\nof the lens, the number of substructures changes according\nto eq: 3. The number of subhaloes inside the three areas is\n4, 9 and 19 respectively. Figure 4 shows our results. The\nRcusp probability distribution is weakly affected by the size\nof the area. This indicates that are the subhaloes close to the\nimage positions the ones responsible for the Rcusp relation\nmodification.\nFigure 5 shows results for Config2 (figure 10) of the\nRcusp probability distribution for 3 subhaloes with mass\n5 \u00d7 105 < m < 107 M\u2299 inside A3 (solid line) and for 8 subhaloes with 107 < m < 109 M\u2299 inside an area of 57 arcsec2\n([\u22125 : 5] \u00d7 [0 : 6] with the exclusion of A3 ).

As expected denser haloes\nhave a stronger impact on the Rcusp relation. We have also\nconsidered two other mass profiles for the subhaloes: SIS\n(singular isothermal sphere) and point like approximation.\nThe first one, less favored by simulations, can be seen as\nan upper limit for the NFW profile, due to the fact that\nits inner slope for the density profile is proportional to r \u22122 .\nFor this kind of subhalo model the Rcusp probability is just\nslightly above the ones for NFW haloes with c=35, so we do\nnot expect a big change in our results using SIS instead of\nNFW subhaloes. On the other hand the point mass approximation leads to an underestimate of the effect of subhaloes\non Rcusp since for a fixed mass a point-like object has a\nsmaller Einstein radius than an NFW halo (Keeton 2003).\nIn the following we have adopted a concentration parameter\nof 35 for our subhaloes in order to try to maximize their\neffect on the Rcusp relation.\nFigure 4. Probability distribution of Rcusp for substructures distributed on different areas.\n\n4.2\n\nthe masses are over estimated by a large fraction. Nevertheless its effect on the cusp relation is very small and the Rcusp\nprobability distribution is close to a delta function centered\non the unperturbed value.\nModeling our subhaloes as NFW structures we have one\nmore free parameter: the concentration. It is well know that\nthe concentration correlates with the mass of the halo, even\nif a consistent scatter is present in this relation. Extrapolating results from Bullock et al 2001, the mean concentration\nin our mass range is around 33.

The\ncritical and caustic curves refer to the unperturbed case but\nthey are not different from perturbed ones at the level of\nresolution.\nFor this configuration we have generated 20.000 different lensing systems that include substructures according\nto eq: 3. In figure 8 is shown the probability distribution\nfor Rcusp for different numbers of substructures. The maximum of the probability is obtained for the unperturbed\nvalue (0.01) and the tail of the distribution extends to\n\nc 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nConfiguration 1\n\n\f6\n\nAndrea V.

Figure 9 shows in a logarithmic plot the\ntail of the distribution presented in figure 8: it is possible\nto note that an increase of the total number of substructures (from 4 to 6) does not substantially change the value\nof Rcusp .\nFrom figure 8 one see that in the 10% of the configurations the final value of Rcusp is even less than the unperturbed value and it is closer to the theoretical expectation\nof Rcusp = 0 (see next section on the second configuration\nfor more details).\n\nConfiguration 2\n\nIn this configuration (Config2 hereafter) the source is close\nto the upper cusp of the inner caustic curve (see fig 10) with\nan unperturbed value of Rcusp = 0.09.\nFigure 11 shows the analogous of figure 8 for Config2\nand figure 12 shows the tail of the distribution for large\nvalues of Rcusp . Even in this case the maximum of the probability distribution is centered on the unperturbed value.\nHere the distribution of the values of Rcusp is more symmetric than for Config1 and it is more evident that the effect of\nsubstructures not only increase the value of the cusp ratio\nbut can also reduce it.\nc 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fThe effect of low mass substructures on the Cusp lensing relation\n\n7\n\nFigure 10.

One perturbed configuration where Rcusp is less than\nthe unperturbed value (0.091 vs 0.07). The solid circles show the\nposition of the subhaloes, the point size is proportional to their\nmass.\n\nTo better illustrate this effect we have isolated one of the\nconfigurations in which we find a reduction of Rcusp (figure\n13). When the distribution of subhaloes is non symmetric in\nrespect to the triplets of images and one of the perturbers is\nclose to one of the external images the latter image results\nto be more magnified than the others. In the unperturbed\nconfiguration |\u03bc(B)| > \u03bc(A) + \u03bc(C) and this causes Rcusp 6=\n0. On the other hand if the perturbers increase \u03bc(A) without\nchanging considerably the magnification of the other images,\nthis will enhance the sum \u03bc(A) + \u03bc(C) pushing it closer to\n\u03bc(B), giving a smaller Rcusp (0.07 in the case of figure 13).\nFigure 14 shows the effects of extra haloes on the Rcusp\nc 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nvalue for Config2. For all the three extra-haloes mass ranges\nconsidered, the modifications in the cusp relation are very\nsmall and the value of Rcusp is not very sensitive to the total\nnumber of extra-haloes we generated (results for different\nnumber of subhaloes are shown by different curves, which\nare almost overlapping in the various panels).\nFor this configuration we have performed one more test:\nwe have modified by hand the fluxes of the three images in\norder to obtain an high value of Rcusp (> 0.37).

We have found two configurations for subhaloes that are shown in figure 15. In the\nfirst case (solid squares) the mass of the substructures is\nroughly the same (\u2248 2.0 \u00d7 106 ), they are close to the external images with a distance of 0.08 arcsec and the perturbed\nvalue of Rcusp is 0.387. In the second case (open circles) the\nmass of the subhalo close to the central image is 1.6\u00d7105 M\u2299\nwith a distance of 0.06 arcsec, while 7.8\u00d7105 M\u2299 is the mass\nof the second one that is far away from the central image,\nfor a perturbed value of Rcusp equal to 0.372.\nThe aim of this test is to show that there is nearly\nalways the possibility to explain an anomalous flux ratio using subhaloes, but that their positions and masses must be\ntuned in a very precise way (i.e distances between images\nand subhaloes must be less than 0.08 arcsec). Most important, our Monte Carlo simulations show that the probability\nof obtaining such a fine tuning is very low. As a consequence\nwe conclude that an explanation for the high number of observed anomalous flux ratios in lensed QSOs based on the\npresence of subhaloes in the mass range we have tested is\nvery unlikely.\n\n4.4\n\nFigure 15.

Figure 17 shows the R-cusp\nprobability distribution for Config2 and Config3 normalized\nto the unperturbed value. There are no appreciable differences between the two configurations. The probability distributions have almost the same width and the same maximum value (\u2248 0.35) and both are centered on the respective\nunperturbed value. This means that the ability of substruc-\n\ntures to modify the Rcusp relation is nearly independent on\nthe original value of the cusp ratio.\n\n5\n\nFOLD RELATION\n\nFor sake of completeness we have also considered a fold\ncase similar to the configuration of the well known system\nPG1115 (Impey et al. 1998). In this case we define the fold\nc 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fThe effect of low mass substructures on the Cusp lensing relation\n\n9\n\nA2\nA1\n\nFigure 17.

In\nour computational procedure the position of the source can\nbe changed by the gravlens code, in order to minimize the \u03c72\nof the lens configuration. While this does not affect the Rcusp\nrelation it can be important in the fold case: as pointed out\nby Keeton, Gaudi and Petters (2005) the degree to which\nRf old can differ from one for realistic smooth lenses depends,\nin addition to the angular structure of the lens potential, not\nonly on the distance of the source from the caustic but also\non its location along the caustic itself. So the the values we\ngot for Rf old are due both to the effects of subhaloes and\nboth to the shift along the caustics of the source.\nThus, it is not possible to conclude from Rfold alone\nwhether observed flux ratios are anomalous or not.\n\n6\n\nDISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS\n\nQuasars that are being gravitationally lensed into multiple\nimages have recently been used to place limits on the surface density of cold dark matter subhaloes (Mao & Schneider 1998, Metcalf & Madau 2001, Chiba 2002, Metcalf\n& Zhao 2002, Dalal & Kochanek 2002, Chen Kravtsov &\nKeeton 2003, Bradac et al. 2004, Mao et al. 2004). Small\nmass clumps that happen to lie near the images affect the\nobserved magnification ratios. The question arises as to\nwhether these observations are compatible with distortions\nexpected to occur from dark matter substructures and satellite galaxies within the \u039bCDM model. Recent results based\non numerical N-body (Amara et al. 2004, Rozo et al. 2005)\nc 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nFigure 19. Probability distribution of Rf old for a different number of substructures within an area of 3 arcsec2 (5\u00d7105 < Msub <\n107 M\u2299 ).\n\nand hydro simulations (Macci\u00f2 et al. 2005) have shown that\nit is hard to reconcile the observed high number of cups relation violation with the total amount of substructures predicted by the \u039bCDMmodel. These studies were limited by\nthe present achievable numerical resolution that permits to\nresolve DM haloes down to masses \u2248 107 M\u2299 .\nIn this work we have quantified the effects of smaller\nmass clumps (105 \u2212 107 M\u2299 ) on the observed violation of the\nR cusp relation. We employed results from N-body simulations to estimate the expected number of subhaloes in this\nlow mass range. Due to the small mass of the perturbers\n\n\f10\n\nAndrea V. Macci\u00f2 & Marco Miranda\n\nwe have restricted our analysis only to those close (in 2D)\nto the images positions. For the mass range inspected in\nthis work and for the typical distance between images (few\narcsecs) this leads to a number of perturbers \u2248 6. All the\nsubhaloes are modeled as NFW spheres and we have generated more than 105 different lensing configurations, varying\nmasses, positions and number of subhaloes.\nThe main finding of our work is that on a statistical basis this class of perturbers is not able to modify consistently\nthe unperturbed R-cusp relation. Values of Rcusp in the observed range (\u2248 0.25) are obtained in only less than 1% of\nthe analyzed systems. The ability of subhaloes in modifying\nthe unperturbed value of Rcusp is found to be independent\nfrom the value of Rcusp itself.\nThese results are not in contradiction with the ones in\nthe literature (Keeton et al. 2003, and more recently Miranda & Jetzer 2005 and references therein). As shown in\nfigure 15 it is possible to use subhaloes in the mass range\n105 \u2212 107 M\u2299 to obtain high values of Rcusp case by case, but\na tight fine tuning between the location of the images and\nmasses/positions of the perturbers is needed .\nIn addition, we have also considered the impact of massive haloes placed outside the primary lens (from groups of\ngalaxies to a close cluster) by modeling them in the same\nway of the subhaloes. Our simulations show, as expected,\nthat their contribution in modifying the R cusp relation is\ntiny and almost negligible with respect to the effect of subhaloes.\nResults from this work together with results from numerical simulations seem to be in disagreement with the\nstandard picture which explains the anomalous flux ratio\nby means of dark matter satellites. Interestingly, while on\ndwarf galaxy scale there is an excess of dark matter subhaloes with respect to visible satellites, we have shown that\nthe predicted level of substructures on smaller scales is not\nsufficient to explain the observed level of violation in the\ncusp relation.\nPossible solutions to this problem can reside in microlensing for some of the lensing systems observed in the\noptical band (Metcalf 2005, Keeton et al 2005), or in the\npresence of haloes lying along the line of sight between the\nlens and the observer (Chen et al. 2003, Metcalf 2005), although total effect of this kind of perturbers is not yet clear.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Chuck Keeton for making available the gravlens\nsoftware and for his comments on an early version of this\nwork.
