Introduction\nSupergiant Fast X-ray transients (SFXTs) are a new class of high mass X-ray binaries (HMXB),\nrecently discovered with INTEGRAL. These sources are observed to exhibit sporadic outbursts,\nlasting from minutes to hours, with peak X-ray luminosities between \u223c1036 and 1037 erg s\u22121\n(Sguera et al., 2005). No firm orbital period measurement has been obtained yet1 . A recent list\nof confirmed (\u223c5) and candidate (\u223c6) SFXTs is given by Walter & Zurita Heras (2007). Between outbursts, SFXTs remain in quiescence with luminosities in the range \u223c1031 -1033 erg s\u22121 .\nIn some cases, very high peak-to-quiescence X-ray luminosity swings (factor of \u223c104 -105 ) were\nseen on timescales comparable to the outburst duration. Some SFXTs showed also flare-like activity at intermediate luminosity levels (e.g., In't Zand, 2005). Optical identifications of SFXTs\nshow that these sources are associated to OB supergiant companion stars (see e.g., Walter & Zurita Heras, 2007, and reference therein). These stars have typically a mass of M\u2217 \u223c30M\u2299 , optical luminosity of log (L\u2217 /L\u2299 )\u223c5-6, mass loss rate of \u1e40w =10\u22127 -10\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , wind velocity of\nvw \u223c1000-2000 km s\u22121 , and are persistent soft X-ray sources with luminosity around \u223c1032 erg s\u22121\n(Cassinelli et al., 1981).\nIt is widely believed that SFXTs contain neutron stars (NS) sporadically accreting matter from\na supergiant companion, and in the prototypical SFXTs XTE J1739-302 (Sguera et al., 2006) and\nIGR J16479-4514 (Walter et al., 2006) some evidence has been reported for spin periods in the\n\u223c1000-2000 s range. Proposed models for SFXTs generally involve accretion onto a NS immersed\nin the clumpy wind of its supergiant companion (In't Zand, 2005; Walter & Zurita Heras, 2007).\nHowever, if accretion onto the collapsed object of SFXTs takes place both in quiescence and outburst, then the corresponding X-ray luminosity swing, typically a factor of \u223c104 -105 , would require\nwind inhomogeneities with a very large density and/or velocity contrast (according to the standard\n1 Only\n\nIGR J11215-5952 showed recurrent flaring activity, with a periodicity of \u223c165 d. This is interpreted as\noutbursts from a systems with an unusually long orbital period (Sidoli et al., 2007). Thus Walter & Zurita Heras (2007)\nexcluded these sources from their SFXT list.\n\n2\n\n\fMagnetars and SFXTs\n\nSuperkeplerian magnetic\ninhibition regime\n\nE.

All the regimes\ndescribed in the text are shown, together with the relative position of the magnetospheric radius (solid line), the corotation radius (dashed\nline), and the accretion radius (dotted line). A wavy solid line is used when the magnetospheric boundary at the magnetospheric radius\nis Kelvin-Helmholtz unstable. In the supersonic and subsonic propeller regime convective motions at the base of the atmosphere are\nrepresented with small eddies.\n\nwind accretion, the mass capture rate onto the NS scales like \u1e40w v\u22124\nw Davidson & Ostriker, 1979).\nModels involving accretion of extremely dense clumps are still being actively pursued (Negueruela\net al., 2008). The requirement on the density and/or velocity contrasts in the wind can be eased\nif there is a barrier that remains closed during quiescence, halting most of the accretion flow, and\nopens up in outbursts, leading to direct accretion. After reviewing briefly the theory of wind accretion in HMXBs (\u00a7 2 and 3), we apply barrier scenarios to SFXTs in \u00a7 4 and conclude that if SFXTs\nhost slowly rotating NSs (spin periods of several hundreds to thousands seconds), then they must\npossess magnetar-like fields (\u223c1014 -1015 G).\n\n2. Stellar wind accretion\nWe investigate here the conditions under which a magnetized NS can accrete matter from the\nwind of a massive companion. In the theory of wind accretion in HMXBs, the following radii are\ndefined (e.g., Illarionov & Sunyaev, 1975; Stella et al., 1986):\n- The accretion radius, Ra is the distance at which the inflowing matter is gravitationally focused\ntoward the NS. It is usually expressed as\nRa = 2GMNS /v2w = 3.7 \u00d7 1010 v\u22122\n8 cm,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere v8 is the wind velocity in units of 1000 km s\u22121 and we assumed that the orbital velocity of\nthe star is negligible (Frank et al., 2002). Throughout the paper we fix the NS radius and mass at\nRNS =106 cm and MNS =1.4 M\u2299 , respectively. The fraction \u1e40capt /\u1e40w of the stellar wind mass loss\nrate (\u1e40w ) captured by the NS depends on Ra through (Frank et al., 2002)\n\u22122\n\u1e40capt /\u1e40w \u2243 R2a /(4a2 ) = 2 \u00d7 10\u22125 v\u22124\n8 a10d .\n2/3\n\n1/3\n\n(2.2)\n\nHere a=4.2\u00d71012 a10d cm is the orbital separation, a10d =P10d M30 , P10d is the binary orbital period\nin units of 10 days, and M30 is the total mass of the binary in units of 30 M\u2299 (we assumed circular\norbits).\n- The magnetospheric radius, RM , at which the pressure of the NS magnetic field (\u03bc 2 /(8\u03c0 R6NS ),\n3\n\n\fMagnetars and SFXTs\n\nE. Bozzo\n\nwith \u03bc the NS magnetic moment) balances the ram pressure of the inflowing matter (\u03c1w v2w ). In the\ncase in which RM >Ra , the magnetospheric radius is given by (Davies & Pringle, 1981)\n\u22121/6 \u22121/6 1/3 1/3\na10d \u03bc33\n\nRM = 3.3 \u00d7 1010 \u1e40\u22126 v8\n\ncm.\n\n(2.3)\n\nHere we assumed a non-magnetized spherically symmetric wind (Elsner & Lamb, 1977), with\ndensity2 \u03c1w (RM )\u223c\u1e40w /(4\u03c0 a2 vw ), a NS dipolar field with \u03bc33 =\u03bc /1033 G cm3 , and \u1e40\u22126 =\u1e40w /10\u22126\nM\u2299 yr\u22121 . In the following sections we discuss the range of applicability of Eq. 2.3, and the regimes\nin which a different prescription for RM should be used.\n- The corotation radius, Rco , at which the NS angular velocity equals the Keplerian angular velocity, i.e.\n2/3\n(2.4)\nRco = 1.7 \u00d7 1010 Ps3 cm.\nHere Ps3 is the NS spin period in units of 103 s.\nChanges in the relative position of these radii result into transitions across different regimes\nfor the NS (Illarionov & Sunyaev, 1975; Stella et al., 1986). In particular, the accretion radius and\nmagnetospheric radius depend on the wind parameters (see Eqs. 2.1 and 2.3), which can vary on a\nwide range of timescales (from hours to months). Therefore, variations in the wind parameters can\ncause the NS to undergo transitions across different regimes on comparably short timescales, thus\nopening the possibility to explain the properties of some classes of highly variable X-ray sources\nthrough them. Below we summarise the different regimes of a magnetic rotating NS, subject to a\nvarying stellar wind.\n- Outside the accretion radius: the magnetic inhibition of accretion (RM >Ra ). In systems with RM >Ra the mass flow from the companion star interacts directly with the NS magnetosphere without significant gravitational focusing, forming a bow shock at RM (Harding et al., 1992;\nToropina et al., 2006). At least in the front part of the shock, i.e. in the region around the stagnation\npoint, the whole kinetic energy of the inflowing matter is converted into thermal energy. The power\nreleased in this region is of order\nLshock \u2243\n\n\u03c0 2\n\u22121\nR \u03c1w v3w = 4.7 \u00d7 1029 R2M10 v28 a\u22122\n10d \u1e40\u22126 erg s\n2 M\n\n(2.5)\n\n(RM10 =RM /1010 cm), and is mainly radiated in the X-ray band. We distinguish two different\nregimes of magnetic inhibition of accretion:\n\u2022 The superKeplerian magnetic inhibition regime: RM >Ra , Rco . In this case the magnetospheric radius is larger than both the accretion and corotation radii. Matter that is shocked\nand halted close to RM cannot proceed further inward, due to the rotational drag of the NS\nmagnetosphere which is locally superKeplerian. Since magnetospheric rotation is also supersonic, the interaction between the NS magnetic field and matter at RM results in rotational\nenergy dissipation and thus, NS spin down. This process releases energy at a rate\n\u22122\n\u22121\nLsd \u2243 \u03c0 R2M \u03c1w vw (RM \u03a9)2 \u2243 3.7 \u00d7 1029 R4M10 \u1e40\u22126 a\u22122\n10d Ps3 erg s ,\n\nwhich adds to the shock luminosity (Eq. 2.5).\n2 We\n\napproximated a-RM \u2243a , which is satisfied for a very wide range of parameters.\n\n4\n\n(2.6)\n\n\fMagnetars and SFXTs\n\nE. Bozzo\n\n\u2022 The subKeplerian magnetic inhibition regime: Ra <RM <Rco . In this case the magnetospheric drag is subKeplerian and matter can penetrate the NS magnetosphere through KelvinHelmholtz instabilities (KHI, Harding et al., 1992) and Bohm diffusion (Ikhsanov & Pustil'nik,\n1996). The mass inflow rate across RM resulting from the KHI depends on the efficiency factor \u03b7KH \u223c0.1, the shear velocity at RM vsh , and the densities \u03c1i and \u03c1e inside and outside the\nmagnetospheric boundary at RM , respectively. The luminosity released by accretion of this\nmatter onto the NS is given by\n1/2\nLKH = 3.5 \u00d7 1034 \u03b7KH R2M10 a\u22122\n(1 + \u03c1i /\u03c1e )\u22121 erg s\u22121 ,\n10d \u1e40\u22126 (\u03c1i /\u03c1e )\n\n(2.7)\n\n\u22121\n\u22121 3\n1/2\nLKH = 8.8 \u00d7 1034 \u03b7KH Ps3\n(1 + \u03c1i /\u03c1e )\u22121 erg s\u22121 ,\nRM10 a\u22122\n10d v8 \u1e40\u22126 (\u03c1i /\u03c1e )\n\n(2.8)\n\nor\n\nif the shear velocity is taken to be the gas velocity in the post-shock region close to RM or\nthe rotational velocity of the NS magnetosphere, respectively (for simplicity, we consider\nthroughout this paper LKH equal to the largest of the above two values). The ratio \u03c1i /\u03c1e can\nbe calculated from the equation of the mass conservation across the KHI unstable layer, i.e.\nR2M \u03c1e vconv \u2243 RM ht \u03c1i vff (RM ),\n\n(2.9)\n\nwhere ht is the height of the unstable layer (Burnard et al., 1983). Throughout this paper we\nassume ht =RM (Bozzo et al., 2008). The contribution of Bohm diffusion to the total mass\ninflow rate through the magnetosphere in the subKeplerian magnetic inhibition regime can\nbe calculated according to Ikhsanov & Pustil'nik (1996), and we found that it is orders of\nmagnitude smaller than that due to the KHI over the whole range of parameters relevant to\nthis work. Similarly, the contribution to the total luminosity resulting from the shock at the\nmagnetospheric boundary can be neglected in this regime.\n- Inside the accretion radius: RM <Ra . Once RM is inside the accretion radius, matter flowing\nfrom the companion star is shocked adiabatically at Ra (this produces an almost negligible contribution to the total luminosity) and halted at the NS magnetosphere. In the region between Ra and\nRM this matter redistributes itself into an approximately spherical configuration (resembling an\n\"atmosphere\"), whose shape and properties are determined by the interaction between matter and\nNS magnetic field at RM (Davies et al., 1979; Davies & Pringle, 1981). A hydrostatic equilibrium\nensues when radiative losses inside Ra are negligible3 ; the atmosphere is stationary on dynamical\ntimescales, and a polytropic law of the form p\u221d\u03c1 1+1/n can be assumed for the pressure and density of the atmosphere. The value of the polytropic index n depends on the conditions at the inner\nboundary of the atmosphere, and in particular on the rate at which energy is deposited there. Three\ndifferent regimes can be distinguished:\n\u2022 The supersonic propeller regime: Rco <RM <Ra . In this case the rotational velocity of the NS\nmagnetosphere at RM is supersonic; the interaction with matter in the atmosphere leads to\ndissipation of some of the star's rotational energy and thus spin-down. Turbulent motions are\n3 We\n\nchecked this is verified for all the case of interest for this paper.\n\n5\n\n\fMagnetars and SFXTs\n\nE.

According to Davies &\nPringle (1981), this gives the largest contribution to the total luminosity in this regime\nLsd = 2\u03c0 R2M \u03c1 (RM )c3s (RM ) \u2243\n1/2\n\n1/2\n\u22121\nerg s\u22121 .\n5.4 \u00d7 1031 \u1e40\u22126 a\u22122\n10d v8 RM10 (1 + 16Ra10 /(3RM10 ))\n\n(2.11)\n\nIn the above equation Ra10 =10\u221210 Ra and cs (RM )=vff (RM )=(2GMNS /RM )1/2 .\n\u2022 The subsonic propeller regime: RM <Ra , Rco , \u1e40w <\u1e40lim . The break down of the supersonic\npropeller regime occurs when RM <Rco , i.e., when the magnetosphere rotation is no longer\nsupersonic with respect to the surrounding material. The structure of the atmosphere changes\nand the transition to the subsonic propeller regime takes place. Since the rotation of the magnetosphere is subsonic, the atmosphere is roughly adiabatic (n=3/2), and the magnetospheric\nradius is approximated by (Davies & Pringle, 1981):\n4/7\n\n\u22122/7 8/7\n\n4/7\n\nRM \u2243 2 \u00d7 1010 a10d \u1e40\u22126 v8 \u03bc33 cm.\n\n(2.12)\n\nIn the subsonic propeller regime, the centrifugal barrier does not operate because RM <Rco ,\nbut the energy input at the base of the atmosphere (due to NS rotational energy dissipation)\nis still too high for matter to penetrate the magnetosphere at a rate \u1e40capt (Davies & Pringle,\n1981). Nevertheless a fraction of the matter inflow at Ra is expected to accrete onto the NS,\ndue to the KHI and Bohm diffusion4 . We found that, in all the cases of interest to this paper,\nthe KHI provides the largest contribution to the total luminosity in the subsonic propeller\nregime. By using similar arguments to those above, we estimated in this case\nLKH = 1.8 \u00d7 1035 \u03b7KH R3M10 \u1e40\u22126\n\n(1 + 16Ra10 /(5RM10 ))3/2 (\u03c1i /\u03c1e )1/2\nerg s\u22121 .\nPs3 a210d v8 (1 + \u03c1i /\u03c1e )\n\n(2.13)\n\nThe subsonic propeller regime applies until the critical accretion rate\n5/2\n\n\u22123 2\n\u1e40lim\u22126 = 2.8 \u00d7 102 Ps3\na10d v8 RM10 (1 + 16Ra10 /(5RM10 ))\u22123/2\n\n(2.14)\n\nis reached, at which the gas radiative cooling (bremsstralhung) completely damps convective\nmotions inside the atmosphere (Davies & Pringle, 1981). If this cooling takes place, direct\naccretion at a rate \u1e40capt onto the NS surface is permitted.\n\u2022 The direct accretion regime: RM <Ra , Rco , \u1e40w >\u1e40lim . If RM <Rco and matter outside the\nmagnetosphere cools efficiently, accretion onto the NS takes place at the same rate \u1e40capt (see\nEq. 2.2) at which it flows towards the magnetosphere. The corresponding luminosity is\n\u22124\n\u22121\nLacc = GMNS \u1e40capt /RNS = 2 \u00d7 1035 \u1e40\u22126 a\u22122\n\u2243 2 \u00d7 1035 \u1e4015 erg s\u22121 ,\n10d v8 erg s\n\n(2.15)\n\nwhere \u1e4015 =\u1e40capt /1015 g s\u22121 . This is the standard accretion regime; the system achieves the\nhighest mass to luminosity conversion efficiency.\n4 To\n\nour knowledge this is the first application of the KHI to the subsonic propeller regime.\n\n6\n\n\fMagnetars and SFXTs\n\nE.

Transitions and paths across different regimes\nWe explore here the conditions under which transitions across different regimes take place.\nAs emphasised in \u00a7 2, these transitions occur when the relative positions of RM , Ra , and Rco\nchange in response to variations in the stellar wind parameters. In the following, since RM depends\nonly weakly on the orbital period and the total mass of the system, we fix a10d =1, and investigate\nvariations in the other four parameters: \u03bc33 , Ps3 , v8 , and \u1e40\u22126 . The equations that define the\nconditions for transitions between different regimes are\n2 11 2\nRM > Ra \u21d2 \u1e40\u22126 . 0.45\u03bc33\nv8 a10d magnetic barrier;\n\u22121/4 \u22121/4 1/2 1/2\nRM > Rco \u21d2 Ps3 . 2.6\u1e40\u22126 v8 a10d \u03bc33\n2/3 \u22121/3 2/3 2/3\nRM > Rco \u21d2 Ps3 . 1.8a10d \u1e40\u22126 v8 \u03bc33\n\u221215/21 30/21 60/21 16/21\na10d v8\nPs3 & 4.5\u1e40\u22126\n\u03bc33\n\n(3.1)\n\ncentrifugal barrier with RM > Ra ;\n\n(3.2)\n\ncentrifugal barrier with RM < Ra ;\n\n(3.3)\n\nsubsonic propeller \u2192 direct accretion.\n\n(3.4)\n\nAs an example, in Fig. 2A we use the above equations to compute the luminosity swings for a system with \u03bc33 =0.8, Ps3 =1, and v8 =1.2. The lower panel of this figure shows that, for 0.1<\u1e40\u22126 <100,\nthe magnetospheric radius crosses both the centrifugal (Rco ) and magnetic (Ra ) barriers. Correspondingly, the system moves from the superKeplerian magnetic inhibition regime, to the supersonic and subsonic propeller regime, and, finally, to the direct accretion regime, giving rise to a\nsix-decade luminosity swing from \u223c1031 to \u223c1037 erg s\u22121 . We note that a large part of this swing\n(about five decades) is attained across the transitions from the superKeplerian magnetic inhibition\nto the direct accretion regimes, which take a mere factor of \u223c5 variation of \u1e40w .\nFig. 2B shows that, in the presence of a standard NS magnetic field (1012 G), such abrupt luminosity jumps are not expected for a very slowly rotating (1000 s) NS (the other system parameters\nare the same as those of Fig. 2A), since the magnetospheric radius is smaller than both Ra and Rco ,\n7\n\n\fMagnetars and SFXTs\n\nE.

(B) Same as (A) but for \u03bc33 =0.01, Ps3 =0.1, and v8 =2.2.\n\nfor any reasonable value of \u1e40w . Therefore, the direct accretion regime applies, with the luminosity\nproportional to \u1e40w .\nIn Fig. 3 we show the transitions for a system with \u03bc33 =0.01 and Ps3 =0.1. The wind velocity\nis v8 =1.2 in Fig. 3A, and v8 =2.2 in Fig. 3B. These two figures show that, for sub-magnetar fields,\na 100 s spinning NS can undergo a transition across the magnetic barrier (besides the centrifugal\nbarrier), for suitable parameters (a high wind velocity in the case at hand). Such transitions take\nplace over a more extended interval of mass loss rates. For instance Fig. 3B shows that an increase\nby a factor \u223c100 in the mass loss rate is required, in this case, to achieve a factor \u223c105 luminosity\nswing; this is comparable with the magnetar case of Fig. 2A.\nTaking into account of the examples discussed above, we conclude that:\n- Long spin period systems (Ps3 &1) require magnetar-like B-fields (\u03bc33 &0.1) in order for a large\nluminosity swing (\u223c105 ) to arise from modest variations in the wind parameters (e.g. a factor \u223c5\nin \u1e40\u22126 ). These luminosity swings might result from transition across different regimes through both\nthe centrifugal and magnetic barriers.\n- Shorter spin period systems (Ps3 \u226a1) must posses lower magnetic fields (\u03bc33 \u226a0.1) for similar\ntransitions to take place. Somewhat larger variations in the wind parameters are required in order\nto achieve similar luminosity swings to those of the long period case, and transitions between different regimes occur in most cases through the centrifugal barrier.\n- Few or no transitions are expected for systems with either high magnetic fields and short spin\nperiods, or systems with lower magnetic fields and long spin periods. In the first case the centrifugal barrier halts the inflowing matter at RM and accretion does not take place; such systems might\nthus be observable only at very low (X-ray) luminosity levels (\u22431032 -1033 erg s\u22121 ). In the second\ncase RM <Rco for a wide range of wind parameters, accretion can take place, and a high persistent\nluminosity is released (\u22431035 -1037 erg s\u22121 ).\n\n4. Application to SFXT sources\nIn this section we propose that transitions across different regimes caused by relatively mild\n8\n\n\fMagnetars and SFXTs\n\nE. Bozzo\n\nvariations of the wind parameters are responsible for the outbursts of SFXTs. As a case study\nwe consider IGR J17544-2619 (Sunyaev et al., 2003), a SFXT observed by Chandra during a\ncomplex transition to and from a \u223c1 hour-long outburst, yielding the first detailed characterization of a SFXT light curve over a wide range of luminosity. The spin period of IGR J175442619 is presently unknown. In't Zand (2005) showed that four different stages, with very different luminosity levels, could be singled out during the Chandra observation: (a) a quiescent state\nwith LX \u22432\u00d71032 erg s\u22121 , (b) a rise stage with LX \u22431.5\u00d71034 erg s\u22121 , (c) the outburst peak with\nLX \u22434\u00d71037 erg s\u22121 , and (d) a post-outburst stage (or\"tail\") with LX \u22432\u00d71036 erg s\u22121 (see panel\n(a) of Fig. 4; these luminosities are for a source distance of \u223c3.6 kpc, Rahoui et al., 2008). The\nmaximum luminosity swing observed across these stages was a factor of &6.5\u00d7104 .\nMotivated by the evidence for >1000 s periodicities in XTE J1739-302 and IGR J16479-4514,\nwe discuss first the possibility that IGR J17544-2619 contains a very slowly spinning NS. We use\n\u03bc33 =1, Ps3 =1.3, v8 =1.4, and show in Fig. 4(b) the different regimes experienced by such a NS as a\nfunction of the mass loss rate. For \u1e40\u22126 <20 the above values give RM >Ra and RM >Rco , such that\nsuperKeplerian magnetic inhibition of accretion applies. The expected luminosity in this regime,\n\u223c1031 erg s\u22121 , is likely outshined by the X-ray luminosity of the supergiant star (the companion\nstar's luminosity is not shown in Fig. 4, but it is typically of order \u223c1032 erg s\u22121 , Cassinelli et\nal., 1981). We conclude that the lowest emission state (quiescence) of IGR J17544-2619 can be\nexplained in this way, with the companion star dominating the high energy luminosity (In't Zand,\n2005). The rise stage is in good agreement with the subKeplerian magnetic inhibition regime,\nwhere the luminosity (\u223c1034 erg s\u22121 ) is dominated by accretion of matter onto the NS due to the\nKHI. The uncertainty in the value of h translates into an upper limit on the luminosity in this regime\nwhich is a factor of \u223c10 higher than that given above (Bozzo et al., 2008). During the outburst\npeak the direct accretion regime must apply at a mass loss rate of \u1e40\u22126 =500. In this interpretation\ndirect accretion must also be at work in the outburst tail at \u1e40\u22126 \u223c3, where a slight decrease in \u1e40w\nwould cause the magnetic barrier to close and the source to return to quiescence. According to this\ninterpretation, if IGR J17544-2619 has a spin period of >1000 s, then it must host a magnetar.\nPanel (c) of Fig. 4 shows an alternative interpretation of the IGR J17544-2619 light curve,\nwhere we fixed \u03bc33 =0.08, Ps3 =0.4, and v8 =1. For this somewhat faster spin (and lower magnetic\nfield), the luminosity variation is mainly driven by a transition across the centrifugal barrier (as\nopposed to the magnetic barrier). In this case, the quiescent state corresponds to the supersonic\npropeller regime (\u1e40\u22126 <0.6), the rise stage to the subsonic propeller (0.6<\u1e40\u22126 <2), while both\nthe peak of the outburst and tail take place in the direct accretion regime at \u1e40\u22126 =200 and \u1e40\u22126 =10,\nrespectively. Assuming an even faster NS spin period for IGR J17544-2619, a weaker magnetic\nfield would be required. In panel (d) of Fig. 4, we show the results obtained by adopting \u03bc33 =0.001,\nPs3 =0.01, and v8 =2. The \u223c1034 erg s\u22121 luminosity in the subsonic propeller regime compares well\nwith the luminosity in the rise stage. However, the luminosity of the supersonic propeller regime is\nnow significantly higher than the quiescence luminosity of \u223c1032 erg s\u22121 (this is a consequence of\nthe higher value of \u1e40w for which the supersonic propeller regime is attained in this interpretation).\nWe note that, the whole luminosity swing takes place for a wider range of mass loss rates, and the\noutburst peak luminosity requires \u1e40\u22126 \u22433000, an extremely high value even for an OB supergiant.\nInterpreting the properties of IGR J17544-2619 in terms of a NS with a spin periods \u226a100 s\nis more difficult. For instance, for the subsonic propeller regime to set in, the mass loss rate\n9\n\n\fMagnetars and SFXTs\n\nE. Bozzo\n\ncorresponding to the transition across RM =Rco must be lower than the limit fixed by Eq. 2.14.\nIf instead the transition takes place at higher mass loss rate, the system goes directly from the\nsupersonic propeller to the direct accretion regime (or vice versa), bypassing the subsonic propeller:\ntherefore, the rise stage would remain unexplained. Since fast rotating NSs require lower magnetic\nfields for direct accretion to take place while in outburst, Eq. 2.14 is satisfied only for very high\nwind velocities (v8 >2-3). On the other hand, an increase by a factor of \u223c2 in the wind velocity\n(with respect to the longer spin period solutions) would give a substantially lower \u1e40capt , such that\nthe subsonic and the direct accretion regime luminosities fall shortwards of the observed values\n(unless unrealistically high mass loss rate are considered). Based on the above discussion, we\nconclude that IGR J17544-2619 likely hosts a slowly rotating NS, with spin period >100 s. Whether\nthe magnetic barrier or the centrifugal barrier sets in, causing inhibition of accretion away from\nthe outbursts, will depend on whether the spin period is longer or shorter then \u223c1000 s.\nAs another example we discuss the case of IGR J16465-4507, a SFXTs with a spin period of\n228 s. The luminosity behaviour of this source is still poorly known. An outburst at 5\u00d71036 erg s\u22121\nwas observed with INTEGRAL (assuming a distance of 12.5 kpc, Lutovinov et al., 2005; Smith,\n2004), which did not detect the source before the outburst down to a level of 5\u00d71035 erg s\u22121 .\nAbout a week later, XMM-Newton revealed the source at 5\u00d71034 erg s\u22121 and discovered the 228 s\npulsations (Lutovinov et al., 2005). If the direct accretion regime applied all the way to the lowest\nluminosity level observed so far, then an upper limit of \u03bc33 \u22430.004 would be obtained by imposing\nthat the NS did not enter the subsonic propeller regime. On the other hand, if the luminosity\nmeasured by XMM-Newton signalled that the source entered the subsonic propeller regime, while\ndirect accretion occurred only during the outburst detected by INTEGRAL, then a considerably\nhigher magnetic field of \u03bc33 \u22430.07 would be required.\nThe above discussion emphasizes the importance of determining, through extended high sensitivity observations, the luminosity at which transitions between different source states occur, in\nparticular the lowest luminosity level for which direct accretion is still at work. In combination\nwith the NS spin, this can be used to infer the NS magnetic field. Alternatively accretion might take\nplace unimpeded at all luminosity levels of SFXTs, a possibility which requires a very clumpy wind\nas envisaged in other scenarios (Walter & Zurita Heras, 2007). In this case the NS magnetic field\ncan be considerably lower than discussed here.\n\n5. Conclusions\nIn this paper we reviewed the theory of wind accretion in HMXBs hosting a magnetic NS\nwith a supergiant companion, and considered in some detail the interaction processes between the\ninflowing plasma and the magnetosphere, that are expected to take place when direct accretion\nonto the NS surface is inhibited. We then applied this theory to SFXTs and showed that their large\nluminosity swings between quiescence and outburst (up to a factor of \u223c105 ) can be attained in\nresponse to relatively modest variations of the wind parameters, provided the system undergoes\ntransitions across different regimes. We found that such transitions can be driven mainly by either:\n(a) a centrifugal barrier mechanism, which halts direct accretion when the NS rotation becomes\nsuperKeplerian at the magnetospheric radius, or (b) a magnetic barrier mechanism, when the magnetosphere extends beyond the accretion radius.

According to In't Zand (2005), the\ncount rates on the y-axis correspond to 2 \u00d7 1032 erg s\u22121 , 1.5 \u00d7 1034 erg s\u22121 , 2 \u00d7 1036 erg s\u22121 , and 4 \u00d7 1037 erg s\u22121 , in the quiescence\nstate, the rise state, the tail, and the peak of the outburst, respectively.

In particular, the magnetic barrier mechanism requires long\nspin periods (&1000 s) coupled with magnetar-like fields (&1014 G). On the other hand, magnetarlike fields would also be required if the centrifugal barrier sets in at relatively high luminosities\n(& 1036 erg s\u22121 ) in NSs with spin periods of hundreds seconds.\nEvidence has been found that the spin periods of a few SFXTs might be as long as 1000-2000 s.\nMotivated by this, we presented an interpretation of the activity of IGR J17544-2619 (whose spin\nperiod is unknown) in terms of the magnetic barrier by a 1300 s spinning NS and showed that\nthe luminosity stages singled out in a Chandra observation of this source are well matched by\nthe different regimes of wind-magnetosphere interaction expected in this case. We discussed also\nan interpretation of this source based on the centrifugal barrier and a slightly shorter spin period\n(400 s), which can reproduce the luminosity stages comparably well. We emphasise that in both\nsolutions the required magnetic field strength (&1015 G and &8\u00d71013 G, respectively) are in the\nmagnetar range.\nWhile the possibility that magnetars are hosted in binary system with supergiant companions has been investigated by several authors (e.g., Zhang et al., 2004; Liu & Yan, 2006), clear\nobservational evidence for such extremely high magnetic field NS in binary systems is still missing. According to the present study, long spin period SFXTs might provide a new prospective for\ndetecting and studying magnetars in binary systems.\n\nAcknowledgments\nEB thanks DTU Space, Technical University of Denmark and IASF-INAF for grant support\nfor this conference.
