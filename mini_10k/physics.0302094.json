The scattering physics is governed by strong anisotropic long-range interactions, which lead\nto pronounced coupling among the partial waves of relative motion. As a result, nonadiabatic\ntransitions are shown to trigger a high rate of inelastic losses. At relatively high energies, T > 100\u03bcK,\nthe total inelastic collision rate is comparable with the elastic rate. However, at lower collisional\nenergy, the elastic rate decreases, and at T \u223c 1\u03bcK, it becomes substantially smaller than the inelastic\nrate. Our study suggests that magnetic trapping and evaporative cooling of 88 Sr [(5s5p)3 P2 ] atoms,\nas well as 40 Ca [(4s4p)3 P2 ], in low-field seeking states will prove difficult to achieve experimentally.\nPACS numbers: 34.50.-s,34.20.Cf, 34.20.Mq\n\nIn recent years, the trapping and cooling of alkalineearth atoms has been pursued with increased interest.\nTrapping experiments with 88 Sr [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and 40 Ca\n[6, 7] atoms have been carried out, and experiments are\nunderway in a number of laboratories. One major thrust\nof this research track is to extend the small class of\natomic species that have been Bose-Einstein condensed.\nAlso, the most prevalent isotopes have closed-shell nuclei,\nwhich eliminates complications from hyperfine structure\nand simplifies the interpretation of cold collision data [8].\nThe usual route to quantum degeneracy utilizes magnetic trapping and evaporative cooling of precooled\natoms. Since ground-state alkaline-earth atoms possess\nno magnetic dipole moment, some experimental groups\nwork with a system of alkaline-earth atoms in their lowest\n(nsnp)3 P2 metastable state [3, 4, 5, 7, 9]. The radiative\nlifetime of this state is of the order of ten minutes [10].\nHowever, as we show in this Letter, it is not spontaneous\nemission that ultimately limits the magnetic-trap lifetime\nof metastable alkaline-earth atoms. Their nonspherical\nelectronic structure gives rise to strong anisotropic interatomic interactions not present in ground-state alkali\nmetals, hydrogen, or metastable helium. In the present\nstudy, these interactions are predicted to generate severe\ninelastic losses.\nDerevianko et al. [11] were the first to theoretically approach the intriguing problem of anisotropic long-range\ninteractions between metastable alkaline-earth atoms in\nan external magnetic field. Their study revealed important insights, notably the existence of a long-range molecular potential well. They also provided a first estimate\nof inelastic losses within a two-channel model, but at a\nqualitative level only. Recently, Ref. [12] performed a\ndetailed tensorial analysis of the anisotropic long-range\nforces between two nonspherical atoms in a magnetic field\nand investigated the associated coupling between electronic structure and molecular rotational motion. A twobody potential was derived that is ideal for multichannelscattering calculations. The present work has the goal\nto carry the aforementioned theoretical studies to the\n\nnext level, and thus to provide guidance to experimentalists. Specifically, we develop a quantitative quantum\ndescription of the two-body elastic and inelastic collisions\nbetween alkaline-earth atoms in the (nsnp)3 P2 excited\nstate. We focus on strontium atoms but briefly address\nimplications of the present study to Ca and other similar\natoms.\nOur treatment is based on the multichannel potential\nderived in Ref. [12]:\nL2\n+ \u0124I \u2212 (\u03bc(1) + \u03bc(2) ) * B,\n2mred R2\nX \u221a\n2K + 1 [CK \u2297 PTK P]0,0 ,\n\u0124I =\nV\u0302 =\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nK=0,2,4\n\nwhich is a function of internuclear distance R. L is the\noperator of the angular momentum associated with the\nrotation of the molecular frame, mred is the reduced mass\nof the system, \u03bc(1) and \u03bc(2) are magnetic dipole operators of the two atoms, and B is the vector of the magnetic\nfield. The term \u0124I is the effective interatomic interaction Hamiltonian acting in the electronic subspace of two\n(nsnp)3 P2 atoms, as indicated by the projection operator\nP. \u0124I is a totally invariant tensor, consisting of three distinct contributions, which derive from coupling of rankK tensor operators CK and TK . CK is associated with\nmolecular rotational motion, TK describes specific electronic couplings. Electric dipole-dipole dispersion forces\ncontribute to K = 0, 2, and 4, magnetic dipole-dipole interaction enters T2 , and electric quadrupole-quadrupole\ninteraction contributes to T4 [12]. For the incident channels of interest, and for magnetic fields of a few gauss\nor stronger, all collision dynamics at cold temperatures\ntakes place at interatomic distances of about 100 Bohr\nradii. Thus, using a pure long-range Hamiltonian is justified. In the present calculation the potential V\u0302 is represented by a matrix in the coupled angular momentum\nbasis and evaluated using Wigner-Racah algebra.\nThe potential matrix of Eq. 1 can be diagonalized at\ndifferent R, giving a set of adiabatic potential curves.\n\n\f2\nAt large internuclear distances, the potential curves converge to nine different dissociation limits, corresponding\nto nine different values (Mel = \u22124, . . . , 4) of the total\nelectronic angular momentum projection on the direction\nof the magnetic field. We assume that the initial relative\nkinetic energy is low enough (< 100\u03bcK), so that we may\nlimit our treatment to the s-wave (L = 0) initial channel. However, other channels with L > 0 are present in\nour model as possible escape channels. The technique of\nmagnetic trapping is limited to low-field seeking atomic\nstates, i.e., the states with a negative projection of the\nmagnetic atomic moment \u03bc on the direction of the field.\nWe assume that initially, before a collision, the two atoms\nhave a specific Mtot projection of the total angular momentum including molecular frame rotation. The states\nwith different Mtot projections are not coupled and can\nbe treated separately. Thus, Mtot , unlike Mel , is conserved during the collision. In the initial channel L = 0,\nthus Mel = Mtot for this channel.\n0.23\n0.2\n\nPotential energy (K)\n\n0.1\n\n0.22\n\n0\n-0.1\n-0.2\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n0.21\n\n0.2\n20\n\n80\n\n100\n\nL=22\n\n18\n\n16\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\nInternuclear distance (a.u.)\n\nFIG. 1: Adiabatic potential curves of Sr2 [3 P2 ] calculated for\na magnetic field B = 500 G. The maximum Lmax partial\nwave taken into account for these curves is 22 . The incident\nchannel (Mel = 4, L = 0) is marked by a big arrow. The\navoided crossing, marked by a circle, produces a large inelastic\nrate. Numbers at the bottom of the plot specify the angular\nmomentum L of different partial wave channels converging to\nthe Mel = 3 Zeeman level. Note, that at distances of about\n100 a.u. different partial waves are mixed. The inset shows\nthe same potential curves on a larger energy scale. In the\ninset one can see all nine dissociative limits corresponding to\nnine Zeeman levels of the two separated strontium atoms.\n\nFigure 1 gives an example of the adiabatic potential\ncurves for Mtot = 4 at the magnetic field B = 500 gauss.\nIn the present calculation we have included partial waves\nof rotating Sr2 molecular frame up to L = 22. The entrance s-wave channel is marked by a thick line. This\nchannel has a potential well situated around R = 90\na.u. The well is formed by the interplay of Zeeman,\nquadrupole-quadrupole and dispersion interactions between the two atoms [11, 12]. The shape and depth of\nthe well changes with the magnetic field. This fact allows\n\nto change scattering properties of two-body collisions in\npresence of the field. References [11, 12] suggest that at\nsome magnetic field the elastic scattering length can be\nmade very large, allowing fast evaporative cooling.\nThe key feature in Fig. 1 is a pronounced avoided\ncrossing at 80-90 a.u. This avoided crossing is mostly\nformed between the entrance-channel curve and a curve\nconverging to a lower dissociation limit with (Mel =\n3, L = 14) (see the encircled region in Fig. 1). Other\nstates are mixed as well in this region, but they play a\nsecondary role. According to the familiar Landau-Zener\nmodel [13], such an avoided crossing produces a large\ntransition probability from the entrance channel into the\n(Mtot = 3, L = 14) channel. This is because the energy of the avoided crossing is close to the total energy\nof the system, and the two curves are almost parallel near\nthe avoided crossing. Thus, at low collision energies, one\nwould expect the inelastic cross-sections to be relatively\nhigh.\nIn the previous theoretical study [11], Derevianko et\nal. have calculated the elastic collisional rates and estimated the inelastic rates as well. Their conclusion was\nthat inelastic collisions do not significantly contribute to\nthe total rate. However, in that study, several simplifying\nassumptions were made. The most important is that the\nauthors estimated the inelastic losses using a two-channel\nmodel. The model includes an s-wave channel coupled\nto a g-wave channel by the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction. Our calculations show, however, that higher,\nL > 6, partial waves are particularly important in the\nloss process. We have found that L = 4 does not play\nany important role in the losses, which is in agreement\nwith Ref. [11]. This effect of higher L is apparent in\nFig. 1, where the channels (Mel = 4, L = 0) and\n\u2032\n(Mel\n= 3, L\u2032 = 14) are strongly mixed around R = 85\na.u. At different magnetic field, different partial waves\nplay a dominant role in the inelastic collisions. In other\nwords, the avoided crossing in Fig. 1 can be formed by\n\u2032\nthe states (Mel = 4, L = 0) and (Mel\n= 3, L\u2032 ) with L\u2032\ndepending on the field. The inclusion of the higher partial\nwaves not only produces larger non-adiabatic dynamical\neffects, but it also modifies the shape of adiabatic curves.\nThis would mean that Derevianko et al. [11] might underestimate the inelastic rates by neglecting the channels\nthat 1) modify the entrance adiabatic channel and that\n2) control the inelastic losses associated with the strong\nnonadiabatic coupling. The strong multichannel coupling\nnot only causes the large inelastic losses; it significantly\nmodifies the elastic scattering. This makes the concept\nof adiabaticity, adopted in Ref. [11], inapplicable to the\npresent case.\nThe above analysis of the adiabatic potential curves\ndevelops a qualitative description of two-body collisions.\nTo obtain quantitative results, we solve the coupled radial Schr\u00f6dinger equations for the potential operator of\nEq. 1:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\nd2 \u02c6\n\u02c6\n~\n\u2212\nI + V\u0302 \u2212 E I \u03a8(R)\n= 0.\n(3)\n2mred dR2\n\n\f3\n\n3\n\nElastic rate (cm /s)\n\n1e-10\n\n1e-11\n\n1e-12\n\n1 mK\n100 \u03bcK\n10 \u03bcK\n1 \u03bcK\n\n3\n\nInelastic rate (cm /s)\n\n1e-13\n\n1e-10\n\n1e-11\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\nB (G)\nFIG. 2: Elastic (upper panel) and total inelastic (lower\npanel) rates of the Sr[(3 P2 )]+Sr[(3 P2 )] collisions as a function of magnetic field for several incident relative kinetic energies of the two strontium atoms. The entrance channel is\n(Mel = 4, L = 0). At 1 mK, incoming partial waves with\nL > 0 can penetrate their respective angular momentum barriers. Their contribution is not included in this plot. (See\nFig. 3)\n\n~\nHere E is the total energy of the system, \u03a8(R)\nis the mul\u02c6\nticomponent radial wavefunction, I is the identity operator. When solving the equation, we work in the coupled\nchannel (diabatic) representation rather than in the adiabatic representation. This choice is justified by the fact\nthat in the diabatic representation, all diagonal and nondiagonal couplings are smooth functions of R. Out of\nthe possible diabatic basis sets we adopt the atomic set,\nwhich diagonalizes the two-body potential V\u0302 at R = \u221e.\nFor a given asymptotic collisional energy in the entrance channel, we obtain the total scattering matrix S\nusing the one-dimensional R-matrix approach [14, 15].\nThe R-matrix is obtained solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation within R < R0 = 1500 a.u. using finite elements\n[15] as a representation basis. Having obtained the total\nS-matrix, the elastic and inelastic rates \u03b1i as function of\nE are given by familiar formulas (in atomic units):\nki\u2032\n\u03c0\n2\n\u03c3i,i\u2032 =\n|Si,i\u2032 \u2212 \u03b4i,i\u2032 | ,\n(4)\nmred\nki\u2032 mred\np\nwhere ki\u2032 = 2mred(E \u2212 Ei\u2032 ) is the incident de Broglie\nwavenumber, Ei\u2032 is the energy of the incident channel,\nand \u03c3i,i\u2032 is the corresponding cross-section. The entrance\n\u03b1i =\n\nchannel is specified by index i\u2032 . In our discussion of collision rates, we do not utilize the scattering length, because\nit is not energy-independent at energies E > 100\u03bcK for\nthis system.\nIn order to check the reliability of the present results,\nwe tested convergence with respect to different numerical\nand physical parameters of the problem. Two of these,\nin particular, deserve mention here. The first is a convergence test of the calculated S-matrix with respect to the\nposition of the inner boundary in the numerical calculations. Since we have neglected the short-range molecular\ninteraction (we do not have the corresponding data), we\nhave to be sure that no flux penetrates into the inner\nregion, i.e. the collisional dynamics is controlled only by\nlong-range potentials. As a result, we have found that\nfor the (Mel = 4) entrance channel, at low energies below 1mK, no flux penetrates into the short-range region.\nHowever, the calculation for all the other low-field seeking magnetic states, (Mel = 1, 2, 3), shows that there is\na substantial probability of penetration, and therefore,\nthe inelastic rate is expected to be large. These entrance\nchannels cannot be treated unless one includes the shortrange molecular dynamics. Thus, the following treatment is concentrated on the (Mel = 4, L = 0) entrance\nchannel solely. The second test is an assessment of convergence with respect to the maximum number of partial waves that are included in the calculations. As was\ndiscussed above, most of the inelastic losses occur due\nto the avoided crossing in the potential well of the incident channel. At the largest magnetic field considered\nhere, B=1000 G, the avoided crossing is formed by an\ninteraction with the Mel = 3, L = 14 channel. Performing the full S-matrix calculation with maximum number\nof partial waves, Lmax , up to 18, we have found that,\nindeed, the inelastic and elastic rates are converged at\nLmax = 14. This test underlines the effect of the molecular frame rotation on the scattering process.\nFigure 2 shows the inelastic and elastic rates as a function of the external magnetic field for several incident kinetic energies. The resonant-like behavior of the curves\naround 400 G is caused by the emergence of a quasibound level in the entrance channel. Due to the strong\ninelastic loss, the resonance is significantly washed out.\nDerevianko et al. [11] have predicted a resonance at a\nfield of about 1000 G. Since they neglected the inelastic\nlosses in their model, their elastic rate diverges to infinity\nat the resonant B-field. In experiments aimed to obtain\na Bose-Einstein condensate, one is particularly interested\nin the ratio between the elastic and inelastic rates. Figure 2 suggests that for strontium in the (5s5p)3 P2 state,\nevaporative cooling will not be efficient at temperatures\nbelow 10 \u03bcK. Figure 3 shows the rates as a function of\nthe relative incident kinetic energy. The rates of inelastic scattering into individual magnetic sublevels are separated. The magnetic field is fixed at B = 100 G. As was\nexpected from the analysis of adiabatic curves shown in\nFig. 1, the sublevel Mel = 3 is responsible for most of\nthe inelastic losses.\n\n\f4\n\n-11\n\n3\n\nRate (cm /s)\n\n10\n\n10\n\nquantities). Although such a variation of the atomic parameters modifies the results, the main result remains\nthe same, namely an unfavorable elastic/inelastic ratio\nat submillikelvin collisional energies. We point out that\na similar result was recently obtained in the analysis of\nthe collisions between two polar molecules [16] in an external electric field. Thus, large inelastic rates apparently\nrule out the possibility of cooling atoms or molecules with\nlarge anisotropic multipole interactions down to submicrokelvin temperatures using magnetic traps.\n\nTotal inelastic\nMel=4, elastic\nMel=3\nMel=2\nMel=1\nMel=0\nMel=-1\n\n-12\n\n10\n\n-13\n\n10\n\n-9\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n10\n\n-7\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-3\n\nEnergy (K)\n\nFIG. 3: The elastic and inelastic collision rates are shown\nas functions of the relative incident kinetic energy. This plot\nseparates the contributions to the total inelastic rate from\ndifferent Zeeman levels. The contribution from the lowest\nZeeman levels are not shown since they are very small. For\nthis plot, we have included contributions from all higher L > 0\npartial waves in the entrance channel. The higher partial\nwaves are important at energies above 100 \u03bcK.\n\nIn view of experimental interest in other metastable\nalkaline-earth atoms, we have carried out a similar calculation for calcium atoms in the (4s4p)3 P2 state and\nobtained a comparable result for the elastic and inelastic rates. The main difference is that the resonance for\nCa2 is shifted toward larger magnetic fields. To assess whether any other species is likely to produce a\nmore favorable elastic/inelastic ratio, we have completed\na model calculation in which we artificially change the\nquadrupole moment, the nuclear mass and the dispersion coefficients (see Refs.

In this context, the\nsituation is similar to the case studied in atomic cesium.\nEarly experiments attempting Bose-Einstein condensate\nof Cs (see, for example [18]) using magnetic trapping approaches had shown that the degenerate regime can not\nbe reached due to a rapid loss of atoms at short internuclear distances. In the case of Cs, the losses were caused\nby a large spin-flip cross-section. Recently, the group of\nGrimm [17] utilized a purely optical trap of Cs atoms and\nsuccessfully achieved a Cs Bose-Einstein condensate.\nConclusion. We have calculated the elastic and inelastic two-body collisional rates of metastable strontium\natoms in the [(5s5p)3 P2 ] state and metastable calcium\natoms in the [(4s4p)3 P2 ] state. At low temperatures,\n< 1\u03bcK, collisions in all low-field seeking states are dominated by inelastic processes. This appears to rule out the\npossiblity of achieving a Bose-Einstein condensate with\nthese metastable atoms, using magnetic traps.\nThis work has been supported in part by the DOE Office of Science and by an allocation of NERSC supercomputing resources.
