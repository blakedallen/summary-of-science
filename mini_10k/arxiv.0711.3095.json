This\nproperty may also be expected for Cooper pairs entering a normal metal from a superconductor\ndue to the proximity effect. We show, however, that such a deduction is incorrect and the pairing\nfunction in a normal metal is surprisingly anisotropic because of quasiparticle interference. We\ncalculate angle resolved quasiparticle density of states in NS bilayers which reflects such anisotropic\nshape of the pairing function. We also propose a magneto-tunneling spectroscopy experiment which\ncould confirm our predictions.\nPACS numbers: 74.45.+c, 74.50.+r, 74.20.Rp\n\nIt is well known that Cooper pairs consisting of two\nelectrons are characterized by electric charge 2e, macroscopic phase, internal spin, and by time and orbital structures [1]. The charge 2e manifests itself in various experiments, like Shapiro steps, flux quantization and excess\ncurrent due to the Andreev reflection. The macroscopic\nphase generates the Josephson current [1]. The internal spin structure is classified into spin-triplet and spinsinglet states which can be identified by nuclear magnetic\nresonance. Further, based on a symmetry with respect\nto the internal time, superconducting state can belong\nto the even-frequency or the odd-frequency symmetry\nclass [3]. The orbital degree of freedom is described by an\nangular momentum quantum number l. In s-wave superconductors with l = 0, the Cooper pair wave function is\nspherically symmetric on the Fermi surface, i.e. an angular structure of a Cooper pair is isotropic in momentum\nspace. The shape of Cooper pairs in p-wave (l = 1) and\nd-wave (l = 2) superconductors is characterized by twofold and four-fold symmetries, respectively [2]. The well\nestablished properties listed above hold in bulk superconductors. The presence of perturbations like spin-flip or\ninterface scattering may change the symmetry of Cooper\npairs. For instance, unusual odd-frequency property of\nCooper pairs in proximity structures was predicted in recent studies [4, 5]. The shape of Cooper pair wave function in non-uniform systems like superconducting junctions is not necessarily the same as that in the bulk state.\nDespite the extensive study of the proximity effect during several past decades, rather little attention has been\npaid to the problem of Cooper pair shape in non-uniform\nsuperconducting systems [6, 7]. This issue is quite important in view of current interest to the physics of superconducting nanostructures.\nThe aim of the present Letter is to clarify the consequences of breakdown of translational symmetry in\nsuperconductors on the Cooper pair shape. For this\npurpose, we study the proximity effect in quasi two-\n\nFIG. 1: A schematic illustration of a N/S junction.\n\ndimensional normal metal / superconductor (N/S) junctions by solving the Eilenberger equation, treating selfconsistently the spatial variation of the superconducting\npair potential. We analyze the pairing function and the\nlocal density of states (LDOS) in N/S junctions with\nspin-singlet s-wave and spin-triplet px -wave superconductors. Surprisingly, the pairing function in a normal\nmetal turns out to be strongly anisotropic even in junctions with s-wave superconductors. To detect the complex Cooper pair shape, we propose to use scanning tunneling spectroscopy in rotating magnetic field. We show\nthat the calculated tunneling conductance exhibits complex patterns even in the s-wave case.\nLet us consider a quasi-two dimensional N/S junction\nas shown in Fig. 1 which is the simplest example of nonuniform superconducting system, where the S region is\nsemi-infinite and the normal metal has finite length L. In\nthe case of px -wave superconductor, we assume for simplicity that triplet Cooper pairs consist of two electrons\nwith opposite spin projections on z-axis, i.e. SZ = 0.\nThese assumptions do not limit the generality of the discussion below. We consider a perfect N/S interface with\nfull transmissivity, while it can be shown that characteristic behavior of Cooper pairs remains qualitatively\nunchanged even in the presence of a potential barrier at\nthe N/S interface.\nThe quasiclassical Green's functions [8] in a normal\nmetal (N) and a superconductor (S) are parameterized\n\n\f2\nas\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\n\u011d\u00b1 = f1\u00b1 \u03c4\u03021 + f2\u00b1 \u03c4\u03022 + g\u00b1 \u03c4\u03023 , (\u011d\u00b1 )2 = 1\u0302,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere a superscript i(= N, S) refers to N and S, \u03c4\u0302j\n(j = 1 \u2212 3) are the Pauli matrices, and 1\u0302 is a unit matrix.

In the clean\nlimit, we consider \u03b40 \u226a \u22060 . Boundary condition at x =\n(N )\n(N )\n\u2212L is given by \u03b6\u00b1 (\u2212L) = \u2212\u0393\u2213 (\u2212L). Boundary con(S)\n(N )\ndition at the N/S interface becomes \u03b6\u00b1 (0) = \u2212\u0393\u00b1 (0)\n(S)\n(N )\n \u0304 \u00b1 (x) is\nand \u03b6\u00b1 (0) = \u2212\u0393\u00b1 (0). The pair potential \u2206\n \u0304\nexpressed by \u2206\u00b1 (x) = \u2206(x)\u03a6\u00b1 (\u03b8)\u0398(x), where a form\nfactor \u03a6\u00b1 (\u03b8) is given by \u03a6\u00b1 (\u03b8) = 1 for s-wave symmetry and \u00b1 cos \u03b8 for px -wave one with \u03b8 being an incident\nangle of a quasiparticle measured from the x direction.\nBulk pair potential is \u2206(\u221e) = \u22060 , and we determine the\nspatial dependence \u2206(x) in a self-consistent way.\n(i)\nFor x \u226b L0 , the angular structure of f2\u00b1 follows\n(i)\nthat of the pair potential, whereas f1\u00b1 is zero with\nL0 = vF /2\u03c0TC being a coherence length and TC being\n(i)\nthe transition temperature. The pairing function f1\u00b1 is\ngenerated by inhomogeneity in a system and thus has\na finite value only near the interface and in a normal\n(i)\nmetal. Recent study [10] showed that f1\u00b1 has an odd(i)\nfrequency symmetry. Generally speaking, functions f1\u00b1\n(i)\nand f2\u00b1 have opposite parities. If a superconductor has\ns- (px )-wave symmetry, the induced odd-frequency component has the odd (even) parity, respectively. Pairing function f1 is defined in the angular domain of\n\u2212\u03c0/2 \u2264 \u03b8 < 3\u03c0/2. We denote f1 (\u03b8) by f1+ (\u03b8) in the\nangle range \u2212\u03c0/2 \u2264 \u03b8 < \u03c0/2 and f1 (\u03b8) = f1\u2212 (\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8) for\n\u03c0/2 \u2264 \u03b8 < 3\u03c0/2. The angular structure of functions f2\nand g is defined in the same manner. LDOS is given by\nthe relation \u03c1L (\u03b8) = Real[g(\u03b8)]. In what follows, we fix\n\ntemperature T = 0.05TC , the length of the normal region\nL = 5L0 , and \u03b40 = 0.01\u22060 .\nIn Figs. 2 and 3 we show polar plots of f1 , f2 , and\n\u03c1L in a s-wave and px -wave junctions for several choices\nof \u03b5 and x. Black, red and blue lines represent, respectively, the results for x = \u221e (superconductor), x = 0\n(interface), and x = \u2212L/2 (normal metal). The oddfrequency component is always absent for x = \u221e. Since\n\u03c1L is independent of x in N, the resulting value of \u03c1L at\nx = 0 is equal to that at x = \u2212L/2.\nFirst, we focus on the s-wave case (Fig. 2). At \u03b5 =\n0 in Fig. 2(a), the even-frequency component f2 has a\ncircular shape reflecting s-wave symmetry for x = \u221e\nand 0. However, at x = \u2212L/2, the shape is no longer a\nsimple circular but a double distorted circles. The shape\nof f2 in superconductor always has the circular shape\nindependent of \u03b5 as shown with black broken lines in\nFig.2(a), (d), and (g). At \u03b5 = 0.1\u22060 in Fig.2(d), f2 at\nthe interface (red line) slightly deviates from the circular\nshape, while the shape in N drastically changes. The\ntendency is more remarkable at \u03b5 = 0.5\u22060 in Fig.2(g).\nThe butterfly-like pattern seen in f2 at the interface (red\nline in Fig.2(g)) is completely different from the original\ncircular shape in a superconductor. At \u03b5 = 0, f1 at the\ninterface becomes ellipsoidal as shown in a red line in\nFig.2(b). The shape of f1 at x = 0 and x = \u2212L/2 shows\nthe butterfly-like pattern (Fig. 2(e)). For \u03b5 = 0.5\u22060 ,\nthe line shape of f1 has many spikes as shown in Fig.\n2(h). Such anisotropic property of f1 and f2 affects the\nLDOS as shown in Fig.2(c), (f), and (i). In particular,\nLDOS at the interface for \u03b5 = 0.5\u22060 (red line in (i))\nstrongly deviates from the circular shape. The LDOS\nin a superconductor vanishes at \u03b5 < \u22060 (black lines in\nFig.2(f) and (i)). At the interface, the shape of \u03c1L in\nFig.2(c) is quite similar to that of f1 in Fig.2(b). These\nprofiles can be qualitatively understood as follows. At\nx = 0, the following relations hold\n1 + \u03b12 N\n1 + \u03b12 \u03932\n1 \u2212 \u03b12\n(N )\n, f2\u00b1 = i\u0393\n, g\u00b1 =\n,\n\u039e\n\u039e\n\u039e\n(5)\n(S)\nwith \u039e = 1 \u2212 \u03932 \u03b12 , \u0393 = \u0393\u00b1 (0) and \u03b1 =\nexp[2i\u03b5L/(vF cos \u03b8)]. For \u03b5 \u226a \u22060 , \u0393 \u223c 1/i and f1\u00b1 \u223c\nig\u00b1 are satisfied. Thus shape of function f1 is similar\nto that of \u03c1L . This argument seems to be valid even\nfor \u03b5 = 0.1\u22060 in Fig.2(e) and (f), and for \u03b5 = 0.5\u22060 in\nFig.2(h) and (i). The oscillating behavior in f1 , f2 , and\n\u03c1L is more remarkable at \u03b5 = 0.5\u22060 . Although we do not\npresent calculated results of f1 and f2 at x = \u2212L/2 for\n\u03b5 = 0.5\u22060 , the butterfly-like pattern with many spikes in\nthe pairing functions can be seen also in a normal metal.\nThe directions of the spin projections in LDOS are characterized by small value of \u039e, which has close relation to\nthe formation of the bound states [11]. For \u03b8 \u223c \u00b1\u03c0/2,\n\u03b1 oscillates rapidly with small variation of \u03b8, which explains the fine structures in LDOS around \u03b8 = \u00b1\u03c0/2.\n(N )\n\nf1\u00b1 = \u00b1\u0393\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) The results for s-wave symmetry.

The angle \u03b8 is measured from the x-axis.\n\nThe quasiparticle interference effect is a source of bound\nstate formation in a normal metal. As a result, the circular shape of Cooper pairs in s-wave superconductor is\nmodified into the butterfly-like pattern in a normal metal.\nNext, we discuss the results for px -wave junctions\nshown in Fig. 3. In a superconductor\np (x = \u221e), functions\nf\nand\ng\nare\ngiven\nby\n\u2206\ncos\n\u03b8/\n\u03b52 \u2212 \u220620 cos2 \u03b8 and\n2\n0\np\n2\n2\n2\n\u03b5/ \u03b5 \u2212 \u22060 cos \u03b8, respectively. As shown by black lines\nin Fig.3(d), (f), (g) and (i), the amplitudes of f2 and g\nbecome large along the directions \u03b8 = cos\u22121 (\u03b5/\u22060 ). At\n\u03b5 = 0 and x = 0, formation of a mid-gap Andreev resonant state [12, 13] significantly enhances the amplitudes\nof f1 and \u03c1L compared to that of f2 as shown by red\nlines in Fig.3(a), (b), and (c). For \u03b5 = 0 and \u03b5 = 0.1\u22060 ,\nthe shapes of f1 and \u03c1L at the N/S interface are similar\nto those in s-wave superconductor junctions (red lines in\nFig.3(b), (c), (e) and (f)]. The shape of f1 and f2 in the\nN region is rather complex too. At \u03b5 = 0.5\u22060 , f1 , f2\nand \u03c1L also exhibit the butterfly-like patterns as shown\nby red lines in Fig.3(g), (h), and (i). Similar to s-wave\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) The results for px -wave symmetry. The\nnotations are the same as in Fig. 2.\n\ncase, functions f1 and f2 in N have a complex line shapes\nwith many spikes. The butterfly-like pattern in angle resolved local density of states could be observed through\nthe LDOS in magnetic fields.\nHere, we propose an experimental setup of scanning\ntunneling spectroscopy (STS) in the presence of the magnetic field. As shown in Fig. 1, magnetic field is applied parallel to the N/S plane. Tunneling current at a\nfixed bias voltage is measured as a function of the angle \u03c6 between the x axis and the direction of magnetic\nfield. The vector potential in this configuration is given\nby (Ax , Ay ) = \u2212\u03bbH exp(\u2212z/\u03bb)(sin \u03c6, cos \u03c6) [14, 15]. We\nassume that thickness of a quasi two-dimensional superconductor is sufficiently small compared to the magnetic field penetration depth \u03bb. Magnetic field shifts the\nquasiparticle energy \u03b5 to \u03b5 \u2212 H\u22060 sin(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03b8)/B0 where\nB0 = h/(2e\u03c0 2 \u03be\u03bb) and \u03be = h\u0304vF /\u03c0\u22060 . For typical values\nof \u03be \u223c \u03bb \u223c 100nm, the magnitude of B0 is of the order of 0.02Tesla. Local density of state observed in STS\nR 3\u03c0/2\nexperiments is given by, \u03c1(\u03c6) = \u2212\u03c0/2 \u03c1L (\u03b8, \u03c6)d\u03b8.\nIn Fig. 4, \u03c1 is plotted as a function of \u03c6. For \u03b5 = 0,\n\u22060 H/B0 gives the effective energy of a quasiparticle. In\nan s-wave superconductor, it is evident that \u03c1 is independent of \u03c6 and the amplitude of LDOS is vanishingly small,\nsee curve A in Fig. 4(a). In a px -wave superconductor,\n\n\f4\nmore clear at \u03b5 = 0.5\u22060 . As shown by curves C in Figs.\n4(c) and (d), the period of oscillations becomes shorter\nthan that in Figs. 4(a) and (b), reflecting the butterflylike patterns in Figs. 2(i) and Figs. 3(i). At the same\ntime, the magnitude of the oscillations at \u03b5 = 0.5\u22060 becomes smaller than that at \u03b5 = 0, since the integration\nwith respect to \u03b8 averages the butterfly-like pattern in\n\u03c1L . The discussed features in LDOS at the N/S interface\ndiffer strongly from those in a bulk superconductor. We\nconclude that STS experiments in magnetic field should\nresolve the remarkable deformation of Cooper pairs.\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Magneto-tunneling conductance as a\nfunction of the orientation angle of magnetic field \u03c6 in a spinsinglet s-wave junction [(a) and (c)] and in a spin-triplet px wave one [(b) and (d)]. \u03b5 = 0 in the cases (a) (b) and \u03b5 =\n0.5\u22060 in the cases (c), (d). A: x = \u221e (in a superconductor)\nfor H = 0.1B0 , B: x = 0 (at N/S interface) for H = 0.05B0 ,\nand C: x = 0 for H = 0.1B0 .\n\nas shown by curve A in Fig. 4(b), \u03c1 depends slightly on\n\u03c6 due to quasiparticle excitations near the nodal points\nat the Fermi surface [16]. At the N/S interface, \u03c1 in the\ns-wave case has minima at \u03c6 = \u03c0/2 and 3\u03c0/2 and maxima at \u03c6 = 0 and \u03c0, as shown by curve B in Fig. 4(a).\nOn the other hand, in the px -wave case, \u03c1 has maxima\nat \u03c6 = \u03c0/2 and 3\u03c0/2, see curve B in Fig. 4(b). This\nbehavior can be explained in the following way. Eq. (5)\nyields approximate expression for \u03c1 at H \u226a B0\n\u03c1\u223c\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0/2\n\n\u2212\u03c0/2\n\n2(1 \u2212 a2 ) d\u03b8\n,\n1 + a2 \u00b1 2a cos[C sin(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03c6)/ cos \u03b8]\n\n(6)\n\nwhere a = exp(\u22124L\u03b40 /h\u0304|vF x |), C = 4LH/h\u0304|vF x |, and\nthe sign in the denominator is + (\u2212) for s-wave (px -wave)\njunctions. We note that a is a positive number almost\nindependent of \u03b8 and C is a small positive number. For\n\u03c6 = n\u03c0 + \u03c0/2 with integer n, the magnitude of the argument of cosine function in the denominator becomes\nsmall and the denominator is reduced to (1 \u00b1 a)2 for swave (px -wave) case. When \u03c6 deviates from n\u03c0 + \u03c0/2,\nthe cosine function decreases and therefore \u03c1 has a dip\n(peak) at \u03c6 = \u03c0/2 and 3\u03c0/2 for s-wave (px -wave) cases\nas shown by curve B in Fig. 4(a) ((b)). Similar argument\nalso explains the maximum (minimum) of \u03c1 at \u03c6 = n\u03c0\nin s-wave (px -wave) junctions. When the field H is increases further (curves C in Figs.4(a) and (b)), the shape\nof the \u03c1 exhibits more complex behavior reflecting the\nbutterfly-like pattern of \u03c1L shown in Figs. 2 and 3, because the increase of H has qualitatively similar effect as\nthe increase of \u03b5.\nThe complicated oscillating features are seen much\n\nIn summary, we have studied the Cooper pair shape\nin normal-metal/superconductor (N/S) junctions by using the quasiclassical Green's function formalism. The\nquasiparticle interference leads to striking deformations\nin the shape of a Cooper pair wave function in a normal\nmetal. As a consequence, the angle resolved local density of states exhibits the butterfly-like patterns. We also\nshow that the anisotropic shape of Cooper pairs could be\nresolved by scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments\nin magnetic field. The Cooper pair deformation is a common feature of non-uniform superconducting systems in\nthe clean limit. This provides a key concept to explore\nnew quantum interference phenomena in superconducting nanostructures.\n\n[1] de Gennes Superconductivity of Metal and Alloys, W.A.\nBenjamin, Inc.
