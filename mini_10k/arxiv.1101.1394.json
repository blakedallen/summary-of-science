Introduction\nThroughout this article, we work over C, the complex number field.\nWe will make use of the standard notation and definitions as in [KM]\nand [KMM]. The minimal model conjecture for smooth varieties is the\nfollowing:\nConjecture 1.1 (Minimal model conjecture). Let X be a smooth projective variety. Then there exists a minimal model or a Mori fiber space\nof X.\nThis conjecture is true in dimension 3 and 4 by Kawamata, Koll\u00e1r,\nMori, Shokurov and Reid (cf. [KMM], [KM] and [Sho2]). In the case\nwhere KX is numerically equivalent to some effective divisor in dimension 5, this conjecture is proved by Birkar (cf. [Bi1]). When X is\nof general type or KX is not pseudo-effective, Birkar, Cascini, Hacon\nDate: 2011/5/24, version 6.04.\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. 14E30.\nKey words and phrases. minimal model, the abundance conjecture, numerical\nKodaira dimension.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nYOSHINORI GONGYO\n\nand Mc Kernan prove Conjecture 1.1 in arbitrary dimension ([BCHM]).\nMoreover if X has maximal Albanese dimension, Conjecture 1.1 is true\nby [F2]. In this article, among other things, we consider Conjecture 1.1\nin the case \u03bd(KX ) = 0 (for the definition of \u03bd, see Definition 2.5):\nTheorem 1.2. Let (X, \u2206) be a projective Q-factorial dlt pair such\nthat \u03bd(KX + \u2206) = 0. Then there exists a minimal model (Xm , \u2206m ) of\n(X, \u2206).\nActually the author heared from Vladimir Lazi\u0107 that Theorem 1.2\nfor klt pairs has been proved by Druel (cf. [D] ) after he finished\nthis work. In this article, moreover, we give the generalization of his\nresult for dlt pairs by using the sophisticated Birkar\u2013Cascini\u2013Hacon\u2013\nMc Kernan's results and Druel's method. Essentially our method seems\nto be same as Druel's. However, by expanding this result to dlt pairs\nwe give the different proof of the abundance theorem for log canonical\npairs in the case \u03bd = 0 as shown by [CKP] and [Ka2]:\nTheorem 1.3 (=Theorem 6.1). Let X be a normal projective variety\nand \u2206 an effective Q-divisor. Suppose that (X, \u2206) is a log canonial pair\nsuch that \u03bd(KX +\u2206) = 0. Then KX +\u2206 is abundant, i.e. \u03bd(KX +\u2206) =\n\u03ba(KX + \u2206).\nFor the first time, Nakayama proved Theorem 1.3 when (X, \u2206) is\nklt. Nakayama's proof is independent of Simpson's results [Sim]. Simpson's results are used to approach the abundance conjecture in [CPT].\nCampana\u2013Perternell\u2013Toma prove Theorem 1.3 when X is smooth and\n\u2206 = 0. Siu also gave an analytic proof of it (cf. [Siu]). The results\nof [CKP], [Ka2] and [Siu] depend on [Sim] and [Bu]. In this article,\nwe show Theorem 1.3 by using a method different from [CPT], [CKP],\n[Ka2] and [Siu]. In our proof of Theorem 1.3, we do not need results\nof [Sim] and [Bu]. Our proof depends on [BCHM] and [G].\nWe summarize the contents of this article. In Section 2, we define the\nKodaira dimension and the numerical Kodaira dimension, and collect\nsome properties of these. In Section 3, we review a log minimal model\nprogram with scaling and works of Birkar\u2013Cascini\u2013Hacon\u2013Mc Kernan.\nIn Section 4, we introduce the divisorial Zariski decomposition and\ncollect some properties of it. Section 5 is devoted to the proof of the\nexistence of minimal models in the case \u03bd = 0. In Section 6, we prove\nTheorem 1.3.\nNotation and Definition 1.4. Let K be the real number field R or\nthe rational number field Q. We set K>0 = {x \u2208 K|x > 0}.\nLet X be a normal variety and let \u2206 be an effective K-divisor\nsuch that KX + \u2206 is K-Cartier. Then we can define the discrepancy\n\n\fON THE MINIMAL MODEL THEORY IN THE CASE \u03bd = 0\n\n3\n\na(E, X, \u2206) \u2208 K for every prime divisor E over X. If a(E, X, \u2206) \u2265\n\u22121 (resp. > \u22121) for every E, then (X, \u2206) is called log canonical\n(resp. kawamata log terminal). We sometimes abbreviate log canonical (resp. kawamata log terminal) to lc (resp. klt).\nAssume that (X, \u2206) is log canonical. If E is a prime divisor over X\nsuch that a(E, X, \u2206) = \u22121, then cX (E) is called a log canonical center\n(lc center, for short) of (X, \u2206), where cX (E) is the closure of the image\nof E on X. For the basic properties of log canonical centers, see [F1,\nSection 9].\nLet \u03c0 : X \u2192 S be a projective morphism of normal quasi-projective\nvarieties and D a Z-Cartier divisor on X. We set the complete linear\nsystem |D/S| = {E|D \u223cZ,S E \u2265 0} of D over S. The base locus of\nthe linear system |D/S| is denoted by Bs|D/S|. When S = Spec C, we\ndenote simply |D| and Bs|D|.\nAcknowledgments. The author wishes to express his deep gratitude\nto Professor Osamu Fujino for various comments and discussions.

[N, II, 3.2, Definition]).\nLet X be a normal projective variety and D an R-Cartier divisor on\nX. If |xmDy| =\n6 \u2205, we put a dominant rational map\n\u03c6|xmDy| : X 99K Wm ,\nwith respect to the complete linear system of xmDy. We define the\nClassical Iitaka dimension \u03ba(D) of D as the following:\n\u03ba(D) = max{dimWm }\n\n\f4\n\nYOSHINORI GONGYO\n\nif H 0 (X, xmDy) 6= 0 for some positive integer m and \u03ba(D) = \u2212\u221e\notherwise.\nLemma 2.2. Let Y be a normal projective variety, \u03c6 : Y \u2192 X a\nprojective birational morphism onto a normal projective variety, and\nlet D be an R-Cartier divisor on X. Then it holds the following:\n(1) \u03ba(\u03c6\u2217 D) = \u03ba(\u03c6\u2217 D + E) for any \u03c6-exceptional effective R-divisor\nE, and\n(2) \u03ba(\u03c6\u2217 D) = \u03ba(D).\nProof. (1) and (2) follows from [N, II, 3.11, Lemma].\n\u0003\nThe following is remarked by Shokurov:\nRemark 2.3. In general, \u03ba(D) may not coincide with \u03ba(D \u2032 ) if D \u223cR\nD \u2032 . For example, let X be the P1 , P and Q closed points in X such that\nP 6= Q and a irrational number. Set D = a(P \u2212 Q). Then \u03ba(D) = \u2212\u221e\nin spite of the fact that D \u223cR 0.\nHowever, fortunately, \u03ba(D) coincides with \u03ba(D \u2032 ) if D and D \u2032 are\neffective divisors such that D \u223cR D \u2032 ([Ch, Corollary 2.1.4]). Hence it\nseems reasonable that we define the following as the Iitaka (Kodaira)\ndimension for R-divisors.\nDefinition 2.4 (Invariant Iitaka dimension, [Ch, Definition 2.2.1], cf.\n[CS, Section 7]). Let X be a normal projective variety and D an RCartier divisor on X. We define the invariant Iitaka dimension \u03ba(D)\nof D as the following:\nK(D) = \u03ba(D \u2032 )\nif there exists an effective divisor D \u2032 such that D \u223cR D \u2032 and K(D) =\n\u2212\u221e otherwise. Let (X, \u2206) be a log canonical. Then we call K(KX +\u2206)\nthe log Kodaira dimension of (X, \u2206).\nDefinition 2.5 (Numerical Iitaka dimension). Let X be a normal projective variety, D an R-Cartier divisor and A an ample Cartier divisor\non X. We set\n\u03c3(D, A) = max{k \u2208 Z\u22650 | lim sup m\u2212k dimH 0 (X, xmDy + A) > 0}\nm\u2192\u221e\n0\n\nif H (X, xmDy+A) 6= 0 for infinitely many m \u2208 N and \u03c3(D, A) = \u2212\u221e\notherwise. We define\n\u03bd(D) = max{\u03c3(D, A)|A is a ample divisor on Y }.\n\n\fON THE MINIMAL MODEL THEORY IN THE CASE \u03bd = 0\n\n5\n\nLet (X, \u2206) be a log pair. Then we call \u03bd(KX + \u2206) the numerical log\nKodaira dimension of (X, \u2206). If \u2206 = 0, we simply say \u03bd(KX ) is the\nnumerical Kodaira dimension of X.\nLemma 2.6. Let Y be a normal projective variety, \u03c6 : Y \u2192 X a\nprojective birational morphism onto a normal projective variety, and\nlet D be an R-Cartier divisor on X. Then it holds the following:\n(1) \u03bd(\u03c6\u2217 D) = \u03bd(\u03c6\u2217 D + E) for any \u03c6-exceptional effective R-divisor\nE,\n(2) \u03bd(\u03c6\u2217 D) = \u03bd(D), and\n(3) \u03bd(D) = max{k \u2208 Z\u22650 |D k 6\u2261 0} when D is nef.\nProof. See [N, V, 2.7, Proposition].\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 2.7 ([N, V, 2.7, Proposition, (1)]). Let X be a projective variety and D and D \u2032 R-Cartier divisors on X such that D \u2261 D \u2032 . Then\n\u03bd(D) = \u03bd(D \u2032 ).\nRemark 2.8. \u03bd(D) is denoted as \u03ba\u03c3 (D) in [N, V, \u00a7 2]. Moreover\n+\nNakayama also defined \u03ba\u2212\n\u03c3 (D), \u03ba\u03c3 (D) and \u03ba\u03bd (D) as some numerical\nIitaka dimensions. In this article we mainly treat in the case where\n+\n\u03bd(D) = 0, i.e. \u03ba\u03c3 (D) = 0. Then it holds that \u03ba\u2212\n\u03c3 (D) = \u03ba\u03c3 (D) =\n\u03ba\u03bd (D) = 0 (cf. [N, V, 2.7, Proposition (8)]). Moreover, if a log\ncanonical pair (X, \u2206) has a weakly log canonical model in the sense\nof Shokurov, then \u03bd(KX + \u2206) coincides with the numerical log Kodaira dimension in the sense of Shokurov by Lemma 2.6 (cf. [Sho1,\n2.4, Proposition]).\nDefinition 2.9. Let \u03c0 : X \u2192 S be a projective morphism of normal\nquasi-projective varieties and D an R-Cartier divisor on X. We set\n\\\nB\u2261 (D/S) =\nSupp E.\nD\u2261S E\u22650\n\nWhen S = Spec C, we denote simply B\u2261 (D).\nWe introduce a dlt blow-up. The following theorem was originally\nproved by Professor Christopher Hacon (cf. [F1, Theorem 10.4], [KK,\nTheorem 3.1]). For a simpler proof, see [F3, Section 4]:\nTheorem 2.10 (Dlt blow-up). Let X be a normal quasi-projective variety and \u2206 an effective R-divisor on X such that KX +\u2206 is R-Cartier.\nSuppose that (X, \u2206) is log canonical. Then there exists a projective birational morphism \u03c6 : Y \u2192 X from a normal quasi-projective variety\nwith the following properties:\n(i) Y is Q-factorial,\n\n\f6\n\nYOSHINORI GONGYO\n\n(ii) a(E, X, \u2206) = \u22121 for every \u03c6-exceptional divisor E on Y , and\n(iii) for\nX\n\u0393 = \u03c6\u22121\n\u2206\n+\nE,\n\u2217\nE:\u03c6-exceptional\n\nit holds that (Y, \u0393) is dlt and KY + \u0393 = \u03c6\u2217 (KX + \u2206).\nThe above theorem is very useful for studying log canonical singularities (cf. [F1], [G], [KK]).\n3. Log minimal model program with scaling\nIn this section, we review a log minimal model program with scaling\nand introduce works by Birkar\u2013Cascini\u2013Hacon\u2013Mc Kernan.\nLemma 3.1 (cf. [Bi1, Lemma 2.1] and [F1, Theorem 18.9]). Let \u03c0 :\nX \u2192 S be a projective morphism of normal quasi-projective varieties\nand (X, \u2206) a Q-factorial projective log canonical pair such that \u2206 is a\nK-divisor. Let H be an effective Q-divisor such that KX + \u2206 + H is\n\u03c0-nef and (X, \u2206 + H) is log canonical. Suppose that KX + \u2206 is not\n\u03c0-nef. We put\n\u03bb = inf{\u03b1 \u2208 R\u22650 |KX + \u2206 + \u03b1H is \u03c0-nef}.\nThen \u03bb \u2208 K>0 and there exists an extremal ray R \u2286 NE(X/S) such\nthat (KX + \u2206).R < 0 and (KX + \u2206 + \u03bbH).R = 0.\nDefinition 3.2 (Log minimal model program with scaling). Let \u03c0 :\nX \u2192 S be a projective morphism of normal quasi-projective varieties\nand (X, \u2206) a Q-factorial projective divisorial log terminal pair such\nthat \u2206 is a K-divisor. Let H be an effective K-divisor such that KX +\n\u2206 + H is \u03c0-nef and (X, \u2206 + H) is divisorial log terminal. We put\n\u03bb1 = inf{\u03b1 \u2208 R\u22650 |KX + \u2206 + \u03b1H is \u03c0-nef}.\nIf KX + \u2206 is not \u03c0-nef, then \u03bb1 > 0. By Lemma 3.1, there exists an\nextremal ray R1 \u2286 NE(X/S) such that (KX + \u2206).R1 < 0 and (KX +\n\u2206 + \u03bb1 H).R1 = 0. We consider an extremal contraction with respect\nto this R1 . If it is a divisorial contraction or a flipping contraction, let\n(X, \u2206) 99K (X1 , \u22061 )\nbe the divisorial contraction or its flip. Since KX1 + \u22061 + \u03bb1 H1 is \u03c0-nef,\nwe put\n\u03bb2 = inf{\u03b1 \u2208 R\u22650 |KX1 + \u22061 + \u03b1H1 is \u03c0-nef},\nwhere H1 is the strict transform of H on X1 . Then we find an extremal\nray R2 by the same way as the above. We may repeat the process. We\n\n\fON THE MINIMAL MODEL THEORY IN THE CASE \u03bd = 0\n\n7\n\ncall this program a log minimal model program with scaling of H over\nS. When this program runs as the following:\n(X0 , \u22060 ) = (X, \u2206) 99K (X1 , \u22061 ) 99K * * * 99K (Xi , \u2206i ) * * * ,\nthen\n\u03bb1 \u2265 \u03bb2 \u2265 \u03bb3 . . . ,\nwhere \u03bbi = inf{\u03b1 \u2208 R\u22650 |KXi\u22121 + \u2206i\u22121 + \u03b1Hi\u22121 is \u03c0-nef} and Hi\u22121 is\nthe strict transform of H on Xi\u22121 .\nThe following theorems are slight generalizations of [BCHM, Corollary 1.4.1] and [BCHM, Corollary 1.4.2]. These seem to be well-known\nfor the experts.\nTheorem 3.3 (cf. [BCHM, Corollary 1.4.1]). Let \u03c0 : X \u2192 S be a\nprojective morphism of normal quasi-projective varieties and (X, \u2206) be\na Q-factorial projective divisorial log terminal pair such that \u2206 is an\nR-divisor. Suppose that \u03c6 : X \u2192 Y is a flipping contraction of (X, \u2206).\nThen there exists the log flip of \u03c6.\nProof. Since \u2212(KX + \u2206) is \u03c6-ample, so is \u2212(KX + \u2206 \u2212 \u01ebx\u2206y) for a\nsufficiently small \u01eb > 0. Because \u03c1(X/Y ) = 1, it holds that KX +\n\u2206 \u223cR,Y c(KX + \u2206 \u2212 \u01ebx\u2206y) for some positive number c. By [BCHM,\nCorollary 1.4.1], there exists the log flip of (X, \u2206 \u2212 \u01ebx\u2206y). This log flip\nis also the log flip of (X, \u2206) since KX + \u2206 \u223cR,Y c(KX + \u2206 \u2212 \u01ebx\u2206y).\n\u0003\nTheorem 3.4 (cf. [BCHM, Corollary 1.4.2]). Let \u03c0 : X \u2192 S be a\nprojective morphism of normal quasi-projective varieties and (X, \u2206) be\na Q-factorial projective divisorial log terminal pair such that \u2206 is an\nR-divisor. Suppose that there exists a \u03c0-ample R-divisor A on X such\nthat \u2206 \u2265 A. Then any sequences of log minimal model program starting\nfrom (X, \u2206) with scaling of H over S terminate, where H satisfies that\n(X, \u2206 + H) is divisorial log terminal and KX + \u2206 + H is \u03c0-nef.\nThe above theorem is proved by the same argument as the proof\nof [BCHM, Corollary1.4.2] because [BCHM, Theorem E] holds on the\nabove setting.\n4. Divisorial Zariski decomposition\nIn this section, we introduce the divisorial Zariski decomposition for\na pseudo-effective divisor.\nDefinition 4.1 (cf. [N, III, 1.13, Definition] and [Ka1]). Let \u03c0 : X \u2192 S\nbe a projective morphism of normal quasi-projective varieties and D an\nR-Cartier divisor. We call that D is a limit of movable R-divisors over\n\n\f8\n\nYOSHINORI GONGYO\n\nS if [D] \u2208 Mov(X/S) \u2286 N 1 (X/S) where Mov(X/S) is the closure of\nthe convex cone spanned by classes of fixed part free Z-Cartier divisors\nover S. When S = Spec C, we denote simply Mov(X).\nDefinition 4.2 (cf. [N, III, 1.6, Definition and 1.12, Definition]). Let\nX be a smooth projective variety and B a big R divisor. We define\n\u03c3\u0393 (B) = inf{mult\u0393 B \u2032 |B \u2261 B \u2032 \u2265 0}\nfor a prime divisor \u0393. Let D be a pseudo-effective divisor. Then we\ndefine the following:\n\u03c3\u0393 (D) = lim \u03c3\u0393 (D + \u01ebA)\n\u01eb\u21920+\n\nfor some ample divisor A. We remark that \u03c3\u0393 (D) is independent of\nthe choice of A. Moreover the above two definitions coincide for a\nbig divisor because a function \u03c3\u0393 (*) on Big(X) is continuous where\nBig(X) := {[B] \u2208 N1 (X)|B is big} (cf. [N, III, 1.7, Lemma]). We set\nX\nN(D) =\n\u03c3\u0393 (D)\u0393 and P (D) = D \u2212 N(D).\n\u0393:prime divisor\n\nWe remark that N(D) is a finite sum. We call the decomposition\nD = P (D) + N(D) the divisorial Zariski decomposition of D. We say\nthat P (D) (resp. N(D)) is the positive part (resp. negative part) of D.\nRemark that the decomposition D \u2261 P (D) + N(D) is called several\nnames: the sectional decomposition ([Ka1]), the \u03c3-decomposition ([N]),\nthe divisorial Zariski decomposition ([Bo]), and the numerical Zariski\ndecomposition ([Ka2]).\nProposition 4.3. Let X be a smooth projective variety and D a pseudoeffective R-divisor on X. Then it holds the following:\n(1) \u03c3\u0393 (D) = lim\u01eb\u21920+ \u03c3\u0393 (D + \u01ebE) for a pseudo-effective divisor E,\nand\n(2) \u03bd(D) = 0 if and only if D \u2261 N(D).\nProof. (1) follows from [N, III, 1.4, Lemma]. (2) follows from [N, V,\n2.7, Proposition (8)].\n\u0003\n5. Existence of minimal models in the case \u03bd = 0\nTheorem 5.1 (cf. [D, Corollaire 3.4]). Let X be a Q-factorial projective variety and \u2206 an effective R-divisor such that (X, \u2206) is divisorial\nlog terminal. Suppose that \u03bd(KX +\u2206) = 0. Then any log minimal model\nprograms starting from (X, \u2206) with scaling of H terminate, where H\nsatisfies that H \u2265 A for some effective R-ample divisor A, (X, \u2206 + H)\nis divisorial log terminal, and KX + \u2206 + H is nef.\n\n\fON THE MINIMAL MODEL THEORY IN THE CASE \u03bd = 0\n\n9\n\nProof. Let (X, \u2206) 99K (X1 , \u22061 ) be a divisorial contraction or a log flip.\nRemark that it holds that\n\u03bd(KX + \u2206) = \u03bd(KX1 + \u22061 )\nfrom Lemma 2.6 (1) and the negativity lemma. Now we run a log\nminimal model program\n(Xi , \u2206i ) 99K (Xi+1 , \u2206i+1 )\nstarting from (X0 , \u22060 ) = (X, \u2206) with scaling of H. Assume by contradiction that this program does not terminate. Let {\u03bbi } be as in\nDefinition 3.2. We set\n\u03bb = lim \u03bbi .\ni\u2192\u221e\n\nIf \u03bb 6= 0, the sequence is composed by (KX + \u2206 + 21 \u03bbH)-log minimal model program. Thus the sequence terminates by Theorem 3.4.\nTherefore we see that \u03bb = 0. Now there exists j such that (Xi , \u2206i ) 99K\n(Xi+1 , \u2206i+1 ) is a log flip for any i \u2265 j. Replace (X, \u2206) by (Xj , \u2206j ), we\nlose the fact that A is ample. Then we see the following:\nClaim 5.2. KX + \u2206 is a limit of movable R-divisors.\nProof of Claim 5.2. See [Bi2, Step 2 of the proof of Theorem 1.5] or\n[F3, Theorem 2.3].\n\u0003\nLet \u03c6 : Y \u2192 X be a log resolution of (X, \u2206). We consider the\ndivisorial Zariski decomposition\n\u03c6\u2217 (KX + \u2206) = P (\u03c6\u2217(KX + \u2206)) + N(\u03c6\u2217 (KX + \u2206))\n(Definition 4.2). Since\n\u03bd(\u03c6\u2217 (KX + \u2206)) = \u03bd(KX + \u2206) = 0,\nwe see P (\u03c6\u2217 (KX + \u2206)) \u2261 0 by Proposition 4.3 (2). Moreover we see\nthe following claim:\nClaim 5.3. N(\u03c6\u2217 (KX + \u2206)) is a \u03c6-exceptional divisor.\nProof of Claim 5.3. Let G be an ample divisor on X and \u01eb a sufficiently\nsmall positive number. By Proposition 4.3 (1), it holds that\nSupp N(\u03c6\u2217 (KX + \u2206)) \u2286 Supp N(\u03c6\u2217 (KX + \u2206 + \u01ebG)).\nIf it holds that \u03c6\u2217 (N(\u03c6\u2217 (KX + \u2206))) 6= 0, we see that B\u2261 (KX + \u2206 + \u01ebG)\nhas codimension 1 components. This is a contradiction to Claim 5.2.\nThus N(\u03c6\u2217 (KX + \u2206)) is a \u03c6-exceptional divisor.\n\u0003\nHence KX + \u2206 \u2261 0, in particular, KX + \u2206 is nef. This is a contradiction to the assumption.\n\u0003\n\n\f10\n\nYOSHINORI GONGYO\n\nCorollary 5.4. Let X be a Q-factorial projective variety and \u2206 an\neffective R-divisor such that (X, \u2206) is divisorial log terminal. Suppose\nthat \u03bd(KX + \u2206) = 0. Then there exists a log minimal model of (X, \u2206).\nRemark 5.5. These results are on the absolute setting. It may be\ndifficult to extends these to the relative settings. See [F3].\n6. Abundance theorem in the case \u03bd = 0\nIn this section, we prove the abundance theorem in the case where\n\u03bd = 0 for an R-divisor:\nTheorem 6.1. Let X be a normal projective variety and \u2206 an effective\nR-divisor. Suppose that (X, \u2206) is a log canonical pair such that \u03bd(KX +\n\u2206) = 0. Then \u03bd(KX +\u2206) = K(KX +\u2206). Moreover, if \u2206 is a Q-divisor,\nthen \u03bd(KX + \u2206) = \u03ba(KX + \u2206) = K(KX + \u2206).\nFirst we extends [G, Theorem 1.2] to an R-divisor.\nLemma 6.2 (cf. [FG, Theorem 3.1]). Let X be a normal projective\nvariety and \u2206 an effective K-divisor. Suppose that (X, \u2206) is a log\ncanonical pair such that KX + \u2206 \u2261 0. Then KX + \u2206 \u223cK 0\nProof. By taking a dlt blow-up (Theorem 2.10), we may assume that\n(X, \u2206) is a Q-factorial dlt pair. If K = Q, then the statement is nothing\nP\nbut [G, Theorem 1.2]. From now on, we assume that K = L\nR. Let i Bi\nbe the irreducible decomposition of Supp \u2206. We put V = RBi . Then\ni\n\nit is well known that\nL = {B \u2208 V | (X, B) is log canonical}\nis a rational polytope in V . We can also check that\nN = {B \u2208 L | KX + B is nef}\n\nis a rational polytope and \u2206 \u2208 N (cf. [Bi2, Proposition 3.2] and [Sho1,\n6.2 First Main theorem]). We note that N is known as Shokurov's\npolytope. Therefore, we can write\nKX + \u2206 =\n\nk\nX\n\nri (KX + \u2206i )\n\ni=1\n\nsuch that\n(i) \u2206i is an effective Q-divisor such that \u2206i \u2208 N for every i,\n(ii) (X, \u2206i ) is log canonical for every i, and\nP\n(iii) 0 < ri < 1, ri \u2208 R for every i, and ki=1 ri = 1.\n\n\fON THE MINIMAL MODEL THEORY IN THE CASE \u03bd = 0\n\n11\n\nSince KX + \u2206 is numerically trivial and KX + \u2206i is nef for every i,\nKX + \u2206i is numerically trivial for every i. By [G, Theorem 1.2], we see\nthat KX + \u2206 \u223cR 0.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 6.1. By taking a dlt blow-up (Theorem 2.10), we\nmay assume that (X, \u2206) is a Q-factorial dlt pair. By Corollary 5.4,\nthere exists a log minimal model (Xm , \u2206m ) of (X, \u2206). From Lemma\n2.6 (3), it holds that KXm + \u2206m \u2261 0. By Lemma 6.2, it holds that\nK(KXm + \u2206m ) = 0. Lemma 2.2 implies that K(KX + \u2206) = 0. If\n\u2206 is a Q-divisor, then there exists an effective Q-divisor E such that\nKX + \u2206 \u223cQ E by Corollary 5.4 and Lemma 6.2. Thus we see that\n\u03ba(KX + \u2206) = K(KX + \u2206). We finish the proof of Theorem 6.1.\n\u0003\nCorollary 6.3. Let \u03c0 : X \u2192 S be a projective surjective morphism\nof normal quasi-projective varieties, and let (X, \u2206) be a projective log\ncanonical pair such that \u2206 is an effective K-divisor. Suppose that\n\u03bd(KF + \u2206F ) = 0 for a general fiber F , where KF + \u2206F = (KX + \u2206)|F .\nThen there exists an effective K-divisor D such that KX + \u2206 \u223cK,\u03c0 D.\nProof.
