These are scenarios with\nlarge tan \u03b2, with non-universal soft supersymmetry-breaking terms, with multi-TeV masses\nfor scalar superpartners known as 'focus point' supersymmetry, and finally scenarios with\nintermediate unification scale which appear naturally in some superstring constructions.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nOne of the strongest motivations for physics beyond the standard model is the existence of dark matter. Substantial evidences exist suggesting that most of the mass\nin the Universe is some non-luminous matter, the so called 'dark matter', of as yet\nunknown composition. Currently the most convincing observational evidence for the\nexistence of dark matter comes from the analysis of rotation curves of spiral Galaxies,\ni.e., measurements of the velocity of isolated stars or gas clouds which orbit in the\nouter parts of spiral Galaxies. It has been noted that there is not enough luminous\nmatter in those Galaxies to account for their observed rotation curves [1].\nThe detailed analysis of rotation curves offers convincing evidence that 90% or\nmore of the mass of the Galaxies is dark. Other evidences arise from large scale\nmeasurements, as e.g. the motions of cluster members Galaxies. A key question is\nExtension of a talk given at Cairo International Conference on High Energy Physics (CICHEP\n2001), January 9-14.\n\u2217\n\n1\n\n\fthen, what could this dark matter be? We don't know the answer yet, but we do know\nthat not all of it can be ordinary (baryonic) matter, since measured abundances of\nhelium, deuterium and lithium in the scenario of big-bang nucleosynthesis impose a\nstrong upper bound on the baryon density in the Universe. This density is too small\nto account for the whole dark matter in the Universe. The conclusion is that baryonic\nobjects, such as e.g. MACHOs, can be components of the dark matter, but more\ncandidates are needed [2].\nFortunately, particle physics offers various candidates for (non-baryonic) dark matter, all of which would indicate new physics beyond the well tested standard model\nof particle physics [3]. For example, long-lived or stable weakly-interacting massive\nparticles (WIMPs) can remain from the earliest moments of the Universe in sufficient\nnumber to account for a significant fraction of relic density. These particles would form\nnot only a background density in the Universe, but also would cluster gravitationally\nwith ordinary stars in the galactic halos.\nThis raises the hope of detecting relic WIMPs directly, by observing their elastic\nscattering on target nuclei through nuclear recoils. Since WIMPs interact with ordinary\nmatter with very roughly weak strength, and assuming that their masses are of the\norder of weak scale (i.e., between 10 GeV and a few TeV), it is natural to expect a\nWIMP-nucleus cross section of the same order as that of a weak process, which is around\n1 pb. This would imply a WIMP-nucleon cross section around 10\u22128 pb, too low to be\ndetected by current dark matter experiments, DAMA, CDMS and UKCDM, which are\nsensitive to a cross section around 10\u22126 pb. Surprisingly, the DAMA collaboration\nreported recently [4] data favouring the existence of a WIMP signal in their search for\nannual modulation. When uncertainties as e.g. the WIMP velocity or possible bulk\nhalo rotation, are included, it was claimed that the preferred range of parameters is (at\n\u22125\n4\u03c3 C.L.) 10\u22126 pb <\n\u223c 200 GeV. Unlike\n\u223cm<\n\u223c 10 pb for a WIMP mass 30 GeV <\n\u223c\u03c3<\nthis spectacular result, the CDMS collaboration claims to have excluded [5] regions of\nthe DAMA parameter space.\nIn any case, due to these and other projected experiments, it seems very plausible\nthat the dark matter will be found in the near future. In this situation, and assuming\nthat the dark matter is a WIMP, it is natural to wonder how big the cross section\nfor its direct detection can be. The answer to this question depends on the particular\nWIMP considered. The leading candidate in this class is the lightest neutralino [6], a\nparticle predicted by the supersymmetric (SUSY) extension of the standard model. In\nthis paper we critically reappraise the known SUSY scenarios based on neutralinos as\ndark-matter candidates, and in particular the scenarios constructed recently in order\nto enhance the neutralino-nucleon cross section. This is the case of scenarios with large\ntan \u03b2 [7]-[9], with non-universal soft SUSY-breaking terms [7, 8, 10], with multi-TeV\nmasses for scalar superpartners known as 'focus point' supersymmetry [11], and finally\nscenarios with intermediate unification scale [12]-[14].\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nSupersymmetric predictions for the neutralino-nucleon cross\nsection\n\nIn SUSY models, R-parity is often imposed to avoid weak scale proton decay or lepton\nnumber violation. Imposing this symmetry yields remarkable phenomenological implications. SUSY particles are produced or destroyed only in pairs and, as a consequence,\nthe lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is absolutely stable. The former implies\nthat a major signature for R-parity conserving models is represented by events with\nmissing energy (for instance, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 jet + missing energy). The latter implies that\nthe LSP might constitute a possible candidate for dark matter. Concerning this point,\nit is remarkable that in most of the parameter space of SUSY models the LSP is an\nelectrically neutral (also with no strong interactions) particle, called neutralino. This\nis welcome since otherwise the LSP would bind to nuclei and would be excluded as a\ncandidate for dark matter from unsuccessful searches for exotic heavy isotopes [15].\nIn the simplest SUSY extension of the standard model, the so-called minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) there are four neutralinos, \u03c7\u03030i (i = 1, 2, 3, 4), since\nthey are the physical superpositions of the fermionic partners of the neutral electroweak\ngauge bosons, called bino (B\u0303 0 ) and wino (W\u030330 ), and of the fermionic partners of the\nneutral Higgs bosons, called Higgsinos (H\u0303u0 , H\u0303d0 ). Therefore the lightest neutralino, \u03c7\u030301 ,\nwill be the dark matter candidate. The neutralino mass matrix with the conventions\nP\nfor gaugino and Higgsino masses in the Lagrangian, L = 12 a Ma \u03bba \u03bba + \u03bcH\u0303u0H\u0303d0 +\nh.c., is given by\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\nM1\n0\n\u2212MZ cos \u03b2 sin \u03b8W\nMZ sin \u03b2 sin \u03b8W\n\n0\nM2\nMZ cos \u03b2 cos \u03b8W\n\u2212MZ sin \u03b2 cos \u03b8W\n\n\u2212MZ cos \u03b2 sin \u03b8W\nMZ cos \u03b2 cos \u03b8W\n0\n\u2212\u03bc\n\nMZ sin \u03b2 sin \u03b8W\n\u2212MZ sin \u03b2 cos \u03b8W\n\u2212\u03bc\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f8\n\n(1)\n\nin the above basis (B\u0303 0 = \u2212i\u03bb\u2032 , W\u030330 = \u2212i\u03bb3 , H\u0303u0 , H\u0303d0 ). Here M1 and M2 are the soft bino\nand wino masses respectively, \u03bc is the Higgsino mass parameter and tan \u03b2 = hHu0 i/hHd0i\nis the ratio of Higgs vacuum expectation values.

For the neutron the value of fs is the same and\ntherefore the scalar cross sections for both, protons and neutrons, are basically equal.\nThe cross section for the elastic scattering of relic neutralinos on protons and neutrons has been examined exhaustively in the literature [6]. This is for example the\ncase in the framework of minimal supergravity (mSUGRA). Let us recall that in this\nframework one makes several assumptions. In particular, the scalar mass parameters,\nthe gaugino mass parameters, and the trilinear couplings, which are generated once\nSUSY is broken through gravitational interactions, are universal at the grand unification scale, MGU T \u2248 2 \u00d7 1016 GeV. They are denoted by m0 , M1/2 , and A0 respectively.\nLikewise, radiative electroweak symmetry breaking is imposed, i.e., |\u03bc| is determined\nby the minimization of the Higgs effective potential.

To understand this result qualitatively, we show\nschematically in Fig. 2 the well known evolution of m2Hd and m2Hu with the scaleb .\nSince m2Hu becomes large and negative (notice also that m2Hd , neglecting bottom and\ntau Yukawa couplings, becomes positive), |\u03bc| due to relation (7) becomes also large,\nin particular much larger than M1 and M2 . Thus, as can be easily understood from\neqs.(1) and (2), the lightest neutralino will be mainly gaugino, and in particular bino\nsince at low energy M1 \u2248 12 M2 .\nWe show this fact in Fig. 3a, where for tan \u03b2 = 3 the gaugino-Higgsino componentssquared N1i2 of the lightest neutralino as a function of its mass m\u03c7\u030301 are exhibited. Here\nwe are using as an example m0 = 150 GeV, and M1/2 is essentially fixed for a given\nm\u03c7\u030301 . Note that N11 is extremely large and therefore P >\n\u223c 0.9. Then, the scattering\nchannels through Higgs exchange shown in Fig. 1 are suppressed (recall that the Higgsneutralino-neutralino couplings are proportional to N13 and N14 ) and therefore the cross\nsection is small. As a matter of fact, the scattering channels through squark exchange,\nshown also in Fig. 1, are also suppressed by the mass of the squarks. Indeed in this\nlimit the cross section (4) can be approximated as\n\u03b12\n2\n4\n\u03c3\u03c7\u030301 \u2212p \u2248 m2r \u0010\n\u00112 fs |N11 | .\n2\n2\nms\u0303 \u2212 m\u03c7\u03030\n\n(8)\n\n1\n\nThus it can be roughly estimated to be \u03c3\u03c7\u030301 \u2212p \u2248 10\u22128 pb, for \u03b1 \u2248 10\u22122 , fs \u2248 10\u22121 ,\nmr \u2248 1 GeV and ms\u0303 \u2248 300 GeV. This is precisely the value of the cross section\nexpected for a weak process as discussed in the Introduction.\nIn Fig. 3b we show the cross section \u03c3\u03c7\u030301 \u2212p as a function of the neutralino mass m\u03c7\u030301\nfor tan \u03b2 = 3.

We will use these\nvalues throughout this reviewd . Likewise we impose the present bounds coming from\naccelerators. These are LEP and Tevatron bounds on SUSY masses and CLEO b \u2192 s\u03b3\nbranching ratio measurements. For the Higgs mass we use the present experimental\nlower limit for tan \u03b2 = 3 [19], i.e. mh > 95 GeV. Although, for the values of tan \u03b2 that\nwe will consider in the next section, tan \u03b2 = 10, this limit is considerably weaker [19],\nmh > 80 GeV, we will still use mh > 95 GeV. Concerning the parameter space of the\nfigure, we have used 30 GeV \u2264 m0 \u2264 550 GeV, where the lower bound is in order to\navoid the stau being the LSP for all values of m\u03c7\u030301 . Note that the curve associated to\nm0 = 550 GeV corresponds to the minimum values of \u03c3\u03c7\u030301 \u2212p in the figure. On the other\nhand, since the cross sections are not very sensitive to the specific values of A0 in a\nwide range (we have checked that this is so for | A0 /M1/2 | <\n\u223c 1), we fix A0 = M1/2 in\nthe figure. As mentioned above the gaugino mass M1/2 is essentially fixed for a given\ntan \u03b2 and m\u03c7\u030301 . For this figure we have to take 140 GeV <\n\u223c 350 GeV, where\n\u223c M1/2 <\nthe lower bound, corresponding to m\u03c7\u030301 \u2265 55 GeV, is due to the experimental bound\non the lightest chargino mass m\u03c7\u0303\u00b11 > 90 GeV. Negative values of M1/2 , not shown in\nthe figure, correspond to smaller cross sections.\n\u22127\nAs we can see in the figure \u03c3\u03c7\u030301 \u2212p <\n\u223c 10 pb, and therefore for these values of the\nparameters we would have to wait in principle for the projected GENIUS detector [20]\nparameter space. In addition, recent measurements of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon\n[18] seems to exclude all cases with \u03bc < 0.\nd\nIt is worth mentioning here that values for the hadronic matrix elements as those discussed in\nfootnote a will increase in one order of magnitude the results of this and the other figures in this\nreview, since their contribution appears raised to the square in eq.(4).\n\n6\n\n\fFigure 4: The same as in Fig. 3b but for tan \u03b2 = 10 and 20.\nto be able to test the neutralino as a dark-matter candidate.\n\n3\n\nLarge neutralino-nucleon cross section in supergravity scenarios\n\nRecently there has been some theoretical activity [7]-[14] trying to obtain regions in the\nparameter space of supergravity (SUGRA) scenarios compatible with the sensitivity\nof current dark matter detectors, DAMA and CDMS. The key point in most of these\nscenarios to carry it out consists of reducing the value of |\u03bc|. Following the discussion\nbelow eq.(7) in the previous section, the smaller |\u03bc| is, the larger the Higgsino components of the lightest neutralino become. Eventually, |\u03bc| will be of the order of M1 ,\nM2 and \u03c7\u030301 will be a mixed Higgsino-gaugino state. Indeed scattering channels through\nHiggs exchange in Fig. 1 are now important and their contributions to the cross section\n(4) can be schematically approximated as\n\u03c3\u03c7\u030301 \u2212p \u2248 m2r\n\n\u03bb2s \u03b1 2\nf |N13 N11 |2 ,\nm4h s\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03bbs is the strange quark Yukawa coupling and mh represent the Higgs masses.\nWith the same rough estimate as in eq.(8), one obtains \u03c3\u03c7\u030301 \u2212p \u2248 10\u22126 pb for mh \u2248 100\nGeV.\nIn this section we review the different SUGRA scenarios that can be found in the\nliterature in order to enhance the neutralino-proton cross section \u03c3\u03c7\u030301 \u2212p to be of the\norder of 10\u22126 pb.\n\n7\n\n\f3.1\n\nScenario with large tan \u03b2\n\nIn the previous section we showed in Fig. 3b the neutralino-proton cross section for\ntan \u03b2 = 3, in the framework of mSUGRA. Here we show the same in Fig. 4 but for\nlarger values of tan \u03b2, in particular for tan \u03b2 = 10 (green points) and 20 (red points).\nWe see that the cross section increases when the value of tan \u03b2 increases. For moderate\nvalues of tan \u03b2, the reason being that the top(bottom) Yukawa coupling which appears\nin the RGE for m2Hu (m2Hd ) decreases(increases) since it is proportional to sin1 \u03b2 ( cos1 \u03b2 ).\nThis implies that the negative(positive) contribution m2Hu (m2Hd ) to \u03bc2 in eq.(7) is less\nimportant, and therefore |\u03bc| decreases.\n2\nstable with respect to variations of\nHowever, for tan \u03b2 >\n\u223c 10, the value of \u03bc is very\n1\n2\n2\ntan \u03b2. This is due to the fact that \u03bc \u2248 \u2212mH2 \u2212 2 MZ2 (see eq.(7)). Since sin \u03b2 \u2248 1, the\ntop Yukawa coupling is stable and therefore the same conclusion is obtained for m2H2\nand \u03bc2 . Thus, the reason for the cross section to increase when tan \u03b2 increases cannot\nbe now the increment of the Higgsino components of the LSP. Nevertheless there is a\nsecond effect in the cross section which is now the dominant one: the contribution of\nthe down-type quark Yukawa couplings (see eq.(9)) which are proportional to cos1 \u03b2 .\nIt was in fact pointed out in refs.[7, 8] that the large tan \u03b2 regime allows regions\nwhere \u03c3\u03c7\u030301 \u2212p \u2248 10\u22126 pb is reached. We can see in Fig. 4 that this is so for tan \u03b2 >\n\u223c 20.\nVery large values of tan \u03b2, like tan \u03b2 \u2243 50 which correspond approximately to the\nunification of the tau and top Yukawa couplings at MGU T , have also been considered [9].\nAlthough it was found, as expected, that the cross section is enhanced, the well known\nexperimental limits coming from b \u2192 s\u03b3 for large tan \u03b2, lead to severe constraints on\n\u22126\nthe parameter space. In particular, these constraints imply \u03c3\u03c7\u030301 \u2212p <\n\u223c 10 pb.\n\n3.2\n\nFocus point supersymmetry scenario\n\nAnother possibility to obtain a large neutralino-nucleon cross section arises in the socalled focus point supersymmetry scenario. This has been proposed [21] in order to\navoid dangerous SUSY contributions to flavour and CP violating effects. The idea is to\nassume the existence of squark and sleptons with masses which can be taken well abovee\n1 TeV. It has also been argued that this situation produces no loss of naturalness.\nThe implications of focus point supersymmetry for neutralino dark matter have\nbeen considered in ref.[11]. In particular, it was pointed out that for m0 > 1 TeV,\nunlike the usual cases with m0 < 1 TeV, the lightest neutralino is a gaugino-Higgsino\nmixture over much of parameter space. Let us recall from the previous subsection that\nfor moderate and large values of tan \u03b2, \u03bc2 in eq.(7) can be approximated as\n1\n\u03bc2 \u2248 \u2212m2Hu \u2212 MZ2 .\n2\n\n(10)\n\nThus for m0 > 1 TeV, m2Hu becomes less negative, and therefore |\u03bc| decreases. (For\ntan \u03b2 < 5, \u03bc becomes sensitive to m2Hd , and as m0 increases |\u03bc| also increases, and\ne\n\nOf course this scenario rules out SUSY as an explanation of the possible deviation in the muon\nanomalous magnetic moment from the standard model prediction [18].\n\n8\n\n\fFigure 5: The same as in Fig. 3b but for tan \u03b2 = 10 and using non-universal soft\nscalar masses as explained in the text. The universal case (green region) is shown for\ncomparison.\nso there is no mixed gaugino-Higgsino region for small tan \u03b2.) However, as discussed\nin ref.[11], one still needs large values for tan \u03b2 (of the order of 50) in order to have\n\u22126\n\u03c3\u03c7\u030301 \u2212p <\n\u223c 10 pb.\n\n3.3\n\nScenario with non-universal soft terms\n\nThe soft SUSY-breaking terms can have in general a non-universal structure in the\nMSSM. Such structure can be derived from SUGRA [22]. For the case of the observable\nscalar masses, this is due to the non-universal couplings in the K\u00e4hler potential between\nthe hidden sector fields breaking SUSY and the observable sector fields. For the case\nof the gaugino masses, this is due to the non-universality of the gauge kinetic functions\nassociated to the different gauge groups. Explicit string constructions, whose lowenergy limit is SUGRA, exhibit these properties [22].\nIt was shown recently, in the context of SUGRA, that non-universality allows to\nincrease [7, 8, 10] the neutralino-proton cross section for moderate values of tan \u03b2. This\ncan be carried out with non-universal scalar masses and/or gaugino masses, as we will\ndiscuss below.\n(i) Non-universal scalar masses\nNon-universality in the Higgs sector, concerning dark matter, was studied in refs.[23,\n24, 7]. Subsequently, non-universality in the sfermion sector was added in the analysis\n[25, 8]. In order to avoid potential problems with flavour changing neutral currents,\nit was assumed that the first two generations of squarks and sleptons have a common\nscalar mass m0 at MGU T , and non-universalities were allowed in the third generation\n9\n\n\fand Higgs sector. Thus the soft masses can be parameterized as follows:\nm2Hd = m20 (1 + \u03b41 ),\nm2QL = m20 (1 + \u03b43 ),\n\nmH2u = m20 (1 + \u03b42 ),\nmu2R = m20 (1 + \u03b44 ),\n\nm2eR = m20 (1 + \u03b45 ),\nm2LL = m20 (1 + \u03b47 ),\n\nmd2R = m20 (1 + \u03b46 ),\n(11)\n\nwhere QL = (t\u0303L , b\u0303L ), LL = (\u03bd\u0303L , \u03c4\u0303L ), uR = t\u0303R , eR = \u03c4\u0303R , and it is assumed that \u22121 \u2264\n\u03b4i \u2264 1.\nAs explained at the beginning of this section 3, \u03bc2 is one of the important parameters when computing the neutralino-nucleon cross section. Its value is determined by\ncondition (7) and can be significantly reduced for some choices of \u03b4's. We can have\na qualitative understanding of the effects of the \u03b4's on \u03bc from the following. First,\nwhen m2Hu (m2Hd ) at MGU T increases(decreases) its negative(positive) contribution at\nlow energy in eq.(7) is less important. Second, when m2QL and m2uR at MGU T decrease,\ndue to their contribution proportional to the top Yukawa coupling in the RGE of m2Hu\nthe negative contribution of the latter to \u03bc2 is again less important. Thus one can\ndeduce that \u03bc2 will be reduced (and hence \u03c3\u03c7\u030301 \u2212p increased) by choosing \u03b43 , \u03b44 , \u03b41 < 0\nand \u03b42 > 0.\nFollowing this analysis [7, 8] we show in Fig. 5, for tan \u03b2 = 10, a scatter plot of\n\u03c3\u03c7\u030301 \u2212p as a function of m\u03c7\u030301 for a scanning of the parameters as follows: 0 \u2264 \u03b42 \u2264 1,\n\u22121 \u2264 \u03b41,3,4 \u2264 0. The other \u03b4 \u2032 s are not so important in the computation and we take\nthem vanishing. We are also taking A = M1/2 , 30 GeV \u2264 m0 \u2264 550 GeV as in Fig. 3b,\nand we have to take now 140 GeV <\n\u223c 450 GeV. For comparison we superimpose\n\u223c M1/2 <\nalso the region (green area) obtained in Fig. 4 for tan \u03b2 = 10 with universality, \u03b4i = 0.\nWe see that non-universal scalar masses can help in increasing the values of \u03c3\u03c7\u030301 \u2212p . In\nfact non-universality in the Higgs sector gives the most important effect, and including\nthe one in the sfermion sector the cross section only increases slightly. Of course, as\ndiscussed in detail in Subsection 3.1, for larger values of tan \u03b2 one can get larger cross\nsections.\n(ii) Non-universal gaugino masses\nThe effects of the non-universality of gaugino masses on dark matter in SUGRA\nscenarios have been studied in ref.[26, 10, 27]. In particular, in ref.[10], the authors\nanalyze in detail the neutralino-proton cross section in the case of SU(5) unified models\nwith interesting results, finding that the cross sections can increase.\nHere we are interested in the case of the standard model gauge group in order to\ncompare our results with both, the universal case discussed in Sections 2 and 3.1 and\nthe case with non-universal scalar masses discussed above. Let us then parameterize\nthe soft gaugino masses at MGU T as follows:\nM1 = M1/2 (1 + \u03b41\u2032 ),\n\nM2 = M1/2 (1 + \u03b42\u2032 ),\n\nM3 = M1/2 (1 + \u03b43\u2032 ) ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere M1,2,3 are the bino, wino and gluino masses, respectively, and we assume that\n\u22121 \u2264 \u03b4i\u2032 \u2264 1.\n10\n\n\fFigure 6: The same as in Fig. 3b but only for tan \u03b2 = 10 and using non-universal soft\ngaugino masses as explained in the text. The universal case (green region) is shown\nfor comparison.\nLet us discuss now which values of the parameters are interesting in order to increase\nthe cross section, with respect to the universal case \u03b4i\u2032 = 0. In this sense, it is worth\nnoticing that M3 appears in the RGEs of squark masses, so e.g. their contribution\nproportional to the top Yukawa coupling in the RGE of m2Hu will do this less negative\nif M3 is small. Therefore \u03bc2 becomes smaller.\nTaking into account this effect, we show in Fig. 6, for tan \u03b2 = 10, a scatter plot of\n\u2032\n\u03c3\u03c7\u030301 \u2212p as a function of m\u03c7\u030301 for the following scanning of the parameters: \u22121 \u2264 \u03b41,2\n\u22641\n\u2032\nand \u22122/3 \u2264 \u03b43 \u2264 0 (where the lower bound is due to the experimental bound on gluino\nmasses), imposing M3 < M1 , M2 . We fix M1/2 = 225 GeV and A = M1 . As in the\nprevious figures we are taking 30 GeV \u2264 m0 \u2264 550 GeV. We also superimpose for\ncomparison the region (green area) obtained in Fig. 4 for tan \u03b2 = 10 with universality,\n\u03b4i\u2032 = 0. Clearly non-universal gaugino masses produce a large increment in the cross\nsection.\nLet us finally remark that the upper and right hand side regions with large cross\nsections in the figure correspond to points of the parameter space fulfilling M2 < M1\n(and M3 close to its lower bound). As discussed in Section 2, for low or moderate\ntan \u03b2 the lightest neutralino is mainly gaugino P > 0.9, and in particular bino since\nN11 \u226b N12 . However, relaxing the universality condition for gaugino masses, M2 < M1\nwill produce N11 < N12 , and therefore the lightest neutralino will have an important\nwino componentf . Since the latter couples through SU(2) interactions, unlike the bino\ncomponent which couples through U(1) ones, the cross section increases.\n(iii) Non-universal gaugino and scalar masses\nf\n\nIt is worth noticing that this situation also arises in anomaly-mediated SUSY-breaking scenarios,\nwhere the cross section can also be increased [28, 29].\n\n11\n\n\fGiven the above situation concerning the enhancement of neutralino-proton cross\nsections through non-universality for moderate tan \u03b2, it is worth analyzing in principle the combination of both possibilities, non-universal gaugino and scalar masses.\nHowever the consequence for the cross section of combining the parameters studied in\n(i) and (ii) is not very different from the one obtained in Fig. 6. We have explicitly\nchecked that the qualitative pattern is basically the same.\n\n3.4\n\nScenario with intermediate unification scale\n\nIn the above subsections the analyses were performed assuming the unification scale\nMGU T \u2248 1016 GeV, as is usually done in the SUSY literature. However, it was recently\nrealized that the string scale may be anywhere between the weak and the Plank scale\n[30]-[36]. To use the value of the initial scale, say MI , as a free parameter for the\nrunning of the soft terms is particularly interesting since there are several arguments\nin favour of SUSY scenarios with scales MI \u2248 1010\u221214 GeV.\nFirst, these scales were suggested [33, 34] to explain many experimental observations\nas neutrino masses or the scale for axion physics. Second, with the string scale of the\norder of 1010\u221212 GeV one is able to attack the hierarchy problem of unified theories\nwithout invoking any hierarchically suppressed non-perturbative effect [33, 34]. Third,\nfor intermediate scale scenarios charge and color breaking constraints, which are very\nstrong with the usual scale MGU T [37], become less important [38]. There are other\narguments in favour of scenarios with initial scales MI smaller than MGU T . For example\nthese scales might also explain the observed ultra-high energy (\u2248 1020 eV) cosmic rays\nas products of long-lived massive string mode decays [33, 34] (see ref.[39] for more\ndetails about this possibility). Besides, several models of chaotic inflation favour also\nthese scales [40].\nInspired by these scenarios, it was pointed out [12]-[14] that the neutralino-proton\ncross section \u03c3\u03c7\u030301 \u2212p is very sensitive to the variation of the initial scale for the running\nof the soft terms. In particular, intermediate unification scales were considered. For\ninstance, by taking MI = 1010\u221212 GeV rather than MGU T , regions in the parameter\nspace of mSUGRA have been found where \u03c3\u03c7\u030301 \u2212p is in the expected range of sensitivity\nof present detectors, and this even for moderate values of tan \u03b2 (tan \u03b2 >\n\u223c 3). This\nanalysis was performed [12] in the universal scenario for the soft terms. In contrast, in\nthe usual case with initial scale at MGU T , this large cross section is achieved only for\ntan \u03b2 >\n\u223c 20, as discussed in Subsection 3.1.\nBefore trying to understand this result, let us discuss what we mean by an intermediate unification scale. Concerning this point two possible scenarios are schematically\nshown in Fig. 7 for the example MI = 1011 GeV. In scenario (a) the gauge couplings\nare non universal, \u03b1i 6= \u03b1, and their values depend on the initial scale MI chosen. An\ninteresting proposal in order to obtain this scenario in the context of type I string models is the following. If the standard model comes from the same collection of D-branes,\nstringy corrections might change the boundary conditions at the string scale MI to\nmimic the effect of field theoretical logarithmic running [41, 42]. Another possibility\n12\n\n\f\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n\n0.05\n\n0\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n0\n\n16\n\nlog10Q/GeV\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\nlog10Q/GeV\n\nFigure 7: Running of the gauge couplings with energy, shown with solid lines, assuming\n(a) non universality and (b) universality of couplings at the initial scale MI . For\ncomparison the usual running of the MSSM couplings is also shown with dashed lines.\ngiving rise to a similar result may arise when the gauge groups came from different\ntypes of D-branes. Since different D-branes have associated different couplings, this\nimplies the non universality of the gauge couplings. We will discuss this possibility in\nsome detail below.\nOn the other hand, scenario (b) with gauge coupling unification at MI , \u03b1i = \u03b1,\ncan be obtained with the addition of extra fields in the massless spectrum. For the\nexample of the figure these are doublets and singlets under the standard model gauge\ngroup.\nAs we will see below, the values of the gauge coupling constants at the intermediate\nscale will be important in the computation of the cross section, and scenario (a) will\nbe more interesting than (b).\nLet us now come back to the issue of the variation of the cross section with the\ninitial scale. The fact that smaller initial scales imply a larger neutralino-proton cross\nsection can be understood from the variation in the value of \u03bc with MI . One observes\nthat, for tan \u03b2 fixed, the smaller the initial scale for the running is, the smaller the\nnumerator in the first piece of eq.(7) becomes. This can be understood qualitatively\nfrom Fig. 2. Clearly, the smaller the initial scale is, the shorter the running becomes. As\na consequence, also the less important the positive(negative) contribution m2Hd (m2Hu )\nto \u03bc in eq.(7) becomes. Thus |\u03bc| decreases.\nAs discussed at the beginning of this Section 3, now the Higgsino components of the\nlightest neutralino, N13 and N14 in eq.(2), increase and therefore the spin independent\ncross section also increases [12]. This is shown in Figs. 8 and 9. In fact these figures\ncorrespond to the scenario in Fig. 7a with non-universal gauge couplings. For the\nscenario in Fig. 7b, only with tan \u03b2 >\n\u223c 20 one obtains regions consistent with DAMA\nlimits. One of the reasons being that now \u03b12 (MI ) and \u03b11 (MI ) are bigger than in\nscenario (a) and therefore the low-energy bino and wino masses appearing in eq.(1) are\nsmaller. As a consequence the increment of the cross section is less important.\nIt is also worth noticing that, for any fixed value of MI , the larger tan \u03b2 is, the\nlarger the Higgsino contributions become. The discussion concerning this point in\nSubsection 3.1 for MGU T is also valid for any initial scale MI .\n13\n\n\fFigure 8: Gaugino-Higgsino components-squared of the lightest neutralino as a function\nof its mass for the unification scale, MI = 1016 GeV, and for the intermediate scale,\nMI = 1011 GeV.\nIn Fig. 8, for tan \u03b2 = 10 and m0 = 150 GeV, we exhibit the gaugino-Higgsino\ncomponents-squared N1i2 of the lightest neutralino as a function of its mass m\u03c7\u030301 for\ntwo different values of the initial scale, MI = 1016 GeV \u2248 MGU T and MI = 1011\nGeV. Clearly, the smaller the scale is, the larger the Higgsino components become.\nFor MI = 1011 GeV, e.g. the Higgsino contribution N13 becomes important and even\ndominant for m\u03c7\u030301 <\n\u223c 140 GeV.\nThe consequence of the above results on the cross section is shown in Fig. 9, where\nthe cross section as a function of the lightest neutralino mass m\u03c7\u030301 is plotted. In\nparticular we are comparing the result for the scale MI = MGU T studied in Figs. 3\nand 4 with the result for the intermediate scale MI = 1011 GeV. For instance, when\nm\u03c7\u030301 = 100 GeV, \u03c3\u03c7\u030301 \u2212p for MI = 1011 GeV is two orders of magnitude larger than for\n\u22127\nMGU T . In particular, for tan \u03b2 = 3, one finds \u03c3\u03c7\u030301 \u2212p <\n\u223c 10 pb if the initial scale is\n\u22126\nMI = 1016 GeV. However \u03c3\u03c7\u030301 \u2212p <\n\u223c 10 GeV is possible if MI decreases.\nAs mentioned before, the larger tan \u03b2 is, the larger the Higgsino contributions\nbecome, and therefore the cross section increases. For tan \u03b2 = 10 we see in Fig. 9 that\nthe range 70 GeV <\n\u223c 100 GeV is now consistent with DAMA limits.\n\u223c m\u03c7\u030301 <\nLet us remark that these figures have been obtained [12] taking 30 <\n\u223c m0 <\n\u223c 550 GeV\nand A0 = M1/2 as in previous sections. In any case, as mentioned also in Section 2,\nthe cross section is not very sensitive to the specific values of A0 . In particular it was\nchecked that this is so for | A0 /M1/2 | <\n\u223c 1. For example, relation A0 = \u2212M1/2 is\nparticularly interesting since it arises naturally in several string models [22, 41].\nLet us finally recall that the above computations have been carried out for the case\nof universal soft terms. This is not only the most simple possibility in the framework of\nSUGRA, but is also allowed in the context of superstring models. This is e.g. the case\nof the dilaton-dominated SUSY-breaking scenario [22] or weakly and strongly coupled\n14\n\n\fFigure 9: The same as in Fig. 3b but for two values of the initial scale, MI = 1016 GeV\nand 1011 GeV, and for tan \u03b2 = 3 and 10.\nheterotic models with one K\u00e4hler modulus [43]. In this sense the analysis of neutralinonucleon cross sections of those models is included in the above analyses. This is exactly\ntrue for MI = MGU T . For intermediate unification scale, note that we are assuming\ngaugino mass universality at the high energy scale, although in this scenario gauge\ncouplings do not unify. This situation is in principle possible in generic supersymmetric\nmodels, however it is not so natural in supersymmetric models from supergravity where\ngaugino masses and gauge couplings are related through the gauge kinetic function.\nSince an explicit string construction with nonuniversal gauge couplings and gaugino\nmasses will be analyzed in detail below, we have chosen to simplify the discussion here\nassuming gaugino mass universality.\nObviously, following the discussion of Subsection 3.3, non universality of the soft\nterms in addition to intermediate scales may introduce more flexibility in the computation. In particular, decreasing |\u03bc| in order to obtain regions in the parameter space\ngiving rise to cross sections compatible with the sensitivity of current detectors, may\nbe easier.\nD-brane scenarios\nD-brane constructions are explicit scenarios where both situations mentioned above,\nnon-universality and intermediate scales, may occur. The first attempts to study dark\nmatter within these constructions were carried out in scenarios with the unification\nscale MGU T \u2248 1016 GeV as the initial scale [44, 10, 45] and dilaton-dominated SUSYbreaking scenarios with an intermediate scale as the initial scale [13]. However, the\nimportant issue of the D-brane origin of the U(1)Y gauge group as a combination of\nother U(1)'s and its influence on the matter distribution in these scenarios was not\nincluded in the above analyses. When this is taken into account, interesting results\n15\n\n\fare obtained [14]. In particular, scenarios with the gauge group and particle content of\nthe SUSY standard model lead naturally to intermediate values for the string scale, in\norder to reproduce the value of gauge couplings deduced from experiments. In addition,\nthe soft terms turn out to be generically non universal. Due to these results, large cross\nsections in the small tan \u03b2 regime can be obtained.\nLet us consider for example a type I string scenario [14] where the gauge group\nU(3) \u00d7 U(2) \u00d7 U(1), giving rise to SU(3) \u00d7 SU(2) \u00d7 U(1)3 , arises from three different\ntypes of D-branes, and therefore the gauge couplings are non-universal as in Fig. 7ag .\nOther examples with the standard model gauge group embedded in D-branes in a\ndifferent way can be found in ref.[14]. Here U(1)Y is a linear combination of the\nthree U(1) gauge groups arising from U(3), U(2) and U(1) within the three different\nD-branes. This implies\n1\n2\n1\n2\n=\n+\n+\n,\n\u03b1Y (MI )\n\u03b11 (MI ) \u03b12 (MI ) 3\u03b13 (MI )\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u03b1k correspond to the gauge couplings of the U(k) branes. As shown in ref.[14],\n\u03b11 (MI ) = 0.1 leads to the string scale MI = 1012 GeV. On the other hand, the extra\nU(1)'s are anomalous and therefore the associated gauge bosons have masses of the\norder of MI .\nThe analysis of the soft terms has been done under the assumption that only the\ndilaton (S) and moduli (Ti ) fields contribute to SUSY breaking and it has been found\nthat these soft terms are generically non-universal. Using the standard parameterization [22]\n\u221a\nF S = 3(S + S \u2217 )m3/2 sin \u03b8 ,\n\u221a\nF i = 3(Ti + Ti\u2217 )m3/2 cos \u03b8 \u0398i ,\n(14)\nwhere i = 1, 2, 3 labels the three complex compact dimensions, and the angle \u03b8 and\nP\nthe \u0398i with i |\u0398i |2 = 1, just parameterize the direction of the goldstino in the S,\nTi field space, one is able to obtain the following soft terms [14].

In the analysis the parameters \u03b8 and \u0398i are varied in the whole\nallowed range, 0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 2\u03c0, \u22121 \u2264 \u0398i \u2264 1. For the gravitino mass, m3/2 \u2264 300 GeV\nis taken. Concerning Yukawa couplings, their values are fixed imposing the correct\nfermion mass spectrum at low energies, i.e., one is assuming that Yukawa structures of\nD-brane scenarios give rise to those values.\nFig. 10 displays a scatter plot of \u03c3\u03c7\u030301 \u2212p as a function of the neutralino mass m\u03c7\u030301 for\na scanning of the parameter space discussed above. Two different values of tan \u03b2, 10\nand 15, are shown. LEP and Tevatron bounds on SUSY masses are included as in the\nprevious sections. They forbid e.g. values of m3/2 smaller than 170 GeV. Although\nbounds coming from CLEO b \u2192 s\u03b3 branching ratio measurements are not included in\nthe figures, one can check explicitly that their qualitative patterns are not modified.\nIt is worth noticing that for tan \u03b2 = 10 there are regions of the parameter space\nconsistent with DAMA limits. In fact, one can check that tan \u03b2 > 5 is enough to\nobtain compatibility with DAMA. Since the larger tan \u03b2 is, the larger the cross section\nbecomes, for tan \u03b2 = 15 these regions increase.\nLet us recall that both plots in the figure are obtained taking m3/2 \u2264 300 GeV,\nwhich corresponds to squark masses smaller than 500 GeV at low energies. Larger\nvalues of m3/2 will always produce cross sections below DAMA limits. In particular,\nthe right hand side and bottom of the plots will also be filled with points. Cross sections\nbelow projected GENIUS limits will be possible for both figures. On the other hand,\nit is worth mentioning that the isolated points in the plots with, in general, very large\nvalues of the cross section correspond to values of the lightest stop mass extremely\nclose to the mass of the LSP, in particular (mt\u0303 \u2212 m\u03c7\u030301 )/mt\u0303 < 0.01.\n17\n\n\fFigure 10: The same as in Fig. 3b but for the D-brane scenario with the string scale\nMI = 1012 GeV discussed in the text, and for tan \u03b2 = 10 and 15.\nFinally, let us mention that scenarios where all gauge groups of the standard model\nare embedded within the same set of D-branes, and therefore with gauge coupling\nunification, are also possible. However, unlike the previous scenario, now tan \u03b2 > 20 is\nnecessary in order to obtain regions consistent with DAMA limits [14]. As discussed\nabove in the context of mSUGRA this is due to the different values of the \u03b1's at the\nstring scale in both types of scenarios.\n\n4\n\nRelic neutralino density versus cross section\n\nAs discussed in the Introduction, current dark matter detectors are sensitive to a\nneutralino-proton cross section around 10\u22126 pb. This value is obtained taking into\naccount, basically, that the density of dark matter in our Galaxy, which follows from\nthe observed rotation curves, is \u03c1DM \u2248 0.3 GeV/cm3 . Thus in this work we were\nmainly interested in reviewing the possibility of obtaining such large cross sections in\nthe context of SUSY scenarios. In order to compute the cross section only simple field\ntheory techniques are needed, no cosmological assumptions about the early Universe\nneed to be used.\nOn the other hand, such cosmological assumptions indeed must be taken into account when computing the amount of relic neutralino density arising from the above\nscenarios. Generically, one obtains [6]\n\u03a9\u03c7\u030301 h2 \u2243\n\nC\n<\n\n\u03c3\u03c7\u0303ann\n0 .v\n1\n\n>\n\n,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere \u03c3\u03c7\u0303ann\nis the cross section for annihilation of a pair of neutralinos into standard\n0\n1\nmodel particles, v is the relative velocity between the two neutralinos, and < .. >\ndenotes thermal averaging. The constant C involves factors of Newton's constant, the\n18\n\n\ftemperature of the cosmic background radiation, etc. Then one may compare this\nresult with dark matter observations in the Universe. Let us then discuss briefly the\neffect of relic neutralino density bounds on cross sections.\nThe most robust evidence for the existence of dark matter comes from relatively\nsmall scales. Lower limits inferred from the flat rotation curves of spiral Galaxies [6, 46]\nare \u03a9DM h2 >\n\u223c 0.01 \u2212 0.05, where h is the reduced Hubble constant. On the opposite\nside, observations at large scales, (6 \u2212 20) h\u22121 Mpc, have provided estimates [47] of\n\u03a9DM h2 \u2248 0.1\u22120.6, but values as low as \u03a9DM h2 \u2248 0.02 have also been quoted [48]. Taking up-to-date limits on h, the baryon density from nucleosynthesis and overall matter2\nbalance analysis one is able to obtain a favoured range [2, 49, 50], 0.01 <\n\u223c \u03a9DM h <\n\u223c 0.3\n(at \u223c 2\u03c3 CL). Note that conservative lower limits in the small and large scales are of\nthe same order of magnitude.\nAs is well known, for \u03c3\u03c7\u0303ann\nof the order of a weak-process cross section, \u03a9\u03c7\u030301 obtained\n0\n1\nfrom eq.(18) is within the favoured range discussed above [6]. This is precisely the\ngeneric case when the lightest neutralino is mainly bino. Then, the neutralino-nucleus\ncross section is of the order of 1 pb, i.e. \u03c3\u03c7\u030301 \u2212p \u2248 10\u22128 pb, and therefore it is natural\nto obtain that neutralinos annihilate with very roughly the weak interaction strength.\nThese cross sections were discussed in Section 2 where low and moderate values of tan \u03b2\nwithin mSUGRA were considered. In fact, for these cross sections, there is always a\nset of parameters which yield 0.1 < \u03a9\u03c7\u030301 h2 < 0.3. This analysis, including a complete\ntreatment of coannihilations was carried out in refs.[16, 51].\nOn the other hand, in this review we were interested in larger neutralino-nucleon\ncross sections in order to be in the range of sensitivity of current dark matter detectors.\nIt is then expected that such high neutralino-proton cross sections \u03c3\u03c7\u030301 \u2212p \u2248 10\u22126 pb, as\nthose presented in Section 3, will correspond to relatively low relic neutralino densities.\nThis is in general the situation. There is always a set of parameters for which the value\nof the relic density is still inside the ranges we considered above when discussing the\nobservational bounds, but it is generically close to the conservative lower bound. The\nanalysis of the relic neutralino density for scenarios with large tan \u03b2 and non-universal\nscalar masses was carried out in refs.[7, 8, 9, 52]. Scenarios with non-universal gaugino\nmasses were studied in refs.[26, 27]. An analysis of the relic density for focus point\nsupersymmetry can be found in ref.[11]. Discussions for scenarios with intermediate\nunification scales can be found in refs.[12]-[14]h .\nFinally, in case of preferring the stronger lower bound \u03a9DM h2 > 0.1, let us mention\nthe possibility that not all the dark matter in our Galaxy are neutralinos. Then \u03a9\u03c7\u030301 <\n\u03a9DM , and therefore \u03a9\u03c7\u030301 < 0.1 is possible. However, due to the corresponding reduction\nin the density of neutralinos in the Galactic halo, the neutralino-proton cross section\nshould be increased in order to maintain the experimental detection rates [16, 55, 56].\nh\n\nLet us remark, however, that scenarios with intermediate scales might give rise to cosmological\nresults different from the usual ones summarized in eq.(18) [53].\n\n19\n\n\f5\n\nFinal comments and outlook\n\nThere is overwhelming evidence that most of the matter in the Universe is dark matter.\nIn the present paper we have reviewed the direct detection of supersymmetric dark\nmatter in the light of recent experimental efforts. In particular, DAMA collaboration\nusing a NaI detector has reported recently [4] data favouring the existence of a WIMP\nsignal in their search for annual modulation. They require a large cross section of the\norder of 10\u22126 pb. We have observed that there are regions in the parameter space of\nSUGRA scenarios [7]-[14] where such a value can be obtained, although it is fair to say\nthat smaller values can also be obtained and even more easily. The latter result may\nbe important since CDMS collaboration using a germanium detector has reported a\nnull result for part of the region explored by DAMA. Clearly, more sensitive detectors\nproducing further data are needed to solve this contradiction. Fortunately, many dark\nmatter detectors are being projected. This is the case e.g. of DAMA 250 kg. and\nCDMS Soudan, but particularly interesting is the projected GENIUS [20] detector\nwhere values of the cross section as low as 10\u22129 pb will be accesible.\nIn summary, underground physics as the one discussed here in order to detect dark\nmatter is crucial. Even if neutralinos are discovered at future particle accelerators\nsuch as LHC, only their direct detection due to their presence in our galactic halo will\nconfirm that they are the sought-after dark matter of the Universe.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank E.
