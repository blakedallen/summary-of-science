We introduce the notion of an M-family of infinite subsets of N\nwhich is implicitly contained in the work of A. R. D. Mathias. We study\nthe structure of a pair of orthogonal hereditary families A and B, where A is\nanalytic and B is C-measurable and an M-family.\n\n1. Introduction\nTwo families A and B of infinite subsets of N are said to be orthogonal if A \u2229\nB is finite for every A \u2208 A and every B \u2208 B. The study of the structure of\na pair (A, B) of orthogonal families is a classical topic ([Hau]) which has found\nnumerous applications (see, for instance, [DW] and [To4]). Among all pairs (A, B)\nof orthogonal families of particular importance is the study of the definable ones.\nHere the word definable refers to the descriptive set theoretic complexity of A and\nB as subsets of P(N). A fundamental result in this direction is the \"perfect Lusin\ngap\" theorem of Stevo Todor\u010devi\u0107 [To2] which deals with a pair of analytic and\northogonal families.\nIn this paper we study the structure of a pair (A, B) of hereditary and orthogonal\nfamilies where A is analytic and B is C-measurable2 and \"large\". Our notion of\nlargeness is the following which is implicitly contained in the work of A. R. D.\nMathias [Ma].\nDefinition 1. We say that a hereditary family A of infinite subsets of N is an\nM-family if for every sequence (An )n in A there exists A \u2208 A whose all but finitely\nS\nmany elements are in i\u2265n Ai for every n \u2208 N.\nWe should point out that there are several other notions appearing in the literature, such as P-ideals (see [So], [To2]) or semi-selective co-ideals (see [Fa]), involving\nthe existence of diagonal sequences. We should also point out that the notion of an\nM-family is closely related to the weak diagonal sequence property of topological\nspaces and, in fact, it can be considered as its combinatorial analogue.\nUsing Ellentuck's theorem [El] we show that the class of C-measurable M-families\npossesses strong stability properties. It is closed, for instance, under intersection\nand \"diagonal\" products. As a consequence we prove that if (X, \u03c41 ) and (Y, \u03c42 ) are\n1\n\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification: 03E15, 05D10, 28A05, 54H05.\n\n2We recall that a subset of a Polish space is C-measurable if it belongs to the smallest \u03c3-algebra\n\nthat contains the open sets and is closed under the Souslin operation.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nPANDELIS DODOS AND VASSILIS KANELLOPOULOS\n\ntwo countable analytic spaces with the weak diagonal sequence property, then the\nproduct (X \u00d7 Y, \u03c41 \u00d7 \u03c42 ) has the weak diagonal sequence property. This answers\nQuestion 5.4 from [TU].\nOur first result, concerning the structure of a pair (A, B) as described above, is\nthe following (see \u00a72 for the relevant definitions).\nTheorem I. Let A and B be two hereditary, orthogonal families of infinite subsets\nof N. Assume that A is analytic and that B is an M-family and C-measurable.\nThen, either\n(i) A is countably generated in B \u22a5 , or\n(ii) there exists a perfect Lusin gap inside (A, B).\nTheorem I shows that the assumption of being an M-family can successfully replace\nanalyticity in the perfect Lusin gap theorem of [To2]. We should point out that the\nphenomenon of replacing analyticity by a structural property and still getting the\nsame conclusion as in Theorem I has already appeared in the literature (see [To4]\nand [TU]). As a matter of fact Theorem I was motivated by these applications.\nOur second result, concerning the structure of a pair (A, B) as in Theorem I,\nextends a result of A. Krawczyk from [Kr]. To state it, it is useful to look at the\nsecond orthogonal B \u22a5\u22a5 of B. In a sense the family B \u22a5\u22a5 is the \"completion\" of B,\nas an infinite subset L of N belongs to B \u22a5\u22a5 if (and only if) every infinite subset of\nL contains an element of B. To proceed with our discussion, let C be the family of\nall infinite chains of N<N (we recall that a subset of N<N is called a chain if it is\nlinearly ordered under the order of end-extension). Let also Iwf be the ideal on N<N\ngenerated by the set WF of all downwards closed, well-founded, infinite subtrees of\nN<N . The following theorem shows that if A, B are as above and A is not countably\ngenerated in B \u22a5 , then the pair (C, Iwf ) \"embeds\" into the pair (A, B \u22a5\u22a5 ) in a very\ncanonical way.\nTheorem II. Let A and B be two hereditary, orthogonal families of infinite subsets\nof N. Assume that A is analytic and that B is an M-family and C-measurable.\nThen, either\n(i) A is countably generated in B \u22a5 , or\n(ii) there exists a one-to-one map \u03c8 : N<N \u2192 N such that\nC \u2286 {\u03c8 \u22121 (A) : A \u2208 A} and Iwf \u2286 {\u03c8 \u22121 (B) : B \u2208 B \u22a5\u22a5 }.\nOne of the main ingredients of the proofs of Theorem I and of Theorem II is the\ninfinite dimensional extension of Hindman's theorem [Hi], due to K. Milliken [Mil].\nIt is used in a spirit similar as in [ADK].\nThe paper is organized as follows. In \u00a72 we gather some preliminaries needed\nin the rest of the paper. In \u00a73 we study the connection of M-families with other\nrelated notions and we give some examples. In \u00a74 we present some of their structural\n\n\fON PAIRS OF DEFINABLE ORTHOGONAL FAMILIES\n\n3\n\nproperties. The proof of Theorem I is given in \u00a75 while the proof of Theorem II is\ngiven in \u00a76. Our general notation and terminology is standard, as can be found in\n[Ke] and [To3].\nAcknowledgments. We would like to thank the anonymous referee for his thorough report which improved the presentation of the paper.\n2. Preliminaries\nIt is a common fact that once one is willing to present some results about trees,\nideals and related combinatorics, then one has to set up a, rather large, notational\nsystem. Below we gather all the conventions that we need and which are, more or\nless, standard. In what follows X will be a countable (infinite) set.\n2.1. Ideals. By P\u221e (X) we denote the set of all infinite subsets of X (which is\nclearly a Polish subspace of 2X ). A family A \u2286 P\u221e (X) is hereditary if for every\nA \u2208 A and every A\u2032 \u2208 P\u221e (A) we have A\u2032 \u2208 A. A subfamily B of a family A is\ncofinal in A if for every A \u2208 A there exists B \u2208 P\u221e (A) with B \u2208 B.\nGiven A, B \u2208 P\u221e (X) we write A \u2286\u2217 B if the set A \\ B is finite, while we\nwrite A \u22a5 B if the set A \u2229 B is finite. Two families A, B \u2286 P\u221e (X) are said to\nbe orthogonal, in symbols A \u22a5 B, if A \u22a5 B for every A \u2208 A and every B \u2208 B.\nFor every A \u2286 P\u221e (X) we set A\u22a5 = {B \u2208 P\u221e (X) : B \u22a5 A for all A \u2208 A} and\nA\u2217 = {X \\ A : A \u2208 A}. The family A\u22a5 is called the orthogonal of A. Notice that\nA\u22a5 is an ideal.\nTwo families A and B are countably separated if there exists a sequence (Cn )n\nin P\u221e (X) such that for every A \u2208 A and every B \u2208 B there exists n \u2208 N with\nA \u2286 Cn and Cn \u22a5 B. A family A is countably generated in a family B, if there\nexists a sequence (Bn )n in B such that for every A \u2208 A there exists n \u2208 N with\nA \u2286\u2217 Bn . An ideal I on X is said to be bisequential if for every ultrafilter p on X\nwith I \u2286 p\u2217 the family I is countably generated in p\u2217 .\nGiven A \u2286 P\u221e (X) we let\n(1)\n\nco(A) = {B \u2208 P\u221e (X) : \u2203A \u2208 A with B \u2229 A infinite} = P\u221e (X) \\ A\u22a5 .\n\nNotice that co(A) is a co-ideal. We call co(A) as the co-ideal generated by A.\nObserve that if A is hereditary, then co(A) = {B \u2208 P\u221e (X) : \u2203A \u2208 A with A \u2286 B}.\nThe following elementary, well-known, fact provides the description of the second\northogonal A\u22a5\u22a5 of a hereditary family A.\nFact 1. Let A \u2286 P\u221e (X) hereditary. Let also B \u2208 P\u221e (X). Then B \u2208 A\u22a5\u22a5 if and\nonly if for every C \u2208 P\u221e (B) there exists A \u2208 P\u221e (C) with A \u2208 A.\nAn ideal I is said to have the Fr\u00e9chet property if I = I \u22a5\u22a5 . We notice that if\nA is a hereditary family, then both A\u22a5 and A\u22a5\u22a5 have the Fr\u00e9chet property. The\nfollowing fact is also well-known. We sketch its proof for completeness.\n\n\f4\n\nPANDELIS DODOS AND VASSILIS KANELLOPOULOS\n\nFact 2. A bisequential ideal I on X has the Fr\u00e9chet property.\nProof. In light of Fact 1, it is enough to show that for every A \u2208\n/ I there exists\nC \u2208 P\u221e (A) with C \u2208 I \u22a5 . So, let A \u2208\n/ I. The family {A \\ L : L \u2208 I} has the finite\nintersection property. Hence, we may find p \u2208 \u03b2X, non-principal, with I \u2286 p\u2217 and\nA \u2208 p. By the bisequentiality of I, there exists a sequence (Bn )n in p\u2217 such that\nfor every L \u2208 I there exists n \u2208 N with L \u2286\u2217 Bn . Clearly, we may assume that the\nsequence (Bn )n is increasing. Let C be an infinite diagonalization of the decreasing\nsequence (A \\ Bn )n . Then C \u2208 P\u221e (A) and C \u2208 I \u22a5 . The proof is completed.\n\u0003\n2.2. Trees and block sequences. By X <N we shall denote the set of all finite\nsequences in X. We view X <N as a tree under the (strict) partial order \u228f of endextension. For every s, t \u2208 X <N by sa t we denote their concatenation. If T is a\ndownwards closed subtree of X <N , then by [T ] we shall denote its body, i.e. the set\n{\u03c3 \u2208 X N : \u03c3|n \u2208 T \u2200n \u2208 N}. Two nodes s, t \u2208 T are said to be comparable if either\nt \u2291 s or s \u2291 t; otherwise they are said to be incomparable. A subset of T consisting\nof pairwise comparable nodes is said to be a chain, while a subset of T consisting\nof pairwise incomparable nodes is said to be an antichain.\nBy \u03a3 we shall denote the downwards closed subtree of N<N consisting of all\nstrictly increasing finite sequences. We view, however, every t \u2208 \u03a3 not only as a\nfinite increasing sequence but also as finite subset of N. Given s, t \u2208 \u03a3 \\ {\u2205} we\nwrite s < t if max s < min t. By convention \u2205 < t for every t \u2208 \u03a3 with t 6= \u2205. If\ns, t \u2208 \u03a3 with s < t, then we will frequently denote by s \u222a t the concatenation of s\nand t.\nBy B we shall denote the closed subset of \u03a3N (\u03a3 equipped with the discrete\ntopology) consisting of all sequences (bn )n with bn 6= \u2205 and bn < bn+1 for every\nn \u2208 N. We call a sequence b = (bn )n \u2208 B a block sequence. For every block\nsequence b = (bn )n we set\n\b [\n\b\n(2) hbi =\nbn : F \u2286 N finite \u2286 \u03a3 and [b] = (cn )n \u2208 B : cn \u2208 hbi \u2200n .\nn\u2208F\n\nWe will need the following consequence of K. Milliken's theorem [Mil].\nTheorem 2. Let X be a C-measurable subset of B. Then there exists b \u2208 B such\nthat either [b] \u2286 X or X \u2229 [b] = \u2205.\nWe recall that the class of C-measurable sets is strictly bigger than the \u03c3-algebra\ngenerated by the analytic sets (see, for instance, [Ke]).\n2.3. Lusin gaps and related results. Let A, B \u2286 P\u221e (X). A perfect Lusin gap\ninside (A, B) is a continuous, one-to-one map 2N \u220b x 7\u2192 (Ax , Bx ) \u2208 A \u00d7 B such that\nthe following are satisfied.\n(a) For every x \u2208 2N , Ax \u2229 Bx = \u2205.\n(b) For every x, y \u2208 2N with x 6= y, (Ax \u2229 By ) \u222a (Ay \u2229 Bx ) 6= \u2205.\n\n\fON PAIRS OF DEFINABLE ORTHOGONAL FAMILIES\n\n5\n\nThe notion of a perfect Lusin gap was introduced by S. Todor\u010devi\u0107. We notice that\nif there exists a perfect Lusin gap inside (A, B), then A and B are not countably\nseparated. The following result of Todor\u010devi\u0107 [To2] shows that this the only case\nfor a pair of analytic and orthogonal families.\nTheorem 3. Let A and B be two analytic, hereditary and orthogonal families of\ninfinite subsets of N. Then, either\n(i) A and B are countably separated, or\n(ii) there exists a perfect Lusin gap inside (A, B).\nTheorem 3 is a consequence of the Open Coloring Axiom for \u03a311 sets (see [Fe],\n[To1]). We should point out that it is the perfectness of the gap which is essential\nin many applications. We refer the reader to [To2] and [To4] for more information.\nWe will also need the following slight reformulation of [To2, Theorem 3].\nTheorem 4. Let A, B \u2286 P\u221e (N) be two hereditary orthogonal families. Assume that\nA is analytic and not countably generated in B \u22a5 . Then there exists a one-to-one\nmap \u03c6 : \u03a3 \u2192 N such that, setting\nE = {\u03c6\u22121 (A) : A \u2208 A} and H = {\u03c6\u22121 (B) : B \u2208 B},\nthe following are satisfied.\n(i) For every \u03c3 \u2208 [\u03a3] the set {\u03c3|n : n \u2208 N} belongs to E.\n\b\n(ii) For every t \u2208 \u03a3 the set t \u222a {n} : n \u2208 N and t < {n}\nsuccessors of t in \u03a3 belongs to H.\n\nof immediate\n\nProof. Assume that A is analytic, hereditary and not countably generated in B \u22a5 .\nBy [To2, Theorem 3], there exists a downwards closed subtree T of \u03a3 such that the\nfollowing are satisfied.\n(B1) For every \u03c3 \u2208 [T ], {\u03c3(n) : n \u2208 N} \u2208 A.\n(B2) For every t \u2208 T , the set {n \u2208 N : t < {n} and t \u222a {n} \u2208 T } is infinite and\nis included in an element of B.\nRecursively and using property (B2) above, we may select a downwards closed\nsubtree S of T such that the following hold.\n(a) For all s \u2208 S, the set {n \u2208 N : s < {n} and s \u222a {n} \u2208 S} is infinite.\n(b) For all s, w \u2208 S \\ {\u2205} with s 6= w, we have max s 6= max w.\nFix m \u2208 N such that (m) \u2208 S and let Sm = {t \u2208 \u03a3 : (m)a t \u2208 S}. By (a) above,\nSm is an infinitely splitting, downwards closed subtree of \u03a3. Hence, there exists\na bijection h : \u03a3 \u2192 Sm such that |t| = |h(t)| for all t \u2208 \u03a3 and moreover s \u228f t if\nand only if h(s) \u228f h(t) for all s, t \u2208 \u03a3. Now define \u03c6 : \u03a3 \u2192 N as follows. We set\n\u03c6(\u2205) = m. For every t \u2208 \u03a3 with t 6= \u2205 we set \u03c6(t) = max h(t). Notice that, by (b)\nabove, the map \u03c6 is one-to-one. It is easy to check that \u03c6 is as desired.\n\u0003\n\n\f6\n\nPANDELIS DODOS AND VASSILIS KANELLOPOULOS\n\n3. Connections with related notions and examples\nIn this section we present the relation between M-families and other notions\nalready studied in the literature. Let us start with the following fact which provides\ncharacterizations of M-families. The proof is left to the interested reader.\nFact 3. Let X be a countable set and A \u2286 P\u221e (X) be a hereditary family. Then\nthe following are equivalent.\n(i) The family A is an M-family.\n(ii) For every decreasing sequence (Dn )n in co(A) there exists A \u2208 A with\nA \u2286\u2217 Dn for every n \u2208 N.\n(iii) For every sequence (An )n in A there exists A \u2208 A such that A \u2229 An 6= \u2205\nfor infinitely many n \u2208 N.\nThe notion of an M-family is closely related to the notion of a selective co-ideal\ndue to A. R. D. Mathias. We recall that a co-ideal F on N is said to be selective,\nor a happy family as it is called in [Ma], if for every decreasing sequence (Dn )n in\nF there exists D \u2208 F such that D \\ {0, ..., n} \u2286 Dn for all n \u2208 D. We have the\nfollowing characterization of M-families which justifies our terminology.\nProposition 5. Let A be a hereditary family on N. Then A is an M-family if and\nonly if the co-ideal co(A) generated by A is selective.\nProof. First assume that the co-ideal co(A) is selective. Let (Dn )n be a decreasing\nsequence in co(A). By the selectivity of co(A), there exists D \u2208 co(A) with D \\\n{0, ..., n} \u2286 Dn for all n \u2208 D. Pick A \u2208 A with A \u2286 D. Then A \u2286\u2217 Dn for all\nn \u2208 N. By Fact 3(ii), we see that A is an M-family.\nConversely, assume that A is an M-family. Let (Dn )n be a decreasing sequence in\nco(A). By Fact 3(ii), there exists A \u2208 A with A \u2286\u2217 Dn for all n \u2208 N. Recursively,\nwe select a strictly increasing sequence (mn )n in N such that m0 = min A and\nmn+1 \u2208 A \u2229 Dmn for every n \u2208 N. We set D = {mn : n \u2208 N}. Then D \u2286 A and\nD \\ {0, ..., n} \u2286 Dn for all n \u2208 D. As A is hereditary we get that D \u2208 A \u2286 co(A).\nHence, co(A) is selective and the proof is completed.\n\u0003\nThe following proposition shows that the notion of an M-family is, in a sense,\nthe \"dual\" notion of bisequentiality.\nProposition 6. Let X be a countable set.\n(i) Let A \u2286 P\u221e (X) be a hereditary family. If A\u22a5 is bisequential, then A is an\nM-family.\n(ii) Let I be an ideal on X. If I is bisequential, then I \u22a5 is an M-family.\nProof. (i) By Fact 3(ii), it is enough to show that for every decreasing sequence\n(Dn )n in co(A) there exists A \u2208 A with A \u2286\u2217 Dn for every n \u2208 N. So, let (Dn )n\nbe one. As A\u22a5 is an ideal, the family {Dn \\ L : n \u2208 N and L \u2208 A\u22a5 } has the finite\n\n\fON PAIRS OF DEFINABLE ORTHOGONAL FAMILIES\n\n7\n\nintersection property. Hence, we may select p \u2208 \u03b2X with A\u22a5 \u2286 p\u2217 and Dn \u2208 p\nfor all n \u2208 N. Notice that p is non-principal. By the bisequentiality of A\u22a5 , there\nexists a sequence (Cn )n in p\u2217 such that for every B \u2208 A\u22a5 there exists n \u2208 N with\nB \u2286\u2217 Cn . We may assume that the sequence (Cn )n is increasing. Let Q \u2208 P\u221e (X)\nbe a diagonalization of the decreasing sequence (Dn \\ Cn )n . Then Q \u2286\u2217 Dn and\nQ \u22a5 Cn for all n \u2208 N. By the properties of the sequence (Cn )n we see that Q \u2208\n/ A\u22a5 .\n\u2217\nAs A is hereditary, there exists A \u2286 Q with A \u2208 A. Hence A \u2286 Dn for all n \u2208 N.\nThus A is an M-family.\n(ii) By Fact 2, the ideal I has the Fr\u00e9chet property. Thus I \u22a5\u22a5 is bisequential and\nso the result follows by part (i).\n\u0003\nWe notice that the converse of Proposition 6(i) is also true, provided that the\northogonal A\u22a5 of A is analytic. Indeed, let A be an M-family such that A\u22a5 is\n\u03a311 . By Proposition 5, we see that the co-ideal co(A) generated by A is selective.\nIf follows that A\u22a5 is an analytic ideal whose complement, co(A), is selective. By\n[To3, Exercise 12.3], we get that A\u22a5 is bisequential.\nWe proceed our discussion by presenting some examples of M-families.\nExample 1. Let Ic be the ideal on N<N generated by the infinite chains of N<N .\nThat is\n(3)\n\nk\n[\n\b\nIc = C \u2208 P\u221e (N<N ) : \u2203\u03c30 , ..., \u03c3k \u2208 NN with C \u2286\n{\u03c3i |n : n \u2208 N} .\ni=0\n\nNotice that Ic has the Fr\u00e9chet property. We set A = Ic\u22a5 . Namely A consists of all\ninfinite subsets of N<N not containing an infinite chain. Then A is an ideal and it\nis easy to see that it is \u03a011 -complete. The family A is an M-family. We will give a\nsimple argument showing this. We will use Fact 3(ii). So, let (Dn )n be a decreasing\nsequence in co(A). For every n \u2208 N there exists an infinite antichain An of N<N\nwith An \u2286 Dn . Let An = (tnm )m be an enumeration of An . By an application of\nRamsey's theorem, we may assume that |tnm | \u2264 |tkl | for all n < m < k < l. We set\n\b\nI = (n < m < k < l) \u2208 [N]4 : tnm is incomparable with tkl .\nBy Ramsey's theorem again, there exists L \u2208 P\u221e (N) such that either [L]4 \u2286 I or\n[L]4 \u2229 I = \u2205. Let L = {l0 < l1 < ...} be the increasing enumeration of L. We claim\nthat [L]4 \u2286 I. If not, then tll01 is comparable with tll34 and as |tll01 | \u2264 |tll34 |, we get that\ntll01 \u2291 tll34 . Similarly we get that tll02 \u2291 tll34 . But this implies that the nodes tll01 and\ntll02 are comparable, contradicting the fact that Al0 is an antichain. Thus [L]4 \u2286 I.\nNow set A = {tll2n\n: n \u2208 N}. Then A is an infinite antichain, and so, A \u2208 A. As\n2n+1\n\u2217\nA \u2286 Dn for all n \u2208 N, this shows that A is an M-family.\nExample 2. We notice that if an ideal I has the Fr\u00e9chet property, then I \u22a5 is not\nnecessarily an M-family. For instance, let Id be the ideal of all dominated subsets\n\n\f8\n\nPANDELIS DODOS AND VASSILIS KANELLOPOULOS\n\nof N<N , that is\n\b\n(4) Id = D \u2208 P\u221e (N<N ) : \u2203\u03c3 \u2208 NN such that \u2200t \u2208 D \u2200i < |t| t(i) < \u03c3(i) .\nLet also\n(5)\n\n\b\nIwf = W \u2208 P\u221e (N<N ) : \u2203T \u2208 WF with W \u2286 T\n\nbe the ideal on N<N generated by the set WF of all downwards closed, well-founded,\ninfinite subtrees of N<N . Clearly Ic \u2286 Id . It is easy to see that Id\u22a5 = Iwf and\n\u22a5\nIwf\n= Id . Hence, the ideal Id has the Fr\u00e9chet property. As in the above example,\nwe set A = Id\u22a5 = Iwf . Again we see that A is a \u03a011 -complete ideal. However, A is\nnot an M-family. To see this, for every n \u2208 N let Dn = {t \u2208 N<N : 0n+1 \u2291 t}. Then\n(Dn )n is a decreasing sequence of sets in co(A). It is easy to check that if A is any\ninfinite subset of N<N with A \u2286\u2217 Dn for all n \u2208 N, then A must belong to Id .\nExample 3. Let E be a Polish space and f = {fn }n be a pointwise bounded\nsequence of real-valued Baire-1 functions on E. Assume that the closure K of\n{fn }n in RE is a subset of the set of all Baire-1 functions on E, i.e. K is a separable\nRosenthal compact (see [Ro]). Let f \u2208 K and set\n\b\n(6)\nLf = L \u2208 P\u221e (N) : (fn )n\u2208L converges pointwise to f .\nThe family Lf is a \u03a011 ideal. We also let\n\b\np\n(7)\nIf = L \u2208 P\u221e (N) : f \u2208\n/ {fn }n\u2208L .\nIt is easy to see that If is a \u03a311 ideal. Both Lf and If are well studied in the\nliterature (see [ADK], [Do], [Kr], [To3], [To4]). By a result of J. Bourgain, D. H.\nFremlin and M. Talagrand [BFT], we get that the orthogonal L\u22a5\nf of Lf is the family\nIf . An important fact concerning the structure of If is that it is bisequential. This\nis due to R. Pol [Po] and it can be also derived by the results of G. Debs in [De].\nHence, by Proposition 6(i), we see that Lf is an M-family. Let also\n\b\np\n(8)\nFf = L \u2208 P\u221e (N) : f \u2208 {fn }n\u2208L = P\u221e (N) \\ If .\nThe equality L\u22a5\nf = If yields that the co-ideal co(Lf ) generated by Lf is the family\nFf . By Proposition 5, it follows that Ff is a selective co-ideal, a fact discovered by\nS. Todor\u010devi\u0107 in [To3].\n4. Properties of M-families\nThis section is devoted to the study of the structural properties of M-families.\nWe begin by noticing the following fact (the proof is left to the reader).\nFact 4. Let X be a countable set.\n(i) If A \u2286 P\u221e (X) is a hereditary family and B is a hereditary subfamily of A\ncofinal in A, then A is an M-family if and only if B is.\n(ii) If A, B \u2286 P\u221e (X) are two M-families, then so is A \u222a B.\n\n\fON PAIRS OF DEFINABLE ORTHOGONAL FAMILIES\n\n9\n\nMost of the properties of M-families we will establish, are derived using an\ninfinite-dimensional Ramsey-type argument. To state it, we need to introduce some\npieces of notation. Let C = (Cn )n be a sequence in P\u221e (N) such that Cn \u2229 Cm = \u2205\nfor every n 6= m. For every n \u2208 N let {xn0 < xn1 < ...} be the increasing enumeration\nof the set Cn . We define \u2206C : P\u221e (N) \u2192 P\u221e (N) as follows. If L \u2208 P\u221e (N) with\nL = {l0 < l1 < ...} its increasing enumeration, we set\n\b\n(9)\n\u2206C (L) = xll2n\n:n\u2208N .\n2n+1\nNotice that the map \u2206C is continuous.\nLemma 7. Let A \u2286 P\u221e (N) be an M-family and C = (Cn )n be a sequence in\nA such that Cn \u2229 Cm = \u2205 for every n 6= m. Assume that A is C-measurable.\nThen for every N \u2208 P\u221e (N) there exists L \u2208 P\u221e (N ) such that \u2206C (M ) \u2208 A for all\nM \u2208 P\u221e (L).\nProof. Let\nCA = {M \u2208 P\u221e (N) : \u2206C (M ) \u2208 A}.\nThen CA is C-measurable. By Ellentuck's theorem [El], we find L \u2208 P\u221e (N ) such\nthat either P\u221e (L) \u2286 CA or P\u221e (L) \u2229 CA = \u2205. It is enough to show that P\u221e (L) \u2229\nCA 6= \u2205. To this end we argue as follows. For every n \u2208 L we set\nHn = {xni : i \u2208 L and i > n}.\nThen Hn \u2286 Cn and so Hn \u2208 A for all n \u2208 L. By Fact 3(iii), there exists A \u2208 A\nsuch that A \u2229 Hn 6= \u2205 for infinitely many n \u2208 L. We can easily select M = {m0 <\n2n\nm1 < ...} \u2208 P\u221e (L) such that xm\nm2n+1 \u2208 A \u2229 Hm2n for all n \u2208 N. Then \u2206C (M ) \u2286 A.\nAs A is hereditary, we see that \u2206C (M ) \u2208 A. Hence P\u221e (L) \u2229 CA 6= \u2205 and the proof\nis completed.\n\u0003\nThe following proposition is the first application of Lemma 7.\nProposition 8. Let X be a countable set and A, B \u2286 P\u221e (X) be two M-families.\nIf A and B are C-measurable, then A \u2229 B is an M-family.\nProof. Clearly we may assume that X = N. In order to show that A \u2229 B is an Mfamily we will use Fact 3(ii). So, let (Dn )n be a decreasing sequence in co(A \u2229 B).\nAs the family A \u2229 B is hereditary, there exists a sequence C = (Cn )n in A \u2229 B with\nCn \u2286 Dn for all n \u2208 N. Refining if necessary, we may assume that Cn \u2229 Cm = \u2205\nfor all n 6= m. Applying Lemma 7 successively two times, we find L \u2208 P\u221e (N)\nsuch that \u2206C (M ) \u2208 A and \u2206C (M ) \u2208 B for all M \u2208 P\u221e (L). Finally observe that\n\u2206C (M ) \u2286\u2217 Dn for every n \u2208 N and every M \u2208 P\u221e (L). The proof is completed. \u0003\nLet A, B \u2208 P\u221e (N) with A = {x0 < x1 < ...} and B = {y0 < y1 < ...} their\nincreasing enumerations. We define the diagonal product A \u2297 B of A and B by\n(10)\n\nA \u2297 B = {(xn , yn ) : n \u2208 N} \u2208 P\u221e (N \u00d7 N).\n\n\f10\n\nPANDELIS DODOS AND VASSILIS KANELLOPOULOS\n\nIf A, B \u2286 P\u221e (N) are two hereditary families, then we let\n(11)\n\nA \u2297 B = {A \u2297 B : A \u2208 A and B \u2208 B}.\n\nNotice that A \u2297 B is a hereditary subfamily of P\u221e (N \u00d7 N). We have the following.\nProposition 9. Let A, B \u2286 P\u221e (N) be two M-families. If A and B are C-measurable,\nthen A \u2297 B is an M-family.\nProof. Let (Dn )n be a decreasing sequence in co(A \u2297 B). There exist sequences\nA = (An )n and B = (Bn )n in A and B respectively such that An \u2297 Bn \u2286 Dn\nfor every n \u2208 N. As the families A and B are hereditary, we may assume that\nAn \u2229 Am = \u2205 and Bn \u2229 Bm = \u2205 for all n 6= m. For every n \u2208 N let {xn0 <\nxn1 < ...} and {y0n < y1n < ...} be the increasing enumerations of the sets An and\nBn respectively. Applying Lemma 7 successively two times, we find L \u2208 P\u221e (N)\nsuch that \u2206A (M ) \u2208 A and \u2206B (M ) \u2208 B for every M \u2208 P\u221e (L). We may select\n2n\n2k\nI = {i0 < i1 < ...} \u2208 P\u221e (L) such that xii2n\n< xii2k\nand yii2n+1\n< yii2k+1\nfor all\n2n+1\n2k+1\nn < k. It follows that\n\b\n2n\n\u2206A (I) \u2297 \u2206B (I) = (xii2n\n, yii2n+1\n):n\u2208N .\n2n+1\nHence \u2206A (I) \u2297 \u2206B (I) \u2286\u2217 Dn for every n \u2208 N and \u2206A (I) \u2297 \u2206B (I) \u2208 A \u2297 B. By\nFact 3(ii), we see that A \u2297 B is an M-family and the proof is completed.\n\u0003\nProposition 9 has some topological implications which we are about to describe.\nLet us recall, first, some definitions. Let (Y, \u03c4 ) be a (Hausdorff) topological space.\nA point y \u2208 Y is said to have the weak diagonal sequence property if for every\ndoubly indexed sequence (ykn )n,k in Y with limk ykn = y for all n \u2208 N, there exists\nL \u2208 P\u221e (N) and for every n \u2208 L a kn \u2208 N such that limn\u2208L yknn = y. The space\n(Y, \u03c4 ) has the weak diagonal sequence property if every point y \u2208 Y has it. Using\nFact 3(iii), it is easy to see that if X is a countable set, \u03c4 is a topology on X and\nx \u2208 X, then the point x has the weak diagonal sequence property in the space\n\u03c4\n(X, \u03c4 ) if and only if the family Cx = {A \u2208 P\u221e (X) : A \u2192 x} is an M-family. The\nfollowing corollary of Proposition 9 yields a positive answer to Question 5.4 from\n[TU].\nCorollary 10. Let X, Y be two countable sets and \u03c41 , \u03c42 two analytic topologies on\nX and Y respectively. Assume that both (X, \u03c41 ) and (Y, \u03c42 ) have the weak diagonal\nsequence property. Then (X \u00d7 Y, \u03c41 \u00d7 \u03c42 ) has the weak diagonal sequence property.\nProof. Clearly we may assume that X = Y = N. Let x, y \u2208 N arbitrary. As we\nhave already remarked, it is enough to show that the family\n\u03c4 \u00d7\u03c4\n\n1\n2\n(x, y)}\nC(x,y) = {C \u2208 P\u221e (N \u00d7 N) : C \u2212\u2192\n\nis an M-family. By our assumptions on \u03c41 and \u03c42 we see that the families\n\u03c4\n\n\u03c4\n\n2\n1\ny}\nx} and Cy = {B \u2208 P\u221e (N) : B \u2192\nCx = {A \u2208 P\u221e (N) : A \u2192\n\n\fON PAIRS OF DEFINABLE ORTHOGONAL FAMILIES\n\n11\n\nare both co-analytic M-families on N. It follows by Proposition 9 that the family\nCx \u2297 Cy is an M-family. Notice that Cx \u2297 Cy \u2286 C(x,y) . We let\n\b\n\b\ny\nx\nC(x,y)\n= C \u2208 C(x,y) : C \u2286 {x} \u00d7 N and C(x,y)\n= C \u2208 C(x,y) : C \u2286 N \u00d7 {y} .\ny\nx\nAs Cy and Cx are M-families, it is easy to see that so are C(x,y)\nand C(x,y)\n. It follows\nby Fact 4(ii) that the family\ny\nx\nB = C(x,y)\n\u222a C(x,y)\n\u222a (Cx \u2297 Cy )\n\nis an M-family. Now observe that B is a hereditary subfamily of C(x,y) which is\ncofinal in C(x,y) . Hence, by Fact 4(i), we conclude that C(x,y) is an M-family and\nthe proof is completed.\n\u0003\nWe notice that, after a first draft of the paper, S. Todor\u010devi\u0107 informed us that he\nwas also aware of the fact that the weak diagonal sequence property is productive\nwithin the class of countable analytic spaces.\nWe proceed by presenting another application of Lemma 7. To this end, let\nus notice that, by Fact 1, if A is a hereditary family, then A is cofinal in A\u22a5\u22a5 .\nHence, by Fact 4(i), we see that if A is an M-family, then so is A\u22a5\u22a5 . We have\nthe following strengthening of Fact 3(iii) for the family A\u22a5\u22a5 , provided that A is\nreasonably definable.\nProposition 11. Let X be a countable set and A \u2286 P\u221e (X) be an M-family and\nC-measurable. Then, for every sequence (An )n in A\u22a5\u22a5 there exists A \u2208 A\u22a5\u22a5 such\nthat A \u2229 An is infinite for infinitely many n \u2208 N.\nProof. Clearly we may assume that X = N. Let (An )n be a sequence in A\u22a5\u22a5 . By\nFact 1, we may select a sequence C = (Cn )n in A such that Cn \u2286 An for every\nn \u2208 N and Cn \u2229 Cm = \u2205 for all n 6= m. By Lemma 7, there exists L \u2208 P\u221e (N) such\nthat \u2206C (M ) \u2208 A for every M \u2208 P\u221e (L). For every n \u2208 N let {xn0 < xn1 < ...} be\nthe increasing enumeration of the set Cn . We set\n[\nA=\n{xni : i \u2208 L and i > n}.\nn\u2208L\n\nWe claim that A is the desired set. First we notice that A \u2229 Cn is infinite for every\nn \u2208 L, and so, A\u2229An is infinite for infinitely many n \u2208 N. What remains is to show\nthat A \u2208 A\u22a5\u22a5 . To this end, let B \u2208 P\u221e (A) arbitrary. It is easy to see that either\nthere exists n \u2208 L such that B \u2229 Cn is infinite, or there exists M \u2208 P\u221e (L) such\nthat \u2206C (M ) \u2286 B. As A is hereditary and \u2206C (M ) \u2208 A for every M \u2208 P\u221e (L), we\nsee that B contains an element of A. Hence, by Fact 1, we conclude that A \u2208 A\u22a5\u22a5\nand the result follows.\n\u0003\nThe following corollary is simply a restatement of Proposition 11 in the topological setting.\n\n\f12\n\nPANDELIS DODOS AND VASSILIS KANELLOPOULOS\n\nCorollary 12. Let X be a countable set and \u03c4 an analytic topology on X. Assume\nthat (X, \u03c4 ) is Fr\u00e9chet and has the weak diagonal sequence property. Let x \u2208 X and\n\u03c4\nset Cx = {A \u2208 P\u221e (X) : A \u2192 x}. Then for every sequence (An )n is Cx there exists\nA \u2208 Cx such that A \u2229 An is infinite for infinitely many n \u2208 N.\nProof. As we have already seen in Corollary 10, the family Cx is a co-analytic Mfamily. Moreover, the assumption that (X, \u03c4 ) is a Fr\u00e9chet space simply reduces to\nthe fact that Cx\u22a5\u22a5 = Cx . So the result follows by Proposition 11.\n\u0003\nWe close this section with the following result concerning the effect of the notion\nof an M-family in the context of separation of families.\nProposition 13. Let X be a countable set and A, B \u2286 P\u221e (X) be two hereditary\nfamilies. Assume that B is an M-family. Then the following are equivalent.\n(i) A and B are countably separated.\n(ii) A is countably generated in B \u22a5 .\nProof. It is clear that (ii) implies (i). So we only have to show the other implication.\nLet us fix a sequence (Cn )n in P\u221e (X) which separates A from B. For every F \u2286 N\nT\nfinite we set CF = n\u2208F Cn .\nClaim 1. For every A \u2208 A there exists F \u2286 N finite such that A \u2286 CF and\nCF \u2208 B \u22a5 .\nProof of the claim. Assume not. Thus, there exists A0 \u2208 A such that for every\nF \u2286 N finite either A0 * CF or CF \u2208\n/ B \u22a5 . Let\nL = {n \u2208 N : A0 \u2286 Cn }.\nWe claim that L is infinite. Assume not. Then A0 \u2286 CL and so, by our assumptions,\nwe get that CL \u2208\n/ B \u22a5 . Hence, there exists BL \u2208 B with BL \u2286 CL . It follows that\nfor every n \u2208 N either A0 * Cn (i.e. n \u2208\n/ L) or BL \u2286 CL \u2286 Cn . This means that\nA0 and BL cannot be separated by the sequence (Cn )n , a contradiction.\nNow let L = {l0 < l1 < ...} be the increasing enumeration of L. For every\nk \u2208 N let Dk = Cl0 \u2229 ... \u2229 Clk . Clearly (Dk )k is a decreasing sequence. By our\nassumptions we see that Dk \u2208\n/ B \u22a5 , and so, Dk \u2208 co(B) for all k \u2208 N. As B is an\nM-family, invoking Fact 3(ii) we see that there exists B0 \u2208 B such that B0 \u2286\u2217 Dk\nfor every k \u2208 N. It follows that B0 \u2286\u2217 Cn for all n \u2208 L. But then, for every n \u2208 N\nwe have that either A0 * Cn or B0 \u2286\u2217 Cn . That it, the sets A0 and B0 cannot be\nseparated by the sequence (Cn )n , a contradiction again. The claim is proved. \u2666\nBy the above claim, for every A \u2208 A there exists FA \u2286 N finite with CFA \u2208 B \u22a5 and\nA \u2286 CFA . The family {CFA : A \u2208 A} is clearly countable, and so, A is countably\ngenerated in B \u22a5 . The proof is completed.\n\u0003\n\n\fON PAIRS OF DEFINABLE ORTHOGONAL FAMILIES\n\n13\n\n5. Proof of Theorem I\nThis section is devoted to the proof of Theorem I stated in the introduction. So,\nlet A, B \u2286 P\u221e (N) be a pair of hereditary orthogonal families such that A is \u03a311\nand B is C-measurable and an M-family. Assume that (i) does not hold, i.e. A is\nnot countably generated in B \u22a5 . We will find a perfect Lusin gap inside (A, B).\nBy Theorem 4, there exists a one-to-one map \u03c6 : \u03a3 \u2192 N such that, setting\nE = {\u03c6\u22121 (A) : A \u2208 A} and H = {\u03c6\u22121 (B) : B \u2208 B},\nproperties (i) and (ii) of Theorem 4 are satisfied for E and H. In what follows, we\nwill work inside the tree \u03a3 and with the families E and H. Denote by C the family\nof all infinite chains of \u03a3. That is\n\b\nC = C \u2208 P\u221e (\u03a3) : \u2203\u03c3 \u2208 [\u03a3] with C \u2286 {\u03c3|n : n \u2208 N} .\nClearly C is a \u03a002 hereditary family. We notice the following properties of the\nfamilies E and H.\n(P1)\n(P2)\n(P3)\n(P4)\n\nE and H are hereditary and orthogonal.\nE is analytic and C \u2286 E.\nH is C-measurable and an M-family.\n\b\nFor every t \u2208 \u03a3, t \u222a {n} : n \u2208 N and t < {n} \u2208 H.\n\nProperties (P1)-(P4) are rather straightforward consequences of the the way the\nfamilies E and H are defined and of the fact that the map \u03c6 is one-to-one.\nWe are going to define a class of subsets of \u03a3 which will play a decisive role in\nthe proof of Theorem I.\nDefinition 14. Let \u03c3 \u2208 [\u03a3] and D \u2208 P\u221e (\u03a3). We say that D descends to \u03c3,\nin symbols D \u2193 \u03c3, if for every k \u2208 N the set D is almost included in the set\n{t \u2208 \u03a3 : \u03c3|k \u2291 t}. We call such a set D a descender.\nWe also need to introduce some notations. Let B be the set of all block sequences\nof \u03a3. For every b = (bn )n \u2208 B we set\n[\n(12)\n\u03a3b = {t \u2208 \u03a3 : \u2203b \u2208 hbi with t \u2291 b} and \u03c3b =\nbn\nn\n\nwhere the set hbi was defined in \u00a72.2. Clearly \u03a3b is a downwards closed subtree of\n\u03a3. Notice that \u03c3b is just the leftmost branch of the tree \u03a3b . We also observe the\nfollowing.\n(O1) The set [\u03a3b ] of all branches of \u03a3b is in one-to-one correspondence with the\nsubsequences of b = (bn )n . In particular, for every \u03c3 \u2208 [\u03a3b ] there exists a\nunique subsequence (bln )n of (bn )n , which we shall denote by b\u03c3 , such that\nS\n\u03c3 = n bln . Moreover, the map [\u03a3b ] \u220b \u03c3 7\u2192 b\u03c3 \u2208 [b] is continuous.\n(O2) If c \u2208 [b], then \u03a3c is a downwards closed subtree of \u03a3b .\n\n\f14\n\nPANDELIS DODOS AND VASSILIS KANELLOPOULOS\n\nWe define \u2206 : B \u2192 P\u221e (\u03a3) by\n(13)\n\n3n\no\n[\n\u0001 n\nbi \u222a {min b3n+2 }, ... .\n\u2206 (bn )n = b0 \u222a {min b2 }, ...,\ni=0\n\nWe notice the following.\n(O3) The map \u2206 is continuous.\n(O4) For every block sequence b = (bn )n the set \u2206(b) is a subset of the tree\nS\n\u03a3b , is a descender and descends to the leftmost branch \u03c3b = n bn of \u03a3b .\nMoreover, the sets {\u03c3b |n : n \u2208 N} and \u2206(b) are disjoint.\nThe following lemma is a consequence of Theorem 2 and of the fact that H is an\nM-family. It can be considered as a parameterized version of Lemma 7. We notice\nthat the arguments in its proof follow similar lines as in [ADK, Lemma 44].\nLemma 15. There exists b \u2208 B such that \u2206(c) \u2208 H for all c \u2208 [b].\nProof. We let\nX = {c \u2208 B : \u2206(c) \u2208 H}.\nThen X is a C-measurable subset of [B]. By Theorem 2, there exists b = (bn )n \u2208 B\nsuch that [b] is monochromatic. We claim that [b] \u2286 X . To this end, we argue as\nS\nfollows. For every n \u2208 N we set tn = k\u2264n bk \u2208 \u03a3 and\n\b\nAn = tn \u222a {min bi } : i > n + 1 \u2208 P\u221e (\u03a3).\n\b\nThe set An is a subset of the set tn \u222a {m} : m \u2208 N and tn < {m} which, by\nproperty (P4) above, belongs to H. As the family H is hereditary, we see that\nAn \u2208 H for all n \u2208 N. Invoking the fact that H is an M-family and Fact 3(iii),\nwe find A \u2208 H such that A \u2229 An 6= \u2205 for infinitely many n \u2208 N. We may select\nL = {l0 < l1 < ...}, M = {i0 < i1 < ...} \u2208 P\u221e (N) with ln + 1 < in < ln+1 and\nsuch that tln \u222a {min bin } \u2208 A \u2229 Aln for all n \u2208 N. We set sn = tln \u222a {min bin } for\nall n \u2208 N. It follows that {sn : n \u2208 N} \u2208 H, as {sn : n \u2208 N} \u2286 A \u2208 H and H is\nhereditary.\nS\nNow we define c = (cn )n \u2208 [b] as follows. We set c0 = k\u2264l0 bn (i.e. c0 = tl0 ),\nc1 = bl0 +1 \u222a ... \u222a bi0 \u22121 and c2 = bi0 . For every n \u2265 1 we let In = [in\u22121 + 1, ln ] and\nJn = [ln + 1, in \u2212 1] and we set\n[\n[\nbk and c3n+2 = bin .\nbk , c3n+1 =\nc3n =\nk\u2208In\n\nk\u2208Jn\n\nClearly c \u2208 [b] and it is easy to see that \u2206(c) = {sn : n \u2208 N}. Thus, \u2206(c) \u2208 H. It\nfollows that [b] \u2229 X 6= \u2205. Hence [b] \u2286 X and the lemma is proved.\n\u0003\nLet b = (bn )n be the block sequence obtained by Lemma 15. We set\n\u0001\n\b\n(14)\nF = A \u2208 P\u221e (\u03a3) : \u2203(bln )n subsequence of (bn )n with A \u2286 \u2206 (bln )n .\nBy property (P1), the family H is hereditary. Hence, using the continuity of the\nmap \u2206 and the fact that \u2206(c) \u2208 H for every c \u2208 [b] we see that\n\n\fON PAIRS OF DEFINABLE ORTHOGONAL FAMILIES\n\n15\n\n(P5) F is a hereditary analytic subfamily of H.\nConsider now the tree \u03a3b corresponding to b as it was defined in (12) above and\nlet \u03c3 \u2208 [\u03a3b ] arbitrary. By (O1), there exists a subsequence b\u03c3 = (bln )n of (bn )n\n\u0001\nS\nsuch that \u03c3 = n bln . By (O4) and (O2), we get that \u2206 (bln )n \u2286 \u03a3b\u03c3 \u2286 \u03a3b .\n\u0001\nMoreover, the set \u2206 (bln )n descends to \u03c3 and, by definition, belongs to the family\nF . Hence, summarizing, we arrive to the the following property of F .\n(P6) For every \u03c3 \u2208 [\u03a3b ] there exists D \u2208 F with D \u2286 \u03a3b and D \u2193 \u03c3.\nWe have the following lemma, which is essentially a consequence of property (P6).\nLemma 16. The families C and F are not countably separated.\nProof. Assume, towards a contradiction, that there exists a sequence (Ck )k in\nP\u221e (\u03a3) such that for every C \u2208 C and every B \u2208 F there exists k \u2208 N with\nC \u2286 Ck and Ck \u22a5 B. For every k let\n\b\nFk = \u03c3 \u2208 [\u03a3b ] : {\u03c3|n : n \u2208 N} \u2286 Ck .\nS\nThen each Fk is a closed subset of [\u03a3b ]. Moreover [\u03a3b ] = k Fk .\nFor every t \u2208 \u03a3b and every k \u2208 N there exists s \u2208 \u03a3b with t \u228f s and such that\neither Vs \u2229 Fk = \u2205 or Vs \u2286 Fk , where as usual by Vs we denote the clopen subset\n{\u03c3 \u2208 [\u03a3b ] : s \u228f \u03c3} of [\u03a3b ]. Let us say that such a node s decides for (t, k). Observe\nthat if s decides for (t, k) with Vs \u2286 Fk , then the set {w \u2208 \u03a3b : s \u2291 w} is a subset\nof Ck .\nRecursively, we select a sequence (sk )k in \u03a3b such that s0 decides for (\u2205, 0)\nand sk+1 decides for (sk , k + 1) for all k \u2208 N. Notice that sk \u228f sk+1 . Thus,\nS\nsetting \u03c4 = k sk , we see that \u03c4 \u2208 [\u03a3b ]. By property (P6) above, there exists\nB0 \u2208 F with B0 \u2286 \u03a3b and B0 \u2193 \u03c4 . Now let m \u2208 N with {\u03c4 |n : n \u2208 N} \u2286 Cm .\nThen \u03c4 \u2208 Fm . As sm \u228f \u03c4 , we see that Vsm \u2229 Fm 6= \u2205. The node sm decides for\nevery m \u2208 N, and so, Vsm \u2286 Fm . As we have already remarked, this implies that\n{w \u2208 \u03a3b : sm \u2291 w} \u2286 Cm . As B0 descends to \u03c4 , B0 \u2286 \u03a3b and sm \u228f \u03c4 we get\nB0 \u2286\u2217 {w \u2208 \u03a3b : sm \u2291 w} \u2286 Cm .\nSummarizing, we see that for all m \u2208 N either {\u03c4 |n : n \u2208 N} * Cm or B0 \u2286\u2217 Cm .\nThat is, the sequence (Ck )k cannot separate the sets {\u03c4 |n : n \u2208 N} and B0 although\n{\u03c4 |n : n \u2208 N} \u2208 C and B0 \u2208 F , a contradiction. The lemma is proved.\n\u0003\nThe families C and F are hereditary, analytic and orthogonal. Thus, applying Theorem 3 to the pair (C, F ) and by Lemma 16, we get that there exists a\nperfect Lusin gap inside (C, F ). As C \u2286 E and F \u2286 H, we see that there exists a perfect Lusin gap 2N \u220b x 7\u2192 (Ax , Bx ) inside (E, H). Now recall that the\nmap \u03c6 : \u03a3 \u2192 N obtained by Theorem 4 is one-to-one. It follows that the map\n\u0001\n2N \u220b x 7\u2192 \u03c6(Ax ), \u03c6(Bx ) is a perfect Lusin gap inside (A, B). The proof of Theorem I is completed.\n\n\f16\n\nPANDELIS DODOS AND VASSILIS KANELLOPOULOS\n\nRemark 1. We would like to point out that one can construct the perfect Lusin\ngap inside (E, H) without invoking Theorem 3. This can be done as follows. Let\nb = (bn )n be the block sequence obtained by Lemma 15. First we construct,\nrecursively, a family (ts )s\u22082<N in \u03a3b such that the following are satisfied.\n(C1) For every s, s\u2032 \u2208 2<N we have s \u228f s\u2032 if and only if ts \u228f ts\u2032 .\n(C2) For every s \u2208 2<N and every \u03c3 \u2208 [\u03a3b ] with tsa 0 \u228f \u03c3 we have tsa 1 \u2208 \u2206(b\u03c3 ),\nwhere, as in (O1) above, by b\u03c3 we denote the unique subsequence (bln )n of\nS\n(bn )n such that \u03c3 = n bln .\n\nThe construction proceeds as follows. We set t\u2205 = \u2205. Assume that ts has been\ndefined for some s \u2208 2<N . We select \u03c4 \u2208 \u03a3b with ts \u228f \u03c4 . Let b\u03c4 = (bln )n be the\nS\nunique subsequence of b with \u03c4 = n bln . By (O4) in the proof of Theorem I, the\nset \u2206(b\u03c4 ) descends to \u03c4 . As ts \u228f \u03c4 , there exists tsa 1 \u2208 \u2206(b\u03c4 ) with ts \u228f tsa 1 .\nThe map [\u03a3b ] \u220b \u03c3 7\u2192 \u2206(b\u03c3 ) \u2208 P\u221e (\u03a3) is continuous. So, we may find a node tsa 0\nincomparable to tsa 1 with ts \u228f tsa 0 \u228f \u03c4 and such that (C2) above is satisfied.\nS\nHaving completed the construction, for every x \u2208 2N let \u03c3x = n tx|n \u2208 [\u03a3b ] and\ndefine\nAx = {\u03c3x |n : n \u2208 N} \u2208 E and Bx = \u2206(b\u03c3x ) \u2208 H.\nThe perfect Lusin gap inside (E, H) is the map 2N \u220b x 7\u2192 (Ax , Bx ). It is easy to\ncheck that it is one-to-one, continuous and Ax \u2229 Bx = \u2205 for all x \u2208 2N . Finally\nlet x, y \u2208 2N with x 6= y. We may assume that x < y, where < stands for the\nlexicographical ordering of 2N . There exists s \u2208 2<N with sa 0 \u228f x and sa 1 \u228f y.\nThen tsa 1 \u2208 Ay . Moreover, we have tsa 0 \u228f \u03c3x . By (C2) above, we see that\ntsa 1 \u2208 \u2206(b\u03c3x ). Thus Ay \u2229 Bx 6= \u2205.\nRemark 2. Let A, B \u2286 P\u221e (N) be two hereditary, orthogonal, analytic families\nand assume that B is an M-family. We notice that, in this case, the dichotomy in\nTheorem I can be derived directly by Theorem 3. To see this, observe that if A is\nnot countably generated in B \u22a5 , then, by Proposition 13, the families A and B are\nnot countably separated. Thus, part (ii) of Theorem 3 yields the existence of the\ngap inside (A, B).\n\nRemark 3. As in Example 3, let E be a Polish space and f = {fn }n be a pointwise\nbounded sequence of real-valued Baire-1 functions on E such that the closure K of\n{fn }n in RE is a Rosenthal compact. We set\n\b\n(15)\nLf = L \u2208 P\u221e (N) : (fn )n\u2208L is pointwise convergent .\nFor every f \u2208 K let also Lf be as in (6). In [To4, Lemmas G.9 and G.10], S.\nTodor\u010devi\u0107 proved that if f is any point of K, then either\n(A1) f is a G\u03b4 point of K, or\n(A2) there exists a perfect Lusin gap in (Lf \\ Lf , Lf ).\nLet us see how Theorem I yields the above dichotomy. So, fix a point f \u2208 K. First\nwe notice that, as it was explained in [Do, Remark 1(2)], by Debs' theorem [De]\n\n\fON PAIRS OF DEFINABLE ORTHOGONAL FAMILIES\n\n17\n\nthere exists a hereditary, Borel and cofinal subfamily F of Lf . We set A = F \\ Lf .\nThen A is an analytic, hereditary and cofinal subfamily of Lf \\ Lf . Moreover, as\nwe mentioned in Example 3, the family Lf is a co-analytic M-family. Noticing that\nA and Lf are orthogonal, by Theorem I we get that either\n(A3) A is countably generated in L\u22a5\nf , or\n(A4) there exists a perfect Lusin gap in (A, Lf ).\nClearly, we only have to check that (A3) implies (A1). Indeed, let (Lk )k be a\np\nsequence in L\u22a5\nf that generates A. Set Vk = K \\ {fn }n\u2208Lk and notice that f \u2208 Vk\nfor every k \u2208 N. Taking into account that A is cofinal in Lf \\ Lf and using the\nT\nBourgain-Fremlin-Talagrand theorem [BFT], we see that {f } = k Vk ; that is the\npoint f is G\u03b4 .\n6. Proof of Theorem II\nThis section is devoted to the proof of Theorem II. Let A, B \u2286 P\u221e (N) be a pair\nof hereditary orthogonal families such that A is analytic and B is C-measurable and\nan M-family. Assume that A is not countably generated in B \u22a5 . By Theorem 4,\nthere exists a one-to-one map \u03c6 : \u03a3 \u2192 N such that, setting E = {\u03c6\u22121 (A) : A \u2208 A}\nand H = {\u03c6\u22121 (B) : B \u2208 B}, the following properties are satisfied for E and H.\n(P1)\n(P2)\n(P3)\n(P4)\n\nE and H are hereditary and orthogonal.\nE is analytic and C \u2286 E.\nH is C-measurable and an M-family.\n\b\nFor every t \u2208 \u03a3, t \u222a {n} : n \u2208 N and t < {n} \u2208 H.\n\nAs in the proof of Theorem I, we shall work inside the tree \u03a3 and with the families\nE and H.\nWe introduce the following class of subsets of \u03a3. It will be used in a similar\nmanner as the class of descenders was used in the proof of Theorem I.\nDefinition 17. An infinite subset F of \u03a3 will be called a fan if F can be enumerated\nas {tn : n \u2208 N} and there exist s \u2208 \u03a3 and a strictly increasing sequence (mn )n in\nN with s < {m0 } and such that s \u222a {mn } \u2291 tn for all n \u2208 N.\nThe following fact is essentially well-known. We sketch a proof for completeness.\nFact 5. Let A \u2208 P\u221e (\u03a3). Then either A is dominated, or A contains a fan. In\nparticular, if T is a downwards closed, well-founded, infinite subtree of \u03a3, then\nevery infinite subset A of T contains a fan.\nProof. Fix A \u2208 P\u221e (\u03a3) and let \u00c2 = {t \u2208 \u03a3 : \u2203s \u2208 A with t \u2291 s} be the downwards\nclosure of A. It is easy to see that if \u00c2 is finitely splitting, then A must be dominated\nwhile if \u00c2 is not finitely splitting, then A must contain a fan.\nFor the second part, let T be a downwards closed, well-founded, infinite subtree\nof \u03a3 and fix A \u2208 P\u221e (T ). If \u00c2 is finitely splitting, then by an application of K\u00f6nig's\n\n\f18\n\nPANDELIS DODOS AND VASSILIS KANELLOPOULOS\n\nlemma we see that [T ] 6= \u2205, a contradiction. Thus \u00c2 is not finitely splitting, and\nso, A contains a fan.\n\u0003\nNotice that if b = (bn )n is a block sequence of \u03a3 and s \u2208 \u03a3 with s < b0 , then\nthe set {s \u222a bn : n \u2208 N} is a fan. A fan F of this form will be called a block fan. By\nFBlock we denote the set of all block fans of \u03a3. We have the following elementary\nfact.\nFact 6. Every fan contains a block fan.\nWe define \u03a6 : B \u2192 P\u221e (\u03a3) by\n\u0001 \b\n(16)\n\u03a6 (bn )n = b0 \u222a b1 \u222a {min b2 }, ..., b0 \u222a b2n+1 \u222a {min b2n+2 }, ... .\nWe observe the following.\n(O1) The map \u03a6 is continuous.\n(O2) For every b \u2208 B the set \u03a6(b) is a block fan.\nWe have the following analogue of Lemma 15.\nLemma 18. There exists b \u2208 B such that \u03a6(c) \u2208 H for all c \u2208 [b].\nProof. We let\nX = {c \u2208 B : \u03a6(c) \u2208 H}.\nThen X is a C-measurable subset of B. Hence, by Theorem 2, there exists b =\n(bn )n \u2208 B such that [b] is monochromatic. We claim that [b] \u2286 X . Indeed, for\nevery n \u2265 1 let\n\b\nAn = b0 \u222a bn \u222a {min bk } : k > n \u2208 P\u221e (\u03a3).\n\b\nThe set An is a subset of the set b0 \u222a bn \u222a {m} : m \u2208 N and bn < {m} which, by\nproperty (P4), belongs to H. Hence, by (P1), An \u2208 H for all n \u2208 N. As H is an\nM-family, by Fact 3(iii), we may select L = {l0 < l1 < ...}, M = {m0 < m1 < ...} \u2208\nP\u221e (N) with 1 \u2264 ln < mn < ln+1 for all n \u2208 N and such that\n\b\nb0 \u222a bln \u222a {min bmn } : n \u2208 N \u2208 H.\nWe define c = (cn )n by c0 = b0 and c2n+1 = bln , c2n+2 = bmn for every n \u2208 N.\nThen c \u2208 [b] and \u03a6(c) = {b0 \u222a bln \u222a {min bmn } : n \u2208 N} \u2208 H. Hence, [b] \u2229 X 6= \u2205\nand the result follows.\n\u0003\nLet b = (bn )n be the block sequence obtained by Lemma 18. We are going to\nselect a subset of \u03a3 by defining an appropriate endomorphism of \u03a3 (the desired\nsubset will be the image of this endomorphism). In particular, we define h : \u03a3 \u2192 \u03a3\nas follows.\n(a) We set h(\u2205) = \u2205.\n\u0001\n(b) If t = (n) with n \u2208 N, we set h (n) = b0 \u222a b2n+1 \u222a {min b2n+2 }.\n\n\fON PAIRS OF DEFINABLE ORTHOGONAL FAMILIES\n\n19\n\n(c) If t = (n0 < ... < nk ) \u2208 \u03a3 with k \u2265 1, we set\nh(t) = b0 \u222a\n\n\u0010 k\u22121\n[\n\n\u0011\n(b2ni +1 \u222a b2ni +2 ) \u222a b2nk +1 \u222a {min b2nk +2 }.\n\ni=0\n\nIt is easy to see that the map h is well-defined and one-to-one. We also observe the\nfollowing.\n(O3) For every s, t \u2208 \u03a3 we have s \u228f t if and only if h(s) \u228f h(t). Thus, if\nC \u2208 P\u221e (\u03a3), then C is a chain of \u03a3 if and only if h(C) is.\nThe following fact shows the relation between the maps \u03a6 and h.\nFact 7. Let F be a block fan of \u03a3. Then there exists c \u2208 [b] such that h(F ) = \u03a6(c).\nProof. Let (un )n be a block sequence of \u03a3 and s \u2208 \u03a3 with s < u0 and such that\nF = {s\u222aun : n \u2208 N}. For every n \u2208 N there exist sn \u2208 \u03a3 and ln \u2208 N with sn < {ln }\nand un = sn \u222a {ln } (notice that sn may be empty). We define c = (cn )n \u2208 B as\nfollows. We let\n[\nc0 = b 0 \u222a\n(b2k+1 \u222a b2k+2 )\nk\u2208s\n\nS\nwith the convention that k\u2208s (b2k+1 \u222a b2k+2 ) = \u2205 if s = \u2205. For every n \u2265 1 we set\n\u0010 [\n\u0011\nc2n+1 =\n(b2k+1 \u222a b2k+2 ) \u222a b2ln +1 and c2n+2 = b2ln +2 .\nk\u2208sn\n\nIt is easy to see that c \u2208 [b] and h(F ) = \u03a6(c), as desired.\n\u0003\n\u0001\nFinally, we define \u03c8 : \u03a3 \u2192 N by \u03c8(s) = \u03c6 h(s) for all s \u2208 \u03a3. Both \u03c6 and h are\none-to-one, and so, the map \u03c8 is one-to-one too. As in Example 2, let Iwf be the\nideal on \u03a3 generated by the set WF of all downwards closed, well-founded, infinite\nsubtrees of \u03a3. That is Iwf = {W \u2208 P\u221e (\u03a3) : \u2203T \u2208 WF with W \u2286 T }.\nLemma 19. The following hold.\n(i) C \u2286 {\u03c8 \u22121 (A) : A \u2208 A}.\n(ii) FBlock \u2286 {\u03c8 \u22121 (B) : B \u2208 B}.\n(iii) Iwf \u2286 {\u03c8 \u22121 (B) : B \u2208 B \u22a5\u22a5 }.\nProof. Part (i) is an immediate consequence of property (P2) and observation (O3)\nabove. Part (ii) follows by Lemma 18 and Fact 7. To see part (iii), fix W \u2208 Iwf .\nLet A \u2208 P\u221e (W ) arbitrary. By Facts 5 and 6, there exists a block fan F with\nF \u2286 A. By part (ii), we see that \u03c8(F ) \u2208 B. Hence, by Fact 1, we conclude that\n\u03c8(W ) \u2208 B \u22a5\u22a5 , as desired.\n\u0003\nThe trees \u03a3 and N<N are isomorphic, i.e. there exists a bijection e : N<N \u2192 \u03a3\nwith |e(t)| = |t| for all t \u2208 N<N and such that t1 \u228f t2 in N<N if and only if\ne(t1 ) \u228f e(t2 ). Hence, by Lemma 19, the proof of Theorem II is completed.\nRemark 4. In [Kr], A. Krawczyk proved that if I is a bisequential analytic ideal\non N, then either,\n\n\f20\n\nPANDELIS DODOS AND VASSILIS KANELLOPOULOS\n\n(A1) I is countably generated in I, or\n(A2) there exists a one-to-one map \u03c8 : N<N \u2192 N such that, setting J =\n{\u03c8 \u22121 (A) : A \u2208 I}, we have that C \u2286 J \u2286 Id ,\nwhere C denotes the set of all infinite chains of N<N while Id denotes the ideal of\nall infinite dominated subsets of N<N . Let us see how Theorem II yields the above\nresult. So, fix a bisequential analytic ideal I on N. We set A = I and B = I \u22a5 .\nClearly A and B are hereditary and orthogonal families. Moreover, A is \u03a311 while\nB is \u03a011 . By Proposition 6(ii), we see that B is an M-family. By Fact 2, the ideal\nI has the Fr\u00e9chet property, and so, B \u22a5 = I and B \u22a5\u22a5 = I \u22a5 = B. Thus, applying\nTheorem II, the result follows.\nRemark 5. Let A and B be as in Theorem II and assume that A is not countably\ngenerated in B \u22a5 . Let \u03c8 : N<N \u2192 N be the one-to-one map obtained by Theorem\nII. Notice that for every downwards closed, infinite subtree T of N<N we have\nthat T \u2208 WF if and only if \u03c8(T ) \u2208 B \u22a5\u22a5 , i.e. the set WF is Wadge reducible to\nB \u22a5\u22a5 . Thus, if A is not countably generated in B \u22a5 , then the family B \u22a5\u22a5 is at least\n\u03a011 -hard.\nReferences\n[ADK] S. A. Argyros, P. Dodos and V.
