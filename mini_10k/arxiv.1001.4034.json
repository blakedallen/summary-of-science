In the case that such geometries actually exist\nthey could show some interesting peculiarities as, for example, the possibility of using them for time travel [3, 4].\nA basic difficulty with wormholes is that the flare-out\ncondition [5] to be satisfied at the throat requires the\npresence of matter which violates the energy conditions\n(\"exotic matter\") [1, 2, 5, 6]. It was recently shown [7],\nhowever, that the amount of exotic matter necessary for\nsupporting a wormhole geometry can be made infinitesimally small. Thus, in subsequent works special attention has been devoted to quantifying the amount of exotic matter [8, 9], and this measure of the exoticity has\nbeen pointed as an indicator of the physical viability of\na traversable wormhole [10].\nA central aspect of any solution of the equations of\ngravitation is its mechanical stability. The stability of\nwormholes has been thoroughly studied for the case of\nsmall perturbations preserving the original symmetry of\nthe configurations. In particular, Poisson and Visser [11]\ndeveloped a straightforward approach for analyzing this\naspect for thin-shell wormholes, that is, those which are\nmathematically constructed by cutting and pasting two\nmanifolds to obtain a new manifold [12]. In these wormholes the associated supporting matter is located on a\nshell placed at the joining surface; so the theoretical tools\nfor treating them is the Darmois\u2013Israel formalism, which\nleads to the Lanczos equations [13, 14]. The solution of\nthe Lanczos equations gives the dynamical evolution of\nthe wormhole once an equation of state for the matter\non the shell is provided. Such a procedure has been subsequently followed to study the stability of more general\nspherically symmetric configurations (see, for example,\nRefs. [15]).\n\na Electronic\n\naddress: martin@df.uba.ar\n\nWormholes in theories beyond Einstein framework\nhave gained a lot of interest in the last years because they\nseem to possess some curious properties regarding the\nkind of matter which could support them. A few examples of these alternatives theories are the Einstein\u2013GaussBonnet picture [16\u201318], scalar-tensor theories [19, 20],\nF (R)-theory or massive gravity [21]. In particular, for\nthe Einstein\u2013Gauss\u2013Bonnet theory, it was shown that\nstatic thin-shell wormholes could be supported by ordinary matter respecting the energy conditions[16]. Moroever, C 2 -type womholes with the latter property can\nalso exist once the nonlinear Gauss-Bonnet term is included in the field equations [17]. Of course, this feature\nis not only exclusive of the Gauss-Bonnet paradigms; being the Brans-Dicke gravity another set up where the\nthin-shell wormholes fulfil weak and null energy conditions [19].\nIn addition, a new type of gravitational model was\nwidely studied in the context of cosmology as well as\nparticle physics, the so called Dvali, Gabadadze and Porrati (DGP) theory. It predicts deviations from the standard 4D gravity over large distances. The transition between four and higher-dimensional gravitational potentials in the DGP model arises because of the presence of\nboth the brane and bulk Hilbert\u2013Einstein (H\u2013E) terms in\nthe action [22]. Cosmological considerations of the DGP\nmodel were first discussed in [23, 24] where it was shown\nthat in a Minkowski bulk spacetime we can obtain selfaccelerating solutions. In the original DGP model it is\nknown that 4D general relativity is not recovered at linearized level. However, some authors have shown that at\nshort distances we can recover the 4D general relativity\nin a spherically symmetric configuration (see for example\n[25]).\nIt is worth mentioning that an interesting feature of\nthe original DGP model is the existence of ghost-like\nexcitations [26, 28]. Further, the viability of the selfaccelerating cosmological solution in the DGP gravity\nwas carefully studied in [27]. For a comprehensive review of the existence of 4D ghosts on the self-accelerating\nbranch of solutions in DGP models see [29].\nA common feature amongs alternative theories is that\nthe junction conditions for the thin-shell wormholes are\nmodified considerably, adding new types of geometrical\n\n\f2\nobjects besides the usual extrinsic curvature. The contributions form the curvature tensors, theoretically, seem\nto allow the existence of wormholes supported by ordinary matter. For all these reasons, we consider that the\nconstruction of wormholes within DGP gravity deserves\nto be examined in detail to conclude whether or not they\ncould fulfill the energy conditions.\nIn this work we explore thin-shell wormholes within\nthe DGP gravity theory. Our research is focus on configurations supporting by non-exotic matter which satisfy\nthe energy conditions. Then, we show the existence of\nsolitonic vacuum shells and make some comment about\ntheir dynamic.\n\nII.\n\nFIVE-DIMENSIONAL BULK SOLUTION\n\nWe start from the action for the DGP theory in fivedimensional manifold M5 with four-dimensional boundary \u2202M5 = \u03a3 (cf. [28]),\nZ\nZ\n\u221a\n\u221a\nd5 x \u2212gR(g\u03bc\u03bd ) +\nS = 2M53\nd4 x \u2212\u03b32M42 R(\u03b3ab )\nM5\n\u03a3\nZ\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u221a\nd4 x \u2212\u03b3 \u2212 4M53 K(\u03b3ab ) + Lm ,\n+\n\u03a3\n\nwhere g\u03bc\u03bd is the five-dimensional metric, \u03b3ab is the fourdimensional induced metric on the boundary \u03a3, and K\nis the trace of extrinsic curvature. The extra term in the\nboundary introduces a mass scale mc = 2M53 /M42 = rc\u22121 ,\nthat is, the model has one adjustable parameter, namely\nmc which determines a scale that separates two different\nregimes of the theory. For distances much smaller than\nm\u22121\none would expect the solutions to be well approxic\nmated by General Relativity and the modifications to appear at larger distances. This is indeed the case for distributions of matter and radiation which are homogeneous\nand isotropic at scales >\n\u223c rc . Tipically, mc \u223c 10.42GeV,\nso it sets the distance/time scale rc = m\u22121\nat which the\nc\nNewtonian potential significantly deviates from the conventional one [33].\nIt is a well known fact that the DGP scheme is a fivedimensional model where gravity propagates throughout\nan infinite bulk, and matter fields in Lm are confined\nto a 4-dimensional boundary. The action for gravity at\nlowest order in the derivate expansion is a bulk EinsteinHilbert term and a boundary one, generically with two\ndifferent planck masses M5 , M4 , plus a suitable GibbonsHawking term. In the bulk the DGP equations are the\n(5)\nEinstein ones in vacuum: G\u03bc\u03bd = 0. Then in this case,\nthe Birkhoff's theorem forces the bulk metric to be static,\nand of the Schwarzschild form:\nds2 = \u2212f (r)dt2 +\n\u03bc\nf (r) = 1 \u2212 2\nr\n\n1\ndr2 + r2 d\u03a923 ,\nf (r)\n\nwhere the parameter \u03bc is related to the five dimensional Arnowitt\u2013Deser\u2013Misner (ADM) mass, MADM =\n3\u03c0 2 \u03bcM53 . The above spacetime has only one horizon\n\u221a\nplaced at r+ = \u03bc with \u03bc > 0. Besides, when \u03bc < 0\nthe manifold only presents a naked singularity at the origin r = 0.\n\nIII.\nA.\n\nWORMHOLES IN DGP\nThin-shell construction\n\nEmploying the metric Eqs.(1-2) we build a spherically\nthin-shell wormhole in DGP theory. we take two copies\nof the spacetime amd remove from each manifold the fivedimensional regions described by\nM\u00b1 = {x/r\u00b1 \u2264 a, a > rh } .\n\n(3)\n\nThe resulting manifolds have boundaries given by the\ntimelike hypersurfaces\n\u03a3\u00b1 = {x/r\u00b1 = a, a > rh } .\n\n(4)\n\nThen we identify these two timelike hypersurfaces to obtain a geodesically complete new manifold M = M+ \u222a\nM\u2212 . We take values of a large enough to avoid the presence of singularities and horizons in the case that the geometry (2) has any of them. The manifold M repesents\na wormhole with a throat placed at the surface r = a,\nwhere the matter supporting the configuration is located.\nThis manifold is constituted by two regions which are\nasymptotically flat (see Fig. 1). The wormholes throat\n\u03a3 is a synchronous timelike hypersurface, where we define locally a chart with coordinates \u03be a = (\u03c4, , \u03c7, \u03b8, \u03c6),\nwith \u03c4 the proper time on the shell. Though we shall\nfirst focus in static configurations, in the susbsequent we\ncould allow the radius of the throat be a function of the\nproper time for studying the dynamics evolution of the\nwormholes, then in general we have that the boundary\nhypersurface reads:\n\u03a3 : H(r, \u03c4 ) = r \u2212 a(\u03c4 ) = 0.\n\n(5)\n\nIt is important to remark that the geometry remains\nstatic outside the throat, regardless the radius a(\u03c4 ) can\nvary with time, so no gravitational waves are present.This\nis naturally guaranteed because the Birkhoff theorem\nholds for the original manifold.\nOur starting point is to list the main geometric objects which shall appear in the junction condition associated with the field equation for \u03a3. The extrinsic curvature,namely Kab , associated with the two sides of the\nshell are defined as follows:\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\n\u00b1\nKab\n= \u2212n\u00b1\n\u03ba\n\n\u0012\n\n\u22022X \u03ba\n\u2202X \u03bc \u2202X \u03bd\n+ \u0393\u03ba\u03bc\u03bd\na\nb\n\u2202\u03be \u2202\u03be\n\u2202\u03be a \u2202\u03be b\n\n\u0013\n\nr=a\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\n\f3\nwhere dot means derivate with respect to the proper time\non \u03a3. The extrinsic curvature components read\n\nM\n\nK00\n\n+\n\nKi j\n\nS ab = diag (\u2212\u03c3, p \u03b4 ij )\n\n-\n\nFIG. 1: We show the wormhole geometry obtained after performing the cut and paste procedure. The shell on \u03a3 is located\nat the throat radius r = a.\n\n\u03ba\nwhere n\u00b1\n\u03ba are the unit normals (n\u03ba n = 1) to the surface\n\u03a3 in M:\n\u03bc\u03bd\nn\u00b1\n\u03ba =\u00b1 g\n\n\u2202H \u2202H \u2202H\n\u2202X \u03bc \u2202X \u03bd \u2202X \u03ba\n\n(7)\n\nThe field equations projected on the shell \u03a3 are the\ngeneralized junction (or Darmois\u2013Israel) conditions [28,\n29]\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\nSab\nrc Rab \u2212 \u03b3ab R \u2212 2 hKab \u2212 K\u03b3ab i =\n,\n2\n8M53\n\n(12)\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u03c3 is the energy density and p is the pressure. Replacing Eqs(10-13) into the DGP junction condition(8)\nwe obtain that the energy density and the pressure can\nbe recast as\n\u0010 \u02272\n\u03c3\n1 \u0011 12 p\nf (a) + \u02272 ,\n(14)\n= 3rc 2 + 2 \u2212\n3\n8M5\na\na\na\n\u0010 \u02272\np\n1\n2\u00e4 \u0011 8 p\nf (a) + \u02272 (15)\n+\n= \u2212rc 2 + 2 +\n3\n8M5\na\na\na\na\n2\u00e4 + f \u2032\n+ 2p\n.\n(16)\nf (a) + \u02272\n\nwhere the DGP contributions are encoded in the rc factor of the above equations. If we take rc \u2192 0 in both\nequations (14) and (15) we recover the expression for the\nenergy density \u03c3 and the pressure p found in [16]; ignoring the Gauss-Bonnet contribution.\nIn order to carry on let us comment that we still have\nthe usual energy conservation,\u2207aS ab = 0 by virtue of\n\u2207a (Kab \u2212 \u03b3ab K) = 0, comig from the momentum constraint implicit in the five-dimensional Einstein equations. Further it is easy to see from \u03c3 and p that the\nenergy conservation equation is fulfilled:\nd(a3 \u03c3)\nda3\n+p\n= 0,\nd\u03c4\nd\u03c4\n\n(8)\n\nwhere the bracket h.i stands for the jump of a given quantity across the hypersurface \u03a3 and \u03b3ab is the induced metric on \u03a3. Notice that the first term in (8) is not enclosed\nwith the brackets because this contribution comes from\nthe four dimensional E-H term in the DGP action (1)\nwhich already lives in the boundary so it does not need\nto be projected on \u03a3. By taking the limit rc \u2192 0 we\nrecover the standard Darmois\u2013Israel junction condition\nfound in [13].\nNow, let us calculate some quantities that we shall need\nlater. The mixed components of the four-dimensional\nEinstein tensor are given by\n\u0010 \u02272\n1\u0011\nG 00 = \u22123 2 + 2 ,\na\na\n\u00101\n2\n\u0227\n\u00e4 \u0011\nG ij = \u2212 2 + 2 + 2 \u03b4 ij\na\na\na\n\n(11)\n\nwhere the prime inidcates the derivates with respect to\na. The most general form of the stress energy tensor on\nshell compatible with the simetries is\n\n\u00acS\nM\n\n2\u00e4 + f \u2032 (a)\n,\n= p\nf (a) + \u02272\n2p\nf (a) + \u02272 \u03b4 ij\n=\na\n\n(17)\n\nthe first term in Eq. (17) represents the internal energy\nchange of the shell and the second the work by internal forces of the shell. The dynamical evolution of the\nwormhole throat is governed by the generalized Lanczos\nequations and to close the system we must supply an\nequation of state p = p(\u03c3) that relates p and \u03c3. Notice\nthat the reason why one obtains exact conservation, i.e,\nno energy flow to the bulk, is that the normal-tangential\ncomponents of the stress tensor in the bulk is the same\non both side of the junction hypersurface.\nIV.\n\nMATTER SUPPORTING THE\nWORMHOLES\n\nRecently, classical solutions within the DGP model\nwere found when the stress-energy tensor on the brane\nsatisfies the dominant energy condtion, yet the brane has\n\n\f4\nnegative energy from the bulk point of view (see [28]).\nWithin this frame, the study of superluminal propagation indicates that superlumnosity occurs whenever the\nstress tensor on the shell is a pure cosmological constant,\nirrespective of the value of the shell density (cf.[28]). All\nthese elements are good reasons to consider a careful discussion about the nature of matter supporting wormholes in the DGP model. Moreover, motivated by the\nresults within Einstein-GaussBonnet gravity (i.e. with\nR2 -like terms) in [19], here we evaluate the amount of\nexotic matter and the energy conditions, following the\napproach presented above where the four-dimensional H\u2013\nE term generalizes the standard junction, adding a few\ngeometrical terms, which indeed represents the Einstein\ntensor projected on the shell. Consequently, coming the\nDGP contribution from the curvature tensor, the next\napproach is clearly the most suitable to give a precise\nmeaning to the characterization of matter supporting the\nwormhole.\nThe weak energy condition (WEC) states that for any\ntimelike vector U \u03be it must be T\u03be\u03b7 U \u03be U \u03b7 \u2265 0; the WEC\nalso implies, by continuity, the null energy condition\n(NEC), which means that for any null vector k \u03be it must\nbe T\u03be\u03b7 k \u03be k \u03b7 \u2265 0 [3]. In an orthonormal basis the WEC\nreads \u03c1 \u2265 0, \u03c1 + pl \u2265 0 \u2200 l while the NEC takes the form\n\u03c1+ pl \u2265 0 \u2200 l. Besides, the strong energy condition states\nthat \u03c1 + pl \u2265 0 \u2200 l, and \u03c1 + 3pl \u2265 0 \u2200 l.\nIn the case of thin-shell wormholes the radial pressure\npr is zero, within Einstein gravity, the surface energy\ndensity must fulfill \u03c3 < 0, so that both energy conditions\nwould be violated. The sign of \u03c3 + pt where pt is the\ntransverse pressure is not fixed, but it depends on the\nvalues of the parameters of the system. In what follows\nwe restrict to static configurations. The surface energy\ndensity \u03c30 and the transverse pressure p0 for a static\nconfiguration (a = a0 , \u0227 = 0, \u00e4 = 0) are given by\n\n\u03c30\n3rc\n12 p\nf (a0 ),\n= 2 \u2212\n8M53\na0\na0\nrc\n8p\np0\nf \u2032 (a0 )\np\n=\n\u2212\n+\n.\nf\n(a\n)\n+\n2\n0\n8M53\na20\na0\nf (a0 )\n\n(18)\n(19)\n\nNow the sign of the surface energy density as well as\nthe pressure is, in principle, not fixed. The most usual\nchoice for quantifying the amount of exotic matter in a\nLorentzian wormhole is the integral [9]:\n\u03a9=\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\n(\u03c1 + pr ) \u2212g5 d4 x.\n\n(20)\n\nWe can introduce a new radial coordinate R = \u00b1(r \u2212 a0 )\nwith \u00b1 corresponding to each side of the shell. Then,\nbecause in our construction the energy density is located\non the surface, we can also write \u03c1 = \u03b4(R) \u03c30 , and because the shell does not exert radial pressure the amount\n\nof exotic matter reads\n+\u221e\nZ2\u03c0Z\u03c0 Z\u03c0 Z\n\u221a\n\u03a9=\n\u03b4(R) \u03c30 \u2212g5 dR d\u03be d\u03b8 d\u03c6 = 2\u03c0 2 a30 \u03c30 .\n0\n\n0\n\n0 \u2212\u221e\n\n(21)\nReplacing the explicit form of \u03c30 and g5 , we obtain the\nexotic matter amount as a function of the parameters\nthat characterize the configurations:\n\u0011\n\u0010\np\n\u03a9 = 16M53 \u03c0 2 3rc a0 \u2212 12a20 f (a0 ) .\n(22)\n\nwhere f is given by the bulk solution. For rc \u2192 0 we\nobtain the exotic amount for Schwarzschild geometries\nas if it was calculated with the standard junction conditions. Far away from the General Relativity limit we\nnow find that there exist positive contributions to \u03c30 ;\nthese come from the different signs in the expression (22)\nfor the surface energy density, because is proportional\nto \u03c30 . We stress that this would not be possible if the\nstandard Darmois-Israel formalism was applied, treating\nthe DGP contribution as an effective energy-momentum\np\ntensor, because this leads to \u03c30 \u221d \u2212 f (a0 )/a0 . Now,\nonce the explicit form of the function f (a0 ) is introduced\nin Eq.(22), we focus on what are the conditions that lead\nto wormholes with \u03c30 > 0 or \u03a9 > 0. Then, it can be\nproved that wormholes with a non-negative surface density located at the shell are allowable when the following\ninequalities are simultaneously satisfy:\n\u03bc \u00111/2\n4\u0010\nrc\n1\n\u2212\n\u2212\na20\na0\na20\n\n> 0,\n\na20 \u2212 \u03bc > 0 ,\n\n(23)\n(24)\n\nso it is always possible to choose a0 such that the existence of thin-shell wormholes is compatible with positive\nsurface energy desnsity (see Fig2.), more precisely its radius must belong to the interval given below:\n\u221a\nr2 \u0001 1\n\u03bc < a0 \u2264 \u03bc + c 2\n16\n\n(25)\n\nNotice that rc -term is essential to have positive energy\ndensity; as one would expect, in the limit rc \u2212\u2192 0, this\npossibility completly vanishes. Besides, from Eq.(18) and\nEq.(19) we have that the sum of the pressure and energy\ndensity takes the form\n!\n2a0 f \u2032 (a0 ) \u2212 4f (a0 )\n2rc\n3\np\n+\n(26)\n\u03c30 + p0 = 8M5\na20\na0 f (a0 )\n\nbecause the first term in (26) is positive the sign of \u03c30 +p0\ndepends on the second \u221a\nterm, implying that the sum is\n\u221a\npositive for \u03bc < a0 \u2264 2\u03bc. Therefore, the remarkable\nresult is that we have a region with \u03c30 \u2265 0 and besides\n\u03c30 + p0 \u2265 0 , so the WEC and the NEC are satisfied (see\nFig.3 and Fig.4).

(14-15) nonlinear character of\nthese expressions make the standard procedure exposed\nin [32] very hard to implement. So, we are going to focus\nin a particular type of wormholes/shell. To be precise\nwe desire to eximane if it is possible to have dynamical\nsolitonic wormholes/shells characterized by a zero pressure (p = 0) and zero energy density (\u03c3 = 0). Unlike\nthe standard Darmois\u2013Israel junction condition, nontrivial solutions may be possible even when Sba = 0. That\nis, the extrinsic curvature can be discontinuos across the\nthroat with no matter on the shell to serve a source;\nturning the discontinuity a self-supported gravitational\nsystem. Of course, these configurations are impossible\nin the Einstein gravity but not in the Einstein-GaussBonnet gravity (cf. [18]).\nFor \u0227 6= 0 the Eq.(17) shows that if \u03c3 = 0 then p = 0;\nso we are going to work with the most useful expression\nwhich in this case is given by \u03c3. Following the procedure\nmentioned in [29] we shall plot trayectories in the phase\nspace spanned by (\u0227, a). Because of the energy constraint\n\n\f6\n(\u03c3 = 0) is invariant under the symmetry \u0227 \u2190\u2192 \u2212\u0227 we\ncan work on a two-dimensional plane which is defined as\na non-compact domain, namely B = (0, +\u221e)\u00d7(r+ , +\u221e).\nThe curves which represent the dynamics of solitonic\nwormholes are obtained by imposing the following conditions:\n\u0011 12\n\u0010\n\u0001\n= 0,\n(29)\nrc \u02272 + 1 \u2212 4 a2 \u2212 \u03bc + a2 \u02272\na2 \u2212 \u03bc > 0\n\n(30)\n\nsuch that the first inequality guarantees zero energy\nwhereas the second one ensures that the wormholes radius is larger than event horizon.

More precisely, the solitonic solution\ncould suffer an accelerated (\u00e4 > 0) or decelerated (\u00e4 < 0)\nexpansion (\u0227 > 0) as well as an accelerated or decelerated\ncontraction (\u0227 < 0) regimes.\nUnlike the Einstein\u2013Gauss-Bonnet case studied in [18]\nit turns that the existence of solitonic shells in DGP gravity does not require the presence of a cosmological constant term in the bulk spacetime.\n\n6\nrc =3.5\n\n\u039c=10\n\n5\n\nrc =7\nrc =10\n\nrc =5\n\na3\n\na3\n\n2\n\n2\nrc =30\n\n6\n\n8\na\n\n10\n\nrc =20\n\nrc =40\nrc =100\n\n1\n\n0\n4\n\n\u039c=100\n\n4\n\nrc =15\n\n1\n\nrc =10\n\n12\n\n0\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\na\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\nFIG. 5: We show the trayectories of vacuum shells in the fase\nplane for \u03bc \u2208 [0.01, 100] and different values of DGP scale rc .\n\nphase diagrams shows that for small or large \u03bc and with a\nDGP scale covering the interval [0.5, 50], the shell velocity is a monotone increasing function for \u0227 \u2208 (0, +\u221e) (or\ndecreasing one when \u0227 \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, 0)). Notice that the same\nconclusion is obtained when the parameter rc takes larger\nvalues. In order to see if these types of shells speed up\nor decelerate we use the zero pressure condition to get a\nfunctional relation \u00e4 = N [a, \u0227] which determines the sign\nof \u00e4:\np\n\u22128af (a) \u2212 8a\u02272 \u2212 2a2 f \u2032 (a) + rc (1 + \u02272 ) f (a) + \u02272\n\u0010\n\u0011\nN =\np\n2a 2a \u2212 rc f (a) + \u02272\n(31)\n\nThe generalization of Einstein gravity in the way proposed by Dvali, Gabadadze and Porrati (DGP) introduces a new parameter, which allows for more freedom\nin the framework of determining the most viable wormhole configurations. If wormholes could actually exist,\none would be interested in those which are require as little amount of exotic matter as possible. Of course, the\ncase could be that a given change of the theory leads to\na worse situation, i. e. that configurations require more\nmatter violating the energy conditions as the departure\nfrom the standard theory becomes relevant. However, for\nsuitable wormhole radius, this seems not to be the case\nwith DGP gravity : Here we have examined the \"exotic\"\nmatter content of thin-shell wormholes using the generalized junction condition, and we have found that for\nlarge values of the DGP parameter, corresponding to a\nsituation far away from the General Relativity limit, the\namount of exotic matter is reduced in relation with the\nstandard case beause it can be positive definite. Moreover, the remarkable result is that we have a region with\n\u03c30 \u2265 0 and besides \u03c30 + p0 \u2265 0 , so the WEC and the\nNEC are satisfied. Further the SEC condition holds also.\nThus if the requirement of exotic matter is considered\nas the hardest objection against wormholes, our results\nsuggest that in a physical scenario with small crossover\nscale (rc \u223c O(1)) or far away from the General Relativity\n2\nlimit where the DGP becomes dominant (rc >\n\u223c 10 ) these\ntypes of wormholes could be possible. Finally, we showed\nthe existence of gravitational solitonic wormholes/shell\ncharacterized by \u03c3 = p = 0 within the DGP model. Unlike the case of Einstein\u2013Gauss-Bonnet theory we found\nthat the existence of solitonic shells in DGP gravity does\nnot require the presence of a cosmological constant term\nin the bulk solution.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nMGR thanks the University of Buenos Aires for partial support under project X044.

Below this scale the predictions\nof the theory are in good agreement with the GR results\nand above it they deviate considerably(cf.[31])\n\n\f"}
