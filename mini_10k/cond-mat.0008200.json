In addition to calculating all of\nthe equilibrium structural parameters (Sec. II) we have\nalso obtained values for all of the zero-pressure elastic\nconstants (Sec. III) for both phases. We have investigated the electronic structure (Sec. IV) which is directly\nrelevant to the infrared detector applications of these materials. The purpose in all of these calculations has been\nto provide a fundamental understanding of the ground\nstate properties of the Pt silicides. We summarize our\nresults in Sec. V.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nMetallic Pt silicide compounds are used to make rectifying junctions on silicon substrates. The Schottky barrier, which determines the activation energy for transport of the charge carriers (holes), is 220\u2013240 meV for\northorhombic PtSi on p-type Si(001),1,2 matching an important atmospheric \"transparency window\" in the infrared region. For this reason these materials are well\nsuited to infrared detector applications. Orthorhombic\nIrSi has also been used in these applications and has a\nSchottky barrier of 160 meV on Si(001),3 matching a\nlower portion of the transparency window. An important advantage of the silicides is that they are more compatible with current silicon-based fabrication technology\nthan infrared sensitive semiconductors such as InSb and\nHgx Cd1\u2212x Te.\nDespite their importance in infrared detector applications, relatively little theoretical work has been done\nto investigate the fundamental electronic structure and\nequilibrium properties of the Pt silicides. Bisi et al.4 used\nthe iterative extended Huckel method to calculate the\nangular-momentum-resolved density of states (DOS) for\na number of near noble-metal silicides, including \u03b1-Pt2 Si\nand PtSi. Yarmoshenko et al.5 compared x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and x-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) measurements to the electronic structure calculated using a linear muffin-tin orbital (LMTO)\nmethod for a number of 4d and 5d silicides, including\nPtSi. In order to provide a more complete understand-\n\nII. ATOMIC STRUCTURE\nA. Crystal structures\n\nTable I summarizes the characteristics of the equilibrium crystal structures for each of the materials considered here. The pure Pt and Si constituents of the Pt silicides both crystallize in a cubic structure under normal\nconditions, face-centered cubic (fcc) for Pt6 and cubic\ndiamond for Si.7 Both cubic structures are characterized\nby a single lattice constant a (Table II).\nThe conventional unit cells of the two Pt silicides \u03b1Pt2 Si and PtSi are illustrated in Fig. 1. The structure of\nthe room-temperature (T < 968 K) \u03b1-phase of Pt2 Si is\nbody-centered tetragonal (bct) and resembles a distorted\n1\n\n\fCaF2 structure.8,9 A central Si atom is surrounded by\neight Pt atoms, which are located in the corners of a rectangular cell elongated along the c-axis. There are two\nsymmetry-equivalent Pt and one Si atom in the primitive cell. The unit cell is characterized by two lattice\nconstants a and c (Table II).\nPtSi has a primitive orthorhombic structure [see\nFig. 1(b)] with four symmetry-equivalent Pt and four\nsymmetry-equivalent Si atoms per primitive cell in an\nMnP-type lattice.10,11 This structure is characterized by\nthree lattice constants, denoted a, b, and c (Table II).\nHalf of the Pt and half of the Si atoms in the primitive\ncell are located in a (010) plane at 14 b with the rest of the\natoms in a (010) plane at 34 b. The in-plane atomic coordinates are not completely specified by the space group\nsymmetry and thus there are four free internal structural\nparameters uPt , vPt , uSi , and vSi (the \"1st position\" column in Table I). The experimental values are given in\nTable III. Each Si is surrounded by six Pt atoms at the\ncorners of a distorted trigonal prism. The Pt atoms have\nsix Si neighbors at the corners of a distorted octahedron,\nand four Pt neighbors, which are positioned in four of\nthe octahedral interstices.11 The Pt atoms are arranged\nin zig-zag chains along the [100] direction.\n\ngave 6912 (864) points in the full Brillouin zone (BZ) and\n182 (28) points in the irreducible wedge. In addition, a\nreal space mesh is used for calculating integrals of the potential over the interstitial region. We used a 16\u00d716\u00d716\nmesh for Pt and an 18\u00d718\u00d718 mesh for Si. With these\nchoices the total energies were converged to better than\n1 \u03bcRy per atom.\nIn order to determine the equilibrium lattice constants\nof the silicides, the total energy hypersurfaces were minimized simultaneously with respect to all of the lattice parameters. In the case of tetragonal \u03b1-Pt2 Si, total-energy\ncalculations were performed at nine different values of\neach of the two lattice constants a and c (a total of 81\ncalculations) in the range 0.93 \u2264 a/aexp, c/cexp \u2264 1.07.\nFor orthorhombic PtSi we used seven different values of\na, b, and c, respectively (343 calculations), within the\nsame relative ranges. For both \u03b1-Pt2 Si and PtSi, 216 kpoints were sampled in the full BZ which reduced to 28\nand 27 special k-points in the irreducible wedge, respectively. In the case of \u03b1-Pt2 Si a 16\u00d716\u00d716 real space mesh\nwas used for the interstitial integrals and a 24\u00d716\u00d724\nmesh was used for PtSi. With these choices the energy per atom differed from the fully converged value\n(which was found for approximately 13 000 k-points in\nthe full BZ) by 0.20 mRy for \u03b1-Pt2 Si and 0.19 mRy for\nPtSi. The resulting total energy hypersurfaces, E(a, c)\nand E(a, b, c), were each fit to a third order polynomial\nin the lattice parameters. These polynomials were then\nminimized to yield the equilibrium parameters. The bulk\nmodulus and equilibrium volume were obtained by fitting\nthe total energy as a function of volume to a four-term\nBirch-Murnaghan equation of state,19\n\nB. FPLMTO method\n\nThe equilibrium structural parameters and zeropressure elastic constants were calculated with a full potential linear muffin-tin orbital (FPLMTO) method12,13\nwhich makes no shape approximation for the crystal\npotential. For mathematical convenience the crystal\nis divided into regions inside atomic spheres, where\nSchr\u00f6dinger's equation is solved numerically, and an interstitial region. In our FPLMTO method the basis\nfunctions in the interstitial region are smoothed Hankel functions.14 This method does not require the use\nof empty spheres, even for open structures such as cubicdiamond-phase Si. The atoms were treated scalar relativistically within the local density approximation, using the exchange-correlation potential of Ceperley and\nAlder.15 Spin-orbit interactions were not included. The\nchoice of basis functions for the Pt and Si atoms was optimized according to the procedure described in Ref. 12.\nThe parameters describing the basis are listed in Table IV\nand were used in the calculations for both silicides in addition to pure Pt and pure Si.16 The Si 3s, 3p, 3d, and\n4f as well as the Pt 6s, 6p, 5d, and 5f were all included\nas valence orbitals. The Pt semi-core 5s and 5p were\ntreated as core orbitals and we have not used the frozen\noverlapped core approximation (FOCA-see Ref. 12).\nThe equilibrium volume V0 and bulk modulus B0 of Pt\nand Si were determined by fitting the total energy calculated at nine different lattice constants to a Murnaghan\nequation of state.17,18 In the case of Pt (Si) we used a\n24\u00d724\u00d724 (12\u00d712\u00d712) cubic special k-point mesh which\n\nE(V ) =\n\n4\nX\n\nan V \u22122n/3 .\n\n(1)\n\nn=1\n\nThis fit was differentiated\ntwice, yielding the bulk modh 2\ni\n\u2202 E(V )\nulus B0 = V\nat the theoretical equilibrium\n\u2202V 2\nV0\n\nvolume.\nThe four free internal structural parameters of orthorhombic PtSi, (uPt , vPt , uSi and vSi in Table I), were\ndetermined self-consistently by calculating the ab initio\nforces12,20 on the ions and, within the Born-Oppenheimer\napproximation,21 relaxing the position of each individual\natom in the direction of the forces until the absolute values of the forces were converged to less than 1.5 mRy/a.u.\n512 special k-points were used within the full BZ (corresponding to 64 in the irreducible wedge). Initially the\natomic positions were relaxed starting from the experimental structure11 and holding the three lattice constants\nfixed at their experimental values. Using these theoretically determined internal parameters, the theoretical\nequilibrium lattice constants, a0 , b0 , and c0 , as well as the\nbulk modulus B0 , were determined using the procedure\ndescribed above. A second geometry relaxation was then\ncarried out but now holding the lattice constants fixed at\nthese theoretically determined equilibrium values. This\n2\n\n\fyielded a second set of internal structural parameters\nwhich we refer to as the self-consistent theoretical values.\nIn principle this cycle could be repeated many times to\nobtain a set of lattice constants and internal parameters\nwhich are truly \"self-consistent.\"22 However, in practice\nwe find that after the first cycle there are only small differences between the two sets of internal parameters (see\nTable III) and so we regard them as being converged. We\nalso note that the value of B0 obtained using fixed values\nof the internal structural parameters, as described here,\nis not strictly correct and that we relax the constraint\nof fixed internal parameters when we discuss the elastic\nconstants (including B0 ) in Sec. III E.\n\nIII. ELASTIC CONSTANTS\nA. Method of calculation\n\nThe elastic constants determine the stiffness of a crystal against an externally applied strain. For small deformations we expect a quadratic dependence of the crystal\nenergy E on the strain (Hooke's law). The elastic constants cijkl describe this quadratic behavior. Consider\na displacement u(R) which takes every Bravais lattice\npoint R of the undistorted lattice to a new position R\u2032\nin the strained lattice,\nRi\u2032 = Ri + ui (R),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the index i corresponds to Cartesian coordinates.\nIf we assume the applied strain is homogeneous (uniform\nthroughout the crystal), we can rewrite Eq. 2 as\n\nC. Equilibrium properties\n\nRi\u2032 =\n\nIn order to test our method12 and, in particular, to\ntest our choice of basis functions, we calculated the equilibrium lattice constant a0 and bulk modulus B0 for Pt\nand Si as described in Sec. II B. The results are given in\nTable II and compared to experimental data. Since we\nwill focus next on the elastic constants, we pay particular\nattention to B0 , which is essentially an elastic constant.\nWe see in Table II that we obtain rather good agreement between our values and the experimental data. The\nself-consistent equilibrium lattice-constants a0 and c0 for\n\u03b1-Pt2 Si are also listed in Table II, along with the theoretical a0 , b0 , and c0 lattice constants for PtSi. The bulk\nmoduli B0 at the theoretical volumes for both Pt silicides\nare also given.\nIn Table III we list the internal structural parameters\nfor PtSi. The values calculated using the experimental\nlattice constants are very close to those measured by\nGraeber et al.11 Comparing the atomic positions using\nthe experimental versus the theoretical internal parameters, we find absolute shifts in the positions of less than\n0.028 a.u. The self-consistent internal parameters obtained using the theoretical lattice constants are generally even closer to the experimental values. In this case\nthe absolute atomic shifts relative to the experimental\ngeometry are less than 0.023 a.u.\nThe theoretical cohesive energies Ecoh and heats of formation \u2206Hf for the self-consistent equilibrium atomic\ngeometries are compared to the experimental values in\nTable V. As is typically the case, our local-densityfunctional based calculations overestimate the cohesive\nenergy. However, the calculated heats of formation are\nmuch closer to the experiment. The experimental heats\nof formation are given for T = 298.15 K whereas the\ntheoretical values correspond to 0 K and do not include\ncorrections for zero-point vibrations. We note that the\nheats of formation are very similar for the two silicides\nand that a plot of the theoretical \u2206Hf as a function of\natomic percent Pt is concave up, as required for the silicides to both be thermodynamically stable.\n\nX\n\n\u03b1ij Rj\n\nwith \u03b1ij = \u03b4ij +\n\nj\n\n\u2202ui (R)\n.\n\u2202Rj\n\n(3)\n\nFor a homogeneous applied strain the displacement gradients \u2202ui (R)/\u2202Rj are simply constants, independent of R.\nThese displacement gradients define the nine components\nof a tensor. However, since the total energy E cannot\nchange under rotations of the crystal as a whole, E can\nonly depend on the symmetric part of the deformation,23\ncalled the strain tensor \u01eb:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 \u2202ui (R) \u2202uj (R)\n.\n(4)\n+\n\u01ebij =\n2\n\u2202Rj\n\u2202Ri\nExpanding the internal energy E(V,\u01eb) of the crystal with\nrespect to the strain tensor gives24\nX\nE(V, {\u01ebmn }) = E(V ) + V\n\u03c3ij \u01ebij\nij\n\nV X\n+\ncijkl \u01ebij \u01ebkl + . . . ,\n2\n\n(5)\n\nijkl\n\nwhere the stress tensor \u03c3 is defined by\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 \u2202E(V, {\u01ebmn })\n,\n\u03c3ij =\nV\n\u2202\u01ebij\n\u01eb=0\n\n(6)\n\nthe second order adiabatic elastic constants are given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 \u2202 2 E(V, {\u01ebmn })\ncijkl =\n,\n(7)\nV\n\u2202\u01ebij \u2202\u01ebkl\n\u01eb=0\nand V is the volume of the unstrained crystal.

In order to minimize numerical uncertainties we\nused the same k-point mesh for all of the calculations in\na given material. The differing symmetries of the various strains I resulted in differing numbers of irreducible\nk-points. We also checked that we obtained the same\ntotal energy for \u03b3 = 0, regardless of strain I (and hence\ndifferent symmetry and irreducible k-points). All of the\ncalculations were carried out at the theoretical equilibrium lattice constants listed in Table II. Relaxation of\nthe internal degrees of freedom was carried out in the\ncase of all nine PtSi elastic constants. These relaxations\nare necessary because the atomic positions are not completely fixed by the space group symmetry, even for the\nunstrained crystal, and consequently there exist free internal parameters (see Table III) which must be redetermined for any distortion of the crystal, including hydrostatic pressure. Relaxations were also carried out in\nthose cases where the strain-induced symmetry-reduction\nprompted it (c44 for Si and strains 1, 4, 6 for \u03b1-Pt2 Si).\nFor comparison we have calculated \"frozen\" elastic constants in these same cases, where the internal structural\nparameters where frozen at their zero-strain equilibrium\nvalues.\n\n(9)\n\nIn order to calculate all M elastic constants of a crystal we applied M independent strains \u01eb(I) to the unit\ncell, using Eqs. (3) and (4) to determine the atom positions within the strained unit cell. In particular, we\nhave M = 3 for both cubic Si and cubic Pt, M = 6\nfor tetragonal Pt2 Si, and M = 9 for orthorhombic PtSi.\nEach strain I = 1, . . . , M was parameterized by a single variable \u03b3 and we calculated the total energy E (I) (\u03b3)\nfor a number of small values of \u03b3. For these small distortions, E (I) (\u03b3) was fit to a polynomial in \u03b3 and then\nequated to the appropriate elastic constant expression\n(I)\nE(V, {ei (\u03b3)}) in Eq. (8). From all of the fits we obtained a system of M linear equations for the elastic constants, which was solved for the cij . Since we always take\nthe undistorted crystal to be the zero-pressure theoretical equilibrium structure, the applied stress \u03c3 is zero and\nso the second term of Eqs. (5) and (8) does not enter in\nthe calculations described here.\nThe parameterizations we used for the three independent strains in the cubic cases of Pt and Si are given in\nTable VI. Strain I = 1 is a volume-conserving stretch\nalong the z-axis, the second strain is equivalent to simple hydrostatic pressure, and strain I = 3 corresponds to\na volume-conserving monoclinic shear about the z-axis.\nWe carried out calculations for 9 values of \u03b3 in the range\nof \u22120.01 to 0.01 for strains 1 and 2. However, for strain\n3 we calculated 9 points in the range from \u22120.04 to 0.04\nbecause the changes in the energy were rather small (a\nmaximum of 0.1 mRy for \u03b3 = 0.01), leading to larger error estimates in the case of the smaller range. In order to\ncalculate the six independent and non-vanishing elastic\nconstants of tetragonal \u03b1-Pt2 Si we used the strains given\nin Table VII.26 Orthorhombic PtSi has nine independent\nelastic constants and we chose the nine strains listed in\nTable VIII. For each of the silicide strains we carried out\ncalculations for seven values of \u03b3 in the range of \u22120.01 to\n0.01, except for strains 8 and 9 in the case of PtSi where\nonly five values of \u03b3 were considered (these monoclinic\nstrains were particularly CPU intensive). Calculational\nerrors in the elastic constants were determined from the\nleast-squares fit to E(\u03b3). All of our results were obtained\nfrom fits of the energy to third order in \u03b3 because these\nyielded the smallest errors compared to polynomials of\norder two and four; the single exception was Pt c44 , where\nminimum standard errors resulted from a fourth order fit.\nCalculations of the elastic constants require a very\nhigh degree of precision because the energy differences\ninvolved are of the order of 10 to 1000 \u03bcRy. This circumstance requires the use of a fine k-point mesh. With\nour choice of 23 328 special k-points in the full BZ for\nPt, 864 for Si, and 5832 for \u03b1-Pt2 Si and PtSi, the en-\n\nB. Pt\n\nThe three elastic constants for Pt are listed in Table IX. Pt is the only one of the metals considered in\nthis work for which experimental data on elasticity is\navailable. MacFarlane et al.28 extrapolated the values\nto 0 K, which makes them well suited for a comparison\nto our zero-temperature calculations. In the case of c11\nand c12 we find good agreement between our results and\nthe experimental data (within 3\u20134%). The value of c44\ndeviates by 14%, although the absolute error is approximately 10 GPa for all three elastic constants. The error\nin c44 can be understood if we look closely at the band\nstructure. Pt exhibits a wealth of van Hove singularities directly at the Fermi energy, making it difficult to\nintegrate over the Fermi surface. A high density of kpoints (23 328 in the full BZ) and a very small smearing\nwidth of 7 mRy in the higher-order smearing procedure29\nare essential because the Fermi energy and hence the total energy depend quite sensitively on these parameters.\nThe calculated value of c44 was found to be more sensitive to the k-points than the other two elastic constants.\nConversely, the silicides did not warrant such a special\ntreatment and were calculated with a smearing width of\n25 mRy. It seems plausible that a more accurate treatment of the elastic properties of Pt may also require inclusion of spin-orbit coupling. The bulk modulus calculated from the theoretical values of the elastic constants\n[B0 = 31 (c11 + 2c12 )] is 290.8 GPa. It agrees well with\nboth the experimental value of 288.4 GPa and the one\nextracted from the fit to a Murnaghan equation of state,\n4\n\n\fin such a way that the positions of the Pt atoms are no\nlonger completely fixed by the symmetry. The straininduced forces drive them into energetically more favorable positions. However, the Si atom occupies a center\nof inversion symmetry and thus Si internal displacements\nare forbidden in all cases (i.e. the strain-induced forces\nare identically zero). Symmetry also places specific restrictions on the nature of the Pt displacements. The\nsymmetry of strain 6, corresponding to c44 , allows Pt\ninternal displacements along both the [010] and [001] directions, while the inversion operation leads to the requirement that the displacements must be equal and opposite for the two Pt atoms in the primitive cell. The\nsymmetry of strain 4, corresponding to c11 , is the same\nas the symmetry of strain 1 and both allow internal displacements only along [001]. Once again the presence of\ninversion requires that the displacements of the two Pt\natoms be equal and opposite. Strain 5, corresponding\nto c33 , and strain 2 result in the same symmetry as the\nunstrained crystal and therefore there are no internal displacements associated with these cases, since there are no\ndegrees of freedom in the internal atomic coordinates of\nthe unstrained crystal. Strain 3 does lower the symmetry\nbut internal displacements are still symmetry-forbidden.\nThis fact, combined with the lack of displacements associated with strain 2 means that c66 is unaffected. We\nnote that since strains 1 and 4 result in the same symmetry reduction relative to the unstrained crystal there will\nnecessarily be a formal symmetry-required relationship\nbetween the internal displacements for these two strains.\nThis relationship is obtained directly from the first principles calculations.\nIn addition to placing restrictions on the nature of the\ninternal displacements, symmetry also constrains the corresponding changes in the elastic constants themselves.\nWe have already seen that the values of c11 and c44 are\nboth allowed to change as a result of internal displacements but that c33 and c66 must both remain unchanged.\nThe bulk modulus B0 is also required to be unchanged\nbecause it represents the crystal response to hydrostatic\npressure, corresponding to a strain \u01eb(B) = \u03b3\u03b4ij which\npreserves the full symmetry of the unstrained crystal,\njust as in the case of strains 2 and 5. The expression\nfor the bulk modulus in terms of the elastic constants is\nB0 = 91 (2c11 + c33 + 2c12 + 4c13 ) while the energy expression corresponding to strain 2 is (c11 +c12 \u22124c13 +2c33 )\u03b3 2\n(see Table VII). Our symmetry arguments have required\nthat neither of these expressions can change as a result of\ninternal displacements and therefore the changes in c11 ,\nc12 , and c13 must exactly cancel from these two expressions (we have already shown in conjunction with strain\n5 that c33 cannot change). The only way to achieve both\ncancellations is if the displacement-induced change in c13\nis identically zero and if the changes in c11 and c12 are\nequal and opposite. Moreover, since c11 appears as the\nsole coefficient in the energy expression corresponding to\n\n287.8 GPa (Sec. II C).\nThe requirement of mechanical stability in a cubic\ncrystal leads to the following restrictions on the elastic\nconstants24\n(c11 \u2212 c12 ) > 0,\n\nc11 > 0 c44 > 0,\n\n(c11 + 2c12 ) > 0.\n(10)\n\nThe Pt elastic constants in Table IX obey these stability\nconditions, including the fact that c12 must be smaller\nthan c11 . These conditions also lead to a restriction on\nthe magnitude of B0 . Since B0 is a weighted average of\nc11 and c12 and stability requires that c12 be smaller than\nc11 , we are left with the result that B0 is required to be\nintermediate in value between c11 and c12 ,\nc12 < B0 < c11 .\n\n(11)\n\nC. Si\n\nBecause Si has a cubic structure, it has only three distinct, non-vanishing elastic constants. These were determined with the same strains as in the case of Pt (Table VI). Our results are close to experiment, as indicated in Table IX. The bulk moduli from the total energy minimization and from the elastic constants\n[B0 = 31 (c11 + 2c12 )] have the same value of 95.9 GPa,\nclose to the one calculated from the experimental elastic\nconstants, 97.0 GPa. The Si elastic constants in Table IX\nalso obey the cubic stability conditions in Eq. (10), meaning that c12 < B0 < c11 .\nIt is perhaps worth noting that the calculation of c44\nrequired a relaxation of the positions of the Si atoms\nwithin the distorted unit cell. The symmetry reduction\nby the monoclinic shear (\u01eb(3) in Table VI) allowed the\nSi atoms to relax in the [001] direction. Without this\nrelaxation, c44 would have been 108.6 GPa; this is to\nbe compared with the relaxed value of 79.9 GPa and\nthe experimental value of 79.1 GPa.30 We have also obtained the dimensionless Kleinman internal displacement\nparameter \u03b6 which determines the magnitude of the internal displacements along the [001] direction,\na\n(I=3)\n(12)\n\u2206u3\n= \u03b6 \u01ebxy ,\n4\nwhere a is the lattice constant and \u01ebxy = 12 e6 is the appropriate element of the strain tensor [Eq. (9) and Table VI].\n(I=3)\nFitting our calculated values of \u2206u3\nto a quadratic\nfunction in \u03b3 we find a value of \u03b6 = 0.53 which agrees\nvery well with the experimental value of 0.54.31\nD. \u03b1-Pt2 Si\n\nWe have applied the six strains listed in Table VII in\norder to determine the elastic constants of tetragonal \u03b1Pt2 Si. The orthorhombic strains 1 and 4, and the monoclinic strain 6 all reduce the symmetry of the crystal\n5\n\n\fstrain 4 and since internal displacements can only lower\nthe energy, we conclude that the value of c11 must either\ndecrease or remain the same. This conclusion leads to\nthe seeming paradox that if c11 decreases then symmetry\nrequires that c12 must increase which appears to contradict the fact that internal displacements must always\nlower the energy. The resolution of this seeming paradox\ncomes from the fact that it is not possible to construct\na strain in which c12 appears as the sole coefficient in\nthe expression for the strain energy. It always appears\nin conjunction with c11 and we have already seen that\nc11 + c12 is required by symmetry to be unchanged while\nc11 \u2212 c12 can either decrease or remain unchanged.\nOur results for the six independent and non-zero elastic\nconstants of \u03b1-Pt2 Si are given in Table X. We have calculated the elastic constants for the \"frozen\" configuration\n[all atoms held at the positions determined solely from\nEq. (3)] and with the relaxation of the strain-induced\nforces on the Pt atoms. In keeping with our general symmetry arguments, we find a relaxation-induced softening\nof c11 by 4% and of c44 by 17%. In addition, c12 increases by 6% while the remaining elastic constants are\nunchanged to within numerical uncertainties. Our results are also consistent with the symmetry requirement\nthat the changes in c11 and c12 be equal and opposite,\nsince c11 decreases by 14.8\u00b11.5 GPa whereas c12 increases\nby 14.6\u00b11.6 GPa. The bulk moduli calculated from the\ntetragonal elastic constants and from the fit to a BirchMurnaghan equation of state are almost the same, giving\na consistent prediction of B0 = 235 GPa. As required by\nsymmetry, the bulk modulus has the same value in the\nfrozen and relaxed calculations.\nThe requirement that the crystal be stable against any\nhomogeneous elastic deformation places restrictions on\nthe elastic constants, just as in the cubic case. For tetragonal crystals these mechanical stability restrictions are as\nfollows24\n(c11 \u2212 c12 ) > 0, (c11 + c33 \u2212 2c13 ) > 0,\nc11 > 0, c33 > 0, c44 > 0, c66 > 0,\n(2c11 + c33 + 2c12 + 4c13 ) > 0.\n\nfor c11 and c33 we obtain\n\n(I)\n\n\u2206ui\n\n(13)\n\nUsing Eq. (14) and the first two inequalities in Eq. (13),\nwe obtain the following result\n1\n(2c11 + c33 ),\n3\n\n(I)\n\n= a\u03b6i \u03b3,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere a is the lattice constant, I = 1, 4, 6 corresponds\nto the strains with symmetry-allowed internal displacements, and i is the Cartesian index (i = 2, 3 for I = 6\nand i = 3 for I = 1, 4). In principle there could be con(I)\ntributions to the \u2206ui which are of higher order in \u03b3,\nbut since we are only considering the second order elastic constants the strain energy is only expanded to second\norder in \u03b3 [see Eqs. (5) and (8)], or equivalently, to second\norder in the total displacements, ui + \u2206ui . Thus we need\nonly consider the linear term in Eq. (17) in the present\n(I)\ncontext. The calculated values of the \u03b6i parameters are\nlisted in Table XI along with the displacement parameter associated with c44 in Si. We note that although\ndisplacements are allowed along both the [010] and [001]\ndirections in the case of the \u03b1-Pt2 Si strain 6 (corresponding to c44 ), the displacements along [001] are found to be\nzero to linear order in \u03b3.33 As indicated above, we expect\nthe internal displacements for strains 1 and 4 to exhibit a\nsymmetry-required relationship and in keeping with this\n(I=1)\nis almost exactly three\nexpectation we find that \u03b63\n(I=4)\ntimes larger than \u03b63\n, the difference likely being due\nto numerical uncertainty.\n\n1\n[6c11 + 3c33 \u2212 2(c11 \u2212 c12 ) \u2212 2(c11 + c33 \u2212 2c13 )] .\n9\n(14)\n\nB0 <\n\n(16)\n\nthat the bulk modulus must be larger than the weighted\naverage of c12 and c13 .\nThe stability restrictions do not tell us anything further about the relative magnitudes of the various elastic\nconstants. For example, we find a small value of c44 in\ncomparison to c66 which means that the tetragonal unit\ncell is more easily deformed by a pure shear about the aor b-axis in comparison to the c-axis. We also find that\noverall the elastic constants of \u03b1-Pt2 Si are much closer\nto those of pure Pt than pure Si. In particular c11 and\nc33 are similar in magnitude to c11 in Pt, but all of these\nconstants are approximately twice the value of c11 in Si.\nSimilarly c12 has approximately the same magnitude for\nboth \u03b1-Pt2 Si and Pt, although c13 in the silicide is about\n30% smaller. However, c12 in Si is a factor of four smaller.\nConversely, the value of c44 is similar in magnitude for\nall three materials, with c66 in the silicide being a factor\nof two larger. The bulk modulus in the silicide is about\n20% smaller than in Pt but still more than a factor of\ntwo larger than in Si. The connection between the magnitudes of the various elastic constants and the chemical\nbonding has been explored in detail in a separate study.32\nIn addition to the relaxed elastic constants we also ob(I)\ntained the values of the dimensionless parameters \u03b6i\nwhich determine the magnitudes of the Pt internal displacements themselves,\n\nThe elastic constants in Table X satisfy all of the conditions in Eq. (13). In particular, c12 is smaller than\nc11 and c13 is smaller than the average of c11 and c33 .\nThe stability conditions again lead to restrictions on the\nmagnitude of B0 . We first rewrite B0 as\nB0 =\n\n1\n(c12 + 2c13 ),\n3\n\nB0 >\n\n(15)\n\nthat the bulk modulus must be smaller than the weighted\naverage of c11 and c33 . Similarly, by substituting instead\n6\n\n\ffollows24\n\nE. PtSi\n\n(c11 + c22 \u2212 2c12 ) > 0,\n\n(c11 + c33 \u2212 2c13 ) > 0,\n(c22 + c33 \u2212 2c23 ) > 0,\nc11 > 0, c22 > 0, c33 > 0,\nc44 > 0, c55 > 0, c66 > 0,\n(c11 + c22 + c33 + 2c12 + 2c13 + 2c23 ) > 0.\n\nNine independent strains are necessary to compute\nthe elastic constants of orthorhombic PtSi. We first\nperformed calculations of the elastic constants with\nthe internal structural parameters uPt/Si and vPt/Si\nheld \"frozen\" at their self-consistent equilibrium values.\nThese results are listed in the second column of Table XII.\nThe E(\u03b3) curves are well-fitted by third-order polynomials in \u03b3, as can be seen from the small standard errors\nin the calculated cij . The value of B0 obtained from the\nelastic constants, B0 = 91 (c11 + c22 + c33 + 2c12 + 2c13 +\n2c23 ), agrees reasonably well with the one which was determined from the calculation of the lattice constants.\nThis is not surprising since the lattice constant calculations were also performed with frozen atomic degrees of\nfreedom.\nAs expected, the equilibrium atomic positions are not\nindependent of the shape and size of the unit cell-\nsimilarly to the case of c44 in Si as well as c11 , c12 , and\nc44 in \u03b1-Pt2 Si, as discussed above. The relaxed elastic constants for PtSi are listed in the last column of\nTable XII. For example, c44 drops from 141.3 GPa to\n100.1 GPa when all of the atoms are relaxed. We find\nthat the Si atoms adjust to this shear about the a-axis\nby moving mainly along the b-axis. Most of the other\nelastic constants decrease by 10\u201320%, except c23 which\nincreases by 8% and c12 which remains approximately\nunchanged. In analogy with the case of c12 for tetragonal \u03b1-Pt2 Si, we note that for an arbitrary strain c12 , c13 ,\nand c23 in orthorhombic PtSi never appear isolated but\nalways occur in combination with other elastic constants\nin the expression for the second-order change in the total\nenergy [Eq. (8)]. These particular elastic constants are\ntherefore not required to decrease when relaxation is included, even when the energy is lowered. Conversely, the\nremaining six elastic constants are required to decrease\nwhen relaxation lowers the energy because strains can\nbe constructed for which each appears as the isolated\ncoefficient of the only contribution to the second-order\nchange in the energy. In the case of PtSi, the additional\nrelaxation of the internal degrees of freedom leads to a\nsignificant softening of the elastic constants which must\nalso be taken into account in determining the bulk modulus. Therefore, we predict the bulk modulus of PtSi to\nbe 198 GPa, which is 6% lower than the value of 210 GPa\ndetermined in our frozen-configuration total-energy minimization. Although we have calculated the changes in\nthe elastic constants when the internal atomic degrees of\nfreedom are allowed to relax, we have not explicitly extracted the corresponding internal displacement parameters as we did for pure Si and \u03b1-Pt2 Si.\nMechanical stability leads to restrictions on the elastic constants, which for orthorhombic crystals are as\n\n(18)\n\nThe elastic constants in Table XII satisfy all of these conditions and in particular, c12 is smaller than the average\nof c11 and c22 , c13 is smaller than the average of c11 and\nc33 , and c23 is smaller than the average of c22 and c33 .\nAs in the case of \u03b1-Pt2 Si, we can obtain restrictions on\nthe magnitude of B0 ,\n1\n1\n(c12 + c13 + c23 ) < B0 < (c11 + c22 + c33 ),\n3\n3\n\n(19)\n\nthat the bulk modulus must be smaller than the average\nof c11 , c22 , and c33 but larger than the average of c12 ,\nc13 , and c23 .\nWe again find that overall the elastic constants of PtSi\nare much closer to those of pure Pt and \u03b1-Pt2 Si as compared to pure Si. In detail, we find that c11 , c22 , and c33\nare approximately 10% smaller on average in PtSi than\nin \u03b1-Pt2 Si, and that B0 is 16% smaller. In addition, c12 ,\nc13 , and c23 for PtSi are close in magnitude to c13 for\n\u03b1-Pt2 Si, which we saw was about 30% smaller than c12\nin both pure Pt and \u03b1-Pt2 Si. Finally, c44 , c55 , and c66\nfor PtSi are similar to the values of c44 in all three of the\nother materials, but still approximately a factor of two\nsmaller than c66 in \u03b1-Pt2 Si.\nF. Trends in the elastic constants\n\nThe trends of the elastic constants as a function of\nthe atomic percent Pt in all four materials are plotted\nin Fig. 2. Each of the curves corresponds to an average\nof a different class of elastic constants, while the symbols show the values of the individual elastic constants\nthemselves. As we saw in Eqs. (15), (16), and (19), mechanical stability requires that B0 be larger than the average of c11 , c22 , and c33 but smaller than the average\nof c12 , c13 , and c23 (note that in the case of \u03b1-Pt2 Si the\nappropriate averages are 13 (2c11 + c33 ) and 31 (c12 + 2c13 )\nbecause c11 = c22 and c13 = c23 for tetragonal crystals).\nThis stability requirement is reflected in the top three\ncurves in Fig. 2. We also see that these three curves\neach increase monotonically from Si to Pt and we note\nthat all three classes of elastic constants represented by\nthese curves correspond to strains in which the volume\nis not fixed. Conversely, the two lower curves labeled\n(c11 \u2212 c12 )/2 and c44 correspond to the two classes of\nelastic constants in which the strains are strictly volumeconserving [in the case of PtSi the lowest solid-line curve\nand large open circles correspond to elastic constant combinations 14 (c11 + c22 \u2212 2c12 ), 41 (c11 + c33 \u2212 2c13 ), and\n7\n\n\f1\n4 (c22\n\nIn a typical good metal such as Pt, the optical absorption at low energies is dominated by the free-electronlike Drude contribution. However, we saw from Fig. 3\nthat in the case of the silicides they have a low DOS at\nthe Fermi level and consequently are poor metals. In\nthis circumstance the Drude contribution will be greatly\nreduced and therefore the presence of many low-energy\nsplittings in the bands near the Fermi level may result\nin an inter-band contribution to the optical absorption\nwhich is significant even at low energies in the infrared\nrange.\n\n+ c33 \u2212 2c23 )]. We see that in this case the two\nsets of averages are approximately constant as a function\nof atomic percent Pt. The significance of this difference\nin the trends of volume-conserving versus non-volumeconserving elastic constants is connected to the nature\nof the chemical bonding in these materials and has been\naddressed in a separate study.32\n\nIV. ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE\n\nThe self-consistent calculations for the spin-orbit-split\nenergy bands of \u03b1-Pt2 Si and PtSi were performed using\nthe wien97 implementation34 of the linear augmented\nplane wave (LAPW) method.35,36 The local density approximation was used with the exchange-correlation potential of Perdew and Wang.37 The effects of the spinorbit interaction were included in a second-order variational procedure.36,38 In the self-consistency cycles approximately 120 irreducible k-points (1000 k-points in\nthe full BZ) were used in the modified tetrahedron\nmethod of Bl\u00f6chl.39 The energy cutoff used for the planewave expansion was kmax = 4.16 a.u. resulting in a well\nconverged basis set of about 105 basis functions per atom.\nThe experimental values of the lattice constants and internal structural parameters from Tables II and III were\nused in all cases. For the purpose of calculating the\ndensity of states (DOS) we again used the tetrahedron\nmethod but with unshifted k-point meshes which included the \u0393 point. In the case of fcc Pt, cubic-diamondphase Si, and \u03b1-Pt2 Si we used a 32\u00d732\u00d732 mesh corresponding to 897 irreducible k-points for the two cubic\nmaterials and 2393 for the silicide. For PtSi we used\na 16\u00d724\u00d716 mesh, yielding 1053 irreducible k-points\npoints.\nThe total DOS for all four materials is shown on the\nsame scale in Fig. 3. Although both silicides are metals\nwith a non-zero DOS at the Fermi level, they are found\nto be poor metals since the DOS is much smaller than\nin the case of pure Pt which is a good metal. In pure\nPt the Fermi level lies near the top but still within the\nlarge DOS features of the d\u2212band but in both silicides\nthe Fermi level lies above these large peaks. In addition, both silicides exhibit a peak in the DOS at around\n\u221210 eV which arises from the Si s-orbitals. We note that\nthe basic features of the electronic structure, as reflected\nin the total DOS, do not appear to differ very much between the two silicides. The origin of the various features\nin the PtSi DOS has been discussed in detail by Franco\net al.40\nWe have also calculated the spin-orbit-split energy\nbands near the Fermi level for the two silicides, as shown\nin Fig. 4. In both cases we see that there are a sizeable number of small-energy splittings between different\nbands throughout the full BZ. These small splittings are\nof direct interest with regard to low-energy inter-band\ntransitions which contribute to the optical absorption.\n\nV. SUMMARY\n\nWe have carried out an extensive first principles study\nof two room-temperature stable Pt silicides, tetragonal\n\u03b1-Pt2 Si and orthorhombic PtSi. We have determined\nthe theoretical equilibrium structural parameters and cohesive energies for both silicides, as well as pure fcc Pt\nand pure cubic-diamond-phase Si. In particular, we have\ncarried out a large number of calculations in order to\nminimize the total energy with respect to the two lattice constants in tetragonal \u03b1-Pt2 Si and the three lattice\nconstants and four internal structural parameters of orthorhombic PtSi. Our calculated structural parameters\nfor all four materials are in good agreement with experimental data, validating the method we have used.\nA major portion of our effort here has been directed\nat the elastic constants in the two silicides. All of the\nindependent, non-zero elastic constants (6 for \u03b1-Pt2 Si,\n9 for PtSi, and 3 each for the two cubic materials) have\nbeen calculated from first principles. The silicide calculations required extensive relaxation of the internal degrees\nof freedom, especially in the case of the low symmetry\nstructure of orthorhombic PtSi. Comparing the elastic\nconstants obtained with and without relaxation we find\nthat relaxation induces significant changes in the magnitudes of many of the elastic constants. In addition,\nwe have explicitly determined the dimensionless internal\ndisplacement parameters for the three strains in \u03b1-Pt2 Si\nfor which they are non-zero. We also note that the value\nof c44 in pure fcc Pt was found to be extremely sensitive\nto the number of k-points, much more so than any of the\nother elastic constants we calculated. This sensitivity\nresults from the large number of van Hove singularities\nclose to the Fermi level.\nWe have investigated the trends in the calculated elastic constants, both the trends within a given material\nas well as between materials. The requirement of mechanical stability places specific restrictions on the relative magnitudes of some of the elastic constants within a\ngiven material, including, for example, a restriction on\nthe bulk modulus that B0 < 31 (c11 + c22 + c33 ) and\nB0 > 31 (c12 + c13 + c23 ). With regard to the trends\namong the four materials, we find that in the metals the\nelastic constant expressions which correspond to volume8\n\n\fconserving strains are always smaller than those which\ncorrespond to strains which do not conserve volume. This\nalso turns out to be true in Si with the exception of\nc12 which is less than c44 . However, the difference in\nmagnitudes between volume-conserving and non-volumeconserving elastic constants is largest on average in Pt\nand gets smaller in the progression Pt \u2192 \u03b1-Pt2 Si \u2192 PtSi\n\u2192 Si. In general, the volume-conserving elastic constants\nhave similar magnitudes in all four materials while the\nnon-volume-conserving elastic constants follow this same\nprogression. In particular, the bulk modulus is found to\nbe a very nearly linear function of the atomic percentage\nof Pt. Klepeis et al.32 have studied the close connection\nbetween the various trends in the elastic constants and\nthe chemical bonding in the Pt silicides.\nThe calculated electronic structure demonstrates that\nthe two silicides are poor metals with a low density of\nstates at the Fermi level, and consequently we expect that\nthe Drude component of the optical absorption should be\nmuch smaller than in good metals such as pure Pt. In\naddition, we find a large number of small-energy differences between various bands near the Fermi level in the\ncalculated spin-orbit-split band structure for the two silicides. These two circumstances suggest that it may be\nimportant to include the interband contribution to the\noptical absorption as well, even in the infrared region.\n\nof Monographs on Metal Physics and Physical Metallurgy,\nedited by G.

Elastic constants of Pt and Si. Calculations were carried out at the theoretical self-consistent lattice constants\nof aPt = 7.403 a.u. and aSi = 10.22 a.u. The theoretical value of c44 in parentheses for Si is the \"frozen\" value obtained\nwithout allowing for internal relaxation. The bulk modulus is calculated from the elastic constants as B0 = 31 (c11 + 2c12 ). In\nparentheses we give B0 from the fit to a Murnaghan equation of state. Experimental values are extrapolated to 0 K.

Elastic constants of \u03b1-Pt2 Si. Calculations were performed at the theoretical self-consistent lattice constants\n(Table II). \"Frozen\" refers to fixed atomic positions, whereas \"relaxed\" indicates that a relaxation of the atomic positions\nwas carried out. Parentheses denote values where no internal relaxation was necessary because of symmetry constraints (small\nvariations in these values come from using a slightly more stringent convergence criterion on the energy). The bulk modulus is\ncalculated from the elastic constants as B0 = 91 (2c11 +c33 +2c12 +4c13 ). B0Birch is from a Birch-Murnaghan fit. No experimental\ndata is available.

In the case of strain 6 for \u03b1-Pt2 Si displacements were calculated along both the [010] and\n[001] directions, whereas displacements only along the [001] direction are allowed by symmetry for strains 1 and 4. In addition,\nthere is a strict symmetry-required relationship between the displacements in strains 1 and 4 (see text).
