The most popular topics are those\nconcerning the quasiclassical asymptotics of quantum mechanics, the asymptotic expansions when ~ \u2192 0 like the WKB approximation, oscillatory integrals and the method of stationary phase. There are also studies in the opposite direction, when, basing on the optical-mechanical analogy, the eikonal and\nHamilton-Jacobi equations, one investigates purely classical structures having\nsome striking analogies to quantum ones. And then one shows that really the\nmentioned classical structures, although a priori obvious on the purely classical\nlevel, may be also re-obtained from the quasiclassical limit transition ~ \u2192 0\nfrom quantum mechanics. Concerning such topics cf. for instance [27] and first\nof all references therein. Other very interesting studies of this kind, based on\nthe hydrodynamical picture of quantum mechanics, were presented by V. V.\nKozlov [19]. The author analyzed there vortices of the \"quantum fluid\" and\n\n2\n\n\fthat study is a part of his very interesting theory and methodology of vortices\nas a fundamental concept of dynamics. The ideas developed by this author go\nback to some very old and fundamental concepts in physics and philosophy of\nscience.\nAnother very important branch of investigations was the comparative study\nof the classical and quantum dynamics, including the dynamics of open systems\n[13, 14, 15]. Quantum measurement and decoherence problems in a sense belong\nto this topic [1, 2, 3, 4]. Certain ideas of nonlinearity in quantum mechanics\nappeared in connection to those problems (see, e.g., [9, 10, 12, 36, 37] and\nreferences therein).\nOur study, also as a matter of fact motivated by the aforementioned problems, is formally quite a different approach to the quantum-classical convolution\nof concepts. Namely, we \"forget\" what the Schr\u00f6dinger equation physically is.\nFor a moment, it is for us only a differential equation. To simplify the problem\nas far as possible, we consider a \"finite-level system\", when the \"configuration\nspace\" is a finite set and the corresponding linear space of \"wave functions\" is\nfinite-dimensional. All concepts we are here dealing with will remain essentially\nvalid also in the infinite-dimensional case (\"true\" wave functions); obviously\nsome care must be taken nevertheless when passing from a finite dimension to\nthe infinite one.\nThen we discuss the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms for such a\n\"classical\" mechanical system in Cn . In particular, the Dirac theory of primary\nand secondary constraints for systems with degenerate Lagrangians is discussed.\nThis approach enables one to formulate some models of nonlinearity. We hope\nthis nonlinearity may be perhaps a tool for describing measurement paradoxes\nand decoherence. The main point is that our formalism seems to suggest in a\nnatural way some geometrically well-justified nonlinearities, not ones introduced\n\"by hand\" as perturbations of some linear background. The main idea is that of\ndynamical \"scalar product\" which is not fixed once for all but itself is a dynamical quantity on equal footing with the \"wave functions\"; they both satisfy a\nclosed system of essentially, non-perturbatively nonlinear differential equations.\nThe structure of this nonlinearity is based and, one can say, almost canonically\nimplied by the geometric structure of \"classical\" degrees of freedom. Because\nof this we hope that the resulting effectively nonlinear quantum mechanics may\nbe perhaps free of paradoxes of decoherence and measurement and can provide\nsome new description of open quantum systems, alternative to that described\nin [1, 2, 3, 4].\nSome ideas of our \"classical\" description of quantum systems in terms of\nphase spaces and Hamiltonian dynamics are similar to those suggested many\nyears ago by D. Chru\u015bci\u0144ski [8].\n\n3\n\n\f1\n\nFinite-level nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation in\nthe Lagrange-Hamilton description\n\nFollowing the jargon used by laser specialists and those working with the quantum dynamics of mutually interacting spins, we use the term \"finite-level quantum system\" for such a one the \"Hilbert space\" of which is finite-dimensional, so\nit may be identified with Cn , when some basis is fixed. However, we shall avoid\nthe misuse of this identification, because it usually smuggles into the treatment\nsome artificial objects obscuring and often just falsifying the proper geometric\ninterpretation of the used concept and making impossible the introduction of\nnew ideas.\nAnd one thing must be explicitly stressed. We are in fact motivated by\ncertain problems from the realm of foundations of quanta. However, for some\nreasons at this stage of our treatment it was convenient to pretend to \"forget\"\nabout this motivation and just to consider Schr\u00f6dinger equation in a finitedimensional space purely classically, simply as an equation of mathematical\nphysics, in a sense classical mechanics, derivable from the variational principle\nand because of this treatable in terms of Lagrange-Hamilton formalism. And it\nis really interesting even from the point of view of this \"hypocritically\" classical language. For instance, it provides an interesting example of \"mechanics\"\nwith singular Lagrangians, effectively treatable within the framework of Dirac\nformalism involving the primary and secondary constraints in a phase space of\nthe problem.\nLater on we shall try to discuss the \"Schr\u00f6dinger\" equation involving secondorder time derivatives, and also introduce some kind of non-direct and geometrically-motivated nonlinearity based on making the scalar product a dynamical quantity. There are some reasons to expect this might be a new way\nof describing open quantum systems and a new promising attempt towards explaining quantum \"paradoxes\", decoherence and measurement. And using the\nmethods developed for n-level quantum systems, we formulate finally some ideas\nconcerning the treatment in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space and certain\nlinks with relativistic field equations.\n\n1.1\n\nSome complex geometry in linear spaces\n\nIn this section our primary concept is an n(< \u221e)-dimensional linear space W\nover the complex field C. It is well known that such a space gives rise to the\nnatural quadruple of mutually related n-dimensional complex linear spaces:\nW,\n\nW \u2217,\n\nW,\n\n\u2217\n\nW \u2243 W \u2217,\n\n(1)\n\nnamely, W itself, its usual dual W \u2217 over C, i.e., the space of C-linear C-valued\n\u2217\nfunctions on W , and their complex-conjugate spaces W and W \u2243 W \u2217 . There\nare many mistakes and misunderstandings concerning the complex conjugate\n\u2217\nspace W and the antidual one W \u2243 W \u2217 , which may be easily avoided at\nleast if W is finite-dimensional, that is the case at the present stage. Hence,\n4\n\n\f\u2217\n\nW \u2243 W \u2217 consists by definition of antilinear (semi-linear) functions on W , i.e.,\nsuch ones which satisfy\ng(aw + bv) = ag(w) + bg(v)\n\n(2)\n\nfor arbitrary w, v \u2208 W , a, b \u2208 C. So, there is a natural antilinear isomorphism\nof W \u2217 onto W \u2217 given by\nW \u2217 \u220b f 7\u2192 f \u2208 W \u2217 ,\n\nf (w) := f (w)\n\n(3)\n\nfor any w \u2208 W , f \u2208 W \u2217 ; the complex conjugate is taken pointwisely. As\nmentioned, (3) is an antilinear isomorphism acting between two linear spaces,\n(af + bg) = af + bg\n\n(4)\n\nfor any f, g \u2208 W \u2217 , a, b \u2208 C. For obvious reasons the inverse of (3) will be\ndenoted by the same symbol and the following holds:\nf = f.\n\n(5)\n\nBy analogy to the obvious canonical isomorphism between W and W \u2217\u2217 ,\nthe complex-conjugate space W is defined as the antidual of W \u2217 . Namely, its\nelements u \u2208 W are by definition antilinear functions on W \u2217 . So, for any\nf \u2208 W \u2217 , u(f ) is defined as\nu(f ) := f (u) = f (u).\n\n(6)\n\nCompare this with the standard identification of w \u2208 W with the linear function\non W \u2217 :\nw(f ) = f (w).\n(7)\nAgain there exists a canonical antilinear isomorphism of W onto W :\nW \u220b w 7\u2192 w \u2208 W ,\n\nw(f ) = w(f ).\n\n(8)\n\nAll this may be also done in other, equivalent way. The important things are\nthe following ones. All linear spaces (1) are logically different and the complex\nconjugates of vectors belong to other linear spaces, for example, w \u2208 W is not\nan element of W , unless some additional geometric structures are fixed in W .\nThere exists canonical linear isomorphism between W and W \u2217\u2217 (and similarly\nbetween W and W \u2217\u2217 ). There exists also canonical antilinear isomorphism of W\nand W (and similarly between W \u2217 and W \u2217 ). But of course without additional\ngeometric object in W (some metric) there is neither any canonical isomorphism\nbetween W and W \u2217 nor any one between W and W \u2217 .\nIf (e1 , . . . , en ) and (e1 , . . . , en ) are mutually dual bases in W and W \u2217 ,\nea (eb ) = \u03b4 a b ,\n\n(9)\n\nthen by the complex conjugation one obtains from them canonically the mutu\u2217\nally dual bases (e1\u0304 , . . . , en ), (e1\u0304 , . . . , en ) respectively in W and W \u2243 W \u2217 ,\nea (eb ) = \u03b4 a b .\n5\n\n(10)\n\n\fIf we expand vectors and covectors in W with respect to the first system of dual\nbases,\nw = w a ea ,\nf = fa ea ,\nf (w) = fa wa ,\n(11)\nthen, obviously,\nw = w a ea ,\n\nf = f a ea .\n\n(12)\n\nIn this special system of bases the complex conjugation of objects is analytically\nrepresented by the complex conjugate of the coefficients, as seen from the above\nformulae. But certainly w, w, f , f are elements of pairwise different linear\nspaces. So, the above formulae introduce the system of notations which will be\nconsequently used below.\nLet us stress that the definition of W \u2217 given above is valid in any linear space\nindependently of its dimension being finite or not. Unlike this the definition of\nW quoted above works only in the algebraically reflexive linear ones, but no\nother ones present interest for us.\nFurther on, the whole system of tensor products of W , W \u2217 , W , W \u2217 may be\nintroduced. Obviously, in applications we are interested in, the most important\nare linear mappings of W into itself, i.e., elements of\nL(W ) \u2243 W \u2297 W \u2217\n\n(13)\n\nand sesquilinear forms, i.e., elements of W \u2217 \u2297 W \u2217 . The corresponding analytical\nmatrix representation is given respectively by La b , Fab for L \u2208 L(W ), F \u2208\nW \u2217 \u2297 W \u2217 , etc. For sesquilinear forms we use the convention that they are\nantilinear in the first argument and linear in the second one:\nF (u, v) = Fab ua v b ,\n\n(14)\n\nso that\nF (au+bw, v) = aF (u, v)+bF (w, v),\n\nF (v, au+bw) = aF (v, u)+bF (v, w) (15)\n\nfor any values of vectors and coefficients. We usually need Hermitian forms, i.e.,\nsuch ones that\nF (u, v) = F (v, u),\nFab = F ba .\n(16)\nThen, obviously,\nF (u, u) = F (u, u),\n\nu 7\u2192 F (u, u) \u2208 R.\n\n(17)\n\nIf F is non-degenerate,\ndet [Fab ] 6= 0,\n\n(18)\n\nW \u220b v 7\u2192 F (*, v) \u2208 W \u2217\n\n(19)\n\ni.e., if\nW \u2217,\n\nthen there exists the inverse twice\nis a linear isomorphism of W onto\ncontravariant sesquilinear object F \u22121 \u2208 W \u2297W with components denoted briefly\nby F ab such that\nFac F cb = \u03b4a b .\n(20)\nF ac Fcb = \u03b4 a b ,\n6\n\n\fObviously, \u03b4 a b , \u03b4a b are here matrices of identity transformations respectively in\nW and W \u2217 .\nIf F is Hermitian and for any u \u2208 W we have\nF (u, u) > 0\n\nif\n\nu 6= 0,\n\n(21)\n\nthen we say that F is positively definite. Then there exist such bases in W that\nthe matrix of F is diagonal with (+1)-entries on the diagonal,\n[Fab ] = In .\n\n(22)\n\nOtherwise F has some signature (the number of positive and negative elements\non the diagonal) which is an invariant of F .\nLet us now assume that some non-degenerate Hermitian form \u0393 \u2208 W \u2217 \u2297 W \u2217\nis fixed once for all in W , so we are dealing with the algebraic structure (W, \u0393). If\n\u0393 is positively definite, (W, \u0393) is a finite-dimensional Hilbert space or, using more\ncustomary terms, a unitary space. If the positive definiteness is not assumed,\nwe are dealing with a pseudounitary space. The form \u0393 will play a role of\nthe scalar product if we insist on the quantum-mechanical interpretation. So,\nit seems natural to expect it should be positively definite. However, in many\nformal problems this assumption is not necessary. Moreover, even within the\nframework of quantum-mechanical interpretation, one cannot exclude a priori\nmodels with non-definite scalar products, at least at some stage of considerations\n(remind the old quantization of electrodynamics according to the Gupta-Bleuler\nprescription).\n\n1.2\n\nLagrangian and Hamiltonian models of the usual and\ngeneralized Schr\u00f6dinger equations (evolution)\n\nLet us return to our \"classical hypocrisy\". We discuss some models of \"analytical\nmechanics\" in the \"configuration space\" W . The system has 2n degrees of\nfreedom because the dimension of W as a linear space over reals equals 2n.\nHowever, often it is convenient to say that we are dealing with n \"complex\ndegrees of freedom\". If some basis (e1 , . . . , en ) is fixed in W , then expanding\nthe elements \u03c8 \u2208 W ,\n\u03c8 = \u03c8 a ea ,\n(23)\nwe introduce \"complex generalized coordinates\" \u03c8 a . Their real and imaginary\nparts form a system of 2n usual real coordinates. It is more convenient to use\nanother normalisation, namely,\n1\na\n\u03c8 = \u221a (xa \u2212 iy a ) ,\n2\n\n1\n\u03c8 a = \u221a (xa + iy a ) ,\n2\n\n(24)\n\nwhere xa , y a \u2208 R. Obviously, without any additional structure in W , the real\nand imaginary parts of the vector \u03c8 \u2208 W are not well defined. Taking the real\nand imaginary parts of \u03c8 a is an explicitly base-dependent procedure. Just like\n\n7\n\n\fin certain well-known formulae of classical field theory it is often formally convea\nnient to use the system of 2n complex variable \u03c8 a , \u03c8 as \"coordinates\". Many\nexpressions and calculations look then simpler. Then 2n complex quantities \u03c8 a ,\na\n\u03c8 are (on some intermediate stages) treated as if they were formally independent and only in the final formulae one \"remembers\" that they are interrelated.\nAnd expressions (24) describe then something like an orthogonal transformation of the\u0010 system\u0011 of 2n real variables (xa , y a ) into the system of 2n complex\n\nvariables \u03c8 a , \u03c8\n\na\n\n. More precisely, in a sense we work in the complex space\n\nW \u00d7 W of the complex dimension 2n. And later on the formulae are restricted\nto the \"diagonal\" of complex dimension n (real dimension 2n) consisting\nnot of\n\u0001\nall pairs (\u03c8, \u03c6) \u2208 W \u00d7 W but only of the pairs of the form \u03c8, \u03c8 \u2208 W \u00d7 W . If\nthere is some need of using symbols, we shall denote this \"diagonal\" as\n\u0001\n\b\n\u0001\nDiag W \u00d7 W := \u03c8, \u03c8 : \u03c8 \u2208 W .\n(25)\n\nIn variational problems one deals with real-valued Lagrangians. It is convenient\nto define them primarily as analytic functions on W \u00d7 W and perform all differential operations with respect to both arguments as independent ones. Of\ncourse, if non-constant, such functions are never real-valued.\n\u0001 However, they\nare constructed so that to be real-valued on Diag W \u00d7 W . If they are ex\u0001\npanded into double power series with respect to the W, W -arguments, their\ncoefficients must show Hermitian symmetry. To be more precise, this concerns\nfunctions of the potential energy type, i.e., which depend only on configurations.\nLagrangians, however, depend on configurations (generalized coordinates) and\nvelocities. So, they are functions on W \u00d7 W \u00d7 W \u00d7 W \u2243 W \u00d7 W \u00d7 W \u00d7 W .\nNevertheless the above statements concerning structure of potentials apply also\nto such tangent-bundle functions: simply W , W are then replaced by W \u00d7 W ,\nW \u00d7 W \u2243 W \u00d7 W.\n1.2.1\n\nLagrangian for the standard Schr\u00f6dinger equation\n\nLet us begin with the usual Schr\u00f6dinger Lagrangian. Later on we shall consider\nthe hierarchy of more and more complicated Lagrangians with the additional\nterms responsible for the various expected physical phenomena.\nDefinition: The usual Schr\u00f6dinger Lagrangian will be denoted by L(1), where\nthe label (1) refers to the resulting first-order differential Euler-Lagrange equation. It is given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\na\na b\na\n \u0307\nb\n(26)\nL(1) = i\u03b1\u0393ab \u03c8 \u03c8\u0307 \u2212 \u03c8 \u03c8 \u2212 \u03b3\u03c7ab \u03c8 \u03c8 b ,\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b3 are some constants, \u03c7 \u2208 W \u2217 \u2297 W \u2217 is a Hermitian form on W , and\nobviously the dot-symbols are time derivatives.\nIt is interesting to mention that Lagrangians of this form appeared in a\nslightly different context in [23, 26]. They were thought on as an alternative\n\n8\n\n\fvariational description of vibrations. And besides, the exchange of energy between real and imaginary parts of \u03c8 a was expected to be some toy model of\ndissipative phenomena (the observed system and its unobserved partner). This\nhas to do with so-called Birchhoffian formulation of dynamical laws.\nSimilar expressions appear also in Kozlov theory of vortices [19] and in his\nstudy of optical, quantum-mechanical and quasiclassical phenomena. In particular, this concerns vortices appearing in hydrodynamical interpretation of the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation and its quasiclassical limit.\nDue to the hermiticity of \u0393 and \u03c7, L(1) is real, i.e.,\nL(1) = L(1),\n\n(27)\n\njust as Lagrangian should be. The corresponding action is given by\nZ\nI(1) = L(1)dt\n\n(28)\n\nand its variational derivative equals\n\u03b4I(1)\na\n\n\u03b4\u03c8 (t)\n\n=\n\n\u2202L(1)\n\u2202\u03c8\n\na\n\n\u2212\n\nd \u2202L(1)\n= 2i\u03b1\u0393ab \u03c8\u0307 b \u2212 \u03b3\u03c7ab \u03c8 b ,\ndt  \u0307 a\n\u2202\u03c8\n\n(29)\n\nwhere, according to the standard procedure mentioned above, \u03c8 and \u03c8 are\nformally treated as independent quantities. Then, obviously, calculated in the\ndual way\nd \u2202L(1)\n\u2202L(1)\n\u03b4I(1)\n\u2212\n=\n(30)\n\u03b4\u03c8 a (t)\n\u2202\u03c8 a\ndt \u2202 \u03c8\u0307 a\nis the complex conjugate of (29). Hence, it is only one of these expressions,\nby convention (29), that is sufficient for obtaining equations of motion (EulerLagrange equations). Putting (29) to vanish one obtains after some manipulations on tensor indices the following equation:\ni\u03b1\n\nd\u03c8 a\n\u03b3\n=\ndt\n2\n\n\u0393\n\n\u03c7\n\n\u0001a\n\nb\u03c8\n\nb\n\n,\n\n(31)\n\nwhere \u0393 \u03c7 = H \u2208 LC (W ) is obtained from \u03c7 \u2208 W \u2217 \u2297 W \u2217 by the \u0393-raising of the\nfirst tensor index, i.e.,\n\u0001a\n(32)\nH a b = \u0393 \u03c7 b = \u0393ac \u03c7cb .\n\nObviously, H = \u0393 \u03c7 is by its very structure Hermitian with respect to \u0393 (\u03c7 itself\nis objectively Hermitian),\n\u0393 (H\u03c8, \u03c6) = \u0393 (\u03c8, H\u03c6) .\n\n(33)\n\nIt is seen that (31) becomes the literally understood Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nwhen \u0393 is positively definite, so in appropriate bases\n[\u0393ab ] = In\n9\n\n(34)\n\n\fand \u03b1 = ~, \u03b3 = 2, where, obviously, ~ is the Planck constant.\nLagrangian (26) is linear in generalized velocities \u03c8\u0307, \u03c8 \u0307 with coefficients depending linearly on generalized coordinates \u03c8, \u03c8. Therefore, the action functional (28) is quadratic with respect to the evolution curve R \u220b t 7\u2192 \u03c8(t) \u2208 W\nand its \"stationarization\" results in first-order linear differential equations for\nb may be\nthe time-dependence of \u03c8. As a matter of fact \u03c7, and then also H,\ntime-dependent, and then the solution is not simply given by the corresponding operator exponent. In \"usual\" analytical mechanics Lagrangians linear in\nvelocities and first-order differential equations of motion are rather exotic (although second-order differential equations may be in an obvious way reduced\nto doubled systems of first-order equations). And the resulting Legendre transformation is evidently non-invertible, one obtains constraints in the phase space\nof the system and the Dirac formalism of singular Hamiltonian mechanics must\nbe used. As we shall see, this formalism for the Schr\u00f6dinger equation has some\ngeometric peculiarities and is interesting in itself.\n1.2.2\n\nAdmitting second derivatives\n\nIf we continue to forget \"hypocritically\" about our quantum motivation, then\nfrom the point of view of purely classical analytical mechanics it is natural to\nask after Lagrangians which lead to terms with second derivatives in equations\nof motion.\nDefinition: Let us denote those Lagrangians by L(1, 2), where the labels (1, 2)\nrefer to the occurrence of first and second time derivatives (velocities and accelerations) in equations of motion. Obviously, the simplest model is\n\u0012\n\u0013\na\na\na\na\n(35)\nL(1, 2) = i\u03b1\u0393ab \u03c8 \u03c8\u0307 b \u2212 \u03c8 \u0307 \u03c8 b + \u03b2\u0393ab \u03c8 \u0307 \u03c8\u0307 b \u2212 \u03b3\u03c7ab \u03c8 \u03c8 b .\nIf \u03b1 = 0, this becomes just the usual Lagrangian of the system of 2n coupled\nharmonic oscillators. However, being motivated by the quantum-mechanical\nproblems and the usual Schr\u00f6dinger equation, we are inclined to retain the\n\u03b1-term; then the quadratic \u03b2-term is some kind of correction. Its physical\ninterpretation in quantum-mechanical terms is still not clear, if possible at all.\ne in the term quadratic\nRemark: One might formally admit to take another \u0393\nin velocities, then Lagrangian would have the following form:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0010\n\u0011\na\na\na b\n \u0307\nb\ne ab \u03c8 \u0307 \u03c8\u0307 b \u2212\u03b3\u03c7ab \u03c8 a \u03c8 b .

Obviously, the resulting equations of motion would be then more\ncomplicated and the symmetry group rather restricted (because it must preserve\ne The mathematical peculiarity of \u0393, \u0393\ne\ntwo different sesquilinear forms \u0393, \u0393).\nproportional to each other is just the \"large\" symmetry group of equations of\nmotion.\nNevertheless, our analysis has some \"quantum\" motivation, where \u0393 is to\nplay the role of scalar product (or some generalised scalar product). And then\nit is more reasonable and physically justified to use only one form \u0393.\nRemark: Structural similarity of Lagrangian (26) to that underlying Dirac\nequation is obvious, although Dirac equation is a partial one, and here for simplicity we deal with ordinary differential equations (finite \"configuration space\").\nThis similarity is not accidental (see e.g. our papers [28, 29, 30, 31]). The same\nconcerns (35) where in the resulting differential equations second-order time\nderivatives are combined with first-order ones [20, 22].\nThe corresponding action functionals will be denoted respectively by\nZ\nZ\ne 2)dt.\ne\n(37)\nI(1, 2) = L(1, 2)dt,\nI(1, 2) = L(1,\n\nPutting \u03b1 = 0 we obtain the \"usual\" Lagrangian of analytical mechanics (for\n2n coupled harmonic oscillators, as said above). The corresponding Lagrangian\nwill be denoted by L(2),\na\n\nL(2) = \u03b2\u0393ab \u03c8 \u0307 \u03c8\u0307 b \u2212 \u03b3\u03c7ab \u03c8 \u03c8 b ,\na\n\n(38)\n\nand its action functional by I(2),\nI(2) =\n\nZ\n\nL(2)dt.\n\n(39)\n\nIt is obvious that\n\u03b4I(1, 2)\na\n\n\u03b4\u03c8 (t)\n\n= 2i\u03b1\u0393ab\n\nd\u03c8 b\nd2 \u03c8 b\n\u2212 \u03b2\u0393ab 2 \u2212 \u03b3\u03c7ab \u03c8 b .\ndt\ndt\n\n(40)\n\nThere is a qualitative catastrophic discontinuity if performing the limit transition \u03b2 \u2192 0 in the corresponding equations of motion:\ni\u03b1\n\n\u03b3\n\u03b2 d2 \u03c8 a\nd\u03c8 a\n= H a b\u03c8b ,\n\u2212\n2\ndt\n2 dt\n2\n\n(41)\n\nwhere the \"quantum\" Hamiltonian H a b is given again by (32). This is nothing\nelse but the special case of the general phenomenon that differential equations\nand phase portraits of the corresponding dynamical systems are drastically unstable with respect to neglecting the highest-order derivative terms.\nObviously, on the level of pure analytical mechanics it is just (38) and (39),\ni.e., \u03b1 = 0 situation, that is the most natural model. If we do not hide the (true)\nquantum-mechanical motivation, then obviously the model (26), i.e., \u03b2 = 0 situation, seems to be just the true model. The natural question arises as to the\n11\n\n\fstatus of the second derivatives. Certain arguments were raised by various authors in favour of the \u03b2-term in L(1, 2), i.e., \"quantum mechanics\" corrected by\nthe second-derivative (\"acceleration\") expression in the equation of evolution\nfor the \"wave function\" \u03c8 [11, 17, 21, 31]. It does not seem yet clear, however, if this term may be made compatible with the statistical interpretation.\nAnd if it is incompatible, what might be a possible alternative interpretation to\nbe used instead. This finite-level problem resembles the interplay of first- and\nsecond-order derivatives of wave amplitudes in Dirac and Klein-Gordon relativistic equations. And it is really a \"discretized\" version of the problem. Moreover,\nthe mixing of terms like in (35) and (41) is known from the field-theoretic treatments. There exist relativistic models in which Dirac and d'Alembert operators\nare superposed [11, 17, 21, 28, 29, 30, 31]. There were various motivations for\nthat. One of them was the demand of conformal invariance and the gauge model\nof gravitation based on the conformal group [17, 28, 29, 30, 31]. Incidentally,\nthe mentioned models have some quite unexpected and interesting consequences\nwhich may be of some relevance for the standard model.\ne\nWe do not discuss here the model (36) with different Hermitian metrics \u0393, \u0393\nfor the first- and second-order terms. Nevertheless, let us quote the expression\nfor its variational derivative and the corresponding \"Schr\u00f6dinger equation\" in\nthe form solved with respect to the first derivatives:\ne 2)\n\u03b4 I(1,\na\n\n\u03b4\u03c8 (t)\n\n2i\u03b1\n\nd\u03c8 a\ndt\n\n2 b\nd\u03c8 b\ne ab d \u03c8 \u2212 \u03b3\u03c7ab \u03c8 b ,\n\u2212 \u03b2\u0393\ndt\ndt2\n\u0010 \u0011a d2 \u03c8 b\ne b\n+ \u03b3H a b \u03c8 b ,\n= \u03b2 \u0393\u0393\ndt2\n\n= 2i\u03b1\u0393ab\n\ne \u2208 L(W ) is given by\nwhere \u0393 \u0393\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011a\ne cb\n\u0393 b := \u0393ac \u0393\n\n\u0393e\n\n(42)\n(43)\n\n(44)\n\nand H = \u0393 \u03c7 \u2208 L(W ) \u2243 W \u2297 W \u2217 is, as usual, the \"Hamiltonian\" (32).\n\n1.3\n\nAdmitting \"potentials\" and direct nonlinearity\n\nThe above models are linear and finite-dimensional with perhaps some timedependent coefficients (\u03c7, or equivalently H). Therefore, they are formally\nequivalent to a finite system of harmonic oscillators with a possible parametrictype excitation. Incidentally, to include non-parametric-type excitation, one\nhas to admit Lagrangians to be general second-order polynomials of the state\nvariables, not necessarily quadratic forms. The terms like\nLexc = Fa \u03c8 a + F a \u03c8\n\na\n\n(45)\n\nwith time-dependent Fa describe in analytical mechanics the extra-imposed external extortion. The resulting Euler-Lagrange equations are affine (\"linear-nonhomogeneous\") but no longer literally linear in state variables. So, although natural and very well known in analytical mechanics, they are outside the scope of\n12\n\n\fquantum mechanics with its linear Schr\u00f6dinger equation. But being once faced\nwith such an \"elementary\" nonlinearity (\"pseudo-nonlinearity\", so to speak, in\nthe sense \"linear-non-homogeneous\" or \"affine\"), one feels motivated to admit\na real, serious nonlinearity by introducing to L some general potential. In analytical mechanics this is something very natural and belonging to the everyday\npractice. The \"usual\" quantum mechanics is linear and within this framework\nsuch corrections might seem exotic. Nevertheless, it is well known that there\nexists some motivation and there were some attempts to introduce nonlinearity\nto quantum mechanics. They have to do with so-called \"paradoxes\" like the\nreduction of wave packet, decoherence, measurement, etc. Many of such attempts were \"blind\" in the sense of introducing nonlinearity \"by hand\" using\nthe trial-and-error methodology. The language of geometric models in analytical mechanics enables one to proceed in a more systematic way basing on some\nnatural guiding hints.\nAs mentioned, the simplest way is to introduce to Lagrangian some potential\nterm V built in a non-quadratic way of the \"wave function\" \u03c8. This is still a\n\"traditional\" way based on some kind of ad hoc \"experiments\" with postulated\npotentials. The method we suggest in this paper, namely the one based on the\ndynamical scalar product, seems much more natural and promising. Nevertheless, let us mention in a few words the traditional procedure.\nDefinition: The corresponding Lagrangians will be denoted by L(dnl), where\n\"dnl\" means \"directly nonlinear\". They may be based either on the Schr\u00f6dinger\nlinear background L(1) (26) or on the linear background L(1, 2) (35) predicting\nthe second-derivative term,\nL(1, dnl) = L(1) + V,\nL(1, 2, dnl) = L(1, 2) + V,\n\n(46)\n(47)\n\nwhere V is just the potential term built in a non-quadratic way of \u03c8 and responsible for the \"direct nonlinearity\".\nThe corresponding contribution to the action functional will be denoted by\nZ\nI(V ) := V dt.\n(48)\nIf we use the complex formalism, it is convenient to follow the procedure described above. Namely, we start from some analytic function of two variables,\nthe\ni.e., V (\u03c8, \u03c6), \u03c8 \u2208 W , \u03c6 \u2208 W , satisfying\n\b\n\u0001 aforementioned hermiticity condition, therefore real on the diagonal \u03c8, \u03c8 : \u03c8 \u2208 W .\nProposition: The most natural expressions are ones built of the obvious ina\nvariant \u0393ab \u03c8 \u03c8 b ,\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0001\na\n(49)\nV \u03c8, \u03c8 = f \u0393ab \u03c8 \u03c8 b ,\nwhere f : R \u2192 R is some real-valued function of one real variable.\nFor example, one can think about the \"quartic\" model often used in quantum\nfield theory and elementary particles physics:\nf (x) = \u03ba(x \u2212 a)2 ,\n13\n\n(50)\n\n\fwhere \u03ba, a \u2208 R denote some real constants.

Before doing this we again return to some\ncomments concerning our complex language. As mentioned, just like in some\nstudies concerning classical field theory and its quantization, it is convenient to\nuse the complex formalism. Let us adapt it to the phase-space description. As\nmentioned, in a fixed basis in W we put\n1\na\n\u03c8 = \u221a (xa \u2212 iy a ) ,\n2\n\n1\n\u03c8 a = \u221a (xa + iy a ) ,\n2\n\n(55)\n\nwhere xa , y a form a system of 2n real coordinates in the configuration space.\nIn other words, we perform analytical continuation from the real form of W\nto the complex\u0001 space W \u00d7 W and then perform the restriction to the diagonal\nDiag W \u00d7 W (25). If we use the language of real geometry, the canonical\nmomenta conjugate to (xa , y a ) are denoted respectively by (ua , va ). They are\ncoordinates in the dual space W \u2217 (as a real space). In the language of complex\n\u2217\ngeometry, we use the momentum space W \u2217 \u0010\n\u00d7 W , i.e.,\n\u0011 the phase space W \u00d7\na\n\u2217\nW \u00d7 W \u2217 \u00d7 W . The momenta conjugate to \u03c8 a , \u03c8 are denoted by (\u03c0a , \u03c0 a ),\nwhere obviously\n1\n\u03c0a = \u221a (ua \u2212 iva ) ,\n2\n\n1\n\u03c0 a = \u221a (ua + iva ) .\n2\n\n14\n\n(56)\n\n\fInverting formulae (55), (56) we obtain\n\u0011\n1 \u0010\na\nxa = \u221a \u03c8 a + \u03c8 ,\n2\n1\nua = \u221a (\u03c0a + \u03c0 a ) ,\n2\n\n\u0011\ni \u0010\na\nya = \u2212 \u221a \u03c8a \u2212 \u03c8 ,\n2\ni\nva = \u221a (\u03c0a \u2212 \u03c0 a ) .\n2\n\n(57)\n(58)\n\nFormally\u0001 we are dealing here with the orthogonal change of variables from (x, y)\nto \u03c8, \u03c8 with the block matrix\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\nIn iIn\n\u221a\n,\n(59)\n2 In \u2212iIn\nwhere In obviously denotes the n \u00d7 n identity matrix. Transformation from\n(u, v) to (\u03c0, \u03c0) is obviously given by the contragradient (inverse and transposed)\nmatrix. The relationship between differential operators\nin (x, y; u, v) and the\n\u0001\ncorresponding analytical continuation to \u03c8, \u03c8; \u03c0, \u03c0 is evidently given by\n\u2202\ni \u2202\ni \u2202\n,\n= \u221a\n\u2212\u221a\na\na\n\u2202y\n2 \u2202\u03c8\n2 \u2202\u03c8a\ni \u2202\ni \u2202\n\u2202\n= \u2212\u221a\n+\u221a\n,\n\u2202va\n2 \u2202\u03c0a\n2 \u2202\u03c0 a\n\n\u2202\n1 \u2202\n1 \u2202\n,\n=\u221a\n+\u221a\na\na\n\u2202x\n2 \u2202\u03c8\n2 \u2202\u03c8 a\n1 \u2202\n1 \u2202\n\u2202\n= \u221a\n+\u221a\n,\n\u2202ua\n2 \u2202\u03c0a\n2 \u2202\u03c0 a\n\n(60)\n\n(61)\n\nand conversely\n1 \u2202\ni \u2202\n= \u221a\n+\u221a\n,\na\n2 \u2202x\n2 \u2202y a\n\u2202\u03c8\n1 \u2202\n\u2202\ni \u2202\n=\u221a\n\u2212\u221a\n.\n\u2202\u03c0 a\n2 \u2202ua\n2 \u2202va\n\n1 \u2202\ni \u2202\n\u2202\n= \u221a\n\u2212\u221a\n,\na\na\n\u2202\u03c8\n2 \u2202x\n2 \u2202y a\n\u2202\n1 \u2202\ni \u2202\n=\u221a\n+\u221a\n,\n\u2202\u03c0a\n2 \u2202ua\n2 \u2202va\n\n\u2202\n\na\n\n(62)\n(63)\n\nThe symplectic form\n\u03b3 = dua \u2227 dxa + dva \u2227 dy a ,\n\n(64)\n\nafter analytical continuation looks as follows:\n\na\n\n\u03b3 = d\u03c0a \u2227 d\u03c8 a + d\u03c0 a \u2227 d\u03c8 ,\n\n(65)\n\nand, as expected, the Poisson brackets\n{f, g} =\n\n\u2202f \u2202g\n\u2202f \u2202g\n\u2202f \u2202g\n\u2202f \u2202g\n+ a\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2202xa \u2202ua\n\u2202y \u2202va\n\u2202ua \u2202xa\n\u2202va \u2202y a\n\n(66)\n\nafter analytical continuation become\n{f, g} =\n\n\u2202f \u2202g\n\u2202f \u2202g\n\u2202f \u2202g\n\u2202f \u2202g\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n.\na \u2202\u03c0\na\na\n\u2202\u03c8 a \u2202\u03c0a\n\u2202\u03c0\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u2202\u03c0\na\na\na \u2202\u03c8\n\u2202\u03c8\n\n(67)\n\nHamiltonian vector fields with generators F ,\nXF =\n\n\u2202F \u2202\n\u2202F \u2202\n\u2202F \u2202\n\u2202F \u2202\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n,\n\u2202ua \u2202xa\n\u2202va \u2202y a \u2202xa \u2202ua \u2202y a \u2202va\n15\n\n(68)\n\n\fbecome obviously\nXF =\n\n\u2202F \u2202\n\u2202F \u2202\n\u2202F \u2202\n\u2202F \u2202\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n.\na\n\u2202\u03c0a \u2202\u03c8 a\n\u2202\u03c0 a \u2202\u03c8 a\n\u2202\u03c8 a \u2202\u03c0a\n\u2202\u03c8 \u2202\u03c0 a\n\n(69)\n\nLet us quote some additional obvious formulae which often appear in our\ncalculus concerning the above and other formulae:\n+\n*\n\u001c\n\u001d\n\u2202\n\u2202\na\na\na\n= 0,\n(70)\nd\u03c8 ,\n= \u03b4 b,\nd\u03c8 ,\nb\n\u2202\u03c8 b\n\u2202\u03c8\n+\n*\n\u001c\n\u001d\n\u2202\n\u2202\na\na\nd\u03c8 ,\n= \u03b4ab.\n(71)\n= 0,\nd\u03c8 ,\nb\n\u2202\u03c8 b\n\u2202\u03c8\nSimilarly,\n\u001d\n\u001c\n\u2202\n= 0,\nd\u03c8 a ,\n\u2202\u03c0b\n\u001c\n\u001d\n\u2202\nd\u03c0a ,\n= \u03b4a b ,\n\u2202\u03c0b\n\n\u001c\n\u001d\n\u2202\nd\u03c8 a ,\n= 0,\n\u2202\u03c0 b\n\u001d\n\u001c\n\u2202\n= 0,\nd\u03c0a ,\n\u2202\u03c8 b\n\n(72)\n...\n\n(73)\n\nConcerning the formulae like (65), (67), (69), and so on, it must be stated\nthat working in the \"configuration space\" W \u00d7 W and the \"phase space\" W \u00d7\n\u2217\nW \u00d7 W \u2217 \u00d7 W is an auxiliary tool, although very convenient one. However,\nthe true \"physical\" phenomena take place in W and W \u00d7 W \u2217 as the configuration and phase spaces,\nrespectively. Fortunately, the analytical continuation\n\u0001\nfrom Diag W \u00d7 W enables one to work almost automatically in the mentioned\nspaces of the doubled dimension.\n1.4.1\n\nLegendre transformation, constraints, Dirac procedure\n\nLet us consider the Legendre transformation based on the usual Schr\u00f6dinger\nLagrangian (26). As the corresponding action functional \u03c8 7\u2192 I(1)(\u03c8) is quadratic and the resulting \"equations of motion\" are linear, this study is rather\nacademic. Nevertheless, it remains essentially valid when some\n\u0001 direct nonlinearity is introduced by the \"potential energy\" term V \u03c8, \u03c8 and everything\nbecomes especially instructive when the term quadratic in velocities is introduced, i.e., if we consider the model L(1, 2) (35) and the problem of the limit\ntransition \u03b2 \u2192 0, a very singular one. For the pure model L(1) the Legendre\ntransformation has the following form:\nb\n\n\u03c0 a = \u2212i\u03b1\u0393ab \u03c8 b ,\n\n\u03c0a = i\u03b1\u0393ba \u03c8 ,\n\n(74)\n\nthe second equation being the complex conjugate of the first one; this is the\nobvious redundancy following from the use of complex language. It is seen\nthat canonical momenta are completely independent of generalized velocities,\nso this is an extreme case of singular Dirac mechanics (compare the situation,\n16\n\n\fby the way, with one for the relativistic Dirac equation). Therefore, the primary\nconstraints are redundantly described by equations\n\u03c6a = 0,\n\n\u03c6a = 0,\n\n(75)\n\n\u03c6a = \u03c0 a + i\u03b1\u0393ab \u03c8 b .\n\n(76)\n\nwhere\nb\n\n\u03c6a = \u03c0a \u2212 i\u03b1\u0393ba \u03c8 ,\n\nAccording to the general rules of Lagrangian-Hamiltonian mechanics, the \"energy\" function e is given by\ne = \u03c8\u0307 a\n\na \u2202L\n\u2202L\n\u2212 L,\n+ \u03c8 \u0307\na\na\n\u2202 \u03c8\u0307\n\u2202 \u03c8 \u0307\n\n(77)\n\nin this case L = L(1) (26). Of course, one should not confuse this \"energy\" in\nthe sense of Hamiltonian mechanics with quantum energy given by the Hamilton\noperator (32). After some trivial calculations we obtain that\na\n\ne = \u03b3\u03c7ab \u03c8 \u03c8 b ,\n\n(78)\n\nso the \"energy\" function e is independent of generalized velocities - a rather\nexotic property. As usually, e is a pull-back, under Legendre transformation L,\nof some \"Hamiltonian\" h defined only on the manifold\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u2217\n(79)\nM = L W \u00d7 W \u00d7 W\u2217 \u00d7 W\n\nof primary Dirac constraints in the phase space of the system. However, according to the traditional procedure of Dirac, it is convenient to use the family of\n\u2217\n\"Hamiltonians\" H defined on the \"total phase space\" W \u00d7 W \u00d7 W \u2217 \u00d7 W and\nhaving the property that\nH|M = h.\n(80)\n\nThe standard procedure is to fix any such a Hamiltonian H0 and then to put\na\n\nH = H0 + \u03bba \u03c6a + \u03bb \u03c6a\n\n(81)\n\na\n\nwith yet undetermined Lagrange factors \u03bba , \u03bb . The most natural, almost\ncanonical choice is\na\n(82)\nH0 = \u03b3\u03c7ab \u03c8 \u03c8 b .\nThen, following the well-known Dirac procedure, one must determine the submanifold Ms of secondary constraints, eliminate as fast as possible the above\na\nLagrange coefficients \u03bba , \u03bb (\"gauge variables\"), define the effective Hamiltonian on Ms and the corresponding Poisson brackets of functions on Ms (Dirac\nbrackets in a sense). The first step is to calculate Hamiltonian vector fields XH ,\nXH = XH0 + X\u03bba \u03c6a + X\u03bba \u03c6 .\na\n\n17\n\n(83)\n\n\fMore precisely, it is sufficient to take the simplified form of XH , namely,\na\n\nXH = XH0 + \u03bba X\u03c6a + \u03bb X\u03c6 ,\n\n(84)\n\na\n\nbecause the expressions (83), (84) evidently coincide on the manifold of primary\nconstraints. Then, the care must be taken to make XH compatible with constraints M , i.e., being tangent to it. At points of non-tangency the dynamics is\ninconsistent.\nIt is a trivial task to calculate the contractions of differentials of (75), (76)\nwith the vector fields (83), (84). As differentials of constraints equations are\n\u2217\ngiven in the redundant space W \u00d7 W \u00d7 W \u2217 \u00d7 W by\nd\n\nd\u03c6c = d\u03c0 c + i\u03b1\u0393cd d\u03c8 d ,\n\nd\u03c6c = d\u03c0c \u2212 i\u03b1\u0393dc d\u03c8 ,\n\n(85)\n\nthe tangency conditions\nhd\u03c6c , XH i = 0,\n\nd\u03c6c , XH = 0\n\n(86)\n\na\n\nhave obviously the unique solutions for \u03bba , \u03bb , i.e.,\n\u03bba = \u2212\n\ni \u03b3 ac\n\u0393 \u03c7cb \u03c8 b ,\n2\u03b1\n\na\n\n\u03bb =\n\ni\u03b3 b\n\u03c8 \u03c7bc \u0393ca ,\n2\u03b1\n\n(87)\n\nall over the primary constraints manifold M . No additional restrictions are\nimposed on the admissible points of M and because of this the secondary constraints Ms (in the Dirac sense) coincide with the manifold of primary constraints. No gauge freedom appears because at all points of M = Ms the Lagrange multipliers are uniquely defined by (87). The momentum variables \u03c0a , \u03c0 a\na\nare uniquely determined by the generalized coordinates \u03c8 a , \u03c8 . Let iM = iMs\ndenote the natural injection of M = Ms into the phase space manifold, then\n\u03b3||M = \u03b3||Ms = i\u2217M \u03b3 = i\u2217Ms \u03b3,\n\n(88)\n\ni.e., the restriction of the natural symplectic two-form on the primary phase\nspace P to M = Ms is simply given by\na\n\n\u03b3||M = \u03b3||Ms = 2i\u03b1\u0393ab d\u03c8 \u2227 d\u03c8 b .\n\n(89)\na\n\nRoughly speaking, this means that on M = Ms the quantities \u03c8 become effectively the canonical momenta conjugate to \u03c8 a as the generalized coordinates\n(obviously, up to the linear transformation with matrix 2i\u03b1\u0393ab ).\nSome subtle points appear here due to the use of complex coordinates \u03c8 a .\nSince their number is arbitrary, it takes any admissible value n, not necessarily\nan even one as it must be in symplectic manifolds. But M = Ms has the\ncomplex dimension n, whereas its real one is always even and equals 2n, cf. the\nformulae (55)\u2013(58), (60)\u2013(65). Therefore, the n complex parameters\nb\n\n\u03a0a = 2i\u03b1\u03c8 \u0393ba\n18\n\n(90)\n\n\freally provide the complex representation of the canonical momenta conjugate\nto \u03c8 a . Let us describe this effectively in terms of real parameters (57), (58).\nSome remark is necessary here to avoid the conflict (the multiplier 2) between\nthe last comment concerning (90) and the formulae (74) describing the Legendre\ntransformation in terms of complex variables. Namely, (89) and (90) describe\nthe effective Darboux representation in the constraints manifold M = Ms , not\nin the original non-restricted phase space.\nTake the formula (89) and express it in terms of some fixed basis (. . . , ea , . . .)\nintroducing the corresponding real coordinates xa , y a (57). Let us express \u0393ab\nin terms of this particular basis,\n\u0393ab = Sab + iAab ,\n\n(91)\n\nwhere Sab , Aab are respectively symmetric and anti-symmetric real matrices,\nSab = Sba ,\n\nAab = \u2212Aba ,\n\n(92)\n\nalways related to this particular choice of basis. Then after straightforward\ncalculation one obtains\n\u0001\n\u03b3||M = \u03b3||Ms = \u22122\u03b1Sab dxa \u2227 dy b \u2212 \u03b1Aab dxa \u2227 dxb + dy a \u2227 dy b .\n(93)\n\nProposition: If the complex basis (. . . , ea , . . .) is chosen in such a way that\nAab = 0,\n\nSab =\n\n1\n\u03b4ab\n2\u03b1\n\n(94)\n\n(it is always possible when \u0393 is Hermitian and positively definite), then\n\u03b3||M = \u03b3||Ms = \u03b4ab dy b \u2227 dxa = dya \u2227 dxa .\n\n(95)\n\nSo, we conclude that indeed, from the point of view of real linear structure,\nM = Ms is a real symplectic manifold with Darboux coordinates xa (effective\ngeneralized coordinates) and ya = \u03b4ab y b (generalized conjugate momenta). So\nindeed, from the point of view of real symplectic geometry, M = Ms is a purely\nsecond-class manifold (in Dirac language). The effective Hamiltonian responsible for the L-dynamics is given on M = Ms by\nH = H0 |M = H0 |Ms ,\n\n(96)\n\ni.e., (82). Let us substitute again the coordinates as above and put\n\u03c7ab = \u03c3ab + i\u03b1ab ,\n\n(97)\n\nwhere again \u03c3, \u03b1 are real and respectively symmetric and anti-symmetric matrices. We obtain\n\u0001 \u03b3\n\u0001\n\u03b3\n(98)\nH = \u03c3ab y a y b + xa xb + \u03b1ab xb y a \u2212 xa y b .\n2\n2\n19\n\n\fThis is the real form of the reduced Hamiltonian of dynamics derived from the\nSchr\u00f6dinger Lagrangian. The equations of motion have the form of the Hamilton\nequations with the symplectic form (95), xa , ya = \u03b4ab y b being respectively\ncanonical coordinates and their conjugate momenta, with the standard Poisson\nbrackets.\nRemark: The first term in (98) is the usual isotropic harmonic oscillator\n(isotropic in the sense of \u03c3ab , not Sab , unless both are proportional to each\nother); the second one is not particularly important because for the Hermitian\nbilinear forms \u03c7ab , \u0393ab , when in addition \u0393 is positively definite, it is always\npossible to choose a basis (. . . , ea , . . .) in which simultaneously \u0393 is \u03b4-like and \u03c7\nis symmetric, i.e.,\n\u03b1ab = 0,\n(99)\nmoreover, \u03c7 is then real-diagonal. Formally it is not necessary to assume that\n[\u03c7ab ], [\u03c3ab ] must be positively definite. If they are not, the mentioned interpretation in terms of the usual harmonic oscillator is not literally true.\nIt is perhaps instructive to express everything in terms of the real variables\n(57), (58), although the complex ones (55), (56) are formally more convenient,\neven in field-theoretic problems. We did this partially in formulae (64)\u2013(69), etc.\nLet us now look what is the real representation of the Legendre transformation\n(74) and some resulting relationships. It is easy to show that the Legendre\ntransformations become\nua = \u03b1Aab xb + \u03b1Sab y b ,\n\nva = \u2212\u03b1Sab xb + \u03b1Aab y b .\n\n(100)\n\nProposition: If the basis (. . . , ea , . . .) is chosen in such a way that (94) holds,\nthen one obtains simply that\nua =\n\n1\nva = \u2212 \u03b4ab xb .\n2\n\n1\n\u03b4ab y b ,\n2\n\n(101)\n\nProposition: It is perhaps a little pretentious and artificially sophisticated, but\nnevertheless instructive and aesthetic to admit more general bases (. . . , ea , . . .)\nin which\n1\nSab =\ngab ,\n(102)\n2\u03b1\nwhere gab = gba and in \"physical\" models the matrix [gab ] is positively definite.\nIt plays the role of the Euclidean metric tensor in the n-dimensional real linear\nspace U composed of linear combinations \u03bba ea with real coefficients \u03bba \u2208 R\n(the R-linear shell of the system of vectors ea , a = 1, n). Obviously, the linear\nquantities\nya := gab y b\n(103)\nmay be interpreted as components of U -covariant vectors, y \u2208 U \u2217 . Then (93)\nbecomes\nab\n\n\u03b3||M = \u03b3||Ms = dya \u2227 dxa \u2212 \u03b1Aab dxa \u2227 dxb \u2212 \u03b1 (g A) dya \u2227 dyb ,\n\n20\n\n(104)\n\n\fwhere g A is obtained from A by the g-raising of indices,\nab\n\n(g A) = g ac g bd Acd .\n(105)\n\u0002\n\u0003\nWe avoid to write simply Aab because this might be confused with the\ncontravariant inverse of [Aab ], non-existing in our typically physical situations.\nIn such situations we have just the following form of (95):\n\u03b3||M = \u03b3||Ms = dya \u2227 dxa .\n\n(106)\n\ni\n\u03b3 g ab\n\u03b3\n\u03b3hg b\n( \u03b1) a \u2212 (g \u03b1)a b xa yb ,\n( \u03c3) ya yb + \u03c3ab xa xb +\n2\n2\n2\n\n(107)\n\nAnd (98) becomes then\nH=\n\nwhere the label \"g\" refers to the g-raising of indices,\nab\n\n(g \u03c3)\n\n:= g ac \u03c3cd g db ,\n\n(g \u03b1)\n\nb\na\n\n:= g bc \u03b1ca ,\n\n(g \u03b1)a b := \u03b1ac g cb .\n\n(108)\n\nThe upper-case indices at g refer to the \"contravariant inverse\", g ac gcb = \u03b4 a b .\nWe write (g \u03c3)ab instead of \u03c3 ab because the latter might be confused with the\n\"contravariant inverse\" of \u03c3 ab which is obviously something else than the gshifted object appearing in (108).\nRemark: The first term in (107) refers to the kinetic energy of the x-oscillator,\nthe second one is its potential energy. The third term is more peculiar. It\ncorresponds to something which formally looks like the constant magnetic field\nof induction tensor proportional to\nfab = \u03b3\u03b1ab = \u2212fba\n\n(109)\n\nand the covector potential proportional to the linear field\nak = \u03b3\u03b1kl xl .\n\n(110)\n\nIn this language the Legendre transformation (100) has the following form:\n1\nua = \u03b1Aab xb + gab y b ,\n2\n\n1\nva = \u2212 gab xb + \u03b1Aab y b ,\n2\n\n(111)\n\nand obviously (101) (A is eliminated) becomes\nua =\n1.4.2\n\n1\ngab y b ,\n2\n\n1\nva = \u2212 gab xb .\n2\n\n(112)\n\nCanonical formalism with \"direct\" nonlinearity\n\nQuite independently on our quantum motivation (sometimes more or less hidden), the above study is an interesting and instructive example of how the Dirac\nprocedure of Lagrangian constraints works in a rather non-typical situation. One\nmight object here against using the heavy formalism for the geometric discussion\nof something that is technically simple: non-dissipative linear finite-dimensional\n21\n\n\fobject, formally equivalent to some system of coupled harmonic oscillators, perhaps parametrically excited when \u03c7 does depend explicitly on time. It is well\nknown from the theory of linear differential equations in Rk -spaces that technically everything is reducible to matrix exponents. Nevertheless, the structures\nrevealed and discussed here may be very useful in the infinite-dimensional case.\nAnd besides, they may be a good starting point towards discussing generalized\nmodels admitting nonlinearities and second-order time derivatives. Nonlinearities introduced by the V -terms in (46), in particular the ones of the form (49),\n(50), do not modify the above canonical formalism in an essential way. Namely,\nthe Legendre transformation is given by the same formulae (74) resulting in\nthe same primary constraints M (75), (76). According to the formula (77), the\nexpression for the \"energy\" (78) is modified by the V -term:\n\u0001\na\ne = \u03b3\u03c7ab \u03c8 \u03c8 b + V \u03c8, \u03c8 .\n(113)\nTherefore, the background Hamiltonian (82) in (81) is replaced by\n\u0001\na\nH0 = \u03b3\u03c7ab \u03c8 \u03c8 b + V \u03c8, \u03c8 .\n\n(114)\n\nThis implies that the vector field (84) is modified by the following additive\ncorrection term:\n\u2202V \u2202\n\u2202V \u2202\n\u2212\n.\n(115)\nXV = \u2212 a\na\n\u2202\u03c8 \u2202\u03c0a\n\u2202\u03c8 \u2202\u03c0 a\nFor example, for the quartic model\n\u00112\n\u0010\na\nV = A \u0393ab \u03c8 \u03c8 b ,\n\nwhere A \u2208 R is some constant, we have\n\u0011 b\n\u0011\n\u0010 c\n\u0010 c\n\u2202V\n\u2202V\n= 2A \u03c8 \u0393cd \u03c8 d \u0393ab \u03c8 b .\n= 2A \u03c8 \u0393cd \u03c8 d \u03c8 \u0393ba ,\na\na\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u2202\u03c8\n\n(116)\n\n(117)\n\nIn virtue of the assumed non-singularity of \u0393, the corresponding equations\n(81), (86) are again uniquely solvable with respect to the Lagrange multipliers\nat any point of the primary constraints M . The only difference in comparison\nwith (87) is that some additional V -dependent terms appear:\n\u03bba = \u2212\n\ni \u03b3 ac\ni ac \u2202V\n,\n\u0393 \u03c7cb \u03c8 b \u2212\n\u0393\nc\n2\u03b1\n2\u03b1\n\u2202\u03c8\n\na\n\n\u03bb =\n\ni \u2202V ca\ni\u03b3 b\n\u03c8 \u03c7bc \u0393ca +\n\u0393 . (118)\n2\u03b1\n2\u03b1 \u2202\u03c8 c\n\nThe existence of these unique solutions all over M implies that again the secondary constraints Ms are identical with the primary ones M , and that they\nare second-class constraints, i.e., M = Ms is a symplectic manifold in the sense\nof the structure induced by the symplectic form of the original phase space.\nReferring to formulae (32) we can simply rewrite (118) as follows:\n\u03bba = \u2212\n\ni \u2202V\ni\u03b3 a b\n,\nH b\u03c8 \u2212\n2\u03b1\n2\u03b1 \u2202\u03c8 a\n\na\n\n\u03bb =\n\n22\n\ni \u2202V\ni\u03b3 b a\n\u03c8 Hb +\n,\n2\u03b1\n2\u03b1 \u2202\u03c8 a\n\n(119)\n\n\fwith the suggestive, although not very correct, abbreviation:\n\u2202V\n\u2202V\n:= \u0393ac c ,\n\u2202\u03c8a\n\u2202\u03c8\n\n\u2202V\n\u2202V ca\n:=\n\u0393 .\nc\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u2202\u03c8 a\n\n(120)\n\nRemark: Let us be careful: as it is mentioned many times, the \"Hamiltonian\"\n(114) is something completely else than the \"true\" quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian appearing in the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, even if the non-quadratic term\nV responsible for the direct nonlinearity does not occur at all. Nevertheless, it\nis still responsible for the directly nonlinear quantum evolution of \u03c8 as derived\nfrom our Lagrangian model.\nUsing the M -reduced canonical momenta (90)\nb\n\n\u03a0a = \u22122i\u03b1\u0393ab \u03c8 b\n\n\u03a0a = 2i\u03b1\u03c8 \u0393ba ,\na\n\n(121)\n\nconjugate respectively to \u03c8 a and \u03c8 and then eliminating the redundancy, we\nfind again that according to (89) \u03c8 and \u03c8 are respectively (of course up to normalisation) the generalized complex coordinates and their conjugate momenta\non M = Ms , namely\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\b a b\n1 ab\na\nb\nb\n\u03c8 , \u03c8 M = 0,\n\u0393 .\n\u03c8 ,\u03c8\n= 0,\n\u03c8a , \u03c8\n=\n(122)\n2i\u03b1\nM\nM\nWriting the Hamilton equations of motion on M = Ms in the following form:\nd\u03c8 a\n= {\u03c8 a , H}M\ndt\n\n(123)\n\nor, equivalently,\n\na\nn a o\nd\u03c8\n(124)\n= \u03c8 ,H\ndt\nM\nwith the effective Hamiltonian H on M = Ms given by (78), (80), (82) and\nmaking use of all standard properties of Poisson brackets, we obtain respectively\n\ni~\n\nd\u03c8 a\ndt\n\n\u2202V\n1\n,\n= H a b \u03c8 b + \u0393ab\nb\n2\n\u2202\u03c8\n\n(125)\n\n1 \u2202V ba\n\u0393 ,\n2 \u2202\u03c8 b\n\n(126)\n\na\n\nd\u03c8\n\u2212i~\ndt\n\nb\n\n= \u03c8 Hb a +\n\nwhich are evidently complex conjugates of each other. Obviously, just as previously, we have put\n\u03b1 = ~,\n\u03b3 = 2,\n(127)\neven if our interpretation is purely classical. Those are finite-level\n\u0001 Schr\u00f6dinger\nequations with possibly nonlinear terms controlled by V \u03c8, \u03c8 . We use the\nterm \"direct nonlinearity\" to stress the fact that \u0393 is fixed and the possible\nnonlinearity is just introduced as the perturbation term built of V .\nThis is the model suggested by analytical mechanics in the W -space endowed\nwith \u0393-geometry of the Hermitian type. Before we go any further towards\nsome non-direct, geometry-based nonlinearity of non-perturbative type, some\ncomments are necessary.\n23\n\n\f1.4.3\n\nRemoving Dirac constraints by second-order terms\n\nTraditional analytical mechanics of classical oscillatory systems with a linear\nbackground suggests Lagrangians of the form (38), quadratic in \u03c8 and perhaps\ncorrected by some anharmonic perturbation (the quartic model of the correction\nto the Lagrangian seems to be the most popular one, although, of course, some\ntrigonometric, hyperbolic and logarithmic corrections are also used and well\nmotivated). On the other side, the Schr\u00f6dinger-type Lagrangian (26) describes\nthe usual linear quantum mechanics. Lagrangian (38) quadratic in derivatives\ndoes not imply any Dirac singularity; the Legendre transformation is invertible,\nassuming of course (what we do) that \u0393 is not degenerate (in standard theory it\nis just positively definite). Therefore, the natural temptation appears to admit\nLagrangians L(1, 2) (35) perhaps with a possible anharmonic correction V , when\nit becomes L(1, 2, dnl) (47), i.e., the second-order polynomial of velocities with a\ndirect nonlinearity. From the Dirac point of view the term quadratic in velocities\nintroduces some kind of \"regularization\" because Legendre transformation is\nthen invertible. It is invertible for any, even very small, non-vanishing value of\n|\u03b2|. Without the V -term one obtains from the variation of \u03c8 the second-order\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation (41); the term \"Schr\u00f6dinger\" becomes literally true when\nwe put (127), i.e., \u03b1 = ~, \u03b3 = 2. The variation with respect to \u03c8 itself leads\nto the complex-conjugate equation for \u03c8. In a sense \u03b2 is an additional \"Planck\nconstant\". Admitting a direct nonlinearity via the \"potential\" V in (47), we\nobtain the second-order nonlinear \"Schr\u00f6dinger equation\"\ni~\n\nd\u03c8 a\n\u2202V\n1\n\u03b2 d2 \u03c8 a\n= H a b \u03c8 b + \u0393ab\n\u2212\n2\nb\ndt\n2 dt\n2\n\u2202\u03c8\n\n(128)\n\nand obviously its complex conjugate\na\n\na\n\nd\u03c8\n1 \u2202V ba\n\u03b2 d2 \u03c8\nb\n\u2212 i~\n= \u03c8 Hb a +\n\u0393 .\n\u2212\ndt\n2 dt2\n2 \u2202\u03c8 b\n\n(129)\n\nIn other words, we have the following expression for the variational derivative:\n\u03b4I(1, 2, dnl)\na\n\n\u03b4\u03c8 (t)\n\n= 2i~\u0393ab\n\nd\u03c8 b\nd2 \u03c8 b\n\u2202V\n\u2212 \u03b2\u0393ab 2 \u2212 \u03b3Hab \u03c8 b \u2212\n,\na\ndt\ndt\n\u2202\u03c8\n\n(130)\n\nwhere \u03b3 = 2 if for \u03b2 = 0 we are to obtain the usual Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\nObviously, performing the variation with respect to \u03c8 a , we obtain the complexconjugate expression\nb\n\nb\n\nd2 \u03c8\n\u2202V\n\u03b4I(1, 2, dnl)\nd\u03c8\nb\n.\n= \u22122i~\n\u0393ba \u2212 \u03b2 2 \u0393ba \u2212 \u03b3\u03c8 Hba \u2212\na\n\u03b4\u03c8 (t)\ndt\ndt\n\u2202\u03c8 a\n1.4.4\n\n(131)\n\nSome physical interpretation of second derivatives\n\nIt is interesting to mention that there is some motivation from other physical\nproblems to admit the term with \u03c8-accelerations, i.e., with the second-order time\n24\n\n\fderivatives introduced to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. For instance, similar ideas\nwere proposed and studied quite a long time ago by A. Barut and more recently\nhave been re-investigated by V. V. Dvoeglazov, S. Kruglov, J. P. Vigier and\nothers (see, e.g., [11, 21] and references therein). Among others there is also an\ninteresting article where the authors used the analogy between the Schr\u00f6dinger\nand Fourier equations for nanoscience [20, 22]. The short description of the idea\nis presented below.\nHence, the quantum Fourier equation which describes the heat (mass) diffusion on the atomic level has the following form:\n\u2202T\n~\n= \u22072 T.\n\u2202t\nm\n\n(132)\n\nIf we make the substitutions t \u2192 it/2 and T \u2192 \u03c8, then we end up with the free\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation:\n\u2202\u03c8\n~2 2\ni~\n=\u2212\n\u2207 \u03c8.\n(133)\n\u2202t\n2m\nThe complete Schr\u00f6dinger equation with the potential term V after the reverse\nsubstitutions t \u2192 \u22122it and \u03c8 \u2192 T gives us the parabolic quantum FokkerPlanck equation, which describes the quantum heat transport for \u25b3t > \u03c4 , where\n\u03c4 = ~/m\u03b12 c2 \u223c 10\u221217 sec and c\u03c4 \u223c 1 nm, i.e.,\n~\n2V\n\u2202T\n= \u22072 T \u2212\nT.\n\u2202t\nm\n~\n\n(134)\n\nFor ultrashort time processes when \u25b3t < \u03c4 one obtains the generalized quantum\nhyperbolic heat transport equation\n\u03c4\n\n\u2202T\n~\n2V\n\u22022T\n+\n= \u22072 T \u2212\nT\n2\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\nm\n~\n\n(135)\n\n(its structure and solutions for ultrashort thermal processes were investigated in\n[20]) which leads us to the following second-order modified Schr\u00f6dinger equation:\ni~\n\n~2 2\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u22022\u03c8\n+ 2\u03c4 ~ 2 = \u2212\n\u2207 \u03c8 + V \u03c8,\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n2m\n\n(136)\n\nwhere the additional term with the second-order time derivative describes the\ninteraction of electrons with surrounding space-time filled with virtual positronelectron pairs. It is easy to see that (136) is analogous to (41) if we suppose\nthat\n\u03b1 = ~,\n\u03b2 = \u22124\u03c4 ~,\n\u03b3 = 2.\n(137)\nRemark: obviously, an important question appears: is for such a second-order\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation something like the probabilistic interpretation still possible? And if not, what is it to be replaced by? Those are still open questions,\nalthough some comments will be given below. In a sense the problem is like\none of the quantum-mechanical interpretation of the Klein-Gordon equation\nversus the Schr\u00f6dinger or Dirac equations. In our opinion it is impossible to\n25\n\n\fanswer all questions at once, so it is a reasonable way to discuss consequently\nany geometrically interesting ideas without waiting for their immediate, perhaps premature, physical interpretation. Otherwise one repeats some mistake\nmade by Schr\u00f6dinger who rejected his second-order partial differential equation\nknown today as the Klein-Gordon equation.\n1.4.5\n\nRegular Legendre transformation and canonical formalism\n\nIf in (35), (47) one admits the term quadratic in velocities, i.e., non-vanishing\n\u03b2, then the Legendre transformation becomes as follows:\n\u03c0a\n\n=\n\n\u03c0a\n\n=\n\n\u2202L(1, 2, dnl)\n\u2202 \u03c8\u0307 a\n\n=\n\n\u2202L(1, 2)\n\u2202 \u03c8\u0307 a\n\nb\nb\n= i\u03b1\u03c8 \u0393ba + \u03b2 \u03c8 \u0307 \u0393ba ,\n\n\u2202L(1, 2, dnl)\n\u2202L(1, 2)\n=\n= \u2212i\u03b1\u0393ab \u03c8 b + \u03b2\u0393ab \u03c8\u0307 b .\na\na\n \u0307\n \u0307\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u2202\u03c8\n\n(138)\n(139)\n\nThe corresponding \"energy\" function of Lagrangian model is given by\na\n\u0001\na\ne = \u03b2\u0393ab \u03c8 \u0307 \u03c8\u0307 b + \u03b3\u03c7ab \u03c8 \u03c8 b + V \u03c8, \u03c8 .\n\n(140)\n\nNo constraints in the classical phase space appear, so the Legendre transformation is invertible and its inverse has the following form:\n\u03c8\u0307 a =\n\n1 ab\ni\u03b1\n\u0393 \u03c0b + \u03c8a ,\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\na\n1\ni\u03b1 a\n\u03c8 \u0307 = \u03c0b \u0393ba \u2212 \u03c8 .\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\n(141)\n\nThe corresponding \"Hamiltonian\" is globally defined on the phase space:\n\u0013\ni\u0011 \u0012 \u03b12\nh\n\u0001\n1 \u0010 ab\na\na\n+\n\u0393 \u03c0a \u03c0 b + i\u03b1 \u03c0a \u03c8 a \u2212 \u03c0 a \u03c8\n\u0393ab + \u03b3\u03c7ab \u03c8 \u03c8 b + V \u03c8, \u03c8 .\nH=\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n(142)\nFor any \u03b2 6= 0, this is a regular Hamiltonian and equations of motion may be\nwritten in the usual canonical form:\n\u2202H\nd\u03c8 a\n,\n= {\u03c8 a , H} =\ndt\n\u2202\u03c0a\n\nd\u03c0a\n\u2202H\n= {\u03c0a , H} = \u2212 a ,\ndt\n\u2202\u03c8\n\n(143)\n\nor in the equivalent form of complex-conjugate quantities:\nn a o\nd\u03c8\n\u2202H\n,\n= \u03c8 ,H =\ndt\n\u2202\u03c0 a\na\n\n\u2202H\nd\u03c0 a\n= {\u03c0 a , H} = \u2212 a .\ndt\n\u2202\u03c8\n\n(144)\n\nThere are no phase-space constraints and no Lagrange multipliers.\nThe limit transition \u03b2 \u2192 0 is a rather complicated and obscure problem. The\nequations of motion (128), (129) transform then smoothly into (125), (126).\nObviously, this concerns the very form of equations, but the phase portraits\nchange catastrophically as it is usually the case when the highest-order derivative\nterms in equations are neglected. The energy expression (140) also reduces\n26\n\n\fsmoothly to (113). But it is no longer the case with the Hamiltonian (142).\nThere is no directly well-defined limit when \u03b2 in (142) tends to zero. In any\ncase nothing like (81), (82), (114) appears. This is due to the fact that for\n\u03b2 = 0 the Legendre transformation is not invertible. For \u03b2 6= 0 the number of\ncomplex degrees of freedom remains n, i.e., that of real ones remains 2n. But\nfor the vanishing \u03b2, the number of effective real degrees of freedom becomes n.\nThis qualitative discontinuity resembles similar phenomena in field theory, e.g.,\npassing over from the non-vanishing mass of \"photons\" in the Proca equations\nto the vanishing one in the Maxwell ones.\nIn this sense the non-vanishing \u03b2 leads to some \"regularization\" of the underlying Hamilton mechanics, but it is not yet clear how this regularization\ninterferes with the probabilistic interpretation, the structure of the effective\nscalar product of \"wave functions\" and its positive definiteness. This resembles\nthe corresponding problem for the Klein-Gordon equation.\n\n2\n\nNon-direct nonlinearity and Hamiltonian systems on manifolds of second-order tensors\n\nThe mentioned above models of nonlinearity in a finite-level Schr\u00f6dinger equation or second-order \"Schr\u00f6dinger equation\" were \"direct\" in the sense that the\nterm of Lagrangian responsible for nonlinear phenomena was a kind of perturbation extra introduced as an additive correction to the linear background. There\nis a rather large freedom of a priori admissible models and no very convincing\ncriteria of choice do exist. The choice is indeed a matter of intuition and is based\non a kind of phenomenology. And because of this it is never very convincing.\nBelow we try to discuss some models where nonlinearity is not introduced\n\"by hand\", but rather it is based on some kind of geometric aprioric arguments.\n\n2.1\n\nRemoving absolute objects and admitting dynamical\nscalar product\n\nQualitatively, the idea is as follows: Lagrangians (26), (35), (36), (46), (47)\ncontain only one dynamical quantity \u03c8 with n complex degrees of freedom, i.e.,\n2n real ones (x, y). As we saw, it is convenient to follow the method popularly\na\nused in field theory and consider formally the components \u03c8 a and their \u03c8 as\nindependent variables. But all the mentioned Lagrangians contain also some\nabsolute (non-dynamical) object, namely, the scalar product \u0393. It is fixed once\nfor all, just like the metric tensor of Euclidean space or that of Minkowskian\nspace-time of special relativity. And it is just here some doubts appear. Namely,\nNature does not like absolute objects.\nIt turned out that in general relativity the metric tensor of our four-dimensional\n(in general curved) space-time is a dynamical quantity which together with\n\"physical\" or \"matter\" fields satisfies a closed system of differential equations.\n27\n\n\fThis system is based on the mutual interaction and the metric tensor turns out\nto be also some kind of a physical field, namely, it just describes relativistic\ngravitation. Hence, there are no absolute objects in space-time.\nOne can ask why not to follow this pattern and admit \u0393 to be a dynamical\nobject mutually interacting with \u03c8. For what would be the physical reality hidden\nbehind some absolutely fixed \u0393?\nIt turns out that the only natural Lagrangian dynamics of the \u0393-object is\nstrongly nonlinear and this introduces a kind of effective nonlinearity to the\ndynamics of the total (\u0393, \u03c8)-system. This nonlinearity has geometric origin,\ntherefore, it is well motivated and non-perturbative. By that we mean that it\nis not a correction to any well-defined linear background and because of this\nit cannot be analysed by standard techniques of the perturbation calculus, any\nexpansion with respect to some \"small\" parameter, etc.\nAnalytically \u0393 is represented by the quadratic matrix with coefficients \u0393ab .\n\u2217\nGeometrically it is a Hermitian element of the tensor space W \u2297 W \u2217 , i.e., a\nHermitian form on W . In various problems of analytical mechanics and mathematical physics one often deals with dynamical systems the phase spaces of\nwhich are byproducts of some matrix manifolds. Obviously, those matrices appear on the level of calculus and analytical representation but as a matter of\nfact they represent various second-order tensors, i.e., linear mappings operating\nbetween two linear spaces. In applications which present interest for us they\nare usually isomorphisms between linear spaces of the same dimension, i.e., we\ndeal with quadratic non-singular matrices. Some exceptional models when one\ndeals with rectangular (not necessary quadratic) matrices are presented in [25].\n2.1.1\n\nManifolds of linear mappings\n\nLet us begin with some introductory remarks. Matrices provide analytical description of linear mappings. So, let U , V be some linear spaces of the same\ndimension. At a moment, we do not precise if they are meant over the real of\ncomplex field. Let L(U, V ) denote the linear space of all linear mappings of U\ninto V and let LI(U, V ) \u2282 L(U, V ) denote its open submanifold consisting of\nlinear isomorphisms of U onto V . When dealing with analytical formulae, we\nshall use some bases (. . . , EA , . . .), (. . . , ei , . . .) respectively in U and V . Linear\nmappings \u03c6 \u2208 L(U, V ) are analytically represented by matrices with coefficients\n\u03c6i A meant in the following convention:\n\u03c6EA = ei \u03c6i A .\n\n(145)\n\nThe conjugate mappings \u03c6\u2217 : V \u2217 \u2192 U \u2217 is given by\n\u03c6\u2217 p = p \u25e6 \u03c6,\n\u03c6\u2217 ei = \u03c6i A E A ,\n(146)\n\u0001\n\u0001\nwhere . . . , E A , . . . , . . . , ei , . . . denote as usually the dual bases of dual spaces\nU \u2217, V \u2217:\nE A (EB ) = E A , EB = \u03b4 A B ,\n28\n\nei (ej ) = ei , ej = \u03b4 i j .\n\n(147)\n\n\fAnd as usual we make use of abbreviations:\nL(U ) := L(U, U ),\nGL(U ) := LI(U, U ),\n\nL(V ) := L(V, V ),\netc.\nGL(V ) := LI(V, V ),\netc.\n\n(148)\n(149)\n\nObviously, L(U ), L(V ) are associative algebras and at the same time commutator Lie algebras. They are of course canonically identical with Lie algebras of\nthe corresponding Lie groups GL+ (U ), GL+ (V ), i.e., the connected components\nof GL(U ), GL(V ).\nIn applications we often deal with various closed submanifolds of L(U, V ),\nusually distinguished by some additional structures in U , V like, e.g., scalar\nproducts. First of all, let us stress that the groups GL(U ), GL(V ) act in a\nnatural way on LI(U, V ), respectively on the right and on the left. So, for any\nA \u2208 GL(V ), B \u2208 GL(U ) we have the action:\nLI(U, V ) \u220b \u03c6 \u2192 A\u03c6B = (LA \u25e6 RB ) (\u03c6) = (RB \u25e6 LA ) (\u03c6),\n\n(150)\n\nwhere the symbols LA , RB refer respectively to the left- and right-hand-side\nactions. Obviously, both LGL(V ) , RGL(U) act effectively and freely on LI(U, V ).\nHowever, it is important that GL(V ) \u00d7 GL(U ) does not act effectively through\nLGL(V ) RGL(U) , because dilatations in GL(V ) and GL(U ) act in the same way\non LI(U, V ) and the kernel of non-effectiveness of GL(V ) \u00d7 GL(U ) in the action\nthrough (150) is given by the subgroup\n\u0001\n\b\n(151)\n\u03bbIdV , \u03bb\u22121 IdU : \u03bb \u2208 R\\{0} .\n\nLet us mention that L(U ), L(V ) are also semigroups under the composition\nof mappings and these semigroups act on the total L(U, V ) according to the\nformula (150). Obviously, if A, B are not isomorphisms, i.e., elements of GL(V ),\nGL(U ), the submanifold LI(U, V ) is not preserved by them. If linear spaces\nU , V are endowed with some scalar products, i.e., symmetric (usually nondegenerate) bilinear forms, \u03b7 \u2208 U \u2217 \u2297 U \u2217 , g \u2208 V \u2217 \u2297 V \u2217 , then the special attention\nis paid to submanifolds of \"isometries\" O(U, \u03b7; V, g) \u2282 LI(U, V ), consisting of\nsuch mappings \u03c6 \u2208 LI(U, V ) that\ng = \u03c6\u2217 \u03b7,\n\ngij = \u03b7AB \u03c6A i \u03c6B j .\n\n(152)\n\nThey are homogeneous spaces of isometry groups O(V, g), O(U, \u03b7) acting in the\nsense of (150). These isometry groups consist of transformations preserving\nrespectively g and \u03b7,\ng = A\u2217 g,\n\u03b7 = B \u2217 \u03b7,\n(153)\ni.e., analytically,\ngij = gkl Ak i Al j ,\n\n\u03b7KL = \u03b7MN B M K B N L .\n\n(154)\n\nIn such applications we usually deal with real linear spaces and symmetric positively definite metrics. Nevertheless, everything works well at this stage also\n29\n\n\ffor general tensors \u03b7, g, even without any kind of symmetry, or, in the extreme\ncase, when \u03b7, g are skew-symmetric, i.e., if one deals with symplectic structures\nin U , V . Another interesting case is when one considers as relevant submanifolds of LI(U, V ) the orbits of the subgroups U(V ) \u00d7 U(U ), SL(V ) \u00d7 SL(U )\nacting through (150). Here U(V ), U(U ) and SL(V ), SL(U ) denote respectively\nthe unimodular and special linear subgroups of GL(V ), GL(U ), i.e., groups consisting of linear mappings the determinants of which respectively have modulus\none or are just themselves equal to one. If U , V are real linear spaces, then\nU(V ), U(U ) preserve the volumes, i.e., the Lebesgue measures in V , U (it does\nnot matter how normalised), and SL(V ), SL(U ) preserve both the volumes and\norientations (both standards of orientation separately). The manifold LI(U, V )\nis then foliated into orbits which are homogeneous spaces of the mentioned subgroup acting through (150). In the case of real spaces the strata of the action of\nunimodular groups have two connected components corresponding to the fate\nof orientation under the group action.\n2.1.2\n\nHermitian metrics and unitary mappings\n\nIf linear spaces U , V are complex, then in applications we are interested rather\nin sesquilinear Hermitian products \u03b7, g than in bilinear ones. The orthogonal\ngroups are then replaced by the unitary ones U(U, \u03b7), U(V, g). They consist of\ntransformations A \u2208 U(V, g) \u2282 GL(V ), B \u2208 U(U, \u03b7) \u2282 GL(U ) satisfying (153)\nin the analytical form:\nk\n\ngij = gkl A i Al j ,\n\n\u03b7KL = \u03b7M N B\n\n\u2217\n\nM\n\nKB\n\nN\n\nL.\n\n(155)\n\n\u2217\n\nThe Hermitian metrics g \u2208 V \u2297 V \u2217 , \u03b7 \u2208 U \u2297 U \u2217 give rise to the manifold of\nunitary isometries U(U, \u03b7; V, g); it consists of linear mappings relating \u03b7 to g,\n\u03b7 = \u03c6\u2217 g,\n\n\u03b7AB = gij \u03c6i A \u03c6j B .\n\n(156)\n\nObviously, the subset U(U, \u03b7; V, g) is a homogeneous space of both U(V, g),\nU(U, \u03b7) acting through (150). In applications we are interested in, one deals\nusually with Hermitian positively definite metrics \u03b7, g, but some general statements are valid without this restriction, i.e., pseudo-unitary groups are formally\nadmissible. Similarly, if U , V are real linear spaces, then usually \u03b7, g are symmetric positively definite forms. It is so in mechanics of affinely-rigid bodies\ninvestigated by us and others in various papers [5, 6, 7, 16, 24, 32, 33, 34, 35]\n(then U , V are translation spaces respectively in the material and physical affine\nspaces).\n\n2.2\n\nNon-holonomic velocities and invariants\n\nLet Q \u2282 LI(U, V ) be a submanifold used as a configuration space of some\n\"analytical mechanics\". If U , V are complex, then Q may (however need not\n\n30\n\n\fto) be analytic. Moreover, in applications we have in mind, it usually is nonanalytic. \"Motions\" are described by curves\nR \u220b t \u2192 \u03c6(t) \u2208 Q \u2282 LI(U, V ).\n\n(157)\n\nBoth from the point of view of geometrical foundations and practical calculations, it is often convenient to use non-holonomic velocities which at the time\ninstant t \u2208 R are given by\n\u03a9(t)\n\n:=\n\nb\n\u03a9(t)\n\n:=\n\nd\u03c6\n(t)\u03c6\u22121 (t) \u2208 L(V ),\ndt\nd\u03c6\n\u03c6\u22121 (t) (t) = \u03c6\u22121 (t)\u03a9(t)\u03c6(t) \u2208 L(U ),\ndt\n\n(158)\n(159)\n\ni.e., analytically,\n\n\u03a9i j =\n\nd\u03c6i A \u22121A\n\u03c6\nj,\ndt\n\ni\n\nb A B = \u03c6\u22121A i d\u03c6 B .\n\u03a9\ndt\n\n(160)\n\nIf the manifold Q \u2282 LI(U, V ) is parameterized by generalized coordinates q \u03bc ,\n\u03bc = 1, . . . , dim Q, then obviously\n\u03a9i j (q, q\u0307) = \u03a9i j\u03bc (q)\nwhere\n\u03a9i j\u03bc =\n\ndq \u03bc\n,\ndt\n\n\u2202\u03c6i A \u22121A\n\u03c6\nj,\n\u2202q \u03bc\n\n\u03bc\n\nb A B (q, q\u0307) = \u03a9\nb A B\u03bc (q) dq ,\n\u03a9\ndt\n\n(161)\n\ni\n\nb A B\u03bc = \u03c6\u22121A i \u2202\u03c6 B .\n\u03a9\n\u2202q \u03bc\n\n(162)\n\nb instead of the generalized velocities\nThe advantage of using the quantities \u03a9, \u03a9\nq\u0307 \u03bc is that due to their tensorial structure one can construct of them some scalar\ninvariants:\n\u0010 \u0011\nbp ,\np = 1, . . . , dim V ;\n(163)\nIp := Tr (\u03a9p ) = Tr \u03a9\n\naccording to the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, taking other values of p one does\nnot obtain anything new, just some functions of (163). Obviously, the most\n2\nimportant are expressions quadratic in velocities, i.e., I2 and (I1 ) , because in\nanalytical mechanics they are used for constructing kinetic energy models (I2 is\nthe main term and I1 is a merely correction). Even for some non-quadratic (in\nvelocities) hypothetical models of the kinetic energy T , the quantities Ip , first\n2\nof all I2 and (I1 ) , are reasonable modules for constructing T in a form, e.g.,\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(164)\nT = f I2 , (I1 )2 ,\n\nwhere f is some appropriately postulated function of two variables (incidentally,\nlet us mention that in the three-dimensional spatial formulation of relativistic\nmechanics of the material point the kinetic Lagrangian is an irrational function\nof the squared absolute value of velocity).\n\n31\n\n\f2.2.1\n\nKinetic energies, i.e., Riemannian metrics on manifolds of linear mappings. High-symmetry models\n\nQuadratic forms of velocities tangent to Q \u2282 LI(U, V ) are geometrically equivalent to some metric tensors on Q. Usually, at least in our problems, Q is\nsomehow special from the point of view of geometry of LI(U, V ) and the most\nnatural metrics on Q (viable models of kinetic energy) are restrictions to Q of\ngeometrically distinguished metric tensors on the total LI(U, V ). And this is\nwhere we must begin with some digression concerning our former work on analytical mechanics of affinely-rigid bodies, because some ideas developed there\nseem to be an inspiration for our search of geometric Schr\u00f6dinger nonlinear\nmodels. Let us remind that if U , V are real linear spaces of material and spatial translations respectively, then the usual formula for the kinetic energy of\ninternal (relative) degrees of freedom reads [32, 33]\nT =\n\n1 d\u03c6i A d\u03c6j B AB\ngij\nJ ,\n2\ndt\ndt\n\n(165)\n\nwhere g \u2208 V \u2217 \u2297 V \u2217 is the metric tensor of the physical space and J \u2208 U \u2297\nU is, roughly speaking, the constant co-moving tensor of inertia (the secondorder tensor moment of the mass distribution with respect to the Lagrange\ncoordinates). This expression\nunder (150), where A, B are confined\n\u0010 is invariant\n\u0011\nrespectively to O(V, g), O U, Je . In the special case of inertially isotropic\naffine body, when Je is proportional to the reference material metric \u03b7e in the\ncontravariant reciprocal form, thus,\nJ AB = I\u03b7 AB ,\n\nJeAC J CB = \u03b4A B ,\n\n(166)\n\nthe expression (165) is isotropic both spatially and materially. If \u03c6 is an isometry, i.e., \u03c6 \u2208 O (U, \u03b7e; V, g), then (165) becomes the usual kinetic energy of\nthe metrically-rigid body (gyroscope) and the resulting metric tensor is just\nthe restriction of the metric underlying (165) in LI(U, V ) to the submanifold of\nisometries. Just as the latter one, the metric of (165) is not invariant under the\ntotal group (150). And it is just here where the quasivelocities (158)\u2013(160) become interesting. Namely, they transform under (150) according to the following\nrule:\nb \u2192 B \u22121 \u03a9B.\nb\n\u03a9 \u2192 A\u03a9A\u22121 ,\n\u03a9\n(167)\n\nBecause of this, the corresponding quantities Ip (163) are invariant under the\ntotal (150), i.e., under the most natural group underlying geometry of degrees\nof freedom. Therefore, the corresponding kinetic Lagrangians built of Ip , in\n2\nparticular the quadratic ones built of I2 and (I1 ) , and their underlying metric\ntensors are also affinely invariant, i.e., non-sensible to the action of (150). The\nunderlying metric tensors on LI(U, V ) are essentially Riemannian (they have\nnon-vanishing Riemann tensors). This curvature is due to the fact that in ex2\npression for T given by combinations of I2 and (I1 ) with constant coefficients,\nthe corresponding quadratic forms of generalized velocities d\u03c6i A /dt have irreducibly \u03c6-dependent coefficients. And no change of generalized coordinates for\n32\n\n\fsome new ones q \u03bc may help here. The corresponding quadratic forms of q\u0307 \u03bc will\nb are essentially\nhave always q-dependent coefficients. The reason is that \u03a9, \u03a9\nnon-holonomic quantities and this in turn follows from the non-commutativity\nof linear groups GL(V ), GL(U ).\nProposition: As mentioned, from the point of view of geometric a priori, the\nmost natural models of kinetic energies have the following form:\nT =\n\n\u0001 B\nA\nA \u0010 b 2 \u0011 B \u0010 b \u00112\n2\n+\nTr \u03a92 + (Tr \u03a9) = Tr \u03a9\nTr \u03a9 .\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\n(168)\n\nThis expression and the underlying metric tensor on LI(U, V ) are invariant under\nthe total (150). And this is the most general metric of this property. This is an\naffine counterpart for the kinetic energy of the spherical metrically-rigid body.\nProposition: Of course, in principle, just like in mentioned rigid body mechanics, one can think about models affinely invariant in space or ones affinely\ninvariant in the material of the body. As in [32, 33] they are respectively given\nby\nT\n\n=\n\nT\n\n=\n\n1 B D bA bC\nL A C \u03a9 B\u03a9 D,\n2\n1 j l i k\nR i k\u03a9 j \u03a9 l,\n2\n\n(169)\n(170)\n\nobviously with constant coefficients L, R.\nRemark: The only situation of (169) and (170) to coincide, i.e., of the invariance under the total (150), is just (168), the geometrically most natural\nsituation. One\n\u0001 should stress that (168) is not positively definite, its main term\n(A/2) Tr \u03a92 has the signature (n(n + 1)/2 +, n(n \u2212 1)/2 \u2212), so, if gyroscopic\nconstraints are taken into account, A must be negative. It was shown in our\nearlier papers on affine bodies that the non-definiteness of (168) may be just\nconvenient in certain models of elastic vibrations; in those models the dynamics of deformative motion is encoded in the kinetic energy term, i.e., in some\nkind of the effective metric on LI(U, V ). This resembles in a sense the idea of\nMaupertuis principle.\nObviously, in certain phenomenological models of deformative dynamics and\nthe rotation-deformation coupling it may be reasonable to try to mix (168) (or\n(169) and (170)) with the metrical term (165), especially with its isotropic form\n(166).\nProposition: In certain problems it may be perhaps reasonable to postulate\nthe affine model (168) perturbed by two corrections breaking the background\naffine symmetry to the orthogonal one, both in (V, g) and (U, \u03b7), e.g., [32, 33]\nT\n\n=\n=\n\nI1\ngik g jl \u03a9i j \u03a9k l +\n2\nI1\ngik g jl \u03a9i j \u03a9k l +\n2\n\n\u0001\nI2\nb L N + A Tr \u03a92 + B (Tr \u03a9)2 (171)\nbKM \u03a9\n\u03b7KL \u03b7 MN \u03a9\n2\n2\n2\n\u00112\n\u0010 \u0011 B\u0010\nA\nI2\nL\nMN b K\n2\nb .\nb N + Tr \u03a9\nb +\nTr \u03a9\n\u03b7KL \u03b7\n\u03a9 M\u03a9\n2\n2\n2\n\nIf we use orthonormal coordinates in which gik =\u2217 \u03b4ik , \u03b7AB =\u2217 \u03b4AB , then\n33\n\n\fthe following simple formula based on the Rn -object may be used for (171):\nT\n\n=\n=\n\n\u0001\nI1\nTr \u03a9T \u03a9 +\n2\n\u0001\nI1\nTr \u03a9T \u03a9 +\n2\n\nI2 \u0010 b T b \u0011\nTr \u03a9 \u03a9 +\n2\nI2 \u0010 b T b \u0011\nTr \u03a9 \u03a9 +\n2\n\n\u0001 B\nA\nTr \u03a92 + (Tr \u03a9)2\n2\n2\nA \u0010 b 2 \u0011 B \u0010 b \u00112\nTr \u03a9 . (172)\nTr \u03a9 +\n2\n2\n\nRemark: Let us stress the following important circumstance. Unlike (171),\n(172), the expression (168) does not preassume any fixed metrics in U , V . This\nwill be just the pattern to be followed in our model of \"non-direct\" geometric nonlinearity in dynamical systems motivated by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\nThere we deal, of course, with complex linear spaces. The above formulae,\nalthough providing some guiding hints, cannot be literally used because the\ncorresponding Lagrangians would be either trivial or complex. Neither their\nreal nor imaginary parts\nRe T =\n\n\u0001\n1\nT +T ,\n2\n\nIm T =\n\n\u0001\n1\nT \u2212T\n2i\n\n(173)\n\nwould be useful; they do not correspond to any expressions interpretable in\nquantum-mechanical terms.\nAs yet, the linear spaces U , V were assumed completely unrelated to each\nother. And it was just correct in the mentioned applications to elastodynamics.\nLet us remind that L(U ), L(V ) are canonically isomorphic with the commutatorsense Lie algebras of GL(U ), GL(V ) and the expressions (163) were their Casimir\ninvariants; in particular, the appropriate special case of (168), i.e.,\nA = 2n,\n\nB = \u22122,\n\n(174)\n\ncorresponds to the Killing metric (degenerate on the total L(U ), L(V ) because\nthose algebras are not semisimple; dilatations form the normal subgroups of\nGL(U ), GL(V )). In the mentioned elastodynamical applications we often deal\nwith the situation where the configuration space Q \u2282 LI (U, V ) is an orbit of\nsome subgroups GU \u2282 GL(U ), GV \u2282 GL(V ) acting through (150). Those\nsubgroups are isomorphic and for any \u03c6 \u2208 Q we have that\nGU = \u03c6\u22121 GV \u03c6,\n\nGV = \u03c6GU \u03c6\u22121 .\n\n(175)\n\nRemark: The usual, i.e., metrically-rigid, body is a typical example, we have\nthen\nGU = O (U, \u03b7) ,\nGV = O (V, g) ,\n\u03c6 \u2208 O (U, \u03b7; V, g) .\n(176)\nMore precisely, in some realistic mechanical applications we are dealing then\nwith the connected components O+ (U, \u03b7) = SO (U, \u03b7), O+ (V, g) = SO (V, g)\nand their orbits. Similarly, one considers orbits of SL(U ), SL(V ) (incompressible\nbody), etc. Restricting the expressions (163) to Lie subalgebras G\u2032U \u2282 L(U ),\nG\u2032V \u2282 L(V ) one obtains some Casimir invariants; usually they need not be\nindependent. For example, for SO (U, \u03b7), SO (V, g) we have Ip = 0 for any odd\np.\n34\n\n\fBefore going any further we must discuss some special situations. As mentioned, the linear spaces U , V above where independent on each other. The\ncorresponding configuration spaces consisted of linear mappings \u03c6 \u2208 L(U, V ),\ni.e., of tensor quantities \u03c6 \u2208 V \u2297 U \u2217 ; they were analytically represented by matrices \u03c6i A (doubled quantities in the Schouten-Veblen language). But when discussing Hamiltonian systems inspired by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, we must use\nmatrices which analytically represent some scalar products, i.e., twice covariant\n\u2217\ntensors in W , more precisely, the sesquilinear Hermitian forms \u0393 \u2208 W \u2297 W \u2217\nrepresented analytically by matrices [\u0393ab ] (in realistic applications positively\ndefinite ones). Some relatively new structures appear then.\n2.2.2\n\nMetrics on groups as the special case\n\nBefore discussing the manifolds of scalar products and the aforementioned structures, it is instructive to start, for comparison and for preparing the proper\nmathematical instruments, with the situation U = V . Then LI(U, V ) becomes\nsimply the linear group GL(V ) = GL(U ) and the resulting scheme is that of\n(more or less) invariant Hamiltonian systems on the total Lie groups or their\nsubgroups with some interplay of left and right invariance. Configuration space\nconsists of non-degenerate mixed second-order tensors (once contravariant and\nonce covariant) in a given linear space. The corresponding metric tensors underlying the kinetic energy expressions like (169), (170) and their special cases like\n(168), (171) have respectively the following explicitly non-Euclidean (if n > 1)\nforms:\nG\nG\nG\n\nG\n\n= Lj n l m \u03c6\u22121n i \u03c6\u22121m k d\u03c6i j \u2297 d\u03c6k l ,\n= \u03c6\u22121j n \u03c6\u22121l m Rn i m k d\u03c6i j \u2297 d\u03c6k l ,\n\u0001\n= A\u03c6\u22121l i \u03c6\u22121j k + B\u03c6\u22121j i \u03c6\u22121l k d\u03c6i j \u2297 d\u03c6k l ,\n\u22121j\n\n\u22121l\n\nmn\n\ni\n\nk\n\n\u22121m\n\n= I1 \u03c6 m \u03c6 n g gik d\u03c6 j \u2297 d\u03c6 l + I2 gmn \u03c6\n\u0001\n+ A\u03c6\u22121l i \u03c6\u22121j k + B\u03c6\u22121j i \u03c6\u22121l k d\u03c6i j \u2297 d\u03c6k l .\n\n(177)\n(178)\n(179)\n\u22121n\n\ni\u03c6\n\nkg\n\njl\n\ni\n\nd\u03c6 j \u2297 d\u03c6k l\n(180)\n\nSimilar expansions with respect to the basic terms d\u03c6i A \u2297 d\u03c6j B may be done\nin general, e.g., for (171) when U , V may be different linear spaces. The corresponding formulae are structurally like the above ones. The explicit expressions\nlike (177)\u2013(180) are in spite of their rather technical nature interesting in themselves and give an alternative analytical insight into the structure of expressions.\nThe restriction of the above metrics/kinetic energies to submanifolds of\nGL(V ) is analytically achieved by specifying \u03c6i j as functions of some parameters, i.e., generalized coordinates q \u03bc , \u03bc = 1, . . . , f . Technically this implies that\nthe differentials d\u03c6i j are specified as\nd\u03c6i j =\n\n\u2202\u03c6i j \u03bc\ndq .\n\u2202q \u03bc\n\n(181)\n\nIn applications the mentioned submanifolds of GL(V ) are usually its subgroups,\ne.g., special orthogonal SO(V, g), special linear SL(V ), etc. In formulae one uses\n35\n\n\fLie algebras of the mentioned subgroups as geometrically and technically convenient non-holonomic velocities. Usually the choice of some particular models of T , i.e., of G, is motivated by the particular symmetry demands under\nleft and right regular translations in GL(V ) or in the corresponding subgroup\nG \u2282 GL(V ). The highest symmetry corresponds to (179).\n2.2.3\n\nManifolds of scalar products and their non-holonomic velocities\n\nLet us now consider another pair of mutually related spaces, namely, the dual\npair; V = U \u2217 , U = V \u2217 . Linear mappings from V to V \u2217 are twice covariant\ntensors \u03b1, i.e., elements of V \u2217 \u2297 V \u2217 \u2243 L (V, V \u2217 ), represented by matrices \u03b1ij .\nSimilarly, linear mappings from V \u2217 to V are twice contravariant tensors \u03b2, i.e.,\nelements of V \u2297 V \u2243 L (V \u2217 , V ), analytically represented by matrices \u03b2 ij . In\nthe case of isomorphisms there exists a natural canonical bijection of LI (V, V \u2217 )\nonto LI (V \u2217 , V ); namely, according to the standard rules, interrelated are objects\n\u03b1 \u2208 V \u2217 \u2297 V \u2217 , \u03b2 \u2208 V \u2297 V such that\n\u03b1ik \u03b2 kj = \u03b4i j ,\n\n\u03b2 ik \u03b1kj = \u03b4 i j .\n\n(182)\n\n\u03b1 = \u03b2 \u22121 .\n\n(183)\n\nOne can write simply\n\u03b2 = \u03b1\u22121 ,\n\nJust as when dealing with geodetic Hamiltonian systems on GL(V ), one considers now again the very special case of LI(U, V ), however, with completely new\nphysical and geometrical peculiarities.\nFor any time evolutions\nR \u220b t 7\u2192 \u03b1(t) \u2208 LI (V, V \u2217 ) ,\n\nR \u220b t 7\u2192 \u03b2(t) \u2208 LI (V \u2217 , V )\n\n(184)\n\nb\nthe \u03a9, \u03a9-objects\nare as well defined as for any general R \u220b t 7\u2192 \u03c6(t) \u2208 LI (U, V ).\nHowever, certain new features and peculiarities appear. The corresponding\nobjects for curves in LI (V, V \u2217 ) are denoted by \u03a9[\u03b1] \u2208 L (V \u2217 ) \u2243 V \u2217 \u2297 V and\nb\nb (\u03b1, \u03b1\u0307).\n\u03a9[\u03b1]\n\u2208 L (V ) \u2243 V \u2297 V \u2217 ; more explicitly one can write them as \u03a9 (\u03b1, \u03b1\u0307), \u03a9\nAnalytically they are given by\nb i j = \u03b1\u22121ik \u03b1\u0307kj .\n\u03a9[\u03b1]\n\n\u03a9[\u03b1]i j = \u03b1\u0307ik \u03b1\u22121kj ,\n\n(185)\n\nObviously, they are interrelated by the following formulae:\n\u03a9[\u03b1]i j\nb ij\n\u03a9[\u03b1]\n\nb k l \u03b1\u22121lj ,\n= \u03b1ik \u03a9[\u03b1]\n\u22121ik\n\n= \u03b1\n\nl\n\n\u03a9[\u03b1]k \u03b1lj ,\n\n\u22121\nb\n\u03a9[\u03b1] = \u03b1\u03a9[\u03b1]\u03b1\n,\n\u22121\nb\n\u03a9[\u03b1] = \u03b1 \u03a9[\u03b1]\u03b1.\n\n(186)\n(187)\n\nSimilarly, for curves in LI (V \u2217 , \u0010\nV ) we\u0011 use\u0010the symbols\n\u03a9[\u03b2] \u2208 L (V ) \u2243 V \u2297 V \u2217 ,\n\u0011\nb\nb \u03b2, \u03b2\u0307 .

In particular, one can consider the rigid motion in\nb\nthe sense of those metrics; the \u03a9, \u03a9-objects\nbecome then skew-symmetric with\nrespect to introduced metrics, i.e., are interpretable as \"angular velocities\".\nObviously, when dealing with the manifold of scalar products in V , it would be\nrather artificial and exotic to introduce two independent metrics in V and V \u2217\n(as we did in mechanics of affine bodies in LI (U, V )); rather some metric in V\nand its contravariant inverse in V \u2217 would be used.\nRemark: One point is important here. In mechanical theory of systems with\naffine degrees of freedom, in LI (U, V ), GL (V ) as configuration spaces, it was\nrather natural to discuss constrained motion along subgroups of GL (V ) or some\norbits of the left or right actions of subgroups of GL (V ), GL (U ) on LI (U, V ).\nNonholonomic velocities were then the elements of the corresponding Lie subalgebras. And one concentrated on the left or right (or both) invariant metrics\n(kinetic energies) on configuration submanifolds. Nothing like this is useful in\napplications of dynamical systems on the manifold of scalar products. For bilinear forms, i.e., elements of V \u2217 \u2297 V \u2217 or V \u2297 V , the symmetry/antisymmetry\nis well defined without any reference to something like a once fixed absolute\nscalar product. Usually we deal with symmetric or antisymmetric scalar products, e.g., if V is over reals, with (pseudo-)Euclidean spaces or (generally) with\nsymplectic spaces. When V is over the complex field C, the special stress is\nlaid on Hermitian scalar products. Obviously, being twice covariant (or twice\ncontravariant) tensors, not mixed ones, such objects cannot be multiplied in\nspite of their analytical matrix form. Even if we identify V with V \u2217 using some\npre-fixed reference scalar product and so identify the mentioned forms with linear transformations, nothing like the subgroup structure survives because, as a\nrule, the subsets of symmetric, antisymmetric, or Hermitian matrices are not\nb do not form\nclosed under multiplication. And as a rule, the above objects \u03a9, \u03a9\nLie algebras. Nevertheless, they are well-defined mixed tensors in V and enable\none to construct invariant quadratic scalars and, more generally, the family of\nbasic scalars homogeneous in derivatives (generalised velocities) in a complete\nanalogy to Lie-algebraic Casimir invariants (163).\n\n37\n\n\f2.2.4\n\nCanonical Riemann structures, i.e., kinetic energies on manifolds of scalar products. High-symmetry models\n\nSo, we would like to fix now some useful (at least hopefully) models of \"kinetic energy\", i.e., Riemannian structure, on appropriate manifolds of scalar\nproducts. As usual, it is impossible to be at the same time very general and\ncomputationally effective. And as a rule, it is the special cases, first of all the\nones with high symmetry, that has a chance to be physically viable. So, step by\nstep one reduces the interest to (169), (170), later on to (171), (172), then to\n(168) and first of all to its special case B = 0 (it is clear that the square-term\ncontrolled by B is a merely secondary correction).\nExplicitly, the Riemannian structure on the manifold Sym (V \u2217 \u2297 V \u2217 ) \u2282 V \u2217 \u2297\n\u2217\nV of symmetric scalar products on V , constructed by analogy with the GL(V )prescription (168), has the form corresponding to the kinetic energy\nT =\ni.e., analytically to\nT =\n\n\u0001 B\nA\n2\nTr \u03a9[\u03b1]2 + (Tr \u03a9[\u03b1]) ,\n2\n2\n\u00012\nB\nA\n\u03a9[\u03b1]i j \u03a9[\u03b1]j i +\n\u03a9[\u03b1]i i .\n2\n2\n\n(193)\n\n(194)\n\nIn analogy to (179) and using the standard Riemann expressions, we write for\nthe underlying metric tensor that\n\u0001\n(195)\nG = A\u03b1\u22121li \u03b1\u22121jk + B\u03b1\u22121ji \u03b1\u22121lk d\u03b1ij \u2297 d\u03b1kl ,\nnotice however some essential differences between (195) and (179). Using the\nfavourite physicists way of thinking, we have the metric element\n\u0001\n(196)\nds2 = A\u03b1\u22121li \u03b1\u22121jk + B\u03b1\u22121ji \u03b1\u22121lk d\u03b1ij d\u03b1kl ,\nwhere the pairs (ij), (kl) are, roughly speaking, bi-indices; their ordering does\nnot matter when we deal with the manifold Sym (V \u2217 \u2297 V \u2217 ) of symmetric forms\non V .\nIt is clear that when the forms \u03b1 are symmetric, the plenty of \"aesthetic\"\nchanges of ordering of indices is possible. Something similar, although a bit\ndifferent, may be done for manifolds of symplectic forms. Equation (195) may\nbe written in the following form:\nG = G ijkl (\u03b1)d\u03b1ij \u2297 d\u03b1kl ,\n\n(197)\n\nwhere, let us notice carefully,\nG abcd =\n\n\u0001\nA \u22121ac \u22121bd\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n+ \u03b1\u22121bc \u03b1\u22121ad + B\u03b1\u22121ab \u03b1\u22121cd .\n2\n\n(198)\n\nThe above formula implies that G abcd have all necessary symmetry properties to\nrepresent some Riemannian metric on the manifold of real (or complex-analytic)\nsymmetric scalar products,\nG abcd = G bacd = G abdc = G cdab\n38\n\n(199)\n\n\f(strictly speaking, the symmetry under the simultaneous exchange of pair (ab),\n(cd) holds without the representation (198)).\nAlthough not interesting for our purposes here, it is nevertheless interesting\nin itself to search for natural metrics on the manifold of all non-degenerate\nbilinear forms on V , not necessarily symmetric ones. They work as follows\nwhen evaluated on pairs of tangent vectors:\nG abcd uab vcd ,\n\n(200)\n\nwhere\n\u0001\nD \u22121ac \u22121bd\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n+ \u03b1\u22121ca \u03b1\u22121db\n2\n\u0001\nE \u22121ad \u22121bc\n\u22121ad \u22121cb\n+ B\u03b1\n\u03b1\n+\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n+ \u03b1\u22121da \u03b1\u22121cb\n2\n\u0001\nF\n\u22121da \u22121bc\n\u03b1\u22121ca \u03b1\u22121bd + \u03b1\u22121ac \u03b1\u22121db .\n+ G\u03b1\n\u03b1\n+\n2\n\nG abcd\n\n= A\u03b1\u22121ab \u03b1\u22121cd +\n\n(201)\n\nObviously, in an exactly the same way as we did above, we can construct natural\nscalar products on manifolds of non-degenerate twice contravariant tensors, i.e.,\nRiemann structures on Sym (V \u2297 V ).

Analytically, the\ncounterpart of (180) as a metric on Sym (V \u2217 \u2297 V \u2217 ) is given by\nG\n\n=\n+\n\nI1 \u03b1\u22121jm \u03b1\u22121ln Gmn Gik d\u03b1ij \u2297 d\u03b1kl + I2 \u03b1\u22121im \u03b1\u22121kn Gmn Gjl d\u03b1ij \u2297 d\u03b1kl\n\u0001\n(207)\nA\u03b1\u22121li \u03b1\u22121jk + B\u03b1\u22121ji \u03b1\u22121lk d\u03b1ij \u2297 d\u03b1kl ,\n39\n\n\fwhere I1 , I2 , A, B are some constants.\nObviously, G with the upper-case indices is the contravariant inverse of G\nwith the lower-case indices, Gik Gkj = \u03b4 i j . One must be very careful when the\ninverse symbol is omitted for brevity in \u03b1\u22121ij , i.e., when we use the simplified\nnotation \u03b1ij . This is again the inverse,\n\u03b1ik \u03b1kj = \u03b4 i j ,\n\n(208)\n\nhowever, one must remember that it is something else than the G-raising and\nlowering of indices,\n\u03b1ij = \u03b1\u22121ij 6= Gik Gjl \u03b1kl .\n(209)\nIf nothing like some distinguished G is fixed, we can consider only geodetic\nmodels, first of all homogeneous ones, characterized by high symmetries, like\n(193)\u2013(195). If for some physical reasons some certain reference metric G is\nfixed, we have more possibilities. First of all, we can take the model (207) of\nthe kinetic energy and manipulate somehow with the constants I1 , I2 , A, B.\nBut there are also some natural classes of potentials V (\u03b1) and the corresponding\nLagrangians L = T \u2212 V (\u03b1). Namely, having at disposal two \"metrics\" G, \u03b1 \u2208\nSym (V \u2217 \u2297 V \u2217 ) we can construct the mixed tensor \u03b1\nb \u2208 V \u2297 V \u2217 \u2243 L(V ). Then in\nthe n-dimensional space V we can construct the system of n independent basic\nscalars:\nIp (\u03b1, G) := Tr (\u03b1p ) ,\np = 1, . . . , n.\n(210)\nAccording to the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, Ip for any other integer p may be\nexpressed as a function of the above ones; again the property which was used\nin the study of deformation invariants. And the most natural and symmetric\npotentials V are appropriately chosen functions of Ip (\u03b1, G).\nObviously, exactly the same may be done for systems on Sym (V \u2297 V ); there\nis no need to write down the obvious formulae.\n2.2.5\n\nTaking \"translations\" into account. Riemann structures on\nthe manifolds of wave functions times scalar products\n\nLet us also mention another class of canonical Riemannian structures on the\nmanifolds V \u00d7 Sym (V \u2217 \u2297 V \u2217 ). They have the following form:\n\u0001\n(211)\nG = M \u03b1ij dui \u2297 duj + A\u03b1\u22121li \u03b1\u22121jk + B\u03b1\u22121ji \u03b1\u22121lk d\u03b1ij \u2297 d\u03b1kl ,\n\nwhere M , A, B are constants and ui are linear coordinates on V corresponding\nto our choice of basis (therefore, they are simply elements of the dual basis in\nV \u2217 ). Kinetic energy based on (211) is as follows:\nT =\n\n\u0001 B\nA\nM\n2\n\u03b1ij v i v j + Tr \u03a9[\u03b1]2 + (Tr \u03a9[\u03b1]) ,\n2\n2\n2\n\n(212)\n\nwhere v i = dui /dt is the \"translational\" velocity, in analogy to formulae for the\naffinely-rigid body.\n\n40\n\n\fRemark: Let us observe that in the \"translational\" part of T the velocity\nv i is squared with the use of \u03b1 itself, not with the use of some fixed metric\nG \u2208 Sym (V \u2217 \u2297 V \u2217 ). This resembles some models of affine motion, where the\ntranslational velocity is squared with the use of the Cauchy deformation tensor\n[32, 33].\n\n2.3\n\nNatural Lagrangians of high symmetry, dynamical\nequations for scalar products and simple solutions\n\nThose were preliminary remarks based on intuitions developed during our earlier\nstudy of Hamiltonian systems on groups and homogeneous spaces, first of all on\nmanifolds of affine and linear mappings (affinely-rigid bodies). Now we are well\nprepared to return to our proper subject, i.e., to the non-direct nonlinearity of\nhypothetical quantum mechanics.\nLet us go back to the complex linear space W and consider the manifold of\nHermitian scalar products there,\n\u0011 manifold of non-degenerate sesquilin\u0010 \u2217 i.e., the\n\u2217\near Hermitian forms, Herm W \u2297 W . In principle they should be positively\ndefinite, but in many problems this restriction is not formally necessary. Analytically such scalar products \u0393 are represented by Hermitian matrices [\u0393ab ] in\nthe sense that\n\u0001\n\u0393(u, v) = \u0393 ua ea , v b eb = \u0393ab ua v b ,\n(213)\nwhere ea \u2208 W\u0010are some basic\nvectors in W .\n\u0011\n\u2217\n\u2217\nLet Herm W \u2297 W , or rather some its connected component (first of all\nthe one consisting of positive forms), be our configuration\n\u0010 space. \u0011Obviously,\n\u2217\n\nin spite of the complex character of W , the set Herm W \u2297 W \u2217 is a real\nlinear space, and\u0010 the mentioned\nconfiguration space is a real manifold, an open\n\u0011\n\u2217\nsubset of Herm W \u2297 W \u2217 . We are interested in Riemannian structures on\nthis manifold and mainly in ones analogous to (193)\u2013(195) and (202)\u2013(204).\nTo be more precise, those Riemannian structures will be restrictions of some\n\u2217\nHermitian ones defined on the total W \u2297 W \u2217 . We introduce them as some\nkinetic energy forms.\nProposition: Obviously, the only natural counterpart of (193)\u2013(195) is as follows:\nA\nB\nT = \u0393bc \u0393da \u0393\u0307ab \u0393\u0307cd + \u0393ba \u0393dc \u0393\u0307ab \u0393\u0307cd ,\n(214)\n2\n2\nwhere \u0393 with the upper-case indices is\u0001the contravariant inverse of one with the\nlower-case ones, \u0393\u22121 \u2208 Herm W \u2297 W , i.e., analytically,\n\u0393ac \u0393cb = \u03b4 a b ,\n\n\u0393ab \u0393bc = \u03b4a c .\n\n(215)\n\nThe metrics underlying (214) are essentially curved and imply in a strong,\nnon-perturbative nonlinearity. The corresponding action functional will be denoted by\nZ\nI[\u0393] = I[\u0393, m] + I[\u0393, a] =\n41\n\nT dt.\n\n(216)\n\n\fIts terms controlled by constants A, B were here denoted respectively by I[\u0393, m],\nI[\u0393, a]; the labels m and a refer respectively to \"main\" and \"additional\". The\nreason is that evidently the B-term is a merely auxiliary correction and the\nmodel with A = 0 would be meaningless. The A-term is a proper dynamics.\nAfter some calculations one finds the following expressions for variational\nderivatives:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03b4I[\u0393, m]\n= \u2212A\u0393bn \u0393\u0308nk \u2212 \u0393\u0307nl \u0393lc \u0393\u0307ck \u0393ka ,\n(217)\n\u03b4\u0393ab (t)\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03b4I[\u0393, a]\n= \u2212B\u0393ln \u0393\u0308nl \u2212 \u0393\u0307nk \u0393kc \u0393\u0307cl \u0393ba .\n(218)\n\u03b4\u0393ab (t)\nIn analogy to doubly invariant Hamiltonian systems on semisimple Lie groups,\none can show that the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations\n\u03b4I[\u0393]\n=0\n\u03b4\u0393ab (t)\n\n(219)\n\nare solvable in terms of the matrix exponential function\n\u0393rs (t) = Grz exp(Et)z s ,\n\n(220)\n\u0010\n\n\u2217\n\n\u0011\n\nwhere E \u2208 L(W ) \u2243 W \u2297 W \u2217 and G = \u0393(0) \u2208 Herm W \u2297 W \u2217 is the initial\n\u0011\n\u0010 \u2217\nposition in the configuration space Herm W \u2297 W \u2217 . It is clear that (220) is\na solution of (219) for any G and E. One can also easily show that \u0393(t) persists\nto be Hermitian for all t \u2208 R if E is G-Hermitian, i.e., if the sesquilinear form\nG Ers\n\n:= Grz E z s\n\n(221)\n\nis Hermitian.\nThis procedure is equivalent to the following one, based on the multiplication\nby matrix exponents on the left:\n(222)\n\u0393rs (t) = exp(F t)r z Gzs ,\n\u0010 \u2217\u0011\n\u2217\nwhere again G is arbitrary and F \u2208 L W \u2243 W \u2297 W must be G-Hermitian\nif \u0393 is to be Hermitian for any t \u2208 R. In other words, the sesquilinear form\n\u2217\n\nW \u2297 W \u2217 \u220b (FG )rs = Fr z Gzs\n\n(223)\n\nmust be Hermitian.\nIt is seen that, depending on the choice of E or F , \u0393 may be oscillatory,\nexponentially growing or exponentially attenuating. All these situations may\nhave something to do with decoherence, reduction, and other \"paradoxes\" of\nquantum mechanics.\nRemark: We were dealing here with the pure dynamics for the \"scalar product\" \u0393, without any interaction with the \"wave function\" \u03c8. By the way,\n42\n\n\fthe dynamics\n\u0393 was\n\u0010 for\n\u0011 purely amorphous in the sense that no fixed metric\n\u2217\n\u2217\nG \u2208 Herm W \u2297 W\nwas assumed. In principle we might assume some and\nadmit for T [\u0393] something similar to (171), (172), (180). No doubt, such expressions are definitely less convincing from the point of view of first principles of\nsymmetry. On the other side, without using any fixed G, we have at our disposal\nonly the above geodetic models (214) for the pure dynamics of \u0393. When some G\nis distinguished, then just like in (210) we can construct potentials invariantly\nbuilt of some basic invariants of the following form:\n\u0001\nTr G \u0393p ,\np = 1, . . . , n,\n(224)\nwhere\n\nG r\n\n\u0393\n\ns\n\n:= Grz \u0393zs .\n\n(225)\n\nIncidentally, let us mention that instead of I1 , I2 -controlled terms in (171), (172),\n(180) one can try to use some simpler expressions based on the fixed G, just\nquadratic in generalized velocities with constant coefficients, although showing\nweaker symmetries, e.g.,\nK\nI bc da\nG G \u0393\u0307ab \u0393\u0307cd + Gba Gdc \u0393\u0307ab \u0393\u0307cd .\n2\n2\n\n(226)\n\nProposition: After introducing the new dynamical term (214) (perhaps with\nsome mentioned modifications), we must go back to all previous Lagrangians\nfor \u03c8 and modify the corresponding variational derivatives on two levels:\n1. One of subsystems of equations of motion has the following form:\n\u03b4I [\u0393, \u03c8]\n= 0,\n\u03b4\u0393rs (t)\n\n(227)\n\nwhere I is built of the sum of all possible Lagrangians. We have just\ncalculated (217), (218) for I [\u0393]. But we must have (227) just for the total\nI [\u0393, \u03c8] built of the total Lagrangian L [\u0393, \u03c8]. Fortunately, in all previous\nLagrangians \u0393 enters in a purely algebraic way, so the calculations are\nrelatively simple.\n2. For all previous terms one must revise the variational derivatives\n\u03b4I [\u0393, \u03c8]\n= 0,\n\u03b4\u03c8 a\n\n\u03b4I [\u0393, \u03c8]\n\u03b4\u03c8\n\na\n\n=0\n\n(228)\n\ntaking, however, into account that \u0393 is a dynamical quantity and the\noperation d/dt in Euler-Lagrange expressions\nd \u2202L\n\u2202L\n\u2212\n,\na\n\u2202\u03c8\ndt \u2202 \u03c8\u0307 a\n\n\u2202L\n\u2202\u03c8\n\na\n\nintroduces some new terms involving d\u0393/dt.\n43\n\n\u2212\n\nd \u2202L\ndt  \u0307 a\n\u2202\u03c8\n\n(229)\n\n\f2.4\n\nTotal system of essentially nonlinear dynamical equations\n\nLet us review the corresponding equations of motion [18]. They are strongly\nnonlinear in (\u03c8, \u0393) and this nonlinearity is essential and non-perturbative. We\nhave yet neither rigorous nor qualitative solutions, however the above remarks\nconcerning the pure dynamics for \u0393 seem to indicate that this kind of nonlinearity may be an alternative description of the open quantum system for \u03c8 with\nthe surrounding symbolically represented by the dynamical \u0393. The nonlinear\ninteraction with \u0393 might be perhaps a good candidate for explaining the aforementioned \"paradoxes\". This might be perhaps an approach alternative to that\ndeveloped by Ingarden, Jamiolkowski, Kossakowski [13, 14, 15] and others.\nProposition: Let us consider the most general Lagrangian:\n\u0010\n\u0011\nL = \u03b11 i\u0393\u0101b \u03c8 \u0101 \u03c8\u0307 b \u2212 \u03c8 \u0307 \u0101 \u03c8 b + \u03b12 \u0393\u0101b \u03c8 \u0307 \u0101 \u03c8\u0307 b + [\u03b14 \u0393\u0101b + \u03b15 H\u0101b ] \u03c8 \u0101 \u03c8 b\n\u0002\n\u0003\n+ \u03b13 \u0393b\u0101 + \u03b19 \u03c8 \u0101 \u03c8 b \u0393\u0307\u0101b + \u03a9[\u03c8, \u0393]dc\u0304b\u0101 \u0393\u0307\u0101b \u0393\u0307c\u0304d \u2212 V (\u03c8, \u0393) ,\n(230)\n\nwhere\n\n\u03a9[\u03c8, \u0393]dc\u0304b\u0101\n\n=\n+\n\n\u0003\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u03b16 \u0393d\u0101 + \u03b19 \u03c8 \u0101 \u03c8 d \u0393bc\u0304 + \u03b19 \u03c8 c\u0304 \u03c8 b + \u03b18 \u03c8 \u0101 \u03c8 b \u03c8 c\u0304 \u03c8 d\n\u0003\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u03b17 \u0393b\u0101 + \u03b19 \u03c8 \u0101 \u03c8 b \u0393dc\u0304 + \u03b19 \u03c8 c\u0304 \u03c8 d = \u03a9[\u03c8, \u0393]b\u0101dc\u0304 , (231)\n\nand the potential V can be taken, for instance, in the following quartic form:\n\u00012\nV (\u03c8, \u0393) = \u03ba \u0393\u0101b \u03c8 \u0101 \u03c8 b .\n(232)\n\nThe first and second terms in (230) (those with \u03b11 and \u03b12 ) describe the free\nevolution of wave function \u03c8 while \u0393 is fixed.
