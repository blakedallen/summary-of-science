For a recent review see [1], for example. Pure state discrimination has\nproven to be useful for both quantum cryptography and\nfor quantum algorithms [2, 3]. The basic protocol is the\nfollowing. One has a list of possible quantum states, and\none is presented with a system that is guaranteed to be\nin one of them. Our task is to determine which. If the\nstates are not orthogonal, they cannot be discriminated\nperfectly, and it is necessary to specify what kind of strategy we wish to use. One possibility is minimum error\ndiscrimination [4]. In this procedure, we always specify\na state, but, because the states are not orthogonal, there\nis some chance that we will make a mistake. Minimumerror procedures minimize the chance of making a mistake. Another alternative is unambiguous discrimination.\nThis procedure never makes a mistake, but it can sometimes fail. If the list of states contains N possibilities,\nthen this procedure has N + 1 possible outputs, one for\neach of the states on list plus a failure output. If we receive an output that specifies one of the states, then we\nknow what the state of our system was, and if we receive\nthe failure output, then we have no idea what it was. An\noptimum unambiguous procedure is one that minimizes\nthe probability of receiving the failure output. We shall\nbe considering unambiguous discrimination here.\nThe problem of optimal unambiguous discrimination\nbetween two pure quantum states was solved by Ivanovic,\nDieks and Peres [5, 6, 7]. They assumed that each of\nthe two states were equally probable. The case in which\nthey are not was treated by Jaeger and Shimony [8] (for a\nsomewhat simpler derivation of their result see [9]). The\ncase of more than two pure states is not simple and has\nbeen considered by a number of authors. There are a few\ngeneral results, but explicit procedures are available only\n\nfor special cases [10, 11]. One important result is that for\nunambiguous discrimination to be possible, the states on\nthe list must be linearly independent [12]. There are also\nlower bounds on the failure probability [13].\nThe discrimination of two mixed states has only been\nconsidered more recently. Before we cite the previous results it will be useful to introduce some terminology at\nthis point. The support Sj of the density operator \u03c1j ,\ndescribing a quantum state, is the subspace of the entire\nHilbert space H spanned by the eigenvectors of \u03c1j belonging to nonzero eigenvalues (for j = 1, 2). The rank of the\ndensity operator is equal to the dimension of its support.\nThe subspace orthogonal to its support, S\u0304j , is the kernel\nof the density operator \u03c1j such that H = Sj \u2295 S\u0304j . We\nshall denote the projector onto Sj by Pj and the projector onto S\u0304j by P\u0304j . Equipped with these definitions\nwe can now make the following general statement. For\ntwo mixed quantum states unambiguous discrimination\nis possible with a finite probability of success if and only\nif the supports of their density operators are not identical. Indeed, in such a case the kernel of at least one of\nthem is not empty and a projective measurement along\nthis kernel unambiguously identifies the other state. On\nthe other hand, if the supports are identical, then so are\ntheir kernels, and there is no direction in H that could\nunambiguously identify at least one of the density operators.\nWe can now return to a listing of earlier results. The\nPOVM for unambiguously discriminating between a pure\nstate and a rank two mixed state was derived in [14] and\nsubsequently generalized to the case of unambiguously\ndiscriminating a pure state from any mixed state [3].\nLower bounds on the failure probability for the unambiguous discrimination of two mixed states were derived\nby Rudolph et al. [15] and for an arbitrary number of\nmixed states by Feng et al. [16]. Raynal et al. [17] proved\ntwo theorems that make it possible to reduce the problem\nof unambiguously discriminating between two arbitrary\n\n\f2\nmixed states of rank k1 and k2 to the discrimination of\ntwo states of the same rank, k \u2264 min(k1 , k2 ), in a 2kdimensional space. Building on the results of [15] and\n[16], Herzog and Bergou [18] found explicit solutions for\nsome special cases along with necessary conditions for the\nsaturation of the lower bound. In particular, these results\nshowed that unlike in the case of two pure states whether\nor not the lower bound can be attained depends not only\non the value of the prior probabilty of the states but also\non their structure. There are mixed states for which the\nlower bound can not be reached for any value of the prior\nprobability. In [19] the optimal measurement operators\nwere constructed explicitly for some special cases.\nIn this paper we shall consider the unambiguous discrimination between two subspaces. What this means is\nthe following. A state is chosen from one of two subspaces, and we wish to determine to which of the subspaces the state belongs. Within each subspace each\nstate is equally likely, though one subspace may be more\nlikely than the other. One place in which this type\nof problem has arisen is in the consideration of programmable discriminators [20]. In this case, one is given\nthree qubits, the first two are arbitrary but the third is\nguaranteed to be identical to either the first or the second\nqubit, and the problem is to determine which two qubits\nare identical. The problem can be solved by realizing that\none is, in fact, discriminating between two subspaces, the\nfirst being the subspace of three-qubit states that is symmetric in the first and third qubits, and the second being\nthe subspace that is symmetric in the second and third\nqubits.\nSubspace discrimination is a special case of the discrimination of two mixed states; in this case the density\nmatrices are just proportional to the projection operators\nonto the subspaces. Making use of the results of Raynal\net al. [17], we can restrict our attention to the case of\ntwo subspaces of dimension k in a 2k dimensional space.\nIn particular, let S1 , and S2 be k-dimensional subspaces\nof the entire Hilbert space, H, which has dimension 2k.\nWe can assume that the intersection of S1 and S2 is just\nthe zero vector, a situation which we henceforth refer to\nas general position. We assume that \u03c11 = (1/k)P1 occurs with probability \u03b7, and \u03c12 = (1/k)P2 occurs with\nprobability 1 \u2212 \u03b7, where Pj is the projection onto Sj , for\nj = 1, 2. The POVM that distinguishes them has three\nelements, \u03a01 , \u03a02 , and \u03a00 = I \u2212 \u03a01 \u2212 \u03a02 , all of which\nare positive operators. The probability of identifying \u03c1j\nif we are given \u03c1j is pj = Tr(\u03c1j \u03a0j ), and the probability\nof failing to identify it is qj = Tr(\u03c1j \u03a00 ), for j = 1, 2. The\ncondition that a state never be misidentified implies that\n\u03a01 \u03c12 = \u03a02 \u03c11 = 0. The average failure probability is\nQ = \u03b7q1 + (1 \u2212 \u03b7)q2 ,\n\n(1.1)\n\nand our object is to find, for a given \u03b7, a POVM that\nminimizes Q. From the results in [15] and [16], we have\nthat\np\nQ \u2265 2 \u03b7(1 \u2212 \u03b7)F (\u03c11 , \u03c12 ) ,\n(1.2)\n\nwhere the fidelity between the two density matrices is\ngiven by\n1/2\n\n1/2\n\nF (\u03c11 , \u03c12 ) = Tr((\u03c11 \u03c12 \u03c11 )1/2 ) .\n\n(1.3)\n\nThe conditions, under which this bound can be saturated, have been investigated in [18]. In [19] the optimum POVM has been given explicitly for certain special cases. As we shall see, unlike for the case of two\npure states, this bound cannot always be reached for two\nmixed states, in agreement with [18]. The optimal measurement procedure depends on the value of \u03b7, a feature\nit has in common with the procedure for discriminating\ntwo pure states. For two pure states there is always a\nrange of \u03b7 where equality in (1.2) can be reached. In\nthe case of two mixed states, however, the optimal measurement procedure also depends on the structure of the\ntwo density operators, a distinctive feature that has no\nequivalent in the case of two pure states. For \u03b7 near 0\nor 1 the optimal measurements are projective ones. In\nthe intermediate regime, the optimal measurements are\nintermittently POVM's or projective measurements and,\nin general, their failure probability is higher than the fidelity bound (1.2). Only under very special conditions\nshall we find that the fidelity bound can be saturated.\nThe main technical device that we shall use to find the\noptimal measurements is that of Jordan bases. These\nbases take the following form. The states |\u03c81 i, . . . |\u03c8k i\nform an orthonormal basis for S1 , |\u03c8k+1 i, . . . |\u03c82k i form\nan orthonormal basis for S2 , and, in addition these states\nhave the property that\nh\u03c8i |\u03c8k+j i = \u03b4ij cos \u03b8i ,\n\n(1.4)\n\nwhere cos \u03b81 \u2265 cos \u03b82 \u2265 . . . cos \u03b8k , and 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 k. The\nstates |\u03c81 i, . . . , |\u03c8k i and |\u03c8k+1 i, . . . , |\u03c82k i are called Jordan bases and the angles \u03b8i are called the Jordan angles.\nBases satisfying these conditions can be constructed for\nany two subspaces [21]. Note that the basis vectors |\u03c8i i\nand |\u03c8k+i i are eigenvectors of the operators P1 P2 P1 and\nP2 P1 P2 , respectively, where\nP1 P2 P1 |\u03c8i i = cos2 \u03b8i |\u03c8i i ,\nP2 P1 P2 |\u03c8k+i i = cos2 \u03b8i |\u03c8k+i i ,\n\n(1.5)\n\nwhere 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Sec. II is devoted\nto the derivation of the general results. Besides giving\nthe general theory for distinguishing two k dimensional\nsubspaces in a 2k dimensional Hilbert space, these results\nalso hold for a rather general class of density operators,\nso they are directly relevant to the problem of optimal\nunambiguous discrimination between two mixed states.\nIn Sec. III we present some possible applications of the\nresults. Finally, in Sec. IV we give a brief summary and\noutlook for future research.\n\n\f3\nII. DISTINGUISHING SUBSPACES AND ITS\nRELATION TO THE DISCRIMINATION OF\nMIXED STATES\n\nWe shall actually solve a somewhat more general problem than the discrimination of two subspaces. Let S1 and\nS2 be k dimensional subspaces of a 2k dimensional complex Hilbert space H which are in general position, as discussed in the introduction, and let {|\u03c81 i, . . . , |\u03c8k i} and\n{|\u03c8k+1 i, . . . , |\u03c82k i} be Jordan bases associated to these\nsubspaces. Consider the two density matrices\n\u03c11 =\n\nk\nX\ni=1\n\n\u03c12 =\n\nk\nX\ni=1\n\nthonormal basis for S\u03042 , and {|yi i, . . . , |yk i} forms an orthonormal basis for S\u03041 .

In\nthis case the orthonormal frames for the density matrices\ngiven by the spectral theorem coincide with the Jordan\nframes of the supports.

Inserting the weights \u03b1i and \u03b2i will allow us\nto address several issues in the general theory of mixed\nstate discrimination.\nWe will now construct an optimal POVM to unambiguously discriminate between \u03c11 and \u03c12 . The POVM\nelements are \u03a01 , \u03a02 and \u03a00 = I \u2212 \u03a01 \u2212 \u03a02 with the\nproperties as discussed in the introduction. \u03a01 and \u03a02\nare self adjoint operators supported on S\u03042 and S\u03041 , respectively. In order for them to form an optimal POVM\nthey must be positive and, crucially, the rank of \u03a00 must\nnot exceed k [17]. We wish to choose \u03a01 and \u03a02 so that\nthe expression P (\u03b7) = \u03b7Tr(\u03a01 \u03c11 ) + (1 \u2212 \u03b7)Tr(\u03a02 \u03c12 ) is\nmaximized. This is the same as minimizing the average\nfailure probability Q(\u03b7) = \u03b7Tr(\u03a00 \u03c11 ) + (1 \u2212 \u03b7)Tr(\u03a00 \u03c12 )\nthat was introduced in (1.1).\nLet Ti be the linear subspace spanned by |\u03c8i i and\n|\u03c8i+k i. The Ti 's, with 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k, are mutually orthogonal, two dimensional subspaces, which are invariant under both \u03c11 and \u03c12 . Let us define states |zi i and |yi i\nas\n|\u03c8i i = sin \u03b8i |zi i + cos \u03b8i |\u03c8i+k i\n|\u03c8i+k i = sin \u03b8i |yi i + cos \u03b8i |\u03c8i i,\n\n(2.4)\n\nbii \u03b2i sin2 \u03b8i .\n\n(2.5)\n\nand\nk\nX\ni=1\n\n\u03b1i |\u03c8i ih\u03c8i | ,\n\n\u03c11 = (1/k)\n\naii \u03b1i sin2 \u03b8i ,\n\ni=1\n\np2 = Tr(\u03a02 \u03c12 ) =\n\n\u03b2i |\u03c8i+k ih\u03c8i+k | ,\n\nk\nX\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere |zi i (|yi i) is the orthogonal complement of |\u03c8i+k i\n(|\u03c8i i) in Ti . Furthermore {|z1 i, . . . , |zk i} forms an or-\n\nThese equations do not depend upon the off-diagonal\nterms of \u03a01 and \u03a02 . If \u03a01 and \u03a02 are to be elements\nof a POVM they must be positive so aii , bii \u2265 0 is a minimum requirement. The presence of off-diagonal elements\nimposes additional restrictions on the diagonal elements\nif we wish to ensure positivity. Since the off-diagonal elements do not play a role in p1 and p2 , it suffices to search\nfor our optimal POVM among the diagonal operators.\nLet p\u0304i = h\u03c8i |\u03a01 |\u03c8i i and p\u0304i+k = h\u03c8i+k |\u03a02 |\u03c8i+k i be\nthe individual success probabilities of the Jordan basis\nstates for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k. Let q\u0304i = h\u03c8i |\u03a00 |\u03c8i i and q\u0304i+k =\nh\u03c8i+k |\u03a00 |\u03c8i+k i be the individual failure probabilities of\nthe Jordan basis states for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k. Here we introduced\nthe overbar notation in order to distinguish the partial\nsuccess and failure probabilities, p\u0304i and q\u0304i , of |\u03c8i i from\nthe total success and failure probabilities, pj and qj , of \u03c1j\nfor i \u2264 k and j = 1, 2. Obviously, p\u0304i + q\u0304i = 1 holds. We\nP\ncan then express the POVM operators as \u03a01 = ki=1 \u03a01,i\nPk\nand \u03a02 = i=1 \u03a02,i where\n\u03a01,i =\n\n1 \u2212 q\u0304i\n|zi ihzi |,\nsin2 \u03b8i\n\n(2.6)\n\nand\n1 \u2212 q\u0304i+k\n|yi ihyi |.\n(2.7)\nsin2 \u03b8i\nPk\nWe can also set \u03a00 =\ni=1 \u03a00,i , where \u03a00,i = ITi \u2212\n\u03a01,i \u2212 \u03a02,i , and ITi is the identity in Ti .\nWe now need to determine the values of q\u0304i and q\u0304i+k .\nThis can be done by noticing that what we have done is to\nreduce our problem to k problems of optimally discriminating two vectors, in particular the vector |\u03c8i i from the\nvector |\u03c8i+k i in Ti . In more detail the situation is the following. In our overall ensemble, with \u03c11 occurring with\nprobability \u03b7 and \u03c12 with probability 1 \u2212 \u03b7, the probability of occurrence for |\u03c8i i is \u03b7\u03b1i and the probability\nfor the occurrence of |\u03c8i+k i is (1 \u2212 \u03b7)\u03b2i . Therefore, the\nprobability for the occurrence of a vector in Ti is just the\nsum of these probabilities,\n\u03a02,i =\n\np(Ti ) = \u03b7\u03b1i + (1 \u2212 \u03b7)\u03b2i\n\n(2.8)\n\nNow, the probability that |\u03c8i i occurs given that Ti has\nocurred is p(i|Ti ) = \u03b7\u03b1i /p(Ti ) and the probability that\n\n\f4\n|\u03c8i+k i occurs given that Ti has occurred is p(i + k|Ti ) =\n(1 \u2212 \u03b7)\u03b2i /p(Ti ). Consequently, in Ti we want to unambiguously discriminate |\u03c8i i occurring with probability\np(i|Ti ) and |\u03c8i+k i occuring with probability p(i + k|Ti )\nso as to minimize the failure probability\n\nsum the center lines for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k. The summation\nyields\n\nQi (\u03b7) = p(i|Ti )q\u0304i + p(i + k|Ti )q\u0304i+k .\n\nClearly, this absolute minimum can only be realized if\nand only if the intersection of all of the intervals Ii is not\nempty and the operating value of \u03b7 is in this intersecton.\nThe interpretation of this expression is straightforward. Making use of the structure of the Jordan bases,\n1\n1\nP\nwe obtain \u03c112 \u03c12 \u03c112 = i \u03b1i \u03b2i cos2 \u03b8i |\u03c8i ih\u03c8i |, after a simple calculation. Comparing this expression with Eq. (1.3)\ntells us immediately that Eq. (2.17) can be cast to the\nform\np\n(2.18)\nQopt = 2 \u03b7(1 \u2212 \u03b7)F (\u03c11 , \u03c12 ) ,\nP \u221a\nwhere F (\u03c11 , \u03c12 ) =\n\u03b1i \u03b2i | cos \u03b8i |. Here F (\u03c11 , \u03c12 ) is\ni\nthe fidelity between \u03c11 and \u03c12 , constructively proving\nthat the fidelity bound, Eq. (1.2), can be saturated. To\nobtain an explicit expression for the fidelity would be a\nhopeless task, in general. What made it possible here is\nthe fact that the density operators are diagonal in the\nJordan bases of their support and we could take full advantage of the ensuing Jordan structure. Furthermore,\nthe above expression for the optimum failure probability\nholds only if \u03b7 is an element of the intersection of all of\nTk\nthe Ii intervals, I0 = i=1 Ii . I0 may be empty, it often is.

To this end, we first\nintroduce a one-parameter characterization of \u03c11 and \u03c12 .\nLet us set \u03b11 = \u03b1 and, consequently, \u03b12 = 1 \u2212 \u03b1. Similarly, we set \u03b21 = \u03b2 and, consequently, \u03b22 = 1 \u2212 \u03b2. We\ncan now introduce a two-dimensional parameter plane,\n\u03b1\u03b2, where the square in the first quadrant, bounded by\n0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 1 and 0 \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264 1, corresponds to physically acceptable choices for mixed states. So our task is reduced\nto finding the regions within this square with qualitatively different overlap patterns. When cos2 \u03b81 > cos2 \u03b82 ,\nwhich is the convention that we adopted at the beginning, the patterns can be sorted into five categories:\ni) d1 < c2 , i. e. I1 is to the left of I2 and their intersection\nis empty.

In\nthese examples we prescribe \u03a00 by giving its eigenvectors\n|\u03b6i i and eigenvalues \u03bbi for the possible \u03b7 interval configurations. We adopt the notation |\u03b6i (\u03b7)i (\u03bbi (\u03b7)) for the\neigenvector (eigenvalue) corresponding to q\u0304i (\u03b7) = q\u0304iopt .\nIn our first example we consider the case where \u03c11 and\n\u03c12 are uniformly mixed, corresponding to subspace discrimination.

Table I summarizes the behavior of \u03a00 in each of the subintervals.\nFor our second example we choose \u03c11 and \u03c12 so that\nd1 \u2264 c2 , which can be easily arranged by picking \u03b2 <\n\u03b2\u03041 (\u03b1).

For each of\nthe five regions of the \u03b1\u03b2 parameter plane the operating\nvalue of \u03b7 can have five possibilities. It can be outside\n\n\f6\nof the intervals I1 and I2 (three such intervals if I1 and\nI2 do not intersect and two if they do), it can be in the\nnonoverlapping regions of I1 and I2 (two such intervals)\nand, finally, it can be in the intersection of I1 and I2\n(zero or one such interval). The five parameter regions\nand the five possibilities for \u03b7 in each of these regions give\nus altogether twenty five characteristically different cases.\nIn only three of them can the fidelity bound be reached.\nIn twelve cases the optimum measurement is a standard\nvon Neumann projection and in the remaining ten cases\nit is a combination of projections in some dimensions and\nPOVMs in the others.\nWe believe that these trends are general and they hold\nfor the discrimination of any Rank 2 mixed states not\njust the ones where the Jordan basis coincides with the\nspectral representation but it will be much harder to find\nexplicitly the different regions in the parameter space and\nthe different intervals of the prior probability \u03b7. We also\nconjecture that for the discrimination of two Rank N\nmixed states there are (2N + 1)N cases altogether and\nthe fidelity bound can be reached in only 2N \u2212 1 of them.\nSince the growth in the number of possibilities as a function of N is faster than exponential it seems as though\nit would be extremely difficult to give a complete classification of the cases for N > 2. Furthermore, since the\nnumber of cases when the fidelity bound can be reached\ngrows only linearly with N , the weight of the density\noperators for which the fidelity bound can be attained\nquickly becomes negligible with increasing N .\n\nIII.\n\nAPPLICATIONS\n\nLet us now consider a simple example that we will\nbe able to use as the basis for applications of subspace\ndiscrimination. Let H be a four-dimensional space with\nthe orthonormal basis {|ji | j = 0, . . . , 3}. For the first\nsubspace, S1 , we choose the span of the vectors |0i and\n|1i, and for the second, S\u221a2 we choose the span of \u221a\nthe\nvectors |u0 i = (|0i + |2i)/ 2 and |u1 i = (|1i + |3i)/ 2.\nThe states {|0i, |1i} and {|u0 i, |u1 i} form Jordan bases\nfor the subspaces S1 and S2 . Defining the vectors\n|y1 i = |2i\n1\n|z1 i = \u221a (|0i \u2212 |2i)\n2\n\n|y2 i = |3i\n1\n|z2 i = \u221a (|1i \u2212 |3i), (3.1)\n2\n\nwe have that S\u03041 is the span of |y1 i and |y2 i, and S\u03042 is the\nspan of |z1 i and |z2 i. Application of the formulas in the\nprevious section gives us the POVM for discriminating\nbetween S1 and S2 . The POVM exists for 1/3 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 2/3,\nwhere the detection operators are given by\nr\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u221a \u221a\n1\u2212\u03b7\nP\u03042\n2\n2\u2212\n\u03b7\n\u0013\n\u0012\nr\n\u221a \u221a\n\u03b7\nP\u03041 .\n= 2\n2\u2212\n1\u2212\u03b7\n\n\u03a01 =\n\u03a02\n\n(3.2)\n\np\nThe corresponding failure probability is Q = 2\u03b7(1 \u2212 \u03b7).\nWe also mention here that this solution was already derived in [18] using a slightly less general approach.\nOne possible application of this POVM is the following. Suppose that Alice and Bob cannot communicate\nwith each other, but they can communicate with Charlie. Charlie wants Alice and Bob to share a secure bit\nstring. He sends to Alice and Bob one particle each from\neither of the two-particle states\n1\n|\u03a80 i = \u221a (|0ia |1ib + |1ia |0ib )\n2\n1\n|\u03a81 i = \u221a (|u0 ia |u1 ib + |u1 ia |u0 ib ).\n2\n\n(3.3)\n\nIf Alice and Bob both succeed in identifying which state\nwas sent, they share a bit, |\u03a80 i corresponding to 0 and\n|\u03a81 i corresponding to 1. The reduced density matrices\nthat Alice and Bob must distinguish are \u03c10 = (1/2)P1 ,\nwhich results if |\u03a80 i is sent, and \u03c10 = (1/2)P2 , which\nresults if |\u03a81 i is sent. The above POVM does this optimally (we shall assume that \u03b7 = 1/2). The procedure\nwould be the following. Charlie sends one of the two\nstates to Alice and Bob (one particle to each). They\nindependently perform their measurements. They then\ntell Charlie whether they succeeded, and he tells each of\nthem whether the bit is valid or not. The bit is valid\nwhen both Alice's and Bob's measurements succeeded,\nand invalid otherwise.\nThe security comes from the fact that |\u03a80 i and |\u03a81 i are\nnot orthogonal. An eavesdropper, Eve, cannot perfectly\ndistinguish these two states. Her measurement procedure will either sometimes produce errors or sometimes\nfail. She must, however, send particles on to Alice and\nBob. There is no state she can send them that will guarantee that one or both of their measurements fail, so that\nsometimes Alice's and Bob's measurements will tell them\nthat they have received a state different from the one that\nCharlie sent. By comparing some of their bits with those\nof Charlie, they can tell whether this has occurred. One\npossibility is that they can use some of the invalid bits,\nin particular the ones for which one of the measurement\nsucceeded and the other did not. For example, if Alice's\nmeasurement succeeded, then she can tell Charlie the result of her measurement, and Charlie can see whether it\ncorresponds to the state that he sent. If it does not, then\nthey know that an eavesdropper was present.\nA second example concerns operator discrimination\n[22]-[24]. Alice starts with the two-qubit state, |\u03a8in i =\n|0i|0i. She sends the state through one of two black\nboxes, each black box performing an operation on the\ninput state. The first black box performs an unknown,\narbitrary single qubit rotation on the second qubit. The\nsecond first performs an unknown, arbitrary single qubit\nrotation on the second quibit and a Hadamard operation\non the first, and this is followed by sending both quibits\nthrough a C-NOT gate, with the first qubit as the control and the second as the target. Alice then sends the\nresulting output state to Bob, who must decide which\n\n\f7\nblack box Alice used. Note that what is being done here\nis the discrimination between two sets of operators; the\nfirst black box performs an abitrary operator from the\nfirst sent and the second black box performs an arbitrary\noperator from the second set.\nIf the input state is sent through the first black box,\nthe output state that is sent to Bob is\n\nstruction of this POVM made use of the Jordan bases of\nthe two subspaces. The results are, in fact, more general\nthan what is stated in the title. They represent the complete solution to the problem of optimal unambiguous\ndiscrimination between mixed states of a special class,\nviz. between those states for which the spectral form\ncoincides with the Jordan representation.\n\n|\u03a81out i = \u03b1|0i|0i + \u03b2|0i|1i,\n\nWe presented two applications of the measurement\nprocedure, discriminating between two-particle states if\none has only one of the particles and deciding to which\nof two sets an unknown quantum operation belongs.\n\n(3.4)\n\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are unknown. If the input state was sent\nthrough the second black box, Bob receives the state\n1\n|\u03a82out i = \u221a [\u03b1(|0i|0i + |1i|1i)\n2\n+\u03b2(|0i|1i + |1i|0i).\n\n(3.5)\n\nThe state |\u03a81out i lies in the subspace spanned by the\nvectors {|0i|0i, |0i|1i} and the state |\u03a82out i lies in the\nspace spanned by {(|0i|0i+|1i|1i), (|0i|1i+|1i|0i)}. That\nmeans that distinguishing |\u03a81out i and |\u03a82out i reduces to\nthe problem of distinguishing these two supspaces. Making the correspondence with our previous example\n|0i|0i \u2192 |0i\n|0i|1i \u2192 |1i\n\n|1i|1i \u2192 |2i\n|1i|0i \u2192 |3i,\n\nThis procedure can be used to distinguish arbitrary\nmixed states by discriminating between their supports,\nbut the results will not, in general, be optimal. In order\nto optimally discriminate between mixed states the structure of the states within their supports must be taken into\naccount. Based, however, on the results of this paper we\nbelieve that this is an extremely difficult task for density\nmatrices of Rank > 2. The case of optimally discriminating between arbitrary Rank 2 density matrices appears\nmore tractable, however. How it can be accomplished is\na problem that still remains open.\n\n(3.6)\n\nwe see that the problem reduces to the one we have already solved. The subspace in which |\u03a81out i lies corresponds to S1 and the one in which |\u03a82out i lies corresponds to S2 . Therefore, the POVM we have already\nfound will optimally distinguish (assuming that the input state is |0i|0i) through which black box the input\nstate was sent.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe have presented a POVM that optimally and unambiguously discriminates between two subspaces.
