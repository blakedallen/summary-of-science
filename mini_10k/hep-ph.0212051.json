Pakvasa and K. Zuber\nDepartment of Physics and Astronomy, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI\nDenys Wilkinson Laboratory, University of Oxford, Keble Road, Oxford, OX1 3RH\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe last few years have seen growing evidence for non-vanishing\nneutrino rest masses in the results from neutrino oscillation experiments [1]. However, the direct bounds on neutrino masses\nremain rather weak. While the electron neutrino mass is known\nto be smaller than about 2.2 eV [2], the muon neutrino mass has\nto be smaller than 170 keV [3], a bound about 5 orders of magnitude worse and still as high as 30 % of the electron mass. The\nsituation is even worse by another two orders of magnitude for \u03bd\u03c4\nwhich is known from ALEPH to be smaller than 18.2 MeV [4]. In\nthis paper we explore leptonic DS\u00b1 decays for improving on the\nbound of \u03bd\u03c4 .\n\n2\n\nLeptonic DS\u00b1 decays\n\nIn the standard model the leptonic branching ratios of DS\u00b1 are\ngiven as\nBR(DS\u00b1\n\nG2F\nm2l 2\n2 2\n2\n\u2192 l\u03bd\u0304l ) =\n| Vcs | fDS \u03c4DS mDS ml F (1 \u2212 2 ) (1)\n8\u03c0\nmDS\ni\n\n\fwith Vcs is the corresponding CKM matrix element, \u03c4DS the DS\u00b1\nlife-time, mDS the mass of the DS\u00b1 , fDS the decay constant and\nml the lepton mass, and F is a phase space factor which depends\non the neutrino mass (F = 1 when neutrino mass is zero). Several\nquantities cancel when the ratio of two leptonic branching ratios\nis taken and furthermore this ratio is quite sensitive to the \u03bd\u03c4 mass\n[5]. Neglecting the muon neutrino mass to first approximation,\nthe ratio between muonic and tauonic decays can be parametrised\nas a function of \u03bd\u03c4 mass to first order in m\u03bd\u03c4\nm\u03bd\n(DS\u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 )\n= R0(m\u03bd = 0) \u00d7 1 \u2212 C( \u03c4 )2\nR=\n\u00b1\n(DS \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bc )\nm\u03c4\n\n!\n\n(2)\n\nR0 is obtained as\n1\u2212\n\nm2\nR0 (m\u03bd = 0) = 2\u03c4\nm\u03bc\n\nm2\u03c4\nm2 \u00b1\n\n!2\n\nm2\u03bc\nm2 \u00b1\n\n!2\n\nDs\n\n1\u2212\n\nDs\n\n= 9.79\n\n(3)\n\nC is given by\nC=\n\n3(m\u03c4 /mD\u00b1 )4 \u2212 1\nS\n\n(1 \u2212 (m\u03c4 /mD\u00b1 )2)2\n\n= 28.77\n\n(4)\n\nS\n\nThe values were obtained using m\u03c4 =1777 MeV and mD\u00b1 =1969\nS\nMeV [11]. The ratio R as a function of m\u03bd\u03c4 is plotted in Fig.1. As\nexpected, the figure shows that the ratio decreases as the mass of\n\u03bd\u03c4 is increased. Furthermore, it follows from Eq. 4 that to improve\nthe bound on m\u03bd\u03c4 down to 10 MeV would correspond to a 0.1 %\neffect on R only. To achieve the latter bound would be especially\ninteresting, because it would close the window for observation of\na MeV Majorana neutrino in double beta decay via atomic mass\ndependent effects[6,7].\nWe have not yet discussed the role of radiative corrections to the\nratio R0 . For the case of \u03c0 decays these have been carefully calii\n\n\fFig. 1. The ratio R defined in Eq.(2) as a function of the mass of \u03bd\u03c4 . The existing\nupper bound on m\u03bd\u03c4 obtained by ALEPH is 18.2 MeV. No radiative corrections are\nincluded. For details see text.\n\nculated and are well-known[8,9]. A complete calculation of analogous radiative corrections for DS\u00b1 decays is yet to be done. It is\nexpected that these corrections would be in the range of 2 to 4 %.\nThis will modify the bound on \u03bd\u03c4 mass. To extract a meaningful\nlimit on the mass of \u03bd\u03c4 it will be necessary to have the radiative\ncorrections to the value of R available.\nOne can also compare inclusive decay rates, rather than the exclusive modes above. The ratio\nR\u03bc,\u03c4 =\n\n\u0393(DS\u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 + DS\u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 \u03b3)\n\u0393(DS\u00b1 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bc + DS\u00b1 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bc \u03b3)\n\n(5)\n\nis free from any dependence on energy resolution and for a pointlike DS\u00b1 the expression is as given in [10]. This gives a correction\nof 2.4 % in the direction of increasing the tau branching ratio.\nIn both cases, it would be desirable to have an estimate of the\nremaining structure dependent corrections, although we believe\nthat they would not be larger than the effects already included\nhere.\nSimilar considerations can be applied to the decays of D+ as\nwell. However, the rates in that case are suppressed by the CKM\niii\n\n\fsuppression as well as phase space, and the branching ratios are\nsmaller than for Ds decays by an order of magnitude or more.\nThis make D+ unsuited for extracting mass limits on the tau\nneutrino.\n\n3\n\nExperimental status\n\nThe current status of leptonic branching ratios of interest are\ncompiled in Tab. 1. As can be seen, all measurements still have\nlarge errors. Taking the PDG values [11] implies R = 12.5 \u00b1 5.5,\nclearly not allowing any conclusions on m\u03bd\u03c4 . However recently\nthere have been improvements in investigations of DS\u00b1 decays at\nLEP. Using the branching ratio values of ALEPH [15] a ratio of\nR = 8.5 \u00b1 5.2 can be obtained, unfortunately still having a much\ntoo large an error for the purpose at hand. The situation might\nbe improved by producing a clean and statistically large sample\nby looking at diffractive DS\u00b1 production in antineutrino-nucleon\nscattering at a neutrino factory [18] or accurate measurements\nat the planned CLEO-c charm factory [19]. For the latter an\naccuracy on both branching ratios of 4 % is predicted. If we\nassume that the central values remain the same as obtained by\nALEPH this would imply a value of R = 8.5 \u00b1 0.5, which is\nsignificantly away from R0 . The accuracy in R, of about 6 %,\nwould be a great improvement over the current one, but still not\nquite at the level needed to get improved bounds on the \u03bd\u03c4 mass,\nwhich calls for a level of less than 1 %.\n\n4\n\nSummary\n\nWe discuss the possibility of gaining information on the mass\nof the tau neutrino by investigating leptonic DS\u00b1 decays. An improvement on the m\u03bd\u03c4 down to 10 MeV is possible if the ratio\nof muonic and tauonic DS\u00b1 decays can be measured with an accuracy of 0.1 %. While current data do not allow to draw any\niv\n\n\fTable 1\nSummary of the available experimental leptonic branching ratios of DS\u00b1 .
