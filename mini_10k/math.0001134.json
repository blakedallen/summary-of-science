Hypersurfaces\n\narXiv:math/0001134v1 [math.DG] 25 Jan 2000\n\nMichael Eastwood and Vladimir Ezhov\nAbstract: We exhibit a family of homogeneous hypersurfaces in affine space, one in each\ndimension, generalising the Cayley surface.\n\nThe Cayley surface in affine three space is given by\nx3 = x1 x2 \u2212 13 x1 3 .\nSee, for example, [3, Chapter III \u00a76] for a discussion of its properties. In N-dimensions,\nwe may consider the hypersurface given by\n\u03a6N (x1 , x2 , . . . , xN ) \u2261\n\nN\nX\n\n(\u22121)d 1d\n\nd=1\n\nd\nX z }|\n{\nxi xj * * * xm = 0.\n\n(1)\n\ni+j+***+m=N\n\nThis is the Cayley surface when N = 3. The next few are as follows.\nx4 = x1 x3 + 12 x2 2 \u2212 x1 2 x2 + 14 x1 4\nx5 = x1 x4 + x2 x3 \u2212 x1 2 x3 \u2212 x1 x2 2 + x1 3 x2 \u2212 51 x1 5\nx6 = x1 x5 + x2 x4 + 21 x3 2 \u2212 x1 2 x4 \u2212 2x1 x2 x3 \u2212 31 x2 3 + x1 3 x3 + 32 x1 2 x2 2 \u2212 x1 4 x2 + 61 x1 6 .\nSince the first term in (1) is \u2212xN and this is the only occurrence of this variable, these\nhypersurfaces are polynomial graphs over the remaining variables.\nThe Cayley surface is affine homogeneous. This follows immediately from \u03a63 being\nannihilated by the following two linearly independent affine vector fields:\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+ x1\n+ x2\n\u2202x1\n\u2202x2\n\u2202x3\n\nand\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+ x1\n.\n\u2202x2\n\u2202x3\n\nThe hypersurface defined by (1) generalises sufficiently many properties of the Cayley\nsurface that we call it the Cayley hypersurface. That it is affine homogeneous is an\nimmediate consequence of the following:\nProposition 1 The polynomial \u03a6N (x1 , x2 , . . . , xN ) is annihilated by the vector fields\nN\nX\n\u2202\n\u2202\nxh\u2212p\n+\nXp \u2261\n\u2202xp h=p+1\n\u2202xh\n\nfor p = 1, 2, . . . , N \u2212 1.\nProof. We compute\nN\nX z d\u22121\nX\n}| {\n\u2202\nd\n(\u22121)\nxj * * * xm\n\u03a6N =\n\u2202xh\nj+***+m=N \u2212h\nd=1\n\n1\n\nfor h = 1, 2, . . . N\n\n(2)\n\n\fwith the convention that a product with no terms is 1 (so that when h = N, this formula\ngives \u22121 and, otherwise, we can start the sum at d = 2). Therefore,\nXp \u03a6N =\n\n=\n\nN\nX\nd=2\n\nN\nN\nX z d\u22121\nX\nX\nX z d\u22121\n}| {\n}| {\nd\n(\u22121)\nxj * * * xm +\nxh\u2212p\n(\u22121)\nxj * * * xm\n\nN\nX\n\nd\nN\nX z d\u22121\nX\nX z }|\n}| {\n{\nd\n(\u22121)\nxj * * * xm +\n(\u22121)\nxi xj * * * xm .\n\nd=2\n\nd\n\nj+***+m=N \u2212p\n\nh=p+1\n\nd=1\n\nj+***+m=N \u2212h\n\nd\n\nj+***+m=N \u2212p\n\nj+***+m=N \u2212p\n\nd=1\n\nThese expressions evidently cancel.\n\n\u2737\n\nProposition 2 The Cayley hypersurface admits a transitive Abelian group of affine\nmotions.\nProof. The vector fields (2) commute and so may be exponentiated to the required\nAbelian group. (In fact, this is how the Cayley surface is defined in [3, p. 93].)\n\u2737\n\nProposition 3 The isotropy algebra of the Cayley hypersurface is generated by\nH\u2261\n\nN\nX\n\nhxh\n\nh=1\n\n\u2202\n.\n\u2202xh\n\n(3)\n\nProof. Each term in \u03a6N is weighted homogeneous of weight N if xh has weight h.\nIt follows that H\u03a6N = N\u03a6N and, in particular, H\u03a6N |{\u03a6N =0} = 0. We are required to\nprove that, up to scale, H is the only vector field of the form\nX=\n\nN X\nN\nX\ni=1 j=1\n\naij xi\n\n\u2202\n\u2202xj\n\nwith this property. Since \u03a6N is an irreducible polynomial of degree N and X\u03a6N is a\npolynomial of degree at most N, if X\u03a6N vanishes along {\u03a6N = 0}, then X\u03a6 = c\u03a6N for\nsome constant c. Therefore, after adding a suitable multiple of H, it suffices to show\nthat if X\u03a6N = 0, then X = 0. Notice that \u03a6N has the following form\n\u00b1 x1 N /N \u2213 x1 N \u22122 x2 \u00b1 x1 N \u22123 x3 + p(x1 , x2 ) \u2213 x1 N \u22124 x4 + q(x1 , x2 , x3 ) \u00b1 * * *\n| {z } | {z } |\n{z\n} |\n{z\n}\ndeg=N\n\ndeg=N \u22121\n\ndeg=N \u22122\n\ndeg=N \u22123\n\nfor suitable polynomials p(x1 , x2 ), q(x1 , x2 , x3 ), . . . . By considering firstly the leading\nterm xN N /N, it follows that X cannot have any terms in \u2202/\u2202x1 . Alternatively, it is this\nconsideration which determines which multiple of H to use in the initial modification.\nThen, by looking at the term of degree N \u2212 1, we see that X cannot involve \u2202/\u2202x2 .\nThen the terms of degree N \u2212 2 dispense with \u2202/\u2202x3 and so on. Working through \u03a6N\nin this way, it follows that X = 0.\n\u2737\n2\n\n\fProposition 4 The affine normals of the Cayley hypersurface are everywhere parallel\nto the xN -axis.\nProof. At the origin we have\nX\nX\naijk xi xj xk + * * *\nxN =\ng ij xi xj +\ni,j\n\nwhere\n\ni,j,k\n\nn\n1 if i + j = N\n1 if i + j + k = N\nand aijk =\n(4)\n0 else\n0 else.\nP\nijk\nThus gij , the inverse of g ij , is given by the same formula and\n= 0. In\ni,j gij a\nfact, all the higher order tensors are trace-free too. This property of the cubic terms\ncharacterises the affine normal [4]. Note from (2) that the symmetries Xp all commute\nwith \u2202/\u2202xN . It follows that they preserve the xN -direction but, on the other hand,\nsince the affine normal is affinely invariant, these symmetries take one affine normal to\nanother. For the isotropy symmetry (3) we have [\u2202/\u2202xN , H] = N(\u2202/\u2202xN ) which says\nthat the corresponding 1-parameter subgroup simply rescales xN along its axis.\n\u2737\ng ij =\n\nn\n\nWe conjecture these various properties are enough to characterise these hypersurfaces:\nConjecture 1 Suppose \u03a3 is a non-degenerate hypersurface in affine N-space such\nthat:\n\u2022 \u03a3 admits a transitive Abelian group of affine motions\n\u2022 The full symmetry group of \u03a3 has one-dimensional isotropy\n\u2022 The affine normals to \u03a3 are everywhere parallel\n(i.e. \u03a3 is an 'improper affine hypersphere' ).\nThen \u03a3 is given by (1) in a suitable affine co\u00f6rdinate system.\nWe have verified this for hypersurfaces in four dimensions (as a special case of classifying\nthe homogeneous non-degenerate hypersurfaces with isotropy or classifying those with\na transitive Abelian group of affine motions). Details will appear elsewhere. If twodimensional isotropy is allowed, then another variation on the Cayley surface arises,\nnamely\nx4 = x1 x3 + 21 x2 2 \u2212 13 x1 3 .\nThis sort of variation is discussed in [1] and [3, pp. 121\u2013122].\nIn [5], Nomizu and Pinkall give a differential geometric characterisation of the Cayley\nsurface: it is not assumed a priori that the surface is homogeneous. It is not clear how\nto extend this characterisation to Cayley hypersurfaces.\nYet another generalisation of Cayley surface, is suggested by Dillen and Vrancken [2] as\na hypersurface with parallel difference tensor together with some genericity condition.\n\n3\n\n\fThe explicit defining equation (6.3) of [2] very much resembles (1). Curiously, there is\na whole family of homogeneous hypersurfaces\nN\nX\n\n(\u22121)d d!1\n\nd=1\n\nd\u22123\nY\n\nn=0\n\nd\nX z }|\n{\n[(1 \u2212 b)n + 2]\nxi xj * * * xm = 0\ni+j+***+m=N\n\ninterpolating between them. If b = 0 this is (1) and if b = 1 it is (6.3) of [2].\nThe Cayley surfaces are ruled. This property also extends to hypersurfaces:\nProposition 5 If N is odd, then the Cayley hypersurface is uniquely ruled by (N \u22121)/2planes. If N is even, then it is uniquely ruled by (N \u2212 2)/2-planes.\nProof. If N is odd and we fix x1 , x2 , . . . , x(N \u22121)/2 , then (1) is linear in the remaining\nvariables. If N is even and we fix x1 , x2 , . . . , xN/2 , then (1) is linear in the remaining\nvariables. In both cases, uniqueness follows by examining the quadratic terms which\nare non-degenerate of split signature. These determine the possible directions in which\na maximal embedded plane may point, only one of which is consistent with the higher\norder terms.\n\u2737\nFor surfaces, the Pick invariant is precisely the third order obstruction to its being ruled.\nThough there is no such obstruction in higher dimensions, we have:\nProposition 6 The Cayley hypersurfaces have vanishing Pick invariant.\nProof. With reference to (4), the Pick invariant is\nX\ngil gjm gkn aijk almn\ni,j,k,l,m,n\n\nwhich evidently vanishes.\n\n\u2737\n\nAcknowledgement.
