A longterm goal is an improved reliability for a theory that\navoids ad hoc phenomenological parametrizations. One\nparticular aspect of the nuclear binding problem is the\nubiquitous phenomenon of odd-even staggering (OES) of\nbinding energy. Since the early days of BCS theory [4]\nit has been largely attributed to BCS pairing, but there\nare in fact a number of mechanisms that can contribute\n[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. In this work we want to study\nthe performance of BCS and its Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov\n(HFB) extension to the global body of data, taking an\nenergy density functional and pairing functionals that are\nin common use. In that way, we hope to provide a benchmark to assess future improvements in the theory. Since\nwe do not consider all mechanisms to generate the OES,\nour conclusions must be tentative.\nThere are many DFT surveys that treat individual isotope chains, e.g., [13, 14], with the Z=50 isotope chain\na favorite for calculation of pairing properties. We shall\nsee, however, that it can be quite misleading to draw\ngeneral conclusions without examining the whole body\nof OES data. Also, in much of the literature the OES\nwas not obtained from differences of calculated binding\nenergy but rather inferred from the average HFB gap\n\nparameters, as, e.g., in Ref. [15]. We also mention the\nglobal mass tables by the Brussels-Montreal collaboration [16, 17, 18]. While this work achieves a good performance on binding energies, it deviates from the framework of DFT by adding phenomenological modifications\nto the theory. In particular, the pairing strength may\ndepend on local densities but it is hard to justify an explicit dependence on the number parity as is assumed in\nref. [18].\nThere are numerous measures of the OES in the literature, including 3-point, 4-point, and 5-point difference\nformulas [9, 19, 20, 21, 22]. In this work we will use the\n(3)\n3-point formula \u2206o as advocated in Ref. [6] and also\nused in Refs. [10, 15]. For odd neutron number N , it is\ndefined by the binding energy difference\n\u2206(3)\no (N ) =\n\n1\n[B(N + 1) + B(N \u2212 1) \u2212 2B(N )] .\n2\n\n(1)\n\nIn the following, we shall call this quantity the neutron\nOES. Our survey will cover the proton OES as well. One\n(3)\nadvantage of the \u2206o statistic is that it can be applied\nto more experimental data than the higher-order ones.\nAnother advantage is that it suppresses the smooth contributions from the mean field to the gap. The other 3(3)\npoint indicator, \u2206e (N ) with N -even, is less interesting\nfor our purposes because it is more sensitive to singleparticle energies.\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section II outlines\nthe theoretical DFT framework employed in this work.\n\n\f2\nIn Sec. III the selection of experimental data used in the\nsurvey is discussed. The results for selected spherical\nand deformed isotopic/isotonic chains are presented in\nSec. IV while the global performance of our pairing models is analyzed in Sec. V. Finally, Sec. VI contains the\nmain conclusions and perspectives.\nII.\n\nMETHODOLOGIES\n\nWe carry out two independent surveys with the same\nSkyrme functional SLy4 [23] in the particle-hole channel. The pairing functional uses the zero-range densitydependent \u03b4 interaction:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c1(r)\nV (r, r\u2032 ) = V0 1 \u2212 \u03b7\n\u03b4(r \u2212 r\u2032 ).\n(2)\n\u03c10\nHere V0 < 0 is the pairing strength, \u03c1(r) is the isoscalar\nnucleonic density, and \u03c10 =0.16 fm\u22123 . We have performed\nglobal calculations for \u03b7=0, 0.5, and 1, called volume,\nmixed, and surface, pairing, respectively. The volume\npairing interaction acts primarily inside the nuclear volume while the surface pairing generates pairing fields\npeaked around or outside the nuclear surface. As discussed in Ref. [24], different assumptions about the density dependence can result in notable differences of pairing fields in neutron rich nuclei.\nThe two surveys were carried out assuming two different theoretical frameworks for the pairing channel, the\nBCS and the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB). The details are described in the two subsections below.\nA.\n\nHF-BCS with ev8\n\nThe HF-BCS extension of the nuclear DFT can be defined very concisely. The ordinary variables in the theory, namely the orbital wave functions \u03c6i expressed in\nsome basis, are augmented by the BCS amplitudes vi .\nSpecifically, one defines the BCS vi and ui amplitudes\nfor each orbital and calculates the ordinary DFT energy\nfrom\nusing the density matrix \u03c1(r, r\u2032 ) =\nP 2its\u2217 functional\n\u2032\ni vi \u03c6i (r)\u03c6i (r ). To this is added the pairing energy\nfunctional, given by\nX\nX\nVii vi2\n(3)\nEpair =\nVij ui vi uj vj +\ni6=j\n\ni\n\nwhere Vij are the matrix elements of the pairing interaction.\nWe use the code ev8 [25] to carry out the HF+BCS\ncomputations. ev8 solves the HF+BCS equations for\nSkyrme-type functionals via a discretization of the individual wave-functions on a 3D Cartesian mesh and\nthe imaginary time method. (InPev8, the pairing funcThe\ntional (3) is approximated as\ni,j Vij ui vi uj vj .)\npairing interaction matrix elements are those of a densitydependent contact interaction (2). Contact interactions\n\ncan only be used in truncated orbitals spaces; the calculations use the same truncation as is Ref. [26], namely an\nenergy window of 10 MeV around the Fermi level.\nAs we will see later, the OES only fluctuates about\nan average trend by \u223c0.3 MeV, putting a high demand\non the accuracy and the nucleus-to-nucleus consistency\nof the self-consistent mean field calculations. The usual\niteration procedure in ev8 appears to be adequate to\nachieve accuracy at the 100 keV level in several hundred\niterations at a fixed deformation. (Here accuracy means\nwith respect to the fully converged minimum of the numerically implemented energy functional. This numerical functional may contain approximations that give a\nlarger error with respect to the mathematically defined\nfunctional. In the case of ev8, the lattice representation\nof the kinetic operator results in an error of the order of\none MeV in heavy nuclei that varies very smoothly with\n(3)\nA. Thus it largely cancels in the calculation of \u2206o .)\nFinding the minima irrespective of deformation is less\nstraightforward. We adopted the following protocol to\ndetermine them. We first build a table of DFT energies\nand orbital wave functions of the relevant even-even nuclei, using the minimum energy deformations from the\ntable calculated in Ref. [26]. The relative energies of\nspherical and deformed configurations are quite sensitive\nto the pairing interaction, so in the cases where the spherical configuration in that table has an energy close to the\ndeformed minimum, the spherical was also tested. When\nit came out lower with the new pairing interaction, it replaced the old entry in the new table. Next, the table\nwas refined in an iterative way using only the deformation information about neighboring even-even nuclei. If\ntwo neighboring nuclei have substantially different deformations in the table, each configuration must be tested\nin both nuclei. If taking the lower energy configuration\nresults in a change, the process is repeated on the neighbors of the replaced nucleus. This is continued until there\nare no further changes in the even-even DFT solutions.\nOnce the DFT table of even-even nucleus is finalized,\nthe odd-A nuclei are calculated starting from the DFT\nsolutions for the neighboring even-even nuclei. We performed the calculations using the so-called filling approximation for the odd particle [27, 28]. The odd particle\nis assumed to occupy an orbital defined by its position\nin the list of orbitals ordered by single-particle energy.\nThat orbital is blocked by setting v 2 = u2 = 0.5 in the\ncalculation of all ordinary densities, and omitting the\norbital in the summation in Eq. (3). During the selfconsistency iterations, the blocked orbital evolves along\nwith the others, and thus may change character if the relative ordering of the levels changes. Note that the filling\napproximation gives equal occupation numbers to both\ntime-reversed partners, and therefore misses the effects\nof time-odd fields on the OES.\nOur protocol to find the most favorable orbital to block\nwas to examine the five orbitals around the Fermi level\nof the neighboring even-even system. We also tested\nconfigurations generated from the DFT solution for the\n\n\f3\neven-even nucleus with one more nucleon than the target\nodd-A nucleus. Thus the total number of odd-A configurations tested is ten: five starting from the lighter\neven-even core and five starting from the heavier one.\nSince the objective is to determine the level of accuracy that can be achieved, the calculations were carried\nfor the nuclei in the data set for a number of values of\nthe pairing strength V0 . The results below are reported\nfor a value V0 close to that which minimizes the average\n(3)\nresidual in the \u2206o data sets, taking neutron and protons\nindependently.\n\nB.\n\nHFB with hfbtho\n\nThe HFB calculations were carried out with the axial 2D HFB solver hfbtho [29] that has recently been\nimproved by implementing the modified Broyden mixing\n[30] to accelerate the convergence rate.\nThe even-even nuclei are calculated first. An initial set\nof configurations is generated by performing constrained\nminimizations on a quadrupole deformation mesh. Typically, there are 20 calculations having deformations in the\nrange \u22120.5 < \u03b2 < 0.5 with a mesh spacing \u2206\u03b2 = 0.05.\nNext, we turn off the constraint to find the local minima of the energy as a function of \u03b2. When there are\nmultiple minima, we select up to three for further processing, taking no more than one of oblate and prolate\ndeformation, and also the spherical solution if it is a local minimum. The final step is to perform unconstrained\nminimizations on the selected configurations. The iterative minimization is carried out until the maximum\nchange of the matrix elements of the HFB matrix elements falls below 0.0001 MeV. However, in one case the\niteration converges to a limit cycle with energies oscillating by 0.004 MeV. Since this is well below the accuracy\nneeded here, we accepted the (lowest) calculated energy.\nThe minimization for odd N or Z is started from the\ncandidate configurations produced at the second stage of\nthe even-even calculations. As in the BCS, the odd nucleus is treated in the filling approximation, by blocking\none of the orbitals. Here one has to specify which orbitals\nto block to generate the odd-nucleon configurations. The\nblocking candidates are determined by examining the\nHFB quasiparticle spectrum of the neighboring even-even\nnucleus with smaller number of nucleus. Tested are all\none-quasiparticle configurations with quasi-particle energies below the energy cutoff E1qp,cut which is not smaller\nthan 2 MeV for heavy nuclei and not bigger than 8\nMeV for very\u221a light systems. For most nuclei, we take\nE1qp,cut =25/ A MeV. As in the last step for even-even\nnuclei, unconstrained calculations are performed for all\ncandidate configurations to find the absolute minimum\nenergy.\nIn the second variant of HFB calculations (HFB+LN)\nwe performed an approximate particle number projection\n(before variation) using the Lipkin-Nogami (LN) method\n[31, 32]. The practical implementation of the LN treat-\n\nTABLE I: Effective strengths for the pairing interactions derived in the present study by means of Eq. (4).. Units of V0\nare MeV-fm3 .

[33] where the method was compared\nto the full particle number projection.\nIn HFB and HFB+LN calculations we employed the\norbital space extending to 20 major harmonic oscillator\nshells. For the pairing interaction, there is no lower energy orbital cutoff and for the upper equivalent energy\ncutoff we adopted the commonly used value of 60 MeV\n[34]. The calculations were first performed with a standard pairing strength V0std adjusted to the average pairing gap in 120 Sn according to the procedure of [35]. The\nvalues obtained are V0std = \u2212258.2 and \u2212284.57 for the\nHFB and the HFB+LN calculations. However, following\nour first survey, we found these strengths to be too small\nto make a good global fit to OES. We then increased the\npairing strength by a factor of 1.2 and recalculated the\nmass table from scratch. Both sets of tables are available\nthrough the UNEDF SciDAC collaboration [36]. Our fit\nto the global systematics is then made using a linear fit\nof the data sets of the two mass tables:\nM (x) = xM (V0std ) + (1 \u2212 x)M (1.2 * V0std ).\n\n(4)\n\nThe effective pairing strengths obtained in this way is\ngiven by\nV0eff = (1.2 \u2212 0.2x)V0std .\n\n(5)\n\nThe values of x and the derived pairing strengths are\nreported in Table I.\nC.\n\nOther methodological aspects\n\nIn setting up the calculational protocols for the survey, we of course scrutinized cases where the residuals\nbetween theory and experiment were large. The residuals\nare very sensitive to numerical inaccuracies, and their detailed analysis often brought to attention problems with\ncalculated numbers due to, e.g., incorrectly assigned configurations or the lack of convergence in self-consistent\niterations. We could then refine the protocols by making a broader screen or demanding higher precision to\nproduce more accurate tables. From this standpoint we\n(3)\nfound \u2206o a very useful indicator. Also, the fact that the\ntheory is variational is a tremendous help: any change in\nprotocol that gives lower energies is necessarily an improvement.\n\n\f4\n\nIII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DATA BASE\n\nThe data base for our survey derives from the 2003\natomic mass evaluation [40]. The accuracy requirements\nour purposes is of the order of 100 keV, so we only use\nthe masses whose evaluated experimental errors were less\nthan 200 keV. This gives 908 mass triplets for the neutron\nOES and 864 for protons. However, we made additional\ncuts to remove nuclei for which some physics is obviously\nmissing from our BCS or HFB theory. First of all, in oddodd nuclei there is an additional neutron-proton pairing\neffect. Its origin is not completely clear [41], but it is\nobviously beyond the scope of the pairing theory we use\nhere. We therefore do not include binding energy triplets\ncontaining odd-odd nuclei. Another phenomenon in nuclear binding that affects the OES is the so-called Wigner\n\nN=90\n\n(3)\n\n\u2206o (MeV)\n\nApart from the numerics, it should be noted that\nthe pairing gap is a very strong function of the pairing strength. For example, for the HFB calculations, we\nfound that increasing the pairing strength by 20% from\nthe value fitted to 120 Sn, the average neutron pairing gap\nincreases by a factor of 2.3. This sensitivity is not surprising. A typical nucleus in our set has some deformation\nand does not have a large single-particle degeneracy at\nthe Fermi level. This implies that its BCS condensate\nis weak. Under these conditions, the BCS gap increases\nvery quickly from a zero value at some finite strength of\nthe interaction. In fact, we find that roughly 20-30% of\nthe calculated OES contain a nucleus whose BCS or HFB\ncondensate has collapsed. Even in infinite systems having\nno single-particle gap at the Fermi energy, the condensate \u2206 grows exponentially with interaction strength in\nthe well-known BCS formula.\nAn exact implementation of HFB requires the breaking\nof the time-reversal symmetry in the intrinsic frame of an\nodd-A nucleus. The resulting time-odd mean fields contribute to the binding energy of the odd-A system; hence,\n(3)\nthe OES \u2206o depends on whether these time-odd terms\nare included or not [7, 8, 11, 12, 37]. In general, timeodd mean fields are known poorly and their effects differ\nfrom model to model. For instance, in the Skyrme DFT\ncalculations of Ref. [37], the time-odd polarizations systematically shift the hole states down and particle states\nup in energy, while a different result has been obtained\nin the relativistic mean field approach [7, 8]. For the purpose of illustration, Fig. 1 shows the OES calculated in\nthe HFB for isotonic chains including the effects of timeodd fields. A detailed analysis of resulting polarizations\nwill be published elsewhere [38]. It appears that the contribution is less that 100 keV in heavy elements such as\nthe rare earths and actinides, but larger values have been\nfound with other models, eg. [8, 12] and in light nuclei.\nIn any case, the density functional has not been fitted\nto time-odd properties, so no quantitative evaluation of\ntheir effect is possible. In this work, we employ the filling\napproximation, neglecting all time-odd interactions.\n\nN=100\nVT-odd=0\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Impact of time-odd terms on the pro(3)\nton OES \u2206o in the N =90 and 100 isotonic chains calculated\nin the HFB theory with SLy4 functional and mixed pairing.\nSolid lines connect the values of proton OES including timeodd fields; dashed lines show the values of OES omitting the\ntime-odd fields. Calculations were performed with the code\nhfodd of Ref. [39] in a deformed HO basis containing 680\ndeformed harmonic oscillator states.\n\nenergy, an increased binding at N =Z. This might also be\na neutron-proton pairing effect (see, e.g., Refs. [42, 43]).\nWe therefore eliminate triplets that contain N =Z nuclei. More generally, mean-field approximations becomes\ndoubtful when the number of particles is small. Some\nrestriction of light nuclei is imposed by a cut on particle\nnumbers, requiring that the neutron and proton numbers\nbe greater than 8, corresponding to nuclei heavier than\n16\nO. Finally, we only include nuclei with N >Z. There\nare only a few OES on the proton-rich side satisfying\nour other criteria, and keeping a fixed sign of the isospin\nwill permit us to make some qualitative statement about\nthe isospin dependence of the interaction. With all these\ncuts, there are left 443 triplets for the neutron OES and\n418 for the proton in our final data set.\n(3)\nThe sets of neutron and proton \u2206o are plotted as a\nfunction of neutron and proton number in the top panels\nof Fig. 2. Lines connect the values of OES for the same\nnumber of nucleons of the opposite kind. It is common to\nplot OES as a function of A, but plotting it with respect\nto nucleons of the same kind makes clearer the origin of\nfluctuations. Probably the largest cause of fluctuation\nis the variation in single-particle level densities and the\ncharacter of the level at the Fermi energy. This obviously\ndepends strongly on the number of nucleons of the same\nkind, and this motivates the choice of abscissa variable.\nThe single-particle level densities may also change with\nthe different numbers of nucleons of the other kind, particular if the additional nucleons causes a large change in\ndeformation. Such effects should be visible in the variation of OES at fixed value of the abscissa. To emphasize\nthe like-nucleon fluctuations, we also show as solid circles\nthe average with respect to nucleons of the opposite kind.\n\n\f5\n\nOne can see that the shell effects are large and there\nare large fluctuations on the scale of major shell spacings.\n(3)\nFor the neutron values of \u2206o , there are strong dips in\nthe Z-averaged values at N =15, 29, 51, 83, and 125, i.e.,\nin the vicinity of shell closures. We shall call this phenomenon gap quenching. Obviously, the OES is reduced\nwhen one of the three nuclei is at a magic number where\nthe gap in single-particle energies is large. We will examine the effect in more detail below, in presenting the\ntheoretical OES. In Table II we show the extreme OES\ncases\u2013 either the largest or the smallest in our experimental data sets.\n\nnumbers of the other kind, but as mentioned it could be\ndue to other effects such as shape changes. The isospin\ndependence has been examined in Ref. [22] but no significant effect has been found (see also Refs. [45, 46, 47]\nfor more discussion of isovector trends). On the other\nhand, a recent study [48] of the OES of nuclear masses\nfor isotopic chains between the proton shell closures at\nZ=50 and Z=82, including nuclei with extreme isospins,\nhas claimed a significant isospin dependence of pairing.\nWe will discuss in more detail the possible evidence for\nan isovector dependence of the interaction in Sec. V C.\n\nIV.\nTABLE II: Nuclei from the data base adopted for our survey\n(3)\nwith the largest and smallest experimental values of \u2206o (in\nMeV).\n\nneutrons\nprotons\n\nlargest\n(3)\n(N, Z)\n\u2206o\n(21,16)\n1.87\n(12,9)\n2.07\n\nsmallest\n(3)\n(N, Z)\n\u2206o\n(125,82)\n0.32\n(126,81)\n0.31\n\nAnother observation that can be made about the neutron OES is that the variations with respect to Z are particularly large in the regions N =50-60 and 95-110. For\nthe protons, the regions of strongest N -dependence are\nN =35-40 and 60-70. We will see that this is associated,\nat least in part, with changing deformations.\nThe averages and variances for neutron and pro(3)\nton OES \u2206o in the data set are 1.04\u00b10.31 and\n0.96\u00b10.27 MeV, respectively. The lower average for the\nprotons can be largely attributed to the Coulomb interaction: in the liquid drop formula, the term ac Z 2 /A1/3\n(3)\ngives an average value of 0.11 MeV for the proton \u2206o\nin the data set. There is some overall dependence of the\nOES on mass number A which may be seen by visual\ninspection of Fig. 2. For more discussion of the global\nmass dependence of the OES, we refer the reader to\nRefs. [6, 15, 22]. The smooth A-dependence seems rather\nweak compared to the local nucleus-to-nucleus fluctuations caused by shell effects, but parameterizing it in\nsome way can give improved fits. For example, the phenomenological parametrization [19, 44]\n \u0303 = c\n\u2206\nA\u03b1\n\n(6)\n\nwith c=4.66 MeV (4.31 MeV) and \u03b1=0.31 gives an rms\nresidual of 0.25 MeV on the neutron (proton) data set.\nThe global trends given by Eq. (6) are shown as the\ndashed lines in Fig. 2. For the sake of the plot, we averaged over nucleon number of the opposite kind just as\nwas done to produce experimental averages.\nAn important question about the global systematics\nis whether there is an isospin dependence of the pairing interaction. It is clear from Fig. 2 that there can be\nstrong interaction between the pairing of one kind on the\n\nRESULTS: LOCAL COMPARISONS\n\nWe begin our comparison between theory and experiment with two spherical semi-magic isotope chains, Sn\nand Pb. The results of the calculations are shown in\nFig. 3. For all three treatments of pairing, the trends\nof predicted OES are consistent with the data, concerning both global and local variations. In particular, theory reproduces the flatness in the Sn isotopes up to the\nquenched gap at N = 83, and the downsloping trend\nfrom the light Pb isotopes up to the quenched gap at\n207\nPb. In the Sn isotope chain, there is a small dip at\nN = 65 which might be attributed to a neutron subshell\nclosure at N = 64. In any case, the theories all predict\na shallow local minimum. When confronted with experiment, HFB appears to do better slightly than HF+BCS.\nAs mentioned earlier, the strength of the pairing interaction was fit to the overall systematics, giving a somewhat\ntoo high an average OES in both spherical chains. The\nperformance of the theories for long isotonic and isotopic\nchains that include deformed nuclei is illustrated in Fig. 4\nand 5. Fig. 4 shows the neutron OES in the Dy isotopes\n(Z=66) and proton OES in the N =98 isotones. Like in\nthe case of semi-magic nuclei, the agreement with experiment is good, in particular for well deformed nuclei where\nthe mean field changes smoothly with particle number.\nThe effect of changing deformation is illustrated by the\nregion from A \u223c 160 to \u223c 190 which starts deformed and\nbecomes spherical as Z is increased from 66 to 82. The\nneutron values of OES for N = 102 covering this transition region are shown in Fig. 5 as a function of Z. The\nsquares show the experimental OES, which increase from\nabout 0.6-0.8 MeV for the lower Z nuclei and goes up to\n\u223c 1.3 MeV for the singly magic Z = 82 isotope. The\ncircles show the corresponding calculated HFB values of\nOES. The trend is very similar, but the theoretical rise to\nZ=82 is sharper and higher than is seen experimentally.\nVery likely, the increase in single-particle level density\ngoing from deformed to spherical nuclei is responsible for\nincreasing trend in the OES.\nThe fact that our calculations overestimate OES in\nspherical nuclei may be partly attributed to the particle number fluctuations. The pairing gap exponentially\ndepends on the inverse of the single-particle level density\nat the Fermi level, which is large in spherical open-shell\n\n\f6\n2\n\n2\n\n\u2206(3)o MeV\n\nExp. neutron OES\n\nExp. proton OES\n\n1.5\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n2\n\n80\nN\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90 100\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90 100\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90 100\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90 100\n\nZ\n\n2\n\n\u2206(3)o MeV\n\nHFB proton OES\n1.5\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\nHFB neutron OES\n\n0\n\n0\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n2\n\n80\nN\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\nZ\n\n2\n\n\u2206(3)o MeV\n\nHFBLN proton OES\n1.5\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\nHFBLN neutron OES\n\n0\n\n0\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n2\n\n80\nN\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\nZ\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n(3)\n\n\u2206 o MeV\n\nBCS proton OES\n\nBCS neutron OES\n0\n\n0\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\nN\n\n50\nZ\n\n(3)\n\nFIG. 2: OES as a function of nucleon number.

In deformed systems, the level density is\nreduced due to the Jahn-Teller effect [49, 50] and this\ngives rise to the overall pairing reduction; hence, a transition towards the transitional pairing regime, in which the\nparticle number fluctuations are more important. Since\nthe original pairing strength V0std was adjusted to the\nglobal data set containing far more non-spherical nuclei\nthan semi-magic systems, the resulting deformation bias\nresults in too strong pairing correlations predicted for\nspherical nuclei, as seen in Fig. 3. This can be partly\ncured by considering particle-number fluctuations.

The HFB theory has a spike as well as quenchedgap behavior at Z = 81 in the proton gap. The origin of\nthe spike appears to be the coexistence of spherical and\ndeformed configurations in light isotopes of Z=81 and 82\nnuclides. At the phase transition point, there can be a\nlarge static polarization contribution to the OES.\nTo see where theory performs best, and where important physics is missing, in Fig. 6 we show the isospinaveraged residuals for our HFB model. As expected, the\nbest agreement is obtained for well deformed rare earths\nand actinides whose properties vary smoothly with particle number. The largest deviations are seen around shell\nclosures and in the regions of shape coexistence (A\u223c90\nfor neutrons and A=110 and 190 for protons) where dynamic shape fluctuations are known to strongly impact\nmasses [26, 51].\nNeutron variances (exp - HFB)\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n\u03c3 (MeV)\n\nments. The gap quenching is obviously dependent on the\npresence of shell closures, but the fact that it does not\ninvariably occur on both sides of the magic numbers indicates that particular orbital properties must play a role.\nSince the HFB calculations were performed in an axially\nsymmetric basis, we can examine the quantum numbers\nof the blocked orbital. In Table III we show the quasiparticle orbital characteristics for odd nuclei exhibiting\nquenched gaps. The large quenching at N = 125 can\nbe understood as a spherical shell effect associated with\nthe p1/2 shell at the Fermi level. A j = 1/2 shell will\nhave reduced pairing for two reasons. First, there is no\ndegeneracy within the shell to correlate pairs, so all of\nthe pairing has to come from off-diagonal interactions to\nother shell. Second, these couplings are reduced because\nthe spatial overlap of high-l and low-l orbitals is poor.\nSimilar considerations apply to N =15 and Z = 81, where\nthe relevant spherical shell is s1/2 .\nWhile the location of the gap quenching is well reproduced by theory, the magnitude of the effect is often\nexaggerated. Most notably, all the experimental values\nof OES are positive, the theoretical ones at (N, Z) =\n(20 \u2212 24, 15) even have a negative sign.\nComparing the different treatments of pairing, we see\nthat the fluctuations seen are at the same positions in\nBCS and HFB+LN as in the HFB. However, the amplitudes of the fluctuations seem somewhat larger in the\nBCS treatment but somewhat smaller in HFB+LN. It\nis not clear why the BCS should emphasize the fluctuations, but the fact that they are damped in HFB+LN\nis not surprising. In both BCS and HFB the static pairing sometimes collapses in a significant fraction of nuclei,\nas mentioned earlier. The pairing never collapses in the\nHFB+LN treatment, so the OES should be smoother as\none passes into a region of weak pairing.\nLarge variations with proton number are found around\nN \u223c70 and in the region N =100-120.

Fig. 8 shows the theoryexperiment comparison for the HFB methodology. Besides seeing the shell effects discussed above, one also sees\nbetter how the theory performs with respect to the Adependence of the pairing. The theoretical proton OES\nhas an overall A-dependence that seems to accord well\nwith the experimental trend. For the neutron OES, however, the theory is flatter than the experimental trend.\nWe have carried out the survey with different assumptions about the density dependence of the pairing interaction to see sensitivity of the A-dependence to that characteristic. The results of the averaged neutron OES for\nvolume and surface pairing are shown in Fig. 9. The\neffect is very small, except for the light nuclei. In view\nof the other possible contributions to the staggering, we\ndo not believe that one can reliably extract the density\ndependence of the effective pairing interaction strength\nfrom the observed A-dependence. We discuss below another mechanism that could simulate the observed trend\nin A, namely an isospin dependence of the effective pairing interaction.\n\nB.\n\nexp\nHFB\n\n0.3\n\nPerformance statistics\n\nIn Table IV we report the rms residuals for the OES in\nthe various treatments, fitting the strength of the pairing\ninteraction separately for neutrons and protons. In the\ncase of our HFB and HFB+LN models, we carried out\nseparate optimizations for neutrons and protons with respect to the x parameter in Eq. (4). The effective pairing\nstrength obtained in this way is given by Eq. (5). A more\nproper procedure would be to make a two-dimensional\noptimization based on recalculated HFB mass tables assuming different strengths of proton and neutron pairing.\nOur experience with HF+BCS model, however, is that\nthe neutron pairing strength does not significantly affect\n(3)\nthe proton \u2206o and vice versa, at the level of changes\n\n0.8\n\n\u0394(3)\n\u03bf (MeV)\n\n\u03c3 (MeV)\n\nNeutron variances (HFB-exp)\n\n0.4\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\nNeutron number N\nProtons\n\n2.0\n1.6\n1.2\n0.8\n0.4\n0\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nProton number Z\nFIG. 8: (Color online) Comparison between calculated (HFB\n(3)\nwith mixed pairing) and experimental \u2206o values.

Therefore, for the purpose of a\nglobal survey, a simplified treatment has been adopted.\nFrom Table IV we see that all three treatments of the\npairing can achieve the performance of zeroth order description as a constant (or phenomenological) gap, but\nonly the Lipkin-Nogami, shown on the next-to-last line,\ndoes significantly better. In the HFB+LN, pairing correlations are always present. This is particularly important\nfor odd-A nuclei, where the standard blocking procedure\noften gives rise to the unphysical pairing collapse, artificially affecting the OES and producing an exaggerated\nfluctuation. However, one should be cautious in using the\nHFB+LN. While for open-shell systems using it gives a\ngood agreement with those of the HFB with the full particle number projection before variation, the method is\ninaccurate for closed-shell systems [33]. Consequently,\nit is safest to use HFB+LN only away from the magic\nnumbers. In addition, the numerical procedure to find\nthe solution lacks stability when there is a large gap at\nthe Fermi level. Nevertheless, we obtained converged solutions for 440 out the 443 neutron triplets and 411 out\nthe 418 proton triplets with our HFB+LN implementa-\n\n\f10\nC.\n\n2\n\nBCS volume/BCS surface\nMeV\n\n1.5\n\n\u2206\n\n(3)\n\no(N)\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\nN\n\nFIG. 9: Averaged BCS neutron OES with the volume (squares\nconnected by dotted line) and surface (circles connected by\nsolid line) pairing interactions of Eq.

The nuclear interaction may\nbe assumed to conserve isospin at a fundamental level\nbut the coupling to core excitations can be different for\nneutron and protons when the core has a neutron excess. Another isospin-dependent contribution to pairing\ncomes from the Coulomb interaction. Indeed, inclusion\nof the Coulomb has been found to substantially suppress\nthe pairing interaction energy [60] and the pairing gaps\n[55]. In the last column of the Table IV we report the\nratio of neutron and proton interaction strengths we ex(3)\ntract from our fits to \u2206o . The effective proton strength,\n(3)\nneeded to reproduce experimental \u2206o , is larger than the\nneutron strength. If the Coulomb were included explicitly, we would expect that the needed nuclear interaction\nwould be even larger for the protons. Since the underlying strong interaction is isoscalar to a good approximation, we believe that our inferred isospin effect must\narise from induced three-body interactions involving the\nneutron excess. We note in passing that a number of\nmass table fits by the Goriely group arrive at pairing\nstrengths larger for protons than neutrons. An example is the HFB-14 model [17], shown in the last line of\nTable IV. However, since different interactions are used\nfor even and odd nuclei in HFB-14, the results are not\ndirectly comparable.\nAs another way to test the data for an isospindependent pairing interaction, we separate the nuclei into\ntwo subsets according to neutron excess, and compare the\naverage residual OES. To define the subsets, we first divide the nuclei into five A-bins. For each bin we make\na cut at some value of I = (N \u2212 Z)/A to have roughly\nequal numbers for the two sets, which we designate \"low\nisospin\" and \"high isospin\". In that way the effect of any\nA-dependence in the OES will be reduced. The binning\n(3)\nfor proton and neutron values of \u2206o has to be done separate to get balanced sets. The average values of OES\nfor the two sets are reported in Table V. The empir(3)\n\nOne of the basic questions about nuclear pairing is the\nrole of induced interactions in the effective pairing interaction [5, 53, 54, 55, 56]. Indirect information about\nthis can in principle be obtained by exhibiting the density dependence and the isospin dependence of the effective interaction. It is therefore of interest to examine\ninteractions including a density dependence to see the\nsensitivity. The rms residual for the neutron OES with\nvolume, mixed, and surface pairing in HF+BCS theory\nare shown in Table IV. There is a slight favoring of the\nsurface interaction, but we deem that the difference in\nthe residuals ( 10 %) is too slight to be significant. The\nweak sensitivity to the density dependence confirms the\nresults of other studies [10, 57].\n\nTABLE V: Average \u2206o (in MeV) calculated in HFB+LN\nsorted by neutron excess.

The calculated \u2206o for neutrons\n(3)\nare nearly equal, while the calculated \u2206o for protons\ndo show a difference but much smaller than observed.\nFor both cases, the differences would require weakening\nthe pairing interaction for nuclei with larger neutron ex-\n\n\f11\ncesses. An isospin dependence would have the opposite\nsign for proton and neutron gaps.\nAs a final plausibility check on whether the different\nstrengths could be attributable to some isoscalar threebody interaction, we computed the OES for nuclei on\nthe opposite side of the N = Z line (recall that our fitted\ndata set is restricted to N > Z). This comprises 5 neutron OES and 6 proton OES, excluding as before cases\ninvolving N = Z nuclei. Taking the pairing strengths\nfrom our global fit, we find that the calculated average\nneutron OES is low (by 0.7 MeV) while the calculated\naverage proton OES is too high (by 0.24 MeV). This is\nprecisely the expected direction of the error if the difference in the effective strengths depends on the sign of\nN \u2212Z, as would be required by an overall isoscalar energy\nfunctional [62].\nThus, the main evidence for an isospin dependence in\nthe present theory is the need for different strengths for\nthe overall fits to neutron and proton data sets. This\nresults supports the recent attempts [58, 59] to directly\nparametrize the pairing functional in terms of isovector\ndensities.\nVI.\n\nPERSPECTIVE\n\nThe present study demonstrates that the current state\nof the art in the nuclearDFT permits calculation of OES\nto accuracy of the order of 0.25 MeV rms. This is not a\ntrivial outcome in two respective. First, the binding energies involved range up to nearly four orders of magnitude\nlarger, so there is a high demand on computational precision in carry out the DFT. Second, the pairing gap is a\nhighly sensitive function of the mean field properties such\nas level density, and so the theory needs have an accurate\ntreatment of the single-particle properties. In this work\nwe have only considered the SLy4 functional which has\nknown deficiencies. Clearly further exploration of DFT\nfunctionals is warranted, perhaps including ones having\ndifferent (isoscalar and isovector) effective masses\nWe found no large differences between the BCS and\nHFB treatments. This is not unexpected; it is only near\nthe drip lines that the HFB with its better treatment\nof spacial variations of the anomalous density is needed.\nOn the other hand, we believe that the improvement we\nfound for the HFB+LN treatment is significant, showing\nthat a number-conserving treatment of the pairing correlations is needed. Many of the nuclei, particularly the\nodd ones, are on the edge of collapse of BCS pairing, and\nfor these a number-conserving treatment is essential to\ncalculate the pairing correlation energy. Unfortunately,\nthe LN treatment of number violation is not reliable near\nclosed shells. We would therefore advocate in future using other treatments of number violation, perhaps HFB\nwith variation-after-projection [33], or mapping onto an\nexactly soluble pairing Hamiltonian [61].\nThe global data on OES shows a weak A-dependence\n\nthat is certainly not reproduced with a pairing interaction that is density-independent or has only a mild dependence on density. In the calculations with the BCS theory, the sensitivity to density dependence was explored,\nand it was found that there were only small changes in\nthe overall performance. It should also be noted that the\nmean-field contributions to the OES are highly dependent on A. Thus, firm conclusions about the origin of\nthe A dependence must await surveys based on theory\nthat avoids the filling approximation.\nA very interesting question, related to the density dependence, is where there is an effective isospin dependence of the strength of the pairing interaction. The\nquestion cannot be addressed with confidence by examining individual isotope or isotone chains, because the\nother species of nucleon can affect the effective pairing\nHamiltonian, particularly the single-particle spectrum.\nHowever, from the global survey we find what seems to\nbe a robust result, that the effective pairing strength for\nprotons OES is about 10% larger than for neutron OES.\nThe calculation does not take into account the Coulomb\ninteraction in the pairing channel, but naively that would\nbe expected to decrease the effect strength, not increase\nit. The other possibility to explain the difference is an\ninduced isospin dependence.\nIt is perhaps disappointing that the overall performance of the theory is only slightly better than the naive\none-parameter phenomenology attributing the staggering\nto a constant BCS gap. The two-parameter phenomenological function c/A\u03b1 does slightly better than the theory\noverall. But that form has no justification and the shell\neffects that are faithfully reproduced by the theory are\nmissing. So we conclude that the rms residuals between\ntheory and experiment do not tell the whole story. In\nany case, the promising possibility to surpass the performance of the present phenomenology is to continue\nthe DFT studies with better functionals, including mean\nfield contributions and number-conserving treatments of\npairing.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank A.
