Using the GMOS-South IFU\nin Nod & Shuffle mode we have mapped the continuum and optical absorption lines of this z=0.1055\nfield galaxy. This galaxy has a disturbed morphology, with a halo of diffuse material distributed asymmetrically toward the north. Using the [Oii] emission line (Wo [Oii]=4.1\u00c5) we find that the gas and\nhot OB stars are offset from the older stars in the system. The gas also has a spatially extended and\nelongated morphology with a velocity gradient of 100 \u00b1 20 km s\u22121 across 6 kpc in projection. Using the\nstrong H\u03b3 and H\u03b4 absorption lines we find that the A- stars are widely distributed across the system\nand are not centrally concentrated arguing that the A-star population has formed in molecular clouds\noutside the nucleus. By cross correlating the spectra from the datacube with an A-star template we find\nevidence that the A-star population has a 40 km s\u22121 shear in the same direction as the gas. The disturbed morphology, strong colour gradients and strong H\u03b4 and H\u03b3 absorption lines in SDSSJ 101345.39\nargue that this is a recent tidal interaction/merger between a passive elliptical and star-forming galaxy.\nAlthough based on a single object, these results show that we can spatially resolve and constrain the\ndynamics of this short lived (yet important) phase of galaxy formation in which the evolutionary process\ntake galaxies from star-forming to their quiescent end products.\nSubject headings: galaxies: formation, - galaxies: evolution - galaxies: E+A, galaxies \u2013 single:\nSDSSJ 101345.39+011613.66\nallows us to identify the physical locations of the gas, old\n(K) stars, young OB-stars and (the short-lived) massive\nA-stars, and to decouple their dynamics from their spatial\ndistribution. In this paper we demonstrate the feasibility\nof using an integral field unit (IFU) to study the dynamics\nof H\u03b4S galaxies. We have selected one field galaxy from\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and used the GMOSSouth IFU in Nod & Shuffle mode to study the rest-frame\noptical spectra. Using this technique we can investigate\nthe spatial distribution of star formation through the [Oii]\nemission and the distribution of the young A-stars through\nthe (much stronger) stronger H\u03b4 and H\u03b3 absorption lines.\nIn \u00a72 we present the data reduction and analysis. The\nresults are presented in \u00a73. Finally we summarise our results and present the implications in \u00a74. We use a cosmology with \u03a9m =0.3, \u039b =0.7 and a Hubble constant of\n70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 . In this cosmology, 2 kpc subtends 1\u2032\u2032 on\nthe sky at z = 0.10.\n\n1. introduction\n\nGalaxies with strong Balmer absorption lines in their\nspectra (H\u03b4-strong, or H\u03b4S galaxies) represent a shortlived but potentially important phase in galaxy evolution.\nSuch lines indicate a stellar population dominated by Astars which are normally either absent or overwhelmed by\nthe much brighter OB stars. There is likely a variety of\nphysical mechanisms that can lead to such a stellar population (e.g. Dressler et al. 1982; Couch et al. 1987; Poggianti et al. 1999; Balogh et al. 1999), but most invoke\na major transformation from one galaxy type to another.\nAlthough such galaxies are very rare in the local Universe,\ntheir short lifetime means they could potentially represent\nan important phase in the evolution of most normal galaxies.\nWhile high resolution imaging has demonstrated that\nmost bright, nearby H\u03b4S galaxies are spheroidal, often\nwith signs of interaction (Yang et al. 2004; Couch et al.\n2004; Balogh et al. 2004), the dynamics have been extremely difficult to observe and understand. Norton et\nal. (2001) have obtained longslit spectra of galaxies in\nthe Zabludoff et al. (1996) sample, and find evidence that\nmost of the galaxies are in the process of transforming\nfrom rotationally-supported, gas-rich galaxies to pressuresupported, gas-poor galaxies.\nHowever, longslit spectroscopy mixes spatial and spectral resolution, and a better understanding of the dynamics can be obtained from integral field spectroscopy.

(2003). This field galaxy has a redshift\nz = 0.1055, with J2000 coordinates RA: 10:13:45.39, Dec:\n+01:16:13.66.

For this pilot study, we chose a\nrelatively bright example, with r = 16.3 mag (which corresponds to \u223c 1/3L\u2217). SDSSJ101345.39 has strong absorption lines and weak (but non-negligible) emission lines\n(Fig. 2). Post-starburst galaxies with strong H\u03b4 absorption, but with non-negligible [Oii] or H\u03b1 emission lines are\nusually referred to as e(a) galaxies. However as Balogh\net al. (2004) show, e(a) galaxies with Wo ([Oii])<10\u00c5 and\nWo (H\u03b1)<10\u00c5 appear to have the same properties of strict\nk+a galaxies (which are H\u03b4S but have no detectable [Oii]\nor H\u03b1 emission). k+a galaxies are predominantly bulge\ndominated with little sign of spiral structure and signatures of recent (substantial) bursts of star-formation\n(Balogh et al. 2004). In this study, we have selected one\ngalaxy which falls in this \"k+a plus weak emission\" category in order to compare and contrast the dynamics and\nspatial distribution of the gas with that of the young stellar\ncomponent.\n\nof diffuse material, distributed asymmetrically toward the\nnorth, which may be indicative of a tidal interaction or\nmerger. The GMOS-IFU field of view covers the central nucleus (where most of the stars are located), but the\nmuch lower surface brightness material is located outside\nthe IFU field and extends over a \u223c 10\" radius.\n2.2. SDSS Spectroscopy\nThe SDSS spectroscopy of SDSSJ 101345.39 shows\nstrong H\u03b3 \u03bb4340.5\u00c5 and H\u03b4 \u03bb4101.7\u00c5 absorption lines,\nas well as emission lines.\nFrom the original SDSS\nspectra, we measure Wo (H\u03b4)=7.5\u00c5 in absorption, and\nWo (O[ii])=4.1\u00c5 in emission. The galaxy also shows\nH\u03b1 \u03bb6562.8\u00c5 and [Nii] \u03bb6583.0\u00c5 emission; although the\nmeasured equivalent width of H\u03b1 is 7.9\u00c5, this is compromised by the strong underlying Balmer absorption. Taking into account the underlying absorption, the emission\nline ratios may be indicative of weak AGN activity in the\ngalaxy (although as we show in \u00a73, most of the emission\nis from a resolved component, and we therefore attach a\ncautionary note that, from our current data, the evidence\nfor an AGN is tentative).\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n4000\n\n5000\n\n6000\n\n7000\n\nFig. 2.- SDSS spectra of SDSSJ 101345.39. This spectrum has\na lower resolution than the GMOS spectrum, but shows the [Oii]\nemission line as well as the much stronger H\u03b3 and H\u03b4 absorption\nlines. The SDSS spectra also covers the H\u03b1 emission line.\n\nFig. 1.- True colour gri image of SDSSJ 101345.39 from the SDSS\nimaging. Both panels show the GMOS-IFU field of view. The main\npanel has been thresholded to emphasise the low surface brightness\nmaterial outside the nucleus as well as the extension of material\nto the north, suggesting SDSSJ 101345.39 may have recently undergone an interaction. The inset is the same image but scales to\nemphasise the full range of surface brightness and shows that most\nof the stars are located inside the GMOS-IFU field of view. We have\nrotated this image to agree with the IFU observation, and so North\nis right and East is up.\n\n2.1. Imaging\nUsing the SDSS gri-band imaging we construct a true\ncolour image of SDSSJ 101345.39. Each image has an exposure time of 60 seconds and was obtained in \u223c1.2\u2032\u2032 seeing. The final images have a plate scale of 0.4\u2032\u2032 /pixel. The\nhigh surface brightness material in SDSSJ 101345.39 looks\nlike a bulge dominated galaxy, however the lower surface\nbrightness structure has a disturbed morphology (Fig. 1)\n1\n\n2.3. GMOS Spectroscopic Imaging\nNew observations of SDSSJ 101345.39 were taken with\nthe GMOS-South IFU in Nod & Shuffle mode on 2004\nFebruary 28th U.T. during science verification time for a\ntotal of 3 hours in 0.8\u2032\u2032 seeing and photometric conditions1 .\nUsing the Nod & Shuffle mode we chopped away from the\ntarget by 30\u2032\u2032 every 30 seconds. In this configuration the\nIFU uses a fiber fed system to reformat the 5\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 5\u2032\u2032 field\nonto two long slits. Using the B-band filter in conjunction\nwith the B600 grating results in two tiers of spectra being\nrecorded. The spectral resolution in this configuration is\n\u03bb/\u2206\u03bb \u223c1700. The [Oii](\u03bb\u03bb3726.1,3728.8\u00c5) emission line\nand H\u03b3 and H\u03b4 absorption features all fall in regions of\nlow sky emission and absorption.\nIn the Nod & Shuffle mode, the object and background\nregions are observed alternately through the same fibres\nby nodding the telescope. In between each observation\nthe charge is shuffled on the CCD by a number of rows\n\nBased on observations obtained at the Gemini Observatory, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy,\nInc., under a cooperative agreement with the NSF on behalf of the Gemini partnership: the National Science Foundation (United States),\nthe Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (United Kingdom), the National Research Council (Canada), CONICYT (Chile), the\nAustralian Research Council (Australia), CNPq (Brazil) and CONICET (Argentina).\n\n\fGMOS-IFU Spectroscopy of a Merging System with Enhanced Balmer Absorption\n\n3\n\nFig. 3.- Left: Continuum image generated from the datacube between 4900\u20135400\u00c5; Middle: continuum subtracted two dimensional [Oii]\nemission line map with the continuum from the left panel overlaid as contours. Right: continuum subtracted two dimensional (inverted)\nH\u03b3+H\u03b4 absorption line map with the continuum contours from the left panel overlaid. The circles in the top left hand corners of each panel\nrepresent the size of the seeing disk.\n\ncorresponding to the the centre-to-centre spacing of the\nblocks of 50 fibres into which each slit is divided. For the\nNod & Shuffle mode, each alternate block is masked off so\nthat it receives no light from the sky but acts simply as\nan image store. The slit to field mapping was arranged so\nthat the resultant half of the total object and background\nfield (7\"\u00d75\" + 3.5\"\u00d75\") formed a contiguous sub-field of\n5\"\u00d75\". Since each alternate block is masked, each exposure can be stored in different regions of the CCD without contamination from any other region of the sky. The\nsequence of object and background exposures can be repeated as often as desired with the photoelectrons from\neach exposure being stored in their own unique regions of\nthe detector. At the end of the sequence, the CCD is read,\nincurring a read-noise penalty only once (see Glazebrook\n& Bland-Hawthorn 2001) for further details of this general\napproach). For each fiber (and corresponding spectrum),\nwe identify the corresponding sky spectrum in the shuffled\nposition and subtract them to achieve Poisson\u2013limited sky\nsubtraction.\n\n4500\n\n5000\n\nFig.\n4.- The reduced, sky-subtracted spectrum of\nSDSS J101345.39, generated by collapsing the central two square\narcseconds of the galaxy. We have marked the strongest emission\nand absorption features. The hashed regions show the positions of\nthe GMOS chip gaps.\n\nThe GMOS data reduction pipeline was used to extract\nand wavelength calibrate the spectra of each IFU element.\nThe variations in fiber-to-fiber response were removed using twilight flat-fields and the wavelength calibration was\n\nachieved using a CuAr arc lamp. The wavelength coverage\nof the final data is 4080\u20135400\u00c5. No flux standards were\nobserved, as the spectral features of interest are narrow\nenough that the standard sensitivity is sufficient.\nSince the datacube has a large wavelength coverage we\ncorrect for the parallactic angle by modelling a 2-hour observation running from -1 to +1 hour angle and corresponding minimum and maximum airmasses of 1.17 and\n1.21. The average atmospheric dispersion between 400nm\nand 540nm is 0.67\" at an angle roughly North\u2013South. After building the datacube, we use idl to model and correct\nthis aberration using a linear interpolation at each slice of\nthe datacube along the wavelength axis.\nWe show the reduced, sky-subtracted spectrum, collapsed over the central two arcseconds of the galaxy in\nFig. 4 and identify the strongest features.\n3. results\n\n3.1. Spatial Light Distribution\nTo investigate the spatial distribution of the gas and\nstars in the galaxy we begin by extracting narrow-band\nslices from the datacube around the emission and absorption lines. We fit and subtract the continuum around the\nline of interest using a 3\u2013\u03c3 clip to be sure that neighbouring emission and absorption lines are omitted. We\nthen extract the narrow-band images from the datacube\nby collapsing each spectrum over the feature of interest.\nWe also extract the continuum regions by median filtering\neach spectral pixel in the datacube between 4900\u20135300\u00c5.\nIn Fig. 3 we show the spatial distribution of the relatively older stars (as traced by the continuum light between 4900\u00c5 and 5300\u00c5), the gas (as traced through the\n[Oii] emission line) and the young, massive stars (traced\nby the H\u03b3 and H\u03b4 absorption lines). Fig. 3 shows that,\nwhile both the [Oii] emission and Balmer absorption lines\nare extended, they do not have the same spatial distribution. In particular, the centroid of the [Oii] emission is\noffset \u223c 2 kpc to the SE from the older stars and the H\u03b4\nand H\u03b3 absorption lines.\nThis difference is shown in Fig. 5, where we split the\ndatacube into nine spatial bins. It is clear that the shape\nof the continuum is not constant across the galaxy. This is\n\n\f4\n\nSwinbank et al.\n\nFig. 5.- Spectra from nine spatial bins from the datacube split up according to the labels in Fig. 3. The dashed lines show the positions\nof the [Oii], H\u03b3 and H\u03b4 emission/absorption lines for a fixed redshift of z = 0.1055. The spectra which fall in the GMOS chip gaps have been\nmasked out. We also state the average [Oii] emission line velocity, (vem ) found by fitting the [Oii] emission line, as well as the absorption\nline velocity from the A- stars (vabs ) found by cross correlating each spectrum with an A2 stellar template (all velocities are in km s\u22121 ). The\nzero-point in the velocity is defined to be the rest-frame of the A-stars in the middle panel. The change in the shape of the continuum which\ngive rise to the colour gradients in Fig. 1 is reflected in the spectra.\n\nconfirmed by comparing with the colour gradients in the\nSDSS imaging. By binning the imaging data into 3 \u00d7 3\npixels (1.2\" \u00d7 1.2\" bins, matching the same spatial bins as\nin Fig. 5) we investigate the colour gradients across the\ngalaxy (which can be seen in the inset panel of Fig. 1). In\neach panel of Fig. 5 we show the corresponding g-r and u-r\ncolours determined from the SDSS imaging data. Both the\nspectroscopic and imaging data show the colour gradient\nacross the galaxy with panels [1,2&4],[3,5&7] and [6,8&9]\nhaving average g-r colours of 0.31 \u00b1 0.06,0.48 \u00b1 0.06 and\n\n0.54 \u00b1 0.07 and u-r colours of 2.28 \u00b1 0.10, 2.41 \u00b1 0.10 and\n2.42 \u00b1 0.09 respectively confirming that changing shape of\nthe continuum seen in the IFU data is real and not simply\nan artifact of the observations.\nThe spatial distribution of the young OB stars, as traced\nby the rest-frame UV continuum, is consistent with that\nof the [Oii] emission, and offset by >\n\u223c2 kpc in projection\nfrom the older stellar population (indicated also by the\ncolour gradient in the imaging). The colour gradient is\nin approximately the same direction as the surface bright-\n\n\fGMOS-IFU Spectroscopy of a Merging System with Enhanced Balmer Absorption\nness asymmetry, and suggests that the galaxy consists of\nat least two components, possibly as the result of a recent\nmerger.\n3.2. Emission Line Dynamics\nTo investigate the dynamics in more detail we return to\nthe datacube and fit the emission and absorption lines on\na pixel-by-pixel basis. The [Oii] emission line doublet and\nunderlying (rest frame UV) continuum was fitted using a\n\u03c72 minimisation procedure. The spectra were averaged\nover a 3 \u00d7 3 spatial pixel region, except where the signal\nwas too low to give a significant detection of the line, in\nwhich case the smoothing area was increased to 4 \u00d7 4 pixels. In regions where this averaging process still failed to\ngive an adequate \u03c72 (i.e. the inclusion of an emission line\ncomponent does not improve the fit), no fit was made. We\nrequired a minimum \u03c72 of 25 (S/N of 5) to detect the line,\nand allow the signal to drop by a \u03c72 of 9 to calculate the\nerror in the velocity. This corresponds to a formal 3\u03c3 error. In Fig. 6 we show the [Oii] velocity structure. This\nshows a velocity shear of 100 \u00b1 20 km s\u22121 across \u223c6 kpc in\nprojection . The velocity field of the gas does not resemble\nthat of a disk. However, if one of the progenitors was a gas\nrich disk, then the observed shear may be arise due residual motion of a gas disk following a merger. Assuming\nthis is the case, we estimate that the mass of the gas-rich\nprogenitor was (M = v 2 r/G) \u223c1.2\u00d71010M\u2299 . This mass\nestimate should be viewed as a lower limit to the progenitors mass since we may be seeing only a residual part of\nthe motion that the disk had before the encounter.\n\nFig. 6.- Left: The UV continuum intensity (colour scale) with\nthe continuum from the older stellar population overlaid as contours. Right: Two dimensional velocity field of the galaxy derived\nfrom the [Oii] emission line. The galaxy shows a shear across the\ngalaxy with peak-to-peak velocity difference of 100 \u00b1 20 km s\u22121 .\n\n3.3. A-type stars\nTo investigate the EWs of the short-lived A- stars we\nturn to the H\u03b3 and H\u03b4 absorption lines. Using a similar\nprocedure as used to fit the [Oii] emission features we simultaneously fit the H\u03b3 and H\u03b4 absorption features (with\na fixed separation but variable intensity and width) and\nshow the resulting two dimensional distribution of EWs in\nFig. 7. We estimate the 1\u2013\u03c3 uncertainties by perturbing all\nof the parameters of the best fit such that \u2206\u03c72 = 1. From\nthe distribution of EWs it is clear that the A- star population is most prominent at the same location as the old\nstellar population, but also has a large contribution near\n\n5\n\nthe peak in the [Oii] distribution. Whilst the two peaks\nin the distribution of EWs in the galaxy are statistically\nsignificant, we note that systematic uncertainties such as\nemission line filling of the H\u03b3 and H\u03b4 absorption lines may\ncause the EW to appear artificially low. We therefore attach little significance to the 'double peaked' distribution\nof EWs, but rather note that the distribution of A-stars in\nthe galaxy is widespread. This is particularly important\nfor understanding the formation of the A-star population\nsince it suggests that the A-stars are not formed from gas\nfunnelled into the nucleus but rather from material which\nis much more widespread.\n\nFig. 7.- Two dimensional map of the equivalent widths of the\nH\u03b4+H\u03b3 absorption lines. This shows two peaks in the EWs, one\nat the peak location of the old stellar population, and one at the\npeak location of the younger OB stellar population. The contours\nare spaced by 1\u2013\u03c3 found by varying the fit such that \u2206\u03c72 = 1.\n\nTo obtain the velocity structure of the A-type stars, the\nspectra from the 9 spatial bins in Fig. 5 are cross-correlated\nwith a template star of type A2V. The absorption line\nvelocities in individual panels are shown in Fig. 5, with\nthe zero-point defined such that the A-stars in the middle\npanel have zero velocity. The A-stars velocity field appears to have a \u223c 40 km s\u22121 shear in the same direction of\nthe gas, although the lines have a greater intrinsic width\nand therefore the large error bars preclude any stronger\nconclusion.\nWe can obtain an estimate of the age of the A-star population by comparing the average galaxy spectrum with the\nspectral library of Jacoby et al. (1984). The strength of\nthe K-line at \u223c 3932\u00c5 is especially sensitive to the spectral type of the early A-type stars (Rose 1985). Based\non the relative strength of the K-line and the neighbouring H+H\u01eb line at \u223c 3970\u00c5 the galaxy spectrum best resembles that of an A2\u00b11 star (hence the choice of the\nA2 stellar template for cross correlation above). Taking the effective temperature of an A2 dwarf to be 9100\nK (di Benedetto 1998), and interpolating the theoretical\nisochrones of Bertelli et al. (1994) we arrive at an estimate\nof 0.44 Gyr for a MS turnoff at A2. Likewise, the ages for\nA1 and A3 dwarfs are estimated to be 0.39 and 0.47 Gyr\nrespectively although stellar mixes and metallicity makes\nthis estimate uncertain.\n4. discussion and conclusions\n\n\f6\n\nSwinbank et al.\n\nWe have selected one field galaxy from the SDSS which\nshows strong Balmer absorption lines (which are indicative\nof a strong A- star population), but has only a small ongoing star-formation rate. In this pilot study, we have\ndemonstrated the ability of IFU observations to disentangle the spatial and velocity distributions of the stellar\nand gaseous components through the measurement of both\nemission and absorption features.\nThe main results are summarised as follows:\n1. The SDSS images show a bright nucleus and more\ndiffuse material distributed asymmetrically toward\nthe north (Fig. 1). The disturbed morphology of\nthe field galaxy SDSSJ 101345.39 is suggestive of\nan interaction (or merger) between two galaxies.\n2. The continuum from the older stellar population\nis spatially offset by \u223c2 kpc from the young, hot\nOB stars (traced from the rest-frame UV continuum) and is easily seen from the changing shape of\nthe continuum across the spatial domain of the datacube in the IFU observation (Fig. 5). This colour\ngradient is also reflected by the strong colour gradient seen in the SDSS imaging.\n3. By extracting narrow-band slices of the emission\nand absorption lines in the the GMOS IFU datacube, we find that the gas (traced through the [Oii]\nemission line) is spatially extended with an elongated morphology, approximately coincident with\nthe young, hot, OB star population (Fig. 3).\n4. The H\u03b3 and H\u03b4 absorption lines are widely distributed (Fig. 3). The peaks of these absorption\nlines are spatially co-incident with the older stellar\npopulation and the centre of the gas. The A-star\npopulation are not confined to the nuclear regions.\nTheir spatial distribution is different from that of\nthe [Oii] emission, but the two appear related.\n5. The gas has a velocity shear of 100 \u00b1 20 km s\u22121\nacross 6 kpc in projection (Fig. 6), but the velocity field does not resemble that of a disk. However,\nassuming that the velocity shear arises due to residual motion of a gas disk which has been disturbed\nas the result of an interaction, we estimate that\nthe gas rich progenitor had a dynamical mass of at\nleast \u223c 1.2 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 . This mass estimate should\nbe viewed as a lower limit since some of the angular momentum of the gas-rich progenitor may have\nbeen lost during the interaction.\n6. The A-stars do not show the same amplitude of\nvelocity motion as the gas, however, there is evidence of a 40 km s\u22121 shear in approximately the\nsame direction as the velocity motion of the gas\n(although the large error bars preclude any strong\nconclusions).\nOur observations suggest that the activity in\nSDSS J102145.39 may be the result of a strong tidal interaction between a passive (possibly elliptical) galaxy\n(giving rise to the old stellar population), and a gas-rich,\nstar-forming (spiral or irregular?) galaxy (giving rise to\n\nthe spatially offset of hot stars and nebular emission).\nThe interaction between the two components is likely to\nhave been responsible for the production of the A-star\npopulation in a burst of star formation.\nBy comparing the galaxy spectrum with spectral libraries and stellar population models (Jocoby et al. 1984,\nVazdekis & Arimoto 1999) we estimate an burst age of\n\u223c0.5Gyr although we caution that systematic uncertainties such as hidden emission, differing metallicities and\npollution of K- type stars make this estimate uncertain.\nUnfortunately the wavelength coverage of our GMOS data\ndo not extend to Mgii or H\u03b1, making it difficult to constrain the underlying old population or dust absorption.\nFuture observations at these wavelengths would allow us\nto trace the dynamics and metallicities of the old stars and\nfurther constrain the burst age, as well as locate the position of any possible AGN (which may be important for\nunderstanding black hole growth in these galaxies).\nWe can estimate the mass of the underlying old population from the K-band magnitude (K=13.2+/-0.001,\nBalogh et al. 2004) and assuming a canonical value of\n1.0 for the stellar mass-to-light ratio (Bruzual & Charlot 2003). We estimate that the total stellar mass is\n\u223c 2 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 . It is interesting to contrast this with\nthe mass of the young A-star population, and the current\nstar formation rate. If we assume a Salpeter IMF (Salpeter\n1955), we can estimate the mass of the burst population\nby comparing the equivalent width of H\u03b4 (7.5\u00c5) with the\nmodels of Shioya et al. (2004). In order to produce absorption of this strength, their models require a burst population of at least \u223c 10% by mass (ie., \u223c 2 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 ).\nWe note that this agrees well with the lower limit on the\ndynamical mass that we estimated from the velocity shear\nin the [Oii] emission (we note that it is difficult to place\nan upper limit on the mass of the gas rich progenitor). If\nthe burst mass fraction was skewed towards higher mass\nstars, the burst mass could be a factor \u223c 3 lower. The\ncurrent residual star formation rate inferred from the [Oii]\nflux is \u223c 0.5 \u00b1 0.1 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (Kennicutt 1998), so that in\n0.5Gyr, a mass of only \u223c 2 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 would be converted\ninto stars. Thus it seems that the residual star formation\nis at least 1/100th of the rate during the burst, while the\nmass involved in the burst is about 1/10th of the mass of\nthe old stellar population.\nThe spectra, morphological information and kinematics\nof SDSSJ 121345.39 appears very similar to local field E+A\ngalaxy NGC 2865 (Hau, Carter and Balcells 1999) in which\na 0.4\u20131.2Gyr old burst has occurred due to the merger of a\ngas-rich (Sb or Sc) spiral and an elliptical galaxy. A quantitative discussion of the star-formation truncation mechanism will have to wait until we have a statistically significant sample, but we can outline the possibilities which\ncause this process. Competing models for E+A galaxy formation predict very different distributions of stellar populations following the interaction. In SPH simulations for\nmergers between spiral and elliptical galaxies the gas tends\nto sink to the galaxy centre on timescales much less than\nthe starburst duration, and therefore suggest that the gas\nand A-stars should be centrally concentrated and segregated away from the older stellar population (e.g., Hernquist & Weil 1992) (although these models do not take into\naccount the hot ISM in the elliptical). However, other\n\n\fGMOS-IFU Spectroscopy of a Merging System with Enhanced Balmer Absorption\nmodels suggest that the gas in the progenitor should be\nclumpy (in molecular clouds) rather than distributed as a\nsmooth medium, and the result of the merger is to scatter\nthese star forming regions across the galaxy (compressing/squeezing the gas and causing the A-star starburst as\nthe interaction occurs). As the gas clouds scatter either in\nthe spiral arms of the progenitor or in the new ICM, they\nevaporate and the star formation is truncated as the density of the clouds falls (eg.Mahos & Hernquist, 1996, Kojima & Noguchi 1997). In our pilot study we have shown\nthat the A-stars are widely distributed across the galaxy,\nwhich coupled with the spatially extended morphology of\nthe gas suggests a clear preference for the latter model.\nAlthough these observations show a clear preference for\nthe squeezed cloud model it is not yet clear that this is true\n\n7\n\nfor the H\u03b4S galaxy population as a whole. The next step\nis to generate a statistically useful sample of such galaxies,\nin a variety of environments, to be able to generalise our\nconclusions and investigate the star-formation rate of the\npresent day Universe. This is important for constraining\ncurrent models for galaxy formation in which these H\u03b4S\ngalaxies may represent an important phase in the evolution of todays local luminous spheroidal galaxies.\nWe are very grateful to the Gemini Staff for accepting this programme for Science Verification Time.
