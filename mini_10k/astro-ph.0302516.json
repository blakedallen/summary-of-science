Introduction\nRecent Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of\nO stars show resolved X-ray emission line profiles from\nH- and He-like ions. The line profiles observed exhibit\na variety of shapes: (1) the stars \u03b81 Ori C (Schulz et\nal. 2000) and \u03b6 Ori (Waldron & Cassinelli 2001) show\nstrongly wind-broadened, symmetric, and nonshifted profiles; (2) \u03b4 Ori A (Miller et al. 2002) and \u03c4 Sco (Mewe\net al. 2003) display weakly or nonbroadened, symmetric,\nand nonshifted profiles; (3) \u03b6 Pup (Cassinelli et al. 2001;\nKahn et al. 2001) shows strongly broadened, asymmetric,\nand blueshifted profiles.\nStrong wind-broadening should be a consequence of\nthe lines forming in the fast wind. Furthermore, symmetric and nonshifted profiles indicate line formation in an extended and optically thin wind, whereas asymmetric and\nblueshifted profiles indicate line formation in a dense wind,\nwhere X-rays from the stellar back hemisphere (with respect to the observer) are more strongly absorbed by cool\nintervening wind gas than X-rays from the front hemisphere. The most puzzling result of the above observations is that a putatively dense wind like \u03b6 Ori's shows\nline profiles suggestive of an optically thin wind.\nIn order to gain a better understanding of the above\nobservations, we address X-ray emission line formation in\na structured stellar wind with thin, aligned absorbing layers. We consider a wind consisting of very dense, discrete\nfragments of gas shells that float through essentially empty\nspace and are oriented perpendicular to the radial flow\ndirection. Such a hydrodynamic structure seems plausible for radial wind flows reaching Mach numbers of 100\nSend offprint requests to: A. Feldmeier\n\nand being subject to strong perturbations. Radiative postshock cooling zones should lead here to highly compressed,\nthin gas sheets lying perpendicular to the flow direction.\nMore specifically, a wind with oriented absorber layers could result from the combined action of the line deshadowing instability, photospheric turbulence, and the\nRayleigh-Taylor instability. The line deshadowing instability compresses the initially homogeneous gas flow from\nthe photosphere into thin, highly overdense shells (Owocki\net al. 1988). In linear approximation, the line deshadowing\ninstability has no lateral component (Rybicki et al. 1990),\nand the resulting flow structure obeys spherical symmetry,\ni.e. is shell-like. However, turbulence-induced velocity fluctuations at the wind base lead to significant differences in\nthe spacing of flow structure (shocks and dense gas shells)\nalong neighboring wind rays. Therefore, dense gas patches\nform instead of extended shells. The Rayleigh-Taylor instability should further fragment these patches.\nWe neglect lateral motions (e.g. eddies), and assume\npurely radial flow. The flow shall obey spherical symmetry\nin the statistical sense, i.e., the spatial distribution of fragments depends on radius, but not on latitude or azimuth.\nIn the first part of the present paper, the fragments are\nassumed to be fully opaque. This assumption is dropped\nin the second part.\nX-ray emission originates from shocks associated with\nthe dense fragments. Hydrodynamic simulations show that\nthe shocks occur almost exclusively on the inner, starward facing side of the fragments, i.e. are reverse shocks\n(Owocki et al. 1988). To remain general, however, we leave\nit open whether strong forward shocks occur on the outer\nfragment faces, too (Lucy 1982).\n\n\f2\n\nA. Feldmeier et al.: X-ray line emission from a fragmented stellar wind\n\n2. Wind model\n2.1. Assumptions\nAlong the lines of this general description, we set up an\nidealized stellar wind with highly compressed gas fragments oriented perpendicular to the radial flow direction,\nmaking the following assumptions:\n(1) The gas flow is purely radial, and the radial wind speed\nv(r) = v\u221e is constant.\n(2) No gas resides outside an outer atmospheric radius\nr = 1. Inside a radius \u01eb \u226a 1, the optical depth is infinite\ndue to the presence of the central star and dense gas above\nthe photosphere.\n(3) Between radii \u01eb and 1, all absorbing wind gas resides\nin 2-D absorbers of high density, termed fragments, that\nare oriented perpendicular to the radial flow direction.\n(4) The opening angle of an individual fragment as seen\nfrom the star is infinitesimal and independent of r.\n(5) The fragments are uniformly random distributed as\nfunction of the spherical coordinates r, \u03b8, and \u03c6.\n(6) On average, N fragments occur along each radial ray.\n(7) Each fragment is fully opaque. (This assumption will\nbe dropped in Sect. 4.)\n(8) X-rays are emitted from within a sphere of radius x \u2264\n1, with the emissivity scaling as \u03b7 \u223c r\u22122m , where typically\nm = 2 (emission \u223c density squared). There is no X-ray\nreemission by the absorbing fragments.\nAssumptions (1) and (2) are chosen for calculational\nsimplicity. The present paper focuses on qualitative aspects of X-ray line formation, and future work shall deal\nwith quantitative modelling of line profiles. Assumption\n(3) is the crucial one, of a wind with oriented absorber\nfragments. Consistent with assumption (1), the fragments partake in the radial wind expansion (assumption 4) and have uniform radial distribution (assumption\n5). Assumption (6) will be discussed in Sect. 2.2 below.\nAssumption (7) is chosen to derive a principal limiting\ncase, and will be dropped in Sect. 4. Assumption (8) accounts for the fact that the X-ray emitting region may be\nsmaller than the region containing absorbing fragments.\nFigure 1 shows a sketch of this fragmented wind model.\n\n2.2. Photon escape\nWe discuss assumption (6) and its relation to the total\nradial wind optical depth. The 4\u03c0 solid angle as seen from\nthe star is covered N times by absorbing fragments. One\nmay wonder how photons can escape from an atmosphere\nwith N -fold coverage by opaque absorbers. This is due to\ntwo effects, lateral absorber randomization and sphericity.\nLateral randomization. One easily proofs that covering an\narbitrary planar surface of area A with N thin layers of\nopaque absorbing material, then cutting each of the layers into small pieces and distributing the latter randomly\nand uniformly within A, an area Ae\u2212N is left empty of\nabsorbers. Therefore, photons crossing through A experi-\n\nFig. 1. Fragmented wind, with N = 10 fragments per radial ray. The symbols in brackets designate radii.\n\nFig. 2. Photon escape chanels for N = 3. The dotted\nlines indicate where dense shells got fragmented. The lines\ndrawn parallel to the z axis indicate photon escape chanels\ntowards the observer.\n\nence an optical depth \u03c4 = N . For such a laterally randomized absorber distribution, there are still on average\nN absorbers along each ray crossing through A, as is specified in assumption (6) above.\nSphericity. We sharpen for the moment assumption (6)\nto the condition that there are exactly N fragments along\neach radial ray. This would be the case if the flow is purely\nradial, without any lateral motions, as is indicated in\nFig. 2. Despite the N -fold coverage, photon escape chanels\noccur like the ones shown in the figure.\nTaking assumption (1) of purely radial flow at face\nvalue, photons could only escape via sphericity. All central\nrays from the origin r = \u01eb, p \u2192 0 encounter N opaque fragments, and the optical depth is \u221e, not N . In the present\npaper we do not interpret (1) in this strict sense, but assume that lateral fragment randomization has occured.\nThis is partly justified by noting that the random radial\ndistribution of fragments specified in assumption (5) appears as lateral randomization when viewed under an angle \u03b8. In summary, assumptions (6) and (7) fix the total\noptical depth in radial direction at N .\n\n\fA. Feldmeier et al.: X-ray line emission from a fragmented stellar wind\n\nFig. 3. Basic geometry in the wind.\n\n3. Opaque fragments\n3.1. Optical depth in fragmented wind\nTo calculate the optical depth in radial direction for the\nfragmented wind, consider an arbitrary radius r, infinitesimal radial increment \u03b4r, and an area element A of arbitrary shape that is oriented perpendicular to the radial\ndirection. A shall be much larger than the average local\nfragment area. The radial optical depth increment is (note,\nr = 1 at the atmospheric rim),\n\u03b4\u03c4r =\n\n\u03b4Ab\nN A \u03b4r\n=\n\u2248 N \u03b4r,\nA\nA(1 \u2212 \u01eb)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b4Ab is the area of opaque atomic absorbers in the\nvolume A \u03b4r. From Eq. (1), the total radial optical depth\nbetween \u01eb and 1 is N , in agreement with the foregoing\nsection. We drop from now on \u01eb in nonsingular expressions,\nstill using equation signs, i.e. \u01eb \u2192 0 is assumed.\nThe observer shall be located at z = \u221e in standard\npz coordinates. Introducing the direction cosine \u03bc = r * z\nwith unity vectors r and z, one has vz = \u03bcvr and \u03b4z =\n\u03b4r/\u03bc, see Fig. 3. The optical depth increment for a photon\npropagating in z direction is,\n\u03b4\u03c4z = N \u03b4z \u03bc = N \u03b4r.\n\n(2)\n\nThe factor \u03bc accounts for the reduction in optical depth\ncaused by the foreshortening of the fragment area in photon propagation direction. Note that this is equivalent to\nan angle-dependent opacity\n\u03c7 = \u03bcN.\n\n(3)\n\nAnother way to look at Eq. (2) is that, for a given pathway\n\u03b4z, N \u03b4r is the average number of fragment hits (assuming a uniform fragment distribution), which is precisely\nthe definition of the optical depth increment. This is elaborated upon in the appendix. The total optical depth,\n\u03c4 (r, \u03bc), from an X-ray emission site specified by coordinates r and \u03bc to the outer\np boundary of the atmosphere\nalong the p ray with p = r 1 \u2212 \u03bc2 is therefore simply the\ndifference of the respective radii r at these two locations,\n(\nN (1 \u2212 r)\nif \u03bc > 0,\n\u03c4 (r, \u03bc) =\n(4)\nN (1 + r \u2212 2p) if \u03bc < 0.\n\n3\n\nWe neglect obscuration due to the central region of radius\n\u01eb, which is easy to include in a numerical code but would\ncause lengthy case distinctions in the present equations.\nThe conclusion is that \u03c4 (r, \u03bc) is independent of p =\np(r, \u03bc) and therefore of \u03bc if \u03bc > 0, i.e. for the blue part\nof the line profile forming in gas that moves towards the\nobserver. Therefore, the optical depth is the same for all\nphotons that originate on the surface of a given front hemisphere. The reason is that \u03c4 is the expectation value of the\nnumber of fragment hits between the emission site and\nthe outer boundary of the atmosphere. Since the spatial\ndistribution of fragments depends neither on latitude nor\nazimuth, one can arrange them, on average, to spherical\nshells. The same number of shells, N (1 \u2212 r), is crossed by\neach p ray that starts on the hemisphere with radius r.\nFor \u03bc < 0, on the other hand, i.e. the red part of the profile, the number of shells crossed is N (r \u2212 p) on the back\nhemisphere, and N (1 \u2212 p) on the front hemisphere, giving\nin total \u03c4 (r, \u03bc < 0) = N (1 + r \u2212 2p) as in Eq. (4).\n\n3.2. Optical depth in homogeneous wind\nWe compare the above expressions for \u03c4 with those in\nhomogeneous wind. The fragments consist of atomic absorbers of cross section \u03c30 that have number density n0 /r2\nin the homogeneous wind in which the fragments form\n(v = v\u221e ; and we chose a reference radius r0 = 1).\nThe total optical depth\nR 1of the homogeneous wind in radial direction is t = \u01eb \u03c30 n(r)dr. In the limit \u01eb \u2192 0,\nt = \u03c30 n0 /\u01eb, using equation signs if errors of order \u01eb\nare made. The optical depth increment in z direction is\n\u03b4\u03c4z = \u03c30 n(r) \u03b4z = t\u01eb\u03b4z/r2 . Note that for isotropic absorbers, no \u03bc factor occurs here in contrast to Eq.

X-ray line profiles for opaque fragments\nWe turn to X-ray line formation in a dense wind with\nabsorption. For constant radial wind speed v(r) = v\u221e ,\nthe surfaces of constant projected velocity \u03bcv as seen by\nan observer at infinity are straight cones of opening angle\nacos \u03bc. The emergent line profile is given by\nZ x\nF\u03bce \u223c\ndr r2 \u03b7(r) e\u2212\u03c4 (r,\u03bc) ,\n(7)\n\u01eb\n\nwith \u03c4 (r, \u03bc) from Eqs. (4) or (6). Only \u03c4 depends on \u03bc,\ni.e. refers to the explicit cone considered. Since \u03c4 (r, \u03bc) from\nEq. (4) is independent of \u03bc for \u03bc > 0, the blue part of the\nline profile from the fragmented wind remains flat-topped,\ndespite absorption. This is not true for the homogeneous\nwind. All photons emitted from the surface of a given front\nhemisphere are diminished by the same optical depth (the\nfragment hit expectation value), hence the emission line\nprofile stays flat-topped even after severe absorption. Note\nthat in a wind with nonconstant outflow speed, the flattopped profiles from individual emitting spheres of radius\nr have different widths [\u2212v(r), +v(r)] in velocity space,\nhence the sum of individual line profiles is no longer a\nflat-topped profile.\nWe repeat the physical argument for flat-topped\nblueshifted parts of line profiles despite wind absorption:\ndivide the X-ray emitting volume into spherical layers of\ninfinitesimal thickness. If the wind would be optically thin,\nthe line emission from each of these shells would show a\nflat-topped profile. Consider the front hemisphere towards\nthe observer where the blueshifted component of the profile forms. Because the distribution of absorbing fragments\nobeys spherical symmetry, one can arrange them, on average, on spherical shells (with uniformly distributed holes).\nTherefore, all photons reaching the observer at infinity\nfrom a given radius r in the front hemisphere encounter, on\naverage, the same number of absorber fragments, i.e. experience the same optical depth. Hence, the blue part of\nthe profile remains flat.\nFigure 4 shows line profiles from the fragmented and,\nfor comparison, from the homogeneous wind. The latter shows the well-known red-blue asymmetry, with a\nrather uniform decline from the blue to the red line wing\n(MacFarlane et al. 1991; Ignace 2001; Owocki & Cohen\n2001). By contrast, the profile for the fragmented wind is\nalmost a step function, namely flat-topped over the whole\nblueshifted part, and with steep decline to zero intensity\non the redshifted part. We suggest that such a profile, after\nconvolution with the detector response function, resembles the blueshifted yet symmetric emission line profiles\nobserved from \u03b6 Pup, see Fig. 3 in Cassinelli et al. (2001).\nBy the same token, its blueshift is too large to be reconcilable with \u03b6 Ori's observed emission lines. For Chandra and\n\nFig. 4. X-ray emission line profiles. Full: fragmented\nwind with opaque absorbers; dotted: homogeneous wind.\nParameters are: N = 10 dense fragments per radial ray;\ninner atmospheric radius \u01eb = 0.1; termination radius x = 1\nfor X-ray emission; radial optical depth t = 3 of the homogeneous wind. The abscissa is in units of the projected,\nnormalized wind speed, \u03bc = vz /v\u221e .\nXMM-Newton, the line center frequency can be measured\nwith an accuracy of roughly 5 m\u00c5, which corresponds to\n\u03b4v/v\u221e \u2248 0.06 at 1 keV, assuming c/v\u221e = 150. This is\nalmost one order of magnitude smaller than the blueshift\n\u03b4v/v\u221e \u2248 0.5 in Fig. 4.\nAs a conclusion from this section, observed X-ray line\nprofiles of \u03b6 Pup and \u03b6 Ori are qualitatively different. Our\nmodel of a fragmented stellar wind can only explain the\nformer.\n\n4. Nonopaque fragments\n4.1. Fragment optical depth\nWe drop now assumption (7), and account for the finite\noptical depth of fragments. The latter shall form close to\nthe photosphere in a rather uniform process, and therefore\ncontain roughly the same number of atoms. The radial optical depth of a fragment is the absorber area per fragment\narea, \u03c30 n0 /N r2 or t\u01eb/N r2 . In the limit 1/N \u2261 dr \u2192 0 of\ninfinitely many, optically thin fragments, the integral over\ndr gives t, as must be. On the other hand, for a finite\nnumber N of optically thick fragments, the expression for\nthe total radial optical depth becomes,\ntf =\n\nZ\n\n\u01eb\n\n1\n\n\u0014\n\ndr N 1 \u2212 exp\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2212t\u01eb\nN r2\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\n.\n\n(8)\n\nThis is derived in Eq. (A.6) of the appendix, but is also\nintuitively clear: the integrand is the product of the hit expectation value of a fragment \u2013 which is the optical depth\nincrement for opaque fragments, see Eq. (1) \u2013 times the\ntransmission probability for nonopaque fragments. For a\nlarge number of optically thin fragments, N \u2192 \u221e, the\nexponential can be Taylor-series expanded to first order,\ngiving again tf = t. In the opposite limit of opaque fragments, the exponential term is dropped, giving tf = N as\n\n\fA. Feldmeier et al.: X-ray line emission from a fragmented stellar wind\n\n5\n\nin Sect. 2.2. Turning to moderately optically thick fragments, we shift the lower integration bound in Eq. (8) to\n0 and make a variable substitution y = 1/r. Integrating\nby parts,\n\u221a \u0001\n\u221a\n(9)\ntf /N = 1 \u2212 e\u2212a + a\u03c0 1 \u2212 erf a ,\n\nRx\n2\nwhere a = t\u01eb/N and erf x = 2\u03c0 \u22121/2 0 e\u2212t dt. The average\noptical depth per fragment is tf /N = 0.17 for a = 0.01\n(optically thin fragments), is 0.46 for a = 0.1, and is 0.91\nfor a = 1 (tf /N = 1 for opaque fragments).\nCassinelli & Olson (1979) and Hillier et al. (1993) estimate that the total radial optical depth of the wind of\n\u03b6 Pup could reach 30 at 1 keV. Time-dependent hydrodynamical simulations of O star winds suggest that there are\nof order 10 dense shells. Assuming, then, t = 30, N = 10,\nand \u01eb = 0.1, one has t\u01eb/N = 0.3. Around this value of\nt\u01eb/N , the line profile shape starts to resemble the profile\nfrom opaque fragments, see Figs. 5 and 6. We must thus\nconclude that assumption (7) of opaque fragments is only\napplicable for rather dense winds.\n\n4.2. X-ray lines profiles for nonopaque fragments\nAccording to the above, the optical depth \u03c4r\u03bc of a single\nfragment located at radius r, with direction cosine \u03bc, is\n\u03c4r\u03bc =\n\nt\u01eb\nN r2 \u03bc\n\n(10)\n\nin z direction. Here, \u03bc accounts for the longer pathway\nthrough the fragment when seen under an angle \u03b8. The\nformal integral for the line profile shape becomes\nZ x\nF\u03bce \u223c\ndr r2 \u03b7(r) e\u2212\u03c4 (r,\u03bc) ,\n\u01eb\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\nZ 1\n\u2212t\u01eb\n.\n(11)\n\u03c4 (r, \u03bc) =\ndr\u2032 N 1 \u2212 exp\nN r\u20322 \u03bc\u2032\nr\nThis cannot be solved analytically, but is easily evaluated\nnumerically.\nFigure 5 shows X-ray line profiles at different values of\nthe wind optical depth t. From Eq. (8), assumption (7)\nof opaque fragments holds if t\u01eb/N & 1. In accordance\nwith this, the line profile in the bottom panel of Fig. 5,\nat t\u01eb/N = 10, resembles that for fully opaque fragments\nfrom Fig. 4. The same is essentially true for the second\npanel from bottom, at t\u01eb/N = 1. At smaller t, however,\nthe profiles for the fragmented and homogeneous wind become similar, as is seen in the two top panels of the figure.\nAt present it is not clear, which fraction of intrinsic\nX-rays become visible as emergent X-rays. For O stars,\nthe latter typically amount to 10\u22127 L, with bolometric\nluminosity L (Sciortino et al. 1990). The wind kinetic\nenergy, on the other hand, which is the ultimate reservoir for X-ray energy via thermalization of macroscopic\nflow energy into heat by shocks, comprises for Lv\u221e /2c or\n10\u22123 \u2212 10\u22122 L if the wind is close to the single-scattering\nlimit, L/c \u2248 \u1e40 v\u221e , and if v\u221e . c/100. Therefore, there\n\nFig. 5. Normalized X-ray emission line profiles from winds\nwith increasing optical depth (top: optically thin; bottom:\nvery optically thick).

The models shown in Fig. 5 all lie within this\nmargin.\n\n4.3. Size of X-ray emitting region\nHydrodynamic simulations show that shock-compressed,\nabsorbing fragments significantly reexpand above \u2248 30 R\u2217\ndue to internal pressure, and the wind gradually becomes\nhomogeneous again. On the other hand, X-ray emitting\n\n\f6\n\nA. Feldmeier et al.: X-ray line emission from a fragmented stellar wind\n\nFig. 6. Similar to Fig. 5, but with smaller X-ray emitting\nvolume, x = 0.3. Still N = 10, \u01eb = 0.1.\nshocks (e.g. as caused by collisions of fast wind clouds\nwith fragments) may only reach out to 10 R\u2217 , suggesting\nx = 0.3 in assumption (8).\nFigure 6 shows line profiles for this value of x. The major differences when compared to Fig. 5 are: (i) the decline\non the red part of the profile is more gradual now; (ii) the\nblue part of line profiles from the fragmented wind starts\nto become flat-topped at t\u01eb/N & 0.1 already; (iii) for the\nhomogeneous wind at t\u01eb/N = 1, the ratio of emergent to\nintrinsic X-rays is very small, 4 \u00d7 10\u221214 .\n\n4.4. Natal fragment absorption\nWe assumed so far that X-rays originate from homogeneous emission within a sphere of radius x. Instead, Xray emission may spatially coincide with the oriented, ab-\n\nsorbing fragments. The line deshadowing instability is expected to form strong, X-ray emitting shocks that cool radiatively, leading to highly compressed fragments of cool,\nabsorbing wind gas. If the radiative cooling zone is narrow, one can think of both X-ray emission and absorption\noccuring in the same, spherical segments. The shocks are\nof the braking type, i.e. are reverse shocks on the starward\nfacing side of fragments. X-ray emitters on the front hemisphere, \u03bc > 0, are then hidden behind their natal fragment, whereas emitters on the back hemisphere are not.\nTo treat natal fragment absorption, we have to account for\nthe finite optical depth of fragments, since else the whole\nblueshifted part of the line profile would turn black. For\nphotons from the back hemisphere, we use \u03c4 (r, \u03bc) from\nEq. (11) in the formal integral, however with N dr replaced\nby (N \u2212 1) dr because the natal shell is not hit. For photons emitted from the front hemisphere, \u03c4 (r, \u03bc) is replaced\nby \u03c4 (r, \u03bc) + \u03c4r\u03bc , with \u03c4r\u03bc the optical depth of the natal\nfragment from Eq. (10). In Eq. (11), N dr \u2192 (N \u2212 1) dr\nagain, to avoid double counting the optical depth of the\nnatal shell.\nFigure 7 shows the resulting line profiles. Since \u03c4r\u03bc\nfrom Eq. (10) becomes infinite at \u03bc = 0, the center of the\nprofile from the optically thick, fragmented wind is black.\nThis kind of double-peaked X-ray emission line profile is\nnot observed. The resolution of the Chandra and XMMNewton gratings is sufficiently high as to resolve such a\nprofile shape.\nWe are drawn to conclude that either forward shocks\nexist of a strength similar to that of the reverse shocks,\nand prevent the drop to zero intensity; or that the assumption of spatial proximity of X-ray emitters and absorbers\nin 2-D, oriented fragments is too strong. The former alternative seems unlikely; the latter is rather plausible, given\nthat both lateral motions (eddies) and a finite extent of radiative cooling zones could prevent emitters at \u03bc \u2265 0 from\nbeing hidden behind their natal fragment. Therefore, a\nhomogeneous distribution of X-ray emitters as in assumption (8) seems more appropriate than a strict coincidence\nof emitters and absorbers in 2-D, oriented fragments.\n\n5. Summary\nWe consider X-ray emission line formation in a spherically symmetric stellar wind with constant radial outflow\nspeed. X-rays are assumed to originate from hot gas within\na sphere of radius x. Cool, absorbing wind gas resides\nin flat, highly overdense fragments that are oriented perpendicular to the radial flow direction. The fragments are\nthought to result from radial fragmentation of compressed\ngas shells that form due to the line deshadowing instability. The fragments have infinitesimal opening angle, a uniform spatial distribution, and partake in radial expansion.\nOur results are:\n1. For opaque fragments, the blueshifted part of the\nline profile is flat-topped, even after strong absorption,\nwhereas the redshifted part drops steeply to zero. The\noverall profile is therefore essentially flat-topped with a\n\n\fA. Feldmeier et al.: X-ray line emission from a fragmented stellar wind\n\n7\n\nwinds like \u03b6 Pup's. On the other hand, with decreasing\noptical depth of nonopaque fragments, line profiles become\nsimilar to those from a homogeneous wind.\n4. X-ray absorption in natal fragments leads to zero\nflux at line center. This kind of double-peaked profile is\nnot observed, which suggests that lateral motions and a\nfinite extent of radiative cooling zones prevents a strict\nspatial coincidence of X-ray emitters and absorbers in 2D, oriented fragments.\nQuantitative modelling of X-ray emission line profiles\nof \u03b6 Pup accounting for an accelerating wind and instrumental broadening will be subject of a forthcoming paper.\nAcknowledgements.

Similar to Fig. 5, but with natal fragment absorption included.\nfull width of v\u221e and a blueshift of v\u221e /2. This is in stark\ncontrast to the well-known gradual decline from the blue\nto the red line wing for a homogeneous wind. The line profiles from the fragmented wind could explain why observed\nX-ray line profiles from \u03b6 Pup are strongly blueshifted, yet\ncan be fitted by a Gaussian function.\n2. A blueshift of v\u221e /2 is too large to be in accord\nwith the (essentially) unshifted X-ray line profiles observed from \u03b6 Ori and \u03b81 Ori C. We suggest that X-rays\nfrom these stars do not originate in instability-generated\nwind shocks, but in colliding wind shocks or processes involving magnetic fields.\n3. The assumption of opaque fragments is applicable if\nt\u01eb/N & 1 (t the radial optical depth of the homogeneous\nwind between radii \u01eb and 1; N the number of fragments\nalong radial rays), as could be the case for dense O star\n\nWe take here a different view at X-ray absorption in a wind\nwith oriented absorbers, using Poisson statistics. The two\nobjectives of this appendix are (i) to make explicit the\nconnection of fragment hits and optical depth, and (ii)\nto obtain an expression for X-ray transmission through\nnonopaque absorbers. We assume N = 1 throughout, and\ngeneralize to N > 1 at the end of the appendix. In the fragmented wind, consider a ring with radius p centered on the\nz axis at latitude \u03b8. The probability that a photon propagating at impact parameter p hits an absorber fragment\nalong the ring is \u03b4wz = \u03b4r within a pathway \u03b4z. Decrease\n\u03b4z until each fragment that is hit along the ring within\nthis \u03b4z fully covers the interval [\u03b8, \u03b8 + \u03b4\u03b8]. Next, divide the\nring into N\u03c6 azimuthal segments of width \u03b4\u03c6 = \u03b4\u03b8. Since\nthe fragment hit probability \u03b4wz in each of these segments\nis small and the number N\u03c6 of segments (or \"trials\") is\nlarge, the requirements for a Poisson distribution are met.\nThe single parameter of the latter is the expectation value,\n\u03bb, here of fragment hits,\n\u03bb = N\u03c6 \u03b4wz =\n\n2\u03c0\u03bcp\n,\n1 \u2212 \u03bc2\n\n(A.1)\n\nusing \u03b4r = \u03bcp \u03b4\u03c6/(1 \u2212 \u03bc2 ). To give an example, \u221a\nconsider\nthe ring with p\u221a= 1/2 and \u03b8 = 45\u25e6 (\u03bc = 1/ 2). On\naverage, \u03bb = \u03c0 2 \u2248 4.44 fragments are hit along this\nring, in a pathway \u03b4z. The independence of the number of\nhits from N\u03c6 is easily understood: if N\u03c6 is doubled, \u03b4\u03c6, \u03b4\u03b8,\n\u03b4z, and \u03b4wz drop by a factor of two, leaving \u03bb unchanged.\nThe probability \u03c0(k) that k fragments are hit along\nthe full ring is,\n\u03c0(k) =\n\n\u03bbk \u2212\u03bb\ne ,\nk!\n\nk = 0, 1, 2, . . .\n\n(A.2)\n\nPhotons at different \u03c6 have different absorption histories,\nbut for simplicity we assume that the whole ring is illuminated by an average intensity hI i i.
