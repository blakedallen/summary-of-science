(2003) and Blay et al. (2004) report a timing and spectral\nanalysis of the transient Be/X-ray pulsar SAX J2103.5+4545 at high energies (5\u2013200 keV). In this work we present\nfor the first time a study of the pulse profile at energies above 20 keV using INTEGRAL data. The spin-pulse\nprofile shows a prominent (with a duty cycle of 14%) and broad (with a FWHM of \u223c 51 s) peak and a secondary\npeak which becomes more evident above 20 keV. The pulsed fraction increases with energy from \u223c 45% at 5\u201340\nkeV to \u223c 80% at 40\u201380 keV. The morphology of the pulse profile also changes as a function of energy, consistent\nwith variations in the spectral components that are visible in the pulse phase resolved spectra. A study of the\ndouble peaked profile shows that the difference in the two peaks can be modeled by a different scattering fraction\nbetween the radiation from the two magnetic poles.\nKey words. accretion - binaries: close - stars: Be - pulsars:individuals: SAX J2103.5+4545 - X-rays: binaries\n\n1. Introduction\nAfter the discovery by Hulleman et al. (1998) and suggestion that it is a Be X-ray binary, SAX J2103.5+4545\nwas conclusive confirmed as such by Reig et al. (2004)\nwho extimate a distance of \u223c 6.5 kpc. The system consists of an accreting neutron star (NS) and a BOV mainsequence donor star which shows Balmer emission lines\n(Reig et al. 2004). The relatively short orbital period, 12.7\ndays (Baykal et al. 2000), and the spin period of \u223c 358 s\n(Hulleman et al. 1998) make SAX J2103.5+4545 a peculiar Be/X-ray transient system. The source does not follow\nthe Ppulse versus Porb relation followed by all other Be\nX-ray binaries as initially established by Corbet (1986).\nThe source has been extensively studied in outburst by\nHulleman et al. (1998) with BeppoSAX , Baykal et al.\n(2000, 2002) with RXTE, \u0130nam et al. (2004) with RXTE\nand XMM-Newton, Reig et al. (2004) at optical and infrared wavelengths, and by Lutovinov et al. (2003), Sidoli\net al. (2004) and Blay et al. (2004) with INTEGRAL.\nWe present here for the first time spin phase resolved\nmeasurements at energies above 20 keV, based on hard Xray INTEGRAL observations of SAX J2103.5+4545 during a bright outburst.\nSend offprint requests to: M. Falanga\n\u22c6\ne-mail: mfalanga@cea.fr\n\n2. Results\n\nThe data were obtained during the AO1 INTEGRAL observation of the Cygnus region, performed from May 2 to\nMay 3 2003 (52761.32\u201352762.43 MJD). We use data from\nthe coded mask imager IBIS/ISGRI (Ubertini et al. 2003;\nLebrun et al. 2003) with an exposure of 75.06 ks, and from\nthe JEM-X monitor (Lund et al. 2003) with an exposure\ntime of 33.34 ks. The data reduction was performed using the standard software and response files provided in\nOSA 3.0 (Goldwurm et al. 2003). We extracted 32 channel spectra for IBIS/ISGRI and 256 channel spectra for\nJEM-X. The spectra were analyzed with the XSPEC V.\n11.3 software package (Arnaud 1996). The background\nsubtracted ISGRI light curve for the timing analysis was\nreduced using dedicated software (ii light extract, version to be included in OSA 5.0). The ISGRI light curve\nper energy band was obtained through a simultaneous fit,\nfor every 20 s long time bin, of all sources detected in\nthe overall image and the background using the standard\nleast squares method in the detector domain. For JEM-X\nthe background subtracted light curve was obtained using\nstandard software (see JEM-X Analysis User Manual).\n\n\f2\n\nM. Falanga, T. Di Salvo, et al.: High-energy properties of SAX J2103.5+4545\n\n2.1. X-ray Timing\nWe searched for coherent pulsations of the source in the\n20\u201340 keV energy band where we have the best statistics. Using the 20 s binned light curve of the source in the\n20\u201340 keV energy band, we computed a Power Density\nSpectrum (PDS) in the frequency range between 5\u00d710\u22125\nand 0.025 Hz from Fast Fourier Transforms. In the resulting PDS an evident signal is present at \u03bd = 2.8296 \u00d7 10\u22123\nHz, and first and second harmonics are also visible. The\nhighest peak in the power spectrum, the first harmonic,\ncorresponds to a nominal period of 353.41 s. The accurate\nperiod was found using the phase-delay fitting method (see\ne.g., Nagase 1989) resulting in P = 353.45 \u00b1 0.16 s, with\nan upper limit to the pulse period derivative of |\u1e56 | < 2.2 s\nyr\u22121 . In this section the errors are given at 1\u03c3 confidence\nlevel for a single parameter. The measured pulse period\nis in agreement with the expected value using the pulse\nperiod of 354.794 s (52761.87 MJD) and the spin-up rate\nof \u223c 7.4 \u00d7 10\u221213 Hz s\u22121 reported by \u0130nam et al. (2004).\n\n(e.g., \u0130nam et al. 2004). Note that these hick-ups are also\npresent in the 40\u201380 keV pulse profile (bottom panel),\nwhile are not significantly present in the 20\u201340 keV pulse\nprofile (middle panel).\n\n2.2. Spectral analysis and pulse phase resolved spectra\n\nFig. 2. Ratio of the \"main\" to \"secondary\" peak of the\npulse profile as a function of energy from 5 to 200 keV.\nThe dotted line is from the best fit two polar cap diffusion\nmodel (see \u00a73).\n\nFig. 1. JEM-X and IBIS/ISGRI light curves of SAX\nJ2103.5+4545 folded at the NS spin period. From top\nto bottom, in the energy range 5\u201320 keV (JEM-X), 20\u2013\n40 keV and 40\u201380 keV (IBIS/ISGRI), respectively. Each\npulse profile is repeated once for clarity.\nFig. 1 shows the folded light curve at the best period. These profiles show a very prominent peak (\u223c 51 s\nFWHM) around phase \u2248 0.8. The pulse fraction (PF), defined here as PF = (Imax \u2212 Imin )/(Imax + Imin ), increases\nwith energy, going from 47.5\u00b10.3% in the 5\u201320 keV energy\nband to 45.4\u00b16.3% at 20\u201340 keV and to 80.2\u00b18.9% at\n40\u201380 keV. In the energy band 80\u2013150 keV the low signalto-noise ratio does not allow a pulse fraction to be determined. The X-ray pulse profile of SAX J2103.5+4545 also\nshows an energy dependent secondary peak around phase\n\u2248 0.2, which becomes more evident at energies above 20\nkeV. Finally, note that the hick-ups in the top panel at\nphase 0.6 seem to be consistent with those observed in\nthe pulse profile of this source by RXTE/XMM-Newton\n\nWe extracted the averaged over the whole observation\nspectrum of the source. In order to investigate the pulse\nphase dependence of the high energy emission from this\nsource, we selected two phase intervals in the pulse profile\nof Fig. 1, one corresponding to the main peak (0.5\u20131.0)\nand the other corresponding to the secondary peak (0\u2013\n0.5). From each of these phase intervals we extracted JEMX and IBIS/ISGRI spectra. The spectral analysis has been\ncarried out in the 5\u201320 keV energy range for JEM-X and in\nthe 20\u2013200 keV energy range for IBIS/ISGRI; the JEM-X\nspectra were rebinned to 28 channels to limit the oversampling of the instrumen resolution to a factor of 3.\nThe two phase-resolved spectra look different as is evident from their ratio plotted as a function of energy in\nFig. 2. The ratio gradually increases from 5 to 30 keV and\nthen decreases at higher energies. Note that the Direct\nContinuum (DC) level is not subtracted from these spectra; this might introduce a variation of the spectral ratio\nsimply due to the fact that the DC level changes with\nenergy. In principle we could estimate the DC level from\nthe spectrum at the minimum of the folded light curve,\nalthough we do not know if all the emission at the minimum of the light curve is due to a DC level, or instead\nis due to unpulsed emission from the polar caps (this is\npossible for instance if parts of the polar caps are always\nvisible). However, the statistics of these data is not good\nenough to extract a meaningful spectrum at the minimum\nof the folded light curve. Note that we took into account\nthe presence of a DC level in the diffusion model that we\nused to fit this spectral ratio (see \u00a73).\n\n\fM. Falanga, T.

The 5\u2013200 keV unfolded spectrum of SAX\nJ2103.5+4545 along with the best fit comptt model.\nTo fit the total spectrum, we first used an absorbed\ncut-off power law model (\u03c72red = 1.28, 48 d.o.f), were the\nphoton index was found to be \u0393 \u223c 1.45 with an cut-off at\nEcut \u223c 30 keV. A better fit was found using an absorbed\npower law multiplied by a high-energy exponential cutoff\nmodel (\u03c72red = 1.37, 47 d.o.f.), where the parameters found\nwere similar to the ones reported in Blay et al. (2004).\nWe then substituted this phenomenological model with\na physically motivated thermal Comptonization model\ncomptt, using the slab geometry (Titarchuk 1994), which\ngives a \u03c72red of 1.09 (47 d.o.f.). Usually the power law\nplus high-energy cutoff model is a good approximation\nof the spectra of high-magnetic field X-ray pulsars, due\nto the fact that the strong magnetic field modifies the\nCompton cross section giving a sharp cutoff in the spectrum. However, in our case, the comptt model provides\na slightly better description of the data with respect to\nthe \"empirical\" power law multiplied by a high-energy exponential cutoff on the entire dataset at 81% confidence\nlevel (estimated by means of an F-test). We therefore prefer to report here the best-fit parameters of the comptt\nmodel. We interpret the parameters of the comptt model\nin the following way: at the bottom of the accretion column, i.e. at the hot spot on the NS surface, a blackbody\nemission, with a temperature kT0 , contributes the soft\ncomponent of the spectrum, and provides also the seed\nphotons for the Comptonization (\u0130nam et al. 2004). These\nare Comptonized in the hot plasma present in the accretion column at a temperature kTe and optical depth \u03c4 .\n\n3. Discussion\nWe analyzed for the first time the shape of the pulse profile of SAX J2103.5+4545 at energies above 20 keV. The\nobserved X-ray pulse profile shows a broad main peak and\na secondary peak that seems to become more prominent\nat higher energies. The differences between the spectra of\nthe main (pulse phase: 0.5\u20131) and secondary (pulse phase:\n0\u20130.5) peak are evident in their ratio, which increases with\nincreasing energy up to \u223c 30 keV and then decreases, indicating that the main peak is characterized by an excess\nof emission in the energy range 20\u201350 keV; the difference\nin the mean 5\u2013200 keV luminosity between the two pulse\nphase resolved spectra is a factor of about 1.5. The pulsed\nfraction is observed to significantly and steeply increase\nwith energy, from \u223c 45% up to 40 keV to \u223c 80% in the\nrange 40\u201380 keV. A similar behaviour was also found for\nthe Be/X-ray transient RX J0117.6-733 where the pulsed\npercentage increased to at least 79% in the 20-70 keV band\n(Macomb et al, 1999).\nThe average spectrum, as well as the pulse phase\nresolved spectra (i.e. main peak spectrum and secondary peak spectrum) can be well described by a\nComptonization model. According to this model, the seed\nphotons for the Comptonization have a temperature of\nkT0 \u223c 1.5 keV, injected from the bottom of the accretion\nshock of electron temperature kTe \u223c 13 keV and Thomson\noptical depth \u03c4 \u223c 2.4. The electron temperature is too\nhigh for an accretion disk (Frank, King & Raine 2000).\nIn the hypothesis that the two peaks in the pulse profile come from the two polar caps on the NS surface, the\nvariation of the pulse profile with energy cannot be simply\nexplained by geometrical effects (the viewing angles of the\n\n\f4\n\nM. Falanga, T. Di Salvo, et al.: High-energy properties of SAX J2103.5+4545\n\npolar caps, when directed towards the observer, are different and the projected emission areas in the line of sight\nare different) because the geometrical effects can change\nthe observed flux but not the spectral shape. We therefore propose that the differences between the spectra at\nthe two peaks is mainly caused by scattering effects. Since\nthe main peak do not vary significantly with the energy\nwe consider in our model that only the second peak is\nscattered.\nConsidering that the radiation in the main peak comes\nfrom one polar cap and from the continuum of the NS,\nthe flux can be written Ispot + INS . The secondary peak\n\u2032\n\u2032\nthen is Ispot\ne\u2212\u03c4 + INS (part of the secondary pole emis\u2032\nsion (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 ) is scattered away from the line of sight\nand does not contribute to the the observed peak flux). \u03c4 \u2032\nis given from the Comptonization fit parameter and from\nthe Klein-Nishina equation, noting that in our case kTe \u226a\nmc2 . Above 30 keV, the pulsed fraction is 80% which\nshows that the continuum from the NS has a small contribution. In that energy range, the ratio given in Fig. 2 represents the ratio of the two flux peaks, which indeed is well\n\u2032\nfitted by the simple diffusive model, (1 + \u03b1)/(1 + \u03b1\u2032 e\u2212\u03c4 ),\n\u2032\n\u2032\nwhere \u03b1 = Ispot /INS and \u03b1 = Ispot /INS (note that Ispot\n\u2032\nand Ispot\nmay be different due to geometrical effects, since\nthe viewing angles of the magnetic poles, when directed\ntowards the observer, may be different giving a difference\nin the projected emission areas along the line of sight).\nAlthough the statistics are not good enough to constrain\nall the parameters (the error bars on the single parameters are quite large), interestingly we always obtain that\n\u03b1\u2032 = 0.1\u03b1. We can therefore quantify the geometrical difference between the two projected emission areas in 10%.\nOn the other hand, in the energy range between 5\u201330 keV\nwith a pulsed fraction of \u223c 50%, the continuum of the\nNS contributes half of the emission. The emission of the\nsecondary peak is likely scattered through the Compton\nshock layer, above the hot spot, and contributes to the\ncontinuum.\nFinally, from the observed double-peaked folded light\ncurve, we infer a limit on the angles that determine the\ngeometry of the accretion powered pulsar (if the NS has a\npure centered dipole field); these are the angle between\nthe rotation axis and the direction to the observer, i,\nand the angle between the magnetic and rotation axes,\n\u03b2. Assuming a typical mass value of 20 M\u2299 for the BOV\ncompanion star (Reig et al. 2004) and a 1.4 M\u2299 NS, from\nthe mass function the inclination angle of the system is\ni \u223c 30\u25e6 . The parameter space when two polar caps are\nseen is determined by the condition i > 90\u25e6 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b4g,\nwhere \u03b4g is the gravitational light deflection of the emitted X-ray (Beloborodov 2002). In our case, considering \u03b4g\n= 0, this leads to \u03b2 < 60\u25e6 , or higher with non zero \u03b4g.\nThe gravitational light bending effect is less then 10\u25e6 (see\nBulik et al. 2003).\nAcknowledgements.
