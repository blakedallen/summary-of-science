Together with the\nresults of [C] and [CM2], this leads to the full classification of three-dimensional Lorentzian\ng.o. spaces and naturally reductive spaces.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nA (connected) pseudo-Riemannian manifold (M, g) is homogeneous provided that there exists\na group K of isometries acting transitively on it [O'N], that is, for any points p, q \u2208 M , there\nis an isometry \u03c6 \u2208 K such that \u03c6(p) = q. Such (M, g) can be then identified with (K/H, g),\nwhere H is the isotropy group at a fixed point o of M . We recall here a few results concerning\nhomogeneous manifolds, in the Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian case (in particular, in\nLorentzian geometry).\nGadea and Oubi\u00f1a [GO] introduced homogeneous pseudo-Riemannian structures in order\nto characterize reductive homogeneous pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. Earlier, a corresponding\nresult had been proved for all homogeneous Riemannian manifolds by Ambrose and Singer [AS]\n(see also [TV]).\nSekigawa [Se] proved that a three-dimensional connected, simply connected and complete\nhomogeneous Riemannian manifold is either symmetric or it is a Lie group endowed of a leftinvariant Riemannian metric. Taking into account the classification of three-dimensional Riemannian Lie groups given by Milnor [Mi], this result permits to determine all three-dimensional\nhomogeneous Riemannian manifolds.\nRecently, the first author obtained the following similar result in the Lorentzian framework:\nTheorem 1.1 [C] Let (M, g) be a three-dimensional connected, simply connected, complete\nhomogeneous Lorentzian manifold. Then, either (M, g) is symmetric, or it is isometric to a\nthree-dimensional Lie group equipped with a left-invariant Lorentzian metric.\nTheorem 1.1, together with the results on three-dimensional Lorentzian Lie groups obtained\nby Cordero and Parker [C0Pa2] and Rahmani [R], leads to the classification of three-dimensional\nhomogeneous Lorentzian manifolds.\n\u2217 Authors supported by funds of MURST, GNSAGA and the University of Lecce.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification: 53C20,53C22, 53C30.\nKeywords and phrases: Lorentzian homogeneous spaces, homogeneous geodesics, naturally reductive spaces, g.o.\nspaces.\n\n1\n\n\fIt is then natural to try to characterize and classify some special classes of three-dimensional\nhomogeneous Lorentzian manifolds having a special geometric meaning, also in order to compare such results in the Lorentzian case with their Riemannian analogues. In [C], the first\nauthor classified three-dimensional Lorentzian symmetric spaces. Broader interesting classes of\nhomogeneous Lorentzian spaces are given by naturally reductive and g.o. spaces, both related\nto the notion of homogeneous geodesic.\nLet (M = K/H, g) be a pseudo-Riemannian homogeneous manifold. A geodesic \u0393 through\nthe origin o \u2208 M = K/H is called homogeneous if it is the orbit of a 1-parameter subgroup. In\ngeneral, the group K is not unique. If \u0393 is homogeneous with respect to some isometry group\nK \u2032 , then it is also homogeneous with respect to the maximal connected group of isometries K,\nbut the converse does not hold [KNVl].\nHomogeneous geodesics of homogeneous Riemannian manifolds have been investigated by\nmany authors. We can refer to [CM1],[CKM],[K2],[KNVl],[KS],[KV],[KVl],[M], for some examples and further references. In [KS], O. Kowalski and J. Szenthe proved the fundamental result\nthat any homogeneous Riemannian manifold admits at least one homogeneous geodesic.\nA corresponding existence result holds in the Lorentzian case, provided that the space is\nreductive homogeneous [P]. In the framework of Lorentzian geometry, homogeneous geodesics\nalso aquire a new interest, since homogeneous Lorentzian spaces for which all null geodesics\nare homogeneous, are candidates for constructing solutions to the 11-dimensional supergravity,\nwhich preserve more than 24 of the available 32 supersymmetries. In fact, all Penrose limits,\npreserving the amount of supersymmetry, of such a solution, must preserve homogeneity, which\nis the case for the Penrose limit of a reductive homogeneous spacetime along a null homogeneous\ngeodesic ([Me],[P],[FMeP]).\nA pseudo-Riemannian reductive homogeneous space (M = K/H, g) is called a g.o. space if\nall its geodesics are homogeneous, it is naturally reductive if there exists at least one reductive\nsplit k = m \u2295 h such that\n(1.1)\n\n< [X, Y ]m , Z > + < [X, Z]m , Y >= 0,\n\nfor all X, Y, Z \u2208 m. It is not always easy to decide whether a homogeneous (reductive) pseudoRiemannian manifold is or is not naturally reductive, because condition (1.1) must be checked\nfor all groups of isometries acting transitively on M [TV]. It is also well-known that (1.1)\nholds if and only if the Levi-Civita connection of (M, g) and the canonical connection (of the\nreductive split k = m \u2295 h) have exactly the same geodesics [TV]. Clearly, a naturally reductive\nspace is g.o., but in dimension greater than 5 there exist Riemannian g.o. spaces which are\nin no way naturally reductive [KV], while in dimension three the two classes of Riemannian\nhomogeneous spaces coincide. It is well-known that symmetric spaces are special examples of\nnaturally reductive spaces. We recall that three-dimensional naturally reductive Lorentzian\nspaces have been already investigated by Cordero and Parker in [CoPa1], in order to determine\nthe possible forms and the symmetry groups of their curvature tensor.\nIn [CM2], the authors determined homogeneous geodesics of all three-dimensional unimodular Lie groups admitting a left-invariant Lorentzian metric. In this paper, we investigate\nhomogeneous geodesics of three-dimensional non-unimodular Lorentzian Lie groups. Taking\ninto account Theorem 1.1, this permits to determine all three-dimensional g.o. and naturally\nreductive Lorentzian spaces.\nThe paper is organized in the following way. In Section 2, we shall recall the basic definitions\nand properties of homogeneous geodesics in a homogeneous pseudo-Riemannian manifold. In\nSection 3, we shall report the classification of three-dimensional homogeneous Lorentzian manifolds, and we shall describe the set of geodesic vectors for all three-dimensional non-unimodular\nLorentzian Lie groups. In Section 4 we will then give the classification of three-dimensional\nnaturally reductive and g.o. Lorentzian manifolds.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nPreliminaries on homogeneous geodesics\n\nLet (M, g) be a (connected) homogeneous pseudo-Riemannian manifold. Then, its full isometry\ngroup I(M ) acts transitively on it and M can be identified with (K/H, g), where K \u2282 I(M ) is\na connected subgroup of I(M ) acting transitively on M and H is the isotropy group at a fixed\npoint o \u2208 M . In general, we can have more than one choice for K.\nIn contrast to the Riemannian case, the Lie algebra k of K does not need to admit a reductive\ndecomposition. Denote by k and h the Lie algebras of K and H respectively, and let m be a\ncomplement of h in k. If m is stable under the action of h, then k = m\u2295h is called a reductive split,\nand (k, h) a reductive pair. It is important to stress that reductivity is not an intrinsic property\nof (M, g), but of the description of M as coset space K/H. In fact, the socalled Kaigorodov space\nis an example of a homogeneous Lorentzian manifold which has two different coset descriptions,\nbut only one of them is reductive [FMeP]. Nevertheless, a homogeneous pseudo-Riemannian\nmanifold (M, g) is called reductive if there exists a Lie group K acting transitively on M via\nisometries, with corresponding isotropy group H, such that (k, h) is reductive.\nReductive homogeneous pseudo-Riemannian manifolds are characterized by the existence of\na pseudo-Riemannian homogeneous structure. Let M be a connected manifold and g a pseudoRiemannian metric on M . We denote by \u2207 the Levi-Civita connection of (M, g) and by R its\ncurvature tensor.\nDefinition 2.1 A homogeneous pseudo-Riemannian structure on (M, g) is a tensor field T of\n \u0303 = \u2207 \u2212 T satisfies\ntype (1, 2) on M , such that the connection \u2207\n(2.1)\n\n \u0303 = 0,\n\u2207g\n\n \u0303 = 0,\n\u2207R\n\n \u0303 = 0.\n\u2207T\n\nIn the Riemannian case, homogeneous structures were first introduced by Ambrose and\nSinger [AS], and further investigated by Tricerri and Vanhecke [TV]. Gadea and Oubi\u00f1a proved\nthe following\nTheorem 2.2 [GO] Let (M, g) be a connected, simply connected and complete pseudo-Riemannian manifold. Then, (M, g) admits a homogeneous pseudo-Riemannian structure if and only\nif it is a reductive homogeneous pseudo-Riemannian manifold.\n \u0303 satisfying conditions (2.1), is called the canonical connection associated\nThe connection \u2207,\nto the homogeneous pseudo-Riemannian structure T . In the special case of a symmetric space,\n \u0303 satisfies the condition T\u0303 = 0 and hence, \u2207\n \u0303 coincides with the Levithe torsion tensor T\u0303 of \u2207\nCivita connection \u2207 of (M, g). In [C], in order to prove Theorem 1.1, the first author showed\nthat any non-symmetric three-dimensional homogeneous Lorentzian manifold (M, g) admits a\nhomogeneous Lorentzian structure T such that TX Y = \u2207X Y for all X, Y vector fields tangent\nto M . In particular, by Theorem 2.2, all three-dimensional homogeneous Lorentzian spaces are\nthen reductive.\nLet k = m \u2295 h a reductive split coming from a homogeneous pseudo-Riemannian structure\n \u0303 = \u2207 \u2212 T are curves of the form\nT . The geodesics of \u2207\n(2.2)\n\n\u0393(t) = exp(tX)(o), t \u2208 IR,\n\nwith X \u2208 m. They are called canonical geodesics of (M, g) [KoNo,Chapter 10, Cor.2.5].\nConsider now a reductive homogeneous pseudo-Riemannian manifold (M = K/H, g), where\nk = m \u2295 h is a reductive split. As already mentioned in the Introduction, a geodesic \u0393 through\nthe origin o \u2208 K/H is homogeneous if it is of the form \u0393(t) = exp(tZ)(o), for some Z \u2208 k. If\n\u0393(t) = exp(tX)(o) is a geodesic for some X \u2208 m, then \u0393(t) is also a geodesic for the canonical\n \u0303 For this reason, such geodesics are called canonically homogeneous. In general, a\nconnection \u2207.\n3\n\n\fhomogeneous geodesic is not canonically homogeneous. Note that any reductive homogeneous\nLorentzian manifold (M, g) admits at least one homogeneous geodesic through a point [P]. The\nquestion whether such a space always admits a null homogeneous geodesic through a point, had\na negative answer in [CM2]. Further examples will be given in Section 3.\nWe now recall how the geometric problem of finding homogeneous geodesics of a reductive\nhomogeneous space, reduces to the algebraic problem of determining its geodesic vectors. Let\n(M = K/H, g) be a reductive homogeneous Lorentzian manifold and k = m\u2295h the corresponging\nreductive split of the Lie algebra k. The canonical projection p : K \u2192 K/H induces an isomorphism between the subspace m and the tangent space To (M ). In particular, the Lorentzian\nmetric go on To (M ) induces a Lorentzian metric <, > on m, which is Ad(H)-invariant. The\nfollowing characterization is a crucial step for determining homogeneous geodesics of a reductive\nhomogeneous pseudo-Riemannian manifold:\nProposition 2.3 ([P],[FMP],[DK]). Consider a geodesic \u0393(t) of M = K/H, with \u0393(0) = o\nand \u0393\u2032 (0) = Xm \u2208 m (\u2261 To (K/H)). \u0393(t) is homogeneous if and only if there exists Xh \u2208 h such\nthat X = Xm + Xh \u2208 k satisfies\n(2.3)\n\n< [X, Y ]m , Xm >= k < Xm , Y >,\n\nfor all Y \u2208 m and some k \u2208 IR depending on Xm .\nProposition 2.3, whose proof can be found in [DK], is the Lorentzian analogue of Proposition\n2.1 of [KV], characterizing homogeneous geodesics of a Riemannian homogeneous space.\nA vector X \u2208 k satisfying (2.3) is called a geodesic vector. When Xm is either spacelike\n(< Xm , Xm >> 0) or timelike (< Xm , Xm >< 0), applying (2.3) with Y = Xm we get k = 0,\nwhile for a null vector Xm , k may be any real constant. Note also that if h = 0, then k = m\nand (2.3) simplifies as follows:\n(2.4)\n\n< [X, Y ], X >= k < X, Y >,\n\nfor all Y \u2208 k.\nA finite family {\u03931 , \u03932 , ..., \u0393k } of homogeneous geodesics through o \u2208 M = K/H is said to\nbe linearly independent if the corresponding initial tangent vectors at o are linearly independent.\nThe following result is obvious.\nProposition 2.4 A finite family {\u03931 , \u03932 , ..., \u0393k } of homogeneous geodesics through po \u2208 M =\nK/H is linearly independent if the m-components of the corresponding geodesic vectors are\nlinearly independent.\n\n3\n\nThree-dimensional unimodular Lorentzian Lie groups and their\nhomogeneous geodesics\n\nS. Rahmani [R] classified three-dimensional unimodular Lie groups equipped with a left-invariant\nLorentzian metric, obtaining a result corresponding to the one found by Milnor [Mi] in the\nRiemannian case. Earlier, Cordero and Parker [CoPa2] already studied three-dimensional Lie\ngroups equipped with left-invariant Lorentzian metrics, determining their curvature tensors and\ninvestigating the symmetry groups of the sectional curvature in the different cases. In particular, they wrote down the possible forms of a non-unimodular Lie algebra.

As group space, G admits a left-invariant\n \u0303 such that \u2207\n \u0303 X Y = 0 for all X, Y \u2208 g [KoNo]. Let R\u0303 and T\u0303 denote the curvature\nconnection \u2207,\n \u0303 respectively. Then, R\u0303(X, Y ) = 0 and T\u0303 (X, Y ) =\ntensor and the torsion tensor associated to \u2207,\n \u0303 where \u2207 is the\n\u2212[X, Y ] for all vector fields X, Y \u2208 g. By Theorem 2.2, the tensor T = \u2207 \u2212 \u2207,\nLevi-Civita connection, is a Lorentzian homogeneous structure.\nFor all possible forms gi , i = 5, 6, 7, we shall compute the Lie algebra k of the connected\ncomponent K of the full isometry group I(G), find a reductive decomposition and determine\ngeodesic vectors.\nIn order to determine h so that k = g \u2295 h, we first note that h is isomorphic to the set of\nall self-adjoint endomorphisms A of g, such that A(R) = A(\u2207R) = ... = A(\u2207n R) = 0 for all n.\nBecause G is three-dimensional, we equivalently have\nh = {A \u2208 gl(g)/A(g) = A(\u033a) = A(\u2207\u033a) = ... = A(\u2207n \u033a)... = 0}.\nMoreover, put\nhk = {A \u2208 gl(g)/A(g) = A(\u033a) = A(\u2207\u033a) = ... = A(\u2207k \u033a) = 0},\nfor any k = 0, 1, .., and\nl = {A \u2208 gl(g)/A(g) = A(R\u0303) = A(T\u0303 ) = 0}.\nThen, we clearly have\nl \u2282 h \u2282 hk ,\nfor all k and so, if l = hk for some k, then h = l. We refer to [K1, p.54] for more details.\nLet A be an endomorphism of g and {e1 , e2 , e3 } a pseudo-orthonormal basis of g, with\ne3 timelike. Condition A(g) = 0 means that A is self-adjoint. Hence, there exist some real\nconstants a, b, c, such that\n(3.9)\n\nAe1 = be2 + ce3 ,\n\nAe2 = \u2212be1 + ae3 ,\n7\n\nAe3 = ce1 + ae2 .\n\n\fSince R\u0303 = 0 T\u0303 (X, Y ) = \u2212[X, Y ], condition A(R\u0303) = 0 is trivially satisfied, while A(T\u0303 ) = 0 is\nequivalent to\n(3.10)\n\nA [ei , ej ] = [Aei , ej ] + [ei , Aej ]\n\nfor all i, j.\n\nNow, we shall inspect our three basic algebras case by case.\n(g5 ): Consider an endomporphism A of g5 satisfying (3.9). Starting from (3.5), we can write\ndown (3.10) and we get\n\uf8f1\n\u03b1a \u2212 \u03b3c = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u03b2a\n\u2212 \u03b4c = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n(\u03b2 + \u03b3)b = 0,\n(3.11)\n(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4)b = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u03b2a\n+ \u03b1c = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u03b4a + \u03b3c = 0.\nTaking into account \u03b1 + \u03b4 6= 0 and \u03b1\u03b3 + \u03b2\u03b4 = 0, we have two possible cases:\n\n(I): (\u03b3, \u03b4) 6= (\u2212\u03b2, \u03b1). In this case, a = b = c = 0 is the only solution of (3.11), that is, l = 0.\n(II): (\u03b3, \u03b4) = (\u2212\u03b2, \u03b1). Then, by (3.11), we only get a = c = 0. So, l = Span(A), where\nAe1 = e2 , Ae2 = \u2212e1 and Ae3 = 0.\n(g6 ): Let A be an endomporphism of g6 satisfying (3.9). We use (3.6) to compute (3.10)\nand we obtain\n\uf8f1\n(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4)a = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3)a = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u03b1b \u2212 \u03b2c = 0,\n(3.12)\n\u03b3b\n\u2212 \u03b4c = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u03b3b\n+\n\u03b1c = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u03b4b + \u03b2c = 0.\n\nSince \u03b1 + \u03b4 6= 0 and \u03b1\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b2\u03b4 = 0, we have that if (\u03b3, \u03b4) 6= (\u03b2, \u03b1), then a = b = c = 0 is the only\nsolution of (3.12). Therefore, in this case l = 0. In the remaining case, (\u03b3, \u03b4) = (\u03b2, \u03b1) and so,\nby Proposition 3.3, (G, g) is symmetric.\n(g7 ): Let A be an endomporphism of g7 , satisfying (3.9). By (3.7), we see that A satisfies\n(3.10) if and only if\n\uf8f1\n\u03b2(b \u2212 c) = \u03b1a \u2212 \u03b3c,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u03b2a + \u03b1b = \u03b4c \u2212 \u03b2a,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u03b2a + \u03b1c = \u03b4c \u2212 \u03b2a,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u03b2(b \u2212 c) = \u03b1a \u2212 \u03b3b,\n\u03b2a + \u03b1b = \u03b4b \u2212 \u03b2a,\n(3.13)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u03b2a + \u03b1c = \u03b4b \u2212 \u03b2a,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u03b1(c \u2212 b) = \u03b4(c \u2212 b),\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u03b2(c\n\u2212 b) = \u03b4a + \u03b3b,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u03b2(c \u2212 b) = \u03b4a + \u03b3c.\n\nIt is easy to show that, whenever \u03b1 6= \u03b4, we have a = b = c = 0 as the only solution of (3.13)\nand so, l = 0. On the other hand, if \u03b1 = \u03b4 then, by (3.7), \u03b1 6= 0 and \u03b3 = 0. In this case,\nProposition 3.3 implies that (G, g) is symmetric.\nNext, routine but very long calculations can show that, for any g = gi , i = 5, 6, 7, there\nexists a k \u2264 2 such that l = hk . In particular, we have the following\n8\n\n\fProposition 3.4 Let (G, g) be a non-unimodular Lie group, equipped with a non-symmetric\nleft-invariant Lorentzian metric, and g its Lie algebra.\n\u2022 When g = g5 , we have h0 = l, except in the following cases:\na) if (\u03b3, \u03b4) 6= (\u2212\u03b2, \u03b3) and \u03b2\u03b4 6= 0, then h1 = l = 0.\nb) if either \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 0 and \u03b3 6= 0 6= \u03b4, or \u03b3 = \u03b4 = 0 and \u03b1 6= 0 6= \u03b2, then h2 = l = 0.\n\u2022 When g = g6 , we have h0 = l = 0, unless (\u03b3, \u03b4) 6= (\u03b2, \u03b3) and \u03b2(\u03b2 2 \u2212 \u03b12 ) 6= 0. In the last\ncase, h2 = l = 0.\n\u2022 When g = g7 , we have h0 = l = 0, except in the following cases:\na) if \u03b3 = 0 and \u03b1\u03b4(\u03b12 \u2212 \u03b4 2 ) 6= 0, then h1 = l = 0.\nb) if \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 0 6= \u03b3, then h2 = l = 0.\nBy Proposition 3.4, we have h = l for all non-symmetric non-unimodular Lorentzian Lie groups.\nTherefore, for each of them, k = g \u2295 l is the Lie algebra of the connected component K of the\nfull isometry group of G. So, we can now determine the homogeneous geodesics in the different\ncases.\n(g5 ): If (\u03b3, \u03b4) = (\u2212\u03b2, \u03b1) then, by Proposition 3.3, (G, g) is symmetric. In particular, it\nis naturally reductive. Hence, in the sequel we shall assume (\u03b3, \u03b4) 6= (\u2212\u03b2, \u03b3). In this case,\nh = l = 0 and so, k = g5 and K = G. A vector X \u2208 g5 is geodesic if and only if (2.4) holds\nfor all Y \u2208 g5 and some constant k. We write down (2.4) for Y = ei , i = 1, 2, 3. Using (3.5)\nand taking into account that X = x1 e1 + x2 e2 + x3 e3 , we find that (2.4) is equivalent to the\nfollowing system:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\u2212x3 (\u03b1x1 + \u03b2x2 ) = kx1 ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u2212x3 (\u03b3x1 + \u03b4x2 ) = kx2 ,\n(3.14)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u03b1x21 + (\u03b2 + \u03b3)x1 x2 + \u03b4x22 = \u2212kx3 .\nIn determining the solutions of (3.14) we must also take into account that, by (3.5), \u03b1 + \u03b4 6= 0\nand \u03b1\u03b3 + \u03b2\u03b4 = 0. It is easy to prove that when k = 0, the solutions of (3.14) are either\nx3 = \u03b1x21 + (\u03b2 + \u03b3)x1 x2 + \u03b4x22 = 0, x1 = x2 = 0, \u03b1x1 + \u03b2x2 = 0 (but only if \u03b3 = \u03b4 = 0), or\n\u03b3x1 + \u03b4x2 = 0 (but only if \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 0). If k 6= 0, only null-like solutions can occur, so we must\nadd we must add to (3.14) the condition\n(3.15)\n\nx21 + x22 \u2212 x23 = 0.\n\nStandard calculations show that, when k 6= 0, (3.14) and (3.15) are both satisfied if and only if\n\u03b3x21 + (\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b1)x1 x2 \u2212 \u03b2x22 = 0. Summarizing, geodesic vectors have one of the following forms:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nX = x1 e1 + x2 e2 , with \u03b1x21 + (\u03b2 + \u03b3)x1 x2 + \u03b4x22 = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nX = x3 e3 ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nX = x1 (\u03b4e1 \u2212 \u03b3e2 ) + x3 e3 but \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 0,\n(3.16)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nX = x2 (\u2212\u03b2e1 + \u03b1e2 ) + x3 e3 but \u03b3 = \u03b4 = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\np\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 X = x1 e1 + x2 e2 \u00b1 x21 + x22 e3 with \u03b3x21 + (\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b1)x1 x2 \u2212 \u03b2x22 = 0.\n9\n\n\fNote that, by (3.16), whenever (\u03b1, \u03b2) 6= (0, 0) 6= (\u03b3, \u03b4) and (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4)2 + 4\u03b2\u03b3 < 0, there are not\nnull-like geodesic vectors. So, in this case G does not admit null homogeneous geodesics. If in\naddition (\u03b2 + \u03b3)2 \u2212 4\u03b1\u03b4 < 0, then the only geodesic vectors are the ones parallel to e3 (timelike).\n(g6 ): We assume (\u03b3, \u03b4) 6= (\u03b2, \u03b3), since in the remaining case, G is symmetric. When\n(\u03b3, \u03b4) 6= (\u03b2, \u03b3), we have h = l = 0 and so, k = g6 and K = G. This case is quite similar to the\ncorresponding one for g5 . In fact, a vector X = x1 e1 + x2 e2 + x3 e3 \u2208 k is geodesic if and only\nif satisfies (2.4), that is, using (3.6),\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\u2212\u03b1x22 + (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3)x2 x3 + \u03b4x23 = kx1 ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nx1 (\u03b1x2 \u2212 \u03b2x3 ) = kx2 ,\n(3.17)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nx1 (\u03b3x2 \u2212 \u03b4x3 ) = \u2212kx3 .\n\nBy (3.5) we have \u03b1 + \u03b4 6= 0 and \u03b1\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b2\u03b4 = 0. For k = 0, the solutions of (3.19) are either\nx1 = \u03b1x22 + (\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b2)x2 x3 \u2212 \u03b4x23 = 0, x2 = x3 = 0, \u03b1x2 \u2212 \u03b2x3 = 0 (but only if \u03b3 = \u03b4 = 0), or\n\u03b3x2 \u2212 \u03b4x3 = 0 (but only if \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 0). Indeed, \u03b1x2 \u2212 \u03b2x3 = 0 and \u03b3x2 \u2212 \u03b4x3 = 0 also occur\nas solutions of (3.19) when (\u03b2, \u03b4) = \u00b1(\u03b1, \u03b3), but in this case we get a symmetric space [C] and\nso, we discard it.\nIf k 6= 0, the null-like solutions of (3.19) are all and the ones triples (x1 , x2 , x3 ) satisfying\n\u03b3x22 + (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4)x2 x3 \u2212 \u03b2x23 = 0 (and the null-like condition(3.15)). Therefore, geodesic vectors\nhave one of the following forms:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nX = x2 e2 + x3 e3 , with \u03b1x21 + (\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b2)x2 x3 \u2212 \u03b4x23 = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 X = x1 e1 ,\n(3.18)\n\nX = x1 e1 + x2 (\u03b4e2 + \u03b3e3 ) but \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nX = x1 e1 + x3 (\u03b2e2 + \u03b1e3 ) but \u03b3 = \u03b4 = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\np\n\uf8f3\nX = x1 e1 + x2 e2 \u00b1 x21 + x22 e3 with \u03b3x22 + (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4)x2 x3 \u2212 \u03b2x23 = 0.\n\nBy (3.20), whenever (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3)2 + 4\u03b1\u03b4 < 0, (\u03b1, \u03b2) 6= (0, 0) 6= (\u03b3, \u03b4) and (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4)2 + 4\u03b2\u03b3 < 0, the\nonly geodesic vectors are the ones parallel to e1 (spacelike).\n(g7 ): By (3.7), \u03b1\u03b3 = 0, that is, either \u03b1 = 0 or \u03b3 = 0. It is enough to consider the case\n\u03b1 6= \u03b4, since in the remaining case we have a symmetric space. In fact, if \u03b1 = \u03b4, then (3.7)\nimplies 2\u03b1 = \u03b1 + \u03b4 6= 0 and so, \u03b3 = 0. Then, \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4 = \u03b3 = 0 and, by Proposition 3.3, (G, g) is\nsymmetric.\nSo, in the sequel we shall assume \u03b1 6= \u03b4. Then, h = 0, that is, k = g7 and K = G. Applying\n(2.4) and taking into account (3.7), we find that a vector X \u2208 g7 is geodesic if and only if\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n(x2 \u2212 x3 )[\u03b1x1 + \u03b2(x2 \u2212 x3 )] = kx1 ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n(\u03b1x1 + \u03b3x3 )x1 + (\u03b2x1 + \u03b4x3 )(x2 \u2212 x3 ) = \u2212kx2 ,\n(3.19)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n(\u03b1x1 + \u03b3x2 )x1 + (\u03b2x1 + \u03b4x2 )(x2 \u2212 x3 ) = \u2212kx3 .\nWe exclude the case \u03b1 = \u03b3 = 0, since by Proposition 3.3 it corresponds to a symmetric space.\nIn order to solve system (3.21), we shall treat separately the cases \u03b1 = 0 6= \u03b3 and \u03b3 = 0 6= \u03b1.\nA): \u03b1 = 0 6= \u03b3. Then, (3.21) becomes\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\u03b2(x2 \u2212 x3 )2 = kx1 ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u03b3x1 x3 + (\u03b2x1 + \u03b4x3 )(x2 \u2212 x3 ) = \u2212kx2 ,\n(3.20)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u03b3x1 x2 + (\u03b2x1 + \u03b4x2 )(x2 \u2212 x3 ) = \u2212kx3 .\n10\n\n\fBy standard calculations we get that when k = 0, (3.22) holds if and only if either x2 = x3 = 0,\nx1 = x2 \u2212 x3 = 0 or \u03b3x1 + \u03b4(x2 \u2212 x3 ) = 0 (the latter only if \u03b2 = 0). When k 6= 0, we must\nconsider only null-like solutions. We treat separately the cases x1 = 0 and x1 6= 0. If x1 = 0,\nwe easily conclude that (3.22) only admits the solution x1 = x2 + x3 = 0, and only if \u03b2 = 0.\nIn the remaining case x1 6= 0, we can use the first equation of (3.22) to write k in function of\nx1 , x2 and x3 . Then, rather long calculations lead to show that the only null-like solutions of\n(3.22) (with x1 6= 0) are of the form\nx1 =\n\n\u03b2+\u03b3\n\u03b2\u2212\u03b3\nx2 \u2212\nx3 ,\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\n\nwhere x2 , x3 must satisfy the second order homogeneous equation\n(3.21)\n\n[(\u03b2 + \u03b3)2 + \u03b4 2 ]x22 \u2212 2(\u03b2 2 \u2212 \u03b3 2 )x2 x3 + [(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3)2 \u2212 \u03b4 2 ]x23 = 0.\n\nEquation (3.21) only admits real solutions when \u03b4 2 (4\u03b2\u03b3 + \u03b4 2 ) \u2265 0. Since \u03b1 = 0, we have\n2\n2\n4\nD = \u22124\u03b2\u03b3\n\u03b4 2 . Therefore, \u03b4 (4\u03b2\u03b3 + \u03b4 ) = \u03b4 (1 \u2212 D) and so, such solutions exist if and only if\nD \u2264 1.

Then, it is easy to conclude that, apart from cases corresponding to\nsymmetric spaces listed in Proposition 3.3, (3.25) holds if and only if x1 = x2 \u2212 x3 = 0. For\nk 6= 0, if x1 = 0, then (3.25) admit the solution x1 = x2 + x3 = 0, but only if \u03b2 = 0.

For example, taking into account that, by (3.5),\n\u03b1\u03b3 + \u03b2\u03b4 = 0, we have that, for a Lie algebra g5 with (\u03b3, \u03b4) 6= (\u2212\u03b2, \u03b1), geodesic vectors either of\nthe form x1 (\u03b4e1 \u2212 \u03b3e2 ) + x3 e3 or x2p\n(\u2212\u03b2e1 + \u03b1e2 ) + x3 e3 exist if and only if D = 0, and geodesic\nvectors of the form x1 e1 + x2 e2 \u00b1 x21 + x22 e3 exist if and only if D \u2264 1.\nThe most interesting results concerning the existence of linearly independent and null homogeneous geodesics are summarized in the following Theorems 3.6 and 3.7.\nTheorem 3.6 Let G be a three-dimensional non-unimodular Lie group, equipped with a leftinvariant Lorentzian metric g, and g the Lie algebra of G.

Lorentzian spaces\n\nIn the previous Section, we determined all geodesic vectors for the different possible forms of\nthe Lie algebra of a three-dimensional Lorentzian non-unimodular Lie group. A corresponding investigation was made in [CM2] in the unimodular case. Because of Theorem 1.1, every\n(connected, simply connected) three-dimensional homogeneous Lorentzian manifold M is isometric to a Lie group equipped with a left-invariant Lorentzian metric, unless M is symmetric.\nIf M is symmetric, then in particular it is naturally reductive and a g.o. space. Hence, we\nactually know the sets of homogeneous geodesics through a point for all three-dimensional homogeneous Lorentzian manifolds, and this allows us to classify three-dimensional Lorentzian\ng.o. and naturally reductive spaces.\nThe results of Section 4 of [CM2], as concerns the existence of g.o. spaces, can be summarized\nin the following\nTheorem 4.1 [CM2] A three-dimensional unimodular Lorentzian Lie group (G, g) is a g.o.\nspace if and only if either it is symmetric, or its Lie algebra g is one of the following:\n\u2022 g = g3 , with either \u03b1 = \u03b2 6= \u03b3, \u03b1 = \u03b3 6= \u03b2 or \u03b2 = \u03b3 6= \u03b1.\n\u2022 g = g4 , with \u03b1 = \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b5.\nMoreover, in all these cases, G is also naturally reductive.\n\n13\n\n\fOn the other hand, Section 3 here permits to conclude that a three-dimensional nonunimodular Lorentzian Lie group is never a g.o. space, unless it is symmetric. (The same\nresult is true in the Riemannian case [TV].) Therefore, the following classification result holds:\nTheorem 4.2 Let (M, g) be a connected, simply connected three-dimensional Lorentzian manifold. The following properties are equivalent:\n(i) (M, g) is a g.o. space.\n(ii) (M, g) is naturally reductive.\n(iii) Either (M, g) is symmetric, or it is isometric to a unimodular Lie group G, equipped\nwith a left-invariant Lorentzian metric, having one of the following Lie algebras:\n\u2022 g = g3 , with either \u03b1 = \u03b2 6= \u03b3, \u03b1 = \u03b3 6= \u03b2 or \u03b2 = \u03b3 6= \u03b1.\n\u2022 g = g4 , with \u03b1 = \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b5.\nUnimodular Lie groups admitting one of the Lie algebras listed in Theorem 4.2, can be easily\ndeduced from Tables I and II. Hence, we can get the explicit classification of three-dimensional\nnon-symmetric naturally reductive Lorentzian spaces.\nTheorem 4.3 A three-dimensional connected, simply connected Lorentzian manifold (M, g) is\na non-symmetric naturally reductive space if and only if it is isometric to\na) SL(2, IR),\nb) SU (2),\nc) H3 ,\nequipped with a suitable left-invariant Lorentzian metric.\nIt is worthwhile to compare this result with Theorem 6.5 in [TV], where it was proved that\nSL(2, IR), SU (2) and H3 , equipped with a suitable left-invariant Riemannian metric, are the\nonly three-dimensional naturally reductive non-symmetric Riemannian spaces.\n\nReferences\n[AS]\n\nW.
