We find that, in general, it is not consistent to truncate away these\nmoduli in a simple manner.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nHeterotic M-theory 1,2 is one of the most promising corners of the M-theory\nmoduli space studied to date from a phenomenological point of view. The theS1\nory describes eleven dimensional M-theory compactified on an orbifold Z\n\u00d7X\n2\nwhere X is a manifold of SU (3) holonomy. This compactification combines the\nphenomenological successes of the weakly coupled E8 \u00d7 E8 heterotic string,\ncompactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold, with a natural mechanism for obtaining the correct strength of both the gravitational and gauge interactions\nsimultaneously.\nThe vacua of heterotic M-theory are non-trivial background solutions which\ninclude two key features 1,2,3 . These are a warping of the bulk fields in the orbifold direction and the presence of non trivial gauge field expectation values\non the two orbifold fixed planes.\nDue to the phenomenological success of the theory many authors have\nnaturally been lead to study the moduli evolution of its vacua. However no one\nhas been able to include the moduli describing the background section of the\ngauge bundle in these dynamical analyses due to the simple fact that the kinetic\nterms for these fields have not been known (although some superpotentials have\nbeen computed for such moduli 4,5 ).\nThe reason for the lack of a four dimensional theory describing these moduli in the literature is easy to understand. The most direct way in which to\ncalculate the required four dimensional kinetic terms would be to perform a\nstandard dimensional reduction about a solution describing the vacuum, including the gauge field expectation values. However, such a vacuum solution\n1\n\n\fis simply not known explicitly.\nThe aim of this talk is to present the first example of a four dimensional\ntheory which includes the kinetic terms for some of these elusive bundle moduli.\nThese results were derived in a recent paper 6 . We shall focus on the moduli\ndescribing a particular type of gauge field configuration known as a gauge five\nbrane. This is a six dimensional solitonic object which is essentially a Yang\nMills instanton - a localised lump of gauge field - dressed up with various other\nfields.\nThe plan of this talk is as follows. In section 2 we briefly outline the method\nwhich has been used to obtain the four dimensional effective action including\nthe gauge five brane moduli. The action itself is presented, and its physical\nconsequences discussed, in section 3. Finally some promising directions for\nfuture research are described in section 4.\n2\n\nObtaining the effective action\n\nIn deriving the effective theory describing the gauge five brane moduli in four\ndimensions we have to get around the fact that a full background solution\ndescribing the embedding of the soliton within the vacuum is not known. The\nway we have circumvented this deficiency is based upon the fact that the soliton\nis a localised object in its transverse space 6 .\nIn any given vacuum configuration the gauge five brane we are interested\nin must be oriented in a specific manner in order to preserve N = 1 supersymmetry in four dimensions 1 . Four of its six worldvolume directions must span\nthe external Minkowski space. The remaining two world volume directions\nwrap a holomorphic curve within the Calabi-Yau leaving five directions within\nthe compactification manifold, including the orbifold direction, to make up the\nspace transverse to the object. The localised nature of the gauge five brane\nmeans that, in some sense, it does not probe the compactification manifold\nin the directions transverse to it's world volume at distances which are much\ngreater than the width of its core. As we shall see this reduces the requirement\nin our calculation for a solution describing the entire vacuum to a need to find\na solution which is valid only near to the branes world volume. This is a much\nsimpler task as we will now describe.\n2.1\n\nWrapping up the gauge five brane\n\nThe calculation is most easily preformed within the ten dimensional effective\ndescription of heterotic M-theory in which the orbifold direction has been integrated out 7 . Using this effective theory as our starting point also means that\nour results are equally valid for the weakly coupled heterotic string theories\n2\n\n\fwhen we make appropriate modifications to the numerical values of certain\nparameters and a suitable modification of the gauge group in the SO(32) case.\nIn this talk we shall continue to describe everything in the strongly coupled\nlanguage however for simplicity and unity of presentation.\nThe solution describing a gauge five brane in ten dimensional asymptotically flat space is well known 8 . We need to wrap this uncompactified configuration up in a suitable manner on a 2 cycle in a compact manifold. This can\nbe achieved by wrapping up the brane on a Calabi-Yau threefold constructed\nas the resolution of an appropriate orbifold. In our recent paper 6 a six dimensional orbifold was used with the property that (in addition to having SU (3)\nholonomy) near the Riemann surface, C2 , on which we are going to wrap our\ngauge five brane the compact space may be written as X = C2 \u00d7 C4 , where C4\nis a complex four dimensional space.\nAn example of such an orbifold is a Z8 \u2212 I Coexeter orbifold with a\nSO(5) \u00d7 SO(9) lattice. The identifications required to turn flat space into\nthis orbifold which are associated with the two cycle C2 are consistent with the\ngauge five brane solutions symmetries and so may be performed trivially. The\nidentifications made in the space transverse to the brane are not consistent\nwith the symmetries of the asymptotically flat solution. However, this merely\nmeans that we must modify the configuration at large distances from the core\nof the object and we shall now see that we do not require a solution which is\nvalid in these regions.\nGiven this solution (valid near to the gauge five branes world volume) for\nthe background configuration one may then proceed to dimensionally reduce in\nthe usual way. We promote integration constants to be four dimensional fields\nand integrate over the compactified extra dimensions in order to obtain a four\ndimensional effective action. If it is indeed the case that we only require a\nbackground solution for the gauge five brane which is valid near to the objects\nworld volume then we should find that the result we get is independent of the\ngauge five branes contributions to the vacuum far out in the transverse space.\nWe find that this is indeed the case, thus justifying our approach. The level of\napproximation involved is determined by a well controlled expansion which is\ndescribed in the next section.\nIn fact a number of subtleties arise in performing the dimensional reduction\nwhich we have not mentioned here. These subtleties are described in detail in\nour recent paper 6 .\n3\n\n\f3\n\nThe four dimensional action, K\u00e4hler potential and complex structure\n\nThe four dimensional effective action we obtain from the procedure outlined\nin the previous section is as follows 6 .\n\nS=\n\n1\n2\u03ba24\n\n\u0012\n\u0001\n\u221a\n1\n1\n(1)\n(\u2202\u03b21 )2 + (\u2202\u03b22 )2 + (\u2202\u03b23 )2\nd4 x \u2212g \u2212R + (\u2202\u03c6)2 +\n2\n2\n\u0001\n2 \u22122\u03b21\n(\u2202\u03c71 )2 + e\u22122\u03b22 (\u2202\u03c72 )2 + e\u22122\u03b23 (\u2202\u03c73 )2\ne\n+e\u22122\u03c6 (\u2202\u03c3)2 +\n9\nh\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2212\u03b21 \u2212\u03b22\n(\u2202\u03c1)2 + \u03c12 (\u2202\u03b8)2 + \u03c12 e\u2212\u03b21 \u2212\u03b22 (\u2202\u03b21 )2 + (\u2202\u03b22 )2\n+qG5 8e\n\nZ\n\n\u0001\n2\n\u22124\u03c1e\u2212\u03b21 \u2212\u03b22 \u2202\u03c1 (\u2202\u03b21 + \u2202\u03b22 ) \u2212 \u03c12 e\u2212\u03b21 \u2212\u03b22 e\u22122\u03b21 (\u2202\u03c71 )2 + e\u22122\u03b22 (\u2202\u03c72 )2\n9\n4\n+ \u03c12 e\u22122\u03b21 \u22122\u03b22 \u2202\u03c71 \u2202\u03c72\n9\n\u0015\u0013\n8 2 \u2212\u03b21 \u2212\u03b22 2 1\n\u2212\u03b22\n1\n2\n3\n4\n4\n3\n\u2212\u03b21\n+ \u03c1 e\n\u2202\u03c72 )\n\u2202\u03c71 + e\n(\u03b8 \u2202\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8 \u2202\u03b8 + \u03b8 \u2202\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8 \u2202\u03b8 )(e\n3\nThis expression employs the following definition.\n\n(\u2202\u03b8)2 =\n\n4\nX\n\n(\u2202\u03b8\u03b3 )2\n\n(2)\n\n\u03b3=1\n\nIn this result we have the following fields in addition to the four dimensional\nmetric. Firstly we have the familiar moduli fields of four dimensional heterotic\nM-theory 2 . The dilaton field is denoted by \u03c6 and its associated axion is \u03c3. The\nmetric moduli describing our Calabi-Yau manifold are \u03b2i where i = 1, 2, 3. The\nsize of the 2 cycle which the gauge five brane wraps is determined by \u03b23 whereas\n\u03b21 and \u03b22 are associated with the transverse space. The axions associated with\nthese fields are \u03c7i . The moduli describing the blow ups of the orbifold fixed\nloci have been truncated.\nIn addition to these geometrical moduli we have the bundle moduli describing the gauge five brane.\nP4 These are \u03c1, which describes the solitons width, and\n\u03b8\u03b3 where \u03b3 = 1..4 and \u03b3=1 (\u03b8\u03b3 )2 = 1, which describe the orientation of the objects gauge field core within SU (2). We have also introduced qG5 = \u03b1\u2032 (2\u03c0)2 /Vt\nand Vt is the coordinate volume of the transverse space to the five brane.\nThe approximations we have made in obtaining this result are as follows.\nWe have made all of the standard approximations employed in obtaining four\n4\n\n\fdimensional actions in this context. These are the slowly changing moduli approximation, working to first order in \u03b1\u2032 (or more precisely to first order in \u01ebw\nin the language used in the literature 9 ) and ignoring towers of massive states\n(which corresponds to 'the other' \u01eb expansion 9 ). The action also does not\ninclude contributions from non-perturbative corrections. The new approxima1\ntion that we have made here is that \u03c1 << Vt 6 (there could be corrections to\n1\n\nour action which are suppressed by powers of \u03c12 /Vt 3 ). In addition, in order for\nour supergravity description to be valid we require \u03c12 >> \u03b1\u2032 . In other words\nthe gauge five brane has to be wide enough to be describable by supergravity\nbut narrow enough to be viewed as a localised object. This leaves us with a\nwide range of five brane widths for which our results are valid.\nSince the four dimensional action has been constructed to be N = 1 supersymmetric it can be written in terms of a K\u00e4hler potential and an associated\ncomplex structure.\nK = \u2212 ln(S + S\u0304) \u2212 ln(T1 + T\u03041 ) \u2212 ln(T2 + T\u03042 )\n\u0001\n16\u03b1\u2032 |C1 |2 + |C2 |2\n\u2212 ln(T3 + T\u03043 ) + q\n\u0001\n\u0001\nT1 + T\u03041 T2 + T\u03042\n\nC1 = e\u2212\n\nT2 =\nT3 =\nS=\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b22\n4\n\n\u03b21\n4\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b22\n4\n\n(Y1 + iY2 )\n\n(Y3 + iY4 )\n\u0001\n\u03b21 \u2212\u03b22\n2\ne\u03b21 + i\u03c71 + 4\u03b1\u2032 e 2\n|C1 |2 + |C2 |2\n3\n\u0001\n\u03b22 \u2212\u03b21\n2\n\u03b22\n|C1 |2 + |C2 |2\ne + i\u03c72 + 4\u03b1\u2032 e 2\n3\n2\n\u03b23\ne + i\u03c73\n\u221a3\ne\u03c6 + 2i\u03c3\n\nC2 = e\nT1 =\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b21\n4\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\n(8)\n(9)\n\nHere we have defined the fields Y\u03b3 as Y\u03b3 = \u03c1\u03b8\u03b3 . We see that we have\nthe usual K\u00e4hler potential of heterotic M-theory with an additional term, the\nfinal one, which is due to the presence of the gauge five brane. Similarly the\ndefinitions of the T superfields in terms of component fields are just the usual\nones with a couple of modifications at O(\u03b1\u2032 ) due to the presence of the gauge\nfive-brane.\nWe can make a number of comments about the physics that follows from\nthese results purely from an examination of the component action and K\u00e4hler\nstructure.\n5\n\n\fFirst of all it is clearly not consistent, in the case of the compactifications\nconsidered here, to take the universal case for the metric moduli in the presence\nof a generic changing instanton configuration. In other words, due to the non\ntrivial factors of e\u03b21 and e\u03b22 in the gauge five brane moduli kinetic terms, for\nexample, it is inconsistent to set \u03b21 = \u03b22 = \u03b23 (however as we shall see shortly\nwe can set \u03b21 = \u03b22 if we make some compatible truncations of the other fields).\nSecondly it can be seen from the last five terms in equation (1) that it\nis not consistent to truncate off the gauge five brane moduli by setting them\nto be non-zero constants. In fact it is not possible to truncate them away\nby setting all the Y 's to zero either, even though they appear bilinearly in\nthe above expressions. This is because setting all of the Y 's to zero in this\nmanner corresponds to setting \u03c1 to zero and as mentioned above our effective\ndescription is not valid in this region of moduli space.\nMore complicated forms of truncation are possible in certain special cases.\nThe simplest consistent truncation we may obtain of equation (1) which includes the gauge five brane's size modulus, the field we are perhaps most\ninterested in, is given below.\n1\nS= 2\n2\u03ba\n\nZ\n\n\u0001\n\u221a\nd4 x \u2212g \u2212R + (\u2202\u03b2)2 + 8q5 e\u2212\u03b2 (\u2202 \u03c1\u0302)2\n\n(10)\n\nHere we have taken \u03b21 = \u03b22 = \u03b2,\u03c71 , \u03c72 , \u03c73 , \u03c6, \u03c3, \u03b23 and \u03b8\u03b3 to be zero and we\n\u03b2\nhave defined \u03c1\u0302 = e\u2212 2 \u03c1.\nThis action provides a simple starting point for an investigation of the\ndynamics associated with the bundle modulus \u03c1 and will be at the heart of\nsome future work 10 .\n4\n\nFuture work\n\nThere are many ways in which this work can be used as a basis for future\nstudy. Here we will describe a few of the more exciting possibilities.\nOne could generalise the results presented here to the case where we consider more than one, possibly overlapping, gauge five brane. Such complicated\nsituations are probably tractable due to the fact that we have a very powerful\nmechanism for obtaining the self dual gauge field configurations on which such\nobjects are based in the form of the ADHM construction 11 . Similar calculations to the one presented here could be performed for these more complicated\nsituations. Indeed by using a Kummer style construction for the Calabi-Yau\nthreefold, such as the one we have employed here, and by taking the case where\nthe gauge field background is entirely in the form of (either overlapping or not\n6\n\n\foverlapping) gauge five branes one could write down a four dimensional theory\nwhich includes all of the moduli present in the compactification.\nThere are other possible constituents of the gauge bundle which would\nyield to our approach. For example there is another localised object which\ntakes a Yang-Mills instanton as its core - the so called symmetric solution 12 .\nWe could equally well apply our method to this object and obtain the low\nenergy effective theory which includes its moduli.\nOne could try to obtain a more complete description of the gauge five\nbrane's four dimensional effective theory by combining the kinetic terms described here with the work which has been done on obtaining non-perturbative\nsuperpotentials for gauge bundle moduli 4,5 . In particular it would be interesting to identify the moduli in these papers which correspond to those described\nhere, for example the instanton size.\nThe action presented in this paper could be used to derive a number of\ndifferent types of cosmological solutions. For example one could seek to describe the cosmological effects of a gauge five brane spreading out with time 10\nor spinning in SU (2) space. Such solutions could be of critical importance in\ncertain cosmological scenarios 13,14 .\nOur results could be used to improve the description of cosmological scenarios where the gauge five brane is created as the result of a small instanton\ntransition 13,14 . However we would like to stress that these objects can live on\nthe orbifold fixed planes irrespective of whether or not the system has undergone such phase transitions. Therefore it is possible to base scenarios purely\non the dynamics of gauge five branes. For example, if we were to include the\nposition moduli of the five brane in our analysis we could imagine basing some\nkind of brane inflation scenario on gauge five branes and anti gauge five branes.\nThis soliton-antisoliton inflation could potentially have some quite nice properties. For example when inflation ends with the collision of the instanton and\nanti instanton they would presumably annihilate in a manner which is describable within the regime of low energy field theory - both objects simply being\nmade out of low energy fields a . The energy from such an annihilation could\nreheat the universe - the fact that the colliding objects are annihilating on an\norbifold fixed plane presumably means that it would be natural for a sizable\nproportion of the resulting energy to be dumped into matter fields.\nIn other words gauge five branes can be every bit as useful in developing\nvarious scenarios as their 'fundamental' counterparts - and in addition these\na Although\n\nsome caution is called for with this statement given the results presented in the\nliterature for a situation which one would think would be subject to similar arguments 15 .\nThe two situations are different however. In particular in our case the two colliding objects\nwould have no net five brane charge.\n\n7\n\n\fsolitonic objects have extra attractive features such as variable widths and the\nfact that they are entirely built out of low energy fields.\nIn short it is now possible to start an analysis of the effect of certain types\nof gauge bundle moduli on different cosmological scenarios for the first time.\nAcknowledgements\nJG is supported by a Sir James Knott fellowship and would like to thank the\nCPT at the University of Durham for their hospitality while this talk was being\nwritten up.\nReferences\n1.
