Unfortunately, the limit\nwas derived incorrectly. We point out the shortcomings of this analysis and show\nthat the tentative detection of a spectral feature consistent with a 5-keV sterile\nneutrino is not in contradiction with existing limits. Future observations of dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies will test this hypothesis.\nSterile neutrinos with masses of several keV can make up all or most of dark matter (Dodelson & Widrow 1994), can explain the observed velocities of pulsars (Kusenko &\nSegr\u00e8 1997; Fuller et al. 2003; Fryer & Kusenko 2006; Kusenko et al. 2008), and can play\na role in the formation of the first stars and in other astrophysical phenomena (Biermann\n& Kusenko 2006; Kusenko 2009). The first dedicated search for relic sterile neutrinos using\nSuzaku (Loewenstein, Kusenko, & Biermann 2009) and Chandra (Loewenstein & Kusenko\n2009) X-ray telescopes has produced some reliable new limits, as well as a tentative detection\nof a spectral feature consistent with a decay line of a 5 keV sterile neutrino.\nHowever, Boyarsky et al. (2010) have claimed that this detection can be excluded at the\nlevel of 20\u03c3 based on the archival data from observations of M31. The X-ray data used by\nBoyarsky et al. (2010) are the same data that Watson et al. (2006) have used to produce an\nexclusion limit (which is not in disagreement with our result). Obviously, it would be quite\nremarkable if these archival data turned out to be better suited to search for sterile neutrinos\nthan the ongoing and planned dedicated X-ray observations (Loewenstein & Kusenko 2009;\n1\n\nDepartment of Physics and Astronomy, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1547, USA\n\n2\n\nInstitute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe, University of Tokyo, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778568, Japan\n2\n\nDepartment of Astronomy, University of Maryland, College Park, MD.\n\n3\n\nCRESST and X-ray Astrophysics Laboratory NASA/GSFC, Greenbelt, MD.\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nLoewenstein, Kusenko, & Biermann 2009). We examine this claim, and we find it to be\nunfounded.\nThe strength of the expected signal depends on the amount of dark matter in the field\nof view. The strongest results of Boyarsky et al. (2010) were obtained based on the central\nregion of M31. More specifically, they considered a ring with inner and outer radii of 5\u2032 and\n13\u2032 that correspond to 1.1 kpc and 3 kpc, respectively, at the distance of M31. To obtain the\namount of dark matter in this part of their field of view, Boyarsky et al. (2010) considered\nseveral smooth profiles hypothesized in the literature, each of which gives a reasonable, but\nby no means unique, fit to the data. Of these profiles they chose the one that produces the\nlowest projected mass in this annulus, 1.1\u00d71010 M\u2299 , corresponding to a column mass density\nof 606 M\u2299 pc\u22122 . Their alleged exclusion limit is based on the assumption that at least this\nmuch of dark matter falls within the selected region of the field of view. If the amount of\ndark matter is lower by a factor of two or more, their claim is weakened or invalidated, as\nthe expected signal-to-noise ratio decreases accordingly.\nThe problem with the analysis of Boyarsky et al. (2010) is that the smooth profiles they\nchose to consider do not represent the full range of uncertainty in the dark matter content in\ntheir field of view. The mass density in the central region of M31 is known to be dominated\nby baryonic matter. As emphasized by Klypin et al. (2002), a dark matter profile inferred\nfrom cold dark matter simulations is not applicable to the actual dark matter distribution in\nthe central 3 kpc of M31, because the interactions of dark matter with baryons are expected\nto facilitate the angular momentum transfer and expulsion of dark matter from the central\nregion. The presence of a rotating bar in M31 implies that the central density of dark matter\nshould be sufficiently small to avoid causing the dynamical friction that would interfere with\nthe rotating bar (Weinberg 1985; Debattista & Sellwood 2000). The spherical profiles may\nbe incorrect for fitting the data because the dark matter distribution in the central region can\nbe triaxial (H\u00e4fner et al. 2000). Finally, sterile neutrinos have different clustering properties\non small scales from those of cold dark matter (Petraki 2008; Boyanovsky 2008a,b; Boyarsky\net al. 2009), and there are no reliable calculations of dark matter profiles that take into\naccount both the free-streaming of warm dark matter and the effects of the baryons.\nEven aside from all of these caveats, the simplest spherical profiles giving the best fit\nto observational data require much less dark matter in the relevant region than what was\nclaimed by Boyarsky et al. (2010), who fail to consider some of the most recent work on\nthe mass distribution in M31. The baryonic mass, which dominates in the center of M31,\nitself is composed of (at least) two (bulge and disk) components with distinct mass-to-light\n(M/L) ratios that are not known a priori, but must be estimated from optical spectra\nunder various simplifying assumptions about their respective stellar populations. Chemin,\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nCarignan, & Foster (2009) present models that include stellar mass-to-light ratios based on\nstellar population synthesis models that have average column mass densities in the 1.1-3\nkpc annulus \u223c 1.5 times lower than the \"minimum\" value in Boyarsky et al. (2010) (while\nnoting the lack of axisymmetry in the inner regions and presence of a central velocity dip\nin the HI rotation curve, and stating that that all their models \"fail to reproduce the the\nexact shape of the rotation curve\"). A new analysis of M31 based on the recent deep, fulldisk 21-cm imaging survey (Corbelli et al. 2009) shows that the best-fit profile is achieved\nusing the Burkert (1995) parametrization with the scale parameter RB = 77 kpc (for which\n\u03c72 = 0.81 indicates a good fit to the data). For this profile, we obtain 3.4 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 for the\ntotal projected dark matter mass in the 5\u2032 -13\u2032 region of M31. When Corbelli et al. (2009)\nimpose a constraint on the virial mass of M31, their best fit corresponds to RB = 28 kpc, in\nwhich case we obtain 2.9 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 for the total projected dark matter mass in this region,\ncorresponding to a column density of 128 M\u2299 pc\u22122 . In reality, the dark matter content of the\nregion in question could be even smaller than the value obtained from the best-fit profile.\nIn these models, the stellar mass-to-light ratios are higher than in Chemin, Carignan, &\nFoster (2009); and indeed, a recent study (Saglia et al. 2010) supports such a higher M/L\nin the bulge that dominates the stellar mass in the central regions. The M31 rotation curve\nis clearly consistent with a dark matter mass and column density that are factor > 4 below\nwhat Boyarsky et al. (2010) have claimed to be the minimal mass and the minimal density.\nSince the minimal dark matter mass in the region chosen by Boyarsky et al. (2010) is at\nleast 4 times smaller than the value they have assumed, the expected minimal intensity of\nthe decay line should be scaled down by at least a factor of 4. Such a properly scaled feature\nfalls well below the Galactic and Cosmic X-ray backgrounds, and it is completely swamped\nby the noise, making impossible the derivation of any robust exclusion limit. At these levels,\nunresolved hard X-ray emission from low-mass X-ray binaries and other stellar (and possibly\ninterstellar) sources come into play (Bogdan & Gilfanov 2008), which may complicate the\nexpected shape of the > 2 keV continuum. These additional components are completely\nabsent in the ultra-faint dwarf spheroidals (Loewenstein, Kusenko, & Biermann 2009), such\nas Willman 1. Unlike the case of M31, dark matter predominates in these systems, and\nthe dark matter distribution is fully determined by kinematics without the uncertainties\nintroduced by the presence of multiple mass components.\nFor the reasons stated above, M31 is not as good a target for future observations as\ndwarf spheroidal galaxies. The ongoing and planned observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies\ngive the best opportunity to confirm or rule out 5 keV sterile neutrinos as a dark matter\ncandidate.\nSupport for this work was provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administra-\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\ntion through Chandra Award Numbers G08-9091X and G09-0090X issued by the Chandra\nX-ray Observatory Center, which is operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory\nfor and on behalf of the National Aeronautics Space Administration under contract NAS803060.
