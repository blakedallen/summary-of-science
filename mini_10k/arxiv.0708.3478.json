For example, OB stars\ndeposit stellar radiation energy into the interstellar medium (ISM) with the\n6\nluminosity of 104 <\n\u223c 10 and the H Lymann-limit photon luminosity\n\u223c L\u2217 /L\u2299 <\n50 \u22121\n47 \u22121 <\n(h\u03bd > 13.6eV) of 10 s \u223c QH <\n\u223c 10 s (Smith, 2006). So the radiative\nfeedback of an early type star during the main sequence (\u03c4MS \u223c 106 yrs) may\namount up to \u223c 1051\u221252 ergs, which is comparable to typical SN explosion\nenergy.\nThese stars also inject mechanical energy into the ISM via stellar winds during\nthe main sequence (MS) and the red supergiant (RSG) or luminous blue variable (LBV) phase, and also Wolf-Rayet stage in the case of very massive stars\nwith M\u2217 > 25 M\u2299 (Chu et al., 2004). The MS winds have a typical wind speed\nof vw \u223c 1000\u22122500 km s\u22121 and a mass loss rate of \u1e40w \u223c 10\u22127 \u221210\u22126 M\u2299 yr \u22121 ,\nwhile the RSG winds have much lower speed, vw \u223c 10 \u2212 50 km s\u22121 , but higher\nmass loss rate, \u1e40 \u223c 10\u22125 \u2212 10\u22124 M\u2299 yr \u22121 (Chu et al., 2004; Dwarkadas, 2005;\nSmith, 2006). Owing to much longer duration the MS wind generates a bigger\nbubble, while the RSG wind produces a much smaller but denser shell inside\nthe MS bubble created earlier. The mechanical energy luminosity of the MS\nwinds ranges 100 <\n\u223c 3000 (Smith, 2006).\n\u223c Lwind /L\u2299 <\nMassive stars with mass M >\n\u223c 8M\u2299 end their lives as core-collapse SNe and\ndeposit typically ESN \u223c 1051 ergs in the form of kinetic energy of the ejecta.\nInitially the SN ejecta expands freely into the wind-blown cavity and later\ninteracts with the shell produced previously by the winds, generating various\nshocks, e.g., transmitted and reflected shocks. Most of the explosion energy\nis thermalized via such shocks. After the shock-heated gas cools adiabatically\ndown to 106 K or after the forward ejecta shock catches up with the wind\nbubble shell, the supernova remnant (SNR) begins to lose a significant fraction\nof thermal energy via radiative cooling. The final energy budget deposited\ninto the surrounding medium in the forms of thermal, kinetic, and radiative\nenergy depends on the detailed history of radiative cooling and heat transport\nby thermal conduction, which in turn depends on the size and structure of the\npreexisting wind bubble as well as on the ambient ISM. For example, if a SN\nexplodes in a dense environment, the explosion energy would be lost mostly by\nradiative cooling and the impact to the ISM should be minimal. According to\nTenorio et al. (1990b), in the case of SN explosions inside wind-blown bubbles\nin the typical ISM with nH,0 = 1 cm\u22123 , the remaining kinetic energy fraction\nis Ek \u223c 0.3ESN at the end of SNR evolution, while the remaining thermal\nenergy fraction, Eth \u223c 0.2 \u2212 0.4ESN .\n2\n\n\fFeedback from massive stars should play a significant role in the formation and\nevolution of galaxies. Especially, feedback from the first-generation SNe affects\nthe formation and evolution of proto-galaxies and the large scale structure in\nthe early Universe (e.g., Kay et al., 2002; Scannapieco et al., 2006, and references therein). Although SN feedback is an important ingredient for galaxy\nformation, it occurs typically on length and time scales much smaller than grid\nspacings and time steps of numerical simulations. So such subgrid physics is\noften treated through phenomenological prescriptions in numerical simulations\nfor galaxy formation and large scale structure formation (Cen & Ostriker,\n2006). Either 'thermal' feedback (e.g., Katz, 1992) or 'kinetic' feedback (e.g.,\nNavarro & White, 1993) with a feedback efficiency parameter 0 < \u01eb < 1,\nwhich is the fraction of SN explosion energy deposited in the form thermal\nor kinetic energy, were tried with varying degrees of success. For a thermal\nfeedback model, the radiative cooling must be turned off artificially for a period of time in order to prevent the dense gas from re-radiating the deposited\nenergy immediately. Kay et al. (2002) showed that both thermal and kinetic\nfeedback models can alleviate the so-called \"catastrophic cooling\" problem of\ngalaxy formation. Thus in order to construct a physical subgrid prescription\nfor SN feedback in numerical studies of galaxy formation it is necessary to\nestimate quantitatively the feedback efficiency parameters, \u01ebth , \u01ebkin , and \u01ebrad\nfor thermal, kinetic and radiation energy, respectively.\n\nMassive stars often form in an association, so multiple explosions of corecollapse SNe can create a large superbubble (Tomisaka & Ikeuchi, 1986; Tenorio et al.,\n1990a; Smith & Cox, 2001). Multiple SN explosions in the proto-galactic environment, in particular, may have played a significant role in the formation\nof halo globular clusters. In a self-enrichment model of metal-poor globular\nclusters, proto-globular cluster clouds are assumed to be enriched by multiple\nSN explosions from massive first-generation stars contained within the clouds\nand later second-generation stars form in the cooled shell driven by the SN explosions (e.g., Parmetier et al., 1999, and references therein). However, some\nhave argued that the binding energy of a proto-globular cluster cloud may not\nbe large enough to survive a few SNe, and that the homogeneity of metalicity\nwithin a globular cluster indicates that pre-enrichment must have occurred\nwithin larger systems (Searle & Zinn, 1978). According to numerical studies\nof early structure formation, first objects might form at a redshift of \u223c 30 with\na typical mass of 106 M\u2299 and first-generation stars enrich the protogalactic\nclouds before they merge into larger clouds of 1012 M\u2299 via gravitational clustering (Bromm & Larson, 2004). This favors the model that combines the preenrichment by first stars before the formation of protogalactic halos and the\nself-enrichment by next generation SNe within proto-globular cluster clouds.\nIn this scenario the stability of the cooled shell and further star formation\ncritically depends on how efficiently the SN energy is radiated away during\nthe SNR evolution.\n3\n\n\fThus in the present work we attempt to estimate feedback effects of corecollapse SNe, including multiple detonation, through numerical hydrodynamic\nsimulations. We first calculate the creation of a bubble by stellar winds from\nmultiple massive stars (Nstar = 1 \u2212 50) during the precedent MS stage. The\nend results of the MS wind stage are adopted as the initial states of the SN\nexplosion simulations. We then make quantitative estimates of the fractions of\nexplosion energy transferred into the ISM in different forms, i.e., thermal, kinetic, and radiation energy. Diffuse radiation emitted by the shock-heated gas,\nespecially, ionizing radiation for hydrogen and helium atoms are calculated.\nIn \u00a72, the basic features of our numerical simulations, including radiative cooling and thermal conduction, are described. We then present the numerical\nresults of wind bubble models in \u00a73, and multiple supernova models in \u00a74. A\nbrief summary is given in \u00a75.\n\n2\n\nNumerical Method\n\n2.1 Hydrodynamic Equations\nWe solve the hydrodynamic conservation equations of the ideal gas in onedimensional spherical coordinate system, including radiative cooling and thermal conduction :\n\u2202\u03c1\n1 \u2202\n+ 2 (r 2 \u03c1u) = 0,\n\u2202t r \u2202r\n\n(1)\n\n\u2202(\u03c1u)\n1 \u2202\n\u2202P\n+ 2 (r 2 \u03c1u2 ) = \u2212\n,\n\u2202t\nr \u2202r\n\u2202r\n\n(2)\n\ni\n\u2202(\u03c1e)\n1 \u2202\n1 \u2202 h 2\nr (\u03c1eu + P u) = \u2212\u039b \u2212 2 (r 2 S),\n+ 2\n\u2202t\nr \u2202r\nr \u2202r\n\n(3)\n\nwhere u is the radial velocity, e = P/[\u03c1(\u03b3 \u2212 1)] + u2 /2 is the total energy of\nthe gas per unit mass, \u039b is the energy loss rate per unit volume, and S is the\nradial heat flux. A ratio of specific heats is assumed to be \u03b3 = 5/3. The gas\ntemperature is determined by T = \u03bcmH P/(\u03c1kB ), where kB is Boltzmann's\nconstant, mH is the mass of hydrogen nucleus and \u03bc is the mean molecular\nweight.\nWe use a grid-based, Eulerian hydrodynamics code in the spherical symmetric geometry, based on the Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) scheme\n(Ryu et al., 1993). The TVD scheme solves a hyperbolic system of gasdynamical conservation equations with a second-order accuracy. It has been widely\n4\n\n\fused for a variety of astrophysical problems (e.g., Baek et al., 2003).\n\n2.2 Radiative Cooling and Thermal Conduction\n\nWe define the cooling rate as\n\u039b(T, nH ) = L(T )n2H\n\n(4)\n\nwhere nH is the number density of hydrogen nuclei. For the cooling rate coefficient, L(T ), we adopt the non-equilibrium radiative cooling rate for an optically thin gas that is calculated by following the non-equilibrium collisional\nionization of the gas cooling from 108.5 K to 104 K under the isobaric condition (Sutherland & Dopita, 1993). We consider cases with the solar metalicity\n( Z\u2299 ) and with 1/10 of the solar metalicity (0.1 Z\u2299 ).\nAlthough we calculate diffuse radiation emitted by the shock-heated gas, we\ndo not explicitly follow the radiative transfer of diffuse radiation and photoionization of the gas. Instead we assume L(T ) = 0 for T \u2264 104 K and set the\nminimum temperature at Tmin = 104 K. This is in effect equivalent to assuming thermal equilibrium at 104 K between radiative cooling and photoionization\nheating.\nAfter completing the hydrodynamic part, updating hydrodynamical quantities, radiative cooling is applied to the thermal energy per unit volume, E, as\na separate step (Baek et al., 2003):\nE n+1 = E n * exp(\u2212\n\n\u2206t\n)\ntcool\n\n(5)\n\nwhere tcool = E/\u039b is the cooling time scale and \u2206t is the integration time\nstep. This is designed to follow approximately the thermal history of the gas\nthat cools radiatively and approaches the specified minimum temperature in\na time scale much shorter than the dynamical time scale (LeVeque, 1997).\nIn some astrophysical plasmas such as solar corona and stellar winds thermal conduction can be important in heat transport. We include the so-called\nclassical Spitzer conduction for a fully ionized gas (Spitzer, 1962):\nScl = \u2212k\u2207r T ,\nk=\n\n(6)\n\n1.84 \u00d7 10\u22125T 5/2\n,\nln \u039bc\n\n(7)\n\n5\n\n\fwhere ln \u039bc = 29.7 + ln ne\u22121/2 (T /106K) and ne is the electron number density.\nThis classical formula is based on the assumption that the mean free path of\nthe electrons is short compared to temperature scale height. However, when\ntemperature scale height is comparable or shorter than the electron mean\nfree path, thermal conduction reaches the saturation limit and heat flux is no\nlonger equal to k\u2207r T . In the saturation limit, heat flux is given approximately\nby\nSsat \u2248 \u22120.4(\n\n2kB T 1/2\n) ne kB T,\n\u03c0me\n\n(8)\n\nwhere me is the electron mass (Cowie & McKee, 1977). So we set S = min[Scl , Ssat ]\nas local heat flux.\nWith the classical formula the thermal conduction term becomes a diffusion\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\nterm, \u2207 r * (k \u2207 r T ). This type of partial differential equation can be solved\nimplicitly by Cranck-Nicholson Scheme (Press et al., 1992). For the saturated\nformula, however, this cannot be applied. So we solve the thermal conduction\nterm explicitly and the integration time step is chosen as\nE\n\u2206r\n\u2206tn = 0.1 * min( \u2192\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u2192 , |u \u00b1 c | ),\n|\u2207r * S |\ns\n\n(9)\n\nwhere cs = (\u03b3P/\u03c1)1/2 is the sound speed.\nIn grid-based Eulerian simulations a shock transition is typically resolved over\nseveral grid zones with a strong temperature gradient, although the physical\nshock thickness may be much smaller than the size of one grid zone. So unphysically rapid radiative cooling and heat transport can occur across the\nnumerical shock transition zones. To avoid such numerical artifacts, we identify\nzones that undergo shocking process and turn off radiative cooling and heat\ntransport by thermal conduction inside those zones.\nWe neglect magnetic fields and dust in our calculations. If there exist dynamically significant, regular magnetic fields in the ambient medium, the assumed spherical symmetry would brake down. Also coherent tangential magnetic fields would substantially reduce the radial thermal conduction flux.\nDust may play some important roles through radiation pressure on dust and\ndust cooling in the cooled bubble shell in a more realistic situation. Proper\ntreatments of such processes require radiative transfer, chemistry and dust\nformation/destruction, which are beyond the scope of this study. However, if\nthe bubble shell stays photoionized at 104 K by diffuse radiation, as we assume\nhere, then the effects of dust are likely to be minimal. Smith & Cox (2001),\nfor example, included dust cooling in their simulations of multiple SNe and\nfound that the dust cooling effects were only minor.\n6\n\n\f3\n\nDevelopment of Wind Bubbles\n\n3.1 Wind Models\nWe first consider the development of a wind bubble to study the pre-supernova\ncircumstellar environment. Massive early-type stars emit a steady stellar wind\nwith constant terminal velocity Vw and mass-loss rate M \u0307 w = dMw /dt. We assume that the progenitor star has an initial mass 15M\u2299 and spends \u2206tw =\n4 \u00d7 106 yr in the main sequence phase. The MS wind is characterized with a\nmass-loss rate, M \u0307 w = 2.5\u00d710\u22127 M\u2299 yr \u22121, and wind velocity, Vw = 2000 km s\u22121\n(Smith, 2006). Here we consider only the MS wind, since the RSG wind produces a small shell with the radius of a few pc inside the bubble created by the\nMS wind. The RSG wind shell would be swept up quickly by the SN ejecta\nduring the early free expansion stage, so interactions of the ejecta with this\nshell can be ignored.\nWe calculate the evolution of a bubble blown by collective stellar winds from\nmultiple massive stars in an association. The luminosity of the collective wind\nis the key physical parameter that determines the properties and evolution of\nthe bubble and it is given by\n1\nLw = M \u0307 w Vw2 * Nstar = Nstar * (3.17 \u00d7 1035 ergs\u22121 ).\n2\n\n(10)\n\nWe select the number of stars, Nstar = 1, 5, 10, 30 and 50, because a typical OB\nassociation contains 10-100 early-type stars (see Table 1). In a realistic model,\none needs to specify the initial mass function of the association to obtain a\ntotal wind luminosity. In our simplified model, however, Lw , is parameterized\nwith Nstar . So a larger value of Lw can be regarded as a higher wind luminosity\neither from a more massive star or from multiple stars.\nWe consider nH,0 = 1 cm\u22123 as the fiducial density of the ambient ISM (WF\nmodels), where \u03c10 = (2.34\u00d710\u221224 g)nH,0 . Two additional values are considered:\nnH,0 = 0.3 cm\u22123 (WL01 model) and 3 cm\u22123 (WH01 model). The ambient\nmedium is assumed to be photoionized at T = 104 K. So its sound speed is\ncs = 14 km s\u22121 and the pressure is PISM = 2.3 \u00d7 10\u221212 erg cm\u22123 . With WZ01\nand WZ10 models, we consider metal poor cases with 0.1 Z\u2299 .\nThe wind is realized numerically by injecting the gas flow with Vw at the inner\nboundary (rw ) of the spherical simulation grid. The wind density at the inner\nboundary is given by \u03c1w = Nstar * [M \u0307 w /(4\u03c0Vw rw2 )]. We use Nr = 3000 uniform\nspherical grid zones in 150 pc radius with a spatial grid spacing of \u2206r = 0.05\npc. Numerical convergence is often an important issue for hydrodynamic simulations with radiative cooling, because the cooling rate has a strong density\n7\n\n\fdependence (i.e., \u039b \u221d \u03c12 ). So in order to test numerical convergence of the\nsimulations WF01 model is calculated with several different grid spacings. Fig.\n1 shows the structure of the bubble in the simulations with 3 different grid\nspacings. The contact discontinuity (CD) between the shocked wind and the\nshocked ISM is around 23 pc, while the location of the conduction front (CF)\nis different in the three simulations. The size of the hot cavity (\u223c 20pc) is\n1/2\nsmaller than the so-called Field length \u03bbF = [kT /(n2H L)] \u2248 56 pc, where\nT \u223c 106 K and nH \u223c 0.01 cm\u22123 are used (Begelman & McKee, 1990). So heat\ntransport by thermal conduction is dominant over radiative cooling inside the\ncavity. Heat transport from the hot shocked wind gas to the warm shocked ISM\nreduces the temperature of the shocked wind gas, triggering radiative cooling\nand compression. These processes are not followed accurately enough to be\nconverged in the simulations, so the density and temperature distributions\nare significantly different inside the cavity among these simulations. However,\nthe pressure distribution is very similar in the three calculations and so the\ndynamical evolution of the wind bubble shell seems to be converged. Radial\npositions of the CD and outer compression wave seem to be converged within\na few percent, while the total energy inside the simulation volume seems to\nbe converged within \u223c 10 %. This fast convergence is achieved, because the\ndensity compression factor at the shell is not very large in the simulations\n(\u03c1shell /\u03c10 <\n\u223c 10). We also find that the differences in the density and temperature structures inside the cavity among the simulations with different grid\nspacings do not affect significantly the evolution of SN explosions that will be\ndescribed in \u00a74.2.\n\n3.2 Evolution of Wind Bubbles\n\nA typical bubble has four distinct regions from the central star outward: 1)\nfreely expanding wind with the density profile, \u03c1 \u221d r \u22122 , 2) a wind termination\nshock facing inward and the shocked wind region, 3) a contact discontinuity\n(CD) between the shocked wind region and the shocked ISM region, 4) a\nforward shock propagating into the ambient ISM (Weaver et al., 1977). While\nthe termination shock is strong, a compression wave may form, instead of\nthe outer forward shock, depending on the ratio of wind ram pressure to the\nambient pressure.\nFig. 2 shows the gas density and temperature profiles at t = 106 years in\nthe models listed in Table 1. Although the outermost structure is initially\ndeveloped as a weak shock for all models, it becomes a compression wave with\nthe propagation speed, v <\n\u223c cs in some models, as the bubble expands out into\nthe ambient medium. For WF01 model, for example, the pressure increases\nonly by a factor of 1.5 across the compression wave. Even for WF50 model\nthe outer shock speeds is only vs \u223c 20 km s\u22121 . Also the shock transition\n8\n\n\fis much wider than that typically found in adiabatic simulations using the\nsame TVD code. In WF50 model the inner termination shock is at 10 pc, the\nconduction front at \u223c 25 pc, the CD at 41 pc, and the outer shock wave at\nRbs \u223c 45 pc. Without thermal conduction, the hot cavity inside the CD would\nbe almost isothermal with T \u2248 107.6\u22127.8 K. But heat transport by thermal\nconduction enhances radiative cooling near the conduction front, leading to a\nstrong temperature gradient inside the cavity.\nNear the CD, the gas density changes by more than two orders of magnitude,\nso the gas cools quickly down to Tmin = 104 K and forms a shell. The thickness\nof the shell is rather thick (\u2206Rbs \u223c 0.3Rbs ). The continuous injection of wind\nenergy seems to be radiated away efficiently near the conduction front. For a\nspherical shell with inner radius, Rbs,i = \u03b1Rbs , outer radius, Rbs , and uniform\ndensity, the shell density can be derived from the condition that the shell mass\nis equal to the swept-up mass:\nnshell\n\u2248 (1 \u2212 \u03b13 )\u22121 .\nnH,0\n\n(11)\n\nSo the density enhancement factor is small for thick shells found in our simulations. For WF01 model, for example, \u03b1 \u2248 0.7 and nshell /nH,0 \u2248 1.5.\nFrom Fig. 2 we can see that the size of bubble increases with Nstar and decreases with nH,0 . Weaver et al. (1977) showed that the bubble would evolve\n\u22121/5 3/5\nself-similarly and the outer radius of the shell would grow as Rbs \u221d L1/5\nt ,\nw \u03c10\nif radiative cooling and the ambient pressure were negligible. They also derived\na slightly modified time dependence of Rbs \u221d t0.58 by numerical integrations\nof simplified conservation equations where an approximate cooling rate and\nan ambient pressure with TISM =8000K were adopted. In our simulations the\nambient pressure is not negligible and the outward moving front is not a shock,\nso the self-similarity seems to be broken.\n3\nFig. 3 shows the evolution of Rbs and swept-up shell mass, Mbs = (4\u03c0/3)Rbs\n\u03c10 ,\n35\nfor all the models in Table 1. For our models with Lw = Nstar (3.17\u00d710 ergs\u22121 )\nand nH,0 = 1 cm\u22123 , the radius and mass of wind-blown bubble shell can be\napproximated by\n\n0.18\nRbs \u2248 (22pc)Nstar\n(\n\nt\n106 yrs\n\n)0.4 ,\n\n(12)\n\nand\n0.54\nMbs \u2248 (1.6 \u00d7 103 M\u2299 )Nstar\n(\n\nt\n106 yrs\n9\n\n)1.2 .\n\n(13)\n\n\fThese relations are slightly different from what Weaver et al. (1977) derived\nthrough simplified numerical integrations described above.\nRight panels of Fig. 3 show how Rbs and Mbs depend on nH,0 or the metalicity\nZ. These quantities do not scale with the ambient density in a simple way,\nbecause the radiative energy loss depends not only on the gas density but\nalso on the detailed history of how heat is transported from the hot cavity to\nthe warm shell via thermal conduction. It seems that for nH,0 < 1 cm\u22123 the\n\u22121/3\nswept-up mass is nearly independent of the ISM density, while Rbs \u221d nH,0 . For\nhigh density medium (nH,0 \u226b 1 cm\u22123 ), the cooling time scale becomes much\nshorter than the dynamical time, and so the numerical simulation becomes\nincreasingly difficult. For WH01 model with nH,0 = 3 cm\u22123 , Mbs is about\n3 times that of WF01 models. However, this trend cannot be generalized\nto higher density cases because of nonlinear behavior of heat transport and\nradiative cooling. For WZ01 with lower metalicity (0.1 Z\u2299 ) the cooling is less\nefficient and so the results are similar to those of WL01 model with lower\nambient density.\nBottom panels of Fig. 3 show the fraction of energy lost due to radiative cooling. The radiation energy is calculated as the energy lost from the simulation\nvolume, Erad (t) = Lw * t + Etot,i \u2212 Etot (t), where Etot = Ek + Eth is the total\nenergy inside the simulation volume and Etot,i is its initial value. Here the\nthermal energy Eth excludes the initial thermal energy of the ambient gas.\nThe energy loss due to radiative cooling is significant: about 60 % for WL01\nand WLZ01 models and about 60-80 % for WH01 and WF01-WF50 models.\nFor WF models the fraction of Erad is reduced somewhat for higher Lw (larger\nNstar ), because higher power wind creates hotter cavities.\n\n4\n\nMultiple Supernova Explosion\n\n4.1 Multiple Supernova Models\nNext we calculate the evolution of multiple supernovae exploded inside the preexisting wind bubble created by the MS winds. So we take the final structures\nof the wind bubble simulations at t = 4 \u00d7 106 yrs, described in the previous\nsection, as the states of the circumstellar medium prior to SN explosions.\nEach SN explosion is characterized by the explosion energy, Eej = 1051 erg,\nand the ejecta mass, Mej = 10 M\u2299 . Then the ejecta can be approximated\nby a uniform density core (\u03c11 ) and an outer envelope with a steep power-law\ndensity profile (\u03c12 \u221d r \u2212n ), expanding freely with the radial velocity, v = r/t\n(Chevalier & Liang, 1989). For a multiple explosion where NSN supernovae\n10\n\n\fdetonate simultaneously, i.e., total explosion energy ESN = NSN Eej , the density profile of the ejecta is defined by\n\u03c11 = F t\u22123 for v \u2264 vt ,\n\u22123\n\n\u03c12 = F t\n\nv\nvt\n\n!\u2212n\n\n(14)\n\nfor v > vt ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere\nNSN [3(n \u2212 3)Mej ]5/2\n,\nF =\n4\u03c0n [10(n \u2212 5)Eej ]3/2\n\n(16)\n\nand\n\"\n\n10 (n \u2212 5) Eej\nvt =\n3 (n \u2212 3) Mej\n\n#1/2\n\n.\n\n(17)\n\nWe adopt n = 10, vt = 3.16\u00d7103 km s\u22121 and F = NSN *(8.14\u00d7107 g cm\u22123 s3 ).\nWe note that overall results of our calculations do not depend sensitively on\nthe specific values of Mej and Eej adopted. As shown below, the evolution of\na superbubble is controlled mainly by the total explosion energy ESN rather\nthan Eej . Also a SNR should lose its memory of ejecta mass after the swept-up\nmass becomes much greater than Mej .\nTable 2 shows the multiple SN explosion models considered here. The number\nof SNe is given by NSN 1 and varies from 1 to Nstar , since Nstar is the total\nnumber of possible SNe inside a given bubble. As in the wind bubble stage,\nwe consider three values of the ISM density: nH,0 = 1 cm\u22123 as a fiducial value\n(SNF models), 0.3 cm\u22123 (SNL01) and 3 cm\u22123 (SNH01). Since SN explosions\ncan occur sequentially with a time interval, we also consider SNF02a model in\nwhich a second SN detonates 105 years after the first SN. This will be compared\nwith SNF02b model in which two SNe explode simultaneously. Again SNZ01\nand SNZ10 models have a lower metalicity, 0.1 Z\u2299 .\nWe use the same grid setup as the wind simulations: i.e., Nr = 3000 uniform\ngrid zones in 150 pc radius. Again two additional simulations are carried out\nfor SNF01 model with smaller grid spacings (Nr = 6000 and 12000) to test\nnumerical convergence. Radial position of the outer shock is converged within\n0.5 %, while the total energy is converged within 5 %. The simulations are\nterminated at tf = 106 years.\n11\n\n\f4.2 Evolution of Supernovae Remnants\n\nFig. 4 shows the radial profile of the remnant for the single SN case (SNF01\nmodel). Initially, the SN profile described by Eqs. (14)-(17) is superimposed\nonto the final output of the corresponding wind bubble model (WF01): the\nwind termination shock is at 3 pc and the hot cavity extends out to 25 pc (solid\nlines in Fig. 4). The compression wave has weakened and the shell thickness is\nlarge (\u03b1 \u2248 0.43), so the density of swept up shell, nshell = 1.1 cm\u22123 , is slightly\nhigher than the ambient density (see Eq. [11]). The SN blast shock wave\npasses through the pressure barrier produced by the wind termination shock\nand travels quickly through the hot cavity. The forward shock first interacts\nwith the bubble shell at \u223c 104 years, pushing out the inner shell boundary and\ngenerating two secondary waves, i.e., a transmitted shock propagating outward\ninto the bubble shell and a weak reflected compression wave moving inward\ninto the ejecta. A reverse shock forms in the SN ejecta around 5 \u00d7 103 years\nand is reflected at the center around 7.5 \u00d7 103 years. Afterward it becomes a\ntraveling compression wave, because the shock heated gas inside the cavity is\nhot. When this wave runs into the shell at \u223c 105 years, the shell is heated for\nthe second time.\nBy the termination time (106 years) the shell is pushed out by the SNR to\nRss =67 pc with inner radius Rss,i =54 pc and the swept up shell gas has\nT = 104 K and nshell \u2248 4 cm\u22123 , not much higher than the ambient medium.\nOn the other hand, the cavity is filled with the hot gas of T \u2248 106 K and\nnH \u2248 0.01 cm\u22123 . The outer shock weakens with expansion and slows down to\n\u223c cs .\nFig. 5 compares the two different models of double explosions, i.e., sequential\n(SNF02a) and simultaneous (SNF02b) explosion models. In SNF02a model,\nthe second SN explosion is loaded 105 years after the first SN explosion. Three\nsnapshots are shown: 1) At 6.0 \u00d7 104 years the outer shock in SNF02b model\nhas expanded further out than the shock in SNF02a model. 2) At 1.2 \u00d7 105\nyears, a little after loading of the second SN in SNF02a model, the second SN\nshock expands out to 35 pc, still well inside the shell at 42-46 pc generated by\nthe first SN. 3) At 2.0 \u00d7 105 years the SN-driven shell has expanded slightly\nfurther out (\u223c50 pc) in SNF02b model than in SNF02a model. However, the\ndifference is small enough, so we say the bubble size is similar for the two\nmodels.\nThe left panels of Fig. 6 also show the comparison of the two double explosion models. The outer shock radius and shell mass of the two models are\nvery similar. Here Eth and Ek are total thermal and kinetic energy inside the\nsimulation volume, respectively, excluding the initial thermal energy of the\nambient gas. The time evolution of Eth and Ek shows that the initial kinetic\n12\n\n\fenergy of the SN ejecta is transferred to the thermal energy gradually in the\nbeginning as the blast wave expands, but rather abruptly at \u223c 104 years when\nthe blast wave runs into the preexisting wind-blown shell. The thermalization\nprocess happens again at later times in SNF02a model, when the second SN\ndetonates at 105 years and when its blast wave arrives at the first SN shell at\n\u223c 105.2 years. Interestingly, the latter event occurs at the similar time when\nthe aforementioned compression wave hits the shell in SNF02b model, causing\nthe second period of active radiative cooling.\nMost of thermal energy is lost through radiative cooling. Here the radiation\nenergy is calculated by Erad (t) = Etot,i \u2212 Etot (t). We note that the initial total\nenergy, Etot,i , includes both the SN energy and the energy of the preexisting\nwind bubble, so (Etot +Erad )/ESN is greater than one. At the termination time\nof our simulations, the final energy budget in the two models are similar: 6% in\nthermal energy, 7% in kinetic energy, and 90% lost through radiation energy.\nFigs. 5-6 imply that, for given total explosion energy, the different fashion of\nmultiple explosion, i.e., either sequential or simultaneous detonation, does not\nmake significant differences in the size and mass of the final bubble shell.\nThe right panels of Fig. 6 compare the models with different ambient density\nand different metalicity. At lower density or with lower metal abundance, the\nbubble size is bigger and Erad is smaller, compared to higher density models,\nbut the shell mass is similar for all the models considered here.\nSimultaneous explosions with 1, 3, 5, and 10 SNe inside a wind bubble generated by 10 massive stars are considered as SNF10a-d models. Initial conditions\nare taken from WF10 model simulation: the cavity is bounded by the CD at 56\npc and the outer compression wave is at 82 pc. The upper two panels of Fig. 7\nshow the bubble structure at 106 years for SNF10a-d models. More energetic\nexplosion pushes the shell further out and produces a faster shock, leading to\na larger and denser shell. The lower panels of Fig. 7 show the profiles of SNRs\nin a uniform ISM (nH,0 = 1 cm\u22123 ) for comparison. It shows that SN-driven\nbubbles are larger and hotter, if SNe explode inside a preexisting bubble. For\nexample, the size of hot bubble for SNF10a-d models is 33-55 % larger than\nthat for SNe inside a uniform ISM, resulting in 2.4 - 3.7 times bigger volume\nof hot gas. Also the cavity temperature is 2-3 times higher in SNF10a-d models. This implies that the volume filling factor and the temperature of the hot\nbubbles generated by core-collapse SNe would be underestimated by a factor\nof 2-4, if the preexisting bubble is not properly accounted for.\nThe left panels of Fig. 8 show the evolution of the bubble properties for\nSNF10a-d models, while the right panels compare the SNZ10a-d models with\nlower metalicity. The radial position of the outermost shock increases as Rss \u221d\nt0.6\u22120.8 before the arrival of the blast wave at the shell, and afterward it increases very slowly, Rss \u221d t0.1\u22120.15 . The size of SN-driven bubbles depends on\n13\n\n\fboth the SN explosion energy and the size of pre-existing wind bubbles. According to the numerical results shown in Fig. 8, Rss and Mss depends rather\n0.1\n0.3\nweakly on ESN , i.e., Rss \u2248 (85pc)NSN\nand Mss \u2248 (104.8 M\u2299 )NSN\n.\n\nAgain the evolution of Eth , Ek , and Erad indicates the complex thermalization\nhistory via shocks. The first major episode of radiative cooling occurs when\nthe SN blast wave first hits the wind bubble at t \u223c 104.5 years. When the\ncompression wave generated by the reverse shock runs into the shell at t \u223c 105.4\nyears, the shell is heated and compressed, leading to the second episode of\nrapid cooling. In SNF10d model this behavior is most distinct. For SNF10a-d\nmodels, about 80-90 % of ESN is lost via radiative cooling within 106 years,\nwhile only 10 % remains as thermal energy and <\n\u223c10 % as kinetic energy.\nFor SNZ10a-d models with lower metal abundance the radiative cooling is less\nefficient compared to SNF10a-d models, so about 70 % is lost, 20-40 % remains\nas thermal energy and 10 % as kinetic energy. Since the shell has a significant\nkinetic energy at that time, it would continue to expand slowly. Exploration of\nlater evolutionary stage requires more realistic treatments of radiative transfer,\nphotoionization/heating, and non-equilibrium radiative cooling below 104 K,\nwhich is beyond the scope of this study.\n\nIn the self-enrichment model of globular cluster formation, the shell of gas\nswept up by the blast wave from multiple SNe must cool and be confined\ngravitationally within the parent proto-globular cloud in order for the enrichment process to be effective (Morgan & Lake, 1989; Parmetier et al., 1999;\nParmentier, 2004). Thus the success of this model lies on how efficiently the SN\nexplosion energy is radiated away to form gravitationally bound system. According to Fig. 8 (SNZ10 models), in an average ISM with nH,0 = 1 cm\u22123 and\nPISM = 2.3 \u00d7 10\u221212 erg cm\u22123 , massive stars in an association with Nstar \u2248 50\nwould generate a bubble shell with Rss \u2248 120 pc and Mss \u2248 105.5 M\u2299 . Incidentally this mass is similar to the characteristic mass of globular clusters.\nIf 10 % of explosion energy is left as the kinetic energy of the shell, then\nEk \u2248 5 \u00d7 1051 ergs. With the gas temperature of T = 104 K, the total thermal energy of the photoionized shell is Eth \u2248 1051 ergs. But the gravitational\n2\nenergy, |EG | \u223c GMss\n/Rss \u2248 1050 ergs, is too small to confine the shell gravitationally. Thus the self-enrichment model would not work inside such low density clouds, but may operate in much higher density environment. If we blindly\n\u22121/3\ntake the simple scaling relations shown in Figs. 6 and 8, i.e., Rss \u221d nH,0 , but\nMss \u2248 constant, then the gravitational energy of the shell would increase\n1/3\nwith the ambient density as |EG | \u221d nH,0 . In a much denser cloud higher ambient pressure would also help the shell to be confined, possibly resulting in a\ngravitationally bound system.\n14\n\n\f4.3 Diffuse Radiation Emitted by Supernova Driven Bubbles\n\nAs shown in the previous section, most of mechanical SN energy is transformed\ninto thermal energy of the bubble shell and then lost via diffuse radiation. So\nradiative feedback is a significant part of SN feedback into the surrounding\nISM. In order to study the photoionization/heating feedback of SN explosions\nwe calculate the diffuse radiation emitted by the bubble.\nFirst, we generate both continuum and line emissivities, f\u03bd = 4\u03c0j\u03bd (T )/n2H\n(ergs cm3 s\u22121 eV\u22121 ) and fline = 4\u03c0jline (T )/n2H (ergs cm3 s\u22121 ), for nH = 1 cm\u22123\nas a function of gas temperature for photon energy Eph (eV) = h\u03bd = [Emin , Emax ] =\n[1.36\u00d710\u22124 , 108 ], using CLOUDY90 code (Ferland et al. 1998). Collisional ionization equilibrium is assumed and no background radiation field is adopted.\nThe emissivity tables are generated for two values of metalicity, Z\u2299 and\n0.1 Z\u2299 . Volume integrated spectrum of the diffuse radiation emitted by the\nbubble during the integration time t is calculated by\n\nF\u03bd (t) =\n\nZt\n\ndt\n\n0\n\nRZss (t)\n\n4\u03c0r\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\"\n\n#\n\nfline\nf\u03bd (T ) +\nn2 (T, r)dr,\n\u2206Eph H\n\n(18)\n\nwhere F\u03bd is given in units of ergs eV\u22121 and line emissivities divided by the\nwidth of a given photon energy bin are added to the corresponding continuum\nR\nR\nemissivity. In practice, only V (T, t) \u2261 4\u03c0 dt n2H (T )r 2 dr is calculated during\nsimulations and then F\u03bd (t) = V (T, t) * [f\u03bd (T ) + fline /\u2206Eph ] is calculated in a\npost-processing step.\nThe upper panel of Fig. 9 shows the evolution of F\u03bd (t) for a single SN model.\nMost of hard X-ray photons with Eph > 1 keV are emitted early before the\nblast wave runs into the wind bubble shell (t < 8 \u00d7 103 years). Afterward,\nthe fluxes of lower energy photons increase with time, as the SN energy is\ndeposited as heat into the bubble shell and radiated away mainly in UV and\noptical ranges. The lower panel of Fig. 9 compares F\u03bd for SNF01 and SNZ01\nmodels integrated to the final simulation time. In SNZ01 model metal lines are\nweaker, but H and He recombination continuum radiation is stronger, because\nthe temperature is higher due to lower cooling rate.\nWe also calculate the integrated energies and photon numbers of diffuse radiation that can ionize hydrogen and helium atoms as follows:\n\n\u03b5Ei =\n\nEZmax\n\ndEph F\u03bd (tf ),\n\n(19)\n\nEi\n\n15\n\n\f\u03a6Ei =\n\nEZmax\nEi\n\ndEph\n\nF\u03bd (tf )\n,\nEph\n\n(20)\n\nwhere Ei = 13.6, 24.6, and 54.4 eV is the ionization energy for H, He, and\nHe+ , respectively. These quantities are summarized in Table 3. For SNF01\nmodel, the total number of H ionizing photons is \u03a613.6 \u2248 1061 and the total\nenergy carried away with those photons is \u03b513.6 \u2248 0.55ESN . The total number\nof H ionizing photons scales roughly with the SN explosion energy as \u03a613.6 \u223c\n1061 NSN .\nDiffuse radiation is enhanced overall in the models where a denser and hotter\nshell is produced. Comparing the results of SNL01, SNF01 and SNH01 models\nin Table 3, we can see that more diffuse photons are produced at denser\nenvironments. A SN with higher explosion energy generates a faster blast\nwave and produces a denser and hotter shell, emitting harder diffuse radiation.\nThe results of SNF10a-d models show such trends. On the other hand, the\ncomparison of SNF02a and SNF02b models indicate that the simultaneous\ndouble explosion generates more ionizing photons than the sequential double\nexplosion, although the total radiation energy (Erad ) is similar in the two\nmodels. SNZ models with lower metalicity produce less ionizing radiation and\nmore non-ionizing radiation, compared to the models with solar metalicity.\nFig. 10 shows the evolution of \u03b5Ei for SNF10a-d and SNZ10a-d models. Most\nof ionizing photons are emitted during 104.5 \u2212 105 years when the SN shock\npropagates into the bubble shell. For models with NSN = 10 ionizing photons\nare emitted actively again when the reflected compression wave runs into the\nshell around 105.3 years (see also Fig. 8).\n\n5\n\nSummary\n\nWe study multiple supernova (SN) explosions inside a preexisting cavity blown\nup by stellar winds from massive progenitor stars through numerical hydrodynamic simulations. Calculations are performed with a grid-based Eulerian\ncode in one dimensional spherical symmetry, including radiative cooling and\nthermal conduction. Heat transport by thermal conduction is important inside the hot cavity, while radiative cooling is dominant in the bubble shell.\nWe consider models with a wide range of physical parameters: the ambient\ndensity, 0.3 \u2264 nH,0 \u2264 3 cm\u22123 , the metalicity, Z\u2299 and 0.1 Z\u2299 , the number of\nmassive stars, Nstar = 1 \u2212 50, and the number of supernovae, NSN = 1 \u2212 10.\nIn order to study the radiative feedback effects, we also calculate the ionizing\ndiffuse radiation emitted by the SN-driven bubble.\n16\n\n\fWe first calculate the development of a bubble driven by collective winds from\nNstar massive stars with Lw = Nstar * (3.17 \u00d7 1035 ergs\u22121 ). Characteristic structures of wind bubbles are developed initially: an inward facing termination\nshock, a conduction front near the contact discontinuity, and a forward expanding shock. The outermost shock is not strong and becomes a compression\nwave, because the wind ram pressure decreases as the bubble expands. At the\nend of the main sequence (\u223c 4 \u00d7 106 years), the outer boundary of the bubble\n0.18\nshell (i.e., radius of the compression wave) is Rbs \u2248 (60pc)Nstar\n, and the inner\n\u22123\nboundary is Rbs,i \u2248 (0.7 \u2212 0.9)Rbs for nH,0 = 1 cm . So the shell is rather\nthick and the enhancement factor of the shell density is small, i.e., nshell /nH,0 =\n0.54\n1.5 \u2212 3.7. The mass of the bubble shell is Mbs \u2248 (2 \u00d7 104 M\u2299 )Nstar\n.\nThe evolution of a supernova remnant inside a wind bubble is much more\ncomplex than that in a uniform medium. It depends on the structure and size\nof the preexisting bubble as well as the total explosion energy, ESN = NSN *1051\nergs. The forward shock travels quickly through the cavity and runs into the\nbubble shell, resulting in a transmitted forward shock. On the other hand, the\nreverse shock in the ejecta is reflected at the center and becomes a compression\nwave that travels outward. When this wave runs into the shell, the shell is\nheated for the second time, followed by the second period of active radiative\ncooling. The wave bounces off the shell and moves inward with a much reduced\namplitude.\nAt the termination time of the simulations (tf = 106 years), the outer shock\nradius is Rss \u2248 67 pc for a single SN inside a bubble blown by one massive\nstar (SNF01 model), while Rss \u2248 85 pc for a single SN inside a bubble blown\nby 10 massive stars (SNF10a model). In comparison, the shock radius for a\nsingle SN in a uniform ISM of the same density at the same time is about\n60 pc. The radii of the hot cavity and the bubble shell can be bigger up to\n50 % and the cavity temperature is higher by 2-3 times for SN explosions\nin a wind bubble considered here, compared to the SN explosions inside a\nuniform ISM. For multiple SN explosions inside a bubble blown by 10 massive\nstars, the size and mass of the shell increase rather weakly with the total\n0.1\n0.3\nexplosion energy as Rss \u2248 (85pc)NSN\nand a mass of Mss \u2248 (104.8 M\u2299 )NSN\n.\nFor NSN = 50, for example, the SN-driven shell would have typically Rss \u223c 125\npc and Mss \u223c 105.3 M\u2299 for the average ISM.\nKinetic energy of the SN is transfered to thermal energy via various shocks.\nAbout 20-60 % of the explosion energy is radiated away after the SN shock\nhits the wind bubble shell, and then 20-40 % is lost after the compression\nwave crushes into the shell later. Although the final energy budget at the\ntermination time of our simulations depends on both the wind bubble structure\nand ESN , in most cases with solar metalicity, Erad /ESN \u2248 0.8\u22120.9, Eth /ESN \u223c\n0.1 and Ek /ESN <\n\u223c 0.1. Ionizing photons of diffuse radiation account for up\nto \u03b513.6 /ESN \u223c 0.55, while the total number of ionizing photons scales as\n17\n\n\f\u03a613.6 \u223c 1061 NSN . For the cases with 0.1 Z\u2299 , the radiative loss is reduced a little\nbit, i.e., Erad /ESN \u223c 0.7, but the fraction of ionizing radiation is reduced a\nfactor of 2-3, compared to the models with solar metalicity. So a larger fraction\nof energy is lost via non-ionizing radiation at metal-poor environments.\nWe suggest physically correct prescriptions for SN feedback in numerical simulations of galaxy formation should reflect the natures described in this study.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors would like to thank J.
