When direct\ncomputation fails, one resorts to studying asymptotics in various limits. In practice, a few first terms in the expansion\nmay already suffice to reach the desired precision. However, expansion of a multi-loop integral may become nontrivial due to an interplay of parameters with the integration variables (components of loop momenta). Classification\nof relevant sectors in the integration space is itself a challenging problem [1, 2].\nOne important case is the asymptotic expansion in momenta and masses in the limits typical for the Euclidean\nspace. This problem has been completely solved in terms of sums over subgraphs [3\u20137]. At least one automated\ntool [8, 9] implements this approach in practice. For a more general situation, including the limits appearing in the\nMinkowski space, there exists the universal strategy of expansion by regions in the momentum space [1, 2, 10]. In\nall known cases, it produces correct results, but a rigorous proof is still lacking. Typically, one manually analyzes a\nmulti-scale problem, starting from simpler examples that can be checked against known analytical results or numerical\nestimates, computed e.g. with FIESTA [11] (later versions [12] of FIESTA may also evaluate a few first terms in a\ngiven asymptotic expansion.)\nAn important type of non-Euclidean expansions, the so-called threshold expansion [1], requires the most careful\ntreatment. Cancellation of dominant terms becomes obvious only in a specially chosen frame or with a certain routing\nof loop momenta. In what follows we try to elaborate some approach to non-threshold asymptotic expansion, based\non alpha-representation of integrals, and describe a simple practical algorithm.\nII.\n\nEXPANSION BY REGIONS AND ALPHA-REPRESENTATION\n\nA thorough introduction to the expansion by regions and alpha-representation can be found elsewhere [10, 13].\nHere we briefly introduce the basic notation with a trivial example.\nConsider a family of one-loop propagator-type integrals in the Euclidean space:\nZ\n1\ndD k\n2\n2\n, D1 = k 2 + m2 , D2 = (k + p)2 + m2 .\n(1)\nI1 (a1 , a2 ; p , m ) =\n(2\u03c0)D D1a1 D2a2\nA specific integral is determined by the exponents a1 and a2 and depends on the two parameters, m2 and p2 . The\nstructure of the expansion does not depend on a1 and a2 and we will not mention those exponents in the following\ndiscussion.\nWe consider the asymptotics of I1 (a1 , a2 ; p2 , m2 ) in the limit when |p2 | \u226b m2 , or \u03c1 = |m2 /p2 | \u226a 1. The naive\nTaylor expansion does not capture the complete asymptotic behaviour since the integrationpvariables (components of\nk) span all values from \u2212\u221e to +\u221e, and in particular can be as small as m or as large as |p2 |.\nThe prescription in this case is to find regions, or scalings of momentum components that after the expansion\nprovide non-zero contributions. In each region, we first Taylor expand the integrand and drop the scaling restrictions.\nIn our example, there are three non-zero regions, summarized in Tab. I. For example, in the region (c) one expands\nD2 as follows:\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\n1\n1\na2 (k 2 + 2kp + m2 )\ndD k\n2\n2\n+ . . . + other regions\n(2)\n\u2212\nI1 (a1 , a2 ; p , m ) =\nD\n2\n2 a1 (p2 )a2\n(p2 )a2 +1\nk\u03bc \u223cm (2\u03c0) (k + m )\n\u0014Z\n\u0015\nZ\ndD k\ndD k\n1\n(...)\n=\n+ . . . + other regions.\n+\n(2\u03c0)D (k 2 + m2 )a1 (p2 )a2\n(2\u03c0)D (k 2 + m2 )a1 (p2 )a2 +1\nIn the last line, we dropped the restriction on k and the problem reduced to evaluation of (multiple) Feynman\nintegrals with simpler denominator factors, various denominator exponents and possibly more complex numerators.\n\n\f2\n\np\n\np\n\nk\n\nk\n\n(a)\n\nD1 = k2 + m2 ,\nD2 = (k + p)2 + m2 ,\n\u03c1 = |m2 /p2 | \u226a 1\n\nU = x1 + x2 ,\nF = x1 x2 (p2 + 2m2 ) + x21 m2 + x22 m2\n\n|k2 | \u223c |p2 | \u226b m2 ,\n\nx1 , x2 \u223c \u03c1A ,\n\n(b)\n(b)\n\nD1\n\np\n\nk\n\n(c)\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nx2 \u223c \u03c1A , x1 \u223c \u03c1A\u22121 ,\n(c)\n\n= k2 + m2 , D2 = p2\n\nU (c) = x1 , F (c) = x1 x2 p2 + x21 m2\n\n|(k + p)2 | \u223c m2 ,\n(d)\n\nk+p\n\nU (b) = x1 + x2 , F (b) = x1 x2\n\n|k2 | \u223c m2 ,\nD1\n\np\n\n(b)\n\n= k2 , D2 = (k + p)2\n\nD1\n\n(d)\n\n= p2 , D2\n\nx2 \u223c \u03c1A\u22121 , x1 \u223c \u03c1A\n\n= (k + p)2 + m2\n\nU (d) = x2 , F (d) = x1 x2 p2 + x22 m2\n\nTABLE I: Regions (b-d) of expansion of a double-scale integral (a) in the momentum space and in the alpha-representation.\n\nThe non-trivial statement is that the double-counting which could have been introduced disappears in the sum of\nall regions. For the purpose of the following discussion we assume that the tensor reduction of numerators and the\nproliferation of terms can be managed; we will focus on the transformations of denominator factors in every region\n(e.g. (k + p)2 + m2 \u2192 p2 in the example above).\nSome types of asymptotic expansion may require more elaborate choice of regions. For example, k0 may scale\ndifferently from ki or some combination of components may have a separate scale (this happens, e.g., in Sudakov\nlimits). It is thus desirable to have an explicitly covariant formalism to identify regions, independent of the frame\nchoice and the routing of momenta. For that purpose, we may switch to the alpha-representation of integrals. We\nre-write an integral with n lines (denominator factors) over D-dimensional loop momenta as an integral over n positive\nparameters x1 , .., xn . Information about the graph is then encoded in the two homogeneous polynomials, U and F .\nFor example, our integral above is\nZ\n\u0393(a1 + a2 \u2212 D/2) \u221e\ndx1 dx2 \u03b4(1 \u2212 x1 \u2212 x2 )xa1 1 \u22121 xa2 2 \u22121 U a1 +a2 \u2212D F D/2\u2212a1 \u2212a2 ,\n(3)\nI1 (a1 , a2 ; p2 , m2 ) =\n\u0393(a1 )\u0393(a2 )\n0\nU = x1 + x2 , F = x1 x2 (p2 + 2m2 ) + x21 m2 + x22 m2 .\nThe expansion by regions may also be formulated in the alpha-representation [2, 10]. Instead of finding the scaling\nbehaviour of loop momentum components, here we deal with the scaling of each parameter xi that directly corresponds\nto the scale of the i-th line (denominator factor) of the original integral. During the expansion, only the leading terms\nremain in the polynomials U and F , and the resulting alpha-representation represents the integrals obtained by the\nexpansion in the momentum space. The last column of Tab. I demonstrates the scaling of alpha-parameters and the\npolynomials corresponding to each region.\nNote that in the language of alpha-parameters, the difference between the threshold-type and non-threshold ex2\npansion becomes clear. Let us consider integral of Eq. 1 in the threshold limit y = m2 + p4 \u226a m2 (that, of course,\nimplies that p2 < 0, i.e. this limit is essentially non-Euclidean). Choosing the frame where p = (p0 , ~0) and re-routing\nthe loop momentum, we obtain the denominator factors D1 = k02 + ~k 2 + k0 p0 + y and D2 = k02 + ~k 2 \u2212 k0 p0 + y.\nThis integral has two non-vanishing regions. The first \"hard\" region is characterized by k \u223c m. The second\n\u221a\n\"potential\" region corresponds to k0 \u223c y/m, |~k| \u223c y. In the language of alpha-parameters, in the \"hard\" region\n2\n\nonly the second term survives in the polynomial F = y(x1 + x2 )2 \u2212 p4 (x1 \u2212 x2 )2 . The most troublesome \"potential\"\nregion stems from a thin layer in the integration space near the surface x1 = x2 , when the second term has the same\nscaling as the first.\nIn a similar way, more complex threshold expansions receive contributions which depend on cancellations between\nthe terms in the expanded F which happens along some non-trivial surface and not at zero or infinity. Presently we\n\n\f3\ndo not know a general rule to identify such surfaces and find substitutions revealing such regions. Instead, we focus\non the \"usual\" regions that can be determined by examining independently the monomials in U and F . However\nlimited, this problem is still important for many applications.\nIII.\n\nGENERAL FORMALISM\n\nWe consider an l-loop Feynman integral\nI(a1 , ..., an ) =\n\nZ\n\ndD k1 ...dD kl\n,\n(2\u03c0)lD D1a1 ...Dnan\n\n(4)\n\nwhich depends on n exponents a1 , ..., an , scalar products of e external momenta p1 , ..., pe and parameters (such as\nmasses) in denominator factors Di . The latter must be quadratic in momenta but other than that may have any\nform, e.g. correspond to a massive, such as \u2212(ki + pj )2 + m2k \u2212 i0, or a static propagator, such as (\u22122ki pj \u00b1 i0). The\nalpha-representation for this integral has a general structure\nZ 1\nI(a1 , ..., an ) = c\ndx1 ...dxn \u03b4(1 \u2212 x1 \u2212 ... \u2212 xn )xa1 1 \u22121 ...xnan \u22121 U a F b ,\n(5)\n0\n\nwhere coefficient c and exponents a and b depend only on l, D, and ai . U and F are homogeneous polynomials (of\norder l and l + 1, respectively) of integration variables xi , and F also depends on the kinematic invariants. If the\ndenominators Di correspond to some graph and have a standard form \u2212k 2 + m2 \u2212 i0 (in Minkowski space), then the\nfunctions U and F can be read off the graph in terms of trees and 2-trees [13]. In a more general case, one may obtain\nU and F with a tool found at http://www-ttp.particle.uni-karlsruhe.de/~asmirnov/Tools-UF.htm. In what\nfollows, we will only discuss the properties of U and F that are independent of specific indices ai .\nIn dimensional regularization, \"scaleless\" integrals (having no inherent scale) turn to zero. More specifically, an\nintegral is scaleless if it is possible to re-scale some loop momenta or their components so that the result remains\nproportional to the original integral, or Di ({kj }, {aki }) = aui Di ({k}), with some subset {ki } of integration momenta.\nIn particular, massless vacuum bubbles vanish:\nZ\nZ\ndD k\ndD (\u03b1k)\nI=\n=\n= \u03b1D\u22122n I = 0.\n(6)\n(k 2 )n\n((\u03b1k)2 )n\nIn terms of the alpha-representation Eq. 5, a similar statement applies to homogeneity of U and F with respect\nto a subset {B} of integration variables xi ({B} should not coincide with the full set of {xi }). Integrals vanish if\nU({xj }, {axi }) = au U({x}) and F ({xj }, {axi }) = af F ({x}), i \u2208 {B}, with some scaling dimensions u and f .\nIn order to avoid separate treatment of U and F , one may consider the product UF that incorporates the scaling\nand asymptotic properties of both factors (but may contain many terms).\nIV.\n\nGEOMETRIC INTERPRETATION OF ASYMPTOTIC EXPANSION\n\nLet us start with some integral in the alpha-representation Eq. 5 with integration variables x1 , ..., xn and a small\nexpansion parameter \u03c1. Each of M terms in F corresponds to a vector of n + 1 exponents (we here neglect common\nfactors and numeric coefficients, irrelevant to the non-threshold expansion):\n\u03c1r0 xr11 ...xrnn \u2192 (r0 , r1 , ..., rn ),\n\n(7)\n\nand F corresponds to a set {F } of M points in (n + 1)-dimensional vector space. Due to homogeneity of F , all these\npoints belong to an n-dimensional hyperplane r1 + ... + rn = l + 1, parallel to the 0-th axis (the axis of r0 ).\nTerms of U have no explicit powers of \u03c1 in the coefficients. The corresponding set {U } is thus confined to an\n(n \u2212 2)-dimensional hyperplane r0 = 0, r1 + ... + rn = l. In Fig. 1 we present such points corresponding to the example\nin Eq. 1, where the three terms of {F } are denoted with crossed points and the two terms of {U } with diamonds.\nIf we fix the scales of alpha-parameters as xi \u223c \u03c1vi , then the scale of a monomial is \u03c1r0 xr11 ...xrnn \u223c \u03c1r0 +v1 r1 +...+rnvn \u223c\n\u03c1~r~v with ~r = (r0 , ..., rn ) from {F } and ~v = (1, v1 , ..., vn ). Graphically, ~r~v represents the length of a projection of the\nvector ~r on the direction ~v .\nSome special choices of directions ~v determine the regions of expansion that we seek. The terms in F that remain\nafter the expansion are all characterized by the same scale in powers of \u03c1. All points of the corresponding subset {F \u2032 }\nthen feature the same value of the projection on ~v , i.e. these points belong to the hyperplane orthogonal to ~v .\n\n\f4\n\nr0\n\nB (2,0,1)\n\nA (0,2,1)\nO\nD (0,1,0)\nr2\n\nE (1,0,0)\n\nr1\n\nB'\nC (1,1,0)\n\nA'\nFIG. 1: Graphical representation of sets {F } (crossed points) and {U } (diamonds) corresponding to the integral of Eq. 1.\n\nThe points corresponding to the neglected terms will be located \"above\" this hyperplane (since ~v always points\n\"up\" with respect to the 0-th axis). In other words, {F \u2032 } belong to a facet of the envelope, or the \"convex hull\" of\nthe set {F }, while the corresponding ~v is the normal vector to that facet. In a similar manner we may define a subset\n{U \u2032 } of the remaining terms in U.\nRelating the three expansion regions of Tab. I to graphics in Fig. 1, we find the corresponding points and vectors\n(points as denoted in the figure):\n\u2022 (b): ~v = (1, 0, 0), {F \u2032 } = (C), {U \u2032 } = (D, E),\n\u2022 (c): ~v = (1, 1, \u22121), {F \u2032 } = (A, C), {U \u2032 } = (D),\n\u2022 (d): ~v = (1, \u22121, 1), {F \u2032 } = (B, C), {U \u2032 } = (E).\nHere we exploit the freedom to re-scale all xi by the same power of \u03c1, i.e. shift ~v by any vector ~a = (0, A, ..., A). If\n~v corresponds to a region, then v~\u2032 = ~v + ~a determines the same region. For example, v~\u2032 = (1, 2, 0) also corresponds to\nthe region (c) above. It is convenient to choose ~v parallel to the plane where points {F } are confined, i.e. orthogonal\nto the vector (0, 1, ..., 1).\nNormally, only a few scaling choices produce non-zero regions. In our example, the choice x1 \u223c \u03c12 , x2 \u223c \u03c10 , leading\nto U = x2 , F = x22 m2 , or {F \u2032 } = (A), {U \u2032 } = (D), corresponds to a scaleless integral. As discussed above, this\nimplies an existence of a scaling leaving both U and F invariant up to a pre-factor (in this case, x1 \u2192 ax1 ).\nThe requirement that a region does not vanish can be easily formulated in the geometrical language. Consider the\npolynomial UF and the corresponding set of points {U F }. After the expansion with the chosen scalings, we are left\nwith its subset {U F \u2032 }. Numeric coefficients and kinematic invariants are irrelevant to the scalefulness of the region,\nand we get rid of them by projecting {U F \u2032 } on the plane r0 = 0. The thus obtained set of points {U F0\u2032 } belongs to\nthe (n \u2212 1)-dimensional hyperplane.\nScalelessness implies that all terms of the polynomial UF \u2032 are homogeneous with respect to a certain re-scaling. We\nthus deduce that the points of {U F0\u2032 } must then belong to an orthogonal space of the corresponding re-scaling vector\n~vh . In other words, {U F0\u2032 } is confined to at most (n \u2212 2)-dimensional subspace, and its (n \u2212 1)-dimensional volume is\nzero. The latter property can be easily checked (and used to check whether a given integral vanishes). However, it is\neasy to see that the \"bottom\" facets of the convex hull for {U F } automatically correspond to scaleful regions: their\ndimension is (n \u2212 1) by construction (otherwise they become \"ridges\" or \"vertices\"), and they (by selection) are not\northogonal to the plane r0 = 0 (thus the projection has non-zero volume).\nFinally, we may formulate the general procedure to determine the expansion regions. We start by building the\nset of points {U F }. Next, we find the n-dimensional convex hull C of the set {U F } in the n-dimensional plane\nr1 + ... + rn = l + 1, using any preferred algorithm. The implementation that we chose, QHull [14], does not allow\nbuilding hulls of dimensionality lower than the dimension of vector space. Thus, one has to introduce local coordinate\nsystem and deal with non-integer coordinate values. However, it is also possible to project {U F } along any of axes\nri , i 6= 0, e.g. consider (n \u2212 1)-dimensional points ~rk = (r0 , r1 , ..., rn\u22121 ). Convex hull C \u2032 built for this projection will\nbe the projection of the \"true\" convex hull C. Its dimensions will be stretched but the correspondence of the points\nto the facets and the vertices will persist.\n\n\f5\n\np1\nk1\n\nk2\np2\n\nFIG. 2: Double-scale two-loop vertex integral.\n\nFrom the (n \u2212 1)-dimensional facets of C we then select the \"bottom\", i.e. facets with normal vectors ~v pointing\n\"up\", with v0 > 0. For each of those \"bottom\" facets, we choose the normal vector ~v such that v0 = 1. Its components\n1 to n represent the relative scales of alpha-parameters xi and thus uniquely determine an expansion region.\nV.\n\nLESS TRIVIAL EXAMPLE\n\nLet us consider the integral in Fig. 2, this time defined in the Minkowski space (this example was first considered\nin [2] and [10], Chapter 10):\nZ\ndD k1 dD k2\nI2 (a1 , ..., a6 ; s, m2 , M 2 ) =\n,\n(8)\n(2\u03c0)2D D1a1 ...D6a6\nD1 = (p1 \u2212 k1 \u2212 k2 )2 \u2212 M 2 , D2 = (p1 \u2212 k2 )2 \u2212 M 2 , D3 = (p2 + k1 + k2 )2 \u2212 m2 ,\nD4 = (p2 + k2 )2 \u2212 m2 , D5 = k12 , D6 = k22 ,\np21 = M 2 , p22 = m2 , (p1 + p2 )2 = s, s, M 2 \u226b m2 .\nWith S = m2 + M 2 \u2212 s = \u22122p1 p2 , its alpha-representation reads:\nU = x1 x2 + x3 x2 + x5 x2 + x1 x4 + x3 x4 + x1 x5 + x3 x5 + x4 x5 + x1 x6 + x3 x6 + x5 x6 ,\nF = M 2 x21 x2 + M 2 x21 x4 + M 2 x21 x5 + M 2 x1 x22 + M 2 x22 x3 + M 2 x22 x5 + M 2 x21 x6 + 2M 2 x1 x2 x5\n+ m2 x2 x23 + m2 x23 x4 + m2 x1 x24 + m2 x3 x24 + m2 x23 x5 + m2 x24 x5 + m2 x23 x6 + 2m2 x3 x4 x5\n+ Sx1 x2 x3 + Sx1 x2 x4 + Sx1 x3 x4 + Sx1 x3 x5 + Sx1 x4 x5 + Sx1 x3 x6 + Sx2 x3 x4 + Sx2 x3 x5 + Sx2 x4 x5 .\n\n(9)\n\nFor simplicity, let us analyze F instead of the product UF . Choosing m as the small parameter and preserving the\norder of terms, in the 7-dimensional space we have 25 points: {F } = (0,2,1,0,0,0,0), (0,2,0,0,1,0,0), (0,2,0,0,0,1,0), . . . .\nThe projection of {F } along the 6-th axis (i.e. {F }p = (0,2,1,0,0,0), (0,2,0,0,1,0), . . . ) has a six-dimensional\nconvex hull with 18 facets. Of them, four belong to the \"bottom\". Restoring the 7-dimensional normal vectors with\nunit 0-th component, we find: ~v1 = (1, 0, \u22122, \u22122, \u22122, \u22122, \u22124), ~v2 = (1, 0, 0, \u22122, \u22122, \u22122, \u22122), ~v3 = (1, 0, 0, \u22122, 0, 0, 0),\n~v4 = (1, 0, 0, 0, \u22122, 0, \u22122). Since U is scaleful, we also have to add the \"hard\" region: ~v0 = (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0). (The\nlatter would appear automatically, had we used the product UF .)\nFor illustration, let us consider the most non-trivial \"ultrasoft-collinear\" region corresponding to ~v1 , or the scaling\nof alpha-parameters x1 \u223c m0 , x2 \u223c 1/m2 , x3 \u223c 1/m2 , x4 \u223c 1/m2 , x5 \u223c 1/m2 , and x6 \u223c 1/m4 . First, we may check\nthat ~v1 is indeed orthogonal to the plane containing the points 5, 6, 15, 22, 23, 24, and 25 from {F } (in the order as\nin Eq. 9). Those points correspond to the terms remaining in F \u2032 after the expansion: M 2 x22 x3 + M 2 x22 x5 + . . ..\n~\nIn the momentum\n\u0010 2 \u0011 space, the interpretation becomes clear only in the special reference frame, where p1 = (M, 0, 0),\nm\n~\np2 = M n+ +\nn\u2212 , and n\u00b1 = (1/2, 0, \u22131/2). We also decompose the first loop momentum in plus- and minusM\n\nparts, k1 = (k+ + k\u2212 , ~k, k+ \u2212 k\u2212 ). To reproduce the \"ultrasoft-collinear\" region, we should prescribe the following\nscales to the components of loop momenta: k+ \u223c m2 /M , k\u2212 \u223c M , ~k \u223c m, k2 \u223c m2 /M .\nAfter the expansion, the denominator factors scale as: D1 \u223c M 2 , D2 , D3 , D4 , D5 \u223c m2 , D6 \u223c m4 /M 2 . One can\neasily see how the powers of m here correspond to the components of \u2212~v1 .\nVI.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION\n\nWe wrote a Mathematica program that determines the expansion regions of a given Feynman integral based on the\nprocedure described above. The general problem of building a convex hull of M points in n dimensions is well-known\n\n\f6\n\u0001\nin computational geometry; we employ the algorithm quickhull [14] that has complexity O M \u230ad/2\u230b . It is sufficient\nwhen the number of lines is not too large; for example, finding 11 expansion regions of a 4-loop integral with 10 lines\ntakes about 10 seconds on a laptop PC.\nThe program has been checked against some non-trivial examples discussed in [10] and [15]. The code can be\ndownloaded from http://www-ttp.particle.uni-karlsruhe.de/~asmirnov/Tools-Regions.htm\nIn order to run the program, one has to install the open-source package QHull [14]. If the executable is not in the\ncurrent directory, Options[QHull] must be updated in the file asy.m. The program is loaded with command <<asy.m.\nThe main function is AlphaRepExpand[ks,ds,cs,hi], where ks is the list of loop momenta (e.g., {v1,v2}), ds are\nthe denominators (e.g., {(p1-v1-v2)^2-M^2,(p1-v2)^2-M^2,(p2+v1+v2)^2-m^2,(p2+v2)^2-m^2,v1^2,v2^2}), cs\ncontains the kinematic constraints (e.g., {p1^2->M^2,p2^2->m^2,p1*p2->-S/2}), and hi represents the scalings of\nkinematic invariants with respect to the small parameter x (e.g., {M->x^0,S->x^0,m->x^1}).\nThe output is a list of vectors specifying the scales of the alpha-parameters factors,\nor the non-zero components of vectors ~vi .\nFor the last example above, the output is\n{{0,-2,-2,-2,-2,-4},{0,0,-2,-2,-2,-2},{0,0,-2,0,0,0},{0,0,0,-2,0,2},{0,0,0,0,0,0}},\ncorresponding to the regions (us-1c), (1c-h), (h-1c), (1c-1c), and (h-h). These regions can be understood by analogy to the\nexample of Section V.\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe present an algorithm to find the relevant regions of expansion for a Feynman integral in a given limit of momenta\nand masses. The algorithm is implemented in Wolfram Mathematica language and uses open-source package QHull.\nThe program and examples can be downloaded from our web-page. In the future, we plan to extend the code in order\nto apply it to more general parametric integrals.\nAcknowledgements.
