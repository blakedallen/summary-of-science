The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are also obtained in both\ncases.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe AdS/CFT correspondence [1, 2, 3, 4] relates gravity in an anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime to a strongly coupled conformal field theory (CFT) living on the boundary of the AdS\nspace. Recently the AdS/CFT correspondence has been applied to various fields. By use\nof the AdS/CFT correspondence, one can calculate many quantities of strongly coupled\nCFTs through dual gravity theories. A remarkable example is the calculation of the ratio\nof shear viscosity to entropy density \u03b7/s of some field theories dual to the AdS Einstein\ngravity [5, 6, 7, 8]. In Einstein gravity, it was found that the ratio is a universal value\n\u2217\n\nE-mail: cairg@itp.ac.cn\nE-mail: liliphy@itp.ac.cn\n\u2021\nE-mail: zhangyl@itp.ac.cn\n\u2020\n\n1\n\n\f1/4\u03c0, while in the case with R2 corrections [9, 10, 11, 12] there is a negative additional\ncorrection term. Furthermore, it was shown that \u03b7/s only depends on the value of effective coupling of transverse gravitons evaluated on the horizon [13, 14, 15, 16]. Under in\nthe hydrodynamic limit, it was generally proven that some linear response coefficients are\nuniversal both in the AdS/CFT correspondence and membrane paradigm [14]. In particular, one can consider a fictitious membrane at a constant radial radius to express the\nAdS/CFT response in terms of the membrane paradigm language [14]. The dependence\nof the diffusion constant of dual fluid on the cutoff surface is interpreted as the Wilson\nrenormalization group flow [17]. Some studies relating the radial radius of AdS space to\nenergy scale of dual CFT appear in [18, 19, 20]. Some forms of holographic renormalizaton\ngroup flow equation independent of the cutoff were given recently in [21, 22, 23] and it\nwas generally proven in [24] that they are actually equivalent to the radial evolution of the\nclassical equation of motion [17].\nSince the Wilson renormalization group flow theory does not require an ultraviolet completion of quantum field theory, the authors of [17] also do not insist on an asymptotically\nAdS region, instead they introduce a finite cutoff rc outside the horizon in a general class of\np + 2-dimensional black hole geometries. The dispersion relation of the gravitational fluctuations confined inside the cutoff is shown at long wavelengths to be that of a linearized\np + 1-dimensional Navier-Stokes (NS) fluid living on the cutoff surface [17, 25, 26]. This\nremarkable relation was investigated in [25] that a given solution of the incompressible\nNS equations maps to a unique solution of the vacuum Einstein equations. An algorithm\nwas presented in [26] for systematically reconstructing a solution for the p + 2-dimensional\nvacuum Einstein equations from a p + 1-dimensional fluid, to arbitrary order by extending\nthe non-relativistic hydrodynamic expansion proposed in [25].\nClearly it is of great interest to develop a holography fluid description dual to an\nasymptotically flat gravitational configuration by introducing a finite cutoff. In this paper, however, we discuss this issue in asymptotically AdS gravity by introducing a finite\nradial cutoff, because when one takes the cutoff to be infinity, the dual field theory on the\nAdS boundary is well-defined and some results are comparable to those in the literatures.\nClearly such a study could be a service to further discuss the case in asymptotically flat\nspacetimes.\nNote that one can construct the stress energy tensor of the dual fluid order by order from\nthe bulk gravity solution [27]. In this paper we follow the procedures in [14, 17, 25, 26], by\nintroducing a finite cutoff surface \u03a3c outside black hole horizon, generally discuss the effect\nof finite perturbations of the extrinsic curvature of \u03a3c while keeping the intrinsic metric\nof the cutoff surface flat [25]. By applying two finite diffeomorphism transformations, in\nthe non-relativistic hydrodynamic expansion limit we obtain black brane solutions, up to\nsecond order, of the non-relativistic hydrodynamic expansion parameter \u01eb, between the\ncutoff surface and the horizon in Einstein gravity with a negative cosmological constant.\nWe calculate the stress energy tensor of the fluid on the cutoff surface. The results show\nthat the ratio \u03b7/s is still 1/4\u03c0, independent of the cutoff, which implies that it does not\nrun along the radial coordinate. And it turns out that the stress energy tensor of the\nfluid obeys the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. We also discuss the case of Gauss2\n\n\fBonnet gravity with a negative cosmological constant.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec.(2) we introduce two finite diffeomorphism\ntransformations to a general metric dual to fluid in flat spacetime, while keeping the induced metric of the cutoff surface invariant. We make the non-relativistic hydrodynamic\nexpansion and solve gravitational equations to the second order of the expansion parameter.\nIn Sec.(3) we apply this formulism to Einstein gravity with a negative cosmological constant. We find that the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density of dual fluid on the finite\ncutoff surface \u03b7/s = 1/4\u03c0, independent of the cutoff and that the conservation equation of\nthe stress energy tensor of the dual fluid gives an incompressible Navier-Stokes equation.\nIn Sec.(4) we consider the case of Gauss-Bonnet gravity with a negative cosmological constant. The ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density is found to be \u03b7/s = (1 \u2212 8\u03b1)/4\u03c0,\nand corresponding incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are also obtained there. The\nconclusions and some discussions are included in Sec.(5).\n\n2\n\nNon-relativistic hydrodynamic expansion\n\nTo study the dynamics of fluid in p + 1-dimensional flat spacetime, we consider a generic\np + 2-dimensional metric:\nds2p+2 = \u2212h(r)d\u03c4 2 + 2d\u03c4 dr + a(r)dxi dxi ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere h(r) and a(r) are two functions of radial coordinate r. Introducing a finite cutoff\nsurface \u03a3c at r = rc (outside black hole horizon if the horizon is present), the induced\nmetric on the surface is flat\n\u03b3ab dxa dxb = \u2212h(rc )d\u03c4 2 + a(rc )dxi dxi ,\nwhere xa \u223c (\u03c4, xi ). Introduce proper intrinsic coordinates x\u0303a \u223c (\u03c4\u0303 , x\u0303i ) on \u03a3c as\np\np\nx\u03030 \u2261 \u03c4\u0303 = h(rc )\u03c4, x\u0303i = a(rc )xi\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nthe induced metric is simply given by\n\nds2p+1 = \u03b7ab dx\u0303a dx\u0303b = \u2212d\u03c4\u0303 2 + \u03b4ij dx\u0303i dx\u0303j .\n\n(4)\n\nIn order to keep the intrinsic metric of \u03a3c flat, following [26] we take two finite diffeomorphism transformations. The first one is a Lorentz boost with a constant boost parameter\n\u03b2i .

When h(r) = r, a(r) = 1, the metric (1) just describes a flat spacetime written in the ingoing Rindler coordinates, and the transformations (5) and (9) agree\nwith those in [26] if we take k(r) = r \u2212 rh .\nAfter taking the two coordinate transformations one after another, the resulted metric\nstill solves the corresponding gravitational field equations. But if we further promote vi\nand \u03b4k(r) \u2261 k(r) \u2212 r = (b \u2212 1) r + c to be dependent on the coordinates xa , (that is\nvi , b, c are no longer constants), the transformed metric is no longer an exact solution of\ngravitational field equations. In order to solve the gravity equations of motion, we take\nthe so-called hydrodynamics expansion and non-relativistic limit.

Consider k(r) as a following transformation\nk(r) = r(1 \u2212 P ) \u21d2 \u03b4k(r) = \u2212rP,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere P is a small\nparameter. As will be shown shortly, in fact, the parameter P multiplied\nrc h\u2032 (rc )\nby a factor 2h(rc ) is the pressure density of the dual fluid.\nSubstituting (17) and (18) in (14), the first line of the metric with different f (r) solves\nthe equations of motion for the corresponding gravity with a negative cosmological constant\nexactly. The remainder terms in (14) could be treated as the perturbations of the metric, as\n(vi , P ) will turn out to be the small parameters of the dual non-relativistic fluid. To be more\nspecific, we consider vi = vi (xi , \u03c4 ) and P = P (xi , \u03c4 ) depending on the coordinates xa , but\nindependent of r, and take the non-relativistic hydrodynamic limit in (16), as well as (11).\nThen the metric (14) only solves corresponding gravity equations with the cosmological\nat order \u01eb1 . In order to solve the equations to the next order, we need\nconstant \u039b = \u2212 p(p+1)\n2\nto add correction terms to the metric [26, 27]. Let's consider the constraint equation first\n[27]. At order \u01eb2 , we find that there is only one nontrivial constraint condition: \u2202i v i = 0.\n5\n\n\fThis will turn out to be the incompressibility of the dual fluid. With this constraint\ncondition, it turns out that at order \u01eb2 , the source terms only have tensor modes and only\nthe following tensor correction terms need to be added to the metric:\nr2\nF (r)(\u2202i vj + \u2202j vi )dxi dxj\nrc2\n\n(19)\n\nwhere F (r) is chosen to cancel the source terms at order \u01eb2 and to keep regular at the\nhorizon. In order to keep the induced metric \u03b3ab invariant, we also need to choose the\ngauge such that F (rc ) = 0 [26].

Additionally,\nthe integral upper bound has been chosen to keep \u03b3ab invariant and this matches the result\nin [28] when we take the cutoff surface to infinity. With the constraint condition \u2202i v i = 0,\nthe metric (20) solves the Einstein's field equations (21) at order \u01eb2 , i.e., E\u03bc\u03bd = O(\u01eb3 ).

We have checked the result and shown that\nthey match with the stress energy tensor of the dual fluid on the boundary [37].\nIn this case, we find that the dynamic viscosity\n\u03b7c = [1 \u2212 2\u03b1 (2fc + rc fc\u2032 )] (1 + rc2 fc Fc\u2032 ) =\n\n1 rh3\n(1 \u2212 8\u03b1) .\n16\u03c0G rc3\n\n(65)\n\nThe black brane entropy density associated with the cutoff surface is given by\nsc =\n\n1 rh3\n4G rc3\n\n\u03b7c\n1\n=\n(1 \u2212 8\u03b1) .\nsc\n4\u03c0\n\n=\u21d2\n\n(66)\n\nThis ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density is the same as that of the dual fluid to\nthe Gauss-Bonnet gravity on the boundary [9, 10, 11, 12].

We have calculated the stress\nenergy tensor of the dual fluid on the cutoff surface through the Brown-York tensor on the\nsurface [17]. And then we have discussed some properties of the dual fluid. It turns out\nthat the dual fluid is an incompressible one in both cases, obeys the Navier-Stokes equations, but with different kinematic viscosity. In both cases, the ratio of shear viscosity to\nentropy density is independent of the cutoff, it means that the ratio does not run with the\ncutoff surface. When one moves the cutoff surface to spatial infinity, namely takes the limit\nrc \u2192 \u221e, our results can recover those for dual fluids on the boundary of AdS space [27]. In\nthe near horizon limit, our results should also be in contact with the membrane paradigm\nin [41], where the horizon dynamics is described by incompressible Navier-Stokes equations\nin the non-relativistic hydrodynamic limit.\nOur results presented in this paper together with those in [17, 25, 26] show that the\nfluids on a finite cutoff surface always obey the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, for\ndual gravity solutions up to second order of the non-relativistic hydrodynamic expansion\nparameter. This may reveal some insights for the holographic dual to asymptotically flat\nspacetimes. The study of holography on a finite cutoff may also be helpful to understand\nthe microscopic origin of gravity. It is shown in [17] that the entropy flow equation along\nthe radial coordinate is equivalent to a radial Einstein equation. We have checked that\nthis also holds in the Gauss-Bonnet gravity.\nFinally we would like to stress that the black brane solutions obtained in this paper\nare up to second order of the non-relativistic hydrodynamic expansion parameter \u01eb. In\nprinciple, following [26], we can obtain corresponding black brane solutions to an arbitrary\norder of the expansion parameter. With the resulting solutions, by calculating the corresponding Brown-York tensor in the gravity side, we can obtain the stress energy tensor of\ndual fluids on the cutoff surface, and then obtain other transport coefficients of the dual\nfluids.\n14\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China\n(No.10821504, No.10975168 and No.11035008), and in part by the Ministry of Science and\nTechnology of China under Grant No. 2010CB833004.
