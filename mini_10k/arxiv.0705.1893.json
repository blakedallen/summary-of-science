Attention is given to the influence of mixing angle \u03b813\non the expected rates and spectra of neutrino events.\n\nIntroduction\n\nNeutrino fluxes of natural origin are known to carry information both about their sources inaccessible to direct\nobservation and about the properties of the neutrino themselves.\nWe consider a program of research on natural low-energy (< 100 MeV) antineutrino fluxes using a large scintillation\nspectrometer to be installed at Baksan Neutrino Observatory (BNO) of the Institute for Nuclear Research, Russian\nAcademy of Sciences, at a depth of \u223c5000 m.w.e. The planned spectrometer target mass is about 5 kt.\nThe main research directions and goals are the following:\n(1) Neutrino geophysics. Determining the radiogenic component of the Earth's heat flow through the detection of\nantineutrinos emitted by daughter uranium and thorium decay products; detrmining the total abundance of these\nelements in the Earth.\nTesting the hypothesis that a chain fission reaction is burning at the Earth's centre (\"georeactor\").\n(2) Neutrino Astrophysics. Studying the Supernova (SN) expolsion dynamics by recording the neutrino burst\nintensity and energy spectrum. Searching for an isotropic flux of antineutrinos accumulated in the Universe over\nseveral billion years during SN explosions and the formation of neutron stars and black holes.\nThe first section of the research program has been schematically considered in recent publications [1-4].\nThis paper is devoted to the possibilities of studying the neutrino burst when cores of high-mass stars gravitationally\ncollapse to produce SNe.\nThe burst of \"Thermal\" neutrinos begins simultaneously with gravitational collapse of the iron core of a high-mass\n(M \u2265 8M\u2299 ) star and lasts for about 20 s. All six types of active neutrinos are produced in a hot core: \u03bde , \u03bd \u0304e , \u03bd\u03bc , \u03bd \u0304\u03bc , \u03bd\u03c4\nand \u03bd \u0304\u03c4 . These neutrinos carry away the vast bulk of the gravitational energy, \u223c 3 \u00d7 1053 erg , released during the\ncollapse. Only several tens of minutes or several hours later does the exposion reach the surface, and a Supernova\nseen with the naked eye and by the methods of optical, X-ray, radio and gamma-ray astronomy flares up in the sky.\nOn competition of the explosion, the bulk of the stellar matter is dispersed in space and a neutron star (or a black\nhole) is left at the place of the core.\nBy neutrino burst onset, the inner part of the core becomes opaque to neutrinos because of its high density. Before\ntheir escape, the neutrinos are multiply scattered, absorbed and reemitted. The surface from which the neutrinos can\nleave the core is called a neutrinosphere. Because of the difference in interaction cross sections, the neutrinosphere\nradii differ for defferent types neutrinos. The \u03bd\u03bc , \u03bd \u0304\u03bc , \u03bd\u03c4 and \u03bd \u0304\u03c4 neutrinospheres (radius \u223c30 km) are deepest, the \u03bd \u0304e\nneutrinosphere (\u223c50 km) follows next, and the latter is followed by the \u03bde neutrinosphere (\u223c70 km). This explains\nthe predicted difference in mean energies of the neutrinos escaping from the core. The larger the radius, the lower the\nmean energy. However, as calculations show, all types of neutrinos divide the collapse energy carried away by them\napproximately evenly.\nA short pulse (\u223c 10\u22122 s) of electron neutrinos, \u03bde , produced via neutronization of the core that reached the stability\n(Chandrasekhar) limit is emitted immediately before the \"thermal\" pulse. These \u03bde 's with energies 15-20 MeV, carry\naway 5-10% of the energy released during the collapse.\nStudying the neutrino bursts in labratories is a powerful tool for investigating the energetics and dynamics of\ncollapsing stars and the properties of neutrinos themselves.\nThe existence of a neutrino burst that accompanies collapse was first pointed out in 1965 [5]. Intensive calculations\nof the SN explosion dynamics and neutrino emission were performed in succeeding years [6-9]. There are a number\nof detailed reviews (see [10, 11] and references therein). A neutrino burst detection method was also suggested in\n1965 [12]: a statistically significant series of signals must be observed in a massive low-background neutrino detector.\n\n\f2\nHowever a SN explosion is a very rare event (one SN explosion in \u223c30 years is expected in our Galaxy). Therefore,\nthe authors of [12] suggested synchronizing the operation of various detectors to increase reliability and information\ncontent. In our days there exists The International SuperNova Early Warning System (SNEWS) that combines all of\nthe detectors capable of detecting SN neutrinos is currently operating.\nThe neutrinos produced during collapse play an important role in nucleosynthesis [15-17]. The observed abundances\nof several light elements (9 Be, 11 B, 19 F, and others), and the abundances of so-called bypassed elementes heavier than\niron, can be explained in terms of neutrino reactions within \u223c1000 km of the stellar core centre.\nThe signal from SN 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud was recordered on February 23, 1987, with three neutrino\ndetectors - KII in Japan, IMB in the USA and the Baksan detector. This signal was analyzed in details in a number\nof papers (see, e.g. [18, 19]). A total of 24 neutrinos were recordered in the above detectors (the explosion occured\nat a distance of 50 kpc, which a factor 5 larger than the mean distance from the Earth to the stars of our Galaxy).\nOn the whole, the picture obtained is consistent with the outlined neutrino burst scenario, although poor statistics\nseverely limits the information content of the analysis.\nNote that SN neutrino burst detection is an oscillation experiment with a baseline of \u223c30 thousand light years and\nthat the neutrinos produced in the star traverse regions that are a factor of \u223c 109 denser than the matter the solar\ncenter. The flavour composition of neutrinos incident on the detector depends on the mixing parameter sin2 \u03b813 and\non the type of mass hierarchy (normal or inversed) [20, 21]. The conversions \u03bd \u0304\u03bc , \u03bd \u0304\u03c4 =\u21d2 \u03bd \u0304e open the possibility of\nstudying the intensities and energies of \u03bd \u0304\u03bc and \u03bd \u0304\u03c4 , whose signal is virtually impossible to isolate directly by currently\navailable methods.\nBelow, we (1) schematically describe the neutrino detector, (2) give the characteristics of a \"standard\" thermal\nneutrino burst, (3) calculate the spectra and rates of expected neutrino events in the detector, (4) consider the effects\nof oscillations on the number and spectrum of neutrino events and, (5), in conclusion, discuss our results.\nI.\n\nNEUTRINO DETECTOR\n\nThe planned detector will consist of three concentric zones. The central spherical zone abouit 23 m in diameter is\nfilled with a liquid organic scintillator and serves as a target for neutrinos. The target is separated from the second\nzone filled with a nonscintillating oil by a strong transparent film. Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are installed on the\nsurface of the second zone and view the target through \u223c4-meter layer of liquid. The outer zone of the detector is an\nanticoincidence zone. It is separated from second zone by an opaque metall structure filled with water (or oil) and is\nviewed by PMTs that record Cerenkov radiation from cosmic muons and showers. The outer size of the detector is\n\u223c33 m.\nThe PMT photocathodes viewing the target cover about 25% of the surface. The expected signal is 80-100 photoelectrons per 1 MeV.\nThe main difference between the detector under consideration and the already existing LVD [21] and SNO [22]\ndetectors, which are capable of detecting a neutrino burst, is a larger target mass, a good energy resolution, a low\ndetection threshold, and the ability to detect \"terrestrial\" antineutrinos. The detector under construction is closest in\nstructure to the KamLAND array [23], differing from it by a larger target mass and a deeper position underground.\nThe recently suggested LENA project [24] has a program similar to ours, but it supposes constructing a detector with\nmuch larger target mass.\nThe main (in time) mode of operation of the spectrometer is a set of statistics of events generated by terrestrial\nantineutrinos produced via 238 U and 232 Th decays and by the hypothetical georeactor [1-4]. The number of useful\nevents of this type is \u223c500 per year. In the mode of neutrino burst detection, the expected number of events can\nreach several thousand over a period of \u223c20 s.\nII.\n\nTHE THERMAL NEUTRINO BURST\n\nWe calculate the expected effects in the detector based on the quantitative characteristics of the neutrino burst\ngiven below.\n(1) Thermal neutrinos carry away an energy of 3 \u00d7 1053 erg, which is divided evenly between the six flavours:\n\u03bde , \u03bd \u0304e , \u03bd\u03bc , \u03bd \u0304\u03bc , \u03bd\u03c4 and \u03bd \u0304\u03c4 .\n(2) The neutrino energy distribution is described by Fermi-Dirac distribution with an additional factor that provides\na faster falloff of the spectrum at high neutrino energies:\n\nN (E)dE =\n\nC * E 2 dE \u2212\u03b1(E/T )2\ne\n,\n1 + eE/T\n\n(1)\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 1: Spectra of the neutrinos incident on the detector (without oscillations), \u03bdx = \u03bd\u03bc , \u03bd \u0304\u03bc , \u03bd\u03c4 , \u03bd \u0304\u03c4 .\n\nTABLE I: Characteristics of the thermal neutrino burst (the SN distance is 10 kpc, without oscillations)\nNeutrino flavour\n\u03bde\n\u03bd \u0304e\n\u03bdx\u2217\n52\nCarried-away energy W , 10 erg\n5\n5\n5\u2217\u2217\nTemperature T , MeV\n3.5\n4.5\n8\nDimensionless parameter \u03b1\n0.01 0.02\n0\u2217\u2217\nMean neutrino energy < E >/MeV 10.3 12.5 25.2\u2217\u2217\nFlux \u03bd on detector N0i , 1011 /cm2 2.537 2.088 1.035\u2217\u2217\n\u03bdx = \u03bd\u03bc , \u03bd \u0304\u03bc , \u03bd\u03c4 , \u03bd \u0304\u03c4\nrelates to each \u03bdx neutrino\n\nwhere C is the normalization constant, E and T \u2212 are the energy and temperature (in MeV) and \u03b1 << 1 is a\ndimensionless parameter.\nThe numerical values of the quantities that characterize spectrum (1) were taken from [7] (see Table I).\nThe last two lines in Table I give the mean neutrino energies of neutrino calculated from distribution (1) and the\nburst-time-integrated flux densities of various types of neutrinos on the detector. The distance from the collapsing\nstar to the detector was assumed to be 10 kpc (remind that 1 pc \u2248 3.086 \u00d7 1018 cm).\nThe spectra of the neutrinos incident on the detector are shown in figure 1. Note a peculiarity of our model that\nis important for subsequent analysis: the \u03bdx neutrinos = (\u03bd\u03bc , \u03bd \u0304\u03bc , \u03bd\u03c4 , \u03bd \u0304\u03c4 ) have an appreciably harder spectrum than \u03bde\nand \u03bd \u0304e .\nIII.\n\nNEUTRINO REACTIONS IN THE DETECTOR\n\nIn this section we consider the effects expected in the detector without neutrino oscillations. (see the second line\nin Table II). We assume that the useful target volume contains 4 \u00d7 1032 hydrogen atoms, 2 \u00d7 1032 12 C atoms, and\n16 \u00d7 1032 electrons.\n3.1.

The oscillations of the neutrinos produced in a stellar core on their way to the detector were considered in\ndetail in [20].\n\n\f5\n\nFIG. 2: Cross sections for interactions of neutrinos with\n\n12\n\nC in the channels of neutral and charge currents.\n\nFIG. 3: Cross sections of neutrino interaction on electron.\n\nBecause of the \u03bd \u0304e \u21d0\u21d2 \u03bd \u0304\u03bc , \u03bd \u0304\u03c4 , and \u03bde \u21d0\u21d2 \u03bd\u03bc , \u03bd\u03c4 transitions the intensities and spectra of the neutrinos reaching the\ndetector change noticeably compared to the initial ones given in table I, which were used to obtain the results of the\nprevious section in this paper. The probabilities of these oscillation transitions depend on several factors.\n(1) On the amplitudes Ue1 , Ue2 and Ue3 , with which mass states m1 , m2 , m3 enter into the superposition of \u03bd \u0304e and\n\u03bde flavour states. In recent years, it has been established (see e.g. [27, 28]), that large mixing angle (LMA) case\noccurs in Nature. In the subsequent we assume that\ntan2 \u03b812 \u2261| Ue2 /Ue1 |2 = 0.40,\n\n(4)\n\n\f6\n| Ue1 |2 = 0.7, | Ue2 |2 = 0.3\nThe small, but important quantity |Ue3 |2 \u2261 sin2 \u03b813 remains unceratin. The following experimental constraint was\nobtained for it:\n|Ue3 |2 \u2261 sin2 \u03b813 \u2264 0.03 (CHOOZ [29])\n\n(4a)\n\n(2) On the influence of stellar matter influence and on the presence and nature of resonances (adiabatic, nonadiabatic) in the stellar matter with a variable density (the Mikheev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein, (MSW) effect).\n(3) On the type of mass hierarchy (normal, m23 >> m21 , or inverted m23 << m21 ). For normal and inverted mass\nhierarchies, respectevely, \u03bde and \u03bd \u0304e undergo the resonant conversions.\nBelow, we will consider normal mass hierarchy, making one exclusion that clearly demonstrates the role of type of\nmass hierarchy . For brevity, we will disregard the influence of the Earth's matter on the neutrino way to the detector.\n4.2. Let us now consider the changes in the observed picture of events to which the oscillations \u03bd \u0304e \u21d0\u21d2 \u03bd \u0304\u03bc , \u03bd \u0304\u03c4 lead.\nThe spectrum of \u03bd \u0304e neutrinos incident on the detector, dosc N\u03bd \u0304e /dE\u03bd \u0304e , is given relation\ndosc N\u03bd \u0304e\ndN\u03bd \u0304e\ndN\u03bdx\ndN\u03bdx\n= |Ue1 |2\n+ |Ue2 |2\n+ |Ue3 |2\n,\ndE\u03bd \u0304e\ndE\u03bd \u0304e\ndE\u03bdx\ndE\u03bdx\n\n(5)\n\ni.e.,\ndosc N\u03bd \u0304e\ndN\u03bd \u0304e\ndN\u03bdx\ndN\u03bd \u0304e\ndN\u03bdx\n= |Ue1 |2\n+ (1 \u2212 |Ue1 |2 )\n\u2248 0.7\n+ 0.3\ndE\u03bd \u0304e\ndE\u03bd \u0304e\ndE\u03bdx\ndE\u03bd \u0304e\ndE\u03bdx\nRelation (5) implies that 70% of the initial soft \u03bd \u0304e 's reach the detector in an unchanged form and 30% of the initial\nhard \u03bdx are added to them in the form of \u03bd \u0304e 's. As a result, the number of events of inverse beta-decay reaction (2)\nincreases (see Table II) and a hard component appears in the spectrum of positrons from this reaction (figure 4a). In\naddition the number of events of the reaction \u03bd \u0304e + 12 C \u2192 12 B + e+ increases by several times. Of course the total\nnumber of neutrinos is conserved and 30% of the initial \u03bd \u0304e turn into \u03bd \u0304x .\n4.3. In the process \u03bde \u21d0\u21d2 \u03bd\u03bc , \u03bd\u03c4 , a resonance whose nature depends on the small parameter |Ue3 |2 = sin2 \u03b813 is\nobserved in stellar matter.\nIn sin2 \u03b813 > 10\u22123 , then only a negligible fraction of the initial soft \u03bde reaches the detector, in fact, the entire flux\nof hard \u03bde is determined by the \u03bdx \u2192 \u03bde transition.\ndN\u03bde\ndN\u03bdx\ndN\u03bdx\ndosc N\u03bde\n= |Ue3 |2\n+ (1 \u2212 |Ue3 |2 )\n\u2248\ndE\u03bde\ndE\u03bde\ndE\u03bdx\ndE\u03bdx\n\n(6)\n\nAs a result, the number of events of the reaction \u03bde + 12 C \u2192 12 N + e\u2212 increases by a factor of \u223c 20 (Table II). The\ntotal number of recoil electrons from neutrino scattering by electrons changes insignificantly.\nIf, alternatively, sin2 \u03b813 < 10\u22125 , then 30% , (i.e., |Ue2 |2 ) of the initial soft \u03bde reaches the detector, and 70%\n(1 \u2212 |Ue2 |2 ) of the initial hard \u03bdx turn into \u03bde . Thus, for sin2 \u03b813 > 10\u22123 , the \u03bde spectrum contains more hard\nneutrinos than for sin2 \u03b813 < 10\u22125 .\n4.4. Let us also consider the case of inverted neutrino mass hierarchy, m23 << m21 . The MSW resonance now occurs\nduring \u03bd \u0304e \u21d0\u21d2 \u03bd \u0304\u03bc , \u03bd \u0304\u03c4 transitions and depends on sin2 \u03b813 .\nIf sin2 \u03b813 > 10\u22123 , then the incident flux dosc N\u03bd \u0304e /dE\u03bd \u0304e is determined almost entirely by the hard \u03bd \u0304x that turned\ninto \u03bd \u0304e :\ndosc N\u03bd \u0304e\ndN\u03bdx\n\u2248\n.\ndE\u03bd \u0304e\ndE\u03bdx\n\n(7)\n\nAs a result, the total number of events of reaction (2) reaches \u223c2200 and an intense peak of hard e+ will be observed\nin the positron spectrum (see figure 4b).\nIf, alternatively, sin2 \u03b813 < 10\u22125 , then the spectrum of \u03bd \u0304e incident on the detector is identical to spectrum (5) that\nhas already been considered above and the positron spectrum does not differ from the shown at figure 4a.\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe parameter |Ue3 |2 = sin2 \u03b813 plays an important role in the physics of weak interactions. CP-invariance violations\nin the neutrino sector are possible only if |Ue3 |2 6= 0. Ways of improving the experiment limitations on the parameter\n\n\f7\n\nFIG. 4: Spectra of the positrons from the inverse beta-decay reaction (2) with oscillations: (a) Spectrum for normal mass\nhierarchy, (b) spectrum for inverted mass hierarchy, under the condition sin2 \u03b813 > 10\u22123 .\n\nand achieving a better sensitivity were suggested immediately after constraint (4b) was obtained on the CHOOZ\nreactor [30]. At present, preparations are being made for new experiments in the field of the reactors of many\ncountries (see [31] for a brief review). These experiments should be able improve result (4b) by a factor of 5-7.\nThe dependence of the spectrum and number of neutrino events on sin2 \u03b813 (Table II, figure 4) gives hope that this\nparameter will be determined with a good sensitivity in future astrophysical observations.\nDetection of a neutrino burst can give more information than mentioned above.\nThe processes that take place in the core of a star within the first seconds after its collapse are very complex. It is\nnot surprising that specialists in this field have failed to reach a consensus of opinion on the spectral composition of\nthe emitted neutrinos even after several decades of intensive calculations. Above we used a model ([7], figure 1), in\nwhich \u03bdx = \u03bd\u03bc , \u03bd \u0304\u03bc , \u03bd\u03c4 , \u03bd \u0304\u03c4 have appreciably higher mean energies than \u03bde and \u03bd \u0304e . At the ssame time, there are studies\n\n\f8\nTABLE III: Characteristics of the thermal burst neutrino spectrum form various sources\n< E\u03bde >, MeV < E\u03bdx >, MeV cite\n12.5\n25.2\n[7]\n21.6\n[9]\n15.4\n11.4\n14.1\n[32]\n15.7\n[33]\n15.4\n\u2248 10 \u2212 12\u2217\n\u2248 25\n[34]\nThe mean value for \u03bd \u0304e and \u03bde\n\nyear\n1980\n1998\n2003\n2003\n2005\n\nsuggesting that the \u03bdx and \u03bd \u0304e energies are close [32] or almost equal [33], while [34] gives data similar to those in [7]\n(see table III).\nWhat is the dynamics of the core interior temperature within the first seconds after the core collapse? How does\nthe neutrino burst flare up and fade out? How the neutrino gas cools down in the burst time? And, finally, does a\nrapidly rotating star actually collapses in two stages separated in time, as explained in detail in [35]? Only analysis\nof a future neutrino burst can give answers to these questions.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank O.G. Ryazhskaya, D.K. Nadyozhin and A.Yu.
