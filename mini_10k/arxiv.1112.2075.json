In\ntheoretical studies on this quantum Hamiltonian1\u20138 , the\nexact diagonalization method (ED), the density matrix\nrenormalization group method (DMRG)9\u201311 and the infinite time-evolving block decimation method (iTEBD)12\nwere used as powerful methods in order to determine\nnovel quantum phases.\nIn the DMRG and the iTEBD methods, variational\nstates take the form of a matrix product state (MPS)13,14\nand an infinite MPS (iMPS)12 , respectively. When the\ndimension of matrices constructing the MPS is one, the\nMPS corresponds to the MFA. As the dimension m increases, the optimum variational state approaches the exact one systematically. In addition, the MPS can handle\ninfinite system-size directly if we suppose the spatial homogeneity of the MPS as in the iTEBD. As a merit of the\nspatially uniform MPS or iMPS, there are no boundary\neffects which always appear in the DMRG.\nIn the zigzag chain1\u20138 , the helical magnetic order with\nincommensurate period is known to be a solution of the\nclassical vector spin Heisenberg model which is valid in\nthe large spin limit (S \u226b 1). The incommensurate properties appear due to the geometrical frustration. To deal\nwith quantum fluctuation, one can use the MPS. However, the spatially uniform MPS with finite dimension\ncannot express the helical magnetic order, because its\nlocal magnetic moment becomes spatially uniform. On\nthe other hand, the DMRG can deal with a spatially inhomogeneous magnetic order, but the boundary affects\nincommensurate period of the order.\nIn this study, we propose a simple incommensurate (IC) MPS with incommensurate periodicity applying spin rotation operators15 to the spatially uni-\n\nform MPS. This IC-MPS is understood naturally as\na quantum generalization of the classical vector spin\nanalysis. This framework is independent of the type\nof numerical optimization process, and it is applicable for various variational methods based on finite dimensional MPSs: DMRG9\u201311 , the wave function predictions based on the product wave function renormalization group (PWFRG) method16\u201320 , the tensor product state (TPS)21,22 , the projected entangled pair state\n(PEPS)23 , iTEBD12 , the infinite PEPS (iPEPS)24 , the\ntree tensor network (TTN) state25 , the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) state26 , and so\non. To demonstrate our light-weight modification for the\nuniform MPS with small dimension of matrices m, the\nmodified Powell method27 is used as a general purpose\noptimization method in this paper.\nA pitch angle which determines an incommensurate\nperiod is a variational parameter in our approach. The\npitch angle plays an important role in the optimization\nof the variational energy. This is caused by the finite m\neffect, because any state can be expressed by the MPS\nwith infinite m. However, in the analysis of quantum\neffect starting from the classical vector spin model our\napproach shows a fast convergence with respect to m\nand a result obtained by tiny m is consistent with IC\nspin-spin correlation properties1,3 .\nThe spatial periodicity and translational symmetry are\nrecent hot topics for the MPS and its generalization28\u201332 .\nOur previous study32 shown that in the spatially uniform\nMPS the translational symmetry breaking appeared in\nprincipal eigenvalues of its transfer matrix; that is, the\ndegeneracy of eigenvalues was consistent with the ground\nstate periodicity. This means that we need large dimension of matrices for the spatially uniform MPS with onesite periodicity to express a magnetic ordered state with\np-site commensurate periodicity. To reduce computational memory without loosing the numerical accuracy,\np-site periodic MPS was effective32 . However, as shown\nin this study, we succeed in reducing more computational\nmemory using the IC-MPS.\nThis paper is organized as follows.\nIn \u00a7II, we\nreview the interaction-round-a-face (IRF)/vertex-type\n\n\f2\nMPS32\u201334 and propose the IC-MPS. The MFA limit of\nthe IC-MPS is discussed in \u00a7III, where we show that\nthe optimum vertex-type IC-MPS with m = 1 in the\nS = 1/2 Heisenberg chain is equivalent to the state from\nthe MFA. In \u00a7IV, observing the m dependence of local\nmagnetization in the S = 1/2 Heisenberg chain, we confirm the IC-MPS takes into account the quantum fluctuation gradually by increasing m. In the same section,\nthe effectiveness of the IC-MPS is demonstrated in the\nmagnetization curve of S = 1/2 Heisenberg chain and\nthe S = 1/2 F-AF zigzag chain under uniform magnetic\nfield. Then, we discuss the reduced computational cost\nby applying the spin rotation in the S = 1/2 Heisenberg\nchain and the C-IC change with respect to the spin-spin\ncorrelation in the zigzag chain1\u20133,7,8 .\nII.\n\nMATRIX PRODUCT STATE WITH AN\nINCOMMENSURATE PERIOD\n\nLet us recall the IRF/vertex-type MPS32\u201334 . An IRFtype MPS with N site is\n#\n\"\nN\n\u22121\nX\nY\n\u03c3i \u03c3i+1\n\u03c3N \u03c31\n|\u03c3i,\n(1)\nAi\n|\u03a8i =\nTr A0\n\u03c3\n\ni=1\n\nwhere \u03c3i means the index of spin at ith site and \u03c3 =\n\u03c3 \u03c3\n\u03c3 \u03c3\n\u03c31 * * * \u03c3N . The variables A0 N 1 and Ai i i+1 are m \u00d7 m\n\u03c3 \u03c3\nsquare complex matrices. The matrix A0 N 1 is called\n13,14,32,35\nthe boundary matrix\n. A vertex-type MPS is\n\u03c3 \u03c3\nrepresented under the constraints: A0 N 1 = A\u03c3N A0 and\n\u03c3i \u03c3i+1\n\u03c3\nAi\n= Ai i . To handle the thermodynamic limit\n(N \u2192 \u221e), hereafter, we treat a uniform MPS, namely\n\u03c3 \u03c3\nAi i i+1 = A\u03c3i \u03c3i+1 . As in the previous study32 , one can\ntreat the p-site periodic MPS.\nTo construct an IC-MPS, we use a spin-rotational operator at each ith site15 :\nR\u0302i (ni , Qi ) = exp(\u2212\u0131Qi \u015di * ni ),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u0131 means a unit of pure imaginary number and \u015di\nrepresents the local spin operator. The unit vector of\nrotational axis and angle at each site are represented by\nni and Qi , respectively. In this paper, we limit ourselves\nto the simple case of ni = n and Qi = iQ.\nThen, the IC-MPS is given by\n#\n\"\nY\nR\u0302i (n, iQ) |\u03a8i = R\u0302tot (n, Q)|\u03a8i. (3)\n|\u03a8, n, Qi =\ni\n\nA schematic picture of the wave function of IC-MPS is\ndepicted in Fig. 1, where Ri means a matrix representation of the operator R\u0302i .\nThe variational energy for a Hamiltonian \u0124 is given\nby e(\u03a8, n, Q) = limN \u2192\u221e E(\u03a8, n, Q)/N with\nE(\u03a8, n, Q) = h\u03a8, n, Q|\u0124|\u03a8, n, Qi/h\u03a8, n, Q|\u03a8, n, Qi\n= h\u03a8|\u0124(n, Q)|\u03a8i/h\u03a8|\u03a8i,\n\u0124(n, Q) =\n\n\u2020\nR\u0302tot\n(n, Q)\u0124 R\u0302tot (n, Q),\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\nVertex-type IC-MPS\n\nFIG. 1.

Then,\nhereafter, we just consider \u0124(n, Q).\nFor general ni and Qi , the important characters of\nthe spin-rotated operator are summarized below. The\nrotated local spin operator in general spin S is given by\n\u015di (ni , Qi ) = R\u0302i\u2020 (ni , Qi )\u015di R\u0302i (ni , Qi ) = D(ni , Qi )\u015di , (6)\nwhere the three dimensional matrix D(ni , Qi ) is given\nby\n\u0002\n\u0003\nD(v, q) \u03b7\u03b7\u2032 = v\u03b7 v\u03b7\u2032 + (\u03b4\u03b7\u03b7\u2032 \u2212 v\u03b7 v\u03b7\u2032 ) cos q\nX\n\u2212 sin q\n\u01eb\u03b7\u03b7\u2032 \u03b7\u2032\u2032 v\u03b7\u2032\u2032 ,\n(7)\n\u03b7 \u2032\u2032\n\nfor the unit vector v. Symbols \u03b4\u03b7\u03b7\u2032 and \u01eb\u03b7\u03b7\u2032 \u03b7\u2032\u2032 represent\nthe Kronecker delta and the Levi-Civita symbol, respectively, where \u03b7 = x, y, z. From Eq. (7), we can immediately obtain the relation D(ni , Qi )t = D(ni , \u2212Qi ).\nFor the simple case of ni = n and Qi = iQ, one can\nprove the following equation:\n\u015di (n, iQ) * \u015di+l (n, (i + l)Q) = \u015di * \u015di+l (n, lQ). (8)\nThe vanishing of position dependence simplifies the calculation of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian. For the S = 1/2\nHeisenberg chain defined by\n\u01241 =\n\nX\n\n\u015di * \u015di+1 ,\n\n(9)\n\ni\n\nthe spin-rotated Hamiltonian \u01241 (n, Q) is written as\nX\nX\n\u0125i (n, Q). (10)\n\u015di * \u015di+1 (n, Q) =\n\u01241 (n, Q) =\ni\n\ni\n\nThis Hamiltonian has the translational symmetry. Then,\nwe apply the same uniform MPS used in the previous\nstudy32 . If the artificial translational-symmetry breaking does not occur, we can neglect the boundary matrix\nand the local energy ei = h\u03a8|\u0125i (n, Q)|\u03a8i becomes independent of position i in the thermodynamic limit. The\ntranslational symmetry of the spin-rotated Hamiltonian\nis recovered even for the zigzag and bilinear-biquadratic\nHeisenberg chain for general spin S.\n\n\f3\n1\n\nIt should be noted that we can deal with the case that\nthe spin-rotated Hamiltonian does not have the translational symmetry. In this case, we can calculate the\nvariational energy by using the translational symmetry\nof the MPS |\u03a8i, because the position dependence of the\nlocal energy ei can be expanded as\n\n1\n0.1\n\n\u2206E\n\n2\n\n4\n\nei = e(0) +\n\nX\n\ne(k) exp(\u0131ikQ)\n\n(11)\n\n0.001\n4\n\nk6=0\n\nand only e(0)Pgives non-zero contribution after taking the\nsummation i ei if Q is not commensurate. For commensurate Q, we must consider the contribution from\ne(k) for k 6= 0. Of course, one can treat more general\nposition-dependent rotations, for example Q2i = 2iQa\nand Q2i+1 = (2i + 1)Qb , where the expansion as in\nEq. (11) becomes more complex, namely ei = e(0,0) +\nP\n(ka ,kb )\nexp(\u0131i(ka Qa + kb Qb )).\n(ka ,kb )6=(0,0) e\nIII.\n\nMEAN FIELD APPROXIMATION LIMIT\n\nWe derive the mean-field limit of this method, which\nis realized by the vertex-type IC-MPS with m = 1. In\nthis limit, we can neglect the boundary A0 which has\nonly trivial two roles: normalization and phase factor.\nThen,\nP\nQ the\u03c3iMPS becomes a direct product state |\u03a8i =\u2191\n\u03c3\ni (A |\u03c3i i), expressed by two complex variables, A\nand A\u2193 P\nin S = 1/2 systems. As a normalization, we\nassume \u03c3i |A\u03c3i |2 = 1.\nTo show that the mean-field limit corresponds to the\nclassical vector spin model, we consider the Heisenberg\nHamiltonian, H1 . The variational energy is given by\ne(\u03a8, n, Q) = M * (D(n, Q)M ),\n\n(12)\n\nwith an\nvalue of local magnetic moment\nP expectation\n\u2032\nM = \u03c3,\u03c3\u2032 A\u03c3\u2217 A\u03c3 h\u03c3|\u015d|\u03c3 \u2032 i. The local magnetization is\npP\n\u03b1\n2\nobtained by |M | =\n\u03b1 h\u03a8|\u015d |\u03a8i . After the optimization for fixed Q, one can obtain\ne(Q) = min e(\u03a8, n, Q) = cos Q/4.\n\u03a8,n\n\n(13)\n\nThen, the optimization of e(Q) gives the N\u00e9el-type solution Q = \u03c0. We stress again that this energy gain of\ne(Q) \u2212 e(0) is due to finite m, because any state can be\nexpressed by the uniform (p = 1, Q = 0) MPS accurately\nif we have enough large dimension m for the MPS. This\nfinite-dimensionality also causes |M | = 1/2 which is always proved for any state in the mean-field limit, while\nit is known that the exact ground state does not have\nthe magnetization at zero magnetic field. In this sense,\nthe mean-field limit corresponds to the classical vector\nspin model.

We prepare the m-dimensional complex matrix A\u03c3i ,\u03c3i+1 for the IRF-type uniform MPS. The\nrotational axis n is fixed as (0, 0, 1) to conserve translational symmetry of the rotated uniaxial Hamiltonian with\nthe longitudinal magnetic-field Hz applied in z-axis. The\npitch Q and A\u03c3i ,\u03c3i+1 are optimized so that the variational\nenergy e for a given Hamiltonian \u0124 becomes minimum\nby using the modified Powell method27 . The number of\noptimization parameters in the IRF-type IC-MPS under\nfixed rotational axis is 2d2 m2 + 1, where the coefficient 2\ncomes from using complex numbers and d is the degree\nof freedom (DOF) of local spin, namely 2 in this work.\nThe term g+1h means the DOF of the wave number Q.\nIn the optimization, 10 \u2212 2000 initial states are prepared\nand optimized in each Hamiltonian parameter to avoid\nobtaining a local minimum.\nThe MPS gradually takes account of the quantum\nfluctuation of the local magnetic moment in the S=1/2\nHeisenberg chain with increasing m as shown in Fig. 2.\nThe rotational angle Q = \u03c0 is obtained after the optimization. The energy error \u2206E means the difference\nbetween optimized variational energies as function of m\nand the exact energy \u2212 ln 2+1/436 . The energy error and\nthe local magnetization |M | are monotonically decreasing with respect to m. We confirm that the IRF-type\nMPS can deal with non-zero quantum fluctuations even\nif m = 1, while the vertex-type MPS with m = 1 gives\nthe mean-field result. This is an advantage of using IRFtype MPS.\nThe magnetization Mz in the S = 1/2 Heisenberg\nchain with the magnetic-field Hz is shown in Fig. 3. As\nreference data, we show the exact result for S = 1/2 from\nthe Bethe ansatz36 and the result from two-site modulated MPS, named p = 2, Q = 0, in our previous study32 .\nWhile the mean field result fails to obtain the correct crit-\n\n\f4\n0\n\n0.5\nMean Field\np=1, Q=\u03c0, m=1\np=2, Q=0, m=1\np=1, Q=\u03c0, m=3\np=2, Q=0, m=3\nExact\n\nMz\n\n0.3\n\n-0.04\n\ne(Q) - e(0)\n\n0.4\n\n-0.02\n\n0.2\n0.1\n\n-0.06\n-0.08\n-0.1\n-0.12\nS = 1/2, m = 1\nHz = 0.0\nHz = 0.8\nHz = 1.6\nHz = 2.0\n\n-0.14\n-0.16\n-0.18\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nHz\nFIG. 3.

The\nrelative error of the magnetization curve from the ICMPS with m = 3 in Fig. 3 is smaller than 3% even\nthough the error of local magnetization |M | is of the\norder of that from the MFA as shown in Fig. 2; that is,\nthe absolute error of Mz in Fig. 3 is less than 0.001 even\nthough the error of |M | in Fig. 2 is about 0.1.\nMoreover, in both cases of m = 1 and m = 3, the\ndata from IC-MPS with Q = \u03c0 agree with that of the\np = 2, Q = 0 MPS. This means that the number of optimization parameter is reduced by 50% compared to the\nprevious study.\nHow the rotational pitch Q = \u03c0 is stabilized by the\nenergy gain, e(Q) \u2212 e(0), is shown in Fig. 4. This figure clearly shows that the variational energy becomes\nminimum at Q = \u03c0 for any magnetic field except for\nHz = 2.0 in the perfect-ferro region. Compared with\ne(Q) = cos Q/4 for Hz = 0 in the mean-field limit, there\nis the flat energy region in small Q region for Hz = 0.\nIn the flat region, we confirm the state is a superposition of the N\u00e9el state, namely the linear combination of\n| \u2191\u2193\u2191 . . .i and | \u2193\u2191\u2193 . . .i32 . This state is invariant with\nrespect to the spin rotation along z-axis trivially. The\norigin of the flat region is the quantum fluctuation of the\nN\u00e9el state. This quantum fluctuation can be expressed\nby the IRF even in m = 1.\nFinally, we discuss the periodicity change appearing in\nthe S = 1/2 F-AF (J1 < 0 and J2 > 0) zigzag Heisenberg\nchain with uniform longitudinal magnetic field,\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nX X\n\uf8ed\n(14)\nJk \u015di * \u015di+k \u2212 Hz \u015dzi \uf8f8 .\n\u01242 =\ni\n\nk=1,2\n\nThe longitudinal magnetic field Hz is taken as 0 and 0.1\nin this analysis. At Hz = 0, there is a C-IC change\nat J1 /J2 = \u22124.

(Color online) Rotational parameter Q dependence\nof the variational energy in the S = 1/2 Heisenberg chain \u01241 .\n\nground state for J1 /J2 > \u22124 is a difficult task. Recent\nstudy2 pointed out that the ground state for J1 /J2 >\n\u22124 is the Haldane-dimer phase, which is characterized\nby a generalized string order parameter, where ordinal\nspin-spin correlations behave incommensurately3 . This\nincommensurate behavior is also found in the VC phase\nfor non-zero magnetic fields1 .\nTo demonstrate our approach for the C-IC change, optimized pitch Q is calculated for this frustrated Hamiltonian \u01242 as shown in Fig. 5. In this figure there\nare three kinds of the reference data. First, the broken line is the result of the mean-field approximation,\nQ = arccos(\u2212J1 /4J2 ). Second, the solid line is the fitting\nline for the location of the maximum of the zero field spin\nstructure factor with the ED3 , where Q \u221d (J2 \u2212 1/4)0.29 .\nFinally, the filled circles are the result of the DMRG at\nMz = 0.05 in the VC phase1 . For Hz = 0, the pitch Q\napproaches \u03c0/2 with increasing J1 /J2 more rapidly than\nthat of the mean field approximation due to taking into\naccount the quantum fluctuation by growing m. On the\nother hand, the C-IC change point is completely converged at J1 /J2 = \u22124. We find the pitch in m = 3 is\ncomparable with the result from ED3 in J1/J2 \u2264 \u22122.5.\nAround the transition point, the pitch is well converged\nwith respect to m in this scale. The m dependence becomes gradually large with increasing J1 /J2 , where the\nfrustration due to J2 becomes also gradually large.\nFor Hz = 0.1, the pitch Q depicted by the open circle\nin Fig. 5 has a jump around J1 /J2 = \u22123.1, which is very\nclose the SDW3 \u2013VC phase transition point1 . Unfortunately, the pitch Q for small m fails to capture the SDW3\nand SDW2 states, where there are the Ferro\u2013SDW3 phase\ntransition at J1 /J2 \u223c \u22123.3 and the VC\u2013SDW2 phase\ntransition at J1 /J2 \u223c \u221221 . In the same meaning, the\ncharacterization of the ground state at Hz = 0 is difficult for our method at this stage. Nevertheless, a notable point is that the incommensurate pitch Q of the ICMPS for the VC phase in J1 /J2 > \u22123.1 shows reasonable\nagreement with the DMRG result. For J1 /J2 > \u22123.1, Q\nof the IC-MPS is nearly independent of Hz , which is also\nconsistent with the DMRG analysis1 .\n\n\f5\n0.5\n0.45\n0.4\n\nQ/\u03c0\n\n0.35\n0.3\nMF\nm = 1, Hz=0\nm = 2, Hz=0\nm = 3, Hz=0\n3\nED , Hz=0\nm = 3, Hz=0.1\n1\nDMRG , Hz=0.1\n\n0.25\n0.2\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n-4.5\n\n-4\n\n-3.5\n\n-3\n\n-2.5\n\n-2\n\n-1.5\n\n-1\n\nJ1/J2\nFIG. 5. (Color online) Rotational parameter Q as a function\nof J1 /J2 in the zigzag chain \u01242 .\n\nV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn summary, we introduced the IRF-type MPS with\nthe incommensurate pitch parameter Q and the rotational axis n as a generalization of the uniform MPS,\nwhich can be used for various variational methods based\non the MPS. Two parameters Q and n allow us to evaluate an incommensurability of the spin chain in the thermodynamic limit directly. Our approach with small dimension of matrices is connected to the classical vector\nspin Heisenberg model which is valid in the large spin\nlimit (S \u226b 1). For the exact ground state, the helical\nmagnetic order obtained in the classical limit is expected\nto be destroyed by quantum fluctuations in the quantum\nlimit S = 1/2. However, we emphasize quantum effects\non some quantities are rapidly converged with respect\nto the matrix dimension. Our approach opens a way\nto a light-weight analysis based on the classical vector\nspin model to include quantum fluctuation. Using this\napproach, one can treat translational symmetry broken\nstates, such as the helical magnetic order, in the thermodynamic limit, which cannot be handled by known iMPS\nwith translational symmetry.\nWe demonstrated the efficiency of this IRF-type ICMPS in two types of Hamiltonians: i) the magnetization\nin the S = 1/2 antiferro-magnetic Heisenberg chain under uniform magnetic field, and ii) the C-IC change in\nS = 1/2 F-AF Heisenberg zigzag chain under uniform\nmagnetic field. In the former Hamiltonian, we have succeeded in obtaining the same result as two-site modulated\nMPS. This means 50% reduction of the number of optimization parameters. In the latter Hamiltonian, we have\nsucceeded in detection of the C-IC change of correlation\nproperties with increasing m. The pitch Q near the C-IC\ntransition point is immediately converged with respect to\nm and shows reasonable agreement with the ED study3\nand the DMRG study1 , despite small m.\nOn the other hand, the sufficiently converged Q is not\nobtained around the strongly frustrated region, namely\n|J1 | \u223c J2 . To discuss the details of Q, analysis with\nlarger m are necessary. For this problem, we can ap-\n\nply other optimization methods using the Trotter decomposition12 , the matrix product operator (MPO)37 ,\nand the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP)38\nto updating the MPS under given Qi and ni . We stress\nagain that the framework of IC-MPS is independent of\nthe type of numerical optimization process. In this paper, the modified Powell method was chosen as an optimization method because it is a general purpose method\nand all parameters are optimized easily. The modified\nPowell method is enough to clarify to effectiveness of our\nlight-weight modification but becomes a bottleneck when\nwe increase m. To study larger m, convergence properties and numerical efficiencies of these updating methods\nshould be discussed. This is one of future problems.\nAnother future issue is to change the constraint of the\nrotational axis and pitch parameter in order to represent\nthe magnetization plateau state or the SDW state, for\nexample ni = nmod[i,p] and Qi = Qmod[i,p] . As another\napplication, we have already performed other C-IC correlation properties change in the bilinear-biquadratic spin\nS = 1 chain39 , and succeeded to detect the C-IC change\nwith the IC-MPS, which cannot be detected by the mean\nfiled approximation.\nThis method uses the spin-rotational operator which\nmaps the classical helical state to the perfect-ferro state.\nThe uniform direct product state including the perfectferro state can be always described by the uniform MPS\nwith m = 1. A generalization of this method is to find\nanother kind of spin-rotational operator which maps the\nground state to the uniform direct product state. The\nrole of this operation is similar to disentanglers in the\nMERA26 . In this sense, it is interesting to consider the\nvalence bond solid (VBS) state which cannot be rotated\nby the spin-rotational operators15 and is known to have\nthe Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformation which converts\nthe string order to the ferromagnetic order as a global\ntopological disentangler40,41 .\nIn general, the classical magnetic order can be appeared easily in higher-dimensional systems. In this case,\nthe spin rotation becomes effective. Moreover, in higherdimensional systems, the dimension of the matrix/tensor\nis restricted due to the computational resources. Then, a\nsmall m analysis based on our approach is an interesting\napproach for the incommensurate TPS for 2D quantum\nspin systems, which is one of future issues. Not only for\nthe TPS, our approach can be applied to various methods.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe acknowledge discussions with S. Miyahara.
