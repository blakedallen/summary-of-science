The majority of the known HMXBs (\u223c80%) are Be/X-ray binaries consisting of a\nneutron star orbiting around a Be star; the compact object is characterized by an eccentric\norbit, spending most of its time far away from the disk surrounding the Be star. During the\ntime of the neutron star's periastron passage, the compact object accretes from the dense\nequatorial Be star disk producing bright outbursts lasting for several weeks or even months.\nThe other major group of HMXBs consists of a compact object orbiting around a supergiant\nearly-type star (OB) and in this case the X-ray emission is powered by accretion of material\noriginating from the donor star through a strong stellar wind and/or Roche-lobe overflow.\nStars in the supergiant phase have a very short lifetime; due to the evolutionary timescales\ninvolved supergiant HMXBs (SGXBs) are expected to be much less numerous than Be/X\nray binaries. To date about a dozen of them have been detected in the classical X-ray band.\nINTEGRAL is changing this picture since its observations are indicating the presence\nof a new subclass of SGXBs which have been labelled as supergiant fast X-ray transients\n(SFXTs) (Negueruela et al. 2005a). Most of the time they are undetectable, then occasionally they undergo fast X-ray transient activity lasting less than a day, typically a few hours\n(Sguera et al. 2005). Their outbursts show complex structures characterized by several fast\nflares with both rise and decay times of less than 1 hour (typically a few tens of minutes).\nThis kind of X-ray transient activity is very different from that seen in other high mass X-ray\nbinaries (i.e. Be/X-ray transients). Moreover, SFXTs differ from classical SGXBs since the\nlatter are known to be persistent bright sources with X-ray luminosities always detectable\nin the range 1035 \u20131036 erg s\u22121 while, on the contrary, SFXTs present quiescence luminosities\nwith values or upper limits in the range 1032 \u20131033 erg s\u22121 (Negueruela et al. 2005a). The\nphysical origin of the fast outbursts displayed by SFXTs is still unknown. Their very short\nduration is not compatible with viscous timescales in a typical accretion disc; therefore fast\nX-ray outbursts from SFXTs must be due to a completely different mechanism. in't Zand\n(2005) has suggested that the origin must be related to the early-type donor star and in\nparticular to the wind accretion mass transfer mode from the supergiant to the compact\nobject. It could be that the supergiant ejects material in a non-continuous way. In fact,\nmany early-type stars are characterized by highly structured and variable massive winds\n(Prinja et al. 2005) which could have a fundamentally clumpy nature. The capture of these\nclumps by a nearby compact object could then produce fast X-ray flares thereby explaining\nthe observed timescales.\nSFXTs are difficult to detect because of their very transitory nature; to date the list\nconsists of 5 objects. However there are a few more unidentified X-ray sources which display\nfast X-ray outbursts and are therefore candidate SFXTs even if their optical counterpart has\nnot yet been identified with an early-type supergiant (Negueruela et al. 2005a).\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nThe IBIS/ISGRI instrument (Ubertini et al. 2003, Lebrun et al. 2003) on board the\nINTEGRAL satellite (Winkler et al. 2003) is particularly suited to the detection of new\nor already known supergiant fast X-ray transient sources since it provides a very powerful\ncombination of a large FOV, good sensitivity and wide energy range. All are indispensable\ncharacteristics for the detection of fast transient events such as SFXTs.\nIn this paper, we report in section 3 on IBIS detections of newly discovered fast X-ray\noutbursts from 3 known SFXTs (XTE J1739\u2212302, IGR J18410\u22120535=AX J1841.0\u22120536,\nIGR J17544\u22122619). Moreover, we unveil for the first time the fast X-ray transient nature\nof IGR J11215\u22125952 which has been recently identified as a supergiant HMXB (Masetti\net al. 2005). Furthermore, we report in section 4 on new IBIS discoveries of fast X-ray\noutbursts from 6 more sources (IGR J16479\u22124514, IGR J16418\u22124532, AX J1749.1\u22122733,\nIGR J16195\u22124945=AX J161929\u22124945, XTE J1743\u2212363, IGR J17407\u22122808). All of them\nare still unidentified, but they can be considered as candidate SFXTs since their characteristics strongly resemble those of the known SFXTs.\n\n2.\n\nINTEGRAL data analysis\n\nThe data are collected with the low-energy array, ISGRI (INTEGRAL Soft GammaRay Imager; Lebrun et al. 2003), consisting of a pixilated 128\u00d7128 CdTe solid-state detector\nthat views the sky through a coded aperture mask. The reduction and analysis of the ISGRI\ndata have been performed by using the INTEGRAL Offline Scientific Analysis (OSA) v.4.2\navailable to the public through the INTEGRAL Science Data Centre ISDC (Courvoisier et al.\n2003). INTEGRAL observations are typically divided into short pointings (Science Window,\nScW) of \u223c 2000 s duration. Our ScW dataset belongs to the Core Program data collected as\npart of the Galactic Plane Survey (GPS) and the Galactic Centre Deep Exposure (GCDE)\n(Winkler et al. 2003) from revolution 45 (end of February 2003) to 307 (April 2005) as well\nas to all public data released up to revolution 160.\nThe set of observations used for our analysis, although being highly inhomogeneous in\nboth extent and exposure, covers \u223c65% of the sky at a level of at least 10 ksec, as can\nbe seen from the exposure map shown in Figure 1. The Galactic Plane, and in particular\nthe Galactic Center, are particularly well covered with exposure times of at least 100 and\n1000 ksec respectively. It is not surprising that most of the SFXTs so far discovered by\nINTEGRAL are located in the proximity of the Galactic Centre, a region that has been\nextensively monitored.\n\n\f0.000\n\n30.000\n\n60.000\n\n90.000\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n225.000\n\n270.000\n\n315.000\n\n0.000\n\n45.000\n\n90.000\n\n135.000\n\n180.000\n\n-90.000\n\n-60.000\n\n180.000\n\nFig. 1.- The exposure map for our dataset. Contour levels are at 10, 100, 1000 ksec.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n\nFig. 2.- The number of ScWs versus Galactic latitude of their pointing.\nFigure 2 displays the angular distribution off the Galactic plane of the central pointing\ndirection of all (\u223c 11300) ScWs in our dataset. Their strong concentration (\u223c70%, 7900\nScWs) towards the Galactic plane (|b|\u2264 5\u25e6 ) rather than medium or high galactic latitude is\nclearly evident. SFXTs are expected to be mainly located on the Galactic plane due to the\nvery young ages of their progenitor stars.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nEach ScW of our dataset has been analysed using the imaging components of the\nOSA4.2. A proprietary tool was used to search each ScW, and provide a cross-correlated list\nof all excesses above 5\u03c3 found in one or more ScWs. The search was initially performed in\nthe energy band 20\u201330 keV; but when a source was found then we also checked the detection\nat higher energies and in the previous and subsequent ScWs. This approach is efficient in\nunveiling very fast transient events lasting only a few hours since the search occurs on the\nsame timescale as the outbursts themselves. Integrating for longer just degrades the signalto-noise of the detection. The resulting excesses were then inspected visually to ensure an\nappropriate point spread function and so to identify them as real sources. This was necessary\nin order to reject false detections such as ghosts, structures or background noise. For each\nnewly discovered fast outburst a more detailed timing and spectral analysis was performed\nusing the OSA v.4.2.\nThe sensitivity limit for a persistent source detected at 5\u03c3 level (20\u201330 keV) in only\none ScW of \u223c 2000 s is \u223c 25 mCrab. In the case of an outburst visible in more than one\nconsecutive ScW, we can assume our detection limit is again \u223c 25 mCrab, but now refers to\nthe average flux of the outburst during the ScW containing the peak. Note that we do not\nplace any requirements on detection during multiple ScWs.\nDue to possible cross-talk between objects in the same FOV, we have also investigated\nthe variability pattern of all other bright sources in the FOV, as well as the source of interest.\nThey have shown a different time variability enabling us to conclude that the light curves\nobtained for the sources of interest are reliable. Images from the X-ray Monitor JEM-X\n(Lund et al. 2003) were created for all newly discovered outbursts reported in this paper. In\nmost cases, the source was outside or on the edge of the JEM-X field of view; no significant\ndetection were obtained for those inside the FOV so we did not take into account JEM-X\ndata for our analysis.\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nFirm Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients\nXTE J1739\u2212302=IGR J17391\u22123021\n\n3.1.1. Archival X-ray observations of the source\nXTE J1739\u2212302=IGR J17391\u22123021 is a well studied SFXT (Smith et al. 2005). Since\nits discovery in August 1997 by RXTE (Smith et al. 1998), the source has been detected\nin outburst by ASCA in 1999 (Sakano et al. 2002) and by INTEGRAL in 2003 and 2004\n(Sguera et al. 2005, Lutovinov et al. 2005). All previous reported outbursts are characterized\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nby durations ranging from \u223c 2 hours to \u223c half a day. Sguera et al. (2005) showed several\ndetailed ISGRI lightcurves of the source in outburst which clearly display complex structures\nwith quick flares reaching their peak flux over very short timescales (a few tens of minutes)\nand then dropping off with the same timescale as the rise time. To date, no pulsations have\nbeen reported from any of the outbursts detected by the previously cited X-ray missions.\nNegueruela et al. (2005b) identified the optical counterpart as an O8Iab(f) supergiant\nat a distance of \u223c 2.3 kpc. In the optical and infrared, XTE J1739\u2212302 is very similar to\nthe supergiant HMXB systems.\n\n3.1.2. Analysis of IBIS/ISGRI observations and results\nTable 1 contains a list of all IBIS detections of outbursts from XTE J1739\u2212302. Here we\nreport on a newly discovered fast X-ray outburst of XTE J1739\u2212302 detected on 21 August\n2004 (No. 6 in Table 1). Here, and in the subsequent analysis, we assume the beginning of\nthe first ScW during which the source was detected as being the start time of the outburst\nand similarly the burst stop time to be the end of the last ScW during which the source was\ndetected.\nThe source turned on at 05:25:12 UTC an showed abrupt outburst activity lasting \u223c 3\nhours, then it turned off at 08:38:03 UTC. As we can see from the 20\u201360 keV ISGRI light\ncurve shown in Figure 3, the fast X-ray transient activity is quite complex. It is characterized\nby several sharp flares which reach their peak on very short timescale and then drop with a\nsimilar timescale. This kind of transient behaviour has already been noted in several other\noutbursts of XTE J1739\u2212302 detected by IBIS (Sguera et al. 2005). A Fourier analysis of the\nlightcurve in Figure 3 did not show any significant evidence of pulsations; however we note\nthat the peaks are approximately separated by \u223c 2000 s; another outburst detected by IBIS\non March 2003 also displayed this kind of characteristic (Sguera et al. 2005). Unfortunately\nin both cases the duration of the outburst is only a few times the putative period of 2000 s,\nso the detection of a longer outburst is needed to confirm any such periodicity in the light\ncurve of XTE J1739\u2212302. To date this is the strongest outburst detected by IBIS from\nXTE J1739\u2212302. The peak-flux and luminosity (20\u201360 keV) of the strongest flare in Figure\n3 are \u223c 480 mCrab and \u223c3.5\u00d71036 erg s\u22121 , respectively. The lowest limit for the quiescence\nluminosity (2\u201310 keV) of XTE J1739\u2212302 is 7\u00d71032 erg s\u22121 (Sakano et al. 2002, Smith et\nal. 2005), obtained from the same observation during which the source underwent a strong\noutburst.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n\nFig. 3.- The ISGRI light curve (20\u201360 keV) of a newly discovered outburst of\nXTE J1739\u2212302=IGR J17391\u22123021\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n\nTable\n1:\nSummary\nof\nISGRI\nobservations\nof\noutbursts\nXTE J1739\u2212302=IGR J17391\u22123021.\nNo. Date\nduration (hours)\nflux at the peak\nref\n1\n22 March 2003\n\u223c2\n\u223c 250 mCrab (20\u201330 keV) [1]\n2\n26 August 2003\n\u223c 14\n\u223c 120 mCrab (18\u201360 keV) [2]\n3\n6 September 2003\n\u223c7\n\u223c 60 mCrab (18\u201360 keV) [2]\n4\n9 March 2004\n\u223c 0.5\n\u223c 150 mCrab (20\u201330 keV) [1]\n5\n10 March 2004\n\u223c 1.5\n\u223c 250 mCrab (20\u201330 keV) [1]\n6\n21 August 2004\n\u223c3\n\u223c 480 mCrab (20\u201360 keV) \u22c6\n[1] Sguera et al. 2005 [2] Lutovinov et al. 2005\n\u22c6 = this paper\n\nof\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n3.2.\n\nIGR J17544\u22122619\n\n3.2.1. Archival X-ray observations of the source\nIGR J17544\u22122619 is a fast X-ray transient source discovered with INTEGRAL on 17\nSeptember 2003 at UTC 01h10 (Sunyaev et al. 2003), when the source was bright for \u223c 2\nhours and then faded below the detection threshold. About 5 hours later the source turned\non again (Grebenev et al. 2003) and underwent another fast outburst which lasted \u223c 8 hours\nand was characterized by 2 peaks having flux values of \u223c 60 and \u223c 80 mCrab , respectively\n(25\u201350 keV). INTEGRAL again detected the source in outburst on 8 March 2004 (Grebenev\net al. 2004); the duration was \u223c 10 hours.\nSubsequent to the INTEGRAL discovery of the source, in't Zand et al. (2004) analyzed\nthe BeppoSAX WFC data archive revealing that IGR J17544\u22122619 was already detected in\noutburst five times from 1996 to 2000. The durations vary between 10 minutes and 8 hours\nwhile the peak fluxes were measured to be between 100 and 200 mCrab (2\u201328 keV).\nThree XMM observations of IGR J17544\u22122619 (Gonzalez-Riestra et al. 2004) showed\nthat its flux varies strongly on very short timescales (few minutes). Furthermore they provide\nan upper limit to the flux in quiescence of F0.5\u221210 keV \u2264 5\u00d710\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 while the flux\nin outburst was 7.5\u00d710\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 . Chandra observed the source both in quiescence\nand outburst on 3 July 2004 (in't Zand 2005), the luminosity (0.5\u201310 keV) in quiescence is\n\u223c 5\u00d71032 erg s\u22121 while the spectrum during the outburst is hard and moderately absorbed.\nin't Zand (2005) suggests that the accretor is a neutron star.\nThe optical counterpart of IGR J17544\u22122619 has been identified thanks to the XMM\nand Chandra accurate positions as a blue O9Ib supergiant located at \u223c 3 kpc (Pellizza et\nal. 2006, quoted in in't Zand 2005 and Negueruela et al. 2005a).\n\n3.2.2. Analysis of IBIS/ISGRI observations and results\nTable 2 lists all IBIS detections of outbursts from IGR J17544\u22122619. Here we present\n2 newly discovered fast X-ray outbursts (No. 4 and 5 in Table 2); moreover we show for the\nfirst time detailed ISGRI light curves of two fast X-ray outbursts (No. 1 and 3 in Table 2)\npreviously reported in the literature but not studied in detail.\nFigure 4 shows the ISGRI light curve (20\u201340 keV) of the outburst which occurred on\n17 September 2003 at UTC 01h10. The fast transient nature of the source is clearly evident\nwith two strong flares characterized by a very quick rise and decay (few tens of minutes).\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nThe peak-flux and the luminosity (20\u201340 keV) are \u223c 400 mCrab and \u223c 3.2\u00d71036 erg s\u22121\nrespectively.\nFigure 5 shows the ISGRI light curve (20\u201360 keV) of the outburst which occurred on 8\nMarch 2004. Initially it is characterized by several very quick flares (few minutes timescales),\nthen suddenly the source flares up in \u223c10 minutes to a 20\u201360 keV peak-flux of \u223c 240 mCrab.\nSubsequently the flux drops to a low level in \u223c 20 minutes. We extracted a spectrum of this\nstrong flare (20\u201360 keV) which is best fitted by a thermal bremsstrahlung model (kT=9.5\u00b10.9\nkeV, \u03c72\u03bd =1.24, d.o.f. 14). However a reasonable fit is also provided by a black body model\n(kT=4.4\u00b10.25 keV, \u03c72\u03bd =1.4, d.o.f. 14).\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n\nTable 2: Summary of ISGRI observations of outbursts of IGR J17544\u22122619\nNo.\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\nDate\n17 September 2003 01h10 UTC\n17 September 2003 06h UTC\n8 March 2004\n21 September 2004\n12 March 2005\n\nduration (hours)\n\u223c2\n\u223c8\n\u223c 10\n-\n\u223c 0.5\n\nflux at the peak\n\u223c 400 mCrab (20\u201340 keV)\n\u223c 80 mCrab (25\u201350 keV)\n\u223c 240 mCrab (20\u201360 keV)\n\u223c 70 mCrab (20\u201340 keV)\n\u223c 150 mCrab (20\u201330 keV)\n\n[1] Sunyaev et al. 2003 [2] Grebenev et al. 2003 [3] Grebenev et al. 2004\n\u22c6 = this paper\n\nref\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n\u22c6\n\u22c6\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- The ISGRI light curve (20\u201340 keV) of the IBIS detection of IGR J17544\u22122619 on\n17 September 2003 at UTC 01h10.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n\nFig. 5.- The ISGRI light curve (20\u201360 keV) of the IBIS detection of IGR J17544\u22122619 on\n8 March 2004.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nAs for the two newly discovered fast X-ray outbursts, the first occurred on 21 September\n2004 and its 20\u201340 keV light curve is shown in Figure 6. Unfortunately the light curve is\ntruncated at the beginning because the source was outside the IBIS field of view, so we do\nnot constrain the duration of the outburst. The peak-flux (20\u201340 keV) was \u223c70 mCrab.\nThe second outburst occurred on 12 March 2005 and it was detected in only one ScW.\nAs we can see from the 20\u201330 keV ISGRI light curve (Figure 7), the data are of poorer\nquality and don not allow any fast variability to be seen. The duration and the peak-flux\nwere \u223c 30 minutes and \u223c 150 mCrab (20\u201330 keV) respectively. Although the source was\ndetected in only one ScW, we have extracted a spectrum during the flare. The best fit model\n(20\u201340 keV) is provided by a black body (kT=2.9\u00b10.4 keV, \u03c72\u03bd =1.007, d.o.f. 8) (see Figure\n8). However, even an optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung model provides a reasonable fit\n(kT=5\u00b11 keV, \u03c72\u03bd =0.8, d.o.f. 8); this type of spectrum in the hard X-ray band is typical of\nbinary systems with neutron stars.\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\n\nFig. 6.- The ISGRI light curve (20\u201340 keV) of a newly discovered outburst of\nIGR J17544\u22122619 detected on 21 September 2004.\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\n\nFig.\n7.- the ISGRI light curve (20\u201330 keV) of a newly discovered outburst of\nIGR J17544\u22122619 detected on 12 March 2005.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n\nFig. 8.- The unfolded black body spectrum (20\u201340 keV) of IGR J17544\u22122619 during the\noutburst that occurred on 12 March 2005.\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\n3.3.\n\nIGR J18410\u22120535=AX J1841.0\u22120536\n\n3.3.1. Archival X-ray observations of the source\nIGR J18410\u22120535 was discovered during a GCDE on 8 October 2004 as it was undergoing an outburst detected between 20\u201360 keV (Rodriguez et al. 2004). The nominal position\nof IGR J18410\u22120535 is in agreement with the Chandra location (Halpern & Gotthelf 2004)\nof the ASCA 4.74 s transient pulsar AX J1841.0\u22120536 (Bamba et al. 2001), indicating that\nthey are the same object. AX J1841.0\u22120536 was detected by ASCA as a fast X-ray transient source in April 1994 and October 1999, in both cases a noticeable feature was multiple\nflares with a fast rise time of a few hours. The accurate Chandra position permitted the\nidentification of the optical counterpart of AX J1841.0\u22120536 with a luminous supergiant\nstar (Negueruela et al. 2005a), while the spectrum is well fitted with an absorbed power law\n(\u0393=1.35, NH =6\u00d71022 cm\u22122 ) (Halpern et al. 2004).\n\n3.3.2. Analysis of IBIS/ISGRI observations and results\nTable 3 lists all IBIS detections of fast X-ray outbursts from IGR J18410\u22120535. Here\nwe present 2 newly discovered fast X-ray outbursts (Nos. 1 and 2 in Table 3).\nThe first outburst occurred on 24 April 2003 and was detected in the energy band 20\u201380\nkeV for \u223c 7 hours. As we can note in Figure 9, the light curve shows a gradual increase,\nthen suddenly the source flares up to a peak very quickly (\u223c 20 minutes) and subsequently\nit drops off with a similar timescale as the rise. The peak-flux is \u223c 120 mCrab (20\u201380 keV).\nA spectrum extracted during the outburst is best fitted by a black body model (kT=8\u00b10.9\nkeV, \u03c72\u03bd =1.1, d.o.f. 19).\nA second, shorter, outburst (\u223c 1.1 hours) occurred on 6 May 2003. Figure 10 shows\nits 20\u201380 keV ISGRI light curve. Initially the flux is consistent with zero, then suddenly\nthe source turns on, flares up and quickly reaches a peak (rise time \u223c 13 minutes). The\n20\u201380 keV peak-flux is equal to \u223c 120 mCrab. The flux then drops to a low level in \u223c 30\nminutes, subsequently undergoing a small flare after which it turned off. We extracted a\nspectrum during this outburst, the best fit (20\u201380 keV) is provided by a black body model\n(kT=9\u00b10.9 keV, \u03c72\u03bd =1.45, d.o.f. 19). It is worth noting that both outbursts are very hard\nand are detected up to 80 keV. To date IGR J18410\u22120535=AX J1841.0\u22120536 is the only\nSFXT to show a hard energy tail.

Archival X-ray observations of the source\nThis transient source was discovered on 22 April 2005 at 06:04:25 UTC during the\ndecaying phase of an outburst (Lubinski et al. 2005). The reported 20\u201360 keV flux was 75\nmCrab declining to 44 mCrab in 40 minutes. To date this is the only outburst to be reported\nin literature.\n\u2032\u2032\n\nThe B1Ia-type supergiant HD 306414 (Vijapurkar & Drilling 1993), located 16 from\nthe nominal position of the source (Negueruela et al. 2005c), is the brightest optical object\nin the 3\u2032 ISGRI error circle. Based on its photometric properties, Negueruela et al. (2005c)\nsuggested that HD 306414 is the optical counterpart of IGR J11215\u22125952. Masetti et al.\n(2005) performed an optical follow-up observation of HD 306414 and the spectrum indicates\nthat it is an early B-type luminous star in agreement with the B1Ia spectral type classification\nof Vijapurkar & Drilling (1993). Its distance (\u223c 6.2 kpc) is compatible with a location in\nthe far end of the Carina Arm.\n\n3.4.2. Analysis of IBIS/ISGRI observations and results\nWe report on a newly discovered fast X-ray outburst of IGR J11215\u22125952.\nThe source displayed fast X-ray transient activity on 4 July 2003. Figure 11 shows its\nISGRI light curve; the peak-flux and luminosity (20\u201340 keV) are \u223c 40 mCrab and \u223c 1.4\u00d71036\nerg s\u22121 , the latter is in good agreement with typical outburst luminosities of SFXTs. The\nspectrum during the outburst activity can be reasonably described (\u03c72\u03bd =0.9, d.o.f. 14) by\nan optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung model (kT=19+5\n\u22123.5 keV). However, a reasonable fit\nwas also achieved using a black body model (kT=6.2\u00b10.6 keV, \u03c72\u03bd =1.4, d.o.f. 14).\nOur ISGRI analysis of this outburst provided a position at RA=11h 21m 50.16s DEC=\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\n59 52 04.8 (J2000) with an error radius of 2.2 , which is smaller than that reported when\n\u2032\nthe source was discovered (\u223c 3 , Lubinski et al. 2005). Obviously, a more refined position is\nneeded in order to confirm the association between IGR J11215\u22125952 and HD 306414.\n\u25e6\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\n\nFig. 11.- The ISGRI light curve (20\u201340 keV) of a newly discovered outburst of\nIGR J11215\u22125952.\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\n4.\n\nPossible candidate supergiant fast X-ray transients\n4.1.\n\nIGR J17407\u22122808\n\nIGR J17407\u22122808 was discovered on 9 October 2004 (Kretschmar et al. 2004) as it\nwas undergoing strong X-ray outburst activity characterized by several flares detected in\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nthe 20\u201360 keV band. The nominal position is (J2000) RA=17h 40m 42s DEC=-28\u25e6 08 00\n\u2032\nwith an error circle of 2.3 radius. The most energetic flare was strong enough to trigger\nan automatic alert message of the INTEGRAL Burst Alert System IBAS (Mereghetti et\n\u2032\u2032\nal. 2003) but the position consistency with the X-ray source SBM2001 10 (50 angular\nseparation between them) and soft spectrum (Gotz et al. 2004) excluded a gamma-ray burst\norigin for IGR J17407\u22122808.\nSBM2001 10 is a faint unidentified X-ray source listed in the ROSAT catalog of sources\nin the Galactic Center region (Sidoli et al. 2001). Its position is (J2000) RA=17h 40m 41.2s\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nDEC=-28\u25e6 08 50 (error circle of 16 radius) while the count rate is equal to 3.73\u00b11.2 cts\nksec\u22121 (0.1\u20132.4 keV).\nWe extracted a 20\u201360 keV ISGRI light curve (bin time of 25 seconds) from this detection\n(Figure 12). Three prominent very fast flares, lasting no more than few minutes, are clearly\nvisible. In particular the last flare is very strong, reaching a peak-flux of \u223c 805 mCrab\nor 9.5\u00d710\u22129 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 (20\u201360 keV). The rise and decay times are \u223c 50 s and \u223c25 s\nrespectively.\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\n\nFig. 12.- The ISGRI light curve (20\u201360 keV) of the detection of IGR J17407\u22122808 on 9\nOctober 2004.\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\nWe used a Good Time Interval (GTI) analysis to extract the spectrum of IGR J17407\u22122808\nduring this fast and strong flare lasting \u223c 1 minute. The 20\u201360 keV spectrum is best fitted\n2\nwith a thermal bremsstrahlung model (kT=23+7\n\u22124.5 keV, \u03c7\u03bd =0.78, d.o.f. 14); however a black\nbody model also gives a reasonable fit (kT=7\u00b10.7 keV, \u03c72\u03bd =1.3, d.o.f. 14).\nOur IBIS analysis of this flare provided a more accurate source position (J2000, RA=17h\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n40m 40.08s DEC=-28\u25e6 08 24 , error radius of 1.7 ) which is located 30 from the ROSAT\nsource SBM2001 10. Even if the ROSAT error circle is quite small (16\u2032\u2032 radius), it could\nnot be sufficiently small so as to allow an optical follow-up observation which is necessary to\nprovide unambigous identification.\nIt is worth noting that IGR J17407\u22122808 seems to be a very peculiar fast X-ray transient\nsource. It was detected only once by IBIS, and its outburst activity was characterized by 3\nvery quick and strong flares (20\u201360 keV, peak-flux \u223c 800 mCrab) with timescales less than a\ncouple of minutes. This makes the outburst activity of IGR J17407\u22122808 significantly shorter\nthan typical flaring activity from SFXTs which lasts at least a few hours. We cannot rule\nout the possibility that this outburst is not from a supergiant HMXB. Its timing behaviour\nresembles the so called burst-only sources detected by the WFCs on board BeppoSAX up\nto 30 keV (Cornelisse et al. 2004), although IGR J17407\u22122808 was detected by IBIS up to\n60 keV.\n\n4.2.\n\nIGR J16418\u22124532\n\nTomsick et al. (2004) reported the discovery of IGR J16418\u22124532 during an INTEGRAL observation targeted to the black hole X-ray transient 4U 1630-47 and performed\nbetween 1\u20135 February 2003. The 20\u201340 keV flux was 3\u00d710\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 . To date this is\nthe only outburst to be reported from this source.\nWe report on a newly discovered fast X-ray outburst of IGR J16418\u22124532 which unveils\nfor the first time its likely fast X-ray transient nature. It was detected by IBIS in only 2\nconsecutive ScWs (20\u201330 keV) on 26 February 2004 (duration of \u223c 1 hour). Figure 13 shows\nthe 20\u201330 keV ISGRI light curve, while the peak-flux was \u223c 80 mCrab.\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\n\nFig. 13.- The ISGRI light curve (20\u201330 keV) of a newly discovered outburst of\nIGR J16418\u22124532.\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\n4.3.\n\nIGR J16479\u22124514\n\n4.3.1. Archival X-ray observations of the source\nIGR J16479\u22124514 was discovered with IBIS during observations of the Galactic Center\nregion performed on 8\u20139 August 2003 (Molkov et al. 2003). The average fluxes were 12\nmCrab and 8 mCrab in the energy bands 18\u201325 keV and 25\u201350 keV, respectively. During\nobservations performed on August 10, the source showed outburst activity where the flux\nincreased by a factor \u223c2 in the same energy bands (Molkov et al. 2003). These outbursts\nwere reported as an average detection, hence the fast X-ray transient nature of the source\nwas not reported. We have performed an analysis at the ScW level and we show for the first\ntime the ISGRI light curve of the source on 10 August 2003, where the fast X-ray transient\nbehaviour is clearly evident (Figure 14). The duration of the outburst was \u223c 3.5 hours with\na 20\u201330 keV peak-flux of \u223c 150 mCrab. This kind of fast transient behaviour is confirmed\nby the detections of 4 more fast X-ray outbursts from IGR J16479\u22124514 reported by Sguera\net al. (2005). The durations vary from \u223c 30 minutes to \u223c 3 hours; in particular the shortest\noutburst was also the most energetic, reaching a 20\u201330 keV peak-flux of 850 mCrab (Sguera\net al. 2005). The energetic and temporal behavior of this outburst is reminiscent of a\ntype I X-ray burst, however this kind of explanation is inconclusive since the statistics are\ninsufficient to find evidence of any spectral softening (Sguera et al. 2005).\nLutovinov et al. (2005a) published a broad band energy spectrum of IGR J16479\u22124514\n(1\u2013100 keV) described by a simple power law model modified by a cutoff at high energies\nand photoabsorption at soft X-rays (NH =1.2\u00d71023 cm\u22122 ) exceeding the galactic value along\nthe line of sight. Based on these spectral characteristics, they suggested that it is a neutron\nstar binary system with a high mass companion.\nOn 30 August 2005, the Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT) detected flaring activity from\nIGR J16479\u22124514 (Kennea et al. 2005) consisting of 2 fast flares (15\u201350 keV). The spectrum\nof the source was fitted by an absorbed power law (\u0393=1.1) with a 0.5\u201310 keV flux of 3.8\u00d710\u221211\nerg cm\u22122 s\u22121 . The Swift XRT observation provided a very accurate source position (J2000,\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nRA=16h 48m 07s , DEC=-45\u25e6 12 05.8 ) with an error circle of 6 radius inside which the\n\u2032\nSwift optical telescope detected a faint object (J2000, RA=16h 48m 06.8s , DEC=-45\u25e6 12\n\u2032\u2032\n08 ) in the V band with a magnitude of 20.4\u00b10.4. This optical source is catalogued in the\nUSNO\u2013B1 catalog with I and R1 magnitudes of 16.7 and 18.36, respectively. It is the only\nUSNO\u2013B1 object inside the Swift error box, and an optical follow-up observation is necessary\nto unveil its nature.\n\n\f\u2013 30 \u2013\n\nFig. 14.- The ISGRI light curve (20\u201330 keV) of the detection of IGR J16479\u22124514 on 10\nAugust 2003.\n\n\f\u2013 31 \u2013\n\nTable 4: Summary of ISGRI observations of outbursts of IGR J16479\u22124514\nNo. Date\nduration (hours)\nflux at the peak\n1 5 March 2003\n\u223c 3.5\n\u223c 850 mCrab (20\u201330 keV)\n2 28 March 2003\n\u223c 1.5\n\u223c 40 mCrab\u2020\n3 21 April 2003\n\u223c 0.5\n\u223c 160 mCrab\u2020\n4 8\u201310 August 2003\n\u2013\n\u2013\n5 14 August 2003\n\u223c2\n\u223c 44 mCrab\u2020\n6 7 September 2004\n\u223c2\n\u223c 125 mCrab (20\u201360 keV)\n7 16 September 2004\n\u223c 2.5\n\u223c 120 mCrab (20\u201360 keV)\n8 4 April 2005\n\u223c 2.5\n\u223c 60 mCrab (20\u201360 keV)\n\nref\n[1]\n[1]\n[1]\n[2]\n[1]\n\u22c6\n\u22c6\n\u22c6\n\n[1] Sguera et al. 2005 [2] Molkov et al. 2003\n\u22c6 = this paper\n\u2020 = Average flux (20\u201330 keV) during the outburst\n4.3.2. Analysis of IBIS/ISGRI observations and results\nTable 4 lists all IBIS detections of outbursts from IGR J16479\u22124514. Here we report\non 3 newly discovered fast X-ray outbursts (Nos. 6, 7 and 8 in Table 4). .\nThe first occurred on 7 September 2004 (Figure 15) with a duration of \u223c 2.2 hours and\na peak-flux (20\u201360 keV) of \u223c 125 mCrab. It was characterized by 2 very quick flares, the\nfirst with both a fast rise and decay timescale (\u223c 10 minutes) while the second one has the\nsame fast rise but a slower exponential decay.\n\n\f\u2013 32 \u2013\n\nFig. 15.- The ISGRI light curve (20\u201360 keV) of a newly discovered outburst of\nIGR J16479\u22124514 on 7 September 2004.\n\n\f\u2013 33 \u2013\n\nFig. 16.- The ISGRI light curve (20\u201360 keV) of a newly discovered outburst of\nIGR J16479\u22124514 on 16 September 2004.\nThe second outburst was detected \u223c 9 days later on 16 September 2004 (Figure 16)\nand it is characterized by one single strong flare with similar timescales during the rise and\nthe decay. The duration and peak-flux are \u223c 2.5 hours and \u223c 120 mCrab (20\u201360 keV)\nrespectively. An ISGRI spectrum extracted during this outburst is equally well fitted (20\u201360\nkeV) by a black body model (kT=7.4\u00b10.5 keV, \u03c72\u03bd =0.95, d.o.f. 14) or by a simple power\nlaw (\u0393=2.6\u00b10.2, \u03c72\u03bd =1.06, d.o.f. 14).\n\n\f\u2013 34 \u2013\n\nFig. 17.- The ISGRI light curve (20\u201360 keV) of a newly discovered outburst of\nIGR J16479\u22124514 on 4 April 2005\nThe last outburst occurred on 4 April 2005 (Figure 17), with duration and peak-flux of\n\u223c 2.5 hours and \u223c 60 mCrab (20\u201360 keV) respectively.\nThe three newly discovered outbursts, together with those previously detected by INTEGRAL (Sguera et al. 2005), indicate a fast transient nature which strongly resembles that\nof known supergiant fast X-ray transients, therefore IGR J16479\u22124514 can be considered a\ncandidate.\n\n\f\u2013 35 \u2013\n4.4.\n\nXTE J1743\u2212363\n\nXTE J1743\u2212363 is a faint unidentified X-ray source discovered by RXTE in February\n1999 (Markwardt et al. 1999) with a flux ranging from 3 to 15 mCrab (2\u201310 keV); it showed\nvariability on \u223c 1 minute timescales. IBIS detected the source during an observation of the\nGalactic Center region performed on 18\u201320 September 2004, when it was strongly variable\nwith an average flux of 10 mCrab (18\u201345 keV) (Grebenev & Sunyaev 2004). A few days later\na VLA radio observation of XTE J1743\u2212363 did not detect any strong radio source within\n\u2032\nthe 2 ISGRI error circle either at 4.9 GHz or at 8.5 GHz (Rupen et al. 2004). Previously,\nduring a \u223c 2 million seconds exposure of the Galactic Center region (August\u2013September\n2003), XTE J1743\u2212363 was marginally detected at a flux level of 1.7\u00b10.2 mCrab (18\u201360\nkeV) (Revnitsev et al. 2004).\nWe report on a newly discovered outburst which unveils for the for time the fast transient\nbehaviour of XTE J1743\u2212363. It was detected on 5 October 2004 in the energy range 20\u201360\nkeV (Figure 18), with a duration and peak-flux of \u223c 2.5 hours and \u223c 40 mCrab (20\u201360 keV)\nrespectively. We extracted a spectrum of the source during the outburst activity (20\u201360\nkeV) for which a single power law gives a reasonably good fit (\u0393=2.9\u00b10.5, \u03c72\u03bd =1.28, d.o.f.\n14). A similar fit was also achieved using an optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung model\n2\n(kT=22+11\n\u22126 keV, \u03c7\u03bd =1.35, d.o.f. 14).\n\n\f\u2013 36 \u2013\n\nFig. 18.- The ISGRI light curve (20\u201360 keV) of a newly discovered outburst of\nXTE J1743\u2212363.\n\n\f\u2013 37 \u2013\n4.5.\n\nIGR J16195\u22124945=AX J161929\u22124945\n\nIGR J16195\u22124945 was discovered by INTEGRAL during Core Program observations\naccumulated between 27 February and 19 October 2003 (Walter et al. 2004). Subsequently,\nSidoli et al. (2005) reported the ASCA X-ray source AX J161929\u22124945 as its low energy\ncounterpart. An ASCA light curve (2\u201310 keV) of AX J161929\u22124945 (Sidoli et al. 2005)\nshows outburst activity which lasted only a few hours, the source was below the threshold\nof detectability at the beginning and at the end of the observation. Moreover, variability on\nvery short timescales is clearly evident with several short flares. The ASCA spectrum (1\u201310\nkeV) is fitted by an absorbed power law (\u0393 \u223c 0.6, NH \u223c1023 cm\u22122 ).\nAnalysing public INTEGRAL data, Sidoli et al. (2005) reported on IBIS detections of\nIGR J16195\u22124945=AX J161929\u22124945 in only 2 observations of \u223c 1.7 ksec each on 4 and\n14 March 2003. In both observations the average flux level was \u223c 17 mCrab (20\u201340 keV).\n\u2032\n\nThe brightest star in the ASCA error circle (1 radius) is HD 146628 (Sidoli et al.\n2005) classified as a supergiant of spectral type B1/B2Ia (distance \u223c 7 kpc) in the SIMBAD database. Follow-up observations at X-ray wavelengths are necessary so as to reduce the error box in order to establish if the supergiant star is really the counterpart of\nIGR J16195\u22124945=AX J161929\u22124945.\nWe report a newly discovered fast X-ray outburst that occurred on 26 September 2003.\nThe duration was \u223c 1.5 hours (Figure 19) and it reached a peak-flux of \u223c 35 mCrab (20\u201340\nkeV). If we assume HD 146628 to be the optical counterpart of the source, then the 20\u201340\nkeV luminosity is \u223c1.5\u00d71036 erg s\u22121 . We extracted a spectrum during the outburst activity.\nBoth black body and thermal bremsstrahlung models gave unsatisfactory fits (\u03c72\u03bd greater\nthan 1.8). The best fit model (\u03c72\u03bd =1.07, d.o.f. 12) is the sum of a black body (kT= 0.8+1.1\n\u22120.3\nkeV) with a power law (\u0393=2.78+1.2\n).\n\u22121.1\n\n\f\u2013 38 \u2013\n\nFig. 19.- The ISGRI light curve (20\u201340 keV) of a newly discovered outburst of\nIGR J16195\u22124945=AX J161929\u22124945.\n\n\f\u2013 39 \u2013\n4.6.\n\nAX J1749.1\u22122733\n\nAX J1749.1\u22122733 is an unidentified and poorly studied X-ray source discovered by\nASCA during its survey of the Galactic Center region performed between 1993 and 1999\n(Sakano et al. 2002). The region including this source was observed by ASCA on 6 occasions,\nhowever AX J1749.1\u22122733 was detected in only 3 of them (September 1996 and 1997, March\n1998).\nWe report on a newly discovered fast X-ray outburst of AX J1749.1\u22122733 which unveils\nfor the first time its fast transient nature. IBIS detected the source on 9 September 2003\nduring an outburst lasting \u223c 1.3 days (Figure 20), at a position (J2000, RA=17h 49m 07.2s\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nDEC=-27\u25e6 32 38.4 , error circle radius 1.8 ) which is located 42 from the ASCA position.\nThe 20\u201360 keV peak-flux is \u223c 40 mCrab. A spectrum of the source extracted during this\noutburst activity (20\u201360 keV) can only be reasonably described by the (\u03c72\u03bd =1.46, d.o.f.\n12) sum of a black body (kT=0.7+0.3\n\u22120.1 keV) with a power law (\u0393=2.5\u00b10.2). Other spectral\nmodels, such as thermal bremsstrahlung, simple power law, black body or Comptonized\nmodels, provided very poor fits with \u03c72\u03bd greater than 3.\n\n\f\u2013 40 \u2013\n\nFig. 20.- The ISGRI light curve (20\u201360 keV) of a newly discovered outburst of\nAX J1749.1\u22122733.\n\n\f\u2013 41 \u2013\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have reported on IBIS detections of newly discovered fast X-ray outbursts from 10\nsources. Four of them are SFXTs while the remaining six are candidate SFXTs. Tables\n5 and 6 provide a summary of all their known characteristics, listing Galactic coordinates,\ndistance and absorption when available, duration of the outbursts and their peak-flux, peakluminosity, temperature of the black body or bremsstrahlung best fit spectrum.\nXTE J1739\u2212302, IGR J17544\u22122619 and IGR J18410\u221205355=AX J1841.0\u22120536 are\nknown supergiant fast X-ray transients. The newly discovered fast X-ray outburst from\nXTE J1739\u2212302 has a peak-flux of \u223c480 mCrab (20\u201360 keV), so far it is the strongest\ndetected by IBIS. Newly discovered fast X-ray outbursts from IGR J18410\u22120535 have been\ndetected in the energy range 20\u201380 keV and to date IGR J18410\u22120535 is the only SFXT\nwhich had exhibited a hard tail up to 80 keV. In the case of IGR J11215\u22125952, Masetti\net al. (2005) recently reported evidence of a supergiant HMXB nature. We strengthen this\nassociation since we unveiled for the first time its fast X-ray transient nature.\nAs for the 6 unidentified X-ray sources reported in this paper, we have presented newly\ndiscovered fast outbursts which strongly resemble those of known SFXTs. Although the\noptical counterparts have not yet been identified, they are candidate SFXTs. In particular, IGR J16479\u22124514 is known to display fast X-ray outbursts which have been detected\nby IBIS (Sguera et al. 2005). Concerning the remaining 5 unidentified X-ray sources\n(AX J161929\u22124945, IGR J16418\u22124532, XTE J1743\u2212363, AX J1749.1\u22122733, IGR J17407\u22122808),\nwe reported their fast X-ray transient nature for the first time. Among them, IGR J17407\u22122808\nshowed a peculiar fast transient activity lasting only a few minutes and we cannot rule out\nthe possibility that its fast outburst is not from a supergiant HMXB. The timing behaviour\nresembles the so called burst-only sources detected by the WFCs on board BeppoSAX (Cornelisse et al. 2004). It is worth noting that 2 more sources have been reported in the\nliterature as candidate SFXTs, SAX J1818.6-1703 (Sguera et al. 2005, Grebenev & Sunyaev\n2005, Negueruela et al. 2005a) and XTE J1901+014 (Negueruela et al. 2005a).\nIn Figure 21 we show the angular distribution off the Galactic Plane of the 10 sources\nreported in this paper (filled black bars) and of all HMXBs (empty white bars) reported in\nthe 2nd IBIS/ISGRI gamma-ray catalog (Bird et al. 2006). As far as we can tell from the\nlimited statistics, the density of the 10 sources reported in our paper appears to be greater\ntowards the Galactic plane, with 9 of the 10 having |b|< 1.5\u25e6 . This is to be expected if they\nare supergiant HMXBs, due to the very young ages of their progenitor stars. If we assume\nthat INTEGRAL is observing the Galactic Plane randomly and combine the information\nprovided in section 2 (see Figure 2) with the number of SFXTs detected by IBIS/ISGRI,\nthen we estimate a rough rate of detection of SFXTs equal to \u223c 20 per year.\n\n\f\u2013 42 \u2013\n\nFig. 21.- The angular distribution off the Galactic Plane of the 10 sources reported in\nthis paper (filled black bars) and of all HMXBs (empty white bars) as taken from the 2nd\nIBIS/ISGRI gamma-ray catalog (Bird et al. 2006).\nAlthough SFXTs are difficult to detect, the number known is rapidly increasing thanks\nto INTEGRAL observations. Apart from the SFXTs mentioned in this paper, two more\nhave been reported in the literature; IGR J16465\u22124945 (Negueruela et al. 2005a) and\nAX J1845.0-0433 (Yamauchi et al. 1995, Negueruela et al. 2005a). On the contrary there\nare 8 candidate SFXTs and if just a few of them could be confirmed, then their number\nwould be already comparable to that of classical supergiant HMXBs. Moreover, the class\nof SFXTs could be much larger than the previous 14 cited objects. A population of still\nundetected supergiant fast X-ray transient sources could be hidden in our Galaxy. Ongoing\nobservations with INTEGRAL may yield further detections of such sources.\n\n\fTable 5: Summary of characteristics of the 4 supergiant fast X-ray transients\nSource\n\nl\n\nb\n\ndistance\nkpc\n\nNH\n\u00d71022 cm\u22122\n\nDate\n\nduration\nh\n\nflux at the peak\nmCrab\n\nLuminosity-peak\n\u00d71036 erg s\u22121\n\nXTE J1739\u2212302\n\n358.07\n\n0.45\n\n2.3\n\n3\u201338\n\n3.24\n\n-0.34\n\n3\n\n\u223c 3\n\n\u223c 2\n\u223c 14\n\u223c 7\n\u223c 0.5\n\u223c 1.5\n\u223c 3\n\u223c 2\n\u223c 8\n\u223c 10\n\u223c 0.5\n\u223c 7\n\u223c 1.1\n\n\u223c 250 (20\u201330 keV)\n\u223c 120 (18\u201360 keV)\n\u223c 60 (18\u201360 keV)\n\u223c 150 (20\u201330 keV)\n\u223c 250 (20\u201330 keV)\n\u223c 480 (20\u201360 keV)\n\u223c 400 (20\u201340 keV)\n\u223c 80 (25\u201350 keV)\n\u223c 240 (20\u201360 keV)\n\u223c 70 (20\u201340 keV)\n\u223c 150 (20\u201330 keV)\n\u223c 120 (20\u201380 keV)\n\u223c 120 (20\u201380 keV)\n\n0.7 (20\u201330 keV)\n\nIGR J17544\u22122619\n\n22/03/2003\n26/08/2003\n6/09/2003\n9/03/2004\n10/03/2004\n21/08/2004\n17/09/2003 01h\n17/09/2003 06h\n8/03/2004\n21/09/2004\n12/03/2005\n24/04/2003\n6/05/2003\n8/10/2004\n4/07/2003\n22/04/2005\n\n\u223c 3\n\n\u223c 40 (20\u201340 keV)\n\nIGR J18410\u22120535\n\n26.76\n\n-0.239\n\nIGR J11215\u22125952\n\n291.89\n\n1.07\n\n\u223c 6\n\n6.2\n\nkTBB\nkeV\n\nkTBR\nkeV\n\n4.4\u00b10.25\n\n9.5\u00b10.9\n\n2.9\u00b10.4\n8\u00b10.9\n9\u00b10.9\n\n5\u00b11\n\n6.2\u00b10.6\n\n19\u22123.5\n\n3.5 (20\u201360 keV)\n3.2 (20\u201340 keV)\n3 (20\u201360 keV)\n0.57 (20\u201340 keV)\n\n1.4 (20\u201340 keV)\n\n+5\n\nSource\n\nl\n\nb\n\nIGR J17407\u22122808\nIGR J16479\u22124514\n\n0.12\n340.14\n\n1.34\n-0.12\n\nIGR J16418\u22124532\n\n339.18\n\n0.5\n\nIGR J16195\u22124945\n\n333.54\n\n0.33\n\nXTE J1743\u2212363\nAX J1749.1\u22122733\n\n353.39\n1.585\n\n-3.4\n0.051\n\ndistance\nkpc\n\n\u2020 = Average flux (20\u201330 keV) during the outburst\n\u22c6 = Average flux (20\u201340 keV) during the outburst\n\nNH\n\u00d71022 cm\u22122\n\u223c 12\n\n\u223c 12\n\nDate\n\nduration\nh\n\nflux at the peak\nmCrab\n\n9/10/2004\n5/03/2003\n28/03/2003\n21/04/2003\n8\u201310/08/2003\n14/08/2003\n7/09/2004\n16/09/2004\n4/04/2005\n1\u20135/02/2003\n26/02/2004\n4/03/2003\n14/03/2003\n26/09/2003\n5/10/2004\n9/09/2003\n\n\u223c 3 minutes\n\u223c 3.5\n\u223c 1.5\n\u223c 0.5\n\n805 (20\u201360 keV)\n\u223c 850 (20\u201330 keV)\n\u223c 40\u2020\n\u223c 160\u2020\n\n\u223c 2\n\u223c2\n\u223c 2.5\n\u223c 2.5\n\n\u223c 44\u2020\n\u223c 125 (20\u201360 keV)\n\u223c 120 (20\u201360 keV)\n\u223c 60 (20\u201360 keV)\n\n\u223c 1\n\u223c 0.5\n\u223c 0.5\n\u223c 1.5\n\u223c 2.5\n\u223c 31\n\n\u223c 80 (20\u201330\n\u223c 17\u22c6\n\u223c 17\u22c6\n\u223c 35 (20\u201340\n\u223c 40 (20\u201360\n\u223c 40 (20\u201360\n\nLuminosity-peak\n\u00d71036 erg s\u22121\n\nkTBB\nkeV\n\nkTBR\nkeV\n\n7\u00b10.7\n\n23+7\n\u22124.5\n\n7.4\u00b10.5\n\nkeV)\n\nkeV)\nkeV)\nkeV)\n\n22 +11\n\u22126\n\n\u2013 43 \u2013\n\nTable 6: Summary of characteristics of the 6 candidate supergiant fast X-ray transients\n\n\f\u2013 44 \u2013\nWe thank the anonymous referee for very useful comments which helped us to improve\nthe paper.
