N. Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences\nJD Block, Sector III, Salt Lake City, Calcutta -700 098, India.\n\nAbstract\nWe propose a technique called dimensional descent to show that Wigner's little group for\nmassless particles, which acts as a generator of gauge transformation for usual Maxwell theory,\nhas an identical role even for topologically massive gauge theories. The examples of B \u2227 F\ntheory and Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory are analyzed in details.\n\nWigner's little group[1], which is a subgroup of the Poincare group that leaves the fourmomentum invariant, is of fundamental importance for both massive and massless particles.\nIn the latter case this group is E(2), which is a semi-direct product of T (2) (the group of\ntranslations in the plane) and SO(2). Each of these subgroups has its own role, but here\nwe are concerned with T (2) which acts as a generator of gauge transformation[2, 3] in usual\ngauge theories, like Maxwell or Kalb-Ramond[4], where the quanta of excitations are massless.\nThere are however instances where gauge invariance coexists with mass - the topologically\nmassive gauge theories like the B \u2227 F [5] theory or the Maxwell-Chern-Simons(MCS)[6] theory\nin 2+1 dimensions. Recently we had shown[7] that in the B \u2227 F theory, the gauge invariance is\ngenerated by a particular representation of T (3) \u2282 E(3), so that one has to go beyond Wigner's\nlittle group. For the MCS model, however, Wigner's little group (isomorphic to R \u00d7 Z2 ) itself\nsuffices, albeit in a different representation. Is there then a systematic method of obtaining\nthese distinct representations and, if possible, connect them to Wigner's little group for massless\nparticles, which acts as gauge generator for conventional gauge theories?\nThe object of this paper is to analyze this and related issues. We show that the specific\nrepresentations of the translation groups that act as gauge generators of topologically massive\ngauge theories follow naturally by a dimensional descent of the standard representation of\nWigner's little group in one higher dimension. As a byproduct we show the connection between\nthe helicity quantum numbers of massless particles and the spin quantum number of massive\nparticles in one lower dimension.\n1\n2\n\nrabin@boson.bose.res.in\nbiswajit@boson.bose.res.in\n\n1\n\n\fLet us first recapitulate certain results[7] for the B \u2227 F theory in 3+1 dimensions, whose\ndynamics is governed by the following Lagrangian density3 [5]\n1\n1\nm\nL = \u2212 F \u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd + H\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb H \u03bc\u03bd\u03bb \u2212 \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c1 H \u03bc\u03bd\u03bb A\u03c1\n4\n12\n6\n\n(1)\n\nF\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202[\u03bc A\u03bd] ;\n\n(2)\n\nwhere,\nH\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb = \u2202[\u03bc B\u03bd\u03bb] ;\n\n\u03bc = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\nThe polarization vector(tensor) associated with the one(two) form fields A\u03bc (B\u03bd\u03bb ) are given\nby[7],\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n0 0\n0\n0\n0\n\uf8ec 0\n\uf8ec a \uf8f7\n0\na3 \u2212a2 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n(3)\n\u03b5 = {\u03b5\u03bd\u03bb } = \uf8ec\n\u03b5\u03bc = \u2212i \uf8ec 1 \uf8f7 ;\n\uf8ed 0 \u2212a3\n\uf8ed a2 \uf8f8\n0\na1 \uf8f8\n0 a2 \u2212a1 0\na3\n\ncorresponding to the momentum four-vector,\n\np\u03bc = (m, 0, 0, 0)T\n\n(4)\n\nfor a massive quanta at rest. Notice that the entries in (3) satisfy a duality relation connecting\nthe space components of the two matrices.\nIt might be mentioned that identical expressions for polarization vector(tensor) are obtained\nfor Proca( massive Kalb-Ramond) theory.4 This is not unexpected if one recalls the equivalence\nof the B \u2227 F model to such theories[8].\n\nTo begin with the present analysis, note that T (3), which acts as the generator of gauge\ntransformation in the B \u2227 F model[7], is an abelian invariant subgroup of E(3). The group\nE(3) is Wigner's little group for a massless particle in 5 dimensions. This suggests that we shall\nhave to consider 5(= 4+1) dimensional space-time. Now an element of Wigner's little group in\n5 dimensions can be written as\n\uf8eb\n\nW5 (p, q, r; \u03c8, \u03c6, \u03b7) =\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n1+\n\np2 +q 2 +r 2\n2\n\np\n\np\nq\nr\n\nq\n\nr\n\n\u2212p\n\nR(\u03c8, \u03c6, \u03b7)\n\np2 +q 2 +r 2\n2\n\np\n\nq\n\nr 1\u2212\n\n2 +q 2 +r 2\n\n2\n\n\u2212p\n\u2212q\n\u2212r\n\np2 +q 2 +r 2\n2\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(5)\n\nwhere p, q, r are any real numbers, while R(\u03c8, \u03c6, \u03b7) \u2208 SO(3), with (\u03c8, \u03c6, \u03b7) being a triplet of\nEuler angles. The above result can be derived by following the standard treatment[9]. The\ncorresponding element of the translational group T (3) can be trivially obtained by setting\nR(\u03c8, \u03c6, \u03b7) to be the identity matrix and will be denoted by W5 (p, q, r) = W5 (p, q, r; 0).\n3\n\nGreek indices will always denote 3+1 dimensional space-time. Latin indices from the middle of the alphabet(like i, j, k) will indicate 4+1 dimensions while those from the beginning(like a, b, c) will correspond to 2+1\ndimensions.\n4\nOf course the entries in the different matrices are now independent and are not constrained by the duality\nrelation mentioned earlier which is a consequence of the coupling term in the B \u2227 F model.\n\n2\n\n\fLet us now consider free Maxwell theory in 5-dimensions,\n1\nL = \u2212 F ij Fij ;\n4\n\ni, j = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n\n(6)\n\nA free photon will have three independent transverse degrees of freedom. Correspondingly the\npolarization vector \u03b5i can be brought to the following form,\n\u03b5i = (0, a1 , a2 , a3 , 0)T\n\n(7)\n\nif the photon of energy '\u03c9' is taken to be propagating in the 4-direction so that the energy\nmomentum 5-vector takes the following form\npi = (\u03c9, 0, 0, 0, \u03c9)T\n\n(8)\n\nNote that this automatically satisfies the 'Lorentz gauge' \u03b5i pi = 0. If we now suppress the last\nrows of the column matrices \u03b5i (7) and pi (8) we end up with the polarization vector and energymomentum 4-vector of a Proca quanta of mass m = \u03c9 in the rest frame in 3+1 dimensions.\nThis is equivalent to applying the projection operator given by the matrix\nP = diag(1, 1, 1, 1, 0)\n\n(9)\n\nand deleting the last rows which now have only null entries. This method of getting results\nin any dimension by starting from the known results in one dimension higher will be called\ndimensional descent.\nSimilarly, to reproduce the polarization tensor of massive Kalb-Ramond(KR) theory in 3+1\ndimensions let us consider free massless KR model in 5-dimensions,\nL=\n\n1 ijk\nH Hijk\n12\n\n(10)\n\nProceeding just as in [7], the polarization matrix \u03b5 = {\u03b5ij } can be brought to the following\nmaximally reduced form\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03b5 = {\u03b5ij } =\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n12\n0\n0\n\u03b5\n\u03b513\n12\n0 \u2212\u03b5\n0\n\u03b523\n0 \u2212\u03b513 \u2212\u03b523 0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(11)\n\nAgain deleting the last row and column, one gets the polarization tensor(\u03b5\u0304) (3) of the massive\nKR model. This is equivalent to applying the projection operator as P\u03b5P. Thus the polarization\nvector and tensor of the Proca and massive KR models, respectively, have been reproduced.\nNow coming to the gauge transformation properties of polarization vector (7) and polarization tensor (11) under the translational subgroup T (3), let W5 (p, q, r) act on these objects one\nby one. First, acting on \u03b5i (7), one gets\n\u03b5i \u2192 \u03b5\u2032i = W5 (p, q, r)i j \u03b5j = \u03b5i + \u03b4\u03b5i = \u03b5i + (pa1 + qa2 + ra3 )\n3\n\npi\n\u03c9\n\n(12)\n\n\fwhich is indeed a gauge transformation in (4+1) dimensional Maxwell theory. Applying the\nprojection operator P (9) on (12) yields\n\u03b4\u03b5\u0304\u03bc = P\u03b4\u03b5i =\n\n1\n(pa1 + qa2 + ra3 )p\u03bc\n\u03c9\n\n(13)\n\nHere \u03b5\u0304\u03bc = (0, a1 , a2 , a3 )T and, modulus the i-factor, corresponds to the expression in (3). This is\nprecisely how the polarization vector in B \u2227F theory transforms under gauge transformation[7].\nIn fact we can write\n\u03b4\u03b5\u0304\u03bc = D \u03bc \u03bd (p, q, r)\u03b5\u0304\u03bd \u2212 \u03b5\u0304\u03bc\n(14)\nwhere,\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\n\uf8ec\nD(p, q, r) = \uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\np\n1\n0\n0\n\nq\n0\n1\n0\n\nr\n0\n0\n1\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(15)\n\nComing next to the polarization matrix \u03b5 = {\u03b5ij }, its transformation law is given by,\n\u03b5 \u2192 \u03b5\u2032 = W5 (p, q, r)\u03b5W5T (p, q, r) = \u03b5 + \u03b4\u03b5\nwhere,\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03b4\u03b5 = {\u03b4\u03b5ij } =\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8f6\n\n0 \u03b11 \u03b12 \u03b13\n0\n\uf8f7\n\u2212\u03b11 0 0 0 \u2212\u03b11 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\u2212\u03b12 0 0 0 \u2212\u03b12 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\u2212\u03b13 0 0 0 \u2212\u03b13 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n0 \u03b11 \u03b12 \u03b13\n0\n\n(16)\n\nwhere, \u03b11 = \u2212(q\u03b512 + r\u03b513 ), \u03b12 = (p\u03b512 \u2212 r\u03b523 )), \u03b13 = (p\u03b513 + q\u03b523 ). Again this can be\neasily recognized as a gauge transformation in (4+1) dimensional KR theory involving massless\nquanta, as \u03b4\u03b5ij can be expressed as \u2248 (pi f j (p) \u2212 pj f i (p)) with suitable choice for f i (p), where\npi is of the form (8). Now applying the projection operator P (9), we get the change in the 3+1\ndimensional polarization matrix \u03b5\u0304 = {\u03b5\u03bc\u03bd }, by the formula, \u03b4\u03b5\u0304 = P\u03b4\u03b5P T . This simply amounts\nto a deletion of the last row and column of \u03b4\u03b5. The result can be expressed more compactly as\n\u03b4\u03b5\u0304 = (D\u03b5\u0304D T \u2212 \u03b5\u0304)\n\n(17)\n\nwhere D has already been defined in (15). Again this has the precise form of gauge transformation of the polarization matrix of B \u2227 F model[7], since it can be cast in the form\n\u03b4\u03b5\u0304\u03bc\u03bd = i(p\u03bc f\u03bd (p) \u2212 p\u03bd f\u03bc (p))\n\n(18)\n\nfor a suitable f\u03bc (p), where the form of p\u03bc is now given by (4).\nClearly the generators T1 = \u2202D\n, T2 = \u2202D\n, T3 = \u2202D\nprovide a Lie algebra basis for the abelian\n\u2202p\n\u2202q\n\u2202r\ngroup T (3), as they commute mutually. Note that they also satisfy\n(T1 )2 = (T2 )2 = (T3 )2 = T1 T2 = T1 T3 = T2 T3 = 0\n4\n\n(19)\n\n\fso that\nD(p, q, r) = epT1 +qT2 +rT3 = 1 + pT1 + qT2 + rT3\n\n(20)\n\nThe change in the polarisation vector \u03b5\u0304 (14) can be expressed as the action of a Lie algebra\nelement,\n\u03b4\u03b5\u0304\u03bc = (pT1 + qT2 + rT3 )\u03b5\u0304\u03bc\n(21)\nBesides this D also preserves the 4-momentum of a particle at rest. This representation of\nD(p, q, r) was earlier introduced in [7]. However, here we have shown it can be connected to the\nWigner's little group for massless particle in 4+1 dimensions through appropriate projection in\nthe intermediate steps, where the massless particles moving in 4+1 dimensions can be associated\nwith a massive particle at rest in 3+1 dimensions. Similarly the polarization vector and tensor\nof B \u2227 F theory in 3+1 dimensions can be associated with polarization vector and polarization\ntensor of free Maxwell and KR theories in 4+1 dimensions.\nAt this stage, one can ask whether the same features of dimensional descent from higher\n3 + 1 dimensions will go through for the topologically massive Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory in\n2+1 dimension. For that let us start with free Maxwell theory in 3+1 dimension. This has two\ntransverse degrees of freedom. Correspondingly the polarization vector \u03b5\u03bc takes the following\nmaximally reduced form \u03b5\u03bc = (0, a, b, 0)T , if the 4-momentum p\u03bc of the photon of energy '\u03c9'\nand propagating in the 3-direction takes the following form p\u03bc = (\u03c9, 0, 0, \u03c9)T . The generator of\ngauge transformation in this case is T (2), which is a subgroup of E(2). Now the representation\nof the 3+1 dimensional Wigner's little group W4 (p, q, \u03c6) is just obtained from W5 (p, q, r; \u03c8, \u03c6, \u03b7)\nby replacing R(\u03c8, \u03c6, \u03b7) by R(\u03c6) \u2208 SO(2), by deleting the columns and rows involving r and\nfinally setting r = 0 elsewhere. To obtain a (4 \u00d7 4) representation of T (2) one just sets \u03c6 = 0\nin W4 (p, q, \u03c6).\nWe are now ready to discuss the dimensional descent from 3+1 to 2+1 dimensions. As a first\nstep, this involves reducing the last rows of \u03b5\u03bc and p\u03bc to zero by using the projection operator\nP = diag(1, 1, 1, 0). The descended objects \u03b5\u0304a = (0, a1 , a2 )T (a = 0, 1, 2) and pa = (\u03c9, 0, 0)T\ncorrespond to the polarization vector and momentum 3-vector of a Proca quanta of mass \u03c9 at\nrest, of the corresponding Proca theory\n1\n\u03c92\nL = \u2212 F ab Fab + Aa Aa\n(22)\n4\n2\nin 2+1 dimensions. In order to discuss the gauge transformation properties it is essential to\nprovide a 3 \u00d7 3 representation of T (2) (denoted by D\u0304(p, q)) which amounts to deleting the last\nrow and column of D(p, q, r) in (15),\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n1 p q\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\nD\u0304(p, q) = \uf8ed 0 1 0 \uf8f8\n0 0 1\n\n(23)\n\nThe corresponding generators are given by,\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n0 1 0\n\u2202 D\u0304 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nT\u03041 =\n= \uf8ed 0 0 0 \uf8f8;\n\u2202p\n0 0 0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n0 0 1\n\u2202 D\u0304 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nT\u03042 =\n=\uf8ed 0 0 0 \uf8f8\n\u2202q\n0 0 0\n5\n\n(24)\n\n\fJust as the Proca theory in 3+1 dimensions maps to the B \u2227F theory, where gauge transformations were discussed, the Proca theory in 2+1 dimensions is actually a doublet of MaxwellChern-Simons theories,[10, 11]\nL = L+ \u2295 L\u2212\n(25)\nwhere\n\n1\n\u03b8\nL\u00b1 = \u2212 F ab Fab \u00b1 \u01ebabc Aa \u2202b Ac\n(26)\n4\n2\nwith each of L+ or L\u2212 being a topologically massive gauge theory. The mass of the MCS\nquanta is \u03c9 = |\u03b8|, where \u03c9 is the parameter entering in (22). We can therefore study the gauge\ntransformation generated in this doublet. The polarization vector for L\u00b1 , with only one degree\nof freedom for each of L+ and L\u2212 , has been found to be[12, 13]\n1\n\u03b5\u0304a\u00b1 = \u221a (0, 1, \u00b1i)T\n2\n\n(27)\n\nwhile the 3-momentum pa obviously takes the same form as in the Proca model. In analogy\nwith (21), here also one can write,\n\u03b4\u03b5\u0304a = (pT\u03041 + q T\u03042 )a b \u03b5\u0304b\n\n(28)\n\nwhere \u03b5\u0304a = (0, a1 , a2 )T is the polarization vector for the Proca theory in 2+1 dimensions. Had\nthe Proca theory been a gauge theory, (28) would have represented a gauge transformation, as\nit can be written as\npa1 + qa2 a\np\n(29)\n\u03b4\u03b5\u0304a =\n\u03c9\nBut since Proca theory is not a gauge theory, we can only study the gauge transformation\nproperties of each of the doublet L\u00b1 (26) individually. First note that the Proca polarization\nvector \u03b5\u0304a is just a linear combination of the two real orthonormal canonical vectors \u03b51 and \u03b52\nwhere,\n\u03b5\u0304a = a1 \u03b51 + a2 \u03b52 ;\n\u03b51 = (0, 1, 0)T , \u03b52 = (0, 0, 1)T\n(30)\nCorrespondingly the generators T\u03041 and T\u03042 (24), form an orthonormal basis as they satisfy\ntr(T\u0304a\u2020 T\u0304b ) = \u03b4ab . Furthermore,\nT\u03041 \u03b51 = T\u03042 \u03b52 = (1, 0, 0)T =\n\npa\n,\n\u03c9\n\nT\u03041 \u03b52 = T\u03042 \u03b51 = 0\n\n(31)\n\nOn the other hand, the polarization vectors \u03b5\u0304a+ and \u03b5\u0304a\u2212 (27) also provide an orthonormal basis(complex) in the plane as\n(\u03b5\u0304a+ )\u2020 (\u03b5\u0304a\u2212 ) = 0;\n\n(\u03b5\u0304a+ )\u2020 (\u03b5\u0304a+ ) = (\u03b5\u0304a\u2212 )\u2020 (\u03b5\u0304a\u2212 ) = 1\n\n(32)\n\nand can be obtained from the above mentioned canonical ones by appropriate SU(2) transformation. This suggests that we consider the following orthonormal basis for the Lie algebra of\nT (2):\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0 1 \u2213i\n1 \uf8ec\n1\n\uf8f7\n(33)\nT\u0304\u00b1 = \u221a (T\u03041 \u2213 iT\u03042 ) = \u221a \uf8ed 0 0 0 \uf8f8\n2\n2 0 0 0\n6\n\n\finstead of T\u03041 and T\u03042 . Note that they also satisfy relations similar to the (1-2) basis,\ntr(T\u0304+\u2020 T\u0304+ ) = tr(T\u0304\u2212\u2020 T\u0304\u2212 ) = 1; tr(T\u0304+\u2020 T\u0304\u2212 ) = 0\n\n(34)\n\nOne can now easily see that\nT\u0304+ \u03b5+ = T\u0304\u2212 \u03b5\u2212 =\n\npa\n,\n\u03c9\n\nT\u0304+ \u03b5\u2212 = T\u0304\u2212 \u03b5+ = 0\n\n(35)\n\nanalogous to (31). Furthermore,\n\u03b4\u03b5\u0304a\u00b1 = \u03b1\u00b1 T\u0304\u00b1 \u03b5\u0304a\u00b1 =\n\n\u03b1\u00b1 a\np\n\u03c9\n\n(36)\n\nThis indicates that T\u0304\u00b1 - the generators of the Lie algebra of T (2) in the rotated (complex)basis generate independent gauge transformations in L\u00b1 respectively. One therefore can understand\nhow the appropriate representation of the generator of gauge transformation in the doublet of\nMCS theory can be obtained from higher 3+1 dimensional Wigner's group through dimensional\ndescent. A finite gauge transformation is obtained by integrating (36) i.e., exponentiating the\ncorresponding Lie algebra element. This gives two representations of Wigner's little group for\nmassless particles in 2 + 1 dimensions, which is isomorphic to R \u00d7 Z2 , although here we are\njust considering the component which is connected to the identity,\nG\u00b1 (\u03b1\u00b1 ) = e\u03b1\u00b1 T\u0304\u00b1\n\n1\n\uf8ec\n= 1 + \u03b1\u00b1 T\u0304\u00b1 = \uf8ed 0\n0\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03b1\n\u221a\u00b1\n2\n\n1\n0\n\n\u2213i \u03b1\u221a\u00b12\n\uf8f7\n0 \uf8f8\n1\n\uf8f6\n\n(37)\n\nNote that G\u00b1 (\u03b1\u00b1 ) generates gauge transformation in the doublet L\u00b1 , and are related by complex conjugation. This complex conjugation is also a symmetry of the doublet. Such representations were earlier considered in [13].\nAnother aspect of this doublet structure is illuminated by observing that, in the 3+1 dimensional case, the photon has two helicity states (\u00b11), as follows from topological considerations\n[9]. By our dimensional descent this corresponds to the two spin states of the Proca quanta in\n2+1 dimensions. Each of these states is shared amongst the two components of the doublet(25).\nThis is consistent with the fact that an explicit computation of the spin in the MCS theory(L\u00b1 )\n(25) leads to the same values[6].\nWe conclude by observing the unified picture that emerges from this analysis. It might\nbe recalled that Wigner's little group for massive and massless particles can be regarded as\nhaving a common origin. This is because the E(2) like little group for massless particle is\nobtained from the SO(3) like little group for massive particles in the infinite momentum/zero\nmass limit[14]. It is essentially a consequence of the group contraction method connecting\nthese two groups[15]. In this paper we showed the common origin of the gauge generators for\nusual(i.e., massless) or topologically massive gauge theories. The representations in the latter\nare obtained by a dimensional descent from one higher dimension of the representation in the\nformer. Following the same ideas it was possible to interpret the spin quantum number of\n7\n\n\fmassive particles as the helicity quantum number of massless particles in one higher dimension.\nAs a bonus the structure of the Proca model(in 2+1 dimensions) as a doublet of Maxwell-ChernSimons theories gets manifested. This is distinctive from the Proca model in 3+1 dimensions\nwhich gets mapped to the B \u2227 F model and is devoid of any doublet structure. Finally, the\nfact that the gauge generators annihilated the physical states was very similar to the Dirac\nHamiltonian formulation[16] where the Gauss operators, which act as gauge generators, share\nthe same property. It would be worthwhile to pursue this connection between the Wigner's\nlittle group and the Gauss operators.\n\nReferences\n[1] E. P. Wigner, Ann. Math. 40(1939)149.\n[2] D. Han and Y.S. Kim, Am. J.
