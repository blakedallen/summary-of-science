Introduction\nThe Copenhagen interpretation deals with quantum uncertainties through the\nconcepts of physical systems and observers. However it is not correct to say that\nin the orthodox interpretation system and observer are \"separated\" since they are\nboth declared to be meaningful only through their interaction during the measurement process. Effectively in most cases observer is replaced by the state of a\nphysical system and a measurement gives the probability for an observer to find\nthe system in a particular state. Thus the triad of system-state-measurement forms\nthe starting point in any mathematical model of quantum mechanics [39]. Even\nthe schemes opposing the Copenhagen interpretation, e.g Bohmian mechanics [8, 7]\nand contextual interpretation [18, 19], could not escape this structure implemented\nin one or another way. For example, the Bohm approach [8, 7] may be interpreted\nin these terms as follows:\nCopenhagen interpretation\nBohmian approach\na physical system governed\na hidden wave described\nby the Sch\u00f6dinger equation\nby the master equation\nan independent observer\na physical particle\na measurement of the\nan accidental choice of\nsystem by the observer\na trajectory by the particle\nwith probabilistic outcome\nalong the wave\nOriginally quantum mechanics was implemented through the Hamiltonian formalism borrowed from classical mechanics. It became important from the idealogical point of view to find a system-state-measurement triple in the classical\nframework. The description of classical mechanics in these words could be found in\nthe introductory chapters of almost all textbooks on quantum mechanics [31] since\nthe only \"king road\" into the quantum world is still going through the classical\n\"pathway\". On the other hand textbooks devoted only to classical theory [2, 13]\nusually ignore an analysis of this observable-state-measurement triad as having\nlittle relevance in classical picture.\nIt is commonly accepted that observables form an algebra both in quantum and\nclassical mechanics: non-commutative in the former case and commutative in the\nlater. Then states are defined as positive linear functionals on those algebras: in\nquantum mechanics pure states are labelled by certain vectors in a Hilbert spaces\nand classic pure states correspond to points of the phase space. Measurements are\nrepresented by evaluation of observables on particular states.\n\n\fOBSERVABLES AND STATES p-MECHANICS\n\n3\n\nIn this paper we are going to present a description of observables and states\nwithin the framework of p-mechanics [24, 35, 27, 26, 9]. p-Mechanics unifies Hamilton formulations of quantum and classical mechanics on the grounds of the representation theory of the Heisenberg group. Therefore our approach coincides with\nthe traditional route in many principal positions. On the other hand p-mechanics\n(being based only on the natural properties of Heisenberg group) is in better agreement with physical requirements and sheds an additional light on the known results\nand constructions in both mechanics.\nFor example, the widespread agreement about observables being elements of an\nalgebra contradicts the basic physical principle that all measurements (and thus observables) are evaluated in certain physical units. The multiplication of two physical\nquantities with different units is natural, for example, velocity multiplied by time\ngives length. However the addition of two physical quantities in different units is\nunacceptable, for example, you cannot add something measured in kilogrammes\nwith something measured in centimetres. In p-mechanics we don't allow addition\nto be freely permitted by replacing \"algebra\" with \"symmetric space\". For a more\nin depth description of this dimensional analysis see [26, \u00a7\u00a7 1.1, 1.2].\np-Mechanical observables [24, 26] are identified with convolution operators on the\nHeisenberg group and labelled by kernels of these convolutions. By the representations of the Heisenberg group convolutions are transformed into well known images\nof quantum (operators on a Hilbert space) and classical (functions on the phase\nspace) observables. Therefore it is natural to define [9] p-states in line with quantum and classic cases as positive linear functionals on the space of p-observables.\nElaboration of this approach is the main purpose of the present paper.\nThe paper outline is as follows. In the next Section we present the representation theory of the Heisenberg group based on the orbit method of Kirillov [23] and\nutilising Fock\u2013Segal\u2013Bargmann spaces [12, 16]. We emphasise the existence and\napplicability of the family of one-dimensional representations: they play for classical mechanics exactly the same r\u00f4le as the infinite dimensional representations-for\nquantum. In section 3 we introduce the concept of both states and observables in\np-mechanics and describe relations with their quantum and classical counterparts.\nThese links are provided by the representations of the Heisenberg group and wavelet\ntransforms. In subsections 4.1 and 4.1 we study p-mechanical brackets and the associated dynamic equation together with its classical and quantum representations.\nWhile in subsections 4.2 and 4.3 we describe the time evolution of p-Mechanical\nstates and prove that it agrees with the time evolution of observables in doing so we\nexhibit the pictures of p-dynamics. In section 4.5 we introduce a system of coherent\nstates for p-mechanics. Finally in section 5 we demonstrate the theory through the\nexamples of the forced and unforced harmonic oscillator.\n\n2. The Heisenberg Group and Its Representations\nWe start from the representation theory of the Heisenberg group Hn based on\nthe orbit method of Kirillov. Analysis of the unitary dual of Hn in Subsection 2.2\nsuggests that the family of one-dimensional representations of Hn forms the phase\nspace of a classical system. Infinite dimensional representations in a Fock type\nspace are described in Subsection 2.3.\n\n\f4\n\nA. BRODLIE AND V. V. KISIL\n\nAs was mentioned in the Introduction p-mechanics does not associate observables\nwith an algebra since this contradicts the physical reality. In order to emphasise that\nfeature of p-mechanics we supply the analysis of dimensions along our construction.\nLet M be a unit of mass, L-of length, T -of time. Then coordinates of a point\nin phase space, (q, p) are measured in units L and M L/T (momentum) respectively.\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n, \u2202p\n, \u2202t\nof an observables with respect to coordinates, momentum,\nDerivatives \u2202q\nand time are measured by 1/L, T /(M L), and 1/T respectively. Corresponding\ndifferentials dq, dp, and dt are measured in the according units: L, M L/T , and\nT in order to make the inner product of vectors and 1-forms a dimensionless pure\nnumber. Throughout this paper only physical quantities of the same dimension can\nbe added or subtracted together.\n2.1. Representations Hn and the Method of Orbits. Let (s, x, y), where x,\ny \u2208 Rn and s \u2208 R, be an element of the Heisenberg group Hn [12, 16]. We assign to\nx and y components of (s, x, y) physical units 1/L and T /(LM ) respectively. We\nchose these units so that qx and py are dimensionless products.\nThe group law on Hn is given as follows:\n1\n(s, x, y) \u2217 (s\u2032 , x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) = (s + s\u2032 + \u03c9(x, y; x\u2032 , y \u2032 ), x + x\u2032 , y + y \u2032 ),\n(2.1)\n2\nwhere the non-commutativity is solely due to \u03c9-the symplectic form [2, \u00a7 37] on\nthe Euclidean space R2n :\n\u03c9(x, y; x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) = xy \u2032 \u2212 x\u2032 y.\n\n(2.2)\n2\n\nConsequently the parameters s should be measured in T /(L M )-the product of\nunits of x and y. The Lie algebra hn of Hn is spanned by a basis S, Xj , Yj ,\nj = 1, . . . , n which may be represented by either left- or right-invariant vector fields\non Hn :\n\u2202\nyj \u2202\n\u2202\nxj \u2202\n\u2202\nl(r)\nl(r)\n\u2212\n=\u00b1\n+\nXj = \u00b1\n,\nYj\n(2.3)\nS l(r) = \u00b1 ,\n\u2202s\n\u2202xj\n2 \u2202s\n\u2202yj\n2 \u2202s\nwith the Heisenberg commutator relations\nl(r)\n\n[Xi\n\nl(r)\n\n, Yj\n\n] = \u03b4i,j S l(r)\n\n(2.4)\n\nall other commutators (including any between left and right vector fields) vanish.\nl(r)\nl(r)\nare inverse to s, x, y-i.e. L2 M/T , L, and\nUnits to measure S l(r) , Xj , and Yj\nLM/T respectively-which are obviously compatible with (2.4).\nThe exponential map exp : hn \u2192 Hn is provided by the formula:\nn\nX\n(xj Xj + yj Yj ) 7\u2192 (s, x1 , . . . , xn , y1 , . . . , yn ).\nexp : sS +\nj=1\n\nwhich respects multiplication (2.1) and the Heisenberg commutator relations (2.4).\nThe composition of the exponential map with representations (2.3) of hn by the\nleft(right)-invariant vector fields produces the right (left) regular representation\n\u03bbr(l) of Hn by right (left) shifts. Linearised [21, \u00a7 7.1] to L2 (Hn ) they are:\n\u03bbr (g) : f (h) 7\u2192 f (hg),\n\n\u03bbl (g) : f (h) 7\u2192 f (g \u22121 h),\n\nwhere f (h) \u2208 L2 (Hn ).

All representations are induced [21, \u00a7 13] by a character \u03c7h (s, 0, 0) = e2\u03c0ihs of the centre of\nHn generated by (h, 0, 0) \u2208 h\u2217n and shifts (2.6) from the \"left hand side\" (i.e. by\ng \u22121 ) on orbits. Using [21, \u00a7 13.2, Prob. 5] we get a neat formula, which (unlike\nsome others in the literature, e.g. [38, Chap. 1, (2.23)]) respects the rule that you\ncannot add any two physical quantities of different units:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nh\nh\n\u22122\u03c0i(hs+qx+py)\n(2.9)\n\u03c1h (s, x, y) : fh (q, p) 7\u2192 e\nfh q \u2212 y, p + x .\n2\n2\nExactly the same formula is obtained if we apply the Fourier transform \u02c6 : L2 (Hn ) \u2192\nL2 (h\u2217n ) given by:\nZ\n(F (\u03c6))(Y ) = \u03c6\u0302(Y ) =\n\u03c6(exp X)e\u22122\u03c0ihX,Y i dX\nwhere X \u2208 hn , Y \u2208 h\u2217n\nhn\n\n(2.10)\n\nto the left regular action (2.5), that is\n\u03bbl (g)F = F \u03c1h (g).\n\n(2.11)\n\nSee [23, \u00a7 2.3] for relations between the Fourier transform (2.10) and the orbit\nmethod.\nThe derived representation d\u03c1h of the Lie algebra hn defined on the vector\nfields (2.3) is:\nh\nh\n\u2202p \u2212 2\u03c0iqj I, d\u03c1h (Yj ) = \u2212 \u2202qj \u2212 2\u03c0ipj I, (2.12)\n2 j\n2\nwhich clearly represent the commutation rules (2.4). The representation \u03c1h (2.9)\nis reducible on the whole of L2 (Oh ) as can be seen from the existence of the set of\n\"right-invariant\", i.e. commuting with (2.12), differential operators:\nd\u03c1h (S) = \u22122\u03c0ihI, d\u03c1h (Xj ) =\n\nh\nh\nd\u03c1rh (Xj ) = \u2212 \u2202pj \u2212 2\u03c0iqj I, d\u03c1rh (Yj ) = \u2202qj \u2212 2\u03c0ipj I. (2.13)\n2\n2\nThese vectors fields represent the commutation rules (2.4) as well.\nTo obtain an irreducible representation defined by (2.9) we need to restrict it to a\nsubspace of L2 (Oh ) where the operators (2.13) act as scalars, e.g. use a polarisation\nfrom geometric quantisation [40]. Consider for h > 0 the vector field \u2212Xj + ici Yj\nfrom the complexification of hn , where a constant ci has the dimension T /M , the\nd\u03c1rh (S) = 2\u03c0ihI,\n\n\f6\n\nA. BRODLIE AND V. V.

For h < 0 we define Dhj = d\u03c1rh (\u2212ci Yj +iXj ). Operators (2.14)\nare used to give the following classical result in terms of orbits:\nTheorem 2.1 (Stone\u2013von Neumann, cf. [12, Chap. 1, \u00a7 5], [21, \u00a7 18.4]). All unitary\nirreducible representations of Hn are parametrised up to equivalence by two classes\nof orbits (2.7) and (2.8) of the co-adjoint representation (2.6) in h\u2217n :\n(1) The infinite dimensional representations by transformation \u03c1h (2.9) for h 6=\n0 in Fock [12, 16] space F2 (Oh ) \u2282 L2 (Oh ) of null solutions to the operators\nDhj (2.14):\nF2 (Oh ) = {fh (q, p) \u2208 L2 (Oh ) | Dhj fh = 0, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n}.\n\n(2.15)\n\n(2) The one-dimensional representations as multiplication by a constant on C =\nL2 (O(q,p) ) which drops out from (2.9) for h = 0:\n\u03c1(q,p) (s, x, y) : c 7\u2192 e\u22122\u03c0i(qx+py) c,\n\n(2.16)\n\nwith the corresponding derived representation\nd\u03c1(q,p) (S) = 0,\n\nd\u03c1(q,p) (Xj ) = \u22122\u03c0iqj ,\n\nd\u03c1(q,p) (Yj ) = \u22122\u03c0ipj .\n\n(2.17)\n\nn\n\n2.2. Structure and Topology of the Unitary Dual of H . The structure of\nthe unitary dual object to Hn -the collection of all different classes of unitary\nirreducible representations-as it appears from the method of orbits is illustrated\nby Figure 1, cf. [22, Chap. 7, Fig. 6 and 7]. The adjoint space h\u2217n is sliced into\n\"horizontal\" hyperplanes. A plane with a parameter h 6= 0 forms a single orbit (2.7)\nand corresponds to a particular class of unitary irreducible representations (2.9).\nThe plane with parameter h = 0 is a family of one-point orbits (0, q, p) (2.8),\nwhich produce one-dimensional representations (2.16). The topology on the dual\nobject is the factor topology inherited from the adjoint space h\u2217n under the above\nidentification, see [23, \u00a7 2.2].\nExample 2.2. A set of representations \u03c1h (2.9) with h \u2192 0 is dense in the whole\nfamily of one-dimensional representations (2.16), as can be seen either from the\nFigure 1 or the analytic expressions (2.9) and (2.16) for those representations.\nNon-commutative representations \u03c1h , h 6= 0 (2.9) have been connected with\nquantum mechanics from the very beginning [12], this explains, for example, the\nname of the Heisenberg group. In contrast the commutative representations (2.16)\nare always neglected and only mentioned for completeness in mathematical formulations of the Stone\u2013von Neumann theorem. The development of p-mechanics\nstarts [24] from the observation that the union of all representations \u03c1(q,p) , (q, p) \u2208\nR2n naturally acts as the classical phase space. The appropriateness of the single\nunion\n[\nO(q,p)\n(2.18)\nO0 =\n(q,p)\u2208R2n\n\nrather than unrelated sets of disconnected orbits manifests itself in several ways:\n\n\fOBSERVABLES AND STATES p-MECHANICS\n\n7\n\nh\nParameter h 6= 0\nh>0\np\nh=0\n\np\nq\n\nR 2n\n\nq\nR 2n\n\nPhase space (h = 0)\nh<0\n\nThe adjoint space h\u2217n of the algebra hn\n\nThe unitary dual of Hn\n\nFigure 1. Structure of the unitary dual object to Hn appearing\nfrom the method of orbits. The space h\u2217n is sliced into \"horizontal\"\nhyperplanes. Planes with h 6= 0 form single orbits and correspond\nto different classes of unitary irreducible representation. The plane\nh = 0 is a family of one-point orbits (0, q, p), which produce onedimensional representations. The topology on the dual object is\nthe factor topology inherited from the h\u2217n [23, \u00a7 2.2].\n(1) The topological position of O0 as the limiting case (cf. Example 2.2) of\nquantum mechanics for h \u2192 0 realises the correspondence principle between\nquantum and classical mechanics.\n(2) Symplectic automorphisms of the Heisenberg group (see Subsection 4.4)\nproduce the metaplectic representation in quantum mechanics and transitively acts by linear symplectomorphisms on the whole set O0 \\ {0}.\n(3) We got the Poisson brackets (4.7) on O0 from the same source (4.2) which\nleads to the correct Heisenberg equation in quantum mechanics.\nOur form (2.9) of representations of Hn given in Theorem 2.1 has at least two\nfollowing advantages which are rarely combined together:\n(1) There is the explicit physical meaning of all entries in (2.9) as will be seen\n\u221a\nbelow. In contrast the formula (2.23) in [38, Chap. 1] contains terms h\n(in our notations) which could be hardly justified from a physical point of\nview.\n(2) The one-dimensional representations (2.16) explicitly correspond to the case\nh = 0 in (2.9). The Schr\u00f6dinger representation (the most used in quantum\nmechanics!) is handicapped in this sense: the transition for h \u2192 0 from \u03c1h\nin the Sch\u00f6dinger form to \u03c1(q,p) requires a long discussion [22, Ex. 7.11].\nWe finish the discussion of the unitary dual of Hn by a remark about negative\nvalues of h. Due to its position in the Heisenberg equation the negative value of ~\nwill revert the flow of time. Thus representations \u03c1h with h < 0 seem to be suitable\nfor a description of anti-particles with the explicit (cf. Figure 1) mirror symmetry\nbetween matter and anti-matter through classical mechanics. In this paper however\nwe will consider only the case of h > 0.\n2.3. Fock Spaces F2 (Oh ). Our Fock type spaces (2.15) are not very different [25,\nEx. 4.3] from the standard Segal\u2013Bargmann spaces.\n\n\f8\n\nA. BRODLIE AND V. V. KISIL\n\nDefinition 2.3. [12, 16] The Segal\u2013Bargmann space (with a parameter h > 0)\nconsists of functions on Cn which are holomorphic in z, i.e. \u2202z\u0304j f (z) = 0, and\n2\nsquare integrable with respect to the measure e\u22122|z| /h dz on Cn :\nZ\n2\n2\n|f (z)| e\u22122|z| /h dz < \u221e.\nCn\n\nNoticing the \u2202z\u0304j component in the operator Dhj (2.14) we obviously obtain\nProposition 2.4. [26] A function fh (q, p) is in F2 (Oh ) (2.15) for h > 0 if and only\n2\nif the function fh (z)e|z| /h , z = p + iq is in the classical Segal\u2013Bargmann space.\nThe space F2 (Oh ) can also be described in the language of coherent states,\n(also known as wavelets, matrix elements of representation, Berezin transform, etc.,\nsee [1]). Since the representation \u03c1h is irreducible any vector f0 in F2 (Oh ) is cyclic,\ni.e. vectors \u03c1h (g)f0 for all g \u2208 G span the space F2 (Oh ). However even if all vectors\nare equally good in principle, some of them are more equal for particular purposes.\nOur best option is to take the vector in F2 (Oh ) corresponding to the vacuum state\n1 2\np ) where \u03c9 is\nof the harmonic oscillator with classical Hamiltonian 21 (m\u03c9 2 q 2 + m\n1\nthe constant frequency (measured in units T ) and m is the constant mass:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0001\n2\u03c0\n(2.19)\n(\u03c9m)q 2 + (\u03c9m)\u22121 p2 ,\nf0 (q, p) = exp \u2212\nh\n\nwhich corresponds to the minimum level of energy. Note also that f0 (q, p) is destroyed by the annihilation operators (sf. (2.12) and (2.14)):\nh\n(\u2202p \u2212 ici \u2202qj ) + 2\u03c0(ci pj \u2212 iqj )I.\n2 j\nWe introduce a dimensionless inner product on F2 (Oh ) by the formula:\n\u0012 \u0013n Z\n4\nf1 (q, p) f \u03042 (q, p) dq dp\nhf1 , f2 i =\nh\nR2n\nAjh = d\u03c1h (Xj + ici Yj ) =\n\n(2.20)\n\n(2.21)\n\nWith respect to this product the vacuum vector (2.19) is normalised: kf0 k = 1.\nFor a dimensionless vector f \u2208 F2 (Oh ) the formula defines a state\n\u0012 \u0013n Z\n4\nhAf, f i =\nAf (q, p) f \u0304(q, p) dq dp\n(2.22)\nh\nR2n\nwhich for any observable A will give an expectation in the units of A, since the inner\nproduct is dimensionless.The term h\u2212n in (2.21) not only normalises the vacuum\nand fixes the dimensionality of the inner product; it is also related to the Plancherel\nmeasure [12, (1.61)], [38, Chap. 1, Th. 2.6] on the unitary dual of Hn .\nElements (s, 0, 0) of the centre of Hn trivially act in the representation \u03c1h (2.9) as\nmultiplication by scalars, e.g. any function is a common eigenvector of all operators\n\u03c1h (s, 0, 0). Thus the essential part of the operator \u03c1h (s, x, y) is determined solely\nby (x, y) \u2208 R2n . The coherent states for F2 (Oh ), f(x,y) (q, p), are \"left shifts\" of the\nvacuum vector f0 (q, p) by operators (2.9):\nf(x,y)(q, p) = \u03c1h (0, x, y)f0 (q, p)\n= exp \u22122\u03c0i(qx + py) \u2212\n\n2\u03c0\nh\n\n(2.23)\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u00132 !!\nh\nh\n\u03c9m q \u2212 y + (\u03c9m)\u22121 p + x\n.\n2\n2\n\n\fOBSERVABLES AND STATES p-MECHANICS\n\n9\n\nNow any function from the space F2 (Oh ) can be represented [25, Ex. 4.3] as a\nlinear superposition of coherent states:\nZ\nf (q, p) = [Mh f \u0306](q, p) = hn\nf \u0306(x, y)f(x,y) (q, p) dx dy\n(2.24)\nR2n\n\nwhere f \u0306(x, y) is the wavelet transform [1, 25] of f (q, p):\nf \u0306(x, y) = [Wh f ](x, y) =\n=\n\nf, f(x,y) F (O )\nh\n\u0012 \u0013n Z 2\n4\nf (q, p)f \u0304(x,y) (q, p) dq dp.\nh\nR2n\n\n(2.25)\n\nThe formula (2.24) can be regarded [25] as the inverse wavelet transform M of\nf \u0306(x, y).\nThis set of coherent states, f(x,y) , are useful as an overcomplete system of vectors\nin F2 (Oh ) and in exhibiting relations between p-mechanics and Berezin quantisation\n(subsection 3.2). Unfortunately the \"classical limits\" for h \u2192 0 of all these coherent\nstates are functions supported in the neighbourhood of (0, 0). Instead we want them\nto be supported around different classical states (q, p). This defect is resolved in\nsection 4.5 when we have a clearer definition of what p-mechanical states are.\n3. p-Mechanics: Statics\nWe define p-mechanical observables to be convolutions on the Heisenberg group.\nThe next subsection describes their multiplication and commutator as well as their\nquantum and classical representations. The Berezin quantisation in the form of\na wavelet transform is considered in subsection 3.2. This is developed in subsection 3.3 into a construction of p-observables out of either quantum or classical ones.\np-Mechanical states are introduced in subsection 3.4, as functionals on the set of\nobservables, which come in two forms: kernels and elements of a Hilbert space.\n3.1. Observables in p-Mechanics, Convolutions and Commutators. In line\nwith the standard quantum theory we give the following definition:\nDefinition 3.1. [24, 26] Observables in p-mechanics (p-observables) are presented\nby operators on L2 (Hn ).\nIt is important for subsection 3.4 to note that as the observables are operators\non a Hilbert space they form a C \u2217 -algebra [3, 11]. Actually we will need here1\nonly operators generated by convolutions on L2 (Hn ). Let dg be a left invariant\nmeasure [21, \u00a7 7.1] on Hn , which coincides with the standard Lebesgue measure on\nR2n+1 in the exponential coordinates (s, x, y). Then a function B1 from the linear\nspace L1 (Hn , dg) acts on B2 \u2208 L2 (Hn , dg) by a convolution as follows:\nZ\n(B1 \u2217 B2 )(g) = cn+1\nB1 (g1 ) B2 (g1\u22121 g) dg1\n(3.1)\nh\nHn\n\n= cn+1\nh\n\nZ\n\nHn\n\nB1 (gg1\u22121 ) B2 (g1 ) dg1 .\n\nwhere the constant ch has the value 1 in the units of action. Then cn+1\nhas units\nh\ninverse to dg. Thus the convolution B1 \u2217 B2 is measured in units which are the\n1More general operators are in use for a string-like version of p-mechanics, see [26, Sect 5.2.3].\n\n\f10\n\nA. BRODLIE AND V.

We can alternatively write the convolution of\ntwo functions on the Heisenberg group as\nZ\nB1 (h)\u03bbl (h)dhB2 (g)\n(3.2)\n(B1 \u2217 B2 )(g) = cn+1\nh\nHn\n\nwhere \u03bbl is as defined in equation (2.5). This form of convolution is shown to be\nuseful in subsection 3.4.\nThe composition of two convolution operators K1 and K2 with kernels B1 and B2\nhas the kernel defined by the same formula (3.1). This produces inner derivations\nDB of L1 (Hn ) by the commutator :\nDB : f 7\u2192 [B, f ] =\n=\n\nB\u2217f \u2212f \u2217B\nZ\n\u0001\nn+1\nB(g1 ) f (g1\u22121 g) \u2212 f (gg1\u22121 ) dg1 .\nch\n\n(3.3)\n\nHn\n\nSince we only consider observables which are convolutions on Hn we can extend a\nunitary representation \u03c1h of Hn to a \u2217-representation of L1 (Hn , dg) by the formula:\nZ\nB(g)\u03c1h (g)f (q, p) dg\n(3.4)\n[\u03c1h (B)f ](q, p) = cn+1\nh\nHn\n\n=\n\ncnh\n\nZ\n\nch\n\nR2n\n\nZ\n\nB(s, x, y)e\n\n\u22122\u03c0ihs\n\nR\n\n!\n\nds e\n\n\u22122\u03c0i(qx+py)\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nh\nh\nf q \u2212 y, p + x dx dy.\n2\n2\n\nThe last formula in the Schr\u00f6dinger representation defines for h 6= 0 a pseudodifferential operator [12, 16, 37] on L2 (Rn ) (2.15), which are known to be quantum\nobservables in the Weyl quantisation. For representations \u03c1(q,p) (2.16) the expression analogous to (3.4) defines an operator of multiplication on O0 (2.18) by the\nFourier transform of B(s, x, y):\nZ\n\u03c1(q,p) (B) = B\u0302 (0, q, p) = cn+1\nB(s, x, y)e\u22122\u03c0i(qx+py) ds dx dy,\n(3.5)\nh\nHn\n\nwhere the direct \u02c6 and inverse \u02c7 Fourier transforms are defined by the formulae:\nZ\nZ\n\u22122\u03c0iuv\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\nf\u02c6(v)e2\u03c0ivu dv.\nf (u)e\ndu\nand\nf (u) = (f )\u02c7(u) =\nf (v) =\nRm\n\nRm\n\nFor reasons discussed in subsections 2.2 and 4.1 we regard the functions (3.5) on\nO0 as classical observables. Again both the representations \u03c1h (B) and \u03c1(q,p) (B) are\nmeasured in the same units as the function B.\nFrom (3.4) it follows that \u03c1h (B) for a fixed h 6= 0 depends only from B\u0302s (h, x, y)-\nthe partial Fourier transform s \u2192 h of B(s, x, y).

It is commonly accepted that the method\nof orbits is the mathematical side of geometric quantisation [40]. Our derivation\nof the Moyal brackets in terms of orbits shows that deformation and geometric\nquantisations are closely connected and both are not very far from the original\nquantisation of Heisenberg and Schr\u00f6dinger. Yet one more close relative can be\nidentified as the Berezin quantisation [6], see the next subsection.\nRemark 3.2. The expression (3.7) vanishes for h = 0 as can be expected from\nthe commutativity of representations (2.16). Thus it does not produce anything\ninteresting on O0 , that supports the common negligence to this set.\nSumming up, p-mechanical observables, i.e. convolutions on L2 (Hn ) are transformed\n(1) by representations \u03c1h (2.9) into quantum observables (3.4) with the Moyal\nbracket (3.7) between them;\n(2) by representations \u03c1(q,p) (2.16) into classical observables (3.5).\nWe haven't got a meaningful bracket on the set of classical observables yet, this\nwill be done in Section 4.1.\n3.2. Berezin Quantisation and Wavelet Transform. There is the following\nconstruction, known as the Berezin quantisation, which allows us to assign a function to an operator (observable) and an operator to a function. The scheme is\nbased on the construction of coherent states, which can be derived from different sources [29, 34]. We prefer the group-theoretic origin of Perelomov coherent\nstates [34] in this section we use the coherent states in F2 (Oh ) defined in equation (2.23). Later in this paper we construct a more general system of coherent\nstates independent of a Hilbert space. Following [6] we introduce a covariant symbol a(g) of an operator A on F2 (Oh ) by the simple expression:\na(g) = hAfg , fg i ,\n\n(3.8)\n\ni.e. we get a map from the linear space of operators on F2 (Oh ) to a linear space of\nfunctions on Hn . A map in the opposite direction assigns to a function \u0103(g) on Hn\na linear operator A on F2 (Oh ) by the formula\nZ\n\u25e6\nn+1\na (g)Pg dg,\nA = ch\nwhere Pg is the projection Pg f = hf, fg i fg . (3.9)\nHn\n\u25e6\n\nThe function a (g) is called the contravariant symbol of the operator A (3.9).\nThe co- and contravariant symbols of operators are defined through the coherent\nstates, in fact both types of symbols are realisations [25, \u00a7 3.1] of the direct (2.25)\n\n\f12\n\nA. BRODLIE AND V. V. KISIL\n\nand inverse (2.24) wavelet transforms. Let us define a representation \u03c1bh of the\ngroup Hn \u00d7 Hn in the space B(F2 (Oh )) of operators on F2 (Oh ) by the formula:\n\u03c1bh (g1 , g2 ) : A 7\u2192 \u03c1h (g1\u22121 )A\u03c1h (g2 ),\n\nwhere g1 , g2 \u2208 Hn .\n\n(3.10)\n\nAccording to the scheme from [25] for any state l0 on B(F2 (Oh )) we get a wavelet\ntransform Wl0 : B(F2 (Oh )) \u2192 C (Hn \u00d7 Hn ):\nWl0 : A 7\u2192 \u0103(g1 , g2 ) = h\u03c1bh (g1 , g2 )A, l0 i .\n\n(3.11)\n\nThe important particular case is given by l0 defined through the vacuum vector\nf0 (2.19) by the formula hA, l0 i = hAf0 , f0 i. Then the wavelet transform (3.11) produces the covariant presymbol \u0103(g1 , g2 ) of operator A. Its restriction a(g) = \u0103(g, g)\nto the diagonal D of Hn \u00d7 Hn is exactly [25] the Berezin covariant symbol (3.8)\nof A. Such a restriction to the diagonal is done without a loss of information due\nto holomorphic properties of \u0103(g1 , g2 ) [4].\nAnother important example of the state l0 is given by the trace:\nZ\nhA, l0 i = tr A = hn\n(3.12)\nAf(x,y) , f(x,y) F (O ) dx dy,\nR2n\n\nh\n\n2\n\nwhere coherent states f(x,y) are again defined in (2.23). The operators \u03c1bh (g, g)\nfrom the diagonal D of Hn \u00d7 Hn trivially act on the wavelet transform (3.11)\ngenerated by the trace (3.12) since the trace is invariant under \u03c1bh (g, g). According\nto the general scheme we can consider the reduced wavelet transform [25] on the\nhomogeneous space Hn \u00d7 Hn /D instead of the entire group Hn \u00d7 Hn . The space\nHn \u00d7 Hn /D is isomorphic to Hn with an embedding Hn \u2192 Hn \u00d7 Hn given by\ng 7\u2192 (g; 0). Furthermore the centre Z of Hn acts trivially in the representation \u03c1bh\nas usual. Thus the only essential part of Hn \u00d7 Hn /D in the wavelet transform is the\nhomogeneous space \u03a9 = Hn /Z. A Borel section s : \u03a9 \u2192 Hn \u00d7 Hn in the principal\nbundle G \u2192 \u03a9 can be defined as s(x, y) 7\u2192 ((0, x, y); (0, 0, 0)). We got the reduced\nrealisation Wr of the wavelet transform (3.11) in the form:\nWr : A 7\u2192 \u0103r (x, y) =\n\n=\n=\n\nh\u03c1bh (s(x, y))A, l0 i\n\ntr (\u03c1h ((0, x, y)\u22121 )A)\nZ\nhn\n\u03c1h ((0, x, y)\u22121 )Af(x\u2032 ,y\u2032 ) , f(x\u2032 ,y\u2032 )\nR2n\n\n=\n\nhn\n\nZ\n\nAf(x\u2032 ,y\u2032 ) , f(x,y)\u2217(x\u2032 ,y\u2032 )\n\nR2n\n\nF2 (Oh )\n\n(3.13)\nF2 (Oh )\n\ndx\u2032 dy \u2032 .\n\ndx\u2032 dy \u2032\n(3.14)\n\nThe formula (3.13) is the principal ingredient of the inversion formula for the\nHeisenberg group [12, Chap. 1, (1.60)], [38, Chap. 1, Th. 2.7], which reconstructs\nthe kernel of convolution B(g) out of operators \u03c1h (B).

We will use them later in Example 3.7.\n3.3. From Classical and Quantum Observables to p-Mechanics. It is commonly accepted that we can not deal with quantum mechanics directly and thus\nclassical dynamics serve as an unavoidable intermediate step. The passage from\nclassical observables to quantum ones-known as a quantisation-is a huge field\nwith many concurring approaches (geometric, deformation, Weyl, Berezin, etc.\nquantisations) each having its own merits and demerits. Similarly one has to construct p-mechanical observables starting from classical or quantum ones by some\nprocedure (should it be named \"p-mechanisation\"?), which we are about to describe\nnow.\nThe transition from a p-mechanical observable to a classical one is given by the\nformula (3.5), which in turn is a realisation of the inverse wavelet transform (2.24):\nZ\nn+1\n\u03c1(q,p) B = B\u0302 (0, q, p) = ch\nB(s, x, y)e\u22122\u03c0i(qx+py) ds dx dy.\n(3.16)\nHn\n\nJust like in the case of quantisation the classical image \u03c1(q,p) (B) (3.16) contains\nonly partial information about a p-observable B unless we make some additional\nassumptions. Let us start from a classical observable c(q, p) and try to construct the\ncorresponding p-observable. As follows from general considerations (see [25] and\nSection 2.3) we can partially invert formula (3.16) by the wavelet transform (2.25):\n\u010d(x, y) = [W0 c](x, y) = cv(0,0) , v(x,y) =\n\ncnh\n\nZ\n\nc(q, p)e2\u03c0i(qx+py) dq dp,\n\n(3.17)\n\nR2n\n\nwhere v(x,y) = \u03c1(q,p) v(0,0) = e\u22122\u03c0i(qx+py) .\nHowever the function \u010d(x, y) (3.17) is not defined on the entire of Hn . The natural\ndomain of \u010d(x, y) according to the construction of the reduced wavelet transform [25]\nis the homogeneous space \u03a9 = G/Z, where G = Hn and Z is its normal subgroup of\ncentral elements (s, 0, 0). Let s : \u03a9 \u2192 G be a Borel section in the principal bundle\nG \u2192 \u03a9, which is used in the construction of induced representations, see [21, \u00a7 13.1].\nFor the Heisenberg group [25, Ex. 4.3] it can be simply defined as s : (x, y) \u2208 \u03a9 7\u2192\n(0, x, y) \u2208 Hn . One can naturally transfer functions from \u03a9 to the image s(\u03a9) of\nthe map s in G. However the range s(\u03a9) of s has often (particularly for Hn ) a zero\nHaar measure in G. Probably two simplest possible ways out are:\n\n\f14\n\nA. BRODLIE AND V. V. KISIL\n\n(1) To increase the \"weight\" of function c\u0303(s, x, y) vanishing outside of the range\ns(\u03a9) of s by a suitable Dirac delta function on the subgroup Z. For the\nHeisenberg group this can be done, for example, by the map:\nE : \u010d(x, y) 7\u2192 c\u0303(s, x, y) = \u03b4(s)\u010d(x, y),\n\n(3.18)\n\nwhere \u010d(x, y) is given by the inverse wavelet (Fourier) transform (3.17). As\nwe will see in Proposition 3.6 this is related to the Weyl quantisation and\nthe Moyal brackets.\n(2) To extend the function \u010d(x, y) to the entire group G by a tensor product\n2\nwith a suitable function on Z, for example e\u2212s :\n2\n\n\u010d(x, y) 7\u2192 c\u0303(s, x, y) = e\u2212s \u010d(x, y).\n\nIn order to get the correspondence principle between classical and quantum mechanics (cf. Example 2.2) the function on Z has to satisfy some\nadditional requirements. For Hn it should vanish for s \u2192 \u00b1\u221e, which is\n2\nfulfilled for both e\u2212s and \u03b4(s) from the previous item. In this way we\nget infinitely many essentially different quantisations with non-equivalent\ndeformed Moyal brackets between observables.\nThere are other more complicated possibilities not mentioned here, which can be of\nsome use if some additional information or assumptions are used to extend functions\nfrom \u03a9 to G. We will focus here only on the first \"minimalistic\" approach from the\ntwo listed above.\nExample 3.5.

In this subsection we introduce states to p-mechanics\n- these are positive linear functionals on the C \u2217 -algebra [3, 11] of p-mechanical\nobservables (cf. subsection 3.1). According to the GNS construction for a general\nC \u2217 -algebra [3, \u00a7 1.6]\n\u2022 an arbitrary state could be decomposed as a linear combination of the pure\nstates; and\n\u2022 the pure states correspond to irreducible representations.\nSince irreducible representations of L1 (Hn ) are given by Theorem 2.1 and are associated in p-mechanics with quantum and classical pictures then the pure states in\np-mechanics also corresponds to quantum and classical states. We give here several\nequivalent descriptions of these states.\nFor each h 6= 0 (the quantum case) we give two equivalent forms of states: the\nfirst form we give is as elements of a Hilbert space, the second is as integration with\nan appropriate kernel. For h = 0 (the classical case) we provide only one form of\nstates, that is as integration with an appropriate kernel since the second one is not\nessentially different from the former.\nDefinition 3.8.

Thus we collect them\ntogether under the following definition.\nDefinition 3.12. [9] We denote the set of kernels corresponding to the elements\nin Hh as Lh .\nNow we introduce (q, p)-states in p-mechanics, which correspond to classical\nstates, they are again functionals on the C \u2217 -algebra of p-mechanical observables.\nPure states in classical mechanics evaluate observables at particular points of phase\nspace, they can be realised as kernels \u03b4(q \u2212 q \u2032 , p \u2212 p\u2032 ) for fixed q, p in phase space,\nthat is\nZ\nF (q, p)\u03b4(q \u2212 q \u2032 , p \u2212 p\u2032 ) dq \u2032 dp\u2032 = F (q, p).\n(3.34)\nR2n\n\nWe now give the p-mechanical equivalent of pure classical states.\n\nDefinition 3.13. [9] A (q, p)-pure state is defined to be the set of functionals,\nk(0,q,p) , for fixed (q, p) \u2208 R2n which act on observables by\nZ\nB(s, x, y)e\u22122\u03c0i(qx+py) dx dy.\n(3.35)\nk(0,q,p) (B(s, x, y)) =\nHn\n\nEach classical pure state k(0,q,p) is defined entirely by its kernel l(0,q,p)\nl(0,q,p) = e\u22122\u03c0i(qx+py) .\nBy equation (3.16) we have\nZ\nB(s, x, y)e\u22122\u03c0i(qx+py) ds dx dy = F (q, p)\n\n(3.36)\n\n(3.37)\n\nHn\n\nwhere F is the classical observable corresponding to B (using the relation exhibited\nin subsection 3.3), hence when we apply state k(0,q,p) to a p-mechanical observable\n\n\fOBSERVABLES AND STATES p-MECHANICS\n\n19\n\nwe get the value of its classical counterpart at the point (q, p) of phase space.\nWe introduce the map S0 which maps classical pure state kernels to p-mechanical\nclassical pure state kernels\n\u02c6 y).\nS0 (\u03be(q, p)) = \u03be(x,\nThis equation is almost identical to the relation in equation (3.28). The kernels\nl(0,q,p) = e\u22122\u03c0i(qx+py) , are the Fourier transforms of the delta functions \u03b4(q \u2212 q \u2032 , p \u2212\np\u2032 ), hence pure (q, p) states are just the image of pure classical states.\nMixed states, as used in statistical mechanics [15], are linear combinations of\npure states. In p-mechanics (q, p) mixed states are defined in the same way.\nDefinition 3.14. [9] Define L0 , to be the space of all linear combinations of (q, p)\npure state kernels l(0,q,p) , that is the set of all kernels corresponding to (q, p) mixed\nstates.\nThe map S0 exhibits the same relations on mixed states as pure states due\nto the linearity of the Fourier transform. Note that if we consider the map S0 as\nmapping from functional to functional, that is going from the dual space of classical\nobservables on O0 to the dual space of the set of p-mechanical observables then it\nis the adjoint of \u03c1(q,p) .\nRemark 3.15. The above description of classical states corresponds to quantum\nstates defined through their kernels (3.32). It is possible to define classical states\nthrough vector in the Hilbert space L2 (O0 ) as well. Indeed a classical observable\nB(q, p) acts on L2 (O0 ) by multiplication. Then a vector v(q, p) \u2208 L2 (O0 ) defines\nthe state by the natural formula B(q, p) 7\u2192 hB(q, p)v(q, p), v(q, p)i. This permits\nquantum superpositions of states while the dynamics of observables is governed by\nthe classical Hamilton equation (4.11).\nIn accordance with the general theory of C \u2217 -algebras mentioned in the beginning\nof this subsection we could now describe a general p-mechanical state:\nProposition 3.16. An arbitrary p-mechanical state is a superposition of quantum h-states given by Definition 3.9 and classical (q, p)-states described in Definition 3.13.\nConsequently a comprehensive study of p-mechanical states, notably their dynamics, could be done through this decomposition. The various relations between\np, h, and (q, p)-states could be derived from Figure 2. Indeed since all types of\nstates form the dual spaces to the corresponding spaces of observables, the reversion of arrows on Figure 2 provides the maps between states through the adjoint\noperators to \u03c1h , \u03c10 , Wr , W0 , E, Qh , Ch\u21920 . The adjoint operator to the wavelet\ntransform Wr was identified with the inverse wavelet transform in [25].\nWe conclude this section by the following result describing relations between\neigenvectors in F2 and their images under Sh\nTheorem 3.17. [9] For a p-observable B \u2208 L1 (Hn ) and f1 \u2208 F2 (Oh ), \u03c1h (B)f1 =\n\u03bbf1 , if and only if for v1 (s, x, y) = Sh f1 = e2\u03c0ihs f\u02c61 (x, y) \u2208 Hh\nhB \u2217 v1 , v2 i = \u03bbhv1 , v2 i\nholds for all v2 \u2208 Hh .\n\n\f20\n\nA. BRODLIE AND V. V. KISIL\n\n4. p-Mechanics: Dynamics\nWe introduce the p-mechanical brackets which fulfil all essential physical requirements and have a non-trivial classical representation coinciding with the Poisson\nbrackets. A consistent p-mechanical dynamic equation for observables is given in\nsubsection 4.1. In subsection 4.2 we give two equivalent dynamic equations for\np-mechanical states. Symplectic automorphisms of the Heisenberg groups produce\nsymplectic symmetries of p-mechanical, quantum, and classical dynamics in subsection 4.4.\n4.1. p-Mechanical Brackets and Dynamic Equation on Hn . Having observables as convolutions on Hn we need a dynamic equation for their evolution. To\nthis end we seek a time derivative generated by the observable associated with energy. The first candidate is the derivation coming from commutator (3.3). However\nthe straight commutator has at least two failures. The first failure is that it can't\nproduce any dynamics on O0 (2.18), see Remark 3.2. The second failure is due to\na mismatch in units: the p-mechanical energy, BH , is measured in units M L2 /T 2\nwhereas the time derivative should be measured in 1/T , that is the mismatch is in\nunits of action M L2 /T .\nFortunately, there is a possibility to fix both the above defects of the straight\ncommutator at the same time. Let us define a multiple A of a right inverse operator\nto the vector field S (2.3) on Hn by its actions on exponents-characters of the\ncentre Z \u2208 Hn :\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 2\u03c0 e2\u03c0ihs , if h 6= 0,\n(4.1)\nih\nSA = 4\u03c0 2 I,\nwhere Ae2\u03c0ihs =\n\uf8f3\n4\u03c0 2 s,\nif h = 0.\nAn alternative definition of A as a convolution with a distribution is given in [27].\nWe can extend A by linearity to the entire space L1 (Hn ). As a multiple of a\nright inverse to S the operator A is measured in T /(M L2 )-exactly that we need to\ncorrect the mismatch of units in the straight commutator. Thus we introduce [27]\na modified convolution operation \u22c6 on L1 (Hn ):\nB \u2032 \u22c6 B = (B \u2032 \u2217 B)A\n\n(4.2)\n\nand the associated modified commutator (p-mechanical brackets):\n{[B \u2032 , B]} = [B \u2032 , B]A = B \u2032 \u22c6 B \u2212 B \u22c6 B \u2032 .\n\n(4.3)\n\nObviously (4.3) is a bilinear antisymmetric form on the convolution kernels. It was\nalso demonstrated in [27] that the p-mechanical brackets satisfy the Leibniz and\nJacoby identities. They are all important for consistent dynamics [10] along with\nthe dimensionality condition given in the beginning of this subsection.\nFrom (3.4) one gets \u03c1h (AB) = 2\u03c0\nih \u03c1h (B) for h 6= 0. Consequently the modification of the commutator for h 6= 0 is only slightly different from the original one:\n\u03c1h {[B \u2032 , B]} =\n\n1\n[\u03c1h (B \u2032 ), \u03c1h (B)],\ni~\n\nwhere ~ =\n\nh\n6= 0.\n2\u03c0\n\n(4.4)\n\n\fOBSERVABLES AND STATES p-MECHANICS\n\n21\n\nThe integral representation of the modified commutator kernel becomes (cf. (3.7)):\nZ\n\n4\u03c0\nsin (\u03c0h(xy \u2032 \u2212 yx\u2032 )) B\u0302s\u2032 (h, x\u2032 , y \u2032 )B\u0302s (h, x \u2212 x\u2032 , y \u2212 y \u2032 ) dx\u2032 dy \u2032 ,\nh\n(4.5)\nwhere we may understand the expression under the integral as\n\u221e\n\u2032\n\u2032 2k\u22121\nX\n4\u03c0\n2(k\u22121) (xy \u2212 yx )\nsin (\u03c0h(xy \u2032 \u2212 yx\u2032 )) = 4\u03c0 2\n(4.6)\n(\u22121)k+1 (\u03c0h)\nh\n(2k \u2212 1)!\n\u2032\n\n{[B , B]}\u015d =\n\ncnh\n\nR2n\n\nk=1\n\nThis makes the operation (4.5) for h = 0 significantly distinct from the vanishing\nintegral (3.7). Indeed it is natural to assign the value 4\u03c0 2 (xy \u2032 \u2212 yx\u2032 ) to (4.6) for\nh = 0. Then the integral in (4.5) becomes the Poisson brackets for the Fourier\ntransforms of B \u2032 and B defined on O0 (2.18):\n\n\u2202 B\u0302 \u2032 (0, q, p) \u2202 B\u0302(0, q, p) \u2202 B\u0302 \u2032 (0, q, p) \u2202 B\u0302(0, q, p)\n\u2212\n.\n(4.7)\n\u2202q\n\u2202p\n\u2202p\n\u2202q\nThe same formula is obtained [27, Prop. 3.5] if we directly calculate \u03c1(q,p) {[B \u2032 , B]}\nrather than resolve the indeterminacy for h = 0 in (4.6). This means there is continuity in our construction at h = 0 which represents the correspondence principle\nbetween quantum and classical mechanics.\nWe have now arrived at the conclusion the Poisson brackets and the inverse of\nthe Planck constant 1/h have the same dimensionality because they are the image\nof the same object (anti-derivative (4.1)) under different representations (2.9) and\n(2.16) of the Heisenberg group.\nNote that functions X = \u03b4(s)\u03b4 (1) (x)\u03b4(y) and Y = \u03b4(s)\u03b4(x)\u03b4 (1) (y) (see (3.19)\nand (3.20)) on Hn are measured in units L and M L/T (inverse to x and y) correspondingly as respective derivatives of the dimensionless function \u03b4(s)\u03b4(x)\u03b4(y).\nThen the p-mechanical brackets {[X, *]} and {[Y, *]} with those functions have dimensionality of T /(M L) and 1/L correspondingly. Their representation \u03c1\u2217 {[X, *]} and\n\u03c1\u2217 {[Y, *]} (for both type of representations \u03c1h and \u03c1(q,p) ) are measured by L and\nM L2 /T and are just derivatives:\n\u2202\n\u2202\n,\n\u03c1\u2217 {[Y, *]} =\n.\n(4.8)\n\u03c1\u2217 {[X, *]} =\n\u2202p\n\u2202q\nThus \u03c1\u2217 {[X, *]} and \u03c1\u2217 {[Y, *]} are generators of shifts on both types of orbits Oh and\nO0 independent from h.\nSince the modified commutator (4.3) with a p-mechanical energy has the dimensionality 1/T -the same as the time derivative-we introduce the dynamic equation\nfor an observable B(s, x, y) on Hn based on that modified commutator as follows\ndB\n= {[B, BH ]} .\n(4.9)\ndt\nRemark 4.1. It is a general tendency to make a Poisson bracket or quantum commutator out of any two observables and say that they form a Lie algebra. However\nthere is a physical meaning to do that if at least one of the two observables is an\nenergy, coordinate or momentum: in these cases the bracket produces the time\nderivative (4.9) or corresponding shift generators (4.8) of the other observable.\n\u03c1(q,p) {[B \u2032 , B]} =\n\nA simple consequence of the previous consideration is that the p-dynamic equation (4.9) is reduced\n\n\f22\n\nA.

We now go on to show how p-mechanical\nstates evolve with time. We first show how the elements of Lh , for all h \u2208 R\nevolve with time and that this time evolution agrees with the time evolution of\np-observables. In doing this we show that for the particular case of L0 the time\nevolution is the same as classical states under the Liouville equation. Then we\nshow how the elements of Hh evolve with time and prove that they agree with the\nSchr\u00f6dinger picture of motion in quantum mechanics. Before we can do any of this\nwe need to give the definition of a Hermitian convolution.\nDefinition 4.2. [9] We call a p-mechanical observable B Hermitian if it corresponds\nto a Hermitian convolution, that is for any functions f1 , f2 on the Heisenberg group\nZ\n\nHn\n\n(B \u2217 f1 )(g)f2 (g)dg =\n\nZ\n\nHn\n\nf1 (g)(B \u2217 f2 )(g)dg.\n\nIf a p-observable B is Hermitian then B(g) = B(g \u22121 ), this is the result of a trivial\ncalculation. From now on we denote B(g \u22121 ) as B \u2217 . For our purposes we just need\nto assume that the distribution or function, B, corresponding to the observable is\nreal and B(s, x, y) = B(\u2212s, \u2212x, \u2212y).\nDefinition 4.3.

We now give a\nCorollary to show that the time evolution of p-mechanical states in Hh , h \u2208 R \\ {0}\nis the same as the time evolution of quantum states.\nCorollary 4.7. [9] If we have a system with energy BH (assumed to be Hermitian)\nand an arbitrary state v = Sh f = e2\u03c0ihs f\u02c6(x, y) (assuming h 6= 0) then for any\nobservable B(t; s, x, y)\nd\nd\nhB \u2217 v(t), v(t)iHh = h\u03c1h (B)f (t), f (t)iF2 (Oh ) .\ndt\ndt\n1\nWhere df\ndt = ih \u03c1h (BH )f (this is just the usual Schr\u00f6dinger equation).\nProof.

A simple application of the representation theory yields the\nfollowing \"no-go\" results equivalent to the main conclusion of the paper [36]:\n\n\fOBSERVABLES AND STATES p-MECHANICS\n\n25\n\nTheorem 4.8. If the Hamiltonian of a p-mechanical system is given by a convolution operator then there is no mixing between quantum and classical states during\nthe induced evolution.\nObviously, this results essentially relies on the assumption that the Hamiltonian\nis a convolution operator. Examples of mixing for quantum and classic states for\nmore general Hamiltonians will be discussed somewhere else.\n4.3. The p-Mechanical Interaction Picture. In the Schr\u00f6dinger picture, time\ndl\nevolution is governed by the states and their equations dv\ndt = ABH \u2217v dt = {[BH , l]} .\nIn the Heisenberg picture, time evolution is governed by the observables and the\nequation dB\ndt = {[B, BH ]} . In the interaction picture we divide the time dependence between the states and the observables. This is suitable for systems with a\nHamiltonian of the form BH = BH0 + BH1 where BH0 is time independent. The\ninteraction picture has many uses in perturbation theory [30].\nLet a p-mechanical system have the Hamiltonian BH = BH0 + BH1 where BH0\nis time independent. We first describe the interaction picture for elements of Hh .\nDefine exp(tABH0 ) as the operator on Hh which is the exponential of the operator\nof convolution by tABH0 . Now if B is an observable let\nB\u0303 = exp(tABH0 )B exp(\u2212tABH0 )\n\n(4.19)\n\nIf v \u2208 Hh , define \u1e7d = (exp(\u2212tABH0 ))v, then we get\nd\n\u1e7d\ndt\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nd\n(4.20)\n(exp(\u2212tABH0 )v)\ndt\n\u2212ABH0 \u2217 \u1e7d + exp(\u2212tABH0 )(A(BH0 + BH1 ) \u2217 v)\n\u2212ABH0 \u2217 \u1e7d + ABH0 \u2217 exp(\u2212tABH0 )v + exp(\u2212tABH0 )ABH1 v\n(exp(\u2212tABH0 )ABH1 exp(tABH0 ))(\u1e7d)\n\nNow we describe the interaction picture for a state defined by a kernel l. Define\n \u0303\nl = e\u2212t{[BH0 ,*]} l = exp(\u2212tABH0 )l exp(+tABH0 )\nthen\ndl\u0303\ndt\n\n=\n\nl + exp(\u2212tABH0 ) {[BH0 + BH1 , l]} exp(tABH0 ) \u2212 l\u0303 \u2217 ABH0\nABH0 \u2217  \u0303\n\n=\n\nexp(\u2212tABH0 ) {[BH1 , l]} exp(tABH0 )\n\n=\n=\n\nexp(\u2212tABH0 )(A(BH1 \u2217 exp(tABH0 )l\u0303 exp(\u2212tABH0 )\n\n\u2212 exp(tABH0 )l\u0303 exp(\u2212tABH0 ) \u2217 BH1 )) exp(tABH0 )\nio\nnh\nexp(\u2212tABH0 )BH1 exp(tABH0 ), l\u0303\n\n(4.21)\n\nThis shows us how interaction states evolve with time, while the observables evolve\nby (4.19). Note that if we take BH0 = BH we have the Heisenberg picture, while\nif we take BH1 = BH we have the Schr\u00f6dinger picture. The interaction picture is\nvery useful in studying the forced harmonic oscillator as will be shown in subsection\n5.4.\n\n\f26\n\nA. BRODLIE AND V. V.

Symplectic Invariance from Automorphisms of Hn . Let A : R2n \u2192 R2n\nbe a linear symplectomorphism [2, \u00a7 41], [12, \u00a7 4.1], i.e. a map defined by the 2n\u00d72n\nmatrix:\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012 \u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\nx\na b\nx\nax + by\nA:\n7\u2192\n=\ny\nc d\ny\ncx + dy\npreserving the symplectic form (2.2):\n\u03c9 (A(x, y); A(x\u2032 , y \u2032 )) = \u03c9(x, y; x\u2032 , y \u2032 ).\n\n(4.22)\n\nAll such transformations form the symplectic group Sp(n). It follows from the\nidentities (4.22) and (2.1) that the linear transformation \u03b1 : Hn \u2192 Hn such that\n\u03b1(s, x, y) = (s, A(x, y)) is an automorphism of Hn . Let us also denote by \u03b1\u0303 = \u03b1\u0303A\na unitary transformation of L2 (Hn ) in the form\n\u221a\n\u03b1\u0303(f )(s, x, y) = det Af (s, A(x, y)),\nf\nwhich is well defined [12, \u00a7 4.2] on the double cover Sp(n)\nof the group Sp(n). The\ncorrespondence A 7\u2192 \u03b1\u0303A is a linear unitary representation of the symplectic group\nin L2 (Hn ). One can also check the intertwining property\n\u03bbl(r) (g) \u25e6 \u03b1\u0303 = \u03b1\u0303 \u25e6 \u03bbl(r) (\u03b1(g))\n\n(4.23)\n\n\u03b1\u2217 (B1 ) \u22c6 \u03b1\u2217 (B2 ) = \u03b1\u2217 (B1 \u22c6 B2 ).\n\n(4.24)\n\nn\n\nfor the left (right) regular representations (2.5) of H .\nBecause \u03b1 is an automorphism of Hn the map \u03b1\u2217 : B(g) 7\u2192 B(\u03b1(g)) is an\nautomorphism of the convolution algebra L1 (Hn ) with the multiplication \u2217 (3.1),\ni.e. \u03b1\u2217 (B1 ) \u2217 \u03b1\u2217 (B2 ) = \u03b1\u2217 (B1 \u2217 B2 ). Moreover \u03b1\u2217 commutes with the antiderivative A (4.1), thus \u03b1\u0303 is an automorphism of L1 (Hn ) with the modified multiplication \u22c6 (4.2) as well, that is\n\n\fOBSERVABLES AND STATES p-MECHANICS\n\n27\n\nBy the linearity we can extend the intertwining property (4.23) to the convolution\noperator K as follows:\n\u03b1\u2217 K \u25e6 \u03b1\u0303 = \u03b1\u0303 \u25e6 K.\nn\n\n(4.25)\nn\n\nSince \u03b1 is automorphism of H it fixes the unit e of H and its differential\nd\u03b1 : hn \u2192 hn at e is given by the same matrix as \u03b1 in the exponential coordinates.\nObviously d\u03b1 is an automorphism of the Lie algebra hn . By the duality between\nhn and h\u2217n we obtain the adjoint map d\u03b1\u2217 : h\u2217n \u2192 h\u2217n defined by the expression\nd\u03b1\u2217 : (h, q, p) 7\u2192 (h, At (q, p)),\n\n(4.26)\n\nwhere At is the transpose of A. Obviously d\u03b1\u2217 preserves any orbit Oh (2.7) and\nmaps the orbit O(q,p) (2.8) to OAt (q,p) .\nIdentity (4.26) indicates that both representations \u03c1h and (\u03c1h \u25e6 \u03b1)(s, x, y) =\n\u03c1h (s, A(x, y)) for h 6= 0 correspond to the same orbit Oh . Thus they should be\nequivalent, i.e. there is an intertwining operator UA : F2 (Oh ) \u2192 F2 (Oh ) such that\nUA\u22121 \u03c1h UA = \u03c1h \u25e6 \u03b1. Then the correspondence \u03c3 : A 7\u2192 UA is a linear unitary repref\nsentation of the double cover Sp(n)\nof the symplectic group called the metaplectic\nrepresentation [12, \u00a7 4.2]. Thus we have\n\nProposition 4.9. [26] The p-mechanical brackets are invariant under the symplectic automorphisms of Hn : {[\u03b1\u0303B1 , \u03b1\u0303B2 ]} = \u03b1\u0303 {[B1 , B2 ]}. Consequently the dynamic\nequation (4.9) has symplectic symmetries which are reduced\n\n(1) by \u03c1h , h 6= 0 on Oh (2.7) to the metaplectic representation in quantum\nmechanics;\n(2) by \u03c1(q,p) on O0 (2.18) to the symplectic symmetries of classical mechanics [2, \u00a7 38].\nCombining intertwining properties of all three components (3.23) in the Weyl\nquantisation we get\nCorollary 4.10. [26] The Weyl quantisation Qh (3.22) is the intertwining operator\nbetween classical and metaplectic representations.\nThe two equations for the time evolution of states (4.12), (4.15) are both invariant\nunder the symplectic automorphisms of Hn . The invariance of equation (4.15) is a\nconsequence of (4.24) while the invariance of (4.12) follows from the invariance of\nthe p-mechanical brackets.\n4.5. Coherent States. The coherent states defined in section 2.3 all had a function\nsupported at (0, 0) \u2208 R2n as their classical limit, rather than being supported\naround different classical states (q, p). In this section we rectify this problem by\nintroducing an overcomplete system of vectors in Hh through a representation of\nHn . The states which correspond to these vectors are an overcomplete system of\ncoherent states for each h 6= 0. We then show that these vectors correspond to a\nsystem of kernels in Lh , whose limit is the (q, p) pure state kernels.\nInitially we need to introduce a vacuum vector in Hh .

For one account of the unforced harmonic\noscillator see [27], the account we give here is slightly different.\nLet the p-mechanical energy function of a harmonic oscillator be as obtained in\nExamples 3.5 and 3.7:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n2\n(2)\n(2)\n(5.1)\nBH (s, x, y) = \u2212 2 m\u03c9 \u03b4(s)\u03b4 (x)\u03b4(y) + \u03b4(s)\u03b4(x)\u03b4 (y) ,\n8\u03c0\nm\nThen the p-dynamic equation (4.9) on Hn is\n\u0013\nn \u0012\nX\nd\n1\n\u2202\n\u2202\nB(t; s, x, y).\n\u2212 m\u03c9 2 yj\nB(t; s, x, y) =\nxj\ndt\nm \u2202yj\n\u2202xj\nj=1\n\n(5.2)\n\nSolutions to the above equations are well known to be rotations in each of the\n(xj , yj ) planes given by:\n\u0011\n\u0010\nx\nsin(\u03c9t) + y cos(\u03c9t) .\n(5.3)\nB(t; s, x, y) = B0 s, x cos(\u03c9t) \u2212 m\u03c9y sin(\u03c9t),\nm\u03c9\n\nSince the dynamics on L2 (Hn ) is given by a symplectic linear transformation of\nHn its Fourier transform (2.10) to L2 (h\u2217n ) will be the adjoint symplectic linear\ntransformations of orbits Oh and O0 in h\u2217n , see Figure 4.\nThe representations \u03c1h transform the energy function BH (5.1) into the operator\n1\n1\n(m\u03c9 2 Q2 + P 2 ),\n(5.4)\n8\u03c0 2\nm\nwhere Q = d\u03c1h (X) and P = d\u03c1h (Y ) are defined in (2.12).

To conclude our description of the\nunforced harmonic oscillator we give an alternative form of the Hamiltonian which\nwill be of use when considering the forced harmonic oscillator.\nDefinition 5.1.

It\nis important to note that these states are orthogonal under the Hh inner product\ndefined in equation (3.26).\n5.2. The p-Mechanical Forced Oscillator: The Solution and Relation to\nClassical Mechanics. The classical forced oscillator has been studied in great\ndepth for a long time - for a description of this see [17] and [13]. The quantum\ncase has also been heavily researched - see for example [33, Sect 14.6], [32]. Of\ninterest in the quantum case has been the use of coherent states, this is described\nin [34]. Here we extend these approaches to give a unified quantum and classical\nsolution of the problem based on the p-mechanical approach. In [9] there is a more\nin depth description of this example and a description of the p-mechanical scattering\nmatrix.\nThe classical Hamiltonian for a harmonic oscillator of frequency \u03c9 and mass m\nbeing forced by a real function of a real variable z(t) (measured in units ML\nT 2 ) is\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\nm\u03c9 2 q 2 + p2 \u2212 z(t)q.\nH(t, q, p) =\n2\nm\n\n\f32\n\nA.

A Periodic Force and Resonance. In classical mechanics the forced oscillator is of particular interest if we take the external force to be z(t) = Z0 cos(\u03a9t)\n[17], that is the oscillator is being driven by a harmonic force of constant frequency\n\u03a9 and constant amplitude Z0 . By a simple calculation we have these results for\n\u03a9 6= \u03c9\nZ t\n2\n[\u03a9 cos(\u03a9t) cos(\u03c9t) + \u03c9 sin(\u03a9t) sin(\u03c9t)] (5.14)\ncos(\u03a9\u03c4 ) sin(\u03c9\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 =\n2\n(\u03a9 \u2212 \u03c9 2 )\n0\nZ\n\n0\n\nt\n\ncos(\u03a9\u03c4 ) cos(\u03c9\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 =\n\n2\n[\u2212\u03a9 sin(\u03a9t) cos(\u03c9t) + \u03c9 cos(\u03a9t) sin(\u03c9t)] (5.15)\n(\u03a92 \u2212 \u03c9 2 )\n\n\fOBSERVABLES AND STATES p-MECHANICS\n\n33\n\nWhen these are substituted into (5.12) we see that in p-mechanics using a periodic force the p-mechanical solution is the flow of the unforced oscillator multiplied\nby an exponential term which is also periodic. However this exponential term becomes infinitely large as \u03a9 comes close to \u03c9. If we substitute (5.14) and (5.15)\ninto (5.13) we obtain a classical flow which is periodic but with a singularity as\n\u03a9 tends toward \u03c9. These two effects show a correspondence between classical and\np-mechanics. The integrals have a different form when \u03a9 = \u03c9\nZ\n\nt\n\n0\nZ t\n\ncos(\u03c9\u03c4 ) sin(\u03c9\u03c4 ) d\u03c4\n\n=\n\ncos(\u03c9\u03c4 ) cos(\u03c9\u03c4 ) d\u03c4\n\n=\n\n0\n\n1 \u2212 cos(2\u03c9t)\n4\u03c9\nt\n1\n+\nsin(2\u03c9t)\n2 4\u03c9\n\n(5.16)\n(5.17)\n\nNow when these new values are substituted into the p-mechanical solution (5.12)\nthe exponential term will expand without bound as t becomes large. When (5.16)\nand (5.17) are substituted into (5.13) the classical flow will also expand without\nbound - this is the effect of resonance.\n5.4. The Interaction Picture of the Forced Oscillator. We now use the interaction picture to get a better description of the p-mechanical forced oscillator.\nIn [9] we use a different approach to the interaction picture using the Hh states,\nhere we use the kernels. The p-mechanical forced oscillator Hamiltonian has the\nequivalent form\n\u0011 z(t)\n1 \u0010 +\na \u2217 a\u2212 + i\u03c9m2 \u03b4 (1) (s)\u03b4(x)\u03b4(y) \u2212\n(a\u2212 + a+ )\nBH =\n2m\n2\n(a+ and a\u2212 are the distributions defined in equations (5.8) and (5.9)).

So if the system starts in a coherent state it will remain in a coherent sate as time evolves. This result has been\nfound in a much simpler manner than the method used in [33, Sect. 14.6].\n6. In Conclusion: p-Mechanics and Contextuality\n\nThe presented construction of observables as (convolution) operators on L2 (Hn )\nand states as positive linear functionals on them naturally unites the quantum and\nclassical pictures of mechanics. Moreover the p-mechanical description of states\nthrough their kernels (3.32) and the Liouville-type equation (4.12) for the dynamics\nof these kernels is suitable for the contextual interpretation [18, 19, 28] of quantum\nmechanics.\nIndeed the main point of the contextual approach [18, 19] is that in a realistic\nmodel the total probability P (E12 ) of two disjoint events P (E1 ) and P (E2 ) should\nnot be calculated by a simplistic addition rule P (E12 ) = P (E1 ) + P (E2 ). The\ntypical example, when this formula fails, is the two slits experiment. However\nthe textbook conclusion that \"quantum particles do not have trajectories\" is not\nlegitimate in the contextual framework [20, 28].\nContextuality requires that probabilities of events should depend from the context of experiments. For example, the probabilities of an electron to pass the first\nslit could be either P (E1 |S1 ) or P (E1 |S12 ) depending correspondingly from the\ncontext S1 (only the first slit is open) or S12 (both slits are open). The similar\nnotations P (E2 |S1 ) or P (E2 |S12 ) are used for the second slit and in general:\nP (E1 |S1 ) 6= P (E1 |S12 ),\n\nand\n\nP (E2 |S2 ) 6= P (E2 |S12 ),\n\nThen instead of the wrong probabilities addition rule\n\nP (E12 |S12 ) = P (E1 |S1 ) + P (E2 |S2 )\n\n(6.1)\n\nP (E12 |S12 ) = P (E1 |S12 ) + P (E2 |S12 ).\n\n(6.2)\n\nthe true contextual addition of probabilities is:\n\n\fOBSERVABLES AND STATES p-MECHANICS\n\n35\n\nUsing some relations between contextual probabilities P (E1 |S1 ), P (E2 |S2 ), and\nP (E1 |S12 ), P (E2 |S12 ), which could be derived from a physical model, one can\nimprove the wrong formula (6.1) to the \"quantum addition\" of probabilities:\np\n(6.3)\nP (E12 |S12 ) = P (E1 |S1 ) + P (E2 |S2 ) + \u03b1 P (E1 |S1 )P (E2 |S2 ),\n\nwhere \u03b1 is a real number. The presence of the square root in (6.3) could be motivated by the consideration of dimensions. If |\u03b1| \u2264 1 one can identify \u03b1 = cos \u03c6 for\na quantum phase \u03c6 and this would be the standard superposition of states in quantum theory. In remaining cases |\u03b1| > 1 the formula (6.3) represents the hyperbolic\nversion of quantum theory [18].\nThe contextual calculus of probabilities in quantum mechanics does not require\na superposition of states as linear combinations of vectors in Hilbert space. Instead the outcome of combined experiments could be directly calculated from the\ncontextual probabilities in a way similar to (6.2). p-Mechanical equation (4.12)\nfor dynamics of states (i.e. corresponding contextual probabilities) describes the\ndynamics in a way similar to classical statistical mechanics. Therefore the combination of contextual probabilities and p-mechanical dynamics form a reliable model\nfor quantum phenomenons. This combination of two approaches requires further\nstudy.\nReferences\n1. S. Twareque Ali, J.-P. Antoine, J.-P. Gazeau, and U.A.
