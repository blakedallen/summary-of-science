One of the best examples of spinning dust comes from a HII region in the Perseus molecular\ncloud.

A new detection of excess emission at 31 GHz in the HII region\nRCW175 has been made. The most plausible explanation again comes\nfrom spinning dust. HII regions are a good place to look for spinning\ndust as long as accurate radio data spanning the \u223c 5 \u2212 100 GHz range is\navailable.\n\n1. Introduction\nAnomalous emission appears to be \"real\" i.e. there is an additional\ncomponent of diffuse Galactic microwave emission that is not traditional\nsynchrotron, free-free or thermal dust emissions (e.g. Davies et al. 2006).\nThe anomalous emission emits strongly in the frequency range \u223c 10 \u2212\n60 GHz and is strongly correlated with FIR dust. A number of physical\nmechanisms could be responsible for the anomalous emission including\nhard synchrotron, hot free-free emission, cold dust, magneto-dipole radiation, fullerenes, to name a few. However, so far, the best explanation for\nthe physical mechanism responsible for the anomalous emission appears to\nbe electro-dipole radiation from ultra-rapidly spinning dust grains, often\nreferred to as \"spinning dust\" (Draine & Lazarian 1998a,b).\n\n2. Why HII regions?\nHII regions may be a good place to look for anomalous emission.\nMost importantly, they are typically associated with large column densities of dust, and therefore emit a detectable spinning dust signal. Even\nthough they emit strong free-free emission from the warm ionized gas\n(Te \u2248 10000 K), this component can be quantified either by its welldefined spectrum (a power-law with a spectral index \u03b2f f = \u22120.15 \u00b1 0.05)\nor alternatively, from recombination lines (e.g. H\u03b1, RRLs) (Dickinson et\nal. 2003). Draine & Lazarian (1998b) considered six typical environments\n(CNM,WNM,WIM etc.) and they found that the the emissivity of spinning dust is not strongly dependent on the details of the environment,\nas shown in Fig. 1. There is of course a contrary argument regarding\nsmall grain destruction in the environments around hot starts that form\nHII regions, particularly the PAHs that could be spinning at fast rates.\nHowever, this is usually only in the central region of a compact HII region and the dense dust population in the surrounding material (which\nis usually not resolved by telescopes with beams >> arcmin) is typically\nnot strongly affected. It is interesting to note that the dust temperature\n\n1\n\n\fCMB Component Separation and the Physics of Foregrounds\n14-18 July 2008, Pasadena, California\nis typically 30-50 K, compared to the \u2248 18 K dust found in the diffuse\nISM.\n\nFigure 1: Model dust emissivities from Draine & Lazarian (1998) with previous\nobservational data, reproduced from Finkbeiner et al. (2004). Note how the\nspinning dust models for different environments (CNM, WNM, WIM etc.) peak\nin the range \u223c 20 \u2212 40 GHz and typically vary by only a factor of a few in\nemissivity.\n\n3. Detections from \"compact\" Galactic objects\nThe best two examples of spinning dust are the HII region G159.618.5 in the Perseus molecular cloud (Watson et al. 2005) and the dark\ncloud LDN1622 (Finkbeiner et al, 2002,2004; Casassus et al. 2006). Both\nof these show spectra that are consistent with canonical spinning dust\nmodels. Furthermore, LDN1622 shows a better morphological correlation\nwith the shorter wavelengths of IRAS (12/25 \u03bcm), as expected from the\nsmaller dust grains.\nOf the two spinning dust candidates of Finkbeiner et al. (2002), the\nstrongest candidate was initially LPH[96]201.663+1.643. Follow-up observations with the Cosmic Background Imager (CBI) showed that the flux\ndensity at 31 GHz was completely consistent with optically thin free-free\nemission. The original Finkbeiner et al. (2002) data at 5-10 GHz and\nthe CBI 31 GHz data point can still be fit by an anomalous component\nwith a very narrow spectrum (N. Ysard, priv. comm.). However, more\nrecent GBT 100 m observations (D. Finkbeiner, priv. comm.) could not\n\n2\n\n\fCMB Component Separation and the Physics of Foregrounds\n14-18 July 2008, Pasadena, California\n\nTable 1: Comparison of 100 \u03bcm dust emissivities for HII regions and cooler dust\nclouds, from data at or near 30 GHz.

(2005)\n\nreproduce the original Green Bank 5 \u2212 10 GHz data, suggesting that the\nearlier data were spurious.\nDickinson et al. (2007) observed 6 bright southern HII regions with the\nCBI at 31 GHz to search for anomalous emission. Using low frequency\ndata from the literature, a simple free-free power-law was fitted to the\nspectrum of each object. The 31 GHz flux density appeared to be slightly\nabove the simple free-free extrapolation. The average dust emissivity,\nrelative to the 100 \u03bcm map, was found to be 3.3 \u00b1 1.7 \u03bcK/(MJy/sr). This\nis significantly lower than values observed at high latitudes and other\nanomalous regions (Table 1). On the other hand, Scaife et al. (2007)\nobserved a sample of 16 HII regions with the Arc Minute Imager (AMI)\nat \u2248 15 GHz, and found no significant evidence for excess emission with\nmany regions emitting at < 1 \u03bcK/(MJy/sr).\n\n4. New detection of spinning dust in RCW175\nPreliminary results from the Very Small Array (VSA) Galactic\nplane survey at 33 GHz (Todorovic et al, in prep.) indicated that the\nRCW175 HII region was significantly brighter than expected from\nlower frequency surveys. It was re-observed with higher resolution\nwith the CBI at 31 GHz and a consistent flux density was measured\n(Dickinson et al. 2008). The integrated flux density spectrum of\nRCW175 is shown in Fig. 2. Best-fitting models for free-free and\nthermal dust emission are plotted along with a typical spinning dust\nmodel. The upper limit at 94 GHz from WMAP data is very important for the interpretation of the apparent excess since it effectively\nrules out significant contributed from thermal dust or optically thick\nfree-free emission, perhaps from an ultracompact HII region. The\nestimated column density from IRAS 100 \u03bcm maps gives a spinning\ndust emissivity that is consistent with the Draine & Lazarian (1998)\nmodels.\n\n3\n\n\fCMB Component Separation and the Physics of Foregrounds\n14-18 July 2008, Pasadena, California\n\nFigure 2: Integrated flux density spectrum for RCW175 (Dickinson et al. 2008).\nFilled circles represent data fitted by a power-law with fixed spectral index\n(dotted line) and a modified black-body with fixed emissivity (dashed line).\nThe Draine & Lazarian (1998b) CNM spinning dust spectrum (dot -dashed\nline) has been fitted to the 31/33 GHz data.\n\n5. Conclusion\nAnomalous emission has been observed at both high latitudes\nand from discrete Galactic objects. The best explanation is that it\nis due to spinning dust grains. One of the best examples of spinning\ndust is the HII region G159.6-18.5 in the Perseus molecular cloud.\nThere is also tentative evidence for excess emission from other HII\nregions. In particular, RCW175 has now been confirmed to have\nexcess emission at \u223c 30 GHz with spinning dust being a plausible\norigin. HII regions are good places to search for spinning dust emission, but accurately calibrated data covering the frequency range\n\u223c 5 \u2212 100 GHz is required.\nReferences\nCasassus, S., et al., 2006, ApJ, 639, 951\nDavies, R.D., et al., 2006, MNRAS, 370, 1125\nDickinson, C., Davies, R.D., Davis, R.J., 2003, MNRAS, 341, 369\nDickinson, C., et al., 2006, ApJ, 643, L111\nDickinson, C., et al., 2007, MNRAS, 379, 297\nDickinson, C., et al., 2008, ApJL, submitted (arXiv:0807.3985)\nDraine, B.T., Lazarian, A., 1998a, ApJ, 494, L19\nDraine, B.T., Lazarian, A., 1998b, ApJ, 508, 157\nFinkbeiner, D., et al., 2002, ApJ, 566, 898\nFinkbeiner, D., Langston, G.I., Minter, A.H., 2004, ApJ, 617, 350\nScaife, A., et al., 2007, MNRAS, 385, 809\nWatson, R.A., et al., 2005, ApJ, 624, L89\n\n4\n\n\f"}
