A variation of pure Hodge structure H of\nweight \u22121 on S induces a family of compact complex tori \u03c0 : J(H ) \u2192 S. Let\nCS denote the sheaf of continuous functions on S, OSan the sheaf of holomorphic\nfunctions on S, and J (H ) the sheaf of continuous sections of \u03c0 . The exact\nsequence\n0 \u2192 HZ \u2192 HC \u2297 CS /F 0 H \u2297OSan CS \u2192 J (H ) \u2192 0\nof sheaves of abelian groups on S induces a long exact sequence in cohomology.\nWriting clZ : H 0 (S, J (H )) \u2192 H 1 (S, HZ ) for the first connecting homomorphism,\nwe find that, to each continuous section \u03bd of \u03c0 , we can associate a cohomology\nclass clZ (\u03bd ) \u2208 H1 (S, HZ ).\nAssume now that j : S \u2192 S is an embedding of S as a Zariski open subset of\na complex manifold S [Sai96, Definition 1.4]. If U is an (analytic) open neighborhood of a point s \u2208 S(C), we can restrict clZ (\u03bd ) to U \u2229 S to obtain a class in\nH1 (U \u2229 S, HZ ). Taking the limit over all open neighborhoods U of s, we obtain a\nclass\n(1.1)\n\n\u03c3Z,s (\u03bd ) \u2208 colim H1 (U \u2229 S, HZ ).\ns\u2208U\n\nWe call this class the singularity of \u03bd at s, and we say that \u03bd is singular on S if\nthere exists a point s \u2208 S with a non-torsion singularity \u03c3Z,s (\u03bd ).\nIn this paper, we will study \u03c3Z,s (\u03bd ) when \u03bd is a normal function; that is, a\nhorizontal holomorphic section of \u03c0 . In fact, we will restrict our attention to\nadmissible normal functions which are normal functions satisfying a very restrictive (but, from the point of view of algebraic geometry, very natural) constraint on their local monodromy. These normal functions were systematically\nstudied by Saito in [Sai96].\nNow suppose X is a projective complex variety of dimension 2n with n an\ninteger. Let L be a very ample invertible sheaf on X, and let \u03b6 \u2208 HodgenZ (X) :=\nDate: October 31, 2018.\nKey words and phrases. Hodge Conjecture, Normal Functions, Mixed Hodge Modules.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nPATRICK BROSNAN, HAO FANG, ZHAOHU NIE, AND GREGORY PEARLSTEIN\n\nHn,n (X) \u2229 H2n (X, Z(n)) be a primitive Hodge class; that is, assume that c1 (L ) \u222a\nn\n\u03b6 = 0. Recall that the map p : H2n\nD (X, Z(n)) \u2192 HodgeZ (X) from Deligne cohomol2n\nogy to Hodge classes is surjective. To any \u03c9 \u2208 HD (X, Z(n)) such that p(\u03c9 ) = \u03b6 ,\none can associate a normal function \u03bd (\u03c9 , L ) on the complement |L | \u2212 X \u2228 of the\ndual variety X \u2228 in the complete linear system |L |. This function takes a point\nf \u2208 |L | \u2212 X \u2228 to the restriction of \u03c9 to H2n\nD (V ( f ), Z(n)) where V ( f ) denotes the\nzero locus of f . Since \u03b6 is primitive, \u03c9 |V ( f ) lands in J(H 2n\u22121 (V ( f ))(n)), a sub\u2032\ngroup of H2n\nD (V ( f ), Z(n)). Moreover, if \u03c9 is another Deligne cohomology class\n\u2032\nsuch that p(\u03c9 ) = \u03b6 , then \u03bd (\u03c9 , L ) is singular on |L | if and only if \u03bd (\u03c9 \u2032 , L ) is\nsingular (see \u00a74). We say that \u03b6 is singular on |L | if \u03bd (\u03c9 , |L |) is singular on\n|L | for some \u03c9 \u2208 H2n\nD (X, Z(n)) such that p(\u03c9 ) = \u03b6 .\nConjecture 1.2. Let X and L be as above. For every non-torsion primitive\nHodge class \u03b6 , there is an integer k such that \u03b6 is singular on |L k |.\nIn this paper, we prove the following result motivated by the work of Green\nand Griffiths [GG07].\nTheorem 1.3. Conjecture 1.2 holds (for every even dimensional X and every\nnon-torsion primitive middle dimensional Hodge class \u03b6 ) if and only if the\nHodge conjecture holds (for all smooth projective algebraic varieties).\nIn the paper of Green and Griffiths [GG07], an analogous result is stated.\nThe arguments of Green and Griffiths rely on R. Thomas's paper [Tho05] which\nshows that the Hodge conjecture is equivalent to the statement that every nontorsion Hodge class \u03b6 in an even dimension smooth projective complex variety\nX has non-zero restriction to some divisor D in X which is smooth outside of\nfinitely many nodes. Our proof of Theorem 1.3 does not use Thomas' result\nconcerning nodal hypersurfaces. It relies instead on the theory of admissible\nnormal functions and the \"Gabber decomposition theorem\" in Morihiko Saito's\ntheory of mixed Hodge modules [Sai89]. More importantly, the argument of\nGreen and Griffiths relies on Hironaka's resolution of singularities to modify\n|L k | so that X \u2228 becomes a normal crossing divisor. This makes the argument\nof Green and Griffiths somewhat less explicit than one would hope.\nWe have two intermediate results which may be particularly interesting\nin their own right. The first is Lemma 2.18 which gives a criterion for the\nintermediate extension functor j!\u2217 of [BBD82] to preserve the exactness of a\nsequence of mixed Hodge modules. The second is Theorem 5.2 which we call\nthe \"perverse weak Lefschetz.\" It is a relative weak Lefschetz for families of\nhypersurfaces.\nThe organization of this paper is as follows. In \u00a72, we study the general\nproperties of admissible normal functions and their singularities. In particular, we show that the singularity is always a Tate class which lies in the local\nintersection cohomology, a subgroup of the local cohomology. In \u00a73, we generalize Saito's definition of absolute Hodge cohomology slightly. In \u00a74, we introduce\nsome notation concerning the decomposition theorem of Beilinson-BernsteinDeligne-Gabber and Saito. In \u00a75, we prove the perverse weak Lefschetz theorem alluded to above and use it to compute the singularity of a normal function\nassociated to a primitive Hodge class (as in Conjecture 1.2) in terms of restriction of the Hodge class to a hyperplane. In \u00a76, we prove Theorem 1.3.\n\n\fNORMAL FUNCTIONS\n\n3\n\nThe last section, \u00a77, links our work directly to that of Green and Griffiths [GG07]. Doing this involves showing that singularities of admissible normal functions do not disappear after modification of the base. Unfortunately,\nwe have been unable to prove that this is the case for all admissible normal\nfunctions. However, by the work of Thomas' work alluded to above, we have\nbeen able to show that this is the case for the types of singularities occurring\nin [GG07]. This answers a question of Green and Griffiths (see note at bottom\nof [GG07][p. 225]).\nNotation. A complex variety will mean an integral separated scheme X of\nfinite type over C. Following Saito, we write dX for dim X to shorten some of the\nexpressions. If E is a locally free sheaf on X and s \u2208 \u0393(X, E ), we write V (s) for\nthe zero locus of s [Har77].\nBy a perverse sheaf we mean a perverse sheaf for the middle perversity. If\nf : X \u2192 Y is a morphism between complex varieties, we write f\u2217 , f! , f \u2217 , f ! for\nthe derived functors between the bounded derived categories of constructable\nsheaves following the convention of [BBD82, 1.4.2.3]. However, we deviate\nsligtly from this convention is \u00a77 where we write f\u2217 F (instead of 0H f\u2217 F ) for\nthe usual push-forward of a constructible sheaf F .\nWe write MHS for Deligne's category of mixed Hodge structures. When necessary for clarity, we write MHSR for the category of mixed Hodge structures\nwith coefficients in a ring R. Similarly, we write VMHS(S) or VMHSR (S) for\nthe category of variations of mixed Hodge structures with R coefficients over a\nseparated analytic space S.\nRemark 1.4. The reader might guess that analogues of the results in this paper\ncan be obtained in characteristic p by replacing mixed Hodge modules by mixed\nperverse sheaves. Indeed this is the case. To the best of our knowledge, in\nproving our key intermediate results we have used no fact about mixed Hodge\nmodules that is not the direct analogue of a corresponding fact about mixed\nperverse sheaves.\nAcknowledgments.

A DMISSIBLE\n\nNORMAL FUNCTIONS AND I NTERSECTION\n\nC OHOMOLOGY\n\nLet j : S \u2192 S be an open immersion of smooth complex manifolds. If E is a\nlocal system of Q-vector spaces on S and s \u2208 S is a closed point, we set\nHis (E) := colim Hi (S \u2229U, E)\ns\u2208U\n\nwhere the colimit is taken over all open neighborhoods U of s. If i : {s} \u2192\nS denotes the inclusion morphism, then His (E) = Hi ({s}, i\u2217 R j\u2217 E). (We ask the\nreader to distinguish between the integer i and the morphism i based on the\ncontext.)\n\n\f4\n\nPATRICK BROSNAN, HAO FANG, ZHAOHU NIE, AND GREGORY PEARLSTEIN\n\n2.1. Now assume that S and S are both equidimensional of dimension d and\nthat j is an open immersion. The local system E defines a perverse sheaf E[d]\non S (since S is smooth). Moreover, by intermediate extension, it defines a\nperverse sheaf j!\u2217 Q[d] on S. Adopting the standard notation, we set\nIHi (S, E) = Hi\u2212d (S, j!\u2217 E[d])\nIHis (E) = Hi\u2212d ({s}, i\u2217 j!\u2217 E[d]).\nNote that, j!\u2217 E[d] maps to j\u2217 E[d]: it is defined as a subobject of p j\u2217 E[d] :=\nH 0 ( j\u2217 E[d]) in the category of perverse sheaves and p j\u2217 is left t-exact. Therefore\nwe have natural maps\np\n\nIHi (S, E) \u2192 Hi (S, E);\n\nIHis (E) \u2192 His (E).\n\nLemma 2.2. With E, S and S as in (2.1), we have\nIH0 (S, E) = H0 (S, E),\nIH0s (E) = H0s (E),\nIH1 (S, E) \u0592\u2192 H1 (S, E),\nIH1s (E) \u0592\u2192 H1 (S, E).\nProof. Since p j\u2217 is left t-exact, we have a distinguished triangle\n(2.3)\n\np\n\nj\u2217 E[d] \u2192 j\u2217 E[d] \u2192 p \u03c4\u22651 j\u2217 E[d] \u2192 p j\u2217 E[d + 1].\n\nBy [BBD82, (2.1.2.1)], H i ( p \u03c4\u22651 j\u2217 E[d]) = 0 for i \u2264 \u2212d. Therefore, the map p j\u2217 E[d] \u2192\nj\u2217 E[d] induces isomorphisms\nHi (S, p j\u2217 E[d]) \u2192 Hi (S, E[d]),\nHis ( p j\u2217 E[d]) \u2192 His ( j\u2217 E[d])\nfor i \u2264 \u2212d. Moreover, we have injections H\u2212d+1 (S, p j\u2217 E[d]) \u2192 H\u2212d+1 (S, E[d]) and\nH\u2212d+1\n( p j\u2217 E[d]) \u2192 H\u2212d+1\n( j\u2217 E[d]).\ns\ns\nSimilarly, there is an exact sequence\n(2.4)\n\n0 \u2192 j!\u2217 E[d] \u2192 p j\u2217 E[d] \u2192 F \u2192 0\n\nin Perv(S) where F is a perverse sheaf supported on S \\ S. It follows that H i (F) =\n0 for i \u2264 \u2212d. The result now follows immediately from the long exact sequence\nin cohomology (resp. local cohomology at s) induced by (2.4).\n\u0003\n2.5. Now suppose that j : S \u2192 S of (2.1) is an open immersion of S as a Zariski\nopen subset of S [Sai96, Definition 1.4]. Furthermore, suppose that H is a variation of Hodge structure of weight \u22121 on S. We write NF(S, H ) for the group\nof normal functions from S into J(H ). By [Sai96], there is a canonical isomorphism NF(S, H ) = Ext1VMHS(S) (Z, H ). Moreover, if we let VMHS (S)ad\nS denote the\nsubcategory of variations of mixed Hodge structure on S which are admissible\nwith respect to the open immersion j : S \u2192 S, then the group Ext1\nad (Z, H )\nVMHS (S)S\n\nis a subgroup of NF(S, H ). Following [Sai96, Definition 1.4], we call these the\nadmissible normal functions with respect to S and write NF(S, H )Sad for this\ngroup.\n\n\fNORMAL FUNCTIONS\n\n5\n\nFact 2.6. Let \u03bd \u2208 NF(S, H ) be a normal function on S. Let Shv(S) denote the\ncategory of all sheaves on S and write r : VMHS(S) \u2192 Shv(S) for the forgetful\nfunctor taking a variation of mixed Hodge structure H on S to its underlying\nsheaf of abelian groups HZ . Then clZ (\u03bd ) is the image of \u03bd under the composition\nr\n\nNF(S, H ) = Ext1VMHS(S) (Z, H ) \u2192 Ext1Shv(S) (Z, HZ ) = H1 (S, HZ ).\nWe leave the (straightforward) verification of the above statement to the\nreader.\n2.7. If \u03bd \u2208 H 0 (S, J (H )) is a continuous section of the complex torus J(H ), we\nwrite cl(\u03bd ) for the image of clZ (\u03bd ) in H1 (S, HQ ). If s \u2208 S with S as in (2.5), we\nwrite \u03c3s (\u03bd ) for the image of \u03c3Z,s (\u03bd ) in Hs1 (HQ ).\nThe following is a type of \"universal coefficient theorem\" for variations of\nmixed Hodge structure and normal functions.\nLemma 2.8. Let S be as in 2.5.\n(i) Let V and W be variations of mixed Hodge structure on S. If \u03c00 (S) is\nfinite, then the natural map\nHomVMHSZ (S) (V , W ) \u2297 Q \u2192 HomVMHSQ (S) (VQ , WQ )\nis an isomorphism.\n(ii) If \u03c00 (S) is finite and \u03c01 (S, s) is finitely generated for each s \u2208 S, then the\nnatural map\nExt1VMHSZ (S) (Z, W ) \u2297 Q \u2192 Ext1VMHSQ (S) (Q, WQ )\nis an isomorphism.\n(iii) If the conditions of (ii) are satisfied, then, for any variation of pure\nHodge structure H of weight \u22121 on S, the natural map\nNF(S, H ) \u2297 Q = Ext1VMHSZ (S) (Z, H ) \u2297 Q \u2192 Ext1VMHSQ (S) (Q, HQ )\nis an isomorphism.\nProof. (i) is obvious, and (iii) follows directly from (ii). We leave to the reader\nthe fact that the map in (ii) is injective. To see that it is surjective, suppose\np\n\n0 \u2192 WQ \u2192 V \u2192 Q \u2192 0\nis an exact sequence of rational variations of mixed Hodge structure on S. Assume first that S is connected. Then, using the fact that \u03c01 (S, s) is finitely\ngenerated, we can find a lattice VZ \u2282 V such that VZ \u2229 WQ = W . We then have\np(VZ ) = \u03b1 Z for some \u03b1 \u2208 Q\u2217 . Scaling by \u03b1 we obtain the desired result.\nWe leave the case where S has finitely many connected components (where\nwe may have to scale by more than one \u03b1 and add up the results) to the reader.\n\u0003\nCorollary 2.9. Under the assumptions of Lemma 2.8 and the notation of (2.5),\nwe have\n\u2297 Q = Ext1VMHS(S)ad (Q, HQ ).\nNF(S, H )ad\nS\nS\n\nProof. This follows directly from the Lemma 2.8 because admissibility of variations of a mixed Hodge structure V depends only on VQ .\n\u0003\n\n\f6\n\nPATRICK BROSNAN, HAO FANG, ZHAOHU NIE, AND GREGORY PEARLSTEIN\n\nDefinition 2.10. We call an element \u03bd \u2208 Ext1VMHS(S)ad (Q, HQ ) an admissible QS\n\nnormal function.\nThe main result of this section is the following.\n\nTheorem 2.11. Let j : S \u2192 S be an open immersion of smooth manifolds as\nin (2.5) and let H be a variation of pure Hodge structure of weight \u22121 on S. The\n\u2192 H1 (S, HQ ) factors through IH1 (S, HQ ).\ngroup homomorphism clQ : NF(S, H )ad\nS\nSimilarly, for each s \u2208 S, the map \u03c3s : NF(S, H )Sad \u2192 H1s (HQ ) factors through\nIH1s (HQ ).\nWe will use a few lemmas concerning the intermediate extensions of perverse sheaves and mixed Hodge modules on S. The first concerns the fact that\nj!\u2217 is \"End-exact\" when applied to perverse sheaves on S; that is, it preserves\ninjections and surjections. In N. Katz's book [Kat96, p. 87], this fact is stated\nand a proof is sketched. For completeness and the convenience of the reader,\nwe give a proof here.\nLemma 2.12. Let j : S \u2192 S be an open immersion as in 2.11. Suppose that the\nsequence\nf\n\ng\n\n0 \u2192 A \u2192B \u2192C \u21920\nis exact in Perv(S). Then j!\u2217 ( f ) is an injection and j!\u2217 (g) is a surjection in Perv(S).\nProof. By [BBD82, Prop 1.4.16], p j! is right-exact and p j\u2217 is left-exact. From\nthe definition of the intermediate extension functor ([BBD82, 2.1.7], we have\nthe following commutative diagram with exact top and bottom rows.\npj A\n// p j! B\n// p j!C\n// 0\n!\n\n0\n\n\u000f\u000f\u000f\u000f\nj!\u2217 A\n\u000f\u000f\n\n\u000f\u000f\u000f\u000f\n// j!\u2217 B\n\u000f\u000f\n\n\u000f\u000f\u000f\u000f\n// j!\u2217C\n\u000f\u000f\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// p j\u2217 A\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// p j\u2217 B\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// p j\u2217C\n\nThe proposition now follows from chasing the diagram.\n\n\u0003\n\n2.13. For \" \" a separated reduced analytic space, we write MHM( ) for the category of mixed Hodge modules on \" \" and MHM( ) p for the category of polarizable mixed Hodge modules [Sai90, 2.17.8]. (It is understood that a left upper p\nstands for \"perversity\", while a right upper p stands for \"polarization\" in this\npaper.) If j : S \u2192 S is an open immersion as in (2.5), then we write MHM(S)Sp for\nthe category of polarizable mixed Hodge modules on S which are extendable to\nS. Recall that a mixed Hodge module M in MHM(S) is said to be smooth if rat M is\nisomorphic to E[dS ] where E is a local system on S where rat : MHM(S) \u2192 Perv(S)\ndenotes the functor of [Sai90, Theorem 0.1]. By [Sai90, Theorem 3.27] we have\nan equivalence of categories\nps\nVMHS(S)ad \u223c\n= MHM(S)\nS\n\nS\n\nwhere the right hand denotes the full subcategory of MHM(S)Sp consisting of\nsmooth mixed Hodge modules.\n\n\fNORMAL FUNCTIONS\n\n7\n\nDefinition 2.14. If a, c \u2208 Z, then we say that an object M in MHM( ) has\nweights in the interval [a, c] if GrW\ni M = 0 for i 6\u2208 [a, c].\nWe write j!\u2217 : MHM(S)S \u2192 MHM(S) for the functor given by\nj!\u2217 M = im(H 0 j! M \u2192 H 0 j\u2217 M).\nBy [Sai90, 2.18.1], both j! and j\u2217 preserve polarizability. Therefore, for M in\nMHM(S)Sp , j!\u2217 M is in MHM(S) p .\np\n\nLemma 2.15. If M is an object in MHM(S)S with weights in the interval [a, c],\nthen j!\u2217 M also has weights in [a, c].\nProof. By [Sai90, Proposition 2.26], H 0 j! M has weights \u2264 c and H 0 j\u2217 M has\nweights \u2265 a. Since maps between polarizable mixed Hodge modules are strict\np\np\nwith respect to the weight filtration, the functor GrW\ni : MHM(S) \u2192 MHM(S) is\n0\nexact [Del71, Proposition 1.1.11] for each i \u2208 Z. It follows that j!\u2217 M = im(H j! M \u2192\nH 0 j\u2217 M) has weights in [a, c].\n\u0003\n2.16. The functor j!\u2217 is not in general exact. However, for C, A pure of respective\nweights c and a in MHM(S) p ,\nExt j (C, A) = 0 if c < a + j.\nThis is stated explicitly in the algebraic case in [Sai90, Eq. 4.5.3]; however, the\nproof given there clearly applies to the polarizable analytic case.\nFrom this and the fact that j!\u2217 commutes with finite direct sums, we see that\nj!\u2217 preserves the exactness of the sequence\n(2.17)\n\nf\n\ng\n\n0 \u2192 A \u2192B \u2192C \u21920\n\nprovided A is pure of weight a and C is pure of weight c with c < a + 1.\nLemma 2.18. Suppose that the entries in (2.17) consist of objects in MHM(S)Sp\nwhere A is pure of weight a and C is pure of weight c with c \u2264 a + 1. Then the\nsequence\n(2.19)\n\nj!\u2217 ( f )\n\nj!\u2217 (g)\n\n0 \u2192 j!\u2217 A \u2192 j!\u2217 B \u2192 j!\u2217C \u2192 0\n\nis exact in MHM(S) p .\nProof. Write i : Z \u2192 S for the complement of S in S. The lemma will follow\nmainly from [BBD82, Corollary 1.4.25] which gives the following description\nof the intermediate extension in our context.\n(*) j!\u2217 B is the unique prolongement of B in MHM(S) with no non-trivial\nsub-object or quotient object in the essential image of the functor i\u2217 :\nMHM(Z) \u2192 MHM(S).\nHere we have used the fact that rat : MHM( ) \u2192 Perv( ) is faithful and exact\nto deduce (*) from the corresponding statement in [BBD82].\nBy (2.16), we already know that the theorem holds for c \u2264 a; thus, it suffices\nto consider the case c = a + 1.\nBy Lemma 2.15, we know that j!\u2217 B has weights in the interval [a, c]. By\nLemma 2.12 and the exactness of GrW , we know that GrW\nc j!\u2217 B = j!\u2217C \u2295 D for\nsome object D in MHM(S) p which is pure of weight c. By the definition of j!\u2217 B,\n\n\f8\n\nPATRICK BROSNAN, HAO FANG, ZHAOHU NIE, AND GREGORY PEARLSTEIN\n\nwe know that D is supported on Z. But, since j!\u2217 B surjects onto D via the\ncomposition\nj!\u2217 B \u0589 GrW\nc j!\u2217 B \u0589 D\nthis contradicts (*) unless D = 0.\nW\nThus GrW\nc j!\u2217 B = j!\u2217C. By similar reasoning, we see that Gra j!\u2217 B = j!\u2217 A.\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 2.20. Let S be as in Theorem 2.11. Then the functor VMHSQ (S)Sad\nMHM(S)Sp sending a variation V to V [d] induces isomorphisms\nExtiVMHS\n\n\u223c\n=\n\nad\nQ (S)S\n\n(V , W ) \u2192 ExtiMHM(S) p (V [d], W [d])\nS\n\nfor i = 0, 1.\nProof. For i = 0 this follows from [Sai90, Theorem 3.27]. For i = 1, this follows\nfrom the (easy) fact that an extension of smooth perverse sheaves is smooth.\n\u0003\nCorollary 2.21. Suppose j : S \u2192 S and H are as in Theorem 2.11. Then the\nrestriction map\nj\u2217\n\nExt1MHM(S) p (Q[d], j!\u2217 HQ [d]) \u2192 Ext1MHM(S) p (Q[d], HQ [d]) = NF(S, H )ad\n\u2297Q\nS\nS\n\nis an isomorphism.\nProof. Lemma 2.18 shows that j\u2217 is surjective. On the other hand, suppose\n\u03bd \u2208 Ext1MHM(S) p (Q[d], j!\u2217 H [d]) given by the sequence\n0 \u2192 j!\u2217 H [d] \u2192 B \u2192 Q[d] \u2192 0\nj\u2217 .\n\nis in the kernel of\nThen there is a splitting s : Q[d] \u2192 j\u2217 B. Applying j!\u2217 to\ns, we obtain a splitting Q[d] \u2192 j!\u2217 j\u2217 B. But it is easy to see from Lemma 2.18\nthat B = j!\u2217 j\u2217 B (as both are extensions of Q[d] by j!\u2217 H [d]). Therefore \u03bd = 0. It\nfollows that j\u2217 is injective.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 2.11.

The assertions in Theorem 2.11 are, thus, a direct consequence of\nthe fact that the arrow on top is an isomorphism (2.21).\n\u0003\n2.23. Suppose H is a Q-mixed Hodge structure. We call a class v \u2208 HQ Tate of\nweight w if it can be expressed as the image of 1 under a morphism Q(\u2212w/2) \u2192\nH of Hodge structures (for some even integer w).\nTheorem 2.24. Let H be a variation of pure Hodge structure as in Theorem 2.11. Then, for s \u2208 S, the class \u03c3s (\u03bd ) \u2208 IH1s (HQ ) is Tate of weight 0.\n\n\fNORMAL FUNCTIONS\n\n9\n\nTo prove Theorem 2.24, we are are going to use a general fact about mixed\nHodge modules on reduced separated schemes of finite type over C; that is, we\nuse a result from the theory of mixed Hodge modules in the algebraic case. If X\nis such a scheme, we write MHM(X) for the category of mixed Hodge modules\non X. If X is any proper scheme in which X is embedded as an open subscheme,\nthen the category MHM(X) is equivalent to the category MHM(X an )Xp an . Here, as\nin [Sai90, p. 313] where this statement is proved, X an denotes the underlying\nanalytic space associated to X.\nFact 2.25. Let X be a reduced separated scheme of finite type over C, and let M\nand N be objects in Db MHM(X). Then there is a natural Hodge structure on the\ngroup HomDb Perv(X) (rat M, rat N) and the image of the natural map\nrat\n\nHomDb MHM(X) (M, N) \u2192 HomDb Perv(X) (rat M, rat N)\nconsists of Tate classes of weight 0.\nSketch. Let \u03c0 : X \u2192 Spec C denote the structure morphism. Then\n(2.26)\n\nHomDb Perv(X) (rat M, rat N) = rat H 0 \u03c0\u2217 Hom(M, N)\n\nwhere Hom(M, N) denotes the internal Hom in Db MHM(X). Since MHM(Spec C)\nis equivalent to the category of mixed Hodge structures with rat taking a Hodge\nstructure to its underlying Q-vector space, the above isomorphism puts a mixed\nHodge structure on HomDb Perv(X) (rat M, rat N). We leave the rest of the verification to the reader.\n\u0003\n, let \u03bd \u2208 Ext1MHM(S) p (Q[d], j!\u2217 HQ [d])\nProof of Theorem 2.24.

For an object M in Db MHM(Y),\nset\nHnA (Y, M) = HomDb MHM(Y) (Q, M[n]).\nThe functor rat : MHM(Y ) \u2192 Perv(Y ) induces a \"cycle class map\"\nrat : HnA (Y, M) \u2192 Hn (Y, M)\nto the hypercohomology of rat M.

This is consequence of (2.22), Corollary 2.21 and the notation of (3.1)\nwhich converts the top line of (2.22) into absolute Hodge cohomology groups.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.4. Since the map IH1s (H ) \u2192 H1s (H ) is an injection by Lemma 2.2 and\nthe map \u03c3 p : NF(S, H )ad \u2192 H1s (H ) factors through IH1s (H ), we can write \u03c3s (\u03bd )\nfor the class of an admissible normal function \u03bd in IH1s (H ).\n4.

Moreover, the object \u03c0\u2217 Q[dX ] in Db MHM(P)\nis pure of weight dX ; equivalently, the mixed Hodge modules H i (\u03c0\u2217 Q[dX ]) occurring in the decomposition are pure of weight dX + i [Sai88, Theorem 1].\nRemark 4.2. The decomposition of 4.1 is not unique. However, we can (and do)\nrequire that it induces the identity map on the H i (\u03c0\u2217 Q[dX ]). In fact, there is\na preferred choice of decomposition [Del68, Remark 1.8]. To fix ideas we will\nchoose the preferred one.\n4.3. The summands appearing in (4.1) can be further decomposed by codimension of strict support [Sai89, 3.2.6]: we can write\n(4.4)\n\nH i (\u03c0\u2217 Q[dX ]) = \u2295Ei,Z (\u03c0 )\n\n\fNORMAL FUNCTIONS\n\n11\n\nwhere Z is a closed subscheme of P and Ei,Z (\u03c0 ) is a Hodge module supported on\nZ with no sub or quotient object supported in a proper subscheme of Z.\nLet us set Ei j (\u03c0 ) = \u2295codimP Z= j Ei,Z (\u03c0 ). We then have a decomposition\n(4.5)\n\n\u03c0\u2217 Q[dX ] = \u2295Ei j (\u03c0 )[\u2212i].\n\nWe write Ei,Z (resp. Ei j ) for Ei,Z (\u03c0 ) (resp.

We write \u03a0i j : \u03c0\u2217 Q[dX ] \u2192 Ei j [\u2212i] for the projection map and Si j :\nEi j [\u2212i] \u2192 \u03c0\u2217 Q[dX ] for the inclusion.

Since\nEi0 is pure, it follows that Ei0 contains F as a direct factor. Since any complement of F in Ei0 would have to be supported on a proper subscheme of P, the\nproposition follows from the definition of Ei0 .\n\u0003\nCorollary 4.9.

Clearly we can take\nUi0 = Psm and\nHi0 = Hi+dX \u2212dP .\nHodge classes and normal functions. The variation H2k\u22121 (k) on Psm is an\nadmissible VMHS of weight \u22121 with respect to P for each integer k. Then by\nCorollary 2.21\nIH1A (P, H2k\u22121 (k)) = NF(Psm , H2k\u22121 (k))ad\nP .\nBy Corollary 4.9, the above is a direct factor in H2k\nA (X , Q(k)).

For \u03b1 \u2208 H2k\nA (X , Q(k))prim , Nk (\u03b1 )(p) = \u03b1|X p .\nSketch. This is not hard to see using (2.5) and Remark 4.2, i.e., the fact that (4.1)\ninduces the identity on cohomology.\n\u0003\n2k\nProposition 4.12. Let Zk := ker(rat : H2k\nA (X , Q(k)) \u2192 H (X , Q(k)). Then, for\neach p \u2208 P and each \u03b1 \u2208 Zk , \u03c3 p (Nk (\u03b1 )) = 0.\n\nProof. This follows from the commutativity of the diagram\nH2k\nA (X , Q(k))\n\n\u03a0\n\nrat\n\n\u000f\u000f\n\nH2k (X , Q(k))\n\n// IH1 (P, H2k\u22121 (k))\nA\n\n=\n\n// NF(Psm , H2k\u22121 (k))ad\nP\n\u03c3p\n\nrat\n\u03a0\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// IH1 (P, H2k\u22121 (k))\n\n\u000f\u000f\n\n// IH1p (H2k\u22121 (k)).\n\u0003\n\n\fNORMAL FUNCTIONS\n\n13\n\n4.13. Now suppose that X is projective. Then the image of rat : H2k\nA (X , Q(k)) \u2192\nH2k (X , Q(k)) is exactly the subgroup Hodgek (X ) := Hk,k (X ) \u2229 H2k (X , Q(k)) of\nHodge classes in X . By Proposition 4.12, if \u03b11 , \u03b12 are two classes in H2k\nA (X , Q(k))\n2k\nsuch that rat(\u03b11 ) = rat(\u03b12 ) \u2208 H (X , Q(k)), then \u03c3 p (\u03b11 ) = \u03c3 p (\u03b12 ) for each p \u2208 P. In\nother words, the group homomorphism \u03c3 p : H2k (X , Q(k)) \u2192 IH1p (H2k\u22121 (k)) factors through the quotient Hodgek (X ) of H2k\nA (X , Q(k)). We, thus, obtain a group\nhomomorphism\n\u03c3 p : Hodgek (X ) \u2192 IH1p (H2k\u22121 (k))\nfor every p \u2208 P. In fact, it is easy to see that this group homomorphism is simply\nthe restriction to Hodgek (X ) of the composition of the arrows in the lower half\nof the diagram used in the proof of Proposition 4.12.\n5. VANISHING\nWe begin this section by formalizing some notation.\n5.1. Let X be a smooth projective complex variety of dimension 2n with n an\ninteger and let L be a very ample line bundle on X. Set P := |L | and let\nX := {(x, f ) \u2208 X \u00d7 P| f (x) = 0}.\nWe call X the incidence variety associated to the pair (X, L ). Let pr : X \u2192 X\ndenote the first projection and \u03c0 : X \u2192 P denote the second projection. Let d :=\ndP . Then X is smooth of dimension r := 2n + d \u2212 1 because pr is a Zariski local\nfibration with fiber Pd\u22121 . The map \u03c0 : X \u2192 P is smooth over the complement\nof the dual variety X \u2228 \u2282 P.\nWe now state an analogue of the Weak Lefschetz theorem for the map \u03c0 .\nTheorem 5.2 (Perverse Weak Lefschetz). Let \u03c0 : X \u2192 P be as in (5.1), and let\nEi j = Ei j (\u03c0 ) be as in (4.5). Then\n(i) Ei j = 0 unless i = 0 or j = 0.\n(ii) Ei0 = Hi (X, Q[2n \u2212 1]) \u2297 Q[d] for i < 0.\nProof. Let pr2 : X \u00d7 P \u2192 P denote the projection on the second factor and let g :\nU \u2192 X \u00d7 P denote the complement of X in X \u00d7 P. We then have a commutative\ndiagram\ng\ni //\nX \u00d7 P oo\nU\nX F\nFF\nyy\ny\nFF\npr2 yy\nF\ny\n\u03c0 FF\nF## \u000f\u000f ||yyy p\nP\nwhere we write p : U \u2192 P for pr2|U .\nNote that g : U \u2192 X \u00d7 P is an affine open immersion. Therefore g! Q[2n + d] is\nperverse and we have an exact sequence\n0 \u2192 i\u2217 Q[2n + d \u2212 1] \u2192 g! Q[2n + d] \u2192 Q[2n + d] \u2192 0\n\n(5.3)\n\nin MHM(X \u00d7 P) [BBD82, Corollaire 4.1.3].\nApplying pr2 to (5.3) gives a distinguished triangle\n(5.4)\n\n\u03c0\u2217 Q[2n + d \u2212 1] \u2192 p!

Q[2n+d]) = 0 in MHM(P) for i < 0. It follows then that H i\u22121 (pr2\u2217 Q[2n+\n\n\f14\n\nPATRICK BROSNAN, HAO FANG, ZHAOHU NIE, AND GREGORY PEARLSTEIN\n\nd]) = H i (\u03c0\u2217 Q[2n + d \u2212 1]) for i < 0. Since H i\u22121 (pr2\u2217 Q[2n + d]) = H i (X, Q[2n \u2212 1]) \u2297\nQ[d] = Ei0 by weak Lefschetz, parts (i) and (ii) follow for i < 0.\nTo finish the proof of (i), note that, by the Hard Lefschetz Theorem [Sai88,\nTheorem 1 (b)],\nEi j \u223c\n= E\u2212i, j (\u2212i).\n\n(5.5)\n\nTherefore Ei j = 0 for i > 0 unless j = 0.\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 5.6. Let p \u2208 P(C). Then H pk (Ei j ) = 0 for k < j \u2212 d.\nProof. We have Ei j = (gi j )!\u2217 Hi j [d \u2212 j] with the notation as in (4.10). The result\nfollows from [BBD82, Proposition 2.1.11].\n\u0003\nCorollary 5.7. Let p \u2208 P(C), then\n\u2212d+1\n(E00 ) \u2295 H\u2212d+1\n(E01 ).\nH2n (X p , Q) = H\u2212d\np\np (E10 ) \u2295 H p\n\nProof. By (4.6),\nH2n (X p , Q) = H1\u2212d (X p , Q[dX ])\n= \u2295i j H1\u2212d\u2212i\n(Ei j ).\np\nBy Theorem 5.2 and (5.5), we see that, for i 6= 0,\n(\nHi (X, Q[2n \u2212 1]) k = \u2212d\nHkp (Ei0 ) =\n0\nelse.\n(Ei j ) contributing to H2n (X p , Q) with i 6= 0\nTherefore, the only summand H1\u2212d\u2212i\np\n\u2212d\nis H p (E10 ). Thus\n(5.8)\n\nM\n\nH2n (X p , Q) = H\u2212d\np (E10 ) \u2295 (\n\nH1\u2212d\np (E0 j ).\n\nj\n\nHowever, by Lemma 5.6, H1\u2212d\np (E0 j ) = 0 for j > 1.\n\n\u0003\n\nIn fact, the term E01 is not difficult to compute and often trivial. It is governed by Lefschetz pencils.\nDefinition 5.9. Let P(L ) be a property of ample line bundles. We say that P\nholds for L \u226b 0 if for every ample line bundle L there is an integer N such\nthat P(L n ) holds for n > N.\n5.10. By [SGA7, Theorem 2.5], the projective embedding of X via the complete\nlinear system |L | is a Lefschetz embedding. Therefore, we can find a Lefschetz\npencil \u039b \u2282 P. To each p \u2208 \u039b \u2229 X \u2228 one has vanishing cycles \u03b4 p \u2208 H2n\u22121 (X\u03b7 , Q)\nwhere \u03b7 denotes a point of \u039b(C) such that X\u03b7 is smooth. We say that the\nvanishing cycles are non-trivial if \u03b4 p 6= 0 for some p \u2208 \u039b \u2229 X \u2228 . Note that this\nproperty depends only on L : it is independent of the choice of \u039b \u2282 P. By the\nwell-known fact that the vanishing cycles are conjugates of each other by the\nglobal monodromy of the Lefschetz fibration, it is equivalent to saying that\n\u039b \u2229 X \u2228 6= 0/ and \u03b4 p 6= 0 for all p \u2208 \u039b \u2229 X \u2228 .\nProposition 5.11. For L \u226b 0, the vanishing cycles are non-trivial.\n\n\fNORMAL FUNCTIONS\n\n15\n\nProof. If the vanishing cycles are trivial, then the global monodromy of the\nLefschetz pencil is trivial. It follows from the invariant cycle theorem that\nH2n\u22121 (X) surjects onto H2n\u22121 (X\u03b7 ) with \u03b7 as in (5.10). However, it is easy to see\nthat, by taking n \u226b 0, and considering Lefschetz pencils for the complete linear\nsystem |L n |, we can make dim H2n\u22121 (X\u03b7 ) tend to infinity.\n\u0003\nTheorem 5.12. If the vanishing cycles are non-trivial, we have E01 = 0; otherwise, H01 is a rank 1 variation of pure Hodge structure supported on a dense\nopen subset of X \u2228 .\nProof. Suppose H01 6= 0. Then clearly it is supported on a Zariski open subset U01 of X \u2228 and, since X \u2228 is irreducible this subset must be dense. Suppose p \u2208 U01 (C). Then H\u2212d+1\n(E01 ) = (H01 ) p . It follows from Corollary 5.7 that\np\nH2n (X p , Q) 6= H\u2212d (E10 ) = H2n\u22122 (X, Q)(\u22121). There is a dense open subset V \u2282\nU01 (C) such that, if p \u2208 V (C), then there is a Lefschetz pencil \u039b through p. By\nthe vanishing cycles exact sequence (see [SGA7, Theorem 3.4 (ii)]), this implies\nthat all the \u03b4 p are zero.\nNow suppose that the \u03b4 p are zero. Using the vanishing cycles exact sequence\nagain, we see that dim H2n (X p ) = dim H2n (X\u03b7 ) + 1. Now, note that, since p is a\nsmooth point of the discriminant locus X \u2228 ,\n(5.13)\n\n1\nH1\u2212d\np (E00 ) = IH p (H2n\u22121 ) = 0.\n\n(This follows from the fact that the local intersection cohomology of a local\nsystem ramified along a smooth divisor at a point p in that divisor is trivial.)\nSince H\u2212d (E10 ) \u223c\n= H2n (X\u03b7 ), (5.13) implies that dim H1\u2212d\np (E01 ) = 1. It follows that\ndim (H01 ) p = 1.\n\u0003\nRemark 5.14. In fact, N. Fakhruddin has shown us that, if L \u226b 0, we have Ei j =\n0 for all i and for all j > 0. The proof, whose details will appear elsewhere, relies\non the fact that, for L \u226b 0, the locus of hypersurfaces in |L | with non-isolated\nsingularities has codimension larger than the dimension of the hypersurfaces.\nCorollary 5.15. Let \u03b6 \u2208 H2n (X, Z(n)) be a primitive Hodge class, let \u03c9 \u2208 H2n\nD (X, Q(n))\nbe a Deligne cohomology class such that p(\u03c9 ) = \u03b6 where p : H2n\n(X,\nQ(n))\n\u2192\nD\n2n\nHD (X, Q(n)) is the natural map (from the introduction). Suppose that the L\nis a very ample line bundle on X such that the vanishing cycles of P = |L | are\nnon-trivial. Let \u03bd be the normal function on P \\ X \u2228 given by p 7\u2192 \u03c9|X p . Then, for\np \u2208 P, we have\n\n\u03c3 p (\u03bd ) = \u03b6|X p\nin H2n (X p , Qn ).\nProof. Since the vanishing cycles in L are non-trivial, proper base change\nshows that\nH2n (X p , Q(n)) = IH0p (H2n (n)) \u2295 IH1p (H2n\u22121 (n)).\nAs in Proposition 4.12, write \u03a0 for the projection on the second factor.\n\n\f16\n\nPATRICK BROSNAN, HAO FANG, ZHAOHU NIE, AND GREGORY PEARLSTEIN\n\nSince \u03b6 is primitive, we have \u03a0(pr\u2217 \u03b6 ) = pr\u2217 \u03b6 . Therefore,\n\n\u03c3 p (\u03bd ) = \u03c3 p (pr\u2217 \u03b6 )\n= (\u03a0(pr\u2217 \u03b6 ))|X p\n= (pr\u2217 \u03b6 )|X p\n= \u03b6|X p .\n\u0003\nExample 5.16. Let X \u223c\n= P2 and set L = OP2 (2). Then dimX = 6 and dimP = 5.\nWe have E\u22121,0 = Q[5], E0,0 = 0 and E1,0 = Q(\u22121)[5]. Since the vanishing cycles are\ntrivial (H 1 (X\u03b7 ) = 0 and any Lefschetz pencil contains a singular conic), H01 is\nnon-zero. In fact, let V denote the locus of point p \u2208 P such that X p is the union\nof two distinct lines. Note that V is a dense open subset of X \u2228 and \u03c01 (V ) \u223c\n= Z/2.\nIt is easy to see that H01 is the unique non-trivial rank 1 variation of Hodge\nstructure of weight 2 on V . Moreover, it is not difficult to see that E0 j = 0 for\nj > 1.\n6. H ODGE C ONJECTURE\nIn this section, we complete the proof of Theorem 1.3.\nLet Y be a smooth projective complex variety and let k \u2208 Z. We write Algk Y\nfor the subspace of Hodgek Y consisting of algebraic cycles. The Hodge conjecture for Y is the statement that Algk Y = Hodgek Y for all k. By Poincar\u00e9 duality\nand the Hodge-Riemann bilinear relations, the cup product\n\u222a : H2k (Y, Q(k)) \u2297 H2(dY \u2212k) (Y, Q(dY \u2212 k)) \u2192 H2dY (Y, Q(dY )) = Q\nrestricts to a give a perfect pairing\n(6.1)\n\nHodgek Y \u2297 HodgedY \u2212k Y \u2192 Q.\n\nTherefore, the Hodge conjecture for Y is equivalent to the assertion that the\nperpendicular subspace (Algk Y )\u22a5 \u2282 HodgedY \u2212k Y is zero.\nLemma 6.2. The following two statements are equivalent:\n(i) The Hodge conjecture holds for all smooth projective complex varieties\nY.\n(ii) For every smooth projective complex variety X of dimension 2n with\nn \u2208 Z, (Algn X)\u22a5 = 0.\nProof. We have already seen that the first statement implies the second. Suppose then that the second statement holds. Let Y be a smooth projective variety. Suppose \u03b1 \u2208 Hodgek Y is perpendicular to AlgdY \u2212k Y . To prove the Hodge\nconjecture, we need to show that \u03b1 = 0. If dY = 2k then we are already done.\nSuppose then that dY < 2k. In this case, set X = Y \u00d7 P2k\u2212dY and let \u03b2 = pr\u22171 \u03b1 .\nSuppose \u03b2 \u222a [Z] 6= 0 for some [Z] \u2208 Algk X. Then, by the projection formula, \u03b1 \u222a\npr1\u2217 [Z] 6= 0. Since this would contradict the assumption that \u03b1 \u2208 (AlgdY \u2212k (Y ))\u22a5 ,\nwe must have \u03b2 \u2208 (Algk X)\u22a5 . But then \u03b2 = 0. Since the map pr\u22171 : H2k (Y, Q(k)) \u2192\nH2k (X, Q(k)) is injective, it follows that \u03b1 = 0.\nFinally, suppose that dY > 2k. Since Y is projective, we can use Bertini to find\na smooth subvariety i : X \u0592\u2192 Y which is the intersection of dY \u2212 2k hyperplane\nsections. By weak Lefschetz, the restriction map i\u2217 : H2k (Y, Q(k)) \u2192 H2k (X, Q(k))\n\n\fNORMAL FUNCTIONS\n\n17\n\nis injective. Suppose \u03b1 6= 0. Then 0 6= i\u2217 \u03b1 \u2208 Hodgek X. Therefore, by our assumption, there exists a closed k-dimensional subvariety Z \u2282 X such that i\u2217 (\u03b1 ) \u222a [Z] 6=\n0. Again, by the projection formula, it follows that \u03b1 \u222a i\u2217 [Z] 6= 0. Since this contradicts our assumption that \u03b1 is perpendicular to the algebraic classes, we\nsee that \u03b1 = 0.\n\u0003\nThe following lemma is well-known.\nLemma 6.3. Let X be a smooth projective complex variety. Let L be an ample\nline bundle on X and let Z \u2282 X be a closed subvariety. Then there exists an\ninteger N such that, for all m \u2265 N, there exists a divisor D \u2208 |L m | such that\nZ \u2282 D.\nProof. This follows from the definition of ample.\n\n\u0003\n\nLet (X, L ) be a pair as in (5.1). For each positive integer m, let Xm denote\nthe incidence variety associated to the pair (X , L \u2297m ). Write prm : Xm \u2192 X and\n\u03c0m : X \u2192 Pm := |L m | for the respective projections as in (5.1).\nLemma 6.4. Suppose the Hodge conjecture holds for X, then for every nonzero Hodge class \u03b6 \u2208 Hodge2n (X), there exists a non-zero integer m and a point\np \u2208 Pm (C) such that \u03b6|X p 6= 0.\nProof. Let \u03b6 be a non-zero class in Hodge2n (X). By Poincar\u00e9 duality and the\nHodge-Riemann relations, there exists a class \u03b1 \u2208 Hodge2n (X) such that 0 6=\n\u03b1 \u222a \u03b6 \u2208 Hodge4n (X) \u223c\n= Q(2n).\nBy the Hodge conjecture for X, we can write \u03b1 = \u2211ni=1 ai [Zi ] for ai \u2208 Q and Zi\nclosed subvarieties of X. Since \u03b6 \u222a \u03b1 6= 0, \u03b6 \u222a [Zi ] 6= 0 for some index i. Equiva\u0003\nlently, 0 6= \u03b6|Zi \u2208 H2n (Zi , Q(n)). The lemma then follows from Lemma 6.3.\nAs in the introduction, a class \u03b6 \u2208 Hodge2n (X) is said to be primitive if \u03b6 \u222a\nc1 (L ) = 0. To each primitive Hodge class \u03b1 and every positive integer m, we\ncan associate a Hodge class pr\u2217m (\u03b6 ) \u2208 H2k (X , Q(k))prim .\nTheorem 6.5. Assume that Hodge conjecture holds and let (X, L ) be a pair as\nin (5.1). Then for every non-zero primitive Hodge class \u03b6 \u2208 H2n (X, Q(n)), there\nexists a positive integer m and a p \u2208 Pm such that \u03c3 p (pr\u2217m (\u03b6 )) 6= 0.\nProof. Let \u03b6 \u2208 H2n (X, Q(n)) be a non-zero primitive Hodge class. By Lemma 6.4,\nthere exists an integer N such that, for every m \u2265 N, there exists p \u2208 |L m | such\nthat \u03b6|X p 6= 0. By Proposition 5.11, we can assume that the vanishing cycles\nof Lefschetz pencils in |L m | are non-zero for m \u2265 N. Therefore, if m \u2265 N and\np \u2208 Pm , Corollary 5.15 shows that\n\n\u03c3 p (pr\u2217m \u03b6 ) = \u03b6|X p\n6= 0.\n\u0003\nTheorem 6.6. Suppose that for every pair (X, L ) as in (5.1) and every primitive Hodge class \u03b6 \u2208 H2n (X, Q(n)), there exists an m \u2208 Z and a p \u2208 Pm such that\n\u03c3 p (pr\u2217m \u03b6 ) 6= 0. Then the Hodge conjecture holds.\n\n\f18\n\nPATRICK BROSNAN, HAO FANG, ZHAOHU NIE, AND GREGORY PEARLSTEIN\n\nProof. By Lemma 6.2, we only need to show that no middle dimensional primitive Hodge class is perpendicular to the algebraic cycles. If \u03b6 is a primitive\nHodge class, then \u03c3 p (pr\u2217m \u03b6 ) 6= 0 \u21d2 \u03a01 (\u03b6|X p ) 6= 0 \u21d2 \u03b6|X p 6= 0.\nWe then resolve singularity of X p and apply Deligne's mixed Hodge theory\nto finish the proof by induction. This step is similar to the remark (attributed\nto B. Totaro) on the bottom of page 181 of Thomas' paper [Tho05].\nfp \u2192 X p be a desingularization. Then \u03c1 \u2217 (\u03b6|X ) \u2208 H 2n (X\nfp ) is clearly\nLet \u03c1 : X\np\na Hodge class. We now prove that it is non-zero.\nH 2n (X p ) has a mixed Hodge structure whose weights range from 0 to 2n.

By the strictness of morphisms between mixed Hodge structures, we have\n2n H 2n (X ). Therefore \u03c1 \u2217 (\u03b6\n2n f\n\u03b6|X p 6= 0 \u2208 GrW\np\n|X p ) 6= 0 \u2208 H (X p ).\nfp of codiBy induction on dimension, there is an algebraic cycle W on X\nmension n \u2212 1 (hence of dimension n) which pairs non trivially with \u03c1 \u2217 (\u03b6|X p ).\nTherefore its pushforward to X pairs non trivially with \u03b6 . Then the Hodge\nconjecture follows by Lemma 6.2.\n\u0003\nThis completes the proof of Theorem 1.3.\n7. S INGULARITIES\n\nAND RATIONAL MAPS\n\nSuppose S is a smooth complex algebraic variety and H is a Q-variation\nof pure Hodge structure of weight \u22121 on S. To simplify notation, we write\nNF(S, H )ad for the group Ext1VMHS(S)ad (Q, H ). If H is a variation of pure Hodge\nstructure with integer coefficients of weight \u22121 on S, then NF(S, H )ad \u2297 Q =\nNF(S, HQ )ad by Corollary 2.9.\nLemma 7.1. Let S be a smooth complex algebraic variety, let H be a variation\nof Q-Hodge structure of weight \u22121 on S and let U \u2282 S be a non-empty Zariski\nopen subset. Then the restriction map\nNF(S, H )ad \u2192 NF(U, H|U )ad\nis an isomorphism.\nProof. Using resolution of singularities, find an open immersion j : S \u2192 S with S\nproper. Let jU : U \u2192 S denote the inclusion. then jU!\u2217 H [dU ] = j!\u2217 H [dS ]. Therefore, by Corollary 2.9,\nNF(S, H )ad = NF(S, H )Sad\n= Ext1MHM(S) (Q[dS ], j!\u2217 H [dS ])\n= Ext1MHM(S) (Q[dS ], jU!\u2217 H [dS ])\n= NF(U, H|U )ad\nS\n= NF(U, H|U )ad .\n\u0003\n\n\fNORMAL FUNCTIONS\n\n19\n\nDefinition 7.2. Let S be a smooth complex algebraic variety. We define a\ncategory GS as follows: Objects of GS are weight \u22121 variations of Q-Hodge\nstructure defined on some non-empty Zariski open subset U of S. If H and K\nare objects in GS defined on open sets U and V respectively, then a morphism \u03c6 :\nH \u2192 K is a morphism of variations of Hodge structure from H|U\u2229V to K|U\u2229V .\nWe call GS the category of variations of Hodge structure over the generic point\nof S. Note that, if we let MHM(S)a,b denote the full subcategory of MHM(S)\nconsisting of pure objects of weight a with support of pure codimension b, then\nGS is equivalent to MHM(S)d\u22121,0 . This equivalence is brought about by the\nfunctor sending H supported on a Zariski open j : U \u0592\u2192 S to the mixed Hodge\nmodule j!\u2217 H .\n7.3. Let H and K be two objects in GS with H defined on a Zariski open\nsubset U \u2282 S and K defined on a Zariski open subset V \u2282 S. A morphism\n\u03c6 : H \u2192 K in GS induces a morphism\n\n\u03c6\u2217 : NF(U, H )ad \u2192 NF(V, K )ad\nvia the composition\n\u03c6\u2217\nNF(U, H )ad \u223c\n= NF(U \u2229V, H )ad \u2192 NF(U \u2229V, K )ad \u223c\n= NF(V, K )ad .\n\nIt follows that the group NF(H )ad\nQ of admissible Q-normal functions of an object\nin GS is an isomorphism invariant.\n7.4. Let f : S 99K P be a dominant rational map between smooth projective\nvarieties. Then f induces a functor f \u2217 : GP \u2192 GS defined as follows. Given\nH defined on a Zariski open subset U of P, let V denote the largest Zariski\nopen subset of U over which f is defined. The functor sends H to f \u2217 H|V . A\nsimilar construction defines f \u2217 of a morphism. Note that we have a natural\nmap\nf \u2217 : NF(H )ad \u2192 NF( f \u2217 H )ad .\ndefined by pulling back the extension classes. In particular, if f is a birational\n\u2217\nad\n\u223c\nmap, NF(H )ad\nQ = NF( f H )Q .\nConjecture 7.5. Let f : S 99K P be a birational map between smooth projective\nvarieties, let H be a weight \u22121 variation of Hodge structure over the generic\npoint of P and let \u03bd \u2208 NF(H )ad be an admissible normal function over the\ngeneric point of P. If \u03bd is singular on P, then f \u2217 \u03bd is singular on S.\nOur initial motivation for making this conjecture was the the comparison of\nour result 1.3 with the analogous assertions made in [GG07].\nTo explain this motivation, we briefly recall the assertions of [GG07]. Let\nX, P and X be as in (5.1) and let X \u2228 \u2282 P denote the dual variety (i.e. discriminant locus) of X. In [GG07], the authors apply resolution of singularities to\nproduce a projective variety S equipped with a birational morphism f : S \u2192 P\nsuch that f \u22121 X \u2228 is a divisor with normal crossings. Let us call such an S a\nresolution of the discriminant locus. The authors then make the following conjecture.\nConjecture 7.6. For every non-torsion primitive Hodge class \u03b6 , there is an\ninteger k and a resolution f : S \u2192 P = |L k | of the discriminant locus such that,\nfor any Deligne cohomology class \u03c9 mapping to \u03b6 , f \u2217 \u03bd (\u03c9 , L k ) is singular on S.\n\n\f20\n\nPATRICK BROSNAN, HAO FANG, ZHAOHU NIE, AND GREGORY PEARLSTEIN\n\nOne of the main assertions of [GG07] is that Conjeture 7.6 holds (for all even\ndimensional X) if and only if the Hodge conjecture holds (for all smooth projective algebraic varieties). In fact, we will now prove this assertion by proving\nConjecture 7.5 in a special case, but we find this approach unsatisfying. Knowing conjecture 7.5 would give a more satisfying and direct proof.\nWe begin by establishing an easy case of Conjecture 7.5.\nProposition 7.7. Let P be a smooth projective variety, H a variation of pure\nHodge structure of weight \u22121 on the generic point of P and f : S \u2192 P a dominant\nmorphism. Let \u03bd \u2208 NF(H )ad . If f \u2217 \u03bd is singular on S, then \u03bd is singular on P.\nRemark 7.8. In the following proof and the rest of this section, we will work\nwith constructible sheaves as opposed to perverse sheaves. To ease the notation, when F is a constructible sheaf and f is a morphism of complex schemes,\nwe will write f\u2217 F for the usual (not derived) operation on constructible sheaves\nand Ri f\u2217 F for the constructible higher direct image.\nProof. Suppose that H is smooth over a dense Zariski open subset j : U \u0592\u2192 P.\nThe Leray spectral sequence for R j\u2217 H gives an exact sequence\n(7.9)\n\nsj\n\n0 \u2192 H1 (P, R0 j\u2217 H ) \u2192 H1 (U, H ) \u2192 H0 (P, R1 j\u2217 H )\n\nand \u03bd is singular on P if and only if s j (cl \u03bd ) 6= 0. The proposition follows by\nfunctoriality of the Leray spectral sequence applied to the pullback diagram\n(7.10)\n\nf \u22121U\n\njS\n\n// S\nf\n\n\u000f\u000f\nU\n\nj\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// P\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 7.11. Conjecture 7.6 implies Conjecture 1.2.\nWe now begin the proof of the reverse implication.\nLemma 7.12. Let f : S \u2192 P be a morphism of smooth, complex algebraic varieties. Let U be a non-empty Zariski open subset of P such that V := f \u22121U is\nZariski dense in S, and let V be a Q-local system on U. Form the cartesian\ndiagram\ni\n// S\nV\ng\n\nf\n\n\u000f\u000f\n\u000f\u000f\nj\n// P\nU\nusing the letters on the arrows as the names for the obvious maps. Then the\nbase change map f \u2217 j\u2217 V \u2192 i\u2217 g\u2217 V is an injection of constructible sheaves.\nProof. Suppose that s \u2208 S(C) and that p = f (s) \u2208 P(C). We can find a small ball B\n\u03c0 (B\u2229U,z)\nabout p \u2208 P such that B \u2229U is connected, and, for z \u2208 B \u2229U, ( f \u2217 j\u2217 V )s = Vz 1\n.\n\u22121\nWe can then find a small ball D \u2282 f B containing s such that D\u2229V is connected,\n\u03c0 (D\u2229V,w)\n. Without loss of generality, we can\nand then for w \u2208 D \u2229V , (i\u2217 g\u2217 V )s = Vw 1\nassume that f (w) = z. Since the action of \u03c01 (D \u2229V, w) on Vw then factors through\n\u03c01 (B \u2229U, z), it follows that the base-change map f \u2217 j\u2217 V \u2192 i\u2217 g\u2217 V is injective. \u0003\n\n\fNORMAL FUNCTIONS\n\n21\n\nLemma 7.13. Let C be a smooth curve and c \u2208 C(C) and set C\u2032 = C \\ {c}. Let\n\u03c0 : X \u2192 C be a flat, projective morphism from a complex algebraic scheme X ,\nand let \u03c0 \u2032 denote the restriction of \u03c0 to X \u2032 := \u03c0 \u22121C\u2032 . Suppose that \u03c0 \u2032 is smooth\nof relative dimension 2k \u2212 1 for k an integer and that Xc has at worst ODP\nsingularities. Set H = R2k\u22121 \u03c0\u2217\u2032 Q(k) and let j : C\u2032 \u2192 C denote the open immersion\nincluding C\u2032 in C. Then\n\u223c\n=\n\nH2k\u22121 Xc \u2192 ( j\u2217 H )c\nvia the natural morphism coming from the Clemens-Schmid exact sequence.\nProof. This follows from the Picard-Lefschetz formula of [SGA7, Theorem 3.4,\nExpos\u00e9 XV]: one uses the fact that the relative dimension is odd and the vanishing cycles are orthogonal.\n\u0003\nWe now consider a situation where we can show that the base change morphism of Lemma 7.12 induces an isomorphism.\nLemma 7.14. Let h : X \u2192 P be a proper, flat morphism of relative dimension\n2 j \u2212 1 between smooth complex varieties such that h is smooth over a dense\nZariski open subset U \u2282 P and, for all p \u2208 P, X p presents at worst ODP singularities. Set H = R2k\u22121 h\u2217 Q(n)|U . Let f : S \u2192 P be a morphism from a smooth\nvariety such that V := f \u22121U is dense in S. Form the cartesian diagram\nV\n\ni\n\n// S\n\nj\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// P\n\ng\n\n\u000f\u000f\nU\n\nf\n\nusing the letters on the arrows as the names for the obvious maps. Then the\nbase change morphism induces an isomorphism f \u2217 j\u2217 H \u2192 i\u2217 g\u2217 H of sheaves.\nProof. We have already shown that the map is an injection. To prove surjectivity, we are going to use the local invariant cycle theorem of [BBD82].\nPick s \u2208 S(C). We can find a smooth curve C passing through s such that\nC\u2032 := C \u2229 V is dense in C. Since h : X \u2192 P is flat, hC : XC \u2192 C is also flat. It\nfollows that\n((i|C\u2032 )\u2217 H|C\u2032 )c \u223c\n= H2k\u22121 Xc .\nOn the other hand, since X is smooth, the local invariant cycle theorem shows\nthat\nH2k\u22121 Xc \u0589 ( j\u2217 H ) f (c) .\nTherefore we have a sequence\nH2k\u22121 Xc \u0589 ( j\u2217 H ) f (c) \u0592\u2192 (i\u2217 g\u2217 H )c \u0592\u2192 ((i|C\u2032 )\u2217 H|C\u2032 )c \u223c\n= H2k\u22121 Xc .\nSince the composition is the identity, the maps in the sequence are all isomorphisms.\n\u0003\nLemma 7.15. Let f : X \u2192 Y be a projective birational morphism between smooth\ncomplex varieties. Let F be a constructible sheaf of Q-vector spaces on P. Then\n(i) the map F \u2192 f\u2217 f \u2217 F is an isomorphism of constructible sheaves;\n(ii) we have R1 f\u2217 f \u2217 F = 0.\n\n\f22\n\nPATRICK BROSNAN, HAO FANG, ZHAOHU NIE, AND GREGORY PEARLSTEIN\n\nProof. It suffices to check both statements on the stalks. By using proper base\nchange, we see that the first statement follows from Zariski's main theorem.\nSimilarly, the second statement follows from the fact that the fibers of a projective birational morphism bet wen separated schemes of finite type over C are\nsimply connected.\n\u0003\nTheorem 7.16. Let h : X \u2192 P be as in Lemma 7.14 and let f : S \u2192 P be a\nprojective birational morphism. Let H and U be as in Lemma 7.14 and suppose\nthat \u03bd \u2208 NF(U, H )ad\nP . Then \u03bd has a non-torsion singularity on P if and only if\nf \u2217 \u03bd has a non-torsion singularity on S.\nProof. The \"if \" part follows from Proposition 7.7. To prove the \"only if \" direction, we can assume without loss of generality that f : f \u22121U \u2192 U is an isomorphism. In other words, we may replace the diagram (7.10) in the proof of\nProposition 7.7 with the following diagram\n(7.17)\n\n?? S\n~~\n~\n~\nf\n~~\n~~\n\u000f\u000f\n// P.\nU\nj\njS\n\nBy the functoriality of the sequence (7.9), we have a diagram\n(7.18)\n\n0\n\n// H1 (P, R0 j\u2217 H )\n\n// H1 (U, H )\n\n\u000f\u000f\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// H1 (U, H )\n\n// H0 (P, R1 j\u2217 H )\n\n\u223c\n=\n\n0\n\n// H1 (S, R0 jS\u2217 H )\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// H0 (S, R1 jS\u2217 H ).\n\nIt suffices then to show that the map H1 (P, R0 j\u2217 H ) \u2192 H1 (S, R0 jS\u2217 H ) is an isomorphism. For this, we apply the Leray spectral sequence coming from the\nmap f : S \u2192 P. We have an exact sequence\n(7.19)\n\n0 \u2192 H1 (P, j\u2217 H ) \u2192 H1 (S, jS\u2217 H ) \u2192 H0 (P, R1 f\u2217 ( jS\u2217 H )).\n\nBy Lemma 7.14, jS\u2217 H = f \u2217 j\u2217 H . Therefore, by Lemma 7.15, it follows that\nR1 f\u2217 ( jS\u2217 H ) = R1 f\u2217 f \u2217 j\u2217 H\n= 0.\nFrom the exactness of (7.19), it follows that the map H1 (P, j\u2217 H ) \u2192 H1 (S, jS\u2217 H )\nis an isomorphism.\n\u0003\nCorollary 7.20. Conjectures 7.6 and 1.2 are equivalent.\nProof. We have already shown that Conjecture 7.6 implies Conjecture 1.2. To\nprove the converse, we are going to use the result of Thomas alluded to in the\nintroduction.\nLet X \u2282 Pn be a projective complex variety of dimension 2n with n an integer\nand let \u03b6 denote a primitive Hodge class on X.\nSince Conjecture 1.2 holds, the Hodge conjecture also holds. Therefore, \u03b6 is\nalgebraic. By Thomas' result, it follows that, for k \u226b 0, we can find a hyperplane\nsection s \u2208 H0 (X, OX (k)) such that\n(i) \u03b6|V (s) is non-zero in H\u2217 (V (s), Q);\n(ii) V (s) has only ODP singularities.\n\n\fNORMAL FUNCTIONS\n\n23\n\nBy choosing k \u226b 0, we can assume that the vanishing cycles of Lefschetz\npencils in |OX (k)| are non-trivial. Then set L = OX (k) and let P, X and \u03c0 be the\nincidence scheme in (5.1).\nLet \u03c9 denote a lift of pr\u2217 \u03b6 to the Deligne cohomology of X and \u03bd = \u03bd (\u03c9 , L ).\nBy Corollary 5.15, we see that \u03bd has a non-torsion singularity at a the point\n[s] \u2208 P. Now suppose f : S \u2192 P is any proper birational morphism. By restricting\nthe locus in P of hyperplane sections intersecting X with only ODP singularities, we see from that f \u2217 \u03bd has a non-torsion singularity on S as well.\n\u0003\nR EFERENCES\n[BBD82] A.
