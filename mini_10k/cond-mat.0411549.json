Here the anisotropy is not only a necessary precondition of spontaneous ferromagnetism2 , but\nit determines many system properties as, e.g., the dependence of the magnetization vector or of the spin wave\nexcitation spectrum on an applied magnetic field. Additionally, the anisotropy energy is of the same order of\nmagnitude as the Interlayer Exchange Coupling (IEC)3 ,\nwhich is intimately connected with the GMR effect. Thus\nan investigation of these effects has to take the magnetic\nanisotropy carefully into account.\nThere is an important phenomenon in thin ferromagnetic films which is closely connected to the magnetic\nanisotropy: the magnetic reorientation transition. This\nterm denotes a rotation of the magnetization from the\nfilm normal into the plane or vice versa as a function of\ntemperature, film thickness, or external magnetic field.\nThe transition can be understood as a result of competing forces that favor different directions of the magnetization as e.g. spin orbit coupling, dipolar interaction,\nand an external magnetic field4 . It can be described using a Heisenberg model in film geometry, with the usual\nHeisenberg exchange interaction, an external field, and\none or more anisotropy terms.\nFor the simplest of these models,\nX\nX\nB 0 Si ,\n(1)\nJij Si Sj \u2212\nH1 = \u2212\ni\n\nij\n\nconsisting only of the exchange term and an external\nfield, there are very accurate approximation schemes\navailable. It was shown e.g. in Ref. 5 by comparison with\nQMC calculations, that the RPA decoupling7 yields even\nquantitative results for the magnetization as a function\nof temperature.\nTurning to anisotropy contributions, the spin-orbit coupling induced anisotropy is usually modelled by a single\nion anisotropy\nX\nSiz Siz ,\n(2)\nH2 = \u2212K2\ni\n\nwhich is of second order for systems with tetragonal symmetry. For film systems the z-axis is perpendicular to\nthe film plane. If K2 is positive the easy axis of the magnetization is the z-axis, for negative K2 this is a hard\ndirection. The RPA fails badly if applied to a local term\nas described in Eq. (2). Thus RPA can not be used to\nsolve the whole model\nH = H1 + H 2 .\n\n(3)\n\nIn Ref. 8 an approximation for this model is proposed,\nwhich is based on a combination of the RPA approximation for the nonlocal terms (1) and an Anderson-Callen\n(A.C.) decoupling10 for the local anisotropy contribution\n(2). This theory gives good results6 for the magnetization if the anisotropy constant K2 is much smaller\nthan the exchange coupling J (K2 \u2264 0.01J) and if the\nexternal field is applied parallel to the z-axis while K2\nhas to be positive. The first condition is not a serious\nrestriction, since in reality the anisotropy constants\nare indeed much smaller than the Heisenberg exchange\ninteraction. Furthermore this restriction can be relieved\nby an alternative theory11 . The important restriction\nis given by the second condition. The described limit\nis a very special one, where both, the anisotropy as\nwell as the external field favor a alignment of the\nmagnetization parallel to the z-axis. Thus there are\nno \"competing forces\", and no magnetic reorientation\ntransition occurs in this limit, which we want to refer\nto as \"parallel limit\" in the following. However, if the\nexternal field is not applied parallel to the z-axis and\nthe magnetization is consequently rotated out of z, the\napproximation described in Ref. 8 looses its accuracy\nand becomes unacceptable for a quantitative description\nof the reorientation transition. This was shown in Ref. 6\nby comparison with QMC calculations. Actually, to our\nknowledge there is no reliable model theory available,\nwhich can treat the model (3) for arbritrary directions\nof the external field or a negative anisotropy constant\nK2 .\nHowever, such a model theory is highly desirable. It\ncan be used to investigate quantitatively the magnetic\nreorientation transition in all systems dominated by\nsecond order lattice anisotropies. Numerical methods, as\nQMC calculations, are only applicable for the monolayer,\n\n\f2\nbut a finite number of layers is crucial to study the\ninterplay between surface and bulk anisotropies (see e.g.\nRef. 4).\nA priori, it is not clear, that such a model theory exists.\nThe full model (3) is much more complex then the\n\"parallel limit\" case. The reason is that in that special\ncase the total spin\nP isz a conserved quantity i.e. the total\nmagnetization\ni Si commutes with the Hamiltonian.\nThis property simplifies the calculations considerably\nbut it is not present in the general model (3).\nIn this paper we want to show that nevertheless a well\nfunded model theory can be formulated and that it is as\naccurate in the general case as in the \"parallel limit\".\nComparing our results with the QMC data of reference6\nwe will find excellent quantitative agreement for the\nmagnetization and its components, which allows for a\nhigh quality description of the magnetic reorientation\ntransition. The theory proposed in Ref. 8 is recovered\nfor the special case of the \"parallel limit\".\nIn this paper we want to introduce the new theory\nand evaluate it by comparison with available QMC\nresults. Since the latter are results for the monolayer,\nwe will exclusively treat the case of a monolayer during\nthis paper. A generalization to a multilayer system is\nstraightforward.\n\nII.\n\nTHEORY\n\nWe will assume tetragonal symmetry in the following.\nThe xy-plane is the film plane and thus the x\u2212 and the\ny\u2212 direction are equivalent. That is why we can confine\nthe external field and the magnetization to the zx-plane\nwithout loss of generality. We will assume nearest neighbor coupling (Jij = J for nearest neighbors and J = 0\nelsewhere) and for the explicit calculations a quadratic\nlattice. Let us first outline the main points of our theory.\nThe aim is to calculate the angle and the norm of the\ntotal magnetization of the model (3).\n1. In general, the magnetization is not aligned parallel to the z-axis. We therefore apply a coordinate\ntransformation that rotates our system to align its\nz-axis parallel to the magnetization. The calculations are much easier and also more convenient in\nthe new system referred to as \u03a3\u2032 .\n2. After this we write down the equation of motion\nof the single magnon Green function. To solve this\nequation it is necessary to\n3. decouple higher operator combinations. This appears to be straightforward for the exchange term\n(1) as long as one works in the rotated system \u03a3\u2032 .\nWe will perform the usual RPA decoupling7 here.\n4. The situation is more complex for the anisotropy\nterm (2). Here we will develop a new decoupling scheme following the ideas of the Callen\n\ndecoupling9 . However the original Callen decoupling is not applicable, since the total spin is not\na conserved quantity in our model. Therefore the\ndecoupling has to be generalized.\n5. There is a special rotation angle \u03b8\u0302 in our model:\nIf the coordinate system is rotated by this angle\n\u03a3 \u2192 \u03a3\u0302 and the decoupling\nP procedure is applied,\nthe total magnetization i Si\u1e91 commutes with the\nHamiltonian (3). It is easy to show that \u03b8\u0302 is therefore the direction\nof the magnetization. Now the\nP\ncondition [ i Si\u1e91 , H]\u2212 = 0 gives an explicit expression for the magnetization angle.\n6. Using the decouplings as well as the commutation\nproperty in the primed system we can solve the\nequation of motion and finally obtain the single\nmagnon Green function as well as the norm of the\nmagnetization hSz\u2032 i. Therewith the problem will\nbe solved.\n7. One can further show, that the effect of the\nanisotropy can be interpreted instructively as an\neffective \"anisotropy field\". We will calculate the\ncomponents of this field.\nLets now follow this program in more detail. The rotation of the coordinate system is described by \u03a3\u2032 = M \u03a3,\nwhere M is a rotation matrix. Due to the symmetry we\nmay confine the rotation to the zx-plane without loss of\ngenerality. This means that y \u2032 = y and that the polar\nangle \u03b8 fully characterizes the rotation.\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\ncos \u03b8 0 \u2212 sin \u03b8\n0 \uf8f8.\nM =\uf8ed 0 1\n(4)\nsin \u03b8 0 cos \u03b8\nThe z \u2032 -axis of the new system \u03a3\u2032 is set to be parallel to\nthe magnetization direction. This gives:\nhSx\u2032 i = hSy\u2032 i = 0.\n\n(5)\n\nThe magnetizations in the fixed system \u03a3 can now be\nread off from Eq. (4):\nhSx i = sin \u03b8hSz\u2032 i,\nhSz i = cos \u03b8hSz\u2032 i.\n\n(6)\n\nhSz i is the magnetization component normal to the film\nplane while hSx i denotes the component parallel to the\nfilm plane. hSz\u2032 i, consequently, is the total magnetization. Of course, the angle \u03b8 is a priori unknown.\nNext we want to write down the equation of motion of\nthe single magnon Green function G\u2032ij (E) = hhSi+\u2032 ; Sj\u2212\u2032 ii\ndefined in the new system. Applying the transformation\n(4) to the Hamiltonian (3) one readily finds:\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0003\nEG\u2032ij (E) = h Si+\u2032 , Sj\u2212\u2032 \u2212 i + hh Si+\u2032 , H ; Sj\u2212\u2032 ii\n\n\f3\n\n= 2hSz\u2032 i\u03b4ij \u2212 2J\n\nhlii\nX\nl\n\n\u0001\n\u0393\u2032ilj (E) \u2212 \u0393\u2032lij (E)\n\n1\n+K2 (cos2 \u03b8 \u2212 sin2 \u03b8) \u0393a\u2032\nij (E),\n2\n+(Bx0 sin \u03b8 + Bz0 cos \u03b8)G\u2032ij (E)\n\u2212(Bx0 cos \u03b8 \u2212\n\nS(x,y,z) = S(x,y,z) +\n\u0001\n\u03b1(x,y,z) S(S + 1) \u2212 Sx2 \u2212 Sy2 \u2212 Sz2 (10)\n\nIt is important to note that theses relations are identities for any (\u03b1(x,y,z) ) only for exact calculations. On\nthe contrary the result of some standard approximation\nprocedure (e.g. of a symmetric mean field decoupling)\nchanges if one uses the right hand side of Eq. (10) instead of the left hand side. The results do depend now\non the prefactors (\u03b1(x,y,z) ). It was the idea of Callen to\nuse this degree of freedom to improve approximations.\nWe will follow the proposal of Callen here and adjust\nthe parameters in a way that interpolates between zero\ntemperature and Curie temperature requirements. The\nexplicit calculation is given in Appendix A.

The combination of trigonometric functions is a\nconsequence of the rotation (4).\nTo proceed the operator products in \u0393\u2032mno and \u0393a\u2032\nij\nhave to be decoupled. For the nonlocal products in\nthe former we choose a symmetric RPA decoupling\nAB \u2192 hAiB + AhBi. Using Eq. (5) which is valid in the\nprimed system we find\nz\u2032 +\u2032 RP A\nSm\nSn \u2212\u2192\n\nhSz\u2032 iSn+\u2032\n\n(8)\n\nThis is the same result as found in the original RPA\napproach7 for the \"parallel limit\". Let us emphasize\nthat this is only the case for the primed system \u03a3\u2032 . Thus\nthe third point of our program is done.\nThe crucial fourth step introduces a new approximation scheme for the single ion anisotropy (2). It will\nbe used to decouple the higher Green function \u0393a\u2032\nij as\nwell as to treat\noperator\ncombinations\nappearing\nin\nthe\nP\ncommutator [ i Si\u1e91 , H]\u2212 . The latter is important for\nthe fifth step of our calculation.\n1963 Callen introduced the Callen decoupling9 which was\nintended as an improvement to the RPA decoupling7 .\nThe decoupling was performed at the Heisenberg exchange term (1). Later Anderson and Callen10 used\nthis proposal to treat the local anisotropy term (2)\nin the \"parallel limit\". Both approaches are based on\nthe fact that the total magnetization commutes with\nthe Hamiltonian, a condition that is not valid in our\ncase. Therefore the procedure has to be rederived and\ngeneralized. We will not quite adopt the procedure as\npresented in Ref. 9 but rather use the main ideas.\nThe approximation makes use of the operator identity\nS(S + 1) \u2212 Sx2 \u2212 Sy2 \u2212 Sz2 = 0\n\nThe spin operators work on the same site i, the site index\nis dropped here for convenience. Now the \"zero\" is added\nto the components of the spin operator, Sx , Sy , Sz :\n\n(9)\n\nhS(x,y,z) i\n(11)\n2S 2\nNow we want to decouple operator combinations like\nSx Sz + Sz Sx , Sy Sz + Sz Sy , or Sx Sy + Sy Sx which appear in the equation of motion (7) in the higher Green\nfunction \u0393a\u2032\nij . Thereto we replace the single operators\nby the right hand side of Eq. (10) and perform a symmetric decoupling procedure at the resulting expressions.\nSince the prefactors \u03b1(x,y,z) are small quantities we neglect terms of the order \u03b12 . For example the result for\nthe operator combination Sy Sz + Sz Sy is thus given by:\n\u03b1(x,y,z) =\n\nA.C.\n\nSy Sz + Sz Sy \u2212\u2192 2hSy iSz + 2hSz iSy\nhSy i \u0010\n\u22122 2 hSx Sz + Sz Sx iSx\n2S\n\n(12)\n\n\u0011\n+hSy Sz + Sz Sy iSy + 2hSz2 iSz\nhSz i \u0010\n\u22122 2 hSx Sy + Sy Sx iSx\n2S\n\u0011\n\n+2hSy2 iSy + hSz Sy + Sy Sz iSz .\n\nFor the other operator combinations analog expressions\nare found.\nBy virtue of relation (5) the result can be simplified if the\ndecoupling is performed in the rotated coordinate system\n\u03a3\u2032 . We show in Appendix B that the following relations\nare fulfilled in \u03a3\u2032 :\nhSa\u2032 Sb\u2032 + Sb\u2032 Sa\u2032 i = 0,\n\u2032\n\n(13)\n\n\u2032\n\nwhere a and b are two different subscripts out of\n(x\u2032 , y \u2032 , z \u2032 ). This, together with Eq. (5), finally gives the\ndecoupling within the parallel system \u03a3\u2032 :\nA.C.\n\nSx\u2032 Sz\u2032 + Sz\u2032 Sx\u2032 \u2212\u2192 0\nSy \u2032 Sz \u2032 + Sz \u2032 Sy \u2032\nSx \u2032 Sz \u2032 + Sz \u2032 Sx \u2032\n\n!\nhSy2\u2032 i\n\u2212\u2192 2hSz\u2032 i 1 \u2212\n* Sy \u2032\nS2\n\u0012\n\u0013\nhSx2\u2032 i\nA.C.\n\u2032\n\u2212\u2192 2hSz i 1 \u2212\n* Sx\u2032 (14)\nS2\n\nA.C.\n\n\f4\nNow the operator combination that appears in the Green\nfunction \u0393a\u2032\nij in the equation of motion (7) can be decoupled. Using Eq. (14) as well as the identity (9) one finds:\nA.C.\n\nS+\u2032 Sz\u2032 + Sz\u2032 S+\u2032 \u2212\u2192 2hSz\u2032 iC1\u2032 S+\u2032\n\n(15)\n\nwith\nC1\u2032 = 1 \u2212\n\n\u0001\n1\nS(S + 1) \u2212 hSz2\u2032 i .\n2\n2S\n\n(16)\n\nUsing the decoupling procedures discussed up to\nnow the higher Green functions \u0393\u2032mno and \u0393a\u2032\nij in the\nequation of motion (7) can be treated. To treat the\nother four terms we have to address the fifth point of\nour program. Hence we will show in the following that\nP z\u2032\nfor a certain angle \u03b8\u0302 the total magnetization\ni Si\ncommutes with the Hamiltonian (3). Furthermore an\nexplicit expression for the magnetization angle will be\nobtained.\nApplying the rotation (4) to the Hamiltonian (3) and\nusing the abbreviation \u03b31 = sin \u03b8 and \u03b32 = cos \u03b8 we find:\n#\n\"\nX\nX \u2032\n\u2032\n(\u03b31 Bz0 \u2212 \u03b32 Bx0 ) * iSiy\n=\nSiz , H\ni\n\nNow the last operator product is decoupled according to\nEq. (14). This gives:\n#\n\"\nX\u0012\nX \u2032\nz\n\u03b31 Bz0 \u2212 \u03b32 Bx0\n(17)\nSi , H\n=\ni\n\n\u2212\n\nG\u2032q (E) =\n\n2hSz\u2032 i\nE \u2212 Eq\u2032\n\nwith\nEq\u2032 = 2hSz\u2032 iJ(p \u2212 \u03b3q ) + B\nB = Bx0 sin \u03b8 + Bz0 cos \u03b8\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n2\n2\n+K2 cos \u03b8 \u2212 sin \u03b8 2hSz\u2032 iC1\u2032 . (19)\n2\nThe term p denotes the coordination number, while \u03b3q is\na structural factor due to the Fourier transformation of\nthe Heisenberg exchange term. For the quadratic lattice\nchosen here it is given by:\n\u03b3q = 2 (cos aqx + cos aqy ) ,\n\ni\n\n\u2212\n\n\u0010 \u2032 \u2032\n\u0011\n\u2032\n\u2032\n+K2 \u03b31 \u03b32 * i Siy Siz + Siz Siy\n\ni\n\nHaving calculated the magnetization angle now the\nnorm of the magnetization hSz\u2032 i has to be derived. This\nturns out to be a straightforward task. Due to the\nproperty of spin conservation in the primed system the\nGreen functions in the last four lines of the equation of\nmotion (7) are identical to zero. The remaining higher\nGreen functions \u0393\u2032mno and \u0393a\u2032\nij can be decoupled by Eqs.\n(8) and (14). Thus the equation of motion (7) can be\nsolved after Fourier transformation. We finally obtain\nthe single magnon Green function G\u2032q (E),\n\n\u0013\n\u0010\nhSy2\u2032 i \u0011\n\u2032\n* iSiy\n+2K2 \u03b31 \u03b32 hSz\u2032 i 1 \u2212\n2\nS\n\nThus, in the framework of our approximation, the total\nmagnetization indeed commutes with the Hamiltonian if\nthe term in brackets on the right hand side is zero. This\nhas important consequences: All expectation values and\nGreen functions in the rotated coordinate system \u03a3\u0302 that\ndo not conserve the spin are zero in the framework of\nour theory. This can be seen using, e.g., the Lehmann\nrepresentation of the Green function. In particular this\napplies for hS+\u2032 i and hS\u2212\u2032 i. Therefore Eq. (5) holds in\nthis coordinate system which is thus found to be equivalent to the system \u03a3\u2032 : \u03a3\u0302 = \u03a3\u2032 . Hence from Eq. (18)\nfollows simple condition for the magnetization angle \u03b8:\n!\n\n0 = sin \u03b8Bz0 \u2212 cos \u03b8Bx0\n+2K2 sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8hSz\u2032 iC1\u2032\n\n(18)\n\nThe expectation value hSy2 i is already evaluated here\nusing the property of spin conservation in the primed\nsystem. Eq. (18) is our first important result.\n\nwhere a is the lattice constant. The trigonometric\nfunctions in Eq. (19) are obviously a consequence of the\nrotation. Knowing the Green function G\u2032q (E) one can\ncalculate the desired expectation values in the primed\nsystem, i.e. the total magnetization hSz\u2032 i and hSz2\u2032 i\nby a standard text book procedure12 finally ending\nup with a self consistent system of equations. Before\ndiscussing the results of our theory in more detail\nwe want to offer an instructive interpretation of the\nwork of the anisotropy in the framework of our approximation. This will be the last point of our theory section.\nThe abbreviation B in Eq. (19) has the same effect on the Green function as an external field aligned\nparallel to the magnetization. Combining the expression\nfor B with the magnetization angle, we may write down\nthe components of the effective field:\nBx =\n=\n=\nBz =\n\nB sin \u03b8\nBx0 \u2212 K2 hSx i sin2 \u03b8C1\u2032\nBx0 + Bxa\nB cos \u03b8\n1\n= Bz0 + 2K2 hSz i(1 \u2212 sin2 \u03b8)C1\u2032\n2\n= Bz0 + Bza .\n\n(20)\n\nObviously, the effective field may be written as a sum\nof the external field and an \"anisotropy field\" Ba =\n(Bxa , 0, Bza ). The anisotropy acts exactly like this field\nas far as the magnetization and the magnon energies Eq\nare concerned.\n\n\f5\n2\n\n2\nT/TC = 0\n0\n\n\u03b8B = 90\n0\n\n1.5\n\n<Sz>, <Sx>\n\n<Sz>, <Sx>\n\n1.5 <S >\nz\n\n1\n\u25cf,\u25a0\n\n0.5\n\n<Sx>\n\n0\n0\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\n\nRPA + A.C.\nQMC\nRef. 8\nRPA + MF\n\n0.04\n\n0.05\n\n1\n\nT/TC = 0.7\n\nT/TC = 0.9\n0\n\n\u03b8B = 90\n0\n\n0.5\n\n0.06\n\n<Sz>\n<Sx>\n\n0\n0\n\n0.01\n\nFIG. 1: The x- and the z-component of the magnetization\nhSx i, hSz i as a function of the external field calculated with\nour RPA+A.C. approach (solid line), the approximation proposed in Ref. 8 (dashed line) and with a mean field decoupling of the anisotropy term (dotted line) in comparison\nwith the QMC results from Ref. 6 (symbols).

Fig. 1 shows the results for the field induced reorientation transition at finite temperatures. A positive\nanisotropy constant (K2 > 0) and an external field parallel to the film plane (\u03b8B0 = 90\u25e6 ) are considered. The external field is applied perpendicular to the easy direction\nof the magnetization, a situation representing a severe\ntest for our theory. The components of the magnetization hSx i and hSz i are shown as functions of the external\nfield. For zero field the magnetization is aligned parallel\nto the easy axis. It is fully rotated into the film plane at\nthe reorientation field Br0 . We display the results of our\ncalculations (RPA+A.C. - solid lines) and the QMC results of Ref. 6 (symbols). Additionally the results of two\nother theories are shown for comparison: For the dotted\nline the anisotropy term (2) is treated by simple mean\nfield decoupling:\nMF\n\nSiz Siz \u2212\u2192 2hSz iSiz\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\n\n0.04\n\n0.05\n\nB0/J\n\nB0/J\n\n(21)\n\nThe dashed line shows the proposal of Ref. 8.

We achieved even quantitative agreement for all magnetization angles \u03b8. The\nquality of the approximation indeed turns out to be the\nsame for all angles \u03b8, which was the aim of this paper.\nOur approach is clearly superior to the approximation\nproposed in Ref. 8, to the mean field decoupling, and to\nall other approximations shown in Fig. 11 of Ref. 6. Fig.\n1 visualizes our main result, namely that we succeeded\nto develop a theory for the extended Heisenberg model\n(3) that is as accurate as the RPA for the model (1). In\nthe following we will discuss some additional features of\nthe reorientation transition.\nIn Fig. 2 the temperature dependence of the transition is\nanalyzed. Again, the components of the magnetization\nare displayed as a function of the external field, which\nis applied in the film plane, perpendicular to the easy\ndirection. The calculations were performed for three different temperatures. Since the system is not saturated\nat finite temperatures, the total magnetization increases\nwith the external field. This is seen best after the reorientation (B0 > B0r ), where only one component of\nthe magnetization (hSx i) is present. For higher temperatures the transition as a function of the external field\nbecomes sharper. The reorientation field B0r decreases\nfaster with temperature than the zero field magnetization, reflecting the fact that the anisotropy becomes less\nimportant at higher temperatures. Another interesting\nfeature is that the x\u2212component increases linearly with\nSi+ Siz\n\nSiz Si+\n\n\f6\n2\n\n0.4\n\nT/TC = 0.7\n\n<Sz>\n\n1\n\n<Sz>\n\no\n\nK2 < 0, \u03b8B = 0\n\n<Sx>\n\n<Sx>\n\n2\n\nM\n\nB0r, Ba, M\n\n0.8\n\no\n\nK2 > 0, \u03b8B = 90\n\n<Sz>, <Sx>\n\nM /M (0) (B0x = 0)\nB0r/B0r(0)\nBaz/Baz(0) (B0x = 0)\nBax/Bax(0) (B0x = B0r)\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nT/J\n\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n0\n0\n\nB-0r/J\n\nT/TC\nFIG. 3: The magnetization, the reorientation field B0r (dots)\nand the anisotropy field Ba for \u03b8 = 0\u25e6 (dashed line) and\n\u03b8 = 90\u25e6 (dotted line) as a function of temperature. All quantities are scaled to their zero temperature value. The other\nparameters are as in Fig. 2. For Comparison scaled magnetization curves are added (solid line).\n\nthe external field until the reorientation field is reached.\nThis holds for all temperatures and is qualitatively different from the approximation proposed in Ref. 8. Qualitatively, this feature is also found in mean-field theory\nas can be seen in Fig. 1 of Ref. 14.\nThe observed behavior follows directly from Eq. (18).\nSince the external field is applied parallel to the film plane\none finds for the x-component of the magnetization hSx i:\nhSx i = sin \u03b8 hSz\u2032 i\nBx0\n.\n=\n2K2 C1\u2032 (T )\n\n(23)\n\nSince C1\u2032 (Eq.19) increases with temperature, the slope\nof hSx i is steeper for higher temperatures. Additionally,\nEq. (23) determines the reorientation field B0r . We find:\nB0r (T ) = 2K2 hSz\u2032 i(T ) C1\u2032 (T ).\n\n(24)\n\nThe fast decay of the reorientation field with temperature as compared to the magnetization is also due to the\ntemperature dependence of C1\u2032 .\nThis can also be seen in Fig. 3, where we considered\nthe temperature dependence of the system in detail. We\nplotted the norm of the components of the anisotropy\nfield (20) as well the reorientation field (circles) and the\nmagnetization (solid line) as a function of temperature.\nAll quantities are scaled to their zero temperature value.\nThe anisotropy fields are plotted at their maxima, i.e. at\n\u03b8 = 0\u25e6 for Baz (dashed line) and at \u03b8 = 90\u25e6 for Bax (dotted line). The temperature dependence of the anisotropy\nfields (20) as well as of the reorientation field (24) are determined by the factor hSz\u2032 i(T ) C1\u2032 (T ). Thus this quantities have nearly the same temperature dependence and\ntheir slopes are steeper than that of the magnetization\n\nB+0r/J\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\nB0/J\n\nFIG. 4: The z\u2212 and x\u2212component of the magnetization as a\nfunction of the external field.

The small arrows highlight the position\n+\n\u2212\nof the reorientation fields B0r\nfor positive and B0r\nfor negative anisotropy. The inset shows the magnetization curves for\nB0 = 0. The other parameters are as in Fig. 2.\n\nhSz\u2032 i(T ) alone.\nVery similar results are found for the easy plane case\n(K2 < 0, B0 kz). In Fig. 4 we compare both cases of a\nreorientation transition. Solid lines show the transition\nfor an easy axis system, dashed lines denote the easy\nplane case. In the inset, the respective magnetization\ncurves M (T ) = hSz\u2032 i(T ) are plotted for zero external\nfield. The Curie temperature and the magnetization at\nfinite temperatures are somewhat smaller for the easy\nplane system. A reduced magnetization leads to a reduced reorientation field (see Eq. (24)). This explains\nthe differences between both cases concerning the reorientation transition as seen in the main panel.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK\n\nIn this paper we addressed the magnetic reorientation\ntransition in a Heisenberg monolayer as a function of\nthe external field and temperature. The basis of our\napproach is a transformation of the Hamiltonian into a\ncoordinate system \u03a3\u2032 (with the z \u2032 axis parallel to the\nmagnetization) as well as a generalized Anderson-Callen\ndecoupling procedure. Compared to the bare Heisenberg\nHamiltonian (1), the problem is more complicated,\nsince the total spin is not conserved. However, this\ncomplication turns out to be less serious, as it can be\nshown that the total spin is a conserved quantity in\nthe framework of our approximation, if a appropriate\nquantization axis is chosen. This fact can be used to\ncalculate the magnetization angle as well as to solve\nthe equation of motion for the single magnon Green\nfunction. It was further shown that the effect of the\n\n\f7\nanisotropy can be described by an effective \"anisotropy\nfield\".\nOur results show a strikingly quantitative agreement\nwith the QMC data of Ref. 6 yielding a significant improvement over all other decoupling schemes discussed\nso far (see e.g. Ref. 6). The main practical virtue of the\nnew approach is that calculations can be performed as\naccurate as with QMC but much faster.\nThe theory can be generalized to a multilayer system\nand can thus be used for cases where QMC calculations\nare not feasible any more (e.g. thicker films). It should\ntherefore be used to analyze the magnetic reorientation\ntransition as a function of the film thickness as found in\nmany transition metal films (see e.g. Ref. 4).\nDue to its accuracy and convenience the theory shall\nfurther be used for a quantitative analysis of ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) experiments15,16 . The decisive\nfeature for the interpretation of a FMR experiment is\nthe dependence of the q = 0 spin wave mode Eq=0 on\nthe external field B0 . The function Eq=0 (B0 ) can be\neasily calculated in our theory for any direction of the\nexternal field. This opens the possibility to extract the\nmicroscopic anisotropy constant K2 directly from FMR\nexperiments.\n\nIf \u03b1z is set to zero, the left hand side and the right hand\nside of Eq. (25) are approximated on the same level,\ni.e. the expectation values at low temperatures are replaced by their zero temperature value. However one can\neven improve the approximation for the left hand side by\nchoosing \u03b1z adequately. The choice\n!\n\n\u03b1z (T \u2248 0) =\n\ncos \u03b8\n2S\n\nrecovers the free spin wave result\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nhS\u2212\u2032 S+\u2032 i\nhSz i \u2248 cos \u03b8 S \u2212\n2S\n\n!\n\n\u03b1z (T > Tc ) \u223c cos \u03b8hSz\u2032 i.\n\nThis work is supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft within the Sonderforschungsbereich 290.\nAppendix A\n\nIn this Appendix we derive the prefactors of Eq. (10).\nWe follow the philosophy of Callens paper9 and calculate\nthe prefactors as an interpolation between low and high\ntemperatures. Lets start with the former limit T \u2248 0:\nStarting point is Eq. (10). We will consider expectation\nvalues instead of operators and transform the resulting\nexpression as:\nhSz i = hSz i + \u03b1z hS(S + 1) \u2212 Sx2 \u2212 Sy2 \u2212 Sz2 i\n= hSz i + \u03b1z hS(S + 1) \u2212 Sx2\u2032 \u2212 Sy2\u2032 \u2212 Sz2\u2032 i\n= hSz i\n+\u03b1z hS(S + 1) \u2212 Sz\u2032 \u2212 S\u2212\u2032 S+\u2032 \u2212 Sz2\u2032 i (25)\nThe primed terms are quantities of the rotated system\nwhich is aligned parallel to the magnetization. Now the\nexpectation values of the right hand side are approximated by their zero temperature values\n\nCombining the settings (28) and (30) one ends up with\nEq.

First we want to calculate the expectation\nvalue hSx\u2032 Sy\u2032 + Sy\u2032 Sx\u2032 i. Using the decoupling (12) together with Eq.
