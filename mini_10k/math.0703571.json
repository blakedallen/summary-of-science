This is an outcome of the investigation commenced with the parts XII and\nXIV, where a framework was laid on the basis of the theory of automorphic representations and a general\napproach to the mean values was envisaged. We restrict ourselves to the situation offered by the full modular\ngroup, solely for the sake of simplicity. Details and extensions are to be published elsewhere.\nKeywords: Mean values of automorphic L-functions; automorphic representations; Kirillov model.\n1. To begin with, we stress that all notations\nand conventions will stay effective once introduced.\nLet G = PSL(2, R) and \u0393 = PSL(2, Z). Write\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\u221a\n\u0015\n1 x\ny\n\u221a ,\nn[x] =\n, a[y] =\n1\n1/ y\n\u0014\n\u0015\ncos \u03b8 sin \u03b8\nk[\u03b8] =\n,\n\u2212 sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8\n\nThe cuspidal subspace decomposes into irreducible subspaces\n0 2\n\nL (\u0393 \\G) =\n\nL\nV.\n\nThe operator \u03a9 becomes a constant\n\u0001 multiplication in\neach V so that \u03a9|V \u221e = \u03bdV2 \u2212 14 *1, where V \u221e is the\nset of all infinitely differentiable vectors in V . Under our present supposition, V belongs to either the\nunitary principal series or the discrete series; accordingly, we have \u03bdV \u2208 iR or \u03bdV = l \u2212 12 (1 \u2264 l \u2208 Z).\nThe right action of K induces the decomposition\nof V into K-irreducible subspaces\n\nand N = {n[x] : x \u2208 R}, A = {a[y] : y > 0}, K =\n{k[\u03b8] : \u03b8 \u2208 R/\u03c0Z} , so that G = NAK is the Iwasawa\ndecomposition of the Lie group G. We read it as\nG \u220b g = nak = n[x]a[y]k[\u03b8]. The coordinate (x, y, \u03b8)\nwill retain this definition. The center of the universal\nenveloping algebra of G is the polynomial\nring on the\n\u0001\nCasimir element \u03a9 = y 2 \u2202x2 + \u2202y2 \u2212y\u2202x \u2202\u03b8 . The Haar\nmeasures on the groups N, A, K, G are normalized,\nrespectively, by dn = dx, da = dy/y, dk = d\u03b8/\u03c0,\ndg = dndadk/y, with Lebesgue measures dx, dy, d\u03b8.\nThe space L2 (\u0393 \\G) is composed of all left \u0393 automorphic functions on G, vectors for short, which\nare square integrable over \u0393 \\G against dg. Elements\nof G act unitarily on vectors from the right. We have\nthe orthogonal decomposition\nL\nL\nL2 (\u0393 \\G) = C*1 0L2 (\u0393 \\G) eL2 (\u0393 \\G)\n\n\u221e\nL\n\nV =\n\nVp ,\n\np=\u2212\u221e\n\ndim Vp \u2264 1.\n\nIf it is not trivial, Vp is spanned by a \u0393 -automorphic\nfunction on which the right translation by k[\u03b8] becomes the multiplication by the factor exp(2ip\u03b8). It\nis called a \u0393 -automorphic form of spectral parameter\n\u03bdV and weight 2p.\nLet V be in the unitary principal series. Then\ndim Vp = 1 for all p \u2208 Z and there exists a complete\northonormal system {\u03c6p \u2208 Vp : p \u2208 Z} of V such\nthat\n\ninto invariant subspaces. Here 0L2 is the cuspidal\nsubspace spanned by vectors whose Fourier expansions with respect to the left action of N have vanishing constant terms. The subspace eL2 is spanned\nby integrals of Eisenstein series. Invariant subspaces\nof L2 (\u0393 \\G) and \u0393 -automorphic representations of\nG are interchangeable concepts, and we shall refer\nto them in a mixed way.\n\n\u03c6p (g, V ) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\u033aV (n) sgn(n)\np A\n\u03c6p (a[|n|]g; \u03bdV ),\n|n|\nn=\u2212\u221e\nn6=0\n\n1\n\nwhere \u03c6p (g; \u03bd) = y \u03bd+ 2 exp(2ip\u03b8), and\nA\u03b4 \u03c6p (g; \u03bd) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification: 11F70\n\u2217)\nDepartment of Mathematics, Nihon University, Surugadai, Tokyo 101-8308.\n\n1\n\nexp(\u22122\u03c0i\u03b4x)\u03c6p (wn[x]g; \u03bd)dx,\n\n\f2\n\nY. Motohashi\n\n\u0002 \u0003\nwith w = k 12 \u03c0 the Weyl element. Our normalization is such that the coefficients \u033aV (n) do not depend on the weight. Also we may impose the Hecke\ninvariance; in particular \u033aV (\u2212n) = \u01ebV \u033aV (n) with\n\u01ebV = \u00b11.\nWe have skipped the discrete series. In the sequel as well, we shall argue as if there were no discrete series representations. This should not cause\nany confusion, as the discussions below, especially\nthose pertaining estimations, extend readily to the\ndiscrete series. Nevertheless, it should be remarked\nthat the definition of \u03c6p (g, V ) given above has to be\nmodified for those V in the discrete series according\nto the normalization [2, (2.21) and (2.25)].\nOur discussion depends much on the uniform\nbounds for A\u03c6p (a[y], \u03bd), A = A+ , such as [2, (4.3)\nand (4.5)]. In order to make our argument applicable\nto any cuspidal representations, we derive from the\nlatter a bound that is somewhat weaker than the\nformer but is still sufficient for our purpose; in fact\nthe proof of [2, (4.5)] works for all cases. We thus\nput\n\u0393p (s, \u03bd) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ny s\u22121 A\u03c6p (a[y], \u03bd)\n\n0\n\ndy\n,\ny\n\nRe s > 1;\n\nwe have shifted the argument in [2, (4.10)] by \u2212 21 .\nLet us assume that \u03bd \u2208 iR. We divide the integral\nat y = |p| + |\u03bd| + 1. To the part with smaller y\nwe apply the fact that Asgn(u) \u03c6p (a[|u|]; \u03bd) is a unit\nvector in L2 (R\u00d7, d\u00d7/\u03c0), d\u00d7u = du/|u| (see e.g., [2,\nLemma 4]). Hence this part is \u226a (|p| + |\u03bd| + 1)Re s\u22121 .\nOn the other hand, by [2, (4.5)] the remaining part is\n1\n\u226a (|p| + |\u03bd| + 1)Re s\u2212 2 . We then invoke the identity\n\u0393p (s, \u03bd) = 4\u03c0 *\n\n\u03c0\u0393p (s + 2, \u03bd) \u2212 p\u0393p (s + 1, \u03bd)\n,\n(s \u2212 12 )2 \u2212 \u03bd 2\n\nwhich can be proved by applying\nthe operator D\u03bd =\n\u0001\n(d/dy)2 \u2212 (2\u03c0)2 \u2212 \u03bd 2 \u2212 14 y \u22122 either to y s or to\nA\u03c6p (a[y], \u03bd) in the last integral, on noting that the\nlatter is a constant multiple of the Whittaker function Wp,\u03bd (4\u03c0y) (see [2, (2.16)]). Then, by Mellin's in1\nversion, we conclude that A\u03c6p (a[y], \u03bd) \u226a y 2 \u2212\u03b5 (|p| +\n|\u03bd| + 1)2+\u03b5 for any small \u03b5 > 0.\nThe above works with \u03bd = l \u2212 21 , the discrete\nseries, as well. We remark that D\u03bd is related to the\noperator \u2202\u03b8 via the Kirillov map. Hereafter we shall\nterm [2, (4.5)] and the bound thus obtained the basic\nbounds.\n\n2. We now define the automorphic L-function\nassociated with an irreducible \u0393 -automorphic representation V by\nLV (s) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u033aV (n)n\u2212s .\n\nn=1\n\nThis converges absolutely for Re s > 1 and continues\nto an entire function which is of a polynomial order\nboth in s and in \u03bdV if Re s is bounded.\nWe fix an A among V 's, and consider the mean\nsquare\nZ \u221e\n\u00012\nM(A, g) =\nL 12 + it g(t)dt, L = LA ,\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere the weight function g is assumed, for the sake\nof simplicity but without much loss of generality,\nto be even, entire, real on R, and of fast decay in\nany fixed horizontal strip. Our aim is to establish a\nfull spectral decomposition of M(A, g). Our method\nis applicable to any representation, though we shall\ndeal with only those A in the unitary principal series.\nWith a minor modification, the fourth moment of the\nRiemann zeta-function could be discussed equally.\nWe start as usual with the integral\nZ \u221e\nI(u, v; g) =\nL(\u016b + it)L(v + it)g(t)dt.\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThis is an entire function of u, v; in particular\n\u0001\nM(A, g) = I 21 , 12 ; g .\n\nIn the region of absolute convergence we have\nI(u, v; g) =\n\nR(u + v)\n\u011d(0) + J(u, v; g) + J(v\u0304, \u016b; g),\n\u03b6(2(u + v))\n\nwhere R is the Rankin zeta-function attached to A,\n\u011d the Fourier transform of g, and\n\u221e\n\u221e X\nX\n\u033a(n)\u033a(n + f )\n(2n + f )u+v\nf =1 n=1\n!2\u03b1\np\nn(n + f )\ng\u0303(f /(2n + f ); u, v),\n2n + f\n\nJ(u, v; g) =\n\n*\n\nwhere \u033a = \u033aA and\ng\u0303(x; u, v) = 2u+v+2\u03b1\n\n\u011d(log((1 + x)/(1 \u2212 x)))\n,\n(1 \u2212 x)u+\u03b1 (1 + x)v+\u03b1\n\n\f3\n\nA note on the mean value of the zeta and L-functions. XV\n\nwith 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1. Here \u03b1 is a sufficiently large positive integer, which is implicit throughout the sequel.\nNote that we have slightly modified our procedure\ngiven in [6].\nLet g \u2217 be the Mellin transform of g\u0303. It is immediate to see that g \u2217 (s; u, v) is of rapid decay with\nrespect to s, provided Re s and u, v are bounded;\nmoreover, g \u2217 (s; u, v)/\u0393(s) is entire over C3 . Thus,\nby Mellin's inversion,\nJ(u, v; g)\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f1\nZ \uf8f2X\n\u221e\n\uf8fd\n1\n=\nf \u2212s Df (u + v \u2212 s) g \u2217 (s; u, v)ds,\n\uf8fe\n2\u03c0i (\u03b7) \uf8f3\nf =1\n\nwhere (\u03b7) is the line Re s = \u03b7 > 0, and\n\u221e\nX\n\u033a(n)\u033a(n + f )\nDf (s) =\n(2n + f )s\nn=1\n\n!2\u03b1\np\nn(n + f )\n.\n2n + f\n\nChecking the convergence, we see that the condition\nRe (u + v) > max{2, 1 + \u03b7} is required here.\n3. Now, we need to have a full spectral decomposition of Df (s) which is to yield a continuation,\nwith a polynomial growth, to the domain Re s > \u031f\nwith a \u031f < 1 so that J(u, v; g) can also\n\u0001 be continued\nto a neighbourhood of the point 21 , 21 . Recently, V.\nBlomer and G. Harcos [1] succeeded in establishing\nsuch an assertion on Df (s). They started with an old\nidea of ours, published in [6], to employ the Kirillov\nmodel to pick up a favourable automorphic form in\ndealing with the problem of the spectral decomposition of Df (s), and proceeded one step further by a\nuse of the theory of the Sobolev norms with which\nthey could derive the crucial polynomial growth that\nwe had left open in [6].\nIn what follows, we shall take an alternative way\nby modifying [6] with certain simple devices from [2],\n[5], and by reworking our relevant unpublished notes.\nThe present article can be read independently of [1].\nThus, let A, \u03b1 be as above, and \u03c4 a parameter in the right half plane; all implicit constants in\nthe sequel may depend on A, \u03b1 and Re \u03c4 at most.\nWe apply the inverse Kirillov map to the function\n1\nw(y, \u03c4 ) which is equal to y \u03b1+ 2 exp(\u2212\u03c4 y) for y > 0,\nand vanishes for y \u2264 0. By [2, Lemma 4] or [6,\nLemma 1], there exists an automorphic form \u03a6(g, \u03c4 )\nin the subspace A such that\n\u03a6(n[x]a[y], \u03c4 ) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\u033a(n)\n\u221a w(ny, \u03c4 ) exp(2\u03c0inx).\nn\nn=1\n\nMore precisely,\n\u03a6(g, \u03c4 ) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nap (\u03c4 )\u03c6p (g, A),\n\np=\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere\nap (\u03c4 ) =\n\n1\n\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nw\u03b1 (y, \u03c4 )A\u03c6p (a[y]; \u03bdA )\n\n0\n\ndy\n.\ny\n\nThe function \u03a6(g, \u03c4 ) is regular for Re \u03c4 > 0. In fact,\nwe have\nap (\u03c4 ) \u226a (|\u03c4 | + 1)2\u03b1 (|p| + 1)\u2212\u03b1 ;\nand for any g it holds that \u03c6p (g, A) \u226a (|p| + 1)2 , by\n[2, (4.5)] applied to A\u03c6p (a[y]; \u03bdA ).\nTo prove the bound for ap (\u03c4 ), we use the operator D\u03bd again: we have, for p 6= 0,\nZ \u221e\n1\nap (\u03c4 ) = \u2212 2\nw\u03b1 (y, \u03c4 )D\u03bdA A\u03c6p (a[y]; \u03bdA ) dy,\n4\u03c0 p 0\nIntegrate in parts, and repeat the procedure as long\nas the resulting integrand vanishes at y = 0, that is,\n\u03b1 times at least, and we get the bound. The case\np = 0 can be skipped obviously.\n4. Next, we put \u03a8(g, \u03c4 ) = \u03a6(g, \u03c4 )\u03a6(g, \u03c4 ); this is\nregular for Re \u03c4 > 0. We have, for any integer f \u2265 0,\nZ 1\n\u03a8(n[x]a[y], \u03c4 ) exp(\u22122\u03c0if x)dx\n0\n\n=y\n\n2\u03b1+1\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u033a(n)\u033a(n + f )(n(n + f ))\u03b1\n\nn=1\n\n* exp(\u2212(2n + f )\u03c4 y).\nThe Parseval formula implies that the left side is\nequal to\nX \u033aV (f )\n\u221a \u2206(f y, \u03c4 ; V )\nf\nV\nZ\nd\u03bd\nf \u2212\u03bd \u03c32\u03bd (f )\n\u221a\n\u2206(f y, \u03c4 ; \u03bd)\n,\n+\n4\u03c0i\nf \u03b6(1 + 2\u03bd)\n(0)\nwhere V runs over all irreducible cuspidal representations, and\n\u2206(y, \u03c4 ; V ) =\n\u2206(y, \u03c4 ; \u03bd) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nh\u03a8(*, \u03c4 ), \u03c6p (*, V )iA\u03c6p (a[y]; \u03bdV ),\n\np=\u2212\u221e\n\u221e\nX\n\nh\u03a8(*, \u03c4 ), Ep (*, \u03bd)iA\u03c6p (a[y]; \u03bd).\n\np=\u2212\u221e\n\n\f4\n\nY. Motohashi\n\nHere h , i is the natural inner product on L2 (\u0393 \\G),\nand Ep is the Eisenstein series of weight 2p (see [2,\n(3.19)]).\nThe convergence of the spectral expansion of \u03a8\nis in fact absolute and fast, provided \u03b1 is sufficiently\nlarge. To confirm this, we apply the operator \u03a9+ i\u2202\u03b82\nrepeatedly as is done at [2, (5.9)]; and we get, via the\nabove bound for ap (\u03c4 ),\n1\n\nh\u03a8(*, \u03c4 ), \u03c6p (*, V )i \u226a (|\u03c4 | + 1)4\u03b1 (|\u03bdV | + |p|)\u2212 2 \u03b1 ,\n\nwith the Maass operator E = e2i\u03b8 (2iy\u2202x + 2y\u2202y \u2212\ni\u2202\u03b8 ), we see that \u03a9\u03c6k \u03c6l is a linear combination of\n\u03c6k+j \u03c6l+j , j = \u22121, 0, 1, the coefficients of which are\npolynomials of the second degree on k, l; note that\n\u03bdA is now regarded as a constant. Thus\n(\u03a9 +\n\ni\u2202\u03b82 )q \u03c6k \u03c6l\n\n=\n\nwhere dj (k, l; q) are polynomials of degree 2q on k, l;\nand\n(\u03a9 + i\u2202\u03b82 )q \u03a8(g, \u03c4 ) =\n\n1\n1\n\u221a\n\u226a (|\u03c4 | + 1)4\u03b1 (|\u03bdV | + 1)\u2212 4 \u03b1 y 2 \u2212\u03b5 exp(\u2212 y).\n\nThe contribution of the continuous spectrum or rather the function \u2206(y, \u03c4 ; \u03bd) is to be discussed later.\nThis yields our assertion. Note that \u2206(y, \u03c4 ; *) is regular for Re \u03c4 > 0.\nIn order to pick up a particular Fourier coefficient, we have used the projection procedure as\nBlomer and Harcos did in [1] to avoid an inner product argument that was applied in [6]. It is worth\npointing it out that in [2, Sections 3\u20135] a procedure\nof the same kind was developed, employing the Kirillov model as a main implement to evaluate projections of a certain Poincar\u00e9 series explicitly in terms\nof its seed function. Therefore, we surmise that the\nprojections \u2206(y, \u03c4 ; *) could also be handled more precisely with a modification of the argument of [2]. To\nthis issue we shall return elsewhere.\n\n\u22122q\n\n\u226a (|\u03bdV | + |p|)\n\n(\u03a9 +\n\n\u03a8(g, \u03c4 ) =\n\n\u221e\n\u221e X\nX\n\nak (\u03c4 )al (\u03c4\u0304 )\u03c6k (g)\u03c6l (g)\n\nbk,l (\u03c4 ; q) =\n\n\u03a9=\n\n1\n4 EE\n\n\u2212\n\n1 2\n4 \u2202\u03b8\n\n+\n\n1\n2 i\u2202\u03b8 ,\n\nq\nX\n\ndj (k + j, l + j; q)ak+j (\u03c4 )al+j (\u03c4\u0304 )\n\nj=\u2212q\n\n\u226a (|k| + |l| + 1)2q\n\n(|\u03c4 | + 1)4\u03b1\n,\n((|k| + 1)(|l| + 1))\u03b1\n\nfor each fixed q. We then note as\u0002 before\n\u0003 that \u03c6k (g) \u226a\n(|k| + 1)2 ; and thus, with q = 13 \u03b1 , say, we get the\nuniform bound\n(\u03a9 + i\u2202\u03b82 )q \u03a8(g, \u03c4 ) \u226a (|\u03c4 | + 1)4\u03b1 ,\nwhich gives the first inequality in the last section.\n6. As to the continuous spectrum, we invoke the\nfunctional equation for Ep ([2, (3.33)]), and have, for\nRe \u03bd = 0,\nh(\u03a9 + i\u2202\u03b82 )q \u03a8(*, \u03c4 ), Ep (*, \u03bd)i\nZ\n(\u03a9 + i\u2202\u03b82 )q \u03a8(g, \u03c4 )E\u2212p (g, \u03bd)dg,\n= \u03b3p (\u03bd)\n\u0393 \\G\n\nwith\n\u03b3p (\u03bd) = \u03c0\n\n\u22122\u03bd\n\n\u03b6(1 + 2\u03bd) \u0393\n\u03b6(1 \u2212 2\u03bd) \u0393\n\n1\n2\n1\n2\n\n\u0001\n+\u03bd +p\n\u0001.\n\u2212\u03bd +p\n\nAssuming Re \u03bd > 21 , we unfold\n\u0001 the last integral,\nand see that it equals R \u03bd + 12 Yp (\u03bd, \u03c4 ; q)/\u03b6(2\u03bd + 1),\nwhere R is as above, and\n\nk=1 l=1\n\nwith \u03c6k (g) = \u03c6k (g, A), \u03c6l (g) = \u03c6l (g, A).

We are now to make the last estimation procedure explicit. Thus, we note that\nh\u03a8(*, \u03c4 ), \u03c6p (*, V )i\n1\n=\nh(\u03a9 + i\u2202\u03b82 )q \u03a8(*, \u03c4 ), \u03c6p (*, V )i\n(\u03bdV 2 \u2212 41 \u2212 i(2p)2 )q\n\ndj (k, l; q)\u03c6k+j \u03c6l+j ,\n\nj=\u2212q\n\nThen we appeal to the basic bounds, getting\n\u2206(y, \u03c4 ; V )\n\nq\nX\n\nYp (\u03bd, \u03c4 ; q) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nbl+p,l (\u03c4 ; q)\n\nl=\u2212\u221e\n\n*\n\nXZ\n\n\u03b4=\u00b1\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n3\n\nA\u03b4 \u03c6l+p (a[y], \u03bdA )A\u03b4 \u03c6l (a[y], \u03bdA )y \u03bd\u2212 2 dy.\n\n\f5\n\nA note on the mean value of the zeta and L-functions. XV\n\nAgain by the basic bounds, we see that Yp (\u03bd, \u03c4 ; q) is\nregular and \u226a (|\u03c4 | + 1)4\u03b1 for Re \u03c4 > 0 and Re \u03bd >\n\u2212 21 . Hence, in the same domain,\n\u0001\nR \u03bd + 12\n\u2206(y, \u03c4 ; \u03bd) =\n\u039b(y, \u03c4 ; \u03bd),\n\u03b6(1 \u2212 2\u03bd)\nwith\n\u221e\nX\n\nYp (\u03bd, \u03c4 ; q)\n\u0001\n2 \u2212 1 \u2212 i(2p)2 q\n\u03bd\n4\np=\u2212\u221e\n\u0001\n\u0393 12 + \u03bd + p\n\u0001 A\u03c6p (a[y]; \u03bd).\n*\n\u0393 21 \u2212 \u03bd + p\n\n\u039b(y, \u03c4 ; \u03bd) =\u03c0 \u22122\u03bd\n\nadopted an old idea of Ju.V. Linnik which he introduced in his investigation on approximate functional\nequations for Dirichlet L-functions. The introduction of the parameter \u03c4 was made with this effect in\nmind.\n8. We return to the function J(u, v; g); thus we\nimpose Re (u + v) > max{2, 1 + \u03b7} initially. In view\nof the fast decay of g \u2217 (s; u, v), the last assertion on\nDf (s) yields immediately that\nJ(u, v; g) =\n\n1\n1\n\u221a\n\u226a (|\u03c4 | + 1)4\u03b1 (|\u03bd| + 1)\u2212 4 \u03b1 y 2 \u2212|Re \u03bd|\u2212\u03b5 exp(\u2212 y)\n\nfor Re \u03c4 > 0 and Re \u03bd > \u2212 21 .\n7. We now set \u03c4 = s, and observe that\ns+2\u03b1\n\nDf (s) =\n\ns\n\u0393(s + 2\u03b1)\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ny s\u22122\n\n0\n\nZ 1\n*\n\u03a8(n[x]a[y], s) exp(2\u03c0if x)dxdy\n0\nX 1\n=\nf 2 \u2212s \u033aV (f )\u039e(s, V )\nV\n\n+\n\nZ\n\n(0)\n\n1\n\u0001\nd\u03bd\nf 2 \u2212\u03bd \u03c32\u03bd (f )\nR \u03bd + 21 \u039e(s, \u03bd)\n,\n\u03b6(1 + 2\u03bd)\u03b6(1 \u2212 2\u03bd)\n4\u03c0i\n\nwhere\ns+2\u03b1\n\n+\n\n1\n4\u03c0i\n\nThe bound for \u2206(y, \u03c4 ; V ) implies that \u039e(s, V ) is reg1\n1\nular and \u226a |s|4\u03b1+ 2 (|\u03bdV | + 1)\u2212 2 \u03b1 for Re s > 12 . Sim1\n1\nilarly, \u039e(s, \u03bd) is regular and \u226a |s|4\u03b1+ 2 (|\u03bd| + 1)\u2212 2 \u03b1\n1\n1\nfor Re s > 2 + |Re \u03bd| and Re \u03bd > \u2212 2 .\nTherefore we have proved that Df (s) is indeed\nregular and of polynomial growth for Re s > 21 ([1,\nTheorem 2]).\nIt is to be observed that in order to offset the\nexponential growth of the factor 1/\u0393(s+2\u03b1) we have\n\nZ\n\n(0)\n\nwhere\n\u0398(u, v; V ; g) =\n\n1\n2\u03c0i\n\nZ\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0398(u, v; V ; g)\n\n\u03b6(u + v \u2212 12 + \u03bd)\u03b6(u + v \u2212 12 \u2212 \u03bd)\n\u03b6(1 + 2\u03bd)\u03b6(1 \u2212 2\u03bd)\n\u0001\n* R \u03bd + 21 \u0398(u, v; \u03bd; g)d\u03bd,\n\n(\u03b7)\n\n\u039e(u + v \u2212 \u03be, V )g \u2217 (\u03be; u, v)d\u03be,\n\nand the factor \u039e(u + v \u2212 \u03be, \u03bd) appears instead in the\ncontinuous spectrum. The \u0398 is of fast decay either\nin \u03bdV or in \u03bd, as \u039e is.\nWe fix a sufficiently small \u03b5 > 0; we may move\nthe last contour to (\u03b5), provided Re (u + v) > 32 , say.\nHence, the last expansion of J(u, v; g) holds under\nRe (u + v) > 32 . This lower\u0001 bound is required to\n\u0001\nget the factors LV u + v \u2212 21 and \u03b6 u + v \u2212 21 \u00b1 \u03bd .\nHowever, the former is entire and of a polynomial\norder in \u03bdV if u, v are bounded. Thus the cuspidal\npart of J(u,\u0001v; g) is regular in a neighbourhood of the\npoint 12 , 12 at which it takes the value\nX\n\n\u221e\n\ns\n\u039e(s, V ) =\ny s\u22122 \u2206(y, s; V )dy,\n\u0393(s + 2\u03b1) 0\nZ \u221e\nss+2\u03b1\ny s\u22122 \u039b(y, s; \u03bd)dy.\n\u039e(s, \u03bd) =\n\u0393(s + 2\u03b1) 0\nZ\n\nLV u + v \u2212\n\nV\n\nOne may conclude, via [2, (4.3) and (4.5)], that\n\u039b(y, \u03c4 ; \u03bd)\n\nX\n\nV\n\nLV\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0398A (V ; g),\n\n\u0001\nwith \u0398A (V ; g) = \u0398 21 , 21 ; V ; g .\nAs we are about to deal with the continuous\nspectrum, we should remark that \u0398(u, v; \u03bd; g) remains regular in the three complex variables and of\nfast decay in \u03bd, throughout the procedure below, because of the property of \u039e(s, \u03bd) mentioned above.\nThus, we restrict (u, v) so that 2 > Re (u + v) > 32 .\nThen, in the last expression\u0001 for J(u, v; g) one may\nshift the \u03bd-contour to 12 + \u03b5 , encountering the pole\nat u + v \u2212 32 with the residue\n\u2212\n\n\u0001\nR(u + v \u2212 1)\n\u0398 u, v; u + v \u2212 23 ; g\n\u03b6(2(2 \u2212 u \u2212 v))\n\n\f6\n\nY. Motohashi\n\nas well as those of the factor R(\u03bd + 21 )/\u03b6(1 \u2212 2\u03bd);\nwe may assume, without loss of any generality, that\nu, v are such that all the residues in question are\nfinite. This yields a meromorphic continuation of\nthe continuous spectrum\npart, so that one may move\n\u0001\n(u, v) close to 12 , 12 as far as Re (u + v) > 1 is satisfied; this condition is needed to have the last \u0398\nfactor defined well. Then, shift the \u03bd-contour back\nto the original. All the residual contribution coming from R(\u03bd + 12 )/\u03b6(1 \u2212 2\u03bd) cancel out those arising\nfrom the previous shift of the contour. Only the\npole at 32 \u2212 u \u2212 v contributes \u0001newly. The resulting integral is regular \u0001at 21 , 12 ; we get the factor\n\u0398A (\u03bd; g) = \u0398 12 , 12 ; \u03bd; g , Re \u03bd = 0.\n9. Collecting all the above, we obtain\nTheorem.

The construction of the\ntransform \u0398A (*; g) has to be made explicit in terms\nof the weight function g before one attempts any application; we shall take this task in our forthcoming\nworks. Nevertheless, the present work could be a\nmeans to broaden the perspective of the theory of\nthe mean values of the zeta and L-functions that is\nrendered in [7] via particular examples.\nAcknowledgement.
