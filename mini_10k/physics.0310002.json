Such materials were first considered theoretically by Veselago [2],\nwho predicted negative refraction at the interface between LHM and conventional dielectric, inverse Doppler\nand inverse Vavilov-Cherenkov effects. Although LHMs\ndo not exist in nature, artificial metallic composites [1]\ncan effectively be described as materials having both dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability negative\nin the microwave frequency range. Nowadays, the efforts\nhave been made to design LHMs for optical frequencies\nusing metallic nanowires [3]. Additionally, it was shown\nthat photonic crystals demonstrate negative refraction\nunder some conditions [4, 5], thus resembling the most\nfamous feature of LHMs.\nIn 1960's Veselago predicted that a slab of LHM with\nsome particular parameters surrounded by usual dielectric can focus light emitted by a point source located at\none side of the slab to the point image on the other side of\nthe slab [2]. Later, Pendry suggested [6] that such a lens\ncan focus not only propagating waves, but also evanescent waves, thus creating a perfect image of the source.\nAlthough, hot debates on the possibility to create such\na perfect lens followed this suggestion (see, e.g. [7]), it\nis clear that the planar structures containing LHMs have\na high potential for the future image processing applications. In particular, it was already shown, that the\nperiodic structure of alternating layers of negative refraction material and dielectric possesses an unusual bandgap structure [8, 9], when the average refractive index on\nthe structural period is equal to zero, and it can be used\nfor the complex beam shaping [9].\nRecent studies of the waveguiding by the structures\nwith LHMs have shown that the properties of guided\nmodes in such systems differ essentially from those of\nconventional waveguides. So far, linear waves guided by\nan interface and by a slab of LHM (see, e.g. [10, 11]) as\nwell as nonlinear surface waves [12] have been studied. It\nhas been shown that the mode structure and frequency\ndispersion may have an unconventional form and unexpected properties.\nThe study of linear waves of a LH slab waveguide [11]\n\nhas shown some of their peculiar properties, such as the\nabsence of the fundamental mode, mode double degeneracy, and the existence of both forward and backward\nwaves. In this paper, we study nonlinear guided modes in\na waveguide formed by a slab of linear LHM embedded\ninto nonlinear dielectric, and we show that symmetric,\nantisymmetric and asymmetric waves are supported by\nsuch a waveguide, and we study their properties. We\npredict, that in nonlinear regime additional modes which\ndo not exist in linear problem appear. We demonstrate\nthat the propagation of the wavefronts (characterized by\nthe phase velocity) with respect to the direction of the\nenergy flow (Poynting vector) depends on the propagation constant, and the waves can be both forward and\nbackward travelling.\nTo study nonlinear guided waves in a nonlinear waveguide, we consider a LH slab with real negative dielectric\npermittivity \u01eb2 and real negative magnetic permeability\n\u03bc2 surrounded by a nonlinear dielectric [see inset in Fig.\n1(a)] with constant magnetic permeability \u03bc1 and dielectric permittivity \u01eb1 depending on the intensity of the electric field\n\u0001\n(1)\n\u01eb1 |E|2 = \u01eb1 + \u03b1|E|2 ,\nwhere we assume \u03b1 > 0 which corresponds to the\nself-focusing nonlinear medium. The waveguide is uniform along y-axis. To be specific, we consider TEpolarized guided waves, which are governed by the nonlinear Helmholtz equation\n\u0001\n(2)\n\u2206Ey + k02 \u01eb x, |Ey |2 \u03bc (x) Ey = 0,\n\n2\n2\n2\nwhere \u2206 = \u2202 2 /\u2202x\n\u0001 + \u2202 /\u2202z is a two-dimensional Lapla2\ncian, \u01eb x, |Ey | and \u03bc (x) are the dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability, k0 = \u03c9/c is a free-space\nwavenumber, \u03c9 is an angular frequency, and c is the speed\nof light. The guided waves in a similar system, but with\na conventional dielectric core have been studied analytically in Ref.

The fast modes have the phase velocity\nlarger than the phase velocity of light in a homogeneous\nmedium of the core. For such modes, \u03b3 2 < \u01eb2 \u03bc2 , and\ntheir localization is caused by the total internal reflection of light from the cladding, resembling localization\nof waves in a dielectric waveguide. For the slow modes,\n\n\u03b3 2 < \u01eb2 \u03bc2 , and the wave guiding resembles localization\nof the surface waves.\nSolutions of Eq.

The fast modes correspond to k22 > 0, while for the slow modes k22 < 0.\nSolutions (5) at |x| > L have the form of sech-functions\nor solitons which are centered at x = x1 and x = x2 at\neither side of the slab. The modes with x1 < \u2212L and\nx2 > L have the field maxima at the corresponding side\nof the waveguide. From the linear theory, it follows that\nsolutions for the stationary modes can be found separately for the symmetric and antisymmetric modes. As\nhas already been shown [13], even in a symmetric nonlinear dielectric waveguide asymmetric modes can exist.\nTo find the asymmetric waves general solution (5) of the\ndifferential equation (4) should be considered here. Equations for the parameters x1 , x2 of the guided modes can\nbe found from the boundary conditions by eliminating\nthe constants A and B,\nsech(M1 ) [\u03b2 tanh (M1 ) \u2212 tan (k2 L)]\n= 1,\nsech(M2 ) [tan (k2 L) \u2212 \u03b2 tanh (M2 )]\n\u0002\n\u0003\nsech(M1 ) \u03b2 tanh (M1 ) + tan\u22121 (k2 L)\n\u0002\n\u0003 = 1,\nsech(M2 ) tan\u22121 (k2 L) + \u03b2 tanh (M2 )\n\n(6)\n\nwhere M1 = \u03ba1 (L + x1 ), M2 = \u03ba1 (L \u2212 x2 ), and \u03b2 =\n\u03ba1 \u03bc2 /k2 \u03bc1 .

Parameters in the figure are chosen\nin such a way that only one fast mode with a single node\n(close to the point 4) exists in the linear case (at low intensities; for the solution of linear problem and for the\nchoice of parameters see, e.g. Ref. [11]). Thin solid curve\nshows the power of two solitons in a homogeneous nonlinear cladding versus the propagation number. The mode\nstructures are shown in Fig. 2, where each plot demonstrates the transverse wave profile corresponding to the\nnumbered point in Fig. 1.\nThe modes with the parameters close to the dotted\ncurve (points 1, 5, 8 in Fig. 1) resembles two in-phase\nand out-of-phase solitons at either side of the waveguide.\nCloser to the dotted curve the soliton centers in the nonlinear media move further away from the waveguide. The\nsymmetry breaking bifurcation appears on the symmetric mode branch. The asymmetric mode dispersion curve\nin the fast region ends in the symmetric mode branch [see\nFig. 1 (a)], while in the slow wave region the asymmetric mode disappears, when the amplitude of the wave at\none interface becomes the same as the amplitude of the\nsoliton on the other side of the waveguide. Two structures (points 6,7 in Fig. 2) obtained at the same value\nof the propagation constant show the point of the symmetry breaking, where a slight asymmetry can be seen\nin the mode structure shown in the example 7 in Fig. 2.\nSymmetric and asymmetric modes can be both forward\nand backward travelling (p > 0 and p < 0, respectively).\nFor the parameters indicated in Fig. 1, only one fast\nguided mode with a single node exists in the linear limit,\nwhile in the nonlinear regime the modes with zero, one\nand two nodes appear (see Fig. 2). With increasing the\nwaveguide thickness, one more symmetry breaking point\nappears on the antisymmetric mode branch, when the\nslab parameter L exceeds some threshold value. Moreover, more high-order modes can be supported by the\nstructure, and the nonlinear dispersion diagram becomes\nmore complicated.\nNonlinear dispersion shown in Fig. 3(a) is obtained for\nthe parameters when two slow modes exist in the linear\ncase (at low intensities). The transverse structure of the\nmodes, corresponding to the numbered points in Fig. 3(a)\nis shown in Fig. 3(b). For symmetric and antisymmetric\nmodes dispersion curves start from zero energy points\ncorresponding to linear modes in the slow-wave region\nof the plot, and they end at the curve representing the\npower of two solitons when the modes have the structure\nof two in-phase or out-of-phase solitons shifted from the\nwaveguide at either side of it. Nonlinearity can only reduce the propagation constant of these modes (bold solid\nand dotted lines), thus increasing the wave phase veloc-\n\n\f4\nity. These symmetric and antisymmetric modes become\nfast with the growth of the intensity. This becomes possible due to the nonlinear change of the index of refraction\nprofile in the waveguide cladding. This index modification is caused by a high field amplitude in the part of the\ncladding next to the core, as one can see from the plots\n(1,3,4,6) in Fig. 3.\nThe symmetry breaking bifurcation point is located\nat the symmetric mode branch. The asymmetric mode\nbranch ends at the curve corresponding to the power of\none-soliton, when the mode is represented by a soliton\ninfinitely shifted from the waveguide from one side of it\nand a vanishingly small field trapped inside the waveguide (point 9 in Fig. 3). Plots (4,5) in Figs. 3(b) shows\nthe symmetric and asymmetric modes structure for the\nsame value of the propagation constant at the point of\nthe symmetry breaking.\nThe two presented dispersion characteristics of the\nnonlinear waves in a LH waveguide surrounded by a Kerrlike nonlinear medium show the general dispersion prop-\n\nerties of the low-order fast and slow modes, which are\nqualitatively similar in other parameter regions.\nIn conclusion, we have studied nonlinear guided waves\nin a waveguide structure created by a slab of linear LH\nmaterial surrounded by a nonlinear conventional dielectric. We have shown that fast and slow symmetric, asymmetric and antisymmetric modes can exist in this system. On the dispersion diagram, the symmetry breaking occurs for both symmetric and antisymmetric mode\nbranches. In the latter case, there exists a threshold value\nof the slab thickness above which the asymmetric modes\nappear. The guided waves can be both forward and backward travelling. While the direction of the energy flow is\ndetermined by a source, the type of the wave determines\nthe phase velocity direction, i.e. the phase front propagates from the source in the forward waves, and to the\nsource, in the backward waves.\nThe author thanks Yuri S.
