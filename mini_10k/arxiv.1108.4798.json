In particular, quantum theory is incompatible with the assumption of local realism as there are\nentangled quantum states and measurements that lead to violations of a Bell inequality [1]. Consequently, Bell inequalities\nprovide an extremely clear distinction between classical, local hidden variable (LHV), and non-classical (e.g., quantum)\ntheories and so have been studied with great fervor since their\ndiscovery.\nAnother motivation for the study of Bell inequalities has\nbeen from an informational point-of-view. Quantum information has brought new insight into the very nature of quantum\nmechanics and Bell inequalities have been used to gain insight\ninto the information processing power of quantum mechanics.\nBell inequality violations have been used to guarantee the security of quantum key distribution [2], generate randomness\n[3], give an advantage in communication complexity [4] and\nnon-local games [5]. Recently, connections have been made\nbetween quantum computing and a violation of a Bell inequality as giving some computational advantage [6\u20138].\nDespite their utility, there are many open questions about\nBell inequalities. Many breakthroughs have been made by\nconstructing Bell inequalities for many parties each with a\nchoice of two measurements and two measurement outcomes\n[9\u201311]. However, constructing Bell inequalities (that fully define LHV correlations) in general is NP-hard in the number of\nmeasurement choices and measurement outcomes at each site\n[12].\nGeneralizations of the Bell inequality experiment away\nfrom the two measurement setting, two measurement outcome\nscenario have been studied and have led to the discovery of\ninteresting phenomena [13\u201318]. For example, quantum violations can be greater [14] and more robust to experimental\nimperfections [19] in these general scenarios.\nThe Clauser-Horne (CH) inequality [20] also showed that\n\nmeasurement settings\n\ns1\n\ns2\n\nsn\n\ns3\n\n...\n\nspace-like separated measurements\n\nm1\n\nm2\n\nm3\n\nmn\n\nmeasurement outcomes\nsj \u2208 {0, 1, ..., (c \u2212 1)}\n\nmj \u2208 {0, 1, ..., (d \u2212 1)}\n\nFIG. 1: In a single run of a general Bell experiment, n parties each\nmake a measurement from c possible choices, where each measurement has d possible outcomes. Labelling the jth parties' measurement choice and outcome by sj and mj respectively, we can describe\neach run of the experiment with n-digit strings m and s.\n\nthe full probability distribution (including marginal probabilities) can be constrained in LHV theories and violated by quantum mechanics. However, quantum theory does not obtain the\nmaximal violation of the CH inequality possible in theories\nthat do not allow superluminal signaling (non-signaling for\nshort), as demonstrated by Popescu-Rohrlich boxes [21]. As\na result, much work has gone into characterizing the space\nof non-signaling probability distributions [22]. An approach\nbased around convex polytopes has been particularly fruitful but the space of all non-signaling probability distributions\nremains complicated and often counter-intuitive, as demonstrated by the Guess Your Neighbor's Input non-local game\n[23].\n\n\f2\nThe convex polytope of non-signaling probability distributions in the CH inequality setting is well-studied and is an\nexcellent platform for describing quantum correlations via an\ninformation theoretic, or physical principle [24\u201327]. For more\ngeneral settings, it is difficult to describe the space of nonsignaling probabilities. To avoid this difficulty yet still obtain\nsome intuition about the space of non-signaling probabilities,\nwe consider the space of correlators, i.e., the space of probability distributions over joint outcomes.\nFor two-setting, two-outcome Bell inequalities, the correlations studied in Bell experiments can be described in terms\nof stochastic Boolean maps, e.g. probabilistic mixtures of\nBoolean functions from the two bits describing the measurement settings to the parity of the measurement outcomes,\nwhich is a single bit. This approach has proven well-suited to\nthe study of many-body generalizations of the Clauser-HorneShimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality and led to a number of unifications and new insights [6\u20138].\nIn this paper, we generalize this approach by replacing\nstochastic Boolean maps with stochastic maps from the set\nof measurement settings to a single digit representing the parity of the output digits. Our generalization reveals new phenomena which do not occur in the simpler two-setting, twooutcome case.\nHand-in-hand with this \"computational\" description of correlations we shall use a geometric approach. The list of conditional probabilities describing the stochastic map can also\nbe treated as a vector in a real vector space [12, 28, 29]. In\nthis picture, the valid sets of correlations which occur in a theory form a convex region in this space, which, in the case of\nLHV theories, is a polytope. A polytope can be defined as the\nintersection of the half-spaces that satisfy a set of linear inequalities, which, for the LHV polytope, are simply the facet\nBell inequalities.\nVery recently, two of us showed that for 2-setting 2outcome Bell inequalities, computational expressiveness provides an elegant method for studying Measurement-based\nQuantum Computing [7, 8]. We shall show how such approaches can be generalized, and that the switch from Boolean\nto more general maps allows more complex behavior than in\nthe binary case.\nIn Section II, we outline the general framework, fix notation\nand introduce the modular arithmetic which will be employed\nthroughout the paper. In Section III we construct Bell inequalities in this framework. In Section IV we study how methods\nfrom [7] and [8] can be generalized and then summarize in\nSection V.\n\nII.\n\nFRAMEWORK FOR GENERAL CHSH TESTS\n\nThe general scenario we consider is the n-partite Bell experiment shown in Fig. 1, where n > 1. For simplicity, we\nassume all space-like separated parties choose from c possible measurement settings, each with d possible outcomes, so\nwe label an experiment by the variables (n, c, d).\nAs in the standard CHSH experiment, we assume that each\nparty's measurement setting is chosen randomly from a uni-\n\nform distribution and is uncorrelated with the state of the system (see [30\u201333] for some consequences of dropping this assumption).\nWe label the c possible measurements and d possible measurement outcomes by digits sj \u2208 {0, . . . , c \u2212 1} \u2208 Zc and\nmj \u2208 Zd respectively. Therefore the n settings and measurements for each repetition of the experiment are labeled by n\ndigit-strings m \u2208 Znd and s \u2208 Znc corresponding to all n measurement outcomes and all n settings respectively, where x\ndenotes the n-digit string such that the j-th digit is xj .\nTo simplify the analysis we shall assume initially that both\nc and d are prime. We discuss features of the analysis in the\nnon-prime case in appendix B. We will employ arithmetic in\nboth modulo c and modulo d. As we are considering correlators obtained by adding measurement outcomes, the majority of the arithmetic will be modulo d. Therefore we use the\nfollowing convention. In all expressions, arithmetic will be\nmodulo d, except in exceptional cases where the arithmetic is\nmodulo c, which will be denoted with large square brackets\nand subscript c, i.e. [* * * ]c .\nAfter the data m and s has been collected from many repetitions of the experiments, conditional probabilities p(m|s) for\neach value of m and s can be calculated. In the initial CHSH\npaper, and in many-body generalizations, rather than studying this full probability distribution, one merely considers the\nstatistics of the parity of the output m. Here, we shall take a\nsimilar course and study correlators\np(k|s) = p(\n\nn\nX\n\nmj = k|s),\n\n(1)\n\nj=1\n\nPn\nP\nwhere p( j=1 mj = k|s) = m| Pn mj =k p(m|s). When\nj=1\ntaking a sum over mj we are performing addition modulo\nd but when taking sums of probabilities or describing anything that is not related to measurement settings or outcomes\nwe are performing standard, natural arithmetic over the reals. This natural generalization of the CHSH-type correlators in (1) also encompasses the well-known Collins-GisinLinden-Masser-Popescu (CGLMP) inequality for two parties\n[14]. These correlators have a well-defined role when considering the expectation values of joint measurements [35].\nMoreover, singling out this one parameter simplifies the problem by reducing the dimensionality of the problem, whilst still\ncapturing interesting properties of the full distribution p(m|s).\nIn Section II A we introduce the mathematical framework\nfor describing these correlators, which employs a correspondence between conditional probabilities and stochastic maps.\nIn Section II B we apply this framework and derive the full\nfamily of correlators that are possible in LHV theories. Then,\nin Section II C we consider correlators in more general nonsignaling theories and derive generalizations of the PopescuRohrlich non-local box [21].\nA.\n\nCorrelators as Stochastic Maps\n\nBefore we begin our study of correlators, we need to introduce\nsome notation and mathematical construction. The correlators\n\n\f3\np(k|s) are maps from n digit-strings s \u2208 Znc to probability\ndistributions over a single digit k \u2208 Zd . Any stochastic map\nis a convex combination of deterministic processes, which in\nthis case are functions f : Znc \u2192 Zd .\nSuch functions take an \"input\" s \u2208 Znc to a single \"output\"\nk \u2208 Zd . Since Zd and Znc are fields for c, d prime, these functions can be represented as elements of a vector space. There\nare many bases one could choose to represent the function.\nPerhaps the simplest and cleanest basis is the set of Kronecker\ndelta functions \u03b4sy , where y \u2208 Znc , which equals 1 when y = s\nand 0 otherwise. Any function can be represented as\nX\nf (y)\u03b4ys .\n(2)\nf (s) =\ny\u2208Zn\nc\nn\n\nn\n\nThe dc possible coefficients correspond to dc functions. It\nwill sometimes be convenient for the basis set to include the\nconstant function. We shall then replace the delta function \u03b4s0\nwhere 0c is the all-zeros string with the constant function to\nwrite\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nX\nf (s) = \uf8ed\n\u000fy \u03b4ys \uf8f8 + \u03b1,\n(3)\ny\u2208(Zn\nc \u22120c )\n\nwhere \u000fy = (f (y) \u2212 \u03b1) and \u03b1 \u2208 Zd .\nThe natural expression for the computational power of correlators in a general theory is how close they can approximate\nan arbitrary function. Therefore we want to be able to rewrite\n(3) as a polynomial. This can be done as the Kronecker delta\n\u03b4ys can be written as a polynomial (modulo c),\n\u03b4ys =\n\nn\nY\n\n\u03b4ysjj =\n\n=\n\nj=1\n\nc\n\nj=1\n\nj=1\nn\nY\n\nn h\ni\nY\n1 \u2212 (sj \u2212 yj )(c\u22121) ,\n\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f01 \u2212\n\n(c\u22121)\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)l\n\nl=0\n\n\u0012\n\n\uf8f9\n\u0013\nc\u22121\n(yj )l (sj )c\u2212(l+1) \uf8fb .\nl\nc\n\n(4)\nThe first line follows from Fermat's little theorem, as ab\u22121 \u2261\n1 mod b if a is non-zero and b is prime. To reach the second line we have used the binomial theorem which follows\nfrom the distributivity of modular arithmetic. This shows us\nthat any function f (s) can be expressed as a polynomial with\nmixed modular arithmetic systems. Furthermore, when d \u2265 c\nwe can write the function solely in terms of modulo d arithmetic since equation (4) holds for any prime \u2265 c.\nIn this paper, the following class of functions, which we\nterm the \"n-partite linear functions\", will be crucial in the\nstudy of LHV theories.\nDefinition 1. A function f (s) : Znc \u2192 Zd is an n-partite\nlinear function if it can be expressed as\nf (s) =\n\nn\nX\n\ngj (sj ),\n\n(5)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere addition is modulo d and the gj (sj ) are functions\nZc \u2192 Zd of a single variable. If f (s) is not an n-partite linear\nfunction, we refer to it as a non-n-partite linear function.\n\nThese functions will play a role analogous to that of the linear Boolean functions in [7, 8]. The n-partite linear functions\ncan also be written as\nf (s) = \u03b1 +\n\nn (c\u22121)\nX\nX\n\n\u03b2j,a \u03b4asj ,\n\n(6)\n\nj=1 a=1\n\nwith \u03b1, \u03b2j,a \u2208 Zd . There are dn(c\u22121)+1 n-partite linear functions. For c being prime, the key feature of a non-n-partite\nlinear function is the presence of cross-multiplicative terms in\n(4) between different digits sj of s.\nFor non-prime c, we cannot write delta functions in the\nneat polynomial of (4) but in a more elaborate fashion (see\nappendix B) but we can still work in terms of the delta functions for non-prime c. Therefore, the definition of an n-partite\nlinear function in (6) applies for non-prime c. Thus for prime\ns\nand non-prime c, the delta functions \u03b4aj only singularly define\na value of f (s) when there is only one non-zero element in s.\nFor other values of s there is addition modulo d between the\ns\nterms \u03b4aj . Equivalently then, for f (s) to be a non-n-partite\nlinear function, there must be at least one delta function \u03b4ys in\n3 with y being a digit-string with more than one non-zero element. A function f (s) can be written in terms of an n-partite\nlinear part plus a non-n-partite linear part (with addition modulo d), and if the n-partite linear part is zero, then f (s) = 0\nfor all s with only one non-zero element.\nFinally, we note that the above treatment also applies in\na more general setting where instead of setting digit-strings\ns \u2208 Znc we now have digit-strings s \u2208 Zc1 \u00d7 Zc2 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 Zcn =\nL\nn\nj=1 Zcj . That is, the number of possible settings, now labeled cj at each jth site could now be different from other\nsites and also non-prime. The string s is now a direct sum (or\nCartesian product) of the registers Zcj for each site. All delta\nfunctions as defined can be carried over to this general setting. Thus single site maps and n-partite linear functions are\nexactly the same as (6) but for the jth site, c is replaced with\ncj . We now discuss a geometrical picture of the correlators\np(k|s).\nThe correlators p(k|s) are stochastic maps and so must satisfy the positivity inequalities, i.e., the set of cn (d \u2212 1) linear\ninequalities p(k|s) \u2265 0, for all k, s. Furthermore, as some outcome always occurs for any choice of measurement settings s,\nthe\nP correlators must also satisfy the normalization equations,\nk\u2208Zd p(k|s) = 1 for all s. We then only have (d \u2212 1) independent correlators for each value of s, so we omit the correlator p(0|s) and treat the remaining correlators as elements of\na vector in a cn (d \u2212 1)-dimensional real space with elements\nbeing p(k|s) for k 6= 0.\nThe space of correlators satisfying the linear inequalities of\nthe positivity conditions p(k|s)\nP \u2265 0 and normalisation conditions in this reduced space, k6=0 p(k|s) \u2264 1, is then a convex polytope labeled P. It is a convex polytope as it is the\nintersection of the half-spaces defined by these linear inequalities. In any specific theory, the region of allowed correlators, T , will be a convex subregion of P. Equivalently, P can\nbe defined as the convex hull of all deterministic correlators\np(k|s) \u2208 {0, 1}, for all k and s; these deterministic correlators\nare the extreme points of P.\n\n\f4\nIf T has a finite number of extreme points (which is true\nfor LHV theories but not for quantum theory), then T will be\na convex polytope and so can be described as the intersection\nof the half-spaces defined by a set of \"facet-defining\" linear\ninequalities. Facet-defining inequalities are defined in terms\nof affinely independent points, where a set S of K vectors p~i ,\nS = {~\np0 , p~1 , ..., p~(K\u22121) } is affinely independent if for every\np~k \u2208 S, the (K \u2212 1) vectors in the set {~\npi \u2212 p~k |~\npi 6= p~k } are\nlinearly independent [34].\nDefinition 2. A linear inequality is facet-defining for a convex polytope in RD when at least D affinely independent extreme points saturate the inequality (i.e. satisfy the equality of\nthe linear inequality).\nHaving constructed a framework for stochastic maps (and\nequivalently, conditional probabilities) we can immediately\napply this to the correlators studied in this paper. Recall that\nwe will focus our attention on correlators\nrepresentPp(k|s)\nn\ning the probability distribution on k =\nm\n, the sum\nj\nj=1\nmodulo d of the outputs. The correlators have the form of a\nconditional probability and thus a stochastic map, and therefore are characterized by vectors in the space Pn,c,d . The\nspace Pn,c,d represents the set of all correlators possible in\nprinciple, but for certain theories, not all correlators will be\npermitted. The focus of our study is then the regions of correlators which are accessible in LHV theories and in quantum\ntheories. The region of LHV correlators is itself a polytope,\nand the facet-defining inequalities represent the facet-defining\nBell inequalities[10\u201312, 36]. This is the geometrical picture\nof Bell inequalities that we will consider in the next subsection. We now study and characterize the region of correlators\nin LHV theories.\nB.\n\nLocal Hidden Variable Theories\n\nLHV theories are theories in which the measurement outcomes at each site can depend on the input setting of the measurement. The only other parameter the outcome depends on\nis an objective \"hidden variable\" \u03bb \u2208 \u039b which we assume is\nshared by all parties, and where \u039b is the (often continuous)\nset which defines the possible values for this variable. We\ndo not assume that \u03bb is deterministic, but allow it to satisfy\naR probability distribution p(\u03bb)d\u03bb over the space \u039b such that\np(\u03bb)d\u03bb = 1 . Without loss of generality [36], we assume\n\u039b\nthat apart from the probability distribution over \u03bb the internal\nworkings of each measurement device is deterministic. This,\nvia a standard argument, results in conditional probabilities\nfor the set of outputs m of the following form,\nZ\nn\nY\np(m|s) =\nd\u03bbp(\u03bb)\np(mj |sj , \u03bb).\n(7)\n\u039b\n\nj=1\n\nSince \u03bb is the only non-deterministic element to consider, we\ncan study the LHV correlations as the convex combination of\nthe set of possible deterministic maps. We now prove that\nthe map from measurement settings to correlators in any LHV\ntheory is a probabilistic combination of n-partite linear functions.\n\nSchematic Key\nn-partite linear\nfunction\nSemi-linear\nfunction\n\nLHV\n\nNon-n-partite linear\nNon-linear function\nfunction\nTight Bell\nBell inequality\ninequality\nFacet\nNon-trivial Bell inequality\n\nQuantum Region\n\nFIG. 2: Schematic for correlators in LHV theories versus more\ngeneral theories (including quantum mechanical correlators). The\nshapes represent the convex polytopes of general correlators and\nLHV correlators, i.e. the space L. The points on each shape are the\ndeterministic maps corresponding to the particular functions listed.\nWe have shown the region of quantum correlators lying between the\nconvex polytope of n-partite linear functions and the bigger convex polytope of all possible (including non-n-partite linear) maps.\nThe facet Bell inequalities define the region L of LHV correlators\nwhereas the non-trivial Bell inequalities (as mentioned in section III)\njust bound the region. It is preferable but very hard [12] to find facet\nBell inequalities rather than just non-trivial ones.\n\nTheorem 1. In an n-party generalized Bell experiment, with\nc settings and d outputs for each measurement, the region L\nof correlators accessible in a LHV theory is the convex hull of\nthe set of n-partite linear functions.\nProof. The space L of correlators is a convex polytope, we\nonly need to find the extreme points of the polytope, or deterministic correlators, and take their convex hull [36]. This\nmeans we just need to find the deterministic functions possible with LHV correlators. These deterministic functions correspond to adding the measurement outcomes of space-like\nseparated sites, which, for a LHV theory, is deterministic if\nand only if the maps from the measurement setting sj to the\nmeasurement outcome mj at each site is deterministic, i.e., of\nthe form gj (sj ) in Definition 1 for all j. Adding such functions modulo d gives a n-partite linear function.\nThis theorem generalizes the theorem valid for the (n,2,2)\ncase presented by two of us in [8]. It shows that L is compactly characterized by considering it in terms of the computational expressiveness of LHV correlators (see Fig. 2 for a\nschematic of the consequences of Theorem 1). In other words,\nif one considers the Bell experiment as a computation, LHV\ntheories allow the computation of n-partite linear functions\nand nothing more. From this perspective, LHV theories have\nlimited computational power, and thus a theory that allows\ncorrelators outside this region can be perceived as having a\ncomputational advantage in a Bell experiment.\nAs mentioned above, there is a dual description of a convex\npolytope in terms of linear inequalities. The convex polytope\n\n\f5\nof LHV correlators L is the intersection of the half-spaces\ndescribed by the set of facet-defining Bell inequalities (or\nfacet Bell inequalities for short). In Fig. 2 we illustrate the\ndifferent types of Bell inequalities which one can construct,\nand the terminology to classify them. Bell inequalities that\nare equivalent to normalization or positivity conditions (i.e\nthe boundaries of P) are referred to as trivial Bell inequalities. There remain Bell inequalities that are neither necessarily facet-defining or trivial, which we call non-trivial Bell\ninequalities; they are non-trivial because they indicate a separation between the polytopes P and L by bounding the latter.\nIf a correlator is outside L then it must violate one of the\nfacet Bell inequalities. For example, it is well-known that\nsome quantum correlators violate a Bell inequality [1]. Also\nif we observe a violation of a non-trivial inequality then we\nknow that it is outside of L. To recapitulate, for either nontrivial or facet Bell inequalities, we associate a violation with\na computational advantage and in Section III we consider Bell\ninequalities from this computational perspective.\nBefore investigating Bell inequalities, it is worth considering the relation between p(k|s) and p(m|s). Since the latter\nis more general than the former, we are excluding interesting phenomena by only considering correlators. Examples\nof interesting phenomena in the full p(m|s) setting include\nthe I3322 inequality [18] which has interesting implications\nwith regards to quantum correlations; another example is the\nGuess Your Neighbor's Input [23] non-local game which results in some facet Bell inequalities that are not violated by\nany quantum correlators. In spite of these examples, we argue in the next subsection that the correlators p(k|s) capture\nmany important phenomena of full non-signaling probability\ndistributions. In particular, we show that particular deterministic correlators can be uniquely associated with a single nonsignaling distribution, that being a many-body generalization\nof the PR non-local box [21].\n\nC.\n\nNon-signaling theories\n\nIn this section, we shall consider general non-signaling theories. These are theories in which there are no constraints on\ncorrelations other than the no-signaling conditions. First, note\nthat given\nP any deterministic correlator p(k = f (s)|s) where\nk =\nj mj , there exists a non-signaling distribution such\nthat p(mj |sj ) = d1 and the non-signaling distribution results\nin the correlator. This is an immediate consequence of Theorem 2, proven below, but can be understood intuitively since\nevery possible value ofPmj is consistent with one of more output strings m where j mj = f (s). One can then take a\nsuitable mixture of these strings such that every output digit\nis maximally uncertain. Since a maximally uncertain output\ncarries no information about s, the no-signaling condition is\nautomatically satisfied.\nWe denote the space of probability distributions p(m|s) that\nsatisfy the no-signaling conditions by N S n,c,d (the indices\nwill normally be omitted for clarity). This space is a convex\npolytope as it is the intersection of the half-spaces defined by\nthe linear inequalities being the normalization, positivity and\n\nnon-signaling inequalities (see [22] for details). Finding the\nvertices of this polytope is the dual problem of finding the\nfacet-defining linear inequalities corresponding to some vertices (e.g. finding the facet Bell inequalities) which is an NPhard problem. We now discuss some of the vertices of N S\nwithout resorting to this vertex enumeration problem in the\nfollowing discussion.\nA famous example of a non-signaling distribution which\ncannot be simulated by LHV or quantum correlators for two\nspatially separated systems is the PR non-local box. The PR\nbox is defined as a black box that results in measurement outcomes according to the probability distribution,\n(\n1\nif m1 + m2 = s1 s2 ,\np(m1 , m2 |s1 , s2 ) = 2\n(8)\n0 otherwise.\nThe PR box is described by the correlator p(k = s1 s2 |s) = 1.\nIn other words, the PR box is associated with a correlator in\nP2,2,2 . This correlator is a vertex of P2,2,2 corresponding to\nthe deterministic property that the parity of outputs m1 and\nm2 is equal to the product of the inputs s1 and s2 . Furthermore, the PR box is the only distribution in N S 2,2,2 which is\ncompatible with the correlator p(k = s1 s2 |s) = 1. In other\nwords the vertex correlator p(k = s1 s2 |s) = 1 in P uniquely\ndefines a full probability distribution in N S.\nIn this section, we will show that this property is shared by\nmany vertices in P. These vertices are only compatible with a\nsingle probability distribution in N S. In particular, for n = 2,\nevery correlator in P corresponding to a non-n-partite linear\nfunction is only compatible with one probability distribution\nin N S.\nWe emphasize that the full set of vertices of N S for arbitrary c, d and n has never been characterized, and its numerical computation is an NP hard problem (the vertex enumeration problem) [22]. For example, in the (3, 2, 2) setting, the\nspace NS has been shown to have a complicated structure [37].\nTherefore, we are able to capture a large amount of structure\nwithout resorting to optimization.\nBefore we define this structure we need to introduce a new\nclass of functions f (s) : Znc \u2192 Zd that we will only use in\nthis subsection to find a subset of the vertices of N S. We\ncall these functions \"bi-partite linear\" as they correspond to\nfunctions for which, if the observers gather into two groups\nat two space-like separated sites, the measurement outcome\nresults from an n-partite linear function for n = 2.\nDefinition 3. A bipartition, {A, B} of the set of n parties is\na division of the set {1, 2, . . . , n} into two disjoint, non-empty\nsets A and B such that A \u222a B = {1, 2, . . . , n}.\n\nDefinition 4. A function f (s) : Znc \u2192 Zd is bi-partite linear\nif for any bipartition {A, B}, f (s) can be written as\nf (s) = f A (sA ) + f B (sB ),\n\n(9)\n\nwhere sX is the |X|-digit string with entries sX\nj = sXj and\nf X (sX ) is a function on sX .\nWe now show that there exists a unique non-signaling distribution corresponding to a vertex p(k = f (s)|s) of P if and\nonly if f (s) is not bi-partite linear.\n\n\f6\nTheorem 2. For every function f (s), the corresponding vertex p(k = f (s)|s) = 1 of P is compatible with the nonsignaling probability distribution\n(\nPn\nd1\u2212n if j=1 mj = f (s),\n(10)\np(m|s) =\n0\notherwise.\n\nProof. The condition p(k = f (s1 , s2 )|s1 , s2 ) = 1 for\nall s = {s1 , s2 } implies that for every value of m1 in\np(m1 , m2 |s1 , s2 ), there exists a unique value of m2 = f (s) \u2212\nm1 . In computer science terminology we would call this a\n\"unique game\". This immediately implies the equality for the\nfollowing conditional distributions:\n\nFurthermore, this is the only non-signaling distribution compatible with p(k = f (s)|s) = 1 if and only if f (s) is not\nbi-partite linear.\n\np(m1 = x, m2 = f (s) \u2212 x|s) = p(m1 = x|s)\n= p(m2 = f (s) \u2212 x|s),\n(13)\n\nProof. One can verify by inspection that this distribution is\nnon-signaling (since all marginals are maximally uncertain)\nand satisfies p(k = f (s)|s) = 1. It remains to be shown\nthat the distribution in (10) is unique if and only if f (s) is not\nbi-partite linear. To prove the if statement, note that for any\nbi-partite linear function f (s), the non-signaling distribution\n\uf8f1\nP\n2\u2212|A|\u2212|B|\n\uf8f4\n= d2\u2212n if j\u2208A mj = f 1 (sA )\n\uf8f2d\nP\np(m|s) =\nand j\u2208B mj = f 2 (sB ),\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f30\notherwise,\n(11)\nis compatible with p(k = f (s)|s) = 1. We prove the only if\nstatement in Lemma 3.\n\nfor all x \u2208 Zd . The no-signaling condition further implies that\np(m1 = x|s) = p(m1 = x|s1 ) and\n\nNote that local operations, which, for the Bell experiment\nsetting, corresponds to adding functions gj0 (sj ) to the measurement outcomes at each site, do not change whether or not\na function is bi-partite linear. Since every function can be\nwritten in terms of an n-partite linear part and a non-n-partite\nlinear part, local operations can create the n-partite linear part\nand so without loss of generality this part can be set to be zero.\nTherefore it is sufficient to consider functions f (s) such that\nf (t) = 0 for all n-digit strings t \u2208 Znc that have at most one\nnon-zero digit.\nWe can separate the parties using any bipartition A and B\nand treat the sets of parties, A and B, as single parties. To do\nthis, we take the sum modulo d of all outcomes on each side\nof the partition and set the number of settings on each side\nof the partition to be the product of the number of settings\nof\nQ\nthe parties on that side of the partition (e.g., cA = i\u2208A ci ).\nFor a function that is not bi-partite linear, for all bipartitions\ninto A and B, the function f : ZcA \u00d7 ZcB \u2192 Zd is nonn-partite linear for n = 2. Therefore it is sufficient to show\nthat Theorem 2 applies for n = 2 and so it must apply for all\nbipartitions of n parties as long as a function f (s) in (10) is not\nbi-partite linear. If the probability distribution in (10) applies\nfor n = 2 then it must apply for all possible bipartitions of n\nparties thus generating the distribution (10) for all n.\n\n(15)\n\nLemma 3. For every function f (s1 , s2 ) : Zc1 \u00d7 Zc2 \u2192 Zd\nthat is non-n partite linear for n = 2, the only non-signaling\ndistribution compatible with the corresponding vertex p(k =\nf (s1 , s2 )|s) = 1 in P is\n(\nd\u22121 if m1 + m2 = f (s1 , s2 ),\np(m1 , m2 |s1 , s2 ) =\n(12)\n0\notherwise.\n\np(m1 = x|s1 ) = p(m2 = f (s) \u2212 x|s2 ),\n\n(14)\n\nwhich must be satisfied for all s and all x. We will show that\nrepeated application of (14) for varying s allows us to prove\nthat all non-marginal probabilities are equal provided that f (s)\nhas a non-n-partite linear element. As discussed above, we\ncan set f (0, s2 ) = f (s1 , 0) = 0 for all s = {s1 , s2 }. For such\nfunctions, repeatedly applying (14) gives\np(m2 = \u2212x|s2 ) = p(m1\n= p(m2\n= p(m1\n= p(m2\n\n= x|0)\n= \u2212x|0)\n= x|s1 )\n= f (s1 , s2 ) \u2212 x|s2 )\n\nfor all x. Repeated iteration implies\np(m2 = \u2212x|s2 ) = p(m2 = \u03b1f (s1 , s2 ) \u2212 x|s2 )\n\n(16)\n\nfor all \u03b1 \u2208 Zd . The function f (s) is non-n-partite linear so it must have at least one value of {s1 , s2 } where\nf (s1 , s2 ) is non-zero. Since d is prime, \u03b1f (s1 , s2 ) takes\non all values in Zd , therefore the marginals are p(m2 |s2 ) =\nd\u22121 for all m2 , s2 . Applying equation (14) implies that\np(m1 , m2 |s1 , s2 ) = d\u22121 for all m such that m1 + m2 =\nf (s).\nAs we now show, for vertices p(k = f (s)|s) = 1 of P\nsuch that f (s) is bi-partite linear, the existence of multiple\nnon-signaling distributions implies that the vertex of P corresponds to a facet of N S.\nProposition 4. Every non-signaling distribution corresponding to a vertex of P lies on a facet of N S.\nProof. Any non-signaling distribution\nP p(m|s) can be written\nas a convex combination p(m|s)\n= E p(E)pE (m|s) of the\nP\nvertices E of N S, where E p(E) = 1. Therefore the associated correlator is\nPn\nX\nmj\np(k|s) =\np(E)\u03b4k j=1 pE (m|s)\nE\n\n=\n\nX\n\np(E)pE (k|s),\n\n(17)\n\nE\nPn\n\nmj\n\nwhere pE (k|s) = \u03b4k j=1 pE (m|s) is the correlator resulting\nfrom each extreme point of N S.\n\n\f7\nAs the non-signaling distribution results in a correlator that\nis a vertex of P, p(E) = 0 for all vertices of N S that do not\nresult in the same correlator. Denote by E the set of vertices of\nN S that correspond to the correlator and let F be the region\nof convex combinations of the elements of E. Any element in\nF must correspond to the correlator by (17).\nF is not a facet of N S if and only if there exists a convex combination of the vertices not in E that intersects F.\nHowever, if there exists such a convex combination, then this\nwould give a convex combination of correlators in P that is\nequal to a vertex of P, which is a contradiction.\nThe uniqueness of the probability distributions in Theorem\n2 implies that each vertex p(k = f (s)|s) = 1 of P such that\nf (s) is not bi-partite linear corresponds to a unique vertex of\nN S (i.e., the \"facet\" in Proposition 4 collapses to a single\npoint).\nProposition 5. Every probability distribution of the form (10)\nis a vertex of N S if and only if f (s) is not a bi-partite linear\nfunction.\nProof. As there is a unique non-signaling distribution corresponding to the correlator p(f (s)|s) = 1, there is at most one\nE such that p(E) 6= 0 in 17.\nThe structure of the high dimensional space of all possible non-signaling distributions can be partly revealed by considering the space of correlators, which are of relatively low\ndimension. Note that the difficulty in ascertaining the remaining structure of N S comes from the difficulty of finding the\nset of vertices that generate vertices of P that correspond to\nbi-partite linear functions and determining whether this gives\na complete list of vertices. Furthermore, much of the structure of LHV theories in N S is reduced to a small number of\nvertices of P. In this way, the space of correlators efficiently\nencapsulates vital information about all non-signaling probability distributions.\nThere is a connection between the notion of \"true n-party\nnon-locality\" [22, 38] and the vertices of N S defined by Theorem 2. The bi-partite linear functions corresponding to vertices in P only reveal \"non-locality\" (i.e. correlations not resulting from LHV theories) between a subset of all parties, but\nno non-locality across at least one bipartition. However, functions that are not bi-partite linear result in correlations that are\nnon-local across all partitions.\nD.\n\nSummary\n\nIn this section we have constructed a framework for Bell correlators and showed that these correlators capture important\nproperties of the space of non-signaling probability distributions. These correlators also capture the properties of LHV\ntheories in a natural information theoretic description, i.e. that\nof computational expressiveness. This work generalizes previous work of [7, 8] and shows where the structure in these\npreviously studied settings emerges from.\nGiven this framework, we want to look at the correlators\nthat are achievable with quantum theory. It is well-known\n\nn\n2\n2\n2\n3\n3\n2\n\nc\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n3\n\nd # Vertices # Facet Bell inequalities\n2\n8\n16\n3\n27\n66\n5\n125\n1020\n2\n16\n256\n3\n81\n125,412\n2\n32\n90\n\nTABLE I: A table of number of facet Bell inequalities for each setting\n(n, c, d) and the number of vertices for the LHV polytope.\n\nthat there exists quantum mechanical correlators that cannot\nbe described by correlators resulting from an LHV theory, and\nthis is demonstrated by the violation of a Bell inequality [1].\nTherefore we now devote our attention to the Bell inequalities.\n\nIII.\n\nBELL INEQUALITIES\n\nBell inequalities allow us to characterize the polytope of LHV\ncorrelators. The normalization and positivity inequalities defined in Section II B define part of L, the LHV polytope. However, these inequalities are also satisfied by all possible correlators p(k|s) and define the polytope P of all correlators.\nThese inequalities then trivially bound L as we cannot show\na separation between P and L. We want to demonstrate such\na separation and non-trivially bound P, which we can do by\nconstructing Bell inequalities of the form\nX\n\u03c9k,s p(k|s) \u2264 \u03b3L ,\n(18)\ns,k\n\nfor all p(k|s) \u2208 L, where \u03c9k,s and \u03b3L are real numbers. We\ncall \u03b3P the maximum value of the sum on the left-hand-side\nover correlators in P. For the Bell inequality to be non-trivial,\nwe require \u03b3L < \u03b3P .\nIf a correlator exists outside the LHV polytope, then it violates at least one facet Bell inequality. Finding facet Bell\ninequalities involves an optimization of the parameters \u03c9k,s\nin (18) and in general is an NP-hard problem [12]. The problem is a facet enumeration problem and there are algorithmic\npackages that can perform this optimization such as Polymake\n[39]. These optimization algorithms are often used to characterize the non-signaling [22] and LHV polytopes [18] in full\nprobability distribution settings. We used Polymake to find\nthe facet Bell inequalities for a number of small (n, c, d) settings. The number of facet Bell inequalities for each setting is\nlisted in Tab. I, which shows that the number of inequalities\ngrows rapidly in the size of the problem.\nFor the case of (n, 2, 2), the LHV polytope is a hyperoctahedron [10, 11]. In general though, there is no obvious geometrical structure or connection between the numbers of vertices and the numbers of facet inequalities. It is quite apparent\nthat finding the facet Bell inequalities is no easy task.\nIn this section we will use the computational insight gained\nin Section II to construct Bell inequalities. We first find a\n\n\f8\nsimple way to generate non-trivial Bell inequalities that necessarily bound the LHV polytope. As we shall discuss further\nin Section IV, these non-trivial inequalities also have a nice\ncross-over with the structures in so-called non-local games.\nWe then describe some of the facet Bell inequalities and show\nthat they too have a computational nature.\nFinally, in the last part of this section, we discuss the quantum violation of facet Bell inequalities. We show that there\nis a violation for all facet Bell inequalities for n = 2 in Tab.\nI. We comment on the quantum states that maximally violate\nthese Bell inequalities and find that in few instances is it a\nmaximally entangled state. This supports the view that entanglement and a violation of a Bell inequality are not synonymous concepts.\n\nP\n\ng(s ,s )\n\n\u03b4s1 s12 2 \u2264 3 as the functions g(s1 , s2 ) overlaps with\nthe function s1 s2 for at most 3 values of s. An example of\na linear function achieving this overlap is g(s1 , s2 ) = 0. On\nthe other hand, if a correlator p(k = f (s)|s1 , s2 ) achieves the\nmap f (s) = s1 s2 deterministically, then it achieves a value\nof \u03b3P = 4 for the sum in (19). This inequality highlights the\ninability for LHV correlators to evaluate non-linear Boolean\nfunctions deterministically.\nFor all settings (n, c, d), we can generalize the above concepts from the Boolean algebra for (2, 2, 2) to our more general framework of maps f : Znc \u2192 Zd . We construct nontrivial Bell inequalities in the following way:\ns1 ,s2\n\nd\u22121\nXX\ns\n\nA.\n\nk=0\n\n\u03b4fk(s) p(k|s) \u2264 sup\ng(s)\n\nX\n\nf (s)\n\n\u03b4g(s) ,\n\n(20)\n\ns\n\nNon-trivial Bell inequalities\n\nOne might ask what is the point of looking for Bell inequalities that are not facet-defining? Firstly, bounding the set of\nLHV correlators still creates a non-trivial subregion of a correlator space. Secondly, we can still demonstrate non-classical\nbehavior without the computational difficulty that the facetdefining condition creates. Finally, despite not being facetdefining, non-trivial Bell inequalities can have a role in particular applications such as in non-local games or Measurementbased Quantum Computing (MBQC) [8], as non-trivial Bell\ninequalities might capture computational power. We will elaborate on this final point in Section IV.\nIn this subsection, we will discuss non-trivial Bell inequalities as being inequalities in the space P 0 of all possible correlators p(k|s), including those for kP= 0. In this space, the\nnormalisation conditions become k p(k|s) = 1 for all s,\nn\nwhich defines a bounded hyperplane in Rdc . The space of\n0\ncorrelators P is a convex polytope defined by the positivity\nconditions within this hyperplane. We regard the region of\nLHV correlators, L, as a sub-region in both P and P 0 as one\ncan always go between the two spaces by disregarding p(0|s)\nand applying the normalisation inequalities. In the rest of the\npaper, including the discussion on facet Bell inequalities, we\nalways discuss correlators in the space P.\nGiven the motivation for finding non-trivial Bell inequalities we now present a simple way of generating non-trivial\nBell inequalities. We begin by considering the CHSH inequality [9] as an example. The CHSH inequality can be written as\n1\nXX\ns1 ,s2 k=0\n\n\u03b4sk1 s2 p(k|s1 , s2 ) \u2264 3,\n\n(19)\n\nwhich is (18) with \u03b3L = 3 and \u03c9k,s = \u03b4sk1 s2 . The CHSH\ninequality is also a facet Bell inequality for this setting.\nBy convexity, it is only necessary to consider the vertices of the LHV polytope to obtain the bound \u03b3L = 3. In\nthis case, the vertices correspond to the linear boolean functions of s1 and s2 [7]. For these vertices the correlators\nk\nare then p(k|s1 , s2 ) = \u03b4g(s\nwhere g(s1 , s2 ) are the lin1 ,s2 )\near Boolean functions on {s1 , s2 }. The sum in (19) is then\n\nwhere the supremum is over the set of n-partite linear functions and f (s)\nis a non-n-partite function of s. Therefore there\nn\nare N = dc \u2212 dn(c\u22121)+1 non-trivial Bell inequalities of the\nform (20).\nWe can prove the inequality in (20) using the same arguments as with the CHSH inequality. By convexity we\nonly need to consider the vertices of L which correspond to\nthe n-partite linear functions g(s). The sum in (20) is then\nP Pd\u22121 k k\ns\nk=0 \u03b4f (s) \u03b4g(s) . We then take the supremum over all npartite functions g(s) to obtain the right-hand-side of (20).\nWhilst these inequalities might seem contrived, they include some interesting Bell inequalities. For example, the\nSvetlichny inequality [38] for three parties takes the form of\n(20), i.e.,\nX\ns1 ,s2 ,s3\n\n\u03b4sk1 (s2 +s3 )+s2 s3 p(k|s1 , s2 , s3 ) \u2264 6,\n\n(21)\n\nwhich is (20) for f (s) = s1 (s2 +s3 )+s2 s3 . The Svetlichny inequality is not a facet Bell inequality for the LHV polytope L\nin the (3, 2, 2) setting [10] but it still captures very interesting\nphenomena. In particular, the Svetlichny inequality captures\ncorrelations that are consistent with LHV theories if one averages over the measurement settings and outcomes for any one\nof the parties.\nThe non-trivial Bell inequalities (20) can be seen to truly\ncapture the inability of LHV theories to evaluate non-n-partite\nlinear functions via correlators. A way of emphasizing this is\nto consider these inequalities as a \"non-local game\" [5]. That\nis, given an input s to n parties that do not communicate, what\nis the maximum\nPnprobability of the parties producing outcomes\nm such that j=1 mj = f (s) for some function f (s) using\ndifferent strategies (or resources such as shared randomness or\nentanglement). A referee chooses\nPnthe input and then obtains\nall outputs m before computing j=1 mj .\nIf the referee's choice of input is uniformly random, then\nthe inequality in (20) captures the mean success probability of\nan LHV strategy performing the function f (s); one just needs\nto divide both sides by cn to obtain a proper probability. If one\nimagines that the choice of input s is not chosen atP\nrandom but\ninstead with some probability p(s) \u2265 0 such that s p(s) = 1\n\n\f9\nthen we can modify (20) to be:\nX\ns\n\np(s)\n\nd\u22121\nX\nk=0\n\n\u03b4fk(s) p(k|s) \u2264 sup\ng(s)\n\nX\n\nf (s)\n\np(s)\u03b4g(s) ,\n\n(22)\n\ns\n\nto get the mean success probability of performing the function\nf (s) with LHV correlators given a distribution p(s) on inputs.\nWe now present the following proposition that shows an\ninfinite class of non-trivial Bell inequalities can be easily\ngenerated.\nProposition 6. Any Bell inequality of the form (22) is nontrivial whenever p(s) 6= 0 for all s.\nProof. For any n-partite linear function,\nX\nX\nf (s)\np(s)\u03b4g(s) <\np(s) = 1\n\nn\n2\n2\n2\n3\n3\n2\n\nc\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n3\n\nd # Symmetry classes\n2\n1\n3\n1\n5\n4\n2\n4\n3\n62\n2\n1\n\nTABLE II: The number of symmetry classes for each setting\n(n, c, d). We have excluded the symmetry class of all positivity and\nnormalisation inequalities from this number.\n\n(23)\n\n1. permutations of parties - {si , sj , ..., sn }\n\u2192\n{si0 , sj 0 , ..., sn0 } where k 0 = \u03c3(k) is an element\nof the permutation group of order n\n\nas there must be a value of s such that \u03b4g(s) = 0. Therefore the\nright-hand-side of (22) is strictly less than 1 for all correlators\nin L. However, for the correlator p(k = f (s)|s) = 1 in P, the\nleft-hand side of (22) is exactly 1.\n\n2. relabeling of measurement settings - sj \u2192 sj + \u03b1j for\nsome \u03b1j \u2208 Zc\n\ns\n\ns\nf (s)\n\nThe beauty of these non-trivial Bell inequalities is that they\nare easily generated as one can easily describe the n-partite\nlinear functions for any setting (n, c, d), yet they still bound\nthe region of LHV correlators. They also explicitly capture\nthe computational aspect of a Bell inequality experiment: the\nvalue of the left hand side of (22) gives the mean success probability of performing a particular function.\nWe now consider the facet Bell inequalities that completely\ncharacterize the LHV polytope for small values of (n, c, d).\nWhilst these latter inequalities do not have the immediacy of\nthe non-trivial Bell inequalities and are difficult to calculate,\nthey are still the optimal tool for demonstrating non-classical\ncorrelations.\nB.\n\nFacet Bell inequalities\n\nThe facet Bell inequalities satisfy the facet-defining condition\nfor LHV correlators and so if a correlator is outside the region\nof LHV correlators it must necessarily violate one of the facet\nBell inequalities. In Tab. I we listed the number of facet Bell\ninequalities for a few settings that could be computed using\nthe software Polymake. Included in the number of facet Bell\ninequalities are the cn normalization and (d \u2212 1)cn positivity\ninequalities that define the polytope P. Despite these dcn inequalities, there are still a significant number of inequalities\nremaining. Also note we are again discussing correlators in\nthe space P of all correlators except p(0|s) and L is the subregion of LHV correlators in this space.\nWe can reduce the number of facet Bell inequalities by considering relabelings of the measurement choices, outcomes\nand parties, which we refer to as symmetries. If a Bell inequality can be changed into another inequality by such an\noperation, we refer to them as equivalent, or as members of\nthe same symmetry class. Explicitly, the symmetries are\n\n3. relabeling of measurement outcomes - mj \u2192 mj +\n\u03b2(sj , j) where \u03b2(sj , j) \u2208 Zd .\nThe n-partite linear functions are closed under all of these operations. Using the facet-defining condition, the vertices of\nL that saturate a facet Bell inequality must be equivalent to\nanother set of vertices in L by these operations that saturate\nanother facet Bell inequality. Hence we can group together\nthe facet Bell inequalities into these symmetry classes.\nThere are n! permutations of n parties and cn ways of relabeling measurement settings. Since for P\neach input sj we add\nn\na value \u03b2(sj ), for each input s, \u03b2(s) = j=1 \u03b2(sj ) is added\nPn\nto j=1 mj . There will be at most dcn values of \u03b2(s).\nWe constructed a search algorithm to find all the symmetry classes of facet Bell inequalities for each setting (n, c, d).\nIn Tab. II we list the number of symmetry classes for each\nof the settings in Tab. I, which is dramatically fewer than the\ntotal number of facet Bell inequalities. One of the symmetry\nclasses for each setting is the class of normalization and positivity conditions, leaving all the facet Bell inequalities that\ncan be violated by LHV correlators outside of L. We have\ntherefore omitted the class of these positivity and normalization inequalities from Tab. II in order to leave the inequalities\nthat can be violated.\nWe now look at a few particular families of facet Bell inequalities for the bipartite and tripartite setting based on the\nCGLMP inequality. We briefly discuss the (2, 3, 2) setting\nand show how the CHSH inequality is essentially the only relevant facet inequality for this setting.\nBipartite Two-Setting Facet Bell Inequalities - A symmetry\nclass of note for n = c = 2 is the class of facet Bell inequalities that are equivalent to the CGLMP inequality [14]. We\ncan rewrite this inequality after symmetry transformations and\n\n\f10\nmapping it into our normalized probability space P to obtain,\n\nthe symmetry class of the inequality\n\n2\nX\nCCGLM P = d \u00d7 p(\nmj = 1|0, 0)\u2212\n\nX\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)s1 +s2\n\ns\n\n2\nX\n(\u22121)s1 +s2 p(\nmj = 1|s)+\n\ns\n\nj=1\n\nd\u22121\nX\n\n2\nX\n(d \u2212 k \u2212 1)p(\nmj = k|s) \u2264 d.\n\nk=2\n\nj=1\n\n(24)\nThis inequality is also equivalent to the CHSH inequality for\nd = 2 which we now write in the space P for clarity:\nCd=2 =\n\nX\ns\n\n(\u22121)s1 s2 p(\n\n2\nX\nj=1\n\nmj = 1|s) \u2264 2.\n\n(25)\n\nFor all possible correlators in P, the maximal value of the\nleft-hand-side of the CGLMP inequality is 2d \u2212 1, thus violating it. In fact, for all d, this maximal violation of the\nCGLMP is obtained by a vertex of P corresponding to the\nmap f (s) = s1 s2 + 1, i.e. the correlator p(k|s) = \u03b4sk1 s2 +1 .\nMasanes has shown that the only non-trivial, facet Bell inequalities are those that are equivalent to the CGLMP for the\n(2, 2, 3) setting [40]; this is confirmed by Tab. II.\nFor the (2, 2, 2) setting there are 24 \u2212 23 = 8 non-n-partite\nlinear functions and also 8 inequalities in the symmetry class\nof the CHSH inequality. This is no coincidence as every Bell\ninequality in the symmetry class in maximally violated by a\nvertex of P corresponding to a non-n-partite linear function.\nThis also occurs for the (2, 2, 3) setting, there are 34 \u221233 = 54\nnon-n-partite linear functions and 54 inequalities in the symmetry class of the CGLMP inequality. It can also be checked\nthat every inequality in this symmetry class is violated by a\ndifferent non-n-partite linear function.\nThe correspondence between non-n-partite linear functions\nand facet Bell inequality echoes the non-trivial Bell inequalities described by the inequalities of the form (20). There is\na computational aspect to each inequality as a violation indicates that a correlator is in some sense closer to the non-npartite linear functions. However, the correspondence breaks\ndown for the (2, 2, 5) setting where there are 54 \u2212 53 = 500\nnon-n-partite linear functions but 1000 non-trivial, facet Bell\ninequalities in total. In this instance, each vertex of P maximally violates two facet Bell inequalities (each belonging to\ndifferent symmetry classes). Therefore there are 1000 facet\nBell inequalities (see Appendix A for more details).\nTripartite Facet Bell Inequalities - We have given an indication that facet Bell inequalities for n = c = 2 have a computational interpretation. Every facet Bell inequality we have\nfound is maximally violated uniquely by a vertex of P. In\nthis sense the violation of a facet Bell inequalities can quantify how computationally powerful a theory is. For situations\nwith n > 2, this becomes more complicated even for n = 3\nand c = d = 2. The Mermin inequality [41] for example is in\n\n3\nX\nj=1\n\ns\n\nj=1\n\nX\n\n\u03b4ss21 (\u22121)s1 s3 p(\n\nmj = 1|s) \u2264 2.\n\n(26)\n\nTwo vertices of P that are not vertices of L maximally violate\nthis inequality. The two maps that correspond to these vertices\nare f (s) = s1 s2 s3 + 1 and f (s) = s1 s3 + 1. Therefore\nthere is no longer a one-to-one correspondence between facet\ninequalities and the vertices of P that violate the inequality.\nThe CHSH inequality expressed in terms of the expectation\nvalue of measurements (see next subsection) for two parties\ncan be used to build facet Bell inequalities for more parties\n[10] such as the above inequality (26). Analogously, we define\nCGLMP for three parties using the two party inequality. We\nhave three parties but now we only consider non-zero terms in\na Bell inequality when the third party's measurement setting\ns3 = 0. For LHV correlators p(k|s1 , s2 , 0) the n-partite linear\nfunctions that can be achieved are f (s) = [\u03b11 s1 +\u03b12 s2 +\u03b13 ]3\nwith \u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b13 \u2208 Zd : the n-partite linear functions on two\nvariables s1 and s2 . Since the CGLMP inequality is facetdefining for the region of LHV correlators for two parties, or\nvariables s1 and s2 , it is facet-defining for this space of the\nn = 3 correlators for s3 = 0. Then we can write the tripartite\nCGLMP inequality as\n3\nX\n0\nCCGLM P = d \u00d7 p(\nmj = 1|0, 0, 0)\u2212\nj=1\n\n3\nX\n\nX\n(\u22121)s1 +s2 p(\n\nmj = 1|s1 , s2 , 0)+\n\nj=1\n\ns\n\n3\nd\u22121\nX\nX\nX\nmj = k|s1 , s2 , 0) \u2264 d.\n(d \u2212 k \u2212 1)p(\n(\u22121)s1 +s2\ns\n\nj=1\n\nk=2\n\n(27)\nFor the case of (3, 2, 3), this tripartite CGLMP inequality is\nfacet-defining and forms a symmetry class with 324 inequali0\nties. This is also true for d = 2 where CCGLM\nP results from\nthe CHSH inequality and forms one of 4 non-trivial symmetry classes. Also in this case there is another way of substituting the CHSH inequality to obtain the class containing the\ninequality (26). This class also generalizes to the d = 3 setting so that the following inequality is against the space where\n0\ns1 = s2 in a similar fashion to CCGLM P :\n00\n\nCCGLM P\nX\n\n3\nX\n= d \u00d7 p(\nmj = 1|0, 0, 0)\u2212\nj=1\n\n\u03b4ss21 (\u22121)s1 +s3 p(\n\ns\n\n\u03b4ss21 (\u22121)s1 +s3\n\nmj = 1|s)+\n\nj=1\n\ns\n\nX\n\n3\nX\n\nd\u22121\nX\n\n(d \u2212 k \u2212 1)p(\n\nk=2\n\n3\nX\nj=1\n\nmj = k|s) \u2264 d.\n(28)\n\n\f11\nThis inequality also forms a symmetry class with 324 inequalities. There are 60 other symmetry classes for (3, 2, 3) (excluding the class of positivity and normalization inequalities).\nInequalities from each of these classes can be found in the\nsupplementary material [42].\nBipartite Three-Setting, Two-Outcome Facet Inequalities Finally, as can be seen from Tab. II for the (2, 3, 2) setting\nthere is only one symmetry class of non-trivial facet Bell inequalities. The Bell inequality generating this symmetry class\nis a generalization of the CHSH inequality:\n\n[15, 35], which, for the above projective measurements, are\nE(s) = tr(\u03c1\n\nn\nO\n\nMsj )\n\nj=1\n\n=\n\nX\n\ne\n\ni2\u03c0\nd (\n\nPn\n\nj=1\n\nmj )\n\nm\n\n=\n\ntr(\u03c1\n\nn\nO\nj=1\n\nd\u22121\nX\n\ne\n\ni2\u03c0k\nd\n\n|mj isj hmj |sj )\n\npQ (k|s).\n\n(31)\n\nk=0\n\nCc=3 =\n\n2\n2\nX\nY\nX\ns\ns\n(\u22121)s1 s2\n(\u03b40j + \u03b41j )p(\nmj = 1|s) \u2264 2.\nj=1\n\ns\n\nj=1\n\n(29)\nThis is exactly the same as the CHSH inequality if instead of\nc = 3 we had c = 2. In fact for either c or d equal to 4 and\nn = 2, inequalities constructed from the CHSH inequality\ncapture a lot of the structure of the LHV polytope.\nIn this subsection we have given an indication of the richness of the structure of the LHV polytope for some simple\nsettings. There is also a computational element to some of\nthese Bell inequalities, such as the CGLMP inequality which\nis maximally violated by a vertex of P, in that greater violations enable correlators to come closer to evaluating a non-npartite linear function deterministically. Quantum correlators\nare known to provide violations of Bell inequalities and so in\nthe next section we discuss quantum correlators.\n\nThe correlators pQ (k|s) in (31) can be replaced with LHV\ncorrelators to obtain the expectation value of measurements\nfor LHV theories.\nOur construction of correlators therefore has a natural role\nin the construction of expectation values E(s). If we have a\nBell inequality in terms of correlators such as (18), it is possible to relate it to a Bell inequality in terms of these expectation\nvalues by taking the discrete Fourier transform [35]. The discrete Fourier transform of (18) gives\nd\u22121\nXX\ns\n\n\u03bc=0\n\n\u03b7\u03bc,s [E(s)]\u03bc \u2264 \u03b3L\n\n(32)\n\nwith \u03b3L as defined in (18) if the complex pre-factors \u03b7\u03bc,s are\nd\u22122\n\n\u03b7\u03bc,s =\n\n\u03bck\n1X\n\u03c9k,s e\u2212i2\u03c0 d .\nd\n\n(33)\n\nk=1\n\nC.\n\nQuantum correlators\n\nQuantum correlations can violate all manner of Bell inequalities if the correlations are generated from measurements on an\nentangled state. However, the connection between a violation\nof a facet Bell inequality and entanglement is not completely\nclear. Recently the two concepts have become very distinct\nand nowhere is this best demonstrated by the CGLMP inequality where the greatest violation of the CGLMP inequality is not achieved with a bipartite maximally entangled state.\nThe region Q \u2282 P of quantum correlators is convex, but it\nis not a polytope since there are an infinite number extreme\npoints [12]. It is not clear in general how to define all of the\nextreme points of Q. We now discuss this region in the context\nof our CGLMP-like Bell tests.\nWithout loss of generality, we can assume that the measurements at each site are projective measurements by Naimark's\ntheorem [43], so that for a quantum state \u03c1 \u2208 (H)\u2297n , the\ncorrelators are\npQ (k|s) =\n\nX\nm\n\nPn\n\n\u03b4k\n\nj=1\n\nmj\n\ntr(\u03c1\n\nn\nO\nj=1\n\n|mj isj hmj |sj ).\n\n(30)\n\nAs \u03c1 can be expressed as a convex combination of pure states,\nwe can, for the purposes of finding the maximum quantum\nviolation, assume that \u03c1 is a pure state.\nA more compact way of expressing Bell inequalities is in\nterms of the expectation values of joint measurements Msj\n\nThis construction is another motivation for considering correlators as opposed to the full distribution p(m|s).\nTo obtain the maximal violation of a Bell inequality by\nquantum correlators, we optimize (32) over pure states \u03c1 and\nunitary operators Msj (which correspond to projective measurements). For the case of (n, 2, 2), all facet Bell inequalities are maximally violated by the GHZ state |GHZi =\n\u221a1 (|0i\u2297n + |1i\u2297n ) [10]. In general, finding the maximal vi2\nolation is a difficult problem, however, there are methods of\nproviding numerical lower and upper bounds on this quantum\nviolation (see e.g. [45] and [15]). We will now discuss and\nutilize these methods to find the maximal quantum violations\nof facet Bell inequalities for two parties.\nFirst we discuss methods of finding a lower bound on a\ntwo-party maximal quantum violation used in [15] and [46].\nThe quantum state is first fixed as the d2 -dimensional maxPd\u22121\nimally entangled state |\u03a8i = \u221a1d j=0 |jji and we optimize over the unitaries Msj . More specifically we write\nthe projectors as |mj isj hmj |sj = Msj |kihk|Ms\u2020j , where\n{|ki|k \u2208 Zd } is the standard basis of HD . The Msj\ncan be written as Msj = F Dsj where F is the d-byd Hadamard, or Quantum Fourier Transform matrix and\nDsj = diag(ei\u03c61 (sj ) , ei\u03c62 (sj ) , ..., ei\u03c6d (sj ) ), a diagonal matrix\nwith \u03c6j (sj ) as real phases. Therefore we optimise over these\nphases \u03c6j (sj ) to numerically maximize the quantum violation\nfor the maximally entangled state.\nOnce we find the optimal phases \u03c6j (sj ) for each sj , we optimize over the pure states, \u03c1, by finding the largest eigenvalue\n\n\f12\nn\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\nc\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n3\n\nd Symmetry class LHV bound Quantum bound\n2\nCd=2\n2\n2.4142\u2020\n3\nCCGLM P\n3\n3.9149\n5\nI1\n5\n6.3145\n5\nI2\n5\n7.6290\n5\nI3\n5\n7.0314\n5\nCCGLM P\n5\n7.0314\n2\nCc=3\n2\n2.4142\u2020\n\nTABLE III: We list the bipartite maximal quantum violations for particular facet Bell inequalities for c and d. The inequalities I1 , I2 and\nI3 can be found in the appendix A. Those violations that are achieved\nwith the bipartite maximally entangled state of d2 dimension are labeled with a \u2020.\n\nof the operators corresponding to (32). The largest eigenvalue\nthen corresponds to the eigenvector |\u03c8i. Using this method\nit has been shown that the maximal violation of the CGLMP\ninequality is achieved with a state that is not maximally entangled [46].\nOne method of providing an upper bound to the violation of\na Bell inequality is the use of semi-definite programming [45].\nA Gram matrix is constructed from the expectation value of\nproducts (or sequences) of projectors and this matrix is positive semi-definite. The Bell inequality is then a linear objective function on this matrix subject to linear constraints on\nelements of the Gram matrix. Navascues et al constructed a\nhierarchy of semi-definite programs that converge to the set of\nquantum correlations and also constructed a method for testing for convergence [45].\nWe used YALMIP and SeDuMi [47] to implement these\nsemi-definite algorithms to find the upper bound to quantum\nviolations whilst finding lower bounds using previously described methods. In Tab. III, we list the maximal quantum\nviolations of the facet Bell inequalities in symmetry classes\ndescribed previously; a single value is listed as the upper and\nlower bounds coincide differ by at most 10\u22129 , which is consistent with numerical error. Interestingly, of the settings studied,\nonly Bell inequalities for qubits are maximally violated by a\nmaximally entangled bipartite state.\n\nD.\n\nSummary\n\nDual to a vertex description of a convex polytope is the facet\ndescription where facets are defined by linear inequalities. We\nhave given an insight into some of the complicated structure\nbehind these facet Bell inequalities. Despite the complicated\nstructure, there is a computational insight into the facet Bell\ninequalities for particular settings. The CGLMP inequalities\nare computational in nature and can be used to construct facet\nBell inequalities for multipartite scenarios. We then showed\nthat these and other bipartite facet Bell inequalities are violated by quantum correlators, which indicates that quantum\nmechanics offers a computational advantage relative to any\nLHV theory.\n\nThe non-trivial Bell inequalities that we have constructed in\nthis section have an explicit computational meaning. We will\nexplore these inequalities in the context of non-local games\nand Measurement-based Quantum Computing. More generally we consider how much of the structures developed in\nthis paper can be applied to these information processing scenarios. Whilst a lot of ideas have been generalized from the\n(n, 2, 2) setting, we show that LHV correlators are more powerful when c, d > 2.\n\nIV.\n\nBELL TESTS, NON-LOCAL GAMES AND QUANTUM\nCOMPUTING\n\nConnections have been made between Bell tests and\nMeasurement-based Quantum Computing (MBQC) [6, 8].\nThis connection has been explicitly explored in the setting\nwhere each party has a choice of two measurements, each with\ntwo outcomes. Furthermore, the role of post-selection in Bell\ntests simulating MBQC has been explored in this setting [7]\nleading to novel quantum phenomena. In this section we will\ngive an overview of all of these connections and then discuss\ntheir implementation in general (n, c, d) settings. So much of\nthe computational insight in constructing LHV correlators in\nthe (n, 2, 2) setting carries over into the (n, c, d) setting, but\nthe structure of LHV correlators is also richer. This richness\nalso means certain results do not generalize.\nWe have already discussed non-local games in the context\nof the non-trivial Bell inequalities in section III. There is an\noverlap between non-local games and MBQC if we consider\nthe elements in both information processing scenarios. Firstly\nin MBQC there are a number of sites that share a particular resource (e.g. the cluster state [48] for quantum computing), and\nsingle-site measurements are made on this resource. All measurement data is processed by a classical computer and in order to achieve a universal quantum computer in current models, adaptive measurements are required; adaptivity means\nchoices of measurements are informed by previous measurement outcomes. In the model developed by Raussendorf and\nBriegel, the classical computer only needs to be able to perform linear Boolean functions to achieve a universal quantum\ncomputer [48].\nWe now recall the model of non-local games as discussed\nearlier [5]. There are a number of parties who share some resource state but do not communicate with each other. These\nparties receive an input from a referee and send an output\nback. The referee processes the outputs to see if the parties successfully performed some task. MBQC can be recast\nas a non-local game where the parties choose their measurement based upon the input they receive and send the referee\nthe measurement outcome. The referee in MBQC is a classical computer who processes the measurement data in order\nto achieve some task. Therefore the referee performs linear\nBoolean function computation on the measurement data described by bits [8].\nMBQC has been generalized to include more than a choice\nof two measurements and two measurement outcomes at each\nsite [49], thus measurement data is no longer encoded in bits.\n\n\f13\nThe classical computer processing measurement data in these\nmodels just uses addition modulo d where d is the number\nof measurement outcomes at each site [49]. Addition modulo\nd on data is still an extremely limited form of computation,\neven compared to the n-partite linear functions discussed in\nthis paper.\nFor simplicity we say that the data sent and received from\nthe measurements sites is encoded as digits in Zd . The specific model of MBQC as a non-local game that we consider\nconsists of three stages:\n|x|\n\n1. A digit-string x \u2208 Zd of length |x| is processed by a\nclassical computer, which then sends a single digit to\neach site after processing;\n2. At each site, this digit is used to select a measurement\nand the outcome is sent to the classical computer;\n3. The classical computer processes this measurement\ndata to output a single digit.\nThe processing power of the classical computer is limited to\naddition modulo d.\nThe input at each site sj = h(x) is now a result of some\npre-processing leading to a function h(x) on the digit-string x\nwhere |x| \u2264 n. This function is limited to addition modulo\nP|x|\nd on x, i.e. h(x) =\nj=1 \u03b1j xj where \u03b1j \u2208 Zd . Then the\nprocessing\non\nmeasurement\noutcomes mj leads to the output\nPn\nfunction j=1 mj without loss of generality.\nThe non-trivial Bell inequalities described in this paper capture the mean success probability of LHV correlators evaluating a non-n-partite linear function f (s) for the input s. We\nnow investigate how the construction of Bell inequalities is\nmodified by this new element of pre-processing on a digitstring x. The pre-processing allows us to express the correlators as being conditioned upon x, i.e., p(k|x) := p(k|s(x)).\nThe correlators p(k|x) are now elements of a vector p~ in\n|x|\nR(d\u22121)d . We now describe the structure of the region of all\npossible correlators.\nFor the digit-string x if we set n = |x| and sj = xj for all\nj, then the possible correlators p(k|x) live in the space P for\nthis setting. If we increase n and consider other forms of linear pre-processing, we allow more freedom to evaluate more\ncomplicated functions. As shown in [8] for the pre-processing\ndescribed above, quantum correlators for d = 2 = c benefit from this freedom. That is, for d = 2 = c settings,\nall deterministic correlators p(k|x) corresponding to functions\n|x|\nf (x) : Zd \u2192 Zd can be achieved for some sufficiently large\nn.\nRemarkably, LHV correlators p(k|x) for d = 2 are unaffected by increasing n using the pre-processing described\nabove [7]. The deterministic correlators, or vertices of P\nfor p(k|x) that LHV correlators achieve are always the linear Boolean functions. In this way, the computational power\nof LHV correlators is not boosted by increasing n and preprocessing for d = 2. We now show that for general d > 2\nthis no longer holds and computational power can be boosted.\nWe actually show something stronger: if any form of the preprocessing described above with sj = h(x) and |x| = n is al-\n\nlowed, then the computational power of LHV correlators will\nbe boosted.\nProposition 7. For arbitrary addition modulo d preprocessing on x leading to measurement settings sj = h(x),\nthe space of LHV correlators p(k|x) is not confined to the convex hull of n-partite linear functions on x for d > 2.\nProof. As before, we consider the deterministic maps p(k|s)\nand then take their convex hull. However, we now consider\nthe effect of pre-processing on x and make the assumption\nthat d > 2. When each party receives the input sj generated\nby the pre-processing, the input is sj = h(x) where h(x) =\nP|x|\nj=1 \u03b1j xj with \u03b1j \u2208 Zd . We now map into the space of\nall correlators p(k|x) under the influence of all possible preprocessing of the form h(x).\nFor LHV correlators, we need to consider all single site\nmaps Zd \u2192 Zd which can be written as a polynomial over\nZd as:\n(d\u22121) (d\u22121)\n\nmj =\n\nX X\ny=1\n\nd\u2212(z+1)\n\n\u000fy,z sj\n\n+ \u03b3,\n\n(34)\n\nz=0\n\n\u0001 z\nwhere \u000fy,z = \u03b2y (\u22121)z+1 d\u22121\nz y and \u03b3, \u03b2y \u2208 Zd . If we\nP|x|\nadd in the pre-processing stage where sj = j=1 \u03b1j xj then\nsingle site maps become polynomials in elements of xj , i.e.\nP|x|\nd\u2212(z+1)\nsj\n= ( j=1 \u03b1j xj )d\u2212(z+1) . Therefore for appropriately chosen \u03b2y and \u03b1j , there are now cross-terms between\nelements of xj , e.g. x1 x2 etc if d > 2. Because of this the\ndeterministic single-site maps with pre-processing cannot be\ndescribed as n-partite linear functions on x.\nIf we just have sj = xj and have n = |x| parties then\nthe LHV polytope is just the convex hull of n-partite linear functions on x. Pre-processing therefore can boost the\ncomputational power of LHV correlators to go beyond this\ncomputational description. However, not all polynomials of\nelements xj over Zd can be achieved by taking powers of\nP|x|\nthe linear functions j=1 \u03b1j xj . For example, the function\nQ|x|\nf (x) = j=1 xd\u22121\ncannot be achieved by this method. More\nj\ngenerally, any function that contains a term that is a non-npartite linear function of degree greater than d \u2212 1 cannot be\nachieved in any LHV theory for any value of n. So whilst\nthe LHV correlators are boosted by this pre-processing, the\nresulting LHV polytope does not encompass the convex hull\nof all functions f (x).\nKnowing that the boosted LHV polytope cannot achieve a\nQ|x|\nfunction such as f (x) = j=1 xjd\u22121 , we can construct a nontrivial Bell inequality for this function for all n \u2265 |x|. Instead\nof finding the upper bound for LHV correlators by taking the\nsupremum over all n-partite linear functions, we now have to\ntake the supremum over all possible linear pre-processing for\nall n maps of the form (34). This added complication highlights the uniqueness and simplicity of the case for d = 2,\nwhere one only needs to take the supremum over all linear\nBoolean functions of x even with pre-processing.\n\n\f14\nIn the case where the number of possible inputs at each\nsite is different from the number of possible outputs, there are\nother complications. We illustrate this with an example in the\n(3, 2, 3) setting but with a bit-string x \u2208 Z22 . We have three\nparties with pre-processing on x leading to inputs: s1 = x1 ,\ns2 = x2 and s3 = [x1 + x2 ]2 . With this pre-processing one\ncan achieve the non-n-partite linear function f (x) = x1 x2\nwith the n-partite linear function f (s) = 2s1 + 2s2 + s3 and\nthis pre-processing as 2x1 + 2x2 + [x1 +x2 ]2 = \u03b41x1 x2 . Therefore even with c = 2 and d > 2, the LHV polytope is also no\nlonger confined to n-partite linear functions on x.\nThe effect of processing on LHV correlators in the general\nframework of Bell tests is pointedly different from the twomeasurements, two-outcome case. We hope to illustrate that\nthere is a richness in structure in how information processing\naffects classical correlations and an appreciation of the connections between computation and correlators to give a handle\non the effect of processing. In [7], the effect of processing can\nbe seen to have a role in creating so-called loopholes in Bell\ntests and it is worthwhile exploring loopholes in the framework of data processing described here.\nWe also hope these results really emphasize why the\n(n, 2, 2) setting is so special and such a powerful platform\nfor distinguishing between classical and non-classical correlators. Even with linear Boolean pre-processing, the classical\ncomputation possible with LHV correlators is well characterized. This is still a computationally interesting setting as two\ninputs and two outputs at each site already enables quantum\ncomputing and the richness of structure that comes with that.\nDespite the fact that MBQC can be generalized to the setting\nwith more inputs and outputs at each site, the same LHV structure does not retain the same character in this setting.\nV.\n\nSUMMARY AND OPEN QUESTIONS\n\nIn this paper, we have explored the relatively under-studied\nmulti-setting, multi-outcome Bell inequality test in the context of the computational perspective of Bell tests, which has\nallowed us to derive new families of non-trivial Bell inequalities. We have presented our work in terms of correlators and\nnot the full measurement statistics of an experiment for clarity\nand convenience. However, we have shown that a significant\namount of the structure of the space of non-signaling probability distributions are captured by this setting.\nWe have shown that LHV theories can be generally considered in terms of limited computational expressiveness, i.e.\nLHV theories can only evaluate n-partite linear functions as\ndefined.

Given this interpretation, we can construct an\ninfinite class of non-trivial Bell inequalities. Furthermore we\nhave explicitly constructed facet Bell inequalities that define\nthe region of LHV correlators using the construction of LHV\ncorrelators in this paper.\nCentral to this paper is the incorporation of a computational\nperspective using modulo arithmetic into the more established\npicture of the convex polytopes of LHV theories. This perspective provides a broad arena to explore and, while we have\ngiven some insight, many open questions still remain. Firstly,\nwhat is the general correspondence between non-n-partite linear functions and facet Bell inequalities? There seems to be\na one-to-one or a one-to-two correspondence in certain settings but this is not always the case. There are many happy\ncoincidences that need further clarification.\nA huge open question is what exactly defines the quantum\nregion in our space of correlators? For the (n, 2, 2) correlator Bell test, we know that measurements on GHZ states form\nthe extreme points of the quantum region [10, 11]. However,\nlittle is known for other settings. At the moment finding the\neigenvectors for maximal violations of a Bell inequality has\nnot resulted in a general expression for the states that maximally violate the CGLMP inequality, if such a closed form\nexpression even exists. In addition, more study is needed to\ndetermine the effect of pre-processing on quantum correlators.\nIn [7], signaling correlators were simulated with postselection on measurement data. We have shown that the generalization of this post-selection leads to a boost in the power\nof LHV correlators; something that is akin to a loophole in a\nBell test. However, in the more general setting, does simulating signaling correlators also boost LHV correlators? Are\nthere more nuanced ways of processing data that does not expand the region of LHV correlators as occurs in Proposition\n7?\nIf a violation of a Bell inequality is a resource for information processing [2\u20134, 6, 8], then all aspects of Bell tests need\nto be explored to determine how we can best exploit this resource. We have tried to hint at how the richness of structure\nof abstract local hidden variable theories can be captured by\na simple computational picture. We hope that this work gives\nmore insight into the cooperative relationship between quantum information and the foundations of quantum mechanics.\nAcknowledgements - We would like to thank Hussain Anwar, Nicolas Brunner, Miguel Navascu\u00e9s and Stephen Bartlett\nfor interesting discussions.

We express the correlators p(k|s) nas the elements\nof a (d \u2212 1)cn vector in real space R(d\u22121)c . To simplify\nwe describe the inequalities in terms of a vector ~b that has\ninner product with correlator column vectors p~ to form the\nBell inequality, i.e. ~b * p~ \u2264 \u03b3L . The coefficients correspond to elements going from left-to-right as p(1|0, 0, ..., 0),\np(2|0, 0, ..., 0) up to p(d \u2212 1|c \u2212 1, c \u2212 1, ..., c \u2212 1). We will\nuse this notation in the next two sections of the appendix. For\nthe (2, 2, 5) setting, there are 4 symmetry classes of facet Bell\ninequalities (excluding the class of positivity and normalization inequalities). One of these is the CGLMP inequality and\nthe other three are given by the vectors of coefficients\n~b1 = 1 (6, 2, 3, 4, 4, \u22122, 2, 1, 4, \u22122, 2, 1, \u22124, 2, \u22122, \u22121) ,\n2\n~b2 = (3, 1, \u22121, \u22123, 2, \u22121, \u22124, \u22122, 2, \u22121, \u22124, \u22122, \u22122, 1, 4, 2) ,\n~b3 = (2, \u22121, 1, \u22122, 3, 1, \u22121, 2, 3, 1, \u22121, 2, \u22123, \u22121, 1, \u22122) .\n(A1)\nDenoting by Ij the inequality corresponding to ~bj , I1 and the\nCGLMP inequality are maximally violated by the vertex corresponding to f (s) = s1 s2 + 1 and I2 and I3 are maximally\nviolated by the vertex corresponding to f (s) = 2s1 s2 + 1.\nThe LHV bounds for all of the inequalities are listed in Tab.\nIII with their quantum violation.\nAs we have seen there is a corresponding function for each\nof these inequalities that leads to a maximal violation. Each\nof these functions is a vertex in the general space of Bell correlators mentioned in the paper.\n\nAppendix B: Generalization to non-prime number of settings\n\nIn this paper, we focused on the case where c and d are prime.\nHowever, this assumption is not needed to prove all the results. We now give a quick overview of how we describe LHV\ncorrelators in terms of polynomials on inputs for non-prime\nc. For non-prime number of settings, the number of inputs\nat each site c can be just expressed as the Cartesian product\nof the prime factors of c, i.e. Zc \u2192 Zc1 \u00d7 Zc2 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 Zcq\nwhere {c1 , c2 , ..., cq } is the set of prime factors of c and q is\n\n\f16\n\nB1\nB2\nB3\nB4\nB5\nB6\nB7\nB8\nB9\nB10\nB11\n1\nCc=4\n2\nCc=4\n3\nCc=4\n\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n1\n1\n1\n\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n2\n2\n2\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n-1\n-1\n-1\n-1\n-2\n-1\n-1\n1\n-1\n1\n0\n-1\n0\n0\n\n-1\n-1\n-2\n2\n2\n-1\n-1\n-1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n~b\n-2\n-2\n-1\n-2\n1\n1\n1\n0\n-1\n-1\n-1\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n\n-1\n-2\n-2\n-2\n-1\n-1\n1\n-1\n1\n-1\n1\n0\n-1\n0\n\n-2\n2\n1\n1\n-2\n-1\n-1\n-1\n0\n1\n-1\n0\n0\n-1\n\n2\n1\n2\n2\n2\n-1\n0\n1\n-1\n-1\n-1\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n-2\n-1\n-1\n-1\n-1\n1\n-1\n-1\n-1\n-1\n-1\n0\n0\n0\n\n2\n-2\n2\n-2\n-1\n-1\n-1\n-1\n-1\n-1\n-1\n0\n0\n0\n\npositivity inequalities). Three of these classes are forms of the\nCHSH inequality embedded in the larger number of inputs.\nFor completeness, we have listed all 14 Bell inequalities in\nTab. IV. We now explicitly write out one of these inequalities:\n\n1\n2\n-2\n-1\n-2\n0\n-1\n-1\n-1\n-1\n-1\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\nCc=4\n=\n\nv6=0\n\nwhere \u03b1j (\u03bb) \u2208 Zd and \u03b2jv (\u03bb) \u2208 Zd dependent on the local\nhidden variable \u03bb and 0 = {0, 0, ..., 0)}. We can use the redefinition of the delta function over Zc \u2192 Zc1 \u00d7Zc2 \u00d7...\u00d7Zcq\nused for each prime dimension Zck . This results in the map:\n\nv\u2208Zc ,\n\nq h\nY\nk=1\n\n1 \u2212 (tkj \u2212 vjk )(ck \u22121)\n\n2\nX\ns\ns\n(\u03b40j + \u03b41j )p(\nmj = 1|s) \u2264 2.\nj=1\n\ns\n\ns\n\ns\n\ns\n\n(\u03b40j + \u03b41j ) \u2192 (\u03b40s1 + \u03b42s1 )(\u03b40s2 + \u03b41s2 ),\n\n(B4)\n\nj=1\n\nv\u2208Zc ,\n\n\u03b2jv (\u03bb)\n\n2\nY\n\nj=1\n\ns\n\n2\nY\n\nthe number of prime factors in c.

The LHV upper bound for inequalities B1 , B2 , B3 , B4 , and\nB5 is 8 and 4 for B6 , B7 , B8 , B9 , B10 , and B11 .\n\nmj = \u03b1j (\u03bb) +\n\nX\n\ni\nck\n\n.\n\nv6=0\n\n(B2)\nOne then takes the sum modulo d of all of these single site\nmaps to obtain (a superficially complicated) map which is npartite linear as it only consists of single-site maps. There is\nalso no multiplication between values of tkj with other values\n0\nof tkj 0 for j 6= j 0 . Again there are dn(c\u22121)+1 possible deterministic maps for LHV theories, and their convex hull forms\nthe LHV polytope L.\nThe smallest value of non-prime d is 4 and so we studied the\nstructure of the LHV polytope for the (n, 4, 2) setting which\nhas 27 n-partite linear functions corresponding to the vertices\nof the LHV polytope. There are 27, 968 facet Bell inequalities\nfor this setting found with Polymake [39] which reduces to 15\nsymmetry classes (14 excluding the class of normalization and\n\n3\nand for Cc=3\n:\n2\nY\n\n(\u03b40j + \u03b41j ) \u2192 (\u03b40s1 + \u03b42s1 )(\u03b40s2 + \u03b42s2 ).\n\n(B5)\n\nj=1\n\nThroughout the whole of the paper, we have assumed that d\nhas been prime. Indeed, this fact has been vital in the proof of\nTheorem 2, so this proof fails for non-prime d. However, for\nother aspects of the methods in this paper, a non-prime d has\nlittle consequence for our construction of correlators. There\nare two approaches to considering non-prime d: the most obvious approach is just to think of representing outcomes as a\nstring of digits from prime number registers as with the description of settings above; secondly, instead of having the\nelements f (s) of a function as elements of a vector in a vector space over Zd for prime d, we now have elements of a\nmodule over Zd ; a generalization of a vector space. Since\nwe only ever take addition of functions represented in a Kronecker delta function basis to generate all functions, all of our\nmethods generalize to these modules.\nFrom the aspect of functions, the only difference for nonprime d is the fact that f (y) in (2) can now take values from\na non-prime register Zd . The derivation of all functions and\nn-partite linear functions generalizes naturally. For (2, 2, 4)\nwith the smallest non-prime d = 4, we present the facet Bell\ninequalities. There are four symmetry classes for this setting\nof which one is the class of positivity and normalization inequalities. One of these three non-trivial symmetry classes\nis formed by the CGLMP inequality. The second is another\ngeneralization of the CHSH inequality and is of the form:\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n2\n2\nX\nX\nX\n(\u22121)s1 s2 \uf8f0p(\nmj = 1|s) + p(\nmj = 3|s)\uf8fb \u2264 2,\ns\n\nj=1\n\nj=1\n\n(B6)\nwhich is essentially the CHSH inequality if each party groups\ntheir outcomes mj into modulo 2 terms. In other words, since\n1 mod 2 is equal to 3 mod 2, the above inequality is equivalent\nto the CHSH inequality if each party just maps from mod 4\narithmetic to mod 2.\n\n\f17\nThe third and final symmetry class is generated by the following inequality (expressed in the notation described earlier):\n(1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, \u22121, \u22122, \u22121) * p~ \u2264 4.\n\n(B7)\n\nThe deterministic map or function f (s) that achieves the max-\n\nimal upper bound 6 of this inequality for all correlators in\nP is f (s) = 2s1 s2 +P\n2. It is worth noting that this can be\nconstructed by adding s 2(\u22121)s1 s2 p(2|s) to the previous inequality.\n\n\f"}
