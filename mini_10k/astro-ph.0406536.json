The cluster has a moderate temperature (kT = 4.1 \u00b1\n0.3 keV) and appears to be relaxed. Emission is detected at \u2265 3\u03c3 significance\nto a radius of 88% of R200 (the radius enclosing an overdensity of 200 times\nthe critical density at z = 0.624) in a surface-brightness profile.

Cluster mass is the property most\ndirectly related to the predictions of cosmological models, but also one of the most difficult to measure. Xray observations directly measure the properties of the\ngaseous intra-cluster medium (ICM), which can be used\nto derive the total gravitating mass of a cluster, provided that the gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium. This\nderivation also requires knowledge of the temperature\nstructure of the gas. Thus to measure accurate cluster\nmasses with X-ray observations, detailed measurements\nof the dynamical state of the ICM and its temperature\nstructure are needed. Such observations of local clusters are becoming common, but detailed studies, and\nparticularly measurements of ICM temperature structure at high z (z \u2265 0.6), are very rare (Jeltema et al.\n2001; Arnaud et al. 2002; Maughan et al. 2004).\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: bjm@star.sr.bham.ac.uk\n\nc 0000 RAS\n\nClJ0046.3+8530 was discovered as an extended Xray source in the Wide Angle ROSAT Pointed Survey\n(WARPS: Scharf et al. 1997; Perlman et al. 2002), and\nconfirmed as a galaxy cluster with redshift z = 0.624.\nThe identification was based on its extended X-ray nature, an overdensity of faint galaxies, and concordant\noptical spectroscopic redshifts of two galaxies, including the the galaxy coincident with the X-ray centroid\n(Horner et al. 2004). The redshift of the cluster is confirmed below via an X-ray redshift measurement. Prior\nto the observation detailed here, relatively little was\nknown about the cluster's properties. ClJ0046.3+8530\nfalls 11\u2032 off-axis in two consecutive XMM-Newton observations of the open star cluster NGC 188, taken on the\n29\u221230 October 2000 (observation identifiers 0100640101\nand 0100640201) using the medium filter. The analysis\nof these data are described below, and the properties of\nthe system are derived and discussed.\nA \u039bCDM cosmology of H0 = 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ,\nand \u03a9M = 0.3 (\u03a9\u039b = 0.7) is adopted throughout, and all\nerrors are quoted at the 68% level. At the cluster's redshift, 1\u2032\u2032 corresponds to 6.8 kpc in this cosmology. The\nvirial radius is defined here as R200 , the radius within\n\n\f2\n\nB.J. Maughan et al.\n\nwhich the mean density is 200 times the critical density\nat the redshift of observation.\n\n1400\n\n2\n\nOPTICAL OBSERVATIONS\n\nThe\nfirst\noptical\nfollow-up\nobservation\nof\nClJ0046.3+8530 was obtained in August 1997 in\nthe form of a 3 \u00d7 4 minute exposure in the R band with\nthe University of Hawaii's 2.2m telescope. Mediocre\natmospheric conditions combined with a high airmass\nof 2.2 resulted in poor seeing of 1.2 arcsec as measured\noff the combined final image. Deeper imaging was\nperformed subsequently in August 2001 in the R and\nI bands (40 and 20 min respectively) with the 4.2m\nWilliam-Herschel Telescope (WHT). Again, the seeing\nwas 1.2 arcsec. All the imaging data were reduced\nin the standard manner. Observations of 6 standard\nstars of Landolt (1992) were used to calibrate the\nWHT photometry. Galaxy number counts made in\nan area excluding the cluster were consistent with\nthose of K\u00fcmmel & Wagner (2001) and Metcalfe et al.\n(1991), confirming the accuracy of the photometry, and\nindicated that the limiting magnitude was R = 22.\nSpectroscopic observations of galaxies in the field\nof ClJ0046.3+8530 were performed on the Keck 10m\ntelescope using the LRIS low-dispersion spectrograph\n(Oke et al. 1995) in August 1997. The instrumental\nsetup combined a 2048\u00d72048 Tektronix CCD with\n24\u03bcm pixels (LRIS-R CCD2), the 300/5000 grating, the\nGG495 order blocking filter, and a longslit of 1.5\u2032\u2032 width\nto obtain a dispersion of 2.5 \u00c5/pixel over a spectral\nrange extending from 5150 to 8950\u00c5. Two galaxies were\nobserved for a total of 900 seconds. The airmass of the\ntargets was 2.4, the seeing 1.0 arcsec. Standard image\nprocessing techniques were used to reduce the obtained\ndata, and the measured redshifts are given in Table 1.\n\n3\n\nEffective area (cm2)\n\n1200\n\nDATA PREPARATION\n\nThe two XMM-Newton observations of ClJ0046.3+8530\nwere filtered, cleaned and prepared in the standard\nway (see Maughan et al. (2004) for details), to give two\nevents lists for each detector. Both observations were\naffected by brief periods of high background, and their\nremoval left 30 ks (observation 1) and 50 ks (observation 2) of good time. After cleaning, the mean PN\ncount rates in the 10 \u2212 15 keV energy band (excluding\nbright sources) were consistent with that found in the\nLumb et al. (2002) blank-sky background files, indicating that the high-background periods were successfully\nremoved.\nThe position of ClJ0046.3+8530 near the edge of\nthe field of view raised important calibration issues. The\n90% encircled energy radius of the Point Spread Function (PSF) at 1.5 keV increases from 47\u2032\u2032 on-axis to 52\u2032\u2032\nat the cluster centroid for the MOS detectors, and from\n51\u2032\u2032 to 65\u2032\u2032 for the PN detector. These values were derived with the Calview tool in the XMM-Newton Science Analysis Software (SAS). Following recent advice\n\n1000\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\n\nOff-axis angle (arcsec)\n\nFigure 1. The radial dependence of the PN effective area at\n1.5 keV. The dashed line marks the cluster position.\n\nfrom the XMM-Newton help-desk1 these encircled energies were computed using the 'EXTENDED' accuracy\nsetting in Calview. This is the most accurate method for\nestimating encircled energies, and is valid at all off-axis\nangles. These encircled energy radii are therefore more\nup-to-date than the values given in the XMM-Newton\nuser's handbook v2.1. In addition, the shape of the PSF\nchanges from being radially symmetric at the optical\naxis, to a more arc-like shape, elongated orthogonally\nto the radial direction. In our modelling of the cluster's\nsurface-brightness distribution, where the shape of the\nPSF is important, model PSFs are computed with the\n'MEDIUM' accuracy setting in Calview, which provides\nthe only two-dimensional models of the PSF.\nThe effective area also decreases strongly with offaxis angle. Fig. 1 shows the dependence of effective area\non off-axis angle; at 700\u2032\u2032 , the off-axis angle of the cluster position, the effective area has fallen to less than\n50% of the on-axis value. These instrumental issues are\naccounted for as much as possible in the following analysis, and their possible effects are discussed.\nIn addition, the energy-dependent vignetting function of the telescopes has recently been verified by observations of compact supernova remnants at a range of\noff-axis angles and azimuths (Lumb et al. 2004). This\nanalysis revealed a misalignment of \u2248 1\u2032 in the optical axis of the telescopes containing the PN and MOS2\ncameras. For the cluster location in this observation, the\npossible discrepancy in the assumed vignetting would\nmean that the PN flux has been overestimated by \u2248 6%\nand the MOS2 flux underestimated by \u2248 8%. A secondary effect of the energy dependence would be that\nthe corresponding temperatures would also be slightly\nover- and under-estimated respectively. These effects are\nnot accounted for in the following analysis, as the uncertainties introduced are small compared to the statistical\nuncertainties.\n\n1\n\nSee http://xmm.vilspa.esa.es/xmmhelp/Calibration?id=9356\nfor a discussion of PSF issues.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fXMM-Newton observations of ClJ0046.3+8530\n\nFigure 2. An exposure-corrected image of the XMM-Newton\nfield of view. Data from both observations are combined, and\nbinned with image pixels of 4.4\u2032\u2032 . The inset is a blow-up of\nthe dashed region, and clearly shows ClJ0046.3+8530 and\nXMMU J004751.7+852722 as extended sources.\n\n4\n\nX-RAY IMAGING ANALYSIS\n\nImages and exposure maps were produced for the PN\nand MOS cameras for both observations in the energy range 0.3 \u2212 5 keV to maximise signal-to-noise. The\nexposure maps for each instrument were \"spectrally\nweighted\" by creating several exposure maps produced\nin narrow energy bands, in which the energy dependence\nof the vignetting function was small. These maps were\nweighted by the photon flux predicted in each energy\nband by the best-fitting spectral model to the global\ncluster emission (see \u00a75) and summed. The images and\nweighted exposure maps for each camera were then combined to give a mosaiced image and map. The exposure map was normalised so that its value at the cluster centroid was 1, and the image was divided by the\nresult. This removes the effects of vignetting and chip\ngaps, while maintaining as far as possible the Poissonian statistics of the data. An exposure-corrected image\nof the field of view, combining the data from both observations is shown in Fig 2. The diffuse emission from\nClJ0046.3+8530 is visible near the Northern edge of the\nfield of view, and the increasing PSF distortion with offaxis angle is apparent.\nThe exposure-corrected image was adaptively\nsmoothed so that all remaining features were significant at \u2265 99% confidence, and contours of the smoothed\nemission were overlaid on an R-band optical image, as\nshown in Fig. 3. Ignoring the distortion of the contours\ncaused by the two point sources to the South, the contours appear fairly circular, indicating that the cluster's\natmosphere is reasonably relaxed.\nThe two galaxies with measured redshifts are labelled in Fig. 3, and their positions and redshifts are\ngiven in Table 1.

Contours of this emission\n(smoothed to 99% significance) are overlaid on an optical image in Fig. 4. The centroid of this extended\nemission coincides with the 2MASS galaxy 2MASX\nJ00475079+8527213 (K = 13.5 \u00b1 0.2 mag). Within\na radius of 32\u2032\u2032 from the source centroid, a total of\n\u2248 500 net photons were detected, using a local background annulus, and excluding point sources and emission from ClJ0046.3+8530. The properties of XMMU\nJ004751.7+852722 are discussed in \u00a77 and \u00a78.\n4.2\n\nModelling the surface-brightness\ndistribution of ClJ0046.3+8530\n\nThe surface-brightness distribution of ClJ0046.3+8530\nwas modelled in Sherpa with a two-dimensional (2D)\nmethod. A 0.3 \u2212 5 keV image from each detector (without exposure correction) was fit with a surface brightness model which was multiplied by an appropriate exposure map, and convolved with a PSF. Due to the low\nnumbers of counts in a typical pixel, the Cash statistic (Cash 1979) was used when fitting the models. The\ncluster emission model used was a 2D parameterisation\nof the \u03b2-model (Cavaliere & Fusco-Femiano 1976). Two\nadditive background model components were used. The\nfirst was a simple constant-background model which,\nafter multiplication by the exposure map should accurately represent a flat, but vignetted X-ray back-\n\n\f4\n\nB.J.

Contours of a smoothed X-ray image of XMMU\nJ004751.7+852722 from both observations and all EPIC\ndetectors overlaid on a WHT R-band image. The contours are logarithmically spaced above the lowest contour at\n0.25 counts pixel\u22121 , which is 1.5 times the local background\nlevel.\n\nground. The second background component consisted\nof a 0.3 \u2212 5 keV image produced from closed-filter data,\nto account for the particle background. This particle\nimage was divided by the exposure map, so that after\nmultiplication by the exposure map in the fitting process, the background model consisted of a vignetted and\na non-vignetted component (see Maughan et al. (2004)\nfor a discussion of the background components and these\nmodels).\nDue to the large wings of the PSF at the detector\nposition of the cluster, it was not possible to fully exclude point source emission without excluding almost all\nof the cluster emission. Instead, the point sources within\nthe fitting region were modelled as delta functions, and\ntheir position and amplitude were fit to the data. This\nprocedure is not ideal, because the fitting software only\nallows the model being fit to be convolved with one PSF\nper dataset, while the shape of the PSF varies over the\ndetector region spanned by the cluster emission (as can\nbe seen in Fig. 3). Calview was used to generate PSF\nimages for the detector position of the cluster centroid\nat an energy of 1.5 keV for each detector (the PSF is\nnot strongly energy dependent in the 0.3 \u2212 5 keV band).\nThe 'MEDIUM' accuracy level was used, which provides\nthe only available 2D model of the XMM-Newton PSF,\nincluding its arc-like distortion at the cluster off-axis\nangle.\nThese models were fit simultaneously to the PN and\nMOS images from each observation. The results of the\nfits were not consistent between the observations. The\n\nbest-fitting \u03b2-profile core radius (rc ) and slope (\u03b2) are\n+0.06\n\u2032\u2032\nrc = 11.5+2.8\n\u22122.3 and \u03b2 = 0.49\u22120.02 in observation 1, and\n+0.08\n+4.4 \u2032\u2032\nrc = 20.2\u22123.6 and \u03b2 = 0.60\u22120.03 in observation 2. This\ndiscrepancy was investigated in detail, and is likely to be\ncaused by a combination of the large PSF, uncertainties\nin its modelling, and a variation in the flux of brightest point source between the observations. The count\nrate from the bright point source to the South East was\n25% higher in the first observation. Given the uncertainties in modelling the PSF, it is likely that there is\nmore point source contamination remaining in observation 1, increasing the number of counts at large radii,\nwhich would cause the \u03b2-profile slope to fit to a lower\nvalue. In addition, the core radii found in both observations are small compared to the PSF, which means they\nmay not be reliably measured. This would also affect\nthe values of \u03b2 as there is degeneracy between the two\nparameters. These fits were repeated with the core radii\nfixed at 22\u2032\u2032 , which corresponds to 150 kpc, a value typical of local clusters (e.g. Jones & Forman 1999). With\nthis constraint, the best-fitting values of all other parameters are consistent between the observations.\nWith this in mind, we chose to use only observation 2 in our imaging analysis because it was the longer\nobservation, with better signal-to-noise, and the point\nsource contamination is lower. The best-fitting model\n\u2032\u2032\nand \u03b2 = 0.60+0.08\nhas rc = 20.2+4.4\n\u22120.03 , with a low el\u22123.6\nlipticity of 0.07, and we proceed with these values for\nall further analysis. With rc fixed at this value, fitting\nto the observation 1 data gives \u03b2 = 0.57 \u00b1 0.05, consistent with the above result. Fig. 5 shows a radial profile\nof the best-fitting 2D model, including instrumental effects, plotted on a profile of the data. The point sources\nwere not excluded from the profile of the data in this\ncomparison, because they are included in the 2D model.\nThe dotted line is a profile of the best-fitting background\nmodel components. These profiles show that the model\nis a reasonably good description of the data, although\nit is clear again that the point sources at \u2248 50\u2032\u2032 and\n\u2248 100\u2032\u2032 are not perfectly modelled. The dip in the profiles at \u2248 130\u2032\u2032 is due to the edge of the PN CCD. This\nis apparent in both the data and the models because\nthe models have been multiplied by exposure maps to\nreplicate the instrumental effects in the data.\nIn order to measure the extent of the detection,\na one-dimensional radial profile of the X-ray emission\nwas extracted from the combined (both observations,\nall cameras) exposure corrected image. Point sources\nwere excluded out to a radius of 20\u2032\u2032 , and the profile\nwas adaptively binned so that all radial bins were significant at the 3\u03c3 level above the background.

For comparison, background spectra were\nextracted both locally, and from blank-sky background\nfiles. The results of the spectral analysis were found to\nbe independent of the background type used, so local\nbackground spectra were used in all further analysis, as\nthe systematic uncertainties involved were considered\nto be smaller. The source spectra were extracted within\na circle of radius 88\u2032\u2032 centred on the cluster centroid,\ncorresponding approximately to the 3\u03c3 detection radius\nin each separate observation (as opposed to the 3\u03c3 detection radius of 142\u2032\u2032 when the observations were combined). The strong radial dependence of effective area\nat the cluster position (Fig. 1) was taken into consideration when selecting the regions from which to extract\nthe local background spectra. Exposure maps of each\ndetector were used to select spatial regions where the\nmean effective exposure (equivalent to effective area)\nwas close to that in the source spectrum extraction region. Ancillary response files (ARFs), weighted by the\nspatial distribution of counts in the source region, were\nalso generated for the cluster's off-axis position.\nThe two point sources to the South fell within the\nsource region, and their emission was excluded to a radius of 20\u2032\u2032 (\u2248 75% encircled energy radius of the PSF\nof all XMM-Newton telescopes at 0.3 \u2212 5 keV). Due to\nthe large PSF wings, and its elongation at this off-axis\nangle, some point source contamination will remain, and\nthe effect of this is examined below.\nThe spectra from the three EPIC detectors in\nthe 0.3 \u2212 5 keV band were each grouped to give \u2265\n20 counts per energy bin, and were fit simultaneously with an absorbed MeKaL model. This was done\nfor the two observations independently, and the bestfitting model parameters were consistent. All spectra\nfor both observations were then fit simultaneously with\nan absorbed MeKaL model. The best-fitting temperature and metallicity are kT = 4.1 \u00b1 0.3 keV and\nZ = 0.39+0.14\n\u22120.13 respectively, when the absorbing column was frozen at the Galactic value of 7.6 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122\n(Dickey & Lockman 1990), with \u03c72 /\u03bd = 372/360. This\nmodel is shown with the data in Fig. 8. When the absorbing column is allowed to vary, the best-fitting value\nis (6.8 \u00b1 1.2) \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 , consistent with the Galactic\nvalue. In addition, an X-ray redshift was measured, and\nthe best-fitting value is z = 0.615+0.008\n\u22120.006 , which supports\n\nFigure 8. All EPIC spectra for observations 1 and 2\nof ClJ0046.3+8530, and the best-fitting absorbed MeKaL\nmodel. Absorption is frozen at the Galactic value. For presentation purposes, the data from the same instruments in\nthe two observations have been combined for this plot, and\nadjacent bins have been combined to give a minimum signalto-noise ratio of 3. The lower panel shows the ratio of data\nto model values.\n\nthe optical redshift of 0.624 ascribed to the cluster based\non the two measured galaxy redshifts.\nThe spectrum of the soft, bright point source to\nthe South East was examined, using a local annulus as\na background region, to ensure that the cluster emission is also included in the background spectrum. The\nspectrum is well fit by an unabsorbed MeKaL model\n(\u03c72 /\u03bd = 9.95/10) of kT = 0.53+0.13\n\u22120.10 keV and Z =\n0.06 \u00b1 0.03Z\u2299 . The redshift of this model was frozen\nat zero. A power-law model is rejected at the 95% level\nby the data, supporting the conclusion that the emission\nis stellar. The unabsorbed flux from this point source is\n(8.4\u00b11.9)\u00d710\u221215 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 in the 0.5\u22122 keV band.\nTo test whether the emission from this star affected\nthe cluster spectrum, a cluster spectrum was extracted\nincluding this source, and its emission was included in\nthe model. The model used was an absorbed MeKaL\nmodel at z = 0.624 plus an unabsorbed MeKaL model\nat z = 0. The best-fitting temperatures of the cluster\n+0.18\nand star are kT = 4.8+1.2\n\u22120.8 keV and 0.38\u22120.08 keV respectively, with \u03c72 /\u03bd = 112.4/121. The good agreement\nbetween these fits, and those found when fitting the\nsources independently indicates that the cluster emission is not seriously contaminated by the star, and\nmost importantly, that the temperature measured for\nthe cluster is not influenced by any remaining stellar\nemission.\nA cluster spectrum was also extracted with the\nemission from the harder South-West point source included. When this spectrum was fit with an absorbed\nMeKaL model, the best-fitting temperature was 4.9 \u00b1\n0.5 keV, hotter than the best-fitting temperature when\nthat point source was excluded. This is consistent with\nthe harder spectrum of that source. When an additional\nabsorbed power-law component with a spectral index of\n1.5 was included in the model, the best-fitting MeKaL\ntemperature reduced to 3.8 \u00b1 1.0 keV, which agrees well\nwith the cluster temperature measured when the SouthWest point source was excluded. This suggests that the\ncluster spectrum was not significantly contaminated by\nSouth-West point source after it was excluded.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fXMM-Newton observations of ClJ0046.3+8530\n\n5.1\n\nTemperature Profile\n\nWith \u223c 5000 net counts (all EPIC detectors combined)\nwithin the detection radius, it was possible to measure a\ntemperature profile of the gas in ClJ0046.3+8530. Spectra were extracted in 3 annular bins for all detectors,\nand both observations, and fit simultaneously with an\nabsorbed MeKaL model, with the abundance frozen at\n0.3Z\u2299 , and the absorbing column frozen at the Galactic value. A locally extracted background spectrum was\nused. The best-fitting temperatures are shown in Fig.\n9, and are consistent (with large errors) with the global\ntemperature of 4.1\u00b10.3 keV, though the outer bin could\nindicate cooler gas at larger radii. The spectral fit to\nthe data from the outer bin was also performed in the\n2 \u2212 8 keV band, to test the effect of any contaminating\nemission from the bright point source. The best-fitting\ntemperature agrees well (with large errors) with that\nshown in Fig. 9. The data do not suggest any cool gas\nin the central regions.\nThe effect of emission from gas in the outer annuli\nbeing projected onto the inner annuli was modelled with\nan 'onion skin' method. The temperature structure was\nmodelled as a series of spherical shells (each of which\nwas isothermal), and the spectra were fit from the outermost shell in. The spectrum of a shell was modelled\nwith a single temperature MeKaL component, plus a\nMeKaL component for each external shell, whose temperature was fixed at the value measured in that shell,\nand whose normalisation was multiplied by a scale factor. These scale factors accounted for the volume of each\nexternal shell along the line of sight to the shell being fit,\nand the variation in density across each external shell\nusing the measured gas density profile. The deprojected\ntemperatures are also plotted in Fig. 9. The form of this\ndeprojected profile is not significantly different from the\nprojected profile, and does not reveal any central cool\ngas, although the size of the errors is increased, as one\nwould expect, as there were less photons available to\nconstrain the temperature of the free component in the\ninterior bins.\nIt should be noted that the effect of the large PSF\nmixing the emission between annular bins was not taken\ninto account here. The 90% encircled energy radius of\nthe PSF at the position of the cluster at 1.5 keV is \u2248 65\u2032\u2032\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n9\n\nprojected kT\ndeprojected kT\n\n8\n\n7\n\nT (KeV)\n\nAs a further test, the cluster emission model was\nfit to the data with the point sources excluded, in the\nenergy range 2 \u2212 8 keV. In this band the contribution\nfrom the soft stellar source should be negligible. The\nbest-fitting temperature is kT = 4.1+1.1\n\u22120.8 keV, providing\nfurther evidence that the measured temperature was not\naffected by point source contamination.\nThe flux of ClJ0046.3+8530 measured by ROSAT\nin the 0.5 \u2212 2 keV passband is 1.6 \u00d7 10\u221213 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122\n(Horner et al. 2004) when extrapolated to an infinite\nradius.

(2004).\nIn summary, the total mass profile was derived assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, spherical symmetry, and\nisothermality, and used to define an overdensity profile with respect to the critical density at the redshift of\nobservation. The virial radius, R200 , was then defined\nas the radius corresponding to an overdensity of 200.\nThe central gas density was computed from the measured MeKaL normalisation, and used to normalise the\ngas density profile. The errors on all the non-measured\nquantities were derived by 10, 000 Monte-Carlo ran-\n\n\f8\n\nB.J.

This greatly reduces the uncertainties in extrapolating the cluster properties to R200 . The gas mass\nfraction of the system at R200 is found to be 16 \u00b1 4%.\nThe properties of ClJ0046.3+8530 are summarised in\nTable 2.\n\nI \u2248 1.3 in the ClJ0046.3+8530 galaxies, while a\nstronger sequence at R \u2212 I \u2248 1 is clear in the galaxies of XMMU J004751.7+852722. This indicates that\nXMMU J004751.7+852722 is at a lower redshift than\nClJ0046.3+8530, perhaps unsurprising given the coincidence of the source with the relatively bright 2MASS\ngalaxy.\nTo\nestimate\nthe\nredshift\nof\nXMMU\nJ004751.7+852722, the stellar population synthesis models of Bruzual A. & Charlot (1993) were used\nto predict the normalisation of the red sequence vs.\nredshift. A single stellar population was used with a\nburst of star formation at zf =3 and passive evolution\nthereafter, a Salpeter IMF and solar metallicity. These\nare typical values found for cluster elliptical evolution\nstudies (e.g. Ellis & Jones 2004). Similar results are\nobtained if zf =2 is assumed. The predicted colours\nwere normalised to those of the Coma cluster at L\u2217\nEisenhardt et al. (2004). The resulting predictions have\nbeen plotted in Figs. 11 and 12 for redshifts z=0.624\nand z=0.25, using appropriate values for the slope\nfrom the Coma cluster compilation of Eisenhardt et al.\n(2004). The prediction matches the observed colours\nof the red sequence galaxies in ClJ0046.3+8530, and a\nredshift of z=0.25 is a good match to the red sequence\nin XMMU J004751.7+852722.\nThe BCG in XMMU J004751.7+852722 has\nR=17.4 and K\u224813.5, at the limit of the 2MASS sensitivity. The R-K colour is consistent with that of local\nelliptical galaxies when the k-corrections are taken into\naccount. Assuming the redshift of z = 0.25 is correct,\nthe absolute magnitude is MR \u2248 \u221223.4+5log(h70 ), and\nthis is a luminous giant elliptical galaxy, comparable in\nluminosity to BCGs in some rich, high LX systems.\n\n7\n\nOPTICAL IMAGING ANALYSIS\n\nThe R and I band WHT images were used to investigate the properties of the galaxies in ClJ0046.3+8530\nand XMMU J004751.7+852722. Galaxies were selected\nby using SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996), and\ntheir R \u2212 I colours and total magnitudes were measured. Colours were measured using apertures chosen to maximise signal to noise, and total magnitudes were obtained from the SExtractor MAG AUTO\nmeasurements. Magnitudes and colours were corrected\nfor Galactic extinction using the measurements of\nSchlegel et al. (1998). The galaxies within a radius 65\u2032\u2032\nof the X-ray centroid of the XMMU J004751.7+852722\nand within 60\u2032\u2032 (0.4R200 ) of the X-ray centroid of\nClJ0046.3+8530 were then selected. These are plotted on a colour-magnitude diagram in Figs. 11 and\n12. Galaxy B in ClJ0046.3+8530, with a spectrally\nconfirmed redshift, is marked separately. The brightest cluster galaxy (galaxy A in Fig. 3) was partially blended with a bright star, leading to large\nuncertainties on its colour and magnitude, so is not\nshown here. There is a possible red sequence at R \u2212\n\n8\n\nPROPERTIES OF THE NEARBY\nCLUSTER XMMU J004751.7+852722\n\nA hardness ratio was computed for XMMU\nJ004751.7+852722, using the energy bands defined\nabove, giving HR = 1.74 \u00b1 0.24.

As the redshift of the source was not\ncertain, spectra were simulated at a range of redshifts,\ngiving a range of possible temperatures. At z = 0 the\nHR value corresponds to kT = 3.0+2.0\n\u22121.1 keV, increasing\nto kT = 4.8+2.3\n\u22121.4 keV at the estimated redshift z = 0.25.\nThe measured count rate was then converted to a\n0.5 \u2212 2 keV unabsorbed flux, using these derived\ntemperatures, giving FX = 5.4 \u00d7 10\u221215 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122\n(kT = 3.0 keV) and FX = 6.2 \u00d7 10\u221215 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122\n(kT = 4.8 keV). The corresponding bolometric X-ray\nluminosity at z=0.25 is LX \u2248 3 \u00d7 1042 erg s\u22121 (within\nthe measurement radius). We conclude that it is likely\nthat this extended source is a cluster at z\u22480.25 with\nlow LX .\n\n9\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe evolution of cluster entropy was investigated by\ncomparing the gas entropy measured at 0.1R200 in\nClJ0046.3+8530 with that measured in local systems\nby Ponman et al. (2003). Under self-similar models,\nentropy is simply proportional to temperature. However with a large sample of systems with high-quality\ndata, Ponman et al. (2003) found that this was not the\ncase. To remove the effect of temperature dependence,\nClJ0046.3+8530 was compared with a data bin of eight\nsystems in the temperature range 3.6 \u2212 4.6 keV with\n \u0304 = 4.1 \u00b1 0.4 keV (z\u0304 = 0.036). The entropy at 0.1R200\nkT\nin ClJ0046.3+8530 is S = 180 \u00b1 24 cm2 and the mean\nentropy of the eight local systems at the same radius is\nS = 327 \u00b1 42 cm2 .\nThe mean density within a given overdensity rac 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nUsing this formulation, the entropy in\nClJ0046.3+8530 was scaled to the mean redshift\nof the local systems (assuming that the systems\nvirialised at the redshift at which they are observed),\ngiving S = 285 \u00b1 40 cm2 , which is consistent with\nthe local systems. This result is consistent with a\nsimple self-similar evolution of entropy with redshift,\na result also seen in the massive, relaxed cluster\nClJ1226.9+3332 at z = 0.89 (Maughan et al. 2004).\nThis result will be investigated further with a larger\nsample of high-z clusters in a future paper.\nIn the context of other high-redshift (z \u2265 0.6) clusters observed with Chandra and XMM-Newton (e.g.\nVikhlinin et al. 2002; Arnaud et al. 2002; Holden et al.\n2002; Maughan et al. 2003, 2004; Rosati et al. 2004),\nClJ0046.3+8530 has an average temperature and mass.\nThe long exposure time of these two observations enabled the system to be studied in more detail than\nis usually possible at high redshift. The measurement of the gas temperature structure and detection\nof emission to approaching the virial radius is relatively rare; temperature profiles have been measured\nin only three other z \u2265 0.6 clusters, MS 1054-0321\n(Jeltema et al. 2001), RX J1120.1+4318 (Arnaud et al.\n2002) and ClJ1226.9+3332 (Maughan et al. 2004).\n14\nThe total gravitating mass of 3.0+0.6\n\u22120.5 \u00d7 10 M\u2299 derived for the system assumed isothermality, which is\nconsistent with the observed temperature profile, and\nalso supported by the hardness-ratio map. Thus this\nmass should be reasonably reliable. However, it is also\npossible that there is a temperature gradient present,\nwhich was not detected because of the effect of the\ntelescope PSF. In a sample of 66 local systems with\nmeasured temperature profiles Sanderson et al. (2003)\nfound that the incorrect assumption of isothermality\nleads to an average overestimate of the total mass by\n\u2248 30% at R200 . Thus this is a reasonable estimate of\nthe possible systematic error in our total mass measurement.\nThe measured metal abundance in ClJ0046.3+8530\nis consistent with the value of 0.3Z\u2299 found in\nsamples of low- and moderate-redshift clusters (e.g.\nMushotzky & Loewenstein 1997). In particular, the\ndata impose a 3\u03c3 lower limit of Z > 0.17Z\u2299 , which supports the growing evidence of a high redshift (z > 1) of\nenrichment of the ICM (e.g. Mushotzky & Loewenstein\n1997; Tozzi et al. 2003).\n\n\f10\n\nB.J. Maughan et al.\n\nThe gas mass fraction of fgas = 0.16 \u00b1 0.04 derived at R200 for ClJ0046.3+8530 should be a reasonably reliable measurement, because of the large extent\nof the surface-brightness and temperature profiles. This\nvalue is in good agreement with the mean gas mass\nfraction of fgas = 0.13 \u00b1 0.01 (also at R200 ) found by\nSanderson et al. (2003) in their large sample of local\nsystems. In a sample of 6 relaxed clusters in the redshift range 0.1 < z < 0.5 observed with Chandra , and\nwith reliable masses confirmed by gravitational lensing,\nAllen et al. (2002) found a mean gas mass fraction of\n0.113 \u00b1 0.005. While those measurements were made\nat a radius of r2500 (corresponding to a mean internal\ndensity of 2500 times the critical density), the value we\nderive for ClJ0046.3+8530 at R200 is consistent with the\nAllen et al. (2002) measurements.\nIn addition, the gas density slope parameter\n(\u03b2) measured here for ClJ0046.3+8530 is consistent\nwith those of similar temperature clusters in the\nSanderson et al. (2003) sample. Overall, these results\nsuggest that the enrichment and distribution of the ICM\nis similar in at least some high-redshift clusters to that\nin local clusters.\n\n10\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nA detailed XMM-Newton study of the high-redshift\ngalaxy cluster ClJ0046.3+8530 (z=0.624) was conducted. The circular appearance of the isophotes, and\nthe low ellipticity of the best-fitting surface brightness model suggest that the ICM is reasonably relaxed.\nA temperature profile and hardness-ratio map show\nno significant temperature structure. The metal abundance, gas-density profile slope, and gas-mass fraction of\nClJ0046.3+8530 are all consistent with those measured\nin local clusters. The entropy of ClJ0046.3+8530 measured at 0.1R200 is consistent with a self-similar model,\nin which high-z clusters are identical to their low-z counterparts, with their properties scaled by the increasing\n(with redshift) density of the universe in which they\nformed.\nThe properties of ClJ0046.3+8530, along with 10\nother high-redshift clusters from the WARPS, will be\nused to investigate the evolution of the scaling relations\nbetween cluster properties in a forthcoming paper.\n\n11\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe thank Simon Ellis for running the Bruzual-Charlot\nstellar population synthesis models to estimate the redshift of XMMU J004751.7+852722.
