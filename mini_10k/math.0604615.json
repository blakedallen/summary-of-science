Introduction\nThis is a write-up of of a tutorial series of three talks which I gave as part\nof the \"Workshop on Functional and Harmonic Analyses of Wavelets and\nFrames\" held August 4-7, 2004 at the National University of Singapore. I\nwill first give the titles and abstracts essentially as they appeared in the\nworkshop schedule. I will say that the actual style of write-up of these notes\nwill be structured a bit differently, but only in that more than three sections\nwill be given, and subsections indicated, to (hopefully) improve expositional\nquality.\n1\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\n2\n\nlarson-chapter\n\nLarson\n\n1.1. Talks and Abstracts\n(a) \"Unitary Systems and Wavelet Sets\": A wavelet is a special case of a\nvector in a separable Hilbert space that generates a basis under the action\nof a collection, or \"system\", of unitary operators defined in terms of translation and dilation operations. This approach to wavelet theory goes back,\nin particular, to earlier work of Goodman, Lee and Tang [25] in the context of multiresolution analysis. We will begin by describing the operatorinterpolation approach to wavelet theory using the local commutant of a\nsystem that was worked out by the speaker and his collaborators a few\nyears ago. This is really an abstract application of the theory of operator\nalgebras, mainly von Neumann algebras, to wavelet theory. The concrete\napplications of operator-interpolation to wavelet theory include results obtained using specially constructed families of wavelet sets. In fact X. Dai\nand the speaker had originally developed our theory of wavelet sets [11]\nspecifically to take advantage of their natural and elegant relationships\nwith these wavelet unitary systems. We will also discuss some new results\nand open questions.\n(b) \"Unitary Systems and Frames\": A frame is a sequence of vectors in a\nHilbert space which is a compression of a basis for a larger space. (This is not\nthe usual definition in the frame literature, but it is equivalent to the usual\ndefinition. In this spirit, the usual \"inequality\" definition can be thought\nof as an abstract characterization of a compression of a basis.) Because of\nthis compression relationship between frames and bases, the unitary system\napproach to wavelets (and more generally: wandering vectors) is perfectly\nadaptable to frame theory. This idea was developed into a theory a few\nyears ago by D. Han and the speaker [33]. The use of the local commutant\nis along the same lines.\n(c) \"Decompositions of Operators and Operator-Valued Frames\": We\nwill discuss some joint work with K. Kornelson and others on construction\nof frames with targeted properties [16, 42]. These are related to targeted\ndecompositions of positive operators.\n1.2. Some Background\nIt might be appropriate to give some comments of a personal-historical\nnature, before continuing with the technical aspects. My particular point\nof view on \"wavelet theory\", which was developed jointly with my good\nfriend and colleague Xingde Dai, began in the summer of 1992. Before then,\nI was strictly an operator theorist. I had heard my approximation theory\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\nWavelet Sets and Operator-Theoretic Interpolation\n\nlarson-chapter\n\n3\n\ncolleagues and friends at Texas A&M University talk about wavelets and\nframes, and Xingde had frequently mentioned these topics to me when he\nwas finishing his Ph.D. at A&M (he was my student, graduating in 1990,\nwith a thesis [9] on the subject of nest algebras). But it was this meeting\nof minds we had in June of 1992 that was the turning point for me. We\nformulated an approach to wavelet theory (and as it turned out ultimately,\nto frame-wavelet theory as well) that I felt we could \"really understand\" as\noperator algebraists. This was the abstract unitary system approach. Dai\nknew the unitary operator approach to multiresolution analysis that had\nbeen recently (at that time) published by Goodman, Lee and Tang 25], and\nhe suggested to me that we should try to go further with these ideas in an\nattempt to get a some type of tractable classification of all wavelets. We\nwent, in fact, in some completely different directions. The first paper that\ncame out of this was the AMS Memoir [11] with Dai. The second paper was\nour paper [12] with Dai and Speegle, which proved the existence of single\nwavelets in higher dimensions, for arbitrary expansive dilations. After that,\nseveral papers followed including the AMS Memoir [33] with Deguang Han,\nand the Wutam Consortium paper [52], as well as the papers [10, 13, 26,\n27, 28, 30, 34, 43, 44] by my students Dai, Gu, Han and Lu, and their\ncollaborators, and the papers [2, 39, 40] with my colleagues Azoff, Ionascu,\nand Pearcy.\nThe paper [11] with Dai mentioned above, which was published in 1998,\nculminated about two years of work on this topic by the authors. It contained our entire operator-theoretic approach to wavelet theory, and was\ncompleted in December 1994. This work, while theoretical, had much handson experimentation in its development, and resulted in certain theorems we\nwere able to prove concerning constructions of new families of wavelets. In\norder to conduct successful experiments with our operator techniques, we\nneeded a supply of easily computable test wavelets: that is, wavelets which\nwere very amenable to paper and pencil computations. We discovered that\ncertain sets, we called wavelet sets, existed in abundance, and we computed\nmany concrete examples of them along the way toward proving our results\nof [11]. Several of these were given as examples in [11, Example 4.5, items\n(i) \u2192 (xi)]. Some of these are given in Section 2.6.1 of the present article.\nMost of our work in [11] on the local commutant and the theory of\nwavelet sets was accomplished in the two-month period July-September\n1992. The first time Dai and I used the terms wavelet set and local commutant, as well as the first time we discussed what we referred to as the\nconnectedness problem for wavelets, was in a talk in a Special Session on\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\n4\n\nlarson-chapter\n\nLarson\n\nOperator Algebras in the October 1992 AMS Sectional Meeting in Dayton.\nAlong the way a graduate student at A&M, Darrin Speegle, who was\nenrolled in a seminar course of Larson on the manuscript of [11], answered\nan open question Larson gave out in class by proving that the set of all\nwavelet sets for a given wavelet system is connected in the symmetric difference metric on the class of measurable sets of finite measure. That resulted\nin a paper [50] which became part of his thesis (which was directed by\nWilliam Johnson of Texas A&M), and Speegle subsequently joined forces\nwith Dai and Larson [12] to prove that wavelet sets (and indeed, wavelets)\nexist in much greater generality than the prevailing folklore dictated. We\nreceived some attention for our work, and especially we thank Guido Weiss\nand John Benedetto for recognizing our work. This led to a flurry of papers\nby a number of authors, notably [4, 6, 13], and also led to the paper [52]\nby the Wutam Consortium, which was a group led by Guido Weiss and\nLarson, consisting of 14 researchers\u2013students and postdocs of Weiss and\nLarson\u2013based at Washington University and Texas A&M University, for\nthe purpose of doing basic research on wavelet theory.\n1.2.1. Interpolation\nThe main point of the operator-theoretic interpolation of wavelets (and\nframes) that Dai and I developed is that new wavelets can be obtained as\nlinear combinations of known ones using coefficients which are not necessarily scalars but can be taken to be operators (in fact, Fourier multipliers)\nin a certain class. The ideas involved in this, and the essential computations, all extend naturally to more general unitary systems and wandering\nvectors, and I think that much of the theory is best-put in this abstract setting because clarity is enhanced, and because many of the methods work\nfor more involved systems that are important to applied harmonic analysis,\nsuch as Gabor and generalized Gabor systems, and various types of frame\nunitary systems.\n1.2.2. Some Basic Terminology\nThis article will concern bounded linear operators on separable Hilbert\nspaces. The set of all bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space H will be\ndenoted by B(H). By a bilateral shift U on H we mean a unitary operator U\nfor which there exists a closed linear subspace E \u2282 H with the property that\nthe family of subspaces {U n E : n \u2208 Z} are orthogonal and give a directsum decomposition of H. The subspace E is called a complete wandering\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\nWavelet Sets and Operator-Theoretic Interpolation\n\nlarson-chapter\n\n5\n\nsubspace for U . The multiplicity of U is defined to be the dimension of E.\nThe strong operator topology on B(H is the topology of pointwise convergence, and the weak operator topology is the weakest topology such that\nthe vector functionals \u03c9x,y on B(H) defined by A 7\u2192 hAx, yi, A \u2208 B(H),\nx, y \u2208 H, are all continuous. An algebra of operators is a linear subspace\nof B(H) which is closed under multiplication. An operator algebra is an\nalgebra of operators which is norm-closed. A subset S \u2282 B(H) is called\nselfadjoint if whenever A \u2208 S then also A\u2217 \u2208 S. A C \u2217 -algebra is a selfadjoint operator algebra. A von Neumann algebra is a C \u2217 -algebra which is\nclosed in the weak operator topology. For a unital operator algebra, it is\nwell known that being closed in the weak operator topology is equivalent\nto being closed in the closed in the strong operator topology.\nThe commutant of a set S of operators in B(H) is the family of all\noperators in B(H) that commute with every operator in S. It is closed\nunder addition and multiplication, so is an algebra. And it is clearly closed\nin both the weak operator topology and the strong operator topology. We\nuse the standard prime notation for the commutant. So the commutant of\na subset S \u2282 B(H) is denoted: S \u2032 := {A \u2208 B(H) : AS = SA, S \u2208 S}.\nThe commutant of a selfadjoint set of operators is clearly a von Neumann algebra. Moreover, by a famous theorem of Fuglede every operator\nwhich commutes with a normal operator N also commutes with its adjoint\nN \u2217 , and hence the commutant of any set of normal operators is also a von\nNeumann algebra. So, of particular relevance to this work, the commutant\nof any set of unitary operators is a von Neumann algebra.\nOne of the main tools in this work is the local commutant of a system\nof unitary operators. (See section 2.4.) This is a natural generalization of\nthe commutant of the system, and like the commutant it is a linear space\nof operators which is closed in the weak and the strong operator topologies,\nbut unlike the commutant it is usually not selfadjoint, and is usually not\nclosed under multiplication. It contains the commutant of the system, but\ncan be much larger than the commutant. The local commutant of a wavelet\nunitary system captures all the information about the wavelet system in an\nessential way, and this gives the flavor of our approach to the subject.\nIf U is a unitary operator and A is an operator algebra, then U is said\nto normalize A if U \u22c6 *A*U = A . In the most interesting cases of operatortheoretic interpolation: that is, those cases that yield the strongest structural results, the relevant unitaries in the local commutant of the system\nnormalize the commutant of the system.\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\n6\n\nlarson-chapter\n\nLarson\n\n1.2.3. Acknowledgements\nI want to take the opportunity to thank the organizers of this wonderful\nworkshop at the National University of Singapore for their splendid hospitality and great organization, and for inviting me to give the series of\ntutorial-style talks that resulted in this write-up. I also want to state that\nthe work discussed in this article was supported by grants from the United\nStates National Science Foundation.\n2. Unitary Systems and Wavelet Sets\nWe define a unitary system to be simply a collection of unitary operators\nU acting on a Hilbert space H which contains the identity operator. The\ninteresting unitary systems all have additional structural properties of various types. We will say that a vector \u03c8 \u2208 H is wandering for U if the set\nU\u03c8 := {U \u03c8 : U \u2208 U}\n\n(1)\n\nis an orthonormal set, and we will call \u03c8 a complete wandering vector for\nU if U\u03c8 spans H. This (abstract) point of view can be useful. Write\nW(U)\nfor the set of complete wandering vectors for U.\n2.1. The One-Dimensional Wavelet System\nFor simplicity of presentation, much of the work in this article will deal\nwith one-dimensional wavelets, and in particular, the dyadic case. The other\ncases: non-dyadic and in higher dimensions, are well-described in the literature and are at least notationally more complicated.\n2.1.1. Dyadic Wavelets\nA dyadic orthonormal wavelet in one dimension is a unit vector \u03c8 \u2208\nL2 (R, \u03bc), with \u03bc Lebesgue measure, with the property that the set\nn\n\n{2 2 \u03c8(2n t \u2212 l) : n, l \u2208 Z}\n\n(2)\n\nof all integral translates of \u03c8 followed by dilations by arbitrary integral\npowers of 2, is an orthonormal basis for L2 (R, \u03bc). The term dyadic refers\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\nWavelet Sets and Operator-Theoretic Interpolation\n\nlarson-chapter\n\n7\n\nto the dilation factor \"2\". The term mother wavelet is also used in the\nliterature for \u03c8. Then the functions\nn\n\n\u03c8n,l := 2 2 \u03c8(2n t \u2212 l)\nare called elements of the wavelet basis generated by the \"mother\". The\nfunctions \u03c8n,l will not themselves be mother wavelets unless n = 0.\nLet T and D be the translation (by 1) and dilation (by 2)\u221aunitary\noperators in B(L2 (R) given by (T f )(t) = f (t \u2212 1) and (Df )(t) = 2f (2t).\nThen\nn\n\n2 2 \u03c8(2n t \u2212 l) = (Dn T l \u03c8)(t)\nfor all n, l \u2208 Z. Operator-theoretically, the operators T, D are bilateral shifts\nof infinite multiplicity. It is obvious that L2 ([0, 1]), considered as a subspace\nof L2 (R), is a complete wandering subspace for T , and that L2 ([\u22122, \u22121] \u222a\n[1, 2]) is a complete wandering subspace for D.\n2.1.2. The Dyadic Unitary System\nLet UD,T be the unitary system defined by\n\nUD,T = {Dn T l : n, l \u2208 Z}\n\n(3)\n\nwhere D and T are the operators defined above. Then \u03c8 is a dyadic orthonormal wavelet if and only if \u03c8 is a complete wandering vector for the\nunitary system UD,T . This was our original motivation for developing the\nabstract unitary system theory. Write\nW(D, T ) := W(UD,T )\n\n(4)\n\nto denote the set of all dyadic orthonormal wavelets in one dimension.\nAn abstract interpretation is that, since D is a bilateral shift it has\n(many) complete wandering subspaces, and a wavelet for the system is a\nvector \u03c8 whose translation space (that is, the closed linear span of {T k :\nk \u2208 Z} is a complete wandering subspace for D. Hence \u03c8 must generate\nan orthonormal basis for the entire Hilbert space under the action of the\nunitary system.\n2.1.3. Non-Dyadic Wavelets in One Dimension\nIn one dimension, there are non-dyadic orthonormal wavelets: i.e. wavelets\nfor all possible dilation factors besides 2 (the dyadic case). We said \"possible\", because the scales {0, 1, \u22121} are excluded as scales because the dilation\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\n8\n\nlarson-chapter\n\nLarson\n\noperators they would introduce are not bilateral shifts. All other real numbers for scales yield wavelet theories. In [11, Example 4.5 (x)] a family of\nexamples is given of three-interval wavelet sets (and hence wavelets) for all\nscales d \u2265 2, and it was noted there that such a family also exists for dilation factors 1 < d \u2264 2. There is some recent (yet unpublished) work that\nhas been done, by REU students and mentors, building on this, classifying\nfinite-interval wavelet sets for all possible real (positive and negative scale\nfactors). I mentioned this work, in passing, in my talk.\n2.2. N dimensions\n2.2.1. The Expansive-Dilation Case\nLet 1 \u2264 m < \u221e, and let A be an n \u00d7 n real matrix which is expansive\n(equivalently, all (complex) eigenvalues have modulus > 1). By a dilation A regular-translation orthonormal wavelet we mean a function \u03c8 \u2208 L2 (Rn )\nsuch that\nn\n\n{|det(A)| 2 \u03c8(An t \u2212 (l1 , l2 , ..., ln )t : n, l \u2208 Z}\n\n(5)\n\nwhere t = (t1 , ..., tn )t , is an orthonormal basis for L2 (Rn ; m). (Here m is\nproduct Lebesgue measure, and the superscript \"t\" means transpose.)\nIf A \u2208 Mn (R) is invertible (so in particular if A is expansive), then it is\nvery easy to verify that the operator defined by\n1\n\n2\n\nn\n\n(DA f )(t) = |detA| 2 f (At)\n\n(6)\n\nk l1\n{DA\nT1 * * * Tnln \u03c8 : k, li \u2208 Z}\n\n(7)\n\nn\n\nfor f \u2208 L (R ), t \u2208 R , is unitary. For 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, let Ti be the unitary\noperator determined by translation by 1 in the ith coordinate direction.\nThe set (5) above is then\nIf the dilation matrix A is expansive, but the translations are along\nsome oblique lattice, then there is an invertible real n \u00d7 n matrix T such\nthat conjugation with DT takes the entire wavelet system to a regulartranslation expansive-dilation matrix. This is easily worked out, and was\nshown in detail in [39] in the context of working out a complete theory\nof unitary equivalence of wavelet systems. Hence the wavelet theories are\nequivalent.\n2.2.2. The Non-Expansive Dilation Case\nMuch work has been accomplished concerning the existance of wavelets for\ndilation matrices A which are not expansive. Some of the original work was\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\nWavelet Sets and Operator-Theoretic Interpolation\n\nlarson-chapter\n\n9\n\naccomplished in the Ph.D. theses of Q. Gu and D. Speegle, when they were\ntogether finishing up at Texas A&M. Some significant additional work was\naccomplished by Speegle in [49], and also by others. In [39], with Ionascu\nand Pearcy we proved that if an nxn real invertible matrix A is not similar\n(in the nxn complex matrices) to a unitary matrix, then the corresponding dilation operator DA is in fact a bilateral shift of infinite multiplicity.\nIf a dilation matrix were to admit any type of wavelet (or frame-wavelet)\ntheory, then it is well-known that a necessary condition would be that the\ncorresponding dilation operator would have to be a bilateral shift of infinite\nmultiplicity. I am happy to report that in very recent work [45], with E.\nSchulz, D. Speegle, and K. Taylor, we have succeeded in showing that this\nminimal condition is in fact sufficient: such a matrix, with regular translation lattice, admits a (perhaps infinite) tuple of functions, which collectively\ngenerates a frame-wavelet under the action of this unitary system.\n2.3. Abstract Systems\n2.3.1. Restrictions on Wandering Vectors\nWe note that most unitary systems U do not have complete wandering\nvectors. For W(U) to be nonempty, the set U must be very special. It must\nbe countable if it acts separably (i.e. on a separable Hilbert space), and it\nmust be discrete in the strong operator topology because if U, V \u2208 U and\nif x is a wandering vector for U then\n\u221a\nkU \u2212 V k \u2265 kU x \u2212 V xk = 2\nCertain other properties are forced on U by the presence of a wandering\nvector. One purpose of [11] was to study such properties. Indeed, it was a\nmatter of some surprise to us to discover that such a theory is viable even\nin some considerable generality. For perspective, it is useful to note that\nwhile UD,T has complete wandering vectors, the reversed system\nUT,D = {T l Dn : n, l \u2208 Z}\n\nfails to have a complete wandering vector. (A proof of this was given in the\nintroduction to [11].)\n2.3.2. Group Systems\nAn example which is important to the theory is the following: let G be an\narbitrary countable group, and let H = l2 (G). Let \u03c0 be the (left) regular representation of G on H. Then every element of G gives a complete\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\n10\n\nlarson-chapter\n\nLarson\n\nwandering vector for the unitary system\nU := \u03c0(G).\n\n(If h \u2208 G it is clear that the vector \u03bbh \u2208 l2 (G), which is defined to have 1 in\nthe h position and 0 elsewhere, is in W(U).) If a unitary system is a group,\nand if it has a complete wandering vector, it is not hard to show that it is\nunitarily equivalent to this example.\n2.4. The Local Commutant\n2.4.1. The Local Commutant of the System UD,T\nComputational aspects of operator theory can be introduced into the\nwavelet framework in an elementary way. Here is the way we originally\ndid it: Fix a wavelet \u03c8 and consider the set of all operators S \u2208 B(L2 (R))\nwhich commute with the action of dilation and translation on \u03c8. That is,\nrequire\n(S\u03c8)(2n t \u2212 l) = S(\u03c8(2n t \u2212 l))\n\n(8)\n\nDn T l S\u03c8 = SDn T l \u03c8\n\n(9)\n\nor equivalently\n\nfor all n, l \u2208 Z. Call this the local commutant of the wavelet system UD,T\nat the vector \u03c8. (In our first preliminary writings and talks we called it\nthe point commutant of the system . Formally, the local commutant of the\ndyadic wavelet system on L2 (R) is:\nC\u03c8 (UD,T ) := {S \u2208 B(L2 (R)) : (SDn T l \u2212 Dn T l S)\u03c8 = 0, \u2200n, l \u2208 Z}\n\n(10)\n\nThis is a linear subspace of B(H) which is closed in the strong operator\ntopology, and in the weak operator topology, and it clearly contains the\ncommutant of {D, T }.\nA motivating example is that if \u03b7 is any other wavelet, let V := V\u03c8\u03b7 be\nthe unitary (we call it the interpolation unitary) that takes the basis \u03c8n,l\nto the basis \u03b7n,l . That is, V \u03c8n,l = \u03b7n,l for all n, l \u2208 Z. Then \u03b7 = V \u03c8, so\nV Dn T l \u03c8 = Dn T l S\u03c8 hence V \u2208 C\u03c8 (UD,T ).\nIn the case of a pair of complete wandering vectors \u03c8, \u03b7 for a general\nunitary system U, we will use the same notation V\u03c8\u03b7 for the unitary that\ntakes the vector U \u03c8 to U \u03b7 for all U \u2208 U.\nThis simple-minded idea is reversible, so for every unitary V in C\u03c8 (UD,T )\nthe vector V \u03c8 is a wavelet. This correspondence between unitaries in\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\nlarson-chapter\n\nWavelet Sets and Operator-Theoretic Interpolation\n\n11\n\nC\u03c8 (D, T ) and dyadic orthonormal wavelets is one-to-one and onto (see\nProposition 1.) This turns out to be useful, because it leads to some new\nformulas relating to decomposition and factorization results for wavelets,\nmaking use of the linear and multiplicative properties of C\u03c8 (D, T ).\nIt turns out (a proof is required) that the entire local commutant of the\nsystem UD,T at a wavelet \u03c8 is not closed under multiplication, but it also\nturns out (also via a proof) that for most (and perhaps all ) wavelets \u03c8 the\nlocal commutant at \u03c8 contains many noncommutative operator algebras (in\nfact von Neumann algebras) as subsets, and their unitary groups parameterize norm-arcwise-connected families of wavelets. Moreover, C\u03c8 (D, T ) is\nclosed under left multiplication by the commutant {D, T }\u2032, which turns\nout to be an abelian nonatomic von Neumann algebra. The fact that\nC\u03c8 (D, T ) is a left module under {D, T }\u2032 leads to a method of obtaining\nnew wavelets from old, and of obtaining connectedness results for wavelets,\nwhich we called operator-theoretic interpolation of wavelets in [DL], (or\nsimply operator-interpolation).\n2.4.2. The Local Commutant of an Abstract Unitary System\nMore generally, let S \u2282 B(H) be a set of operators, where H is a separable\nHilbert space, and let x \u2208 H be a nonzero vector, and formally define the\nlocal commutant of S at x by\nCx (S) := {A \u2208 B(H) : (AS \u2212 SA)x = 0, S \u2208 S}\nAs in the wavelet case, this is a weakly and strongly closed linear subspace of B(H) which contains the commutant S \u2032 of S. If x is cyclic for S in\nthe sense that span(Sx) is dense in H, then x separates Cx (S) in the sense\nthat for S \u2208 Cx (S), we have Sx = 0 iff x = 0. Indeed, if A \u2208 Cx (S) and if\nAx = 0, then for any S \u2208 S we have ASx = SAx = 0, so ASx = 0, and\nhence A = 0.\nIf A \u2208 Cx (S) and B \u2208 S \u2032 , let C = BA. Then for all S \u2208 S,\n(CS \u2212 SC)x = B(AS)x \u2212 (SB)Ax = B(SA)x \u2212 (BS)Ax = 0\nbecause ASx = SAx since A \u2208 Cx (S), and SB = BS since B \u2208 S \u2032 . Hence\nCx (S) is closed under left multiplication by operators in S \u2032 . That is, Cx (S\nis a left module over S \u2032 .\nIt is interesting that, if in addition S is a multiplicative semigroup,\nthen in fact Cx (S) is identical with the commutant S \u2032 so in this case the\ncommutant is not a new structure. To see this, suppose A \u2208 Cx (S). Then\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n16:22\n\n12\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\nlarson-chapter\n\nLarson\n\nfor each S, T \u2208 S we have ST \u2208 S, and so\nAS(T x) = (ST )Ax = S(AT x) = (S)T x\nSo since T \u2208 S was arbitrary and span(Sx) = H, it follows that AS = SA.\nProposition 1: If U is any unitary system for which W(U) 6= \u2205, then for\nany \u03c8 \u2208 W(U)\nW(U) = {U \u03c8 : U is a unitary operator in C\u03c8 (U)}\nand the correspondence U \u2192 U \u03c8 is one-to-one.\nA Riesz basis for a Hilbert space H is the image under a bounded\ninvertible operator of an orthonormal basis. Proposition 1 generalizes to\ngenerators of Riesz bases. A Riesz vector for a unitary system U is defined\nto be a vector \u03c8 for which U\u03c8 := {U \u03c8 : U \u2208 U} is a Riesz basis for the\nclosed linear span of U\u03c8, and it is called complete if span U\u03c8 = H. Let\nRW(U) denote the set of all complete Riesz vectors for U.\nProposition 2: Let U be a unitary system on a Hilbert space H. If \u03c8 is a\ncomplete Riesz vector for U , then\nRW(U) = {A\u03c8 : A is an operator in C\u03c8 (U) that is invertible in B(H)}.\n2.4.3. Operator-Theoretic Interpolation\nNow suppose U is a unitary system, such as UD,T , and suppose\n{\u03c81 , \u03c82 , . . . , \u03c8m } \u2282 W(U). (In the case of UD,T , this means that\n(\u03c81 , \u03c82 , . . . , \u03c8n ) is an n-tuple of wavelets.\nLet (A1 , A2 , . . . , An ) be an n-tuple of operators in the commutant U \u2032 of\nU, and let \u03b7 be the vector\n\u03b7 := A1 \u03c81 + A2 \u03c82 + * * * + An \u03c8n .\nThen\n\u03b7 = A1 \u03c81 + A2 V\u03c8\u03c812 \u03c81 + . . . An V\u03c8\u03c81n \u03c81\n\n= (A1 + A2 V\u03c8\u03c812 + * * * + An V\u03c8\u03c81n )\u03c81 .\n\n(11)\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\nlarson-chapter\n\nWavelet Sets and Operator-Theoretic Interpolation\n\n13\n\nWe say that \u03b7 is obtained by operator interpolation from\n{\u03c81 , \u03c82 , . . . , \u03c8m }. Since C\u03c81 (U) is a left U \u2032 - module, it follows that the\noperator\nA := A1 + A2 V\u03c8\u03c812 + . . . An V\u03c8\u03c81n\n\n(12)\n\nis an element of C\u03c81 (U). Moreover, if B is another element of C\u03c81 (U) such\nthat \u03b7 = B\u03c81 , then A \u2212 B \u2208 C\u03c81 (U) and (A \u2212 B)\u03c81 = 0. So since \u03c81\nseparates C\u03c81 (U) it follows that A = B. Thus A is the unique element of\nC\u03c81 (U) that takes \u03c81 to \u03b7.

From\nthe above discussion, it follows that for every vector \u03b7 \u2208 M\u03c81 ,\u03c82 ,...,\u03c8n there\nexists a unique operator A \u2208 C\u03c81 (U) such that \u03b7 = A\u03c81 , and moreover this\nA is an element of S\u03c81 ,...,\u03c8n .\n2.4.4. Normalizing the Commutant\nIn certain essential cases (and we are not sure how general this type of\ncase is) one can prove that an interpolation unitary V\u03c8\u03b7 normalizes the\ncommutant U \u2032 of the system in the sense that V\u03b7\u03c8 U \u2032 V\u03c8\u03b7 = U \u2032 . (Here, it is\neasily seen that (V\u03c8\u03b7 )\u2217 = V\u03b7\u03c8 .) Write V := V\u03c8\u03b7 . If V normalizes U \u2032 , then the\nalgebra, before norm closure, generated by U \u2032 and V is the set of all finite\nP\nsums (trig polynomials) of the form\nAn V n , with coefficients An \u2208 U \u2032 ,\nn \u2208 Z. The closure in the strong operator topology is a von Neumann\nalgebra. Now suppose further that every power of V is contained in C\u03c8 (U).\nThis occurs only in special cases, yet it occurs frequently enough to yield\nsome general methods. Then since C\u03c8 (U) is a SOT-closed linear subspace\nwhich is closed under left multiplication by U \u2032 , this von Neumann algebra\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n14\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\nlarson-chapter\n\nLarson\n\nis contained in C\u03c8 (U), so its unitary group parameterizes a norm-pathconnected subset of W(U) that contains \u03c8 and \u03b7 via the correspondence\nU \u2192 U \u03c8.\nIn the special case of wavelets, this is the basis for the work that Dai\nand I did in [11, Chapter 5] on operator-theoretic interpolation of wavelets.\nIn fact, we specialized there and reserved the term operator-theoretic interpolation to refer explicitely to the case when the interpolation unitaries\nnormalize the commutant. In some subsequent work, we loosened this restriction yielding our more general definition given in this article, because\nthere are cases of interest in which we weren't able to prove normalization.\nHowever, it turns out that if \u03c8 and \u03b7 are s-elementary wavelets (see section\n2.5.4), then indeed V\u03c8\u03b7 normalizes {D, T }\u2032 . (See Proposition 14.) Moreover,\nV\u03c8\u03b7 has a very special form: after conjugating with the Fourier transform,\nit is a composition operator with symbol a natural and very computable\nmeasure-preserving transformation of R. In fact, it is precisely this special\nform for V\u03c8\u03b7 that allows us to make the computation that it normalizes\n{D, T }\u2032. On the other hand, we know of no pair (\u03c8, \u03b7) of wavelets for which\nV\u03c8\u03b7 fails to normalize {D, T }\u2032 . The difficulty is simply that in general it is\nvery hard to do the computations.\nProblem: If {\u03c8, \u03b7} is a pair of dyadic orthonormal wavelets, does the\ninterpolation unitary V\u03c8\u03b7 normalize {D, T }\u2032 ? As mentioned above, the answer is yes if \u03c8 and \u03b7 are s-elementary wavelets.\n2.4.5. An Elementary Interpolation Result\nThe following result is the most elementary case of operator-theoretic interpolation.\nProposition 3: Let U be a unitary system on a Hilbert space H. If \u03c81 and\n\u03c82 are in W(U), then\n\u03c81 + \u03bb\u03c82 \u2208 RW(U)\nfor all complex scalars \u03bb with |\u03bb| 6= 1. More generally, if \u03c81 and \u03c82 are in\nRW(U ) then there are positive constants b > a > 0 such that \u03c81 + \u03bb\u03c82 \u2208\nRW(U) for all \u03bb \u2208 C with either |\u03bb| < a or with |\u03bb| > b.\nProof: If \u03c81 , \u03c82 \u2208 W(U), let V be the unique unitary in C\u03c82 (U) given by\nProposition 1 such that V \u03c82 = \u03c81 . Then\n\u03c81 + \u03bb\u03c82 = (V + \u03bbI)\u03c82 .\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\nWavelet Sets and Operator-Theoretic Interpolation\n\nlarson-chapter\n\n15\n\nSince V is unitary, (V + \u03bbI) is an invertible element of C\u03c82 (U) if |\u03bb| 6= 1,\nso the first conclusion follows from Proposition 2. Now assume \u03c81 , \u03c82 \u2208\nRW(U). Let A be the unique invertible element of C\u03c82 (U) such that A\u03c82 =\n\u03c81 , and write \u03c81 + \u03bb\u03c82 = (A + \u03bbI)\u03c82 . Since A is bounded and invertible\nthere are b > a > 0 such that\n\u03c3(A) \u2286 {z \u2208 C : a < |z| < b}\nwhere \u03c3(A) denotes the spectrum of A , and the same argument applies.\n\n2.4.6. Interpolation Pairs of Wandering Vectors\nIn some cases where a pair \u03c8, \u03b7 of vectors in W(U) are given it turns out\nthat the unitary V in C\u03c8 (U) with V \u03c8 = \u03b7 happens to be a symmetry (i.e.\nV 2 = I). Such pairs are called interpolation pairs of wandering vectors, and\nin the case where U is a wavelet system, they are called interpolation pairs\nof wavelets. Interpolation pairs are more prevalent in the theory, and in\nparticular the wavelet theory, than one might expect. In this case (and in\nmore complex generalizations of this) certain linear combinations of complete wandering vectors are themselves complete wandering vectors \u2013 not\nsimply complete Riesz vectors.\nProposition 4: Let U be a unitary system, let \u03c8, \u03b7 \u2208 W(U), and let V be\nthe unique operator in C\u03c8 (U) with V \u03c8 = \u03b7. Suppose\nV 2 = I.\nThen\ncos \u03b1 * \u03c8 + i sin \u03b1 * \u03b7 \u2208 W(U)\nfor all 0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 2\u03c0.\nThe above result can be thought of as the prototype of our operatortheoretic interpolation results. It is the second most elementary case. More\ngenerally, the scalar \u03b1 in Proposition 4 can be replaced with an appropriate\nself-adjoint operator in the commutant of U. In the wavelet case, after\nconjugating with the Fourier transform, which is a unitary operator, this\nmeans that \u03b1 can be replaced with a wide class of nonnegative dilationperiodic (see definition below) bounded measurable functions on R.\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\n16\n\nlarson-chapter\n\nLarson\n\n2.4.7. A Test For Interpolation Pairs\nThe following converse to Proposition 4 is typical of the type of computations encountered in some wandering vector proofs.\nProposition 5: Let U be a unitary system, let \u03c8, \u03b7 \u2208 W(U), and let V be\nthe unique unitary in C\u03c8 (U) with V \u03c8 = \u03b7. Suppose for some 0 < \u03b1 < \u03c02\nthe vector\n\u03c1 := cos \u03b1 * \u03c8 + i sin \u03b1 * \u03b7\nis contained in W(U). Then\nV 2 = I.\nProof: Since U\u03c8 is a basis it will be enough to show that V U1 \u03c8 = V \u22c6 U1 \u03c8\nfor all U1 \u2208 U. So it will suffice to prove that for all U1 , U2 \u2208 U we have\nhV U1 \u03c8, U2 \u03c8i = hV \u22c6 U1 \u03c8, U2 \u03c8i.\nUsing the fact that V locally commutes with U at \u03c8 we have\nhV U1 \u03c8, U2 \u03c8i = hU1 V \u03c8, U2 \u03c8i = hU1 \u03b7, U2 \u03c8i\n\nand\n\nhV \u22c6 U1 \u03c8, U2 \u03c8i = hU1 \u03c8, V U2 \u03c8i = hU1 \u03c8, U2 V \u03c8i = hU1 \u03c8, U2 \u03b7i.\nSo we must show that hU1 \u03b7, U2 \u03c8i = hU1 \u03c8, U2 \u03b7i for all U1 , U2 \u2208 U.\nWrite \u03c1 := \u03c1\u03b1 . By hypothesis \u03c8, \u03b7 and \u03c1 are unit vectors. So compute\n1 = h\u03c1, \u03c1i = cos2 \u03b1 * h\u03c8, \u03c8i + i sin \u03b1 cos \u03b1 * h\u03b7, \u03c8i\n-\n\ni sin \u03b1 cos \u03b1 * h\u03c8, \u03b7i + sin2 \u03b1 * h\u03b7, \u03b7i\n\n= 1 + i sin \u03b1 cos \u03b1 * (h\u03b7, \u03c8i - h\u03c8, \u03b7i).\nThus, since sin \u03b1 cos \u03b1 6= 0, we must have h\u03b7, \u03c8i = h\u03c8, \u03b7i. Also, for\nU1 , U2 \u2208 U with U1 6= U2 we have\n0 = hU1 \u03c1, U2 \u03c1i = cos2 \u03b1 * hU1 \u03c8, U2 \u03c8i + i sin \u03b1 cos \u03b1 * hU1 \u03b7, U2 \u03c8i\n- i sin \u03b1 cos \u03b1 * hU1 \u03c8, U2 \u03b7i + sin2 \u03b1 * hU1 \u03b7, U2 \u03b7i\n= i sin \u03b1 cos \u03b1 * (hU1 \u03b7, U2 \u03c8i - hU1 \u03c8, U2 \u03b7i),\nwhich implies hU1 \u03b7, U2 \u03c8i = hU1 \u03c8, U2 \u03b7i as required.\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\nWavelet Sets and Operator-Theoretic Interpolation\n\nlarson-chapter\n\n17\n\nThe above result gives an experimental method of checking whether\nV = I for a given pair \u03c8, \u03b7 \u2208 W(U). One just checks whether\n2\n\ni\n1\n\u03c1 := \u221a \u03c8 + \u221a \u03b7\n2\n2\n\nis an element of W(U), which is much simpler than attempting to work\nwith the infinite matrix of V with respect to the basis U\u03c8 (or some other\nbasis for H).\n2.4.8. Connectedness\nIf we consider again the example of the left regular representation \u03c0 of a\ngroup G on H := l2 (G), then the local commutant of U := \u03c0(G) at a vector\n\u03c8 \u2208 W(\u03c0(G)) is just the commutant of \u03c0(G). So since the unitary group\nof the von Neumann algebra (\u03c0(G))\u2032 is norm-arcwise-connected, it follows\nthat W(\u03c0(G)) is norm-arcwise-connected.\nProblem A in [11] asked whether W(D, L) is norm-arcwise-connected. It\nturned out that this conjecture was also formulated independently by Guido\nWeiss ([38], [37]) from a harmonic analysis point of view (our point of view\nwas purely functional analysis), and this problem (and related problems)\nwas the primary stimulation for the creation for the creation of the WUTAM\nCONSORTIUM \u2013 a team of 14 researchers based at Washington University\nand Texas A&M University. (See [52].)\nThis connectedness conjecture was answered yes in [52] for the special\ncase of the family of dyadic orthonormal MRA wavelets in L2 (R), but still\nremains open for the family of arbitrary dyadic orthonormal wavelets in\nL2 (R).\nIn the wavelet case UD,T , if \u03c8 \u2208 W(D, T ) then it turns out that\nC\u03c8 (UD,T ) is in fact much larger than (UD,T )\u2032 = {D, T }\u2032 , underscoring\nthe fact that UD,T is NOT a group. In particular, {D, T }\u2032 is abelian while\nC\u03c8 (D, T ) is nonabelian for every wavelet \u03c8. (The proof of these facts are\ncontained in [11].)\n2.5. Wavelet Sets\n2.5.1. The Fourier Transform\nWe will use the following form of the Fourier\u2013Plancherel transform F on\nH = L2 (R), because it is a form normalized so it is a unitary transformation.\nAlthough there is another such normalized form that is frequently used, and\nactually simpler, the present form is the one we used in our original first\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\n18\n\nlarson-chapter\n\nLarson\n\npaper [11] involving operator theory and wavelets, and so we will stick with\nit in these notes to avoid any confusion to a reader of both.\nIf f, g \u2208 L1 (R) \u2229 L2 (R) then\nZ\n1\ne\u2212ist f (t)dt := f\u02c6(s),\n(14)\n(F f )(s) := \u221a\n2\u03c0 R\nand\n1\n(F \u22121 g)(t) = \u221a\n2\u03c0\nWe have\n1\n(F T\u03b1 f )(s) = \u221a\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nR\n\nZ\n\neist g(s)ds.\n\n(15)\n\nR\n\ne\u2212ist f (t \u2212 \u03b1)dt = e\u2212is\u03b1 (F f )(s).\n\nSo F T\u03b1 F \u22121 g = e\u2212is\u03b1 g. For A \u2208 B(H) let \u00c2 denote F AF \u22121 . Thus\nTb\u03b1 = Me\u2212i\u03b1s ,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere for h \u2208 L\u221e we use Mh to denote the multiplication operator f \u2192 hf .\nSince {Me\u2212i\u03b1s : \u03b1 \u2208 R} generates the m.a.s.a.

So let g \u2208 L (R) be arbitrary. Then\n(a.e.) we have\n\u221a\n(Mh Dg)(s) = h(s)( 2 g(2s)), and\n\u221a\n(DMh g)(s) = D(h(s)g(s)) = h(2s)g(2s).\nSince these must be equal a.e. for arbitrary g, we must have h(s) = h(2s)\na.e.\nNow let E = [\u22122, \u22121) \u222a [1, 2), and for n \u2208 Z let En = {2n x : x \u2208 E}.\nObserve that the sets En are disjoint and have union R\\{0}. So if g is\nany uniformly bounded function on E, then g extends uniquely (a.e.) to a\nfunction g\u0303 \u2208 L\u221e (R) satisfying\ng\u0303(s) = g\u0303(2s),\n\ns \u2208 R,\n\nby setting\ng\u0303(2n s) = g(s),\n\ns \u2208 E, n \u2208 Z,\n\nand g\u0303(0) = 0. We have kg\u0303k\u221e = kgk\u221e . Conversely, if h is any function\nsatisfying h(s) = h(2s) a.e., then h is uniquely (a.e.) determined by its\nb Tb}\u2032 is a\nrestriction to E. This 1-1 mapping g \u2192 Mg\u0303 from L\u221e (E) onto {D,\n\u2217-isomorphism.\nWe will refer to a function h satisfying h(s) = h(2s) a.e. as a 2-dilation\nperiodic function. This gives a simple algorithm for computing a large class\nof wavelets from a given one, by simply modifying the phase:\nGiven \u03c8,, let \u03c8b = F (\u03c8), choose a real-valued function h \u2208 L\u221e (E)\n\narbitrarily, let g = exp(ih), extend to a 2-dilation periodic\n\n(18)\n\nb\nfunction g\u0303 as above, and compute \u03c8g\u0303 = F \u22121 (g\u0303\u03c8).\n\nIn the description above, the set E could clearly be replaced with\n[\u22122\u03c0, \u2212\u03c0) \u222a [\u03c0, 2\u03c0), or with any other \"dyadic\" set [\u22122a, a) \u222a [a, 2a) for\nsome a > 0.\n2.5.3. Wavelets of Computationally Elementary Form\nWe now give an account of s-elementary and M SF -wavelets. The two most\nelementary dyadic orthonormal wavelets are the Haar wavelet and Shannon's wavelet (also called the Littlewood\u2013Paley wavelet).\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\n20\n\nlarson-chapter\n\nLarson\n\nThe Haar wavelet is the function\n\uf8f1\n1\n\uf8f2 1, 0 \u2264 t < 2\n1\n\u03c8H (t) = \u22121, 2 \u2264 t \u2264 1\n\uf8f3\n0, otherwise.\n\n(19)\n\nIn this case it is very easy to see that the dilates/translates\nn\n\n{2 2 \u03c8H (2n \u2212 l) : n, l \u2208 Z}\nare orthonormal, and an elementary argument shows that their span is\ndense in L2 (R).\nShannon's wavelet is the L2 (R)-function with Fourier transform \u03c8bS =\n\u221a1 \u03c7E where\n0\n2\u03c0\nE0 = [\u22122\u03c0, \u2212\u03c0) \u222a [\u03c0, 2\u03c0).\n\n(20)\n\nThe argument that \u03c8bS is a wavelet is in a way even more transparent than\nfor the Haar wavelet. And it has the advantage of generalizing nicely. For\na simple argument, start from the fact that the exponents\n{eils : n \u2208 Z}\nrestricted to [0, 2\u03c0] and normalized by \u221a12\u03c0 is an orthonormal basis for\nL2 [0, 2\u03c0]. Write E0 = E\u2212 \u222a E+ where E\u2212 = [\u22122\u03c0, \u2212\u03c0), E+ = [\u03c0, 2\u03c0). Since\n{E\u2212 + 2\u03c0, E+ } is a partition of [0, 2\u03c0) and since the exponentials eils are\ninvariant under translation by 2\u03c0, it follows that\n\u001a ils\n\u001b\ne\n\u221a\n: n\u2208Z\n(21)\n2\u03c0 E0\nis an orthonormal basis for L2 (E0 ). Since Tb = Me\u2212is , this set can be written\n{Tbl\u03c8bs : l \u2208 Z}.\n\n(22)\n\nK = [\u22122a, \u2212a) \u222a [b, 2b)\n\n(23)\n\nNext, note that any \"dyadic interval\" of the form J = [b, 2b), for some b > 0\nhas the property that {2n J : n \u2208 Z}, is a partition of (0, \u221e). Similarly, any\nset of the form\n\nfor a, b > 0, has the property that\n{2n K : n \u2208 Z}\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\nlarson-chapter\n\n21\n\nWavelet Sets and Operator-Theoretic Interpolation\n\nis a partition of R\\{0}. It follows that the space L2 (K), considered as a\nsubspace of\u221a\nL2 (R), is a complete wandering subspace for the dilation unitary\n(Df )(s) = 2 f (2s). For each n \u2208 Z,\nL\n\nn\n\n2\n\nDn (L2 (K)) = L2 (2\u2212n K).\n\n(24)\n2\n\nSo\nn D (L (K)) is a direct sum decomposition of L (R). In particular\nE0 has this property.

It follows that\n{Dn Tbl \u03c8bs : n, l \u2208 Z}\n\nis an orthonormal basis for L2 (R). Hence {Dn T l \u03c8s : n, l \u2208 Z} is an orthonormal basis for L2 (R), as required.\nThe Haar wavelet can be generalized, and in fact Daubechie's wellknown continuous compactly-supported wavelet is a generalization of the\nHaar wavelet. However, known generalization of the Haar wavelet are all\nmore complicated and difficult to work with in hand-computations.\nFor our work, in order to proceed with developing an operator algebraic\ntheory that had a chance of directly impacting concrete function-theoretic\nwavelet theory we needed a large supply of examples of wavelets which\nwere elementary enough to work with. First, we found another \"Shannontype\" wavelet in the literature. This was the Journe wavelet, which we\nfound described on p. 136 in Daubechies book [14]. Its Fourier transform is\n\u03c8bJ = \u221a12\u03c0 \u03c7EJ , where\n\u0014\n\u0013 \u0014\n\u0013\n\u0013 \u0014\n\u0013 \u0014\n32\u03c0\n4\u03c0\n4\u03c0\n32\u03c0\nEJ = \u2212\n\u222a\n.\n, \u22124\u03c0 \u222a \u2212\u03c0, \u2212\n, \u03c0 \u222a 4\u03c0,\n7\n7\n7\n7\n\nThen, thinking the old adage \"where there's smoke there's fire!\", we\npainstakingly worked out many more examples. So far, these are the basic\nbuilding blocks in the concrete part of our theory. By this we mean the part\nof our theory that has had some type of direct impact on function-theoretic\nwavelet theory.\n2.5.4. Definition of Wavelet Set\nWe define a wavelet set to be a measurable subset E of R for which \u221a12\u03c0 \u03c7E\nis the Fourier transform of a wavelet. The wavelet \u03c8bE := \u221a1 \u03c7E is called\ns-elementary in [11].\n\n2\u03c0\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\n22\n\nlarson-chapter\n\nLarson\n\nIt turns out that this class of wavelets was also discovered and systematically explored completely independently, and in about the same time\nperiod, by Guido Weiss (Washington University), his colleague and former student E. Hernandez (U. Madrid), and his students X. Fang and X.\nWang. In [17,37, 38] they are called MSF (minimally supported frequency)\nwavelets. In signal processing, the parameter s, which is the independent\nb is the frequency variable, and the variable t, which is the\nvariable for \u03c8,\nindependent variable for \u03c8, is the time variable. No function with support\na subset of a wavelet set E of strictly smaller measure can be the Fourier\ntransform of a wavelet.\nProblem. Must the support of the Fourier transform of a wavelet contain\na wavelet set? This question is open for dimension 1. It makes sense for any\nfinite dimension.\n2.5.5. The Spectral Set Condition\n\u00bfFrom the argument above describing why Shannon's wavelet is, indeed, a\nwavelet, it is clear that sufficient conditions for E to be a wavelet set are\n(i) the normalized exponential \u221a12\u03c0 eils , l \u2208 Z, when restricted\nto E should constitute an orthonormal basis for L2 (E) (in other\nwords E is a spectral set for the integer lattice Z),\nand\n(ii) The family {2n E : n \u2208 Z} of dilates of E by integral powers of\n2 should constitute a measurable partition (i.e. a partition modulo\nnull sets) of R.\nThese conditions are also necessary. In fact if a set E satisfies (i), then for\nit to be a wavelet set it is obvious that (ii) must be satisfied. To show that\n(i) must be satisfied by a wavelet set E, consider the vectors\nb n \u03c8bE = \u221a1 \u03c72\u2212n E ,\nD\n2\u03c0\n\nn \u2208 Z.\n\nSince \u03c8bE is a wavelet these must be orthogonal, and so the sets\n{2n E : n \u2208 Z} must be disjoint modulo null sets. It follows that\n{ \u221a12\u03c0 eils |E : l \u2208 Z} is not only an orthonormal set of vectors in L2 (E),\nit must also span L2 (E).\nIt is known from the theory of spectral sets (as an elementary special\ncase) that a measurable set E satisfies (i) if and only if it is a generator of a\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\nWavelet Sets and Operator-Theoretic Interpolation\n\nlarson-chapter\n\n23\n\nmeasurable partition of R under translation by 2\u03c0 (i.e. iff {E +2\u03c0n : n \u2208 Z}\nis a measurable partition of R). This result generalizes to spectral sets for\nthe integral lattice in Rn . For this elementary special case a direct proof is\nnot hard.\n2.5.6. Translation and Dilation Congruence\nWe say that measurable sets E, F are translation congruent modulo 2\u03c0 if\nthere is a measurable bijection \u03c6 : E \u2192 F such that \u03c6(s) \u2212 s is an integral\nmultiple of 2\u03c0 for each s \u2208 E; or equivalently, if there is a measurable\npartition {En : n \u2208 Z} of E such that\n{En + 2n\u03c0 : n \u2208 Z}\n\n(26)\n\nis a measurable partition of F . Analogously, define measurable sets G and\nH to be dilation congruent modulo 2 if there is a measurable bijection\n\u03c4 : G \u2192 H such that for each s \u2208 G there is an integer n, depending on\ns, such that \u03c4 (s) = 2n s; or equivalently, if there is a measurable partition\n{Gn }\u221e\n\u2212\u221e of G such that\n{2n G}\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(27)\n\nis a measurable partition of H. (Translation and dilation congruency modulo other positive numbers of course make sense as well.)\nThe following lemma is useful.\nLemma 7: Let f \u2208 L2 (R), and let E = supp(f ). Then f has the property\nthat\n{eins f : n \u2208 Z}\n\nis an orthonormal basis for L2 (E) if and only if\n(i) E is congruent to [0, 2\u03c0) modulo 2\u03c0, and\n(ii) |f (s)| = \u221a12\u03c0 a.e. on E.\nIf E is a measurable set which is 2\u03c0-translation congruent to [0, 2\u03c0),\nthen since\n\u001b\n\u001a ils\ne\n\u221a\n: l\u2208Z\n2\u03c0 [0,2\u03c0)\n\nis an orthonormal basis for L2 [0, 2\u03c0] and the exponentials eils are 2\u03c0invariant, as in the case of Shannon's wavelet it follows that\n\u001a ils\n\u001b\ne\n\u221a\n: l\u2208Z\n2\u03c0 E\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\n24\n\nlarson-chapter\n\nLarson\n\nis an orthonormal basis for L2 (E).

A Criterion\nThe following is a useful criterion for wavelet sets. It was published independently by Dai\u2013Larson in [11] and by Fang\u2013Wang in [17] at about the\nsame time in December, 1994. In fact, it is amusing that the two papers\nhad been submitted within two days of each other; only much later did we\neven learn of each others work and of this incredible timing.\nProposition 9: Let E \u2286 R be a measurable set. Then E is a wavelet set\nif and only if E is both a 2-dilation generator of a partition (modulo null\nsets) of R and a 2\u03c0-translation generator of a partition (modulo null sets)\nof R. Equivalently, E is a wavelet set if and only if E is both translation\ncongruent to [0, 2\u03c0) modulo 2\u03c0 and dilation congruent to [\u22122\u03c0, \u2212\u03c0)\u222a[\u03c0, 2\u03c0)\nmodulo 2.\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\nlarson-chapter\n\nWavelet Sets and Operator-Theoretic Interpolation\n\n25\n\nNote that a set is 2\u03c0-translation congruent to [0, 2\u03c0) iff it is 2\u03c0translation congruent to [\u22122\u03c0, \u03c0) \u222a [\u03c0, 2\u03c0). So the last sentence of Proposition 9 can be stated: A measurable set E is a wavelet set if and only if\nit is both 2\u03c0-translation and 2-dilation congruent to the Littlewood\u2013Paley\nset [\u22122\u03c0, \u2212\u03c0) \u222a [\u03c0, 2\u03c0).\n2.6. Phases\nIf E is a wavelet set, and if f (s) is any function with support E which\nhas constant modulus \u221a12\u03c0 on E, then F \u22121 (f ) is a wavelet. Indeed, by\nLemma 7 {Tbl f : \u2208 Z} is an orthonormal basis for L2 (E), and since the\nb it\nsets 2n E partition R, so L2 (E) is a complete wandering subspace for D,\nn bl\n2\nb\nfollows that {D T f : n, l \u2208 Z} must be an orthonormal basis for L (R), as\n\nrequired. In [17, 37, 38] the term MSF-wavelet includes this type of wavelet.\nSo MSF-wavelets can have arbitrary phase and s-elementary wavelets have\nphase 0. Every phase is attainable in the sense of chapter 3 for an MSF or\ns-elementary wavelet.\n2.6.1. Some Examples of One-Dimensional Wavelet Sets\nIt is usually easy to determine, using the dilation-translation criteria, in\nProposition 9, whether a given finite union of intervals is a wavelet set. In\nfact, to verify that a given \"candidate\" set E is a wavelet set, it is clear\nfrom the above discussion and criteria that it suffices to do two things.\n(1) Show, by appropriate partitioning, that E is 2-dilationcongruent to a set of the form [\u22122a, \u2212a) \u222a [b, 2b) for some a, b > 0.\nand\n(2) Show, by appropriate partitioning, that E is 2\u03c0-translationcongruent to a set of the form [c, c + 2\u03c0) for some real number\nc.\nOn the other hand, wavelet sets suitable for testing hypotheses, can be\nquite difficult to construct. There are very few \"recipes\" for wavelet sets,\nas it were. Many families of such sets have been constructed for reasons\nincluding perspective, experimentation, testing hypotheses, etc., including\nperhaps the pure enjoyment of doing the computations \u2013 which are somewhat \"puzzle-like\" in nature. In working with the theory it is nice (and\nin fact necessary) to have a large supply of wavelets on hand that permit\nrelatively simple analysis.\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n26\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\nlarson-chapter\n\nLarson\n\nFor this reason we take the opportunity here to present for the reader\na collection of such sets, mainly taken from [11], leaving most of the \"fun\"\nin verifying that they are indeed wavelet sets to the reader.\nWe refer the reader to [12] for a proof of the existence of wavelet sets\nin R(n) , and a proof that there are sufficiently many to generate the Borel\nstructure of R(n) . These results are true for arbitrary expansive dilation\nfactors. Some concrete examples in the plane were subsequently obtained by\nSoardi and Weiland, and others were obtained by Gu and Speegle. Two had\nalso been obtained by Dai for inclusion in the revised concluding remarks\nsection of our Memoir [11].\nIn these examples we will usually write intervals as half-open intervals\n[*, ) because it is easier to verify the translation and dilation congruency\nrelations (1) and (2) above when wavelet sets are written thus, even though\nin actuality the relations need only hold modulo null sets.\n(i) As mentioned above, an example due to Journe of a wavelet which\nadmits no multiresolution analysis is the s-elementary wavelet with wavelet\nset\n\u0013 \u0014\n\u0013\n\u0013 \u0014\n\u0013 \u0014\n\u0014\n4\u03c0\n4\u03c0\n32\u03c0\n32\u03c0\n\u222a\n.\n, \u22124\u03c0 \u222a \u2212\u03c0,\n, \u03c0 \u222a 4\u03c0,\n\u2212\n7\n7\n7\n7\nTo see that this satisfies the criteria, label these intervals, in order, as\nJ1 , J2 , J3 , J4 and write J = \u222aJi . Then\n\u0014\n\u0013 \u0014\n\u0013\n32\u03c0 16\u03c0\n16\u03c0 32\u03c0\nJ1 \u222a 4J2 \u222a 4J3 \u222a J4 = \u2212\n\u222a\n.\n,\u2212\n,\n7\n7\n7\n7\nThis has the form [\u22122a, a) \u222a [b, 2b) so is a 2-dilation generator of a partition\nof R\\{0}. Then also observe that\n{J1 + 6\u03c0, J2 + 2\u03c0, J3 , J4 \u2212 4\u03c0}\nis a partition of [0, 2\u03c0).\n(ii) The Shannon (or Littlewood\u2013Paley) set can be generalized. For any\n\u2212\u03c0 < \u03b1 < \u03c0, the set\nE\u03b1 = [\u22122\u03c0 + 2\u03b1, \u2212\u03c0 + \u03b1) \u222a [\u03c0 + \u03b1, 2\u03c0 + 2\u03b1)\nis a wavelet set. Indeed, it is clearly a 2-dilation generator of a partition of\nR\\{0}, and to see that it satisfies the translation congruency criterion for\n\u2212\u03c0 < \u03b1 \u2264 0 (the case 0 < \u03b1 < \u03c0 is analogous) just observe that\n{[\u22122\u03c0 + 2\u03b1, 2\u03c0) + 4\u03c0, [\u22122\u03c0, \u2212\u03c0 + \u03b1) + 2\u03c0, [\u03c0 + \u03b1, 2\u03c0 + 2\u03b1)}\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\nWavelet Sets and Operator-Theoretic Interpolation\n\nlarson-chapter\n\n27\n\nis a partition of [0, 2\u03c0). It is clear that \u03c8E\u03b1 is then a continuous (in L2 (R)norm) path of s-elementary wavelets. Note that\n1\nlim \u03c8bE\u03b1 = \u221a \u03c7[2\u03c0,4\u03c0) .\n\u03b1\u2192\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n\nThis is not the Fourier transform of a wavelet because the set [2\u03c0, 4\u03c0) is\nnot a 2-dilation generator of a partition of R\\{0}. So\nlim \u03c8E\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\u2192\u03c0\n\nis not an orthogonal wavelet. (It is what is known as a Hardy wavelet\nbecause it generates an orthonormal basis for H 2 (R) under dilation and\ntranslation.) This example demonstrates that W(D, T ) is not closed in\nL2 (R).\n(iii) Journe's example above can be extended to a path. For \u2212 \u03c07 \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264\n\u03c0\n7 the set\n\u0013 \u0014\n\u0013\n\u0014\n\u0013 \u0014\n\u0013 \u0014\n4\u03c0\n32\u03c0\n4\u03c0\n4\u03c0\n\u222a\nJ\u03b2 = \u2212\n, \u22124\u03c0 + 4\u03b2 \u222a \u2212\u03c0 + \u03b2, \u2212\n, \u03c0 + \u03b2 \u222a 4\u03c0 + 4\u03b2, 4\u03c0 +\n7\n7\n7\n7\nis a wavelet set. The same argument in (i) establishes dilation congruency.\nFor translation, the argument in (i) shows congruency to [4\u03b2, 2\u03c0+4\u03b2) which\nis in turn congruent to [0, 2\u03c0) as required. Observe that here, as opposed\nto in (ii) above, the limit of \u03c8J\u03b2 as \u03b2 approaches the boundary point \u03c07 is\na wavelet. Its wavelet set is a union of 3 disjoint intervals.\n(iv) Let A \u2286 [\u03c0, 3\u03c0\n2 ) be an arbitrary measurable subset. Then there is\na wavelet set W , such that W \u2229 [\u03c0, 3\u03c0\n2 ) = A. For the construction, let\nB = [2\u03c0, 3\u03c0)\\2A,\nh\n\u03c0\u0011\nC = \u2212\u03c0, \u2212\n\\(A \u2212 2\u03c0)\n2\nand D = 2A \u2212 4\u03c0.\nLet\nW =\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0013\n3\u03c0\n, 2\u03c0 \u222a A \u222a B \u222a C \u222a D.\n2\n\n3\u03c0\nWe have W \u2229 [\u03c0, 3\u03c0\n2 ) = A. Observe that the sets [ 2 , 2\u03c0), A, B, C, D, are\ndisjoint. Also observe that the sets\n\u0013\n\u0014\n1\n3\u03c0\n, 2\u03c0 , A, B, 2C, D,\n2\n2\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n28\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\nlarson-chapter\n\nLarson\n\nare disjoint and have union [\u22122\u03c0, \u2212\u03c0) \u222a [\u03c0, 2\u03c0).

Hence W is a wavelet set.\n(v) Wavelet sets for arbitrary (not necessarily integral) dilation factors\nother then 2 exist.

Then G is d-wavelet set. To see this, note that {A +\n2\u03c0, B, C} is a partition of an interval of length 2\u03c0. So G is 2\u03c0-translationcongruent to [0, 2\u03c0). Also, {A, B, d\u22121 C} is a partition of the set [\u2212d\u03b1, \u2212\u03b1)\u222a\n2\u03c0\n[\u03b2, d\u03b2) for \u03b1 = d22\u03c0\n\u22121 , and \u03b2 = d2 \u22121 , so from this form it follows that\nn\n{d G : n \u2208 Z} is a partition of R\\{0}. Hence if \u03c8 := F \u22121 ( \u221a12\u03c0 \u03c7G ), it\nn\nfollows that {d 2 \u03c8(dn t \u2212 l) : n, l \u2208 Z} is orthonormal basis for L2 (R), as\nrequired.\n2.7. Operator-Theoretic Interpolation of Wavelets: The\nSpecial Case of Wavelet Sets\nLet E, F be a pair of wavelet sets. Then for (a.e.) x \u2208 E there is a unique\ny \u2208 F such that x \u2212 y \u2208 2\u03c0Z. This is the translation congruence property\nof wavelet sets. Also, for (a.e.) x \u2208 E there is a unique z \u2208 F such that xz is\nan integral power of 2. This is the dilation congruence property of wavelet\nsets. (See section 2.5.6.)\nThere is a natural closed-form algorithm for the interpolation unitary\n\u03c8F\nV\u03c8E which maps the wavelet basis for \u03c8bE to the wavelet basis for \u03c8bF .\nIndeed, using both the translation and dilation congruence properties of\n{E, F }, one can explicitly compute a (unique) measure-preserving transF\nformation \u03c3 := \u03c3E\nmapping R onto R which has the property that V\u03c8\u03c8EF is\nidentical with the composition operator defined by:\nf 7\u2192 f \u25e6 \u03c3 \u22121\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\nlarson-chapter\n\nWavelet Sets and Operator-Theoretic Interpolation\n\n29\n\nfor all f \u2208 L2 (R). With this formulation, compositions of the maps \u03c3 between different pairs of wavelet sets are not difficult to compute, and thus\nproducts of the corresponding interpolation unitaries can be computed in\nterms of them.\n2.7.1. The Interpolation Map \u03c3\nLet E and F be arbitrary wavelet sets. Let \u03c3 : E \u2192 F be the 1-1, onto map\nimplementing the 2\u03c0-translation congruence. Since E and F both generated\npartitions of R\\{0} under dilation by powers of 2, we may extend \u03c3 to a\n1-1 map of R onto R by defining \u03c3(0) = 0, and\n\u03c3(s) = 2n \u03c3(2\u2212n s) for s \u2208 2n E,\n\nn \u2208 Z.\n\n(30)\n\nF\nWe adopt the notation \u03c3E\nfor this, and call it the interpolation map for the\nordered pair (E, F ).\nF\nLemma 10: In the above notation, \u03c3E\nis a measure-preserving transformation from R onto R.\nF\nProof: Let \u03c3 := \u03c3E\n. Let \u03a9 \u2286 R be a measurable set. Let \u03a9n = \u03a9 \u2229 2n E,\nn \u220b Z, and let En = 2\u2212n \u03a9n \u2286 E. Then {\u03a9n } is a partition of \u03a9, and\nwe have m(\u03c3(En )) = m(En ) because the restriction of \u03c3 to E is measurepreserving. So\nX\nX\nm(\u03c3(\u03a9)) =\nm(\u03c3(\u03a9n )) =\nm(2n \u03c3(En ))\nn\n\n=\n\nX\n\nn\n\nn\n\n2 m(\u03c3(En )) =\n\nn\n\n=\n\nX\nn\n\nm(2n En ) =\n\nX\n\nX\n\n2n m(En )\n\nn\n\nm(\u03a9n ) = m(\u03a9).\n\nn\n\nA function f : R \u2192 R is called 2-homogeneous if f (2s) = 2f (s) for all\ns \u2208 R. Equivalently, f is 2-homogeneous iff f (2n s) = 2n f (s), s \u2208 R, n \u2208 Z.\nSuch a function is completely determined by its values on any subset of R\nF\nwhich generates a partition of R\\{0} by 2-dilation. So \u03c3E\nis the (unique) 2homogeneous extension of the 2\u03c0-transition congruence E \u2192 F . The set of\nall 2-homogeneous measure-preserving transformations of R clearly forms\na group under composition. Also, the composition of a 2-dilation-periodic\nfunction f with a 2-homogeneous function g is (in either order) 2-dilation\nperiodic. We have f (g(2s)) = f (2g(s)) = f (g(s)) and g(f (2s)) = g(f (s)).\nThese facts will be useful.\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\n30\n\nlarson-chapter\n\nLarson\n\n2.7.2.

Unitary Systems and Frames\nIn [33] we developed an operator-theoretic approach to discrete frame theory (i.e. frame sequences, as opposed to continuous frame transforms) on\na separable Hilbert space. We then applied it to an investigation of frame\nvectors for unitary systems, frame wavelets and group representations. The\nstarting-point idea, which is pretty simple-minded in fact, is to realize any\nframe sequence for a Hilbert space H as a compression of a Riesz basis for\na larger Hilbert space. In other words, a frame is a sequence of vectors in a\nHilbert space which dilates, (in the operator-theoretic or geometric sense,\nas opposed to the function-theoretic sense of multiplication of the independent variable of a function by a dilation constant), or extends, to a (Riesz)\nbasis for a larger space. From this idea much can be developed, and some\nnew perspective can be given to certain concepts that have been used in\nengineering circles for many years. See section 3.2. below.\n3.1. Basics on Frames\nLet H be a separable complex Hilbert space. Let B(H) denote the algebra\nof all bounded linear operators on H. Let N denote the natural numbers,\nand Z the integers. We will use J to denote a generic countable (or finite)\nindex set such as Z, N, Z(2) , N \u222a N etc.\nA sequence {xj : j \u2208 N} of vectors in H is called a frame if there are\nconstants A, B > 0 such that\nX\n|hx, xj i|2 \u2264 Bkxk2\nAkxk2 \u2264\nj\n\nfor all x \u2208 H. The optimal constant (maximal for A and minimal for B)\nare called the f rame bounds. The frame {xj } is called a tight frame if\nA = B, and is called P arseval if A = B = 1. (Originally, in [33] and a in\nnumber of subsequent papers, the term normalized tight frame was used\nfor this. However, this term had also been applied by Benedetto and Ficus\n[5] for another concept: a tight frame of unit vectors; what we now call a\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\nWavelet Sets and Operator-Theoretic Interpolation\n\nlarson-chapter\n\n35\n\nuniform tight frame, or spherical frame. So, after all parties involved, the\nname Parseval was adopted. It makes a lot of sense, because a Parseval\nframe is precisely a frame which satisfies Parseval's identity.) A sequence\n{xj } is defined to be a Riesz basis if it is a frame and is also a basis for H\nin the sense that for each x \u2208 H there is a unique sequence {\u03b1j } in C such\nP\nthat x = \u03b1j xj with the convergence being in norm. We note that a Riesz\nbasis is also defined to be basis which is obtained from an orthonormal basis\nby applying a bounded linear invertible operator. This is equivalent to the\nfirst definition. It should be noted that in Hilbert spaces the Riesz bases\nare precisely the bounded unconditional bases. We will say that frames\n{xj : j \u2208 J} and {yj : j \u2208 J} on Hilbert spaces H, K, respectively, are\nunitarily equivalent if there is a unitary U : H \u2192 K such that U xj = yj\nfor all j \u2208 J. We will say that they are similar (or isomorphic) if there is a\nbounded linear invertible operator T : H \u2192 K such that T xj = yj for all\nj \u2208 J.\nExample 14: Let K = L2 (T) where T is the unit circle and measure is\nnormalized Lebesgue measure, and let {eins : n \u2208 Z} be the standard\northonormal basis for L2 (T). If E \u2286 T is any measurable subset then\n{eins |E : n \u2208 Z} is a Parseval frame for L2 (E). This can be viewed as\nobtained from the single vector \u03c7E by applying all integral powers of the\n(unitary) multiplication operator Meis . It turns out that these are all (for\ndifferent E) unitarily inequivalent. This is an example of a Parseval frame\nwhich is generated by the action of a unitary group on a single vector. This\ncan be compared with the definition of a frame wavelet. (As one might expect, a single function \u03c8 in L2 (R) which generates a frame for L2 (R) under\nthe action of UD,T is called a frame-wavelet.)\n3.2. Dilation of Frames: The Discrete Version of\nNaimark's Theorem\nNow let {xn }n\u2208J be a Parseval frame and let \u03b8 : H \u2192 K := l2 (J) be\nthe usual analysis operator (this was called the frame transform in [HL] )\ndefined by \u03b8(x) := (hx, xn i)n\u2208J . This is obviously an isometry. Let P be the\northogonal projection from K onto \u03b8(H). Denote the standard orthonormal\nbasis for l2 (J) by {ej : j \u2208 J}. For any m \u2208 J, we have\nh\u03b8(xm ), P en i = hP \u03b8(xm ), en i = h\u03b8(xm ), en i\n= hxm , xn i = h\u03b8(xm ), \u03b8(xm )i.\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\n36\n\nlarson-chapter\n\nLarson\n\nIt follows easily that \u03b8(xn ) = P en , n \u2208 J. Identifying H with \u03b8(H), this\nshows indeed that every Parseval frame can be realized by compressing an\northonormal basis, as claimed earlier.\nThis can actually be viewed as a special case (probably the simplest\npossible special case) of an old theorem of Naimark concerning operator\nalgebras and dilation of positive operator valued measures to projection\nvalued measures. The connection between Naimark's theorem and the dilation result for Parseval frames, and that the latter can be viewed as a\nspecial case of the former, was pointed out to me by Chandler Davis and\nDick Kadison in a conference (COSY-1999: The Canadian Operator Algebra Symposium, Prince Edward Island, May 1999).\n\n3.3. Complements of Frames\nIt is useful to note that P will equal I iff {xn } is a basis. Indeed, if P 6= I,\nP\nthen choose z 6= 0, z \u2208 (I \u2212 P )K, and write z = \u03b1n en for some sequence\nP\n\u03b1n \u2208 C. Then 0 = P z =\n\u03b1n \u03b8(xn ), and not all the scalars \u03b1n are zero.\nHence {xn } is not topologically linearly independent so cannot even be a\nSchauder basis. On the other hand if P = I then {xn } is obviously an\northonormal basis.\nSuppose {xn }n\u2208J is a Parseval frame for H, and let \u03b8, P, K, en be as\nabove. Let M = (I \u2212 P )K. Then yn := (I \u2212 P )en is a Parseval frame on\nM which is complementary to {xn } in the sense that the inner direct sum\n{xn \u2295 yn : n \u2208 J} is an orthonormal basis for the direct sum Hilbert space\nH \u2295 M . Moreover there is uniqueness: The extension of a tight frame to an\northonormal basis described in the above paragraph is unique up to unitary\nequivalence. That is if N is another Hilbert space and {zn } is a tight frame\nfor N such that {xn \u2295 zn : n \u2208 J} is an orthonormal basis for H \u2295 N , then\nthere is a unitary transformation U mapping M onto N such that U yn = zn\nfor all n. In particular, dim M = dim N .\nIf {xj } is a Parseval frame, we will call any Parseval frame {zj } such\nthat {xj \u2295 zj } is an orthonormal basis for the direct sum space, a strong\ncomplement to {xj }. So every Parseval frame has a strong complement\nwhich is unique up to unitary equivalence. More generally, if {yj } is a\ngeneral frame we will call any frame {wj } such that {yj \u2295 wj } is a Riesz\nbasis for the direct sum space a complementary frame (or complement ) to\n{xj }.\nThe notion of strong complement has a natural generalization. Let\n{xn }n\u2208J and {yn }n\u2208J be Parseval frames in Hilbert spaces H, K, respec-\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\nlarson-chapter\n\nWavelet Sets and Operator-Theoretic Interpolation\n\n37\n\ntively, indexed by the same set J. Call these two frames strongly disjoint\nif the (inner) direct sum {xn \u2295 yn : n \u2208 J} is a Parseval frame for the\ndirect sum Hilbert space H \u2295 K. It is not hard to see that this property\nof strong disjointness is equivalent to the property that the ranges of their\nanalysis operators are orthogonal in l2 (J). More generally, we call a k-tuple\nof Parseval frames ({z1n }n\u2208J , . . . , {zkn }n\u2208J ) in Hilbert spaces H1 , . . . , Hk ,\nrespectively, a strongly disjoint k-tuple if {z1n \u2295 * * * \u2295 zkn : n \u2208 J} is\na Parseval frame for H1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Hk , and we call it a complete strongly\ndisjoint k-tuple if {z1n \u2295 * * * \u2295 zkn : n \u2208 J} is an orthonormal basis for\nH1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Hk . If \u03b8i : Hi \u2192 l2 (J) is the frame transform, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k, then\nstrong disjointness of a k-tuple is equivalent to mutual orthogonality of\n{ran \u03b8i : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k}, and complete strong disjointness is equivalent to the\nk\nL\nran \u03b8i = l2 (J).\ncondition that\ni=1\n\nThere is a particularly simple intrinsic (i.e. non-geometric) characterization of strong disjointness which is potentially useful in applications: Let\n{xn }n\u2208J and {yn }n\u2208J be Parseval frames for Hilbert spaces H and K, respectively. Then {xn } and {yn } are strongly disjoint if and only if one of\nthe equations\nX\nhx, xn iyn = 0 for all x \u2208 H\n(37)\nn\u2208J\n\nX\n\nor\n\nn\u2208J\n\nhy, yn ixn = 0 for all y \u2208 K\n\nholds. Moreover, if one holds the other holds also.\n3.4. Super-frames, Super-wavelets, and Multiplexing\nSuppose that {xn }n\u2208J and {yn }n\u2208J are strongly disjoint Parseval frames\nfor Hilbert spaces H and K, respectively. Then given any pair of vectors\nx \u2208 H, y \u2208 K, we have that\nX\nX\nx=\nhx, xn ixn ,\ny=\nhy, yn iyn .\nn\n\nn\n\nIf we let an = hx, xn i and bn = hy, yn i, and then let cn = an + bn , we have\nX\nX\nan yn = 0,\nbn xn = 0,\nn\n\nn\n\nby (37) and therefore we have\nX\nx=\ncn xn ,\nn\n\ny=\n\nX\nN\n\ncn y n .\n\n(38)\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\n38\n\nlarson-chapter\n\nLarson\n\nThis says that, by using one set of data {cn }, we can recover two vectors\nx and y (they may even lie in different Hilbert spaces) by applying the\nrespective inverse transforms (synthesis operators) corresponding to the\ntwo frame {xn } and {yn }. The above argument obviously extends to the\nk-tuple case: If {fin : n \u2208 J}, i = 1, . . . , k, is a strongly disjoint k-tuple\nof Parseval frames for Hilbert spaces H1 , . . . , Hk , and if (x1 , . . . , xk ) is an\narbitrary k-tuple of vectors with xi \u2208 Hi , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k, then (38) generalizes\nto\nX\nxi =\nhxi , fin ifin\nn\u2208J\n\nfor each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k. So if we define a single \"master\" sequence of complex\nnumbers {cn : n \u2208 J} by\ncn =\n\nk\nX\ni=1\n\nhxi , fin i,\n\nthen the strong disjointness implies that for each individual i we have\nX\nxi =\ncn fin .\nn\u2208J\n\nThis simple observation might be useful in applications to data compression.\nIn [33] we called such an n-tuple of strongly disjoint (or simply just\ndisjoint) frames a super-frame, because it (or rather its inner direct sum) is\na frame for the superspace which s the direct sum of the individual Hilbert\nspaces for the frames. In connection with wavelet systems this observation\nlead us to the notion of superwavelet, which is a particular type of vectorvalued wavelet. In operator-theoretic terms this is just a restatement of the\nfact outlined above that a strongly disjoint k-tuple of Parseval frames have\nframe-transforms which are isometries into the same space l2 (J) which have\nmutually orthogonal ranges.\nThe notion of superframes and superwavelets, and many of their properties, were also discovered and investigated by Radu Balan [3] in his Ph.D.\nthesis, in work that was completely independent from ours.\n3.5. Frame Vectors For Unitary Systems\nLet U be a unitary system on a Hilbert space H. Suppose W(U) is\nnonempty, and fix \u03c8 \u2208 W(U). Recall from Section 1 that if \u03b7 is an arbitrary vector in H, then \u03b7 \u2208 W(U) if and only if there is a unitary V (which\nis unique if it exists) in the local commutant C\u03c8 (U) such that V \u03c8 = \u03b7.\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\nWavelet Sets and Operator-Theoretic Interpolation\n\nlarson-chapter\n\n39\n\nThe following proposition shows that this idea generalizes to the theory of\nframes. Analogously to the notion of a wandering vector and a complete\nwandering vector, a vector x \u2208 H is called a Parseval frame vector (resp.\nframe vector with bounds a and b) for a unitary system U if Ux forms a\ntight frame (resp. frame with bounds a and b) for span(Ux). It is called a\ncomplete Parseval frame vector (resp. complete frame vector with bounds\na and b) when Ux is a Parseval frame (resp. frame with bounds a and b)\nfor H.\nProposition 15: Suppose that \u03c8 is a complete wandering vector for a\nunitary system U. Then\n(i) a vector \u03b7 is a Parseval frame vector for U if and only if there is a\n(unique) partial isometry A \u2208 C\u03c8 (U) such that A\u03c8 = \u03b7.\n(ii) a vector \u03b7 is a complete Parseval frame vector for U if and only if\nthere is a (unique) co-isometry A \u2208 C\u03c8 (U) such that A\u03c8 = \u03b7.\nThe above result does not tell the whole story. The reason is that many\nunitary systems do not have wandering vectors but do have frame vectors.\nFor instance, this is the case in Example 14, where the unitary system is the\ngroup of multiplication operators U = {Meins : n \u2208 Z} acting on L2 (E). In\nthe case of a unitary system such as the wavelet system UD,T there exist\nboth complete wandering vectors and nontrivial Parseval frame vectors, so\nthe theory seems richer (however less tractable) and Proposition 15 is very\nrelevant.\nMuch of Example 14 generalizes to the case of an arbitrary countable\nunitary group. There is a corresponding (geometric) dilation result.\nProposition 16: Suppose that U is a unitary group such that W(U) is\nnon-empty.

An Operator Model\nThe following is a corollary of Theorem 17. It shows that Example 14 can\nbe viewed as a model for certain operators.\nCorollary 19: Let T \u2208 B(H) be a unitary operator and let \u03b7 \u2208 H be a\nvector such that {T n\u03b7 : n \u2208 Z} is a Parseval frame for H. Then there is a\nunique (modulo a null set) measurable set E \u2282 T such that {T n \u03b7 : n \u2208 Z}\nand {eins |E : n \u2208 Z} are unitarily equivalent frames.\n3.7. Group Representations\nThese concepts generalize. For a unitary system U on a Hilbert space H,\na closed subspace M of H is called a complete wandering subspace for U\nif span {U M : U \u2208 U} is dense in H, and U M \u22a5 V M with U 6= V . Let\n{ei : i \u2208 I} be an orthonormal basis for M . Then M is a complete wandering subspace for U if and only if {U ei : U \u2208 U, i \u2208 I} is an orthonormal\nbasis for H. We call {ei } a complete multi-wandering vector. Analogously,\nan n-tuple (\u03b71 , . . . , \u03b7n ) of non-zero vectors (here n can be \u221e) is called complete Parseval multi-frame vector for U if {U \u03b7i : U \u2208 U, i = 1, . . . , n} forms\na complete Parseval frame for H. Let G be a group and let \u03bb be the left\nregular representation of G on l2 (G). Then {\u03bbg \u00d7In : g \u2208 G} has a complete\nmulti-wandering vector (f1 , . . . , fn ), where f1 = (xe , 0, . . . , 0), . . . , fn =\n(0, 0, . . . , xe ). Let P be any projection in the commutant of (\u03bb \u2297 In )(G).\nThen (P f1 , . . . , P fn ) is a complete Parseval multi-frame vector for the subrepresentation (\u03bb \u2297 In )|P . It turns out that every representation with a\ncomplete Parseval multi-frame vector arises in this way. Item (i) of the following theorem is elementary and was mentioned earlier; it is included for\ncompleteness.\nTheorem 20: Let G be a countable group and let \u03c0 be a representation\nof G on a Hilbert space H. Let \u03bb denote the left regular representation of\nG on l2 (G). Then\n(i) if \u03c0(G) has a complete wandering vector then \u03c0 is unitarily equivalent to \u03bb,\n(ii) if \u03c0(G) has a complete Parseval frame vector then \u03c0 is unitarily\nequivalent to a subrepresentation of \u03bb,\n(iii) if \u03c0(G) has a complete Parseval multi-frame vector\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\nlarson-chapter\n\nWavelet Sets and Operator-Theoretic Interpolation\n\n41\n\n{\u03c81 , \u03c82 , . . . , \u03c8n }, for some 1 \u2264 n < \u221e, then \u03c0 is unitarily equivalent to a subrepresentation of \u03bb \u2297 In .\n4. Decompositions of Operators and Operator-Valued\nFrames\nThe material we present here is contained in two recent papers. The first\n[15] was authored by a [VIGRE/REU] team consisting of K. Dykema, D.\nFreeman, K. Kornelson, D. Larson, M. Ordower, and E. Weber, with the\ntitle Ellipsoidal Tight Frames. This article started as an undergraduate research project at Texas A&M in the summer of 2002, in which Dan Freeman\nwas the student and the other five were faculty mentors. Freeman is now\na graduate student at Texas A&M. The project began as a solution of a\nfinite dimensional frame research problem, but developed into a rather technically deep theory concerning a class of frames on an infinite dimensional\nHilbert space. The second paper [44], entitled Rank-one decomposition of\noperators and construction of frames, is a joint article by K. Kornelson and\nD. Larson.\n4.1. Ellipsoidal Frames\nWe will use the term spherical frame (or uniform frame) for a frame sequence which is uniform in the sense that all its vectors have the same\nnorm. Spherical frames which are tight have been the focus of several articles by different researchers. Since frame theory is essentially geometric\nin nature, from a purely mathematical point of view it is natural to ask:\nWhich other surfaces in a finite or infinite dimensional Hilbert space contain tight frames? (These problems can make darn good REU projects, in\nparticular.) In the first article we considered ellipsoidal surfaces.\nBy an ellipsoidal surface we mean the image of the unit sphere S1 in the\nunderlying Hilbert space H under a bounded invertible operator A in B(H),\nthe set of all bounded linear operators on H. Let EA denote the ellipsoidal\nsurface EA := AS1 . A frame contained in EA is called an ellipsoidal frame,\nand if it is tight it is called an ellipsoidal tight frame (ETF) for that surface.\nWe say that a frame bound K is attainable for EA if there is an ETF for\nEA with frame bound K.\nGiven an ellipsoidal surface E := EA , we can assume E = ET where\nT is a positive invertible operator. Indeed, given an invertible operator A,\nlet A\u2217 = U |A\u2217 | be the polar decomposition, where |A\u2217 | = (AA\u2217 )1/2 . Then\nA = |A\u2217 |U \u2217 . By taking T = |A\u2217 |, we see that T S1 = AS1 . Moreover, it is\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n42\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\nlarson-chapter\n\nLarson\n\neasily seen that the positive operator T for which E = ET is unique.\nThe starting point for the work in the first paper was the following\nProposition. For his REU project Freeman found an elementary calculus\nproof of this for the real case. Others have also independently found this\nresult, including V. Paulsen, and P. Casazza and M. Leon.\nProposition 21: Let EA be an ellipsoidal surface on a finite dimensional\nreal or complex Hilbert space H of dimension n. Then for any integer k \u2265 n,\nEA contains a tight frame\nk, and every ETF on EA of length k\n\u0002 of length\u0003\u22121\nhas frame bound K = k trace(T \u22122 ) .\nWe use the following standard definition: For an operator B \u2208 H, the\nessential norm of B is:\nkBkess := inf{kB \u2212 Kk : K is a compact operator inB(H)}\nOur main frame theorem from the first paper is:\nTheorem 22: Let EA be an ellipsoidal surface in an infinite dimensional\nreal or complex Hilbert space. Then for any constant K > kT \u22122 k\u22121\ness , ET\ncontains a tight frame with frame bound K.\nSo, for fixed A, in finite dimensions the set of attainable ETF frame\nbounds is finite, whereas in infinite dimensions it is a continuum.\nProblem. If the essential norm of A is replaced with the norm of A in the\nabove theorem, or if the inequality is replaced with equality, then except for\nsome special cases, and trivial cases, no theorems of any degree of generality\nare known concerning the set of attainable frame bounds for ETF's on EA .\nIt would be interesting to have a general analysis of the case where A \u2212 I\nis compact. In this case, one would want to know necessary and sufficient\nconditions for existence of a tight frame on EA with frame bound 1. In the\nspecial case A = I then, of course, any orthonormal basis will do, and these\nare the only tight frames on EA in this case. What happens in general when\nkAkess = 1 and A is a small perturbation of I?\nWe use elementary tensor notation for a rank-one operator on H. Given\nu, v, x \u2208 H, the operator u \u2297 v is defined by (u \u2297 v)x = hx, viu for x \u2208 H.\nThe operator u \u2297 u is a projection if and only if kuk = 1.\nLet {xj }j be a frame for H. The standard frame operator is defined by:\nP\nP\nP\nSw = j hw, xj ixj = j (xj \u2297 xj ) w . Thus S = j xj \u2297 xj , where this\nseries of positive rank-1 operators converges in the strong operator topology\n(i.e. the topology of pointwise convergence). In the special case where each\nxj is a unit vector, S is the sum of the rank-1 projections Pj = xj \u2297 xj .\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\nWavelet Sets and Operator-Theoretic Interpolation\n\nlarson-chapter\n\n43\n\nFor A a positive operator, we say that A has a projection decomposition\nif A can be expressed as the sum of a finite or infinite sequence of (not\nnecessarily mutually orthogonal) self-adjoint projections, with convergence\nin the strong operator topology.\nP\nIf xj is a frame of unit vectors, then S = j xj \u2297 xj is a projection\ndecomposition of the frame operator. This argument is trivially reversible,\nso a positive invertible operator S is the frame operator for a frame of unit\nP\nvectors if and only if it admits a projection decomposition S = j PJ . If the\nprojections in the decomposition are not of rank one, each projection can\nbe further decomposed (orthogonally) into rank-1 projections, as needed,\nP\nexpressing S = n xn \u2297 xn , and then the sequence {xn } is a frame of unit\nvectors with frame operator S.\nIn order to prove Theorem 22, we first proved Theorem 23 (below),\nusing purely operator-theoretic techniques.\nTheorem 23: Let A be a positive operator in B(H) for H a real or complex\nHilbert space with infinite dimension, and suppose kAkess > 1. Then A has\na projection decomposition.\nSuppose, then, that {xn } is a frame of unit vectors with frame operator\n1\nS. If we let yj = S \u2212 2 xj , then {yj }j is a Parseval frame. So {yj }j is an\n1\nellipsoidal tight frame for the ellipsoidal surface E \u2212 12 = S \u2212 2 S1 . This arS\ngument is reversible: Given a positive invertible operator T , let S = T \u22122 .\nP\nScale T if necessary so that kSkess > 1. Let S = j xj \u2297 xj be a projection\ndecomposition of S. Then {T xj } is an ETF for the ellipsoidal surface T S1 .\nConsideration of frame bounds and scale factors then yields Theorem 22.\nMost of our second paper concerned weighted projection decompositions of positive operators, and resultant theorems concerning frames. If T\nis a positive operator, and if {cn } is a sequence of positive scalars, then a\nweighted projection decomposition of T with weights {cn } is a decompoP\nsition T = j Pj where the Pj are projections, and the series converges\nstrongly. We have since adopted the term targeted to refer to such a decomposition, and generalizations thereof. By a targeted decomposition of T\nP\nwe mean any strongly convergent decomposition T = n Tn where the Tn\nis a sequence of simpler positive operators with special prescribed properties. So a weighted decomposition is a targeted decomposition for which the\nscalar weights are the prescribed properties. And, of course, a projection\ndecomposition is a special case of targeted decomposition.\nAfter a sequence of Lemmas, building up from finite dimensions and\nemploying spectral theory for operators, we arrived at the following theo-\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\n44\n\nlarson-chapter\n\nLarson\n\nrem. We will not discuss the details here because of limited space. It is the\nweighted analogue of theorem 23.\nTheorem 24: Let B be a positive operator in B(H) for H with kBkess >\n1. Let {ci }\u221e\ni=1 be any sequence of numbers with 0 < ci \u2264 1 such that\nP\nc\n=\n\u221e.\nThen there exists a sequence of rank-one projections {Pi }\u221e\ni\ni=1\ni\nP\u221e\nsuch that B = i=1 ci Pi\n4.2. A Problem in Operator Theory\nWe will discuss a problem in operator theory that was motivated by a problem in the theory of Modulation Spaces. We tried to obtain an actual \"reformulation\" of the modulation space problem in terms of operator theory,\nand it is well possible that such a reformulation can be found. At the least\nwe (Chris Heil and myself) found the following operator theory problem,\nwhose solution could conceivably impact mathematics beyond operator theory. I find it rather fascinating. I need to note that we subsequently showed\n(in an unpublished jointly-written expository article) that the actual modulation space connection requires a modified and more sophisticated version\nof the problem we present below. I still feel, that the problem I will present\nhere has some independent interest, and may serve as a \"first step\" in developing a theory that might have some usefulness. Thus, I hope that the\nreader will find it interesting.\n\nLet H be an infinite dimensional separable Hilbert space. As usual,\ndenote the Hilbert space norm on H by k * k. If x and y are vectors in H,\nthen x\u2297y will denote the operator of rank one defined by (x\u2297y)z = hz, yix.\nThe operator norm of x \u2297 y is then just the product of kxk and kyk.\nFix an orthonormal basis {en }n for H. For each vector v in H, define\nX\nk|vk| =\n|hv, en i|\nn\n\nThis may be +\u221e.\n\nLet L be the set of all vectors v in H for which k|vk| is finite. Then L is\na dense linear subspace of H, and is a Banach space in the \"triple norm\".\nIt is of course isomorphic to l1\nLet T be any positive trace-class operator in B(H).\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\nlarson-chapter\n\nWavelet Sets and Operator-Theoretic Interpolation\n\n45\n\nThe usual eigenvector decomposition for T expresses T as a series converging in the strong operator topology of operators hn \u2297 hn , where {hn }\nis an orthogonal sequence of eigenvectors of T . That is,\nX\nT =\nhn \u2297 hn\nn\n\nIn this representation the eigenvalue corresponding to the eigenvector hn is\nthe square of the norm: khn k2 . The trace of T is then\nX\nkhn k2\nn\n\nand since T is positive this is also the trace-class norm of T .\n\nLet us say that T is of Type A with respect to the orthonormal basis\nP\n2\n{en } if, for the eigenvectors {hn } as above, we have that\nn k|hn k| is\nfinite. [Note that this is just the (somewhat unusual) formula displayed\nabove for the trace of T with the triple norm used in place of the usual\nHilbert space norm of the vectors {hn }.]\nAnd let us say that T is of Type B with respect to the orthonormal\nP\nbasis {en } if there is some sequence of vectors {vn } in H with n k|vn k|2\nfinite such that\nX\nT =\nvn \u2297 hn\nn\n\nwhere the convergence of this series is in the strong operator topology.\n\nProblem: If T if of Type B with respect to an orthonormal basis {en },\nthen must it be of Type A with respect to {en }?\nNote: If the answer to this problem is negative (as I suspect it is), then\nthe following subproblem would be an interesting one.\nSubproblem: Let {en } be an orthonormal basis for H. Find a characterization of all positive trace class operators T that are of Type B with\nrespect to {en }. In particular, is every positive trace class operator T of\nType B with respect to {en }? My feeling is no. (See the next example.)\nExample 25: Let x be any vector in H that is not in L, and let T = x \u2297 x.\nThen T is trace class, in fact has rank one, but clearly T is clearly not of\nType A. Can such a T be of type B? (I don't think it is necessarily of Type\nB for all such T , however.)\n\n\fAugust 4, 2018\n\n16:22\n\nWSPC/Lecture Notes Series: 9in x 6in\n\n46\n\nlarson-chapter\n\nLarson\n\nReferences\n1. A.
