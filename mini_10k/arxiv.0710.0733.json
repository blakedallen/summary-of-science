Box 513, 5600 MB Eindhoven, The Netherlands\n(Dated: October 2, 2007)\nThe scattering length is commonly used to characterize the strength of ultracold atomic interactions, since it is the leading parameter in the low-energy expansion of the scattering phase shift. Its\nvalue can be modified via a magnetic field, by using a Feshbach resonance. However, the effective\nrange term, which is the second parameter in the phase shift expansion, determines the width of\nthe resonance and gives rise to important properties of ultracold gases. Independent control over\nthis parameter is not possible by using a magnetic field only. We demonstrate that a combination\nof magnetic and electric fields can be used to get independent control over both parameters, which\nleads to full control over elastic ultracold interactions.\nPACS numbers: 33.40.+f, 34.50.-s, 34.20.Cf\n\nCold atomic gases with resonant interactions are extremely versatile systems. They allow for the experimental realization of a variety of fundamental models\nfrom condensed matter or high energy physics, and can\ngo well beyond the basics of those models. Illustrative examples are the experiments on the crossover between BCS- and BEC-type superfluidity with fermionic\ngases [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], and the experimental signature of the long-sought three-body Efimov trimer states\nwith bosonic gases [8]. Also, mixtures of fermionic and\nbosonic atoms lead to interesting possibilities: heteronuclear molecules can be created with anisotropic interactions, for which new quantum phases have been predicted\n[9, 10, 11, 12].\nKey to these exciting developments is the ability to\nprecisely control the interatomic interactions in ultracold\nalkali-metal gases. Magnetic field induced Feshbach resonances [13] have been the indispensable tool providing\nexperimental control of the strength of the interactions.\nThe low-energy interactions are characterized by the swave scattering length and can be tuned from weak to\nstrong and from repulsive to attractive by simply changing the magnetic field. Magnetic field sweeps over a\nFeshbach resonance have been used to create ultracold\nmolecules [14, 15, 16, 17].\nThe width of the Feshbach resonance is an important\nparameter that is directly related to the energy dependence of the interactions. In the case of a broad resonance, the scattering length can be used to describe the\nsystem at all relevant energy scales, leading to universal\nbehavior [18, 19, 20, 21]. However, in the case of a narrow\nFeshbach resonance the microscopic physics underlying\nthe resonance can give rise to non-trivial energy dependence and additional scattering parameters are needed to\ndescribe the system [22, 23, 24, 25]. The energy dependence of the interaction strength may lead to interesting\nnew physics such as the localisation of Efimov states [26],\nphonon-like induced superfluidity in fermionic gases [27],\nas well as a clearly distinct Higgs mode in the excitation\nspectrum of superfluid fermions [28].\n\nA second way of tuning the low energy properties\nof these systems is to apply a dc electric field [29, 30,\n31, 32]. The electric field polarizes the colliding atoms\nand induces an electric dipole-dipole interaction. This\nanistropic interaction couples states of different orbital\nangular momentum. The coupling can give rise to potential or Feshbach resonances in the s-wave scattering\nlength at particular electric field values.\nIn the presence of either an electric or a magnetic field,\nthe zero-energy scattering length is the only parameter\nthat can be independently tuned. However, we demonstate that for a suitable combination of electric and magnetic fields the width of the Feshbach resonance can also\nbe controlled. In this work we focus on the interplay between the electric field induced potential resonances and\nmagnetic field induced Feshbach resonances, which leads\nto the possibility of tailoring the energy dependence of\nthe interactions.\nThis work is organised as follows: We start by explaining the physics underlying the interesting interplay between the potential and Feshbach resonances, as induced\nand controlled by electric and magnetic fields. We indicate how a simple analytical model captures the essential\nphysics and compare the model to full coupled-channels\ncalculations. Since rubidium is currently used in electric\ntrap experiments [33, 34], we give several examples of the\ninteraction properties of 85 Rb atoms. It can be considered as a model system used to give a proof-of-principle\nof the tunability of the energy dependence of the interactions. We end with concluding remarks.\nFeshbach resonances originate from the coupling of\ntwo atoms interacting via an energetically open channel, to one (or several) bound state(s) in energetically\nclosed channels. The position of the bound state(s) can\nbe tuned by changing the magnetic field. When such\na bound state is energetically close to the relative kinetic energy of the two atoms, the scattering process becomes resonant. The signature of a potential resonance\nis a large (absolute) value of the background scattering length, much larger than the range of the van der\n\n\f2\nWaals potential rVDW = (mC6 /16~2 )1/4 [35], with m\nthe atomic mass and C6 the van der Waals dispersion\ncoefficient. In previous work [25] we derived a conceptually simple model that encapsulates all the essential\nphysics of the open and closed channel resonance states,\nand gives a very accurate description of, for instance, the\nmolecular energies and scattering phase shifts for all energies and magnetic fields of interest. At zero energy, the\nscattering properties are conveniently summarized by the\ns-wave scattering length\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2206B\n,\n(1)\na(B) = r0 + aP 1 \u2212\nB \u2212 B0\nwhere r0 \u2243 rVDW is the non-resonant and aP the resonant part of the open-channel (or background) scattering\nlength. The Feshbach resonance is located at the field\nB0 and is furthermore characterized by the width \u2206B.\nThere is a fundamental relation between the width of\nthe resonance \u2206B and the energy dependence of the interatomic interactions, described by the scattering phase\nshift [27]:\n\u0001\n\u03b4(k) = \u2212kr0 \u2212 arg (\u03b6k ) \u2212 arg E \u2212 \u03bd + iCk\u03b6k\u22121 , (2)\nwhere E = ~2 k 2 /m is the relative collision energy of\nthe atoms in the open channel, \u03b6k = 1 + ikaP , \u03bd =\n\u2206\u03bcmag (B \u2212B0 ) the detuning of the closed-channel bound\nstate and C = aP \u2206\u03bcmag \u2206B proportional to the width of\nthe resonance, with \u2206\u03bcmag the magnetic moment difference between the open-channel scattering threshold and\nthe closed-channel bound state. At the resonant field B0 ,\nthe resonance width can be related to a length scale that\nplays the role of an effective range parameter [27]:\n\n~2\n\u03b6k .\n(3)\nm(C \u2212 aP \u03bd)\n\u221a\nIn the case that R\u2217 \u226a r0 and R\u2217 aP \u226a r0 , the resonance is called broad and the phaseshift is well described\nby the simple relation \u03b4(k) = \u2212 arctan [ka(B)] for the energies k \u221a\n\u226a r0\u22121 of interest to cold collisions. If R\u2217 \u226b r0\nand/or R\u2217 aP \u226b r0 , the resonance is narrow and energy dependent corrections beyond the scattering length\napproximation are needed to properly describe the interactions. In all cases Eq. (2) gives an accurate description\nat all relevant energies.\nIn the presence of an electric field, the electronic swave symmetry of the individual atoms is distorted due\nto the electric dipole coupling with excited electronic pwave states. At sufficiently weak fields the atoms acquire\na dipole moment according to di = \u03b1i (0)\u03b5, where \u03b1i (0)\nis the static electric polarizability of atom i, and \u03b5 is\nthe applied electric field. The interaction between the\nelectric dipoles takes the familiar form [36]:\nR\u2217 (B) =\n\n\u03b11 (0)\u03b12 (0)\n[\u03b5 * \u03b5 \u2212 3 (\u03b5 * r\u0302) (\u03b5 * r\u0302)] ,\n4\u03c0\u01eb0 r3\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u01eb0 is the vacuum dielectric constant. The angledependent structure of the anistropic interactions can be\nrewritten in terms of a scalar product of two irreducible\nspherical tensors of rank 2. Due to its tensorial nature,\nthe anisotropic part of the interaction obeys triangle type\nselection rules and couples states with orbital angular\nmomentum according to the selection rule l \u2212 l\u2032 = 0, 2,\nwith the exception of l = 0 \u2192 l\u2032 = 0 [36].\nWhen an electric field is applied, the coupling between\ndifferent angular momentum states has several important\neffects. First of all, the energy of the weakliest bound (or\nvirtual) state in the open channel is shifted, and the sign\nand strength of the open-channel scattering, characterized by aP = aP (\u03b5), can be tuned in and out of resonance\n(see inset Fig. 2). This also allows for control of the energy dependence of the interactions, characterized by R\u2217 .\nIt can be shown that the width of the resonance is proportional to the resonant part of the open-channel scattering\nlength, \u2206B \u221d aP and therefore C \u221d (aP )2 . The effective\nrange parameter R\u2217 can be controlled through its dependence on aP and C. Furthermore, the energies of the\ns-wave bound states in the closed channels are shifted,\nwhich leads to a shift in the positions of the Feshbach\nresonances, B0 = B0 (\u03b5), and additional (usually very\nnarrow) resonances show up due to the electric field induced coupling of the open-channel scattering state to\nclosed-channel bound states.\nUsing the electric field, the interactions at non-zero\nenergies can be controlled. The magnetic field can be\nused independently to control the total scattering length\na(B, \u03b5) at this particular electric field value. This independent control of the zero-energy interactions, and\nthe non-zero energy corrections, provides the unique opportunity to tailor the interatomic interactions in many\npossible ways. In practice, this means full control over\nthe elastic interactions in the ultracold regime. We give\ninteresting examples in the remainder of this work.\nWe use a full coupled-channels method [37] for a rigorous determination of the scattering properties of the Rb\natoms. The spin-spin interaction in this method comes\nfrom the magnetic dipole and second-order spin-orbit interactions, and its angular structure is very similar to\nthe electrically induced dipole-dipole interaction, which\nhas its origin in the Stark effect. We extended the existing numerical code by carefully including the electric\ndipole-dipole interactions, allowing for arbitrary relative\norientations of the applied magnetic and electric fields.\nInterestingly, to a high degree the two fields operate on\nindependent degrees of freedom: B influences the spin\nsystem and \u03b5 the orbital system. Each of these subsystems has its rotational symmetry axis, the directions of\nB and \u03b5, respectively, and therefore its own conserved\nquantum numbers (mF k B and ml k \u03b5). Only the relatively weak spin-spin interaction correlates the two parts.\nVarying the orientation of B or \u03b5 in future experiments\nmight therefore offer fascinating prospects for studying\n\n\f3\n4000\n\n300\n\n3000\n\n250\n2000\n\n200\n7\n\n9 10 V/m\n\n0\n\n7\n\n0 10 V/m\n\n\u22121000\n\n150\n4000\n\n\u22122000\n\n5 107 V/m\n\n100\n\naP/a0\n\n0\n\n\u22123000\n\u22124000\n0\n\nB (G)\n\na (a0)\n\n1000\n\n50\n50\n\n100\n\n150\nB (G)\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) s-wave scattering length a as a function\nof the magnetic field at three different electric field strengths.\n\nquantum degenerate gas samples with different preferred\nelectric and magnetic axes. From this point of view 87 Rb\nmight be a promising choice, since its d-wave shape resonance may be expected to enhance collective quadrupole\noscillations of atom pairs induced by time-varying magnetic or electric fields.\nWe now consider 85 Rb atoms in the (f1 , f2 )F, mF =\n(2, 2)4, \u22124 two-particle hyperfine state, where fi are the\nhyperfine quantum numbers of the individual atoms that\nadd up to total spin F with projection mF on the magnetic axis. The electric field is taken parallel to the magnetic field. In this case, there is only one s-wave channel\nthat is energetically open. We calculated the scattering\nlength for this channel as a function of the magnetic field\nat several electric field strengths, and typical results are\nshown in Fig. 1. In principle, the coupling to l 6= 0 open\nchannels can give rise to inelastic losses. However, in the\ncases we consider here the effect is very small and can be\nneglected.\nIn the absence of an electric field, there are several\nFeshbach resonances within the range of magnetic fields\nshown, as seen from the continuous line of Fig. 1. The\nbroad resonance at B0 = 154.85 G is related to an swave molecular state with total spin quantum number\nF = 4, while there is a narrow resonance at B0 \u2243 220.20\nG that originates from an F = 6 s-wave molecular state.\nThe other resonances shown are extremely narrow and\noriginate in the anisotropic coupling to F = 6 closedchannel bound states with l = 2. The large and negative\nbackground scattering length abg = r0 + aP consists of\na non-resonant part r0 \u2243 120 a0 and a resonant part\naP \u2243 \u2212570 a0 related to a virtual state. Examples of the\nscattering length at non-zero electric fields are shown as\nthe dashed and dash-dotted line. It is clear that the electric field has a large effect on the resonance structure.\nThe Feshbach resonances that were considered initially\nat zero field are shifted towards lower or higher magnetic\nfields and their widths are increased or decreased by orders of magnitude.\nIn Fig. 2 we show the magnetic field position of the\n\n\u22124000\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n4\n6\n\u03b5 (107 V/m)\n\n8\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Position B0 of several resonances as a\nfunction of magnetic and electric fields. See text for details.\nInset: resonant part aP of open channel scattering length as\na function of electric field.\n\nbroadest resonance (thick red line) as a function of the\napplied electric field. The position of the bare closedchannel state, shifted from the (dressed) resonance position by the width as B0\u2032 = B0 \u2212 \u2206B [25], is shown as the\ndash-dotted line. The narrow resonances are indicated\nby thin lines. If the electric field is increased, the bare\nstates are shifted due to their anisotropic coupling with\nother closed-channel states. Simultaneously, the virtual\nstate in the open channel, coupled to l 6= 0 open-channel\nstates, approaches the scattering threshold and becomes\nbound at the resonance field of about \u03b5r \u2243 5.3 * 107 V/m.\nThis gives rise to a divergence in the open channel scattering length aP , as clearly visible in the inset of Fig. 2.\nFor \u03b5 > \u03b5r , aP changes sign and for high electric fields\nthe open channel eventually becomes non-resonant.\nFrom Fig. 2 it is evident that the electric field induced\ncouplings give rise to an avoided crossing between the\nopen-channel shape resonance and the Feshbach resonance. We checked that this avoided crossing is accurately described by the analytical scattering model of\nRef. [25], which predicts the scaling \u2206B \u221d aP . Using\nthis model, the numerical data of Fig. 2 (thick red line)\nare accurately reproduced.\nFrom these considerations, we reach the exciting conclusion that the width of the resonance can be simply\ncontrolled by varying the electric field. It can be increased when approaching the resonance in aP at \u03b5r .\nWhen aP becomes non-resonant at high electric fields,\nthe Feshbach resonance becomes narrower. An example\nis shown by the dash-dotted line of Fig. 1, where the\nscattering length shows a narrow resonance at a field of\nB0 = 26.1 G, which is related to the same F = 4 molecular state that gives rise to the broad 154.9 G resonance\nat zero electric field.\nPerhaps the most interesting situation to study is a\nnarrow resonance with a resonant open channel. In the\nvicinity of \u03b5r , where aP can be tuned to large positive or\n\n\f4\n1.5\n\nscattering phase\n\n1\n\nattractive\n\n0.5\n0\n\u22120.5\n\u22121\n\u22121.5\n0\n\nrepulsive\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\nE/kB (K)\n\n2\n\n2.5\nx 10\n\n\u22125\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Example of the tunability of the scattering phase shift by a suitable combination of magnetic and\nelectric fields. Solid line: B = 179.4 G, dash-dotted line:\nB = 179.46 G.\n\nnegative values, we therefore focus our attention on one\nof the additional narrow resonances that are coupled in\nby the electric field. We fix the electric field just above\nthe electrically induced resonance at \u03b5 = 5.6 * 107 V/m.\nThis gives a large and positive aP = 1916 a0 (see inset Fig. 2), related to a weakly bound state in the open\nchannel. The magnetic field is tuned close to the narrow\nresonance at B0 = 179.50 G. At the left side of the resonance, where there are no molecules in the system, the\ntotal scattering length is first large and negative, but has\na zero crossing at 179.48 G. Just to the left of this zero\ncrossing, the scattering length becomes positive and the\nzero-energy interactions have a repulsive character. However, due to the fact that this resonance is very narrow,\nthe interactions become attractive at non-zero energies,\nwhich can for instance lead to the formation of a BCS-like\nstate with positive scattering length [27]. The tunability\nof the energy dependence of the interactions is shown in\nFig. 3.\nIn conclusion, we showed that the energy dependence\nof the interactions can be controlled by combining electric and magnetic fields. This is particularly interesting\nin two-component fermionic systems, where the electric\nfield could potentially be used to control the crossover\nfrom universal behavior to non-universal behavior by\ntuning the Feshbach resonance from broad to narrow.\nTunability of the open-channel scattering length aP allows for a systematic study of the interplay between openchannel shape resonances and closed-channel Feshbach\nresonances. Another exciting application is in the study\nof three-body Efimov physics, where the control of the effective range parameter R\u2217 gives rise to a tunable threebody parameter [26].\nIn this work, we used 85 Rb to give a proof-of-principle\nof the tunability of the relevant interaction parameters,\nsuch as the width and open-channel (background) scattering length. A disadvantage of this particular system\nis the relatively high electric field of order 500 kV/cm\nneeded to achieve the full control over the ultracold in-\n\nteractions. However, the effect is very general and similar\ncontrol can be achieved in ultracold gases of other alkalimetal atoms. Especially a mixture of different species,\nin particular light and heavy atoms. Good candidates\nare 6 Li fermions with 40 K fermions or 133 Cs bosons, as\nthe permanent dipole moment of the heteronuclear collision complexes gives rise to much lower necessary electric\nfields of order of tens of kV/cm, easily generated in current experiments [31, 32]. The necessary fields of order\nof hundreds of kV/cm could perhaps be reached in experiments utilizing atom chips.\nWe thank P. Pinkse for usefull discussions.
