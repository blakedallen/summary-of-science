Introduction\nIn spite of their great astrophysical importance (Muzzin et al.\n2009), many aspects of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars remain poorly understood (e.g. Kerschbaum et al. 2011, and references therein). Among the AGB stars, the luminous Mira\nvariables might be the most enigmatic with their long-period,\nlarge-amplitude pulsations and high mass-loss rates. In particular our understanding of their atmospheric structure, which is the\nlink between enriched stellar interior and evolution-dominating\nwind, is at a turning point, thanks to advances on both the observational side (IR interferometry), and the modelling side with a\nnew generation of self-excited atmosphere models.\nThe public release of four CODEX model series for M-type\nMira variables by Ireland et al. (2011, hereafter ISW11), greatly\nincreases the opportunities for the general community to assess\nthe performance of such dynamic models. Here, we present the\nfirst confrontation of the CODEX models (see Sect. 3) to a fully\nphase-resolved 2 \u03bcm spectro-photometric and interferometric\ndataset covering eight pulsation cycles, as obtained with the\nPalomar Testbed Interferometer on the Mira TU And. This star\nhas a spectral type M5IIIe, a progenitor mass M = 1.15\u22121.4 M\u2299,\nmetallicity Z = 0.004 \u2212 0.02 (Mennessier et al. 2001), and a\nGCVS period P\u223c317 d (Samus et al. 2009).\nThe most intriguing result of this comparison is that there\nseems to be a systematic discrepancy between the models and\nour observations around visual maximum: the star appears too\nhot, and its outer atmosphere too devoid of water. An identifica\u22c6\nPostdoctoral Fellow, Fund for Scientific Research of Flanders\n(FWO)\n\ntion of the source of this discrepancy is hampered by the limited\ncoverage in parameter space of the models, but we discuss possible avenues of further research, and stress the need for larger\npublished model grids and for observational campaigns covering\nthe visual maximum phase in detail.\n\n2. Observations\nTU And was extensively observed as part of the large PTI Mira\nprogramme (Thompson 2002) during 60 nights from 1999 to\n2005, over eight pulsation cycles. The publicly available PTI\ndata archive provides both squared visibility amplitudes (hereafter visibilities) and integrated photon counts. We describe the\ndata reduction and calibration of these observables below.\n2.1. Interferometry\n\nThe now dismounted Palomar Testbed Interferometer (PTI)\nwas a Y-shaped, long-baseline near-IR interferometer located\nat Palomar Observatory and operated by JPL/Caltech. It consisted of three 40 cm apertures with separations of 85-110 m\nand used in pairwise combination (see Colavita et al. 1999, for\na detailed description). PTI thus measured only one interferometric observable per spectral channel: the square of the \"fringe\ncontrast\" or visibility amplitude. Visibilities were recorded in\nfive channels within the K-band (2.0-2.4 \u03bcm). Processing of the\nraw data (correcting for detector biases and read-out noise, and\naveraging the 125s scans into fringe amplitudes) was automatically done on site, following procedures described in Colavita\n(1999). Calibrating for the system visibility, i.e. the response\n1\n\n\fHillen et al.: Comparing the CODEX models to PTI time series of TU And\n\nof the measurement system (interferometer + atmosphere) to\na point source, was done using the nbCalib tool (Boden et al.\n1998) provided by the NExScI which uses a weighted-mean\nformalism to estimate the system visibility at the time and position of the science observation from all calibrator measurements that fit the user-defined temporal and spatial constraints\n(see van Belle et al. 1999, for more details). To ensure calibration stability and consistency, essential for making full use of\nthis data set as an interferometric time series, several calibrators\nwere observed each night and were intercompared by nbCalib.\nThe stellar parameters of our calibrators were determined by\nfitting a reddened Kurucz model atmosphere (Kurucz 1993) to\nhigh-quality archival photometry. The errors were estimated using Monte Carlo simulations. Table 1 (only available electronically) lists the calibrators and their adopted parameters. All calibrators have angular diameters well below the PTI resolution\nlimit of 1 mas (van Belle & van Belle 2005) and are, on average,\n10\u25e6 away from the science target.\nThe calibrated visibilities of TU And from 50 nights were\nretained, having a median relative precision ranging from 5% at\n2.2 \u03bcm, 7.5% at 2.4 \u03bcm and 10% at 2.0 \u03bcm.\n2.2. Spectro-photometry\n\nTogether with the uncalibrated visibilities, PTI delivered the raw\nphoton counts of each observation, typically in blocks of five observations taken within minutes and interleaving science targets\nwith calibrators. We derived the spectral shape over the K-band\nand flux-calibrated the 2.2 \u03bcm channel with a bootstrap method.\nThe spectral shape calibration procedure consists of dividing the science-target normalised photon counts by the ones\nof the calibrator and multiplying the result with the intrinsic\nspectral shape of the calibrator. To obtain an absolute flux in\nthe 2.2 \u03bcm channel, one calibrator measurement on either side\nof the science observation with respect to airmass is required\nto solve for the atmospheric extinction per unit airmass Av =\n(log[I2 /I1 ] + log[S 1 /S 2 ])/(m2 \u2212 m1 ) and the instrument spectral\nresponse Rv = S 1 /(I1 \u00d7 exp(\u2212Av m1 )), with Ii the intrinsic and S i\nthe measured flux, and mi the airmass, of the ith calibrator. The\ncalibrated flux is then calculated as I sci = S sci /Rv \u00d7 exp(Av m sci ),\nwhere S sci denotes the measured photon counts and m sci the airmass of the science target. For each observing block, the above\nprocedure is applied 5000 times to a randomly picked science\nobservation, corresponding random calibrator observations and\ncalibrator intrinsic fluxes. Finally, the distributions of all observing blocks within a single night are co-added, and the average\nand standard deviation are taken from the resulting normal distribution, as the final calibrated flux and its error.\nTo obtain the calibrator intrinsic fluxes, the PTI optical configuration was taken into account: after beam combination and\ndispersion by a prism, the wavefront was sent through a broadband K Barr filter onto the detector pixels (Colavita et al. 1999).\nEach of the Kurucz models in the Monte Carlo distributions obtained with the spectral energy distribution fitting, is converted\ninto the effective flux I in each of the PTI channels as:\nR \u03bbu\n[(M * F) \u2297 G]\u03bbd\u03bb\n\u03bb\nI = lR\u03bb\n(1)\nu\n[F\n\u2297\nG]\u03bbd\u03bb\n\u03bb\nl\n\nwith M the Kurucz model, F the filter profile, G a Gaussian of\nFWHM = 0.7 \u03bcm (M. Colavita, private communication), and \u03bbl ,\n\u03bbu the edges of the spectral channel under consideration.\nFinally, we constructed a visual light curve by retrieving observed V-band photometry from the AAVSO and AFOEV. Visual\n\n2\n\nphases (hereafter simply phases) were computed by fitting a sine\nto ten cycles around the times of the PTI observations.\n\n3. The CODEX models\nThe CODEX atmosphere models (Ireland et al. 2008) are the\nmost advanced publicly available dynamical models for M-type\nMira variables. The pulsations in these models are self-excited\nand limited in amplitude by the non-linear effects of shocks in\nthe outer atmosphere and by turbulent viscosity. For each model\nseries, a few typical cycles were selected for detailed radiative\ntransfer calculations with an opacity-sampling method in LTE\nwith a phase-resolution of \u223c 0.1. This results in the centre-tolimb variation (CLV) and spectrum, with \u2206\u03bb = 0.0002 \u03bcm between \u03bb = 0.45 \u2212 2.50 \u03bcm. The current model series are made\nto match o Cet, R Leo, and R Cas, although even these wellobserved Miras have large uncertainties on their basic parameters (e.g. the 2 very different models for R Cas). They were presented to the community and compared to photometric and interferometric observations in ISW11. The model parameters are\nmass M, luminosity L, metallicity Z, mixing length parameter\n\u03b1m , and turbulent viscosity parameter \u03b1\u03bd . For a detailed justification of the current set of parameter values, we refer to ISW11.\nWith a slightly meandering (\u00b1 5 d) pulsation period of\n\u223c317 d, TU And is compared to the R52 (M = 1.1 M\u2299 , L =\n5200 L\u2299, Z = 0.02, \u03b1m = 3.5, \u03b1\u03bd = 0.25) and o54 (M = 1.1 M\u2299 ,\nL = 5400 L\u2299, Z = 0.02, \u03b1m = 3.5, \u03b1\u03bd = 0.25) model series,\nwhich have derived periods of 307 and 330 d, respectively.\nWhen comparing a model series to observations, the only\nfree parameter is the distance, or equivalently, the phaseaveraged Rosseland angular diameter \u03b8R . Considering the angular resolution of PTI, we converted the model intensities to synthetic observables for \u03b8R \u2208 [1.5, 4.5] mas, in steps of 0.05 mas.\nConverting the model intensities to the spectro-photometric observables was done with Eq. 1. The squared visibilities are computed following Wittkowski et al.

Results\nFigure 1 shows the resulting photometric time series of TU\nAnd as a function of phase, with two consecutive cycles of the\nR52 model series repeatedly overplotted. The two other available cycles of this series give qualitatively identical results, so\nare not shown. The Rosseland angular diameter is chosen to\nmatch the absolute flux at 2.2 \u03bcm, with a resulting value of\n\u03b8R = 2.20 \u00b1 0.15 mas or d = 1.13 \u00b1 0.07 kpc. Although the\nerror on the absolute calibration in this channel is rather large,\nthe contamination from upper atmospheric molecular layers at\nthese wavelengths is smallest. This channel thus provides the\nbest view at the continuum photosphere in the spectral region\nwhere the bulk of the luminosity is emitted. Moreover, fixing the\nangular diameter like this gives a consistent picture in both the\nspectro-photometry and the interferometry.\n\n\f1.1\n1.0\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n1.1\n1.0\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n2.2\n1.8\n1.4\n1.0\n0.6\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n\n2.0 \u03bcm\n\n2 . 1 \u03bcm\n\n2.3 \u03bcm\n\n2 . 4 \u03bcm\n\nV-mag\n\nFlux2.2 (100 Jy)\n\nFlux/Flux2.2\n\nFlux/Flux2.2\n\nHillen et al.: Comparing the CODEX models to PTI time series of TU And\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\u03c6V\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nThe R52 model series shows reasonable agreement with the\nobserved visual light curve in the lower panel, considering that\n(1) the amplitude was not tuned to match this light curve and\n(2) non-LTE effects play an important role at these wavelengths\n(Ireland et al. 2008), causing an increase in visual brightness of\n0.5 to 1.0 magnitude. In case the higher value of this correction\nis valid, the perceived difference between model and observations could point to the presence of an excess in visual light at\nmaximum phases together with a too large model amplitude.\nThe two upper panels show the variation in the spectral shape\nwith time. A clear discrepancy occurs around times of visual\nmaximum, then the model predicts too much flux. Moreover,\nthe amplitude of this excess shows an interesting wavelengthdependence: the strongest effect is observed at 2.0 \u03bcm, a smaller\ndiscrepancy at 2.1 and 2.4 \u03bcm and a good agreement at 2.3 \u03bcm.\nThe visibility time series is presented in Fig. 2, overplotted\nwith the same cycles of the R52 model series. Each panel displays the visibilities at a given phase, using different symbols\nfor observations coming from different cycles (at least two per\npanel). The model reproduces the observations well at phases\n0.3-0.6, but not around visual maximum. Comparison with other\ncycles does not give better results. In fact, this reveals that\nthe model has larger cycle-to-cycle variations at pre-maximum\nphases than are seen in the observations. A closer look at the\nwavelength dependence shows that the discrepancy is least pronounced at 2.3 and 2.4 \u03bcm. Between 2.0 and 2.2 \u03bcm, the model\nshows very little wavelength-dependence, unlike the observations which show a clear decrease in visibility towards 2.0 \u03bcm.\nThis observation is supported by the more quantitative assessment presented in Figs. 3 and 4 (available electronically\nonly). Epochs with observations on at least two different baselines were selected, to resolve the degeneracy between CLV basic size and shape. Each of these data sets with good uv-coverage\nwas compared to each model, independently of model phase and\nfor a range of \u03b8R . The figures show the resulting \u03c72 -maps. In all\npanels a curved valley shows up: every data set can be fitted with\na model of any phase, albeit with a significantly larger diameter\nfor visual maximum models. However, within these valleys a\nbetter \u03c72 is typically found with a model at the correct (photometric) diameter but with a phase nearer to visual minimum than\nthe actual value of the observations. In conclusion, we find that\nthe models around visual maximum should resemble those of visual minimum more in CLV shape and wavelength-dependence.\nFinally, we also compared the observations to the similar o54\nmodel series, except for its luminosity. The results for o54 are\nalike and thus not shown here. The visibilities seem to match\nslightly better, but the light curve discrepancies become larger.\n\n7\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n\u03c6V\n\n. \u03bcm\n. \u03bcm\n. \u03bcm\n2.1\u03bcm\n2.0\u03bcm\n24\n\n0.6\n\n23\n22\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.6\n\n\u03c6V =0.0\n\n\u03c6V =0.1\n\n\u03c6V =0.2\n\n\u03c6V =0.3\n\n\u03c6V =0.4\n\n\u03c6V =0.5\n\n\u03c6V =0.6\n\n\u03c6V =0.7\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.6\n2\n\n1\n\n0.4\n\nV\n\n0\n\nFig. 1.

Discussion\nIreland et al. (2008) demonstrate that the CODEX models have\nreached a level of maturity, concerning computational issues and\ninput physics, that allows quantitative comparisons with observations. Pulsations are self-excited and molecular layers are produced naturally and in a physically self-consistent way.\nNevertheless, our observations of TU And show a clear discrepancy with the models around phases of visual maximum,\n3\n\n\fHillen et al.: Comparing the CODEX models to PTI time series of TU And\n1.8\n\u03c6V\n\n= 6.6\n\n\u03c6V\n\n= 7.8\n\n1.0\n\nlog \u03c72\n\nModel \u03c6\n\nV\n\n1.4\n\n3.5\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n\u22120.5\n\n0.6\n0.2\n\n\u22120.21.6 2.0 2.4 2.8 3.2 3.6 4.0 4.4 1.6 2.0 2.4 2.8 3.2 3.6 4.0 4.4\n\u03b8R\n\n(mas)\n\nFig. 3. The \u03c72 maps of two data sets with a good uv-coverage\n(see text). The log \u03c72 is shown as a function of Rosseland angular diameter and phase, of the same two model cycles as in\nFigs. 1 and 2. The phase of the data set is given in the upper\nright corner of the panel and is plotted as the horizontal dotted\nline. The vertical dotted line marks the photometric diameter.\nThe intersection of the dotted lines shows where the minimum\n\u03c72 should be if the model is correct.\n\nboth in the spectrum and in the visibilities. The most natural interpretation of the wavelength-dependence of this discrepancy\nseems to be in terms of the shape of the H2 O opacity curve,\nwhich shows an increase from 2.2 \u03bcm towards 2.0 and 2.4 \u03bcm.\nThe formation of H2 O layers depends sensitively on the density,\ntemperature, and pressure stratification in the upper atmosphere.\nIn the models, the conditions in the upper atmosphere are set\nby the dynamics. Shock fronts that emerge from the continuum\nphotosphere between phases -0.3 and -0.1 and then propagate\noutwards lead to the formation of an H2 O layer around phase\n0.2-0.3, which then strongly decreases in strength at phase 0.70.8. At \u03c6V = 0.5 both visibilities and spectra show good agreement. However, as demonstrated by Figs. 1, 2, and 3, the nearmaximum observations are represented better by model phases\nnearer to minimum, and thus with the presence of an H2 O layer\nin the atmosphere. This interpretation is supported by the better\nagreement at 2.3 and 2.4 \u03bcm. There CO is an important source\nof opacity, in the photosphere and in the extended atmosphere,\neven at visual maximum. As a much more stable molecule, CO\ndepends less on the exact conditions and partly hides the lack of\nan H2 O molecular layer in the spectrum and visibilities.\nIn retrospect, it is interesting to note that the image reconstruction of T Lep (P\u223c380d, Le Bouquin et al. 2009), made at a\nphase of 0.8-0.9, shows the clear signature of an extended molecular layer with a brightness ratio of \u223c10%, unlike its closest\nmodel series o54, which supports our findings. Woodruff et al.\n(2009) found fair agreement between the wavelength dependence of their measured 1.1-3.8 \u03bcm UDs and the predictions\nof the CODEX models, for several Miras at phases 0.5 to 0.8,\nbut needed slightly larger model continuum diameters than predicted. On the other hand, Wittkowski et al. (2011) have recently\ncompared AMBER medium spectral resolution observations of\nfour Miras to the CODEX models and found good agreement,\nalthough they compared the models to stars of a different period,\nhence luminosity.\nIn summary, at visual maximum the current models predict\na continuum photosphere that is too compact and hot as already\nsuggested by ISW11, in combination with too small an H2 O optical depth in the outer atmosphere, as found here.\nThe basic question now is, can this be salvaged within the\ncurrent modelling framework? Is it just a question of tuning the\nparameters to more realistic values? Following the discussion of\nISW11, it seems difficult to find any combination of parame4\n\nter values that fits all observables. Accepting the LMC periodluminosity relation and assuming that the effect of metallicity is\ninsufficient (see ISW11), the only free parameters are M, \u03b1m , and\n\u03b1\u03bd . Since the last mainly influences the pulsation amplitude, but\nnot the period or the 'parent star' radius, the above authors conclude that the problem at hand is one of calibrating the mixing\nlength parameter as a function of mass. Decreasing the rather\nhigh \u03b1m = 3.5 to a more 'realistic' value requires an increase\nin mass or a decrease in metallicity (albeit with a smaller dependency) to preserve the period, which would in case of o Cet\nbe inconsistent with its kinematically determined age. TU And\nthough, was classified as a member of a population with initial masses in the 1.15 \u2212 1.4 M\u2299 range and Z \u2208 [0.004, 0.02]\n(Mennessier et al. 2001), which makes it a better candidate to\ntest the above hypothesis.\nWe can at this point not gauge the impact of using an \u03b1\u03bd\nwhich is not tuned to the amplitude of TU And. As a result, we\nfeel that the model grid should span some scope in this parameter\nto allow more comparisons with 'small-amplitude' pulsators.\nCould either change in the model parameters also induce a\nstabilizing effect on the H2 O layer, as required by our observations, or is there a need to add more physics to the models?\n\n6. Conclusions\nThe combination of a spectro-photometric and interferometric\ntime series is a powerful tool for testing the validity of pulsating AGB model atmospheres, even at low spectral resolution.\nPTI observed a large sample of M-type Miras and semi-regulars,\nseveral with a similar sampling to the one presented here, covering periods between 150 and 470d. To fully exploit this rich\ndatabase, better coverage in the model parameter space is urgently needed, even though it requires a large computational effort. Only in this way can the model parameters be calibrated\nand (simply) linked to Mira observable properties. From the observational point of view, interferometric studies with better uvcoverage and spectral resolution should focus on phases 0.0 to\n0.15, since none of the current model series predicts any extended molecular atmosphere in that phase range.\nAcknowledgements.
