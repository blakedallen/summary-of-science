The disk resembles protoplanetary disks seen around ordinary\nyoung stars,6 suggesting the possibility of planet formation around young neutron stars.\nThe so-called anomalous X-ray pulsars7 (AXPs) are\n<\na group of young ( \u223c\n105 yr) neutron stars with spin\nperiods falling in a narrow range (5\u201312 s), no evidence\nfor binary companions, and whose X-ray luminosities\n(\u223c 1036 erg s\u22121 ) greatly exceed their rates of rotational\nkinetic energy loss (\u223c 1033 erg s\u22121 ). AXPs are generally believed to be 'magnetars',8 which are isolated neu> 1014 G) surface\ntron stars with exceptionally strong ( \u223c\nmagnetic field strengths and whose magnetic energy ultimately powers their X-ray emission. An alternative explanation for AXPs attributes their X-ray emission to accretion from a residual debris disk,9\u201311 but this model has\nhad difficulties explaining observations.12 The brightest\nknown AXP is the 8.7 s pulsar 4U 0142+61, at a distance\nof 3.9 kpc (ref. 13). Besides its X-ray emission, the pulsar also has known optical14 and near-infrared12 (near-IR)\ncounterparts.\nAs part of a systematic search for fallback disks\naround young neutron stars, we observed the field around\n4U 0142+61 in the 4.5 \u03bcm and 8.0 \u03bcm bands with the\nInfrared Array Camera (IRAC) on the Spitzer Space Telescope to look for the infrared excess predicted by models\nfor an X-ray heated fallback disk.15 We found a candidate\nmid-IR counterpart at the pulsar's position in both bands\n(Fig. 1) that has very unusual IR colours (Fig. 2). Based\non the position coincidence and colours, we conclude that\nwe have identified the mid-IR counterpart of 4U 0142+61.\nWe can reconstruct the observed low-energy spectral\nenergy distribution of 4U 0142+61 by combining our\nSpitzer data with existing IR and optical data12,16 (Fig.\n3). We may then infer the intrinsic spectrum by correcting for interstellar reddening. Although this reddening\n\ncorrection has little effect on the mid-IR data, it significantly affects the optical data. For any reasonable choice\nof reddening (2.6 < AV < 5.1; ref. 12), the optical and IR\ndata clearly arise from two different spectral components.\nThe optical (VRI) emission is consistent with a power-law\nspectrum,12 is pulsed at the spin period,17 and is presumably of magnetospheric origin; we will not consider this\ncomponent further but will instead confine ourselves to\nthe distinct IR component. Hereafter, we adopt the most\nlikely reddening value of AV = 3.5 (ref. 13).\nWe begin by noting that a non-thermal (self-absorbed\nsynchrotron) origin for the IR component can be ruled\nout, because associating the turnover near 4.5 \u03bcm with\na synchrotron self-absorption break requires an emission\nregion with an implausibly weak (\u223c 104 G) magnetic field\nstrength within a small (\u223c 100 km) radius of an active,\nhighly magnetized pulsar. Similarly, the shape of the\nIR spectrum suggests a thermal origin, but the simplest\ncase of a single-temperature (\u2243 920 K) blackbody gives\na mediocre fit to the data. Moreover, the only plausible\nblackbody source would be a large planet or extremely\nlow-mass stellar companion, but the implied blackbody\nemission radius (> 5R\u2299 , where R\u2299 is the solar radius) is\nmuch too large.\nA multi-temperature (700\u20131200 K) thermal model fits\nthe data better and thus naturally suggests an extended\ndisk or shell origin for the IR emission. We reject a shell\ngeometry as it would produce \u223c 1000 times the X-ray and\noptical absorption observed toward the AXP. As for a disk,\nit has already been shown that an accretion disk model\n(where the pulsar's X-ray flux is entirely powered by disk\naccretion onto the neutron star) is ruled out, as it greatly\n\n\f2\n\nWang, Chakrabarty, & Kaplan\n\nFigure\n\n2.\nInfrared\ncolour-colour\ndiagram\nfor 4U 0142+61 (diamond) and 33 field stars (small\ncrosses) from the 2MASS point source catalogue.

Disk gas could persist inside rin without\nany continuum emission at these temperatures, cooling instead by line emission. Alternatively, rin might also have\nbeen set by interactions with the pulsar magnetosphere at\nsome time in the past, which is consistent with the fact\nthat the pulsar's light cylinder radius (rLC = 0.61R\u2299 ) lies\nwell inside rin . The fit value of rin is sensitive to our choice\nof \u03b7d ; for \u03b7d = 0.5, the disk is further from the pulsar with\nrin \u2243 19 R\u2299 , although the fit quality is poorer.\nBy contrast, the uncertainty in rout is dominated by\nFigure 3.

For our fits, we fixed d = 3.9 kpc and cos i = 0.5 need an estimate of the disk's mass loss rate. For an upper\n\n\f4\n\nWang, Chakrabarty, & Kaplan\n\nlimit, we can interpret the pulsar's spin period derivative24\n(\u1e56 = 2 \u00d7 10\u221212) in terms of magnetic 'propeller' torques25\n\u22121\n< 10\u221211 M\n. (This presumes\nto argue that (\u2212\u1e40d ) \u223c\n\u2299 yr\nthat the disk gas penetrates inside rin and into the pulsar light cylinder to interact with the magnetosphere at\nthe corotation radius rco \u2243 0.01R\u2299.) The resulting disk\n> 106 yr is much longer than the\nlifetime \u03c4d = Md /|\u1e40d | \u223c\npulsar's spin-down age \u03c4p = P/2\u1e56 \u2248 105 yr, consistent\nwith a supernova fallback origin. This also suggests that\nthe disk did not start out with considerably more mass\nthan it currently contains.\nOur detection of a fallback disk is, to our knowledge,\nthe first direct evidence for supernova fallback in any context, and it thus bolsters the notion of fallback in a variety of other circumstances. For example, direct fallback\n(without a disk) in the seconds to hours following core collapse has been proposed as a mechanism for black hole formation following a supernova explosion,4 and may explain\nthe absence of a detectable pulsar in the nearby supernova\nSN 1987A. However, if a fallback disk forms around a new\nneutron star, there are several mechanisms that can limit\nthe disk lifetime,26,27 including accretion, magnetic propeller expulsion, and ablation by a pulsar wind, with the\ndetails depending upon the spin rate and magnetic moment of the neutron star. In addition, giant X-ray flares\nsuch as those seen in some magnetars28 may also severely\nlimit the lifetime of fallback disks. Our discovery implies\nthat it is possible for a disk to survive as long as 105 yr,\nalthough 4U 0142+61 may be an exceptional case.\nIf fallback disks are common around all young neutron stars, then pulsar spindown may be caused by diskmagnetosphere interactions in addition to magnetic dipole\ntorques, rendering traditional estimates of pulsar ages and\nmagnetic moments unrealiable.2,5 On the other hand, if\nfallback disks are peculiar to AXPs, this may point to\na distinct formation mechanism for magnetars. It may\nalso explain the narrow clustering of slow spin periods\nfor AXPs,10,11 despite the need for magnetar activity to\naccount for their X-ray flux. However, it is difficult to\ndiscriminate among these possibilities since there are few\nconstraints on the presence of disks around young pulsars. Previous searches, motivated by the discovery of a\npulsar planetary system,22 concentrated on middle-aged\nand old radio pulsars with no success.29 Our detection\nin 4U 0142+61 is probably due to a combination of the\nX-ray heating of the disk and the relative youth of the\npulsar (compared to \u03c4d ). We note that energetic particles in a radio pulsar wind may be as effective as X-rays\nat heating a disk, so that both X-ray and radio pulsars\nare promising targets, and additional debris disks may\nyet be detected in a suitably selected sample. However,\nthe strong non-thermal emission from a young pulsar or\nsupernova remnant may mask a disk signature in some\ncases.\nBy analogy with protoplanetary dust disks around\nordinary young stars,6 the presence of a debris disk\n\naround a neutron star naturally raises the possibility\nof planet formation. A debris disk is the presumed\norigin26,23 of the system of Earth-mass planets already\nknown to exist around the old (\u223c 109 yr) millisecond pulsar PSR B1257+12, which was detected through pulsar\ntiming residuals.22,23 However, millisecond pulsars are\ngenerally believed to have been spun up through sustained\ndisk accretion, and the formation and survival of a debris disk and planetary system in this context are difficult to explain.27 Our discovery does not directly address this system, but it does demonstrate that a debris\ndisk around a neutron star is indeed possible. Despite\nthis, it is not clear whether the radiation-rich environment around 4U 0142+61 is suitable for the formation\nand survival of planets.27 On the other hand, since planet\nformation probably requires \u223c 106 yr after the disk's formation,30 magnetar activity may well have subsided by\nthat time.8 In any case, searches for planets around young\npulsars are likely to be difficult. Pulsar timing searches\nfor planets will have poor sensitivity in AXPs owing to\ntheir slow spin periods, while timing noise in the fasterspinning young radio pulsars will limit sensitivity to planets in these systems.\nReceived 5 August 2005; Accepted 21 February 2006.\n\n1.\n\nColgate, S.
