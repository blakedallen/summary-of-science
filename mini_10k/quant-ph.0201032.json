Pahlke and W. Mathis\nInstitute TET, University of Hannover,\nAppelstr. 9A, 30167 Hannover, Germany\nAbstract\n\nWe present a scheme to generate arbitrary superposition of the Fock\nstates in a high-Q cavity . This proposal is based on a sequence of laser\npulses, which are tuned appropriately to control transitions on Fock state.\nIt is shown that N laser pulses are needed to generate a pure state with a\nphonon number limit N. PACS number(s): 03.67.-a, 03.67.Hk.\nThe generation of nonclassical states was extensively studied in the past theoretically\nand experimentally. The first significant advances were made in quantum optics by\ndemonstrating antibunched light [1] and squeezed light [2]. A number of scheme has\nbeen proposed for the purpose of generating various special nonclassical state[3]-[19]\nin context of cavity QED, trapped ion. In particular, several scheme for generating\narbitrary single mode quantum state[12]-[14] have also been proposed and generalized\nto generate arbitrary two mode quantum state[15]-[19]. Experimental realization of\nhighly nonclassical state, such as Fock states, squeezed and Schr\u00f6dinger cat states of\none dimensional vibrational motion of a trapped ion and cavity field have been reported\n[21, 20]. Among of the above schemes for single mode quantum state preparation\nN\nX\n\nn=0\n\nCn |n > .\n\n(1)\n\nthree basic schemes have been proposed. In the schemes proposed by Vogel et al [12],\nmeasurements have to be performed on the atom in order to generate a desired pure\nstate, which lead to finite probability of success. The probability of detecting atom in\nground state decrease with an increase in the photon numbers. The method described\nin Ref[13] is based on the adiabatic transfer of atomic ground state Zeeman coherence,\nso that the number of photon is limited by the number of available Zeeman levels. In\nRef[14], a appropriate time-dependent cavity QED interaction is designed to create the\ndesired field state, which need 2N operations to generate a pure state with a phonon\nnumber limit N. The reduction of the number of operation is important for further\nexperimental realization. Notice that the quantum state (1) involves N independent\ncomplex coefficients. The purpose of this paper is to present a scheme to generate\n1\n\n\fquantum state (1) with N quantum operations. We will show that each coefficient of\nquantum state (1) corresponds to only one laser pulse of this most efficient quantum\nstate generation scheme.\nIn order to describe our scheme, we consider the a high-Q cavity partially filled by a\nKerr medium with a series of coherent pulses injected into it, whose Hamiltonian is\ngiven by[7]\nH = \u2206\u03c9 a\u2020 a + \u03c7a\u20202 a2 + gei\u03c6 a\u2020 + ge\u2212i\u03c6 a\n(2)\nHere a\u2020 a and a are creative and annihilation operators. The parameters \u2206\u03c9 and \u03c7\ndescribe the detuning of the cavity from the driving frequency and the Kerr nonlinearity\nstrength, respectively. The \u03c6 and g are phase and amplitude of driving laser field,\nrespectively. From a practical point of view, parameter \u2206\u03c9 , \u03c6 and g are adjustable in\nthe experiment to give control over the cavity field. It is noticed that Kerr nonlinear has\nbeen used to generate Fock state from vacuum state in Ref[7]. Recently an optical Fockstate synthesizer was proposed to synthesize Fock state and their superpositions from\na coherent state[?]. Here we present a scheme to generate arbitrary quantum state(1)\nvia adjusting frequency of driving laser field. We choose frequency of laser driving field\nto make detuning \u2206\u03c9 to satisfy the condition \u2206\u03c9 = 2i\u03c7, i = 0, 1, * * * , N \u2212 1. Thus\nHamiltonian of the system can be written in the form\nH = \u03c7(a\u2020 a \u2212 i)(a\u2020 a \u2212 i \u2212 1) + gei\u03c6 a\u2020 + ge\u2212i\u03c6 a\n\n(3)\n\nHere we have neglected a constant term. Using the Fock state |n >, n = 0, 1 * * * the\nHamiltonian(3) take the form\nX\nX\u221a\nn + 1|n + 1 >< n|\nH=\n\u03c7(n \u2212 i)(n \u2212 i \u2212 1)|n >< n| + gi ei\u03c6i\nn\n\nn=0\n\n+gi e\u2212i\u03c6i\n\nX\u221a\n\nn + 1|n >< n + 1|\n\n(4)\n\nn=0\n\nIt is noticed that the coefficients of the Fock state |i > and |i + 1 > are equal to zero in\nthe first line of above equation. We now consider the condition \u03c7 >> Jg. In this case,\nwe apply the rotating wave approximation and discard the rapidly oscillating term in\nthe Hamiltonian (4) and obtain the effective interaction\n\u221a\n\nH = ei\u03c6i \u03a9i |i + 1 >< i| + e\u2212i\u03c6i \u03a9i |i >< i + 1|\n\n(5)\n\nhere \u03a9i = gi i + 1. In order to generate any superposition of Fock state(1), we consider\nthe situation in which the cavity field is prepared in the vacuum state\n\u03a8initial = |0 >\n\n(6)\n\nIn the following we show, that each term of equation(1) can be generated by one laser\npulse. Fist, we derive the cavity field with laser frequency \u2206\u03c9 = 0, after an interaction\ntime \u03c40 , the system evolves into\n\u03a81 = cos(\u03a90 \u03c40 )|0 > +i sin(\u03a90 \u03c40 )e\u03c60 |1 >\n\n(7)\n\nwe choose the amplitude (or interaction time \u03c40 ) of the laser field in such a way that\nthe following conditional are fulfilled\ncos(\u03a90 \u03c40 ) = C0\n2\n\n(8)\n\n\fwe obtain\n\u03c60\n\n\u03a81 = C0 |0 > +ie\n\nq\n\n1 \u2212 C02 |1 >\n\n(9)\n\nwithout loss of generality, we have assumed that C0 is a real number. We then tune\nthe laser frequency to satisfy \u2206\u03c9 = 2\u03c7. After an interaction time \u03c41 , the system is\nevolved into\nq\n\n\u03a82 = C0 |0 > +ie\u03c60 1 \u2212 C02 (cos(\u03a91 \u03c41 )|1 > +i sin(\u03a91 \u03c41 )e\u03c61 |2 >)\n\n(10)\n\nwe adjust the amplitude (or interaction time \u03c41 ) of the second laser field and phase of\nthe laser field of the first laser field to satisfy\nq\n\nie\u03c60 1 \u2212 C02 cos(\u03a91 \u03c41 ) = C1\n\n(11)\n\nthe state become\nq\n\n\u03a82 = C0 |0 > +C1 |1 > +i2 ei\u03c60 +i\u03c61 1 \u2212 C02 \u2212 |C1 |2 |2 >\n\n(12)\n\nIf this procedure is done for the m\u2212th time, the quantum state of the system is\n\u03a8m =\n\nm\u22121\nX\nl=0\n\nCl |l > +im exp(i\n\nm\u22121\nX\n\n\u03c6l\n\nv\nu\nm\u22121\nX\nu\n|C\n)t 1 \u2212\nl=0\n\nl=0\n\n1|\n\n2 |m\n\n(13)\n\n>\n\nWe now consider the (m + 1)\u2212th operation by choosing \u2206\u03c9 = 2m\u03c7. After interaction\n\u03c4m , the quantum state becomes\n\u03a8m+1 =\n\nm\u22121\nX\nl=0\n\nCl |J, l > +im exp(i\n\nm\u22121\nX\n\n\u03c6l\n\nl=0\n\nv\nu\nm\u22121\nX\nu\n|C\n)t 1 \u2212\nl=0\n\n1|\n\n2 (cos(\u03a9 \u03c4 )|m\nm m\n\n+i sin(\u03a9m \u03c4m )e\u03c6m |m + 1 >)\n\n>\n(14)\n\nWe choose the amplitude (or interaction time tm ) of the (m+1)-th laser pulse and phase\nof m-th laser field to satisfy\nim exp(i\n\nm\u22121\nX\nl=0\n\n\u03c6l\n\nv\nu\nm\u22121\nX\nu\nt\n|C\n) 1\u2212\nl=0\n\n1|\n\n2\n\ncos(\u03a9m \u03c4m ) = Cm\n\n(15)\n\nAfter the procedure is performed for N times the system's state definitely becomes\nstate(1).\nOne of the difficulties of our scheme in respect to an experimental demonstration consists in the requirement on the large Kerr coupling coefficient. Recently,two approaches\nhave been suggested to strongly enhance nonlinearlity- cavity quantum electrodynamics[22]\nand electromagnetically induced transparency[23]. These result indicate that giant\nKerr nonlinearlity can beobtained by methods not too far from present technology.\nRecently a experiment have been observed that decay time of cavity field is 0.2s[24],\nwhich is a long time enough time to to store field state. We present a scheme to generate arbitrary superposition of the Fock states of the electromagnetic field in high-Q\ncavity partially filled by a Kerr medium with a series of coherent pulses injected into\nit. This proposal is based on a sequence of laser pulses, which are tuned appropriately\nto control transitions on Fock state. It is shown that N laser pulses are needed to\ngenerate a pure state with a phonon number limit N.\n3\n\n\fReferences\n[1] See, for a review, H. Paul, Rev. Mod. Phys. 54, 1061 (1982); R.
