The QCD vacuum is one of the most complicated states filled not only by perturbative\nbut also strong nonperturbative fluctuations. In particular, the condensates of the quarks\nand gluons characterize its nonperturbative aspect. The quark condensate plays a role of\nan order parameter associated with spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking (S\u03c7SB) which is\nprobably one of the most important quantities for low-energy hadronic phenomena.\nThe presence of a constant external electromagnetic field F\u03bc\u03bd induces another type of\ncondensates leading to the nonzero magnetic susceptibility \u03c7f of the QCD vacuum defined\nas:\nh0|\u03c8f\u2020 \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd \u03c8f |0iF = ef \u03c7f hi\u03c8f\u2020 \u03c8f i0 F\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere ef denotes the quark electric charge, f is the corresponding flavor. It is natural\nto have the quark condensate hi\u03c8f\u2020 \u03c8f i0 in the chiral limit as a normalization factor in the\nright-hand side of Eq. (1), since S\u03c7SB is responsible for these quantities, i.e. the quark\ncondensate and magnetic susceptibility. In a recent paper [1] it was suggested that the\nmagnetic susceptibility \u03c7f may be measured in the exclusive photoproduction of hard dijets\n\u03b3 + N \u2192 (q\u0304q) + N. The value of \u03c7f was predicted by using the method of the QCD sum\nrule and vector dominance [2, 3, 4]: \u03c7f hi\u03c8f\u2020 \u03c8f i0 = 40 \u223c 70 MeV at the scale of 1 GeV.\nIn the present work, we want to investigate the magnetic susceptibility \u03c7f of the QCD\nvacuum within the framework of the instanton vacuum. Since the instanton vacuum explains\nS\u03c7SB naturally via quark zero modes, it may provide a good framework to study the \u03c7f .\nMoreover, there are only two parameters in this approach, namely the average instanton size\n\u03c1 \u2248 31 fm and average inter-instanton distance R \u2248 1 fm. The normalization scale of this\napproach can be defined by the average size of instantons and is approximately equal to \u03c1\u22121 \u2248\n0.6 GeV. The values of the \u03c1 and R were estimated many years ago phenomenologically by\nRef. [5] as well as theoretically by Ref. [6]. Furthermore, it was recently confirmed in various\nlattice simulations of the QCD vacuum [7, 8, 9]. Very recent lattice calculations of the quark\npropagator [10, 11] are in a remarkable agreement with that of Ref. [6].\nThe magnetic susceptibility of the QCD vacuum was estimated already in Ref. [20],\nhowever, done in the chiral limit and without the consideration of the current conservation.\nSince we want to investigate it beyond the chiral limit, we first need to extend Refs. [12,\n13, 14] and Lee-Bardeen formula [15] for a low-frequency (p \u226a \u03c1\u22121 ) part of the quark\ndeterminant:\nDetlow = det B, Bij = im\u0302\u03b4ij + aji , a\u2212+ = \u2212h\u03a6\u2212,0 |i/\u2202 |\u03a6+,0 i,\n\n(2)\n\ntaking into account the current quark mass. Here, m\u0302 denotes a current quark mass, which is\nassumed to be small, aij stands for the overlapping matrix element of the quark zero modes\n\u03a6\u00b1,0 generated by instantons (antiinstantons). In general, we define \u03a6\u00b1,n by the following\nequation:\n(i/\u2202 + /A\u00b1 )\u03a6\u00b1,n = \u03bbn \u03a6\u00b1,n ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere A\u03bc,\u00b1 is an instanton (antiinstanton) field and \u03bb0 = 0 by convention. The matrix\nelement aij is nonzero only between instantons and antiinstantons and vice versa due to\nspecific chiral properties of the zero modes.\nThe overlapping of the quark zero modes allows quarks to propagate through the\ninstanton-antiinstanton medium by jumping from one instanton to another one. Hence,\nDetlow is reduced to the determinant of the finite matrix B in the subspace of zero modes.\n2\n\n\fThis result was reproduced by Refs. [13, 16] in different ways. It is well known that the\nfermionic determinant is proportional to m|N+ \u2212N\u2212 | and strongly suppresses the fluctuations\nof |N+ \u2212 N\u2212 |. Therefore, we can take N+ = N\u2212 = N/2 in the final formulas.\nIn order to calculate the magnetic susceptibility, we have to find the light-quark partition\nfunction Z[V, T, m\u0302] in the presence of the Abelian external vector V\u03bc and antisymmetric\ntensor T\u03bc\u03bd fields. So, we first calculate a zero-mode approximated quark propagator S\u0303 in\nthe instanton ensemble and in the presence of these external fields. Using this propagator,\n \u0303 low and arrive at\nwe are able to compute a low-frequency part of the quark determinant Det\nthe extension of Eq. (2) for the non-zero m\u0302 with the external Abelian vector V and tensor\nT fields.\nThe smallness of the packing parameter \u03c0( R\u03c1 )4 \u2248 0.1 makes it possible to average the\ndeterminant over collective coordinates of instantons with fermionic quasiparticles, i.e. constituent quarks \u03c8 introduced. The averaged determinant turns out to be the light-quark\npartition function Z[V, T, m\u0302] which is a functional of V and T and can be represented by a\nfunctional integral over the constituent quark fields with the gauged effective chiral action\nS[\u03c8 \u2020 , \u03c8, V, T ]. However, it is not trivial to make the action gauge-invariant due to the nonlocality of the quark-quark interactions generated by instantons. In the previous paper [17],\nit was demonstrated how to gauge the nonlocal effective chiral action in the presence of\nthe external electromagnetic field. The gauged action was successfully tested by showing\nthat the low-energy theorem of the axial anomaly related to the process GG\u0303 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 (see also\n[18, 19]) is satisfied.\nIn the present work we refine the derivation of the gauged effective chiral action and\napply it to the calculations of the magnetic susceptibility \u03c7f of the QCD vacuum, taking\ninto account both current quark mass and nonlocal currents.\n2. It is clear that the magnetic susceptibility \u03c7f is related to the two-point correlation\nfunction of the quark tensor and vector currents at the zero momentum. In order to calculate\nthis correlation function, we need to treat the light-quark partition function Z[V, T, m\u0302] as\na functional of external abelian vector V\u03bc and tensor T\u03bc\u03bd fields. The relevant total quark\ndeterminant\n \u0303 := Det(i/\u2202 + /A + e/V + \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd T\u03bc\u03bd + im\u0302)\nDet\n\n(4)\n\ncan be splitted into two parts which correspond to low and high momenta, respectivley,\nwith respect to some auxiliary parameter M1 lying inside an interval, R\u22121 \u226a M1 \u226a \u03c1\u22121 :\n \u0303 = Det\n \u0303 low \u00d7 Det\n \u0303 high [12]. Det\n \u0303 high comes from fermion modes with Dirac eigenvalues from\nDet\n \u0303 low accounts for eigenvalues less than\nthe interval M1 to the Pauli\u2013Villars mass M, and Det\nM1 . The product of these determinants is independent of the scale M1 . However, we can\n \u0303 high can be written as a\ndeal with them only approximately. The high-momentum part Det\nproduct of the determinants in the field of individual instantons, while the low-momentum\n \u0303 low has to be treated approximately, would-be zero modes being only taken into\none Det\n \u0303 low depends weakly on M1 in the\naccount. In Ref. [12], it was demonstrated that the Det\nwide range, which serves as a check for this approximation. Based on this prescription, we\nnow calculate the low-momentum part of the quark determinant in the presence of instantons\nas well as external V\u03bc , T\u03bc\u03bd fields, and then average it over the collective coordinates of the\ninstantons in order to find the effective low-energy QCD partition function as a functional\nof the external field Z[V, T, m\u0302].\nWe first define the total quark propagator S\u0303 in the presence of the instanton ensemble A\nand external fields V , T and the quark propagator S\u0303i with a single instanton Ai as well as\n3\n\n\fV and T :\nS\u0303 =\n\n1\n,\ni/\u2202 + g/A + e/V + \u03c3 * T + im\u0302\n\nS\u0303i =\n\n1\n,\ni/\u2202 + g/Ai + e/V + \u03c3 * T + im\u0302\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03c3 * T = \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd T\u03bc\u03bd . We assume that the total instanton field A may be approximated\nPN\nas a sum of the single instanton fields, A =\ni=1 Ai , which is justified with the abovementioned average size of instantons \u03c1 \u2248 1/3 fm and average inter-instanton distance R \u2248\n1 fm.

Since the range of the integration in Eq.(28) is truncated at \u03c1,\nwhich is defined by zero-mode functions \u03a6\u00b1,0 , the range of the nonlocality is determined by\n\u03c1.\nNote that the external vector field V\u03bc gauges not only the kinetic term of the effective\naction but also its interaction one \u1e7c\u00b1,f [\u03c8f\u2020 , \u03c8f ] in Eq. (28). The reason is clear: Since the\ninstanton-induced interaction is nonlocal, the gauge connection Lf must be attached to\neach fermionic line so that the effective action may be gauge-invariant. Unfortunately, we\nencounter an ambiguity arising from this gauge connection, since it is path-dependent in\ngeneral. However, we will show now that the most preferable path can be found in the\npresent case.\n3. In order to solve the problem of gauge dependence due to the nonlocal interaction\ninduced by instantons, we have employed the gauge connection Lf . Though it causes in\ngeneral some arbitrariness due to its path dependence, we can prove that such dependence\ncan be minimized in the present work. To be more specific, we consider the extended zero\nmode:\n(1)\n\n(i/D + /V )|\u03a6\u03030 i = 0, i/D = i/\u2202 + /A, |\u03a6\u03030 i = |\u03a60 i \u2212 SN Z /V |\u03a60 i,\n6\n\n(29)\n\n\f(1)\n\nwhere A denotes an instanton field located at z, |\u03a6\u03030 i stands for the solution to order\nO(V ), and SN Z the well-known non-zero mode of the propagator in the instanton field\n(see the review [5] and references therein). Putting the gauge connection L(x, z) defined in\nEq. (9) into Eq. (29), we obtain:\n(i/D + /V \u2032 )|\u03a6\u20320 i = 0, V\u03bc\u2032 = L\u22121 (i\u2202\u03bc + V\u03bc )L, |\u03a6\u20320 i = L\u22121 (x, z)|\u03a6\u03030 i.\n\n(30)\n\n(1)\u2032\n\ni/D |\u03a60 i = 0 and SN Z i/D = 1 \u2212 |\u03a60 ih\u03a60 | being used, the solution |\u03a60 i to order O(V ) in\n(1)\nEq. (30) can be reduced to the corresponding solution |\u03a6\u03030 i to order O(V ) without any\ntrace of the path dependence arising from the gauge connection L.\nHowever, if the zero-mode approximation SN Z \u2248 1 = S00 is used to find the solution to\ni\u2202\n/\norder O(V )\n(1)\u2032\n\n|\u03a600 i = |\u03a60 i \u2212 S00 /V \u2032 |\u03a60 i,\n\n(31)\n\nthen applying the inverse gauge connection L\u22121 to Eq.(31) leads to\nZ\n(1)\n|\u03a6\u030300 i = |\u03a60 i \u2212 S00 /V |\u03a60 i + S00 (i d\u03be\u03bc V\u03bc (\u03be))|\u03a60 i,\n\n(32)\n\nwhich depends on the path we choose explicitly. Thus, it is the best way that we choose the\n(1)\n(1)\npath minimizing k\u03a6\u03030 \u2212 \u03a6\u030300 k2 . Expressing the external vector field in a Fourier form:\nZ\nV\u03bc (x) = d4 qV\u03bc (q)eiq*x ,\n(33)\nwe can parameterize the path from x to z as follows:\n\u03be\u03bc (x, z, t) = z\u03bc + (x \u2212 z)\u03bc t + p\u03bc (x, z, t)\n\n(34)\n\nwith parameter t \u2208 (0, 1) and boundary conditions p\u03bc (t = 0) = p\u03bc (t = 1) = 0. It is the\nmost optimized path we can take, since p\u03bc should depend only on the path difference x \u2212 z\nin order to satisfy the conservation of the linear momenta. More explicitly, we write down\nthe path in the following form:\n\u03be\u03bc (x, z, t) = z\u03bc + (x \u2212 z)\u03bc t + p\u03bc t(1 \u2212 t).\nThen we have\nZ\nZ\nZ\n4\niq*z\ni d\u03be\u03bc V\u03bc (\u03be) = i d qV\u03bc (q)e\n\n(35)\n\n1\n\ndt[(x \u2212 z)\u03bc + (1 \u2212 2t)p\u03bc ]eiq*[(x\u2212z)t+ipt(1\u2212t)] .\n\n(36)\n\n0\n\nIn principle, we can express Eq. (36) in terms of the error function. However, we shall\nconsider a simple case of q\u03c1 \u226a 1 so that we can expand the vector current with respect to\n(q * p) and q * (x \u2212 z):\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\nZ\n(q * (x \u2212 z))2\n4\niq*x\n4\niq*z\n(37)\n1 + iq * (x \u2212 z) \u2212\nV\u03bc (x) = d qV\u03bc (q)e \u2248 d qV\u03bc (q)e\n2\n7\n\n\fSubstituting this expansion into Eqs. (29) and (32) and carrying out some tedious but\nstraightforward calculations, we obtain\nZ\n(1)\n(1) 2\n2\nk\u03a6\u03030 \u2212 \u03a6\u030300 k \u2248 C\u03c1 Nf d4 qV 2 (q)(q * p)2 + * * *\n(38)\nwhere the constant C = +0.0063 > 0 and higher-order terms are neglected. Therefore, we\ncan conclude that the minimum is achieved by taking the straight-line path that will be\nemployed in the sequel.\nMoreover, since we are only interested in the case of a constant electromagnetic field\nstrength F\u03bc\u03bd , we can even show that the magnetic susceptibility does not depend at all on\nthe path. Let us consider the following difference:\n\u0012Z x\n\u0013\nZ\nZ\n\u03b4\nd\u03be\u03bc V\u03bc (\u03be) :=\nd\u03be\u03bc V\u03bc (\u03be) \u2212\nd\u03be\u03bc V\u03bc (\u03be),\n(39)\nz\n\nC\n\ns\u2212l\n\nR\n\nwhere C d\u03be\u03bc V\u03bc (\u03be) is the line\nR integral along the path C parameterized by \u03be\u03bc (x, z, t) = z\u03bc +\n(x\u2212z)\u03bc t+a\u03bc (x\u2212z, t) and s\u2212l d\u03be\u03bc V\u03bc (\u03be) is calculated along the straight-line. This difference is\nreducible to the integral over the surface between these two contours due to Stoke's theorem:\n\u03b4\n\n\u0012Z\n\nz\n\nx\n\nd\u03be\u03bc V\u03bc (\u03be)\n\n\u0013\n\n:=\n\nI\n\nd\u03be\u03bc V\u03bc (\u03be) =\n\nI\n\ndS\u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd (\u03be) = F\u03bc\u03bd\n\nZ\n\nd\u03be\u03bc a\u03bd (\u03be),\n\n(40)\n\nR\nwhere the integral d\u03be\u03bc a\u03bd (\u03be) depends only on a distance R(x\u2212z) but not on x and z separately\ndue to translational invariance. Denoting G\u03bc\u03bd (x \u2212 z) \u2261 d\u03be\u03bc a\u03bd (\u03be)F (x \u2212 z), where F (x \u2212 z)\nrepresents the form factor F in coordinate space, we find that the change of the magnetic\nsusceptibility \u03b4\u03c7f due to the deformation of the contour turns out to vanish:\nF\u03bb\u03c1 Tr[S(p)G\u03c1\u03bb (p)F (p)S(p)\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd + S(p)F (p)G\u03c1\u03bb (p)S(p)\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd ] = 0.\n\n(41)\n\nThus, we are now allowed to take any path without changing the final results of the magnetic\nsusceptibility.\n4. We are now in a position to derive the relevant partition function for the magnetic susceptibility of the QCD vacuum. We first have to average the low-frequency part of the quark\n \u0303 low over collective coordinates \u03be\u00b1 . Having exponentiated and bosonized the\ndeterminant det\ninteraction terms [12, 13, 17, 25, 26], we arrive at the effective chiral action with external\nfields pertinent\nto the magnetic susceptibility. Since the density of the instanton medium\n\u0001\n2 \u03c1 4\n(\u03c0 R \u2248 0.1) is low, we are able to average over positions and orientations of the instantons independently. In the next step we have to introduce auxiliary fields, i.e. the couplings\n\u03bb\u00b1 for exponentiation and meson fields \u03a6\u00b1 (x) for bosonization, respectively. Having integrated over fermion fields, we end up with the partition function in the presence of the\nexternal vector and tensor fields:\nZ\nZ[V, T, m\u0302] = d\u03bb+ d\u03bb\u2212 D\u03a6+ D\u03a6\u2212 exp (\u2212S[\u03bb\u00b1 , \u03a6\u00b1 ]) ,\n(42)\n\n8\n\n\fwhere\nS[\u03bb\u00b1 , \u03a6\u00b1 ] = \u2212\n\nX\n\u00b1\n\nS\u03a6 =\n\nZ\n\n\"\n\nd4 x\n\nN\u00b1 ln\n\nX\n\n(\u0012\n\n4\u03c0 2 \u03c12\nNc\n\n\u0013Nf\n\n\u2212 N 1\u22121\n\n(Nf \u2212 1)\u03bb\u00b1\n\nf\n\nN\u00b1\nV \u03bb\u00b1\n\n)\n\n#\n\n\u2212 N\u00b1 + S\u03a6 + S\u03c8 ,\n\n(43)\n\n1\n\n(det \u03a6\u00b1 (x)) Nf \u22121 ,\n\n\u00b1\n\n1 \u00b1 \u03b35\n)F (P )(/P + \u03c3 * T + im\u0302)\u22121 ).\n2\n\u00b1\nR\nHere, P\u03bc = p\u03bc + eV\u03bc , p\u03bc = i\u2202\u03bc and Tr stands for the functional trace, i.e. d4 xtrc trD trf\nand F (k) denotes the quark form factor generated by the fermionic zero modes and has an\nexplicit form as follows [12]:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nF (k \u03c1\u0304) = 2z I0 (z)K1 (z) \u2212 I1 (z)K0 (z) \u2212 I1 (z)K1 (z) ,\n(44)\nz\nS\u03c8 = \u2212Tr ln((/P + \u03c3 * T + im\u0302 + iF (P )\n\nX\n\n\u03a6\u00b1 (x)\n\nwhere I0 , I1 , K0 , and K1 are the modified Bessel functions, z is defined as z = k \u03c1\u0304/2. When\nk goes to infinity, this zero-mode form factor F (k \u03c1\u0304) has the following asymptotic behavior:\nF (k \u03c1\u0304) \u2212\u2192\n\n6\n.\n(k \u03c1\u0304)3\n\n(45)\n\nIn fact, the nonlocal effective quark-meson interaction can be understood without relying\non the instanton vacuum [23]. In those cases, the momentum-dependent quark mass can be\ninterpreted as a nonlocal regularization in Euclidean space. Hence, various types of the F (k)\nas a regulator with the regularization parameter \u039b \u223c 1/\u03c1\u0304 has been used by different authors.\nFor example, the dipole-type F (k) is adopted in the study of the pion wave function [20],\nwhile the Gaussian is employed in Ref. [24]. Hence, we utilize in this work the dipole and\nexponential types of the form factors in addition to the instanton-induced zero-mode form\nfactor:\n\u001a 2\n\u039b /(\u039b2 + k 2 ) (dipole),\n(46)\nF (k) =\nexp(\u2212k 2 /\u039b2) (Gaussian).\nThe saddle-point approximation of the integrals in the partition function given in Eq.\n(42) leads to the equation for the effective quark mass, which is in general expressed by the\nfunctional of the external fields V and T . However, since we finally need the term of order\nO(V T ), we can consider the saddle-point approximation without external fields:\n\u03a6\u00b1,f g = \u03a6\u00b1,f g (0) = Mf \u03b4f g , \u03bb\u00b1 = \u03bb =\n\n2V Y\nMf ,\nN f\n\nwhich satisfies the following saddle-point equation\nZ\nd4 k Mf F 2 (k)(mf + Mf F 2 (k))\nN\n= 4Nc\n.\nV\n(2\u03c0)4 k 2 + (mf + Mf F 2 (k))2\n\n(47)\n\n(48)\n\nEquation (48) contains the momentum-dependent dynamic quark mass Mf (k) = Mf F 2 (k).\nNote that the dynamic quark mass Mf is a decreasing function of the current quark mass\n9\n\n\fmf [25, 26] with meson loops neglected. At small mf , we may write Mf = M0 + \u03b3mf with\nM0 \u2248 360 MeV and \u03b3 \u2248 \u221221 .\nHaving derived the partition function in Eq. (43), we are now ready for the calculation of\nthe magnetic susceptibility \u03c7f from the instanton vacuum within our framework. In order\nto evaluate \u03c7f , we have to compute the following correlation function via the functional\nderivative with respect to the external tensor field:\n\u03b4\nln Z[V, T, m\u0302]\n\u03b4T\u03bc\u03bd\n\n= h0|\u03c8 + \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd \u03c8|0iF = Tr(S\u0303\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd )\n\n(49)\n\nT =0\n\nwith\nS\u0303 =\n\n1\n.\n/P + im\u0302 + iM(P )\n\n(50)\n\nWe shall consider here only the leading order in the large Nc expansion. Using the Schwinger\nmethod [21, 22], we solve the following traces:\n\u0013\n\u001b\n\u001a\u0012\n1\n1\n\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd\n\u2212\nTr\n\u001a\u0012/P + i(m\u0302 + M(P )) /P + im\u0302\n\u0013\n\u001b\n(m\u0302 + M(p))\nm\u0302\n\u03c3*F\n= iTr\n\u2212 2\n\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd\n2\n2 2\n2\n(p + m\u03022 )\u001b\n2\n\u001a (p + (m\u0302 + M(p)) )\n1\n/p[/P , M(P )]\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd ,\n(51)\n+ iTr\n(p2 + (m\u0302 + M(p))2 )2\nwhere \u03c3 * F = \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd . We need to calculate the commutator [/P , M(P )], keeping only terms\nto order O(V ). It can be easily computed for the dipole-type form factor. Otherwise, we\ncan derive them numerically. Finally, we arrive at the following expression for the magnetic\nsusceptibility:\n!\nZ\n4\nd\np\nm\nm\n+\nM\n(p)\nf\nf\nf\n\u03c7f hi\u03c8f\u2020 \u03c8f i0 = 4Nc\n\u2212\n(2\u03c0)4 (p2 + (mf + Mf (p))2 )2 (p2 + m2f )2\nZ\nMf F (p)F \u2032 (p)p\nd4 p\n,\n(52)\n\u2212 4Nc\n(2\u03c0)4 (p2 + (mf + Mf (p))2 )2\nwhere the quark condensate in the chiral limit plays a role of the normalization and is given\nby:\nZ\nd4 p\nM0 F 2 (p)\n\u2020\nhi\u03c8 \u03c8i0 = 4Nc\n\u2248 0.017 GeV3 ,\n(53)\n(2\u03c0)4 p2 + M02 F 4 (p)\nThe infrared region of the first integral in Eq.(52) brings out the contribution of order\nO(mf ln mf ) which is almost model-independent. In order to calculate the magnetic susceptibility explicitly, we first consider two different regions while integrating: 0 < p < 1 GeV\nand 1 GeV < p < \u221e. Then we are able to evaluate a part of the free quark analytically. The\n1\n\nOur preliminary estimate indicates that the contribution of the meson loops to the dynamic quark mass\nis not at all small due to the chiral log corrections which are of order N1c mf ln mf . The meson-loop\ncorrections are even more important than those of order O(mf ).\n\n10\n\n\f50\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\nlocal\n........... ........... ........... ........... ...........\n...\n...\nf\n...\n...\n...\nnonlocal\n...\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n...\nf\n...\n...\n...\n...\ntotal\n...\n........................................................................\n...\nf\n...\n...\n...\n...\n....\n...\n....\n....\n....\n...\n...\n....\n...\n.....\n.\n....\n...\n.....\n...\n.....\n.\n.....\n.....\n...\n.....\n...\n.....\n.....\n.\n.....\n...\n......\n...\n......\n..\n......\n...\n......\n....\n......\n.\n......\n......\n....\n.......\n....\n.......\n.......\n...... ..\n.....\n.......\n.... ....\n.\n.\n...\n.......\n.. ......\n........\n.....\n...... ..\n........\n.... ..... ......\n........\n. ...... .\n........\n.......... ..\n.........\n.... .... ......\n.........\n...... .....\n......\n.........\n. ...... .\n.....\n..........\n..... ......\n......\n..........\n...... ......\n.....\n...........\n...... ......\n...........\n.......\n...... ......\n............\n....\n...... ...... ..\n..........\n........\n.... ...... ......\n... .\n...... ...... ...... ...........................\n.........\n...... ...... ........................\n. ....\n...... ........................\n.......\n..\n..........\n. ......\n..... ...\n........ .\n.......... .\n.......... ..\n......... .....\n...... ..........\n. ........... ....\n....... ........... ....\n....... ...........\n\n\u03c7\n\n\u03c7f hi\u03c8f\u2020 \u03c8f i0 [MeV]\n\n40\n\n\u03c7\n\n\u03c7\n\n30\n20\n10\n\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\nmf [MeV]\n\n150\n\n200\n\nFIG. 1: The mf dependence of the magnetic susceptibility with the form factor of the zero-mode\ntype (Eq.

The solid curve represents the total\nmagnetic susceptibility as a function of the current quark mass.\n\nsecond integral in Eq. (52) is related to the nonlocal contribution without which the vector\ncurrent is not conserved, i.e. the Ward-Takahashi identity is broken. It arises from the\nnonlocal quark-quark interaction and is called nonlocal current. Summing all contributions,\nwe obtain the final result for the magnetic susceptibility of the QCD vacuum at q 2 = 0:\n\u03c7f = \u03c7local\n+ \u03c7nonlocal\nf\nf\n\n(54)\n\nwith\n\u03c7local\nhi\u03c8f\u2020 \u03c8f i0\nf\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\n3 mf\nmf\n29 + 0.103mf +\nln\n2\n2\u03c0\n1000 MeV\n\n\u03c7nonlocal\nhi\u03c8f\u2020 \u03c8f i0 = (18 \u2212 0.095mf ) [MeV].\nf\n\n\u0013\n\n[MeV],\n\n(55)\n(56)\n\nIn principle, we can also derive the magnetic susceptibility at finite q 2 , i.e. the form factor\nof the magnetic susceptibility of the QCD vacuum.\n5. Figure 1 shows the magnetic susceptibility \u03c7f hi\u03c8f\u2020 \u03c8f i0 as a function of the current\nquark mass, with the zero-mode form factor in Eq. (44) employed. It is a monotonically\ndecreasing function as mf increases, since the third term with mf ln mf in Eq. (55) suppresses\nthe first and second ones noticeably as mf gets larger. In fact, its value is around \u22124.0 MeV\nfor up and down quark masses mu,d \u2243 5 MeV, whereas for the strange quark mass ms \u2243 200\nMeV it turns out to be \u221249 MeV. Thus, it almost cancels the leading term in the case of\nthe strange magnetic susceptibility \u03c7s . Moreover, the nonlocal part is responsible for about\n40% of the total magnetic susceptibility in the chiral limit and diminishes linearly but slowly\nas mf increases. It implies that it is essential to treat the vector current properly in the\npresence of the nonlocal interaction, in particular, in the case of the magnetic susceptibility.\nAs a result, the magnetic susceptibility for the up and down quarks is: \u03c7u,d = 40 \u223c 45 MeV,\nwhereas for the strange quark we obtain \u03c7s = 6 \u223c 10 MeV. As for the up and down quarks,\nthe present result is comparable to that of Ref.

The solid curve is drawn with\nthe zero-mode form factor (44), while the long-dashed one depicts the dipole-type form factor. The\nshort-dashed one is for the Gaussian form factor.\n\nA comparison between different types of the form factors is depicted in Fig. 2. As already\ndiscussed in Refs. [27, 28, 29], the exponential type of the form factor yields the smallest\nresult as usual. It is interesting to see that the dipole type presents a very similar result for\nthe magnetic susceptibility to that with the zero-mode form factor (44). It is also found that\nthe dependence of the magnetic susceptibility on a type of the form factors is not sensitive.\n6. In the present work, we have investigated the magnetic susceptibility of the QCD\nvacuum within the framework of the nonlocal chiral quark model from the instanton vacuum.\nWe first have constructed the effective partition function in the presence of the external\nvector and tensor fields as well as the current quark mass. It was shown that for the constant\nelectromagnetic field strength the present result is independent of the path which is selected\nfor the gauge connection. We found that the result is a smoothly decreasing function of mf :\n\u2020\nFor the up and down quarks mu,d \u2243 5 MeV we have \u03c7u,d hi\u03c8u,d\n\u03c8u,d i0 = 40 \u223c 45 MeV and for\n\u2020\nthe strange quark we obtain \u03c7s hi\u03c8s \u03c8s i0 = 6 \u223c 10 MeV. As for the up and down quarks the\npresent results are comparable to the estimate of the vector dominance and QCD sum rule\napproach [2, 3, 4].\nThe present work is supported by Korea Research Foundation Grant (KRF-2003-041C20067).
