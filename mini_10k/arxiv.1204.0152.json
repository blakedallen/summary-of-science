This approach will be a powerful tool for the interpretation\nof recent conductance measurements of molecular wires.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe study of electron transport through nanostructures has been a primary interest in the field of molecular electronics in the last few decades. Recently, increasing attention has been paid to the main role played\nby phase-breaking processes in molecular junctions. [1\u2013\n5] The transition from coherent (tunneling) to incoherent (hopping) regimes is one example of such a process\nwhich provides helpful information for the fundamental\nunderstanding of transport mechanisms and for applications such as organic semiconductors. Such transitions\nhave commonly been reported in many studies of electron\ntransfer in molecular systems and electron transport in\nmolecular junctions, for instance, self-assembled monolayers, [6, 7] polymers, [6\u201311] and macromolecules such\nas proteins, [12] DNAs, [13] and organic semiconductors.\n[8]\nFor further development of molecular devices, the intrinsic mechanisms of charge transport including the dephasing effects and influential factors such as thermal\nfluctuations need to be understood in detail. In order\nto evaluate the electronic conductance of nanostructures,\nthe Landauer formula is commonly used. However, this\nmethod is restricted to address systems within the coherent regime. In principle, this method must be extended\nbefore it can be applied to organic semiconductors or disordered polymers where the dephasing effects play an essential role in electron transport. Normally, many molecular aggregates widely used in organic semiconductor devices exhibit high disorder features. A proper theoretical\ndescription of the transport properties of such defective\nstructures has to take into account not only band-like\ncoherence but also dephasing mechanisms via a hopping\nrepresentation. [14]\n\nOne of the main sources of dephasing processes is\nthe interaction between electronic states and molecular vibrations, referred as electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling. The e-ph interactions can be experimentally inferred from inelastic tunneling spectroscopy or from thermal resonance broadening. The challenge, then, concentrates in incorporating e-ph interactions into the Landauer approach. The current state of the art as followed\nby several theoretical works involves the use of density\nfunctional theory (DFT) within nonequilibrium Green's\nfunction formalism where e-ph interaction is modeled by\nself-energy terms that can be solved self-consistently. [15]\nHowever, such a strategy can be computationally demanding. Such limitations can compromise the understanding of the main role played by dephasing effects\non the charge transport properties of molecular devices,\nleading to the search for less expensive models that attend to more qualitative interpretations. One example\nof such a model is B\u00fcttiker's scattering approach, [1, 16]\nin which e-ph coupling is replaced by phenomenological\nvoltage probes capable of inducing phase-breaking process into the molecular conductor.\nOther approaches using reduced density matrix elements where their time evolution can be described by\nRedfield equation have also been adopted to describe the\nphysics of electron transfer/transport in molecular systems and their crossover trends between coherent and\nincoherent regimes. [17\u201319] Nevertheless, it is highly\ndesired to investigate such a prominent physical phenomenon using a parameter-free (or using as few parameters as possible) first principles methodology since a more\ndetailed quantitative study can be rendered using such\ntechniques. Such tecniques would enable us to investigate the relationship between the conformational change\nof a realistic molecule and the change of electron transport.\n\n\f2\nIn this letter, we analyzed the main role played\nby dephasing effects in the transport behaviour of organic polymer systems using the Hamiltonian version of\nB\u00fcttiker's scattering approach which is the D'AmatoPastawski model. [20] We show that the conductance\nof the molecules can be dramatically modified due to the\ndephasing effect depending on the size of the molecules.\nImportant fundamental questions such as the tunnelingto-hopping transition and influence of thermal fluctuation on transport are also addressed in this work. We\ndemonstrate that dephasing has a significant impact in\ndriving the transport regime of molecular systems from\na quantum mechanical tunneling to Ohmic behaviour for\nlonger molecular wires.\n\nFIG. 1. (a) A schematic model of a molecular junction\nconnected between two electrodes. B\u00fcttiker probes are introduced to simulate dephasing events. (b) PPV- and (c)\npyrrole-oligomer is coupled to electrodes consisted of graphene\nnanoribbons (GNRs) via peptide linkers.\n\nTHEORETIACAL FRAMEWORK\n\nWe calculated the conductance of molecular wires using the Landauer formula written in terms of Green's\nfunctions. [21] Figure 1(a) shows a schematic picture\nof the studied system which is composed of a two terminal conducting channel connected to a central scattering region. A sequence of local dephasing probes is\nincorporated to describe incoherent events that affect\nthe transport properties of the system. The electronic\nstructure of the molecular wires is represented by a tightbinding Hamiltonian; H = HL + VL + HM + VR + HR ,\nwhere HL/R and HM represent the left/right electrode\nand central contributions, respectively. VL/R defines the\n\ncoupling between source/drain electrodes and the molecular wire. The electronic propagator for the coupled\nsystem is represented by a retarded Green's function\ndefined as GR (E) = [(E + i\u03b7)I \u2212 HM \u2212 \u03a3L \u2212 \u03a3R ]\u22121 ,\nwhere \u03a3L/R are the self-energy elements which include\nthe influence of the contacts. The conductance of a 1D\nmolecule at low bias in the coherent regime is then obtained via Landauer's formula, G = G0 Tr[GR \u0393L GA \u0393R ]\n2\nwhere G0 is the quantum conductance unit G0 = 2 eh\nand \u0393L/R represents the broadening function given by\n\u0393L/R (E) = i[\u03a3L/R (E) \u2212 \u03a3\u2020L/R (E)].\nTo include dephasing events in the model, the\nD'Amato-Pastawski formalism is adopted. Within this\npicture, one includes additional self-energy terms that\naccount for the dephasing processes. This function is\ndefined as GR\neff (E) = [(E + i\u03b7)I \u2212 HM \u2212 \u03a3L \u2212 \u03a3R \u2212\nPN\n\u22121\n, where N is the number of reservoirs\nn=1 \u03a3B,n ]\nand \u03a3B,n are the self-energies due to B\u00fcttiker probes;\n\u03a3B,n = i\u03b3e-ph /2 that is written in term of a dephasing\nparameter, \u03b3e-ph , associated to the e-ph coupling.\nThe effective conductance is given by Teff = TL,R +\nPN\n\u22121\nm,n=1 TL,m Wm,n Tn,R , where TL,R describes the coherent contribution and the subsequent term takes into account the incoherent events. W is a Markov matrix\nformed by transmission Tm,n between the m-th and nPN\nth probes, and the reflection Rm = 1 \u2212 n6=m Tm,n , defined as Wm,n = \u03b4m,n (1 \u2212 Rm ) \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b4m,n )Tm,n . The\nbroadening caused by dephasing processes is defined as\n\u0393m \u2261 i[\u03a3B,m \u2212 \u03a3\u2020B,m ] = \u03b3e-ph which is related to the\ndephasing rate, k = \u0393m /~. Although the dephasing\nstrength \u03b3e\u2212ph can be evaluated by the Fermi Golden\nrule quantitatively from first principles, which are comparable to kB T , [3, 22] it is also possible to examine the\ninfluence of the dephasing events on charge transport by\nchanging the rate of dephasing events.\n\nRESULT AND DISCUSSION\n\nFirstly, it is important to obtain the electronic transmission within the coherent regime in order to compare\nit to the incoherent cases. We chose two sample systems for such analysis: PPV- [Fig. 1(b)] and pyrroleoligomer [Fig. 1(c)] polymers. At first, we use a simple\ntigh-binding model, which only considers the nearestneighboring \u03c0-orbitals in order to capture the trend of\nthe transmission profiles. The coupling strength of C-C\nbonds on the GNR electrodes [23] are simply parameterized as \u03b2 = 2.66 eV. In the scattering region, the transfer\nintegrals for double and single bonds are set as \u03b2d = 1.2\u03b2\nand \u03b2s = 0.8\u03b2, respectively, and the on-site energies for\neach atom are \u01eb2p = 0.0\u03b2 (C), 0.902\u03b2 (N), and 1.902\u03b2\n(O). [24] The Fermi energy of the systems are set to 0.0\u03b2\nfor simplicity. The coherent transmission results are displayed in Fig. 2 for (a) PPV- and (c) pyrrole-based molec-\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 2. Electronic transmission calculated for PPV- (upper panels) and pyrrole- (lower panels) based molecular wires as a\nfunction of the molecular length within tight binding approximation. Results are displayed within coherent [(a) and (c)] and\nincoherent [(b) and (c)] regimes assuming also different dephasing parameters.\n\nular wires considering different lengths. The transport response of the systems is characterized by a transmission\nvalley centered around the Fermi energy (EF = 0.0\u03b2).\nSuch valleys become more pronounced as the molecular\nlength increases and this results in the well-known exponential decay of the conductance at the Fermi level as\nshown in the logarithm plots of Fig. 2 (b) and (d) (red\nlines).\nDephasing effects are subsequently included in the\nmodel and we investigate how they affect the conductance behaviour as a function of molecular length. Bearing in mind that the e-ph coupling is much weaker than\nthe transfer integrals, [25] we finely changed the dephasing parameters between 0.5 and 20 m\u03b2 and studied their\ninfluence on the charge transport as shown in Figs. 2 (b)\nand (d). One can see that the transmission is considerably enhanced in comparison to the coherent tunneling\nas the length of the molecule increases. A clear deviation\nfrom exponential behaviour can be observed which becomes more evident with increasing dephasing strength.\nMore sophisticated methods such as the density functional based tight-binding (DFTB) approach [26, 27]\nwere also employed to verify the robustness of such\ncrossover behavior. We relaxed the molecular junctions\nand calculated the transmission in the same way as ref\n[28]. At first, we relaxed the isolated molecular wires and\n1D GNRs individually. Then we coupled the relaxed isolated molecular wires between the single unit cells of the\n\nrelaxed 1D GNR electrodes. We relaxed them using periodic boundary conditions fixing the atoms at the boundaries. After the relaxation, we placed the relaxed coupled systems between the relaxed 1D semi-infinite GNR\nelectrodes and calculated the transmission probabilities\nusing the same approach.\nThe Fermi energy for the system was determined from\nthe band calculation of the 1D armchair GNRs which\nwas determined to be -4.41 eV. Because of the steric repulsion between hydrogen atoms, the carbon-carbon distances connecting the unit cells in the horizontal direction is longer than that of others. Therefore the armchair\nof GNRs is slightly dimerized giving rise to the band\ngaps [29] around 5 eV, this can be seen as abrupt drop\nin the transmission functions in Fig. 3(a) and (c). The\ntransmission profiles and length dependence of conductance at the Fermi energy with/without dephasing effects\ncalculated using DFTB method are presented in Fig. 3.\nA similar behavior as the one obtained via the simple\ntight binding approximation in Fig. 2 is observed. From\nthe linear trend of coherent tunneling, we determined\nthe damping constants for PPV, 0.241\u00c5\u22121, and pyrrole,\n0.308\u00c5\u22121. The exponential decay associated with coherent transport is quenched as the dephasing effects get\nstronger.\nOnce more, we verified that dephasing dictates the conducting response for longer 1D systems.

Strictly speaking, the MD trajectory should be calculated under non-equilibrium condition and the velocity for the MD should include the\neffect of the heat produced tunneling current, however,\nwe took the at equilibrium condition ignoring the heat\nproduced by tunneling current for simplicity. At least\nfrom this calculation it is possible to examine the change\nof conductance due to the change of molecular structures\nas a crude approximation.\nThe motion of the atoms during the simulations has\nbeen integrated using the standard Velocity Verlet algo-\n\n\f5\n\n(a)\n\n1\n\nPPV-based wire\nPyrole-based wire\n\n0.8\nRMSD\n\nrithm with a time step of 1.0 fs and a total time duration of 10 ps. The influence of structural fluctuations on\nthe conductance is investigated considering that only the\natoms in the scattering region are allowed to move. After\nthe MD simulation, 100 snapshots were extracted from\nthe MD trajectories. Then we calculated the effective\nconductance for the 100 stational geometries in order to\nsee the change of conductance due to the change of the\ncoordinate. The e-ph coupling was set to the same as\nroom temperature, 25.8 meV.

Electronic transmission at the Fermi energy within\ncoherent and incoherent regimes as a function of length on\nthe molecular dynamic flies for PPV-based (upper panel) and\npyrrole-based molecular wires (lower panel). In the incoherent\nregime, dephasing strength was set to 25.8 meV.\n\nFigure 6 shows how the coherent and effective conductances disperse along the MD trajectory with the molecular lengths. The dominance of hopping mechanisms for\nlonger molecules is still preserved along the entire MD\ntrajectory. The dephased transmission clearly deviates\nfrom the exponential trend of coherent tunneling.\nAnother important feature between these two transport regimes is the degree of dispersion observed on the\nlog T v.s. length plots in Fig. 6. Strong fluctuations are\nseen for the length dependence in the coherent tunneling\nregime whereas narrower distributions appear when dephasing effects are considered. This issue can be clarified\nby analyzing the variation of the root-mean standard deviation (RMSD) of molecular coordinates with respect to\na reference coordinate, in this case, the initial one.\nFigure 7 presents the molecular length dependence of\n\nRMSD (left panel) as well as the standard deviation\n(right panel) of the transmission logarithm (log T ) for\nthe coherent and dephased regimes. RMSD results in\nFig. 7(a) point out that longer molecules potentially have\nmore configurational degrees of freedom and, for this reason, RMSD increases with the size of the junction. Both\ntypes of molecules present approximately the same trends\nin the RMSD curves. The standard deviation of log T in\nFig. 7(b) highlights how strongly the coherent/dephased\ntransport fluctuates along MD trajectory. We can see\nthat coherent tunneling is more sensitive to the molecular disorder induced by the thermal fluctuations than\ndephased transport. Thermal fluctuations can disrupt\nthe \u03c0-orbital conjugation of the molecules, localizing the\nstates along the molecular wires. Such breaking of the\ndelocalized \u03c0-orbitals, which bridge the electron tunneling between two contacts, results in a large dispersion of\ncoherent transmission in the log T v.s. length plots in\nFig. 6.\nOn the other hand, in the dephased regime, unlike in\nthe coherent regime, dephased transport does not fluctuate strongly with the breaking of \u03c0-orbital delocalization\nsince there exists many individual jumps with probability\nTm,n for sequential hopping processes and there always\nwill be pathways for hopping that favor transport (note\nthat dephased transport is determined by the sum of coherent tunneling and sequential hoppings). Therefore,\n\n\f6\ndephased transport is less sensitive to thermal fluctuations than coherent tunneling even if the \u03c0-orbital conjugation is thermally disturbed. Another important feature\nin the log T deviation within dephased transport is that\nit decreases for longer molecules. This is simply caused\nby the fact that the number of paths through which the\ncharge can be transmitted increases as the molecule gets\nlonger. The averaging over the increased number of hopping pathways results in a smaller transmission dispersion of dephased transport.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n\u2217\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n\nCONCLUSION\n[7]\n\nIn summary, we have investigated electron transport\nin the presence of dephasing effects by analyzing both\nthe coherent and incoherent process in molecular wires\nconnected between two contacts. By employing the\nD'Amato-Pastawski model with first principle calculations, two transport mechanisms could be examined under room temperature conditions where the structural\nconformations of the systems were explicitly treated. We\nwere able to observe the tunneling-to-hopping transition from exponential (coherent) to Ohmic (incoherent)\nregimes with molecular length using only one control parameter. We also investigated the influence of thermal\nfluctuations and found that the transmission distributions for tunneling transport are broader in comparison\nto those for the hopping mechanism. This highlights that\nthe coherent component is rather more sensitive to structural disorder than the incoherent one. Our simple approach will provide a simulation platform for the interpretation of transport measurements in nanostructures.\n\n[8]\n[9]\n\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n[24]\n\nThis work was funded by the Volkswagen Foundation and by the World Class University program through\nthe Korea Science and Engineering Foundation funded\nby the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology\n(Project No. R31-2008-000-10100-0), Erasmus Mundus,\nMPI-PKS, and Alexander von Humboldt Foundation.\n\n[25]\n[26]\n[27]\n[28]\n[29]\n\nCorresponding\nAuthor,\nElectronic\naddress:cgomes@nano.tu-dresden.de\nJ.
