Introduction. On August 3rd 2005, Jorge E. Hirsch uploaded an article to the arXiv.org ePrint archive (http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0508025), in which he introduced the so-called 2index by means of the following definition (as given in the fifth and last uploaded version):\n\"a scientist has index 2 if 2 of his/her R: papers have at least 2 citations each, and the other\n\u00d0R: \uf081 2\u00d1 papers have no more than 2 citations each\" (see also Hirsch, 2005). On August\n18th, Nature - which until that time had campaigned for a moderate use of the Impact Factor\n- published an article (Ball, 2005), where the 2 -index was presented as \"transparent, unbiased\nand very hard to rig\" and able to \"pick out influential individuals\". The illustrative example\nin the article was a short list of seven high-ranked physicists. The top physicist was Ed\n1\n\n\fWitten of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study \"widely regarded by his peers as the\nmost brilliant living physicist\". On August 19th, a short note appeared on Science\n(Bhattacharjee, 2005), where the value of the 2 -index for Manuel Cardona, a physicist at the\nMax Planck Institute for Solid State Research in Stuttgart, Germany, was given. According to\nBornmann and Daniel (2009), at the initiative of the same Cardona, Hirsch's paper was\npublished a few weeks later in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (Hirsch,\n2005).\nThese circumstances cannot be regarded as a matter of secondary importance in\nexplaining the success met by the 2-index. The immediate endorsement of the index operated\nby two leading scientific journals, and the publication of the paper in a prestigious outlet,\nwere strong signals for an academic community searching for a simple and useful way to\ncharacterize the scientific output of a researcher. In addition, it was immediately realized that\nthe 2-index could be adopted for assessing the research performance of more complex\nstructures, such as: journals, setting up as a competitor of the Impact Factor (Braun et al.,\n2006); groups of scholars, departments and institutions (Molinari and Molinari, 2008, van\nRaan, 2006) and even countries (Mahbuba and Rousseau, 2008, Nejati and Jenab, 2010). At\nthe end of 2008, the Web of Science archive contained about 200 citations to the Hirsch's\npaper (Bornmann and Daniel, 2009) and similar figures also resulted from the Scopus and\nGoogle Scholar archives (Alonso et al., 2009). Two years later, the citations went up to 632\nand at least 755 papers were categorized as 2 -index related literature. This literature\ndocumented the impressive diffusion of 2 -index outside the field of informetrics and\nscientometrics where the mainstream research is obviously developed (Zhang et al., 2011).\nEven more impressive is the popularity of the 2-index in non-scholarly literature. As an\nexample, Wired Magazine wrote that \"The 2 -index was the biggest splash in a flood of\nInternet-enabled rating systems - growth and decay chronometrics, semiometric measures,\nhub/authority metrics. Schools and labs use such ratings to help them make grants, bestow\ntenure, award bonuses, and hire postdocs. In fact, similar statistical approaches have become\nstandard practice in Internet search algorithms and on social networking sites. These numbers\ndo for scientists what [...] Bill James' Sabermetrics did for baseball\" (Gugliotta, 2009).\n2\n\n\fArguably, this global success is due in large part to the simplicity of the mathematical\nstructure of the 2-index and its ease of calculation. A lot of papers (Alonso et al., 2009,\nCostas and Bordons, 2007, Egghe, 2010, Rousseau, 2008) discuss advantages and\ndisadvantages of using the 2 -index. In any case, the 2-index is probably so diffused because\nit is perceived by non-technical readers as a unique numerical value measuring a very\ncomplex phenomenon such as the quality/impact/production of a researcher. Ranking\nscientists according to 2-index is apparently very simple, and differences amongst\nresearchers are directly measurable: \"my 2-index is bigger than your!\".\nScientometricians have worked on the theoretical foundations of 2 -index and three main\nlines of research have been explored. The first line is the deterministic one suggested by\nHirsch (2005), according to which the 2 -index is the result of a linear growth model of\npublication and citation. More interestingly, a second line of research consists of the\nderivation of the 2-index from Lotka's law (Egghe, 2005, 2006, Egghe and Rousseau, 2006,\nYe, 2011). In contrast with these mathematical model approaches, Gl\u00e4nzel (2006) started the\nthird line of research, emphasizing for the first time the relevance of the \"statistical\nbackground\" for the 2 -index. Gl\u00e4nzel required that the citation number of a paper were a\nrandom variable and derived some properties of the 2-index by assuming a Paretian model\nfor the citation number. The importance of this approach is stressed, among others, by\nRousseau (2008) and Panaretos and Malesios (2009).\nWhen the full statistical perspective is considered, i.e. by assuming a statistical model for\nthe citation-count distribution, it should be realized that the original definition provided by\nJorge E. Hirsch gives rise to an empirical index and that the corresponding theoretical index\nhas to be properly defined. Obviously, this process is - in some way - statistically unsound,\nsince the \"estimator\" is defined in advance to the \"parameter\" to be estimated. In any case,\nonce that the definition of the theoretical index is suitably carried out, the statistical\nproperties of the empirical index must be assessed. Even if Gl\u00e4nzel (2006) produced the first\neffort in this direction, the decisive step was made by Beirlant and Einmahl (2010) who\nhandled the empirical 2 -index as the estimator of a suitable statistical functional of the\ncitation-count distribution. Beirlant and Einmahl (2010) also gave the consistency of the\n3\n\n\fempirical 2-index with respect to this functional and the conditions for its large-sample\nnormality. In addition, they provided a variance estimation procedure when the underlying\ncitation-count distribution displays Pareto-type or Weibull-type tails. However, Beirlant and\nEinmahl (2010) stated their theory by assuming a continuous citation-count distribution, even\nif the citation number is obviously an integer. Hence, Pratelli et al. (2012) further developed\nthe results by Beirlant and Einmahl (2010), by achieving similar findings when the citation\ncount follows a distribution supported by the integers. In addition, Pratelli et al. (2012)\nprovided a suitable expression for the variance of empirical 2-index, which allows for simple\nand consistent nonparametric variance estimation. In turn, on the basis of these results, largesample nonparametric confidence intervals may be implemented.\nPanaretos and Malesios (2009) remarked that \"while there exists a vast literature on the\nempirical 2-index and its applications, relatively little work has been done on the study of the\ntheoretical 2-index as a statistical function, allowing to construct confidence intervals, test\nhypotheses and check the validity of its statistical properties\". Hence, the aim of the present\npaper is to divulge the available statistical tools for the inference on the 2 -index, by trying to\nexplain issues and details which may be obscure for non-statisticians. Moreover, an extensive\napplication to real data is given, in order to highlight the importance of producing interval\nestimation, in addition to point estimation. Finally, simultaneous inference techniques are\nintroduced in order to achieve suitable scholar comparisons.\n\n2. The empirical and theoretical 2 -index. Let us assume that \\ be an integer-valued\nrandom variable representing the citation number for a paper of a given scholar. Moreover, it\nis assumed that W be the survival function corresponding to the random variable \\ , i.e.\nW\u00d0B\u00d1 oe T \u00d0\\ \uf09e B\u00d1. Therefore, W\u00d0B\u00d1 constitutes the probability that a paper of the scholar\nreceives more than B citation. The random variable \\ is usually required to be \"heavy-tailed\"\nin the scientometric applications (see e.g. Gl\u00e4nzel, 2006, 2010), even if the results given in\nthis section hold in general. Hence, if the scholar has published 8 papers, the random\nvariables \\\" \u00df \u00e1 \u00df \\8 represent the citation counts for his/her 8 papers. In order to develop\nthe theory, it is required that \\\" \u00df \u00e1 \u00df \\8 be identically and independently distributed.\n4\n\n\fOn the basis of the Hirsch's definition given in the Introduction, the empirical 2-index - say\ns - may be mathematically expressed as\nL\ns \uf081 \"\u00d1\ns oe max\u00d64 \u2212 \uf08d \u00c0 8W\u00d04\nL\n\n4\u00d7 ,\n\n(1)\n\ns represents the empirical survival function, i.e.\nwhere W\n\" 8\ns\nW\u00d0B\u00d1\noe \uf022 M\u00d0Bss\u221e\u00d1 \u00d0\\3 \u00d1 ,\n8 3oe\"\nwhile MI turns out to be the usual indicator function of a set I , i.e. MI \u00d0B\u00d1 oe \" if B \u2212 I and\ns\nMI \u00d0B\u00d1 oe ! otherwise. Obviously, W\u00d0B\u00d1\nis the empirical rate of citation counts greater than a\ns is the \"natural\" estimator of W . Moreover, it is apparent that the quantity\ngiven B and hence W\ns \uf081 \"\u00d1 represents the number of papers receiving at least 4 citations. Thus, it is immediate\n8W\u00d04\nto realize that expression (1) formally states the empirical 2-index in accordance with the\ndefinition provided by Hirsch (2005). However, Pratelli et al. (2012) emphasized that (1)\ns,\ngives rise to the following alternative and equivalent (but more convenient) expression for L\ni.e.\ns \uf081 \"\u00d1\u00d1 .\ns oe \uf022 M\u00d24\u00ce8ss\"\u00d3 \u00d0W\u00d04\nL\n8\n\n(2)\n\n4oe\"\n\ns is a random variable since it depends on the random variables \\\" \u00df \u00e1 \u00df \\8 .\nObviously, L\ns , i.e. the empirical 2-index is actually\ns oe 0 \u00d0W\u00d1\nMoreover, it should be noticed from (2) that L\na functional of the empirical survival function. This remark allows for a suitable definition of\nthe theoretical 2-index - say 2 - which may be inherently defined as 2 oe 0 \u00d0W\u00d1 by adopting\nthe statistical \"correspondence principle\". More precisely, on the basis of expression (2) the\ntheoretical 2-index may be set to\n2 oe \uf022 M\u00d24\u00ce8ss\"\u00d3 \u00d0W\u00d04 \uf081 \"\u00d1\u00d1 ,\n8\n\n(3)\n\n4oe\"\n\nas suggested by Pratelli et al. (2012). Obviously, 2 depends on 8 and it is easily verified that\n2 \u00c4 \u221e and 2\u00ce8 \u00c4 ! as 8 \u00c4 \u221e, a quite unusual behavior for a statistical parameter.\nAs to the main statistical properties of the empirical 2 -index, Pratelli et al. (2012) proved\nthat\n5\n\n\fs oe \uf022 :4\nE\u00d2L\u00d3\n8\n\n4oe\"\n\nand\ns oe \uf022 :4 \u00d0\" \uf081 :4 \u00d1 \uf080 # \uf022\uf022 :6 \u00d0\" \uf081 :4 \u00d1 ,\nVar\u00d2L\u00d3\n8\n\n8 6\uf081\"\n\n4oe\"\n\n6oe# 4oe\"\n\nwhere\n8\n8\n:4 oe \uf022 \uf08a \uf08b W\u00d04 \uf081 \"\u00d16 \u00d0\" \uf081 W\u00d04 \uf081 \"\u00d1\u00d18\uf0816 .\n6\n6oe4\n\ns is a biased estimator for 2. However, since Pratelli et al. (2012)\nThus, it is apparent that L\nshowed that\n\uf0d4 L\n\uf0d7\ns\nlim E \uf08e \uf081 \"\uf08f oe ! ,\n8\n\uf0d5 2\n\uf0d8\n#\n\nT\ns \u00c4\ns\nit also follows that L\u00ce2\n\" as 8 \u00c4 \u221e, i.e. the ratio L\u00ce2\nconverges in probability to one.\n\ns may be considered as a \"consistent\" estimator for 2 , even if in this setting the usual\nThus, L\ndefinition of consistency is pointless since the parameter approaches to infinity as simple size\nincreases (see also a similar comment by Beirlant and Einmahl, 2010).\nAs previously emphasized, in the present framework some arbitrariness arises in the\nchoice of the theoretical 2-index and hence some attention should be put in order to properly\nidentify the reference parameter under estimation. Since in many statistical applications the\nexpected value of the estimator coincides with the parameter to be estimated, we argue that\ns could be considered as a \"natural\" competitor of 2. This suggestion is also supported\nE\u00d2L\u00d3\ns for large 8, i.e.\nby the equivalence of 2 and E\u00d2L\u00d3\nlim\n8\n\ns\nE\u00d2L\u00d3\noe\",\n2\n\nas shown by Pratelli et al. (2012). It is worth noting that 2 solely assumes integer values,\ns is real-valued. In any case, many simulation studies carried out by Pratelli et al.\nwhile E\u00d2L\u00d3\ns are very similar even for small 8.\n(2012) have shown that 2 and E\u00d2L\u00d3\n\n6\n\n\f3. Large-sample properties of the empirical 2 -index. With the aim of achieving the\ns , the assessment of the\nimplementation of large-sample confidence intervals for 2 or E\u00d2L\u00d3\ns is of central importance. It is woth noting that, since\nlarge-sample properties of Var\u00d2L\u00d3\ns \u00c4 \u221e as 8 \u00c4 \u221e and since scientometricians usually required \"heavy-tailed\"\nE\u00d2L\u00d3\ns \u00c4\u221e\ndistributions for the citation counts, the most interesting case should imply that Var\u00d2L\u00d3\nas 8 \u00c4 \u221e.\ns , it is useful to introduce an\nFirst, in order to obtain a conservative estimator of Var\u00d2L\u00d3\noperative condition on the underlying citation distribution, i.e. for each Q \uf09e ! it is assumed\nthat\nT \u00d0\\ oe 4\u00d1\nlim \uf08e sup \uf0ba\n\uf081 \"\uf0ba\uf08f oe ! ,\n8\n4\u2212HQ T \u00d0\\ oe 8\u00d1\n\n(4)\n\nwhere HQ oe \u00d28 \uf081 Q \uf0c88ss 8 \uf080 Q \uf0c88\u00d3 \u2229 \uf08d. Intuitively, if the random variable \\ satisfies\nthe condition (4), for a large 8 its distribution is nearly uniform on an interval of natural\n\nnumbers centered on 8 and with size proportional to \uf0c88. Practically speaking, assumption\n\n(4) actually implies a \"slow decrement\" of T \u00d0\\ oe 8\u00d1 as 8 \u00c4 \u221e. Actually, the underlying\ncitation distribution is commonly assumed to be Pareto-type or Weibull-type (see e.g.\nGl\u00e4nzel, 2006, 2010, Barcza and Telcs, 2009, Beirlant and Einmahl, 2010) and these\ndistribution types - or their mixtures - satisfy condition (4)\u00de As a matter of fact, if 6 is a\nslowly-varying function, i.e. 6\u00d0>B\u00d1\u00ce6\u00d0>\u00d1 \u00c4 \" for each B as > \u00c4 \u221e, a Pareto-type distribution\nis characterized by a survival function given by W\u00d0B\u00d1 oe B\uf081\u03b1 6\u00d0B\u00d1 and hence it verifies (4) for\nany \u03b1 \uf09e !. This distribution type encompasses families of central importance for describing\nheavy-tailed discrete data, such as the discrete stable distribution (see e.g. Marcheselli et al.,\n2008). Analogously, a Weibull-type distribution is characterized by a survival function given\nby W\u00d0B\u00d1 oe exp\u00d0 \uf081 B7 6\u00d0B\u00d1\u00d1 and accordingly it verifies (4) for any 7 \uf09d \"\u00ce#.\nA \"natural\" estimator for the quantity :4 may be obtained in by means of a plug-in of the\nempirical survival function into the expression of :4 , i.e.\n\n7\n\n\f8\n8 s\ns \uf081 \"\u00d1\u00d18\uf0816 .\n\uf022\n\uf081 \"\u00d16 \u00d0\" \uf081 W\u00d04\n\uf08a \uf08b W\u00d04\ns:4 oe\n6\n6oe4\n\ns , by adopting in turn the statistical\nHence, on the basis of the expression of Var\u00d2L\u00d3\n\"correspondence principle\", Pratelli et al.

In expression (5), the\ntruncation of the summation extremes is due to some technical issues in order to improve\nestimation (see Pratelli et al., 2012). Under condition (4) it generally holds that\ns =\u221e,\nlim Var\u00d2L\u00d3\n8\n\ns , in the sense that\nand Pratelli et al. (2012) proved the \"consistency\" of the estimator Z\ns\nZ\n\nT\n\ns\nVar\u00d2L\u00d3\n\n\u00d2\"\n\nas 8 \u00c4 \u221e. In turn, equivalently to the Section 2, the usual definition of consistency is not\ns approaches to infinity as simple size increases. It should be also\nuseful since Var\u00d2L\u00d3\nremarked that estimator (5) is fully nonparametric since it does not require the specification\nof a model for the underlying citation distribution. In contrast, the variance estimator\nproposed by Beirlant and Einmahl (2010) assumes semi-parametric modelling and it implies\nthe estimation of the Paretian index for the Pareto-type family, which is a complicate task. In\naddition, the computation of estimator (5) is straightforward from a practical point of view.\nOn the basis of the findings by Pratelli et al. (2012), if condition (4) is verified, the larges holds, i.e. the following convergences in distribution are achieved\nsample normality of L\ns \uf0812\ns \uf081 E\u00d2L\u00d3\ns .\nL\nL\n\u03bc\n\u00d2 R \u00d0!\u00df \"\u00d1 ,\n\uf0c8Z\n\uf0c8Z\ns\ns\nas 8 \u00c4 \u221e, where - as usual - R \u00d0!\u00df \"\u00d1 represents a standard Normal random variable. The\nprevious result provides the pivotal quantities for the implementation of a large-sample\nconfidence set at the \u00d0\" \uf081 # \u00d1 confidence level for 2 given by\n\n8\n\n\fs \uf081 D\"\uf081#\u00ce# \uf0c8Z\ns \u00d5ss \u00e1 \u00df \u00d4L\ns \uf080 D\"\uf081#\u00ce# \uf0c8Z\ns \u00d5\u00d7 ,\nG oe \u00d6\u00d4L\nwhere D# represents the # -th quantile of the standard Normal distribution, while \u00d4B\u00d5\nrepresents the integer closest to B. Obviously, G turns out to be a confidence set since 2 may\nsolely assume integer values. Similarly, a large-sample confidence interval at the \u00d0\" \uf081 # \u00d1\ns is given by\nconfidence level for E\u00d2L\u00d3\n\ns \uf081 D\"\uf081#\u00ce# \uf0c8Z\ns \u00dfL\ns \uf080 D\"\uf081#\u00ce# \uf0c8Z\ns\u00d1.\nG w oe \u00d0L\n\nIt should be again emphasized that G and G w are fully nonparametric confidence set and\ninterval, respectively. Indeed, their implementation does not demand the specification of a\ndistribution and solely requires the validity of condition (4), which is likely to hold for almost\nall the distributions of interest in the area of scientometrics. Moreover, a large simulation\nstudy carried out by Pratelli et al. (2012) show that the actual coverage of G and G w is\nappropriate even for quite small 8.\nIn the case that 5 scholars have to be jointly compared, a suitable procedure should be\napplied in order to achieve simultaneous inference\u00de Let us suppose that the 5 scholars act\nindependently and that they have published 8\" \u00df \u00e1 \u00df 85 papers each, while their corresponding\ns \"\u00df \u00e1 \u00df L\ns 5 be the empirical\n5 theoretical 2-index are given by 2\" \u00df \u00e1 \u00df 25 . Accordingly, let L\ns \"\u00df \u00e1 \u00df Z\ns 5 be the variance estimators. Thus, on the basis\n2 -indexes of these scholars and let Z\nof the procedure suggested by \u0160id\u00e1k (1967), 5 \u2021 oe 5\u00d05 \uf081 \"\u00d1\u00ce# large-sample conservative\nsimultaneous confidence sets for the differences \u00d024 \uf081 26 \u00d1 (6 \uf09e 4 oe \"\u00df \u00e1 \u00df 5 ) at the \u00d0\" \uf081 # \u00d1\nconfidence level are given by\ns4 \uf081 L\ns 6 \uf081 D# \u2021 \uf0c9 Z\ns 46 \u00d5ss \u00e1 \u00df \u00d4L\ns4 \uf081 L\ns 6 \uf080 D# \u2021 \uf0c9 Z\ns 46 \u00d5\u00d7 ,\nG46 oe \u00d6\u00d4L\ns 46 oe Z\ns4\uf080Z\ns 6 , while # \u2021 oe \u00d0\" \uf080 \u00d0\" \uf081 # \u00d1\"\u00ce5\u2021 \u00d1\u00ce# .

Some real data examples. In order to exemplify the discussed statistical tools, we have\nconsidered the citation datasets of the Nobel Laureates in the last five years and of the Fields\nmedallists from 2002 onward. Citation performances of these authors are drawn from an\nauthor search on Scopus carried out during February 2012. Tables I and II present the\nanalyzed scholars, who are ordered according to their empirical 2 -indexes for each discipline.\nMoreover, in these Tables the number of papers, the empirical 2-index and the large-sample\nconfidence set at the *&% confidence level are given for each scholar.\nAs a specific example for the statistical interpretation of Tables I and II, Adrian Fert winner of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2007 - displays an empirical 2 -index equal to &#,\ns oe &#\nwhich is the highest for physicists. Once that the inferential paradigm is assumed, L\nconstitutes a point estimate of the (unknown) theoretical 2-index and it should be coupled\nwith an estimate of the sampling variability. Loosely speaking, the set estimate - i.e. the\ncorresponding confidence set \u00d6%'\u00df \u00e1 \u00df &)\u00d7 - allows for jointly assessing the two aspects. The\npoint estimate and the confidence set of Adrian Fert are not really different from those of\nAndre Geim, the second in this ranking. In contrast, Konstantin Novoselov displays an\nempirical 2-index equal to %#, even if the corresponding confidence set, i.e. \u00d6$&\u00df \u00e1 \u00df %*\u00d7,\noverlaps the confidence sets of the previous physicists.\n\nTables I and II about here\n\nA simple analysis of the Tables I and II leads to three main conclusions. The first\nargument is well-known, in the sense that top scientists in different disciplines have different\nscientometric indexes. These differences mainly depend on the specific pattern of\nproductivity and on the citation habits of the discipline. The second conclusion relies on the\nfact that in each discipline the use of the 2 -index flattens the performance of scholars. The\nchoice of a unique value - synthesizing the individual productivity and the citations received\n10\n\n\f- tends to equalize very different publication behaviors adopted by different scholars. As an\nexample, in Physics Adrian Fert and Brian Schmidt have similar empirical 2-indexes, even if\nAdrian Fert published a number of papers which is double with respect to Brian Schmidt. The\nthird conclusion is the most striking one: in each discipline the majority of confidence sets\nintersects, so that a strict ranking of the considered scholars may not be feasible. This is a\nvery important issue, since the common use of the 2-index aims to rank individuals, journals\nand so on. If these rankings fail to consider the sample variability, the differences between\nscholars in different positions may be not more than an optical illusion.\nIn order to show the practical implementation of simultaneous inference, the Nobel\nLaureates for Economics have been analyzed. Since in this group there are 5 oe \"! scholars\nwith\n\ntheoretical\n\n2-indexes\n\ngiven\n\nby\n\n2\" \u00df \u00e1 \u00df 2\"! ,\n\n5 \u2021 oe %&\n\ndifferences\n\n\u00d024 \uf081 26 \u00d1\n\n(6 \uf09e 4 oe \"\u00df \u00e1 \u00df \"!) must be considered. Table III reports the corresponding large-sample\npairwise simultaneous confidence sets at the *&% confidence level. By analyzing Table III, if\nthe simultaneous confidence sets not containing the zero are considered, some orderings on\nthe theoretical 2-indexes may be statistically stated. More precisely, by considering the first\nnine confidence intervals, it follows that 2\" \uf09e 2) \u00df 2* \u00df 2\"! ; the subsequent eight confidence\nintervals provide 2# \uf09e 2) \u00df 2* \u00df 2\"! ; the subsequent seven confidence intervals provide\n2$ \uf09e 2* \u00df 2\"! ; the subsequent six confidence intervals provide 2% \uf09e 2\"! ; the subsequent five\nconfidence intervals provide 2& \uf09e 2\"! ; the subsequent four confidence intervals provide\n2' \uf09e 2\"! ; the subsequent three confidence intervals provide 2( \uf09e 2\"! . Hence, a strict\nstatistical ranking of these scholars is not available. Indeed, in synthesis, it can be solely\nstated that 2\" \u00df 2# \uf09e 2) \u00df 2* \u00df 2\"! , 2$ \uf09e 2* \u00df 2\"! and 2% \u00df 2& \u00df 2' \u00df 2( \uf09e 2\"! at the *&% confidence\nlevel.\n\nTable III about here\n\nThe previous analyses emphasize that the application of the correct statistical approach\nshould be demanded in bibliometrics and scientometrics, where the adopted methods often\nappear pre-statistical and pre-inferential. As noticed by Peter Hall \"... issues that are obvious\n11\n\n\fto statisticians are often ignored in bibliometric analysis ...\", and for example \"... many\nproponents of impact factors, and other aspects of citation analysis, have little concept of the\nproblems caused by averaging very heavy tailed data ...\" (IMS Presidential Address, IMS\nBulletin Online, September 2, 2011). On the other hand, Peter Hall concludes that \"... we\nshould definitely take a greater interest in this area\". Indeed, also in our opinion,\nscientometricians and statisticians should be more and more cooperative in order to achieve a\nproper development for the evaluation of the scientific performance.\n\nBibliography\n\nAlonso, S., Cabrerizo, F.J., Herrera-Viedma, E. and Herrera, F.
