The equations that\ntogether govern the autoresonance solutions and excitations are derived with\nthe aid of a variational principle concerning the power functional. These equations provide a feedback autoresonance-controlling mechanism. The theory is\napplied to Duffing-like systems to obtain exact analytical expressions for autoresonance excitations and solutions which explain all the phenomenological\nand approximate results arising from a previous (adiabatic) approach to autoresonance phenomena in such systems. The theory is also applied to obtain\nnew, general, and exact properties concerning autoresonance phenomena in a\nbroad class of dissipative and Hamiltonian systems, including (as a particular\ncase) Duffing-like systems.\nPACS number: 05.45.-a Nonlinear dynamics and nonlinear dynamical\nsystems\n\nIt has been well known for about half a century that autoresonance (AR) phenomena\noccur when a system continuously adjusts its amplitude so that its instantaneous nonlinear period matches the driving period, the effect being a growth of the system's energy.\nAutoresonant effects were first observed in particle accelerators [1,2], and have since been\nnoted in nonlinear waves [3,4], fluid dynamics [5,6], atomic and molecular physics [7,8],\nplasmas [9-11], nonlinear oscillators [12,13], and planetary dynamics [14-17]. Apparently,\nthe first mention of the notion of resonance (\"risonanza\") was by Galileo [18]. Remarkably,\nthis linear-system-based concept has survived up to now: resonance (nonlinear resonance) is\nidentified with how well the driving period fits (a rational fraction of) a natural period of the\nunderlying conservative system [19]. However, the genuine effect of the frequency (Galilean)\nresonance (FR) (i.e., the secular growth of the oscillation amplitude) can no longer be observed in a periodically driven nonlinear system. As is well known, the reason is simple: a\n2\n\n\flinear oscillator has a single period which is energy-independent, while nonlinear oscillators\ngenerally present an infinity of energy-dependent periods. This means that, although an FR\ncan still be momentarily induced in a nonlinear system by exciting it with a driving period\nthat exactly matches the intrinsic period of the current motion, the subsequent growth of the\nnonlinear oscillations changes the intrinsic period of the motion, which no longer matches\nthe excitation period and thus takes the system out of FR. Since linear oscillations represent\na limiting degenerate (energy) case of the more general nonlinear oscillations, it seems that\nany truly nonlinear generalization of the notion of resonance, in its early (etymological)\nsense of resonare (i.e., awaken an echo of some underlying nonlinear oscillation), should\nbe based on energy (or action) considerations. A case has been provided by the notion of\ngeometrical resonance [20]. Thus, if one is interested in obtaining a nonlinear equivalent\nof the secular maintained growth intrinsic to the FR, it is clear that the system must not\nbe driven by a strictly periodic excitation. In this regard, a previous theoretical approach\nto autoresonance phenomena [3,7-11] provided an early explanation of the mechanism inducing the growth of the oscillation (without the use of feedback) for particular classes of\nresonantly driven nonlinear systems which stay locked with an adiabatically varying perturbing oscillation (the drive). The adiabatic excitation yields the autoresonant effect by\nautomatically adjusting the system's amplitude so that the instantaneous nonlinear period\nmatches the driving period. It should be stressed that a fundamental part (hereafter referred\nto as adiabatic autoresonance (AAR) theory, cf. refs. [9-11,21,22]) of the aforementioned\nprevious theoretical approach to AR phenomena presents severe limitations of applicability\nand insight: essentially (see ref. [22] for a review), it was developed for nonlinear oscillators\nthat reduce to a Duffing oscillator\n..\n\n.\n\nx +\u03c902 (x + bx3 ) = \u2212\u03b4 x +\u03b5 cos \u03c90 t + \u03b1t2 /2\n\n\u0001\n\n(1)\n\nfor small amplitudes, where \u03b1 is the linear sweep rate and \u03b4 > 0. In the context of AAR\ntheory, it has been found numerically that AR solutions only occur if (i) the damping\ncoefficient \u03b4 is not too large, and (ii) the amplitude of the AR oscillations grows on the\n3\n\n\faverage, but also oscillates around the average growth. Also, AAR theory predicts that\n(iii) there exists a threshold for AR, in particular, if the normalized excitation amplitude\n1/2\n\n\u03b5/\u03c90\n\nexceeds a threshold proportional to \u03b13/4 , the system will follow the excitation to\n\nhigh amplitude, while the amplitude will stay very low otherwise, (iv) that the threshold\nsweep rate \u03b1th scales as \u03b4 2 , (v) that the AR effect is solely expected for the case with initial\nconditions near some equilibrium of the (unperturbed) nonlinear system, and (vi) that there\nexists a breaking time for AR, tb . Properties (ii), (iii), (v), (vi) also hold in (vii) the case\nwith no dissipation (cf. refs. [9, 10, 21]), but there has as yet been no theoretical explanation\nof that fact. It is worth mentioning that, to the best of the author's knowledge, the case of\nweak dissipation has only been considered in a single previous work (cf. ref. [11]).\nIn this Letter a new, general, and energy-based theory for AR phenomena in nonautonomous systems is presented and applied to the above Duffing oscillators to explain conjointly points (i)-(vii) as well as to deduce new properties concerning AR phenomena in\ngeneric systems (including Duffing-like systems). The theory arises from the question as to\nwhether there exists an upper limit for the growth rate of the system's amplitude when a\nsmall-amplitude force acts on the system. Consider the general family of systems\n..\n\n.\n\n.\n\nx = g(x) \u2212 d(x, x) + p(x, x)F (t),\n\n(2)\n.\n\nwhere g(x) \u2261 \u2212dV (x)/dx [V (x) being an arbitrary time-independent potential], \u2212d(x, x) is\n.\n\na general damping force, and p(x, x)F (t) is an as yet undetermined suitable AR-inducing\n\u0003\n.\n. \u0002\n.\n.\nforce. Clearly, the corresponding equation for the energy is E = x \u2212d(x, x) + p(x, x)F (t) \u2261\n.\n\n.2\n\n.\n\nP (x, x, t), where E(t) \u2261 (1/2) x (t)+V [x(t)] and P (x, x, t) are the energy and power, respec-\n\ntively. In the spirit of the aforementioned energy-based approach to resonance phenomena,\nRt\n.\nthe AR solutions are defined by imposing that the energy variation \u2206E = t12 P (x, x, t)dt\nis a maximum (with t1 , t2 arbitrary but fixed instants), where the power is considered as a\n\nfunctional. This implies a necessary condition (hereafter referred to as the AR condition)\nto be fulfilled by AR solutions and excitations, which is the Euler equation [23]\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd \u2202P\n\u2202P\n\u2212\n= 0.\n.\n\u2202x\ndt \u2202 x\n4\n\n(3)\n\n\f.\n\nFrom eq. (3), a relationship between x, x, and F can be deduced such that the solutions of\nthe system given by eqs. (2) and (3) together provide the AR excitations, FAR (t), and the\nAR solutions, xAR (t). It is worth noting that the AR condition (3) represents a feedback\nAR-controlling mechanism, which is absent in the aforementioned previous approach to AR\nphenomena [3,7-11] where an explicit, coordinate-independent, and adiabatic force is used\nfrom the beginning. In this regard, autoresonant control has been previously discussed in\nthe context of vibro-impact systems [24] on the basis of the analysis of nearly sinusoidal selfoscillations [25] where the term self-resonance was introduced to indicate \"resonance under\nthe action of a force generated by the motion of the system itself\" (cf. ref. [25], p.166).\nThe corresponding AR equations for the multidimensional case can be straightforwardly\nobtained from the same principle and they will be discussed elsewhere [26]. To compare\nthe present approach with the previous one [9,11,21,22] (cf. eq. (1)), consider the power\n\u0003\n.\n. \u0002\n.\nfunctional P (x, x, t) =x \u2212\u03b4 x +F (t) . For the particular case of Duffing oscillators, the\nsystem (2), (3) reduces to\n\n\u0001\n..\n.\nxAR +\u03c902 xAR + bx3AR = \u03b4 xAR ,\n.\n\nFAR = 2\u03b4 xAR .\n\n(4a)\n(4b)\n\nNote that eq. (4b) gives the AR condition, i.e., the AR excitations and the (corresponding)\nAR solutions have the same instantaneous nonlinear period, at all instants, but without the\nadiabaticity requirement of the AAR theory. Generally, the AR condition (3) means that\nthe instantaneous period of the AR solution fits a rational fraction of the instantaneous\nperiod of the AR excitation. This property generalizes (and contains as a particular case)\nthe persistent phase-locking condition of the AAR theory. To obtain AR solutions (and\nhence AR excitations, cf. eq. (4b)) consider the ansatz xAR (t) = \u03b3f (t) cn [\u03b2g(t) + \u03c6; m],\nwhere cn is the Jacobian elliptic function of parameter m, and where the constants \u03b2, m,\nand the functions f (t), g(t) have to be determined for the ansatz to satisfy eq. (4a), while\n\u03b3, \u03c6 are arbitrary constants. After substituting this ansatz into eq. (4a), one finds the exact\ngeneral AR solution\n5\n\n\fxAR (t) = \u03b30 e\u03b4t/3 cn [\u03c6 (t) ; 1/2] ,\n\u221a\n\u0001\n\u03c6 (t) \u2261 3\u03b30 \u03c90 b e\u03b4t/3 \u2212 1 /\u03b4 + \u03c60 ,\n\n(5)\n\n\u221a\nwith the constraint \u03c902 = 2\u03b4 2 /9 and where \u03c60 \u2261 \u03c6 + 3\u03b30 \u03c90 b/\u03b4, \u03b30 \u2261 \u03b3. Clearly, the exact\nAR excitation corresponding to solution (5) is\n\u221a\n2\nFAR (t) = \u03b30 \u03b4 2 e\u03b4t/3 cn [\u03c6(t); 1/2] \u2212 2\u03b302 \u03b4\u03c90 be2\u03b4t/3 sn [\u03c6 (t) ; 1/2] dn [\u03c6 (t) ; 1/2] ,\n3\n\n(6)\n\nwhere sn and dn are the Jacobian elliptic functions. Observe that the particular timedependence of the AR solution (5) directly explains the above point (ii) (see fig.\n\n1).\n\nIn comparing the present predictions with those from AAR theory, recall that the lat.\n\nter solely exist for the case with x(0) \u2243 0, x (0) \u2243 0, for b > 0 (point (v)).\nThus, for this case \u03b30 \u2243 0 and hence eq. (6) can be approximated by FAR (t) \u2243\ni\n\u0001 h \u221a\n\u0001\n2\n1\n1\n2\n2\n\u03b3\n\u03b4\n1\n+\n\u03b4t\n+\n...\ncn\n\u03b3\n\u03c9\n\u03b4t\n+\n...\n;\n1/2\n, and, using the Fourier expansion of\nb\n\u03c9\nt\n+\n0\n0\n3 0\n3\n6 0\ncn [27], one finally obtains\n\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0014\n\u0013\u0015\n\u221a\n1\n1\n2\n2\n\u2032\n2\nFAR (t) \u2243 \u03ba\u03b30 \u03b4 1 + \u03b4t + ... cos \u03ba \u03b30 b \u03c90 t + \u03c90 \u03b4t + ... ,\n(7)\n3\n3\n6\n\u221a\nwhere \u03ba \u2261 \u03c0 2 csch(\u03c0/2)/K(1/2) \u2243 1, \u03ba\u2032 \u2261 \u03c0/(2K(1/2)) \u2243 1. Now, one sees that to\nconsider the excitation \u03b5 cos (\u03c90 t + \u03b1t2 /2) (cf. eq. (1)) as a reliable approximation to FAR (t)\n(cf. eq. (7)) implies that the damping coefficient has to be sufficiently small (point (i)) so\nas to have a sufficiently large breaking time, tb \u223c \u03b4 \u22121 (point (vi)). Thus, for t . tb , one\nobtains \u03b5th \u223c \u03b4 2 , \u03b1th \u223c \u03c90 \u03b4 (cf. eqs. (1), (7)). When \u03c90 \u223c \u03b4 (recall that \u03c902 = 2\u03b4 2 /9 for\nthe exact AR solution (5)), one finds \u03b1th \u223c \u03b4 2 (point (iv)), which explains the adiabaticity\n1/2\n\nrequirement of AAR theory for dissipative systems, \u03b5th /\u03c90\n\n1/4\n\n3/4\n\n\u223c \u03b1th /\u03b1th \u2261 \u03b1th (point (iii)),\n\nand the cosine's argument in eq. (7) can be reliably approximated by the first two terms,\nas in AAR theory (cf. eq. (1)). Figure 1 shows an illustrative comparison between the AR\nresponses yielded by AR excitations given by \u03b5 cos(\u03c90 t + \u03b1t2 /2), where in all cases \u03b5 > \u03b5th ,\nand FAR (t) (cf. eq. (6)), respectively, for the cases \u03c90 \u223c \u03b4 (fig. 1a) and \u03c90 \u226b \u03b4 (fig. 1b).\nPoint (vii) is rather striking in view of the very different properties of Hamiltonian and\ndissipative systems, and its explanation is a little more subtle. Firstly, note that current AR\n6\n\n\ftheory provides an unsatisfactory result for the limiting Hamiltonian case. For example, eq.\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n(3) yields r(x) F (t) = 0 for the family given by eq. (2) with d(x, x) \u2261 0, p(x, x) \u2261 r(x), i.e.,\nincluding the cases of external and parametric (of a potential term) excitations. Clearly,\nthe two possible types of corresponding particular solutions, equilibria and those yielded\nby a constant excitation (cf. eqs. (2), (3)), can no longer be AR solutions. Secondly,\n..\n\nfor the above Duffing oscillators one has xAR +\u03c902 (xAR + bx3AR ) = FAR /2 (cf. eq. (4)).\n.\n\nTherefore, it is natural to assume the ansatz F (t) \u2261 \u03bb x (t), \u03bb > 0, for the case with\nno dissipation, where now the AR rate, \u03bb, is a free parameter which controls the initial\nexcitation strength. Thus, the corresponding AR solutions are given by eq. (5) while AR\nexcitations are given by the expression in eq. (6) multiplied by 1/2, both with \u03bb instead\nof \u03b4, which explains point (vii) and hence the adiabaticity requirement of AAR theory for\nHamiltonian systems (recall point (iv)). It is worth mentioning that this valuable result\n..\n\n.\n\n. n\u22121\n\nholds for the broad family of dissipative systems x +dV (x)/dx = \u2212\u03b4 x x\n.\n\n. n\u22121\n\nwhere V (x) is a generic time-independent potential and \u2212\u03b4 x x\n\n+ F (t),\n\nis a general dissipative\n\nforce (\u03b4 > 0, n = 1, 2, 3, ...). The corresponding AR equations (cf. eqs. (2), (3)) are\n..\n\n.\n\n.\n\nxAR +dV (xAR )/dxAR = n\u03b4 xAR xAR\n\nn\u22121\n\n.\n\n.\n\n, FAR = (n + 1)\u03b4 xAR xAR\n\nn\u22121\n\n, and hence one\n\n..\n\nobtains xAR +dV (xAR )/dxAR = nFAR /(n + 1). For the limiting Hamiltonian case (\u03b4 = 0), it\n.\n\n. n\u22121\n\nis therefore natural to assume the ansatz F (t) \u2261 n\u03bb x x\n\n, \u03bb > 0. Thus, AR solutions are\n\nthe same for the dissipative and Hamiltonian cases, while the AR excitations associated with\nthe Hamiltonian case are the (corresponding) AR excitations associated with the dissipative\ncase multiplied by\n\nn\n,\nn+1\n\nwith \u03bb instead of \u03b4 for the Hamiltonian case [28]. In the light\n\nof the exact AR excitation (cf. eq. (6)), one can readily obtain a reliable approximation\nfor arbitrary initial conditions, i.e., not just those near the equilibrium of the unperturbed\nDuffing oscillator:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0014\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0012\n\u221a\n1\n1\n2\n2\n\u2032\n2\nFAR (t) \u2243 \u03ba\u03b30 \u03b4 1 + \u03b4t + ... cos \u03ba \u03b30 b \u03c90 t + \u03c90 \u03b4t + ...\n3\n3\n6\n\u0013\n\u0014\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2\n1\n\u2032\n2\n\u2032\u2032 2\n(8)\n\u2212\u03ba \u03b30 \u03b4\u03c90 b 1 + \u03b4t + ... sin \u03ba \u03b30 b \u03c90 t + \u03c90 \u03b4t + ... ,\n3\n6\n\u221a\n\u221a \u0001\nwhere \u03ba\u2032\u2032 \u2261 \u03c0 2 2 sech (\u03c0/2) /K 2 (1/2) \u2243 1.61819 \u2243 1 + 5 /2 (i.e., the golden ratio).\n7\n\n\fThus, for t . tb \u223c \u03b4 \u22121 (\u03bb\u22121 ) one obtains the general (i.e., valid for any initial condition)\n1st-order adiabatic excitation\n\u0001\n\u0001\nFA,1 (t) = \u03b5 cos \u03c90 t + \u03b1t2 /2 \u2212 \u03b5\u2032 sin \u03c90 t + \u03b1t2 /2 ,\n\n(9)\n\nwith the above scalings for \u03b5th , \u03b1th , and \u03b5\u2032th \u223c \u03b5th \u03b30 b1/2 . Figure 2 shows illustrative examples\n.\n\nfor several initial conditions far from x (0) =x (0) = 0. Another fundamental consequence of\nthe present approach is the derivation of the scaling laws for the thresholds corresponding to\nhigher-order chirps [29]. Indeed, consider the general nth-order adiabatic excitation FA,n (t) \u2261\nP\nn\n2\n\u03b5 cos [\u03c9 (t) t] \u2212 \u03b5\u2032 sin [\u03c9 (t) t], \u03c9 (t) \u2261 \u03c90 + \u221e\nn=1 \u03b1n t , instead of \u03b5 cos (\u03c90 t + \u03b1t /2) in eq.\n(1), where \u03b1n is the nth-order sweep rate (\u03b11 \u2261 \u03b1/2). For this general case, the above\n1/2\n\nanalysis straightforwardly yields the scaling law \u03b5th /\u03c90\n\n3/(2n+2)\n\n\u223c N(n)\u03b1n,th\n\nfor t . tb \u223c\n\n\u03b4 \u22121 (\u03bb\u22121 ), where \u03b1n,th is the threshold nth-order sweep rate and N(n) \u2261 [3n (n + 1)!]3/(2n+2)\nis a monotonous increasing function. Thus, the 3/4 scaling law is a particular law which\nsolely applies to a linear chirp. For the case of a single chirp term (\u03c9 (t) \u2261 \u03c90 + \u03b1n tn ), the\ndependence of the above general scaling law on n indicates that one can expect a similar\nAR effect for ever smaller values of \u03b1n as n increases. Computer simulations confirm this\npoint: an illustrative example is shown in fig. 3.\nA further question remains to be discussed: We have seen why AAR theory requires\nAR excitations to be adiabatically varying perturbing oscillations, but which are the underlying adiabatic invariants? To answer this question, note that eq. (4a) (with \u03bb instead\nof \u03b4 for the case with no dissipation) can be derived from a Lagrangian, which one de.\n\nfines as L = e\u2212\u03b4t (p2 /2 \u2212 \u03c902 x2 /2 \u2212 \u03c902 bx4 /4) , p \u2261x, and whose associated Hamiltonian is\nH = p2 e\u03b4t /2 + \u03c902(x2 /2 + bx4 /4)e\u2212\u03b4t . The form of this Hamiltonian suggests the following\nsimplifying canonical transformation: X = xe\u2212\u03b4t/2 , P = pe\u03b4t/2 . It is straightforward to see\nthat the generating function of the canonical transformation [30] is F2 (x, P, t) = xP e\u2212\u03b4t/2 .\nThe new Hamiltonian therefore reads: K(X, P, t) = H(x, p, t)\u2212\u2202F2 /\u2202t = P 2/2+\u03c902 (X 2 /2+\nbe\u03b4t X 4 /4) + \u03b4P X/2. In the limiting linear case (b = 0), one sees that K is conserved, i.e., the\nAR solutions corresponding to the linear system are associated (in terms of the old canoni8\n\n\fcal variables) with the invariant e\u03b4t p2 /2 + \u03c902e\u2212\u03b4t x2 /2 + \u03b4xp/2, while for the nonlinear case\n(b 6= 0) one obtains (after expanding e\u03b4t ) that the respective AR solutions are associated\nwith the adiabatic invariant p2 /2 + \u03c902 (x2 /2 + bx4 /4) + \u03b4xp/2 \u2261 E + \u03b4xp/2 over the time\ninterval 0 6 t 6 tAI , tAI \u223c \u03b4 \u22121 (i.e., the same scaling as for the breaking time, tb , deduced\nabove), where E is the energy of the underlying integrable Duffing oscillator. Observe that\nthe adiabatic invariant reduces to E provided that \u03b4 (\u03bb) is sufficiently small (as required in\nAAR theory) and that the same result is obtained for a general potential V (x) instead of\nDuffing's potential.\nIn sum, a general energy-based theory of AR phenomena in low-dimensional nonautonomous systems has been deduced from a simple variational principle concerning the\npower functional. In particular, the theory explains all the phenomenological and approximate results arising from a previous adiabatic approach to AR in Duffing-like systems. For\nthis class of systems, the present theory also explains the adiabaticity requirement as well\nas why the same theoretical predictions hold in the cases with and without dissipation, and\nyields the analytical expression for the adiabatic invariants. Additionally, new adiabatic\napproximations to AR excitations are derived concerning two general cases which were not\nconsidered in the previous adiabatic approach, namely, the case of arbitrary initial conditions (not just those near equilibria) and the case of arbitrary potential (not just linear)\nchirps, for which new general scaling laws were deduced (including the 3/4 scaling law as\na particular case). Computer simulations confirmed all the theoretical predictions. In view\nof the generality of the present theory of AR, one can expect it to be quite readily testable\nby experiment (e.g., in the Diocotron system in pure-electron plasmas), and that it will find\napplications in different fields of physics, such as plasmas, fluids, and solar system dynamics.\nThe author thanks Professor Friedland for kindly providing a reprint of ref.
