The subject has been\nstudied widely in the literature, from a number of\ndifferent points of view (for a recent overview of\ndifferent approaches, see [1]). Regarding the impedance\nspectrum, our focus is on different interpolations of the\nhorn's profile. More specifically we are interested in\ninterpolations that lead to analytic solutions of the\nWebster equation, without any mismatch of the wave\nfronts at segment boundaries. We consider different\ncriteria for establishing an optimal interpolation and\ncompare our results with standard piecewise conical\napproximations. In particular, we examine the effects of\nthe interpolation on impedance and on resonance\nfrequencies, presenting also the temperature dependence\nof our results. We use a Dolnet clarinet as our prototype\nexample.\nTo test our results on impedance, we apply them to the\ncalculation of radiated pressure as a function of time.\nThis relies on solving numerically the Schumacher\nequation [2], which is a convolution-type equation in\nreal time. Input ingredients for this equation are the\nreflection function in the time domain, which can be\nderived from the numerical results on the impedance\nspectrum, as well as a mathematical description for the\nmouthpiece. Such a description is provided by a widely\nused model [3], applicable to single reed instruments.\n\nwith the corresponding impedance ratios. Section 3\ndiscusses an optimal interpolation and presents results\nof the numerical calculations, showing the effect of\ntemperature and of different interpolations on the\nimpedance spectrum. Section 4 applies the impedance\nresults to the calculation of radiated pressure. It presents\nnumerical results for the reflection function in the time\ndomain, comparing different interpolations, and results\non pressure, as a function of time.\n(A longer write-up, including a more complete list of\nreferences, can be found at: http://xxx.lanl.gov/)\n\n2\nThe Webster equation-Analytic\nsolutions, impedance ratios\nWe start with some standard definitions and notation\n[1,4]; the results presented in this Section, are for the\nmost part, well known in the literature.

Other\nalternatives to Zfl are possible, but a correct expression\nfor a horn with a thin flange is not available.\nThus, to calculate the input impedance ZIN of a horn we\niterate over segments, starting from the flare (right end),\nonce a suitable interpolation for each segment has been\nestablished. Impedance matching on the right edge of a\nsegment gives the ratio \u03b32/\u03b31 via Eq.(17), while the\nimpedance at the left edge is obtained through Eq.(16).\nDeciding on the optimal interpolation for each segment\nrequires a detailed investigation, which we address next.\n\n\fForum Acusticum 2005 Conference\n\n3\nOptimized interpolations\nResults on impedance\n\nSkouroupathis, Panagopoulos\n\na 0 m (\u2212 sin mx R + T cos mx R ) = f R\u2032\n\nThe profile of a horn is typically described though a set\nof values of the horn radius corresponding to selected\nlocations along the horn's symmetry axis. At all other\nlocations, the profile must be smoothly interpolated.\nThe general problem of interpolation is certainly a\nwidely studied area in Applied Mathematics, where\nstandard sets of functions (polynomial splines, Pad\u00e9\napproximants, etc.) are typically used; the difference in\nthis context is the requirement to use only those\nfunctional forms which lead to analytic solution of the\nWebster equation, as described in Section 2.\nThe simplest approximation is the conical one, in which\nthe profile is made up of adjacent straight line intervals,\njoined together at their endpoints; the horn is thus a\nconcatenation of straight conical sections. Despite the\nmismatch in wave fronts, this approximation is the most\nstandard one and will be used as a point of comparison\nin testing other interpolations.\nThe remaining available functional forms (Bessel,\ntranscendental) contain an extra (third) free parameter;\ntwo parameters are then used up in order to match the\nprescribed values of the radius at the two endpoints of a\nsegment and the third parameter can be tuned so as to\naffect the slope of the profile. There are many ways of\nadjusting the slope and one must use some criterion in\norder to select the optimal one. One family of\nalgorithms which we tested involves visiting each\nsegment in sequence, and matching its slope to that of\nthe previous segment, at their common endpoint. Thus,\nif fL and fR are the prescribed values of the profile at the\ntwo endpoints xL, xR, of a segment, and f R\u2032 is a\nprescribed value of the slope at the right end, we have\nthree equations to solve for the three parameters.\n\n3.1\nApplicability of the Bessel and transcendental interpolations\nLet us examine these equations for the Bessel interpolation, in order to test the limits of its applicability:\nb (x L \u2212 x 0 )\u2212\u03b5 = f L , b (x R \u2212 x 0 )\u2212\u03b5 = f R , \u2212 \u03b5 b (xR \u2212 x0 )\u2212\u03b5 \u22121 = f R\u2032\n\n(19)\nWe must check for which values of fL, fR, f R\u2032 , these\nequations admit a (unique) solution for the parameters\nb, \u03b5, x0 . We find this to be the case provided:\nln ( f R f L )\n>1\n( xR \u2212 xL ) ( f R\u2032 f R )\n\na0 ( cos mxL , R + T sin mxL , R ) = f L , R\n\n-\n\n(20)\n\nIf this criterion is not fulfilled for each segment, the\nBessel interpolation is not applicable.\nA similar procedure can be applied to sinusoidal\ninterpolations. The equations to be solved now read:\n\n(21)\n(22)\n\nAgain, we must check under which conditions there will\nbe a solution for a0, m, T. The above can be combined to\ngive an equation for m ( \u2206x = xR \u2212 xL ) :\nf R\u2032\n\nsin m\u2206x f R cos m\u2206x \u2212 f L\n=\nm\u2206x\n\u2206x\n\n(23)\n\n(Similarly for hyperbolic interpolations, replacing sin,\ncos by sinh, cosh) We can now distinguish two cases:\na) If f R\u2032 < ( f R \u2212 f L ) \u2206x , then the l.h.s. of Eq.(23) is\nsmaller than the r.h.s. for m=0 and larger for m=\u03c0/\u2206x.\nClearly, then, there will be one solution of the form\na0(cosmx +Tsinmx), in the acceptable range for m.\nb) If f R\u2032 > ( f R \u2212 f L ) \u2206x , then it is the hyperbolic\nanalogue of Eq.(23) which will have one solution.\n\n3.2\n\nImproved interpolations\n\nThe algorithms described above, although they lead to a\ncontinuous profile with continuous first derivative\nthroughout the horn's length, can be unstable, since a\nsmall change in the slope of one segment may propagate\nand get amplified in the slopes of subsequent segments,\nleading to the appearance of unphysical deformations in\nthe horn's profile. We have tried a number of variants of\nthis approach, starting from either the mouth or the\nthroat of the horn, or from a middle segment.\nNext we tried a variant of the above algorithms which is\nparallel, rather than sequential, in the segments, and\nthus avoids any accumulation of deformations. The\nbasic idea in this variant is to render each segment more\nand more concave or convex in a gradual manner, so as\nto realize a better match at end points. The procedure\nstops when further improvement of matching in one\nendpoint spoils matching at the other endpoint. This\nvariant, while it avoids accumulation of any unphysical\ndeformations, does not lead to an exact matching of\nwave fronts, especially near inflection points.\nOur final interpolation algorithm, at the expense of\nbeing more complicated, avoids the above problems: It\nis parallel and leads to exact derivative matching\nthroughout. In particular, we take a weighted average of\nthe straight line slopes on both sides of a junction point\nand require that the derivatives of the interpolating\nfunctions on either side of the junction match this\naverage. Our algorithm, in a nutshell, works as follows:\n\u25aa Each segment [xL, xR] is split into two subsegments at\nsome intermediate point x0, to be determined. In each\nsubsegment, a hyperbolic (or sinusoidal, according to a\ncertain criterion) interpolating function FL,R(x) is used.\n\u25aa Matching of profile values and derivatives is required\nat xL, x0, xR. This amounts to six conditions on the six\ninterpolating parameters.\n\n\fForum Acusticum 2005 Conference\n\n\u25aa The correct choice of hyperbolic versus sinusoidal\ninterpolating function can be elucidated based on\nFigure 1: We denote by f \u2032 the straight line slope in the\nsegment [xL, xR], and by f L\u2032 , f R\u2032 the weighted slopes at\nthe left and right endpoints, which must be matched by\nour interpolating functions. The following cases arise:\na) f L\u2032 > f \u2032 , f R\u2032 > f \u2032 : FL(x) sinusoidal, FR(x) hyperbolic\nb) f L\u2032 < f \u2032 , f R\u2032 < f \u2032 : FR(x) sinusoidal, FL(x) hyperbolic\nc) f R\u2032 > f \u2032 > f L\u2032 : This is the case shown in Figure 1. The\nsegments with slopes f L\u2032 , f R\u2032 are extended until\nthey intersect at some point xI. Let us consider the\ncase xI > x0. FL(x) and FR(x) will be joined at some\npoint which will certainly be between P and P', if\ntheir derivatives are to be equal, since\nFL\u2032 ( x ) \u2212 FR\u2032 ( x ) < 0 ( > 0) if FL(x) and FR(x) are made\nto pass through P (P'). In all cases, FR(x) lies above\nthe segment with slope f R\u2032 , and is thus hyperbolic.\nTo determine what type of function FL(x) is, we\nmust check whether FL(x) and FR(x) will meet\nabove or below P\": If FR(x) (when it is made to\npass through P\") satisfies FR\u2032 (x 0 ) > f L\u2032 , then FL(x)\nand FR(x) will have to be joined above P\" and\nconsequently FL(x) will be hyperbolic, otherwise it\nwill be sinusoidal. Similar considerations apply to\nthe symmetric cases: xI < x0, f R\u2032 < f \u2032 < f L\u2032 .\n\nFigure 1: Criteria for the choice of interpolating\nfunctions\n\nFigure 2: Comparison of the profile's details for a\nDolnet type clarinet, around a junction point, using the\nconical and transcendental interpolations (radius a vs.\naxis coordinate x, both measured in meters)\n\nSkouroupathis, Panagopoulos\n\nOur algorithms for determining the optimal interpolations have been worked out in Mathematica, and are\navailable from the authors upon request. They have the\nform of a module which takes as input a list of profile\nvalues at different points along the horn's axis, and\nreturns lists of interpolating functions for each segment.\nThe difference between the conical and our optimized\ntranscendental interpolation is exemplified in Figure 2,\nwhich shows a detail from the profile of a Dolnet type\nclarinet, around a junction point.\n\n3.3 Results on impedance\nAll of our results refer to a Dolnet type of clarinet.\nFigure 3 exhibits the spectrum of the impedance using\nthe conical approximation. Figure 4 gives a comparison\nof conical and exponential approximations, as regards\nimpedance. Differences in impedance are relatively\nsmall, of the order of 2% (10%) for the real (imaginary)\npart, in the audible range; resonance frequencies in the\ntwo approximations are practically identical (< 0.5 Hz).\nFigure 5 displays results on impedance, for conical and\ntranscendental approximations. The frequency range\nshown is well beyond the audible threshold, but the\nfunctional behavior of impedance at these frequencies is\n\nFigure 3: Impedance spectrum (real part, SI units) for a\nDolnet clarinet, in the conical approximation\n\nFigure 4: Impedance spectrum (real part, SI units), for\nthe conical and exponential approximation\n\n\fForum Acusticum 2005 Conference\n\nFigure 5: Impedance (imaginary part, SI units) as a\nfunction of frequency, for conical and transcendental\napproximations, in the range 90-100 kHz.

Figure 6 illustrates\nthe impedance as a function of frequency and\ntemperature. The effect of these parameters is viewed\nclearly from a top view, as in Figure 7. One observes\nthat impedance maxima are displaced with temperature,\nand more so at higher frequencies. Figure 8 exhibits the\nvariation of lowest resonances with temperature.\n\n4\nMouthpiece model \u2013 Reflection\nfunction \u2013 Schumacher's equation\nWe employed a standard mathematical description of a\nsingle-reed mouthpiece [3], which is quite realistic and\nsimple.

The model is seen in Figure 9.\nFigure 6: Impedance (real part, SI units) of a Dolnet\nclarinet as a function of frequency and temperature\n\nFigure 9: Mouthpiece of a single-reed woodwind\nIf Pm is the static pressure in the player's mouth, the\nacoustic flow U(t) entering the instrument is related to\nthe pressure difference Pm \u2013 p(t) by Bernoulli's law\nFigure 7: Clarinet impedance (real part, SI units) as\nfunction of frequency and temperature.

The\nshort range of r(t) implies that only recent values of p(t)\ncontribute to the value of p(t) in the present.\n\nFigure 10: r(t), for a Dolnet clarinet. Comparison\nbetween conical and transcendental interpolation\n\nOur algorithm for time evolution proceeds as follows:\n\u25aa At time t = t1 (and at all previous times 0 \u2264 t < t1) the\nvalues of UIN(t1), Ur(t1), U(t1), p(t1) and y(t1) are known\n\u25aa From Eqs.(26), (27) we find Ur(t2), y(t2) (t2 = t1+\u2206t)\n\u25aa Substituting in Eq.(28) we calculate p(t2)\nFor the correct functioning of the algorithm we must\ninvestigate which are the proper initial conditions,\ncompatible with the physical model.

We\nhave performed a thorough analytic check that such\npathologies will never be present. Figure 10 compares\nthe conical and transcendental interpolations, regarding\nour results for r(t). A smoother behavior is observed\ncoming from the transcendental interpolation. Figure 11\ndisplays the pressure evolution in time; one can observe\ntransient phenomena at initial times. Differences among\nvarious interpolations are not perceptible on this scale.\nWhile the observed differences among the various types\nof interpolation which we have examined are small,\nthey are expected to be more pronounced in pipes of\nmore complicated geometry. In particular, it is\nimportant to examine transverse variations in pressure\nand to carry over a similar approach to pipes with\nbends. Similarly, the effect of finger holes should be\ndealt with in a more precise way than standard\ntreatments.
