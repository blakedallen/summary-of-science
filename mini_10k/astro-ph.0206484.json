This emission process\nis believed to be responsible for the nonthermal X-ray (SN 1006, Cas A, Tycho,\nG347.3-0.5, IC443, G266.2-1.2, RCW86) and TeV \u03b3-ray (SN 1006, Cas A, G347.30.5) emission observed recently from a number of SNRs.\nModel for synchrotron X-rays from shell SNRs developed up to now [1, 2] works\nwith uniform magnetic field and is based on the simple spherical Sedov model [3]\nfor SNR hydrodynamics. The most essential simplifications of the Sedov model are\nthe uniform interstellar medium and spherical SN explosion.\nObservations certify that SNRs are nonspherical objects with complicated distributions of surface brightness. The nonuniform interstellar medium are the most\nimportant factor in modification of the structure and evolution of SNRs. We present\nhere a model for the synchrotron emission from shell SNR in nonuniform medium\nand nonuniform magnetic field. This model is a generalization of the model [1, 2].\n\n2\n\nModel for synchrotron emission from nonspherical SNR in nonuniform magnetic field\n1\n\n\f2.1\n\nHydrodynamics\n\nThe position R(\u03b8, \u03c6) and velocity D(\u03b8, \u03c6) of the shock front as well as the distribution of gas parameters inside the volume of SNR depend on the ambient density\ndistribution \u03c1o (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) and anisotropy of the supernova explosion energy Esn (\u03b8, \u03c6).\nIt is enough to have parameters of gas within R(\u03b8, \u03c6) calculated to model the thermal X-ray emission of SNR. Besides \u03c1o (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) and Esn (\u03b8, \u03c6), the synchrotron image\nand spectrum of SNR are also affected by the distribution of interstellar magnetic\nfield Bo (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) which may also be nonuniform.\nIt is assumed hereafter that SNR are on the adiabatic phase of evolution. The\ndynamics of the shock front of nonspherical adiabatic SNR and the distribution of gas\nparameters inside whole shocked volume can be described with the hydrodynamic\nmethod presented in [4]. In this method, a three-dimensional (3-D) object is divided\non a number of 1-D sectors and the distributions of parameters are found separately\nfor each of them. Note, that the velocity of flow is radial in the hydrodynamic\nmethod [4] and the direction of a sector and electron velocity in it are given by the\nsame angles (\u03b8, \u03c6) of a spherical coordinate system with the origin in the place of\nexplosion.\nWe assume also that \u03b3 = 5/3, shock compression ratio \u03c3 = 4, gyrofactor \u03b7 = 1,\nBCMB /Bo \u2192 0, maximum energy attained before the adiabatic stage Emax,0 = 0 (see\n[2] for details). We do not consider the effect of the cosmic ray pressure what can\nchange \u03c3.\n\n2.2\n\nEmission\n\nThe synchrotron volume emissivity of a fluid element (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) is [5]\n(\u03b1+1)/2 \u2212(\u03b1\u22121)/2\n\nS\u03bd = C(\u03b1)KB\u22a5\n\n\u03bd\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere C(\u03b1) is a constant, B\u22a5 is the tangential component of the magnetic field\n(perpendicular to the electron velocity in the fluid element), \u03bd is a frequency, K is\nthe normalization of the sharply truncated electron distribution\nN(E)dE =\n\n(\n\nKE \u2212\u03b1 dE, E \u2264 Emax\n0,\n\nE > Emax\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\nLet us consider the distribution of the emission parameters over the shell and\ntheir evolution downstream.\n2.2.1\n\nSpectral index\n\nThe power index \u03b1 is constant downstream because electrons lose energy proportionally to their energy (Eq. (10)) and remain essentially confined to the fluid element\nin which they were produced. The power index \u03b1 is also constant over the surface\nof a nonspherical SNR because the shock is strong. Namely, in the first order Fermi\nacceleration mechanism, \u03b1 = (\u03c3 + 2)/(\u03c3 \u2212 1), where the shock compression ratio \u03c3\ndoes not depend on the ambient density distribution in the strong shock limit (Mach\nnumber \u226b 1) realized in SNRs: \u03c3 = \u03c1s /\u03c1os = (\u03b3 + 1)/(\u03b3 \u2212 1), the subscripts \"s\" and\n\"o\" refer to the values at the shock and to the surrounding medium respectively.\n2\n\n\f2.2.2\n\nMagnetic field components\n\nThe components of the magnetic field evolve differently behind the shock: B\u22a5 rises\neverywhere at the shock by the same factor \u03c3 = \u03c1s /\u03c1os and Bk is not modified by the\nshock [1]:\n\u03c1s\no\no\nB\u22a5,s = B\u22a5,s\n* o , Bk,s = Bk,s\n.\n(3)\n\u03c1s\nNo further turbulent amplification of the magnetic field is assumed.\nDownstream variation of the components follows from the flux-freezing condition\no\nB\u22a5 (r)rdr = B\u22a5\n(a)ada, continuity equation \u03c1(r)r 2 dr = \u03c1o (a)a2 da and magnetic flux\n2\nconservation r Bk (r) = a2 Bko (a), where a is Lagrangian and r = r(a, t) is Eulerian\ncoordinates.

The calculation of \u0398o depend on the way how the distribution\nBo (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) is given.\nIf we know distributions of Bo (r, \u03b8, \u03c6), \u03b8H (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) and \u03c6H (r, \u03b8, \u03c6), where (\u03b8H , \u03c6H )\nare the spherical angles of the vector Bo in the point (r, \u03b8, \u03c6), then\ncos \u0398o = sin \u03b8 sin \u03b8H cos(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6H ) + | cos \u03b8 cos \u03b8H |.\n\n(16)\n\nThere are three independent of a coordinate system angles in our task: the\ninclination angle \u03b4 between the line of sight and the density gradient, the aspect\nangle \u03c6 between the line of sight and the ambient magnetic field, and the third\nangle \u03be between the magnetic field and the density gradient.\nLet as consider two interesting particular cases.\ni). If direction of the ambient magnetic field is uniform, i.e. \u03c6(r, \u03b8, \u03c6) = const,\nthen let us accept that the origin of the coordinates coincides with the place of\nexplosion, the axis x of Cartesian coordinate system is oriented opposite to the\ndirection of the line of sight (toward observer) and that Bo lies in the plane (xz).\nIn such a case cos \u0398o is given by (16) with \u03b8H = \u03c0/2 \u2212 \u03c6 and \u03c6H = 0.\nii). If direction of the density gradient is uniform, i.e. \u03b4(r, \u03b8, \u03c6) = const, then let\nus accept that the origin of the coordinates coincides with the place of explosion,\naxis z of Cartesian coordinate system is oriented opposite to the density gradient\nand the line of sight lies in the plane (xz). Geometrical consideration yields for\n\u03b4 6= 0 and \u03be 6= 0\ncos \u0398o = sin \u03b8 sin \u03be cos(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6H ) + | cos \u03b8 cos \u03be|,\ncos \u03c6 \u2212 | cos \u03b4 cos \u03be|\nwhere cos \u03c6H =\n.\nsin \u03b4 sin \u03be\n\n(17)\n\nIf \u03b4 = 0 or \u03c0 (grad\u03c1o is parallel to the line of sight) but \u03be 6= 0, then \u03b8H = \u03c0 \u2212 \u03be\nand \u2212\u03be respectively, and additionaly \u03c6H (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) should be known. If \u03be = 0 or \u03c0\n(direction of Bo coincides with grad\u03c1o ), then \u0398o = \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8 or \u03b8 respectively.\n\n3\n\nConclusions\n\nThe model for the synchrotron emission of nonspherical SNR in nonuniform interstellar magnetic field is presented. Being applied to studies of high energy emission\nof SNRs, in particular to X-rays, it allows as to analyse the thermal and synchrotron\nX-ray images and spectra of the objects, to make conclusions about the SNR itself,\nsupernova explosion, structure and properties of the interstellar medium, shock wave\nphysics, acceleration processes on the shocks, \u03b3-ray and cosmic ray generation.\n\nReferences\n[1] Reynolds S., Chevalier R., Astroph.
