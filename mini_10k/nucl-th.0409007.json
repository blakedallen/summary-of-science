Starting from a self-consistent\nmodel using Skyrme interactions, we analyze the resulting modifications of the deformation energy,\nthe fission barrier height, the excitation energy of the superdeformed minimum associated with the\nfission isomer, the structure of the lowest rotational bands with normal deformation and superdeformation, and the corresponding quadrupole moments and transition moments. We present results\nobtained with the Skyrme interactions SLy4 and SLy6, which have slightly different surface tensions.\nPACS numbers: 21.60.Jz, 21.30.Fe, 21.10.-k, 27.90.+b\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nMicroscopic mean-field methods [1] are particularly\nwell suited to describe nuclei with a well defined shape.\nWhen the energy of a nucleus depends softly on a shape\ndegree of freedom or presents several minima as a function of this shape, correlations beyond mean field can affect the properties of the ground state strongly. In such\ncases, the two most relevant types of correlations are associated with the rotation of the nucleus and with its\nvibrations with respect to deformation. The inclusion of\nrotational correlations can be performed by a symmetry\nrestoration and that of vibrations by a mixing of meanfield states corresponding to different shapes. In both\ncases, this requires to go beyond mean-field models.\nWe have recently developed a method which achieves\nthese goals [2]. Applications have been carried out for\nneutron-deficient Pb isotopes [3, 4]. The low-energy spectrum of these nuclei varies rapidly with neutron number with states exhibiting strong mixing between oblate,\nspherical and prolate configurations. Qualitative properties of their spectra, including transition properties,\nwere nicely explained. However, since the results depend\nstrongly on the amount of mixing between several configurations, a detailed agreement with the data has not\nbeen achieved.\nA very different situation occurs when the mean-field\napproximation is better justified as a first approximation,\nsuch as when coexisting states lie in well separated energy minima. This is the case at low excitation energies\nfor superdeformed bands in nuclei around Hg and for fission isomers [5]. Nevertheless, it is only using beyond\nmean-field models that one can calculate spectra with\nwell defined spin assignments as well as the corresponding transition probabilities.\nThe nucleus 240 Pu has often been used as a benchmark\nto study mean-field theories and effective interactions.\nWe present here an application of our method to this\nnucleus. It will allow us to address the following issues:\n(i) are quadrupole correlations influencing a wellTypeset by REVTEX\n\ndeformed nucleus a priori well-described by mean-field\ncalculations?\n(ii) how does the exact angular momentum projection\nmodify the fission barrier and the excitation energy of\nfission isomers?\n(iii) how much do the predictions depend upon different parameterizations of the effective interaction?\nIn what follows, we shortly recall the basic ingredients\nof the theory, then we present our results for the spectrum\nof 240 Pu in the ground state and the superdeformed well.\nThe fission barrier obtained with two different effective\ninteractions is discussed and compared with earlier, more\nphenomenological, approaches.\n\nII.\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nThe starting point of our method is a set of HF+BCS\nwave functions generated by self-consistent mean-field\ncalculations with a constraint on a collective coordinate, the axial quadrupole moment q = hQ20 i in the\npresent study. In the language of the spherical nuclear\nshell model, such mean-field states incorporate particleparticle (pairing) correlations as well as many-particle\nmany-hole correlations by allowing deformations of the\nnucleus in its intrinsic frame. As a consequence, the\nmean-field states break several symmetries of the exact\nmany-body states. This symmetry violation makes it difficult to relate mean-field results to spectroscopic data\nwhich are obtained in the laboratory frame of reference.\nThe second step of our method is a restoration of the symmetries associated with particle numbers and rotation.\nAnother ambiguity in the interpretation of mean-field\nresults arises from the non-orthogonality of mean-field\nstates corresponding to different quadrupole moments,\nso that different minima in a potential landscape cannot\nalways be safely associated with different physical states.\nThis difficulty is resolved in the third step of our method\nby variational mixing of symmetry-restored mean-field\nstates corresponding to different quadrupole moments.\n\n\f2\nThe method that we use is a discretized version of the\ngenerator coordinate method. It removes the contribution of vibrational excitations to the ground state and,\nat the same time, permits to construct a spectrum of\nexcited states.\nIn our method, the same effective interaction is used to\ngenerate the mean-field states and to perform the configuration mixing. We present below results obtained with\ntwo different Skyrme interactions, SLy4 and SLy6 [6]. In\nboth cases a density-dependent zero-range interaction is\nused in the pairing channel. We use the same strength\nas in previous studies, \u22121250 MeV fm3 and two cutoffs,\nabove and below the Fermi energy, as defined in Ref. [7].\nThe two Skyrme parameterizations differ mostly by their\nsurface tension: the surface energy coefficient obtained\nfrom Hartree-Fock calculations of semi-infinite nuclear\nmatter is lower for SLy6, 17.74 MeV, than for SLy4,\n18.37 MeV [8]. Such a difference is expected to affect\nsignificantly the deformation energy at large quadrupole\nmoments. Both parameterizations have been fitted in an\nidentical way. Their differences have their origin in a\ndifferent choice for the treatment of the spurious centerof-mass motion (c.m.): a fully variational c.m. one for\nSLy6 and a simpler one-body approximation for SLy4.\nThe energy differences due to these two schemes induce\nslight differences in the properties of the interactions, see\nRef. [9] for a detailed discussion.\nAs our main goal is an investigation of the overall effect of symmetry restoration and configuration mixing in\na heavy, well-deformed nucleus, we restrict ourselves to\naxial and reflection-symmetric shape degrees of freedom.\nIt has been shown that the fission barrier height obtained\nwith SLy6 is in agreement with experiment within 1 MeV\nwhen octupole deformation is taken into account [1].\nOur method has many interesting properties. Its\nsole phenomenological ingredient is the effective nucleonnucleon interaction, which has been adjusted once and\nfor all on generic nuclear properties. From a numerical\npoint of view, it is simple enough to be applied throughout the mass table up to superheavy nuclei, utilizing the\nfull model space of single-particle states with the proper\ncoupling to the continuum. Another attractive aspect of\nthe method is that it allows to determine electric transition probabilities directly in the laboratory frame between any pair of states. Finally, the method has the\nadvantage that its results can be interpreted within the\nintuitive picture of intrinsic shapes and shells of singleparticle states that is offered by the framework of meanfield models. More details on the method can be found\nin Refs. [2, 4].\nSpectroscopic quadrupole moments and B(E\u03bb ) values\nare determined directly in the laboratory frame of reference [10]. To connect our results with other approaches,\nit is interesting to derive quantities analogous to intrinsic frame parameters from spectroscopic or transition mo(t)\nments.

Among them, the double-humped\nfission barrier of 240 Pu has been used as a benchmark\nfor mean-field models and effective interactions. First\ncalculations were performed with Skyrme forces and the\nHartree-Fock+BCS method [13], with the Gogny force\nand the HFB method [14] or with relativistic Lagrangians\n\n\f3\n\n.\n.\n\n.\n\nFIG. 2: Same as Figure 1, for the interaction SLy6.\n\nand the relativistic mean-field method (RMF) [15]. Semiclassical approximations of the mean-field method were\nperformed with different Skyrme forces in ref [16, 17].\nSeveral Skyrme interactions and RMF Lagrangians were\ncompared to the data in [18]. Axial and triaxial barriers\nobtained with Skyrme, Gogny and RMF forces are compared in Ref. [1]. Finally, the excitation energy of fission\nisomers has been studied with a variety of Skyrme forces\nin Ref. [5, 19].\nThe deformation energy curves obtained after particlenumber projection and particle-number + angularmomentum projection on J = 0 are presented in Figures\n1 and 2 for SLy4 and SLy6 interactions. For all curves,\nthe energy of the ground state is taken as zero. The\nground state and the fission isomer after projection are\nobtained from the mean-field minima. With the normalization that we have chosen to plot the results, the gain\nof energy obtained for the ground state by angular momentum projection is given by the difference between the\ncurves at spherical shape. This gain is around 3.0 MeV\nfor both interactions, bringing the calculated total energy\ncloser to the experimental one.\nThe fission isomer is obtained at a \u03b22 value around 0.9;\nangular-momentum projection lowers its excitation energy by about 1 MeV for both forces, from 4.3 to 3.3 MeV\nfor SLy4, and from 2.6 to 1.6 MeV for SLy6.\nB.\n\nRotational energy\n\nAngular momentum projection provides the exact correction for the spurious rotational energy of the meanfield states. It is given by the difference between the\nbinding energies before and after projection on angular\nmomentum J = 0\nErot (\u03b22 ) = Emf (\u03b22 ) \u2212 EJ=0 (\u03b22 ).\n\n(4)\n\nThis difference does not depend much on the Skyrme parameterization and is plotted in the lower panel of Fig. 3\nfor SLy4.

A similar behavior has been obtained in most of\nour previous calculations [4, 10]. The topology of the fission barrier is not much affected by angular momentum\nprojection. The height of the second barrier is decreased\nby about 800 keV with respect to the fission isomer and\nby 1.5 MeV with respect to the ground state.\nRotational corrections are sometimes incorporated\nphenomenologically as a perturbation to mean-field calculations. In particular, it is an ingredient in the mass\nformulae based on Skyrme forces [20]. In the same way,\nthe fission barrier of 240 Pu including a rotational correction was used as a constraint in the fit of the Gogny\ninteraction [14].

(6) runs over the single-particle states\n|i) and |j) in a given deformed mean-field state, and Ei\nand Ej are the corresponding quasi-particle energies. For\nthe large-scale mass fits of Ref. [20], the actual moment\nof inertia taken is a mixture of Eq. (6) and of the rigidbody moment of inertia. More involved approximations\nfor the moment of inertia have been developed, see e.g.\n[21, 22] and references therein, but are rarely used. We\ncan extract a moment of inertia from our projected meanfield calculations using the energy difference between the\nenergy curves for J = 0 and J = 2 as\nEJ=I (\u03b22 ) \u2212 EJ=0 (\u03b22 ) =\n\n~2 I(I + 1)\n.\n2\u0398(\u03b22 )\n\n(7)\n\nIn Fig. 3, we compare the exact and approximate rotational energies as a function of deformation. We also\nshow the angular momentum dispersion of the meanfield wave functions and the moment of inertia given by\nEqn. (6) and obtained from the 2+ excitation energy.\nBoth of these moments of inertia are rather close for deformations around that of the fission isomer. For lower\ndeformations, the Belyaev moment of inertia is significantly larger than the \"exact\" one. For larger deformations, the Belyaev moment does not increase as rapidly\nas the one extracted from our calculation. The dispersion of the angular momentum of the mean-field wave\nfunction increases also with deformation in a way which\n\nis partly compensated by the increase of the Belyaev\nmoment of inertia. However, this compensation is not\nstrong enough and the Belyaev rotational energy correction overestimates at large deformations the energy\ncorrection obtained by exact projection. Note that this\ncorrection varies only by 1.5 MeV from the deformation\ncorresponding to the ground state to the external fission\nbarrier.\n\nC.\n\nConfiguration mixing\n\nThe properties of the four lowest states obtained from\nthe configuration mixing calculation are given in Table I\nfor SLy4 and Table II for SLy6. The corresponding collective wave functions are shown in Figure 4 for the SLy4\ninteraction. The states separate nicely into four rotational bands, two located in the prolate normal-deformed\n(ND) minimum, and two in the superdeformed (SD) one.\nThe wave functions are all confined within either the ND\nor the SD wells. States obtained with SLy6 are similar,\nexcept for an overall shift in the excitation energies of\nthe states located in the superdeformed well; the SD 0+\nband-head has an excitation energy of 2.99 MeV with\nSLy4 and 1.25 MeV with SLy6. The actual experimental value is in between the two, although there are some\nconflicting values given in the literature 2.4 \u00b1 0.3 MeV\n[11], \u2248 2.8 MeV [23] and 2.25 \u00b1 0.20 MeV [24].\nThe band head of the second ND band is obtained\nat 3.79 MeV for both forces. Similarly, the excitation\nenergy of the second SD band with respect to the first\nSD band head is 1.39 MeV for SLy4 and 1.27 MeV for\nSLy6. This suggests that the excitation energies within a\nwell are fairly independent from the surface tension of the\nSkyrme force. Both interactions give also similar values\n\n\f5\nstate\n\n(s)\n\n(s)\n\nE\nQs Q0 \u03b22\n(MeV) (e b) (e b)\n\n(t)\n\n(t)\n\nB(E2)\u2193 Q0 \u03b22\n(e2 b2 ) (e b)\n\n0+\n1\n2+\n1\n4+\n1\n\n0.000\n0.083\n0.277\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n-3.4 11.9 0.300\n-4.3 11.9 0.300\n\n\u2013\n2.80\n4.00\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n11.9 0.300\n11.9 0.300\n\n0+\n3\n2+\n3\n4+\n3\n\n3.793\n3.880\n4.088\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n-3.4 11.9 0.301\n-4.3 12.0 0.303\n\n\u2013\n2.82\n4.07\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n11.9 0.301\n12.0 0.302\n\n0+\n2\n2+\n2\n4+\n2\n\n2.953\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n2.978 -10.3 36.0 0.911\n3.045 -13.1 36.0 0.911\n\n\u2013\n25.8\n36.8\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n36.0 0.911\n36.0 0.911\n\n0+\n4\n2+\n4\n4+\n4\n\n4.338\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n4.364 -10.4 36.5 0.922\n4.429 -13.3 36.5 0.922\n\n\u2013\n26.4\n37.8\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n36.5 0.922\n36.5 0.922\n\nTABLE I: Properties of the rotational bands of 240 Pu\nobtained with SLy4: excitation energy E, spectroscopic\nquadrupole moment Qs , corresponding quadrupole moment\n(s)\n(s)\nQ0 and dimensionless deformation \u03b22 in the intrinsic frame,\nreduced E2 transition probability B(E2)\u2193, and corresponding\n(t)\n(t)\nquadrupole moment Q0 and dimensionless deformation \u03b22\nin the intrinsic frame.\nstate\n\n(s)\n\n(s)\n\n\u03b22\nE\nQs Q0\n(MeV) (e b) (e b)\n\n(t)\n\n(t)\n\n\u03b22\nB(E2)\u2193 Q0\n(e2 b2 ) (e b)\n\n0+\n1\n2+\n1\n4+\n1\n\n0.000\n0.083\n0.273\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n-3.4 11.9 0.300\n-4.3 11.9 0.301\n\n\u2013\n2.81\n4.02\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n11.9 0.300\n11.9 0.301\n\n0+\n4\n2+\n4\n4+\n4\n\n3.794\n3.879\n4.082\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n-3.4 12.0 0.304\n-4.4 12.1 0.306\n\n\u2013\n2.88\n4.15\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n12.0 0.304\n12.1 0.305\n\n0+\n2\n2+\n2\n4+\n2\n\n1.251\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n1.277 -10.4 36.3 0.916\n1.338 -13.2 36.3 0.917\n\n\u2013\n26.1\n37.4\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n36.2 0.915\n36.3 0.916\n\n0+\n3\n2+\n3\n4+\n3\n\n2.519\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n2.550 -10.5 36.7 0.928\n2.611 -13.4 36.7 0.928\n\n\u2013\n27.0\n38.3\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n36.8 0.931\n36.7 0.928\n\nTABLE II: The same as Table I, but for SLy6.\n\nfor the excitation energies within the bands.\nThe ground state band is known up to very high spin\n[25, 26, 27]. It has been suggested that static octupole deformation plays a role to explain the behaviour at large\nangular momentum Ref. [26, 28]. States below the 6+\ndecay mainly by internal electron conversion, so the corresponding transitions have not been detected in \u03b3-ray\nspectroscopy.\nThe lowest levels in the ground-state band are reported\nin the NUDAT data base [29] at 42.824 (2+ ), 141.690\n(4+ ), and 294.319 keV (6+ ). Our calculation overestimates these energies by almost a factor two. The experimental energies in the SD well are 20.1 keV for the 2+\n\nand 66.8 keV for the 4+ for the SD1 band, and 769.9\n(0+ ), 785.1 (2+ ), and 825.0 keV (4+ ) for the SD2 band.\nThey are also overestimated by our model. On the contrary, the calculated B(E2; 2+ \u2192 0+ ) value is in excellent agreement with the experimental one of 26660 \u00b1 360\ne2 fm4 obtained from Coulomb excitation [30].\nA similar overestimation of excitation energies has\nbeen found for other nuclei with our model [2, 4] and\nin a similar framework using a Gogny interaction [31].\nA hint on a possible origin of this discrepancy can be\nfound from cranked mean-field calculations. In this case,\nneither configuration mixing nor restoration of symmetries are performed. However, time-reversal invariance\nis broken and the mean-field potential is optimised for\neach J value and not only for J = 0. An unprojected\ncranked HFB calculation [32] using the same effective interaction as here gives excitation energies for the groundstate band of 0.030 (2+ ), 0.121 (4+ ) and 0.271 MeV (6+ ),\nrespectively, in much better agreement with the data.\nLooking at Figure 4 one can see that, within a band, the\namplitudes of the collective wave functions for different\nJ values differ by less than 1% for each deformation. The\nwave functions for different J values are therefore probably too close to each other in our model. The slight\nbreaking of time-reversal symmetry of mean-field states\nsubject to a cranking constraint might be sufficient to\nprovide a better starting point for exact projection and\nconfiguration mixing for the J different from 0 states.\nThe deformation of the ground state stays remarkably\nconstant at all levels of approximations: from \u03b22 = 0.29\nfor the minima of the mean-field and projected energy\n(s)\ncurves to \u03b22 (2+ ) = 0.30 as deduced from Eqn. (3) for\nboth the spectroscopic and the transition quadrupole moments. All these deformations agree with the one deduced from the experimental B(E2) value, \u03b22 = 0.29.\n(s)\n(t)\nSince we obtain nearly equal \u03b22 and \u03b22 values all\nalong the bands, the use of the rotor model is well justified to describe the four bands.\nWe obtain also very large E0 transition matrix elements between states in the same well. With SLy4,\n+\nthe M (E0; 0+\n3 \u2192 01 ) in the first well has a value of\n2\n-29 e fm corresponding to \u03c1(E0) = \u22120.52, while the\n+\n2\nthe M (E0; 0+\n4 \u2192 02 ) in the second well is 87 e fm ,\nor \u03c1(E0) = 1.6. As our model predicts the collective\nwave functions of all members of a rotational band to be\nvery similar, the transition moments are calculated to be\nvery similar as well for all E0 transitions within a band.\nThe values obtained with the SLy6 interation differ only\nmarginally from those of SLy4. The E0 matrix elements\nthat we obtain for transitions between states in the SD\nand the normal-deformed well are very small.\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION AND SUMMARY\n\nThe inclusion of correlations beyond mean-field confirms that many properties of the 240 Pu nucleus are already well described at the mean-field level of approxima-\n\n\f6\ntion. The overall structure of the potential energy curve\nis not altered by angular momentum projection, with a\nwell defined prolate ground state and a fission isomer in\nnarrow potential wells. Thanks to that, the properties of\nthe lowest state in each well after configuration mixing\nare very close to the properties of the mean-field minima. The ground-state and fission isomer wave functions\nhave a Gaussian shape and do not spread much around\ntheir respective minima. The superdeformed minimum\nin the potential energy surface is, however, too wide to\nconfine completely the wave functions of the lowest SD\nband which are more spread, but still of Gaussian shape.\nAs expected, the total binding energy is slightly increased by angular momentum projection, and thereby\ncomes closer to the experimental value. Compared to\nthe ground state, angular-momentum projection lowers\nthe (axial) inner barrier by about 0.6 MeV, the fission\nisomer by about 1 MeV, and the (reflection-symmetric)\nouter barrier by about 2 MeV. These changes of the\npotential landscape are going in the same direction as\na decrease of the surface tension of the effective meanfield interaction and should therefore be considered when\npredicting superdeformed band heads and fission barrier\nheights. The schematic rotational correction used in the\nliterature gives a too large reduction of the fission barrier\nheights by at least 2 MeV.\nThe energy of the superdeformed fission isomer turns\nout to be too low with SLy6, while for SLy4 it is slightly\ntoo high. We obtained similar results for SD band heads\nof Pb isotopes in the A \u2248 190 region [5]. This suggests,\nthat the surface tension might be too low for SLy6, while\n\nit is slightly too high for SLy4. This is apparently in contradiction with Ref. [9], where it was argued on the basis\nof pure mean-field calculations for 240 Pu, that the surface\ntension of SLy6 is more realistic than that of SLy4. However, surface tension is not the only ingredient responsible for the energy of superdeformed states, as their existence is usually caused by a shell effect. Unfortunately, it\nis hard to disentangle the contribution from the macroscopic properties of the forces from the shell structure\nwhich is also not identical for SLy4 and SLy6 at large\ndeformations.\n\n[1] M.

While we obtain quite good results\nfor E2 transition moments and deformations, neither the\nexcitation energies of the excited 0+ band heads nor the\nexcitation energies within the bands are well reproduced.\nUnprojected cranked HFB calculations without any additional correlations perform much better for in-band transitions. This strongly suggests to extend our method to\nthe use of such states as a starting set of wave functions. Such a development is currently underway. Using\ncranked mean-field states, however, will not change the\ntoo large excitation energies of 0+ band heads.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by the PAI-P5-07 of the PPS\nScientific Policy.
