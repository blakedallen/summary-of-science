Number counts in the UV, in particular,\ncan help trace the star formation history of the universe. Until recently obtaining faint\ngalaxy number counts in the UV has been difficult due to the small areas surveyed (Gardner,\nBrown, & Ferguson 2000; Deharveng et al. 1994; Iglesias-P\u00e1ramo et al. 2004; Sasseen et al.\n2002; Teplitz et al. 2006). While the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) has allowed for\nthe measurement of UV galaxy number counts over a wide field of view (Xu et al. 2005,\n1\n\nDepartment of Astronomy & Astrophysics, The Pennsylvania State University, 525 Davey Laboratory,\nUniversity Park, PA 16801\n2\n\nPhysics Department, St. Vincent College, Latrobe, PA 15650\n\n3\n\nMullard Space Science Laboratory/UCL, Holmbury St. Mary, Dorking, Surrey RH5 6NT\n\n4\n\nNASA/Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD 20771\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\n\u223c 20 deg2 ), the confusion limit of GALEX restricts the magnitude range covered to 14 to\n23.8 mAB . The deepest UV number counts from HST range from mAB = 23 to 29 over an\nextremely small field of view of \u223c 1.3 square arcminutes.\nHere, we present galaxy number counts obtained in 3 near UV filters (1928 \u00c5, 2246 \u00c5,\n2600\u00c5) as well as in the u band (3645\u00c5) obtained using the Swift UV/Optical Telescope\n(UVOT; Roming et al. 2005). Deep exposures were taken of a 289 square arcminute field\nof view overlapping the Chandra Deep Field South (CDF-S; Giacconi et al. 2002) allowing\nfor the measurement of number counts from mAB = 21 to 26. UVOT data covers the break\nin the slope of the NUV number counts with greater precision than the existing GALEX\nand HST number counts. We use the UVOT number counts to explore the evolution of\nstar-forming galaxies out to z \u223c 1.\n2.\n\nData & Analysis\n\nThe CDF-S was observed with UVOT, one of three telescopes onboard the Swift spacecraft (Gehrels et al. 2004), the primary mission of which is to study gamma-ray bursts\n(GRB). The UVOT is a 30 cm telescope with f -ratio 12.7 (Roming et al. 2005). It has\ntwo grisms and seven broadband filters. The central wavelengths and widths of the uvw2,\nuvm2, uvw1, and u filters used in this paper can be found in Table 1. For a more detailed\ndiscussion of the filters, as well as plots of the responses, see (Poole et al. 2008).\nObservations of the CDF-S were made between July 7, 2007 and December 29, 2007.\nCDF-S images are unbinned with a pixel scale of 0.5 arcseconds. UVOT data processing\nis described in the UVOT Software Guide1 . The data were processed with a version of the\nUVOT pipeline in which exposure maps are aspect corrected. This feature is not currently\navailable for data currently in the archive but will appear in future versions of the pipeline.\nImage files and exposure maps were summed using UVOTIMSUM from the publicly available\nUVOT FTOOLS (HEAsoft 6.6.1)2 . This involves two flux conserving interpolations of the\nimages, the first to convert from the raw frame to sky coordinates, and the second when\nsumming the images. Bad pixels are known and a correction is applied. UVOT, as is\nthe case with all microchannel plate intensified CCDs, is insensitive to cosmic rays. The\nmaximum exposure time in each filter is given in Table 1.\nBecause Swift is optimized for fast slewing to accomplish its GRB mission, the pointing\n1\n\nhttp://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/swift/analysis\n\n2\n\nhttp://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/lheasoft/\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\naccuracy is of order 1 to 2 arcminutes. In addition the requirement that the solar panels face\ntowards the Sun causes the field of view to rotate over the course of the year. As a result\nthe exposure times vary significantly across the summed images. Exposure maps are nearly\nuniform in the center but become complicated on the edges. Table 1 gives the area covered\nwhere the exposure time is at least 98% of the maximum exposure time in each filter.\nThe 98% value was chosen to maximize the area used in this study while simultaneously\nmaintaining a magnitude limited sample.\nThe area in each filter covered by the 98% exposure time criterion is shown in Figure 1.\nFor comparison the area covered by the CDF-S, Hubble Ultra Deep Field (Beckwith et al.\n2006), and Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (Giavalisco et al. 2004) is shown by\nthe labeled contours. A false color image of the central region of the CDF-S using the uvw2,\nuvm2, and uvw1 images is shown in Figure 2.\nPhotometry was performed using SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996), a publicly available code designed for the identification and measurement of astrophysical sources in large\nscale galaxy survey data. A full listing of the SExtractor parameters used is provided in\nthe online version of Table 2. The background map, which measures the local background\ndue to the sky and other sources, was generated internally by SExtractor. To improve the\ndetectability of faint extended sources the filtering option was used with a Gaussian filter.\nThe filter size was selected to match the full width half maximum (FWHM) of the point\nspread function (PSF) as recommended in the SExtractor manual. The PSF was measured\nfrom the CDF-S image for each filter using one star. There was only one star which was\nbright enough and isolated enough to accurately measure the outer regions of the PSF. The\nPSFs used were 3.30\" in uvw2, 2.87\" in uvm2, 2.86\" in uvw1, and 2.67\" in u. Magnitudes\nwere calculated from MAG AUTO which is designed to be the best measure of the total magnitudes of galaxies. SExtractor was used to process count rate images created by dividing\nthe summed images by the exposure map. The resulting output was converted to flux using\nthe values given by Poole et al. (2008) for stellar spectra. The fluxes were then converted\nto AB magnitudes (Oke 1974). The number of sources detected in each band ranges from\n888 to 1260 and is given in Table 1 along with the area covered in each image.\nThe UVOT detector is a microchannel plate intensified CCD which operates in photon\ncounting mode. As such it is subject to coincidence loss which occurs when two or more\nphotons arrive at a the same location on the detector within a single CCD readout interval\nof 11 ms (Fordham, Moorhead, & Galbraith 2000). When this happens only one photon will\nbe counted, which systematically undercounts the true number of photons. The coincidence\nloss correction is at the 1% level for mAB \u223c 19 in the UVOT filters we use in this paper. For\nthe magnitude ranges considered in our number counts the coincidence loss is insignificant\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nand no attempts are made to correct for it.\nBy design the CDF-S is on a line of sight with very low Galactic extinction. In addition\nthe area covered by the UVOT observation is around 130 square arcminutes, depending\non the filter, so variations in extinction across the field are small. According to the dust\nmaps of Schlegel, Finkbeiner, & Davis (1998) the range of Galactic extinction in our field\nis 0.020 \u2264 AV \u2264 0.030. Our photometry is corrected for Galactic extinction based on the\nposition of the source assuming the Milky Way dust curve of Pei (1992). The extinction\ncorrection is largest in the uvm2 filter as it is centered on the 2175 \u00c5 dust feature which is\npronounced in the Milky Way. The extinction correction ranges from 0.053 \u2264 Auvm2 \u2264 0.086\nacross the field in uvm2 which demonstrates that the extinction correction is not a significant\nsource of error in any of the filters.\n\n3.\n\nBias Corrections\n\nThe raw number counts suffer from several biases which need to be quantified. Completeness addresses the inability to detect an object either due to confusion with other sources\nor limitations in the photometry. Eddington bias (Eddington 1913) occurs because magnitude errors will preferentially scatter objects into brighter magnitude bins because there are\ngenerally more objects at fainter magnitudes. There is also the potential for false detections\nof objects due to noise.\nThese first two problems can be addressed simultaneously with a Monte Carlo simulation, following the procedure set out in Smail et al. (1995). For each of the four images,\nsynthetic galaxies were added and the analysis repeated. Synthetic galaxies were placed at\nrandom locations on the image. The magnitudes of the synthetic galaxies were between 21\nand 27 in uvw2, uvm2 and uvw1 and between 20 and 25.5 in u and the relative numbers by\nmagnitude follow the observed distribution from the original SExtractor photometry in the\nrelevant filter. The synthetic galaxies are given exponential profiles with semi-major axes\nand ellipticities that match the observed distribution as a function of magnitude. Individual\nphoton arrivals are modeled using Poisson statistics and following the galaxy profile. The\nresulting image is then convolved with the UVOT PSF for the final image.\nFor each filter a single synthetic galaxy was added to the real image and the photometry process described in \u00a72 was redone. The resulting photometry catalog was checked to\ndetermine if the synthetic galaxy was detected and at what magnitude. This was repeated\n50,000 times for each filter to build up statistics on the completeness. The number counts\nwere corrected by dividing by the fraction of synthetic galaxies detected in the relevant mag-\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nnitude bin. These values are tabulated in Table 3. Following Smail et al. (1995) the number\ncounts are truncated where the completeness correction exceeds 50%. The Poisson error bars\non the number counts are also divided by the completeness correction to take into account\nuncertainties introduced by the completeness correction.\nCorrecting for false detections was also done using the methods of Smail et al. (1995).\nUsing the exposure time and background count rate calculated from the background map\noutput by SExtractor noise frames were simulated for each filter. The photometry methods\ndescribed in \u00a72 were repeated for each frame and the number of false detections recorded\nas a function of magnitude. For each filter 100 noise frames were analyzed. The number\nof spurious sources, Nspur , is shown as a function of magnitude for each filter in Table 3.\nOut of all the simulated frames only one spurious source was detected. Given our deep\nexposures the completeness correction truncates our number counts well before background\nnoise becomes an issue.\nGalaxy number counts can be overestimated due to contamination by Galactic stars\nand quasars. The fraction of objects in the field that are quasars is estimated by position\nmatching the four UVOT photometry catalogs with the Extended Chandra Deep Field South\nX-ray point source catalog (Lehmer et al. 2005). Objects with X-ray detections are assumed\nto be quasars. The number of such sources in each band is 11, 11, 14, and 21 for the uvw2,\nuvm2, uvw1, and u bands respectively. This represents 1.2, 1.0, 1.1, and 2.3% of the total\nsample. These sources have been removed from the number counts. The number of AGN\nper magnitude bin, NAGN , is tabulated in Table 3.\nThe problem of stellar contamination is greatly reduced by the fact that the line of sight\ntowards the CDF-S is out of the plane of the Milky Way. The CDF-S field was explicitly\nchosen to be particularly sparse. As a result the field is a statistical outlier, and the stellar\ncontamination in this field will be unusually low. In addition, the fraction of stars with\nsignificant UV flux is low, particularly when the field points toward the Galactic halo where\nthe stellar population is very old. This is another reason the stellar contamination in the\nthree NUV filters should be low.\nThe contamination due to stars is estimated by position matching the UVOT photometry catalogs with objects in the field with stellar classifications in the COMBO-17 survey\n(Wolf et al. 2004). The COMBO-17 survey includes photometry in 17 passbands for a\n30 \u00d7 30 arcminute field surrounding the CDF-S. It also contains photometric redshifts and\nclassifications of objects in the survey. The UVOT positions were compared with the objects\nclassified as stars or white dwarfs in COMBO-17. This yields 24, 15, and 40 stars in the\nuvw2, uvm2, and uvw1 NUV filters which corresponds to 2.7, 1.4, and 3.2% of the total\nsample. The number of stars per magnitude bin, Nstar is shown in Table 3. Not all NUV\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nnumber counts are corrected for stellar contamination (e.g. Gardner et al. 2000). Given\nthe numbers provided in Table 3 the number counts can easily be recalculated without the\nstellar contamination correction.\nHowever it is different in the u band where more stars have significant fluxes. Position\nmatching yielded 48 stars in the u band which is 5.1% of the total sample. As in the\nNUV counts the stellar contamination has been corrected for and the details are in Table 3.\nCapak et al. (2004) provide both raw number counts and the number counts corrected for\nstellar contamination in the U band from observations around the Hubble Deep Field North\n(HDFN). The u and U filters are comparable, and the HDFN is similar to the CDF-S in\nbeing one of the darkest areas of the sky pointed out of the Galactic disk with low Galactic\nextinction. The level of stellar contamination in Capak et al. (2004) ranges from 66% at\nu = 20 to 6% at u = 25. At the bright end of this scale the values are comparable, but\nat the faint end they are roughly twice as high as in the CDF-S. One possible explanation\nfor this discrepancy is that the Capak et al. (2004) sample covers \u223c 720 arcsec2 compared\nto 137 arcsec2 for this sample. Over this larger area one would expect the number of stars\nto be closer to the average number expected for that line of sight to the halo, while in our\nrelatively smaller area the number of stars can remain a statistical outlier.\nCosmic variance is another potential source of bias which arises due to local inhomogeneities in the Universe. Galaxies are known to cluster on many different length scales.\nAs a result the density of galaxies will differ along different lines of sight. The smaller the\narea covered by a survey the more the results will be biased by cosmic variance. A publicly available code from Trenti & Stiavelli (2008) was used to estimate the errors due to\ncosmic variance in our number counts. This code is based in part on N-body simulations of\ngalaxy structure formation. It uses the area of the survey, mean redshift, range of redshifts\nobserved and the number of objects detected to calculate the error due to cosmic variance.\nThe mean redshift and redshift range of each of our luminosity bins was estimated from the\nmodel number counts described in \u00a74. The results show that the uncertainty due to cosmic\nvariance are of the same order as the Poisson errors for all of the filters and magnitude bins\n\u221a\nused here. We therefore multiply our Poisson errors by a factor of 2 to take into account\nthe effects of cosmic variance.\nThe resulting corrected number counts are shown in Figures 3 (uvw2), 4 (uvm2), 5\n(uvw1), and 6 (u). The number counts are also given in Table 3. In Figures 3, 4, and 5 the\nnumber counts are plotted along side the NUV number counts from GALEX (Xu et al. 2005)\nand STIS (Gardner et al. 2000). A color conversion has been applied to shift the GALEX\nNUV filter and STIS F25QTZ filter in the NUV channel by generating synthetic magnitudes\nfrom a catalog of spectral synthesis models with a range of ages and star formation histories\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nand estimating the typical color offset. The GALEX and STIS NUV filters have very similar\nbandpasses which typically differ by less than 0.01 magnitudes. The uvm2 filter has the\ntightest relationship with the NUV filters with a color correction of 0.013. The spread is\nlarger in the uvw2 and uvw1 filters, but is still only of order 0.05. In Figure 6 the UVOT u\nband number counts are compared to the U band counts of Capak et al. (2004) and ElicheMoral et al. (2006) and the u band measurements of Metcalfe et al. (2001) and Yasuda\net al. (2001). Color corrections to the UVOT u band were determined in the same fashion\nand are equal to 0.81 in U and 0.06 in u.\n\n4.\n\nModels\n\nSimple models of number counts were constructed for both non-evolving and evolving\nluminosity functions in the UVOT filters. For each model the luminosity function is summed\nover redshift. This summation includes two corrections. The first is a filter correction to\nconvert the GALEX NUV filter to the UVOT uvw2, uvm2, and uvw1 filters and the U band\nto the UVOT u filter. The second is a K-correction to convert the observed UVOT filter to\nthe rest-frame UVOT filter. Both of these corrections are a function of redshift.\nThese corrections were calculated using a model galaxy spectrum generated with the\npublicly available P\u00c9GASE spectral synthesis code (Fioc & Rocca-Volmerange 1997). For\nthe uvw2, uvm2, and uvw1 filters a starburst galaxy model was used with a constant star\nformation rate, Solar metallicity, and standard Salpeter IMF at an age of 800 Myr. This was\nchosen to match the model number counts in Xu et al. (2005) which used the SB4 starburst\ntemplate of Kinney et al. (1996) because it most closely matched the ratio of the local FUV\nto NUV luminosity densities described by Wyder et al. (2005). The P\u00c9GASE model is\nvery nearly the SB1 template of Kinney et al. (1996), however we model a range of internal\nextinctions. An \u03a9M = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, H0 = 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 cosmology is used throughout.\nThe u band models were calculated assuming the cosmic spectrum of Baldry et al. (2002)\nin addition to the starburst spectrum . The cosmic spectrum is a luminosity weighted average\nspectrum of galaxies with z . 0.1 which makes it a good choice for a template representative\nof all galaxies. The empirical cosmic spectrum does not extend far enough into the blue to\nbe useful for modeling the UVOT u band let alone passing it through the filters at increasing\nredshifts. To extend the spectrum into the ultraviolet a template spectrum was created in\nP\u00c9GASE from the best fitting parameters given by Baldry et al. (2002). The model number\ncounts were corrected for a range of models of internal extinction. Models were calculated\nfor 0 \u2264 AV \u2264 2 for the Milky Way, LMC, and SMC dust models of Pei (1992) and the\nstarburst dust model of Calzetti, Kinney, & Storchi-Bergmann (1994).\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nGalaxy luminosity functions have traditionally been fit empirically using Schechter functions (Schechter 1976). The Schechter function is given by\n\u03c6(M)dM =\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\nln 10 \u2217 \u0002 0.4(M \u2217 \u2212M ) \u0003\u03b1+1\n\u2217\n\u03c6 10\nexp \u2212100.4(M \u2212M ) dM\n2.5\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c6(M)dM is the number of galaxies with absolute magnitude between M and M + dM\nper Mpc3 . Three free parameters are fit using an empirical luminosity function; \u03b1 is the\nslope at the faint end of the luminosity function, M \u2217 is the luminosity where the luminosity\nfunction turns over, and \u03c6\u2217 is the density normalization.\nFor the non-evolving models the local galaxy luminosity function was used at all redshifts. The GALEX NUV galaxy luminosity function of Wyder et al. (2005) was used for\nthe uvw2, uvm2, and uvw1 models. In the u band the models are based on the local U band\nluminosity function from Ilbert et al. (2005). In the evolving models the Schechter function\nparameters \u03b1, \u03c6\u2217 , and M \u2217 vary with redshift. In the uvw2, uvm2, and uvw1 bands the evolution of the Schechter function parameters is based on their evolution at 1500 \u00c5 as found\nby Arnouts et al. (2005), normalized to match the Wyder et al. (2005) NUV parameters for\nthe local universe. For the u band the evolution of the Schechter function parameters comes\nfrom Ilbert et al. (2005). In neither the non-evolving nor evolving models does the dust\nextinction change as a function of redshift, nor does the underlying galaxy template evolve.\nA model with that level of complexity would be beyond the scope of this paper.\nThe model number counts are also corrected for the Lyman forest and continuum using\nthe methods described by Madau (1995). With the exception of Hubble Deep Field U band\nnumber counts (Metcalfe et al. 2001; Volonteri et al. 2000) NUV and U model number\ncounts are generally not corrected for Lyman absorption. Our modeling reveals that this is\njustified. In the bands considered in this paper this affects the models by a few percent at\n29th magnitude and much less at brighter magnitudes. Although the models described here\nare plotted mainly for context the Lyman absorption corrections are included.\nExample models are plotted with the number counts in Figures 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\n5.\n\nResults\n\nFigures 3 and 4 show that in the uvw2 and uvm2 filters the number counts are in\nexcellent agreement with the NUV results from GALEX (Xu et al. 2005) and HST (Gardner\net al. 2000). Furthermore, Figures 3 and 4 demonstrate the unique contribution of UVOT.\nThe UVOT number counts have a significant overlap with GALEX, however they continue\n\u223c 1.5 magnitudes deeper with error bars comparable to those of GALEX. In this magnitude\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nrange they overlap with the HST number counts, but are much less uncertain due to the\nwider field of view of UVOT as compared to STIS. While UVOT is not able to go as deep as\nHST, it provides more precise number counts in the magnitude range where there is a knee\nin the slope of the number counts.\nFigures 3 and 4 also show some of the models discussed in \u00a74. The models shown are for\nthe star forming galaxy template with Calzetti et al. (1994) dust models and AV = 1.0. The\nsolid line is a model with a non-evolving galaxy luminosity function and the dashed line is\nan evolving model following the evolution of the Schechter function parameters described by\nArnouts et al. (2005). The underlying models are the same in the two figures, but have been\ncalculated for the different filters. In both cases the non-evolving luminosity function model\nunder-predicts the number counts given the galaxy template and extinction assumptions.\nHowever the evolving luminosity function model is simultaneously in good agreement with\nthe uvw2 and uvm2 number counts. This is an independent confirmation that the evolution\nin the luminosity function parameters found by Arnouts et al. (2005) are reasonable.\nFigure 5 shows that the uvw1 number counts are significantly higher than the GALEX\nNUV counts. This can be explained by the fact that the uvw1 filter has a tail in the red\nwith significant sensitivity between 3000 and 4000 \u00c5. This extends redward of the limits of\nthe GALEX and STIS NUV filters. At this point bright elliptical galaxies can be detected\nin spite of the fact that they do not produce an appreciable flux in the NUV. Beyond the\nextreme case of ellipticals, post-starburst galaxies with substantial populations of A type\nstars and even to a lesser extent regular spiral galaxies will also be over represented in the\nuvw1 number counts compared to the NUV due to light being detected in the red wing of\nthe uvw1 filter.\nThe black models in Figure 5 are the same as those in Figures 3 and 4. The evolving\nluminosity function model is still better than the no evolution model, and is fairly representative of the GALEX and HST number counts. However it does not agree with the uvw1\nnumber counts as well as in the uvw2 and uvm2. This is due to the fact that the starburst\ngalaxy template is too blue to take into account the red objects which may be detected by\nthe red end of the uvw1 filter. The red models assume the same evolutionary parameters as\nthe black models but uses the redder cosmic spectrum of Baldry et al. (2002) as the galaxy\ntemplate. The models using the cosmic spectrum template are below their respective star\nforming template counterparts. Thus the cosmic spectrum model has the opposite problem\nin that it undercounts galaxies experiencing strong star formation. This shows that the\nsimple modeling used here is less successful for describing the uvw1 number counts, but also\nsuggests that the uvw1 filter could be useful in constraining the relative numbers of different\ngalaxy types over time.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nFigure 6 shows that the u band number counts are generally in good agreement with\nother observations. On the faint end of the number counts the UVOT observations are in\nexcellent agreement with the U band counts of Capak et al. (2004) and Eliche-Moral et al.\n(2006) and the u band counts of Metcalfe et al. (2001). At around magnitude 22 to 23\nthe UVOT number counts appear about 50% higher. One explanation for this is that the\nYasuda et al. (2001) u number counts are also higher than the other observations on the\nfaint end. Modeling galaxy colors shows that the SDSS u is a much better proxy for UVOT\nu than Johnson U. The higher number counts may be due to additional blue sensitivity.\nFigure 6 also reveals that in the u band UVOT does not have the unique advantage it has\nin the NUV filters as it covers the same magnitude range as the ground based observations\nand does not go as deep. However it provides an independent check on the ground based\nresults.\nFigure 6 also shows u band model number counts for both the starburst (black) and\ncosmic spectrum (red) templates, and both non-evolving luminosity functions (solid) and\nthose which evolve with the parameters of Ilbert et al. (2005). In the u band the evolving\nluminosity function models with the starburst and cosmic spectrum templates bracket the\nobserved number counts, but then turn over at u \u223c 25 faster than the observed counts.\nIn summary, the UVOT is uniquely positioned to cover the knee in the galaxy number\ncounts compared to GALEX and HST in the NUV. Due to its smaller PSF it can go deeper\nthan the GALEX confusion limit, and it's larger field of view provides better statistics on\nthe bright end of the STIS number counts. The simple model number counts used here\nstrongly point to an evolving galaxy luminosity function in agreement with earlier studies.\nMore detailed models are needed to explain the number counts in the uvw1 and u filters, but\nare beyond the scope of this paper. However the measurements provided by this paper in the\nmagnitude range where the number counts turn over will enable a more precise differentiation\nbetween models. In addition, the three NUV filters of UVOT are narrower than the single\nNUV filter of STIS and GALEX so more color information is provided which is potentially\nuseful for more involved modeling. Future plans include measurements of the UV galaxy\nluminosity function as a function of redshift.\nWe acknowledge support from NASA Astrophysics Data Analysis grant, #NNX09AC87G.\nThis work is sponsored at PSU by NASA contract NAS5-00136 and at MSSL by funding\nfrom the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC).\nFacilities: Swift (UVOT)\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nREFERENCES\nArnouts, S., et al. 2005, ApJ, 619, L43\nBaldry, I.
