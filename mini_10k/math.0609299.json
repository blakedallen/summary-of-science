We establish the analogue for maps on trees of the result\nestablished in [Bob02, Bob05] for interval maps, that a continuous selfmap for which all but countably many points have at least m preimages\n(and none have less than two) has topological entropy bounded below\nby log m.\n\n1. Introduction\nThis paper continues the investigation in [Bob02, Bob05, BN05] of the relation between the topological entropy htop (f ) of a continuous map f : X \u2192 X\nof a compact space to itself and the number of preimages of points under f .\nWe thank Lluis Alsed\u00e0 for extensive and helpful discussions during the\nwriting of this paper.\nA continuous map f : X \u2192 X is m-fold on a subset Y \u2282 X if every point\nin Y has at least m preimages in X. We drop the reference to the subset Y\nwhen it is the whole space.\nAn argument due to Misiurewicz and Przytycki [MP77] shows that any\nC 1 map on any compact manifold which is m-fold on the set of its regular\n(non-critical) values satisfies the estimate\n(1)\n\nhtop (f ) \u2265 log m.\n\nThis argument is detailed in [BN05]. Ethan Coven [Cov94] conjectured that\nthe differentiability condition could be replaced by continuity for a 2-fold\nmap of the interval; this was established in [Bob02].\nA simple example [BN05] shows that for a continuous map of the interval,\nfailure of the 2-fold condition at a single point can allow entropy zero; the\nsame example can be adapted to create an m-fold map on the circle with zero\nentropy. However, in [Bob05] it was shown that for a map of the interval,\nonce the 2-fold condition is assumed to hold everywhere, the estimate (1) is\nguaranteed with any higher value of m as soon as the m-fold condition holds\non the complement of a countable set. We call a continuous map f : X \u2192 X\nDate: November 18, 2017.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 37E10; Secondary 37B40, 37E05.\nKey words and phrases.

In\n[BN05] it was shown that Equation (1) holds for a cocountably m-fold selfmap of the circle provided there is a positive lower bound on the diameter\nof all preimage sets of points.\nIn this paper, we establish the following extension to trees of the result\nestablished by the second author [Bob05] for maps of the interval:\nTheorem 1.1. Suppose f : T \u2192 T is a cocountably m-fold map of a (finite)\ntree to itself. Then Equation (1) holds:\nhtop (f ) \u2265 log m.\nOur strategy follows that of [Bob02, Bob05], with some modifications\nto adapt it to more general trees. In \u00a7 2 we describe a modification of\n[BN05, Theorem 4.8], which systematizes the strategy of [Bob02, Bob05] as\nan abstract set of conditions on a kind of weak \"horseshoe\" (which we refer to\nas a shift system) that guarantee the estimate (1). This is general symbolic\ndynamics, and is not specific to tree maps. Then in \u00a7 3 we formulate a\nscheme for linearly ordering the points of a tree, which takes the place of\nthe linear ordering on an interval in our arguments. The hypotheses of the\nsymbolic result are established for any m-fold map on a tree in \u00a7\u00a74-5, and\neverything is combined to prove our main result in \u00a7 6.\nWe close this section with an example which shows that the set of points\nwhere the m-fold condition fails in the hypotheses of Theorem 1.1 cannot be\nallowed to be uncountable, even if it is nowhere dense (at least not without\nfurther conditions).\nProposition 1.2. For each integer m > 0 there exists a map f : I \u2192 I of\nthe interval I = [0, 1] to itself such that\n(1) f is globally 2-fold;\n(2) f is m-fold on a set Y = I \\ K, where K is a nowhere dense, closed\n(uncountable) set;\n(3) htop (f ) = log 2.\nProof. We begin with a \"flattened tent map\" g : I \u2192 I, taking both endpoints\nto 0, taking a central interval [a, b] to the right endpoint, and affine (or\neven just strictly monotone) on each of the complementary intervals. For\nexample, taking a = 31 , b = 23 , we can define g by\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nfor 0 \u2264 x \u2264 13\n\uf8f23x\ng(x) := 1\nfor 31 \u2264 x \u2264 23\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n3(1 \u2212 x) for 23 \u2264 x \u2264 1.\n\nClearly, htop (g) = log 2.\n\n\fTOPOLOGICAL ENTROPY OF m-fold MAPS ON TREES\n\n3\n\nNow, the iterated preimages of the central interval (a, b) consist of disjoint\nopen intervals\nk\n\ng\n\n\u2212k\n\n[(a, b)] =\n\n2\n[\n\n(akn , bkn ),\n\nk = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\nn=1\n\nwhose union is a dense open set\n\nY =\n\n\u221e\n[\n\ng\u2212k [(a, b)];\n\nk=0\n\nthe complement of Y is a Cantor-like set K \u2282 I (with a = 31 and b = 23 , K is\nthe classical middle-third Cantor set). We modify g on each of the intervals\n(akn , bkn ), k > 0, to a map f : I \u2192 I mapping (akn , bkn ) and its mirror image,\n(1 \u2212 bkn , 1 \u2212 akn ), onto g((akn , bkn )) in an m-fold manner.\nThen clearly f is m-fold on the set Y , but since f k+1 ((akn , bkn )) = {1},\neach of the intervals (akn , bkn ) is wandering; thus\nhtop (f ) = htop (f |K) = htop (g|K) = log 2.\n\u0003\n2. Entropy via Shift Systems\nThe material of this section is not specific to trees, and closely follows\n[BN05, \u00a7\u00a73-4]. However, a modification of the definition of a \"locally dividing\" set was needed for our purposes here. We shall sketch many of\nthe arguments, referring the reader to the exposition in [BN05] for details,\nbut provide more detailed proofs where the modification mentioned above\nrequires them.\nAn m-shift system for a map f : X \u2192 X is a collection\nH = {H1 , ..., Hm }\nof m nonempty (but not necessarily closed or disjoint) sets Hi \u2282 X satisfying\n(2)\n\nf (Hi ) \u2287 H := H1 \u222a * * * \u222a Hm\n\nfor i = 1, . . . , m.\n\nThe address set of x \u2208 X is\n\u03b1(x) := {a \u2208 {1, . . . , m} | x \u2208 Ha }\nand its cardinality \u03b7(x) is the multiplicity of H at x. The set of points with\npositive multiplicity is precisely H; we define the kernel (resp. center) of\nH to be the set of points with multiplicity greater than one (resp. equal to\nm)\n[\nK(H) := {x | \u03b7(x) > 1} =\nHi \u2229 Hj\nZ(H) := {x | \u03b7(x) = m} =\n\ni6=j\nm\n\\\n\ni=1\n\nHi .\n\n\f4\n\nJOZEF BOBOK AND ZBIGNIEW NITECKI\n\nWe also define the core of H as the set of points whose orbit remains in\nZ(H) for all time:\nZ0 (H) := {x \u2208 X | f k (x) \u2208 Z(H) for all k} =\n\n\u221e\n\\\n\nf \u2212k [Z(H)].\n\nk=0\n\nObviously, Z0 (H) \u2286 Z(H) \u2286 K(H) \u2286 H. We will call the shift system H\nnontrivial if Hi \\ Z0 (H) 6= \u2205 for all i, and closed if each Hi is a closed\nsubset of X.\nA closed m-shift system with empty kernel (K(H) = \u2205) is usually called a\nhorseshoe in the context of maps of the interval [ALM00]; the itinerary of\na point with respect to a horseshoe is the sequence a0 ... of addresses of its\niterates, defined by\nf i (x) \u2208 Hai .\n\n(3)\n\nHowever, when K(H) 6= \u2205, Equation (3) need not define a unique itinerary\nfor a point x \u2208 X. Let \u03a9m (n) denote the set of n-tuples (or \"n-words\")\na0 ...an\u22121 with ai \u2208 {1, ..., m}. For n \u2208 N, the n-itinerary set of x \u2208 X is\nthe subset of \u03a9m (n) defined via Equation (3):\nn\u22121\n\u03a9(x)(n) := {a0 . . . an\u22121 \u2208 \u03a9m (n) | f i (x) \u2208 Hai for i < n} = Xi=0\n\u03b1(f i (x)).\n\nThe set of points for which \u03a9(x)(n) 6= \u2205\nDn :=\n\nn\u22121\n\\\n\nf \u2212i [H]\n\ni=0\n\nis the union of the sets\n(4)\n\n\u03a0(w) := {x \u2208 X | w \u2208 \u03a9(x)(n)} =\n\nn\u22121\n\\\n\nf \u2212i [Hwi ]\n\ni=0\n\nas w = w0 ...wn\u22121 ranges over the finite collection \u03a9m (n) of n-words. The\nintersection\n\u221e\n\u221e\n\\\n\\\nDn\nf \u2212i [H] =\nD :=\ni=0\n\nn=1\n\nis the set of points whose whole forward orbit is contained in H; we refer to\nit as the domain of H.\nFor a horseshoe, the assignment of an itinerary to each point of D is a\ncontinuous map onto the m-shift space \u03a9m and hence provides a semiconjugacy from the D-restriction of f to the one-sided shift map on \u03a9m ; the\nestimate (1) on entropy is an immediate consequence in this case.\nThe continuity of itineraries with respect to a horseshoe has a semicontinuity analogue for a general closed shift system. Recall that for any sequence\nof sets Ai , i = 1, 2, ...\n\u221e\n\u221e [\n\\\nAi .\nlim sup Ai :=\nk=1 i=k\n\n\fTOPOLOGICAL ENTROPY OF m-fold MAPS ON TREES\n\n5\n\nLemma 2.1. Suppose H is a closed m-shift system.\n(1) For each x \u2208 X, \u03a9(x) is a closed subset of \u03a9m .\n(2) For each nonempty (closed) set A \u2282 \u03a9m (n), n \u2208 N (n = \u221e), \u03a0(A)\nis a nonempty closed subset of X.\n(3) For n \u2208 N, if xi \u2208 Dn for i = 1, 2, ..., then lim sup \u03a9(xi )(n) 6= \u2205.\n(4) The set-valued maps x 7\u2192 \u03a9(x)(n), n \u2208 N \u222a {\u221e}, are upper semicontinuous: if xi \u2192 x in X, then lim sup \u03a9(xi )(n) \u2282 \u03a9(x)(n).\nThis is Lemma 3.3 of [BN05]; we refer the reader there for a proof.\nTo obtain entropy estimates from a shift system with nonempty kernel,\nwe need some further assumptions.\nDefinition 2.2. We say a set W \u2282 X locally divides the m-shift system\nH if\n(1) f (W ) \u2282 W\n(2) Hi \\ W 6= \u2205 for i = 1, . . . , m\n(3) There exists a closed shift-invariant set \u039b \u2282 \u03a9m such that\nhtop (\u039b) < log m\nand a neighborhood V of W in X such that if f i (x) \u2208 V \\ W for\ni = 0, . . . , n \u2212 1 then\n\u03a9(x)(n) \u2282 \u039b(n)\nwhere \u039b(n) denotes the set of initial words of length n for sequences\nin \u039b.\nWe note that the third condition above is somewhat different from that\nin the definition of local division in [BN05], but contains it as a special case\nby [BN05, Lemma 4.2].\nRemark 2.3. Let H be a closed m-shift system, and w \u2208 \u03a9m (n) any finite\nword. Then\n(1) \u03a0(w) is a closed nonempty set in X\n(2) If W locally divides H, then \u03a0(w) is not contained in W .\n(1) is an easy consequence of Equation (4), while (2) is a consequence of\nconditions 1 and 2 in Definition 2.2.\n\u2666\nLemma 2.4. If Wj , j = 1, . . . , n are\nS sets that locally divide a closed m-shift\nsystem H, then their union W := nj=1 Wj also locally divides H, provided\nthat Hi \\ W 6= \u2205 for i = 1, . . . , m.\nProof.

It follows by Lemma 2.10 with y any element of M and A = \u0393\nthat we can find U (x) and k(x) so that \u03a9(x\u2032 )(k(x)) \u2229 \u0393(k(x)) = \u2205\nfor all x\u2032 \u2208 U (x).\n(3) If M \u2282 \u03c9(x) \u2229 W , pick \u039b and V associated to W in Definition\n2.2. Since ent(\u039b) < ent(\u0393), \u039b is disjoint from \u0393, and hence \u039b(k0 ) \u2229\n\u0393(k0 ) = \u2205 for some k0 \u2208 N.

Let \u03b2 as in Proposition 2.6. We will show that for\n0 < \u03b5 < log m \u2212 max{ent(\u039b), \u03b2}, f has minimal sets M with\nhtop (M ) \u2265 log m \u2212 \u03b5.\nBy [Gri73], \u03a9m contains shift-minimal sets with entropy arbitrarily near\nlog m, so we can find \u0393\u03b5 minimal with\nent(\u0393\u03b5 ) > log m \u2212 \u03b5 > max{ent(\u039b), \u03b2}.\nIf some M \u2282 H \\ W has htop (M ) < log m \u2212 \u03b5, then by Proposition 2.6\nand Lemma 2.7, ent(\u03a9(M )) < log m \u2212 \u03b5. Thus, if no minimal set M has\nent(\u03a9(M )) \u2265 log m \u2212 \u03b5 , then Proposition 2.11 says that for some k \u2208 N,\n\u03a9(x)(k) \u2229 \u0393\u03b5 (k) = \u2205 whenever f k\u22121 (x) \u2208\n/ W . But Remark 2.3(3) says that\nevery w \u2208 \u0393\u03b5 (k) belongs to some \u03a9(x)(k) for a point with f k\u22121 (x) \u2208\n/ W, a\ncontradiction.\nThis establishes the existence of minimal sets satisfying htop (M ) \u2265 log m\u2212\n\u03b5. Thus htop (f ) \u2265 log m \u2212 \u03b5, and since \u03b5 > 0 can be chosen arbitrarily small,\nthe conclusion follows.\n\u0003\n3. Trees\nTopologically, a (finite) tree is a uniquely arcwise connected Hausdorff\nspace which is a union of (finitely many) closed intervals. The complement\nT \\ {x} of a point x \u2208 T has finitely many components, called the branches\nof T at x; a closed branch at x is the union of {x} with a branch at x.\nThe valence of x is the number of branches at x; a point of valence one\n(resp. valence > 2) is called an endpoint (resp. a branchpoint) of T ; the\nset of all branchpoints of T is denoted B(T ).\nWe endow T with further combinatorial structure, first by distinguishing\na finite set V(T ) of vertices which includes all endpoints and branchpoints\n(and perhaps some valence two points), and then distinguishing one vertex\nv0 as the root of T . An edge of T is the closure of a component of T \\V(T ).\nEach closed branch of T at v \u2208 V(T ) contains a unique edge with endpoint\nv; for v 6= v0 , the incoming branch (resp. incoming edge) at v is the\nbranch containing v0 (resp. the unique edge at v contained in the convex\nhull hv0 , vi), and the other branches at v\u2013as well as edges at v contained\nin their closures\u2013are outgoing at v. We direct each edge of T so that v is\nthe terminal or right (resp. initial or left) endpoint of the incoming (resp.\nany outgoing) edge at v. We use interval notation, denoting the edge with\nleft endpoint u and right endpoint v by [u, v], and adapt the notation of\nopen and half-open intervals to denote edges missing one or both endpoints.\nThe number of outgoing branches (equivalently edges) at v \u2208 V(T ) is its\noutdegree (clearly, for v 6= v0 this is one less than the valence). The level\nof a vertex v \u2208 V(T ) is the number of edges contained in hv0 , vi (so the root\nis at level zero).\nNow, we wish to define a linear ordering \u227a on the points of T . We begin\nby numbering the outgoing edges at each vertex v \u2208 V(T ); this induces a\n\n\f10\n\nJOZEF BOBOK AND ZBIGNIEW NITECKI\n\nnumbering of the outgoing branches, Bi (v), i = 1, . . . , \u03bd, where \u03bd is the\noutdegree of v; for the moment, this numbering is arbitrary, but we will\nimpose a further condition on it in \u00a7 5. For v 6= v0 , the incoming branch is\nnumbered zero, so\nT \\ {v} =\n\n\u03bd\n[\n\nBi (v)\n\ni=0\n\n(for v = v0 , the only difference is that there is no B0 (v0 )).\nGiven this numbering, we assign to each point x 6= v0 an address as follows. There is a unique simple path \u03b3(x) from v0 to x; let V (x) = (v0 , ..., vk )\nbe the sequence of vertices occurring along \u03b3(x)-if x \u2208 V(T ) then vk is\nthe last vertex along \u03b3(x) before x. For each j = 0, . . . , k, there is precisely one outgoing branch at vj , say Bij (vj ), containing x. The sequence\n\u03b1(x) := (i0 , ..., ik ) is the address of x in T . Two points have the same address in T precisely if they belong to the same left-open edge (vk , vk+1 ]. The\nlinear ordering \u227a is then defined by lexicographic comparison of addresses\nand, within an edge, the direction from left to right.

This is based on the idea of regular m-sections from [BN05].\n4.1. Regular values. Suppose f : T \u2192 T is continuous and x \u2208 T with\ny = f (x) \u2208 T \\ V(T ). Then a small neighborhood of y is an interval disjoint\nfrom B(T ), so that it makes sense to talk about points being on one or the\nother side of y. We say that x is a non-minimal (resp. non-maximal)\npreimage of y if there exist points x\u2032 arbitrarily near x with f (x\u2032 ) < y (resp.\nf (x\u2032 ) > y).\n\n\f12\n\nJOZEF BOBOK AND ZBIGNIEW NITECKI\n\nGiven m \u2208 N, we say that y \u2208 T \\ V(T ) is a left m-regular (resp. right\nm-regular) value for f : T \u2192 T if y has at least m non-minimal (resp. nonmaximal) preimages. The set of all left m-regular (resp. right m-regular )\nvalues of f will be denoted Cm (f, l) (resp. Cm (f, r)), and their intersection,\nthe set of m-regular values, will be denoted Cm (f ).\nIn [BN05, \u00a75.1] it is shown that Cm (f ) is an open cocountable set for\nany cocountably m-fold map of the circle; the analogous result in our case,\nf : T \u2192 T , T a (finite) tree, follows from an analogous argument.\nProposition 4.1. For any cocountably m-fold map f : T \u2192 T on a finite\ntree, Cm (f ) is an open cocountable set.\nProof. The argument in [BN05] has four steps; we summarize these and\nindicate any adjustments to make each step work in our setting:\n(1) [BN05, Lemma 5.1] If I and Y = f (I) are closed intervals, then\nevery y \u2208 int Y has at least one non-minimal and at least one nonmaximal preimage in I.\nThis is because the components of I \\ f \u22121 [y] containing the endpoints of I must map onto one-sided neighborhoods of y.\n(2) [BN05, Lemma 5.2] If y is left (resp. right) m-regular, then the\ninterior of some left (resp. right) neighborhood of y is contained in\nCm (f ).\nThis carries over, since we can separate m non-minimal (resp. nonmaximal) preimages of y with neighborhoods disjoint from B(T ).\n(3) [BN05, Lemma 5.3] If f \u22121 [y] has at least m components, then there\nexists a nontrivial interval Y with y an endpoint such that int Y \u2282\nCm (f ).\nThis carries over provided y \u2208\n/ f (V(T )), since we can find 2m\nintervals, each contained in a single edge of T , with one endpoint an\nendpoint of a component of f \u22121 [y], and each mapping onto a onesided neighborhood of y; at least m of these intervals map onto the\nsame side of y, and we can apply the preceding result.\n(4) [BN05, Proposition 5.4] Cm (f ) is open by the second result above,\nand the points y for which f \u22121 [y] has nonempty interior is at most\ncountable. Throwing these out as well as the (finite) set f (V(T )), we\nhave a cocountable set Y \u2282 T for which the third result above says\nthat each y \u2208 Y is either an element of Cm (f ) or an endpoint of a\ncomponent of Cm (f ).

Monotone Sections. Suppose that we have a linear ordering \u227a on T\nas in \u00a7 3. We begin with some remarks on comparability.\nRemark 4.5 (Comparability).\n(1) Suppose x \u227a x\u2032 and x is not a vertex. Then there exist neighborhoods U, U \u2032 of x and x\u2032 which are\ncomparable: that is, z \u227a z \u2032 for all z \u2208 U and z \u2032 \u2208 U \u2032 , and we write\nU \u227a U \u2032.\n(2) An interval disjoint from B(T ) is comparable with any point not\ncontained in it.\nThis is an immediate consequence of Remark 3.2.\n\n\u2666\n\nRemark 4.6. Suppose J is a nontrivial open interval contained in f (hz, z \u2032 i)\nand disjoint from B(T ). Then there exists an open interval J \u2032 \u2282 hz, z \u2032 i with\nf (J \u2032 ) = J.\nTo see this, consider the preimage sets for the two endpoints of J; these are\ndisjoint nonempty closed subsets of the interval hz, z \u2032 i, and it is easy to see\nthat in such a situation some component of the complement of their union\nis an interval with one endpoint in each, and it must map onto J.\n\u2666\nWe say that \u03c8 is a monotone section if \u03c8i (y) \u227a \u03c8i+1 (y) for each i =\n1, . . . , m \u2212 1 and y \u2208 Y .\nRemark 4.7. Suppose f has an m-section \u03c8 defined on a cocountable open\nset Y \u2282 T satisfying Equation (6). Then we can renumber the indices of the\ncomponents by a permutation on each component of Y so that the m-section\nis also monotone.

Then for every\nx\u2032 \u2208 U there exists x\u2032\u2032 \u2208 J with f (x\u2032 ) = f (x\u2032\u2032 ) := y; but since x\u2032\u2032 \u227a x\u2032 we\nhave that x\u2032 6= my ; hence x \u2208\n/ H1 . Similarly, if U \u227a J then x \u2208\n/ Hm .\n\u2666\nLemma 4.9. Suppose x \u2208 H# , together with f (x), is not a branchpoint\nof T . Then each of the two closed intervals into which x divides the edge\ncontaining it is mapped into a single closed branch of T relative to f (x).\nProof. If not, then there exists a closed subinterval J of the edge, disjoint\nfrom x, whose image contains f (x) in its interior. Then picking a neighborhood U of x so small that f (U ) \u2282 f (J), we obtain a contradiction to\nRemark 4.8(1).\n\u0003\nGiven the linear ordering on T , we call an m-section on Y \u2282 T spanning\nif for every y \u2208 Y\n\u03c81 (y) = my\n\u03c8m (y) = My .\nProposition 4.10. If f : T \u2192 T is cocountably m-fold, and \u227a is a linear\nordering on T as in \u00a7 3, then there exists a monotone spanning m-section \u03c8\ndefined on a cocountable open set Y \u2282 T for which the corresponding m-shift\nsystem H defined by\nHj := clos {\u03c8j (y) | y \u2208 Y },\n\nj = 1, . . . , m\n\nsatisfies\nf (K(H)) \u2229 Y = \u2205,\n\n\f16\n\nJOZEF BOBOK AND ZBIGNIEW NITECKI\n\nand in particular K(H) is eventually countable.\nProof. From Proposition 4.2 and Remark 4.4, we can find a monotone msection on a cocountable open set Y \u2282 T satisfying Equation (6); using\nRemark 4.7, we can also insure that Y has no vertices or images of vertices,\nand that any point in K(H) has image outside Y . Now, if we replace \u03c81 (y)\n(resp. \u03c8m (y)) with my (resp. My ), we don't change monotonicity, and we\ngain spanning. We need to show that\nH\u2212 \u2229 Hj \u2229 f \u22121 [Y ] = \u2205 for j > 1\nH+ \u2229 Hj \u2229 f \u22121 [Y ] = \u2205 for j < m\nH# \u2229 f \u22121 [Y ] = \u2205.\nSuppose u belongs to one of the sets above, and let U (resp. \u0168 ) be a\nneighborhood of u (resp. y = f (u)) with f (U ) \u2282 \u0168 , with \u0168 contained in\na single component \u0232 of Y , and the length of U sufficiently small that any\nsequence \u03c8j (yi ) contained in U has j constant. This means that there is an\nindex j \u2032 such that \u03c8j \u2032 (y \u2032 ) separates \u03c8j (y \u2032 ) from my\u2032 (resp. My\u2032 ) for every\ny \u2032 \u2208 U , and in particular u cannot be a limit of points of the form myi (resp.\n\u0003\nMyi ).\n5. The Center\nIn this section we concentrate on the second hypothesis of Theorem 1.1:\nthe existence of a set containing all minimal sets in the core which locally\ndivides the shift system H. Given f : T \u2192 T a cocountably m-fold map on\nthe tree T , Proposition 4.10 has given us a monotone spanning m-section\n\u03c8 for which the kernel is eventually countable. Note that this implies in\nparticular that every minimal set in the core is a periodic orbit, since infinite\nminimal sets are uncountable, while the core is contained in every image of\nthe kernel. Thus we are interested in the behavior of orbit segments near a\nperiodic orbit in the core.\nWe begin by noting some simplifying assumptions concerning f that we\ncan make without loss of generality. Note that any closed connected subset\nT \u2032 \u2282 T is itself a tree. A subtree is natural if it is a union of edges of T ; it\nis proper if it is neither all of T nor a single point.\nWe shall concentrate on maps f : T \u2192 T satisfying\nAssumption 5.1.\n(1) If a branchpoint y of T is f -preperiodic, then\nf (y) is a fixed point of f :\n\u221e\n[\n\nf \u2212n [P er(f )] \u2229 B(T ) \u2282 f \u22121 [F ix(f )] \u2229 B(T ).\n\nn=0\n\n(2) There is no proper f -invariant natural subtree of T .\nRemark 5.2. It suffices to prove Theorem 1.1 for the class of maps satisfying Assumption 5.1.\n\n\fTOPOLOGICAL ENTROPY OF m-fold MAPS ON TREES\n\n17\n\nTo see that we can assume (1), note that since B(T ) is a finite set, the\nrequired property holds for some iterate f n of f . But if f is cocountably\nm-fold then f n is cocountably (mn )-fold, and htop (f n ) = nhtop (f ), so the\nestimates htop (f n ) \u2265 log mn and htop (f ) \u2265 log m are equivalent.\nTo see that we can assume (2), suppose that T \u2032 is an f -invariant proper\nnatural subtree. We distinguish two subcases:\n\u2022 If the restriction f |T \u2032 is cocountably m-fold, then we replace f : T \u2192 T\nwith f : T \u2032 \u2192 T \u2032 using the fact that htop (f |T \u2032 ) \u2264 htop (f ) to complete\nthe argument.\n\u2022 If f |T \u2032 is not cocountably m-fold, we collapse T \u2032 to a point; it is easy\nto see that the quotient space is a tree and the induced action of f on\nthis tree is again cocountably m-fold. Since entropy is nonincreasing\nunder factors, we are done.\n\u2666\nWe will assume from now on that f has both properties above.\nSuppose y \u2208 B(T ) \u2229 F ix(f ). By a branch germ at y we mean the\nintersection of a branch at y with some (sufficiently small) neighborhood of\ny in T . We call a branch (or edge) at y monotone at y if some branch\ngerm maps into a single closed branch at y. A nonmonotone branch (or\nedge) at y is one for which there are points arbitrarily near y whose images\nbelong to distinct branches at y.\nWe shall call the numbering of left-open edges of T (and hence the induced\nordering \u227a on the points of T ) f -adjusted if for every y \u2208 B(T ) \u2229 F ix(f )\nevery monotone outgoing edge at y is numbered lower than every nonmonotone outgoing edge at y. (We cannot a priori rule out the possibility that\nthe incoming branch is nonmonotone at y; this must be handled separately.)\nWe can always pick our numbering to be f -adjusted, and we assume from\nnow on that this property holds.\n5.1. Periodic Branchpoints in the Core. In this subsection we show\nthat any periodic branchpoint in the core locally divides H.\nGiven y \u2208 B(T ) \u2229 F ix(f ) of outdegree \u03bd, and assuming the ordering \u227a is\nf -adjusted, we have numbered the branches at y as\n\u03bd\n[\nBi (y)\nT \\ {y} =\ni=0\n\nconsistent with \u227a: that is, Bi1 (y) \u227a Bi2 (y) for 0 < i1 < i2 . For a neighborhood U of y in T , we use the notation\nUi := Bi (y) \u2229 U.\n(Remember that Bi (y) does not include y.) Set G := {H1 , Hm } and H\u2217 :=\nH1 \u222a Hm . For i = 0, . . . , \u03bd and j = 1, m, or \u2217, let\nGji := Ui \u2229 Hj .\nRemark 5.3. If f (Ui ) = {y} then Ui \u2229 H\u2217 = \u2205.\n\n\f18\n\nJOZEF BOBOK AND ZBIGNIEW NITECKI\n\nWe will successively shrink the neighborhood U to insure a number of\nconditions as the section progresses; thus we are concerned with the germ\nof the behavior at y. In what follows, the ith branch at y will be denoted\nsimply as Bi .\nRemark 5.4. Suppose V is a closed subinterval of a branch at y such that\nf (V ) ) {y}. Then for a sufficiently small neighborhood U of y (in particular,\none disjoint from V ),\n(1) There exists at least one branch germ Ui such that f (V ) \u2283 Ui .\n(2) If V \u2282 Bi0 , where i0 > 0 (i.e., V is contained in an outgoing branch)\nand z \u2208 Ui \u2282 f (V ), then for any i\u2032 , the branch germ Ui\u2032 does not\ncontain mz (resp. Mz ) if i\u2032 > i0 (resp. i\u2032 < i0 ).\n(3) If V \u2282 {x | x \u227a y} and z \u2208 Ui \u2282 f (V ), then for any i\u2032 \u2265 0, the\nbranch germ Ui\u2032 does not contain mz .\nThis is because if U is disjoint from V , and then z has a preimage in V ,\nwhich is \u227a (resp. \u227b) any point of Ui\u2032 for i\u2032 6= i0 . If i\u2032 = i0 , V is farther from\ny than Ui\u2032 , which implies that V \u227a Ui\u2032 (resp. V \u227b Ui\u2032 ) when i0 = 0 (resp.\ni0 > 0).\n\u2666\nLemma 5.5. If Bi is not monotone at y, then for U sufficiently small,\n(1) if i = 0, G1i = \u2205;\n(2) if 1 \u2264 i \u2264 \u03bd, Gm\ni = \u2205.\nProof. By Remark 5.3, we can assume that Ui is not collapsed to y by f . By\nassumption, there exist points xk \u2208 Bi converging to y with f (xk ) = y. For\neach branch Bi\u2032 intersecting f (Bi ), we can find a closed interval Vi\u2032 \u2282 Bi\nsuch that f (Vi\u2032 ) contains a neighborhood of y in {y} \u222a Bi\u2032 . A finite number\nof these suffice to fill a neighborhood of y in f (Bi ). Now the result follows\nfrom Remark 5.4.\n\u0003\nSet\n\u03a6 := {i | Ui \u2229 H\u2217 6= \u2205 for all neighborhoods U of y};\nwe call branches Bi with i \u2208 \u03a6 active branches (and the corresponding\nneigborhoods Ui as active branch germs). We will often refer to an active\nbranch germ Ui via just its index i. We say j \u2208 {1, m} is a color for the\nactive branch germ Ui (or, by abuse of language, for i) if Gji 6= \u2205. Note that\na given branch may have up to two colors. A branch germ is monochrome\nif it has precisely one color.\nRemark 5.6. Active nonmonotone branch germs are monochrome, with\n(\nj = m if i = 0 ,\nj = 1 otherwise.\nThis is an immediate corollary of Lemma 5.5.\n\n\u2666\n\n\fTOPOLOGICAL ENTROPY OF m-fold MAPS ON TREES\n\n19\n\nOne can find a neighborhood U of y so that whenever \u0168 \u2282 U is a subneighborhood of y, the colors of Ui and \u0168i agree for i = 0, . . . , \u03bd; we call any\nsuch U a determining neighborhood of y. We will write\n(i, j) \u2192 (i\u2032 , j \u2032 )\n\n(12)\n\nif for some (hence any) determining neighborhood,\n\u2032\n\nf (Gji ) \u2229 Gji\u2032 6= \u2205.\nWe form a branch graph B whose vertices are the active branch germs,\nB\nand with a directed edge from Ui to Ui\u2032 (denoted i \u2192 i\u2032 ) if there exist\nj, j \u2032 \u2208 {1, m} such that (i, j) \u2192 (i\u2032 , j \u2032 ) (in the sense of Equation (12)).\nLemma 5.7.\n(1) Every vertex in B has indegree at most 2.\n(2) Every monotone vertex in B has outdegree at most 1.\nB\n\nB\n\n(3) If i1 \u2192 i\u2032 and i2 \u2192 i\u2032 with i1 and i2 distinct, then i1 and i2 are both\nmonotone and monochrome, with different colors.\nB\n\nProof. To see (1), suppose that ik \u2192 i\u2032 for three distinct ik , k = 1, 2, 3.\nWe can assume that in an f -adjusted ordering Bi1 \u227a Bi2 \u227a Bi3 . Then by\nm\n1\n1\nRemark 5.4, Gm\ni1 = Gi2 = \u2205 and Gi2 = Gi3 = \u2205; in particular, Bi2 is not\nactive, a contradiction.\n(2) is clear, by the definition of monotonicity.\nTo see (3), suppose i1 < i2 , so that by Remark 5.4 Mz 6\u2208 Ui1 and mz 6\u2208\nUi2 for any z \u2208 Ui\u2032 . Thus we must have G1i1 and Gm\ni2 both nonempty;\nby Lemma 5.5 this means that to be active Bi2 must be monotone, and\nhence (since the ordering is f -adjusted) either Bi1 is monotone or Bi1 =0 is\nnonmonotone. In this last case, G1i1 = \u2205 by Lemma 5.5 again, contradicting\nthe assumption that Bi1 is active.\n\u0003\nWe call a path or loop in B monotone if every vertex occurring along\nthe path is monotone at y.\nLemma 5.8. Any monotone loop in B contains at least one monochrome\nvertex.\nProof. If the loop contains all the active branch germs at y, then since f is\ncocountably m-fold, some branch contains a nontrivial preimage of y, and\nby Remark 5.4, this implies some branch Bi has G1i or Gm\ni empty.\nIf some branch is not an element of our loop, then since the union of the\n(closed) branches in the loop is a proper natural subtree, it is not invariant\n(by our basic assumption). So at least one of these branches must map to a\nunion of two or more branches (one in the loop, the other out of the loop)\nand again by Remark 5.4 the loop contains a monochrome branch germ. \u0003\nLemma 5.9. Every monotone path \u03b3 in B can be written as a concatenation\n\u03b3 = \u03b1\u03bbk\n\n\f20\n\nJOZEF BOBOK AND ZBIGNIEW NITECKI\n\nwhere \u03bb is a loop and \u03b1 is a path with no repetitions (in particular, |\u03b1| <\ncard \u03a6).\nProof. This is an almost immediate consequence of the fact that every active\nmonotone branch germ has outdegree 1 in B (Lemma 5.7).\n\u0003\nLet U be a determining neighborhood of y. We refer to a point x such\nthat f k (x) \u2208 [U \u2229 H\u2217 ] \\ {y} for k = 0, . . . , n \u2212 1 as a satellite of y with time\nof flight n. Such a point has two kinds of itinerary: a branch itinerary\nn\u22121\nn\u22121\n{ik }k=0\ndefined by f k (x) \u2208 Uik , and a color itinerary {jk }k=0\nsatisfying\nk\nf (x) \u2208 Hjk , k = 0, . . . , n \u2212 1. The branch itinerary is unique, but a priori\na satellite may have more than one color itinerary. However, Lemma 5.5,\nRemark 5.6 and Lemma 5.7 give limitations on the color itineraries which\ncan occur in conjunction with a given branch itinerary. We shall call a choice\nof color itinerary legitimate for a given branch itinerary if it is consistent\nwith these limitations.\nForbidden Color Words: We wish to find a finite color word which does\nnot appear in any color itinerary of any satellite of y. This means that {y}\nlocally divides H (Definition 2.2). We will do this in Corollary 5.14, but\nfirst we need a substantial digression. A colored path of length n in B is a\npath of length n together with a legitimate choice of color for each branch\ngerm Uik :\n\u03b3 = (i0 , j0 ), . . . , (in\u22121 , jn\u22121 ),\n\nik \u2208 \u03a6, jk \u2208 {1, m} for k = 0, . . . , n \u2212 1.\n\nThe branch itinerary, together with a choice of color itinerary, for any satellite of y with time of flight (at least) n, determines a colored path in B of\nlength n, so the number of color itineraries of length n which occur among\nthe satellites of y is bounded above by the number Nn of color itineraries\noccurring among the colored paths of length n in B. Since the number of\n(abstract) color words of length n is 2n , it will suffice to prove\nProposition 5.10. For n sufficiently large,\nNn < 2n .\nGiven a colored path \u03b3 = (i0 , j0 )...(in\u22121 , jn\u22121 ), we have a color word\nc(\u03b3) := j0 ...jn\u22121\nconsisting of the sequence of colors appearing along \u03b3. We can think of c\nas a projection map from colored paths to color words. To estimate Nn , we\nconstruct, for each (legitimate) colored vertex (b, c) \u2208 \u03a6 \u00d7 {1, m}, a rooted\ntree \u0393(b, c) whose vertices \u03b3 \u2208 (b, c)n at level n = 0, 1, ... are the colored\npaths\n\u03b3 = (i0 , j0 )...[(in , jn ) = (b, c)]\nof length n + 1 which end at (b, c), and an edge connecting each vertex \u03b3 =\n(i0 , j0 )...(in , jn ) at level n > 0 with the colored path \u03b3 \u2032 = (i1 , j1 )...(in , jn ) \u2208\n(b, c)n\u22121 at level n \u2212 1 obtained by truncating the first colored vertex. The\nstandard orientation of this edge is from \u03b3 \u2032 to \u03b3 (that is, in the direction\n\n\fTOPOLOGICAL ENTROPY OF m-fold MAPS ON TREES\n\n21\n\nof increasing level), which may at first appear counter-intuitive. We shall,\nhowever, make use of this orientation only briefly (cf. the paragraph preceding Lemma 5.12) . Denote the number of color words (of length n) occuring\nfor vertices at level n \u2212 1 of \u0393(b, c) by\nCn(b, c) := card c((b, c)n\u22121 ).\nP\n\nClearly, Nn \u2264 (b,c)\u2208\u03a6\u00d7{1,m} Cn (b, c).

For each vertex \u03b3 = (i0 , j0 ) . . . (b, c) in (b, c)n\n(1) If n > 0 there is precisely one vertex \u03b3 \u2032 = (i1 , j1 )...(b, c) \u2208 (b, c)n\u22121\nat level n \u2212 1 joined to \u03b3.\n(2) In general, there are at most two vertices \u03b3\u2212 = (i\u22121 , j\u22121 )(i0 , j0 )...(b, c)\nat level n + 1 joined to \u03b3.\n(3) If Ui0 is non-monotone, then no vertex in (b, c)n other than \u03b3 is\njoined to \u03b3 \u2032 .\nProof. (1) is trivial.\nB\n\nTo see (2) and (3), note that if \u03b3\u2212 = (i\u22121 , j\u22121 )(i0 , j0 )...(b, c) then i\u22121 \u2192 i0 .\nFrom Lemma 5.7(1), there are at most two possibilities for i\u22121 , given i0 ;\n(1)\n(2)\nif two distinct possibilities i\u22121 , i\u22121 exist, then both are monotone, with\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nj\u22121 6= j\u22121 ; otherwise, i\u22121 is unique, and can be colored in at most two\nways. By Remark 5.6, a nonmonotone germ can be colored in at most one\nway.\n\u0003\nTo establish Equation (13), we will distinguish colored paths according\nto the branch paths they represent. For p = 0, ..., let Mp(b, c) denote the\nnumber of color words coming from colored paths of length pl + 1 in which\nthe branch path is monotone, and Sp(b, c) the number coming from colored\npaths of length pl+1 going through at least one non-monotone branch germ.\n(The reason for this peculiar numbering will become clearer in what follows.)\nLet us first estimate Mp (b, c). Note that M0 (b, c) = 1, and if p > 0, then\nfor Mp (b, c) to be nonzero we need b to belong to a monotone loop \u03bb in\nB. We denote the length of \u03bb by len(\u03bb); to obtain an estimate on Mp (b, c)\nindependent of b, we let q denote the maximum length of all monotone loops\nin B (note that these are disjoint, by Lemma 5.7(2), and hence there are\nfinitely many); note that\nq \u2264 l.\nGiven a monotone loop \u03bb containing b, Lemma 5.8 implies that \u03bb must contain at least one monochrome vertex, and hence there are at most 2len(\u03bb)\u22121\n\n\f22\n\nJOZEF BOBOK AND ZBIGNIEW NITECKI\n\nlegitimate colorings of \u03bb, and at most\nlen(\u03bbk )(1\u2212\n\n(2len(\u03bb)\u22121 )k = 2\n\nk\n)\nlen(\u03bbk )\n\nlen(\u03bbk )(1\u2212 1q )\n\n\u22642\n\nlegitimate colorings of \u03bbk , the concatenation of \u03bb with itself k times. By\nLemma 5.9, every monotone path ending at b is a concatenation of the form\n\u03b3 = \u03b1\u03bbk for some k, where \u03b1 is a nonrepetitive monotone path, whose\nlength is therefore bounded by the number of monotone vertices, hence by\nl. There is a unique path of length pl + 1 which is a subpath of some power\npl\n\n1\n\nof \u03bb, and the number of colorings of it is bounded by 2pl\u2212\u230a q \u230b \u2264 2pl(1\u2212 q )+1 ;\nthere is also the possibility of replacing the initial subword of this with a\nnonrepetitive monotone path (i.e., \u03b1); the number of legitimate colorings\nof \u03b1 is bounded above by 2l . Thus we have the estimate\npl(1\u2212 1q )+1\n\nMp (b, c) \u2264 2\nfactoring out\n(14)\n\n2pl\n\n(p\u22121)l(1\u2212 1q )+1\n\n+ 2l 2\n\n;\n\nand using the fact that q \u2264 l, we obtain the estimate\n\nMp (b, c) \u2264 2pl [2\u2212p + 2\u2212(p\u22121) ] * 2 = 2p(l\u22121) * 6.\n\nNow consider Sp (b, c). To estimate this we need an excursion into abstract graph theory. By construction, the graph \u0393(b, c) is an (infinite) tree;\nLemma 5.11 ((1) and (2)) tells us that (if we adopt the convention that\nedges are oriented in the direction of increasing level) every vertex except\nthe root has indegree 1 and every vertex has outdegree at most 2. We refer\nto such a graph as a stump and to a vertex with outdegree 0 (resp. 1) as\nan end (resp. cutpoint) of the graph. Each end has a unique path to the\nroot; we call it a cut end if it is not the root, and this path contains at\nleast one cutpoint.\nLemma 5.12. In any stump, the number of cut ends at level l is bounded\nabove by 2l\u22121 .\nProof. First, assign to each edge in the tree a 0 or 1; if the edge is leaving\na cutpoint, make sure it is assigned a 0 (the assignment to edges leaving\na vertex with outdegree 2 can be chosen in an arbitrary way). Then each\nvertex at level l is assigned a sequence of 0's and 1's corresponding to the\nunique path from it to the root. If v is a cut end at level l, consider the\nsequence obtained from its path by replacing the first 0 associated to a cut\npoint with a 1; this leads to a sequence which does not occur in the graph,\nand is a one-to-one map from cut ends into the set of \"missing\" ends. Since\nthere are 2l sequences all together and the set of \"missing\" sequences is\ndisjoint from the set of extant ones, we have that the number of cut ends\nat level l plus the number of \"missing\" image sequences adds to at most 2l ;\nbut the number of image sequences equals the number of cut ends, and we\nare done.\n\u0003\nCorollary 5.13.

Since a colored path contains at least one nonmonotone vertex, we see\nthat some positive level must contain a nonmonotone vertex, and it follows\nfrom Lemma 5.11(3) that a nonmonotone vertex at level k in \u0393(b, c) means\nthat the corresponding vertex at level k \u2212 1 is a cut point. In particular,\nthe number of nonmonotone colored paths of length l + 1 ending at a given\nvertex is at most 2l\u22121 , and this is a bound on S1 (b, c).\n\u0003\nProof of Equation (13):\nIf b is not part of a monotone loop (in particular, if b itself is not monotone), then Mp (b, c) = 0 and every path ending at (b, c) hits a nonmonotone\nvertex at least once in every l steps; the number of legitimate colorings for\nall such paths is bounded above by a product of terms of the form S1 (bi , ci ),\nwhere the subscripted vertices are the ones occurring at precise multiples of\nl steps; each of these is bounded by 2l\u22121 , by Corollary 5.13. In this case,\nCpl+1 (b, c) \u2264 Sp (b, c) \u2264 2p(l\u22121) \u2264 2p(l\u22121) (1 + 6p).\nWhen b is part of a monotone loop, we can still imagine paths ending at\n(b, c) of the type analyzed above, but of course there are others. For any\ngiven path we let k be the maximum integer for which the last kl+1 vertices\nare monotone; then this path consists of a path of length (p \u2212 k)l + 1 of the\ntype above fused with a monotone path of length kl + 1. (The case above\nis k = 0.) The first part(s) can be colored in at most 2(p\u2212k)(l\u22121) ways, as\nabove, while the last part(s) can be colored in at most Mk (b, c) different\nways. Using Equation (14) with k in place of p, we obtain Equation (13)\nCpl+1 (b, c) \u2264\n\np\nX\n\n2(p\u2212k)(l\u22121) Mk (b, c)\n\nk=0\n\n\u2264 2p(l\u22121) +\n\np\nX\n\n2(p\u2212k)(l\u22121) * 6 * 2k(l\u22121)\n\nk=1\np\nX\n\n= 2p(l\u22121) [1 +\n\n6]\n\nk=1\n\n= 2p(l\u22121) [1 + 6p]\nas required.\n\n\u0003\n\nProof of Proposition 5.10:\nThe number of colored vertices (b, c) \u2208 \u03a6 \u00d7 {1, m} is bounded by 2l, so\nsubstituting in Equation (13) we have\nX\nNpl+1 \u2264\nCpl+1 (b, c) \u2264 2l * 2p(l\u22121) [1 + 6p].\n(b,c)\u2208\u03a6\u00d7{1,m}\n\nSince 1 + 6p grows more slowly than 2p , we can find a sufficiently large value\nof p so that l * [1 + 6p] < 2p ; then for n equal to this value of pl + 1 we have\nNn \u2264 2l * 2p(l\u22121) [1 + 6p] < 2 * 2p(l\u22121) 2p = 2pl+1 = 2n\n\n\f24\n\nJOZEF BOBOK AND ZBIGNIEW NITECKI\n\nas required.\n\n\u0003\n\nWe are now in a position to produce a forbidden color word.\nCorollary 5.14. There exists a word in the letters {1, m} which does not\nappear in any color itinerary for any satellite of y.\nProof. Proposition 5.10 shows that the number of words of sufficiently long\nlength which appear in legitimate colorings of paths in \u0393(b, c) (which bounds\nthe number of words appearing in color itineraries of satellites of y) is strictly\nless than the number of abstract words in {1, m}.\n\u0003\n5.2. Periodic Non-branchpoints in the Core. In the previous subsection, we showed that any periodic branchpoint in the core locally divides\nH. We now proceed to the more difficult task of finding a set containing all\nperiodic points in the core but away from B(T ) which locally divides H.\nDefinition 5.15. We denote the set of periodic non-branchpoints in the\ncore by\nP := [Z0 (H) \u2229 P er(f )] \\ B(T ).\nProposition 5.16. P is closed.\nProof. We begin with a few observations:\nClaim: A periodic point which is an accumulation point of\nP has an orbit disjoint from B(T ).\nThis is an immediate corollary of Corollary 5.14: since Z0 (H) is closed,\nthe orbit belongs to Z0 (H); but then if it intersects B(T ), by our assumptions\non f it consists of a fixedpoint in B(T ), and since it is an accumulation point\nof P, there exist periodic points in Z0 (H) arbitrarily near to (but distinct\nfrom) the point; they are satellites of the fixedpoint with arbitrarily long\ntime of flight, and since they belong to Z(H), they have all possible words\nin their itinerary, contrary to Corollary 5.14. \u2666\nNow, suppose {qn } is a sequence of points of P converging to y 6\u2208 P;\ndenote by Qn the orbit of qn .\nSince y \u2208 clos P \u2282 Z0 (H), its \u03c9-limit set must also belong to the invariant closed set Z0 (H), and since the latter is contained in the countable set\nf i (K(H)), any minimal subset is a periodic orbit. Thus we can pick a cycle\nP = {p0 , ..., pN \u22121 } in \u03c9(y), which a fortiori also belongs to P. We can pick\na neighborhood U of P which is disjoint from B(T ) (by the claim) and from\nsome neighborhood of y; going to a subsequence if necessary, we can also\npick points qn\u2032 \u2208 Qn converging to p0 from one side.\nNow pick a closed one-sided neighborhood J0 \u2282 U of p0 containing qn\u2032\nfor all sufficiently large n. We know from Lemma 4.9 and the fact that\nthe qn\u2032 are periodic points whose (forward) orbit leaves U that J1 := f (J0 )\nis again a closed one-sided neighborhood of p1 ; iterating this procedure\n(reducing J0 if necessary) we obtain closed one-sided neighborhoods Ji :=\nf i (J0 ) \u2282 U of pi , i = 0, . . . , N \u2212 1.

We know that some neighborhood\nU \u2032 of q is comparable to J \u0303i . But since f (J \u0303i ) contains J \u0303i+1 , it also contains\nthe image of a neighborhood of q, and this contradicts the assumption that\nq = qn\u2032\u2032 \u2208 H# , by Remark 4.8(1), since J \u0303i \u2282 U contains no branchpoints and\nq \u2208 P.\n\u0003\nLemma 5.17. Suppose pi , i = 1, 2, 3 are distinct elements of P contained\nin a single edge, with p2 between p1 and p3 . If f (p1 ) and f (p3 ) lie in the\nsame edge, then f (p2 ) lies between them; in particular, it belongs to the same\nedge.\nProof. Since they are distinct periodic points, their images under f are also\ndistinct; Lemma 4.9 applied to p1 (resp. p3 ) implies f (p1 ) (resp. f (p3 ))\ncannot separate f (p2 ) from f (p3 ) (resp. f (p1 )), and if f (p1 ) and f (p3 ) lie in\nthe same edge, this implies f (p2 ) lies between them on this edge.\n\u0003\nDefinition 5.18. The edge itinerary of a point p \u2208 P of least period N\nis the sequence ei(p) = {E0 , ..., EN \u22121 } of edges of T visited by p during one\nperiod: f i (p) \u2208 Ei , i = 0, . . . , N \u2212 1.\nA t-fold repetition of {E0 , ..., EN \u22121 } (t \u2208 N) is a sequence of edges\n\u2032\n\u2032\n{E0\u2032 , ..., EtN\n\u22121 } with Ei = Ej whenever i \u2261 j mod N ; in particular, it is a\ndoubling if t = 2. An edge itinerary is repetitive if it is a t-fold repetition\nof some shorter sequence of edges.\nWe call two points p, q \u2208 P edge equivalent (and write p \u223c q) if one\nof their edge itineraries is a t-fold repetition of the other for some t \u2208 N.\nDenote the edge equivalence class of p \u2208 P by [p], and its convex hull in T\nby hpi.\nProposition 5.19.\n(1) If p \u2208 P and t > 2 then ei(p) cannot be a t-fold\nrepetition of any sequence of edges. Thus at most two itineraries can\noccur among the elements of one edge equivalence class, and in this\ncase one is a doubling of the other.\n(2) If p \u223c q with ei(q) doubling ei(p), then p lies between q and f N (q) \u223c\nq, where N is the period of p.\n(3) For any p \u2208 P,\n(a) hpi is a closed (possibly degenerate) interval interior to a single\nedge;\n\n\f26\n\nJOZEF BOBOK AND ZBIGNIEW NITECKI\n\n(b) hpi and hqi are disjoint unless p \u223c q;\n(c) f (hpi) = hf (p)i.\n(1) If for some p \u2208 P the itinerary ei(p) is a t-fold repetition of\nan itinerary of length k, then its period N = kt and the orbit of p\nunder f k consists of t points, all belonging to P and having the same\nedge itinerary, which are permuted by f k . Inductive application of\nLemma 5.17 shows that the extreme points of this set are preserved\nby f k , which means that if t \u2265 3, no internal point of this set can map\nto an extreme point of its image under any iterate of f , contradicting\nthe assumption that they form a periodic orbit under f .\n(2) Suppose p \u223c q and the period of q is greater than that of p; denote\nthe period of p by N . By the preceding item, ei(q) is a doubling of\nei(p), so S := {p, q, f N (q)} is contained in one edge, for each i, f i (S)\nis contained in a single edge, and f N (S) = S. By Lemma 5.17, the\nmiddle point of S cannot map to either extreme point of S, which\nforces p to be the middle point of S.\n(3) (a) This is a trivial consequence of (1) and Proposition 5.16.\n(b) We need to show that if p \u2208 P belongs to hqi then p \u223c q.\nSuppose p \u2208 hqi but p 6\u223c q. Then there exists q \u2032\u2032 \u223c q so that p\nlies between q and q \u2032\u2032 , and by Lemma 5.17 the same holds for\nthe images of these three points by any iterate f i . But then\nLemma 5.17 forces q to have the same edge itinerary as p, or\nelse to be a doubling of it.\n(c) We need to show that a point x \u2208 hpi (not assuming x \u2208 P)\nhas f (x) \u2208 hf (p)i. This follows from application of Lemma 4.9\nto the endpoints of hpi, together with the observation that hpi\ncontains no branchpoints, by the earlier arguments in this proof.\n\u0003\n\nProof.\n\nLemma 5.20. P has finitely many edge-equivalence classes.\nProof. Suppose pn \u2208 P, n = 1, 2, ... belong to pairwise non-edge-equivalent\norbits, with respective periods Nn . Passing to a subsequence, we can assume\nthe pn converge inside a single edge E0 to a point p which by Proposition 5.16\nbelongs to P and hence is periodic, say with period N . For each n, let\ntn := min{t > 0 | f Nn \u2212t (pn ), f N \u2212t (p) belong to different edges}.\nWe can assume by passing to a subsequence that all the tn are congruent\nmodulo N , and all the f Nn \u2212tn (pn ) belong to the same edge. By applying an\niterate of f to the whole picture, we can assume that tn = 1 for all n: thus\nwe have a sequence qn := f Nn\u22121 (pn ) all contained in an edge different from\nthat containing p\u2032 := f N \u22121 (p).\nLet q be an accumulation point of the qn ; by Proposition 5.16 q \u2208 P is\nperiodic, and distinct from p\u2032 ; but both are periodic, and both map to p, a\ncontradiction.\n\u0003\n\n\fTOPOLOGICAL ENTROPY OF m-fold MAPS ON TREES\n\n27\n\nFor any p \u2208 P, the union\nZ(p) :=\n\n[\n\nf i (hpi)\n\nconsists of N disjoint closed (possibly degenerate) intervals\nZ(p) =\n\nN[\n\u22121\n\nZj (p)\n\nj=0\n\nwhere N is the least period among the points in the edge equivalence class\n[p] and the numbering is via the action of f :\nf (Zj (p)) = Zj+1 (p)\n(indices taken mod N ).\nRemark 5.21.

The restriction of f to each set Z(p), p \u2208 P, fails to be\ncocountably m-fold.\nIf Z(p) is not connected (N \u2265 2), at least one component of the complement T \\Z(p) has common boundary points with at least two of the intervals\nZj (p). We call the closure of such a component a central component relative to Z(p), and denote the union of all the central components by C(p).\nA peripheral component of T \\ Z(p) is one attached to a unique interval\nZj (p); we label its closure Pj (p) and denote the union of these by P (p).\nThis yields a partition of the tree corresponding to any edge equivalence\nclass [p]\nT = C(p) \u222a Z(p) \u222a P (p).\nEach interval Zj (p) of Z(p) touches C(p) in at least one endpoint; we will\nwrite\nZj (p) = [zj\u2212 , zj+ ]\nwhere zj\u2212 is a common boundary point of Zj (p) and C(p); if Zj (p) is nondegenerate, then the other endpoint zj+ may touch another central component,\nor the peripheral component Pj (p), or be an end of T , in which case we shall\nrefer to a \"trivial peripheral component\" Pj (p) = \u2205. When Zj (p) is a single\npoint, we shall nonetheless refer separately to its endpoints zj\u2212 and zj+ .\nIf N = 1, i.e., Z(p) = Z0 (p) = [z0\u2212 , z0+ ], then T \\ Z(p) has at most two\ncomponents, both peripheral; we shall associate to each endpoint a (possibly\n\n\f28\n\nJOZEF BOBOK AND ZBIGNIEW NITECKI\n\ntrivial) peripheral component P0\u00b1 (p). In this case, our Assumption 5.22 says\nthat at least one of the peripheral components has interior points mapping\nto Z(p), and we make sure P0+ (p) is of this type.\nUnder Assumption 5.22, we will construct a set W containing P which\nlocally divides H. This will be made up of sets of the form W (p) \u2283 Z(p)\nfor various edge equivalence classes in P.

If N \u2265 2 and no point interior to P (p) maps into Z(p),\nthen either P (p) = \u2205 (so zi+ is an endpoint of T for i = 0, . . . , N \u2212 1) or\nelse each Zi (p) is attached to a nontrivial peripheral component Pi (p), and\nfor i = 0, . . . , N \u2212 1 f (Pi (p)) \u2282 Pi+1 (p) (indices taken mod N ). In either\ncase, T \\ Z(p) has exactly one central component.\nThis follows immediately from Lemma 4.9.\n\n\u2666\n\nWe would like to establish an analogous picture when no interior point of\nC(p) maps to Z(p).\nProposition 5.24. If C(p) 6= \u2205 but f \u22121 [Z(p)] \u2229 C(p) = \u2205, then\n(1) T \\ Z(p) has a unique central component,\n(2) each component Zi (p) is attached to a nontrivial peripheral component Pi (p);\n(3) for i = 0, . . . , N \u2212 1 (taking indices mod N ),\nPi+1 (p) \u2282 f (Pi (p)) \u2282 C(p) \u222a Zi+1 (p) \u222a Pi+1 (p).\nProof. To establish the first statement, we will show that if T \\ Z(p) has\nat least two central components, then some interior point of C(p) maps\ninto Z(p). If there are at least two central components, Z(p) includes three\nintervals Zij (p), j = 1, 2, . . . , 3, such that Zi2 (p) \u2282 hZi1 (p), Zi3 (p)i, and no\nother intervals Zi (p), i 6= i1 , i2 , i3 intersect hZi1 (p), Zi3 (p)i. Since f (Zi (p)) =\nZi+1 (p) for all i (indices taken mod N ) and the Zi (p) are permuted, we can\nassume that Zi2 \u22121 (p) is not contained in hZi1 \u22121 (p), Zi3 \u22121 (p)i. But then the\ninterior of this hull is disjoint from all peripheral components and contains\na point mapping into Zi2 (p), which must then be interior to C(p).\nThis establishes the uniqueness of the central component. If Zi (p) touches\na peripheral component, we have already called it Pi (p); if not, then zi+ is\nan endpoint of the tree T , and we say Pi (p) is trivial. Since f |Z(p) is\nnot cocountably m-fold and Z(p) has no preimages in C(p), at least one\nperipheral component contains an interior point mapping into Z(p), and in\nparticular at least one Pi (p) is nontrivial.\nNow, suppose that for some j, Pj (p) is nontrivial. Since the map f is\nsurjective on T and C(p) \u222a Z(p) is invariant, Pj (p) \u2282 f (P (p)). We claim\nthat only Pj\u22121 (p) (mod N ) can contain preimages of interior points of Pj (p).\n\n\fTOPOLOGICAL ENTROPY OF m-fold MAPS ON TREES\n\n29\n\nNote that since C(p) 6= \u2205 requires N \u2265 2, the points zi+ are not fixedpoints,\nand in particular (by Assumption 5.1) have no preimages which are branchpoints. Now suppose some z \u2032 \u2208 Pi (p), i 6= j \u2212 1, has f (z \u2032 ) \u2208 int Pj (p). Then\nthe interval [zi+ , z \u2032 ] maps across a neighborhood of zj+ , which we can assume\nto contain no branchpoints. By Remark 4.6, we can find a subinterval J\nof [zi+ , z \u2032 ] which is disjoint from B(T ) mapping exactly onto this neighbor+\n(also disjoint from B(T )) has\nhood; but then some neighborhood U of zj\u22121\nf (U ) \u2282 f (J); since both U and J are comparable and disjoint from B(T ),\nRemark 4.8(1) tells us that zj+ \u2208\n/ H# , contradicting zj+ \u2208 Z0 (H).\nNote, however, that this shows that if Pj (p) is nontrivial, then so is\nPj\u22121 (p), and no other peripheral branch can have points mapping to its\ninterior. Inductively, this proves the proposition.\n\u0003\nTo continue our analysis, we need to track the dynamics of neighborhoods\nof the points zj\u00b1 . To this end, we assign to each endpoint zj\u00b1 of Zj (p) a set\nUj\u00b1 (p) as follows:\n(1) If zj+ is an endpoint of T , then Uj+ (p) := Zj (p);\n(2) Otherwise, Uj\u00b1 (p) is a one-sided neighborhood of zj\u00b1 , contained in\nthe closed component of T \\ Z(p) attached to zj\u00b1 .\nReducing the sets Uj\u00b1 (p) in case (2) if necessary, we can assume that they\nare pairwise disjoint, and that the interior of each one is disjoint from the\nfinite set B(T ) \u222a f (B(T )).\nGiven j \u2208 {0, ..., N \u2212 1} and \u03c3 \u2208 {+, \u2212}, we can track the action of f\n\u2212\n+\non Uj\u03c3 (p) by specifying a set \u03c6(Uj\u03c3 (p)) \u2208 {Uj+1\n(p), Uj+1\n(p), Zj+1 (p)}, well\n\u00b1\ndefined in view of Lemma 4.9 applied to zj \u2208 P \u2282 T \\ B(T ), according to\n(1) If f (Uj\u03c3 (p)) \u2282 Zj+1 (p), then \u03c6(Uj\u03c3 (p)) := Zj+1 (p)\n(2) Otherwise, \u03c6(Uj\u03c3 (p)) 6= Zj+1 (p) has nontrivial intersection with f (Uj\u03c3 (p)).\nExtending \u03c6 to \u03c6(Zj (p)) = Zj+1 (p), we have a self-map of the finite set\n{Uj\u2212 (p), Uj+ (p), Zj (p) | j = 0, ..., N \u22121} into itself, each orbit of which is eventually periodic. Automatically, \u03c6 has the trivial cycle Z0 (p) 7\u2192 Z1 (p) 7\u2192\n... 7\u2192 ZN \u22121 (p) 7\u2192 Z0 (p). As to nontrivial cycles, the two possibilities are:\n(1) A single nontrivial cycle of length 2N , with \u03c6N (Uj\u00b1 (p)) = Uj\u2213 (p) for\neach j (and all Uj\u00b1 (p) 6= Zj (p));\n(2) one or two nontrivial cycles (disjoint if there are two) of length N\n(\u03c6N (Uj\u00b1 (p)) = Uj\u00b1 (p)).\nSN \u22121 \u2212\nLet U := j=0\nUj (p)\u222aUj+ (p); abusing the terminology of \u00a75.1, we refer to\na point x \u2208 U as a satellite of Z(p) with time of flight t if f k (x) \u2208 U \\Z(p)\nfor k = 0, . . . , t \u2212 1. If t \u2265 2N , it is a persistent satellite. The local\nitinerary of a satellite x is the sequence of nontrivial sets Uj\u03c3 (p) containing\nsuccessive iterates of x: note that if f k (x) \u2208 Uj\u03c3 (p) \\ Z(p) and k < t \u2212 1\nthen f k+1 (x) \u2208 \u03c6(Uj\u03c3 (p)) \\ Z(p). We are interested in satellites whose orbit\n\n\f30\n\nJOZEF BOBOK AND ZBIGNIEW NITECKI\n\nsegment is contained in H\u2217 := H1 \u222a Hm ; for any such satellite, a color\nitinerary is a word w0 , ..., wt\u22121 with wi \u2208 {1, m} such that f i (x) \u2208 Hwi for\ni = 0, . . . , t \u2212 1.\nTo build a set W (p) that locally divides H we will try to find words in\nthe letters {1, m} which do not occur in any color itinerary of any persistent\nsatellite of Z(p).\nRemark 5.25.\n(1) If \u03c6N (Uj\u03c3 (p)) = Zj (p), then Uj\u03c3 (p) contains no persistent satellites of Z(p).\n(2) Any persistent satellite x has f N (x) contained in an element of a\nnontrivial \u03c6-cycle.\nThe following observations lead to a lemma which will be useful in proving\nthe existence of \"forbidden words\" for satellites of Z(p). We will say that a\npoint z \u2032\u2032 separates the points z and z \u2032 if it belongs to the interior of their\nconvex hull (this means that z and z \u2032 belong to different branches at z \u2032\u2032 ).\nLemma 5.26. Suppose y \u2208 hz \u2032 , zi such that int f (hy, zi) is disjoint from\nhf (z \u2032 ), f (z)i, B(T ), and f (B(T )). Then int hy, zi is disjoint from at least\none of the sets H1 , Hm .\nProof. First apply Remark 4.6 to the interval int f (hy, zi) to find a subinterval of hy, zi mapping exactly onto it; we can assume without loss of\ngenerality that y is an endpoint mapping to an endpoint of f (hy, zi), so that\nf (hy, zi) = hf (y), f (z)i. Now apply Remark 4.6 again, this time to find a\nsubinterval J \u2032 of hz \u2032 , yi mapping onto int f (hy, zi). By assumption, J \u2032 is\ndisjoint from B(T ) and hence comparable to hy, zi, and the lemma follows\nfrom Remark 4.8(1).\n\u0003\nThe next three lemmas provide the basis for constructing \"forbidden\nwords\" for satellites of Z(p). We fix p \u2208 P for these three results.\nLemma 5.27. Suppose int Uj\u2212 (p) is contained in a central component of\nT \\ Z(p) and \u03c6(Uj\u2212 (p)) \u2282 Pj+1 . Then at least one of H1 \u2229 int Uj\u2212 (p) and\nHm \u2229 int Uj\u2212 (p) is empty.\nProof. Let z = zj\u2212 , y an endpoint of Uj\u2212 (p), and pick z \u2032 \u2208 Z(p) \\ Zj (p)\nanother point in the central component of T \\ Z(p) containing Uj\u2212 (p). Since\nf (z \u2032 ) \u2208 Z(p) \\ Zj+1 (p) we have the situation of Lemma 5.26 and our conclusion follows.\n\u0003\n+\nLemma 5.28. Suppose {U0+ (p), ..., UN\n\u22121 (p)} is a nontrivial \u03c6-cycle with\nUi+ (p) \u2282 Pi for i = 0, . . . , N \u2212 1. If there exist points of P (p)\\Z(p) mapping\ninto Z(p), then for some i \u2208 {0, ..., N \u2212 1} and j \u2208 {1, m}, Hj \u2229 Ui+ (p) = \u2205.\n\nProof. Suppose z \u2032 \u2208 Pi \\ Z(p) with f (z \u2032 ) \u2208 Zi+1 (p), and let Ui+ (p) =\n[zi+ , zi+ + \u03b5). Then Lemma 5.26 applied to z = zi+ , y = zi+ + \u03b5 and z \u2032\ngives the desired conclusion.\n\u0003\n\n\fTOPOLOGICAL ENTROPY OF m-fold MAPS ON TREES\n\n31\n\nLemma 5.29. Suppose a nontrivial \u03c6-cycle has all elements in central components of T \\Z(p). If some point z \u2032 6\u2208 Z(p) contained in a central component\nmaps into Z(p), then some element of the cycle has interior disjoint from\neither H1 or Hm .\nProof. Suppose f (z \u2032 ) \u2208 Zj+1 (p), and Uj\u2212 (p) = hzj\u2212 \u2212\u03b5, zj\u2212 i; apply Lemma 5.26\nto z = zj\u2212 , y = zj\u2212 \u2212 \u03b5 and z \u2032 .\n\u0003\nProposition 5.30. Suppose p \u2208 P with f |Z(p) not cocountably m-fold.\nDefine a set W (p) \u2283 Z(p) as follows:\n(1) If T \\ Z(p) has exactly one central component, and no interior point\nof C(p) (resp. of P (p)) maps to Z(p), set\nW (p) := C(p) \u222a Z(p)\n\n(resp. P (p) \u222a Z(p))\n\nNote that in these cases N \u2265 2.\n(2) If N = 1 and one peripheral component P0\u2212 (p) has no interior points\nmapping to Z(p) or to the other peripheral component, then\nW (p) := Z(p) \u222a P0\u2212 (p).\n(3) In all other cases,\nW (p) := Z(p).\nThen\n(1) f (W (p)) \u2282 W (p).\n(2) For any open set U containing Z(p), U \\ W (p) 6= \u2205.\n(3) W (p) locally divides H.\nProof. The first property is trivial, and the second is nearly so: in any case,\nsince some points outside Z(p) map to it, T \\Z(p) is nonempty; furthermore,\nwhen we do adjoin a set to Z(p) to form W (p), there is always another endpoint of each Zj (p) to which a nontrivial component of T \\ Z(p) is attached.\nWe are left with the third property. We need to show that every persistent\nsatellite of Z(p) has its G-itinerary in some proper subset \u039b(p) \u2282 \u03a9m which\ndepends only on Z(p).\nSince every persistent satellite lands in a nontrivial \u03c6-cycle after at most\nN applications of f , we limit our attention to these.\nIf a nontrivial \u03c6-cycle includes subsets of both central and peripheral\ncomponents of T \\ Z(p), then Lemma 5.27 insures that a persistent satellite\nwith local itinerary in this cycle cannot have a color itinerary containing\nN successive occurences of some j \u2208 {1, m} (where j depends only on the\ncycle). Note that this situation must occur if either the cycle has length 2N\nor the cycle contains at least one peripheral element and the total number\nof central components exceeds 1.\nIf the cycle is entirely peripheral (resp. entirely central) and the peripheral\n(resp. central) components of T \\Z(p) contain at least one preimage of Z(p),\nthen Lemma 5.28 (resp. Lemma 5.29) again insures that any satellite with\n\n\f32\n\nJOZEF BOBOK AND ZBIGNIEW NITECKI\n\nlocal itinerary in this cycle cannot display N successive occurences of some\nj \u2208 {1, m}.\nThe exception that remains is when the union of the peripheral (resp.\ncentral) components of T \\ Z(p) is f -invariant and contains our \u03c6-cycle. In\nthese cases, we know that the union W (p) of Z(p) with all the peripheral\n(resp. central) components is f -invariant, and that there must be preimages\nof Z(p) outside W (p). In particular, no open set containing Z(p) is contained in W (p). If there is no nontrivial \u03c6-cycle outside W (p), then W (p)\nhas no persistent satellites, while if there is one then Lemma 5.28 (resp.\nLemma 5.29) applies to it.\n\u0003\nProposition 5.31. Under Assumption 5.22, we can find a subset Q \u2282 P\nsuch that\n[\nW (Q) :=\nW (q)\nq\u2208Q\n\nis a proper subset of T which contains Z(P) :=\n\nS\n\np\u2208P\n\nZ(p).\n\nProof. Note that if, for some p \u2208 P, W (p) is a connected proper superset of\nZ(p), then either\n(1) W (p) = C(p) \u222a Z(p), or\n(2) Z(p) has a single component Z0 (p), and W (p) = Z0 (p) \u222a P0\u2212 (p).\nIf any such points p \u2208 P exist, we pick p0 if possible of the first type and\nin any case so that W (p0 ) is maximal (in the sense that it is not a proper\nsubset of W (p) for any p \u2208 P of the same type). Now set\nQ := {p0 } \u222a {q \u2208 P | Z(q) 6\u2282 W (p0 )}.\nIn this case, we\nClaim: For any q \u2208 Q \\ {p0 }, W (q) \u2229 W (p0 ) = \u2205.\nTo see this in case 1, note that every such Z(q) must be contained in\nperipheral components of T \\ Z(p0 ), of which there is more than one and\nby Proposition 5.24, these are permuted transitively by f . In particular, q\ncannot also be of type 1, since then its central component C(q) (and hence\nW (q)) would contain W (p0 ), contradicting the maximality of the latter.\nBut then W (q) can consist only of Z(q) possibly together with peripheral\ncomponents of T \\ Z(q), which are separated from W (p0 ) by Z(q).\nIn case (1) fails but (2) holds, each Z(q) is contained in the single peripheral component P0+ (p0 ), and W (q) consists of Z(q) with the possible\naddition of peripheral components of T \\ Z(q), which again are separated\nfrom W (p0 ) by Z(q).\u2666\nNow, if no p \u2208 P satisfies (1) or (2), then for each p \u2208 P either W (p)\nconsists of Z(p) together with peripheral components, or else W (p) = Z(p).\nIf W (p)=Z(p) for all p \u2208 P, then clearly Q = P has the required property,\nwhile if some p \u2208 P has W (p) = Z(p) \u222a P (p) (with P (p) 6= \u2205), then C(p)\n\n\fTOPOLOGICAL ENTROPY OF m-fold MAPS ON TREES\n\n33\n\nis connected and we can pick p0 of this type for which W (p0 ) is maximal.\nThen\nQ = {p0 } \u222a {q \u2208 P | Z(q) \u2282 C(p0 )}\nworks, since any q \u2208 Q \\ {p0 } with W (q) 6= Z(q) has P (q) separated from\nW (p0 ) by Z(q).\n\u0003\nRemark 5.32. If Q is a set of the type described in Proposition 5.31, then\nW := W (Q)\ncontains P and locally divides H.\nTo see this, note that since f (Hi ) = T for all i and W 6= T , it follows that\nHi \\ W 6= \u2205 for each i, and Proposition 5.30 and Lemma 2.4 insures that\nevery orbit segment in a neighborhood of W either terminates in W or has\nits itineraries in a set \u039b \u2282 \u03a9m with entropy strictly less than log m.\n\u2666\n6. Proof of Main Theorem\nIn this section we indicate how the various threads of this paper can be\npulled together to prove Theorem 1.1, by fulfilling the hypotheses of Theorem 2.8. The key point is to combine Proposition 4.10, giving a spanning\nm-section with eventually countable kernel, and the results of \u00a7 5, characterizing the center of a spanning section. The following is the analogue of\nTheorem 6.7 in [BN05].\nLemma 6.1. Suppose f : T \u2192 T is a cocountably m-fold selfmap of a tree.\nUnder Assumptions 5.1 and 5.22, there exists a cocountable open set Y \u2282\nT and an m-section on Y such that the associated m-shift system H satisfies:\n(1) f (K(H)) is (at most) countable;\n(2) every minimal set in Z0 (H) is a periodic orbit;\n(3) there is a set W which contains every periodic orbit in Z0 (H) and\ndivides H.\nProof. By Proposition 4.10 there exists a cocountable open set Y \u2282 T \\\n[V(T ) \u222a f (V(T ))] and a monotone, spanning m-section \u03c8 on Y for which the\ncorresponding m-shift system H satisfies\n(15)\n\nf (K(H)) \u2229 Y = \u2205,\n\nwhich immediately implies the first condition above.\nIn particular, this also implies that any minimal set of f which is contained\nin the core Z0 (H) (and hence in the kernel) is a periodic orbit, since otherwise\nit would have to be uncountable.\nBut a combination of Corollary 5.14 and Proposition 5.31 (together with\nRemark 5.32 and Lemma 2.4) gives the existence of a set W which contains\nall periodic orbits in the core and which locally divides H.\n\u0003\n\n\f34\n\nJOZEF BOBOK AND ZBIGNIEW NITECKI\n\nBy Remark 5.2, we can assume Assumption 5.1 holds, while failure of\nAssumption 5.22 clearly gives the conclusion of Theorem 1.1. But this means\nthat Lemma 6.1 gives us the hypotheses of Theorem 2.8, and Theorem 1.1\nfollows immediately.\nReferences\n[ALM00] Lluis Alsed\u00e0, Jaume Llibre, and Michal Misiurewicz, Combinatorial dynamics\nin dimension one, 2 ed., Advanced Series in Nonlinear Dynamics, vol. 5, World\nScientific, 2000.\n[BN05] Jozef Bobok and Zbigniew Nitecki, Topological entropy of m-fold maps, Ergodic\nTheory and Dynamical Systems 25 (2005), 375\u2013401.\n[Bob02] Jozef Bobok, The topological entropy versus level sets for interval maps, Studia\nMathematica 152 (2002), 249\u2013261.\n[Bob05]\n, The topological entropy versus level sets for interval maps (part ii),\nStudia Mathematica 166 (2005), 11\u201327.\n[Cov94] Ethan Coven, Open problem session, International Journal of Bifurcation and\nChaos 8 (1994), 41.\n[Gri73] Christian Grillenberger, Constructions of strictly ergodic systems, Z.\nWahrscheinlichkeitstheorie u. verw.
