The sample was selected from the radio and is unbiased\ntoward detection at shorter wavelengths, but preferentially it includes beamed sources. We find that\nX-ray emission is common on kpc-scales, with over half (10/17) radio jets exhibiting at least one Xray knot on the Chandra images. A similar detection rate is found for the optical emission, although\nnot all X-ray knots have optical counterparts, and vice-versa. The distributions of the radio-to-X-ray\nand radio-to-optical spectral indices, \u03b1rx and \u03b1ro , for the detected jets are similar to the limits for the\nnon-detections, suggesting all bright radio jets have X-ray counterparts which will be visible in longer\nobservations. Comparing the radio and X-ray morphologies shows that the majority of the X-ray jets\nhave structures that closely map the radio. Analysis of the Spectral Energy Distributions of the jet\nknots suggest the knots in which the X-ray and radio morphologies track each other produce X-rays\nby inverse Compton (IC) scattering of the Cosmic Microwave Background (IC/CMB). The remaining\nknots produce X-rays by the synchrotron process. Spectral changes are detected along the jets, with\nthe ratio of the X-ray-to-radio and optical-to-radio flux densities decreasing from the inner to the outer\nregions. This suggests the presence of an additional contribution to the X-ray flux in the jet's inner part,\neither from synchrotron or IC of the stellar light. Alternatively, in a pure IC/CMB scenario, the plasma\ndecelerates as it flows from the inner to the outer regions. Finally, the X-ray spectral indices for the\nbrightest knots are flat (photon index \u0393X \u223c 1.5), indicating that the bulk of the luminosity of the jets\nis emitted at GeV energies, and raising the interesting possibility of future detections with GLAST.\nSubject Headings:Galaxies: active - galaxies: jets - (galaxies:) quasars: individual - X-rays:\ngalaxies\nThe launch of Chandra, with its improved resolution and\nsensitivity over previous X-ray satellites, opened a new\nwindow for the study of jets, allowing for the first time\nimaging spectroscopy studies of these structures. The first\nChandra light, the distant quasar PKS 0637\u2212752, surprisingly showed a bright, kpc-scale X-ray jet (Chartas et al.\n2000), with only a weak optical counterpart in archival\nHST data (Schwartz et al. 2000). Indeed, intense X-ray\nemission had been detected from radio jets that were not\nknown to have optical counterparts (e.g., Pictor A; Wilson, Young, & Shopbell 2001), and studies of previously\nknown synchrotron optical jets showed that the X-rays do\nnot always lie on the extrapolation of the optical emission,\nchallenging simple synchrotron models (e.g., M87, Wilson\n& Yang 2002; 3C 273, Sambruna et al. 2001). It quickly\nbecame clear that the X-ray emission from jets is very\n\n1. introduction\n\nBefore the advent of the Chandra X-ray Observatory in\n1999, X-ray emission from kiloparsec-scale jets in Active\nGalactic Nuclei (AGNs) was virtually unknown. Only a\nfew X-ray jets were known from the previous generation\nof X-ray telescopes (mainly Einstein and ROSAT), including the optical jets of M87 and 3C 273 (see Sparks, Biretta,\n& Macchetto 1997 and references therein) and the radio\njets of Centaurus A and NGC 6251 (Feigelson et al. 1981,\nMack et al. 1997). A few more jets were known to emit\nin the optical, an extension of the radio synchrotron emission (e.g., Scarpa & Urry 2002; Sparks et al. 1994). With\nonly about a dozen of the hundreds of the known radio jets\ndetected at both optical and X-rays, high-energy emission\nwas viewed as an exotic phenomenon.\n1\n\n\f2\ncomplex.\nThe bright X-ray flux in PKS 0637\u2013752 could not be\nwell explained as synchrotron emission or synchrotron-self\nCompton (Schwartz et al. 2000), but was instead attributed to inverse Compton (IC) scattering of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons by relativistic electrons in the jet, with jet Lorentz factors \u0393 \u223c 10 (Tavecchio\net al. 2000; Celotti et al. 2001). The IC/CMB model can\nalso account for the X-ray emission from some knots in\nthe 3C 273 jet (Sambruna et al. 2001) and for the distant jet in the gravitationally lensed quasar Q0957+561\n(Chartas et al. 2002). Because of the (1 + z)4 dependence\nof the CMB density, compensating the surface brightness\ndimming, high-redshift jets should in fact be as bright at\nX-rays as low-z jets (Schwartz 2002).\nThus, early Chandra results showed that X-ray emission\nfrom kpc-scale jets may be more common than previously\nthought on the basis of lower sensitivity detectors. Moreover, a reanalysis of the HST archival data prompted by\nthe Chandra results yielded a few more optical detections,\nshowing that optical emission from jet may also be common (e.g., Cheung 2002, Schwartz et al. 2000). Additionally, Chandra is now showing that the terminal lobes and\nhotspots in powerful FRII jets emit at X-rays, although\nthe origin of the X-ray flux from these structures is still a\nmatter of debate (e.g., Hardcastle et al. 2002a).\nWe initiated a systematic study of the optical and X-ray\nemission from extended jets in AGN, in order to address\ntheir physical properties (magnetic fields, particle energy\ndistributions, plasma speeds and power), surveying a welldefined sample of radio jets with Chandra and HST with\nrelatively short exposures. The results for the first six targets observed were presented in Sambruna et al. (2002;\nhereafter Paper I). Here we report the X-ray results for\nthe whole sample of 17 jets; the six targets of Paper I\nwere reanalyzed in light of the improved ACIS calibration\nand the HST results. We determine jet detection rates,\ncompare the multiwavelength morphologies, and discuss\nemission mechanisms and outstanding questions regarding\nextended jet emission. We reanalyzed archival VLA radio\ndata. The radio and optical data on the jets are presented\nin detail in Cheung et al. (2004) and Urry et al. (2004),\nrespectively, while the unresolved X-ray emission from the\nnuclei of the sample objects is discussed in Gambill et al.\n(2003). A multiwavelength study of the hotspots and lobe\nfeatures will be presented in a future paper.\nThe plan of this paper is as follows. In \u00a7 2 we review\nthe sample selection criteria, and in \u00a7 3 the observations\nand the data analysis. In \u00a7 4 we present the results, and\nin \u00a7 5 we discuss the origin of the X-ray emission from\nthe kpc-scale jets and their physical properties. Summary\nand conclusions are reported in \u00a7 6. Throughout this work,\nH0 = 75 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 and q0 = 0.5 are adopted.\n2. the jet sample\n\nThe targets of the program were selected according to\nradio-driven criteria, without knowledge of the optical and\nX-ray emission properties. In this sense, the survey is unbiased toward emission at the longer wavelengths. However,\nthe survey is biased toward beaming because of the radio\nselection criteria (see below).\nThe survey sample was chosen from the list of known\n\nradio jets of Bridle & Perley (1984) and Liu & Xie (1992),\naccording to the following criteria. (1) The radio jet has\n> 5mJy/arcsec2 at > 3\u2032\u2032 from\nsurface brightness S1.4 GHz \u223c\nthe nucleus, i.e., long enough and bright enough to be detected in reasonable Chandra and HST exposures for average values of the radio-to-X-ray and radio-to-optical spectral indices, \u03b1rx \u223c 0.8 and \u03b1ro \u223c 0.8. (2) High-resolution\n(1\u2032\u2032 or better) published or archival radio maps show that\n> 5 mJy) radio knot is present at >\nat least one bright ( \u223c\n3\u2032\u2032 from the nucleus. The resulting sample of 17 radio jets\nspans a range of redshifts, core and extended radio powers, and classifications: 16 sources are classified as quasars\nand are hosted by ellipticals classified as powerful FanaroffRiley II (FRII; Fanaroff & Riley 1974) radio galaxies, while\nthe low-power, nearby source 0836+299 is hosted by a radio galaxy with FRI morphology (most apparent on low\nfrequency maps; van Breugel et al. 1986).\nThe targets are listed in Table 1 together with their basic properties: redshift (column 3), scale conversion (projected size; column 4), Galactic column density (column\n5), radio classification of the core (column 6), core radio\npower at 5 GHz (columns 7), ratio of core to extended radio power, Ri (column 8), and limits on the ratio of the\njet-to-counterjet fluxes, J (column 9). Measurements of Ri\nare traditionally used to separate lobe-dominated (Ri < 1)\nfrom core-dominated (Ri > 1) radio sources, although the\nmeasured values are sensitive to the observing frequency\n(e.g., Orr & Browne 1982). At lower observing frequencies, where the steep spectrum lobes will become more\nprominent, Ri values may decrease. Indeed, 1.65 GHz\nobservations (published, and our own analysis of archival\ndata; Cheung et al. 2004) indicate that 3 of the 11 source\nclassified as Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) based\non the 5 GHz data, have Ri values less than unity at 1.65\nGHz, indicating that they are more Steep Spectrum Radio\nQuasar (SSRQ)-like or simply less beamed FSRQs.\nIn general, all the sources of the sample show one-sided\njets, indicating substantial beaming. In addition, most of\nthe sources exhibit superluminal motion at VLBI scales\nwith large apparent speeds, again indicating beaming. Indeed, most sources are classified as FSRQs. The coreto-lobe ratio, Ri , can be used as a beaming indicator\nwith scatter depending on the scatter in intrinsic coreto-extended luminosity.\nDuring Chandra Cycle 2, we were awarded 10 kilo second (ks) exposures for 16 of the 17 sources with Chandra\nACIS-S, and one orbit per target with HST for all 17 targets. The X-ray flux limit for a 2\u03c3 detection in a typical\n10-ks ACIS-S observation is F0.5\u22128keV \u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u221215 erg\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 . The Chandra observations of the 17th source,\n3C 207, was awarded to other investigators (Brunetti et al.\n2002), with a 37 ks exposure. Here we include the archival\nChandra data of 3C 207, which we reanalyzed to ensure\nuniformity with the remaining sources and in light of the\nimproved calibration. The six sources previously discussed\nin Paper I (0723+679, 1055+018, 1136\u2212135, 1150+497,\n1354+195, and 2251+134) have been also reanalyzed and\nare included here. It is important to note that the short\nChandra and HST exposures of this survey were designed\nto detect the X-ray/optical counterpart of the radio jets,\nleaving detailed studies of jet morphologies and spectra for\ndeeper follow-up observations.\n\n\f3\n3. data acquisition, reduction, and analysis\n\n3.1. Chandra Data\nThe Chandra observations were performed with ACISS with the source at the aimpoint of the S3 chip. Since\nwe expected bright X-ray cores, we used 18 subarray mode\nwith an effective frame time of 0.4 s, to reduce the effect\nof pileup of the nucleus. In addition, for each source, a\nrange of roll angles was specified in order to locate the\njet away from the charge transfer trail of the nucleus and\navoid flux contamination. Nevertheless, the cores of 10/17\nsources were affected by pileup (Gambill et al. 2003). The\n>\nfraction of core pileup is \u223c 5%, according to the measured\n>\ncounts per frame ( \u223c 0.26 counts per frame). The distance\nfrom the core at which the PSF wings can contaminate the\njet varies with the level of core pileup in the specific targets. The sources with the largest amount of core pileup\nare 0405\u2212123 and 1150+497, with 0.5 c/frame.\nThe Chandra data were reduced following standard\nscreening criteria and using the latest calibration files provided by the Chandra X-ray Center. The latest version of\nthe reduction software CIAO v. 2.3 was used. Pixel randomization was removed, and only events for ASCA grades\n0, 2\u20134, and 6 and in the energy range 0.5\u20138 keV, in which\nthe background is negligible and the ACIS-S calibration\nbest known, were retained. We also checked that no flaring\nbackground events occurred during the observations. After screening, the effective exposure times range between 7\nand 10 ks, with one object (0838+133) observed for much\nlonger, 23.9 ks (Table 2). Note that these exposures are\nslightly different from those in Paper I and Gambill et al.\n(2003), due to the revised ACIS-S calibration.\nSeveral counterparts to radio jet features were detected\nin the X-ray band in our Chandra images (Figures 1, 2, and\nTable 2). X-ray counts from each knot were extracted in a\ncircular region of radius 1\u2032\u2032 , with the background estimated\nin a circular region of radius 10\u2032\u2032 at a nearby position free of\nspurious X-ray sources. For a point source, the extraction\n>\nradius of 1\u2032\u2032 encircles \u223c 90% of the flux density at 1 keV,\nbased on the ACIS-S encircled energy fraction (Fig.6.3 in\nthe Chandra Proposer Observatory Guide). We corrected\nthe X-ray fluxes for this effect. We determined corrections\nto the ancillary response files by simulating the spectra\nof point sources at the locations of the images within the\napertures used in our analysis to correct for the remaining\nflux. For our simulations we used XSPEC to generate the\nsource spectra and the ray-tracing tool MARX to model the\ndependence of photon scattering with energy.\nHowever, in two instances, a circular extraction region of\nradius 1.5\u2032\u2032 was used instead of the standard 1.0\u2032\u2032 region.\nA larger region was used when the lobe or counterlobe\nemission evidently spread beyond the 1.0\u2032\u2032 aperture, since\nlobe emission is more diffuse than the concentrated emission of the knots in lower frequency observations. When\ntwo optical knots were observed with HST, but were unresolved in the Chandra image, a larger region was applied\nfor the extraction of X-rays since it could contain all of the\nemission from the two optical knots.\nIn several cases, optical knots were detected with HST\n<\nat \u223c 1\u20132\u2032\u2032 from the core, where a significant contribution\nfrom the PSF wings could be present. Inspection of the X-\n\nray maps showed an excess of the flux above the PSF wings\nat the position of the inner knots. To derive the net X-ray\nflux for all the inner knots, we adopted the following pro<\ncedures: (1) For knots detected with HST at \u223c 1.5\u2032\u2032 from\nthe core, we extracted the counts from a circular aperture\nof radius 0.5\u2032\u2032 centered on the optical position of the knot.\n(2) For knots detected with HST between 1.5\u20132.2\u2032\u2032 from\nthe core, we extracted the counts from a circular aperture of radius 1.0\u2032\u2032 centered on the optical position of the\nknot. To subtract the contribution of the PSF, the background was evaluated in a circular region with the same\nradius and distance from the core used for extraction (0.5\u2032\u2032\nor 1.0\u2032\u2032 depending on the distance from the core), but at\nthree different azimuth angles, chosen so as to avoid possible contamination from pileup and counter-features.\nWe find that the net (background-subtracted) counts\nvary by as much as 30% depending on the background\nregion. This large uncertainty derived from background\nposition in the region of the nucleus suggests local nonuniformities of the core PSF, attributable to the significant\neffect of pileup on the core PSF for some sources (Gambill et al. 2003). Given the large excursion of values, the\ncounts reported in Tables 2 and 3 for these inner knots\n(generally coincident with knot A) are simple average values, while the uncertainties are their standard deviations.\nThus, the values for net X-ray counts represent rather conservative estimates for the X-ray fluxes of these knots.\nThe net X-ray count rates or upper limits to them are\nlisted in Tables 2 and 3. Following Paper I, the count\nrates and relative uncertainties are calculated according\nto the following steps. Let S be the total (before background subtraction) counts in the source area AS , and b\nthe background counts in the area AB . The background\ncounts rescaled to the source region are B = bAs /AB .\nThe net counts of the source are thus N = S \u2212 B. The\nuncertainties of the net X-ray counts, \u03c3N , were calculated\naccording to the formula \u03c3N = [(\u03c3S )2 + (\u03c3B )2 ]1/2 , where\n\u03c3S and \u03c3B are the uncertainties of the source and background, respectively. The latter were calculated following\nGehrels (1986), as appropriate in a regime of low counts:\n\u03c3S = 1+(S+0.75)1/2 and \u03c3B = [1+(b+0.75)1/2](AS /AB ).\nWe define as detections only the knots/hotspots for\nwhich the significance of the X-ray counts is at least 2\u03c3.\nWhen the detected X-ray counts are significant at less than\n2\u03c3, an upper limit is given in Table 3, as a 1\u03c3 upper limit\n(column 6) and as a count rate (column 7). The upper\nlimits were extracted in a 1\u2032\u2032 radius region centered on the\nradio position of the knot, with the background estimated\nas discussed above for the case of the detections.\nUpper limits are also given in Table 3 for all the radio\nfeatures which were detected in the optical in our HST images, but which do not have an X-ray counterpart. Moreover, in some cases faint X-ray counts in excess of the\nbackground were detected nearby, but not quite coincident with, a radio feature. As it is unclear whether these\nexcess counts represent a true detection or rather a background fluctuation or even a foreground source, conservatively we give an upper limit to the X-ray count rate in\nTable 3. These cases include 0802+103, 0836+299 knot\nA, 1055+018, 1741+279 knot A and hotspot B; each is\nlabeled with a question mark in Table 3.\nFor the knots in Table 2a with 40 counts or more we\n\n\f4\nextracted X-ray spectra in an aperture of radius 1\u2032\u2032 centered on the knot (the same region used to extract the\ncounts). The spectra were rebinned in order to have at\nleast 5 counts in each new bin, and fitted with XSPEC\nv.11.2 in the energy range 0.5\u20138 keV, where the calibration is best known and the background negligible.\nThe C-statistics, appropriate for low signal-to-noise ratio\ndata, were used to derive the spectral parameters. The\nbackground-subtracted spectra were fitted with a single\npower law model with fixed Galactic column density, using the Morrison & McCammon (1983) cross section and\nsolar abundances. We report the spectral index in column 10 of Table 2a. Errors are 90% confidence for one\nparameter of interest.\n3.2. HST Data\nThe results from our HST imaging are described in detail in Urry et al. (2004). In short, we imaged all 17 objects\nwith the STIS CCD in CLEAR (unfiltered) imaging mode,\nwhich is more sensitive than the HST WFPC2 camera for\ndetecting faint point sources. The purpose of these exposures was simply to identify optical emission associated\nwith the jets, allowing for more color-sensitive, deeper,\nfollow-up studies later. The observations were carried out\nfrom November 2000 to February 2001, with 2251+134\nobserved in August 2001, and in general were not simultaneous to the Chandra exposures. The one orbit per target\nawarded amounted to an average of \u223c 2,700 sec of total\nintegration time from a series of shorter exposures for 16\nof the objects. The quasar 0723+679 was a continuous\nviewing zone target, so we were able to obtain a longer sequence of exposures totaling 4,680 seconds. The individual\nexposures were stacked and cosmic rays removed using the\nCRREJ task in IRAF. Optical emission from the radio jets\nwas identified via digital overlays with our high resolution\nVLA images. Count rates for the detected optical jet features were converted to flux densities utilizing the inverse\nsensitivity measurements contained in the PHOTFLAM keyword inside the image headers which approximately gives\n1.08 \u00d7 10\u22127 (Jy \u00d7 count rate\u22121 ) at a pivot wavelength\nof 5852 \u00c5. The fairly uniform quality of the 17 datasets\nallows us to estimate conservatively that the point source\nsensitivity limit in each image is approximately 0.06 \u03bcJy\n(3\u03c3), judging by the fact that the weakest bona fide optical\ndetections were of order 0.02 \u03bcJy (in 1040+123, 1150+497,\nand 1642+690; see Urry et al. 2004). It is important to\nstress that this limit is applicable only to point sources\nand presumes that the non-detected optical counterparts\nwould appear as unresolved features in deeper HST images. Specifically, this limit does not apply to diffuse features.\nOptical flux densities for the Spectral Energy Distributions described in \u00a7 5 were extracted as follows. The optical fluxes were obtained by summing up the contributions\nof the HST detected features which laid within the specified X-ray apertures (usually, only one optical knot). For\nthe features at small angular separations from the nucleus\n<\nwhich were detected in our HST data ( \u223c 1.5\u2032\u2032 ; marked\nwith a footnote in Tables 2 and 3), the corresponding radio and optical flux densities are quoted directly from Urry\n1\n\net al. (2004). The radio and optical images achieved comparable resolution so we were able to uniquely match the\noptically detected features with peaks in the radio jet. The\nUrry et al. (2004) radio fluxes were therefore measured by\nfitting the radio jet knots with elliptical Gaussian components in the (u,v) plane using the DIFMAP modelfit program. Since the radio knots tended to be smaller than\n1\u2032\u2032 in size, fluxes measured in this manner will give generally smaller fluxes than those obtained with the larger\napertures we used to measure radio fluxes for the more distant X-ray emitting features discussed above. Care should\nbe taken in comparing the radio fluxes in this paper with\nthose presented in Urry et al. (2004). Because the optical\nknots were often faint point-like sources which appear over\na relatively large background in the HST images, optical\nfluxes were obtained by measuring count rates in successively increasing circular apertures centered on the optical\npeak until a plateau was reached \u2013 this mimics an infinite\nradius aperture.\n3.3. Archival Radio Data\nOur complete analysis of the radio images along with\npolarization information, will be presented in detail in\na forthcoming paper (Cheung et al. 2004). In summary, Very Large Array (Thompson et al. 1980) data\nat 5 GHz was gathered from the NRAO1 archive for all\n17 targets. Most of the observations utilized the VLA\nin its highest resolution A-configuration which gives better than 0.5\u2032\u2032 resolution at this frequency. For the larger\nsources, we used data from the B-configuration (0405\u2212123,\n1928+738), or combined data from both the A- and Bconfigurations (1055+018, 1354+195) so the resultant images achieved resolutions of order 1\u2032\u2032 . The quality of the\nimages is not uniform due to the fact that the data were\nobtained from separate programs with widely different integration times so care must be taken in inspecting the\nradio-derived parameters in Table 1. The most shallow\nimage is the 6-min snapshot of 2251+134; the best images are dedicated full-track observations of 0836+299 and\n1040+123 where almost 3 hrs of data were obtained. The\nfinal images presented in Figures 1 and 2 are restored with\ncircular beams and are shown at full resolution in order to\ndisplay details in the radio jets not obvious in the Chandra\nimages, which have 0.86\u2032\u2032 resolution.\nThe basic calibration was performed in AIPS (Bridle & Greisen 1994b) and then outputted to the Caltech DIFMAP package (Shepherd, Pearson, & Taylor 1994)\nfor self-calibration and imaging. Much of the data has\nbeen previously published and our recalibration benefited to different degrees from improved computing power\nin especially the self-calibration process. We refer to\nthe original papers for any more specific information on\nthese data: 0405\u2212123, 1928+738 (Rusk 1988); 0605\u2212085,\n1510\u2212089, and 1642+690 (O'Dea, Barvainis, & Challis\n1988); 0802+103 (Kronberg et al. 1990); 0836+299 (van\nBreugel et al. 1986); 2251+134 (Price et al. 1993). The\n0723+679 and 1150+497 data were published by Owen &\nPuschell (1984) and were reprocessed from calibrated data\nobtained directly from F. Owen. The image of 1136\u2212135\nwas made by combining snapshot observations published\n\nThe National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National Science Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by\nAssociated Universities, Inc.\n\n\f5\nseparately by Saikia et al. (1989) and Aldcroft et al.\n(1993).\nWe were unable to locate the references for the remaining data used and assume that they are unpublished. We\nlist these data along with the observer names and their\nVLA program codes: 0838+133 (J.F.C. Wardle & R.I.\nPotash, unpublished); 1040+123 (R.L Brown: AB244);\n1055+018 (W. van Breugel: AM213, B. Wills: AS396, and\ndata from Rusk 1988), 1354+195 (P. Barthel: AB331B,\nB. Wills: AS396); 1641+399 (R.A. Perley: AC120);\n1741+279 (F. Owen: AH170, and data from Price et al.\n1993). Our 5 GHz image of 1928+738 was of poor quality so it was supplemented with an archival 1.4 GHz VLA\ndataset (T. Rector: AS596). The 1.4 GHz image is plotted in Figure 1. The radio flux of the X-ray detected knot\nin the jet (Table 5) was obtained from the 5 GHz data\nand we found it to be consistent with a previous measurement by Hummel et al. (1992). The images presented here\nfor 1055+018, 1136\u2212135, and 1354+195 are improved versions of the data presented in Paper I.\n4. results\n\nFigure 1 shows the Chandra images of the 17 jets of\nthe sample. The X-ray images were produced by smoothing the raw Chandra data with a Gaussian of standard\ndeviation 0.3\u2032\u2032 in the energy range 0.5\u20138 keV, with final\nresolution of 0.86\u2032\u2032 FWHM. Overlaid on the X-ray images\nare the radio contours from the archival VLA data. Different smoothing factors were used for individual objects;\ndetails on the radio images are given for each source in the\nAppendix.\nFigure 2 shows the zoomed-in images of selected jets for\nwhich knots close to the core were detected. The images\nwere binned in 0.1x 0.1 pixel bins (where 1 pixel is \u223c 0.5\u2032\u2032 )\nand smoothed with Gaussian of FWHM = 0.25\u2032\u2032 .\nWe define jets, knots, lobes, and hotspots on the basis\nof the radio emission morphology following Bridle et al.\n(1994a), namely, a jet is a narrow feature that is at least\nfour times as long as it is wide and a knot is a compact\nregion of brightness in the jet. A lobe region refers to any\nremaining radio emission not contained in the jet, and is\ngenerally diffuse emission. A hotspot is a compact feature\nwithin the lobe. We distinguish a knot from a hotspot\nbased on whether the feature is located within the extended jet (a knot) or beyond its end (a hotspot). The\nposition marking the end of the jet is determined by any\nof the following: (1) a disappearance of emission, (2) an\n>\nabrupt change of direction ( \u223c 30\u25e6 within a space equal to\nthe jet width) for the jet emission, or (3) a decollimation\nof the emission by more than a factor of two. The classification of X-ray features is based purely on that of their\npresumed radio counterparts.\nAs is apparent in Figure 1, X-ray counterparts to the\nradio knots are detected in most sources. In other cases,\nonly features in the lobes are detected, either diffuse emission from the lobes themselves or from compact hotspots\nwithin them. Details of the results for individual sources\nare given in the Appendix.\nTable 2 lists the detected X-ray features in the jets. In\nTable 2a we list the detected knots, while in Table 2b we\nlist the detected hotspots (and in a few cases, diffuse lobe\nemission), together with their basic properties: name of\n\nthe feature (column 3) and its distance from the core (column 4), Position Angle (PA, column 5), and net X-ray\ncounts (column 6). Column 7 in Table 2 flags the features\nthat were also detected in the optical (Urry et al. 2004).\nContrary to Paper I, where the nomenclature was X-raydriven, in this paper the knots were named following the\noptical nomenclature. This is because HST has a higher\nresolution and generally detected inner knots, which can\nnot be directly resolved with ACIS-S. In turn, the optical nomenclature follows previous radio publications when\nappropriate (e.g., 1150+497; Akujor & Garrington 1991).\nWith respect to Paper I, the knot nomenclature changed\nonly for 0723+679 and 1150+497. In the case of 0723+679,\nknot C in this paper corresponds to knot A in Paper I, and\nknot D to knot B in Paper I. In the case of 1150+497, knot\nB in this paper corresponds to knot A in Paper I, knot E\ncorresponds to knot B in Paper I, and knot H corresponds\nto knot C in Paper I.\nWe measured the full-widths at half maximum (FWHM)\nof the detected X-ray features in Table 2 in a direction perpendicular to the jet axis (locally, as some jets bend), in\nthe energy range 0.5\u20138 keV. The widths are reported in\ncolumn 8 of Table 2. For comparison, the ACIS-S FWHM\nresolution is 0.5\u2032\u2032 at 1 keV. In most cases, the X-ray knots\n<\nare unresolved (widths \u223c 1\u2032\u2032 ), while several others are\nlarger than the instrumental resolution. It is worth noting\nthat all the knots whose radial profiles are consistent with\nsimple Gaussians are unresolved; the resolved knots are\ngenerally consistent with more complex profiles, including\nmultiple peaks (0723+679 B, 1150+497 F, 1354+195 A, B,\nF, 1510\u2212089 B, C); most likely these knots include multiple emission regions that are not individually resolved\nwith Chandra (but when they have an optical counterpart, they are resolved with HST). It is also worth noting\nthat the knot widths in Table 2 were derived from fullband 0.5\u20138 keV radial profiles, while the encircled energy\nfraction decreases with increasing energy because of larger\nX-ray scattering (75% at 1.5 keV to 65% at 6.4 keV for\nan extraction radius of 1\u2032\u2032 ). Therefore, a more appropriate comparison should be performed for monochromatic\nprofiles; however, the signal-to-noise ratio of the present\nobservations is insufficient to extract radial profiles in narrow spectral ranges.\nIn the last column of Table 2a we list the photon index, \u03930.5\u22128 keV , from the fits to the ACIS spectra of the\nknots with a power law plus Galactic NH model (see \u00a7 3.1).\nErrors are 90% confidence for one parameter of interest.\nThe indices are extremely flat, \u03930.5\u22128 keV =1.3\u20131.6, for all\nknots, indicating very hard spectra with more energy produced above the Chandra band. The only exception is knot\nA in 1928+738, where \u03930.5\u22128 keV =2.66. The average index\nand 1\u03c3 dispersions are h\u0393knots i = 1.52 and \u03c3knots = 0.21,\nrespectively.\nUpper limits to the X-ray counts for the radio knots and\n<\nhotspots not detected in our Chandra images (i.e., \u223c 2\u03c3\ndetections) are reported in Tables 3a and 3b, respectively,\nfollowing the criteria described above. Optical detections\nare flagged in column 8. Uncertainties are 1\u03c3.\nIn all cases, the count rates in Table 2 and 3 agree with\nthose listed in Paper I within the uncertainties. After a\ncareful reanalysis of the HST images, we discovered optical\ncounterparts to the innermost radio knots of 0723+679 and\n\n\f6\n2251+134, knots A (Urry et al. 2004). This prompted us\nto report in Table 3 the corresponding X-ray counts, determined as described in \u00a7 3.1. In addition, for 1136\u2212135 the\nreanalysis of the ACIS image provided a detection in Xrays of the innermost feature at 2.3\u2032\u2032 from the core, marked\n\u03b1 in Figure 1 and in Table 2a. This feature, which has a\nweak radio counterpart and is undetected in the optical, is\nconfirmed in our deeper (80 ks) follow-up Chandra Cycle\n4 observation (paper in prep.).\nIn Paper I, it was incorrectly stated that knot I in\n1354+195 (the hotspot) was off the HST field of view.\nIn the present reanalysis we realized that knot I falls in\nthe HST field of view, however, it is not optically detected\nand none of the conclusions of Paper I are affected.\n4.1. Detection Rates at X-rays and Optical\nOne of the goals of the survey is to establish whether\nhigh-energy emission from kpc-scale jets is a common\nproperty given a certain morphology and intensity of radio emission. Table 4 summarizes the detection rates at\nX-rays and optical.\nAt X-rays, counting only the firm detections in Table 2a,\nthe detection rate of jets is 59%. This number is probably\na conservative lower limit. In fact, if we add the marginal\ndetections in Table 3a, such as 1040+123, 1741+279, and\n2251+134, where knots were tentatively resolved in the inner regions, the detection rate of jets at X-rays becomes\n76%.\nIn the optical, we find a similar detection rate (Table 4).\nHowever, not all the knots detected at optical have X-ray\ncounterparts, and vice-versa. The only radio jets detected\nat optical, but not at X-rays, are 1040+123 and 2251+134.\nThe only jets detected at X-rays, but not at optical, are\n0605\u2013085 and 1510\u2013089. Only 2 sources, 0802+103 and\n1055+018, have no detection at either wavelength.\nIn Figure 3a we plot the distribution of the radio-to-Xray spectral index for the jet knots, \u03b1rx , defined between\n5 GHz and 1 keV (see \u00a7 4.4 and Tables 5 and 6). The\nfilled histograms represent X-ray detections; upper limits\nare marked with arrows. As is apparent from the Figure,\nthe \u03b1rx distribution is consistent with our selection criteria\n(\u03b1rx \u223c 0.8). Using the statistical package asurv (Feigelson & Nelson 1985), we estimated the probability Pasurv\nthat the observed distribution of \u03b1rx in Figure 3a is drawn\nfrom a Gaussian distribution centered on \u03b1rx = 0.8, with\nwidth equal to the observed width at half maximum in Figure 3a. Depending on the test used within the package,\n>\nPasurv \u223c 90%. The average value of \u03b1rx is h\u03b1rx i=0.88\nwith dispersion \u03c3rx =0.08.\nIn Figure 3a, the non-detections span the same range of\nindices as for the detections. This indicates that, due to\nnon-uniformities in the observations and background, even\nthe flattest bins are not completely covered. Thus, there\nis reason to expect that essentially all bright radio jets\nhave associated X-ray emission, which would be apparent\nin deeper and better resolved maps.\nFigure 3b shows the distributions of the radio-to-optical\nindex, \u03b1ro , defined between 5 GHz and 5852 \u00c5 (\u00a7 4.4),\nfor the jet knots. As in Figure 3a, the dashed area represents solid optical detections while the arrows indicate\nthe upper limits to the optical flux (Urry et al. 2004). Us<\ning asurv, we find a probability Pasurv \u223c 85% that the\n\nobserved distribution is consistent with a Gaussian distribution centered on \u03b1ro = 0.8. The average value of \u03b1ro\nin Figure 3b is h\u03b1ro i = 1.05 with dispersion \u03c3ro =0.12.\nWe conclude the observed distribution of \u03b1ro is consistent\nwith steeper values than assumed. The upper limits are\ndistributed throughout the full range of values for the detections. However, since fewer optical knots were detected,\ndetermining the true distribution will require deeper observations.\nAlthough our sample was not optimized for Xray/optical study of the hotspots/lobes, we detect a fair\nnumber of them (Table 4). Specifically, X-ray emission\nfrom hotspots/lobes was detected in 7/17 sources, with\nan optical counterpart in 4 cases. Figures 3c and 3d\nshow the distributions of the \u03b1rx and \u03b1ro indices for the\nhotspots/lobes. Both distributions indicate steeper indices\nthan for the jet knots; in fact, the flattest values, easiest to\ndetect, are missing. For Figures 3c and 3d, h\u03b1rx i = 1.03\nand \u03c3rx =0.05 and h\u03b1ro i = 1.17 and \u03c3rx =0.15.\nFinally, in 5/17 sources there is a weak X-ray detection of the counterlobe (0723+679, 0838+133, 0836+299,\n1040+123, and 1136\u2013135). X-ray emission from the counterlobe of 0838+133 was interpreted by Brunetti et al.\n(2002) as back-scattered Compton flux, and a similar\nexplanation may hold for 0723+679 (Paper I). While\n0723+679, 0838+133, 1040+123, and 1136\u2013135 are powerful FRIIs, the radio galaxy 0836+299 exhibits an FRI\nmorphology and has a radio power similar to an FRI (van\nBreugel et al. 1986). Both hotspots in the lobe and counterlobe in 0836+299 have an optical counterpart. However, the optical emission from the Northern hotspot is\nprobably due to emission lines (van Breugel et al. 1986).\nSince our very broad filter does not distinguish emission\nlines from continuum, we do not quote an optical flux for\nthis feature.\n4.2. Jet Multiwavelength Morphologies\nX-rays versus radio: Concentrating on a comparison of\nthe radio and X-ray jets in Figure 1, a variety of morphologies is apparent. In most cases, the X-rays track the radio\none-to-one, i.e., all X-ray knots have a radio counterpart.\nThe jet of 1136\u2212135 stands out for its remarkable multiwavelength morphology. As clearly shown in Figure 1,\nthere is weak or no radio emission from the inner jet which\ninstead is detected at X-rays (knots \u03b1, A), and while after\nknot B at \u223c 7\u2032\u2032 from the core the X-rays start to fade,\nthe radio emission picks up, peaking at \u223c 10\u2032\u2032 from the\nnucleus. A similar situation occurs for 1510\u2212089, where\nthe jet morphology is rather similar at radio and X-rays in\nthe inner parts while the radio-to-X-ray flux density ratio\nincreases dramatically after 8\u2032\u2032 . 3C 273 is another example\nof this morphology (Sambruna et al. 2001).\nIn 1040+123, 1741+279, and 2251+134, the X-ray knots\n<\nare not resolved as they are located at \u223c 1\u2032\u2032 from the\nstrong core, and we can not comment on these jets morphology. Higher-resolution X-ray observations are needed\nto study these jets.\nX-rays versus optical: As discussed above, seven jets\nhave detections at both X-rays and optical, while two have\nonly optical counterparts. For most of the optical/X-ray\njets, optical emission is confined within 3\u20134\u2032\u2032 from the nucleus, while X-ray emission extends to larger distances.\n\n\f7\nThis may be due to the broader \u03b1ro distribution where a\ndetection would require a deeper HST observation. Because of the many non-detections we cannot distinguish\nbetween a steep \u03b1ro (too steep for the short HST exposure) and a true lack of optical emission from the jet. The\nthree exceptions are 1040+123, 1136\u2212135, and 1150+497,\nwhere the optical jet is as long as (1150+497) or longer\nthen (1040+123, 1136\u2212135) the X-ray jet.\nRecent Chandra studies showed that X-ray emission\nfrom FRI jets may be common (e.g., Worrall et al. 2001).\nIn the only FRI source of our sample, 0836+299, weak Xray excess counts over the background are detected in the\nACIS image in correspondence to the inner radio jet at \u223c\n2\u2032\u2032 (Figure 1), well inside the optical galaxy. However, a\nsimilar X-ray feature is also present at opposite azimuth,\nraising the possibility that the X-ray emission from the radio feature is spurious. No optical counterpart is detected\nin our HST image, after subtracting the host galaxy.\n4.3. Continuous Intra-knot X-ray Emission\nInterestingly, in a few cases there is continuous, weak\nintra-knot X-ray emission. A clear example is 0605\u2212085,\nwhere the inner jet between knots A and B shows smooth\nX-ray emission, with no apparent compact knots. Other\ncandidates for continuous intra-knot X-ray emission are\n0838+133 and 1136\u2212135; however, in 1136\u2212135 the optical knots are compact. While the limited ACIS resolution may conspire to produce diffuse emission where many\nsmall compact knots are instead present (or smearing out\nthe photons from nearby strong knots), in 0605\u2212085 the\nextension of the continuous X-ray emission is at least 2\u2032\u2032 ,\nlarger than the S3 FWHM resolution, and so it is significant in this source. A brief discussion of the possible origin\nof the intraknot X-ray emission in given below (\u00a7 5.1).\nEmission from the inner jet was also detected in PKS\n0637\u2212752 in a 100-ks ACIS-S exposure (Chartas et al.\n2000), with a different spectrum than the external part of\nthe jet, and in 3C 273 in the inner 10\u2032\u2032 (Marshall et al.\n2001). In the latter object, the inner radio/X-ray jet was\nrecently detected in the optical band with the ACS camera\non HST (Martel et al. 2003).\n4.4. Spectral Energy Distributions\nThe Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) of the radiation emitted by the detected features provide basic information on the emission mechanisms. We caution, however,\nthat the derived flux densities refer mainly to unresolved\nsources, thus the size of the emission region is uncertain, at\nleast at X-rays. In the optical, most of the knots are unresolved even at the HST resolution (0.2\u2032\u2032 ; Urry et al. 2004),\nand we will use an upper limit to the source size in the\nmodeling (see below). For consistency, we extracted flux\ndensities at the three wavelengths from the same spatial\nregion around the knot. Since the X-rays have the lowest\nresolution, the aperture of the extraction region was fixed\nat 1\u2032\u2032 or 1.5\u2032\u2032 . The extraction region was centered on the\nposition of the X-ray knot, or of the optical one when no\nX-ray feature was detected.\nFollowing Paper I, radio fluxes for those features well\nseparated from the nucleus were extracted from the same\naperture as the X-ray flux (see section 3.1). The optical\nfluxes were extracted as described in \u00a7 3.2. The unab-\n\nsorbed X-ray flux at 1 keV was derived from the fit to the\nACIS spectrum of the knot, when available (Table 2a),\nor using a power law with average X-ray photon index,\nh\u0393knots i = 1.52. The optical fluxes are corrected for Galactic extinction. Intrinsic reddening, impossible to estimate\nwith the data in hand, is highly unlikely as the line of sight\nis close to the jet axis and the resolved knots are at large\ndistances from the nucleus.\nThe optical flux plays a critical role in the interpretation\nof the SED. Specifically, if the optical emission lies on the\nextrapolation between the radio and X-ray fluxes or above\nit, the SED is compatible with a single electron spectrum\nextending to high energies; instead, if the optical emission\nfalls well below the extrapolation, it argues for different\nspectral components (and therefore different mechanisms\nor two electron populations) below and above the optical\nrange (e.g., synchrotron and IC respectively). Thus, an\nup-turn of the spectrum in the X-ray band with respect to\nthe radio-optical extrapolation, yielding an optical-to-Xray index \u03b1ox flatter than the radio-to-optical index \u03b1ro ,\nis a signature of a separate spectral component in the Xray band. Conversely, when synchrotron dominates we\n<\n\u03b1ox , with the inequality holding when raexpect \u03b1ro \u223c\ndiative losses are important in the X-ray band.\nTable 5a-b lists the radio, optical, and X-ray flux densities, or upper limits to them, for the jet knots, while Table\n6a-b lists the same for the lobes. Also listed in both Tables\nare the broad-band indices \u03b1ro , \u03b1ox , and \u03b1rx , defined as\nthe spectral indices between 5 GHz and 5852 \u00c5, 5852 \u00c5\nand 1 keV, and 5 GHz and 1 keV, respectively.\nFigure 4 shows the plot of \u03b1ro versus \u03b1ox for all the\njet features for which a firm detection at either optical\nor X-rays is available. The dotted line, corresponding to\n\u03b1ro = \u03b1ox , separates the SEDs of the various features between concave (left) and convex (right). In the large majority of the jet knots, X-rays are not an extension of the\nradio-to-optical synchrotron spectrum; the X-ray flux lies\nabove the extrapolation from the radio-to-optical slope.\nSimilarly, most hotspots have concave SEDs.\nFigure 5 shows the relative variation of the X-ray-toradio flux ratios along the jet. In the Figure, \u03b1rx is plotted\nvs. the projected distance of the knots from the core. The\nuncertainties on \u03b1rx are listed in Table 5. Remarkably,\na trend is present in each jet of decreasing X-ray-to-radio\nflux (increasing \u03b1rx ) from the innermost to the outermost\nregions of the jet. Note that the trend is present at large\ndistances from the core, where contamination of the X-ray\nflux from the PSF wings is negligible. A similar but less\nrobust trend of decreasing optical-to-radio flux appears in\nFigure 6, where \u03b1ro is plotted versus the projected distance. We will comment on these trends in \u00a7 5.3.\n5. origin of the x-ray emission\n\n5.1. Clues to the X-ray emission mechanism\nAs seen in Figure 1, the detected jets exhibit a variety\nof multiwavelength morphologies. In a sense, each jet appears to be unique in its detailed properties and deserves a\ndetailed individual study. In fact, we have already secured\ndeeper follow-up observations in Chandra AO4 and multicolor HST ACS exposures of 1136\u2212135 and 1150+497.\nGeneral clues to the origin of the X-ray emission can be\noffered by the study of multiwavelength SEDs for the dif-\n\n\f8\nferent emission features along the jet. It is well established\nthat the radio emission is due to the synchrotron mechanism. Thus, the simplest hypothesis to be considered is\nwhether the optical and X-ray emission could be due to\nsynchrotron emission from the same electron distribution\n(in a simple, zero-order approximation). In that case one\nwould expect the radiated spectrum to follow a power law\nor to steepen at higher energies due to radiation losses.\nFrom the plot of \u03b1ro versus \u03b1ox (Figure 4) it appears that\nthis may be true for at most two cases which fall close to\nthe line for which \u03b1ro = \u03b1ox . One of them corresponds\nto knot A in the jet of 1136\u2212135, the other to knot A of\n1928+738. However, the vast majority of knots lie in the\nregion \u03b1ro > \u03b1ox , showing X-ray emission in excess of the\nextrapolation from lower energies.\nIn order to explain the excess X-ray radiation via the\nsynchrotron mechanism, it is necessary to invoke an extra component in the population of relativistic electrons\n(e.g., Wilson & Yang 2002). A particularly elegant possibility was proposed by Dermer & Atoyan (2002), whereby\nrelativistic electrons are continuously injected and subject\nto radiative losses dominated by inverse-Compton cooling. However, due to the Klein-Nishina suppression of\nthe Compton cooling rate, high-energy electrons suffer less\ncooling compared to low-energy ones, naturally developing\na high-energy excess in the spectrum. In this hypothesis\nthe observed X-rays would be produced by very-high energy electrons.\nAlternatively, in a synchrotron plus inverse Compton\n(IC) scenario, a single power-law electron population can\nbe responsible for emitting the radio via synchrotron and\nthe X-rays via IC, any external seed photon field being\namplified if the jet is still relativistic on the relevant scale.\nNote that these knots occur predominantly at large distances from the core. As the jets are very long (projected\nlengths \u223c 50\u2013100 kpc, intrinsic lengths possibly 2-3 times\nlonger, perhaps 10 times longer) and extend outside the\nhost galaxy, the most likely source of seed photons for IC\nis provided by the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\nphotons (Tavecchio et al. 2000), whose energy density\nscales as (1 + z)4 . For plausible values of the Doppler\nfactor and the magnetic field (\u03b4 \u223c 10, B \u223c 10\u03bcG), the energy of the electrons radiating via synchrotron in the radio\nand via IC in the X-rays is expected to be relatively close\n(\u03b3r = 1000, \u03b3X = 100), hence a similar jet morphology\nat both wavelengths is natural, as observed in most knots.\nX-rays from these features are therefore likely explained\nby the IC/CMB model, on both spectral and morphological grounds. However, starlight photons can be important\nfor knots within the galaxy, within a few tens of kpc of the\ncore (estimated in a similar way to Stawarz, Sikora, & Ostrowski 2003). These photons would be upscattered in the\nX-ray band by very low-energy electrons, \u03b3 \u223c 2. Due to\nthe limited ACIS resolution, emission from the innermost\nknots cannot be easily quantified.\nA discriminant between synchrotron and IC origin for\nthe X-ray emission is the particle radiative lifetime. One\nwould expect shorter radiative lifetimes, and thus more\ncompact emission regions, at the shorter wavelengths in\nthe synchrotron model, whereby X-rays derive from highenergy electrons. The morphology of the 1136\u2013135 jet suggests synchrotron is important in at least some knots. This\n\nis supported by the radio-to-X-ray spectral energy distribution of knot A in 1136\u2212135, which indeed does not show\nan X-ray excess and was fitted by synchrotron emission in\nPaper I.\nA direct consequence of the IC/CMB model is that Xrays are produced by low-energy electrons, characterized\nby an extremely large cooling timescale. Since the electrons can not cool within the short distance of a knot, we\nexpect continuous X-ray emission due to their streaming\nalong the jet. Indeed, in a few cases intraknot emission\nis visible in our Chandra images (\u00a7 4.3). Therefore, it is\npossible to accommodate the knotty morphology with the\nvirtually infinite cooling time of X-ray electrons, assuming\nthat knots just represent local enhancement of the surface\nbrightness, as expected in a shock compression scenario.\nDue to the limited sensitivity of our data, we can not draw\nfirm conclusion. As discussed in Tavecchio, Ghisellini, &\nCelotti (2003), the presence of isolated knots would represent a severe problem for the simplest version of the\nIC/CMB model. A possible way out would be to postulate\nthat the low-energy electrons are cooled through adiabatic\nlosses, effective only if the source can expand enough to\ncool electrons from \u03b3 \u223c 100 to \u03b3 \u223c 10. These considerations lead Tavecchio et al. (2003) to propose that the\nemission from a \"knot\" is instead due to a large number\nof unresolved expanding \"clumps\". Deeper observations at\nhigher resolution are needed to further investigate possible\nknot substructures.\n5.2. Reproducing the SEDs\nTo investigate quantitatively the jet physical properties\nwithin the simple homogeneous synchrotron + IC/CMB\nmodel, we modeled the SEDs of the knots which were\ndetected at both optical and X-rays. Clearly, with only\nthree measured fluxes the models are underconstrained.\nHowever, in the cases where X-rays can be attributed to\nIC/CMB the model parameters can be fixed if the equipartition assumption is adopted.\nA significant uncertainty of present observations concerns the size of the emitting region(s). In what follows,\nwe assume that the emitting region is consistent at the\nthree wavelengths examined and adopt a region size of 1\u2032\u2032\nradius, corresponding to the X-ray resolution and the area\nfrom which fluxes were extracted.\nWe refer to Tavecchio et al. (2000) and Paper I for a\nfull description of the model. Briefly, the emitting region\nis assumed to be spherical with radius R and in motion\nwith a bulk Lorentz factor \u0393 at an angle \u03b8 with respect to\nthe line of sight. Since fluxes are extracted within a circle\nof radius 1\u2032\u2032 , we fix the dimension R (in cm) corresponding\nto this angular size. Note that this is different than Paper I, where for simplicity we considered a unique value of\nradius for all the sources. The emitting region is homogeneously filled by high-energy electrons, with a power-law\nenergy distribution N (\u03b3) = K\u03b3 \u2212n extending from \u03b3min to\n\u03b3max . Electrons emit radiation through synchrotron and\nIC/CMB mechanisms. The low-energy limit of the electron distribution \u03b3min is well constrained by the condition\nthat the low-energy part of the IC/CMB component cannot overproduce the observed optical flux. Note that the\noptical emission in many cases could be attributed either\nto the high-energy tail of the synchrotron component (in\n\n\f9\nthis case the optical spectrum is expected to be soft) or to\nthe low-energy tail of the IC/CMB component (hard optical spectrum expected). The X-ray spectra of the knots\nin Table 2a are relatively flat in all the cases where the\nSEDs are consistent with IC/CMB, as expected (e.g., Fig.\n8 in Paper I). The parameters of the best-fit models are\nreported in Table 7. Figure 7 shows representative SEDs\nfor two sources where at least two knots were detected at\nX-rays and optical in the same jet, with the best-fit models\nsuperposed.\nFor two cases, namely knots A in 1136\u2212135 and\n1928+738, the optical-radio-X-ray fluxes are consistent\nwith one component, indicating the X-rays are produced\nvia synchrotron. Therefore, in these cases we have reproduced the observed fluxes imposing that the IC/CMB\ncomponent does not substantially contribute to the X-ray\nflux: This provides a lower limit on the Doppler factor,\nthat translates into a limit on the bulk Lorentz factor and\non the observing angle reported in Table 7. The kinetic\nand radiative powers derived with the parameters reported\nin Table 7 confirm the evidence (see also Paper I) that only\n<\na small fraction ( \u223c 0.1%) of the jet kinetic power is dissipated into radiation.\nSince our choice of the size of the emitting region based\non the Chandra resolution is rather restrictive, we checked\nthe sensitivity of the derived parameters on the assumed\nvolume. Since we know from the optical images that the\n(optical) knots are unresolved down to \u223c 0.2\u2032\u2032 , we performed a series of fits assuming a cylindrical region with\nheight 2\u2032\u2032 (along the jet direction) and radius 0.2\u2032\u2032 . The\nresults of this new set of fits show that the derived parameters are not strongly affected by this change in volume: in\nparticular \u03b4 is slighly larger (about a factor 1.5) and similarly the magnetic field and the electron density change\nwithin a factor of 3\u20134.\n5.3. Trends of the emission along the jet\nIf emission from single knots seems to be well reproduced by the IC/CMB model, further interesting clues to\nthe origin of the high-energy emission and to the global\ndynamics of the jet originate from examination the overall\ntrends of the SEDs for different knots along the same jet.\nThese were presented in Figures 5 and 6, which show the\nplots of \u03b1rx and \u03b1ro versus the projected distance of the\nknots from the cores. As discussed in \u00a7 4.4, the X-rayto-radio and optical-to-radio flux ratio decreases along the\njets.\nThe trends in the two plots suggest that a common\nevolution of the conditions along the jet determines the\nobserved properties of the emission features. In a pure\n\"synchrotron+IC/CMB\" model, the relative strength of\nthe X-ray and radio emission, which to first order is given\nby the ratio of the CMB and magnetic densities, is expected to increase, since the magnetic field within the jet\npresumably decreases and the energy density of the CMB\nis constant. The observed opposite behaviors could have\ndifferent origins:\n\u2022 It could be due to the synchrotron mechanism extending to the X-ray band in the inner knots (due to\na higher value of the magnetic field and/or the particle energies), thus providing an additional X-ray\n\ncomponent which progressively disappears in the\nmore external knots. This scenario is supported by\nthe case of 1136\u2013135, where a synchrotron emitting\ninner knot is resolved with ACIS. This interpretation is also supported by the case of 3C 273, where\nthe X-ray emission from the first knot is possibly\nsynchrotron (Marshall et al. 2001). The preliminary analysis of our deeper Chandra and multicolor\nHST exposures of 1150+497 and 1136\u2013135 also confirm this interpretation.\n\u2022 An additional component of IC emission could be\nprovided in the innermost knots by the interstellar light photons whose energy density within the\ngalaxy can prevail over the CMB density (e.g.\nStawarz et al. 2003). Along the jet this contribution will decrease, producing the observed trend\nof the X-ray-to-radio flux ratio.\n\u2022 In a pure IC/CMB scenario, the trend could be\nattributed to decelerating plasma: the decreasing\nvalue of \u0393 translates into a less amplified CMB radiation and thus a lower X-ray flux compared to\nthe radio flux. Elements supporting this view are\nprovided by our modeling of the jet of 1354+195,\nfor which two distinct knots were analyzed (see Table 7). The data require that the bulk Lorentz factor between the two features decrease by a factor\nof 2, from \u0393 = 14 (knot A) to \u0393 = 6 (knot B). At\nthe same time the magnetic field strength and the\nnumber of particles increase. (However, remember\nthat we are assuming equipartition, so the magnetic\nenergy density and the electron energy density are\nlinked.)\nThe trend observed in the \u03b1ro profiles can simply be\nrelated to the decreasing value of the maximum Lorentz\nfactor of the emitting electrons. This will produce a shift\nof the synchrotron cutoff toward lower frequencies along\nthe jet and therefore a decreasing optical flux along the\njet (note that the same beavior can be mimicked by a decrease of the magnetic field). A better understanding of\nthese and other systematic trends requires more sophisticated theoretical studies than is possible to include here.\n5.4. Caveats\nIt is worth remarking a few caveats affecting our analysis. First, the limited signal-to-noise ratio at both X-ray\nand optical wavelengths leaves room for alternative interpretations of the SEDs. Second, as already mentioned\nabove, a variety of physical conditions may exist within the\nrelatively large extraction regions we used (1\u2032\u2032 , dictated by\nthe Chandra resolution), for example the emitting particle distributions could be stratified or multiple shocks may\nexist. While higher angular resolution at X-rays awaits future generations of space-based telescopes, deeper followup X-ray and optical observations of the new jets of this\nsurvey with Chandra and HST can at least remedy the first\nlimitation of our analysis, in providing accurate X-ray and\noptical continuum spectra for individual knots, a key test\nfor the emission models.\nHigh-quality X-ray and optical spectra of single knots\nwill be essential to discriminate among the various mod-\n\n\f10\nels, as well as more detailed maps to measure and quantify the positional offsets of the radio, optical, and X-ray\npeaks. Optical observations are necessary to identify the\nmechanism responsible for the X-ray emission, as the optical band lies at the intersection of the synchrotron and\nIC components. We have already taken steps to acquire\nfollow-up observations of selected jets during the Cycle\n4 Chandra-HST cycle. Finally, an additional important\nconstraint will be provided by future IR observations with\nSIRTF, probing a poorly known region in the SEDs where\nthe synchrotron peak (related to the break energy of the\nsynchrotron electron population) is located. Of particular\ninterest will be SIRTF observations of the jets not detected\nat optical wavelengths, to determine whether this can be\ndue to a lower cutoff energy of the electron distribution.\n5.5. Comparison with FRI Jets\nChandra has detected X-ray emission in a handful of\nlow-power FRI sources (Worrall et al. 2001, Hardcastle et\nal. 2002, 2001). It is interesting to compare their properties to the FRII jets of our sample.\nIn most FRI jets, the X-ray flux of the detected knots\nlies on the extrapolation of the radio-to-optical emission.\nThe favored interpretation is that the X-rays are due to\nsynchrotron emission from the same population of electrons responsible for the radio and optical fluxes. The Xray spectrum of the knot, when available, is also consistent\nwith the low-energy emission, confirming this interpretation. The radio/X-ray morphology of the jet is remarkably\nsimilar in all FRIs. In all cases, the X-ray profile of the\nfirst detected knot peaks before the radio, yielding a larger\nX-ray-to-radio flux ratio, or flatter \u03b1rx , than in the knots\nfurther away along the jet. A similar situation occurs for\nsources close to the FRI/II transition (e.g., 3C 371, Pesce\net al. 2001; PKS 0521\u2013365, Birkinshaw et al. 2002).\nThus, the X-ray emission from kpc-scale jets in FRIs and\nFRIIs appears to be due to different processes, with synchrotron dominating in low-power sources and IC/CMB in\nhigh-power sources. However, a closer look to our targets\nreveals that the FRI/II division of jet emitting mechanisms\nmay not be sharp. Indeed, as discussed above, the inner\nparts of the powerful FRII jets may be dominated by different production mechanisms for the X-rays, suggesting a\nchange of conditions along the jet. A clear example from\nour survey is 1136\u2212135. In this case, X-rays from the innermost knot A (\u223c 5\u2032\u2032 , or 25 kpc) are due to synchrotron\nemission of high-energy electrons in the jet, while X-rays\nfrom external knot B are consistent with IC/CMB (Table 7). Strong particle acceleration is necessary to explain\nsynchrotron X-rays in the inner parts of the jet.\nA possibility to account for the FRI/II dichotomy on\nlarge-scales is proposed in our companion paper (Tavecchio et al. 2004). We suggest that the main difference\nbetween FRI and FRII jets is the location at which the jet\npressure becomes comparable to the ambient gas pressure\nand the jet starts to slow down significantly, giving rise to\nshocks. Assuming that both FRI and FRII host galaxies\nhave similar gas halos (e.g., Gambill et al. 2003), the discriminating parameter becomes the jet pressure which is\nrelated to the jet power (Maraschi & Tavecchio 2003): the\nmore luminous sources (FRIIs) are slowed down later than\nless luminous ones. If this is true, one expects to observe\n\nthe sites where dissipation is taking place - the innermost\nknots - closer to the core in lower-luminosity sources than\nin the more powerful ones.\nTo illustrate this point, we plot in Figure 8 the total\nradio power of the sources versus the deprojected distance\nof the first detected knot (optical or X-ray). The total radio powers were derived from Cheung et al. (2004), Liu &\nXie (1992), and Liu & Zhang (2002). Only the sources for\nwhich an estimate of the angle from modeling is available\n(Table 7) were used. In addition, we plot the same quantities for a few low-power radio galaxies from the literature\nfor which enough information is available (3C 371, Pesce\net al. 2001; M87, Wilson & Yang 2002; 3C 31, 3C 66B,\nHardcastle et al. 2002, 2001; and NGC 315, Worrall et\nal. 2003). The only FRI of our sample, 0836+299, is\nalso plotted (triangle). As apparent from Figure 8, lowand high-power sources occupy distinct regions, with the\nFRIIs having the first detected knots at larger distances\nfrom the nucleus than lower-luminosity sources. A trend\nis also present within the FRII class itself.\nWe note, however, that the FRIIs in the Figure are at\nlarger redshifts than FRIs. The loss in resolution thus\ncould be introducing a bias, i.e., we are not resolving the\ninnermost knots in the most distant FRIIs. In fact, in\n3C 273 (z=0.158) optical knots very close (2.7\u2032\u2032 , or projected distance of 7 kpc) to the nucleus were recently detected with the ACS camera on HST (Martel et al. 2003).\nClearly, high-resolution sensitive observations of the inner\njets in FRIIs are needed to confirm the suggestion of Figure\n8. Moreover, the deprojected jet length clearly depends on\nthe assumed (hence model-dependent) value of the viewing\nangle. In this respect, the choice of the IC/CMB model\nfor the high-power datapoints in Figure 8 could introduce\na bias toward small angles and therefore large deprojected\nlengths. However, other (almost model-independent) indicators such as the core dominance parameter Ri and the\njet-to-counter jet ratio J (Table 1), suggest small observing angles. Based on these considerations, we are confident\nthat the large deprojected lengths in Figure 8, albeit affected by inevitable uncertainties, are reliable.\nAlthough the scenario depicted above can explain some\nof the basic differences between FRIs and FRII, the study\nof the nearest FRI, M87, shows that the situation may be\nmore complex. In this object the X-ray flux belongs to a\nseparate component than the longer wavelength flux. The\nsteep X-ray spectrum suggests synchrotron emission from\na separate population of particles (Wilson & Yang 2002),\nindicating jet inhomogeneities. Moreover, we recall that\nthere are also indications that the jet can have a velocity\nstructure, with a fast spine surrounded by a slower moving layer (as originally proposed by Laing et al. 1993).\nSynchrotron emission would be produced in the walls of\nthe jet, while IC/CMB would predominate in the beamed\nemission concentrated in the spine.\n6. summary and conclusions\n\nWe presented short Chandra and HST observations of\na sample of 17 radio jets. One goal of the survey was\nto establish in a systematic way the relation between Xray/optical and radio emission from extragalactic jets.\nThe survey was therefore designed to provide at least a\ndetection in X-rays for a radio-to-X-ray spectral index\n\n\f11\n\u03b1rx = 0.8, and in the optical for \u03b1ro = 0.8. The short exposures were designed to search for the X-ray and optical\ncounterparts of the radio jets, and start addressing their\nphysical properties through multiwavelength imaging.\nWe detect X-ray emitting knots in 10/17 (59%) jets,\nwith a similar detection rate for the optical features. This\nis actually a lower limit to the number of X-ray emitting\nknots, as several radio- and optically-detected features are\n<\ntoo close to the core ( \u223c 1\u20132\u2032\u2032 ) to be clearly resolved with\nACIS. Moreover, as discussed above, the non-detections\nare most likely related to incompleteness rather than \u03b1rx\nindices steeper than expected (Figures 3a). We can thus\nconclude that X-ray emission from extended radio jets with\n\u03b1rx \u223c 0.8 is common in AGN, and it is consistent with\nbeing a characteristic of essentially all bright radio jets.\nThe rate of detection in Table 2a is similar for FSRQs\nand SSRQs, \u223c 60%. The presence of a large number of\nFSRQs in the sample (Table 1) is a direct indication that\nour sample is biased towards beamed objects. Thus, the\ndetection rates for jets refer to lines of sight close to the\njet axis at both X-rays and optical. This is in agreement\nwith previous optical studies (Parma et al. 2003, Sparks\net al. 1995), which concluded that jet optical emission is\npreferentially detected in those sources with larger beaming, i.e., where the jet is closer to the line of sight. In\nfact, the two jets in our sample with the lowest values of\nthe core-to-total radio power, 0802+103 (Ri \u223c 0.03) and\n0836+299 (Ri \u223c 0.06), are not detected at either optical\nor X-rays.\nIn our sample, there is no obvious dependence of the detection rates on redshift. The most distant jet (0802+103\nat z=1.96) is not detected at X-rays or optical, however,\nthis source has a lesser defined radio jet (Figure 1) and is\nthe most lobe-dominated source in the sample. The second most distant, 1040+123 at z=1.03, is well-detected at\noptical wavelengths but only upper limits are present at\nX-rays. The third most distant, 1055+018 at z=0.88, is\nnot detected. A larger, systematic sample of high-redshift\nsources with well-defined radio data is needed to confirm\nthe suggestion (Schwartz 2002) that X-ray emission is common at cosmological redshifts as a result of an increased\nCMB density.\nIn summary, the main results of our paper are:\n\u2022 X-ray and optical emission is detected in \u223c 60% of\nthe jets, with h\u03b1ro i \u223c 1.0 and h\u03b1rx i \u223c 0.8.\n\u2022 The non-detections in the X-rays are due to incompleteness rather than \u03b1rx indices steeper than expected, meaning essentially all radio jets have X-ray\nemission at some intensity level. The observed distribution of \u03b1ro indices is consistent with steeper\nvalues than assumed.\n\u2022 In most knots the X-ray flux lies above the extrapolation of the radio-to-optical continuum, indicating\na separate spectral component.\n\u2022 Interpreting the X-ray emission of these knots as\ndue to inverse Compton scattering off the CMB\nphotons, yields relativistic jets on kpc scales, with\nplasma Lorentz factors \u0393jet \u223c 3 \u2212 15, and very low\n(< 0.1%) radiative efficiencies.\n\n\u2022 In a few knots the X-ray flux lies below or on the extrapolation of the radio-to-optical continuum. Here\nthe X-rays are likely to be due to synchrotron emission from the same population of relativistic particles responsible for the longer wavelengths.\n\u2022 Spectral changes along the jets are observed, with\nthe X-ray-to-radio and optical-to-radio flux ratios\ndecreasing from the inner to the outer regions.\n\u2022 The trend of decreasing X-ray-to-radio flux ratios\ncan be either the results of 1) an additional X-ray\nproducing process in the inner jet (synchrotron or\ninverse Compton scattering of starlight), or 2) in\nthe IC/CMB scenario, decelerating plasma. The\ntrend in \u03b1ro could simply be due to a decrease of\nthe electrons Lorentz factor along the jet.\nSeveral questions remain open. Most fundamental one\nis the origin of the bright X-ray emission from kpc-scale\njets. As discussed above, the IC/CMB process appears\nto account satisfactorily for the flat optical-to-X-ray spectral indices of most knots, at least in the external part\nof the jets, but implies the presence of relativistic bulk\nmotion at large distances from the core. This is in contrast with radio studies showing only modest bulk velocities at such distances (e.g., Wardle & Aaron 1997), but is\nconsistent with jet one-sidedness and with depolarization\nasymmetries (Garrington et al. 1988). Additional contributions to the X-ray emission may be present along the jet,\ne.g., IC of the host galaxy starlight, which could account\nfor the decreasing X-ray-to-radio flux ratios along the jet\n(see above). Possible inhomogeneities in the jet (multiple\nshocks or particle distributions) in space or/and time are\nadditional complicating factors.\nIn some FRII jets we observe \"mixed\" emission with\nsynchrotron dominating in the inner parts of the jet (e.g.,\n1136\u2013135, 3C 273). The rate of occurrence of this is still\nunclear, as is its physical origin.\nFinally, we note that the X-ray spectral indices measured in the large majority of the jets knots are flat,\n\u03b1X \u223c 0.5, indicating that most of the jet luminosity is\nemitted at \u03b3-rays. This raises the interesting possibility\nof future GLAST detections. Given that radio jets might\nbe bright at large redshifts (Schwartz 2002), it would not\nbe surprising if extended jets would be found to be significant contributors to the \u03b3-ray background. While GLAST\nlacks sufficient angular resolution to separate the kpc-scale\njet from the bright core, variability studies could conceivably be used to discriminate the origin of the gamma-ray\nemission.\nThe referee, Dan Harris, provided constructive criticism which helped improving the manuscript.

The lowest contour is 0.5 mJy/beam.\nOnly the hotspot of the northern lobe was detected at Xrays and optical. The X-ray/optical feature coincides well\nwith the radio one, with no centroid offset.\n0605\u2212085: The VLA contours in Figure 1 were restored with beamsize 0.45\u2032\u2032 . The lowest contour is 0.75\nmJy/beam. Two X-ray knots were detected, with no optical counterpart in the HST image, as well as faint intraknot emission. The X-ray emission peaks 4.0\u2032\u2032 (B), before\nthe radio knot which peaks at 4.5\u2032\u2032 . This radio knot is\ncentered with a difference of position angle, \u2206PA=18\u25e6 ,\nfurther south. The nearby bright source on the S-W is a\nforeground star, with a bright optical counterpart on the\nHST map.\n0723+679: The VLA contours in Figure 1 were restored\nwith beamsize 0.5\u2032\u2032 . The lowest contour is 0.09 mJy/beam.\nThe radio images were reprocessed from calibrated data\npublished in Owen & Puschell (1984). Knots C and D at\n4.4\u2032\u2032 and 6.6\u2032\u2032 , respectively, were already reported in Paper I (as A and B). Analysis of the HST image, showing\nan optical knot at 0.9\u2032\u2032 (knot A), prompted a reanalysis of\nthe inner jet in the ACIS image. Following the method described above, knot A is detected at X-rays, although it is\nnot resolved. As contamination from the PSF wings could\naffect out measurement, we list the measured counts as an\nupper limit (Table 3a). An additional knot is detected at\n2\u2032\u2032 from the core (knot B in Table 2). Weak, diffuse X-ray\nemission from the counterlobe is also present (Table 3).\n0802+103: The VLA contours in Figure 1 were restored\nwith beamsize 0.3\u2032\u2032 . The lowest contour is 0.2 mJy/beam.\nWeak, fuzzy X-ray emission, generally elongated in the\nsame direction as the South radio jet, is present in Figure\n1. The enhanced X-ray counts correspond to the edge of\nthe jet. It is unclear whether this X-ray counts are associated to the jet or represent a background fluctuation or\nbackground source. Some diffuse X-ray emission is also\npresent in the N counterlobe, again with no clear correspondence to the radio. We report upper limits to both\nX-ray structures in Table 3.\n0836+299: The VLA contours in Figure 1 were restored with beamsize 0.86\u2032\u2032 . The lowest contour is 0.08\nmJy/beam. Chandra clearly detects X-ray emission from\nthe hotspots in the S-W radio lobe at 17.8\u2032\u2032 , and in the\ncounterlobe at 11.3\u2032\u2032 . Both hotspots have an optical detection in our HST data. The ACIS map shows a faint\nX-ray structure (A) generally coincident with the inner\nportion of the S-W radio jet (Figure 1), with less than 2\u03c3\nsignificance (Table 3). However, the presence of a nearly\nidentical (same number of counts) feature in the opposite\ndirection makes the X-ray emission from the jet uncertain.\n0838+133: The VLA contours in Figure 1 were restored\nwith beamsize 0.35\u2032\u2032 . The lowest contour is 0.3 mJy/beam.\nX-ray counterparts to three radio knots at 1.4\u2032\u2032 , 4.6\u2032\u2032 , and\n\n6.5\u2032\u2032 are detected in the Chandra image. Knot A at 1.4\u2032\u2032\nalso emits in the optical. Feature C is identified as a\nhotspot. Weak emission from the counterlobe is also confirmed (Brunetti et al. 2002).\n1040+123: The VLA contours in Figure 1 were restored with beamsize 0.25\u2032\u2032 . The lowest contour is 0.65\nmJy/beam. The HST data show optical emission from\nseveral radio knots at 0.9\u2032\u2032 (B), 1.5\u2032\u2032 (C), and 4.8\u2032\u2032 (D). In\nthe Chandra image (Figure 1), knot B is marginally detected, but not resolved given its proximity to the strong\nX-ray core. Fuzzy X-ray emission is visible around the\ncounterlobe, although it may be a background fluctuation\nor foreground sources.\n1055+018: The VLA contours in Figure 1 were restored\nwith beamsize 1.5\u2032\u2032 . The lowest contour is 0.85 mJy/beam.\nThis source was previously studied in Paper I. No X-ray\nor optical jet is detected (Table 3a). Paper I lists an upper\nlimit to the jet.\n1136\u2212135: The VLA contours in Figure 1 were restored\nwith beamsize 0.5\u2032\u2032 . The lowest contour is 0.5 mJy/beam.\nWe confirm the results of Paper I. X-ray emission is detected from two knots at 4.6\u2032\u2032 (A) and 6.7\u2032\u2032 (B) from the\ncore, both of which have an optical counterpart. A third\nknot (C) is detected in the optical at the end of the radio\njet, at 10\u2032\u2032 ; however, no X-ray counterpart is present. Our\nreanalysis of the Chandra image also showed the presence\nof an inner knot, \u03b1 (Table 2), which is confirmed by our\ndeep (80 ks) GO4 exposure. In the radio, knot \u03b1 has a\n4\u03c3 detection in our 5 GHz VLA image at 0.4 mJy, though\nit is not obvious in Figure 1. It was detected similarly in\nour unpublished deep 22 GHz VLA image. The jet X-ray\nemission peaks at knot B while the radio peaks at knot\nC, at the end of the jet. Possible intraknot faint X-ray\nemission is present.\n1150+497: The VLA contours in Figure 1 were restored\nwith beamsize 0.5\u2032\u2032 . The lowest contour is 0.25 mJy/beam.\nThe radio images were reprocessed from calibrated data\npublished in Owen & Puschell (1984). The knots nomenclature changed from Paper I, following the detection of\nseveral more optical counterparts in the HST data. The\ninnermost optical knot A at 0.9\u2032\u2032 is not resolved at X-rays\nand we can only give an upper limit in Table 3a. Detected\nX-ray knot B at 2.2\u2032\u2032 (Table 2) correponds to the sum of\ntwo optical knots at 2.1\u2032\u2032 and 2.6\u2032\u2032 . The X-ray detection\nof the hotspot in the Southern lobe (H in Table 2) is resolved in the optical into two distinct components, one at\n8.3\u2032\u2032 and one at 8.5\u2032\u2032 . Note the \"corkscrew\" structure of\nthis jet, reminiscent of 3C 273.\n1354+195: The VLA contours in Figure 1 were restored\nwith beamsize 1\u2032\u2032 . The lowest contour is 0.6 mJy/beam.\nOur analysis is consistent with Paper I. However, due to\nthe criteria for detection adopted here, a few faint X-ray\nknots that were considered detections in Paper I now do\nnot meet the detection criteria defined above, and are instead listed in Table 3a (knots C, D, E, H). Solid detections\nat 2\u03c3 or more were obtained for the remaining knots A,\nB, F, G, and the hotspot I in the Southern lobe. Optical\ncounterparts are present only for the two innermost knots\nA and B. This is the longest (28\u2032\u2032 in projected size) and\nnarrowest jet of the sample.\n1510\u2212089: The VLA contours in Figure 1 were restored\nwith beamsize 0.4\u2032\u2032 . The lowest contour is 0.45 mJy/beam.\n\n\f13\nThree X-ray knots are detected (Table 2), with no optical\ncounterparts. This jet has an interesting morphology. The\ninner part up to knot B follows the radio closely, with an\nalmost one-to-one correspondence. After knot B, the jet\nwidens at both X-rays and radio, and there is no clear correspondence between the two wavelengths. The X-ray jet\nis shorter than at radio: X-ray emission ends at \u223c 5\u2032\u2032 from\nthe core, while the radio continues up to \u223c 10\u2032\u2032 , bending\nslightly to the West.\n1641+399: The VLA contours in Figure 1 were restored\nwith beamsize 0.45\u2032\u2032 . The lowest contour is 4.0 mJy/beam.\nThere is only one X-ray knot detected at 2.7\u2032\u2032 N-W from\nthe core, which also has an optical counterpart. The X-ray\njet is shorter than the radio one.\n1642+690: The VLA contours in Figure 1 were restored\nwith beamsize 0.45\u2032\u2032 . The lowest contour is 0.4 mJy/beam.\nX-ray emission is clearly detected in a knot at 2.7\u2032\u2032 from\nthe core, with no optical counterpart. Optical emission\nis instead present from the inner knot at 0.7\u2032\u2032 (Table 3).\nThis is another example of a jet shorter at X-rays than in\n\nthe radio.\n1741+279: The VLA contours in Figure 1 were restored\nwith beamsize 0.4\u2032\u2032 . The lowest contour is 0.15 mJy/beam.\nThis is an unclear case. Inspection of the Chandra map\nshows possible faint emission from the inner jet around\n1.8\u2032\u2032 , roughly at the center of the elongated radio feature.\nHowever, a similar feature is present at the opposite azimuth. There is a very weak detection of the N hotspot\nwhich we list in Table 3b.\n1928+738: The VLA contours in Figure 1, taken at 1.4\nGHz, were restored with beamsize 1.5\u2032\u2032 . The lowest contour is 0.75 mJy/beam. Only one X-ray knot is detected at\n2.6\u2032\u2032 from the nucleus, which also has an optical counterpart. This is also the only well-defined radio feature, after\nwhich the radio jet widens into a poorly confined lobe.\n2251+134: The VLA contours in Figure 1 were restored with beamsize 0.45\u2032\u2032 . The lowest contour is 0.95\nmJy/beam. Our HST image shows optical emission from\nthree knots at 1.1\u2032\u2032 (A), 2.3\u2032\u2032 , and 2.8\u2032\u2032 . We list an upper\nlimit to the innermost knot, A, in Table 3a.\n\nREFERENCES\nAkujor, C.E. & Garrington, S.T. 1991, MNRAS, 250, 644\nAldcroft, T.L., Elvis, M., & Bechtold, J. 1993, AJ, 105, 2054\nBirkinshaw, M., Worrall, D.

Overlaid are the radio contours from\narchival VLA data. Both the colors and the contours are plotted logarithmically, in steps of factor 2. The Chandra image is smoothed with a\nGaussian of width \u03c3=0.3\u2032\u2032 , yielding a resolution of 0.86\u2032\u2032 FWHM. The radio image was restored with a circular beam (see Appendix). North\nis up and East to the left.\nFig. 2.- Chandra ACIS-S images in the 0.5\u20138 keV energy range of selected jets of our sample, showing the innermost jet regions close to\nthe core.

(a) and\n(b): Distributions of \u03b1rx and \u03b1ro for the jet knots; (c) and (d): Distributions of \u03b1rx and \u03b1ro for the lobes. The dashed histograms represent\ndetections, while the arrows represent lower limits.\n\n\f22\n\nFig. 4.- Plot of the radio-to-optical spectral index, \u03b1ro , versus the optical-to-X-ray index, \u03b1ox . The filled circles are for the jet knots\n(Table 5), while the open circles are for the lobes (Table 6). The squares are for non-detections. The dashed line marks the locus where\n\u03b1ox = \u03b1ro . Knots lying above the dashed line have a concave SED, where the X-rays belong to a different spectral component than the\nlonger wavelengths; IC probably dominates in these sources for the X-ray production. Knots below the dashed line have a convex SED, and\nthe X-rays are interpreted as due to synchrotron emission (see text).\n\n\f23\n\nFig. 5.- Plot of the radio-to-X-ray spectral index for the knots of individual jets (in different symbols) versus the projected distance of\nthe knot from the core. The circles mark the innermost knots where contamination from the PSF wings could be present. The uncertainties\non \u03b1rx are listed in Table 5 and 6. Interestingly, the X-ray-to-radio flux ratio decreases with increasing distance along the jet.\n\n\f24\n\nFig. 6.- Same as for Figure 5, but for the radio-to-optical index.
