Examples include the bathtub vortex,\nvortices resulting from flow past obstacles, wingtip vortices, as well as hurricanes and tornadoes. Vortical flows play\nan essential role in many applications and hence it is no surprise that vortex dynamics is an important sub-topic in\nfluid mechanics. A polynomial is a basic mathematical structure, perhaps the simplest and most fundamental. There\nare many situations where approximations of mathematical functions are made using polynomials, for example in\nnumerical methods. In this paper we are concerned with the relationship between vortex dynamics and the roots of\nsome special polynomials.\nThe point vortex equations may be thought of as a discretization of the equations for two-dimensional flow, the\nEuler equations, which is useful for analytical and numerical approximations. Considering the flow plane of the\ntwo-dimensional fluid to be the complex plane, i.e. the point (x, y) is viewed as the complex number z = x + iy,\none associates a set of point vortices with a polynomial that has roots at the locations of the vortices and uses this\nrepresentation to study the vortex configurations.\nIn two recent papers, Aref [8, 9] reviews the connection between point vortex dynamics and polynomials with\nroots at the positions of the vortices. For stationary vortex configurations the following results have been established:\n1. N identical vortices on a line are in equilibrium if and only if they are situated at the roots of the classical N th\nHermite polynomial, which are related to the Stieltjes relations [50, 51], see equation (3.2);\n2. N identical vortices on a circle are in equilibrium if and only if they are situated at the vertices of a regular\nN -polygon [37];\n3.\n\n1\n2 n(n + 1)\n\npositive and 21 n(n \u2212 1) negative vortices are in equilibrium if and only if they are situated at the roots\nof the Adler\u2013Moser polynomials [10, 12, 32] (see also \u00a72.2 and \u00a73.2.1);\n\n4. N positive and N negative vortices form a uniformly translating equilibrium if and only if the vortices of one\nsign are situated at the roots of an Adler\u2013Moser polynomial and the vortices of opposite sign are then at the roots\nof a polynomial of the same degree derived from the Adler\u2013Moser polynomial [10, 12, 32] (see also \u00a73.2.2).\nFurther, such equilibria are only possible when N is a triangular number.\nAref [8, 9] remarks that the relationship between the theory of stationary equilibria and rational solutions of the\nKorteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation\nut + 6uux + uxxx = 0,\n(1.1)\n1\n\n\fone of the original contexts in which the Adler\u2013Moser polynomials arose, is \"quite unexpected and very beautiful\".\nThere has been considerable interest in completely integrable partial differential equations solvable by inverse\nscattering, the soliton equations, since the discovery in 1967 by Gardner, Greene, Kruskal, and Miura [30] of the\nmethod for solving the initial value problem for the KdV equation (1.1). During the past thirty years or so there\nhave been several studies of rational solutions for the soliton equations, applications of which include the description\nof explode-decay waves [40] and vortex solutions of the complex sine-Gordon equation [11, 46]. Airault, McKean,\nand Moser [7] studied the motion of the poles of rational solutions of the KdV equation (1.1) and related the motion\nto an integrable many-body problem, the Calogero-Moser system with constraints. Subsequently Adler and Moser\n[3] expressed the rational solutions of the KdV equation in terms of the Adler\u2013Moser polynomials (see \u00a72.2 below).\nAblowitz and Satsuma [1] derived rational solutions of the KdV equation (1.1) by finding a long-wave limit of the\nknown N -soliton solutions of these equations.\nThe Painlev\u00e9 equations (PI \u2013PVI ) are six nonlinear ordinary differential equations discovered by Painlev\u00e9, Gambier\nand their colleagues around the beginning of the 20th century. Their solutions define new transcendental functions as\nthey are not expressible in terms of previously known functions such as elementary and elliptic functions or in terms\nof solutions of linear ordinary differential equations and can be thought of as nonlinear analogues of the classical\nspecial functions [19, 28, 31, 52]. It is well known that PII \u2013PVI have rational solutions, algebraic solutions, and\nsolutions expressed in terms of the classical special functions (cf. [19, 31]). Ablowitz and Segur [2] demonstrated a\nclose relationship between the soliton and Painlev\u00e9 equations. For example, the second Painlev\u00e9 equation (PII )\nd2 w\n= 2w3 + zw + \u03b1,\ndz 2\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is an arbitrary constant, arises as a scaling reduction of the KdV equation (1.1) and the fourth Painlev\u00e9\nequation (PIV )\n\u0012\n\u00132\n1 dw\n3\nd2 w\n+ w4 + 4zw3 + 2(z 2 \u2212 \u03b1)w2 + \u03b2,\n(1.3)\nw 2 =\n2 dz\n2\ndz\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are arbitrary constants, arises as scaling reductions of the Boussinesq equation\nutt + (u2 )xx \u00b1 uxxxx = 0,\n\n(1.4)\n\nand the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger (NLS) equation\niqt + qxx \u00b1 2|q|2 q = 0.\n\n(1.5)\n\nVorob'ev and Yablonskii [56, 57] expressed the rational solutions of PII (1.2) in terms of polynomials, now known\nas the Yablonskii\u2013Vorob'ev polynomials (see \u00a72.1 below), which are special cases of the Adler\u2013Moser polynomials.\nOkamoto [45] derived analogous polynomials, now known as the Okamoto polynomials, related to some of the rational solutions of PIV (1.3). Okamoto's results were generalized by Noumi and Yamada [43] who expressed rational\nsolutions of PIV (1.3) in terms of two sets of polynomials, the generalized Hermite polynomials and the generalized\nOkamoto polynomials (see \u00a72.3 below).\nThis paper is organized as follows. In \u00a72 we describe the special polynomials associated with rational solutions of\nthe Painlev\u00e9 and soliton equations. In \u00a73 we discuss several examples of equilibrium vortex configurations for vortices\nof the same strength but positive or negative orientation. In \u00a73.2 stationary vortex configurations and uniformly\ntranslating vortex configurations are shown to be given by the zeros of the Adler\u2013Moser polynomials and related to\neigenstates of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for rational potentials decaying at infinity, which relates to work of Duistermaat\nand Gr\u00fcnbaum [25]. In \u00a73.3, for quadrupole background flow, vortex configurations are shown to be given by the zeros\nof polynomials expressed as wronskians of Hermite polynomials and related to eigenstates of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nfor rational potentials with quadratic growth at infinity which relates to work of Oblomkov [44], Veselov [54], and\nLoutsenko [38]. Further using results on the generalized Hermite and generalized Okamoto polynomials associated\nwith rational solutions of PIV (1.3) it is shown that there are more solutions in the case of quadrupole background flow\nthan might be anticipated from previous work. Finally in \u00a74 we discuss our results.\n\n2 Special polynomials associated with the Painlev\u00e9 and soliton equations\n2.1 The Yablonskii\u2013Vorob'ev polynomials\nRational solutions of PII (1.2), with \u03b1 = n \u2208 Z, can be expressed in terms of special polynomials now known as\nthe Yablonskii\u2013Vorob'ev polynomials, which were introduced by Vorob'ev [56] and Yablonskii [57] and are defined\n2\n\n\fin Definition 2.1. Kajiwara and Ohta [34] expressed rational solutions of PII (1.2) in terms of Schur functions by\nexpressing them in the form of determinants, which is how they are defined below (see also [22, 33, 53]); we remark\nthat Flaschka and Newell [27], following the earlier work of Airault [6], expressed the rational solutions of PII (1.2)\nin terms of determinants.\nDefinition 2.1. Consider the polynomials \u03c6n (z) defined by\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u0001\n\u03c6n (z)\u03bbn = exp z\u03bb \u2212 34 \u03bb3 ,\n\nn=0\n\n(2.1)\n\nand then the Yablonskii\u2013Vorob'ev polynomial Qn (z) is defined by\nQn (z) = cn W(\u03c61 , \u03c63 , . . . , \u03c62n\u22121 ),\n\ncn =\n\nn\nY\n\n(2j + 1)n\u2212j ,\n\n(2.2)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere W(\u03c61 , \u03c63 , . . . , \u03c62n\u22121 ) is the usual Wronskian.\nExamples of Yablonskii\u2013Vorob'ev polynomials and plots of the locations of their roots in the complex plane\nare given by Clarkson and Mansfield [22], who showed that the roots have a very regular, approximately triangular\nstructure. The term \"approximate\" is used since the patterns are not exact triangles as the roots lie on arcs rather than\nstraight lines.\n\n2.2 The Adler\u2013Moser polynomials\nBurchnall and Chaundy [3] determined what condition must be satisfied by two polynomials P (z) and Q(z) in such\nthat the indefinite integrals\nZ\nZ\nQ2 (z)\nP 2 (z)\ndz,\ndz,\nQ2 (z)\nP 2 (z)\n\nbe rational, i.e. expressible without logarithms. Under the assumption that P (z) and Q(z) have no common or repeated\nfactors, the problem is reduced to finding polynomial solutions of the bilinear equation\nQ\n\ndP dQ\nd2 P\nd2 P\n\u2212\n2\n= 0.\n+\nP\ndz dz\ndz 2\ndz 2\n\n(2.3)\n\nAirault, McKean, and Moser [7] studied the motion of the poles of rational solutions of the KdV equation (1.1)\nand related the motion to an integrable many-body problem, the Calogero-Moser system, with the Hamiltonian\nH=\n\nN\nX\n\np2j +\n\nj=1\n\nN\nN\nX\nX\n\nj=1 k=j+1\n\n2\n,\n(zj \u2212 zk )2\n\nwhich are described by the following algebraic system\nN\nX\n\u2032\nk=1\n\nwhere\n\nN\nX\n\u2032\nk=1\n\nmeans\n\nN\nX\n\n1\n= 0,\n(zj \u2212 zk )3\n\nj = 1, 2, . . . , N,\n\n(2.4)\n\n. A remarkable fact, first discovered by Airault, McKean, and Moser [7], is that the system\n\nk=1,k6=j\n\n(2.4) has no solutions unless N = 21 n(n + 1), with n \u2208 Z, i.e. a triangular number, in which case the solutions depend\nQN\non n arbitrary complex parameters. Adler and Moser [3] constructed the polynomials \u0398n (z) = k=1 (z \u2212 zk ), which\nare defined in Definition 2.2 below, whose roots satisfy (2.4) and so all solutions of (2.4) can be obtained.

The Schr\u00f6dinger equation (3.18) with potential\nu(z) = z 2 \u2212 2\n\nd2\nln W (Hk1 (z), Hk2 (z), . . . , Hkl (z)) ,\ndz 2\n\n(3.21)\n\nwhere k1 , k2 , . . . , kl are a sequence of distinct positive integers and Hk (z) is the kth Hermite polynomial, has the\neigenstates\n\u0001\n\u0001\nW Hk1 (z), Hk2 (z), . . . , Hkl (z), Hkl+1 (z)\n(3.22a)\n\u03c8(z) =\nexp \u2212 12 z 2 ,\nW (Hk1 (z), Hk2 (z), . . . , Hkl (z))\n\u0001\n\u0001\nW Hk1 (z), Hk2 (z), . . . , Hkl\u22121 (z)\n\u03c8(z) =\nexp 12 z 2 ,\n(3.22b)\nW (Hk1 (z), Hk2 (z), . . . , Hkl (z))\nwith kl+1 a positive integer such that kl+1 6= kj , for j = 1, 2, . . . , l, for the eigenvalues \u03bb = 1 + 2(kl+1 \u2212 l) and\n\u03bb = 2(l \u2212 kl\u22121 ) \u2212 1, respectively.\n\nIt should be noted that the potential (3.21) may possess singularities on the real axis, so that the terms \"eigenstate'\"\nand \"eigenvalue\" should not be understood in quantum mechanics sense. The associated regularity conditions have\nbeen studied by Adler [5] and Dubov, Eleonskii, and Kulagin [24].\nWe remark that substituting\nu(z) = z 2 \u2212 2\n\nd2\nln Q(z),\ndz 2\n\n\u03c8(z) =\n\nP (z)\nexp(\u2212 21 z 2 ),\nQ(z)\n\ninto the Schr\u00f6dinger equation (3.18) yields equation (3.15) with m \u2212 n = \u03bb \u2212 1. Consequently we have the following\nresult (see also Loutsenko [38, Proposition 4]).\n12\n\n\fTheorem 3.7. The bilinear equation (3.15) has polynomial solutions in the form\n\u0001\nP (z) = W Hk1 (z), Hk2 (z), . . . , Hkl (z), Hkl+1 (z) ,\nQ(z) = W (Hk1 (z), Hk2 (z), . . . , Hkl (z)) ,\n\n(3.23a)\n(3.23b)\n\nwhere k1 , k2 , . . . , kl , kl+1 are a sequence of distinct positive integers and Hk (z) is the kth Hermite polynomial.\nFurther the degrees of the polynomials P (z) and Q(z), respectively m and n, are given by\nm=\n\nl+1\nX\nj=1\n\nkj \u2212 21 l(l + 1),\n\nn=\n\nl\nX\nj=1\n\nkj \u2212 12 l(l \u2212 1)\n\ni.e. m \u2212 n = kl+1 \u2212 l.\nWe note that the polynomials P (z) and Q(z) given by (3.23) do not involve arbitrary parameters, in contrast to the\nAdler\u2013Moser polynomials which give polynomial solutions of equations (3.5) and (3.8).\nTheorem 3.7 would appear to give a complete classification of polynomial solutions of the bilinear equation\n(3.15). As remarked above, all the polynomials in Tables 3.1 and 3.2 have the form (3.23), with Hkj (z) replaced\n\u221a\nby Hkj (z/ 2) and scaled so that the polynomials are monic.\nHowever there are additional polynomial solutions of equation (3.15) in terms of the generalized Hermite polynomials Hk1 ,k2 (z) and the generalized Okamoto polynomials \u03a9k1 ,k2 (z). In Table 3.3, there are three pairs of generalized\nHermite polynomials and three pairs of generalized Okamoto polynomials which satisfy equation (3.15), though only\ntwo pairs of each are of the form (3.23) in which the wronskian defining P (z) has one more Hermite polynomial than\nthe wronskian defining Q(z). Specifically the polynomials\nP (z) = Hk1 ,k2 (z) \u2261 W (Hk1 , Hk1 +1 , . . . , Hk1 +k2 \u22121 ) ,\nQ(z) = Hk1 +1,k2 (z) \u2261 W (Hk1 +1 , Hk1 +2 , . . . , Hk1 +k2 ) ,\n\n(3.24a)\n(3.24b)\n\nwhere the wronskians defining P (z) and Q(z) have the same number of Hermite polynomials, and\nP (z) = \u03a9k1 ,k2 (z) \u2261 W(H1 , H4 , . . . , H3k1 \u22122 , H2 , H5 , . . . , H3k2 \u22121 ),\n\n(3.25a)\n\nQ(z) = \u03a9k1 +1,k2 +1 (z) \u2261 W(H1 , H4 , . . . , H3k1 +1 , H2 , H5 , . . . , H3k2 +2 ),\n\n(3.25b)\n\nwhere the wronskian defining P (z) has two fewer Hermite polynomials than the wronskian defining Q(z), are pairs\nof solutions of equation (3.15), yet are clearly not of the form (3.23). An analogous result also holds for the symmetric\nHermite polynomials Hk2n (z) and the symmetric Okamoto polynomials \u03a9kn (z).

Hence we have demonstrated that there are additional\npolynomial solutions of equation (3.15) to those given in Theorem 3.7. The natural question is whether there are any\nmore?\nUsing MAPLE, we have also found the polynomial solutions of equation (3.15) with m = n and with m = n + 1,\ngiven in Tables 3.4 and 3.5, respectively, which have the property that either the polynomials P (z) or Q(z), or both,\nhave multiple roots, other than z = 0, and the polynomials P (z) and Q(z) have common roots, other than z = 0.\nFurther these polynomials do not appear to be wronskians of Hermite polynomials.\n13\n\n\fP\nQ(z) \u221a\n\u221a(z)\n\u221a\n5 z + 2)3\n(z 2 + 5 z + 2)(z 4 + 2 5 z 3 + 6z 2 \u2212 3)\n\u221a \u00013\n\u221a \u0001\u0002\n\u221a\n\u0003\nz 2 + 43 + 41 i 15\nz 2 + 43 + 41 i 15 z 4 \u2212 ( 43 \u2212 14 i 15)z 2 + 34\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(z + 12 6)6\n(z 3 + 32 6 z 2 + 32 z \u2212 74 6)(z + 21 6)3\n(z 2 + 1)3 (z 2 \u2212 1)\n(z 2 + 1)(z 2 \u2212 1)3\n3 3\n3 2\n2\nz (z + 2 )\nz(z + 23 )(z 6 \u2212 32 z 4 + 49 z 2 \u2212 89 )\n\u221a\n\u221a \u0001\n\u221a \u0001\n\u0001\n3\nz z 2 + 54 + 41 i 31\nz 3 z 2 + 45 + 41 i 31 z 2 \u2212 1 + 21 i 31\n(z 2 + 1)3 (z 2 \u2212 1)\n(z 2 + 1)(z 2 \u2212 1)3\n\u221a\n\u221a \u0003\u0002\n\u221a\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\n3\nz 3 z 2 + 43 (1 + i 7) z(z 2 \u2212 23 ) z 2 + 34 (1 + i 7) z 4 \u2212 23 (1 \u2212 i 7)z 2 \u2212 49\n9\n2\n(z 2 + 23 )6\n(z 2 + 32 )3 (z 6 \u2212 32 z 4 + 27\n4 z \u2212 8)\n3\n3\n3\n3\n(z 2 + 2 )6 (z 2 \u2212 2 )3\n(z 2 + 2 )3 (z 2 \u2212 2 )6\n(z 2 +\n\nTable 3.4: Some additional polynomial solutions of equation (3.15) with m = n.\n\nP (z)\n(z + 1)3\n\nQ(z)\n(z + 2)(z + 1)\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(z 3 + 2 3 z 2 + 29 z + 3)(z + 3)\n(z + 3)3\n(z 2 + 12 )3\nz(z 2 + 12 )(z 2 \u2212 23 )\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(z 2 + 10 z + 3)3\n(z 2 + 10 z + 3)(z 2 + 32 10 z + 6)(z + 12 10)\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(z + 21 14)6\n(z 2 + 23 14 z + 8)(z + 12 14)3\nz(z 2 \u2212 23 )(z 4 + 15\n(z 2 \u2212 23 )3\n4 )\n(z + 2)6 (z + 3)\n(z + 2)3 (z + 3)3\n(z \u2212 2)6 (z \u2212 3)\n(z \u2212 2)3 (z \u2212 3)3\nTable 3.5: Some additional polynomial solutions of equation (3.15) with m = n + 1.\n\n14\n\n\f4 Discussion\nIn paper we have investigated the relationship between equilibria of vortex patterns and the roots of polynomials\nassociated with rational solutions of the Painlev\u00e9 and soliton equations. The examples which we have considered in\nthis paper illustrate the power of the \"method of polynomials\" when it can be used. The polynomials with roots at\nthe positions of the vortices, are obtained from the basic vortex equilibrium equations and then their roots give the\nlocations of the vortices.\nWhen all the vortex circulations have the same absolute value, stationary vortex configurations and uniformly\ntranslating vortex configurations are known to be given by the zeros of the Adler\u2013Moser polynomials and related to\neigenstates of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for rational potentials decaying at infinity.\nFor quadrupole background flow and all the vortex circulations have the same absolute value, vortex configurations\nwere shown to be given by the zeros of polynomials expressed as wronskians of Hermite polynomials and related to\neigenstates of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for rational potentials with quadratic growth at infinity. Further using results on\nthe generalized Hermite polynomials Hm,n (z) and generalized Okamoto polynomials \u03a9m,n (z), which are associated\nwith rational solutions of PIV (1.3), it was shown that there are additional solutions than might be anticipated from\nearlier work of Loutsenko [38], Oblomkov [44], and Veselov [54]. As mentioned above, a natural question is whether\nthere are any more?\nAn interesting open question is whether there is a relationship between vortex dynamics and polynomials associated with rational solutions of other soliton equations, such as the Boussinesq equation (1.4) and the NLS equation\n(1.5). Since PIV (1.3) arises as a similarity reduction of the Boussinesq and NLS equations, then one can express rational solutions of these equations in terms of the generalized Hermite and generalized Okamoto polynomials. However\nboth the Boussinesq and NLS equations also have rational solutions which involve arbitrary parameters, analogous to\nthe Adler\u2013Moser polynomials which describe rational solutions of the KdV equation (1.1). For the NLS equation (1.5)\nan extension of the generalized Hermite polynomials, see [20], and for Boussinesq equation (1.4) these polynomials\ninvolve an extension of the generalized Okamoto polynomials, see [21]. These are obtained by replacing the Hermite\npolynomial Hm (z), which is defined by the generating function\n\u221e\nX\nHm (z) \u03bbm\n= exp(2\u03bbz \u2212 \u03bb2 ),\nm!\nm=0\n\nby the polynomial \u03a6m (z) defined by\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u221e\n\u221e\nX\nX\n\u03a6m (z) \u03bbm\n\u03baj \u03bbj \uf8f8 ,\n= exp \uf8ed2\u03bbz \u2212 \u03bb2 +\nm!\nm=0\nj=3\n\nwhere \u03baj , for j \u2265 3, are arbitrary constants in the definitions of the generalized Hermite and generalized Okamoto\npolynomials. (This is similar to the relationship between the Yablonskii\u2013Vorob'ev polynomials and the Adler\u2013Moser\npolynomials where the polynomial \u03c6n (z) defined in equation (2.1) is replaced by the polynomial \u03b8n (z) defined in\nequation (2.5).) Therefore the structure of rational solutions of the Boussinesq equation (1.4) and the NLS equation\n(1.5) is different to those of the KdV equation (1.1) and so other vortex dynamics can possibly be described in terms\nof the associated generalized polynomials.\nAnother interesting open question is whether there exist polynomial solutions of the equations\nd2 P\ndP\n2 Q \u2212 2\u039b dz\ndz\ndP\nd2 P\nQ \u2212 2\u039b\ndz\ndz 2\n2\ndP\nd P\nQ \u2212 2\u039b\ndz\ndz 2\n\ndQ\nd2 Q\n+ \u039b2 P 2 = 0,\ndz\ndz\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\ndP\ndQ\ndQ\n2 d Q\n= 0,\n+\u039b P 2 +\u03bc\nQ \u2212 \u039bP\ndz\ndz\ndz\ndz\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\ndP\ndQ\ndQ\n2 d Q\n+ \u03baP Q = 0,\n+ \u039b P 2 + \u03bcz\nQ \u2212 \u039bP\ndz\ndz\ndz\ndz\n\n(4.1)\n(4.2)\n(4.3)\n\nwhere \u039b 6= 1, \u03bc and \u03ba are constants, which respectively reduce to equations (3.5), (3.8), and (3.14), when \u039b = 1.\nLoutsenko [39] has obtained some polynomial solutions of equations (4.1) and (4.2) in the case when \u039b = 2, which\ncorresponds to the case of vortices with two strengths of unequal magnitudes.\nPatterns of points corresponding to the equilibria of point vortices reveal interesting connections to the classical\ntheory of polynomials and to some of the special polynomials that arise in soliton theory. While some of these\nconnections have been discovered, we believe there is much more that awaits to be found given the large number of\nresults which are known in soliton theory.\n15\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank Mark Ablowitz, Hassan Aref, Carl Bender, Darren Crowdy, Bernard Deconinck, Galina Filipuk,\nThanasis Fokas, Rod Halburd, Andy Hone, Igor Loutsenko, Elizabeth Mansfield, and Bryn Thomas for their helpful\ncomments and illuminating discussions.
