Introduction\nThe notion of weak mixing is one of the strengthenings of the notion of\nergodicity of a measure-preserving transformation. Along with the notions of\nmixing, K-property etc. it belongs to the hierarchy of statistical properties\nof transformations in ergodic theory. This notion complements the notion of\ndiscrete spectrum and has several equivalent characterizations mostly going\nback to Koopman and von Neumann (early 1930's). In 1970 Krengel proved\nin [K] another unexpected characterization of weak mixing. In this paper we\nprove two analogues of Krengel's result for systems that are weakly mixing\nrelative to a factor. Our claim can be alternatively stated in the language\nof random dynamical systems. Before presenting the original theorem and\nits relativization, we provide necessary definitions concerning partitions of\nprobability spaces (a partition is a representation of the space as a finite\ndisjoint union of measurable sets).\nA family of measurable sets in a probability space (X, m) is independent\nif for every finite sub-family A1 , A2 , . . . , Ak we have\nm(\n\nk\n\\\n\nAi ) =\n\ni=1\n\nk\nY\n\nm(Ai ).\n\ni=1\n\nA family of measurable partitions in X is independent if every family of sets\nof the partitions \u2013 one set from each partition \u2013 is independent. If P =\n{A1 , . . . , An } is an ordered partition then dist P , the distribution of P , is a\nvector in Rn defined by (dist P )i = m(Ai ). Consequently, if P = {A1 , . . . , Ak }\nand Q = {B1 , . . . , Bk } are two partitions with the same number of atoms, we\nwill say that P and Q have the same distribution if m(Ai ) = m(Bi ) for all i.\nThe set of all (ordered) partitions into n atoms can be turned into a complete\nPn\nmetric space with the metric dm (P, Q) = i=1 m(Ai \u25b3Bi ). Wherever there\nis no ambiguity we will omit the subscript and denote this distance by plain\nd.\nBy a (dynamical) system we mean a quadruple X = (X, B, m, T ) where\n(X, B, \u03bc) is a probability space and T is an sutomorphism of (X, B, \u03bc), that\n2\n\n\fis T is an invertible \u03bc-preserving map. A sequence {ni } \u2282 Z is called mixing\nfor T if\n\u03bc(A \u2229 T ni B) \u2192 \u03bc(A)\u03bc(B) as i \u2192 \u221e.\nOne characterization of weak mixing of T is that the product system (X \u00d7\nX, B \u00d7 B, \u03bc \u00d7 \u03bc, T \u00d7 T ) is ergodic. An equivalent one is that there exists a\nmixing sequence {ni } \u2282 N for T having density one in N or equivalently there\nexists any mixing sequence at all.\nTheorem (Krengel). (X, B, m, T ) is a weakly mixing system if and only if\nfor every finite measurable partition P of X and \u01eb > 0, there is an infinite\nsequence 0 = n0 < n1 < . . . and a partition P \u2032 with the same distribution as\nP such that d(P, P \u2032 ) < \u01eb and the partitions {T \u2212ni P \u2032 }\u221e\ni=0 are jointly independent.\nKrengel's very technical proof was substantially simplified in 1999 by del\nJunco, Reinhold and Weiss ([JRW]), paving the way for generalizations and\nrefinements. Among other things it was shown there that the sequence in\nKrengel's theorem can be chosen inside any prescribed mixing sequence for\nT . The key tool for this was an extension result for stationary measures on\nAZ . In the subsequent paper [BJ] the extension theorem was generalized to\nAG , G any discrete amenable group, permitting the Krengel theorem to be\ngeneralized to free actions of discrete amenable groups.\nWe restrict our attention to systems (X, B, \u03bc, T ) such that X is a complete metric space and B is the \u03bc-completion of the Borel \u03c3-algebra of X. We\nwill call such systems standard. This assumption involves no loss of generality\nfor theorems of the kind we are concerned with here. We will be studying the\nproperties of (X, B, \u03bc, T ) relative to a distinguished factor algebra F . There\nis no loss of generality in assuming that F is given by F = \u03c0 \u22121 F, where\n\u03c0 : X \u2192 \u03a9 = (\u03a9, F , P, \u03b8)\nis a factor map from X to another standard system \u03a9. The sets \u03c0 \u22121 {\u03c9}, \u03c9 \u2208\n3\n\n\f\u03a9, are the fibers of F . The measure \u03bc decomposes over the factor as\n\u03bc=\n\nZ\n\n\u03bc\u03c9 dP(\u03c9),\n\u03a9\n\nwhere \u03bc\u03c9 is supported on the fiber \u03c0 \u22121 {\u03c9}.\nAs is well-known, when the factor system is ergodic, we can represent X\nas a skew-product over \u03a9:\n(X, B, \u03bc) =(\u03a9, F , P) \u00d7 (Y, C, \u03bd),\nF =F \u00d7 Y,\nT (\u03c9, y) =(\u03b8\u03c9, T\u03c9 y),\nwhere T\u03c9 is an automorphism of (Y, C, \u03bd) which depends measurably on \u03c9.\nThe pair (\u03b8, {T\u03c9 }) is called a random dynamical system.\nFrom now on we identify F with F and write F for both. One definition\nof relative weak mixing uses the relative product of (X, B, \u03bc, T ) = X with\nitself. This is the system\nX \u00d7\u03a9 X = (X \u00d7 X, B \u00d7 B, \u03bb, T \u00d7 T )\nwhere the relative product measure \u03bb = \u03bc \u00d7\u03a9 \u03bc is defined by\n\u03bb=\n\nZ\n\n\u03bc\u03c9 \u00d7 \u03bc\u03c9 dP(\u03c9).\n\n\u03a9\n\nNote that \u03bb is supported on the fibered product\n\u222a{\u03c0 \u22121 {\u03c9} \u00d7 \u03c0 \u22121 {\u03c9} : \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9} \u2282 X \u00d7 X.\nConsequently \u03a9 is a factor of X \u00d7\u03a9 X in a canonical way.\nBy definition X is weakly mixing relative to F if X\u00d7\u03a9 X is ergodic relative\nto F . What this means is that any invariant function for the relative product\nis F -measurable. There is an equivalent characterization as a (relatively)\n4\n\n\fmixing condition: T has a relatively mixing sequence {ni }, which means that\nfor any sets A and B\n\u03bc\u03c9 (A \u2229 T \u2212ni B) \u2212 \u03bc\u03c9 (A)\u03bc\u03c9 (T \u2212ni B)\nconverges to 0 in measure (as a function of \u03c9). Equivalently, T has a relatively\nmixing sequence of density one in N. The existence of a relatively mixing\nsequence of density one in the presence of relative weak mixing follows easily\nfrom [F], Lemma 7.6. The converse fact, that a relatively mixing sequence\nimplies relative weak mixing, is easy since a relatively mixing sequence for\nX is also a relatively mixing sequence for X \u00d7\u03a9 X and the existence of a\nrelatively mixing sequence certainly forces relative ergodicity.\nWe will present two versions of Krengel's theorem for relatively weakly\nmixing systems. The first says that by a uniformly small perturbation of a\ngiven partition it is possible to obtain one with the same distribution on a.a.\nfibers so that it has infinitely many independent iterates on a set of fibers\nwith probability arbitrarily close to 1. \"Probability\" here means the measure\non the factor, in accordance with the ideology of RDS theory. Consequently,\n\"a.s.\" will mean \"for P-a.e. \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9\".\nFor convenience we will state and prove the results in the case of ergodic\nsystems. Theorem 1 remains valid without this assumption and so does Theorem 2, with a minor modification. The proofs are not much more difficult.\nAfter proving the results in section 3 we will make some comments about\nhow to remove the ergodicity assumption. We remark that when T is weakly\nmixing relative to \u03a9, ergodicity of T is equivalent to ergodicity of \u03b8.\nTheorem 1. Let (X, B, \u03bc, T ) be an ergodic system with a factor (\u03a9, F , P, \u03b8)\nR\nwhere \u03bc decomposes as \u03bc = \u03bc\u03c9 dP. Assume {ni }\u221e\ni=0 is a relatively mixing\nsequence for T , and P is a finite partition of X for which there is an \u03b1 > 0\nsuch that\n\u2200p \u2208 P : \u03bc\u03c9 (p) > \u03b1 > 0 for P\u2212a.e. \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9.\n5\n\n\fThen for every \u01eb > 0 there exist a partition Q of X, a set E \u2282 \u03a9, P(E) < \u01eb,\nand a subsequence {mi } of {ni }, such that\ndist \u03bc\u03c9 Q = dist \u03bc\u03c9 P for P-a.e. \u03c9\n\n(1)\n\nd\u03bc\u03c9 (P, Q) < \u01eb for P-a.e. \u03c9\n\n(2)\n\n{T mi Q} is jointly independent with respect to \u03bc\u03c9 \u2200\u03c9 6\u2208 E\n\n(3)\n\nThe independence claim holds for a set of \u03c9 of measure arbitrarily close\nto 1, not P-almost everywhere. This is not a drawback of the method \u2013 if we\nrequire that Q be uniformly close to P then we cannot obtain independence\non almost all fibers. For a counterexample consider the so-called (S, S \u22121 )\ntransformation in its simplest version. Let \u03a9 = Y = {\u22121, 1}Z with the standard product measure P coming from (1/2, 1/2) distribution of probabilities\non {\u22121, 1}, and let \u03b8 = S be the Bernoulli shift: (Sx)n = xn+1 . The (S, S \u22121 )\nmap is a skew product T on \u03a9 \u00d7 Y defined by\nT (\u03c9, y) = (S\u03c9, S \u03c90 y).\nThe family {S \u03c90 } contains only two distinct transformations \u2013 the shifts to\nthe left and to the right. The system is weakly mixing with respect to the\nbase (it is even strongly mixing in the L1 sense \u2013 see [R] for the definitions\nand the proof), but the independence a.e. cannot be achieved even along a\nset of two numbers, say {n1 , n2 }.\nTo see this first observe that if T n1 Q were \u03bc\u03c9 -independent of T n2 Q for\na.a. \u03c9 then, for n = n1 \u2212 n2 , we would also have T n Q \u03bc\u03c9 -independent of Q\nfor a.a. \u03c9. Hence we may as well take n1 = 0 and n2 = n. Choose a partition\nR of Y = \u03a9 such that\ndist P R = (1/2, 1/2) and dP (R, SR) <\n\n1\n.\n100\n\n6\nP\n+1\nExample: viewing R as a map into the index set {\u22121, 1} let R(y) = sign( i=10\nyi ).\ni=1\n(Note that this sum cannot be 0.) Define P on X by P (\u03c9, y) = R(y). Observe\n\nthat\nT n (\u03c9, y) = (\u03b8 n \u03c9, S \u03c6(n,\u03c9) y)\n6\n\n\fwhere\n\u03c6(n, \u03c9) =\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\n\u03c9i .\n\ni=0\n\nNow let \u03b4 = 0 or 1 according to whether n is odd or even. Then the set\nE = {\u03c9 : \u03c6(\u03c9, n) = \u03b4} has positive measure and for \u03c9 \u2208 \u03b8n E we will have\nd\u03bc\u03c9 (P, T n P ) = dP (R, S \u03b4 R) <\n\n1\n.\n100\n\nNow suppose Q is a partition of X such that for almost all \u03c9\n1\n1 1\n.\ndist \u03bc\u03c9 (Q) = ( , ) and d\u03bc\u03c9 (Q, P ) <\n2 2\n100\nThen it is easy to see that for \u03c9 \u2208 \u03b8 n E\nd\u03bc\u03c9 (Q, T n Q) <\n\n3\n.\n100\n\nOn the other hand if Q and T n Q were independent with respect to \u03bc\u03c9 then\nwe would have d\u03bc\u03c9 (Q, T n Q) = 41 , a contradiction.\nIn our second result, by dropping the requirement that the perturbation\nbe uniformly small we are able to obtain the desired independence on almost\nall fibers, rather than just a large set of fibers.\nTheorem 2. With the same hypotheses as in Theorem 1 one can find a\npartition Q and a subsequence {mi } of {ni } such that dist \u03bc\u03c9 Q = dist \u03bc\u03c9 P\nfor a.a. \u03c9, d\u03bc (P, Q) < \u01eb and the partitions {T mi Q} are jointly independent\nwith respect to \u03bc\u03c9 for almost every \u03c9.\nRemark. Of course to say that d\u03bc (P, Q) is small is just to say that d\u03bc\u03c9 (P, Q)\nis small for all but a small set of \u03c9.\nOur presentation conforms to the following plan. After a section on preliminaries and notation we prove in Section 2 a result (Propostion 1) on the\nexistence of measures with prescribed marginals \u2013 a non-stationary generalization of the stationary extension result Theorem 2 in [BJ]. It's proof mimics\n7\n\n\fclosely the proof of the stationary result. Theorems 1 and 2 are proved in\nSection 3.\n1. Notation and Preliminaries\nIn this section we introduce some notation and definitions that pertain\nto Sections 2 and 3. In the beginning of Section 3 more preliminaries are\ncollected that are specific for the proof of the main result.\nFirst we adopt a more formal definition of an ordered partition. A (finite)\npartition of a measurable space (X, B) is a measurable map P from X to a\nfinite index set A (so by definition we are dealing with ordered partitions).\nThe sets p = P \u22121 (a), a \u2208 A, are the atoms of P and we write p \u2208 P . If (X, B)\ncarries a probability measure \u03bc then dist P (or dist \u03bc P if the measure needs\nto be emphasized) denotes the measure \u03bc \u25e6 P \u22121 on A. If B \u2208 B, \u03bc(B) 6= 0\nthen dist \u03bc (P |B) refers to the restriction P |B and the normalized measure\n\u03bcB . We write P \u227a Q (Q refines P ) if each atom of P is a union of atoms of\nQ. For two partitions P and Q indexed by the same alphabet A the distance\nd(P, Q), or d\u03bc (P, Q), between them is\nd(P, Q) = \u03bc{x \u2208 X | P (x) 6= Q(x)}.\nFor a fixed alphabet A this metric defines a complete metric space of partitions.\nTwo partitions of a probability space (X, \u03bc) are independent if every\natom p of the first one is independent of every atom q of the second one:\n\u03bc(p \u2229 q) = \u03bc(p)\u03bc(q). The definition of joint independence of more than two\npartitions is similar. If P and Q are finite partitions of a probability space\n(X, \u03bc) then we will say P is \u03b4-independent of Q whenever\nk dist (P |q) \u2212 dist P k\u221e < \u03b4 \u2200q \u2208 Q.\n(We are identifying a measure \u03c3 on a finite set A with the vector {\u03c3(a)}a\u2208A .)\nWhen P is \u03b4-independent of Q we will write P \u22a5\u03b4 Q (or P \u22a5\u03b4,\u03bc Q). Note\n8\n\n\fthat this definition of approximate independence differs from a more standard\none which uses the l1 -norm and allows a small exceptional set of q's. In fact\nany reasonable defintion of approximate independence could be used in the\nstatements of our results but the one we have chosen is convenient for the\nproofs. We will make use of the fact that if P \u22a5\u03b4 Q and Q \u227b R then P \u22a5\u03b4 R.\n\u03b4\nOne more piece of notation: we write x \u223c y whenever x and y are two\nelements of a space which are no more than \u03b4 apart with respect to some\nmetric or norm which is clear from the context.\n2. Building a measure with prescribed marginals\nThis section is static \u2013 no dynamics are involved. The object of study\nis measures on A\u03a3 , where A is a finite set (alphabet) and \u03a3 is countable.\nWe prove a result on the existence of a probability measure with prescribed\nprojections on AK for K \u2208 F , a certain family of finite subsets F of \u03a3.\nWe will be working with measures on AH for various subsets H \u2282 \u03a3\nand we use the usual Borel structure on AH . Mostly H will be finite. Let\nK1 , K2 \u2282 \u03a3. Whenever K \u2282 L \u2282 \u03a3 we will denote by P K the projection map\nfrom AL to AK , which is a finite partition of AL when K is finite. We will\nalso write P K = \u03c0K . \u03c0K also acts on measures: if m is a measure on AL then\n\u03c0K m = m \u25e6 \u03c0 \u22121 . m is then an extension of \u03c0K m. By definition, if E \u2282 AK ,\nthen m(E) means the same as \u03c0K m(E). Two measures on AK1 and AK2 are\ncalled consistent if their projections on AK1 \u2229K2 coincide. Consistency of a\nfamily of measures means pairwise consistency.\nFor H finite we will say a probability measure m on AH is \u03b4-independent\nwhenever there is an indexing H = {h1 , . . . , hn } such that\nP {hi } \u22a5\u03b4,m P {h1 ,...,hi\u22121 } \u2200i = 2, . . . , n.\nOne easily sees that \u03b4-independence of m implies\nkm \u2212 pH k\u221e < (|H| \u2212 1)\u03b4,\n9\n\n\fwhere pH is the product measure on AH that has the same one-dimensional\nmarginals as m. Note also that if m is \u03b4-independent then so is \u03c0I m for any\nI \u2282 H.\nProposition 1. For every N \u2208 N and \u03b1 > 0 there is a \u03b4 = \u03b4(\u03b1, N ) > 0 such\nthat the following assumptions imply the conclusion below.\nAssumptions:\nA is a finite alphabet, F is a family of finite subsets of \u03a3 and for every\nset K \u2208 F a probability measure \u03bcK on AK is given. These data satisfy:\n(F) \u2200n \u2208 \u03a3 we have | \u222a {K \u2208 F : n \u2208 K}| \u2264 N\n(M1) The measures \u03bcK are pairwise consistent,\n(M2) Every atom of each 1-dimensional marginal of each measure \u03bcK has\nmeasure \u2265 \u03b1.\n(M3) Every measure \u03bcK is \u03b4-independent.\nConclusion:\nThe measures {\u03bcK }K\u2208F have a common extension to A\u03a3 .\nRemark. Evidently there would be no loss of generality in assuming in the\nproposition that \u222aF = \u03a3.\nProposition 1 is an immediate consequence of the following claim.\nClaim A. For every N \u2208 N and \u03b1 > 0 there is a \u03b4 = \u03b4(\u03b1, N ) > 0 and a\n\u03b2 = \u03b2(\u03b1, N ) > 0 such that the following implication holds. Suppose that the\nassumptions of Theorem 1 hold. Suppose further that I is a finite subset of \u03a3\nand \u03bb is a measure on AI that is consistent with every \u03bcK and \u03b2-independent.\nThen there is a measure \u03bb\u2032 on I \u2032 that extends \u03bb, and is again consistent with\nevery \u03bcK and \u03b2-independent.\nRemark. Clearly \u03b4 \u2264 \u03b2. Typically \u03b4 \u226a \u03b2 \u226a 1. Explicitly, one can take\n\u03b2 = \u03b1N /2N , as will be seen from the proof. The expression for \u03b4 = \u03b4(\u03b1, N )\ncan also be developed in principle but we will not need it.\n10\n\n\fProof:\n\nTo prove Claim A we will need two lemmas. These are the Lem-\n\nmas 2.1 and 2.2 from [BJ], the first of which appeared already in [JRW]\n(Proposition 1.2). To make our presentation self-contained, we provide\nsketches of the proofs here and refer the reader to the previous papers for\nmore details.\nThe first lemma deals with signed measures, for which the notions of\nrestriction, extension and consistency remain meaningful.\nLemma 1. Let K be a finite set and {Ki } a finite family of subsets of K\nwhose union is K. Any consistent family of signed measures on AKi has a\ncommon extension \u2013 a signed measure on AK .\nSketch of the proof. We are given the measures \u03bcKi , i = 1, . . . , n. Pick an\narbitrary probability measure q on AK . For every J \u2282 {1, . . . , n} denote by\n\u03bcJ the common projection of \u03bcKj , j \u2208 J , onto A\u2229{Kj :j\u2208J } , multiplied by\n\u03c0{Kj :j\u2208J } q. One common extension is\n\u03bc=\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)|J |+1 \u03bcJ .\n\n\u22056=J \u2282{1,...,n}\n\nThis expression is inspired by the inclusion-exclusion formula in combinatorics\nand the proof is based on the same idea \u2013 when the expression for \u03bc is pro6 {1, . . . n} can be divided into\njected to any of the AKi 's the sum over all J =\npairs that cancel out.\n\nLemma 2. Suppose V and W are finite-dimensional real normed vector\nspaces and \u03a0: V \u2192 W is any surjective linear map. Then there is a constant C = C(\u03a0) with the following property: if v \u2208 V and w = \u03a0(v) 6= 0 then\n\u03a0 has a right inverse B (\u03a0B = idW ) such that Bw = v and kBk \u2264 Ckvk/kwk.\nSketch of the proof. Using the equivalence of any two norms in a finitedimensional space it is not hard to see that there is no limitation of generality\n11\n\n\fin the assumption that V is Euclidean and \u03a0 is the orthogonal projection\nonto its subspace W . In this case the result is immediate (C = 1).\n\nS\n\nContinuing with the proof of Claim A, we shall assume, as we may, that\nF = \u03a3. Fix n \u2208 \u03a3\\I, denote I \u2032 = I \u222a {n}, Fn = {K \u2208 F | n \u2208 K} and\n\nconsider the following two families of subsets of \u03a3:\nS = {K \u2229 I \u2032 | K \u2208 Fn },\nR = {K \u2229 I | K \u2208 Fn } = {S\\{n} | S \u2208 S}.\n\nS and R are finite families of sets. All sets in S contain n. Let\nS = \u222aS and R = \u222aR.\nClearly R = S\\{n}, S \u2282 I \u2032 , R \u2282 I, and by (F) the cardinality of S does not\nexceed N .\nWe are going first to construct a probability measure \u03c3 on AS \u2013 a prospective marginal of \u03bb\u2032 . It necessarily has to satisfy the three conditions derived\nfrom the corresponding conditions imposed on \u03bb\u2032 by Claim A, namely\n\u03c0R \u03c3 = \u03c0R \u03bb,\n\n\u03c0K\u2229I \u2032 \u03c3 = \u03c0K\u2229I \u2032 \u03bcK\n\n(1)\n\nfor every K \u2208 Fn ,\n\n(2)\n\nP {n} \u22a5\u03b2,\u03c3 P R .\n\n(3)\n\nLet us assume for the moment that we have already constructed \u03c3 satis\u2032\n\nfying (1), (2) and (3). Because of (1) we can then define \u03bb\u2032 on AI to be the\nrelative product measure \u03bb\u2032 = \u03bb \u00d7AR \u03c3, that is\n12\n\n\f\u03bb\u2032 (x) =\n\n\u03bb(\u03c0I x)\u03c3(\u03c0S x)\n\u03bb(\u03c0R x)\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2200x \u2208 AI .\n\n\u03bb\u2032 is certainly an extension of \u03bb and of \u03c3. \u03bb\u2032 is consistent with every \u03bcK ,\nK \u2208 F , or equivalently \u03bb\u2032 is an extension of \u03c0K\u2229I \u2032 \u03bcK , because either \u03c3 or \u03bb\nis such an extension (depending on whether n \u2208 K or not).\nMoreover the definition of \u03bb\u2032 together with (3) implies that for all X \u2208\nP {n} , Y \u2208 P R and Z \u2208 P I\\R we have\n\u03b2\n\n\u03bb\u2032 (X|Y \u2229 Z) = \u03c3(X|Y ) \u223c \u03c3(X) = \u03bb\u2032 (X).\nThis means that P {n} \u22a5\u03b2,\u03bb\u2032 P I , and since \u03bb is \u03b2-independent it follows that\n\u03bb\u2032 is also \u03b2-independent, completing the proof of Claim A and Proposition 1.\nWe now proceed to construct \u03c3. For each S = K \u2229 I \u2032 \u2208 S and for each\nR = K \u2229 I \u2208 R, where K \u2208 Fn , let\n\u03bcS = \u03c0S \u03bcK and \u03bdR = \u03c0R \u03bcK .\nBy the consistency of the measures \u03bcK these requirements unambiguously\ndefine \u03bcS and \u03bdR even though K1 \u2229 I \u2032 = K2 \u2229 I \u2032 does not imply K1 = K2 .\nMoreover, both {\u03bcS }S\u2208S and {\u03bdR }R\u2208R are consistent families of measures.\nWe let V denote the vector space of all signed measures \u03c1 on AR and W\nthe space of all consistent families {\u03c1R }R\u2208R , where \u03c1R is a signed measure\non AR , both spaces endowed with the l\u221e -norm. We let \u03a0 : V \u2192 W denote\nthe projection map, that is \u03a0(\u03c1) = {\u03c0R \u03c1}R\u2208R for each \u03c1 \u2208 V , so we have\n\u03a0(\u03c0R \u03bb) = {\u03bdR }R\u2208R . Lemma 1 tells us that \u03a0 is surjective so by Lemma 2\nwe conclude that \u03a0 has a right inverse B such that\nB({\u03bdR }R\u2208R ) = \u03c0R \u03bb,\nand\nkBk \u2264 Ck\u03c0R \u03bbk/k{\u03bdR }R\u2208R k,\n13\n\n\fwhere C = C(\u03a0) is a constant depending on \u03a0. However, \u03a0 is completely\ndetermined by specifying the sets R \u2208 R, which are subsets of R, and by the\ncondition (F ) the cardinality of the latter is less than N , so there are less\nN\nthan 2N subsets. Therefore there are less than (2N )2 possibilities for the\nprojection \u03a0. This means that we may take C to be a constant depending only\non N . Since \u03c0R \u03bb is a probability measure we have k\u03c0R \u03bbk\u221e \u2264 1. Moreover\nthe hypothesis (M2) ensures that |A| \u2264 \u03b1\u22121 . Since each \u03bdK is a probability\nmeasure on AK , a set of cardinality less than |A|n , we have\nk{\u03bdR }R\u2208R k\u221e > \u03b1N ,\nso we obtain an absolute bound kBk \u2264 C\u03b1\u2212N = C \u2032 .\nRecalling that R\u222a{n} = S, we view each y \u2208 AS as a pair y = (x, a), x \u2208\nAR , a \u2208 A, and use a similar convention for the sets AS , S \u2208 S. With this\nconvention, if \u03c3 is a signed measure on AS and a \u2208 A then \u03c3(*, a) is a (signed)\nmeasure on AR . Note that the family {\u03bcS }S\u2208S can be rewritten in the form\n{\u03bcR\u222a{n} }R\u2208R , and \u03bcR\u222a{n} (*, a) is a measure on AR for each R \u2208 R. We now\ndefine \u03c3 by specifying that\n\u03c3(*, a) = B({\u03bcR\u222a{n} (*, a)}R\u2208R ) \u2200a \u2208 A.\nNote that the consistency of the family {\u03bcR\u222a{n} (*, a)}R\u2208R follows from the\nconsistency of the family {\u03bcR\u222a{n} }R\u2208R . We then have\nX\n\u03c3(*, a)\n\u03c0R \u03c3 =\na\u2208A\n\n=\n\nX\n\nB({\u03bcR\u222a{n} (*, a)}R\u2208R )\n\na\u2208A\n\n=B\n\nX\n\n{\u03bcR\u222a{n} (*, a)}R\u2208R\n\na\u2208A\n\n!\n\n(since B is linear)\n\n= B({\u03bdR }R\u2208R ) = \u03c0R \u03bb,\nestablishing (1). To check (2) observe that for each a \u2208 A and R \u2208 R we have\n(\u03c0R\u222a{n} \u03c3)(*, a) = \u03c0R (\u03c3(*, a)) = \u03c0R B({\u03bcQ\u222a{n} (*, a)}Q\u2208R ) = \u03bcR (*, a),\n14\n\n\fsince \u03a0B = idW .\nIt remains to check that \u03c3 is non-negative and satisfies (3). Note that\nall \u03bdR and \u03bcR\u222a{n} , R \u2208 R, are \u03b4-independent. Denote generically by pL the\nproduct measure of 1-dimensional marginals on A{l} , l \u2208 L. In particular p{n}\nis the common 1-dimensional marginal of all measures in Fn , ). Now recall\nthat for R \u2208 R\nk\u03bcR\u222a{n} \u2212 pR\u222a{n} k\u221e < (|R \u222a {n}| \u2212 1)\u03b4 = |R|\u03b4 < N \u03b4.\nSimilarly k\u03bdR \u2212 pR k\u221e < N \u03b4. Therefore\nN\u03b4\n\n\u03bcR\u222a{n} (x, a) \u223c p{n} (a)pR (x)\nN\u03b4\n\n\u223c p{n} (a)\u03bdR (x)\n\n\u2200 R \u2208 R, x \u2208 AR , a \u2208 A.\n\nThis means (since we are using l\u221e -norms) that for all a \u2208 A\n2N \u03b4\n\n{\u03bcR\u222a{n} (*, a)}R\u2208R \u223c p{n} (a){\u03bdR }R\u2208R ,\nso using kBk \u2264 C \u2032 and linearity of B we obtain\n\u03c3(*, a)\n\n2C \u2032 N \u03b4\n\n\u223c\n\np{n} (a)B({\u03bdR }R\u2208R ) = p{n} (a)\u03c0R \u03bb.\n\n(4)\n\nSince \u03c0R \u03bb is \u03b2-independent and |R| < N , for each x \u2208 AR we have\nN\u03b2\n\n\u03c0R \u03bb(x) \u223c pR (x) > \u03b1N .\nN\n\nTaking \u03b2 = \u03b12N it follows that \u03c0R \u03bb(x) > \u03b1N /2 for all x \u2208 AR . Combining\n\u03b2\u03b1N\nthis with (4) and taking \u03b4 = 4C\n\u2032 N we get\n4C \u2032 N \u03b4\n\u03c3(x, a)\n\u2212 p{n} (a) <\n=\u03b2\n\u03c0R \u03bb(x)\n\u03b1N\n\n\u2200x \u2208 AR , a \u2208 A.\n\n(5)\n\nSince p{n} (a) \u2265 \u03b1 and \u03b2 \u2264 \u03b1/2 this shows that \u03c3 takes only positive values\nso it is a probability measure. (5) also shows that P {n} \u22a5\u03b2,\u03c3 P R , establishing\n(3) and concluding the proof of Claim A and Proposition 1.\n15\n\n\f3. Relatively Independent Iterates of a Partition\nIf T is an ergodic invertible measure-preserving tansformation of X, P is\na partition of X and K is any subset of Z then the partition P K , indexed by\nAK , is defined by\n[P K (x)](k) = P (T k x), for x \u2208 X, k \u2208 K,\nInformally, P K (x) = {P (T k x)}k\u2208K , the function P evaluated along the Korbit of x. P K (x) is called the P, K-name of x. Note that the atoms of P K\nare the atoms of the common refinement of the partitions {T \u2212k P : k \u2208 K}.\nFor this reason we it is convenient for us in this section to restate Theorems\n1 and 2 in terms of sequences of negative times which are mixing, that is we\nreplace T with T \u22121 . Note also that {ni } is relatively mixing if and only if\n{\u2212ni } is relatively mixing.\nWe will say that P is independent over K if the partitions {T \u2212k P, k \u2208\nK} are jointly independent, equivalently dist P K is the product of its one\ndimensional marginals. We will use the same terminology in the relative\nsetting, that is with respect to the fiber measures \u03bc\u03c9 . Similar observations\napply to approximate independence, for example P {l} is \u03b4-independent of P K\nW\nif and only if T \u2212l P is \u03b4-independent of k\u2208K T \u2212k P .\n\nTheorem 1. Let (X, B, \u03bc, T ) be an ergodic system with a factor (\u03a9, F , P, \u03b8)\nR\nwhere \u03bc decomposes as \u03bc = \u03bc\u03c9 dP. Assume {\u2212ni }\u221e\ni=0 is an \u03a9-mixing sequence for T and P is a finite partition of X for which there is an \u03b1 > 0 such\nthat\nforP-a.e.\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9\u2200p \u2208 P we have \u03bc\u03c9 (p) > \u03b1.\nThen for every \u01eb > 0 there exist a partition Q of X, a set E \u2282 \u03a9, P(E) < \u01eb,\nand a subsequence {mi } of {ni }, such that\ndist \u03bc\u03c9 Q = dist \u03bc\u03c9 P for P -a.e. \u03c9,\n\n(1)\n\nd\u03bc\u03c9 (P, Q) < \u01eb for P -a.e. \u03c9\n\n(2)\n\n16\n\n\fand\nP is independent over {mi } with respect to \u03bc\u03c9 for all \u03c9 6\u2208 E.\n\n(3)\n\nProof:\nThere are two cases: \u03b8 has a set of periodic points of positive\nmeasure, and \u03b8 is aperiodic. In the first case, by the ergodicity of \u03b8 it must be\na rotation on a finite number k of points. By dropping to a sub-sequence we\nmay assume that the ni are all congruent modulo k, say ni = n\u2032i +r, where the\nn\u2032i are multiples of k. The independence we are aiming for over a subsequence\nnij (which is now on every fiber) is then equivalent to independence over\nn\u2032ij , so we may as well assume that the ni are themselves multiples of k, say\nni = qi k. For each \u03c9 T k preserves the measure \u03bc\u03c9 and {qi } is mixing for\n(T, \u03bc\u03c9 ). Fix any \u03c90 and apply the non-relative version of Theorem 1 ([BJ]\nTheorem 2, also [JRW] Theorem 5) to (T k , \u03bc\u03c90 ) to modify P by a small\namount on the fiber over \u03c90 , obtaining a new partition and a subsequence of\n{qi } which give the desired independence with respect to \u03bc\u03c90 . Now repeat\nthe process in the fiber over \u03b8\u03c90 with the new partition and subsequence to\nobtain the desired independence with respect to \u03bc\u03b8\u03c90 . Iterating the process\nuntil we get to \u03b8 k\u22121 \u03c90 concludes the argument in the periodic case.\nIn the aperiodic case we will proceed inductively starting with Q0 = P ,\nm0 = 0, \u1ebc0 = \u2205 and building the sequences {Qj }, {mj } and {Ej } so that for\nall j \u2265 1, P(Ej ) < \u01eb/2j and\n(1\u2032 )\n\ndist \u03bc\u03c9 Qj = dist \u03bc\u03c9 Qj\u22121 for P-a.e. \u03c9,\n\n(2\u2032 )\n\nd\u03bc\u03c9 (Qj , Qj\u22121 ) < \u01eb/2j for P-a.e. \u03c9,\n\n(3\u2032 )\n\nQ is jointly independent over {mi }ji=1 with respect to \u03bc\u03c9 for all \u03c9 6\u2208 \u1ebcj\nwhere \u1ebcj := \u1ebcj\u22121 \u222a Ej = \u222aji=0 Ei .\n\nAssume for a moment that this construction has been carried out. Then\ndefining\n\u221e\nE = \u222a\u221e\nj=0 \u1ebcj = \u222aj=0 Ej\n\n17\n\n\f(so P(E) < \u01eb) and Q = lim Qj we get (1), (2) and (3) satisfied. The limit is\ntaken in the symmetric difference metric in the space of partitions. The space\nis complete, and the sequence of partitions is Cauchy by (2\u2032 ). Therefore we\nare done.\nThe proof of the theorem is thereby reduced to the induction step. For\nconvenience we now get rid of unnecessary subscripts and constants and restate in equivalent form what remains to be proved. Use the assumptions\nof the theorem and let K be a subset of N \u222a {0} containing 0 so that P is\nindependent over K with respect to \u03bc\u03c9 for all \u03c9 outside some E \u2282 \u03a9.\nGiven \u01eb > 0 we are looking for m \u2208 {ni }, m > max K, a partition Q of\nX and \u1ebc \u2282 \u03a9, P(\u1ebc) < \u01eb, such that\n(1\u2032\u2032 )\n\ndist \u03bc\u03c9 Q = dist \u03bc\u03c9 P for P-a.e. \u03c9,\n\n(2\u2032\u2032 )\n\nd\u03bc\u03c9 (P, Q) < \u01eb for P-a.e. \u03c9,\n\n(3\u2032\u2032 )\n\nQ is independent over K \u222a {m} with respect to \u03bc\u03c9 \u2200\u03c9 6\u2208 E \u222a \u1ebc\nDenote |K| = k and let \u03b7 =\n\n1 \u03b1k+1\n10 2 \u03b4\u01eb\n\nwhere \u03b4 = \u03b4(\u03b1, k 2 + 1) from\n\nProposition 1 (in section 2) \u2013 this choice of \u03b7 will become clear later on. By\nthe hypothesis, we know that, for \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9\\E, P is independent over K with\nrespect to \u03bc\u03c9 , in other words dist \u03bc\u03c9 P K is the product of its one-dimensional\nmarginals. Using the mixing property of the sequence {\u2212ni } pick m \u2208 {ni }\n\u01eb\n,\nsuch that m > max K and for \u03c9 \u2208\n/ E1 , P(E1 ) < 10\nP m \u22a5\u03b7,\u03bc\u03c9 P K .\nLet B\u03a9 \u2282 \u03a9 be the base of a Rokhlin tower R for \u03b8 of height M where\nM > 10m/\u01eb, with error set\nE2 = \u03a9\\\nof measure less than\n\n\u01eb\n10 .\n\n[\n\n{\u03b8i B\u03a9 : 0 \u2264 i < M }\n\nThe tower R can be lifted to X by \u03c0 \u22121 , where \u03c0\n\nis the factorization map. This tower in X can informally be regarded as an\n\"integral of towers\" with bases B\u03c9 = \u03c0 \u22121 {\u03c9}, \u03c9 \u2208 B, and this observation\n18\n\n\finspires the construction that follows. Let M = [0, M \u2212 1]. With \u03c9 \u2208 B\u03a9\n\u22121\nfixed, its M -orbit {\u03b8j \u03c9}M\nj=0 gives rise to the T -tower R\u03c9 whose levels are the\nfibers \u03c0 \u22121 (\u03b8j \u03c9) endowed with measures \u03bc\u03b8j \u03c9 .\nLet \u03bd\u03c9 = dist \u03bc\u03c9 P M , a probability measure on AM . Denote K \u2032 = K \u222a\n\n{m}. For all j that satisfy j + K \u2032 \u2282 M let \u03bd\u03c9,j = \u03c0j+K \u2032 \u03bd\u03c9 . For those values\n\u2032\nof j for which \u03b8j \u03c9 6\u2208 E \u222a E1 the measure dist \u03bd\u03c9,j on Aj+K is \u03b7-independent,\nby our choice of m and because its marginal on Aj+K is exactly independent.\nWe now aim at perturbing P to obtain Q that satisfies (1\u2032\u2032 ) and (2\u2032\u2032 ) and for\n\u2032\nwhich dist \u03bc\u03c9 Qj+K is exactly independent for all combinations of \u03c9 and j\ncorresponding to \u03b8j \u03c9 outside of a set slightly larger than E \u222a E1 .\nFix an \u03c9 \u2208 B\u03a9 and consider the tower R\u03c9 . Denote its base \u03c0 \u22121 {\u03c9} by\n\u01eb\n, independently of\nB. Partition B into two parts B = B0 \u222a B1 , \u03bc\u03c9 (B0 ) = 10\nM -names of the points in B (i.e. after proper normalization dist \u03bc\u03c9 P M on\neach of B0 and B1 is identical to that on B). This can be done since the fibers\nof \u03c0 are non-atomic by the mixing property of T .\nWe will construct the required partition Q by re-assigning points on the\nM -tower above B0 to the letters of the alphabet A (the technique known as\n\"painting names on towers\"), while retaining this assignment on the M -tower\nabove B1 . We now explain how the re-assignment is done. (Recall that \u03c9 is\nfixed for the time being.)\nLet m\u03c9,j denote the projection of \u03bd\u03c9 onto A{j} , a probability measure on\nA{j} which is the same as dist \u03bc\u03b8j \u03c9 P (up to identification of A{j} with A{0} ).\nOf course the one-dimensional marginal of \u03bd\u03c9,j on A{j+k} for any particular\nk is m\u03c9,j+k . For all j satisfying\n0 \u2264 j \u2264 M \u2212 m and \u03b8 j \u03c9 \u2208\n/ E \u222a E1\n\n(\u2217)\n\n\u2032\n\nwe define a \"correcting measure\" \u03be\u03c9,j on Aj+K by the following equation:\nY\n(1 \u2212 (\u01eb/10))\u03bd\u03c9,j + (\u01eb/10)\u03be\u03c9,j =\nm\u03c9,j+k .\nk\u2208K \u2032\n\nThe idea is that blending a small fraction of \u03be\u03c9,j into \u03bd\u03c9,j corrects it from\napproximate to exact independence. A priori \u03be\u03c9,j is a signed measure but we\n19\n\n\fshall see shortly that it is in fact positive. Observe that for any k \u2208 K \u2032 the\nmarginal of \u03be\u03c9,j on Aj+k is m\u03c9,j+k , since that is the case for both \u03bd\u03c9,j and\nQ\nk\u2208K \u2032 m\u03c9,j+k .\nThe definition of \u03be\u03c9,j is equivalent to\nY\nY\n\u0001\n\u03be\u03c9,j \u2212\nm\u03c9,j+k \u2212 \u03bd\u03c9,j .\nm\u03c9,j+k = ((10/\u01eb) \u2212 1)\n(4)\nk\u2208K \u2032\n\nk\u2208K \u2032\n\nBy our choice of m the l\u221e -norm of the right hand side of (4) is less than\n\u03b1k+1\n\u03b1k+1\n10\n\u03b7=\u03b4\n<\n.\n\u01eb\n2\n2\nQ\n\u2032\nSince the minimal value of k\u2208K \u2032 m\u03c9,j+k on singletons in Aj+K is at least\n\u03b1k+1 we conclude that \u03be\u03c9,j is indeed positive.\n\u2032\n\nProjecting the relation between the measures from Aj+K to Aj+K we\nconclude that \u03c0Aj+K \u03be\u03c9,j is the product of its one-dimensional marginals\nm\u03c9,j+k , since this is true for \u03c0Aj+K \u03bd\u03c9,j . In addition, we claim that for all j\n\nsatisfying (*) the measure \u03be\u03c9,j is \u03b4-independent. In view of the mutual independence of the first k (out of the total of k + 1) one-dimensional marginals\nof this measure it would be enough to prove that for all x \u2208 Aj+K and a \u2208 A\nwe have\n\u03be\u03c9,j (x, a)/\u03c0Aj+K \u03be\u03c9,j (x) \u2212 \u03c0A{j+m} \u03be\u03c9,j (a) < \u03b4.\n\u2032\n\n(As in Section 2 we view y \u2208 Aj+K as a pair y = (x, a), x \u2208 Aj+K , a \u2208\nA{j+m} .) This is achieved by our choice of \u03b7, as the following calculation\nshows. Evaluate (4) at (x, a) and then divide by\n\u03c0Aj+K \u03be\u03c9,j (x) = \u03c0Aj+K \u03bd\u03c9,j (x) =\n\nY\n\nm\u03c9,j+k\n\nk\u2208K\n\nto obtain\n\n\u03be\u03c9,j (x, a)/\u03c0Aj+K \u03be\u03c9,j (x) \u2212 \u03c0A{j+m} \u03be\u03c9,j (a)\n\u0001 \u03bd\u03c9,j (x, a)\n10\n\u22121\n\u2212 \u03c0A{j+m} \u03bd\u03c9,j (a)\n=\n\u01eb\n\u03c0Aj+K \u03bd\u03c9,j (x)\n10 1 \u03b1k+1\n<\n* \u03b4\u01eb\n\u2264 \u03b4.\n\u01eb 10\n2\n\n20\n\n\fProposition 1 of Section 2 can now be applied to the family F of those\nshifts j + K \u2032 of K \u2032 for which j satisfies (*), endowed by the measures \u03be\u03c9,j . (F)\nholds for N = k 2 + 1. (M1), the consistency condition for the measures \u03be\u03c9,j ,\nis implied by the consistency of \u03bd\u03c9,j . (M2) holds because the 1-dimensional\nmarginals of \u03be\u03c9,j are the same as for \u03bd\u03c9,j . (M3) has just been demonstrated.\nSo there is a measure \u03be\u03c9 on AM that is a common extension of all the measures\nin the family. Write the names on the levels of the T -tower above B0 as\nprescribed by \u03be\u03c9 . Explicitly what this means is we choose a partition R of B0\nindexed by AM so that dist (R|B) = \u03be\u03c9 and thenwe partition the tower over\nB0 according to the rule: for each x \u2208 B0 and j \u2208 M let Q(T j x) = (R(x))(j).\nTo complete the construction of the partition Q on the whole M -tower above\nB recall that this partition coincides with P above B1 .\nThe procedure we described depends on the point \u03c9 \u2208 B\u03a9 . Performing it\nfor every \u03c9 \u2208 B\u03a9 we get a partition Q of the whole \u03c0 \u22121 (\u03a9\\E2 ). On \u03c0 \u22121 (E2 )\njust declare Q := P . One only needs to assure that Q can be chosen \u03bcmeasurable. This follows from the fact that for any measurable A \u2282 X and\n0 < t < 1 there is a set B \u2282 X such that \u03bc\u03c9 B = t for a.a. \u03c9 and A and\nB are independent with respect to \u03bc\u03c9 for a.a. \u03c9. Using this and following\nevery step of the procedure it is easy to convince oneself that everything can\nbe done in a \u03bc-measurable way.\nHaving done all this, we obtain a partition Q of X that clearly satisfies\n(1\u2032\u2032 ) and (2\u2032\u2032 ). (1\u2032\u2032 ) holds because the 1-dimensional marginals of the measures\n\u03bd\u03c9,j and \u03be\u03c9,j are the same. (2\u2032\u2032 ) is satisfied even with \u01eb/10 instead of \u01eb. By\nvirtue of the construction, (3\u2032\u2032 ) is satisfied for all \u03c9 outside E \u222a E1 \u222a E2 \u222a E3 .\nE1 and E2 have been defined above, while E3 is the set of m uppermost levels\nin the M -tower for \u03b8 with base B\u03a9 . So P(E3 ) < m/M < \u01eb/10. Therefore\ntaking \u1ebc = E1 \u222a E2 \u222a E3 we obtain the required version of (3\u2032\u2032 ).\n\nRemark. The proof shows that, as in [JRW]and [JB], the independence can\n21\n\n\fbe achieved not just along the sequence {mi }, but also along the IP-set which\nP\nit generates, namely the set of all finite sums of the form i\u2208F mi , where F\nis a finite subset of N.\nTheorem 2. With the same hypotheses as in theorem 1 there is a Q and a\nsubsequence {mi } such that dist \u03bc\u03c9 Q = dist \u03bc\u03c9 P for a.a. \u03c9, d(P, Q) < \u01eb and\nQ is independent over {mi } with respect to \u03bc\u03c9 for almost every \u03c9.\nThe proof is a modification of the proof of Theorem 1, using the following\nlemma.\nLemma 3. Suppose K is a finite subset of N and P is a partition which is\nindependent over K with respect to \u03bc\u03c9 for all \u03c9 \u2208\n/ E where E is some subset\nof \u03a9. Then for any \u01eb > 0 there is a partition Q such that P and Q agree on\nall fibers not in KE = \u222a{T k E : k \u2208 K}, dist \u03bc\u03c9 P = dist \u03bc\u03c9 Q for all \u03c9 and\nthere is a subset F \u2282 \u03a9 with \u03bc(F ) < \u01eb such that Q is independent over K\nwith respect to \u03bc\u03c9 for all \u03c9 \u2208\n/ F.\nProof:\nLet B \u2282 \u03a9 be the base of a Rohlin tower of height n \u226b k =\nmax K. Fix \u03c90 \u2208 B. As in the proof of Theorem 1 we will describe how to\nchange P on the tower over \u03c0 \u22121 {\u03c90 }, with the understanding that this should\nbe done simultaneously for each \u03c90 \u2208 B, in a measurable varying way.\nFix any i1 such that 0 \u2264 i1 \u2264 n\u2212k and \u03b8 i1 \u03c90 \u2208 E. Now change P on each\n\u03c0 \u22121 (\u03b8 i1 +k \u03c90 ), k \u2208 K, retaining the same distribution on each of these fibers,\nto obtain a new partition P1 so that, with respect to \u03bc\u03c90 , P1 is independent\n[0,n]\\(i+K)\n. This is\nover i1 + K and in addition P1i1 +K is independent of P1\npossible simply because the fibers are non-atomic.\nOf course we will then have that P1 is independent over K with respect\nto \u03bc\u03b8i1 \u03c90 . In addition, for any i 6= i0 such that 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u2212k and \u03b8i \u03c90 \u2208\n/ E, we\nwill still have that P1K is independent over K with respect to \u03bc\u03b8i \u03c90 . Indeed,\nwith respect to \u03bc\u03c90 , P1 is independent over S1 = i + K \u2229 (i1 + K)c , since P\nhas this property while P1 agrees with P over the relevant fibers. Also with\nrespect to \u03bc\u03c90 , P1 is independent over S2 = i + K \u2229 (i1 + K), since P1 is\n22\n\n\factually independent over all of i1 + K by construction. Finally P1S1 and P1S2\nare independent with respect to \u03bc\u03c90 , again by construction of P1 . This shows\nthat P1 is independent over i + K with respect to \u03bc\u03c90 which implies that P1\nis independent over K with respect to \u03bc\u03b8i \u03c90\nNow replace i1 with any i2 , 0 \u2264 i2 \u2264 n \u2212 k such that we still do not\nhave the desired independence with respect to \u03bc\u03b8i2 \u03c90 and modify P1 to P2\nas before to achieve the independence with respect to \u03bc\u03b8i2 \u03c90 . Continuing in\nthis way we will arrive at a partition Q which has the desired independence\nwith respect to \u03bc\u03b8i \u03c90 for every i, 0 \u2264 i < n \u2212 k. Note also that Q differs\nfrom P only on fibers over over KE. Doing this for all \u03c90 \u2208 B we obtain the\ndesired independence with respect to \u03bc\u03c9 for all \u03c9 \u2208 \u03b8 i B, 0 \u2264 i < n \u2212 k and\nthe measure of this set of \u03c9's can be made as small as we please.\n\nCorollary 1. Lemma 3 holds with \u01eb = 0.\nProof:\n\nIterating Lemma 3 with a summable sequence of \u01eb's produces a\n\nsequence of partition which, by the Borel-Cantelli lemma, eventually stabilizes\nover \u03c9 for a.a. \u03c9. This gives a limiting partition Q with the desired properties.\n\nNow it is to prove Theorem 2: in the proof of theorem 1 at each stage,\nafter achieving the independence of Pk over {m1 , . . . , mk } with respect to \u03bc\u03c9\nfor a large set of \u03c9, use Corollary 1 to change Pk over a small set of \u03c9 to\nachieve the desired independence over a.a. \u03c9. This concludes the proof of\nTheorem 2.\n\nWe now sketch how to remove the ergodicity assumption in theorems 1\nand 2. Let us first observe that it is enough to prove the result in the case\nwhen \u03b8 is periodic with period n \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , \u221e}. Indeed, supposing that we\n23\n\n\fhave done this, partition \u03a9 into the invariant sets \u03a9n , n = 1, 2, . . . , \u221e where\n\u03b8 has period exactly n. We start in \u03a9\u221e and find a Q\u221e uniformly close to\nP over \u03a9\u221e and equal to P over \u03a9\\\u03a9\u221e , and a first subsequence {mi } which\ngives the desired independence in the fibers over most of \u03a9\u221e . Then we work\nover \u03a91 and find Q1 close to Q\u221e and a further subsequence which gives the\ndesired independence on most of \u03a91 . We continue in this way, perturbing the\npartition and refining the subsequence, for finitely many steps until we have\nexhausted all but a small invariant set E \u2282 \u03a9 consisisting of some tail of the\nsequence {\u03a9n }. For Theorem 1 we only need independence on all but a small\nsubset of \u03a9 so we are done. In the case of theorem 2, if we are willing to relax\nthe requirement that the perturbed partition have the same distribution as\nthe original one on all fibers, we can get the desired independence on fibers\nover E by simply making the partition trivial on those fibers.\nSo, we may now assume that \u03b8 has constant period k, possibly infinite.\nIn both theorems 1 and 2 the case k = \u221e is identical to the ergodic case since\naperiodicity is all that is needed for the Rohlin lemma. In the case when\nk is finite, Theorem 1, the same congruence trick used in the ergodic case\nreduces us to working with T k so we may assume that \u03b8 = id\u03a9 . So we have\nreduced ourselves to proving the non-ergodic versions of Theorems 1 and 2 in\nthe case when \u03b8 is the identity. In the case of Theorem 1 this is just a slightly\nsouped up version of the absolute theorem where instead of having just one\nweakly mixing system one has a whole measurable field of them. It is quite\nstraightforward to prove this by suitably modifying the proof of the absolute\nresult. To actually carry it out would require us to delve into the proof of\nthe absolute result. This is the reason that we chose to prove theorems 1 and\n2 formally only in the ergodic case. In the case of Theorem 2 we again just\nmake the partition trivial in the small set of fibers where Theorem 1 does not\ngive independence.\nThe observant reader will have noticed that Theorems 1 and 2 do not\nquite generalize Krengel's theorem in that we don't insist that the subsequence\n24\n\n\f{mi } start with m1 = 0. The place where our argument would break down if\nwe wanted m1 = 0 is at the congruence trick used to deal with the periodic\ncase. The results may well be true with m1 = 0 and in any case our argument\nshows that they do hold at least when \u03b8 is aperiodic.\nAcknowledgments. We would like to thank B.
