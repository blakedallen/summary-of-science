This uses the\nnewly proved equivalence between the notions of R-trivial monoid and\nweakly ordered monoid.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nRecently, Denton [4] gave a formula for a complete system of primitive orthogonal idempotents for the 0-Hecke algebra of type A, the first since the\nquestion was raised by Norton [6] in 1979. A complete system of primitive\northogonal idempotents for left regular bands was found by Brown [3] and\nSaliola [9]. Finding such collections is an important problem in representation\ntheory because they decompose an algebra into projective indecomposable\nmodules: if {eJ }J\u2208I is such a collection for a finite dimensional algebra A,\nthen A = \u2295J\u2208I AeJ , where each AeJ is a projective indecomposable module.\nThey also allow for the explicit computation of the quiver, the Cartan invariants, and the Wedderburn decomposition of the algebra (see [2, 1]). For\n1\n\n\fexample, in [5], Denton, Hivert, Schilling, and Thi\u00e9ry use a construction of\na system of primitive orthogonal idempotents for any J-trivial monoid S to\nderive combinatorially the Cartan matrix and quiver of S.\nSchocker [10] constructed a class of monoids, called weakly ordered monoids,\nto generalize simultaneously 0-Hecke monoids and left regular bands, with\nthe broader aim of finding a complete system of orthogonal idempotents for\nthe corresponding monoid algebras. We achieve this goal here.\nA key step is to recognize that the notions of weakly ordered monoid\nand R-trivial monoid are one and the same. This was first pointed out\nto us by Thi\u00e9ry [13] after an intense discussion between the authors and\nDenton, Hivert, Schilling, and Thi\u00e9ry. In Section 2, we fill out an outline\nof a proof provided by Steinberg [12], who independently made this same\nobservation. In Section 3, we use this equivalence to build a recursive formula\nfor a complete system of primitive orthogonal idempotents for any R-trivial\nmonoid. This covers, in particular but not only, the previously known cases\nof J-trivial monoids [5] and left regular bands.\n\n2\n\nWeakly ordered monoids and R-trivial monoids\n\nGiven any monoid S, that is, a set with an associative multiplication and an\nidentity element, we define a preorder \u2264 as follows. Given u, v \u2208 S, write\nu \u2264 v if there exists w \u2208 S such that uw = v. We write u < v if u \u2264 v\nbut u 6= v. Unless stated otherwise, the monoids throughout the paper are\nendowed with this \"weak\" preorder. In the monoid theory literature, the\ndual of this preorder is known as Green's R-preorder.\nDefinition 2.1. A finite monoid S is said to be a weakly ordered monoid\nif there is a finite upper semi-lattice (L, \u0016) together with two maps C, D :\nS \u2192 L satisfying the following axioms:\n1. C is a monoid morphism, i.e. C(uv) = C(u) \u2228 C(v) for all u, v \u2208 S.\n2. C is a surjection.\n3. If u, v \u2208 S are such that uv \u2264 u, then C(v) \u0016 D(u).\n4. If u, v \u2208 S are such that C(v) \u0016 D(u), then uv = u.\n\n2\n\n\fRemark 2.2. This notion was introduced by Schocker [10] to generalize\n0-Hecke monoids and left regular bands, with the broader aim of finding a\ncomplete system of orthogonal idempotents for the corresponding monoid\nalgebras. In his paper, he actually calls these weakly ordered semigroups.\nHowever our understanding is that monoids include an identity element and\nsemigroups do not. So throughout the paper we call these weakly ordered\nmonoids.\nDefinition 2.3. A monoid S is R-trivial if, for all x, y \u2208 S, xS = yS\nimplies x = y.\nWe restrict our discussion to finite R-trivial monoids.\nExample 2.4. A monoid S is called a left regular band if x2 = x and\nxyx = xy for all x, y \u2208 S. Left regular bands are R-trivial. Indeed, if\nxS = yS, then there exist u, v \u2208 S such that xu = y and x = yv. But then,\nsince uv = uvu,\nx = yv = xuv = xuvu = yvu = xu = y.\nFinitely generated left regular bands are also weakly ordered monoids, see\nShocker [10], e.g. 2.4 and Brown [3, Appendix B].\nExample 2.5. Let G be a Coxeter group with simple generators {si : i \u2208 I}\nand relations:\n\u2022 s2i = 1,\n\u2022 si sj si sj * * * = sj si sj si * * * for some positive integers mij .\n| {z } | {z }\nmij\n\nmij\n\nThen the 0-Hecke monoid H G (0) has generators {Ti : i \u2208 I} and relations:\n\u2022 Ti2 = Ti ,\n\u2022 Ti Tj Ti Tj * * * = Tj Ti Tj Ti * * * for some positive integers mij .\n{z\n} |\n{z\n}\n|\nmij\n\nmij\n\nThe weakly ordered monoid H G (0) has maps C and D onto the lattice of\nsubsets of I. The map C is the content of an element: C(Ti1 Ti2 * * * Tik ) =\n{i1 , i2 , . . . , ik }. The map D is the set of right descents of an element: D(x) =\n3\n\n\f{i \u2208 I : xTi = x}. Note that the preorder for this monoid coincides with the\nweak order on the elements of the Coxeter group G.\nOf particular interest is the case when G is the symmetric group Sn .\nNorton [6] gave a decomposition of the monoid algebra CH Sn (0) into left\nideals and classified its irreducible representations. She raised the question\nof constructing a complete system of orthogonal idempotents for the algebra,\nwhich was first answered by Denton [4].\nExample 2.6. Let S be the monoid with identity generated by the following\nmatrices:\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\ng1 := \uf8f0 0 0 1 \uf8fb and g2 := \uf8f0 0 1 0 \uf8fb .\n0 0 1\n0 0 1\n\nThen S = {1, g1 , g2 , g1 g2 , g2 g1 } and S is both an R-trivial monoid and a\nweakly ordered monoid. For example, we can take L to be usual lattice of\nsubsets of {1, 2}, with C : S \u2192 L given by\nC(1) = \u2205, C(g1 ) = {1}, C(g2 ) = {2}, C(g1 g2 ) = C(g2 g1 ) = {1, 2},\nand D : S \u2192 L given by\nD(1) = \u2205, D(g1 ) = {1}, D(g2 ) = D(g1 g2 ) = {2}, D(g2 g1 ) = {1, 2}.\nThe monoid S, however, is neither a left regular band, since g1 g2 is not\nidempotent, nor isomorphic to the 0-Hecke monoid H G (0) on two generators,\nsince the latter always has an even number of elements.\nThe fact that the above examples are all weakly ordered and R-trivial is\nno coincidence: the purpose of this section is to show that these two notions\nare equivalent.\nRemark 2.7. A monoid S is R-trivial if and only if the preorder \u2264 defined\nabove is a partial order.\nProof. Suppose S is an R-trivial monoid and x, y \u2208 S are such that x \u2264 y\nand y \u2264 x. Then there exist u, v \u2208 S such that xu = y and yv = x. So\ny \u2208 xS and x \u2208 yS, implying that yS \u2286 xS and xS \u2286 yS. That is, xS = yS.\nSince S is R-trivial, x = y.\nOn the other hand, suppose that the given preorder is a partial order,\nand that xS = yS for some x, y \u2208 S. Since x = x * 1 \u2208 xS = yS, we have\nthat x = yu for some u \u2208 S. So y \u2264 x. Similarly, y \u2208 xS implies that x \u2264 y.\nThe antisymmetry of \u2264 implies then that x = y. So S is R-trivial.\n4\n\n\fCorollary 2.8. A weakly ordered monoid is an R-trivial monoid.\nProof. Let S be a weakly ordered monoid. Lemma 2.1 in [10] shows that the\ndefining conditions of a weakly ordered monoid imply that the preorder on\nS is a partial order. The result now follows from Proposition 2.7.\nWe will show that any finite R-trivial monoid S is a weakly ordered\nmonoid using an argument outlined by Steinberg [12]. We must establish the\nexistence of an upper semi-lattice L and two maps C and D from S to L\nthat satisfy the conditions of Definition 2.1. We gather here the definitions\nof L, C and D:\n1. L is the set of left ideals Se generated by idempotents e in S, ordered\nby reverse inclusion;\n2. C : S \u2192 L is defined as C(x) = Sx\u03c9 , where x\u03c9 is the idempotent power\nof x (see Lemma 2.10);\n3. D : S \u2192 L is defined as D(u) = C(e), where e is some maximal element\nin the set {s \u2208 S : us = u} (with respect to the preorder \u2264).\nThe following lemma is a simple statement about R trivial monoids which\nis used frequently throughout the paper.\nLemma 2.9. Suppose S is an R-trivial monoid. If x, y, z \u2208 S are such that\nxyz = x, then xy = x.\nConsequently, if x, y1 , y2 , . . . , ym \u2208 S are such that xy1 * * * ym = x, then\nxyi = x for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m.\nProof. If xyz = x then xyS = xS. Therefore xy = x by the definition of S\nbeing R-trivial. The second statement immediately follows from the first.\nThe remainder of this section is dedicated to showing that these objects\nare well defined and that they satisfy the conditions of Definition 2.1. We\nbegin by recalling some classical results from the monoid literature. The\nfollowing is [7, Proposition 6.1].\nLemma 2.10. If S is a finite monoid, then for each x \u2208 S, there exists\na positive integer \u03c9 = \u03c9(x) such that x\u03c9 is idempotent, i.e. (x\u03c9 )2 = x\u03c9 .\nFurthermore, if S is R-trivial, then we also have x\u03c9 x = x\u03c9 .\n\n5\n\n\fProof. Consider the elements x, x2 , x3 , . . . . Since S is finite, there exist positive integers i and p such that xi+p = xi . Then xk+p = xk for all k \u2265 i, so if\nwe take \u03c9 = ip, then (x\u03c9 )2 = x\u03c9+ip = x\u03c9 .\nIf S is R-trivial, then x\u03c9 \u2264 x\u03c9 x \u2264 x\u03c9 x\u03c9 = x\u03c9 , and so x\u03c9 x = x\u03c9 .\nRemark 2.11. In what follows, if x \u2208 CS and there exists N such that\nxN +1 = xN , we sometimes abuse notation by writing x\u03c9 in place of xN .\nLemma 2.12. Let S be a finite R-trivial monoid. For all x and y in S,\n1. (xy)\u03c9 x = (xy)\u03c9 ;\n\n5. (x\u03c9 y \u03c9 )\u03c9 x\u03c9 = (x\u03c9 y \u03c9 )\u03c9 ;\n\n2. (xy)\u03c9 y = (xy)\u03c9 ;\n\n6. (x\u03c9 y \u03c9 )\u03c9 = (x\u03c9 y \u03c9 )\u03c9 (xy);\n\n3. (xy)\u03c9 x\u03c9 = (xy)\u03c9 ;\n\n7. (x\u03c9 y \u03c9 )\u03c9 = (x\u03c9 y \u03c9 )\u03c9 (xy)\u03c9 .\n\n4. (xy)\u03c9 y \u03c9 = (xy)\u03c9 ;\nProof. (1) Since (xy)\u03c9 x \u2208 (xy)\u03c9 S, it follows that (xy)\u03c9 xS \u2286 (xy)\u03c9 S.\u0001 To\nshow the reverse inclusion, note that (xy)\u03c9 = (xy)\u03c9 (xy) = (xy)\u03c9 x y \u2208\n(xy)\u03c9 xS, where the first equality follows from Lemma 2.10. So (xy)\u03c9 S \u2286\n(xy)\u03c9 xS. Thus (xy)\u03c9 xS = (xy)\u03c9 S. Since S is an R-trivial monoid, the\ndesired result follows.\n(2) Apply (1) and Lemma 2.10:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(xy)\u03c9 = (xy)\u03c9 (xy) = (xy)\u03c9 x y = (xy)\u03c9 y.\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n\nThis follows from applying (1) repeatedly.\nThis follows from applying (2) repeatedly.\nLet u = x\u03c9 and v = y \u03c9 . Now, by (1), (uv)\u03c9 u = (uv)\u03c9 .\nWe compute:\n(x\u03c9 y \u03c9 )\u03c9 = (x\u03c9 y \u03c9 )\u03c9\u22121 x\u03c9 y \u03c9\n= (x\u03c9 y \u03c9 )\u03c9\u22121 x\u03c9 y \u03c9 y\n= (x\u03c9 y \u03c9 )\u03c9 y\n= (x\u03c9 y \u03c9 )\u03c9 x\u03c9 y\n= (x\u03c9 y \u03c9 )\u03c9 x\u03c9 xy\n= (x\u03c9 y \u03c9 )\u03c9 xy\n\n(by Lemma 2.10)\n(by (5))\n(by Lemma 2.10)\n(by (5))\n\n(7) This follows by repeatedly applying part (6).\n6\n\n\fWe are now ready to construct a lattice corresponding to the R-trivial\nmonoid S. Define\nL := {Se : e \u2208 S such that e2 = e}.\nThat is, L is the set of left ideals generated by the idempotents of S. Define\na partial order on L by\nSe \u0016 Sf \u21d0\u21d2 Se \u2287 Sf.\nProposition 2.13. If e, f are idempotents in S, then S(ef )\u03c9 is the least\nupper bound of Se and Sf in L.\nProof. First, let us show that S(ef )\u03c9 is an upper bound for Se and Sf .\n\u03c9\nSince, by Lemma 2.12 (1), (ef )\u03c9 = (ef )\u03c9 e, we have that\n\u0010 (ef ) \u0011\u2208 Se. Hence\nS(ef )\u03c9 \u2286 Se and S(ef )\u03c9 \u0017 Se. Moreover, (ef )\u03c9 = (ef )\u03c9\u22121 e f \u2208 Sf . So\nS(ef )\u03c9 \u2286 Sf and S(ef )\u03c9 \u0017 Sf . So S(ef )\u03c9 is an upper bound for Se and\nSf .\nNext, let us show that S(ef )\u03c9 is the least upper bound for Se and Sf .\nSuppose g is an idempotent in S such that Sg is an upper bound for Se and\nSf . That is, Sg \u2286 Se and Sg \u2286 Sf . Since Sg \u2286 Se, g = te for some t \u2208 S.\nBut then ge = (te)e = te2 = te = g. Similarly, Sg \u2286 Sf implies that gf = g.\nSo g(ef ) = (ge)f = gf = g and it follows that\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n2\ng = g(ef ) = g(ef ) (ef ) = g(ef ) = g(ef ) (ef )2 = g(ef )3 = * * * = g(ef )\u03c9 .\nConsequently, g \u2208 S(ef )\u03c9 , Sg \u2286 S(ef )\u03c9 , and Sg \u0017 S(ef )\u03c9 . So S(ef )\u03c9 is the\nleast upper bound of Se and Sf .\nAs a result, we may define the join of two elements Se and Sf in L by\nSe \u2228 Sf = S(ef )\u03c9 .\nThat is, L is an upper semi-lattice with respect to this join operation. This\nobservation proves the following.\nProposition 2.14. The map C : S \u2192 L defined by C(x) = Sx\u03c9 is a surjective monoid morphism.\n\n7\n\n\fProof. Let x, y \u2208 S. By Lemma 2.12 (5), we know that (x\u03c9 y \u03c9 )\u03c9 = (x\u03c9 y \u03c9 )\u03c9 (xy)\u03c9 .\nHence, (x\u03c9 y \u03c9 )\u03c9 \u2208 S(xy)\u03c9 and S(x\u03c9 y \u03c9 )\u03c9 \u2286 S(xy)\u03c9 .\nTo show the reverse inclusion, we begin by noting that, by Lemma 2.12 (2),\n(xy)\u03c9 = (xy)\u03c9 x\u03c9 . So (xy)\u03c9 \u2208 Sx\u03c9 and S(xy)\u03c9 \u2286 Sx\u03c9 . That is, S(xy)\u03c9 \u0017\nSx\u03c9 .\nLemma 2.12 (4), implies that (xy)\u03c9 \u2208 Sy \u03c9 , which implies that S(xy)\u03c9 \u2286\nSy \u03c9 and S(xy)\u03c9 \u0017 Sy \u03c9 . In particular, S(xy)\u03c9 is an upper bound for both Sx\u03c9\nand Sy \u03c9 . So S(xy)\u03c9 \u0017 Sx\u03c9 \u2228 Sy \u03c9 = S(x\u03c9 y \u03c9 )\u03c9 , that is, S(xy)\u03c9 \u2286 S(x\u03c9 y \u03c9 )\u03c9 .\nThus C(xy) = S(xy)\u03c9 = S(x\u03c9 y \u03c9 )\u03c9 = Sx\u03c9 \u2228 Sy \u03c9 = C(x) \u2228 C(y), and C\nis a monoid morphism. Finally, we know that every element of L is of the\nform Se for some idempotent e in S. But then C(e) = Se\u03c9 = Se; that is, C\nis a surjective morphism.\nHere is an alternate and useful characterization of C(x).\nProposition 2.15. C(x) = {a \u2208 S : ax = a} for all x \u2208 S.\n\u0001\nProof.\u0001 Take an arbitrary element in C(x) = Sx\u03c9 , say tx\u03c9 . Since tx\u03c9 x =\nt x\u03c9 x = tx\u03c9 by Lemma 2.10, we see that tx\u03c9 \u2208 {a \u2208 S : ax = a}. On the\nother hand, take b \u2208 {a \u2208 S : ax = a}. Then\nbx\u03c9 = (bx)x\u03c9\u22121 = bx\u03c9\u22121 = (bx)x\u03c9\u22122 = bx\u03c9\u22122 = * * * = bx = b.\nTherefore, b \u2208 Sx\u03c9 .\nWe now define the map D : S \u2192 L. Given u \u2208 S, let D(u) = C(e), where\ne is a maximal element in the set {s \u2208 S : us = u}. To check that D is well\ndefined, let e and f be two distinct maximal elements in {s \u2208 S : us = u}.\nSince e \u2264 ef and u(ef ) = (ue)f = uf = u, by the maximality of e, e = ef .\nSimilarly, since f \u2264 f e and u(f e) = u, the maximality of f implies f = f e.\nThen, by Proposition 2.14,\nC(e) = C(ef ) = C(e) \u2228 C(f ) = C(f ) \u2228 C(e) = C(f e) = C(f ).\nNote that the maximality of e and ue2 = u also implies that e = e2 , that is,\ne is idempotent.\nThe next proposition shows that the maps C and D interact in precisely\nthe manner given in conditions 2 and 3 in Definition 2.1. The following\nlemma will help us prove this proposition.\nLemma 2.16. Let x, y \u2208 S. If x \u2264 y, then C(x) \u0016 C(y).\n8\n\n\fProof. If s \u2208 C(y), then sy = s. Since x \u2264 y, there exists t \u2208 S such that\ny = xt. So sxt = s, implying sx \u2264 s. That is, s \u2208 C(x). Hence C(y) \u2286 C(x),\nor C(x) \u0016 C(y) since s \u2264 sx and S is R-trivial.\nProposition 2.17. Let u, v \u2208 S. (i) If uv \u2264 u, then C(v) \u0016 D(u). (ii) If\nC(v) \u0016 D(u), then uv = u.\nProof. (i) Since u \u2264 uv, u = uv. Hence v lies in the set {s \u2208 S : us = u}.\nLet e be a maximal element in this set such that v \u2264 e. Then, by Lemma\n2.16, C(v) \u0016 C(e) = D(u).\n(ii) By definition, D(u) = C(e), where e is a maximal element of {s \u2208 S :\nus = u}. So if C(v) \u0016 D(u), then C(v) \u0016 C(e). Hence C(e) \u2286 C(v). Since\nue = u, u lies in C(e). So u is also a member of C(v); that is, uv = u.\nPropositions 2.14 and 2.17 tell us that an R-trivial monoid is a weakly\nordered monoid. Combining this with Corollary 2.8, we have the following\nresult.\nTheorem 2.18. A finite monoid S is a weakly ordered monoid if and only\nif it is an R-trivial monoid.\n\n3\n\nConstructing idempotents\n\nDefinition 3.1. Let A be a finite dimensional algebra with identity 1. We\nsay that a set of nonzero elements \u039b = {eJ : J \u2208 I} of A is a complete\nsystem of primitive orthogonal idempotents for A if:\n1. each eJ is idempotent: that is, e2J = eJ for all J \u2208 I;\n2. the eJ are pairwise orthogonal: eJ eK = 0 for J, K \u2208 I with J 6= K;\n3. each eJ is primitive (meaning that it cannot be further decomposed\ninto orthogonal idempotents): if eJ = x + y with x and y orthogonal\nidempotents in A, then x = 0 or y = 0;\n4. {eJ : JP\u2208 I} is complete (meaning that the elements sum to the identity):\nJ\u2208I eJ = 1.\n\n9\n\n\fRemark 3.2. If \u039b is a maximal set of nonzero elements satisfying conditions\n(1) and (2), then \u039b is a complete system of primitive orthogonal idempotents\n(that is, (3) and (4) also hold). Indeed, eJ is primitive, for if eJ could be\nwritten as x+y, then we could replace eJ in \u039b with\nP x and y, contradicting\nP the\nmaximality of \u039b. To see (4), we just note that if K eK 6= 1, then 1\u2212 K eK\nis idempotent and orthogonal to all other eK . Combining this element with\n\u039b would again contradict the maximality of \u039b.\nLet S denote a finite weakly ordered monoid with C and D being the\nassociated \"content\" and \"descent\" maps from S to an upper semi-lattice\nL. We let G denote a set of generators of S. The main goal of this paper is\nto build a method for finding a complete system of orthogonal idempotents\nfor the monoid algebra CS. In particular, this solves the problem posed by\nNorton about the 0-Hecke algebra for the symmetric group.\nFor each J \u2208 L, we define a Norton element AJ TJ . Let us begin by\ndefining TJ :\n\u0011\u03c9\n\u0010 Y\n\u03c9\ng\n\u2208 S.\nTJ =\ng\u2208G\nC(g)\u0016J\n\nRemark 3.3. A different ordering of the set G of generators may produce\ndifferent TJ 's; so we fix an (arbitrarily chosen) order uniformly for all J.\nWe now define the AJ in the Norton element AJ TJ . First we let\nY\n(1 \u2212 g \u03c9 ) \u2208 CS.\nBJ =\ng\u2208G\nC(g)6\u0016J\n\nIn the spirit of Lemma 2.10, we would like to raise BJ to a sufficiently\nhigh power so that it is idempotent. However, BJ is not an element of the\nmonoid S, so (BJ )\u03c9 may not be well defined. The following lemma and\ncorollary shows that it actually is.\nP\nDefinition 3.4. Given x = w\u2208S cw w \u2208 CS, the coefficient of w in x is\ncw . We say that w is a term of x if the coefficient of w in x is nonzero.\n\nLemma 3.5. Let b \u2208 S and suppose bx\u03c9 = b for some x \u2208 G with C(x) 6\u0016 J.\nIf c is a term of bBJ , then c > b.\n\n10\n\n\fProof. Let D = {x\u03c9 : x \u2208 G, C(x) 6\u0016 J, bx\u03c9 = b}. By assumption D is not\nempty. Let g1 , g2 , . . . , gm be the generators which appear in the definition of\nBJ . Then\nX\nBJ =\n(\u22121)k gi\u03c91 gi\u03c92 * * * gi\u03c9k .\ni1 <i2 <***<ik\n\nIt follows from Lemma 2.9 that the coefficient of b in bBJ is counting the\nterms in BJ where each of gi1 , . . . , gik come\nfrom\nD, weighted with sign (\u22121)k .\n\u0001\n\u0001\nIf |D| = m \u2265 1 then this is 1 \u2212 m + m2 \u2212 m3 + * * * + (\u22121)m = 0. Therefore\nc 6= b. The statement now follows from the definition of order, as every term\nc of bBJ must be of the form c = bz for some term z appearing in BJ , and\nhence c \u2265 b.\nLemma 3.6. For every J \u2208 L, there exists an integer N such that y \u03c9 BJN = 0\nfor all y \u2208 G with C(y) \u000e J.\nProof. Let N = l + 1, where l is the length of the longest chain of elements\nin the poset (S, \u2264).\nSuppose y \u03c9 BJN 6= 0. Let cN be a term of BJN . Then cN is a term of\ncN \u22121 BJ for some term cN \u22121 in y \u03c9 BJN \u22121 . Since y \u03c9 y \u03c9 = y \u03c9 , Lemma 3.5 implies\n\u03c9\nthat y \u03c9 is not a term of y \u03c9 BJk for any k \u2265 1, so that cN \u22121 = y \u03c9 g1\u03c9 * * * gm\nfor\n\u03c9\nsome m \u2265 1 and gi \u2208 G with C(gi ) 6\u0016 J. In particular, cN \u22121 gm = cN \u22121 , and\nso, again by Lemma 3.5, cN > cN \u22121 . Repeated application of this argument\nproduces a decreasing chain\ncN > cN \u22121 > cN \u22122 > * * * > c1\nof elements in S, contradicting the fact that the length of the longest chain\nof elements in (S, \u2264) is l.\nCorollary 3.7. For every J \u2208 L there exists an N such that BJN +1 = BJN .\nProof. By Lemma 3.6, (BJ \u2212 1)BJN = 0 for a sufficiently large N since every\nelement of BJ \u2212 1 is of the form \u03b1y \u03c9 where \u03b1 \u2208 C, y \u2208 G and C(y) \u000e J.\nRemark 3.8. Corollary 3.7 is a special property of an R-trivial monoid, and\nis not true for a general monoid. For instance if an element x of a semigroup\nS generates a finite cyclic group of order 2, then (1 \u2212 x)k = 2k\u22121 \u2212 2k\u22121x, so\n(1 \u2212 x)k+1 6= (1 \u2212 x)k for all k.\nThis now allows us to define AJ = BJ\u03c9 .\n11\n\n\fLemma 3.9. Let J \u2208 L. Then:\n1. TJ x = TJ for all x such that C(x) \u0016 J;\n2. y \u03c9 AJ = 0 for all y such that C(y) 6\u0016 J and y \u2208 G.\nProof. Since J = C(TJ ), C(x) \u0016 J implies C(x) \u2287 C(TJ ). We also know\nthat TJ \u2208 C(TJ ) because TJ is idempotent. So TJ \u2208 C(x), that is, TJ x = TJ .\nThe second part follows from Lemma 3.6 since AJ = BJN .\nRemark 3.10. Although TJ and AJ are idempotents individually, their\nproduct, the Norton element zJ , need not be. For example, take the 0-Hecke\nalgebra H6 (0) corresponding to the symmetric group S6 . Let J be the subset\n{1, 4, 5} of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Then TJ = T1 T4 T5 T4 , AJ = (1 \u2212 T2 )(1 \u2212 T3 )(1 \u2212 T2 )\nand zJ is their product. No power of zJ is idempotent.\nLemma 3.11. The coefficient of TJ in zJ = AJ TJ is 1. All other terms y in\nzJ have C(y) \u227b J.\nProof. The coefficient of the identity element 1 in AJ is 1. Each term of\nAJ TJ is of the form aTJ for a term a of AJ . If a 6= 1, then C(a) \u000e J so\nC(aTJ ) = C(a) \u2228 C(TJ ) \u227b C(TJ ) = J. Hence the coefficient of TJ in AJ TJ\nis 1 and all other terms have content greater than J.\nLemma 3.12. If J 6\u0016 K then zJ zK = 0.\nProof. Since J 6\u0016 K, there exists a g \u2208 G with C(g) \u0016 J but C(g) 6\u0016 K.\nThen, using Lemma 3.9 (1) and Lemma 3.9 (2), zJ zK = AJ TJ AK TK =\nAJ (TJ g \u03c9 )AK TK = AJ TJ (g \u03c9 AK )TK = 0.\nLemma 3.13. For all J \u2208 L, there exists an N such that (1 \u2212 zJ )N zJ2 = 0.\nProof. To simplify the notation, let us temporarily set T = TJ , A = AJ and\nz = zJ = AT . We first note that for any integer k \u2265 0,\n(1 \u2212 z)k z 2 = z(1 \u2212 z)k z\n= AT (1 \u2212 AT )k AT\n= A(T (1 \u2212 A)T )k AT.\nWe will show that (T (1 \u2212 A)T )N A = 0 for N > l, where l is the length of\nthe longest chain in the poset (S, \u2264).\n12\n\n\fP\nLet us write 1 \u2212 A =\na\u2208S ca a where each term has ca 6= 0 only if\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\na = g1 * * * gk with C(gi ) 6\u0016 J for all i.

The coefficient of TJ in PJ is 1 and all other terms y of PJ\nhave C(y) \u227b J.\n14\n\n\fProof. If n + m > 0 then, using that TJ is idempotent,\nAJ TJ AJ TJ (1 \u2212 AJ TJ )n+m = AJ TJ AJ (TJ \u2212 TJ AJ TJ )n+m .\nEach term x in (TJ \u2212 TJ AJ TJ )n+m has C(x) \u227b J, so no TJ appears in\nzJ2 (1 \u2212 zJ )n+m . The coefficient of TJ in zJ is 1, by Lemma 3.11. Hence TJ\nappears in zJ2 (1 \u2212 zJ )0 with coefficient 1. By Lemma 3.11, since all of the\nterms y 6= TJ of zJ have C(y) \u227b J and PJ is a polynomial in zJ , all other\nterms w of PJ must have C(w) \u227b J.\nRemark 3.18.

As shown in the calculation above, one could define PJ as\nPJ = 1 \u2212 (1 + (N + 1)zJ )(1 \u2212 zJ )N +1 ,\nwhere N is the length of the longest chain in the monoid, or even N = |S|.\nFor a J-trivial monoid, it suffices to take PJ = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 zJ )N +1 .\n15\n\n\fLemma 3.21. For all J, K \u2208 L, with J 6\u0016 K, PJ PK = 0.\nProof. Follows from Lemma 3.12 and the fact that PJ is a polynomial in zJ\nwith no constant term.\nDefinition 3.22. For each J \u2208 L, let\n1\u2212\n\neJ := PJ\n\nX\n\neK\n\nK\u227bJ\n\n!\n\n.\n\nLemma 3.23. TJ occurs in eJ with coefficient 1. All other terms y of eJ\nhave C(y) \u227b J. In particular, eJ 6= 0.\nProof. We proceed by induction. If J is maximal, then eJ = PJ , so the\nstatement is implied by Lemma 3.17.\nP Now suppose the statement is true for all M \u227b J. Then eJ = PJ (1 \u2212\nM \u227bJ eM ). By induction, all terms x of eM have C(x) \u0017 M \u227b J. So terms\ny from PJ eM have C(y) \u0017 M \u227b J. The only other terms are those from PJ ,\nfor which the statement was proved in Lemma 3.17.\nLemma 3.24. eK PJ = 0 for K 6\u0016 J.\nProof. The proof is by a downward induction on the semi-lattice. If K is\nmaximal, then eK = PK , so by Lemma 3.21, eK PJ = PK PJ = 0.\nNow suppose that for every L \u227b K, eL PJ = 0 for L 6\u0016 J, and we will\nshow that eK PJ = 0 for K 6\u0016 J. We expand eK PJ :\n!\nX\nX\neK PJ = PK 1 \u2212\neL PJ = PK PJ \u2212\nPK eL PJ .\nL\u227bK\n\nL\u227bK\n\nSince K 6\u0016 J, we have PK PJ = 0 by Lemma 3.21, and eL PJ = 0 by induction,\nsince L \u227b K and K 6\u0016 J implies L 6\u0016 J.\nCorollary 3.25. eJ is idempotent.\nProof. We expand eJ eJ :\n!\nX\neJ eJ = PJ 1 \u2212\neM PJ\n\n1\u2212\n\nM \u227bJ\n\n(1)\n\n=\n\nPJ2\n\n1\u2212\n\nX\n\nM \u227bJ\n\neM\n\n!\n\n(2)\n\n= PJ\n\nX\n\neM\n\nM \u227bJ\n\n1\u2212\n\nX\n\n!\n\nM \u227bJ\n\n16\n\n= PJ\n\neM\n\nPJ \u2212\n\nX\n\nM \u227bJ\n\n!\n\n= eJ ,\n\neM PJ\n\n!\n\n1\u2212\n\nX\n\nM \u227bJ\n\neM\n\n!\n\n\fwhere (1) follows from Lemma 3.24, and (2) follows from Lemma 3.19.\nLemma 3.26. eJ eK = 0 for J 6= K.\nProof. The proof is by downward induction on the lattice\nP L. For a maximal\nelement M \u2208 L, eM = PM , so eM eK = PM PK (1 \u2212\neL ) = 0 by Lemma\n3.21. Now suppose that for all M \u227b J, eM eK = 0 for M 6= K and we will\nshow that eJ eK = 0 for J 6= K. We expand eJ eK :\nX\nX\neJ eK = PJ (1 \u2212\neL )eK = PJ (eK \u2212\neL eK )\n(1)\nL\u227bJ\n\nL\u227bJ\n\nP\n\nby our induction hypothesis, so PJ (eK \u2212\nP If K 6\u227b J, then L\u227bJ eL eK = 0P\ne\ne\n)\n=\nP\ne\n=\nP\nP\n(1\n\u2212\nJ KP\nJ K\nL\u227bJ L K\nM \u227bK eM ) = 0 by Lemma 3.21.\nIf K \u227b J, then L\u227bJ eL eK = eK since eK is idempotent\nP and eL eK = 0\nfor L 6= K by the inductive hypothesis. Therefore eK \u2212 L\u227bJ eL eK = 0 and\nhence the right hand side of (1) is zero.\n\nTheorem 3.27. The set {eJ : J \u2208 L} is a complete system of primitive\northogonal idempotents for CS.\nProof. From [10], we know that the maximal number of such idempotents\nis the cardinality of L. The rest of the claim is just Lemma 3.23, Corollary\n3.25 and Lemma 3.26.\n\nAppendix: Two examples\nWe illustrate the above constructions on two examples.\n\nIdempotents for the free left regular band on two generators\nLet S be the left regular band freely generated by two elements a, b. Then\nS = {1, a, b, ab, ba}. All elements of S are idempotent. Also aba = ab and\nbab = ba. The lattice L has four elements: \u2205 := S, a := Sa, b := Sb and ab :=\nSab = Sba, where \u2205 \u227a a \u227a ab and \u2205 \u227a b \u227a ab, but a and b have no relation.\nWe begin by computing the elements PJ .\n\n17\n\n\fJ = \u2205: Neither of the generators satisfies C(g) \u0016 J, so T\u2205 = 1 \u2208 S.\nB\u2205 = (1 \u2212 a)(1 \u2212 b). Also\nB\u22052 = (1 \u2212 a)(1 \u2212 b)(1 \u2212 a)(1 \u2212 b) = (1 \u2212 a \u2212 b + ab)(1 \u2212 a)(1 \u2212 b)\n= (1 \u2212 a \u2212 b + ab)(1 \u2212 b) = (1 \u2212 a \u2212 b + ab) = B\u2205 .\nTherefore A\u2205 = B\u2205 = 1 \u2212 a \u2212 b + ab, so z\u2205 = 1 \u2212 a \u2212 b + ab is idempotent and\nP\u2205 = 1 \u2212 a \u2212 b + ab.\nJ = a: Then C(a) \u0016 a and C(b) 6\u0016 a, so Ta = a and Ba = 1 \u2212 b = Aa\nsince 1 \u2212 b is idempotent. Therefore za = (1 \u2212 b)a = a \u2212 ba. za2 = a \u2212 ab and\none can check that za3 = za2 , so\nPa = za2 (1 + (1 \u2212 za ) + (1 \u2212 za )2 + . . . ) = za2 = a \u2212 ab.\nOne can check that Pa is idempotent.\nJ = b: Similarly,\nPb = b \u2212 ba.\nJ = ab: C(a), C(b) \u0016 ab, so Tab = ab and Aab = 1. zab = ab is idempotent, so\nPab = ab.\nWe can now compute the idempotents eJ . Since ab is maximal,\neab = ab.\nSince Pa eab = (a \u2212 ab)ab = ab \u2212 ab = 0,\nea = Pa (1 \u2212 eab ) = Pa = a \u2212 ab\nand similarly,\neb = b \u2212 ba.\nFinally, note that P\u2205 ea = (1 \u2212 a \u2212 b + ab)(a \u2212 ab) = 0 and similarly P\u2205 eb = 0,\nso that\ne\u2205 = P\u2205 (1\u2212ea \u2212eb \u2212eab ) = P\u2205 \u2212P\u2205 eab = 1\u2212a\u2212b+ab\u2212ab+ba = 1 \u2212 a \u2212 b + ba.\nOne can check that {e\u2205 , ea , eb , eab } is a collection of mutually orthogonal\nidempotents.\n18\n\n\fIdempotents of H S5 (0)\nAs mentioned above, H S5 (0) has generators T1 , T2 , T3 , T4 . In this case, the\ncorresponding lattice L is the lattice of subsets of {1, 2, 3, 4}. The monoid\nH S5 (0) is actually a J-trivial monoid, so we can use the simplified formula\nfrom Remark 3.16. We use the shorthand notation Ti1 ***ik to denote the\nelement Ti1 * * * Tik .\n\u03c9\nIf J = {1, 2, 3, 4}, then TJ = T1234\n= T1234123121 . Also AJ = 1, so zJ =\nAJ TJ = TJ . Also, PJ = zJ , and since J is maximal, eJ = PJ , so\ne{1,2,3,4} = T1234123121 .\nIf J = {1, 2, 3}, then TJ = T123121 and AJ = 1 \u2212 T4 . Then zJ = (1 \u2212\nT4 )T123121 = T123121 \u2212 T4123121 . One can check that zJ2 = zJ , so PJ = zJ . Also,\none can check that PJ is orthogonal to e{1,2,3,4} . So eJ = PJ . Therefore\ne{1,2,3} = T123121 \u2212 T4123121 .\nSimilarly,\ne{2,3,4} = \u2212T1234232 + T234232 .\nNow let J = {1, 2, 4}. Then TJ = T1214 and AJ = (1 \u2212 T3 ). Letting\nzJ = AJ TJ , one can check that zJ (1 \u2212 zJ )2 = 0, so PJ = zJ (1 + (1 \u2212 zJ )).\nAgain PJ is orthogonal to e{1,2,3,4} , so eJ = PJ . Therefore\ne{1,2,4} = \u2212T123423121 + T12343121 \u2212 T34121 + T4121 .\nSimilarly,\ne{1,3,4} = \u2212T123412321 + T12342321 \u2212 T23431 + T3431 .\nWhen J = {1, 2}, TJ = T121 and AJ = (1 \u2212 T3 )(1 \u2212 T4 )(1 \u2212 T3 ). Then\nzJ is already idempotent, so PJ = zJ . One can check that PJ is already\northogonal to e{1,2,3,4} , e{1,2,3} , e{1,2,4} . Therefore,\ne{1,2} = T121 \u2212 T3121 + T34121 \u2212 T343121 \u2212 T4121 + T43121 .\nSimilarly,\n\n19\n\n\fe{3,4} = T12343 \u2212 T123431 \u2212 T2343 + T23431 + T343 \u2212 T3431 .\nIf J = {1, 3}, TJ = T1 T3 and AJ = (1 \u2212 T2 )(1 \u2212 T4 ). One can check\nthat zJ (1 \u2212 zJ )2 = 0, and PJ = zJ (1 + 1 \u2212 zJ ) is idempotent. PJ is orthogonal to e{1,2,3,4} and e{1,2,3} , but not orthogonal to e{1,2,4} . So we define\ne{1,3} = P{1,3} (1 \u2212 e{1,2,4} ). Then\ne{1,3} = \u2212T123121 + T12321 \u2212 T12341231 + T123412321 + T1234231 \u2212 T12342321 \u2212\nT231 +T2341231 \u2212T23412321 +T31 \u2212T341231 +T3412321 +T4123121 \u2212T412321 +T4231 \u2212T431 .\nSimilarly,\ne{2,4} = \u2212T12342312 + T123423121 + T1234232 + T1234312 \u2212 T12343121 \u2212 T123432 +\nT2342312 \u2212T23423121 \u2212T234232 \u2212T234312 +T2343121 +T23432 +T3412 \u2212T342 \u2212T412 +T42 .\nWe continue in this way, constructing all of the idempotents for the algebra. For the sake of completeness, the other idempotents are:\ne{2,3} = \u2212T1232 + T123412312 \u2212 T1234123121 + T232 \u2212 T23412312 + T234123121 +\nT41232 \u2212 T4232 ;\ne{1,4} = \u2212T1234123121 +T123412321 +T123423121 \u2212T12342321 \u2212T12343121 +T1234321 +\nT2341 \u2212 T23421 \u2212 T341 + T3421 + T41 \u2212 T421 ;\ne{4} = \u2212T1234 + T12341 \u2212 T123412 + T1234121 + T12342 \u2212 T123421 + T234 \u2212 T2341 +\nT23412 \u2212 T234121 \u2212 T2342 + T23421 \u2212 T34 + T341 \u2212 T3412 + T34121 + T342 \u2212 T3421 +\nT4 \u2212 T41 + T412 \u2212 T4121 \u2212 T42 + T421 ;\ne{3} = T123 \u2212 T1231 + T1234123 \u2212 T12341232 \u2212 T123423 + T1234232 \u2212 T23 + T231 \u2212\nT234123 + T2341232 + T23423 \u2212T234232 + T3 \u2212T31 + T34123 \u2212T341232 \u2212T3423 + T34232 \u2212\nT4123 + T41231 + T423 \u2212 T4231 \u2212 T43 + T431 ;\ne{2} = \u2212T12 + T12312 \u2212 T123121 + T2 \u2212 T2312 + T23121 + T312 \u2212 T32 \u2212 T3412 +\nT3412312 \u2212 T34123121 + T342 \u2212 T342312 + T3423121 + T34312 \u2212 T3432 + T412 \u2212 T412312 +\nT4123121 \u2212 T42 + T42312 \u2212 T423121 \u2212 T4312 + T432 ;\ne{1} = T1 \u2212 T21 + T231 \u2212 T2321 \u2212 T2341 + T23421 \u2212 T234231 + T2342321 + T23431 \u2212\nT234321 \u2212 T31 + T321 + T341 \u2212 T3421 + T34231 \u2212 T342321 \u2212 T3431 + T34321 \u2212 T41 +\n20\n\n\fT421 \u2212 T4231 + T42321 + T431 \u2212 T4321 .\nFinally, e{} is just the signed sum of all elements, with sign determined\nby Coxeter length:\ne{} =\n\nP\n\nw (\u22121)\n\nl(w)\n\nTw .\n\nOne can check (ideally not by hand!) that {eJ : J \u2286 {1, 2, 3, 4}} is a\ncomplete system of orthogonal idempotents.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are grateful to Tom Denton, Florent Hivert, Anne Schilling,\nBenjamin Steinberg and Nicolas M.
