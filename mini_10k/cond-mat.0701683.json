This paper is not intended as a survey article, rather, we\nwill restrict ourselves to non-equilibrium stationary state Fluctuation Theorems (FTs). A stationary\nstate FT was first discovered in [1]. This FT is a quantitative relation between the probability to\nobserve a positive entropy production \u03c3 versus a negative one \u2212\u03c3 over a time interval \u03c4 . Given the\nprobability distribution \u03c0\u03c4 of a fluctuating quantity p, scaled such that its average is equal to one, the\nConventional Fluctuation Theorem (CFT) (also called the Gallavotti-Cohen Fluctuation Theorem)\ntakes the form [2]\n\u03c0\u03c4 (p)\n1\nlog\n= \u03c3+ p for p < p\u2217 ,\n\u03c4 \u2192\u221e \u03c4\n\u03c0\u03c4 (\u2212p)\n\n(1)\n\nlim\n\nwhere \u03c3+ is the average (dimensionless) entropy production rate over positive times, p = \u03c3/\u03c3+ , and\np\u2217 is an upper bound on the values of p for which the CFT holds.\nWhether the CFT holds depends on the kind of system and on what the quantity p represents.\nChoices for p that have been used in the literature include the phase space contraction rate [2], a\n\"dissipation function\" [3], an \"action functional\" [4], and, more concretely, work, heat and entropy\nproduction. The value of p\u2217 can also depend on the quantity under consideration. The stationary\nstate Fluctuation Theorem holds quite generally (i.e. for a large class of deterministic [1\u20133] and\nstochastic systems [4, 5]), and has been verified in laboratory experiments [6, 7].\nThe behavior for values p > p\u2217 has recently been elucidated for specific systems, and led to an\nExtended Fluctuation Theorem (EFT) for heat [8\u201310], which we will discuss in detail below.\nIn this paper, we will give an overview of some interesting results of the stationary state Fluctuation Theorem for an exactly solvable model of a Brownian particle in a harmonic potential which\nis dragged through a surrounding fluid. While this model is based on a Langevin equation, the\n1\n\n\fconclusions from this model also pertain to certain purely deterministic systems, as we will point\nout.\nWe will first introduce the model in Sec. 2 and discuss its exact solution in Sec. 3. We will\nthen turn our attention to thermodynamic quantities of the dissipated heat and the supplied work,\nand their fluctuations, both for finite and infinite time in Sec. 4. In Sec. 5 we will show that this\nresults in two kinds of stationary state fluctuation relations: the Conventional Fluctuation Theorem\n(CFT), for work fluctuations, and an Extended Fluctuation Theorem (EFT), for heat fluctuations.\nThe paper ends with a discussion in Sec. 6 of the results and generalizations that have appeared in\nthe literature.\n\n2\n\nThe model\n\nConsider a spherical Brownian particle of mass m and diameter D suspended in an equilibrium fluid\nwith viscosity \u03b7 and temperature T . The motion of this Brownian particle can be described by the\nLangevin equation\nm\u1e8d = \u2212\u03b1v + \u03be,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere x is the position of the particle, v = dx/dt its velocity and \u03b1 = 3\u03c0\u03b7D the Stokes friction\ncoefficient. Furthermore, \u03be = \u03be(t) is a Gaussian fluctuating force whose average (over realizations)\nh\u03be(t)i = 0 and whose time correlations are delta-correlated, i.e.\nh\u03be(t1 )\u03be(t2 )i = 2kB T \u03b1\u03b4(t1 \u2212 t2 )1,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere kB is Boltzmann's constant and 1 is the identity matrix.\nConsider now the situation in which an external force acts on the Brownian particle (but not on\nthe fluid). Under the assumption that the fluid is unperturbed such that \u03b1 and the properties of \u03be\nare not changed, the Langevin equation gets modified to\nm\u1e8d = F (x, t) \u2212 \u03b1v + \u03be,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere F (x, t) is the external force, which may depend on position and time.\nOf particular interest here is the case in which the force derives from a moving harmonic potential\nU , i.e.,\nF (x, t) = \u2212\n\n\u2202U (x, t)\n= \u2212\u03ba(x \u2212 x\u2217 (t)),\n\u2202x\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the potential U (x, t) = \u03ba|x \u2212 x\u2217 (t)|2 /2 and the center x\u2217 (t) of the potential changes in time\naccording to\nx\u2217 (t) = v \u2217 t.\n\n(6)\n\nThis corresponds to the particle being trapped in a harmonic well, the center x\u2217 of which moves\nwith a constant velocity v \u2217 , to which we will restrict ourselves here. This closely resembles the\nexperimental system of a Brownian particle in a moving optical trap studied by Wang et al. [11].\nOne also needs to specify the initial condition of the system. In time, the distribution of x and v\napproach a non-equilibrium stationary state distribution fness asymptotically. It is not hard to show\nthat\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u221a\n\u03b2(m|v \u2212 v \u2217 |2 + \u03ba|x \u2212 v \u2217 (t \u2212 \u03b1/\u03ba)|2 )\n\u03b2 \u03bam\nexp \u2212\n,\n(7)\nfness (x, v) =\n2\u03c0\n2\n2\n\n\fwhere \u03b2 = 1/(kB T ). Note that if v \u2217 = 0 this reduces to the equilibrium distribution. To focus\non the non-equilibrium stationary state fluctuations, one can take as an initial condition that the\ndistribution at time t = 0, denoted by f0 , is equal to fness .\nThis system exhibits many features of general non-equilibrium systems, namely the presence of\na current, energy dissipation, and entropy and heat production due to the continuous input of work\nfrom the outside. Thus it can serve as a prototypical non-equilibrium system. The advantage of\nlooking at this particular system is that it can be solved exactly (as was first exploited for work\nfluctuations by Mazonka and Jarzynski [12]). In fact, this system can also be solved exactly for a\ngeneral the time dependence of the center x\u2217 (t) of the harmonic potential, as was shown in [13].\n\n3\n\nThe exact solution\n\nThe exact solution of the Brownian particle system introduced above proceeds through a timedependent change of coordinates that brings the equations into a form in which the force does not\ndepend on time, and whose solution is known.\nAs explained in [13], to eliminate the time dependence of the force, such a coordinate transformation should take the form\nX(t) = x(t) \u2212 x\u0303(t),\n\n(8)\n\nwhere x\u0303 is any solution of the equations of motion in the absence of the fluctuating force. One such\nsolution is\nx\u0303(t) = v \u2217 (t \u2212 \u03b1/\u03ba).\n\n(9)\n\nNote that the new coordinate system corresponds to a frame that is co-moving with the fictitious\nnoiseless trajectory x\u0303(t), and that along this fictitious trajectory, the friction force \u2212\u03b1v \u2217 is exactly\nbalanced by the harmonic force \u2212\u03ba(x\u0303 \u2212 x\u2217 ) = \u03b1v \u2217 .\nIn the co-moving frame, the Langevin equation becomes [cf. Eqs. (4)\u2013(9)]\nm\u1e8c = \u2212\u03baX \u2212 \u03b1V + \u03be,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere V = dX/dt = v \u2212 v \u2217 . Equation (10) is of the same form as Eq. (4) but with v \u2217 = 0, so it\ndescribes the system with a stationary harmonic potential. This system is well-studied and is an\nexample of a so-called Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process [14]. Roughly speaking, an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nprocess is a stationary Markov process that can be described by a Langevin equation with linear\nforces and a Gaussian random force term. Equation (10) is Markovian because the time-derivatives\nof X only depend on quantities at that same time. As a consequence of the Markovian nature of the\nprocess, all its properties can be expressed in terms of the Green's function Gt (X \u2032 , V \u2032 ; X, V ) which\nis the probability, in the co-moving frame, for the particle to be at position X \u2032 with velocity V \u2032 given\nthat it was at position X with velocity V a time t earlier. For Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, the\nGreen's function can be solved exactly and is Gaussian in both the initial coordinates (X, V ) and\nthe final coordinates (X \u2032 ,V \u2032 ). It is this Gaussian property that enables one to obtain many explicit\nresults, as we will see.\nAlthough this system can be solved exactly, to avoid unnecessarily complicated expressions, we\nwill consider here only the overdamped case, which means taking the limit m \u226a \u03b12 /k. In Eq. (10),\nthis limit can be taken by setting m equal to zero, so that it reduces to 0 = \u2212\u03baX \u2212 \u03b1V + \u03be, or\n\u1e8a = \u2212\n\n1\nX + \u03b1\u22121 \u03be,\n\u03c4r\n\n(11)\n3\n\n\fwhere \u03c4r = \u03b1/\u03ba is the (average) relaxation time of this Langevin equation. Like the general case,\nthis equation also describes an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, whose Green's function is given by [14]\n\"\n#\n\u0014\n\u00151/2\n\u2032 \u2212 e\u2212t/\u03c4r X|2\n\u03b2\u03ba\n\u03b2\u03ba\n|X\nGt (X \u2032 ; X) =\nexp \u2212\n.\n(12)\n2\n2\u03c0(1 \u2212 e\u22122t/\u03c4r )\n1 \u2212 e\u22122t/\u03c4r\nGiven a set of times 0 < t1 < t2 < * * * < tm , one can write for the joint probability of the particle\nto be at position Xn at time tn (with t0 = 0):\nP (X0 , X1 , . . . , Xm ) = f0 (X0 )\n\nm\nY\n\nGti \u2212ti\u22121 (Xi ; Xi\u22121 ).\n\n(13)\n\ni=1\n\nBecause each Green's function is Gaussian in both the initial and final positions [cf. Eq. (12)], and\nthe initial distribution in Eq. (7) is also Gaussian in the initial position X0 , the distribution P is\nalso Gaussian.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nThermodynamic fluctuations\nDefinitions\n\nWhile on a macroscopic level, thermodynamic properties such as work, heat and entropy are welldefined, this is not the case on a mesoscopic level. To understand that there is an ambiguity, consider\ntrying to determine the \"energy of the system\" for the Brownian particle under consideration. Should\nthis include the potential energy of the external harmonic force, or should this only be the (kinetic)\nenergy of the Brownian particle itself? Or consider the \"work done on the system\". Should this be\nthe work done by the harmonic force on the particle, or should this be the work needed to move the\nharmonic potential? The first choice is closely related to the mechanical definition of work, but it\nleads to work being done even in equilibrium (although its average would be zero), a problem that is\navoided by using the second choice. There are even more ambiguities when studying dissipation in\nnon-equilibrium systems. When should energy be regarded as dissipated? It would be ambiguous to\nsay that the dissipated energy is that part of the energy input that cannot be used to perform work.\nFor instance, the harmonic potential energy can be used to store energy by displacing the Brownian\nparticle from its origin. Is this dissipated energy? A clever experimentalist may be able to extract\nuseful work from this energy, but should the definition of dissipated energy depend on the ability of\nan experimentalist?\nThe ambiguity is thus due to what to call the system, and what forms of energy to consider as\ninaccessible or dissipated. To avoid this ambiguity, we will now define what we will mean by \"work\"\nand \"heat\" in the rest of the paper. The work will be defined as the work that is required to keep the\nharmonic potential moving. Because at time t the harmonic potential exerts a force \u2212\u03ba(x(t) \u2212 x\u2217 (t))\non the particle, the particle will exert a reaction force \u03ba(x(t) \u2212 x\u2217 (t)) on the harmonic potential\n(or on whatever device generated it). To keep the potential moving therefore requires (at least) a\ncompensating force \u2212\u03ba(x(t)\u2212x\u2217 (t)) to be applied to the potential. Since the velocity of the potential\nis \u1e8b\u2217 = v \u2217 (cf. Eq (6)), the mechanical work done by this compensating force during a time interval\n\u03c4 is\nZ \u03c4\n\u2217\ndt [x(t) \u2212 x\u2217 (t)].\n(14)\nW\u03c4 = \u2212\u03bav *\n0\n\nNote that this definition of \"work on the system\" uses the particle plus the harmonic potential as\nthe system.\nOn the other hand, we will define the heat as the energy which is given off to the fluid, taking the\npoint of view that since the energy of the fluid is not explicitly present in the Langevin description,\n4\n\n\fwe can suppose it to be unaccessible or dissipated energy. This leads to the following expression for\nthe heat:\nQ\u03c4 = W\u03c4 \u2212 \u2206U\u03c4\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u2206U\u03c4 = U (x(\u03c4 )) \u2212 U (x(0)) is the change in harmonic potential from time 0 to time \u03c4 . In\nwords, this states that work can be converted both into potential energy of the Brownian particle,\nor into heat dissipated into the fluid. Note that in the general (non-overdamped) case, the change in\nkinetic energy of the particle should also be subtracted from W\u03c4 to obtain the heat.\n\n4.2\n\nFourier transforms\n\nGiven the definitions of the work and the heat and the Green's function of the process, we can study\nthe probability distributions of their fluctuations. Once the probability distributions are obtained,\nit can be checked whether they obey a stationary state Fluctuation Theorem. In addition (and in\ncontrast to the majority of theoretical works on the subject), the explicit solution available for this\nsystem allows us to consider finite time corrections to these theorems as well. These corrections\ngive information about the time scales on which these stationary state Fluctuation Theorems can be\nobserved.\nAn essential ingredient in the calculation will be that any linear function of a Gaussian distributed\nquantity is again a Gaussian distributed quantity, so that the distribution of such a quantity is fully\ndetermined by its mean and its variance. While the work W\u03c4 in Eq. (14) is a linear function of x(t),\nmaking it Gaussian distributed, the heat Q\u03c4 in Eq. (15) is not a linear function of x(t), but is in\nfact a quadratic function of x(t) and consequently not Gaussian distributed. This quadratic nature\nprevents a straightforward calculation of the heat probability distribution function, but still allows\nthe computation of its Fourier transform, using the following trick.\nConsider first the joint probability P\u03c4\u2217 (W\u03c4 , x(0), x(\u03c4 )) which gives the probability that the particle\nmoves from position x(0) to position x(\u03c4 ) and an amount W\u03c4 of work is done in the process. Since\nthese three quantities are all linear functions of x(t), their joint distribution is Gaussian, i.e. of the\nform\n1\n\nP\u03c4\u2217 (y) =\n\ne\u2212 2 (y\u2212M)*V *(y\u2212M)\n\u221a\n2\u03c0 det V\n\u22121\n\n(16)\n\nwhere for brevity we denoted y = (W\u03c4 , x(0), x(\u03c4 )), M as the mean of y and V as the variance\nmatrix of y.\nUsing P\u03c4\u2217 , the distributions of W\u03c4 and Q\u03c4 can be expressed as\nZ\nP\u03c4W (W ) =\ndy P\u03c4\u2217 (y) \u03b4(W \u2212 W\u03c4 )\n(17)\nZ\n\u0001\nP\u03c4Q (Q) =\ndy P\u03c4\u2217 (y) \u03b4 Q \u2212 W\u03c4 + \u03ba|x(\u03c4 ) \u2212 x\u2217 (\u03c4 )|2 /2 \u2212 \u03ba|x(0) \u2212 x\u2217 (0)|2 /2 ,\n(18)\n\nwhere x\u2217 (t) = v \u2217 t as given by Eq. (6). Taking the Fourier transform of these equations yields\nZ\nW\ndy P\u03c4\u2217 (y)eiq(W \u2212W\u03c4 )\n(19)\nP\u0302\u03c4 (q) =\nZ\n\u2217 2\n2\n(20)\nP\u0302\u03c4Q (q) =\ndy P\u03c4\u2217 (y)eiq(Q\u2212W\u03c4 +\u03ba|x(\u03c4 )\u2212v \u03c4 | /2\u2212\u03ba|x(0)| /2) ,\nwhere q is the Fourier variable. The integrals on the right hand sides are all just Gaussian integrals,\nwhich can be performed explicitly once M and V are determined.

Its probability distribution \u03c0\u03c4W (p) is related to that of W by a Jacobian: \u03c0\u03c4W (p) =\nP\u03c4W (W )dW/dp = P\u03c4W (\u03b2W/(\u03c3+ \u03c4 ))(\u03c3+ \u03c4 /\u03b2), so that\n\u2212\n\n\u03c3 \u03c4 (p\u22121)2\n\u201e +\n\u00ab\n\u2212\u03c4 /\u03c4r\n4 1\u2212 1\u2212e\n\u03c4 /\u03c4r\n\ne\n\u03c0\u03c4W (p) = r \u0010\n2\u03c0 1 \u2212\n\n(24)\n1\u2212e\u2212\u03c4 /\u03c4r\n\u03c4 /\u03c4r\n\n\u0011\n\n/(\u03c3+ \u03c4 )\n\nThe Fourier inversion of P\u0302\u03c4Q is more involved because no closed form is known for the Fourier\ninverse of Eq.

We are therefore left with the following formal expression for \u03c0\u03c4Q (p):\n\n\u03c0\u03c4Q (p) =\n\n\u03c3+ \u03c4\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ndq\u0303 e\u2212iq\u0303\u03c3+ \u03c4 p\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u00bb\n\u03c3+ \u03c4 q\u0303[i\u2212q\u0303] 1\u2212\n\ne\n\n2q\u0303 2 (1\u2212e\u2212\u03c4 /\u03c4r )\n\u03c4 (1+(1\u2212e\u22122\u03c4 /\u03c4r )q\u0303 2 )\n\n[1 + (1 \u2212 e\u22122\u03c4 /\u03c4r )q\u0303 2 ]3/2\n\n\u2013\n\n.\n\n(25)\n\nWe are especially interested in the large \u03c4 behaviour of this function. The presence then of a large\nparameter in the exponent in the integrand allows us to obtain an approximate result using the\nsaddle point approximation. To exhibit the large parameter \u03c4 in Eq. (25) explicitly, we write\nZ\nQ\n\u03c3+ \u03c4 \u221e\nQ\n\u03c0\u03c4 (p) =\ndq\u0303 e\u03c4 h\u03c4 (q\u0303) ,\n(26)\n2\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\nwhere\nhQ\n\u03c4 (q\u0303) = \u03c3+\n\n(\n\n\"\n\n2q\u0303 2 (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 /\u03c4r )\n\u2212iq\u0303p + q\u0303 [i \u2212 q\u0303] 1 \u2212\n(\u03c4 /\u03c4r )(1 + (1 \u2212 e\u22122\u03c4 /\u03c4r )q\u0303 2 )\n6\n\n#)\n\n\u2212\n\nh\ni\n3\nlog 1 + (1 \u2212 e\u22122\u03c4 /\u03c4r )q\u0303 2 .\n2\u03c4\n\n\f(27)\nIn the saddle point method, the main contribution to the integral is found by considering the\nQ\nmaximum q\u0303 \u2217 of the function hQ\n\u03c4 (q\u0303). A complicating factor is that h\u03c4 is complex valued. If one takes\nQ\nq\u0303 \u2217 to be the point on the real line where h\u03c4 has a maximum real part, then the integrand can be\nhighly oscillatory there, causing the contribution of this otherwise dominant point to be washed out.\nA maximum that does not suffer from this oscillatory behavior can be found, but usually not on the\nreal axis; indeed the solution of\n\u2217\ndhQ\n\u03c4 (q\u0303 )\n=0\ndq\u0303 \u2217\n\n(28)\n\nlies here in the complex plane.\nAn interesting property of complex functions is that they have no true maximum. According to\nthe Cauchy-Riemann identities for complex functions, the point q\u0303 \u2217 defined by (28) has the property\nthat there is a path through it called the path of steepest descent, on which hQ\n\u03c4 has a constant\nimaginary part and its real part has a maximum, while along another (orthogonal) path the function\nhas a minimum (also with constant imaginary part); thus q\u0303 \u2217 is a saddle point of hQ\n\u03c4 . The saddle\n\u2217\npoint character of q\u0303 does not interfere with it being the dominant contribution to the integral, as\nlong as we can deform the original line of integration (the real axis) into a contour which overlaps\nwith the path of steepest descent through q\u0303 \u2217 . Furthermore, it can be shown that along this line the\nfunction does not oscillate, so that the point q\u0303 \u2217 truly gives the dominant contribution. Note that\nduring the deformation of the integration contour, the endpoints (\u00b1\u221e on the real axis) must be\nfixed and no singularities of the function must be crossed. The value of integral along this deformed\ncontour is then exactly equal to that of the original integral. To get the saddle point approximation,\n\u2217\n\u2217\none expands the function hQ\n\u03c4 (q) around q\u0303 up to second order in \u03b4 q\u0303 = q\u0303 \u2212 q\u0303 , and integrates along\nthe deformed contour. As \u03c4 increases, the function becomes more peaked around the saddle point,\nand the saddle point expression becomes an increasingly good approximation to the integral.\nTo illustrate this method, let us first apply it to the work distribution, which is simpler than the\nheat distribution and for which the result can be compared with the exact result in Eq. (24). From\nEq. (21) one then obtains\nZ\nW\n\u03c3+ \u03c4 \u221e\nW\ndq\u0303 e\u03c4 h\u03c4 (q\u0303) ,\n(29)\n\u03c0\u03c4 (p) =\n2\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\nwhere\nhW\n\u03c4 (q\u0303) = \u03c3+\n\n(\n\n\"\n\n1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 /\u03c4r\n\u2212iq\u0303p + q\u0303 i \u2212 q\u0303 1 \u2212\n\u03c4 /\u03c4r\n\n!#)\n\n.\n\n(30)\n\n\u2217\nSince this is a quadratic function, the saddle point q\u0303 \u2217 can be obtained analytically from dhW\n\u03c4 /dq\u0303 = 0,\nwith the result\n1\u2212p\n\u0011.\nq\u0303 \u2217 = i \u0010\n(31)\n\u2212\u03c4 /\u03c4r\n2 1 \u2212 1\u2212e\u03c4 /\u03c4r\n\nNote that the saddle point lies on the imaginary axis. Noting also that hW\n\u03c4 (q\u0303) has no singularities as\na function of q\u0303, one can deform the integration contour (i.e. the real axis) to go through q\u0303 \u2217 . Around\n1\nq\u0303 \u2217 the function hW\n\u03c4 has the following behavior:\n\uf8f1\n!\uf8fc\n\uf8f2\n2\n\u2212\u03c4 /\u03c4r \uf8fd\n(1\n\u2212\np)\n1\n\u2212\ne\n\u2217\n\u0010\n\u0011 + \u03b4q\u0303 2 1 \u2212\nhW\n.\n(32)\n\u03c4 (q\u0303 + \u03b4 q\u0303) = \u2212\u03c3+\n\uf8f3 4 1 \u2212 1\u2212e\u2212\u03c4 /\u03c4r\n\uf8fe\n\u03c4 /\u03c4r\n\u03c4 /\u03c4r\n\n1\n\nFor more general forms of h, there would be O(\u03b4 q\u0303 3 ) correction terms.\n\n7\n\n\fFigure 1: Saddle points and paths of steepest deQ\nscent of the functions hW\n\u03c4 (left) and h\u03c4 (right)\nfor \u03c3+ = 1, \u03c4 = 4\u03c4r and p = \u22122 (see text). Solid\ncircles represent saddle points and solid curves\nSA , . . . , SD drawn through these are the paths of\nsteepest descent. For hW\n\u03c4 , shown on the left, only\none saddle point B exists and the (dashed) real\naxis R can be deformed to the indicated path of\nsteepest descent SB going horizontally through\nB, without crossing a singularity. For hQ\n\u03c4 shown\non the right, wiggly lines represent branch cuts,\ntwo singularities appear at \u00b1i, and there are four\nsaddle points A, B, C and D. The path of steepest descent SB through B is the (only) way to\ndeform the real axis to a path of steepest descent without crossing a singularity.\n\nNote that for real \u03b4q\u0303, this expression is real (i.e., non-oscillatory) and has a maximum at \u03b4q\u0303 = 0: the\npath of steepest descent therefore crosses q\u0303 \u2217 parallel to the real axis. Thus we can indeed deform the\noriginal line of integration (the real axis) by shifting the integration contour up or down (depending\non p) until it crosses q\u0303 \u2217 ; this changes the end points \u00b1\u221e, but the integrand vanishes there, so that\nthe integral over the shifted line is still the same as for the original integration line. This is sketched\nin left panel of figure 1.

(24).\nWe now turn to the distribution of heat fluctuations. To find the saddle point in this case, the\nderivative of hQ\n\u03c4 (q\u0303) has to be equal to zero. This derivative is rather complicated, in contrast to the\nsimple linear function that it was for the work functions. To make the expressions in the following\na bit more manageable, let us assume that \u03c4 is so large that e\u2212\u03c4 /\u03c4r may be neglected in Eq. (28)\n(by comparison with numerical methods, we found that this typically leads to accurate results for\n\u03c4 > 3\u03c4r [9]). In that case, hQ\n\u03c4 becomes\n\u001b\n\u001a\n3\n2q\u0303 3\nQ\nlog(1 + q\u0303 2 ).\n(34)\nh\u03c4 (q\u0303) = \u03c3+ \u2212iq\u0303p + q\u0303(i \u2212 q\u0303) +\n\u2212\n(\u03c4 /\u03c4r )(i + q\u0303)\n2\u03c4\nwhile\n\u001b\n\u001a\n2q\u0303 3\n3q\u0303\nd Q\n6q\u0303 2\nh\u03c4 (q\u0303) = \u03c3+ \u2212ip + i \u2212 2q\u0303 +\n+\n.\n\u2212\n2\ndq\u0303\n(\u03c4 /\u03c4r )(i + q\u0303) (\u03c4 /\u03c4r )(i + q\u0303)\n\u03c4 (1 + q\u0303 2 )\n\n(35)\n\nW\nNote that the naive limits \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e of hQ\n\u03c4 in Eq. (34) and h\u03c4 in Eq. (30) coincide. However, the terms\nin Eq. (34) that are then neglected have singularities, which have to be taken into account, because\neven though the factor 1/\u03c4 may tend to zero as \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e, it multiplies an expression that can, because\nof the singularities, go to infinity, making the limit \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e ill-defined.\nThe saddle point equation dhQ\n\u03c4 /dq\u0303 = 0 leads, using Eq. (35), to a fourth order polynomial equation. Such an equation has four solutions; hence there are four saddle points, in contrast to the Fourier\n\n8\n\n\ftransform of the work distribution, which had only one. Which saddle point(s) to use depends on\nhow we can deform the real axis integration contour to include saddle points without crossing any\nsingularities. As Eq. (34) shows, there are singularities at q\u0303 = \u00b1i. The point q\u0303 = i is a branch point\nassociated with the logarithm, while q\u0303 = \u2212i is in addition a simple pole. The structure of the saddle\npoints is shown in the right panel of figure 1. As a function of p, there is only one saddle point that\nwe can reach by deforming the real axis without crossing singularities. This saddle point lies on the\nimaginary axis and is in a sense trapped between the singularities at \u00b1i; this is quite different from\nthe saddle point for the work fluctuations [i.e. i(1 \u2212 p)/2 for large \u03c4 , cf. Eq. (31)] which is unbounded\nas a function of p.\nThe full calculation of the Fourier inverse of P\u0302\u03c4Q would be too detailed for this short paper and\ncan be found in [9]. In an asymptotic expansion for large \u03c4 , the result is\n\uf8f1q 3 3\n\u03c3+ \u03c4 |p+1| \u2212\u03c3 [\u03c4r \u2212\u03c4 p]+3/2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nif p < \u22121.\n\uf8f4q 36\u03c0 e +\n\uf8f2\n2\n16\u03c3+ \u03c4 e\u2212\u03c3+ (1\u2212p) [\u03c4 +2(1\u2212p)/(3\u2212p)\u03c4r ]/4\nQ\n(36)\n\u03c0\u03c4 (p) =\nif \u2212 1 < p < 3.\n3/2\n\u03c0\n\uf8f4\nh[(3\u2212p)(1+p)]\ni\n\u221a\nq\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u03c4\n\uf8f3 \u03c3+ \u03c4 2 /\u03c4r \u2212\u03c3+ (p\u22122)\u03c4 \u2212 8(p\u22123)\u03c4 \u03c4r + 20\u22126p\np\u22123 r\nif p > 3.\n32\u03c0 e\n\nNote that this function has a Gaussian center for \u22121 < p < 3 and exponential tails for p < \u22121 and\np > 3, i.e., for large \u03c4 , one has \u03c0\u03c4 \u223c exp[\u03c3+ \u03c4 p], \u03c0\u03c4 \u223c exp[\u2212\u03c3+ \u03c4 (p \u2212 1)2 /4] and \u03c0\u03c4 \u223c exp[\u2212\u03c3+ \u03c4 (p \u2212 2)]\nfor p < \u22121, \u22121 < p < 3 and p > 3, respectively. Qualitatively, this result can be understood as\nfollows: if p is such that the saddle point q\u0303 \u2217 is relatively far away from the singularities, the function\nand its relevant saddle point resemble those of the work fluctuations, i.e., q\u0303 \u2217 scales linearly with p\nand the Fourier inverse is consequently Gaussian in p. Since for the work fluctuations q\u0303 \u2217 = i(1\u2212 p)/2,\nthe values of p for which q\u0303 \u2217 is not close to the singularities \u00b1i lie within the interval p \u2208 [\u22121, 3]. For\nvalues p > 3, the work saddle point lies below \u2212i, but the heat saddle point has to stay within [\u2212i, i].\nAs a result it is basically stuck just above \u2212i, i.e., q\u0303 \u2217 \u2248 \u2212i, yielding, cf. Eq. (25), an exponential\ndependence of \u03c0\u03c4Q (p) on p. Likewise, for p < \u22121, the heat saddle point is stuck just below i and\nagain an exponential tail of the distribution is present.\nEq. (36) also includes finite \u03c4 effects, obtained using the saddle point approximation. Note that the\napproach to the large \u03c4 behavior has a different character for different values of p. This corresponds\nto the different character of the singularities at \u00b1i (i.e., pole vs. branch point).\n\n5\n\nStationary State Fluctuation Theorems\n\nGiven the distribution functions, one can now investigate whether the stationary state Fluctuation\nTheorem holds. The quantity considered in the Fluctuation Theorems is the fluctuation function\nf\u03c4 (p) = \u03c3+1 \u03c4 log[\u03c0\u03c4 (p)/\u03c0\u03c4 (\u2212p)]. This function measures the asymmetry between positive and negative\nfluctuations in the quantity p. When p represents work, \u03c0\u03c4 (p) = \u03c0\u03c4W (p) and Eq. (24) gives:\np\n.\n(37)\nf\u03c4W (p) =\n1\u2212e\u2212\u03c4 /\u03c4r\n1 \u2212 \u03c4 /\u03c4r\nAs \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e, this tends to p from above (cf. figure 2), hence the Conventional Fluctuation Theorem\n(CFT)is satisfied by the work fluctuations. For these fluctuations, the characteristic time is \u03c4r .\nOn the other hand, considering the heat fluctuations and using Eq. (36), one finds an Extended\nFluctuation Theorem (EFT):\n\uf8f1\n2\n\uf8f4\n3 ln 3\u2212p2 +2p\n\uf8f4\n8p\n3\u2212p \u22122p\n\uf8f4\nif 0 < p < 1\n\uf8f4\n2\u03c3+ \u03c4\n\uf8f2p + (9\u2212p2 )\u03c4 /\u03c4r \u2212\nn\no\n2\n2 +8p\u221210)\n3 (1+p)3 (p\u22121)\nQ\n(1\u2212p)\n(p+1)(\u22122p\n(3\u2212p)\n1\n3\n1\nf\u03c4 (p) = p \u2212\n\u2212 \u03c3+ \u03c4 ln(\u03c3+ \u03c4 ) \u2212 2 ln\n+\n\u22122\nif 1 < p < 3\n576\n4(3\u2212p)\u03c4 /\u03c4r\n\uf8f4\nq4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f32 + 8(p\u22123) \u2212 ln(\u03c4 \u03c3 \u03c4r )\nif p > 3\n2\u03c3+ \u03c4\n\u03c4 /\u03c4r\n9\n\n\fFigure 2: Conventional (CFT) and Extended\nFluctuation Theorem (EFT). W\u03c4 =finite and\nW\u03c4 =\u221e represent the CFT and Q\u03c4 =finite and\nQ\u03c4 =\u221e the EFT for finite and infinite times, respectively. The arrows indicate how the infinite\ntime limit is approached, i.e., for the work fluctuations from above, and for the heat fluctuations from below for small p and from above for\nlarge p.\n\n(38)\nNote that the behavior for negative p can simply be found from the antisymmetry of the function\nf\u03c4Q (p), i.e. f\u03c4Q(\u2212p) = \u2212f\u03c4Q(p).\nTo illustrate the difference between the work and heat fluctuation functions f\u03c4W and f\u03c4Q, we\nsketched these functions as a function of p in figure 2. One sees that in the case \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e, for p < 1,\nthe fluctuation functions tend to a straight line with slope one. This behavior persists beyond p > 1\nfor f\u03c4W , while f\u03c4Q bends down away from the straight line and settles to a plateau value of 2 for p > 3.\nThus, even in the limit \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e, Eq. (38) for heat fluctuations differs from the CFT for work\nfluctuations when p > 1, since the fluctuation function has for heat a plateau at a value of 2 rather\nthan that it increases without bound as for work. Alternatively, one could say that f\u03c4Q does satisfy\nEq. (1), but with p\u2217 = 1, whereas f\u03c4W has p\u2217 = \u221e. We note that for the heat fluctuations there is in\n\u22121\n, which can exceed \u03c4r .\naddition to \u03c4r a relaxation time \u03c3+\nThe plateau value 2 in the EFT for p > 3 (cf. Eq. (38)) is a consequence of the exponential tails\nof the distribution P\u03c4Q . These tails are related to the presence of singularities at \u00b1i, which limit the\nposition of the saddle point q\u0303 \u2217 , such that for p > 3 one has q\u0303 \u2217 \u2248 \u2212i, while for p < \u22121, q\u0303 \u2217 \u2248 +i. As\nthe saddle point gives the dominant contribution to the Fourier inverse, thus leads to the exponential\ntails\n\u03c0\u03c4Q (p) \u223c e\u2212\u03c3+ \u03c4 (p\u22122)\n\u03c0\u03c4Q (p) \u223c e\u03c3+ \u03c4 p\n\nfor p > 3\nfor p < \u22121.\n\n(39)\n\nThe exponential tails directly give f\u03c4Q (P ) = (\u03c3+ \u03c4 )\u22121 ln \u03c0\u03c4Q (p)/\u03c0\u03c4Q (\u2212p)R\u223c 2. Note that conversely,\n\u221e\nexponential tails give rise to singularities in the Fourier transform since \u2212\u221e dp eiqp e\u2212|p| = i/(q + i) \u2212\ni/(q \u2212 i).\n\n6\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe have shown that for a dragged Brownian particle described by a Langevin equation, the work\nfluctuations satisfy the Conventional Fluctuation Theorem, and the heat fluctuations satisfy an\nExtended Fluctuation Theorem. These results may seem to only be peculiarities of this model.\nHowever, these results largely carry over to other more general systems too.\n1. The model of a Brownian particle in a harmonic potential dealt with here can be mapped onto\na system of an electric circuit with a current source [10]. Furthermore, the model can be extended to\nthe Rouse model for a polymer, which consists of a harmonically bound system of Brownian particles.\nIt has been shown that there too the work distribution is Gaussian and satisfies the CFT [15], while\nthe heat fluctuations appear to have exponential tails [16].\n2. Another extension is to consider the non-overdamped case. This has been done in the context\nof work fluctuations by Douarche et al. [17]. While the details of the work fluctuations for finite times\n10\n\n\fcan be quite different, the general conclusion, namely, that the work fluctuations satisfy a CFT, still\nholds. It is hard to imagine that the heat would not satisfy an EFT, since this model is just a more\ndetailed description of the same Brownian system.\n3. Extensions to non-harmonic potentials have been explored as well. Blickle et al. have studied\nthe work fluctuations in [18], while Baiesi et al. [19] have argued for an EFT for heat under some\ngeneral assumptions, one of which is the existence of exponential tails for the distribution of Q\u03c4 .\n4. The limitation p < p\u2217 to the CFT has been found analytically by other authors as well [20,21].\nThe limit is in all these cases also due to singularities in the complex plane of the Fourier transform\nof the distribution, which correspond to exponential tails of the distribution itself.\n5. Turning to deterministic systems, Evans [22] argued that there should be a relation between\nthe FT in such systems and the EFT. Indeed, Gilbert has shown numerically that the EFT holds\nin a Nose-Hoover thermostated Lorentz Gas [23] and [20] explains in a general way why the EFT\nshould hold using a large deviation formalism, but still assuming that there are exponential tails and\nthat the work fluctuations have faster than exponential tails. They also provide a strategy on how to\napply the chaotic hypothesis to singular systems such as Lennard-Jones systems, by using a Poincar\u00e9\nsection that circumvents the singularities in the potential.\n6. A derivation of a general form of the EFT has been given for stochastic systems by Baiesi\net al. [19] and for deterministic systems by Bonetto et al. [20], both based (among others) on the\npresence of exponential tails. They found that universal features in the EFT of the lim\u03c4 \u2192\u221e f\u03c4Q (p)\nare the slope one for p < 1 and the presence of a plateau for large p. On the other hand, the shape\nand extent of the intermediate-p region is not universal, nor is the height of the plateau, unless the\nwork distribution is symmetric around its average, in which case the plateau value is always 2.\n7. Evidence for the EFT has been seen in experiments as well, notably by Garnier and Ciliberto\nin an electric circuit [7].\n8. It has been suggested that the Gallavotti-Cohen Fluctuation Theorem (Eq. (1)), meaning\nthe stationary state Fluctuation Theorem for entropy production, or heat, would not hold near\nequilibrium, but the FT for the \"dissipation function\" of Evans and Searles (which often coincides\nwith work) would [24]. However, it seems that in the appropriate limit \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e, with a restriction\np < p\u2217 , the Gallavotti-Cohen Fluctuation Theorem does hold. Nonetheless, there is a problem in\nobserving the EFT for heat near equilibrium that the CFT for work does not have. As we can see in\nthe exactly solved model of the Brownian particle, the FT for work decays to the correct FT form on\na time scale of O(\u03c4r ) [cf. Eq. (37)]. One the other hand, the heat FT for p < 1 decays to the correct\n\u22121\n) [cf. Eq. (38)]. The latter time scale diverges as \u03c3+ gets smaller, i.e.,\nFT on a time scale of O(\u03c3+\nas one gets closer to equilibrium, whereas the time scale for the work FT (i.e., \u03c4r ) does not. This\nexplains why it is very hard to see the FT for heat in simulations [25].\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by grants from the Department of Energy's Office of Basic Engineering\nunder grant DE-FG-02-88-ER13847 and the National Science Foundations' Mathematics-Physics\nDivision under grant PHY-0501315.\n\nReferences\n[1] D.
