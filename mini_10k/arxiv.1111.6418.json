BLOOM*, L. P. BOS, J.-P. CALVI AND N. LEVENBERG\nAbstract. We update the state of the subject approximately 20 years\nafter the publication of [8]. This report is mostly a survey, with a sprinkling of assorted new results throughout.\n\n1. Introduction.\nLet z0 , ...zn be n + 1 distinct points in the plane and let f be\nQ a function which is defined at these points. The polynomials lj (z) = k6=j (z \u2212\nQ\nzk )/ k6=j (zj \u2212 zk ), j = 0, ..., n, are polynomials of degree n with lj (zk ) =\n\u03b4j,k which we call the fundamental Lagrange interpolating\nPnpolynomials, or\nFLIP's, associated to z0 , ..., zn . The polynomial p(z) = j=0 f (zj )lj (z) is\nthen the unique polynomial of degree at most n satisfying p(zj ) = f (zj ), j =\n0, ..., n; we call it the Lagrange interpolating polynomial, or LIP, associated\nto f, z0 , ..., zn . If \u0393 is a rectifiable Jordan curve such that the points z0 , ..., zn\nare inside \u0393, and f is holomorphic inside and on \u0393, we can estimate the error in our approximation of f by p at points inside \u0393 using the Hermite\nRemainder Formula: for any z inside \u0393,\nZ\n1\n\u03c9(z) f (t)\n(1.1)\nf (z) \u2212 p(z) =\ndt,\n2\u03c0i \u0393 \u03c9(t) (t \u2212 z)\nQ\nwhere \u03c9(z) = nk=0 (z \u2212 zk ). This elementary yet fundamental formula is\nthe key to proving many important results on polynomial approximation\nand interpolation. We first recall the following result of Walsh which gives\na quantitative version of the classical Runge theorem.\nTheorem 1. (Walsh) Let K be a compact subset of the plane such that\nC\\K is connected and has a Green function gK . Let R > 1, and define\nDR := {z \u2208 C : gK (z) < log R}.\nFor f continuous on K, let\n(1.2)\n\ndn (f, K) := inf{||f \u2212 pn ||K : pn polynomial of degree \u2264 n}\n\nwhere ||f \u2212 pn ||K = supz\u2208K |f (z) \u2212 pn (z)|. Then\nlim sup dn (f, K)1/n \u2264 1/R\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nif and only if f is the restriction to K of a function holomorphic in DR .\n*Supported in part by an NSERC of Canada grant.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nT. BLOOM*, L. P. BOS, J.-P. CALVI AND N. LEVENBERG\n\nHere, C\\K has a Green function gK means that gK is continuous and\nsubharmonic in C, harmonic in C\\K with gK (z) \u2212 log |z| bounded as |z| \u2192\n\u221e, and gK = 0 on K. This final condition says that K is a regular compact\nset.\nConsider the following situation. Let {znj }, j = 0, ..., n; n = 1, 2, ...\nbe an array of points. For each f defined in a neighborhood of this array,\nwe can form the sequence of LIP's {Ln f } associated to f . Let \u03c9n (z) :=\nQ\nn\nj=0 (z \u2212znj ). An easy consequence of Theorem 1 and (1.1) is the following.\n\nTheorem 2. Let K \u2282 C be compact and regular with C \\ K connected. Let\n{znj } be an array of points in K. Then for any f which is holomorphic in\na neighborhood of K, we have Ln f \u21d2 f on K (uniform convergence) if and\nonly if\n1\nlim |\u03c9n (z)| n+1 = \u03b4(K) * egK (z)\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nuniformly on compact subsets of C \\ K.\nHere \u03b4(K) is the transfinite diameter of K. In [8], several conditions on\nthe array {znj } were discussed which imply for any f which is holomorphic\nin a neighborhood of K, we have Ln f \u21d2 f on K. The results in this\nunivariate setting are well understood. In Cd , d > 1, knowledge of Lagrange\ninterpolation is less complete. Let Pn denote the complex vector space of\nholomorphic polynomials of degree at most n and let\n\u0013\n\u0012\nn+d\n.\nN = N(n) := dimPn =\nn\nThus\nPn = span{e1 , ..., eN }\n\u03b1(j)\nwhere {ej (z) := z } are the standard basis monomials. We let\nln :=\n\nN\nX\nj=1\n\ndegej =\n\ndnN\n.\nd+1\n\nFor points \u03b61 , ..., \u03b6N \u2208 Cd , define a (generalized) Vandermonde determinant\nof order n as\n(1.3)\n\nV DM(\u03b61 , ..., \u03b6N ) = det[ei (\u03b6j )]i,j=1,...,N\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\ne1 (\u03b61 ) e1 (\u03b62 ) . . . e1 (\u03b6N )\n..\n..\n..\n..\n\uf8fb.\n= det \uf8f0\n.\n.\n.\n.\neN (\u03b61 ) eN (\u03b62 ) . . . eN (\u03b6N )\nGiven N points An = {An1 , ..., AnN } with\nV DM(An1 , ..., AnN ) 6= 0,\n\nwe can form the FLIP's\nV DM(An1 , ..., x, ..., AnN )\nlnj (x) :=\n,\nV DM(An1 , ..., AnN )\n\nj = 1, ..., N.\n\nIn the one (complex) variable case, we get cancellation in this ratio so that\nthe formulas for the FLIP's simplify. In general, we still have lnj (Ani ) = \u03b4ji\n\n\fPOLYNOMIAL INTERPOLATION AND APPROXIMATION IN Cd\n\n3\n\nand lnj \u2208 Pn since lnj is a linear combination of e1 , .., eN . For f defined at\nthe points in An ,\n(1.4)\n\n(Ln f )(x) :=\n\nN\nX\n\nf (Anj )lnj (x)\n\nj=1\n\nis the Lagrange interpolating polynomial (LIP) for f and the points in An .\nIn one variable, V DM(An1 , ..., AnN ) 6= 0 provided the points in An\nare distinct.\nGiven a compact S\nset K \u2282 Cd , we say that K is determinS\ning for Pn if whenever h \u2208 Pn satisfies h = 0 on K, it follows that\nh \u2261 0. For these sets we can find points {An1 , ..., AnN } for each n with\nV DM(An1 , ..., AnN ) 6= 0; we call these points unisolvent of degree n. Despite the lack of a Hermite-type remainder formula, we can describe one\ncondition on an array {Anj }j=1,...,N ; n=1,2,... lying in a compact set K \u2282 Cd\nsatisfying a multivariate version of \"regular with C \\ K connected\" which\nimplies for any f which is holomorphic in a neighborhood of K, we have\nLn f \u21d2 f on K. We call\n\u039bn := sup \u039bn (z) := sup\nz\u2208K\n\nz\u2208K\n\nN\nX\nj=1\n\n|lnj (z)|\n\nthe n-th Lebesgue constant for K, An (the function z \u2192 \u039bn (z) is the n\u2212th\nLebesgue function). It is the norm of the linear operator Ln : C(K) \u2192 Pn \u2282\nC(K) where Ln (f ) = Ln f from (1.4) and we equip C(K) with the uniform\nnorm. The next result follows from a multivariate version of Theorem 1\ntogether with the Lebesgue inequality which says that for every continuous\nfunction f on K we have\n(1.5)\n\n||f \u2212 Ln f ||K \u2264 (1 + \u039bn )dn (f, K)\n\nwith dn (f, K) as in (1.2) using polynomials in Cd .\n\nProposition 3. Let K \u2282 Cd be polynomially convex and L\u2212regular and let\n1/n\nAn \u2282 K satisfy V DM(An1 , ..., AnN ) 6= 0 for each n = 1, 2, ... If lim supn\u2192\u221e \u039bn =\n1, for each f \u2208 C(K),\n1/n\n\nlim sup ||f \u2212 Ln f ||K = lim sup dn (f, K)1/n .\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nThe notions of polynomial convexity and L\u2212regularity will be defined in\nthe next section.\n1/n\nThis property lim supn\u2192\u221e \u039bn = 1 is one of several we consider in the\ndefinition below.\nDefinition 4. Let K be compact. Consider the following four properties\nwhich an array {Anj }j=1,...,N ; n=1,2,... \u2282 K may or may not possess:\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n\n1/n\n\nlimn\u2192\u221e \u039bn = 1;\nlimn\u2192\u221e |V DM(An1 , ..., AnN )|1/ln = \u03b4(K);\nP\nlimn\u2192\u221e N1 N\nj=1 \u03b4Anj = \u03bcK weak-*;\nLn f \u21d2 f on K for each f holomorphic on a neighborhood of K.\n\n\f4\n\nT. BLOOM*, L. P. BOS, J.-P. CALVI AND N. LEVENBERG\n\nHere \u03b4A denotes the unit point mass at A. The probability measure\n\u03bcK is the (pluri-)potential theoretic equilibrium measure of K; i.e., for\n1\nK \u2282 C nonpolar, \u03bcK = 2\u03c0\n\u2206VK\u2217 and for K \u2282 Cd nonpluripolar with d > 1,\n1\n\u03bcK = (2\u03c0)d (ddc VK\u2217 )d , the complex Monge-Amp\u00e8re measure of VK\u2217 (z) :=\nlim sup\u03b6\u2192z VK (\u03b6) where\n[\n1\nlog |p(z)| : p \u2208\nPn , ||p||K \u2264 1}\nVK (z) = sup{\ndeg(p)\n\n= sup{u(z) : u \u2208 L(Cd ) and u \u2264 0 on K}.\nHere L(Cd ) is the set of all plurisubharmonic functions on Cd of logarithmic\ngrowth; i.e., u \u2208 L(Cd ) if u is plurisubharmonic in Cd and u(z) = log |z| +\n0(1) as |z| \u2192 \u221e. In [8] it was shown that for K \u2282 C regular; i.e., VK =\nVK\u2217 = gK , and C \\ K connected, we have the implications\n(1.6)\n\n(1) =\u21d2 (2) =\u21d2 (3) =\u21d2 (4),\n\nwhile none of the reverse implications are necessarily true (although for\narrays lying on the boundary of K, (3) and (4) are equivalent; for a more\nprecise discussion, see [11]). Proposition 3 being true in Cd for any d shows\nthat the implication (1) =\u21d2 (4) remains true in Cd ; and, as was shown in\n[8], (1) =\u21d2 (2) as well.\nWe continue in the next section with the necessary definitions and an\nelaboration on the relationship between conditions (1) and (2). Recent deep\nresults of R. Berman and S. Boucksom ([3] and with Nystrom [4]) yield\nthat (2) =\u21d2 (3); we discuss consequences of this result on recovering the\nmeasure \u03bcK in section 3. In section 4 we describe methods of recovering the\nextremal function VK . We discuss the important Bernstein-Markov property\nin section 5. A brief introduction to weighted pluripotential theory in Cd\nis provided in section 6, and a connection with unweighted pluripotential\ntheory in Cd+1 as in [7] is given. Section 7 provides explicit and semi-explicit\nconstructions of arrays in certain compact sets satisfying conditions related\nto (1)-(4). We give a reprise of the analysis of so-called Bos arrays on the real\nunit disk B2 \u2282 R2 \u2282 C2 in section 8. In section 9, we discuss computational\napproaches to constructing arrays in a compact set K satisfying some of\nthe properties (1)-(4). A brief discussion of Kergin interpolation forms the\ncontent of section 10, and we conclude this work, as was done in [8], with a\nlist of ten open problems.\nWe would like to thank the organizers of the Conference on Several\nComplex Variables on the occasion of Professor J\u00f3zef Siciak's 80th birthday\nfor their hospitality and we dedicate this work to Professor Siciak for his\ncontributions and inspiration to the pluripotential theory community.\n2. Subexponential Lebesgue constants and asymptotic Fekete\narrays.\nWe work in Cd using the same notation as in section 1. For a compact\nsubset K \u2282 Cd let\nVn = Vn (K) :=\n\nmax\n\n\u03b61 ,...,\u03b6N \u2208K\n\n|V DM(\u03b61 , ..., \u03b6N )|.\n\n\fPOLYNOMIAL INTERPOLATION AND APPROXIMATION IN Cd\n\n5\n\nThen\nd+1\n\n\u03b4(K) = \u03b4 1 (K) = lim VndnN\n\n(2.1)\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nis the transfinite diameter of K. Points z1 , ..., zN \u2208 K satisfying Vn =\n|V DM(z1 , ..., zN )| are called n\u2212th order Fekete points for K. The temporary superscript \"1\" refers to a weight w \u2261 1 (see section 6). Zaharjuta [42]\nshowed that the limit exists. Clearly if a compact set K is contained in an\nalgebraic subvariety of Cd then \u03b4(K) = 0. It turns out that for K \u2282 Cd\ncompact, \u03b4(K) = 0 if and only if K is pluripolar [29].\nIf the compact set K \u2282 Cd is L-regular, meaning that VK = VK\u2217 , and for\nR > 1 we define\n(2.2)\n\nDR := {z : VK (z) < log R};\n\nthen we have the Bernstein-Walsh inequality\n|p(z)| \u2264 ||p||K Rdegp ,\n\nz \u2208 DR\n\nfor every polynomial p in Cd . A compact set K \u2282 Cd is polynomially convex\nif K coincides with its polynomial hull\nb := {z \u2208 Cd : |p(z)| \u2264 ||p||K , p polynomial}.\nK\nThen Theorem 1 of Walsh goes over exactly to several complex variables:\n\nTheorem 5 ([36]). Let K be an L-regular, polynomially convex compact set\nin Cd . Let R > 1, and let DR be defined by (2.2). Let f be continuous on\nK. Then\nlim sup dn (f, K)1/n \u2264 1/R\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nif and only if f is the restriction to K of a function holomorphic in DR .\nThe \"only if\" direction is the same for any d and uses the BernsteinWalsh inequality. Theorem 5 immediately yields Proposition 3, showing\nthat for L-regular, polynomially convex compact sets in Cd , condition (1)\nimplies (4). Unless otherwise noted, when discussing conditions (1)\u2013(4) of\nDefinition 4 we will always assume K is L-regular and polynomially convex.\nIt is easy to see that (1) implies (2) but the converse is not true. On pp.\n462-463 in [8], it was observed that for an array {Anj } \u2282 K with\n|V DM(An1 , ..., AnN )| = cn Vn (K)\n\nwhere\n\nn\n0 < cn < 1, lim sup c1/n\n< 1, and lim c1/l\n=1\nn\nn\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nn\n\n(e.g., cn = v for 0 < v < 1), property (2) holds but (1) does not. More\nprecisely, we have the following.\nProposition 6. Let {Anj }j=1,...,N ; n=1,2,... \u2282 K be an array of points. Suppose that\n\u00011/n\nVn (K)\n= 1.\nlim\nn\u2192\u221e |V DM(An1 , ..., AnN )|\nThen (1) holds.\n\n\f6\n\nT. BLOOM*, L. P. BOS, J.-P. CALVI AND N. LEVENBERG\n\nProof. The result follows trivially from the observation that if\nVn (K)\n\u2264 an ,\n|V DM(An1 , ..., AnN )|\nthen \u039bn \u2264 N * an . This observation is a consequence of the fact that each\nFLIP can be written as\nV DM(An1 , ..., z, ..., AnN )\nlnj (z) :=\nV DM(An1 , ..., AnN )\nso that\n|V DM(An1 , ..., z, ..., AnN )|\n|lnj (z)| \u2264 an\n.\nVn (K)\nSince |V DM(An1 , ..., z, ..., AnN )| \u2264 Vn (K) for each z \u2208 K, we have ||lnj ||K \u2264\nan .\n\u0003\n3.

This is the idea\nbehind the classical proof that (2) =\u21d2 (3). In several complex variables,\nthe complex Monge-Amp\u00e8re operator is non-linear and, until recently, no\nreasonable notion of the energy of a measure existed. We state without\nproof the remarkable result of Berman, Boucksom and Nystrom [4] that,\nnevertheless, (2) =\u21d2 (3) for general nonpluripolar compact sets K in the\nmultivariate setting.\nTheorem 7 ([4]). Let K \u2282 Cd be compact and nonpluripolar.

In Proposition\n3.7 of [8] it was shown that for a Leja sequence {x1 , x2 , ...} \u2282 K,\n(d+1)\n\nlim |V DM(x1 , ..., xN )| dnN = \u03b4(K).\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nThus the asymptotic Fekete property (3.1) holds for this sequence of points;\nso from Theorem 7 it follows that the discrete measures\nN\n1 X\n\u03bcn :=\n\u03b4x\nN i=1 i\n\nconverge weak-* to \u03bcK . A Leja sequence is defined S\ninductively as follows.\nTake the standard monomial basis {e1 , e2 , ...} for Pn ordered so that\ndegei \u2264degej if i \u2264 j.

This is the first question in section 5 of [8]. We end\nthis subsection with the statement of a result of R. Taylor and V. Totik\nthat gives a partial answer in the d = 1 setting.\nTheorem 8 ([39]). Let K \u2282 C be compact and assume that the outer\nboundary of K can be written as a finite union of C 2 arcs. Then any Leja\nsequence for K satisfies property (1).\nIn particular, Leja sequences on an interval satisfy property (1). We\nreturn to this topic in section 7.\n4. Recovering the function VK .\nIn section 2.4 of [8], an elementary argument showed that for arrays\nsatisfying property (1) of Definition 4, the Lebesgue functions \u039bn (z) can be\nused to recover VK in the sense that\n(4.1)\n\nlim log \u039bn (z) = VK (z), z \u2208 Cd .\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nThis was proved in the univariate case but the same proof works in all\ndimensions.

In this section,\nwe investigate special families of polynomials which can be used to recover\nthe extremal function VK .\nZaharjuta's proof of the existence of the limit in (2.1) introduced the\nuseful notion of directional Chebyshev constants.

A weighted version of Theorem 9 was proved as Theorem 3.5\nof [13]. We will utilize this in section 6.\n5. Bernstein-Markov property.\nFor a compact set K \u2282 Cd and a measure \u03bd on K, we say that the pair\n(K, \u03bd) satisfies a Bernstein-Markov property if there exist constants {Mn }\n1/n\nwith lim supn\u2192\u221e Mn = 1 and all polynomials Qn \u2208 Pn satisfy\n||Qn ||K \u2264 Mn ||Qn ||L2 (\u03bd) .\nIn [8] it was shown (Theorem 3.3) how one could recover the transfinite\ndiameter \u03b4(K) from asymptotics of Gram determinants associated to a\nBernstein-Markov pair (K, \u03bd). More recently, strong Bergman asymptotics\nwere proved in [4] in this setting: if (K, \u03bd) satisfies a Bernstein-Markov\nproperty, then\n(5.1)\n\n1 \u03bd\nB d\u03bd \u2192 \u03bcK weak-\u2217\nN n\n\nwhere\nBn\u03bd (z)\n\n:=\n\nN\nX\nj=1\n\n|qj (z)|2\n\nis the n\u2212th Bergman function for K, \u03bd and {q1 , q2 , * * * , qN } is an orthonormal basis for Pn with respect to L2 (\u03bd). Thus it is natural to ask which\ncompact sets K admit measures \u03bd satisfying a Bernstein-Markov property.\nThe following result was proved in [15]; since the proof is short, we include\nit.\nProposition 11 ([15]). Let K \u2282 Cd be an arbitrary compact set. Then there\nexists a probability measure \u03bd such that (K, \u03bd) satisfies a Bernstein-Markov\nproperty.\nProof. To construct \u03bd, we first observe that if K is a finite set, any measure\n\u03bd which puts positive mass at each point of K will work.

The second\npart has a negative answer, as the simple example of\nK = {z \u2208 C : |z| \u2264 1} \u222a {2}\n\nshows.\nFor certain measures \u03bd with compact and non-polar support on the real\nline R \u2282 C, pointwise asymptotics of the Bergman functions {Bn\u03bd } are known\n(cf., [40]). In the higher dimensional setting, very little is known. Bos, et al\n[18] consider one natural analogue of the interval, namely, the real unit ball\nBd := {(z1 , ..., zd ) \u2208 Cd : Imzj = 0, j = 1, ..., d;\n\nd\nX\nj=1\n\n(Rezj )2 \u2264 1}\n\n\fPOLYNOMIAL INTERPOLATION AND APPROXIMATION IN Cd\n\n11\n\nin Rd \u2282 Cd .

Lemma 1 in [18] shows that\nif d\u03bd(x) = \u03c9(x)dx where \u03c9(x) = \u03c9(\u2212x) is a positive centrally symmetric\nweight satisfying a certain Lipschitz property, then\n1 \u03bcBd\n\u03c9 0 (x)\nBn (x) =\nn\u2192\u221e N\n\u03c9(x)\n\n(5.3)\n\nlim\n\nand the convergence is uniform on compact subsets of the Rd \u2212interior of\nBd . The first step is the special case where \u03c9(x) = \u03c9 0(x) (note in this case\nthe right-hand-side of (5.3) is the constant function 1; it is also shown that\nthe limit is the constant function 2 on the sphere |x| = 1).\nHaving a Bernstein-Markov measure allows one to replace Chebyshev\npolynomials by orthogonal polynomials in certain asymptotic computations.\nUsing this idea, the exact calculation of the transfinite diameter of the real\nball Bd := {x \u2208 Rd : |x| \u2264 1} and the real unit simplex, S = Sd := {x \u2208\nPd\nd\nd\nRd+ :\nj=1 xj \u2264 1} in R \u2282 C was recently achieved in [9].\nProposition 12 ([9]).

Weighted vs. unweighted.\nIn the weighted theory, one considers closed sets which, for certain weights,\nmay be unbounded. To be precise, let K \u2282 Cd be closed and let w be an\nadmissible weight function on K: w is a nonnegative, usc function with\n{z \u2208 K : w(z) > 0} nonpluripolar; if K is unbounded, we require that w\nsatisfies the growth property\n(6.1)\n\n|z|w(z) \u2192 0 as |z| \u2192 \u221e, z \u2208 K.\n\nLet Q := \u2212 log w and define the weighted extremal function or weighted\n\u2217\npluricomplex Green function VK,Q\n(z) := lim sup\u03b6\u2192z VK,Q (\u03b6) where\nVK,Q(z) := sup{u(z) : u \u2208 L(Cd ), u \u2264 Q on K}.\n\n\f12\n\nT. BLOOM*, L. P. BOS, J.-P. CALVI AND N. LEVENBERG\n\nIn the unbounded case, property (6.1) is equivalent to\nQ(z) \u2212 log |z| \u2192 +\u221e as |z| \u2192 \u221e through points in K.\n\nDue to this growth assumption for Q, VK,Q is well-defined and equals VK\u2229BR ,Q\nfor R > 0 sufficiently large where BR = {z : |z| \u2264 R} (Definition 2.1 and\nLemma 2.2 of Appendix B in [33]). It is known that the support\nSw := supp(\u03bcK,Q)\nof the weighted extremal measure\n\u03bcK,Q :=\n\n1\n\u2217\n(ddc VK,Q\n)d\n(2\u03c0)d\n\nis compact;\nmoreover,\n\n\u2217\nSw \u2282 Sw\u2217 := {z \u2208 K : VK,Q\n(z) \u2265 Q(z)};\n\u2217\nVK,Q\n= Q q.e. on Sw\n\n\u2217\n(i.e., VK,Q\n= Q on Sw \\ F where F is pluripolar); and if u \u2208 L(Cd ) satisfies\n\u2217\nu \u2264 Q q.e. on Sw then u \u2264 VK,Q\non Cd .\nThe unweighted case is when K is compact and w \u2261 1 (Q \u2261 0); we then\nwrite VK := VK,0 to be consistent with the previous notation.\nEven in one variable (d = 1) the weighted theory introduces new phenomena from the unweighted case. As an elementary example, \u03bcK puts no\nmass on the interior of K (in one variable, the support of \u03bcK is the outer\nboundary of K); but this is not necessarily true in the weighted setting.\nAs a simple but illustrative example, taking K to be the closed unit ball\n{z : |z| \u2264 1}\u221aand Q(z) = |z|2 , it is easy to see that V\u221aK,Q = Q on the ball\n{z : |z| \u2264 1/ 2} and VK,Q(z) = log |z| + 1/2 \u2212 log(1/ 2) outside this ball.\nOne can check that if KR is the ball {z : |z| \u2264 R} for 1 \u2264 R \u2264 \u221e and\nQ(z) = |z|2 , one has VKR ,Q = VK,Q.\nNow let K \u2282 Cd be compact and let w be an admissible weight function\non K.

Explicit good interpolation points\n\nAn important question in numerical analysis and computational mathematics is to provide explicit or computable arrays {An } = {Anj , j =\n1, . . . , N} \u2282 K satisfying (4) in Definition 4. By this we mean points whose\nvalues can be entered on a computer with arbitrary precision to evaluate\nLIP's. Typical explicit points in the univariate setting are Chebyshev points\nfor which\n\u001a \u0012\n\u0013\n\u001b\n2k + 1\n{An } = cos\n\u03c0 , k = 0, . . . n , K = [\u22121, 1],\n2(n + 1)\nor the roots of unity for which\n{An } = {exp(2ik\u03c0/(n + 1)), k = 0, . . . , n},\n\nK = {|z| \u2264 1}.\n\nSemi-explicit points, such as Fejer points (the image of a complete set of\nroots of unity under an exterior conformal mapping) or points related to\northogonal polynomials still deserve interest since, in particular cases and\nfor n not too large, they can be computed with high precision. The Fekete\npoints for [\u22121, 1] are extreme points of Legendre polynomials plus {\u22121, 1}.\nRecently Xu [41] constructed semi-explicit points on a region in R2 bounded\nby two lines and a parabola using zeros of Jacobi polynomials. Typical nonexplicit good points are multivariate Fekete points, which cannot currently\nbe efficiently computed. Even in the one variable case, only a few examples\nof explicit good interpolation points are known. If K is not an interval or a\ndisk one generally uses algorithms which provide numerical approximations\nfor the points (cf., section 9).\n\n\fPOLYNOMIAL INTERPOLATION AND APPROXIMATION IN Cd\n\n15\n\nTo clarify what we mean by good points for polynomial interpolation we\nutilize the following hierarchy which slightly refines some conditions listed\nin Definition 4.\nDefinition 14. Let {An } be an array of interpolation points in K \u2282 Cd .\nWe denote by \u039bn the Lebesgue constant for An , K and Ln f the LIP of f, An .\nHere are four properties that {An } may or may not possess:\n(H1) Ln f \u21d2 f on K for each f holomorphic on a neighborhood of K, see\nDefinition 4, (4).\n1/n\n(H2) The Lebesgue constants \u039bn grow sub-exponentially: limn\u2192\u221e \u039bn =\n1, see Definition 4, (1).\n(H3) The Lebesgue constants \u039bn grow polynomially: there exists s \u2208 N\nsuch that \u039bn = O(ns ) as n \u2192 \u221e.\n(H4) The Lebesgue constants \u039bn grow sub-polynomially: \u039bn = o(n) as\nn \u2192 \u221e.\nClearly (H4) =\u21d2 (H3) =\u21d2 (H2) =\u21d2 (H1). None of the reverse\nimplications is true. That there are sequences of points satisfying (H3) but\nnot (H4) and (H2) but not (H3) will follow from the results below. In the\nmultivariate case, since there is currently no analogue to Theorem 2, we\nare left with the last three conditions and are obliged to study multivariate\nLebesgue constants. In the univariate case, we may establish (H1) without\nhaving recourse to Lebesgue constants, e.g., in obtaining a discretization of\nthe equilibrium measure (using (3) =\u21d2 (4) in (1.6)). An array of multivariate Fekete points is a fundamental example satisfying (H3).\nFor theoretical approximation of holomorphic functions on a neighborhood of K, conditions (H4) and (H3) do not provide better results than\n(H2). However, computations with arrays of points having smaller Lebesgue\nconstants benefit from a higher stability and, from the point of view of approximation theory, one can derive convergence results for larger classes of\nfunctions. For instance, from Lebesgue's inequality (1.5) and Jackson's theorem, see e.g. [31, \u00a71.1.2], if K is a product of intervals in Rd \u2282 Cd then\n(H3) implies that Ln f \u21d2 f on K for each f which is (s + 1)-times continuously differentiable on a neighborhood of K while (H4) only requires f\nto be continuously differentiable. In general, conditions (H3) and (H4) imply convergence results for classes of functions f for which dn (f, K) (recall\n(1.2)) is known to decrease polynomially in n. Such estimates are known for\nseveral natural spaces of functions holomorphic on the interior of K with\nsome regularity up to the boundary (cf., [34] and the references therein).\nThe array of Padua points {Pn } is an explicit example of multivariate\ninterpolation points satisfying condition (H4). We follow the presentation\ngiven in [19]. Another point of view can be found in [20]. The points of\nPn lie in K = [\u22121, 1]2 and are located on the classical Lissajous curve\nt \u2208 [0, \u03c0] 7\u2192 \u03b3n (t) := (cos(nt), cos((n + 1)t)). The Padua points are the\ndouble points of this curve together with its points on the (real) boundary\n\n\f16\n\nT. BLOOM*, L. P. BOS, J.-P. CALVI AND N. LEVENBERG\n\nof the square. A simple formula is the following:\n\u001a \u0012\n\u001b\n\u0013\ni\nj\n2\n(7.1)\nPn = \u03b3n\n\u03c0 + \u03c0 : i + j \u2264 n, (i, j) \u2208 N .\nn+1\nn\n\u0001\nIt is readily seen that the above n+2\npoints are pairwise distinct but the\n2\nfact that Pn is a unisolvent set of degree n is not immediate. To see this,\nit suffices to exhibit a FLIP for any point a \u2208 Pn . There is a remarkable\nformula expressing such a FLIP with the help of the reproducing kernel Kn\nfor the inner product based on the tensor product of two arcsine measures,\nZ\n1\n1\n1\np\n(p, q) \u2208 Pn 7\u2192 hp, qi := 2\np(x, y)q(x, y) \u221a\ndxdy\n2\n\u03c0 [\u22121,1]2\n1\u2212x\n1 \u2212 y2\nZ\n1\np(cos(t), cos(s))q(cos(t), cos(s))dtds.\n= 2\n\u03c0 [0,\u03c0]2\n\nThe reproducing kernel Kn is defined on [\u22121, 1]2 via the relation\np(w) = hp, Kn (w ; *)i,\n\np \u2208 Pn ,\n\nw = (x, y) \u2208 [\u22121, 1]2 .\n\nIt can be shown that the FLIP corresponding to a = (xa , ya ) \u2208 Pn is given\nby\nla (x, y) = wa {Kn (a; (x, y)) \u2212 Tn (y)Tn (ya )}\n\nwhere wa is constant and Tn is the ordinary Chebyshev polynomial of degree\nn. The proof uses certain quadrature formulas for the the tensor product of\ntwo arcsine measures using the points of Pn . Next, it can be shown that the\nkernel Kn , hence the FLIP's for Pn , are expressible as a linear combination\nof quotients of classical trigonometric polynomials. A careful analysis leads\nto the following result.\nTheorem 15 ([19]). The Lebesgue constants \u039bn for the Padua points Pn\nand K = [\u22121, 1]2 satisfy\n\u039bn = O(log2 n),\n\nn \u2192 \u221e.\n\nIn particular, Ln f \u21d2 f on K for each f which is continuously differentiable\non a neighborhood of K.\nLagrange interpolants at Padua points can be easily computed, cf., [21,\n22]. Unfortunately, it is not clear what might be the analogues of Padua\npoints in higher dimensions (n > 2).\nWe present another construction of good points based on a different\nidea. These points will only satisfy the weaker condition (H3) but there is a\nsimple and efficient way of going from dimension 1 to dimension k for every\nk. The starting point is a classical algebraic formula giving multivariate\ninterpolation points starting with univariate points. Given d sets of (n + 1)tuples\nAs = (a0s , . . . , ans ) , s = 1, . . . , d\nconsisting of distinct points in C, we intertwine these tuples:\nA1 \u2295 A2 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Ad := {(ai1 1 , ai2 2 , * * * , aid d ) , i1 + i2 + * * * + id \u2264 d} .\n\n\fPOLYNOMIAL INTERPOLATION AND APPROXIMATION IN Cd\n\n17\n\nChanging the ordering of the points would provide a different set of points\nin Cd . The set of points we obtain is unisolvent of degree n in Cd . Such\npoints were studied by Siciak [35] and used in [8, Theorem 4.8] to prove\nthe existence of points satisfying properties (2), (3) and (4) in Definition\n4. We want to construct interpolation points by intertwining well-chosen \u2013\nand well-ordered \u2013 univariate interpolation points which satisfy (H3). The\nobvious strategy is to try to relate the Lebesgue constants of the multivariate\ninterpolations points to the Lebesgue constants of the univariate points.\nSuch a relation is given in the following theorem. For simplicity, we state\nonly the case d = 2.\nTheorem 16 ([23]). Let K be a compact set in C2 containing A1 \u2295 A2 .\nWe let K1 (K2 ) denote the projection of K on the z1 (z2 ) axis. Then\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\nn+2 X\n[i]\n[j]\n\u039bn (A1 \u2295 A2 |K) \u2264 4\n\u039bn A1 |K1 * \u039bn A2 |K2\nn\ni+j\u2264n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n[i]\n[i]\nwhere A1 = (a0 , . . . , ai ) and \u039bn A1 |K1 denotes its Lebesgue constant\nwith respect to the compact set K1 (likewise for A2 [j] ).\n\nIn order to estimate the Lebesgue constant \u039bn (A1 \u2295 A2 |K), bounds on\n\u039bn (A1 |K1 ) and on \u039bn (A2 |K2 ) do not suffice. We must have bounds on the\nLebesgue constants of every subset A1 [i] and A2 [j] for i + j \u2264 n. The only\npractical way of using the theorem is to start with univariate points given\nby a sequence of interpolation points Ans = (a0s , . . . , ans ), so that for every\ni \u2264 n, Ans [i] = Ais . Then the search for good multivariate interpolation points\nvia the intertwining process is reduced to the problem of finding univariate\ninterpolation points given by a sequence and satisfying (H3). Surprisingly,\nsuch sequences did not seem to be known until recently.\nWe now discuss the construction of such univariate sequences. All examples currently available are constructed with the help of Leja sequences for\nthe closed unit disk. Recall that a Leja sequence for a compact set K \u2282 C\nis a sequence {an } in K such that\nmax\nz\u2208K\n\nd\nY\ni=0\n\n|z \u2212 ai | =\n\nd\nY\ni=0\n\n|ad+1 \u2212 ai |,\n\nd \u2265 0.\n\nIf we are to produce explicit points we must restrict to K = D = {|z| \u2264 1}.\nIn this case, the structure of Leja sequences is given by the following result.\nWe always assume that the first term equals 1.\nTheorem 17 ([5]). Leja sequences for the unit disk D satisfy:\n(1) A 2n -Leja section is formed by the 2n -th roots of unity.\n(2) If E2n+1 is a 2n+1 -Leja section then there exist a 2n -th root \u03c1 of \u22121\nand a 2n -Leja section U2n such that E2n+1 = (E2n , \u03c1U2n ).\nUsing this result, the following estimates were recently established.\nTheorem 18 ([25]). Let {ej } be a Leja sequence for D. As n \u2192 \u221e, \u039bn =\nO(n log n) where \u039bn is the Lebesgue constant for {e0 , . . . , en\u22121 }.\n\n\f18\n\nT. BLOOM*, L. P. BOS, J.-P. CALVI AND N. LEVENBERG\n\nA similar estimate holds for the image of Leja sequences under external\nconformal mappings C \\ D \u2192 C \\ K for K sufficiently regular, e.g., K\nbounded by a C 2 Jordan curve [25]. It is also shown in [25] that a Leja\nsequence for D cannot satisfy (H4), thus showing that, in general, (H3)\ndoes not imply (H4).\nFor practical applications, real points are more useful. A simple idea to\nconstruct such points is to project a Leja sequence for D onto the real axis.\nSince a Leja sequence for D is symmetric with respect the real axis, complex\nconjugate points provide the same real point. Eliminating this redundancy\nwe obtain a so-called Re-Leja sequence [26]. One can specify the n-th entry\nof a Re-Leja sequence in terms of the real part of a certain entry of the Leja\nsequence used in its construction.\nTheorem 19 ([26]). Let X = {xj } be a Re-Leja sequence. The Lebesgue\nconstants \u039bn for the points x0 , . . . , xn\u22121 satisfy\n(7.2)\n\n\u039bn = O(n3 log n),\n\nn \u2192 \u221e.\n\nBy combining the above two results and the general version of Theorem\n16 we obtain the following result.\nTheorem 20 ([25, 26]). Intertwining k Leja sequences for D and d \u2212 k ReLeja sequences for [\u22121, 1] yields unisolvent sets on the Cartesian product of\nthese sets in Cd whose Lebesgue constants \u039bn satisfy (H3).\nMoreover, the degree of the polynomial growth of \u039bn can be estimated.\nOne can give an explicit expression for the n-th element of certain simple\nLeja (or Re-Leja) sequences that depend only on the binary expansion of\nthe index n. Details can be found in [25, 26]. In view of Theorems 16 and\n8, the intertwining of Leja sequences for many compact sets provides further examples of multivariate interpolation points satisfying property (H2).\nGoncharov [27] has constructed a sequence in [\u22121, 1] satisfying (H2) but\nnot (H3) by arranging the classical Chebyshev points in a certain manner.\n8. The quest for good points in the real disk\nWe describe a natural strategy for finding good points in the real disk\nB = B2 = {(x, y) \u2208 R2 : x2 + y 2 \u2264 1}. Using Theorem 3.3, one can calculate\nthe transfinite diameter of B to find\n1\n\u03b4(B) = \u221a ;\n2e\nand its equilibrium measure is well-known,\nr\nd\u03bcB = \u221a\ndrd\u03b8\n2\u03c0 1 \u2212 r 2\nin polar coordinates in R2 ; i.e., d\u03bcB is absolutely continuous with respect\nto Lebesgue measure on B with density 2\u03c0\u221a11\u2212r2 .\nIt was shown in [8] that (3) ; (1), (2), (4). The set B was used in construction of Bos arrays satisfying (3) but not (4) (and (3) but not (2)). The\npoints at the n\u2212th stage in a Bos array are formed by taking a union of\n\n\fPOLYNOMIAL INTERPOLATION AND APPROXIMATION IN Cd\n\n19\n\nequally spaced points on concentric circles centered at the origin. Precisely,\nif n = 2s is even, one chooses s + 1 radii Rs0 < * * * < Rss = 1 and 4j + 1\nequally spaced points on the circle of radius Rsj . The Vandermonde determinant |V DM(An1 , ..., AnN )| depends only on the radii Rs0 , * * * , Rss and\nif the asymptotic distribution of the radii on [0, 1] is given by a function\nj\n2\nG : [0, 1] \u2192 [0, 1]; i.e., if G( s+1\n) = Rsj\n, then\n1\n3\nlim |V DM(An1 , ..., AnN )|1/ln = \u221a exp\nn\u2192\u221e\n4L(G)\n2\n\nwhere\nL(G) =\n\nZ\n\n1\n2\n\nx log G(x)dx + 2\n0\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\nZ\n\nx\n\n1\n\nx log[G(y) \u2212 G(x)]dydx.\n\nThus, if one could construct a Bos array with L(G) = \u22122/3, then this array\nwould satisfy (2).\nTaking G(x) = (1 \u2212 cos \u03c0x)/2, the radii distribute asymptotically like\nthe Chebyshev distribution on [0, 1] and this is a necessary condition (see\n[8]) that such an array satisfies (4). We state without proof an interesting\ncalculation.\nLemma 21. For G(x) = (1 \u2212 cos(\u03c0x))/2 = sin2 (\u03c0x/2),\n4\n2\nL(G) = \u2212 log(2) + 2 \u03b6(3) \u2248 \u22120.6806085842 * * *\n3\n\u03c0\nwhere \u03b6(x) is the classical zeta function.\nIn particular with this G, L(G) 6= \u22122/3 so such a Bos array does not satisfy\n(2).\nTaking G(x) = 1 \u2212 (x2 \u2212 1)2 , the arrays satisfy (3): we obtain \u03bcB as the\nlimiting measure. Elementary but nontrivial calculations yield\nLemma 22. For G(x) = 1 \u2212 (x2 \u2212 1)2 ,\n\u221a\n\u221a\n26\nL(G) = \u2212 \u2212 4 log(2) + 4 2 log( 2 + 1) \u2248 \u22120.675675691 * * * .\n9\nThus again, with this G, L(G) 6= \u22122/3 so such a Bos array does not\nsatisfy (2). Indeed, if one could find a Bos array with L(G) = \u22122/3, then,\nby Theorem 7, the array satisfies (3) and hence, a posteriori, G(x) = 1 \u2212\n(x2 \u22121)2 , a contradiction. Thus, unfortunately, Bos arrays on B never satisfy\n(2), giving a negative answer to question 9 of [8].\n9. Algorithms\nIt is clear that one can expect to have lists of explicit good interpolation\npoints only for a very limited class of compact sets, even in the univariate\ncase. If we have to produce good points for a more or less arbitrary compact\nset, one must produce them algorithmically. We now discuss some recent\nwork in this direction.\nIn a series of papers, Bos, Sommariva and Vianello (cf. [38] and with De\nMarchi [17]) have introduced the notion of approximate Fekete points. For\nK \u2282 Cd compact, a basis {P1 , P2 , * * * , PN } for Pn , and a set of M \u2265 N\n\n\f20\n\nT. BLOOM*, L. P. BOS, J.-P. CALVI AND N.

We choose the first point x1 \u2208 {a1 , ..., aM } to maximize kV~ (aj )k2 .\nHaving chosen x1 , x2 , * * * , xk \u2208 {a1 , ..., aM } the (k + 1)st point xk+1 \u2208\n{a1 , ..., aM } is chosen so that the volume generated by the columns V~ (xk+1 )\nand V~ (x1 ), V~ (x2 ), * * * , V~ (xk ) is as large as possible.\nSuppose K is L\u2212regular. If for each n = 1, 2, ... one chooses a set of\nS\n(n)\n(n)\nM(n) \u2265 N points AM (n) = {a1 , ..., aM (n) } of K so that n AM (n) forms\na weakly admissible mesh for K (WAM), then the corresponding array of\napproximate\nS Fekete points satisfies (2) and hence (3) (Theorem 1 of [16]).\nThe mesh n AM (n) is weakly admissible, according to [24], if #AM (n) grows\npolynomially in n and\n||p||K \u2264 Cn ||p||AM (n) for all p \u2208 Pn\nwhere Cn grows polynomially in n. All L\u2212regular compact sets K admit a\nweakly admissible mesh; cf., Theorem 16 of [24]. We remark that a WAM\nis called admissible (AM) if one can take Cn = C, a constant independent\nof n.\nThere is also an algorithmic notion of discrete Leja points; as with approximate FeketeSpoints, constructing discrete Leja points from a weakly\nadmissible mesh n AM (n) gives an array satisfying (2) and hence (3). The\ninterested reader is referred to [17] for details of the algorithm.\n10. Kergin interpolation\nOf the many polynomial interpolation alternatives to Lagrange interpolation, one of the most productive ones utilized for interpolating holomorphic\nfunctions in Cd , d > 1 is Kergin interpolation.\nIn this section, we give a new presentation of Kergin interpolation which\nhighlights its canonical character. We let O(Cd ) denote the space of entire\nfunctions and L(O(Cd ), Pn ) the space of continuous linear maps from O(Cd )\nto Pn .\nTheorem 23. There exists a unique map K,\n(10.1)\n\nK : A = (a0 , . . . , an ) \u2208 (Cd )n+1 \u2212\u2192 K[A] \u2208 L(O(Cd ), Pn ),\n\nsuch that\n(K1) for every f \u2208 O(Cd ), K[A](f )(aj ) = f (aj ), j = 0, ..., n;\n(K2) for every f \u2208 O(Cd ), the map A \u2192 K[A](f ) is continuous;\n(K3) K is coordinate-free.\n\n\fPOLYNOMIAL INTERPOLATION AND APPROXIMATION IN Cd\n\nThe map K is defined by\n(10.2) K[A](f )(x) =\n\nn Z\nX\nk=0\n\nSk\n\nDk f\n\nk\nX\nj=0\n\nti ai\n\n!\n\n21\n\n(x \u2212 a0 , . . . , x \u2212 ak\u22121 )dmk (t),\n\nwhere D k f is the k-th total derivative of f , Sk = {t = (t0 , . . . , tk ) \u2208\nPk\n[0, 1]k+1 :\ni=0 ti = 1} and dmk is Lebesgue measure on Sk .\n\nThat K[A] is coordinate-free means that for every invertible linear map\nm on Cd\nK[A](* \u25e6 m) = K[mA](*) \u25e6 m,\nwhere mA := (m(a0 ), . . . , m(ad )).\nCondition (K1) is relatively weak (e.g., if ai = a for i = 0, . . . , d there is\nonly one condition). We shall see later that, together with (K2) and (K3),\nit implies much stronger properties. The operator K[A] is called the Kergin interpolating operator with respect to A. In contrast with multivariate\nLagrange interpolation, the number of points n + 1 is independent of the\ndimension d of Cd .\n\nProof. We first prove that there exists at most one map\n\u03a0 : A \u2208 (Cd )n+1 \u2192 \u03a0[A] \u2208 L(O(Cd ), Pn )\nsatisfying (K1), (K2) and (K3). Suppose \u03a01 and \u03a02 are two such maps.\nWe prove that for every A \u2208 U := {A \u2208 (Cd )n+1 : al 6= aj for l 6= j} and\nevery f \u2208 O(Cd ), \u03a01 [A](f ) = \u03a02 [A](f ). Since U is dense in (Cd )n+1 and\nA \u2192 \u03a0i [A](f ) is continuous, this suffices to prove our claim.\nWe can reduce the problem as follows. Since \u03a0i [A] is continuous on\nO(Cd ) and the space V spanned by ridge entire functions \u2013 functions of the\nform z 7\u2192 h(h\u03bb, zi), where h \u2208 O(C) and \u03bb \u2208 Cd \u2013 is dense in O(Cd ), it\nsuffices to prove that \u03a01 [A] = \u03a02 [A] on V . Further, since \u03a0i [A] is linear we\nsimply need to prove \u03a01 [A](f ) = \u03a02 [A](f ) for f = h(h\u03bb, *i), with h \u2208 O(C)\nand \u03bb \u2208 Cd , \u03bb 6= 0.\nFixing such an f , let H = {h\u03bb, *i = 0} be the hyperplane orthogonal\nto \u03bb. For \u01eb > 0 we define a linear map m\u01eb by m\u01eb (\u03bb) = \u03bb and m\u01eb |H = \u01ebId\nwhere Id denotes the identity on H. Clearly m\u01eb is invertible. Moreover, since\nm\u01eb x \u2212 x \u2208 H, we have\n(f \u25e6 m\u01eb )(x) = h(h\u03bb, m\u01eb xi) = h(h\u03bb, xi) = f (x).\nSince \u03a0i is coordinate-free, we deduce that\n\u03a0i [A](f ) = \u03a0i [A](f \u25e6 m\u01eb ) = \u03a0i [m\u01eb A](f ) \u25e6 m\u01eb ,\n\n\u01eb > 0.\n\n\u03bb\nWe have m\u01eb (x) \u2192 h\u03bb, xi k\u03bbk\n2 as \u01eb \u2192 0, thus by (K2),\n\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0014\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n(f ) h\u03bb, xi *\n(10.3)\n\u03a0i [A](f )(x) = \u03a0i h\u03bbAi *\nk\u03bbk2\nk\u03bbk2\n\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\nwhere h\u03bbAi * k\u03bbk\n2 = (h\u03bbai i * k\u03bbk2 : i = 0, . . . , n). Since \u03a0i takes values in Pn ,\n(10.3) implies that there exists a univariate polynomial p of degree at most\n\n\f22\n\nT. BLOOM*, L. P. BOS, J.-P. CALVI AND N. LEVENBERG\n\nn depending on f , A and \u03bb such that\n\u03a0i [A](f )(x) = p(h\u03bb, xi).\nWe specialize to the case where the h\u03bb, ai i are distinct. Since the ai themselves are distinct, the set \u0168 of all such \u03bb is dense in Cd . It remains to use\nassumption (K1). We have\nh(h\u03bb, ai i) = f (ai ) = \u03a0i [A](f )(ai ) = p(h\u03bb, ai i),\n\ni = 0, . . . , n.\n\nHence p is a polynomial of degree at most n that interpolates h at these\nn + 1 points, i.e, pn is the LIP of h at these points which we write as\n(10.4)\n\n\u03a0i [A](f ) = L[h\u03bb, a0 i, . . . h\u03bb, an i ; h](h\u03bb, *i),\n\n\u03bb \u2208 \u0168 .\n\nIn particular, \u03a01 [A](f ) = \u03a02 [A](f ). We now use the density of \u0168 and the\ncontinuity of f \u2192 \u03a0i [A](f ) to extend the identity to the case where \u03bb 6\u2208 \u0168 .\nThis finishes the proof of the uniqueness.\nIdentity (10.4) shows that if a map \u03a0 with the required properties exists\nthen it should come as a natural multivariate generalization of one of the\nmany available expressions of univariate Lagrange-Hermite interpolation.\nFormula (10.2) is the natural multivariate version of the classical HermiteGenocchi formula. The proof that this map satisfies the required properties\nis a simple calculation; cf., [30].\n\u0003\nIt is not difficult to show that the map K[A] interpolates in the Hermite\nsense; i.e., if a point a appears k times in A then D j K[A](f )(a) = D j f (a),\nj = 0, . . . , k \u2212 1. Kergin interpolating operators enjoy many interesting\nalgebraic properties including the following.\n(1) K[A] is independent of the ordering of the points in A, and\n(2) K[B] \u25e6 K[A] = K[B] for every B \u2282 A.\nIn Theorem 23, Kergin operators are defined only for entire functions.\nAndersson and Passare [1, 2], showed that Kergin operators KD can actually be defined on O(D) where D is a C-convex domain in Cd , i.e., the\nintersection of D with any complex line is connected and simply connected.\nIn Rd this is simply ordinary convexity if we replace \"complex line\" by \"real\nline.\"\nThere are many results on the approximation of holomorphic functions\nby Kergin polynomials. We offer a brief sample.\nLet K \u2282 D be compact and set Kn := KD [An ] where, for n = 1, 2, 3, . . .,\nAn = [An0 , . . . , Ann ] \u2282 K. For D with C 2 \u2212boundary, Bloom and Calvi\n[10] gave conditions on the array {An }n=1,2,... so that Kn (f ) converges to\nf uniformly on K as n \u2192 \u221e for every function f holomorphic in some\nneighborhood of D. They utilized an integral representation formula for the\nremainder f \u2212 Kn (f ) proved by Andersson and Passare [1].\nMore in line with the ideas in this work, we call an array {An }n=1,2,...\nextremal for a compact set K if Kn (f ) converges to f uniformly on K for\neach f holomorphic in a neighborhood of K. For K \u2282 Rd , Bloom and Calvi\n[11] proved the following striking result.\n\n\fPOLYNOMIAL INTERPOLATION AND APPROXIMATION IN Cd\n\n23\n\nTheorem 24. Let K \u2282 Rd , d \u2265 2, be a compact, convex set with nonempty\ninterior. Then K admits extremal arrays for Kergin interpolation if and\nonly if d = 2 and K is the region bounded by an ellipse.\nThus, for example, the real disk\nB = B2 = {(z1 , z2 ) \u2208 C2 : Imz1 = Imz2 = 0, (Rez1 )2 + (Rez2 )2 \u2264 1}\n\nadmits extremal arrays for Kergin interpolation.\n\n11. Open problems.\nWe conclude with some open questions, a subset of which comes from\n[8].\n(1) Is the converse of Proposition 6 true?\n(2) Does (2) =\u21d2 (4)?\n(3) If an array lies in the Shilov boundary SK of K, does (4) =\u21d2 (3)?\nThe Chebysev-radii Bos array in B2 described in section 8 might\ngive a counterexample.\n(4) Construct an explicit array in the ball B2 in section 8 satisfying (2),\nor, even better, (1).\n(5) Find an example of a compact set K \u2282 Cd , d > 1, for which one\ncan explicitly construct Fekete points.\n(6) Do multivariate Leja sequences satisfy (1)? (4)?\n(7) One can define multivariate weighted Leja sequences; starting with\nany point x1 \u2208 K, having chosen x1 , ..., xm \u2208 K we choose xm+1 \u2208 K\nso that\n|W (x1 , ..., xm , xm+1 )| = max |W (x1 , ..., xm , x)|.\nx\u2208K\n\nDo these yield asymptotic weighted Fekete arrays?\n(8) For K \u2282 Cd compact and L\u2212regular, does there exist c = c(K) > 1\nsuch that Fekete arrays of order cn, n = 1, 2, , form an admissible\nmesh (AM) for K?\n(9) For K \u2282 Cd compact, L\u2212regular, and polynomially convex, if a\ntriangular array satisfies {G\u03b1 } is \u03b8 \u2212 aT for K, is (4) satisfied? Is\nthe converse true? Note if d = 1 this equivalence is (essentially)\nTheorem 2.\n(10) Let K \u2282 Cd , d > 1, be L\u2212regular. If one takes asymptotic Fekete\npoints, can the corresponding polynomials be used to recover the\npluricomplex Green function VK as in Theorem 10?\nReferences\n[1] M. Andersson and M.
