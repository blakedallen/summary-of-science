We show that hadron resonance gas can describe\nthese fluctuations reasonably well if the hadron properties are as calculated on the lattice.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn recent years a lot of progress has been made in understanding the QCD transition at non-zero\ntemperature through lattice calculations (see Refs. [1, 2] for reviews). In particular, fluctuations\nof conserved charges have been studied on the lattice and provided insight on how the relevant\ndegrees of freedom change from hadronic to partonic [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. At low temperatures\nit is expected that hadrons are good degrees of freedom and thermodynamic quantities can be\nwell described by hadron resonance gas. Hadron resonance gas (HRG) turned out to be very\nsuccessful in describing particle abundances produced in heavy ion collisions [11]. It was also\nused to estimate QCD transport coefficients [12] as well as chemical equilibration rates [13]\nclose to the transition temperature. Thermodynamic quantities calculated in lattice QCD with\nrather large quark mass agree well with the HRG model if the masses of the hadrons in the\nmodel are tuned appropriately to match the large quark mass used in lattice calculations [14].\nFurthermore, the ratios of certain fluctuations calculated on the lattice are also in reasonably\ngood agreement with HRG model predictions at low temperatures [15, 16, 10].\nFluctuations of conserved charges are the most suitable quantities to test the validity of HRG\nmodel. They can be defined as derivatives of the pressure with respect to chemical potentials\nand as such appear in the calculations of thermodynamic quantities at finite baryon density\nvia Taylor expansion. The recent lattice calculations performed with p4 and asqtad actions at\nor very close to the physical quark mass [6, 7, 10] gave fluctuations that were quite different\nfrom the results obtained in HRG model. It was pointed out that lattice discretization effects\non the hadron spectrum are responsible for this discrepancy [17]. When taking into account\nthe lattice spacing dependence of the hadron masses in the hadron resonance gas calculations a\ngood agreement between lattice and HRG calculations has been found. Strangeness fluctuations\ncalculated with and stout [8, 9] and HISQ [18] improved staggered fermion actions agree better\nwith the HRG result (see also the discussion in Ref. [19]). This is due to largely reduced\ndiscretization effects in the hadron spectrum for these actions. In Ref. [17] we studied baryon\nnumber and strangeness fluctuations in HRG, where the hadron masses have been modified to\n\n\finclude discretization effects present in lattice calculations. The comparison was done using\nlattice data obtained with asqtad action on N\u03c4 = 6 and 8 lattices. On the other hand, the\nmost detailed lattice study of baryon number, strangeness and electric charge fluctuations and\ncorrelations up to sixth order was performed with p4 action using lattices with temporal extent\nN\u03c4 = 4 and N\u03c4 = 6 [10]. In this contribution we are going to extend our calculations in\nmodified the HRG model to study different fluctuations and compare them with lattice results\nobtained with p4 action on N\u03c4 = 4 and 6 lattices. As mentioned above this is also important\nfor constructing realistic equation of state at finite baryon density for hydrodynamic models,\nsimilarly as this was done for zero baryon density in Ref. [17].\n2. Fluctuations of strangeness, baryon number and electric charge\nDerivatives of the pressure with respect to chemical potentials of conserved charges, e.g. baryon\nnumber (B), electric charge Q and strangeness S at zero chemical potentials can be well\ncalculated in lattice QCD\nn\n\u03c7X\nn =T\n\n\u2202 n p(T, \u03bcB , \u03bcQ , \u03bcS )\n|\u03bcB =\u03bcQ =\u03bcS =0 , X = B, Q, S.\n\u2202\u03bcnX\n\n(1)\n\nThese are related to quadratic and higher order fluctuations of conserved charges \u03c7X\n2 =\n4 i \u2212 3hN 2 i2 )/(V T 3 ) etc.1 Mixed derivatives of the pressure give\nhX 2 i/(V T 3 ), \u03c7X\n=\n(hN\n4\nX\nX\ncorrelations of conserved charges\n2\n\u03c7XY\n11 = T\n\n\u2202 2 p(T, \u03bcB , \u03bcQ , \u03bcS )\n|\u03bcB =\u03bcQ =\u03bcS =0 = hXY i/(V T 3 ), X, Y = B, Q, S.\n\u2202\u03bcX \u2202\u03bcY\n\n(2)\n\nWe have calculated these quantities in HRG with hadron spectrum modified to take into account\nthe lattice artifacts. Unfortunately, there is no detailed calculation of the hadron spectrum with\np4 action. Therefore the lattice spacing and quark mass dependence of the hadron masses was\nevaluated using the formulas derived in Ref. [17] based on asqtad calculations. We expect that\ncutoff dependence of the hadron masses is similar for p4 and asqtad actions, except in the pseudoscalar meson sector. It is known that the quadratic splitting of non-Goldstone pseudo-scalar\nmesons is about two times larger for the p4 action than for the asqtad action [20]. Therefore\nwhen evaluating the contribution of kaons and pions to different quantities we simply doubled\nthe quadratic splittings in the pseudo-scalar meson sector used in Ref. [17]. To get agreement\nbetween lattice results and HRG it turned out to be necessary to modify the masses of excited\nbaryons states. Since the cutoff dependence of the excited baryon masses is not known, it was\nassumed that masses of all excited states up to certain threshold mB\ncut are modified the same\nB\nway as the ground state baryon masses [17]. Values mcut = (1.7 \u2212 2.5)GeV have been considered\nin the previous analysis.\nIn this paper we consider all resonances with mass up to 2.5GeV and use mB\ncut = 1.9GeV\nin all calculations. The quadratic fluctuations of strangeness and electric charge calculated in\nHRG and compared to the p4 lattice results are shown in Fig. 1. The lattice results are well\nbelow the HRG curve obtained with physical hadron masses. This is a general feature for all\nfluctuations. However, taking into account the discretization effects in the hadron spectrum we\nfind a reasonable agreement between HRG and lattice results. In the strange sector discretization\neffects are slightly overestimated in our approach. We also studied quadratic baryon number\nfluctuations and baryon number - strangeness correlations and the corresponding results are\nshown in Fig. 2. The baryon number fluctuations are well described by modified HRG,\nalthough the in the low temperature region cutoff effects are under-predicted for N\u03c4 = 6.

This may imply that the cutoff effects in strange baryon sector are smaller than\nin non-strange baryon sector and are overestimated in our approach. Interestingly, the new\ncalculations with HISQ action also suggest smaller cutoff effects in baryon number-strangeness\nfluctuations compared to baryon number fluctuations [19]. Finally we have considered fourth\norder fluctuations of the electric charge and baryon number. The numerical results are shown\nin Fig. 3. The HRG calculations with the modified hadron masses agree reasonably well with\nthe p4 lattice data. Note, however, that here the deviations from the resonance gas show up at\nsmaller temperatures.\n3.

To resolved this issue a more refined treatment of the cutoff\neffects in the baryon sector is needed.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy under contract DE-AC02-98CH1086\nand by the ExtreMe Matter Institute (EMMI).
