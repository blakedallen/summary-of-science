These ideas are a step forward towards\nthe use of atoms trapped by light as quantum information processors and quantum simulators.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe generation and manipulation of entanglement\nhave been identified as important requirements for quantum teleportation [1], quantum information processing\n[2] and quantum communication [3]. Engineering longranged entangled pairs in optical lattices can also have\nfundamental implications in the context of quantum magnetism. For example, many frustrated spin states such as\nspin liquid states correspond to coherent superpositions\nof spin singlet states [4].\nRecent experiments have made progress towards generating multiparticle entanglement among an ensemble of\natoms confined in optical lattices by using controlled collisions between individual neighboring atoms [5]. However, the generation of long-distance pair entanglement\nin systems with short-range interaction between particles\n(such as optical lattices) is not an easy task. In recent\nproposals long-distance EPR pairs [1] are generated by\nfirst creating an entangled pair of quantum particles in\none location and then physically transporting one member of the pair to another location [6]. However, decoherence during the transport reduces the quality (fidelity) of\nthe entanglement.\nOur approach is based on coherent manipulations of\ntriplet or singlet pairs of ultra-cold atoms loaded in an array of double-well potentials called superlattice [7, 8, 9].\nThese manipulations, applied to isolated double wells,\nwere used for the recent observation of superexchange\ninteractions in optical lattices [10, 11, 12]. Here we generalize these approaches to study the many-body dynamics that arises when coupling between the double wells\nis allowed for. We propose various schemes that result\nin controllable generation of multiparticle entanglement.\nSpecifically, we first discuss a protocol that creates from\na system of spinor bosonic atoms initially prepared as\nan array of triplet (singlet) pairs on neighboring sites,\nan array of long-distance triplet (singlet) pairs across the\nlattice. The method consists of a simple iterative swapping procedure, performed by controlling the double-well\n\nbarrier height (see Fig. 1), which enables parallel generation of long-distance EPR pairs.\nWe find that by combining the iterative swapping procedure with the boundary effects always present in a finite linear chain, one can engineer a state in which each\natom located in the right half of the superlattice is entangled with an atom in the left half. This bipartition\nof the system into its left and right parts exhibits maximal entanglement entropy. Similar procedures have been\nproposed for coherently transporting quantum information [13] and for creating bosonic cooper-like pairs [14]\nin optical lattices. Additionally, we show that the parallel generation of an array of EPR pairs can be useful\nfor efficient implementation of entanglement purification\nschemes [15], which aim to distill the few high-fidelity\nentangled pairs from the numerous low-fidelity ones.\nThe swapping procedure described above is implemented in an array of decoupled double wells. An interesting question that naturally arises is what happens\nwith the state if the double wells are no longer completely\ndecoupled, but instead there exists a finite tunneling between them. The resulting dynamics goes beyond the\nsimple two-particle physics behind the swapping procedure and the experiments which control superexchange\ninteractions [10]. The emerging state is the consequence\nof many-body dynamics of a global interacting Hamiltonian and does not require manipulations on individually\naccessed atoms. This is a promising approach for creating new magnetic phases without explicitly processing a\nquantum-computer protocol. Although we believe that\nthe phenomena we discuss here are very general, to be\nspecific we consider in this paper a one-dimensional chain\nand focus on the coherent evolution of the product state\nof triplets or singlets in each individual double well (Fig.\n1a). These are dimerized states which break translational\nsymmetry. This choice of initial states is motivated by\nthe fact they can be prepared in experiments [10].\nOur analysis shows that the time evolution of the\ntriplet product state leads to the formation of a magnetic\nstate with mixed correlations and a high degree of mul-\n\n\f2\ntiparticle entanglement, where short-range antiferromagnetic and long-range ferromagnetic correlations coexist.\nThis state can be experimentally probed by measuring\nthe singlet-triplet populations [11] and density-density\ncorrelations after time of flight [16]. We also find total\n(partial) restoration of the translational (rotational) symmetry, which suggests that our final state has some type\nof spin liquid character. By this we mean a state with\nstrong intrinsic fluctuations but no broken symmetries\n[4], what may be different from other definitions which\nare based on the topological order of the quantum state\n[17].\nThe time evolution of the initial singlet state also leads\nto the restoration of the translational symmetry and high\nmultiparticle entanglement but in this case we do not\nobserve the strongly mixed correlations. The dynamic\nstate has purely antiferromagnetic character, although\nwith an unusual behavior of long-range correlations.\nThe paper is organized as follows: After introducing\nin Sec. II the formalism and numerical techniques we use\nfor our analysis, in Sec. III we describe the basic Hamiltonian and its possible implementation in the context of\nrecent experiments using optical superlattices. In Sec. IV\nwe present the swapping procedure which we refer to as\na single switch dynamics and in Sec. V we discuss the\nidea of iterative repetition of the switch as a means to\ngenerate long-distance entangled pairs. We also study\npossible ways to experimentally detect such long-range\ncorrelations. In Sec. VI we relax the isolated double-well\nconstraint and allow for a finite coupling between the\ndouble wells. Specifically, we concentrate our analysis on\nthe many-body dynamics that emerges when both the\nintra- and inter-well couplings are equal and study the\ncoherent dynamics starting from both an initially prepared triplet product state and an initially prepared singlet product state. Finally, we present our conclusions in\nSec. VII.\n\nSl of a block of size l located at the edge of the chain.\neven\nodd\nIn the case of an infinite system we define S\u221e\n(S\u221e\n)\nas the entropy of subsystems formed by partitioning the\nchain at an even (odd) bond. While any product state (a\nstate that can be represented as a tensor product of two\npure subsystem states) has zero entanglement entropy,\nmaximally entanglement states at half bipartition have\nentanglement entropy of S = N .\nWe use both numerical and analytic techniques to\nstudy the quantum dynamics. For the numerical treatment we adopt the time-evolving block decimation algorithm (TEBD) for finite [20, 21] and periodic infinite systems [22], which uses a matrix-product state representation and a Suzuki-Trotter decomposition of the evolution\noperator. It retains only states with the lowest weights in\nthe reduced density matrix, keeping the number of states\n\u03c7 (the dimension of the matrices) finite. Consequently,\nthe wave-function of weakly entangled states can be handled efficiently, with the computation times of the order\nof O(\u03c73 N ).\nDuring the time evolution \u03c7 has to be increased in order to reproduce the growing entanglement in the system.\nThe accuracy of the method is estimated by varying both\n\u03c7 and the Suzuki-Trotter slicing [23]. For short and intermediate times the TEBD algorithm allows us to get\nvery precise results, but at the moment when the entanglement entropy exceeds log2 (\u03c7), the matrix-product\nrepresentation becomes no longer accurate. To deal with\nthe evolution over long periods of time (t \u2192 \u221e), we use\nexact diagonalization [24] techniques. Even though these\ntechniques can only deal with systems with small number\nof lattice sites (up to 24 sites) and suffer from recurrence\neffects, they are relevant for realistic setups in 1D experiments [25].\n\nIII.\n\nSETUP AND PROCEDURES\nA.\n\nII.\n\nEffective Hamiltonian\n\nTHE FORMALISM\n\nThe focus of this paper is twofold. On one hand we\nstudy experimentally relevant observables which can be\nused to detect and characterize the dynamics of cold\natoms. On the other hand we analyze properties of entanglement in the system. The propagation and redistribution of entanglement are not only important from the\nquantum-information perspective, but can also help to\nunderstand the quasiparticle dynamics as demonstrated\nrecently [18]. Such properties are best discussed in terms\nof the entanglement entropy which corresponds to the\nvon Neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix with\nrespect to a bipartition into two subsystems [19]. The\nentanglement entropy is defined as S = \u2212tr(\u03c1 log2 (\u03c1)),\nwhere the reduced density matrix \u03c1 = tr|\u03c8(t)ih\u03c8(t)| is\nthe trace over the states of either of the two subsystems. For the one-dimensional systems with open boundary conditions, we will study the entanglement entropy\n\nWe consider a system of 2N ultracold bosonic atoms\nwith two relevant hyperfine states, which we denote as\n\u2191 and \u2193, confined within a double-well superlattice with\nthe filling factor of 1. The latter can be experimentally\nimplemented by superimposing two independent lattices\none with twice the period of the other [9, 10].\nIn the deep barrier regime, the vibrational energy of\neach well, ~\u03c90 , is the largest energy scale in the system and one can restrict the dynamics to the lowest vibrational states. When restricted to the lowest band,\nthere are three relevant energy scales: the intra-well hopping amplitude tin , the inter-well hopping amplitude tout\nand the on-site interaction energy U . In the limit of\nlarge U \u001d tin , tout we are focusing on, the system is\nin the Mott insulating regime and the only populated\nstates are the singly occupied ones. The spin dynamics is described by the following effective Hamiltonian,\nwhich takes into account the coupling between the differ-\n\n\f3\nent singly occupied states by virtual particle-hole excitations [10, 26, 27],\nH ef f = \u2212J1\n\nX\n\nS2j * S2j+1 \u2212 J2\n\nX\n\nj\n\nS2j+1 * S2j+2 , (1)\n\nj\n\nwith J1 = 4t2in /U and J2 = 4t2out /U . Since experimentally tin and tout can be controlled independently [11] by\nadjusting the intensities of the laser beams that generate\nthe superlattice, we will assume that both J1 and J2 can,\nin general, be time-dependent functions J1 (t), J2 (t). Additionally, we note that even though for bosons the sign\nof the coupling constants is normally positive (ferromagnetic interactions), experimentally it is also possible to\nchange the sign to be negative [10].\n\nB.\n\nInitial state\n\nThe starting point of our analysis is a system initially\nprepared in an array of triplet pairs on the neighboring\nsites of a double-well superlattice,\n|\u03c8(t = 0)i =\n\nY\n\n|tz2j,2j+1 i ,\n\n(2)\n\nj\n\n1\n|tzj,j+1 i = \u221a (| \u2191ij | \u2193ij+1 + | \u2193ij | \u2191ij+1 ) .\n2\n\n(3)\n\nThis state has been recently realized in the laboratory\n[10]. In this experiment, after first preparing a Mott\ninsulator with two bosonic atoms per double well, the\natoms were transferred into a triplet state configuration\nby using spin-changing collisions [28].\nFor the following, it is convenient to characterize the\ninitial state as a triplet valence bond state of length 1.\nAlthough this state is a ground state of the system of\nindependent wells, it is not an eigenstate of a system of\ncoupled wells. Therefore, changing the couplings J1,2 at\nt > 0 leads to a complicated correlated dynamics. The\nspecific time evolution depends significantly on the ratio\nof the couplings J1 and J2 .\n\nC.\n\nSwitching procedures\n\nWe consider and characterize in details three specific\ncases:\n1. Single switch: J1 [t > 0] = 0, J2 [t > 0] = J.\n2. Periodic switch: J1 [(2n + 1)ts > t > 2nts ] =\n0, J2 [(2n + 1)ts > t > 2nts ] = J while J1 [(2n +\n2)ts > t > (2n + 1)ts ] = J, J2 [(2n + 2)ts > t >\n(2n + 1)ts ] = 0 with n = 0, 1, 2, . . . and switching\ntime ts specified below.\n3. Homogeneous switch: J1 [t > 0] = J2 [t > 0] = J.\n\nFIG. 1: a) The initial state in the superlattice corresponds\nto a product of triplets at adjacent sites. a is the lattice spacing. b) At time t = 0+ the intra-well tunneling is suppressed\nand the inter-well tunneling is allowed. c) At t = ts the entanglement between adjacent pairs is redistributed between\npairs of length 3. d) If the switching procedure is repeated,\nthe entanglement propagates to atoms separated by 5 wells\nand after n switches by 2n + 1 wells.\n\nThe Hamiltonian in the first two cases consists of decoupled double wells and allows a simple analytical treatment (Sections IV,V). The homogeneous switch involves\nthe complicated many-body dynamics of the Heisenberg\nchain and will be analyzed using numerical tools (Section VI).\nIt is convenient to introduce the bond operators [29]\nwhich create singlet and triplet pairs at different bonds:\n1\n\u015d\u2020j,j+1 |0i = |sj,j+1 i = \u221a (| \u2191ij | \u2193ij+1 \u2212 | \u2193ij | \u2191ij+1 ) ,\n2\nz\nt\u0302z\u2020\n|0i\n=\n|t\ni\n,\n(4)\nj,j+1\nj,j+1\n1\nx\nt\u0302x\u2020\nj,j+1 |0i = |tj,j+1 i = \u221a (| \u2191ij | \u2191ij+1 \u2212 | \u2193ij | \u2193ij+1 ) ,\n2\ni\ny\u2020\ny\nt\u0302j,j+1 |0i = |tj,j+1 i = \u221a (| \u2191ij | \u2191ij+1 + | \u2193ij | \u2193ij+1 )\n2\n(|0i denotes the state with no atoms).

It is given by\n\n6\n\nS\n\nentanglement entropy\n\nwhich follows from the completeness of the Hilbert space\nof states of an individual double well. We start our analysis by studying the single switch dynamics.\n\n5\n\nwhere P2j+1,2j+2 = (1/2) + 2S2j+1 * S2j+2 is the swap\noperator (interchanges the spins) at sites 2j + 1, 2j + 2\nand A is an irrelevant phase factor equal to \u2212J(N +\n2)/(4~).

(2); however, this does not happen. On the contrary, as a result of the evolution under the swap operators, atoms separated by four lattice sites become now\nconnected by triplet valence bonds and so, at the time\nt = 2ts , the state evolves into a valence bond state with\nFIG. 3: The noise correlations for two periods in the single switch, ts = \u03c0~/J.

While the first term in Eq. (12) reproduces the interference peaks at reciprocal lattice vectors characteristic of the Mott insulator state (due to the bunching\nof the bosons), the second term \u2206(q, tR ) provides additional information about the spin order in the system.\nFor example, if the system is released exactly at times\ntR = nts when it is in a valence bond state of length l\n(here l = 1, 3), \u2206(q, tR ) will exhibit spatial oscillations\nwith periodicity dictated by the distance between the entangled atoms (see Fig. 3)\n\u2206(q, tR = nts ) =\n\n1\n[1 + cos(qal)] .\n4N\n\n(13)\n\nWe note that the factor N in the denominator originates from the short-range character of the interactions\nand therefore the entanglement is only shared between\npairs.

However, the 1/N factor should not be a\nproblem in current 1D systems with approximately 20\natoms per tube [25].\n\nFIG. 4: The noise correlations during the periodic switch,\nts = \u03c0~/J. a) TEBD Simulation in the limit N \u2192 \u221e.

The pair is then reflected and continues moving through the lattice with its\nlength remaining unchanged. Consequently, when after\nN \u2212 1 switches the pair initially located at the center\nof the lattice reaches the boundary, a particular state\nthat has the maximal possible length of entangled pairs\nis formed. While for an odd number of double wells it\ncorresponds to a state with an EPR-pair connecting the\nedges of the chain,\n(N \u22121)/2\n\n|\u03c8t=ts (N \u22121) i =\n\n|tz0,2N \u22121 i\n\nY\n\n|tz2j\u22121,2N \u22122j\u22121 i|tz2j,2N \u22122j i,\n\nj=1\n\nfor even N the maximal length of entangled pairs is l =\n2N \u2212 1,\n(N \u22122)/2\n\n|\u03c8t=ts (N \u22121) i =\n\nY\n\n|tz2j,2N \u22122j\u22122 i|tz2j+1,2N \u22122j\u22121 i .\n\nj=0\n\nSince the entanglement entropy of the state partitioned\ninto its left and right half is simply given by the number of EPR-pairs connecting the two parts [30], the\nstate |\u03c8t=ts (N \u22121) i has maximal entanglement entropy\nSN = N . This growth of the entanglement for the case\n2N = 10 is depicted in Fig. 2.\nB.\n\nImplementation of remote entanglement\nprotocol\n\nAs we have seen, by applying the iterative swapping\nprocedure to an open chain it is possible to engineer a\nstate which has maximally separated entangled atoms\nand largest bipartite entanglement. Such a state can\nhave relevant application in lattice-based quantum information proposals due to its large persistency of entanglement because in this case N qubits have to be measured\nto disentangle the state. The persistency of entanglement\nquantifies the robustness of the entanglement to noise.\nWe remark that in this respect a cat state (macroscopic\nquantum superposition state e.g. \u221a12 (| \u2191\u2191 . . . \u2191\u2191i + | \u2193\u2193\n. . . \u2193\u2193i) ) is fragile as even a single local measurement is\nsufficient to reduce it to a product state. The state we\nare engineering has persistency of entanglement as large\nas that of a cluster state, which is one of the key prerequisites for using it as a one-way quantum computer\nresource [31].\n\nMoreover, the |\u03c8t=ts (N \u22121) i state is an eigenstate of the\nN -th switching operator, |\u03c8t=(N \u22121)ts i = |\u03c8t=N ts i and\nthus after 2N switches the state will be rolled back to\nthe initial nearest-neighbor triplet-product state. This\nproperty can be useful for experimentally probing the\nstate and quantifying the fidelity of the procedure. For\nexample, by measuring the quality of the triplet product\nstate after 2N switches one can get information about\nerrors that occurred during the swapping process.\nWe also note that even though we focused on the\ncase of an initial array of triplet pairs, similar considerations hold if instead of triplets one starts with singlets or\nchanges the sign of the coupling constants (as it would\nbe in the case of fermions).\nIn addition, our swapping procedure can also be used\nfor transporting a particular state of an atom without directly moving the particles: If we initially prepare all the\natoms in the same state, say \u2193, except for the atom at site\ni which we prepare in state \u2191, after n periodic switches\nthe state \u2191 will be transferred to the atom located at site\ni + n.\nThe long-range entanglement produced by the switching procedure can be experimentally probed by noisecorrelation measurements. Although for finite lattices\nthe expected ideal pattern of well-defined peaks at t =\nnts (see Eq. (12)) changes to one with less regular structure due to the distribution of different valence bond\nlengths, Fig. 4 shows that it still contains relevant information such as the formation of well-defined peaks at\nq = 0 and q = \u03c0/a when the distance between entangled\natoms becomes maximal.\n\nC.\n\nNon-ideal conditions\n\nUp to this point we have assumed that Eq. (1) accurately describes the many-body dynamics. However,\ndefects such as holes or doubly occupied sites will make\nthis assumption invalid.\nWe should emphasize that there is one particular condition which makes the entanglement generation possible despite the presence of holes. Namely, this occurs\nwhen the single-particle tunneling time is engineered to\nbe commensurate with ts . However, if this condition is\nnot satisfied, in general the holes will hinder the generation of long-distance entangled pairs and they should\nbe suppressed for example by implementing additional\nfiltering schemes such as the one proposed in Ref. [32].\nAdditionally, even though Eq. (1) was derived by taking into account only virtual particle-hole excitations,\nreal particle-hole excitations will certainly take place during the dynamical evolution. They would lead to oscillations on top of the effective Hamiltonian dynamics with\namplitude J/U and periodicity \u223c h/U . Therefore, in order to efficiently average them out one has to work in\nthe strongly correlated regime, i.e. with the condition\ntin,out \u001c U , though this implies smaller time scales for\nthe dynamical evolution. In typical experiments, work-\n\n\f7\ning in a parameter regime where particle-hole excitation\neffects are negligible requires a superexchange coupling\nJ/h of the order of 1 kHz (ts \u223c 1 ms) and thus for a system with approximately 20 lattice sites, it will take about\n10 ms to generate entanglement between the atoms at the\nedges of the cloud.\nAnother aspect of our procedure is that the longdistance entangled pairs are generated by switching the\ninteractions at specific moments of time. In practice however one always expects switching time uncertainties \u03b4t\nand therefore the interval between consecutive steps will\nnot be exactly ts but ts + \u03b4t. Such inaccuracies will accumulate and will degrade the quality of the final state\nexponentially with the number of lattice sites and the\nnumber of switches made during the process. Defining\nideal 2\nthe fidelity of a state as F = |h\u03c8t=nts |\u03c8t=nt\ni| , where\ns\nideal\n|\u03c8t=nts i and |\u03c8t=nts i are the ideal and actual states generated after n iterations, one can estimate the degradation of fidelity using Eq.

Starting from a large ensemble of generated low-fidelity entangled pairs, these\nprotocols distill a smaller sub-ensemble which has sufficiently high fidelity. Entanglement purification can\nbe implemented in a spin-dependent 2D superlattice\nas follows: after creating an array of 1D independent\nchains along x-direction by suppressing tunneling along\ny-direction, one can use our procedure to generate many\nparallel long-distance entangled pairs within the 1D\nchains, i.e. an atom at the site (i, j) will be entangled\nwith one at (i+l, j). Then tunneling along the x-direction\nshould be inhibited and the following iterative procedures\nbe applied:\n1. Lower the intra-well barriers along the y-direction\nof a spin-dependent superlattice, allowing only one\nof the species to tunnelP\n[33]. This will introduce\n0 z\nz\nIsing-type interactions\nj J Si,2j Si,2j+1 between\natoms at adjacent sites along y-axis and therefore\nwill couple entangled pairs at (i, 2j) - (i+l, 2j) with\npairs at (i, 2j + 1) - (i + l, 2j + 1) respectively.\n2. Combine the Ising interaction with single-particle\nrotations, realized with the help of external magnetic fields, to implement the C-Not gate required\nfor the purification schemes described in Ref. [19].\n3. Measure the spins at the (i, 2j) and (i + l, 2j) wells.\nIf they turn out to be parallel, keep the correspond-\n\ning pair at (i, 2j + 1) and (i + l, 2j + 1), otherwise\ndiscard it.\n4. Release the measured atoms and merge the (i, 2j)\nand (i, 2j + 1) wells into a single one. Repetition of\nthe above protocol will distill from the low-fidelity\npairs the ones with higher fidelity.\nLet us now briefly discuss the experimental realizability of such purification protocols. To date, one of the\nmain problems is the experimental implementation of\nstep 3 due to the difficulty of measuring individual states\nat adjacent lattice sites. These atoms are separated by a\ndistance of the order of an optical wavelength and therefore diffraction fundamentally limits individual addressability. One advantage of our scheme is that the atoms\nin a pair that should be measured are in general separated by many lattice sites, but nevertheless when the\nmeasurement is performed on one of the pairs, nearest\nneighbor atoms are still affected. One possibility to overcome this problem has been proposed recently in Ref. [34]\nwhere the use of nonlinear atomic response has been\nsuggested for coherent optical far-field manipulation of\nquantum systems with resolution of up to a few nanometers. The implementation of the proposals of this kind\nin the controlled lattice environment may allow proof-ofprinciple experimental demonstration of quantum purification ideas.\n\nVI.\n\nHOMOGENEOUS SWITCH\n\nAn interesting question which arises from the dynamics\nof the periodic switch is what happens with the quantum\nstate if the double wells are no longer decoupled completely, but instead there exists a finite tunneling between\nthem. One expects that in this case the propagation of\nvalence bond states will be suppressed after some period\nof evolution. To address this question, in this section we\nconsider the case of a homogeneous switch J1 /J2 = 1\n(case (3) in our classification), which formally can be\nconsidered as a particular case of quench dynamics: we\nprepare the system in a ground state of one Hamiltonian\n\u2013 a triplet (singlet) product state \u2013 and then suddenly\nchange the quantum Hamiltonian to a new one \u2013 the\nisotropic ferromagnetic Heisenberg Hamiltonian \u2013, which\ndetermines the subsequent evolution.\nIn contrast to the periodic switch evolution, whose\ngeneral characteristics are independent of the singlet or\ntriplet nature of the starting state, the dynamics of the\nhomogeneous switch is strongly affected by the symmetries of the initial state. Consequently, we consider the\ncases when the initial state is in a triplet (singlet) configuration separately. However, before starting the discussion we first provide a general overview of the dynamics\nof quantum quenched systems.\n\n\f8\nA.\n\nQuantum quench: general discussion\n\nThe time evolution of a quantum state after a quantum quench has recently attracted a lot of theoretical\n[18, 35, 36] and experimental [25, 37, 38, 39] interest,\nin part due to the possibility of varying in real time\nthe parameters of the optical lattice. For example, lowdimensional systems prepared in a gapless state and subsequently quenched into an insulator state have been experimentally studied, addressing questions such as relaxation to thermal states and collapse and revival effects. The dynamics of exactly solvable models, e.g.\nan Ising chain [40, 41, 42], have also been the topic\nof investigation due to the fact that these systems satisfy many conservation laws which lead to non-trivial\nequilibration phenomena. Such behavior has been attempted to be explained in terms of a generalized Gibbs\nensemble [43]. From the numerical side, recent advances\nin time-dependent density matrix renormalization group\n(DMRG) and TEBD methods [20, 21, 44] have allowed\nto study the quantum dynamics in bosonic and fermionic\n1D systems [45, 46, 47]. The numerical simulations seem\nto support the absence of thermalization, however, these\nmethods are restricted to small and intermediate time\nscales. The case of the quench from the gapped phase into\nthe critical regime has been studied using conformal field\ntheory by P. Calabrese and J. Cardy [18, 35]. Numerical\ncalculations [47, 48] support their results. The quench\ndynamics between gapped states can also be attacked\nusing methods of exact solutions [49] and also demonstrate interesting dynamics associated with the absence\nof thermalization. On the other hand, more conventional\napproaches based on perturbative methods [50] and diagrammatic expansions [51, 52] inevitably show dynamics\nassociated with thermalization scenario.\nIn the present work we adopt a numerical approach to\ndeal with the quantum quench dynamics and postpone\nthe analytical treatment for future publications.\n\nB.\n\nInitially prepared triplet state\n\nLet us first consider the case of the homogeneous\nswitch dynamics when the initial state is a product of\ntriplet states (Eq. (2)). In order to gain a general understanding of this system, we note that while the initial state has broken rotational and translational symmetries, the Hamiltonian at t > 0 (ferromagnetic Heisenberg) possesses both of these symmetries. Although its\nlow-energy excitations are dominated by the spin-wave\nGoldstone modes corresponding to the broken continuous\n(rotational) symmetry, the quantum dynamics involves a\nbunch of highly excited modes which know nothing about\nthe spontaneous breakdown of the continuous symmetry.\nWe therefore face a dynamical competition between the\ninitial state with broken symmetries associated with the\ninitial condition on the one hand, and the whole spectrum reflecting both of these symmetries on the other.\n\nAs a result of this competition we expect the emergence\nof a complex magnetic state and the growth of the entanglement entropy.\nAs we have pointed out, for the correct description of\nquantum dynamics it is not sufficient to rely on a lowenergy effective theory because the details of the spectrum can play a significant role. On the other hand,\nif we start with a state which involves many excited\nstates, the characteristic features of the dispersion relation of the low-energy modes can be not so important.\nAlso, quantities studied below are invariant under timeinversion symmetry and therefore the dynamics of our\nproblem should have the same common features as that\nof the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model. As a result,\nsome common mechanisms should define the generic features of the quantum dynamics of these models. It has\nbeen pointed out recently [18, 35] that this generic behavior can be understood in terms of classically moving\nquasiparticles [18, 36], whose transport correlations are\nbounded by the light cone (horizon effect). We interpret\nour results on the basis of these ideas.\n\n1.\n\nEntanglement\n\nWe first focus on the evolution of the entanglement.\nThe spatially anisotropic and weakly entangled initial\nstate evolves into a highly entangled state with restored\ntranslational symmetry. This behavior is signaled by the\ngrowth of the entanglement entropy and the rapid decay of the oscillations between even and odd bipartitions.\nIn Fig. 5 we plot the entanglement entropy of blocks of\ndifferent sizes in a finite lattice. The plot shows that\nfor short times, after the recovery of translational invariance, the finite-block entanglement entropy exhibits\nlinear growth. A saturation to a value close to the maximal Sl = l occurs for longer times. This is in agreement\nwith results obtained with the use of conformal field theory [18] that predict a saturation value proportional to l.\nThe growth of the entanglement limits the applicability\nof the numerical method (TEBD), as reasonable matrix\ndimensions (e.g. \u03c7 = 1000) are only valid for weakly\nentangled systems (Sl \u2264 log2 (\u03c7) \u223c 10). Consequently,\nit is impossible to verify the exact behavior of the entropy for large blocks. However, since in the intermediate time regime the dynamically evolved state in finite\nlattices does not show significantly lower entanglement\ncompared to an infinite system, to study this regime one\ncan make simulations directly in the infinitely extended\nperiodic system, where the translational symmetry can\nbe exploited. This allows to reduce the computational\ncost by a factor of N compared to the finite-lattice simulations [22].\nWe study the crossover that takes place from the\n'linear'-growth regime where Sl = S\u221e (S\u221e stands for\neven\nodd\nS\u221e\n, S\u221e\n, for even and odd l respectively), to a saturation towards a constant value.

The reason for\nthis is that in a one-dimensional lattice model the sharp\ncrossover is smeared out by lattice effects (which explain\nwhy Sl < S\u221e even for t < l/vs ) and, more importantly,\nby the non-linear dispersion relation. Due to the latter,\nparticles moving slower than vs have to be taken into account, what results in a slower saturation of Sl (t) to a\nconstant value at t > t\u2217 .\nWhile long-range effects at the 'horizon' are determined by the 'fast' spin waves and the results from conformal field theory are applicable, the slow quasi-particles\nwill be of great importance for understanding the effects\nrelated to short-range phenomena.\n\n(16)\n\nThis crossover is a direct manifestation of the horizon\neffect. In the case of conformal invariance, where relativistic dispersion relation \u03c9k = v|k| is assumed, the distance between entangled atoms is always smaller than\n2vt. The entanglement grows linearly as long as the\nhorizon is smaller than the size of the block. For the\nopen chain considered here, with the block situated at\none of the edges, the horizon has to be twice as large as\nthe block length [48]. This allows to define a crossover\ntime t\u2217 = l/v when Sl [t > t\u2217 ] becomes a constant [18].\nFig. 5 shows that using the spin-wave velocity of the\nHeisenberg ferromagnet, vs = J\u03c0/2~, the crossover indeed takes place around t\u2217 = l/vs . However, comparing\nresults of Fig. 5 with the results of the quantum quench\nin the XXZ-chain [48], we find that the crossover in our\n\nSinglet-triplet population\n\nTo study further the dynamical relaxation and the\nrecovery of broken symmetries, we plot in Fig. 6 the\nsinglet-triplet population at adjacent sites (j, j + 1). The\ndata are obtained by using an unbiased exact diagonalization technique (Lanczos algorithm [24]) on an open\nchain with 2N = 22 sites. After a certain time interval\ntrelax one expects that the quenched initial values decay into a quasistationary regime, which is destroyed at\nt > trec = 4N/2vs due to quantum recurrence, when the\nedges of the expanding light cone begin to interfere [36].\nFrom Fig. 6 we determine that vs trelax \u2248 5; the value\nvs trec = 22 corresponds to a conservative lower bound of\nthe recurrence time. In the quasistationary regime only\noscillations around an average value are observed. These\noscillations can be associated with the finite bandwidth\nof quasiparticle energies [35]. We define average values\nfor an arbitrary operator O in the quasistationary state\n\n\f10\nas follows:\nhOiqs\n\n1\n=\ntrec \u2212 trelax\n\nZ\n\ntrec\n\ndthO(t)i .\n\n(17)\n\ntrelax\n\nComparing the x, y, z-triplet populations, we see a tendency of relaxation towards proximate values:\nhtzeven iqs\nhtzodd iqs\nhtx,y\neven iqs\nhtx,y\nodd iqs\n\n= 0.334 ,\n= 0.343 ,\n= 0.267 ,\n= 0.272 .\n\nThe relaxation of the singlet-triplet occupation numbers\nat even and odd bonds towards the same quasistationary\nvalues indicates the restoration of the translational symmetry, also suggested by the entropy calculations. The\ndifference between tz and tx,y of about 0.06 implies that\nthe rotational symmetry is not completely restored. This\ndifference is stable for various lattice sizes and choices of\ntrelax (which by definition allows a certain freedom in its\nchoice). This is a direct indication of missing thermalization in the quasistationary regime. The dynamic state\ndoes not fully reflect the symmetries of the Hamiltonian.\n\n3.\n\nStructure factor\n\nIn Fig. 7 we plot the 'time-dependent' structure factor\n\u2206(q, t), which is experimentally accessible by measuring\nthe noise correlations (12). Alongside the persisting peak\nat q = 0, the picture shows the formation of a smooth\npeak at q \u223c \u03c0/3a for all times t > t\u2217 , which signals the\ndevelopment of an unusual type of magnetic state. We\nchecked that for small lattices (2N = 20) the peak is\nstable for vs t < 100. The height of the peak N \u2206(q, t) is\nindependent of the lattice size or the type of boundary\ncondition, thus revealing the short-range nature of spatial\ncorrelations in the system.\nIn order to explicitly study the relaxation of the correlation functions and to understand the origin of the\nincommensurate peak in the noise correlations, we plot\nin Fig. 8 the real-space correlation function\nX\nG+\u2212 (l, t) =\nRehSi+ (t)Sj\u2212 (t)i\n(18)\n|i\u2212j|=l\n\nand the quantity\n+\u2212\n\nQ\n\n(l, t) =\n\nFIG. 7: The noise correlations for the infinite lattice, TEBD\nsimulation, vs = J\u03c0/2~.

This is the origin of the incommensurate peak in\nthe noise correlations (Fig. 7). The large-distance properties of the correlation function do not contradict the predictions of conformal field theory [35]. For instance, the\ncorrelations are ferromagnetic and change from their initial values only when the 'horizon' of quasiparticle pairs\nl(t) = 2vs t passes, although in this case we find that the\nhorizon is not absolutely sharp. It is important to notice\nthat, although the horizon moves with constant speed,\nthe intensity of the correlations decays fast with larger\ndistances and the correlation length remains finite.\nThe observed mixed correlations can be interpreted as\nan implication of energy conservation. At time t = 0 the\nwhole correlation energy is stored in the short-ranged\ntriplets; at t > 0 the action of the evolution operator\nleads to the formation of longer-distance singlets between\nspatially separated sites. This singlet component persists\nfor longer times and leads to the appearance of the antiferromagnetic component in the spin-spin correlation\nfunction. Therefore the local redistribution of correlation energy, revealed in the partial AF correlation, is one\npossible explanation for the emergence of mixed correlations.\n\nC.\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)\n\ni\n\nRehSi+ (t)Sj\u2212 (t)i,\n\nInitially prepared singlet state\n\n(19)\n\n|i\u2212j|=l\n\nwhich indicates that the translational symmetry is recovered for long-range correlations.

The straight line marks the horizon of\nquasiparticles moving with spin-wave velocity vs . The plot\nresolves magnitudes larger than 10\u22127 .\n\nFor bosonic systems this state can be experimentally realized by time evolution of the initial triplet product state\nin the presence of a magnetic field gradient [11]. This initial state also corresponds to the decoupled double-well\nground state of the respective fermionic system, though\nin this case the evolving Hamiltonian is the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model instead of the ferromagnetic one.\nHowever, since the dynamical evolution is independent of\nthe overall sign of the Hamiltonian, the results discussed\nin this section will also hold for the fermionic system.\nUnlike the case of initially prepared triplet state, here\nthe spherical symmetry is not broken, and the populations of the x, y and z components of the triplets are\nequal. From Fig. 9 we extract that\nx,y,z\nhtx,y,z\neven iqs = htodd iqs = 0.125 ,\nhseven iqs = hsodd iqs = 0.625 .\n\n(21)\n\nThese values are a direct consequence of the energy con1\nhH(t)i = 0.375. In Fig. 10 we study the\nservation, 2N\nspatial correlations. Fig. 10a) shows a rapidly developed\nbroad antiferromagnetic peak in the noise correlations\nand weak incommensurate peaks at small wave vectors.\nThese are due to large-distance spinon correlations, depicted in Fig. 10b). The fact that the correlations remain\nnegative after the spinon horizon passes (Fig. 10c) can be\ninterpreted as a memory effect of the initial singlet state.\nFig. 10c) shows, by investigating the quantity Q+\u2212 (l, t)\n(see Eq. (19)), that the translational symmetry is recovered in the long-range correlation functions, as is the case\nalso for the short-range singlet and triplet correlations.\nIn general, the prepared singlet product state, due to\nits initial spherical symmetry, does not exhibit the strong\nmixing of anti- and ferromagnetic correlations, as the\ntriplet state does. Although the observed spinon correlations are interesting from the theoretical point of view,\ntheir weak effect on the noise correlations is barely measurable experimentally. We also note that the spinon\ncorrelations may disappear on large time scales which\nare inaccessible numerically.\n\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper we proposed a novel protocol which creates, from a system of two-component atoms initially prepared in an array of triplet (singlet) pairs on neighboring sites, an array of long-distance triplet (singlet) pairs\nacross the lattice. The method allows parallel generation\nof many entangled pairs, and can have relevant applications for the implementation of quantum purification\nprotocols in optical lattices. We also find that by applying the iterative swapping procedure in an open chain\none can engineer a state in which any atom located in the\nright half of the superlattice is entangled with an atom in\n\n\f12\n0.02\n\n0.004\n\n0\n\n0.000\n\n+-\n\n-0.004\n\nG (l,t), l=9\n+Q (l,t), l=9\n+G (l,t), l=10\n+Q (l,t), l=10\n+G (l,t), l=11\n+Q (l,t), l=11\n\n+-\n\n+-\n\nG (l,t)\n\n0.01\n\nc)\n\n+-\n\nvst=0\nvst=1\nvst=5\nvst=10\nvst=14\n\nG (l,t), Q (l,t)\n\nb)\n\n-0.01\n\n-0.02\n0\n\n-0.008\n\n5\n\n10 15 20 25 30\nl\n\n-0.012\n0\n\n5 vt\ns\n\n10\n\nFIG. 10: Correlations for an infinite chain using TEBD simulations, vs = J\u03c0/2~. a) The noise correlations for the system\nprepared in the singlet product state.

This state has maximally separated entangled atoms and persistency of entanglement as large as\nthat of a cluster state, which makes it suitable for being\nused as a component of a one-way quantum computer\n[31].\nWe also studied the evolution of an initial triplet (singlet) product state under a Heisenberg Hamiltonian. Analyzing various observables we showed that while the\nlong-range properties of the evolving state are in agreement with those predicted by conformal field theory, the\nnon-universal short-range properties (e.g. the development of a magnetic state with mixed correlations), are\nnot captured by such theoretical treatments [41] and have\nto be analyzed more carefully. They might be a manifestation of a special type of thermalization (in the sense of\ngeneralized Gibbs ensemble [43]), observed in integrable\nsystems.\nThe analysis presented in this paper demonstrates that\nthe coherent evolution of an initial state, which itself can\nbe easily prepared \u2013 in our case it is just an array of\n\ntriplet (singlet) states on neighboring sites \u2013, is a feasible way to generate complex magnetic states with cold\natoms. The dynamical generation method is not constrained by the difficulty of actual (physical) engineering\nof exotic Hamiltonians or by the low temperatures required to reach their ground states. On the other hand,\nwithout a careful analysis it is difficult to predict a priori\nthe properties of the non-equilibrium state into which the\nsystem evolves as a result of coherent quantum dynamics.\n\n[1] C.
