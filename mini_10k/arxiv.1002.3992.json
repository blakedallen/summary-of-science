In this way, the\ngovernment is made in a vertical position, from top to\nbottom\u2010 from the state to the citizen. Against this concept,\nthe interaction between the citizen and the state must be\nassimilated, and that is from bottom to top\u2010 the electronic\ndemocracy, by which the citizen can use an electronic\nsystem in order to communicate with other citizens or\neven with the institutions of the public authority. The\nelectronic democracy is organized for the citizens and by\nthe state, to make possible evaluating the improvement\nproposals for the government process and debating the\ngovernmental activities or actions. All these problems are\nmade on the internet, by the personal opinions sites,\ndedicated portal forums, chats and discussions list. The\nelectronic democracy came up as a necessity, by which\nthe state transfers information regarding the efficient\npublic services to the citizens, to perfect and modernize\nthe democratic system. In this way, the e\u2010government is a\ncomplex phenomenon that refers to multiple connections\nthat are between the authorities and the persons or\ncompanies that exist in a society.\n----------------\n\n\uf0b7 Bercea L. is with the Faculty of Law and Administrative Sciences,\nWest University of Timisoara, Romania\n\uf0b7 Nemtoi G. is with the Law and Judicial Sciences Department,\nFaculty of Economics and Public Administration, Stefan cel Mare\nUniversity of Suceava, 13 University Str., Suceava, Romania\n\uf0b7 Ungureanu C. is with the Faculty of Economics and Public\nAdministration, Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava, 13 University\nStr., Suceava, Romania\n\n2 MATERIALS AND METHODS \u2013 THE NEED FOR\nELECTRONIC DEMOCRACY\n\nAll over the world, the governments look with a great\ninterest to the new technologies and future electronic\nservices, but their vision stops when taking into\ncalculation the technical aspects. Although the new\ntechnologies are the ones that allow the implementation\nof electronic government, it must be said that an\nelectronic implementation of public services means major\nchanges, on an internal but also external level of the\ninstitution, or in short it means a new approach to serving\nthe citizen. The e\u2010government has gone through 3 phases:\nforms presentation, the possibility to download the\nnecessary forms to interact with the authorities and the\npossibility to complete the forms on\u2010line and make\ntransactions, implicitly paying the debts to the public\nauthorities.\nThe development degree of the electronic government\nand democracy depends directly on the access of the\npopulation to the internet. In order to ease the citizen's\naccess to the electronic services, the web sites of the\npublic institutions must present upgraded information in\na clear and concise. The information must be easily\naccessible with any browser and be presented both in an\ninternational and a national language. The e\u2010government\nrepresents the process to recreate the public sector by\ndigitalization and new management techniques of the\ninformation. By this process are followed the increase of\nthe citizen's political involvement and the efficiency of\nthe administrative apparatus. Seen from this point of\nview, the e\u2010governance reunites three situations as base\nmodels of the system and those are:\n\uf0b7 The technical paradigm, that consists of the use of\nthe electronic technologies in communication (e\u2010\nmail, chat, internet sites).\n\uf0b7 The managerial paradigm, that aims to apply new\nmanagement modes for the information;\n\uf0b7 The functional paradigm, that refers to the\nquantum of the active involvement of the\npopulation by accessing the internet for the\nadministrative apparatus's services.\n\n\fJOURNAL OF COMPUTING, VOLUME 2, ISSUE 2, FEBRUARY 2010, ISSN 2151-9617\nHTTPS://SITES.GOOGLE.COM/SITE/JOURNALOFCOMPUTING/\n\nWithin the government process, three categories of\nparticipants are involved:\n\uf0b7 The public participants, which represent the public\ninstitutions of the central and local administration.\n\uf0b7 The given country's participants \u2010 the citizens.\n\uf0b7 The participants of the private foreign companies\nthat organize commercial activities.\nThese participants create specific communicational and\ntransactional relations, that trigger existent intern flows\nwithin a participants class (the relations between the\nParliament and Government), or external flows between\ntwo classes of participants (citizen and public institution).\nThe main components of the e\u2010government will be\ndescribed below.\n\n3 THE OBJECTIVES OF THE E-GOVERNMENT\nCOMPONENTS\n\nStarting from the premises that, by the objectives of the\ninformational society, the efficiency of the administrative\nact is desired, in 2003, in Romania, the National Electronic\nSystem (SEN) launches at the www.e\u2010guvernare.ro\naddress an informational system of public utility which\nhas, as a main objective, assuring the access to the public\ninformation and supplying public services. The SEN\nrepresents the main access point to information and\nelectronic services of the public administration, which\noffers to the users a wide range of electronic services\ndestined to the private companies, access to forms, access\nto administrative procedures of the public administration\netc. In present times, the SEN has the following services\nimplemented:\n\uf0b7 The main SEN portal and access for the interested\nto information regarding contact points of the\npublic institutions (http://www.e\u2010guvernare.ro).\n\uf0b7 Information regarding the processing procedures.\n\uf0b7 Access to electronic services of the central and local\npublic administration\n(https://formularunic.e\u2010\nguvernare.ro).\nThe key objectives of the e\u2010government portal are:\n\uf0b7 The public electronic services must be oriented\ntowards the user.\n\uf0b7 The electronic services must be secured and\ntrustworthy.\n\uf0b7 The services must be supplied unitarily and\nthrough a simple, intuitive and standardized\ninterface.\n\uf0b7 Transparence in the public administration.\nIn the development process of the electronic government,\nthe SEN role is to assure infrastructure services for the\nusers:\n\uf0b7 Secured routing engine of the messages for the\nelectronic government services.\n\uf0b7 Unique access point to the public services supplied\nby electronic means.\n\uf0b7 Single Sing\u2010On for the electronic government\nservices.\n\uf0b7 Transaction engine for the electronic government\nservices.\n\n26\n\n\uf0b7\n\nMessaging engine for the electronic government\nservices.\n\uf0b7 Reporting engine for the electronic government\nservices.\n\uf0b7 A collection of services' documents, functioning\nlibraries that are at the disposal of any\nindependent developer wishing to create\napplications with the SEN.\nA fact must be taken into account\u2010 that the whole\ncommunication in the transactional environment between\nthe users must be done by ISO, PDF, xml documents. The\nwww.e\u2010guvernare.ro portal groups the four components\nof the IT system:\n\uf0b7 G2G\u2010Government to Government\nThe G2G is an IT system by which can be followed the\ncommunication by electronic means between the public\ninstitutions and consist in collecting data contained by the\npublic institutions and applying solutions for their\nsolving, the G2G means communication between several\npublic institutions to solve an unique problem of the\ncitizen.\nIntegrating the intergovernmental systems is the first\nstep in implementing electronic government solutions.\n\uf0b7 G2E\u2010Government to Employee\nThe G2E involves the existence of the online\nmanagement of the relation between the government and\nemployees by the TIC. This system involves 2 types of\napplications: applications that ease the fulfilling of work\ntasks and applications for the management of the\nemployee situation of the government employee.\n\uf0b7 G2C\u2010Government to Citizens\nThe G2C is a component of the e\u2010government portal\nwhich implements the relations between the government\nand the citizen. In essence, the G2C represents the most\nimportant component because the relation between the\ncitizen and government is interactive and is made by\nthree application types: applications that make the major\nfunction of the state to facilitate transparency and free\nchange of information between the citizen and the state,\napplication that consist in fulfilling the state's role as an\nelectronic\ngovernmental\nservices\nsupplier\nand\napplications that make the electronic vote. The G2C\ncomponent is decisive in the effective participation of the\ncitizen to the state's governmental political life.\n\uf0b7 G2B\u2010Government to Business\nThe relations between the companies and the state are\nan important cause in developing this component because\nthe private companies represent the economical growth\nengine of the state, therefore the relation supplied by the\nadministrative authorities to the companies have, as a\npurpose, creating an informational area that is to simplify\nthe interaction between the state and companies\nThere are two types of applications: the internet public\nacquisitions systems and the services offered by the state to the\nprivate sector. Out of these applications, the most useful\nare the one that require less time and money for the\ngovernment and for the companies.\n\n\fJOURNAL OF COMPUTING, VOLUME 2, ISSUE 2, FEBRUARY 2010, ISSN 2151-9617\nHTTPS://SITES.GOOGLE.COM/SITE/JOURNALOFCOMPUTING/\n\n27\n\n4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe e\u2010government is a modern concept, which might\nbe extremely useful for each of us. The part of e\u2010\ngovernment solutions is described by the site having the\nsame name and assumes \"the reducing of bureaucracy\nadministrative borders, as well as facilitating the access to\npublic information and services\". In this way, by means\nof the electronic government, the public services become\nmore efficient, more transparent and more accessible, no\nmatter the time or place. The unique point of access to\nthese services and public information, established\naccording to Law 161/2003 is The National Electronic\nsystem (NES) (source: www.e\u2010guvernare.ro).\nThe main objectives of EU within e\u2010administration, which\nhave to be reached in Romania also, as result of the\nagreements signed, refer in generally to:\n\uf0b7 making efficient the public administration\nactivities;\n\uf0b7 Facilitating the access of citizens to various range\nof electronic services;\n\uf0b7 A higher transparency of the decisional act over\nthe administrative instrument; all these would\ngenerate\nthe\nmentioned\nreduction\nover\nbureaucracy costs.\nAccording to European agenda established two years ago,\nthis objective has to be reached until 2010, by all member\nstates of EU. This fact, regarded at the current level of\ninformatics over public administration of Romania, does\nnot seem a demarche too easily to accomplish. Even if the\nfunds allotted in order to gather the know\u2010how over\nimplementing the e\u2010government technologies were\nenough, according to specialists, one might see a\ndeficiency at the level of understanding these notions, at\nthe administrative level, which translates into a\npreponderant orientation towards citizens, in the\ndetriment of business environment, according to the\nstudies carried out. The result of implementing the\ninformation system is a main reason on depletion of the\nbureaucracy frame.\n\n4 CONCLUSIONS\nThe electronic government is one of the important\nmanifestations of the contemporary society, because it\ninvolves institutions of the state, public and private\norganizations and especially the citizen's activity, him\nparticipating electronically to the government activity.\nAlthough considered as a problematic positively accepted\nby the civil society, the electronic government, besides its\nbenefits involves a series of risks such as: the reaction of\nthe employees within the implementing organization, the\nneutralization risk by the beneficiaries because of the lack\nof internet access or fears connected to the security of the\nspread information, the technological process that could\ndetermine the need to continuously upgrade the system\netc. In conclusion, implementing this portal means a new\ndevelopment stage to the state institutions and, finally, an\nevolution in de\u2010concentrating the administrative\nbureaucracy.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n\n[5]\n[6]\n\nI Vasiliu, I Vasiliu, Internet \u2013 Ghid de navigare , Ed., Albastr\u0103,\n1996, I.Vasiliu, Criminalitatea Informatic\u0103, Ed., Nemira , 1998.\nMicu, B.G. 2002.
