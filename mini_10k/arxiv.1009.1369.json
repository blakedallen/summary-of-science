INTRODUCTIOIN\nAt present time our understanding of gravity\nis far from being complete: on large scale\ngravitational dynamics is described by\nimmensely successful theory of general relativity\n(or its Newtonian limit) while in micro-level\nparticle motion is governed by quantum\nmechanics; but no bridge yet exists between the\ntwo extremes. In the same time cosmology and\nastrophysics are growing increasingly dependent\non research in particle physics and quantum\ndynamics, especially in conjunction with \"dark\nmatter\" and \"dark energy\" theories that are called\nto explain unexpected observational data. Thus\nwe cannot be sure that our interpretation of\nmotion of celestial bodies by means of classical\ngravitational theory, which cannot yet be\nextrapolated down to microscopic level where\nquantum effects are expected to dominate, is\nfully accurate.\nNot surprisingly, there is a great deal of\nintellectual effort devoted to research in quantum\ngravity (see for e.g. Burgess 2003). The view\nshared by most quantum gravity scientists that at\nmicro-level space-time continuum breaks down\ninto a discreet and even disjointed \"foam\" is very\nhard to reconcile with the principles of general\nrelativity simply because the latter requires a\nspace-time continuum! Therefore I adopt a\ndifferent view, which preserves space-time\ncontinuum at micro-level yet relies on principles\nof quantum dynamics to describe particle motion\non microscopic level.\n\ncomplex system of bodies is involved (which is\ntrue of any real-world situation). Then what is\nthe intrinsic shape of the potential well produced\nby a fundamentally simple body in a space\ndevoid of other bodies and their corresponding\nfields? To arrive at a realistic picture I postulate\nthat the intrinsic shape of the potential well\nproduced by a fundamentally simple body is a\nspherically symmetric r-1 potential combined\nwith the energy of intrinsic fluctuations\nexpressed by a spherically symmetric wave of\nthe amplitude diminishing as r-1 and wavelength\nincreasing as r:\n(1)\nBecause the second constituent of the\npotential \u03c6(r) is very small the resulting field of a\nmacroscopic body is well approximated by\nsmooth r-1 potential employed in classical\ndynamics. However, effects of the wave\nconstituent will be important when motion of\nmicroscopic bodies is concerned.\nHaving postulated in equation (1) the\nintrinsic potential of a fundamentally simple\nbody, which radial profile is depicted on fig. 1,\nwe can calculate the field of a complex body as a\nsuperposition of a large number of intrinsic\npotentials \u2013 fig. 2.\n\n2. PRINCIPLES OF QUANTUM GRAVITY\nClassical gravity prescribes that a massive\nbody produces smooth and featureless r-1\npotential well, the notion, which is a very na\u00efve\nin the realm of quantum physics. More realistic\nquantum mechanical view calls for a\nmacroscopically smooth potential field to\nproduce energy fluctuations at microscopic level.\nFrom the stochastic point of view, however,\nfluctuations are expected to arise when a\n\nFig. 1. Radial profile of the intrinsic quantum\ngravitational potential.\n\nBy examining the result of the superposition\nof the large number of intrinsic potentials one\n\n\fcan easily notice circular groove structure that\nbecomes more and more regular (i.e. round) with\ndistance from the center of mass. In the same\ntime individual stochastic fluctuations or\ngravitons, depicted on the overlay image on fig.\n2 are clearly seen on microscopic level. The\nresulting stochastic fluctuations correspond to\nelongated ellipsoids arranged in groves and\noriented tangentially to groves. On the grand\nscale the fluctuations pervade the entire Universe\nand form a mesh-like structure of peaks and pits\ncorresponding to superposition (or intersection)\nof groves produced by neighboring bodies.\n\nFig. 2. Potential of a complex body modeled as a\nsuperposition of intrinsic potentials. Small detail is\nartificially enhanced while the global r-1 bias is removed.\nNote circular groove structure that becomes more and more\nround with distance from the center of mass. Overlay\ncorresponds to a magnified area of the potential depicting\nindividual small-scale stochastic fluctuations \u2013 gravitons \u2013\narising in the field.\n\nWhen a motion of microscopic particles is\nconcerned such particles no longer travel in\nempty space but instead move through the\nuniversal field of gravitational energy\nfluctuations and interact with gravitons, which\nare organized in groves closer to massive bodies\nand form quasi-static stochastic mesh far from\ngravitating masses. Gravitational energy\nfluctuations will form stochastic potential\nbarriers on particle trajectory thus causing\nreflection from or tunneling through the potential\nbarrier. Because gravitational energy fluctuations\nare localized (even when aligned in groves) and\ndo not form a continuous barrier the particles\n\nwill also scatter from gravitons in addition to\nreflection and tunneling. Therefore within the\nframework of quantum gravity motion of a\nparticle corresponds to a process of scattering\nfrom / tunneling through the field of gravitons\nglobally biased by the classical Newtonian (or\nrelativistic) gravitational potential.\nNaturally, for a free particle the vector of the\nmomentary displacement will coincide with the\ndirection of the greatest tunneling probability.\nTherefore to account for direction the velocity\nvector must correspond to a \"skew\" in the\nparticle's intrinsic kinetic energy profile \u2013 fig. 3.\n\nFig. 3. Particle with energy E confined between\ngravitational field fluctuations with energy U.\n\nThe greater particle's intrinsic energy is \u2013 the\ngreater is the probability of tunneling especially\nin the preferred direction determined by the skew\nin the particle's intrinsic energy field, thus the\ngreater is the particle's velocity. Interesting, but\nthe concept of tunneling within the framework of\nquantum gravity implies maximum velocity\ncorresponding to tunneling probability D = 1.\nSupposing that maximum velocity corresponds to\nthe speed of light c the particle tunneling velocity\nV can be defined as\nV = cD\n\n(2)\n\nIn the case of a complex body corresponding\nto a bound system of particles the macroscopic\nvelocity of the body will be expressed by a\ndifferent formula than the equation (2). First of\nall, the stability of a macroscopic body requires\nbinding energy EB to be greater than the energies\nof compounding particles (EB >> E) or the\n\n\fsystem will break apart in no time \u2013 fig. 4. For\nexample the total energy of nucleons is in the\norder of 1 GeV and is much greater than the\nenergy of \"free\" quarks, which is thought to be\non the order of 5-10 MeV for u- and d-quarks.\nThus, the constituents of a complex body are\nsubjected to interaction with gravitational field\nfluctuations (i.e. gravitons) within the limits set\nby the total binding energy of the body.\n\nthe center of mass on approaching trajectories \u2013\nfig. 5.\n\nFig. 5. Direction of graviton scattering force on\ncircular orbit, approaching and reproaching trajectories.\n\nThus in the case of circular or near-circular\norbital motion an additional central acceleration\naQ will be acting on the orbiting body:\nFig. 4. Energy diagram of a complex body. Individual\nparticles with energy E are confined within a potential well\nwith energy EB binding the particles together.\n\n3. GRAVITON SCATTERING FORCE\nThe most interesting question to ask is what\neffects on orbital motion of celestial bodies the\nproposed theory of quantum gravity can possibly\nhave? To answer this question let us consider a\ncircular orbital motion of a complex body in a\nNewtonian limit, which is classically expressed\nin terms of the Newtonian gravitational\nacceleration gN\n(3)\nWhen considering a scenario involving the\nfield of gravitational energy fluctuations in the\nform as depicted on fig. 2 it is clear that an\norbiting body will experience an additional force\ndue to scattering of particles from gravitons. The\ncircular grove arrangement of gravitons as well\nas their elongated shape favors scattering\ntowards the center of mass on circular orbits and\nreproaching trajectories and scattering away from\n\na = gN + aQ\n\n(4)\n\nAdditional acceleration a0 can be calculated\nfrom the change of impulse dp/dt as follows:\n(5)\nwhere \u03c3 is a scattering probability, D \u2013\ntunneling probability through gravitons, and 1/l \u2013\nis linear density of gravitons (which is equivalent\nto the characteristic graviton size except for a\nconstant scaling factor), and m is the total mass\nof the body.\nTo understand the validity of equation (5)\none must consider the process of motion on\nmicroscopic level: a complex macroscopic body\ncorresponding to a bound system of microscopic\nparticles is moving through the field of gravitons\narranged in groves; the microscopic particles\nscatter from gravitons in the preferred direction\neither towards the center of mass or away from it\ndepending on the trajectory of the body; some\nparticles, however, tunnel through the\nfluctuations. Thus a change in the impulse vector\nof the macroscopic body occurs. Assuming that\nthe energy E of microscopic particles comprising\nthe body is much less than the energy of\n\n\ffluctuations U (i.e. E << U) the scattering is\ngoing to be elastic with no change in the impulse\nmagnitude but only in direction. The v/l term in\nequation (5) accounts for the rate of scattering,\nwhich is directly proportional to the body\nvelocity and inversely proportional to the linear\ndensity of gravitons.\nNon-relativistic scattering probability \u03c3 of\nparticles is inversely proportional to the square of\nthe particle's impulse (Blokhintsev 1983):\n(6)\nAssuming that the internal energy density of\na graviton can be approximated by a rectangular\npotential barrier, tunneling probability D for the\ncase of U > E can be calculated as (Yariv 1982):\n\nsuch conditions the comprising particles are\nforced to tunnel through gravitons only when\nthey reach an edge of the potential barrier\ndefining the macroscopic system. At that\nmoment the microscopic particle assumes\nvelocity of the macroscopic system due to the\nelastic collision with a larger potential barrier.\nAfter being endowed with velocity of the\nmacroscopic system the comprising particles\nscatter on gravitons. Therefore, for nonrelativistic velocities\n\nand we can\n\nrewrite the equations (8) and (9) as\n(11)\n(12)\nThe approximation implies that \u03b3 -2v2 << 1,\nwhich is necessary to ensure that the gravitation\nscattering is small.\n\n(7)\nwhich in the case of\n\nThus the final equation for the acceleration\nproduced by the gravitational energy fluctuations\non circular orbit is\n\ncan be approximated as\n\n(13)\n(8)\nand\n(9)\nwhere \u03b3 has a dimension of velocity:\n(10)\nNow, remembering that U >> E it is safe to\nassume that the intrinsic motion of microscopic\nparticles within the macroscopic body is\nnegligible and the comprising particles are\nmoved \"helplessly\" by collisions with gravitons\nwithin the volume of space defined by the\nbinding energy of the macroscopic system. In\n\nNote that the circular groove alignment of\ngravitons and the change in direction of the\ngraviton scattering force depending on the\napproaching or reproaching trajectories implies\nthat all non-circular orbits will tend to relax to\ncircular ones due to the corrective effect of the\ngraviton scattering force. This quantum\ngravitational preference for orbits with low\neccentricity can be responsible for deep\nisothermality of stellar systems that are pressure\nsupported (i. e. elliptic and spheroid galaxies,\nintercluster gas).\nOn the scope of galactic orbits a hint of this\nbehavior is observed in Virgo cluster. Rubin,\nWaterman & Kenney (1999) report that elliptic\n\n\fgalaxies in Virgo (i.e. old cluster population)\nexhibit a tight Gaussian distribution of observed\nvelocities near 1100 km s-1, while spirals with\nnormal rotation curves (i.e. younger population)\nhave velocities evenly distributed in the range\nfrom \u2013400 km s-1 to 2600 km s-1. Curiously,\nspirals with disturbed rotation curves display\nvelocity distribution almost exactly matching the\nGaussian distribution for ellipticals. Because of\nthe match in velocity distribution I conclude that\nthe graviton scattering force is acting on young\nspiral galaxies moving on radial orbits\neffectively reducing orbital eccentricity and thus\ncausing disruption of rotation. It is doubtful that\ntidal interaction is responsible for this effect as it\nis unlikely to produce correlation in velocity\ndispersion with older elliptical galaxies, which in\nthe framework of quantum gravity should\nalready be on relaxed circular orbits.\n\n4. PROPERTIES OF FUNCTIONS OF U\nAND l\nEquation (13) states that the graviton\nscattering force depends the unknown functions\nU and l, which describe the energy and\ncharacteristic size of gravitons. With the\nquantum gravitational potential of a point source\ndefined by equation (1) the energy U and the\ncharacteristic size l of the gravitational energy\nfluctuations produced by a system of point\nsources will depend on the number (and possibly\ndensity) of the sources or the total mass of the\nsystem.\nTo determine the functions U and l a\nnumerical simulation was conducted involving\n105-106 quantum gravitational sources arranged\nin a sphere with density distributions ranging\nfrom \u03c1(r) = const to \u03c1(r) \u221d r-1 and \u03c1(r) \u221d r-2.\nThe resulting functions U and l were sampled at\nvarious points in space to uncover patterns. The\nsimulation revealed that for spherically\nsymmetric distribution the functions of U and l\nare independent of density and obey the\nfollowing laws:\n\nl(r) = l0r\n\n(14)\n(15)\n(16)\n\nThe functions (14) and (15) (which imply\nthat U(r) l(r) \u2248 U0 l0 regardless of r) are a direct\nconsequence of the postulate (1) for the potential\nof a quantum gravitational point source.\nAdditionally the equation (15) prescribes that in\nthe core of the system the function U varies more\nslowly with r-1 thus avoiding the infinity at r = 0\notherwise implied by the r-1 law. Also, r0 is a\ndiminishing function of density:\nr0 = f(\u03c1)\n\n(17)\n\nWhat is especially interesting about the\nfunction of U0 is that the mass in equation (16) is\nthe total mass of the system and not the mass\nenclosed within the radius r. This extremely\nimportant property of the U0 sets graviton\nscattering force apart from Newtonian gravity,\nwhich for spherically symmetrical distribution\ndepends only on the mass enclosed within the\nradius under consideration.\nArmed with the knowledge of the behavior of\nfunctions U and l the equation for the\nacceleration induced by the graviton scattering\nforce on circular orbit can be rewritten as:\n(18)\nThe equation (18) states that the contribution\nto the orbital acceleration by the graviton\nscattering force obeys the r-1 law in contrast to\nthe Newtonian gravity component, which follows\nthe conventional r-2 law.\nBased on the equation (18) the total circular\nacceleration can be expressed as:\n\n\f(19)\nwhere \u03bb has a dimension of acceleration:\n(20)\n\nthe bulk of the system mass (M(r>rc) \u2248 Mtotal)\nand the light traces mass (i.e. L \u221d\u039c) the equation\nfor the theoretical M/L ratio becomes\n(26)\nThe equation (26) is also true for dispersed\nsystems at large radii.\n\nand\n(21)\nIn the case of a point mass (or highly\nlocalized mass distribution) or for large radii\n(r \u2192 \u221e) \u03bb in equation (19) is constant: \u03bb = \u03bb0.\n5. THEORETICAL M/L RATIO\nFrom the equation for circular orbital\nacceleration (19) it is possible to derive a\ntheoretical M/L ratio for a quantum gravitational\nsystem. Supposing that the M/L ratio is\nequivalent to the ratio of the dynamical mass \u2013\nMdyn = ar2/G \u2013 calculated from the from the virial\ntheorem presuming that the system is in a state of\nequilibrium to the observed luminous mass, then\n(22)\nAnd from the equation (19) it follows that:\n\u03a50\n\n(23)\n\nwhere Y0 is a 'standard' M/L ratio (\u03a50 \u2248 5 in\nB-band or \u03a50 \u2248 1 in V-band).\nAlso, in the limit \u03bb >> a\n(24)\nand\n(25)\nAssuming that the distribution of matter in\nthe system under consideration is arranged\naround of a compact core of radius rc containing\n\nIn the central part of a dispersed system\nwhere M(r<rc) << Mtotal, however, a different\nrelation describes the theoretical mass-to-light\nratio:\n(27)\nWithin the very core of a dispersed system\nwhere the energy of gravitons U does not decay\nwith radius the theoretical M/L ratio is\n(28)\nThe three scenarios for mass-to-light ratios\ndescribed by equations (26)-(28) follow from the\nfirst principles of quantum gravity. In the\nfollowing sections I am going to apply the\nderived M/L ratios to various stellar systems to\nverify the predictions of quantum gravity.\n7. FLAT ROTATIONAL CURVES OF\nSPIRAL GALAXIES AND TULLY-FISHER\nRELATION\nFor stellar systems with substantial central\nmass concentrations (e. g. spiral galaxies\nincluding S0-type) and for elliptic galaxies that\nare not exceedingly sparse and faint (i.e. all\nellipticals but dSph galaxies) quantum gravity\npredicts Tully-Fisher law describing the\ncorrelation between maximum circular velocity\nvmax and total luminosity for rotation-supported\nsystems (i.e. spiral galaxies) and Faber-Jackson\nrelationship between central velocity dispersions\n\u03c3v and total luminosity for pressure-supported\nsystems such as elliptical galaxies.\n\n\fTully-Fisher relation can be derived as\nfollows. One can see from the equation (19) that\nthe graviton scattering force will dominate\nNewtonian gravity in the case of non-zero \u03bb and\nlow orbital accelerations. Thus for a << \u03bb the\ncircular orbital acceleration is\n(29)\nThe equation (29) implies an asymptotically\nflat rotational curve with maximum rotational\nvelocity\n(30)\nThe equation (30) is essentially a TullyFisher law vmax \u221d M0.25 for rotational curves of\nspiral galaxies, which follows from the first\nprinciples of quantum gravity.\nAlso, from the equation (19) follows that in\nthe core of the system the rotational curve is\ndominated by Newtonian gravity because there a\n>> \u03bb.\n\nranging from globular clusters to galaxy clusters\n(e.g. Sanders & McGaugh 2002). Surprisingly,\nMOND works even for those stellar systems, for\nwhich the theory was not originally designed (see\ne.g. MICM vs. Tx relationship for X-ray clusters\ndiscussed in Aguirre, Schaye & Quataert 2001).\nDespite all this success MOND is rejected by a\nmajority of physicists as an alternative to dark\nmatter. The reasons for reluctance of the\nscientific community to embrace MOND are the\nlack of basis for MOND built with conventional\nphysics; profound theoretical difficulties such as\nviolation of the Equivalence Principle and the 2nd\nNewton's Law (Bekenstein & Milgrom 1984);\nthe lack of relativistic extension (see Milgrom\n2001 and references there in); and the ambiguity\nof acceleration frames, which makes almost\nimpossible to derive concrete predictions with\nMOND on cosmological scale (Scott et al. 2001).\nYet because the quality of current observational\ndata cannot definitely rule-out MOND, the\ndebate over this theory continues.\nThe reason I decided to mention MOND in\nthis paper is that there are certain similarities\nbetween MOND and the presented theory of\nquantum gravity. For instance in the limit of low\naccelerations (gN << a0) MOND states that\n(31)\n\n8. COMPARISON OF QUANTUM\nGRAVITY TO MOND\nThere is another theory \u2013 Modified\nNewtonian Dynamics (MOND) \u2013 that predicts\nflat rotational curves of spiral galaxies and TullyFisher / Faber-Jackson laws for maximum\nrotational velocity and line-of-site velocity\ndispersions vs. total optical luminosity relations.\nModified Newtonian Dynamics was pioneered\nby Milgrom over two decades ago in attempt to\neliminate the dark matter problem (Milgrom\n1983a,b,c; see also Milgrom 1998). While\nMOND is a phenomenologically-driven theory,\nwhich incorporates the observed Tully-Fisher\nrelation as one of it postulates, MOND enjoys\ntremendous success in explaining the observed\neffects of 'dark matter' in diverse stellar systems\n\nwhich is strikingly similar (to within an\nfactor of +1) to the prediction of quantum\ngravity:\n(32)\nIn the spirit of this parallel\n(33)\nThe main differences between the two\ntheories are as follows:\n1) The quantum gravity predicts an extra\nforce addition to Newtonian gravity,\nwhile MOND postulates a modification of\nNewtonian gravity;\n\n\f2) The quantum gravity is based on\nconventional physics such as quantum\nmechanics while MOND is not;\n3) Flat rotational curves and the TullyFisher law follow from the basic\nprinciples of quantum gravity while\nMOND postulates these relations;\n4) The graviton scattering force in quantum\ngravity depends on the total mass of the\nsystem, while the modification of gravity\nin MOND depends on the mass enclosed\nwithin the radius of consideration;\n5) Although \u03bb \u2248 a0, \u03bb is not constant in\nquantum gravity, while a0 is constant in\nMOND.\nThe last two points make big difference when\npredictions of both theories are applied to\nclusters of galaxies. Most notably MOND breaks\ndown in X-ray cluster cores where it fails to\nreproduce the observed X-ray emitting gas\ntemperature profiles (Aguirre et al. 2001) and\ncannot account for the observed M/L ratio\nwithout requiring large amounts of unseen matter\n(Gerbal et al. 1992). Obviously aware of the\nproblem for MOND in X-ray cluster cores,\nMilgrom (1998) stipulates that there must\nbaryonic matter in X-ray cluster cores (e.g.\n'warm' hydrogen gas), which is not yet detected.\nAlthough present-date cooling flow deposition\nrates are insufficient to account for the missing\nmatter in the cluster cores, Milgrom suggests that\nthe rates could have been higher in the past.\nIronically, a EUV-excess in Virgo (Lieu et al.\n1996a), Coma (Lieu et al. 1996b) cluster was\nrecently reported adding oil to the fire of the Xray cluster core controversy. Unfortunately, no\nfirm conclusion can be drawn yet about the\nreported UV excess as the opinions are split\namong researchers with regard to the origin of\nthe UV emission: while Bonamente & Lieu\n(2000) firmly believe that the UV excess if\nproduced by large amounts of warm gas much\nneeded for the rescue of MOND, the other group\n(Bowyer, Korpela & Bergh\u00f6fer 2001) advocates\na strongly opposing point and even challenge the\n\nexcess EUV findings of the former group (e.g.\nBergh\u00f6fer & Bowyer 2002).\nRegardless of the EUV excess findings\nquantum gravity does not require large amounts\nof unseen matter in X-ray cluster cores. Although\nshould the discussed deposits of 'warm'\nhydrogen gas really exist in X-ray cluster cores\ntheir presence or absence is not critical for the\npredictions of quantum gravity as the unlike\nMOND the quantum gravity theory is concerned\nwith the total mass rather than the mass in the\ncore.\nLastly I would like to remind that\nAbramovici & Vager 1986 have shown that the\nSecond Newton Law F=ma holds down to\naccelerations as low as 10-9 cm s-2, which is\nclearly below the critical MOND acceleration a0\n~ 10-8 cm s-2 and therefore at odds with MOND.\nBecause of the similarity of the two theories,\nhowever, which amounts to the effective action\nat low accelerations, quantum gravity benefits\nfrom the vast amount of evidence usually cited in\nfavor of MOND (see e.g. Milgrom 2003, Scarpa\n2003, Sanders & McGaugh 2002, Sanders 2001)\nwhile avoiding the noted shortcoming of MOND.\n9. DWARF SPHEROID GALAXIES: DARK\nMATTER CONTENT AND VELOCITY\nDISPERSIONS\nMeasurements of central velocity dispersions\nin dwarf spheroid galaxies \u2013 dSphs \u2013 reveal\ndynamical masses of dSph systems far greater\nthan their observed luminous masses and\nresulting in M/L ratios between 10 and 100\n(Mateo 1994). Although there is a considerable\nuncertainty in the estimates of M/L ratios for\ndSph galaxies (in part due to their extreme\nfaintness and large angular sizes), it is clear that\nthe stellar content alone cannot account for the\nobserved velocity dispersions.\nBesides large dark matter content dwarf\nspheroid galaxies are characterized by a central\nvelocity dispersions being in the range of 5-12\n\n\fkm s-1 while their luminosities span about two\norders of magnitude (Gallagher & Wyse 1994).\nThus unlike spiral or elliptical galaxies dSph\nsystems show no strong correlation between the\nvelocity dispersions and optical luminosities\nwhen taken individually. Although velocity\ndispersions of dSph galaxies are plotted versus\nluminosity along with other dwarf systems such\nas dIr and dE galaxies they fall on the same \u03c3v \u221d\nL0.25 trend very tightly (Dekel & Woo 2003).\nAlso, there exists great uncertainty in measuring\ntotal optical luminosities of dwarf spheroid\ngalaxies because of their large angular size and\nextreme faintness, which along with other effects\nsuch as tidal interaction and hydrogen cooling at\nT \u2265 104 may contribute to the leveling off of the\n\u03c3 v vs. L relation for dwarf systems in general\n(Dekel & Woo 2003).\nIn the realm of quantum gravity dwarf\nspheroid systems are expected to show signs of\nlarge amounts of dark matter. From equation (26)\nit follows that the less luminosity there is in a\ndwarf the higher its M/L ratio will be. This trend\nis in fact very well established (e.g. Mateo et al.\n1993). Also Mateo et al. (1993) finds that M/L\nratios for dwarf spheroid galaxies in B-band have\na constant bias of \u03a5 ~ 5, which could be\nindicative of the contribution of the Newtonian\ngravity predicted by the equation (23).\n\u0392\n\nWhat else quantum gravity is telling us about\ndwarf systems is that these objects will remain\nbound by the graviton scattering force for a wide\nrange of radii even when these systems are\nsubjected to tidal disruption. Perhaps the tidal\ndisruption is responsible for breaks in dSph\nstellar density distributions, which can be fitted\nby two-component King profiles (e.g. Pryor &\nKormendy 1990). Tidal interaction will tend to\nsend stars in outer regions of dwarf systems on\nhigher orbits bound by the graviton scattering\nforce rather than simply tear stars away. The net\neffect of such interaction is that the system stellar\ndensity is diluted the surface brightness is\ndecreased with time. Support for this argument\ncan be drawn from the observed correlation\n\nbetween dwarf metallicity and surface\nbrightness, which reveals that metal poor systems\nare much fainter than their metal-rich\ncounterparts (Caldwell et al. 1992). Presuming\nthat lower metallicity is indicative of greater age,\nthe observed relationship implies that the stellar\ndensities of older dSph systems are in fact\ndiluted and the system geometry is expanded and\nsmeared by tidal interaction proportionally to the\nage of the system.\n10. ELLIPTIC GALAXIES\n10.1. Dark Matter Content\nDark matter content of elliptical galaxies of\nall sizes has become a subject of intense debate\nfor the most part due to the surprising findings of\nRomanowsky et al. (2003) indicating an\nunexpected 'dearth' of dark matter in 'ordinary'\nelliptic galaxies with characteristic luminosities\nin the order of 2.2\u00d71010 LB,\uf080(in B-band solar\nunits for Hubble constant H0=70 km s-1 Mpc-1).\nWhile both giant and dwarf ellipticals display\nsigns of vast amounts of 'dark matter' in their\nouter M/L ratios \u2013 whether in the case of strong\ngravitational lensing (e.g. Keeton 2001) or X-ray\nemission profiles (e.g. Loewenstein & White\n1999) for giant systems or in abnormally high\nstellar velocity dispersions in nearby dwarfs (e.g.\nMateo 1997) \u2013 according to Romanowsky et al.\n(2003) intermediate-size elliptic galaxies contain\nvery little or no dark matter at all. This is a\ndisturbing finding for CDM theorists.\nThis apparent discrepancy is easily\nunderstood within the framework of quantum\ngravity. The equation for orbital acceleration (19)\npredicts the Keplerian decline in circular velocity\nprofiles with radius to level off at the maximum\ncircular velocity vmax dictated by the graviton\nscattering force. This leveling off of the circular\nvelocity profile is attributed to the presence of\ndark matter when the galaxy is analyzed within\nthe context of Newtonian gravity. In the realm of\nquantum gravity magnitude of the maximum\n\n\fcircular velocity depends on the total system\nmass as prescribed by the equation (30).\nThus for massive ellipticals with luminosities\n~ 1013 L\uf080 and maximum circular velocities vmax\n~200-300 km s-1 the contribution of the graviton\nscattering force to the orbital acceleration is\nsignificant and is due to the large stellar mass of\nthese galaxies \u2013 see equation (18). Therefore at\nlarge radii graviton scattering force exceeds\nNewtonian gravity many times, which results in\nhigh observed M/L ratios.\nGoing down three orders of magnitude in\nmass / luminosity we arrive at 'ordinary'\nellipticals with characteristic luminosities ~1010\nL\uf080. According to (21) the maximum circular\nvelocity vmax for ordinary elliptical galaxies will\nbe in the range 40-60 km s-1, which is\ncomparable to the Newtonian circular velocities\nappropriate for their masses, hence the low dark\nmatter content.\nGoing down another three orders of\nmagnitude in mass / luminosity we arrive at\ndwarf systems with luminosities ~107 L\uf080. The\nequation (30) puts maximum circular velocity at\n~10 km s-1. This time contribution of the graviton\nscattering force is many times the magnitude of\nthe force of Newtonian gravity, and the observed\n'dark matter content' is high.\nSimilar reasoning for M/L ratios in elliptical\ngalaxies of various luminosities can be given in\nMONDian spirit: equation (29) relates orbital\nacceleration to the M/L ratio as M/L \u221d \u03bb/a. For\nsystems with low orbital accelerations (e.g.\ndwarf systems and outer rims of giant galaxies)\nthe M/L ratios are high, while for galaxies with\nhigh orbital accelerations (e.g. 'ordinary'\nellipticals) the resulting M/L is not much greater\nthan unity.\n10.2. Fundamental plane\nAnother interesting consequence of quantum\ngravity is that the theoretical M/L ratio (31)\nprovides a natural explanation for the tilt of the\n\nFundamental Plane of elliptical galaxies for faint\ndwarf and bright giant ellipticals alike. These\ntwo types of systems follow two vastly different\ntrends that cannot be reconciled with the help of\nthe virial theorem alone (see e.g. Busarello et al.\n1997) without resorting to rather ad hoc\nsystematic change in M/L with luminosity or\ndeparture from homology.\nIt is generally accepted that faint systems\nsuch as dwarf spheroid and dwarf elliptical\ngalaxies trace the following trend (Dekel & Silk\n1986; Peterson & Caldwell 1993)\nM/L \u221d L-0.4\n\n(34)\n\nThe equation (34) is consistent with the\nprediction of quantum gravity, which follows\nfrom the equation (26) for the theoretical M/L\nratio:\nM/L \u221d L-0.5\n\n(35)\n\nOn the other hand bright elliptical galaxies\nfollow a totally different relation (Gerhard &\nKronawitter 2000):\nM/L \u221d L0.37\n\n(36)\n\nGerhard & Kronawitter (2000) also obtain\nthe following scaling relationship for system size\nvs. luminosity:\nr \u221d L0.81\n\n(37)\n\nCombining the reported relation (37) with the\ntheoretical M/L ratio (26) yields\nM/L \u221d L0.31\n\n(38)\n\nIn the same time combining the relation (36)\nthe theoretical M/L ratio (26) produces\nr \u221d L0.87\n\n(39)\n\nThus the observed scaling relations for giant\nellipticals fit nicely the expectations of quantum\ngravity.\nEven more support for the quantum\ngravitational explanation of the tilt of the\nfundamental plane of elliptic galaxies can be\ndrawn from the detailed study conducted by\nBernardi et al. (2003) of rather substantial\n\n\fsample of 9000 early type galaxies obtained from\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey. For their sample\nBernardi et al. (2003) reports:\nM/L \u221d L0.14\u00b10.02\n\n(40)\n\nM/L \u221d R0.33\u00b10.09\n\n(41)\n\n(44)\n\nThe latter implies that\nR \u221d L1.0\u00b10.6\n\n(42)\n\nOnce again the reported results are consistent\nwith the M/L ratio predicted by quantum in\nequation (26) within the stated uncertainties with\nthe favorable R vs. L law for the sample given by\nthe following relation:\nR \u221d L1.3\n\n(Aguirre et al. 2001). In the same time MOND\nsuccessfully explains global M/L ratios for\ngalaxy clusters and even predicts accurate masstemperature relation for X-ray clusters (Aguirre\net al. 2001):\n\n(43)\n\nThus the theoretical M/L ratio (26) predicted\nby quantum gravity successfully describes the tilt\nof the Fundamental Plane for dwarf, ordinary and\ngiant elliptical galaxies erasing the discrepancy\nthat exists when analyzing the phenomenon\nusing the accepted CDM model, which requires\nad hoc effects such as evolution or systematic\nvariation of M/L with luminosity to explain the\ndifference in tilt.\n11. X-RAY CLUSTERS\n11.1 X-Ray Temperature And M/L Profiles\nWhen considered in the framework of\nquantum gravity X-Ray galaxy clusters fall\nroughly in the same category as dSph systems.\nThis similarity is not accidental and is caused by\nthe fact that both types of systems correspond to\nrelatively sparse and geometrically extended\nstellar systems where accelerations are measured\ninside the mass distribution rather than outside\n(which is the case for outer edges of spiral and\nelliptical galaxies). The discussion of X-ray\nclusters is especially important because MOND\ncannot account for high M/L ratios detected in Xray cluster cores without requiring vast amounts\nof unseen matter (Gerbal et al. 1992) and further\nfails to reproduce flat X-ray emitting gas\ntemperature profiles observed in galaxy clusters\n\nIn other words predictions of MOND imply\nthat the bulk of the cluster mass is concentrated\nin the cluster core, e.g. in the form of warm gas\nas suggested by Milgrom. The latter expectation\nhas been a reason for a major debate regarding\nthe existence of large quantities of warm\nhydrogen gas in galaxy cluster cores, which was\nalready discusses in \u00a78 of this paper. Although a\nfirm conclusion has not yet been reached in the\ncluster EUV excess debate, the outcome of the\ndiscussion has little bearing on quantum gravity.\nAs I have pointed out in \u00a74 of this paper the\nexact mass distribution does not matter very\nmuch: it is the total mass that counts. Thus in the\ncontext of X-ray clusters quantum gravity\nbehaves similar to MOND except that the total\nmass of the cluster figures in the equation for the\nadditional acceleration produced by the graviton\nscattering force thus avoiding the difficulty that\nMOND experiences in cluster cores. In other\nwords in the realm of quantum gravity M/L ratio\nfor X-ray clusters will remain more or less flat\nwith increasing radius. The latter expectation is\nconsistent with the flat M/L profiles reported for\na sample of 59 nearby clusters analyzed by\nKatgert, Biviano & Mazure (2003).\nThe expectation of a flat M/L profile for a\ncluster, which is a result of the dependence of the\ncontribution of the graviton scattering force on\ntotal mass of the system, comes in extremely\nhandy in explaining the flatness of the observed\nX-ray emitting gas temperature profiles with\nradius. Aguirre et al. (2001) point out that for gas\nin hydrostatic equilibrium MOND predicts that\n(45)\n\n\fIn the realm of quantum gravity the equation\n(45) becomes\n(46)\nThus in quantum gravity T(r) is independent\nof radius and thus consistent with the reported\nisothermality of the X-ray emitting gas, which is\npractically independent of radius.\n\nThe obtained relations (53) and (54) are fully\nconsistent with the predictions of quantum\ngravity.\nAs far as \u03c3v-T relation is concerned there\nseems to be a consensus in the literature that \u03c3v\n\u221d T~0.6 (see e.g. Xue & Wu 2000). The reported\n\u03c3v-T relation is consistent with the expectation of\nquantum gravity that \u03c3v \u221d T0.5, which follows\nfrom the facts that \u03c3v \u221d M0.25 and T \u221d Mtotal0.5.\n\n11.2 Scaling Relations\nAnother advantage of quantum gravity is that\nit reproduces the observed scaling relations for\nclusters that differ from the expectations of selfsimilarity in self-gravitating systems described\nby Newtonian dynamics.\nNamely, self-similarity implies that (see e.g.\nEttori et al. 2003)\nL \u221d T2\n\n(47)\n\nMdyn \u221d T1.5\n\n(48)\n\nIn the same time Ettori et al. (2003) reports\nL \u221d Mdyn1.88\nL\u221dT\n\n\u00b10.42\n\n3.7\u00b11.0\n\nMdyn \u221d T1.98\n\nAs individual gravitating bodies produce\ngravitational field fluctuations Universe as a\nwhole becomes a source of energy fluctuations\n(i.e. gravitons). In expanding universe\nfluctuations caused by individual bodies will\nrecede thus producing an accelerating drag\nassociated with expansion. By analogy with the\nequation (5) the expansion-induced acceleration\naexp can be expressed as\n\n(49)\n(50)\n\n\u00b10.30\n\n12. DARK ENERGY AS EFFECT OF\nEXPANSION\n\n(51)\n\nI specifically used the designation Mdyn for\ntotal dynamical mass inferred from the virial\ntheorem as Mdyn = v2r/G. to avoid confusion with\nthe total mass Mtotal employed in the equations\nfor quantum gravity. There is, however, a simple\nlink between the two quantities: since the virial\ntheorem implies that Mdyn \u221d v2 and in quantum\ngravity\nthen\n(52)\nSubstituting Mdyn with Mtotal in the observed\nscaling relations (49)-(51) one obtains that\nT \u221d Mtotal0.5\n\n(53)\n\nL \u221d Mtotal\n\n(54)\n\n(55)\nwhere l is a characteristic size of the\nuniversal gravitons and v is a particle velocity\nrelative to the flow of expansion (if the rate of\nexpansion at present time is characterized by the\nHubble law then the particle velocity v in\nequation (55) is the particle's peculiar velocity\nrelative to the Hubble flow).\nThus the energy of expansion is\n(56)\nBecause the energy of expansion (56) is nonzero and its effect is repulsive when the Universe\nexpands such energy will act as cosmological\nterm:\n(57)\nwhere \u039b0 is constant.\n\n\f12. COSMOLOGICAL INFLATION AS\nEFFECT OF EXPANSION\nSince within the framework of quantum\ngravity the cosmological constant is non-zero\ndue to the effect of the gravitational energy\nfluctuations, the equation for the rate of the\nexpansion of the Universe can be written as\n(58)\nTo analyze the expansion of the early\nUniverse it is necessary to determine the\ndependence of the characteristic size l of the\ngravitons on the size of the Universe R, i.e. the\nfunction l(R). Clearly, when the density of the\nUniverse is low l(R) should increase as R in line\nwith the postulated l(r)=l0r law for a single\ngravitating body. When the density of the\nUniverse is high and distances between bodies\nare much smaller than l0 the function of l(R) will\nbe quite different, however. To determine the\nbehavior of l(R) I have conducted a simulation of\nan expanding Universe containing 106 quantum\ngravitational sources (1) and sampled the\nresulting l(R) function. The resulting function\nl(R) is characterized by the following two limits:\n(59)\nFor the magnitude of fluctuations the\nexpected R-1 law was confirmed:\n(60)\nThe equation (59) tells us that the\ncharacteristic size of gravitons stays constant\nuntil the Universe blows up to a sufficiently large\nradius (or the mass-density drops below a certain\ncritical value) and then gradually transforms into\na linear growth, which becomes an exact linear\nlaw when the Universe is sufficiently sparse. The\ncritical radius R0 below which characteristic size\nof gravitons remains constant regardless of R\n\ndepends on the choice of the constant\nin\nequation (1), which defines the quantum\ngravitational intrinsic fluctuation frequency.\nFrom the discussion above it follows that \u039b \u2248\nconst for small R but the matter density drops as\n\u03c1 \u221d R-3 as a result of expansion. Since the matter\ndensity drops so rapidly it is reasonable to expect\nthat the early Universe was dominated by\ncosmological constant, i.e. \u039b >> 4G(\u03c1 + p)\nassuming that the initial matter pressure p was\nsmall. Based on these arguments the equation\n(58) for the early Universe can be rewritten as\n(61)\nSince\n\nwhen \u03b3 >> v2 (i.e.\n2\n\nunder the assumption of the low initial pressure),\nthe solution to the equation (61) is exponential\nexpansion:\n(62)\nThus in the early Universe gravitational\nenergy fluctuations act as an inflaton field, which\nis ultimately responsible for the exponential\ninflation. According to inflation theories such\nexponential inflation is necessary to produce flat\nand homogeneous Universe free of topological\ndefects.\nNote that when the Universe becomes\nsufficiently large l(R) \u221d R and the rate of\nexpansion slows down from exponential to a \u03c4 2\npower law expansion:\n(63)\n(64)\nThus the inflationary expansion epoch will\ncome to an end completely when \u039b drops below\n4G(\u03c1 + p). This transition will occur in part\nbecause of the growth of particle kinetic energy\n\n\f(i.e. matter pressure) and because of the R-1\ndecrease in the graviton energy U0 \u2013 recall the\nequation (10) stating that \u03b3 \u221dU0, which is\nequivalent to \u03b3 \u221dR-1. Thus as the radius of the\nUniverse R increases with time the assumption\nthat \u03b3 >> v2 will be violated and replaced with\nanother limit of \u03b3 << v2. At the transition the\ntunneling probability will cease to be in the\nneighborhood of 1 and will start slipping towards\nzero rapidly. Therefore in the grand scheme of\nthings after a brief period of exponential inflation\nfollowed by a long period of power law inflation\nwill come an epoch of steady expansion\ncharacterized by the relaxation of \u039b down to\nzero:\n2\n\n2\n\n(65)\nAnd the rate of expansion is\n(66)\nNote that \u03b3 \u221d U0(R)l(R) \u221d R-1 during the\nperiod of exponential inflation and \u03b3 \u2248 const\nafterwards. Thus the decrease in the value of \u039b is\ncaused both by rapid decrease in the energy of\nthe gravitons U0 and by the increase in the\nkinetic energy of expanding matter.\nObservationally\nnon-zero\ncosmological\nconstant was detected in the recent high-red shift\nsupernovae studies (e.g. Perlmutter et al. 1998;\nfor an overview see Filippenko 2003) and in the\nWMAP analysis of the CMB anisotropy (for an\noverview see Lahanas, Mavromatos &\nNanopoulos 2003). Theoretically the prediction\nof quantum gravity that initially significant\ncosmological constant is currently relaxing to\nzero at least as fast as fast as R-1 is favorable for\ncosmological inflation theories as it provides a\nnatural mechanism for the exit from the\ninflationary epoch.\nLastly, in a counterpoint to MOND I would\nlike to mention that MOND fails to make\nunambiguous and consistent predictions on\ncosmological scale mostly due to the difficulty of\n\nselecting relevant acceleration frames (Scott et.\nal. 2001), whereas quantum gravity predicts\nexponential / power law inflation in early epoch\nand non-zero yet vanishing cosmological\nconstant at present time consistent with the\nexpectations of the cosmological inflation\nparadigm.\n13. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\nA theory of quantum gravity is proposed in\nwhich gravitational energy fluctuations \u2013 or\ngravitons \u2013 play key role in stellar dynamics by\nexerting a complimentary graviton scattering\nforce in addition to Newtonian gravity. The\nadditional force is small and is generally\nsignificant in the limit of low orbital\naccelerations. The latter observation results in\ncertain similarity between the proposed the\ntheory of quantum gravity and Milgrom's\nMOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND).\nUnlike MOND, however, the proposed theory\nquantum gravity does not suffer from the\nviolation of cornerstone Newton Laws and\navoids the difficulty in X-ray cluster cores with\nwhere MOND still requires unseen matter and\nfails to account for flat temperature profile of the\nX-ray emitting gas. Similarly to MOND, the\nproposed theory of quantum gravity successfully\naccounts for M/L ratios of various stellar systems\nincluding dwarf spheroid galaxies, dwarf,\nordinary and giant elliptic galaxies, and galaxy\nclusters. Although a postulates in MOND, flat\nrotational curves of spiral galaxies, Tully-Fisher\nand Faber-Jackson laws follow from the base\nprinciples of quantum gravity. Also, the\nproposed theory of quantum gravity successfully\nexplains the fundamental plane of elliptic\ngalaxies, which can not be described by a virial\ntheorem applied with the accepted CDM model\nwithout requiring ad hoc systematic effects, as\nwell as scaling relations for X-ray clusters, which\nare not consistent with the principle of selfsimilarity arising from the standard Newtonian\ngravity / CDM scenario. Lastly, primordial\ninflation\nand\nvanishing\nbut\nnon-zero\n\n\fcosmological constant \u2013 or dark energy \u2013 can be\ntraced as effects of the universal graviton\nscattering force induced by expanding matter.\nIt is remarkable that such a wide variety of\nphenomena can be derived from two very basic\nprinciple of matter particles tunneling through /\nscattering from the gravitational energy\nfluctuations. With this encouraging results I call\nfor further investigation of properties of the\ngraviton field and for detailed quantitative\nanalysis of the effects of quantum gravity.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nI thank Moti Milgrom for kindly maintaining\nan email correspondence with me, which\nalthough as brief as it was enabled me to grasp\nthe breadth of success and nature of difficulties\nof MOND, understanding of which was essential\nfor shaping the theory of quantum gravity. I also\nwould like to thank Joe Hershberger, George\nFomitchev and Veronica Grigorashvily for\nhelpful discussion and support in preparing this\npaper.\n\n\fREFERENCES\nAbramovici, A., & Vager, Z. 1986, Phys.
