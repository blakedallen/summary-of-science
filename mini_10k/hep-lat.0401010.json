Introduction\nInvestigation of the QCD phase transition at finite temperature and density\nis one of the most important subjects in hadron physics. To create the quark\ngluon plasma (QGP) phase, in which quarks and gluons are deconfined\nand the chiral symmetry is restored, the high energy heavy ion collision\nexperiments have been performed and the RHIC experiment at BNL is\nin progress. The J/\u03c8 suppression has been considered as one of the most\nimportant signals of formation of QGP. However, theoretical understanding\nof charmonium at finite temperature and density is not sufficient to draw\na conclusive scenario.\nWe investigate the charmonium properties at finite temperature using\nlattice QCD simulations which enable us to incorporate the nonperturbative effects of QCD. Observations of spatial correlations between quark\n\u2217 Talk\n\npresented by H.

The latter includes the constrained curve fitting\n6\nin addition to the standard \u03c72 fit. To circumvent severe restriction of\ndegrees of freedom in Euclidean temporal direction, we employ anisotropic\nlattices on which temporal lattice spacing is finer than the spatial one (for\nour setup of the anisotropic lattices, see Ref. 7 ). At this stage, the simulations are performed in the quenched approximation (without dynamical\nquark effects). To enhance the contribution from low energy part in the\nspectral function, we apply the smearing technique by spatially extending\nthe meson operators. The details of this work has been presented in Ref.5 .\n\n2. Analysis procedures\nThe spectral function contains direct information on the structure of the\nP\nmesonic correlator, C(t) = ~x hO(~x, t)O\u2020 (0, 0)i. Recently the maximum\nentropy method (MEM) has been successfully applied to the extraction of\nthe spectral function from lattice data at T = 0 without assuming specific\nform 3 . However, its applicability to problems at T > 0 is not straightforward, because available physical range of C(t) as well as number of data\npoints are severely limited. In such a circumstance, we need in some way\nto check the applicability of the method. Once a presumable form of the\nspectral function is known by MEM, other analysis procedures, such as the\nstandard \u03c72 fit may provide more quantitative information 4,5 . We therefore propose to use the \u03c72 fit analysis in combination with MEM 5 . As\na more sophisticated alternative to the standard \u03c72 fit, we also apply the\nconstrained curve fitting 6 assuming several peaks with finite widths. In\nthis method, one can add prior knowledge for the spectral function and\nthus can treat functional forms with numbers of parameters (even) more\nthan the number of data points.\nTo verify the applicability of these methods at T > 0, we require that\nthey correctly work for the correlators at T = 0 with restricted numbers of\ndata points corresponding to the cases at T > 0. As we will see in the next\nsection, MEM applied to the correlators of the point operators does not\nmeet this condition with present level of statistics (O(500) configurations).\nWe therefore apply the smearing technique which enhances the low energy part of the spectral function. For the correlators smeared with the\n\n\fNovember 19, 2018\n\n22:39\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Proceedings\n\nproc \u0307conf03\n\n3\n500\n\n500\npoint\n\npoint\n\ntmax=48\ntmax=24\ntmax=16\ntmax=12\n\n400\n\n500conf.\nPS\n\n2\n\n200\n\n200\n\n100\n\n100\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\u03c9\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\ntmax=48, PS\n\n300\nA(\u03c9)/\u03c9\n\nA(\u03c9)/\u03c9\n\n2\n\n300\n\ntsep=1\ntsep=2\ntsep=4\ntsep=8\n\n400\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\u03c9\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\nFigure 1.

Although the features of the collective mode such as the mass and\nwidth are unchanged by the smearing, the smearing can produce a mimic\npeak structure in the spectral function 8 . This possibility is examined by\nobserving the correlators smeared with a narrower function (half-smeared\ncorrelators). The dependence of extracted spectral function on the smearing function is compared with that of correlators composed of free quarks.\n3. Numerical results\nThe numerical simulation is performed on lattices with the spatial lattice\ncutoff a\u22121\n\u2243 2 GeV and the anisotropy a\u03c3 /a\u03c4 = 4 in the quenched ap\u03c3\nproximation 7 . The lattice sizes are 203 \u00d7 Nt , where Nt = 160 (T \u2243 0), 32\n(T \u2243 0.9Tc), and 26 (T \u2243 1.1Tc ). The numbers of configurations are 500 at\nT \u2243 0 and 1000 at T > 0. Nt = 28 roughly corresponds to the transition\ntemperature. The quark field is described by the O(a) improved Wilson\naction with the tree-level tadpole-improvement. The hopping parameter is\nchosen so that the charmonium spectrum is roughly reproduced.\n3.1. Results at T = 0\nLet us start with the analysis of the point correlators at T = 0. We apply\nMEM to them with restricted numbers of degrees of freedom. The results\nwith two types of such restrictions are displayed in Fig. 1. The left panel\nshows the dependence of the result on tmax , the maximum t of the correlator\nused in the analysis. This case corresponds to the situation at T > 0. MEM\nfails to reproduce even the lowest peak for tmax \u2264 16.

These results indicate that the physical region of the correlator\nas well as the number of the degrees of freedom is important for MEM\nto work correctly. The required region of C(t) in the above analysis is\ntmax > O(0.5fm), which is not fulfilled around T \u2243 Tc .\nThis is why we apply the smearing technique. The results of MEM for\nthe smeared correlators are stable under the above two kinds of restriction\nfor tmax of interest; at least the lowest peak position is correctly reproduced\nwhile the resolution becomes worse as tmax decreases. Since the smearing\nsuppresses the high frequency region of the spectral function, we focus only\non the lowest peak of the spectral function in the following analysis.\nThe results of the \u03c72 fit and the constrained curve fitting for the smeared\ncorrelators are consistent with the results of MEM and stable under the\nsame restriction of tmax . In the following, we concentrate on the results of\nthe smeared correlators.\n3.2. Results at T > 0\nAt T \u2243 0.9Tc , the result of MEM for the smeared correlator indicates that\nthe low energy structure of the spectral function is well represented by a\n\n\fNovember 19, 2018\n\n22:39\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Proceedings\n\nproc \u0307conf03\n\n5\n\nstrong peak corresponding to a meson state. We then apply the \u03c72 fit analysis assuming double-pole, single relativistic Breit-Wigner (BW) type form\n4\n, and BW+pole form (the pole function is to subtract the excited state\ncontribution). The analysis indicates that the lowest peak of the spectral\nfunction is well represented by the pole form with the width consistent with\nzero. The mass is almost the same as at T = 0: no mass shift is observed\nat T \u2243 0.9Tc. The result of the constrained curve fitting is consistent with\nthat of the standard \u03c72 fit.\nAt T \u2243 1.1Tc the result of MEM still exhibits a peak structure around\nthe same energy region as at T < Tc . Therefore we perform the same kind\nof the \u03c72 fit analysis as at T < Tc . The fits to the 2-pole ansatz and to\nthe Breit-Wigner type ans\u00e4tze give inconsistent results, and the latter fits\nindicate that the spectral function has a peak with almost the same mass\nas at T < Tc and the width of order of 200 MeV, as shown in Fig. 2. The\nresult depends on the smearing function only slightly, in contrast to the\nfree quark case, and hence we conclude that this is a physically significant\nstructure. Similar result is obtained with the constrained curve fitting.\nThese results are in accord with our earlier analysis of the spatial correlation\nbetween quark and antiquark 2 and imply that quasi-stable bound-statelike structures exist at T \u2243 1.1Tc . Similar results have also been reported\nby other groups 9,10 .\nThe simulation has been done on NEC SX-5 at Research Center for Nuclear Physics, Osaka University and Hitachi SR8000 at KEK (High Energy\nAccelerator Research Organization).
