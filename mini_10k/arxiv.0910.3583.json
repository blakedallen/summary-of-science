Galenko et al. (see [17, 18, 19, 20]) have proposed to modify the celebrated Cahn-Hilliard equation (see [10], cf. also the review [31]) in order to account for nonequilibrium\n1\n\n\feffects in spinodal decomposition (cf. [9], see also [24, 29]). The basic form of this modification reads\n\u03b5utt + ut \u2212 \u2206(\u2212\u2206u + f (u)) = g,\n\n(1.1)\n\non \u03a9 \u00d7 (0, +\u221e), \u03a9 being a bounded smooth subset of RN , N \u2264 3. Here \u03b5 \u2208 (0, 1], f is the derivative\nof a nonconvex potential (e.g., f (r) = r(r2 \u2212 1)) and g is a given (time-independent) function.\nThe longtime behavior of equation (1.1) already drew the attention of mathematicians (see\nthe pioneering [14], cf. also the more recent [7, 21, 23, 35, 36]). However, all these contributions\nwere essentially devoted to the one-dimensional case which can now be considered well known. There\nalso have been further works devoted to higher dimensions (see [22, 27], cf. also [13, 34] for memory\neffects) but they are all characterized by the presence of viscosity terms which imply the instantaneous\nregularization of solutions. This is not the case of (1.1).\nThe mere existence of energy bounded solutions (see Def. 2.1 for this terminology) was proven\nin [33] for N = 3. We recall that this work was mainly devoted to the longtime behavior of such\nsolutions based on the multi-valued semigroup approach to the problems without uniqueness developed\nby A.V. Babin and M.I. Vishik [3] (see also [2], [5, 6] and references therein). The existence result\nwas then generalized to a nonisothermal system with memory in [28]. Nevertheless, the existence\nof energy bounded solutions is not a delicate issue and can be carried out by means of a standard\nGalerkin procedure. In addition, both the quoted results were proven supposing f of cubic controlled\ngrowth, but the existence also holds when f has a generic polynomial growth (cf. Thm. 2.2 below).\nOn the contrary, uniqueness of such solutions is much harder to prove. This was eventually done in\n[26] for N = 2, assuming f of cubic controlled growth, along with a number of other results (e.g.,\nexistence of smoother solutions, global attractors and exponential attractors). Uniqueness of energy\nbounded solutions is still open in the case N = 3 (and also when N = 2 for supercubic f ). More\nrecently, an extension to a version with memory has been studied in [12]. However, the existence of\nstronger solutions was shown in [25] for \u03b5 small enough. This fact enabled the authors to construct\na dynamical system acting on a suitable phase space (depending on \u03b5) and to prove the existence of\nthe global attractor as well as of an exponential attractor.\nSpeaking of global attractors in the cases N = 2 and N = 3, the results obtained in [26]\nand [25] are not fully satisfactory. Indeed, in the former case we proved the existence of the global\nattractors both for energy bounded solutions and for \"quasi-strong\" solutions (see Def. 2.1 again),\nbut we could not say whether they coincide. In the case N = 3 we only established the existence of\nthe global attractor for quasi-strong solutions, while the unique available result on global attractors\nfor energy bounded solutions was in [33]. Inspired by [37], here we intend to bridge this gap.\nFirst, in Sections 2 and 3, we construct the proper attractor for the energy solutions of (1.1).\nSince we do not have the uniqueness for the energy solutions (in the 3D case as well as in the 2D\ncase with the super-cubic growth rate), we use the so-called trajectory dynamical system approach\ndeveloped by V.V. Chepyzhov and M.I. Vishik (see [11]) and construct the so-called trajectory attractor associated with energy solutions of problem (1.1). However, the class of all energy solutions\nwhich satisfy the weakened form of energy inequality used in [11] in their construction of trajectory\nattractors for damped hyperbolic equations is too large for our purposes and we restrict ourselves to\nconsider only the energy solutions which can be obtained by Galerkin approximations (analogously to\n[37], see also [33]). Note that, although the trajectory attractor constructed here is very close (and\neven formally equivalent) to the generalized attractor obtained in [33] via the multi-valued approach,\nit is much more convenient for our further investigation.\nThen, in Section 4, we establish that each complete bounded solution belonging to the trajectory attractor is a strong solution to (1.1) at least for all times smaller than a time sufficiently close\nto \u2212\u221e. This kind of backward smoothness was firstly obtained in [37] for damped wave equations\nwith supercritical nonlinearities. Here, the proof is however based on partly different and more simple\narguments (see Thm. 4.1).\nThe backward smoothness is the basic ingredient which allows us to show (in Section 5):\n(i) if N = 2 (and f has cubic controlled growth) the global attractor for energy bounded solutions\ncoincides with the one for quasi-strong solutions (and, in particular, it is smooth);\n(ii) if N = 3 the trajectory attractor consists of complete bounded strong solutions if \u03b5 is small enough.\nThus, in both cases, we have the asymptotic regularization of energy solutions.\n2\n\n\fIn Section 6, in both cases mentioned above, we establish that every energy solution regularizes\nexponentially as t \u2192 +\u221e, i.e., such solutions can be split into the sum of two functions, one of which\nis smooth and bounded and the other tends to zero exponentially as time tends to infinity. This result\nseems new even for the well-known damped semi-linear wave equation with supercritical nonlinearity\n(a similar property has been shown in [37] only under the additional assumptions that all equilibria\nare hyperbolic). In addition, we present an alternative approach to demonstrate the exponential\nasymptotic regularization when \u03b5 > 0 is small enough. This method does not use the backward\nregularization or exploit the global Lyapunov functional and can be therefore applied, e.g., to nonautonomous equations or to the case of unbounded domains.\nFinally, in Section 7, taking advantage of the exponential regularization and the transitivity\nof exponential attraction, we prove that, again in both the above cases, the energy solutions approach\nexponentially fast the exponential attractor for strong solutions which has been constructed in [25]\nand [26] . Thus, this strong exponential attractor is the exponential attractor for the energy solutions\nas well. In addition, we use the obtained exponential regularization to solve one problem for the 2D\ncase which remained open in [26], namely, the dissipativity in the intermediate phase space of weak\nsolutions (between the energy and strong solutions) with no restrictions on \u03b5.\nTo conclude the introduction, we note that, although we endow equation (1.1) with the boundary and initial conditions\nu(t) = \u2206u(t) = 0,\nu(0) = u0 ,\n\non \u2202\u03a9, t > 0,\n\nut (0) = u1 ,\n\nin \u03a9,\n\n(1.2)\n(1.3)\n\nother boundary conditions, like no-flux or periodic, could also be handled (see [7, 14, 21]) with only\ntechnical modifications.\n\n2\n\nFunctional setup and existence of solutions\n\nLet us set H := L2 (\u03a9) and denote by (*, *) the scalar product both in H and in H \u00d7 H, and by k * k\nthe related norm. The symbol k * kX will indicate the norm in the generic (real) Banach space X.\nNext, we set V := H01 (\u03a9), so that V \u2032 = H \u22121 (\u03a9) is the topological dual of V . The duality between V \u2032\nand V will be noted by h*, *i. The space V is endowed with the scalar product\nZ\n\u2207v * \u2207z, \u2200 v, z \u2208 V,\n(2.1)\n((v, z)) :=\n\u03a9\n\nand the corresponding induced norm. We shall denote by A the Riesz operator on V associated with\nthe norm above, namely,\nZ\n\u2207v * \u2207z, \u2200 v, z \u2208 V.\n(2.2)\nA : V \u2192 V \u2032,\nhAv, zi = ((v, z)) =\n\u03a9\n\nAbusing notation slightly, we shall also indicate by the same letter A the restriction of the operator\ndefined in (2.2) to the set D(A) = H 2 (\u03a9) \u2229 V , i.e., the unbounded operator defined as\nA = \u2212\u2206\n\nwith domain D(A) = H 2 (\u03a9) \u2229 V \u2282 L2 (\u03a9).\n\n(2.3)\n\nStarting from A one can define the family of Hilbert spaces\nH 2s = D(As ),\n\ns \u2208 R,\n\nwith scalar product (As *, As *). It is well known that H s1 \u2282 H s2 with dense and compact immersion\nwhen s1 > s2 . Then, we introduce the scale of Hilbert spaces\n\u221a\ns+1\ns\u22121\nVs\u03b5 := D(A 2 ) \u00d7 \u03b5D(A 2 ),\n(2.4)\nso that we have, in particular, V0\u03b5 = V \u00d7 V \u2032 and, analogously, V1\u03b5 = (H 2 (\u03a9) \u2229 V ) \u00d7 H.

Note that f can be a polynomial of arbitrarily large odd\ndegree with positive leading coefficient. If we indicate as F the potential of f (i.e., a suitable primitive\nof f ), we can always suppose that\n\u03ba\nF (r) \u2265 \u2212 r2 ,\n(2.9)\n2\nfor some \u03ba < \u03bb1 . By (2.7), we also have that F is \u03bb-convex. When p > 2 we will need to suppose\n\u03b4 > 0 in (2.7).\nFinally, we let\ng \u2208 H.\n(2.10)\nSystem (1.1)-(1.3) can then be reformulated as\nProblem P\u03b5 .

Actually, we will consider in the sequel both local and global in time solutions. In the\nsequel we will frequently write U for the couple (u, ut ) and U0 for (u0 , u1 ) (the same convention will\nbe kept for other letters, e.g., we will write V = (v, vt )). Moreover, for the sake of brevity, solutions\nwill be sometimes noted simply as u, or as U , rather than as (u, ut ).\nSpeaking of regularity, we can now introduce the energy associated with (1.1) as\nZ\n1\n\u03b5\n2\nE\u03b5 : V0 \u2192 R,\nE\u03b5 (u, v) := k(u, v)k0 +\nF (u) \u2212 hg, A\u22121 ui.\n(2.13)\n2\n\u03a9\nAssumptions (2.8) and (2.10) suffice to guarantee that E\u03b5 is finite for all (u, v) \u2208 V1\u03b5 . However, if p > 2\nthen \u03b4 > 0 in (2.7) is needed, if (u, v) \u2208 V0\u03b5 . For this reason we introduce the function space\n\b\nX0\u03b5 := (u, v) \u2208 V0\u03b5 : u \u2208 Lp+4 (\u03a9) ,\n(2.14)\nwhich is endowed with the graph metrics. For instance, with some abuse of language, we will write\nk(u, v)k2X0\u03b5 := k(u, v)k2V0\u03b5 + kukp+4\nLp+4 (\u03a9) .\n\n(2.15)\n\nIt is then clear from (2.8) that E\u03b5 is locally finite in X0\u03b5 . Of course, thanks to (2.6), E\u03b5 is in any case\nbounded from below on the whole V0\u03b5 . The above discussion leads to the following definition (see\n[25, 26]).\nDefinition 2.1. We say that a solution to P\u03b5 defined on some time interval (0, T ) is an energy bounded\nsolution, or, more concisely, energy solution, if (u, ut ) \u2208 L\u221e (0, T ; V0\u03b5 ) and E\u03b5 (u, ut ) \u2208 L\u221e (0, T ). If\n(u, ut ) \u2208 L\u221e (0, T ; V1\u03b5 ), we say instead that u is a weak solution. If (u, ut ) \u2208 L\u221e (0, T ; V2\u03b5 ), u is named\nquasi-strong solution, while u is a strong solution if (u, ut ) \u2208 L\u221e (0, T ; V3\u03b5 ).\nThus, for energy solutions, (2.11) has to be interpreted as an equation in D(A\u22122 ) in the case\np+4\nwhen p > 2 (and hence \u03b4 > 0). Indeed, in this case f (u(t)) \u2208 L p+3 (\u03a9) \u2282 D(A\u22121 ) for almost any\nt \u2208 (0, T ). If p \u2264 2, then of course we can say more: it is now f (u(t)) \u2208 L6/5 (\u03a9) \u2282 V \u2032 and (2.11)\nholds in D(A\u22123/2 ). In any case, we can say that any energy solution U = (u, ut ) lies in L\u221e (0, T ; X0\u03b5 ).\nPassing to weak solutions, then (2.11) holds in D(A\u22121 ) since it is now f (u(t)) \u2208 H, thanks to the\n4\n\n\fembedding H 2 (\u03a9) \u0592\u2192 C(\u03a9). For the same reason, (2.11) can be interpreted as a V \u2032 -equation for\nquasi-strong solutions, and, of course, for strong solutions it holds almost everywhere in \u03a9 \u00d7 (0, T ).\nObserve that, despite of the name, energy bounded solutions are weaker than weak solutions.\nWe also notice that a comparison in (2.11) gives that utt \u2208 L\u221e (0, T, H) for strong solutions,\n\u221e\nutt \u2208 L (0, T, V \u2032 ) for quasi-strong solutions, utt \u2208 L\u221e (0, T, D(A\u22121 )) for weak solutions, and utt \u2208\n0\nL\u221e (0, T, D(A\u22122 )) for energy solutions. This immediately leads to U = (u, ut ) \u2208 Cw\n([0, T ]; Vi\u03b5 ) with,\n0\nrespectively, i = 3, 2, 1, 0, where Cw ([0, T ]; X) is defined as (X being a real Banach space)\n\b\n0\nCw\n([0, T ]; X) := v \u2208 L\u221e (0, T ; X) : h\u03c6, v(*)i \u2208 C 0 ([0, T ]), \u2200\u03c6 \u2208 X \u2032 .\n\nTherefore solutions can be evaluated pointwise in time and initial conditions (2.12) in Vi\u03b5 , i = 3, 2, 1, 0,\nhave a well-defined meaning in all the cases.\nWe conclude the section by stating the existence theorem\nTheorem 2.2. Let the assumptions (2.6)-(2.8) and (2.10) hold, and let\n(u0 , u1 ) \u2208 X0 .\n\n(2.16)\n\nThen, if either p \u2264 2 in (2.7)-(2.8) or \u03b4 > 0 in (2.7), there exists at least one global in time energy\nsolution to Problem P\u03b5 , which additionally satisfies the following dissipation inequality\nZ +\u221e\nkU (t)k2X0\u03b5 +\nkut (s)k2V \u2032 ds \u2264 CkU0 k2X0\u03b5 e\u2212\u03bat + C(1 + kgk2 ), \u2200t \u2265 \u03c4 \u2265 0,\n(2.17)\nt\n\nwhere the positive constants \u03ba and C are independent of \u03b5.\nFrom now on we let the assumptions of Theorem 2.2 hold, unless otherwise specified. Moreover,\nwe will not stress the dependence on \u03b5 till the final section.\nAlthough the proof of Theorem 2.2 is standard, we report here below some highlights for the\nreader's convenience.\nProof.\nThe proof is essentially based on the Faedo-Galerkin scheme described in the next section\nand on a couple of estimates which, for simplicity, are performed here by working directly (albeit\nformally) on the original problem rather than on its approximation. Firstly, testing (2.11) by A\u22121 ut ,\nwe easily derive the energy equality\nd\nE\u03b5 (U ) + kut k2V \u2032 = 0\ndt\n\n(2.18)\n\n(in fact, the above is a true equality just at the regularized (Galerkin) level, but will turn into an\ninequality when taking the limit). Second, multiplying (2.11) by A\u22121 u, we get\ni\n1\ndh\n\u03b5hut , A\u22121 ui + kuk2V \u2032 \u2212 \u03b5kut k2V \u2032 + kuk2V + (f (u), u) \u2212 (g, A\u22121 u) = 0.\ndt\n2\n\nWe then notice that a combination of assumptions (2.6)-(2.7) gives\nZ\nkuk2V + (f (u), u) \u2265 \u03ba1 kuk2V + \u03ba2\nF (u) \u2212 c \u2265 \u03ba3 kuk2V \u2212 c,\n\n(2.19)\n\n(2.20)\n\n\u03a9\n\nfor suitable positive constants \u03bai , i = 1, 2, 3, only depending on \u03bb1 and \u03bb. In particular, thanks to\n(2.6), \u03ba2 can be chosen so small that the latter inequality holds even in case \u03b4 = 0 in (2.7).\nUsing (2.20), it is a standard matter to verify that, multiplying (2.19) by a (suitably small)\nconstant \u03b1 > 0, and adding the result to (2.18), gives, for some \u03ba > 0,\nd\nY\u03b5 + \u03baY\u03b5 \u2264 c,\ndt\n\n(2.21)\n\nwhere we noted as Y\u03b5 the functional obtained by taking E\u03b5 and summing to it \u03b1 times the terms in\nsquare brackets in (2.19) and adding also a further quantity of the form C\u2217 (1 + kgk2 ), where C\u2217 > 0\n5\n\n\fis a suitable constant. Actually, by (2.15), it is easy to check that, if C\u2217 is taken large enough, then\nfor some positive \u03bai , i = 4, . . . , 7, and c > 0 there holds\n2\n2\n2\n\u03ba4 kU k2V0\u03b5 + \u03b4kukp+4\nLp+4 (\u03a9) \u2264 \u03ba5 E\u03b5 \u2264 Y\u03b5 \u2264 \u03ba6 E\u03b5 + c(1 + kgkH ) \u2264 \u03ba7 kU kX0\u03b5 + c(1 + kgkH ).\n\n(2.22)\n\nThus, integrating (2.21) over (0, t) and using (2.22), we obtain an inequality analogue to (2.17), but\nwithout the integral term on the left hand side. To get a control of it, it is however sufficient to go\nback to (2.18), integrate it over (t, +\u221e), and refer once more to (2.22).\nOnce one has obtained (2.17) at the approximated level, it is then a standard procedure to pass\nto the limit. For instance, assumptions (2.7)-(2.8) and the Aubin-Lions compactness lemma entail\nweak star convergence of f (u) to the right limit, holding in the space L\u221e (0, T ; L6/5(\u03a9)) if p \u2264 2, and\np+4\nin L\u221e (0, T ; L p+3 (\u03a9)) if p > 2 (and hence \u03b4 > 0). Then, also (2.17) passes to the limit inferior by\nstandard semicontinuity arguments. The proof is complete.\nRemark 2.3. It is not difficult to realize that Theorem 2.2 still holds when f \u2208 C 0 (R; R) with\nf (0) = 0 satisfies, in place of (2.6)-(2.8) and for some p \u2208 (0, \u221e),\n\u2203 M0 \u2265 0 : |f (r)| \u2264 M0 (1 + |r|p+3 ), \u2200 r \u2208 R\n\n\u2203 \u03bb0 \u2208 [0, +\u221e) and \u03b40 \u2208 (0, \u221e) : f (r)r \u2265 \u2212\u03bb0 + \u03b40 |r|p+4 , \u2200 r \u2208 R.\n\nIf p \u2264 2, the last condition can be replaced by (2.6). These assumptions on f also suffice to establish\nthe existence of the trajectory attractor (see Theorem 3.4 and related corollaries in the next section).\n\n3\n\nThe trajectory dynamical system\n\nThe existence of a global energy solution (see Theorem 2.2) can be proven by means of a FaedoGalerkin procedure similar to the one used in [37] for the damped semilinear wave equation with a\nsupercritical nonlinearity. In particular, if we indicate by Pn the orthoprojector constructed with the\nfirst n eigenfunctions of A and we set\nU0n = (un0 , un1 ) = (Pn u0 , Pn u1 ) \u2208 V0n := (Pn H)2 ,\n\n(3.1)\n\nthen it is not difficult to prove that the corresponding approximating solution U n (t) = (un (t), unt (t))\nto\n\u03b5untt + unt + A(Aun + Pn f (un )) = g n := Pn g,\nn\n\nu |t=0 =\n\nun0 ,\n\nunt |t=0\n\n=\n\nalso satisfies the analogue of (2.17), namely,\nZ \u221e\nkunt (s)k2V \u2032 ds \u2264 CkU n (\u03c4 )k2X0\u03b5 e\u2212\u03ba(t\u2212\u03c4 ) + C(1 + kgk2H ),\nkU n (t)k2X0\u03b5 +\nt\n\n(3.2)\n\nun1 ,\n\n(3.3)\n\n\u2200t \u2265 \u03c4 \u2265 0.\n\n(3.4)\n\nFrom now on, we restrict ourselves to consider only those of energy bounded solutions which can be\nobtained as a weak limit of the corresponding Galerkin approximations.\nDefinition 3.1. An energy bounded solution U (t) := (u(t), ut (t)) of problem (1.1) is an energy\nsolution if it can be obtained as a weak limit of a subsequence of solutions Un (t) to the Galerkin\napproximation equations (3.2) which satisfy (3.3).\nSince the uniqueness of the energy solutions is not known so far, we use the so-called trajectory\napproach developed in [11] in order to describe the long-time behavior of such solutions. To this end,\nwe first need to define the trajectory phase space associated with energy solutions of problem (1.1)\nand the trajectory dynamical system on it.\n\n6\n\n\fDefinition 3.2. We define the trajectory phase space K\u03b5+ \u2208 L\u221e (R+ , X0\u03b5 ) as a set of all energy\nsolutions U of problem (1.1) associated with all possible initial data U (0) \u2208 X0\u03b5 . Namely, we set\nn\nK\u03b5+ := U \u2208 L\u221e (R+ ; X0\u03b5 ) : \u2203{U nk (t)} solving (3.2) \u2212 (3.3) such that\n(3.5)\no\nU (0) = [X0\u03b5 ]w \u2212 lim U nk (0) and U = \u0398+ \u2212 lim U nk\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\n\u03b5 w\nand we endow K\u03b5+ with the topology of \u0398+ := [L\u221e\nloc ([0, \u221e), X0 )]\n\u221e\n\u03b5\nLloc ([0, \u221e), X0 )). Then, the time translation semigroup\n\nTl : K\u03b5+ \u2192 K\u03b5+ ,\n\n\u2217\n\n(the weak star topology of\n\n(Tl u)(t) = u(t + l),\n\n(3.6)\n\nis well defined for l \u2265 0. The semigroup Tl acting on K\u03b5+ endowed by the above defined topology is\ncalled the trajectory dynamical system associated with equation (1.1).\nWe recall that a sequence {V n } \u2282 L\u221e (R+ ; X0\u03b5 ) converges to V in \u0398+ if, for every T \u2265 0,\nV \u2192 V weakly star in L\u221e ((T, T + 1); X0\u03b5 ) as n goes to \u221e. Similarly, we can endow L\u221e (R; X0\u03b5 ) with\n\u03b5 w\u2217\nthe weak star local topology \u0398 := [L\u221e\n. The obtained topological spaces are Hausdorff and\nloc (R, X0 )]\nFr\u00e9chet-Urysohn with a countable base of open sets (see [11, Chap. XII]).\nIn order to be able to speak about the attractor of the trajectory dynamical system (Tl , K\u03b5+ )\n(i.e., the trajectory attractor of equation (1.1)), we also need to define the class of bounded sets in a\nproper way. We note that, in contrast to [11], only the energy bounded solutions which can be obtained\nthrough the Galerkin limit are included in K\u03b5+ (and that difference is crucial for what follows). By\nthis reason, we need, in addition, to introduce (following [37]) the so-called M -functional on the space\nK\u03b5+ :\nn\no\nMu\u03b5 (t) := inf lim inf kU nk (t)kX0\u03b5 : U = \u0398+ \u2212 lim U nk , U (0) = [X0\u03b5 ]w \u2212 lim U nk (0) ,\n(3.7)\nn\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nwhere the infimum is taken over all the sequences {U nk (t)}k\u2208N of Faedo-Galerkin approximations\nwhich \u0398+ -converge to the given solution U .\nRecalling now [37, Cor. 1.1], we can easily prove the following properties of the M \u2212energy\nfunctional, i.e., for any U \u2208 K\u03b5+ we have\nMu\u03b5 (t) < \u221e, kU (t)kX0\u03b5 \u2264 Mu\u03b5 (t), MT\u03b5l u (t) \u2264 Mu\u03b5 (t + l),\nZ \u221e\nMu\u03b5 (t)2 +\nkut (s)k2V \u2032 ds \u2264 CMu\u03b5 (\u03c4 )2 e\u2212\u03ba(t\u2212\u03c4 ) + C0 (1 + kgk2H ),\nt\n\n(3.8)\n\u2200t \u2265 \u03c4 \u2265 0.\n\n(3.9)\n\nWe can now say that a set B \u2282 K\u03b5+ is M \u2212bounded if\nsup Mu\u03b5 (0) < \u221e\n\n(3.10)\n\nU\u2208B\n\nand recall the definition of the trajectory attractor associated with (1.1).\n+\nDefinition 3.3. A set Atr\n\u03b5 \u2282 K\u03b5 is a trajectory attractor associated with energy solutions of equation\n(1.1) (i.e., the global attractor of the trajectory dynamical system (Tl , K\u03b5+ )) if:\n+\n+\nI) the set Atr\n\u03b5 is compact in K\u03b5 (endowed by the \u0398 topology);\ntr\ntr\nII) it is strictly invariant: Tl A\u03b5 = A\u03b5 , l \u2265 0;\ntr\nIII) for every M -bounded set B \u2282 K\u03b5+ and every neighborhood O(Atr\n\u03b5 ) of A\u03b5 (again in the\n+\ntopology of \u0398 ), there exists T = T (B, O) such that (attraction property)\n\nTl B \u2282 O(Atr\n\u03b5 ),\n\n\u2200l \u2265 T.\n\nWe can now state the existence of the trajectory attractor which can be proven arguing as in\n[37, Thm. 1.1].\n\n7\n\n\fTheorem 3.4. Let (2.6)-(2.8) and (2.10) hold. Then the semigroup Tl acting on K\u03b5+ possesses the\ntrajectory attractor Atr\n\u03b5 characterized as follows\nAtr\n\u03b5 = \u03a0+ K\u03b5 ,\n\n(3.11)\n\nwhere K\u03b5 \u2208 L\u221e (R; X0\u03b5 ) is the set of all the complete X0\u03b5 -bounded solutions to P\u03b5 which can be obtained\nas a Faedo-Galerkin limit, while \u03a0+ is the projection onto L\u221e (R+ ; X0\u03b5 ). More precisely, U \u2208 K\u03b5 if\nand only if there exist {tk } such that tk \u0581 \u2212\u221e and {U nk (t)} such that, for t \u2265 tk ,\n\u03b5unttk + unt k + A(Aunk + Pnk f (unk )) = g nk ,\n\n(3.12)\n\nunt k |t=tk\n\n(3.13)\n\nnk\n\nu |t=tk =\n\nuk0 ,\n\n=\n\nuk1 ,\n\nwith\nU nk (tk ) \u2208 (Pnk H)2 ,\n\nkU nk (tk )kX0\u03b5 \u2264 C,\n\nU = \u0398 \u2212 lim U nk ,\nk\u0580\u221e\n\n(3.14)\n\nwhere C > 0 is independent of k.\nThe proof of this theorem repeats word by word the proof of [37, Thm. 1.1] and, for this\nreason, is omitted. Still arguing as in [37], we can deduce the following corollaries. In the statements,\nif X, Y are Banach spaces, Cb (X; Y ) will denote the Banach space of all continuous and bounded\nfunctions from X to Y , endowed with the supremum norm.\nCorollary 3.5. Let B \u2282 K + an M-bounded set. Then, for every T \u2208 R+ and every \u03b2 \u2208 (0, 1], the\nfollowing convergence holds\nlim distL\u03b2 (l,T +l) (B|[l,T +l] , Atr |[l,T +l] ) = 0,\n\nl\u2192\u221e\n\nwhere\nL\u03b2 (l, T + l) = C([l, T + l], [D(A(1\u2212\u03b2)/2 ) \u2229 Lp+4\u2212\u03b2 (\u03a9)] \u00d7\n\n\u221a\n\u03b5D(A\u2212(1+\u03b2)/2 )).\n\n(3.15)\n\n(3.16)\n\nHere we recall the definition of the Hausdorff semidistance, namely\ndistL (B1 , B2 ) := sup inf dL (u, v),\nu\u2208B1 v\u2208B2\n\n(3.17)\n\nwhere L is some given metric space with distance dL and Bj \u2282 L, j = 1, 2.\nCorollary 3.6. Let U \u2208 K\u03b5 . Then, we have\nZ \u221e\nkut (s)k2V \u2032 ds \u2264 c(1 + kgk2H ),\n\u2212\u221e\n\nutt \u2208 Cb (R, D(A\u22122 )).\n\n(3.18)\n\nThus, for every \u03b2 > 0, there hold\nut \u2208 Cb (R, D(A\u2212(1+\u03b2)/2 )),\n\nlim kA\u2212(1+\u03b2)/2 ut (t)k2H = 0,\n\nt\u2192\u00b1\u221e\n\n(3.19)\n\nand we also have the convergence to the set of equilibria R\ndist(D(A(1\u2212\u03b2)/2 )\u2229Lp+4\u2212\u03b2 (\u03a9))\u00d7\u221a\u03b5D(A\u2212(1+\u03b2)/2 ) (U (t), R) \u2192 0,\n\n(3.20)\n\nas t goes to \u221e, for any \u03b2 \u2208 (0, 1].\nRemark 3.7. The choice of defining a trajectory dynamical system by selecting those solutions which\nare limits of Galerkin approximations excludes other possible solutions (u, ut ) \u2208 L\u221e (R+ , X0\u03b5 ) which\nsatisfy the equation (1.1) in the sense of distributions but cannot be obtained in that way. Actually,\nnothing is known about such \"pathological\" solutions and theoretically they may exist and even may\nnot be dissipative (that is, they may not satisfy the energy inequality). We remind that we cannot\nexclude that this might happen even in dimension two when f is allowed to have a supercubical\ngrowth. Thus, in order to be able to deal with attractors (no matter using the trajectory or multivalued semigroup approaches), one should restrict the admissible set of solutions. To do that, there\n8\n\n\fare at least two alternative ways. The first one is to consider only the solutions which satisfy some\nweakened form of energy inequality, like the 3D Navier-Stokes equations (see, e.g., [11] and references\ntherein). The second one (used in [37] and in this paper) is to consider only the solutions which can be\nobtained by the Galerkin approximations (see [30, Rem. 6.2] for more details). We only mention here\nthat both of them present some drawbacks. In particular, the class of energy solutions may depend\non some artificial constants in the energy inequality in the former approach, while it may depend on\nthe choice of a Galerkin basis in the latter one. Nonetheless, the second approach has an advantage\nwhich is crucial in the present case, namely, it allows to justify the further energy-like inequalities\nfor the energy solutions. In fact, it is completely unclear how to verify most of the results of this\npaper using the first method. One more drawback is that both the mentioned approaches destroy the\nconcatenation property of energy solutions and, up to the moment, no reasonable way to preserve this\nproperty and exclude the \"pathological\" non-dissipative solutions is known. Thus, the concatenation\nproperty seems to be an extremely restrictive assumption which can be verified only in relatively simple\ncases (usually, when the non-uniqueness is simply due to the presence of non-Lipschitz nonlinearities).\nFor this reason, in the multi-valued approach, one usually needs (following [3], see also [32] and its\nreferences) to replace the semigroup identity by the semigroup inclusion and the constructed attractor\nwill be also only semi-invariant with respect to the semigroup itself. This is exactly the approach\napplied in [33] to analyze equation (1.1). However, even though the trajectory approach is formally\nequivalent, the trajectory attractor remains strictly invariant even without the concatenation property\n(see Definition 3.3) and that makes it more convenient for concrete applications.\n\n4\n\nBackward smoothness of complete trajectories\n\nIn this section, we prove that any U = (u, ut ) \u2208 K\u03b5 (see Theorem 3.4) is backward smooth, i.e.,\nU (t) \u2208 V3\u03b5 if t is small enough. This kind of result is similar to [37, Thm. 2.1]; however, here we follow\nan alternative strategy which makes use of stationary solutions. Actually, in [37], the globally defined\ntrajectory was compared with the corresponding trajectory of the limit evolution equation obtained\nby setting \u03b5 = 0. Here, instead, we first find a solution v to an auxiliary equation and we prove that v\nis backward smooth. Then, we show that actually v(t) \u2261 u(t) for all t \u2264 T , when T is small enough.\nA crucial point of the argument is the construction of a smooth solution which will then be viewed as\nthe nonvanishing part of v. This is the content of the following\nTheorem 4.1. Let U = (u, ut ) \u2208 K\u03b5 . Then, for every \u03c3 > 0, there exist T = T (\u03c3, u) < 0 and a\nfunction \u0169 = \u0169\u03c3 \u2208 C \u221e (R\u2212 ; H 4 ) such that:\n1) for every \u03b2 > 0, there exists c > 0 independent of \u03c3 such that, for every t \u2264 T ,\net (t)kH \u2212\u03b2 \u2264 c\u03c3;\nku(t) \u2212 u\ne(t)kH 1\u2212\u03b2 + kut (t) \u2212 u\n\n(4.1)\n\nk\u0169kC 2 (R\u2212 ;H 4 ) \u2264 C(1 + kgkH );\n\n(4.2)\n\n2) there exists C > 0, which is independent of \u03c3 and t, such that\n\n3) for each m \u2208 N, m \u2265 1, there exist Cm > 0 and \u03ba > 0, which are independent of \u03c3 and t, such that\nk\u2202tm \u0169(t)kH 4 \u2264 Cm \u03c3 \u03ba ,\n\n\u2200 t \u2264 T.\n\n(4.3)\n\n4) \u0169 solves\n\u03b5\u0169tt + \u0169t + A2 \u0169 + Af (\u0169) = g + \u03c6(t),\n\n(4.4)\n\nwhere \u03c6 is a suitable function such that\nk\u03c6(t)kH + k\u03c6t (t)kH \u2264 C\u03c3 \u03ba ,\n\n\u2200 t \u2264 T.\n\n(4.5)\n\nProof.\nUsing (3.19) and (3.20), we see that, for every \u03c3 > 0 and every S \u2208 N, there exists\nT = T (\u03c3, u, S) < 0 such that, for every s \u2264 T , there is an equilibrium us which satisfies, for some\n\u03b2 \u2208 (0, 1],\nsup ku(t) \u2212 us kH 1\u2212\u03b2 \u2264 \u03c3.\n(4.6)\nt\u2208[s,s+S]\n\n9\n\n\fIn fact, fixing say S = 2 is sufficient for the proof.\nLet us check now that\nkus+S/2 \u2212 us kH 4 \u2264 C\u03c3 \u03ba\n\n(4.7)\n\nfor some positive C and \u03ba independent of \u03c3 and s. Indeed, since us and us+S/2 are equilibria and\ng \u2208 H, from the elliptic regularity we have that us , us+S/2 \u2208 H 4 . On the other hand, we have\nA2 (us \u2212 us+S/2 ) = \u2212A(f (us ) \u2212 f (us+S/2 )).\nThus, recalling that f \u2208 C 3 (R; R), we recover\nkus \u2212 us+S/2 kH 5 \u2264 C.\n\n(4.8)\n\nOn the other hand, by definition of us and us+S/2 , we have, for \u03b2 \u2208 (0, 1],\nku(s + S/2) \u2212 us kH 1\u2212\u03b2 + ku(s + S/2) \u2212 us+S/2 kH 1\u2212\u03b2 \u2264 2\u03c3.\n\n(4.9)\n\nkus \u2212 us+S/2 kH 1\u2212\u03b2 \u2264 2\u03c3,\n\n(4.10)\n\nThis yields\nwhich, together with (4.8) and interpolation, entails (4.7).\nWe are now ready to construct the desired function \u0169(t). Fix S = 2 and introduce a cut-off\nfunction \u03b8 \u2208 C0\u221e (R) such that \u03b8(t) \u2261 0 for t \u2264 0, \u03b8(t) \u2261 1, for t \u2265 1, 0 \u2264 \u03b8(t) \u2264 1. Then, for any\n\u03c3 > 0 and any N \u2208 N, define a function \u0169(t) on the interval t \u2208 [T \u2212 N, T \u2212 N + 1], T = T (\u03c3), by the\nfollowing formula\n\u0169(t) := \u03b8(t \u2212 T + N )uT \u2212N +1 + (1 \u2212 \u03b8(t \u2212 T + N ))uT \u2212N .\n(4.11)\nThis function is clearly smooth with respect to t and fulfills (4.2) and (4.3) (cf. (4.7)). Moreover,\nsince both equilibria uT \u2212N +1 and uT \u2212N are close to u(t) on the interval t \u2208 [T \u2212 N, T \u2212 N + 1] (see\n(4.6)), we also have, for all t \u2264 T ,\nku(t) \u2212 \u0169(t)kH 1\u2212\u03b2 \u2264 2\u03c3.\n(4.12)\nThus, on account of (3.19) and (4.10), we infer that (4.1) holds.\nTo conclude the proof, it remains to show (4.4) and (4.5). By (4.3), this is equivalent to check\nthat the function\n\u03c6\u0303 := A2 \u0169(t) + Af (\u0169) \u2212 g\n(4.13)\nis uniformly small. To this end, observe that\n\u03c6\u0303(t) = A2 uT \u2212N + \u03b8(t \u2212 T + N )A2 [uT \u2212N +1 \u2212 uT \u2212N ]\n\n(4.14)\n\n+ Af (uT \u2212N + \u03b8(t \u2212 T + N )[uT \u2212N +1 \u2212 uT \u2212N ]) \u2212 g\n\n= \u03b8(t \u2212 T + N )A2 [uT \u2212N +1 \u2212 uT \u2212N ]\n+ A[f (uT \u2212N + \u03b8(t \u2212 T + N )[uT \u2212N +1 \u2212 uT \u2212N ]) \u2212 f (uT \u2212N )]\nand, using (4.7) and the C 3 -regularity of f , it is not difficult to conclude that\nk\u03c6\u0303(t)kH + k\u03c6\u0303t (t)kH \u2264 C\u03c3 \u03ba .\n\n(4.15)\n\nThis inequality and (4.3) imply (4.4) and (4.5).\nNow, for L > 0 large enough (to be chosen below), we look for a solution v to the equation\n\u03b5vtt + vt + A2 v + Af (v) + LA\u22121 v = h(t),\n\n(4.16)\n\nh(t) = g + LA\u22121 u(t).\n\n(4.17)\n\nwhere\nWe recall that U = (u, ut ) \u2208 K\u03b5 is given.\n\n10\n\n\fObserve that (cf.

Let U = (u, ut ) \u2208 K\u03b5 be given. Then, for a sufficiently large L > 0, there exists\na time T = T (u, \u03b5, L) < 0 such that equation (4.16) possesses a unique strong backward solution\nV \u2208 L\u221e (\u2212\u221e, T ; V3\u03b5 ) satisfying\n\u221a\n\u03b5kvtt (t)kH + kvt (t)kH 2 + kv(t)kH 4 \u2264 QL (kgkH ),\n\u2200 t \u2264 T,\n(4.18)\nwhere the positive monotone function QL (*) is independent of \u03b5. Moreover, we have\nlim kvt (t)kL\u221e (\u03a9) = 0.\n\n(4.19)\n\nt\u2192\u2212\u221e\n\nProof.\nWe proceed as in [37, proof of Lemma 2.1] with some modifications introduced by Theorem\n4.1. We let \u03c3 > 0 (possibly small enough) and look for a v of the form\nv(t) = \u0169(t) + w(t),\n\n(4.20)\n\nwhere we recall that \u0169 depends on \u03c3.\nConsequently, w must solve the equation\n\u03b5wtt + wt + A2 w + A(f (\u0169 + w) \u2212 f (\u0169)) + LA\u22121 w = h\u0303(t),\n\n(4.21)\n\nh\u0303(t) = LA\u22121 (u \u2212 \u0169)(t) \u2212 \u03c6(t).\n\n(4.22)\n\nwhere\nWe will solve equation (4.21) by means of the inverse function Theorem (cf., e.g., [1, Thm. 2.1.2]).\n1\n((\u2212\u221e, T ]; H)\nThus, we take T < 0 small enough and consider the Banach space \u03a8b := Hloc\nwhich is endowed with the uniformly local norm\nkGkHb1 ((\u2212\u221e,T ];H) :=\n\nsup\nt\u2208(\u2212\u221e,T \u22121]\n\nkGkH 1 ((t,t+1);H) .\n\n(4.23)\n\nThen, it is easy to check that \u03a8b is continuously embedded into Cb ((\u2212\u221e, T ]; H). We also define\n\b\n\u03a6b := w \u2208 Cb2 ((\u2212\u221e, T ]; H) \u2229 Cb1 ((\u2212\u221e, T ]; H 2 ) \u2229 Cb ((\u2212\u221e, T ]; H 4 ) : \u03b5wtt + A2 w \u2208 \u03a8b . (4.24)\n\nAlso the space \u03a6b will be endowed with the natural (graph) norm. Thus, we can define the operator\nT : \u03a6b \u2192 \u03a8b given by\nTL : w 7\u2192 \u03b5wtt + wt + A2 w + A(f (\u0169 + w) \u2212 f (\u0169)) + LA\u22121 w.\nThen, we observe that, recalling (4.1) and (4.5), there exists T = T (\u03c3, u) \u2208 R such that\nkh\u0303kH 1 ((t,t+1);H) \u2264 CL (\u03c3 + \u03c3 \u03ba ),\n\n\u2200 t \u2264 T.\n\n(4.25)\n\nThus we work in a neighborhood of 0 and we consider the linear operator TL\u2032 (0) from \u03a6b to \u03a8b given\nby\nTL\u2032 (0)W = \u03b5Wtt + Wt + A2 W + A(f \u2032 (\u0169)W ) + LA\u22121 W.\nIt then suffices to show that TL\u2032 (0) is invertible. Thus we consider the variation equation at w = 0,\nnamely,\n\u03b5Wtt + Wt + A2 W + A(f \u2032 (\u0169)W ) + LA\u22121 W = G(t).\n(4.26)\n11\n\n\fHere, we will assume that G is a given function of \u03a8b . We will now prove that (4.26) has a unique\nsolution W \u2208 \u03a6b , that is, TL\u2032 (0)W = G, for T small enough and L large enough.\nLet us proceed formally by multiplying equation (4.26) by A\u22121 (Wt + \u03b1W ), \u03b1 > 0.

Let us first analyze the two-dimensional case in the case of cubic controlled growth.\nNamely, we take f \u2208 C 3 (R; R) with f (0) = 0 satisfying (2.6), (2.7) and\nf \u2032\u2032\u2032 \u2208 L\u221e (R; R).\n\n(5.1)\n\nWe know that, for any \u03b5 > 0, problem P\u03b5 generates a (strongly continuous) semigroup S\u03b5 (t) on V2\u03b5\n(see [26, Thm. 2.2], cf. also [26, Rem. 2.1]), i.e., the trajectories are quasi-strong solutions. Moreover,\nthe dynamical system (V2\u03b5 , S\u03b5 (t)) possesses a global attractor A\u03b5 which is bounded in V3\u03b5 (cf. [26,\nThm. 4.1]). On the other hand, in the case of energy solutions, we also know that P\u03b5 generates a\n(strongly continuous) semigroup S\u0303\u03b5 (t) on V0\u03b5 which has the global attractor A\u03b5 (see [26, Sec. 6]). Thus,\non account of Theorem 3.4, we have that K coincides with the set of all the complete energy bounded\nsolutions and\nA\u03b5 \u2261 \u03a00 Atr\n(5.2)\n\u03b5 ,\nwhere \u03a00 U (t) = U (0).\nIt is clear that A\u03b5 \u2282 A\u03b5 , while the validity of the opposite inclusion was an open question so\nfar.

Then\nA\u03b5 \u2261 A\u03b5 .\n\n(5.3)\n\nProof.\nLet us consider first the set K\u03b5 of all the complete bounded strong solutions so that\nA\u03b5 \u2261 \u03a00 K\u03b5 . It is clear that K\u03b5 \u2282 K\u03b5 . Let us consider now a bounded complete energy solution U\nto (2.11). Then, by Theorem 4.3, there exists a time T = Tu such that U (t) \u2208 V3\u03b5 for all t \u2264 T and\nsatisfies a bound like (4.56). On the other hand, we know that there exists a unique strong solution \u0168\nto (2.11) bounded on [T, +\u221e) and such that \u0168 (T ) = U (T ). Thus we can construct a complete strong\nsolution\n(\n\u0168 (t),\nt > T,\n\u2217\nU (t) =\n(5.4)\nU (t),\nt \u2264 T,\n\nwhich is bounded on R in the V3\u03b5 -norm. Thus, Theorem 4.4 implies that U \u2261 U \u2217 . Therefore, we have\nthat K\u03b5 \u2282 K\u03b5 and the proof is complete.\n17\n\n\fIn the three-dimensional case or in two dimensions with supercubical growth, we cannot say\nmore than Theorem 3.4 about the existence of global solutions without making a restriction on \u03b5.\nMore precisely, we have the following result (see [25, Thm. 2.4])\nTheorem 5.2. Let (2.6)-(2.8) and (2.10) hold. Then, there exist \u03b50 > 0 and a nonincreasing positive\nfunction R : (0, \u03b50 ) \u2192 (0, +\u221e) with the property\nlim R(\u03b5) = +\u221e,\n\n(5.5)\n\n\u03b5\u05810\n\nsuch that, for every \u03b5 \u2208 (0, \u03b50 ) and every initial condition U0 = (u0 , u1 ) \u2208 V1 satisfying\nkU0 kV1\u03b5 \u2264 R(\u03b5),\n\n(5.6)\n\nthere exists a (unique) global weak solution U = (u, ut ) to problem P\u03b5 such that\nkU (t)kV1\u03b5 \u2264 Q(kU0 kV1\u03b5 )e\u2212\u03bat + Q(kgkH ),\n\n\u2200 t \u2265 0,\n\n(5.7)\n\nfor some \u03ba > 0 and some positive increasing monotone function Q both independent of \u03b5.\nFollowing [37], we consider the V1\u03b5 -ball B(R(\u03b5)) of radius R(\u03b5) centered at 0 and define the\nsolving operator\nS\u03b5 (t) : B(R(\u03b5)) \u2192 V1\u03b5 ,\nU (t) = S\u03b5 (t)U (0), \u2200 t \u2265 0.\nThanks to estimate (5.7), we have\nkS\u03b5 (t)(B(R(\u03b5)))kV1\u03b5 \u2264 \u039b,\n\n\u2200 t \u2265 0,\n\nfor an appropriate positive quantity \u039b (clearly also depending on kgkH ). Then, we set\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n[\nB\u03b5 := \uf8f0 S\u03b5 (t)(B(R(\u03b5)))\uf8fb ,\nt\u22650\n\n(5.8)\n\nV1\u03b5\n\nwhere [*]V1\u03b5 denotes the closure in V1\u03b5 , and we note that B\u03b5 is bounded in V1\u03b5 by \u039b. Moreover, B\u03b5\nis closed and positively invariant by construction. Thus, we can say that (B\u03b5 , S\u03b5 (t)) is a dissipative\ndynamical system.\nOn the other hand, we know that (see [25, Thm. 2.7]), up to possibly taking a smaller \u03b50 and\ncorrespondingly modifying the function R, for all \u03b5 \u2208 (0, \u03b50 ) (B\u03b5 , S\u03b5 (t)) possesses a global attractor\nA\u03b5 bounded in V3\u03b5 . Consider now the set K\u03b5 of all complete and bounded weak solutions taking values\nin the phase space B\u03b5 . Thanks to the above considerations, we have that A\u03b5 = \u03a0t K\u03b5 , for any t \u2208 R.\nHence, each U \u2208 K\u03b5 is indeed a global strong solution. We can now prove\nTheorem 5.3. Let the assumptions of Theorem 5.2 hold. Then there exists \u03b51 \u2208 (0, \u03b50 ] such that, if\n\u03b5 \u2208 (0, \u03b51 ), then\nK\u03b5 \u2261 K\u03b5 ,\n(5.9)\nwhere K\u03b5 is defined in Theorem 3.4. In particular, we have\nA\u03b5 \u2261 \u03a00 Atr\n\u03b5 .\n\n(5.10)\n\nProof.\nIt is clear that K\u03b5 \u2282 K\u03b5 . On the other hand, if we consider a bounded complete energy\nsolution U given by Theorem 3.4 (i.e., an element of the trajectory attractor), then Theorem 4.3\nimplies the existence of a time T = Tu such that U (t) \u2208 V3\u03b5 for all t \u2264 T and satisfies a bound like\n(4.56). In particular, this bound entails that, for all t \u2264 Tu ,\nkU (t)kV1\u03b5 = ku(t)k2H 2 + \u03b5kut (t)k2H\n\n\u00011/2\n\n\u2264 Q1 (kgkH ),\n\n(5.11)\n\nwhere Q1 (*) is a computable function whose expression is independent of \u03b5. At this point, we restrict\nourselves to those \u03b5 \u2208 (0, \u03b50 ) such that\nQ1 (kgkH ) \u2264 R(\u03b5).\n18\n\n(5.12)\n\n\fBy (5.5) and the (decreasing) monotonicity of R(*), this will hold for all \u03b5 in some interval (0, \u03b51 ),\nwhere \u03b51 \u2264 \u03b50 . By Theorem 5.2, we know that there exists a unique solution \u0168 \u2208 Cb ([T, +\u221e); V1\u03b5 ) to\n(2.11) such that \u0168 (T ) = U (T ). Thus, recalling (5.4), we can construct once more a complete weak\nsolution U \u2217 . Moreover, being B(R(\u03b5)) \u2282 B\u03b5 by (5.8), this solution is such that\nU \u2217 (t) \u2208 B\u03b5\n\n\u2200 t \u2208 R.\n\nThus we have that necessarily U \u2217 \u2208 K\u03b5 . On the other hand, Theorem 4.4 implies that U \u2261 U \u2217 .\nTherefore, we have once again K\u03b5 \u2282 K\u03b5 .\n\n6\n\nExponential regularization of energy solutions\n\nIn this section, we use the proved regularity of the trajectory attractor Atr\n\u03b5 in order to verify that every\nenergy solution is a sum of an exponentially decaying and a smooth function. This fact, together with\nthe transitivity of exponential attraction, will allow us to establish that the exponential attractor M\u03b5 ,\nconstructed in [25] for the case of weak solutions (and small \u03b5 > 0) is automatically the exponential\nattractor in the class of energy solutions as well. Moreover, that exponential regularization property\nwill help us to verify the well-posedness and dissipativity of the 2D problem (1.1) in the intermediate\n(between V0 and V2 ) phase space V1 . To this end, we first formulate the regularity estimate for the\nsolutions on the attractor Atr\n\u03b5 obtained before.\nCorollary 6.1. Let the assumptions of Theorem 5.1 or Theorem 5.3 be satisfied. Then any complete\ntrajectory U \u2208 K\u03b5 satisfies\nku(t)k2H 4 + kut (t)k2H 2 + \u03b5kutt (t)k2H \u2264 C,\n\n(6.1)\n\nwhere the constant C is independent of t, \u03b5 and of the concrete choice of the trajectory u.\nThe next result, which gives the analogue of Theorem 4.1 for the forward in time energy\nsolutions, is the main technical tool of this section.\nLemma 6.2. Let the assumptions of Corollary 6.1 hold, so that the trajectory attractor Atr\n\u03b5 of equation\n(1.1) possesses the regularity (6.1). In addition, suppose that f \u2208 C 4 (R; R). Then, for every energy\nsolution U \u2208 K\u03b5+ and every \u03c3 > 0, there exist T = T (\u03b5, \u03ba, Mu\u03b5 (0)) and a function \u0169(t) such that\nk\u0169(t)k2H 4 + k\u0169t (t)k2H 2 + \u03b5k\u0169tt (t)k2H \u2264 C \u2032 , t \u2265 T,\n\n(6.2)\n\nwhere the constant C \u2032 depends only on the constant C in (6.1). Moreover, this function solves the\nequation\n\u03b5\u0169tt + \u0169t + A(A\u0169 + f (\u0169)) = g + \u03c6(t),\n(6.3)\nwith\nk\u03c6kCb ([T,+\u221e),H) \u2264 C\u03c3 \u03ba ,\n\n(6.4)\n\nwhere C and \u03ba > 0 are independent of \u03c3 and such that\nku(t) \u2212 \u0169(t)kH + kut (t) \u2212 \u0169t (t)kH \u22122 \u2264 \u03c3,\n\n(6.5)\n\nfor all t \u2265 T .\nProof.\nThe proof of this lemma is very similar to the proof of Theorem 4.1. However, instead of\nthe backward attraction to the smooth set of equilibria, we need to use the forward attraction to the\nsmooth trajectory attractor Atr\n\u03b5 . Indeed, since the trajectory (u, ut ) is attracted by the trajectory\nattractor Atr\n,\nthen,\nanalogously\nto (3.15), we have that, for every \u03c3 > 0, there exist T = T (\u03b5, \u03c3, Mu (0))\n\u03b5\nand a trajectory (us , \u2202t us ) \u2208 K\u03b5 , s \u2265 1 such that\nku(t) \u2212 us (t)kH + k\u2202t u(t) \u2212 \u2202t us (t)kH \u22122 \u2264 \u03c3, t \u2208 [T + s \u2212 1, T + s + 2]\n\n19\n\n(6.6)\n\n\ffor every s \u2265 1 (compare with (4.6)). Moreover, analogously to Theorem 4.1, due to the regularity\n(6.1) of the attractor and estimate (6.6), we conclude that\nk\u2202t us (t) \u2212 \u2202t us+1 (t)kH 1 + kus (t) \u2212 us+1 (t)kH 3 \u2264 C\u03c3 \u03ba , t \u2208 [T + s, T + s + 1],\n\n(6.7)\n\nwhere the positive constants C and \u03ba are independent of \u03b5, s and the choice of the trajectory u.\nFinally, defining the function \u0169(t) on the interval [T + N, T + N + 1] as follows\n\u0169(t) := \u03b8(t \u2212 T \u2212 N )uN +1 (t) + (1 \u2212 \u03b8(t \u2212 T \u2212 N ))uN (t),\nwhere the cut-off function \u03b8 is the same as in Theorem 4.1 and setting\n\u03c6(t) := \u03b5\u0169tt (t) + \u0169t (t) + A(A\u0169(t) + f (\u0169(t))) \u2212 g,\none can see that the function \u03c6(t) satisfies estimate (6.4). Indeed, since uN and uN +1 solve the initial\nproblem (2.11), we have\n\u03c6(t) = 2\u03b5\u03b8\u2032 \u2202t (uN +1 \u2212 uN ) + (\u03b5\u03b8\u2032\u2032 + \u03b8\u2032 )(uN +1 \u2212 uN )\n+ A[f (\u03b8uN +1 + (1 \u2212 \u03b8)uN ) \u2212 \u03b8f (uN +1 ) \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b8)f (uN )],\n\n(6.8)\n\nwhere \u03b8 = \u03b8(t \u2212 T \u2212 N ). We see that the first two terms are immediately under the control thanks to\n(6.7) and, in order to estimate the third term, we transform it as follows:\nf (\u03b8uN +1 + (1 \u2212 \u03b8)uN ) \u2212 \u03b8f (uN +1 ) \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b8)f (uN )\nZ 1\n= \u03b8(1 \u2212 \u03b8)(uN +1 \u2212 uN )\n[f \u2032 (s\u0169 + (1 \u2212 s)uN ) \u2212 f \u2032 (s\u0169 + (1 \u2212 s)uN +1 )] ds.\n0\n\nThus, due to (6.7) and the fact that f \u2208 C 4 (R; R), the third term in (6.8) is also under control and\nestimate (6.4) holds. That finishes the proof of the lemma.\nThe next theorem is analogous to Theorem 4.2, but a bit more delicate since the regularity\n(6.4) of the function \u03c6 given in Lemma 6.2 is slightly lower than in Theorem 4.1.\nTheorem 6.3. Let the assumptions of Lemma 6.2 hold. Then, for any L > 0 and any trajectory\nU \u2208 K\u03b5+ , there exists a time T = T (\u03b5, L, Mu(0)) such that the equation\n\u03b5vtt + vt + A(Av + f (v)) + LA\u22121 v = G(t) := g + LA\u22121 u(t)\n\n(6.9)\n\nhas a regular global solution v(t), t \u2265 T satisfying\n\u03b5kvtt (t)k2H + kvt (t)k2H 2 + kv(t)k2H 4 \u2264 CL ,\n\n(6.10)\n\nwhere the constant CL depends on L, but is independent of \u03b5, t and u. Moreover,\nkvt (t)k2L\u221e (\u03a9) + kv(t)k2L\u221e (\u03a9) \u2264 C,\n\n(6.11)\n\nwhere C is independent of L and \u03b5.\nProof.\nStep 1. As in Theorem 4.2, in order to solve equation (6.9) we introduce the function\nw(t) := v(t) \u2212 \u0169(t), where \u0169(t) is constructed in Lemma 6.2. Then, this function satisfies\n\u03b5wtt + wt + A(Aw + [f (\u0169(t) + w) \u2212 f (\u0169(t))]) + LA\u22121 w = G\u0303(t) := LA\u22121 (u(t) \u2212 \u0169(t)) \u2212 \u03c6(t). (6.12)\nMoreover, due to Lemma 6.2, for any L and any 0 < \u03c3 < 1/L2 , we may find T = T (\u03b5, L, \u03c3, Mu (0))\nsuch that\nkG\u0303kCb ([T,+\u221e),H) \u2264 C\u03c3 \u03ba ,\n(6.13)\nwhere the positive constants C and \u03ba are independent of L, t and u. Then, for small \u03c3, equation\n(6.12) endowed by the initial data\nw(T ) = 0, wt (T ) = LA\u22121 (u(T ) \u2212 \u0169(T )),\n20\n\n(6.14)\n\n\fcan be uniquely solved using the inverse function theorem (analogously to Theorem 4.2). However,\nsince we now do not have the control of the time derivative of \u03c6, we are unable to construct the\nV3\u03b5 -solutions in such way and should restrict ourselves to consider the V1\u03b5 -solutions only. Namely, it\nis not difficult to show using the inverse function theorem that, for sufficiently small \u03c3, there exists a\nunique global solution w(t) of problem (6.12) with the above initial data such that\n\u03b5kwt (t)k2H + kw(t)k2H 2 \u2264 C \u2032 \u03c3 2\u03ba , t \u2265 T,\n\n(6.15)\n\nwhere the constant C \u2032 is independent of L, t and \u03c3 (since very similar arguments have been considered\nin detail in the proof of Theorem 4.2, we omit the details here).\nIn addition, from equation (6.12), we see that\n\u03b5A\u22121 wtt + A\u22121 wt = hw (t) := \u2212Aw(t) \u2212 [f (\u0169(t) + w(t)) \u2212 f (\u0169(t))] + A\u22121 G\u0303(t).\n\n(6.16)\n\nThus, due to estimates (6.13) and (6.15), we have\nkhw (t)kH \u2264 C\u03c3 \u03ba ,\n\nt \u2265 T.\n\nSolving explicitly (6.16) as an ODE with respect to wt and using the last estimate together with (6.5)\nand (6.14), we arrive at\nkwt (t)kH \u22122 \u2264 C\u03c3 \u03ba , t \u2265 T,\n(6.17)\nwhere the positive constants C and \u03ba are independent of L, \u03b5, t and u.\nStep 2. As we have already mentioned, the regularity (6.15) and (6.17) for the auxiliary\nproblem (6.9) is not sufficient for our purposes and we need to improve it. To this end, we remind that,\nby the construction of \u0169, we may assume without loss of generality that \u03c6(T ) = 0 and, consequently,\ninitial conditions (6.14) imply that wtt (T ) = 0. Therefore,\nv(T ) = \u0169(T ),\n\nvt (T ) = \u0169t (T ) + LA\u22121 (u(T ) \u2212 \u0169(T )),\n\nvtt (T ) = \u0169tt (T ).\n\n(6.18)\n\nThus, the initial data for the solution v at t = T is more regular, namely (cf. (6.2) and (6.5)),\nkv(T )k2H 4 + kvt (T )k2H 2 + \u03b5kvtt (T )k2H \u2264 C,\n\n(6.19)\n\nwhere the constant C is independent of \u03b5 and L (recall that \u03c3 \u2208 (0, 1/L2)). Since the (global in time\nand independent of \u03b5) control of the H 2 -norm of the solution v(t) is already obtained (see estimates\n(6.2) and (6.15)), then f (v(t)) is under control. Thus the regularity (6.19) of the initial data implies\nin a standard way (see e.g., [25] and the proof of Theorem 4.2), that the solution v(t) is indeed\nmore regular and, in particular, estimate (6.10) holds with the constant CL depending on L, but\nindependent of \u03b5 and t.\nStep 3. We only need to obtain the estimate (6.11) for the L\u221e -norms of v and vt with the\nconstant C independent of L. Moreover, the desired estimate for v is already available (see (6.15)\nand (6.2)), so we only need to estimate the L\u221e -norm of the time derivative. To this end, we use the\nfollowing standard interpolation inequality together with (6.2) and (6.17)\nkvt (t)kL\u221e \u2264 k\u0169t (t)kL\u221e + kwt (t)kL\u221e\n\u2264C+\n\n7/8\n1/8\nkwt (t)kH \u22122 kwt (t)kH 2\n\n\u2264 C + C\u03c3\n\n(6.20)\n\u03ba/8\n\n(1 + kvt (t)kH 2 + k\u0169t (t)kH 2 ) \u2264 C + CL \u03c3\n\n\u03ba/8\n\n,\n\nwhere only the constant CL may depend on L and all of the constants are independent of \u03b5 and \u03c3. It\nonly remains to note that, for every fixed L, we may fix \u03c3 = \u03c3(L) in a such way that CL \u03c3 \u03ba/8 \u2264 1.\nEstimate (6.11) is then an immediate corollary of (6.20) and the theorem is proved.\nWe are now ready to state and prove the main result of this section.\nTheorem 6.4. Let the assumptions of Lemma 6.2 hold, so that the trajectory attractor Atr\n\u03b5 of equation\n(1.1) satisfies the regularity estimate (6.1) with the constant C independent of \u03b5 \u2192 0. Then, there\nexist a R0 -ball\n(6.21)\nB := {(a, b) \u2208 H 4 \u00d7 H 2 , kak2H 4 + kbk2H 2 \u2264 R02 },\n21\n\n\fwhere the radius R0 is independent of \u03b5 \u2192 0, and a monotone function Q\u03b5 (depending on \u03b5) such\nthat, for every weak energy solution U (t) = (u(t), ut (t)) \u2208 K\u03b5+ , the following estimate holds:\ndistX0\u03b5 (U (t), B) \u2264 Q\u03b5 (Mu\u03b5 (0))e\u2212\u03b2t ,\n\n(6.22)\n\nwhere the positive exponent \u03b2 is independent of t and \u03b5 \u2192 0.\nProof.\nLet U \u2208 K\u03b5+ be arbitrary. Then, due to Theorem 6.3, for every L > 0, there exists\nT = T (\u03b5, L, Mu\u03b5 (0)) (which is independent of the concrete choice of the trajectory U ) such that the\nauxiliary equation (6.9) is globally solvable for t \u2265 T in the class of regular solutions and the solution\nv(t) satisfies estimates (6.10) and (6.11). Moreover, crucial for our method is the fact that the constant\nC in (6.11) is independent of L, \u03b5, T and U . Let now w(t) := u(t) \u2212 v(t). Then, this function solves\n\u03b5wtt + wt \u2212 A(Aw + [f (v + w) \u2212 f (v)]) + LA\u22121 w = 0.\n\n(6.23)\n\nRecall that we deal only with energy solutions which can be obtained by Galerkin approximations.\nSo, we now need to derive the proper estimate for the function w using the Galerkin approximations exactly as in Theorem 4.3. However, in order to avoid the technicalities, we will proceed by\nformal multiplication of the equation (6.23) by A\u22121 (wt + \u03b1w) (see the proof of Theorem 4.3 for the\njustification). Then, after integration in space, we arrive at\nd\nEw + \u03b1Ew = Hw ,\ndt\n\nin [T, +\u221e),\n\n(6.24)\n\nwhere\nEw = \u03b5kA\u22121/2 wt k2H + kA1/2 wk2H + LkA\u22121 wk2H + 2\u03b1\u03b5(w, wt )\n\n(6.25)\n\nHw := \u2212(2 \u2212 3\u03b5)kA\u22121/2 wt k2H \u2212 \u03b1kA1/2 wk2H \u2212 \u03b1LkA\u22121 wk2H\n+ 2\u03b1 (F (v + w) \u2212 F (v) \u2212 f (v)w \u2212 (f (v + w) \u2212 f (v))w, 1)\n\n(6.26)\n\n\u22121/2\n\n+ \u03b1kA\n\nwk2H\n\n+ 2 (F (v + w) \u2212 F (v) \u2212 f (v)w, 1)\n\nand\n\n+ 2\u03b12 \u03b5(w, wt ) + \u03b12 kwk2H\n\n+ 2 (f (v + w) \u2212 f (v) \u2212 f \u2032 (v)w, vt ) .\n\nSince the constant in estimate (6.11) for the L\u221e -norm of v and vt is independent of L, arguing as in\nestimates (4.70), we may fix L in such way that (recall also [37, (2.51)])\nC \u2265 Ew \u2265 \u03b3k(w, wt )k2X0\u03b5 ,\n\nHw \u2264 0,\n\n(6.27)\n\nwhere the positive constants C and \u03b3 are independent of the concrete choice of the trajectory U .\nThe Gronwall inequality applied to (6.24) now gives\nk(w(t), wt (t))k2X0\u03b5 \u2264 C([Mu\u03b5 (T )]2 + 1)e\u2212\u03b1(t\u2212T ) , t \u2265 T.\nIt only remains to recall that T = T (\u03b5, Mu\u03b5 (0)) (and L is now fixed) and use (3.9) in order to estimate\nMu\u03b5 (T ) through Mu\u03b5 (0). That yields\nk(w(t), wt (t))k2X0\u03b5 \u2264 Q\u03b5 (Mu\u03b5 (0))e\u2212\u03b1t ,\nwhich implies (6.22) and finishes the proof of the theorem.\nRemark 6.5. Although all estimates of auxiliary solutions in the proof given above are uniform\nwith respect to \u03b5 \u2192 0, the monotone function Q\u03b5 in the main estimate (6.22) depends on \u03b5 since our\nconstruction depends crucially on the attraction property to the trajectory attractor Atr\n\u03b5 in a weaker\ntopology (see Corollary 3.5) and the rate of that convergence may be not uniform with respect to \u03b5.\n22\n\n\fIn a fact, it can be non-uniform even with respect to \u03b5 \u2208 [\u03b51 , \u03b52 ] with \u03b51 > 0. This problem may be\nsolved in a standard way if we consider the extended trajectory semigroup\n+\nK[\u03b5\n:= {(U, \u03b5), U \u2208 K\u03b5+ , \u03b5 \u2208 [\u03b51 , \u03b52 ]},\n1 ,\u03b52 ]\n\nTl (U, \u03b5) := (Tl U, \u03b5),\n\nconstruct its attractor and use the rate of convergence to the attractor for that semigroup. The\ndifference is that we are now able to approximate the trajectory U \u2208 K\u03b5+ not only by the elements of\ntr\nAtr\n\u03b5 but also by the elements of A\u03b5n with \u03b5n \u2192 \u03b5, which would be enough to obtain the uniformity\nwith respect to \u03b5 (see [4] for details). In order to avoid technicalities, we prefer not to give the proof\nof that uniformity here. However, there is one more essential drawback in the above scheme which\ncannot be corrected in such an easy way, namely, as we have already mentioned, the function Q\u03b5 in\nestimate (6.22) depends in a crucial way on the rate of attraction to the attractor and this rate of\nconvergence cannot be found explicitly or expressed in terms of the physical parameters of the system\nconsidered (the usual drawback of the global attractors theory), thus, we are factually unable to give\nany expression for the function Q\u03b5 following the above described arguments. For this reason, we give\nbelow an alternative explicit construction of the auxiliary \"almost solution\" \u0169(t) for the case when\n\u03b5 > 0 is very small. In addition, this construction has another advantage, namely, it is based only on\nthe perturbation arguments and does not use the global Lyapunov functional. This allows to apply\nit also to non-autonomous cases or to the case of unbounded domains where the Lyapunov functional\ndoes not exist. We will return to such issues in more details elsewhere.\nThe following lemma is the uniform (with respect to \u03b5 \u2192 0) analogue of the key Lemma 6.2.\nLemma 6.6. Let the assumptions of Lemma 6.2 hold. Then, for every \u03c3 > 0, there exists \u03b50 =\n\u03b50 (\u03c3) > 0 such that, for any energy solution U \u2208 K\u03b5+ with \u03b5 \u2264 \u03b50 , there exist T = T (\u03ba, Mu\u03b5 (0)) and a\nfunction \u0169(t) such that\nk\u0169(t)k2H 4 + k\u0169t (t)k2H 2 + \u03b5k\u0169tt (t)k2H \u2264 C,\n\nt \u2265 T,\n\n(6.28)\n\nwhere the constant C is independent of u and \u03b5 . Moreover, this function solves the equation\n\u03b5\u0169tt + \u0169t + A(A\u0169 + f (\u0169)) = g + \u03c6(t),\n\n(6.29)\n\nk\u03c6kCb ([T,+\u221e),H) \u2264 C\u03c3 \u03ba ,\n\n(6.30)\n\nwith\nwhere C and \u03ba > 0 are independent of \u03c3 and \u03b5 and such that\nku(t) \u2212 \u0169(t)kH + kut (t) \u2212 \u0169t (t)kH \u22122 \u2264 \u03c3,\n\n(6.31)\n\nfor all t \u2265 T . In addition, all of the constants can be expressed explicitly in terms of the physical\nparameters.\nProof.\n\nWe define the trajectory \u0169 as a solution of the modified Cahn-Hilliard equation\n\u0169t + A(A\u0169 + f (\u0169)) + L0 A\u22121 \u0169 = g + L0 A\u22121 u(t), \u0169(0) = u(0),\n\n(6.32)\n\nwhere u \u2208 K\u03b5+ and L0 = L0 (f ) is a sufficiently large number depending only on f . Then, on the one\nhand, the difference u(t) \u2212 \u0169(t) satisfies the following estimate:\n\u0001\nku(t) \u2212 \u0169(t)k2H \u22121 \u2264 C\u03b5 1 + Q (Mu\u03b5 (0)) e\u2212\u03b1t ,\n(6.33)\n\nwhere the positive constants C and \u03b1 and the monotone function Q are independent of u, \u03b5 and t\n(see [25, Prop. 3.4] for the details). Moreover, since we have the uniform control of the H 1 -norms of\nu and \u0169, this estimate together with the interpolation inequality gives\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(6.34)\nku(t) \u2212 \u0169(t)k2H \u2264 C\u03b51/2 1 + Q (Mu\u03b5 (0))2 e\u2212\u03b1t .\nOn the other hand, equation (6.32) is a classical parabolic Cahn-Hilliard equation whose\nsolutions possess the standard parabolic smoothing property. Their regularity is restricted only by\n23\n\n\fthe regularity of the nonlinearity f and the external forces g + L0 A\u22121 u(t). In our case, we have\nf \u2208 C 3 (R, R) and u \u2208 W 1,\u221e (R+ , H \u22121 (\u03a9)) \u2229 L\u221e (R+ , H 1 (\u03a9)). It is then not difficult to verify that\nthis regularity is enough to establish the following estimate for \u0169(t):\nk\u0169(t)kH 4 + k\u0169t (t)kH 2 +\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03b5k\u0169tt (t)kL2 \u2264 C\u2217 + Q(Mu\u03b5 (0))\n\n1 + tN \u2212\u03b1t\ne ,\ntN\n\n(6.35)\n\nwhere the positive constants C\u2217 , N and \u03b1 and the monotone function Q are independent of u, \u03b5 and\nt. Since the derivation of this estimate is standard (although a bit technical), we leave it to the reader\n(see, e.g., [15, Lemma 2.13] for a similar argument).\nThus, the function \u0169(t) solves equation (6.29) with\n\u03c6(t) := \u03b5\u0169tt (t) + L0 A\u22121 (u(t) \u2212 \u0169(t)),\nand therefore, thanks to (6.34) and (6.35),\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 + tN\nk\u03c6(t)kH \u2264 C\u03b51/4 1 + Q(Mu\u03b5 (0)) N e\u2212\u03b1t .\nt\n\n(6.36)\n\nFinally, we only need to estimate the difference v(t) := u(t) \u2212 \u0169(t) in the proper norm. To this end,\ntaking the difference between (2.11) and (6.29), we derive that\n\u03b5vtt + vt = H(t) := \u2212A2 v(t) \u2212 A[f (u(t)) \u2212 f (\u0169(t))] \u2212 \u03c6(t).\n\n(6.37)\n\nMoreover, using assumption (2.8) on the nonlinearity f and the fact that the Lp+4 -norms of u and \u0169\nare under control (due to the energy estimate), we conclude from estimate (6.34) that\n\u0001\nkf (u(t)) \u2212 f (\u0169(t))kL1 \u2264 (Q(Mu\u03b5 (0))e\u2212\u03b1t + C\u2217 )ku(t) \u2212 \u0169(t)k\u03baH \u2264 C\u03b5\u03ba/4 1 + Q(Mu\u03b5 (0))e\u2212\u03b1t\n\nfor some positive \u03ba depending only on p. Thus, thanks to (6.34) and (6.36) and the embedding\nH 2 (\u03a9) \u0592\u2192 C 0 (\u03a9\u0304),\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 + tN\nkA\u22122 H(t)kH \u2264 C\u03b5\u03ba/4 1 + Q(Mu\u03b5 (0)) N e\u2212\u03b1t .\nt\nSolving explicitly the ODE (6.37) on the interval [t/2, t] and using the last estimate together with the\nestimate (6.35), we conclude that\n\u0012\n\u0013\nt\n1 + tN \u2212\u03b1t\n\u03b5\n\u22122\n\u03ba/4\n\u03ba/4\n\u2212 2\u03b5\n) 1 + Q(Mu (0)) N e\n.\nkA vt (t)kH \u2264 C\u03b5\n+ C(\u03b5\n+e\nt\n\nFinally, keeping in mind that the H \u22121 -norm of vt is under control (due to the energy estimate), we\nend up with\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 + tN\nt\n(6.38)\nkut (t) \u2212 \u0169t (t)kH \u22122 \u2264 C\u03b5\u03ba/12 + C(\u03b5\u03ba/12 + e\u2212 6\u03b5 ) 1 + Q(Mu\u03b5 (0)) N e\u2212\u03b1t .\nt\nEstimates (6.34), (6.35), (6.36) and (6.38) show that, indeed, for every \u03ba > 0, we may fix \u03b50 = \u03b50 (\u03ba)\nand T = T (Mu\u03b5 (0)) such that all estimates stated in Lemma 6.6 will be satisfied uniformly with respect\nto \u03b5 \u2264 \u03b50 and U \u2208 K\u03b5+ . That finishes the proof of the lemma.\nCorollary 6.7. Let the assumptions of Lemma 6.2 hold. Then, there exist \u03b50 > 0 and R0 > 0 such\nthat, for every \u03b5 < \u03b50 , the set\nB\u03b5 := {(u0 , u\u20320 ) \u2208 H 4 \u00d7 H 2 : ku0 k2H 4 + ku\u20320 k2H 2 \u2264 R02 }\n\n(6.39)\n\nattracts exponentially all energy solutions U \u2208 K\u03b5+ :\ndistX0\u03b5 ((u(t), ut (t)), B\u03b5 ) \u2264 Q(Mu\u03b5 (0))e\u2212\u03b1t ,\n\n(6.40)\n\nwhere the positive constant \u03b1 and monotone function Q are independent of t, \u03b5 \u2264 \u03b50 and of the\n\u03b5\nconcrete choice of the trajectory U \u2208 K+\n.\n24\n\n\fIndeed, the derivation of estimate (6.40) is analogous to the proof of Theorem 6.4 with the only\ndifference that, instead of the non-uniform approximations of Lemma 6.2, one should use the uniform\napproximations of Lemma 6.6.\nRemark 6.8. In fact, we have proven a bit more than (6.22) or (6.40). Namely, recalling [37, Def. 4.1]\n(see also (3.7)), let us consider the M -distance to the set B\u03b5 defined by\ndistMu\u03b5 (t, B\u03b5 )\n(6.41)\nn\no\nn\n+\nn\n\u03b5\nw\nn\n:= inf lim inf dX0\u03b5 (U k (t), Pnk B\u03b5 ) : U = \u0398 \u2212 lim U k , U (0) = [X0 ] \u2212 lim U k (0) .\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nRecall that the external infimum is taken over all the sequences {U nk (t)}k\u2208N of Faedo-Galerkin approximations which \u0398+ -converge to the given solution U . Then, we may improve estimate (6.40) as\nfollows:\ndistMu\u03b5 (t, B\u03b5 ) \u2264 Q(Mu\u03b5 (0))e\u2212\u03b1t .\n(6.42)\nThis slight generalization is however important for applying the arguments based on the transitivity\nof exponential attraction, see [16] and next section.\n\n7\n\nExponential attractors for energy solutions\n\nIn this concluding section, we discuss the exponential attractors for problem (2.11). We start with the\ncase of small \u03b5 (and the 3D case for definiteness). We first recall that, due to Theorem 5.2 (see [25,\nThm. 2.7]), equations (2.11) are globally solvable in the class of more regular V1\u03b5 -solutions if the initial\ndata is not large enough and \u03b5 is small enough. More precisely, the equation generates a dissipative\nsemigroup S\u03b5 (t) on the set B\u03b5 \u2282 V1\u03b5 defined by (5.8) and, in particular, the phase space B\u03b5 of that\nsemigroup contains an R(\u03b5)-ball of the space V1\u03b5 with R(\u03b5) \u2192 \u221e as \u03b5 \u2192 0.\nRemark 7.1. It is worth observing that, on account of the results obtained in [25], we can argue as\nin [16] to prove that the family {(B\u03b5 , S\u03b5 (t))}\u03b5\u2208[0,\u03b5\u2032 ] , for some \u03b5\u2032 > 0 small enough, possesses a uniform\nfamily of exponential attractors M\u03b5 \u2282 V3\u03b5 \u2229 (H 4 \u00d7 H) with the following properties:\n(i) The sets M\u03b5 are uniformly bounded in H 4 \u00d7 H as \u03b5 \u2192 0.\n\n(ii) The sets M\u03b5 are compact in H 3 \u00d7 H \u22121 and their fractal dimensions are uniformly bounded, i.e.,\ndimf (M\u03b5 , H 3 \u00d7 H \u22121 ) \u2264 C,\n\nwhere C is independent of \u03b5 \u2192 0.\n\n(iii) The uniform exponential attraction property holds\ndistV1\u03b5 (S\u03b5 (t)B\u03b5 , M\u03b5 ) \u2264 Ce\u2212\u03b1t\n\n(7.1)\n\nwith positive C and \u03b1 independent of \u03b5 \u2192 0.\n\n(iv) M\u03b5 tends to the limit exponential attractor M0 as \u03b5 \u2192 0 in the following sense\n\u03ba\ndistsymm\nH 3 \u00d7H \u22121 (M\u03b5 , M0 ) \u2264 C\u03b5\n\nfor some positive \u03ba and C which are independent of \u03b5. We also recall that, as usual, in order to\ncompare the solutions of the hyperbolic equation (2.11) with \u03b5 > 0 and the solutions of the limit\nparabolic problem which corresponds to \u03b5 = 0, one needs to extend the limit parabolic semigroup to\nthe surface (see [4, 16] for details)\nS := {(u, v) \u2208 H 4 \u00d7 H, v = \u2212A(Au + f (u)) + g}.\nThe aim of this section is to verify that the above exponential attractors M\u03b5 attract exponentially not only the weak solutions (see (7.1)), but also all energy solutions of problem (2.11). Namely,\nthe following theorem holds.\n25\n\n\fTheorem 7.2. Let the assumptions of Theorem 2.2 hold. Then, there exists \u03b50 > 0 such that,\nfor every \u03b5 < \u03b50 , there exists a family of exponential attractors M\u03b5 satisfying the properties 1)-4)\nformulated above and, in addition, for every energy solution U \u2208 K\u03b5+ of problem (2.11),\ndistX0\u03b5 ((u, ut ), M\u03b5 ) \u2264 Q(Mu\u03b5 (0))e\u2212\u03b1t ,\n\n(7.2)\n\nwhere the positive constant \u03b1 and monotone function Q are independent of \u03b5, t and u.\nProof.\n\nIndeed, according to Corollary 6.7 and Remark 6.8,\ndistMu\u03b5 (t, B\u03b5 ) \u2264 Q(Mu\u03b5 (0))e\u2212\u03b1t ,\n\n(7.3)\n\nwhere Q and \u03b1 are independent of \u03b5 \u2264 \u03b50 , t and u. On the other hand, thanks to (7.1),\ndistV1\u03b5 (S\u03b5 (t)B\u03b5 , M\u03b5 ) \u2264 Ce\u2212\u03b1t\n\n(7.4)\n\nif \u03b5 > 0 is small enough (so that B\u03b5 \u2286 B\u03b5 , cf. (5.8)). Then, keeping in mind that V1\u03b5 \u2282 X0\u03b5 , we see\nthat, in order to prove estimate (7.2) through the transitivity of the exponential attraction (see [16,\nThm. 5.1], cf. also [37, Sec. 4]), we only need to check the following version of Lipschitz continuity\n(see [16, (5.1)]):\ndistMu\u03b5 (t, V (t)) \u2264 distMu\u03b5 (0, V (0))eKt ,\n(7.5)\n\nwhere \u03b5 > 0 is small enough, U \u2208 K\u03b5+ , V (t) := S\u03b5 (t)V0 , V0 \u2208 B\u03b5 , is an arbitrary strong solution\nof equation (2.11) starting from the set B\u03b5 and the positive constant K is independent of \u03b5, V and\nt. This Lipschitz continuity property can be easily verified arguing as in the proof of Theorem 4.4.\nIndeed, since (due to Theorem 5.2) the solution V (t) = (v(t), vt (t)) exists globally and satisfies the\ndissipative estimate, one can show that\nkv(t)k2H 4 + kvt (t)k2H 2 + \u03b5kvtt (t)k2H \u2264 R1 = Q(R0 ),\nwhere the constant R1 is independent of \u03b5, V (0) \u2208 B\u03b5 and t. Therefore, we have the uniform control\nkv(t)kL\u221e (\u03a9) + kvt (t)kL\u221e (\u03a9) \u2264 C,\n\n(7.6)\n\nwhere C is independent of \u03b5, t and V (0). Thus, defining V nk (t) = Pnk V (t), z nk := unk \u2212 v nk , where\nunk (t) are the Faedo-Galerkin approximations to the solution U \u2208 K\u03b5+ (see Section 3) and arguing\nexactly as in the proof of Theorem 4.4, we derive that\nd\nEznk (t) + \u03b1Eznk (t) \u2264 Ckhnk (t)k2H \u22121 ,\ndt\n\n(7.7)\n\nwhere Eznk and hnk are defined as in (4.68) and (4.78) (with \u0169 replaced by v) respectively. On the\nother hand, we have\nkhnk (t)k2H \u22121 \u2264 CkPnk (f (v(t)) \u2212 f (v nk (t))k2H 1 + CL2 Eznk (t),\nand applying the Gronwall inequality to (7.7), we have\nZ t\neK(t\u2212s) kPnk (f (v(s)) \u2212 f (v nk (s)))kH 1 ds,\nEznk (t) \u2264 Eznk (0)eKt + C\n0\n\nfor some positive C and K independent of u, v, nk , \u03b5 and t. Passing now to the limit k \u2192 \u221e and\nusing that the right-hand side tends to zero (note that v is smooth), we derive the desired Lipschitz\ncontinuity (7.5). Estimate (7.2) is now a standard corollary of transitivity of exponential attraction.\nThis finishes the proof of the theorem.\nWe now consider the 2D case with the growth restriction (5.1) for the nonlinearity f (at most\ncubic growth rate). Then, on account of [26, Thms. 2.2, 3.1 and 5.1]), the 2D problem (2.11) generates\na dissipative semigroup S\u03b5 (t) in the phase space V2\u03b5 for every finite \u03b5 > 0 and this semigroup possesses\nan exponential attractor M\u03b5 which is bounded in V3\u03b5 . Next theorem shows that this exponential\nattractor attracts exponentially the energy solutions as well.\n26\n\n\fTheorem 7.3. Let the assumptions of Theorem 5.1 hold. Then, for every \u03b5 > 0, the exponential attractor M\u03b5 for the quasistrong V2\u03b5 -solutions constructed in [26] attracts exponentially energy solutions\nas well. Namely, for any bounded set B \u2282 X0\u03b5 = V0\u03b5 , we have\ndistX0\u03b5 (S\u03b5 (t)B, M\u03b5 ) \u2264 Q(kBkX0\u03b5 )e\u2212\u03b1t ,\n\n(7.8)\n\nwhere the function Q and constant \u03b1 are independent of t and B, but may depend on \u03b5. Thus, M\u03b5 is\nan exponential attractor for the solution semigroup S\u03b5 (t) acting on the energy phase space X0\u03b5 as well.\nIndeed, the proof of this theorem repeats word by word the proof of the previous Theorem\n7.2, with the only difference that, instead of Corollary 6.7, one should use Theorem 6.4.\nTo conclude, we apply the proved exponential regularization for the 2D case to one problem\nwhich remained unsolved in the previous paper [26]. Namely, we have proved there that problem\n(2.11) with cubic growth restriction is well posed and dissipative in V0\u03b5 and V2\u03b5 , but the dissipativity\nin the phase space V1\u03b5 occurred surprisingly more delicate and remained an open issue. The next\ntheorem fills this gap without any restriction on \u03b5 (compare with [12, Thm. 5.3]).\nTheorem 7.4. Let the assumptions of Theorem 7.3 hold. Then, for every U (0) \u2208 V1\u03b5 , problem (2.11)\nis uniquely solvable in the phase space V1\u03b5 and the following dissipative estimate hold:\nkU (t)kV1\u03b5 \u2264 Q(kU (0)kV1\u03b5 )e\u2212\u03b1t + Q(kgkL2 ),\n\n(7.9)\n\nwhere the positive constant \u03b1 and monotone function Q are independent of t and U (0).\nProof.\nObviously, we only need to verify the dissipative estimate (7.9). As usual, we give only\nthe formal derivation which can be easily justified using the Galerkin approximations. The first step\nis completely standard: we multiply equation (2.11) by ut + \u03b3u where \u03b3 > 0 is a sufficiently small\npositive number and integrate over x. Then, after the straightforward transformations, we get\n1\nd\nZu (t) + \u03baZu (t) + \u03bakut k2L2 \u2264 C(1 + kgk2L2 + ku(t)k2H 1 ) + |(f \u2032\u2032 (u)|\u2207u|2 , ut )|,\ndt\n2\n\n(7.10)\n\nwhere \u03ba > 0 is small enough, C > 0,\nZu (t) :=\n\n\u0001\n1\n\u03b5kut k2H + kuk2H 2 + (f \u2032 (u)\u2207u, \u2207u) + L0 kuk2H + 2\u03b3\u03b5(u, ut) ,\n2\n\nand the constant L0 is chosen in such way that\n\nkkU (t)k2V2\u03b5 \u2264 Zu (t) \u2264 Q(kU (t)kV2\u03b5 )\n\n(7.11)\n\nfor some k > 0 and some monotone function Q. Thus, the main problem is how to estimate the last\nterm in the right-hand side of (7.10).\nActually, if we use the Br\u00e9zis-Gallouet logarithmic inequality together with the fact that\n|f \u2032\u2032 (u)| \u2264 C(1 + |u|) (cf. [8], see also [26, (2.34)]), we obtain\n|(f \u2032\u2032 (u)|\u2207u|2 , ut )| \u2264 \u03bakut k2H + C(1 + kuk2L\u221e )k\u2207uk4L4\n\u2264\n\n\u2264\n\nC(1 + kuk2H 1 ) ln(1 + kuk2H 2 )k\u2207uk4L4\nC \u2032 (1 + kuk2H 1 )k\u2207uk4L4 ln(1 + Zu (t))\n\n(7.12)\n\n+ \u03bakut k2H\n+ \u03bakut k2H .\n\nNotice now that, if we simply employ\nk\u2207uk4L4 \u2264 Ck\u2207uk2H kuk2H 2 \u2264 C1 kuk2H 1 Zu (t),\nthen (using also the X0\u03b5 -energy estimate for the solution U ) we end up with an inequality of the form\n\u0001\nd\nZu (t) + \u03baZu (t) \u2264 CZu (t) 1 + ln(1 + Zu (t) + C1 ,\ndt\n\nwhich is enough to verify the global existence; however, the V2\u03b5 -norm of the solution will diverge in\ntime as a double exponential. Thus, in order to obtain the desired dissipative estimate, we have to\n27\n\n\fproceed more carefully. Namely, thanks to Theorem 6.4, we can split the solution u(t) = v(t) + w(t),\nwhere\nkv(t)kH 4 \u2264 2R0 , kw(t)kH 1 \u2264 Q(kU (0)kX0\u03b5 )e\u2212\u03b1t ,\n(7.13)\n\nfor some R0 > 0, and estimate the L4 -norm of \u2207u as follows\n\nk\u2207uk4L4 \u2264 8(k\u2207vk4L4 + k\u2207wk4L4 ) \u2264 C(R04 + kwk2H 1 kwk2H 2 )\n\n\u2264 C(1 + Q(kU (0)kX0\u03b5 )e\u2212\u03b1t ku \u2212 vk2H 2 ) \u2264 C + Q(kU (0)kX0\u03b5 )e\u2212\u03b1t (1 + Zu (t)).\n\nInserting this estimate into the right-hand sides of (7.12) and (7.10) and using the dissipative estimate\nfor the X0\u03b5 -energy norm of U (t), we end up with the refined differential inequality\nd\nZu (t) + \u03baZu (t) \u2264 Q(kU (0)kX0\u03b5 )e\u2212\u03b1t Zu (t) ln(1 + Zu (t)) + Q(kgkH ) + Q(kU (0)kX0\u03b5 )e\u2212\u03b1t .\ndt\n\n(7.14)\n\nIt remains to note that (see proof of [26, Thm. 3.1]) the differential inequality (7.14) gives indeed the\ndesired dissipative estimate (7.9) and finishes the proof of the theorem.\nRemark 7.5. As we have already mentioned in Remark 6.5, the functions Q in Theorems 7.3 and 7.4\ndepend on the rate of convergence of weak energy solutions to the smooth global attractor A\u03b5 and,\nby this reason, we cannot find the explicit expressions of Q in terms of the physical parameters of\nthe system. This drawback can be overcome if we construct the smooth approximate solutions not by\nusing the fact that the energy trajectories tend to the smooth global attractor, but rather observing\nthat these trajectories visit regularly any arbitrarily small neighborhood of the equilibria set (which\nfollows from the existence of a global Lyapunov functional) and the smoothness of the set of equilibria.\nHowever, this argument is much more delicate and, in order to avoid the related technicalities, we will\nnot present it here.\n\nReferences\n[1] A.
