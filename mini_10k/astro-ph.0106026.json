NGC 1901 is often des ribed as an open\nluster while NGC 1252 onsists of a on entration of about 20 stars entered \u2248 20\u2032 north of the original New General Catalogue oordinates, and\nat the southwest edge of the large region previously assigned to this obje t\nin the literature. NGC 1901 has a lear main sequen e and shares similarities with the Hyades. We derive a reddening value E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.04,\na distan e from the Sun d\u2299 = 0.45 kp (Z = \u22120.23 kp ) and an age\n0.6 \u00b1 0.1 Gyr. NGC 1901 is on lusively a physi al system, dynami ally\nomparable to or more evolved than the Hyades. The olour-magnitude\ndiagram of NGC 1252 suggests a turno\u001b and main sequen e, and a total\nof 12 probable members. We simulated the Gala ti \u001celd olour - magnitude diagram in the same dire tion and found it to be a poor mat h to\nNGC 1252, suggesting that NGC 1252 is not a \u001celd \u001du tuation. Iso hrone\n\u001ctting to the probable members is onsistent with E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.02,\nd\u2299 = 0.64 kp (Z = \u22120.46 kp ) and an age 3 \u00b1 1 Gyr. NGC 1252 annot\nbe ruled out as a physi al group with the available data. If so, eviden e\nis found that it is not a lassi al open luster, but rather an open luster\nremnant.\n\nKey words:The Galaxy: open\n\nlusters and stellar asso iations: individual:\nNGC 1901, NGC 1252\n\n1 Introdu tion\nOpen lusters dynami ally evolve and eventually dissolve. They appear to behave as weakly bound or slightly unbound systems. Catalogues in lude many\npoorly populated and/or low density stellar on entrations whi h may have different natures su h as luster remnants, parts of asso iations, quasi-asso iations\nand multiple star systems, or non-physi al e\u001be ts su h as \u001celd \u001du tuations.\nLod\u00e9n (1977) presented a list of relatively loose young on entrations that probably have never been bound. The Basel obje ts (e.g. Hassan 1974) are on entrations whi h appear to be physi al stellar groups, in ontrast to on entrations\nprodu ed by random \u001du tuations in \u001celds of Milky Way stars (e.g. Rupre ht 46\n- Carraro & Patat 1995).\nWielen (1971) studied the evolution and dissolution time s ale of open lusters. Re ently, numeri al simulations suggested that many on entrations may\n1\n\n\fbe open luster remnants (e.g. de la Fuente Mar os 1998). Bassino et al. (2000)\n\u001cnd eviden e of a possible remnant - M 73 (NGC 6994), but Carraro (2000) does\nnot favour it. Bi a et al. (2001) presented 34 dissolving star luster andidates\nwhi h are lo ated at relatively high gala ti latitudes (|b| > 15\u25e6 ) and are underpopulated with respe t to usual open lusters, but they possess a signi\u001c ant\nnumber density ontrast as ompared to the Gala ti \u001celd. The distin tion between an open luster and a remnant is not obvious both observationally and\ntheoreti ally. An open luster remnant an be de\u001cned as a poorly populated\non entration of stars as a result of the dynami al evolution of an initially more\nmassive physi al system. A widely a epted open luster su h as the Hyades appears to have lost 90 % of the original stellar ontent (Weidemann et al. 1992).\nAt the other extreme a binary star, the ultimate remains of a dissolved open\nluster, is a luster remnant. In the present study a luster remnant is de\u001cned\nas a poorly populated physi al on entration of stars with enough members to\nshow evolutionary sequen es in a olour-magnitude diagram (CMD).\nNGC 1252 was dis ussed in Bi a et al. (2001), who refer to a stellar on entration at the southwest edge of Bou het & Th\u00e9`s (1983) de\u001cnition of NGC 1252,\nwhi h is a sparse olle tion of stars in a mu h larger \u001celd. NGC 1252 is des ribed\nin the NGC as a star luster ontaining 18 or 20 stars. It is lo ated in Horologium\nwith original oordinates (available e.g. in Sulenti & Ti\u001bt 1973) orresponding\nto J2000 \u03b1 = 3h 10m 31s , \u03b4 = \u221258\u25e6 08\u2032 22\u2032\u2032 (l = 274.\u25e6 59, b = \u221250.\u25e664). All \u03b1,\n\u03b4 values in the present study will refer to the epo h J2000.0. Bou het & Th\u00e9\n(1983, hereafter BT) observed 38 stars with UBVRI photometry in a 1\u25e6 diameter region entered on the bright arbon star TW Horologii (\u03b1 = 3h 12m 33.2s ,\n\u03b4 = \u221257\u25e6 19\u2032 18\u2032\u2032 and l = 273.\u25e630, b = \u221250.\u25e6 90). They onsidered 16 as probable\nmembers, in luding TW Hor (BT 38) itself, and estimated a distan e from the\nSun d\u2299 = 470 p . Using CZC proper motions Eggen (1984) on luded that\nBT\u2032 s luster was non-existent and that TW Hor (d\u2299 = 400 p ) probably belonged to the Hyades Super luster. Using proper motions ontained in the ACT\nand Hippar os atalogues Baumgardt (1998) also on luded that the luster as\ninterpreted by BT is non-existent.\nCCD photometry is obtained for NGC 1252 as in Bi a et al. (2001) at\n\u03b1 = 3h 10m 49s , \u03b4 = \u221257\u25e6 46\u2032 00\u2032\u2032 (l = 274.\u25e6 08, b = \u221250.\u25e6 83). This on entration\nan be seen in Fig. 1 of BT as the small group en ompassed by the bright stars\nBT 1 and 13. An XDSS (se ond generation Digitized Sky Survey) blow-up of\nthe on entration was shown in Fig. 4 of Bi a et al. (2001). We emphasize that\nthe present set of stars related to the on entration is not BT\u2032 s set of members.\nWe also address the ru ial point of the distin tion between an open luster\nand an open luster remnant. We deepen the photometry of the poorly populated open luster or stellar group NGC 1901 for omparisons with NGC 1252.\nNGC 1901 at \u03b1 = 5h 18m 11s , \u03b4 = \u221268\u25e627\u2032 00\u2032\u2032 (l = 279.\u25e6 03, b = \u221233.\u25e660) is\nlo ated in Dorado and was reported by Bok & Bok (1960) as a loose stellar\ngrouping. Sanduleak & Philip (1968, hereafter SP) by means of BV photometry\non luded that NGC 1901 was a nearby Gala ti stellar group proje ted onto\nthe LMC. They found a turno\u001b near A0, a reddening value E(B-V)= 0.065 and\ndistan e from the Sun d \u2299 = 330 p . Murray et al. (1969) arried out astrom2\n\n\fetry for SP \u2032 s stars with Cape Astrographi plates taken over more than 60\nyears. They found that 14 of them have proper motions in ommon and alled\nthe obje t a star luster. However, despite the on lusion of it being a physi al\nsystem there remains the doubt whether NGC 1901 is a lassi al open luster or\na remnant, or some transition state. In Bi a et al. (2001) NGC 1901 was taken\nas a omparison loose luster and the number density ontrast was important.\nSe t. 2 des ribes observations and redu tions. Se t. 3 dis usses the omparison\nobje t NGC 1901. Se t. 4 dis usses the properties of NGC 1252. In Se t. 5\nwe ompare the present obje ts with the Hyades and dis uss the possibility of\nremnant physi al systems. Con luding remarks are given in Se t. 6.\n\n2 Observations and redu tions\nThe observations of NGC 1252 and NGC 1901 were a quired at the C\u00f3rdoba\nUniversity Bosque Alegre Astrophysi al Station, Argentina, on the night 28\nDe ember 1998, using a 30 m S hmidt-Cassegrain teles ope of the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, temporarily installed at the site. CCD\nimages with the B and V \u001clters were olle ted with a KODAK KAF-0400 hip\nof 768\u00d7512 pixels and size 9\u03bcm\u00d79\u03bcm, orresponding to a \u001celd 12.\u2032 4\u00d78.\u2032 3 on\nthe sky. We employed 3 B and 2 V frames of exposure time 20 se ., and 1 B\nframe and 1 V frame of 40 se . We illustrate a CCD V image of NGC 1252 in\nFig. 1 whi h in ludes most of the on entration.\nThe redu tions were arried out with IRAF starting with bias, dark, and \u001dat\n\u001celd orre tions. We ombined the images for better S/N ratios. DAOPHOT\n(Stetson 1992) was used to extra t stars and derive instrumental magnitudes.\nWe show in Fig. 2 the DAOPHOT (B-V) and V internal errors as a fun tion of\nV mag for NGC 1252: \u01ebV and \u01eb(B\u2212V ) attain 0.05 for V \u2248 15. We alibrated the\ndata using stars from BT\u2032 s photoeletri observations in the frame, sin e our main\nobje tive was to deepen their photometry in the stellar on entration area and\nhe k whether a signi\u001c ant MS ould be present. All stars share the airmass X\n\u2248 1.19, and previous to the standard system transformation we orre ted them\nfor this e\u001be t. We used the site average atmospheri extin tion oe\u001e ients\nKV = 0.16 and K(B\u2212V ) = 0.13 (Minniti et al. 1989). The adopted standard\nstars are BT 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 27. The resulting transformation\nequations to the standard system are\nV = 17.83 + v + 1.61\u00d7(b \u2212 v)\n(B \u2212 V ) = \u22121.16 + 1.60\u00d7(b \u2212 v)\n\nwhere v and (b \u2212 v) are the instrumental values orre ted for atmospheri\nextin tion. The external errors were estimated as the r.m.s. of the di\u001beren es betwen standard and al ulated values, and we obtained \u03c1V = 0.13 and\n\u03c1(B\u2212V ) = 0.04.\nThe bright stars BT 1 (\u03b1 = 03h 10m 50.0s , \u03b4 = \u221257\u25e642\u2032 06\u2032\u2032 ) and BT 11\n3\n\n\fFigure 1: V CCD image of NGC 1252 with exposure 40 se .

We adopt\nBT\u2032 s photoeletri values for BT 1 (V = 8.68, (B \u2212 V ) = 1.03) and BT 11 (V =\n10.50, (B \u2212 V ) = 1.05).

The results\nare shown in Table 1, by Col(s).: (1) identi\u001c ation, (2) and (3) J2000 equatorial\noordinates, (4) and (5) stars with photoeletri V and (B-V) values from BT,\n(6) and (7) present CCD photometry in V and (B-V), and (8) membership.\nFor NGC 1901 we used 1 B and 1 V 10 se . frames, and 3 B and 3 V 30 se .\nframes. The obje t was observed at X \u2248 1.45, and the instrumental magnitudes\nwere orre ted a ordingly. As standard stars we used SP 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13,\n14, 15 and 16. The distribution of the photometri internal errors is similar to\nthat of NGC 1252 in Fig. 2, ex ept that \u01eb(B\u2212V ) attains 0.05 for V \u2248 14.5. The\nexternal errors are \u03c1V = 0.04 and \u03c1(B\u2212V ) = 0.01. The results are in Table 2\nwhere we also indi ate the SP values for omparison purposes.

A gain of \u2206V \u2248 4 mag is obtained with respe t to SP\u2032 s photometry. The bright stars in the CCD area de\u001cne a MS. The evolved star HD 35294\n(TYC2 573) was not in luded by SP in their sample, and it was saturated in our\nframes. We adopted Johnson V = 8.40, (B-V) = 0.70 values derived from the\nTy ho photometry, whi h are a urate for su h bright stars. We superimposed\non the CMD the NW extension stars (upwards open triangles) using SP values,\nwhi h basi ally follow the upper MS and turno\u001b (TO) of the entral stars. The\nSP stars to the south outside the CCD area (downwards open triangles) are loated along the MS. Both the NW extension and the south stars are ompatible\nin the CMD with the bulk of entral stars of NGC 1901.\nNGC 1901 is proje ted onto the young LMC dis , and luminous LMC stars\nare expe ted. The LMC intermediate age dis (Bi a et al. 1998, 1999) provides\nluminous AGB stars at the limit of the present photometry. The LMC RGB tip\nis below our limit, and the lump of red supergiants at an age \u2248 10 Myr, su h\nas that in the LMC luster NGC 2004 (Ben ivenni et al. 1991), is far too red\n(V \u2248 13.2, (B-V) \u2248 1.55) to ontaminate the MS of NGC 1901. We on lude\nthat LMC intermediate olour supergiants and some bright AGB stars are the\nmain \u001celd ontributors. This an be seen in the Shapley III \u001celds (Dolphin\n& Hunter 1998) in the young LMC dis north of the bar, likewise the LMC\npart onto whi h NGC 1901 is proje ted. Probable LMC members (Table 2) are\nlo ated bluewards of the dashed line in Fig. 3. We annot rule out some LMC\nontamination in the observed lower MS of NGC 1901.\nWe employed solar metalli ity Padova iso hrones (Girardi et al. 2000) of\ndi\u001berent ages for best \u001ct solutions (Fig. 3) and parameters. We \u001cnd a reddening\nvalue E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.04 and an apparent distan e modulus (m \u2212 M ) = 8.37. The\niso hrones orrespond to ages 0.5, 0.6 and 0.9 Gyr, from whi h we estimate an\nage 0.6 \u00b1 0.1 Gyr for NGC 1901, thus similar to that of the Hyades (WEBDA,\nWeidemann et al. 1998). The 0.6 Gyr iso hrone basi ally \u001cts a TO distribution\nand HD 35294, whi h is thus a photometri ally probable member. The latter\nstar together with\np all those ompatible with the 0.6 Gyr iso hrone within total\nolour errors \u01eb2 + \u03c12 (Se t. 2), are indi ated as probable members in Table\n2. The star GCS 0916200216 is too red and was lassi\u001ced as a non-member.\nUsing the total-to-sele tive extin tion ratio RV = 3.1 we obtain AV = 0.12.\nThe absolute distan e modulus is (m \u2212 M )\u25e6 = 8.25 \u00b1 0.20. The distan e from\nthe Sun is d\u2299 \u2248 0.45 \u00b1 0.04 kp , thus somewhat larger than that derived\nby SP. Assuming a solar Gala to entri distan e of 8 kp (Reid 1993), the\nGala to entri oordinates are X = \u22127.87 kp , Y = \u22120.37 kp , Z = \u22120.23 kp\n(X < 0 is our side of the Galaxy). The Gala to entri distan e is RGC = 7.88\nkp , thus a nearly solar ir le obje t. It is lo ated at \u2248 230 p below the Gala ti\nplane, where younger dis omponents are less probable.\nAstrometry in the region is signi\u001c ant for proper motions but not for parallaxes. In the CCD area HD 35183 (HIP 24652 or SP 7) has a parallax p = 1.22\n\u00b1 0.87 mas and a orresponding distan e d\u2299 = 820\u2212342\n+2037 p . Within un ertainties this TO star of spe tral type A2 has a distan e ompatible with that of\n\n7\n\n\fNGC 1901 derived from the CMD. The other Hippar os stars are outside the\nCCD area. HD 35230 (HIP 24671) has p = 3.47 \u00b1 0.78 mas and d\u2299 = 288\u221253\n+81\np whi h is marginally ompatible with that of NGC 1901, but Johnson photometry V = 7.57, (B-V) = 0.86 provided in the Hippar os atalogue, and most\nof all Ty ho proper motions \u03bc\u03b1 = -17.4\u00b1 1.1 mas/yr, \u03bc\u03b4 = -0.8\u00b1 1.1 mas/yr\nindi ate that it is not a member. HD 269320 (HIP 24763) with p = 8.91 \u00b1 1.97\nmas and d\u2299 = 112\u221220\n+32 p is in the foreground. We show in Fig. 4 a sky hart\nfor a Ty ho extra tion of diameter 60\u2032 entered in NGC 1901. The large ir le\nen ompasses the CCD data, where most of the stars share motions (Table 2)\nindi ating a physi al system, in agreement with Murray et al. (1969). The stars\nin the NW extension basi ally move in the same dire tion as the entral stars.\nThe proper motion moduli are omparable: 9.3 \u00b1 3.3 mas/yr for 10 stars in\nthe entral part and 12.4 \u00b1 9.7 mas/yr for 4 stars in the NW extension. The\ndispersions are not intrinsi be ause they are of the order of the proper motion\nerrors. A few additional stars are ompatible with the entral on entration\nand NW extension stars, and ould be related to a orona - see M 73 (Bassino\net al. 2000). The age and distan e of the stars in the entral and NW on entrations are similar, and it remains to be studied whether the substru tures are\nthe result of the evolution of a parent initial luster, an intera tion or a lose\napproa h. In parti ular, proje tion e\u001be ts of tidal arms might ause a se ondary\non entration, a ording to N-body simulations (Combes et al. 1999).\n\n4 The stellar group NGC 1252\nFig. 5 shows the V \u00d7 (B-V) CMDpwith the 12 stars from the present photometry and total olour error bars \u01eb2 + \u03c12 (Se t. 2). Also shown are the 4\nomplementary BT stars in the area (BT 1, 11, 13 and 28). The fainter stars in\nthe CMD were observed for the \u001crst time. The CMD suggests a MS and possibly some related giants. We used Padova iso hrones of di\u001berent ages, together\nwith reddening onstraints to \u001cnd best \u001ct solutions.\nThe bright giants BT 1 (K1 III/IV) and BT 13 (G8 III) have Hippar os\nparallaxes p = 10.24 \u00b1 0.78 mas and p = 5.48 \u00b1 0.54 mas, respe tively. The\norresponding distan es are d\u2299 = 98 \u00b1 8 p and d\u2299 = 182 \u00b1 16 p . Both\nstars together annot belong to a possible physi al stellar group. In Fig. 5 we\nsuperimpose the best iso hrone \u001cts. The reddening was estimated taking into\na ount two methods. S hlegel et al.\u2032 s (1998) reddening maps are based on dust\nthermal emission and provide in this dire tion E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.02. Burstein &\nHeiles\u2032 (1982) reddening maps are based on H I olumn densities and galaxy\nounts and indi ate an absen e of reddening in the area. We on lude that\nE(B \u2212 V ) = 0.02 is ompatible with the MS for intermediate ages and an\napparent distan e modulus (m \u2212 M ) = 9.1. From the 2 and 4 Gyr iso hrones we\nestimate an age 3\u00b11 Gyr for NGC 1252. With AV = 0.062 and (m\u2212M )\u25e6 = 9.04\n\u00b10.25 we obtain d\u2299 \u2248 0.64 \u00b1 0.07 kp . The distan e modulus error is by\nfar dominated by verti al un ertainties in the CMD \u001ct. The Gala to entri\noordinates are X = \u22127.82 kp , Y = \u22120.41 kp and Z = \u22120.46 kp .

It is lo ated at \u2248 460 p below the Gala ti plane,\nonsistent with the old dis distribution (Friel 1995).\nThe star BT 17 was lassi\u001ced as a non-member (Table 1) be ause it is too red\nwith respe t to the iso hrones.

The CCD photometry of the Guide Star Catalogue entries GSC\n0849800928, 0849800945 and 0849801024 (Table 1) allowed us to lassify them\nas probable members taking into a ount the olour error bars and the possibility of a double star sequen e parallel to the MS. The star GSC 0849801321 is\nlassi\u001ced as a non member be ause it is mu h bluer than the iso hrones\u2032 MS.\nIndeed it is lo ated in the CMD region orresponding to the bulk of \u001celd stars\n(Se t. 4.1). The stars BT 1 and 13 are bluer than the iso hrone giant bran h,\nwhi h indi ates that they are not members. This is supported by their large\nparallaxes, lo ating them loser than what we \u001cnd for NGC 1252. BT 11 is a\nprobable member from its subgiant bran h lo us. Finally, BT 28 appears to be\na probable member belonging to the TO region.\nThe present gain of \u2206V \u2248 2 mag with respe t to BT allows one to probe\nlower along the MS , whi h is a onstraint for the TO, and iso hrone \u001ctting.\nThree additional GSC stars are present in the CCD images. A ording to the\nGSC, they are slightly fainter than those measured in Table 1. Assuming the\nadditional stars as members their total number in the range 14 < V < 16 would\nbe 6. Note that the iso hrones (Fig. 5) have most probable members on the red\nMS side. This suggests them preferentially as part of a double star sequen e,\nwhi h is expe ted for a luster remnant stellar ontent. Binary star sequen es\nhave been observed e.g. in the globular luster 47 Tu anae (Santiago et al.\n1996a) and the young LMC luster NGC1818 (Elson et al. 1998). Globular\nlusters appear to have a smaller binary fra tion than open lusters. In the\nglobular luster NGC 2808 Ferraro et al (1997) obtained a fra tion of 24 %. For\nthe post- ore- ollapse globular luster NGC 6752 (Rubenstein & Bailyn 1997)\nthe overall fra tion is low (< 16 %) ex ept in the inner ore (15 - 38 %). Gonz\u00e1lez\n& Lapasset (2000) estimated a fra tion of 26 % (46 % in luding all suspe ted\nbinaries) in the open luster NGC 2516. From 167 bright Hyades members\n(Patien e et al. 1998) the dete ted multipli ity is 59 binaries and 10 triples.\nThis dynami ally evolved open luster has a dete ted binary fra tion of 41 %.\nBinary fra tions in globular lusters annot be dire tly ompared to those in\nopen lusters, sin e loose binaries are thought to be destroyed at initially higher\ndensities. Nevertheless in an advan ed dynami al state for an open luster\nor remnant one does not expe t binaries to be destroyed by stellar intera tions.\nComparing the number of MS and TO stars on either side of the \u001ctted iso hrones\nfor NGC 1252 (Fig. 5) a high binary fra tion of 67 % is obtained. The statisti s\nis low, but taking this fra tion at fa e value NGC 1252 would be onsistent with\na late dynami al state.\n13\n\n\f4.1 Comparison with a \u001celd model\nWe wish to ompare the on entration CMD with that expe ted from \u001celd\nstars in the same dire tion and limiting magnitude, following Bassino et al.\n(2000). Bi a et al. (2001) have ompared integral star ounts down to a limiting\nmagnitude in their \u001celds to those expe ted from a Gala ti stru ture model. We\nuse the same model as starting point to build a theoreti al CMD of \u001celd stars\nin the dire tion of NGC 1252. This model has been des ribed in more detail\nby Reid & Majewski (1993) and Santiago et al. (1996b). A re ent appli ation\nof the method to Gala ti \u001celds was arried out by Kerber et al. (2001). It\nin ludes 3 stru tural omponents: a thin dis , a thi k dis and spheroid. The\ndis s stellar density pro\u001cles are des ribed by double exponentials, one along\nthe plane of the dis and the other perpendi ular to it. The stellar luminosity\nfun tion is well onstrained down to MV \u2248 12. Given the magnitude limit (V \u2248\n15.5) for the on entration stars, our star ounts are almost entirely dominated\nby the thin dis .\nGiven a dire tion, limiting magnitude and solid angle, the model provides\nexpe ted numbers of stars throughout the CMD plane. In Fig. 6 we show a\nmodel CMD for a region of diameter 1\u25e6 around the on entration. This large\narea provides a statisti ally signi\u001c ant CMD. The iso hrones on the right panel\nare from Fig. 5. They do not \u001ct the bulk of \u001celd stars, whi h are onsiderably\nbluer in average. The iso hrones are an upper envelope to the bulk of \u001celd stars\nand onsequently NGC 1252 appears to be lo ated in the \u001celd foreground. In\nFig. 7 we present a similar CMD but for the small solid angle of the CCD data.\nThis sample was randomly taken from the expe ted model ounts in ea h CMD\nell (s aled to the smaller solid angle) and allowing for Poisson \u001du tuations.\nAs expe ted, a typi al small \u001celd CMD will be populated preferentially with\nstars from the densest CMD zone in the large area (Fig. 6). However, although\nstatis ally unlikely, one annot rule out a \u001du tuation produ ing a CMD similar\nto that of the on entration. The model CMD (Fig. 6) extends down to V \u2248 17,\nsin e unlike the CCD data limit (Fig. 7), it is not a\u001be ted by in ompleteness.\nIn the parti ular small \u001celd sampling the iso hrones are lo ated redwards of\nthe arti\u001c ial stars sampled. The NGC 1252 stars suggesting a MS (Fig. 5) are\ndistributed in a region mu h narrower than the model stars (Fig. 6). These\nomparisons give support to the existen e of a physi al stellar group.\n\n4.2 Available astrometry\nWe extra ted Ty ho stars within a 80\u2032 diameter entered in the on entration.\nWe show in Fig. 8 a sky hart with proper motions proportional to arrow sizes.\nThe large ir le has a diameter of 14\u2032 and orresponds to the present stellar\non entration. Note that stars fainter than V \u2248 12 are absent in the Ty ho\natalogue. The bright giants BT 1 and 13 have di\u001berent proper motions, in\nagreement with their di\u001berent parallaxes. They are foreground \u001celd giants with\nrespe t to NGC 1252. The probable member BT 11 and the less probable one\nBT 15 (Table 1) present proper motions signi\u001c antly di\u001berent (\u03bc\u03b1 = +15.7\u00b1\n14\n\n\f5\n\n2 Gyr\n\n8\n4 Gyr\n\nV\n\n11\n\n14\n\n17\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n1.5\nB\u2212V\n\n2\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n1.5\nB\u2212V\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\nFigure 6: Left panel: V \u00d7 (B-V) diagram predi ted by the Gala ti stru ture\nmodel for a region of diameter 1\u25e6 in the same dire tion as NGC 1252.

Outside\nthe on entration area (Fig. 8) three Hippar os stars o ur: HIP 14930 (TW\n+603\nHor) at d\u2299 = 403+118\n\u221274 p , HIP 15176 at d\u2299 = 397\u2212149 p and HIP 14975 at d\u2299\n+630\n= 630\u2212210 p . From the distan es and/or Johnson photometry in the Hippar os\natalogue, we on luded that they are non-members.\nThe available proper motions are not deep enough to study the TO and MS\n(Fig. 5). The faint stars (12 < V < 15.5) would be ne essary for a on lusive\nproper motions result. A autionary remark for proper motions and parallaxes\nbased on observations spanning a few years, su h as Ty ho and Hippar os data,\nis binarity. Early plates in the XX entury like ACT\u2032 s ombined to subsequent\nimages an lessen the problem, but not for binaries with periods longer than\n100-200 years (Baumgardt 1998).\nBased on N-body simulations Terlevi h (1987) showed that a orona is expe ted after 300-400 Myr of evolution, and that su h stars are likely to es ape in\nthe near future. We show in Fig. 9 the CMD of stars outside the on entration\narea with BT photometry. We distinguish BT\u2032 s members and non-members. We\nsuperimpose the present iso hrone solution (Fig. 5), whi h suggests that most of\ntheir non-members in the TO region are ompatible with our interpretation of\nNGC 1252. A few giants onsidered by them to be members are as well possible\nmembers in our interpretation owing to their proximity to the iso hrones. We\non lude that 13 stars are ompatible with the iso hrones. Eight are marked\nin the Ty ho hart (Fig. 8), sin e 2 are absent in the Ty ho atalogue and\n3 are outside the extra tion. The marked stars are distributed on one side of\nthe on entration be ause it is lo ated at the edge of BT\u2032 s large region. Six\nmarked stars have proper motions ompatible within un ertainties either with\nthe probable member BT 11 or the less probable member BT 15, and they ould\nbe members of a orona, as seen in M 73 (Bassino et al. 2000). Ty ho errors\nan be as large as 5 mas/yr for these stars, whi h at the obje t distan e of 0.64\nkp implies transversal velo ity errors of \u2248 15 km/s. Sin e velo ity dispersions\nin open lusters are mu h lower (e.g. 0.23 km/s for the Hyades, Gunn et al.\n1988) no inferen e an be made about internal motions in the present obje t.\n\n5 Comparisons with the Hyades\nThe luminosity fun tion (LF) an provide information on luster mass and\ndynami al state. We take the Hyades as template to infer the properties of\nthe present obje ts. We have sele ted and homogenized stars with V < 11\n(WEBDA), whi h en ompass the available absolute mag intervals for NGC 1901\nand NGC 1252. Adopting (m-M)0 = 3.32 for the Hyades (WEBDA, Weidemann\net al. 1992) we omputed MV for orresponding giants, TO and MS stars whi h\nform the referen e histograms in Fig(s). 10 and 11. For NGC 1901 and NGC\n1252 we omputed the MV histograms using the derived parameters and their\n20 and 12 probable members, respe tively (Se ts. 3 and 4). We employed 181\nHyades members in the magnitude range of Fig. 10, and 147 in that of Fig. 11.\n17\n\n\f40\nN\nW\n\nE\nS\n\n20\n\n0\n\n-20\n\n-40\n-40\n\n-20\n\n0\nX(arcmin)\n\n20\n\n40\n\nFigure 8: NGC 1252: sky hart of Ty ho stars in a region of diameter 80\u2032\nentered in the present on entration.

Continuous lines: same\nNGC 1252 iso hrone solution as in Fig. 5.\n\n19\n\n\fWe show in Fig. 10 per entage fra tions with respe t to the total population of probable members in the available absolute mag range for NGC 1901, as\nompared to the Hyades. The histogram shapes are similar indi ating a omparable mass fun tion slope in the available range. CCD observations in the\nwhole obje t area would improve the statisti s in the present mag range, and\ndeeper observations might reveal the behaviour of the low MS. The population\nratio of stars in the two obje ts is RP = 9.1, whi h suggests that the Hyades\nare this fa tor more massive than NGC 1901 as sampled by the CCD. However,\nSP members with proper motions from Murray et al. (1969) and the present\nTy ho analyses indi ate 10 bright members in the CCD area and 10 outside it.\nThis would indi ate a mass ratiom MHyades / MN GC 1901 = 4.6, assuming that\nboth obje ts are in a similar dynami al state with equally populated lower MS.\nIn Fig. 11 we ompare the LFs of NGC 1252 and the Hyades. The shapes\nare similar despite the limited population of stars for NGC 1252. In this ase\nthe obje t is essentially ontained in the CCD so that RP = 12.3, and the mass\nratio is thus MHyades /MN GC 1252 = 12.3, again under the assumption that\nboth obje ts are in a similar dynami al state. It would be important to probe\nthe lower MS (MV > 6).\nThe Hyades have a nearly \u001dat urrent mass fun tion and appear to have\nlost \u2248 90 % of an estimated total initial mass of 14000 M \u2299 (Weidemann et\nal. 1992). In this sense the Hyades an be onsidered an open luster remnant\ndespite the fa t that they are widely a epted as an open luster. NGC 1901 and\nNGC 1252 have similar LFs as that of the Hyades in the available luminosity\nrange, although they di\u001ber in terms of s aling fa tor. The inferred lower total\nmasses, espe ially that of NGC 1252 for whi h eviden e of a high binary fra tion\nwas found (Se t. 4), favour the on ept of an open luster remnant.\n\n6 Con luding remarks\nWe provide CCD photometry of the stellar groups NGC 1901 and NGC 1252,\nprobing them deeper than in the literature. We also explore the available Hippar os and Ty ho astrometries. The photometry on\u001crms that NGC 1901 is a\nphysi al system whi h is also supported by proper motions. For NGC 1252 we\ndes ribe a di\u001berent set of stars as ompared to the obje t interpreted by Bou het\n& Th\u00e9 (1983), and questioned by Eggen (1984) and Baumgardt (1998). The\npresent CMD suggests a TO and MS, so that a physi al stellar group annot be\nruled out. The available astrometry is not helpful enough to onstrain properties\nof this obje t.\nNGC 1901 has an age omparable to that of the Hyades and their dynami al\nstates are similar within the available LF range for NGC 1901. It would be\nimportant to further deepen NGC 1901\u2032 s photometry to verify if depletion of\nlower MS stars o urs with respe t to the Hyades, whi h would be the signature\nof a more evolved dynami al state. NGC 1252 is onsistent with the notion of\nan old open luster remnant, similar to M 73 (Bassino et al. 2000). NGC 1901\nappear to a fa tor 4.6 less massive than the Hyades, while NGC 1252 is a fa tor\n20\n\n\f30\nNGC1901\nHYADES\n\n25\n\nTO HYADES\nTO NGC1901\n\n20\n\nf(%) 15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u22121\n\n1\n\n3\nMV\n\n5\n\n7\n\nFigure 10: Absolute V luminosity fun tion of NGC 1901 ompared to that of\nthe Hyades.

Binary fra tion studies are fundamental too. Finally, from theoreti al\nand numeri al al ulations it would be important to establish riteria to lassify late stages of open luster dynami al evolution and subsequent remnants.\nThe in lusion of binaries and triples is ru ial in the models. As a \u001crst step,\nthe Hyades themselves require a lear determination of the dynami al state and\nlassi\u001c ation as open luster or open luster remnant.\n\nA knowledgements\nWe thank an anonymous referee for important remarks, the students M.
