INTRODUCTION\n\nWith the development of integrated magneto-resistive memory devices the need to produce very many magnetic cells with reproducible magnetic switching behavior has arisen.\nAs the dimensions of these devices reach orders of a few 100nm, the switching behavior is\nto good approximation that of a single domain particle, and mainly controlled by the total\nmagnetic anisotropy. The magnetic anisotropy contains contributions from various sources,\nbut for such small devices the contributions from the shape anisotropy and from the crystalline (i.e. material) anisotropy dominate. For a given magnetic material, the former can\nbe controlled to a good degree by the aspect ratio and the thickness of the magnetic cells,\nwhile the latter depends on the actual microscopic structure. Typically magnetic films are\npolycrystalline with grain sizes of the order of a few nm to a few 10nm. The grains are\noriented randomly. Since the preferred directions of the crystalline anisotropy are defined\nby the crystal axes, this leads to locally varying anisotropy contributions. Depending on the\nrelative strength of shape anisotropy and crystalline anisotropy, one may therefore expect\na more or less pronounced random component in the switching field. It is the purpose of\nthis paper to assess quantitatively how much fluctuation one may expect depending on the\nvarious parameters in the problem.\nA lot of work in material science has been done over many years to examine how magnetic\nparameters are influenced by the composition and micro structure of thin films1\u20139 .Models\nof disordered ferromagnets were studied analytically by Ignatchenko and co\u2013workers in the\nlate 1970s and early 1980s (see10 and references therein) as well as by Kronm\u00fcller and co\u2013\nworkers12 . They derived \"laws of approach of the magnetization to saturation\". Such laws\nwere used as early as 1931 for the characterization of materials13 . The laws derived by\nIgnatchenko et al. allowed to extract quantitative information about the correlations of local magnetic anisotropy11 . The focus of these works was, however, on average macroscopic\ncharacteristics, like coercive fields or remanent magnetizations, and not on fluctuation of\nswitching fields in small magnetic elements. Ref.14 deals with the latter problem by mi2\n\n\fcromagnetic simulations, but without a simple model presented the physical insight and\npredictive power of this analysis is limited. Also in the context of recording media, granular\nmaterials were extensively simulated15 . Experimentally it is very difficult to distinguish the\ncontributions of different origins to fluctuations in switching fields. In particular, fluctuations\nin the shapes of magnetic cells may easily mask fluctuations arising from the material.\nIn the following I will introduce a disordered Stoner Wohlfarth model, a simple model\nthat allows to address the question of disorder induced fluctuations of the switching fields\nanalytically. I will show that within this model the joint probability distribution P (K, \u03b3)\nfor the total anisotropy strength K and the overall preferred direction \u03b3 is controlled by a\nsingle dimensionless parameter \u03bd. If we denote by K1 the uniaxial shape anisotropy, by Kcr\nthe crystalline (i.e. bulk single crystal) anisotropy, by N the typical number of crystallites in\nthe sample, and by \u03b1 a number of order unity that depends on the shape of the crystallites,\nthe parameter \u03bd is given by\n\u03bd=\n\nN\n\u03b1\n\n\u0012\n\nK1\nKcr\n\n\u00132\n\n.\n\n(1)\n\n\u221a\nThe fluctuations of the switching field decay like 1/ \u03bd for large \u03bd. All of this will be derived\nin Sec.II. Sec.III is devoted to numerical verification by micromagnetic modeling, and Sec.IV\ncontains the conclusions.\n\nII. THE DISORDERED STONER WOHLFARTH MODEL\n\nSuppose the magnetic cell consists of N crystallites, with respective volumes Vl , easy axis\ndirection \u03b3l (l = 1, . . . , N) and crystalline anisotropy Kcr . For the moment let us consider\nthe simplest case in which each crystallite gives rise to a uniaxial anisotropy. Further assume\nthat the magnetization M is uniform across the sample, with components uniquely specified\nby the angle \u03b8, Mx = Ms cos \u03b8, My = Ms sin \u03b8, where Ms is the saturation magnetization.\nThis approximation works well for sub-\u03bcm sized magnetic cells, which are too small to hold\ndomain walls. In an external magnetic field in the cell plane, H = (Hx , Hy ), the total energy\ndensity then reads\n3\n\n\fE/V = K1 sin2 \u03b8 + Kcr\n\nN\nX\nl=1\n\nvl sin2 (\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b3l ) \u2212 Hx Ms cos \u03b8 \u2212 Hy Ms sin \u03b8 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere vl = Vl /V are the volume fractions of the crystallites (V denotes the total volume\nof the magnetic cell). Note that the forms of the crystallites do not enter at this point.\nThe first and the last two terms on the right hand side correspond to the ordinary Stoner\nWohlfarth model16 .\nIn order to figure out the total anisotropy resulting from eq.(2) we need to understand\nhow the different anisotropy terms add up. Let us start by looking at just two uniaxial\nanisotropies K1 and K2 with preferred angles \u03b31 = 0 and \u03b32 . The energy density is then\ngiven by\nE(\u03b8)/V = K1 sin2 \u03b8 + K2 sin2 (\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b32 ) .\n\n(3)\n\nE(\u03b8)/V = \u01eb + K sin2 (\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b3) ,\n\n(4)\n\nWe can rewrite this as\n\nwhere \u01eb is a constant independent of \u03b8, and K and \u03b3 are the new anisotropy strength and\npreferred direction, respectively. By expanding the sin2 terms in both eqs.(3) and (4) one\neasily convinces oneself that the three parameters \u01eb, K and \u03b3 are related to K1 , K2 and \u03b32\nby the three equations\nK1 + K2 cos 2\u03b32 = K cos 2\u03b3 ,\n\n(5)\n\nK2 sin 2\u03b32 = K sin 2\u03b3 ,\n\n(6)\n\nK2 sin2 \u03b32 = K sin2 \u03b3 + \u01eb .\n\n(7)\n\nI will use the convention that all anisotropy constants are positive (0 \u2264 K1 , K2 , K \u2264 \u221e) and\nall uniaxial preference angles are counted in the interval \u2212\u03c0/2 \u2264 \u03b32 , \u03b3 < \u03c0/2. The system\nof equations is then solved uniquely for all K1 , K2 , and \u03b32 by\nK1 + K2 cos 2\u03b32\n1\n\u03b3 = sign(\u03b32 ) arccos\n2\nK\nq\n\u0012\n\nK=\n\nK12 + K22 + 2K1 K2 cos 2\u03b32 ,\n4\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(8)\n(9)\n\n\fand a third equation determining \u01eb, which is, however, irrelevant for the following. Note\nthat the arccos function returns a value in the interval 0 . . . \u03c0, which by the prefactor 1/2 is remapped to the interval 0 . . . \u03c0/2.\n\nSince \u03b31 was chosen as zero, the sec-\n\nond angle determines the sign of the angle of the overall preferred direction.\n\nFig.1\n\nshows how the overall angle depends on \u03b32 for various values of the ratio r = K2 /K1 .\nFIGURES\n\n1.5\n\n\u03b3\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n\u03b32\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\nFIG. 1. Resulting angle from adding two uniaxial anisotropies (eq.8). For r = K2 /K1 < 1, the\nmaximum angle reached is smaller than \u03c0/4. Only if K2 dominates (r > 1), the angle \u03c0/2 can be reached.\nThe values of r chosen are 0.1 (the curve with the smallest slope at \u03b32 = 0), 0.5, 0.7, 1.0 (a straight line\nwith slope 1/2), 1.5, 2.0, 5.0, and 10.0 (almost a straight line with slope 1.0). Only the first quadrant is\nshown, as \u03b3 is an odd function of \u03b32 .\n\nFor K2 /K1 < 1 the maximum angle reachable for the new overall preferred direction is\nsmaller than \u03c0/4 - the K1 term always dominates and keeps the preferred direction close\nto zero. For K1 = K2 , an overall angle \u03c0/4 can be reached at \u03b32 = \u03c0/2, but eq.(9) shows\nthat then the overall strength K goes to zero: With two orthogonal preferred axes with\nanisotropy of equal strength, the total anisotropy vanishes indeed. For K2 > K1 , the overall\n\n5\n\n\fpreferred angle is dominated by the second anisotropy and therefore angles beyond \u03c0/4 can\nbe reached.\nConcerning the total strength of the anisotropy, eq.(9) tells us that K is obtained similarly\nas if two vectors with lengths and directions K1 , K2 and directions 0, \u03b32 were added - with\nthe only difference that the angle between the two vectors has to be replaced by twice\nits value in the rule for standard vector addition. Thus, the non\u2013linear addition of uniaxial\nanisotropy terms is, for what concerns the resulting anisotropy strength, replaced by a linear\nvector addition, where the length of the vectors is given by the strengths of the anisotropy,\nand their enclosed angle is twice the angle between the original preferred directions.\nComing back to the disordered Stoner\u2013Wohlfarth model, eq.(2), we now understand\nthat the sum of anisotropy energies with random strength and preferred directions, i.e. the\nintrinsic anisotropy Ki = Kcr\n\nPN\n\nl=1\n\nvl sin2 (\u03b8 \u2212\u03b3l ), corresponds to a random walk in the plane:\n\nFor the vector addition the relative angles are uniformly distributed in the interval [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0[,\nand the length of step l is the random term Kcr vl . The unusual addition (8) of angles not\nwithstanding, the resulting final orientation of the vector in the random walk is distributed\nuniformly over [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0[, for all Ki since each single angle is. The random walk leads to a\ndistribution of Ki that is for N \u226b 1 well approximated by a Gaussian centered at Ki = 0\n2\nand with a variance \u03c3 2 = hKi2 i = NKcr\nhvi2 i. If we assume that the typical volume fraction\n\u221a\n\u221a\nis given by a typical crystallite dimension al as hvl2 i1/2 = \u03b1ha2l i/L2 = \u03b1/N, where \u03b1 is a\n\nnumerical prefactor depending on the distribution of crystallite areas (and thus on the shape\n\u221a\n\u221a\nof the crystallites) we obtain the scaling behavior \u03c3 = \u03b1Kcr / N, and the joint probability\ndistribution P (Ki , \u03b3i ) of the intrinsic anisotropy and the preferred direction,\n\u221a\n!\n2\nKi2 1\nPi (Ki , \u03b3i ) = \u221a exp \u2212 2\n\u03c0\u03c3\n2\u03c3 \u03c0\n\n(10)\n\nfor \u2212\u03c0/2 \u2264 \u03b3i < \u03c0/2 and 0 \u2264 Ki \u2264 \u221e.\nIn order to determine the distribution of the total anisotropy, it is most convenient to\nstart with an expression for the joint distribution of K 2 and the total preferred angle \u03b3,\nemploying once more the law for adding uniaxial anisotropies, eqs.(8) and (9). We have\n6\n\n\fs\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\n\u0011\ndKi \u03c0/2 d\u03b3i \u0010 2\nP (K , \u03b3) =\n\u03b4 Ki + 2K1 Ki cos 2\u03b3i + K12 \u2212 K 2\n\u03c3 \u2212\u03c0/2 \u03c0\n0\n\u0013\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0010\n\u0011\nK1 + Ki cos 2\u03b3i\n1\nexp \u2212Ki2 /(2\u03c3 2 ) .\n\u00d7\u03b4 \u03b3 \u2212 sign(\u03b3i ) arccos\n2\nK\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nZ\n\n(11)\n\nThe two integrals are easily performed. We can then transform the distribution back to\nP (K, \u03b3), express K with a dimensionless parameter k as K = kK1 , and thus arrive at the\nfinal form\n1\nP (K, \u03b3) =\nK1\n\ns\n\n2\n\n2\u03bd e\u2212(k +1\u22122k cos 2\u03b3)\u03bd/2\nk\u221a 2\n\u03c03\nk + 1 \u2212 2k cos 2\u03b3\n\n(12)\n\nwith the dimensionless parameter \u03bd defined previously in eq.(1). As is now obvious, the\ntotal distribution of anisotropies is uniquely specified by this parameter \u03bd, and so are all\nstatistical properties of the switching fields.\nThe distribution is centered around k = 1 and \u03b3 = 0, and in fact diverges for these values\nfor all parameters \u03bd. Typical values of \u03bd for magnetic cells may vary over a large range. A\nrectangular 800x400x5 nm3 Permalloy cell leads to a shape anisotropy K1 = 44.4*103 erg/cm3 .\nAssuming a crystalline anisotropy Kcr = 1000 erg/cm3 and a typical crystallite size of 20nm,\nwe have \u03bd = 1.58 * 106 . Larger crystallites (say ha2i i1/2 = 50nm), a smaller aspect ratio, and\nthinner films may reduce this value. A rectangular 500x400x3 nm3 cell has \u03bd = 10.2 * 103 .\nThe distribution P (K, \u03b3) is most relevant for rotational remanence experiments on arrays\nof nominally identical magnetic cells17 . In these experiments a strong magnetic field is\napplied at an angle \u03b2 relative to the nominal easy axis of the cells (as defined by shape\nanisotropy). Then the magnetic field is switched off, with the direction of the field preserved\nuntil zero field is reached, and one measures the remanent magnetization along the nominal\neasy axis as function of the angle \u03b2. In the strong magnetic fields (i.e. field values outside\nall astroids of the cells), a cell will always align to good approximation to the field. But\nwhen the field is switched off, cells that saw a positive field component along their actual\neasy axis will remain in a state magnetized along their positive actual easy axis, while those\nwhich saw a negative field component relative to their actual easy axis will fall into a state\nmagnetized along their negative actual easy axis. Thus, all that matters is the distribution\n7\n\n\fof preferred angles \u03b3, but not the strength of the anisotropy. Let us call \"x\u2013axis\"the nominal\neasy direction, Mc the average total magnetic moment of a single cell along the x\u2013axis at\nzero field, and n the number of cells in the array. If all cells had \u03b3 = 0 there would be a\nsharp jump of the total Mx of the array at \u03b2 = \u03c0/2 from Mx = nMc to Mx = \u2212nMc , if \u03b2 is\ncranked up from zero to \u03c0. A finite width of the distribution of \u03b3 is reflected directly in the\nwidth of the transition. Integrating out K in (12) we find the distribution of the preferred\nangles alone. Fig.2 shows the result obtained from numerically integrating\nP (\u03b3) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\ndKP (K, \u03b3) .\n\n(13)\n\nNote the rather non\u2013Gaussian profiles, in particular the pronounced cusps at zero angle,\neven for very small values of \u03bd where the distribution is almost homogeneous over the entire\nangle interval \u2212\u03c0/2 . . . \u03c0/2.\n0\n\n10\n\n5.0\n\n4.0\n\nP(\u03b3)\n\n\u03c3(P(\u03b3))\n\n3.0\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n2.0\n\n1.0\n\u22122\n\n0.0\n\u22121.5\n\n10\n\u22121.0\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0.0\n\n\u03b3\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n\u03bd\n\nFIG. 2.

Right: Scaling of the\nwidth of the distribution P (\u03b3) with the parameter \u03bd.\n\n\u221a\nThe standard deviation of the distribution scales as 1/ \u03bd, as is shown in Fig.2. For\ncomparison with actual experiments it is useful to note, however, that the cells in an array\nare typically not identical, even concerning their geometry. Fluctuations in the shape due\nto lithography errors and etch processes will lead to additional fluctuations in K1 that can\n8\n\n\fmask fluctuations due to the intrinsic material anisotropy.\n\nA. Switching field fluctuations\n\nLet us now have a look at the consequences for the distribution of switching fields. As\nis well known, the energy density (2) without the fluctuating term (Kcr = 0) leads to a\nstability region in the (Hx , Hy ) plane given by the astroid16\nMs Hx (\u03b8)\n= \u2212 cos3 \u03b8 ,\n2K1\nMs Hy (\u03b8)\n= sin3 \u03b8 .\nhy,0 (\u03b8) \u2261\n2K1\n\nhx,0 (\u03b8) \u2261\n\n(14)\n(15)\n\nThe two equations are obtained by setting simultaneously \u2202\u03b8 E(\u03b8)/V = 0 and \u2202\u03b82 E(\u03b8)/V = 0,\nwhich leads to the field combinations (Hx (\u03b8), Hy (\u03b8)) where the nature of equilibrium points\nchanges from stable to unstable (or from unstable to stable). A magnetic cell in a stable\nstate with Mx < 0 switches to a state Mx > 0 if a field combination is applied that lies\noutside of the boundary (14), (15) in the positive half plane hx > 0 (and correspondingly\nfor Mx < 0).\nIncluding the random crystalline contributions in eq.(2) we now have\nE(\u03b8)/V = K sin2 (\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b3) \u2212 Ms Hx cos \u03b8 \u2212 Ms Hy sin \u03b8\n\n(16)\n\nfor the total energy density for a given cell (up to the irrelevant global shift \u01eb), where K and\n\u03b3 are distributed according to (12). Since the easy axis direction defines the orientation of\nthe coordinate frame relative to which the Stoner\u2013Wohlfarth astroid is measured, it is clear\neven without calculation that the energy density (16) leads for each K and \u03b3 again to an\nideal astroid that is rotated by the angle \u03b3 and changed in size by a factor K/K1 (if magnetic\nfields are still measured in units of 2K1 /Ms , the normalization used in eqs.(14,15)). In the\nexplicit form of the stability boundary derived again from \u2202\u03b8 E(\u03b8) = 0 = \u2202\u03b82 E(\u03b8),\nK\nMs Hx (\u03b8)\n=\u2212\n(cos(3\u03b8 \u2212 2\u03b3) + 3 cos(\u03b8 \u2212 2\u03b3)) ,\n2K1\n4K1\nK\nMs Hy (\u03b8)\n=\n(\u2212 sin(3\u03b8 \u2212 2\u03b3) + 3 sin(\u03b8 \u2212 2\u03b3)) ,\nhy (\u03b8) =\n2K1\n4K1\n\nhx (\u03b8) =\n\n9\n\n(17)\n(18)\n\n\fthe rotation of the astroid is somewhat obscured by the fact that \u03b8 is not the polar angle\nof the astroid, but just a parameter in a parametric representation. One easily convinces\noneself, though, that acting on (hx,0 , hy,0 ) with a rotation matrix corresponding to an angle\n\u03b3 and with an overall factor K/K1 reproduces (17),(18).\nEqs.(17) and (18) can be used together with (12) to calculate an average astroid as well\nas fluctuations around it. It turns out, however, that for this purpose it is more convenient\nto go back one step in the calculation and keep the total intrinsic anisotropy Ki separate\nfrom the deterministic anisotropy K1 , since Ki is simply Gaussian distributed, eq.(10). This\nwill prove useful in Sec.II B as well, where we will look at the combination of random cubic\ncrystalline anisotropy with uniaxial shape anisotropy. The latter situation will not even\nallow for defining an overall anisotropy with a single anisotropy constant. Let us therefore\nstart from an energy density\nE(\u03b8)/V = K1 sin2 \u03b8 + Ki sin2 (\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b3i ) \u2212 Ms Hx cos \u03b8 \u2212 Ms Hy sin \u03b8\n\n(19)\n\nwith Ki , \u03b3i distributed according to (10). If we express Ki in units of K1 , Ki = ki K1 , we\narrive at\nki\nMs Hx (\u03b8)\n= \u2212 (cos(3\u03b8 \u2212 2\u03b3i ) + 3 cos(\u03b8 \u2212 2\u03b3i )) \u2212 cos3 \u03b8 ,\n2K1\n4\nMs Hy (\u03b8)\nki\nhy (\u03b8) =\n= \u2212 (sin(3\u03b8 \u2212 2\u03b3i ) \u2212 3 sin(\u03b8 \u2212 2\u03b3i )) + sin3 \u03b8 .\n2K1\n4\n\nhx (\u03b8) =\n\n(20)\n(21)\n\nBefore presenting the results for the mean values and fluctuations of the switching fields, let\nme note that depending on the measurement performed different ways of averaging might\nbe relevant. If we are interested in the fluctuation of the switching field for a given direction\nof the applied field and if the fluctuations are small, i.e. \u03bd \u226b 1, the fluctuations for a fixed\nparameter \u03b8 are relevant. The parameter \u03b8 will be given to good approximation for all\nastroids by the unperturbed astroid (14), (15),\nHy\n\u03b8 = arctan\nHx\n\u0012\n\n\u00131/3\n\n.\n\n(22)\n\nHowever, when the fluctuations are larger, or if we are interested in swept astroids where Hy\nis kept fixed and Hx is swept, so that by definition all fluctuations are in Hx , the situation\n10\n\n\fis much more complex. One will then have to calculate the relevant \u03b8 for each realization of\nthe disorder separately. This will be discussed elsewhere20 .\nHere I will assume that the disorder induced fluctuations are small and that the point\non the astroid where we are interested in the variation of the switching fields is sufficiently\nwell described by \u03b8 as obtained from eq.(22). Since ki enters only linearly in (20), (21) and\nis distributed Gaussian, and since \u03b3i is distributed uniformly over the interval \u2212\u03c0/2 . . . \u03c0/2,\nwe find immediately that the average astroid is the ideal astroid given in eqs.(14),(15). The\nstandard deviation of the switching field in units of Hc = 2K1 /Ms is given by\n\u03c3Hx,Hy =\n\nHc 1 \u221a\n\u221a 5 \u00b1 3 cos 2\u03b8,\n4 \u03bd\n\n(23)\n\nwhere \u03c3Hx comes with the positive sign under the square root, \u03c3Hy with the negative. Thus,\n\u221a\nthe fluctuations in the switching field scale like 1/ \u03bd. For soft magnetic materials like\npermalloy and magnetic cells with aspect ratios not too close to unity, K1 is dominated by\nshape anisotropy, which in turn is proportional to the aspect ratio over a wide range. We\nconclude that the \"array quality factor\"18 Hc /\u03c3Hx for fixed cell width should be proportional\nto the aspect ratio of the cells to the power 3/2.\n\nB. Cubic Crystalline Anisotropy\n\nA material with cubic anisotropy has an energy density that depends on the direction\ncosines \u03b1x , \u03b1y and \u03b1z of the magnetization with the crystal axes according to\nE/V = C(\u03b1x2 \u03b1y2 + \u03b1x2 \u03b1z2 + \u03b1y2 \u03b1z2 ) ,\n\n(24)\n\nwhere C is the lowest order cubic anisotropy constant19 . I will assume in the following that\nthe crystallites all have a z\u2013axis perpendicular to the film, i.e. the films are supposed to\nbe well ordered in z\u2013direction. This is a natural assumption for flat crystallites with lateral\ndimensions of a few 10nm and films only a few nm thick, even though uniform distributions\nof the crystal axis on cones have been observed in 50nm thick films9 . Furthermore, if the\n11\n\n\fmagnetization is effectively restricted to the plane of the film (for sufficiently thin films this\nis always the case), we have \u03b1z = 0. I parameterize the magnetization in the plane again\nby an angle \u03b8 with respect to the x\u2013axis. We then have \u03b1x = cos \u03b8, \u03b1y = sin \u03b8, and the\nexpression reduces to\nE/V =\n\nC\nsin2 2\u03b8 .\n4\n\n(25)\n\nCubic anisotropy projected to a (001) crystal plane thus leads to a four\u2013fold (or bi\u2013axial)\nsymmetry in that plane. And instead of the four\u2013fold jagged astroid for purely uniaxial\nmaterials, the stability curve is now eight\u2013fold jagged. Note that the shape anisotropy of\nthe cells is still uniaxial, though. The disordered Stoner Wohlfarth model for materials with\nthe projected cubic crystalline anisotropy thus reads\nN\nCX\nE/V = K1 sin \u03b8 +\nvi sin2 (2(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b3i )) \u2212 Hx Ms cos \u03b8 \u2212 Hy Ms sin \u03b8 ,\n4 i=1\n2\n\n(26)\n\nwhere I assume again that the orientations \u03b3i of the crystallites are distributed uniformly\nover the entire relevant interval, i.e. \u2212\u03c0/4 \u2264 \u03b3i < \u03c0/4. For adding only cubic anisotropies\nthe same rules (8), (9) apply as were derived from adding uniaxial anisotropies. Indeed, in\nthe derivation we can just replace \u03b8 \u2192 2\u03b8, and replace K1 , K2 by two corresponding cubic\nanisotropy constants C1 and C2 , and everything else goes through as before. The same is\ntrue for the random walk picture. Thus, many cubic anisotropy terms added up lead again\nto a cubic anisotropy with a distribution of the overall Ci and \u03b3 given by 2Pi (Ci , \u03b3), see\neq. (10). The prefactor two is due to the fact that \u03b3 now covers only half the previous\ninterval. Things are different, however, when we combine the total cubic anisotropy with\nthe uniaxial shape anisotropy. Obviously, the result will neither be a pure cubic anisotropy\nnor a pure uniaxial anisotropy, but rather a sum of two such terms. The boundary of the\nstability region derived from \u2202\u03b8 E(\u03b8) = 0 = \u2202\u03b82 E(\u03b8), with\nE(\u03b8)/V = K1 sin2 \u03b8 +\n\nCi\nsin2 (2(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b3i )) \u2212 Ms Hx cos \u03b8 \u2212 Ms Hy sin \u03b8\n4\n\nnow reads\n12\n\n(27)\n\n\fci\nMs Hx (\u03b8)\n= (5 cos(3\u03b8 \u2212 4\u03b3i ) + 3 cos(5\u03b8 \u2212 4\u03b3i )) \u2212 cos3 \u03b8 ,\n2K1\n8\nci\nMs Hy (\u03b8)\n= (5 sin(3\u03b8 \u2212 4\u03b3i ) \u2212 3 sin(5\u03b8 \u2212 4\u03b3i )) + sin3 \u03b8 .\nhy (\u03b8) =\n2K1\n8\n\nhx (\u03b8) = \u2212\n\n(28)\n(29)\n\nDepending on the relative strength ci = Ci /K1 and orientation of the total cubic intrinsic anisotropy, this boundary may be rather different from the ideal Stoner\u2013\nWohlfarth astroid, as for example depicted in Fig.3.\n\nDepending on the parameters,\n\nlittle twists arise that might not always be resolvable in experiments, and give the\nimpression of astroids broadened in one direction, or of kinks in the astroid sides.\n\n1.5\n1.0\n\nhy\n\n0.5\n0.0\n-0.5\n-1.0\n-1.5\n-1.5\n\n-1.0\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\nhx\nFIG. 3.

NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS\n\nI performed micromagnetic simulations for many different cell types, varying cell size,\naspect ratio, thickness, and material properties. A commercially available simulation package was used that allows to mimic a poly\u2013crystalline structure with an adjustable average\nsize of the crystallites. Each crystallite is then assigned a random preferred direction. Typically, 10 to 100 different disorder realizations were used for each type of cell simulated,\nand average value and standard deviation of the switching fields in easy direction (actually under a small angle of 4 degrees with respect to the easy axis in order to avoid the\nnumerical problems related to catastrophic switching) were calculated. Fig.4 shows a cumulative plot for all samples with uniaxial or cubic crystalline anisotropy of the standard\ndeviation of the switching field (in units of K1 ) as function of the parameter \u03bd.1 For the\ncalculation of \u03bd, the numerically determined average value of K1 was used, related to the\nswitching field by Hc = 2K1 /Ms . For both types of crystalline anisotropy the decay of the\n\u221a\nfluctuations like 1/ \u03bd is well observed over almost five orders of magnitude. For very large\n\u03bd the fluctuations seem to decay slightly slower, but they might be limited by the finite\nfield resolution, as well as the intrinsic fluctuations of the simulation program. Ideally one\nwould expect all curves to collapse on a single one. The simulations show that the numerical constant \u03b1 in the definition of \u03bd does depend somewhat on the nominal sample properties.\n\n1 Note\n\nthat a negative anisotropy constant corresponds to a preferred axis rotated by 90 degrees.\n\nAs the crystallite axes are uniformly distributed over the full \u03c0 interval, P (K, \u03b3) should not depend\non the sign of Kcr . This was checked numerically by using some samples with negative Kcr .\n\n14\n\n\f\u22121\n\n\u03c3(Hc)/<Hc>\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n4\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n7\n\n10\n\n\u03bd\nFIG. 4.

Within a Stoner\u2013Wohlfarth model with random anisotropy contributions I have derived the joint\u2013probability distribution of the overall anisotropy strength\nand direction. The form of the distribution implies a dependence of the switching field\n\u221a\nfluctuations on a single parameter \u03bd, see eq.(1), in the form of a 1/ \u03bd behavior. Also, the\n\u221a\nwidth of the transition in rotational remanence experiments should scale as 1/ \u03bd, and a\n15\n\n\fbroadening of the transition due to crystalline disorder should lead to a rather remarkable\nline shape. Micromagnetic simulations confirmed the scaling with \u03bd both for uniaxial and\ncubic crystalline anisotropy.\nAcknowledgements: It is my pleasure to thank David Abraham, Snorri Ingvarsson, Roger\nKoch, Yu Lu, John Slonczezwski, Solomon Woods and Philip Trouilloud for stimulating\ndiscussions.
