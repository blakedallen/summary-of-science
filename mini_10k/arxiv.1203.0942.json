We also study the dependence of the background rates on technology parameters like\nthickness of the active layer and detection threshold.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) [1] is one of the proposals for an electron-positron\ncollider to explore the energy frontier. The conceptual design develops an e+ e- collider with\ntwo main linacs of 21.02km, where electrons and positrons will be accelerated at 100MV/m\nto produce collisions with a nominal center-of-mass energy of 3TeV.\nThe detector concepts ILD (International Large Detector) [2] and SiD (Silicon Detector) [3],\noriginally designed for the ILC, form the starting point for the design of the CLIC detectors.\nFor the CLIC CDR [4] the ILD and SiD design were adapted to cope with the much larger\ncenter-of-mass energy and the extremely short bunch spacing. Early studies of machine\nbackgrounds in the ILD concept [5] show that at a center-of-mass energy of 3 TeV the hit\ndensity due to beam-induced background is significantly higher than at the ILC. We reassess\nthe background levels at CLIC. The tracking systems that are most strongly affected are those\nsituated at small distance to the interaction point, and the innermost radii of the forward\ntracking system. We therefore redesign the barrel VXD (Vertex Detector) and the FTD\n(Forward Tracking Disks) to keep manageable background levels in all systems.\nThe background studies assume generic solid-state detectors. Candidate detector technologies\nfor the vertex detector and tracking disks show strong variations in a number of parameters\nthat can have a strong impact on the background hit density. We consider two parameters. The\nthickness of the active layer has a strong impact on the background hit density, as particles\nfrequently impinge on the detectors under a very shallow angle. The active thickness varies\nfrom as little as 500 nm in Geiger-mode devices [6] to 200-300 \uf06dm in mainstream hybrid\n\nLCWS11\n\n\fpixel detector technology employed in the LHC experiments. The second parameter, the\ndetection threshold, is typically related to the former. Geiger-mode devices are sensitive to\nsingle electrons, while hybrid pixel technologies are insensitive to ionization signal below\nseveral hundreds of charge carriers. Therefore these characteristics could lead to important\nvariations in the background hit density.\nIn Section 2 of this contribution we present the layout of the VXD and FTD in the CLIC\ndetector concepts and discuss the resulting background levels. The impact on these results of\ntypical pixel detector technology choices is studied in Section 3.\n\n2\n\nFTD & VXD new layout\n\nEarly studies show that the contribution of incoherent pair production to the hit density in the\ntracking elements at low radius at CLIC is significantly increased with respect to the ILC [4].\nThe production of hadrons due to photon-photon fusion (\uf067\uf067\uf0aehadrons) is moreover found to\ncontribute much more significantly at CLIC [7]. The charged particles from this process tend\nto be emitted in the forward region. Pair background produces very soft particles that do not\nreach large radii in the strong magnetic field of the tracking volume. The momentum\nspectrum of charged particles due to \uf067\uf067\uf0aehadrons is much harder and this process is the\ndominant source of background at large radius.\nThe primary handle on the background hit density due to the dominant pair production\nprocess is the inner radius of the vertex detector and the innermost tracking disks. To obtain\nthe same levels of background as in the ILC experiments, it has to be increased significantly.\n\nFigure 1: The dependence of the transverse impact parameter resolution on the\ninner radius of the vertex detector barrel, that is varied from 25 to 37 mm (the ILC\ndetector concepts have inner radii of ~15 mm).\nA change in this parameter has an impact on the precision of the extrapolation of charged\nLCWS11\n\n\fparticle tracks to the interaction point. The impact parameter resolution versus inner radius of\nthe barrel vertex detector is shown in Figure 1.\nThe impact parameter resolution is usually expressed as a squared sum of a constant term a\nthat depends on the single-point resolution of the detector and a \"material\" or \"multiple\nscattering\" term b that depends on the momentum and polar angle of the charged particle.\n\n\ue08d\n\n2\n\n\u03c3 R\u03a6 = a \ue083\n\nb2 GeV 2 sin 3 \u03b8\np2T\n\n(1)\n\nThe constant term a is quite insensitive to the inner radius; the impact parameter resolution for\nhigh momentum tracks varies from 1.4 to 1.5 \u03bcm, well below the goal of a\u22485 \u03bcm, for the radii\nconsidered here. The \"material\" term does show a significant dependence on the inner radius,\nas shown by the variation in the resolution for particles with p = 1 GeV, that is dominated by\nthis term.\nFTD and Beam Pipe was redesign to reduce background levels. The conical section of the\nbeam pipe was made thick, to reduce backscatters. The conical part of the beam pipe was\nmoved outside the tracking acceptance, making it pointing to the IP and one disk layer was\nadded to reduce the lever arm for the track extrapolation.\nIn the new layout of the VXD and FTD shown in Figure 2, the innermost layer of the barrel\nvertex detector is placed at 31mm from the impact point, to yield a background hit density per\nreadout cycle that is comparable to the ILC [8]. Of several layout variants a detector design\nwith 3 double layers was chosen. As a consequence, the specification on the \"material\" term b\nof the impact parameter resolution is relaxed to 15 \u03bcm.\nThis modification of the barrel vertex detector design has an impact on FTD as well. To keep\ngood polar angle coverage and provide a first measurement point as close as possible to the\ninteraction point, three double-layer disks are located close to the end of the barrel vertex\ndetector. The CLIC detector thus has 11 disks covering from 6.6 to 32.5 degrees, compared to\n7 disks covering 5 to 36 degrees in the [5] ILD concept at the ILC. This more powerful\nforward tracking system helps cope with the increased importance of the forward region in a\nmulti-TeV collider [9].\n\nFigure 2: Sketch of tracking detectors in CLIC_ILD.\n\nLCWS11\n\n\fWith the adapted geometry we proceed to determine the background hit density. A map on\nthe r-z plane of the background levels of the detector elements in the innermost part of the\ntracking volume is shown in Figure 3. Results were obtained with 50\u03bcm thickness for the\npixel sensors with a threshold of 3.4keV and 275\u03bcm thickness for the strip sensors with\nthreshold of 17keV\n\nFigure 3: Average hit density in the tracking detectors from incoherent electron positron\npairs and \u03b3\u03b3\uf0aehadrons.\nThe contributions from incoherent pair production and \uf067\uf067\uf0aehadrons are added. The former\nclearly dominates the hit density in the innermost layers, while the contributions are\ncomparable for the largest radii considered here.\nNo safety factor is applied to account for the uncertainty in the rate. In the CLIC CDR a\nsafety factor of five is considered for the contribution from pair production and of two for the\none from \u03b3\u03b3\uf0aehadrons. Hits are counted as GEANT4 energy deposits and the number of\npixels with a signal above threshold in the cluster created by each particle is not accounted\nfor. The next Section addresses the dependence of the result on a specific technology choice,\nthat must be taken into account to reach a more realistic estimate.\n\n3\n\nTechnology Dependence\n\nMost background studies consider a generic solid state vertex detector technology, with a\nsensitive detector thickness (50 \uf06dm) and threshold (any particle producing an energy deposit\nis counted) that are considered to be typical of the candidate detector technologies. In the\npresent technologies a rather broad range is found for energy threshold can be from singleelectron detection to thresholds of 400e, while the thickness of the active volume lies between\n1\u03bcm and 200\u03bcm. These differences lead to different hit density in the detector. A reduction of\nLCWS11\n\n\fthe sensitive thickness leads to much smaller clusters for inclined tracks. The technologies\nwith the thinnest sensitive layer must have a low detection threshold because of the reduction\nof the energy deposition by Minimum Ionizing Particles (for Silicon, on average,\napproximately 80 electron-hole pairs are created for each micron the charged particle travels\nthrough the sensitive material). In this section we investigate how the hit density depends on\nthese parameters.\nDetectors with single-electron sensitivity are expected to detect also very small energy\ndeposits from photons, for instance due to Compton scattering. Thus, such technologies could\nbe very sensitive to the CLIC photon background. We therefore study the hit density due to\nphotons in more detail.\nThese studies were done using GEANT4 [10] based full detector simulation in MOKKA [11]\nand Marlin [12], with CLIC_ILD model using QGSP_BERT_HP and QGSP_BIC physics list.\nThe pair background corresponding to one bunch crossing was used with range-cut equal to\n5\u03bcm. The default cut in Mokka on the energy of particles (the TPC-cut) is set to 0 eV. Hits\ndue to photons were required to release at least 3.6eV, the minimum energy necessary to\ngenerate an electron-hole pair in silicon [13].\nFig. 4 shows the photon spectrum in the FTD. This includes photons traversing the detector\nwithout leaving any energy deposit. An important spectrum above 10keV is populated by\nphotons that come directly from the beam and hit the detector within 1 ns after the bunch\ncrossing. The soft spectrum, below 10eV, corresponds to photons reflected from the very\nforward calorimeter. This last source is not important, as the energy deposits are too small to\nbe detected in Silicon.\n\nFigure 4. Leftmost panel: Spectrum of hits of photons with any deposited energy in the\ntracking layers, including null deposition. Rightmost panel: Number of Compton events\nexpected per primary track in 50\u03bcm of silicon plus 8\u03bcm of SiO2.\nOur simulation shows that only approximately one per mil of the hits in the FTD is due to\nphotons, even for the lowest detection threshold considered here. This can be understood\nconsidering the Compton cross-section in Fig. 4. The probability that a photon deposits\nLCWS11\n\n\fenergy in a thin Silicon layer is quite substantial for photons in the keV range. However, For\nphoton energies of approximately 1 MeV, where an important population exists, the Compton\ncross-section is negligible.\nTo study the effect on the hit density and cluster size of detector thickness and detection\nthreshold, the disks of the FTD were divided in 25\u03bcm x 25\u03bcm areas. Detailed information was\nretrieved from GEANT4, so multiple energy deposits in small steps, along the tracks inside\nthe disks, were projected on the pixel grid, and pixels with energy depositions above threshold\nwere counted as \"hit\" pixels.\nFor technologies with very thin layers the cluster size for inclined tracks is significantly\nreduced. On the other hand, technologies with low threshold are expected to see an increase\nin the number of hits due to low-energy deposits.\n\nFigure 5: Comparative of hit density for different technologies.\nThe net result of the two competing effects is shown in Figure 5, for a number of\nrepresentative combinations of detector thickness and detection threshold. The number of\nparticles leaving a signal in the innermost FTD (the blue bars) remains roughly constant for\nthe three combinations considered here. The smaller detection threshold leads to a negligible\nincrease in the number of hits.\nThe number of \"hit\" pixels, however, increases strongly with increasing thickness of the\nsensitive layer. Charge sharing due to inclined tracks in devices with relatively thick active\nlayers (in relation to the small pixel size) can thus lead to a significant increase in the\noccupancy.\n\nLCWS11\n\n\f4\n\nConclusions\n\nWe present the new layout for the Vertex Detector and Forward Tracking Disks in the CLIC\ndetector concepts. The most significant adaptation to the CLIC environment is the\nmodification of the inner radius of the vertex detector, that is located at 31mm from the\ninteraction point. As a consequence, the specification for the multiple scattering term b of the\ntransverse impact parameter is relaxed to 15\u03bcm. To guarantee robust coverage in the forward\nregion the FTD is equipped with 11 disks, six of which are on double-layer disks as close as\npossible to the barrel vertex detector. We also present the hit density due to machine\nbackground on the innermost tracker elements.\nDifferent vertex detector technologies considered for CLIC span a broad range of detector\nthicknesses and detection thresholds. Simulations taking into account both parameters show\nthat the detection threshold (down to single-electron sensitivity) is of relatively minor\nimportance. In particular, the contribution of photons to the hit density is at the per mil level.\nThe detector thickness, on the other hand, strongly affects the occupancy. As background\nparticles frequently hit the detector under a very shallow angle, the average cluster size grows\napproximately linearly with increasing detector thickness, leading to important differences\nbetween the thinnest and thickest detector technologies on the market.\n\n5\n\nReferences\n\n[1] J.
