We select events with significant missing transverse energy and high jet multiplicity. This measurement vetoes the presence of explicitly identified electrons and muons, thus enhancing the tau contribution of tt\u0304 decays. Signal events\nare discriminated from the background using a neural network, and heavy flavor jets are identified by a secondary-vertex tagging algorithm. We measure a tt\u0304 production cross section of\n7.99 \u00b1 0.55 (stat) \u00b1 0.76 (syst) \u00b1 0.46 (lumi) pb, assuming a top mass mtop = 172.5 GeV/c2 ,\nin agreement with previous measurements and standard model predictions.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\u221a\nIn pp\u0304 collisions at s = 1.96 TeV at the Tevatron,\ntop quarks are produced mainly in pairs through quarkantiquark annihilation and gluon-gluon fusion processes.\nIn the standard model (SM), the calculated cross section\nfor top pair production at the Tevatron center-of-mass\n2\nenergy is 7.46+0.66\n\u22120.80 pb [1] for a top mass of 172.5 GeV/c .\nThis value can be enhanced by new processes beyond the\nSM such as top pair production via new massive resonances [2], while the comparison of the top pair production cross section in different decay channels can be sen-\n\nsitive to the presence of top decays via a charged Higgs\nboson [3]. Thus, a precise measurement of the top pair\nproduction cross section is an important test of the SM.\nBoth CDF and D0 have performed many measurements\nof this quantity in different tt\u0304 final states: the most recent\npublished results, both measured in the decay channel\nwith leptons and jets assuming mtop = 172.5 GeV/c2 ,\nare 7.70 \u00b1 0.52 pb for CDF [4] and 7.78 +0.77\n\u22120.64 pb for\nD0 [5].\nAs the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element\nVtb is close to unity [6, 7] and the top mass mtop is\nlarger than the sum of the W boson and bottom quark (b)\n\n\f4\nmasses, in the SM the t \u2192 W b decay is dominant and\nhas a branching ratio of about 100%. Since the W subsequently decays either to a quark-antiquark pair or to\na lepton-neutrino pair, the resulting top pair production\nfinal states can be classified by the number of energetic\ncharged leptons and the number of jets. When only one\nW decays leptonically, the tt\u0304 event is characterized by\nthe presence of a charged lepton, missing energy due to\nthe undetected neutrino, and four high energy jets, two\nof which originate from b quarks. In this lepton plus\njets channel, one selects events with an energetic electron or muon. For this paper we focus on an inclusive\nhigh-momentum neutrino signature of large missing energy accompanied by jets. By not explicitly requiring\nleptons, our measurement is sensitive to all W leptonic\ndecay modes including \u03c4 decays of W 's: about 40% of the\nsignal sample obtained after the kinematic selection contains events with a \u03c4 lepton in the final state. To ensure\nour measurement is statistically independent from other\nCDF results [8], we veto events with high-momentum\nelectrons or muons as well as multijet events with no leptons (all-hadronic tt\u0304 decays). This choice is expected to\nimprove the final CDF combined cross section value: the\nprevious 311 pb\u22121 result [9] carried a weight of about\n17% in the combination [10].\nOne of the major challenges of this measurement is the\nlarge background from QCD multijet processes and electroweak production of W bosons associated with b and\nc jets (heavy flavor jets), which dominates the signal by\ntwo orders of magnitude before any selection. In order to\nimprove the signal to background ratio (S/B), a neural\nnetwork is trained to identify the kinematic and topological characteristics of SM tt\u0304 events, and is applied to\ndata to select a signal-rich sample. Top quarks are then\nidentified by their distinctive decay into b quarks. Jets\noriginating from b quarks (b jets) are selected (\"tagged\")\nby their displaced vertex as defined by the secvtx algorithm [11]. After evaluating the average number of btagged jets for tt\u0304 events using a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation, the number of signal events in the sample and the\ncorresponding cross section are measured by counting the\nnumber of b-tagged jets in the sample selected by the neural network. The number of background b-tagged jets is\nestimated using per-jet parametrized probabilities of b-jet\nidentification, measured directly from data, rather than\nrelying on theoretical prediction of cross sections and MC\nsimulations. The results reported here are based on data\ntaken between March 2002 and August 2007, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.2 fb\u22121 , recorded by\nthe CDF experiment at Fermilab.\nThe organization of the paper is the following: Sec. II\ncontains a brief description of the CDF II detector and\nof the trigger requirements used for this analysis. The\npreliminary clean-up cuts applied to data are described\nin Sec. III, followed by the discussion of the data-driven\nbackground parametrization in Sec. IV. The kinematic\nvariables characterizing the missing energy plus jets final state and the neural network based sample selection\n\nare described in Sec. V and in Sec. VI respectively. We\nconclude the description of this measurement with a summary of the different sources of systematic uncertainties\nin Sec. VII, while the cross section measurement is presented in Sec. VIII.\n\nII.\n\nTHE CDF DETECTOR AND TRIGGER\nSYSTEM\n\nCDF II is a general\u2013purpose, azimuthally and forwardbackward symmetric detector located at the Tevatron\npp\u0304 collider at Fermilab. It consists of a charged-particle\ntracking system immersed in a 1.4 T magnetic field. The\nsolenoid is surrounded by calorimeters and muon detectors [12]. The CDF II coordinate system uses \u03b8 and \u03c6\nas the polar and azimuthal angles respectively, defined\nwith respect to the proton beam axis direction, z. The\nx-axis points towards the center of the accelerator while\nthe y axis upwards from the beam. The pseudorapidity\n\u03b7 is defined as \u03b7 \u2261 \u2212 ln[tan(\u03b8/2)]. The transverse momentum of a particle is pT = p sin \u03b8 and its transverse\nenergy ET = E sin \u03b8. The missing transverse energy E\n6 T\nmeasures the transverse energy of the neutrinos via the\nimbalance of the energy detected in the calorimeters; it\nP\n~ T | where E\nis defined by E\n6 T = |6E\n6 ~ T = \u2212 i ETi n\u0302i , the\nindex i runs over the calorimeter tower number and n\u0302i is\na unit vector perpendicular to the beam axis and pointing at the i -th calorimeter tower. The tracking system is\ncomposed of 8 layers of silicon microstrip detectors, extending from 1.6 cm to 28 cm and covering up to |\u03b7| <\n2.0, surrounded by a 3.1 m long open cell drift chamber,\nproviding |\u03b7| coverage up to 1.0. Using information from\nthe silicon detectors, the primary interaction vertex is\nreconstructed with a precision of \u223c 15 \u03bcm in the plane\ntransverse to the beam [13]. The energy of the particles\ntraversing the detector is measured by electromagnetic\nand hadronic calorimeters segmented into projective towers covering up to |\u03b7| < 3.6. In the central region (|\u03b7| <\n1.1) the calorimetric towers are 15\u25e6 wide in \u03c6 and 0.1 in \u03b7;\nin the forward region (1.1 < |\u03b7| < 3.6) the towers are 7.5\u25e6\nwide in azimuthal angle for |\u03b7| < 2.1 and 15\u25e6 for |\u03b7| > 2.1.\nThe electromagnetic section is made of lead-scintillator\nplates, while the hadronic section uses iron-scintillator\nones. The transverse profile of electromagnetic showers\nis measured by proportional chambers and scintillating\nstrip detectors. Muons are detected up to |\u03b7| < 0.6 by\ndrift chambers located outside the hadronic calorimeters,\nbehind a 60 cm iron shield. Additional drift chambers\nand scintillator detectors provide muon detection up to\n|\u03b7| < 1.5.\nThe CDF II trigger system [14] has a three level architecture designed to operate at 2.53 MHz and reduce\nthe data rate to approximately 120 Hz to be written on\ntape. The data used in this measurement are collected\nwith a purely calorimetric trigger, described in Sec. II A.\nAt Level-1 (L1) calorimetric towers are merged in pairs\nalong \u03b7 to define trigger towers: the L1 can take a de-\n\n\f5\ncision on the energy contribution of individual trigger\ntowers, on the sum of the energy of all the towers or on\nthe missing transverse energy of the event. At Level-2\n(L2) trigger towers are merged into clusters by a simple clustering algorithm [15], while at Level-3 (L3) jets\nof particles are reconstructed by a fixed cone-based algorithm p\n[16], the radius of the cone in the \u03b7 \u2212 \u03c6 plane\n(\u2206R = \u2206\u03b7 2 + \u2206\u03c62 ) being 0.4, 0.7 or 1 depending on\nthe specific trigger.\n\nA.\n\nThe Multijet trigger\n\nThe data used in this analysis are collected by a multijet trigger. This trigger requires at L1 the presence of at\nleast one central trigger tower with ET \u2265 10 GeV, and at\nL2 at least four calorimetric clusters with ET \u2265 15 GeV\neach and a total transverse energy greater than 175 GeV.\nThe latter threshold was 125 GeV before February 2005\nand was increased to reduce the trigger rate at higher\ninstantaneous luminosity. Finally, at L3, at least four\njets with ET \u226510 GeV (\u2206R = 0.4) are required. This\ntrigger was specifically designed to collect all-hadronic\ntt\u0304 events, where the final state nominally consists of six\njets, but has a large acceptance also on final states characterized by E\n6 T and high jet multiplicity. Moreover the\ncollected sample is uncorrelated with those used for top\ncross section measurements in the lepton plus jets final\nstate, which are selected by requiring the presence of a\nhigh momentum lepton. The choice of this trigger is also\ndriven by the analysis strategy: the top cross section\nmeasurement is performed by counting the number of btagged jets from top decay in the final sample and the\nmultijet trigger provides a sample that is unbiased with\nrespect to the b-tagging algorithm, as it does not apply\nany requirement on tracks.\n\nIII.\n\nPRELIMINARY REQUIREMENTS\n\nEvents satisfying the trigger requirements are used in\nthe analysis only if they were collected with fully operational tracking detectors, calorimeters and muon systems, and if their primary vertex is located within \u00b1 60\ncm along z from the center of CDF II detector. Jets\nand E\n6 T are corrected [17] for multiple pp\u0304 interactions in\nthe event, non uniformities in the calorimeter response\nalong \u03b7, and any non-linearity and energy loss in the\nuninstrumented regions of the calorimeters. The E\n6 T is\nalso corrected for the presence of high-pT muons. We\nconsider jets with \u2206R = 0.4, corrected transverse energy\nET \u2265 15 GeV\nPand |\u03b7| \u2264 2.0; the total transverse energy\nof the event\nET is defined as the sum of all jets ET .\nEvents are required to have at least three jets and no\ncentral high-pT (pT > 20 GeV/c) reconstructed electrons\nor muons to avoid overlaps with other top cross section\nmeasurements in lepton and jets final states [18]. In the\nsame way, overlaps with top all-hadronic analyses are\n\navoided by rejecting events\n6 T significance E\n6 sig\nT ,\npPwith low E\nP\nsig\ndefined as E\n6 T =E\n6 T/\nET where E\n6 T and\nET are\nmeasured in GeV, as the resolution on the E\n6 T is observed\nto degrade as a function of the total transverse energy\nof the event. The E\n6 sig\nis typically low when E\n6 T arises\nT\nfrom mismeasurements, so events are required to have\nE\n6 T sig \u2265 3 GeV1/2 .\nThroughout the paper, the impact of analysis requirements on signal is evaluated using inclusive tt\u0304 samples\ngenerated with pythia version v6.216 [19] and processed\nthrough CDF II detector and full trigger simulation [20],\nassuming a top mass mtop = 172.5 GeV/c2 (the most\nrecent CDF and D0 combined result on top mass is\nmtop = 173.3 \u00b1 1.1 GeV/c2 [21]). After the preliminary\ncuts, there are 94 217 events remaining in the sample\nwith at least four jets, with an expected signal to background ratio S/B of 1.4% and 44 310 events in the sample\nwith exactly three jets, with an expected S/B lower than\n0.1%. The latter sample, with a very low tt\u0304 signal content, will be used to derive the background parametrization in Sec. IV.\n\nIV.\n\nBACKGROUND PARAMETRIZATION\n\nIn this analysis, top quarks are identified by their decays into b quarks. However, many processes other than\nthe decay of the top quark can give rise to b jets, therefore a procedure to estimate the number of b-tagged jets\nyielded by background processes is needed.\nThe background-prediction method used in this analysis rests on the assumption that the probabilities of tagging a b jet in tt\u0304 signal and background processes are different: the differences are due to the distinctive properties of b jets produced by the top quark decays, compared\nto b jets arising from QCD and W boson plus heavy flavor\nproduction processes. In this hypothesis, parametrizing\nthe b-tag rates as a function of jet variables in events\ndepleted of signal allows one to predict the number of btagged jets from background processes in any given sample. The parametrization is derived from a sample of\npure background: the data sample after the prerequisites\nrequirement with exactly three jets, where the tt\u0304 signal\nfraction is lower than 0.1%. In this sample the per-jet btagging probability is found to depend mainly on jet ET ,\nthe number of good quality tracks contained in the jet\ncone Ntrk , and the E\n6 T projection along the jet direction\nE\n6 T prj , defined as E\n6 T prj = E\n6 T cos \u2206\u03c6(6E T , jet). These\nvariables are chosen for the parametrization and their\ncorresponding tag rate dependence is shown in Fig. 1. We\nexpect the tagging probability to depend on jet ET and\nNtrk due to the implementation details of the b-tagging\nalgorithm [11]. In more detail, the b-tagging probability decreases at high jet ET due to the declining yield of\ntracks passing the quality cuts required by the b-tagging\nalgorithm; it increases if a greater number of good quality\ntracks is associated to the jet cone. The E\n6 T projection\nalong the jet direction is correlated with the heavy flavor\n\n\f6\ncomponent of the sample and the geometric properties of\nthe event. Neutrinos from the b-quark semi-leptonic decays force E\n6 T to be aligned with the jet direction, while\nneutrinos from W boson decays are more likely to be\naway from jets. For this reason the b-tag rate is enhanced\nat high positive values of E\n6 T prj .\nA 3-dimensional b-tagging matrix P is defined using\nthe per-jet b-tagging probabilities, and its binning is defined to avoid any entries with empty denominators. The\nmatrix assigns the probability that a jet is b-tagged given\nits ET , Ntrk and E\n6 T prj .\nThe total number of expected background b-tagged jets\nNexp in a given data sample can be calculated by summing the b-tagging probabilities over all jets in the selected events:\nNexp =\n\nNevents\njets,i\nX NX\ni=1\n\nk\nPi (ETk , Ntrk\n,E\n6 T prj,k )\n\ntt\u0304 contribution from the background estimation. This\nmethod does not require knowledge of the top production cross section, once we assume that the dependence\nof \u000fave\ntag from the top quark mass is negligible.\nTo ensure the correct behavior of the b-tagging\nparametrization, an important check consists in calculating the predicted number of b-tagged jets in data samples\nwith jet multiplicities higher than three, and compare it\nwith the actual observed number of b-tagged jets. The result of this check is shown in Fig. 2. Taking into account\nthe expected contribution to the number of observed btagged jets due to the presence of tt\u0304 events in the sample (mtop = 172.5 GeV/c2 ), the agreement between the\namount of observed and predicted b-tagged jets is good\nin all the jet multiplicity bins, being exactly the same by\ndefinition for 3-jet events, on which the parametrization\nis calculated.\n\n(1)\n\nk=1\n\nwhere the index k runs over the number of jets Njets in\nthe i-th event and the index i runs over all the Nevents\nevents in the sample. Due to the method we used, Nexp\nis obtained under the same assumption that allowed the\nparametrization of the tagging rate, i.e. a negligible tt\u0304\nsignal content. For jet multiplicities greater than three,\nNexp will overestimate the number of b-tagged jets from\nbackground events, Nbkg , due to the presence of tt\u0304 events\nin the sample. If Nobs is the number of b-tagged jets observed in the data sample and we assume that the difference between Nobs and Nbkg is due to the presence of tt\u0304\nsignal, the number of top events in the sample ntop can be\nave\nevaluated as ntop = (Nobs \u2212 Nbkg )/\u000fave\ntag , where \u000ftag is the\naverage number of b-tagged jets per top event, defined\nas the ratio between the number of b-tagged jets and the\nnumber of tt\u0304 events and calculated from MC simulation.\nIf nevt is the number of events in the sample, we can estimate the number of b-tagged jets due to the background\nNbkg , by rescaling the value Nexp predicted by the btagging matrix as follows: Nbkg = Nexp (nevt \u2212ntop )/nevt .\nPutting the expressions for Nbkg and ntop together, we\ncan evaluate Nbkg as the limit of the following iterative\nformula:\nNbkg = lim Nexp,i\ni\u2192\u221e\n\n(2)\n\nV.\n\nSIGNAL AND BACKGROUND\nCHARACTERIZATION\n\nIn the data sample under investigation, tt\u0304 pairs are\noverwhelmed by multijet QCD and W + jets events. The\nmain feature of the tt\u0304 decay channel analyzed here is a\nconsiderable amount of E\n6 T , the only observable signature of the presence of neutrinos from W leptonic decays. However, missing transverse energy can be also produced by jet energy mismeasurements, by semi-leptonic\ndecays of b quarks in QCD events and by the leptonic\ndecay of the W in W + jets events. To discriminate\nagainst the possible sources of missing transverse energy on a geometric basis we use the quantity \u2206\u03c6min =\nmin \u2206\u03c6(6E T , jet), defined as the minimum angular difference between the E\n6 T and each jet in the event. This\nquantity is expected to be large in W \u2192 l\u03bd decays and\nin tt\u0304 \u2192 E\n6 T + jets events. On the other hand, for QCD\nbackground events where the main source of E\n6 T is due\nto jet energy mismeasurement, the E\n6 T is expected to be\naligned with the jet direction and the value of \u2206\u03c6min\nclose to zero.\nOther kinematic variables related to the topology of\nthe event characterize the tt\u0304 production with respect to\nbackground processes. Let Qj(j=1,3) be theP\neigenvalues of\nthe normalized momentum tensor Mab =\n\nwith\nNexp,i\n\nnevt \u2212 ntop\n= Nexp,0\nnevt\nnevt \u2212 (Nobs \u2212 Nexp,i\u22121 )/\u000fave\ntag\n= Nexp,0\nnevt\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Nexp,0 = Nexp is the number - fixed during the iteration - of expected b-tagged jets coming\nfrom the tag rate parametrization before any correction.\nIn our calculations the iterative procedure stops when\n|Nexp,i \u2212Nexp,i\u22121 |\n\u2264 1%. This correction procedure is used\nNexp,i\nin all samples with more than three jets to remove the\n\nP\n\nP\n\nj\n\nj\n\nja jb\nj\nP\n[22],\nP2\n\nwhere a, b run over the three space coordinates, and Pj\nis the momentum of the jet j. The sphericity S is defined as S = 32 (1 \u2212 Q3 ). S is zero in the limiting case\nof a pair of back-to-back jets, while approaches one for\nevents with a perfectly isotropic jet momenta distribution. The aplanarity A is defined as A = 32 Q1 and lies in\nthe range [0, 12 ]. Extremal values of A are reached in the\ncase of two opposite jets and in the case of evenly distributed jets, respectively. Jets emerging from a tt\u0304 pair\nare expected to be uniformly distributed and, as a consequence, they will hardly lie on the same plane: thus we\nexpect high aplanarity and sphericity values for tt\u0304 events.\n\n\f0.12\n0.1\n0.08\n\n0.22\n\nTag Rate\n\n0.14\n\nTag Rate\n\nTag Rate\n\n7\n\n0.2\n0.18\n0.16\n0.14\n\n0.12\n0.1\n0.08\n\n0.12\n0.1\n\n0.06\n\n0.14\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n0.04\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n0.04\n\n0.02\n\n0.02\n\n0.02\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n0\n2\n\n250\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n0\n-100 -80 -60 -40 -20\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\nprj\n\nNtrk\n\nET [GeV]\n\nET\n\n60\n\n80 100\n\n[GeV]\n\n(c)\n\n# of b-tagged jets\n\nFIG. 1. b tagging rates as a function of jet ET (a), Ntrk (b) and E\n6 T prj (c) for the data sample with exactly three jets in the\nevent.\n\n7000\nCDF Data L=2.2 fb-1\n\n6000\nBackground\n\n5000\n4000\n\nBackground\nuncertainty (stat)\n\n3000\n\nInclusive top\n(\u03c3=7.45 pb)\n\nVI.\n\n2000\n1000\n0\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nP\nconsequence 3 ET can help discriminating signal and\nbackground.

Tagging matrix check on data after preliminary\nrequirements and before any additional kinematic selection.\nObserved and predicted number of b-tagged jets as a function\nof the jet multiplicity are shown in the figure, statistical errors only. The expected contribution coming from tt\u0304 events\nbased on the theoretical cross section of \u03c3tt\u0304 = 7.45 pb is also\nshown. Background error bands are centered on the inclusive\ntop plus background prediction.\n\nIn addition to kinematic variables describing the topology of the event, distributions of energy-related variables\ncan be useful to discriminate tt\u0304 events overPtheir backET\nground. The centrality C is defined as C = \u221a\u015d , where\n\u221a\n\u015d is the invariant mass of the jets system. In the case\nof tt\u0304 pairs decaying hadronically, jets are emitted preferably in the transverse plane (r \u2212 \u03c6 plane), so we expect\nto have a greater amount of energy emitted in this plane\ngiving values of C closer\nP to 1 with respect to background\nevents. The variable 3 ET is defined as the sum of all\njets ET in the event except the two leading ones. In\nQCD events, the two most energetic jets are produced\nby q q\u0304 processes, while the least energetic ones come from\ngluon bremsstrahlung; on the contrary, in tt\u0304 events up\nto six jets can be produced by hard processes, and as a\n\nNEURAL NETWORK BASED EVENT\nSELECTION\n\nIn order to enhance the signal to background ratio in\nthe data sample, we use a neural network (NN), trained\nto discriminate tt\u0304 \u2192 E\n6 T + jets signal events from background. The NN is built using the neural network implementation in root [23].\nWe apply an additional kinematic requirement on data\nwith at least four jets, removing events with low angle between jets and E\n6 T with the cut \u2206\u03c6min (6E T , jets) > 0.4.\nIn the data these events come mostly from mismeasured\njets and are difficult to simulate in MC. They are removed from the NN training to prevent it from converging on artificial differences between MC and data rather\nthan real physics effects. After this requirement, we are\nleft with 20 043 events in the sample with at least four\njets, with an expected S/B of 3.5%: since this sample\nhas low tt\u0304 signal fraction and no overlap with data used\nto determine the background parametrization, it will be\nused as background training sample. As signal training\nsample we use the same amount of events passing the\nsame event selection of data, taken randomly from the tt\u0304\nsimulation. We use as inputs for the network the following kinematic variables, normalized with respect to their\nmaximum values: the transversePenergy\nPof the leading\njet ET1 , \u2206\u03c6min (6E T , jet), E\n6 T sig ,\nET , 3 ET , the centrality C, and the topology-related variables sphericity\nS and aplanarity A. The distributions of the input variables used in the NN for both the signal and background\ntraining samples are shown in Fig. 3.\nAfter the training, the b-tagged data are processed\nby the NN: Fig. 4 shows the number of observed b-\n\n\fBackground\n\n0.04\n\nSignal\n\n0.03\n0.02\n\n0.07\n\nFraction/(0.1 GeV1/2)\n\n0.05\n\nFraction/(0.025 rad)\n\nFraction/(3 GeV)\n\n8\n\nBackground\n\n0.06\n\nSignal\n\n0.05\n0.04\n0.03\n0.02\n\n0.01\n0.01\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nE1T [GeV]\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0.05\n0.045\n\nBackground\n\n0.04\n0.035\n\nSignal\n\n0.03\n0.025\n0.02\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n\u2206\u03c6\n\n1.8\n\n[rad]\n\n0.1\n0.08\n0.06\n0.04\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n0.01\n\n300\n\n400\n\n0.08\n\nBackground\n\n0.07\n0.06\n\nSignal\n\n0.05\n0.04\n\n500\n\n0\n\n600\n\n9\n\n10\n\n[GeV1/2]\n\n0.05\n0.045\n\nBackground\n\n0.04\n0.035\n\nSignal\n\n0.03\n0.025\n0.015\n0.01\n0.005\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n(d)\n\n200\n\n0\n0\n\n250\n\n\u03a33 ET [GeV]\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9\n\n(f)\nFraction/(0.005)\n\n0.025\n\nBackground\n0.02\n\nSignal\n\n0.015\n0.01\n\n1\n\nCentrality\n\n(e)\nFraction/(0.01)\n\nsig\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\n\n\u03a3 ET [GeV]\n\n8\n\n(c)\n\n0.01\n\n0.005\n\n7\n\nET\n\n0.02\n\n200\n\nSignal\n\n0.12\n\n0\n3\n\n2\n\n0.015\n\n100\n\n0.14\n\n(b)\nFraction/(5 GeV)\n\nFraction/(5 GeV)\n\n1.2\n\nmin\n\n(a)\n\n0\n0\n\nBackground\n\n0.16\n\n0.02\n\n0\n0.4\n\n300\n\nFraction/(0.01)\n\n0\n0\n\n0.18\n\n0.2\n\nBackground\n\n0.18\n0.16\n\nSignal\n\n0.14\n0.12\n0.1\n0.08\n0.06\n0.04\n\n0.005\n\n0.02\n0\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n0\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\nAplanarity\n\nSphericity\n\n(g)\n\n(h)\n\nFIG. 3.

The good\nagreement between data and the sum of expected background and tt\u0304 induced b-tagged jets in the high NN output region is both a confirmation of the effectiveness of\nthe method we use to estimate the background and a\ndemonstration of proper NN training and performance.\nIn order to select a signal-rich sample to perform the\ncross section measurement, we choose to cut on the NN\noutput value NNout . The cut is chosen with the aim of\nminimizing the statistical uncertainty on the cross section measurement, maximizing S/B where S is the expected number of b-tagged jets from the signal and B is\nthe predicted number of background b-tagged jets. The\n\nformer quantity is evaluated from an inclusive tt\u0304 MC sample, while the latter is derived using the b-tagging matrix\nparametrization on data. The result of this optimization\nprocedure is a cut on NNout \u2265 0.8, which gives the lowest expected statistical uncertainty on the cross section\n(\u223c 8%) and an expected S/B \u223c 4.

Finally, L is the integrated luminosity of the dataset used.\nAll quantities in the denominator of Eq. 4, as well as the\nnumber of expected b-tagged jets, are subject to different\nsources of systematic uncertainties.\n\n\f10\nThe kinematic efficiency \u000fkin is evaluated on inclusive\ntt\u0304 samples generated with pythia and its uncertainty\narises from the particular choice of the MC generator,\nthe set of parton density functions used in the generator,\nas well as the modeling of color reconnection effects and\nof the initial and final state radiation.\nThe MC generators differ in their hadronization\nschemes and in their description of the underlying event\nand multiple interactions: in order to evaluate the generator dependence of the kinematic efficiency, we compare\nthe value of \u000fkin obtained using pythia with the value\nobtained on a sample of events generated with herwig\nv6.510 [24], and take the relative difference as the systematic uncertainty.\nThe choice of parton distribution function (PDF) affects\nthe kinematics of tt\u0304 events, and thus the acceptance for\nsignal events. We estimate this uncertainty comparing\nthe \u000fkin value derived from MC samples based on the\ndefault PDF CTEQ5L [25] with the one obtained using\nsamples based on MRST72 and MRST75 [26], which differ by the value of the strong coupling constant \u03b1s used to\ncompute the PDF; we also consider the difference in the\nvalue of \u000fkin obtained with the leading order (LO) and\nnext to leading order (NLO) calculations of PDFs, evaluated using default CTEQ5L (LO) and CTEQ6M (NLO)\nPDFs, and derive the corresponding uncertainty. We add\nthese two contributions in quadrature to obtain the systematic uncertainty due to our choice of PDF.\nUncertainties arising from the modeling of color reconnections effects are estimated by evaluating the shift in\nthe kinematic efficiency using two samples of events generated by pythia, corresponding to different models of\ncolor reconnection [27].\nAdditional jets coming from initial and final state radiation (ISR and FSR), might change the sample composition and affect the efficiency of the kinematic selection. The systematic uncertainty related to these effects\nis evaluated by calculating the shift in \u000fkin using inclusive tt\u0304 samples with different amounts of initial and final\nstate radiation.\nThe systematic uncertainty due to the calorimeter response is accounted for by varying the corrected jet energies within \u00b11\u03c3 of their corresponding systematic uncertainty, and recalculating \u000fkin after these variations.\nFinally, \u000fkin is also affected by the simulation of the trigger requirements on MC events and a trigger acceptance\nuncertainty is determined by comparing trigger turn-on\ncurves between MC and data events.\nThe average number of b-tagged jets per tt\u0304 event is\naffected by the uncertainty on the scale factor used to\naccount for the different efficiency of the b-tagging algorithm in data and in MC. The systematic uncertainty on\n\u000fave\ntag is obtained varying the scale factor within the \u00b11\u03c3\nrange from its central value and determining, on the MC\nsample, the difference in terms of average number of btagged jets per event with respect to the standard \u000fave\ntag\nvalue.\nThe uncertainty on the number Nexp of matrix-predicted\n\nTABLE II.
