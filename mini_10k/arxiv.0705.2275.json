A Froggatt-Nielsen type model is assumed, and the flavor\nstructures of the masses and mixing are caused by VEVs of SU(2)L -singlet scalars \u03c6u and \u03c6d\nwhich are nonets (8+1) of the SU(3) flavor symmetry, and which are broken into 2+3+3\u2032 and\n1 of S4 .

The observed tribimaximal neutrino mixing is understood by\n(\u00b1)\nassuming two SU(3) singlet right-handed neutrinos \u03bdR and an SU(3) triplet scalar \u03c7.\n\n1 Introduction\nThe observed mass spectra and mixings of the fundamental particles will provide promising\nclues to unified understanding of the quarks and leptons. Especially, in the lepton sector, the\nfollowing characteristic features have been observed [1]:\n(i) The observed charged lepton masses (me , m\u03bc , m\u03c4 ) satisfy the relation [2, 3]\n\u221a\n2 \u221a\n\u221a\nme + m\u03bc + m\u03c4 = ( me + m\u03bc + m\u03c4 )2 ,\n3\n\n(1.1)\n\nwith remarkable precision;\n(ii) The observed neutrino mixing U\u03bd is approximately given by the so-called tribimaximal\nmixing [4]\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u221a2\n\u221a1\n0\n6\n3\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\u221a1\n\u221a1\n\u221a1 \uf8f7 .\n\u2212\n\u2212\nUT B = \uf8ec\n(1.2)\n\uf8ed\n6\n3\n2 \uf8f8\n\u221a1\n\u2212 \u221a16 \u221a13\n2\nSuch characteristic features have not been seen in the quark sector. For example, the mixing\nform (1.2) suggests that the mixing can be described by Clebsh-Gordan-like coefficients, while,\nfor the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa mixing in the quark sector, such a characteristic feature\nhas not been seen, although we have known some relations among the mixing angles and quark\nmass ratios. Therefore, for a start, in the present paper, we investigate the lepton masses and\nmixings.\nIn order to understand the relation (1.1), for example, we assume that there are three\nscalars \u03c6i (i = 1, 2, 3), and the values of the charged lepton masses mei are proportional to the\nsquare of the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) vi = h\u03c6i i of the scalars \u03c6i , mei = kvi2 (in the\n\n\fRef.[3, 5, 6], for instance, a seesaw type model (Me )ij = \u03b4ij vi (ME )\u22121 vj has been assumed). We\ndefine singlet \u03c6\u03c3 and doublet (\u03c6\u03c0 , \u03c6\u03b7 ) of a permutation symmetry S3 [7] by\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n0\n\u03c6\u03c0\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed \u03c6\u03b7 \uf8f8 = \uf8ed \u221a26\n\u221a1\n\u03c6\u03c3\n\uf8eb\n\n3\n\n\u2212 \u221a12\n\n\u2212 \u221a16\n\u221a1\n3\n\n\u221a1\n2\n\u2212 \u221a16\n\u221a1\n3\n\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\u03c61\n\uf8f7\uf8ec\n\uf8f7 \uf8ed \u03c62 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8,\n\uf8f8\n\u03c63\n\n(1.3)\n\nfrom the three objects (\u03c61 , \u03c62 , \u03c63 ), and we consider the following S3 invariant scalar potential\nV (\u03c6) [3, 8, 9]:\nV (\u03c6) = m2 (\u03c62\u03c0 + \u03c62\u03b7 + \u03c62\u03c3 ) + \u03bb1 (\u03c62\u03c0 + \u03c62\u03b7 + \u03c62\u03c3 )2 + \u03bb2 \u03c62\u03c3 (\u03c62\u03c0 + \u03c62\u03b7 ).\n\n(1.4)\n\nThe minimizing condition of the potential (1.4) leads to the relation\nv\u03c02 + v\u03b72 = v\u03c32 .\n\n(1.5)\n\n2\nv12 + v22 + v32 = (v1 + v2 + v3 )2 ,\n3\n\n(1.6)\n\nThe relation (1.5) means\n\nbecause\nv12 + v22 + v32 = v\u03c02 + v\u03b72 + v\u03c32 = 2v\u03c32 = 2\n\n\u0012\n\nv1 + v2 + v3\n\u221a\n3\n\n\u00132\n\n.\n\n(1.7)\n\nTherefore, we can obtain the mass relation (1.1). Here, note that although the scalar potential\n(1.4) is invariant under the S3 symmetry, but it is not a general one of the S3 invariant form. As\npointed out in Ref. [9], the scalar potential with a general form cannot lead to the relation (1.5).\nFor the derivation of the VEV relation (1.5), it is essential to choose the specific form (1.4) of\nthe S3 invariant terms. Similar formulation is also possible for other discrete symmetries A4 [10]\nand S4 (see below). However, in such a symmetry, we still need an additional specific selection\nrule. What is the meaning of such a specific selection? In the present paper, we investigate this\nproblem by assuming that the S4 flavor symmetry is embedded into SU(3).\nRecently, a superpotential which leads to the relation (1.5) has proposed by Ma [11] on the\nbasis of a symmetry \u03a3(81). Stimulated by the Ma's idea, the author [10] has also investigated\na similar superpotential on the basis of a symmetry A4 . Here, based on an S4 flavor symmetry\ninstead of the A4 symmetry, let us review the superpotential W which gives the relation (1.5).\nWe denote singlet and doublet of S4 as \u03c6\u03c3 and \u03c6D = (\u03c6\u03c0 , \u03c6\u03b7 )T , respectively, as well as those\nin S3 . In order to write the superpotential for the scalar fields \u03c6\u03c3 and doublet \u03c6D of S4 , we\nput the following phenomenological rule [10]: the field \u03c6a (a = \u03c3, D) to the power nth, (\u03c6a )n\n(n = 1, 2, 3), appears always accompanied with the factor 1/n! in the superpotential W . Under\nthis phenomenological rule, we can uniquely write the superpotential of \u03c6\u03c3 and \u03c6D as\n\u0001\n1\nW (\u03c6) = m \u03c62\u03c3 + \u03c6TD \u03c6D + \u03bb\n2!\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n1\n\u03c6\u03c3 \u03c6TD \u03c6D + \u03c63\u03c3\n2!\n3!\n\n\u0013\n\n\f\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0001 1\n1\n1 3\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n= m \u03c6\u03c3 + \u03c6\u03c0 + \u03c6\u03b7 + \u03bb (\u03c6\u03c0 + \u03c6\u03b7 )\u03c6\u03c3 + \u03c6\u03c3 .\n2\n2\n3\n\n(1.8)\n\nThe potential (1.8) can also lead the relation (1.5). What is the meaning of this phenomenological\nrule?\nOn the other hand, we have to consider a mechanism which yields the charged lepton masses\nmei \u221d vi2 , i.e. the effective Hamiltonian for the charged lepton sector\n\u0003\n\u0002\nHeef f = \u0113L1 (\u03c61 )2 eR1 + \u0113L2 (\u03c62 )2 eR2 + \u0113L3 (\u03c63 )2 eR3 .\n\n(1.9)\n\nWe will propose a Froggatt-Nielsen type model [12], Heef f = (l\u0304L HLd \u03c6\u03c6eR ) in Sec.4.\nNow, let us return the topic of the tribimaximal mixing. From the definition (1.2), we can\ndenote the fields (\u03c81 , \u03c82 , \u03c83 ) as\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u03c8\u03b7\n\u03c81\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed \u03c82 \uf8f8 = UT B \uf8ed \u03c8\u03c3 \uf8f8 .\n\u03c8\u03c0\n\u03c83\n\uf8eb\n\n(1.10)\n\nThe observed neutrino mixing (1.2) means that when the mass eigenstates of the charged leptons are given by the (\u03c81 , \u03c82 , \u03c83 ) basis, the mass eigenstates of the neutrinos are given by the\n(\u03c8\u03b7 , \u03c8\u03c3 , \u03c8\u03c0 ) basis. Therefore, the problem is to find a model where the charged lepton mass\neigenstates are (e1 , e2 , e3 ), while the neutrino mass eigenstates are given by (\u03bd\u03b7 , \u03bd\u03c3 , \u03bd\u03c0 ) with the\nmasse hierarchy m2\u03b7 < m2\u03c3 \u226a m2\u03c0 (or m2\u03c0 \u226a m2\u03b7 < m2\u03c3 ). In the present paper, we will investigate\nsuch a model based on an S4 model. Here, note that the fermions (\u03c81 , \u03c82 , \u03c83 ) is a triplet of\nS4 , but the basis (\u03c8\u03b7 , \u03c8\u03c3 , \u03c8\u03c0 ) is not in any irreducible representations of S4 , while the scalar\n(\u03c61 , \u03c62 , \u03c63 ) is not irreducible representation of S4 , but (\u03c6\u03c0 , \u03c6\u03b7 ) and \u03c6\u03c3 are doublet and singlet\nof S4 .\nThus, the characteristic features (1.1) and (1.2) in the lepton sector may be understood from\nthe language of S4 (also S3 or A4 ). However, as seen from the above review, the characteristic\nfeatures (1.1) and (1.2) cannot be understood from the S4 symmetry only. We need some\nadditional assumptions. In this paper, we will investigate these problems under an assumption\nthat the present S4 symmetry is embedded into an SU(3) symmetry [13]. In the next section,\nthe singlet \u03c6\u03c3 and doublet (\u03c6\u03c0 , \u03c6\u03b7 ) will be understood as members of a nonet scalar \u03c6 [1+8 of\nSU(3)], and the VEV relation (1.5) will be derived by requiring that W (\u03c6) is invariant under a\nZ2 symmetry.\nWe know that the three masses in any sectors of quarks and leptons are completly different\namong them. Therefore, if we assume a flavor symmetry, the symmetry must finally be broken\ncompletely. Usually, a relation which we derive in the exact symmetry limit is only approximately\nsatisfied under the symmetry breaking. Although we derive the VEV relation (1.5) under the\nS4 symmetry, the problem is whether the VEV relation (1.5) which is obtained under the S4\nsymmetry is spoiled or not when we introduce such a symmetry breaking. In Sec.3, we will\ndemonstrate that such a symmetry breaking term without spoiling the relation (1.5) is indeed\npossible.\n\n\fIn Sec.4, in order to give the charged lepton masses and tribimaximal neutrino mixing, we\nwill discuss the effective Hamiltonian by assuming an Froggatt-Nelsen [12] type model. Finally,\nSec.5 will be devoted to the summary and concluding remarks.\n\n2 VEVs of SU(3) nonet scalars\nThe goal in the present section is to obtain the VEV relation (1.6) [i.e. (1.5)]. As seen\nin the previous section, in order to obtain the desirable results (1.5), we need assume an equal\nweight between the doublet and singlet terms of S4 . In the present paper, we assume that the\nS4 symmetry is embedded into an SU(3) symmetry. The doublet (\u03c6\u03c0 , \u03c6\u03b7 ) and singlet \u03c6\u03c3 of S4\nare embedded in the 6 and (8 + 1) of SU(3) [13]. In the present paper, we assume that the\ndoublet (\u03c6\u03c0 , \u03c6\u03b7 ) and singlet \u03c6\u03c3 originate in SU(3) octet and singlet, respectively. The essential\nassumption in the present paper is that the fields \u03c6u and \u03c6d always appear in the theory with\nthe form of the nonet of U(3):\n\uf8f6\n\u03c611 \u03c621 \u03c631\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\u03c6 = \uf8ed \u03c612 \u03c622 \u03c632 \uf8f8 ,\n\u03c613 \u03c623 \u03c633\n\uf8eb\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere\n\u03c611 =\n\u03c622 =\n\u03c633\n\n=\n\n\u221a1 \u03c6\u03c3\n3\n\u221a1 \u03c6\u03c3\n3\n\u221a1 \u03c6\u03c3\n3\n\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\n\u221a2 \u03c6\u03b7 ,\n6\n\u221a1 \u03c6\u03b7 \u2212 \u221a1 \u03c6\u03c0 ,\n6\n2\n\u221a1 \u03c6\u03b7 + \u221a1 \u03c6\u03c0 ,\n6\n2\n\n(2.2)\n\nand the index f (f = u, d) has been dropped.\nThe outline to obtain the superpotential form (1.8) in the present scenairo is as follows:\nThe SU(3) invariant superpotential for the nonet fields \u03c6f (f = u, d) are given by\n1\n1\nW (\u03c6f ) = mf Tr(\u03c6f \u03c6f ) + \u221a \u03bbf Tr(\u03c6f \u03c6f \u03c6f ).\n2\n2 3\n\n(2.3)\n\nSince, in the next section, we want to assign chages +1 and \u22121 of a Z3 symmetry to the fields\n\u03c6u and \u03c6d , respectively, we also assign the Z3 charges +1 and \u22121 to the mass parameters mu\nand md in Eq.(2.3), respectively. However, since we do not consider a mass term Tr(\u03c6u \u03c6d ), we\ndo not consider a mass parameter with the Z3 charge zero. Hereafter, in the present section, for\nconvenience, we will drop the index f , since the cross terms between \u03c6u and \u03c6d do not appear.\nIn the superpotential (2.3), although the term Tr(\u03c6\u03c6) gives the desirable term \u03c62\u03c0 + \u03c62\u03b7 + \u03c62\u03c3 + * * *\nof S4 , the cubic term Tr(\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6) gives\n\nTr(\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6) =\n\n\u221a\n\n\u0014\n\n1\n3 \u221a\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2212\u03c62\u03c0\n\n\u0013\n\u0015\n1 2\n1 3\n2\n2\n+ \u03c6\u03b7 \u03c6\u03b7 + (\u03c6\u03c0 + \u03c6\u03b7 )\u03c6\u03c3 + \u03c6\u03c3 + * * * ,\n3\n3\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere the terms \"* * * \" denote terms which include 3 and 3\u2032 of the subgroup S4 . Therefore, the\npotential (2.3) cannot give the relation (1.5). We must drop the first term in the cubic terms\n\n\f(2.4). For this purpose, we introduce a Z2 symmetry, and we assign the Z2 parities \u22121 and\n+1 (the Z2 charge +1 and 0) for the octet part \u03c6(8) and singlet part \u03c6(1) of the nonet field \u03c6,\nrespectively. The symmetry Z2 breaks U(3) into SU(3). (In other words, in the present model,\nthe flavor symmetry U(3) is explicitly broken from the begining by the Z2 symmetry. ) Under\nthe requirement of the Z2 invariance, i.e. the invariance under the transformation\n(\u03c6(8) , \u03c6(1) ) \u2192 (\u2212\u03c6(8) , +\u03c6(1) ),\n\n(2.5)\n\nthe terms Tr(\u03c6(8) \u03c6(8) \u03c6(8) ), i.e. (\u2212\u03c62\u03c0 + (1/3)\u03c62\u03b7 )\u03c6\u03b7 + * * * , are forbidden. Thus, the superpotential\n(2.3) with the Z2 invariance leads to\n\u0015\n\u0014\ni 1\n1 h\n1 2\n(8) (8)\n2\n(8) (8)\nW (\u03c6) = m Tr(\u03c6 \u03c6 ) + \u03c6\u03c3 + \u03bb\u03c6\u03c3 Tr(\u03c6 \u03c6 ) + \u03c6\u03c3\n2\n2\n3\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0001 1\n1 3\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n= m \u03c6\u03c3 + \u03c6\u03c0 + \u03c6\u03b7 + \u03bb (\u03c6\u03c0 + \u03c6\u03b7 )\u03c6\u03c3 + \u03c6\u03c3 + * * * .\n2\n2\n3\n\n(2.6)\n\nThe form (2.6) is just identical with (1.8) except for the \"* * * \" terms. As we show below, the\npotential (2.6) can give the desirable VEV relation (1.5) together with h\u03c6ji i = 0 (i 6= j).\nFrom the superpotential (2.6) with the Z2 invariance, we obtain the VEV relation (1.5) as\nfollows: From the condition\n\u2202W\n\u2202(\u03c6(8) )ji\n\n= m(\u03c6(8) )ij + \u03bb\u03c6\u03c3 (\u03c6(8) )ij = 0,\n\n(2.7)\n\nwe obtain\nm + \u03bb\u03c6\u03c3 = 0,\n\n(2.8)\n\nfor (\u03c6(8) )ji 6= 0. By eliminating m from Eq.(2.8) and the condition\ni\n\u2202W\n1 h\n= m\u03c6\u03c3 + \u03bb Tr(\u03c6(8) \u03c6(8) ) + \u03c62\u03c3 = 0,\n\u2202\u03c6\u03c3\n2\n\n(2.9)\n\n\u03c62\u03c3 = Tr(\u03c6(8) \u03c6(8) ) = \u03c62\u03c0 + \u03c62\u03b7 + * * * ,\n\n(2.10)\n\nwe obtain the relation\nwhere \"* * * \" denotes the contributions of 3 and 3\u2032 of S4 .\nThe result (2.10) is still not our goal, because the relation contains the VEVs of the 3 and\n\u2032\n3 of S4 . So far, we have not discussed the splitting among the S4 multiplets. Now, we bring a\nsoft symmetry breaking of SU(3) into S4 with an infinitesimal parameter \u03b5 into the mass term\nof W (\u03c6) as\nX\nTr(\u03c6(8) \u03c6(8) ) \u21d2 \u03c6\u03c0 \u03c6\u03c0 + \u03c6\u03b7 \u03c6\u03b7 + (1 + \u03b5)\n(2.11)\n(\u03c6(8) )ji (\u03c6(8) )ij ,\ni6=j\n\nby hand. (At present, we do not refer the origin of the symmetry breaking. The SU(3) flavor\nsymmetry is explicitly (not spontaneously) broken with the order of \u03b5.) Recall that when we\n\n\fobtain the relation (2.8), we have assumed (\u03c6(8) )ji 6= 0. Now, the conditions (2.7) are modified\ninto the folloing conditons:\n[(1 + \u03b5)m + \u03bb\u03c6\u03c3 ] (\u03c6(8) )ij = 0 (i 6= j),\n(m + \u03bb\u03c6\u03c3 ) \u03c6a = 0\n\n(2.12)\n\n(a = \u03c0, \u03b7),\n\n(2.13)\n\nThefore, we must take either (\u03c6(8) )ij = 0 (i 6= j) or \u03c6a = 0 (a = \u03c0, \u03b7) for \u03b5 6= 0. When we choose\nthe solution\nh(\u03c6(8) )ij i = 0 (i =\n6 j),\n(2.14)\nwe can obtain the desiarable relation (1.5). (However, it is possible that we can also take another\nsolution with \u03c6\u03c0 = \u03c6\u03b7 = 0 and (\u03c6(8) )ij 6= 0. The VEV solutions are not unique. The result (1.5)\nis merely one of the possible solutions.)\nThus, we have obtained not only the desirable VEV relation (1.5), but also the results\n(2.14). It should be worthwhile noticing that if we have assume the superpotential (2.3) without\nrequiring the Z2 invariance, we could obtain neither (1.5) nor (2.14).\n\n3 Superpotential with symmetry breaking\nSince we know that the three masses in any sectors of quarks and leptons are completely\ndifferent among them, we must consider that any flavor symmetry which we introduced should\nfinally be broken completely. Although the superpotential (1.8) can give the VEV relation (1.5),\nit cannot fix the ratio v\u03c0 /v\u03b7 . In order to fix the ratio v\u03c0 /v\u03b7 , we consider the existence of an\nS4 symmetry breaking term WSB . Then, the problem is whether the VEV relation (1.5) which\nhas been obtained under the S4 symmetry which is embedded into SU(3) is spoiled or not by\nintroducing such a symmetry breaking, because, usually, a relation which we have derived under\nan exact symmetry is only approximately satisfied under the symmetry breaking. In the present\nsection, we will demonstrate that such a symmetry breaking term without spoiling the relation\n(1.5) is indeed possible.\nWe consider that the S4 invariant superpotential (1.8) is softly broken. Since we want\nv\u03c0 /v\u03b7 6= 1, the breaking should appear in the doublet part of S4 . In order to express the S4\nsymmetry breaking term explicitly, we define the following symmetry breaking parameters B (8)\nand B (1) with 3 \u00d7 3 matrix forms,\n\nB (1) =\n\n\u0010\n\n\u221a2 b\u03b7 , \u2212 \u221a1 b\u03b7 \u2212 \u221a1 b\u03c0 , \u2212 \u221a1 b\u03b7\n6\n2\n6\n\u0011\n\u0010 6\ndiag \u221a13 b\u03c3 , \u221a13 b\u03c3 , \u221a13 b\u03c3 ,\n\nB (8) = diag\n\n+\n\n\u221a1 b\u03c0\n2\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhich behave as if those were octet and singlet of SU(3), respectively, where\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(3.2)\nb\u03b7 = 2 sin \u03b2, b\u03c0 = 2 cos \u03b2, b\u03c3 = 1,\n\u221a\nand the factor 2 in Eq.(3.2) has been chosen as b2\u03c0 + b2\u03b7 = 2 compared with b2\u03c3 = 1. Then, we\ncan express the symmetry breaking term as the form\n\nWSB =\n\n\u221a\n\nh\ni\n3\n\u03b5m Tr(B (8) \u03c6(8) \u03c6(8) ) + Tr(B (1) \u03c6(1) \u03c6(1) )\n2\n\n\f=\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\n\u03b5m \u22122\u03c6\u03c0 \u03c6\u03b7 cos \u03b2 \u2212 (\u03c62\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c62\u03b7 ) sin \u03b2 + \u03c62\u03c3 ,\n2\n\n(3.3)\n\n\u221a\nwhere the factor 3/2 has been chosen as the coefficients in the expression (3.3) correspond to\n\u221a\nthose in the unbroken form (1.8). Although the term Tr(B (1) \u03c6(1) \u03c6(1) ) = \u03c62\u03c3 / 3 in (3.3) does\nnot break the S4 symmetry, it has been added by hand in order that the term WSB (in other\nwords, the parameter \u03b5) does not affect the VEV relation (1.5).\nAs the result, we can write the superpotential including the symmetry breaking term as\nfollows:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1 \b 2\n1\n1 2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nW = m \u03c6\u03c0 + \u03c6\u03b7 + (1 + \u03b5)\u03c6\u03c3 \u2212 \u03b5 2\u03c6\u03c0 \u03c6\u03b7 cos \u03b2 + (\u03c6\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c6\u03b7 ) sin \u03b2 + \u03bb\u03c6\u03c3 \u03c6\u03b7 + \u03c6\u03c0 + \u03c6\u03c3 .\n2\n2\n3\n(3.4)\nSince\n\n\u2202W\n= [m + \u03bb\u03c6\u03c3 \u2212 \u03b5m sin \u03b2] \u03c6\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b5m\u03c6\u03b7 cos \u03b2,\n\u2202\u03c6\u03c0\n\n(3.5)\n\n\u2202W\n= [m + \u03bb\u03c6\u03c3 + \u03b5m sin \u03b2] \u03c6\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b5m\u03c6\u03c0 cos \u03b2,\n\u2202\u03c6\u03b7\n\n(3.6)\n\n1\n\u2202W\n= m(1 + \u03b5)\u03c6\u03c3 + \u03bb(\u03c62\u03c0 + \u03c62\u03b7 + \u03c62\u03c3 ),\n\u2202\u03c6\u03c3\n2\n\n(3.7)\n\nthe minimizing conditions of the potential leads to the relations\n\ntan \u03b2 =\n\nv\u03c02 \u2212 v\u03b72\n,\n2v\u03c0 v\u03b7\n\n(3.8)\n\nv\u03c02 + v\u03b72 = v\u03c32 ,\n\n(3.9)\n\nm(1 + \u03b5) + \u03bbv\u03c3 = 0.\n\n(3.10)\n\nNote that the derivation of the relation (3.8) is independent of the explicit values of m, \u03bb and\n\u03b5, and the derivation of the relation (3.9) is independent of the explicit values of m, \u03bb, \u03b5 and\n\u03b2. Thus, we can fix the value of v\u03c0 /v\u03b7 by the parameter \u03b2 in WSB without spoiling the VEV\n\u221a\nrelation (1.5) [(3.9)]. Also note that the limit me \u2192 0 corresponds to the limit v\u03b7 \u2192 \u2212v\u03c3 / 2\n(i.e. v\u03b72 = v\u03c02 ), so that the limit me \u2192 0 corresponds to \u03b2 \u2192 0.\n\u221a\n\u221a\nWhen we define the parameters zi = mei / me + m\u03bc + m\u03c4 , from the observed values [1]\nof the charged lepton masses, we obtain the numerical values z1 = 0.016473, z2 = 0.236869 and\nz3 = 0.971402, so that, for the VEVs of \u03c6a defined by Eq.(1.3) [(2.2)], we obtain z\u03c0 = 0.519393,\n\u221a\nz\u03b7 = \u22120.479824 and z\u03c3 = 1/ 2 = 0.707106. Therefore, we can estimate the value of \u03b2 as\nfollows:\nsin \u03b2 =\n\nz\u03b72 \u2212 z\u03c02\n= 4z\u03b72 \u2212 1 = \u22120.079078,\nz\u03b72 + z\u03c02\n\n\u03b2 = \u22124.5355\u25e6 ,\n\nwhere we have chosen the phase convention of \u03b2 as cos \u03b2 = \u22122z\u03c0 z\u03b7 /(z\u03b72 + z\u03c02 ) > 0.\n\n(3.11)\n\n\fTable 1 SU(3) and S4 assignments of the fields\nFields\n\nSU(2)L\n\nSU(3)\n\nS4\n\nZ3\n\nZ\u20323\n\nZ2\n\n3\u2032\n\nlL\neR\n\n2\n1\n\n3\n3\n\n3\u2032\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n\u03bdR\n\n(\u00b1)\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0/+1\n\n\u03c6u\n\u03c6d\n\u03be (\u00b1)\n\u03c7\nHLu\nHLd\n\u03a6R\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n1\n\n1+8\n1+8\n1\n3\n1\n1\n1\n\n1 + (2 + 3 + 3\u2032 )\n1 + (2 + 3 + 3\u2032 )\n1\n3\u2032\n1\n1\n1\n\n+1\n\u22121\n0\n+1\n+1\n\u22121\n0\n\n+1\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n0\n0\n0\n\n0/+1\n0/+1\n0/+1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\nFrom the point of view of the prameter physics, the introducing the symmetry breaking\nterm (3.3) is merely replacing the parameter v\u03c0 /v\u03b7 by another parameter \u03b2. What is important\nis that we can indeed introduce a symmetry breaking term without spoiling the relation (1.5).\n\n4 Effective Hamiltonian\nIf we regard the scalars \u03c6u and \u03c6d as SU(2)L doublets, such a model with multi-Higgs\ndoublets causes a flavor changing neutral current (FCNC) problem. Therefore, we must consider\nthat the fields \u03c6u and \u03c6d are SU(2)L singlets. In the present paper, we assume a Froggatt-Nielsen\n[12] type model\n\nH ef f = ye lL HLd\n\n\u03c6d \u03c6d \u03be\n\u03c6u \u03c7\n\u2217\n,\neR + y\u03bd lL HLu\n\u03bdR + y R \u03bd R \u03a6 R \u03bdR\n\u039b \u039b\u039b\n\u039b \u039b\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere liL are SU(2)L doublet leptons liL = (\u03bdiL , eiL ), HLd and HLu are conventional SU(2)L\ndoublet Higgs scalars, \u03c6f (f = u, d), \u03be and \u03c7 are SU(2)L singlet scalars, and \u039b is a scale of the\neffective theory. We consider that h\u03c6f i/\u039b, h\u03bei/\u039b and h\u03c7i/\u039b are of the order of 1. The scalar \u03a6R\nhas been introduced in order to generate the Majorana mass MR of the right-handed neutrino\n(\u2212) \u221a\n(+)\n\u03bdR . As we note later, in the present model, the right-handed neutrinos \u03bdR = (\u03bdR + \u03bdR )/ 2\n\u221a\nare singlets of the SU(3) flavor. The role of \u03be = (\u03be (+) + \u03be (\u2212) )/ 2 and \u03c7 will be explained\nlater. In order to understand the appearance of the combinations HLd \u03c6d \u03c6d \u03be and HLu \u03c6u \u03c7, we\nassume two Z3 symmetries (Z3 and Z\u20323 in Table 1). Those quantum number assignments are\ngiven in Table 1. However, even with those quantum numbers, we cannot distinguish the state\n\u03c6\u2020f from \u03c6f \u03c6f . For example, the interaction l\u0304L Hd \u03c6\u2020d \u03beeR is possible in addition to the interaction\nl\u0304L Hd \u03c6d \u03c6d \u03beeR . Although we have started from an SUSY senario in the previous section, now,\nwe have adopted an effective Hamiltonian which is not renormalizable. Therefore, in principle,\nthe interaction l\u0304L Hd \u03c6\u2020d \u03beeR cannot be ruled out. For the moment, in order to forbid such an\nundesirable term, we assume that the fields which can appear in the effective Hamiltonian are\nconfined to holomorphic ones.\n\n\f(a) Charged lepton sector\nRecall that we have already assumed the invariance of the superpotential under the Z2\ntransformation (2.5) in order to drop the cubic part of the octet \u03c6(8) . Therefore, the term\n\u03c6\u03c6 means \u03c6(8) \u03c6(8) + \u03c6(1) \u03c6(1) under the Z2 invariance. However, in order to give mei \u221d h\u03c6ii i2 ,\nwhat we want is not \u03c6(8) \u03c6(8) + \u03c6(1) \u03c6(1) , but \u03c6(8) \u03c6(8) + \u03c6(1) \u03c6(1) + \u03c6(8) \u03c6(1) + \u03c6(1) \u03c6(8) . In order to\nevade this problem, we introduce additional fields \u03be (+) and \u03be (\u2212) whose Z2 parity are +1 and \u22121,\nrespectively. The effective interactions in the charged lepton sector are given by\nye\nHeef f = \u221a \u0113iL (\u03c6d )ji (\u03c6d )kj (\u03be (+) + \u03be (\u2212) )eRk ,\n2\n\n(4.2)\n\nwhere we have dropped the Higgs scalar HLd since we discuss flavor structure only. The expression\n(4.2) becomes\nye\n(1) (8)\n(8) (1)\n(1) (1)\n(8) (8)\nHeef f = \u221a \u0113L [(\u03c6d \u03c6d + \u03c6d \u03c6d )\u03be (+) + (\u03c6d \u03c6d + \u03c6d \u03c6d )\u03be (\u2212) ]eR .\n2\n\n(4.3)\n\nSince we have assumed that \u03be (+) and \u03be (\u2212) appear symmetrically in the theory, we also assume\nh\u03be (+) i = h\u03be (\u2212) i \u2261 v\u03be .\nThen, we obtain the effective Hamiltonian for the charged leptons\ny e vd v\u03be X i\n(8+1) i 2\nHeef f = \u221a\n\u0113L h(\u03c6d\n)i i eRi ,\n2\u039b3 i\n\n(4.4)\n\n(4.5)\n\nwhere vd = hHLd0 i. Since the fields (\u03c6d )ii are defined by Eq.(2.2), we can obtain the charged\nlepton mass relation (1.1) from the VEV relation (1.6).\nHowever, the present mechanism to obtain mei \u221d h\u03c6ii i2 is somewhat artificial. The present\nmechanism will be improved in the future model. [Of course, there is a possibility that the\nsuperpotential (2.3) must exactly be invariance under the Z2 symmetry, but the effective Hamiltonian (4.1) does not need to be invariance under the Z2 symmetry. Then, we can consider a\nmodel without \u03be (\u00b1) .]\n(b) Neutrino sector\nIn the present model, the right-handed neutrinos \u03bd (\u00b1) are singlets of SU(3). Therefore, in\nthe neutrino seesaw mass matrix M\u03bd = m\u03bdL MR\u22121 (m\u03bdL )T , MR is a 1 \u00d7 1 matrix and m\u03bdL is a 3 \u00d7 1\nmatrix. In order to compensate for the absence of the conventional triplet neutrinos \u03bdR , a new\nscalar \u03c7 which is a triplet of SU(3) has been introduced. The neutrino Dirac mass terms are\ngiven by the following effective Hamiltonian\nef f\nHDirac\n= y\u03bd\n\nvu i\n(\u2212)\n(+)\n\u03bd\u0304L h(\u03c6u )ji ih\u03c7j i(\u03bdR + \u03bdR ),\n2\n\u039b\n\n(4.6)\n\nwhere vu = hHLu0 i. It is likely that the scalar potential V (\u03c7) for the SU(3) triplet \u03c7 has a specific\nVEV solution\nh\u03c71 i = h\u03c72 i = h\u03c73 i \u2261 v\u03c7 .\n(4.7)\n\n\fWhen we assume the VEVs (4.7), we obtain\n\nef f\nHDirac\n\n\uf8f9\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0\nv\u03b7\nvu v\u03c7\n\uf8f7 (+) \uf8fa\n\uf8f7 (\u2212) \uf8ec\n\uf8ef\uf8ec\n= y\u03bd \u221a\n(\u03bd\u0304\u03b7 \u03bd\u0304\u03c3 \u03bd\u0304\u03c0 )L \uf8f0\uf8ed 0 \uf8f8 \u03bdR + \uf8ed v\u03c3 \uf8f8 \u03bdR \uf8fb ,\n2\n2\u039b\n0\nv\u03c0\n\uf8ee\uf8eb\n\n(4.8)\n\nwhere va = h\u03c6ua i (a = \u03c0, \u03b7, \u03c3) (for convenience, we have dropped the index u). Therefore, we\nobtain the effective neutrino mass matrix on the (\u03b7, \u03c3, \u03c0) basis,\n\nUTTB M\u03bd UT B \u2261 M\u03bd(\u03b7\u03c3\u03c0) =\n\n1\n(\u2212)\n\nMR\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nv\u03b72 0 v\u03c0 v\u03b7\n0 0 0\n1 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n0\n0 \uf8f8 + (+) \uf8ed 0 v\u03c32 0 \uf8f8 ,\n\uf8ed 0\nMR\nv\u03c0 v\u03b7 0 v\u03c02\n0 0 0\n\uf8eb\n\n(4.9)\n\n\u221a\n(\u00b1)\n(\u00b1)\nwhere MR = yR h\u03a6R i, and we have dropped the common factors (y\u03bd vu v\u03c7 / 2\u039b2 )2 . By the\nway, the ratio v\u03c0 /v\u03b7 cannot be determined from the potential (2.6), and the ratio is determined\nby a soft S4 symmetry breaking term WSB which has been discussed in the previous section.\nWe can choose a solution v\u03c0 = 0 in the superpotential W (\u03c6u ) by adjusting the parameter \u03b2\nin WSB , differently from the case of W (\u03c6d ). Then, the neutrino mass matrix (4.9) becomes a\n(+)\n(\u2212)\ndiagonal form D\u03bd = (1/MR )diag(v\u03b72 , 0, 0) + (1/MR )diag(0, v\u03c32 , 0). Since the mass matrix M\u03bd\non the (\u03bd1 , \u03bd2 , \u03bd3 ) = (\u03bde , \u03bd\u03bc , \u03bd\u03c4 ) basis is given by\nM\u03bd = UT B M\u03bd(\u03b7\u03c3\u03c0) UTTB = UT B D\u03bd UTTB ,\n\n(4.10)\n\nwe can obtain the tribimaximal mixing\nU\u03bd = UT B ,\n\n(4.11)\n\nm\u03bd1 = kv\u03b72 , m\u03bd2 = kv\u03c32 , m\u03bd3 = 0,\n\n(4.12)\n\nand the neutrino masses\n(+)\n\n(\u2212)\n\nfor the case of MR = MR \u2261 MR , where k = (y\u03bd vu v\u03c7 )2 /2MR \u039b4 and (\u03bd\u03b7 , \u03bd\u03c3 , \u03bd\u03c0 ) has been\nrenamed (\u03bd1 , \u03bd2 , \u03bd3 ) according to the conventional naming.\nHowever, since we have taken v\u03c0 = 0, the value of v\u03b7 satisfies v\u03b72 = v\u03c32 from the relation\n(1.5), so that the result (4.12) gives m\u03bd1 = m\u03bd2 . The observed value [14] \u2206m2solar is small, but\nit is not zero. Therefore, we must consider a small deviation between the first and second terms\n(+)\n(\u2212)\n(\u2212)\n(+)\nin (4.9) (i.e. MR 6= MR ). Since the value MR /MR is free in the present model, we cannot\npredict an explicit value of the ratio \u2206m2solar /\u2206m2atm .\nSince the present model gives an inverse hierarchy of the neutrino masses, the predicted\neffective electron neutrino mass\n\nhm\u03bde i =\n\nX\ni\n\n2\nUei\nm\u03bdi\n\n\u2243 |m\u03bd1 | \u2243 |m\u03bd2 | \u2243\n\nq\n\n\u22122\n\u2206m2atm = 5.23+0.25\neV,\n\u22120.40 \u00d7 10\n\n(4.13)\n\n\f\u22123 eV2 . This value (4.13) is sufficiently\nwhere we have used the value [15] \u2206m2atm = 2.74+0.44\n\u22120.26 \u00d710\nsensitive to the next generation experiments of the neutrinoless double beta decay.\n\n5 Summary\nIn conclusion, on the basis of the S4 symmetry which is embedded into SU(3), we have\ninvestigated a lepton mass model with the effectuve Hamiltonian of the Froggatt-Nielsen type\n(4.1). We have assumed that the singlet and doublet of S4 originate in the singlet and octet\nof SU(3), and we have obtained the VEV relation (1.5). In the derivation of the VEV relation\n(1.5), the essential assumptions for the superpotential W (\u03c6f ) are the following two: (i) the scalar\nfields \u03c6f always appear in terms of the nonet form (2.1) of U(3); (ii) the superpotential W (\u03c6f ) is\ninvariant under the Z2 transformation (2.5). Then, we have obtained not only the VEV relation\n(1.5), but also h(\u03c6(8) )ji i = 0 (i 6= j) for the other components of \u03c6(8) (i.e. h3i = h3\u2032 i = 0).\nIn the charged lepton secter, in order to give mei \u221d h(\u03c6d )ii i2 , we have assumed new scalars\n\u03be (\u00b1) . Although it has been reuired to compensate for the Z2 invariance, the model seems to\nleave the door open to further improvement.\n\nFor the neutrino sector, we have obtained the tribimaximal mixing (1.2) by introducing an\n(\u00b1)\nSU(3) triplet scalar \u03c7 and the two SU(3) singlet right-handed neutrinos \u03bdR in addition to the\n(\u00b1)\nnonet scalar \u03c6u . In the present model, the right-handed neutrinos \u03bdR are singlets of SU(3),\n(\u00b1)\nthe Majorana neutrino mass matrices MR have no flavor structure. For the neutrino mass\n(\u2212)\n(+)\nspectrum, since the model gives m\u03bd1 = m\u03bd2 in the limit of MR = MR , we must consider a\n(+)\n(\u2212)\n(\u2212)\n(+)\nsmall deviation MR 6= MR . Since the value of MR /MR is a free parameter in the present\nmodel, we cannot predict the value \u2206m2solar /\u2206m2atm at present, although the smallness of the\nratio \u2206m2solar /\u2206m2atm can be understood. Since the present model gives an inverse hierarchy of\nthe neutrino masses, we can predict the effective electron neutrino mass hm\u03bde i \u2243 0.05 eV, which\nis sufficiently sensitive to the next generation experiments of the neutrinoless double beta decay.\nThe present model seems to provide suggestive hints on seeking for a model which leads to\nthe tribimaximal mixing (1.2) and the charged lepton mass relation (1.1), although the model\nhas still many points which should be improved. At the same time, the model will provide a\nclue to the quark mass matrix model from a point of unified view of the quarks and leptons.\nThe extension of the present model to the quark mass matrix model will be given elsewhere.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe author would like to thank E.
