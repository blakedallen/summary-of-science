R. China\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nConformally flat manifolds are manifolds which have atlases whose transition\nfunctions are M\u00f6bius transformations. From the viewpoint of Liouville's theorem (see, e.g., [6]) which states that the set of conformal maps in Rn is reduced\nto that of M\u00f6bius transformations for all n \u2265 3, this class of manifolds can\nbe regarded as higher dimensional generalizations of Riemann surfaces. Those\nthat are further endowed with a spinor structure, are called conformally flat\nspin manifolds. These are studied by many authors. See for instance [10, 5]\namong others.\nOne aspect of study in connection with this class of manifolds is the study\nof boundary value problems of PDE's and related operators. For many classical two-dimensional boundary value problems, the complex Cauchy-Riemann\noperator pervades much of modern analytic techniques which further could be\ncarried over to the context of two dimensional Riemann surfaces.\nFor the treatment of their higher dimensional analogues, the less known Euclidean Dirac operator plays a similarly powerful key role. As it is the linearization of the Euclidean Laplace operator, it can successfully be applied to a number of boundary value problems which arise from classical harmonic analysis,\nfor instance the Dirichlet problem. We refer the interested reader for example\nto [16, 17, 20, 23, 24]. In recent decades, the term Clifford analysis has been\nused to describe the study of applications of Dirac operators in analysis. In\nparticular, during the previous ten years much effort has been made to extend\nClifford analysis from the context of Euclidean spaces to that of general Riemannian manifolds, see for example [4, 6, 21]. Results in this direction include\nCauchy type integral formulas and Plemelj projection formulas. However, in the\ngeneral context of Riemannian manifolds little in the way of explicit formulas\nhas been developed so far.\nFor a number of examples of conformally flat spin manifolds, much progress\nobtaining explicit formulas like Cauchy kernels and Green's formulas has been\nmade very recently [32, 19, 14, 15, 29]. This paper provides a continuation as\nwell as an extension of the recent works [14, 15, 29]. In particular, we introduce a\nCauchy integral formula for hypermonogenic functions on cylinders, tori and on\nthe Hopf manifold. Hypermonogenic functions are solutions to a Dirac-Hodge\ntype equation with respect to the hyperbolic metric.\nWe also develop generalizations of the Mittag-Leffler theorem and the Laurent\nexpansion theorem for cylindrical and toroidal monogenic functions. The study\nof Hardy space decompositions on the Hopf manifold is also extended. In particular, Kerzman-Stein operators are introduced and we give explicit formulas\nfor the Szeg\u00f6 kernel, the Bergman kernel and the Poisson kernel of half the Hopf\nmanifold. We conclude by outlining some first rudiments for a function theory\non conformally flat manifolds of genus g \u2265 2, such as Pretzel type manifolds\nand, more generally, k-handled tori and k-handled polycylinders.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nPreliminaries\n\nWe start by introducing some basic notions and notations on real Clifford algebras over the Euclidean space Rn . For particular details we refer the interested\nreader for example to [22, 3]. Throughout this paper, {e1 , . . . , en } denotes the\nstandard orthonormal basis in the Euclidean space Rn and Cln is its real Clifford\nalgebra in which the relation ei ej + ej ei = \u22122\u03b4ij holds. This relation endows\nthe Euclidian vector space Rn with a multiplicative structure: Each vector\nx \u2208 Rn \\{0} has an inverse element, given by \u2212x/kxk2 . The reversion antie = b\u0303\u00e3, e \u0303i = ei for all i = 1, 2, . . . , n.\nautomorphism is defined by the relations ab\nThe conjugation anit-automorphism is given by ab = b a, ei = \u2212ei for all\ni = 1, . . . , n. We further need the automorphism \u2217 : Cln \u2192 Cln which is defined\nby the relations: e\u2217n = \u2212en , e\u2217i = ei for i = 0, 1, . . . , n \u2212 1 and (ab)\u2217 = a\u2217 b\u2217 .\nLet U \u2286 Rn be an open set. A real differentiable function f : U \u2192 Cln which\n\u2202\n\u2202\ne1 + \u2202x\ne2 + * * * + \u2202x\u2202 n en\nsatisfies Df = 0, resp. f D = 0, where D := \u2202x\n1\n2\nis the Euclidean Dirac operator, is called left (resp. right) monogenic or left\n(resp. right) Clifford-holomorphic. Due to non-commutativity, both classes of\nfunctions do not coincide with each other; however, for both classes an analogous\nfunction theory can be established, see e.g. [3] or elsewhere. The left and right\nfundamental solution to the D-operator is called the Euclidean Cauchy kernel\nx\u2212y\nwhich has the form G(x \u2212 y) = kx\u2212yk\nThe Dirac operator factorizes the\nn.\nPn \u2202 2\n2\nEuclidean Laplacian \u2206 = j=1 \u2202x2 , viz D = \u2212\u2206 whose fundamental solution\nj\n\n1\nis the Green's kernel given by H(x \u2212 y) = kx\u2212yk\nn\u22122 , whenever n \u2265 3. Every\nreal component of a monogenic function is hence harmonic.\nIn contrast to complex analysis, the set of left (right) monogenic functions is\nnot endowed with a ring structure. It forms only a right (left) Cln -module.\nIn general, the composition of two monogenic functions does not result into\na monogenic function, either. However, both the D-operator as well as the\nLaplacian is left quasi-invariant under M\u00f6bius transformations. Following for\nexample [1, 7], M\u00f6bius transformations in Rn can be represented in the way\nT : Rn \u222a {\u221e} \u2192 Rn \u222a {\u221e}, T (x) = (ax + b)(cx + d)\u22121 with coefficients a, b, c, d\nfrom Cln that can all be written as products of vectors from Rn and that satisfy\nad \u0303 \u2212 bc\u0303 \u2208 Rn \\{0} and a\u22121 b, c\u22121 d \u2208 Rn if c 6= 0 or a 6= 0, respectively. These\nconditions are often called Vahlen conditions.\nNow assume that M (x) is a M\u00f6bius transformation represented in the above\nmentioned form. If f is a left monogenic (harmonic) function in the variable\ny = M (x) = (ax + b)(cx + d)\u22121 , then, [25], the function J1 (M, x)f (M (x)),\nresp. J2 (M, x)f (M (x)) is again left-monogenic (harmonic) in the variable x.\ng stands for the monogenic conformal weight factor\nHere, J (M, x) = cx+d\n1\n\nand J2 (M, x) =\n\nkcx+dkn\n1\nkcx+dkn\u22122\n\nfor the harmonic conformal weight factor. The set\n\u0012\n\u0013\na b\nthat consists of Clifford valued matrices\nwhose coefficients satisfy\nc d\nthe above mentioned conditions, is called the general Vahlen group GV (Rn )\nwhich generalizes SL(2, C) to the higher dimensional context. The conformal\n\n3\n\n\finvariance holds of course also for all subgroups of GV (Rn ). The particular\nsubgroup SV (Rn ) = {M \u2208 GV (Rn ) | ad \u0303 \u2212 bc\u0303 = 1} is called the special Vahlen\ngroup and is purely generated by the inversion matrix and translation type\nmatrices, as proved for instance in [7]. Its subgroup SV (Rn\u22121 ) has the special\nproperty that it acts transitively on the upper half-space H + (Rn ) = {x \u2208\nRn xn > 0}. In view of this property, all M\u00f6bius transformations associated to\nthe group SV (Rn\u22121 ) (as well as of all its subgroups) T (x) = (ax + b)(cx + d) are\nwell defined for each x \u2208 H + (Rn ) and M (x) itself is an element from H + (Rn )\nfor each x \u2208 H + (Rn ). Therefore, if f is a function that is left monogenic on\nthe whole half-space in the variable x, then J1 (M, x)f (M (x)) is so, too for all\nx \u2208 H + (Rn ). Similarly, for harmonic function, involving J2 (M, x) instead.\nIn this paper we also want to consider hypermonogenic functions. These are\nnull-solutions to the hyperbolic Dirac operator Dh := xn Df (x)+nSc(\u2212en f )(x) =\n0, where (xn 6= 0). The solutions to this system are called hyperbolic monogenic functions or often simply hypermonogenic functions for short. One of\nthe first to study this system extensively was H. Leutwiler in 1992 [18]. A\nCauchy kernel function for hypermonogenic functions in the upper half-space\nhas been set up recently by S.L. Eriksson in [9]. Following, e.g., [11], also the\nhyperbolic D-operator shows a conformal invariance behavior: If f is left hypermonogenic\nin the variable y := (ax + b)(cx + d)\u22121 , where we assume that\n\u0012\n\u0013\na b\n \u0303\n\u2208 SV (Rn\u22121 ) then F (x) := (cx + d)\u22121 f ((ax + b)(cx + d)\u22121 )(xc\u0303 + d)\nc d\nturns out to be a left hypermonogenic in the variable x.\n\n3\n\nMonogenic, harmonic and hypermonogenic functions and some boundary value problems\n\nIn this section we continue with the development of the rudiments of Clifford\nanalysis, harmonic analysis and modified Clifford analysis on some particular\nexamples of conformally flat spin manifolds that arise from factoring out a\nsimply-connected domain U \u2286 Rn by discontinuous subgroups \u0393 of the Vahlen\ngroup GV (Rn ). A general description of all discrete subgroups of the Vahlen\ngroup is given in [8] while in particular all congruence groups of the special\nhypercomplex modular group \u0393p (its definition will be recalled in Section 3.3)\nare treated in [13]. Readers who are not familiar with monogenic and harmonic\nspinor sections can find detailed information in [25].\nLet M be such a conformally flat manifold constructed by M = U/\u0393, with\nU, \u0393 as above. In all that follows U \u2286 Rn is the universal covering space of\nthe manifold M . As a consequence, there exists a well-defined projection map\np : U \u2192 M, x 7\u2192 x (mod \u0393). Let us write for each x \u2208 U for the image\nunder the projection x\u2032 = p(x). Consequently, for each open set Q \u2286 Rn we\nwrite Q\u2032 = p(Q). In this way \u0393-invariant functions give rise to functions on M .\nFunctions, that show an invariance behavior under the action of a discrete group\nare called automorphic functions. More generally one speaks of automorphic\nforms, when having a group invariance up to an elementary factor.\n4\n\n\fFor the classical theory of analytic automorphic forms in one complex variable, see for example [31]. For the basic theory of monogenic, harmonic and\npolymonogenic automorphic forms on general discrete subgroups of the Vahlen\ngroup we refer the interested reader to [12] and to [13]. Here in this paper,\nwe explain how particular prototypes from this hypercomplex analytic type of\nautomorphic forms can be used to tackle boundary value problems from Clifford\nand harmonic analysis on three particular families of spin manifolds that are\nconstructed in this way. What follows provides an extension of our recent papers [14, 15] in which we produced some first fundamental steps in this direction.\nIn particular we also develop some first results in the context of hypermonogenic\nfunctions.\n\n3.1\n\nHopf Type Manifolds\n\nBasic Background. Here, U = Rn \\{0} and \u0393 = {mk : k \u2208 Z} with an\narbitrary but fixed m \u2208 N with m > 1. We consider one family of spinor bundles\nF1,m , m \u2208 N over S 1 \u00d7 S n\u22121 \u223c\n= U/\u0393, making the identification (x, X) \u21d0\u21d2\n(mk x, mk(n\u22121)/2 X) for every k \u2208 Z where x \u2208 Rn \\{0} and X \u2208 Cln . By the\nidentification (x, X) \u21d0\u21d2 (mk x, mk(n\u22122)/2 X) a further family of spinor bundles,\nsay F2,m is constructed. The first family gives rise to monogenic spinor sections\nand the second one with harmonic sections on these manifolds. Monogenic and\nharmonic functions on the associated Hopf type manifolds can be constructed\nfrom monogenic and harmonic automorphic forms that transform under the\ndiscrete dilatation group \u0393 = {mk , l \u2208 Z} in the following way:\nf (x) = mk(n\u2212j)/2 f (mk x)\n\nj = 1, 2.\n\n(1)\n\nIn [15] explicit Cauchy (Green) formulae for such monogenic (harmonic) functions on the Hopf manifold have been developed. As these provide the starting\npoint for the following investigation, we briefly quote them for convenience:\nTheorem 1 Let V \u2032 be a domain in S 1 \u00d7S n\u22121 . Suppose also that S \u2032 is a strongly\nLipschitz hypersurface in V \u2032 and that S \u2032 bounds a subdomain W \u2032 and within W \u2032\nthe domain W \u2032 is contractable to a point. Then for each y \u2032 \u2208 W \u2032 and each left\nClifford holomorphic section f \u2032 : V \u2032 \u2192 F1,m we have\nZ\n1\nG\u2032 H (x\u2032 , y \u2032 )dp(n(x))f \u2032 (x\u2032 )d\u03c3 \u2032 (x\u2032 ).\n(2)\nf \u2032 (y \u2032 ) =\n\u03c9n S \u2032\n\nHere, \u03c9n stands for the surface area of S n , n(x) the unit outer normal vector\nto S := p\u22121 (S \u2032 ) at x := p\u22121 (x\u2032 ) and dp for the derivative of p.\nHere, G\u2032 H is the image of the function\nGH (x, y) =\n\n0\nX\n\nk=\u2212\u221e\n\n\u221e\nhX\ni\nmk(n\u22121)/2 G(mk x\u2212y)+G(x)\nmk(1\u2212n)/2 G(m\u2212k x\u22121 \u2212y \u22121 ) G(y),\nk=1\n\n5\n\n\funder the projection map p which is exactly the \u0393-periodization of the Euclidean\nCauchy kernel function, transforming in the way (1).\nUnder the same conditions, each harmonic section f \u2032 : V \u2032 \u2192 F2,m satisfies\nf \u2032 (y \u2032 ) =\n\n1\n\u03c9n\n\nZ h\n\nS\u2032\n\ni\nHH (x\u2032 , y \u2032 )dp(n(x))f \u2032 (x\u2032 )+ GH (x\u2032 , y \u2032 )dp(n(x))DH f \u2032 (x\u2032 ) d\u03c3 \u2032 (x\u2032 )\n\n(3)\nwhere HH is deduced from GH just by replacing the Euclidean Cauchy kernel\nfunction G(x) by the harmonic one H(x).\nKerzman-Stein operators.\nLet us next suppose that S \u2032 is such a strongly Lipschitz hypersurface with these\nproperties, dividing the Hopf manifold S 1 \u00d7 S n\u22121 into two disjoint domains, say\nS \u2032+ and S \u2032\u2212 . From the Cauchy (Green) formulas that we set up, one can now\ndirectly calculate Plemelj projection operators for Lp (S \u2032 ) = {\u03b8 : S \u2032 \u2192 Fj :\nk\u03b8kLp < \u221e} where 1 < p < \u221e. As shown in our previous work [15], under\nthese conditions one obtains the usual Hardy space decomposition of the form\nLp (S \u2032 ) = H p (S \u2032+ ) \u2295 H p (S \u2032\u2212 ) in this context.\nThis admits us now to carry over the standard Kerzman-Stein theory from\nthe Euclidean context (see for instance [2] and elsewhere) to the framework of\nHopf manifolds in an explicit way. To go into detail, let us denote the Cauchytransform by H\u2032 := 12 I + CS \u2032 . Adapting the calculations from [2] to the context\nof Hopf manifolds, one arrives at the following explicit formula for the Lp (S \u2032 )\nadjoint of the Cauchy-transform\nZ\n1\n1\nH\u2032 \u03b7 \u2032 (w\u2032 ) := \u03b7 \u2032 (w\u2032 ) +\nP.V. dp(n(w))G\u2032 H (x\u2032 , w\u2032 )\u03b7 \u2032 (x\u2032 )d\u03c3(x\u2032 ).\n2\n\u03c9n\nS\u2032\n\nThe adjoint Cauchy-transform H\u2032 \u03b7 \u2032 (u\u2032 ) also turns out to be Lp (S \u2032 ) bounded.\nNow it is natural to introduce the Kerzman-Stein operator on the Hopf manifold\nby\nZ\n1\n\u2217\nA\u2032 \u03b7 \u2032 (w\u2032 ) := [H\u2032 \u2212 H\u2032 ]\u03b7 \u2032 (w\u2032 ) :=\nA(x\u2032 , w\u2032 )\u03b7 \u2032 (x\u2032 )d\u03c3(x\u2032 ),\n\u03c9n\nS\u2032\n\nintroducing the Kerzman-Stein kernel as\nA(x\u2032 , w\u2032 ) := G\u2032 H (x\u2032 , w\u2032 )(dp(n(x))) \u2212 dp(n(w))G\u2032 H (x\u2032 , w\u2032 ).\nSince S \u2032 has a Lipschitz boundary, we thus can readily adapt the argument\nfrom [2], Lemma 4.5, to the context of the Hopf manifold, and thus, we can\nestablish that the operator I +A\u2032 is invertible on Lp (S \u2032 ). This has an important\nconsequence. We can hence write the Szeg\u00f6 projection P \u2032 on the space Lp (S \u2032 ),\nS \u2032 being a subdomain of the Hopf manifold with a strongly Lipschitz boundary,\nin the way\nP \u2032 = H\u2032 (I + A\u2032 ).\n\n6\n\n\fNotice that the Szeg\u00f6 kernel is different from domain to domain, and it is very\ndifficult to determine it explicitly for a given domain S \u2032 . However, the Cauchy\nkernel is always the same, namely G\u2032 H on the Hopf manifold, independent of\nwhich domain S \u2032 is considered. Since we have an explicit expression for G\u2032 H\nwe can hence compute the Szeg\u00f6 projection with this formula, without knowing\nthe Szeg\u00f6 kernel function. We can say more. In many cases, as for instance\nin cases when S \u2032 is topologically similar to p(\u2202B), B denoting a ball in Rn ,\nthis formula provides simpler numerical methods to determine the Szeg\u00f6 kernel\nof S \u2032 , than to determine it directly, for example by applying a Gram-Schmidt\nalgorithm which is numerically very instable.\nSzeg\u00f6 kernel, Bergman kernel, and Poisson kernel of half the Hopf\nmanifold.\nLet us now focus on the particular decomposition, considering exactly half the\nHopf manifold arising from the factorization H + (Rn )/{mk , k \u2208 Z} which shall\nbe denoted by S+ in what follows. Hence we are in a particular situation of\nthe general one considered so far. For S+ we can readily establish a closed and\nexplicit formula for the Szeg\u00f6 kernel, and, also for the Poisson kernel and the\nSzeg\u00f6 kernel; one can carry over the known formulas for the kernel functions of\nthe upper half-space H + (Rn ) [6] to the context considered here by using the\nexplicit representation formulas for the Cauchy kernel of the Hopf manifold. The\nSzeg\u00f6 kernel S(x\u2032 , w\u2032 ) of S+ thus turns out to be G\u2032 H (x\u2032 , w\u2032 )dp(x)|x=en where\nx\u2032 \u2208 \u2202S+ and w\u2032 \u2208 S+ . The Poisson kernel is twice the real part of the Szeg\u00f6\nkernel: P (x\u2032 , w\u2032 ) = 2Sc(S(x\u2032 , w\u2032 )). In fact this also follows readily from the\nPlemelj projection formulas that we developed in the previous subsection. This\nPoisson kernel then solves the Dirichlet problem for harmonic functions on S+\nwith given Lp data (1 < p < \u221e) on the boundary \u2202S+ . By similar arguments\nas presented in [6], we can further infer that the Bergman kernel B(x\u2032 , w\u2032 ) for\nL2 -integrable monogenic functions on S+ is given by 2 \u2202x\u2202 \u2032 S(x\u2032 , w\u2032 ). Finally, the\nn\nBergman kernel for harmonic functions on S+ turns out to be the real part of\nthe monogenic Bergman kernel function B(x\u2032 , w\u2032 ).\nHypermonogenic kernels.\nLet us now turn to also establish a Cauchy-integral formula for hypermonogenic\nn\nfunctions on half the Hopf manifold S+ = H R /{mk , k \u2208 Z}. To proceed in\nthis direction we now need to work with the hypermonogenic kernels [9]\np1 (x, y) :=\n\n(x \u2212 y)\u22121\nkx \u2212 ykn\u22122 kx \u2212 y \u2217 kn\u22122\n\np2 (x, y) :=\n\n(x\u2217 \u2212 y)\u22121\nkx \u2212 ykn\u22122 kx\u2217 \u2212 ykn\u22122\n\nand\n\nwhich provide the adequate analogous of the function G(x\u2212 y) in the hyperbolic\ndx2 +***+dx2\nsetting adapted to the hyperbolic metric ds2 = 1 dx2 n . In order to set up\nn\na Cauchy kernel for hypermonogenic functions on S+ we next define the two\n\n7\n\n\fbasic hypermonogenic series\nh1 (x, y) =\n\n0\nX\n\nmk/2 p1 (mk x, y) + x\u22121\n\nk=\u2212\u221e\n\n\u221e\nhX\n\ni\nm\u2212k/2 p1 (m\u2212k x\u22121 , y \u22121 ) y \u22121 ,\n\n\u221e\nhX\n\ni\nm\u2212k/2 p2 (m\u2212k x\u22121 , y \u22121 ) y \u22121 .\n\nk=1\n\nand\nh2 (x, y) =\n\n0\nX\n\nmk/2 p2 (mk x, y) + x\u22121\n\nk=\u2212\u221e\n\nk=1\n\nThese then are the \u0393-periodizations of the Euclidean hypermonogenic Cauchy\nkernel functions. They hence induce the hypermonogenic Cauchy kernel functions on the S+ , simply by projecting them down. This allows us to carry over\nthe Cauchy integral formula from the standard setting established in [9] to the\ncontext of the Hopf manifold in the following form\nTheorem 2 Suppose that U \u2032 \u2282 S+ is an open set and that K \u2032 \u2282 U is a domain\nwith a Lipschitz boundary S \u2032 . Let f : U \u2032 \u2282 Fh,m be a left hypermonogenic\nfunction, where Fh,m stands for the hypermonogenic section. Then\nf \u2032 (y \u2032 ) =\n\u2212\n\nn\u22122 Z\n2n\u22122 yn\u2032\nh\u2032 1 (x\u2032 , y \u2032 )dp(n(x))f \u2032 (x\u2032 )d\u03c3(x)\n\u03c9n\nS\u2032\nZ\nh\u2032 2 (x\u2032 , y \u2032 )dp(n(x))\u2217 f \u2217 (x\u2032 )d\u03c3(x\u2032 )\n\nS\u2032\n\nFrom this formula one can then depart to introduce analogous Plemelj projection operators and to establish a Kerzman-Stein theory for hypermonogenic\nfunctions. This can be done in complete analogy to the monogenic case, so that\nwe leave it to the reader as a simple exercise.\n\n3.2\n\nConformally Flat Cylinders and Tori\n\nBasic Background. Here, U = Rn and \u0393 is the discrete translation group\n\u0013E\n\u0013\n\u0012\nD\u0012\n1 \u03c9k\n1 \u03c91\n,***\nT (\u03a9k ) =\n0 1\n0 1\nwhere \u03c91 , . . . , \u03c9k are R-linear independent vectors (k < n) spanning a k-dimensional\nlattice Z\u03c91 + * * * + Z\u03c9k . As explained in our previous work [15], the decomposition of the lattice \u03a9k into the direct sum of the sublattices \u03a9l := Z\u03c91 + * * *+ Z\u03c9l\nand \u03a9k\u2212l := Z\u03c9l+1 + * * * + Z\u03c9l gives rise to k conformally inequivalent different spinor bundles E (l) on Ck \u223c\n= Rn /T (\u03a9k ) by making the identification\nm1 +...+ml\nX) with x \u2208 Rn , X \u2208 Cln . Monogenic,\n(x, X) \u21d0\u21d2 (x + m + n, (\u22121)\nharmonic and hypermonogenic functions on the associated manifolds can be obtained by applying the projection map p : Rn \u2192 Rn /T (\u03a9k ) \u223c\n= Ck on monogenic,\n8\n\n\fresp. harmonic, resp. hypermonogenic functions that are automorphic functions\non the associated discrete translation group T (\u03a9k ). Examples of monogenic\nand harmonic automorphic functions on T (\u03a9k ) are for instance the generalized Eisenstein type series whose basic properties are described in detail in [12],\nChapter 2. They hence induce examples of monogenic and harmonic functions\non cylinders and tori via the projection map. In our previous works [14, 15]\nexplicit formulas for the Cauchy kernel on Ck in terms of particular variants\nof generalized Eisenstein type series have been established. Following [15], for\nthe cylinders Ck with k < n \u2212 1 with the spinor bundles E (l) , (l \u2264 k), the\nCauchy kernel functions are induced by the following variants of the generalized\nmonogenic cotangent functions\nX\ncot1,k,l (x, y) =\n(4)\n(\u22121)m1 +***+ml G(x + m + n)\nm\u2208\u03a9l ,n\u2208\u03a9k\u2212l\n\nand\ncot2,k,l (x, y) =\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)m1 +***+ml H(x + m + n).\n\n(5)\n\nm\u2208\u03a9l ,n\u2208\u03a9k\u2212l\n\nThese variants of the monogenic cotangent series are the T (\u03a9p )-periodizations\nof the Euclidean Cauchy kernel, adapted according to the underlying spinor\nstructure of the associated Ck . Notice, these series only converge normally for\np < n \u2212 1. In the case k = n \u2212 1 this construction can easily be adapted by\ncoupling antipodal lattice points together. Due to the non-existence of n-fold\nperiodic monogenic functions with only one point singularity of the order of the\nCauchy kernel per period cell, one then needs to adapt this construction in the\ncase k = n in the way involving two point singularities a and b (incongruent\nmodulo \u03a9n ). For details, and the precise definition of the toroidal monogenic\ncotangent function cot1,k,l;a,b (x, y) see [15]. If we replace in the representation\nof cot1,k,l (x, y) the Euclidean kernel function G by the harmonic kernel H, then\none gets the corresponding Green kernel functions, denoted by cot2,k,l (x, y) for\ncylindrical harmonic functions. However, notice that the convergence abscissa of\nthe harmonic analogous of these monogenic cotangent type functions (replacing\nG by H in the series) is one less than in the monogenic case. This implies that\nthe construction of the monogenic kernel function for the n-torus, only carries\nover to the n \u2212 1 cylinder in the harmonic context.\nHarmonic Green kernels on Cn expressed by Eisenstein type series\nA question that remained unsolved in our previous two papers is to ask whether\nthese constructions can further be extended to the case k = n in the context of\nharmonic functions. In this paper we finally set up a solution to this problem.\nTo get a harmonic n-fold periodic cotangent type series involving only poles\nof the order of the Euclidean Cauchy kernel, one first might think of trying a\nfurther coupling of antipodal lattice points. This however does not work here\nso easily, since the Euclidean harmonic Green's kernel is an even function and\nnot an odd one. Further minus signs hence cannot be generated by a further\ncoupling of antipodal points, since they are eliminated by the modulus. The\n\n9\n\n\fsolution to this problem is to take for mutually incongruent modulo \u03a9n points\na1 , a2 , a3 , a4 from Rn \\\u03a9n and to make the following construction\n\n:=\n\ncot1,n,l;a1 ,a2 ,a3 ,a4 (x, y)\nH(x \u2212 a1 ) + H(x \u2212 a2 ) + H(x \u2212 a3 ) + H(x \u2212 a4 )\nh\nX\n(\u22121)m1 +***+ml H(x \u2212 a1 + m + n) + H(\u2212a1 \u2212 m \u2212 n)\n+\nm\u2208\u039bl ,n\u2208\u039bk\u2212l\n\n+H(x \u2212 a2 + m + n) + H(\u2212a2 \u2212 m \u2212 n)\n\n\u2212H(x + a3 + m + n) \u2212 H(\u2212a3 \u2212 m \u2212 n)\ni\n\u2212H(x + a4 + m \u2212 n) \u2212 H(\u2212a4 \u2212 m \u2212 n) .\n\nHere, \u03a9+\nl = N \u03c91 + Z\u03c92 + * * * + Z\u03c9l \u222a N \u03c92 + Z\u03c93 + * * * + Z\u03c9l \u222a * * * \u222a N \u03c9l is the\npositive part of the lattice \u03a9l , according to the direct lattice decomposition\nas described in [12], Chapter 2. Its projection p(cot1,n,l;a1 ,a2 ,a3 ,a4 (x, y)) :=\ncot\u2032 1,n,l;a1 ,a2 ,a3 ,a4 (x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) induces then a local Green kernel on the torus which\nhas four isolated point singularities and one can set up a local Green's formula\nfor the torus.\nTheorem 3 Suppose that U \u2032 is a domain in Cn and that f \u2032 : U \u2032 \u2192 Cln is\nannihilated by the toriodal Laplace operator D\u2032 = p(\u2206) in U \u2032 . Suppose also that\nV \u2032 is a subdomain of U \u2032 whose closure also lies in U \u2032 and V \u2032 has a strongly\nLipschitz boundary. Furthermore a2 , a3 , a4 do not belong to the closure of Va\u20321 .\nThen for each y \u2032 \u2208 V \u2032\nZ\n1\n(6)\ncot\u20321,n,l;a1 ,a2 ,a3 ,a4 (x\u2032 , ya\u2032 1 )(dpn n(x))F \u2032 (x\u2032 )d\u03c3 \u2032 (x\u2032 )\nf \u2032 (y \u2032 ) =\n\u03c9n \u2202Va\u2032\n1\n\nwhere ya\u2032 1 = p(y \u2212 a1 ).\nMittag-Leffler and Laurent expansion theorems for cylindrical and\ntoroidal functions.\nNext we give a generalization of Mittag-Leffler's theorem and the Laurent\nexpansion theorem in the context of cylinders and tori. To this end, we now have\nadditionally to also consider the partial derivatives of the cotangent functions.\nAccording to [12] Chapter 2.1, these partial derivatives represent the higher\ndimensional monogenic and harmonic analogous of the translative Eisenstein\nseries of higher pole order. We shall see that they will play the analogous role\nof the partial derivatives of the Euclidean Cauchy kernel in Mittag-Leffler type\nand Laurent expansion type theorems in the context of conformally flat cylinders\nand tori. Let us consider slightly more general the following variants\n\u01eb1,k,l,m (x) :=\n\n\u2202 m1 +***+mn\nmn cot1,k,l (x, 0)\n1\n\u2202xm\n1 * * * \u2202xn\n\n\u01eb2,k,l,m (x) :=\n\n\u2202 m1 +***+mn\nmn cot2,k,l (x, 0),\n1\n\u2202xm\n1 * * * \u2202xn\n\nand\n\n10\n\n\fadapted to the underlying spinor structure. These functions allow us to adapt\nthe standard Mittag-Leffler theorem from the Euclidean setting to the context\nof cylinders and tori with the particular spinor bundles under consideration in\nthe following form:\nTheorem 4 Let k \u2208 {1, . . . , k} Let a\u2032 1 , a\u2032 2 , . . . , a\u2032 p \u2208 Ck be a finite set of points.\nSuppose that f \u2032 : Ck \\{a\u2032 1 , . . . , a\u2032 k } \u2192 Ej be a cylindrical/toroidal left monogenic\n(harmonic) function which has atmost isolated poles at the points a\u2032 i of the order\nKi . Then there exists a cylindrical/toroidal left monogenic (harmonic) function\n\u03c6 : Ck \u2192 Ej such that\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nf (x ) =\n\np Ki \u2212(n\u22121)\nX\nX\ni=1\n\nm=0\n\nX\n\nm=m1 +m2 +***+mn\n\n\"\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n#\n\n(7)\n\n#\n\n(8)\n\n\u01eb 1,k,l,m (x \u2212 a i ) + \u03c6\u2032 (x\u2032 )\n\nin the monogenic case, or\nf \u2032 (x\u2032 ) =\n\np Ki \u2212(n\u22121)\nX\nX\ni=1\n\nm=0\n\nX\n\nm=m1 +m2 +***+mn\n\n\"\n\n\u01eb\u2032 2,k,l,m (x\u2032 \u2212 a\u2032 i ) + \u03c6\u2032 (x\u2032 )\n\nin the harmonic case, respectively. In the case k = n and m = 0 one takes\ncot1,n,l;ai ,b (x, 0) where b can be chosen arbitrarily such that b 6\u2208 \u03a9n and b 6\u2261 a\n(mod) \u03a9n . Similary, one proceeds in the harmonic case for k = n \u2212 1 with\nm = 0, and in the case k = n with m = 0 one takes cot1,n,l;ai ,b2 ,b3 ,b4 (x, 0),\nchosing b2 , b3 , b4 adequately.\nRemark: In the particular case of the n-torus Cn a special effect appears in\nthis context, which does not appear in the Euclidean case, neither in case of the\nother k-cylinders with k < n. In the particular case of the torus, the function\n\u03c6\u2032 (x\u2032 ) always reduces to a single constant. This is a consequence of the fact that\nthere are no non-constant entire monogenic (harmonic) n-fold periodic functions\nin Rn . A left toroidal monogenic (harmonic) function having at most isolated\nsingularities on the torus can thus be represented up to a Clifford constant by\na finite sum of the cotangent type series and a finite amount of their partial\nderivatives.\nSimilarly, one can also establish a Laurent expansion theorem for cylindrical/toroidal left monogenic (harmonic) functions. Their local behavior near an\nisolated singularity a\u2032 \u2208 Ck can be described in the form\nX\n\u01eb\u2032 j,k,l,m (x\u2032 \u2212 a\u2032 ) + \u03c6\u2032 (x\u2032 \u2212 a\u2032 ),\nf \u2032 (x\u2032 ) =\n|m|\u22650\n\nwhere \u03c6\u2032 (x\u2032 \u2212a\u2032 ) is a cylindrical/toroidal left monogenic (harmonic) function in a\nsufficiently small neighborhood around x\u2032 = a\u2032 , satisfying limx\u2032 \u2192a\u2032 \u03c6\u2032 (x\u2032 \u2212 a\u2032 ) =\n\u03c6\u2032 (0). In the particular case when there are no further singularities on Ck ,\nthis representation holds globally on Ck , whence we are in a special case of the\nprevious theorem. However, we have to keep in mind, that a left monogenic\n11\n\n\ftoroidal function must at least have two poles of order n \u2212 1 or at least a pole\nof higher order.\nHypermonogenic kernels.\nNext we want to establish integral formulas for hypermonogenic functions on\nthe cylinders Ck with k < n. To proceed in this direction we need to introduce\nhypermonogenic generalizations of the cotangent functions cot1,k,l . In view of\nthe conformal invariance of Dhyp , a hypermonogenic function f remains monogenic under all translations of the form f (z + \u03c9) whenever \u03c9 \u2208 Rn\u22121 . If \u03a9k\nis thus a lattice with the property Sc(\u2212en \u03a9k ) = 0, then all transformations of\nthe form f (z + \u03c9) with such lattice elements remain hypermonogenic. Due to\nthe condition Sc(\u2212en \u03a9k ) = 0 we need to restrict in this context to consider\nonly p-dimensional lattices with p < n. In view of the conformal invariance and\nWeierstrass convergence theorem, it is thus natural to introduce the hypermonogenic versions of the cot1,k,l functions as follows,\nX\nc1 (x, y) =\n(\u22121)m1 +***+ml p1 (x + m + n, y)\nm\u2208\u03a9+\n,n\u2208\u03a9\u2212\nl\nk\u2212l\n\nand\n\nX\n\nc2 (x, y) =\n\n(\u22121)m1 +***+ml p2 (x + m + n, y),\n\n,n\u2208\u03a9\u2212\nm\u2208\u03a9+\nl\nk\u2212l\n\nwhere we assume \u03a9p to be a p-dimensional lattice that is completely contained\nin spanR {e1 , . . . , en\u22121 }. Due to the additional factor kx \u2212 y \u2217 kn\u22122 that appears\nin the denominator of p1 (x, y) and p2 (x, y), we get better convergence conditions\nthan in the monogenic case. Therefore, it is not necessary to add convergence\npreserving terms in the case p = n \u2212 1 which was necessary in the monogenic\ncase. For the k-cylinders with k < n we thus arrive at the following Cauchy\nintegral formula:\nTheorem 5 Let \u03a9k be a k-lattice that lies completely in spanR {e1 , . . . , en\u22121 }.\nLet Ck be the cylinder induced by Rn /\u03a9k . Suppose that U \u2032 \u2282 Ck is an open\nset and that K \u2032 \u2282 U is a domain with a Lipschitz boundary S \u2032 . Let Ej be one\nof the above mentioned spinor sections and suppose that f : U \u2032 \u2282 Ej is a left\nhypermonogenic function. Then\nf \u2032 (y \u2032 ) =\n\u2212\n\nn\u22122 Z\n2n\u22122 yn\u2032\nc\u2032 1 (x\u2032 , y \u2032 )dp(n(x))f \u2032 (x\u2032 )d\u03c3(x)\n\u03c9n\nS\u2032\nZ\nc\u2032 2 (x\u2032 , y \u2032 )dp(n(x))\u2217 f \u2217 (x\u2032 )d\u03c3(x\u2032 )\n\nS\u2032\n\nRemark: Notice that the operator Dh is not conformally invariant under translations in the en direction. This construction hence cannot be carried over\ndirectly to the context of the n-torus Cn . This is a significant difference to the\nmonogenic or Euclidean harmonic case.\n12\n\n\f3.3\n\nManifolds of higher genus\n\nAll these examples are manifolds with a genus being at most one. We conclude\nthis paper by also dedicating a few words on conformally flat spin manifolds of\ngenus g \u2265 2. For the construction of examples of conformally flat spin manifolds\nof higher genus, such as pretzel-type manifolds, or, more generally k-handled tori\nand k-handled polycylinders, we can use special arithmetic congruence groups\nof finite index in the special hypercomplex modular group\n\u0393p := hTe1 , . . . , Tep , J}.\nsuch as for example its homogeneous principal congruence subgroups of level N\n)\n(\u0012\n\u0013\na b\n\u0393p [N ] =\n\u2208 \u0393p a \u2212 1, b, c, d \u2212 1 \u2208 N Op\nc d\nor the following basic examples of congruence groups with conductor N\n)\n(\u0012\n\u0013\na b\n\u0393p 0 [N ] =\n\u2208 \u0393p c \u2208 N Op\nc d\nP\nwhich satisfy \u0393p [N ] \u2286 \u0393p 0 [N ] \u2286 \u0393p . Here, Ok =\nA\u2208P (1,...,k) ZeA denotes\nthe standard order in the real Clifford algebra Cln . Factoring out the upper\nhalf-space H + (Rn ) by groups of the type \u0393p [N ] or \u0393p 0 [N ] leads to examples\nthat belong to this family of conformally flat manifolds with genus g \u2265 2 when\nchoosing N sufficiently large. Further examples of conformally flat manifolds\nof higher genus can be obtained by factoring Cartesian products of half-spaces\nby groups of the type \u0393p [N ] or \u0393p 0 [N ]. This construction method provides a\ncounterpart to the gluing method discussed in the recent paper [29].\nMonogenic and harmonic automorphic forms on these groups hence give rise\nto monogenic and harmonic automorphic forms on these families of manifolds.\nSome non-trivial examples of (poly-)monogenic automorphic forms for congruence groups of the hypercomplex modular group \u0393p which include these groups,\nhave recently been constructed in [12, 13] on some symmetric spaces which\nprovide generalizations of the analytic Eisenstein- and Poincar\u00e9 series. Let us\nnow analyze which of them can be used (and how) in order to define non-trivial\nmonogenic and harmonic functions on H + /\u0393 where \u0393 is either a group belonging\nto the families \u0393p [N ] or \u0393p 0 [N ].\nFollowing [12], the function series\nG p,N (x) =\n\nX\n\nJ1 (M, x),\n\n(9)\n\nM:Tp [N ]\\\u0393p [N ]\n\nwhere M : Tp [N ]\\\u0393p [N ] means that the matrices M run through a system of\nrepresentatives of the right cosets of \u0393p [N ] modulo its subgroup of translation\n\n13\n\n\fmatrices denoted by Tp [N ], converges normally on H + (Rn ) under the condition\np < n \u2212 1; it satisfies\n\u0012\n\u0013\na b\np,N\np,N\n\u22121\nG (x) = J1 (M, x)G ((ax + b)(cx + d) )\n\u2200\n\u2208 \u0393p [N ]\nc d\nand its limit towards +en \u221e equals 1 under the condition N \u2265 3. Hence it\nis a non-trivial monogenic automorphic function for \u0393p [N ] on H + under these\nconditions, and induces, again under these conditions a left monogenic (nonvanishing) function on the associated spin manifold H + /\u0393p [N ] which is of genus\ng \u2265 2, provided N is chosen sufficiently large. However, as explained in [12,\n13], for all larger groups, including \u0393p [1], \u0393p [2] and also for the other basic\ncongruence groups \u0393p 0 [N ] the construction in (9) vanishes identically. This\nis basically due to the fact that the negative identity matrix is then included.\nSuch series do hence not provide us with monogenic functions on manifolds that\nare parameterized by these larger groups. This reflects a fundamental algebraic\nproperty. The groups \u0393p [N ] with N \u2265 3 are the largest congruence groups in \u0393p\nwith the property that they do not contain the negative identity matrix. All of\nthem are normal subgroups in \u0393p which is not the case for all other congruence\ngroups lying in between \u0393p [N ] and \u0393p .\nIn the harmonic case, the situation is slightly different. Due to the fact that\nH(x) is an even function which takes only non-negative positive values, the\nseries\nX\nJ2 (M, x)\n(10)\nHp,N (x) =\nM:Tp [N ]\\\u0393p [N ]\n\ndo also not vanish for N = 1, 2. As explained in [12], their limit towards +en \u221e\nequals +2 or 2p+1 in case N = 1 or N = 2, respectively. Hence the projection\np,N\np : H + (Rn ) \u2192 H + (Rn )/\u0393p [N ] : p(x) = H\u2032 (x\u2032 ) induces a well defined nonconstant harmonic function on H + (Rn )/\u0393p [N ] for each N \u2265 1 where p < n \u2212 2.\nHowever, one should mention that the two additional cases N = 1, 2 do not\nprovide a significant enrichment within this context of spin manifolds, since\nboth H + (Rn )/\u0393p [1] and H + (Rn )/\u0393p [2] have genus smaller than 2. However,\none gets more in the harmonic case in the following sense. The crucial point is\nthat in the harmonic case also all the series\nX\nJ2 (M, x)\n(11)\nH\u2032 p,N (x) =\nM:Tp 0 [N ]\\\u0393p 0 [N ]\n\nare non-vanishing automorphic forms on the basic congruence groups \u0393p 0 [N ]\nfor any N \u2208 N which is not the case in the monogenic case, since the negative\nidentity matrix is included in all these groups.\nHowever, due to the evenness of the harmonic weight function, one also gets a\npositive limit towards +en \u221e for all these groups. The projection H + (Rn ) \u2192\np,N\nH + (Rn )/\u0393p 0 [N ] : p(x) = H\u2032\u2032 (x\u2032 ) induce hence for all N \u2265 1 non-trivial\n+\nn\nharmonic functions on H (R )/\u0393p 0 [N ] which provide us with further examples\n\n14\n\n\fof conformally flat manifolds of genus g \u2265 2, whenever N is chosen sufficiently\nlarge.\nTwo natural questions arise immediately in this context. First, is it possible\nto also construct monogenic functions on the manifolds H + /\u0393p 0 [N ]? Second, is\nit possible to construct monogenic and harmonic functions on those manifolds\nof this type attached to the parameter p = n \u2212 1 and for p = n \u2212 2, n \u2212 1,\nrespectively? Notice that the convergence abscissa of the series (9) is only\np < n \u2212 1 in the monogenic case and p < n \u2212 2 in the harmonic case, for all\ngroups under consideration. In [12, 13] a construction has been proposed to also\nget monogenic and harmonic automorphic forms on \u0393n\u22121 and all its congruence\nsubgroups \u039b that satisfy \u0393p [N ] \u2286 \u039b \u2286 \u0393p for an N \u2208 N:\nX\ng x)J1 (M,\ng y)\nE1\u039b (x, y) =\nJ1 (M,\n(12)\nM:T (\u039b)\\\u039b\n\nand\n\nE2\u039b (x, y) =\n\nX\n\nM:T (\u039b)\\\u039b\n\ng x)J2 (M,\ng y)\nJ2 (M,\n\n(13)\n\nHere, T (\u039b) stands for the subgroup of translation matrices that is contained\nin \u039b. This type of series converges in the monogenic case even for p = n \u2212 1\nwhenever n \u2265 3. Similarly, in the harmonic case for n \u2265 4, due to having now\ntwo automorphy factors. Because of the two automorphy factors one furthermore gets a non identically vanishing series for all \u0393p and all their congruence\nsubgroups, including in particular all the groups \u0393p [N ] and \u0393p 0 [N ]. The limit\ntowards +en \u221e turned out to be always positive. Indeed, this series is an automorphic form on these groups; however, its projection does not induce a function\non the families of manifolds of the type H + (Rn )/\u0393p [N ] nor H + (Rn )/\u0393p 0 [N ],\nrespectively, since it is a function in two vector variables defined on the Cartesian product of two half-spaces! It hence induces examples of monogenic and\nharmonic functions on another type of conformally flat spin manifolds, namely\non those that arise from factoring out H + (Rn ) \u2295 H + (Rn ) by \u0393p [N ] and \u0393p 0 [N ].\nThis is a different type of manifold, however, choosing N sufficiently large, these\nwill also give examples of conformally flat manifolds of higher genus, although\nnot topologically equivalent to the others treated before.\nMany interesting questions are thus still open in this context. For a future\ndevelopment and a more quantative understanding it would be extremely important to find an explicit relation between the conductor of the particular\ncongruence groups \u0393p [N ] and \u0393p 0 [N ] and the genus of the manifold. In the\nclassical two dimensional case, such an explicit relation is given in terms of the\ngenus formula [31] which can be deduced as a special case of Euler's polyhedra\nformula. This problem is closely connected to the Riemann Roch theorem. In\nthe context considered here, we would need a higher dimensional analogue of\nthis machinery. A further task of central importance is to find in particular those\nmonogenic and harmonic functions on these manifolds that serve as Cauchy kernels or Green kernels. Maybe the above mentioned series could provide us some\n15\n\n\fuseful building blocks for the construction of such a kernel, since they have the\ngood property of being the \u0393p [N ]-periodizations (\u0393p 0 [N ]-periodizations) of the\nfundamental solution of the Euclidean Dirac operator.\n\nReferences\n[1] L.
