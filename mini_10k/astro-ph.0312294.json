We study the spectra of short\u2013bright GRBs detected by BATSE and compare them with\nthe average and time resolved spectral properties of long\u2013bright bursts. We confirm that short events\nare harder than long bursts, as already found from the comparison of their (fluence) hardness ratio,\nbut we find that this difference is mainly due to a harder low energy spectral component present in\nshort bursts, rather than to a (marginally) different peak energy. Moreover, we find that short GRBs\nare similar to the first 1 sec emission of long bursts. The comparison of the energetic of short and\nlong bursts also suggests that short GRBs do not obey the peak energy\u2013equivalent isotropic energy\ncorrelation recently proposed for long events, implying that short GRBs emit lower energy than\nlong ones. Nonetheless, short bursts seem to emit a luminosity similar to long GRBs and under such\nhypothesis their redshift distribution appears consistent with that observed for long events. These\nfindings might suggest the presence of a common mechanism at the beginning of short and long\nbursts which operates on different timescales in the these two classes.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nEvidences supporting the possible different nature of short and long GRBs are: (1) their\nbimodal duration distribution ([8]) with mean duration of \u223c 20 sec and \u223c 0.3 sec for\nlong and short events, respectively; (2) their different temporal properties (e.g. number\nand width of pulses in the light curve, [13], [12], [10]); (3) the larger hardness ratio of\nshort bursts ([8], [16], [14]). Moreover, theoretical models for the progenitors of GRBs\nassociate short bursts to the merger of compact objects in a binary system ([7], [11])\nwhile long GRBs seem to be connected to the core\u2013collapse of massive stars ([18],\n[17]).\nDespite the increasing understanding of the nature of long duration \u03b3 \u2013ray bursts, the\npopulation (\u223c 1/3) of sub-second short GRBs is still largely not understood. This is\nmainly due to (i) the low signal-to-noise ratio which strongly limits the analysis of the\nprompt (temporal and spectral) emission of short events, and (ii) the lack of any firm\nafterglow measurement for short GRBs, which indeed represented a major advance in\nunveiling the mystery of long bursts.\n\nSHORT VS. LONG: SPECTRAL PROPERTIES\nThe emission properties of long GRBs have been studied in details ([2], [15]) by fitting\ntheir time average ([2]) and time resolved ([15], [4]) broad-band high-resolution spectra.\nNonetheless, the comparison with the spectral properties of short bursts has been based\n\n\fFIGURE 1. Distribution of the spectral parameters for short (solid line) and long (dotted line) GRBs.\nLeft: peak energy (E peak ) of the EFE spectrum and low energy photon spectral index (\u03b1 ) for the average\nspectra of long and short bursts. Right: E peak and \u03b1 of the first 1 second of long bursts compared to the\naverage spectra of short events.\n\nmainly on the analysis of their fluence hardness ratio (e.g. [3], [19]) which is marginally\nrepresentative of the effective spectral shape. For this reason we analyzed ([6]) a sample\nof bright\u2013short BATSE bursts (selected with peak flux \u2265 10 phot/cm2 sec between 50300 keV) by fitting their \u03b3 \u2013ray spectra (\u223c 30 \u2212 1800 keV) with the standard spectral\nfunctions (e.g. [15]). The set of spectral parameters (namely the low energy photon\nspectral index \u03b1 and the EFE peak energy E peak ) were compared with those of long\nbright bursts ([15]) both considering time integrated and time resolved spectra.\nAs shown in fig.1 (Left) short and long GRBs present different \u03b1 distributions and\nonly marginally different E peak distributions (with a small Kolmogorov-Smirnov test\nprobability - i.e. 4% and 10%, respectively - for the two population to be similar). The\naverage values are h\u03b1 i = \u22120.84\u00b10.15, hE peak i = 305\u00b122 keV and h\u03b1 i = \u22120.58\u00b10.10,\nhE peak i = 355 \u00b1 30 keV for long and short GRBs, respectively. This suggests that short\nbursts have (average) harder spectra than long events, as also indicated by the analysis of\ntheir hardness ratio, but, intriguingly, this difference is due to a considerably harder low\nenergy spectral component present in short bursts rather than to a different peak energy.\nThe comparison of short GRBs with the time resolved spectral properties of long bursts\nshows that short events have spectra similar to the first 1 sec of long GRBs, as shown in\nfig.1 (Right), with a high KS probability of 23% and 80% for \u03b1 and E peak to be similar.\nThis might suggest that a similar mechanism operates for the complete duration of short\nbursts and in the first 1 sec of long GRBs.\n\nSHORT VS. LONG: ENERGY AND LUMINOSITY\nThe analysis of the intrinsic properties of (still few) long bursts with known redshift\n1.93 ) between is the equivalent isotropic\n([1]) highlighted a possible correlation (Eiso \u221d E peak\nburst energy Eiso and the spectral peak energy E peak . This correlation has been also\nconfirmed by Hete\u2013II ([9]) and a similar relation has been found between E peak and the\n\n\fFIGURE 2. Left: Equivalent isotropic energy Eiso (a) and equivalent isotropic luminosity Liso (b) vs.\nE peak . Solid lines represent the correlations between these intrinsic properties found for long bursts ([1]\nand [20]). Curves represent the intrinsic Eiso (Liso ) and E peak for short bursts assuming a variable redshift\nbetween 0.1 and 10. Right: Redshift distribution of short bursts (solid line) assuming that they indeed\nsatisfy the Liso vs. E peak relation. For comparison also the observed distribution of long bursts (dotted\nline) is reported.\n\nburst isotropic luminosity Liso ([20]). If short bursts were similar to long events they\nmight satisfy these correlations between Eiso (Liso ) and E peak . However, no redshift of\nshort GRBs has been measured so far. Nonetheless, we can still verify ([6]) the above\nhypothesis assuming a variable redshift (between 0.1 and 10) and scaling the observed\nspectral properties of the sample of bright short bursts in the source rest frame.\nFig.2-a shows that for any assumed z short bursts (solid curves) populate a region\nbelow the E peak - Eiso correlation of long bursts ([1] - solid line). On the other hand (fig.2b) the luminosity of short events is consistent with the proposed relation for long bursts\n([20] - solid line). In conclusion short and long bursts seem to emit a similar equivalent\nisotropic luminosity but different (lower in short bursts) energy due to their different\nduration. Nonetheless, short and long bursts might still have similar emitted energies\nif short bursts are less collimated than long events although, in this case, short bursts\nwould have a much larger luminosity. Under the first hypothesis we can further extract\nfrom the Liso -E peak relation the possible redshift distribution of short bursts (fig.2-right,\nsolid line). This is consistent with the observed z distribution of long events (fig.2-right,\ndotted line) and again supports a possible similarity of short and long GRBs.\n\n\fDISCUSSION\nThe comparison of the spectral properties of short and long bursts pointed out that\nshort bursts are harder than long events due to a (average) harder low energy spectral\ncomponent (rather than to a different peak energy). The spectra of short bursts are\nsimilar to the first 1 sec of the emission of long bursts. Intriguingly, short bursts present\na similar intrinsic luminosity but a lower (isotropic) energy than long bursts if the\nrecently found correlations between these quantities were true also for short GRBs.\nUnder such hypothesis the implied redshift distribution of short bursts results similar\nto that observed in long GRBs, and this prediction will be tested in the forthcoming\nSwift era. Nonetheless, short GRBs might still have a similar energy to that of long\nbursts if their collimation angle is much larger than that of long events, but in this case\ntheir intrinsic luminosity should be much larger than that of long bursts. These results\nsuggest the presence of a common mechanism operating at the beginning of short and\nlong bursts which could explain their similar spectral properties and luminosity. If this\nis the case a possible difference in the burst dynamical evolution (e.g. fallback of the\npre-GRB ejected material) might play a crucial role in distinguishing these two classes.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nG.
