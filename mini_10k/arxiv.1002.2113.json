We demonstrate that Tc can be a nonmonotonic function of the angle \u03b1 between the magnetizations of the two F layers. The minimum is achieved at an intermediate \u03b1, lying between the parallel\n(P, \u03b1 = 0) and antiparallel (AP, \u03b1 = \u03c0) cases. This implies a possibility of a \"triplet\" spin-valve effect: at\ntemperatures above the minimum TcTr but below TcP and TcAP , the system is superconducting only in the\nvicinity of the collinear orientations. At certain parameters, we predict a reentrant Tc (\u03b1) behavior. At the\nsame time, considering only the P and AP orientations, we find that both the \"standard\" (TcP < TcAP ) and\n\"inverse\" (TcP > TcAP ) switching effects are possible depending on parameters of the system.\nPublished as: JETP Letters 91, 308 (2010) [Pis'ma v ZhETF 91, 329 (2010)]\nPACS: 74.45.+c, 74.78.Fk, 75.70.Cn, 75.30.Et\n\nfect [9, 10, 11, 13] with TcP > TcAP (i.e., \u2206Tc < 0). The\nmost advanced calculations within the proximity effect\ntheory, which take into account the triplet components\nof the superconducting pairing [14], demonstrate only\nthe standard switching [3, 15] with Tc monotonically increasing from the P to AP configuration [3]. Additional\nphysical mechanisms like spin imbalance effect [9, 11] or\nmagnetic domain structure [10, 12] should be recruited\nto explain the inverse spin-valve effect in the studied\nF1/S/F2-type structures.\n\nIn superconducting spin valves with the layer sequence F1/S/F2 the superconducting transition temperature Tc of the system can be controlled by mutual\nalignment of magnetizations M1,2 of the two ferromagnetic layers F1 and F2. Therefore, at a temperature T\nfixed inside the range of Tc variation, there is an opportunity for switching the superconductivity on and off\nby reversing the magnetization direction of the F1 or\nF2 layer. Model calculations have shown that the transition temperature TcAP for the antiparallel (M1 \u2191\u2193 M2 )\norientation of the F1 and F2 magnetizations should be\nhigher than the transition temperature TcP for the opposite case (M1 \u2191\u2191 M2 ) [1, 2, 3]. The situation with\nthis order of Tc 's (i.e., TcP < TcAP ) is commonly referred\nto as the \"standard\" switching (see, e.g., [4]), and the\nswitching in this case actually occurs at temperatures\nT such that TcP < T < TcAP . The basic physical reason\nfor the difference \u2206Tc = TcAP \u2212 TcP > 0 is partial compensation of the pair-breaking ferromagnetic exchange\nfield, if the magnetizations of the F1 and F2 layers are\naligned antiparallel.\n\nA bit earlier an unconventional spin-valve-like\nS/F1/F2 structure was theoretically proposed in [16]\nto control the superconducting Tc in the S layer by\nmutual alignment of the magnetizations of the two\nadjacent ferromagnetic layers F1 and F2. The authors\nof [16] argued that TcP < TcAP in their system because\nof partial cancelation of the pair-breaking exchange\nfields just within the magnetic F1/F2 subsystem of the\nstructure, thus predicting the standard switching as in\nthe interleaved F1/S/F2 structure.\nThe S/F1/F2 structures are much less investigated\nexperimentally [8, 17], and the experiments indicate the\nstandard switching effect [16] with the maximal size of\nabout 200 mK. In this Letter we study the critical temperature of a S/F1/F2 trilayer at arbitrary angle between the in-plane magnetizations of the ferromagnetic\nlayers (see Fig. l). We demonstrate that this structure allows not only the standard but also inverse spinswitching effect. Moreover, we show for the first time\n\nSeveral experimental groups have published results\non superconducting spin valves of the F1/S/F2 type\n[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. The experimental results\nturned out to be controversial. Some studies of F1/S/F2\nstructures have shown the standard spin-valve effect\n[4, 5, 6, 7, 8] with the maximum shift \u2206Tc \u2248 41 mK\nreported for the Ni/Nb/Ni trilayer in [7]. However,\nsome experiments revealed the \"inverse\" spin-valve ef1\n\n\f2\n\nYa. V. Fominov, A. A. Golubov, T. Yu.

Since TcTr is\nlower than both TcP and TcAP , this offers a possibility of\na \"triplet spin-valve effect\" never reported before.\n1. Model. We consider the S/F1/F2 structure in\nthe dirty limit, which is described by the Usadel equations. Near Tc , the Usadel equations are linearized and\ncontain only the anomalous Green function f\u02c7 [14, 18]:\ni sgn \u03c9 \b\nD d2 f\u02c7\n\u03c4\u03020 (h\u03c3\u0302), f\u02c7 + \u2206\u03c4\u03021 \u03c3\u03020 = 0. (1)\n\u2212 |\u03c9|f\u02c7 \u2212\n2\n2 dx\n2\nHere, f\u02c7 is a 4\u00d74 matrix, \u03c4\u0302i and \u03c3\u0302i are the Pauli matrices in the Nambu-Gor'kov and spin spaces, respectively,\nD is the diffusion constant, and \u03c9 = \u03c0Tc (2n + 1) with\ninteger n is the Matsubara frequency. The exchange\nfield in the middle F1 layer is along the z direction,\nh = (0, 0, h), while the exchange field in the outer F2\nlayer is in the yz plane: h = (0, h sin \u03b1, h cos \u03b1). The\nangle \u03b1 changes between 0 (parallel configuration, P)\nand \u03c0 (antiparallel configuration, AP). The order parameter \u2206 is real-valued in the superconducting layer,\nwhile in the ferromagnetic layers it is zero. In general,\nthe diffusion constant D acquires a proper subscript, S\nor F, when Eq. (1) is applied to the superconducting\nor ferromagnetic layers, respectively. However, for simplicity we take them equal in this paper, because this\nassumption does not influence qualitative behavior of\nTc (\u03b1).\nThe Green function f\u02c7 can be expanded into the following components:\nf\u02c7 = \u03c4\u03021 (f0 \u03c3\u03020 + f3 \u03c3\u03023 + f2 \u03c3\u03022 ) ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere f0 is the singlet component, f3 is the triplet\nwith zero projection on the z axis, and f2 is the triplet\n\nwith \u00b11 projections on z (the latter is present only if\n\u03b1 6= 0, \u03c0). The singlet component is even in frequency\n(and real-valued), while the triplet ones are odd (and\nimaginary): f0 (\u2212\u03c9) = f0 (\u03c9), f3 (\u2212\u03c9) = \u2212f3 (\u03c9), and\nf2 (\u2212\u03c9) = \u2212f2 (\u03c9), which makes it sufficient to consider\nonly positive Matsubara frequencies, \u03c9 > 0.\nAs we show below, the problem of calculating Tc\ncan be reduced to an effective set of equations for the\nsinglet component in the S layer: the set includes the\nself-consistency equation and the Usadel equation,\n\u0013\nX \u0012\u2206\nTcS\n\u2206 ln\n(3)\n= 2\u03c0Tc\n\u2212 f0 ,\nTc\n\u03c9\n\u03c9>0\nD d2 f0\n\u2212 \u03c9f0 + \u2206 = 0,\n2 dx2\n\n(4)\n\nwith the boundary conditions\ndf0\n=0\ndx\n\n,\nx=\u2212dS\n\n\u2212\u03be\n\ndf0\n= W f0\ndx\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\nx=0\n\np\nHere TcS and \u03be = D/2\u03c0TcS are the superconducting\ntransition temperature and coherence length for an isolated S layer, and we assume that the S layer occupies\nthe region \u2212dS < x < 0 (see Fig. 1). This is exactly the\nproblem for which the multi-mode solution procedure\n(as well as the fundamental-solution method) was developed in [19] and then applied to F1/S/F2 spin valves\nin [3]. We only need to determine the explicit expression for W in Eq. (5), solving the boundary problem for\nthe S/F1/F2 structure.\n2. Solution of the model. To simplify derivations, while keeping the essential physics, we consider\nthe middle ferromagnetic layer F1 of arbitrary thickness (0 < x < dF ) but the outer ferromagnetic layer F2\nbeing semi-infinite (dF < x < \u221e). The Usadel equation\n(1) generates the following characteristic wave vectors:\nr\nr\nq\n2\u03c9\nh\n, kh =\n, k\u0303h = k\u03c92 + 2ikh2 . (6)\nk\u03c9 =\nD\nD\nOnly k\u03c9 appears in the solution for the S layer, while\nthe F-layers' solutions are described by k\u03c9 , k\u0303h , and k\u0303h\u2217 .\nSince the exchange energy is usually larger than the superconducting energy scale, h \u226b Tc , the k\u03c9 mode in the\nferromagnetic layers (arising at noncollinear magnetizations) represents the long-range triplet component [14],\nwhich plays the key role in the present study.\nIn the S layer the solution of Eq. (1) is:\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n0\nf0 (x)\nf0 (x)\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec \uf8f7 cosh (k\u03c9 (x + dS ))\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n.

Finding the S2 coefficient [which is\nproportional to f0 (0)], we substitute it into Eq. (11) and\nthus explicitly find W entering the effective boundary\nconditions (5).\n3. Analysis of the solution. After reducing the\nproblem to Eqs. (3)-(5), all the information about the\ntwo F layers is contained in the single real-valued function W . This function makes f0 (x) bend at the S/F1\ninterface, hence the larger W , the stronger Tc is suppressed.\nThe explicit expression for W (\u03b1) is very cumbersome and we do not write it here. However, certain\nanalytical development (as well as complete numerical\nanalysis) is possible. For the analytical consideration,\nwe make an additional assumption of Tc \u226a h, which\nimplies k\u03c9 \u226a kh . For the collinear cases (\u03b1 = 0 and\n\u03b1 = \u03c0) we then find W (0) = 2kh \u03be and\n\u221a\n2 sin(2kh dF + \u03c0/4) \u2212 e\u22122kh dF\n,\nW (0) \u2212 W (\u03c0) = 2kh \u03be\nsinh(2kh dF ) + cos(2kh dF )\n(12)\nwhich oscillates as a function of dF , changing its sign\n(see Fig. 2). Thus, as a result of interference in the\nmiddle F1 layer, we can either have the standard spinswitching effect with TcP < TcAP [when the pair-breaking\nat the P alignment is stronger than at the AP alignment of magnetizations, i.e., at W (0) \u2212 W (\u03c0) > 0 as in\nthe range 2kh dF < 3\u03c0/4 in Fig. 2] or the inverse spinswitching effect with TcP > TcAP [at W (0)\u2212W (\u03c0) < 0 as\nin the range 3\u03c0/4 < 2kh dF < 7\u03c0/4 in Fig. 2]. Note that\nthe amplitude of the inverse effect is notably smaller\ncompared with the standard one. The analytical calcu-\n\n\f4\n\nYa. V. Fominov, A. A. Golubov, T. Yu.

Critical temperature Tc vs. the misalignment\nangle \u03b1 for various thicknesses of the F1 layer. We took\nh/\u03c0TcS = 6.8; all other parameters are shown in the\nfigure. In the cases dF = 0 and dF = \u221e, which are\nphysically equivalent (curve \"1\"), Tc does not depend\non \u03b1. Curves \"2\" and \"4\" correspond to the standard\nand inverse switching effects, respectively. Curve \"3\"\ndemonstrates the triplet spin-valve effect. The coherence lengths \u03beS and \u03beF were taken equal (denoted by \u03be\nin the text) in order to present our main results in the\nsimplest possible case. At \u03b1 = 0 all the curves coincide,\nsince in this case the F part of the system is physically\nequivalent to a single half-infinite F layer.\n\nlation of the second derivatives of W (\u03b1) at \u03b1 = 0 and \u03c0\n(the first ones are zero) shows that under the above assumption, both the collinear alignments represent local\nminima of W (\u03b1). This means that Tc (\u03b1) decreases as\nthe configuration deviates from the P or AP alignment.\nTherefore, Tc (\u03b1) is nonmonotonic, and the minimal Tc\nmust be achieved at some noncollinear configuration of\nmagnetizations at \u03b1 6= 0, \u03c0.\nThe analytical results obtained at k\u03c9 \u226a kh are illustrated and extended by numerical calculations at arbitrary relation between k\u03c9 and kh . Figure 3 shows\ndependence of the transition temperature Tc on the angle \u03b1 between the magnetizations. We see that at small\nthicknesses dF of the middle ferromagnetic layer F1, the\nswitching effect is standard, while at larger dF the effect is inverse (TcP > TcAP ). Moreover, when the F1 layer\nthickness is around a half of the coherence length \u03be, the\nminimal critical temperature TcTr at noncollinear orientations is significantly lower that both TcP and TcAP -\nthis case corresponds to the triplet spin-valve effect.\nNote that depending on the parameters of the system,\nthe minimum of Tc (\u03b1), predicted analytically, can shift\n\n0\n\n30\n\n60\n\n90\n\n120\n\n150\n\n180\n\nAngle between magnetizations (degrees)\n\nFig. 4.

Curves \"2\" and \"4\" demonstrate the reentrant behavior, in which case the triplet\nspin-valve effect takes place even at T = 0.\n\nto a close vicinity of either \u03b1 = 0 or \u03b1 = \u03c0, becoming\nshallow and indistinguishable.\nFigure 4 demonstrates the possibility of reentrant\nTc (\u03b1) dependence. In this situation the triplet spinvalve effect takes place even at T = 0.\n4. Discussion. The physical interpretation of the\ntriplet spin-valve effect can be given as follows: at the\ncollinear configurations, both the singlet component f0\nand the zero-projection triplet component f3 of the\npairing function are short-ranged (with the characteristic penetration depth of the order of kh\u22121 ), so that at\nkh\u22121 \u226a dF the middle F1 layer plays a role of a shield\nseparating the S layer from the ferromagnetic half-space\nF2. When the angle between magnetizations declines\nfrom the collinear configurations, the long-range triplet\ncomponent f2 of the pairing function is generated [14].\nThen, the S layer becomes effectively coupled by this\nlong-range triplet component to the semi-infinite ferromagnetic F2 layer. The pair-breaking in the S layer\nenhances, giving rise to more effective suppression of superconducting Tc . In other words, we can say that the\nTc suppression is due to \"leakage\" of Cooper pairs into\nthe ferromagnetic part. In this language, the generation\nof the long-range triplet component opens up an additional channel for this \"leakage\", hence Tc is suppressed\nstronger.\nIn order to supply the qualitative picture by more\nquantitative details, we can find the amplitudes of different components at the S/F1 interface in the limit of\nk\u03c9 \u226a kh and large dF . This can be done analytically\n\n\fSuperconducting triplet spin valve\nfrom the boundary conditions which produce the linear\nsystem of equations for the coefficients entering Eqs. (7)(9). We find that in the limit of dF \u226b k\u03c9\u22121 , kh\u22121 , the amplitudes of the long-range triplet components near the\nS/F1 interface (which are given by C1 , S1 , and B) are\nsuppressed by the factor e\u2212k\u03c9 dF \u2212kh dF which has a clear\nphysical interpretation. The long-range components are\ngenerated from the short-range ones at the F1/F2 interface (i.e., at x = dF ), where electrons \"feel\" inhomogeneous magnetization. Therefore, the long-range contribution at the S/F1 interface is obtained as a result of\na \"wave\" that goes from the S/F1 interface as a shortrange component with the wave vector kh and returns\nafter reflection at the F1/F2 interface as a long-range\ncomponent with the wave vector k\u03c9 . At the same time,\nthe self-consistency equation (3) that determines Tc ,\ncontains only the singlet short-range component. Therefore, the influence of the long-range components on Tc\nis indirect: the long-range components influence Tc only\nthrough their influence on the singlet component. We\nfind that while the difference between W (that encodes\nthe information about the suppression of Tc ) for the\nP and AP cases is suppressed as e\u22122kh dF (the shortrange components go from the S/F1 to F1/F2 interface\nand back), the changes in W due to noncollinear magnetizations contain the same exponential, e\u22122kh dF . Of\ncourse, the influence of the long-range triplet components is contained in prefactors but no long-ranged exponential (with k\u03c9 instead of kh ) appears in W , because\nW still originates from the short-range components.\nIn conclusion, we have considered a mesoscopic\nS/F1/F2 structure composed of a superconducting layer\nS, a ferromagnetic layer of arbitrary thickness F1, and\na ferromagnetic half-space F2. We have demonstrated\nthat the structure exhibits different relations between\nthe critical temperatures in the parallel and antiparallel configuration: both the standard (TcP < TcAP ) and\ninverse (TcP > TcAP ) switching can be realized depending on the system's parameters. At the same time, our\nmain result is that TcTr at noncollinear magnetizations is\nlower than both TcP and TcAP, which makes this system\na triplet spin valve. Possible experimental observation\nof a nonmonotonic (like curve \"3\" in Fig. 3 or curves \"1\"\nand \"3\" in Fig. 4) or even reentrant (like curves \"2\" and\n\"4\" in Fig. 4) behavior of Tc (\u03b1) could be a signature of\nexistence of the long-range triplet superconducting correlations [14] in SF hybrid structures.\nWe are grateful to I.
