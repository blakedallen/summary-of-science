INTRODUCTION\n\nZwicky (1951) was the first one to observe a weak and\ndiffuse intra-cluster light in the Coma cluster, suggesting the presence of material in the intra-cluster medium\n(ICM). The jump in sensitivity of the CCD detectors\nlater allowed intra-cluster light to be studied more quantitatively (see e.g., Bernstein et al. 1995; Feldmeier et\nal. 2002; Zibetti et al. 2005). The existence of an intracluster stellar population has further been clearly established with the detection of planetary nebulae (Arnaboldi\net al. 1996; Feldmeier et al. 1998), red giant stars (Ferguson et al. 1998) and supernovae (Gal-Yam et al. 2003) in\nthe ICM. In parallel, X-ray spectroscopic observations revealed the presence of heavy metals in the ICM (Mitchell\net al. 1976; Mushotzky et al. 1996). This ICM matter\nis commonly believed to originate from stripping and/or\ndisruption of cluster galaxies, and one can then naturally\nwonder about the existence of dust in the ICM.\nIt is true that the ICM is a harsh medium, where strong\nX-ray radiation and gas temperatures of \u223c 107 K may\nimpose severe restrictions on the presence of dust. However, the survival timescale for dust grains in this environment is still of the order of few 108 yr (Draine &\nSalpeter 1979). Besides, many mechanisms, such as tidal\nor ram pressure stripping, galactic winds, mass loss from\nICM red giants and supergiants, or possible accretion\nof primordial dust, may contribute to the release or replenishment of dust in the ICM [see, e.g.,Popescu et al.\n(2000), Schindler et al. (2005), Domainko et al. (2006) for\npredictions on the efficiency of the different mechanisms].\nWhile there have been many attempts, using various\nmethods, to detect the existence of dust in the ICM\n(see Table 1), the debate is still open. The methods\nare mostly twofold: either based on a direct search for\ndust thermal emission, typically peaking in the far infrared to submillimeter range, or on an indirect search\nfor extinction and reddening of background sources.\n\nThe direct detection of extended thermal emission in\nthe intra-cluster medium would constitute the best evidence for the presence of ICM dust. Theoretical predictions of the IR emission have been made (see e.g., Dwek\net al. 1990, Yamada & Kitayama 2005); taking into account dust injection by galaxies, sputtering, and heating\nby the hot ICM plasma, they yield a mean dust temperature of \u223c 20 \u2212 30 K, and dust-to-gas ratio \u223c 10\u22126 .\nAnnis & Jewitt (1993) could not detect significant emission from a submillimeter search towards 11 clusters with\ncooling flows, up to a limit of \u223c 108 M\u2299 . Wise et al.\n(1993) observed with IRAS a larger sample of 56 clusters,\nfrom which only two may show evidence for extended\ndiffuse emission. Further ISO observations revealed FIR\nexcess emission towards Coma (Stickel et al. 1998), possibly due to a dust mass of \u223c 107 \u2212 109 M\u2299 in the inner\n0.4 Mpc region, but none towards five other Abell clusters (Stickel et al. 2002). More recently, Montier & Giard\n(2005) adopted a statistical approach and co-added IRAS\nmaps of a large number (> 11, 000) of clusters and detected a significant emission in all four IRAS band (12,\n25, 60 and 100 \u03bcm). The origin of the emission, tentatively attributed to ICM dust, is, however, questionable. Indeed, in addition to the challenging detection\nof low surface brightness and extended emission, IR observations of ICM dust might be affected by contamination from Galactic cirrus (e.g., Wise et al. 1993; Bai et\nal. 2007), as well as from cluster members (Quillen et\nal. 1999), dusty star forming galaxies in clusters (Geach\net al. 2006), dust associated with the central dominant\ngalaxies or the presence of a cooling flow (Bregman et al.\n1990; Grabelsky & Ulmer 1990; Cox et al. 1995; Edge et\nal. 1999), or even from background (possibly magnified)\ngalaxies.\nThe first claim for ICM dust was, nevertheless, historically made by Zwicky (1962), based on the extinction of\nlight from distant clusters by nearby ones. He estimated\nAV \u223c 0.4 for Coma. Karachentsev & Lipovetskii (1969)\n\n\f2\n\nMuller et al. 2008\n\nderived a similar value of AV \u223c 0.3 mag for Coma, and\nfound a mean cluster extinction of AV \u223c 0.20 \u00b1 0.05\nmag by averaging over 15 clusters. Bogart & Wagoner\n(1973) measured that distant Abell clusters appear to\nbe inversely correlated on the sky with nearby ones. To\naccount for this effect, they argued for an extinction corresponding to AV \u223c 0.4 mag and extending to \u223c 2.5\ntimes the optical radii of the nearby clusters. However,\nthese first results were probably severly affected by the\ndifficulties of identifying background clusters.\nObvious background sources to search for dust extinction and reddening are quasars. Boyle et al. (1988) measured a value of AB = 0.2 mag (AV \u223c 0.15 mag) from\na deficiency of ultraviolet-excess-selected objects behind\nclusters of galaxies. Similarly, Romani & Maoz (1992)\nconcluded that an area-averaged extinction of AB \u223c 0.5\nmag was required to explain the anti-correlation between quasars and Abell clusters. On the other hand,\nMaoz (1995) could not measure a significant difference\n[E(B \u2212V )\u2264 0.05] between the color distribution of radioselected quasars located within 1\u25e6 of a foreground Abell\ncluster, and quasars with no cluster in their line of sight.\nHe reached the conclusion that the apparent deficiency\nof optically discovered quasars in the background of clusters could be attributed to selection effects, reflecting the\ndifficulty to identify quasars in crowded fields.\nMore recently, Nollenberg et al. (2003) proposed, to our\nknowledge, the first and only search so far of ICM dust\nbased on extinction and reddening of background galaxies. They used a catalog of \u223c 140 nearby (z < 0.08)\nclusters with B and R photometric data, complete to\nB \u223c 20.5 mag and R \u223c 19.5 mag. For each cluster,\nthey constructed two samples. The \"cluster\" sample includes all galaxies lying in a circular region centered on\nthe cluster, and with an angular radius equivalent to the\nphysical radius of 1.3 Mpc at the distance of the cluster.\nThe second sample, namely \"control sample\", contains\ngalaxies projected within a ring of inner radius 1.3 Mpc\nand of outer radius such that the area covered by the\ncluster and control samples are identical. The cluster\nand control samples for all clusters were then respectively\nmerged to increase the number of galaxies and improve\nthe statistics. The cluster sample inevitably suffers from\ncontamination of cluster members and foreground galaxies, although Nollenberg et al. (2003) estimate that these\nlatest amount to less than 10% contamination. The cluster and control group galaxies were then distributed in\ntwo color-magnitude diagrams (CMD), and any extinction and reddening of the cluster group was searched by\nshifting the cluster CMD both in magnitude and color\nwith respect to the control CMD, until the two CMD\nmatched. The pixel resolution (in magnitude and color)\nof the CMD is constrained by the number of galaxies in\neach pixel, which should be high enough. Given the number of galaxies in each of their samples (< 105 ), Nollenberg et al. (2003) fixed the smallest reasonable pixel size\nfor \u2206(B \u2212 R) and \u2206R to 0.025. They could not detect\na significant difference between the cluster and control\nsamples, thus yielding upper limits of AR < 0.025 and\nE(B \u2212 R)< 0.025 mag (AV < 0.044) for ICM dust.\nWe note briefly that dust extinction and reddening\nof background galaxies have been successfully detected\nin galactic disks (see, e.g., Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 1998, Holwerda et al. 2005), galactic halos (Zaritsky 1994), and,\n\nrecently, in the intergalactic medium towards the M81\ngroup (Xilouris et al. 2006). This simple method should\nbecome more and more popular with the advent of wide\nfield cameras on board of large telescopes.\nFinally, in a very recent paper, Chelouche et al. (2007)\nclaim the detection of reddening of background quasars\nbehind 0.1 < z < 0.3 galaxy clusters using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) photometric and spectroscopic\ndata. They report E(g \u2212 i) of 0.003 \u00b1 0.002 from photometry analysis, on one hand, and 0.008 \u00b1 0.003 from spectroscopic extinction curve, on the other hand, towards\nthe central \u223c 1 Mpc of clusters. Assuming a Galactic\nextinction curve (Schlegel et al. 1998), this converts to\nAV \u223c 0.005 \u00b1 0.003 and 0.013 \u00b1 0.004, respectively. The\nreference quasars were taken at large projected distances\n(> 7 Mpc) from the cluster centers. Their measurement\nof average reddening at different radial annuli seems to\nindicate both a large covering factor and a large scale\ndistribution of dust, up to 5 \u2212 6 Mpc.\nIn the present paper, we propose to address the question of the presence of dust in the ICM by studying\nthe statistical reddening of galaxies located in the background of clusters, as compared to a reference sample of\ngalaxies located away from the line of sight to clusters.\nWe have constructed the samples based on the cluster\nand galaxy catalogs from the Red-sequence Cluster Survey (RCS, Gladders & Yee 2005), and using galaxy photometric redshifts. In \u00a72, we briefly describe the RCS\ndata and present our galaxy sample selection and analysis. Our results are discussed in \u00a73, and a summary is\ngiven in \u00a74.\n2. DATA AND DATA ANALYSIS\n\n2.1. The Red-Sequence Cluster Catalog\n\nThe Red-Sequence Cluster Survey (RCS, Gladders &\nYee 2005) made use of both the Canada-France-Hawaii\nTelescope (CFHT) and the Cerro Tololo Inter-American\nObservatory to cover a total sky area of \u223c90 deg2 in the\nRc (6500\u00c5) and z \u2032 (9100\u00c5) bands. We hereby consider\nonly the CFHT RCS data overlapping with the CFHT\nfollow-up observations in the B and V bands presented in\nHsieh et al. (2005), briefly described below in \u00a72.2. The\nintersection of the B, V, Rc and z \u2032 data results in a total\nof 33.6 deg2 over 10 different fields (see Table 2), located\nat high Galactic latitude (> 40\u25e6 ) to minimize Galactic\nextinction.\nThe RCS was originally designed to obtain a large sample of galaxy clusters up to redshift z \u223c 1.4, using the\ncluster red-sequence method (Gladders & Yee 2000). In\nthis method, clusters are identified as density enhancements in the four-dimensional space of position, color and\nmagnitude. Red-sequence models provide cluster photometric redshifts for which a comparison with spectroscopic data shows that the accuracy is typically better\nthan 0.05 over the redshift range 0.2 < z < 1.0.\nIn total, the RCS cluster catalog includes \u223c 4,000 identified clusters with redshift 0.2 < z < 1.4, each listed\nwith position, redshift, size and richness [see Gladders\n& Yee (2005)]. The cluster size is defined by the R200\nradius, within which the average galaxy density is 200\ntimes the critical density. The cluster richness is estimated through the amplitude of the cluster galaxy correlation function Bgc. This parameter basically traces\nthe excess galaxy counts around a reference point (e.g.,\n\n\fSearching for ICM dust\nthe center of a cluster), given a luminosity function and\na spatial distribution for galaxies, and is known to be\na robust quantitative measurement of the cluster richness [see Yee & Lopez-Cruz (1999) for a detailed discussion on the Bgc parameter]. For this study, we extracted\nonly clusters with zclust < 0.5 and Bgc > 200 (in unit\n\u22121\nof Mpc1.8 h\u22121.8\nMpc\u22121 ),\n50 , where h50 = H0 /50 km s\nyielding a subset catalog of 458 clusters. The typical uncertainty in Bgc for RCS clusters is 150 to 200, and the\naverage Bgg (i.e., the galaxy-galaxy correlation amplitude computed by picking any random galaxy) is about\n60.\nThe RCS cluster catalog is not complete for nearby\nclusters (i.e., z < 0.2), due to the choice of the Rc and\nz \u2032 filters, optimized to find clusters at higher redshift.\nWe have used the MaxBCG cluster catalog issued from\nthe SDSS, recently published by Koester et al. (2007),\nto check the apparent surface covered by SDSS nearby\nclusters (0.05 < z < 0.35), with respect to RCS data. 7\nout of the 10 RCS patches overlap with the SDSS and we\nfound a total of 41 SDSS clusters within these limits. By\nfixing a typical size of 5\u2032 (in radius) for each cluster, we\nestimate that the coverage of these nearby clusters represents a surface area less than 4% of the corresponding\nRCS data. We therefore neglect the contamination by\nnearby (z < 0.2) clusters in our study.\n2.2. Photometric Redshifts\n\nAdditional photometric data were obtained in the V\nand B bands with the CFHT for some part of the RCS\nfields. The intersection of B, V, Rc and z \u2032 data covers\na total \u223c 33 deg2 , with limiting magnitudes of 23.9 in\nz \u2032 (AB), 25.0 in Rc (Vega), 24.5 in V (Vega), and 25.0\nin B (Vega). The four-band photometry data, corrected\nfor Galactic extinction, were used by Hsieh et al. (2005)\nto derive photometric redshifts for \u223c 1.2 million galaxies, using an empirical quadratic polynomial fitting technique with spectroscopic redshifts for 4,924 galaxies in\nthe training set. However, since then more spectroscopic\ndata became available for the RCS fields, which can be\nadded to the training set. In particular, the DEEP2 DR2\n1\nprovides 4,297 matched spectroscopic redshifts in the\nrange 0.7 < z < 1.5. The new training set not only\ncontains almost twice as many objects compared to the\noriginal one but also provides a much larger sample for\nz > 0.7, i.e., better photometric redshift solution for\nhigh redshift objects. Besides having a larger training\nset, we also used an empirical third-order polynomial fitting technique with 16 Kd-Tree cells for the photometric\nredshift estimation, allowing a higher redshift accuracy\nand giving a rms scatter < 0.05 for \u03b4zph within the redshift range 0.2 < z < 0.5, and < 0.09 for galaxies at\n0.0 < z < 1.2. The refined calibration procedure and\nphotometric redshift method will be described in detail\nelsewhere (Hsieh et al., in prep.)\n2.3. Sample Selection and Analysis\n\nThe goal of our study is to measure any statistical\ncolor difference between a sample of galaxies seen in\nthe background of clusters and a reference sample of\ngalaxies, presumably not affected by intervening dust.\n1\n\nhttp://deep.berkeley.edu/DR2/\n\n3\n\nWe first extracted only the galaxies with 0.5 < zph\n< 0.8 (i.e, at redshift larger than that of selected clusters) and \u03b4zph /(1 + zph ) < 0.06 (i.e., with good photometric redshift accuracy). A total of \u223c 90,000 galaxies satisfied these criteria. Each galaxy of our RCS\nsubset is defined by its photometric redshift zph and\nB, V, Rc , z \u2032 magnitudes (with the associated uncertainties \u03b4zph , \u03b4B, \u03b4V, \u03b4Rc and \u03b4z \u2032 ).\nOur samples were built by using a Monte Carlo\nmethod, in order to take into account the redshift and\nphotometric uncertainties. We repeated the process explained hereafter 100 times. Before checking its line of\nsight, we replaced any given galaxy by a 'new' galaxy\nwith:\nzph \u2192 zph + G(\u03b4zph ),\n(1)\nand\ni \u2212 j \u2192 (i + G(\u03b4i)) \u2212 (j + G(\u03b4j)),\n(2)\nwhere i and j are any two filters taken from (B, V, Rc , z \u2032 ),\nand G(x) is a random value following a Gaussian distribution with standard deviation x. Two independent\ncolors, B \u2212 Rc and V \u2212 z \u2032 , were derived.\nThe line of sight to each galaxy was investigated by\nchecking against the positions of all clusters in our RCS\ncluster subset. We constructed five samples, containing\nall galaxies with redshifts such that zph \u2212zclust > 0.3 and\nlocated at projected distances l < 1 \u00d7 R200 (sample a),\nl \u2208 [1 \u2212 2] \u00d7 R200 (sample b), l \u2208 [2 \u2212 3] \u00d7 R200 (sample c),\nl \u2208 [3 \u2212 4] \u00d7 R200 (sample d), and l \u2208 [6 \u2212 7] \u00d7 R200 (sample e), respectively, from a cluster center. A bootstrap\ntechnique (Efron 1979) was applied to rebuild each sample, by randomly picking out N times a galaxy amongst\nthe N galaxies of the sample. Each 'new' sample was further binned in each color with a bin resolution of \u03b4=0.05\nmagnitude. Fig.1 illustrates the redshift and color distributions obtained for one given Monte-Carlo+bootstrap\nrealization. We finally checked any color difference between two samples by progressively shifting the color distribution of one relatively to the other by a bin offset \u2206\n(\u2206 being an integer), and calculating the value:\nX\n(sample1(i \u2212 \u2206) \u2212 sample2(i))2 . (3)\n\u03c7(\u2206) =\ni\n\nThe color difference \u2206COL between the two samples was\nthen assumed to be the minimum value for \u03c7(\u2206) (i.e.,\nthat for which the two samples are most similar), calculated as:\nX 1\nX \u2206\u03b4\n/\n.\n(4)\n\u2206COL =\n2\n\u03c7 (\u2206)\n\u03c72 (\u2206)\n\u2206\n\n\u2206\n\nIn practice, we limited the shifts \u2206 between \u221210 to +10\nbins, thus exploring a color difference range \u22120.5 to +0.5\nmagnitude. For each Monte Carlo realization, we performed a total of 100 bootstrap runs, which allowed us\nto derive a statistical dispersion associated with \u2206COL .\nThe combination of Monte Carlo + bootstrap techniques allowed us (1) to take into account the redshift\nand photometric uncertainties, and (2) to derive the average color differences between the samples, with their\nassociated dispersion. To give some numbers, we counted\n\u223c 8, 000 galaxies in sample a, \u223c 23, 000 in sample\nb, \u223c 36, 000 in sample c, \u223c 47, 000 in sample d and\n\u223c 73, 000 in sample e. The final results for the color\ndifferences between the various samples are presented in\nTable 3.\n\n\f4\n\nMuller et al. 2008\n3. DISCUSSION\n\nOur results indicate that there is statistically no color\ndifference between the samples of background galaxies\nseen behind the inner part of clusters (< 1 \u00d7 R200 ) and\nin the periphery up to [6 \u2212 7] \u00d7 R200. We emphasize that\nwhile the color differences are derived from independent\nfilter pairs with independent calibration, the results in\ncolumns 2 and 3 of Table 3 are all consistent with no\nreddening, given the uncertainties. Assuming a Galactic\nextinction law, we convert the E(B \u2212 Rc ) and E(V \u2212\nz \u2032 ) values into visual extinction, AV , from the following\nrelations: AV = 1.9\u00d7E(B\u2212Rc) and AV = 1.9\u00d7 E(V \u2212z \u2032 )\n(taking the coefficients from Schlegel et al. 1998), and\ncalculate the weighted average of the two independent\nvalues (column 4 in Table 3). We end up with a visual\nextinction of <AV > = 0.004 \u00b1 0.010 when comparing\nthe sample of galaxies projected within 1 \u00d7 R200 and the\nreference sample of galaxies projected at [3 \u2212 4] \u00d7 R200\naway from the cluster centers.\nThe relation between the total mass of intracluster\ndust, Md , and average visual extinction, AV , within a\nradius Rclust can be expressed as (Whittek 1992):\n16\u03c0 AV rg \u03c1g 2\nMd =\nR\n,\n9 1.086 Qext clust\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the dust grains are characterized by their radius\nrg (\u223c 0.1\u03bcm), mass density \u03c1g (\u223c 1 g cm\u22123 ), and extinction efficiency factor Qext (\u223c 2). The values given in\nparenthesis are characteristic for standard silicate grains\n(Hildebrand 1983). There is, however, no guarantee that\nICM dust grains have similar properties. Should there\nbe dust with such properties and uniformly distributed\nwithin Rclust \u223c 1.5 Mpc (roughly corresponding in average to 1 \u00d7 R200 ) from the cluster center, the 3\u03c3 upper\nlimit on AV would yield a dust mass of Md \u223c 8 \u00d7 109\nM\u2299 .\nChelouche et al. (2007) have recently claimed the detection of ICM dust by studying both the photometric\nand spectroscopic properties of background quasars at\ndifferent projected distances from galaxy clusters, using\nSDSS data. They report reddening of few 10\u22123 magnitudes over large scale up to [6 \u2212 7] \u00d7 R200 . The slight\ndifference with respect to our results could be attributed\neither to systematic errors or to the fact that they used\nrelatively closer clusters 0.1 < z < 0.3. Despite a larger\nnumber of background sources in our data, our error bars\nare about 2 \u2212 3 times larger. This could be explained by\nthe fact that the color distribution of quasars is narrower\nthan that of galaxies.\nIndeed, under Gaussian probability distribution,\u221athe\nuncertainty on the mean can be expressed as \u03c3/ N ,\nwhere \u03c3 is the dispersion of the distribution, and N, the\nnumber of elements. The dispersion in color is \u223c 0.5\nfor SDSS quasars (see, e.g., Richards et al. 2001), and\n\u223c 2 for our galaxies samples (Fig.1). Therefore, with\nN = 8,000 background galaxies in our sample a, and N\n= 3,000 background quasars in Chelouche et al. (2007)\nstudy, we naturally end up with uncertainties \u223c 2.5\u00d7\nlarger in our case. The one way to improve our results\nwould then be to significantly increase the number of\nbackground galaxies, for example with a larger survey.\nWe note that, within a radius of 1 \u00d7 R200 , we get about\n20 background galaxies per cluster, whereas Chelouche\n\net al. (2007) count a total of about 3,000 quasars for\ntheir sample of 104 clusters, i.e., in average, less than\none background quasar per cluster.\nGiven the uncertainties associated with those measurements, it is still difficult to reach a definite conclusion\nabout the presence of dust in the intracluster medium.\nAll the studies based on the measurement of reddening\nof background sources (cf. Maoz 1995; Nollenberg et al.\n2003; Chelouche et al. 2007; and this work) agree with\nnull or very small average reddening, in contrast to previous counts of background clusters or quasars (Table\n1), which were probably severely affected by selection effects. At infrared or submillimeter wavelengths, on the\nother hand, only the combination of high angular resolution and sensitivity might help to clarify the claimed\ndetection by Stickel et al. (1998) and Montier & Giard\n(2005). Still, the task will not be eased by the large\nangular size of galaxy clusters, as, e.g., emission from\ndiffuse and extended ICM dust might be filtered out by\ninterferometers.\n4. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper, we report a search for the presence of\ndust in the intracluster medium. Our method relies on\nthe statistical measurement of the color differences between galaxies located in the background of a cluster and\nreference galaxies. We take advantage of data acquired\nwith the CFHT in the frame of the Red Sequence Cluster\nSurvey, providing us with deep and homogeneous catalogs of galaxies and galaxy clusters. For our purpose,\na major asset of these RCS data is the availability of\nphotometric redshifts for more than a million galaxies.\nWe extracted 458 clusters up to a redshift of 0.5, and\na total of \u223c 90, 000 galaxies, selected from their photometric redshift 0.5 < zph < 0.8 and with photometric\nredshift uncertainty \u03b4zph /(1 + zph) < 0.06. In particular,\nour selection criteria ensure low contamination by foreground galaxies and cluster members. Special attention\nwas given to the propagation of photometry and photometric redshift uncertainties, which were taken into account by a combination of Monte-Carlo and bootstrap\nmethods.\nA sample of about 8,000 galaxies projected within\n1 \u00d7 R200 of a cluster is compared to different reference\nsamples composed of galaxies projected at distances [12], [2-3], [3-4] and [6-7]\u00d7R200 from a cluster center. We\ndo not detect significant color differences between the\nfirst sample and the different references. Unless intracluster dust extends over scales larger than \u223c 10 Mpc\nin radius, we therefore conclude that the dust extinction is statistically low, with visual extinction <AV > =\n0.004 \u00b1 0.010 for the 458 RCS clusters with z < 0.5, corresponding to an upper dust mass limit of 8 \u00d7 109 M\u2299\nwithin 1 \u00d7 R200 . Given the uncertainties, our results are\nconsistent with the recent measurements of reddening of\nbackground quasars by galaxy clusters from Chelouche\net al. (2007).\nThe on going RCS2 survey, extending the RCS coverage to \u223c 1, 000 deg2 in four photometric bands with the\nCFHT MegaCam will soon be available. The observed\nsky surface will be multiplied by a factor of 30, providing a much larger number of background galaxies. These\nnew data could allow us to improve our measurements\nand compare the dust reddening towards clusters with\n\n\fSearching for ICM dust\ndifferent properties, such as richness, X-ray brightness\nor merging activity.\nBased on observations obtained at the Canada-FranceHawaii Telescope (CFHT) which is operated by the Na-\n\n5\n\ntional Research Council of Canada, the Institut National\ndes Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la\nRecherche Scientifique of France, and the University of\nHawaii.\n\nREFERENCES\nAnnis, J. & Jewitt, D., 1993, MNRAS, 264, 593\nArnaboldi, M., Freeman, K.
