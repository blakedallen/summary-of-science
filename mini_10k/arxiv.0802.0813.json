At this order, three-jet production is described to\nnext-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in perturbation theory while the two-jet rate is obtained at\nnext-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N3 LO). Our results yield an improved perturbative description of the dependence of jet multiplicity on the jet resolution parameter, ycut , particularly at small\nvalues of ycut .\nPACS numbers: 12.38.Bx, 13.66.Bc, 13.66.Jn, 13.87.-a\n\nJet observables in electron\u2013positron annihilation play\nan outstanding role in studying the dynamics of the\nstrong interactions, described by the theory of quantum\nchromodynamics (QCD, [1]). The initial experimental\nobservation of three-jet events at PETRA [2], in agreement with the theoretical prediction [3], provided first\nevidence for the gluon, and thus strong initial support for\nthe correctness of QCD. Subsequently the three-jet rate\nand related event shape observables were used for the\nprecise determination of the QCD coupling constant \u03b1s\n(see [4, 5] for a review), and four-jet observables helped\nsubstantially to confirm the gauge group structure of\nQCD by firmly establishing the gluon self-coupling [6].\nJets are defined using a jet algorithm, which describes\nhow to recombine the momenta of all hadrons in an event\nto form the jets. A jet algorithm consists of two ingredients: a distance measure and a recombination procedure. The distance measure is computed for each pair\nof momenta to select the pair with the smallest separation. This pair of momenta then is combined according\nto the recombination procedure into a joint momentum,\nif its separation is below a pre-defined resolution parameter ycut . Improving upon the JADE algorithm [7], which\nuses the pair invariant mass as distance measure, several\njet algorithms have been proposed for e+ e\u2212 collisions:\nDurham [8], Geneva [9] and Cambridge [10]. Among\nthose, the Durham algorithm has been the most widely\nused by experiments at LEP [11, 12, 13, 14] and SLD [15],\nas well as in the reanalysis of earlier data at lower energies from JADE [16].\nThe Durham jet algorithm clusters particles into jets\nby computing the distance measure\nyij,D =\n\n2 min(Ei2 , Ej2 )(1 \u2212 cos \u03b8ij )\n2\nEvis\n\n(1)\n\nfor each pair (i, j) of particles, Evis denotes the energy\nsum of all particles in the final state. The pair with the\nlowest yij,D is replaced by a pseudo-particle whose fourmomentum is given by the sum of the four-momenta of\nparticles i and j ('E' recombination scheme). This procedure is repeated as long as pairs with invariant mass\nbelow the predefined resolution parameter yij,D < ycut\n\nare found. Once the clustering is terminated, the remaining (pseudo-)particles are the jets. It is evident that a\nlarge value of ycut will ultimately result in the clustering\nall particles into only two jets, while higher jet multiplicities will become more and more frequent as ycut is\nlowered. In experimental jet measurements, one therefore studies the jet rates (jet cross sections normalized\nto the total hadronic cross section) as function of the jet\nresolution parameter ycut .\nThe theoretical prediction of jet cross sections is made\nwithin perturbative QCD, where the same jet algorithm\nis applied to the momenta of final state partons. The\nQCD description of jet production is either based on a\nfixed-order calculation, which uses exact parton-level matrix elements (including higher order corrections if available) for a given jet multiplicity, or by a parton shower,\nwhich is based on the leading-order matrix element for\ntwo-jet production only, and generates higher multiplicities in an iterative manner, thereby accounting only for\nthe leading logarithmic terms from parton-level processes\nwith higher multiplicity. Depending on the jet multiplicity, higher perturbative orders correspond to different\npowers of the QCD coupling constant: the leading order\nprediction for n-jet production is proportional to \u03b1sn\u22122 .\nSo far, fixed-order calculations were available up to nextto-next-to-leading order (NNLO) for two jets [17, 18, 19],\nup to next-to-leading order (NLO) for three [20, 21, 22]\nand four jets [23, 24, 25, 26]. For five and more jets, only\nleading order calculations were available [27, 28, 29]. For\njets involving massive quarks, NLO results are available\nfor three-jet final states [30].\nCalculations based on parton showers, incorporated\nin multi-purpose event generator programs [31, 32, 33],\nprovide a satisfactory description of multi-jet production\nrates. Since these programs contain many tunable phenomenological parameters, their predictive power is however very limited.\nIn this letter, we present the first calculation of NNLO\ncorrections to three-jet production and the next-to-nextto-next-to-leading order (N3 LO) corrections to two-jet\nproduction in e+ e\u2212 annihilation.

Experimental errors are too small to be visible on the figure.\n\nand the leading-order description of five-jet final states,\nthese are used for a fully consistent perturbative description of e+ e\u2212 \u2192 jets at order \u03b13s in perturbative QCD.\nThe calculation of the \u03b13s corrections for three-jet production is carried out using the newly developed partonlevel event generator program EERAD3 which contains the\nrelevant matrix elements with up to five external partons [27, 34, 35, 36]. Besides explicit infrared divergences\nfrom the loop integrals, the four-parton and five-parton\ncontributions yield infrared divergent contributions if one\nor two of the final state partons become collinear or soft.\nIn order to extract these infrared divergences and combine them with the virtual corrections, the antenna subtraction method [25, 37] was extended to NNLO level [38]\nand implemented for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 3 jets and related eventshape variables [39] into EERAD3. The analytical cancellation of all infrared divergences serves as a very strong\ncheck on the implementation.\nInitial results obtained with EERAD3 on NNLO corrections to event shape observables were reported in [40] and\napplied in the extraction of the strong coupling constant\nfrom LEP data in [41]. Since the program provides the\nfull kinematical information for each event, it can also\nbe used to simultaneously compute the production cross\nsections for three, four and five jets through to O(\u03b13s )\nfor any infrared-safe jet algorithm and as function of the\njet resolution parameter. The jet rates are then defined\nby normalizing the multi-jet cross sections to the total\nhadronic cross section computed at the same order.\nThe four-jet [23, 24, 25, 26] and five-jet rates [27] were\nknown previously to O(\u03b13s ). Our major new result is\nthe three-jet rate to this order, which corresponds to\nNNLO in the perturbative expansion. Figure 1 displays\nthe three-jet rate at LEP1 energy Q = MZ as function\nof the jet resolution ycut at LO, NLO, NNLO. At NNLO,\nthe denominator has been expanded, as described in [40]\n\nto contain only terms up to O(\u03b13s ) in the jet rate. The\ntheoretical uncertainty band is defined by varying the\nrenormalization scale \u03bc in the coupling constant in the interval MZ /2 < \u03bc < 2 MZ , and the world average value [5]\n\u03b1s (MZ ) = 0.1189 is used, consistently evolved to other\nscales at each order. The fixed-order theoretical predictions for three-jet rate become negative for small values of\nycut , where fixed order perturbation theory is not applicable due to the emergence of large logarithmic corrections\nat all orders, requiring resummation [8, 43]. We therefore\nrestrict our comparison to ycut > 10\u22124 , although data at\nlower jet resolution parameters are available.\nFor large values of ycut , ycut > 10\u22122 , the NNLO corrections turn out to be very small, while they become\nsubstantial for medium and low values of ycut . The maximum of the jet rate is shifted towards higher values of ycut\ncompared to NLO, and is in better agreement with the\nexperimental observation. The theoretical uncertainty is\nlowered considerably compared to NLO. Especially in the\nregion 10\u22121 > ycut > 10\u22122 , which is relevant for precision phenomenology, one observes a reduction by almost\na factor three, down to below two per cent relative uncertainty. Since the error band in this region is barely visible\nin the plot, we display the relative theoretical uncertainty\n\u03b4=\n\nmax\u03bc (\u03c3(\u03bc)) \u2212 min\u03bc (\u03c3(\u03bc))\n2\u03c3(\u03bc = MZ )\n\nat NLO and NNLO as an inset. The relative uncertainty\non the LO calculation is constant at 10.2%.\nThe fixed-order NNLO description is still above the\ndata at low jet resolution, where the convergence of the\nperturbative series is spoilt by large logarithms of ycut at\nall orders, and where a resummation should be carried\nout [8]. Furthermore, the theoretical parton-level prediction is compared to hadron-level data, thereby neglecting hadronization corrections, which may also account\nfor part of the discrepancy.\nTo compute the jet rates with different multiplicities,\nit is more appropriate to normalize all jet cross sections\nto the total hadronic cross section corrected to third order [42] in the QCD coupling constant, O(\u03b13s ). We consistently neglect numerically small QCD singlet contributions at this order, which were found to contribute at\nmost one per cent [42] to the total coefficient of the O(\u03b13s )\ncorrection, and which are equally small in the individual\njet multiplicities [23]. The total hadronic cross section\nis made up from the sum over all jet multiplicities. At\nO(\u03b13s ), this sum runs from two-jet through to five-jet final states, such that the corresponding jet rates must add\nto unity. Consequently, our calculation yields the N3 LO\nexpression for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 2 jets as a by-product. It is interesting to note that some earlier NNLO calculations of\nthe two-jet rate [18, 19] were essentially exploiting the\nsame feature at O(\u03b12s ).\nFigure 2 shows the parton-level theoretical predictions\nfor the jet fractions at first, second and third order in\nthe strong coupling constant, compared to experimental\nhadron-level data from ALEPH [11].\n\n\f3\n1\n\n1\n\n1\nR2 jet\n\nR2 jet\n\nR3 jet\n\n0.8\n\nR2 jet\n\nR3 jet\n\n0.8\n\nR3 jet\n\n0.8\n\nR4 jet\n\nR4 jet\nR5 jet\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n\u03b1s1 theory\n\n0.4\n\nALEPH data\n\nALEPH data\n\nQ = 206 GeV\n\nQ = 206 GeV\n\n0.4\n\n\u03b1s (MZ) = 0.1189\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0.6\n\n\u03b1s2 theory\n\nALEPH data\nQ = 206 GeV\n\n0.4\n\n\u03b1s (MZ) = 0.1189\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u03b1s (MZ) = 0.1189\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n-4\n\n\u03b1s3 theory\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\nlog10(ycut)\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\nlog10(ycut)\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\nlog10(ycut)\n\nFIG. 2: Jet rates at first, second and third order in the strong coupling constant, compared to data from ALEPH [11]. The\nrates are normalized to the total hadronic cross section at that order.\n\nBy comparing the three plots, we observe that there\nis systematically improved agreement for each of the jet\nrates as the order of perturbation theory increases. At\neach order a new multi-jet channel opens up, e.g. the\nfive-jet rate at O(\u03b13s ), which is positive definite and essentially monotonically increasing at small ycut . Since all\njet rates are normalized to unity, the new five-jet channel\nhas the effect of reducing the contribution to the two-jet,\nthree-jet and four-jet rates, in the region of log10 (ycut )\nwhere the five-jet rate contributes. One very clear effect is to cause the turnover in the four-jet rate (which\nis not present at O(\u03b12s )). A second effect is to add more\nstructure to the shape of the two- and three-jet rates,\nwhich lie much closer to the data for log10 (ycut ) < \u22122.5.\nOf course, the effect of the higher order corrections also\nextends to larger values of ycut , due to the different contributions of the two-loop virtual and virtual-radiation\ngraphs to the three- and four-jet rates, as well as the way\nthat the double radiation contribution interacts with the\njet algorithm, and through the normalization to the total\nhadronic cross section. This is visibly less dramatic, but\nby adding more structure to the theoretical prediction,\nenables a better description of the data.\nPrevious experimental studies of multi-jet production\nrates compared only with standard leading-order parton\nshower event generator programs, which yielded a good\ndescription of the data at the expense of large hadronization corrections [4, 11]. In the light of our new results,\nthis issue should be carefully reexamined within fixedorder perturbation theory.\nIn this letter, we reported on the NNLO QCD correc-\n\n[1] H. Fritzsch, M.

Rev.\n\ntions to the three-jet production rate at parton-level in\ne+ e\u2212 annihilation, which is the first genuine NNLO calculation of a jet production rate at particle colliders. We\nobserved that (hadron-level) experimental three-jet data\nare described considerably better in shape and normalization, and over a wider range in ycut , than at NLO.\nAt the same order in the strong coupling constant, \u03b13s ,\nwe describe four-jet production at NLO and five-jet production at LO, reproducing earlier results. By combining\nthose and normalizing to the total hadronic cross section\nat this order, we obtained the two-jet rate to N3 LO in\nperturbation theory as a by-product. We observe that\nwith increasing order in the strong coupling constant,\nthe multi-jet rates are better described over an increasing range of resolution parameters. Our results clearly\nhighlight how perturbative QCD successfully describes\njet production rates at the parton-level.\nAcknowledgments: Part of this work was carried\nout while the authors were attending the programme\n\"Advancing Collider Physics: From Twistors to Monte\nCarlos\" of the Galileo Galilei Institute for Theoretical\nPhysics (GGI) in Florence.
