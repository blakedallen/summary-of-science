In his contribution, Fano has explained the\nexistence of unpopulated frequencies in the continuum of\nionized states by diagonalizing the appropriate Hamiltonian. This effect occurs as a consequence of destructive\ninterference of two quantum ionization paths. This phenomenon occurring at specific frequencies (or for given\nionization states) is spoken of as the presence of 'Fano\nzeros'. Moreover, there might occur a strong narrowing\nof spectral peaks in the vicinity of such frequencies by\nvirtue of strong interference. This effect is sometimes\nreferred to as the 'confluence of bound-free coherences'\n[2]. These effects can be degraded to certain extent by,\ne.g., spontaneous emission of radiation [3\u20135], finite pump\nlaser bandwidth [6] or collisions [5]. In general, there exist n Fano zeros in an autoionization system with n discrete autoionizing levels [1, 7]. Generalizations including\nseveral mutually non-interacting continua has also been\ngiven [1, 8]. The presence of autoionizing levels also influences ionization dynamics under strong laser pumping\n[9]. Experimental observation of Fano spectral zeros has\nbeen reported, e.g., in [10]. The existence of discrete levels in autoionization systems can lead to transparency\nfor ultra-short pulses [11] or slowing-down of propagating light [12]. The dynamics of ionization can be even\ninfluenced by the Zeno or anti-Zeno effects [13]. A generalization to low-light quantum optical fields including\nthe Fock coherent or squeezed states has also been given\n[14, 15] and it has revealed additional interferences in\nphotoelectron ionization spectra stemming from the discrete energies of quantized optical fields. The studied\nionization quantum-path interference effects play an important role in spectroscopy in explaining asymmetric\nspectral profiles [16]. Similar quantum interference ef-\n\nfects can be found in many other fields of physics, both\nusing mass particles and photons. Among others, semiconductor hetero-structures or photonic waveguides can\nbe mentioned [17]. An extended list of references dealing\nwith autoionization can be found in [5, 7, 18].\nIn this work we continue the investigation of the influence of a neighbor atom to an ionization system and\nits long-time photoelectron ionization spectra. The influence is assumed to have the form of energy transfer\ncased, e.g., by the dipole-dipole interaction. Compared\nto [19], we additionally assume one discrete bound (autoionizing) state present in the ionization system. Similarly as in [19], the neighbor atom is modelled as a twolevel system that undergoes Rabi oscillations in a stationary optical field. These oscillations significantly influence conditional photoelectron spectra of the autoionization system. In these spectra, the so-called dynamical\nzeros occurring once per the Rabi period [19] have been\nfound. Frequencies in photoelectron ionization spectra\ncorresponding to both the Fano-like zeros (for weak optical pumping) and the dynamical zeros are studied using both analytical and numerical approaches. Molecular\ncondensates [20] as well as systems of quantum dots or\nother semiconductor hetero-structures [17] are suitable\ncandidates for the verification of the obtained results.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Sec. II brings\nthe model Hamiltonian, solution of the corresponding\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation and formulas for photoelectron ionization spectra. These spectra in their long-time limit are\ndiscussed in Sec. III. The frequencies of Fano-like zeros\nin the spectra are analyzed in Sec. IV using the method\nof canonical transformation. Sec. V is devoted to dynamical zeros. Conclusions are drawn in Sec. VI. Formulas\ngiving the frequencies of poles of the Lorentzian curves\nconstituting the photoelectron ionization spectra can be\nfound in Appendix A. A method for the determination\nof frequencies of the Fano as well as dynamical zeros is\ndeveloped in Appendix B.\n\n\f2\nthe Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian \u0124t\u2212a :\n\u273f\n\u273f\n\u272f\n\u2723\n\nJ\nV\nEa\n\nEb\n\u2732\n\u2732\n\n|1ia\n\n\u273b\n\nJab\n\n\u03bca \u03b1L\n|0ia\n\n\u25bc\n\n\u03bcb \u03b1 L\n\n|1ib\n\nE\n|E)\n\n\u03bc\u03b1L\n\n|0ib\n\nFIG. 1.

QUANTUM MODEL AND ITS\nPHOTOELECTRON IONIZATION SPECTRA\n\nThe considered ionization system (atom, molecule)\nwith one autoionizing level is assumed to interact with a\nneighbor two-level atom (molecule) by the dipole-dipole\ninteraction (for the scheme, see Fig. 1). Both the ionization system and the neighbor atom are under the influence of a stationary optical field. The Hamiltonian \u0124a\u2212i\nof the ionization system b with one autoionizing level can\nbe written in the form (h\u0304 = 1 is assumed, [21]):\nZ\n\u0124a\u2212i = Eb |1ibb h1| + dEE|E)(E|\nZ\n+ dE (V |E) b h1| + H.c.)\n+ [\u03bcb \u03b1L exp(\u2212iEL t)|1ibb h0| + H.c.]\nZ\n+ dE [\u03bc\u03b1L exp(\u2212iEL t)|E) b h0| + H.c.] . (1)\n\nIn Eq. (1), the symbol Eb means the excitation energy\nfrom the ground state |0ib into the excited bound state\n|1ib of atom b. The continuum of the autoionization system b is formed by the states |E) with their energies E.\nThe coupling constant V describes the Coulomb configuration interaction between the states |1ib and |E) inside\nthe continuum. The dipole moments \u03bcb and \u03bc characterize the optical excitation of the corresponding states; \u03b1L\nmeans an optical-field amplitude oscillating at the frequency EL . The symbol H.c. stands for the Hermitian\nconjugated term.\nA neighbor two-level atom a interacting with the optical field through the dipole moment \u03bca is described by\n\n\u0124t\u2212a = Ea |1iaa h1| + [\u03bca \u03b1L exp(\u2212iEL t)|1iaa h0| + H.c.] .\n(2)\nThe energy Ea of the excited bound state |1ia of the atom\na is measured relative to the energy of the ground state\n|0ia . The ground states of atoms a and b are assumed to\nhave the same energy that is chosen to be zero.\nThe energy transfer [20] caused by the dipole-dipole\ninteraction between the two-level atom a and the autoionizing system b is characterized by the Hamiltonian\ne\n\u0124trans\n:\ne\n\u0124trans\n= [Jab |1ibb h0||0iaa h1| + H.c.]\nZ\n+ dE [J|E) b h0||0iaa h1| + H.c.] .\n\n(3)\n\nIn this interaction, one electron looses its energy when\nreturning from the excited state into the ground state,\nwhereas the other one absorbs this energy and moves\nfrom the ground state into its own excited state. The\nconstants Jab and J quantify the strength of this interaction.\nA general quantum state of two electrons at the atoms\na and b can be written in the following form appropriate\nto the rotating frame:\n|\u03c8i(t) = c00 (t)|0ia |0ib + c10 (t)|1ia |0ib\n+ c01 (t)|0ia |1ib + c11 (t)|1ia |1ib\nZ\n+ dEd0 (E, t)|0ia |E)\nZ\n+ dEd1 (E, t)|1ia |E).\n\n(4)\n\nThe time-dependent coefficients c00 , c10 , c01 , c11 , d0 (E),\nand d1 (E) characterize the state |\u03c8i at an arbitrary time.\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation with the Hamiltonian\ne\ncan be written as a system of dif\u0124a\u2212i + \u0124t\u2212a + \u0124trans\nferential equations for the coefficients of decomposition\nwritten in Eq.

(13) gives the initial conditions.\nWe assume here that electrons at both the two-level atom\na and the autoionizing system b are initially in their\nground states, i.e. ce (0) = (1, 0, 0, 0).\nIn deriving the long-time photoelectron ionization\nspectra, the long-time form of the evolution matrices Uek\ndefined in Eq. (14) is needed:\nh\ni\ni\u03b4jl exp[i(\u03bek \u2212 E)t]\n(E, t) =\n.\n(16)\nUe,lt\nk\nE \u2212 \u039bM e ,j \u2212 \u03bek\njl\n\n(17)\n\nThe intensities I0st and I1st denote the steady-state parts\nof the corresponding spectra, whereas the intensity I osc\ndescribes the magnitude of harmonic oscillations between the spectra I0lt and I1lt . The symbol \u03c6 stands for\na spectrally dependent phase. These temporal oscillations at the Rabi frequency in the conditional long-time\nphotoelectron ionization spectra can be observed using\nthe time-resolved spectroscopy of photo-ionized electrons\n[21]. If the temporal resolution is not sufficient, only the\nsteady-state parts I0st (E) and I1st (E) are experimentally\navailable. We note that the Rabi oscillations can alternatively be observed in the long-time behavior of the\ntwo-level atom a provided that a suitable basis in the\ncontinuum of ionized states of atom b is chosen and a\nconditional measurement into its basis functions is considered.\nThe form of long-time spectra I0lt and I1lt as written in\nEq. (17) guarantees that the overall long-time photoelectron ionization spectrum I lt (E) = I0lt (E, t) + I1lt (E, t) is\ntime independent;\nI lt (E) = I0st (E) + I1st (E).\n\n(18)\n\nIn the long-time photoelectron ionization spectra,\nthere may occur frequencies that cannot be populated.\nIf a given frequency EF cannot be excited for arbitrary\ntimes, we have a Fano zero obeying the following equation:\nI lt (EF ) = 0.\n\n(19)\n\nAccording to Eq. (18) a Fano zero at the frequency EF\nis present only if I0st (EF ) = 0 and I1st (EF ) = 0.\nIt may also happen that the long-time spectral components I0st , I1st , and I osc fulfil one or both of the following\nequations for specific frequencies ED :\nIjst (ED ) = I osc (ED ),\n\nj = 0, 1.\n\n(20)\n\nThis means that the long-time photoelectron ionization\nspectrum I0lt (E, tD ) [or I1lt (E, tD )] reaches zero at suitable time instants tD . Such a frequency ED corresponds\nto a dynamical zero that periodically occurs with the\nRabi period 2\u03c0/\u03b4\u03be [19]. We note that dynamical zeros\noccur, because of the interaction of the autoionization\nsystem b with the two-level atom a. The frequencies of\n\n\f4\ndynamical zeros depend, in general, on the state of the\ntwo-level atom a. However, if the two-level atom a is\nresonantly pumped, these frequencies in the long-time\nphotoelectron spectra I0lt and I1lt coincide. We note that\na Fano zero also obeys the conditions in Eq. (20) defining\na dynamical zero.\n\nIII.\n\nPHOTOELECTRON IONIZATION\nSPECTRA\n\nThe long-time photoelectron ionization spectra of the\nFano model as well as the ionization system interacting\nwith a neighbor atom studied in [19] are useful in the\nanalysis of the spectra belonging to the autoionization\nsystem interacting with a neighbor. That is why, we\nrefer to them in the discussion below.\nThe general form of amplitude photoelectron ionization spectra d(E, t) of the interacting autoionization system is composed of eight Lorentzian curves as the formulas in Eqs. (12), (13), and (16) show. These curves\nare located at different frequencies Er in the complex\nplane E. The complex frequencies Er differ in magnitudes of their complex parts and so they lead to peaks\nof different widths on the real axis E. In more detail,\nthere exist two groups of four of the frequencies Er (see\nAppendix A). The frequencies Er from the second group\nare just those of the first group shifted by the Rabi frequency \u03b4\u03be. However, as numerical results have revealed,\nonly four frequencies Er (two pairs) are important for the\ndetermination of shapes of the photoelectron ionization\nspectra I lt in two regimes discussed here and assuming\nresonant pumping of atom a.\nIn order to demonstrate the main features found in\nthe photoelectron ionization spectra, we first consider\nthe comparable 'ionization' interactions at atoms a and b\n(V \u2248 J, Jab ). The regime with V \u226b J, Jab appropriate\nfor molecular condensates is analyzed subsequently.\nAnalyzing the long-time photoelectron ionization spectra, we first consider a weak direct ionization (qa , qb \u226b 1,\nfor the definition of parameters, see the caption to Fig. 2).\nOn assuming equally strong indirect ionization paths\nthrough the states |1ia and |1ib (qa = qb ), typical symmetric two-peak photoelectron ionization spectra are observed [see Fig. 2(a)]. We note that one should keep in\nmind that the ionization process through the state |1ia\nis not typical, since energy transfer without real transfer\nof electrons occurs. The greater the pumping parameter\n\u03a9 is, the larger is the distance between two peaks that\nform an Autler-Townes doublet already discussed in the\nliterature about autoionization processes (see, e.g., [8]\nand references therein). These conclusions can be drawn\nfrom the positions of eight frequencies Er in the complex\nplane E discussed above. Their real parts are plotted\nin Fig. 3(a) as a function of the pumping parameter \u03a9.\nThey create pairs with equal imaginary parts and mutual frequency difference equal to the Rabi frequency \u03b4\u03be.\nValues of the imaginary parts of frequencies Er indicate\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\nFIG. 2. Long-time photoelectron ionization spectra I lt for\n(a) qa = qb = 100 and (b) qa = qb = 1 for different values of\npumping parameter \u03a9: \u03a9 = 0.1 (solid curve), \u03a9 = 1 (solid\ncurve with \u2217), and \u03a9 = 2 (solid curve with \u25b3); \u03b3a = \u03b3b = 1,\nEa = Eb = EL = 1, Jab = 0; qa = \u03bc\u221aa /(\u03c0\u03bcJ \u2217 ), \u03b3a = \u03c0|J|2 ,\nqb = \u03bcb /(\u03c0\u03bcV \u2217 ), \u03b3b = \u03c0|V |2 , \u03a9 = 4\u03c0\u0393(Q + i)\u03bc\u03b1L , \u0393 =\n\u03b3a + R\u03b3b , Q = (\u03b3a qa + \u03b3b qb )/\u0393. Spectra are normalized such\nthat dEI lt (E) = 1.\n\nthat only two pairs considerably participate in forming\nthe long-time photoelectron spectra I lt . Moreover, the\nfrequencies Er of these two pairs nearly coincide [see\nFig. 3(a)]. This explains, why the photoelectron ionization spectra I lt are composed only of two peaks. We note\nthat a two-peak structure is preserved even in the limit of\nweak optical pumping. The Fano-like zero at frequency\nE = EL can even be revealed for \u03a9 \u2192 0, see Sec. IV later.\nThis distinguishes spectral profiles of the autoionization\nsystem compared to the Fano model [see Fig. 2(a) in [19]]\nhaving one central peak for weak optical pumping. Similarly as in the Fano model, the peaks broaden with the\nincreasing pumping parameter \u03a9.\nIf the strength of direct ionization path is comparable\nwith those of two indirect ionization paths, the structure\nof long-time photoelectron ionization spectra is much\nricher [see Fig. 2(b)]. We can identify two sharp nearly\nsymmetrically positioned peaks in graphs in Fig. 2(b),\nwith the mutual distance roughly given by the Rabi frequency \u03b4\u03be. Contrary to two symmetrically positioned\n\n\f5\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\nFIG. 3.

Roots\nare divided into four pairs (plotted with different styles of\ncurves) with equal imaginary parts and mutual frequency difference \u03b4\u03be. Two pairs (solid curves with \u25b3 and \u25e6) have small\nimaginary parts and are thus visible in the spectra I lt shown\nin Fig. 2. The values of other parameters are given in caption\nto Fig. 2.\n\npeaks observed for large values of qa , qb in Fig. 2(a), the\nwidths of these peaks practically do not depend on the\npumping parameter \u03a9. Two additional much broader\npeaks have been observed in the ionization spectra in\nFig. 2(b) for larger values of pumping parameter \u03a9. The\nfirst peak can be found in the area around EL , the second one occurs roughly one Rabi frequency \u03b4\u03be on the\nleft-hand side of the first peak. If the pumping parameter \u03a9 increases, widths of both peaks and the distance\nbetween the peaks constituting the Autler-Townes doublet increases. Moreover, the analysis of behavior of\neight complex frequencies Er has shown that only two\nfrequency pairs are located near the real axis of complex frequency E and thus build the spectrum I lt [see\nFig. 3(b)]. This explains why the peaks are mutually\nshifted roughly by one Rabi frequency. We note that the\nbehavior of the second two peaks resembles that found for\nthe two peaks in the long-time photoelectron spectrum\nof the ionization system interacting with a neighbor in\n\n[19] [compare Fig. 3(b) in [19]].\nIf indirect ionization including atom a prevails over the\ntwo remaining ionization channels, the long-time photoelectron ionization spectra are composed of two symmetrically positioned peaks. Moreover, the probability to\nionize the state with the frequency Ea is practically zero\n[see Fig. 4(a)]. The greater the pumping parameter \u03a9\nis, the larger is the distance between two peaks and the\npeaks are broader. This behavior is qualitatively similar\nto that found for two side-peaks in the spectra of the ionization system interacting with a neighbor investigated in\n[19] [compare Fig. 2(b) in [19]]. However, states with frequencies in the middle of the spectrum are only weakly\noccupied due to the interference with the additional ionization path coming through the autoionizing state |1ib .\nWhen the autoionization exploiting state |1ib is dominant, the Autler-Townes splitting of the photoelectron\nionization spectrum [22] naturally occurs, as documented\nin Fig. 4(b). Even a weak indirect ionization based on the\npresence of neighbor atom a is sufficient to split the ionization peak typical of smaller values of the pumping parameter \u03a9 into two symmetrically positioned side-peaks.\nSymmetric two-peak photoelectron ionization spectra are\nthus observed independently of the value of pumping parameter \u03a9. The greater the pumping parameter \u03a9 is, the\nmore distant and broader are the peaks.\nIn molecular condensates, the dipole-dipole interaction\nbetween the neighbor molecules has typical energies 1 10 meV, whereas energies in eV characterize the Coulomb\nconfiguration interaction. The ratio \u03b3a /\u03b3b thus equals\n10\u22124 \u2212 10\u22126 in this case. As the dipole-dipole interaction\nis weak (\u03b3a \u226a 1), we are in the regime of qa \u226b 1 assuming comparable values of the dipole moments \u03bca and \u03bc.\nThe role of the state |1ia in forming the photoelectron\nionization spectra is important provided that the optical pumping dipole and dipole-dipole interactions have\ncomparable strengths. This occurs only for weaker optical pumping. The needed pumping amplitudes \u03b1L are\nthus by two or three orders of magnitude lower compared\nto those used in typical ionization experiments. An example of the dependence of the long-time photoelectron\nionization spectra on the pumping parameter \u03a9 is shown\nin Fig. 5. We can see in Fig. 5(a) that the presence of\nmolecule a leads to splitting of the spectral profile into\ntwo narrow peaks for smaller values of the pumping parameter \u03a9. Widths of these peaks broaden, their mutual distance increases and their central frequencies shift\ntowards the lower frequencies as the values of pumping\nparameter \u03a9 increase. However, the peaks are gradually absorbed into an asymmetric spectral profile found\nfor larger values of pumping parameter \u03a9 [see Fig. 5(b)]\nand being typical for the Fano model with one autoionization level at molecule b. The role of molecule a in the\nformation of ionization spectra is thus negligible for sufficiently large values of the pumping parameter \u03a9. On the\nother hand, the interaction with molecule a substantially\nmodifies spectral profiles for smaller values of pumping\nparameter \u03a9, as the comparison of curves in Fig. 5 and\n\n\f6\n\n(a)\nFIG. 6.

On using the formulas written\nin Sec. II, temporal aspects of forming the photoelectron\nionization spectra can also be addressed. As the time t\nincreases, the initially flat photoelectron ionization spectrum is gradually 'focused' into its long-time shape. Naturally, the creation of sharper features in the long-time\n\nThe Fano (Fano-like) and dynamical zeros belong to\nthe most important features of the long-time photoelectron ionization spectra. The form of these spectra built\nfrom up to eight Lorentzian curves [see Eqs. (12), (13),\nand (16)] allows to draw general conclusions about the\nnumber of Fano and dynamical zeros (see Appendix B).\nIt also allows to develop a numerical method for finding\nfrequencies of these zeros. According to this analysis, no\nmore than three Fano zeros can exist.\nOur investigations have revealed only one Fano zero\n(present for arbitrarily strong pumping) under specific\nconditions. In the limit of weak optical pumping, two\nFano-like zeros have been identified.\nAs for the Fano zero, its frequency EF as well as conditions for its observation can be revealed using a suitable\ncanonical transformation [23]. From the physical point\nof view, this Fano zero may occur only provided that\ncompletely destructive interference between two ionization paths at the atom b occurs as discovered in [1]. In\nour model, we have two additional ionization paths containing the energy transfer from the excited state |1ia of\nthe atom a. In more detail, the first path contains direct energy transfer (J) into the state |EF ), whereas the\nsecond additional path includes energy transfer between\nthe states |1ia and |1ib (Jab ) and the Coulomb configurational interaction (V ). These two additional ionization\npaths can also cancel each other under suitable conditions. A detailed analysis [23] has shown that the state\n|EF ) in the continuum is completely decoupled from both\n\n\f7\n|0ia |1ib , and |0ia |E):\n\u273f\n\u273f\n\u272f\n\u2723\n\nJ\nEa\n\n\u2732\n\u2732\n\u2768\n\n|1ia |0ib\n\nJab\n\nEb\n\nV\n\u25bc |0ia |1ib\n\n\u03bcb \u03b1L\n\nE\n|0ia |E)\n\n\u03bca \u03b1 L\n|0ia |0ib\n\nFIG. 7.

In this limit, the probability of\nhaving the states |1ia |1ib and |1ia |E) describing two excited or ionized electrons is negligibly small compared to\nthe other probabilities.

DYNAMICAL ZEROS IN LONG-TIME\nPHOTOELECTRON IONIZATION SPECTRA\n\nThe analysis contained in Appendix B reveals that\nup to 15 dynamical zeros can exist. Their frequencies\nED can be determined along the recipe described in Appendix B. We should note that frequencies ED of two\nof the dynamical zeros coincide with the frequencies EF\nof the Fano-like zeros discussed in Sec. IV in the limit\nof weak optical pumping. If we plot the normalized frequencies (ED \u2212 Eb )/\u0393 of dynamical zeros as functions of\nthe pumping parameter \u03a9, we arrive at graphs similar\nin shape to those appearing in the model of ionization\nsystem interacting with a neighbor (see Fig. 6 in [19]).\nGraphs obtained for the analyzed model are in general\nmore complex. However, creation and annihilation of dynamical zeros in pairs represents their most typical feature. As an example, the graphs corresponding to the\nvalues of parameters defined in the caption to Fig. 2 are\nshown in Fig. 8. They demonstrate the 'creation' and\n'annihilation' of dynamical zeros is pairs. However, dynamical zeros can emerge even in greater numbers. This\nis documented in Fig. 9 where even five dynamical zeros\noccur with frequency ED = Eb for \u03a9 = 0 for values of parameters typical for molecular condensates. Similarly as\nin the long-time photoelectron ionization spectra of the\nionization system interacting with a neighbor [19], splitting of the normalized frequencies (ED \u2212Eb )/\u0393 appropriate to the spectra I0lt and I1lt is observed for non-resonant\npumping of the two-level atom a (Ea 6= EL ). The symmetry \u03a9 \u2194 \u2212\u03a9 mentioned in [19] is also preserved in the\nanalyzed autoionization system.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe long-time photoelectron ionization spectra of an\nautoionization system interacting with a neighbor twolevel atom have been investigated in several distinct\nregimes. They typically consist of several peaks with\ncentral positions and spectral widths depending on the\npumping strength. As a consequence of interference of\n\n\f9\nlong-time photoelectron ionization spectra conditioned\nby the state of the neighbor two-level atom exhibit permanent Rabi oscillations. Spectral dynamical zeros observed once in the Rabi period have been revealed in\nthese spectra. The frequencies of these dynamical zeros\ndepending on the strength of optical pumping as well as\nthe projected state of the neighbor two-level atom have\nbeen analyzed.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n(a)\n\nSupport by the projects 1M06002, COST OC\n09026, and Operational Program Research and Development for Innovations - European Social Fund (project\nCZ.1.05/2.1.00/03.0058) of the Ministry of Education of\nthe Czech Republic as well as the project IAA100100713\nof GA AV \u010cR is acknowledged.\n\nAppendix A: Determination of poles of the\nLorentzian curves giving photoelectron spectra\n\n(b)\nFIG. 8.
