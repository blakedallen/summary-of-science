By considering interaction energies between A-A\nand A-B pairs of particles that occupy nearest-neighbour cells of the hexagonal lattice, we have derived an exact solution for the\nconsidered model system having established a mapping correspondence with the two-dimensional Ising model on its dual triangular\nlattice. Altogether, six different types of coexistence curves including those with reentrant miscibility regions (i.e. closed-loop coexistence\ncurves) were found in dependence on the relative strength between both coupling constants.\nKeywords: binary mixture; phase separation; Lin-Taylor model; reentrant miscibility.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nPhase equilibria of binary liquid mixtures are subject of immense research interest since closed loops\nof immiscibility were experimentally observed in the nicotine-water mixture (1) and later on, in several\naqueous solutions of the 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-methylpiperidine (2; 3; 4), \u03b1- and \u03b2-picoline (5; 6; 7), 2,4and 2,6-dimethylpyridine (4; 8), the glycerol-guaiacol mixture (9), and also in many polymeric blends\n(10). It is noteworthy that an existence of the closed-loop coexistence curves with both upper (TU ) as\nwell as lower (TL ) critical solution temperatures evidently contradicts with intuitive expectations based on\nthermodynamical description of demixing, which predicts, on the contrary, a bell-shaped coexistence curve\nterminating at a single TU instead of having an island of immiscibility. Early explanation of this remarkable\nand rather unexpected phenomenon has been suggested by Hirschfelder, Stevenson and Eyring (11) who\nassociated an appearance of the reentrant miscibility with a presence of highly orientation-dependent\nforces, such as hydrogen bonding, which becomes rather inefficient above a certain critical temperature. In\naddition, if directional bonding occurs between like as well as unlike particles and the sum of interaction\nenergies for pairs of like particles is simultaneously greater than for pairs of unlike particles, the binary\nmixture may even phase separate at low temperatures to yield an usual bell-shaped coexistence curve\nwith the low-temperature TU below an additional closed loop. Although one meets with such an intriguing\nsituation rather rarely because freezing transitions usually camouflage the lowest TU , the aqueous solution\nof 2-butanol provides a striking example of the binary mixture with the closed loop above the bell-shaped\ncoexistence curve (12; 13; 14; 15).\nSo far, different lattice models of liquid mixtures have been proposed and dealt with in order to bring\nan insight into a reentrant miscibility phenomenon (10). Even though all lattice models provide somewhat\noversimplified picture of the liquid mixtures, some of the lattice models have already proved their worth due\nto their capability to explain the reentrant miscibility of hydrogen-bonded liquid mixtures (16; 17; 18).

Stre\u010dka et al.\n\nof theoretical predictions for a closed-loop formation were indeed based on the lattice-statistical models\nnaturally describing the directional character of highly orientationally dependent forces and moreover,\nthe lattice models can be rather easily treated using relatively precise Bethe-Guggenheim quasichemical\napproximation (19; 20; 21) or Migdal-Kadanoff approach formulated on the basis of renormalization group\ntheory (22; 23; 24; 25; 26). Besides, there even exist few exactly solvable lattice models, such as FrenkelLouis model (32) or Lin-Taylor model (LTM) (33; 34), which give qualitatively correct results for a phase\nseparation without being affected by any approximation. It is noteworthy, however, that more complete\nunderstanding of the reentrant miscibility has been achieved by exploring off-lattice continuum models,\nwhich can be treated within the perturbation theory of Wertheim (27; 28; 29) or the Gibbs-ensemble\nMonte-Carlo simulation technique (30; 31).\nIn the present article, we shall treat one particular example of LTM recently remarkably generalized\nby Romero-Enrique and co-workers (35; 36; 37; 38; 39). Among other matters, the generalized LTM has\nproved its usefulness in elucidating the reentrant miscibility as it has provided a plausible explanation of\nits microscopic origin. Even if the procedure worked out previously by Romero-Enrique et al. (36) is rather\ngeneral and contains our version of the model only as a special case, the numerical results reported on\npreviously were mostly restricted to LTM on a square lattice, which is a rather exceptional case of the\nself-dual lattice. In this respect, we shall therefore examine here the phase separation in the binary mixture\nof large hexagonal particles and small triangular ones, which are allowed to occupy basic unit cells of the\nhexagonal lattice. As we shall see hereafter, this model also exhibits the same substantial diversity of phase\ndiagrams as remarked by Romero-Enrique and co-workers (36) and all available scenarios for coexistence\ncurves including those with a closed loop of immiscibility will be indeed confirmed.\nThe organization of this paper is as follows. The foundations of the generalized LTM on the hexagonal\nlattice and basic steps of the exact method are given in the section 2. Section 3 deals with the most interesting numerical results obtained for the phase diagrams and coexistence curves. Finally, some conclusions\nare mentioned in the section 4.\n\n2\n\nGeneralized Lin-Taylor model (LTM)\n\nLet us begin by recalling foundations of the generalized LTM on the hexagonal lattice. Assuming that the\nbinary mixture consists of two kind of species, the large hexagonal particles A and the small triangular\nones B, LTM on the hexagonal lattice can be defined through the following rules: (i) each hexagonal unit\ncell consists of six triangular sub-units; (ii) none of A-A and A-B pairs can occupy the same hexagon; (iii)\nthe small particles B can occupy the cells left empty by the large particles A; (iv) each triangular subunit can be occupied by at most one particle B; (v) pairwise interactions \u03b5AA and \u03b5AB exist between the\nnearest-neighbouring A-A and A-B pairs sharing a common edge (Fig. 1). Next, we shall refer to \u03bcA and\n\u03bcB as to the chemical potentials relative to the particles A and B, respectively. For further convenience,\nlet us also define fugacities of both the particles by\nzA,B = exp(\u03b2\u03bcA,B ),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b2 = 1/(kB T ), kB is Boltzmann's constant and T absolute temperature. The grand-canonical partition function of this binary liquid mixture can be written in the form of a sum taken over all occupation\nconfigurations {ni } available for a given system\n\u039e=\n\nX\n\n{ni }\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\nX\nX\nni nj \u039eB ({ni }).\nni \u2212 \u03b2\u03b5AA\nexp \u03b2\u03bcA\ni\n\n(2)\n\n(i,j)\n\nAbove, ni = 1, 0 labels occupation number of the basic unit cell (hexagon),\nP whereas ni = 1 if ith hexagon\nis occupied by the large particle A, otherwise\nni = 0. The summation i runs over all basic unit cells of\nP\nthe hexagonal lattice and the other one (i,j) is performed over all pairs of nearest-neighbour unit cells. If\nthe configuration of large hexagonal particles A is fixed, the grand-canonical partition function \u039eB ({ni })\n\n\fOctober 15, 2018\n\n1:41\n\nMolecular Physics\n\nstrecka\n3\n\nInvestigation of phase separation within the generalized Lin-Taylor model\n\nof the small particles B can be expressed as follows\n\u039eB ({ni }) = (1 + zB )MF (1 + zB e\u2212\u03b2\u03b5AB )MI .\n\n(3)\n\nHere, MF (MI ) denotes the total number of triangular sub-units available for occupancy to the small\nparticles B, which have (not) a common edge with the large particles A. When taking into account the\nlattice geometry, both the numbers can easily be evaluated in terms of the occupation numbers\nMF = 6\n\nX\ni\n\nni \u2212 2\n\nMI = 6N \u2212 12\n\nX\n\nni nj ,\n\n(4)\n\n(i,j)\n\nX\n\nni + 2\n\ni\n\nX\n\nni nj ,\n\n(5)\n\n(i,j)\n\nwhere N labels the total number of the lattice cells (hexagons). At this stage, the grand-canonical partition\nfunction of the binary mixture can be mapped onto an one-component lattice-gas model for the species A\nby substituting (3), (4) and (5) into the relation (2) and thus, performing a summation over the occupation\nvariables relative to the species B\n\u039e = (1 + zB )6N\n\nX\n\n{ni }\n\no\nn\nX\nni nj\nexp [\u2212\u03b2\u03b5AA \u2212 2 ln(1 + zB e\u2212\u03b2\u03b5AB ) + 2 ln(1 + zB )]\n(i,j)\n\nn\n\nx exp [\u03b2\u03bcA + 6 ln(1 + zB e\u2212\u03b2\u03b5AB ) \u2212 12 ln(1 + zB )]\n\nX\n\no\n\nni .\n\n(6)\n\ni\n\nThe equality (6) proves that the grand-canonical partition function can be calculated from the equivalent lattice gas model with the renormalized pair interaction and shifted chemical potential. Next, the\ntransformation between the occupation number (ni = 1, 0) and Ising spin variable (si = \u00b11)\nni = (1 + si )/2,\n\n(7)\n\nestablishes a mapping relationship between the model under investigation and the spin- 12 Ising model\non the dual triangular lattice. As a consequence of this, the grand-canonical partition function can be\nexpressed through the partition function of the Ising model on the triangular lattice\nN\n\n2 \u22123\u03b2\u03b5AA\n(1 + zB )6 (1 + zB e\u2212\u03b2\u03b5AB )6 ] 4 Ztriang (R, H).\n\u039e = [zA\ne\n\n(8)\n\nNote that the mapping parameters R and H stand for the effective coupling constant and effective magnetic\nfield in the associated spin- 21 Ising model on the triangular lattice\n\u0011\n(1 + zB )2\n1 \u0010 \u2212\u03b2\u03b5AA\nln e\n4\n(1 + zB e\u2212\u03b2\u03b5AB )2\n\u0011\nzA\n1 \u0010\n.\nH = ln e\u22123\u03b2\u03b5AA\n2\n(1 + zB )6\nR=\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\nIt is worthwhile to remark that only the requirement of zero effective field (H = 0) in the equivalent\nIsing model ensures a possible existence of the phase separation in the considered LTM. As a result, the\nnecessary (but not sufficient) condition allocating the coexistence region between two phases of different\ncomposition relates two fugacities of the large and small particles through zA = e3\u03b2\u03b5AA (1 + zB )6 .\nNotice that the mapping relation (8) represents a central result of our calculation as it formally completes\nan exact solution for the grand-canonical partition function \u039e with regard to the known exact result of the\npartition function of the triangular Ising model (40; 41).

In this respect, the equation (16) can serve for determining the effective coupling\nparameter R by selecting T , \u03b5AA and \u03b5AB at fixed value of pressure. A subsequent substitution of the\neffective coupling R into the equation (15) then enables a simple calculation of the fugacities (the fugacity\nof large particles is connected to the one of small particles due to an unconditional validity of the zero-field\ncondition). With all this in mind, the composition of binary liquid mixture can be consequently calculated\nusing the set of equations (11)-(13).\n\n2.2\n\nCritical behaviour\n\nAccording to the mapping relation (8), the binary mixture becomes critical if, and only if, the effective\ncoupling parameter of the associated Ising model approaches its critical value.

It is worthy to mention that the\ndisplayed coexistence curves are obtained by cutting concentration-temperature slices at fixed pressure, i.e.\na situation which fully corresponds experimental conditions by performing studies of the phase separation.\nIt directly follows from the equation (15) that the phase separation into A-rich and B-rich phases might in\nprinciple appear either if \u03b5AA > 0, \u03b5AB /\u03b5AA > 0.5, or \u03b5AA < 0 (arbitrary \u03b5AB ). In what follows, we shall\ntreat those special cases in several sub-sections.\n3.1\n\nRepulsive interaction \u03b5AA > 0\n\nIf the pair interaction between the particles A is repulsive, the coexistence then possibly occurs just as\nthe interaction between the A-B pairs is likewise repulsive and simultaneously, the repulsion energy \u03b5AB is\nstronger than a half of the repulsion energy \u03b5AA , i.e. \u03b5AB /\u03b5AA > 0.5. The phase diagram for this particular\ncase is depicted in Fig. 2a in the form of Tc \u2212 pc dependence. The region inherent to the coexistence\nof the A-rich and B-rich phases can be located above the displayed curves, while below them both the\ncomponents become perfectly miscible. It is quite obvious from Fig. 2a that the phase separation occurs\nonly above a certain boundary pressure pb /\u03b5AA = 3, which is needed for overcoming the repulsive force\nbetween the pairs of particles A. On the other hand, the mixture becomes perfectly miscible independently\nof the ratio \u03b5AB /\u03b5AA below this pressure value. It can be also readily understood from Fig. 2a that the\nstronger the repulsion energy between the A-B pairs, which means, the stronger the ratio \u03b5AB /\u03b5AA , the\nhigher the critical temperature at which the phase coexistence disappears at a given pressure. Next, the\nc along the critical lines from Fig.\nlines depicted in Fig. 3a illustrate changes of the critical concentration XA\n1\nc\n2a. As one can see, the critical concentration achieves XA = 6 regardless of \u03b5AB /\u03b5AA when approaching\nthe lowest pressure pb at which the phase separation appears. For completeness, three typical coexistence\ncurves are shown in Fig. 4a for \u03b5AB /\u03b5AA = 1 fixed and several values of pressure. As it can be clearly seen,\none finds the typical bell-shaped coexistence curves irrespective of the pressure strength.\n3.2\n\nAttractive interaction \u03b5AA < 0\n\nNow, let us examine the case when the pairwise interaction between the particles A is attractive. In such\na case one encounters much more complex phase diagrams and also much richer critical behaviour. For\nbetter orientation, we have divided our discussion into several parts dealing with some typical cases.\n\u03b5AB > 0. In this case, the repulsive interaction between the A-B pairs favours the phase separation\ninto A-rich and B-rich phases and as a consequence of this, one finds a quite similar phase diagram and\ncoexistence curves as discussed in above (compare Fig. 2b with 2a). The most significant difference consists\nin an appearance of a special critical end point with coordinates [kB Tc\u2217 /|\u03b5AA |, p\u2217c /|\u03b5AA |] = [0.910, 0.051],\n\n3.2.1\n\n\fOctober 15, 2018\n6\n\n1:41\n\nMolecular Physics\n\nstrecka\nJ. Stre\u010dka et al.\n\nwhich is labelled by a star symbol in Figs. 2b)-d). While for pressures greater than p\u2217c the critical temperature monotonically increases as pressure rises, below the pressure p\u2217c there is a coexistence but no\ncriticality. This observation would suggest that the critical end point terminates at a liquid-vapour coexistence line of the pure A component. Actually, the mixture becomes pure A before it turns critical for any\npressure lower than p\u2217c . This fact can be clearly seen also from Fig. 3b, where the critical concentration\nis plotted against the critical temperature and all lines start from the same critical temperature of the\nc = 1). For illustration, we depict in Fig. 4b three typical coexistence curves that\npure A component (XA\nobviously exhibit much more pronounced asymmetry than those discussed formerly for the case with the\nrepulsive interaction \u03b5AA . Apparently, this asymmetry is the more evident, the lower and the closer is\npressure selected to its critical value p\u2217c , since the initially B-rich phase looses at low pressures much more\nrapidly its B component than the A-rich phase is enriched by the particles B.\n3.2.2\n\u22120.5 < \u03b5AB /|\u03b5AA | < 0. Contrary to the aforedescribed behaviour, it is easy to understand from\nFig. 2c that a weak attractive force between the A-B pairs leads to a monotonous decrease of the critical\ntemperature when increasing the pressure strength. The standard bell-shaped coexistence curves, which\nare plotted in Fig. 4c for one particular ratio \u03b5AB /|\u03b5AA | = \u22120.3 and several values of pressure, provide\na strong support for this statement. According to these plots and also dependences drawn in Fig. 3c, a\nc in response to a pressure strengthening is observed due to a\nsuppression of the critical concentration XA\nchange of the character of the interaction energy \u03b5AB . This rather easily understandable behaviour survives\nunless the ratio between both coupling constants does not reach the value \u03b5AB /|\u03b5AA | = \u22120.431. Within\nthe interval \u22120.5 < \u03b5AB /|\u03b5AA | < \u22120.431, however, an outstanding non-monotonous dependence of the\ncritical temperature on pressure can be detected. Assuming for instance that \u03b5AB /|\u03b5AA | = \u22120.45 is kept\nconstant, the Tc \u2212 pc dependence can be characterized by one local minimum [kB Tcmin /|\u03b5AA |, pmin\nc /|\u03b5AA |] =\n[0.146, 1.436] and one local maximum [kB Tcmax /|\u03b5AA |, pmax\n/|\u03b5\n|]\n=\n[0.353,\n1.643].\nWhile\nbelow\npmin\nor\nAA\nc\nc\nmax\nthe usual bell-shaped coexistence curves with single TU should be expected, the coexistence\nabove pc\ncurves with three consecutive critical points (TU , TL , and TU ) and reentrant miscibility should emerge\nfor any pressure from inside the interval bounded by pmin\nand pmax\n. Fig. 4d illustrates such example of a\nc\nc\nclosed loop above a bell-shaped coexistence curve with in total three critical points obtained at pressure\np/|\u03b5AA | = 1.5, as well as, the usual bell-shaped coexistence curve to emerge when p/|\u03b5AA | = 0.5. If pressure\nis selected sufficiently close but still below pmin\nc , the 'hour-glass' coexistence curve can be even detected;\ntemperature induces after initial increase of mutual solubility its decrement until a repeated increase of\nsolubility near TU re-appears, as it is clearly depicted for the particular case p/|\u03b5AA | = 1.0. It is worthwhile\nto remark that the aforementioned behaviour is completely consistent with experimental observations of\nthe pressure effect on the coexistence curves of the aqueous solution of 2-butanol (13; 14; 15).\nEven more involved situation emerges if pressure is selected directly equal to pmin\nor pmax\n. When the\nc\nc\nmax\nupper bound pc\nis selected, then TU and TL incident to an island of immiscibility coalesce at so-called\ndouble critical points which are shown as circles. On the other hand, the low-temperature TU of bellshaped curve merges together with TL of the closed loop to yield a critical double point (which is marked\nas diamond) by selecting the lower bound pmin\nfor pressure. Notice that the double critical points as well as\nc\nthe critical double point can be characterized by a doubling of the critical exponents as it has been proved\npreviously (37). However, the most peculiar critical point [kB Tcip /|\u03b5AA |, pip\nc /|\u03b5AA |] = [0.265, 1.862] appears\nby considering following value for the ratio between both coupling constants \u03b5AB /|\u03b5AA | = \u22120.431. In this\ncase all three critical temperatures coalesce simultaneously at so-called critical inflection point, which can\nbe characterized by a tripling of the critical exponents (37).\n\n3.2.3\n\n\u03b5AA < 0, \u03b5AB /|\u03b5AA | < \u22120.5. Finally, we shall discuss the coexistence phenomenon for the case\n\nwhen the attractive force between the A-B pairs is stronger than a half of the attractive force between\nthe A-A pairs, which means, \u03b5AB /|\u03b5AA | < \u22120.5. Under these circumstances, the coexistence region can\nbe located below the curves displayed in Fig. 2d. It is quite obvious from this figure that there appears a\nclosed loop of immiscibility whenever pressure is selected above p\u2217c but below the value pmax\ncorresponding\nc\nto the double critical point. Namely, the miscibility gap \u2206 = TU \u2212 TL gradually decreases upon pressure\n\n\fOctober 15, 2018\n\n1:41\n\nMolecular Physics\n\nstrecka\nREFERENCES\n\n7\n\nstrengthening until it vanishes at the double critical points where TU and TL merge together. This scenario\ncan be clearly seen from Fig. 4e, where the closed-loop coexistence curves are plotted for three different\npressures and the ratio \u03b5AB /|\u03b5AA | = \u22121. It is quite apparent from this figure that the stronger the\npressure, the smaller the miscibility gap (coexistence region). Note furthermore that there even exists\nanother possible scenario to have a coexistence without criticality at TU when selecting pressure below\np\u2217c /|\u03b5AA | = 0.051. In such a case, the temperature induces a phase separation at TL , nevertheless, both\nseparated phases become pure A before the mixture turns critical and hence, one observes two pure phases\nof particles A in coexistence that merely differ in their densities. This observation can be interpreted as\na liquid-vapour phase separation of the pure A component, which takes place because the component B\nvapourises prior to achieving the critical temperature when pressure is selected below its critical value p\u2217c .\n4\n\nConclusion\n\nThe present article deals with the investigation of phase separation in an asymmetric binary liquid mixture\nof large hexagonal and small triangular particles described by means of the generalized LTM on the\nhexagonal lattice. Despite its simplicity and a certain oversimplification, this model is relevant as it provides\ndeeper understanding of the phase separation phenomenon without making any further approximation to\nthe results obtained. In addition, this model proves an existence of the closed loops of immiscibility\noccurring under certain conditions either separately, or above the standard bell-shaped coexistence curves.\nThe closed-loop coexistence curve bounded by two critical points TU and TL indicates such a kind of\nthe reentrant miscibility, where TL determines an upper critical temperature under which two components\nbecome repeatedly perfectly miscible. On the other hand, the reentrant miscibility can also be found in the\nclosed loop plus bell-shaped coexistence curve with in total three critical points; the region of reentrant\nmiscibility then occurs in between TL of the closed loop and TU of the bell-shaped coexistence curve.\nAltogether, six possible scenarios for the phase separation were illustrated with the help of exact results\nfor the phase diagrams and coexistence curves: the standard bell-shaped curve with TU , the bell-shaped\ncurve without TU , the bell-shaped curve plus closed loop with two TU and one TL , the closed-loop curve\nwith TU and TL , the 'hour-glass' curve with TU , and the closed loop with TL but without TU .\nThe main objective of the present work was to provide an eventual confirmation of the aforementioned\ncoexistence scenarios, which were originally envisaged by Romero-Enrique and co-workers after introducing\nand exploring the generalized LTM (36). It should be pointed out, however, that the majority of numerical\nresults reported on hitherto were mostly restricted to the particular case of the generalized LTM on the\nsquare lattice. From this point of view, the investigation of LTM on the hexagonal lattice is of a particular\nimportance, because this model even has more obvious relevance to the phase separation of real binary\nliquid mixtures which might consist of molecules with a hexagonal symmetry (like benzene, cyclohexane\nand a large number of their structural and heterocyclic derivatives) and smaller non-linear molecules of\nthe solvent (like acetone, isopropanol, ethyleneoxide, ethers, dimethylsulfoxide, etc.). Our next effort is to\nprovide a further extension to the model under consideration to account also for multiparticle interactions\nand to elucidate a role of the size of solvent on the mutual solubility.\nReferences\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n\nC.S.
