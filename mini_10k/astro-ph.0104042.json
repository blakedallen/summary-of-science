First, large IR surveys are\nan entirely new resource, due to the advent of\nlarge format detectors, dedicated survey telescopes, and significant human and material resources. Second, the availability and uniform\nanalysis of large optical and IR surveys has led\nto a consensus on the shape of the global galaxy\nLF at both optical and IR wavelengths. Although\ncontroversy persisted for many years regarding\ndifferences between the optical LFs obtained by\ndifferent investigators (e.g., Loveday et al. 1992;\nEfstathiou et al. 1988; Marzke et al. 1994b; Lin\net al. 1996; Zucca et al. 1997; Ratcliffe et al.\n1998), these differences have now largely been resolved (Blanton et al. 2000). At IR wavelengths,\nagreement among different samples has been extraordinarily good (Mobasher et al. 1993; Glazebrook et al. 1995; Gardner et al. 1997; Szokoly\net al. 1998; Loveday 2000; Kochanek et al. 2000b;\nCole et al. 2000b). This long-awaited concordance\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe shape of the stellar mass function (SMF)\nis a fundamental property of the galaxy population because it constrains the baryon content of\ngalaxies, the fraction of all baryons in stars, and\nthe chemical evolution of galaxies. Until recently,\nhowever, observational work has been unable to\nprovide a reliable, direct estimate of the SMF.\nThis failure arises primarily because the conversion of the luminosity function (LF) into the SMF\nrequires the poorly-constrained optical mass-tolight (M/L) ratio, which in turn depends sensitively on both the stellar populations and the\nspatial distribution of dust and stars, neither of\nwhich is known for a substantial sample of galaxies. Complex models of dust and star formation\nare therefore required to compare the observations\nwith theoretical predictions (Cole et al. 2000a;\nGranato et al. 2000).\nIt is now possible to mitigate these difficulties\nby combining spectroscopic catalogs with large\ninfrared (IR) surveys. The sensitivity of M/L\nto stellar populations and extinction, which has\nplagued the transformation of the optical LF to a\nSMF, is lessened at IR wavelengths. M/L varies\nby only a factor of \u223c two over a large range of\nstar formation histories (e.g., Gavazzi, Pierini &\n\n1 This publication makes use of data products form the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), which is a joint project of the University of\nMassachusetts and the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center/California Institute of Technology, funded by the National Aeronautics and\nSpace Administration and the National Science Foundation.\n2 email:M.L.Balogh@durham.ac.uk\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nmakes it possible to confidently proceed and investigate variations in the LF for different galaxy\ntypes, different environments, and different redshifts. Third, the availability of large, cosmological simulations allow the dependence of the SMF\non environment to be modeled with some reliability. However, the translation from the dark matter halo mass function to the SMF still depends on\nsuch complicated and ill-understood factors as the\nbias function (White et al. 1987; Narayanan et al.\n2000), the gas cooling rate (Rees and Ostriker\n1977), and reheating due to feedback from star\nformation (e.g., Larson 1974; Cole 1991; Balogh\net al. 2001).\nA dependence of the SMF on galaxy type would\nnot be surprising, due to the distinctly different\nstar formation histories of late- and early-type\ngalaxies. In addition, we can expect an environmental dependence of the SMF because (1) the\nmerging history (e.g., Lacey and Cole 1993) and\nbias level (Bardeen et al. 1986; Narayanan et al.\n2000) of halos in clusters are different from those\nof isolated halos, (2) there are physical processes,\nsuch as galaxy harassment (Moore et al. 1999),\nthat may operate in dense cluster environments\nand alter the halo mass function, and (3) the\nstellar populations of cluster galaxies are different from those of field galaxies, perhaps indicative\nof different star formation histories (e.g., Dressler\net al. 1985; Balogh et al. 1997; Balogh et al.\n1998; Poggianti et al. 1999; Moss and Whittle\n2000).\nSuch expectations have already received some\nsupport from observations. It is well known that\nthe optical LF depends on galaxy morphology\n(e.g., Loveday et al. 1992; Binggeli et al. 1988;\nMarzke et al. 1994a; Marzke et al. 1998), primarily in the sense that it steepens toward later\ngalaxy types. Analogous trends are also seen if\nthe population is divided by emission line strength\n(Ellis et al. 1996; Lin et al. 1996; Loveday\net al. 1999; Christlein 2000), color (Marzke and\nda Costa 1997; Lin et al. 1996; Treyer et al.\n1998), or principal spectral components (Bromley et al. 1998; Folkes et al. 1999). In addition\nto the dependence on type, optical observations\nalso indicate that the dwarf-to-giant ratio steadily\nincreases with increasing environmental density\n(Sandage et al. 1985; de Propris et al. 1995; Ferguson and Sandage 1991; Bromley et al. 1998;\nZabludoff and Mulchaey 2000; Christlein 2000).\nThe trends seen in the optical LFs must be explored in the IR to determine whether they reflect\nunderlying variations in the SMF or in M/L. In\n\none recent example of such work, Kochanek et\nal. (2000b) find that the Ks \u2212band LF of galaxies\nhas the same dependence on morphology as seen\nat optical wavelengths. This finding is strong evidence that the galactic SMF is not universal, and\nthat early-type galaxies cannot simply be an unbiased subsample of late-type galaxies in which\nstar formation has ceased. Our primary purpose\nis to further explore in the IR the trends found in\nthe optical. The compilation of the data we use\nis described in \u00a72. In \u00a73, we calculate the J and\nKs band galaxy luminosity functions as a function of environment and spectral type. We find\nthat the trends in optical data are also present in\nthe IR data, and more significantly in the stellar\nmass function. The implications are explored in\n\u00a74, and we summarize our conclusions in \u00a75.\n2. DATA\n\nTo construct infrared luminosity functions, we\nuse photometry from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS; Jarrett et al. 2000), and redshifts\nfrom the Las Campanas Redshift Survey (LCRS;\nShectman et al. 1996). The LCRS consists of over\n25,000 galaxies with redshifts, approximately covering the magnitude range Rc = 15 to Rc = 17.7,\nwhere Rc is the \"hybrid\" Kron-Cousins R system\ndescribed in Lin et al. (1996). The survey includes some fields observed with a 50 fiber configuration, and other, later fields observed with a 112\nfiber configuration. The 50 fiber data are problematic because the sampling fraction is lower\nand the apparent magnitude range of the targeted galaxies is typically less than 1.5 magnitudes. Galaxies with high central surface brightnesses are excluded from the redshift survey, and\nthis limit is about 0.7 mag fainter in the 50 fiber\ndata. To ensure a homogeneous and maximally\ncomplete sample, we restrict ourselves to the 112\nfiber data, as did Lin et al. (1996) for their fiducial\ncomputation of the optical LF.\nWe use the second incremental data release of\nthe 2MASS catalog, which contains photometry\nin J, H and Ks bands of both extended and point\nsources. The overlap of this release and the 112fiber LCRS fields is patchy, covering only about\n40% of the LCRS. Cross-correlation between the\ncatalogs is done by matching galaxy astrometric positions. Following the example of Cole et\nal. (2000b), we allow matches between galaxies\nwhose positions differ by less than 0.75 times the\nJ-band Kron radius, to allow for the greater positional uncertainty of larger galaxies.\n\n\f3\n2.1. Spectral Classification\n\nZabludoff et al. (1996) measured the rest frame\nequivalent width of the [OII]\u03bb3727\u00c5 emission line,\nW\u25e6 (OII), and the strength of the Balmer break,\nD4000 . We use W\u25e6 (OII) to divide the sample into\nbroad spectral classes: emission line (EL) galaxies\nwith W\u25e6 (OII)\u2265 5 \u00c5 and non-emission line (NEL)\ngalaxies with W\u25e6 (OII)< 5\u00c5. Two caveats accompany this division. First, the [OII] line correlates\nwith H\u03b1 emission, albeit with considerable scatter, suggesting that it is a good indicator of star\nformation in an average sense (e.g., Kennicutt\n1992). However, W\u25e6 (OII) also depends on metallicity and ionization, and on extinction if dust is\nnon-uniformly distributed (i.e., more prevalent in\nHII regions; Charlot and Longhetti 2001). All of\nthese properties are expected to depend on galaxy\nluminosity. The correlation between [OII] and H\u03b1\ndoes indeed have a luminosity dependence (Tresse\net al. 1999; Jansen et al. 2001). Second, although, the fibers used in the LCRS are quite\nlarge (3.\u2032\u2032 5), Kochanek (2000a) suggests that aperture effects may still be important. We address\nthis issue in \u00a73.1.\n2.2. Environment Classification\n\nGroup and cluster catalogs have been generated by Christlein (2000) from the LCRS using a\nfriends-of-friends algorithm to search for overdensities in redshift space. For each association, the\none dimensional velocity dispersion, \u03c31 , is computed. We define galaxy clusters to be those with\n\u03c31 > 400 km/s, corresponding to a virial temperature of about 1 keV. Associations with smaller\n\u03c31 are termed \"groups\" and any galaxy not found\nto be in an overdense region is assigned to the\n\"field\" sample. Only associations with at least\nthree members are retained in the final catalog;\nwe discuss the possibility of biases related to this\neffect both below and in \u00a72.4.\nVelocity dispersions computed from small samples are biased low due to insufficient sampling\nof the wings of the distribution and the poor, biased determination of the mean (Zabludoff and\nMulchaey 1998). This bias results in some fraction of the associations that properly belong in\nthe \"cluster\" sample being incorrectly placed into\nthe \"group\" sample. Furthermore, identification\nof groups with low velocity dispersions is sensitive\nto the linking length used in the cluster-finding\nalgorithm, and such groups are more likely to be\ncontaminated by interlopers. This contamination\nresults in some groups that are false detections,\n\nand the galaxies in those \"groups\" should be properly identified as isolated galaxies. To the degree\nthat the environments are misclassified, any underlying differences among environments will be\ndiluted.\n2.3. Completeness\n\nWe compute the luminosity functions in both\nthe Ks band, which is commonly used, and the\nJ band, where the 2MASS photometry is deepest. In J, we use the Kron aperture magnitudes\nas the best estimate of the total magnitude. Cole\net al. (2000b) demonstrate that the most robust\nKs magnitudes are obtained by combining the\nKron J-magnitudes with the default J \u2212 Ks colors. This nonintuitive result arises because the\nJ images have a higher signal-to-noise ratio and\nallow a more accurate determination of the Kron\naperture size. We adopt this magnitude definition\nof Ks . A small fraction (2.2%) of the galaxies in\nthe LCRS within our magnitude range (defined\nbelow) are misclassified as stars in 2MASS. For\nthese galaxies, we use the 8\u2032\u2032 aperture magnitudes\nin the point source catalog.\nIt is important to check the overall completeness of the matched LCRS-2MASS catalog used\nin our analysis. In Figure 1 we show the fraction\nof the galaxies in 2MASS for which a successful\nmatch is made with a galaxy in the LCRS. We\nrestrict our comparison to the largest (20\u25e6 \u00d7 1.5\u25e6 )\ncontiguous patch covered by both surveys, which\nincludes about 1300 galaxies. The LCRS is not\nintended to be complete, but is a random sample\nof a magnitude-limited survey. The dashed line\nshows the effect of applying the weights necessary\nto correct for this incompleteness. At Ks > 12.2\nand J > 13.2, the corrected completeness is close\nto 100%. At brighter magnitudes, the completeness drops, due primarily to the LCRS's upper\nmagnitude cutoff (R \u223c 15); we therefore limit\nthe sample to magnitudes fainter than this limit.\nCole et al. (2000b) show that 2MASS is highly\ncomplete and is not missing a substantial number\nof low surface brightness galaxies. By association\nthere can be no significant incompleteness in low\nsurface brightness galaxies in the matched LCRS2MASS catalog, at least to the relatively bright\nlower magnitude limit of 2MASS.\nThe 2MASS catalog is complete to Ks = 13.2,\nand J = 14.5, as shown by Cole et al. (2000b). Up\nto about 0.5 mag fainter than these limits, the incompleteness is primarily due to misclassification\nof faint galaxies as stars and small biases in the\nmagnitude measurements. We mitigate some of\n\n\f4\n\nFig. 1.- The completeness of the LCRS, relative to 2MASS, as a function of J and Ks magnitudes. The solid line shows the fraction\nof galaxies in the 2MASS catalog that have a corresponding match in the LCRS spectroscopic catalog. The dotted line shows the result of\nweighting the LCRS counts to account for the sampling fraction. The incompleteness at the bright end is due to the bright magnitude cutoff\nof the LCRS.\n\nthis incompleteness by using the LCRS to identify galaxies that 2MASS has classified as stars.\nFurthermore, because our sample is considerably\nsmaller than that of Cole et al. , we are less concerned with systematic biasses of order <\n\u223c 0.1 mag,\nand we can maximize our useful sample size by\nconsidering fainter magnitude limits.\nOne other way to test the completeness of\nour sample is by considering the distribution of\nV /Vmax . For a galaxy at redshift z, V (z) is the\nvolume between it and the lowest redshift zmin at\nwhich it would still have been selected in the sample (due to the bright magnitude limit). Vmax is\nthe volume between zmin and zmax , where zmax is\nthe redshift at which the galaxy would drop out of\nthe sample due to the faint magnitude limit. For\na uniform spatial distribution of objects the mean\nvalue of V /Vmax is 0.5. Although galaxies are\nclustered, we expect that over the large volume\nsurveyed here the distribution can be thought of\nas uniform. In Figure 2 we show the distribution of V /Vmax for the Ks band sample, limited\nat Ks = 13.7, and the J band sample, limited\nat J = 15.0. With these limits, the distribution of V /Vmax is approximately uniform, though\nthere is a systematic variation of about 15%. The\nmean value of V /Vmax is about 3\u03c3 larger than the\nvalue of 0.5, which it would be for a statistically\ncomplete sampling of a spatially uniform population. This appears to be partly due to a deficit\n\nof galaxies with V /Vmax < 0.3, perhaps a consequence of Malmquist bias becoming important at\nKs > 13.5. Indeed, moving the magnitude limit\nbrighter by 0.2 mag does make the distribution\nof V /Vmax more uniform. None of the trends we\ndiscuss in this paper are affected by decreasing\nthe magnitude limit, although the uncertainties\nare increased and, consequently, the significance\nof the results is diminished. To maximize the useful sample size, we therefore restrict the Ks sample to 12.2 < Ks < 13.7, which consists of 2673\ngalaxies (including 274 cluster galaxies and 954\ngroup galaxies). In J, we consider the sample of\n3408 galaxies with 13.2 < J < 15.0 (including 346\ncluster galaxies and 1202 group galaxies).\n2.4. Potential Biases and Systematic Uncertainties\n\nClusters and groups (associations) are defined\nby identifying friends-of-friends in redshift space.\nOnly associations with three or more members\nare retained in the final catalog. A concern is\nthat near this cutoff, associations with steeper\nfaint end slopes \u03b1, or brighter characteristic magnitudes, might be preferentially included in the\ncatalog because more member galaxies would be\nabove the magnitude limit. This could bias the\nfinal LF; however, we expect the overall effect to\nbe small because the majority of the associations\nin our catalogue have more than the minimum\nthree members, and are unlikely to drop below\n\n\f5\n\nFig. 2.- The distribution of V /Vmax , for the Ks band sample (solid line), limited at Ks = 13.7, and the J band sample (dashed line)\nlimited at J = 15.0. The mean value is 0.521\u00b10.006 for the Ks sample and 0.513 \u00b10.005 for the J sample.\n\nthis threshold given reasonable variations in the\nLF. To test for this potential effect, we have constructed mock catalogs, as described in Christlein\n(2000), by adding \u223c350,000 artificial associations\nto the LCRS catalog. In one catalog, the associations have LFs with steep faint end slopes\nof \u03b1 = \u22121.2, and in another they have shallow\nslopes, \u03b1 = \u22120.6. As expected, we find no evidence from this experiment that the recovery fraction of associations with steeper faint-end slopes\nis higher than for those with flatter slopes. Thus,\nthis potential bias does not have a significant effect on our selection, even when considering mock\nsamples containing many more galaxies than the\nactual data.\nThere is a potential bias in any redshift catalog to be more complete in emission line galaxies\nbecause it is easier to measure redshifts for these\ngalaxies than for non-emission line galaxies. This\nbias is particularly acute for the faintest galaxies in the sample. The magnitude ranges of the\nLCRS and 2MASS are not well matched, so only\nthe brightest galaxies in the LCRS are included\nin our sample. In particular, most of the galaxies\nhave 15 < Rc < 16.5, well above the completeness\nlimit of the LCRS. Because the magnitude range\nis small, and because we are far from the magnitude limit of the LCRS, there is little danger\nthat a weak magnitude-dependent completeness\nfunction of the NEL galaxies has much effect on\nour analysis. In Figure 3 we show the V /Vmax\n\ndistributions for the NEL and EL galaxies in the\nKs selected sample. For the emission line galaxies, hV /Vmax i = 0.515 \u00b1 0.008, while for the NEL\ngalaxies hV /Vmax i = 0.525 \u00b1 0.008. There is no\nevidence that the completeness of the EL sample\ndiffers from that of the NEL sample.\n3. RESULTS\n\nWe compute the luminosity functions using\nboth the non-parametric method of Efstathiou,\nEllis & Peterson (1988, EEP) and by assuming\na Schechter (1976) function shape as described\nby Sandage, Tamman & Yahil (1979, STY). Luminosities are calculated assuming an \u03a9 = 1,\n\u039b = 0 cosmology, with the Hubble constant\nparametrized as H\u25e6 = 100h km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 .\nWhere not explicitly shown, we use h = 1. Kcorrections are taken from Poggianti (1997); they\nare small (less than 0.1 mag at z = 0.1) and nearly\nindependent of galaxy type. We neglect evolutionary corrections and extinction effects, both of\nwhich affect the magnitudes at less than the 0.1\nmag level (e.g., Cole et al. 2000b).\nWe do not compute volume densities to normalize the luminosity functions. An estimate of\nthe global normalization has already been presented in Cole et al. (2000b). For the field galaxies\nand the total sample, we normalize the luminosity functions to the weighted number of galaxies\nbrighter than MKs = \u221221.5 and MJ = \u221220.5. For\nthe group and cluster environments, we divide by\n\n\f6\n\nFig. 3.- For the Ks selected sample, the distribution of V /Vmax for emission line galaxies (solid line) and NEL galaxies (dashed line).\nThe mean value is 0.515\u00b10.008 for the emission line galaxies and 0.525\u00b10.008 for the NEL galaxies.\n\nthe number of associations to obtain the number\nof galaxies per group or cluster that are brighter\nthan this limit.\nIn Figure 4 we show the J and Ks -band luminosity functions for the full sample. Both\nare well fit by Schechter functions with parameters MK\u2217 s = \u221223.48 + 5logh, \u03b1Ks = \u22121.10, and\nMJ\u2217 = \u221222.23 + 5logh, \u03b1J = \u22120.96. In the nonparametric method, the uncertainties are determined from the information matrix (EEP). The\nuncertainties in the Schechter parameters are determined from contours of the likelihood function,\nand are shown as 67% confidence elliptical contours in Figure 5. In Figure 5, we compare our\nresult with recent measurements by Kochanek et\nal. (2000b) and Cole et al. (2000b). As shown in\nCole et al. , the small difference between their result and that of Kochanek et al. is mostly due\nto the difference in the magnitude definition (we\nuse that of Cole et al. ). For the Ks sample, we\nare in good agreement with Cole et al. For the\nJ sample, the 1\u03c3 contours do not overlap, which\nmay reflect the incompleteness introduced by including galaxies 0.5 magnitudes fainter than the\nnominal 2MASS completeness limit. We recover\nthe Cole et al. result if we impose the same magnitude limits. While statistically significant, the\ndifference in the J band results is small, and does\nnot affect our conclusions based on subdividing\nthe sample according to spectral type and environment.\n\n3.1. Dependence on Spectral Type\n\nIn Figure 6 we present the LFs divided by spectral type. In J and Ks the NEL galaxies have\na significantly flatter faint-end slope than the EL\ngalaxies; this result is also evident from the error\nellipses in Figure 5.\nKochanek (2000a) has recently suggested that\nthe fixed angular size of the fibers used to obtain the spectra leads to a substantial aperture\nrelated bias. To address the significance of this\neffect we show the fraction of NEL galaxies as a\nfunction of redshift, fNEL (z), in four bins of absolute magnitude (Figure 7). There is a weak trend,\nin the expected sense that more distant galaxies\nare more likely to have spectra with emission lines\nbecause the fixed aperture includes more of the\ngalaxy (we have already shown, in \u00a72.4, that this\nis not due to a redshift dependent incompleteness\nin NEL galaxies). Although low luminosity galaxies tend to be physically smaller than high luminosity galaxies, they also lie at preferentially lower\nredshifts in a magnitude-limited sample. Thus,\nwe expect the two effects to partially cancel out\nand reduce the size of this bias.\n3.2. Environmental Dependence\n\nAs described in \u00a72, we divide our sample into\nthree environmental categories, corresponding to\nfield, groups, and clusters. In Figure 8 we show\nthe luminosity functions of these three classes of\ngalaxies, compared with the best fit Schechter\n\n\f7\n\nFig. 4.- The J (open symbols) and Ks -band (filled symbols) luminosity functions. The points and solid lines are the determinations from\nthe EEP and STY methods, respectively. The luminosity functions are arbitrarily normalized to the weighted number of galaxies brighter\nthan MKs = \u221221.5 and MJ = \u221220.5 (the J-band LF is arbitrarily shifted vertically for clarity).\n\nFig. 5.- The error ellipses (67% confidence contours) on the Schechter parameters of the luminosity functions, for the full sample (filled\ncircle), EL galaxies (square) and NEL galaxies (cross). Recent determinations by Kochanek et al. (2000) and Cole et al. (2000b) are marked\nK00 and C00 respectively. The small difference between the C00 and K00 results are due to the different magnitude systems used. All\nparameters are for \u03a9 = 1, \u039b = 0, and include only k\u2212corrections, with no evolution.\n\n\f8\n\nFig. 6.- The J and Ks -band luminosity functions divided by spectral type. Open squares represent emission line galaxies, while crosses\nrepresent non-emission line galaxies. The luminosity functions are arbitrarily normalized to the weighted number of galaxies brighter than\nMKs = \u221221.5 and MJ = \u221220.5.\n\nFig. 7.- The fraction of NEL galaxies as a function of redshift is shown in the for four luminosity bins: \u221225.5 < MKs < \u221224.5 (filled\ncircles); \u221224.5 < MKs < \u221223.5 (open circles); \u221223.5 < MKs < \u221222.5 (crosses); and \u221222.5 < MKs < \u221221.5 (triangles).\n\n\f9\n\nfunctions for the full sample; the 67% confidence\nerror ellipses on the Schechter parameters are\nshown in Figures 9 and 10. The Schechter parameters of the J\u2212band cluster LF are inconsistent with those of the field LF at the 95% confidence level, as determined from the likelihood\ncontours. The trend is more significant in the\nJ\u2212band due to the larger sample size as a consequence of the deeper photometry. The difference\nis in the sense that the cluster LF has a brighter\nMJ\u2217 and a steeper \u03b1J ; however, given the degeneracy between these parameters it is not clear precisely how the LF shape varies. If we restrict\nthe Schechter fit to a limited luminosity range\n(e.g., brighter than MJ = \u221220.5, or fainter than\nMJ = \u221223.5), the best-fit parameters change\nalong the major axis of the error ellipse. However, both the cluster and field parameters move\nin the same direction, and the difference between\nthem is approximately maintained. It appears,\ntherefore, that the environmental dependence of\nthe LF is not restricted to just the bright or faint\nend.\nThe differences among the LFs of different environments are larger when only the NEL galaxies\nare considered, as shown in Figure 9. In the field,\nthe LF of NEL galaxies is much flatter than that\nof the full sample, but in clusters the LFs of EL\nand NEL are statistically indistinguishable. We\ndiscuss this result further in \u00a74.3. The Schechter\nparameters of the J and Ks luminosity functions,\nfor each data subsample, are tabulated in Table\n1.\n4. DISCUSSION\n\n4.1. Comparison with Literature\n\nIt is encouraging that the global luminosity\nfunctions measured here, based on redshifts from\nthe LCRS, are in such good agreement with recent determinations by Cole et al. (2000b) and\nKochanek et al. (2000b). As shown by those authors, all infrared LFs derived from large samples\nare consistent (e.g., Mobasher et al. 1993; Glazebrook et al. 1995; Gardner et al. 1997; Szokoly\net al. 1998; Loveday 2000). This concordance is\nin contrast with the historical situation at optical wavelengths, where there has been considerable disagreement between results in the literature. In particular, optical LFs derived from the\nLCRS (Lin et al. 1996; Christlein 2000) are generally shallower than most other measurements,\nand it has recently been shown that this difference results from an underestimation of galaxy\nmagnitudes due to the shallow isophotal limit of\n\nthe LCRS photometry and from the exclusion of\nlow central surface brightness galaxies (Blanton et\nal. 2000). The fact that we do not find a shallow\nslope in the infrared LF supports the interpretation that, at least over the relatively narrow,\nbright magnitude range of 2MASS, it is the R\nmagnitudes, and not the survey selection itself,\nthat is responsible for the discrepancy in the optical.\nAnalysis of the optical LF dependence on environment was done by Christlein (2000), using\nthe LCRS sample. Although the LCRS magnitudes are systematically biased due to the bright\nisophotal limit, this bias applies uniformly to the\nwhole sample and is therefore unlikely to affect\nthe trends discussed in that paper. Christlein\nfound strong evolution of the LF with environment, with the Schechter parameters changing\nalong the major axis of the ellipse, toward steeper\n\u03b1 and brighter M \u2217 with larger \u03c3. The magnitude and sense of this change are fully consistent with the results presented in \u00a73.2. The fact\nthat Christlein finds such a continuous dependence on \u03c3 (something we are unable to investigate due to our smaller sample size) provides encouraging support that the effect is real. Zabludoff & Mulchaey (2000) found similar evidence for\nsteep, bright R-band LFs in X-ray selected groups\n(\u03b1 = \u22121.3). Because these groups generally have\nkT >\n\u223c 1 keV, many would be considered \"clusters\"\nby our criteria, and their results for steeper optical LFs in these systems are very similar to our\nresults for the cluster infrared LFs.\nPreviously published evidence for an environmental dependence of the infrared LF is not as\nstrong as for the optical LF. Both De Propris\net al. (1998) and Andreon & Pell\u00f3 (2000) find\na steep faint end slope in the H band LF of\nthe Coma cluster, but only at magnitudes fainter\nthan our sample probes. Trentham & Mobasher\n(1998) find no evidence for a difference between\nthe K-band LFs of cluster and field galaxies, over\n\u221224 < MK < \u221222, although the uncertainties are\nlarge. Our sample is the first that is large enough\nto detect this weak effect at these luminosities.\nWe look forward to dramatically improving the\nprecision of this result when the full 2MASS catalog is released.\n4.2. The Stellar Mass Function\n\nDo the observed dependencies of the infrared\nLF on environment and spectral type necessarily\nimply an analogous difference in the stellar mass\nfunctions? The infrared light is a good, but not\n\n\f10\n\nFig. 8.- The J and Ks -band luminosity functions as a function of environment, shown as the error bars (EEP method) and the solid\nlines (STY method). The luminosity functions are arbitrarily normalized to the weighted number of galaxies brighter than MKs = \u221221.5\nand MJ = \u221220.5, divided by the number of groups or clusters as appropriate in the lower two panels. The dashed lines show the (arbitrarily\nrenormalized) luminosity function for the whole sample for comparison. In most cases, this curve is hidden by the overlapping luminosity\nfunctions.\n\nFig. 9.- The 67% confidence error ellipses of the J-band Schechter fits for galaxies divided by environment. On the left are results for\ngalaxies in the field (top), group (middle) and cluster (bottom) samples.

On the right\nside of the figure, the samples are divided into EL and NEL galaxies.

To estimate M/L, constraints on the mean stellar age\nare required. The optical-IR colors of our sample\nare unreliable due to the shallow isophotal limit of\nthe LCRS, and the IR colors alone are insensitive\nto stellar population differences. The best indicator available to us is therefore the D4000 spectral\nindex from the LCRS spectra. We use the solarmetallicity models of Fioc & Rocca-Volmerange\n(1997) to generate spectra from a given star formation history. We then compute D4000 directly\nfrom the spectra, using the same definition as\nZabludoff et al. (1996). The correlation between\nM/LJ and D4000 depends only weakly on star formation history. Figure 11 shows model results\nfor a single burst, simple stellar population (SSP)\nand for a galaxy with a constant star formation\nrate, using a Kennicutt (1983) initial mass function. The two models can differ by as much as\n40%, over a narrow range of D4000 , but the ranking with M/L is unchanged. D4000 is sensitive to\nmetallicity and reddening, which we neglect, but\nis less sensitive than optical colors. For example,\nan extinction of AV = 1.5 magnitudes only reddens D4000 by about 0.2.\nIn Figure 12 we show the 67% and 95% error ellipses on the Schechter parameters for the stellar\nmass functions derived using the M/L corrections\nderived from the SSP model. The differences observed in the luminosity functions are exacerbated\nin the stellar mass functions. Thus, we conclude\nthat the stellar mass function is not universal, but\ndepends on both galaxy type and the local environment.\n4.3. Implications and Speculations\n\nBoth Christlein (2000) and Zabludoff &\nMulchaey (2000) find that the change in the optical LF shape with environment is due almost\nexclusively to the NEL galaxies. We confirm that\nthe difference in the infrared cluster LF, relative\nto the field, is dominated by this population. It\nis interesting that the faint end slope of the NEL\ngalaxies in clusters, as parametrized by \u03b1, is similar to that of the overall field faint end slope. One\ninterpretation for this similarity is that the bulk\nof the cluster population is built up by accreting\nfield galaxies with little effect other than the cessation of star formation, as modeled for example\nby Balogh, Navarro & Morris (2000). However,\nfrom only the agreement of the LFs, we cannot\n\nexclude scenarios in which the similar initial progentors of faint galaxies in various environments\nbegan forming stars at different times (the cluster\nones earlier by virtue of originating near a large\nmass perturbation). In the latter scenario, one\nexpects the field LF to evolve to the cluster LF\nin time, as gas is consumed by galaxies and their\nstar formation stops.\nIn Figure 13 we show the fraction of NEL galaxies as a function of luminosity for the global sample. This Figure shows a strong trend that, unfortunately, is difficult to interpret because metallicity and extinction also correlate with luminosity\nin a way that makes [OII] stronger in low luminosity galaxies (e.g., Jansen 2001). We cannot\ninfer the extent to which this relation indicates\nan inherent correlation between galaxy mass and\ninstantaneous star formation rate - a correlation\nthat would be an important test of galaxy formation models. In particular, a variation in the fraction of currently star forming galaxies with mass\ncould indicate that the dominant mode of star formation (i.e., burst-like or continuous) for a galaxy\nin the field is mass dependent (e.g., Kauffmann,\nCharlot & Balogh, in preparation).\n5. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have measured the J and Ks -band galaxy\nluminosity functions from the 2MASS, using redshifts from the LCRS, and divided the sample\nbased on spectral type and environment. We draw\nthe following conclusions:\n\u2022 In non-cluster environments, the infrared\nluminosity function of emission line (EL)\ngalaxies is steeper than that of non-emission\nline (NEL) galaxies.\n\u2022 There is a statistically significant difference\nbetween the cluster and field galaxy infrared\nluminosity functions, in the sense that M \u2217 is\nbrighter, and the faint end slope \u03b1 is steeper,\nin clusters.\n\u2022 Using the D4000 spectral index from the\nLCRS spectra to aid us in converting from\ninfrared luminosity to stellar mass, we conclude that the results just described also hold\nfor the stellar mass functions and, in fact, the\ndifferences are more pronounced.\n\u2022 The shape of the NEL galaxy stellar mass\nfunction in clusters is similar to that of the\nglobal stellar mass function in the field. One\nexplanation of this trend is that the cluster is\nmostly built up of field EL galaxies, in which\n\n\f13\n\nFig. 11.- Mass-to-light ratio in the J band, as a function of D4000 , for a Kennicutt (1983) initial mass function from the models of Fioc &\nRocca-Volmerange (1997).

The differences in luminosity function shape when divided by spectral type and environment are even\nmore pronounced in the stellar mass functions than in the luminosity functions.\n\n\f14\n\nFig. 13.- The fraction of non-emission line galaxies as a function of luminosity, as determined by the non-parametric luminosity function\n(points) and the Schechter function fits (solid line).\n\nstar formation has ceased either because (1)\nthe galaxies consumed all their gas (either\nthrough accelerated star formation due to\nthe cluster environment, or by forming earlier due to their proximity to a large mass\nperturbation); or (2) they lost some or all\ntheir gas through processes like ram pressure\nstripping.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe thank Guinevere Kauffmann for suggesting\nthe idea of comparing the 2MASS and LCRS catalogs.
