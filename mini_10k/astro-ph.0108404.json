This is one of the two deepest X-ray surveys ever conducted, the other being\nthe Chandra Deep Field South survey (e.g., Tozzi et al. 2001; P. Rosati et al., in preparation).\nNear the aim point, the CDF-N observation reaches 0.5\u20132.0 keV and 2\u20138 keV limiting fluxes of\n\u2248 3 \u00d7 10\u221217 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 and \u2248 2 \u00d7 10\u221216 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , respectively; these flux limits are \u2248 40\nand \u2248 400 times fainter than achieved by pre-Chandra missions. In Figure 1 we compare the\n0.5\u20132.0 keV flux limit and solid angle of this survey to those of several other extragalactic X-ray\nsurveys. This survey has both the sensitivity and positional accuracy needed to complement the\ndeepest surveys at other wavelengths, and much of the \u2248 450 arcmin2 area surveyed has extensive\nradio, submillimeter, infrared, and optical coverage (see Livio, Fall, & Madau 1998 and Ferguson\net al. 2000 for reviews).\nThe main goals of the CDF-N survey are (1) to understand the broad-band emission and nature\nof the sources producing the X-ray background in the 0.5\u20138.0 keV band, and (2) to investigate the\nX-ray emission properties of physically interesting sources identified at other wavelengths. Thus\nfar, we have presented results for the HDF-N (Hornschemeier et al. 2000, hereafter Paper I; Brandt\net al. 2001a, Paper IV) as well as for larger fields centered on the HDF-N (Hornschemeier et al.\n2001, Paper II; Garmire et al. 2001, Paper III; Barger et al. 2001). Due to the fact that the Chandra\nobservations were performed in an incremental manner from 1999 November to 2001 March, the\nstudies above were all performed with less than the full \u2248 1 Ms exposure.\nIn this paper, we provide source catalogs derived from the \u2248 1 Ms data set along with details of the observations, data reduction, and technical analysis. Our intention is to provide this\ninformation to the community in as timely a manner as possible. We have deliberately avoided\nfollow-up investigations and detailed scientific interpretation in this paper; these will be presented\nin subsequent papers (and many such results have been presented in the papers cited above). For\nexample, companion papers by Alexander et al. (2001, Paper VI), Brandt et al. (2001b, Paper VII), A.J. Barger et al., in preparation, and F.E. Bauer et al., in preparation present results on\noptically faint X-ray sources, X-ray emission from Lyman break galaxies, optical follow-up imaging\nand spectroscopy, and extended X-ray sources.\nIn \u00a72 we describe the observations and data reduction. In \u00a73 we describe the data analysis and\nresults, with emphasis on the detection of point sources (\u00a73.2) and extended sources (\u00a73.3). We\nalso present basic number count results for point sources in \u00a73.2. Our conclusions and summary\nare presented in \u00a74.\nThe Galactic column density along this line of sight is (1.6 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 (Stark et al.\n1992). H0 = 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9M = 1/3, and \u03a9\u039b = 2/3 are adopted throughout this paper.\nCoordinates throughout this paper are J2000. The HDF-N itself is centered at \u03b12000 = 12h 36m\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n49.s 4, \u03b42000 = +62\u25e6 12\u2032 58\u2032\u2032 , corresponding to l = 125.\u25e6 888, b = 54.\u25e6 828 (W96).\n\n2.\n\nObservations and Data Reduction\n2.1.\n\nInstrumentation\n\nAll observations of the CDF-N field were performed with the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS; G.P. Garmire et al., in preparation) on Chandra (Weisskopf et al. 2000).1 ACIS\nconsists of ten CCDs designed for efficient X-ray detection and spectroscopy. Four of the CCDs\n(ACIS-I; CCDs I0\u2013I3) are arranged in a 2 \u00d7 2 array with each CCD tipped slightly to approximate\nthe curved focal surface of the Chandra High Resolution Mirror Assembly (HRMA). The remaining six CCDs (ACIS-S; CCDs S0\u2013S5) are set in a linear array and are tipped to approximate the\nRowland circle of the objective gratings that can be inserted behind the HRMA. The CCD which\nlies on-axis in ACIS-I is I3, and the full ACIS-I field of view is 16.\u2032 9 \u00d7 16.\u2032 9.\nThe ACIS pixel size is \u2248 0.\u2032\u2032 492. The 95% encircled-energy radius for an energy of 1.5 keV\nat the aim point is \u2248 1.\u2032\u2032 8. This radius increases to \u2248 2.\u2032\u2032 7 when 4\u2032 from the aim point and \u2248 7.\u2032\u2032 5\nwhen 8\u2032 from the aim point (Feigelson, Broos, & Gaffney 2000; Jerius et al. 2000; M. Karovska\nand P. Zhao 2001, private communication).2 Note that at higher energies the aim-point PSF is\nsignificantly broader than at 1.5 keV.\n\n2.2.\n\nObservational Parameters and Conditions\n\nThe CDF-N was observed in twelve separate observations as detailed in Table 1. The total\nexposure time was 975.3 ks. The HDF-N was placed near the aim point of the ACIS-I array\nduring all observations, and care was taken to keep the HDF-N away from the gaps between the\nCCDs. The focal-plane temperature, which governs several characteristics of the CCD behavior, in\nparticular the Charge Transfer Inefficiency (CTI), was \u2212110\u25e6 C during the first three observations\nand \u2212120\u25e6 C during the others. When observing with ACIS-I, two CCDs from ACIS-S, typically S2\nand S3, can be operated. CCD S3 was turned off during the HDF-N observations due to the higher\nbackground level of this device; this property could cause telemetry saturation during background\nflares. CCD S2, however, was operated.\nThe region covered by the Chandra observations is considerably larger than 16.\u2032 9 \u00d7 16.\u2032 9 due to\nthe different observation pointings and roll angles (see Table 1).

The average aim point, weighted by exposure time, is \u03b12000 = 12h\n36m 48.s 1, \u03b42000 = +62\u25e6 13\u2032 53\u2032\u2032 . The aim points of the individual observations are separated from the\naverage aim point by 1.\u2032 6\u20133.\u2032 1; most are within 2.\u2032 1 of the average aim point. Due to the large off-axis\nangle of CCD S2 during these observations, it has low sensitivity. Therefore, we only include data\nfrom S2 when these data overlap part of the sky also covered by ACIS-I in other observations.\nBackground light curves have been inspected for all of the observations. All but one are free\nfrom strong flaring due to \"space weather\" and are stable to within \u2248 20%. The only observation\nwith substantial flaring is 2344; during \u2248 30 ks of this observation the background was \u2248 2 times\nhigher than nominal. However, the data quality during the flaring was still sufficiently high to\nprovide useful scientific information so these data were not excluded; the exclusion of these data\nwould have little impact on the analysis or results presented here.\n\n2.3.\n\nData Reduction\n\nThe versions of the Chandra X-ray Center (hereafter CXC) pipeline software used for basic\nprocessing of the data are listed in Table 1. In the reduction and analysis below, Chandra Interactive\nAnalysis of Observations (ciao) Version 2 tools were used whenever possible.3 Tools for ACIS Realtime Analysis (tara; Broos et al. 2000) and custom software were also used.4\nAll data were corrected for the radiation damage sustained by the CCDs during the first\nfew months of Chandra operations using the procedure of Townsley et al. (2000).5 This procedure\npartially corrects for the positionally dependent grade distribution due to inefficient charge transfer\nin the radiation-damaged CCDs. It also partially corrects for quantum efficiency losses, which are\nmost significant in data acquired at \u2212110\u25e6 C (see Townsley et al. 2000 and Paper II for discussion\nof the remaining small quantum efficiency losses incurred).\nWe have removed bad columns, bad pixels, and cosmic ray afterglows as flagged by the CXC\nusing the \"status\" information in the event files.6 We have only used data taken during times\nwithin the CXC-generated good-time intervals. The standard pixel randomization was removed as\npart of the aspect correction procedure described in \u00a73.1.7\n3\n\nSee http://asc.harvard.edu/ciao/.\n\n4\n\ntara is available at http://www.astro.psu.edu/xray/docs.\n\n5\n\nThe software associated with the correction method of Townsley et al.\nhttp://www.astro.psu.edu/users/townsley/cti/.\n6\n\n(2000) is available at\n\nCosmic ray afterglows occur in front-side illuminated ACIS CCDs when charge from an incident cosmic ray is\nreleased slowly, causing a series of spurious events in the same CCD pixel over several sequential frames. These events\ncan resemble a real cosmic X-ray source.

We have\nadopted 8 keV (rather than the often-used 10 keV) as the full-band, hard-band, and ultrahardband maximum energy because from 8\u201310 keV the effective area of the HRMA is steeply decreasing\nwith energy while the background is increasing.8 Inspection and searching of the data revealed no\nsignificant sources in the 8\u201310 keV band. We have employed the two grade sets defined in Table 2.\nAs described in Paper IV, the use of the \"restricted ACIS grade set\" in addition to the \"standard\nASCA grade set\" improves our ability to detect faint sources in some cases. All photometry below,\nhowever, is reported using the standard ASCA grade set.\nWe have registered the data sets following \u00a73.1 of Paper II. Briefly, we registered all the data\nsets to the coordinate frame of observation 966 using 11\u201317 bright X-ray sources detected in the\nindividual observations within \u2248 6\u2032 of the aim point; registration is accurate to within \u2248 0.\u2032\u2032 4.\nAbsolute X-ray source positions were obtained by matching 72 sources from the registered total\ndata set to 1.4 GHz radio sources detected by Richards (2000); these 1.4 GHz sources have accurate\n< 0.\u2032\u2032 3) positions, and the 1.4 GHz coverage encompasses the entire Chandra field. Comparison\n(\u223c\nwith these sources allowed us to remove shift, rotation, and plate-scale effects. Chandra positions\nused in the data set registration and absolute astrometry determination were found using the\nwavelet-based source detection algorithm wavdetect (Dobrzycki et al. 1999; Freeman et al.\n2001) following \u00a73.2.1.\nFigure 2 shows the accuracy of our astrometric solution by matching the full-band Chandra\nsources presented in \u00a73.2.1 with 1.4 GHz sources from Richards (2000). There are 241 1.4 GHz\nsources within the Chandra field. In the matching, we consider only the 74 Chandra sources\nthat match with 1.4 GHz sources to within 2.\u2032\u2032 5 (the 72 sources used to determine the absolute\nastrometry in the previous paragraph excluded the two outliers in Figure 2 with offsets > 1.\u2032\u2032 5).\nThe vast majority of these 74 matches are expected to be correct, but \u2248 2 are expected to be\nfalse matches. We also note that in some cases the X-ray source may be offset from the radio\nsource even though both are associated with the same galaxy (e.g., a galaxy with a radio-emitting\nnuclear starburst that also has an off-nuclear \"super-Eddington\" X-ray binary). Figure 2 shows\nthat the X-ray positions are usually good to within \u2248 0.\u2032\u2032 6 for off-axis angles < 5\u2032 . At larger off-axis\nangles, where the HRMA point spread function (PSF) rapidly broadens and becomes complex,\nthe positional accuracy, as expected, degrades. Most sources have positions good to within 1\u2032\u2032 ,\nbut positional offsets up to \u2248 1.\u2032\u2032 5\u20132.\u2032\u2032 0 are possible. We do not find any systematic errors in our\n8\n\nFor further information on the HRMA performance and Chandra background see Chapters 4 and 6 of the Chandra\nProposers' Observatory Guide at http://asc.harvard.edu/udocs/docs.

These images have been made using the standard ASCA grade set. The\nadaptively smoothed images have been corrected for spatial variations of the effective exposure time\nusing the exposure maps described below. The exposure maps were adaptively smoothed using the\nsame \"scale maps\" as for the images themselves, and we excluded regions where the adaptively\nsmoothed effective exposure time was less than 50 ks. The adaptively smoothed images were not\nused for source detection, but they do show many of the detected X-ray sources more clearly than\nthe raw images. Note that some of the sources discussed below are not visible in the adaptively\nsmoothed images; these sources fall below the significance level of the adaptive smoothing used to\nmake the images. In Figure 5 we show a color composite of the adaptively smoothed soft-band,\nhard-band and ultrahard-band images. Soft sources appear red, moderately hard sources appear\ngreen, and the hardest sources appear blue. In Figure 6 we show an adaptively smoothed full-band\nimage of the HDF-N itself and its immediate environs; this image will be discussed further in \u00a73.2.3.\nWe have made maps of effective exposure time, defined as the equivalent amount of exposure\ntime for a source located at the aim point, following the basic procedure described in \u00a73.2 of Paper II\n(see Figure 7). These \"exposure maps\" take into account the effects of vignetting, gaps between\nthe CCDs, bad column filtering, and bad pixel filtering. One exposure map has been created for\neach of the standard bands, and the maps were sampled every fourth pixel in both right ascension\nand declination. In creating these, we have assumed a typical power-law spectrum with a photon\nindex of \u0393 = 1.4 (this is the slope of the X-ray background in the Chandra band). In Figure 8 we\nshow a cumulative plot of the survey solid angle as a function of effective exposure in the full band.\n\n3.2.\n3.2.1.\n\nPoint-Source Detection and Results\nPoint-Source Detection and Parameterization\n\nPoint-source detection in each standard band was performed with wavdetect. wavdetect\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwas run using a \" 2 sequence\" of wavelet scales; scales of 1, 2, 2, 2 2, 4, 4 2, and 8 pixels were\nused. We found this choice of wavelet scales to give the best overall performance across the field,\nbut we will also discuss the results for larger wavelet scales in \u00a73.2.2. In the wavdetect source\ndetection the average aim point defined in \u00a72.2 was used when calculating off-axis angles. Our\nkey criterion for source detection is that a source must be found with a false-positive probability\nthreshold of 1 \u00d7 10\u22127 in at least one of the four standard bands using either the standard ASCA\nor restricted ACIS grade sets. We have not run wavdetect with a low false-positive probability\nthreshold and then performed ex post facto processing of the detected sources to attempt to separate\ntrue from spurious detections; such a process would be subjective and counter to the philosophy\nof wavdetect (Freeman et al. 2001; P.E. Freeman 2001, private communication). Our detection\ncriterion is fairly conservative; fainter but real sources are undoubtedly present in the field. However,\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nour work on the CDF-N data thus far shows that we have struck an appropriate balance between\nsensitivity and source reliability.\nConservatively treating the eight images searched as entirely independent, \u2248 5 false sources\nare expected statistically for the case of a uniform background. In reality, the background is far\nfrom uniform due to the large variation of effective exposure time across the field (see Figure 7). In\naddition, the background increases near bright point sources due to the PSF \"wings.\" It is difficult\nto quantify precisely the effects of a non-uniform background upon the performance of wavdetect.\nHowever, based upon the amount of area where background gradients are present and inspection of\nthe sources detected in this area, we would not expect the number of false sources to be increased\nby more than a factor of \u223c 2\u20133. Less than \u2248 4% of the sources discussed below should be false.\nExtensive analysis of the wavdetect source positions revealed that a significant fraction of the\n> 4\u2032 suffered from centroiding errors of 0.2\u20132\u2032\u2032 . These apparently arise as\nsources at off-axis angles \u223c\na result of both limitations in the wavdetect centroiding method as well as the fact that there is\nnot a single Chandra PSF applicable for any given source (due to the different observation pointings\nand roll angles described in \u00a72.2, the spatial profile of any given point source is the superposition\nof several Chandra PSFs).9 Testing and consultation with the CXC showed that the wavdetect\ncentroiding could be significantly improved by running wavdetect without information about\nthe Chandra PSF (P.E. Freeman and D.E. Harris 2001, private communication). Therefore, in as\nmany cases as possible, we have replaced the original wavdetect source positions with those from\nwavdetect runs made excluding PSF information; note that these \"no-PSF\" runs were only used\nfor positional replacement and not for source detection. Positional replacement was performed for\n86% of the detected sources; for the remaining sources it was not possible due to either a nondetection or a multiple detection in the the no-PSF run. The average positional improvement was\n\u2248 0.\u2032\u2032 3 but in some cases was as large as \u2248 1.\u2032\u2032 5 (as determined by matching with Richards 2000\nsources at 1.4 GHz).\nwavdetect was also used to search the standard-band images for lower-significance, crossband counterparts to the highly significant sources already detected at the 1 \u00d7 10\u22127 level in at least\none of the four bands; in these runs we used a false-positive probability threshold of 1 \u00d7 10\u22125 . We\nfound 110 cross-band counterparts in this manner. Since the spatial-matching requirement greatly\nreduces the number of pixels being searched, the statistically expected number of false cross-band\n< 0.5).\nmatches is small ( \u223c\nAll of the standard-band source lists created in the source detection described above were\nmerged to create the point-source catalog given as Table 3. For cross-band matching, a matching\nradius of \u2264 2.\u2032\u2032 5 was used for sources within 6\u2032 of the average aim point. For larger off-axis angles,\na matching radius of \u2264 4.\u2032\u2032 0 was used. These matching radii were chosen based on inspection of\nhistograms showing the number of matches obtained as a function of angular separation (see \u00a72 of\n9\n\nSome information on this issue is given as Case #4460 of the CXC Helpdesk at http://cxc.harvard.edu/helpdesk/.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nBoller et al. 1998); with these radii the mismatch probability is \u2248 1% over the entire field.\nManual correction of the wavdetect results was required in several cases. For example,\nwavdetect detections of the brightest components of highly extended sources were removed since\nthese sources will be discussed separately in \u00a73.3. In four cases, we have removed sources whose\ncentroids appear to lie outside the field of view; wavdetect had only detected the PSF wings of\nthese sources, and their positions and count rates are not well defined. Manual separation of a few\nclose doubles was required, and we have manually determined the position of each separated source.\nThese sources suffer larger photometric errors due to the difficulty of the separation process. It was\nalso necessary to perform manual photometry for two sources near the edge of the field of view and\na few faint sources located close to much brighter sources. We have flagged all sources requiring\nmanual correction in Column 16 of Table 3 (see below).\nBelow we explain the columns in Table 3.\n\u2022 Column 1 gives the source number. Sources are listed in order of right ascension.\n\u2022 Columns 2 and 3 give the right ascension and declination, respectively. These positions have\nbeen determined by wavdetect when possible. Whenever possible, we quote the position\ndetermined in the full band; when a source is not detected in the full band we use, in order of\npriority, the soft-band position, hard-band position, or ultrahard-band position. In addition,\nwe adopt a soft-band position from a no-PSF run over a full-band position when full-band\npositional replacement from a no-PSF run was not possible (see above). The priority ordering\nof position choices above was designed to generally maximize the signal-to-noise of the data\nbeing used for positional determination. To avoid truncation error, we quote the positions\nto higher precision than in the International Astronomical Union approved names beginning\nwith the acronym \"CXO HDFN.\"10\n\u2022 Column 4 gives the positional error. Sources within 5\u2032 of the average aim point have positional\nerrors of 0.\u2032\u2032 6. Sources farther than 5\u2032 from the average aim point have positional errors given\nby the empirically determined equation:\n\u2206 = 0.6 +\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b8 \u2212 5\u2032\n8.75\u2032\n\n\u0013\n\narcsec\n\n(for \u03b8 > 5\u2032 )\n\nwhere \u2206 is the positional error in arcsec and \u03b8 is the off-axis angle in arcmin (compare with\nFigure 2). The positional error does not appear to be a strong function of the number of source\ncounts (although a mild dependence is probably present); this is largely due to the relatively\nsharp core of the Chandra PSF. The stated positional errors are for \u2248 90% confidence, and\nthe accuracy of our astrometric solution is discussed in \u00a73.1.\n10\n\nSee http://cxc.harvard.edu/udocs/naming.html.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n\u2022 Columns 5\u20138 give the counts in the four standard bands; here and hereafter \"FB\" indicates full\nband, \"SB\" indicates soft band, \"HB\" indicates hard band, and \"UHB\" indicates ultrahard\nband. All values are for the standard ASCA grade set, and they have not been corrected for\nvignetting. Source counts and 1\u03c3 statistical errors (from Gehrels 1986) have been calculated\nusing circular aperture photometry; extensive testing showed this method to be more reliable\nthan the wavdetect photometry. The circular aperture was centered at the position given\nin columns 2 and 3 for all bands. A source-free local background has been subtracted, and\nunexposed regions were masked.\nFor sources with fewer than 1000 full-band counts, we have chosen the aperture radii based\non the encircled-energy function of the Chandra PSF as determined using the CXC's mkpsf\nsoftware (Feigelson et al. 2000; Jerius et al. 2000; M. Karovska and P. Zhao 2001, private\ncommunication). In the soft band where the image quality is the best, the aperture radius\nwas set to the 95% encircled-energy radius of the PSF, and in the other bands the 90%\nencircled-energy radius of the PSF was used. Appropriate aperture corrections were applied\nto the source counts.\nFor sources with more than 1000 full-band counts, systematic errors in the aperture corrections\noften exceed the expected errors from photon statistics when the apertures described in the\nprevious paragraph are used. Therefore, for such sources we used larger apertures to minimize\nthe importance of the aperture corrections; this is appropriate since these bright sources\ndominate over the background. We set the aperture radii to be twice those used in the\nprevious paragraph and manually inspected these sources to verify that the measurements\nwere not contaminated by neighboring objects.\nWe have performed several consistency checks to verify the quality of the photometry. For\nexample, we have checked that the sum of the counts measured in the soft and hard bands does\nnot differ from the counts measured in the full band by an amount larger than that expected\n< 4%.\nfrom measurement error. Systematic errors in our photometry are estimated to be \u223c\nPhotometry more accurate than this will require improved modeling of the Chandra PSF at\nlarge off-axis angles by the CXC (M. Karovska and P. Zhao 2001, private communication) as\nwell as detailed treatment of the fact that there is not a single Chandra PSF applicable for\nany given source (due to the different observation pointings and roll angles described in \u00a72.2).\nIn addition, it will probably be necessary to make the aperture corrections for each source\ndependent upon its spectral shape.\nWe have verified that the cosmic ray afterglow removal procedure (see \u00a72.3) has not led to\nsignificant systematic photometric errors. Due to the low count rates of our sources, incident\nX-ray photons are almost never incorrectly flagged as afterglow events.\nWhen a source is not detected in a given band, an upper limit is calculated. All upper\nlimits are determined using circular apertures as above. When the number of counts in the\naperture is \u2264 10, the upper limit is calculated using the Bayesian method of Kraft, Burrows,\n& Nousek (1991) for 95% confidence. The uniform prior used by these authors results in\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nfairly conservative upper limits (see Bickel 1992), and other reasonable choices of priors do\nnot materially change our scientific results. For larger numbers of counts in the aperture,\nupper limits are calculated at the 3\u03c3 level for Gaussian statistics.\n\u2022 Column 9 gives the band ratio, defined as the ratio of counts between the hard and soft bands.\nErrors for this quantity are calculated following the \"numerical method\" described in \u00a71.7.3 of\nLyons (1991); this avoids the failure of the standard approximate variance formula when the\nnumber of counts is small (see \u00a72.4.5 of Eadie et al. 1971). Note that the error distribution is\nnot Gaussian when the number of counts is small. Quoted band ratios have been corrected for\ndifferential vignetting between the hard band and soft band using the appropriate exposure\nmaps.\n\u2022 Column 10 gives the effective photon index (\u0393) for a power-law model with the Galactic\ncolumn density. This has been calculated based on the band ratio in column 9 whenever the\nnumber of counts is not \"low.\" A source with a low number of counts is defined as being (1)\ndetected in the soft band with < 30 counts and not detected in the hard band, (2) detected\nin the hard band with < 15 counts and not detected in the soft band, (3) detected in both\nthe soft and hard bands, but with < 15 counts in each, or (4) detected only in the full band.\nWhen the number of counts is low, the photon index is poorly constrained and set to \u0393 = 1.4,\na representative value for faint sources that should give reasonable fluxes.\n\u2022 Column 11 gives the effective exposure time derived from the full-band exposure map (see\n\u00a73.1 for details of the exposure maps).\n\u2022 Columns 12\u201315 give observed-frame fluxes in the four standard bands; fluxes are in units\nof 10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 . They have been corrected for vignetting but are not corrected for\nabsorption by the Galaxy or intrinsic to the source. For a power-law model with \u0393 = 1.4, the\nsoft-band and hard-band Galactic absorption corrections are \u2248 4.2% and \u2248 0.1%, respectively.\nFluxes have been computed using the counts in columns 5\u20138, the appropriate exposure maps,\nand the spectral slopes given in column 10.\n\u2022 Column 16 gives notes on the sources. \"H\" and \"C\" denote objects lying in the HDF-N\nand the Caltech area, respectively (see Figure 3). \"O\" refers to objects that have large\ncross-band positional offsets (> 2.\u2032\u2032 5). \"NP\" refers to objects where the source position could\nnot be updated to that from a no-PSF run. \"M\" refers to sources where the photometry\nwas performed manually. \"S\" refers to close double sources where manual separation was\nrequired. For further explanation of many of these notes, see the above text in this section\non manual correction of the wavdetect results.\nSome of the sources in Table 3 have been presented in Papers I\u2013IV. The source properties in Table 3\nsupersede those presented in earlier papers.\nFigures 9\u201312 display the basic properties of the sources in Table 3. In Figure 9 we plot the\npositions of the sources detected in the soft band and hard band; this format removes the illusory\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\neffect produced by the changing PSF size across the field of view. Figure 10 shows the distribution\nof full-band effective exposure time; this plot includes the ten sources that were not detected in\nthe full band (all of the sources that were not detected in the full band were detected in the\nsoft band, and the full-band and soft-band effective exposure times are similar). Figure 11 shows\n\"postage-stamp\" images in the full band for all detected sources. Figure 12 displays the band\nratio as a function of soft-band count rate for the detected Chandra sources. This plot shows the\nsame qualitative behavior as those from shallower surveys (e.g., Paper IV; Tozzi et al. 2001) and\npopulates the faint flux region more densely. The sources generally become harder at low softband count rates, although there is substantial dispersion. At the lowest soft-band count rates,\nthe source population is heterogeneous; highly absorbed AGN, high-redshift AGN, low-luminosity\nAGN, starburst galaxies, and normal galaxies all appear to make significant contributions (e.g.,\nPaper II; Paper IV; Paper VI; Tozzi et al. 2001). Understanding in detail the nature and relative\ncontributions of the source populations represented in Figure 12 will require extensive optical\nspectroscopic and multiwavelength follow-up studies.\nWe have inspected the sources in Table 3 for spatial extent, and they are generally consistent\nwith being pointlike (see Figure 11). The constraints on spatial extent are 20\u201340% worse than\nfor a single ACIS-I observation because, due to the different observation pointings and roll angles\ndescribed in \u00a72.2, there is not a single Chandra PSF applicable for any given source. The constraints\n< 5\u2032 are also substantially tighter than those at larger off-axis angles. Spatially\nat off-axis angles of \u223c\nextended sources are discussed in \u00a73.3.\nIn Table 4 we summarize the source detections in the four standard bands, and in Table 5 we\nsummarize the number of sources detected in one band but not another.\nOur faintest soft-band sources have \u2248 6 counts (about one every 1.8 days), and our faintest\nhard-band sources have \u2248 10 counts; these sources are detected near the aim point. For a \u0393 = 1.4\npower-law model with the Galactic column density, the corresponding 0.5\u20132.0 keV and 2\u20138 keV\nflux limits are \u2248 2.9 \u00d7 10\u221217 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 and \u2248 1.9 \u00d7 10\u221216 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , respectively. Of course,\nthese flux limits vary across the field of view. Using the restricted ACIS grade set, the background\nlevel in our region of highest exposure (see Figures 7 and 8) is 3.6 \u00d7 10\u22122 count pixel\u22121 in the soft\nband and 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22121 count pixel\u22121 in the hard band. In both of these bands we are far from being\nbackground limited for point source detection near the aim point.\n\n3.2.2.\n\nSupplementary Point Sources at Large Off-Axis Angles\n\nUnfortunately, there is no single choice of wavelet scales in wavdetect that provides perfect\nperformance across an entire Chandra field (Freeman et al. 2001; P.E. Freeman 2001, private communication). Compromises are required due to, for example, the dependence of the PSF size and\nshape on off-axis angle. In addition, due to the different observation pointings and roll angles described in \u00a72.2, there is not a single Chandra PSF applicable for any given source in this particular\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nfield. The wavelet scales used in \u00a73.2.1 have been empirically found to provide very good perfor\u221a\nmance across most of the field, but adding further large wavelet scales (e.g., 8 2 and 16 pixels)\ncan improve the detection effectiveness at large off-axis angles where the PSF is broad. However,\nthe addition of these scales can cause real sources at smaller off-axis angles to be missed due to\nthe incorrect merging of two sources. In addition, the \"rejection rule\" of wavdetect, designed\nto suppress Poisson fluctuations on scales smaller than the PSF, has limitations that can cause\nincorrect source rejections when large wavelet scales are employed (see \u00a73.2.3 of Freeman et al.\n2001; P.E. Freeman 2001, private communication). For example, incorrect source rejections may\noccur when only the relatively sharp core of the PSF is apparent above the background level.\nTo address this issue and provide the best possible performance at large off-axis angles, we have\ncreated a supplementary catalog of 11 additional sources found by wavdetect at large off-axis\n\u221a\nangles when wavelet scales of 8 2 and 16 pixels are added to those used in \u00a73.2.1 (see Table 6). We\nhave followed the same basic methodology as was used when making the main catalog (see \u00a73.2.1);\nwe have again adopted a false-positive probability threshold of 1 \u00d7 10\u22127 as the key criterion for\nsource detection. The catalog columns are the same as for the main catalog. Because the resulting\nsources tend to be the weakest ones detectable at the largest off-axis angles, their properties are in\ngeneral less well defined than those of the sources in the main catalog. We have manually inspected\nthese sources to confirm their reality.\n\n3.2.3.\n\nComparison with Previous Results for the HDF-N\n\nA comparison of the Chandra sources detected in the HDF-N here and in Paper IV gives\ngood agreement. All but one of the 12 sources detected in Paper IV are detected here as well.\nThe one source not detected here is CXOHDFN J123643.9+621249; this faint source is known\nto be variable (see Paper IV) and has dropped in flux, leading to a reduced signal-to-noise ratio\nin the longer observation.11 There is still a notable positive fluctuation at the location of CXOHDFN J123643.9+621249 (see Figure 6), and it is detected in the soft band if wavdetect is run\nwith a false-positive probability threshold of 1 \u00d7 10\u22126 . One other small difference from Paper IV is\nthat the position of CXOHDFN J123649.4+621347 has moved closer to the nucleus of its z = 0.089\nelliptical host galaxy (see \u00a73.1 of Paper IV); it is no longer clear that this faint X-ray source lies\noutside the nucleus.\nWith the additional data presented here, two new HDF-N X-ray sources have been discovered:\nCXOHDFN J123656.6+621245 and CXOHDFN J123657.4+621210. Both sources appear to be\nassociated with optically bright HDF-N galaxies, extending the trend noted in Paper IV. The first\nis W96 source 3-610.1 at z = 0.518 (Cohen et al. 2000), one of the optically brightest (V606 = 21.30)\n11\n\nWe note that there may be other faint, variable sources like CXOHDFN J123643.9+621249 that could be recovered\nby searching the data using many time segments. However, addressing this issue comprehensively is a challenging\ntask and is beyond the scope of this paper.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nspirals in the HDF-N. The second is W96 source 3-965.0 at z = 0.665 (Cohen et al. 2000), a bright\n(V606 = 22.23) elliptical near the edge of the HDF-N. The full-band X-ray luminosities of these\ngalaxies of \u2248 1 \u00d7 1041 erg s\u22121 and \u2248 3 \u00d7 1041 erg s\u22121 , respectively, can be explained via either\nlow-luminosity AGN or stellar remnants (e.g., X-ray binaries). Both of these galaxies were included\nin the stacking analysis of Paper IV, and their individual detections with additional data support\nthe validity of the stacking analysis.\nWe note that there are several other positive fluctuations in the HDF-N visible in Figure 6.\nWhile some of these align with bright HDF-N galaxies (e.g., the positive fluctuation near \u03b12000 = 12h\n36m 52.s 8, \u03b42000 = +62\u25e6 13\u2032 54\u2032\u2032 aligns with W96 source 2-736.0, a z = 1.355 irregular) and may well\nbe real, they are not formally detected according to the criteria in \u00a73.2.1 and will not be discussed\nfurther here.\n\n3.2.4.\n\nNumber Counts for the Point Sources\n\nWe have calculated cumulative number counts, N (> S), for the soft and hard bands using the\ndata in Table 3 and the basic method described in Gioia et al. (1990). The results are shown in\nFigure 13, along with some results from ROSAT and ASCA. The CDF-N number counts do not\nextend to higher fluxes due to the limited number of bright sources available in our data.\nWe have been conservative in our source selection, taking several steps to prevent incompleteness (due to the varying sensitivity as a function of spatial position) from affecting the N (> S)\ncurves. To avoid incompleteness in the soft band, we have only used data which satisfy the softband requirements in Table 7 on (1) distance from the average aim point and (2) soft-band effective\nexposure time. The second requirement has the effect of removing areas affected by the gaps between the CCDs, where incompleteness is difficult to assess (see Figure 7). In Table 7 we also list\nthe solid angle satisfying the above requirements. We have only extended the soft-band N (> S)\ndown to 4.2 \u00d7 10\u221217 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 since, even near the average aim point, incompleteness may\n< 8 soft-band counts.\naffect the N (> S) at fainter fluxes; sources below this flux typically have \u223c\n+1100\n\u22122\nAt this flux limit, the source density is 7100\u2212940 deg . The Chandra and ROSAT constraints\non the soft-band N (> S) are consistent in the limited region of overlap. We have fit the CDF-N\nN (> S) curve in the flux range 5 \u00d7 10\u221217 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 to 2 \u00d7 10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 using a maximum\nlikelihood technique (Murdoch, Crawford, & Jauncey 1973). The best fit is\n\nN (> S) = 3970\n\n\u0012\n\nS\n1 \u00d7 10\u221216\n\n\u0013\u22120.67\u00b10.14\n\n.\n\nTo avoid incompleteness in the hard band, we have only used data which satisfy the hardband requirements in Table 7. We have only extended the hard-band N (> S) down to 3.8 \u00d7\n10\u221216 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 since, even near the average aim point, incompleteness may affect the N (> S)\n< 12 hard-band counts. At this flux limit,\nat fainter fluxes; sources below this flux typically have \u223c\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n\u22122\nthe source density is 4200+670\n\u2212580 deg . There is very little overlap between the Chandra constraints\non the hard-band N (> S) and those from earlier missions. The best fit to the CDF-N N (> S)\ncurve in the flux range above 1.5 \u00d7 10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 is\n\nN (> S) = 2820\n\n\u0012\n\nS\n1 \u00d7 10\u221215\n\n\u0013\u22121.0\u00b10.3\n\n.\n\nAt fainter fluxes the number counts clearly flatten (see Figure 13b), and parameterization of them\nrequires a detailed analysis of the differential counts (see Jauncey 1975 and references therein). This\nanalysis, along with a more detailed study of the number counts in the CDF-N, will be presented\nin G.P. Garmire et al., in preparation.\nWe have also experimented with somewhat less conservative source-selection methods than\nthose used above, and these give N (> S) curves that are consistent with those presented above to\nwithin the expected statistical uncertainties. In the hard band, in fact, varying the source selection\nmethod gives almost identical results.\nIn Figure 14 we compare our N (> S) curves with those from Mushotzky et al. (2000) and Tozzi\net al. (2001). In the soft band, our N (> S) curve is above those of both Mushotzky et al. (2000)\nand Tozzi et al. (2001), even at quite bright X-ray fluxes. However, the results are not discrepant\ngiven the error bars, and any small differences could be due to field-to-field \"cosmic variance.\" In\nthe hard band, our N (> S) curve is consistent with those of Mushotzky et al. (2000) and Tozzi\net al. (2001) at fluxes above 3 \u00d7 10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , and at fainter fluxes it is intermediate between\nthe two curves.\n\n3.3.\n\nExtended-Source Detection and Results\n\nWe have searched the standard-band images for extended X-ray sources using the CXC's\nVoronoi Tessellation and Percolation algorithm vtpdetect (Ebeling & Wiedenmann 1993; Dobrzycki et al. 1999). We have used a false-positive probability threshold of 1 \u00d7 10\u22127 , and we require\nat least 50 counts per source. Extended source detections were checked by inspection of adaptively\nsmoothed images.\nIn Figure 15 we show the two most significant extended sources revealed by our source detection: CXOHDFN J123620.0+621554 and CXOHDFN J123756.0+621506. Both of these sources\nare detected most clearly in the soft-band image. We have checked for possible problems with these\nsource detections and find none. The exposure map is relatively smooth near both of these sources,\nso background gradients should not have confused the extended source detection. In addition, both\nof these sources are visible in adaptively smoothed soft-band images made using only data with\nroll angles of 36.4\u201344.5\u25e6 or 134.3\u2013143.8\u25e6 (see Table 1); this argues against an instrumental origin\nof these sources. CXOHDFN J123620.0+621554 has 274 \u00b1 37 soft-band counts and no obvious\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\noptical counterpart in the I-band image of Barger et al. (1999), suggesting a fairly high redshift\ngroup or cluster. The counts for extended sources here and hereafter were determined with manual aperture photometry excluding point sources and regions of strongly varying background; for\nCXOHDFN J123620.0+621554 we used an elliptical aperture with semimajor axis 45\u2032\u2032 , semiminor\naxis 25\u2032\u2032 , and position angle 145\u25e6 . CXOHDFN J123756.0+621506 has 303 \u00b1 26 soft-band counts (in\nan elliptical aperture with semimajor axis 25\u2032\u2032 , semiminor axis 18\u2032\u2032 , and position angle 55\u25e6 ). In the\nR-band image of Liu et al. (1999), it coincides with a pair of optically bright galaxies that appear\nto be interacting; the X-ray source is likely to be a low-to-moderate redshift group.\nOne additional extended source detected by vtpdetect with lower significance than the two\nabove is CXOHDFN J123645.0+621142 (see Figure 16); we consider this source to be marginally\ndetected. This source is notable because it is in the HDF-N itself near the z = 1.013 Fanaroff-Riley I\n(FR I) radio galaxy VLA J123644.3+621133 and a number of other z \u2248 1.01 objects (e.g., Richards\net al. 1998). In Paper IV we detected the FR I (as CXOHDFN J123644.3+621132) and searched for\ncluster X-ray emission in its vicinity because FR I sources are often located in clusters of galaxies.\nNo cluster emission was found, but with the additional data here it appears likely that such emission\nwas present just below the detection threshold attainable in Paper IV. The FR I lies within the\nemission but appears offset from its (poorly defined) center. CXOHDFN J123645.0+621142 has\n\u2248 100 soft-band counts (in a circular aperture with radius 30\u2032\u2032 ). Because there are substantially\nmore counts in the putative cluster emission than from the FR I, we are confident that this emission\nis not merely due to counts from the FR I in the wings of the PSF.\nInspection of the raw and adaptively smoothed soft-band images revealed the likely presence\nof diffuse emission near the positions 123557.0+621551, 123704.6+621652, and 123721.2+621526.\nPossible groups or clusters are apparent in the R-band image of Liu et al. (1999) or the I-band\nimage of Barger et al. (1999) near these positions. Optical spectroscopy is required for confirmation.\nDawson et al. (2001) have discovered a z = 0.85 cluster centered near \u03b12000 = 12h 36m 39.s 6,\n\u03b42000 = +62\u25e6 15\u2032 54\u2032\u2032 . Unfortunately, this position is near one of the strongest CCD gap features in\nthe exposure map (see Figure 7). Inspection of the adaptively smoothed soft-band image for diffuse\nemission shows a possible \u2248 50 event enhancement near cluster member F 36397+1547 (see Table 4\nof Dawson et al. 2001), but this is not formally detected by vtpdetect and could be due to a\nfaint point source. We do clearly detect X-ray emission from cluster member F 36421+1545; this\nsource appears to be pointlike.\nWe have also inspected the Chandra images near the Wide Angle Tail (WAT) radio galaxy\nVLA J123725.7+621128 (Muxlow et al. 1999) since WATs are often found in clusters of galaxies.\nWe find no hint of any extended X-ray emission centered near this source.\nExtended sources will be discussed in further detail in F.E. Bauer et al., in preparation.\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\n4.\n\nConclusions and Summary\n\nThese CDF-N observations will contribute greatly to the resolution of some of the outstanding\nquestions in extragalactic X-ray astronomy. Near the aim point, they have reached soft-band and\n\u22122 (at 4.2 \u00d7 10\u221217 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 ) and 4200+670 deg\u22122 (at\nhard-band source densities of 7100+1100\n\u2212940 deg\n\u2212580\n3.8 \u00d7 10\u221216 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 ), respectively. This paper has described the details of the observations,\ndata reduction, and technical analysis and presented 1 Ms source catalogs. It will require many\nyears of work to investigate all of the presented sources in detail. This survey should remain one\nof the deepest ever made from 0.5\u20138.0 keV until missions such as the X-ray Evolving Universe\nSpectroscopy (XEUS ) mission begin operation,12 and we hope to extend this survey to an exposure\nof 5\u201310 Ms given the continued operation of Chandra; we have been allocated an additional 1 Ms\nin Chandra Cycle 3 (all data will become public immediately). The current 1 Ms survey is far\nfrom the limit of Chandra's capability. The detector background is so low that, with appropriate\ngrade screening, we will not fully enter the background-limited regime near the aim point for\n< 5 Ms (for the full band; the situation is even better for the soft band due\nexposure times of \u223c\nto its substantially lower background). A 5 Ms exposure would achieve soft-band and hard-band\nsensitivities of \u2248 6 \u00d7 10\u221218 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 and \u2248 4 \u00d7 10\u221217 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , respectively, as well as\nprovide detailed spectral, variability, and morphological constraints on the sources in the present\ncatalog. It would provide key information on the existence and nature of the sources to be targeted\nby future missions such as XEUS , laying the groundwork for these missions. XMM-Newton will\nperform deeper surveys in the \u2248 8\u201312 keV band, but cross-correlation of the sources found by XMMNewton with those presented here will still be important to refine the XMM-Newton positions and\nminimize source confusion.\nThe source catalogs and images shown in Figure 3 are available on the World Wide Web.13\nWe will continue to improve the source catalogs as better calibration information, analysis methods\nand software become available. For example, we plan to optimize the searching for variable sources\nand search more sensitively for X-ray sources that correlate with sources at other wavelengths.\nImproved searching for diffuse sources will be performed as the Chandra background becomes\nbetter understood.\nThis work would not have been possible without the enormous efforts of the entire Chandra\nand ACIS teams.

Shown are the Uhuru survey (e.g., Forman et al. 1978), the ROSAT All-Sky\nSurvey (RASS; e.g., Voges et al. 1999), the Einstein Extended Medium-Sensitivity Survey (EMSS;\ne.g., Gioia et al. 1990), the ROSAT International X-ray/Optical Survey (RIXOS; e.g., Mason et al.\n2000), the XMM-Newton Serendipitious Surveys (XMM-Newton Bright, XMM-Newton Medium,\nXMM-Newton Faint; e.g., Watson et al. 2001), the Chandra Multiwavelength Project (ChaMP;\ne.g., Wilkes et al. 2001), the ROSAT Ultra Deep Survey (UDS; e.g., Lehmann et al. 2001), the\ndeep XMM-Newton survey of the Lockman Hole (XMM-Newton LH; e.g., Hasinger et al. 2001),\nChandra 100 ks surveys (e.g., Mushotzky et al. 2000), and Chandra 1 Ms surveys (i.e., the CDF-N\nsurvey and the Chandra Deep Field South survey). Solid dots are for surveys that have been\ncompleted, and open circles are for surveys that are in progress. Clearly, each of the surveys shown\nhas a range of flux limits across its solid angle (due to effects such as off-axis PSF broadening and\nvignetting); we have generally shown the most sensitive flux limit. The dotted curves show, from\ntop to bottom, the loci of 100, 1000, and 10000 0.5\u20132.0 keV sources (these have been calculated\nusing the number counts of Hasinger et al. 1998, Paper III, and \u00a73.2.4); for example, a 1 degree2\nsurvey with a 0.5\u20132.0 keV flux limit of 9.5 \u00d7 10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 will detect \u2248 100 sources.

The crosses are Chandra sources with 10\u201350\ncounts, the open circles are Chandra sources with 50\u2013100 counts, and the solid dots are Chandra\nsources with > 100 counts. The X-ray positions are usually good to within \u2248 0.\u2032\u2032 6 for off-axis angles\n< 5\u2032 . At larger off-axis angles, where the HRMA PSF rapidly broadens and becomes complex, the\npositional accuracy, as expected, degrades. The Chandra source positions have been determined\nfollowing \u00a73.2.1; positions from no-PSF runs were used whenever possible.\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Images of the CDF-N in the (a) full band, (b) soft band, (c) hard band, and (d) ultrahard\nband.

The light grooves running\nthrough the images correspond to the gaps between the CCDs. The small polygon indicates the\nHDF-N, and the large square indicates the area covered by the Caltech Faint Field Galaxy Redshift\nSurvey (e.g., Hogg et al. 2000; hereafter the \"Caltech area\").

The adaptive smoothing has been performed using the code of Ebeling,\nWhite, & Rangarajan (2001) at the 2.5\u03c3 level, and the grayscales are linear. Much of the apparent\ndiffuse emission is just instrumental background; see \u00a73.3 for a discussion of extended sources. The\nedges of the image appear \"rounded\" due to the combination of the dither of Chandra and the\nrequirement that the effective exposure time exceed 50 ks (see \u00a73.1).

Sources detected in this paper are labeled; labels are given\nimmediately to the left of the corresponding X-ray sources, and redshifts are given immediately\nabove the corresponding X-ray sources. The unlabeled enhancements apparent in the HDF-N are\ndiscussed in \u00a73.2.3.

The light grooves running through the exposure map correspond\nto the gaps between the CCDs and bad columns. The small white polygon indicates the HDF-N\nitself, the large white square indicates the Caltech area, and the large white polygon indicates a\n\"high-exposure area\" where the median exposure time is > 800 ks. The black outline surrounding\nthe exposure map indicates the extent of all the ACIS-I observations; the regions of the exposure\nmap near the outline appear white due to low exposure (20\u2013200 ks).\n\n\f\u2013 31 \u2013\n\nFig. 8.- Amount of survey solid angle having at least a given amount of effective exposure in the\nfull-band exposure map.

To reduce\nsymbol crowding, we do not show error bars for each of the small solid dots. Instead, the large solid\ndots show average band ratios and error bars for the small solid dots as a function of soft-band\ncount rate (these large solid dots are given only to show the size of the errors, and they should\nnot be interpreted statistically). The open circles show average band ratios derived from stacking\nanalyses (following \u00a73.3 of Paper VI).
