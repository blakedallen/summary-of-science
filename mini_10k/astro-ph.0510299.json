The\nPrime Focus Camera (Suprime-Cam) on the Subaru telescope was used to obtain BRIz\u2032 imaging over 2 \u00d7 940\narcmin2 fields, while JKs imaging was provided by the SOFI camera at the New Technology Telescope (NTT)\nfor a subset of the area, partly from the ESO Imaging Survey (EIS). In this paper, we report on the properties of\nK-band\u2013selected galaxies, identified from a total area of \u223c 920 arcmin2 to KVega = 19, of which 320 arcmin2\nare complete to KVega = 20. The BzK selection technique was used to assemble complete samples of about\n500 candidate massive star-forming galaxies (sBzKs) and about 160 candidate massive passively evolving\n< z < 2.5; and the (R \u2212 K)\ngalaxies (pBzKs) at 1.4 \u223c\nVega > 5 color criterion was used to assemble a sample of\n\u223c\nabout 850 extremely red objects (EROs). We accurately measure surface densities of 1.20 \u00b1 0.05 arcmin\u22122 and\n0.38 \u00b1 0.03 arcmin\u22122 for the sBzKs and the pBzKs, respectively. Both sBzKs and pBzKs are strongly clustered,\nat a level at least comparable to that of EROs, with pBzKs appearing more clustered than sBzKs. We estimate\nthe reddening, star formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses (M\u2217 ) for the ensemble of sBzKs, confirming\nthat to KVega \u223c 20 typical (median) values are M\u2217 \u223c 1011 M\u2299 , SFR \u223c 190 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , and E(B \u2212 V ) \u223c 0.44. A\ncorrelation is detected such that the most massive galaxies at z \u223c 2 are also the most actively star-forming, an\neffect that can be seen as a manifestation of downsizing at early epochs. The space density of massive pBzKs\nat z \u223c 1.4 \u2212 2 that we derive is 20%\u00b17% that of similarly massive early-type galaxies at z \u223c 0. Adding this\nspace density to that of our massive star forming class, sBzKs, in the same redshift range produces a closer\ncomparison with the local early-type galaxy population, naturally implying that we are detecting star formation\nin a sizable fraction of massive galaxies at z > 1.4, which has been quenched by the present day. Follow-up\noptical and near infrared spectroscopy is in progress at the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) and at the Subaru\ntelescope, in order to elucidate more thoroughly the formation and evolution of massive galaxies.\nSubject headings: galaxies: evolution - galaxies: high-redshift - cosmology: observations - galaxies:\nphotometry\n1.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDespite the recent extraordinary progress in observational\ncosmology and the successful convergence on a single cosmological model, galaxy formation and evolution largely remain an open issue. One critical aspect is how and when\nthe present-day most massive galaxies (e.g. elliptical galax> 1011 M ) were built up and what\nies and bulges with M\u2217 \u223c\n\u2299\ntype of evolution characterized their growth over cosmic\ntime (e.g., Cimatti et al. 2004; Glazebrook et al. 2004, and\nreferences therein). Indeed, various current renditions of\nthe \u039bCDM hierarchical merging paradigm differ enormously\nin this respect, with some models predicting the virtually\ncomplete disappearance of such galaxies by z = 1 \u2212 2 (e.g.,\n1 Based on data collected at Subaru Telescope (program S02B-101), which\nis operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan. Also based\non data collected at the New Technology Telescope (program IDs 169.A0725; 67.A-0244(A); 164.O-0561), which is operated by the European Southern Observatory.\n\nCole et al. 2000; Menci et al. 2002; Somerville 2004a) and\nother models predicting a quite mild evolution, more in line\nwith observations (e.g., Nagamine et al. 2001; 2005; Granato\net al. 2004; Somerville et al. 2004b; a direct comparison of\nsuch models can be found in Fig. 9 of Fontana et al. 2004).\nMoreover, models that provide an acceptable fit to the galaxy\nstellar mass function at z > 1 may differ considerably in the\n> 1011 M at z > 1,\nactual properties of the galaxies with M\u2217 \u223c\n\u2299\n\u223c\nwith some models predicting very few, if any, passively evolving galaxies at these redshifts, at variance with recent findings\n(Cimatti et al. 2004; McCarthy et al. 2004; Daddi et al. 2005a;\nSaracco et al. 2005).\nWhile various \u039bCDM models may agree with each other\nat z \u223c 0 (where they all are tuned) their dramatic divergence\nwith increasing redshift gives us powerful leverage to restrict the choice among them, thus aiding understanding of\nthe physics of galaxy formation and evolution. Hence, a direct observational mapping of galaxy evolution through cos-\n\n\f2\n\nX. Kong et al.\n\nmic time is particularly important and rewarding, especially\n< z < 3 can\nif a significant number of massive galaxies at 1 \u223c\n\u223c\nbe identified and studied. In this regard, the critical questions concern the evolution with redshift of the number density of massive galaxies and their star formation histories,\nas reflected by their colors and spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs). These questions have just started to be addressed\nby various spectroscopy projects, such as the K20 survey\n(Cimatti et al. 2002a, 52 arcmin2), the Hubble Deep Fields\n(HDFs; Ferguson et al. 2000, 5.3 arcmin2 in the HDF-North\nand 4.4 arcmin2 in the HDF-South), the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS; Giavalisco et al. 2004,\n320 arcmin2 in the North and South fields combined) the\nHST/ACS Ultra Deep Field (S. Beckwith et al. 2006, in preparation; 12 arcmin2 ), the Gemini Deep Deep Survey (Abraham\net al. 2004, 121 arcmin2 ), and the extension down to z \u223c 2\nof the Lyman break galaxy (LBG) project (Steidel et al. 2004,\n\u223c 100 arcmin2). However, massive galaxies are quite rare\nand likely highly clustered at all redshifts, and hence small\nareas such as those explored so far are subject to large cosmic variance (Daddi et al. 2000; Bell et al. 2004; Somerville\net al. 2004c). Therefore, although these observation have\ndemonstrated that old, passive and massive galaxies do exist\nin the field out to z \u223c 2, it remains to be firmly established how\ntheir number and evolutionary properties evolve with redshift\nup to z \u223c 2 and beyond.\nTo make a major step forward we are undertaking fairly\ndeep, wide-field imaging with the Suprime-Cam on Subaru\nof two fields of 940 arcmin2 each for part of which nearIR data are available from ESO New Technology Telescope\n(NTT) observations. The extensive imaging has supported\nthe spectroscopic follow-up with the VLT and the Subaru\ntelescopes, for which part of the data have already been secured. The prime aim of this survey is to understand how and\nwhen the present-day massive galaxies formed, and to this\nend, the imaging observations have been optimized for the\nuse of optical/near-IR multi-color selection criteria to identify\nboth star-forming and passive galaxies at z \u2248 2.\nColor criteria are quite efficient in singling out high redshift\ngalaxies. The best-known example is the dropout technique\nfor selecting LBGs (Steidel et al. 1996). Besides targeting\nLBGs, color criteria have also been used to search for passively evolving galaxies at high redshifts, such as extremely\nred objects (EROs) at redshifts z \u223c 1 (Thompson et al. 1999;\nMcCarthy 2004) and distant red galaxies (DRGs) at redshifts\n> 2 (Franx et al. 2003).\nz\u223c\nRecently, using the highly complete spectroscopic redshift\ndatabase of the K20 survey, Daddi et al. (2004a) introduced\na new criterion for obtaining virtually complete samples of\n< z < 2.5, based on B, z\ngalaxies in the redshift range 1.4 \u223c\n\u223c\n2\nand Ks imaging: star-forming galaxies are identified requiring BzK = (z \u2212 K)AB \u2212 (B \u2212 z)AB > \u22120.2 (for convenience,\nwe use the term sBzKs for galaxies selected in this way); and\n> 1.4 requiring BzK < \u22120.2\npassively evolving galaxies at z \u223c\nand (z \u2212 K)AB > 2.5 (hereafter pBzKs). This criterion is reddening independent for star-forming galaxies in the selected\nredshift range, thus allowing us also to select the reddest most\ndust-extinguished galaxies, together with those that are old\nand passively evolving. This should allow for a relatively unbiased selection of z \u223c 2 galaxies within the magnitude limit\nof the samples studied.\nIn this paper observations, data reduction and galaxy pho2\n\nhereafter K band for short\n\ntometry are described, together with the first results on Kband selected samples of distant, high redshift massive galaxies. Compared to optical, the near-IR selection (in particular\nin the K band) offers several advantages, including the relative insensitivity of the k-corrections to galaxy type, even\nat high redshift, the less severe dust extinction effects, the\nweaker dependence on the instantaneous star formation activity, and a tighter correlation with the stellar mass of the\ngalaxies. Therefore, the study of faint galaxy samples selected in the near-infrared have long been recognized as ideal\ntools to study the process of mass assembly at high redshift\n(Broadhurst et al. 1992; Kauffmann & Charlot 1998; Cimatti\net al. 2002a).\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the\nobservations and the data reduction. Section 3 discusses the\nphotometric calibration of the images. Section 4 presents the\nselection and number counts for EROs, sBzKs, and pBzKs.\nSection 5 presents the analysis of the clustering of field galaxies, EROs, sBzKs, and pBzKs. The properties of sBzKs are\npresented in Section 6. Finally, a brief summary is presented\nin Section 7. Throughout the paper, we use the Salpeter IMF\nextending between 0.1 and 100 M\u2299 and a cosmology with\n\u03a9\u039b = 0.7, \u03a9M = 0.3, and h = H0 (km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 )/100 = 0.71.\nFor the sake of comparison with previous works, magnitudes\nand colors in both AB and Vega systems have to be used.3\n2.\n\nOBSERVATIONS\n\nTwo widely separated fields were imaged as a part of our\nsurvey: one centered at \u03b1(J2000)= 11h 24m 50s , \u03b4(J2000)=\n\u221221\u25e642\u2032 00\u2032\u2032 (hereafter Deep3a-F), and the the second, the\nso-called \"Daddi field\" (hereafter Daddi-F; Daddi et al. 2000)\ncentered at \u03b1(J2000)= 14h 49m 29s , \u03b4(J2000)= 09\u25e6 00\u2032 00\u2032\u2032 .\nDetails of the optical and near-IR observations are shown in\nTable 1. Figure 1 shows the layout of the two areas observed.\n2.1. Near-IR imaging and data reduction\nInfrared observations in the near-infrared passband J and\nKs were obtained using the SOFI camera (Moorwood, Cuby\n& Lidman 1998) mounted on the New Technology Telescope\n(NTT) at La Silla. SOFI is equipped with a Rockwell 10242\ndetector, which, when used together with its large field objective, provides images with a pixel scale of 0\u2032\u2032 .29 and a field of\nview of \u223c 4.9 \u00d7 4.9 arcmin2.\nDeep3a-F is part of the ESO Deep Public Survey (DPS)\ncarried out by the ESO Imaging Survey (EIS) program (Renzini & da Costa 1999) (see http://www.eso.org/science/eis/).\nThe Deep3a SOFI observations cover a total area of about\n920 arcmin2 in the K band, most at the relatively shallow limits of KVega \u223c 19.0\u201319.5. About 320 arcmin2 , the region used\nin the present paper, have much deeper integrations with a\nminimum 3600s per sky pixel (and up to 2 hr) reaching to\n> 20 and J\n>\nKVega \u223c\nVega \u223c 22. The NTT J- and K-band images\nof Deep3a-F were retrieved from the ESO Science Archive\nand reduced using the EIS/MVM pipeline for automated reduction of optical/infrared images (Vandame 2002). The software produces fully reduced images and weight-maps carrying out bias subtraction, flat-fielding, de-fringing, background\nsubtraction, first-order pixel-based image stacking (allowing\nfor translation, rotation and stretching of the image) and astrometric calibration.

The RGB colors are assigned to z-, I-, and B-band images, 940 arcmin2 ,\nrespectively. The green area outlined near the center of the images is the field where K-band images have been obtained by NTT (600 arcmin2 area for Daddi-F\nand 320 arcmin2 area for Deep3a-F).\n\nwas based on the astrometric solution.\nPhotometric calibration was performed using standard stars\nfrom Persson et al. (1998), and the calibration performed as\nlinear fits in airmass and color index whenever the airmass and\ncolor coverage allowed for it. The reduced NTT K-band data\nand WHT R-band data for Daddi-F were taken from Daddi\net al. (2000). The average seeing and the size of the final coadded images are reported in Table 1.\n2.2. Optical imaging and data reduction\nDeep optical imaging was obtained with the Prime Focus Camera on the Subaru Telescope, Suprime-Cam, which\n\nwith its 10 2k \u00d74k MIT/LL CCDs covers a contiguous area\nof 34\u2032 \u00d7 27\u2032 with a pixel scale of 0.\u2032\u2032 202 pixel\u22121 (Miyazaki\net al. 2002). Deep3a-F was observed with the four standard\nbroad-band filters, B, Rc (hereafter R band), I, and z\u2032 (hereafter\nz band) on the two nights of 2003 March 4\u20135 with 0\u2032\u2032 .7 \u2212 0\u2032\u2032.9\nseeing. During the same nights also Daddi-F was imaged in B,\nI, and z to a somewhat shallower magnitude limit to match the\nshallower R and K data from Daddi et al. (2000). A relatively\nlong unit exposure time of several hundred seconds was used\nin order to reach background-noise-dominated levels. For this\nreason bright stars, which are saturated in the optical images,\nhave been excluded by subsequent analysis.\n\n\f4\n\nX. Kong et al.\n\nDuring the same nights the photometric standard-star field\nSA95 (Landolt 1992) was observed for B\u2212, \u2212R, and I\u2212band\nflux calibration, and the SDSS standard-star fields SA95190 and SA95-193 were observed for z-band flux calibration\n(Smith et al. 2002).\nThe Subaru imaging was reduced using the pipeline package SDFRED (Yagi et al. 2002; Ouchi et al. 2004). The\npackage includes overscan correction, bias subtraction, flatfielding, correction for image distortion, PSF matching (by\nGaussian smoothing), sky subtraction, and mosaicking. Bias\nsubtraction and flat fielding were processed in the same manner as for the conventional single chip CCD.\nIn mosaicking, the relative positions (shifts and rotations)\nand relative throughput between frames taken with different\nCCDs and exposures are calculated using stars common to\nadjacent frames and running SExtractor (Bertin & Arnout\n1996) with an S/N = 10 threshold.\n3.\n\nPHOTOMETRY\n\nWe obtained K-selected catalogs of objects in our survey by detecting sources in the K-band mosaics. For the\nDaddi-F we used the sample of K-selected galaxies defined\nin Daddi et al. (2000). SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts\n1996) was used to perform the image analysis and source\ndetection in Deep3a-F. The total magnitudes were then defined as the brightest between the Kron automatic aperture\nmagnitudes and the corrected aperture magnitude. Multicolor\nphotometry in all the available bands was obtained by running SExtractor in double image mode, after aligning all\nimaging to the K-band mosaic. Colors were measured using\n2\u2032\u2032 diameter aperture magnitudes, corrected for the flux loss\nof stars. The aperture corrections were estimated from the\ndifference between the SExtractor Kron automatic aperture magnitudes (MAG_AUTO) and the 2\u2032\u2032 aperture magnitudes, resulting in a range of 0.10 \u2013 0.30 mag, depending on\nthe seeing. All magnitudes were corrected for Galactic extinction (AB = 0.18 and 0.13 for Deep3a-F and Daddi-F, respectively) taken from Schlegel et al. (1998), using the empirical selective extinction function of Cardelli et al. (1989), with\nRV = AV /E(B \u2212 V) = 3.1.\nIn Deep3a-F we selected objects to KVega < 20, over a total\nsky area of 320 arcmin2 . Simulations of point sources show\nthat in all the area the completeness is well above 90% at these\nK-band levels. We recall that objects in Daddi-F were selected\nto completeness limits of KVega < 18.8 over an area of 700\narcmin2 (but we limit our discussion in this paper to the 600\narcmin2 covered by the Subaru observations) and to KVega <\n19.2 over a sub-area of 440 arcmin2 (see Daddi et al. 2000 for\nmore details).\nThe total area surveyed, as discussed in this paper, therefore ranges from a combined area of 920 arcmin2 (Daddi-F\nand Deep3a-F) at KVega < 18.8 to 320 arcmin2 (Deep3a-F) at\nKVega < 20.\nObjects in Deep3a-F and Daddi-F were cross-correlated\nwith those available from the 2MASS survey (Cutri\net al. 2003) in the J and K bands, resulting in good photometric agreement at better than the 3% level. In order to further\nverify the photometric zero points we checked the colors of\nstars (Fig. 2), selected from the BzK diagram following Daddi\net al. (2004a; see Sect.3.1). From these color-color planes, we\nfind that the colors of stellar objects in our data are consistent with those of Pickles (1998), with offsets, if any, of < 0.1\nmag at most. Similar agreement is found with the Lejeune\n\net al. (1997) models.\nFigure 3 shows a comparison of K-band number counts in\nour survey with a compilation of literature counts. No attempt\nwas made to correct for different filters (Ks or K). No corrections for incompleteness were applied to our data, and we excluded the stars, using the method in Sect. 3.1. The filled circles and filled squares correspond, respectively, to the counts\nof Deep3a-F and Daddi-F. As shown in the figure, our counts\nare in good agreement with those of previous surveys.\n3.1. Star-galaxy separation\nStellar objects are isolated with the color criterion (Daddi\net al. 2004a) (z \u2212 K)AB < 0.3(B \u2212 z)AB \u2212 0.5. In Fig. 4 we\ncompare the efficiency of such a color-based star-galaxy classification with the one based on the SExtractor parameter\nCLASS_STAR, which is based on the shape of the object's\nprofile in the imaging data. It is clear that the color classification is superior, allowing us to reliably classify stars up\nto the faintest limits in the survey. However, SExtractor\nappear to find resolved in the imaging data a small fraction\nof objects that are color-classified as stars. Most likely, these\nare blue galaxies scattered into the stellar color boundaries by\nphotometric uncertainties.\n4.\n\nCANDIDATES OF s B z K s, pB z K s AND ERO s\n\nIn this section, we select sBzKs, pBzKs and EROs in the\nDeep3a-F and Daddi-F, using the multicolor catalog based\non the NIR K-band image (see Sect. 3). Forthcoming papers\nwill discuss the selection of DRGs (J \u2212 K > 2.3 objects) and\nLBGs, using the BRIzJK photometry from our database.\n4.1. Selection of sBzKs and pBzKs\nIn order to apply the BzK selection criteria consistently\nwith Daddi et al. (2004a), we first accounted for the different shapes of the filters used, and applied a correction term\nto the B-band. The B-band filter used at the Subaru telescope is significantly redder than that used at the VLT by\nDaddi et al. (2004a). We then carefully compared the stellar\nsequence in our survey to that of Daddi et al. (2004a), using\nthe Pickles (1998) stellar spectra and the Lejeune et al. (1997)\ncorrected models as a guide, and applied small color terms to\nB\u2212 z and z\u2212 K (smaller than \u223c 0.1 mags in all cases), in order\nto obtain a fully consistent match. In the following we refer to\nBzK photometry for the system defined in this way, consistent\nwith the original BzK definition by Daddi et al. (2004a).\nFigure 5 shows the BzK color diagram of K-selected objects in Deep3a-F and Daddi-F. Using the color criterion from\nDaddi et al. (2004a), BzK \u2261 (z \u2212 K)AB \u2212 (B \u2212 z)AB > \u22120.2,\n387 galaxies with KVega < 20 were selected in Deep3a-F as\nsBzKs, which occupy a narrow range on the left of the solid\nline in Fig. 5a. Using BzK < \u22120.2 and (z \u2212 K)AB > 2.5, 121\nobjects were selected as candidate pBzKs, which lie in the\ntop-right part of Fig. 5a. To KVega < 20 a surface density of\n1.20 \u00b1 0.05 arcmin\u22122 and of 0.38 \u00b1 0.03 arcmin\u22122 is derived\nseparately for sBzKs and pBzKs, respectively (Poisson's errors only). The surface density of sBzKs is larger but still\nconsistent within 2\u03c3 with the 0.91 \u00b1 0.13 arcmin\u22122 found in\nthe 52 arcmin2 of the K20 field (Daddi et al. 2004a), and with\nthe 1.10 \u00b1 0.08 arcmin\u22122 found in the GOODS North field\n(Daddi et al. 2005b). Instead, the surface density of pBzKs\nrecovered here is significantly larger than what found in both\nfields. This may well be the result of cosmic variance, given\nthe strong clustering of pBzKs (see Section 5), and their lower\noverall surface density.\n\n\fSurvey for High-Redshift Massive Galaxies I.\n\n5\n\nF IG . 2.- Optical two-color plots of K-selected objects in our survey: the left panels show B \u2212 R vs. R \u2212 I colors; the right panels have B \u2212 I vs. R \u2212 z colors\n(all in AB scale). Galaxies are shown as filled points and stars with green asterisks (based on the BzK color star-galaxy seperation, Sect. 3.1). [See the electronic\nedition of the Journal for the color version of this figure.]\n\nUsing the same criteria, we select sBzKs and pBzKs in the\nDaddi-F field. In Daddi-F 108 sBzKs and 48 pBzKs are selected, and they are plotted in Fig. 5c. The density of sBzKs\nand pBzKs in Daddi-F is consistent with that in Deep3a, if\n< 19.\nlimited at KVega \u223c\n4.2. Selection of EROs\nEROs were first identified in K-band surveys by Elston,\nRieke, & Rieke (1988), and are defined here as objects having red optical-to-infrared colors such that (R \u2212 K)Vega \u2265\n5\u20136, corresponding to (R \u2212 K)AB \u2265 3.35\u20134.35. EROs are\nknown to be a mixture of mainly two different populations\n> 0.8; passively evolving old elliptical galaxies and dusty\nat z \u223c\nstarburst (or edge-on spiral) galaxies whose UV luminosities\nare strongly absorbed by internal dust (Cimatti et al. 2002b;\nYan et al. 2004, Moustakas et al. 2004). In Daddi-F, EROs\nwere selected and studied by Daddi et al. (2000) using various\nR\u2212 K thresholds. In order to apply a consistent ERO selection\nin Deep3a-F, we considered the filter shapes and transmission\ncurves. While the same K-band filters (and the same telescope and instrument) were used for K-band imaging in the\ntwo fields, the R-band filters used in the two fields differ substantially. In the Daddi-F the WHT R-band filter was used,\nwhich is very similar, e.g., to the R-band filter of FORS at\nthe VLT used by the K20 survey (Cimatti et al. 2002a). The\n\nSubaru+Suprime-Cam R-band filter is much narrower than\nthe above, although it does have a very close effective wavelength. As a result, distant z \u223c 1 early-type galaxy spectra\nas well as M-type stars appear to have much redder R \u2212 K\ncolor, by about \u22480.3 mag, depending on exact redshift and\nspectral shape. Therefore, we selected EROs in Deep3a-F\nwith the criterion RSubaru \u2212 K > 3.7 (AB magnitudes), corresponding closely to RW HT \u2212 K > 3.35 (AB magnitudes) or\nRW HT \u2212 K > 5 (Vega magnitudes). In Deep3a-F, 513 EROs\nwere selected to KVega < 20, and they are plotted in Fig. 5b\nwith solid red triangles, for a surface density of 1.6 arcmin\u22122.\nTo the same KVega < 20 limit, this agrees well with the density\nfound, e.g., in the K20 survey (\u223c 1.5 arcmin\u22122), or in the 180\narcmin2 survey by Georgakakis et al. (2005). In the Daddi-F,\n337 EROs were selected with the criterion RW HT \u2212 K > 3.35,\nconsistent with what done in Deep3a, and are plotted in\nFig. 5d as red solid triangles. The surface density of EROs\nin both fields at KVega < 18.4 can be compared, with overall\ngood consistency, to the one derived from the large 1 deg2\nsurvey by Brown et al. (2005).\nThe peak of the EROs redshift distribution is at z \u223c 1 (e.g.,\nCimatti et al. 2002a). By looking at the BzK properties of\nEROs we can estimate how many of them lie in the high-z tail\nz > 1.4, thus testing the shape of their redshift distribution.\nIn the Deep3a-F to KVega < 20 some 90 of the EROs are also\n\n\f6\n\nX. Kong et al.\n\nF IG . 3.- Differential K band galaxy counts from Deep3a-F and Daddi-F, compared with a compilation of results taken from various sources. [See the\nelectronic edition of the Journal for the color version of this figure.]\n\nsBzKs, thus likely belong to the category of dusty starburst\nEROs at z > 1.4, while 121 EROs are classified as pBzKs.\nTotally, \u223c 41% of EROs are selected with the BzK criteria,\nthus expected to lie in the high-z tail (z > 1.4) for KVega < 20\nsample. This result is consistent with the value of 35% found\nin the 52 arcmin2 of the K20 field (Daddi et al. 2004a), and\nwith the similar estimates of Moustakas et al. (2004) for the\nfull GOODS-South area. In the Daddi-F, to KVega < 19.2, 49\nof the EROs are also sBzKs; and 48 of them are also pBzKs.\nAbout 29% of EROs at KVega < 19.2 are in the high-z tail at\nz > 1.4.\n4.3. Number counts of EROs, sBzKs, and pBzKs\nSimple surface densities provide limited insight into the\nnature of different kind of galaxies. However, numbermagnitude relations, commonly called number counts, provide a statistical probe of both the space distribution of galaxies and its evolution. For this reason, we derived K-band\ndifferential number counts for EROs, sBzKs and pBzKs in\nour fields, and plotted them in Figure 6. The differential\nnumber counts in 0.5 mag bins are shown in Table 2. Also\nshown are the number counts for all K-selected field galaxies in Deep3a-F (circles with solid line) and Daddi-F (squares\nwith dot-dashed line), with the same as in Fig. 3 for comparison. A distinguishable characteristic in Fig. 6 is that all of\nhigh redshift galaxies (EROs, sBzKs, and pBzKs) have faint\n\n> 17 mag), and the slopes of\nNIR apparent magnitudes (KVega \u223c\nthe counts for EROs, sBzKs and pBzKs are steeper than that\nof the full K-selected sample.\nThe open squares with a solid line in Fig. 6 shows the number counts for sBzKs in Deep3a-F. The fraction of sBzKs in\nDeep3a-F increases very steeply towards fainter magnitudes.\nThe triangles with a solid line and crosses with a solid line\nshow, respectively, the number counts of EROs and pBzKs in\nDeep3a-F. The open squares with a dot-dashed line in Fig. 6\nshow the number counts for sBzKs in Daddi-F. The counts of\nsBzKs in Daddi-F are almost identical to those in Deep3a-F,\nto their limit of KVega \u223c 19. The triangles with a dot-dashed\nline and crosses with a dot-dashed line in Fig. 6 show respectively the number counts for EROs and pBzKs in Daddi-F.\nFor EROs, the slope of the number counts is variable, being steeper at bright magnitudes and flattening out toward\nfaint magnitudes. A break in the counts is present at KVega \u223c\n18.0, very similar to the break in the ERO number counts\nobserved by McCarthy et al. (2001) and Smith et al. (2002).\nThe pBzKs number counts have a similar shape, but the\nbreak in the counts slope is apparently shifted \u223c 1\u20131.5 mag\nfainter. There are indications that EROs and pBzKs have\nfairly narrow redshift distributions: peaked at z \u223c 1 for EROs\n(Cimatti et al. 2002b; Yan et al. 2004; Doherty et al. 2005) and\nat z \u2248 1.7 for pBzKs (Daddi et al. 2004b; 2005a).

In this section we estimate over the two fields\nthe angular correlation of the general galaxy population as\nwell as of the EROs, sBzKs and pBzKs.\nIn order to measure the angular correlation function of the\nvarious galaxy samples, we apply the Landy & Szalay technique (Landy & Szalay 1993; Kerscher et al. 2000), following the approach already described in Daddi et al. (2000), to\nwhich we refer for formulae and definitions.\n5.1. Clustering of the K-selected field galaxies\nIn our analysis a fixed slope \u03b4 = 0.8 was assumed for the\ntwo-point correlation function [w(\u03b8) = A \u00d7 10\u2212\u03b4 ].

The\ndiagonal solid line defines the region BzK \u2261 (z \u2212 K)AB \u2212 (B \u2212 z)AB \u2265 \u22120.2 that is efficient to isolate z > 1.4 star forming galaxies (sBzKs). The horizontal\ndot-dashed line further defines the region (z \u2212 K)AB > 2.5 that contains old galaxies at z > 1.4 (pBzKs). The dashed lines seperate regions occupied by stars and\ngalaxies. Filled stars show objects classified as stars, having (z \u2212 K)AB \u2212 0.3(B \u2212 z)AB < \u22120.5; open stars show stellar objects from the K20 survey (Daddi et al.\n2005a); squares represent sBzKs; circles represent pBzKs; triangles represent galaxies with (R \u2212 K)AB > 3.35 (EROs). Galaxies lying out of the BzK regions,\nthus likely having in general redshifts less than 1.4, are simply plotted as black points.\n\ncompare our results with the published ones that were obtained adopting the same slope (see Daddi et al. 2000 for more\ndetails).\nIn Figures 7 and 8 the bias-corrected two-point correlation functions w(\u03b8) of Daddi-F and Deep3a-F are shown as\nsquares; the bins have a constant logarithmic width (\u2206 log \u03b8 =\n0.1), with the bin centers ranging from 5.6\u2032\u2032 to 11.8\u2032 for both\nfields. These values of \u03b8 are large enough to avoid problems of under-counting caused by the crowding of galaxy\nisophotes and yet are much smaller than the extent of the individual fields. The dashed line shows the power-law correlation function given by a least square fit to the measured\ncorrelations. We clearly detect a positive correlation signal\nfor both fields with an angular dependence broadly consistent with the adopted slope \u03b4 = 0.8. The derived clustering amplitudes (where A is the amplitude of the true angular correlation at 1\u25e6 ) are presented in the third column of Table 3 and of Table 4 for Daddi-F and Deep3a-F, respectively,\nand shown in Fig. 9. We compare our result on Daddi-F\nwith those previously reported by Daddi et al. (2000), since\nwe use the same K-band images for this field. The present\nK-selected galaxy sample is however different from that of\nDaddi et al. (2000) in thta: (1) the area (600 arcmin2 ) is\nsmaller than that (701 arcmin2 ) in Daddi et al. (2000), because\n\nwe limit ours to the area with all the BRIzK-band data; and (2)\nthe star-galaxy separation was done by different methods. In\nDaddi et al. (2000) the SExtractor CLASS_STAR morphological parameter was used, while the photometric criterion of Daddi et al. (2004a) is used here. Column 10 of Table 3\nlists the clustering amplitudes of all the K-selected galaxies in\nDaddi et al. (2000). For KVega = 18.5 and fainter bins the Avalues in the two samples are in fair agreement, but for the\nbrightest bin (KVega = 18) the A-value in Daddi et al. (2000) is\n1.3 \u00d7 10\u22123, 45% smaller than that found here (2.36 \u00d7 10\u22123),\nprobably mainly due to the more efficient star-galaxy separation employed here (Sect. 3.1). Apart from this small discrepancy, we find good agreement between our results and those\nof Daddi et al. (2000) and Oliver et al. (2004).\nThe clustering amplitudes in Deep3a-F tend to be slightly\nbut systematically smaller than in Daddi-F, which is likely\ncaused by the intrinsic variance among different fields, depending on the survey geometry, surface density and clustering properties (see Sect. 5.5).\nWe find a smooth decline in amplitude with K-band\nmagnitude that is consistent with the results from Roche\net al. (2003), Fang et al. (2004), and Oliver et al. (2004). The\ndecline is not as steep as in the range 15 < KVega < 18 (see\ne.g. Roche et al. 1999).

Kong et al.\n\nto K \u223c 22\u201324 (Carlberg et al. 1997; Daddi et al. 2003) has\nbeen interpreted as due to the existence of strongly clustered\nK-selected galaxy populations extending to redshifts z \u223c 1\u2013\n3 (Daddi et al. 2003). Beside the well known z \u2248 1 EROs\nstrongly clustered galaxy populations, other populations with\nhigh angular clustering indeed exist with redshift extending to\nz \u2248 2.5 at least, as discussed in the next sections.\n5.2. Clustering of the EROs\nWe estimate the clustering properties of the EROs, using\nthe large sample of EROs derived from our two fields. Figures 10a) and 10b) clearly show, from both fields, that the sky\ndistribution of EROs is very inhomogeneous, as first noted by\nDaddi et al. (2000). The two-point correlation functions are\nshown in Fig. 7 and 8 for Daddi-F and Deep3a-F, and the dotdashed lines show the power-law correlation function given\nby a least squares fit to the measured values. The correlations\nare well fitted by a \u03b4 = 0.8 power law.\nA strong clustering of the EROs is indeed present at all\nscales that could be studied, and its amplitude is about one order of magnitude higher than that of the field population at the\nsame KVega limits, in agreement with previous findings (Daddi\net al. 2000; Firth et al. 2002; Brown et al. 2005; Georgakakis\net al. 2005). The derived clustering amplitudes are reported in\ncolumn (5) of Table 3 and Table 4 for Daddi-F and Deep3a-F,\nrespectively. The amplitudes shown in Fig. 9 suggest a trend\nof decreasing strength of the clustering for fainter EROs in\nboth fields.\nFor the KVega < 18.5 and 18.8 mag subsamples of Daddi-F,\nthe correlation function signal is significant at the 7 \u03c3 level\nwith clustering amplitudes A = 22.0 \u00d7 10\u22123 and 14.6 \u00d7 10\u22123,\nrespectively. For the subsample with KVega < 19.2 mag, the\ndetected signal is significant at the 10 \u03c3 confidence level\n(A = 13.2 \u00d7 10\u22123). In column 11 of Table 3 we also list the\nclustering amplitudes of EROs in Daddi et al. (2000), which\nare in good agreement with the present findings. Using a\n\u223c 180 arcmin2 Ks-band survey of a region within the Phoenix\nDeep Survey, Georgakakis et al. (2005) have analyzed a sample of 100 EROs brighter than KVega = 19 mag, and estimated\nan amplitude A = 11.7 \u00d7 10\u22123, consistent with our results.\nAs for the K-selected galaxies, the clustering amplitude of\nEROs in Deep3a-F is slightly smaller than that in Daddi-F.\nThe clustering amplitudes are A = 9.29 \u00d7 10\u22123 for KVega <\n18.8 EROs, and A = 4.25 \u00d7 10\u22123 for KVega < 20. EROs, which\nis weaker than the A = 8.7 \u00d7 10\u22123 for KVega < 20 EROs in\nGeorgakakis et al. (2005). Field-to-field variation is one of\npossible reasons for this discrepancy, which is discussed in\nSect. 5.5.\nWe notice that our results are solid against possible contamination by stars. Contamination by unclustered populations\n(i.e. stars) would reduce the amplitude of the angular correlation function by (1 \u2212 f )2 , where f is the fractional contamination of the sample. The prime candidates for contamination among EROs are red foreground Galactic stars (note that\nstars are not contaminating BzK samples), which can have\nred R \u2212 K colors. However, we have rejected stars among\nEROs using the photometric criterion for star-galaxy separations (see Sect. 3.1). Therefore, our clustering measurements\nrefer to extragalactic EROs only.\n5.3. Clustering of the star-forming BzKs\nFigures 10c) and 10d) display the sky distribution of the\nsBzKs in Daddi-F and Deep3a-F, and shows that also these\n\ngalaxies have a quite inhomogeneous distribution. This is not\nan artifact of variations of the detection limits over the fields,\nbecause the Monte Carlo simulations show that differences\nin detection completeness within small (4\u2032 .0 \u00d7 4\u2032 .0) areas in\nthe image are very small, and that the detection completeness\ndoes not correlate with the distribution of the sBzKs.\nThe resulting angular correlation functions for the sBzKs\nare shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 for the two fields. Again, a\nslope \u03b4 = 0.8 provides a good fit to the data. The best fit\nvalues of A are reported in column 7 of Table 3 and Table 4.\nThe w(\u03b8 = 1\u25e6 ) amplitudes of sBzKs in Daddi-F are 24.0 \u00d7\n10\u22123, 18.9 \u00d7 10\u22123 and 11.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 at KVega = 18.5, 18.8 and\n19.2, respectively. For sBzKs in Deep3a-F, the w(\u03b8) amplitudes become 29.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 , 6.70 \u00d7 10\u22123 and 4.95 \u00d7 10\u22123 at\nKVega = 18.8, 19.5 and 20.0, respectively. The sBzKs appear to be strongly clustered in both fields, and the clustering\nstrength increases with the K-band flux. Actually, they are\nas strongly clustered as the EROs. Strong clustering of the\nsBzKs was also inferred by Daddi et al. (2004b), by detecting\nsignificant redshift spikes in a sample of just nine KVega < 20\nsBzKs with spectroscopic redshifts in the range 1.7 < z <\n2.3. Albeit without spectroscopic redshifts, the present result is instead based on a sample of 500 sBzKs. Adelberger\net al. (2005) also found that UV-selected, star forming galaxies with KVega < 20.5 in the redshift range 1.8 \u2264 z \u2264 2.6 are\nstrongly clustered. Our results are in good agreement with\nthese previous findings.\n5.4. Clustering of the passive BzKs\nFigures 10e) and 10f) display the sky distribution of the\npBzKs in Daddi-F and Deep3a-F, and show that also these\ngalaxies have a very inhomogeneous distribution. We then\nderive the angular two-point correlation function of pBzKs,\nusing the same method as in the previous subsections.\nThe resulting angular correlation functions for the pBzKs\nare shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 for the two fields. Again, a\nslope \u03b4 = 0.8 provides a good fit to the data. The best fit\nvalues of A are reported in column (9) of Table 3 and Table 4.\nThe pBzKs appear to be the most strongly clustered galaxy\npopulation in both fields (with A = 22.9 \u00d7 10\u22123 for KVega <\n19.2 pBzKs in Daddi-F and A = 10.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 for KVega < 20.0\npBzKs in Deep3a-F), and the clustering strength increases\nwith increasing K-band flux.\n5.5. K-band dependence and field-to-field variations of\nclustering measurements\nFig. 9 summarizes the clustering measurements for the populations examined (field galaxies, EROs, and BzKs), as a\nfunction of the K-band limiting magnitudes of the samples.\nClear trends with K are present for all samples, showing that\nfainter galaxies have likely lower intrinsic (real space) clustering, consistent with the fact that objects with fainter K are\nless massive, or have wider redshift distributions, or both. For\nthe EROs (see Sect. 4.2) we have found evidence that faint\nKVega < 20 samples have indeed a higher proportion of galaxies in the z > 1.4 tail, with respect to brighter KVega < 19\nobjects, and thus a wider redshift distribution. As already\nnoted, all color-selected high-redshift populations are substantially more clustered than field galaxies, at all the magnitudes probed here. The reason for the stronger angular clustering of pBzKs, compared, e.g, to sBzKs or EROs, is likely (at\nleast in part) their narrower redshift distributions 1.4 < z < 2\n(Daddi et al. 2004a; 2005a).

The error bars on the direct estimator values are 1\u03c3 errors. To make this plot clear, we show the error bars of EROs and pBzKs only, the error\nbars of field galaxies are smaller, and the error bars of sBzKs are larger than those of EROs. The lines (dashed, dot-dashed, dotted, dash-dot-dotted) show the\npower-law fitted to the w(\u03b8).

There\nare in fact variations in our clustering measurements for high-\n\nredshift objects between the two fields, sometimes larger than\nexpected on the basis of the errors on each clustering measurements. We remind the reader that realistic external errors on the angular clustering of EROs, as well as sBzKs\nand pBzKs are likely larger than the Poissonian ones that we\nquote. Following the recipes by Daddi et al. (2001) we estimate that the typical total accuracy for our measurements of\nA \u2248 0.02, when including external variance, is on the order of\n\n\f12\n\nX.

Cosmic variance in the number counts\nThe presence of strong clustering will also produce substantial field to field variations in the number counts. Given the\navailable measurements of angular clustering, presented in the\nprevious sections, we are able to quantify the expected variance in the galaxies counts, following e.g. eq. (8) of Daddi\net al. (2000). We estimate that, for the Deep3a-F limit of\nKVega < 20, the integrated numbers of objects are measured\n\nto \u223c 20% precision for EROs and sBzKs, and to 30% precision for pBzKs.\n6.\n\nPROPERTIES OF S B Z K S\n\nThe accurate analysis of the physical properties of high\nredshift galaxies (such as SFR, stellar mass, etc.) requires\nthe knowledge of their spectroscopic redshift.

Tables 3 and 4 summarize the measurements together with their (Poisson) errors. [See the electronic edition of the Journal for the color version of this\nfigure.]\n\ntimates of these quantities can be derived on the basis of the\npresent photometric data, following the recipes calibrated in\nDaddi et al. (2004a), to which we refer for definitions and a\nmore detailed discussion of the recipes.\nWhile errors by a factor of 2 or more may affect individual\nestimates done in this way, when applied to whole population of BzK-selected galaxies these estimates should be relatively robust, on average, because the Daddi et al.'s (2004a)\nrelations were derived from a sample of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts. The estimates presented here thus represent a significant improvement on the similar ones provided\nby Daddi et al. (2004a) because of the 6 to 20 times larger area\nprobed (depending on magnitude) with respect to the K20 survey, which should help to significantly reduce the impact of\ncosmic variance.\n6.1. Reddening and star formation rates\nFollowing Daddi et al. (2004a), estimates of the reddening\nE(B \u2212 V ) and SFR for sBzKs can be obtained from the BzK\ncolors and fluxes alone (see Daddi et al. 2004a for more details). The reddening can be estimated by the B \u2212 z color, providing a measure of the UV slope. The Daddi et al. 's recipe is\nconsistent with the recipes by Meurer et al. (1999) and Kong\net al. (2004) for a Calzetti et al. (2000) extinction law, based\non the UV continuum slope. Daddi et al. (2004a) showed\n\nthat for BzK galaxies this method provides E(B \u2212 V ) with an\nrms dispersion of the residuals of about 0.06, if compared to\nvalues derived with knowledge of the redshifts, and with the\nuse of the full multicolor SED. With knowledge of reddening,\nthe reddening corrected B-band flux is used to estimate the\n1500\u00c5 rest-frame luminosity, assuming an average redshift of\n1.9, which can be translated into SFR on the basis, e.g., of\nthe Bruzual & Charlot (2003) models. Daddi et al. (2005b)\nshowed that SFRs derived in this way are consistent with radio and far-IR based estimates, for the average sBzKs.\nThe E(B \u2212V ) and SFR histograms of the sBzKs in Daddi-F\nand Deep3a-F are shown in Fig. 11. About 95% of the sBzKs\nin Daddi-F (KVega < 19.2) have SFR> 70 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , and the\nmedian SFR is about 370 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . About 90% of the sBzKs\nin Deep3a-F (KVega < 20.0) have SFR>70 M\u2299 yr\u22121, and the\nmedian SFR is \u223c 190 M\u2299 yr\u22121.\nThe median reddening for the KVega < 20 sBzKs is estimated to be E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.44, consistently with Daddi\net al. (2004a; 2005b). Of sBzKs 55% have E(B \u2212 V ) > 0.4,\nthe limit at which we estimate the UV-based criteria of Steidel et al. (2004) would fail at selecting z \u223c 2 galaxies.

(2005)\nexcluded from their sample the reddest sBzKs for which the\noptical magnitudes could not be accurately measured in their\ndata.\n6.2. Stellar masses of sBzKs and pBzKs\nUsing BC03 models, spectroscopic redshifts of individual\nK20 galaxies, and their whole UBV RIzJHK SED, Fontana\net al. (2004) have estimated the stellar-mass content for all the\nK20 galaxies (using a Salpeter IMF from 0.1 to 100 M\u2299 , as\nadopted in this paper). The individual mass estimates for 31\nnon-AGN sBzKs and pBzKs objects with z > 1.4 have been\nused by Daddi et al. (2004a) to calibrate an empirical relation\ngiving the stellar mass for both sBzKs and pBzKs as a function of their observed K-band total magnitude and z \u2212 K color.\nThis relation allows one to estimate the stellar mass with uncertainties on single objects of about 60% compared to the\nestimates based on knowledge of redshifts and using the full\nmulticolor SEDs. The relatively small variance is introduced\nby intrinsic differences in the luminosity distance, in the M/L\nratio for given magnitudes and/or colors.\nThe histograms for the stellar mass of the sBzKs derived in\nthis way are shown in Fig. 11e and Fig. 11f. About 95% of the\nsBzKs in Daddi-F have M\u2217 > 1011 M\u2299 , and the median stellar\nmass is 2.0 \u00d7 1011M\u2299 ; in Deep3a-F \u223c 40% of the sBzKs have\nM\u2217 > 1011 M\u2299 , the median stellar mass is \u223c 8.7 \u00d7 1010M\u2299 , a\ndifference due to the different limiting K magnitude in the two\nfields.\nUsing the same method, we also estimate the stellar mass\nof the pBzKs in both fields, and plot them in Fig. 11e and\nFig. 11f as the dotted line. The median stellar mass of pBzKs\nin Daddi-F is \u223c 2.5 \u00d7 1011M\u2299 , and in Deep3a-F is \u223c 1.6 \u00d7\n1011M\u2299 , respectively. Again, the higher masses for sBzKs\nin Daddi-F compared to Deep3a-F result from the shallower\nK-band limit.\nIt is worth noting that in the KVega < 20 sample there\nare barely any pBzKs less massive than 7 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 (see\nFig. 11f), while over 50% of sBzKs are less massive than\nthis limit. This is primarily a result of pBzKs being by construction redder than (z \u2212 K)AB = 2.5, and hence Eq. (6)\nand Eq. (7) in Daddi et al. (2004a) with KVega < 20 implies\n> 7 \u00d7 1010 M . Note that above 1011 M (above which\nM\u2217 \u223c\n\u2299\n\u2299\nour sample should be reasonably complete) the numbers of\nsBzKs and pBzKs are similar. We return to this point in the\nlast section.\n6.3. Correlation between physical quantities\nFigures 12a) and 12b) show the correlation between color\nexcess E(B \u2212 V ) and SFR for the sBzKs in Daddi-F and\nDeep3a-F, respectively. The Spearman rank correlation coefficients are rs = 0.40 for Daddi-F and rs = 0.57 for Deep3aF. This implies that the SFR is significantly correlated to\nE(B \u2212 V ), at a > 5 \u03c3 level, and the reddest galaxies have the\nhighest SFR. Part of this correlation can arise from simple\nerror propagation, as an overestimate (underestimate) of the\nreddening automatically leads to an overestimate (underestimate) of the SFR of a galaxy. In Fig. 12a) and Fig. 12b) the\narrow shows the resulting slope of the correlated reddening\nerrors, which indeed is parallel to the apparent correlation.\nHowever, the scatter in the original SFR-E(B \u2212V ) correlation\n[\u03b4E(B \u2212V ) \u223c 0.06; Daddi et al. 2004a] is much smaller than\nwhat needed to produce the full correlation seen in Fig. 12a)\nand 12b). We conclude that there is evidence for an intrinsic\n\n15\n\ncorrelation between SFR and reddening for z \u223c 2 star-forming\ngalaxies, with galaxies with higher star formation rates having\nmore dust obscuration. A positive correlation between SFR\nand reddening also exists in the local universe (see Fig. 1 of\nCalzetti 2004), and was also found by Adelberger & Steidel\n(2000) for z \u223c 3 LBGs, on a smaller range of reddening.\nIn Figures 12c) and 12d), we plot the relation between color\nexcess E(B \u2212 V ) and stellar mass of the sBzKs in Daddi-F\nand Deep3a-F. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient is\nrs = 0.53 for Daddi-F and rs = 0.63 for Deep3a-F, indicating that the correlation between E(B \u2212 V ) and stellar mass is\nsignificant at the > 7 \u03c3 level in both fields. In this case the estimate of the stellar mass depends only mildly on the assumed\nreddening, and therefore the correlation is likely to be intrinsic, with more massive galaxies being also more absorbed.\nGiven the previous two correlation, not surprisingly we\nalso find a correlation between SFR and stellar mass (Figure 12e and 12f). The Spearman rank correlation coefficient\nis rs = 0.30 for Daddi-F, and rs = 0.45 for Deep3a-F, indicating that the correlation between SFR and stellar mass is\nsignificant at the > 4 \u03c3 level in both fields. The origin of the\nsharp edge in Fig. 12e) and Fig. 12f) is caused by the color\nlimit BzK > \u22120.2 for selecting sBzKs. To show this clearly,\nwe plot galaxies with \u22120.2 < BzK < 0.0 as open squares in\nFig. 12f). However, no or very few z \u223c 2 galaxies exist below\nthe BzK > \u22120.2 line, and therefore the upper edge shown in\nthe figure appears to be intrinsic, showing a limit on the maximum SFR that is likely to be present in a galaxy of a given\nmass.\nAt z = 0 the vast majority of massive galaxies\n> 1011 M ) are passively evolving, \"red\" galaxies (e.g.,\n(M\u2217 \u223c\n\u2299\nBaldry et al. 2004), while instead at z \u223c 2, actively starforming (sBzKs) and passive (pBzKs) galaxies exist in similar\nnumbers, and Fig. 12 shows that the most massive sBzKs tend\nalso to be the most actively star forming. This can be seen\nas yet another manifestation of the downsizing effect (e.g.,\nCowie et al. 1996; Kodama et al. 2004; Treu et al. 2005), with\nmassive galaxies completing their star formation at an earlier\nepoch compared to less massive galaxies, which instead have\nmore prolonged star formation histories.\nBecause of the correlations discussed above, UV-selected\nsamples of z \u223c 2 galaxies (Steidel et al. 2004) will tend to\npreferentially miss the most star-forming and most massive\ngalaxies. Still, because of the large scattering in the correlations, some of the latter galaxies will also be selected in the\nUV, as can be seen in Fig. 12 and as emphasized in Shapley\net al. (2004; 2005).\n6.4. Mass and SFR densities\nIn this subsection we derive the contribution of the sBzKs\nto the integrated star formation rate density (SFRD) at z \u223c 2\nand of sBzKs and pBzKs to the stellar mass density at z \u223c 2.\nSome fraction of the sBzKs galaxies are known to be AGNdominated galaxies (Daddi et al. 2004b; 2005b; Reddy et al.\n2005). To estimate the AGN contamination, we have used the\n80 ks XMM-Newton X-ray data that are available for DaddiF (Brusa et al. 2005). A circular region of 11\u2032 radius from\nthe point of maximum exposure time include 70 sBzKs 18 of\nwhich are identified with X-ray sources using a 5\u2032\u2032 radius error\ncircle (see Fig. 12). This fraction is comparable to the one\nestimated in the CDFS field (Daddi et al. 2004b) and in the\nGOODS-N field (Daddi et al. 2005b; Reddy et al. 2005), for\nwhich > 1 Ms Chandra data are available. Based also on the\nlatter result, we assume the AGN contamination is about 25%,\n\n\f16\n\nX.

The filled area is the histogram for sBzKs in Daddi-F, which are associated with X-ray sources (about 25%). The dashed lines\nin (e) and (f) are the stellar mass histograms of pBzKs. [See the electronic edition of the Journal for the color version of this figure.]\n\nand we adopt this fraction to statistically correct properties\nderived from our sBzKs samples.\nThe left panel of Fig. 13 shows the differential contribution to the SFR density at z \u2243 2 from sBzKs as a function\nof their K-band magnitude. Using the volume in the redshift\n< z < 2.5 (Daddi et al. 2004a; see also Reddy et\nrange 1.4 \u223c\n\u223c\nal. 2005), an SFRD of 0.08 M\u2299 yr\u22121 Mpc\u22123 is derived from\nthe sBzKs (KVega < 20) in Deep3a-F, and an SFRD of 0.024\nM\u2299 yr\u22121 Mpc\u22123 is derived from the sBzKs (KVega < 19.2) in\nDaddi-F. These estimates are reduced, respectively, to 0.06\nM\u2299 yr\u22121 Mpc\u22123 (KVega < 20) and 0.018 M\u2299 yr\u22121 Mpc\u22123\n(KVega < 19.2) when subtracting an estimated 25% AGN contamination. Using the same method and the 24 sBzKs in\nthe K20/GOODS-S sample, Daddi et al. (2004a) derived an\nSFRD 0.044 \u00b1 0.008 M\u2299 yr\u22121 Mpc\u22123 for the volume in the\n< z < 2.5; i.e., \u223c 25% lower than that deredshift range 1.4 \u223c\n\u223c\nrived here, possibly due to cosmic variance. However, note\nthat there appears to be just a hint for the increasing trend in\nSFRD with K magnitude to flatten out at KVega \u223c 20, indicating that a substantial contribution to the total SFRD is likely\nto come from KVega > 20 sBzKs, and therefore the values derived here should be regarded as lower limits.\nRecently, Reddy et al. (2005) provided an estimate for the\n< 0.02 M yr\u22121 Mpc\u22123 , about\nSFRD of KVega < 20 sBzKs of \u223c\n\u2299\n\none-third of the estimate that we have obtained here. Part of\nthe difference is due to the absence of the reddest sBzKs from\nthe Reddy et al. (2005) sample, as already noticed. However,\nmost of the difference is likely due to the fact that the Reddy\net al. (2005) SFR estimate is based primarily on the X-ray\nemission interpreted with the Ranalli et al. (2003) relation.\nAs shown by Daddi et al. (2005b), the X-ray emission interpreted in this way typically underestimates the SFR of sBzKs\nby factors of 2\u20133, with respect to the radio-, mid-IR- and farIR-based SFR estimates, all of which are also in reasonable\nagreement with the UV-corrected SFR estimate.\nThe right panel of Fig. 13 shows the differential contribution to the stellar mass density \u03c1\u2217 at z \u2243 2 from sBzKs and\npBzKs as a function of their K-band magnitude. The open\nsquares and triangles represent values that were calculated\nfrom all sBzKs, the solid symbols represent values corrected\nfor the AGN contamination. The stars and crosses represent\nthe mass density contributed by pBzKs.\nThe stellar mass density in Deep3a-F, integrated to our\nKVega < 20 catalog limit, is log\u03c1\u2217 = 7.7 M\u2299 Mpc\u22123 , in excellent agreement with the value reported in Table 4 of Fontana\net al. (2004), i.e., log\u03c1\u2217 = 7.86 M\u2299 Mpc\u22123 for 1.5 \u2264 z < 2.0\ngalaxies, and log\u03c1\u2217 = 7.65 M\u2299 Mpc\u22123 for 2.0 \u2264 z < 2.5 galaxies, but now from a much bigger sample.

Kong et al.\n\nalso agree with the log\u03c1\u2217 \u223c 7.5 M\u2299 Mpc\u22123 estimate at z \u223c 2\nby Dickinson et al. (2003), although their selection is much\ndeeper (HAB < 26.5), although it extends over a much smaller\nfield (HDF). So, while our sample is likely to miss the contribution of low-mass galaxies, the Dickinson et al. sample is\nlikely to underestimate the contribution of high-mass galaxies\ndue to the small field and cosmic variance. There is little evidence for flattening of log\u03c1\u2217 by KVega = 20. As already noted,\nthe total stellar mass density at z \u223c 2 has to be significantly\nlarger than that estimated here, i.e., only from the contribution of KVega < 20 BzK-selected galaxies.\nThere are 121 pBzKs in Deep3a-F, and for \u223c 100 of\nthem we derive M\u2217 > 1011 M\u2299 . Correspondingly, the number density of pBzKs with M\u2217 > 1011 M\u2299 over the range\n< z < 2.0 is (1.8 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10\u22124 Mpc\u22123 (Poisson error\n1.4 \u223c\n\u223c\nonly). This compares to 3.4 \u00d7 10\u22124 Mpc\u22123 over the same\nredshift range as estimated by Daddi et al. (2005a) using six\nobjects in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) with spectroscopic redshift. While the Daddi et al. (2005a) HUDF sample\nis important to establish that most pBzKs are indeed passively\nevolving galaxies at 1.4 < z < 2.5, their density measurements\nis fairly uncertain due to cosmic variance. Being derived from\nan area which is \u223c 30 times larger than HUDF, the results\npresented here for the number density of massive, passively\nevolving galaxies in Deep3a-F in the quoted redshift range\nshould be much less prone to cosmic variance. Hence, we\nestimate that, compared to the local value at z \u223c 0 (9 \u00d7 10\u22124\nMpc\u22123 , Baldry et al. 2004), at 1.4 < z < 2 there appears to\nbe about 20%\u00b17% of massive (> 1011M\u2299 ), passively evolving galaxies, with the error above accounting also for cosmic\nvariance.\n7.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThis paper presents the results of a survey based on BRIzJK\nphotometry obtained by combining Subaru optical and ESO\nnear-IR data over two separate fields (Deep3a-F and DaddiF). Complete K-selected samples of galaxies were selected\nto KVega < 20 in the Deep3a-F over 320 arcmin2 , and to\nKVega \u223c 19 in the Daddi-F over a field roughly twice the area.\nDeep multicolor photometry in the BRIz bands were obtained\nfor the objects in both fields. Object catalogs constructed\nfrom these deep data contain more than 104 objects in the NIR\nbandpasses. Galaxy K-band number counts were derived and\nfound to be in excellent agreement with previous survey results.\nWe have used color criteria to select candidate massive galaxies at high redshift, such as BzK-selected starforming (sBzKs) and passively evolving (pBzKs) galaxies at\n< z < 2.5, and EROs, and derived their number counts.\n1.4 \u223c\n\u223c\nThe main results can be summarized as follows.\n1. Down to the K-band limit of the survey the log of the\nnumber counts of sBzKs increases linearly with the K magnitude, while that of pBzKs flattens out by KVega \u223c 19. Over\nthe Deep3a-F we select 387 sBzKs and 121 pBzKs down\nto KVega = 20, roughly a factor of 10 more than over the\n52 arcmin2 fields of the K20 survey. This corresponds to\na \u223c 30% higher surface density, quite possibly the result of\ncosmic variance. Over Daddi-F we select 108 sBzKs and 48\npBzKs down to KVega = 19.2.\n2. The clustering properties (angular two-point correlation\nfunction) of EROs and BzK-selected galaxies (both sBzKs and\npBzKs) are very similar, and their clustering amplitudes are\nabout a factor of 10 higher than those of generic galaxies in\nthe same magnitude range. The most strongly clustered pop-\n\nulations at each redshift are likely to be connected to each\nother in evolutionary terms, and therefore the strong clustering of EROs and BzKs makes quite plausible an evolutionary\nlink between BzKs at z \u223c 2 and EROs at z \u223c 1, with star formation in sBzKs subsiding by z \u223c 1 thus producing passively\nevolving EROs. While some pBzKs may well experience secondary, stochastic starbursts at lower redshift, the global evolutionary trend of the galaxy population is dominated by star\nformation being progressively quenched in massive galaxies,\nwith the quenching epoch of galaxies depending on environmental density, being earlier in high-density regions.\n3. Using approximate relations from Daddi et al. (2004a)\nand multicolor photometry, we estimated the color excess,\nSFR and stellar mass of sBzKs. These KVega < 20 galaxies have median reddening E(B \u2212 V ) \u223c 0.44, average SFR\u223c\n190 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , and typical stellar masses \u223c 1011 M\u2299 . Correlations between physical quantities are detected: the most massive galaxies are those with the largest SFRs and optical reddening E(B\u2212V ). The high SFRs and masses of these galaxies\nadd further support to the notion that these z \u2243 2 star-forming\ngalaxies are among the precursors of z \u2243 1 passive EROs and\nz \u2243 0 early-type galaxies.\n4. The contribution to the total star formation rate density\nat z \u223c 2 was estimated for the KVega < 20 sBzKs in our fields.\nThese vigorous starbursts produce an SFRD \u223c 0.06 M\u2299 yr\u22121\nMpc\u22123, which is already comparable to the global SFRD at\nz \u223c 2 as estimated from other surveys and simulations (e.g.\nSpringel & Hernqwist 2003; Heavens et al. 2004). However,\na sizable additional contribution is expected from KVega > 20\nsBzKs.\n5. In a similar fashion, the stellar mass of pBzKs was obtained, with the result that the number density of KVega < 20\npBzKs more massive than 1011 M\u2299 is about 20%\u00b17% of that\nof similarly massive, early-type galaxies at z = 0, indicating that additional activity and subsequent quenching of star> 1011 M star-forming galaxies must account\nformation in \u223c\n\u2299\nfor increasing the number of massive passive galaxies by\na factor of about 5 from z = 1.7. The number density of\n11\n>\n\u223c 10 M\u2299 sBzKs is similar to that of pBzKs. Given their\nstrong star-formation activity, it seems that by z \u223c 1\u20131.4 the\n> 1011 M passive galaxies could be\nfull population of local \u223c\n\u2299\neventually assembled as a result.\nThis result, advocated also in Daddi et al. (2005b), may\nappear in contradiction with the recent finding by Bell et al.\n(2004) of a factor of 2 decrease in the number density of earlytype galaxies at z \u223c 1, with respect to the local value (see\nalso Faber et al. 2005). However, our analysis of the Bell\net al (2004) results shows that most of this evolution is to be\nascribed to the progressive disappearence with increasing redshift of the fainter galaxies, while the population of the brightest, most massive galaxies being substantially stable. This\nwould be, in fact, another manifestation of the downsizing effect. A future publication will address this point in its full\ndetails and implications.\nMapping the metamorphosis of active star-forming galaxies into passively evolving, early-type galaxies from high to\nlow redshifts, and as a function of galaxy mass and environment is one of the primary goals of the main ongoing galaxy\nsurveys. Using Subaru and VLT telescopes, optical and nearinfrared spectra are being obtained, with targets from the\npresent database having been selected according to the same\ncriteria adopted in this paper. Future papers in this series will\npresent further scientific results from this pilot survey, along\n\n\fSurvey for High-Redshift Massive Galaxies I.\nwith a variety of data products.\nWe thank the anonymous referee for useful and constructive comments that resulted in a significant improvement of\nthis paper.
