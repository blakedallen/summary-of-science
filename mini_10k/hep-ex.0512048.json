It was shown some time ago that CP V is a\nnecessary but insufficient constraint in order to generate a net baryon anti-baryon asymmetry in the universe [2]. In\nthe ensuing years there has been a tremendous amount of activity by the high energy physics community to better\nunderstand the role of CP V in our model of nature \u2212 the Standard Model of Particle Physics (SM).\nCP V in the SM is described by a single complex phase in a 3 \u00d7 3 quark-mixing matrix, VCKM , called the CKM [3]\nmatrix:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nVud Vus Vub\n(1)\nVCKM = \uf8ed Vcd Vcs Vcb \uf8f8 .\nVtd Vts Vtb\nVCKM describes the coupling of the u, c and t quarks to d, s and b quarks, which is mediated by the exchange of a\nW boson. In B-meson decays the interesting CP violating parameters of the SM are related to the angles (\u03b2, \u03b1, and\n\u03b3)1 and sides of the so-called Unitarity Triangle (as shown in Figure 1). The angles are defined as:\n\u22c6\n\u03b1 \u2261 arg [\u2212Vtd Vtb\u22c6 /Vud Vub\n],\n\u22c6\n\u03b2 \u2261 arg [\u2212Vcd Vcb /Vtd Vtb\u22c6 ] ,\n\u22c6\n\u03b3 \u2261 arg [\u2212Vud Vub\n/Vcd Vcb\u22c6 ] .\n\n(\u03c1,\u03b7)\n\u03b1\n\n*\nVud Vub\nVcd Vcb*\n\n\u03b3\n\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n\nVtd Vtb*\nVcd Vcb*\n\u03b2\n\n(0,0)\n\n(1,0)\nFIG. 1: The Unitarity Triangle.\n\nThis review is a summary of the experimental constraints on the Unitarity Triangle angle \u03b1 obtained from B-meson\ndecays involving b \u2192 u transitions. The CKM angle \u03b2 is well known and consistent with SM predictions [4]. Any\n\n1\n\nThe Belle Collaboration use the notation \u03c61 , \u03c62 , and \u03c63 for the angles of the Unitarity Triangle.\n\n\f2\nconstraint on \u03b1 constitutes a test of the SM description of quark mixing and CP V in B-meson decays. A significant\ndeviation from SM expectation would be a clear indication of new physics. It is possible to obtain a SM prediction\nof \u03b1 from indirect constraints by combining measurements of the CKM matrix elements |Vus |, |Vud |, |Vub |, and |Vcb |,\nCPV in mixing from neutral kaons, B-B mixing in Bd and Bs mesons and the measurement of sin 2\u03b2 from b \u2192 ccs\n\u25e6\ndecays. The SM predictions for \u03b1 are (98.2 \u00b1 7.7)\u25e6 from [5] and (97+13\n\u221219 ) [6].\nMeasurements of \u03b1 have recently been performed at the B-factories, the BABAR experiment [7] at SLAC and the Belle\nexperiment [8] at KEK. The B-factories study the decays of B-mesons produced in the process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03a5 (4S) \u2192 BB,\n0\nwhere BB is either B + B \u2212 or B 0 B . The neutral B-mesons are produced in a correlated P-wave state. Until one\nof the B-mesons in an event decays, there is exactly one B 0 and one B 0 meson. The main goals of the B-factories\ninclude the study of CP V in B-meson decay, and to over-constrain the position of the apex of the Unitarity Triangle\n(\u03c1, \u03b7). The final states of interest for the study of \u03b1 are B \u2192 hh\u2032 , where h = \u03c1, \u03c0. Figure 2 shows the Feynman\ndiagrams corresponding to the dominant amplitudes contributing to the h+ h\u2032\u2212 decays.\n+\n\nu\n+\n\nW\n0\n\nd\n\nb\n\nu\n\nd\n\nd\n\nB\n\nW\n\nb\n\u03c0,\u03c1\n+\n\nu, c, t\n\n+\n\ng\n\n0\n\nB\n\u2212\n\nu\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c0,\u03c1\n\nd + +\n\u03c0,\u03c1\nu\n\nd\n\nd\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c0,\u03c1\n\nFIG. 2: The tree (left) and gluonic loop (right) contributions to B \u2192 h+ h\u2032\u2212 decays.\n\nInterference between the amplitude for direct decay, and decay after B 0 -B 0 mixing to a h+ h\u2032\u2212 final state, results in\na time-dependent decay-rate asymmetry between B 0 and B 0 decays that is sensitive to the CKM angle \u03b1. To study\nthe time-dependent asymmetry with neutral B-mesons, one needs to measure the proper time difference \u2206t between\nthe decay of the two B-mesons in the event. On reconstructing the h+ h\u2032\u2212 final state of interest (Brec ), one needs to\ndetermine the flavor of the other B-meson (Btag )2 from its decay products. The time difference between the decays of\nthe two neutral B-mesons in the event (Brec , Btag ) is calculated from the measured separation \u2206z between the Brec\nand Btag decay vertices. The Brec decay vertex is determined from the two charged-pion tracks in its final state. The\nBtag decay vertex is obtained by fitting the other tracks in the event.\nThe signal decay-rate distribution of a CP -eigenstate decay, f+ (f\u2212 ) for Btag = B 0 (B 0 ), is given by:\nf\u00b1 (\u2206t) =\n\ne\u2212|\u2206t|/\u03c4\n[1 \u00b1 S sin(\u2206md \u2206t) \u2213 C cos(\u2206md \u2206t)] ,\n4\u03c4\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03c4 = 1.536 \u00b1 0.014 ps is the mean B 0 lifetime and \u2206md = 0.502 \u00b1 0.007 ps\u22121 is the B 0 -B 0 mixing frequency [9].\nThis assumes that there is no difference between B 0 lifetimes, \u2206\u0393 = 0. The parameters S and C are defined as:\nS=\n\n2Im\u03bb\n,\n1 + |\u03bb|2\n\nC=\n\n1 \u2212 |\u03bb|2\n,\n1 + |\u03bb|2\n\n(6)\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\nwhere \u03bb = pq A\nA is related to the level of B -B mixing (q/p), and the ratio of amplitudes of the decay of a B or B\nto the final state under study (A/A). CP V is probed by studying the time-dependent decay-rate asymmetry\n\nA=\n\nR(\u2206t) \u2212 R(\u2206t)\n,\nR(\u2206t) + R(\u2206t)\n\n(7)\n\nwhere R(R) is the decay-rate for B 0 (B 0 ) tagged events. This asymmetry has the form\nA = S sin(\u2206md \u2206t) \u2212 C cos(\u2206md \u2206t).\nBelle use a different convention to BABAR with C = \u2212ACP .\n\n2\n\ni.e. determine if Btag is a B 0 or B 0 .\n\n(8)\n\n\f3\nIn this article, all results are quoted using the S and C convention. In the case of charged B-meson decays (and\n\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 as there is no vertex information) one can study a time integrated charge asymmetry\nACP =\n\nN \u2212N\n,\nN +N\n\n(9)\n\nwhere N (N ) is the number of B (B) decays to the final state. A non-zero measurement of S, C or ACP for any of\nthe decays under study would be a clear indication of CP V .\nIn the absence of loop (penguin) contributions in B 0 decays to the CP eigenstate h+ h\u2212 , S = sin 2\u03b1, and C = 0.\nThe presence of penguin contributions with different weak phases to the tree level amplitude shift the experimentally\nmeasurable parameter \u03b1eff away from the value of \u03b1. In the presence of penguin contributions \u03b1eff = \u03b1 + \u03b4\u03b1(penguin),\nS = sin 2\u03b1eff , and C can be non zero.\nFor B 0 decays to \u03c1+ \u03c1\u2212 , S= SL or ST and C= CL or CT are the CP asymmetry parameters for the longitudinal\nand transversely polarized signal, respectively. The decay-rate distribution for B 0 decays to the \u03c1\u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 final state is\nmore complicated than the above description as \u03c1\u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 is not a CP eigenstate (discussed below).\nThere are two classes of measurement that the B-factories are pursuing. The main goal is to use SU (2) isospin\nrelations to relate different hh\u2032 final states and limit \u03b4\u03b1(penguin) in each of the modes B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , B 0 \u2192 \u03c1\u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 and\nB 0 \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03c1\u2212 . In some cases only weak constraints on \u03b1 are obtained when using SU (2) relations and one must use a\nmodel dependent approach to obtain a significant result.\nThe remainder of this article describes the isospin analysis used to constrain \u03b4\u03b1(penguin), and experimental techniques. There is a discussion of the results at the end of the article. Throughout this article, the experimental results\nare quoted with statistical errors preceding systematic errors unless otherwise stated.\nII.\n\nISOSPIN ANALYSIS OF B \u2192 hh\u2032\n\nOne can use SU (2) isospin to relate the amplitudes of B decays to \u03c0\u03c0 final states [10]. This results in two relations:\n1\n\u221a A+\u2212 = A+0 \u2212 A00 ,\n2\n1 +\u2212\n\u22120\n00\n\u221a A\n=A \u2212A ,\n2\n\n(10)\n(11)\n\nij\n\nwhere Aij (A ) are the amplitudes of B (B) decays to the final state with charge ij. These two relations correspond\nto triangles in a complex plane as shown in Figure 3.\n\n00\n\n1 +\u2212\n2\n\nA\n\nA\n\n~ 00\n\nA\n\n1 ~+\u2212\n2\n\nA\n\n+0\n\nA ,\n\n~ \u22120\n\nA\n\nFIG. 3: The isospin triangle for B \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 decays.\n\nThis approach only considers tree and gluonic penguin contributions. Possible contributions from electroweak\npenguins (EWP) are ignored as they do not obey SU (2) isospin symmetry. EWPs have the same topology as the\ngluonic penguin diagram in Figure 2, with the gluon replaced by \u03b3 or Z 0 bosons. In the absence of EWP contributions\n+0\n+0\n|A+0 | = |A |, i.e. ACP = 0 for B + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 . After aligning A+0 and A , the phase difference between A+\u2212 and\n+\u2212\nA\nis 2\u03b4\u03b1(penguin). In order to measure \u03b1 one must measure the branching fractions (B) and charge asymmetries\n(ACP , or C) of B decays to \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 0 , \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 .\n\n\f4\nThe decays B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1 are more complicated; one has an isospin triangle relation for each of the three amplitudes in\nthe final state, one corresponding to the CP even longitudinal polarization and two corresponding to the CP even,\nand CP odd parts of the transverse polarization. The \u03c1\u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 final state is not a CP eigenstate. This results in the\nneed for a pentagon isospin analysis [11] or a Dalitz Plot (DP) analysis of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 final state [12] to measure \u03b1.\nThere are several assumptions implicitly used in the isospin-based direct measurements of \u03b1. The assumptions\ncommon to all decay modes are (i) to neglect EWP contributions and (ii) to neglect other SU (2) symmetry breaking\neffects. In addition to this, possible I=1 amplitudes [13] in B 0 \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03c1\u2212 decays are ignored. Several groups have\nestimated the correction due to the SU (2) breaking effect of EWP contributions to be O(1.5 \u2212 2)\u25e6 [14, 15]. These\nestimates consider contributions from the two EWP operators assumed to be dominant in the effective Hamiltonian.\nSome estimates of other expected SU (2) symmetry breaking effects exist, where any correction is estimated to be\nmuch less than the current experimental precision [16].\nIII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES\n\nContinuum e+ e\u2212 \u2192 qq (q = u, d, s, c) events are the dominant background to B \u2192 hh\u2032 decays. Signal Brec\ncandidates are identified\nusing two kinematic variables: the difference between the energy of the B candidate and\n\u221a\nthe\nbeam\nenergy\ns/2\nin\nthe center of mass (CM) frame \u2206E; and the beam-energy substituted mass mES =\np\n\u221a\n(s/2 + pi * pB )2 /Ei2 \u2212 p2B . As the B-factories collect data at the \u03a5 (4S) resonance s = 10.58 GeV. The B\nmomentum pB and four-momentum of the initial state (Ei , pi ) are defined in the laboratory frame. Event shape\nvariables are used to further discriminate between signal and continuum background [17].\nThe flavor of Btag is determined from its final state particles. Both BABAR and Belle characterize the final state\nparticles of Btag into events where there are leptons, kaons and \u03c0-mesons. The charge of these reconstructed tracks\nin the final state indicate if Btag is a B 0 or a B 0 . The signal purity varies depending on the momentum and type of\ntracks in the final state. Events with leptons in the final state are the cleanest and those with charged kaons in the\nfinal state have less background than those with \u03c0-mesons. In addition to this, the probability of assigning the wrong\nflavor to Btag increases as the background increases. BABAR separates events into mutually exclusive categories of\nevents, whereas the Belle combines this information into a single variable r, and tunes event selection in bins of r.\nThe two approaches are equivalent and are described in more detail in the following references [18, 19].\nThe \u2206t distributions of Equations 5 and 13 are convoluted with a detector resolution description, which differs for\nsignal and continuum background [19, 20], and also take into account dilution from incorrectly assigning the flavor\nof Btag . The signal and background parameters are extracted using an extended unbinned maximum-likelihood fit to\nthe data for the analyses described here.\nIV.\nA.\n\nRESULTS\nB \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\n\nThe simplest decays to study in the pursuit of \u03b1 are B \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0. Both experiments have measured B \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , \u03c0 + \u03c0 0\nand \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 decays [21, 22]. The results are summarized in the Table below. The BABAR measurements use a data\nsample of 210f b\u22121, the Belle \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 result use 78f b\u22121, and the other Belle results use 253f b\u22121 of integrated luminosity.\nAll of these modes are now well established experimentally and so it is possible to perform an isospin analysis. The\ncharge asymmetry measurement of B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 accounts for the effect of B 0 -B 0 mixing.\nmode Expt.\nB (\u00d710\u22126 )\nS\nC\n+ \u2212\n\u03c0 \u03c0 BABAR 5.5 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b1 0.3 \u22120.30 \u00b1 0.17 \u00b1 0.03 \u22120.09 \u00b1 0.15 \u00b1 0.04\nBelle 4.4 \u00b1 0.6 \u00b1 0.3 \u22120.67 \u00b1 0.16 \u00b1 0.06 \u22120.56 \u00b1 0.12 \u00b1 0.06\nmode Expt.\nB (\u00d710\u22126 )\n\u00b1 0\n\u03c0 \u03c0 BABAR 5.8 \u00b1 0.6 \u00b1 0.4\nBelle\n5.0 \u00b1 1.2 \u00b1 0.5\n\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 BABAR 1.17 \u00b1 0.32 \u00b1 0.10\n+0.2\nBelle\n2.3+0.4\n\u22120.5 \u22120.3\n\nACP\n\u22120.01 \u00b1 0.10 \u00b1 0.02\n\u22120.02 \u00b1 0.10 \u00b1 0.01\n\u22120.12 \u00b1 0.56 \u00b1 0.06\n\u22120.44+0.53\n\u22120.52 \u00b1 0.17\n\nOne should note that the Belle measurement of B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 constitutes an observation of CP V in this decay at\na level of 5.4\u03c3, and evidence for direct CP V at a level of 4.0\u03c3. This is the second observation of CP V in B-meson\n\n\f5\ndecays, the first being the measurement of a non-zero value for sin 2\u03b2 from b \u2192 ccs decays [4]. The BABAR data\nare consistent with the hypothesis of no CP V in this decay. In recent years the two sets of results have started to\nconverge to a common value, but more statistics are required to resolve the controversy.\nThe \u03c0\u03c0 isospin analysis is limited by the value of B(B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ). Unfortunately this branching fraction is neither large enough to provide sufficient statistics with the current data set to perform a precision measurement of\n\u03b4\u03b1(penguin), nor small enough to enable a strong bound on this quantity. BABAR have performed an isospin analysis\nresulting in |\u03b4\u03b1(penguin)| < 35\u25e6 (90% C.L.). Belle's data exclude values of \u03b1 between 19 and 72\u25e6 (95.4% C.L.), and\nconstrain |\u03b4\u03b1(penguin)| < 38\u25e6 (95.4% C.L.) [23]. One requires a significant increase in statistics to perform a precision\nmeasurement of \u03b1 using B \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 decays. However, it is possible to extract a model dependent constraint on \u03b1 from\nthe current results assuming SU (3) symmetry (i.e. exchanging u and s quarks), Gronau and Rosner obtain a value\nof \u03b1 = (107 \u00b1 13)\u25e6 [24].\nB.\n\nB \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1\n\nThe decay B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1 is that of a spin zero particle decaying into two spin one particles (as shown in Figure 4). As a\nresult, the CP analysis of B decays to \u03c1+ \u03c1\u2212 is complicated by the presence of three helicity states (H = 0, \u00b11). The\nH = 0 state corresponds to longitudinal polarization and is CP -even, while neither the H = +1 nor the H = \u22121 state\nis an eigenstate of CP . The longitudinal polarization fraction fL is defined as the fraction of the helicity zero state in\nthe decay. The angular distribution is\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd2 \u0393\n1\n9\n2\n2\n2\n2\nfL cos \u03b81 cos \u03b82 + (1 \u2212 fL ) sin \u03b81 sin \u03b82\n(12)\n=\n\u0393d cos \u03b81 d cos \u03b82\n4\n4\nwhere \u03b8i (i = 1, 2) is defined for each \u03c1-meson as the angle between the \u03c0 0 momentum in the \u03c1 rest frame and the\nflight direction of the B 0 in this frame. The angle \u03c6 between the \u03c1-decay planes is integrated over to simplify the\nanalysis. A full angular analysis of the decays is needed in order to separate the definite CP contributions of the\ntransverse polarization; if however a single CP channel dominates the decay (which has been experimentally verified),\nthis is not necessary [25].\n\n3\n\u03b8\n\u03c6\n\n1\n\n\u03b8\n\nV\n\n2\n\n2\n\n4\n\nV\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\nFIG. 4: A schematic diagram of the decay of a B-meson via two vector particles, V1 and V2 , into a four-particle final state.\n\nThe longitudinal polarization dominates this decay [26, 27]. Not all of the \u03c1\u03c1 final states have been observed,\nhowever as B(B 0 \u2192 \u03c10 \u03c10 ) is small, one can conservatively assume that it is longitudinally polarized when performing\nan isospin analysis.

Recent measurements of the B + \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03c10 branching fraction and upper limit\nfor B 0 \u2192 \u03c10 \u03c10 [28] indicate small penguin contributions in B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1, as predicted by some calculations [29]. The\nultimate uncertainty on \u03b1 from B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1 will depend on the branching fraction and CP content of B 0 \u2192 \u03c10 \u03c10 . The\ndecay B 0 \u2192 \u03c10 \u03c10 has an all charged track final state and it is possible to measure both S and C for the different\nCP -eigenstate components of the decay, unlike B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 decays where one can only measure C.\nGiven that penguin pollution is small, it is possible to perform an isospin analysis of the longitudinal polarization\nof the B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1 decays, and use the results of BABAR's time-dependent CP analysis of \u03c1+ \u03c1\u2212 [27] to constrain \u03b1. If\none does this, using the aforementioned assumptions, one obtains \u03b1 = (100 \u00b1 13)\u25e6 using BABAR data [30]. The error\non \u03b1 is dominated by |\u03b4\u03b1(penguin)| < 11\u25e6 (68% C.L.). Belle have recently produced a preliminary measurement of\nthe polarization, branching fraction and CP parameters of B 0 \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03c1\u2212 [31]. The Belle constraint is \u03b1 = (87 \u00b1 17)\u25e6 ,\nwhich is slightly weaker than the BABAR result. Both \u03c1\u03c1 isospin analyses use the same experimental information for\nthe decays B 0 \u2192 \u03c10 \u03c10 , and B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c1\u00b1 \u03c10 . Figure 5 shows the (1-C.L.) plot of \u03b1 corresponding to the isospin analysis\nof the longitudinally polarized \u03c1\u03c1 data [6]. There is also a non-SM solution for \u03b1 near 175\u25e6 .\nOur knowledge of \u03b4\u03b1(penguin) is primarily determined from the experimental knowledge of the \u03c10 \u03c10 and \u03c1\u00b1 \u03c10\nbranching ratios. As in the case of B \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0, our knowledge on \u03b1 is limited by the penguin contribution. However,\nfor B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1 decays \u03b4\u03b1(penguin) is sufficiently small to allow the B-factories to perform a meaningful measurement.\n\nB \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1 (WA)\n0\n+ \u2013\nWA & B \u2192 \u03c1 \u03c1 (BABAR)\n+ \u2013\nWA & S/Clong(\u03c1 \u03c1 ) (Belle)\n\nCK M\n\n1.2\n\nfitter\nEPS 2005\n\n1 \u2013 C.L.\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n\nCKM fit\n\nno \u03b1 meas. in fit\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n\u03b1 (deg)\n\nFIG. 5: A plot of (1 - C.L.) of \u03b1 determined from the BABAR (dashed) and Belle (dotted) \u03c1\u03c1 isospin analyses [6]. The shaded\nregion corresponds to the constraint obtained from the average of the two experiments. The point with error bars corresponds\nto the 1\u03c3 interval (68 % C.L.) obtained from the CKM fit when excluding direct measurements of \u03b1.\n\nThe \u03c1\u03c1 isospin triangle does not close when taking into account the measurements of the B-factories. Both the\nCKM Fitter and UTfit groups have noted that SU (2) symmetry constraints prefer a smaller branching fraction for\n\n\f7\nthe B + \u2192 \u03c1+ \u03c10 decay, at the level of 1.5 \u2212 2\u03c3. The measurements did not test for possible non-resonant backgrounds,\nS-wave \u03c0\u03c0 contributions under the \u03c10 , or account for exclusive B backgrounds to decays excluding charm particles.\nIt is important to see that this decay mode is studied in more detail with higher statistics in the future.\nC.\n\nB \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0\n\nThe decays B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0 can be analysed in two different ways. The more straightforward approach is to cut away\ninterference regions of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 DP and analyze the regions in the vicinity of the \u03c1 resonances. This is the so-called\nQuasi-2-body approach (Q2B) and it avoids the need to understand the interference regions. The drawbacks of the\nQ2B method are that one looses a lot of statistical power by cutting on the DP, and that interference is unaccounted\nfor. A corollary of this is that one requires more statistics than the B-factories currently have in order to obtain a\nsignificant constraint from the pentagon isospin analysis of B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0. The alternative is to perform an analysis of\nthe B \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 DP, accounting for the interference between intersecting \u03c1 resonance bands and other resonant\nstructures. The Q2B approach has been studied by BABAR and Belle [32, 33], and the first time-dependent DP\nanalysis has been performed by BABAR [34].\nIn the Q2B approach, one fits a time-dependence of\nf\u00b1 (\u2206t) = (1 \u00b1 ACP )\n\ne\u2212|\u2206t|/\u03c4\n[(S \u00b1 \u2206S sin(\u2206md \u2206t) \u2212 (C \u00b1 \u2206C) cos(\u2206md \u2206t)] ,\n4\u03c4\n(13)\n\nwhere there are three additional parameters in comparison with Equation 5. These parameters are a charged asymmetry, ACP , between decays to \u03c1+ \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c1\u2212 \u03c0 + final states, and two dilution parameters; \u2206S and \u2206C. The details of\nthe DP analysis can be found in [34], where one varies a larger number of parameters in the nominal fit, and converts\nthese to the same observables as the Q2B approach. The Table below summarizes the experimental constraints on\nB \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0 (DP analysis from BABAR and Q2B analysis from Belle). The branching fractions measured for this decay\n+2.8\n\u22126\nare (22.6 \u00b1 1.8 \u00b1 2.2) \u00d7 10\u22126 and (20.8+6.0\nby BABAR and Belle, respectively [35].

Figure 6 shows the corresponding\n(1 - C.L.) plot for \u03b1. This result is self-consistent as the strong phase differences and amplitudes are determined solely\nfrom the structure of the DP. The unique aspect of this result is that there is only a single solution between 0 and\n180\u25e6 , and thus a two fold ambiguity on \u03b1. As a result this measurement is an important constraint on \u03b1, ancillary to\nthat from B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1.\nIt is possible to derive a model dependent constraint on \u03b1 from these data as shown by Gronau and Zupan [36].\nOne can make several assumptions, including (i) the relative strong phase differences between tree level contributions\nfor \u03c1+ \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c1\u2212 \u03c0 + being less than 90\u25e6 (ii) SU (3) being exact for penguin amplitudes (iii) neglecting EWP (iv)\nneglecting annihilation and exchange diagrams to derive a constraint on \u03b1. SU (3) breaking effects are estimated in\nthis model using CLEO, BABAR and Belle data. When doing this Belle obtains \u03b1 = (102 \u00b1 11expt \u00b1 15model )\u25e6 . Gronau\nand Zupan compute the corresponding result for the BABAR analysis as (93 \u00b1 4expt \u00b1 15model )\u25e6 . There are other\nmodels proposed in the literature, for example [37].\n\nV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\n\u25e6\nThe indirect measurements of \u03b1 from the SM are (98.2 \u00b1 7.7)\u25e6 [5] and (97+13\n\u221219 ) [6] from the UTfit and CKM Fitter\ngroups, respectively. Direct measurements from the B-factories are in good agreement with these predictions, where\nthe uncertainty on \u03b1 from B \u2192 hh\u2032 decays is known to O(9\u25e6 ). The precision of this result is dominated by an\nisospin analysis of B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1 decays, with an important contribution from B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0 as the latter result suppresses a\nsecond solution for \u03b1 near 175\u25e6 . This solution is disfavored at the 1.3\u03c3 level by studies of B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 decays.\nThe B-factory constraints on \u03b1 will be improved as additional data are analyzed over the next few years, and these\nmeasurements will start to test the closure of Unitarity Triangle with precision.

The measurement of \u03b1 from B \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 remains a vital part\nof the program, as theoretical uncertainties in the extraction of \u03b1 (other than the determination of \u03b4\u03b1(penguin)) are\nthe best understood of all the channels that have been discussed here.\nSimilarly, the model dependent calculations on \u03b1 are in agreement with the SM. The constraints from B \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\nand \u03c1\u03c0 decays have a precision of 13\u25e6 and 15.5\u25e6 , respectively. These constraints are dominated by theoretical\nuncertainties. The precision on the model dependent constraints obtained are comparable with the isospin analysis\nresult from B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1.\nThe measurement of \u03b1 using B \u2192 a1 \u03c0 decays was proposed some time ago [38]. The recent observation of\n\u2212\n\u22126\nB 0 \u2192 a+\n) [39] raises the question of how well one can ultimately measure\n1 \u03c0 with a branching fraction O(45 \u00d7 10\n\u03b1 using this decay mode. The use of SU (3) to measure \u03b1 with B \u2192 a1 \u03c0 decays has recently been proposed [40].\nStudies of the LHCb experiment's [41] sensitivity to \u03b1 using B \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 decays have been performed [42]. LHCb\nis expected to achieve a 10\u25e6 precision on \u03b1 within the first year of data taking. The physics reach of decays involving\n\u2212\nshould also\nb \u2192 u transitions with all charged particles in the final states, such as B 0 \u2192 \u03c10 \u03c10 and B 0 \u2192 a+\n1\u03c0\nbe investigated. The current B-factories will reach a precision of 7 \u2212 10\u25e6 on \u03b1 with 1 ab\u22121 of data using B \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1\ndecays. The ultimate precision reached depends on the values of the branching fraction, fL , S and C in B 0 \u2192 \u03c10 \u03c10 .\nSensitivity projections for the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 DP analysis are very dependent on the many input parameters involved. For\nthis reason, the running experiments have not extrapolated the precision of \u03b1 obtained from \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 decays to higher\nluminosities.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work is supported in part by the UK Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (PPARC), and the\nU.S. Department of Energy under contract number DE-AC02-76SF00515.
