In low-scale gravity the neutrino mass matrix in the flavor\nbasis is characterized by one parameter (the gravity scale MX ) and by an exact or approximate flavor\nblindness (namely, all elements of the mass matrix are of comparable size). Neutrino masses and mixings\nare consistent with the observational data for certain values of the matrix elements, but only when the\nspectrum of mass is inverted or degenerate. For the latter type of spectra the parameter Mee probed in\ndouble beta experiments and the mass parameter probed by cosmology are close to existing upper limits.\n\n1\n\nMotivations and context\n\nThe see-saw mechanism [1] remains most attractive one for generation of neutrino masses. The neutrino\nmasses induced by quantum gravity are widely discussed, too [2, 3, 4, 5], but the absolute value of neutrino\nmass m\u03bd \u223c v 2 /MPl \u223c 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22126 eV, where v = 174 GeV is electroweak vacuum expectation value and\nMPl = 1.2 \u00d7 1019 GeV is the Planck mass, is too small to fit the the observational data. This mass term\nis most naturally responsible for subdominant effects [5, 6].\nThe general approach to gravity-induced neutrino mass consists in following.\nThe unknown quantum gravity Lagrangian is assumed to be expanded at low energies in series of\nnon-renormalizable operators, each being inversely proportional to the powers of the Planck mass:\nL(\u03c8, \u03c6) =\n\nO(1)\nO(1)\n\u03c8\u03c8\u03c6\u03c6 +\n2 \u03c8\u03c8\u03c8\u03c8 + ... ,\nMPl\nMPl\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c8 and \u03c6 are fermion and boson fields, respectively.\nThe inverse proportionality to MPl is a natural condition of vanishing of these operators when MPl \u2192 \u221e,\ni.e. when gravity is switched off. Assuming the coefficients O(1) in expansion (1) we follow argumentation\nof Hawking [7]. Quantum gravity Lagrangian L and the operators of its expansion (1) should break the\nglobal symmetries [7, 2]. It could be understood, for example, as absorbing a global charge by virtual\nblack hole with its consequent evaporation. In particular, naively one may expect that these operators\ncould be flavor blind. On the other hand these operators should respect the gauge symmetries and gauge\ndiscrete symmetries. In particular, the Lagrangian (1) must have SU(2)\u00d7U(1) symmetry for the Standard\nModel fields, before this symmetry is spontaneously broken.\nIn this paper we address the question whether the gravity in extra-dimension theory with the fundamental scale MX < MPl can provide an alternative mechanism for generation of neutrino masses.\nThere are two specific features in gravitationally induced neutrino masses. The first one is gravity\nscale MX , the second is flavor blindness. The scale is essentially unknown and a priori can be in the\nrange 1 TeV \u2264 MX \u2264 MPl . The future development of extra-dimension theory and observations can\ndetermine MX , and neutrino masses hopefully give now the first indication for this value. It is tempting\nto assume that flavor blindness is exact in gravity-induced operators, and the ratios of the coefficients\nin expansion (1) are exactly 1. However, as we argue below the case of approximate flavor blindness is\nmore natural. The exact values of these coefficients can be known in the framework of explicit theory of\n1\n\n\fquantum gravity. In this paper we shall analyze the both cases of exact and approximate flavor blindness.\nThe above signatures of the discussed mechanism are not very promising, though they are not worse than\nfor the see-saw mechanism.\nWhat is preferable scale of gravity in extra-dimension theory? A fundamental result of this theory\nis that the scale can be less than the Planck mass. The real break-through in the status of this theory\nwas made in works [8], where it was demonstrated that the scale can be as low as O (TeV), without\ncontradiction with basic observational data. An attractive feature of this version is the solution of\nthe hierarchy problem without imposing the supersymmetry. However, TeV gravity scale meets severe\nproblems with much higher scale constraints, coming from different elementary particle processes, such as\n\u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3, \u03c0 \u2192 e\u03bd, K1 - K2 mass difference, proton decay and neutrino masses. The different symmetries\nshould be imposed (see e.g. [9]) to forbid these processes. Thus it seems quite plausible that the scale\nis much larger, as follows from the above-mentioned processes, and can reach MX \u223c 1015 GeV, where\naccording Horava-Witten scenario [10] gravity starts to feel the extra dimensions. In our work we shall\nuse such a large scale for the numerical analysis. More generally, neutrino mass can provide us with\nthe first reasonable indication to the fundamental gravity scale MX , if it 1 TeV\u226a MX < MPl . For the\ngravity-induced neutrino mass, the scale responsible for it is strictly fixed as the physical quantity, i.e. it\nis the fundamental gravity scale MX .\nThis approach to the theory of neutrino masses can be compared with the more conventional one\nbased on GUT ideas. It seems that GUT models are superior since they have their own motivations and\nhappen to produce neutrino masses in the correct ball-park. But at closer examination, this argument\nis not completely satisfactory. For instance, it is possible to achieve supersymmetric SU(5) unification\nwith MGUT \u223c 2 \u00d7 1016 GeV, but firstly SU(5) by itself cannot be a theory of right-handed neutrino\nmasses, since \u03bdR 's are gauge singlets and secondly the scale MGUT is anyway one-two order of magnitude\ntoo large to provide the \"observed\" neutrino masses. On general grounds, SO(10) is more appealing,\nsince it hosts \u03bdR . However, there are (at least) two types of SO(10) models: those where the \u03bdR mass\ncome from non-renormalizable coupling with 16H * 16H /MP l and those where the \u03bdR mass is provided\nby renormalizable coupling with 126H higgs. In the first case, the \u03bdR mass is once again induced by\nthe fundamental gravity scale, as evident from the presence of 1/MP l term. In the second case, the\nscale of \u03bdR mass can be either the scale of left-right (intermediate) symmetry breaking, or a scale arising\naccidentally (see e.g. [11]). From this brief examination, two conclusions can be derived: (i) The detailed\nGUT model is needed to fix the physical meaning of the mass scale responsible for neutrino masses.\n(ii) In some popular SO(10) models, one must resort again to quantum gravity. At present there is no\nselfconsistent \"standard\" GUT model, where neutrino masses are numerically predicted on the basis of\ninternal GUT scale with clear physical meaning and fixed value. The advantage of the GUT theories is\nthe principal possibility to perform the analytic model calculations, while such possibility does not exist\nyet in quantum gravity.\nNow, in order to provide the connection with neutrino masses, we offer a brief overview of the present\nexperimental and theoretical situation. The magnitude of the neutrino masses and mixings are governed\nby the texture of the neutrino mass matrix in the flavor basis, denoted by M . This is related to the\ndiagonal mass matrix via the relation, M = U \u2217 diag(M ) U \u2020 , where U is the usual neutrino mixing\nmatrix specified by three angles, \u03b812 = \u03c9, \u03b823 = \u03c8, \u03b813 = \u03c6 and one CP violating phase \u03b4. The two\nMajorana phases \u03c1 and \u03c3 can be incorporated in the diagonal masses.1 Neutrino oscillation data provide\nus with information on the mixing angles, but constrain only on the mass squared differences defined\n2\n2\nby, \u2206M21\n= M22 \u2212 M12 and \u2206M32\n= M32 \u2212 M22 [12, 13, 14] and not on the absolute neutrino masses,\nthough there are upper bounds coming from laboratory experiments [15, 16] and from cosmology [17].\nIt should be borne in mind that the limits coming from cosmology are crucially dependent on various\nassumptions [18]. In addition, there is no constraint at present on \u03b4 and on the Majorana phases. This\nhas the consequence that M is not uniquely determined and there are various textures consistent with\n1 We\n\nassume three light left handed Majorana neutrinos throughout the analysis.\n\n2\n\n\fpresent data. Attempts to reconstruct the mass matrix using available data from neutrino experiments\nare presented in [19, 20]. However, any phenomenological approach has to face the limitations outlined\nabove. The theoretical counterpart of this situation is that it is possible to postulate several textures of\nmass matrices which are consistent with present data. There are a large number of studies where this\napproach has been developed, for example see [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35].\nA striking feature of most of the textures listed in the above references is that there are always some\nentries which are very small or zero in the mass matrix, while some elements are O(1). This could be\ndue to some underlying symmetries or selection rules, see e.g., [36]. In this assumption, the texture is\nfar from what can be called as a \"democratic\" structure. However, imposing discrete symmetries on the\nmass matrix can lead to a democratic structure for the mass matrix [37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42]. The idea of\n\"anarchy\" in the structure of the mass matrix has also been investigated [43, 44]. A nice summary of the\nabove issues has been recently given in [45].\n\n2\n\nNeutrino mass textures induced by gravity\n\nThe relevant gravitational dimension-5 operator for the spinor SU (2)L isodoublets,2 \u03c8\u03b1 = (\u03bd\u03b1 , l\u03b1 ) and\nthe scalar one, \u03c6 = (\u03c6+ , \u03c60 ), can be written with the operators introduced by Weinberg [46] as:\nLgrav =\n\n\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\n\u22121\n(\u03c8Aa\u03b1 \u01ebAC \u03c6C ) Cab\n(\u03c8Bb\u03b2 \u01ebBD \u03c6D ) + h.c.,\n2MX\n\n(2)\n\nwhere MX is the gravity scale, which in the case of extra dimensional theories can be less than MPl and\n\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2 are numbers O(1). In eq.(2), all indices are explicitly shown: the Lorentz indices a, b = 1, 2, 3, 4\nare contracted with the charge conjugation matrix C, the SU (2)L isospin indices A, B, C, D = 1, 2 are\ncontracted with \u01eb = i\u03c32 (\u03c3m with m = 1, 2, 3 are the Pauli matrices). After spontaneous electroweak\nsymmetry breaking, the Lagrangian (2) generates terms of neutrino mass: Lmass = \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2 v 2 /2MX \u03bd\u03b1 C \u22121 \u03bd\u03b2 ,\nwhere v=174 GeV denotes the vacuum expectation value.\nThe matrix \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2 gives the neutrino mass matrix in the flavor representation. An attractive assumption\nof the exact flavor blindness of quantum gravity corresponds to the equal values of \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2 , e.g. \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2 = 1.\nHowever, the flavor blindness cannot be the exact. It is broken, though weakly, by radiative corrections.\nIt should be broken more strongly by topological fluctuations (wormhole effects).\nEven in the case quantum gravity itself provides equal coupling constants in the Lagrangian (2) e.g.\n\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2 = 1, the topological fluctuations at the Planck scale lift this flavor symmetry, making the coupling\nconstants different [47],[48]. This effect can be described as the renormalization due to the Planck-size\nbaby universes which contain the appropriate particle states. In other words, \"the ungauged coupling\nconstants can be transferred to baby universes\" [47]. If in the parent universe all couplings are equal\n\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2 = 1, in the state with baby universes these coupling constants can be substantially different.\nIt is natural to expect that the wormhole effects give to the Lagrangian (2) the contribution of the\nsame order as other mechanisms of quantum gravity, e.g. exchange by virtual black hole. It makes an\nassumption of an approximate flavor blindness \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2 \u223c O(1), used in the earlier works [2] - [4], plausible. In the applications below we shall study the both cases, exact and approximate flavor blindness,\ndemonstrating that exact flavor blindness as the mechanism for neutrino-mass generation is disfavoured.\n2 Here and everywhere below we use Greek letters \u03b1, \u03b2,... for the flavor states and Latin letters i, j, k... for the mass\nstates.\n\n3\n\n\f2.1\n\nExact flavor blindness\n\nLet us consider first the case of the exact flavor blindness and show that it cannot describe all observational\ndata.\nThe mass matrix in the flavor basis is given by:\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n1\n1 \uf8f8,\n1\n\n1 1\nM = \u03bc\uf8ed 1 1\n1 1\n\n(3)\n\nwere we have defined \u03bc = v 2 /MX . Since the eigenvalues of the matrix are 3, 0, 0 in units of \u03bc, it is\nobvious that there is only one scale for oscillations. Let us first demand that this is the solar neutrino\nscale. Equating the scale obtained from eq.(3) to the present best fit value of 7 \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 obtained from\nanalyses of neutrino data [12] gives us:\nMX \u2248 1016 GeV.\n\n(4)\n\nThe texture specified in eq.(3) gives the following form for the neutrino mixing matrix:\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec\nU =\uf8ed\n\n\u221a1\n2\n\n0\n\u2212 \u221a12\n\n\u221a1\nq6\n\n\u2212\n\n\u221a1\n6\n\n2\n3\n\n\u221a1\n3\n\u221a1\n3\n\u221a1\n3\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8.\n\n(5)\n\nWith this texture we have only one non-zero mass difference \u2206M 2 = M32 \u2212 M12 = M32 \u2212 M22 , which\n2\ncan be identified with \u2206Msol\n. It is straightforward to calculate the survival probability\n\u221aPee and \u03b8sol as\n2\nsin 2\u03b8sol = 8/9, or \u03b8sol \u2248 35\u25e6 in good agreement with data [13, 14]. The value Ue3 = 1/ 3 is compatible\n2\nwith CHOOZ constraints [49] since in this case \u2206Msol\nhL/Ei \u226a 1.\nAlternatively, requiring the oscillation scale to be the atmospheric neutrino scale of 2 \u2212 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 ,\nwe get:\nMX \u2248 1015 GeV.\n\n(6)\n\nBut\n\u221a here the CHOOZ constraint [49] becomes operative and since the texture in eq.(3) predicts Ue3 =\n1/ 3, it is observationally excluded. So there is no space to explain the atmospheric neutrino problem.\nHence we see that an exact flavor blind texture, generated at a typical GUT scale can explain at best\nthe solar neutrino problem in terms of oscillations. An additional mechanism is needed to provide the\natmospheric neutrino mass squared difference (even though it is not clear whether such a mechanism can\nbe implemented without destabilizing the value of the solar mixing angle that we found).\n\n2.2\n\nApproximate flavor blindness\n\nIn the rest of this work we shall consider the case of an approximate flavor blindness \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2 . We will follow\na straightforward procedure to compare this assumption with the data. First we construct the diagonal\nmass matrix allowed by the data, using the known values of \u2206M 2 's and the bounds on the absolute mass\nscale. Then we transform the mass matrix to the flavor basis, using the neutrino mixing matrix that\nsatisfies the observational constraints. Finally, we select the cases when all elements of the obtained mass\nmatrix are O(1).\n4\n\n\fGeneral form of the mass matrix Let us consider first the general form of neutrino mixing matrix.\nIn the approximation \u03b813 = 0 it has a form\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nc\u03c9\ns\u03c9\n0\nc\u03c9\n\uf8ec s\n\u221a\n\u221a1 \uf8f7 ,\n(7)\nU = \uf8ed \u2212 \u221a\u03c92\n2\n2 \uf8f8\ns\nc\n\u221a\u03c9\n\u221a\u03c9\n\u221a1\n\u2212\n2\n2\n2\nwhere s\u03c9 = sin \u03c9 and c\u03c9 = cos \u03c9 with \u03c9 being the solar neutrino mixing angle. The atmospheric neutrino\nmixing angle \u03c8 = \u03b823 is taken to be 45\u25e6 . The mass matrix in the diagonal form is taken to be:\ndiag(M ) = diag(z1 , z2 , z3 ),\n\n(8)\n\nwhere z1 = M1 e2i\u03c1 and z2 = M2 e2i\u03c3 are complex numbers, z3 = M3 is real and \u03c1 and \u03c3 denote the\nMajorana phases. We now transform diag(M ) to the flavor basis using the matrix given in eq.(7) and\nobtain:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1\n1\n\u221a\nz1 c2\u03c9 + z2 s2\u03c9\ns (z \u2212 z1 )\n\u2212 2\u221a\ns (z \u2212 z1 )\n2 2 2\u03c9 2\n2 2\u03c9 2\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\u221a\nM = \uf8ec 2 2 s2\u03c9 (z2 \u2212 z1 )\n(9)\n2 (z1 s\u03c9 + z2 c\u03c9 + z3 )\n2 (z3 \u2212 z1 s\u03c9 \u2212 z2 c\u03c9 ) \uf8f7 .\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u2212 2\u221a\ns (z \u2212 z1 )\n2 (z3 \u2212 z1 s\u03c9 \u2212 z2 c\u03c9 )\n2 (z1 s\u03c9 + z2 c\u03c9 + z3 )\n2 2\u03c9 2\nWe consider the texture specified in eq.(9) for the three possible types of the neutrino mass spectrum:\nhierarchical, inverted hierarchical and degenerate.\nHierarchical mass spectrum Let us begin with the case of the hierarchical mass spectrum. If M1 \u226a\nM2 \u226a M3 , then it is obvious from eq.(9) that the elements of the 2-3 block of the matrix M are large\nin comparison to the other elements. The O(1) coefficients depart from equality by about one order of\nmagnitude. Hence, this texture is rather different from a O(1) texture and it is not compatible with the\nproperties of the operators induced by gravity.\nInverted hierarchical spectrum Without loss of generality we can choose M3 \u226a M1 \u2248 M2 where\n2\nM2 and M1 are split by the solar scale \u2206M21\n. In this case we get,\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n1\n1\n\u221a\ns (e2i\u03c3 \u2212 e2i\u03c1 ) \u2212 2\u221a\ns (e2i\u03c3 \u2212 e2i\u03c1 )\ne2i\u03c1 c2\u03c9 + e2i\u03c3 s2\u03c9\n2 2 2\u03c9\n2 2\u03c9\n\uf8ec\n1\n1 2i\u03c1 2\ns (e2i\u03c3 \u2212 e2i\u03c1 )\ns\u03c9 + e2i\u03c3 c2\u03c9 )\n\u2212 12 (e2i\u03c1 s2\u03c9 + e2i\u03c3 c2\u03c9 ) \uf8f7\n(10)\nM = \u03bc \uf8ed 2\u221a\n\uf8f8,\n2 (e\n2 2\u03c9\n1\n1 2i\u03c1 2\n1 2i\u03c1 2\n2i\u03c3\n2i\u03c1\n2i\u03c3 2\n2i\u03c3 2\n\u221a\n\u2212 2 2 s2\u03c9 (e \u2212 e ) \u2212 2 (e s\u03c9 + e c\u03c9 )\ns\u03c9 + e c\u03c9 )\n2 (e\np\n2 . For arbitrary values of the phases, M does not have an O(1) texture; e.g., this does\nwhere \u03bc = \u2206M31\nnot happen if \u03c1 = \u03c3 since in this case some elements of the mass matrix vanish. However, for certain\nvalues of the phases, e.g., \u03c1 = 0\u25e6 and \u03c3 = 90\u25e6 , eq.(10) becomes:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nsin2\u03c9\n\u221a\n\u221a\ncos2\u03c9\n\u2212 sin2\u03c9\n2\n2\n\uf8ec\ncos2\u03c9 \uf8f7\n\u221a\n\u2212 cos2\u03c9\nM = \u03bc \uf8ed \u2212 sin2\u03c9\n(11)\n\uf8f8.\n2\n2\n2\nsin2\u03c9\ncos2\u03c9\ncos2\u03c9\n\u221a\n\u2212 2\n2\n2\nThe texture defined by eq.(11) does have an O(1) structure for the large value of \u03c9 = 34\u25e6 suggested by\nthe data. We also have to satisfy the relation \u03bc2 = 2 \u2212 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 which results in:\nMX \u2248 1015 GeV.\n\n(12)\n5\n\n\fFor the inverted hierarchy the mass probed\np in neutrinoless double beta decay is related to the atmospheric\n2 \u2248 45 \u2212 55 meV. The case of eq.(11) is the one when the\nneutrino mass splitting, that is, Mee \u223c \u2206M32\ntwo Majorana phases give origin to destructive interference and Mee \u2248 10 \u2212 20 meV, but larger values\ncan be found by varying these phases (compare with the general discussion in [12]). Thus, a large value\nof Mee = 15 \u2212 50 meV characterizes the scenario where the spectrum of mass has an inverted hierarchy\nand a non-GUT matrix is responsible for the observed neutrino phenomena.\nDegenerate mass spectrum For the degenerate spectrum specified by M1 \u2248 M2 \u2248 M3 \u2261 \u03bc (with\nthe common value of the masses \u03bc being much more than the splittings between the levels) an analysis\nsimilar to the previous one applies. Again, an O(1) texture appears for certain choices of the Majorana\nphases. In this case, for a common neutrino mass of about an electronvolt we get:\nMX \u2248 1013 GeV,\n\n(13)\n\nFor the same choices of Majorana phases of eq.(11) the mass probed in neutrinoless double beta decay\nis: Mee \u2248 \u03bc cos2\u03c9, where \u03bc is bounded above by the kinematic limit coming from tritium experiments.\nAs in the previous case, this is the minimum value of Mee : other choices of Majorana phases will always\nlead to a higher value. Of course, from the viewpoint of double beta decay experiments this is the most\nappealing feature of this scenario.\n\n2.3\n\nMinimal deviations from flavor blindness\n\nAs we discussed above, the approximate flavor blindness is a natural option, and in order to describe the\nneutrino-mass data one should introduce deviations from exact flavor blindness. This brings us to the\nquestion what is the minimal deviation which is needed to fit the data. In practice, we will consider the\nabsolute values |M\u03b1\u03b2 | and discuss, in the three cases considered above, for which choice of the Majorana\nphases the differences between the matrix elements are minimal.\nAssuming normal hierarchy of the spectrum we get\n|Mex | \u2264 |Mxx |/6 where x = \u03bc or \u03c4,\n\n(14)\n\n2\n2\n/\u2206Matm\n)1/2 , or the upper bound on the\nwhere the numerical coefficient 1/6 is the ratio of masses (\u2206Msol\nmixing angle \u03b813 . The minimal deviations are anyway large and this is the reason why normal hierarchy\nis disfavored when we assume that all the elements of the mass matrix have the comparable values.\n\nAssuming inverted hierarchy we get\n\u001a\n\n|Mee |2 \u2248 |2Mxx|2 \u221d 1 \u2212 sin2 2\u03b812 sin2 \u03be\n|Mex |2 \u221d 1/2 sin2 2\u03b812 sin2 \u03be\n\n(15)\n\np\n2\nwhere x = \u03bc or \u03c4 as in eq. (14), \u03be = \u03c1\u2212 \u03c3, and where the proportionality constant is \u2206Matm\n\u2248 50 meV;\n2\n2\nsmaller terms order \u2206Msol /\u2206Matm are omitted. Requiring that |Mex | is between |Mee | and |Mxx | we\nthus get the condition\nq\n2\n|Mee | = (0.58 \u2212 0.82) \u2206Matm\n= 29 \u2212 41 meV,\n\n(16)\n\nwhich implies that it will be observable by next generation experiments. However, the minimal deviation\nfrom exact blindness is a factor of 2 (namely, the ratio between |Mee | and |Mxx |) and this makes the\nscenario of inverted hierarchy less appealing.\n6\n\n\fFigure 1: Comparison of the prediction of eq. (17) (thick line) with the general range for Mee allowed\nwith 3 neutrinos (thin lines). The upper bound on m is from Ref. [17]. The lower bound on Mee is the\n1 \u03c3 range in Ref. [54] divided by 2 in order to account for the uncertainty in nuclear matrix elements for\nthe 0\u03bd2\u03b2 transition 76 Ge \u2192 76 Se e\u2212 e\u2212 .\nAssuming degenerate neutrinos, we obtain the most interesting scenario. In fact, when we fix the\nMajorana phases \u03c1 and \u03c3, prescribing |Mee | = |Me\u03bc | and |M\u03bc\u03c4 | = |M\u03bc\u03bc |, we immediately realize that it\nis possible to arrange\n\u221a\n|M\u03b1\u03b2 | = m/ 3,\n\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2 = e, \u03bc, \u03c4\n\n(17)\n\nsetting again \u03b813 = 0 and \u03b823 = 45\u25e6 , and omitting the small \u2206Mij2 /m2 terms.\nThis implies that the limit obtained in cosmology, m < 0.23 eV at 95 % CL can be translated in a\nlimit on the mass seen in double beta decay:\n|Mee | < 0.13 eV\n\n(18)\n\nThis is smaller than the value suggested by the new analysis of the Heidelberg-Moscow data [54] 0.44+0.14\n\u22120.20 eV\n(at 3 \u03c3 level), even if one takes 1\u03c3 lower experimental value and assumes that the nuclear matrix elements\nhave been underestimated (see figure 1). Such a small value m\u03bde \u2248 m \u2248 0.23 eV, being interesting for\nthe forthcoming KATRIN experiment, does not not guarantee a 3 \u03c3 discovery with the present facility.\nFrom eq. (17) one obtains the value of the mass Mee = 0.19 eV\nmcosm = 3m = 1.0 eV,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere we used Mee = 0.19 eV, which is 1 \u03c3 lower than the value that explains the Heidelberg-Moscow\nresults, reduced by 50 %. This implies that, in deriving cosmological bound the errors were underestimated or the assumptions do not hold. A value m\u03bde \u2248 m \u2248 0.33 eV should permit a 3 \u03c3 discovery in\nKATRIN.\n7\n\n\fNote that when we assume that the violation of flavor blindness is minimal, the theoretical framework\nbecomes more restrictive and the predictions for the neutrinoless double beta decay process become more\nprecise. This can be understood well from figure 1, since for instance one can reconcile the cosmological\nbound and Heidelberg-Moscow findings in the 3 neutrino context if Mee \u223c m \u223c 0.2 eV. Of course, under\nthis assumption one has the non-minimal deviations from the flavor blindness.\nThe case of eq. (17) has been considered for the first time by Frigerio and Smirnov in a phenomenological analysis of all possible neutrino mass matrices: see ref. ([20]), second paper. Our approach permits\na step forward, since this is not one case among many other, but the only possible case once that we\nrequire that the deviations from flavor blindness are minimal.\n\n3\n\nRenormalization group effects\n\nAs we have seen in the previous section, the scales where we want gravity to generate the mass matrix\nare typical GUT scales or a little lower. Hence one has to consider the effect of renormalization group\n(RG) evolution from this scale to the electroweak scale on the mass matrix. In both the standard model\nand its minimal supersymmetric extension, the RG effects are negligible as far as the structure of the\nmass matrix is concerned. However oscillation observables can be significantly altered, especially for the\ndegenerate mass spectrum. For the parameter space of interest at present to oscillation phenomenology,\nmodulo fine tuning, the effects of RG are not very large3 [5, 51, 52, 53] except for very large values of the\ncommon neutrino mass (that as recalled above are not favored by the data) and of the parameter tan\u03b2\n(but only for supersymmetric models).\n\n4\n\nSummary and discussion\n\nWe have considered dimension-5 gravity induced operators, suppressed by a low scale of gravity MX <\nMPl , as the source of the neutrino mass matrix. After spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking with\nh\u03c60 i = v, the operator in eq.(2) produces the neutrino mass matrix in flavor basis M\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2 v 2 /MX .\nWe assume an approximate flavor blindness when all \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2 \u223c O(1). The exact values of \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2 is a prerogative\nof the detailed theory of quantum gravity and the wormhole theory.\nWe have demonstrated that for the degenerate and the inverse hierarchical neutrino mass spectrum\nthere are sets of O(1) coefficients when the neutrino masses and mixings satisfy all the observational\ndata. The mass scale for this case is MX \u223c 1013 \u2212 1015 GeV, i.e., close to a typical GUT scale. The\ndiscussed mechanism is not valid for the hierarchical neutrino mass spectrum.\nIn the extreme case of unbroken flavor blindness, \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2 = 1, the gravity-induced neutrino mass matrix can explain at best the solar-neutrino data and an additional mechanism is needed to provide the\natmospheric neutrino mass squared difference.\nThe gravity-induced textures have interesting predictions for the mass Mee probed in neutrinoless\ndouble beta decay. For the inverted hierarchical neutrino mass spectrum the predicted mass parameter\nMee is large, 15 - 50 meV. For degenerate spectra, Mee can saturate the bound from cosmology of 0.23 eV\nor possibly approach the bound of \u223c 1 eV coming from the studies of tritium endpoint spectra. In both\ncases it can explain the result obtained from the recent analysis of the Heidelberg-Moscow experiment,\nalthough the range of compatibility between this result and cosmology is restricted.\nThe conclusions of previous paragraph are more generic than that related to gravity-induced neutrino\nmass model. The specific feature of this model is approximate flavor blindness which favors degenerate\n3 The\n\nconditions when the RG effects can be treated as a perturbation are discussed in ref.[5].\n\n8\n\n\fmass spectrum of neutrinos. Another consequence of this model is the further narrowing of the compatibility of cosmological bounds and the Heidelberg-Moscow results. As discussed in Sect. 2.3, this is due to\nthe fact that the Majorana phases are fixed by the condition of flavor-blindness: see eq. (17) and fig. 1.\nApproximate flavor blindness is a natural prediction of the gravity-induced neutrino mass model, but not\nthe exclusive signature of this model. This model can be probed only by combination of the numerical\nvalue of fundamental gravity scale, found from other data, and approximate flavor blindness. At present\nstage of development, we can only argue that this model is a viable possibility.\n\nAcknowledgement\nWe are grateful to V. Rubakov and A.
