Introduction\nNew physics discovery may be just around the corner as\nthe Large Hadron Collider (LHC) prepares for first collisions this winter. The Standard Model has thus far shown\nimpressive predictive power and agreement with experiment; yet the cause of Electroweak Symmetry Breaking\n(EWSB), necessary to give mass to the W\u00b1 and Z0 bosons,\nremains experimentally unconfirmed. In the last decades,\nmany models outside of the current Standard Model framework have been developed to address this.\nOne way to model a new interaction with unknown couplings is in the form of a \"4-fermion\" contact interaction.\nInteractions with a dimuon final state have been chosen for\nthis analysis, as they provide a clean signature in the early\nstages of understanding the ATLAS detector.\nIn the first year of\n\u221a LHC running, we expect 100 200 pb\u22121 of data at s = 10 TeV. In these proceedings,\nwe discuss the feasibility of discovering or setting limits\non new physics via contact interactions with early ATLAS\ndata. Note also that the results presented here have not yet\nbeen officially approved by the ATLAS Collaboration.\n\n2. Theoretical Background\nBeyond the Standard Model processes, such as large extra spacial dimmensions (LED) in the ADD model [1] or\nquark/lepton compositeness [2], may be described as a 4fermion contact interaction. In the same spirit as the Fermi\nInteraction describes \u03b2 -decay without directly knowing\nthe intermediate process [3], one can write an effective Lagrangian describing a new interaction [4]:\n\u0001\ng2\n[ \u03b7LL (\u03c8\u0304L \u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8L ) \u03c8\u0304L\u2032 \u03b3\u03bc \u03c8L\u2032\n2\n\u039b\n\u0001\n+ \u03b7RR (\u03c8\u0304R \u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8R ) \u03c8\u0304R\u2032 \u03b3\u03bc \u03c8R\u2032\n\u0001\n+ \u03b7LR (\u03c8\u0304L \u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8L ) \u03c8\u0304R\u2032 \u03b3\u03bc \u03c8R\u2032\n\u0001\n+ \u03b7RL (\u03c8\u0304R \u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8R ) \u03c8\u0304L\u2032 \u03b3\u03bc \u03c8L\u2032 ] ,\n\nL =\n\n(1)\n\n\u2032\nwhere g is a coupling constant, and \u03c8L,R and \u03c8L,R\nare the\nincoming and outgoing left and right fermionic fields, re-\n\nspectively. The interaction appears experimentally as a deviation from the SM dilepton mass spectrum, which originates from Drell-Yan (DY) production (qq\u0304 \u2192 \u03b3 , Z \u2192 l + l \u2212 ).\nThe value of \u03b7 is the sign of the interaction term; there can\nbe either constructive (\u03b7 = \u22121) or destructive (\u03b7 = +1)\ninterference with the DY process.\n\u2745\n\u2745\nq \u2758\u2745\n\u2712 q\u2032\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745 q\u0304\u2032\nq\u0304\n\u2720\n\u2745\n\u25a0\n\u2745\n\n\u2745\n\u2745\nq \u2758\u2745\n\u2712 l\u2212\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745 l+\nq\u0304\n\u2720\n\u2745\n\u25a0\n\u2745\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\nFigure 1: Representative Feynman diagrams for various 4fermion contact interactions.

Contact Interaction Analysis Method\nMonte Carlo event generation using PYTHIA [5] has\nbeen done for the parity-conserving Left-left Isoscalar\nModel (L-LIM) of fermion compositeness, corresponding\nto the first term in Eq. (2). We chose four benchmark signal values to calculate the expected limit: \u039b = 5, 7, 9 and\n12 TeV. In the event generation stage, the following selection criteria were used:\n\u2022 two or more final state muons from the hard scattering\n\u2022 dimuon invariant mass M\u03bc \u03bc > 120 GeV\n\u2022 transverse momentum pT > 5 GeV and pseudorapidity |\u03b7 | < 2.8 for final state muons.\nThese requirements were chosen in order to increase statistics in the signal region and to be within the geometrical acceptance of the Muon Spectrometer. In Table I, we\nshow the production cross-section times the muon branching fraction (X \u2192 \u03bc \u03bc ) for each of the benchmark \u039b values. Detector response was simulated using the standard\nATLAS fast simulation, and the resulting dimuon invariant\nmass was calculated. We then multiply by a mass dependent k-factor (ranging from 1.31 to 1.15 from 120 GeV to\n2000 GeV [6]) and a dimuon reconstruction efficiency factor of (0.85)2 = 0.07225. After event generation and fast\nsimulation, muon candidates are chosen to be within pseudorapidity |\u03b7 | < 2.5 (the geometrical acceptance of the\nInner Detector [7]) and dimuons are required to have an\ninvariant mass M\u03bc \u03bc > 120 GeV. Fig. 3 shows the resulting dimuon differential cross-section in the constructive\nLeft-left Isoscalar Model. The DY spectrum corresponds\nto \u039b \u2192 \u221e.\n\n3.1.

The number of events in any region\nis given by N = L \u03b5\u03c3 b f (X \u2192 \u03bc \u03bc ), where L is the integrated luminosity, \u03b5 is the acceptance and reconstruction\nefficiency, \u03c3 is the differential cross-section from Eq (3),\nand (b f (X \u2192 \u03bc \u03bc )) is the branching fraction in the dimuon\nchannel. When taking the ratio R\u039b,DY from Monte Carlo\nsimulations or Rd from collected data, the uncertainty in\nthe luminosity cancels in the ratio. The effect of stronglycorrelated uncertainties between the two regions is also reduced, which is especially advantageous in the first months\nof data taking, when the uncertainties are expected to be\nlarge.\nThe ratio in Eq. (4), expected for the DY-only spectrum,\ncan be compared with an expected signal ratio using the\nfollowing significance calculation:\nR\u039b \u2212 RDY\nSlim = q\n.\n2\n\u03c3\u039b2 + \u03c3DY\n\n(5)\n\nHere \u03c3\u039b is the statistical uncertainty on the signal ratio,\n\n\fProceedings of the DPF-2009 Conference, Detroit, MI, July 27-31, 2009\nassuming that new physics did exist but had fluctuated\ndownwards and was missed. Systematic uncertainties on\nthe background ratio are incorporated in \u03c3DY , which include detector effects and our limited knowledge of Standard Model parton density functions, backgrounds, etc. In\ncalculating the actual limit, we would use real data in place\nof the DY-only Monte Carlo sample for comparison to the\nratio expected for a given \u039b scale.

The efficiency uncertainty was chosen to\nrise from 1% to 15% over the mass range of 120 GeV2000 GeV, the resolution uncertainty calculation was based\non a mis-alignment the Muon Spectrometer four times\nworse than design, and the k-factor uncertainty was based\non minimizing and maximizing the slope of the massdependent k-factor functional form within errors previously determined [6]. Note that the values quoted are an\nexaggeration of expected first-year systematics.

We have found that the\nmaximum is very broad in M0 , and that increasing the luminosity does not affect the chosen mass cut significantly.\nTable III Ratios RDY and R\u039b are shown for each \u039b with corresponding best M0 cut in 100 pb\u22121 .\nDrell-Yan only\nDrell-Yan + signal\n\u039b\nBest M0\nNhigh\nNhigh\nRDY\nR\u039b\n\u03c3\u039b\nNlow\nNlow\n5 TeV 450 GeV\n7 TeV 540 GeV\n9 TeV 750 GeV\n12 TeV 780 GeV\n\nTo determine the impact of statistical uncertainty in\nthe signal ratios (\u03c3\u039b ), the RMS of R\u039b distributions from\nperforming 10000 pseudo-experiments were calculated on\neach of the benchmark values (Fig. 4, Table III). The\nnumber of sample events (Ni ) chosen for the ith pseudoexperiment was determined from a Poisson distribution\nabout the expected number of events Nexpected in 100 pb\u22121\n(or 200 pb\u22121 ) of data. Each pseudo-experiment was then\ncreated by randomly sampling Ni events from a dataset corresponding to hundreds of fb\u22121 .\nThe value of the expected ratios RDY,\u039b are highly dependent on the choice of M0 , the cutoff between the high and\nlow dimuon invariant mass regimes. To account for this,\nwe calculate Slim as a function of M0 (Fig. 5).

After fitting the significance for the various \u039b values (5, 7, 9 and 12 TeV), we\nexpect to be able to set a new limit on the constructive LLIS model of fermion compositeness at \u039b = 7.5 TeV with\n100 pb\u22121, or \u039b = 8.7 TeV with 200 pb\u22121 (Fig. 7).\n\n\f7\n\nATLAS Work in Progress\n\u039b = 5 TeV (100 pb-1)\n\nS [\u03c3]\n\nProceedings of the DPF-2009 Conference, Detroit, MI, July 27-31, 2009\nS [\u03c3]\n\n4\n\n\u039b = 5 TeV (200 pb-1)\n\n\u039b = 7 TeV (200 pb-1)\n\n3\n\n6\n\n2.8\n\n5.5\n\n2.6\n\n5\n\n2.4\n\n4.5\n\n2.2\n\n4\n\n2\n\n3.5\n\n1.8\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1.6\n300\n\n1000\nmass cut (GeV)\nS [\u03c3]\n\n200\n\n2\n\n\u039b = 7 TeV (100 pb-1)\n\n3.2\n\n6.5\n\nS [\u03c3]\n\n3.4 ATLAS Work in Progress\n\nATLAS Work in Progress\n\n1.8\n\n1\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900 1000 1100\nmass cut (GeV)\n\nATLAS Work in Progress\n\n0.9\n0.8\n\n1.6\n\n0.7\n\n1.4\n\n0.6\n\n1.2\n\n0.5\n0.4\n\u039b = 9 TeV (200 pb-1)\n\n300\n\n\u039b = 12 TeV (100 pb-1)\n\n\u039b = 9 TeV (100 pb-1)\n\n1\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900 1000 1100\nmass cut (GeV)\n\n\u039b = 12 TeV (200 pb-1)\n\n0.3\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900 1000 1100\nmass cut (GeV)\n\n0.05\nATLAS Work in Progress\n\n0.045\n\nS [\u03c3]\n\nRatio\n\nFigure 5: Distributions of significance (Slim ) by varying M0 for different \u039b values, with the blue curve corresponding to 100 pb\u22121 and\nthe red curve corresponding to 200 pb\u22121 .\n\n10\n\nsqrt(s) = 10 TeV\n100 pb-1 (stat only)\n100 pb-1 (with sys)\n200 pb-1 (stat only)\n200 pb-1 (with sys)\n95% C.L.\n\n8\n\n0.04\n\nsqrt(s) = 10 TeV, 100pb-1\n\n0.035\n\nBackground+systematics\n\n7\n6\n\nSignal+statistical\n\n0.03\n\n5\n\n0.025\n\n4\n\n0.02\n\n3\n\n0.015\n\n2\n\n0.01\n\n1\n\n0.005\n0\n5\n\nATLAS Work in Progress\n\n9\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n12\nLambda\n\nFigure 6: Ratio versus Lambda, using M0 for maximized significance.\n\nReferences\n[1] N.
