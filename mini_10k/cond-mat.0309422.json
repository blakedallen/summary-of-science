By calculating the non-equilibrium parameter of the probability distribution function and the singularity spectrum\nof multifractal we have quantified the dynamical heterogeneity in strongly correlated many-body systems.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nWe have numerically studied the dynamical heterogeneity in strongly correlated many-body systems, for example, the critical spin state[1], the supercooled liquid near\nthe glass transition[2] and the turbulence[3]. These systems are scale-invariant and multifractal. In this paper\nwe briefly review how we quantify the dynamical heterogeneity and discuss in detail the turbulence simulation\ndata recently obtained.\nIn order to quantify the dynamical heterogeneity we\nhave two measures. One is the non-equilibrium parameter q of the R\u00e9nyi-Tsallis distribution function. The other\nis the singularity spectrum f (\u03b1). These two measures are\nclosely related and important ingredients of the multifractal analysis.\nIn the numerical study of the critical spin state[1] we\nhave found that the q-parameter represents the degree of\nnon-equilibrium. We have actually quantified the deviation of the q-parameter from the equilibrium value according to the spatio-temporal scale of the observation.\nIn the numerical study of the the supercooled liquid near the glass transition[2] we have found that the\nbroken-bond distribution which reflects the nature of the\ncooperatively rearranging region is well described by the\nsingularity spectrum f (\u03b1) of multifractal. The width of\nthe spectrum becomes broader as approaching the glass\ntransition. Such a broadening is similar to that observed\nin the numerical study of the Anderson-localization transition.\n\nTURBULENCE SIMULATION\nIn the numerical study of the turbulence[3] we have\nadopted the lattice Boltzmann method.

The intermittent distribution of the strength of\nthe vortices.\n\nmean-field analysis\nTurbulence is one of the typical phenomena with multiscale motions. Each phenomena of a scale strongly couples with all the other scales of turbulent motion. In order to analyze such a system a scale-dependent entropy,\nthe so-called \u03b5-entropy h(\u03b5), works well. For example,\nthe time series of the velocity field in turbulence leads\nto a non-trivial scaling relation, h(\u03b5) \u221d \u03b5\u22123 , expected\nfrom Kolmogorov's scaling. Here \u03b5 is the scale of the\nobservation. The existing experimental data are consistent with this scaling. By our numerical experiment simulating the Navier-Stokes equation we have shown the\nconsistency of the scaling. In contrast to the evaluation\nof the energy spectrum, which is usually employed for\ntesting Kolmogorov's scaling and determined by the two-\n\n\fpoint correlation function, Kolmogorov's scaling is easily observed in the \u03b5-entropy, since it is determined by\nthe mean of the exit time from the observation window\nand fluctuations are averaged out. Such a unifractal scaling is a mean-field description and fluctuations can be\ntaken into account in a multifractal analysis as shown\nin the following. In the above mentioned mean-field description the velocity difference in temporal and spatial\ndirections have the same fractal scaling exponent. Thus\nwe have confirmed Kolmogorov's scaling and Taylor's\nhypothesis at the same time.\n\nfluctuation analysis\nIn order to analyze the fluctuations we use two measures, the non-equilibrium parameter q of the R\u00e9nyiTsallis distribution function and the singularity spectrum\nf (\u03b1).\nThe probability distribution function (PDF) for the\nvelocity or vorticity field is non-Gaussian. The nonGaussianity is quantified by the q-parameter. The strong\nnon-Gaussianity is observed at small spatio-temporal\nscale comparable to that for the coherent vortex in the\nPDF for the velocity or vorticity difference between two\nspace-time points. By using the wavelet denoising we\nhave clarified that the non-Gaussianity or dynamical heterogeneity results from the existence of the coherent vortex which is a strongly-correlated non-equilibrium region.\nThe strength of the vortices is shown in Fig. 1 to be\nintermittent. The spatial distribution of the coherent vortices is quantified by the singularity spectrum of multifractal f (\u03b1) as shown in Fig. 2.\n3.5\n3\n\nf(alpha)\n\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n\nThe remainder of this subsection is devoted to some\nspeculations. As seen in our previous study[2] the width\nof the singularity spectrum depends on the degree of intermittency so that we expect some Reynolds-number\ndependence of the spectrum. It has been discussed by\nmany authors and should be claryfied in future systematic study. In our present study the density of the vortex is\ndilute. Thus the singularity spectrum in Fig. 2 describes\nthe spatial distribution of relatively free vortices. As the\nReynolds number is increased the density increases. In\nthis case the interaction among vortices becomes important and the correlation length of the vorticity fluctuation\nbecomes large. While we can observe the vortex only as\nan individual elementary excitation in our numerical experiment, some collective excitation is expected to dominate at higher Reynolds number. In the limit of divergently large Reynolds number the correlation length becomes divergently large so that we can expect full scaleinvariance. We can find a resemblance to the case of the\nscaling theory in polymers where an ideal scaling relation is realized for dense solutions where polymers are\nstrongly entangled. In the limit of high Reynolds number\neach boxes counting the coherent vortex for calculating\nf (\u03b1) will be filled by almost equal number of vortices\nso that intermittency will disappear and unifractal Kolmogorov's scaling will prevail.\n\nsummary for turbulence simulation\nNumerical simulation data, in real space and time, for\na forced turbulence on the basis of the lattice Boltzmann\nmethod have been analyzed by unifractal and multifractal\nschemes.\nOur new findings are summarized into two points.\nFirst in the unifractal analysis using the exit-time statistics we have verified Kolmogorov's scaling and Taylor's\nhypothesis at the same time. Second in the analysis using the R\u00e9nyi-Tsallis PDF and the wavelet denoising\nwe have clarified that the coherent vortices sustain the\npower-law velocity correlation in the non-equilibrium\nstate.\nFinally in the multifractal analysis it is clarified that\nthe intermittent distribution of the coherent vortices in\nspace-time is described as a multifractal.\n\n1\n\nREFERENCES\n\n0.5\n0\n2.6\n\n2.8\n\n3\n\n3.2\n\n3.4\n\n3.6\n\nalpha\n\nFIGURE 2.
