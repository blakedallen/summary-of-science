The examples give a gentle introduction\nto the emerging fields of one-dependent and determinantal point processes.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nConsider the task of adding a single column of digits:\n7\n9\n4\n8\n3\n6\n1\n6\n8\n\n* 7\n* 6\n0\n* 8\n1\n7\n* 8\n* 4\n2\n\n52\nWe have put a dot to the right of a digit whenever the succeeding addition leads to a\ncarry. The remainder (mod 10) is written to the right of the dot. Thus 7 + 9 = 16\nresults in a dot by the 7 and a remainder of 6. At the end, the total is found by adding\nthe number of dots (here, five) and appending the final remainder (here, 2) for a total of\n52. The dots are a standard bookkeeping device used (for example) in the Trachtenberg\nsystem of speed addition [16].\n\u2217\n\nDepartment of Mathematics, Caltech\nDepartments of Mathematics and Statistics, Stanford\n\u2021\nDepartment of Mathematics, USC\n\u2020\n\n\fHow many carries are typical and how are they distributed? Common sense suggests\nthat about half the places have carries and that if a carry occurs, it is less likely that\nthe next addition gives a carry. Investigating these questions when digits are chosen\nuniformly at random leads to interesting mathematics.\nAs additional motivation, look at the remainder column in the example above. Observe that there is a carry on the left (and so a dot) if and only if there is a descent on\nthe right (a sequence x1 , x2 , . . . has a descent at i if xi > xi+1 ). Further, if the original\ncolumn of digits is independent and uniformly distributed, so is the remainder column.\nThus, the results about carries give the distribution of the descent pattern in a random\nsequence of digits.\nSection 2 derives the distribution theory of carries by elementary arguments. There\nare nice formulae for the chance of any pattern of carries, and the process is onedependent so a variety of probabilistic limit theorems are available.\nSection 3 introduces determinantal point processes, shows that the carries process\nis determinantal, and illustrates how standard tools for determinantal point processes\napply to carries.\nSection 4 reviews the literature on stationary one-dependent processes, shows that\nall of these are determinantal and further that essentially all the neat formulae for carries\nand descents have versions for any stationary one-dependent process. Connections with\nsymmetric function theory are developed. A large class of examples arising from the\nwork of Polishchuk and Positselski [58] on Koszul algebras is shown to yield many\nnatural examples (including the original carries process).\nSection 5 gives combinatorial examples: descents in permutations from both uniform\nand non-uniform distributions, the connectivity set of a permutation, and binomial\nposets.\nSection 6 generalizes from adding numbers to multiplying random elements in a finite\ngroup. For central extensions (e.g., the quaternions), there is again a carries process\nthat is stationary, one-dependent, and determinantal. Thus explicit formulae and limit\ntheorems are available.\nSection 7 contains proofs of some of our more technical results. It shows that any\none-dependent (possibly non-stationary) point process on the integers is determinantal.\nIt also constructs a family of one-dependent determinantal processes (generalizing many\nexamples in earlier sections), and computes its correlation kernel.\n\n2\n\nProbability theory for carries and descents\n\nThroughout this section we work base b and so with the alphabet B = {0, 1, . . . , b \u2212 1}.\nLet B1 , B2 , . . . , Bn be a sequence of randomly chosen elements of B (independent and\nidentically distributed). There is a descent at i if Bi > Bi+1 , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1. Let Xi be 1\nor 0 as there is a descent at i and D = {i : Xi = 1} be the descent set of B1 , B2 , . . . , Bn .\nThe following probabilistic facts are elementary. They are stated for carries but\nverification is easier using descents.\nFact 1. (Single carries)\n\nFor any i \u2208 [n \u2212 1],\nb\u0001\n1\n1\n2\n= 2.\nP (Xi = 1) = \u2212\n2 2b\nb\n\n2\n\n\fThus, when b = 10, the chance of a carry is .45. When b = 2, the chance of a carry is\n.25. For any base, Var(Xi ) = 14 \u2212 4b12 .\nFor any i and j with 1 \u2264 i < i + j \u2264 n,\n\u0012\n\u0013\u001e\nb\nP (Xi = Xi+1 = * * * = Xi+j\u22121 = 1) =\nbj+1 .\nj +1\n\nFact 2. (Runs of carries)\n\nThus, a run of b or more carries is impossible. Further,\n1\nCov (Xi , Xi+1 ) = E (Xi Xi+1 ) \u2212 E(Xi )E(Xi+1 ) = \u2212\n12\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n1\u2212 2\nb\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\nFact 3. (Stationary one-dependence) The distribution of {Xi }i\u2208[n\u22121] is stationary:\nfor J \u2286 [n \u2212 1], i \u2208 [n \u2212 1] with J + i \u2286 [n \u2212 1], the distribution of {Xj }j\u2208J is the same as\nthe distribution of {Xj }j\u2208J+i . Further, the distribution of {Xi }i\u2208[n\u22121] is one-dependent:\nif J \u2286 [n \u2212 1] has j1 , j2 \u2208 J \u21d2 |ji \u2212 j2 | > 1, then {Xj }j\u2208J are jointly independent binary\n1\n. The literature on m-dependent random\nrandom variables with P (Xj = 1) = 12 \u2212 2b\nvariables is extensive. In particular, a classical central limit theorem [40] shows the\nfollowing:\nTheorem 2.1. For n \u2265 2, the total number of carries Tn\u22121 = X1 + * * * + Xn\u22121 has\n1\n1\nmean (n \u2212 1)( 12 \u2212 2b\n), variance n+1\n12 (1 \u2212 b2 ) and, normalized by its mean and variance,\nTn\u22121 has a standard normal limiting distribution for n large.\nRemarks.\n1. An O(n\u22121/2 ) error bound in this central limit theorem can be proved using the\ndependency graph approach to normal approximation by Stein's method [12], [18].\n2. Stationary pairwise independent processes can fail to obey the central limit theorem [7], [43].\nFact 4. (k-point correlations)\n\nFor A \u2286 [n \u2212 1], let\n\n\u03c1(A) = P {Xi = 1 for i \u2208 A}.\nFor |A| = k, the \u03c1(A) are called k-point correlations for the point process X1 , . . . , Xn\u22121 .\nThey are basic descriptive units for general point processes [17]. For the carries and\ndescent process, they are simple to describe. Break A \u2286 [n \u2212 1] into disjoint, non-empty\nblocks of consecutive integers A = A1 \u222a A2 \u222a * * * \u222a Ak . Thus A = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11} =\n{2, 3} \u222a {5, 6, 7} \u222a {11}. From Facts 2 and 3 above,\n\u03c1(A) =\n\nk \u0014\u0012\nY\ni=1\n\n\u0013\u001e\n\u0015\nb\nbai +1\nai + 1\n\nif A =\n\nk\n[\n\ni=1\n\nAi with |Ai | = ai .\n\nLet \u01eb1 , \u01eb2 , . . . , \u01ebn\u22121 be a fixed sequence in {0, 1}. Then\n\u0012\n\u0013\nsj+1 \u2212 si + b \u2212 1\n1\n.\nP {X1 = \u01eb1 , . . . , Xn\u22121 = \u01ebn\u22121 } = n * det\nb\u22121\nb\n\nFact 5. (Determinant formula)\n\nHere, if there are exactly k 1's in the \u01eb-sequence at positions s1 < s2 \u0001< * * * < sk , the\ni +b\u22121\nfor 0 \u2264 i, j \u2264 k\ndeterminant is of a (k + 1) \u00d7 (k + 1) matrix with (i, j) entry sj+1 \u2212s\nb\u22121\nwith s0 = 0, sk+1 = n.\n3\n\n\fExample 1. If n = 8, \u01eb1 = 1, \u01eb2 = \u01eb3 = \u01eb4 = 0, \u01eb5 = 1, \u01eb6 = \u01eb7 = 0, the matrix is\n\uf8eb 1+b\u22121\u0001 5+b\u22121\u0001 8+b\u22121\u0001\uf8f6\nb\u22121\nb\u22121 \u0001\nb\u22121 \u0001\n\uf8ec\n4+b\u22121\n7+b\u22121 \uf8f7\n1\n\uf8ed\nb\u22121\nb\u22121 \u0001\uf8f8 .\n3+b\u22121\n0\n1\nb\u22121\n\nWhen b = 2, this is\n\n\u00102 6 9\u0011\n\nwith determinant 9. Thus the chance of a carry at exactly\n.\npositions 1 and 5 when adding eight binary numbers is 9/28 = .03516. When b = 10,\n.\nthis chance becomes 1, 042, 470/108 = .0104. This is not so much smaller than in the\nbinary case.\n158\n014\n\nProof. (Of fact 5) We follow Stanley [67, p. 69]. Let \u03b1n (S) be the number of sequences\nwith descent set contained in S and \u03b2n (S) the number of sequences with descent set\nequal to S. Then\nX\nX\n\u03b1n (S) =\n\u03b2n (T ),\n\u03b2n (S) =\n(\u22121)|S\u2212T | \u03b1n (T ).\nT \u2286S\n\nT \u2286S\n\nThere is a simple formula for \u03b1n (S): the number\nof weakly increasing sequences with\n\u0001\nentries in {0, 1, . . . , b \u2212 1} of length l is l+b\u22121\nusing\nthe usual stars and bars argument\nb\u22121\n(place b \u2212 1 bars into l + b \u2212 1 places, put symbol 0 to the left of the first bar, symbol 1\nbetween the first and second bar, and so on, with symbol b \u2212 1 to the right of the last\nbar). Then\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\ns1 + b \u2212 1 s2 \u2212 s1 + b \u2212 1\nn \u2212 sk + b \u2212 1\n\u03b1n (S) =\n...\n,\nb\u22121\nb\u22121\nb\u22121\nbecause any such sequence of length n is constructed by concatenating nondecreasing\nsequences of length s1 , s2 \u2212 s1 , . . . , n \u2212 sk . Therefore\nX\n\u03b2n (S) =\n(\u22121)k\u2212j f (0, i1 )f (i1 , i2 ) . . . f (ij , k + 1)\n1\u2264i1 <i2 <***<ij \u2264k\n\n\u0001\ni +b\u22121\n(with s0 = 0, sk+1 = n). From Stanley's discussion, \u03b2n (S) is\nwith f (i, j) = sj \u2212sb\u22121\nthe determinant of the (k+1)\u00d7(k+1) matrix with (i, j) entry f (i, j+1), 0 \u2264 i, j \u2264 k.\nExample 2. From the above\nof n base b digits\n\u0001 n development, the chance that the sum\n.\n8 =\n.03516. When\nhas no carries is n+b\u22121\n/b\n.\nWhen\nn\n=\n8,\nb\n=\n2,\nthis\nis\n9/2\nb\u22121 \u0001\n.\n17\n8\nn = 8, b = 10, this is 9 /10 = .00024. We feel lucky when adding eight numbers with\nno carries. These calculations show that we are lucky indeed.\n\n3\n\nDeterminantal point processes\n\nLet X be a finite set. A point process on X is a probability measure P on the 2|X |\nsubsets of X . For example, if X = {1, 2, . . . , n \u2212 1}, a point process is specified by\nrecording where the carries occur in adding n base b numbers as in Section 2. One\nsimple way to specify P is via its so-called correlation functions. For A \u2286 X , let\n\u03c1(A) = P {S : S \u2287 A}.\n4\n\n\fThe collection of numbers {\u03c1(A)} uniquely determine P using inclusion/exclusion. A\npoint process is determinantal with kernel K(x, y) if\n\u03c1(A) = det (K(x, y))x,y\u2208A .\nOn the right is the determinant of the |A| \u00d7 |A| matrix with (x, y) entry K(x, y) for\nx, y \u2208 A.\nDeterminantal point processes were introduced by Macchi [50] to model the distribution of fermions. See [17] for a textbook account, [65] for a survey, [41] for probabilistic\ndevelopments and [48] for many combinatorial examples. We warn the reader that\nthese last references essentially deal with symmetric kernels K(x, y) whereas all of our\nexamples involve non-symmetric kernels.\nThere has been an explosive development of determinantal point processes over the\npast few years. Some reasons for this include:\n(a) A raft of natural processes (including all those in the present paper) turn out to\nbe determinantal. These include: the eigenvalues of various ensembles of random\nmatrices (Dyson [25, 26, 27], Mehta [55]); the presence or absence of edges if a\nrandom spanning tree is chosen in a graph (Burton\u2013Pemantle [10], Lyons [48]);\nrandom tilings and growth models (Johansson [44]); the structure of random partitions chosen from a variety of measures (e.g., the Plancherel measure on the\nsymmetric group Sn ) (Borodin\u2013Okounkov\u2013Olshanski [5]); random dimers on bipartite planar graphs (Kenyon [46]); and the zeros of a random analytic function\nP\n\u221e\nn\nn=0 an z with i.i.d. complex Gaussian coefficients an [56]. The list goes on\nextensively.\n(b) Specifying a kernel may be much easier than specifying a measure on all 2|X |\nsubsets. Further, the correlation functions allow easy computation of quantities\nof interest. For example, if Xx is 1 or 0 as the random set includes x or not:\nE(Xx ) = K(x, x),\n\u0012\n\u0013\nK(x, x) K(x, y)\nCov(Xx , Xy ) = det\n\u2212 K(x, x)K(y, y)\nK(y, x) K(y, y)\n= \u2212K(x, y)K(y, x).\n\nIf K(x, y) = K(y, x), then the correlation is \u2264 0, a distinctive feature of determinantal point processes.\n(c) If the matrix (K(x, y))x,y\u2208X has all real eigenvalues {\u03bbx }x\u2208X , many theorems\nbecome available for N , the total number of points in a realization of the process.\nThese include:\nP\n\u2022 N is distributed as a sum x\u2208X Yx with {Yx } independent 0/1 random variables having P (Yx = 1) = \u03bbx .\n\u2022 Let \u03bc and \u03c3 denote the mean and variance of N . These are available in terms\nof K from (b) above. Then the following refined form of the central limit\ntheorem holds:\n\u001b\n\u001a\nZ x\n1\n.80\nN \u2212\u03bc\n2\n\u2264x \u2212\u221a\ne\u2212t /2 dt \u2264\nP\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\n2\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\n5\n\n\f\u2022 The probability density P (n) = P (N = n) is a Polya-frequency function. In\nparticular the density is unimodal. Further, |mode \u2212 mean| \u2264 1.\n\u2022 There is a useful algorithm for simulating from K (here assuming K(x, y) =\nK(y, x)).\n\nMost of these properties follow from the fact that the generating function of N ,\nE(xN ) = det (I + (x \u2212 1)K)\nhas all real zeros. See Pitman [57] or Hough, et al. [41] for details.\n(d) If Kn is a sequence of such kernels converging to a kernel K, then, under mild\nrestrictions, the associated point processes converge. See Soshnikov [65] or Johansson and Nordenstam [45] for precise statements and remarkable examples. A\nsimple example is given in Section 5 (Example 11).\nA main result of our paper is that the carries and descent processes, and indeed any\none-dependent point processes on the integers, is determinantal. The special case of\ncarries is stated here; a proof of the general case is in Section 7.\nTheorem 3.1. The point process of carries and descents Pn given in Section 2 is determinantal with correlation kernel K(i, j) = k(j \u2212 i) where\nX\n\nk(m)tm =\n\nm\u2208Z\n\n1\n.\n1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 t)b\n\n1\n1\nExample 3. Take b = 2. Then 1\u2212(1\u2212t)\n2 = 2t(1\u2212t/2) . Replacing t by ct changes k(m)\nto k(m)cm and K(i, j) = k(j \u2212 i) to cj\u2212i k(j \u2212 i) = c\u2212i K(i, j)cj . Conjugating K by a\ndiagonal matrix does not change determinants or the correlation functions. Thus setting\nt\n2 = z, the generating function becomes\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 1\n2\n+ 1 + z + z + ... .\n4 z\n\nWhen e.g., n \u2212 1 = 5, the kernel is\n\uf8ee\n1\n\u0012 \u0013 \uf8ef1\n1 \uf8ef\n\uf8ef0\n4 \uf8ef\n\uf8f00\n0\nFrom this, \u03c1(A) =\n\n\u001a\n\n0\n` 1  \u0301|A|\n4\n\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n\uf8f9\n1\n1\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n1\uf8fa\n\uf8fa.\n1\uf8fb\n1\n\nif A has two consecutive entries\notherwise\n\n(3.1)\n\n. This is a manifestation of the\n\none-dependence together with the fact that (for b = 2), two consecutive carries are\nimpossible. It follows that the possible configurations are all binary strings of length\nn \u2212 1 with no two consecutive 1's. This is a standard coding of the Fibonacci number\nFn+1 (if 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 are the first five Fibonacci numbers). For example, when n = 4, the\npossible configurations are 000, 001, 010, 100, 101.\n6\n\n\fThe eigenvalues of any finite matrix of the form (3.1) are real. This follows from the\nfact that these matrices are totally positive, see [28], and the well known fact that the\neigenvalues of a totally positive matrix are real (and nonnegative), see e.g. Corollary\n6.6 of [1].\nThe classification of [28] also implies that the correlation kernels for b \u2265 3 are not\ntotally positive (for large enough matrix size), and we do not know if their eigenvalues\nare real.\nExample 4.

Here 0 < N \u2264 \u221e. The process is oneN\ndependent if {Xj }i\u22121\nj=0 , {Xj }j=i+1 are independent for all i. A natural example: let\n+1\n2\n{Yi }N\ni=0 be independent uniform random variables on [0, 1]. Let h : [0, 1] \u2192 {0, 1} be\na measurable function. Then Xi = h(Yi , Yi+1 ), 0 \u2264 i \u2264 N , is a one-dependent process\ncalled a two-block factor. Much of the literature on one-dependence is for stationary\n7\n\n\fprocesses. However, if Yi are independent but not identically distributed or h = hi\ndepends on i, the associated Xi is still one-dependent. Our main results in Section 7\nare for general one-dependent processes. We first describe some results for the stationary\ncase.\n\nStationary one-dependent processes\nA book-length review of this subject by de Valk [73] collects together many of the results,\nso we will be brief, focusing on later research. One of the first problems studied is the\nquestion of whether all one-dependent processes are two-block factors. Counterexamples\nwere found [73] though it appears that most \"natural\" one-dependent processes are\ntwo-block factors. For example, let f \u2208 L2 (\u03c0) be a function on the unit circle. Let\nK(i, j) = f\u02c6(i \u2212 j), i, j \u2208 Z, f\u02c6 the Fourier transform. Macchi [50] and Soshnikov [65]\nshow that K(i, j) is the kernel for a determinantal point process on Z. Lyons and Steif\n[49] and Shirai and Takahashi [62, 63] develop remarkable properties of the associated\npoint process. If f (\u03b8) = ae\u2212i\u03b8 + b + cei\u03b8 , the point process is one-dependent and [9]\nshows it is a two-block factor. See also [13].\nA stationary one-dependent process is determined by the numbers ai = P (X1 =\nX2 = * * * = Xi\u22121 = 1), a1 = 1. Indeed, if f = f1 , . . . , fi\u22121 ; e = ei+1 , . . . , en\u22121 are binary\nstrings, P (f, 0, e) + P (f, 1, e) = P (f )P (e). From this P (f, 0, e) = P (f )P (e) \u2212 P (f, 1, e).\nBy similar reductions, the probability of any pattern of occurrences can be reduced\nto a polynomial in the ai . For example, P (0, 0, 0) = 1 \u2212 3a2 + a22 + 2a3 \u2212 a4 . There\nis a remarkable, simple formula for this polynomial as a minor of a Toeplitz matrix.\nWe learned this from [58, Chap. 7]. A generalization to the non-stationary case is in\nSection 7.\nTheorem 4.1. For a stationary one-dependent process, let ai = P (X1 = X2 = * * * =\nXi\u22121 = 1), a1 = 1. Let t1 , . . . , tn\u22121 be a binary string with j zeros at positions S =\n{s1 < * * * < sk } \u2286 [n \u2212 1]. Then\n\u0001k\nP (t1 , * * * , tn\u22121 ) = det asj+1 \u2212si i,j=0 .\nHere the determinant is of a k +1 by k +1 matrix, and one sets s0 = 0, sk+1 = n, a0 = 1,\nand ai = 0 for i < 0.\nProof. Theorem 4.1 follows from Proposition 2.2 and Theorem 4.2 in [58, Chap. 7], after\nelementary manipulations.\nRemark: It follows from the discussion on [58, p. 140] that if all of the determinants\n(for all n and subsets S) in Theorem 4.1 are non-negative, then a stationary, onedependent process with these ai values exists.\nExample 5. For any n, the sequence with n \u2212 1 ones has k = 0 zeros. The relevant\nmatrix is then 1 by 1 with entry an , giving this probability.\nExample 6. To compute P (0, 0, 0)\n{1, 2, 3}. It follows that\n\uf8ee\n1 a2\n\uf8ef1 1\nP (0, 0, 0) = det \uf8ef\n\uf8f00 1\n0 0\n\none applies the theorem with n = 4 and S =\n\uf8f9\na3 a4\na2 a3 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa = 1 \u2212 3a2 + a22 + 2a3 \u2212 a4 ,\n1 a2 \uf8fb\n1 1\n8\n\n\fas above.\nOur next result expresses the determinant in Theorem 4.1 as a skew-Schur function\nof ribbon (also called rim-hook) type. Background on skew-Schur functions can be found\nin [51, Sec. 1.5]. For further references and recent work, one can consult [3] or [47]. We\nwill use the elementary symmetric functions er in countably many variables defined as\ne0 = 1 and\nX\nx i1 x i2 * * * x ir .\ner =\n1\u2264i1 <i2 <***<ir\n\nFrom [51, p. 20] these are algebraically independent, so there is a homomorphism of the\nring of symmetric functions to R which sends each ei to ai from Theorem 4.1.\nTheorem 4.2. With notation as in Theorem 4.1, let \u03bb and \u03bc be the partitions defined\nby\n\u03bbi = n \u2212 si\u22121 \u2212 k + i \u2212 1 , \u03bci = n \u2212 si \u2212 k + i \u2212 1, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k + 1.\n\nLet \u03bb\u2032 , \u03bc\u2032 denote the transpose partitions of \u03bb and \u03bc and let s\u03bb\u2032 /\u03bc\u2032 denote the corresponding skew-Schur function, obtained by specializing the elementary symmetric functions ei\nto equal ai . Then\nP (t1 , * * * , tn\u22121 ) = s\u03bb\u2032 /\u03bc\u2032 .\n\nProof. First note that the \u03bbi , \u03bci defined above are all non-negative. From Macdonald\n[51, p. 71],\nk+1\ns\u03bb\u2032 /\u03bc\u2032 = det(e\u03bbi \u2212\u03bcj \u2212i+j )i,j=1\n,\n(4.1)\nand er is the rth elementary symmetric function. When each er is specialized to equal\nar , the quantity s\u03bb\u2032 /\u03bc\u2032 becomes\nk+1\ndet(a\u03bbi \u2212\u03bcj \u2212i+j )k+1\ni,j=1 = det(asj \u2212si\u22121 )i,j=1 ,\n\nas desired.\nOne reason why Theorem 4.2 is interesting is that there are non-obvious equalities\nbetween ribbon skew-Schur functions. The paper [3] characterizes when two ribbon\nskew-Schur functions are equal; analogous results for more general skew-Schur functions\nare in [60]. In particular, combining the results of [3] with Theorem 4.2 one immediately\nobtains the fact that a stationary one-dependent process is invariant under time reversal,\ni.e.\nP (t1 , * * * , tn ) = P (tn , * * * , t1 )\nfor all ti . For another proof of invariance under time reversal, see [58, p. 139].\nThe determinantal formulae of Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 suggest that a determinantal\npoint process is lurking nearby. This is indeed the case. In Section 7 (see Corollary 7.3)\nwe prove the following.\nCorollary 4.3. A stationary one-dependent process as in Theorem 4.1 is determinantal\nwith kernel K(x, y) = k(y \u2212 x) with\nX\n\nn\u2208Z\n\nn\n\nk(n)z = \u22121/\n\n9\n\n\u221e\nX\nj=1\n\naj z j .\n\n\fA remarkable development, connecting stationary one-dependent processes to algebra appears in [58, Chap. 7]. They consider a graded algebra A0 \u2295 A1 \u2295 A2 + . . . with\nA0 = k, a ground field, and Ai Aj \u2286 Ai+j . For example, the space k[x] of polynomials\nin one variable has A0 = k, and Ai spanned by xi . They assume that each Ai is a finite\ndimensional vector space of dimension dim(Ai ). The algebra is quadratic if A0 = k,\nthe algebra is generated by elements of A1 , and the relations defining the algebra are\nin A2 . For example, the commutative polynomial ring k[x1 , . . . , xn ] is generated by\nx1 , . . . , xn and the quadratic relations xi xj \u2212 xj xi = 0. Note that algebras need not be\ncommutative.\nA technical growth condition on the dim(Ai ) which we will not explain here yields\nthe Koszul algebras. These include many natural algebras occurring in mathematics\n(see [34] for a survey). As a simple example, consider the commutative polynomial ring\ngenerated by x1 , x2 , . . . , xn with the additional relations xi xj = 0 for (i, j) \u2208 E, with\nE the edge set of an undirected graph on {1, 2, . . . , n} (loops allowed). This is Koszul\n[58, Chap. 2, Cor. 4.3]. Polishchuk and Positselski [58, Chap. 7, Cor. 4.3] prove the\nfollowing remarkable result.\nTheorem 4.4. To every Koszul algebra A one can assign a stationary, one-dependent\nprocess via\nP (X1 = X2 = * * * = Xi\u22121 = 1) =\n\ndim(Ai )\ndim(A1 )i\n\nfor i = 1, 2, . . . .\n\nPart of the reason that Theorem 4.4 is substantive is that the quantities P (X1 =\nX2 = * * * = Xi\u22121 = 1) can not assume arbitrary values; the determinants in Theorem\n4.1 must be non-negative.\nExample 7. Consider the commutative polynomial algebra generated by x1 , x2 , . . . xb\nand the additional relations x2i = 0, 1 \u2264 i \u2264\n\u0001 b. The degree i part Ai is spanned by\nsquare free monomials and has dim(Ai ) = bi , 0 \u2264 i < \u221e. From Fact 2 of Section 2,\nwe see that the associated one-dependent process is precisely the carries process of mod\nb addition from our introduction. Note that since only the dim(Ai ) matter, the algebra\nin this example can be replaced by the exterior algebra generated by x1 , x2 , . . . , xb and\nthe relations xi xj = \u2212xj xi for all i, j.\nExample 8. Consider the commutative polynomial algebra generated by x1 , x2 , . . . , x\u0001b .\nThe degree i part Ai is spanned by monomials of degree i and has dim(Ai ) = b+i\u22121\n.\ni\nFrom Example 2 of Section 2, the associated one-dependent process is precisely the\ncomplement of the carries process of mod b addition. More generally, in Section 7\nwe show that the particle-hole involution of a (perhaps non-stationary) one-dependent\nprocess with respect to any subset is one-dependent.\nExample 9. A PBW algebra is an algebra of the form\nk[x1 , * * * , xn ]/hxi xj : (i, j) \u2208 S \u2282 [1, n]2 i,\nwhere the variables x1 , * * * , xn do not commute. Here it is useful to think of S as\na directed graph with vertex set {1, * * * , n}, loops allowed. From [58, p. 84], PBW\nalgebras are Koszul. As noted in [58, Chap. 7, Prop. 5.1], the one-dependent process\n10\n\n\fassociated to a PBW algebra can be described as follows: pick U1 , U2 , * * * i.i.d. in\n{1, * * * , n} and let Xi = h(Ui , Ui+1 ), where h(i, j) = 0 if and only if (i, j) \u2208 S. Indeed,\nthe dimensions satisfy dim(A0 ) = 1, dim(A1 ) = n, dim(Ai ) =number of paths of length\ni \u2212 1 in the complement of S, and so the chance of i \u2212 1 consecutive 1's in the point\nprocess is equal to dim(Ai )/ dim(A1 )i .\nThe above argument shows that PBW algebras give rise to two-block-factor processes. In fact they are dense in the set of all two-block factors [58, Chap. 7, Prop. 5.2].\nFor a generalization of these PBW processes, as well as a simple argument that they\nare determinantal, see Remark 5 after Theorem 5.3.\nExample 10. Consider 2n points x1 , x2 , . . . , x2n in general position in projective space\nPn . The coordinate ring of this projective variety is known to be Koszul [58, p. 42] with\ndim(A0 ) = 1, dim(A1 ) = n + 1, dim(Ai ) = 2n for i \u2265 2. Thus P (X1 = X2 = * * * =\nXi\u22121 = 1) = 2n/(n + 1)i defines a one-dependent process. When n = 1, this is fair coin\ntossing. When n = 3, it is the carries process for multiplying quaternions introduced in\nSection 6.\nFor general n, these one-dependent processes can be described as follows (and illustrates what one might consider to be a \"probabilistic\" description). Let {1, 2, * * * , n}\nbe ordered cyclically and let \u2217 be another symbol. Choose Ui i.i.d. in {\u2217, 1, * * * , n}. Let\nXi = h(Ui , Ui+1 ) where h(\u2217, x) = 0 for all x, h(x, \u2217) = 1 = h(i, i + 1) for x 6= \u2217, and\nh(i, j) = 0 otherwise. To see that this works, note that P (X1 = 1) = 2n/(n + 1)2 , since\none has to choose x different from \u2217 first and then \u2217 or x + 1 next. Similarly, for the\nchance of i \u2212 1 1's in a row, the first choice can be anything but \u2217, then the next i \u2212 2\nchoices are determined and the last can be one of two.\nWe are certain that natural Koszul algebras will lead to natural point processes. We\nnote further that [58, Sec. 7.6] shows how natural operations on algebras preserve the\nKoszul property. These include the operations of union and complements that we work\nwith in Section 7.\n\n5\n\nDescents in permutations\n\nA permutation \u03c3 \u2208 Sn , the symmetric group, has a descent at i if \u03c3(i) > \u03c3(i + 1). The\nset of such i forms the descent set D(\u03c3). If the base b in previous sections is large and\nn stays fixed, a string of n digits will have no repeated values and the descent theory of\nSection 2 and Section 3 above becomes descent theory for random permutations. This\nis a venerable subject. Stanley [66, 68] reviews the basics. Some modern highlights\nare Solomon's descent algebra [64], the connections with the free Lie algebra [36, 61],\nGessel's theory of enumerating permutations by descents and cycle structure [22, 37],\nquasi-symmetric functions and the theory of riffle shuffling [35, 70]. Any Coxeter group\nhas its own descent theory [64]. There is some indication that arithmetic carries can be\ncarried over [20].\nThis section introduces three examples where the descent set can be shown to be\na one-dependent determinantal point process: uniform choice of permutations, nonuniform choice from the Mallows model, and independent trials. Then it shows that the\nclosely related notion of the connectivity set of a permutation also yields a determinantal\nprocess. Finally, connections with binomial posets are mentioned.\n\n11\n\n\fExample 11. The descent set of a uniformly chosen permutation. Consider\nthe formula of Section 2 Fact 5 for the chance that a random b-ary string of length\n\u0001 bn\na\nhas descents exactly at S \u2286 [n \u2212 1]. Passing to the limit, as b \u0580 \u221e using a+b\u22121\n\u223c a!\nb\u22121\ngives a classical formula for the chance that a uniformly chosen \u03c3 \u2208 Sn has descents\nexactly at S:\n\u0002 \u000e\n\u0003\nPn (D(\u03c3) = S) = det 1 (sj+1 \u2212 si )! .\n(5.1)\n\nFor S = 1 \u2264 s1 < s2 < * * * < sk \u2264 n \u2212 1, the determinant is of a (k + 1) \u00d7 (k + 1) matrix\nwith (i, j) entry 1/(sj+1 \u2212 si )!, (i, j) \u2208 [0, k] \u00d7 [0, k] and s0 = 0, sk+1 = n. This formula\nis originally due to MacMahon [52]. See Stanley [67, p. 69] or Gessel and Viennot [38]\nfor modern proofs.\n\nEquation (5.1) allows us to see that the descent set of a uniformly random permutation, treated as a point process, is determinantal. The proof follows from (5.1) and\nCorollary 7.6 in Section 7.\nTheorem 5.1. There exists a stationary point process on Z, call it P , such that its\nrestriction to any interval of length n \u2212 1 coincides with Pn of (5.1). The process P is\none-dependent and determinantal. Its correlation kernel K(x, y) = k(y \u2212 x) with\nX\n\nk(m)z m =\n\nm\u2208Z\n\n1\n.\n1 \u2212 ez\n\n(5.2)\n\nRemarks.\n1. Theorem 5.1 can also be seen by passing to the limit in Theorem 3.1. Replacing t\nin the generating function 1/(1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 t)b ) by \u2212z/b and letting b \u0580 \u221e gives (5.2).\nP\nn\n2. The Bernoulli numbers Bn are defined by z/(ez \u2212 1) = \u221e\nn=0 Bn z /n!. These are\nvery well-studied.

The correlation functions of P (and Pn ) can be computed explicitly by passage to\nthe limit from Fact 5 of Section 2. Let A = A1 \u222a A2 \u222a * * * \u222a Ak be a decomposition\nof the finite set A \u2286 Z into disjoint blocks of adjacent integers. If |Ai | = ai ,\n\u03c1(A) =\n\nk\nY\ni=1\n\n12\n\n1\n.\n(ai + 1)!\n\n\f5. For any n = 1, 2, . . . , let Kn (i, j) = k(j \u2212 i) be the n \u00d7 n top left corner block of\nK. Let d(\u03c0) denote the number of descents of \u03c0 and let\nX\nxd(\u03c0)\nAn+1 =\n\u03c0\u2208Sn+1\n\nbe the (n+1)st Eulerian polynomial (see e.g., [67, p. 22]). Then item (c) preceding\nTheorem 3.1 yields that\nAn+1 (x) = det (I + (x \u2212 1)Kn ) (n + 1)!\nIt is known [14, p. 292] that An+1 (x) has all real zeros \u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . . , \u03b1n . From the\ndevelopment in Section 3, Nn+1 , the number of descents in a random permutation\nfrom Sn+1 , is the sum of n independent Bernoulli random variables with success\nrates (1 \u2212 \u03b1j )\u22121 , 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n.

Chebikin [11] studied the \"alternating descent set\" A(\u03c3) of a random permutation,\ndefined as the set of positions at which the permutation has an alternating descent,\nthat is an ordinary descent if i is odd, or an ascent if i is even. Combining Lemma\n2.3.1 of [11] with the argument used to prove (5.1), one obtains that for |S| = k,\nPn (A(\u03c3) = S) = det[Esj+1 \u2212si /(sj+1 \u2212 si )!]ki,j=0 ,\nP\nwhere En is the nth Euler number defined by n\u22650 En z n /n! = tan(z) + sec(z),\nand s0 = 0, sk+1 = n. Applying our Theorem 7.5 in Section 7, it follows that\nthat Pn is obtained by restricting to any interval of length n \u2212 1 the stationary,\none-dependent, determinantal process with correlation kernel K(x, y) = k(y \u2212 x)\nwith\nX\n1\n.\nk(m)z m =\n1 \u2212 (tan(z) + sec(z))\u22121\nm\u2208Z\n\n7. Modern combinatorics suggests a host of potential generalizations of Theorem 5.1.\nLet P be a partial order on [n]. A linear extension of P is a permutation \u03c3 \u2208 Sn\nsuch that if i is less than j according to P , then \u03c3(i) < \u03c3(j). Let L(P ) denote the\nset of linear extensions of P . For each \u03c3 \u2208 L(P ), let\nD(\u03c3) = {i : \u03c3(i) > \u03c3(i + 1)},\n\nthe descent set of \u03c3,\n\n\u2227(\u03c3) = {i : \u03c3(i \u2212 1) < \u03c3(i) > \u03c3(i + 1)},\n\nthe peak set of \u03c3.\n\nChoosing \u03c3 uniformly in L(P ) gives two point processes. This section has focused\non ordinary descents, that is, P is the trivial poset with no restrictions. There\nare many indications that \"natural\" posets will give rise to determinantal point\nprocesses. For background and first results, see Brenti [8] or Stembridge [72].\n13\n\n\f8. Finally, we mention that it would be interesting to find analogs of Theorem 5.1 for\nother Coxeter groups. For the hyperoctahedral group Bn consisting of the 2n n!\nsigned permutations, descents can be defined using the linear ordering\n1 < 2 < * * * < n < \u2212n < * * * < \u22122 < \u22121.\nSay that\n(a) \u03c3 has a descent at position i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1) if \u03c3(i) > \u03c3(i + 1).\n\n(b) \u03c3 has a descent at position n if \u03c3(n) < 0.\n\nFor example, \u22124 \u22121 3 2 5 \u2208 B3 has descent set {2, 3, 5}. Reiner [59] shows that the\nchance that a random element of Bn has descent set {s1 , * * * , sr } \u2286 {1, 2, * * * , n}\nis det(a(i, j))ri,j=0 where\n(\n1\nif 0 \u2264 j \u2264 r \u2212 1\n(sj+1 \u2212si )!\na(i, j) =\n1\nif j = r\n2n\u2212si (n\u2212s )!\ni\n\nHere s0 = 0. Theorem 7.5 in Section 7 shows that the resulting processes is\ndeterminantal (but not stationary).\nExample 12. Descents from non-uniform distributions on permutations. In\na variety of applications, non-uniform distributions are used on permutations. A widely\nused model is\nP\u03b8 (\u03c3) = Z \u22121 \u03b8 d(\u03c3,\u03c30 ) ,\n\u03c3 \u2208 Sn .\n(5.3)\nHere, 0 < \u03b8 \u2264 1 is a fixed concentration P\nparameter, \u03c30 \u2208 Sn is a fixed location parameter,\nd(\u03c3,\u03c30 ) is the normalizing constant. These\nd(\u03c3, \u03c30 ) is a metric on Sn and Z =\n\u03c3\u03b8\nare called \"Mallows models through the metric d.\" When \u03b8 = 1, P1 is the uniform\ndistribution. For 0 < \u03b8 < 1, P\u03b8 is largest at \u03c30 and falls off as \u03c3 moves away from \u03c30 .\nSee [15], [23] or [54] for background and references.\nPerhaps the most widely used metric is\nd(\u03c3, \u03c30 ) = minimum number of pairwise adjacent transpositions\nto bring \u03c3 to \u03c30 ,\n\u0001\n= I \u03c3\u03c30\u22121 , the number of inversions in \u03c3\u03c30\u22121 .\n\n(5.4)\n\nThis is called \"Kendall's tau\" in the statistics literature. References, extensions and\nproperties are in [19, Sect. 4], [31], [53]. We mention that the normalizing constant of\nQ\ni \u22121\n[67, p. 21].\nthe Mallows model through Kendall's tau is given by Z = ni=1 \u03b8\u03b8\u22121\nWith \u03b8, \u03c30 and d fixed, one may ask any of the usual questions of applied probability\nand enumerative combinatorics: \"Picking a permutation randomly from P\u03b8 (*), what is\nthe distribution of the cycle structure, longest increasing subsequence, . . . ?\" For general\nmetrics, these are open research problems. Even the algorithmic task of sampling from\nP\u03b8 leads to difficult problems. See [21] or [19].\nFor Mallows model P\u03b8 through Kendall's tau (5.4) and \u03c30 = id, we show that the\ndescent set of \u03c3, D(\u03c3) = {i : \u03c3(i + 1) < \u03c3(i)} forms a determinantal point process with\ni \u22121\nand\nsimple properties. In what follows we use the q-analog notation that iq = qq\u22121\nQn\nn!q = i=1 iq , and take \u03b8 = q as is conventional in combinatorial work in the subject.\n14\n\n\fProposition 5.2. Let Pq (0 < q < 1) be Mallows model through Kendall's tau (5.3),\n(5.4) on Sn .\n(a) The chance that a random permutation chosen from P\u03b8 has descent set s1 < s2 <\n* * * < sk is\n\u0015k\n\u0014\n1\n,\ndet\n(sj+1 \u2212 si )!q i,j=0\nwith s0 = 0 and sk+1 = n.\n(b) The point process associated to D(\u03c3) is stationary, one-dependent, and determinantal with kernel K(x, y) = k(y \u2212 x), where\nX\n\nk(m)z m =\n\nm\u2208Z\n\n1\n1\u2212\n\nP\u221e\n\nm=0 z\n\nm\n\n\u000e\n\nm!q\n\n\u0001\u22121 .\n\nk+1\n(c) The chance of finding k descents in a row is q ( 2 ) /(k + 1)!q . In particular, the\nchance of a descent at any given location ish q/(q + 1). The number\nof descents\ni\n(q 2 \u2212q+1)n\u2212q 2 +3q\u22121\n(n\u22121)q\n. Normalized by\nhas mean \u03bc(n, q) = q+1 and variance q\n(q 2 +q+1)(q+1)2\nits mean and variance, the number of descents has a limiting standard normal\ndistribution.\n\nProof. Part (a) of Proposition 5.2 follows from Stanley [67, Ex. 2.2.5]. Part (b) follows\nfrom Corollary 7.6 in Section 7 and elementary calculations. To compute the chance of\nk consecutive descents, note by stationarity that this is the chance of the permutation\nk+1\n\u03c3(i) = k+2\u2212i in Sk+1 under the Pq measure on Sk+1 . This probability is q ( 2 ) /(k+1)!q ,\nas needed. One calculates from part (b) that\nk(\u22121) = 1, k(0) =\n\nq2\nq\n, k(1) =\n.\nq+1\n(q + 1)2 (q 2 + q + 1)\n\nRecall from the remarks preceding Theorem 3.1 that\nE(xN ) = det (I + (x \u2212 1)K) ,\nwhere N is the total number of particles. Thus\nE(|D(\u03c3)|) = tr(Kn\u22121 ) = (n \u2212 1)k(0),\n2\nV ar(|D(\u03c3)|) = tr(Kn\u22121 \u2212 Kn\u22121\n) = (n \u2212 1)k(0) \u2212 (n \u2212 1)k(0)2 \u2212 2(n \u2212 2)k(1)k(\u22121),\n\nand the proof of part (c) is complete.\nRemarks.\n1. From part (c), the correlation functions are given explicitly, just as in remark 4\nfollowing Theorem 5.1.\n2. It would be interesting to have a direct combinatorial proof of the one-dependence\nin Proposition 5.2.\n\n15\n\n\fExample 13. Descents for independent trials The carries in the carries process\nhave an equivalent description in terms of descents in an independent and uniform\nsequence. In this example we generalize to descents in a sequence Y1 , Y2 , . . . , Yn with\nYi independent and identically distributed with P (Y1 =Pj) = pj . Here 0 \u2264 j \u2264 b \u2212 1\nto match previous sections (and of course 0 \u2264 pj \u2264 1, pj = 1), but in fact b = \u221e\ncan be allowed. The descents are related to the order statistics for discrete random\nvariables [2, 29] but we have not seen this problem previously treated in the probability\nor statistics literature. Of course, if Yi are independent and identically distributed from\na continuous distribution, the descent theory is the same as the descent theory for a\nrandom permutation.\nIt is useful to have the complete homogeneous symmetric functions\nX\nhk (x1 , x2 , . . . , xm ) =\nx i1 x i2 . . . x ik .\n1\u2264i1 \u2264***\u2264ik \u2264m\n\nTheorem 5.3. If Y1 , Y2 , . . . , Yn are independent with common probability P (Y1 = j) =\npj , 0 \u2264 j \u2264 b \u2212 1, the descents in Y1 , Y2 , . . . , Yn form a stationary one-dependent point\nprocess on [n \u2212 1] with\n\u0001\nwith s0 = 0, sk+1 = n,\nPn (S) = det hsj+1 \u2212si 0\u2264i,j\u2264k\n\nfor S = {s1 < s2 < * * * < sk }. The hj are evaluated\nthis\nP at p0 , . . . , lpb\u22121 . Moreover,\n1\nQ\n.\nk(l)z\n=\nprocess is determinantal with K(i, j) = k(j \u2212 i) and \u221e\nb\u22121\nl=\u2212\u221e\n1\u2212\n\ni=0 (1\u2212pi z)\n\nProof. Let \u03b1n (S) = Pn (des(Y1 , Y2 , . . . , Yn ) \u2286 S) = hs1 hs2 \u2212s1 . . . hn\u2212sk . The determinant formula follows from the argument for P\nFact 5 in Section\nCorollary 7.6\nQb\u221212. Now, \u22121\n\u221e\n1\nl =\nh\nz\n(1\n\u2212\np\nz)\nfrom e.g.,\n,\nwith\n\u00ea(z)\n=\nimplies that k\u0302(z) = 1\u2212\u00ea(z)\n\u22121\ni\nl=0 l\ni=0\nMacdonald [51, p. 21].\nRemarks.\n1\n1. Setting pi = 1/b, k\u0302(z) = 1\u2212(1\u2212z/b)\nb . This is equivalent to our result in Theorem\n3.1, by changing variable z to z/b \u2192 t, which doesn't change correlations.\n\n2. From the theorem, the associated point process is one-dependent. If Xi = 1 or 0\nas there is a descent at i or not, then clearly\nP (X1 = X2 = * * * = Xi = 1) = ei+1 (p0 , * * * , pb\u22121 ),\nP\nwhere er (x1 , * * * , xm ) = 1\u2264i1 <***<ir \u2264m xi1 xi2 * * * xim is the rth elementary symmetric function. For example,\n1 1X 2\npi ,\n\u2212\n2 2\ni\n1 1X 2 1X 3\n= 1) = \u2212\npi +\npi .\n6 2\n3\n\nP (Xi = 1) =\nP (Xi = Xi+1\n\ni\n\ni\n\nThis allows a straightforward formulation (and proof) of the central limit theorem\nfor the number of descents. As in Section 2, simple expressions for the correlation\nfunctions are available in terms of P (X1 = X2 = * * * = Xi = 1).\n16\n\n\f3. As we show in Corollary 7.7, one can express Pn (S) as a skew-Schur function of\nribbon type. For special choices of the pi 's, this symmetric function interpretation\nP\nmay facilitate computation. For example, [51, Sect. 1.5] gives s\u03bb/\u03bc = \u03bd c\u03bb\u03bc\u03bd s\u03bd\nwith c\u03bb\u03bc\u03bd the Littlewood\u2013Richardson coefficients and s\u03bd the Schur function. If\npi = zq i (i = 0, 1, * * * , b \u2212 1, z a normalizing constant), then s\u03bd is non-0 only if \u03bd\nhas length \u2264 b, in which case\ns\u03bd = z |\u03bd| q n(\u03bd)\n\nY 1 \u2212 q b+c(x)\n;\n1 \u2212 q h(x)\nx\u2208\u03bd\n\nsee Macdonald [51, p. 44] for an explanation of notation.\n4. Coming back to carries, if a column of numbers is chosen independently on\n{0, 1, . . . , b \u2212 1} from common distribution {pi }b\u22121\ni=0 , the remainder column after\naddition evolves as a Markov chain with starting distribution {pi } and transition\nmatrix P (i, j) = pj\u2212i (indices mod b). This is a circulant with known eigenvalues\nand eigenvectors. We do not know the distribution of carries.\n5. There is a sweeping generalization of this example which leads to a large collection of determinantal point processes. Let R be an arbitrary subset of [N ] \u00d7\n[N ]. Fix a probability distribution \u03b81 , \u03b82 , . . . , \u03b8N on [N ]. A point process Pn\non [n \u001a\n\u2212 1] arises as follows: pick Y1 , Y2 , . . . , Yn independently from {\u03b8i }. Let\nXi =\n\n1\n0\n\nif (Yi , Yi+1 ) \u2208\n/R\n,\notherwise\n\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1. Let S = {i : Xi = 1}. Using essentially\n\nthe arguments above, it is proved in Brenti [8, Th. 7.32] that\nik\nh\nfor S = {s1 < * * * < sk }, s0 = 0, sk+1 = n,\nPn (S) = det hR\nsj+1 \u2212si\ni,j=0\n\nR\nR\nR\nwhere hR\nj = hj (\u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8N ) := Pj (\u2205). Here as usual, h0 = 1, hj = 0 for j < 0.\nThis falls into the domain of Theorem 7.5 andPits corollary. It follows that Pn is\n1\nl\n\"\n\"\ndeterminantal with kernel K(i, j) = k(j \u2212 i),\nl\u2208Z k(l)z = 1\u2212 P\u221e hR z j \u22121 .\n( j=0 j )\n\u001a\n1 if i \u2264 j\n. We are certain that\nOur examples are the special case R(i, j) =\n\n0\n\notherwise\n\nthere are many other interesting cases.\n\nExample 14. Connectivity set of a permutation.\nStanley [71] studied a \"dual\" notion to the descent set of a permutation, which he\ncalled the connectivity set. For \u03c3 \u2208 Sn , the connectivity set C(\u03c3) is defined as the set\nof i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1, such that \u03c3 \u2208 S1,*** ,i \u00d7 Si+1,*** ,n . For example, the permutation\n\u03c3 = 3 1 2 5 4 6 satisfies C(\u03c3) = {3, 5}. The connectivity set also arises in the analysis\nof quicksort, where it is called the set of splitters of a permutation [74, Sec. 2.2].\nWe will prove that the connectivity set of a random element of Sn is a determinantal\npoint process and determine its correlation kernel. For this the following two facts are\nhelpful:\n1. A permutation \u03c3 \u2208 Sn is called indecomposable or connected if C(\u03c3) = \u2205. Comtet\n[14, Exer.

Let C(\u03c3) denote the connectivity set of a permutation \u03c3 chosen uniformly at random from Sn . The point process corresponding to C(\u03c3) \u222a {0, n} is determinantal, with state space {0, * * * , n} and correlation kernel K(x, y) satisfying\nK(0, y) = 1\nK(n, y) = \u03b4n,y\nK(x, y) = n1\n(x )\n1\nK(x, y) = n1 \u2212 n\u2212y\n(x) (n\u2212x)\n\nall y\nall y\n0, n 6= x \u2264 y\n0, n 6= x > y\n\nNote that in the statement of the theorem, 0, n are always points of the process.\nProof. The first step is to observe that C(\u03c3) \u222a {0, n} can be obtained as a trajectory of\na certain Markov chain, started at 0, with transition probabilities\nP (i, j) =\n\n(n \u2212 j)!f (j \u2212 i)\n.\n(n \u2212 i)!\n\n(5.7)\n\nHere we take f (0) = 0, so P (i, i) = 0 for all i. To prove (5.7), note that C(\u03c3) =\n{i1 , * * * , ik } if and only if the following events E1 , * * * , Ek+1 occur:\n\u2022 E1 : {\u03c0(1), * * * , \u03c0(i1 )} = {1, * * * , i1 } and \u03c0 restricted to {1, * * * , i1 } is indecomposable.\n\u2022 E2 : {\u03c0(i1 + 1), * * * , \u03c0(i2 )} = {i1 + 1, * * * , i2 } and \u03c0 restricted to {i1 + 1, * * * , i2 } is\nindecomposable.\n\u2022 ***\n\u2022 Ek+1 : {\u03c0(ik + 1), * * * , \u03c0(n)} = {ik + 1, * * * , n} and \u03c0 restricted to {ik + 1, * * * , n}\nis indecomposable.\nLetting f (n) denote the number of indecomposable permutations in Sn , the probability\n1 )(n\u2212i2 )!\n1 )!\n. The probability of E2 given E1 is f (i2 \u2212i\nof E1 is clearly f (i1 )(n\u2212i\nand the\nn!\n(n\u2212i1 )!\n2 )(n\u2212i3 )!\n, etc., as claimed.\nprobability of E3 given E1 , E2 is f (i3 \u2212i\n(n\u2212i2 )!\nNow [4, Thm. 1.1] implies that the point process on C(\u03c3) \u222a {0, n} is determinantal\nwith correlation kernel\n\nK(x, y) = \u03b40,x + Q(0, x) \u2212 Q(y, x)\nwhere\nQ = P + P2 + P3 + *** .\n\n18\n\n(5.8)\n\n\fTo compute Q, let [xr ]g(x) denote the coefficient of xr in a series g(x), and note that\nX\nP 2 (i, j) =\nP (i, l)P (l, j)\nl\n\nX (n \u2212 l)!f (l \u2212 i) (n \u2212 j)!f (j \u2212 l)\n\n=\n\n(n \u2212 i)!\n\nl\n\n(n \u2212 l)!\n\n1\n(n \u2212 j)! j\u2212i\n[x ] 1 \u2212 P\nn\n(n \u2212 i)!\nn\u22650 n!x\n\n=\n\n!2\n\n.\n\nThe last equality used (5.5). A similar computation shows that\n!r\n1\n(n\n\u2212\nj)!\n[xj\u2212i ] 1 \u2212 P\nP r (i, j) =\n,\nn\n(n \u2212 i)!\nn\u22650 n!x\nand thus\n\nQ(i, j) =\n\n\u0010\n\n(n \u2212 j)! j\u2212i 1 \u2212\n[x ] \u0010P\n(n \u2212 i)!\n\nP\n\nn\u22650\n\n=\n\nThus Q(i, j) = 1/\n(5.8).\n\nn\u2212i \u0001\nn\u2212j\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\u0011\n\n1\n\nn!xn\n\u0011\u22121\nn!xn\n\nn\u22650\n\n\uf8f6\n(n \u2212 j)! j\u2212i \uf8edX\nn!xn \uf8f8 .\n[x ]\n(n \u2212 i)!\nn\u22651\n\nif i < j, and is 0 otherwise. The theorem follows from this and\n\nRemarks.\n1. The connectivity set C(\u03c3) is a simple example of a determinantal process which\n, P (3 \u2208 C(\u03c3)) =\nis not one-dependent. Indeed, from (5.6), P (1 \u2208 C(\u03c3)) = 1!(n\u22121)!\nn!\n1!2!(n\u22123)!\n3!(n\u22123)!\n, and P (1, 3 \u2208 C(\u03c3)) =\n6= P (1 \u2208 C(\u03c3))P (3 \u2208 C(\u03c3)).\nn!\nn!\n2. Unlike the other point processes considered in this paper, the expected number of\npoints tends to 0 as n \u2192 \u221e. Indeed, applying (5.6) gives that\nE|C(\u03c3)| =\n\nn\u22121\nX\ni=1\n\nP (i \u2208 C(\u03c3)) =\n\nas n \u2192 \u221e.\n\nn\u22121\nX\ni=1\n\n1\nn\u0001 \u2192 0\ni\n\nBinomial posets\nIn Doubilet\u2013Rota\u2013Stanley [24], binomial posets were introduced as a unifying mechanism to \"explain\" the many forms of generating functions that appear in enumerative\ncombinatorics. Briefly, X is a binomial poset if for every interval [x, y], the length of all\nmaximal chains is the same (say nxy ) and the number of maximal chains in an interval\nof length n does not depend on the particular interval. This number B(n) is called\nthe factorial function. For the usual Boolean algebra of subsets, B(n) = n!. For the\n19\n\n\fsubspaces of a vector space over a finite field, B(n) = n!q (q-factorial). There are many\nfurther examples.\nStanley [66] has shown that many enumerative formulae generalize neatly to the\nsetting of binomial posets. Some of these developments give new determinantal point\nprocesses. Here is an example.\nExample 15. (union of descent sets)\nTheorem 5.5. Pick \u03c31 , \u03c32 , . . . , \u03c3n independently from Mallows model through Kendall's\ntau (5.3) on the symmetric group Sn . Let S = {s1 < * * * < sk } be the union of their\ndescent sets. Then\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n,\nPn (S) = det\n((sj+1 \u2212 si )!q )r\n\nwhere s0 = 0, sk+1 = n. The associated point process is stationary, one-dependent,\nand\nP\n1\nl /(l! )r .\ndeterminantal with K(x, y) = k(y \u2212 x) for k\u0302(z) = 1\u22121/\u00ea(z)\nwhere \u00ea(z) = \u221e\nz\nq\nl=0\n\nProof. The formula for Pn (S) is Corollary 3.2 of [66], so the theorem follows from one\nof our main results proved in Section 7 (Corollary 7.6).\n\u221a\nWhen q = 1 and r = 2, \u00ea(z) = I0 (2 z), the classical modified Bessel function.\nFeller [30, \u00a7II.7] develops a host of connections with stochastic processes.\nRemark. The intersection of two independent point processes with correlation functions\n\u03c11 (A), \u03c12 (A) is a point process with correlation function \u03c11 (A)\u03c12 (A). If both processes\nare determinantal, this is a product of determinants, but in general the intersection\nor union of determinantal processes is not determinantal. In Subsection 7.1, we show\nthat all one-dependent processes are determinantal. Since the intersection of descent\nsets of independent permutations is one-dependent, and taking complements preserves\none-dependence, this gives another proof that the union process in Theorem 5.5 is\ndeterminantal.\n\nWe have not pursued other examples but again believe there is much else to be\ndiscovered.\n\n6\n\nMore general carries\n\nConsider the quaternions Q8 = {\u00b11, \u00b1i, \u00b1j, \u00b1k}. The center Z of Q8 is {\u00b11}. Choose\ncoset representatives X = {1, i, j, k} for Z in Q8 so any element can be uniquely represented as g = zx. The coset representatives are multiplied by the familiar rule k y i y\nj y k so ij = k and kj = \u2212i, etc. If we multiply g1 g2 . . . gk = (z1 x1 )(z2 x2 ) . . . (zk xk ),\nthe zi \u2208 {\u00b11} can all be moved to the left and we must multiply x1 x2 * * * * * xk , keeping\ntrack of the \"carries\", here \u00b11. Evidently, if {gi } are chosen uniformly at random in\nQ8 , both {zi } and {xi } are independent and uniform in Z and X. Thus we have the\nfollowing problem: choose X1 , X2 , . . . , Xk uniformly in X and multiply as X1 , X1 X2 ,\n(X1 X2 )X3 , . . . ,\nX1\nX2\nX3\n..\n.\nXk\n20\n\n\fThis gives a process of remainders and carries as in Section 1.\nExample 16.\nk\nk\ni\ni\nk\nj\nk\ni\n\n* k\n1\n* i\n1\n* k\n* i\n* j\nk\n\ngives (\u22121)5 k = \u2212k.\n\nIt is almost obvious that the carries form a stationary, one-dependent, two-block process\nwith P (i \u2212 1 ones in a row) = 46i , 2 \u2264 i < \u221e. Further, the remainders in the second\ncolumn are independent and uniform on {1, i, j, k} and there is a simple \"descent\" rule\nwhich determines the joint law of the dots (Example 18 below).\nWe also mention, by comparison with Example 10 in Section 4, that the carries\nprocess for the quaternions is the same point process that arises from the coordinate\nring of 6 generic points in projective space P3 .\nOne natural generalization where all goes through is to consider a finite group G\nand a normal subgroup N contained in the center of the group. The factor group\nF = G/N has elements labeled 1, \u03c3, \u03c4, . . . . We may choose coset representatives t(1) =\n1, t(\u03c3), t(\u03c4 ), . . . and any g = nt(\u03c3), uniquely. While sometimes t(\u03c3)t(\u03c4 ) = t(\u03c3\u03c4 ), in\nmany cases this fails; but we may choose correction factors f (\u03c3, \u03c4 ) in N (often called\na \"factor set\") so that t(\u03c3)t(\u03c4 ) = t(\u03c3\u03c4 )f (\u03c3, \u03c4 ). Once t(\u03c3) are chosen, the f (\u03c3, \u03c4 ) are\nforced.\nExample 17. If G = C100 , N = C10 (thought of as a subgroup {0, 10, 20, . . . , 90}),\nthe natural choice of coset representatives for G/N \u223c\n= {0, 1, . . . , 9} is t(i) = i \u2208 G. Of\ncourse,\n(\n1 if i + j \u2265 10\nt(i) + t(j) = t(i + j) + f (i, j),\nwith f (i, j) =\n0 if 0 \u2264 i + j < 10.\nIt is natural to ask if the choice of cosets matters. To see that it can, consider C10 in\nC100 and choose coset representatives as 0, 11, 22, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49. The sum of\n11 and 22 requires a carry of 90.\nA lovely exposition of carries as cocycles is in [42].\nIf g = nt(\u03c3) is chosen uniformly at random, then n and t(\u03c3) are independent and\nuniform. Multiplying a sequence of gi = ni ti can be done by first multiplying the ti ,\nkeeping track of the carries, and then multiplying the ni and carries in any order. Of\ncourse, here the carries are in N , not necessarily binary.\nGiven t1 , t2 , . . . , tk , we may form a two-column array with ti in the first column,\nthe successive remainders r1 , r2 , . . . rk in the second column and \"carries\" f1 , f2 , . . . fk\u22121\n(elements in N ) placed in between.\nLemma 6.1. If coset representatives ti , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k, are chosen uniformly, then\n1. the remainder process ri , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k, is uniform and independent, and\n21\n\n\f2. the carries fi , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k \u2212 1, form a stationary, one-dependent, two-block factor.\nProof.\n1. Since r1 = t1 , r1 is uniform. Successive ri are formed by multiplying ri\u22121 by\nti . There is a unique choice of ti giving ri , so ri is uniform and independent of\nr1 , . . . , ri\u22121 .\n2. Consider two successive remainders and the unique t giving rise to them:\nti\n\nri\u22121\nri\n\nSince ti is uniquely determined, ri\u22121 ti = ri f (ri\u22121 , ti ) is uniquely determined. It\nfollows that the fi process is a two-block process: generate r1 , r2 . . . uniformly\nand independently, set fi = h(ri , ri+1 ), with h(r, r \u2032 ) = f (r, t) where r \u22121 r \u2032 \u2208\ntN determines t uniquely. Because two-block processes are one-dependent, this\ncompletes the proof.\nCorollary 6.2. With the notation of the lemma, define a binary process B1 , . . . , Bk\u22121\nas\n(\n1 if fi 6= id\nBi =\n0 if fi = id.\nThen {Bi } is a stationary, one-dependent, two-block factor.\nExample 18. As in Example 16, let G = Q8 , N = {\u00b11}, F = G/N \u223c\n= C2 \u00d7 C2 .\nThe natural choice of coset representatives {1, i, j, k} gives rise to the following twoblock representation: choose U1 , U2 , . . . uniformly and independently in {1, i, j, k}. Let\nBi = h(Ui , Ui+1 ) with h(1, x) = 1 (all x), h(x, 1) = \u22121(x 6= 1), h(i, j) = h(j, k) =\nh(k, i) = \u22121, h(i, k) = h(k, j) = h(j, i) = 1, h(x, x) = 1, (x 6= 1).\nExample 19. (dihedral group) Let D8 = hx, y : x2 = y 2 = (xy)4 = 1i. If z = xy, this\n8-element group has center N = {1, z 2 = \u22121}. Choosing coset representatives 1, x, y, z,\nthe cosets multiply as\n1 x y z\n1\nx\ny\nz\n\n1 x y z\nx 1 z y\ny \u2212z 1 \u2212x\nz \u2212y x \u22121\n\nFrom this, elementary manipulations show that P (i ones in a row) = 1/4i . Thus, the\ncarries process is independent with P (Bi = 1) = 1/4, P (Bi = 0) = 3/4 for all i.\nWe mention that D8 can also be represented as the extension of the normal subgroup\nC4 by the factor group C2 . Here, coset representatives for C4 can be chosen so that\nthere are no carries (i.e. the extension \"splits\").\nExample 20. (extensions of C2 by Cm ) A central extension of N = C2 by Cm is abelian.\nIt follows that when m is odd, G = C2m is the only central extension of N = C2 by Cm ,\nand when m is even, there are two central extensions C2 \u00d7 Cm and C2m . The extension\n22\n\n\fC2 \u00d7Cm splits and choosing {(0, i), 0 \u2264 i \u2264 m\u22121} as the coset representatives, there are\nno carries. For C2m , with C2 \u223c\n= {0, m}, choose coset representatives 0, 1, 2, . . . , m \u2212 1.\nThus\n(\n1 if i + j \u2265 m\nf (i, j) =\n0 if 0 \u2264 i + j < m.\n\nAs for usual addition, there is a carry if and only if there is a descent in the remainder\ncolumn. Thus\nm\u0001\nP (B1 = B2 = * * * = Bi\u22121 = 1) =\n\ni\n\nmi\n\n.\n\nExample 21. Let G = C2 \u00d7 C2 \u00d7 C2 and let N = {(0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1)}. With coset\nrepresentatives (0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (1, 1, 0), there are never carries, but with coset\nrepresentatives (0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1), there are carries. This example shows\nthat the one-dependent process B1 , B2 , * * * depends not only on G and N , but also on\nthe choice of coset representatives.\nWe have not embarked on a systematic study of carries for finite groups and believe\nthat there is much more to do. We do note that by a result in the next section (Theorem\n7.1), the above processes, being one-dependent, are determinantal.\nThe basic carries argument works for infinite groups as well. Let G be a locally\ncompact group and H a closed normal subgroup. Suppose that H is in the center of\nG and that G/H is compact. Choose coset representatives t(\u03c3) \u2208 G for \u03c3 \u2208 G/H.\nAs in the finite case, these define factor sets f (\u03c3, \u03c4 ) by t(\u03c3)t(\u03c4 ) = t(\u03c3\u03c4 )f (\u03c3, \u03c4 ). Write\ng = nt. Since G/H is compact, it has an invariant probability measure. Choosing\nt1 , t2 , * * * independently from this measure and multiplying as above gives remainders\nand a carries process. Just as above, the remainders are independent and uniformly\ndistributed in G/H and the carries process (with values in N ) is a one-dependent,\ntwo-block factor process.\nExample 22. A lovely instance of this set-up explains a classical identity. We begin\nwith the motivation and then translate. Let \u03c3 be a permutation with number of descents\nd(\u03c3). It is known that, for \u03c3 chosen from the uniform distribution on Sn ,\nP (d(\u03c3) = j) = P (j \u2264 U1 + * * * + Un < j + 1) .\n\n(6.1)\n\nOn the right, U1 , U2 , * * * , Un are independent uniforms on [0, 1]. The density and distribution function for U1 +* * *+Un was derived by Laplace; see [30]. Foata [32] proved (6.1)\nby combining Laplace's calculation with an identity of Worpitzky. Richard Stanley [69]\ngives a bijective proof involving an elegant dissection of the n-dimensional hypercube.\nJim Pitman [57] gives the following \"proof from the book\" which is a continuous version\nof our carries argument from Section 1: form two columns\nU1 V1\nU2 V2\n*\n*\n*\n*\nUn Vn\nOn the left are independent uniforms on [0, 1]. On the right are their remainders when\nadded mod 1; so V1 = U1 , V2 = U1 + U2 (mod 1), * * * . The Vi are similarly independent\n23\n\n\funiforms on [0, 1]. Place a dot at position i every time the partial sum U1 + * * * + Ui+1\ncrosses an integer. Call these dots carries. As in the discrete case, there is a dot at\nposition i if and only if there is a descent Vi+1 < Vi . The number of dots is the integer\npart of U1 + * * * + Un and also the number of descents, proving (6.1). Of course, the\ndistribution of the descent process is the same as the carries process.\nIn the language of group theory, let G = R, N = Z, and G/N \u223c\n= S1 , the circle group.\nChoose coset representatives as [0, 1) and factor sets in {0, 1}.\n\n7\n\nProofs and generalizations\n\nThis section proves two of our main results for general one-dependent processes (we do\nnot assume stationarity in this section). In Subsection 7.1, it is shown that all onedependent point processes on Z are determinantal, a result which is new even in the\nstationary case. Subsection 7.2 proves that a point process P on a finite set X , with P\ngiven as a certain-shaped determinant, is one-dependent and determinantal. This covers\nquite a few examples from previous sections and is particularly useful in situations (such\nas Example 12) where the one-dependence is not apriori obvious.\n\n7.1\n\nOne dependent processes are determinantal\n\nFor a random point process on a discrete set X , we define the correlation function \u03c1 by\n\u03c1(A) = P {S : S \u2287 A}.\nThen one dependence on (a segment of) Z is equivalent to the condition that \u03c1(X \u222aY ) =\n\u03c1(X)\u03c1(Y ) whenever dist(X, Y ) \u2265 2.\nTheorem 7.1. Any one-dependent point process on (a segment of Z) is determinantal.\nIts correlation kernel can be written in the form K(x, y) =\n0\n\u22121\nPy\u2212x+1\nr=1\n\nif x \u2212 y \u2265 2\nif x \u2212 y = 1\nP\n(\u22121)r\u22121 x=l0 <l1 <***<lr =y+1 \u03c1 ([l0 , l1 )) \u03c1 ([l1 , l2 )) * * * \u03c1 ([lr\u22121 , lr )) if x \u2264 y\n\nHere the notation [a, b) stands for {a, a + 1, * * * , b \u2212 1}.\n\nFor example, K(x, x) = \u03c1({x}), K(x, x + 1) = \u03c1({x, x + 1}) \u2212 \u03c1({x})\u03c1({x + 1}), etc.\nProof. By one-dependence, it is enough to verify that with K as above,\ndet[K(x + i, x + j)]y\u2212x\ni,j=0 = \u03c1 ([x, y + 1))\nfor any x \u2264 y.\nWe use induction on y \u2212 x. For y = x the statement is trivial. Otherwise, one has\nthat\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\nK(x, x)\nK(x, x + 1)\n. . . K(x, y)\n\uf8ef\n.. \uf8fa\n\uf8ef \u22121\n. \uf8fa\nK(x\n+\n1,\nx\n+\n1)\n.\n.\n.\ny\u2212x\n\uf8fa\ndet[K(x + i, x + j)]0 = det \uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n.. \uf8fa .\n..\n\uf8f0\n.\n\u22121\n. \uf8fb\n\u22121 K(y, y)\n24\n\n\fWhen expanding this determinant, various numbers of \u22121's from the subdiagonal\ncan be used. Observe that if we do not use the \u22121 in position (i, i \u2212 1), then we\ncan compute the corresponding contribution, because if we replace that \u22121 by 0, the\ndeterminant splits into the product of two each of which is computable by the induction\nhypothesis.\nSimilarly, if we insist on not using several \u22121's, then the contribution is the product\nof several determinants. Thus we obtain by inclusion-exclusion that\nX\ndet[K(x + i, x + j)]y\u2212x\n=\nK(x,\ny)\n+\n\u03c1 ([x, l)) \u03c1 ([l, y + 1))\n0\nx<l<y+1\n\n\u2212\n\nX\n\nx<l1 <l2 <y+1\n\n\u03c1 ([x, l1 )) \u03c1 ([l1 , l2 )) \u03c1 ([l2 , y + 1)) + * * * .\n\n(7.1)\n\nThe K(x, y) term corresponds to using all \u22121's, the sum over l corresponds to not using\na \u22121 at least at location (l, l \u2212 1), the sum over l1 , l2 corresponds to not using a \u22121\nat least at locations (lj , lj \u2212 1), j = 1, 2, etc. Our definition of K(x, y) is such that the\nright hand side of (7.1) is equal to \u03c1 ([x, y + 1)), as desired.\nTo state some corollaries of Theorem 7.1, we use the concept of particle-hole involution. Essentially, given a subset N of X , the involution maps a point configuration\nS \u2282 X to S \u25b3 N (here \u25b3 is the symbol for symmetric difference). This map leaves\nintact the particles of S outside of N , and inside N it loses the particles and picks up\nthe \"holes\" (points of N free of particles).\nCorollary 7.2. The class of one-dependent processes is closed under the operations of\nparticle-hole involution on any fixed subset, intersections of independent processes, and\nunions of independent processes.\nProof. For intersections, the claim follows from the definitions.\nFor particle-hole involutions, note that the property of being one-dependent follows\nfrom the kernel begin 0 on the second subdiagonal and below. On the other hand, for\ndeterminantal point processes the \"complementation principle\" [5, Sec. A.3] says that\nthe particle-hole involution can be implemented by the following change in the kernel:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\nA B\nA\nB\n\u2192\n,\nC D\n\u2212C I \u2212 D\nwhere the block structure corresponds to the splitting into the noninverted and inverted\nparts. Clearly, this keeps the property of having 0's on the second subdiagonal and below\nintact.\nFinally, unions can be reduced to intersections by the particle-hole involution.\nRemark. The class of determinantal point processes is not closed under intesections/unions.\nLet us now look at the translation invariant case. Then \u03c1 ([x, y)) = \u03c1y\u2212x is a function\nof y \u2212 x only, and \u03c1k is the chance of k consecutive ones. Set\nX\nR(z) = 1 + z +\n\u03c1k z k+1 .\nk\u22651\n\n25\n\n\fCorollary 7.3. In the translation invariant case, the kernel K(x, y) = k(y \u2212 x) is also\ntranslation invariant, and\nX\n1\n.\nk(n)z n =\n1 \u2212 R(z)\nn\u2208Z\n\nProof.\n\n1\n1 \u2212 R(z)\n\n1\n1\n= \u2212 *\nz 1 + \u03c11 z + \u03c12 z 2 + * * *\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f62\n\uf8f9\nX\nX\n1\n= \u2212 \uf8f01 \u2212\n\u03c1m zm \uf8f8 \u2212 * * * \uf8fb\n\u03c1m z m + \uf8ed\nz\nm\u22651\nm\u22651\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f62\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\nX\nX\n1 1\n= \u2212 + \uf8f0\n\u03c1m z m \uf8f8 + * * * \uf8fb ,\n\u03c1m z m \u2212 \uf8ed\nz z\nm\u22651\n\nm\u22651\n\nwhich agrees with the formula of Theorem 7.1.\n\nThe generating function R(z) also behaves well with respect to the particle-hole\ninvolution on Z.\nProposition 7.4. The particle-hole involution on Z with N = Z replaces R(z) by\n1/R(\u2212z).\nProof. We have\nR(\u2212z)\n1\n1\n=\n=1\u2212\n.\n1 \u2212 1/R(\u2212z)\nR(\u2212z) \u2212 1\n1 \u2212 R(\u2212z)\nHence by Corollary 7.3, changing R(z) to R\u0303(z) = 1/R(\u2212z) leads to the following change\nin the correlation kernel:\nk\u0303(n) = \u03b40,n \u2212 (\u22121)n k(n).\nx\n\nThis is equivalent to K\u0303(x, y) = \u03b4x,y \u2212 (\u22121)\n(\u22121)y K(x, y). This is the same as K \u2192 I \u2212 K,\nwhich corresponds to the particle-hole involution [5, Sec. A.3].\n\nExample 23. The descent process on Z (Example 11) corresponds to \u03c1m =\n\n1\n(m+1)! ;\n\nthus R(z) = ez . The particle-hole involution is given by R\u0303(z) = 1/e\u2212z = ez , which is\nthe same.\nExample 24. The intersection of r independent descent processes on Z corresponds to\n1\n\u03c1m = (m+1)!\nr , hence\nX zm\n(r)\nR\u2229 (z) =\n.\n(m!)r\nm\u22650\nP\n1\nThe correlation kernel is given by n\u2208Z k(n)z n =\n.\n(r)\n1\u2212R\u2229 (z)\n\nExample 25. The union of r independent descent processes is the particle-hole invo(r)\n(r)\nlution of Example 24. Thus R\u222a (z) = 1/R\u2229 (\u2212z) and\nX\n1\n.\nk(n)z n =\n(r)\n1 \u2212 1/R\u2229 (\u2212z)\nn\u2208Z\nReplacing z by \u2212z doesn't affect correlations, and we recover Example 15.\n26\n\n\f7.2\n\nA class of determinantal processes\n\nFor any n = 2, 3, . . . , consider a probability measure Pn on all subsets S = {s1 < s2 <\n* * * < sk } \u2286 [n \u2212 1] given by\nPn (S) = h(n) det [e(si , sj+1 )]ki,j=0 ,\n\n(7.2)\n\nfor some h : N \u2192 C and e : N \u00d7 N \u2192 C with the notation s0 = 0, sk+1 = n.

Here E is a Toeplitz matrix with symbol (\u00ea(z) \u2212 1)/z. It is triangular, so E \u22121 is a Toeplitz matrix with symbol z/(\u00ea(z) \u2212 1). Thus K is a Toeplitz matrix\n1\n1\nwith symbol k\u0302(z) = 1 + \u00ea(z)\u22121\n= 1\u2212(\u00ea(z))\n\u22121 .\nWe also note that in the translation invariant case, there is an expression for Pn (S)\nin terms of skew Schur functions of ribbon type.\nCorollary 7.7. As in Corollary 7.6, assume further that e(i, j) = e(j \u2212 i). Let \u03bb and\n\u03bc be the partitions defined by\n\u03bbi = n \u2212 si\u22121 \u2212 k + i \u2212 1 , \u03bci = n \u2212 si \u2212 k + i \u2212 1, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k + 1.\nLet \u03bb\u2032 , \u03bc\u2032 denote the transpose partitions of \u03bb and \u03bc and let s\u03bb\u2032 /\u03bc\u2032 denote the corresponding skew-Schur function, obtained by specializing the elementary symmetric functions ei\n1\nto equal e(i). Then Pn (S) = e(1)\nn s\u03bb\u2032 /\u03c4 \u2032 .\nProof. By assumption, formula (7.2) becomes\nPn (S) = h(n) * det esj+1 \u2212si\n\n\u0001k\n\ni,j=0\n\n.\n\nNow use the argument of Theorem 4.2, together with the identification of the normalizing constant h(n) = 1/e(1)n in Theorem 7.5.\nRemarks.\n1. Another approach to Theorem 7.5 is via the theory of conditional L-ensembles in\nBorodin\u2013Rains [6, Prop. 1.2].\n2. In the translation invariant case e(i, j) = e(j \u2212 i), Stanley [67, p. 90, Ex. 14] shows\nthat\nPn ([n \u2212 1]) = chance that all sites are occupied\n\nis the coefficient of z n in the power series h(n)\u00ea(\u2212z)\u22121 . To prove this using\nsymmetric function theory, note from Corollary 7.7 that\nPn ([n \u2212 1]) = h(n) * s(n) .\n\nHere the Schur function s(n) = hn (where hn is the nth complete homogeneous\nsymmetric function and h(n) is the normalizing constant in (7.2)). If E(z) =\nP\n\u221e\nr\nr=0 er zPis the generating function for elementary symmetric functions and\n\u221e\nr\nH(z) =\nr=0 hr z , Macdonald [51, p. 21, (2.6)] shows that H(z)E(\u2212z) = 1.\nThis gives Stanley's formula since in Corollary 7.7, the value of er is e(r).\n29\n\n\fExample 26. (Descents in a random\nsequence) From Fact 5 of Section 2, we are\nj+b\u22121\u0001\nin the Toeplitz case with e(j) = b\u22121 , \u00ea(z) = (1 \u2212 z)\u2212b . Applying Corollary 7.6 yields\nTheorem 3.1.\nExample 27. (Descents in a uniform permutation) From MacMahon's formula\n(5.1), we are again in the Toeplitz case with e(j) = 1/j!, \u00ea(z) = ez . As in Example 3,\none can replace z by \u2212z without changing determinants or the correlations functions.\nThis proves Theorem 5.1.\nExample 28. (Descents in a non-uniform permutation) From Stanley's formula\n(part a of Proposition 5.2), we are again in the Toeplitz case with e(j) = 1/j!q (qfactorial). An identity of Euler allows one to write\n\u00ea(z) =\n\nY\n\nm\u22650\n\n1\n1 \u2212 z(1 \u2212 q)q m\n\nwhen 0 < q < 1, |z| < 1, but the elementary description of the correlation functions\ngiven in Proposition 5.2 seems more useful.\n\nAcknowledgments\nBorodin was partially supported by NSF grant DMS 0707163.
