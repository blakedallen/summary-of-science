The dwarf galaxies of the Local Group can be separated\nin three morphological groups: irregular, elliptical and spheroidal. As\nin the large galaxy clusters, there seems to be a morphology-position\nrelationship: irregular galaxies are preferentially found in the outskirts\n(low density regions) of the Local Group, whereas dwarf ellipticals and\nspheroidals are more frequent in the central, high density regions. To\ncast light on the nature and origin of dwarf galaxies in the Local Group,\nMayer et al.(2001) have suggested that a dwarf irregular galaxy tidally\ninteracting with a galaxy of much larger mass may be re-shaped into a\ndwarf spheroidal or elliptical object. In this paper we check by means\nof N-Body Tree-SPH simulations whether this is possible for a selected\nsample of galaxies of the Local Group. Using the best data available\nin literature to fix the dynamical and kinematical status of a few dwarf\ngalaxies in the Local Group, we follow the evolution of an ideal satellite,\nwhich supposedly started as an irregular object during its orbital motion\naround the Milky Way. We find that the tidal interactions with the\nMilky Way remove a large fraction of the mass of the dwarf irregular and\ngradually reshape it into a spherical object.\n\n1.\n\nInitial conditions\n\nWe set up the initial conditions for the orbital motion of a dG around a galaxy\nof larger mass (the MW in our case). This task is hampered by the very small\nnumber of galaxies for which good determinations of the proper motions from\ndirect observations are currently available (Irwin 1998). The original sample of\nmore than 40 galaxies belonging to the LG drastically reduce to 5, all of them\nsatellites of the MW. The orbital parameters for this small group of objects are\nlisted in Table 1.\nThe dIrr galaxy, whose dynamical structure is tested against the gravitational interaction with a large mass object, is supposed to have been formed in\nthe past and to be made of three components: DM, gas, and stars in suitable\nproportions. The total mass of the galaxy is given by the sum of the three\ncomponents MG = Ms + Mg + MDM with obvious meaning of the symbols.\nThe rotation curves (Hoffman et al. 1996) and cosmological arguments\n(Mateo 1998 and reference therein) have clearly indicated that galaxies (the\ndwarf ones in particular) are DM dominated. Therefore we assume that MDM =\n1\n\n\f2\n\nS. Pasetto, C. Chiosi & G.

Furthermore, dIrrs are known to be gas-rich, with the gaseous content\nalmost paralleling the stellar content. We adopt here Mg = Ms .\nThe time scale required to build up the dIrr galaxy to the stage we are\nconsidering is not relevant here provided it is significantly shorter than the Hubble time. Furthermore, stellar activity is supposed to be still underway so that\nduring the simulation more gas is converted into stars. Finally, let us denote\nwith T0 the age of the dIrr at the start of the dynamical simulation. To set up\nthe starting model we have followed Hernquist (1993), whose models have been\nextensively proved to produce stable configurations for systems with more than\none component for a widely explained descrition on the assumption made see\nPasetto et al. (2003 in press).\n2.\n\nEvolution of a dIrr and Metamorphosis\n\nHaving assigned the initial conditions, the evolution of the dIrr (disk) galaxy in\nisolation has been followed by means of the N-Body Tree-SPH code in the last\nversion described by Lia et al.(2002) The evolution is first followed in isolation\nto check the dwarf galaxy model stability and then in evolution around the\nMW whose presence is simply reduced to a force field generated by a suitable,\nconstant gravitational potential at the coordinate origin and with no rotation. In\nthis study we neglect the dynamical friction as suggested in Colpi & Pallavicini\n(1998) and Colpi (1998) As far as the morphology of the satellite is concerned,\ntwo passages at the peri-center are sufficient to make evident the effect we are\nlooking for. The situation is shown in Fig.1 in which a 3-D large scale view of\nthe satellite orbiting about the MW is given at the age T0 + 4 Gyr, i.e. after\ntwo close passages.\nAfter the evolution we can note that\n(i) A bound blob of gas, stars and DM with total mass of about 1.31\u00d7108 M\u2299\nand almost round shape survives. In order to better understand the morphology\nof the new DSph, in Fig.1 we present 3D projections of iso-number density\nregions in the space of positions limited to the sole stellar component so that\ndirect comparison with isophotal contours is possible. In the projection there is\na distinct central concentration of stars with nearly spherical shape surrounded\n\n\fAPS Conf. Ser.

The upper right panel offers a section plane with the\ncontour of the iso-number density of stars in the space of position. The\nvertical bar displays the color code corresponding to different values\nof the number density of stars. The lower left panel shows the surface\nbrigthness profile of the model galaxy at the age T0 + 4Gyr cofronted\nwith the initial one. The lower right panel shows the Star Formation\nRate of the dG as funciton of time for the dG orbiting around and\ninteracting with the MW. The upper sketch displays the refers to the\ngalaxy evolved in isolation. After the initial activity, a number of small\namplitude bursts of stars formation seem to occur.\n\n3\n\n\f4\n\nS. Pasetto, C. Chiosi & G. Carraro\n\nby regions of much lower number density. The newly born object is indeed a\nspheroidal galaxy.\n(ii) The dSph is still DM dominated but for the very central regions where\nthe baryonic mass prevails; it is almost void of gas (or very little) which has\npartly converted to stars and partly lost in the wind and tails stripped by the\nMW. These properties are typical of dSph and strongly suggest that the kind of\nmetamorphosis indicated by the simulations is at work (see Pasetto et al.).\n(iii) The mayor change occurring in the dSph concerns its kinematics. Compared to the initial ones, all the three are lower by a factor of 3 indicating that\nthe initial circular motions have been turned into motions equally shared along\nthe three directions (see Pasetto et al.).\n(iv) Finally, we look at the stellar surface brightness profile (see Fig 1).\nCompared to the profile of the initial the surface brightness profile of the new\ndSph tends to be steeper toward the center as often observationally indicated\nfor the dGs in the Local Group (Mateo 1998).\n(v) For the case under consideration the time scale was of the order of\ntwo passages past the MW (approximately 4 Gyr or shorter). This secures a\nposteriori that neglecting dynamical friction, and consequent evolution of the\nrelative distance between the satellite and the MW, and finally the deformation\nof the MW and consequent spiraling in of the dG towards this, was not too a\nbad approximation: see Colpi & Pallavicini (1998), and Colpi (1998) for more\ndetails and a comparison with N-body simulations.\n(vi) The resulting dSph seems to be stable. As a matter of fact, it survives\nanother close encounter at least at T0 + 6Gyrs. Actually this helps the dSph to\nget a total mass in closer agreement with the observational estimates for dGs of\nthe LG (Mateo 1998)\n(vii) It seems therefore that the intensity of star formation is somehow\nsensitive to the interaction. However, as far as the correlation (if any) of the\nstar forming bursts with the orbital position of the satellite with respect to the\nMW (cf. Mayer et al. 2001) it seems that the most intense ones are favored\nwhen the satellite galaxy is at the peri-galactic. The preliminary conclusion\nwould be that SF is mainly driven by internal processes (see Fig.1).\nReferences\nColpi, M., Pallavicini, A., 1998, ApJ, 525, 720\nColpi, M., 1998, ApJ, 502, 167\nIrwin, M. 1998, IAUS, 192, 29\nHernquist, L., 1993, ApJ, 404, 717\nHoffman, G., L., Salpeter, E., E., Farhat, B., Roos, T., Williams, H., Helou, G.,\n1996, ApJS, 105, 269\nLia, C., Portinari, L., Carraro, G., 2002, MNRAS, 330, 821\nMateo, M., 1998, ARA&A, 36, 435\nMayer, L., Governato, F., Colpi, M., Moore, B., Quinn, T., Wadsley, J., Stadel,\nJ., Lake, G., ApJ, 559, 754\nPasetto, S., Chiosi, C., Carraro, G., 2003, A&A 403, 931\n\n\f"}
