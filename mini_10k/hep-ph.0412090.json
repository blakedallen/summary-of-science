The combined results from\nsolar, atmospheric and long baseline neutrino experiments are well described by oscillations\nof three active neutrinos \u03bde , \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u03c4 , with mass squared splittings estimated to be\n5.4\u00d710\u22125 < \u2206m2sol < 9.5\u00d710\u22125 eV2 and 1.2\u00d710\u22123 < \u2206m2atm < 4.8\u00d710\u22123 eV2 [3]. However,\nthe Los Alamos Liquid Scintillation Detector (LSND) requires 10 > \u2206m2 > 0.2 eV2 [4], a\nserious disagreement with the other results. The MiniBooNE experiment at Fermilab [5] is\nin the process of checking the validity of the LSND experiment. Taking at face value the\nLSND results, a minimum of four neutrinos seems to be required to explain all available\nneutrino data. LEP-SLC measurements of the Z decay width restrict the number of active\nneutrinos to three; thus one or more of the neutrinos must be \"sterile\" [6]. Such scenarios\nhave been studied extensively [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Mixing of sterile and active\nneutrinos affects directly the present neutrino experiments and limits have been set on such\nmixings. A valid question remains: how natural is it, in a beyond the Standard Model\nscenario, to obtain physically acceptable mixings between sterile and active neutrinos, while\nmaintaining the constraints from weak scale phenomenology.\nSeveral extensions of the Standard Model predict the existence of exotic fermions. Of\nthese, superstring theories represent the most promising scenario for a unified theory of all\nfundamental interactions. One set of superstring theories are anomaly-free ten dimensional\ntheories based on E8 \u00d7 E8 heterotic strings coupled to N=1 gravity [17], with matter belonging to the 27 representation of E6 . Previous interest in the E6 GUTs dates as far as\n1970's [18] when it was noted that E6 was the next anomaly-free choice group after SO(10),\nand that each generation of fermions can be placed in the 27-plet representation.\nThe E6 spectrum contains several neutral exotic fermions, some which could be interpreted as sterile neutrinos. The precise details of mass generation and mixing with the active\nneutrinos would depend on which subgroup of E6 is considered. There are many phenomenologically acceptable low energy models which arise from E6 . In this work we concentrate on\nrank-5 subgroups, which can always break to SU(3)C \u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y \u00d7 U(1)\u03b7 [19, 20].\nWe analyze neutrino masses and mixings, as well as active-sterile neutrino assignments\nand mixing in group decompositions of E6 under the maximal subgroup SU(3)C \u00d7 SU(3)L \u00d7\n2\n\n\fSU(3)H to the Standard Model. These intermediate subgroups can include extra SU(2)\ngroups, which give rise to the usual Left-Right symmetric model (LR) [21], the Alternative\nLeft-Right symmetric model (ALR) [22] and the Inert model [19, 23]. Though there are\nsmall differences among these groups with regards to neutrino masses and mixing, we shall\nbe able to present a study applicable to all. We keep this discussion valid for the nonsupersymmetric case, leaving the details for the supersymmetric scenario to another work\n[24].\nOur paper is organized as follows. We discuss these models in Section 2. In sections\n3 and 4 we analyze neutrino masses and mixings in the Alternative Left-Right and Inert\nmodels, respectively. Both of these models suffer from predicting too large a Dirac mass\nfor the active neutrinos. We suggests mechanisms to rectify this problem in Section 5. We\ndiscuss the implications of our results and conclude in Section 6.\n\nII.\n\nTHE MODELS\n\nThe fundamental representation of E6 , the 27-plet, branches into\n27 = (3c , 3, 1) + (3\u0304c , 1, 3\u0304) + (1c , 3\u0304, 3)\n=\n\nq\n\n+\n\nq\u0304\n\n+\n\nl\n\n(2.1)\n\nunder the maximal subgroup, SU(3)C \u2297 SU(3)L \u2297 SU(3)H . The particle content of the\n27-plet for one family under this decomposition can be written as\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\nc\nE N \u03bd\nu\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec c\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\nc c c\nq = \uf8ec d \uf8f7 , q\u0304 = (u d h )L , l = \uf8ec N E e \uf8f7 .\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ed \uf8f8\nec \u03bd c S c\nh\n\n(2.2)\n\nL\n\nL\n\nHere we have used the notation that SU(3)L (SU(3)H ) operates vertically (horizontally)\nand the minus signs in front of the fields are suppressed.1\n1\n\nThere are three ways to\n\nWe write fields as left-chiral Dirac spinors and throughout the rest of the paper we use fLc for a fermion\nfield f as a shorthand notation for (f c )L , as we know that the\n! chiral projection and conjugation do not\n\u2212\u01eb\n0\ncommute. Thus, fLc \u2261 (fR )c = C\u03b3 0 fR\u2217 where C =\n. Here we adopt the chiral representation\n0 \u01eb\nand \u01eb \u2261 i\u03c32 .\n\n3\n\n\fembed an SU(2)H into the SU(3)H , just as I-spin, U-spin and V -spin can be embedded in the SU(3) flavor group.\n\nThe best-known breaking is when the first and the\n\nsecond columns form a SU(2)H doublet; this corresponds to the LR symmetric model\n(H = R).\n\nAn alternative version is when the first and the third columns form an\n\nSU(2)H doublet; this corresponds to the ALR symmetric model (H = R\u2032 ).\n\nFinally,\n\nthe second and the third columns can form an SU(2)\n\uf8eb H doublet;\n\uf8f6 this corresponds to the\nEc N\n\uf8f8 , and hcL (and the third\nInert model (H = I). In LR, (uc dc )L ((ec \u03bd c )L ), \uf8ed\nc\nN E\nL\ncolumn of l) become SU(2)R doublets,\na\nbi-doublet,\nand\nsinglets,\nrespectively. For\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nc\n\nc\n\nc\n\nc\n\nthe ALR case, (h u )L ((e S )L ), \uf8ed\n\nEc \u03bd\nc\n\n\uf8f8 , and dcL (and the particles in the second\n\nN e\nL\ncolumn of l) are the\ncorresponding\nones\nunder\nSU(2)R\u2032 . Finally in the Inert model,\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nN \u03bd\n\uf8f8 , and ucL (and the particles in the first column of l) are the\n(hc dc )L ((\u03bd c S c )L ), \uf8ed\nE e\nL\ncorresponding multiplets under SU(2)I .\nTo determine the U(1) quantum numbers, we need to look at the electromagnetic charge\n\noperator. If we consider the case where only SU(3)L is broken down to SU(2)L \u2297 U(1)YL ,\nthe electromagnetic charge Qem = I3L + Y /2 for all q\u0304 becomes zero. Therefore, SU(3)H \u2192\nSU(2)H \u2297 U(1)YH is needed such that SU(2)H and/or U(1)YH can contribute to Qem . When\nboth SU(2)H and U(1)YH contribute to Qem , we end up with the LR\n\n2\n\nand ALR symmetric\n\nmodels. The \"Inert\" model, is obtained when the SU(2)H does not contribute to Qem .\nWe will use the notation H = R, R\u2032 , I; YH = YR,R\u2032 ,I for the LR, ALR and Inert groups,\nrespectively. The gauge groups are at this level SU(3)C \u2297 SU(2)L \u2297 SU(2)R \u2297 U(1)L \u2297\nU(1)R , SU(3)C \u2297 SU(2)L \u2297 SU(2)R\u2032 \u2297 U(1)L \u2297 U(1)R\u2032 , and SU(3)C \u2297 SU(2)L \u2297 SU(2)I \u2297\n\nU(1)Y \u2297 U(1)\u2032 for LR, ALR and Inert cases, respectively [19, 25].

The\nneutral components of HS , H1 , H2, and H3 are scalars with the same quantum numbers\nas \u03bdLc , SLc , NL , and (NLc , \u03bdL ) and they are from (16, 1), (1, 1), (10, 5), and ((10, 5), (16, 5))\nrepresentations under (SU(10), SU(5)), respectively. In the case of the Inert model, however,\nthe representations are slightly different [23]. There is no singlet scalar field (HS ) under\nSU(2)I but an additional neutral SU(2)I doublet HD is needed. This doublet corresponds\nto the components \u03bdLc and SLc of the fermion doublet.

This hierarchy is needed from the fact that no experimental signal for the\nexotic quarks and leptons has been observed. The mass terms for the fermions can be\nobtained from the dimension-4 Yukawa interactions of the form LY = \u03bb\u03c8(27)\u03c8(27)H(27).\nHere \u03c8(27) is the 27-plet of E6 involving leptons and quarks, and H(27) is the one involving\nHiggs scalars. The coefficient \u03bb represents the corresponding generation dependent Yukawa\ncoupling, where generation indices are suppressed. The explicit mass terms in the above\nLagrangian LY can be written using the fact that each term has total hypercharge Y zero\nand is invariant under the gauge group of the model under consideration (that is, terms\ninvariant under the SU(3)C \u2297 SU(2)L \u2297 SU(2)R\u2032 \u2297 U(1)V gauge group for the ALR model\nand under the SU(3)C \u2297 SU(2)L \u2297 SU(2)I \u2297 U(1)Y gauge group for the Inert model).\n6\n\n\fTherefore, all the allowed Yukawa terms can be written with the use of the Tables I and II.\nWe consider the neutral sector of the 27-plet of E6 in the rest of the paper for the ALR and\nInert models. Similar results can be obtained for LR models.\n\nIII.\n\nNEUTRINOS IN THE ALR SYMMETRIC MODEL\n\nWe now look at the allowed Yukawa couplings in the ALR model. For convenience, we\nuse the following notation:\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\nu\nN\nQ = \uf8ed \uf8f8 (3, 2, 1, 1/6) , X c = (hc uc )L (3, 1, 2, \u22121/6) , L\u2032 = \uf8ed \uf8f8 (1, 2, 1, 0) ,\nd\nE\nL\nL\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nEc \u03bd\n\uf8f8 (1, 2, 2, 0) , Lc = (ec S c ) (1, 1, 2, 1/2) .\n(3.1)\nF = \uf8ed\nL\nc\nN e\nL\n\nThen, all possible Yukawa terms which are SU(3)C \u2297 SU(2)L \u2297 SU(2)R\u2032 \u2297 U(1) invariant\n\ncan be written using of the Higgs fields in Eq. (2.3). The Yukawa Lagrangian is\n\u03bb2\n[F F HS + F H3 \u03bdLc ] + \u03bb3 QH3 X c\n2\n+\u03bb4 dcL QH2 + \u03bb5 hL X c H1 + \u03bb6 hL dcL HS ,\n\nLY = \u2212\u03bb1 [Lc F H2 + Lc H3 L\u2032 + H1 F L\u2032 ] +\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere we suppress all generation indices and use a shorthand notation for each term. So, for\nexample, Lc F H2 should be read as (Lc )T \u01eb F \u01eb H2 with \u01eb = i\u03c32 . The part of the Lagrangian\nrelevant to our discussion here is (when the Higgs fields get vev's)\nL0Y = \u03bb1 [v1 (eL ecL \u2212 NLc SLc ) \u2212 v2 ecL EL \u2212 v3 NL SLc + N1 (EL ELc \u2212 NL NLc )]\n+\u03bb2 [v2 \u03bdLc NLc + v3 \u03bdL \u03bdLc + N2 (\u2212eL ELc + \u03bdL NLc )] + \u03bb3 v3 uL ucL ,\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere we have suppressed family indices and include charged lepton terms and part of the \u03bb3\nterm for later convenience.3 Here it should be understood that the eL ecL term, for example,\nstands for (ec )TL C eL \u2261 eR eL .\n3\n\nSince this paper is concentrating on neutrinos, we will not discuss mixing between light and heavy fields in\nthe charged lepton or quark sectors. Such mixing can have a wide range of interesting phenomenological\neffects, see Ref. [26] for a detailed discussion and a list of references.\n\n7\n\n\fFrom the above Yukawa interactions, the Majorana mass matrix for the neutral fields in\nthe (\u03bdL , NL , NLc , \u03bdLc , SLc ) basis becomes (for one generation)\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0\n0\n\u03bb2 N2 \u03bb2 v3\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0\n\uf8f7\n0\n\u2212\u03bb\nN\n0\n\u2212\u03bb\nv\n1\n1\n1\n3\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n\u03bb\nN\n\u2212\u03bb\nN\n0\n\u03bb\nv\n\u2212\u03bb\nv\nMneutral = \uf8ec\n2\n2\n1\n1\n2\n2\n1\n1\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n0\n\u03bb2 v2\n0\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \u03bb2 v3\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n0 \u2212\u03bb1 v3 \u2212\u03bb1 v1 0\n0\n\n(3.4)\n\nFurther we define \u03bb1 v1 \u2261 meec , \u03bb1 N1 \u2261 mEE c , and \u03bb2 v3 \u2261 m\u03bd\u03bd c since it is clear from Eq. (3.3)\nthat meec , mEE c , and m\u03bd\u03bd c are the Dirac mass terms for the electron eL , the exotic charged\nlepton EL , and the ordinary (active) neutrino \u03bdL . Note that the SM (active) neutrino gets\nDirac mass from the same source as the up quark. Thus, at the first stage, there appears\nto be a large Dirac mass problem for the neutrinos unless there is an (unnatural) hierarchy\n\u03bb2 \u226a \u03bb3 . Unlike the \"conventional\" see-saw model, we do not have a large Majorana mass\nterm for the right-handed neutrino, so other techniques must be used to deal with this large\nmass. This problem is also severe in both the Inert and the ordinary LR symmetric models\nwhere the active neutrinos and up quark (the electron for LR case) get their Dirac masses\nfrom the same source. We will discuss the Inert model case in the next section. For the\nordinary LR symmetric model, see [27, 28] for further details.\nThe secular equation for the eigenvalues cannot be solved exactly, and so we expand in\npowers of vi /Ni . In this approximation (neglecting O(vi /Ni ) terms), there are two roots of\nthe secular equation which correspond to states with mass eigenvalue \u00b1m\u03bd\u03bd c . The other\nthree mass eigenvalues can also be determined, again under the assumption that \u03bb2 v2 \u223c\nm\u03bd\u03bd c \u223c meec \u226a \u03bb2 N2 \u223c mEE c\n2m\u03bd\u03bd c (meec mEE c + \u03bb22 v2 N2 )\n,\nR1 \u2243 \u2212\nm2EE c + \u03bb22 N22\nq\nR2,3 \u2243 \u00b1 m2EE c + \u03bb22 N22 ,\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhere we neglect the terms of the order vi /Ni . The associated eigenvectors with R2 and\np\nR3 form a Dirac spinor with mass m2EE c + \u03bb22 N22 . R1 is the lightest mass eigenvalue\n(\u226a m\u03bd\u03bd c ) which represents the lightest mass eigenstate. The corresponding eigenvectors\n\ncan be found in a straightforward manner under the same assumption that we have used to\n8\n\n\fget the eigenvalues and the transformation from the mass eigenstates to the flavor eigenstates\nbecomes\n\uf8eb\n\n|\u03bdL i\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n0\n\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec |N i \uf8f7 \uf8ec 0\n\uf8ec L \uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec c \uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec |NL i \uf8f7 = \uf8ec 0\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec c \uf8f7 \uf8ec \u03bb2 N2\n\uf8ec |\u03bdL i \uf8f7 \uf8ec R\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed c \uf8f8 \uf8ed m c\n|SL i\n\u2212 EE\nR\n\nwhere R \u2261\n\n\u03bb2 N2\nR\n\nc\nc\n\u2212 \u03bb2RN2 \u2212 mEE\n\u2212 mEE\nR\nR\n\nmEE c\nR\n\nc\n\u2212 mEE\nR\n\n\u03bb2 N2\nR\n\n\u03bb2 N2\nR\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nmEE c\nR\n\nc\n\u2212 mEE\nR\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u03bb2 N2\nR\n\n\u2212 \u03bb2RN2\n\np\n2(m2EE c + \u03bb22 N22 ).\n\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n\n|\u03bd1 i\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8ec\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec |\u03bd i \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8ec 2 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8ec\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec |\u03bd3 i \uf8f7 ,\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8ec\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec |\u03bd4 i \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8ec\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f8\uf8ed\n|\u03bd5 i\n\n(3.6)\n\nAt this stage there appears another potential problem in that the lightest mass eigenstate\nis |\u03bd1 i = \u221a\n\n1\nm2EE c +\u03bb22 N22\n\n[\u03bb2 N2 |\u03bdLc i \u2212 mEE c |SLc i]. Both \u03bdLc and SLc transform as singlets under\n\nthe weak interaction gauge group SU(2)L . This presumed physical neutrino state does not\ncouple with the left handed SM particles at the low energy scale where the neutrinos are\nrelevant.4 The mass is of the order of magnitude of m2\u03bd\u03bd c /mEE c , which is the expected order\nof magnitude for neutrinos. We thus have two problems: the active neutrinos have a mass of\nthe same order of magnitude as the up quark mass, and the lightest neutrino is composed of\nSU(2)L singlets. After considering neutrinos in the Inert model, we will address the above\nissues and discuss the possible solutions.\n\nIV.\n\nNEUTRINOS IN THE INERT MODEL\n\nThe neutral fermion mass matrix has similarities with that of the ALR model. The\nYukawa interactions are invariant under the SU(2)I group which transforms (NL EL ) \u21d4\n\n(\u03bdL eL ) , dcL \u21d4 hcL , and \u03bdLc \u21d4 SLc . By following the same procedure as for the ALR symmetric\n\nmodel, one can obtain the Yukawa Lagrangian for the Inert group and the relevant part of\nit reads\nL\u2032Y0 = \u03bb\u20321 [v1 NLc SLc + v2 \u03bdLc NLc + v3 (\u03bdL \u03bdLc + NL SLc ) + N1 (NL NLc + EL ELc )\n+N2 (\u03bdL NLc + eL ELc )] + \u03bb\u20322 [v1 eL ecL + v2 ecL EL ] + \u03bb\u20323 v3 uL ucL ,\n4\n\n(4.1)\n\nEven though SLc is a part of SU (2)R\u2032 doublet and it is possible to consider its interaction with left handed\nSM leptons through Higgs bi-doublet at the scales where ALR gauge group is not broken.\n\n9\n\n\fwhere the \u03bb\u20323 -term is especially included to show that, as in the ALR case, the \u03bdL neutrinos\nget Dirac masses from the same Higgs scalar as the up quark. Without fine tuning between\n\u03bb\u20321 and \u03bb\u20323 , the Inert model has the same Dirac mass problem for active neutrinos as ALR.\nThe mass matrix for one generation in the basis (\u03bdL , NL , NLc , \u03bdLc , SLc )\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u2032\n\u2032\n0\n0 \u03bb1 N2 \u03bb1 v3 0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\uf8ec 0\n0\n\u03bb\nN\n0\n\u03bb\nv\n1 1\n1 3 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec \u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\uf8ec\nMneutral = \uf8ec \u03bb1 N2 \u03bb1 N1 0 \u03bb1 v2 \u03bb1 v1 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec \u2032\n\u2032\n\u03bb\nv\n0\n\u03bb\nv\n0\n0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec 1 3\n1 2\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n0 \u03bb\u20321 v3 \u03bb\u20321 v1 0\n0\n\n(4.2)\n\nHere we recall \u03bb\u20321 v1 \u2261 m\u2032eec , \u03bb\u20321 N1 \u2261 m\u2032EE c , and \u03bb\u20321 v3 \u2261 m\u2032\u03bd\u03bd c .

We will discuss possible remedies\nthese problems for both models in the next section.\n\nV.\n\nSOLUTIONS TO THE NEUTRINO MASS PROBLEM\n\nAs shown in the last two sections, both ALR and Inert models (as well as the conventional LR symmetric model) have a Dirac neutrino mass problem at the first stage. This\nseems to be a general feature of string-inspired low-energy E6 models. Both models under\n10\n\n\fconsideration predict that the lightest neutrino state, while having a reasonable mass, is\ncomposed of SU(2)L singlets. Furthermore, in their neutral fermion spectrum, there are\nneutrino eigenstates having masses of the order of the up quark mass (or the electron mass\nfor the conventional LR model). There are three methods discussed in the literature to\nrectify this latter neutrino mass problem. The smallness of the neutrino masses can be\nachieved by introducing a discrete symmetry (the DS method) [29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34], or\nby including a non-renormalizable higher-order dimensional operators (the HDO method)\n[28, 35, 36, 37], or using light E6 singlet fields ( the additional neutral fermion (ANF)\nmethod ) [38, 39, 40]. We discuss the features of the models under consideration for each\nof these three methods. As we will see, the predictions are quite different. The DS method\nis the most attractive method among them as it doesn't require any further particles or the\nexistence of some intermediate scale. However, it does not help in non-SUSY framework\n(at least for the simplest discrete symmetry) without introducing many additional particles. The HDO method will offer a partial solution but does not predict any light sterile\nneutrino(s) and requires new Higgs fields from 27 representation of E6 , and the existence\nof some intermediate scale, which further breaks the gauge groups of the model. The ANF\nmethod works well for predicting the lightest state with sterile neutrino(s) mixing and can\nexplain the LSND result. However, the method requires a discrete symmetry as well as new\nneutral E6 fermion fields, and a pair of 27 + 27 split Higgs multiplets whose vev's do not\nrequire hierarchical separation.\n\nA.\n\nThe Discrete Symmetry Method\n\nFollowing the above discussion, the Discrete Symmetry (DS) method is the most economical. The symmetry transformation which is introduced should restrict the existence\nof the Dirac mass term v3 \u03bdL \u03bdLc at tree level in the Lagrangian (Eqs. (3.3) and (4.1)) while\nallowing couplings so that one-loop radiative corrections can be used to generate naturally\nsmall Dirac masses for neutrinos (although it may be necessary to put some upper limits for\nproducts of some Yukawa couplings). The symmetry should also avoid rapid proton decay.\nIn the supersymmetric versions of both the ALR symmetric and the Inert model, there\nexist leptoquark couplings mediated by hL and hcL particles and these couplings are needed\nto induce nonzero one-loop neutrino mass. Since we do not consider the existence of the\n11\n\n\fHiggs fields carrying SU(3) color, there is no direct analogy in non-SUSY scenarios coming\nfrom the supersymmetrized versions of the models. It should be noted that the rapid proton\ndecay is not an issue.\nAn example of such a symmetry, which was considered within the SUSY framework of\nthe general E6 model [29, 30] is Z2 \u2297 Z3 . The Z2 in that case was related to SUSY, and\nin this non-SUSY framework a simple Z3 will suffice. It is not difficult to see that such\nsymmetries must be able to differentiate between generations as long as a non-zero one-loop\nDirac neutrino mass is generated while at the same time eliminating the tree level mass term\n(see [33, 34] for details).\nIn both models considered here, tree level masses of both the neutrinos and the up quark\nare obtained from the Higgs field with vev v3 . As we shall show shortly, eliminating the v3 term will cause difficulty. Let us consider the ALR model. The Inert model has very similar\nfeatures. For a one-loop Dirac neutrino mass, as depicted in Fig. 1 for a specific choice, the\nH10 SU(2)L Higgs singlet, H2 and H3 SU(2)L Higgs doublets must all participate.

Here H3,1 represents the first column of the\nH3 bi-doublet. Then the relevant terms in the Yukawa Lagrangian Eq.

If the SM\ncharged leptons and H2\u2212 and H3\u2212 fields are circulating in the loop, the H3+ \u03bdLc eL interaction is\nalso proportional to \u03bb2 , thus this diagram vanishes. For the case when EL , ELc are circulating\nin the loop instead of the SM charged leptons, it is still necessary to have a nonzero \u03bb2 (clear\nfrom Eq. (5.2)) to get a one loop Dirac mass for \u03bdL . Therefore, eliminating H30 \u03bdL \u03bdLc by the\nZ3 symmetry also prevents one-loop mass generation. This fact remains true for higher order\nloops. The same conclusion applies for the Inert model as well.\nOne could consider the possibility that v3 could be zero. Then \u03bb2 doesn't need to be zero\nand one-loop Dirac neutrino mass generation is possible. In that case, however, all the up\nquarks (u, c, t) become massless at tree level and generating the top quark mass from a loop\ndiagram is very unlikely, within the context of perturbation theory.\nIt still is possible to generate a one-loop Dirac neutrino mass if many additional fields\nare introduced. For example, if one allows for \"generations\" of Higgs fields, then the \u03bb\nparameters above are all third rank tensors. In such a case, one can arrange the potential\nso that some of the H3 vev's vanish. Then the discrete symmetry can couple \u03bdL \u03bdLc to fields\nthat do not get vev's, thus allowing a one-loop Dirac mass to be generated. To do that, let's\nassign the following charges for the matter fields under Z3\nZ3 :\n\n[Q, dcL , hL , hcL , L, \u03bdLc ](i) \u2192 \u03b7 [Q, dcL , hL , hcL , L, \u03bdLc ](i) ,\n(1)\n\nF1\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n\u2192 \u03b7 \u22121 F1 , F1\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n\u2192 F1 , F1\n\n(3)\n\n\u2192 \u03b7F1 ,\n\nH (1) \u2192 \u03b7 \u22121 H (1) , H (2) \u2192 \u03b7H (2) , H (3) \u2192 H (3) ,\n13\n\n\fc(1)\n\nSL\n\nc(1)\n\nc(2)\n\n\u2192 \u03b7 \u22121 SL\n\n, SL\n\nc(2)\n\nc(3)\n\n\u2192 \u03b7SL , SL\n\nc(3)\n\n\u2192 SL ,\n\n(5.4)\n\nwhere F1 is the first column of the bidoublet F , and similarly the Higgs fields as\nZ3 :\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(3)\n\nH3,1 \u2192 \u03b7 \u22121 H3,1 , H3,1 \u2192 H3,1 , H3,1 \u2192 \u03b7H3,1 ,\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(3)\n\nH2 \u2192 \u03b7 \u22121 H2 , H2 \u2192 \u03b7H2 , H2 \u2192 H2 ,\n0(1)\n\nH1\n\n0(1)\n\n\u2192 \u03b7 \u22121 H1\n\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\n0(2)\n\n, H1\n\n0(2)\n\n\u2192 \u03b7H1\n\n(i)\n\n0(3)\n\n, H1\n\n0(3)\n\n\u2192 H1\n\n,\n\n(i)\n\nH3,2 \u2192 \u03b7H3,2 , HS \u2192 \u03b7HS ,\n\n(5.5)\n\nwhere the rest of the fields are assumed to be invariant under Z3 and \u03b7 3 = 1. In this\n(3)\n\nparticular choice we take the vev of H3,1 , v3 , as zero. Then, the Lagrangian for the ALR\nsymmetric model, given in Eq. (3.2) reduces to\nLY =\n\nh\n(1)\nc(\u03b2)\n(\u03b1) c(\u03b2)\n+(\u03b2)\n(1) (\u03b1) c(\u03b2)\nH2 L(\u03b1) eL + H (1) H3,2 eL + H (1) L(\u03b1) H1\n+ H2 F1 SL\nh\ni\n(3)\nc(j)\n(3) (i) c(j)\n(\u03b1) c(\u03b2)\n(\u03b1) 0(\u03b2)\nH3,1 L(i) \u03bdL + F1 H3,2 \u03bdL\n+ \u03bb3ij\n+H (1) H3,1 SL + H (1) F1 H1\n2\nh\ni\ni\n(3) (i) (j)\n(1) c(i) (j)\n(1) c(i) (j)\n(2) (i) c(j)\n1ij\n+F1 L HS + \u03bb3 H3,1 uL Q + H3,2 hL Q\n+ \u03bb2ij\n4 H2 Q d L\n\n\u2212\u03bb1\u03b1\u03b2\n1\n\n(2) (i) c(j)\n\n(i) c(j)\n\n(k)\n\nijk\n+\u03bb2ij\n5 H1 hL hL + \u03bb6 hL dL HS ,\n\n(5.6)\n\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 run only over the second and third generations. Now, the only tree level Dirac\n(3)\n\nc(j)\n\n(i)\nmass term for \u03bdL , \u03bb3ij\n2 H3,1 L \u03bdL , vanishes if all the particles are neutral due to zero vev\n(3)\n\nv3 . Note that writing the Lagrangian for the Inert model can be done easily by applying\nthe following substitutions to Eq. (5.6); F1 \u21d4 L\u2032 , ucL \u21d4 dcL , ec \u21d4 \u03bd c , H3,1 \u21d4 H2 , H1 \u2192\nHD , HS \u2192 0. The grouping of the terms in Inert case will be slightly different. We will\nstick the ALR case in the rest of the subsection.\nDue to the radiative corrections based on the remaining interactions given in Eq. (5.6),\n(i) c(j)\n\n\u03bdL \u03bdL\n\nDirac masses are induced through one-loop diagram shown in Fig. 1. If we assume\n\nthat the product \u03bbH N1 is of the same order as the charged Higgs masses, which are further\nassumed degenerate and much heavier than any fermion in the loop, the magnitudes of the\nDirac masses are roughly estimated as\n\u03b1j\nM\u03bd\u03bd\nc =\n\nm\u03c4 \u03c4 c 1\u03b13 33j\n\u03bb \u03bb .\n16\u03c0 2 1 2\n\n(5.7)\n\nIn order for such radiative masses to be of the order of 10\u22121 eV, the product of the relevant\n33j\nYukawa couplings \u03bb1\u03b13\nshould be less than O(10\u22128). It is further possible to generate\n1 \u03bb2\n\n14\n\n\fvery light Majorana masses for both SLc and \u03bdLc through one-loop.5 Majorana masses for SLc\nare obtained by replacing the tau lepton in Fig. 1 with the E lepton, but are very supressed\n(\u223c \u03bb21 m2H \u2212 /mEE c ) and similarly for \u03bdLc . If we include these Majorana masses, this opens\nup the possibility of having so-called pseudo-Dirac neutrinos when MS c S c , M\u03bd c \u03bd c \u226a M\u03bd\u03bd c is\nsatisfied [41].\nSuch models have far too many parameters to be predictive and are very contrived. We\nthus turn to the HDO and ANF schemes, which are much more predictive.\n\nB.\n\nThe HDO Method in the ALR and the Inert Models\n\nThis method has been discussed in the framework of rank-6 version of the LR symmetric\nmodel [28] where it has been shown that the higher dimensional operators (HDO), specifically\ndimension-5 operators, give sizable contributions to the neutral sector of the fermion mass\nmatrix. The method requires the existence of an intermediate scale at which the group is\nbroken to the SM gauge group. Two of the Higgs fields (for our discussion, H1 and HS in\nthe ALR case, and HD in the Inert case) will acquire vev's of the order of the intermediate\nscale (\u223c 1011 GeV).\nThe leading HDO Yukawa interactions are the dimension-5 operators. If we neglect the\ncontributions coming from operators with dim > 5,6 the non-renormalizable dimension-5\noperator is\n(5)\n\nLY =\n\nf T\n\u03c8 (27) \u01eb H(27) C H T (27) \u01eb \u03c8(27) ,\nMc\n\n(5.8)\n\nwhere the Higgs fields H are from the 27 representation of E6 and their quantum numbers\nare taken as the opposite of the ones listed in Table II. Here, Mc is the compactification\nscale, or 1018 GeV. The inclusion of the above dimension-5 interactions will modify all entries\nin the fermion sector (both the charged and the neutral fields). However, from Table I, it\nis possible to show that except the \u03bdLc \u2212 SLc submatrix in the neutral sector all entries get\n\ncontributions which are negligible compared to with their dimension-4 entries.7\n5\n6\n\n7\n\nNeither NL nor NLc can get such one-loop Majorana masses in this framework.\nIt is safe to neglect them since they are suppressed by some quadratic, cubic or higher powers of the\ncompactification scale, Mc (\u223c 1018 GeV).\nfv N\nfN N\nfv v\nNegligible contributions are either 0, or Mi c j , or Mi c j form to the appropriate entries, but not Mic j .\n\n15\n\n\fThe \u03bdLc \u2212 SLc submatrix, a null 2 \u00d7 2 matrix at the dimension-4 level, becomes, in the\nALR model\n\uf8eb\n\nM\u03bd c \u2212S c = \uf8ed\n\nK1 K12\nK12 K2\n\nN2\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8,\n\n(5.9)\n\n1 N2\nwhere K12 \u2261 2f NM\nand Ki \u2261 f Mic . Obviously, Ki \u223c K12 \u2243 104 GeV for an intermediate\nc\n\nscale 1011 GeV and the coupling constant f is of order of unity. The nonzero 2 \u00d72 submatrix\n\nwith large entries gives a new \"see-saw-like\" structure to the 5 \u00d7 5 matrix. The submatrix\n\nin the (\u03bdLc , SLc ) basis will induce small but non-zero entries in the upper-left 2 \u00d7 2 submatrix\nspanned by (\u03bdL , NL ). The mass eigenvalues for the matrix in Eq.

Now, the\nspectrum consists of one light state, \u03bd1 , and four heavy states, \u03bd2,3,4,5 . Moreover, the light\nstate is formed by the flavor states \u03bdL and NL of the form\n1\n[mEE c |\u03bdL i \u2212 \u03bb2 N2 |NL i] ,\n\u03bd1 \u2243 p 2\nmEE c + \u03bb22 N22\n16\n\n(5.12)\n\n\fwhich is an acceptable physical state as both \u03bdL and NL are members of two different\nSU(2)L doublets. Therefore our physical neutrino state can now couple with the electron\nand the other SM particles in a desired way. The mass of the state is still as light as\nm2\u03bd\u03bd c /K1,2,12 (or (\u03bb1 v3 )2 /K1,2,12 ) \u223c 0.02 eV when we take the m\u03bd\u03bd c around the mass of the\nup quark.\nOne can repeat the same calculation for the Inert model. The features are very similar.\nExcept the \u03bdLc \u2212 SLc submatrix, all other entries get negligible contributions from Eq. (5.8)\nand in the submatrix, the corresponding SU(2)I Higgs doublet HD from the 27-plet of E6\nis involved and the submatrix will be the same as the one in Eq. (5.9). The eigenvalues are\nslightly different from the ones given in Eq.

Then the transformation matrix can be\nformed by finding the corresponding mass eigenstates and it has the same form as the one\nin the ALR model given in Eq. (5.11). Note that the results differ from each other when we,\nfor example, keep terms in the O(vi /Ni , vi /K1,2,12 ) order. The lightest state \u03bd1\u2032 is composed\nof \u03bdL and NL of the form\n\u03bd1\u2032 \u2243 p\n\n1\nm\u20322\nEE c\n\n+\n\n2\n\u03bb\u20322\n1 N2\n\n[m\u2032EE c |\u03bdL i \u2212 \u03bb\u20321 N2 |NL i] ,\n\n(5.14)\n\nwhere the flavor states \u03bdL and NL mix, like in the ALR model. From these results we see\nthat the HDO method solves the problems in both models, under the assumption that there\nexists an intermediate scale at the order of 1011 GeV and both N1 and N2 get vev's at that\nscale.\nSince there is only one light state (per generation, of course), there is no sterile neutrino\nin the model. The NL only couples to the E, and which is very heavy, the net effect of\nthe mixing (in either the ALR or Inert model) will be to lower the coupling of the electron\nneutrino to the electron and WL -boson. For the ALR case (the Inert case is basically the\n\u03bb1 N1\n.\n\u03bb21 N12 +\u03bb22 N22\n2\n2\n\u03bb N\n\u2212 2\u03bb22 N22 .\n1 1\n\nsame), the coupling is reduced by a factor of \u221a\n\u03bb2 N2 \u226a \u03bb1 N1 , and this factor then becomes 1\n17\n\nSince the mixing must be small,\n\n\fThis reduction would give a very clear signature for the model. The electron neutrino\nwould not oscillate into a sterile neutrino (ignoring inter-generational mixing), and yet its\ncoupling is reduced relative to the standard model. Similar reductions would occur for the\nmuon and tau neutrino interactions. The phenomenological implications of this reduction\nwill be discussed in the next Section.\n\nC.\n\nThe Additional Neutral Fermion Method\n\nIn some E6 -based superstring-based models, such as those with Calabi-Yau compactification, in addition to the 27 and 27 representations of E6 for the matter multiplets, there\ntypically exist split multiplets, parts of the 27 + 27 representations, as well as some E6\nsinglets 1 [44, 45, 46]. We have already considered the existence of such Higgs multiplets by\nconsidering 27 components of the above 27 + 27 representation inducing dimension-5 terms\n(of the form discussed in the previous subsection). In addition to the (27)3 and the higherdimensional (27 * 27)2 types of interactions, we may have 27 * 27 * 1 type of interactions as\nwell. The Additional Neutral Fermion (ANF) method follows this approach. The existence\nof E6 singlets (and thus the 27 * 27 * 1 interactions) has been discussed in different context of\nthe superstring models [38, 39, 40] to tackle the rapid proton decay problem, large neutrino\nmass problem and others. In order to give light neutrino masses consistent with present\nexperimental observations, the additional Higgs fields are required to have vev's chose in\na strong hierarchical way, which seems unnatural. Such an odd pattern, however, is not\nnecessary in the non-SUSY versions of the models discussed here. We discuss the method\nin the ALR symmetric model and later point out the difference with the Inert model.\nIn the ALR model, we consider one additional E6 neutral fermion singlet8 \u03c6, and one pair\nof 27 + 27 Higgs multiplets H + H (the Betti-Hodge number b1,1 = 1). We do not include\na corresponding 27 + 27 chiral fermion multiplet relevant for supersymmetrized versions of\nthe models considered in future studies.9 Let us assume that both H and H have \u03bd c -like\nand S c -like components H\u03bd c ,S c , H \u03bd c ,S c . Since we don't want to alter the interactions in the\n8\n\n9\n\nFor simplicity, we assume one additional field \u03c6 even when we extend our discussion to the three generation\ncase later in this section.\nIn principle, one can add such new fields and the corresponding interactions. We would like to be as\nconservative as possible as far as the number of new parameters are concerned.\n\n18\n\n\f(27)3 sector discussed earlier, we assume that only H \u03bd c ,S c get nonzero vev's and further, that\nthere is a Z2 discrete symmetry under which all fields except \u03c6, H\u03bd c ,S c and H \u03bd c ,S c have even\ncharges. Therefore, two additional gauge invariant interactions for one generation survive\nof the form\n\u2206L\u03c6ALR = \u03bbS SLc H S c \u03c6 + \u03bb\u03bd \u03bdLc H \u03bd c \u03c6 .\n\n(5.15)\n\nThen, the mass matrix in the neutral fermion sector in the (\u03bdL , NL , NLc , \u03bdLc , SLc , \u03c6) basis can\nbe obtained directly by adding a column and a row for \u03c6 field to the\n\uf8eb\n0\n0\n\u03bb2 N2 \u03bb2 v3\n0\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0\n0\n\u2212\u03bb1 N1 0 \u2212\u03bb1 v3 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec \u03bb2 N2 \u2212\u03bb1 N1\n0\n\u03bb2 v2 \u2212\u03bb1 v1 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nMneutral = \uf8ec\n\uf8ec \u03bb2 v3\n0\n\u03bb2 v2\n0\n0\n\u03bb\u03bd V\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0 \u2212\u03bb v \u2212\u03bb v\n0\n0\n\u03bbS \u03bc\n1 3\n1 1\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n0\n0\n0\n\u03bb\u03bd V \u03bbS \u03bc\n0\n\none given in Eq.

The parameter \u03b8 is arbitrary in the model, but it\n\nwould be fixed both by the requirement that the coupling of WL to neutrinos and leptons\nmust be in agreement with the experimental data and by the required mixing angle between\nactive and sterile neutrinos. The mass eigenstates |\u03bd3 i, |\u03bd4i, |\u03bd5 i, and |\u03bd6 i corresponding to\neigenvalues R3,4,5,6 respectively are heavy and irrelevant to our discussion at low energies.\nThere are two light mass eigenstates of the form\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u03bb\u03bd V c\n\u03bb2 N2\nmEE c\n|\u03bdL i \u2212\n|NL i + sin \u03b8\n|S i \u2212\n|\u03bd1 i = cos \u03b8\nR5\nR5\nR3 L\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u03bb2 N2\n\u03bb\u03bd V c\nmEE c\n|\u03bdL i \u2212\n|NL i \u2212 cos \u03b8\n|S i \u2212\n|\u03bd2 i = sin \u03b8\nR5\nR5\nR3 L\n\n\u0013\n\u03bbS \u03bc c\n|\u03bd i ,\nR3 L\n\u0013\n\u03bbS \u03bc c\n|\u03bd i .\nR3 L\n\n(5.19)\n\nThe above results apply to the Inert group, with an additional constraint coming from\nSU(2)I symmetry. Since \u03bdL and SLc form an SU(2)I doublet, the couplings \u03bb\u03bd and \u03bbS are\nrequired to be equal.\nThus, we have two interesting features of the model. The slight suppression of the coupling\nof the active neutrino discusssed in the last subsection is present. However, now we also\nhave a sterile neutrino with an arbitrary mixing angle with the active neutrino. This model\ncould then easily accommodate the LSND result (if confirmed by MiniBooNE).\nWith the addition of only one singlet, for simplicity, there are three active neutrinos.\nIn this case, \u03bbS and \u03bb\u03bd have generation indices. Each active neutrino has a light mass,\nand will mix with an arbitrary mixing angle with the sterile neutrino. Note that in the\nsingle-generation case, the two light mass eigenstates are, to leading order, identical. Thus,\nif the mixing angle is small for two of the three generations, we will have a 2 + 2 structure,\nwhereas if it is sizeable for all three generations, there will be a 3 + 1 structure. Of course,\none could introduce several singlet fields, giving more complicated structures.\n20\n\n\fVI.\n\nDISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS\n\nIf the LSND result is confirmed by MiniBooNE, the existence of sterile neutrino(s) at low\nenergies might be unavoidable. Thus is it important to analyze extensions of the Standard\nModel which predict the existence of extra neutral fermions, and verify that they have the\ndesired experimental features. Though we have explicitly considered here the E6 subgroups,\nSU(3)C \u2297SU(2)L \u2297SU(2)R\u2032 \u2297U(1)V (ALR) and SU(3)C \u2297SU(2)L \u2297SU(2)I \u2297U(1)Y (Inert),\nand concentrated on the neutrino spectrum in non-SUSY framework, our work is valid for\nthe SU(3)C \u2297 SU(2)L \u2297 SU(2)R \u2297 U(1)V (LR) group as well.\nThese models predict several exotic neutral fermions. We have shown that both the ALR\nand Inert models generally predict neutrino sectors inconsistent with current observations.\nThe lightest state turns out to contain only SU(2)L singlets (\u03bdLc and SLc ) which do not interact\nwith SM particles. Additionally, in contradiction with present experimental observations,\ntwo more light neutrino states with masses around the up quark mass exist. The main\nreason for such a spectrum is the existence of tree level Dirac mass term in the Lagrangian.\nWe have discussed three possible remedies to this problem.\nThe most attractive one is the Discrete Symmetry (DS) method which only requires\nimposing an extra symmetry. The aim is to eliminate the tree level Dirac mass term by\nassigning suitable charges to the fields under some discrete symmetries, and generate Dirac\nneutrino masses through radiative corrections. The discrete symmetry needs to distinguish\ngenerations. As discussed earlier, there is no way to induce a non-zero one-loop Dirac mass\nwhile eliminating the tree level term. The only way out is to have a SU(2)L Higgs doublet\n(a part of the bidoublet) with vanishing vev. For this, we considered the simplest symmetry,\nZ3 . It leads to Dirac masses from one-loop diagrams which are estimated around 10\u22121 eV,\nby imposing an upper bound to the product of the Yukawa couplings of the order of 10\u22128 .\nIt is also possible to generate very light Majorana masses for SLc and \u03bdLc . Since these masses\nare much smaller than the Dirac mass term for \u03bdL , a spectrum with pseudo-Dirac neutrinos\nis obtained.\nThe Higher Dimensional Operators (HDO), the second method, requires additional Higgs\nfields from 27-plet of E6 and the existence of some intermediate scale. We introduce interactions which are suppressed by one power of the compactification scale, through dimension-5\noperators. The method solves the mass problems but does not predict any sterile neutrino\n21\n\n\fcomponent(s) in the lightest neutrino state, which is an admixture of \u03bdL and NL . The effect\nof the mixing will be to lower the electron neutrino coupling to the electron and the WL\nboson by a factor of 1 \u2212 21 \u22062e , where \u2206e = \u03bb2 N2 /\u03bb1 N1 . The reduction for the muon and\ntau neutrino interactions will be given by the same expression, with \u2206e being replaced by\n\u2206\u03bc and \u2206\u03c4 (which depend on different \u03bbi and Ni ). The phenomenological implications are\ninteresting. If the \u2206i are different, then e \u2212 \u03bc \u2212 \u03c4 universality will be violated in neutrino\ninteractions. By comparing the muon decay rate and the rate for leptonic tau decays, one\nfinds [42, 43] that the reductions of 1 \u2212 12 \u22062i cannot differ by more than 0.005. Even if the\n\u2206i are all the same, however, one would still find a discrepancy in, for example, \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c0\u03bd\u03c4 vs.\n\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd \u03bc \u03bd\u03c4 , which would depend on \u2206\u03bc , with a similar dependence on the electronic decay.\nComparing all of these bounds, we find that none of the reductions can exceed 0.005, leading\nto a bound, for each generation, of \u03bb2 N2 /\u03bb1 N1 < 0.1, which is not particularly fine-tuned.\nA more detailed study comparing many hadronic decays with the leptonic decays of the \u03c4\ncould lead to a somewhat more precise bound (or, better yet, an indication of a discrepancy).\nThe last method we have discussed is the Additional Neutral Fermion (ANF), which\nrequires the existence of both new particles and discrete symmetries. If one considers an E6\nsinglet field, the additional interactions will be of the type 27 * 27 * 1, which further require\nadditional Higgs doublets from the 27 + 27 representation. In order not to alter already\nexisting couplings, the vev's of the new fields need to be chosen suitably, together with an\nadditional Z2 symmetry. Under these circumstances we obtain two light states given in\nEq. (5.19). The neutrino states have an active neutrino part of exactly the form predicted\nby the HDO method, but this time they mix with a sterile flavor state (formed by \u03bdLc and\nSLc ). The mixing is completely arbitrary. If we extend the picture to three generations, the\nmodel contains two structures, 2 + 2 and 3 + 1, which have been discussed extensively in\nthe literature [47]. When the above mixing is sizable only for one generation, only the 2 + 2\nstructure arises naturally, since the states in Eq. (5.19) are degenerate in the leading order.\nOtherwise, 3 + 1 is possible. More realistically, when we include three generations of \u03bdLc and\nSLc , we obtain a 3 + 3 structure.\nRecent analyses show that neither 2 + 2 nor 3 + 1 provide a good description of the\ncombined atmospheric, solar, reactor, and accelerator data even though it appears that\n3 + 1 works better. However, there is no consensus about whether the scenarios with four\nneutrinos are ruled out or not [15, 47]. From our considerations, the ANF method allows\n22\n\n\fboth 3 + 2 or 3 + 3 structures, which enhance the effects in favor of LSND data [15].\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nM.F. and I.T. thank NSERC of Canada for support under grant number 0105354, and\nM.S. thanks the National Science Foundation under grant PHY-0243400.\n\n[1] Q.
