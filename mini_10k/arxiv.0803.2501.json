Now take a n by n real matrix L such that:\n1) 0 < \u2212Lii , for all i \u2208 S,\n2) Lij \u2265 0, for all i 6= j, i \u2208 S,\nPn\n3)\ni=1 Lij = 0 for all fixed j \u2208 S.\n\nWe point out that, by convention, we are considering column stochastic matrices and\nnot line stochastic matrices (see [N] section 2 and 3 for general references).\nWe denote by P t = etL the semigroup generated by L. The left action of the semigroup\ncan be identified with an action over functions from S to R (vectors in Rn ) and the right\naction can be identified with action on measures on S (also vectors in Rn ).\nThe matrix etL is column stochastic, since from the assumptions on L follows that\n1\n(1, . . . , 1)etL = (1, . . . , 1)(I + tL + t2 L2 + * * * ) = (1, . . . , 1)\n2\nIt is well known that there exist a vector of probability p0 = (p10 , p20 , ..., pn0 ) \u2208 Rn such\nthat etL (p0 ) = P t p0 = p0 for all t > 0. The vector p0 is a right eigenvector of etL . All\nentries pi0 are strictly positive, as a consequence of hypothesis 1.\nWe point out that, if L(p0 ) = 0, then etL (p0 ) = p0 , for all t \u2265 0.\nNow let us consider the space \u03a9\u0303 = {1, 2, ..., n}R+ of all functions from R+ to S. In\nprinciple it could be enough for our purposes, but technical details in the construction of\nprobability measures on such a space force us to use a restriction of it: We consider the\nspace \u03a9 \u2282 \u03a9\u0303 as the set of right-continuous functions from R+ to S. In this set we take\nthe sigma algebra B generated by the cylinders of the form\n{w0 = a0 , wt1 = a1 , wt2 = a2 , ..., wtr = ar },\nwhere ti \u2208 R+ , r \u2208 Z+ , ai \u2208 S and 0 < t1 < t2 < . . . < tr . It is possible to endow \u03a9\nwith a metric, the Skorohod-Stone metric d, which makes \u03a9 complete and separable ([EK]\nsection 3.5) but the space is not compact.\nNow we can introduce a continuous time version of the shift map as follows: we\ndefine for each fixed s \u2208 R+ the B-measurable transformation \u0398s : \u03a9 \u2192 \u03a9 given by\n\u0398s (wt ) = wt+s (we remark that \u0398s is also a continuous transformation with respect to\nthe Skorohod-Stone metric d).\nFor L and p0 fixed as above we denote by P the probability on the sigma-algebra B\ndefined for cylinders by\nr\u22121\n...Pat22 a\u2212t1 1 Pat11a0 pa00 .\nP ({w0 = a0 , wt1 = a1 , ..., wtr = ar }) = Patrr a\u2212tr\u22121\n\nFor details of the construction of this measure the reader is refered to [B].\n2\n\n\fThe probability P on (\u03a9, B) is stationary in the sense that for any integrable function\nf and any s \u2265 0\nZ\nZ\nf (w)dP (w) =\n\n(f \u25e6 \u0398s )dP (w).\n\nFrom now on the Stationary Process defined by P is denoted by Xt and all functions\nf we consider are in the set L\u221e (P ).\nThere exist a version of P such that for a set of full measure all elements w are locally\nconstant on t on the right side with left and right limits and w is right continuous on t.\nWe consider from now on such P .\nFrom P we are able to define a continuous time Ruelle operator Lt , t > 0, acting\non functions f : \u03a9 \u2192 R of L\u221e (P ). It is also possible to introduce the endomorphism\n\u03b1t : L\u221e (P ) \u2192 L\u221e (P ) defined as\n\u2200\u03c6 \u2208 L\u221e (P )\n\n\u03b1t (\u03c6) = \u03c6 \u25e6 \u0398t ,\n\nGiven V : \u03a9 \u2192 R, such that it is constant in sets of the form {X0 = c} (i.e., V depends\nonly on the value of x(0)), we are able to show the existence of a probability \u03c1V on \u03a9\nwhich is absolutely continuous with respect to P and satisfies:\nTheorem A. For any integrable f \u2208 L\u221e (P ) and any positive t\nZ\nZ\nRt\nR\n(V\n\u25e6\u0398\n)(.)ds\nt\n\u2212 0t (V \u25e6\u0398s )(.)ds\ns\nf ) ) \u25e6 \u03b8t ]d\u03c1V = f d\u03c1V\n[ (L (e 0\ne\nThe above functional equation is a natural generalization (for continuous time) of the\nsimilar one presented in [EL1] and [EL2]. We believe it will be important in the analysis\nof certain C \u2217 algebras, generated by the operators \u03b1 and L, specially concerning the\ncharacterization of KMS states. We point out however that we are able to show this\nproperty of \u03c1V just for a quite simple function V as above.\nWith the operators \u03b1 and L we can rewrite the theorem above as\n\u03c1V (G\u22121\nT ET (GT \u03c6)) = \u03c1V (\u03c6)\nR\nfor all \u03c6 \u2208 L\u221e and all T > 0, where, as usual, \u03c1V (\u03c6) = \u03c6d\u03c1V , ET = \u03b1T LT is in fact a\nprojection on a subalgebra of B and GT : \u03a9 \u2192 R is given by\nZ T\nGT (x) = exp (\nV (x(s))ds)\n0\n\nFor the map V : \u03a9 \u2192 R, which is constant in cylinders of the form {w0 = i},\ni \u2208 {1, 2, ..., n}, we denote by Vi the corresponding value. We denote also by V the\ndiagonal matrix with the i-diagonal element equal to Vi .\nWe denote by PVt = et(L+V ) . The Perron-Frobenius Theorem for such semigroup will\nbe one of the main ingredients of the proof.\nA related and more general result will appear in [LNT].\n3\n\n\fAs usual we denote by Fs the sigma-algebra generated by Xs . We also denote by Fs+\nthe sigma-algebra generated \u03c3({Xu , s \u2264 u}). Note that a Fs+ -measurable function f (w)\non \u03a9 does depend of the value ws .\nWe also denote by IA the indicator function of a measurable set A in \u03a9.\n\n2\n\nA continuous time Ruelle Operator\n\nWe consider the disintegration of P given by the family of measures, indexed by the\nelements of \u03a9 and t > 0 defined as follows: first, consider a sequence 0 = t0 < t1 < * * * <\ntj\u22121 < t \u2264 tj < * * * < tr .

The definition above can be rewritten as\nZ\nt\nL (\u03c6)(x) =\n\u03c6(yx)d\u03bcxt (yx)\ny\u2208D[0,t)\n\nwhere the symbol yx means the concatenation of the path y with the translation of x:\n\u001a\ny(s)\nif s \u2208 [0, t)\nxy(s) =\nx(s \u2212 t)\nif s \u2265 t\nand D[0, t) is the set of right-continuous functions from [0, t) to S. This follows simply\nfrom the fact that, in this notation, \u0398\u22121\nt (x) = {yx : y \u2208 D[0, t)}.\nIt is possible to shed some light on the meaning of this operator applying it to some\nsimple functions. For example, we can see the effect of Lt on some indicator of a given\ncylinder: Consider the sequence 0 = t0 < t1 < .. < tj\u22121 < t \u2264 tj < ... < tr and then take\nf = I{X0 =a0 ,Xt1 =a1 ,...,Xtr =ar } . Then, for a path z \u2208 \u03a9 such that ztj \u2212t = aj , ..., ztr \u2212t = ar\n(the future condition) we have\nLt (f )(z) =\n\n1 t\u2212tj\u22121\nP\n...Pat22a\u2212t1 1 Pat11a0 pa00 ,\npz00 z0 aj\u22121\n\notherwise (i.e., if the path z does not satisfy the condition above) we get Lt (f )(z) = 0.\nNote that if tr < t, then Lt (f )(z) depends only on z0 . For example, if f = I{X0 =i0 }\nthen\nZ\n1\nt\nL (f )(z) =\nI{X0 =i0 } (yx)d\u03bczt (yx) = \u03bczt ([X0 = i0 ]) = z0 Pzt0 ,i0 pi00\np0\ny\u2208D[0,t)\np\n\ni0\n\nIn the case f = I{X0 =i0 ,Xt =j0 } , then Lt (f )(z) = Pzt0 ,i0 pz00 , if z0 = j0 , and Lt (f )(z) = 0\n0\notherwise.\nNow we can show some properties of Lt .\nProposition 2.4. Lt (1) = 1, where 1 is the function that maps every point in \u03a9 to 1.\nProof: Indeed\nt\n\nL (1)(x) =\n\nZ\n\nn\nX\n\n1(yx)d\u03bcxt (yx)\n\n=\n\ny\u2208D[0,t)\n\n\u03bcxt ([X0\n\nZ\n\n= a, Xt = x(0)]) =\n\na=1\n\nd\u03bcxt (yx) = \u03bcxt ([Xt = x(0)]) =\nn\n1 X\n\nx(0)\np0 a=1\n\nt\nPx(0)a\npa0 = 1\n\nWe can also define the dual of Lt , denoted by (Lt )\u2217 , acting on the measures. Then we\nget:\n5\n\n\fProposition 2.5. For any positive t we have that (Lt )\u2217 (P ) = (P )\nProof: For a fixed t we have that (Lt )\u2217 (P ) = (P ) because for any f of the form\nf = I{X0 =a0 ,Xt1 =a1 ,...,Xtr =ar } , 0 = t0 < t1 < .. < tj\u22121 < t \u2264 tj < ... < tr . we have\nZ\nn Z\nX\nt\nL (f )(z)dP (z) =\nLt (f )(z)dP (z) =\n{X0 =b}\n\nb=1\n\nn Z\nX\n\nI{X0 =b,Xtj \u2212t =aj ,...,Xtr \u2212t =ar } (z)dP (z)\n\nb=1\nn\nX\n\n1 t\u2212tj\u22121\n...Pat22a\u2212t1 1 Pat11a0 pa00 =\nP\npb0 baj\u22121\n\nP ({X0 = b, Xtj \u2212t = aj , ..., Xtr \u2212t = ar })\n\nb=1\n\nZ\n\n1 t\u2212tj\u22121\n...Pat22a\u2212t1 1 Pat11a0 pa00 =\nP\npb0 baj\u22121\n\nf (w)dP (w).\n\nProposition 2.6. Given t \u2208 R+ and the functions \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 L\u221e (P ) then we have\nLt (\u03c6 \u00d7 (\u03c8 \u25e6 \u0398t ))(z) = \u03c8(z) \u00d7 Lt (\u03c6)(z).\nProof:\nt\n\nL (\u03c6(\u03c8 \u25e6 \u0398t ))(x) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03c6(ix)(\u03c8 \u25e6 \u0398t )(ix)d\u03bcxt (i) =\n\ni\u2208D[0,t)\n\n\u03c8(x)\n\nZ\n\n\u03c6(ix)d\u03bcxt (i) = (\u03c8Lt (\u03c6))(x) = \u03c8(x)Lt (\u03c6)(x)\n\nsince \u03c8 \u25e6 \u0398t (ix) = \u03c8(x), independently of i.\nWe just recall that the last proposition can be restated as\nLt (\u03c6\u03b1t (\u03c8)) = \u03c8Lt (\u03c6)\nThen we get:\nProposition 2.7. \u03b1t is the dual of Lt on L2 (P ).\nProof: From last two propositions\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nt\nt\nL (f )g dP = L (f \u00d7 (g \u25e6 \u0398t )) dP = f \u00d7 (g \u25e6 \u0398t ) dP = f \u03b1t (g)dP\n\nas claimed.\n\nNow we would like to obtain conditional expectations. For a given f recall that the\nfunction Z(w) = E(f |Ft+ ) is the Z (almost everywhere\ndefined) Ft+\nR\nR -measurable function\nsuch that for any Ft+ -measurable set B we have B Z(w)dP (w) = B f (w)dP (w).\n6\n\n\fProposition 2.8. The conditional expectation is given by\nZ\n+\nE(f |Ft )(x) = f d\u03bcxt\n\nProof: For t fixed, consider a Ft+ -measurable set B. Then we have\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ Z\n+\nw\nE(f |Ft )dP =\nf d\u03bct dP (w) = (IB (w) f d\u03bcw\nt )dP (w) =\nB\nB\nZ Z\nZ\nZ\nw\n(f IB )d\u03bct dP (w) = f (w)IB (w)dP (w) = f dP,\n\nand the proposition is concluded.\n\nNow we can relate the conditional expectation with respect to the \u03c3-algebras Ft+ with\nthe operators cLt and \u03b1t as follows:\nProposition 2.9. [Lt (f )](\u0398t ) = E(f |Ft+ ) (i.e. E = \u03b1t Lt ).\nProof: This follows from the fact that for any B = {Xs1 = b1 , Xs2 = b2 , ..., Xsu = bu },\nwith t < s1 < ... < su , we have IB = IA \u25e6 \u0398t for some measurable A and\nZ\nZ\nt\nL (f )(\u0398t (w))dP (w) = IB (w)Lt (f )(\u0398t (w))dP (w) =\nB\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nt\n\n(IA \u25e6 \u0398t )(w)L (f )(\u0398t (w))dP (w) = IA (w)Lt (f )(w)dP (w)\nZ\nZ\nZ\nt\nf (w)dP (w)\nL (f (IA \u25e6 \u0398t ))(w)dP (w) = f (w)IA (\u0398t (w))dP (w) =\nB\n\n3\n\nThe modified operator\n\nWe are interested in the perturbation by V (defined above) of the Lt operator.\nDefinition 3.1. We define Gt : \u03a9 \u2192 R as\nGt (x) = exp (\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nV (x(s))ds)\n0\n\nDefinition 3.2. We define the G-weigthed transfer operator LtV : L\u221e (\u03a9, P ) \u2192 L\u221e (\u03a9, P )\nacting on measurable functions f (of the above form) by\nLtV (f )(w) := Lt (Gt f ) =\nRt\n\n= Lt (e\n\n0\n\n(V \u25e6\u0398s )(.)ds\n\nf)=\n\nn\nX\n\nRt\n\nLt (e\n\nb=1\n\n7\n\n0\n\n(V \u25e6\u0398s )(.)ds\n\nI{Xt =b} f )(w)\n\n\fRt\n\nNote that e 0 (V \u25e6\u0398s )(.)ds I{Xt =b} does not depend on information larger then t. In the\ncase f is such that tr \u2264 t (in the above notation), then LtV (f )(w) depends only on w(0).\nThe integration on s above is over the open interval (0, t).\nRemember that if L(p0 ) = 0, then etL (p0 ) = p0 for all t \u2265 0.\nWe will consider soon an eigenfunction and an eigen-measure for the operator LtV .\nBut, first we need the following:\nTheorem 1.
