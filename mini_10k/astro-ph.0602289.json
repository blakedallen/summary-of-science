INTRODUCTION\n\nA main-sequence or giant star passing near a massive black\nhole (MBH) of mass Mbh . 108 M\u2299 is disrupted by the tidal\nforces (Hills 1975). The disruption and the subsequent accretion of stellar debris by the black hole are potential powerful sources of X-ray emission (e.g., M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros & Silk 1977;\nYoung et al. 1977; Rees 1988, 1990). The emission can\nbe produced in various phases of tidal disruption, including\nthe initial compression of the star (Kobayashi et al. 2004),\nthe interaction of ejected debris with the ambient medium\n(Khokhlov & Melia 1996), in tidal stream collisions and debris fallback onto a nascent accretion disk (Kochanek 1994;\nLee et al. 1996; Kim et al. 1999; Li et al. 2002), and in the\naccretion of disk material onto the black hole (Cannizzo et al.\n1990; Ulmer 1999). The purpose of the present study is to\nestimate the contribution of activity associated with tidal disruptions to the luminosities of typical active galaxies.\nRecently, surveys with HEAO 1, ASCA, Chandra, and\nXMM-Newton have yielded luminosity functions (LFs) of\nactive galaxies at low and high redshift in the hard\n(e.g., Ueda et al. 2003; Barger et al. 2005) and soft (e.g.,\nHasinger et al. 2005) X-rays. The measured X-ray LFs extend\nto lower luminosities than their optical counterparts because\ncontamination with host galaxy light makes optical detection\nof low-luminosity AGN difficult. The LFs are approximately\nbroken power laws dN/d ln LX \u221d L\u03bcX (LX +LX\u22c6 )\u03bd\u2212\u03bc with \u03bd \u2248 \u22122\nand \u22121 . \u03bc . 0 and LX\u22c6 \u223c 1043 \u2212 1044 ergs s\u22121 . The powerlaw behavior at the bright end has been attributed to the intrinsic structure of quasar luminosity histories. The luminosity histories (light curves) are convolved with the black hole\nmass function to calculate the LF (e.g., Wyithe & Loeb 2003;\nHopkins et al. 2005). The origin of the LF at the faint end,\n1 Theoretical Astrophysics, Mail Code 130-33, California Institute of\nTechnology, 1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, CA 91125.\n2 Hubble Fellow.\n3 Department of Physics, Rochester Institute of Technology, 84 Lomb\nMemorial Drive, Rochester, NY 14623.\n4 Observatories of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, 813 Santa Barbara Street, Pasadena, CA 91101.\n\nhowever, remains unknown.\nAt least a fraction of low-luminosity AGN must be powered\nby stellar tidal disruption. Here we estimate the contribution\nof these sources to the X-ray LF of AGN. This estimate is an\nessential step to understanding the origin of activity in AGN\nwith black hole masses . 107 M\u2299 and ultimately to understanding the origin of low-mass MBHs.\nTheoretical investigations of the stellar tidal disruption\nprocess, and the detection X-ray flares that are candidate tidal disruption events (e.g., Komossa & Greiner 1999;\nKomossa et al. 2004b; Halpern et al. 2004), suggest that the\nnuclei in which stellar tidal disruption has occurred remain\nluminous for 1 \u2212 10 yrs after disruption or longer. The integrated luminosity of the AGN depends on the mass of the\nstellar debris that remains bound to the black hole, and on\nthe fraction of this mass that ends up accreting onto the black\nhole in a radiatively-efficient fashion. The bound mass can be\na fraction f \u223c 0.25 \u2212 5 of the initial stellar mass (Ayal et al.\n2000).\nThe bound mass inferred in the giant X-ray flare in NGC\n5905 using a black-body fallback model is much smaller than\nthe solar mass (Li et al. 2002); in two other candidate flares,\nRX J1624.9+7554 and RX J1242.6\u22121119A, the light curves\nare consistent with masses \u223c M\u2299 . Donley et al. (2002) constrained the rate of outbursts by comparing the ROSAT AllSky Survey with archival pointed observations. They inferred\na rate of \u223c 10\u22125 yr\u22121 per galaxy. We adopt a theoretical estimate for the tidal disruption rate that is significantly higher\n(eq. 1).\nThe outline of our calculation of the AGN LF is as follows.\nIn \u00a7 2.1, we estimate the mass function of MBHs and the rate\nof tidal disruptions. In \u00a7 2.2, we present simple models for the\nlight curves of tidally disrupted stars. In \u00a7 2.3, we calculate\nthe LF and explore its dependence on various parameters in\nthe model. In \u00a7 3, we discuss implications of our estimate for\nthe understanding of low-luminosity, X-ray selected AGN.\n2. CALCULATION OF THE LUMINOSITY FUNCTION\n2.1. Tidal Disruption Rate\n\n\f2\n\nAGN LUMINOSITY FUNCTION\n\nStars passing within distance (\u03b7 2 Mbh /m\u22c6 )1/3 R\u22c6 of the black\nhole, where m\u22c6 is the mass of the star, R\u22c6 is its radius, and\n\u03b7 \u223c 1 is a numerical factor, are tidally disrupted. Here we\nestimate the tidal disruption rate in a galaxy with black hole\nof mass Mbh and stellar velocity dispersion \u03c3. The disruption\nrate depends on the detailed structure of the stellar nucleus\nof the galaxy. The galaxies relevant to this study are those\nwith Mbh . Mmax \u2261 108 M\u2299 (R\u22c6 /R\u2299 )3/2 (m\u22c6 /M\u2299 )\u22121/2 which\ncan disrupt stars.\nIn spheroids as faint as that of the Milky Way, the relaxation time within the black hole's radius of dynamical influence rbh \u223c GMbh /\u03c3 2 is short enough that a collisionallyrelaxed distribution, \u03c1 \u221d r\u2212\u03b3 , where \u03b3 \u223c 1.5 \u2212 1.75, is\nset up (Bahcall & Wolf 1976, 1977; Merritt & Szell 2005).\nThis is consistent with what is seen at the Galactic Center\n(Genzel et al. 2003; Sch\u00f6del et al. 2006). But just beyond rbh ,\nthe Galactic Center density profile steepens to \u03c1 \u221d r\u22122 , and\nthis is also the slope observed with the Hubble Space Telescope near the centers of all but the most luminous galaxies (Gebhardt et al. 1996; Ferrarese et al. 2006). Furthermore,\nnuclear relaxation times in galaxies with Mbh & 107 M\u2299 generally exceed a Hubble time (Faber et al. 1997) and so a\nBahcall-Wolf cusp would not form.\nThe rate of stellar disruptions in stellar density cusps has\nbeen studied at various levels of detail (e.g., Frank & Rees\n1976; Lightman & Shapiro 1977; Cohn & Kulsrud 1978;\nMagorrian & Tremaine 1999). We adopt the most recent estimate of the rate in a \u03c1 \u221d r\u22122 cusp (Wang & Merritt 2004)\n\u0012\n\n\u03c3\n\u0393(Mbh ) \u2248 7 \u00d7 10 yr\n70 km s\u22121\n\u0013\u22121/3 \u0012\n\u00131/4\n\u0012\nR\u22c6\nm\u22c6\n\u00d7\n,\nM\u2299\nR\u2299\n\u22124\n\n\u22121\n\n\u00137/2 \u0012\n\nMbh\n106 M\u2299\n\n\u0013\u22121\n(1)\n\nwhere m\u22c6 and R\u22c6 are the mass and radius of the tidally disrupted stars.\nThe disruption rate in equation (1) must be weighted by\nthe stellar mass function in the spheroid at distances from\nthe black hole corresponding to the initial pericenter radii of\ntidally disrupted stars. These radii are typically similar to rbh\n(Magorrian & Tremaine 1999). If the stellar mass function resembles the \"universal\" initial mass function (Kroupa 2001),\nthe disruption is dominated by m\u22c6 \u223c 0.1M\u2299 stars. However,\nthe mass function near the black hole may differ from the universal initial mass function because higher-mass stars dynamically segregate closer to MBH, and because stars with an unusual initial mass function may form in situ near the MBH\n(e.g., Milosavljevi\u0107 & Loeb 2004, and references therein).\nMounting observational evidence indicates that the black\nhole mass and the velocity dispersion of the host stellar\nspheroid are tightly correlated with best-fit relation Mbh \u2248\n1.7 \u00d7 108M\u2299 (\u03c3/200 km s\u22121 )4.9 (e.g., Ferrarese & Ford 2005,\nand references therein). We explore departures from this fiducial relation by parameterizing the logarithmic slope of the\nrelation Mbh \u221d \u03c3 a .\nNo direct constraints on the cosmic density of MBH with\nmasses . 107 M\u2299 exist. The majority of these MBH should\nbe in spiral galaxies. The density can be estimated by assuming a relation between the bulge luminosity and the black\nk\nhole mass of the form Lbulge = AMbh\n. Following Ferrarese\n(2002), we substitute this in the Schechter LF \u03a6(L)dL =\n\u03a60 (L/L\u22c6 )\u03b1 e\u2212L/L\u22c6 dL/L\u22c6 to obtain a cosmic mass function of\n\nblack holes\n\u03a8(Mbh )dMbh = \u03a80\n\n\u0012\n\nMbh\nM\u22c6\n\n\u0013k(\u03b1+1)\u22121\n\ne\u2212(Mbh /M\u22c6 )\n\nk\n\ndMbh\nM\u22c6\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03a80 = k\u03a60 , M\u22c6 = (1.27 \u03b2L\u22c6 /A)1/k , and \u03b2 \u2261 Lbulge /L \u223c\n0.3 for the Hubble type Sab (Simien & de Vaucouleurs 1986)\nwhich we use as reference. The latter is justified because spiral galaxies dominate galaxy LF below \u223c L\u22c6 (e.g.,\nNakamura et al. 2003). For the relation between the blue luminosity of the galaxy and the black hole mass we adopt\nL = 3900L\u2299(Mbh /M\u2299 )0.79 (Marconi & Hunt 2003).\nThe number density of \u223c 108 M\u2299 black holes estimated using equation (2) agrees with a similar estimate in\nMarconi et al. (2004), while the number density of \u223c 106 M\u2299\nblack holes exceeds their estimate by a factor \u223c 3 \u2212 4. This\nmay be a consequence of our using the B-band galaxy LF\nas reference, whereas Marconi et al. (2004) use the K-band\nLF that is flatter at the faint end. However our adoption of a\nsteeper Mbh \u2013\u03c3 relation than they do has an opposite effect.\n2.2. The Light Curve of a Tidal Disruption Event\n\nThe light curves of candidate tidal disruption events\n(Komossa et al. 2004b) are characterized by rapid fall in Xray luminosity on time scales of months to a year, followed by\na gradual continued fading over the following decade. Three\nof the four candidate events (NGC 5905, RX J1420+53, RX\nJ1242\u221211) are consistent with luminosity decay Lfb \u221d t \u22125/3\nexpected if the X-ray emission is produced during the fallback\nof stellar debris onto a nascent accretion disk (Phinney 1989;\nEvans & Kochanek 1989). The fourth event RX J1624+75 exhibits what appears to be faster initial decay followed by very\nslow fading. In all cases, the total drop in X-ray luminosity is\nby a factor \u223c 102 \u2212 103 over about a decade.\nThe above candidate tidal disruption events have been selected for characteristic, \"outburst\"-like light curves (fast rise\nand slow decay). However the true luminosity evolution of\ntidal disruption events is unknown. If the emission during the\nfallback stage is absorbed or otherwise suppressed, the X-ray\nlight curve will be dominated by thin disk accretion and a\nquasi-steady flux over a longer period will be expected. Such\nevents would remain undetected in existing searches that target outburst activity. To maintain generality, therefore, we\nconsider fallback-like power-law light curves, and also discuss constant accretion rate models.\nThe power irradiated during fallback was derived in Li et al.\n(2002)\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\nMbh\nf\nLbol \u2248 4 \u00d7 1042 ergs s\u22121\n0.25\n106 M\u2299\n\u0013\u22125/3\n\u0012\n\u00132/3 \u0012\nm\u22c6\nt\n\u00d7\n,\n(3)\nM\u2299\n1 yr\nwhere the tidal disruption occurs at t = 0, and the luminosity reaches peak value and starts decaying as in equation (3)\nat time tpeak \u2248 0.02(Mbh /106 M\u2299 )1/2 (m\u22c6 /M\u2299 )\u22121 (R\u22c6 /R\u2299 )3/2 yr\nafter tidal disruption.\nAlthough equation (3) was derived for the fallback process,\nwe interpret it as a representative power-law decay model for\nthe luminosity evolution, independent of the emission mechanism To test the sensitivity to the power law index of luminosity decay, we consider decay of the form Lbol \u221d t \u2212\u03bb , where\n\u03bb > 1 is a constant. We also test the sensitivity to the value of\ntpeak by scaling it via tpeak (\u03be) = \u03betpeak (0). In both cases we keep\n\n\fMILOSAVLJEVI\u0106 ET AL.\nthe total energy irradiated between t = tpeak and t = \u221e constant\nand equal to f m\u22c6 c2 .\nWe also discuss an alternative to power-law light curves.\nAccurate theoretical modeling of a time-dependent thin disk\nemission is difficult. We therefore adopt a crude quasi-steady\naccretion scenario, in which we assume that accretion at constant rate proceeds \"while the supplies last,\" i.e., until all the\nbound debris has been accreted. This is inevitably an oversimplification. Taking into account the redistribution of mass\nin the disk, Cannizzo et al. (1990) estimate that under certain\nassumptions the light curve will be Ldisk \u221d t \u22121.2 . On the other\nhand, if outer parts of the disk become thermally unstable\nand neutral, the accretion may be delayed (Menou & Quataert\n2001).\nIn the \"while the supplies last\" constant-accretion scenario,\nwe assume that the luminosity is a fraction l of the Eddington\nluminosity LEdd (Mbh ), and that the luminosity is related to the\nmass accretion rate via L = \u01eb\u1e40c2 , where as usual \u01eb parameterizes radiative efficiency. The duration of the active phase\nis then \u2206tactive = \u01eb f m\u22c6 c2 /lLEdd , implying a model luminosity\nLbol (Mbh ,t) = lLEdd H(\u2206tactive \u2212 t), where H(x) is the Heaviside\nstep function.\n2.3. Integration over the Black Hole Mass Function\n\nThe LF of tidal disruption events is obtained by weighting\nthe disruption probability modeled as a Poisson process by the\nblack hole mass function. In the fallback model, the LF reads\nZ \u221e\nZ Mmax (m\u22c6 )\ndMbh\ndt \u03a8(Mbh ) \u0393(Mbh )e\u2212\u0393(Mbh )t\n\u03a8(LX ) =\nMmin\n\ntpeak (Mbh )\n\n\u00d7\u03b4[\u03c9 \u22121 Lbol (Mbh ,t) \u2212 LX],\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c9 is the bolometric correction, \u03b4(x) is the Dirac \u03b4function, and the dependence on f and m\u22c6 is implicitly assumed; for the radius of subsolar stars we adopt the relation R\u22c6 = R\u2299 (m\u22c6 /M\u2299 )0.8 (e.g., Kippenhahn & Weigert 1990).\nHere, Mmin is the minimum MBH mass, and as before Mmax \u221d\nm\u22c60.7 is the maximum MBH mass near which a star can be disrupted. We take Mmin = 104 M\u2299 , as systems in which an even\nsmaller black hole is expected have been found to lack one\n(e.g., Merritt et al. 2001; Valluri et al. 2005). For the bolometric correction in the 0.5 \u2212 2 keV band, we take \u03c9 = 45,\nwhich at low luminosities is approximately independent of\nluminosity (Marconi et al. 2004, and references therein), although in reality the bolometric correction could be correlated\nwith Lbol /LEdd rather than Lbol .\nIn Figure 1, we plot the resulting LF for our fiducial model\nwith a light curve that decays as a power-law L \u221d t \u2212\u03bb with\n\u03bb = 53 . The model is based on a galaxy LF with amplitude \u03a60 =\n0.02 h\u22123 Mpc\u22123 and absolute blue magnitude of an L\u22c6 galaxy\nof MB\u22c6 = \u221220.0 + 5 log10 h (Blanton et al. 2001), where we assume h = 0.7. We vary the various parameters, including \u03bb in\nFigure 1d, to explore the sensitivity of the X-ray AGN LF to\nour choice of the fiducial model. In the low-luminosity regime\nLX \u226a Lpeak \u2261 \u03c9 \u22121 Lbol [m\u22c6 ,tpeak (m\u22c6 )], the LF is a power-law\n1/3\n\u22121/\u03bb\u22121\n. At LX & Lpeak \u223c 1044 (\u03c9/45)\u22121m\u22c6 ergs s\u22121 ,\n\u03a6(LX ) \u221d LX\nthe LF drops precipitously.\nBelow LX \u223c 1044 ergs s\u22121 , the calculated X-ray AGN LF\nslightly overestimates but is roughly compatible with the soft\nX-ray AGN LF of Hasinger et al. (2005) (shown in the figure), and is a factor of a few lower than the hard X-ray AGN\nLF (Ueda et al. 2003; Barger et al. 2005). The discrepancy\nbetween the soft and hard X-ray LF could be attributed to an\n\n3\n\nincompleteness of the soft X-ray LF resulting from obscuration.\nIn models with power-law decaying light curves, the lowluminosity slope of the AGN LF is determined by the powerlaw of the decay, rather than the shape of the black hole mass\nfunction (Fig. 1d). The amplitude of the LF, however, is sensitive to the black hole mass function. The steep drop in the\nLF around 1044 ergs s\u22121 is associated with the peak luminosity produced in a tidal disruption event, which corresponds to\nthe peak mass inflow rate from the debris that is beginning to\ncircularize around the black hole (Fig. 1a,h).\nIn the \"while the supplies last\" model, where the accretion\nluminosity is a constant and equal to lLEdd , the LF reads\n\u01eb \u03c3T c m\u22c6\n\u0393(M1 )\u03a8(M1 ),\n(5)\n\u03a8(LX ) \u2248\nl 4\u03c0Gmp LX\nfor Mmin < M1 < Mmax , where M1 = \u03c9\u03c3T LX /4\u03c0lGmp c. In\nthe low luminosity regime, the LF is a power law \u03a8(LX ) \u221d\n\u22123+7/2a+(\u03b1+1)k 1\u22127/2a\u2212(\u03b1+1)k\nl\n, which assuming a constant l is\nLX\nsteeper, LX \u03a8(LX ) \u221d L\u22121.5\nX , than the observed relation (\u03bc >\n\u22121), although the two LFs have comparable amplitudes at\nLX \u223c 1043 ergs s\u22121 . The discrepancy may reflect a luminositydependent Eddington ratio l. The dependence of l on luminosity or black hole mass is expected if the accretion rate is\nsupply limited, rather than radiatively limited. For example,\nto reproduce \u03a8(LX ) \u221d L\u22122\nX , we must have l \u221d LX . At present\nit is not clear how such dependence should arise.\n3. DISCUSSION\n\nWhile many theoretical uncertainties frustrate an accurate\nestimate of the contribution of activity associated with stellar\ntidal disruption to the X-ray LF of active galaxies, it seems\nthat the contribution can be significant at low luminosities\nLX . 1044 ergs s\u22121 . The tidal disruption activity makes a negligible contribution at higher luminosities (power-law profile\nof the measured soft X-ray LF extends to LX \u223c 1047.5 ergs s\u22121\nat redshifts z \u223c 1 \u2212 3). MBHs with masses above \u223c 107 M\u2299\ngrow by accreting non-stellar material from the interstellar\nmedium.\nWhat is the origin of the featureless knee in the LF at\nLX \u223c (1043 \u2212 1044 ) ergs s\u22121 ? The location of the knee coincides with Eddington-limited accretion onto black holes\nwith masses Mbh \u223c 106\u22127 M\u2299 .1 Given the tidal disruption\nrate assumed here (eq. 1), black holes with masses Mbh .\n2 \u00d7 106( f /0.25)M\u2299, where f is the fraction of the stellar mass\nthat ultimately gets accreted onto the MBH, could have grown\nto their present size by accreting stellar debris over a Hubble\ntime, although undoubtedly, non-stellar accretion must have\nplayed a role. This critical mass is compatible with the location of the knee in the LF assuming near-Eddington accretion.\nBlack holes with masses \u223c 107 M\u2299 , in turn, roughly lie at\nthe demarcation line separating the dominance of late-type\nand early-type galaxies. If major mergers are responsible for\ndiverting gas into accretion onto black holes in early type\ngalaxies, then the absence of merging activity in late-type\ngalaxies leaves stellar tidal disruption as competitive supplier\nof material to the MBH. This may explain why the steep\npower-law behavior of the quasar LF fails to extend to lower\nluminosities.\nThe observed X-ray LF of AGN evolves with redshift. The\nnumber density of low-luminosity AGN increases by a factor\n1 The maximum accretion rate might exceed the Eddington limit by a factor of a few (e.g., Begelman 2002).\n\n\f4\n\nAGN LUMINOSITY FUNCTION\n\nF IG . 1.- The X-ray LF of tidal disruptions calculated using equation (4) assuming a bolometric correction \u03c9 = 45 and a light curve that decays\nas a power-law \u03bb = 35 .

We also show the low-redshift (0.015 < z < 0.2) soft X-ray (0.5\u22122 keV)\nLF data from the Chandra and XMM-Newton survey of Hasinger et al. (2005). A Hubble constant of H0 = 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 is assumed throughout.\n\nof \u223c (10, 4) at LX \u223c (1042 , 1043 ) ergs s\u22121 from z \u223c 0 to z \u223c 0.7\nin the soft X-rays (0.5 \u2212 2 keV; Hasinger et al. 2005), while\nthe respective increase is only a factor \u223c 2 \u2212 3 in the hard\nX-rays (2 \u2212 8 keV; Barger et al. 2005). The location of the\nknee shifts from LX \u223c 1043 ergs s\u22121 to LX \u223c 1044 ergs s\u22121 from\nz \u223c 0 to z \u223c 1 in the soft and hard band alike, and the break\nbecomes more prominent at higher redshift. These trends require explanation.\nThe number density of tidal-disruption powered sources\ncould increase with redshift because of one or more of the\nfollowing reasons: 1. On average, MBHs are smaller at larger\nredshift, implying a larger tidal disruption rate or, speculatively, a higher radiative efficiency in the soft X-ray band;2 2.\nGalactic nuclei were denser at larger redshift (or, equivalently,\nstellar velocity dispersions were higher at fixed MBH mass),\nalso implying a larger tidal disruption rate; and 3. Tidally\ndisrupted stars were more massive at larger redshift, implying\nbrighter events.3 Any one or all of these factor may contribute\nto the observed trend at low luminosities, and could also be\nresponsible for the apparent brightening of the location of the\nknee of the LF.\nIn particular, if MBH grew gradually in pre-existing stellar\ndensity cusps with fixed velocity dispersions, then the tidal\ndisruption rate would be inversely proportional to the black\nhole mass (eq. 1) and would increase with redshift. This could\nexplain the increase in the number density of low-luminosity\nAGN from the nearby universe to z \u223c 0.7.\n2 Note that for black holes smaller than M . 106 M , thermal emission\n\u2299\nbh\nfrom an Eddington-limited disk enters the soft X-ray band, and the soft X-ray\nluminosity is thus anticorrelated with mass. It is also possible that transition\nfrom high to low-state accretion is sensitive to Mbh .\n3 The remaining possibility, an increase of the number of black holes in\n\nThe relative contribution of stellar tidal disruptions to the\nX-ray AGN LF can be studied by examining long-term Xray variability of the sources. Currently, long-term monitoring data have been analyzed for only a handful of sources\n(e.g., Markowitz & Edelson 2004). Theoretical uncertainty\nnotwithstanding, the light curves of tidal disruption events\nshould be characterized by a fast rise and slow decay, but\nthe variability may or may not be detected as an outburst.\nThe frequency of hard X-ray outbursts in the ROSAT All-Sky\nSurvey was studied by Donley et al. (2002). Their estimate,\n\u223c 10\u22125 yr\u22121 per galaxy, is significantly below the tidal disruption rate adopted by us. The rates can be reconciled if the\nmajority of tidal disruptions do not exhibit outburst characteristics. In that case, a measurable asymmetry in the autocorrelation function will still be expected.\n\nWe thank Avishay Gal-Yam, Eran Ofek, Sterl Phinney, and\nOhad Shemmer for inspiring discussions. M.
