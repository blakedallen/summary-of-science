FAYAD, AND ENRIQUE PUJALS\nAbstract. We show that a stably ergodic diffeomorphism can be C 1 approximated by a diffeomorphism having stably non-zero Lyapunov exponents.\nUne remarque sur les diff\u00e9omorphismes conservatifs\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9. On montre qu'un diff\u00e9omorphisme stablement ergodique peut \u00eatre C 1\napproch\u00e9 par un diff\u00e9omorphisme ayant des exposants de Lyapunov stablement\nnon-nuls.\n\nTwo central notions in Dynamical Systems are ergodicity and hyperbolicity. In\nmany works showing that certain systems are ergodic, some kind of hyperbolicity\n(e.g. uniform, non-uniform or partial) is a main ingredient in the proof. In this\nnote the converse direction is investigated.\nLet M be a compact manifold of dimension d \u2265 2, and let \u03bc be a volume\n1+\u03b1\nmeasure in M . Take \u03b1 > 0 and let Diff 1+\u03b1\n\u03bc (M ) be the set of \u03bc-preserving C\n1+\u03b1\ndiffeomorphisms, endowed with the C 1 topology. Let SE \u2282 Diff \u03bc (M ) be the\nset of stably ergodic diffeomorphisms (i.e., the set of diffeomorphisms such that\nevery sufficiently C 1 -close C 1+\u03b1 conservative diffeomorphism is ergodic).\nOur result answers positively a question of [BuDP]:\nTheorem 1. There is an open and dense set R \u2282 SE such that if f \u2208 R then\nf is non-uniformly hyperbolic, that is, all Lyapunov exponents of f are non-zero.\nMoreover, every f \u2208 R admits a dominated splitting T M = E + \u2295 E \u2212 , where E +\n(resp. E \u2212 ) coincides a.e. with the sum of the Oseledets spaces corresponding to\npositive (resp. negative) Lyapunov exponents.\nRemark 1. The set SE contains all Anosov diffeomorphisms, and many partially\nhyperbolic ones \u2013 see e.g. [GPS]. It is not true that every stably ergodic diffeomorphism can be approximated by a partially hyperbolic system, see [T, BnV].\nRemark 2. Let SE \u2032 be the set of diffeomorphisms f \u2208 SE such that every power\nf k , k \u2265 2, is ergodic. Then every f in SE \u2032 \u2229 R is Bernoulli. This follows from\ntheorem 1 and Pesin theory (see theorem 5.10 in [L]).\nThe proof of theorem 1 has three steps:\n1. A stably ergodic (or stably transitive) diffeomorphism f must have a dominated splitting. This is true because if it doesn't, [BDP] permits us to\nperturb f and create a periodic point whose derivative is the identity.\nJ.B. was supported by CNPq-Profix during the preparation of this work. J.B. thanks the\nhospitality of the LAGA \u2013 Universit\u00e9 de Paris 13.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nJ. BOCHI, B. R. FAYAD, E. PUJALS\n\nThen, using the Pasting Lemma from [AM] (for which C 1+\u03b1 regularity is\nan essential hypothesis), one breaks transitivity.\n2. A result of [BB] gives a perturbation of f such that the sum of the Lyapunov exponents \"inside\" each of the bundles of the (finest) dominated\nsplitting is non-zero.\n3. Using a result of [BV], we find another perturbation such that the Lyapunov exponents in each of the bundles become almost equal. (If we\nattempted to make the exponents exactly equal, we couldn't guarantee\nthat the perturbation is C 1+\u03b1 .) Since the sum of the exponents in each\nbundle varies continuously, we conclude there are no zero exponents.\nRemark 3. The perturbation techniques of [BB] and [BV] in fact don't assume ergodicity, but are only able to control the integrated Lyapunov exponents. That's\nwhy we have to assume stable ergodicity (in place of stable transitivity) in theorem 1.\nRemark 4. Theorem 1 is stated in C 1 topology because in higher topologies the\ntechnology from [BDP], [BB], and [BV] is not available. The C 1+\u03b1 diffeomorphisms come from [AM]. To get our result in C 1 topology (which perhaps would\nbe more natural) one has to solve the following problem: any diffeomorphism\nhaving a periodic point tangent to the identity may be C 1 -approximated by a\nnon-transitive diffeomorphism.\nRemark 5. Some ideas of the present proof were already present in [DP].\nLet us recall briefly the definition and some properties of dominated splittings,\nsee [BDP] for details. Let f \u2208 Diff 1\u03bc (M ).\nA Df -invariant splitting T M = E 1 \u2295 * * *\u2295 E k , with k \u2265 2, is called a dominated\nsplitting (over M ) if there are constants c, \u03c4 > 0 such that\n(1)\n\nkDf n (x) * vj k\n< ce\u2212\u03c4 n\nkDf n (x) * vi k\n\nfor all x \u2208 M , all n \u2265 1, and all unit vectors vi \u2208 E i (x) and vj \u2208 E j (x), provided\ni < j. (One can also define in the same way a dominated splitting over an f invariant set.)\nA dominated splitting is always continuous, that is, the spaces Ei (x) depend\ncontinuously on x. Also, a dominated splitting persists under C 1 -perturbations\nof the map. More precisely, if g is sufficiently close to f , then g has a dominated\nsplitting Eg1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Egk , called the continuation, with dim Egi = dim E i and which\ncoincides with the given one when g = f . Moreover, Egi (x) depends continuously\non g (and x).\nA dominated splitting E 1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 E k is called the finest dominated splitting\nif there is no dominated splitting defined over all M with more than k bundles.\nIf some dominated splitting exists, then the finest dominated splitting exists, is\nunique, and refines every dominated splitting.\nThe continuation of the finest dominated splitting is not necessarily the finest\ndominated splitting of the perturbed diffeomorphism. We call a dominated splitting for f \u2208 Diff 1+\u03b1\n\u03bc (M ) stably finest if it has a continuation which is the finest\n\n\fA REMARK ON CONSERVATIVE DIFFEOMORPHISMS\n\n3\n\ndominated splitting of every sufficiently C 1 -close diffeomorphism of class C 1+\u03b1 .\nIt is easy to see that diffeomorphisms with stably finest dominated splittings are\n(open and) dense among C 1+\u03b1 diffeomorphisms with a dominated splitting.\nLet \u03bb1 (f, x) \u2265 * * * \u2265 \u03bbd (f, x) be the Lyapunov exponents of f (counted with\nmultiplicity), defined for almost all x. (See e.g. [A] for definition and basic properties of Lyapunov exponents.) We write also\nZ\n\u03bbi (f, x) d\u03bc(x).\n(2)\n\u03bbi (f ) =\nM\n\nAssume f has a dominated splitting E 1 \u2295* * * \u2295E k . Then the Oseledets splitting\nis a measurable refinement of it. For simplicity of writing, we will say the exponent\n\u03bbp belongs to the bundle E i if d1 +* * *+di\u22121 < p \u2264 d1 +* * *+di , where di = dim E i .\nBy (1), there is an uniform gap between Lyapunov exponents that belong to\ndifferent bundles.\nWe now give the proof of theorem 1 in detail. Let R be the set of f \u2208 SE\nsuch that f has a dominated splitting E + \u2295 E \u2212 with \u03bbp (f ) > 0 > \u03bbp+1 (f ), where\np = dim E + . First we see that R is an open set. Indeed, given f \u2208 R, there is an\nopen set U \u220b f where the dominated splitting has a continuation, say Eg+ \u2295 Eg\u2212\nfor g \u2208 U . As \u03bbp+1 is the top exponent in E \u2212 , we can write\nZ\n1\nlog kDgn (x)|Eg\u2212 (x) k d\u03bc(x).\n(3)\n\u03bbp+1 (g) = inf\nn\u2208N n M\nTherefore g \u2208 U 7\u2192 \u03bbp+1 (g) is an upper semicontinuous function. Accordingly,\n\u03bbp+1 (g) < 0 for all g sufficiently close to f . And analogously for \u03bbp , showing that\nR is open.\nNext we show that R is dense in SE. Take f \u2208 Diff 1+\u03b1\n\u03bc (M ) a stably ergodic\ndiffeomorphism. As mentioned, this implies that f has a dominated splitting,\nsee [AM]. As remarked above, we can assume, after a perturbation of f if necessary, that f has a stably finest dominated splitting.\nFor all g sufficiently close to f , we denote by Eg1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Egk the finest dominated\nsplitting of g. Let us indicate by Ji (g) the sum of all Lyapunov exponents \u03bbp (g)\nthat belong to Egi . Then we can also write\nZ\nlog det Dg|Egi d\u03bc.\n(4)\nJi (g) =\nM\n\nIn particular, Ji (*) is a continuous function in the neighborhood of f .\nBy the theorem from [BB], up to C 1 -perturbing f , we may assume Ji (f ) 6= 0\nfor all i. (It is important to notice that the perturbed map can be taken of class\nC 1+\u03b1 since so is the original f .)\nIn the last step we need the following proposition:\nProposition 1. Let f \u2208 SE. Assume that f has a stably finest dominated splitting\nEf1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Efk . Then for all \u03b5 > 0 there exists a perturbation g \u2208 Diff 1+\u03b1\n\u03bc (M ) of\nf such that if the Lyapunov exponents \u03bbp (g), \u03bbq (g) belong to the same bundle Egi ,\nthen |\u03bbp (g) \u2212 \u03bbq (g)| < \u03b5.\n\n\f4\n\nJ. BOCHI, B. R. FAYAD, E. PUJALS\n\nApplying the proposition, we find g close to f such that all \u03bbp (g) in Egi are close\nto Ji (g)/ dim E i and therefore are non-zero. This finishes the proof of theorem 1,\nmodulo giving the:\nProof of proposition 1. For f \u2208 Diff 1+\u03b1\n\u03bc (M ) and 1 \u2264 p \u2264 d, let us write \u039bp (f ) =\n\u03bb1 (f ) + * * * + \u03bbp (f ). Then \u039bp (*) is an upper semicontinuous function (see [A] or\n[BV]). Since Diff 1+\u03b1\n\u03bc (M ) is not a complete metric space, we can't deduce that the\nset of continuity points of \u039bp (*) is dense. Nevertheless, for every \u03b5 > 0, the set\nD\u03b5,p = {f \u2208 Diff 1+\u03b1\n\u03bc (M ); \u2203 U \u220b f open s.t. |\u039bp (g1 ) \u2212 \u039bp (g2 )| < \u03b5 \u2200g1 , g2 \u2208 U }\nis (open and) dense in Diff 1+\u03b1\n\u03bc (M ). (This is an easy exercise using \u039bp \u2265 0.) In\nTd\nparticular, D\u03b5 = p=1 D\u03b5,p is dense.\nNow let f \u2208 SE have a stably finest dominated spitting into k bundles. Fix\n\u03b5 > 0 and take g \u2208 D\u03b5 very C 1 -close to f . We claim that g has the desired\nproperties: for any i = 1, . . . , k, if \u03bbp , \u03bbq belong to Egi then \u03bbp , \u03bbq are close.\nClearly, it suffices to consider the case q = p + 1.\nConsider the set Dp (g) of points x \u2208 M such that there exists a dominated\nsplitting To(g,x) M = F \u2295 G over the closure of the g-orbit of x, with dim F = p.\nNotice there is no dominated splitting T M = F \u2295 G (over M ) with dim F = p,\nbecause \u03bbp and \u03bbp+1 belong to the same bundle of the finest dominated splitting\nof g. Thus no x \u2208 Dp (g) can have a dense orbit. In particular, Dp (g) has zero\nmeasure. By proposition 4.17 from [BV], there exists a C 1 -perturbation h of g\nsuch that\nZ\n\u03bbp (g, x) \u2212 \u03bbp+1 (g, x)\n\u039bp (h) < \u039bp (g) \u2212\nd\u03bc(x) + \u03b5\n2\nM \\Dp (g)\n= \u039bp (g) \u2212\n\n\u03bbp (g) \u2212 \u03bbp+1 (g)\n+ \u03b5.\n2\n\n(In the notation of [BV], \u0393p (g, \u221e) = M \\ Dp (g).) Because g is C 1+\u03b1 , the map h\ngiven by the proof of proposition 4.17 in [BV] is C 1+\u03b1 as well. Since g \u2208 D\u03b5,p and h\nis close to g, we have |\u039bp (h)\u2212\u039bp (g)| < \u03b5 and accordingly \u03bbp (g)\u2212\u03bbp+1 (g) < 4\u03b5. \u0003\nWe close this note with some questions about what can be said in the absence\nof stable ergodicity. The following question (similar to one in [SW]) is likely to\nhave a positive answer:\nProblem 1. Is it true that for the generic f \u2208 Diff 1\u03bc (M ), either all Lyapunov\nexponents are zero at almost every point, or f is non-uniformly hyperbolic (i.e.,\nall Lyapunov exponents are non-zero almost everywhere)?\nNotice this is true if dim M = 2, by [B] (later extended in [BV]). Using the main\nresult of the papers [BV] and [BB], it is not difficult to show that the dichotomy\nof problem 1 holds true modulo an eventual positive answer to the following well\nknown conjecture of A. Katok:\nProblem 2. Is it true that the generic map f \u2208 Diff 1\u03bc (M ) is ergodic?\n\n\fA REMARK ON CONSERVATIVE DIFFEOMORPHISMS\n\n5\n\nReferences\n[AM]\n\nA. Arbieto and C. Matheus.
