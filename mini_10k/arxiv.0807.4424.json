First, a mathematically consistent definition avoiding the problem found in Refs. [1, 2] was formulated, and a succinct\nmethod to check the symmetry properties of dimensional reduction was developed [3], leading to the verification of supersymmetry in important cases at the\ntwo-loop level [4]. Second, explicit calculations demonstrated how dimensional\nreduction can be applied to multiloop calculations and how renormalization has\nto be carried out in a non-supersymmetric context [5]. This provides the basis of\ntransition rules between various definitions of parameters such as \u03b1s or mb and\nis useful to derive the GUT-scale values of these parameters from the experimental values [6]. Third, an obstacle in the application of dimensional reduction to\nhadronic processes was removed [7] by the resolution of the factorization problem\nof dimensional reduction found in Refs. [8\u201310].\nThe purpose of the present article is to further elaborate on the application of\ndimensional reduction to hadronic processes. In Ref. [7] we restricted ourselves\nto the case considered in Ref. [8], the real corrections to the process gg \u2192 tt\u0304, and\nshowed that, despite first appearances, in the collinear limit these real corrections\nfactorize into products of splitting functions and leading-order cross sections.\nHere we will consider real and virtual NLO QCD corrections to arbitrary\nhadronic 2 \u2192 (n \u2212 2) processes with massless or massive partons. We will discuss the infrared singularity structure and the associated regularization-scheme\ndependence of all these corrections, provide transition rules between the schemes\nand show that all singularities factorize. In this way we show that the framework\nof dimensional reduction is completely consistent with factorization, and we show\nhow this scheme can be used to compute hadronic processes in practice.\nOne of the main points of this article is the distinction of two different versions\nof dimensional reduction that have been used in the literature. One of the reasons\nwhy the factorization problem of Refs. [8\u201310] has remained unsolved for so long is\nthat these two versions have mainly been applied by two different communities.\nThe version used in Refs. [8\u201310] is the same as the one defined in Refs. [3, 11, 12]\nand is the one mainly used in the context of supersymmetry. The version used\nin Refs. [13\u201315], which was denoted by dr and is actually equivalent to the\nfour-dimensional helicity (fdh) scheme [16] at one-loop, is mainly used in the\ncontext of QCD. For the latter version, the infrared singularity structure and\ntransition rules have already been derived [13\u201315]. We denote these two versions\nby dred and fdh. They differ in their treatment of external particles, in a way\nanalogous to the difference of the \"conventional\" and \" 't Hooft Veltman\" versions\nof dimensional regularization, cdr and hv.\nIn the main part of the present article we will provide results and transition\nrules for all these four regularization schemes, keeping in mind that the results\nfor the fdh, cdr and hv schemes can already be found in Refs. [13\u201315], while\n1\n\n\fthe results for dred are new. The results for the infrared singularity structure\nin cdr, hv, fdh and in dred are developed in Section 2 and 3, respectively.\nThe practical application of dred and transition rules are discussed in Section 4.\nAppendix A provides explicit results for all relevant splitting functions, and in\nAppendix B we provide three explicit examples of NLO computations in dred.\n\n1.1\n\nElements and scheme dependences of hadronic cross\nsections\n\nWe consider n-parton processes with up to two hadrons in the initial state at nextto-leading (NLO) order in QCD. The partons can be either massless quarks q or\ngluons g or massive partons such as heavy quarks Q, gluinos, or squarks. In our\nequations we will restrict ourselves to the most interesting case of two initial-state\npartons as the simpler cases can be obtained by straightforward modifications.\nThe cross sections of such processes can be written as\nZ\nZ 1\n\u0001 X 1\nd\u03c3 H1 (K1 )H2 (K2 ) \u2192 a3 . . . an =\ndx1 fa1 /H1 (x1 )\ndx2 fa2 /H2 (x2 )\na1 ,a2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u0001\n\u00d7 d\u03c3\u0302 a1 (x1 K1 )a2 (x2 K2 ); a3 . . . an ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere H1,2 are the initial-state hadrons, K1,2 their momenta and ai (i = 3 . . . n)\nthe final-state partons. The sums run over all possible flavours of the initial-state\npartons a1,2 of the hard partonic cross section d\u03c3\u0302, and fai /Hi (x) denote the appropriate parton distribution functions (PDF). In the computation of hadronic cross\nsections, three scheme choices have to be made: the choice of the renormalization\nscheme, the factorization scheme, and the regularization scheme.\nThe functional dependence of the hard cross section d\u03c3\u0302 on input parameters\nlike \u03b1s , particle masses, etc, depends on the renormalization and the factorization\nschemes.\nThe choice of the renormalization scheme is equivalent to a precise definition\nof the input parameters entering the computation, in particular of \u03b1s , particle\nmasses and other coupling constants. Once it has been fixed and renormalization has been carried out accordingly, all off-shell Green functions are finite and\nunambiguously defined. Changing the renormalization scheme changes both the\nfunctional form of d\u03c3\u0302 and the numerical values of the input parameters, such\nthat d\u03c3\u0302 is renormalization-scheme independent up to terms which are formally\nof higher order than NLO. Common renormalization schemes are the MS-scheme\nfor \u03b1s , the DR-scheme for supersymmetric parameters, or the on-shell scheme for\nmasses.1 In the following we are not concerned with the renormalization-scheme\ndependence and assume that some renormalization scheme has been fixed.\n1\n\nWe stress that, although the MS- and DR-schemes have originally been defined with reference to specific regularization schemes, they can be realized in the context of any regularization\nscheme.\n\n2\n\n\fThe choice of the factorization scheme is equivalent to a precise definition of\nthe parton distribution functions. Both the functional form of the hard cross\nsection and the numerical values of the parton distribution functions depend\non this choice, but this dependence cancels in the full hadronic cross section\nup to terms which are formally of higher order than NLO. The major part of\nthe following considerations is independent of the factorization scheme, and we\nsimply assume that some factorization scheme has been fixed. At the end we\nwill specialize to the important case of the MS-factorization scheme. In that\ncase, the parton distribution functions fai /Hi can be taken for instance from the\nwell-known MRST or CTEQ sets [17, 18].\nOur main focus is the influence of the regularization scheme (rs). After removing the regularization, all quantities appearing in Eq. (1) are rs independent,\nbut the hard partonic cross section is a sum of rs dependent parts. It is commonly\nwritten as\nBorn\nreal\nvirt\ncoll\n,\n+ d\u03c3RS\n+ d\u03c3RS\n+ d\u03c3RS\nd\u03c3\u0302 = d\u03c3RS\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the rs dependence is explicitly indicated. The lowest-order, or Born cross\nsection d\u03c3 Born is finite, and in the limit where the regularization is removed its\nrs dependence vanishes. The three NLO contributions are the real and virtual\ncorrections d\u03c3 real , d\u03c3 virt and the collinear counterterm d\u03c3 coll , which subtracts\ninitial-state collinear singularities. All NLO contributions involve collinear and/or\nsoft singularities and depend on the rs in their finite and their divergent parts.\nThere are no ultraviolet singularities and associated rs dependences in d\u03c3 virt ,\nbecause these are eliminated by renormalization and by fixing the renormalization\nscheme.\n\n1.2\n\nVariants of dimensional regularization and dimensional reduction\n\nIn all dimensional schemes space-time is continued from 4 to D dimensions, where\nD = 4 \u2212 2\u01eb is an arbitrary complex number. In this way momentum integrals\nbecome well-defined and ultraviolet and infrared singularities appear as 1/\u01ebk poles as \u01eb \u2192 0. Gluon fields are treated differently in dimensional regularization\nand dimensional reduction. In the former, gluons are treated as D-dimensional\nas well; in the latter, gluons are treated as 4-dimensional.\nBoth choices have certain advantages. The purely D-dimensional treatment\nof all objects leads to simpler expressions, but it breaks supersymmetry owing to\nthe different number of degrees of freedom of the gluon and the gluino. The 4dimensional treatment of the gluon is better compatible with supersymmetry and\nit is more amenable to helicity methods, which are commonly used to simplify\nQCD higher-order computations.\nIn order to formulate the two schemes one needs to distinguish three spaces:\n3\n\n\f\u2022 the original 4-dimensional space (4S).\n\u2022 the formally D-dimensional space for momenta and momentum integrals. This space is actually an infinite-dimensional vector space with certain D-dimensional properties [19, 20], and is sometimes called \"quasi-Ddimensional space\" (QDS). The space 4S is therefore a subspace of QDS.\n\u2022 the formally 4-dimensional space for e.g. gluons in dimensional reduction.\nThis space has to be a superspace of QDS in order for the dimensionally\nreduced theory to be gauge invariant. Hence it cannot be identified with\nthe original 4S - it can only be constructed as a \"quasi-4-dimensional\nspace\" (Q4S) [3, 21] with certain 4-dimensional properties. In practice the\ndistinction between Q4S and 4S often does not matter, but it is important in\nthe definition of the different versions of dimensional reduction, see below,\nand to avoid the inconsistency uncovered in Ref. [2].\nThese three spaces are characterized by their metric tensors, which we denote by\ng \u03bc\u03bd (for Q4S), \u011d \u03bc\u03bd (for QDS), and \u1e21 \u03bc\u03bd (for 4S). The dimensionalities of the spaces\nare expressed by the following equations:\ng \u03bc\u03bd g\u03bc\u03bd = 4,\n\n\u011d \u03bc\u03bd \u011d\u03bc\u03bd = D = 4 \u2212 2\u01eb,\n\n\u1e21 \u03bc\u03bd \u1e21\u03bc\u03bd = 4.\n\n(3)\n\nThe following projection relations express that 4S is a subspace of QDS and QDS\nis a subspace of Q4S:\ng \u03bc\u03bd \u011d\u03bd \u03c1 = \u011d \u03bc\u03c1 ,\n\ng \u03bc\u03bd \u1e21\u03bd \u03c1 = \u1e21 \u03bc\u03c1 ,\n\n\u011d \u03bc\u03bd \u1e21\u03bd \u03c1 = \u1e21 \u03bc\u03c1 .\n\n(4)\n\nIt is useful to introduce the orthogonal complement to QDS. This is a 4\u2212D = 2\u01ebdimensional space with metric tensor g\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd , which satisfies\ng \u03bc\u03bd = \u011d \u03bc\u03bd + g\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd ,\ng\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd = 4 \u2212 D = 2\u01eb,\ng \u03bc\u03bd g\u0303\u03bd \u03c1 = g\u0303 \u03bc\u03c1 ,\n\n\u011d \u03bc\u03bd g\u0303\u03bd \u03c1 = 0,\n\n\u1e21 \u03bc\u03bd g\u0303\u03bd \u03c1 = 0.\n\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\n\nWithin this framework it is now possible to precisely state the calculational\nrules of dimensional regularization and dimensional reduction. Since momenta are\nalways treated in D dimensions, it only needs to be specified how gluons (or other\nvector fields) are treated. More precisely, it needs to be specified which metric\ntensors are used in gluon propagator numerators and in gluon polarization sums.\nParticularly important for the understanding of factorization is the treatment\nof gluon polarization sums in squared matrix elements. Without regularization,\nsuch polarization sums can be written as\nX\npols\n\n\u01eb\u03bc \u01eb\u03bd \u2217 = \u2212\u1e21 \u03bc\u03bd +\n\nn\u03bc k \u03bd + k \u03bc n\u03bd\nn2 k \u03bc k \u03bd\n\u2212\n,\n(nk)\n(nk)2\n4\n\n(8)\n\n\fcdr\ninternal gluon \u011d \u03bc\u03bd\nexternal gluon \u011d \u03bc\u03bd\n\nhv\n\u011d \u03bc\u03bd\n\u1e21 \u03bc\u03bd\n\nfdh\ng \u03bc\u03bd\n\u1e21 \u03bc\u03bd\n\ndred\ng \u03bc\u03bd\ng \u03bc\u03bd\n\nTable 1: Treatment of internal and external gluons in the four different rs, i.e.\nprescription for which metric tensor is to be used in propagator numerators and\npolarization sums. For the definition of \"internal\" and \"external\" see text.\n\nwhere k is the gluon momentum and n is a gauge vector such that nk 6= 0. With\nregularization, the metric tensor in this polarization is replaced by either g \u03bc\u03bd ,\n\u011d \u03bc\u03bd , g\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd , or \u1e21 \u03bc\u03bd .\nIt is not strictly necessary to regularize all gluons. Only gluons that appear\ninside a divergent loop or phase space integral (\"internal\") need to be regularized;\nfor all other gluons (\"external\") regularization is optional. The precise definitions\nof \"internal/external\" in this context are as follows: \"Internal gluons\" are defined\nas either virtual gluons that are part of a one-particle irreducible loop diagram or,\nfor real correction diagrams, gluons in the initial or final state that are collinear\nor soft. \"External gluons\" are defined as all other gluons.\nNow, since external gluons do not have to be treated in the same way as internal ones, it is in fact possible to distinguish two variants of each regularization.\nThe two variants of dimensional regularization are:\n\u2022 cdr (\"conventional dimensional regularization\"): Here internal and external gluons (and other vector fields) are all treated as D-dimensional.\n\u2022 hv (\" 't Hooft Veltman scheme\"): Internal gluons are treated as Ddimensional but external ones are treated as strictly 4-dimensional.\nNote that the above definition of internal gluons in phase space integrals is necessary for unitarity but leads to complications in the treatment of phase space\nintegrals in schemes where internal and external gluons are treated differently.\nThe two analogous variants of dimensional reduction are:\n\u2022 dred (\"original/old dimensional reduction\"): Internal and external gluons\nare all treated as quasi-4-dimensional.\n\u2022 fdh (\"four-dimensional helicity scheme\"): Internal gluons are treated as\nquasi-4-dimensional but external ones are treated as strictly 4-dimensional.\nTable 1 illustrates these four schemes.\nNote that the version of dimensional reduction denoted by dr e.g. in Refs. [13,\n15] is equivalent to fdh at the one-loop level (see e.g. Refs. [13,22]).2 The infrared\n2\n\nIn Ref. [23] a two-loop definition of the fdh scheme has been given. In what follows we\nwill only use the one-loop definition and the one-loop equivalence of fdh and dr.\n\n5\n\n\fproperties of the three schemes cdr, hv, dr (or equivalently fdh) have been\nstudied and compared in Ref. [15] and found to be consistent with factorization.\nAn apparent inconsistency between dimensional reduction and factorization\nhas been identified in Refs. [8, 10], but in these references the version dred has\nbeen used. In Ref. [7] it was found that factorization holds as expected in dred\nif external quasi-4-dimensional gluons are decomposed into D dimensional gauge\nfields and (4 \u2212 D) dimensional \"\u01eb-scalars\", which are treated as separate partons.\nTechnically, this decomposition amounts to replacing\nMDRED (. . . g . . .) = MDRED (. . . \u011d . . .) + MDRED (. . . g\u0303 . . .)\nX\n=\nMDRED (. . . \u011f . . .),\n\n(9)\n\n\u011f\u2208{\u011d,g\u0303}\n\nfor squared matrix elements, where the different gluon types g, \u011d, g\u0303 are denoted\nby the same symbols as the associated metric tensors. The algebraic expressions\nfor the partonic processes involving g, \u011d, or g\u0303 are defined by the values of the\ncorresponding gluon polarization sums.

(9) follows trivially from Eq. (5).\nThe decomposition of gluons into their D-dimensional and \u01eb-scalar part in\ndred is also relevant for the renormalization of UV divergences. In order to make\nGreen functions with external \u01eb-scalars finite, the renormalization constants for\n\u01eb-scalar couplings in general have to be different from the corresponding gluon\ncouplings. For example, in pure QCD, the couplings \u03b1s and \u03b1e for the quark\u2013\nantiquark\u2013gluon and the quark\u2013antiquark\u2013\u01eb-scalar vertices receive different counterterms \u03b4\u03b1s 6= \u03b4\u03b1e even if \u03b1s = \u03b1e at tree level [5, 24].\n\n1.3\n\nSplittings in the four schemes\n\nAn essential part of the rs dependence of NLO contributions is related to the\nrs dependence of the splittings i \u2192 jk of one parton i into two collinear partons\nj, k. The rs dependence of real corrections is related to the splitting functions\nRS\nPi\u2192jk\n; the rs dependence of virtual corrections is related to constants \u03b3RS (i) [13],\nRS\nwhich in turn can be derived from the Pi\u2192jk\nvia unitarity [15].

The full results can be found in Appendix A. Figure 1 shows the most\ninteresting case of a gluon splitting into two collinear gluons. According to the\ndefinition given above, the two collinear gluons j and k are treated as \"internal\",\nand the virtual gluon i as \"external\". The appropriate treatment of the gluons\nin the four rs can be read off from Table 1 and is displayed in the figure. Two\nsimple observations allow an easy comparison of the four cases.\nFirst, the projection of a D-dimensional onto a strictly 4-dimensional parent\ngluon does not change the structure of the result of the splitting functions. And\nsecond, the result in dred should be decomposed according to Eq. (9) into four\nsplittings \u011d \u2192 \u011d\u011d, \u011d \u2192 g\u0303g\u0303, g\u0303 \u2192 \u011dg\u0303, g\u0303 \u2192 g\u0303\u011d.3 Then the result in cdr is identical\nto the dred result for \u011d \u2192 \u011d\u011d, and all scheme differences can be explained in the\nfollowing way:\n\u2022 The splitting g \u2192 gg is identical in the cdr and hv schemes. Formally,\nthis is expressed in the equality\nCDR\nHV\nDRED\nPg<\u2217 \u2192gg\n(z) = Pg<\u2217 \u2192gg\n(z) = P\u011d<\u2217 \u2192\u011d\u011d\n(z)\n\n(11)\n\nfor the splitting functions defined for z < 1.\n\u2022 In the fdh scheme the outgoing gluons are treated as quasi-4-dimensional.\nThe resulting additional term can be interpreted as being due to the splitting \u011d \u2192 g\u0303g\u0303 as already discussed in Ref. [15]. Hence,\nFDH\nDRED\nDRED\nPg<\u2217 \u2192gg\n(z) = P\u011d<\u2217 \u2192\u011d\u011d\n(z) + P\u011d<\u2217 \u2192g\u0303g\u0303\n(z).\n\n(12)\n\n\u2022 In the dred scheme the parent gluon is also treated as quasi-4-dimensional,\nand therefore the two additional splittings g\u0303 \u2192 \u011dg\u0303 and g\u0303 \u2192 g\u0303\u011d are possible.\nIn the spirit of our discussion around Eq. (9) we do not combine the dred\nsplitting functions into a single one.\n3\n\nSplittings involving an odd number of g\u0303 vanish.\n\n7\n\n\fThe splitting functions involving quarks are related in a similar way. Via unitarity, the rs dependence of the constants \u03b3(i) follows from the splitting functions [15] and can thus be explained in an analogous way:\n\u2022 The \u03b3(i) in cdr and hv are the same,\n\u03b3CDR (i) = \u03b3HV (i) for i \u2208 {g, q}.\n\n(13)\n\n\u2022 The additional terms in the fdh scheme are due to the splittings \u011d \u2192 g\u0303g\u0303\nand q \u2192 qg\u0303:\nZ 1\n< DRED\n\u03b3FDH (g) = \u03b3HV (g) \u2212\ndz zP\u011d\u2192g\u0303g\u0303\n(z),\n(14)\n0\nZ 1\n\u0002 < DRED\n\u0003\n< DRED\n\u03b3FDH (q) = \u03b3HV (q) \u2212\ndz z Pq\u2192qg\u0303\n(z) + Pq\u2192g\u0303q\n(z) .\n(15)\n0\n\n\u2022 In dred one has to distinguish \u03b3 constants for \u011d, g\u0303, and q. The ones\ncorresponding to \u011d and q are the same as the ones in the fdh scheme; the\none for g\u0303 is related to the additional splittings g\u0303 \u2192 \u011dg\u0303 and g\u0303 \u2192 g\u0303\u011d:\n\u03b3DRED (\u011d) = \u03b3FDH (g),\n\u03b3DRED (q) = \u03b3FDH (q),\nZ 1\n(1 \u2212 z) \u0002 < DRED\nP\n(z)\n\u03b3DRED (g\u0303) = \u2212\ndz z\n(1 \u2212 z)+ g\u0303\u2192g\u0303\u011d\n0\n\u0003\n< DRED\n< DRED\n+Pg\u0303\u2192\u011dg\u0303\n(z) + 2NF Pg\u0303\u2192q\nq\u0304 (z)\n\n(16)\n(17)\n\n(18)\n\nThese relations form the basis for understanding the rs dependence of NLO contributions and in particular the difference between dred and the other schemes.\nIn the subsequent sections we will see that additional rs dependences arise from\nthe crossing of the splitting functions to initial-state parton splitting and from\nthe rs dependence of the LO matrix element.\n\n2\n\nCDR, HV, FDH\n\nOur starting point is the decomposition, Eq. (2), of the hard partonic cross section, and we are mainly interested in the rs dependence of the separate terms\ncontributing to d\u03c3\u0302. In this section we will restrict ourselves to the well-known\ncases of cdr, hv and fdh. The rs dependence of quantities will be indicated\nby a subscript RS\u2217, the star reminding us that we consider cdr, hv and fdh, but\nnot (yet) dred.\n\n8\n\n\f2.1\n\nBorn term\n\nWe consider the partonic process\na1 (p1 ) a2 (p2 ) \u2192 a3 (p3 ) . . . an (pn ) ,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere ai and pi denote the flavour and the momentum of parton i respectively.\nThe l-loop correction to the rs dependent squared matrix element for the pro(l)\ncess given in Eq. (19) is denoted by MRS\u2217 (a1 (p1 ), a2 (p2 ); a3 (p3 ) . . . an (pn )) or by\n(l)\nMRS\u2217 (a1 . . . an ) for short. For the cross section we need the averaged squared\nmatrix elements\n(l)\n\nhMRS\u2217 (a1 , a2 ; . . . an )i =\n\n1\n1\n(l)\nMRS\u2217 (a1 , a2 ; . . . an ),\n2 s12 \u03c9RS\u2217 (a1 ) \u03c9RS\u2217 (a2 )\n\n(20)\n\nwhere \u03c9RS\u2217 (ai ) denotes the rs dependent number of degrees of freedom of a parton\nwith flavour ai and s12 \u2261 2 (p1 * p2 ) in the case of massless incoming partons.\nThe Born cross section is obtained by integrating the squared and\naveraged tree-level matrix element over the (n \u2212 2) parton phase space\nd\u03a6n\u22122 (p1 , p2 ; p3 . . . pn ) multiplied by a measurement function for an infrared-safe\nquantity and a symmetry factor. The latter two are always implicitly understood\nin our notation and we simply write\nZ\n(0)\n(0)\nd\u03c3RS\u2217 (a1 . . . an ) = d\u03a6n\u22122 (p1 . . . pn ) hMRS\u2217 (a1 . . . an )i.\n(21)\n(0)\n\nThe rs dependence in Eq. (21) is due to O(\u01eb) terms in MRS\u2217 . Since we consider\nan infrared-finite quantity, the phase-space integration does not introduce any\npoles. Therefore, we can take the limit \u01eb \u2192 0 and\nh\ni\n(0)\nd\u03c3 Born(a1 . . . an ) \u2261 d\u03c3RS\u2217 (a1 . . . an )\n(22)\nD\u21924\n\nis rs independent, as indicated by the absence of the subscript\n\n2.2\n\n\u2217.\n\nRS\n\nVirtual corrections\n(1)\n\nFor the virtual corrections we need MRS\u2217 , the interference terms of the one-loop\namplitude and the tree-level amplitude. The structure of the singular terms of\n(1)\nMRS\u2217 is well known [14,25]. For the fully renormalized matrix element, it is given\nby\n!\n\"\n1X\n\u03b1s\n(0)\n(1)\n\u03b3RS\u2217 (ai )\n(23)\nc\u0393 MRS\u2217 (a1 . . . an ) \u2212\nMRS\u2217 (a1 . . . an ) =\n2\u03c0\n\u01eb i\n#\nX\n(1)\nij\n+\nV(i, j) MRS\u2217 (a1 . . . an ) + MNS (a1 . . . an ) ,\ni,j\n\n9\n\n\fwhere the sums i and j are over all initial or final state partons and we introduced\n\u0012 \u03b3E \u0013\u2212\u01eb \u0012\n\u0013\n2\n\u01eb2 \u03c0 2\ne\n3\n\u01eb \u0393(1 + \u01eb)\u0393 (1 \u2212 \u01eb)\n1\u2212\n=\n+ O(\u01eb ) .\n(24)\nc\u0393 \u2261 (4\u03c0)\n\u0393(1 \u2212 2\u01eb)\n4\u03c0\n12\n(0)\n\nThe soft and collinear poles are contained in the terms proportional to MRS\u2217 and\nMij\nRS\u2217 . The latter are the colour-linked Born squared matrix elements introduced\nin Ref. [26] and correspond to the square of the colour-correlated tree amplitudes\nwith a Ti * Tj insertion, used in Ref. [27]. If particles i and j are massless, we\nhave\n\u0013\u2212\u01eb\n\u0012\n1\nsij\nV(i, j) = \u2212 2 Re \u2212 2\n(25)\n2\u01eb\n\u03bc\nand Eq. (23) reduces to the well-known expression for the singularities of oneloop QCD amplitudes [25]. If one or both of the particles i, j are massive, these\nexpressions have to be generalized [14], but the structure of the singularities\nremains as in Eq. (23).\nThe rs dependence of Eq. (23) is contained in the constants \u03b3RS\u2217 (ai )/\u01eb, as\n(0)\n(1)\nwell as in MRS\u2217 and Mij\nRS\u2217 . The remaining term, MNS (a1 . . . an ), is in general\nvery complicated, but is finite and, after taking the limit D \u2192 4, rs independent.\nThe essential, non-trivial part of the rs dependence is due to the \u03b3RS\u2217 (ai )/\u01eb\nterms. These are closely related to collinear singularities due to self-energy insertions on external legs and depend on the flavour ai of leg i. The rs dependence\nof \u03b3RS\u2217 has been given in Ref. [13]. Via unitarity it is related to parton splittings\nai \u2192anything [15], as summarized in Section 1.3.\nIn the present paper we determine \u03b3RS\u2217 by insisting that the sum rules hold in\nall rs to all orders in \u01eb. This is a slightly different approach compared to Ref. [13]\n(1)\nand simply amounts to a shift of finite terms between MNS and the \u03b3RS\u2217 terms\nin Eq. (23). Neglecting O(\u01eb2 ) terms, we find\n\u03b20\nTF NF\n+\u01eb\n;\n2\n3\n2TF NF \u2212 Nc\n\u03b20\n+\u01eb\n;\n\u03b3FDH (g) =\n2\n6\n\n\u03b3CDR (g) = \u03b3HV (g) =\n\n\u03b3CDR (q) = \u03b3HV (q) =\n\u03b3FDH (q) =\n\n3CF\n2\n\n3CF\nCF\n+\u01eb\n2\n2\n(26)\n\nwith \u03b20 = (11Nc \u2212 4 TF NF )/3 and TF = 1/2. For heavy quarks the result is\nrs independent [14] and we have \u03b3(Q) = CF .\nvirt\nThe final virtual corrections d\u03c3RS\n\u2217 are obtained as\nZ\n(1)\nvirt\nd\u03c3RS\u2217 (a1 . . . an ) = d\u03a6n\u22122 (p1 . . . pn ) hMRS\u2217 (a1 . . . an )i.\n(27)\nSince this phase space integration does not give rise to any pole in \u01eb, taking the\n(1)\nlimit D \u2192 4 in MNS is justified.\n\n10\n\n\f2.3\n\nReal corrections\n\nreal\nFor the real corrections d\u03c3RS\n\u2217 to the partonic process a1 a2 \u2192 a3 . . . an we have\nto consider contributions from all 2 \u2192 (n \u2212 1) processes that are obtained by\na split of any of the outgoing partons. We have to evaluate the corresponding\n(0)\nsquared matrix elements MRS (a1 , a2 ; \u01013 . . . \u0101n+1 ) and integrate them over the (n\u2212\n1) parton phase space d\u03a6n\u22121 (p1 , p2 ; p3 . . . pn+1 )\nXZ\n(0)\nreal\nd\u03c3RS\u2217 =\nd\u03a6n\u22121 (p1 , p2 ; p3 . . . pn+1 )hMRS\u2217 (a1 , a2 ; \u01013 . . . \u0101n+1 )i.\n(28)\n\u0101i\n\nIn Eq. (28) we denote\nPby \u0101i , i \u2208 {3 . . . n + 1} the flavour of the outgoing partons,\nand as indicated by \u0101i , we have to sum over all relevant processes.\nAs is well known, the matrix elements can develop singularities in regions of\nthe phase space where a parton becomes soft or two partons become collinear.\nThe integration over d\u03a6n\u22121 (p1 . . . pn+1 ) in this region then results in 1/\u01eb2 and 1/\u01eb\npoles. Thus the rs dependence of the matrix elements which manifests itself in\n(0)\nthe O(\u01eb) terms of MRS results in differences in the O(1/\u01eb) and in the finite terms\nof the real corrections.4\nIn order to deal with the phase-space integration at NLO one often uses either\nphase-space slicing [28] or subtraction [26,29], and several general procedures have\nbeen developed [27, 30, 31]. For our purposes it is sufficient to know that they all\nrely on the same main points. Using the results given below it will be obvious\nhow any of these procedures can be applied in the context of dred.\nThe first point is that in any of the singular regions the matrix elements take\na simple form and can be written as a factor containing the kinematic singularity times a reduced (colour-linked) tree-level matrix element, associated with\na 2 \u2192 (n \u2212 2) process. Secondly, the phase space is factorized according to\nd\u03a6n\u22121 (p1 . . . pn+1 ) = d\u03a6n\u22122 (p\u20321 . . . p\u2032n ) d\u03a6rad . The factor with the kinematic singularity is integrated analytically over d\u03a6rad , producing the poles in analytic form.\nThese poles will be multiplied by the reduced (colour-linked) matrix element\nand are to be integrated over a slightly modified (n \u2212 2) parton phase space\nd\u03a6n\u22122 (p\u20321 . . . p\u2032n ). It is therefore not surprising that the real corrections have a\nsimilar structure as the virtual corrections, Eqs. (23) and (27). We will now look\nat all three potentially singular regions in turn.\nSoft Region: In the limit where gluon gk (or another massless gauge boson)\nbecomes soft we have\nX sij\np \u21920\n(0)\nMij\n(a1 . . . an ),\n(29)\nMRS\u2217 (a1 , a2 ; . . . gk (pk ) . . . \u0101n+1 ) k= gs2\nRS\u2217\nsik sjk\ni,j\n4\nNote that in the hv and fdh schemes real soft and/or collinear gluons have to be treated\nas \"internal\", i.e. in the same way as gluons in a closed loop but differently from observed,\n\"external\" gluons. This is the only source of the rs dependence of the real corrections in these\nschemes.\n\n11\n\n\fwhere we introduced gs2 = 4\u03c0 \u03b1s . It is understood that the set of partons\n{a3 . . . an } is equal to the set {\u01013 . . . gk . . . \u0101n+1 } with gk removed. Similar comments apply to the\nR analogous equations below. The phase space integration of\nEq. (29) leads to d\u03a6rad sij /(sik sjk ) and results in poles that cancel the corresponding poles in V(i, j). Due to the measurement function implicitly included\nin d\u03a6n\u22122 , the remaining integration does not result in any singularities. The\nscheme dependence enters only through Mij\nRS\u2217 and after summation over all real\nprocesses trivially cancels between the real and virtual corrections.\nFinal-State Collinear Region: In the limit where two outgoing partons \u0101k and\n\u0101l become collinear we have\npk kpl\n\n(0)\n\nMRS\u2217 (a1 , a2 ; . . . \u0101l (pl ) . . . \u0101k (pk ) . . . \u0101n+1 ) =\n2 gs2 < RS\u2217\n(0)\nP(kl)\u2217 \u2192kl (z) MRS\u2217 (a1 , a2 ; . . . a(kl) (pk + pl ) . . . an ).\nskl\n\n(30)\n\n< RS\u2217\nis the rs dependent splitting function defined\nAs detailed in Appendix A, P(kl)\n\u2217\n\u2192kl\nfor z < 1 with pk \u2192 z(pk + pl ) and pl \u2192 (1 \u2212 z)(pk + pl ). In Eq. (30) the flavours\n\u0101k and \u0101l are fixed. This uniquely determines the flavour of the parent parton\n< RS\u2217\na(kl) . It is understood that if the split is flavour forbidden we set P(kl)\n= 0.\n\u2217\n\u2192kl\nTo avoid a proliferation of subscripts, we denote the flavour of the partons in the\nsplitting functions simply by (kl) etc. rather than a(kl) . The parent parton is\nslightly off shell as indicated by the notation (kl)\u2217 .\nContrary to the soft limit, in the collinear limit there are two sources of\n(0)\nrs dependence. Apart from the trivial dependence through MRS\u2217 (a1 . . . an ), the\n< RS\u2217\nis also rs dependent. Its rs dependence can be found in\nprefactor P(kl)\n\u2217\n\u2192kl\nSection 1.3 and in Appendix A.R Since the z dependence in Eq.

(28). Note that in the sum ak \u2208 {g, q, q\u0304} a sum over the NF\nmassless quark flavours is implicitly understood. After this sum the integrand is\nsymmetric with respect to z \u2194 1 \u2212 z. Hence the integration can be restricted to\nthe region z > 1/2 and the potential singularity at z = 1 is regularized with the\nusual +prescription. The z integration in Eq. (31) results in a rs dependence of\nthe singular prefactor that multiplies the Born term. In fact, the factor in the\nsecond line of Eq. (31) is equal to (\u2212\u03b3RS\u2217 (ai )).

There are some important differences with respect to Eq. (30). To start with, the collinear limit has\n(0)\nto be written with the spin/colour summed/averaged matrix elements hMRS\u2217 i.\nWith pk \u2192 (1 \u2212 z)p1 the collinear limit is given by\npk kp1\n\n(0)\n\nhMRS\u2217 (a1 (p1 ), a2 ; . . . \u0101k (pk ) . . . \u0101n+1 )i =\n2 gs2 < RS\u2217\n(0)\nP1\u2192(1k)\u2217 k (z) hMRS\u2217 (a(1k) (z p1 ), a2 ; . . . an )i.\ns1k\n\n(32)\n\nContrary to Eq. (30), the z dependence in Eq. (32) is not restricted to the prefactor and, therefore, the z-integration results in a more complicated structure.\nIn Eq. (32) the flavours a1 and \u0101k are fixed and uniquely determine the flavour of\nparton a(1k) , which is slightly off shell. The splitting functions of Eqs. (30) and\n(32), with initial/final-state off-shell parton, are related by a crossing relation\n\u0012 \u0013\n1\n< RS\u2217\n#f +1 \u03c9RS (a(lk) )\n< RS\u2217\nPl\u2192(lk)\u2217 k (z) = (\u22121)\n,\n(33)\nz P(lk)\u2217 \u2192lk\n\u03c9RS\u2217 (al )\nz\nwhere #f denotes the number of crossed fermions. We remark that the well< CDR\n< CDR\nknown crossing symmetry Pl\u2192(lk)\n\u2217 k = Pl\u2217 \u2192(lk)k does not hold in all rs, and in\ngeneral we have\n< RS\u2217\n< RS\u2217\nRS\u2217\nPl\u2192(lk)\n(34)\n\u2217 k (z) = Pl\u2217 \u2192(lk)k (z) + \u2206l\u2192(lk)k (z)\nwith \u2206FDH 6= 0 and \u2206HV 6= 0. The explicit form of \u2206FDH and \u2206HV can easily be\nfound using Eq. (33) and the results in Appendix A. However, as will be discussed\nin Section 2.4, the distinction made in Eq. (34) is ultimately not required.\nUsing Eqs. (34) and (86) to express the collinear limit, Eq. (32), in terms of\nRS\u2217\nthe full splitting functions P1\u2192(1k)k\nand summing over all relevant real processes,\n13\n\n\f+\n\n+\n\nFigure 3: Illustration of Eq.\nP (35) for an incoming splitting gluon. The sum over\nall relevant real processes, ak , gives rise to three terms.\nwe can write the initial state collinear term for parton 1 schematically as\n\u0014\n\u03b1s c \u0393\n(0)\nreal,1\nd\u03c3RS\u2217 (a1 . . . an ) =\n\u03b3RS\u2217 (a1 ) d\u03c3RS\u2217 (a1 (p1 ), a2 ; . . . an )\n(35)\n2\u03c0 \u01eb\n\u0015\nXZ\n\u0001 (0)\nRS\u2217\nRS\u2217\n\u2212\ndz P1\u2192(1k)k + \u22061\u2192(1k)k d\u03c3RS\u2217 (a(1k) (z p1 ), a2 ; . . . an ) .\nak\n\nThe first term on the r.h.s. of Eq. (35) is due to the \u03b4(1 \u2212 z) term present in\nEq. (86). Together with the corresponding term for the second incoming parton,\nreal,2\nd\u03c3RS\n\u2217 , this results in a term that precisely cancels the singularity and the rs\ndependence of those virtual terms displayed in the first line of Eq. (23) that are\nassociated with incoming partons i \u2264 2. The remaining terms given in the second\nline on the r.h.s. of Eq. (35) are associated with collinear counterterms.\n\n2.4\n\nCollinear counterterm\n\nvirt\nreal\nIn the sum of the virtual and real corrections, d\u03c3RS\n\u2217 + d\u03c3RS\u2217 , all singularities and\nrs dependences cancel, apart from the terms given in the last line of Eq. (35).\ncoll\nThese are cancelled by the collinear counterterm d\u03c3RS\n\u2217 . While the divergent parts\nof the collinear counterterms are completely determined, there is some freedom in\ncoll\nhow to specify the finite parts of d\u03c3RS\n\u2217 . Any specific choice of the finite parts of\ncoll\nd\u03c3RS\u2217 is equivalent to the definition of a particular factorization scheme. Leaving\nthe factorization scheme open, we can write\nZ\n\u03b1s c \u0393 X\ncoll\nd\u03c3RS\u2217,FS (a1 , a2 ; . . . an ) =\ndz\n(36)\n2\u03c0 \u01eb a\nk\n\u0014\n(0)\nRS\u2217\n\u2217\nFS\n\u00d7\n(P1\u2192ik\n(z) + \u2206RS\n1\u2192ik (z) + \u01ebX1\u2192ik (z)) d\u03c3RS\u2217 (ai (z p1 ), a2 (p2 ); . . . an )\n\u0015\n(0)\nRS\u2217\nRS\u2217\nFS\n+ (P2\u2192ik (z) + \u22062\u2192ik (z) + \u01ebX2\u2192ik (z)) d\u03c3RS\u2217 (a1 (p1 ), ai (z p2 ); . . . an ) ,\n\nwhere the sum is over all possible splittings of the incoming partons, and the\nFS\nindex i is defined in analogy to Eqs. (30) and (31). The Xl\u2192ik\nare the finite\n14\n\n\f(i.e. \u01eb-independent), rs independent terms which define the factorization scheme.\nThe formulas in Sections 2.2 and 2.3 show that in this way the hard (subtracted)\npartonic cross section\nh\nBorn\nd\u03c3\u0302FS (a1 . . . an ) = d\u03c3RS\n(37)\n\u2217 (a1 . . . an )\ni\nvirt\nreal\ncoll\n+ d\u03c3RS\n\u2217 (a1 . . . an ) + d\u03c3RS\u2217 (a1 . . . an ) + d\u03c3RS\u2217,FS (a1 . . . an )\nD\u21924\n\nis finite and rs independent as indicated by the absence of the subscript RS. In\nthis approach the most natural factorization scheme would correspond to setting\nall X FS = 0. In principle, this particular factorization scheme is as good as\nany other, and it could be used in practice in Eq. (1) in conjunction with parton\ndistribution functions fai /H determined in the same scheme. In practice, however,\nparton distribution functions such as the standard MRST or CTEQ sets [17, 18]\nare mainly available in the MS factorization scheme, which is different.\nThe MS factorization scheme is defined by using rs=cdr and replacing the\nsquare bracket in Eq. (36) by\n\u0014\n\u0015\n(0)\nCDR\n[P1\u2192ik (z)]D\u21924 d\u03c3CDR (ai (z p1 ), a2 ; . . . an ) + {1 \u2194 2} .\n(38)\nThe minimal subtraction procedure corresponds to setting \u01eb \u2192 0 in the splitting\nCDR\nfunctions P1\u2192ik\n. Thus, even if we use cdr (and even though \u2206CDR\n1\u2192ik = 0) the MS\nFS\nscheme does not correspond to X = 0 but to\nMS\nMS \u01eb\n\u01ebX1\u2192ik\n(z) = \u2212P1\u2192ik\n(z),\n\n(39)\n\nMS \u01eb\nCDR\nCDR\n(z) \u2261 P1\u2192ik\n(z) \u2212[P1\u2192ik\n(z)]D\u21924 denote the O(\u01eb) terms of the splitting\nwhere P1\u2192ik\nfunctions in cdr.\nIn the evaluation of the real corrections, Eq. (35), as well as in the collinear\nRS\u2217\n< RS\u2217\ncounterterm, Eq. (36), we made the distinction between Pl<\u2217 \u2192ik\nand Pl\u2192i\n\u2217 k , the\nsplitting functions appropriate for an outgoing and incoming split, respectively.\nIn a general rs, these two splitting functions differ as indicated in Eq. (34), hence\nthe presence of the \u2206 terms in Eqs. (35) and (36). While the expressions given in\nEqs. (35) and (36) are those that naturally arise in the calculation, we note that\nreal\ncoll\nRS\u2217\nthe \u2206 terms cancel in the sum of d\u03c3RS\n\u2217 + d\u03c3RS\u2217,FS . Thus we can drop \u22061\u2192(1k)k\nreal,2\nRS\u2217\nin Eq. (35) (and the corresponding term in d\u03c3RS\n\u2217 ) if we also drop \u22061\u2192ik (and\n< RS\u2217\n< RS\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2206RS\n2\u2192ik ) in Eq. (36). Ultimately, the distinction between Pl\u2217 \u2192ik and Pl\u2192i\u2217 k is not\nneeded.\n\n3\n\nDimensional Reduction\n\nIn this section we show how the structure described in Section 2 can be generalized\nto include dred. As mentioned in the introduction, the key point is to split the\n15\n\n\fgluon into a D-dimensional gluon \u011d and a (4\u2212D)-dimensional \u01eb-scalar g\u0303 by setting\ng = \u011d + g\u0303 and using Eq. (9). Often it is sufficient to perform this split for only\none gluon as in Eq. (9); in general, if a process contains #g gluons, gi1 . . . gi#g ,\nwe can decompose the matrix element in dred into 2#g terms according to\nX\nX\nMDRED (. . . gi1 . . . gi#g . . .) =\n...\nMDRED (. . . \u011fi1 . . . \u011fi#g . . .). (40)\n\u011fi1 \u2208{\u011d,g\u0303}\n\n\u011fi#g \u2208{\u011d,g\u0303}\n\nWe consider the two partons \u011d and g\u0303 to be two different partons and consequently\nregard the r.h.s of Eq. (40) as a sum over the squared matrix elements of 2#g\ndifferent processes. To bring our notation in line with the previous section, we\nwill write Eq. (9) and Eq. (40) as\nX\nMDRED (a1 . . . \u0103i . . . an ),\n(41)\nMDRED (a1 . . . ai . . . an ) =\n\u0103i\n\nMDRED (a1 . . . an ) =\n\nX\n\nMDRED (\u01031 . . . \u0103n ),\n\n(42)\n\n{\u0103}\n\nrespectively, where it is understood that if ai = g we sum over the two terms\n\u0103i \u2208 {\u011d, g\u0303} whereas if ai = q there is only one term in the sum \u0103i \u2208 {q}.\nFor the spin summed/averaged matrix elements the relation equivalent to\nEq. (42) reads\nhMDRED(a1 , a2 ; . . . an )i =\n\nX \u03c9DRED (\u01031 ) \u03c9DRED(\u01032 )\nhMDRED (\u01031 , \u01032 ; . . . \u0103n )i. (43)\n\u03c9DRED (a1 ) \u03c9DRED(a2 )\n{\u0103}\n\nThe explicit expressions for \u03c9RS (ai ) are given in the Appendix in Eq. (85).\nWe stress that while the split g = \u011d + g\u0303 is conceptually simple, it seems to\ncomplicate practical computations. As we will see in the later sections, however,\nin an explicit computation of a physical process in dred it is only required at a\nvery limited number of steps. In particular, it will turn out that no PDF for the\nunphysical \u01eb-scalar g\u0303 will be required.\nIn the present section we will use the split to understand the infrared structure\nof matrix elements in dred. In fact, it is straightforward to see that Eqs. (23),\n(30), and (32) for the collinear singularities of virtual and real corrections hold in\nthe same form in dred for the individual processes with split partons, i.e. if we\nreplace RS\u2217 \u2192 DRED and ai \u2192 \u0103i in these equations. However, our main interest\nare the infrared properties and rs dependences of matrix elements for full gluons;\ntherefore we will carry out the sums over {\u0103i } wherever possible.\n\n16\n\n\f3.1\n\nBorn term\n\nThe full tree-level matrix element in dred is equal to the one in fdh and hv and\ncan be obtained from the cdr result simply by setting D \u2192 4\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\nMDRED (a1 . . . an ) = MHV (a1 . . . an ) = MFDH (a1 . . . an )\nh\ni\n(0)\n= MCDR (a1 . . . an )\n.\n\n(44)\n\nD\u21924\n\nThe Born cross section in dred can be obtained from Eq. (44) and satisfies\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\nd\u03c3DRED (a1 . . . an ) = d\u03c3HV (a1 . . . an ) = d\u03c3FDH (a1 . . . an ).\n\n3.2\n\n(45)\n\nVirtual corrections\n\nThe structure of the virtual corrections in dred is analogous to Eq. (23) for\neach individual dred process with split partons \u0103i . Hence, by summing over all\nprocesses as in Eq. (42) we obtain\n!\n\"\nX \u03b1s\n1X\n(0)\n(1)\n\u03b3DRED (\u0103i ) (46)\nc\u0393 MDRED (\u01031 . . . \u0103n ) \u2212\nMDRED (a1 . . . an ) =\n2\u03c0\n\u01eb i\n{\u0103}\n#\nX\n(1)\n+\nV(i, j) Mij\nDRED (\u01031 . . . \u0103n ) + MNS (\u01031 . . . \u0103n ) .\ni,j\n\nThe non-trivial structure of Eq. (46) is most essential for the \u03b3 terms, since\n\u03b3DRED (\u011d) 6= \u03b3DRED(g\u0303). In fact, as discussed in Section 1.3 and Appendix A, the \u03b3\nfor \u011d and q match the ones in the fdh scheme, while the one for g\u0303 is new and\ndifferent:\n\u03b20\n2TF NF \u2212 Nc\n+\u01eb\n,\n2\n6\n3CF\n\u03b3DRED (q) = \u03b3FDH (q) =\n,\n2\n\u03b3DRED (g\u0303) = 2Nc \u2212 TF NF .\n\n\u03b3DRED (\u011d) = \u03b3FDH (g) =\n\n(47a)\n(47b)\n(47c)\n\nOn the other hand, V(i, j) is not affected if a \u011d is replaced by a g\u0303, and the\nBorn terms in the last line on the r.h.s. of Eq. (46) can be combined in a straightforward way. Hence one can immediately obtain the result for either the fully\n(1)\n(1)\nor the partially combined process, MDRED (a1 . . . an ) or MDRED (\u01031 , \u01032 ; a3 . . . an ), if\ndesired. In particular, the dred result for the process involving only full gluons\n\n17\n\n\fsatisfies\n\"\n\u0012\n\u0013\nXX\n\u03b1\n1\ns\n(1)\n(0)\nMDRED (a1 . . . an ) =\nc\u0393\nMDRED (a1 . . . \u0103i . . . an ) \u2212 \u03b3DRED (\u0103i )\n2\u03c0\n\u01eb\ni\n\u0103i\n#\nX\n(1)\n+\nV(i, j) Mij\n(a1 . . . an ) + MNS (a1 . . . an ) ,\n(48)\nDRED\ni,j\n\n(1)\n\nij\nwhere Mij\nDRED (a1 . . . an ) = MFDH (a1 . . . an ) and MNS (a1 . . . an ) is the rs independent term appearing also in Eq. (23).\n(1)\nWe recall that MDRED denotes the fully renormalized one-loop matrix element\nand Eq. (46) does not contain any ultraviolet singularities. In dred this implies\nthat off-shell Green functions are finite also if external g\u0303 are present. This requires\nthat couplings involving \u011d and couplings involving g\u0303 in general renormalize differently [24]. As a result, the renormalization procedure in non-supersymmetric\ntheories can be slightly more involved in dred. We refer to Appendix B for\nexamples.\n\n3.3\n\nReal corrections\n\nThe calculation of the real corrections in dred follows the same pattern as in\nthe other schemes discussed in Section 2.3. However, there are some important\ndifferences which we will consider for the three singular regions in turn.\nSoft Region: In close analogy to Eq. (29), we have to consider the limit of\nthe real matrix element when a gluon becomes soft. In dred this soft gluon\ncan be either a \u011d or a g\u0303. The soft limit is governed by eikonal factors of the\nform p\u03bci p\u03bdj /(sik sjk ), contracted with the corresponding polarization sum of the\nsoft gluon \u011fk . The polarization sums in Eq. (10) then show that a soft \u011dk leads\nto the same limit as a soft full gluon gk , while a soft \u01eb-scalar g\u0303k leads to zero.\nHence,\nX sij\np \u21920\n(0)\nMDRED (a1 , a2 ; . . . gk (pk ) . . . \u0101n+1 ) k= gs2\nMij\n(49)\nDRED (a1 . . . an ),\nsik sjk\ni,j\n(0)\n\np \u21920\n\nMDRED (a1 , a2 ; . . . g\u0303k (pk ) . . . \u0101n+1 ) k= 0.\n\n(50)\n\nIn analogy to the behaviour of V(i, j) in the virtual corrections, the soft limit\nEq. (49) does not require the split gk = \u011dk + g\u0303k . Thus, with respect to the soft\nlimit, dred is equivalent to hv and fdh.\nFinal-State Collinear Region: Here the split g = \u011d + g\u0303 is essential. According\nto the main result of Ref. [7], the key equation for the collinear limit, Eq. (30),\nhas to be modified in dred if the parent parton a(kl) is a gluon.

(52) forP\nthe case of an outgoing splitting gluon. The\nsum over all relevant real processes, ak , together with the sum due to the split\n\u0103i \u2208 {\u011d, g\u0303} gives rise to four terms, resulting in the Nc and NF parts of \u03b3DRED (\u011d)\nand \u03b3DRED (g\u0303) respectively. Gluons g and (anti)quarks are drawn as usual. Dashed\nlines represent g\u0303 and \u011d is represented by a zigzag line.\n\nflavour of the parent parton is not uniquely determined by \u0101k and \u0101l and we have\nto sum over the two possibilities \u0103(kl) \u2208 {\u011d, g\u0303}. Thus, in dred Eq. (30) becomes\npk kpl\n\n(0)\n\nMDRED (a1 , a2 ; . . . \u0101l (pl ) . . . \u0101k (pk ) . . . \u0101n+1 ) =\n2 gs2 X < DRED\n(0)\nP(kl)\u2217 \u2192kl (z) MDRED (a1 , a2 ; . . . \u0103(kl) (pk + pl ) . . . an ).\nskl \u0103\n\n(51)\n\n(kl)\n\nWe remark that Eq. (51) leads us to consider splitting functions with \u0103(kl) = \u011d\nand \u0103(kl) = g\u0303 in dred. They are given in Appendix A. Eq. (51) remains true if\nall partons aj are replaced by \u0103j , however, only for \u0103i = \u0103(kl) the split is strictly\nrequired. Thus, Eq. (31) is modified to\n\u03b1s c\u0393 X (0)\nreal,i\nd\u03c3DRED\n(a1 . . . ai . . . an ) = \u2212\nd\u03c3DRED (a1 . . . \u0103i . . . an )\n(52)\n2\u03c0 \u01eb \u0103\ni\n\u0012\n\u0013\nXZ\n1 (1 \u2212 z) < DRED\n\u00d7\ndz \u0398 z \u2212\nPi\u2217 \u2192kl (z) .\n2\n(1\n\u2212\nz)\n+\na\nk\n\nThis is illustrated in Figure 4, where we consider the particularly interesting case\nof an outgoing splitting gluon. For each choice \u0103i \u2208 {\u011d, g\u0303} we have to sum over\nall splittings ak \u2208 {g, q, q\u0304}. Thus, the two terms of Figure 2 become the four\nterms of Figure 4.\nInitial-State Collinear Region: As for the final-state collinear region, the key\npoint is the necessary split g = \u011d + g\u0303 in the factorization of the collinear limit.\nIn dred, Eq.

The sum over all relevant real processes, ak , together\nwith the sum due to the split \u0103(1k) \u2208 {\u011d, g\u0303} gives rise to four terms.\nAgain, as far as the collinear limit is concerned, not all gluons in Eq. (53) have\nto be split. Only for the virtual parton \u0103(1k) the split is essential.\nNote that in dred the crossed splitting functions satisfy the crossing relation\nEq. (34) without \u2206 terms. Hence, the initial state collinear term for parton 1\ncan be written as\n\u0014\n\u03b1s c \u0393 X\n(0)\nreal,1\nd\u03c3DRED (a1 . . . an ) =\n\u03b3DRED (\u01031 ) d\u03c3DRED (\u01031 (p1 ), a2 ; . . . an ) (54)\n2\u03c0 \u01eb\n\u01031\n\u0015\nXXZ\n(0)\nDRED\n\u2212\ndz P1\u2192(1k)k d\u03c3DRED (\u0103(1k) (z p1 ), a2 ; . . . an ) .\nak \u0103(1k)\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 5, in the sum over \u0103(1k) in Eq. (54) it is essential that we\ntreat \u011d and g\u0303 as separate partons, whereas ak \u2208 {g, q, q\u0304}.

(2) cancel, and we found that the subtracted\npartonic cross sections given in Eqs. (37) and (57) are finite and rs independent.\nThis is precisely what we wanted to achieve. However, there is still one conceptual\nissue to be addressed.\nThe question is whether in the convolution of subtracted partonic cross sections with PDF we need to distinguish between \u011d and g\u0303 in DRED. We will show\nthat this is not the case. This will also entail that no PDF for finding an unphysical g\u0303 in a hadron will be required.\nOnce this issue is clarified, we will summarize our results and give transition\nrules between the various rs separately for all parts of the subtracted finite\npartonic cross sections.\n5\n\nThe \u2206 terms appearing in the hv and fdh schemes, see Eqs. (35) and (36), have been\nignored. According to the remark at the end of Section 2.4 this is correct if the \u2206 terms are\nalso ignored in the real corrections.\n\n21\n\n\f4.1\n\nParton distribution functions in DRED\n\nThe results Eqs. (37) and (57) have been given without taking into account that\nthe subtracted partonic cross sections have to be multiplied by PDF. In dred\nit might seem natural to distinguish partonic cross sections with \u011d or g\u0303 in the\ninitial state and convolute them with different PDF. We will show that this is not\nrequired and that we can use Eq. (57) for initial state full gluons g, convoluted\nwith just one PDF even in DRED. In particular, there is no need to introduce\nunphysical PDF for finding a g\u0303 in a hadron.\nIn the strict spirit of dred it is correct to consider independent PDF for \u011d\nand g\u0303 and write a hadronic cross section as a sum of the form\nf\u011d/H \u2297 d\u03c3\u0302FS (\u011d1 . . .) + fg\u0303/H \u2297 d\u03c3\u0302FS (g\u03031 . . .) + fq/H \u2297 d\u03c3\u0302FS (q1 . . .) + fq\u0304/H \u2297 d\u03c3\u0302FS (q\u03041 . . .).\n(60)\nThe partonic cross sections d\u03c3\u0302(\u011f1 ) can be constructed in the same way as Eq. (57).\nThey are individually finite and satisfy\nX X \u03c9DRED (\u01031 ) \u03c9DRED (\u01032 )\n\u01031\n\n\u01032\n\n\u03c9DRED (a1 ) \u03c9DRED (a2 )\n\nd\u03c3\u0302FS (\u01031 , \u01032 ; . . . an ) = d\u03c3\u0302FS (a1 , a2 ; . . . an ).\n\n(61)\n\nAll the PDF in Eq. (60) would be obtained by performing a fit at one particular\nfactorization scale \u03bc0 and then using Altarelli-Parisi equations to evolve them to\nany other scale \u03bc.\nThe central point is that the unphysical PDF fg\u0303/H is of the order \u01eb, and hence\nits contributions to both the hadronic cross section, Eq. (60), and to the evolution\nof the other PDF are of the order \u01eb and thus negligible.\nIn order to prove this we start by noting that since in other regularization\nschemes one gluon PDF fg/H is sufficient it is possible to arrange the fit in dred\nsuch that fg\u0303/H (\u03bc0 ) = 0 at the starting scale \u03bc0 . The evolution is given by the\nAltarelli-Parisi equations, generalized to include g\u0303:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nZ 1\nPq\u2192q P\u011d\u2192q Pg\u0303\u2192q\nfq/H (\u03be)\nfq/H (z)\nd\u03be \uf8ed\n\u03b1s\n\u2202\nPq\u2192\u011d P\u011d\u2192\u011d Pg\u0303\u2192\u011d \uf8f8 \uf8ed f\u011d/H (\u03be) \uf8f8 , (62)\n\u03bc2 2 \uf8ed f\u011d/H (z) \uf8f8 =\n\u2202\u03bc\n2\u03c0 z \u03be\nPq\u2192g\u0303 P\u011d\u2192g\u0303 Pg\u0303\u2192g\u0303\nfg\u0303/H (\u03be)\nfg\u0303/H (z)\nwhere we have suppressed the \u03bc dependence of \u03b1s and fai /H and have used the\nDRED\nshort-hand notation Pi\u2192j \u2261 Pi\u2192j(ij)\n(z/\u03be). The evolution of fg\u0303/H (z) gets contributions from Pq\u2192g\u0303 \u00d7 fq/H , P\u011d\u2192g\u0303 \u00d7 f\u011d/H and Pg\u0303\u2192g\u0303 \u00d7 fg\u0303/H . They are O(\u01eb) \u00d7 1, O(\u01eb) \u00d7 1\nand 1 \u00d7 O(\u01eb), respectively, confirming that fg\u0303/H (\u03bc) = O(\u01eb) for all scales \u03bc. This\nin turn implies that the contribution to the evolution of fq/H and f\u011d/H due to\nfg\u0303/H is also O(\u01eb). The situation is in fact very similar to the contributions due\nto quarks if there were NF = \u01eb flavours. Finally, d\u03c3\u0302FS (\u01031 , \u01032 ; . . . an ) as appearing\nin Eqs. (60) and (61) is finite for all initial states \u01031 , \u01032 separately. Hence the\ncontribution of the unphysical PDF fg\u0303/H in Eq. (60) is O(\u01eb).\n22\n\n\fThis confirms that dred can be used throughout all parts of calculations for\nhadronic cross sections at one loop, without the need for unphysical PDF. It is\ncorrect to consider only one gluon PDF fg/H and the combined cross sections\nd\u03c3\u0302(a1 , a2 ; . . . an ) from Eq. (57) also in dred. In other words, Eq. (1) is correct\nin all schemes, including dred, if the sums over all parton types include only the\nfull gluon g and quarks q, q\u0304 (and possibly further, massive partons).\n\n4.2\n\nSummary of practical computations in DRED\n\nLet us finally summarize how to do a next-to-leading order calculation in practice\nin dred or any other scheme. The main point is that only for the ultraviolet\nrenormalization and the collinear counterterm a split of g into \u011d + g\u0303 is required.\nVirtual Corrections: To obtain the virtual corrections we start by computing\nMRS (a1 . . . an ) with ai \u2208 {g, q, q\u0304}. For the actual calculation of the one-loop\ndiagrams we do not need to split the process into many different parts as in\nEq. (46), but can compute directly with g. The structure of the ultraviolet\ncounterterms depends on the rs and the symmetries of the underlying theory. If\ndred is used in a supersymmetric context, even the counterterms can typically be\ncomputed without the split, and usual multiplicative renormalization is sufficient\nto generate the counterterms. Using hv or cdr in supersymmetric theories leads\nto the complication of non-multiplicative, supersymmetry-restoring counterterms.\nIn non-supersymmetric theories, determining counterterms in dred requires the\nsplit g = \u011d + g\u0303.\n(1)\nOnce we have the renormalized one-loop matrix element, MRS (a1 . . . an ) we\nvirt\nvirt\nobtain d\u03c3RS\nby integration over the phase space. Again, a split of d\u03c3RS\nas in\nEq. (61) is not required. The split g = \u011d + g\u0303 for external gluons becomes useful\nif we want to express the singularity structure or rs dependence in a simple way\nas done in the next subsection.\n(1)\n\nReal Corrections: The real corrections in dred can be obtained in a straightforward way by directly integrating the 4-dimensional tree-level matrix elements\ncontaining only 4-dimensional gluons g and (anti)quarks. Likewise, in cdr we\nhave to integrate the D-dimensional tree-level matrix elements. Regarding the\nreal corrections in hv and fdh we remind the reader of a subtlety related to\nunitarity (see also Ref. [15]). At first sight it might appear that there is no differreal\nence in d\u03c3RS\nfor schemes where the tree-level matrix elements are evaluated in\nreal\nreal\nfour dimensions, e.g. between d\u03c3HV\nand d\u03c3FDH\n. However, this is not correct. In\norder to maintain unitarity, in the singular regions initial and final state partons\nhave to be treated in the same way as partons in a closed loop, i.e. as \"internal\". Thus in hv and fdh it is not correct to simply integrate the corresponding\nfour-dimensional real tree-level matrix elements over the phase space. In particular, Eqs. (30) and (32) contain O(\u01eb) terms in fdh and hv and result in finite\nreal\nreal\ndifferences between d\u03c3HV\nand d\u03c3FDH\n, even though the tree-level matrix elements\n23\n\n\fagree.\nIn principle this procedure leads to the \u2206 terms in Eq. (35) because in the\nhv and fdh schemes incoming and outgoing splittings differ. As discussed in\nSection 2.4 it is possible to redefine the results by ignoring the \u2206 terms if the\nsame is done in the collinear counterterms.\nCollinear Counterterm: The collinear counterterm is given by Eq. (58). It\nrealizes the MS factorization scheme independent of the rs used for the computation. For dred, we stress that for the term given explicitly on the r.h.s. of\nEq. (58) the partons a1 . . . an as well as ak are never \u011d or g\u0303 separately, but can\nalways be combined to g. For the virtual parton \u0103i , however, it is important to\ntreat \u011d and g\u0303 separately [7]. This requires the use of the splitting functions given\nin Eqs. (98) and (99). For the hv and fdh schemes, the \u2206 terms can be ignored\nin accordance with the computation of the real corrections.\n\n4.3\n\nTranslation rules between different schemes\n\nIn the following we describe how the results in the various rs are related, making\nuse of the split g = \u011d + g\u0303 as appropriate. We will focus on the virtual corrections;\nsimilar results for the real corrections and the collinear counterterms can be\ntrivially obtained from Eqns. (52), (54), (58). Starting from our renormalized\n(1)\nresult in cdr, MCDR (a1 . . . an ), written in the form of Eq. (23), we can obtain\n(1)\nMHV (a1 . . . an ) simply by replacing the D dimensional (colour-linked) Born terms\nby the corresponding 4-dimensional expressions. No further change is required,\nsince \u03b3CDR (ai ) = \u03b3HV (ai ).\nThe only difference between the hv and fdh scheme on the other hand does\ncome from the differences of the \u03b3RS terms, which have been explained in Section 1.3 and quantitatively given in Eq. (26). For a process with #g gluons, #q\nmassless (anti)quarks and #Q massive (anti)quarks the difference is\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\nMFDH (a1 . . . an ) \u2212 MHV (a1 . . . an )\n\u0013\n\u0012\nX\n\u03b3HV (ax ) \u2212 \u03b3FDH (ax )\n\u03b1s\n(0)\nMFDH (a1 . . . an )\n#x\n=\n2\u03c0\n\u01eb\nx\u2208{g,q,Q}\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03b1s\nNc\nCF\n(0)\n=\n.\nMFDH (a1 . . . an ) #g\n+ #q\n2\u03c0\n6\n2\n\n(63)\n\nIn the second line the influence of the different \u03b3RS for all parton types is made\nexplicit, in the third line the result in brought into a compact form.\nThe difference between fdh and dred is obtained by taking the difference\nbetween Eqs. (48) and (23). We can bring it into a simple form by using that we\ncan write the tree-level quantities in fdh in a dred-like form,\nX (0)\n(0)\nMFDH (a1 . . . ai . . . an ) =\nMDRED (a1 . . . \u0103i . . . an ).\n(64)\n\u0103i\n\n24\n\n\fThe difference is then governed by the factors \u03b3DRED (\u011d) \u2212 \u03b3FDH (g) and \u03b3DRED (g\u0303) \u2212\n\u03b3FDH (g). As explained in Section 1.3 the first of these vanishes. The second is\nnon-zero,\n1+\u01eb\n(Nc \u2212 2 TF NF ) ,\n(65)\n\u03b3DRED (g\u0303) \u2212 \u03b3FDH (g) =\n6\nand is present for every g\u0303 in the initial or final state, see Eq. (48). Exploiting\nalso that at leading order \u03b1s = \u03b1e , we obtain\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\nMDRED (a1 . . . an ) \u2212 MFDH (a1 . . . an )\n\u03b1s \u03b3FDH (g) \u2212 \u03b3DRED (g\u0303) X\n(0)\n=\n#g\u0303({\u0103}) MDRED (\u01031 . . . \u0103n )\n2\u03c0\n\u01eb\n\n(66)\n\n{\u0103}\n\n#g\n\u03b1s 1 2 TF NF \u2212 Nc X\n(0)\n=\nMDRED(a1 . . . an )\n2\u03c0 \u01eb\n6\nj=1\n\ngij \u2192g\u0303ij\n\n.\n\nAgain, in the second line the influence of the different \u03b3RS relevant for g\u0303 is made\nexplicit. In the third line we used that for processes with at least one g\u0303, i.e. with\n(0)\n#g\u0303({\u0103}) \u2265 1 we have MDRED \u223c \u01eb; therefore we neglected the O(\u01eb) terms from\n(0)\nEq. (65). The notation MDRED(a1 . . . an ) gi \u2192g\u0303i implies that all gluons except\nj\n\nj\n\ngluon ij are 4-dimensional gluons. Thus in the final expression on the r.h.s. of\nEq. (66) we sum over all processes where one 4-dimensional gluon g at a time is\nreplaced by a g\u0303.\nThe transition rules Eqs. (63) and (66) ignore O(\u01eb) terms and are given for\npure QCD processes. However, they can easily be generalized to other processes,\ninvolving e.g. photons or massive partons, simply by using the corresponding\nexplicit expressions for \u03b3RS .\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nThe main result presented in this paper is that dred can be used for the calculation of cross sections at NLO, even for processes with hadrons in the initial\nstate. Problems related to factorization, as reported in the literature [8\u201310], can\nbe avoided by taking into account the appropriate, generalized factorization in\ndred [7]. We have shown explicitly how to use dred together with an arbitrary\nfactorization scheme. In particular, the conventional PDF [17, 18] in the MSfactorization scheme can be used. Also we have given explicit rules on how to\ntransform separately the various parts of the hard partonic cross section, Eq. (2),\nfrom dred to other rs. This completes the previously known set of transition\nrules between cdr, hv and fdh [13\u201315]. It is thus possible to use different rs\nfor different parts of the calculation which might help simplifying the explicit\ncomputations. In this context we also reiterate the distinction between fdh and\ndred. According to the definitions of the rs given in Section 1.2, at one loop\n25\n\n\ffdh is equivalent to the scheme dr used e.g. in Refs. [13\u201315] but differs from\ndred used e.g. in Refs. [3, 11, 12].\nThe salient feature of a consistent use of dred is the split g = \u011d + g\u0303. In\npractice, this split does not significantly complicate calculations. It is needed\nmainly for the correct treatment of the collinear limit of squared matrix elements. Thus it affects the collinear counterterm and the phase-space integration\nover the singular, collinear region. The modifications regarding the former are\nshown in Eqs. (35) and (54). For the phase-space integration, the usual procedures have to be slightly modified. For the method presented in Ref. [30] for\nexample, the collinear singularities in the real corrections are singled out using\ndistributions, enforcing the collinear limit of the real matrix element squared. If\nthis method is to be used together with dred this simply means that the proper\ncollinear limit, Eqs. (51) and (53), has to be taken. For the dipole subtraction\nmethod [27] additional dipoles with g\u0303 are required. These can be obtained making\nminor modifications of existing dipoles, similar to the corresponding adaptation\nto fdh [32].\nIn some cases, the split g = \u011d + g\u0303 is also required for the ultraviolet counterterms, since e.g. the couplings \u011dq q\u0304 and g\u0303q q\u0304 renormalize differently. This seems to\nbe a disadvantage of dred. On the other hand, one of the advantages of dred\nis that in supersymmetric theories no supersymmetry-restoring counterterms are\nrequired (in many practical cases; for a recent discussion see Ref. [3]). In this\ncase, also couplings with \u011d and g\u0303 renormalize identically and renormalization\nis actually simpler in dred than e.g. in cdr. This facilitates the use of the\nDR-scheme for supersymmetric parameters which is used in a wide variety of\ncalculations [33].\nThus, dred is a rs which is well compatible with supersymmetry and which\ncan be realized with minimal modifications compared to cdr and used for an arbitrary cross section at NLO. In the past, following the examples of e.g. Refs. [9,34],\nmany predictions for supersymmetric processes at hadron colliders were calculated using cdr in spite of the required supersymmetry-restoring counterterms.\nIn the future, similar calculations can alternatively be carried out using dred,\nwhich can lead to simplifications with the present, better understanding of dred.\nAcknowledgement\nThis work is supported in part by the European Community's Marie-Curie Research Training Network under contract MRTN-CT-2006-035505 'Tools and Precision Calculations for Physics Discoveries at Colliders'.\n\n26\n\n\fA\n\nCollinear limits and sum rules\n\nIn this appendix we study the collinear limit of squared matrix elements and\nderive the associated splitting functions and \u03b3RS terms. Even though most of the\nresults presented here are well known, we repeat them for the reader's convenience\nand to fix our notation and conventions.\nFollowing Ref. [15], we consider a slightly off-shell massless outgoing parton\nai (pi ) that splits into massless on-shell partons ak (pk ) and al (pl ). The momenta\nare parametrized as\n2\nn\u03bc\nk\u22a5\n,\nz 2 (p * n)\n2\nk\u22a5\nn\u03bc\n\u03bc\n= (1 \u2212 z) p\u03bc \u2212 k\u22a5\n\u2212\n,\n(1 \u2212 z) 2 (p * n)\n\n\u03bc\np\u03bck = z p\u03bc + k\u22a5\n\u2212\n\n(67)\n\np\u03bcl\n\n(68)\n\nwith p2 = n2 = (k\u22a5 * p) = (k\u22a5 * n) = 0. The invariant mass of the incoming parton\n\u03bc\n2\nis p2i = 2(pk * pl ) = \u2212k\u22a5\n/(z(1 \u2212 z)) and vanishes in the collinear limit k\u22a5\n\u2192 0.\nTo start with we consider the particularly interesting case where the parent\nparton is a gluon. Denoting by Am\n\u03bc the amplitude of the parent process, stripped\nof its polarization vector \u03b5\u03bc (pi ), we can write the collinear limit of the full process\nas\n(0)\n\npk kpl\n\nMRS (1 . . . g(pk ), g(pl ) . . . n + 1) =\n\n4\u03c0 \u03b1s\n< RS \u03bc\u03bd\n\u2217n\n\u03b4mn Am\n\u03bc Pgi\u2217 \u2192gk gl A\u03bd ,\npk * pl\n\n(69)\n\n\u03bc\nRS \u03bc\u03bd\nwhere m and n are colour labels.

The one-loop matrix elements MRS\u2217 (g, g; q, q\u0304)\nwere found to be related as given in Eq. (23). This and the related process with\nmassive quarks was also at the centre of claims regarding problems with factorization in dred [8\u201310]. The factorization issue related to the real corrections for\nthese processes has been solved in Ref. [7]. Here we focus on some aspects related\nto issues with dred, starting with the virtual corrections.\nThe calculation of the one-loop diagrams is straightforward and we stress once\nmore that there is no need to disentangle g into \u011d + g\u0303 in the explicit calculation\n30\n\n\f(1,ct)\n\nMDRED (\u011d, g\u0303; q, q\u0304) =\n\n(1,ct)\n\nMDRED (g\u0303, g\u0303; q, q\u0304) =\n\nFigure 6: Ultraviolet counterterm diagrams due to coupling renormalization\n(1,ct)\n\n(1,ct)\n\nMDRED (\u011d, g\u0303; q, q\u0304) (upper line) and MDRED (g\u0303, g\u0303; q, q\u0304) (lower line). Dark vertices\nrepresent counterterms \u03b4ZgDRED and bright vertices stand for counterterms \u03b4ZegDRED .\n(1)\n\nof the one-loop diagrams. The only issue in the computation of MDRED (g, g, q, q\u0304)\nis renormalization. For massless quarks we only have to consider coupling renormalization.

For this we need the\ncoupling renormalization factors ZgDRED for the \u011dq q\u0304 coupling and ZegDRED for the\ng\u0303q q\u0304 coupling.

(107) is determined by requiring the\ncancellation of UV singularities in the off-shell g\u0303g\u0303 Green function. The finite\nO(\u03b1s ) terms in Eq. (107) would have to be determined by a renormalization\nscheme. However, they will not affect the final result. As is to be expected,\n6\n\nWe have set \u03b1s = \u03b1e in these results. This is allowed since we are working at one loop.\n\n31\n\n\fthis allows us to perform the calculation without specifying a renormalization\n(1,ct)\nscheme for the unphysical gluons.

As illustrated in Figure 6, the coun(1,ct)\n(0)\nterterm MDRED (\u011d, g\u0303; q, q\u0304) is given by (\u03b4ZgDRED + \u03b4 ZegDRED )MDRED(\u011d, g\u0303; q, q\u0304), while\n(1,ct)\nMDRED (g\u0303, g\u0303; q, q\u0304) is not proportional to the corresponding tree-level amplitude.\nWe explicitly verified that after renormalization the one-loop matrix element\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(1,ct)\n\nMDRED (g, g; q, q\u0304) = M\u0304DRED (g, g; q, q\u0304) + MDRED (g, g; q, q\u0304)\n\n(108)\n\nin dred is related to the other schemes as given in Eq.

As explained in Ref. [7] and\nthe present paper, the factorization problem disappears if \u011d and g\u0303 are treated\nas separate partons in formulas such as Eqs. (53) and (54) or in the last line of\nEq. (109). The reason why the apparent problem has been found only in the\nmassive process gg \u2192 QQ\u0304 is not related to quark masses but to Eq. (112), which\nhappens to hold in the massless case.\nWith this in mind, the massive process can be treated in the same way as\nthe massless one. The only additional complication in the case of massive quarks\nRS\nis to consider the rs dependence of the mass renormalization Zm\nand external\nRS\nwave-function renormalization ZQ for massive quark lines. The rs dependence\nof these renormalization factors has been considered before (see e.g. Ref. [36])\nand, using for example the pole scheme to define the mass of the heavy quark m,\ncan be summarized as follows:\n\u0012 2 \u0013\u2212\u01eb \u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b1s c \u0393\n3\nm\nCDR\nHV\nZm\n= Zm = 1 +\n\u2212 \u22124 ,\nCF\n(114)\n4\u03c0 \u01eb\n\u03bc2\n\u01eb\n\u0012 2 \u0013\u2212\u01eb \u0012\n\u0013\n3\nm\n\u03b1s c \u0393\nDRED\nFDH\n\u2212 \u22125 ,\nCF\n(115)\nZm\n= Zm = 1 +\n4\u03c0 \u01eb\n\u03bc2\n\u01eb\nRS\nand ZQRS = Zm\n. As mentioned in the main text, \u03b3(Q) = CF is rs independent [14]. We have verified by explicit calculation that using the rs dependent\ncoupling renormalization and Eqs. (114) and (115) for the mass counterterms and\nwave-function renormalization, the rs dependence of the virtual corrections take\nthe form as given in Eq. (46). To use dred throughout in the calculation of this\nprocess we simply have to use the correct rs dependent collinear counterterm as\ngiven in Eq. (109) and fold the hard partonic cross sections with the standard\nPDF in the MS factorization scheme.\n\nB.3\n\ngg \u2192 h\n\nIn this example we consider the production of a Higgs h through gluon fusion\nin a hadronic collision. While this process is relatively simple at one-loop it is\ncomplicated enough to illustrate all main points discussed in the main text. The\ninteraction of the Higgs with gluons is given by the Lagrangian\n1\nLI = gh h tr (F \u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd ) ,\n2\n\n(116)\n\nwhere the coupling gh has mass dimension \u22121. In dred we have to distinguish\nbetween the coupling for \u011d\u011dh, denoted by gh and the coupling for g\u0303g\u0303h, denoted\nby g\u0303h . At tree level the two couplings are the same, but they differ at higher\norders.\n33\n\n\fThe only process that contributes at tree level is g(p1) g(p2) \u2192 h. The matrix\nelements are given by\n(0)\n\nMRS (\u011f, \u011f; h) = gh2 \u03c9RS (\u011f)\n\ns212\n4\n\n(117)\n(0)\n\nwith \u011f = g in cdr,hv and fdh and \u011f \u2208 {\u011d, g\u0303} for dred and MDRED (g\u0303, \u011d; h) = 0.\nFor the calculation of the O(\u03b1s ) corrections to g g \u2192 h the distinction between\ngh and g\u0303h at tree level will be relevant for the renormalization. Importantly,\nhowever, for the non-trivial part of the explicit calculation of the virtual and real\ncorrections we can set gh = g\u0303h and we do not have to distinguish between \u011d and\ng\u0303 in loop diagrams.\nFirst we discuss the virtual corrections and how their rs dependences arise.\nThe explicit calculation of the two non-vanishing one-loop diagrams in Feynman\ngauge results in the following unrenormalized one-loop matrix elements:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2212\u01eb\n\u03b1s\n2Nc\ns12\n(0)\n(1)\nM\u0304RS (\u011f1 , \u011f2 ; h) = MRS (\u011f1 , \u011f2 ; h)\n(118)\nc\u0393 \u2212 2\n\u2212 2\n2\u03c0\n\u01eb\n\u03bc\nwhere\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\u2212\u01eb \u0012 \u0013\u2212\u01eb\n\u2212\u01eb\ns12\n\u01eb2 \u03c0 2\ns12\ns12\n\u2261 Re \u2212 2\n+ O(\u01eb3 ).\n(119)\n=\n\u2212\n\u2212 2\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc2\n2\nIn order to obtain the counterterms we only need to perform a renormalization\ntransformation of the couplings, gh \u2192 Zgh gh , g\u0303h \u2192 Zegh g\u0303h . We use the MS scheme\nto define the renormalization constants in all rs.

(46), with the finite rs independent part given by MNS (g, g; h) = gh2 (Nc2 \u2212\n1) NF s212 /6. The scheme dependences also exemplify the formulas discussed in\nSection 4.3.\nTurning to the calculation of the real corrections, we also have to take into\naccount the processes with (anti)quarks in the initial state.

(127) and (128) are related by crossing.\nWe have now all the necessary matrix elements at hand to compute cross\nsections. In this example we restrict ourselves to the total cross section \u03c3.

In order to ensure this correct\ntreatment, one can subtract the collinear limit of the integrand in Eq.
