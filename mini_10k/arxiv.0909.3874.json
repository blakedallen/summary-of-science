As the effective Yang-Mills Lagrangian is\ncompletely determined by the quantum field theory, there is no adjustable parameter in the model except the energy scale. In\nthis model, the equation-of-state (EOS) of the YMC dark energy, wy > \u22121 and wy < \u22121, can both be naturally realized. By\nstudying the evolution of various components in the model, we find that, in the early stage of the universe, dark energy tracked\nthe evolution of the radiation, i.e. wy \u2192 1/3. However, in the late stage, wy naturally runs to the critical state with wy = \u22121,\nand the universe transits from matter-dominated into dark energy dominated stage only at recently z \u223c 0.3. These characters\nare independent of the choice of the initial condition, and the cosmic coincidence problem is avoided in the models. We also\nfind that, if the possible interaction between YMC and dust matter is considered, the late time attractor solution may exist.\nIn this case, the EOS of YMC must evolve from wy > 0 into wy < \u22121, which is slightly suggested by the observations. At the\nsame time, the total EOS in the attractor solution is wtot = \u22121, the universe being the de Sitter expansion in the late stage,\nand the cosmic big rip is naturally avoided. These features are all independent of the interacting forms.\nPACS numbers: 98.80.-k, 98.80.Es, 04.30.-w, 04.62.+v\n\n1\n\n\fI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe observations of Type Ia Supernova (SNIa) [1], together with the cosmic microwave background radiation\n(CMB)[2] and the larger scale structure [3], suggest that the present universe is accelerating expansion, which needs\na kind of mysterious dark energy with negative equation-of-state (EOS). The simplest model is by introducing the\ncosmological constant term \u039b, which has a constant effective EOS w = \u22121, and drive the acceleration of the universe.\nIf assuming the effective energy of the \u039b term occupies \u223c 73% of the total energy, together with \u223c 23% dark matter,\n\u223c 4% baryon matter and \u223c 10\u22125 radiation component, constitute the so-called \u039bCDM model.\nAlthough this simple model satisfies nearly all the cosmological observations, it still remains a phenomenological\nmodel. Since the major components, \u039b and dark matter, still keep unclear for us. For the \u039b as the candidate of dark\nenergy, also suffers from the following dilemmas (see for instant [4]): First, the effective energy density is quite tiny,\n\u03c1\u039b \u223c 5.8h2 \u00d7 10\u221211 eV4 . If we consider it as the vacuum energy of the particle physics, this energy density is 120 order\nsmaller than the Planck energy scale! This is the so-called 'fine-tunning' problem. Second, the density scale of \u039b\nkeeps constant in all the stage of the universe. The observations show that the present value of the matter component\n(including dark matter and baryon components) is some one third of \u03c1\u039b , but it varies with time as \u03c1m \u221d a\u22123 . So,\nfor example, at an earlier time of radiation-matter equality with redshift z \u223c 3454, \u03c1\u039b should be a very fine tuned\nvalue \u223c 6.3 \u00d7 10\u221211 \u03c1m . Otherwise, a slightly variant initial value of \u03c1\u039b would lead to a value of the ratio \u03c1\u039b /\u03c1m\ndrastically different from the observed one. This is the so-called 'coincidence' problem. In addition, the \u039bCDM model\nalso faces some observational challenges: there are mild evidences show that, the EOS of dark energy might evolve\nfrom w > \u22121 in the early stage to w < \u22121 in the current stage [5], which is expected to be confirmed by the future\nsensitive observations [6].\nSo, it is necessary to look for other candidates as the dark energy, especially the dynamical models. One possibility\nis proposing a canonical scalar field \u03c6 with the langrangian L\u03c6 = \u03c6\u03072 /2 \u2212 V (\u03c6), which is dubbed as the 'quintessence'\nmodels (see the review [7]). Similar to the inflationary field, when the potential term V (\u03c6) is dominant, the EOS of\nthe quintessence field approaches to \u22121, i.e. \u039b-like, and accounts for the observations. The most interesting is that,\nin [8], the authors introduced a kind of potential forms, such as V (\u03c6) = M 4+\u03b1 \u03c6\u2212\u03b1 or V (\u03c6) = M 4 [exp(Mpl /\u03c6) \u2212 1],\nwhich have the tracker solutions, i.e. the field \u03c6 tracked the evolution of the background components in the early\nuniverse. So they address the coincidence problem, i.e. removing the need to tune initial conditions in order for the\nmatter and dark energy densities to nearly coincide today. Although, this kind of models have been excluded by the\ncosmological observations, it provides the excellent possibility to naturally avoided the coincidence problems.\nHowever, the quintessence models also suffer from some dilemmas. The EOS of the quintessence models are in the\nrange \u22121 < w < 1. In order to obtain a EOS with w < \u22121, one always has to introduce the so-called 'phantom'\nfield, which includes the non-canonical negative kinetic terms [9][10]. However, the 'phantom' field lacks the strong\nphysical motivation, and also leads to the problem of quantum instabilities [11]. In [12], the authors also pointed\nthat, if w < \u22121 keeps, the universe shall face the 'big-rip' problem.\nIn addition to proposing the dynamical dark energy models, some efforts have been paid to modify the general\nrelativity (GR) [13], which can also speed-up the universe in the recent stage. However, it should be pointed that, any\nrevised GR should prepare to go through the strict solar system test [14], as well as to explain the various cosmological\nobservations, such as the CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies power spectra. In addition, to our view, the\ncurrent observations have not provided the strong reasons to answer: Why we should modify GR and how to modify\nit.\nIn this paper, we shall propose the Yang-Mills condensate (YMC) dark energy models, where, instead of the scalar\nfield, the quantum Yang-Mills field is considered as the candidate of dark energy component. Recently, the similar\nmodels are also discussed by a number of authors [15][16]. Different from the scalar field models, the Yang-Mills\nfields are the indispensable cornerstone to particle physics, gauge bosons have been observed. There is no room for\nadjusting the form of effective Yang-Mills Lagrangian as it is predicted by quantum corrections according to field\ntheory. In this review, we shall firstly introduce physical motivations of the YMC dark energy models in Section II.\nIn Section III, we simply introduce and discuss the Lagrangian of effective quantum Yang-Mills field.\nAs the main part of this paper, in Section IV, we apply the YMC into the cosmology as the candidate of dark\nenergy, and investigate the cosmic evolution of the various components, especially the evolution of dark energy. We\nfind the excellent characters of this kind of models. Different from the quintessence models, both the EOS wy > \u22121\nand wy < \u22121 can be naturally realized. In the free YMC dark energy models, wy \u2192 1/3 in the early stage and\ntracked the evolution of radiation component. Only in the recent stage, wy rolls to the critical state with wy = \u22121,\ni.e. \u039b-like, and accounts for the observations. This feature is independent of the choice of the initial condition, so\nthe coincidence problem is naturally avoided. We also find that, if the possible interaction between YMC and dust\ncomponents is considered, the late time attractor solution can exist, where the EOS of YMC naturally runs from\nwy \u2192 1/3 to the the phantom-like attractor state, i.e. wy < \u22121. However, the total effective EOS is wtot = \u22121 in the\nattractor solution, and the so-called 'big-rip' problem is also avoided. We should pointed that, these new features are\n2\n\n\fall independent of the interaction forms. In Section V, we calculate the statefinder and Omdiagnostics for the YMC\ndark energy models, which are helpful to differentiate the YMC models from the other dark energy models from the\nobservations.\nSection VI is contributed as a summary of this paper.\nThroughout this paper, we will work with unit in which c = ~ = kB = 1.\nII.\n\nPHYSICAL MOTIVATION\n\nThe introduction of the quantum effective YMC into cosmology [17] has been motivated by the fact that the\nSU (3) YMC has given a phenomenological description of the vacuum within hadrons confining quarks, and yet at\nthe same time all the important properties of a proper quantum field are kept, such as the Lorentz invariance, the\ngauge symmetry, and the correct trace anomaly [18] [19]. Quarks inside a hadron would experience the existence\nof the Bag constant, B, which is equivalent to an energy density B and a pressure \u2212B. So quarks would feel an\nenergy-momentum tensor of the vacuum as T\u03bc\u03bd = Bdiag(1, \u22121, \u22121, \u22121). This non-trivial vacuum has been formed\nmainly by the contributions from the quantum effective YMC, and from the possible interactions with quarks. Our\nthinking has been that if the vacuum inside a hadron is filled with the quantum effective YMC, what if the vacuum\nof the universe as a whole is also filled with some kind of YMC.\nGauge fields play a very important role in, and are the indispensable cornerstone to, particle physics. All known\nfundamental interactions between particles are mediated through gauge bosons. Generally speaking, as a gauge field,\nthe YMC under consideration may have interactions with other species of particles in the universe. However, unlike\nthose well known interactions in QED, QCD, and the electro-weak unification, here at the moment we do not yet\nhave a model for the details of the microscopic interactions between the YMC and other particle. Therefore, in this\npaper on the dark energy model based on the quantum effective YMC, we will adopt a simple description of the\npossible interactions between the YMC and other cosmic particles, in addition to the simplest model with free YMC\ncomponent. We will investigate in these models the cosmic evolution of the universe from the radiation-dominated\nera up to the present.\nIII.\n\nYANG-MILLS FIELD MODEL\n\nIn the effective YMC dark energy model, the effective Yang-Mills field Lagrangian is given by [18][20, 21]:\nLeff =\n\n\u0001\n1\nbF ln F/\u03ba2 \u2212 1 ,\n2\n\n(1)\n\na\nwhere \u03ba is the renormalization scale of dimension of squared mass, F \u2261 \u2212(1/2)F\u03bc\u03bd\nF a\u03bc\u03bd plays the role of the order\n2\nparameter of the YMC. The Callan-Symanzik coefficient b = (11N \u2212 2Nf )/24\u03c0 for SU (N ) with Nf being the number\nof quark flavors. For the gauge group SU (2) considered here, one has b = 11/12\u03c0 2 when the fermion's contribution\nis neglected. For the case of SU (3) the effective Lagrangian in (1) leads to a phenomenological description of the\nasymptotic freedom for quarks inside hadrons [18]. It should be noted that the SU (2) Yang-Mills field is introduced\nhere as a model for the cosmic dark energy, in may not be directly identified as the QCD fields, nor the weakelectromagnetic unification gauge fields.\nAn explanation can be given for the form in (1) as an effective Lagrangian up to 1-loop quantum correct [18, 19, 22].\nA classical SU (N ) Yang-Mills field Lagrangian is L = F/2g02 , where g0 is the bare coupling constant. As is known.\nwhen 1-loop quantum corrections are included, the bare coupling g0 will be replaced by a running one g as the following\n[23], g02 \u2192 g 2 = 2/(b ln(k 2 /k02 )), where k is the momentum transfer and k0 is the energy scale. To build up an effective\ntheory [18, 19, 22], one may just replace the momentum transfer k 2 by the field strength F in the following manner:\nln(k 2 /k02 ) \u2192 2 ln |F/e\u03ba2 |, yielding equation (1). We would like to point out that the renormalization scale \u03ba is the\nonly parameter of this effective Yang-Mills model, and its value should be determined by comparing the observations.\nIn contrast to the scalar field dark energy models, the YMC Lagrangian is completely fixed by quantum corrections\nup to 1-loops, and there is no room for adjusting its functional form. This is an attractive feature of the effective YMC\ndark energy model. We should mention that, the YMC dark energy models including 2-loop and 3-loop quantum\ncorrects are also discussed in the recent papers [24][25]. It was found that, these more complicated models have the\nexactly same characters with the 1-loop models. So in this paper, we mainly focus on the 1-loop models with the\nLagrangian in (1).\n\n3\n\n\fIV.\n\nYMC AS DARK ENERGY\n\nLet us work in the flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe, which is described by\nds2 = dt2 \u2212 a2 (t)\u03b4ij dxi dxj = a2 (\u03c4 )[d\u03c4 2 \u2212 \u03b4ij dxi dxj ],\nwhere t time and \u03c4 time are related by cdt = ad\u03c4 . Considering the simplest case with only the YMC in the universe,\nwhich minimally coupled to the gravity, the effective action is,\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n\u221a\nR\n(2)\n+ Leff d4 x.\n\u2212g \u2212\nS=\n16\u03c0G\nHere, g is the determinant of the metric g\u03bc\u03bd . R is the scalar Ricci curvature, and Leff is the effective Lagrangian\nof YMC, described by Eq. (1). By variation of S with respect to the metric g \u03bc\u03bd , one obtains the Einstein equation\nG\u03bc\u03bd = 8\u03c0GT\u03bc\u03bd , where the energy-momentum tensor of YMC is given by\nT\u03bc\u03bd =\n\n3\nX\ng\u03bc\u03bd a a\u03c3\u03b4\na\nF F\n+ \u01ebF\u03bc\u03c3\nF\u03bda\u03c3 .\n2 \u03c3\u03b4\n4g\na=1\n\n(3)\n\nThe dielectric constant is defined by \u01eb \u2261 2\u2202Leff /\u2202F . In the one-loop order, it is given by\n\u01eb = b ln F/\u03ba2 .\n\n(4)\n\nThis energy-momentum tensor (3) is the sum of three different energy-momentum tensors of the vectors, T\u03bc\u03bd =\nP (a)\nT\u03bc\u03bd , neither of which is of prefect-fluid form. Here we assume the gauge fields are only the functions of time\na\nt, and A\u03bc = 2i \u03c3a Aa\u03bc (t) (here \u03c3a are the Pauli's matrices) are given by A0 = 0 and Aai = \u03b4ia A(t). Thus, we will find\nthat, the total energy-momentum tensor T\u03bc\u03bd is homogeneous and isotropic.\nDefine the Yang-Mills field tensor as usual:\na\nF\u03bc\u03bd\n= \u2202\u03bc Aa\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd Aa\u03bc + f abc Ab\u03bc Ac\u03bd ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere f abc is the structure constant of gauge group and f abc = \u01ebabc for the SU (2) case. This tensor can be written\nin the form with the electric and magnetic field as\n\nF a\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\uf8f6\n0\nE1 E2 E3\nB3 \u2212B2 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \u2212E1 0\n=\uf8ed\n.\n\u2212E2 \u2212B3 0\nB1 \uf8f8\n\u2212E3 B2 \u2212B1 0\n\uf8eb\n\n(6)\n\nIt can be easily found that E12 = E22 = E32 , and B12 = B22 = B32 . Thus F has a simple form with F = E 2 \u2212 B 2 , where\nP3\nP3\nE 2 = i=1 Ei2 and B 2 = i=1 Bi2 . In this case, each component of the energy-momentum tensor is\n(a)\n\n1\n\u01eb\n(\u01eb \u2212 b)(B 2 \u2212 E 2 )\u03b4\u03bc0 + E 2 \u03b4\u03bc0 ,\n6\n3\n1\n\u01eb\n\u01eb\n= (\u01eb \u2212 b)(B 2 \u2212 E 2 )\u03b4ji + E 2 \u03b4ji \u03b4ja \u2212 B 2 \u03b4ji (1 \u2212 \u03b4ja ).\n6\n3\n3\n\nT\u03bc0 =\n\n(a)\n\nTji\n\n(7)\n(8)\n\nAlthough this tensor is not isotropic, its value along the j = a direction isP\ndifferent from the ones along the directions\n3\nperpendicular to it. However, the total energy-momentum tensor T\u03bc\u03bd = a=1 (a) T\u03bc\u03bd has isotropic stresses, and the\ncorresponding energy density and pressure are given by\n\u03c1y =\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\u01eb(E 2 + B 2 ) + b(E 2 \u2212 B 2 ), py = \u01eb(E 2 + B 2 ) \u2212 b(E 2 \u2212 B 2 ).\n2\n2\n6\n2\n\n(9)\n\nIn this paper, for simplicity, we only discuss the pure 'electric' case, F = E 2 . This is a typical consideration, since in\nthe expanding universe, a given 'magnetic' component of Yang-Mills field decreases quite rapidly, and the Yang-Mills\nfield becomes the 'electric' type [26]. The energy density and pressure of YMC are reduced to\n\u03c1y =\n\n\u0011\nE2 \u0010 \u01eb\nE2\n(\u01eb + b), py =\n\u2212b .\n2\n2 3\n4\n\n\fIt is convenient to introduce a dimensionless quantity y \u2261 \u01eb/b = ln |F/\u03ba2 |. So the quantities \u03c1y and py can be\nrewritten as\n\u03c1y =\n\n1\n1 2\nb\u03ba (y + 1)ey , py = b\u03ba2 (y \u2212 3)ey .\n2\n6\n\n(10)\n\nOne sees that, to ensure that energy density \u03c1y be positive in any physically viable model, the allowance for the\nquantity y should be y > \u22121, i.e. F > \u03ba2 /e \u2243 0.368\u03ba2. The EOS of the YMC is\nwy \u2261\n\npy\ny\u22123\n=\n.\n\u03c1y\n3y + 3\n\n(11)\n\nBefore setting up a cosmological model, the EOS wy itself as a function of F is interesting. At the state with F = \u03ba2 ,\nwhich is called critical point, one has y = 0 and the YMC has an EOS of the cosmological constant with wy = \u22121.\nAround this critical point, F < \u03ba2 gives y < 0 and w < \u22121, and F > \u03ba2 gives y > 0 and w > \u22121. So in the YMC\ndark energy models, EOS with w > \u22121 and w < \u22121 all can be naturally realized. On the other hand, in the high\nenergy scale with F \u226b \u03ba2 , one finds that the YMC exhibits an EOS of radiation with wy = 1/3. In the follows, we\nwill detailed show that the YMC was evolving from the state with wy = 1/3 to wy = \u22121 (or even to wy < \u22121) in\nthe expanding universe. This is the main context in this paper. In addition, the characteristic statefinder parameters\nand the perturbations of the YMC dark energy is also discussed in [27, 28][29], which are helpful to distinguish the\nYMC model from other dark energy models.\nAs is known, an effective theory is a simple representation for an interacting quantum system of many degrees of\nfreedom at and around its respective low energies. Commonly, it applies only in low energies. However, it is interesting\nto note that the YMC model as an effective theory intrinsically incorporates the appropriate states for both high and\nlow temperature. As has been shown, the same expression in (11) simultaneously gives py \u223c \u2212\u03c1y at low energies,\nand py \u2192 \u03c1y /3 at high energies. Therefore, the model of effective YMC can be used even at higher energies than the\nrenormalization scale \u03ba.\nA.\n\nFree YMC models\n\nLet us discuss the cosmological model, which filled with three kinds of major energy components, the dark energy, the\nmatter, including both baryons and dark matter, and the radiation. Here, the dark energy component is represented\nby YMC, and the matter component is simply described by a non-relativistic dust with negligible pressure, and the\nradiation component consists of the photons and possibly other particles, such as the neutrino, if they are massless.\nSince the universe is assumed to be flat, the sum of the fraction densities is \u03a9y + \u03a9m + \u03a9r = 1, where the fractional\nenergy densities are \u03a9y \u2261 \u03c1y /\u03c1tot , \u03a9m \u2261 \u03c1m /\u03c1tot , \u03a9r \u2261 \u03c1r /\u03c1tot , and the total energy density is \u03c1tot \u2261 \u03c1y + \u03c1m + \u03c1r .\nThe overall expansion of the universe is determined by the Friedmann equations:\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u0227\n8\u03c0G\n=\n(\u03c1y + \u03c1m + \u03c1r ),\n(12)\na\n3\n4\u03c0G\n\u00e4\n=\u2212\n(\u03c1y + 3py + \u03c1m + \u03c1r + 3\u03c1r ),\n(13)\na\n3\nwhere and what follows, the superscript dot denote the d/dt. These three components of energy contribute to the\nsource on the right-hand side of the equations. We should notice that, pr = \u03c1r /3. In this subsection, we shall\nassume there is no interaction between these three components. The dynamical evolutions of the three components\nare determined by their equations of motion, which can be written as equations of the conservation of energy,\n\u0227\n\u03c1\u0307y + 3 (\u03c1y + py ) = 0,\na\n\u0227\n\u03c1\u0307m + 3 \u03c1m = 0,\na\n\u0227\n\u03c1\u0307r + 3 (\u03c1r + pr ) = 0.\na\n\n(14)\n(15)\n(16)\n\nAs is known, Eq. (13) is not independent and can be derived from Eqs. (14), (15), (16) and (12). From Eqs. (15)\nand (16), we can obtain the evolutions of the matter and radiation components, \u03c1m \u221d a\u22123 and \u03c1m \u221d a\u22124 .\nNow, let us focus on the evolution of YMC.

At the early stages, a \u2192 0,\nEq. (17) leads to y \u226b 1, and Eq. (11) gives wy \u2192 1/3, so the YMC behaves as the radiation component. With\nthe expansion of the universe, the value of y runs to the critical state of y = 0, and the EOS goes to wy = \u22121. So,\nin the late stage of the universe, the YMC behaves as the cosmological constant. This is one of the most attractive\ncharacter of the YMC models. Around the critical point with y = 0, Eq.(17) yields y \u221d a\u22122 , and the EOS of YMC is\nwy + 1 \u2243 4y/3 \u221d a\u22122 . The YMC can achieve the states of wy > \u22121 and wy < \u22121, but it can not cross over \u22121, just\nlike in the scalar models [30].\nWe should notice that, the relation in (17) can also be derived by the effective Yang-Mills equations. By variation\nof the action S with respect to gauge field Aa\u03bc , we can obtain the Yang-Mills equations, which are\n\u2202\u03bc (a4 \u01eb F a\u03bc\u03bd ) + f abc Ab\u03bc (a4 \u01eb F c\u03bc\u03bd ) = 0.\n\n(18)\n\nThe \u03bd = 0 component of which is an identity, and the \u03bd = 1, 2, 3 spatial components can be reduced to \u2202\u03c4 (a2 \u01ebE) = 0.\nAt the critical point (\u01eb = 0), this equation is an identity. When \u01eb 6= 0, this equation has an exact solution as (17) [21].\nNow, let us fix the value of \u03ba, the only parameter in the model. At the present time, the YMC energy density is\n\u03c1y =\n\nbE 2\nb\u03ba2\n(y + 1) \u2243\n,\n2\n2\n\n(19)\n\nand, as the dark energy, it should be \u03a9y \u03c1tot , where the present total energy density in the universe \u03c1tot \u2248 8.099 h2 \u00d7\n10\u221211 eV4 . We choose \u03a9y = 0.73 as has been observed, yielding\n\u03ba = 3.57 h \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 .\n\n(20)\n\nThis energy scale is low compared to typical energy scales in particle physics, such as the QCD and the weakelectromagnetic unification. This is the reason, why the SU (2) Yang-Millls field introduced in this paper cannot be\ndirectly identified as the the QCD gluon fields, nor the weak-electromagnetic unification gauge fields.\nTo be more specific about how the YMC evolves in the expanding universe, we look at an early stage when the Big\nBang nucleosynthesis (BBN) processes occur around a redshift z \u223c 1010 with an energy scale \u223c 1MeV.

Right panel: The transition redshift zt\ndepends on the initial value rb . In both panels, the shadow region has been excluded by the observation of BBN.\n\nthe evolution of \u03c1y depends the the initial condition, we introduce the ratio of energies of the two components\nrb \u2261\n\n\u03c1y\n\u03c1r\n\n,\n\n(21)\n\nz=1010\n\nwhere \u03c1r is the radiation energy density. We consider rb < 1, i.e. the YMC is subdominant to the radiation component\ninitially. Of course, the YMC evolves differently for different initial values of rb . Nevertheless, we will see that, as the\nresult of evolution, the present universe is always dominated by the YMC \u03a9y \u223c 0.73 for a very wide range of initial\nvalues rb .\nNow we use the exact solution (17) to plot the evolution of \u03c1y as a function of the redshift z in Fig. 1 (left panel).\nAs specific examples, here we take rb = 10\u22122 , and rb = 10\u221220 . In comparison, also plotted are the energy densities\nof radiation, and of matter. It is seen that, in the early stages, \u03c1y decreases as \u03c1y \u221d a\u22124 . So the YMC density is\nsubdominant and tracks the radiation, a scaling solution. The corresponding EOS of Yang-Mills field is wy \u2243 1/3\nshown in Fig. 1 (right panel). At late stages, with the expansion of the universe, a \u2192 \u221e, y decreases to nearly zero,\nand wy \u2192 \u22121 asymptotically. Moreover, this asymptotic region is arrived at some redshift z before the present time,\nand this z has different values for different initial values of rb . For smaller rb , the transition redshift is larger (seen in\nFig. 1), and the transition happens earlier. Once the asymptotic region is achieved, the density of the YMC levels off\nand remain a constant forever, like a cosmological constant. We have also checked that the present value \u03a9y \u223c 0.73 is\nalso the outcome of the cosmic evolution for any value of rb in the very wide range (10\u221220 , 10\u22122 ). So the coincidence\nproblem do not exist in the YMC model.\nThe present EOS of the YMC w0 is nearly \u22121. Fig. 2 (left panel) plots the dependence of the present EOS w0 on\nthe initial condition rb . The function log10 (rb ) versus log10 (w0 + 1) is nearly linear: a smaller rb leads to a smaller\nw0 . For a value rb = 10\u22122 , one has w0 = \u22120.99. For a value rb = 10\u221220 , w0 would be \u22121 accurately up to one in\n1011 . Therefore, at present the YMC is very similar to the cosmological constant.\nThe solution in Eq.(17) can converted into the following form\n\u0015\n\u0014\nr\ny\ny \u2212 y0\n\u2212 1,\n(22)\nexp\nz=\ny0\n4\nwhere y0 is the value of y at z = 0, depending on the initial value rb . For a fixed y0 , this formula tells a one-one\nrelation between the EOS (through y) and the corresponding redshift z. As is seen from Fig. 1, the transition of \u03c9\n7\n\n\ffrom 1/3 to \u22121 occurs during a finite period of time, instead of instantly. To characterize the time of transition, we\nuse zt to denote the redshift when \u03c9 = \u22121/3, i.e. y = 1, as given by Eq.(11). This is, in fact, the time when the\nstrong energy condition begins to be violated, i.e., \u03c1y + 3py \u2264 0. Then\nr\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1 \u2212 y0\n1\n\u2212 1.\n(23)\nexp\nzt =\ny0\n4\nTherefore, this gives a function zt = zt (rb ). Fig. 2 (right panel) shows how the transition redshift zt depends on\nthe ratio rb . Interestingly, this transition can occur before, or after the radiation-matter equality (zeq = 3454). This\nfeature is different from the tracked quintessence models in which transition occurs during the matter dominated era\n[8]. A larger rb leads to a smaller zt . For example, rb = 10\u22122 leads to zt \u2243 12.4 \u226a zeq , and the transition occurs in\nthe matter dominated stage, and rb = 10\u221220 leads to zt \u2243 5.0 \u00d7 105 \u226b zeq , and the transition occurs in the radiation\ndominated stage.\nThe value of rb cannot be chosen to arbitrarily large. In fact, there is a constraint from the observation result\nof the BBN. As is known, the presence of dark energy during nucleosynthesis epoch will speedup the expansion,\nenhancing the effective species N\u03bd of neutrinos [31]. The latest analysis gives a constrain on the extra neutrino species\n\u03b4N\u03bd \u2261 N\u03bd \u2212 3 < 1.60 [31]. Here in our model, the dark energy is played by the YM field. By a similar analysis, the\n\u03bd /4\nratio rb is related to \u03b4N\u03bd through rb = 7\u03b4N\n10.75 . This leads to an upper limit rb < 0.26, the present EoS w0 < \u22120.94\nby Fig. 2 (left panel), and the transition redshift zt > 5.8 by Fig. 2 (right panel). The range of initial conditions\nrb \u2208 (10\u221220 , 10\u22122 ) that we have taken satisfies this constraint.\nB.\n\nCoupled YMC models\n\nIn this subsection, we shall generalize the original YMC dark energy model to include the interaction between the\nYMC and dust matter. We should mention that, the possible interaction between YMC and radiation component may\nalso exist, which has been discussed in [32]. (The similar models on the scalar field dark energy have been discussed\nby a number of authors (see [33] for instant)). In this section, we assume the YMC dark energy and background\nmatter interact through an interaction term Q. Thus the equations of the conservation of energy in (14) and (15)\nshould be changed into\n\u0227\n\u03c1\u0307y + 3 (\u03c1y + py ) = \u2212Q,\na\n\u0227\n\u03c1\u0307m + 3 \u03c1m = Q,\na\n\n(24)\n(25)\n\nand the equation for radiation in (16) is still held. The sum of Eqs. (24) and (25) guarantees that the total energy\nof YMC and dust matter is still conserved. It is worth noting that the free Yang-Mills equation in (18) is not\nsatisfied when Q 6= 0. In the natural unit, the interaction term Q has the dimension of [energy]5 . The coupling Q is\nphenomenological, and their specific forms will be addressed later. When Q > 0, the YMC transfers energy into the\nmatter, and this could be implemented, for instance, by the processes with the YMC decaying into pairs of matter\nparticles. On the other hand, when Q < 0, the matter transfers energy into the YMC. Note that, once Q is introduced\nas above, it will bring another new parameters in the models, in addition the free parameter \u03ba.\nWe introduce the following dimensionless variables, rescaled by the critical energy density b\u03ba2 /2 of the YMC,\nx\u2261\n\n2\u03c1m\n2Q\n, f\u2261 2 ,\nb\u03ba2\nb\u03ba H\n\n(26)\n\nwhere f is the function of x and y. By the help of the definition of y, the evolution equations (24) and (25) can be\nrewritten as a dynamical system, i.e.\n4y\nf (x, y)\n,\n\u2212\n2 + y (2 + y)ey\nx\u2032 = \u22123x + f (x, y).\ny\u2032 = \u2212\n\n(27)\n(28)\n\nHere, a prime denotes derivative with respect to the so-called e-folding time N \u2261 ln a. The fractional energy densities\nof dark energy and background matter are given by\n\u03a9y =\n\nx\n(1 + y)ey\n, and \u03a9m =\n.\n(1 + y)ey + x\n(1 + y)ey + x\n8\n\n(29)\n\n\fBefore discussing the specific form of the interaction term Q, let us first investigate the general feature of this\ndynamical system, described by (27) and (28). We can obtain the critical point (yc , xc ) of the autonomous system by\nimposing the conditions yc\u2032 = x\u2032c = 0. From the equations (27) and (28), we obtain that the critical state satisfies the\nfollowing simple relations\n3xc = f (xc , yc ),\n3xc = \u22124yceyc .\n\n(30)\n(31)\n\nSo we can obtain the critical state (yc , xc ) by solving these two equations. In order to study the stability of the critical\npoint, we substitute linear perturbations y \u2192 yc + \u03b4y and x \u2192 xc + \u03b4x about the critical point into dynamical system\nequations (27) and (28) and linearize them. Thus, two independent evolutive equations are derived,\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0012\n\u0012 \u2032\u0013\n\u03b4y\nG,y + R,y R,x\n\u03b4y\n\u03b4y\n,\n=\n\u2261\nM\n\u03b4x\nf,y\nf,x \u2212 3\n\u03b4x\n\u03b4x\u2032\nwhere R,y \u2261 \u2202R/\u2202y at (y, x) = (yc , xc ). The definitions of R,x , f,y , f,x and G,y are similar. The functions G and R\nare defined by\nG \u2261 G(y) = \u2212\n\n4y\n,\n2+y\n\nR \u2261 R(x, y) = \u2212\n\nf (x, y)\n,\n(2 + y)ey\n\nwhich are used for the simplification of the notation. The two eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix M determine\nthe stability of the corresponding critical point. The critical point is an attractor solution, which is stable, only if\nboth the these two eigenvalues are negative (stable node), or real parts of these two eigenvalues are negative and the\ndeterminant of the matrix M is negative (stable spiral).\nHere we discuss some general features of the attractor solutions, regardless the special form of the interaction term\nQ. From the expression (31), we find that xc = \u2212(4/3)yc eyc . Substitute this into the formula (29), one obtains\n\u03a9y =\n\n3 + 3yc\n(yc + 1)eyc\n=\n.\n(yc + 1)eyc + xc\n3 \u2212 yc\n\n(32)\n\nSince 0 \u2264 \u03a9y \u2264 1, this formula follows a constraint of the critical point\n\u2212 1 \u2264 yc \u2264 0.\n\n(33)\n\nFrom the formulae (11) and (32), we find a simple, but interesting relation,\n\u03a9y wy = \u22121.\n\n(34)\n\nThis relation is held for all attractor solutions, independent of the special form of the interaction. Since the value of\n\u03a9y is smaller than or equal to unity in the attractor solution, we obtain that\nwy \u2264 \u22121.\n\n(35)\n\nThis means that, the EOS of the YMC dark energy must be smaller than or equal to \u22121, i.e. phantom-like or \u039b-like.\nSince in the early universe, the value of the order parameter of the YM field F is much larger than that of \u03ba2 , i.e.\ny \u226b 1, the YM field is a kind of radiation component. However, in the late attractor solution, the dark energy\nis phantom-like or \u039b-like. So the phantom divide must be crossed in the former case, which is different from the\ninteracting quintessence models.\nIt is interesting to investigate the total EOS of the YMC and dust matter, which determines the finial fate of the\nuniverse, when the radiation becomes negligible. The total EOS is defined by\nwtot \u2261\n\nptot\npy + pm\n=\n= \u03a9y wy ,\n\u03c1tot\n\u03c1y + \u03c1m\n\n(36)\n\nwhere pm = 0 is used. From the relation (34), we obtain that, in the attractor solution,\nwtot = \u22121.\n\n(37)\n\nThis result is also independent of the specific form of the interaction. So the universe is an exact de Sitter expansion,\nand the cosmic big rip is naturally avoided, although the YMC dark energy can be phantom-like.\nNow, let us discuss the evolution of the various components in the universe for some specific interaction models.\nIn this paper, we shall focus on the following three phenomenological interaction models: Q \u221d H\u03c1y , Q \u221d H\u03c1m and\nQ \u221d H(\u03c1y + \u03c1m ), separately. Some other phenomenological models have also been discussed in the papers [32, 34].\n9\n\n\f1.\n\nQ \u221d H\u03c1y\n\nIn this case, we can write the function f (x, y) as the following form, f (x, y) = \u03b1(1 + y)ey . Of course, when \u03b1 = 0.\nthe system returns to the model with free YMC dark energy. Here, we consider the simplest case with \u03b1 being a\nnon-zero dimensionless constant. Thus, the dynamical equations in (27) and (28) becomes\n\u03b1(1 + y)\n4y\n\u2212\n,\n2+y\n(2 + y)\nx\u2032 = \u22123x + \u03b1(1 + y)ey .\ny\u2032 = \u2212\n\n(38)\n(39)\n\nObviously, the evolution of dust matter and YMC are influenced by the interaction by the function f (x, y). We\nexpect, when the fraction density of YMC was sub-dominant in the universe, the effect on the dust is small. Only in\nthe latest stage of the universe, where the YMC dark energy dominates the evolution of the universe, the effect of\ninteraction on the dust becomes important.\nThe critical point (yc , xc ) is obtained by imposing the condition yc\u2032 = x\u2032c = 0, which are\nyc = \u2212\n\n4yc yc\n\u03b1\n, xc = \u2212\ne ,\n4+\u03b1\n3\n\n(40)\n\nand the fractional energy density and the EOS of the YMC at this critical point are\n\u03a9y = \u2212\n\n3\n1\n=\n.\nwy\n\u03b1+3\n\n(41)\n\nThe constraint 0 \u2264 \u03a9y \u2264 1 requires that \u03b1 > 0 (note, we have set \u03b1 6= 0 throughout the discussion). In this condition,\nwe find that wy < \u22121 is satisfied. In order to keep this critical point being stable, i.e. (yc , xc ) is the attractor solution,\na constraint on \u03b1 can be derived: \u03b1 > \u22128, which is auto-satisfied when \u03b1 > 0 is required. So the attractor solution\nrequires that the constraint on the coefficient being\n\u03b1 > 0,\n\n(42)\n\nwhich follows that the EOS of YMC in this attractor solution must be negative. If we still require that, the fraction\ndensity of YMC is larger than the value at the present stage, i.e. \u03a9y > 0.73, the constraint on \u03b1 becomes much tighter\n0 < \u03b1 < 1.11.\nIn order to have a much clear picture for this system, let us study the evolution of the various components in the\nuniverse by adopting \u03b1 = 0.5. We still choose the initial condition at the BBN stage, i.e. z = 1010 , where the value\nof x is chosen as xi = 1.8 \u00d7 10\u221229 to keep the present value of \u03a9y being \u03a9y = 0.73. For the YMC, we consider the\nfollowing two choices as the initial condition: i.e. yi = 60 and yi = 20. In the former case, we have \u03a9yi /\u03a9mi = 0.16,\nand in the latter case, we have \u03a9yi /\u03a9mi = 3 \u00d7 10\u221219 . Although, the difference between these two \u03a9yi /\u03a9mi cases is\nlarger than 17 orders. we will show that, these two models follow the similar present state of universe.\nWe should also fix the value of \u03ba. In order to keep the present total energy density in the universe being \u03c1tot \u2243\n8.099h2 \u00d7 10\u221211 eV4 , we find the \u03ba = 4.00h \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 in both initial condiitons. If the Hubble constant h = 0.72 is\nadopted, we get \u03ba = 2.88 \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 . Again, we find the value of \u03ba is much smaller than the typical energy scale in\nthe particle physics.\nIn Fig. 3 (left panel), we plot the evolution of various components in the universe. Note that, the evolution line for\ndust component covered each other in both initial cases, as well as the radiation component. Similar to the free YMC\nmodels (shown in the left panel in Fig. 1), in the early stage of the universe, the YMC was tracking the radiation,\nand it transfered to the attractor solution in the later stage. The smaller yi induces the earlier transfer. In the right\npanel of Fig. 3, we plot the evolution of EOS of YMC wy and the total EOS wtot . Note that, the evolution line wtot\ncovered each other in both initial cases. As expected, in the both initial conditions, in the early stage, wy \u2192 1/3.\nIn the late stage, wy runs to the attractor solution with wy = \u2212(\u03b1 + 3)/3 with \u03b1 = 0.5, i.e. wy \u2192 \u22127/6. In the\nintermedial stage, the EOS wy must cross the line with wy = \u22121. For the total EOS wtot , in the early stage, wtot \u2192 0,\nwhere dust component is dominant than YMC. However, in the late stage, wtot \u2192 \u22121, which is consistent with the\nprevious discussions.\n\n10\n\n\f-5\n\n0.4\n\n-10\n-15\n\nra\nd\n\n)\n\ny\ni\n\n-45\n\n)\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.6\n\n(\n\ny\ni\n\n=\n2\n0\n\n-50\n\ni\n\nY\nM\nC\n\ner\n\n( y =20 )\n\n-40\n\n=\n6\n0\n\nEOS: w\n\n4\n\n( GeV\n\n(\n\n-35\n\nw\n-0.2\n\n-0.8\n\n)\n\ntot\n\nz = 0\n\n-30\n\nm\nat\nt\n\n0 )\ny =6\ni\nwy (\n\nY\nM\nC\n\n0.0\n\ny\n\n10\n\nn\n\n-25\n\nw\n\nlog\n\no\n\nz = 0\n\n-20\n\n0.2\n\nia\nti\n\nw = -1\n-1.0\n\n-55\n\n-1.2\n-60\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\nlog\n\n10\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n8\n\n( 1+ z )\n\n6\n\n4\n\nlog\n\n10\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n( 1+ z )\n\nFIG. 3: In the coupled YMC dark energy models, the evolution of the YMC energy density (left panels) and EOS (right panels)\nfor the models with different initial conditions.\n\n2.\n\nQ \u221d H\u03c1m\n\nNow, let us turn to the interaction cases with Q \u221d H\u03c1m , which is equivalent to the form f (x, y) = \u03b2x. The\ndynamical equations in (27) and (28) becomes\n\u03b2x\n4y\n,\n\u2212\n2 + y (2 + y)ey\nx\u2032 = (\u03b2 \u2212 3)x.\ny\u2032 = \u2212\n\n(43)\n(44)\n\nIf we consider the simplest, where \u03b2 is a constant, the equation (44) follows that x \u221d a\u03b2\u22123 . From the definition of x,\nwe derive that \u03c1m \u221d a\u03b2\u22123 . When \u03b2 = 0, the model returns to the free YMC cases, and \u03c1m \u221d a\u22123 as usual. However,\nwhen \u03b2 6= 0, the evolution of the dust component is changed, which is conflicted with the evolution of dust in the\nstandard hot big-bang model. So it is dangerous to consider this kind of interaction term in the early stage of the\nuniverse.\nHowever, it is allowed to consider the form of Q \u221d H\u03c1m as a kind of phenomenological model in the late stage of\nthe universe. The critical point (yc , xc ) of (43) and (44) is obtained by imposing the condition yc\u2032 = x\u2032c = 0, we find\nthese is no solution at all. So we conclude that, it is impossible to obtain an attractor solution for this kind of system.\n3.\n\nQ \u221d H(\u03c1y + \u03c1m )\n\nIn the end, let us discuss the another kind of phenomenological model, where Q \u221d H(\u03c1y + \u03c1m ) is satisfied. This is\nequivalent to set the form f (x, y) = \u03b3[(y +1)ey +x]. We consider the simplest case, where \u03b3 is a non-zero dimensionless\nconstant. In the dark energy dominant stage, this system returns to the first case with Q \u221d H\u03c1y , and in the dust\ndominant stage, it returns to the second case with Q \u221d H\u03c1m . Similar to the second case, if we directly apply this\nsystem to the early universe, the evolution of dust would be changed, which is conflicted with the prediction of the\nstandard hot big-bang models.\nIn this paper, we also consider this interaction form as a kind of phenomenological model in the late stage of the\n\n11\n\n\f0.4\n\nQ=0.5H\n\ny\n\n1.004\n\n1.004\n\n0.3\n\nSteady State Universe\n\nLCDM\n\nr\n\nr\n\nLCDM\n\nLCDM\n\n1.000\n\nQ=0.5H\n\nOm(z)\n\nQ=0\n\n1.000\n\nQ=0\n\ny\n\n0.2\n\n0.996\n\n0.996\n\nQ=0.5H\n0.1\n\ny\n\nQ=0\n0.992\n\nCircles denote the current values\n\nCircles denote the current values\n\n0.992\n\n0.0\n-0.4\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n-1.2\n\n-0.8\n\n-0.4\n\n0.0\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\n0.0\n\nq\n\ns\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\nz\n\nFIG. 4: Left panel: The r \u2212 s diagram of the YMC models; Middle panel: The r \u2212 q diagram of the YMC models; The right\npanel: Om(z) diagnostic in the YMC models.\n\nuniverse.

In the previous works [35][36], the authors suggested to use the so-called \"statefinder\" {r, s} pair and Om\n12\n\n\fdiagnostics. Here, we shall also apply the statefinder diagnosis into the YMC models. The similar discussion can be\nfound in the previous works [27][25][28][37].\nThe statefinder diagnostic pair {r, s} is defined as\n...\na\nr\u22121\nr\u2261\n, s\u2261\n,\n(50)\naH 3\n3(q \u2212 1/2)\nwhere q = \u2212\u00e4/(aH 2 ) is the deceleration parameters. r forms the next step in the hierarchy of geometrical cosmological\nparameters beyond H and q, and s is a linear combination of r and q. Apparently, the statefinder parameters depends\nonly on scale factor a and its derivatives, and thus it is a geometrical diagnostic. These parameters can also been\nexpressed in terms of \u03c1tot and ptot as follows\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c1tot + ptot \u1e57tot\n3ptot\n9(\u03c1tot + ptot )\u1e57tot\n1\n, s=\n.\n(51)\n1+\n, r =1+\nq=\n2\n\u03c1tot\n2\u03c1\u0307tot ptot\nptot\n\u03c1\u0307tot\nBy using Eqs. (24) and (25), we plot the trajectories of (r, s) and of (r, q) in Fig. 4 from the redshift z = 10, where\nwe have considered two cases with Q = 0 and Q = 0.5H\u03c1y . The arrows along the curves indicate the direction of\nevolution. In both cases, we have chosen the initial condition at the redshift z = 3454, where the densities of matter\nand radiation equate to each other. We choose the initial condition to make the \u03a9y = 0.01 at this high redshift.\nFrom this figure, we find that, the model with different interaction terms have the difference in both (r, s) and (r, q)\ntrajectories. However, in the low redshift (z < 10), especially when z \u223c 0, the trajectories in both models become\nquite close to those of the \u039bCDM model. However, we should also mention that, the trajectories of the statefinder\nshows in this figure are quite different from the other dark energy models, such as the decaying vacuum model, the\nQuintessence models, the K-essence models (see for instant [37] ). In order to break the degeneracy between the YMC\nmodels and the \u039bCDM models, let us consider the Om diagnostic, which is defined as\nOm(x) =\n\nh2 (x) \u2212 1\n,\nx3 \u2212 1\n\n(52)\n\nwhere x \u2261 (1 + z), and h(x) \u2261 H(x)/H0 . Thus Om involves only the first derivative of the scale factor through the\nHubble parameter and is easier to reconstruct from the observational data. For the \u039bCDM model, it is simple, i.e.\nOm(x) = \u03a9m , independent of the redshift. For YMC model, we plot Om as a function of z in the Fig.4 (right panel).\nIt is interesting to find that, for either model, Om is nearly a constant at the low redshift. For the model without\ninteraction, as expected, Om \u2243 0.27, very close to that of \u039bCDM models. However, for the model with Q = 0.5H\u03c1y ,\nOm = 0.15, which is helpful to differentiate the coupled YMC models from the \u039bCDM model.\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn order to answer the observed accelerating expansion of the universe in the present stage, we introduce the quantum\nYang-Mills condensate dark energy models. Different from the general scalar field models, the quantum Yang-Mills\nfields are the indispensable cornerstone to particles, and the Lagrangian of the Yang-Mills field is predicted by quantum\ncorrections according to field theory.\nIn this paper, we review the main characters of the YMC dark energy models, where both free YMC model and\npossible coupled YMC models are considered. In all these models, the EOS of YMC is close to wy = 1/3 in the early\nstage, and tracked the evolution of radiation components. In the late stage, the value of wy runs to the attractor\nsolution with wy = \u22121 for the free YMC model, or with wy < \u22121 for the coupled YMC models. This naturally\nexplains the observations. The present state of the universe is independent of the initial state of Yang-Mills field,\nand the coincidence problem is naturally avoided. In the coupled YMC models, not only the state of wy < \u22121 can\nbe naturally realized, mildly suggested by observations, but also the 'big-rip' problem is auto-avoided. The most\nimportance we should mention is that, as a dynamic dark energy model motivated by quantum effective YM field\nLagrangian, all the YM models based upon 1-loop, 2-loop, and 3-loop quantum corrections, respectively, have similar\ndynamic behaviors. That is, the main properties of YM model for dark energy remain stable when the number of\nloops for quantum corrections increases up to 3-loop.\nHowever, in all the models, the fine-tunning problem still exists, i.e. the value of \u03ba \u223c 10\u22125 eV2 , which is too low\ncomparing with the typical scales in particle physics. We should notice that, this problem exists in nearly all the dark\n\n13\n\n\fenergy models, which may suggest a new physics at this low energy scale.\n\n[1] M. Kowalski, et al. (2008).
