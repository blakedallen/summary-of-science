So-called hybrid mesons (qq\nstates with excited gluonic degree of freedom) and glueballs (purely gluonic states without\nvalence quarks) are allowed within Quantum Chromodynamics due to the self-coupling\nof gluons via the colour-charge, while they are forbidden within the CQM. Even though\nglueball candidates have been reported by the Crystal Barrel and the WA102 experiments,\nthe mixing with ordinary isoscalar mesons makes the interpretation difficult. Several light\nhybrids on the other hand are predicted to have exotic J PC quantum numbers and are thus\npromising candidates in the search for resonances beyond the CQM. The hybrid candidate\nlowest in mass is predicted [3] to have a mass between 1.3 and 2.2 GeV/c2 and exotic\nquantum numbers J PC = 1\u2212+ , not attainable by ordinary qq states.

In particular, the resonant nature of the \u03c01 (1600) observed by\nboth E852 and VES in the \u03c1\u03c0 decay channel [5, 6] in 3\u03c0 final states is questioned. In later\npublications, certain conclusions were withdrawn [7] and re-analyses of the (3\u03c0 )\u2212 system\nin two different final states within the same collaboration lead to opposite conclusions [8],\nrespectively. One may get a hint at this controversy looking at [9].\nAfter a short pilot run in 2004 (190 GeV/c \u03c0 \u2212 beam, Pb target), we recorded high statistics\nusing a 190 GeV/c negative pion beam scattered off a liquid hydrogen (proton) target. A\nsimilar amount of data with 190 GeV/c positive hadron beams has been taken in 2009,\nas well as some data (negative beam) with nuclear targets. As a first input to the puzzle,\nCOMPASS observed a significant J PC spin-exotic signal in the 2004 data (in three charged\npion final states) consistent with the disputed \u03c01 (1600) that was accepted for publication\nlast year [10]. The proton and nuclear target data taken in 2008/09 will enable COMPASS\nto further clarify the situation.\n\n2\n\nNew results of \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 in comparison to \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 final states\n\nThe invariant mass of the (3 \u03c0 )\u2212 system is shown for the neutral and the charged \u03c1\u03c0 decay\nmodes in Fig. 1. About half of the 2008 data with negative pion beam of 190 GeV/c have been\nanalysed so far in the high momentum transfer t0 region of 0.1 GeV2 /c2 < t0 < 1.0 GeV2 /c2 .\nDue to the different detection efficiencies obtained for neutral and charged particles, this\ntranslates to \u223c1 M events (neutral mode) and \u223c24 M event (charged mode), respectively,\nbeing roughly in the range as expected in general.\nThe new mass-independent PWA results for neutral and charged mode data presented in\n2\n\n\f20\n18\n\nIG J PC M\u2208 = 1-(2++)1+ rho pi D\n\nCOMPASS 2008\n\n38% of 2008 data\nnot acceptance corrected\n\n\u2022 \u03c0-\u03c0+\u03c0-\n\n\u03c0- + p \u2192 (3\u03c0)- + p\n\nmass indep.

For discussion see text.\n\nthis paper, are normalised using the a2 (1320) as a standard candle as shown in Fig. 2 (top,\nleft) in order to compensate for the different detection efficiencies. This makes the fitted\nintensities for individual partial waves comparable between neutral and charged modes.\nWith respect to [11], the wave-set has been extended from 42 to 53 waves, cf. also [12]\ngiving further details on the analysis of the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 final states likewise, and the data\nanalysed for the neutral mode has been increased by about a factor of five, allowing for\na first conclusive comparison also for small waves. A detailed description of the applied\nPWA method can be found in [11, 12] and references therein.\nEven though the neutral mode data have not yet been corrected for acceptance (which\nis rather flat for the charged mode), our data is in good agreement with expectations\nfrom isospin coupling considerations. If an isospin 1 resonance decays into \u03c1\u03c0, similar\nintensities are expected for neutral and charged mode, whereas decays into f 2 \u03c0 should\nshow a suppression factor of two for the neutral w.r.t. to the charged mode data, simply\ndue to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients determining the different isospin coupling for the\ndifferent underlying isobar structure, i.e. decays into an isovector versus an isoscalar. This\nis shown for some exemplary main and small waves in Fig. 2.

That our data follows the expectation from isospin symmetry to a\nlarge extent throughout the whole wave-set is shown by Fig. 3, depicting the intensity sums\nof all \u03c1\u03c0 and f 2 \u03c0 partial waves, respectively.\nThis simple isospin-symmetry holds only presumed the branchings are entirely determined\nby the isospin Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which is not true in general for f 0,2 \u03c0 decays, as\nBose-Symmetrisation with the other \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c0 0 , respectively, is required and might change\nthe observed ratio of intensities due to interference effects. There is no such effect, however,\nfor \u03c1\u03c0 decays since whatever the effect might be, it is the same for both decay modes, and\ntherefore cancels out. We checked by calculation using the wave function, that there is\nno such effect for \u03c02 (1670) decaying into f 2 \u03c0, for which the pure suppression factor of\ntwo is indeed expected, as given in Table 1. Depending on the overlap of the isobars on\nthe Dalitz plot, interference effects might change the factor of two, as for example in case\nof the \u03c0 (1800) decay into f 0 (980)\u03c0, for which we expect to find an enlarged suppression\nfactor (Tab. 1) in good agreement with our data, see Fig. 4 (top, centre).

The\nwell-known a2 (1320) resonance as well as the smaller, less prominent ones show a clean,\nrapid phase motion relatively to the a1 (1260). Not only the intensities but also the phases\nare consistent for both, neutral and charged mode, for discussion see text.\n\nintensities it is conclusive to look at the phase difference of a possible resonance with\nrespect to a well-know one. If the candidate is indeed a resonance, connected with the\nreference one (but not phase-locked), it should manifest in a clean phase motion between\nthem, as it is shown for main and small waves in Fig. 4, using the prominent a1 (1260)\nas reference. For the a2 (1320), we find a rapid phase motion just in the range between\nthe maxima of both objects, consistently coinciding for the neutral and the charged mode\ndata. For the \u03c02 (1670) and the a4 (2040), we observe a clean, rapid phase motion as well,\nagain consistently coinciding for both modes. As they are more separated in mass from the\nreference, they are resonating against the tail of the a1 (1260) resulting in observed phase\nmotions limited to the mass range (about 1.7-1.9 and 1.7-2.0 GeV/c2 , respectively) of the\ngiven resonance under study.\n\n5\n\n\fXIV International Conference on Hadron Spectroscopy (hadron2011), 13-17 June 2011, Munich, Germany\n\n3\n\nConclusions & summary\n\nThe hadron data taken in 2008/09 will allow COMPASS to contribute solving the puzzle\nof light spin-exotic mesons. The high statistics and the possibility of detecting final states\ninvolving neutral particles allows for simultaneous observation and confirmation of new\nstates in different final states by the same experiment. The new results presented on the\n\u03c1\u03c0 decay channel in both, neutral and charged decay modes of the (3\u03c0 )\u2212 system, appear\nvery consistent and solid not only for main but also for small waves. There is presently no\ncontradiction between both analysis results. In particular the coinciding relative phases of\nvarious resonances confirm already now the excellent potential to conclude on the existence\nof the spin-exotic \u03c01 (1600) resonance in the \u03c1\u03c0 decay channel, simultaneously observed in\ntwo different final states with the same experiment.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis work is supported by the BMBF (Germany), especially via the \"Nutzungsinitiative\nCERN\".\n\nReferences\n[1] R.
