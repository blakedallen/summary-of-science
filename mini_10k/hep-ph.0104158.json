Since the gauge theory\nbehaves at large distances as a 4 + \u03b4-dimensional and thus the topology of the infinity\nis that of of S 3+\u03b4 rather than S 3 , the set of gauge mappings are homotopically trivial\nand the CP-violating \u03b8-term vanishes on the brane world-volume. As well there are no\ncontributions to the \u03b8-term from the higher-dimensional solitonic configurations. In this\nway, the strong CP problem is absent in the models with quasi-localized gluons.\n\n\fDespite the fact that the Standard Model (SM) of elementary particles and their interactions is extremely successful in describing almost all currently available experimental\ndata, there are some puzzling theoretical points which force to think that a certain more\nfundamental physics stay behind the SM. One of such puzzles is the strong CP problem.\nIt is reflected in the appearance of CP-violating \u03b8-term in the effective Lagrangian of\nQCD [1]:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03b8\na e a\u03bc\u03bd\nL\u03b8 =\nT\nr\nG\nG\n,\n(1)\n\u03bc\u03bd\n32\u03c0 2\nea\u03bc\u03bd = 1 \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 Ga are gluon field strength and its dual, respectively.

Although (1) can be expressed as a full derivative\nit nevertheless does not vanishe at infinity because of the presence of topologically nontrivial instanton gauge field configurations [2]. Instantons, being stable, finite action\nsolutions to the Euclidean (non-Abelian) gauge field equations of motion, are interpreted\nphysically as a quantum-mechanical tunnellings between the different vacuum states |n >\nwhich are characterized by a topological index n \u2208 Z [3]. The true vacuum of the theory\nis a superposition of these vacuum states:\n|\u03b8 > =\n\nn=\u221e\nX\n\nein\u03b8 |n > .\n\n(2)\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\nThe stability of the instantonic configurations is guaranteed by the non-trivial topology.\nIndeed, any vacuum configuration of a vector field A\u03bc corresponding to the gauge group\nG has the form A\u03bc = U \u22121 \u2202\u03bc U, where U is an element of G. Actually, U defines a map\nfrom the geometry of a spatial infinity I to a gauge group G:\nU : I \u2192 G.\n\n(3)\n\nIn four dimensions I is isomorphic to a 3-sphere S 3 and if G is a gauge group which contains\nan SU(2) as a subgroup, the mapping (3) fall into the homotopically non-equivalent\nclasses each characterized by the topological winding number n \u2208 \u03c03 (SU(2)) = Z. The\nconservation of the topological charge prevents the instantons from decaying into the\ntrivial vacuum configuration. This is actually the case for the colour SU(3) group of QCD.\nThus, the strong CP problem emerges due to the existence of the |n > -vacua structure in\nQCD and due to the non-vanishing amplitude of tunnelling between different |n >-vacua.\nConsequently, the solution to the strong CP problem can be achieved either by suppressing\nthe tunnelling or making the |n > -vacua unstable. Most of the existing solutions to the\nc, where M\nc is\nMore precisely, this bound applies to the effective \u03b8-term defined as \u03b8 = \u03b8 + agr det M\nthe quark mass matrix.\n1\n\n1\n\n\fstrong CP problem rely on the first possibility. Perhaps the most elegant among them\nis the familiar Peccei-Quinn mechanism [4] which actually forbids tunnellings due to an\nextra anomalous U(1)P Q setting \u03b8 = 0 dynamically. To realize the second possibility one\nshould change the global geometry of space-time in such a way that mapping (3) becomes\nhomotopically trivial. In this letter we discuss such a possibility in a particular model\nwith extra dimensions2 .\nOne can find plenty of purely phenomenomenological motivations why the extra dimensions beyond those four observed so far could actually be present in nature. Moreover,\na consistent unification of all fundamental forces within the string theory seems also to\nrequire introduction of extra dimensions. Recently, the idea of extra dimensions received\na new twist after the observation that their effects might be accessible to probe in experiments in the near future, providing the size of extra dimensions are large enough\n(.TeV\u22121 ) [6, 7] or the extra space is warped [8, 9]. The common ingredient of all these\ntheoretical constructions, often called as a Brane World scenario, is a (3+1)-dimensional\nhypersurface (3-brane) embedded in higher dimensional space-time, where the SM fields\n[6] and perhaps gravity as well [8] are confined. Thus the crucial theoretical question is\nhow the fields of various spin are localized on a 3-brane (for earlier works see, e.g. [10]).\nThere are significant difficulties in localizing massless higher-spin fields, and in particular\ngauge fields, on a 3-brane [10]. In this respect the approach proposed in a series of recent\npapers [11, 12] is very attractive since it can be universally applied to all kind of fields.\nThe basic idea behind this approach is rather transparent [11, 12]. Consider some\nfield freely propagating in the higher-dimensional space-time (bulk) and having the coupling with another field which is localized on the 3-brane. In most general situations one\ncan expect that the radiative corrections with localized field running in the loops can\ninduce the non-trivial terms (including the kinetic one) for the bulk field on the 3-brane\nworld-volume. Then the emerging physical picture for the bulk field is the following: At\nsmall distances measured on the 3-brane world-volume the induced 4-dimensional kinetic\nterm dominates over the higher-dimensional one and the bulk field essentially behaves as\na 4-dimensional one. At large distances, however, the original higher-dimensional kinetic\nterm becomes dominant and the field behaves as a higher-dimensional. The crossover\nscale is actually controlled by the ratio of the parameters in the original kinetic term and\nin that of the induced one (that is the ratio of higher-dimensional and induced gauge\ncouplings in the case of gauge fields, for example) and should be adjusted in order not to\ncontradict the already known experimental data. This quasi-localization mechanism has\nbeen successfully applied to the gravity [11] and gauge interactions [12] and, as we mentioned above, can be used for other fields (fermions and bosons) as well. The remarkable\nthing offered by this mechanism is that the extra space-time now can be truly infinite,\nunlike the case of the ordinary Kaluza-Klein or warped compactification. This fact can\nbe further explored as a crucial standpoint for the solution of the cosmological constant\nproblem [11]. Here we would like to point out another feature of the above scenario with\n2\n\nFor an earlier proposal within a different model see [5].\n\n2\n\n\fquasi-localized gauge fields which concerns the strong CP problem. The idea is due to the\nabove-mentioned observation that the existence of the \u03b8-term (1) is essentially related to\nthe global geometry of space-time. In particular, since the gauge theory in the scenario of\nref. [12] become (4 + \u03b4)-dimensional at large distances and the topology of spatial infinity\nis that of S 3+\u03b4 rather than S 3 , the set of gauge mappings (3) become homotopically trivial\nand the \u03b8-term (1) disappears from the 3-brane world-volume.\nTo be more quantitative let us begin by considering a pure SU(2) gauge theory which\nlives in the 5-dimensional bulk. It is defined by the covariant derivative DM = \u2202M +\niAaM \u03c3 a /2 with field strengths GM N = GaM N \u03c3 a /2 = \u2212i [DM , DN ], where the capital letters\nrun over the bulk coordinates, M(N) = (\u03bc(\u03bd) = 0, 1, 2, 3; y), while those of small, a, b =\n1, 2, 3 are SU(2)-adjoint indices and \u03c3 a are the Pauli matrices. We assume also that\na (3+1)-dimensional \u03b4-like brane is embedded in 5-dimensional bulk space-time with a\ncertain matter fields charged under the SU(2) symmetry are localized on it. Then the\nradiative corrections involving these matter fields induce the (3+1)-dimensional kinetic\nterm for the SU(2) gauge field on the 3-brane world-volume, so that the total effective\nLagrangian can be written as:\nL=\u2212\n\n1\n\u03b4(y)\nG GM N \u2212\nG\u03bc\u03bd G\u03bc\u03bd + ...,\n2 MN\n2g5\n2g42\n\n(4)\n\nwhere g5 is the 5-dimensional gauge coupling with mass dimension -1/2 and g4 is the\ndimensionless 4-dimensional gauge coupling and G\u03bc\u03bd (x\u03bc ) = GM N (x\u03bc , y = 0)\u03b4\u03bcM \u03b4\u03bdN . Following [12], we define the crossover scale rc as:\nrc =\n\ng52\n,\n2g42\n\n(5)\n\nwhich need not be extremely large, i.e. of the order of the present Hubble size, as it could\nbe naively expected, but even rc \u223c 1015 cm (the solar system size) can be compatible with\nthe existing observations due to the phenomenon of infrared transparency (see [12] for\nmore details).\nLet us first consider two limiting cases: rc \u2192 0 and rc \u2192 \u221e. When rc \u2192 0 (g4 \u2192 \u221e,\ng5 = const), the induced kinetic term in (4) is completely irrelevant and thus the SU(2)\ngauge theory behaves as an exactly 5-dimensional one. Let us split coordinates as xM =\n(x0 , x\u03b1 ), where x\u03b1 = (xi , y) and i = 1, 2, 3 runs over the spatial 3-brane world-volume\ncoordinates. Now, we can use the well-known fact of formal mathematical equivalence\nbetween the static solitons in D spatial dimensions and the instantons in D \u2212 1 space\nand one imaginary-time dimensions. So, to construct the static solitonic solutions in 5\ndimensions we must just change the imaginary time coordinate x\ne0 = ix0 in the original\ninstanton configuration of the Euclidean 4-dimensional theory by the fifth coordinate y.\nThus, the soliton in five dimensions can be written in the form:\nA0 = 0,\nA\u03b1 = \u2212\n\ni\n\u03b7a\u03b1\u03b2 \u03c3 a \u2202\u03b2 ln U,\ng5\n3\n\n(6)\n\n\fwhere\nU(x\u03b1 ) = \u03c12 + \u03bb2 ,\n\n(7)\n\n2\n\n\u03c12 = (xi \u2212 \u03be i ) + (y \u2212 \u03be y )2 , \u03bb is the size of the soliton and \u03b7a\u03b1\u03b2 is the 't Hooft symbol:\n\u03b7a\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03b4a\u03b1 \u03b4y\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b4a\u03b2 \u03b4y\u03b1 + \u01eba\u03b1\u03b2\n\n(8)\n\nThe above configuration describes a static topologically stable soliton centered at x\u03b1 = \u03be \u03b1\nwith energy E = 8\u03c0 2 /g52 and thus represents the nontrivial homotopy \u03c03 (SU(2)) (just\nlike the instanton in four dimensions). The configuration (6),(7) satisfy the self-duality\nequation of the form\ne0\u03b1\u03b2 = G\u03b1\u03b2 ,\nG\n(9)\n\neABC = \u01ebABCDE GDE . The topological charge q is determined through the 4-volume\nwhere G\nintegral over the time component of the conserved current\ng52\neABC GBC\nT rG\n16\u03c0 2\n\nQA =\nwhich for (6),(7) is equal to one:\nq=\n\nZ Y\n3\n\ndxi dyQ0 =\n\ni=1\n\ng52\nE = 1.\n8\u03c0\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\nIn the opposite extreme case, i.e. when rc \u2192 \u221e (g5 \u2192 \u221e, g4 = const), the first\nterm in (4) disappears and theory becomes (3+1)-dimensional. Passing to the Euclidean\ncoordinates (x0 \u2192 ix0 ) we come back to the ordinary instanton configuration located on\nthe 3-brane world-volume at y = 0 by changing y to x0 in (6),(7) with Aay = 0 instead of\nAa0 = 0 and \u03bc = 0, 1, 2, 3 instead of \u03b1 = 1, 2, 3, y.\nIn the case of finite non-zero rc the gauge fields behave as (3+1)-dimensional at distances |xi | \u226a rc and as (4+1)-dimensional at large distances |xi | \u226b rc . Hence, the spatial\ninfinity is a 4-sphere S 4 rather than S 3 . Because of this, the (3+1)-dimensional instanton\nis not stable against dispersion since the gauge mappings S 4 \u2192 SU(2) is trivial. That is to\nsay, the boundary behavior of SU(2) gauge bosons can be always continuously deformed\nto the global (trivial) vacuum configuration while keeping the action finite and therefore\nthe instantons decay into this vacuum. Thus all the gauge freedom can be removed by\ngauge fixing and |n >-vacua and the \u03b8-term, consequently, do not arise.\nThe case of the soliton solution (6),(7) is somewhat different. In the case of finite\nrc the boundary conditions on the 3-brane located at y = 0 become relevant. Since the\ntranslational invariance along the fifth coordinate is broken by the presence of a 3-brane,\nthe Neumann boundary condition,\n\u2202A\u03bc\n\u2202y\n\n= 0,\ny=0\n\n4\n\n(12)\n\n\fis satisfied by the one-solitonic configuration (6),(7) only when \u03be y = 0. One can also\nconstruct the multiinstanton-like solitonic solution with\n\u0010 \u03bb2\n\u0011\n\u00012\n\u03bb2\nU = 2 + 2 +1\n\u03c12\u00b1 = xi + (y \u2213 \u03be)2\n(13)\n\u03c1+ \u03c1\u2212\nin (6) instead of (7) (see also [13]). This solution describes the static soliton centered\nat (0, 0, 0, 0, \u03be) and its image at (0, 0, 0, 0, \u2212\u03be) and also satisfies the boundary condition\n(12). Now, if the fermionic matter (quarks) are localized on the 3-brane, the \u03b8-term on\nthe brane will have the form:\nZ\n\u03b8\nL\u03b8 =\ndy\u03b4(y)Qy .\n(14)\n2rc\nIt is easy to see that the above solitonic configurations indeed lead to the vanishing of\n(14) simply because of Qy = 0.\nLet us stress that the absence of \u03b8-term is a feature of the particular models with\nquasi-localized gauge fields of ref. [12]. Nothing similar happen in more conventional\nmodels with compactified dimensions where the space-time geometry is a direct product\nof M 4 \u00d7 C N (M 4 is a 4-dimensional Minkowski space-time and C N is an N-dimensional\ncompactified internal space). Here we have actually two mappings: S 3 \u2192 SU(2) and\nB \u2192 SU(2), where S 3 is a boundary of a Euclideainized M 4 while B is a boundary\nof C N . In fact both mappings might be non-trivial. Thus at least instantons (and \u03b8term, consequently) will remain in M 4 although there might exist other stable topological\ndefects depending on the geometry of extra space-time C N [14].\nTo conclude, we showed that the QCD vacuum is indeed trivial in a certain class of\nBrane World models with quasi-localized gluons and thus CP-violating \u03b8-term is absent.\nHowever, in solving the strong CP problem in this way, we are loosing the instantonic\n\u2032\nsolution to the U(1)A problem (i.e. the origin of the \u03b7 mass). On the other hand, in\nthe naive quark model there is a simple and natural explanation of the fact why the\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03b7 is much heavier than the pion [15]: in the \u03b7 , which is an isosinglet, the quark antiquark pair can annihilate into gluons while such an annihilation is absent for the\nisovector \u03c0's. Moreover, as it was argued by Witten and Veneziano [16] long ago the\n\u2032\ninstantonic dynamics underlying \u03b7 mass is in conflict with predictions based on the large\n\u2032\nNc expansion. They have suggested that the true dynamical origin of the \u03b7 mass would\nbe the coupling of the U(1)A axial anomaly to the topological charge associated with\nconfinement-related vacuum fluctuations rather than instantons. Alternatively, it seems\npromising to look for intrinsically higher-dimensional solution of the U(1)A problem within\nthe models of quasi-localized gauge fields.\nAcknowledgement.
