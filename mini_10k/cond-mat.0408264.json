We numerically investigate the epidemic spreading on the network with a variety of\ncorrelations: the assortative, uncorrelated, and disassortative mixings. In a simulation for the meanfield-like susceptible-infected-recovered model, we observe different epidemic behavior according to\nthe types of correlations particularly in a directed network. Our results suggest that the assortative\nconnections between nodes with similar degrees enhance the epidemic spreading more significantly\nthan the uncorrelated and disassortative connections between cooperative nodes with high and low\ndegrees.\nPACS numbers: 87.23.Ge, 89.20.-a, 89.75.Hc, 05.10.-a\n\nSelf-organized complex networks have attracted a great\nattention to statistical physicists, computer scientists,\nand mathematical biologists, since many empirical studies have revealed the fact that a structure is commonly\nfound in social, technological, and biological networks.\nThe structure is called scale-free (SF) [2] and follows a\npower-law distribution P (k) \u223c k \u2212\u03b3 , 2 < \u03b3 < 3, for the\nnumber of nodes with degree k. Since the heterogeneous\ncharacteristics of the SF network is crucial for the robustness of connectivity against failures [1], the efficiency of\ninformation delivery [3], and the spread of epidemic disease transmitted by means of social or sexual contacts,\ne-mails, Internet, and so forth [4], we expect that the\nevolutional mechanisms and the structural properties of\nthe SF network [1] are useful for improving the efficiency\nand the robustness of power supply, communication, and\neconomy systems.\nOn the other hand, recent studies classify networks according to quantities of connectivity correlations of nodes\nwith their neighbors [5]; social networks tend to have assortative connections between peers with similar degrees\n[6][7], while technological or biological networks tend to\nhave disassortative ones between those nodes with high\ndegrees, namely hubs, and those with low degrees [5][8].\nThe properties for the epidemic incidence [9] and for the\npercolation [10] have been compared in the considered\nforms of correlations defined as a weighted combination\nof the uncorrelated (or arbitrary correlated) term and\nthe fully assortative term: a fully assortative connection\nallows only two nodes with the same degree to be connected. However the relation of the results stated above\nto the evolutional mechanisms of network is still unclear.\nOnly a few analytical forms of correlations have been\nderived from the tree model [11] and the configuration\nmodel restricted such that at most one link exists between any pair of nodes [12]. Although the configuration\nmodel produces disassortative mixing, a non-trivial distribution of the desired degrees must be given for wiring\nin advance. Also, difficulties in estimating the conditional probability of degree-degree connectivity even from\n\nempirical data has been pointed out [13]. Apart from\nthe evolutional mechanisms, a numerical simulation has\nshown that the introduction of assortative hub-hub connections between different local areas on a lattice has the\neffects to shorten the average delivery time and to enlarge\nthe spread of infection [14]. However, neither theoretical\nsolutions nor numerical studies for the epidemic behavior\nhave been reported except for the above special forms of\ncorrelations.\nWe study epidemic spreading on the SF network with\na variety of assortative, disassortative, and uncorrelated\nconnections, which are not specialized in social, technological, or biological systems. First, we review two\ngrowing network models: one is called the duplicationdivergence model [15], which is equipped with a control\nparameter of connectivity correlations between the assortative and the disassortative mixings, and the other\nis called the directed growing model, in which the existence of correlations is suggested [13]. Then, we will\nestimate the conditional probability of degree-degree correlations from the average realizations of the growing network models. This estimation method can be applied to\nother network models. By using the estimated probability, we numerically investigate the epidemic behavior for\nthe mean-field-like equations of the susceptible-infectedrecovered/removed (SIR) model. We find different epidemic behavior according to the types of correlations.\nLet us consider the growing network models shown in\nFigs. 1 (a) and (b). The following procedures are repeated until the network reaches to the required size N .\nDup: duplication-divergence model [15]\n1. At each time step, a new node i\u2032 is added to the\nnetwork.\n2. Simultaneously, a node i is randomly chosen, and\nnew (undirected) links between all the neighbors j\nof i and the new node i\u2032 are duplicated.\n3.

(b) In the directed growing model, new\nlinks from randomly chosen sources to preferentially attached\nterminals emerge.\n\nIn the directed growing model, the rate equations for\nthe in-degree distribution are written as\nm\u2032\ndNk\n=\n[(k \u2212 1 + w)Nk\u22121 \u2212 (k + w)Nk ] + \u03b4k,1 ,\nd\u03c4\nm+w\n(1)\ndef\ndef\n\u2032\n\u2032\nwhere m = m + 1, \u03b3 = 1 + (m + w)/m , \u03b4k,1 is Kronecker's delta, the number of nodes with degree k is denoted by Nk (\u03c4 ) \u223c nk \u00d7 \u03c4 as similar to Ref. [11], and we\nobtain the solution\nnk =\n\n4. In the divergence process, each duplicated link is\nremoved with probability 1 \u2212 qe .\nThese local rules are biologically plausible [16]. Note that\nlarger qv enhances the assortativity of network generated\nby the above rules because the self-interaction means connecting a pair of nodes with similar degrees. In other\nwords, qv is a control parameter of the correlation.\nDir: directed growing model [13]\n1. At each time step, a new node is added and connected from a randomly chosen node.\n2. Simultaneously, m\u2032 new links emerge from randomly chosen nodes in the network.\n3. The terminals of the new links become attached to\nnodes chosen with shifted linear preference [11]: a\nnode with in-degree k is chosen as the terminal of\na new link with probability proportional to k + w,\nwhere w is a positive constant.\nThe generation of new links includes the wiring between\nold nodes at each time step. In addition, to keep the connectivity of network, the first procedure is modified from\nthe probabilistic addition of new nodes in Ref. [13]. If a\nmulti-link between already connected nodes or self-loop\nis created, it is skipped in the directed growing model,\nwhile there is no such link in the duplication-divergence\nmodel. In a sense of reality, the sender and the receiver\nof transmitted information or objects are distinguished\nfrom each other on a directed link.\n\n(k \u2212 1 + w)nk\u22121\n\u223c k \u2212\u03b3 .\nk \u2212 1 + w + 1 + (m + w)/m\u2032\n\n(2)\n\nThe second column of Table I shows the values of the\nparameters used in our simulation. Ass, Unc, and Dis\ndenote the assortative, uncorrelated, and disassortative\nnetworks, respectively. We regulate these values so that\nthey produce similar average degrees < k >, because it\nis obvious that the epidemic spreading becomes larger as\nthe degrees increase. Fig. 2 shows distributions of the\ndef\ndegree P (k) = Nk /N and the connectivity correlation\nP\ndef\n< knn > =\nl lP (l|k), where P (l|k) is the conditional\nprobability of the connections between nodes with degrees l and k in Dup, or the connections from nodes with\nin-degree l to those with k in Dir. The degree distributions exhibit the power-law behavior: the exponents vary\nas corresponding to the parameters \u03b3 of Ass and Unc in\nDir (Fig. 2 (b)), while they are close to each other in Dup\n(Fig. 2 (a)). The correlations are controlled between Ass\nand Dis in Dup (Fig. 2 (c)), while they are controlled between Ass and Unc that is nearly uncorrelated with very\nweak correlations in Dir (Fig. 2 (d)). If the connections\nare replaced by reciprocal ones after the configuration\nof Dir, the degree distribution becomes exponential, and\nthe correlation disappears.\nNext, we consider the SIR model in which individual\nnodes have three states: susceptible, infected, and recovered/removed. The densities of the nodes with degree (or in-degree in Dir) k in the respective states are\ndenoted by sk (t) = Sk (t)/Nk (t), \u03c1k (t) = Ik (t)/Nk (t),\nrk (t) = Rk (t)/Nk (t). By definition, the normalization\ncondition sk (t) + \u03c1k (t) + rk (t) = 1 holds at each time\nt.

The infected\nnode is removed at the rate \u03b4. Once an individual gets\ninfected and then recovers or removed, the state is never\nchanged any more. The microscopic stochastic simulation needs very expensive computation for studying the\nepidemic properties, therefore a macroscopic mean-field\napproximation is useful. We consider the spreading on\nthe averages of randomly generated networks for each of\nDup and Dir.\nFollowing Ref.

In\n(c) and (d), the red, green, and blue lines clearly show the\ncorrelations corresponding to the cases of Ass, Unc, and Dis\nin Table I. The observations for very large degrees are statistically dropping and fluctuating. These are the averages over\nthe 100 realizations.\n\nwhere \u0398k in the r.h.s of Eqs.

As applied to\nFig. 2 (c) or (d), the P (l|k) is estimated from the average over 100 realizations for each parameter specification\npresented in Table I. Since some degrees are missing in\nthe range Kmin < k < Kmax over the realizations, we\napply the cut-off value kc defined by Kmin .\nWe numerically investigate the dynamic behavior depends on the connectivity correlations by using the 4-th\norder Runge-Kutta method for Eqs. (3) and (4) with a\nstep width \u2206t = 10\u22123 . In our simulation, we assume\nthat an initial infection source is only on a hub with the\ndegree kc . Hence, for the other degrees k 6= kc we set\nsk (0) = 1 and \u03c1k (0) = rk (0) = 0. This assumption is\nnatural since the hub is much more vulnerable against\ninfection through the active communications with the\noutside.\nFigs. 3 (a) and\nP (b) show the fraction of the infected\nnodes I(t)/N = k Ik /N , and we see in the case of Ass\n(red line) it is slightly more insistent (Fig. 3 (a) for Dup)\nor larger (Fig. 3 (b) for Dir) than that in the case of Dis\n(blue line) and Unc (green line). The densities of the infected nodes \u03c1k (t) in Figs. 3 (c) and (d) show a property\nsimilar to that of I(t)/N .

(5) in particular through assortative connections.\ndef P\nFig. 4 shows the epidemic incidence R(T ) = k Rk (T ),\nwhich denotes the number of transitions from the total\ninfected nodes. We set T = 100 taking the convergent\ntime in Fig. 3 into account. The incidence is higher\nin the assortative networks (red line) than that in uncorrelated (green line) or disassortative networks (blue\nline), except at b = 0.1 and \u03b4 = 0.7, 0.9 in Dup. The\nexceptions suggest that the immune rate \u03b4 is an important factor for small b. In other words, if we set \u03b4 \u2032 = 1\nby a variable change of time t for Eqs. (3) and (4), we\nmust use b\u2032 = b/\u03b4, which may be larger than 1, instead\nof 0 < b < 1. These differences according to the types\nof correlations remarkably appear in Dir with smaller b.\nFurthermore, similar results are also obtained in the directed growing model based on preferentially attached\nterminals and sources by the in- and out-degrees, respectively.\n\n800\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\nrho_k(t)\n\n0.5\n\n600\n\nR(T)\n\nrho_k(t)\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0\n\nAss, b=0.1\nAss, b=0.3\nAss, b=0.5\nAss, b=0.9\nDis, b=0.1\nDis, b=0.3\nDis, b=0.5\nDis, b=0.9\nUnc, b=0.1\nUnc, b=0.3\nUnc, b=0.5\nUnc, b=0.9\n\n400\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\ntime t\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n0.1\n0\n\n200\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\ntime t\n\n60\n\n70\n\n0\n\n(c)\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n\n0.7\n\nrho_k(t)\n\ndelta\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nrho_k(t)\n\n0.4\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n800\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.1\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\ntime t\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n600\n\n0.1\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\ntime t\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nR(T)\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0.4\n\n1000\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.2\n\n(a)\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0\n\nAss, k=1\nAss, k=5\nAss, k=40\nUnc, k=1\nUnc, k=5\nUnc, k=40\n\n400\n\n(d)\n\nAss, b=0.1\nAss, b=0.3\nAss, b=0.5\nAss, b=0.9\nUnc, b=0.1\nUnc, b=0.3\nUnc, b=0.5\nUnc, b=0.9\n\n200\n\nFIG. 3: Time evolutions of (a) the fraction of infected nodes\nI(t)/N in Dup, (b) I(t)/N in Dir, (c) each \u03c1k (t) for k =\n1, 5, 40 in Dup, and (d) \u03c1k (t) in Dir at b = 0.1 and \u03b4 = 0.1.\nInset figures show similar behavior at b = 0.3 and \u03b4 = 0.5 as\nsome other example.

The differences are remarkable in the directed model. The results suggest that\nassortative connections enhance the epidemic spreading,\nand also they could contribute to improve the efficiency of\n\ninformation delivery. In contrast, the disconnections or\nsetting gatekeepers between nodes with similar degrees\nbecomes a local defense strategy such as acquaintance\nimmunization [18] for the spreading of viruses. Further\nworks will be carefully considered for comprehending the\neffects of correlations on the spreading.\n\n[1] R. Albert, H. Jeong, and A.-L. Barab\u00e1si, nature 406,\n378, (2000).\n[2] A.-L.
