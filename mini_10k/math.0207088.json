This upper bound is such that it can be easily controlled as\nthe line varies, and hence is used to sum the counting functions of the\nlines which cover the original variety V .\n\nMathematics Subject Classification: 11G50, 11D45, 11D04, 14G05.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn algebraic geometry, the general notion of studying an algebraic variety\nby studying families of curves which cover it is a very old and fruitful one.\nHowever, it has not been much used to study the density of rational points\non algebraic varieties, because there has not been the necessary uniformity\nin the results for lower-dimensional varieties and their counting functions.\nHeath-Brown suggests in [H-B] that the technique could be quite widely\nused, and gives an example of how to compute the counting function of a\ncertain cubic surface by studying families of cubic curves lying on it. In the\nspirit of this idea, we will describe in this paper a method for obtaining upper\nbounds (and in many cases, asymptotic formulae) for the counting functions\nfor rational points with respect to height on projective varieties which are\ncovered by lines.\nIn particular, we consider an algebraic variety V defined over a number\nfield K, embedded in projective space Pn for some n, and consider the usual\n\n1\n\n\f(multiplicative) height function, not normalised to be independent of the field\nK. We define the counting function thus:\nNL (B) = card{P \u2208 V (k) | H(P ) \u2264 B}\nThe counting function counts the number of K-rational points of V whose\nheight is at most B. (That this is well defined is an immediate consequence\nof a theorem of Northcott \u2013 see for example [Vo], Proposition 1.2.9.(g).)\nIf V is covered by a set L of lines, then we might hope to compute the\ncounting function of V by summing the respective counting functions for the\nlines in L:\nX\nNL (B)\nNV (B) =\nL\u2208L\n\nThere are several excellent estimates for NL (B) in the literature. The first of\nthese was that of Schanuel [Sch], in which Schanuel calculates very precisely\nthe asymptotics of the counting function for P1 over a number field K. The\nchief drawback of this is that the constant in the leading term depends on\nthe specific embedding of the line into Pn , so for our purposes we will need\na more specific calculation.\nThis, too, has been done, by Thunder [Th], in which he calculates the\nasymptotics of the counting function for an arbitrary line in Pn over an\narbitrary number field. Thunder makes clear that the leading term in the\ncounting function for a line L is:\ncK\nB2\nH(L)\nwhere H(L) denotes the height of the Pl\u00fccker point corresponding to L, and\ncK is a constant depending only on the number field K. However, for our\npurposes, we will want strict control of how many points of small height lie\non lines of large height, so the presence of an unbounded error term of any\nkind (which is definitely necessary in all theorems of the sort that Schanuel\nand Thunder sought) is fatal to our line of reasoning.\nThus, we must prove yet another result about heights of rational points\non lines, one which allows such a strict control \u2013 this result is Theorem 2.1.\nTo get this control, we sacrifice the quality of the constant cK , and we obtain\nonly an upper bound, rather than a lower one. However, Theorem 2.1 is still\ngood enough to give exactly the right exponent on B in the counting function\n2\n\n\ffor many algebraic varieties (see Theorem 3.1), so our sacrifices are certainly\noutweighed by our gains.\nTheorem 3.1 fits into the extensive literature which computes the counting functions of algebraic varieties, which is too large to summarise in a\nsatisfactory fashion here. Suffice it to say that it is compatible with the conjectures of Batyrev and Manin, and that a more comprehensive overview of\nthe history of the subject can be found in [Si].\n\n2\n\nRational Points on Lines\n\nLet K be an algebraic number field with ring of integers OK , and let L be a\nline in PnK . We wish to compute an upper bound for the counting function:\nNL (B) = card{P \u2208 L | H(P ) \u2264 B}\nwhere H(P ) denotes the standard height in projective space:\nY\nmax{|xi |v })\nH([x0 : . . . : xn ]) =\nv\n\ni\n\nwhere v ranges over all (isomorphism classes of) valuations on K. Note that\nwe do not normalise the height to be independent of the field K.\nSchanuel [Sch] derived some very precise asymptotics for NL (B):\nNL (B) = cB 2 + E(B)\nwhere c is a specific constant and E(B) is an error term which is o(B 2 ).\nSchanuel computes both of these quite precisely in the case that L = P1K .\nHowever, this estimate will not suffice for our present purpose, since we\nwish to control the set of points of small height on our lines as well. Furthermore, since our lines will not generally be identical to P1 , we wish to\nexplore the dependence of c on the height H(L) of the line L, which we define to be the height of the corresponding Pl\u00fccker point in the Grassmannian\nG(1, n). An asymptotic version of this has been derived by Thunder [Th],\nbut like Schanuel's result, does not control the behaviour of the points of\nsmall height.\nThus, say L corresponds to a 2-dimensional subspace of K n+1 , spanned\nby the vectors (a0 , . . . , an ) and (b0 , . . . , bn ). We define:\nH(L) = H((a0 dx0 + . . . + an dxn ) \u2227 (b0 dx0 + . . . + bn dxn ))\n3\n\n\f(n2 +n)/2\n\nwhere the result of the wedge product is interpreted as a point in PK\nwith homogeneous coordinates {dxi \u2227 dxj } for i 6= j.\nWe can now state the main result of this section:\n\nTheorem 2.1 The counting function for L satisfies the following inequalities:\ncK\nNL (B) \u2264\nB2 + 1\nH(L)\nwhere cK is a positive real constant depending only on the field K.\nProof: Our first step will be to identify the K-rational points of L with a set\nof lattice points in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space. Let [x0 : . . . : xn ]\nbe a K-rational point on L. By clearing denominators, we can ensure that\nxi \u2208 OK for all i. In fact, by choosing a fixed set J of representatives for the\nclass group of K, we can ensure that the coordinates xi generate an ideal in\nJ . This representation for [x0 : . . . : xn ] is unique up to multiplication by a\nunit of OK .\nLet M be the rank two OK -module M in K n+1 consisting of all the\nvectors in L whose coordinates all lie in OK . Let d = [K : Q], and denote by\n\u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3r1 the embeddings of K into R, and by \u03c41 , . . . , \u03c4r2 the embeddings\nof K into C, where d = r1 + 2r2 .\nUsing these embeddings, we can embed M as a lattice of rank 2d in\nV = (Rn+1)r1 \u2295 (Cn+1 )r2 . We will abuse notation by hereafter identifying M\nwith its image in V . Define:\n\u001a\nmaxj (|\u03c3i (aj )|)\nif i \u2264 r1\n|(a0 , . . . , an )|i =\nmaxj (|\u03c4i\u2212r1 (aj )|2 ) if i > r1\nThus, we can view [x0 : . . . : xn ] as a point in M whose coordinates generate\nan element of the fixed set J of ideals. Thus, there exists a positive constant\nc1 depending only on the field K such that:\nY\n1 Y\n|(x0 , . . . , xn )|i \u2264 H([x0 : . . . : xn ]) \u2264 c1\n|(x0 , . . . , xn )|i\nc1 i\ni\n\n(1)\n\nWe also define:\nk(x0 , . . . , xn )k = max{|(x0 , . . . , xn )|di i }\ni\n\n4\n\n(2)\n\n\fwhere di is 1 or 1/2, depending on whether i corresponds to a real or complex\nembedding, respectively.\n\u2217\nIf \u01eb \u2208 OK\nis a unit, then we have the relation:\n|\u01eb(x0 , . . . , xn )|i = |\u01eb|i |(x0 , . . . , xn )|i\nwhere |\u01eb|i represents the absolute value of \u01eb with respect to the embedding \u03c3i\n2\n(if i is at most r1 ) or \u03c4i\u2212r\n(if i is greater than r1 ). Thus, by the Dirichlet Unit\n1\nTheorem (see for example [Ne], Theorem 7.3), there is a positive real constant\nc2 depending only on K such that for any element v = (v1 , . . . , vr1 +r2 ) \u2208\n\u2217\nRr1 \u2295 Cr2 , there exists a unit \u01eb \u2208 OK\nsuch that |\u01ebvi |di \u2264 c2 |\u01ebvj |dj for all i\nand j, where di and dj are as in (2).\nApplying this to v = (|(x0 , . . . , xn )|1 , . . . , |(x0 , . . . , xn )|r1 +r2 ) reveals that\nthere is a positive real constant c3 depending only on K such that through\nmultiplication by a suitable unit, we may assume that for all i and j:\nd\n\n|(x0 , . . . , xn )|di i \u2264 c3 |(x0 , . . . , xn )|j j\nThus, by equations (1) and (2), we may find a positive real constant c4\ndepending only on K such that for all K-rational points P \u2208 L, we can find\na representation P = [x0 : . . . : xn ] as above such that:\n1\nH(P ) \u2264 k(x0 , . . . , xn )kd \u2264 cK H(P )\nc4\nThus, when calculating an upper bound for NL (B), it will suffice to compute\nan upper bound for the following function:\nNL\u2032 (B) = {v = (x0 , . . . , xn ) \u2208 M \u2032 | kvk \u2264 B}\nwhere M \u2032 denotes the set of vectors in M, counted modulo the action of K \u2217 .\nIn particular, we have:\nNL\u2032 (B) \u2265 NL (B)d\nWe will use the following well known result (it follows, for example, from\nwork of Thunder [Th]):\nLemma 2.2 There is a positive real constant \u03b1 depending only on K such\nthat the determinant of M is equal to \u03b1H(L).\n5\n\n\fWe therefore have reduced to showing that there is a positive real constant\nc, depending only on the field K, such that:\nNL\u2032 (B) \u2264\n\nc\nB 2d + 1\ndet(M)\n\nThus, fix a positive real number B. If NL (B) \u2264 1, then the result is clear,\nso assume that NL (B) \u2265 2. Then we can find two K-linearly independent\nlattice points P1 and P2 in M with H(Pi ) \u2264 B, since K-linearly dependent\npoints in M contribute only one point to NL (B).\nChoose a basis {\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1d } for OK over Z, and consider the set:\n{\u03b11 P1 , . . . , \u03b1d P1 , \u03b11 P2 , . . . , \u03b1d P2 }\nThere is a positive real constant \u03b1 depending only on K such that the height\nof \u03b1j Pi is at most \u03b1H(Pi ).\nFor any real number H, consider the set\nVM (H) = {v \u2208 M \u2297 R | kvk \u2264 H}\nThis set is convex and centrally symmetric, so by the previous arguments,\nit follows that the real simplex spanned by the vectors \u03b1j Pi is contained in\nVM (\u03b1B). In particular, we conclude that every element of L with height at\nmost B corresponds to a point of M which is a vertex of a 2d-dimensional\nreal simplex which is entirely contained in VM (\u03b1B) and whose vertices are\nall elements of M.\nV \u03b12d\nThe number of such simplexes is at most det(M\nB 2d , where V is the volume\n)\nof the standard 2d-dimensional real simplex. Each such simplex has 2d + 1\nvertices, so we conclude that:\nNL\u2032 (B) \u2264\nand hence the theorem follows.\n\n3\n\nV (2d + 1)\u03b12d 2d\nB +1\ndet(M)\n\u2663\n\nRuled Varieties\n\nIn the spirit of Heath-Brown's remark in [H-B], Theorem 2.1 enables us to\ngive easy upper bounds for the counting functions for rational points on ruled\nvarieties. For instance, consider the following situation.\n6\n\n\fLet V \u2282 Pn be a projective variety defined over a number field K. Assume that V admits a K-rational morphism \u03c6 : V \u2192 X to a projective\nvariety X over K such that the fibres of \u03c6 are lines. Then we can define a\nmorphism \u03c8 : X \u2192 G(1, n) by \u03c8(P ) = [\u03c6\u22121 (P )], where G(1, n) denotes the\nGrassmannian of lines in Pn . Let D be the Pl\u00fccker divisor on G(1, n) \u2013 that\nis, the pullback of O(1) via the Pl\u00fccker embedding of G(1, n). Note that \u03c8\nis injective, since \u03c6 is a morphism. We now have the following result:\nTheorem 3.1 Using the notation of the previous paragraph, assume that the\ncounting function of X with respect to the divisor A = \u03c8 \u2217 (D) satisfies:\nNX (B) = card{P \u2208 X(K) | HA (P ) \u2264 B} = O(B \u01eb )\nfor some \u01eb < 1. Then we have:\n(1/c)B 2 \u2264 NV (B) \u2264 cB 2\nfor some positive constant c.\nProof: The first inequality is clear by Schanuel's Theorem [Sch], since V\ncontains at least one K-rational line. Thus, we turn our attention to the\nsecond inequality. Write H for the usual height function in Pn , and let\nF = \u03c6\u2217 A. Via the height machine (see for example [Vo], Proposition 1.2.9),\nwe obtain a constant \u03b1 such that for all K-rational points P of V :\nHF (P ) \u2264 \u03b1H(P )\nWe can now calculate as follows:\nX\nNV (B) \u2264\n\n(3)\n\n\u03b1N\u03c6\u22121 (P ) (B)\n\nP \u2208X(K), HA (P )\u2264B\n\n\u2264\n\nX\n\n\u03b1\n\nP \u2208X(K), HA (P )\u2264B\n\n\u0012\n\ncK\nB2 + 1\nHA (P )\n\n\u0013\n\nwhere this last inequality is by Theorem 2.1 and the fact that H(\u03c6\u22121 (P )) =\nHA (P ). The hypothesis of the theorem now easily implies that this sum is\nasymptotically less than cB 2 for a positive constant c, and the theorem is\nproven. \u2663\nRemarks: In particular, Theorem 3.1 applies to all (relatively) minimal\nruled surfaces (see section V.2 of [Ha] for a discussion of such surfaces).\n7\n\n\f(This is not quite true, since the two cases of P1 \u00d7 P1 and P2 blown up\nat a single point do not satisfy the hypotheses of Theorem 3.1, but they\ncan be handled in a similar manner, or indeed by any number of elementary\napproaches as well.)\nThe arithmetic of relatively minimal ruled surfaces over a rational base\ncurve has been dealt with admirably in several places, including most notably\nin the very general treatment of Batyrev and Tschinkel [BT] in the context of\ntoric varieties, and in a more specific and explicit way by Billard [Bi]. Note\nthat in both these works, the authors not only obtain the exponent in the\nleading term of the counting function, but they also compute the constant\nin the leading term and compute error terms, neither of which we are able\nto do here.\nFinally, we remark that the results of Theorem 3.1 are consistent with\nthe conjectures of Batyrev and Manin [BM].\nTheorem 2.1 can in principle be applied to any variety which is a union\nof lines in Pn , by the simple expedient of summing the counting functions of\nthe individual lines, and controlling the point of smallest height on each line.\nSuch an analysis proceeds trivially for Pn , for example, which is the union of\na pencil of lines through a fixed point, and the exponent on the upper bound\nthereby obtained is sharp (n + 1). Similar analyses can be done for cones \u2013 in\nboth cases, the point of smallest height on (almost all) lines is the basepoint\nof the linear system which sweeps out the variety.\nOne might hope to obtain analogues of Theorem 2.1 for curves other than\nlines. Indeed, Heath-Brown in [H-B] did so with his Theorems 2 and 3 (the\nlatter is conditional on a certain hypothesis on the ranks of elliptic curves).\nHowever, the chief advantage of Theorem 2.1 is that the asymptotic growth\nof the counting function shrinks as the height of the line grows, making it\nmuch easier to sum counting functions over infinitely many lines. It would\nbe interesting to try to obtain analogues of Theorem 2.1 for curves of higher\ndegree.\n\nReferences\n[BM] Batyrev, V. and Manin, Yu., Sur le nombre de points rationnels de\nhauteur born\u00e9e des vari\u00e9t\u00e9s alg\u00e9briques, Math.
