Generalizations to the non-extremal case are not analyzed explicitly, but can be pursued as indicated.\n\n1\n\nAspirant FWO\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nDilaton-gravity plane waves play a special role in string theory and related approaches to\nquantum gravity, since they provide a rare example of tractable strongly curved (possibly\nsingular) space-time backgrounds that depend on (light-cone) time (see, for instance, [1, 2],\nas well as the recent work by some of the present authors [3]). Furthermore they permit a\nformulation of (time-dependent) matrix theories of quantum gravity [4, 5].\nA likewise prominent role is accorded to the p-brane supergravity solutions (see, e.g., [6]).\nThrough their connection with the D-branes of string theory, they lead to the formulation\nof the AdS/CFT correspondence [7] and its generalizations to different dimensions [8].\nHence, it appears important to derive supergravity solutions describing p-branes embedded into dilaton-gravity plane waves. The simplest of these solutions are supersymmetric\nconfigurations corresponding to extremal p-branes aligned along the propagation direction\nof the plane wave (the existence of such configurations can be suggested by the DBI worldvolume analysis for the corresponding D-branes). Some considerations of these, and related,\nconfigurations have been undertaken in [9, 10, 11, 12] for highly specific choices of the plane\nwave profile (for some other related publications, see [13, 14, 15, 16]). Our present purpose\nis to derive this type of solutions without any assumptions regarding the functional shape\nof the asymptotic plane wave.\n\n2\n\nSome general considerations\n\nWe shall start by inspecting the ten-dimensional Einstein-frame supergravity equations of\nmotion (see, e.g., [6]):\n\u0014\n\u0015\nX 1\n\u0001\n1\nnN \u2212 1 2\naN \u03c6\n2\nR\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u2202\u03bd \u03c6 +\nnN FnN \u03bc\u03bd \u2212\ne\nFnN g\u03bc\u03bd ,\n(1)\n2\n2n\n8\nN!\nN\nX aN\neaN \u03c6 Fn2N ,\n(2)\n\u0003\u03c6 =\n2n\n!\nN\nN\n\u0001\n\u221a\n\u2202\u03bc1\n\u2212geaN \u03c6 F \u03bc1 ***\u03bcnN = 0,\n(3)\n\u2202[\u03bc F\u03bc1 ***\u03bcnN ] = 0,\n(4)\nwhere N labels the various form fields of the theory, with field strengths FnN of rank nN ,\nand aN = (5 \u2212 nN )/2 for Ramond-Ramond form fields, for the following ansatz:\n\u0001\nds2E = A(u, r) \u22122dudv + K(u, r)du2 + dy\u03b12 + B(u, r) dx2a,\n(5)\n\u03c6 = \u03c6(u, r),\n(6)\n\u0014\n\u0015\np\u22123\nxa F (u, r)A(p+1)/2 e 2 \u03c6\n1\nFuv\u03b11 ***\u03b1p\u22121 a =\n\u01eb\u03b11 ***\u03b1p\u22121 \u221a\n(p \u2264 3),\n(7)\n(7\u2212p)/2\nr\nB\n2 p=3\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\nxa\n(p \u2265 3),\n(8)\nF (u, r)\u01eba1 ***a8\u2212p a \u221a\nFa1 ***a8\u2212p =\nr\n2 p=3\n1\n\n\fwhere r 2 = xa xa , p is the number of spatial dimensions of the p-brane, F is the field\nstrength of the corresponding Ramond-Ramond\nform, \u03b1 runs from 1 to p \u2212 1 and a runs\n\u221a\nfrom 1 to 9 \u2212 p; the factors of 1/ 2 are only inserted into the form field ansatz for the\nself-dual case p = 3. This ansatz is not the most general one allowed by the symmetries\n(in particular, there is no Poincar\u00e9 symmetry relating guv and g\u03b1\u03b1 when the u-dependences\nare non-trivial), however it will prove sufficiently general for our purposes.\nWe shall refer the reader to the appendix for the explicit \"raw\" form of the equations of\nmotion for our ansatz, and only present here their convenient combinations.

Once that has been accomplished, all the integration constants\nshould be promoted to functions of u, and the result should be substituted into (14), which\nwill constrain the u-dependences. Finally, (15) will determine K. This algebraic structure\nessentially reduces the u-dependent case to the u-independent one.\nThe solution for the u-independent case corresponding to our present ansatz has been\ngiven in [17]. Essentially, one eliminates the Q-dependent terms (coming from the form\nfield) from (11) and (12) using (10) to obtain\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0013\u2032\n2(p \u2212 3) A\u2032\n\u2032\n8\u2212p (p+1)/2 (7\u2212p)/2\n\u03c6 \u2212\nr A\nB\n= 0,\n(16)\n7\u2212p A\n\u0010\n\u0001 \u0011\u2032\n15\u22122p\n(p+1)/2 (7\u2212p)/2 \u2032\nA\nB\nr\n= 0.\n(17)\n\nThese equations are easily integrated, whereupon (10) reduces to a Liouville equation (onedimensional classical particle moving in an exponential potential) with respect to a new\nvariable \u03c1 defined as d/d\u03c1 = r 8\u2212p A(p+1)/2 B (7\u2212p)/2 d/dr. All the non-linearity of the problem\nbecomes concentrated in this simple non-linear equation, which can be solved explicitly in\nterms of hyperbolic functions. Furthermore, as it turns out, equation (13) can be equivalently rewritten as an energy value specification for the above-mentioned Liouville equation\nand simply reduces to one constraint on the integration constants. We shall refer the reader\nto [17] for explicit expressions.\nEven though the static (u-independent) problem can be solved explicitly for our ansatz,\nit appears to be of limited use for general non-extremal p-branes. The ansatz we have\nchosen was not the most general one allowed by the symmetries of the problem (though it\nwill suffice for constructing the extremal solutions we are aiming at, and help us to keep the\nderivations reasonably compact), and in the presence of strong non-linearities, one should\nexpect all types of motion permitted by the symmetry constraints to mix. In particular,\none should relax the equality of guv and g\u03b1\u03b1 (some of related static non-extremal solutions\nhave been constructed in [18], and a rather general analysis has been presented in [19]), and\nadd a non-zero gua . In our present investigations, we shall not pursue this computationextensive program, concentrating instead on the case of extremal p-branes, which can be\ncompletely analyzed using the ansatz (5-8).\n\n3\n\nExtremal solutions\n\nTo obtain extremal p-brane solutions, we take particular integrals of (16) and (17), namely:\nA(p+1)/2 B (7\u2212p)/2\n\n\u0001\u2032\n\n\u03c6\u2032 \u2212\n\n= 0,\n\n2(p \u2212 3) A\u2032\n= 0.\n7\u2212p A\n\n(18)\n\n(These particular integrals are known to correspond to extremal p-branes for the u-independent\ncase.) One can then take\n\u0013(p\u22127)/8\n\u0012\nR7\u2212p\n(19)\nA \u221d 1 + 7\u2212p\nr\n3\n\n\f(where R will turn out to be simply another parametrization for the brane charge Q; we\nshall restore the expressions for the form field explicitly in our final results), compute the\ncorresponding B and \u03c6 using (18), and check that the resulting A, B and \u03c6 solve both (10)\nand (13). Equations (10-13) have now been satisfied.\nAs explained in the previous section, one needs to further promote all the integration\nconstants to functions of u and solve (14) and (15). The u-dependent prefactor in guv can\nbe changed arbitrarily by a redefinition of u, and we can use this freedom to relate the\nu-dependent prefactor of A to the u-dependence of the dilaton.

It is known, however, that, by redefining v and xa , plane wave metrics can\nalways be put into a form that makes the r 2 du2 term in the metric vanish, with the wave\n2\n\nIt is always possible to add terms solving the homogeneous version of (22), i.e., r0 and 1/r7\u2212p with\narbitrary u-dependent coefficients. The r-independent term can be absorbed into a redefinition of v. The\n1/r7\u2212p term describes a peculiar singular pp-wave that propagates parallel to the brane essentially not\ninteracting with it (in the sense that the shape of this wave does not affect the metric apart from its\nuu-component). We shall ignore these terms in our present considerations.\n\n4\n\n\fprofile encoded in \u03bc(u) (the Rosen form), or into a form that makes \u03bc(u) = 1, with the\nwave profile encoded in the coefficient of the r 2 du2 term in the metric (the Brinkmann\nform). Not surprisingly, this kind of transformations can be extended to our entire p-brane\nsolutions (at all values of r).\nMore specifically, one can check that the transformation\n\u00137\u2212p p\u22125 !\n\u0012\n2\nr\u0303\nr\u0303\nR\nv = \u1e7d + \u03bc(u)\u03b7(u)\u03b7\u0307(u)\n,\nxa = \u03b7(u)x\u0303a\n(24)\n+ h(u)\n2\n\u03b7(u)\np\u22125\npreserves the algebraic form of our ansatz given by (5) and (20), while multiplying \u03bc by \u03b7 2 .\nSince \u03b7 is an arbitrary function of u, it can be used to set \u03bc to 1, in which case our p-brane\nsolution is parametrized in a way that approaches the Brinkmann form of the plane wave\nin the asymptotic region.

For p = 1, (21) of [9] corresponds3 to a special choice of f (u) in the\ndilaton profile (logarithmic in u, if the definition of u is changed to agree with the one we are\nusing), for which (in the asymptotically Rosen frame, different from the one used in (26) and\nrelated to it by transformations of the form (24)), the du2 term disappears from the metric\nand the u- and r-dependences factorize throughout. For p > 1, (21) of [9] corresponds to a\nplane wave asymptotics different from (27), with non-trivial y\u03b1 polarizations present in the\nasymptotic plane wave (there is a u-dependent function multiplying dy\u03b12 in the asymptotic\nexpression for the metric). We have not considered such asymptotic plane waves here\nfor the sake of compactness, but one should not expect any considerable complications in\nincluding them (the brane geometry is trivial in the longitudinal directions, so superposing\nplane waves polarized in y\u03b1 -directions on it should be even simpler than for the case of xa directions). The reason why only special choices of the functional shape of the asymptotic\nplane wave appeared in the previous publications is that assumptions have been made about\nu- and r-dependence factorization, or about the absence of du2 terms in the metric. By\nrelaxing these assumptions, we have restored the functional arbitrariness of the asymptotic\nplane wave profile.\n\n4\n\nSupersymmetry\n\nThe fact that, in constructing our solutions, we have relied on the particular integrals (18)\nof the equations of motion (which, for the u-independent case, correspond to extremal\nBPS solutions) makes it natural to expect that our u-dependent solutions will likewise be\nsupersymmetric (and thus related to the D-branes of string theory).

[11] suggests that this family of solutions should have two free\nparameters (three numbers, a, b and c with one quadratic constraint). However, we believe that there is\nin fact only a one-parameter family in (39) of [11], corresponding to the single parameter Q of [9] (when\nthe 5-brane charge is set to 0). An additional constraint on a, b and c of [11] (restoring the correspondence\nbetween (39) of [11] and (21) of [9]) can be derived by considering the ur-component of Einstein's equations.\n\n6\n\n\fThese supersymmetry variations are written in a formalism where both form fields and their\nduals are explicitly present, and we should use the duals of the forms of (5-8) for p > 3 (we\nshall also not consider explicitly the p = 3 self-dual case for the sake of compactness).\nWe shall examine the supersymmetry variations for the following ansatz, written in\nstring frame:\nds2 = As (u, r)(\u22122dudv + K(u, r)du2 + dy\u03b12 ) + Bs (u, r)dx2a ,\n\n(31)\n\nwith\n\u0013\u22121/2\nR7\u2212p\nAs = e A = 1 + h(u) 7\u2212p\n,\nr\n\u0012\n\u00131/2\nR7\u2212p\n\u03c6/2\nBs = e B = \u03bc(u) 1 + h(u) 7\u2212p\nr\n\u03c6/2\n\n\u0012\n\n(32)\n(33)\n\nand\n\u0013\n\u0012\n3\u2212p\nR7\u2212p\n3\u2212p\nln 1 + h(u) 7\u2212p = f (u) \u2212\nln As ,\n\u03c6 = f (u) +\n4\nr\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\na\nR7\u2212p\nxa\n\u2212f x\nFuv\u03b11 .....\u03b1p\u22121a = e\n\u2202r 1 + h(u) 7\u2212p\n\u01eb\u03b11 ...\u03b1p\u22121 = 2e\u2212f A\u2032s As \u01eb\u03b11 ...\u03b1p\u22121 .\nr\nr\nr\n\n(34)\n(35)\n\nThis ansatz includes (and is considerably more general than) our solution (26).\nThe supersymmetry variations are given by\n!\n\u0015\n\u0014 \u00e2\n\u2032\n\u00e2\n\u01eb\n3\n\u2212\np\n\u0226\nA\nx\n3\n\u2212\np\nx\n\u03b1\u0302\n...\u03b1\u0302\ns\n1\np\u22121\ns\n\u22121/2\n\u00fb\n\u00e2\n\u00fbv\u0302\n\u03b1\u0302\n...\u03b1\u0302\n\u00e2\n\u2032\n1\np\u22121\nAs \u03b3 \u03b5 \u2212\n\u03b3 \u03b5\u2212\n\u03b3\n\u03b5 ,\n\u03b4\u03bb = f \u0307 \u2212\n2 As\n2 As Bs1/2 r\n(p \u2212 1)!\nr\n!\n1/2\n\u00e2\n1 \u0226s v\u0302\u00fb 1 As\nx\n\u03b4\u03c8u = \u2202u \u2212\n\u03b3 +\n\u03b5\nK \u2032 \u03b3 \u00fb\u00e2\n4 As\n4 Bs1/2\nr\n\u0013 \u0014 \u00e2\n\u0015\n\u0012\n\u01eb\u03b1\u03021 ...\u03b1\u0302p\u22121 \u00fbv\u0302\u03b1\u03021 ...\u03b1\u0302p\u22121 \u00e2 x\u00e2 \u2032\n1\nx \u00e2\nA\u2032s\nK \u00fb\nv\u0302\n\u2212\n\u03b3 \u03b5\u2212\n\u03b3\n\u03b5 ,\n\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3\n1/2\n4 A1/2\n2\nr\n(p \u2212 1)!\nr\ns Bs\n\u0014 \u00e2\n\u0015\n\u01eb\u03b1\u03021 ...\u03b1\u0302p\u22121 \u00fbv\u0302\u03b1\u03021 ...\u03b1\u0302p\u22121 \u00e2 x\u00e2 \u2032\n1\nA\u2032s\n\u00fb x\n\u00e2\n\u03b3\n\u03b4\u03c8v = \u2202v \u03b5 \u2212\n\u03b3 \u03b5\u2212\n\u03b3\n\u03b5 ,\n1/2\n4 A1/2\nr\n(p \u2212 1)!\nr\ns Bs\n!\n\u0015\n\u0014 \u00e2\n\u01eb\u03b1\u03021 ...\u03b1\u0302p\u22121 \u00fbv\u0302\u03b1\u03021 ...\u03b1\u0302p\u22121 \u00e2 x\u00e2 \u2032\n1\nA\u2032s\n1 \u0226s \u00fb\u03b1\u0302\n\u00e2\n\u03b1\u0302 x\n\u03b5+\n\u03b3\n\u03b3 \u03b5\u2212\n\u03b3\n\u03b5 ,\n\u03b3\n\u03b4\u03c8\u03b1 = \u2202\u03b1 \u2212\n1/2\n4 As\n4 A1/2\nr\n(p \u2212 1)!\nr\ns Bs\n\"\n#\n!\nb\u0302\n\u2032\nX xb\u0302\n\u01eb\n1\nx\n\u1e02s\nA\n1\n\u03b1\u0302 ...\u03b1\u0302\ns \u00e2\n\u03b4\u03c8a = \u2202a \u2212\n\u03b3\n\u03b3 b\u0302 \u03b5 \u2212 1 p\u22121 \u03b3 \u00fbv\u0302\u03b1\u03021 ...\u03b1\u0302p\u22121 b\u0302 \u03b5\u2032\n\u03b3 \u00fb\u00e2 \u03b5 \u2212\n4 As1/2 Bs1/2\n4 As\nr\n(p \u2212 1)!\nr\nb\u03026=\u00e2\n\n+\n\n(\u22121)p A\u2032s \u01eb\u03b1\u03021 ...\u03b1\u0302p\u22121 \u00fbv\u0302\u03b1\u03021 ...\u03b1\u0302p\u22121 xa \u2032\n\u03b3\n\u03b5\n4 As (p \u2212 1)!\nr\n7\n\n(36)\n\n\f(where x\u00e2 simply denotes xa with the numerical value of a set equal to \u00e2, and summation\nover repeated indices is understood).

We have assumed an isotropic plane\nwave polarization in the directions transverse to the brane worldvolume, and the absence\nof polarization components along the brane worldvolume. No assumptions have been made\nabout the functional shape of the plane wave profile, which is contained in our family of\nsolutions as an arbitrary function of the light-cone time.\nIt could be very interesting and important to generalize our results to the case of 0branes. In that case, there is no worldvolume to be aligned with the propagation direction\nof the wave, and the 0-brane is subject to forces induced by the plane wave. However, it\ncan be seen from the corresponding D0-brane DBI analysis that there are configurations\nfor which the gravity and dilaton forces balance each other and the 0-brane does not move.\nOne could expect relatively simple supergravity solutions for these cases, and they are\nalso precisely the solutions whose near-horizon geometry may have significance4 within the\ncontext of time-dependent matrix models. Unfortunately, our present derivations do not\nallow to construct such solutions.\nAfter this work had been completed, a recent preprint [22] addressing very similar issues\ncame to our attention. In that publication, a somewhat more general ansatz (compared to\nthe one we have used here) is examined (non-trivial asymptotic plane wave polarizations in\nthe directions parallel to the brane are added); considerations are also given to intersecting\nbrane solutions. The advantage of our present treatment is that all the light-cone time\ndependences are derived explicitly (in [22], the problem is reduced to ordinary differential\nequations, which are not solved), the equation determining the uu-component of the metric\n4\n\nWe thank S.

The inclusion of r0 and 1/r7\u2212p terms is\noptional, as far as the construction of plane-wave-p-brane solutions is concerned, cf. footnote 2.\n\n9\n\n\fThe remaining components are identically zero.
