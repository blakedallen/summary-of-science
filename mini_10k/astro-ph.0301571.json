We report the first detection of DCO+ in a circumstellar disk. The DCO+ J=5\u20134 line at 360.169 GHz\nis observed with the 15m James Clerk Maxwell Telescope in the disk around the pre-main sequence star TW Hya.\nTogether with measurements of the HCO+ and H13 CO+ J=4\u20133 lines, this allows an accurate determination of the\nDCO+ /HCO+ ratio in this disk.

It\nis also close to the DCN/HCN ratio obtained for pristine cometary material in the jet of comet Hale-Bopp. The\nobserved DCO+ /HCO+ ratio for TW Hya is consistent with theoretical models of disks which consider gas-phase\nfractionation processes within a realistic 2-D temperature distribution and which include the effects of freeze-out\nonto grains.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nthe abundant CO molecule\n\nDisks around pre-main sequence stars are the likely sites of\nthe formation of planetary systems (e.g., Beckwith 1999).\nPart of the gas and dust from the collapsing protostellar\nenvelope settles into this disk, where it may undergo a\ncomplex chemistry before incorporation into planets and\nicy bodies. Tracing this chemistry is a key goal of molecular astrophysics, not only to establish a chemical inventory prior to planet formation but also as a probe of the\ndynamical processes in disks such as radial and vertical\nmixing (e.g., Aikawa et al. 1999, Markwick et al. 2002).\nMoreover, the abundances and excitation of the molecules\nprovide unique insight into the physical structure of disks\nsuch as their temperature and density profiles (Dutrey et\nal. 1997, van Zadelhoff et al. 2001).\nDeuterated molecules are a particularly interesting\nprobe of the temperature history of interstellar and circumstellar gas. It is well known that the abundances of\ndeuterated molecules in cold pre-stellar cores and protostellar envelopes are enhanced by orders of magnitude\nover the elemental [D]/[H] abundance ratio of 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22125\nthrough fractionation (e.g., Watson 1976, Millar et al.\n1989). In particular, at temperatures below \u223c50 K, the\nreaction\n+\n\u2192\nH+\n+ H2 + 232 K\n3 + HD \u2190 H2 D\n\n(1)\n\nis driven strongly in the forward direction (e.g., Pagani et\nal. 1992). H2 D+ can subsequently transfer a deuteron to\nSend offprint requests to: E.F. van Dishoeck\n\nH2 D+ + CO \u2192 DCO+ + H2\n\n(2)\n\nleading to DCO+ /HCO+ ratios of order 0.01. Such high\nratios have indeed been observed in interstellar clouds\n(e.g., Gu\u00e9lin et al. 1977, Wootten et al. 1982, Butner et\nal. 1995, Williams et al. 1998) and in protostellar regions\n(van Dishoeck et al. 1995, Loinard et al. 2000, Shah &\nWootten 2001, Parise et al. 2002). Deuterium fractionation can also occur through reactions of atomic deuterium on the surfaces of interstellar grains (Tielens 1983),\nbut this is thought to affect primarily molecules which\nare formed on grains such as H2 CO and CH3 OH. The\nDCO+ /HCO+ ratio can thus serve as a clear measure of\nthe importance of low-temperature gas-phase deuterium\nfractionation processes. Moreover, this ratio is enhanced\nif the main destroyer of H+\n3 , -i.e., CO-, is depleted onto\ngrains, since reaction (1) then becomes an important H+\n3\nremoval route in addition to recombination with electrons,\nenhancing H2 D+ even more (Brown & Millar 1989, Stark\net al. 1999, Caselli et al. 1999). Thus, the DCO+ /HCO+\nratio can also trace the level of depletion.\nWe present here the first detection of the DCO+ ion\nin a circumstellar disk, using the James Clerk Maxwell\nTelescope (JCMT). Together with observations of the\nHCO+ ion and its optically thin isotope H13 CO+ , an accurate DCO+ /HCO+ ratio is derived. This ratio is subsequently compared with that found in the envelopes of\ndeeply embedded protostars - the precursor material of\n\n\fEwine F. van Dishoeck et al.: Detection of DCO+ in a circumstellar disk\n\n2\n\ndisks -, and with those observed in solar system objects,\nin particular comets - the remnant material of disks.\n\n2. Observations\nThe DCO+ J=5\u20134 rotational line at 360.169 GHz was observed with the JCMT1 on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. The dual\npolarization receiver B3 was used in single-sideband mode.\nThe backend was the Digital Autocorrelator Spectrometer\n(DAS) set at a resolution of \u223c0.15 km s\u22121 . The observations were taken in beam-switching mode with a throw of\n180\u2032\u2032 . The same set-up was used to observe the HCO+ and\nH13 CO+ J=4\u20133 lines at 356.734 and 346.998 GHz, respectively. The antenna temperatures were converted to mainbeam temperatures using a beam efficiency of 62%, calibrated from observations of planets by the telescope staff.\nThe flux calibration was checked against bright sources\nwith well-determined fluxes for different lines and was generally found to agree within 10%. The data were reduced\nand analyzed in the SPECX and CLASS data reduction\npackages.\nThe DCO+ search focussed on the disk around TW\nHya, an isolated T Tauri star (K8Ve) which is part of a\nyoung group of stars at a distance of only \u223c56 pc (Webb\net al. 1999). Its age is estimated to be \u223c7\u201315 Myr, somewhat older than most classical T Tauri stars, but its large\nlithium abundance and H\u03b1 equivalent width are indicative\nof continued active disk accretion at a rate of 10\u22128 M\u2299\nyr\u22121 (Kastner et al. 2002). TW Hya is surrounded by a\nnearly face-on disk of \u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u22122 M\u2299 (Wilner et al. 2000),\nwhich has been imaged recently in scattered light with the\nHubble Space Telescope (Krist et al. 2000). The extent of\nthe disk in the scattered light is \u223c200 AU, corresponding\nto a 3.6\u2032\u2032 radius at 56 pc. Since this size is small compared with the \u223c13\u2032\u2032 beam size of the JCMT at 360 GHz,\nthe data suffer from beam dilution. Thus, long integration\ntimes of typically 2\u20134 hrs were needed to detect the weak\nlines reported here.\nThe DCO+ and HCO+ observations are part of a larger\nsurvey for molecular lines from disks, which will be reported in Thi et al. (2003).\n\n3. Results\nIn Figure 1, the HCO+ , H13 CO+ and DCO+ spectra toward TW Hya are presented. All three lines are clearly\ndetected at the same velocity, VLSR =3.0\u00b10.1 km s\u22121 . The\nlines are very narrow, \u2206V \u2248 0.6 km s\u22121 , and do not show\nthe characteristic double-peak profile of a rotating disk,\nconsistent with the nearly face-on orientation. The lack\nof detection of the 12 CO 3\u20132 line at 30\u2032\u2032 offset positions\ndemonstrates that the molecular emission is indeed associated with the disk and not due to any remnant cloud\n1\n\nThe James Clerk Maxwell Telescope is operated by the\nJoint Astronomy Centre in Hilo, Hawaii, on behalf of the\nParticle Physics and Astronomy Research Council in the\nUnited Kingdom, the National Research Council of Canada\nand the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research.\n\nFig. 1.\nJCMT observations of the HCO+ J=4\u20133,\n13\n+\nH CO J=4\u20133 and DCO+ J=5\u20134 lines toward TW Hya.\nThe H13 CO+ and DCO+ spectra have been shifted by \u2013\n0.15 and \u20130.3 K, respectively.\nTable 1.

The critical densities of the observed HCO+ and DCO+ lines are at least\n106 cm\u22123 , further assuring that only the dense gas in the\ndisk is probed. The integrated line intensities are summarized in Table 1.\nMolecular column densities and abundances can be\nderived from the observed line strengths under different\nassumptions. In general, the emerging lines from interstellar gas are a complex function of abundance, excitation and radiative transfer effects. In circumstellar disks,\nwhere strong chemical gradients can exist in both vertical\nand radial directions, the interpretation of spatially unresolved data is particularly uncertain. However, since the\nmain interest of this study is in the DCO+ /HCO+ ratio,\nthe analysis can be considerably simplified if it is assumed\nthat DCO+ and HCO+ occupy roughly the same regions\nof the disk. Moreover, since the densities in disks are generally high in the regions where these molecules exist (> 106\ncm\u22123 ) (van Zadelhoff et al. 2001), the excitation can be\nassumed to be in local thermal equilibrium to first order.\nA single excitation temperature of 25 K is adopted in the\nfollowing analysis. Finally, both the H13 CO+ and DCO+\n\n\fEwine F. van Dishoeck et al.: Detection of DCO+ in a circumstellar disk\n\nlines are assumed to be optically thin. The observed line\nintensity ratio of HCO+ /H13 CO+ of \u223c7 compared with\nthe optically thin ratio of \u223c60 clearly indicates that the\nmain isotope HCO+ J=4\u20133 line is optically thick.\nThe inferred column densities for a 200 AU radius disk\nare included in Table 1. For an assumed gas + dust disk\nmass of 2 \u00d7 10\u22122 M\u2299 , the beam-averaged HCO+ abundance is \u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u221211 , derived from the optically thin\nH13 CO+ line assuming LTE excitation at 25 K (see Thi\net al. 2003 for details). This is significantly lower than\nthe typical HCO+ abundance of \u223c 10\u22129 \u2212 10\u22128 in dark\nclouds (e.g., Ohishi et al. 1992) and some protostellar envelopes (e.g., Sch\u00f6ier et al. 2002). Most of the observed\nemission is thought to originate from the warm intermediate layer of the disk just below the surface where the\nHCO+ abundance reaches a few \u00d710\u221210 (e.g., Aikawa et\nal. 2002, Willacy & Langer 2000). The molecules are significantly depleted in the cold midplane of the disk where\nthe bulk of the mass resides . For the TW Hya disk, observations of CO and other species indicate depletions up\nto a factor of 100 in the midplane (van Zadelhoff et al.\n2001).\n\n4. Discussion\nThe inferred column densities imply a beam-averaged\nDCO+ /HCO+ abundance ratio of 0.035 \u00b1 0.015, assuming a [12 C]/[13 C] isotopic ratio of 60 (see Table 1). The\nerror bar reflects the observational uncertainties. The\nDCO+ /HCO+ value is more than three orders of magnitude higher than the elemental [D]/[H] ratio of 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 ,\nillustrating that strong deuterium fractionation occurs in\ndisks.\nModels of the deuterium fractionation in disks have\nbeen calculated by Aikawa & Herbst (1999, 2001) and\nAikawa et al. (2002), with the latter models using a realistic 2-dimensional (2D) temperature and density structure\nof a flaring disk. The models include a detailed gas-phase\nchemistry network with freeze-out onto grains, but do not\ncontain an active grain-surface chemistry. The resulting\nDCO+ /HCO+ abundance is found to decrease with decreasing radius from \u223c 0.1 at 400 AU to < 0.01 at <50 AU,\nowing to the increasing temperature in the inner disk. The\nDCO+ /HCO+ ratio also decreases with height in the outer\ndisk, because of the higher temperatures in the upper layers. Close to the midplane where strong CO freeze-out occurs, the DCO+ /HCO+ ratio reaches high values, but this\nregion contributes negligibly to the observed emission due\nto the much lower overall abundances. Time-dependent\neffects appear to play a minor role, although results for\ndisks as old as 10 Myr have not been published. Overall,\nthe observed DCO+ /HCO+ ratio of 0.035\u00b10.015 averaged\nover the entire TW Hya disk appears consistent with these\nmodels.\nRoberts et al. (2002) show that the model results for\nmolecular clouds are lowered by a factor of a few if updated rate coefficients for reaction (1) are used. Since the\nmain processes affecting the DCO+ /HCO+ ratio in disks,\n\n3\n\nnamely low-temperature gas-phase reactions and freezeout of CO on grains, are the same as those in clouds,\nsimilar effects are expected for disk models using updated\nrate coefficients.\nOnly few other measurements of deuterated molecules\nin disks have been reported. Qi (2001) and Kessler et al.\n(2003) searched for DCN and HDO in several disks using\nthe Owens Valley Millimeter Array but obtained mostly\nupper limits. The inferred DCN/HCN ratio of < 0.002 is\nmuch lower than that for DCO+ /HCO+ found here.\nTable 2 summarizes the observed DCO+ /HCO+ and\nDCN/HCN ratios in different environments. It is seen that\nthe DCO+ /HCO+ ratio in the TW Hya disk is comparable\nto that found in cold dark cores where freeze-out has been\nobserved (e.g., L1544), testifying to the low temperatures\nin disks. Indeed, DCO+ /HCO+ ratios as high as 0.035\nare difficult to produce in models which do not include\nCO depletion (Roberts et al. 2002). It is higher than that\nfound in most protostellar envelopes, where heating has\naffected a larger fraction of the material resulting in higher\ntemperatures and less CO freeze-out.\nBecause comets spend much of the time since their\nformation in the cold outer region of the Solar System,\nthey are likely to contain the most primitive record of\nsolar nebula material. No DCO+ is observed in comets,\nbut DCN/HCN has been measured. In cold clouds and\nprotostellar envelopes, the observed DCN/ HCN ratios\nare often comparable to the DCO+ /HCO+ ratios (see\nTable 2), even though they involve different fractionation\nreactions. The most pristine material originating from below the comet surface and emanating in jets shows very\nhigh DCN/HCN ratios comparable to those seen in cold\ndark clouds and in the TW Hya disk. The upper surface\nlayers which evaporate to produce the coma have significantly lower ratios, indicative of processing in the solar\nnebula.\nThe similarity of the deuterium fractionation ratios in\ncold clouds, disks and pristine cometary material suggests\nthat the gas spends most of its lifetime at low temperatures and is incorporated into the disks before the envelope is heated, i.e., before the Class I stage. Alternatively,\nthe DCO+ /HCO+ ratio may be reset in disks by lowtemperature gas-phase chemistry. Comparison of D/H ratios of molecules which enter the disk in the gas phase\n(such as HCO+ ) and those which are likely incorporated as\nices (e.g., H2 CO, CH3 OH) can distinguish between these\nscenarios. Also, spatially resolved data can further test the\nmodels, since the high ratios observed here probe largely\nthe outer disk.\nThe data presented in this paper are at the limit\nof the capabilities of current observational facilities. The\nAtacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) will be essential\nto provide high-resolution measurements of D/H ratios in\ndisks down to comet- and planet-forming regions.\nAcknowledgements.
