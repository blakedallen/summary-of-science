The fundamental idea of PQT is very simple.\nWe begin with a Hartree\u2013Fock\u2013Bogoliubov determinant\n(thereby mixing states of differerent particle number)\nand then restore particle number symmetry with the\naid of projection operators in a self-consistent variationafter-projection (VAP) manner. Without breaking any\nother symmetries, this reduces to the standard antisymmetrized geminal power (AGP) wavefunction. However,\nwe can also deliberately break and restore spin symmetry,\npoint group symmetry, and complex conjugation symmetry, all within the same general framework. In each case,\nthis deliberate symmetry breaking and restoration allows\nus to construct fairly sophisticated multiconfigurational\nwavefunctions with mean-field computational scaling.\nClosely related to PQT, at least conceptually, is projected Hartree\u2013Fock (PHF), where particle number symmetry is not broken and the projection operators act on\nan N -electron determinant. The PHF acronym in quantum chemistry is usually associated with spin-projection\nin a projection-after-variation (PAV) approach2 where\nthe deformed (i.e., symmetry broken) determinant |\u03a6i\nvariationally minimizes the energy\nE\u03a6 =\n\nh\u03a6|\u0124|\u03a6i\n,\nh\u03a6|\u03a6i\n\n(1)\n\nand is then used to construct a projected state |\u03a8i =\nP\u0302 |\u03a6i whose energy is given by\nE\u03a8 =\n\nh\u03a6|P\u0302 \u2020 \u0124 P\u0302 |\u03a6i\nh\u03a6|P\u0302 \u2020 P\u0302 |\u03a6i\n\n=\n\nh\u03a6|\u0124 P\u0302 |\u03a6i\nh\u03a6|P\u0302 |\u03a6i\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\nHere, we have used the fact that the projection operator P\u0302 is Hermitian, idempotent, and commutes with\n\nthe Hamiltonian. The PAV approach is computationally\nquite simple, but has several drawbacks. Near regions\nof spontaneous symmetry breaking, the PAV energy can\nbe ill behaved.3 Moreover, the projection is often carried\nout only approximately,4 i.e. without removing all spin\ncontaminants. This may lead to a large deviation in the\nexpectation value h\u015c 2 i for the projected state when the\nreference determinant has contaminants of many different spins.5 Lastly, the wavefunction is not variationally\noptimized, complicating the evaluation of properties depending on its derivatives.\nThese defects can be remedied by using a selfconsistent VAP approach, wherein one obtains the deformed determinant |\u03a6i by variationally minimizing the\nenergy E\u03a8 of Eqn. 2 with respect to |\u03a6i, as first proposed by L\u00f6wdin in his extended Hartree\u2013Fock method\n(EHF).6 More often than not, EHF has been associated with the use of a spin projection operator on a\nreference unrestricted determinant (the so-called spinprojected EHF7 ), and we will follow this usage. We\nshould note that Goddard's GF method8 is equivalent\nto EHF, while in certain limits also the spin-coupled valence bond (SCVB) method9 corresponds to EHF. The\nuse of projected wavefunctions in quantum chemistry is\nnowadays very limited, but they are ubiquitous in fields\nsuch as nuclear physics.10\u201312\nSeveral authors have proposed different ways to optimize the EHF wavefunction in quantum chemistry.\nMayer's derivation was based on the Brillouin theorem\nfor the projected state.13 His derivation relied heavily\non the pairing theorem by L\u00f6wdin.14 Rosenberg and\nMartino15 , and later Klimo and Tin\u0306o16 , used a direct\nminimization of the energy functional. More recently,\nByrman suggested an optimization technique based on\nthe fact that the EHF wavefunction is recovered when\na single spin wavefunction is used in the context of the\nspin-coupled valence bond method.9 Our purpose in this\npaper is to show how to carry out a VAP optimization of\n\n\f2\na PHF wavefunction in an alternative, computationally\nefficient, manner. In achieving this goal, we are guided\nby our previous work.1\nThe derivation of the PQT equations relied on expressing a general Hartree\u2013Fock\u2013Bogoliubov determinant\n|\u03a6i using its Thouless parametrization with respect to\nthe bare vacuum |\u2212i. In other words, we implicitly\nwrote |\u03a6i = e\u1e90 |\u2212i.1,17 This parametrization requires\nh\u03a6|\u2212i 6= 0. In the case of PHF, however, the deformed\ndeterminant is a number eigenfunction with N electrons\nand is thus orthogonal to the bare vacuum. The PQT\nderivation cannot then be blindly applied. The practical\nconsequence of this orthogonality is that one encounters\nindeterminancies in the PQT equations when using reference determinants whose one-particle density matrix has\noccupation numbers equal to zero.\nWhile the PQT derivation cannot straightforwardly be\nextended to derive corresponding PHF equations, the\nunderlying conceptual framework is similar. That is,\nwe wish to express the energy of the projected state\nin terms of the one-particle density matrix of a broken\nsymmetry reference determinant. Having done so, the\nenergy can be minimized with respect to the reference\ndeterminant's density matrix, leading to an effective oneparticle Hamiltonian to be variationally optimized. We\nthus follow the basic ideas used in PQT to derive the\nPHF equations from scratch. Our derivation and resulting equations afford spin symmetry restoration of both\ncollinear and non-collinear broken symmetry determinants in a straighforward manner, where collinear (unrestricted Hartree\u2013Fock-type) determinants are eigenfunctions of \u015cz and non-collinear determinants (generalized\nHartree\u2013Fock-type) are not. Additionally, we can readily\nrestore complex conjugation or point group symmetry as\nwell, just as we did in PQT. All of this is accomplished\nin essence by choosing a more convenient representation\nof the projection than the standard L\u00f6wdin projection\noperators used historically.\nThe use of non-collinear reference determinants in the\noptimization of projected Hartree\u2013Fock states has been\nlimited to the work by Lunell on the two-electron series.18\nThe complex molecular orbital method of Hendekovi\u010719\nis closely related to our complex conjugation projection\nbut has seen little use. Unlike these approaches, however, our implementation of PHF readily allows for the\nsimultaneous restoration of many symmetries at once.\nOur method is also related to the VAMPIR method of\nSchmid et al.,20 though the optimization of the reference\ndeterminant is carried out in a very different way.\nThe properties of the projected Hartree\u2013Fock wavefunction have been studied extensively by many authors.\nWe point the interested reader to the review by Mayer7\non the spin-projected EHF method as a starting point\nto access the wide literature on the subject. In particular, we mention that properties of the density matrices characterizing the standard EHF states (i.e., those\nbased on collinear determinants) have been derived by\nHarriman,21 Hardisson and Harriman,22 , Mestechkin,23\n\nand Phillips and Schug.24 Simons and Harriman25 derived properties of the point-group projected Hartree\u2013\nFock wavefunction.\nWe should also point out some of the vices of PHF:\nthe method is neither size consistent nor size extensive,\nas it has been noted before.26 Recall that a size consistent method is one where the dissociation limit of the\nsystem AB is equal to the energy of A plus the energy\nof B; a size-extensive method is one where the energy\nis proportional to the number of particles. Our results\nin this paper confirm previous conclusions26,27 that, in\nthe thermodynamic limit, the PHF energy per particle\nreduces to that of the broken symmetry mean field. In\nother words, as the number of electrons becomes large\nenough, PHF has nothing to add over standard Hartree\u2013\nFock except that it retains good quantum numbers which\nthe broken symmetry Hartree\u2013Fock state loses.\nSection II discusses the details of the projection we\nuse before deriving the energy of our projected wavefunction and the variational equations we solve to obtain it. In Sec. III we present the results of applying\nour equations in the description of molecular dissociation processes and in the computation of singlet-triplet\nsplittings, before drawing a few conclusions in Sec. IV.\nIn the interest of brevity, we have deferred the detailed\nequations for our effective Hamiltonian to the appendix.\n\nII.\nA.\n\nTHEORY\n\nProjection Operators\n\nThe complicated nature of Mayer's EHF equations\nowes much to the form of the projection operator used.\nThis form is due to L\u00f6wdin,6 and writes\nP\u0302 s =\n\nY\nl6=s\n\n\u015c 2 \u2212 l(l + 1)\n.\ns(s + 1) \u2212 l(l + 1)\n\n(3)\n\nApplying this operator to a wavefunction composed\nof multiple different spins just returns the component\nwith spin s, and annihilates the components with other\nspins. While this spin operator does not project the zcomponent of spin, it can be generalized to do so. Given a\nsimpler way of writing the projection operators and evaluating the projected energy E\u03a8 in terms of the deformed\ndeterminant |\u03a6i, one would have a computationally simpler scheme whose results are identical to those of Mayer\nin the case of spin projection.\nFortunately, such a simple representation of general\nprojections exists.10,11 In our previous paper,1 we omitted some details about the form of the projection, a fact\nwe intend to remedy here. We start our discussion by emphasizing that by projected Hartree\u2013Fock theory (PHF)\nwe mean recovering a wavefunction with good quantum\nnumbers from an intrinsically deformed HF state, and do\nnot demand the use of actual projection operators in a\n\n\f3\nstrict mathematical sense. In other words, while we require that the wavefunction P\u0302 |\u03a6i be an eigenfunction of\nthe relevant symmetry operators, we do not insist that\nP\u0302 is either Hermitian or idempotent.\nIf a single operator \u039b\u0302 can be associated with a constant\nof motion (that is, \u039b\u0302 commutes with the Hamiltonian),\none can write a projection operator as\nZ\n1\nP\u0302 \u03bb =\nd\u03c6 ei\u03c6(\u039b\u0302\u2212\u03bb) ,\n(4)\nL L\nwhere \u03bb is the eigenvalue recovered and L is the corresponding volume of integration.10 We note that this form\ncan be used to project onto eigenfunctions of \u015cz .\nIf, on the other hand, there is a set of operators that\ncommute with the Hamiltonian (but not necessarily with\neach other) and which form a group G = {\u011d}, then one\ncan recover the correct symmetries by diagonalizing the\nHamiltonian in the basis formed by the elements of the\ngroup. In other words,\nX\n|\u03a8i =\ncg \u011d|\u03a6i,\n(5)\ng\n\nwith the coefficients being determined by the solution to\nthe corresponding eigenvalue problem.\nAlternatively, one can recover the coefficients by demanding that the wavefunction |\u03a8i has the desired symmetries. In other words, one can work with projectors.\nIn general, one can construct the so-called \"transfer\"\noperators28,29\nj\nP\u0302\u03bb\u03ba\n=\n\nlj X j \u22c6\n\u0393 (g)\u03bb\u03ba \u011d,\nh g\n\n(6)\n\nwhere h is the order of the group G, lj is the dimension of the irreducible representation \u0393j , and \u0393j (g)\u03bb\u03ba is\nthe element in the \u03bb-th row and \u03ba-th column of the matrix associated with \u011d in such irreducible representation.\nThis operator yields zero unless the function on which it\nacts belongs to the \u03ba-th row of \u0393j . By using the great\northogonality theorem one can show that\nj\nk\nk\n,\nP\u0302\u03bb\u03ba\nP\u0302\u03bc\u03bd\n= \u03b4jk \u03b4\u03ba\u03bc P\u0302\u03bb\u03bd\nj \u2020\n(P\u0302\u03bb\u03ba\n)\n\n=\n\nj\nP\u0302\u03ba\u03bb\n\n(7)\n(8)\n\nj\nIt is easy to see that P\u0302\u03ba\u03ba\nis indeed a projection operator in\nthe mathematical sense: it is Hermitian and idempotent.\nj\nConsider the action of P\u0302\u03ba\u03ba\non a deformed wavefunction\n|\u03a6i.

Observe that all projected wavefunctions of the same irreducible representation \u0393j are degenerate.\nWe have used the above projections to restore spatial\nsymmetry. On the other hand, we have preferred to diagonalize the Hamiltonian in the basis of the elements of\n\u02c6 K\u0302} to restore complex conjugation. Restorthe group {I,\ning complex conjugation amounts to letting the resulting\n|\u03a8i have the property that\nK\u0302|\u03a8i = ei\u03c7 |\u03a8i,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u03c7 is an arbitrary phase factor. Note that a general\ncomplex deformed HF determinant does not have this\nproperty.\n\nB.\n\nSpin Projection Operators\n\nDue to the historical significance of spin projection,\nwe here present a more detailed discussion of the form\nwe use.\nWe can recover eigenfunctions of \u015c 2 by demanding that\nthe projected wavefunction be invariant to the axis of\nspin quantization, as first proposed by Percus and Rotenberg in the context of angular momentum projection.30\nThe form we use for the spin projection operator is similar to the one we discussed for non-abelian groups in the\npreceding section. Explicitly, we use the operator\ns\nP\u0302mk\n= |s; mihs; k|\nZ\n2s + 1\ns\u22c6\n=\nd\u03a9 Dmk\n(\u03a9) R\u0302(\u03a9),\n8\u03c0 2\n\nR\u0302(\u03a9) = ei\u03b1\u015cz ei\u03b2 \u015cy ei\u03b3 \u015cz ,\n\n(14)\n(15)\n(16)\n\ns\nwhere Dmk\n(\u03a9) = hs; m|R\u0302(\u03a9)|s; ki is a Wigner rotation\nmatrix and |s; mi is an eigenfunction of \u015c 2 and \u015cz with\neigenvalues denoted by s and m, respectively. Here, \u03a9 =\n(\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) is the set of Euler angles.\n\n\f4\ns\nP\u0302mk\nobeys the same rules as the transfer operators\ndiscussed previously:\n\u2032\n\ns\ns\ns\nP\u0302mk\nP\u0302m\n\u2032 k\u2032 = \u03b4ss\u2032 \u03b4m\u2032 k P\u0302mk\u2032 ,\n\u0011\u2020\n\u0010\ns\ns\n= P\u0302km\n.\nP\u0302mk\n\nSimplifying the notation by defining\nx(\u03a9) = w(\u03a9) h\u03a6|R\u0302(\u03a9)|\u03a6i\n\n(17)\n(18)\n\ns\nThe action of P\u0302mk\non a deformed HF state |\u03a6i recovers the multi-determinantal state characterized by the\nquantum numbers s and k and writes it in terms of the\nquantum numbers s and m. As discussed above, using\nsuch an operator is undesirable as the wavefunction (and\nthe energy) obtained depends on the value of k chosen.\nWe therefore form the linear combination\nX\ns\n|\u03a8i =\n|\u03a6i\n(19)\nck P\u0302mk\nk\n\nand determine the 2s + 1 coefficients ck by diagonalization.\nWe finally note that if |\u03a6i is an eigenfunction of \u015cz\nwith eigenvalue m (i.e., a collinear state), then no such\nexpansion is necessary. Furthermore, the operator becomes a true projection operator and can be simplified\nto\nZ\n2s + 1 \u03c0\ns\nP\u0302mm\n=\n(20)\nd\u03b2 sin \u03b2 dsmm (\u03b2) ei\u03b2 \u015cy ,\n2\n0\nwhere dsmm (\u03b2) = hs; m|ei\u03b2 \u015cy |s; mi. In this case, the projected wavefunctions (and their energies) depend on the\nvalue of h\u015cz i = m chosen for the deformed determinant.\nIn practice, the gauge integration over the set of Euler\nangles is discretized. We have observed that the number of grid points required to get good convergence on\nthe integrals is generally small. We should note that\nthe projectors we have described in the foregoing have\nfrequently been used for total angular momentum projection in nuclear physics.10 It should also be observed\nthat the form of the spin projector that we use is in fact\nnot new in quantum chemistry. It was used by Lefebvre\nand Prat31,32 to provide a simpler formula for the EHF\nenergy. Their work, unfortunately, remained largely unnoticed.\nTo reduce notational clutter, we will henceforth use E\nfor the energy of the projected state and will write the\nprojector in a general form as\nZ\nP\u0302 = d\u03a9 w(\u03a9) R\u0302(\u03a9).\n(21)\n\nand constructing the rotated Slater determinants\n|\u03a9i =\n\nProjected Hartree\u2013Fock\n\nGiven the projectors defined above, we evaluate the\nprojected Hartree\u2013Fock energy expression as\nR\nd\u03a9 w(\u03a9) h\u03a6|\u0124 R\u0302(\u03a9)|\u03a6i\nh\u03a6|\u0124 P\u0302 |\u03a6i\nE=\n= R\n.\n(22)\nh\u03a6|P\u0302 |\u03a6i\nd\u03a9 w(\u03a9) h\u03a6|R\u0302(\u03a9)|\u03a6i\n\nR\u0302(\u03a9)|\u03a6i\nh\u03a6|R\u0302(\u03a9)|\u03a6i\n\npermits us to write\nR\nZ\nd\u03a9 x(\u03a9) h0|\u0124|\u03a9i\nR\n= d\u03a9 y(\u03a9) h0|\u0124|\u03a9i.\nE=\nd\u03a9 x(\u03a9)\n\n(24)\n\n(25)\n\nEvaluating the energy thus requires evaluating overlap or\nnorm matrix elements h\u03a6|R\u0302(\u03a9)|\u03a6i and Hamiltonian matrix elements h0|\u0124|\u03a9i. Note that because R\u0302(0) = 1, we\nhave |0i = |\u03a6i. Note also that the determinants |\u03a9i are\ndefined in intermediate normalization, so that h0|\u03a9i = 1.\nThe norm matrix elements can be evaluated in the\nusual way for the overlap between two non-orthogonal\nSlater determinants |\u03a6i and |\u039ei:33\nh\u03a6|\u039ei = det M,\n\n(26)\n\nwhere M is the matrix of overlaps between orbitals |\u03c6i\noccupied in |\u03a6i and orbitals |\u03bei occupied in |\u039ei, i.e.\nMij = h\u03c6i |\u03bej i.\n\n(27)\n\nTo evaluate the Hamiltonian matrix elements we follow\nL\u00f6wdin,33 who realized that a generalized form of Wick's\ntheorem holds.

We have assumed\nan orthonormal basis for convenience and will continue\nto do so, but modifications for a non-orthonormal basis\nare straightforward.\nD.\n\nOptimization of the PHF Wave Function\n\nin the basis of the occupied molecular orbitals of |\u03a6i for\nwhich Cp = 1. In practical calculations, we do exactly\nthis, and the subscripts p and q denote occupied and\nvirtual orbitals, respectively.\nRecall that the overlap matrix elements are given by\nh\u03a6|R\u0302(\u03a9)|\u03a6i = det M\u03a9 .\nWe rewrite the matrix M\u03a9 as\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\u2020\nCp\nCp\nM\u03a9 =\nR\u03a9\nCq\nCq\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\u2020\nCp\nCp\nC\u2020p (C\u2020p )\u22121\nR\u03a9\n= (Cp )\u22121 Cp\nCq\nCq\n\u2020 \u22121\n= (Cp )\u22121 N\u22121\n,\n\u03a9 (Cp )\n\nAs we have written things thus far, the fundamental\nvariables are the occupied orbital coefficients C. However, because the wavefunction |\u03a6i is a single determinant, it is defined completely by its one-particle density\nmatrix \u03c1, a point brought up by L\u00f6wdin in 1966,29 when\nhe wrote\n\"Since the wavefunction P\u0302 |\u03a8i depends\nuniquely on \u03c1, the main problem in the projected Hartree\u2013Fock scheme is to vary \u03c1 so\nthat the energy becomes an absolute minimum.\"\n\n\u03c1 = CC\u2020\n\n(35)\n\nwhere we recall that C is the matrix of coefficients defining the occupied orbitals. Let us partition this matrix in\nthe form\n\u0012 \u0013\nCp\nC=\n(36)\nCq\nwhere Cp is N \u00d7 N and Cq is (M \u2212 N ) \u00d7 N .

We require that Cp have nonvanishing determinant. We can always find a partitioning\nsatisfying this requirement because we can choose to work\n\n(40a)\n(40b)\n(40c)\n\nwhere\nN\u03a9 =\n\n\u0014\n\n\u03c1pp \u03c1pq\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0012 \u0013\u0015\u22121\n\u03c1pp\n.\nR\u03a9\n\u03c1qp\n\n(41)\n\nThen we can write the overlap matrix elements explicitly\nin terms of \u03c1 as\nh\u03a6|R\u0302(\u03a9)|\u03a6i =\n\nThe minimization of the energy with respect to \u03c1 would\nbe greatly facilitated if we were able to write an explicit\ndensity matrix functional E[\u03c1]. Our task here is thus to\nobtain this energy functional, in a manner analogous to\nthe work of Sheikh and Ring for projected Hartree\u2013Fock\u2013\nBogoliubov.17 Having done so, we can minimize the PHF\nenergy with respect to idempotent density matrices \u03c1.\nWe start by writing the density matrix as\n\n(39)\n\n1\n.\ndet(N\u03a9 \u03c1pp )\n\n(42)\n\nIn a similar manner, we can write the Hamiltonian\nmatrix elements, computed in terms of transition density\nmatrices, explicitly in terms of \u03c1. The transition density\nmatrices are formed as\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\u2020\nCp\nCp\nM\u22121\n\u03c1\u03a9 = R \u03a9\n.\n(43)\n\u03a9\nCq\nCq\nSimple manipulations bring us to\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0001\n\u03c1pp\nN\u03a9 \u03c1pp \u03c1pq .\n\u03c1\u03a9 = R \u03a9\n\u03c1qp\n\n(44)\n\nHaving expressed the overlap and Hamiltonian matrix\nelements as functionals of \u03c1, we have all the ingredients\nwe need to write a closed-form expression for the projected energy in terms of \u03c1, which we recall is the density\nmatrix of the deformed (unprojected) state |\u03a6i. We can\nthen set up a variational problem similar to that of the\nregular Hartree\u2013Fock procedure. We simply write\n\u03b4{E[\u03c1] \u2212 Tr[\u039b(\u03c12 \u2212 \u03c1)]} = 0,\n\n(45)\n\nwhere \u039b is a matrix of Lagrange multipliers used to constrain \u03c1 to remain idempotent so that |\u03a6i remains a single determinant. This variational ansatz is equivalent to\nthe condition that\n[F , \u03c1] = 0,\n\n(46)\n\nwhere F is an effective Fock matrix given by\nFkl =\n\n\u2202\nE[\u03c1].\n\u2202\u03c1lk\n\n(47)\n\n\f6\nWe provide explicit expressions for the matrix elements\nof F in the appendix.\nEquation 46 can be solved by what we may call the\nPHF eigenvalue equations\nF C = C\u01eb\n\n(48)\n\nwhere \u01eb is a (diagonal) matrix of orbital energies and C\nhere corresponds to the full matrix of orbital coefficients\n(including virtual orbitals). We use the eigenvectors C of\nF to construct a new guess of the density matrix \u03c1, just\nas in standard Hartree\u2013Fock. We remind the reader that\nthese equations have been here derived in the special case\nof an orthonormal basis and must be modified slightly in\nthe case of a general non-orthogonal basis.\nThus, the optimization of the projected Hartree\u2013Fock\nstate uses the following algorithm:\n1. Construct an initial broken symmetry guess for |\u03a6i\nand form \u03c1.\n2. Compute the overlap matrix elements h\u03a6|R\u0302(\u03a9)|\u03a6i\nand form the function y(\u03a9).\n3. Form the transition density matrices \u03c1\u03a9 and contract them with one- and two-electron integrals to\nevaluate the Hamiltonian matrix elements h0|\u0124|\u03a9i.\n4. Form the effective Fock matrix F and diagonalize it to obtain new eigenvectors and thence a new\ndensity matrix \u03c1.\n5. Test for convergence. If the density matrix is not\nconverged, return to step 2.\nAt any time the energy can be evaluated from\nZ\nE = d\u03a9 y(\u03a9) h0|\u0124|\u03a9i.\n\n(49)\n\nWe emphasize that the scaling of our PHF implementation with respect to system size is the same as that\nof Hartree\u2013Fock. At each gauge point \u03a9, we form an\neffective one-body Hamiltonian F \u03a9 by contracting twoelectron integrals with transition density matrices (whose\nformation is trivial). Having formed F by integrating F \u03a9\nover the gauge angle \u03a9, we obtain a new reference determinant by diagonalizing F . While the cost of our PHF\nprocedure is moderately higher than that of Hartree\u2013\nFock because we must integrate over the gauge angle, this\nintegration generally does not require too many points\nand is trivially parallelizable in any event. Reference\n1 establishes that the size of the gauge integration grid\nneeded scales only weakly with the size of the system.\nIt is important to note that the Brillouin-like condition of Eqn. 46 defines only the occupied-virtual part of\nthe effective Hamiltonian F , just as in standard Hartree\u2013\nFock theory. When working in the molecular orbital basis as we do, this corresponds to defining F pq and F qp .\nThe occupied-occupied and virtual-virtual parts of F are\nnot defined by the Brillouin condition; accordingly, without further modifications the entire effective Hamiltonian\n\nvanishes at convergence. In order to cleanly separate occupied and virtual orbitals and thereby ensure efficient\nconvergence, the occupied-occupied and virtual-virtual\nparts must be defined as well. We therefore define the\noccupied-occupied and virtual-virtual parts of F to be\nthe corresponding parts of F, the standard Fock operator\nconstructed from the density matrix \u03c1. In the molecular orbital basis, this corresponds to defining F pp = Fpp\nand F qq = Fqq ; in a general basis, this corresponds to\nwriting F \u2192 F + \u03c1F\u03c1 + (1 \u2212 \u03c1)F(1 \u2212 \u03c1). This ad hoc\nchoice has proven to be efficient and reliable thus far but\nis not guaranteed to work in all cases. One should note\nthat the orbital energies from our PHF equations do not\nhave obvious physical meaning.\n\nE.\n\nNomenclature\n\nBefore we discuss our results, let us briefly clarify the\nnomenclature we use in this manuscript.\nWe will use PUHF for spin projection on the unrestricted Hartree\u2013Fock (UHF) in a projection after variation manner. We write SUHF (equivalent to the standard spin-projected EHF) for variation after spin projection on a determinant which breaks \u015c 2 symmetry and\nSGHF for variation after spin projection on a determinant which breaks both \u015c 2 and \u015cz symmetry. We can\nalso break complex conjugation symmetry (see Ref. 1)\nto form KUHF, KGHF, KSUHF, or KSGHF, where KSGHF, for example, means that we restore complex conjugation symmetry as well as \u015c 2 and \u015cz . Similarly, we\ncan restore point group symmetry to form, for instance,\nC2 -SUHF, which restores \u015c 2 and makes the wavefunction\ntransform as one of the irreducible representations of the\ngroup C2 .\nIII.\n\nRESULTS\n\nOur PHF equations have been implemented in the\nGaussian34 program package. For this pilot work, we\nwill generally be interested in spin projection in small\nsystems with small basis sets, though we also consider\ncomplex conjugation and point group symmetry breaking and restoration. Larger systems with larger basis\nsets are certainly feasible, as the method has the same\ncomputational scaling as Hartree\u2013Fock.\nIn order to construct an initial guess for the deformed\ndeterminant, we typically start with a broken-symmetry\nHartree\u2013Fock state. This is usually straightforward in\nthe case of SUHF, but is often challenging for SGHF\nsince GHF solutions different from rotated UHF are not\ncommon for first row molecules.35 We therefore mix the\n\u2191-spin and \u2193-spin orbitals closest to the Fermi level with\nsome predefined angle small enough so as not to raise the\nenergy significantly but large enough so as not to return\nto UHF. Similarly, to break complex conjugation symmetry, we mix the highest occupied orbital and the lowest\n\n\f7\n\nA.\n\nMolecular Dissociation\n\nWe start by examining the effects of projection on\nmolecular dissociation curves. All calculations in this section use the cc-pVDZ basis set,39 unless otherwise stated.\nAs is well known, restricted Hartree\u2013Fock (RHF) fails\nfor the dissociation of H2 , separating to an equal mix\nof two hydrogen atoms on the one hand and a hydrogen\ncation plus a hydrogen anion on the other. The energetically correct dissociation limit is recovered by breaking spin and spatial symmetry in UHF. The resulting\nwavefunction is a linear combination of singlet and triplet\nand is thus spin contaminated. Restoring spin symmetry variationally leads to the SUHF wavefunction, which\nlike UHF is energetically exact at dissociation but unlike\nUHF retains good quantum numbers along the whole potential energy curve. Near equilibrium, SUHF and UHF\ndiffer significantly, as can be seen in Fig. 1. Breaking and\nrestoring symmetry under K\u0302 or \u015cz variationally improves\nthe results near equilibrium even further.\nWhile PHF yields excellent results for the dissociation\nof H2 , it misses some of the effects of dynamical correla-\n\n\u22120.80\n\u22120.85\n\u22120.90\nEnergy (EH)\n\nvirtual orbital with complex coefficients, thereby breaking complex conjugation symmetry, and we use an analogous procedure to break point group symmetry where\nwe must take care to mix orbitals belonging to different\nirreducible representations of the point group we wish\nto restore. Convergence is usually enhanced by the use\nof the Direct Inversion of the Iterative Subspace (DIIS)36\nprocedure which ideally does not start until the energy of\nthe projected state is below the energy of the symmetryadapted HF state. In other words, SUHF projecting onto\nan overall singlet state should not start DIIS until the energy is lower than the RHF energy, simply because the\nRHF wavefunction is a solution of the SUHF equations.\nOur first order of business is to verify that our SUHF\nmethod reproduces previous EHF results. Unfortunately,\nthere are relatively few calculations available in the literature. Nonetheless, we have verified that we reproduce results from Rosenberg and Martino15 and Klimo\nand Tin\u0306o16 . Recently, Karadakov and Cooper performed\nself-consistent projected UHF calculations based on the\nspin-coupled valence bond theory.37 Because they worked\nwithin the SCVB framework, Karadakov and Cooper\nchose to keep a set of core orbitals which remained doubly occupied and symmetry adapted.

The projected HF methods generally go to a dissociation limit slightly below\nthat of UHF. Near equilibrium, breaking and restoring\ncomplex conjugation symmetry accounts for most of the\ncorrelation available in CASSCF(10/8), though KRHF\ndissociates to a limit much too high. Spin projection to\ngive SUHF or SGHF is comparable to complex conjugation projection at dissocation, but generally inferior at\nequilibrium. Combining the two in KSUHF and KSGHF\ngives energies below the (variational) CASSCF. All of\nthese curves, however, are far above the coupled cluster\nsingles and doubles (CCSD) based on the UHF reference,\neven with this small basis set. It is interesting to note\nthat the KSGHF solution nearly parallels the UCCSD\nsolution; the non-parallelity error (maximum deviation\n\u2212 minimum deviation) is 8 kcal/mol.\nA second illustration of the missing dynamical correlation is provided by considering the dissociation of H3 .\nHere, we arrange the three atoms on the corners of an\nequilateral triangle and expand the triangle symmetrically. The Hartree\u2013Fock ground state in this case is noncollinear (i.e. is an eigenfunction of neither \u015c 2 nor \u015cz ).\nFigure 5 shows the dissociation, projecting onto s = 1/2.\nEven in this simple three-electron system, the spin projection clearly misses a significant portion of the total\ncorrelation.\nAn application of spatial symmetry restoration is provided in Fig. 6, where the isotropic expansion of a square\nof hydrogen atoms is shown. We have performed these\ncalculations with an uncontracted STO-6G basis set, and\nwe have restored point group symmetry in the framework\nof the abelian C4 subgroup of the full D4h symmetric\ngroup. In particular, the lowest energy C4 -SUHF solution corresponds to B symmetry. One can observe that\nsymmetry breaking and restoration of the point group\nof the molecule provides additional correlation energy to\nSUHF, though the improvements relative to SUHF de-\n\n\f8\n\u2212108.0\n\n\u2212108.0\nRHF\nUHF\nSUHF\nSGHF\nCAS\nUCCSD\n\nEnergy (EH)\n\n\u2212108.4\n\u2212108.6\n\n\u2212108.4\n\n\u2212108.8\n\n\u2212108.8\n\u2212109.0\n\n\u2212109.2\n\n\u2212109.2\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\nR (a0)\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n\u2212109.4\n\n5\n\nFIG. 2.

In the case of SGHF, all these states\nare degenerate, as they should be. This degeneracy is\nlost with SUHF, but a SUHF state can be found for each\npair of quantum numbers (s, m). Figure 7 shows the dissociation of O2 to the singlet and the m = 0 and m = \u00b11\ntriplets, computed with a minimal (STO-3G) basis. The\nUHF dissociation on the triplet (more precisely, on the\nm = 1) curve is qualitatively right at equilibrium but\nhas a bump before breaking spatial symmetry and dissociating from above. The lowest energy UHF solution\nat dissociation has m = 0. We have two different SUHF\ncurves for s = 1. The m = 1 curve is qualitatively reasonable near equilibrium and has no bump, but goes to a\nlimit above the UHF curve for the same m.

The m = 0\nfollows the UHF \"singlet\" and is more correct at dissociation. Note that while SGHF has the attractive feature\nof making all components for a given spin state degenerate, finding SGHF solutions is technically demanding,\nin part because GHF solutions are generally unavailable\nbut also because there are sometimes multiple SGHF solutions similar in energy.\nAnother interesting aspect that has not been thoroughly studied in the literature before is the basis set\ndependence of the correlation energy recovered by projection methods. In Fig. 8, we show the difference of\nthe SUHF, KSUHF, and CASSCF(10,8) energies with\nrespect to UHF as a function of the internuclear separation with basis sets of increasing size.

This suggests that the correlations we recover are mostly static in nature.\nB.\n\n6\n\nIn principle, a spin-projected Hartree\u2013Fock method\ncould be made size consistent with the aid of local projection operators. That is, suppose we wish to dissociate a\nmolecule to fragments A and B. Writing |\u03a6A i (|\u03a6B i) for\nthe broken symmetry reference for fragment A (fragment\nB), we could imagine writing\n\n\u2212147.55\n\n\u2212147.70\n\n1.5\n\nSize Consistency\n\nWhat is not so clear from the dissociation curves we\nhave shown is that projected Hartree\u2013Fock is not usually size consistent. The magnitude of the error may be\nfairly large. For example, the KSUHF dissociation limit\nof N2 is roughly 27 mH (17 kcal/mol) higher than twice\nthe KSUHF energy of the nitrogen atom, with comparable errors for KUHF and SUHF. The origin of this size\ninconsistency is simply that SUHF on N2 demands that\nthe entire system be a singlet, but does not independently\nproject any particular spin component onto the individual nitrogen atoms, which should each be a quartet.\n\n(50)\n\nwhere P\u0302A and P\u0302B are projection operators which restore\nsymmetry only on the individual (noninteracting) fragments, and P\u0302AB subsequently restores symmetry on the\nwhole system. We could, for example, dissociate O2 to\ntwo triplet oxygen atoms with the aid of P\u0302A and P\u0302B , and\nput the whole system into a spin triplet via P\u0302AB . This\nwavefunction is explicitly size consistent.\nWhile formally this looks like projection operators acting on a broken symmetry determinant to restore symmetry, this approach lies outside the conventional PHF\nframework because we have relied on local projectors P\u0302A\nand P\u0302B in addition to a global projector P\u0302AB . Unfortunately, it is far from clear how best to define such local\nprojectors except for noninteracting subsystems. The relation between the method sketched above and PHF is\nclosely akin to the relation between AGP (which is not\nsize consistent) and the size consistent Antisymmetrized\nPower of Strongly Orthogonal Geminals40 wherein one\ncreates orthogonal subsets of orbitals and introduces\ngeminals which pair orbitals only within a subset.\nC.\n\nThe Curse of the Thermodynamic Limit\n\nWe have already seen that projected HF is not size\nconsistent. Neither is it size extensive. We demonstrate\n\n\f10\nthis by examining equally spaced rings of hydrogen atoms\nwith an internuclear distance of 1.8 bohr. As the number\nof atoms in the ring gets large, the ring approaches a\nperiodic chain. All calculations are done in the STO-6G\nbasis set and for an overall spin singlet state.\nIn Fig. 9 we show the energy per atom as a function\nof the ring size. While for small rings UHF, PUHF, and\nSUHF all differ noticeably, the three curves converge to\nthe same energy per atom as the rings become large. Figure 9 also shows that as the number of particles becomes\nlarge, both PUHF and SUHF give the same improvement\nin total energy over UHF. In other words, both PUHF\nand SUHF provide the same correlation energy relative\nto UHF, (about 140 mH), but the physically meaningful correlation energy per particle vanishes for large N .\nThis observation was made by Mayer and Kert\u00e9sz27 and\nby Casta\u00f1o and Karadakov26 in a PPP model of finite\npolyene chains, and our results show the behavior they\ndescribed. In the limit N \u2192 \u221e, where N is the number\nof particles, restoring spin symmetry has no effect on the\nenergy per particle. This is what we mean when we say\nthat projected Hartree\u2013Fock is not size extensive.\nThe rationale behind the failure of projected methods\nto go beyond broken symmetry mean-field theory in the\nthermodynamic limit is as follows. For finite systems,\nthe energy lowering due to projection comes about from\nthe fact that the matrix elements h\u03a6|\u0124 R\u0302|\u03a6i and h\u03a6|R\u0302|\u03a6i\nare non-zero, where R\u0302 are rotation matrices, as explained\nin Section II. As the system size increases, those matrix\nelements tend to zero. If they are zero, then the Hamiltonian becomes diagonal in the basis of the rotated states,\nand thus there is no chance for energy lowering to occur.\nIn other words, the Goldstone manifold (defined in Ref.\n1) remains degenerate but becomes non-interacting.\n\nD.\n\nSinglet-Triplet Splittings\n\nSpin splittings (the difference in energy between the\nlowest energy states of various spins s) are important\nquantities in both organic and inorganic chemistry. They\nare connected to magnetic coupling constants in the\nHeisenberg Hamiltonian, and can be unfortunately challenging to evaluate with simple mean-field methods.\nDensity functional theory is well known to have difficulties with spin splittings, and unrestricted Hartree\u2013Fock\n(UHF) also often fails, particularly when spin contamination is large.41\nOne can attempt to remedy the failings of UHF by projecting the UHF wavefunction onto spin eigenfunctions\n(that is, to use a PAV approach), but in many cases this\nprojected UHF is still inadequate. The question we wish\nto address here is whether variation after projection in\nour PHF scheme offers more accurate results. We will\nfocus on singlet-triplet splittings, as they are the most\ncommonly studied.\nIn Table I we show the computed singlet-triplet splittings for a variety of small diatomic molecules,42 as well\n\nas methylene (CH2 ),43 trimethylmethane (TMM),44 and\no-, m-, and p-benzyne.45 All calculations use the ccpVTZ basis set, and we define the singlet-triplet splittings as simply\n\u2206EST = ET \u2212 ES\n\n(51)\n\nwhere ET and ES are the energies of the triplet and\nthe singlet states, respectively. We have included results\nusing CUHF, taken from Ref. 5. In CUHF, a triplet\nstate is obtained by optimizing the HF determinant subject to the constraint that it remains a spin eigenfunction. For singlet states, CUHF allows symmetry breaking\nonly between two orbitals. PCUHF corresponds to spinprojection on CUHF performed with a PAV approach.\nFor the small diatomic molecules, both SUHF and\nPUHF provide excellent agreement with experiment. As\nthe systems become larger (but not too large; see above)\nSUHF and PUHF differ more, and SUHF is more accurate. Generally, we observe that spin projection yields\nmeaningful improvements when the spin contamination\nin the UHF is large only for the singlet state, but has less\nto offer when the UHF has significant spin contamination\nin both the singlet and triplet states. This is demonstrated by the benzynes, where SUHF, though more\naccurate than UHF or PUHF, is still far from experiment. Complex conjugation restoration has, as one might\nexpect, much smaller effects on the calculated singlettriplet splittings. We should point out that dynamic correlation can have large effects on calculated singlet-triplet\nsplittings which cannot be captured by SUHF and SGHF\nas these methods account primarily for static correlation.\nNote that semi-empirical corrections to calculated\nsinglet-triplet splittings with spin contaminated wavefunctions such as UHF and KUHF can be extracted as,\nfor example,46\u201348\n\u2206EST = 2\n\nET \u2212 ES\nh\u015c 2 iT\n\n\u2212 h\u015c 2 iS\n\n(52)\n\nwhere ET and ES are the energies of the spin contaminated triplet and singlet determinants and h\u015c 2 iT and\nh\u015c 2 iS are the respective expectation values of \u015c 2 . If the\nwavefunctions used are spin eigenfunctions, Eqn. 52 reduces to Eqn. 51. While the results for spin contaminated states are closer to experiment, the prescription\nis neither unique nor first principles. Applying this correction to KUHF leads to a MAE of 10.1 kcal/mol, still\nworse than KSUHF.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nSymmetries and good quantum numbers are of critical importance in many finite quantum systems. Unfortunately, approximate variational solutions to the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation need not respect the same symmetries as does the exact solution.

Here, we\ndo the same when the reference determinant conserves\nelectron number. There are two reasons to present this\nnew set of PHF equations. First, due to the historical\nsignificance of the PHF problem in quantum chemistry.\nSecond, the PQT equations as presented before lead to\nindeterminancies for systems whose deformed reference\nstate has exact zero occupations, as is the case when\nparticle number symmetry is not broken. The pairing interaction in PQT assigns a non-zero occupation to every\nnatural orbital, but in practice the occupation numbers\nmay become sufficiently small in a large enough basis\nthat the equations cannot be accurately solved in double\n\n\f12\nprecision arithmetic. The ideas presented here can be\nextended to remedy this deficiency.\nThe PHF formulation here presented is easy to\ncode and numerically robust. The resulting projected\nHartree\u2013Fock scheme is conceptually simple and computationally affordable, and generally leads to good quality multireference wavefunctions. Size consistency and\nsize extensivity remain problems, but otherwise projected\nHartree\u2013Fock offers a relatively black box treatment of\nstrong correlation while staying within the mean-field\npicture without sacrificing good quantum numbers.\nV.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work is supported by the National Science Foundation under CHE-0807194 and CHE-1110884, the Welch\nFoundation (C-0036), and Los Alamos National Labs\n(Subcontract 81277-001-10).\nAppendix A: The PHF Effective Hamiltonian\n\nHere, we provide the explicit expressions required to\nevaluate the matrix elements of the effective Fock matrix.\nThe PHF energy expression can be conveniently written\nas\n\u001a\n\u001b\nZ\n1\nE = d\u03a9 y(\u03a9) Tr[h \u03c1\u03a9 ] + Tr[G\u03a9 \u03c1\u03a9 ]\n(A1)\n2\nwhere h is the matrix of one-electron integrals and G\u03a9\nis\nX\n(G\u03a9 )ik =\nhij||kli(\u03c1\u03a9 )lj .\n(A2)\njl\n\nThe effective Fock matrix is defined in terms of derivatives of the PHF energy expression with respect to matrix\nelements of the density matrix (of the deformed state) as\nFkl =\n\n\u2202\nE[\u03c1].\n\u2202\u03c1lk\n\n(A3)\n\nF is Hermitian by construction, that is,\n\u2217\nFlk\n=\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\nE[\u03c1] = Fkl .\nE[\u03c1] =\n\u2202\u03c1\u2217kl\n\u2202\u03c1lk\n\n(A4)\n\nThe derivation of the matrices Y\u03a9 and F is straightforward but cumbersome.

These matrices are correctly understood as\nM \u00d7 M , padded to the right or below by zeroes. The fact\nthat (F \u03a9 )qq and (Y \u03a9 )qq vanish is simply a consequence\nof the fact that the energy is independent of \u03c1qq .\nIn the molecular orbital basis of |\u03a6i in which we work\nin practice, we have\n!\n1 0\n\u03c1=\n.\n(A11)\n0 0\nThe subscripts p and q here will be replaced by o and\nv to emphasize that they denote occupied and virtual\norbitals, respectively.
