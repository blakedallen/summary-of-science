The coefficients, Gij and C0 , are specified by the\nparticular model of choice. Eq. (1) is a stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the diffusion type, where dWi (t)\nis an isotropic Wiener process3 and the overbar denotes\nthe ensemble average.\nEq. (1) is used to represent the probability density\nfunction (PDF) of velocity. In PDF methods4 a transport equation is solved for the joint PDF of several flow\nvariables. In most cases the equation is of Fokker-Plancktype and its numerical solution amounts to following a\nlarge number of Lagrangian particles in a Monte-Carlo\nfashion, whose properties are governed by an equivalent\nsystem of SDEs, such as Eq. (1) for the particle velocity. These computational particles do not correspond to\nreal fluid particles, but the statistics of an ensemble are\nrepresentative of the local statistical behavior of the flow\n\nover many realizations.\n\nA.\n\nVariable-density pressure-gradient-driven\nturbulence\n\nOur goal is to extend Eq. (1) to variable-density (VD)\npressure-gradient-driven turbulence (PGDT), a class of\nflows that is fundamentally different from constantdensity shear-driven flows. A classical example of PGDT\nis the Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability of an interface\nbetween two fluids of different densities in a gravitational field that points to the opposite of the density\ngradient.5\u20137 RT flows are important in several geophysical, astrophysical and engineering applications.\nBoussinesq limit. If the densities of the mixing fluids are commensurate, PGDT is treated in the Boussinesq limit: the density fluctuations are small compared\nto the mean density and are only important in the body\nforce term of the Navier-Stokes equation. A discussion of\nRT-turbulence in the Boussinesq case, with a self-similar\nanalysis at the second moment level, is given by Ristorcelli and Clark.8\nVariable-density case. In situations where the fluids\nhave vastly different densities the term variable-density is\n\n\f2\n\nLA-UR 10-05227, v0.9, Accepted in Journal of Turbulence, Jan 7, 2011\n\nused to distinguish it from the Boussinesq case. A commonly used measure of VD effects is the Atwood number,\nA=\n\n\u033a2 \u2212 \u033a1\n\u033a2 + \u033a1\n\n=\u21d2\n\n\u033a2\n1+A\n=\n,\n\u033a1\n1\u2212A\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u033a1 < \u033a2 denote the constant densities of the pure\nfluids in a binary mixture. A \u2248 0 corresponds to the\nBoussinesq case, while A \u2192 1 to largely disparate species\ndensities, \u033a1 \u226a \u033a2 . Mixing at high Atwood numbers,\ncompared to the Boussinesq case, is accompanied by several new effects: (1) the advection term in the NavierStokes equation gives rise to cubic non-linearities, (2) additional non-linearities in the molecular diffusion terms,\n(3) a dynamic mean pressure gradient, and (4) the asymmetry of the mixing layer. In these flows the mean specific volume becomes an important independent variable.\nAs a consequence of these new phenomena both hydrodynamics and mixing exhibit qualitatively different behavior compared to the Boussinesq case.9\u201313\nChallenges associated with VD-PGDT. The\nabove description highlights the tight coupling of the\ndensity and velocity fields in VD flows. This poses\nunique challenges, compared to classical (and more extensively researched) constant-density shear-driven turbulence. They can be enumerated as follows:\n1. Mixing-driven: The hydrodynamics of VD-PGDT\nmay primarily be driven by material mixing. Beside mean deformation a dominant production\nmechanism of turbulent kinetic energy is due to the\njoint effects of non-uniform fluid concentrations and\npressure gradients. The (stochastic) density field is\nan active scalar in the momentum equation.\n2. Turbulence asymmetry: At high Atwood numbers\nthe mixing process becomes asymmetric. Fluid\nparticles representing different instantaneous density (and thus different inertia) respond very differently to pressure gradients.12 As a consequence,\nin a homogeneous Rayleigh-Taylor flow an initially\nsymmetric density distribution quickly develops a\nsizeable skewness.9,10 Similarly, the non-Boussinesq\nbehavior of the pressure leads to asymmetry in\nthe profiles of the mean velocity and the turbulent\nkinetic energy across inhomogeneous RT mixing\nlayers.13 In contrast the Boussinesq case remains\nsymmetric.\n3. Non-equilibrium: The flow evolution is highly nonequilibrium as the production-to-dissipation ratio\nranges from hundreds to nearly zero.9\n4. Transitional: The Rayleigh-Taylor mixing layer\ntransitions to fully developed turbulence starting\nfrom a quiescent state.\n5. Non-stationary: At no point in time can the flow\nbe deemed statistically stationary.\n\n6. Anisotropic: Due to the large external acceleration\nforce, anisotropy is important at both large and\nsmall scales.11\nThe fundamental physics of the flow evolution must be\ncaptured at several different stages. As an example, in an\ninhomogeneous Rayleigh-Taylor flow,11,14 two pure fluids\nare initially separated by a thin perturbed interface in a\nquiescent state: the heavy fluid lies on top of the light\none with gravity acting downwards. Due to the unstable configuration, bubbles and spikes grow and penetrate\ninto each other in a laminar stage, which then break up\ninto smaller Kelvin-Helmholtz-like eddies. The flow transitions into a fully developed turbulent mixing layer with\nits width growing as long as pure fluid is entrained at the\nedges. Another example is the homogeneous RayleighTaylor mixing layer,9,10 in which the process starts from\na quiescent state with random blobs of two pure fluids (in\na closed computational box), corresponding to the center\nof an inhomogeneous RT layer. Potential energy is gradually converted to kinetic energy during transition to a\nfully developed turbulent state. After reaching a peak in\nkinetic energy, a viscous decay due to small scale dissipation ensues.\nModeling challenges of VD turbulence. From\nthe viewpoint of statistical turbulence modeling the main\nchallenges are:\n\u2022 To devise a mutually consistent representation for\nhydrodynamics and mixing. The model must correctly take into account the effect of the active\nscalar, the density, on the velocity field, and the\nmixing of the scalar by the turbulent velocity field.\n\u2022 To represent very different flow-evolutionary stages\nwithin the same method. The model must evolve\nthe flow from a quiescent initial condition through\nan initially laminar stage, via the highly non-linear\nprocess of transition to fully developed turbulence,\nfollowed by a possible decay if pure fluids are no\nlonger entrained.\n\u2022 To provide a higher level statistical description than\ncurrent VD moment closures. We require the\nmodel to predict the full one-point one-time probability distribution function of the active mixing\nfield (the density), due to its fundamental role in\nmixing-driven VD flows.\n\u2022 To formulate a simple method that captures the essentials. The numerical method must be computationally inexpensive, so that it can be used as an\nengineering closure.\nPDF methods seek to compute the one-point joint\nPDF of the fluctuating flow variables. Reviews on PDF\nmethods for turbulent flows are provided by Pope,4\nKollmann,15 Dopazo16 and by Haworth.17 The most\nwidely used velocity PDF models are variants of Eq. (1):\nby specifying Gij and C0 differently several models have\n\n\fLA-UR 10-05227, v0.9, Accepted in Journal of Turbulence, Jan 7, 2011\n\ncritical ingredients and their rigorous mathematical\nconsequences will be discussed:\n\nbeen constructed (see e.g. Ref. 18) that are routinely used\ntoday in combustion simulations.17 To highlight the challenge of PDF methods for VD turbulence, the fundamental assumptions of the standard PDF methodology for\nhydrodynamics, Eq. (1), are enumerated as follows:\n\n(a) The representation of the instantaneous density field in the momentum equation, resulting\nin an appearance of the mass flux (and thus\nturbulence production) that does not require\nexplicit modeling; and,\n\n1. Uniform-density formulation. Eq. (1) has originally been developed for constant-density flows,\n\u033a0 = const. In low-speed combustion the fluid density is treated as a function of the species concentrations and temperature, \u033a = \u033a(y, T ), and the mean\ndensity, \u033a, is used in place of \u033a0 . This non-constant,\nbut from the viewpoint of the momentum equation\nstill uniform-density case, does not take direct effects of a stochastic variable density field on the\nparticle momentum into account. This is most easily seen in the pressure-gradient term of Eq. (1) and\nless directly in the other two terms which will be\ndiscussed in more detail.\n2. Small scale isotropy. With the isotropic stochastic diffusion term, \u03b4ij dWj , Eq. (1) adheres to\nKolmogorov's hypothesis of local isotropy by construction.\nSituations where the hypothesis is\nknown to fail are non-equilibrium, highly-distorted,\nmoderate-Re or VD flows. The fluctuating velocity\nfield in these cases may exhibit significant level of\nanisotropy at the small scales.13,19,20\n3. Fully developed turbulence. Eq. (1) assumes a fully\ndeveloped, i.e. high-Re, flow with isotropic inertial\nrange scaling.1\nThe above general discussion makes it clear that developing a PDF model for VD flows is a largely unexplored\nterritory. Due to the wide variety of challenges associated with non-stationary variable-density flows, the development is documented in a series of three papers, as\ndescribed in the following subsection. This article is the\nsecond in the series.\n\n(b) The introduction of a new tensorial stochastic diffusion term representing small scale\nanisotropy.\n3. Joint PDF model specification and validation. The\nstrongly coupled nature of active material mixing\nand hydrodynamics in VD-PGDT will require a\njoint model. This is the subject of a forthcoming article,21 which will combine the ideas about\nmixing and hydrodynamics into a comprehensive\nmodeling framework.\n\nC.\n\nNavier-Stokes equation for variable-density flow\n\nIt seems appropriate to specify, at the outset, the dynamic level of hydrodynamical approximation that is to\nbe modeled.\nWe consider variable-density flows, where differences\nin fluid density arise solely from non-uniform mass concentrations, e.g. due to mixing of different fluids. Density variations originating from pressure and temperature\nchanges are neglected at this time, \u033a(y, p, T ) = \u033a(y).\nFor this class of variable-density flows, the NavierStokes equation, governing the instantaneous fluid particle velocity, vi , in the presence of viscous and external\nforces, is written symbolically as\n\u0001\n(3)\ndvi = gi \u2212 vp,i +\u03bcv\u22072 vi dt,\nwith the specific volume,\n\nv = 1/\u033a.\nB.\n\n3\n\n(4)\n\nObjectives of the article\n\nOur aim is to develop a model that represents the\ntemporally evolving joint PDF of density and velocity\nin variable-density pressure-gradient-driven turbulence.\nThe development is carried out in three parts:\n1. Development of a VD material mixing model. A\nprevious article,2 devoted to the density equation,\naddressed the challenges associated with active\nscalar mixing in VD flows and developed a Lagrangian stochastic equation to represent conservation of mass.\n2. Development of the Langevin model for the velocity\nfield in VD flows. The extension of the momentum\nequation from constant-density shear-driven flows\nto VD-PGDT is the subject of this paper. Two\n\nHere gi , p, \u033a and \u03bc denote the acceleration force per unit\nmass, the pressure, the density and the constant dynamic\nviscosity, respectively.

VII.\nII.\n\nREVIEW OF THE LANGEVIN MODEL FOR\nCONSTANT-DENSITY SHEAR FLOWS\n\nThis section reviews the generalized Langevin model\nand its underlying assumptions.\nDecomposing the velocity and pressure into mean\nand fluctuating parts, the Navier-Stokes equation for\nconstant-density flows, Eq. (5), takes the form\n\u0001\ndvi = gi \u2212 p,i /\u033a0 + \u03bc/\u033a0 \u22072 v i dt\n\u0001\n(6)\n+ \u2212p\u2032,i /\u033a0 + \u03bc/\u033a0 \u22072 vi\u2032 dt,\nwith the fluctuation defined as y \u2032 = y \u2212 y.\nA widely used model equation for the particle velocity, vi\u2217 , in constant-density shear flows is the generalized\nLangevin model (GLM),1\n\u0001\ndvi\u2217 = gi \u2212 p,i /\u033a0 + \u03bc/\u033a0 \u22072 v i dt\n(7)\n\u0001\n1/2\n+ Gij vj\u2217 \u2212 v j dt + (C0 \u03b5) dWi .\n\nIn the following, the star superscript (\u2217 ) will denote a\nmodel for an instantaneous quantity, such as vi\u2217 for vi .\nIn Eq. (7) Gij is a second-order tensor which, in\nshear flows, is assumed to depend on local values of the\nReynolds stress, vi\u2032 vj\u2032 , the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy, \u03b5, and the mean velocity gradient, v i,j . C0 is\na positive constant and dWi (t) is a vector-valued Wiener\nprocess3 with zero mean and covariance dWi dWj = dt\u03b4ij .\nThe statistics on the right hand side of Eq. (7) are understood to be evaluated at the particle position, x\u2217i , governed by\ndx\u2217i\n\n=\n\nvi\u2217 dt.\n\n(8)\n\nThree fundamental assumptions underly Eq. (7):\n1. The Markov property,3 which assumes that the velocity can be described by a Fokker-Planck equation and, equivalently, by a SDE, such as Eq. (7).\n\nStrictly speaking, turbulence is not a Markovian\nprocess, but the fluctuations in the inertial subrange, for which Eq. (7) has been developed, can\nbe closely approximated by Markov processes.22\n2. Linear dependence: through the linear drift term\nGij (vj\u2217 \u2212 v j )dt the effect of fluctuations of the surrounding fluid is modeled as a linear function of\nthe velocity. This is inconsistent with the quadratic\ndependence of the fluctuating pressure gradient on\nthe fluctuating velocity.15 However, linearity (as an\napproximation) may be justified by (1) the correct\nbehavior of the equation in homogeneous shear turbulence, i.e. an arbitrary velocity PDF relaxes to\na joint normal, and (2) that realizability of the\nReynolds stress tensor is automatically satisfied\nprovided that C0 is non-negative and Gij and C0\nare bounded.4,23\n3. Local isotropy: the isotropy of the diffusion term\n(C0 \u03b5)1/2 \u03b4ij dWj implies isotropy at the small scales,\nthereby ensuring consistency with Kolmogorov's\nhypothesis of local isotropy.22,24\nSince the first drift term of Eq. (7) represents the effects\nof the mean forces on the particle and the last two terms\ndo not affect the mean, the equation is consistent with\nthe mean of the Navier-Stokes equation (5).25,26 A direct\nconsequence of the linearity of the second drift term in\nvi\u2217 and the independence of vi\u2217 of the stochastic term is\nGaussianity of the joint velocity PDF.3\nComparing Eqs. (6) and (7) shows that the last two\nterms in Eq. (7) jointly model the combined effect of the\nfluctuating pressure gradient and viscous dissipation:\n\u0001\n\u2212p\u2032,i /\u033a0 + \u03bc/\u033a0 \u22072 vi\u2032 dt =\n(9)\n\u0001\n1/2\n= Gij vj\u2217 \u2212 v j dt + (C0 \u03b5) dWi .\n\nAn important consistency condition on the coefficients\nGij and C0 is1\n\u0013\n\u0012\n3\n1 + C0 \u03b5 + Gij vi\u2032 vj\u2032 = 0,\n(10)\n2\nwhich ensures that no spurious turbulent kinetic energy,\nk = vi\u2032 vi\u2032 /2, is created in homogeneous turbulence by the\nmodel. Eq. (10) is obtained from comparing the evolution\nequations that govern k in homogeneous turbulence: the\none derived from the Langevin model, Eq. (7), and the\none from the Navier-Stokes equation (5). The constraint\nin Eq. (10) ensures the same form for the k equation:\n\u2202k\n\u2202t\n\n=\nGLM\n\n\u2202k\n\u2202t\n\nNS\n\n= P \u2212 \u03b5,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere P is the shear production. The simplest way to\ndefine Gij to satisfy Eq. (10) is then\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03b5\n1 3\n+ C0\n\u03b4ij ,\n(12)\nGij = \u2212\n2 4\nk\n\n\fLA-UR 10-05227, v0.9, Accepted in Journal of Turbulence, Jan 7, 2011\nresulting in the simplified Langevin model (SLM),1 which\ncorresponds (at the Reynolds stress level) to Rotta's\nmodel of return-to-isotropy.27\nThe most important characteristics of the generalized\nLangevin model have been summarized: (1) the model\nequation is consistent with the mean Navier-Stokes equation; (2) the mathematical form accommodates Kolmogorov's hypothesis of local isotropy; (3) a realizable\nReynolds stress model is ensured, provided the coefficients satisfy certain mild conditions; and (4) the predicted joint velocity distribution is Gaussian.\nIII.\n\nA LANGEVIN MODEL FOR\nVARIABLE-DENSITY\nPRESSURE-GRADIENT-DRIVEN FLOWS\n\nThis section extends the Langevin model, Eq. (7), to\nVD-PGDT and discusses its main ingredients.\nWe propose to model the Lagrangian velocity increment in VD turbulence by\n\u0001\n\u0001\ndvi\u2217 = gi \u2212 p,i /\u033a\u2217 + \u03bc/\u033a\u2217 \u22072 v i dt + Gij vj\u2217 \u2212 hvj i dt\n1/2\n\n+ (\u03c6I \u03b5)\n\n1/2\n\ndWi + (\u03c6D \u03b5)\n\nhij dWj\u2032 ,\n\n(13)\n\nwith positive bounded tensorial diffusion hij , bounded\nfunctions \u03c6I > 0 and \u03c6D > 0, and independent Wiener\nprocesses dWi and dWj\u2032 .\nThe SDE (13) differs from (7) in three distinct ways,\nsubsequently discussed in more detail in the following\nthree subsections:\nA. Instantaneous density. Eq. (13) is intended to be\ncoupled to a stochastic equation governing the instantaneous density field, \u033a\u2217 , representing conservation of mass.\nB. Relaxation to Favre-averaged velocity. The linear relaxation term, Gij (vj\u2217 \u2212 hvj i)dt, involves the\nFavre-averaged velocity, hvi i = \u033avi /\u033a.\nC. Small scale anisotropy. A new tensorial diffusion\nterm, (\u03c6D \u03b5)1/2 hij dWj\u2032 , is introduced. The constant, C0 , in the original isotropic diffusion term\nis exchanged to \u03c6I which together with \u03c6D will be\nspecified later.\nA.\n\nInstantaneous density\n\nIn VD turbulence large density variations play a major role and, compared to the Boussinesq case, the density fluctuations can no longer be neglected in the inertia terms of the Navier-Stokes equation. Extending the\nSDE (7) to VD flows requires a representation of the\nvariable density field. Eq. (13) accomplishes this in the\nmost profitable way allowed by one-point PDF methods:\na stochastic density equation, such as discussed in Ref.\n2, is coupled at the instantaneous (particle) level.\n\n5\n\nComparing the constant-density and variable-density\nmodels, Eqs. (7) and (13), we see that in the VD case the\nparticle density, \u033a\u2217 , divides the mean pressure gradient\nand the large-scale viscous terms,\n\u2212p,i /\u033a0\n2\n\n\u03bc/\u033a0 \u2207 v i\n\n\u21d2\n\n\u21d2\n\n\u2212p,i /\u033a\u2217 ,\n\u2217\n\n2\n\n\u03bc/\u033a \u2207 v i ,\n\n(14)\n(15)\n\nwhich has the following consequences:\n\u2022 The full density PDF is coupled to the mean forces\nin the momentum equation. Since the governing\nequation for \u033a\u2217 provides the full density PDF, the\nmixing state is represented by including the effects\nof all density moments. As Ref. 21 will demonstrate, this is crucial in capturing the asymmetric\nPDF of the fluid density at high Atwood numbers.\nEqs. (14) and (15) ensure the coupling of the density PDF to (i.e. the effects of all its moments on)\nthe mean forces.\n\u2022 The effects of the mass flux on the Reynolds stress\nappear closed. As will be shown in Sec. IV, Eq. (14)\nis the key to represent the effect of the mass\nflux on the Reynolds stress in closed mathematical\nform. This is crucial in variable-density pressuregradient-driven flows, as the mass flux relates to\na primary mechanism of kinetic energy production,\nwhich in moment closures requires additional model\nequations.\nThe Navier-Stokes equation for VD flows, Eq. (3), with\nthe velocity and pressure decomposed, is\n\u0001\n\u0001\ndvi = gi \u2212 vp,i +\u03bcv\u22072 v i dt + \u2212vp\u2032,i +\u03bcv\u22072 vi\u2032 dt,\n(16)\nwhere the instantaneous specific volume, v = v + v \u2032 , is\nnot decomposed. Comparing Eqs. (13) and (16) shows\nthat the combined effects of the fluctuating pressure gradient and viscous dissipation (which now are multiplied\nby the instantaneous specific volume, v = 1/\u033a) are jointly\nmodeled as\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2212vp\u2032,i +\u03bcv\u22072 vi\u2032 dt = Gij vj\u2217 \u2212 hvj i dt\n(17)\n1/2\n1/2\n+ (\u03c6I \u03b5) dWi + (\u03c6D \u03b5) hij dWj\u2032 .\nIn other words, in Eq. (13) the last three terms are a\nmodel, while the representation of the mean forces (modulated by the instantaneous specific volume, v \u2217 = 1/\u033a\u2217 ),\ngi \u2212 p,i /\u033a\u2217 + \u03bc/\u033a\u2217 \u22072 v i , is exact. This is a consequence of\nthe availability of the one-point density PDF, represented\nhere via the instantaneous \u033a\u2217 . Although the governing\nequation of \u033a\u2217 may contain modeling,2 the coupling of\n\u033a\u2217 to the mean forces terms of the momentum SDE (13)\nis mathematically exact. As long as the joint densityvelocity PDF is valid (whose definition is discussed later)\nand the marginal density PDF ensures conservation of\nmass, the statistics involving the density, such as \u033a\u2032 vi\u2032 ,\nare finite, consistent and physically realizable. This is\n\n\f6\n\nLA-UR 10-05227, v0.9, Accepted in Journal of Turbulence, Jan 7, 2011\n\ndiscussed further in Sec. IV. In this paper, we do not\nassume a particular functional form for \u033a\u2217 , only its availability and validity. Ref. 2 discusses one choice of the\ndensity equation, which can be used in conjunction with\nEq. (13). However, we emphasize that the current development is independent of the functional form of the\ndensity model.\n\nB.\n\nRelaxation to Favre-averaged velocity\n\nComparing the constant-density and variable-density\nSDEs, (7) and (13), shows that the linear relaxation term\nin the VD case involves the Favre-average of the velocity\nfield, hvi i = \u033avi /\u033a as\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(18)\n\u21d2 Gij vj\u2217 \u2212 hvj i .\nGij vj\u2217 \u2212 v j\n\nThe same approach has been taken by Delarue & Pope28\nto develop a PDF model for high-speed compressible\nshear flows. In the application of Eq. (7) to turbulent\ncombustion relaxation to the Favre average is a standard\nprocedure. Sec. IV will show that Eq. (18) is instrumental in representing the effects of the fluctuating specific\nvolume on the mean velocity, important in mixing flows\nwith large density differences.\n\nC.\n\nSmall scale anisotropy\n\nIn high-Reynolds-number shear flows it is generally assumed that the small scales become isotropic and independent of the (anisotropic) large scales where most\nof the turbulence production takes place. Exceptions\nare strongly distorted flows20 or, as recently shown by\nLivescu & Ristorcelli,10 Livescu et al.11,13 and Chung\n& Pullin,19 the Rayleigh-Taylor mixing layer. In RT\nflows the buoyancy force has a significant effect on the\nsmallest scales, resulting in small scale anisotropy. This\nis apparent in the Reynolds stress anisotropy, bij (\u03ba\u0302) =\nvi\u2032 vj\u2032 /vk\u2032 vk\u2032 \u2212 \u03b4ij /3 at high wavenumbers \u03ba\u0302,13,19 and in the\ndissipation rate anisotropy, dij = \u03b5ij /\u03b5kk \u2212\u03b4ij /3, Ref. 10.\nThe above studies show that this is prevalent in the Atwood number range A = 0.04 \u223c 0.75. We are interested\nin the full Atwood number range of 0 < A < 1. Consequently, assuming small scale isotropy, dij \u2248 0, in such\npressure-gradient-driven flows is not justified. Accounting for the dissipation rate anisotropy is crucial in predicting the correct Reynolds stress tensor, whose budget is directly affected by dij via the small scale dissipation term \u03b5ij = 2\u03b5(dij + \u03b4ij /3), see also Eq. (36). The\nanisotropic behavior of \u03b5ij , governed by dij , is responsible for different dissipation rates of the individual components of the Reynolds stress.\nIn the constant-density model SDE (7), the small scales\nare isotropic by construction, which is built into the\nstochastic term, (C0 \u03b5)1/2 \u03b4ij dWj , in accord with Kolmogorov's hypothesis. As will be shown in Sec. IV, in the\n\nabsence of shear production, a source of (single-point)\nanisotropy in bij can be represented by an anisotropic\nspecification for Gij , while both bij (\u03ba\u0302) \u2248 0 and dij (\u03ba\u0302) \u2248 0\nat the small scales. As PGDT exhibits anisotropy at\nboth large and small scales (in both bij and dij ), the\nvariable-density velocity model, Eq. (13), relaxes the\nthird assumption implied by Eq. (7) and abandons the\nconsistency with Kolmogorov's hypothesis of small scale\nisotropy. It replaces the isotropic diffusion term by the\nsum of an isotropic and an anisotropic (tensorial) diffusion term as\n1/2\n\n1/2\n\n1/2\n\nhij dWj\u2032 .\n(19)\nThe first term in Eq. (19), proportional to \u03c6I , is designed\nto account for the effects of the isotropic part of the\nkinetic energy production/dissipation, while the second\none, proportional to \u03c6D and hij , for the effects of its deviatoric part. As will be shown in Sec. IV, Eqs. (28\u201329),\nthe stochastic diffusion terms in Eq. (19) are source/sink\nterms, depending on the sign of the given Reynolds stress\ncomponent.\nThe tensorial term in Eq. (19) is assumed to be proportional to \u03b5 = \u03b5kk /2. This is a conventional procedure\nin low-Reynolds-number flows, such as near walls,27,29\nand justified here by dij (t) being non-zero through all\nthe Rayleigh-Taylor flow evolution, see Fig. 16 in Ref.\n10. In other words, the scalar kinetic energy dissipation\nrate, \u03b5, is made anisotropic by the tensor hij in the VD\nmodel. This ensures that the small scales are anisotropic:\nthe Lagrangian velocity structure function of the process\ngoverned by Eq. (13) becomes30\n(C0 \u03b5)\n\ndWi\n\n\u21d2\n\n(\u03c6I \u03b5)\n\ndWi + (\u03c6D \u03b5)\n\nDij (s) \u2261 [vi\u2217 (t + s) \u2212 vi\u2217 (t)][vj\u2217 (t + s) \u2212 vj\u2217 (t)]\n= (\u03c6I \u03b4ij + \u03c6D hik hkj )\u03b5s,\n\n(20)\n\n\u22121\n\nwith s \u226a \u03c4 \u226a T , where \u03c4 and T \u2261 kv k,k k denote the\ntime scales of the dissipation and the mean deformation,\nrespectively. As will be shown in Sec. IV, hij , as a contribution of the small scales, provides an additional source\n(beside Gij ) in the budget of the one-point Reynolds\nstress anisotropy, bij .\nConstraints. Up to this point, the functional forms\nof the diffusion terms for VD flows, given by Eq. (19), are\nformulated based on physical insight and mathematical\nconsistency. These are:\n\u2022 Small scale anisotropy. The anisotropy of RT flows,\nindicated by both bij 6= 0 and dij 6= 0 at the small\nscales.\n1/2\n\n\u2022 Correct unit. As \u03c6I and \u03c6D hij are assumed to be\nnon-dimensional, each component\nof the diffusion\n\u221a\nterms has the unit as that of \u03b5dt.\n\u2022 Second-order tensor coefficient. The simplest way\nto introduce directional dependence into the joint\nstatistics of the fluctuating velocity components is\nto do so via the product of a second-order tensor\nand a vector-valued Wiener process.\n\n\fLA-UR 10-05227, v0.9, Accepted in Journal of Turbulence, Jan 7, 2011\nThe coefficients \u03c6I , \u03c6D and hij must be specified based\non the following considerations:\n1. Consistency with the SDE. The coefficient tensor\nshould be a square root of a symmetric and nonnegative semi-definite tensor, Hij = hik hjk . This\nis required mathematically for a SDE, such as\nEq. (13), to represent a diffusion.31\n2. Reflect the physical source of small scale anisotropy.\nThe diffusion coefficient tensor, hij , should be\na function of the given source of small scale\nanisotropy. In buoyantly driven flows this may be\nthe buoyancy force, gi , in other types of externally\naccelerated or strongly distorted flows, the body\nforce, the pressure-gradient force or the mean strain\nrates, responsible for the anisotropy. This ensures\nthat the model directly represents the effect of the\nsource of anisotropy on the small scales.\n3. Correct distribution. None of hij , \u03c6I or \u03c6D should\nbe an explicit function of the particle velocity, vi\u2217 ,\nif the Gaussianity of the joint velocity PDF is to\nbe preserved. In constant-density homogeneous\nshear flows the velocity distribution is very close to\na joint normal.32 Low-Atwood-number direct numerical simulations (DNS) show that joint Gaussianity of the velocity components is also a good\napproximation in RT flows.33 As the drift of the\nLangevin equation (7) is linear and its diffusion is\nnot an explicit function of vi\u2217 , it is an OrnsteinUhlenbeck process,3 whose statistically stationary\nsolution is a Gaussian. As an asymptotic requirement of the VD model Eq. (13), that is to reduce\nto the constant-density Langevin model, the new\ndiffusion terms should approach this attribute as a\nlimit when \u033a\u2032 \u2192 0.\n4. Asymptotic small scale isotropy. As an extension\nof the model for shear flows, the new model is required to reduce to small scale isotropy if its source\nvanishes.\n5. Correct one-point anisotropy. The combined effects\nof the new stochastic diffusion terms with \u03c6I , \u03c6D ,\nhij and Gij should be the correct level of one-point\nanisotropy in the correct components of bij .\n6. Consistent turbulent kinetic energy. Introducing\nanisotropy at the small scales must not create spurious turbulent kinetic energy. In other words, the\nkinetic energy budgets of the VD PDF model and\nof the Navier-Stokes equation must be consistent\nwith each other, similarly to Eq. (11) in constantdensity flows.\nD.\n\nSummary\n\nThe extension of the constant-density Langevin model\nto variable-density pressure-gradient-driven flows com-\n\n7\n\nprises of (1) working with the instantaneous massdensity, (2) relaxation towards the Favre mean (instead\nof the Reynolds mean) velocity, and (3) accounting for\nsmall scale anisotropy with a new tensorial diffusion term\n(instead of built-in local isotropy).\nIn the next sections we examine the equations governing the moments of the VD SDE (13). The derived moment equations are rigorous mathematical consequences\nof the particular functional form of Eq. (13), which establish constraints on the coefficients, Gij , hij , \u03c6I and\n\u03c6D , that serve as a guideline for model specification.\n\nIV.\n\nREYNOLDS MOMENT EQUATIONS\n\nTo investigate the new features of the SDE (13), and\nto aid the specification of its coefficients, the evolution\nequations for the first two moments of velocity, derived\nfrom the PDF model and the VD Navier-Stokes equation,\nare compared and examined. Here we discuss ensemble\n(or Reynolds) averaged statistics as they explicitly show\nthe effects of the density fluctuations. Sec. V discusses\nthe Favre moments.\n\nA.\n\nThe PDF transport equation\n\nThis section gives the transport equation from which\nthe equations governing the Reynolds moments are derived.\nThe equivalent Fokker-Planck equation governing the\nEulerian joint PDF of density and velocity, f (\u033a, v; x, t),\nis derived from the VD Langevin model, Eq.

(21) can be closed if a model for the dissipation rate,\n\u03b5, is specified. Such a model is given by van Slooten et\nal.34\nThe particular form of the density equation, that yields\nadditional fluxes in the density sample space in Eq. (21),\nis not important for our purposes. A density model,\nbased on the beta PDF, is given in Ref. 2. However,\nthe beta model is only one of many possibilities and thus\n\n\f8\n\nLA-UR 10-05227, v0.9, Accepted in Journal of Turbulence, Jan 7, 2011\n\nwe do not detail the functional form of the density process, \u033a\u2217 (t). Eq. (21) only signals the availability of the\ninstantaneous density field (as a sample space variable,\n\u033a) and thus the full density PDF.\nIn PDF methods, terms originating from the physical process of advection appear in closed form, thus we\nwill incorporate these in the Lagrangian derivative. As\na consequence, the derived moment equations will represent the rate of change along instantaneous Lagrangian\npaths, as specified by\n\u2202\n\u2202\nd\n.\n\u2261\n+ vk\ndt\n\u2202t\n\u2202xk\n\n(23)\n\nThis allows us to concentrate on the fundamental physics\ndue to pressure-gradient and viscous forces and their\nmodeling, separately from advection. It is worth emphasizing that the terms underlying d(*)/dt may be different\nin equations governing different statistics.\nIn a joint PDF formulation for density and velocity,\nboth Favre and Reynolds-averaged statistics can be obtained from the PDF. Variable-density flows are traditionally investigated in the Favre-averaged framework,\nin which the moment equations take a simpler form at\nthe price of concealing some effects of the density fluctuations. We work here with Reynolds-averaged statistics\nfor three reasons:\n1. With Reynolds averaging the effects of density fluctuations are made clear.\n2. All new features of the extended model can be investigated through equations for the Reynolds moments, as will be seen.\n\nFor comparison to the constant-density case, the corresponding mean velocity equation, derived from the generalized Langevin model, Eq. (7), reads\ndv i\ndt\n\nIn the following, we concentrate on the new features of\nthe extended model, Eq. (13), in VD flows where the\ndensity fluctuations are large, compared to the GLM,\nEq.

This\nis not justified in VD flows with large density fluctuations. In contrast, Eq.

Such a\ndensity model is discussed in Ref. 2.\nEq. (30) indicates that Mij vanishes in constantdensity flows, as v \u2032 = 0. Consistently, Mij = 0 in the\nconstant-density model, Eq. (29). Its appearance in the\nVD Reynolds stress budget, Eq. (28), is the consequence\nof employing the instantaneous particle density, \u033a\u2217 , in\nthe mean forces terms of the SDE (13).\nThe Favre Reynolds stress equation, derived from the\nSDE (13) and the Navier-Stokes equation (3), are discussed in Sec. V. As will be shown, in that framework\nthe effects of the mass flux in the first line of Eq.

(41) indicates that the terms in Gij and \u03b5 in the\nSDE (13) represent the combined effects of the pressurestrain correlation, turbulent transport, dissipation and\nthe triple correlations. It also shows that Mij does not\nrequire modeling. The model terms of Eq. (13), the\nones involving Gij and \u03b5, do not account for Mij , which\nappears naturally in the moment equation (28). Mij\nis the most important term that drives variable-density\npressure-gradient-driven turbulence.\nIn second-order moment closures for VD flows equations for the first two Favre moments, hvi i and hvi\u2032\u2032 vj\u2032\u2032 i,\nare solved. Since only Favre-averages are involved, it\nis necessary to separately model the normalized mass\nflux, ai = \u2212vi\u2032\u2032 , to compute its effect on the Reynolds\nstress. One such model is by Besnard et al.,35 which carries two model equations in addition to the Favre mean\nand Reynolds stress: one for ai and another one for the\ndensity-specific-volume covariance, b\u0302 = \u2212\u033a\u2032 v \u2032 , appearing\nin the equation for the mass flux, each with its burden of\nclosure assumptions. As Eqs. (30) and (32) show, in the\nPDF formulation no modeling of ai and b\u0302 is required. If\nthe joint PDF is valid, the representation of both ai and\nb\u0302 are consistent, see also Ref. 2. In the PDF framework\nmodeling is performed on the joint PDF (instead of its\nmoments), e.g. on the stochastic equations representing\n\u033a\u2217 and vi\u2217 . In the case of the SDE (13) only the effects of\nthe fluctuating pressure gradient and viscous dissipation\nare modeled, while the effects of the mean forces, from\n\n\f10\n\nLA-UR 10-05227, v0.9, Accepted in Journal of Turbulence, Jan 7, 2011\n\nwhich Mij originates, are exact, see also Eqs.

In contrast, Rayleigh-Taylor flows are anisotropic at all times at both large and small scales.9\u201311,13,19\nThese variable-density flows are at moderate Reynolds\nnumbers and free of large distortions. To this end we are\nconcerned with both bij and dij .\nIn the homogeneous RT DNS of Livescu &\nRistorcelli,9,10 Pij = 0 thus Mij is the sole source of\nbij which quickly vanishes in the initial stages of the flow\nevolution. On the other hand, bij indicates anisotropy for\nthe full extent of the simulations. This is most likely due\nto the suddenly decreasing turbulent Reynolds number\nclosely following the behavior of Mij . As the significance of the non-linear term in the Navier-Stokes equation (compared to viscous dissipation) decreases, the efficiency of the non-linear cascade, that would transfer\nenergy from the large to the small scales, weakens. This\neffectively locks in the anisotropy structure of bij which\nthus dissipates very slowly.\nThe VD PDF model is designed to account for a source\nof anisotropy that is independent of Mij and a (possibly)\ninitially nonzero bij . That is, in principle, the model is\ncapable of capturing the large and small scale anisotropy\nof variable-density, strained or low-Re flows through the\ncombined effects of Gij and Hij . For generality, the following discussion supposes an initially zero bij .\nThe special cases of Eq.

In this case bij is\ngoverned by Eq. (53). The choice of an anisotropic\nGij combined with a nonzero Hij opens up all the\npossibilities of the SDE (13) to correctly capture bij\nin VD flows. This most general formulation seems\nto be capable of representing nonzero bij patterns\nthat are more complex than that of a homogeneous\nRT flow.\nIn summary, we showed that the VD SDE (13) allows\nfor two independent sources of anisotropy, proportional\nto Gij and Hij , respectively. The question of whether\nGij , which is capable of sustaining anisotropy in the absence of shear production, should be assumed isotropic\nor anisotropic in general VD flows remains an open question. Functional forms of Gij and Hij are the subject of\nthe next paper, Ref. 21. Their combined effect should\n1.

Gij and Hij should provide the correct representation of the variable-density effects on the turbulent\nkinetic energy as given by Eq. (49).\n\nof Eq.

A mix metric ensures\nvanishing small scale anisotropy of different-density\nspecies in the fully mixed state.\n\n(70)\n\nThese equations show that only the normalized deviatoric part of Hij affects the second moments and only\ntheir anisotropic part, i.e. bij . As mixing progresses g(\u03b8)\ntakes on values from 0 to 1 and diminishes the small scale\nanisotropy, independent of Hij .\nThe developed constraints on the diffusion coefficients\n\u03c6I and \u03c6D , Eqs.

Enforcing mathematical consistency on the constraints, a function of a\nmix metric, g(\u03b8), naturally appears which ensures that\nthe small scale anisotropy is diminished in the fully mixed\nstate.

This must be taken into account by the specification of Gij as indicated by\nEq. (27).\n\u2022 In contrast to moment closures, the important\nsource of turbulence in VD flows, Mij defined by\nEq. (30), appears closed in the PDF formulation\nand thus requires no explicit modeling. The relation (41) guides the modeling of the physical processes of redistribution, transport, dissipation and\nthe triple correlations.\n\u2022 We derived a model constraint in inhomogeneous\nvariable-density flows with small scale anisotropy,\nEq. (49), for transport and scalar effects of variable\ndensity.\n\u2022 The VD SDE (13) allows for two independent\nsources of anisotropy, proportional to Gij and Hij ,\nrespectively. Gij is responsible for anisotropy at\nthe large scales, while Hij at the small scales.\n\n\u2022 The final form of the VD SDE (68) (incorporating\nthe constraints on the diffusion terms) reduces to\nthe GLM for constant-density flows as \u033a\u2032 \u2192 0.\nV.\n\nFAVRE MOMENT EQUATIONS\n\nVariable-density flows are traditionally investigated\n(and modeled) using Favre-averaged variables.

A forthcoming article21 will\ncombine these ideas with the ones on active scalar\nmixing2 to specify a joint probability density function\n(PDF) model for mixing-driven variable-density (VD)\nhydrodynamics and will present validation for RayleighTaylor flows.\nIn this paper we proposed a stochastic differential\nequation (SDE) for modeling the instantaneous velocity increments of Lagrangian particles in VD turbulence.\nThe functional form of the equation and its consequences\nhave been discussed in detail. Several consistency conditions and constraints, based on mathematical and physical considerations, have been developed. These results,\nsummarized in Table I, are all rigorous mathematical\nconsequences of the particular functional form of the proposed model equation and some basic physical considerations in VD flows.\nIn particular, we showed that the widely used generalized Langevin model1 for the velocity PDF in constantdensity flows can be extended to VD flows to include the\nfollowing features:\n1. Representing variable-density effects.\nThe extended model incorporates the effects of large density fluctuations due to non-uniform species concentrations on the fluid particle momentum in\nvariable-density turbulence. This includes:\n(a) VD effects on the inertia and mean forces\nterms in closed form. These are cubic (as well\nas quadratic) non-linearities in the NavierStokes equation and the mixing arising from\nthe strong coupling between the density and\nvelocity fields.\n(b) VD effects on the fluctuating pressure gradient\nand viscous forces in modeled form.\n2.

Consequently,\nto represent these processes no explicit modeling\nis necessary, no additional equations need to be\nsolved and the representation of these processes is\nmathematically and physically consistent. In VD\nmoment closures these quantities require separate\nequations to be solved and their unclosed terms approximated.\n3. Independence from the density model. The formulation for the momentum equation is independent of\nthe particular functional form of the density PDF\nmodel, but requires the knowledge of the instantaneous density, e.g. in the form of a SDE, such\nas discussed in Ref. 2. This allows the momentum\nequation to be coupled to any mixing model, representing the fluid density.\n4. Consistent representation of the small scale anisotropy. Turbulence anisotropy is important in\npredicting the correct mixing state, mixing efficiency and the production of turbulent kinetic energy. Compared to most second order moment closures that model the large scale anisotropy and assume isotropic small scales, the developed stochastic equation represents anisotropy at both the large\nand the small scales. This is important in nonequilibrium, highly distorted, low- or moderateReynolds-number or variable-density flows.\n5. Reduces to the original model for constant-density\n\n1\n\nD. C. Haworth and S.

We showed that the model coefficients\ncan be designed so that the stochastic VD model\nreduces to the constant-density case in the limit of\nvanishing density fluctuations.\nConstruction of a PDF model. A joint PDF model\ncan now be constructed for variable-density turbulence\nwhere the stochastic density and velocity fields are coupled at the instantaneous level. The main ingredients\nfor the hydrodynamics are collected in Table I, which is\nthe essence of the paper. The VD momentum equation\n(first line) must be coupled to a fluid mass density PDF\nmodel, such as discussed in Ref. 2, that represents conservation of mass and the mixing. Then, in the velocity\nmodel, the tensors Gij and Hij , the mix metric function,\ng(\u03b8), and the kinetic energy dissipation rate, \u03b5, must be\nspecified. Finally, the system must be augmented by an\nequation of state. The SDEs are discretized and numerically integrated in time for a large number of Lagrangian\nparticles (representing the flow itself) in a Monte-Carlo\nfashion. Such a joint PDF model and its predictions for\nRayleigh-Taylor flows are discussed in Ref. 21.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nJ. Waltz and J. D.
