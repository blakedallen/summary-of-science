This result suggests the existence of fluctuations,\neither static or dynamic, near the phase boundary separating the quantized Hall state at small\nlayer separations from the compressible state at larger separations. Interestingly, the anomalies in\ndrag seem to persist to larger layer separations than does interlayer phase coherence as detected in\ntunneling.\n\nAt high magnetic fields two-dimensional electron systems (2DES) exhibit a variety of collective states. For\nexample, if the perpendicular magnetic field is adjusted\nso that the density of electrons Ns equals one-half the degeneracy eB/h of the lowest spin resolved Landau level\n(i.e. at filling factor \u03bd = Ns h/eB = 1/2), the resulting\nstrongly correlated electron system can be successfully\nmodeled as a metallic liquid of composite fermions[1].\nThe system crudely resembles a conventional 2DES in\nzero magnetic field. No quantized Hall effect is seen.\nRemarkably, the system possesses a well-defined Fermi\nsurface and quasiparticles which move in semiclassical\ncyclotron orbits whose diameters diverge as \u03bd \u2192 1/2.\nNow consider a system consisting of two parallel\n2DESs, each at \u03bd = 1/2, separated by a barrier layer.\nObviously, if the separation d between the two 2DESs\nis large, they are uncoupled and the net system behaves\nmuch the same as a single layer. In contrast, if d is very\nsmall (less than the average separation between electrons\nin each layer) the ground state of the bilayer system is\nqualitatively different. In this strongly-coupled limit interlayer Coulomb interactions engender a novel broken\nsymmetry, spontaneous interlayer phase coherence, in\nwhich all electrons are coherently spread between both\nlayers, even in the hypothetical limit of zero interlayer\ntunneling[2]. This bizarre state, which is best characterized by the total filling factor \u03bdT = 1, may be viewed\nin a number of equivalent ways, including as an itinerant pseudospin ferromagnet or a Bose condensate of interlayer excitons. Experimentally, the system has been\nfound to display numerous striking properties, including\nthe quantized Hall effect (at Rxy = h/e2 )[3], a pseudospin textural phase transition[4, 5], Josephson-like interlayer tunneling[6], and, most relevant here, quantized\nHall drag[7]. Additional properties, including counterflow superfluidity, are anticipated[8].\nThe nature of the transition between the stronglycoupled ferromagnetic or excitonic phase at small d and\nthe weakly-coupled composite fermion liquids at large\nd is very poorly understood. As d increases from zero\n\n(at zero temperature) the ferromagnetic phase suffers increasingly severe quantum fluctuations which eventually\ndestroy the (algebraic) pseudomagnetic order at a critical layer separation. Although there exists numerical\nevidence suggesting that this quantum phase transition\nmay be weakly first order[9], current experiments suggest\na continuous transition.\nBeyond the nature of the demise of the ferromagnetic\nphase as d increases, remains the question of the ground\nstate of the system above the critical separation. Before reverting to independent composite fermion liquids\nat very large d, there is the possibility of additional interlayer correlated phases at intermediate separations. Candidate states include bilayer Wigner crystals[10], paired\ncomposite fermion liquids[11], and various other exotic\nphases which may share some but not all of the properties of the ferromagnetic phase (e.g. interlayer phase\ncoherence but no quantized Hall effect, etc.)[12, 13]. In\nthis paper we report interlayer friction measurements\n(\"Coulomb drag\") which shed light on the transition\nbetween the strongly- and weakly-coupled regimes at\n\u03bdT = 1. In particular, we observe a large enhancement\nof the longitudinal component of the drag near the transition. Although rapidly attenuated, this enhancement\npersists to surprisingly large layer separations.\nDrag measurements are performed by driving a current\nI, typically 1nA at 5Hz, through one of the two layers\nof a double layer 2DES while monitoring the voltage VD\nwhich appears in the other, electrically isolated, layer.\nAt zero magnetic field the drag resistance RD = VD /I\nprovides a unique measure of the interlayer momentum\nrelaxation rate. For closely-spaced layers and low temperatures this rate is dominated by simple Coulomb scattering and hence the moniker Coulomb drag.\nThe samples used in the present experiments consist of\ntwo 18nm GaAs quantum wells separated by a 10nm barrier layer of Al0.9 Ga0.1 As. Each quantum well contains a\n2DES which, in the sample's as-grown state, has a density of about Ns \u2248 5.3\u00d71010 cm\u22122 and a low-temperature\nmobility of \u03bc \u2248 106 cm2 /Vs. Data from three samples, A,\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: Coulomb drag resistances in sample A at T = 30mK,\nin the vicinity of \u03bdT = 1. Left column: Hall drag Rxy,D ; right\ncolumn: longitudinal drag Rxx,D . Each row corresponds to a\ndifferent 2D density in the bilayer sample, and thus a different\neffective layer separation d/l at \u03bdT = 1.\n\nB, and C, are reported here. Samples A and B consist\nof square mesas, 250\u03bcm on a side, with four arms extending outward to remote ohmic contacts. Sample C is\nbar-shaped, 40 \u00d7 400\u03bcm, and has five arms and ohmic\ncontacts. These contacts are connected to one or the\nother 2DES using a selective depletion scheme[14]. The\ndensities of the individual 2DESs in the central mesa region are controlled with electrostatic gates deposited on\nthe top and backside of the samples. A detailed study\nof the Coulomb drag in these samples at zero magnetic\nfield has been reported elsewhere[15].\nFigure 1 shows representative Coulomb drag data from\nsample A in the vicinity of \u03bdT = 1 at T = 30mK. Each\nrow corresponds to a different effective layer separation\nd/l, with d = 28nm the center-to-center quantum well\nseparation and l = (h\u0304/eB)1/2 the magnetic length at\n\u03bdT = 1. This key ratio governs the relative importance\nof inter- and intra-layer Coulomb interactions in the bilayer system, and can be varied in situ by symmetrically\nchanging the electron densities in the individual quantum wells. The data in Fig. 1 is therefore plotted versus\nthe inverse total filling factor \u03bdT \u22121 , instead of magnetic\nfield, to aid in comparing the different densities. The\nright-hand panels display the longitudinal drag resistance\nRxx,D (i.e. drag voltage parallel to the current flow in\n\nthe drive layer) while the left-hand panels present the\ntransverse, or Hall, drag resistance Rxy,D .\nThe top two panels (a and e) of Fig. 1 show Hall and\nlongitudinal drag data at d/l = 1.60. At this effective\nlayer separation the system is well within the stronglycoupled bilayer quantum Hall effect phase and, as reported previously[7], at \u03bdT = 1 the Hall drag exhibits a\nplateau accurately quantized at Rxy,D = h/e2 while the\nlongitudinal drag Rxx,D is essentially zero. While it is\nnot surprising that Rxx,D is zero in the quantized Hall\nstate (the gap to charged excitations suppressing dissipation at low temperatures), the quantization of Hall drag\nis a dramatic consequence of the physics of the strong\ncoupling regime and supports, albeit indirectly, the existence of counterflow superfluidity[8].\nOn moving away from \u03bdT = 1, the Hall drag rapidly diminishes while the longitudinal drag displays two strong\nmaxima. The sign of the Hall drag voltage is the same\nas that of the conventional Hall voltage in the currentcarrying layer. In contrast, the sign of the longitudinal\ndrag voltage is the opposite of the conventional longitudinal voltage drop in the current-carrying layer. Indeed, for\nall the data reported here the sign of Rxx,D is the same\nas that encountered at zero magnetic field where the drag\nvoltage reflects the electric field needed to counteract the\nfrictional force due to the current flow in the drive layer.\nThe remaining panels of Fig. 1 show how Coulomb\ndrag changes as d/l increases and the strongly-coupled\nbilayer quantized Hall phase collapses. Panels b, c, and d\nshow that the Hall drag plateau becomes a rapidly subsiding local maximum as the d/l increases. More interestingly, panels f , g, and h reveal that the longitudinal\ndrag first evolves from a broad zero into a local minimum between tall peaks. By d/l = 1.76 these peaks\nhave merged to form a single peak. Further increases of\nd/l steadily reduce the magnitude of this peak in Rxx,D .\nFigure 2 displays both drag resistances precisely at\n\u03bdT = 1 as functions of d/l. These data were obtained\nfrom sample B at T = 50mK. As the figure indicates, the\nHall drag resistance Rxy,D undergoes a rapid yet smooth\ntransition from very small values above d/l \u2248 1.8 to the\nvery large value of h/e2 = 25.8k\u03a9 for d/l below about\n1.65. At the same time, the longitudinal drag Rxx,D\nexhibits a strong and rather symmetric peak in the transition region. At T = 50mK this peak is centered at\nd/l \u2248 1.73 and has a half-width of about \u2206(d/l) = 0.035.\nThe height of the peak, about 1.8k\u03a9, represents an impressively large drag resistance. This value is in fact\nroughly comparable to the conventional longitudinal resistance Rxx of the bilayer system under the same conditions (the deep minimum in Rxx characteristic of the\n\u03bdT = 1 QHE developing only at lower values of d/l).\nBoth the d/l location and the height of this peak in\nRxx,D vary slightly from one sample to the next, but\nits existence and qualitative behavior is quite robust.\nThe width and location of the peak in Rxx,D at \u03bdT = 1\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 3: Temperature dependence of longitudinal drag resistance at \u03bdT = 1 in sample B at three different d/l values.\n\nFIG. 2: a) Hall (open dots) and longitudinal (closed dots)\ndrag at \u03bdT = 1 and T = 50mK vs. d/l in sample B. b) and c)\nTemperature dependence of location and half-width of peak\nin Rxx,D at \u03bdT = 1. Lines are guides to the eye.\n\ndepend upon temperature. Figure 2b reveals that the\npeak moves to lower d/l as T increases. This dependence,\nwhich is roughly linear in T , extrapolates to about d/l =\n1.76 as T \u2192 0. At the same time, Fig. 2c shows that the\npeak half-width, \u2206(d/l), increases substantially as the\ntemperature is increased to 300mK. Interestingly, over\nthe range 25mK < T < 300mK the height of the peak in\nRxx,D at \u03bdT = 1 varies by only about 15%.\nFigure 3 displays the temperature dependence of Rxx,D\nat \u03bdT = 1 at three different values of d/l. For d/l = 1.58,\nwhich is well within the bilayer QHE, Rxx,D rises as the\ntemperature is reduced from T = 0.5K to about 0.2K but\nthen drops precipitously as T is further reduced. In this\nlow temperature regime Rxx,D is thermally activated[7],\ni.e. Rxx,D \u223c e\u2212EA /T , with EA \u2248 0.4K. This dependence is expected within the gapped QHE phase and,\nindeed, the conventional resistivity Rxx shows the same\nactivation energy[7]. At d/l = 1.93, which is in the nonQHE compressible phase, Rxx,D is much smaller in magnitude and falls monotonically as T is reduced. This\ntemperature dependence is reminiscent of that seen at\nB = 0 in the present samples[15] and at \u03bdT = 1 in much\nmore widely-spaced (d/l \u2248 3.9) double layer 2D electron\nsystems[16]. Roughly speaking, this behavior reflects the\ncharacteristic reduction of the phase space for inelastic\nCoulomb scattering events as the temperature falls. A\nquantitative model for Coulomb drag at \u03bdT = 1 and large\nd/l has been developed by Ussishkin and Stern[17].\nAt d/l = 1.74, i.e. in the middle of the transition\nregion, the temperature dependence of Rxx,D at \u03bdT =\n1 is markedly different than at both larger and smaller\n\nd/l. After remaining roughly constant on cooling from\nT = 0.5K to about 0.2K, the drag rises rapidly as the\ntemperature falls further. Below about T = 50mK Rxx,D\napparently saturates.\nThe data described above show that Coulomb drag is\na sensitive indicator of the transition between the weakly\nand strongly-coupled regimes of a bilayer 2DES at \u03bdT =\n1. This is especially clear from the behavior of the Hall\ndrag resistance Rxy,D shown in Fig. 2. Although nonzero Hall drag can in principle result from density (or\nenergy) dependent scattering rates in a 2D system[18,\n19], the development of a large, and ultimately quantized,\nRxy,D is generally believed to require non-perturbative\ninterlayer correlations. Indeed, the qualitative behavior\nof Rxy,D shown in Fig. 2 was anticipated[20, 21, 22, 23,\n24].\nIn contrast, the strong peak in the \u03bdT = 1 longitudinal drag resistance Rxx,D which develops in the middle\nof the Hall drag transition comes as a surprise. It seems\nreasonable to interpret the d/l value at the center of this\npeak as the critical one separating the strongly-coupled\n\u03bdT = 1 QHE phase from the weakly-coupled non-QHE\nphase. Within the ferromagnetism picture of the QHE\nphase, at zero temperature this critical point marks the\ndestruction of the ordered state by quantum fluctuations\nof the pseudospin moment. The shifting of the peak to\nlower d/l as the temperature rises (cf. Fig. 2b) is consistent with thermal fluctuations further destablizing the\nordered state. The non-zero width of the peak in Rxx,D\nvs. d/l suggests an inhomogeneous situation in which the\n2D electron system fluctuates between the QHE and nonQHE phases. Stern and Halperin (SH)[25] have suggested\nthat these fluctuations are static and result from mesoscopic spatial inhomogeneities of the 2D electron density.\nOn the other hand, dynamic critical fluctuations in an\notherwise homogeneous system could also be involved.\nIn the SH picture, as d/l is reduced toward the critical value puddles of the strongly-coupled QHE phase\nappear within a background of weakly-coupled non-QHE\n\n\f4\nmay be local regions in our samples in which d/l has\nbeen reduced by atomic steps in the various heterointerfaces. However, the needed reduction is \u223c 30%, or about\n8nm, and this seems implausibly large[27]. We emphasize\nthat no analogous anomaly is seen in the zero bias interlayer tunneling conductance. The enhanced tunneling,\nwhich heralds the onset of interlayer phase coherence[6],\nis either absent or unobservably small for d/l \u2265 1.85.\nThis discrepancy raises the possibility that the enhanced\n\u03bdT = 1 drag at larger d/l may not require interlayer\nphase coherence.\nFIG. 4: Longitudinal drag in sample C at T = 300mK. Expanded view in the inset reveals a small enhancement near\n\u03bdT = 1 where d/l = 2.6.\n\nfluid. As d/l is reduced further, these puddles eventually\npercolate. Via an analysis which assumes the puddles\nare (as expected) counterflow superfluids while the background fluid is a conventional double layer 2D conductor\nwith a large Hall resistance but little Coulomb drag, SH\nconclude that the macroscopically averaged longitudinal\ndrag resistivity \u03c1xx,D of the composite system can become very large just before the puddles percolate. In\nthis situation, SH predict that \u03c1xx,D grows as the temperature falls, eventually saturating near h/2e2 \u2248 13k\u03a9.\nFigure 3 demonstrates that such a qualitative temperature dependence is observed. Although Rxx,D near the\nmidpoint of the transition region reaches only \u2248 1.9k\u03a9 as\nT \u2192 0, classical geometric effects[26] associated with our\nsquare sample geometry suggest that the experimental\nlongitudinal drag resistivity may be as much as a factor of \u03c0/ln2 larger than Rxx,D , or about 8.6k\u03a9. Further\nexperiments may reveal whether, as SH suggest, the remaining discrepancy is due to the finite conventional (i.e.\nparallel transport) resistivity of the sample at \u03bdT = 1.\nWe turn finally to the behavior of Coulomb drag at\nlarger layer separations. Prior experiments[16], at d/l \u2248\n3.9, showed no evidence of any anomaly in Rxx,D at total Landau level filling \u03bdT = 1. As Fig. 2 shows, the\nenhancement of Rxx,D at \u03bdT = 1 in the present samples\nsubsides rapidly as d/l increases. Surprisingly, however,\nit remains observable out to d/l \u2248 2.6. At these large\nd/l the enhancement appears as a small bump on top of\na background arising from drag scattering processes between weakly-coupled 2D layers - see Fig. 4. The bump\nat \u03bdT = 1 is a genuine bilayer effect: It remains present\neven when small antisymmetric density imbalances are\nimposed on the double layer system. By contrast, the\nother features (e.g. the minima at \u03bdT = 2/3 + 2/3 and\n2/5+2/5) seen in Fig. 4 split in two, thus proving that\nthey are fundamentally single layer effects.\nThe existence of enhanced longitudinal drag at \u03bdT = 1\nat such large d/l is not understood. In principle, there\n\nWe thank Ady Stern, Bertrand Halperin and Steven\nGirvin for enlightening discussions and Ian Spielman for\nhelp with sample fabrication.
