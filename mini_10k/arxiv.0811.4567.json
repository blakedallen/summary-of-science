Their\nsuccesful creation relies on the peculiar nature of the microcavity polariton quasiparticle, that combine a very\nlight effective mass (high quantum degeneracy temperature) with interparticle interactions that provide efficient\nrelaxation. The formation of spontaneous coherence in\nthese systems is now routinely achieved in several laboratories [2, 3, 4, 5].\nOne crucial difference between polariton condensates\nand other realizations of the two dimensional Bose gas\nsuch as liquid 4 He films [6] and tightly confined ultracold atomic gases [7] comes from the finite life time of\nthe microcavity polaritons of the order of a few ps. In\norder to compensate for the polariton losses, new particles can be continuously injected into the microcavity.\nThe resulting steady state is not a thermal equilibrium\none, still it shows features expected for an equilibrium\nBEC. For example, the tail of the momentum distribution\ncan in many cases be fitted by an exponential MaxwellBoltzmann decay. The lack of full thermalization is already clear from the fact that the extracted temperature\nis in general not equal to the temperature of the reservoir\nconstituted by the semiconductor lattice [2, 3, 4].\nEffects that have no counterpart at equilibrium have\nbeen observed in polariton condensates. For example, the\ncondensate state can depend dramatically on the size of\nthe excitation spot [8, 9]: in the case of a large pump\nspot the usual condensation around zero momentum is\nobserved, instead for a small excitation spot the condensation occurs on a ring in momentum space. This difference has been explained within a mean field theory based\non the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, including driving and\ndissipation [10]. More recently, another remarkable phenomenon related to the flow in a continuously pumped\npolariton condensate was observed experimentally [11]:\nvortices are spontaneously created in polariton condensates without setting the system into rotation. A theoretical interpretation of this effect was given in the framework of the generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation. In a\nsignificant fraction of random landscape realizations the\npolariton condensate contains a vortex. A related prediction was made by Keeling and Berloff: they found that\na rotating vortex lattice can be spontaneously generated\nin a large regular trap [12].\n\nThe above mentioned phenomena can be understood\nwithin a mean field theory, i.e. a theory where the quantum polariton field is replaced by a classical field. In\nthis approximation, all information on the fluctuations is\nhowever lost. Since we deal with a two-dimensional system, the physics of fluctuations in polariton condensates\nis in analogy with equilibrium systems expected to be\nvery rich [7, 13, 14] and the question arises for example\nto what extent the physics related to the BerezinskiiKosterlitz-Thouless survives the driving and dissipation\nof polariton condensates.\n20\n15\n10\nExciton Reservoir\n\n5\n\nx\n\nI.\n\n\u03b5\u2212\u03b5 (meV)\n\narXiv:0811.4567v1 [cond-mat.other] 27 Nov 2008\n\nWe use the truncated Wigner approximation to derive stochastic classical field equations for\nthe description of polariton condensates. Our equations are shown to reduce to the Boltzmann\nequation in the limit of low polariton density. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to analyze\nthe momentum distribution and the first and second order coherence when the particle density is\nvaried across the condensation threshold.\n\n0\n\u22125\nLower polariton\n\u221210\n\u2212200\n\n\u2212100\n\n0\n\u22121\nk (\u03bcm )\n\n100\n\n200\n\nFIG. 1: Sketch of the separation of phase space in two regions:\nthe lower polariton and the exciton reservoir. Scattering from\nthe exciton reservoir into the lower polariton region replenishes the lower polaritons.\n\nExperimentally, the fluctuations of the polariton condensates have been investigated under the form of the\nfirst and second order coherence functions. In the first\norder equal time spatial correlation function, long range\ncorrelations were observed above the stimulation threshold for condensation [3, 15]. Other correlation functions\ninclude the temporal first [5] and second order coherence\n[5, 16, 17].\nThe semiclassical Boltzmann equation [18, 19, 20] provides a theoretical description of the first order spatial\ncoherence, which is the Fourier transform of the momentum distribution. Including the details of the relaxation\nmechanisms, this formalism is expeced to give a reliable\n\n\f2\nestimate for the required polariton density to achieve condensation. Above the condensation threshold, the random phase approximation contained in the Boltzmann\nequation breaks down and more sophisticated techniques\nshould be used. Schemes that have been implemented\nin the literature involve the separation of the condensate\nmode from the excited states [21] and a generalization\nof the Boltzmann equation that includes the coherences\nwithin a Bogoliubov approximation [22].\nOne of the remarkable consequences of the nonequilibrium nature of the polariton condensates is that the\ncollective excitation spectrum is changed at low wave vectors: a diffusive instead of soundlike character is found\nfor the low energy phase modes. This dispersion of elementary excitations was found in a theoretical description based on a Keldysh Green function technique worked\nout by the Littlewood group [23]. The same spectrum is\nstraightforwardly recovered by linearizing the generalized\nGross-Pitaevskii equation around a steady state [24], a\ncalculation that is easily extended to spatially nonuniform situations.\nIt is well known from quantum optics and the theory of\nweakly interacting Bose gases that fluctuations can be included by introducing a stochastic element in the GrossPitaevskii equation [25, 26, 27, 28]. For polariton systems\nin the parametric oscillation regime, such a method was\nused in Ref. [29]. One of the great advantages of these so\ncalled classical field methods is that the nonuniformity of\na system does not introduce any appreciable extra cost\nin their numerical implementation. A second advantage\nis that practical numerical calculations do not require a\nperturbative expansion around a condensed state and can\neven be applied to study physics related to the condensation phase transition [30, 31]. Finally, these methods\ncan describe the evolution of the system in real time so\nthat information on both the steady state and transients\ncan be obtained. The latter can be of particular use to\nmodel experiments that are performed under pulsed excitation [2].\nDue to the approximations involved in the classical\nfield methods, they cannot describe the particles up to\narbitrary large momenta, where quantum effects (most\nnotably spontaneous scattering) are dominant [25]. In\nthis respect, polariton condensates are very well suited\nfor a classical field description, because, as illustrated in\nFig. 1, the phase space can be naturally divided into two\nparts: i) a low energy polaritonic region with a small\neffective mass that shows quantum coherence above a\ncertain threshold density and ii) a high energy excitonic\n'reservoir' region with a high effective mass that under\ntypical experimental densities behaves as an incoherent\nclassical gas. The role of the two subsystems is very different: the polaritonic field is the quantity of experimental interest because it is easily accessible in photoluminescence experiments and can be driven into the quantum degenerate regime. The role of the reservoir is to\nreplenish the polariton region through relaxation.\nWe will present in this paper a set of classical field\n\nequations for the (Wigner distribution function of the)\npolariton dynamics coupled to the exciton reservoir and\napply them to calculate the equal time first and second\norder coherence functions across the condensation threshold. For simplicity, we have not included the polarization degree of freedom. A Boltzmann description of polariton condensates including polarization can be found\nin Ref. [32]. At thermal equilibrium, the magnitude of\nfluctuations can be parametrized by a single quantity,\nthe temperature. For a weakly interacting system, this\ntemperature can be extracted by fitting the tail of the\nmomentum distribution with a Maxwellian curve. Experiments have shown that the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is also recovered for the tail of the out of equilibrium polariton distribution [2, 3, 4] and has even been\nexperimentally observed in the case of weak coupling lasing [33]. We will show that out of equilibrium, the universal characterization of fluctuations by a temperature\nparameter breaks down. We will point out several crucial aspects of the condensate-reservoir interactions that\naffect the correlation functions without changing the tail\nof the momentum distribution.\nWe start by presenting the model Hamiltonian for the\nnonresonantly excited polariton system in Sec. II. It is\nshown in Sec. III how a master equation for the lower polariton field can be derived and how to solve it within the\ntruncated Wigner approximation in Sec. IV. The reservoir dynamics is discussed in Sec. V. In Sec. VI, we discuss the relation between our model and the Boltzmann\nequation. Numerical Monte Carlo results are presented\nin Sec. VII. Conclusions are drawn in Sec. VIII.\nII.\n\nHAMILTONIAN\n\nIn order to treat these two regions of polaritonic phase\nspace with a very different character, we replace the original Hamiltonian by a Hamiltonian for polaritons and\nexcitons, that are anihilated by the operators \u03c8(x) and\n\u03c6(x) respectively. In terms of these annihilation operators, our model Hamiltonian reads\nZ\nH = dx [HLP (x) + HR (x) + HR,LP (x)] .\n(1)\nThe lower polariton Hamiltonian density is the usual\n\u2212\u22072\ng\n\u03c8(x) + \u03c8 \u2020 (x)\u03c8 \u2020 (x)\u03c8(x)\u03c8(x),\n2mLP\n2\n(2)\nwhere mLP is the lower polariton effective mass and g\nquantifies the strength of the polariton-polariton interactions, that is well approximated by a zero-range potential.

The second term on the RHS vanishes when\nthe trace over the reservoir is taken, so we only have to\nanalyze the third one. It consists of terms like\ngain/loss\n\nTrR {HR,LP\n\ngain/loss\n\nHR,LP\n\n\u03c1},\n\n(10)\n\nwhere\ngain\ngain\nloss\nloss\nTrR {HR,LP\nHR,LP\n\u03c1LP } = TrR {HR,LP\nHR,LP\n\u03c1LP } = 0.\n(11)\n\n(19)\nwhere the interaction shift in the frequency of \u03c8Q was neglected. The exponential eiQx can be combined with the\nexponential in Eq. (16). Because the typical reservoir\nmomentum is much larger than the typical lower polariton momentum (see Fig. 1), this factor is negligible. For\nthe same reason, also the x in the second field operator\nin Eq. (16) can be neglected. If we then also assume that\nthe density matrix is slowly varying on the microscopic\ntime scale t, the integral over the relative time imposes\nenergy conservation for the scattering process. We can\nthen finally rewrite Eq.

(20)\n\n\f4\nThe main simplifying assumption of the model consists\nnow of assuming that the expression (20) is a function of\nthe total reservoir density nR and the energy \u01ebq only.\nThis comes down to the assumption of a steady state\ndistribution of the reservoir excitons among the different\nk states.\nWorking out the trace over the reservoir in Eq.

Collecting\nall these terms, we obtain\nd\n\u03c1(t) = \u2212i[HLP , \u03c1] + Kin (\u03c1) + Kout (\u03c1),\ndt\n\n(21)\n\nwhere the density matrix evolves under the in-scattering\nas\nZ\n\u0002\n1X\nKin (\u03c1) =\ndxRin (nR , \u01ebq ) eiqx \u03c8 \u2020 (x)\u03c1\u03c8(q)\n2 q\n\u0003\n\u2212eiqx \u03c8(q)\u03c8 \u2020 (x)\u03c1 + h.c. , (22)\n\nand under out-scattering as\n1X\nKout (\u03c1) =\n2 q\n\nZ\n\n\u0002\ndxRout (nR , \u01ebq ) eiqx \u03c8(q)\u03c1\u03c8 \u2020 (x)\n\u0003\n\u2212eiqx \u03c8 \u2020 (x)\u03c8(q)\u03c1 + h.c. , (23)\n\nThe rates Rin/out are given by the usual semiclassical\nBoltzmann rates.

[35],\npps. 115,124). This method has been applied to study\nBEC aspects of parametrically generated signal polariton\nin microcavities in Ref. [29].\nThe Wigner distribution function is a quasi probability\ndistribution defined on the space spanned by the complex\nvalued functions \u03c8(x). In order to avoid ambiguity, we\nwill use below an explicit 'hat' notation for the quantum\nfield operator \u03c8\u0302(x).\nIn terms of the density matrix, the Wigner distribution\nfunction is defined as\nZ\n1\nPW [\u03c8(x)] = 2\nd2 \u03bb(x) exp[\u03c8(x)\u03bb(x)\u2217 \u2212 \u03c8(x)\u2217 \u03bb(x)]\n\u03c0\nZ\n1\nd2 \u03b1(x)h\u03b1(x)|\u03c1 exp[\u03bb(x)\u03c8\u0302 \u2020 (x)\u2212\u03bb\u2217 (x)\u03c8\u0302(x)|\u03b1(x)i],\n\u00d7\n\u03c0\n(26)\nwhere |\u03b1(x)i is a coherent state of polaritons at position x with complex amplitude \u03b1(x). Expectation values\ncalculated with the Wigner distribution function correspond to expectation values of symmetrized operator expressions. For example for the one-bbody density matrix,\nwe have:\nZ\n\nd2\u03c8(x) PW [\u03c8(x)] \u03c8 \u2217 (x)\u03c8(x\u2032 )\n=\n\n1\nTr{\u03c1[\u03c8\u0302 \u2020 (x)\u03c8\u0302(x\u2032 ) + \u03c8\u0302(x\u2032 )\u03c8\u0302 \u2020 (x)}.\n2\n\nUsing the operator correspondences [35], the equation\nof motion for the Wigner quasi-probability distribution\nPW is computed:\n\n\u2202\n\u22022\n\u2202\n\u2217\nFdet \u2212\nF\n+\n[\u03b3 + Rin + Rout ]\n\u2202\u03c8(x)\n\u2202\u03c8 \u2217 (x) det \u2202\u03c8(x)\u03c8 \u2217 (x)\n\u0014\n\u0015\u001b\ng\n\u22022\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2217\n+i\n\u03c8\n(x)\n\u2212\n\u03c8(x)\nPW [\u03c8(x), \u03c8 \u2217 (x)].\n2\u2206V \u2202\u03c8(x)\u03c8 \u2217 (x) \u2202\u03c8 \u2217 (x)\n\u2202\u03c8(x)\n\nFdet is the deterministic mean field force acting on the\n\n(27)\n\n(28)\n\npolaritons\nFdet = \u2212i\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\ni(Rin \u2212 Rout \u2212 \u03b3)\ng\n\u2212~2 \u22072\n+\n+\n|\u03c8(x)|2 \u03c8(x).\n2m\n2\n\u2206V\n(29)\n\n\f5\nIn Eq.

If this term is neglected (the so-called\ntruncated Wigner approximation), the quasi-probability\ndistribution PW obeys a standard Fokker-Plank equation, that correponds to the Langevin equation\nd\u03c8(x) = Fdet [\u03c8(x), \u03c8 \u2217 (x)] + dW (x),\n\n(32)\n\nwhere dW is a complex Gaussian stochastic variable with\nthe correlation functions:\n\u2032\n\nThis approximation allowed to trace out the excitonic\ndegrees of freedom and to isolate the quantum dynamics\nof the polaritons from the classical exciton dynamics. In\nprinciple, the reservoir density appears as a deterministic\nclassical quantity in the resulting equations of motion\nfor the lower polariton dynamics. Physically, however,\nthis is not expected to be a very good approximation,\nbecause the condensate serves as a relaxation mechanism.\nStimulated scattering makes the rate of this relaxation to\ndepend on the reservoir population. Similar ideas have\nbeen implemented in Ref. [21], where the dynamics of\na single condensate mode was coupled to a Boltzmann\nequation for the excited states, and in Ref. [5], where the\nreservoir was modelled by a saturable gain medium, a\nmodel widely used in laser physics [41].\nWe propose to go beyond the approximation that the\nreservoir is unaltered by the system by coupling its dynamics to the equation of motion for the classical polariton field\ndnR\n= \u2212\u03b3R [nR \u2212 noR (Ip , \u03c8)],\ndt\n\n(35)\n\nhdW (x)dW (x )i = 0,\nwhere noR (Ip , \u03c8) is the average steady state value of the\n\u0001\ndt\n\u2217\n\u2032\nS\nS\n\u2032\nreservoir density in the presence of a pump with intensity\nhdW (x)dW (x )i =\nhx|Rin + Rout |x i + 2\u03b3\u03b4x,x\u2032 ,\n4\u2206V\nIp and a lower polariton field \u03c8.

The function P is peaked around the value of\nW\n\nthe field \u03c8(x) whose squared modulus equals |\u03c8(x)|2 =\nN (x) + 1/2. The variation of PW occurs on a scale of\nits argument of order one. Derivatives are therefore expected to be of the order of the function PW itself and\nthe prefactors determine the relative importance of the\nderivative terms in Eq.(4). This leads us to the conclusion that the third order derivative is negligible with\nrespect to the second order one if\ng\n\u03b3\u226b\n.\n\u2206V\n\n(34)\n\nThe dissipative character of the system thus increases the\nregion of validity of the truncated Wigner approximation.\nThe dissipation gives away information about the system\nand destroys nontrivial quantum states (e.g. number or\nSchr\u00f6dinger cat states). In terms of the Wigner function,\noscillations of PW accompanied by regions where it becomes negative (that cannot be represented by a regular\nprobability distribution) are washed out by the dissipation [36].\nV.\n\nTHE EXCITON RESERVOIR\n\nIn our description of the microcavity dynamics, the\nexciton-like particles are treated as a classical reservoir.\n\nnoR (P, \u03c8) = \u03b2(Ip \u2212\n\nd \u2020\nh\u03c8 \u03c8i|res ),\ndt\n\n(36)\n\nd\nh\u03c8 \u2020 \u03c8i|res = 2Re[\u03c8 \u2217 (Rin \u2212 Rout )\u03c8] is the net\nwhere dt\nscattering rate from the reservoir into the lower polariton\nbranch. It is instructive to substitute Eq. (36) into Eq.\n(35):\n\ndnR\nd\n= P \u2212 \u03b3R nR \u2212 \u03b2\u03b3R h\u03c8 \u2020 \u03c8i|res ,\ndt\ndt\n\n(37)\n\nwhere P = \u03b2Ip is the effective pump term for the active reservoir polaritons. The parameter \u03b2 quantifies the\nbackaction of the condensate on the reservoir. This backaction is needed to obtain a steady state for the dynamical equations above the threshold, where for nR = P/\u03b3R\nthe in-scattering rate exceeds the out-scattering rate. In\nmean field theory, the reservoir density nR is clamped to\nits threshold value nR,mf that satisfies for homogeneous\nsystems n2R,mf Rin (0) \u2212 nR,mf Rout (0) = \u03b3. If we rewrite\nthe motion equations for nR in terms of the renormalized\n\u00f1R = nR /nR,mf , we have\nd\nd\u00f1R\n= P\u0303 \u2212 \u03b3R \u00f1R \u2212 \u03b1 h\u03c8 \u2020 \u03c8i|res ,\ndt\ndt\n\n(38)\n\nwhere \u03b1 = \u03b2\u03b3R /nR,mf . Also in the presence of fluctuations, the dimensionless reservoir density \u00f1R is close to\n\n\f6\none above threshold, in order for the gain to compensate\nfor the losses. The factor \u03b1 plays an important physical role because the backaction of the condensate on the\nreservoir tends to damp the condensate fluctuations. If\nthe condensate density is at some time larger than average, the reservoir will be depleted, Rin \u2212 Rout decreases\nand the deterministic part in the equations of motion for\nthe condensate will decrease the amplitude of the fluctuation. In principle, the parameter \u03b1 could be calculated from the Boltzmann equation. We prefer however\nto study the physics in terms of this parameter, because\nit gives a good insight in the nonequilibrium aspects of\nthe coherence.\nIn the truncated Wigner approximation, the density\nof polaritons is related to \u03c8 as n = |\u03c8|2 \u2212 1/(2\u2206V ),\nor in words, the classical field \u03c8 contains half a particle\nper mode of zero point fluctuations. These fluctuations\nshould be taken into account when evaluating the last\nterm in Eq. (38). For the out-scattering, the zero-point\nfluctuations do not contribute and should be subtracted,\nwhereas for the in-scattering, the zero-point fluctuations\ngive rise to only half of the spontaneous in-scattering.\nThe remaining part should be added. The equation of\nmotion for the reduced reservoir density then finally reads\nd\u00f1R\nd\n= P\u0303 \u2212 \u03b3R \u00f1R \u2212 \u03b1 h\u03c8 \u2020 \u03c8i|res,W\ndt\ndt\n\u03b1 X\n\u2212\n[Rout (\u01ebk ) + Rout (\u01ebk )] . (39)\n2\u2206V\nk\n\nVI.\n\nRELATION WITH THE BOLTZMANN\nEQUATION\n\nIn the dissipative case, the derivation of the truncated\nWigner equation did not rely on the formation of a condensate. We can therefore describe within the same formalism the condensed and non-condensed polariton gas.\nIn the case that coherence is negligible, it is instructive\nto simplify the stochastic equations of motion (32). We\nwill find that in the incoherent regime, the polariton condensate can be described with a Boltzmann-like equation [37].\nFor simplicity, we consider the case of a uniform reservoir density. By writing the stochastic motion equations\nfor the field \u03c8(k) in momentum space, treating the interactions in the second Born approximation, and assuming\nthat there are no phase relations between the different\nmomentum components h\u03c8 \u2217 (k, t)\u03c8(k\u2032 , t)i = [N (k, t) +\n1/2]\u03b4k,k\u2032 , one obtains the following Boltzmann like equation for the time evolution of the densities in momentum\nspace\ndN (k, t)\n= Rin (\u01ebk )[N (k, t) + 1] \u2212 [Rout (\u01ebk ) + \u03b3]N (k, t)\ndt\n+ IB [N (k)] + IQ [N (k)]. (40)\nThe first two terms describe the evolution of the mode\noccupation due to the interaction with the reservoir and\n\nlosses through the cavity mirrors. Collisions are described by the last two terms. IB is the usual Boltzmann\ncollision integral:\nIB [N (k)] = \u22122\u03c0g 2\n\nX\n\n\u03b4\u03b3\u2212R (\u01eb1 + \u01eb2 \u2212 \u01eb3 \u2212 \u01eb4 )\n\nk1 ,k2\n\n\u00d7 [N1 N2 (1 + N3 )(1 + N4 ) \u2212 N3 N4 (1 + N1 )(1 + N2 )] ,\n(41)\nwhere N1 (t) = N (k, t), N2 (t) = N (k1 +k2 \u2212k, t), N3 (t) =\nN (k1 , t), N4 (t) = N (k2 , t) and analogous for the energies \u01ebi . The \u03b4-function for energy conservation is\nbroadened due to the finite lifetime of the polaritons:\n\u03b4\u03bd (\u03c9) = sin(\u03c9\u03bd)/(\u03c0\u03c9).\nThe extra collisional term is due to to the fact that\nour stochastic classical field model does not coincide with\nthe true quantum dynamics (the third order derivatives\nin Eq. (28) are neglected):\nIC [N (k)] = \u2212\n\n\u03c0g 2 X\n\u03b4\u03b3\u2212R (\u01eb1 + \u01eb2 \u2212 \u01eb3 \u2212 \u01eb4 )\n2\nk1 ,k2\n\n\u00d7 [N1 + N2 \u2212 N3 \u2212 N4 ].\n\n(42)\n\nThis term is spurious, because the Boltzmann equation\nshould be recovered in the incoherent limit. Our classical\nfield model can therefore only be a good approximation\nof the full quantum dynamics if the term IC is negligible\nwith respect to the other terms in Eq. (40). It scales\nas IC \u221d (g/\u2206V )(gn\u2206V ). If the occupation numbers per\ngrid cell n\u2206V are much larger than unity, the Boltzmann\ncollision term IB is obviously dominant with respect to\nIC . This is the typical condition for the use of the Wigner\ndistribution function in the description of a stable Bose\ngas [25]. For bosons with a finite life time, this condition\ncan be relaxed, because even when n\u2206V is not much\nlarger than unity, the spurious term can be still much\nsmaller than the reservoir term Rin . The in-scattering\nrate Rin should compensate the losses \u03b3. If occupation\nnumbers are not large, the truncated Wigner is therefore\nstill expected to yield physical results if g/\u2206V \u226a \u03b3. Note\nthat the latter requirement coincides with the condition\n(34) derived from the full equation of motion (28).\nIf we neglect the collisional terms in Eq. (40), the\nsteady state solution is\nN (k) =\n\n1\n.\n[\u03b3 + Rout (\u01ebk )]/Rin (\u01ebk ) \u2212 1\n\n(43)\n\nThe simplest model that yields a temperature TR (that is\nin experiments typically higher than the lattice temperature) for the tail of the polariton momentum distribution\nis obtained by setting the out-scattering rate to zero\nRout (E) = 0,\nRin (E) \u221d \u03b3 exp(\u2212E/TR ).\n\n(44)\n(45)\n\nStudies of the Boltzmann equation [38] have however\nshown that the rates Rin and Rout both tend to incre-\n\n\f7\nasse as a function of the energy, approximately as\nRin \u221d exp(E/kB TR ),\nRout \u221d exp(2E/kB TR ).\n\n(46)\n(47)\n\nWe will see below that a nonzero out-scattering enhances\nfluctuations.\n\nVII.\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nThe stochastic motion equations can be simulated by\nMonte Carlo techniques. As we have already mentioned\nin the introduction, the nonequilibrium condition of the\npolariton condensates makes that the effect of the reservoir on the correlation functions cannot be characterized\nby the temperature alone. We will discuss below two\nother physical quantities that determine the degree of\ncoherence in the polariton condensate: the feedback parameter \u03b1 and the out-scattering rate Rout . The other\nparameters, we keep fixed for all simulations: m/~ =\n1\u03bcm\u22122 meV\u22121 , g/~ = 0.03\u03bcm2 and kB TR = 2meV. The\nsimulations were done on a 32 \u00d7 32 point grid with physical dimension of 66 \u00d7 66\u03bcm2 and periodic boundary conditions.\nFigs. 2 and 3 illustrate single Monte-Carlo realizations of the classical field \u03c8(x). Even though these images have strictly speaking no direct physical meaning,\nthey already illustrate qualitatively the coherence properties of the polariton condensate. Fig. 2 shows two\nexamples for a finite excitation spot for pump intensities\nbelow (panels a and b) and above the threshold (panels\nc and d). At low density, both the density and phase\nfluctuations are large, whereas the phase fluctuations are\nclearly suppressed in the high density regime. Panel (d)\nshows that phase coherence exists all over the extent of\nthe excitation region. The concentric phase profile originates from the repulsive polariton-polariton interaction\nthat causes an outward flow of polaritons [10].\nFigure 3 shows snap shots of the polariton density and\nphase for a uniform pump below and slightly above the\nthreshold. The phase profile of panel (d) shows that the\nphase ordering is only partial. Vortex-anti vortex pairs\nappear to exist at densities well above the stimulation\nthreshold. This is an indication that the physics of the\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type could occur in polariton condensates.\nThree momentum distributions for increasing pump intensity are shown in Fig. 4. As expected, our model\nshows the build up of a large occupation of the low momentum states for increasing pump intensity. The momentum distributions appear to be rather well fitted by\na Bose-Einstein function (full line). It is important to\nmention here the important role of the reservoir relaxation rates. We have chosen them in such a way that a\nthermal distribution is obtained even in the absence of\ncollisions between lower polaritons. In simulations with\nenergy independent relaxation rates (not shown) and a\n\nFIG. 2: Snapshots of a single Monte Carlo realization of the\ndensity (upper panels) and phase (lower panels) for a finite\nsize excitation spot with intensity below (left hand panels)\nand above threshold (right hand panels).\n\nFIG. 3: Snapshots of a single Monte Carlo realization of the\ndensity (a,c) and phase (b,d) for excitation parameters below\n(a,b) and above threshold (c,d).\n\nlarge, yet realistic [42] polariton-polariton interaction\nstrenth, we have obtained a constant instead of exponential decay at large momenta.\nNote that the temperature extracted from the fits of\nthe tails to a Maxwellian is lower than the reservoir temperature TR (2 meV for the present simulations), that\n\n\f8\n\n(a)\n\n0.3\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u22120.1\n\n\u22120.1\n\ng(1)\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n0\n\n5\n\n5\n\n15\n\n5\nT=1.1 meV\n\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n\nT = 1.73 meV\n\nN\n\nT=2 meV\n\n0.2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n(b)\n\n0.3\n\nT=2 meV\n\n0.2\n\ng(1)\n\nenters the rates Rin,out according to Eq.

Keeping \u03b1 = 0.01\u03bcm\u22121 as in Fig. 5,\nbut including some out-scattering, the coherence in panel\n(a) is dramatically decreased. As compared to the simulations of Fig. 5, the effect of \u03b1 is much more pronounced.\nFor the smallest value of \u03b1, the temperature of 5.5 meV\nfor which the spatial coherence is reasonably well fitted,\nis much larger than the one that is extracted from the tail\nof the momentum distribution (less than 1 meV): the polariton condensate behaves in this regime very different\nfrom the ideal Bose gas.\n25\n\n25\n\n(a)\n\n20\n\ng(1)\n\nThe subtle features of long range coherence are much\nclearer in the Fourier transform of the momentum distribution, i.e. the first order spatial coherence function. In\nFig. 5 two values of \u03b1 are compared. Below the condensation threshold, the gain saturation parameter \u03b1 (see Eq.\n(39)) has no influence and the fit of the coherence by\nthe g (1) of the noninteracting Bose gas yields the reservoir temperature of 2 meV. For the simulation above the\nthreshold, a higher value of \u03b1 improves the long range coherence. Both spatial coherence functions are relatively\nwell fitted by the one of a noninteracting Bose gas. Both\ntemperatures are below the reservoir temperature. The\nlowest effective temperature is obtained for the largest\nfeedback parameter \u03b1.\nIn the simulations of Fig. 5, the out-scattering was\nset to zero. In the simulations presented in Fig. 6, we\nhave included this effect. In order to avoid exceedingly\nlarge rates in the model, we have put a cutoff in the\nmagnitude of Rout as Rout (E) = min[e2E/TR , 3.3meV].\nThe in-scattering rate was chosen Rin (E) = [Rout (E) +\n\u03b3]e\u2212E/TR .\nFig. 6 shows that the out-scattering has a big effect\non the coherence function.

Simulatios with \u03b1 = 0.01\u03bcm2 (a) and\n\u03b1 = 0.1\u03bcm2 (b) are shown.\n\nAnother quantity of great physical interest is the\nsecond order coherence function g (2) (x, t; x\u2032 , t\u2032 ) =\nh\u03c8 \u2020 (x, t)\u03c8 \u2020 (x\u2032 , t\u2032 )\u03c8(x\u2032 , t\u2032 )\u03c8(x, t)i, that quantifies the\ndensity fluctuations. Experimentally, the equal position\nsecond order coherence was investigated, in Ref. [17] for\nequal times t = t\u2032 and in Ref. [5] as a function of the\ndelay t \u2212 t\u2032 . Within the Wigner formalism, different time\ncorrelation functions are not straighforwardly calculable,\nso we present here only results for the equal time second\norder coherence.\nResults of the equal position second order coherence\ng (2) (0) \u2261 g (2) (x, t; x, t) are shown in Fig. 7, for several\n\n\f9\nmicrocavity within the truncated Wigner approximation.\nThanks to the polariton losses our model remains physical in the low density regime and allows to describe the\n2.2\n\n2\n\n\u03b1=0.01 \u03bcm ; R =0\nout\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1.8\n(2)\n\n2\n\nR\n\n2E/T\n\n\u03b1=0.1 \u03bcm ; R =e\nout\n\nR\n\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n\ng/5\n\n1\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\u22122\nn(\u03bcm )\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\nFIG. 7: Second order coherence function as a function of the\ntotal density obtained for different excitation powers and the\nsimulation parameters indicated in the legend.\n\npolariton condensate at all densities. Our equations were\nshown to reduce to the Boltzmann equation in the low\ndensity regime below threshold. Above threshold, the\nequations were analyzed numerically with Monte Carlo\nsimulations. The first and second order spatial coherence\nwere shown to depend dramatically on the feedback from\nthe condensate on the reservoir (the gain saturation) and\non the collisions with reservoir excitons that knock polaritons out of the condensate. Within our model, the\ndensity fluctuations can show nonmonotonous behavior\nas a function of the polariton density. We predict that\nan increase in density fluctuations is accompanied by a\ndecrease in the spatial coherence.\nFinally, the vortex defects in individual Monte Carlo\nrealizations of the polariton field show that the spatial\ncoherence is limited by the spontaneous appearance of\nvortex defects in the phase. A further study of the role\nof vortices is necessary to understand their effect on the\nspatial coherence.\n\nIX.\nVIII.\n\n2E/T\n\n\u03b1=0.01 \u03bcm ; R =e\nout\n\ng (0)\n\nparameter values. As expected, g (2) (0) approaches the\nvalue 2 of the incoherent Bose gas in the low density\nregime. For increasing polariton densities, the second\norder coherence decreases, but its actual value depends\nagain strongly on the chosen parameter values. A larger\nvalue of the feedback parameter \u03b1, suppresses the density fluctuations. This is in agreement with the model\ndescribed in Ref. [5], where the density fluctuations are\nproportional to the saturation density (large saturation\ndensity means small feedback from the condensate on\nthe reservoir). Fig. 7 also shows that the out-scattering\nincreases the density fluctuations. This dependence is\nexpected, because adding the knock out processes leaves\nthe deterministic term in the evolution equation for the\nclassical field unaltered, but increases the fluctuations.\nNote that the density fluctuations are within our model\nnot always monotonous, but for some parameter values\nshow a minimum value slightly above threshold. Nonmonotonous behavior of g (2) (0) was also observed in experiments on polariton condensation in CdTe microcavities [17]. Also in the theoretical work of Ref. [39, 40]\nbased on a Boltzmann equation for the excited states coupled to a master equation for the condensate mode, an\nincrease of density fluctuations above the threshold was\nfound. It is however important to mention that in Fig. 7\nthe interaction energy is very large when g (2) (0) increases\nagain (1 meV blue shift due to condensate-condensate\ninteractions alone). When the value of the blue shift is\nreduced to 0.2 meV, g (2) (0) is found to be very close to\none.\nWe want to point out that we have not found any\nregime with good long range spatial coherence and large\ndensity fluctuations. Indeed, Fig. 6 (a) shows that at\nthe density n \u2248 20\u03bcm\u22122 the spatial coherence is, although longer than the thermal de Broglie wave lenth\ncorresponding to TR , limited to about 10 \u03bcm. Physically\nit is actually not expected that good spatial coherence\nand strong density fluctuations can go together, because\nphase fluctuations are coupled to the density fluctuations\nthrough the interaction and kinetic energy. So far, in the\nexperiments on CdTe microcavities where the increase of\ng (2) (0) as a function of pump power was observed, no decrease in spatial coherence was seen. It is possible that\nthe distance at which the spatial coherence was probed\nis too short for the decrease in spatial coherence to be\ndetectable, but we cannot exclude other explanations in\nterms of extrinsic experimental effects. The measured\ndensity fluctuations could for example contain a component due to intensity fluctuations in the excitation laser.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have derived classical field equations for a nonresonantly excited polariton condensate in a semiconductor\n\nIt is a pleasure to acknowledge numerous stimulating\nand insightful discussions with I.
