However, because an abundance of defects is ever-present at\nlarger scales [2] , great efforts have been devoted to produce defect-free structures applicable to\ndevices [3;4;5;6] .\nThe challenge of finding efficient ways to organize BCP films has been addressed by combining\nself-assembly at the nanometric scale with top-down approaches used to facilitate large-scale film\norganization [3] . Among other techniques, this has been achieved by modulating the substrate\nenergy using e-beam lithography pre-patterning [5;6] or using a BCP underlayer [4] . The epitaxy\nonto the surface periodic structure guides BCP lamellae along patterns such as bends or curves [5;6] .\nHowever, epitaxy requires the same spatial resolution as that of the expected device.\nGraphoepitaxy is another technique where a substrate topography is created in order to control\nthe BCP domain orientation. Because of topographical constraints, BCP ordered regions are\nobtained over micrometers [7;8] , but the process has to be repeated for each new sample.\nNano Imprint Lithography (NIL) has been proposed in the mid-nineties [9] and consists in first\nembossing a molten polymer film above its glass transition temperature Tg with a mold exhibiting\nmicro-scale features (Fig. 1), which is produced only once but can be re-used over 1000 times.\n\n1\n\n\fThen, the combined substrate/film/mold is cooled down below Tg and the film is separated from\nthe weakly adhering fluorocarbon-coated mold. NIL has been widely used for homopolymers [10;11] .\nHowever, BCP films were studied only in a few cases\n\n[12;13;14]\n\nand no attempt to organize defectless\n\nperpendicular structures over large distances (tens of micrometers) was reported. The ease of\nimplementation and low cost of the method present tremendous advantages as compared to other\ntechniques such as 193 nm deep UV, electron or focused ion beam lithography. [15]\nIn this work, we demonstrate how nano-rheology of the confined BCP film\n\n[7;16;17]\n\nand surface\n\ninteractions due to the mold are used to control nano-structures, enabling unprecedented defectfree film ordering on the wafer scale. Hence, the flexibility of mold design provides an efficient\ntop-down way to tailor BCP patterns transferrable onto a silicon substrate. In particular, NIL\nproduces patterns in complex geometries that are hardly reachable using state-of-the-art fabrication methods, and can lead to a wealth of applications for integrated high-density devices such as\nmagnetic memories, crossbar circuits and metamaterials.\nSymmetric diblock copolymers of PS52K -b-PMMA52K with polydispersity index of 1.09 were\npurchased from Polymer Source Inc and exhibit a bulk lamellar phase of period L0 = 49 nm [5] .\nHigh-energy silicon wafers are cleaned and coated with a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of\noctadecyltrichlorosilane. A UV/ozone treatment of the SAM is used to modify the surface energy\nand to induce perpendicular orientation of the BCP lamellae with respect to the substrate [18] .\nFinally, thin BCP films are spin-coated on the modified wafer, nanoimprinted and examined with\nSEM.\nFor samples processed at low temperatures of about T = 110 \u2212 120\u25e6 C, defect-free lamellae\nhaving a periodicity of \u2248 L0 (Figs. 2 a and b) are observed and are oriented parallel to the\ngroove edges over tens of micrometers. Self-consistent field theory (SCFT) calculations [19;20] (see\nSupporting Information) in a three-dimensional geometry mimicking the experimental substrate\nand mold (Fig. 1) support the experimental findings and are shown in Fig. 3. This agreement\nbetween theory and experiment strengthens our claim that, in this low temperature case, the\nobserved overall orientation is determined by the surface energy. Furthermore, if the substrate has\nno preference for one of the two blocks and the mold has a slight preference for one of them, wellordered lamellae oriented perpendicular to the substrate and parallel to the grooves (Figs.2a, 2b\n\n2\n\n\fand 3) are found. Indeed, for thin enough grooves in the y direction (\u03c9h . 30L0 ), the interaction\nwith the mold side-walls prevails and is the main driving force for the orientation of the lamellae. [20]\nSurprisingly, for samples processed at higher temperatures of around 170\u25e6 C the lamellae are\nfound to be perpendicular to the groove edges (Fig. 2c). This finding cannot be solely explained\nby equilibrium film considerations. The organization of BCP around a mold tip (Fig. 2d) suggests similar directed flow streamlines and points to important rheological effects that have been\npreviously noticed for cylinders oriented parallel to the substrate [14] .\nThe rheology of BCP melts has attracted considerable attention since the 1970's due to its\nparticular relevance to extrusion [17;21] . Using the lubrication approximation (see Supporting Information), the film flow is expressed in terms of the shear rate \u03b3\u0307, which is proportional to\nP yLA /(\u03b7\u03c9l2 ), where P is the applied pressure, LA the initial film thickness, \u03b7 the film viscosity,\nand y the distance from the zero velocity plane (Fig. 1c). The maximum shear rate is obtained\nat the groove walls (y = \u00b1\u03c9l /2, z = Ll ) and (y = \u00b1\u03c9l /2, z = 0). For low shear rates (less than\n\u2248 1 s\u22121 ), it was shown both in experiments [21;22] and in numerical simulations [23;24] that the\nlamella normals are parallel to the shear gradient; namely, the lamellae are expected to be parallel\nto the substrate.\nHowever, for higher shear rates the orientation of the lamella normals is perpendicular both to\nthe shear gradient and to the flow direction, meaning that the lamellae are perpendicular to both\nthe substrate and groove walls. With typical thickness and width values, LA =50 nm, \u03c9l =500 nm,\nand applied pressure P = 1.5 \u00d7 106 Pa, we estimate the maximum shear rate to be \u03b3\u0307 \u2248 0.1 s\u22121\nat 110\u25e6 C (viscosity \u03b7 \u2248 2 \u00d7 107 Pa.s) and \u03b3\u0307 & 100 s\u22121 at 170\u25e6 C (\u03b7 \u2248 2 \u00d7 104 Pa.s). This means\nthat a lamellar orientation perpendicular to the groove walls is expected at 170\u25e6 C, as it is indeed\nobserved (Figs. 2c, 2d and 4)\nFull three-dimensional SCFT calculations show that a lamellar orientation parallel to the\ngrooves is obtained when the film initial condition is in the disordered state (above ODT) (Fig.\n3a). However, when we take the lamellae to be oriented perpendicular to the grooves as an initial\ncondition which mimicks the polymer flow, the system keeps this orientation although it has a\nhigher free energy (Fig. 3b). This suggests that a perpendicular orientation is not eventually\ndestroyed by surface energy but rather is a metastable state of the system. We conclude that\n\n3\n\n\fboth film nano-rheology and surface energy are important in determining the BCP organization\nas shown in (Fig. 2e). In this latter case, the small width of the grooves implies a relatively\nlarge contribution to the surface energy of the vertical walls, leading to parallel orientation inside\nthe grooves, whereas random orientation (with a preference to perpendicular orientation) is found\nclose to the groove walls.\nThe competing effects of surface energy and nano-rheology provide a unique way to control\nand design nano-structures on silicon wafers. Large scale defect-free orientation of the lamellae\ncan be reached by using a dedicated mold geometry to control the flow. This can be achieved by\ninjecting polymer with large shear rate into the mold grooves in places where an orientation of\nthe lamellae perpendicular to the walls is desired, while reducing the polymer flow in places where\nparallel orientation is needed. This is illustrated in Fig. 2f where the polymer flows from the\nlighter colored thinner regions to the central darker and thicker one. The upper downward flow\nreaches the thicker zone with a much higher shear rate than the lateral flow because the upper\ninjection region has a much larger extension than the lateral ones (the shear rate increases with\nthe y coordinate, see Eq.(4) in SI). Surface energy effects are designed to reinforce the flow effect\nsince the lateral side walls were made longer than the upper wall.\nFlow is in fact particularly efficient for obtaining defect-free structures because of its long-range\neffect while surface energies represent a short-range one. Moreover, as the viscosity and shear rate\ncan be varied over orders of magnitude (\u03b7 \u2248 104 to 107 Pa.s.) by changing the temperature over\n\u223c 50\u25e6 C only, both effects can be furthermore combined. In Fig. 2f a high-temperature step\ncausing defect healing was added to a low-temperature step used for pre-ordering at the walls.\nNamely, after a first step of 2 minutes at 150\u25e6 C for evaporating fully the solvent, a pre-ordering\nstep was performed at 120\u25e6 C for 7 hours followed by a defect healing step at 170\u25e6 C for 72 hours.\nA force of 10 kN was applied onto the 4 inches wafer.\nOur NIL method provides a versatile approach to order BCP nanostructures in various geometries. In Fig. 4 we show a radial ordering which is induced by a flow in a system of cylindrical\nsymmetry. A mold with concentric grooves features was created and is shown in Fig. 4b. The\nremarkable radial ordering of the lamellae was obtained by a high temperature step to favor longrange ordering by the flow. This possibility of imprinting circular geometries is of great advantage\n\n4\n\n\ffor applications such as circular reading tracks for ultra-high density bit patterned media (BPM)\nproposed for magnetic storage disks [25] . Our present scheme can indeed create ultra-dense circular\nfeatures (the density is fully tunable by the polymer molecular weight) perpendicular to a magnetic head motion (Fig. 4c). This is fully compatible with actual rotating magnetic disk, unlike\nother approaches that lead to patterns that are orthogonal in the x-y directions.\nIn conclusion we have demonstrated a simple way to generate and tailor defect-free nanostructures at the 10 nm resolution. Long-range nano-rheology and shorter-range surface energy effects\ncan be efficiently combined to provide dedicated pattern geometries. For further applications\nthe BCP patterns processed by NIL will play the role of an intermediate mask or of a template.\nWe have successfully checked that such a BCP film can be transferred onto a silicon wafer by\nReactive Ion Etching (see Supporting Information). In the future we foresee that metals can\nalso be included into BCP structures using, for example, deposition of metallic layers onto prepatterned templates [26] , electrodeposition [27] and immersion in aqueous metal-salt solution [28] .\nWhen processed by our cost-effective NIL method, hybrid ordered nanostructures could provide a\nwealth of applications for ultra-high density magnetic recording media [27] , metal nano-structures\nfor metamaterials and plasmonic circuits, sensors [29] and memories [30] .\n\nExperimental\nSurface Modification of Silicon Substrates: Silicon wafers (p-type, 500 \u03bcm thick, purchased from\nMEMC Elect. Materials) were cleaned by sonication in purified Millipore water and 2-propanol,\nfollowed by exposure to UV under an oxygen atmosphere for 30 min. The cleaned wafers were\nsilanized in a 2mM solution of octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) in heptane for 1 day. The wafers\nwere put onto a heat plate at 100\u25e6 C for 5 min, then sonicated in toluene and dried with nitrogen\nbefore UV/ozone treatment.\nSurface Energy Control: The SAM is subsequently oxidized to obtain the desired surface-energy\nvalue through UV/ozone treatment as previously shown in earlier work [18] .\nPolymer Film Deposition : 1 wt % solution of diblock copolymer of PS52K-b-PMMA52K, (Polymerization index:1.09) of symmetric composition (purchased from Polymer Source Inc.) in toluene\nwas spin coated at 1800 rpm onto the silanized silicon wafer, in order to produce a BCP films with\n\n5\n\n\fthickness of about 40-50 nm. Subsequently, the samples were annealed in a vacuum oven with a\npressure less than 30 mbar at 170\u25e6 C for 1 day.\nNanoImprinting Procedure : Imprint experiments have been carried out using an EVG@520HE\npress under vacuum of about 0.1 mbar. The mold used was a 4in. silicon wafer with engraved\nnano-structures of 50 nm in height and between 250 nm and 8 \u03bcm in width. An overall pressure\nof 1.5 MPa was then applied to all samples at temperatures of 120\u25e6 C (samples of Figs. 2a and 2b)\nor 170\u25e6 C (samples of Figs. 2c-2e) during 18h. Critical Dimension Scanning Electron Microscopy\n(CD-SEM) were performed using a Hitachi 9300 instrument operating at low voltage (500 V).\n\nAcknowledgements\nFunding from Chimtronique and Nanosciences programs of the CEA, the network for advanced\nresearch \"Triangle de la Physique\" (POMICO project), the U.S.-Israel Binational Science Foundation under Grant No. 2006/055, the Israel Science Foundation under Grant No. 231/08, and the\nCenter for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology at Tel Aviv University is gratefully acknowledged.\n\nReferences\n[1] Bates, F. and Fredrickson, G.

(a) The geometry of a teflon-coated mold made of silicon.\n(b) The mold is pressed at a temperature above Tg against a BCP film in its lamellar phase preoriented perpendicular to a substrate. (c) Nano-rheology in the film plays an important role at\nhigh shear rates obtained for higher temperatures, and (d) the resulting lamellae are oriented\nperpendicularly to both the bottom substrate and the grooves. (e) When surface energy effects\ndominate, the lamellae are oriented perpendicular to the substrate and parallel to the grooves.\n\n10\n\n\fFigure 2: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of PS52K \u2212b\u2212PMMA52K diblock copolymer\nfilms after NIL processing. (a),(b) Processing at T = 120\u25e6 C with parallel alignment in the thick\ndarker regions. The 50 nm lamellar period is clearly visible in (b). (c)-(f) Processing at T = 170\u25e6\nC. In (c) orientation perpendicular to the grooves is clearly visible (see also Fig. 4). In (d)\nthe perpendicular orientation of the lamellar phase around a tip suggests a similar orientation of\nflow streamlines. In (e) the small groove width leads to a large surface-energy effect and parallel\norientation of the thickest (lighter) regions, whereas random orientation (that, nevertheless, mainly\nstarts perpendicular to the walls), is observed for the lower (darker) regions. In (f) both surface\neffects and dominant flow from the upper part of the groove contribute to a perfect parallel\norientation.\n\n11\n\n\fFigure 3: Three-dimensional SCFT simulations of a BCP film in a NIL setup. (a) Starting from\na disordered system, the simulations converge to lamellae oriented parallel to the groove. (b)\nStarting from a perpendicular orientation, the system stays in the this state, though with higher\nfree energy.\n\nFigure 4: (a) SEM top-view picture of concentric circles imprinted in a PS-PMMA BCP film\nshowing a perpendicular organization of the BCP film with respect to the circular tracks.
