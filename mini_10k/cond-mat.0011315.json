By comparing with results of numerical computations using the random-phase approximation we show that our analytical approach\nprovides a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the optical spectrum.\n\nOptical spectra of finite metallic systems have been\nintensively investigated for almost a century. Early approaches such as Mie's [1] are of classical nature. In [1]\nthe absorption of electro-magnetic radiation by conducting spheres is determined. It is shown that\n\u221a the absorption spectrum exhibits a resonance at \u03c9p / 3 (where \u03c9p\nis the bulk plasma frequency) due to collective motion of\nthe charge carriers.\nIn the last decades there has been a substantial amount\nof work on the nature of such collective resonances in\nmetallic clusters [2], nuclei [3], thin films [4\u20136], small\nmetal particles [7], and dimensionally reduced quantum systems [8\u201310] investigating, in particular, quantummechanical effects. In most of these cases, the electron dynamics is ballistic (the mean free path l is larger\nthan the system size a). The majority of theoretical papers on the Mie resonance of finite metallic systems use\nthe so-called random phase approximation (RPA), a selfconsistent, quantum-mechanical approach incorporating\ncollective effects. The nature of the Mie resonance in finite electronic quantum systems is well understood, both\nqualitatively and quantitatively (for a recent review see\nfor instance [2]).\nThe emergence of the field of Mesoscopic Physics has\nfueled an increased interest in the electronic and optical properties of finite, disordered quantum systems\n(with diffusive electron dynamics, l \u226a a) in external\nfields. In this context, attention has largely focussed on\n(quasi-)static properties, \u03c9 \u2243 \u2206/~, where \u2206 is the mean\nlevel spacing of the system in question (which is generally smaller than \u03c9p by many orders of magnitude).\nMesoscopic fluctuations of the static polarisability and\nthe capacitance, for instance, were characterised in [11],\nand the electron density itself in [12]. In all of these\ncases, collective effects must be taken into account in order to adequately deal with the screening of the external\nfield. In the static limit, a Thomas-Fermi (TF) ansatz is\nappropriate [11,12].\n\nMuch less is known about optical spectra in the lowfrequency region \u2206/~ < \u03c9 \u226a \u03c9p , despite the fact that\nthis regime is of particular interest: one expects that\nthe spectra strongly depend on the nature of the (singleparticle) electron dynamics: In ballistic systems, for example, it was argued [13] that optical spectra should exhibit resonances near multiples of \u03c9c = \u03c0vF /a (see also\n[14]). Usually \u2206/~ \u226a \u03c9c \u226a \u03c9p . According to [13], these\nresonances should overlap to give a linear frequency dependence of the absorption coefficient for \u03c9 \u226b \u03c9c in twodimensional systems (classical and local electro-magnetic\ntheories predict a quadratic dependence independent of\ndimension). These are striking and unexpected results.\nThey were, however, obtained within a TF approximation which is valid in the static limit. It must be examined to which extent dynamic screening effects may\nmodify the results [15].\nFurthermore, in systems with ballistic chaotic dynamics, the optical spectra should, at least within a singleparticle picture, reflect universal energy-level correlations\nfound in classically chaotic quantum systems [16]. This\nissue was addressed in the seminal paper by Gorkov and\nEliashberg [17], investigating the polarisability of metallic particles with disordered walls. However, the treatment neglects screening effects all together [18\u201320]. How\ndoes dynamical screening modify this picture?\nNumerical calculations (based, for instance on the\nRPA) are ill-suited to answer these questions: They provide little qualitative insight in the low-frequency region\nand, more importantly, it is necessary to consider small\nsystems or to make use of symmetries in order to make\nthe numerical computations feasible. Disordered and\n(asymmetric) chaotic systems are very difficult to deal\nwith. In order to understand how the classical singleparticle dynamics is reflected in optical spectra of finite\nquantum systems, it is thus greatly desirable to have an\nanalytical theory incorporating collective effects.\nThe main result of this paper is an analytical expres1\n\n\fsion for the absorption properties for a two-dimensional\nelectron gas confined to a strip of width a [eqs. (14) and\n(15)]. This example exhibits all features of more complicated geometries. However, in the case discussed here,\nnumerical RPA calculations are feasible and allow us to\ndiscuss the accuracy of the analytical approach.\nIn the following it is assumed that \u2206/~ < \u03c9 \u226a\n\u03c9p , EF /~ where EF is the Fermi energy. It is furthermore assumed that \u03bb, \u03bbs \u226b a \u226b \u03bbF where \u03bb is the wave\nlength of the external radiation, \u03bbs is the skin depth and\n\u03bbF is the Fermi wave-length.\nWe consider a closed metallic quantum system placed\nin an external electric field E ext [with a time dependence\n\u221d exp(i\u03c9t)]. If the wave-length is much larger than the\nsystem size a, the external field is approximately constant\nthroughout the system and (neglecting retardation effects) can be written as the gradient of an electric potential \u03c6ext (r) = E0 x\u00eax [r = (x, y, z) is a three-dimensional\ncoordinate vector]. Within the RPA, the electronic response of the system to E ext is calculated by solving a\nset of self-consistent equations for the effective electrical\npotential \u03c6(r) = \u03c6ext (r) + \u03b4\u03c6(r) [\u03b4\u03c6(r) is the potential\ndue to the induced charge density \u03b4\u033a(r)]\nZ\n\u03b4\u03c6(r) = dr \u2032 G(r, r \u2032 )\u03b4\u033a(r \u2032 ) ,\n(1)\nZ\n\u03b4\u033a(r) = \u2212 dr\u2032 \u03a00 (r, r\u2032 ; \u03c9) \u03c6(r)\n\nelectronic quantum system in an external electric field,\nvalid in the frequency range \u2206/~ < \u03c9 \u226a \u03c9p . We make\nuse of the approximations suggested in [21]. First, according to Fermi's golden rule, the absorption coefficient\nis\n\u03b1(\u03c9) \u2243\n\n\u03c6 = \u2212\u03a0\u22121\n0 \u03b4\u033a .\n\nwhere \u03bdd is the density of states per unit volume in d\ndimensions and P (d) (r, r\u2032 ; \u03c9) is the Fourier transform of\nthe classical propagator P (d) (r, r \u2032 ; t). In ballistic systems\nit is written as a sum over classical paths p from r to r\u2032\n\n(2)\n\nP\n\nd(\u03c9) =\n\ndrdr\u2032 \u03b4\u033a\u2217 (r)\u03a00 (r, r \u2032 ; \u03c9)\u03c6(r \u2032 )\n\n(d)\n\n\u2032\n\n(r, r ; \u03c9) =\n\nX\n\ncl.paths p\n\n\u2202(r \u2032 )\ndet\n\u2202(\u03c4p , np )\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n\u22121\n\nexp(i\u03c9\u03c4p ) . (9)\n\nHere \u03c4p is the time taken from r to r\u2032 along the path\np, and np is a unit vector describing the direction of the\ninitial velocity. For diffusive systems see e.g. [29].\nIn the following we show by comparison with quantummechanical RPA calculations that (5-9) provide a qualitative and quantitative description of absorption in the\nfrequency range \u2206/~ < \u03c9 \u226a \u03c9p .\nTwo-dimensional strip. We consider a two-dimensional\nelectron gas confined to a strip in the x-y-plane surrounded by vacuum [30], subject to a time-dependent\nelectric field E ext directed along the negative x-axis [compare fig. 1(a)]. The width of the strip (along the x-axis)\nis a, its length L (along the y-axis), with L \u226b a. Within\nthe system, the electrons move ballistically, and they are\nspecularly reflected at the boundaries at x = \u00b1a/2.\n\n(3)\n\nwhere\nZ\n\n(7)\n\nwith \u03c6cl (r) \u2192 \u03c6ext (r) as |r| \u2192 \u221e and \u03c6cl = 0 within\nthe system (in the classical limit, the external field is thus\nscreened out completely). Eq. (7) may be solved for \u03b4\u033acl\nusing standard methods [27]. Fourth, \u03a00 is determined\nwithin a quasi-classical approximation [28,21]\nh\ni\n\u03a00 (r, r \u2032 ; \u03c9) = e2 \u03bdd \u03b4(r \u2212 r\u2032 ) + i\u03c9P (d) (r, r \u2032 ; \u03c9)\n(8)\n\ne is the electron charge, \u03b5\u03b1 and \u03c8\u03b1 (r) are the singleparticle eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the undisturbed system, they are usually calculated with in a\nHartree-Fock or a local-density approximation. f (\u03b5) =\n\u0398(EF \u2212 \u03b5), and \u03b3 > 0 is smaller than \u2206. Within the\nRPA, the absorption coefficient (proportional to the energy dissipation per unit time) may be written as [3]\n~\u03c9\nIm d(\u03c9)\n2E02\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n\u2206\u03c6cl = \u2212\u03b4\u033acl /\u01eb0\n\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\n\u03b1(\u03c9) =\n\n.\n\nIn order to determine \u03b4\u033a, eqs. (1) are usually solved numerically, using a real-space discretisation [26] or by expanding in a suitable basis set. An approximate analytical solution may be obtained by noting that for \u03c9 \u226a \u03c9p ,\n||G\u03a00 || \u226b 1.

Third, \u03c6 itself\nis determined within a quasi-classical approximation: according to (1), the effective electric potential is given by\n(in symbolic notation)\n\nwith the boundary condition that \u03b4\u03c6(r) vanishes as\n|r| \u2192 \u221e.

In fig. 2(b), we show quantum-mechanical\nRPA results in comparison with eqs. (14) and (15) and\nobserve excellent agreement. We observe prominent resonances in the absorption coefficient near odd multiples\nof \u03c9c , due to single-particle cyclotron orbits (electrons\nmoving in phase with the external field). This establishes that the single-particle resonances conjectured in\n[13] exist within the RPA. Their positions, strengths and\nshapes are very well described by (14). Eq. (15) and the\ninset of fig. 2(b) show that in the limit of large frequencies (\u03c9 \u226b \u03c9c ), the absorption coefficient is linear in \u03c9.\nIn the opposite limit (\u03c9 \u226a \u03c9c ) where the TF approach\nis adequate, it is quadratic.\nWe conclude that the quasi-classical approximation described above, for the parameters considered here, provides a quantitative description of the optical properties.\nThree-dimensional thin film. To conclude we discuss\n\u03c6 for a thin film [31] of width a in the y-z-plane subject to an external potential \u03c6ext (r) = E0 x\u00eax . The\nclassical charge density is concentrated at the boundary,\n\u03b4\u033acl (x) = \u00b1\u03b4\u03c3 \u03b4(x \u00b1 a/2). The corresponding static and\ndynamical contributions to \u03c6(x) are singular; we thus use\nthe TF charge density [6] instead of \u03b4\u033acl (appropriate in\nthe limit of small ks corresponding to high electron densities): \u03b4\u033aTF (x) = ks \u01eb0 E0 sinh(ks x)/ cosh(ks a/2). Here\nks2 = e2 \u03bd3 /\u01eb0 is the three-dimensional TF screening vector. The RPA equations are easily solved within a realspace discretisation. Our results for \u03c6(x) are shown in\nfig. 3, and compared to results of the analytical approach\nusing eqs. (5-9).\nWe have also calculated the absorption coeffcient for\n\u2206/~ < \u03c9 \u226a \u03c9p within the RPA. The analytical approach\nmust be used with caution in the case of the film since\nit requires that \u03c6 be smooth on the scale of \u03bbF . It turns\nout that \u03b1(\u03c9) is, to a good approximation, quadratic in\n\u03c9 as opposed to the two-dimensional case. As in d = 2\ndimensions we observe resonances near odd multiples of\n\u03c9c (not shown).\n\nthe RPA-equations (1) are reduced to a set of onedimensional equations for \u03c6(x, z = 0) with the kernel\n\u039b0 (x, x\u2032 ; \u03c9). We model the confinement in the x-direction\nby introducing hard-wall boundary conditions. This is\nadequate in the range of parameters considered below\nand simplifies the quasi-classical analysis. We solve the\nresulting self-consistent equations numerically using a\nreal-space discretisation and obtain the absorption coefficient from (3).\nThe corresponding quasi-classical approximation for\n\u03b1(\u03c9) is obtained as described above: the classical\nsurface-charge density is determined by solving (7) in\nelliptic cylinder coordinates: \u03b4\u03c3cl (x) = 2\u01eb0 E0 (a2 /4 \u2212\nx2 )\u22121/2 \u0398 (|x| \u2212 a/2). The corresponding classical field\nlines are shown in fig. 1(a). According to eqs. (8,9)\nthe one-dimensional kernel \u039b0 (x, x\u2032 ; \u03c9) is given by a sum\nover classical paths as shown in fig. 1(b) which may be\nsummed by Poisson summation. Using (6) one obtains\nfor the effective electric potential\nX\n\u03c6(x) =\n\u03c6\u03bc cos [\u03bc\u03c0 (x/a + 1/2)] ,\n(12)\n\u03bc>0\n\np\n\u0010 \u03bc\u03c0 \u0011 \u0010 \u03bc\u03c0 \u0011\n\u03c9 2\u2212\u03c9c2 \u03bc2\n2\u03c0\u01eb0 E0\np\n\u03c6\u03bc =\nsin\nJ1\n.\ne2 \u03bd2 \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9 2\u2212\u03c9c2 \u03bc2\n2\n2\n\nEq. (12) has an intuitive interpretation: neglecting a\ncorrection term \u03c6bdy (x) which is small except for x in\na boundary layer of width \u03b4x \u221d vF /\u03c9, eq. (12) can be\nwritten as a sum over two terms\n\u03c6 \u2243 \u03c6stat + \u03c6dyn\n\nodd\nX\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u03c6stat (x, z = 0) = (\u01eb0 qs )\u22121 \u03b4\u03c3(x) is the (linearised)\nTF potential (qs = e2 \u03bd2 /\u01eb0 is the two-dimensional TF\nscreening vector) and \u03c6dyn is a dynamical contribution\ncorresponding to a current building up the screening\ncharges. It obeys \u2202 2 \u03c6dyn /\u2202x2 = \u2212(me \u03c9 2 /e2 ) \u03b4\u03c3/\u03c30\nwhere me is the electron mass and \u03c30 is the areal charge\ndensity of the electrons.\nFig. 2(a) shows \u03c6(x) according to (12) and (13) compared with the results of a numerical RPA calculation.\nOne observes excellent agreement (and \u03c6bdy is small\nexcept at the boundary). Our results show that for\nlarger frequencies (\u03c9 > \u03c9c ), the dynamical potential\n\u03c6dyn makes a significant contribution to \u03c6 and dynamical\nscreening effects cannot be neglected.
