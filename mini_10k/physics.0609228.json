Other than the fact that the response in downtown Mexico varied considerably in a spatial sense [15], was quite intense and of very long duration at certain locations (as\nmuch as \u22483min [38]), and often took the form of a quasi-monochromatic signal with beatings [36], a\nremarkable feature of this earthquake (studied in [16, 6, 21, 22]) was that such strong motion could\nbe caused by a seismic source so far from the city (the epicenter was located in the subduction zone\noff the Pacific coast, approximately 350km from Mexico City). It is now recognized [6, 7] that the\ncharacteristics of the abnormal response recorded in downtown Mexico were partially present in the\nwaves entering into the city (notably 60km from the city as recorded by the authors of [16]) after\nhaving accomplished their voyage from the source, this being thought to be due to the excitation\nof Love and generalized-Rayleigh modes by the irregularities of the crust [6, 9, 16]).\nIn the present investigation (as well as in the companion paper), we focus on the influence of\nthe presence of the built features of the urban site as a complementary explanation of the abnormal\nresponse: the so-called city-site effect. A building or a group of buildings over a hard half-space,\nsolicited by a plane incident SH wave, has been shown to modify the seismic waves on the ground\nnear the building [46, 33], the modification being larger when more buildings are taken into account\nbecause of multiple-interaction: i.e., the so-called structure-soil-structure interaction. For models of\nthe geophysical structure involving only a hard half-space, the stress-free base block mode appears\nto be the main cause of the modification [33].\nThe studies that deal with a geophysical structure involving, in addition, a soft-layer overlying\nthe hard-half space, have been mainly concerned either with an infinite set of periodically-arranged\n[2, 4, 5] or randomly- arranged [32, 10] buildings on, or partially imbedded in, the ground. In\n[2], the authors suggest that the large duration and amplitude are strongly linked to resonant\nphenomena of the soft-layer associated with waves whose structure is close to that of Love waves.\nThe solicitation being of the form of a plane incident wave, such modes cannot be excited in the\nabsence of buildings [21].\nIn [31, 26], it was shown that the modes of a soft layer/hard half space can be excited when\nthe interface between the subtratum and the layer present some irregularities. These effects were\nqualified as \"vertical and lateral interferences\" in a previous numerical study [1]. The question of\nthe excitation of modes, via surface irregularities constituted by the set of buildings on the ground,\nwas subsequently addressed in [19]. In [49, 48] it was found that the excitation of vibration modes\nassociated with a periodically-modulated surface impedance, modeling a periodic distribution of\nblocks emerging from a flat ground, can lead to enhanced durations and amplifications of the\ncumulative displacement and velocity as compared to what is found for a flat stress-free or constant\nsurface impedance surface. The authors of [48] show that these modes manifest themselves by\namplified evanescent waves in the substratum.\nThe contributions [4, 5] employ homogeneized models of a periodic city, but the fact that these\nmodels are restricted to low frequencies may explain why they do not account for the amplifications\nobtained in [19] [48]. In a host of other numerical studies [32, 24, 8, 4, 5, 10, 13, 14], the presence of\nbuildings is found either to hardly modify, or to de-amplify, the seismic disturbance, in contradiction\nwith what is shown in [43, 47, 17].\nIn [39], the spatial variability of damage to structures on the ground was attributed to the\n4\n\n\fvariability of the resonance frequencies of the buildings and of the soil structure beneath each\nbuilding, with the implication that the most dangerous situation is when the natural frequency of the\nbuilding (often treated as a one degree (or several degrees) of freedom oscillator [29, 23, 10, 5, 40]) is\ncoincident with that (obtained by a 1D analysis) of the substructure below the base of the building\n(a well-known paradigm in the civil engineering community known as the double resonance).\nAnother point of view is to consider the building as a seismic source, either when it is solicited\nartificially by a vibrator located on its roof [28, 50], or when it re-emits vibrations received from the\nincident seismic disturbance (or other form of solicitation such as that coming from an underground\nnuclear explosion [44, 12]). It is not unreasonable to think that the presence of one or more buildings\non the ground enables the excitation of the (Love, Rayleigh) modes of the underground system.\nThis is known to be possible when a flat stress-free surface overlying a soft layer in welded contact\nwith a hard substratum is solicited by a source located in the layer or substratum [21] and should\ntherefore also occur when the source (i.e., the building) is on the free surface.\nThe present work originated in the observation that no satisfactory theoretical explanation\nhas been given until now of the influence of buildings on anomalous seismic response in urban\nenvironments with soft layers, or large basins, overlying a hard substratum. The principal reason\nfor this knowledge gap probably lies in the complexity of the sites examined in previous studies\nand in the complexity of the phenomena. Thus, it appears to be opportune to develop a theoretical\nmodel which is as complete and as simple as possible, on an idealized, although rather representative\nurban site, in order to address the following questions:\n(i) how should one account for the principal features of the seismic response in the cases of a\nrelatively small, and then, large number of blocks?\n(ii) what are the modes of the global structures (i.e. the superstructure plus the geophysical\nstructure) and what are the mechanisms of their excitation and interaction?\n(iii) what are the repercussions of resonant phenomena on the seismic response?\n(iv) what are the differences in seismic response between configurations with a small and a large\nnumber of blocks?\nThe investigation herein focuses on the seismic response of one and two blocks (the case of a\nperiodic set of blocks is considered in the companion parper) in welded contact with a soft layer\noverlying a hard half-space. The modal analysis of the whole configuration, backed up by extensive\nnumerical computations, shows that: i) the presence of one block induces the excitation of two\ntypes of modes, the first whose structure is close to that of a mode of the geophysical structure,\nand the second whose structure is close to that of a mode of the superstructure (i.e., the set of\nblocks, each of which is formed of one or several buildings), ii) the presence of more than one block\ngives rise to coupled modes resulting from a combination of the two other types of modes.\nWe uncover the mechanism of the (so-called soil-structure) interaction between the superstructure and the geophysical substructure. Despite the fact that differences are noticed between the\ncomputed displacements for a configuration with, and in the absence of, buildings, mainly consisting in a longer duration and a larger displacement in the building than at the same location in the\nabsence of the building, and in a modification, due to the presence of the block(s) of the structure\nof the waves traveling in the layer, no very pronounced effects are apparent in the case of only a\nfew (one or two) buildings. This could mean that the city-site effect is important only when a large\nnumber of buildings is accounted for. This case is investigated theoretically and numerically in the\ncompanion paper for a periodic arrangement of identical blocks.\n\n5\n\n\fFigure 1: View of a modern city with the underground.\n\n2\n\nDescription of the configuration\n\nWe focus on a portion of a modern city consisting of a set of blocks (see e.g., fig. 1 in which\nit will be noted that the blocks (i.e., buildings or groups of buildings) are not generally identical,\nnor arranged in periodic manner). The city has 2D geometry, with x3 the ignorable coordinate\nof a Ox1 x2 x3 cartesian coordinate system (see Fig. 2).\nThe buildings are assumed to be in\nwelded contact, across the flat ground surface, with the substructure. The latter is composed of a\nhorizontal soft layer underlain by a hard half space (see fig. 1). Each block is characterized by two\nconstants, its height bj and width wj , and all blocks have the same rectangular geometry (but not\nthe same sizes) and composition. Let dj be the x1 coordinate of the center of the base segment of\nthe j\u2212th block. The distance between the blocks j and i is denoted by dji = |dj \u2212 di | and is not\nnecessarily constant between successive pairs of blocks.\nFor the purpose of analysis, each block is homogenized (this does not mean that the set of blocks\nis reduced to a single horizontal, homogeneous layer, as in [4, 5]), so that the final aspect of the city\nis as in Fig. 3. Let B \u2208 Z denote the set of indices by which the blocks are identified (e.g., for three\nblocks: {1, 2, 3} or {\u22121, 0, 1}). The cardinal of B is designated by N (i.e., N denotes the number\nof blocks in the configuration, and this number will either be finite (in the following analysis) or\ninfinite (as in the companion paper).\n\u0393f is the stress-free surface composed of a ground portion \u0393g , assumed to be flat and horizontal,\nand a portion \u0393ag , constituting the reunion of the above-ground-level boundaries \u0393jag ; j \u2208 B of\nthe blocks. The ground \u0393G is flat and horizontal, and is the reunion of \u0393g and the base segments\n\u0393jbs ; j \u2208 B joining the blocks to the underground.\nThe medium in contact with, and above, \u0393f is air, assumed to be the vacumn (which is why \u0393f\nis stress-free). The medium in contact with, and below \u0393G is the mechanically-soft layer occupying\n6\n\n\fFigure 2: View of the 2D city (only two of the blocks are represented).\n\nFigure 3: View of the 2D city with homogenized blocks (only two of the blocks are represented).\n\n7\n\n\fFigure 4: Sagittal (x1 0x2 ) plane view of the 2D city with homogenized blocks (only two of the blocks\nare represented) solicited by a cylindrical wave radiated by a line source located at (xs1 , xs2 ) \u2208 \u03a90 .\n\nFigure 5: Sagittal (x1 0x2 ) plane view of the 2D city with homogenized blocks (only two of the\nblocks are represented) solicited by a plane wave with incident angle \u03b8 i .\n\nthe domain \u03a91 , which is laterally-infinite and of thickness h, and whose lower boundary is \u0393h , also\nassumed to be flat and horizontal. The soft material in the layer is in welded contact across \u0393h\nwith the mechanically-hard material in the semi-infinite domain (substratum) \u03a90 .\nThe domain of the j-th block is denoted by \u03a9j2 and the reunion of all the \u03a9j2 ; j \u2208 B is denoted\nby \u03a92 . The material in each block is in welded contact with the material in the soft layer across\nthe base segments \u0393jbs ; j \u2208 B.\nThe origin O of the cartesian coordinate system is on the ground, x2 increases with depth and\nx3 is perpendicular to the (sagittal) plane of the figs. 4-5. With ij the unit vector along the positive\nxj axis, we note that the unit vectors normal to \u0393G and \u0393h are \u2212i2 .\nS\nThe media filling \u03a90 , \u03a91 and j\u2208B \u03a9j2 are M 0 , M 1 and M 2 respectively and the latter are\nassumed to be initially stress-free, linear, isotropic and homogeneous (thus, each block, which is\ngenerally inhomogeneous, is assumed to be homogenized in our analysis). We assume that M 0 is\nnon-dissipative whereas M 1 and M 2 are dissipative, described by a constant quality factor Qj in\nthe frequency range of excitation.\nThe seismic disturbance is delivered to the site in the form of a shear-horizontal (SH) cylindrical\nwave (radiated by a line source parallel to the x3 axis and located in \u03a90 ; see fig. 4) or a plane\nwave (with incident angle \u03b8 i ; see fig. 5), propagating initially in \u03a90 (this meaning, that in the\nabsence of the layer, the city, and the air, the total field is precisely that associated with this\ncylindrical or plane wave). The SH nature of the incident wave (indicated by the superscript i\nin the following) means that the motion associated with it is strictly transverse (i.e., in the x3\ndirection and independent of the x3 coordinate). Both the SH polarization and the invariance of\nthe incident wave with respect to x3 are communicated to the fields that are generated at the site in\n8\n\n\fresponse to the incident wave. Thus, our analysis deals with the propagation of 2D SH waves (i.e.,\nwaves that depend exclusively on the two cartesian coordinates (x1 , x2 ) and that are associated\nwith motion in the x3 direction only).\nWe shall be concerned with a description of the elastodynamic wavefield on the free surface\n(i.e., on \u0393f ) resulting from the cylindrical or plane seismic wave sollicitation of the site.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nGoverning equations\nSpace-time framework wave equations\n\nIn a generally-inhomogeneous, isotropic elastic or viscoelastic medium M occupying R3 , the\nspace-time framework wave equation for SH waves is:\n\u2207 * (\u03bc(x, \u03c9)\u2207u(x, t)) \u2212 \u03c1(x)\u2202t2 u(x, t) = \u2212\u03c1(x)f (x, t) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwherein u is the displacement component in the i3 direction, f the component of applied force\ndensity in the i3 direction, \u03bc the Lam\u00e9 descriptor of rigidity, \u03c1 the mass density, t the time variable,\n\u03c9 the angular frequency, \u2202tn the n\u2212th partial derivative with respect to t, and x = (x1 , x2 ).

In addition,\nthe densities are positive real and we assume that substratum is a dissipation-free solid so that the\nrigidity therein is a positive real constant with respect to \u03c9, i.e., \u03bc0 (\u03c9) = \u03bc0 > 0.\n\n3.2\n\nSpace-frequency framework wave equations\n\nThe space-frequency framework versions of the wave equations are obtained by expanding the\nforce density and displacement in Fourier integrals:\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\n\u2212i\u03c9t\nm\nf (x, t) =\nf (x, \u03c9)e\nd\u03c9 , u (x, t) =\num (x, \u03c9)e\u2212i\u03c9t d\u03c9 , \u2200t \u2208 R ,\n(4)\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nso as to give rise to the Helmholtz equations\n\u2207 * \u2207um (x, \u03c9) + (km (\u03c9))2 um (x, \u03c9) = \u2212f (x, \u03c9)\u03b4m0 ; \u2200x \u2208 \u03a9m ; m = 0, 1 ,\nwherein\n\u03c9\n=\u03c9\nk (\u03c9) := m\nc (\u03c9)\nm\n\n9\n\ns\n\n\u03c1m\n.\n\u03bcm (\u03c9)\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n\fis the generally-complex wavenumber in M m .

In seismological applications involving viscoelastic media, the quality factor is usually considered to be either\nconstant or a weakly-varying function of frequency [13] in the bandwith of the source. We shall\ntherefore assume that Qj (\u03c9) = Qj , with Qj constants, j = 1, 2. It can be shown [30] that this\nimplies\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0013 2 arctan 1j\n\u0012\n\u03c0\nQ\n\u2212i\u03c9\n\u03bcj (\u03c9) = \u03bcjref\n; j = 1, 2 ,\n(17)\n\u03c9ref\nwherein: \u03c9ref is a reference angular frequency, chosen herein to be equal to 9 \u00d7 10\u22122 Hz.

Note should be taken of the fact that even though Qj , j = 1, 2 are non-\n\ndispersive (i.e., do not depend on \u03c9) under the present assumption, the phase velocities cj ; j = 1, 2\nare dispersive.\n\n3.5\nS\n\nBoundary and radiation conditions in the space-frequency framework\n\nThe translation of the stress-free (i.e., vanishing traction) nature of \u0393f = \u0393g\nj\nj\u2208B \u0393ag , is:\n\u03bc1 (\u03c9)\u2202n u1 (x, \u03c9) = 0 ; x \u2208 \u0393g ,\n\u03bc2 (\u03c9)\u2202n u2(j) (x, \u03c9) = 0 ; x \u2208 \u0393jag , j \u2208 B\n\nS\n\n\u0393ag , with \u0393ag :=\n(19)\n(20)\n\nwherein n denotes the generic unit vector normal to a boundary and \u2202n designates the operator\n\u2202n = n * \u2207.\nS\nThat M 1 and M 2 are in welded contact across \u0393bs := j\u2208B \u0393jbs is translated by the fact that\nthe displacement and traction are continuous across \u0393bs :\nu1 (x, \u03c9) \u2212 u2(j) (x, \u03c9) = 0 ; x \u2208 \u0393jbs , j \u2208 B\n\n(21)\n\n\u03bc1 (\u03c9)\u2202n u1 (x, \u03c9) \u2212 \u03bc2 (\u03c9)\u2202n u2(j) (x, \u03c9) = 0 ; x \u2208 \u0393jbs , j \u2208 B.\n\n(22)\n\n11\n\n\fThat M 1 and M 0 are in welded contact across \u0393h is translated by the fact that the displacement\nand traction are continuous across this interface:\nu1 (x, \u03c9) \u2212 u0 (x, \u03c9) ; x \u2208 \u0393h ,\n\n(23)\n\n\u03bc1 (\u03c9)\u2202n u1 (x, \u03c9) \u2212 \u03bc0 (\u03c9)\u2202n u0 (x, \u03c9) ; x \u2208 \u0393h .\n\n(24)\n\nu0 (x, \u03c9) \u2212 ui (x, \u03c9) \u223c outgoing waves ; kxk \u2192 \u221e, x2 > h .\n\n(25)\n\nThe uniqueness of the solution to the forward-scattering problem is assured by the radiation condition in the substratum:\n\n3.6\n\nBoundary and radiation conditions in the space-time framework\n\nSince our finite element method [18, 19, 17] for solving the wave equation in a heterogeneous\nmedium M (in our case, involving three homogeneous components, M 0 , M 1 and M 2 ) relies on the\nassumption that M be a continuum, it does not appeal to any boundary conditions except on \u0393f\nwhere the vanishing traction condition is invoked (fictitious domain method). Furthermore, since\nthe essentially unbounded nature of the geometry of the city cannot be implemented numerically,\nwe take this geometry to be finite and surround it (except on the \u0393f portion) by a perfectlymatched layer (PML) [11] which enables closure of the computational domain without generating\nunphysical reflected waves (from the PML layer). In a sense, this replaces the radiation condition of\nthe unbounded domain. The stress-free boundary condition on \u0393f is modeled with the help of the\nfictitious domain method [3], which allows us to account for the diffraction of waves by a boundary\nof complicated geometry, not necessarily matching the volumic mesh.\n\n3.7\n\nStatement of the boundary-value (forward - scattering) problem in the\nspace-time framework\n\nThe problem is to determine the time record of the displacement fields u1 (x, t) on \u0393g and\nu2(j) (x, t) on \u0393jag , j \u2208 B.\n\n3.8\n\nRecovery of the space-frequency displacements from the space-time displacements\n\nThe spectra of the displacements are obtained from the time records of the displacements by\nFourier inversion, i.e.,\nZ \u221e\n1\nuj (x, \u03c9) =\nuj (x, t)ei\u03c9t dt ; j = 1, 2 .\n(26)\n2\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\n\n4\n4.1\n\nField representations in the space-frequency framework for N <\n\u221e\nField in \u03a90\n\nIt is useful to consider the boundary \u2202\u03a90 of \u03a90 to be composed of \u0393h plus a semi-circle of\ninfinite radius \u0393\u221e joining \u0393h at x = (\u2212\u221e, h) and x = (\u2212\u221e, h).

When this happens, a natural mode\nof the configuration, comprising the blocks, the soft layer and the hard substratum, is excited,\nthis taking the form of a resonance with respect to B 0(n) (\u03c31 , \u03c9), i.e., with respect to a plane wave\ncomponent of the field in the substratum. As B 0 (k1 , \u03c9) is related to A1 (\u03c31 , \u03c9) and B 1 (\u03c31 ) via\n(53)-(55), the structural resonance manifests itself for the same \u03c31 and \u03c9 as concerns the field in\nthe layer.\nWe say that B 0(n) (\u03c31 , \u03c9), and the fields in the layer and substratum, can become possibly large\nat resonance because until now we have not taken into account the numerator N (n) (\u03c31 , \u03c9), which\nmight be small when the denominator is small, or such as to prevent, by other means, the fields in\n19\n\n\fthe layer and substratum from becoming large. Moreover, since the field is expressed as a sum of\nplane waves, the fact that B 0 (k1 , \u03c9) may become large for some k1\u22c6 , does not necessarily mean that\nthe sum of plane waves (including waves whose horizontal wavenumber k1 6= k1\u22c6 ), and therefore the\nfield, will be large at a resonance frequency.\n\n6.2\n\nB 0 (k1 , \u03c9) in the absence of the blocks\n\nThe easiest way to account for the absence of blocks is to take b = 0.

(80)\n\nWhat this result means is that the amplitude function B 0 (k1 , \u03c9) vanishes for all k1 except k1 = k1i ,\nand since (if we assume that there is no dissipation in the layer and substratum), \u03bc1 k21,i /\u03bc0 k20,i , k20,i ,\nk21,i , sin(k21,i h), cos(k21,i h) are real, the denominator in (79) cannot vanish (neither be small if there\nis a reasonable amount of dissipation in the layer and/or the substratum), which is another way of\nsaying that no structural resonances can exist when the configuration (without blocks) is excited by\na bulk plane wave.\nIn fact, it is easy to ascertain that the existence of structural resonances, in the case of the\nconfiguration without blocks, is tied up (when there is no dissipation in the layer and substrate)\nwith the possibility of k20 becoming pure imaginary, because then the denominator can effectively\nvanish (or become very small for a reasonable amount of dissipation in the layer and/or substratum).\nThis possibility is connected with the excitation of a Love mode, characterized by the simultaneous\nexistence of a surface wave (associated with pure imaginary k20 ) in the substratum, and a standing\nbulk wave (associated with pure real k21 ) in the layer.\n\n20\n\n\fTo make this more palpable, we introduce (79) into (39) so as to find\nio\nn h\n0,i\ni\nu (x, \u03c9) = S(\u03c9) exp i k1 x1 \u2212 k2 x2 +\n0\n\nS(\u03c9)\n\ncos(k21,i h) + i\n\n\u03bc1 k21,i\n\u03bc0 k20,i\n\nsin(k21,i h)\n\ncos(k21,i h) \u2212 i\n\n\u03bc1 k21,i\n\u03bc0 k20,i\n\nsin(k21,i h)\n\nn h\nio\nexp i k1i x1 + k20,i (x2 \u2212 2h)\n; \u2200x \u2208 \u03a90 , (81)\n\nwhich expresses the fact that the field in \u03a90 is the sum of the incident plane wave and a reflected\nplane wave for all k0 . Both of these waves are bulk waves (i.e., both of the cartesian components of\ntheir wavevectors are real for non-dissipative media) as opposed to the requirement of there being a\nsurface wave (i.e., whose x2 component is imaginary for non-dissipative media) in \u03a90 when a Love\nmode is excited. This means that it is impossible to excite a Love mode, in a configuration without\nblocks consisting of a soft layer overlying a hard halfspace, when the incident wave is a plane bulk\nwave.\nHowever, as shown in [21, 22], it is possible to excite a Love mode, in a configuration without\nblocks consisting of a soft layer overlying a hard halfspace, when the incident wave is a cylindrical\nwave radiated by a shallow source.\nIn the next section, we shall show that it is possible to excite something like a Love mode\nin a configuration consisting of a set of buildings in welded contact with a soft layer overlying a\nhard halfspace even when the incident wave is a plane bulk wave, the same being true when the\nsolicitation is a cylindrical wave.\n\n6.3\n\nQuasi Love modes\n\nLet us return to the denominator of the expression of B 0(n) , which, for convenience, we re-write\nin terms of k1 :\nD(k1 , \u03c9) = C(k1 , \u03c9) \u2212 k0 D(k1 , k1 , \u03c9)\n=\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03bc0 k20\n\u03bc1 k21\n1\n1\n1\n\u2212 i 0 0 sin(k2 h) \u2212 cos(k2 h) \u2212 i 1 1 sin(k2 h) \u00d7\n\u03bc k2\n\u03bc k2\n\u221e\n2(j)\n\u03bc2 k2m wj\ni X\n2(j)\n(j)\u2212\n(j)+\n\u01ebm\ntan(k2m bj )Im\n(k1 , \u03c9)Im\n(k1 , \u03c9) ; \u2200k1 \u2208 R , (82)\n0 k0\n2\u03c0\n\u03bc\n2\nm=0\n\ncos(k21 h)\n\nwherein it is easy to show that\n(j)\u00b1\nIm\n(k1 , \u03c9)\n\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u00b1k1 wj\nim \u00b1ik1 wj\n\u00b1k1 wj\nm\u03c0\nm\u03c0\nm\n2\nsinc\n=\ne\n+\n\u2212\n+ (\u22121) sinc\n,\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\n(83)\n\nsin(\u03b6)\n.\n\u03b6\n\n(84)\n\nwith\nsinc(\u03b6) :=\n\nSince C(k1 , \u03c9) := C(k1 , \u03c9) = 0 is the dispersion relation for (i.e., providing the means of determining the (k1 , \u03c9) couples leading to a possible resonance associated with the excitation of) Love\nmodes, we can say that (82) is the dispersion relation for quasi Love modes.\n21\n\n\fRemark 1\nQuasi Love modes are different from Love modes which, at present, means that the (k1 , \u03c9) couples\nfor which D(k1 , \u03c9) = 0 are not identical to the (k1 , \u03c9) couples for which C(k1 , \u03c9) = 0.\nRemark 2\nWhen b \u2192 0, the dispersion relation for quasi Love modes becomes the dispersion relation for Love\nmodes.\nRemark 3\n2(j)\nFor small k20 b, the quasi Love modes are a small perturbation of Love modes, which means here\nthat the (k1 , \u03c9) couples for which D(k1 , \u03c9) = 0 are close to the (k1 , \u03c9) couples for which C(k1 , \u03c9) = 0.\nRemark 4\nFor small \u03bc2 /\u03bc1 , the quasi Love modes are a small perturbation of Love modes, which means here\nthat the k1 , \u03c9 couples for which D(k1 , \u03c9) = 0 are close to the k1 , \u03c9 couples for which C(k1 , \u03c9) = 0.\nRemark 5\nFor small k2 w the quasi Love modes are a small perturbation of Love modes, which means here\nthat the k1 , \u03c9 couples for which D(k1 , \u03c9) = 0 are close to the k1 , \u03c9 couples for which C(k1 , \u03c9) = 0.\nRemark 6\nThe dispersion relation for quasi Love modes is independent of the number of blocks (provided this\nnumber is greater than 0).\nTo substantiate these remarks (when necessary) and obtain a more detailed picture of the features of the quasi Love modes as compared to those of the Love modes, we must analyze more\nclosely (82).

This term is significant only for small k1 wj /2 due to the sinc\nfunction whose modulus decays rapidly as its argument increases. Another feature of this term is\nthat it vanishes when k2 bj = l\u03c0 ; l = 0, 1, 2, ..., which occurs when the zeroth-order quasi-mode in\n2(j)\n\na block encounters a stress-free boundary condition at the base of the block (i.e. u,2\n\nx2 =0\n\n= 0),\n\nin which case the latter is disconnected from the underground (since no wave can penetrate into\nthe layer) from the point of view of the fundamental block quasi mode. This corresponds to the\nstress-free base block mode. It is then logical that this quasi mode of the block should not perturb\nthe dispersion characteristics of the mode of the whole configuration.\nThe analysis of the series term in {..} is more difficult. It is clear that a few terms of this\nseries should be retained, unless k2 b and/or k1 w are very small. The subsequent terms of the series\n2(j)\nbecome rapidly small (with m) due to the fact that tan(k2m bj ) \u223c i tanh(m\u03c0bj /wj ) \u2192 i ; m \u2192 \u221e\n4(k1 wj )2 i\n2(j)\n\u22123 ) ; m \u2192 \u221e.\nand k2m\n2 = O(m\n[(k1 wj )2 \u2212(m\u03c0)2 ]\nIn any case, it seems legitimate to adopt the following picture of what is going on: the base\nof a given block is a location where diffraction is produced resulting in incident (from either the\nblock into the underground or from the underground into the block) bulk waves being transformed\n(j)+\n(j)\u2212\ninto diffracted bulk and surface waves, as is testified by the presence of the terms Im and Im\nin the series, and by the fact that these diffraction effects disappear as the width of the base\nsegment goes to zero. Naturally, the presence of these locally-produced diffracted waves perturbs\nthe overall wave structure (with respect to what it was in the absence of the blocks) and therefore\nresults in a modification of the characteristics of the modes in the layer and substratum (which\nwere Love modes when the blocks were absent). This picture is consistent with the observation\nthat the diffracted waves are more difficult to produce when the base segment of a block appears\nas a stress-free surface due to the fact that either k2 bj = l\u03c0 ; l = 0, 1, 2, ... or \u03bc2 /\u03bc1 << 1.\nBeyond this, it is necessary to carry out a numerical study in order to see how the different\nparameters involved in the problem, notably those of the block, modify the dispersion characteristics\nof the modes of the configuration with respect to what these modes were (i.e., Love modes) in the\nabsence of the blocks. The numerical study should also seek to evaluate the modification of the\nresponse (notably on the ground) of the configuration due to the presence of blocks.\n\n6.4\n\nThe emergence of the natural modes of the configuration from the linear\n2(l)\nsystem of equations for Bm : quasi displacement-free base block modes\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(ll)\n2(l) (p)\nbecomes large when Cn \u2212 Dnn becomes small, and that\nEqs.(71)-(72) signify that Bn\n\u0011\n\u0010\n2(l) (p)\nbecomes inordinately large\nthis occurs at all orders p of approximation. The fact that Bn\nis associated with the excitation of a natural mode of the configuration. The equation Cn (\u03c9) \u2212\n(ll)\nDnn (\u03c9) = 0 is the dispersion relation of the n-th natural mode of the configuration.\nLet us examine this relation in more detail.\n2(l)\n\ni\u03bc2 k2n wl\n2(l)\ncot(k2n bl ) \u2212\n2\u03c0\u03bc0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\uf8ee\n\nIn(l)+ (k1 , \u03c9)In(l)\u2212 (k1 , \u03c9) \uf8f0\n23\n\n\u03bc0 k 0\n\ncos(k21 h) \u2212 i \u03bc1 k21 sin(k21 h)\ncos(k21 h) \u2212 i\n\n2\n\u03bc1 k21\n\u03bc0 k20\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fb dk1 = 0 , (88)\n0\nsin(k1 h) k2\n2\n\n\fwhich shows that the natural modes of the configuration result from the interaction of the fields in\ntwo substructures: the superstructure (i.e., block(s) above the ground), associated with the term\n(l)\n\n(l)\n\n2(l)\n\nF1n (b, \u03bc2 , \u03c12 , \u03c9) = F1n = cot(k2n bl ) ,\n\n(89)\n\nand the substructure (i.e., soft layer plus hard half space below the ground), associated with the\nterm\n(l)\n\n(l)\n\nF2n (h, \u03bc0 , \u03c10 , \u03bc1 , \u03c11 , \u03bc2 , \u03c12 , w, \u03c9) = F2n =\n2(l)\n\ni\u03bc2 k2n wl\n2\u03c0\u03bc0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\uf8ee\n\nIn(l)+ (k1 , \u03c9)In(l)\u2212 (k1 , \u03c9) \uf8f0\n\n\u03bc0 k 0\n\ncos(k21 h) \u2212 i \u03bc1 k21 sin(k21 h)\n2\n\ncos(k21 h) \u2212\n\n\u03bc1 k 1\ni \u03bc0 k20\n2\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fb dk1\n0\nsin(k1 h) k2\n2\n\n(90)\n\nEach of these two substructures possesses its own natural modes, i.e., arising from F1n (b, \u03bc2 , \u03c12 , \u03c9) =\n0 for the superstructure, and F2n (h, \u03bc0 , \u03c10 , \u03bc1 , \u03c11 , \u03bc2 , \u03c12 , w, \u03c9) = 0 for the substructure, but the\nnatural modes of the complete structure (superstructure plus substructure) are neither the modes of\nthe superstructure nor those of the substructure since they are defined by\n(l)\n\n(l)\n\nF1n (b, \u03bc2 , \u03c12 , \u03c9) \u2212 F2n (h, \u03bc0 , \u03c10 , \u03bc1 , \u03c11 , \u03bc2 , \u03c12 , w, \u03c9) = 0 ,\n\n(91)\n\nwhich emphasizes the fact that the natural modes of the complete structure result from the interaction of the natural modes of the superstructure with those of the substructure. Note that the\nsolutions of (91) can be quite different from those of either/both F1n = 0 and F2n = 0.\nIn order to establish the natural frequencies of the complete structure, we first analyze the natural frequencies of each substructure and assume that all media in the structure are non-dissipative\n(i.e., elastic).\nThe solutions of the dispersion relation for the superstructure are:\ns\u0012\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u0013\n\u0010\n\u0011\nn\u03c0\n(2m + 1) \u03c0 2\n2(l)\n2(l)\nl\n2\n+\ncot k2n bl = 0 \u21d4 k2n bl = (2m + 1) \u03c0 \u21d4 \u03c9 = \u03c9nm = c\nbl\nwl\n; m, n = 0, 1, 2, ... , (92)\n\nwhich are the natural frequencies of vibration of a block with a displacement-free base (i.e., at these\nnatural frequencies, u2(l) x2 =0 vanishes on the base segment of the block). This relation shows that\nthere corresponds to the n-th block mode an infinite set of sub-modes, identified by the index m.\nThe same can be said about the natural modes of the entire configuration.\nNow consider the dispersion relation for the substructure of the entire structure.

Quasi displacement-free base block modes are different from displacement-free base block\nmodes which, at present, means that the (n, \u03c9) couples for which F1n (b, \u03bc2 , \u03c12 , \u03c9) = 0 are not\nidentical to the (n, \u03c9) couples for which F2n (h, \u03bc0 , \u03c10 , \u03bc1 , \u03c11 , \u03bc2 , \u03c12 , w, \u03c9) = 0.\nRemark 2\nFor small \u03bc2 /\u03bc1 , the quasi displacement- free base block modes are a small perturbation of displacement- free base block modes, which means here that the (n, \u03c9) couples for which F1n (b, \u03bc2 , \u03c12 , \u03c9) =\n0 are close to the (n, \u03c9) couples for which F2n (h, \u03bc0 , \u03c10 , \u03bc1 ,\u03c11 , \u03bc2 , \u03c12 , w, \u03c9) = 0. This is a relativelylogical result in that when \u03bc2 /\u03bc1 is small, the waves coming from the infrastructure have more\ntrouble penetrating into the blocks and modifying therein the modal structure.\nRemark 3\nThe dispersion relation for quasi displacement- free base block modes is independent of the number\nof blocks (provided this number is greater than 0).

Thus, there is no apparent gain in adopting the analysis of\nthe present section over that of the previous section in an attempt to resolve the difficulty mentioned\nin Remark 3 in the previous section, namely the fact that the dispersion relations do not depend\non the number N of blocks in the city.\nTo resolve this problem, we must take into account the off-diagonal elements of the matrix because these elements contain the information on the number of blocks. Unfortunately, the inclusion\nof these off-diagonal elements makes the dispersion relation increasingly complicated and difficult to\nanalyze as the order of approximation of the partition method (which consists in solving increases\n(it is already quite complicated at first order). The only way to solve these dispersion relations\n(which consist in equating determinants of increasing rank to zero) is by numerical computation.\nWhen more than one block (for example 2 blocks) are present, the dispersion relations becomes\n(if the off-diagonal elements of the matrix for each block considered independently can be neglected):\n!\n(11)\n(12)\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2212Q00\n1 \u2212 Q00\n(11)\n(22)\n(12) (21)\ndet\n= 1 \u2212 Q00\n1 \u2212 Q00 \u2212 Q00 Q00 = 0\n(125)\n(21)\n(22)\n\u2212Q00\n1 \u2212 Q00\nwhich is quite different from the zeroth-order quasi displacement-free base block dispersion relation\n(12) (21)\nbecause the coupling term Q00 Q00 does not vanish and cannot be neglected. This term corresponds to the so-called structure-soil-structure interaction and accounts for the distance separating\nthe two buildings. Its form is close to that of the term representative of the action of the geophysical\n29\n\n\fstructure. Nevertheless, due to its complexity, it is difficult to carry out an analytical study of this\nrelation.\nThe partition method emphasizes the role of the global superstructure, while the iteration\nmethod, described in sect. 6.4, emphasizes the role of only one component (i.e. one block) of\nthe superstructure. The partition method also accounts for all the possible interactions between\n(ll)\nblocks (the term cot (k20 bl )) and the geophysical structure through the terms Qnm , and the inter(lj)\n(jl)\naction between blocks through the terms Qnm and Qnm .\nUltimately, the choice of method reduces to determining which one gives the best results, i.e.,\nresults that are closest to reality. This can be determined only by full-blown numerical studies, the\nresults of which will have to be compared to those of the FE method (employed as a reference). In\nfact, we find that the partition method gives the best results, and is therefore employed in all the\nsubsequent numerical computations.\n\nExpression of the fields u2(j) (x, \u03c9), u1(x, \u03c9) and u0 (x, \u03c9) for line\nsource excitation\n\n7\n\n2(l)\n\nOnce the quasi-modal coefficients Bm , \u2200m \u2208 N, \u2200l \u2208 B are obtained from the matrix equation\n(115), the field in the block domain \u03a92(l) is computed via (44).

These sources are located at the top of the layer and\nshould excite quasi-Love waves, as shown in [21, 22, 20] (for applied sources).\nIf higher-order quasi modes are relevant, the even-order modes corresponds to ribbon sources\nof width wl , located at dl , l \u2208 B, while the odd-order modes correspond to line sources located at\nthe edges of the blocks. The amplitudes of both of these types of induced sources depend on the\norder of the quasi modes and on the characteristics of the corresponding block.\n\n8\n\nNumerical results for one block in a Mexico City-like site\n\nAll intervals over the which integration is performed in the calculation of the quasi-modal\n(jl)\n(l)\nQnm , (n, m) \u2208 N2 ,\ncoefficients, through the linear system (115), i.e. in the calculation of Pn and\nX of1(l)\n(j, l) \u2208 B2 , and in the calculation of the displacement fields u1 = u1c +\nuB and u0 = ui +\nu0d\nc\n\n+\n\nX\nl\u2208B\n\n0(l)\nuB ,\n\nare first reduced to\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\n0\n\nl\u2208B\n\n\u0001\n.

An eigenfrequency is a frequency for which F = F1 \u2212 F2 = 0, i.e.,\nfor which R (F1 ) = R (F2 ) at the least. One notes that this occurs for \u03bd \u2248 0.3, 0.63, 1.35, 1.92 Hz\nin the frequency range of the figure.

On the contrary, the quasi stress-free\nbase block (close to stress-free base block modes, corresponding to u22 x2 =0 = 0 and satisfying\n\u0001\nQSF B\ntan k2 b = 0) at \u03bd01\n\u2248 1.35Hz is a mode with very large attenuation. This third type of mode\n(quasi stress-free base block modes) should therefore have a small influence on the response at the\nsite, as was mentioned in section 6.3.\nTo give an indication on how the block is excited, and how it re-radiates the field, we depict\nin figure 7 the absolute values of the zeroth-order terms, i.e. (1 \u2212 Q00 ) and P0 , involved in the\nresolution of the linear system (115). The integration interval is divided into three subintervals:\nIk , k = 1, 2, 3. The source term 2\u03c0k cos(k2 b)P0 (\u03c9)/S(\u03c9)k is similar to the transfer function in the\n\u0001\n(j)\u2212\nabsence of the block in [22]. The term I0 (k1 , \u03c9) = sinc k1 w2 exerts a small influence on P0 (\u03c9).\nThe solicitation of the block takes a form close to waves traveling in the layer in the absence of the\nblock. The deep source being located close to a line going straight down from the block, the main\ncomponent of P0 (\u03c9) comes from the integration over I1 (i.e. interference of propagative waves\nin the substructure), while the main component of Q00 (\u03c9), which is independent of the source\nlocation, comes from the integration over I2 (i.e. Love mode excitation).\n8.1.1\n\nDisplacement field on the top and bottom segments of the block for deep line\nsource solicitation\n\nWe now examine the displacement field on the horizontal boundaries of the block.\nFigure 8, depicts the spectrum and time history of the total displacement at the center of the\nsummit segment of the block as computed by the mode-matching method (with account taken of\none quasi-mode) and the finite-element method for a deep source. No noticeable differences are\nfound between the results of the two methods of computation. The neglect of the quasi-modes of\norder larger than 0 is valid for this block width. The block acts as a ribbon source of width w\nlocated at the base segment.\nFigure 9 depicts the spectrum and the time history of the total displacement on the ground in\nthe absence of the block as well as the total displacement at the centers of the top and base segments\nof the block for a deep source.

In the frequency domain, there is an\nincrease of the maximum amplitude and the sharpness of the first resonance peak of the substructure\nat around 0.3Hz, as noticed previously, to some extent, in [32, 10], and is a characteristic feature\nof the so-called soil-structure interaction. A similar phenomenon was mentioned in 6.3, and is due\nto the ability of shallow sources to excite Love modes in the configuration without blocks [21].\nHere, a quasi-Love mode can be excited due to the presence of the block, which acts like a shallow\n(actually located on the ground) source. A similar fact was already noticed in [22], where the spectra\nof the displacement on the ground for a deep source (provoking only interference phenomena) was\ncompared to that for a shallow source (provoking Love mode excitation).\nThe so-called soil-structure interaction consists (in the configuration with blocks) in a modification of the phenomenon from a state where interference (when a soft layer is present) or reflection\n(when the soft layer is absent) phenomena are dominant to a state where a quasi-Love mode is\nexcited. This mode is excited because of the presence of the block in a configuration. In the absence\nof the latter, no mode can be excited.\nAnother point of view is that the block takes the form of an induced source at the top of the\nlayer (see section 7.1), and it is now known that Love modes are excited when such a configuration\nis solicited by a line source near the boundaries of the layer [20].\nA particular feature of the spectrum of the displacement when the block is present, (top-right\nc2\nDF B\nsubfigure of fig. 9) is that it vanishes at the base segment for \u03bd00\n\u2248 , which is the fundamental\n2b\ndisplacement-free base block eigenfrequency. This is made evident in the field representation in\nthe block and can be understood to be a geometrical effect which, in the case of a single block,\ncorresponds to the excitation of a quasi-mode.\n\n8.2\n\nResults relative to one 50m \u00d7 30m block\n\nThe block is 50m high and 30m wide. The displacement-free base block eigenfrequencies\nare then 0.5, 1.5Hz, ..... Figure 10 gives an indication of the modes of the configuration. One\nnotes that the eigenfrequencies (frequencies at which R(F1 ) = R(F2 ), at the least) are \u03bd \u2248\n0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 1.53, 1.75, 1.93. The attenuations of the quasi-Love mode at \u03bd \u2248 0.3 and 0.9 Hz,\nand of the quasi displacement-free base block at \u03bd \u2248 0.5 and 1.5Hz are relatively-small.\u0001 As\npreviously, the attenuation of the quasi stress-free base block (close to the zeros of tan k2 b ) at\nQSF B\n\u2248 1Hz is relatively-large.\n\u03bd0,1\nIn figs. 11 and 12, we plot the absolute values of the zeroth-order terms involved in the resolution\nof the linear system (115). The source terms 2\u03c0k cos(k2 b)P0 (\u03c9)/S(\u03c9)k are once again close to the\ntransfer functions calculated without the block for both locations of the source xs = (0m, 3000m)\nand xs = (\u22123000m, 100m).\n\u0001\n(j)\u2212\nThe term I0 (k1 , \u03c9) = sinc k1 w2 again has a small influence on P0 (\u03c9). For a deep source, the\nmain component of P0 (\u03c9) comes from the integration over I1 (i.e. the solicitation of the block takes\nthe form of interfering propagative waves traveling in the layer associated with bulk waves in the\nsubstratum) while for a shallow source, the main component of P0 (\u03c9) comes from the integration\nover I2 (i.e. the solicitation of the block takes the form of propagative waves traveling in the layer\nassociated with evanescent waves in the substratum, i.e., Love modes).

This means that in absence of the block, the displacement field is\nmainly composed of propagative waves in the substratum and interfering propagative waves in the\nlayer.\nFigure 13, depicts the spectra and time histories of the total displacement at the center of the top\nand bottom segments of the block, as computed by the mode-matching method (with account taken\nof one quasi-mode) and the finite-element method, for a deep source. No noticeable differences are\nfound between the results of the two methods of computation. The neglect of the quasi-modes of\norder larger than 0 is valid for this block width. The block acts as a ribbon source of width w\nlocated at the base segment.\nFigure 14 depicts the spectra and the time histories of the total displacement on the ground in\nthe absence of the block as well as the total displacement at the centers of the top and base segments\nof the block for a deep source.

Again, the displacement field vanishes at the base segment for a frequency close to\nDF .\n\u03bd00\n8.2.2\n\nDisplacement field on the top and bottom segments of the block for shallow\nline source solicitation\n\nWe now consider what happens when the seismic disturbance is delivered to the site by a shallow\nline source located at xs = (\u22123000m, 100m). This means that, in the absence of the block, the\ndisplacement field in the substructure is that of Love modes at the resonance frequencies of these\nmodes.\nFigure 15 compares the displacement on the ground in the absence of the block to that in\nthe block (on the top and bottom segments thereof) for a shallow source. In the time domain,\nthe durations are substantially the same when the block is present or absent, but the peak and\ncumulative amplitudes are larger in the presence of the block. In the frequency domain, both the\nsharpness and amplitude of the first peak, corresponding to the first Love mode in absence of the\nblocks, increase. This means that the soil-structure interaction obtained for a deep source is also\nfound for a shallow source. The fact that the position of this peak is hardly shifted means that\nthe structure of the quasi-Love mode is very nearly that of the Love mode existing in the absence\nof the block. However, the presence of the block enables this mode to be excited more efficiently\nthan in its absence, i.e., when the site is solicited solely by the shallow source and not by waves\nre-emitted by the block.\n8.2.3\n\nDisplacement on the ground on one side of the block for deep line source\nsolicitation\n\nTo obtain a more complete picture of the modification of the phenomena due to the presence\nof a block, we now focus our attention on the ground motion outside of the block.\nThe deep seismic line source is located at xs = (0m, 3000m). Figures 16 represents 2\u03c0 times the\ntransfer function u1 (x, \u03c9)/S(\u03c9) at various locations on the ground outside of the block, computed\nby the mode-matching method by taking into account only the zeroth-order quasi-mode. From the\nfact that the deep source is close to the vertical line passing through these ground locations, in the\nabsence of the block, the first peak of the transfer function is principally due to the integral over\nI1 [21, 22]. The presence of the block induces: i) a double dependency of the first peak on the\nintegrals over I1 and over I2 which leads to splitting of the first peak at some locations (as seen in\nthe results at xg = (150m, 0m)), ii) surface waves in the layer (represented by the contribution of\nthe integration over I3 ) which normally are not excited in the case of a deep source, [21, 22]. The\npresence of the block allows the excitation of a quasi-Love mode as is testified by the importance\nof the integration over I2 .\nFig. 17 shows once again that there is a good agreement between the results of the modematching method (with only the fundamental quasi-mode taken into account) and the finite element\nmethod.\n40\n\n\f1000\n\n1000\n2\n\n800\n\n2\u03c0||u (x,\u03bd)||, j=1,2 (mm)\n\n2\u03c0||uj(x,\u03bd)||, j=1,2 (mm)\n\n2\n\n2\u03c0||u (x,\u03bd)||\n2\u03c0||u1(x,\u03bd)||\n\n600\n\n600\n400\n\nj\n\n400\n\n800\n\n2\u03c0||u (x,\u03bd)||\n2\u03c0||u1(x,\u03bd)||\n\n200\n0\n0\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\n\u03bd (Hz)\n\n200\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\nuj(x,t), j=1,2 (mm)\n\nuj(x,t), j=1,2 (mm)\n\n2\n\n80\nu2(x,t)\nu1(x,t)\n\n60\n\n20\n0\n\n\u221220\n\nu2(x,t)\nu1(x,t)\n\n40\n20\n0\n\n\u221220\n\n\u221240\n\n\u221240\n\n\u221260\n\u221280\n0\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\n\u03bd (Hz)\n\n\u221260\n50\n\n100\nt (s)\n\n150\n\n200\n\n\u221280\n0\n\n20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200\nt (s)\n\nFigure 15: Comparison of 2\u03c0 times the spectrum (on the top), and time history (on the bottom)\nof the total displacement on the ground in the absence of the block (solid curves) with the total\ndisplacement, (dotted curves) at the center of the top segment (left panel) and of the bottom\nsegment (right panel) of a single 50m \u00d7 30m block, for a shallow line source located at xs =\n(\u22123000m, 100m).\n\n41\n\n\f16\n\n14\n\n14\n\n12\n10\n\n10\n\n2\u03c0||TF1(x,\u03bd)||\n\n1\n\n2\u03c0||TF (x,\u03bd)||\n\n12\n\n8\n6\n\n6\n4\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n0\n0\n\n8\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n\u03bd (Hz)\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n8\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\n1\n\u03bd (Hz)\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\n\u03bd (Hz)\n\n12\n\n7\n10\n\n8\n\n5\n\n2\u03c0||TF1(x,\u03bd)||\n\n2\u03c0||TF(x,\u03bd)||\n\n6\n\n4\n3\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n2\n\n1\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n1.2\n\u03bd (Hz)\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\n0\n0\n\nFigure 16: 2\u03c0 times the transfer function (solid curves) of the total displacement on the ground\nat x = (20m, 0m) (top-left), x = (30m, 0m) (top-right), x = (150m, 0m) (bottom-left), and x =\n(300m, 0m) (bottom-right).

The duration and\ncumulative amplitude of the displacement fields have a tendency of increasing as one approaches\nthe block, but not in monotonic manner, as manifested by what happens at 150m.\nThis may be one of the causes of the spatial variability of the destructions noticed during\nthe Michoacan earthquake. As shown by the form of the matrix in section 6.5, one can expect\none building to have an effect on its neigbors via the waves traveling in the substructure and in\nparticular in the layer and along the ground. Thus, the effect of one block on the other can vary in\na way that depends on the distance of their separation. Nethertheless, the authors of [19] did not\nfind substantial differences in response for varying building separations in the case of an idealized\ncity composed of ten blocks.

However, this double dependence of the first peak finds no apparent translation in the\ntime history of the displacement on the ground, as seen in fig. 20. In fact, we see in this figure\nthat there are no substantial differences in the responses on the ground between the cases of the\nabsence and presence of the block.\n8.2.5\n\nDisplacement in the substratum\n\nThe focus here is on the displacement field in the subtratum when the solicitation is due to a\ndeep source located at xs = (0, 3000m).\nAs shown in fig. 21, the main components of the diffracted field (i.e. u0 \u2212 ui ) are those due to\npropagative and evanescent waves in the substratum, the latter being associated with a quasi-Love\nmode.\nThe comparison of the results of the mode-matching and finite element methods is made in\nfig. 22. The time history of the total displacement field is mainly composed of the incident and\nspecularly-reflected fields. Although a quasi-Love mode is excited, it hardly makes itself felt in the\nsubstratum.\n\n46\n\n\f250\n200\n\nwith one 50m\u00d730m block\nwithout blocks\n25\nu1(x,t) (mm)\n\n2\u03c0||u1(x,\u03bd)|| (mm)\n\n50\n\nwith one 50m\u00d730m block\nwithout blocks\n\n150\n100\n\n\u221225\n\n50\n0\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\n\u03bd (Hz)\n\n\u221250\n0\n\n2\n\n250\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80 100 120 140 160 180\nt (s)\n\n50\n\nwith one 50m\u00d730m block\nwithout blocks\n\nwith one 50m\u00d730m block\nwithout blocks\n\n200\n\nu1(x,t) (mm)\n\n1\n\n2\u03c0||u (x,\u03bd)||\n\n25\n150\n\n100\n\n0\n\n\u221225\n50\n\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n1.2\n\u03bd (Hz)\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\n\u221250\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80 100 120 140 160 180\nt (s)\n\nFigure 20: Comparison of 2\u03c0 times the spectrum (left panel) and of the time history (right panel) of\nthe total displacement on the ground in the absence of the block (solid curves) and in the presence\nof the block (dashed curves) at various locations on the ground: (from the top to the bottom)\nat 150 and 300m from the center of a single 50m \u00d7 30m block.

The latter go by the name of structure-soil-structure\ninteraction.\nThe two blocks, situated in a Mexico City-like environment, are located such that the center of\nthe base segment of block 1 is (0m,0m) and that of block 2 is (-65m,0m).\nThe parameters of the site are: \u03c10 = 2000 kg/m3 , c0 =600 m/s, Q0 = \u221e, \u03c11 = 1300 kg/m3 ,\nc1 =60 m/s, Q1 = 30, with the soft layer thickness being h = 50 m. The material constants of the\nblocks are: \u03c12 = 325 kg/m3 , c2 =100 m/s, Q2 = 100.\nThe incident cylindrical wave is radiated by a deep line source located at (0m, 3000m).\n2\nF B = c (2m+1) , and\nRecall that the eigenfrequencies of the displacement-free base block are \u03bd0m\n2b\nHASK = 2m+1 c1 , wherein m = 0, 1, 2, ....

An\neigenfrequency is a frequency for which R (F) = 0. The attenuation associated with a particular\nmode (at a frequency \u03bd \u22c6 ) is given by I (F(\u03bd \u22c6 )).\nA quasi-Love mode is excited at \u03bd \u2248 0.3. We could expect two different quasi displacementQDF\nfree base block modes for a system with two non-identical blocks (at \u03bd00\n\u2248 0.5 and 0.625Hz),\nbut only one eigenfrequency, at \u2248 0.7Hz, is found (actually this value is debatable, since the\nthe eigenfrequency might actually correspond to a minimum of kFk rather than to a zero of F).\nThis means that: i) the modes of a complex configuration are not the union of the modes of the\nsubsystems of which it is composed, ii) the single quasi displacement-free block mode results from\nthe inter block coupling of the fields, i.e., the (structure-soil-structure interaction), iii) this mode\nis a coupled mode and is associated with a smaller attenuation than either of the corresponding\nmodes of the two associated one-block configurations, iv) the correct expression of the modes of\nthe system is the one given in section 6.5 involving the couplings between the blocks. In particular,\n(ij)\nthe coupling matrix Q00 , i 6= j cannot be neglected.\n49\n\n\f1\n0.8\nR(F(\u03bd)) ; I(F(\u03bd))\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.4\n\u22120.6\n\u22120.8\n\u22121\n0\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\n\u03bd (Hz)\n\n2\n\nFigure 23: Indications concerning the dispersion relation for a system of two blocks, one with\ndimensions 50m \u00d7 30m and the other with dimensions 40m \u00d7 40m. The solid curve represents\nR(F) and the dashed curve |I(F)|.\nTo distinguish this mode from the quasi displacement-free base block mode for a single block\nthat accounts only for the structure-soil interaction, we call it the multi-displacement-free base block\nmode.\n9.1.1\n\nResponse on the top and bottom segments of the blocks\n\nNow consider the response at the centers of the top segments of the two blocks. The responses\nat these locations, as computed by the finite element and mode matching methods (with account\ntaken only of the zeroth-order quasi-mode in each building), are seen in fig. 24 to be almost identical\nM DF \u2248 0.6Hz, translates the excitation of the multi-displacement-free\nin each block. The peak at \u03bd00\nQDF\nbase block mode. This peak is sharper than the one encountered for only one block at \u03bd00\n(due\nto excitation of the quasi displacement-free base block mode), which fact is essentially due to its\nlarger amplitude. The important sharpness of this peak is also related to the fact that the excited\nmode is a coupled mode. This suggests that the larger the number of blocks, the larger will be the\nresponse at the resonance frequency of the multi-displacement-free base block mode.\nWe compare in fig. 25 the results obtained in (at the centers of the top and bottom segments of)\nthe two blocks with those on the ground (at the same locations as the centers of bottom segments of\nthe blocks) in the absence of these blocks. In the time domain, a small increase of the duration and\na more substantial increase of the peak and cumulative amplitudes can be observed, in particular on\nthe top segments of the two blocks. These increases are more important than in the configurations\nwith a single 40m \u00d7 40m or 50m \u00d7 30m block (see figs. 9 and 14), and is also somewhat more\nimportant in block 1 than in block 2, as already noticed in the cases of single blocks. The field\nvanishes at the center of the bottom segments at the displacement-free base frequencies: \u03bd = 0.5Hz\nfor block 1 and \u03bd = 0.625Hz for block 2. This emphasizes the fact that the multi displacement-free\nblock mode is different from the quasi displacement-free block mode of the configuration with only\none block, and is a manifestation of geometrical features.\n50\n\n\f350\n\n100\n\n250\n\nu2(2)(x,t) (mm)\n\n2\u03c0||u2(2)(x,\u03bd)|| (mm)\n\n300\n\n200\n150\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\n\u221250\n\n50\n0\n0\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\n\u03bd (Hz)\n\n\u2212100\n0\n\n2\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\nt (s)\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\nt (s)\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n100\n\n50\nu2(1)(x,t) (mm)\n\n2\u03c0||u2(1)(x,\u03bd)|| (mm)\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n\u221250\n\n100\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\n\u03bd (Hz)\n\n2\n\n\u2212100\n0\n\nFigure 24: 2\u03c0 times the spectrum (left panels) and time histories (right panels) of the total displacement of a configuration with two blocks for a deep seismic line source located at xs = (0, 3000m).\nThe top panels apply to the field at the center of the top segment of block 2 (40 \u00d7 40 block).\nThe lower panels apply to the field at the center of the top segment of block 1 (50 \u00d7 30 block).\nThe dashed curves result from a computation via the semi-analytical (quasi-mode) method (taking\naccount only of the zeroth-order quasi-mode in each block), whereas the solid curves result from a\nfinite element computation.\n\n51\n\n\f100\n\n2\u03c0||u2(1)(x,\u03bd)||\n1\n2\u03c0||u (x,\u03bd)||\n\nuj(x,t), j=1, 2(1) (mm)\n\n2\u03c0||uj(x,\u03bd)||, j=1, 2(1) (mm)\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n0\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\n\u03bd (Hz)\n\nu2(1)(x,t)\nu1(x,t)\n50\n\n0\n\n\u221250\n\n\u2212100\n0\n\n2\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n0\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\n\u03bd (Hz)\n\nuj(x,t), j=1, 2(1) (mm)\n\n2\u03c0||uj(x,\u03bd)||, j=1, 2(1) (mm)\n\n100\n\n120\n\n50\n\n0\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\n\u03bd (Hz)\n\n40\n\n60\nt (s)\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nu2(1)(x,t)\nu1(x,t)\n50\n\n0\n\n\u221250\n\n\u2212100\n0\n\n2\n\n400\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\nt (s)\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n100\n\n2(2)\n\nuj(x,t), j=1, 2(2) (mm)\n\n2\u03c0||u (x,\u03bd)||\n2\u03c0||u1(x,\u03bd)||\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\n\u03bd (Hz)\n\n20\n\n100\n\n2(1)\n\n2\u03c0||uj(x,\u03bd)||j=1, 2(2) (mm)\n\n80\n\nu2(2)(x,t)\nu1(x,t)\n\n\u2212100\n0\n\n2\n\n2\u03c0||u (x,\u03bd)||\n1\n2\u03c0||u (x,\u03bd)||\n\n0\n0\n\n60\nt (s)\n\n\u221250\n\n400\n\n0\n0\n\n40\n\n100\n\n2\u03c0||u2(2)(x,\u03bd)||\n1\n2\u03c0||u (x,\u03bd)||\nuj(x,t), j=1, 2(2) (mm)\n\n2\u03c0||uj(x,\u03bd)||, j=1, 2(2) (mm)\n\n400\n\n20\n\n2\n\nu2(2)(x,t)\nu1(x,t)\n50\n\n0\n\n\u221250\n\n\u2212100\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\nt (s)\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nFigure 25: Comparison of 2\u03c0 times the spectrum (left panels) and time history (right panels) of the\ntotal displacement on the ground in absence of blocks (solid curves) and in the presence of blocks\n(dashed curves).

The eigenfreqencies\ncorresponding to RF = 0, are seen to occur at 0.3, 0.35, 0.6, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0Hz... Some of them\nare close to each other and can be gathered together into the groups: 0.3 \u2212 0.35, 0.6 \u2212 0.7 and\n0.9 \u2212 1.0 Hz. This suggests a splitting associated with the lifting of the degeneracy of eigenvalues.\nNevertheless, the attenuations of the modes at 0.35, 0.7 and 0.9 \u2212 1.0 are very large, so that we can\nexpect them to be hardly excited (as will be confirmed in the following results).\n9.2.1\n\nResponse on the top and bottom segments of the blocks\n\nIn fig. 27 we see that the results obtained by the two computational methods pertaining to the\nresponse at the center of the summit segments of the two 40m \u00d7 40m blocks are nearly identical.\nThe amplitude of the multi-displacement-free base block resonance peak is higher for two identical\nblocks, than it was for two different blocks. As pointed out during the previous discussion of the\ndispersion relation of the configuration, no splitting of the first and second peaks is noticed because\nof the high attenuation of one of each pair of split modes. On the contrary, the large response due\nto the excitation of the other one of the pairs of split modes is due to the small attenuation of these\nmodes. Notice also that the second (quasi displacement-free base mode) peaks in the spectra of the\nfigure are larger than the first peaks, in contrast to what was obtained for two dissimilar blocks.\nIn fig. 28 we compare the displacement in the two blocks (in particular, at the centers of the\nsummit and base segments) with the displacement on the ground in the absence of these blocks.\nThe response of the two blocks are, in fact, identical, due to the deep source being located on the\nvertical dividing line between the two blocks. One observes an increase of the duration and of the\npeak and cumulative amplitudes that is larger than for two different blocks, in particular, on the\n\n53\n\n\f700\n\n100\n\n50\n\n500\n\nu2(2)(x,t) (mm)\n\n2\u03c0||u2(2)(x,\u03bd)|| (mm)\n\n600\n\n400\n300\n200\n\n0\n\n\u221250\n\n100\n0\n0\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\n\u03bd (Hz)\n\n\u2212100\n0\n\n2\n\n700\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\nt (s)\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\nt (s)\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n100\n\n50\n\n500\n\nu2(1)(x,t) (mm)\n\n2\u03c0||u2(1)(x,\u03bd)|| (mm)\n\n600\n\n400\n300\n200\n\n0\n\n\u221250\n\n100\n0\n0\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\n\n1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\n\u03bd (Hz)\n\n2\n\n\u2212100\n0\n\nFigure 27: 2\u03c0 times the spectra (left panel) and time histories (right panel) of the total displacement\nat the center of the summit segment of block 2 (top panels), and at the center of the summit segment\nof block 1 (bottom panels), as computed by the mode-matching method (accounting only for the\nzeroth-order quasi-mode) (dashed curves) and by the finite element method (solid curves) for a\nconfiguration with two 40m \u00d7 40m blocks solicited by the cylindrical wave radiated by a deep line\nsource.\n\n54\n\n\ftop segments. This increase seems to be due to the much more stronger response associated with\nthe excitation of the multi displacement-free base mode block. This hypothesis is backed up by the\nfact that the said mode is more weakly excited on the base segment and at the same time the time\nhistory is much closer to that of the configuration with no blocks. Finally, the displacement at the\ncenter of the base segments vanishes at the frequency of occurrence of the displacement-free base\nmode of the block (which is not a mode of the global configuration) and is slightly different from\nthe corresponding multi-displacement-free block mode eigenfrequency.\n\n9.3\n\nResults relative to a two-block configuration with two 50m \u00d7 30m blocks\n\nThe blocks are 50m high and 30m wide and their center-to-center separation is 65m.\nThe displacement-free base block eigenfrequencies are 0.5, 1.5Hz, ..... Fig. 29 gives an indication\nof the solution of the dispersion relation. Eigenfreqencies (i.e., solutions of RF = 0) are found at\n0.3, 0.55, 1.0, 1.4... The attenuations associated with the quasi-Love mode at 0.3Hz and the multi\ndisplacement-free base block mode at 0.55Hz are rather small. The eigenfrequencies are not close\nto each other, contrary to the case of two identical 40m \u00d7 40m blocks.\n9.3.1\n\nResponse on the top and bottom segments of the blocks\n\nThe response at the centers of the summit segments of both blocks computed by the finite\nelement method is compared in fig. 30 to the corresponding response computed by the mode\nmatching method (with account taken only of the zeroth-order quasi-mode. Once again, we observe\nthese responses to be almost identical. Moreover, the amplitude of the multi- displacement-free\nbase block resonance peak is observed (in the same figure) to be higher for two identical blocks,\nthan it was for two different blocks.\nIn fig. 31 we compare the displacements in the two blocks (i.e., at the centers of the summit and\nbase segments) with the displacement on the ground (at the same points as occupied by the centers\nof the base segments of the blocks) in the absence of the blocks. The response of the two blocks\nare identical for the previously-mentioned reasons. A much larger increase of the duration and of\nthe peak and cumulative amplitudes (particularly on the top segments) is obtained for the two\nidentical blocks than for two different blocks. This increase seems to be due to the much stronger\nresponse at the frequency corresponding to the excitation of the multi displacement-free base block\nmode. Once again, the displacement at the center of the base segments vanishes at a frequency\ncorresponding to the occurrence of the displacement-free base mode of the block.\n9.3.2\n\nResponse on the ground\n\nIn order to get another grip on the phenomena that are produced when two blocks are present,\nwe now focus on the displacement field at points on the ground outside of the blocks.\n\n55\n\n\f600\n\n100\n\n2\u03c0||u2(1)(x,\u03bd)||\n1\n2\u03c0||u (x,\u03bd)||\nuj(x,t), j=1, 2(1) (mm)\n\n2\u03c0||uj(x,\u03bd)||, j=1,2(1) (mm)\n\n700\n\n500\n400\n300\n200\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\n\u03bd (Hz)\n\n2\n\n\u2212100\n0\n\n600\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\nt (s)\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n100\n\n2\u03c0||u2(2)(x,\u03bd)||\n1\n2\u03c0||u (x,\u03bd)||\n\nuj(x,t), j=1, 2(2) (mm)\n\n2\u03c0||uj(x,\u03bd)||, j=1, 2(2) (mm)\n\n0\n\n\u221250\n\n700\n\n500\n400\n300\n200\n\nu2(2)(x,t)\nu1(x,t)\n50\n\n0\n\n\u221250\n\n100\n0\n0\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\n\u03bd (Hz)\n\n2\n\n\u2212100\n0\n\n250\n2\u03c0||u (x,\u03bd)||\n2\u03c0||u1(x,\u03bd)||\n\nuj(x,t), j=1, 2(1) (mm)\n\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n0\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\n\u03bd (Hz)\n\n2\n\n60\nt (s)\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n50\n\n0\n\n\u221250\n\n\u2212100\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\nt (s)\n\n80\n\n100\nuj(x,t), j=1, 2(2) (mm)\n\n2\u03c0||u2(2)(x,\u03bd)||\n1\n2\u03c0||u (x,\u03bd)||\n\n150\n100\n\n100\n\n120\n\nu2(2)(x,t)\nu1(x,t)\n\n50\n\n0\n\n\u221250\n\n50\n0\n0\n\n40\n\nu2(1)(x,t)\nu1(x,t)\n\n250\n200\n\n20\n\n100\n\n2(1)\n\n2\u03c0||uj(x,\u03bd)||, j=1, 2(1) (mm)\n\n50\n\n100\n0\n0\n\n2\u03c0||uj(x,\u03bd)||, j=1, 2(2) (mm)\n\nu2(1)(x,t)\nu1(x,t)\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\n\u03bd (Hz)\n\n2\n\n\u2212100\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\nt (s)\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nFigure 28: Comparison of 2\u03c0 times the spectrum (left panels) and of the time history (right panels)\nof the total displacement on the ground in the absence of blocks (solid curves) and in the presence\nof the blocks (dashed curves).

In particular, the blocks modify the dispersion relation of what,\nin the absence of the blocks, constitutes the Love modes.\nThree different and complementary points of view were developed (in the framework of the mode\nmatching theory) concerning the dispersion relation relative to the configuration with blocks. The\nfirst emphasizes the role of the substructure (i.e. the geophysical (flat ground/layer/substratum)\nstructure ). The second emphasizes the role of each particular block of the superstructure. The\nthird point of view emphasizes the couplings of the fields in the superstructure with those in the\nsubstructure.\nThe first two points of views enable the definition of two new types of modes relative to the\nconfiguration with blocks: the quasi-Love modes, which are small perturbations of the Love mode\n(which can exist when no blocks are present), and the quasi displacement- free base block modes,\nwhich are small perturbations of the displacement- free base block mode (which can exist when no\ngeophysical structure is present).\n62\n\n\fThese two types of quasi-modes account for coupling between a particular block of the superstructure with the substructure, but not for the couplings between blocks (when more than one\nblock is present). Thus, the so-called soil-structure interaction is shown to be due to the excitation\nof quasi Love modes.\nThe third point of view emphasizes the coupling between blocks (when more than one block\nis present). It was shown that this coupling, manifested by the existence of coupling matrices in\nthe expressions for the quasi mode amplitudes, is of the same form as the coupling between one\nparticular block and the substructure, which underlines the fact that the coupling between blocks\nis carried out via the substructure.\nThe study of the dispersion relation for the multi-block configurations is very complex, but\ncan be carried numerically. This was done for a two-block configuration and showed that a multi\ndisplacement-free base block mode can be produced. The latter was shown to correspond to a\ncoupled mode, constituted by a combination of quasi displacement-free base block modes of each\nblock, which are no longer excited as such in a configuration with more than one block. The multi\ndisplacement-free base block mode was shown to account for the so-called structure-soil-structure\ninteraction.\nIt was underlined that the modes of a complete one- or multi-block configuration do not constitute the reunion of the modes of the individual component structures. Thus, the phenomena for\na complete N block configuration are not the sum of the phenomena for N \u2212 1, N \u2212 2, .., 0 block\nconfigurations.\nThe excitation of these modes was then studied in the particular case of one and two blocks.\nA common feature of the influence of one/or more blocks is the excitation of the quasi-Love mode,\nwhich occurs even for solicitation by the waves radiated by a deep source (recall that, for this type\nof solicitation, it is not possible to excite ordinary Love modes in a flat ground (i.e., no blocks)/soft\nhorizontal layer/hard substratum configuration [21]). The trace of quasi-Love mode excitation in\nthe frequency domain was shown to be: i) for a deep source, a shift to lower frequency and an\nincrease of the amplitude of the first (lowest-frequency) peak of the response, and ii) for a shallow\nsource (the case in which waves whose structure is close to that of Love waves already exist in the\nlayer and substratum in the absence of the block(s)), an increase of the amplitude, and little or no\nshift, of the first resonance peak.\nAs concerns deep sources, the change of the phenomena, from a configuration without blocks\n(for which there exist only bulk waves in the geophysical structure), to one with blocks (for which\nthere exist quasi-Love modes characterized by a field in the substratum that is predominantly a\nsurface wave in the substratum) is a manifestation of the so-called soil-structure interaction.\nQuasi displacement-free base block modes are encountered only for configurations with one\nblock whereas multi displacement-free base block modes are excited in configurations with two\n(and presumably, more) blocks. Both of these modes are excited with incident waves that are\nradiated either from deep or shallow sources. The multi displacement-free base block mode is\nmore energetic and corresponds to a coupled mode. Its excitation is tied up with the so-called\nstructure-soil-structure interaction.\nThe modifications of frequency-domain response (and less so for the time-domain response)\nwere found to be fairly substantial, even when only one block is present, at large distances from\nthe block on the ground.\nGenerally speaking, the peak and cumulative amplitudes and duration of the time histories are\nlarger for a one- and two-block configuration than for flat ground, especially at locations within\n63\n\n\fthe block, but no spectacular effects, such as those noticed during the Michoacan earthquake were\nfound in the numerical simulations, either for the one- or two-block \"cities\".\nA configuration involving a larger number of blocks is difficult to study theoretically in the\nframework of the mode-matching formulation, which is why configurations with an infinite number\nof blocks, each one of which is close to the average shape and composition of the blocks of typical\ncities, is investigated in the companion paper. It is also shown in this paper that, beyond of the\norder of ten identical blocks, the response of the laterally-finite city is very close to that of the\ncity with an infinite number of blocks. More importantly, it is found in the companion paper, that\nthe phenomena are quite different, for configurations with a large number of identical blocks, from\nthose for a small number of identical or non-identical blocks, and that the said phenomena for a\nlarge number of blocks are evocative of those observed during earthquakes in urban areas such as\nMexico City.\nThis indicates that it is probably not sufficient to carry out experiments and numerical simulations on an isolated building [35, 23, 45] in order to predict correctly the seismic response of the\nbuilding when it is surrounded by other buildings (the situation of most buildings in a typical city).\n\nA\n\nAn auxiliary problem: fields in the layer and in the substratum\nwhen the seismic distrubance takes the form of a ribbon source\nof width w located in the layer\n\nThe problem is to determine the total fields u1 (x, \u03c9) and u0 (x, \u03c9), when the configuration\nwithout blocks (i.e. involving only a soft layer and a hard half space) is solicited by a horizontal\nribbon source of width w centered at xs in the soft layer.\n\nA.1\n\nBoundary conditions and field representations\n\nThe fields satisfy the continuity of displacement and traction conditions on \u0393h , i.e., (23) and\n(24), the vanishing traction condition on \u0393g (19), and the outgoing wave (radiation) condition.\nIn the layer and in the substratum the field representations are:\nZ \u221e\u0010\n\u0011\ndk1\n1\n1\n(139)\nA1 (k1 , \u03c9)e\u2212ik2 x2 + B 1 (k1 , \u03c9)eik2 x2 eik1 x1 1 ,\nu1 (x, \u03c9) = u1i (x, \u03c9) +\nk2\n\u2212\u221e\nand\n0\n\nu (x, \u03c9) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0\ndk1\nB 0 (k1 , \u03c9)ei(k1 x1 +k2 x2 ) 0 ,\nk2\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(140)\n\nrespectively.\n\nA.2\n\nThe (incident) field radiated by a ribbon source of width w\n\nBy employing the Green's theorem, the incident field can be written as:\nZ\ni1\nG(kx \u2212 yk, \u03c9)si1 (y, \u03c9)d\u031f(y); \u2200x, \u2208 R2 ,\nu (x, \u03c9) =\nR2\n\n64\n\n(141)\n\n\fwherein y is a vector from the origin O and pointing to a generic point in the sagittal plane (y1 , y2 ),\nG(kx \u2212 yk, \u03c9) the 2D free-space Green's function, and si1 (y, \u03c9) the source density function:\nsi1 (y, \u03c9) =\n\n\u0010\nS(\u03c9) h \u0010\nw\u0011\nw \u0011i\nH y1 \u2212 xs1 +\n\u2212 H y1 \u2212 xs1 \u2212\n\u03b4 (y2 \u2212 xs2 ) ,\nw\n2\n2\n\nwherein H( . ) is the Heaviside function and \u03b4( . ) the Dirac delta distribution.\nIntroducing (142) into (141), enables the incident field to be written as:\nZ \u221e\n\u0010 w \u0011 dk\ns\n1\ns\ni\n1\ni1\nS(\u03c9)ei(k1 (x1 \u2212x1 )+k1 |x2 \u2212x2 |) sinc k1\nu (x, \u03c9) =\n,\n1\n4\u03c0 \u221e\n2 k2\nwherein sinc(\u03b6) :=\n\nA.3\n\n(142)\n\n(143)\n\nsin \u03b6\n\u03b6 .\n\nExpression of the fields in the the presence of a ribbon source of width w\n\nThe introduction of the field representations (139) and (140) into the boundary conditions (with\nthe appropriate projection), leads, after the resolution of the resulting linear system, to:\n\u2022 for x2 \u2267 xs2 :\niS(\u03c9)\u03bc1\nu1 (x, \u03c9) =\n2\u03c0\u03bc0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03bc0 k 0\ncos k21 (xs2 \u2212 h) + i \u03bc1 k21 sin k21 (xs2 \u2212 h)\n2\n\u00d7\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03bc1 k21\n1\ncos k2 h \u2212 i \u03bc0 k0 sin k21 h\n2\n\n\u0010 w \u0011 dk\n\u0001\ns\n1\n, (144)\ncos k21 x2 eik1 (x1 \u2212x1 ) sinc k1\n2 k20\n\n\u2022 for x2 \u2266 xs2 :\niS(\u03c9)\u03bc1\nu1 (x, \u03c9) =\n2\u03c0\u03bc0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03bc0 k 0\ncos k21 (x2 \u2212 h) + i \u03bc1 k21 sin k21 (x2 \u2212 h)\n2\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03bc1 k21\n1\ncos k2 h \u2212 i \u03bc0 k0 sin k21 h\n2\n\n\u0010 w \u0011 dk\n\u0001\ns\n1\ncos k21 xs2 eik1 (x1 \u2212x1 ) sinc k1\n, (145)\n2 k20\n\nand\nu0 (x, \u03c9)\n\n=\n\niS(\u03c9)\u03bc1\n2\u03c0\u03bc0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\ns\n0\n\u0010 w\u0011\n\u0001\nei(k1 (x1 \u2212x1 )+k2 (x2 \u2212h))\n1 s dk1\ncos\nk\nx\nsinc\nk\n1\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1\n2\n2\n1\n\u03bc k\n2\nk20\ncos k21 h \u2212 i \u03bc0 k20 sin k21 h\n\n.
