Typical materials are TTF-TCNQ\nand (TMTSF)2 PF6 , where TTF, TCNQ, and TMTSF stand\nfor tetrathiafulvalene, tetracyanoquinodimethane, and tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene, respectively. In (TMTSF)2 PF6 ,\nthe first superconductivity behavior in molecular solids has\nbeen reported.1 Recent hot topics in the research of molecular crystals is the realization of charge ordering phenomena.2\nSince the pioneer work of Su et al.3 in polyacetylene, the\ncharge trapping phenomenon has been much studied in Peierls\ntransition issues.4 In that sense, quasi-one-dimensional chains\nhave received much attention from experimental and theoretical points of view.5\u20138 Theoretical approaches that focus on a\nsingle highest-occupied-molecular orbital (HOMO) or lowestunoccupied-molecular orbital (LUMO) have been successful\nin describing fascinating electronic ordered phase. Such a\ntreatment can be justified since in these conventional systems,\nthe HOMO or LUMO levels are well-separated from the rest\nof the MOs spectrum.2\nNevertheless, new types of molecular solids have been recently synthesized, for instance, aiming at the metalization\nof the single-component molecular solids family M (tmdt)2\n(M = Ni, Au),9 where tmdt stands for trimethylenetetrathiafulvalenedithiolate. The molecular extension of the tmdt system is so large that a description based on a single molecular orbital (MO) is questionable. As a matter of fact,\nab initio calculations have been performed10\u201312 and an effective three-band Hubbard model has been proposed and\nsucceeded in describing electronic structures.13 In this respect, the quasi-one-dimensional molecular compound (TTMTTP)I3 ,14\u201316 where TTM-TTP=2,5-bis(4,5-bis(methylthio)1,3-dithiol-2-ylidene)-1,3,4,6-tetrathiapentalene looks like a\npromising candidate to investigate the theory limitation of a\nsingle-MO approximation. The presence of an I\u2212\n3 counteranion is suggestive of formally organic [TTM-TTP]+ cations\nin the crystal structure, i.e., unpaired electrons localized\nwithin the organic moieties. The magnetic susceptibility17,18\nand NMR measurements19,20 revealed phase transitions at finite temperature. Insulating and non-magnetic behaviors have\nbeen confirmed at low-temperature. Furthermore, based on\n\nRaman-scattering21\u201323 and x-ray measurements,24 it has been\nsuggested that an asymmetric deformation of the [TTM-TTP]\nmolecule occurs and charge disproportionation within the\nmolecule is possible below a transition temperature. This\nnovel charge-ordered (CO) state is different from the conventional CO state2 and is called intramolecular CO state.23\nThis nontrivial phenomena observed in this particular compound may not be described using a single-band description,\ni.e., the present molecular assembly could give rise to a phenomenon beyond a concept expected from a knowledge of\na single molecule although the trigger may be hidden in the\nproperties of multi molecular orbitals. Thus, there is a crucial need for theoretical description to rationalize the origin\nof such state. The purposes of our study are (i) to show that\nthe energy of singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) and\nthat of second-highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO1) are quasidegenerate, (ii) to clarify the origin of this quasidegeneracy using an effective three-fragment model for the\n[TTM-TTP] molecule, and (iii) to show explicitly that the intramolecular charge ordering actually occurs in the neighboring two-molecular system. With this goal in mind, multireference wave function-based ab initio calculations are performed\nto rationalize the electronic distribution in the (TTM-TTP)I3\nmaterial.\nII. MOS OF THE [TTM-TTP]+ ION\n\nThe [TTM-TTP] organic molecule C14 S12 H12 is shown in\nFig. 1. The atomic coordinates are read from the (TTMTTP)I3 298 K crystal structure.15 In order to assess the packing influence in the electron trapping phenomenon, we did not\nperform any geometry optimization. Based on this structure,\nwe performed correlated ab initio calculations. This type of\napproach is very insightful since important information is accessible through a reading of the wave function. In particular,\ncomplete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) calculations have turned out to be very efficient to unravel intriguing\nelectronic distribution in organic radical-based materials.25\u201328\nOn top of the CASSCF wave functions, second-order perturbation theory calculations (CASPT2) were performed using\nan imaginary shift of 0.3 a.u. and an ionization potentialelectronic affinity (IPEA) shift of 0.0 a.u. The IPEA shift\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: [TTM-TTP] molecule (right-top) and energy levels of the\nisolated [TTM-TTP]+ ion from ROHF ab initio SCF calculations.\nThe SOMO (u) and HOMO-1 (g) are drawn where the red and blue\ncolors denote the sign of orbital.\n\naims at correcting the energy differences calculations between\nstates holding different open shells. Since we are dealing with\nspin states, it would be irrelevant to turn on this parameter.29,30\nThis procedure allows one to incorporate the important dynamical correlation effects to reach a high level of accuracy.\nAll our ab initio calculations were performed using the MOLCAS package31 with all electron basis sets contractions for\nthe elements S(7s6p1d)/[4s3p1d], C(5s5p1d)/[3s2p1d] and H\n(3s)/[1s]. We checked the validity of these particular contractions by including diffuse and polarization functions which\ndid not lead to any quantitative changes.\nAt room-temperature, the [TTM-TTP] molecule exhibits an\ninversion center. Thus, the MOs can be classified as gerade (g) or ungerade (u) according to the symmetry point\ngroup. As mentioned before, the (TTM-TTP)I3 material is\na charge-transfer salt, consisting of [TTM-TTP]+ and I\u2212\n3\nspecies. In a simple picture, the HOMO of the [TTM-TTP]+\nion is half-filled, i.e., SOMO. It has been usually recognized\nthat one may concentrate on this SOMO, ignoring the rest\nof the spectrum on the assumption that its energy is well\nisolated from those of the other orbitals as compared to the\nbandwidth.16 This is one particular issue we wanted to examine. Thus, semiempirical extended H\u00fcckel calculations were\nfirst performed.32,33 In the following, the SOMO and HOMO1 will be referred to as the u and g orbitals, respectively (see\nFig. 1). The energy separation between the g and u valence\nMOs (see Fig. 1) is \u2248 0.2 eV, while the bandwidth of the\nHOMO is \u2248 1 eV.16 Thus, the effect of the g orbital might not\nbe negligible since it is likely to participate in the intramolecular CO phenomenon expected in the (TTM-TTP)I3 system. In\norder to clarify the charge distribution, CASSCF calculations\nwere then carried out allowing the occupation of two MOs\nby three electrons, i.e., CAS[3,2]. This method is known to\nprovide very satisfactory charge distribution as soon as the\nactive space is flexible enough. The g and u MOs are then\ntreated on the same footing and both symmetries states can\nbe examined along these calculations. The CASSCF energy\ndifference between the g and u doublets is \u2248 0.5 eV, confirming the relative proximity of the frontier orbitals. The energy\nspectrum was finally calculated using a restricted open-shell\n\nFIG. 2: Effective three-fragment model for the u MO (a) and the g\nMO (b). The three fragments are named as L, R, and C, representing the left, right, and center fragments, and their wave functions are\n\u03c6L , \u03c6R , and \u03c6C , respectively. The u MO is given by the superposition of \u03c6L , \u2212\u03c6C , and \u03c6R , while the g MO is made of \u03c6L and \u2212\u03c6R .\nThe mutual interaction between the respective fragments are tb and\nts , representing the through-bond and through-space interactions, respectively.\n\nSCF (ROHF) procedure. Along these ROHF calculations,\nthree electrons are likely to occupy the frontier MOs u and\ng. These MOs are likely to be singly occupied or doubly occupied in the CASSCF calculations. In order to position the\ncorresponding energies, we performed a ROHF calculation assuming an average number of electrons in the g and u MOs,\ni.e., 1.5 electrons. The calculated energy levels in the vicinity of the SOMO are shown in Fig. 1. From this inspection,\nthe SOMO has ungerade character, whereas the HOMO-1 is\ngerade type in agreement with our extended H\u00fcckel calculations. The respective ROHF energies \u03b5u = \u22128.27 eV and\n\u03b5g = \u22128.69 eV, while the energy difference between the u and\ng MOs is \u2248 0.4 eV, a value which is consistent with our extended H\u00fcckel estimation. This combined semiempirical and\nab initio information upon the constitutive unit [TTM-TTP]+\nraises the relevance of a one-band approach to examine the\nelectronic properties of (TTM-TTP)I3 crystal.\n\nIII.\n\nEFFECTIVE THREE-FRAGMENT MODEL\n\nIn this section, we analyze the chemical origin of the closein-energy character of the g and u MOs. Let us split the [TTMTTP] molecule into 3 fragments-L, R, and C-as shown in\nFig. 2. The L and R parts represent the left and right parts\nof the [TTM-TTP] molecule, whereas C corresponds to the\nethylene-type bridging moiety. Based on this fragments picture, the u MO displays \"bonding\" character while the g MO\nis \"anti-bonding\". Therefore, one may wonder why the bonding MO lies higher in energy than the anti-bonding one. Part\nof the answer can be found in the C group orbital u which is\nlikely to mix in the L-R \"bonding\" orbital (see Fig. 2). As\nfor the interaction between these fragments, we consider two\ntypes of hopping integrals here, namely, tb and ts . The former accounts for the through-bond interaction, while the latter\nrepresents the through-space interaction. The energy levels of\nthe isolated L and R fragments are identical, and set to \u03b50 . On\nthe other hand, the energy level of the isolated C fragment is\nmuch lower than the L and R fragments, and we parametrize\nthe energy difference as \u2206\u03b5 (> 0). Using the local orbitals\n\n\f3\n\u03c6L , \u03c6R , and \u03c6C shown in Fig. 2, the effective Hamiltonian\nfor the 3-fragment model reads\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u03b50 \u2212ts\n\u2212tb\nL\n\uf8ed \u2212ts \u03b50\n\u2212tb \uf8f8 R\n(1)\n\u2212tb \u2212tb \u03b50 \u2212 \u2206\u03b5\nC\nFirst, let us neglect the through-bond tb interaction. The\nthrough-space interaction between the L and R parts results\nin bonding and antibonding MOs whose energy difference is\n2ts . This virtual situation is shown in the center of Fig. 3. As\nsoon as the tb interaction is turned on, the energy of the bonding MO is shifted higher, while the anti-bonding MO remain\nunchanged due to symmetry constraints. Assuming that \u2206\u03b5 is\nmuch larger than |tb |, the eigenvalues read\n\u03b5 u \u2248 \u03b5 0 \u2212 ts +\n\n2t2b\n,\n\u2206\u03b5\n\n(2a)\n\n\u03b5 g = \u03b5 0 + ts ,\n\u03b5u\u2032 \u2248 \u03b50 \u2212 \u2206\u03b5 \u2212\n\n(2b)\n2t2b\n\u2206\u03b5\n\n.\n\n(2c)\n\nThe respective wave functions are given by\n1\n[(\u03c6L + \u03c6R ) \u2212 a\u03c6C ],\n\u03c6u = \u221a\n2 + a2\n1\n\u03c6g = \u221a (\u03c6L \u2212 \u03c6R ),\n2\ni\nh\n\u22121\na\n\u03c6u\u2032 = p\n\u03c6C + (\u03c6L + \u03c6R ) ,\n2\n1 + a2 /2\n\n(3a)\n(3b)\n(3c)\n\nwhere the quantity a is given by a \u2248 (2tb /\u2206\u03b5). In this picture, the L, R and C fragments wave functions are assumed\nto be orthogonal which is obviously not a limitation for the\ndescription. By comparing Eq. (3) with the u and g MOs\nshown in Fig. 1, one can conclude distinctly that the wave\nfunctions \u03c6u and \u03c6g correspond to the u and g MOs, respectively. To scope out the \u03c6u\u2032 MO which is given in Eq. (3c),\n\nFIG. 3: MOs diagram for the effective three-fragment model of the\n[TTM-TTP] molecule. As the through-space interaction ts is turned\non, the L and R local orbitals mix in and result in bonding and antibonding MOs (center). Then, the through-bond interaction tb pushes\nthe bonding MOs higher in energy (right). The identified MOs, u, g,\nand, uinner , which are obtained from the SCF calculations, are also\nshown. The respective eigen-energies are given by \u03b5u = \u22128.27 eV,\n\u03b5g = \u22128.69 eV, and \u03b5uinner = \u221219.59 eV.\n\nFIG. 4: The L and R MOs obtained through a unitary transformation\nof Eq. (3) by taking a = 0.25.\n\nwe look into the set of ungerade MOs obtained from the SCF\ncalculations. The in-phase combination uinner of \u03c6L , \u03c6R ,\nand \u03c6C wave functions is shown in Fig.3 and its energy is\n\u03b5uinner = \u221219.59 eV. Since a typical value for |tb | is of the\norder of several eV, the latter energy separation fully justifies\nthe approximate expressions given previously. Thus, we can\nassign the \u03c6u\u2032 wave function to the uinner MO identified in the\nSCF calculations.\nThe ratio 2tb /\u2206\u03b5(\u2248 a) was estimated from the charge\ndistribution in the [TTM-TTP]+ ion, i.e., so-called Mulliken charges. Based upon the CAS[3,2] wave functions,\nCASPT2 calculations were performed and the resulting Mulliken charges were estimated. Following the three-fragment\nmodel, we summedPup the Mulliken charges within each fragment, e.g., \u03c1L =\ni\u2208L \u03c1i where \u03c1i is the charge of the respective atoms. In the ground state configuration where the u\nMO is singly occupied, the Mulliken charges on the respective\nfragments of the [TTM-TTP]+ ion were estimated as\n\u03c1L = \u03c1R = +0.634,\n\n\u03c1C = \u22120.268.\n\n(4)\n\nThe total charge is \u03c1L + \u03c1R + \u03c1C = +1. In order to extract the contribution from the SOMO, we analyzed the charge\ndifference between the cation [TTM-TTP]+ and the [TTMTTP] molecule. The latter exhibits the following Mulliken\ncharges on the respective fragments \u03c10L = \u03c10R = +0.149 and\n\u03c10C = \u22120.297. Thus, the charge differences \u2206\u03c1Z \u2261 (\u03c1Z \u2212\u03c10Z )\n(Z = L, R, C) were calculated as\n\u2206\u03c1L = \u2206\u03c1R = 0.485,\n\n\u2206\u03c1C = 0.029.\n\n(5)\n\nThis means that the hole is mainly localized on the L and\nR fragments, whereas the charge on the C fragment remains\nalmost unchanged. By combining the information upon the\nSOMO [Eq. (3a)] and the numerical data of the charge distribution [Eq. (5)], we can estimate the parameter a \u2248 (2tb /\u2206\u03b5)\nby using the relations 1/(2 + a2 ) = \u2206\u03c1L or a2 /(2 + a2 ) =\n\u2206\u03c1C . Based on this analysis, we find a \u2248 0.25 and finally\nthe ratio (tb /\u2206\u03b5) is \u2248 0.12. Once the parameter a is determined, the fragment wave functions can be obtained explicitly\nthrough the inverse unitary transformation of Eq. (3). The resulting L and R MOs are shown in Fig. 4 and correspond to\nthe \u03c6L and \u03c6R local MOs. Since [(\u03b5u + \u03b5g )/2 \u2212 \u03b5uinner ] =\n\u2206\u03b5[1 + 3(tb /\u2206\u03b5)2 ] [see Eq. (2)], the ROHF eigenvalues\n\u03b5u = \u22128.27 eV, \u03b5g = \u22128.69 eV, and \u03b5uinner = \u221219.59 eV\nlead to the effective energy of the C fragment \u2206\u03b5 \u2248 10.6 eV.\nFinally, the magnitudes of the through-bond/through-space interactions can be estimated, tb \u2248 1.32 eV and ts \u2248 \u22120.04 eV.\nFrom our evaluation, ts is almost negligible, and the bonding\nand antibonding MOs of Fig. 3 are almost degenerated. The\n\n\f4\nthrough-space integral is much smaller than the through-bond\none, |tb /ts | \u2248 28. Since the energy difference between the u\nand g MOs is determined from Eq. (2)\n\u03b5u \u2212 \u03b5g \u2248 \u22122ts +\n\n2t2b\n,\n\u2206\u03b5\n\n(6)\n\nthe origin of the quasidegeneracy of the u and g MOs can be\nclarified in the light of the extracted parameters.\nIn conclusion, the u and g MOs ordering is completely\ndetermined by the relative energetics of this three-piece\nmolecule. The through-space interaction ts is almost negligible, while through-bond interaction tb determines the energy\nspectrum.\n\nFIG. 5: Valence MOs of the [TTM-TTP]2+\n2 system obtained from\nCAS[6,4]SCF ab initio calculations upon the singlet state of g symmetry.\n\nIV. INTRAMOLECULAR CHARGE ORDERING\n\nIn this section, the interactions between neighboring [TTMTTP]+ cations have been investigated using a dimer extracted\nfrom the (TTM-TTP)I3 crystal. We used the atomic coordinates of the crystal structure at 298 K. If the crystal-structure\ndata at low-temperature phase were available, we may perform more quantitative analysis by combining the geometrical\noptimization. However, it can be considered that the following\nresults are not affected qualitatively. Since we were not only\ninterested in charge distribution, CASPT2 calculations were\nalso performed to specify the low-energy spectroscopy of the\n[TTM-TTP]2+\n2 dimer.\nA.\n\n\"MOs\"\n\nFirst, CASSCF calculations were carried out on the [TTMTTP]2+\n2 dimer. These calculations were performed including\nsix electrons in four MOs in the active space (CAS[6,4]) to\naccount for the important static correlation effects. The interactions between the neighboring [TTM-TTP]+ ions labeled as\nI and II give rise to the effective MOs shown in Fig. 5. Importantly, the dimer exhibits an inversion center and the resulting\nMOs can be classified into gerade and ungerade. Nevertheless, the inversion center of each individual subunit is lost,\nwhich might lead to electron localization within the [TTMTTP]+ building blocks. As expected, the CAS[6,4]SCF frontier orbitals (Fig. 5) consist in the in-phase and out-of-phase\ncombinations of the \u03c6L,I , \u03c6R,I , \u03c6L,II , and \u03c6R,II MOs. The\n\u03c6L,I and \u03c6R,I are the left (L) and right (R) localized MOs on\nthe subunit I (see Fig. 4). A similar definition holds for the\nsubunit II.\nFrom the subsequent CASPT2 treatment, the ground state is\na gerade singlet, and the active MOs exhibit occupation numbers 2.0, 2.0, 0.9, and 1.1, respectively. Importantly, the occupation numbers of the g2 and u2 MOs strongly deviate from\n2 and 0, a feature of the open-shell nature of the ground state\nsinglet. The symmetry breaking within each [TTM-TTP]+\nion induced by the presence of a second partner leads to a\nmixing of the orbitals depicted in Fig. 3. This particular mechanism is likely to result in the charge ordering we now wish to\nexamine.\n\nB. Mulliken charge\n\nFrom the CASPT2 calculations performed upon the [TTMTTP]2+\n2 dimer, a similar Mulliken charge analysis was carried out to quantify the charge redistribution accompanying\nthe dimer formation. The ground singlet state exhibits the\nfollowing charge reorganization as compared to the isolated\nneutral [TTM-TTP] molecule\n\u2206\u03c1L = 0.697,\n\n\u2206\u03c1R = 0.272,\n\n\u2206\u03c1C = 0.030.\n\n(7)\n\nAs a major conclusion, the charge on the left (right) fragment\nis strongly enhanced (reduced), which is a clear indication of\nthe intramolecular charge ordering. Again, the charge on the\ncenter fragment C is almost unchanged. The present evaluation based on the two-molecule dimer overestimates the\ncharge difference between the L and R fragments as compared to its value in the crystal, and also the validity of Mulliken charges remains questionable since the fluctuation effects were not included. Nevertheless, this qualitative analysis\nsupports the intramolecular CO state.\nC. Low-energy spectroscopy\n\nOur Mulliken charge analysis is suggestive of an intramolecular charge ordering mechanism in the (TTM-TTP)I3\nmaterial. Thus, one may expect a charge localization on the\nleft or right parts of the TTM-TTP building blocks. Such scenario is likely to give rise to magnetic interactions involving\neither the inner parts (i.e., \u03c6R,I and \u03c6L,II fragments MOs) or\nthe outer parts (i.e., \u03c6L,I and \u03c6R,II ).\nThus, starting from the CAS[6,4]SCF calculations, the lowenergy spectroscopy of the [TTM-TTP]2+\nspecies was in2\nspected. The multi-reference CASSCF wave functions were\nexpanded using a local orbitals basis set {\u03c6L,I , \u03c6R,I , \u03c6L,II ,\n\u03c6R,II } following the transformation\n1\n\u03c6g1 \u2248 \u221a (\u2212\u03c6R,I + \u03c6L,II ),\n2\n1\n\u03c6u1 \u2248 \u221a (\u2212\u03c6R,I \u2212 \u03c6L,II ),\n2\n\n(8a)\n(8b)\n\n\f5\nTABLE I: Wave functions decompositions (weights) of the [TTM-TTP]2+\n2 low-energy states.

Such transformation affords a reading of\nthe different wave functions and the extractions of the relevant\ninformation in a valence-bond type analysis. Since |ts | is relatively small, the left and right moieties within each unit do\nnot significantly overlap. Thus, the previous transformation is\nalmost unitary.\nThe lowest lying states of the [TTM-TTP]2+\n2 species are\ngiven in Table I. The ground state is singlet g and consistent with a picture that minimizes the electrostatic energy between the two [TTM-TTP]+ ions. The comparison between\nthe ground state singlet g and first triplet u is very instructive. In both cases, the wave function is largely dominated by\nthe electronic configurations (84 % and 62 % in Table I for\nthe singlet and triplet states, respectively) involving the inner\nparts (see Fig. 6).

Such a value\nsuggests that the spin gap excitation energy should be \u2248 900\nK. The first-excited singlet corresponds to the holes localization within one [TTM-TTP]+ ion. This is a reflection of an\nintermolecular charge ordering which lies much higher and\nmight not be relevant to describe the low-energy properties of\nthe (TTM-TTP)I3 material. The energy difference (0.35 eV)\nbetween this second excited state (singlet g) and the fourth\none (triplet u) supports the strong antiferromagnetic interaction within each subunit. This is a mechanism that involves\nagain intermolecular electron transfer. The low-energy spectroscopy in the (TTM-TTP)I3 material should be mostly governed by the through-space interdimer magnetic interaction J,\nwhich results from the intramolecular charge ordering.\nV.\n\nSUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS\n\nIn the present paper, we examined the low-energy properties of the (TTM-TTP)I3 material. Complementary semiempirical and wave function-based ab initio calculations were\nperformed upon the elementary unit and a dimer to investigate the underlying electronic distribution. We showed that\nthe SOMO and HOMO-1 are close in energy and that a oneband picture should be ruled out. A chemical understanding\narises from the inspection of the building block and effective\nparameters extracted from a three-fragment model allowed us\nto rationalize the quasidegeneracy of the [TTM-TTP] frontier MOs. From the calculation of a system consisting of\ntwo neighboring molecules, the inversion symmetry within\neach molecule is lost. This result is in agreement with experimental data. Indeed, the intramolecular charge ordering\nwhich has been experimentally suggested actually occurs in\nthe two-molecule cluster system. The mixing of the SOMO\nand HOMO-1 results in an electron trapping which results in\na 0.697 / 0.272 on the L / R moieties of the [TTM-TTP]+\nion. Finally, our ab initio calculations suggest that the lowenergy of the (TTM-TTP)I3 material is controlled by a single\nexchange interaction 0.09 eV, resulting from the charge ordering.\nIn order to complement our Mulliken charge analysis, we\nalso performed preliminary Raman and infrared (IR) calcu-\n\n\f6\nlations upon the [TTM-TTP]+ unit. It has been observed\nupon cooling that the Raman 1490 cm\u22121 band splits into two\npeaks centered at 1487 cm\u22121 and 1499 cm\u22121 , where this\nphenomenon was attributed to the differentiation between the\nC=C ylidene bonds, featuring a symmetry breaking.21 We\nused the GAUSSIAN 03 package34 on isolated one- and twomolecule systems, and full geometry optimizations were carried out on both systems. The information extracted from\nthe one-molecule system should be compared with the hightemperature regime. In contrast, the two-molecule system\nis expected to give access to the low-temperature Raman\nspectrum characteristics. The calculated spectrum of twomolecule system displays two vibrational frequencies, 1522\ncm\u22121 and 1534 cm\u22121 , while that of the 1-molecule system\nshows a single band at 1535 cm\u22121 . Despite a general blueshift, this result is in agreement with experimental data, and\ncan be attributed to an intramolecular CO phase accompanying the descent in symmetry within the TTM-TTP units. In\nthis calculation, the [TTM-TTP]2+\n2 dimer was extracted from\nthe available crystallographic data. A direct comparison with\nexperimental findings would rely on Raman and IR calculations using the low-temperature crystal structure.
