In 1973, ties in social networks,\ngenerally, come in two varieties: strong and weak, which has been first proposed by the American\nsociologist Mark Granovetter in Ref. [2], one of the most influential sociology papers ever published.\nDifferent relationships can be measured in the currency of tie strength. According to the closeness,\nconnections to close friends have been said to be \"strong\" ties, while those to acquaintances have been\ncalled \"weak\" ties [2\u20136]. Tie strength usually plays an vital role in many real networks and is crucial\nto understand dynamical processes on the networks [6\u20138]. Strong ties are the people you really trust,\npeople whose social circles tightly overlap with your own. Often, they are also the people most like you.\nWeak ties, conversely, are merely acquaintances and often provide access to novel information [6]. Weak\nties display an important bridging function [7], while strong ties are more likely to activated for the flow\nof referral information and more influential than weak ties [8]. In addition, weak ties could play a more\nsignificant role than strong ties to keep the stability [9], maintain the connectivity [10] and uncover the\nmissing information [11].\nIn despite of the qualitative distinction between strong and weak ties, the tie strength could be\nquantitatively described by edge weight-the edges with high weights are considered to be strong. In a\nnumber of social networks, edges are often associated with weights that differentiate them in terms of their\n\n\f2\nstrength, intensity, capacity or the frequency of recent contacts [2, 12]. For non-social networks, weights\noften refer to the functions performed by edges, e.g., the amount of traffic flowing along connections in\nworld-wide airport networks [12], the number of joint papers of two coauthors in scientist collaboration\nnetworks [12], the number of synapses and gap junctions in neural networks [13], the carbon flow between\nspecies in food webs [14]. Yan et al. [15] investigated the epidemic spreading in weighted scale-free\nnetworks and the simulation results indicated that the more homogeneous weight distribution of the\nnetwork, the more quickly epidemic spreads on it. This finding was further demonstrated by an edgebased mean-field solution [16]. Chu et al. [17] showed that the weight distribution has strong impacts\non both epidemic threshold and prevalence. Baronchelli and Pastor-Satorras [18] considered the diffusive\ndynamics on weighted networks and shed light on the validity of mean-field theory on weighted networks.\nThese studies revealed quantitative impacts of edges with different weights, but ignored the qualitatively\ndifferent roles respectively played by strong and weak ties.\nIn this paper, we propose a quantitative method to uncover the qualitatively different roles of strong\nand weak ties via a weighted susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model. Experimental results on six\nreal networks emphasize the different roles of strong and weak ties: the former improve the steady-state\nfraction of infected nodes while the latter fasten the spreading speed.\n\nResults\nModel\nThe SIS model [19] is suitable to describe the cases when the individuals cannot acquire immunity after\nrecovering from the disease, such as influenza, pulmonary tuberculosis and gonorrhea. With disease of this\nkind individuals that are cured usually catch again. In the networked SIS model, nodes are in two discrete\nstates, \"susceptible\" or \"infected\". Each infected node will contact all its neighbors once at each time\nstep, and therefore the infectivity of each node is proportional to its degree. In the real world, individuals\nmay be only able to contact limited population within one time step [20]. For example, salesman in\nnetwork marketing processes will not make referrals to all his acquaintances due to the limited money\nand time [21]. In sexual contact networks, although a few individuals have hundreds of sexual partners,\ntheir sexual activities are not far beyond a normal level due to the physiological limitations [22, 23].\nTherefore, in the present model we assume every individual has the same infectivity [20,24]. Without the\nlose of generality, at each time step, each infected node will select one of its neighbors to contact. If the\nselected neighbor has been infected already, nothing happens, while if it is susceptible, with probability\n\u03b1, it will be infected. Meanwhile, each infected node will become susceptible in the next time step with\nprobability \u03b2. The probability an infected node i will select its neighbor j is\npij = P\n\nsbij\nl\u2208\u0393i\n\nsbil\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u0393i is the neighbor set of node i, sij denotes the tie strength between i and j, and b is a tunable\nparameter. If b = 0, the infected node randomly selects a neighbor to contact. If b > 0, strong ties are\nfavored to constitute the paths of spreading, while if b < 0, weak ties are favored.\nIn different contexts, the strength of a tie may have different definitions and measures [25, 26], which\nmay depend on external information to network topology. For general networks, one may be not aware\nof external information and thus it is meaningful to give a natural definition solely based on network\ntopology. According to Rapoport's theory [1] and other supportive observations [27\u201329] and models\n[30, 31], we define the tie strength sij in spite of i and j's common neighbors, as follows:\nnij + \u03b4\n,\nsij = p\nki kj\n\n(2)\n\n\f3\nwhere nij is the number of common neighbors of i and j, ki is the degree of i, and \u03b4 is a constant that\ngives chance to the tie connecting two nodes without common neighbors. For simplicity, we set \u03b4 = 1.\nThe dynamical process starts with randomly selecting a certain number of infected nodes.\n\nData\nTo see the impacts of tie strength on the spreading dynamics, experiments are carried out on six real\nnetworks: (1) Facebook-like Social Network (FSN) [32]: it originates from an online community for\nstudents at University of California. The dataset includes the users that have sent or received at least\none message, and an undirected edge is set between i and j if i has sent (received) an online message to\n(from) j. (2) Enron Email Network (EEN) [33, 34]: it covers about half million emails. Nodes of this\nnetwork are email addresses and if an address i sent at least one email to address j, an undirected edge is\nestablished between i and j. (3) Slashdot Social Network (SSN) [35]: nodes in this network are the users\nin Slashdot, which is a technology-related news website, and edges represent friendships between users.\n(4) Epinions Social Network (ESN) [36]: this is a who-trust-whom online social network. Nodes are the\nmembers of the general consumer review site Epinions.com, and edges represent the trust relationships\nbetween two members. (5) Gnutella Peer-to-peer Network (GPN) [37]: Nodes represent hosts and edges\nstand for connections between the hosts. (6) Oregon Autonomous Systems (OAS) [38]: this is an AS-level\nInternet topology graph obtained by the Route Views Project. In order to guarantee the connectivity,\nwe use the largest connected components of these networks. Table 1 presents the basic statistics of the\nlargest connected components of the six networks.\n\nResults and Analysis\nAll simulations start with 20 randomly selected nodes as infected sources, with infectivity rate \u03b1 = 0.4 and\nrecovery rate \u03b2 = 0.1. Figure 1 gives us intuition of the spreading processes following the proposed model,\nin which one can obverse the number of infected nodes, I(t), changing with time, t, and considerable\neffects made by b. We next investigate b's impacts on two macroscopic features of the spreading process-\nthe prevalence and speed. The first one is characterized by the fraction of infected nodes in the steady\nstate, \u03c1 = I(\u221e)/N . For the second one, if we define \u2206I(t) := I(\u221e) \u2212 I(t), it converges to zero following\nan exponential form (it is easy to be checked numerically and thus not shown here), \u2206I(t) \u221d e\u2212\u03bbt , and\nthe parameter \u03bb is an informative index for the converging speed. The larger \u03c1 the wider the spreading,\nand the larger \u03bb the faster the spreading.\nFigure 2 displays how the steady-state infection density \u03c1 and the speed index \u03bb change with b based\non the six real networks. For each case, there are well-defined peaks for both \u03c1(b) and \u03bb(b). More\ninterestingly, in every case, all the \"optimal\" values of b subject to high prevalence are larger than zero,\nwhile all the \"optimal\" values of b subject to high speed are smaller than zero. These phenomena indicate\nthe different roles of strong and weak ties: the former operate locally and keep a high prevalence in local\nsurrounding while the latter bridge different densely connected groups and enhance the chance to infect\nhealthy groups. As an imprecise metaphor to global epidemic spreading, the strong ties are similar to\nthe urban buses and gathering places while the weak ties are similar to the intercity trains and airlines.\nTo emphasize the significance of our findings, we further consider the null model, where strengths are\ncompletely redistributed. This randomization operation destroys the correlation between structure and\nstrength. Figure 3 reports \u03c1(b) for real networks and the corresponding randomized networks. Different\nfrom the positive peaks for real networks, all peaks for randomized networks are at b = 0. Figure 4 shows\n\u03bb(b) for real networks and the corresponding randomized networks, again, peaks for randomized networks\nare all at b = 0. The results are in accordance with the known conclusion [16] that in the absence of\ncorrelation between structure and weight, the most homogeneous weight distribution leads to the widest\nand fastest epidemic spreading. Comparison between results from real and randomized cases suggests\nthat the non-zero \"optimal\" values of the parameter b do reveal some significant features of reality.\n\n\f4\n\nDiscussion\nWe studied a weighted SIS model where an edge's weight is functionally dependent on its strength.\nMotivated by the transitivity in social network analysis [39] and the Rapoport's theory [1], we apply a\ncommon-neighborhood-based similarity index to quantify edge strength. By comparing the experimental\nresults on six real networks and their counterpart randomized networks, we show that strong and weak\nties play distinguishable roles in spreading dynamics: the former enlarge the infected density while the\nlatter fasten the process.\nNote that, the optimal values of b subject to the infected density and spreading speed are far different,\nindicating that the \"optimization\" of an spreading process could have multiple performance indices and\nthese indices may conflict to each other. Analogous examples are numerous: bypassing main intersections\nand arterial roads could enhance the network throughput while increase the delivering time especially\nin uncongested states [40], and removing directed loops could enhance the synchronizability while slow\ndown the synchronizing process [41]. Our method provides a quantitative way to reveal the qualitatively\ndifferent roles of ties (also can be extended to deal with nodes) in such dynamical processes.\nWe hope this work could contribute to the long journey towards fully understanding the relations\nbetween structural features and functional performances. Along this way, more experiments on disparate\nnetworks will benefit us, and we will look into benchmark network models to see whether some structural\nproperties, such as the presence of degree-degree correlation and community structure, are responsible\nfor the observations reported here.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe acknowledge Pak-Ming Hui for valuable discussions.
