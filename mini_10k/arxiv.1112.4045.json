To that, Niels\nBohr used to reply to stop telling God what s/he has to\ndo with her/his dice. John. G. Cramer, in more recent\ntimes, added to this the following [1]: \"If 'God plays dice,'\nas Einstein (1932) has declined to believe, one would at\nleast like a glimpse of the gaming apparatus that is in\nuse.\"\nHaving a glimpse of the apparatus means to understand the nature of the game that is played behind the\nquantum scenes, and this in turn means to understand\nquantum mechanics, something which most physicists believe is a hopeless goal, in accordance with Richard Feynman celebrated admonition [2]: \"[...] that nobody understands quantum mechanics.\"\nBut what does it mean to understand quantum mechanics? And, more generally, what does it mean to understand something in science? Different (more or less\nsophisticated) answers are of course possible, depending\non the perspective which is adopted. But the majority\nof scientists will certainly agree that, roughly speaking,\nto understand in science means to build a theory with\na sufficient explanatory power, which can suitably elucidate the observed phenomena and make confirmable\npredictions. Then, why quantum mechanics, which today\nhas reached the level of a fully mathematized theory, and\nwhose predictions have been confirmed experimentally to\nan extremely high degree of accuracy, is still considered a\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: autoricerca@gmail.com\n\ntheory that nobody really understand, as Feynman used\nto proclaim?\nAgain, the answer to this question will vary depending\non the physicist that respond, but the majority will certainly say that although quantum theory describes and\npredicts with accuracy the behavior of quantum entities,\nthe problem is that their behavior has nothing to do with\nthat of classical macroscopic entities of our everyday experience. Therefore, we simply lack of concrete models\nthat would allow us to visualize a quantum entity and\nunderstand, by analogy, its behavior, since we humans\ncan only visualize models made of concrete objects, belonging to our ordinary spacetime theatre.\nLet us think for instance of an armilla (also known\nas spherical astrolabe): an ancient little model of the\nobjects in the sky, consisting of a spherical framework\nof graduated metal circles (\"armilla\" means \"circle\" in\nLatin), centered on Earth, representing the lines of celestial longitude and latitude, the ecliptic, and other astronomically important features. The armilla, which was\ninvented by the Greek astronomer Eratosthenes (276 -194\nBCE), was used, among other things, as a valid teaching\ntool, i.e., as a mean to conveniently visualize the structure and behavior of the astronomical solar system which,\notherwise, because of its astronomical size, would have\nbeen rather difficult to visualize as a whole, and therefore to understand.\nBeing the solar system an astronomical object, it is\nclear that any model of it will not be a real-size one,\nbut a miniature. And it is precisely because the armilla\nwas a miniature, whose structure could be viewed as a\nwhole, with a glance, that it had such a great explicative\npower and allowed to really understand the structure and\nbehavior of the solar system (from an ancient geocentric\n\n\f2\npoint of view).\nThe above is just to emphasize that the ability to create concrete, easily viewable models, is an important tool\nof the scientific enterprise, above all with regard to the\npossibility of fully understanding the functioning of the\nobjects of its study. Now, if for astronomical entities\nmodels have to be miniatures, when it is about the representation of microscopic entities, models of course have\nto be larger than the original. As a paradigmatic example, we can consider the many different large scale atomic\nmodels that have been used in the course of history, to\nvisualize and explore the atomic hypothesis.\nLet us think for instance of the very simple \"billiard\nball\" atomic models of Democritus and Dalton, the more\nsophisticated Thomson's \"plum pudding\" model, or the\nRutherford's \"armilla-like\" solar system model, subsequently modified by Bohr, by restricting the \"allowed\"\norbits and energies for the electronic satellites.\nThis is probably one of the reasons why Bohr's atomic\nmodel, despite being totally obsolete, is sometimes still\ntaught today as an introduction to quantum mechanics,\nas it has the merit of being somehow still viewable by the\nstudents, who have then the impression of understanding\nwhat's going on. But of course, Bohr's atomic model is\nalready a \"crazy\" one, and Bohr himself was accustomed\nto say that the real question was to determine whether\nit was crazy enough to have a chance of being right!\nAs we today all know, quantum theory, despite its\nweirdness, has certainly being confirmed to be right. But\nthe price we have paid for this is, apparently, to renounce\nthe possibility of understanding it. Indeed, what kind of\nmodel can we conceive today that would allow us to understand atoms without invoking magic images? (Like\nthe one of an elevator which, in the case of Bohr's model,\nwould be able to bring an electron to different floors, i.e.,\norbits, without ever sojourning in between of them).\nTo quote Heisenberg [3]: \"The atom of modern physics\ncan only be symbolized by a partial differential equation\nin an abstract multidimensional space. Only the experiment of an observer forces the atom to indicate a position,\na color and a quantity of heat. All the qualities of the\natom of modern physics are derived, it has no immediate and direct physical properties at all, i.e. every type\nof visual conception we might wish to design is, eo ipso,\nfaulty.\"\nThe same of course can be said about the constituents\nof the atomic structures, the so-called elementary particles, which in fact do not behave as particles, and can\ncertainly not be understood (i.e., visualized) as little tiny\ncorpuscles moving around in the three-dimensional Euclidean space [4, 5]. So, how should we understand the reality of the microscopic quantum entities? And, more importantly, can we understand it? The majority of physicists believe that such an understanding is simply impossible, and this because we lack of simple models (apart\nfrom the abstract model of the mathematical theory) that\nwould guide our intuition and allow us to understand the\nreasons for the observed quantum weirdness. But, is all\n\nthis true? Do we really lack of simple concrete models\nthat can help us to understand the behavior of elementary quantum entities?\nIn fact, and contrary to what is usually believed, these\nmodels exist, since many years now, and can certainly\nbe used to convincingly visualize some of the strange behaviors of quantum entities, as they interact with the\nexperimental contexts. They have been invented by the\nBelgian physicist Diederik Aerts, one of the founders of\nso-called Geneva-Brussels school on the foundations of\nphysics, and according to the present author their importance have been seriously underappreciated by the\nphysics community, despite the role they have played in\nclarifying many of the conceptual challenges of quantum\nphysics, and in facilitating the development of more advanced conceptual and mathematical formalisms that go\nbeyond the quantum (Hilbertian) and classical (phase\nspace) descriptions.\nAlso, apart their interest in sponsoring new innovative\napproaches to understand the complexity of our reality\n\u2013 like for instance the hidden-measurement approach [6\u2013\n9] and creation-discovery view [6, 7, 10] \u2013 these models\ncan be advantageously used to reveal what could be a\npossible physical content of the theory, beyond its rather\nabstract and counterintuitive formalism.\nIn this paper we shall present two of Aerts' historical quantum machine-models [45], whose operations are\nbased on simple breakable elastic bands. The first one\nis called the spin quantum machine, or sphere model [10,\n11], and can easily replicate the quantum probabilities\nassociated with the spin measurement of a spin-1/2 entity, for instance in a typical Stern-Gerlach experiment.\nThe model allows to understand what possibly distinguish quantum from classical probabilities: if the latter\ncorrespond to a situation of lack of knowledge about the\nstate of the system, the former may correspond to situations where there is full knowledge of the state of the\nentity, but maximum lack of knowledge about the interaction between the measurement apparatus and the\nentity.\nThe second machine-model that we shall describe is\ncalled the connected vessels of water model [13, 14, 23].\nAs its name indicates, the original model is constructed\nusing vessels, tubes and water. However, we shall present\nhere an alternative version of it, only using an elastic\nband, in accordance with the title of the present paper. The model is able to violate Bell's inequalities, as\ncoincidence measurements on entangled states can do,\nand since everything in it happens under our eyes, part\nof the mystery of so-called \"spooky actions at a distance\" (i.e., EPR non-local correlations) will be revealed,\nand therefore explained: Bell's inequalities (and corresponding Bell's locality hypothesis) can only be violated\nwhen, during a coincidence experiment, correlations that\nweren't present before the experiment are literally created by and during the experiment itself.\n\n\f3\nII.\n\nTHE SPIN QUANTUM-MACHINE MODEL\nA.\n\nThe spin-1/2 quantum entity\n\nBefore describing Aerts' spin quantum-machine\n(SQM), let us recall some of the basic properties of a\nspin-1/2 quantum entity. Its state |\u03c8i belongs to a 2dimensional Hilbert space H = C2 , and can always be\nrepresented as a superposition of \"up\" and \"down\" spin\nstates, relative to an a priori given direction \u1e91:\n|\u03c8i = \u03b1|+i\u1e91 + \u03b2|\u2212i\u1e91 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are complex numbers obeying the normalization condition |\u03b1|2 + |\u03b2|2 = 1.\n~ = (Sx\u0302 , S\u0177 , S\u1e91 ) the spin vector observIf we denote by S\nable, its components are known to obey the commutation\nrelation [Sx\u0302 , S\u0177 ] = i~S\u1e91 , and the equations:\nS\u1e91 |\u00b1i\u1e91\nSx\u0302 |\u00b1i\u1e91\n\n~\n= \u00b1 |\u00b1i\u1e91 ,\n2\n~\n~\n= |\u2213i\u1e91 , S\u0177 |\u00b1i\u1e91 = \u00b1i |\u2213i\u1e91 .\n2\n2\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\nonto the set of states having spin \"up\" along direction \u00fb.\nTherefore, according to Born rule, the probability that\na spin measurement along direction \u00fb gives the outcome\n\"up\" (i.e., value ~/2), when the system is prepared in\nstate |+iv\u0302 , is given by:\nP(v\u0302 \u2192 \u00fb) =\n\nv\u0302 h+|P\u00fb |+iv\u0302\n\n= | \u00fb h+|+iv\u0302 |2 .\n\n\u0012\n\n2\n\u03b3\nsin\n~\n2\n\n(6)\n\nTo calculate this probability, one can reason as follows:\nif \u03b3 = arccos (\u00fb * v\u0302) is the angle between v\u0302 and \u00fb, i.e., the\n\n\u0013\nSn\u0302 .\n\n(7)\n\nTherefore, considering that the unit vector n\u0302 is orthogonal to \u00fb, according to (3) we have \u00fb h+|Sn\u0302 |+i\u00fb = 0, and\none immediately finds that:\n\n(2)\n\nin Cartesian coordinates.\nAccording to the above one-to-one Pauli mapping, all\nspin states can be visualized as points on a 3-dimensional\nunit sphere, indexed by a specific unit vector (this is also\nknown as a Poincar\u00e9 sphere representation; see for instance the discussion in [41], pp. 26\u201328). More precisely,\nif |\u03c8i is given by (1), and v\u0302 is given by (4), then we\nhave |\u03c8i \u221d |+iv\u0302 (where the symbol \"\u221d\" means here\n\"equals, up to a non zero overall phase factor\"), and\nclearly |+i\u2212v\u0302 = |\u2212iv\u0302 .\nTo each unit vector \u00fb (i.e., to each point on the unit\nsphere), one can associate the projection operator\nP\u00fb = |+i\u00fb \u00fb h+|\n\n\u03b3\u0011\nRn\u0302 (\u03b3) = cos\nI\u2212i\n2\n\u0010\n\nP(v\u0302 \u2192 \u00fb) = cos2\n\nBecause of the normalization condition, one can always\nwrite (apart from a global phase factor with no physical\nmeaning) \u03b1 = cos \u03b82 exp \u2212i \u03c62 and \u03b2 = sin \u03b82 exp i \u03c62 , so\nthat if \u03b8 and \u03c6 are taken to be the polar angles of a unit\nvector v\u0302, then to each state vector |\u03c8i one can associate,\nbijectively, a unit vector v\u0302, which can be written as v\u0302 =\n(1, \u03b8, \u03c6) in polar coordinates, or as\nv\u0302 = (sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6, sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6, cos \u03b8)\n= (2<\u03b1\u2217 \u03b2, 2=\u03b1\u2217 \u03b2, |\u03b1|2 \u2212 |\u03b2|2 )\n\nangle that one needs to rotate v\u0302, along direction n\u0302 = v\u0302\u00d7\u00fb,\nto reach \u00fb, and if we denote by Rn\u0302 (\u03b3) = exp(\u2212i\u03b3Sn\u0302 /~)\n~ * n\u0302, we\nthe corresponding rotation operator, with Sn\u0302 = S\nhave |+iv\u0302 \u221d Rn\u0302 (\u03b3)|+i\u00fb .\nThen, exploiting the remarkable properties of the exponential function and of the spin 2 \u00d7 2 matrices (see any\ngood book of quantum mechanics), it is not difficult to\nshow that the rotation operator Rn\u0302 (\u03b3) can be written in\nthe simple form:\n\n\u03b3\n,\n2\n\n(8)\n\nand of course, since P\u00fb + P\u2212\u00fb = I, we also have\nP(v\u0302 \u2192 \u2212\u00fb) = sin2\n\n\u03b3\n.\n2\n\n(9)\n\nAs is well known, orthodox quantum mechanics doesn't\nexplain the reason of probabilities (8) and (9), i.e., where\nthe indeterminism they subtend comes from and how the\nsystem is able to actualize outcomes that are only potential prior to the measurement. Of course, what is lacking\nin the above description, and more generally in the axiomatic formulation of orthodox quantum mechanics, is\nthe measuring apparatus, i.e., a description of how the\napparatus precisely interacts with the system during an\nidealized measurement.\nIn the case of a spin measurement, the apparatus is for\ninstance the one used in a typical Stern-Gerlach experiment, made of a magnetic field with a strong gradient\n(exerting a torque on the magnetic moment of the quantum entity), plus a detection screen used to reveal which\nbeam deflection (upward or downward) has been actualized. Unfortunately, a direct observation of what exactly\nhappens \"behind the scenes,\" when the spin quantum\nentity interacts (in a non-local way) with the apparatus\nand manifests its presence by means of a specific (upward\nor downward) spot on the screen, appears to be beyond\nour today (and perhaps also our tomorrow) experimental\nabilities/possibilities.\nHowever, this doesn't mean we have to renounce to\nform a coherent picture of what's going on during the\nspin measurement, for instance by finding a meaningful\nstructural analogy that could reveal us what could be\nthe nature of the \"gaming apparatus\" in use. This is\nprecisely what Aerts did when he invented his numerous\nquantum-machines, which are (idealized) macroscopic ordinary objects able to reproduce, among other things, the\npuzzling non-Kolmogorovian quantum probabilities [46].\n\n\f4\nB.\n\nThe spin quantum-machine (SQM)\n\nLet us now describe the spin quantum-machine (SQM)\nand see how its functioning can simulate a spin-1/2 quantum measurement. The machine is very simple: it is\nconstituted by a single point particle localized inside the\nshell of a three-dimensional (Euclidean) empty sphere of\nunit radius, the possible states of which correspond to\nthe different places it can occupy on its internal surface.\nLet us assume that the point particle, in a given moment, is located in the position specified by the unit vector v\u0302. We introduce a specific class of experiments e\u00fb ,\nthat can be performed on it, which are so defined. To\ncarry out experiment e\u00fb , the following procedure has to\nbe executed: a uniform sticky elastic band is stripped between the two opposite points \u00fb and \u2212\u00fb, therefore passing through the centre of the sphere [Fig. 1, picture (1)].\nOnce the sticky elastic band is placed, one lets the point\nparticle \"fall\" from its original location (specified by v\u0302)\northogonally onto the elastic, and stick to it, in a given\npoint [Fig. 1, picture (2)].\nThen, one waits until the elastic breaks, at some unpredictable point (the rubber used to make the band is\nsuch that, once stretched, after a short time inevitably it\nbreaks), and therefore the particle, which is attached to\none of the two pieces of it, will be pulled to one of the\nopposite end points, \u00fb or \u2212\u00fb, thus producing the outcome of the experiment, i.e., the final position-state of\nthe particle, acquired as a result of the e\u00fb -measurement\n[Fig. 1, pictures (3) and (4)].\nOf course, the experimenter cannot know in advance\nin which point the elastic will break, as this depends on\na number of fluctuating factors which are totally beyond\nher/his possibility of control. However, s/he knows that\nthe elastic is uniform and therefore can reasonably assume that the probability that it will break in a given\nsegment is proportional to the length of that segment,\nand under this 'natural' hypothesis, s/he can easily calculate the probabilities associated to the two mutually\nexclusive outcomes.\nIndeed, the probability that the particle ends up in\npoint \u00b1\u00fb is given by the length L\u00b1 of the piece of elastic\nbetween the particle and the end-point, divided by the\ntotal length of the elastic (which is twice the unit radius).\nTherefore, if \u03b3 is the angle between v\u0302 and \u00fb, we obtain\nthat the probability for outcome \u00b1\u00fb is given by:\n1\nP(v\u0302 \u2192 \u00b1\u00fb) = (1 \u00b1 cos \u03b3) =\n2\n\n(\ncos2 \u03b32\nsin2 \u03b32 ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhich exactly corresponds to the previously calculated\nquantum probabilities (8) and (9), for measuring the spin\nS\u00fb of a spin-1/2 quantum entity prepared in state |+iv\u0302 .\nSo, the spin quantum machine, which is only made of\n(idealized) classical entities, is perfectly able to replicate\nthe behavior of a spin-1/2 entity, i.e., of a pure quantum\nentity, and produce the same probability calculus.\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nFIG. 1: A schematic representation of the spin quantum machine experiment, in the plane of the 3-dimensional sphere\nwhere it takes place. (1) The elastic band is stretched and\nfixed at the two diametrically opposite end points \u00fb and \u2212\u00fb,\nthen (2) the particle \"falls\" from its original place v\u0302 onto the\nelastic band, taking the shortest path, then sticks to it, thus\ndefining the two lenghts L+ and L\u2212 . (3) Finally, the elastic\nbreaks, thus contracts, carrying with it the particle, which (4)\nis then pulled to one of the opposite points (here \u00fb), defining\nits new state.\n\nC.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe SQM model reveals a number of important features of quantum systems that we are now going to discuss, but before doing that, let us point out an important difference between a spin-1/2 quantum entity and\nthe point particle of the SQM.\nWhen we want to determine the spin state of a quantum entity, all we can do is to perform measurements, for\ninstance by means of a Stern-Gerlach apparatus whose\nmagnetic field gradient is oriented along a given direction \u00fb. In the same way, in the SQM, one disposes of\nexperiments e\u00fb , which are the equivalent of the SternGerlach measurements.\nBut in the SQM one also has the possibility of looking\nin the machine and directly \"see\" the state position of the\npoint particle, as one can usually do, in principle, with\nwhatever classical corpuscle. This possibility, of directly\nlooking in the machine and discover, at any time, what's\nhappening, is precisely what confers the SQM its strong\nexplicative power, i.e., the possibility of fully visualizing\nthe measurement process, as it evolves.\nHowever, such an \"insight\" should not be considered as\na possibility to be used in practical terms, as an alternative to experiments e\u00fb , to determine the position-states\nof the point particle. As is the case with a spin-1/2 quan-\n\n\f5\ntum entity, we must here do as if the only experiments\nat our disposal to \"find out\" what are the locations of\nthe point particle on the sphere, are the e\u00fb ones, and no\nothers. Having said that, let us now observe what we can\nlearn from the structural analogy offered by the SQM.\nObserver effect. A quantum measurement, in general,\nchanges the state of the entity which is measured. This\nappears in very clear terms in the SQM: prior to the\ne\u00fb -experiment the point particle is in a position-state v\u0302,\nwhereas at the end of it its state is either \u00fb or \u2212\u00fb. This\nmeans that a quantum measurement cannot be considered as a process of mere discovery of properties that are\nalready possessed by the system prior to the experiment,\nbut as a process of creation of those same properties that\nare measured. To quote Pascual Jordan [16]: \"Observations not only disturb what has to be measured, they\nproduce it [...]. We compel [the electron] to assume a\ndefinite position [...]. We ourselves produce the results of\nmeasurements.\"\nIn other terms, the state (1) cannot be interpreted as a\ndescription of the experimenter's lack of knowledge about\nwhether the spin is \"up\" or \"down\" with respect to the \u1e91\ndirection, as these \"up\" and \"down\" outcomes are literally created during the interaction of the entity with the\nexperimental apparatus, and weren't existing prior to it.\nOf course, all this is already manifest in the quantum\nformalism, as is clear that states, represented by rays of\nthe Hilbert space, are typically changed by a measurement into other states, which are eigen-rays of the operator corresponding to the measurement. However, in the\nSQM we can explicitly observe that it is the invasiveness\nand unpredictability of the interaction between the entity and the measuring apparatus that is responsible for\nthe creation of a condition that wasn't actual before the\nexperiment.\nNon-commutativity. The non-commutativity of certain\nquantum observables (in the present case of Sx\u0302 , S\u0177 and\nS\u1e91 ) appears to be a direct consequence of the invasive\ncharacter of quantum measurements. Indeed, if what is\nmeasured is not discovered but created by the measurement, then the order with which one performs two subsequent measurements is going to deeply affect the final\noutcome, in the same way as putting on a sock, then a\nshoe, is not the same as putting on a shoe and then a\nsock.\nIn the SQM, non-commutativity is evidenced by the\nfact that, if one performs an experiment e\u00fb (the equivalent in the machine model of a measurement of spin\ncomponent S\u00fb ), followed by an experiment e\u0175 , the particle's final position will be either \u0175 or \u2212\u0175, whereas if\none performs first e\u0175 and then e\u00fb , the final position will\nbe either \u00fb or \u2212\u00fb. Therefore, if \u00fb 6= \u0175, these final states\nwill necessarily be different, showing that the two experiments are incompatible, as their order of execution is\nrelevant and cannot be commuted.\nHidden measurements. The nature of the interaction\nbetween the point particle and the elastic in the SQM\nmodel reveals a possible fascinating feature of quantum\n\nmeasurements. Imagine for a moment that, instead of a\nuniformly breakable elastic band, one uses a band that\ncan only break in a specific predetermined point x (the\nsphere's origin corresponding to x = 0). Given the initial\nposition-state v\u0302 of the point particle, it is clearly possible\nin this case to predict in advance if the outcome will be\n\u00fb or \u2212\u00fb. Indeed, if point x = 1 corresponds to position\n\u00fb on the sphere, and x = \u22121 to position \u2212\u00fb, then for\nx < cos \u03b3 the outcome will certainly be \u00fb, and \u2212\u00fb for\nx > cos \u03b3.\nAn elastic band that breaks in a single predetermined\npoint also constitutes an invasive experiment, altering the\nstate of the point-particle, but it does so in a perfectly\npredictable way (excluding of course the special case x =\ncos \u03b3). Let us call e\u00fb,x such a deterministic experiment.\nIf we envisage an experiment whose procedure consists\nin choosing randomly one of the e\u00fb,x , x \u2208 [\u22121, 1], then\nexecuting it (which means that x is considered to be a\nuniformly distributed random variable), then, again, we\ncan only predict the outcomes in probabilistic terms, and\nthe probabilities will be exactly given by (8) and (9).\nThis means that in the experiment e\u00fb (i.e., in the uniformly breaking elastic band) a collection of deterministic (potential) experiments e\u00fb,x are in fact \"hidden,\"\nand the way in which one of these hidden deterministic\nexperiments is selected during the measurement process\nis totally beyond the knowledge and possibility of control of the experimenter, as it depends on the presence\nof fluctuations in the experimental context.\nThis situation has been called hidden measurements,\nby analogy with so-called hidden variables theories,\nwhere the lack of knowledge is hypothesized being in relation to the state of the system. Now, in general terms,\none can show that if a theory describes a situation where\nthe lack of knowledge is about the state of the physical\nentity, then it is necessarily a classical statistical theory,\nobeying Kolmogorov's axioms. On the other hand, if\na theory describes a situation where the lack of knowledge is about the measurement to be actually performed,\nand such a measurement affects the state of the physical\nentity, then it is a non-classical statistical theory, violating classical Kolmogorov's axioms, as quantum theory\ndoes [8, 15].\nIn other terms, what the spin quantum-machine\nstrongly suggests, is that the fundamental difference between classical and quantum probabilities lies in the fact\nthat the former describes a situation of lack of knowledge about the state of the system, whereas the latter\ndescribes a situations where there is knowledge of the\nstate of the entity, but lack of knowledge about the interaction between the measurement apparatus and the\nentity.\nIntermediate systems. The spin quantum-machine is\nin fact a much richer model than what we have shown so\nfar. Indeed, it is very easy to modify its functioning to\nobtain probabilistic models that generalize the classical\nand quantum ones. To do this, Aerts considered a generalized class of experiments, employing elastics of a more\n\n\f6\ncomplex structure. Let us call them e\u00fb (\u000f), where \u000f is a\nreal parameter comprised between 0 and 1 (this modified\nspin quantum-machine model is then called \u000f-model [10]).\nAn e\u00fb (\u000f)-measurement has the same protocol of a e\u00fb measurement, but this time the elastic band used is not\nanymore uniformly breakable, but breakable only in a\nsegment of length 2\u000f around its center, and unbreakable\nin its lower and upper segments, as depicted in Fig. 2 (we\ndescribe here a simplified version of the model, which was\npresented in [7]).\n\nFIG. 2: A schematic representation of a e\u00fb (\u000f)-measurement,\nusing an elastic band that can only break in its central segment of length 2\u000f, whereas it is unbreakable in its lower and\nupper segments of length 21 \u2212 \u000f.\n\nTherefore, an e\u00fb (1)-experiment is a measurement using\na fully uniformly breaking elastic band [e\u00fb (1) = e\u00fb ] and\ncorresponds to the pure quantum situation where there\nis maximum lack of knowledge about the point where\nthe elastic is going to break. This is the situation described by the SQM, that we have previously analyzed,\nwhose probabilities are given by (8) and (9). On the\nother hand, an e\u00fb (0)-experiment is a measurement using an elastic band that breaks exactly in its middle,\nwith certainty [e\u00fb (0) = e\u00fb,0 ] and corresponds to a purely\nclassical (deterministic) situation with minimum lack of\nknowledge about the point where the elastic is going to\nbreak.\nBut what about a general e\u00fb (\u000f)-experiment, with 0 <\n\u000f < 1, i.e., an experiment using an elastic band which can\nonly (uniformly) break around its center, in a segment\nof length 2\u000f? The associated probabilities are easy to\ncalculate, and one has to distinguish the following three\ncases:\n(1) If the particle, when it \"falls\" orthogonally onto the\nelastic, lands on its upper unbreakable segment (v\u0302 * \u00fb =\ncos \u03b3 \u2265 \u000f), then:\n(\n1\n\u000f\n(11)\nP (v\u0302 \u2192 \u00b1\u00fb) =\n0,\n(2) If the particle, when it \"falls\" orthogonally onto the\nelastic, lands on its central uniformly breakable segment\nof length 2\u000f, (\u2212\u000f < cos \u03b3 < \u000f), then:\nP \u000f (v\u0302 \u2192 \u00b1\u00fb) =\n\n1\n(\u000f \u00b1 cos \u03b3).\n2\u000f\n\n(12)\n\n(3) If the particle, when it \"falls\" orthogonally onto the\nelastic, lands on its lower unbreakable segment (cos \u03b3 \u2264\n\u2212\u000f), then:\n(\n0\nP \u000f (v\u0302 \u2192 \u00b1\u00fb) =\n(13)\n1.\nTo what kind of situation do the above probabilities\ncorrespond? Do they correspond to a classical or to a\nquantum probability model? In fact, to none of them:\nthey don't fit into a classical Kolmogorovian probability\nmodel, but neither into a non-Kolmogorovian probability\nmodel of the quantum kind, as they truly correspond to\nnew intermediate models, describing more general structures, of which the classical and quantum ones are limit\ncases [8, 9, 17].\nWhat is interesting here to emphasize, in the general\nanalysis of the SQM model and of its \u000f-model generalization, is that our knowledge about the behavior of the\nphysical entity is clouded by the presence of fluctuations,\nwhose dynamics is beyond our control power. In the ambit of the \u000f-model the amplitude of these fluctuations\ncan be quantified by the real parameter \u000f \u2208 [0, 1]. When\n\u000f = 1, the fluctuations which are responsible for the dispersion in the results of the measurement are maximal, as\nis maximal our lack of knowledge about the experimental outcome. This corresponds to the limit case of a pure\nquantum system. However, when \u000f decreases, but is not\nzero, we are in a situation of intermediate knowledge: for\ncertain preparations of the physical system we can predict with certainty the outcome, whereas for others we\nare still in a situation where they can only be predicted\nin strict probabilistic terms.\nThen, when \u000f reaches its lower value zero, we can say\nthat the fluctuations in the measuring apparatus are in\na sense smaller than the scale of the physical entity, and\ntherefore cannot affect it in terms of outcomes (the different possible experiments that are randomly selected\nare not distinguishable in terms of their outcomes), so\nthat again we are in a situation of maximal knowledge,\ntypical of classical determinism.\nThe above scheme describes a possible approach to the\nsolution of the longstanding problem of finding a meaningful quantum-to-classical limit [18, 19], as it provides\nthe possibility of a continuous (non-singular) transition\nfrom these two limit situations.\nA last remark is due. Usually it is believed that macroscopic entities, like the ordinary entities with which we\ninteract daily, cannot exhibit quantum (or intermediate, quantum-like) behaviors. As the SQM model clearly\ndemonstrates, such a belief is unfounded. Of course, for\nthe reader it may be difficult to accept that a point particle on a sphere can also be considered a quantum entity.\nHowever, one should not forget that its quantum character is revealed when we perform on it certain experiments,\nand not others. We must not forget that the e\u00fb experiments are, in the SQM model, the only experiments that\nwe are allowed, by definition, to execute.\n\n\f7\nWe are not allowed to \"see\" the point particle by other\nmeans, and this is the reason why, considering this restriction, the point particle can behave as a quantum entity. As Aerts and Durt emphasize [18]: \"This is indeed\nexactly the situation that we encounter when we make investigations about quantum entities in the micro-world.\nWe cannot 'see' or 'touch' these entities, and have only\nknowledge about them by means of the experiments that\nwe can carry out on them.\"\nIII.\n\nA CLASSICAL MACROSCOPIC ENTITY\nVIOLATING BELL'S INEQUALITY\nA.\n\nBell's inequality\n\nBefore describing (our alternative version, based on\nelastics, of) Aerts' connected vessels of water model [13,\n14, 23], let us briefly recall what Bell's inequality is all\nabout [25, 26]. Bell was able to translate into a mathematical inequality certain general assumptions about\nphysical systems, so that if these equalities are found to\nbe experimentally violated, then at least one of the assumptions that are used to derive them must be wrong.\nWe shall not prove here Bell's inequality, but simply recall its expression.\nAssume that, on a given physical entity, four different\nA\nexperiments can be performed.

The spin filters, which can be independently oriented along different directions, can detect \"up\" and \"down\" spin components, by\nletting for instance pass the \"up\" spin components and stopping the \"down\" spin components.\n\nIn this ambit, one can conceive the following four ex2\n2\n2\nA\nB\nperiments: eA\na \u2261 ~ S\u00e2 \u2297 I, ea0 \u2261 ~ S\u00e20 \u2297 I, eb \u2261 I \u2297 ~ Sb\u0302\n2\nB\n0\n0\nand eb0 \u2261 I \u2297 ~ Sb\u03020 , where \u00e2, \u00e2 , b\u0302 and b\u0302 are unit vectors\ndescribing the orientations of the Stern-Gerlach filters\n(orthogonal to the direction of flight of the pair of quantum entities forming the singlet state), I is the identity\noperator, \u2297 is the tensor product, and the symbol \u2261 is to\nbe interpreted as \"the experiment on the left hand side\ncorresponds to the measuring of the observable on the\nright hand side.\"\nThese experiments (that can take values +1 or \u22121) can\nbe combined to define the coincidence experiments:\neAB\ncd \u2261\n\n4\nS\u0109 \u2297 Sd\u02c6,\n~2\n\n(17)\n\nwhere \u0109 \u2208 {\u00e2, \u00e20 }, d\u02c6 \u2208 {b\u0302, b\u03020 }.\nNow, considering the quantum mechanical expectation\nAB\nvalue Ecd\n= h\u03c8S | ~42 S\u0109 \u2297Sd\u02c6|\u03c8S i, and using the properties\nof the spin operators (see any good book of quantum\nAB\n\u02c6 Therefore,\nmechanics), one can show that Ecd\n= \u2212\u0109 * d.\n0\n0\nif one takes \u00e2, \u00e2 , b\u0302 and b\u0302 to be coplanar and choose the\nangles between \u00e2 and b\u0302, b\u0302 and \u00e20 , and between \u00e20 and b\u03020\n\n\f8\nto be equal to \u03c0/4, one obtains:\nAB\nAB\nAB\nAB\n|Eab\n\u2212 Eab\n0 | + |Ea0 b0 + Ea0 b | =\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a !\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2\n2\n2\n2\n+ \u2212\n= 2 2, (18)\n\u2212\n+ \u2212\n\u2212\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\nwhich is clearly a violation of (15).\nThis result shows that no physical theory which is local in the sense specified by Bell, can agree with all the\nstatistical implications of quantum mechanics. Bell locality hypothesis can be understood as an assumption\nabout the experimental separation of the two (here spin)\nentities emerging from the source and which, after an arbitrary long time of flight, are detectable in two regions\nA and B that are spatially separated by an arbitrarily\nlarge distance.\nIn accordance with Einstein's view, the assumption of\nmany physicists was that a spatial separation would also\nimply an experimental separation, so that the expectations were that the microphysical reality would obey\nBell's inequality. But these expectations were disregarded, as we today all know, by the historical experiments with entangled pairs of Aspect et al. [27, 28] (who\nconsidered the equivalent situation of photons' polarization measurements, instead of spin measurements), and\nthe many others that since then followed, who confirmed\nthe reality of the violation (18), and therefore the correctness of the quantum formalism describing entangled\nstates.\nIn other terms, we have to renounce to local realism\n\"\u00e0 la Bell\" in the description of the microworld. But,\nhow can we understand then the origin of the violation\nof Bell's inequality and, can they be violated only by\nmicroscopic quantum entities? As we shall see in the\nnext section, Bell's inequality is easily violated also by\nmacroscopic 'classical' entities, provided we experiment\non them in a very specific way. This will offer us the\nopportunity to see what exactly happens when a definite\nvalue of a property of the system in region A is acquired\nby virtue of a measurement carried out in region B, and\nvice versa.\n\nB.\n\nAn elastic band violating Bell's inequality\n\nLet us now describe a macroscopic entity that can\nmaximally violate Bell's inequality (15). As we have\nmentioned in the Introduction, Aerts considered a system made of vessels of water connected by tubes and\nsiphons [13, 14, 23]. Here we shall present a much simpler\nsystem, which can play the same role as the connected\nvessels: a single uniform elastic band.[47]\nWe assume that the uniform elastic band has been\nmade with a red rubber and that when unstreched, its\nlength is L. Two scientists are placed at the two ends\nof it (let us call them A and B, respectively), and can\nperform certain experiments. Scientist A can perform on\n\nthe left end of the elastic band two experiments, eA\na and\neA\n,\nwhich\nare\ndefined\nas\nfollow.\n0\na\nExperiment eA\na consists in grabbing the end of the elastic band and pulling it with force, then measuring the\nlength of the unstreched elastic band that has been collected in this way: if it is greater than L/2, the outcome\nA\nA\noA\na = +1, otherwise oa = \u22121. Experiment ea0 is much\nsimpler as it consists in simply looking at the elastic band\nand checking whether its color is red. If it is so, then the\nA\noutcome oA\na0 = +1, otherwise oa0 = \u22121. Scientist B can\nperform the same experiments as scientist A, but on the\nright end of the uniform elastic band. In other terms, eB\nb\nB\nB\nis defined as eB\na and eb0 as ea0 (see the schematic representation of Fig. 4).\n\nelastic band of length L\n\nFIG. 4: A schematic representation of the experiments that\nscientists A and B can perform on the two distant ends of the\nelastic band entity, simultaneously or not, using their hands\nand eyes.\n\nOf course, since the elastic band is made with a red\nrubber and its length is L, all of the four above mentioned\nexperiments, when performed individually, can only produce the outcome +1 (as is clear that when only one\nexperimenter is pulling the elastic, the whole of it will\ncome in her/his hands). The same remains obviously true\nAB\nAB\nwhen the coincidence experiments eAB\nab0 , ea0 b and ea0 b0 are\nperformed at the same time by the two scientists, whose\noutcomes are always (+1, +1) (we observe that when the\nelastic is pulled by one of the experimenters, the other\none still has the possibility to locally check its color, as\nis clear that the light coming from the elastic is always\navailable to be detected at her/his location).\nThe situation changes however when one considers the\ncoincidence experiment eAB\nab , which creates correlations.\nIndeed, if the two scientists grab and pull the elastic band\nat the same time, it will break in some unpredictable\npoint, so that if one scientist collects a fragment of length\ngreater than L/2, the other one will necessarily collect\na fragment of length lower than L/2. Thus, the only\npossible outcomes of the coincidence experiment eAB\nab are\n(+1, \u22121) and (\u22121, +1), and of course they have the same\nprobability to occur, which is equal to 1/2.\nAB\nAccording to (14), we therefore obtain that Eab\n=\n0\nAB\nAB\nAB\nEa0 b = Ea0 b0 = 1, and Eab = \u22121, so that:\nAB\nAB\nAB\nAB\n|Eab\n\u2212 Eab\n0 | + |Ea0 b0 + Ea0 b | =\n|\u22121 \u2212 (+1)| + |+1 + (+1)| = 4.\n\n(19)\n\nIn other terms, not only the elastic band can be used\nto break Bell's inequality, but it can do it much more\n\n\f9\nthan the typical example of two coupled spin-1/2 entities\nin a singlet state.\n\nC.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn [29] David Mermin mentions a conversation with a\ndistinguished physicist in Princeton. He asked him how\nhe thought Einstein would have reacted to the violation\nof Bell's inequalities: \"He said that Einstein would have\ngone home and thought about it hard for several weeks\nthat he couldn't guess what he would then have said,\nexcept that it would have been extremely interesting.\"\nThis author likes to think that Einstein might have\ntried to find out an example \"\u00e0 la Aerts,\" like his connected vessels model, or the equivalent elastic band model\nthat we have described. And based on an example of this\nkind, he would have probably reached the same conclusions as Aerts did, regarding the real mystery hidden in\nBell's inequalities (a.k.a. Bell's no-go theorem).\nWhat's immediately evident in the elastic band model\nis the fact that the entity playing the role of the quantum singlet state \u2013 the uniform elastic band \u2013 is a single\ngenuine whole entity, and not two entities, and certainly\ncannot be understood as the sum of two separated interacting parts, each one described by its own specific\nstate.\nIndeed, the elastic band is present not only in the two\nregions A and B, where the two scientists are located\n(close to its ends), but also in between these two regions: it possesses what has been called the property of\nmacroscopic wholeness [13], i.e., the property of hanging\ntogether through space, which means it cannot be localized in different macroscopically separated spatial regions\nwithout also being localized somewhere in the region 'in\nbetween' them.\nThis wholeness aspect was already pointed out by\nSchroedinger [31], when he emphasized that entangled\nstates like (16) are associated to a notion of nonseparability, in the sense that two quantum entities can\nfind each other in a state such that only the properties\nof the pair appear to be defined, whereas the individual properties of each one of the two entities that have\nformed the pair remain totally undefined [48].\nClearly, the notion of non-separability introduced by\nSchroedinger becomes fully explicit and viewable with\nthe elastic band example. Indeed, one can certainly confer well defined properties to the two distant ends of the\nunbroken elastic band, like their spatial distance, but on\nthe other hand we cannot attribute to each of these distant ends, considered \"separately,\" well-defined properties, as they don't possess any independent reality outside\nof the reality of the whole band.\nBut when the coincidence experiment eAB\nab is executed,\nsomething very special happens: two entities are created\nand correlations that weren't present before the experiment are in this way actualized. This creation of correlations, that can violate Bell's locality hypothesis (and\n\ntherefore Bell's inequality), cannot be described in terms\nof local hidden variables, associated to the individual\nstates of the (only potentially existing) separated fragments of the elastic band, as the correlations are produced by the measurement process itself, which in the\npresent case is a hidden measurement process.\nAs we observed for the SQM model, a hidden measurement process is a process characterized by two ingredients: (1) an aspect of creation of new properties and (2)\nan aspect of indeterminism, i.e., the fact that the outcome of such a creation process cannot be predicted in\nadvance. Therefore, a natural question arises: is it the\ncreation of correlations that were inexistent before the\nexperiment that is responsible for the violation of Bell's\ninequality, or is it the indeterminism that is inherent in\nthis process, or is it both?\nThis question was deeply analyzed in [23], using a\nmuch more complex macroscopic model than the elastic\nband model presented here, able to violate Bell's inequality not in a maximal way, but exactly in the same way a\nquantum singlet state does [32]. By varying in the model\ntwo parameters, quantifying respectively the degree of\ncorrelation and of indeterminism present in the system,\nthe authors were able to show that the crucial ingredient\nin the violation of Bell's inequality is not the indeterminism, but the correlation, i.e., that it is the non-local\naspect expressed by the correlation that is the true source\nof the violation, and that the presence of indeterminism\ncan in fact decrease the value Bell's inequality takes.\nWithout engaging in the rather involved analysis of\nthe more complex situation presented in [23], let us however show, in our simpler elastic band model, how Bell's\ninequality can be violated even when all source of indeterminism in the experiments has been eliminated.\nTo do this, we simply have to replace the hidden measurement promoted by the uniform elastic band, by a\n\"pure\" (non-hidden) measurement promoted by a (red)\nelastic band that can only break (if the elastic is stretched\nwith sufficient force) in a predetermined point, located,\nsay, at distance L/3 from its left end.\nThen, the outcomes of the coincidence experiments\nAB\nAB\neAB\nab0 , ea0 b and ea0 b0 will be again (+1, +1), as it was the\ncase for the uniform elastic band (scientists cannot break\nthe elastic if they pull it only from one end). On the\nother hand, concerning experiment eAB\nab , the only difference is that now we can predict in advance what will be\nthe outcome, meaning that the correlation is created in\na perfectly deterministic way, always producing the outcome (\u22121, +1).\nHence, as for the uniform elastic band, we find that\nAB\nAB\nAB\nAB\nEab\n= \u22121, so that (19)\n0 = Ea0 b = Ea0 b0 = 1, and Eab\nholds and Bell's inequality is again maximally violated.\nThis shows that it is the creation of correlations which\nis really responsible for the violation, and not its deterministic or indeterministic character.\nCorrelations that were not present before the experiment, but are created by and during it, are called correlations of the second kind [13]. This to distinguish them\n\n\f10\nfrom so-called correlations of the first kind, which are already present before the experiment is executed, and are\ntherefore not created but only discovered by it.\nLet us observe that although in the elastic experiment\nthe correlation (of the second kind) is created instantly, in\nthe precise moment when elastic breaks, the information\nrelative to the correlation cannot travel faster than the\nspeed of contraction of the elastic. In other terms, the\nelastic can't be used to produce superluminal signaling\nand Einstein locality is obviously preserved. [49]\nLet us also observe that, as explained in [13], one cannot use correlations of the first kind to violate Bell's inequality. Let us show this explicitly in our model by\nreplacing the whole elastic entity by an already broken\nelastic entity, where the left fragment is, say, of length\nL/3 and the right fragment of length 2L/3 (see Fig. 5).\n\nbroken elastic band of length L\n\nFIG. 5: A schematic representation of the experiments that\nscientists A and B can perform on the two distant ends of\nan already broken elastic band entity, simultaneously or not,\nusing their hands and eyes.\n\nClearly, the respective lengths of the two elastic fragments are correlated, as is clear that their sum must be\nequal to the total length L of the (previously) unbroken\nelastic band. However, this correlation is now of the first\nkind, as it is already present in the system before the\nexperiments are carried out.\nAlso in this case, the outcomes of all the experiments\nare predetermined, as it was the case for the (unbroken)\nelastic band only breakable in one point, and we have\nAB\nthat the outcomes of eAB\na0 b and ea0 b0 are (+1, +1), and\nAB\nthe outcome of eab is (\u22121, +1). On the other hand,\nthis time experiment eAB\nab0 has outcome (\u22121, +1), so that\nAB\nAB\nAB\nEaAB\n= Eab\n0 b = Ea0 b0 = 1, and Eab\n0 = \u22121, yielding:\nAB\nAB\nAB\nAB\n|Eab\n\u2212 Eab\n0 | + |Ea0 b0 + Ea0 b | =\n|\u22121 \u2212 (\u22121)| + |+1 + (+1)| = 2,\n\n(20)\n\nin plain accordance with Bell's inequality (15).\nWe can therefore conclude with Aerts that [13]: \"The\nviolation of Bell inequalities is not a property of microentities. Bell inequalities can equally well be violated\nby coincidence experiments on classical microscopic entity. In fact Bell inequalities can always be violated if\nduring the coincidence experiments one breaks one entity into separated pieces, and by this act creates the\ncorrelations.\"\nWe call attention to the fact that, because of its connectedness, a whole elastic band is the expression of a\nnumber of relations between its different parts. Each\npoint of the elastic is indeed representative of a specific\n\nrelation between the two non-separated parts of the elastic which are on the left and right sides of the point (the\nrelation being expressed by the fact that the sum of the\nunstreched lengths of these two parts has to be L).\nHence, one may be tempted to conclude that the violation of Bell's inequality is in fact the result of correlations of the first kind, between non-separated parts,\nand not of correlations of the second kind, between separated fragments. This however would be a wrong conclusion, as only correlations between separated fragments\nare observed during the experiments, and these correlations are literally created by them. Indeed, the nonseparated parts of an unbroken elastic band only correspond to potential separated fragments, and therefore to\npotential correlations, when considered in relation to the\noutcomes of the experiments. [50]\nThis remark is important in order to understand that\nentangled states, like singlet states, are the expression of\na (hidden) connected structure of relations out of which\ncorrelations between outcomes are created, not discovered. This is so because the properties which are observed during the coincidence experiments do not exist\nprior to them, but are actualized by them, in the same\nway as separated fragments do not exist until the whole\nelastic is broken.\nThis mechanism of creation of correlations is already\nmanifest in the quantum formalism, as is clear that the\nsinglet state is a state of zero spin, which is rotational\ninvariant, so that there is nothing special about the direction \u00fb we have chosen to represent the state in terms\nof \"up\" and \"down\" components: if one chooses another\narbitrary direction, say \u0175, then by a direct algebraic calculation one can show that (16) can be equivalently written as:\n\u0001\n1\nB\nA\nB\n|\u03c8S i \u221d \u221a |+iA\n\u0175 \u2297 |\u2212i\u0175 \u2212 |\u2212i\u0175 \u2297 |+i\u0175 ,\n2\n\n(21)\n\nThis means that the correlation between the outcomes of the left (region A) and right (region B) spinmeasurements doesn't depend on the global orientation\nchosen for the two spin filters (only their relative orientation is important), and this also means that |\u03c8S i doesn't\ndescribe the state of two-entities having already actualized their spin, although the way it is mathematically\nwritten may wrongly suggest so.\nIn fact, their spins are literally created by the coincidence experiment, which in a sense \"breaks\" the singlet\nstate into a state describing two separated spin entities\nwith a specific direction (although now entangled with\nthe experimental apparatus), exactly in the same way an\nelastic band of length L doesn't describe two actually separated elastic bands, but only two potentially separated\nelastic bands, which can be created (in a deterministic or\nindeterministic way) by performing a correlation experiment of the breaking kind.\n\n\f11\nIV.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nLet us briefly summarize the main results we have presented in this paper. To understand what could possibly\nhappen \"behind the scenes,\" during a quantum measurement, we have reviewed two of Aerts' macroscopic models: the SQM (and its \u000f-model generalization) [10, 11],\nand an elastic band model inspired by a previous connected vessels of water model [13, 14, 23].\nIn this way, we have gained considerable insight into\nthe functioning of the quantum level of our reality, which\ntherefore appears to be less mysterious than expected,\nconsidering that also ordinary macroscopic entities can\ngive rise to quantum probabilities, or violate Bell's inequalities, and that the way they do it is perfectly under\nour eyes.\nMore precisely, thanks to the SQM model, and the\nstructural analogies it provides, we have explained the\nemergence of quantum probabilities in terms of hidden,\ninvasive measurements, which are selected in a way that\ncannot be controlled and therefore predicted by the experimenter.\nThis of course doesn't mean that we now understand\neverything about quantum measurements, which surely\nretain part of their mystery. Indeed, the SQM model just\ntells us in what direction one should search, but not what\nexactly to find: we have to search not for hidden variables\nassociated to the state of the entity, as it has been historically done, but for hidden variables associated to the\nmeasurement process, i.e., for the \"pure\" (possibly deterministic) measurement interactions which are selected\nthrough a (symmetry breaking) mechanism that cannot\nbe controlled (and therefore be known) by the experimenter.\nWith regard to the nature of these hidden measurements, as far as the present author can judge, the mystery\nremains intact. Of course, there exist unconventional\napproaches to quantum mechanics where some attempts\nhave been made to identify possible (real) processes that\nwould operate at a subquantum level, and that could\npossibly explain the emergence of quantum probabilities.\nSince we have quoted John Cramer in the Introduction, let us mention, as a simple paradigmatic example, his transactional interpretation (TI) [1], which has\nbeen recently revisited by Ruth Kastner [33]. TI is a\ntime-symmetric re-interpretation of conventional quantum mechanics, such that kets are associated to retarded\n\"offer waves of possibilities,\" evolving forward in time,\nemitted by entities which, in a given context, play the\nrole of sources, whereas bras are associated to advanced\n\"confirmation waves of possibilities,\" evolving backward\nin time, emitted by entities playing the role of absorbers,\nin response to the offers received from the sources. These\na-temporal offer-confirmation exchanges between sources\nand potential absorbers, give rise to so-called incipient\ntransactions, which are then selected (through a symmetry breaking mechanism) to give rise to actualized transactions, i.e., to processes that select specific outcomes in\n\nthe form of actual transfers of given quanta of energy and\nmomentum.\nIt is not our intention to enter here into the details\nof the TI and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of\nthis rather unusual interpretation. Our only intention\nwas to provide a very simple example of an approach\nwhose ontology contemplates a candidate for something\nlike a hidden measurement interaction, which in the TI\ncase would correspond to the process of actualization of\nincipient transactions.\nRegarding the hidden-measurement approach, some\nreaders may be tempted to believe that, because of the\nwell-known Gleason's theorem [20] and Kochen-Specker's\nimpossibility proof [21], it would be unfeasible to construct models like the SQM, for Hilbert spaces of dimension greater than 2. This is however not the case, as NoGo theorems for hidden variables only apply to models\nwith hidden variables referring to the state of the system, and not to models where the hidden variables refer\ninstead to the measurement process (see the discussion\nin [22] and the references cited therein).\nIn other terms, although one could consider, in light\nof the above results, that the SQM model would not per\nse be sufficient to possibly explain the origin of quantum\nprobabilities, one should bear in mind that its built-in\nhidden-measurement mechanism can be easily generalized to describe the probability model of quantum systems of arbitrary dimension, as it was done by Aerts\nin [8]. A discussion of these more general situations would\nhowever go beyond the scope of the present paper, and\nwe refer the interested readers to [6\u20139, 22], and the references therein.\nLet us now comment on the second part of the present\npaper: the violation of Bell's inequalities. Thanks to the\nelastic band model, we can easily affirm that much of the\nstrangeness associated to these phenomena, which disturbed so much Einstein, Schroedinger, Bell and many\nothers, is gone. Indeed, it is possible to explain quantum correlations, the \"spooky actions at a distance,\" as\nEinstein used to call them, as processes during which a\nwhole entity is broken into parts, in a deterministic or\nindeterministic way.\nAgain, this doesn't mean we now understand everything about the quantum correlations produced by entangled states. Indeed, as we explained, for a macroscopic entity to be able to violate Bell's inequality, the\nconditio sine qua non is that it possesses the property of\nmacroscopic wholeness: it has to be present in the spatially separated regions A and B, where the coincidence\nexperiments are performed, but it has also to be present\nin the region between them.\nBut quantum microscopic entities do not possess this\nmacroscopic wholeness property, and this certainly constitutes that part of the mystery that remains intact\nwhen considering the violation of Bell's inequality at the\nmicroscopic level, in EPR-like experiments. Indeed, considering a singlet state formed from a pair of electrons\nthat have flown apart, and have reached the distant re-\n\n\f12\ngions A and B, respectively, we know that one electron\ncan be detected with probability close to one in region A,\nand same for the other electron in region B, but that the\nprobability of detecting them in between is almost zero.\nSo, it seems that at the microscopic level, spatially separated entities can nevertheless remain interconnected,\nnot through space, but in some other, yet to be explained,\nway.\nOf course, the difficulty many physicists experience in\ntruly understanding this possibility lies once more in the\ndifficulty one might have in visualizing a concrete model\nthat would render it manifest. This however is not unfeasible. A possibility has been proposed in [36], where\na generalization of the concept of macroscopic wholeness\nwas proposed, called process-macroscopic wholeness, expressing the idea that two entities can remain connected\nnot only through space, in a static way, but also through\ntime, in a more dynamic way.\nThese kind of explanations force us to abandon an old\npreconception, which may be the one truly hindering our\nunderstanding of the microworld: that microscopic entities should always be present in our three-dimensional\nspace and that, more generally, reality should only exist\nwithin space. On the contrary, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that microscopic entities are non-spatial entities, and that, quoting Aerts, space would only be [6]\"[...]\na momentaneous crystallization of a theatre for reality\nwhere the motions and interactions of the macroscopic\nmaterial and energetic entities take place. But other entities - like quantum entities for example - 'take place'\noutside space, or - and this would be another way of saying the same thing - within a space that is not the three\ndimensional Euclidean space.\"\nClearly, we cannot enter here in the analysis of these\nimportant ideas (for more details, see for instance [6, 10,\n13, 36\u201338] and the references cited therein), as this would\nbring us too far away from the primary motivation of\nthis paper, which was only to conceptually review two\nof Aerts' historical machine-models, in order to promote\na deeper understanding of the physical content \"hidden\"\nwithin the abstract quantum formalism. It is worth emphasizing that the truly interesting aspect about these\nmodels is not their ability to realistically describe physical entities as such, but to capture, by means of powerful structural analogies, the possible logic at the basis of\ntheir functioning, when they interact with the different\nexperimental contexts.\nAlso, these machine-models force us to abandon too\nsimplistic distinctions about classical and quantum entities. Indeed, the quantum behavior of a physical entity\nappears to also depend on how we choose to actively experimenting on it, according to specific protocols. And\nthis is the reason why also macroscopic ordinary entities\ncan behave in a quantum-like fashion. This remark has\nsome relevance also in relation to possible loopholes in\nexperiments testing Bell's inequality, where by loophole\nwe mean here a more or less consciously used assumption\nwhich would undermine the validity of an experiment (see\n\nfor instance [41], pages 600-605).\nThe analysis here presented highlights one of these possible loophole: the (wrong) assumption that Bell's inequality could only be violated by microscopic systems\nand that the violation would be an indication of the presence of only microscopic quantum properties. On the\ncontrary, we know that, quoting once more Aerts, [23]\n\"Bell inequalities can be genuinely violated in situations\nthat do not pertain to the microworld. Of course, this\ndoes not decrease the peculiarity of the quantum mechanical violation in the EPRB experiment. What it does,\nis shed light on the possible underlying mechanisms and\nprovide evidence that the phenomenon is much more general than has been assumed.\"\nIn other words, also the detecting apparatus, in a typical coincidence experiment, when considered as an interconnected macroscopic whole entity, is in principle able\nto produce correlations of the second kind, which could\nbe in principle at the origin of the observed violation of\nBell's inequality. This possibility is sometimes called the\n\"locality loophole.\" [41] To close this loophole, one has\nto design the coincidence experiments in such a way to\nbe sure that only the correlations originating from the\nentangled microscopic entity are at the origin of the violation of Bell's inequality.\nFor this, one has to exploit the fact that, because of\nthe non-spatial nature of microscopic entities, the effects resulting from the creation of correlations by entangled states \"travel\" virtually instantaneously (certainly\nthousands of times faster than the light speed [43], although this cannot be used to produce superluminal signaling [44]), whereas possible effects due to correlations\nresulting from the interconnectedness of the detectors\ncertainly cannot be communicated at speeds greater than\nthe speed of light.\nThis was done by Aspect, in his famous polarization\nexperiments with entangled photons (see [27, 28] and the\nreferences therein), where the choice of orientations of the\npolarizers were changed randomly in very short times,\nduring the flight of the two entangled photons, in order\nto dramatically enforce relativistic separation. Thanks to\nthese experiments, it was possible to conclude, quoting\nAspect, [28] \"[...] that an entangled EPR photon pair is\na non-separable object; that is, it is impossible to assign\nindividual local properties (local physical reality) to each\nphoton. In some sense, both photons keep in contact\nthrough space and time.\"\nTo conclude, we point out that many other machine\nmodels have been invented in addition to those mentioned in this article, and we can only invite the reader\nto take cognizance of them, to get advantage of the\nnumerous insights they are able to promote. Let us\nmention Aerts' model describing subsystems connected\nby rigid rods, which can violate Bell's inequalities in a\nnon-maximal way, as microscopic quantum entities can\ndo [23, 35], also revealing possible unexpected interpretations of mixed states in the standard quantum formalism [34]. And let us also mention a recent model that\n\n\f13\nhas been presented by this author, called the \u03b4-quantum\nmachine, which is able to replicate the scattering probabilities of a one-dimensional quantum scattering process\nby a Dirac delta-function potential.\nBut Aerts, in his attempt to truly understand quantum mechanics, has not only invented mechanistic models. In more recent years he has also devoted a considerable effort in using the quantum mechanical formalism\nto model, with great success, human conceptual situations as they appear in cognition, decision theory and\neconomics. This led him to ask a deep and thought provoking question [39]: \"If quantum mechanics as a formalism models human concepts so well, perhaps this indicates that quantum particles themselves are conceptual\nentities?\"\nThis question was the starting point of a new interpretation of quantum mechanics, which is probably today's most advanced explanatory framework to understand this puzzling theory. According to Aerts, quantum\nentities would [39] \"[...] interact with ordinary matter,\nnuclei, atoms, molecules, macroscopic material entities,\nmeasuring apparatus, ..., in a similar way to how human concepts interact with memory structures, human\nminds or artificial memories.\" Therefore, quoting again\nAerts [39]: \"if proven correct, this new quantum interpretation would provide an explanation according to which\n\n'quantum particles' behave like something we are all very\nfamiliar with, and have direct experience with, namely\nconcepts.\"\nWe will certainly not comment any further this subtle explanatory framework and its effectiveness in truly\nexplaining phenomena such as entanglement and nonlocality, which are traditionally considered (in the spirit\nof Feynman's quote cited in the Introduction) as \"not understood,\" and leave to the reader the intellectual pleasure to directly discover them in Aerts' recently published\narticles [39, 40]. Let us just observe that it is rather remarkable that what is probably the best available model\nto understand the mysteries of the quantum level of our\nreality has always been at hand, hidden in the very structure of our cognitive processes.\n\n[1] J.

Indeed, Aerts' quantum machines are conventional objects, whose quantum\nbehavior is not a consequence of their internal coherence,\nbut of the structure of the possibilities of actively experimenting with them, as a consequence of the peculiarities\nof the chosen experimental protocols.\nQuantum probabilities are non-Komogorovian in the\nsense that they do not obey the basic axioms of classical\nprobability theory, named after Andrey Kolmogorov [42].\nIn particular, they violate the so-called additivity axiom,\nas a consequence of the fact that in quantum mechanics\none adds probability amplitudes, rather than the probabilities themselves.\nA very similar elastic band-system has also been utilized\nby Sven Aerts to obtain a realistic simulation of a socalled non-local PR box without communication. [30]\nIn fact, and quite surprisingly, it is not the notion of nonseparability that creates difficulty in quantum mechanics,\nbut rather the notion of separability. In this regard, it\nis worth mentioning that the experimental violation of\nBell's inequality didn't provide a solution of the EPR\nparadox per se. Such a solution only became possible in\nthe eighties, following Aerts' deep analysis of the EPR\nsituation, which he presented in his Doctoral Thesis and\nthen further developed in a number of publications. In\nthese works, he pointed out a very subtle and crucial\npoint: that standard quantum mechanics is in fact unable, structurally speaking, to describe systems made of\nseparated entities [14] (the concept of separation is here\nto be understood in the experimental sense, i.e., in the\nsense that performing experiments on one of the entities\ndoesn't affect the state of the others, and vice versa). As\nstressed by Aerts, this is a fundamental (and usually misunderstood) point, as EPR, in their (ex-absurdum) reasoning, precisely assumed, on the contrary, that quantum\nmechanics was perfectly able to describe the situation of\ntwo entities that become separated (in the experimental\nsense) as they fly apart in space. But this premise was\n\n\f15\nproven by Aerts' analysis to be false. So, although EPR\nconclusion about the incompleteness of quantum mechanics was correct, it wasn't for the reasons advocated in\ntheir 1935 paper. If quantum mechanics is incomplete,\nit is because it fails to correctly describe experimentally\nseparated physical entities [14].\n[49] This of course could also be considered as a weakness of\nthe elastic-model, as is clear that it cannot simulate an\ninstantaneous co-creation of information by the two experimenters, as it appears to happen instead in Aspect's\nexperiments with entangled photons. But being the connection between entangled microscopic entities of a nonspatial nature (see the discussion in the last section of this\npaper), the times and ways through which the co-created\ninformation reaches the two experimenters needs not be\nlimited by relativistic constraints, as is the case instead\nfor macroscopic entities like an elastic band. Also, let us\n\nnot forget that the most interesting aspect of the model is\nnot its ability to perfectly simulate a specific microscopic\nquantum system, but to show that simple physical systems exist which are able to create correlations without\ncommunication, thus violating Bell's inequality (see also\nthe discussion in [30]).\n[50] To make this point even clearer, consider holding a die.\nAll its six faces exist, but only when the die is rolled an\nupper face is created by the \"rolling experiment.\" If we\nstick together two dice, we obtain a connected structure,\nexhibiting specific relations between the different faces\nof the double-die. All these relations exist, but it is only\nwhen the double-die is rolled that a specific couple of correlated upper faces is created, a process which therefore\nhas to be understood as a correlation of the second kind.\n\n\f"}
