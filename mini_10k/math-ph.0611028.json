This provides by itself sufficient reason to study degenerate\nClifford algebras and related structures in differential geometry.\nFrom physics point of view too this is an interesting but a neglected\nsubject. It is well-known that Newton's non-relativistic theory of gravitation\nmay be given a locally Galilei covariant formulation over a 4-dimensional\nspace-time equipped with independent space and time metrics that are both\ndegenerate. A Newton-Cartan manifold is a space-time that admits a linear\nconnection compatible with both space and time metrics.\nIn what follows, the degenerate Clifford algebra Cl1,0,3 is defined over a\n4-dimensional Newton-Cartan manifold. The corresponding degenerate spin\ngroup SP IN(1, 0, 3) is defined. The Newton-Cartan connection is lifted to\nthe degenerate spinor bundle. This allows one to write down the L\u00e8vyLeblond equation satisfied by a non-relativistic spin-1/2 electron directly,\nthus coupling it to gravity.\n\n2\n\nGalilei Group and Degenerate Spin Group\n\nLet h, i be a symmetric bilinear form on Rn and let us consider the subspace\nW of Rn\nW = {w \u2208 Rn | hw, xi = 0 for all x \u2208 Rn }.\nW is called the radical and the dimension of W is called the co-rank of h, i.\nIf co-rank is zero/non-zero, then h, i is called non-degenerate/degenerate. If\nW \u2032 \u2282 Rn is any complementary subspace to W , then the restriction of h, i\nto W \u2032 is non-degenerate [1]. If the co-rank of h, i is r and the the restriction\nof h, i to W \u2032 has signature (p, q) (in the sense that W \u2032 can be decomposed as\nW \u2032\u2032 \u2295 W \u2032\u2032\u2032 , where the dimension of W \u2032\u2032 respectively W \u2032\u2032\u2032 are p resp. q and the\nrestriction of h, i to W \u2032\u2032 resp. W \u2032\u2032\u2032 is negative resp. positive definite), then\nthe pair (Rn , h, i) is said to be of type Rr,p,q . In this terminology, R0,1,3 is\ncalled relativistic space-time and R1,0,3 is called non-relativistic space-time.\nWe will consider throughout the non-relativistic R1,0,3 . Let the radical\nbe spanned by the vector f and let {e1 , e2 , e3 } be an orthonormal basis for\na complementary W \u2032 . Then, obviously, the set {f, e1 , e2 , e3 } becomes a basis\nfor R1,0,3 .\n1\n\n\fIn a non-relativistic space-time, the set of linear-automorphisms \u03c6 from\nR\nto R1,0,3 is called the Galilei group if h\u03c6(v), \u03c6(w)i = hv, wi for all\nv, w \u2208 R1,0,3 , det(\u03c6) = 1 and \u03c6 |W = id . Thus the Galilei group can be\nwritten as\n1,0,3\n\nSO(1, 0, 3) = {\u03c6 \u2208 Aut(R1,0,3 ) | h\u03c6(v), \u03c6(w)i = hv, wi, det(\u03c6) = 1, \u03c6|W = id}.\nUsing the matrix of \u03c6 denoted by \u03a6 with respect to the basis {f, e1 , e2 , e3 },\nwe can write\nSO(1, 0, 3) = {\u03a6 \u2208 Mat(4 \u00d7 4) | \u03a6t G\u03a6 = G, det(\u03a6) = 1, \u03a6 |sp{f } = I}\nwhere W = sp{f } = {\u03bbf | \u03bb \u2208 R} and\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0\n0\nG=\n.\n0\nI3\u00d73\nFrom the above equations we obtain that SO(1, 0, 3) can be parameterized\nas\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 A\n| R \u2208 SO(3) A \u2208 Mat(1 \u00d7 3)}.\nSO(1, 0, 3) = {\n0 R\nMoreover SO(1, 0, 3) is also isomorphic to the semi-direct product of\nSO(3) and Mat(3 \u00d7 1)\nSO(1, 0, 3) \u2243 SO(3) \u22c9id Mat(3 \u00d7 1).\nLet Cl1,0,3 be the degenerate Clifford algebra of R1,0,3 . Degenerate spin\ngroup is defined to be a special subset of Cl1,0,3\nSP IN(1, 0, 3) = {s(1 + vf ) | s \u2208 SP IN(3), v \u2208 W \u2032 = sp{e1 , e2 , e3 }}\nwhere SP IN(3) is taken as the spin group lying in the Clifford algebra on W \u2032 ,\nCl(W \u2032 ) \u2282 Cl1,0,3 . We can regard SP IN(3) as a subspace of SP IN(1, 0, 3)\ntaking v = 0. (For the general SP IN(r, p, q) see [2])\nSP IN(1, 0, 3) is indeed a group under the Clifford multiplication. Let\nus first see that the Clifford multiplication on SP IN(1, 0, 3) is a binaryoperation:\ns(1 + vf )s\u2032 (1 + v \u2032 f ) = (s + svf )(s\u2032 + s\u2032 v \u2032 f )\n= ss\u2032 + ss\u2032 v \u2032 f + svf s\u2032 + svf s\u2032 v \u2032 f\n= ss\u2032 + ss\u2032 v \u2032 f + svs\u2032 f \u2212 svf 2 s\u2032 v \u2032\n= ss\u2032 + ss\u2032 v \u2032 f + svs\u2032 f\n= ss\u2032 + ss\u2032 v \u2032 f + ss\u2032 s\u2032\u22121 vs\u2032 f\n2\n\n\fby f 2 = 0. Using the 2:1 group homomorphism \u03c1 : SP IN(3) \u2192 SO(3) which\nis defined by s 7\u2192 \u03c1(s)(v) = svs\u22121 , we can write\ns(1 + vf )s\u2032(1 + v \u2032 f ) = ss\u2032 + ss\u2032 v \u2032 f + ss\u2032 \u03c1(s\u2032\u22121 )(v)f\n= ss\u2032 (1 + (v \u2032 + \u03c1(s\u2032\u22121 )(v))f ).\nSince the Clifford algebra is an associative algebra, the Clifford multiplication\nis also associative on SP IN(1, 0, 3).\nObviously, 1 \u2208 Cl1,0,3 belongs to SP IN(1, 0, 3).\nInverse of any element of SP IN(1, 0, 3) is given by\n(s(1 + vf ))\u22121 = s\u22121 (1 \u2212 \u03c1(s)(v)f ).\nDegenerate spin group can also be interpreted as a semi-direct product\n[3],[4]\nSP IN(1, 0, 3) \u2243 SP IN(3) \u22c9\u03c1 R3\nwhere \u03c1 : SP IN(3) \u2192 SO(3) is the 2:1 group homomorphism.\nThere is a second 2:1 group homomorphism given by\n\u03c1\u2032 : SP IN(1, 0, 3) \u2212\u2192\nSO(1, 0, 3)\n\u2032\ns\n7\u2212\u2192 \u03c1 (s)(x) = sxs\u22121\nor equally,\n\u03c1\u2032 : SP IN(1, 0, 3) \u2212\u2192 \u0012SO(1, 0, 3)\u0013\n1 2v\ns = s(1 + vf ) 7\u2212\u2192\n0 \u03c1(s)\nwhere the vector v = v1 e1 + v2 e2 + v3 e3 is taken to be a row vector.\nLie algebra of SO(1, 0, 3) is\nso(1, 0, 3) = {\u03c6 \u2208 Mat(4 \u00d7 4) | (G\u03c6)t + G\u03c6 = 0}\nthat is parameterized as\n\u0013\n\u0012\n0 a\n| r \u2208 so(3) a \u2208 Mat(1 \u00d7 3)}.\nso(1, 0, 3) = {\n0 r\n3\n\n\fAfter this we will consider the following basis for so(1, 0, 3)\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0 0\n0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n\uf8ec 0 0\n\uf8ec 0 0 0 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0 0 0 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nE01 = \uf8ec\n\uf8ed 0 0 0 0 \uf8f8 E02 = \uf8ed 0 0 0 0 \uf8f8 E03 = \uf8ed 0 0\n0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n\nE12\n\n\uf8eb\n\n0 0 0\n\uf8ec 0 0 1\n=\uf8ec\n\uf8ed 0 \u22121 0\n0 0 0\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0 0\n0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n0 0\n0 \uf8f7\nE =\uf8ec\n0 \uf8f8 13 \uf8ed 0 0\n0 \u22121\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0\n0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n0\n1 \uf8f7\nE =\uf8ec\n0 \uf8f8 23 \uf8ed 0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n1\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n0 \uf8f8\n0\n\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 \u22121\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n1 \uf8f8\n0\n\nLie algebra of SP IN(1, 0, 3) is given by the span of the following elements\nof Cl1,0,3\nspin(1, 0, 3) = {a | a \u2208 sp{f e1 , f e2 , f e3 , e1 e2 , e1 e3 , e2 e3 }} \u2282 Cl1,0,3 .\nDifferential map (d\u03c1\u2032 )1SP IN(1,0,3) : spin(1, 0, 3) \u2212\u2192 so(1, 0, 3) is an isomorphism between Lie algebras spin(1, 0, 3) and so(1, 0, 3). Their basis elements\ncorrespond as follows:\n(d\u03c1\u2032 )1SP IN(1,0,3) (ei ej ) = 2Eij\n(d\u03c1\u2032 )1SP IN(1,0,3) (f ei ) = \u22122E0i\n\n3\n\nNewton-Cartan Manifold, Degenerate Spin\nManifold and Degenerate Spinor Bundle\n\nLet g be a co-rank one degenerate symmetric metric tensor field on smooth\n4-manifold M, and let \u03c4 be a smooth 1-form such that \u03c4 (V ) = 1 where the\nnon-zero smooth vector field V satisfies g(X, V ) = 0 for all vector fields X.\nThen we obtain the following tensor fields ([5]):\n\u1e21 = \u03c4 \u2297 \u03c4 + g is a non-degenerate symmetric (0,2)-tensor field. In fact, \u1e21 is\nobviously symmetric. For non-degeneracy, let us consider kernel of R-linear\nmap \u03c4p : Tp M \u2192 R for all p \u2208 M. As ker(\u03c4p ) = {Up \u2208 Tp M|\u03c4p (Up ) = 0} is\na subspace of Tp M and dim(Tp M) = dim(ker(\u03c4p )) + dim(R), the dimension\n4\n\n\fof ker(\u03c4p ) is found to be 3. From \u03c4 (V ) = 1 we see that Vp is not element\nof ker(\u03c4p ) because \u03c4p (Vp ) = 1. Then choosing a basis {(U1 )p , (U2 )p , (U3 )p }\nof ker(\u03c4p ), the set {Vp , (U1 )p , (U2 )p , (U3 )p } becomes a basis of Tp M. On the\nother hand gp restricted to ker(\u03c4p ) is non-degenerate because of rank(g) = 3.\nOtherwise from the basis {Vp , (U1 )p , (U2 )p , (U3 )p } we would find rank(g) < 3.\nThe basis {(U1 )p , (U2 )p , (U3 )p } of ker(\u03c4p ) can be chosen orthonormal. Finally\nif we construct the matrix of \u1e21 with respect to the basis {Vp , (U1 )p , (U2 )p , (U3 )p }\nwe see that\n\u1e21p (Vp , Vp ) = \u03c4p (Vp )\u03c4p (Vp ) + gp (Vp , Vp ) = 1\n\u1e21p (Vp , (Ui )p ) = \u03c4p (Vp )\u03c4p ((Ui )p ) + gp (Vp , (Ui )p ) = 0\n\u1e21p ((Ui )p , (Uj )p ) = \u03c4p ((Ui )p )\u03c4p ((Uj )p ) + gp ((Ui )p , (Uj )p ) = \u03b4ij\nthe matrix is diagonal and det(\u1e21p ) = 1 6= 0 for all p \u2208 M where i, j = 1, 2, 3.\nTherefore \u1e21p is non-degenerate. Note that non-degeneracy (and degeneracy)\nis independent of the chosen of basis.\nSecondly there is another non-degenerate symmetric (2,0)-tensor field h\u0304 given\nby h\u0304(\u03b1, \u03b2) = \u1e21(\u03b1\u2217 , \u03b2 \u2217) for all one-forms \u03b1, \u03b2, where the star \u2217 denotes the\nmetric-dual of one-forms, and we have, locally, the relation h\u0304\u03bc\u03bb \u1e21\u03bb\u03bd = \u03b4\u03bd\u03bc .\nNote: For each one -form \u03b1 there exits a unique vector field \u03b1\u2217 , metric-dual\nof one-form \u03b1, such that \u03b1(X) = \u1e21(\u03b1\u2217 , X) for all vector fields X. Therefore\nwe have an isomorphism from the set of one-forms to the set of vector fields\n\u03b1 7\u2212\u2192 \u03b1\u2217 . As known, the set of one-forms and vector fields are modules over\nthe commutative ring C \u221e (M, R).\nh\u0304 is obviously symmetric and non-degenerate because of the above note and\nnon-degeneracy of \u1e21. The local relation is obtained as follows: In any coordinate system, if we take \u03b1 = dx\u03b7 , then we obtain (dx\u03bc )\u2217 = (\u1e21 \u22121 )\u03bc\u03ba \u2202\u03ba by the\naid of \u03b1(X) = \u1e21(\u03b1\u2217 , X) (where (\u1e21 \u22121 )\u03bc\u03bd is inverse matrix of \u1e21\u03bc\u03bd ). Thus we\nhave\nh\u0304(dx\u03bc , dx\u03bd ) = \u1e21((dx\u03bc )\u2217 , (dx\u03bd )\u2217 )\nh\u0304\u03bc\u03bd = (\u1e21 \u22121 )\u03bc\u03ba (\u1e21 \u22121 )\u03bd\u03c3 \u1e21\u03ba\u03c3 = (\u1e21 \u22121 )\u03bd\u03bc\nand from the symmetry of \u1e21 \u22121\nh\u0304\u03bc\u03bd = (\u1e21 \u22121 )\u03bc\u03bd .\nTherefore the expression h\u0304\u03bc\u03bb \u1e21\u03bb\u03bd equals to \u03b4\u03bd\u03bc .\nFinally, we note that h = \u2212V \u2297 V + h\u0304 is a co-rank one degenerate symmetric\n(2,0)-tensor field such that h\u03bc\u03bb g\u03bb\u03bd = \u03b4\u03bd\u03bc \u2212 V \u03bc \u03c4\u03bd .\n5\n\n\fM is called a Newton-Cartan manifold if M can be furnished by tensor\nfields g and \u03c4 satisfying the above properties. A linear connection on M\ncompatible with g and \u03c4 will be called a Newton-Cartan connection [5].\nLet M be a Newton-Cartan manifold, and let us consider the principal\nbundle PSO(1,0,3) on M. Then M will be called a degenerate spin manifold if\nthere exists a principal SP IN(1, 0, 3) bundle PSP IN (1,0,3) on M satisfying the\nfollowing property: Transition maps \u03c6\u03b1\u03b2 and \u03c6\ne\u03b1\u03b2 of the principal bundles\nPSO(1,0,3) and PSP IN (1,0,3) can be chosen on a joint covering {U\u03b1 }, such that\nthe following diagram commutes:\nSP IN(1, 0, 3)\no77\n\n\u03c6\ne\u03b1\u03b2 oooo\n\no\nooo\nooo\n\nU\u03b1 \u2229 U\u03b2\n\n\u03c1\u2032 2:1\n\n\u000f\u000f\n\n\u03c6\u03b1\u03b2\n\n//\n\nSO(1, 0, 3)\n\nAn algebra homomorphism \u03b8 : Cl1,0,3 \u2212\u2192 End(C4 ), i.e. a matrix representation of the degenerate Clifford algebra Cl1,0,3 , gives a group homomorphism \u03b8 : SP IN(1, 0, 3) \u2212\u2192 Aut(C4 ). By the aid of this group homomorphism we can construct the associated vector bundle PSP IN (1,0,3) \u00d7\u03b8 C4 which\nis called a degenerate spinor bundle.\n\n4\n\nLifting the Connection\n\nLet \u2207 be a linear connection on M such that \u2207Z g = 0 for all vector fields\nZ, i.e., g-compatible linear connection. We define the connection 1-form on\nPSO(1,0,3) by\na\n\nA\u03b1 (W ) = e (\u2207W Xb ) =\n\n3\nX\n\nW c \u0393acb\n\nc=0\n\nor\nA\u03b1 =\n\n3\nX\n\n\u0393acb ec = \u03c9 ab\n\nc=0\n\non U\u03b1 \u2282 M.
