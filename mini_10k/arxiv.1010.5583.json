A polynomial of degree \u2265 2 with coefficients in the ring of padic numbers Zp is studied as a dynamical system on Zp . It is proved that\nthe dynamical behavior of such a system is totally described by its minimal\nsubsystems. For an arbitrary quadratic polynomial on Z2 , we exhibit all its\nminimal subsystems.\n\n1. Introduction\nLet Zp be the ring of p-adic integers (p being a prime number). Let f \u2208 Zp [x] be\na polynomial of coefficients in Zp and with degree deg f \u2265 2. It is simple fact that\nf : Zp \u2192 Zp is a 1-Lipschitz map. In this paper we study the topological dynamical\nsystem (Zp , f ). We refer to [38] for dynamical terminology and [28, 31, 34, 35] for\nnotions related to p-adic numbers.\nOur first theorem is a general result which shows that a polynomial system\nadmits at most countably many minimal subsystems. This describes to some extent\nthe dynamical behavior of the system (see Theorem 4.2).\nTheorem A. Let f \u2208 Zp [x] with deg f \u2265 2. We have the following decomposition\nG G\nZp = A B C\nF\nwhere A is the finite set consisting of all periodic points of f , B = i Bi is the\nunion of all (at most countably many) clopen invariant sets such that each Bi is a\nfinite union of balls and each subsystem f : Bi \u2192 Bi is minimal, and each point in\nC lies in the attracting basin of a periodic orbit or of a minimal subsystem.\nWe will refer to the above decomposition as the minimal decomposition of the\nsystem f : Zp \u2192 Zp . A finite periodic orbit of f is by definition a minimal set. But\nfor the convenience of the present paper, only the sets Bi in the above decomposition\nare called minimal components.\nRecently the theory of Non-Archimedean, in particular of p-adic, dynamical\nsystems has been intensively developed ([6, 7, 8], [13], [14], [16], [17], [18], [19, 20],\n[24], [26], [30], [33], [37], [39]). See also the monographes [5], [25], [36] and the\nbibliographies therein.\nThere were few works done on the minimal decomposition. Multiplications on Zp\n(p \u2265 3) were studied by Coelho and Parry [11] and general affine maps were studied\nby Fan, Li, Yao and Zhou [15]. The minimal decomposition of a polynomial system\nhas been known in these cases and only in these cases. Quadratic polynomials will\nbe studied at the end of the present paper.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

The\nstatements 1)-3) were known to Pezda [32], the statements 1) and 2) are also found\nby Desjardins and Zieve [12] in a different way. The statement 4) is new.\nTheorem B. Let f \u2208 Zp [x].\n1) If p \u2265 5, the periods of periodic orbits are of the form ab with a|(p \u2212 1) and\n1 \u2264 b \u2264 p.\n2) If p = 3, the periods of periodic orbits must be 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 or 9.\n3) If p = 2, the periods of periodic orbits must be 1, 2 or 4.\n4) Let p = 2. If there is 4-periodic orbit, then f (z mod 2) mod 2 should be a\npermutation on Z/2Z. There is no 4-periodic orbit for quadratic polynomials.\nWhat kind of set can be a minimal component of a polynomial system? In a\nrecent work, Chabert, Fan and Fares [10] showed that each minimal component\nBi must be a Legendre set and that in general, any Legendre set is a minimal\ncomponent of some 1-Lipschtz system. We will show that for a polynomial system,\nthe minimal components Bi are Legendre sets of special forms. Let (ps )s\u22651 be a\nsequence of positive integers such that ps |ps+1 for every s \u2265 1. We denote by Z(ps )\nthe inverse limit of Z/ps Z, which is called an odometer. The map x \u2192 x+1 is called\nthe adding machine on Z(ps ) . We will prove the following theorem (see Theorem\n5.2).\nTheorem C. Let f \u2208 Zp [x] with deg f \u2265 2. If E is a minimal clopen invariant set\nof f , then f : E \u2192 E is conjugate to the adding machine on an odometer Z(ps ) ,\nwhere\n(ps ) = (k, kd, kdp, kdp2 , * * * )\nwith integers k and d such that 1 \u2264 k \u2264 p and d|(p \u2212 1).\n\nAs we have already pointed out, the minimal decomposition is fully studied for\naffine maps. It seems much more difficult to study the minimal decomposition for\nhigher order polynomials. In this paper, we try to attack the problem for quadratic\npolynomials. For an arbitrary 2-adic quadratic polynomial\nf (x) = ax2 + bx + c\non Z2 , we find all its minimal components.\nAs we shall see, such a quadratic system f : Z2 \u2192 Z2 is conjugate to one of the\nfollowing quadratic polynomials\nx2 \u2212 \u03bb,\n\nx2 + bx, x2 + x \u2212 d\n\u221a\nwhere \u03bb \u2208 Z2 , b \u2261 1 (mod 2) and d 6\u2208 Z2 . Our results are stated in Theorems\n6.1-6.9. Let us state here some of these results.\nTheorem D. Consider the polynomial x2 \u2212 \u03bb on Z2 .\n1) If \u03bb \u2261 0 (mod 4), then there are two attracting fixed points, one in 4Z2 with\nbasin 2Z2 , and the other one in 1 + 4Z2 with basin 1 + 2Z2 .\n2) If \u03bb \u2261 1 (mod 4), then the whole Z2 is attracted into a periodic orbit of period\n2 with one orbit point in 4Z2 , and the other one in 3 + 4Z2 .\n3) If \u03bb \u2261 2 (mod 4), then there are two attracting fixed points, one in 2 + 4Z2\n\n\f3\n\nwith basin 2Z2 , and the other one in 3 + 4Z2 with basin 1 + 2Z2 .\n4) If \u03bb \u2261 3 (mod 4), then the whole Z2 is attracted into a periodic orbit of period\n2 with one orbit point in 1 + 4Z2 , and the other one in 2 + 4Z2 .\nTheorem E. Consider the polynomial f (x) = x2 + x on Z2 [x]. There is one fixed\npoint 0. We have f (1 + 2Z2 ) \u2282 2Z2 and we can decompose 2Z2 as\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nG G\n2Z2 = {0} \uf8ed\n2n\u22121 + 2n Z2 \uf8f8 .\nn\u22652\n\nEach 2\n\nn\u22121\n\nn\n\n+ 2 Z2 (n \u2265 2) consists of 2n\u22122 pieces of minimal components:\n2n\u22121 + t2n + 22n\u22122 Z2 ,\n\nt = 0, . . . , 2n\u22122 \u2212 1.\n\nTheorem F. Consider the polynomial f (x) = x2 + x \u2212 d with d \u2261 3 (mod 4). Then\nf (2Z2 ) \u2282 1 + 2Z2 and 1 + 2Z2 is the unique minimal component of f .\n\nThe main idea used in the paper comes from Desjardins and Zieve's work [12]\nand the Ph.D thesis of Zieve [40]. Let E be an f -invariant compact set. It is now\nwell known that the subsystem (E, f ) is minimal if and only if the induced map\nfn : E/pn Z \u2192 E/pn Z is minimal (transitive) for any n \u2265 1 (see [4, 10]). The\nidea of Desjardins and Zieve is to establish relations between fn 's cycles and fn+1 's\nk\ncycles, by linearizing the k-th iteration fn+1\non a cycle of fn of length k.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give a full development of\nthe idea in [12] by studying the induced dynamical systems fn on Z/pn Z when\np \u2265 3. Section 3 is devoted to the case of p = 2 which was not treated in [12]. As\nwe shall see, the situation in the case p = 2 is not exactly the same as in the case\np \u2265 3. In Sections 4 and 5, we investigate how a minimal component is formed by\nanalyzing the reduced maps fn (n \u2265 1) and we prove the decomposition theorem.\nIn Section 5, we discuss the possible forms of minimal components. In Section 6, we\ngive a detailed description of the minimal decomposition for an arbitrary quadratic\npolynomial system on Z2 .\n2. Induced dynamics on Z/pn Z (p \u2265 3)\nThe main core of this section follows Desjardins and Zieve [12]. We shall give\nmore details and rewrite some proofs for reader's convenience. The case p = 2,\nwhich is a little bit special, will be fully discussed in the next section.\nLet p \u2265 3 be a prime (we may replace 3 by 2 in many places). Let n \u2265 1 be a\npositive integer. Denote by fn the induced mapping of f on Z/pn Z, i.e.,\nfn (x mod pn ) = f (x)\n\nmod pn .\n\nMany properties of the dynamics f are linked to those of fn . One is the following.\nTheorem 2.1 ([4], [10]). Let f \u2208 Zp [x] and E \u2282 Zp be a compact f -invariant set.\nThen f : E \u2192 E is minimal if and only if fn : E/pn Zp \u2192 E/pn Zp is minimal for\neach n \u2265 1.\nIt is clear that if fn : E/pn Zp \u2192 E/pn Zp is minimal, then fm : E/pm Zp \u2192\nE/pm Zp is also minimal for each 1 \u2264 m < n. So, the above theorem shows that it\nis important to investigate under what condition, the minimality of fn implies that\nof fn+1 .\n\n\f4\n\nOn the minimal decomposition of p-adic polynomial dynamical systems\n\nAssume that \u03c3 = (x1 , * * * , xk ) \u2282 Z/pn Z is a cycle of fn of length k (also called\nk-cycle), i.e.,\nfn (x1 ) = x2 , * * * , fn (xi ) = xi+1 , * * * , fn (xk ) = x1 .\nIn this case we also say \u03c3 is at level n. Let\nX :=\n\nk\nG\n\ni=1\n\nThen\n\nXi where Xi := {xi + pn t; t = 0, * * * , p \u2212 1} \u2282 Z/pn+1 Z.\n\nfn+1 (Xi ) \u2282 Xi+1 (1 \u2264 i \u2264 k \u2212 1) and fn+1 (Xk ) \u2282 X1 .\n\nIn the following we shall study the behavior of the finite dynamics fn+1 on the\nfn+1 -invariant set X and determine all cycles in X of fn+1 , which will be called\nlifts of \u03c3 (from level n to level n + 1). Remark that the length of any lift \u03c3\u0303 of \u03c3 is\na multiple of k.\nLet g := f k be the k-th iterate of f . Then, any point in \u03c3 is fixed by gn , the\nn-th induced map of g. For x \u2208 \u03c3, denote\nan (x) := g \u2032 (x) =\n\nk\u22121\nY\n\nf \u2032 (f j (x))\n\n(2*1)\n\nj=0\n\nbn (x) :=\n\ng(x) \u2212 x\nf k (x) \u2212 x\n=\n.\npn\npn\n\n(2*2)\n\nThe values on the cycle \u03c3 = (x1 , . . . , xk ) of the functions an and bn are important\nfor our purpose. They define, for each x, an affine map\n\u03a6(x, t) = bn (x) + an (x)t\n\n(x \u2208 \u03c3, t \u2208 Z/pZ).\n\nThe 1-order Taylor expansion of g at x implies\ng(x + pn t) \u2261 x + pn bn (x) + pn an (x)t \u2261 x + pn \u03a6(x, t)\n\n(mod p2n ).\n\n(2*3)\n\nAn important consequence of the last formula shows that gn+1 : Xi \u2192 Xi is\nconjugate to the linear map\n\u03a6(xi , *) : Z/pZ \u2192 Z/pZ.\n\nWe could call it the linearization of gn+1 : Xi \u2192 Xi .\nFor any x \u2208 X (and even for any x \u2208 Zp ), we can define the values of an (x) and\nbn (x) by the formulas (2*1) and (2*2). As we shall see in the following lemma, the\ncoefficient an (x) (mod p) is always constant on Xi and the coefficient bn (x) (mod\np) is also constant on Xi but under the condition an (x) \u2261 1 (mod p).\nDenote by vp (n) the p-valuation of n.\nLemma 2.2. Let n \u2265 1 and \u03c3 = (x1 , * * * , xk ) be a k-cycle of fn .\n(i) For 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 k, we have\nan (xi ) \u2261 an (xj ) (mod pn ).\n\n(ii) For for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k and 0 \u2264 t \u2264 p \u2212 1, we have\n\nan (xi + pn t) \u2261 an (xi ) (mod pn ).\n\n(iii) For 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k and 0 \u2264 t \u2264 p \u2212 1, we have\nbn (xi + pn t) \u2261 bn (xi )\n\n(mod pA ),\n\n\f5\n\nwhere A := min{vp (an (xi ) \u2212 1), n} = min{vp (an (xj ) \u2212 1), n} for 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 k.\n(iv) For all 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 k we have\nmin{vp (bn (xi )), A} = min{vp (bn (xj )), A}.\nConsequently, if an (xi ) \u2261 1 (mod pn ),\nmin{vp (bn (xi )), n} = min{vp (bn (xj )), n}.\nProof. Assertion (i) follows directly from the definition of an (xi ) and the fact that\n\u03c3 = (xi , fn (xi ), * * * , fnk\u22121 (xi )). The assertion (ii) is a direct consequence of\nan (xi + pn t) \u2261\n\nk\nY\n\nj=1\n\nf \u2032 (f j (xi + pn t)) \u2261\n\nk\nY\n\nf \u2032 (f j (xi ))\n\n(mod pn ).\n\nj=1\n\nThe 1-order Taylor expansion of g at xi gives\n\u0013\n\u0012\ng(xi ) \u2212 xi\nn\nn\nn\n+ pn t(g \u2032 (xi ) \u2212 1) (mod p2n ).\ng(xi + p t) \u2212 (xi + p t) \u2261 p\npn\n\nHence\n\nbn (xi + pn t) \u2261 bn (xi ) + t(an (xi ) \u2212 1) (mod pn ).\n\nThen (iii) follows.\nWrite\n\ng(f (xi )) \u2212 f (xi ) = f (f k (xi )) \u2212 f (xi ) = f (xi + pn bn (xi )) \u2212 f (xi ).\nThe 1-order Taylor expansion f at xi leads to\ng(f (xi )) \u2212 f (xi ) \u2261 pn bn (xi )f \u2032 (xi ) (mod p2n ).\nHence we have\nbn (f (xi )) \u2261 bn (xi )f \u2032 (xi ) (mod pn ).\n\nSince when A = 0, the result is obvious, we may suppose that A 6= 0. Then\nan (xi ) \u2261 1 (mod p) (for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k) which implies f \u2032 (xi ) 6\u2261 0 (mod p) for all\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 k. Notice that f (xi ) \u2261 xi+1 (mod pn ). Then by (iii), we obtain (iv).\n\u0003\nAccording to Lemma 2.2 (i) and (ii), the value of an (x) (mod pn ) does not depend\non x \u2208 X. According to Lemma 2.2 (iii) and (iv), whether bn (x) \u2261 0 (mod p) does\nnot depend on x \u2208 X if an (x) \u2261 1 (mod p). For simplicity, sometimes we shall\nwrite an and bn without mentioning x.\nThe above analysis allows us to distinguish the following four behaviors of fn+1\non X:\n(a) If an \u2261 1 (mod p) and bn 6\u2261 0 (mod p), then \u03a6 preserves a single cycle of\nlength p, so that fn+1 restricted to X preserves a single cycle of length pk. In this\ncase we say \u03c3 grows.\n(b) If an \u2261 1 (mod p) and bn \u2261 0 (mod p), then \u03a6 is the identity, so fn+1\nrestricted to X preserves p cycles of length k. In this case we say \u03c3 splits.\n(c) If an \u2261 0 (mod p), then \u03a6 is constant, so fn+1 restricted to X preserves one\ncycle of length k and the remaining points of X are mapped into this cycle. In this\ncase we say \u03c3 grows tails.\n(d) If an 6\u2261 0, 1 (mod p), then \u03a6 is a permutation and the l-th iterate of \u03a6 reads\n\u03a6l (x, t) = bn (aln \u2212 1)/(an \u2212 1) + aln t\n\n\f6\n\nOn the minimal decomposition of p-adic polynomial dynamical systems\n\nso that\n\n\u0013\nbn\n.\nan \u2212 1\nThus, \u03a6 admits a single fixed point t = \u2212bn /(an \u2212 1), and the remaining points lie\non cycles of length d, where d is the order of an in (Z/pZ)\u2217 . So, fn+1 restricted to\nX preserves one cycle of length k and p\u22121\nd cycles of length kd. In this case we say\n\u03c3 partially splits.\n\u0012\n\u03a6l (t) \u2212 t = (aln \u2212 1) t +\n\nNow let us study the relation between (an , bn ) and (an+1 , bn+1 ). Our aim is to\nsee the change of nature from a cycle to its lifts.\nLemma 2.3. Let \u03c3 = (x1 , . . . , xk ) be a k-cycle of fn and let \u03c3\u0303 be a lift of \u03c3 of length\nkr, where r \u2265 1 is an integer. We have\nan+1 (xi + pn t) \u2261 arn (xi )\n\n(mod pn ),\n\npbn+1 (xi + pn t)\n\n(1 \u2264 i \u2264 k, 0 \u2264 t \u2264 p \u2212 1)\n\n(2*4)\n\n\u0001\n\n(2*5)\n\n\u2261t(an (xi )r \u2212 1) + bn (xi ) 1 + an (xi ) + * * * + an (xi )r\u22121\nProof. The formula (2*4) follows from\nan+1 \u2261 (g r )\u2032 (xi + pn t) \u2261 (g r )\u2032 (xi ) \u2261\n\nr\u22121\nY\nj=0\n\n(mod pn ).\n\ng \u2032 (g j (xi )) \u2261 arn (mod pn ).\n\nBy repeating r times of the linearization (2*3), we obtain\ng r (xi + pn t) \u2261 xi + \u03a6r (xi , t)pn\n\n(mod p2n ),\n\nwhere \u03a6r means the r-th composition of \u03a6 as function of t, and\n\u0001\n\u03a6r (xi , t) = tan (xi )r + bn (xi ) 1 + an (xi ) + * * * + an (xi )r\u22121 .\n\nThus (2*5) follows from the definition of bn+1 and the above two expressions.\n\n\u0003\n\nBy Lemma 2.3, we obtain immediately the following proposition.\nProposition 2.4. Let n \u2265 1. Let \u03c3 be a k-cycle of fn and \u03c3\u0303 be a lift of \u03c3. Then\nwe have\n1) if an \u2261 1 (mod p), then an+1 \u2261 1 (mod p);\n2) if an \u2261 0 (mod p), then an+1 \u2261 0 (mod p);\n3) if an 6\u2261 0, 1 (mod p) and \u03c3\u0303 is of length k, then an+1 6\u2261 0, 1 (mod p);\n4) if an 6\u2261 0, 1 (mod p) and \u03c3\u0303 is of length kd where d \u2265 2 is the order of an in\n(Z/pZ)\u2217 , then an+1 \u2261 1 (mod p).\nThis result is interpreted as follows in dynamical system language:\n1) If \u03c3 grows or splits, then any lift \u03c3\u0303 grows or splits.\n2) If \u03c3 grows tails, then the single lift \u03c3\u0303 also grows tails.\n3) If \u03c3 partially splits, then the lift \u03c3\u0303 of the same length as \u03c3 partially splits,\nand the other lifts of length kd grow or split.\nIf \u03c3 = (x1 , * * * , xk ) is a cycle of fn which grows tails, then f admits a k-periodic\nFk\npoint x0 in the clopen set X = i=1 (xi + pn Zp ) and X is contained in the attracting\nbasin of the periodic orbit x0 , f (x0 ), * * * , f k\u22121 (x0 ).\nWith the preceding preparations, we are ready to prove the following Propositions 2.5-2.7 which predict the behavior of the lifts of a cycle \u03c3 by the properties of\n\n\f7\n\n\u03c3. We refer the reader to [12] for their proofs. Otherwise we can follow the similar\nproofs of Propositions 3.1-3.3 in the case p = 2.\nProposition\n\u03c3.\n1) If p \u2265 3\n2) If p > 3\n3) If p = 3\n\n2.5 ([12]). Let \u03c3 be a growing cycle of fn and \u03c3\u0303 be the unique lift of\nand n \u2265 2 then \u03c3\u0303 grows.\nand n \u2265 1 then \u03c3\u0303 grows.\nand n = 1, then \u03c3\u0303 grows if and only if b1 (x) 6\u2261 g \u2032\u2032 (x)/2 (mod p).\n\nAccording to 1) and 2) of Proposition 2.5, in the cases p \u2265 3, n \u2265 2 and p >\n3, n \u2265 1, if \u03c3 = (x1 , * * * , xk ) grows then its lift also grows, and the lift of the lift\nwill grow and so on. So, the clopen set\nX=\n\nk\nG\n\n(xi + pn Zp )\n\ni=1\n\nis a minimal set by Theorem 2.1.\nLet\nAn (x) := vp (an (x) \u2212 1), Bn (x) := vp (bn (x)).\nBy Lemma 2.2, for a cycle \u03c3 = (x1 , . . . , xk ), min{An (xi ), n} does not depend on\nthe choice of xi , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k and if Bn (xi ) < min{An (xi ), n} then Bn (xi ) does not\ndepend on the choice of xi , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k. Sometimes, there is no difference when we\nchoose xi or xj in the cycle. So, without misunderstanding, we will not mention xi\nin An and Bn (see the proof of Proposition 3.2 for the details corresponding to the\ncase p = 2).\nWe say that a cycle \u03c3 at level n splits l times if \u03c3 splits, and the lifts of \u03c3 at\nlevel n + 1 split and inductively all lifts at level n + j (2 \u2264 j < l) split. Similarly,\none can imagine what we mean if we say a cycle grows l times. That a cycle grows\nforever means that it grows infinite times.\nProposition 2.6 ([12]). Let p \u2265 3 and n \u2265 1. Let \u03c3 be a splitting cycle of fn .\n1) If min{An , n} > Bn , every lift splits Bn \u2212 1 times then all lifts at level n + Bn\ngrow forever.\n2) If An \u2264 Bn and An < n, there is one lift which behaves the same as \u03c3 (i.e.,\nthis lift splits and An+1 \u2264 Bn+1 and An+1 < n + 1) and other lifts split An \u2212 1\ntimes then all lifts at level n + An grow forever..\n3) If Bn \u2265 n and An \u2265 n, then all lifts split at least n \u2212 1 times.\nProposition 2.7 ([12]). Let p \u2265 3 and n \u2265 1. Let \u03c3 be a partially splitting k-cycle\nof fn and \u03c3\u0303 be a lift of \u03c3 of length kd, where d is the order of an in Z/pZ.\n1) If An+1 < nd, then \u03c3\u0303 splits An+1 \u2212 1 times then all lifts at level n + An+1\ngrow forever.\n2) If An+1 \u2265 nd, then \u03c3\u0303 splits at least nd \u2212 1 times.\nWe remark that in the partially splitting case, min{An+1 (x), nd} depends only\non the lifting cycle of fn+1 of length kd but not on x (see [12], Corollary 3).\n3. Induced dynamics on Z/pn Zp (p = 2)\nIn this section we focus on the special case p = 2 which is not considered in\n[12]. The first part in the preceding section (where p \u2265 3 is not explicitly assumed)\nremains true for p = 2. Notice that when p = 2, there is no partially splitting cycle.\n\n\f8\n\nOn the minimal decomposition of p-adic polynomial dynamical systems\n\nWe only need to study how a cycle grow or split. We distinguish four cases. Let\n\u03c3 be a cycle of fn . We say \u03c3 strongly grows if an \u2261 1 (mod 4) and bn \u2261 1 (mod 2),\nand \u03c3 weakly grows if an \u2261 3 (mod 4) and bn \u2261 1 (mod 2). We say \u03c3 strongly splits\nif an \u2261 1 (mod 4) and bn \u2261 0 (mod 2), and \u03c3 weakly splits if an \u2261 3 (mod 4) and\nbn \u2261 0 (mod 2).\nThe following results hold true when p = 2. Their proofs are postponed and got\ntogether at the end of this section.\nProposition 3.1. Let \u03c3 be a cycle of fn (n \u2265 2). If \u03c3 strongly grows then the lift\nof \u03c3 strongly grows. If \u03c3 weakly grows then the lift of \u03c3 strongly splits.\nThe first assertion of Proposition\nF3.1 implies that if \u03c3 = (x1 , * * * , xk ) is a strongly\ngrowing cycle of fn (n \u2265 2), then (xi + pn Zp ) is a minimal set.\nRecall that\nAn (x) = v2 (an (x) \u2212 1), Bn (x) = v2 (bn (x)).\n\nIn the following proposition, the x in An (x), Bn (x) can be chosen any xi of the\ncycle \u03c3 = (x1 , * * * , xk ) (see its proof).\n\nProposition 3.2. Let \u03c3 be a strongly splitting cycle of fn (n \u2265 2).\n1) If min{An , n} > Bn , then all lifts strongly split Bn \u2212 1 times, then all the lifts\nat level n + Bn strongly grow.\n2) If An \u2264 Bn and An < n, then one lift behaves the same as \u03c3 (i.e., this lift\nstrongly splits and An+1 \u2264 Bn+1 and An+1 < n + 1). The other one splits An \u2212 1\ntimes, then all the lifts lifts at level n + An strongly grow forever.\n3) If Bn \u2265 n and An \u2265 n, then all lifts strongly split at least n \u2212 1 times.\nProposition 3.3. Let \u03c3 be a weakly splitting cycle of fn (n \u2265 2). Then one lift\nbehaves the same as \u03c3 and the other one weakly grows and then strongly splits.\nTo prove these propositions, we need the following lemmas.\nLemma 3.4. Let \u03c3 be a growing cycle of fn (n \u2265 2). Then\nan+1 (xi ) \u2261 1\n\n(mod 4),\n\n2bn+1 (xi + pn t) \u2261 bn (xi )(1 + an (xi ))\n\n(3*1)\n(mod 4).\n\n(3*2)\n\nProof. Taking p = 2 and r = 2 in (2*4), we get\nan+1 (xi ) \u2261 a2n (xi ) (mod 2n ).\nSince n \u2265 2 and an \u2261 1 (mod 2), we obtain (3*1).\nTaking p = 2 and r = 2 in (2*5), we get\n2bn+1 (xi + 2n t) \u2261 t(an (xi )2 \u2212 1) + bn (xi )(1 + an (xi )) (mod 2n ).\nSince n \u2265 2 and an (xi ) \u2261 1 (mod 2), we obtain (3*2).\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 3.5. Let \u03c3 be a splitting cycle of fn . If An < n, then An+1 = An and if\nAn \u2265 n, then An+1 \u2265 n. Consequently,\nmin{An+1 , n} = min{An , n}.\n\n(3*3)\nn\n\nProof. We need only to notice that we have an+1 \u2261 an (mod 2 ) when \u03c3 splits. \u0003\n\n\f9\n\nLemma 3.6. Let \u03c3 = (x1 , . . . , xk ) be a splitting cycle of fn . Then for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k\nand for t = 0 or 1, we have\n2bn+1 (xi + 2n t) \u2261 bn (xi ) + t(an (xi ) \u2212 1)\n\n(mod 2n ).\n\n(3*4)\n\nConsequently, we have\n\nBn+1 (xi + 2n t) = Bn (xi ) \u2212 1\n\nif Bn (xi ) < min{An (xi ), n},\n\n(3*5)\n\nProof. Since \u03c3 splits, taking p = 2 and r = 1 in (2*5), we obtain the result.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe following lemma concerns an elementary property of polynomials on Z2 .\nLemma 3.7. Let h \u2208 Z2 [x]. If a \u2261 b (mod 2), then h\u2032 (a) \u2261 h\u2032 (b) (mod 4).\nFurthermore, if h\u2032 (a) \u2261 1 (mod 2), then h\u2032 (a)h\u2032 (b) \u2261 1 (mod 4) .\n\nProof. It suffices to notice that the coefficient of x2k+1 in h\u2032 (x) is equal to 0 (mod 2).\n\u0003\n\nLemma 3.8. Let \u03c3 be a growing k-cycle of fn (n \u2265 1). Then its lift strongly grows\nor strongly splits.\nProof. Let x1 be a point in \u03c3. What we have to show is an+1 (x1 ) \u2261 1 (mod 4).\nSince \u03c3 is a growing k-cycle, we have\nf k (x1 ) \u2261 x1 (mod 2n ),\n\nSo, by Lemma 3.7, we have\n\nan (x1 ) = (f k )\u2032 (x1 ) \u2261 1 (mod 2).\n\nan+1 (x1 ) = (f 2k )\u2032 (x1 ) = (f k )\u2032 (x1 )(f k )\u2032 (f k (x1 )) \u2261 1 (mod 4).\n\u0003\nA direct consequence is the following result.\nCorollary 3.9. If a cycle grows twice (maybe between the two growths, there are\nseveral splittings), then all the lifts will grow forever.\nProof. Let \u03c3\u0303 be the lift of the growing cycle \u03c3. Assume that after several times of\nsplitting, one of lifts of \u03c3\u0303 grows (then all the lifts at the same level grow). By Lemma\n3.8, this growing lift at a level n \u2265 2 must strongly grow. Thus by Proposition 3.1,\nthe lifts will grow forever.\n\u0003\nWe are now going to prove Propositions 3.1-3.3.\nProof of Proposition 3.1. If \u03c3 grows, then by (3*1), the lift of \u03c3 strongly grows\nor strongly splits. If \u03c3 strongly grows, then by (3*2), we have\nThus\n\n2bn+1 (xi + pn t) \u2261 2bn (xi ) (mod 4).\n\nbn+1 (xi + pn t) \u2261 bn (xi ) 6\u2261 0\nHence the lift of \u03c3 strongly grows.\nIf \u03c3 weakly grows, then by (3*2), we have\nThus\n\n2bn+1 (xi + pn t) \u2261 0\n\n(mod 2).\n\n(mod 4).\n\nbn+1 (xi + pn t) \u2261 0 (mod 2).\n\n\f10\n\nOn the minimal decomposition of p-adic polynomial dynamical systems\n\nHence the lift of \u03c3 strongly splits.\n\n\u0003\n\nProof of Proposition 3.2. First notice that if \u03c3 strongly splits then an \u2261\n1 (mod 4). Since n \u2265 2, by Lemma 2.2 we have al \u2261 1 (mod 4) for all l > n.\nSo, all the lifts strongly grow or strongly split.\nProposition 3.2 contains three cases which are defined by some conditions on\nAn and Bn . If such a condition is satisfied, we say \u03c3 or (An , Bn ) belongs to the\ncorresponding case.\nCase 1: min{An , n} > Bn . Recall that by Lemma 2.2, both min{An (xi ), n} and\nmin{An (xi ), Bn (xi ), n} are independent of xi . Thus in this case, we can simply\nwrite An and Bn . By (3*5), we have Bn+1 = Bn \u2212 1. Thus by (3*3)\nmin{An+1 , n + 1} \u2265 min{An+1 , n} = min{An , n} > Bn > Bn+1 .\nHence the lifts of \u03c3 still belong to Case 1. By induction, we know that after\nl := Bn times, Bn+l = 0 (i.e. bn+l 6= 0 mod p). Since \u03c3 strongly splits, we have\nan+l \u2261 1 (mod 4). Thus the lifts at level n + l strongly grow. That is to say all lifts\nof \u03c3 split Bn \u2212 1 times, then all the lifts lifts at level n + Bn strongly grow forever.\nCase 2: An \u2264 Bn and An < n. Since An (xi ) < n for some i, implies for all\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 k, An (xi ) = An (xj ). We can also deduce that if An (xi ) \u2264 Bn (xi ) for some\ni then for all i An (xi ) \u2264 Bn (xi ). Otherwise, if An (xj ) > Bn (xj ) for some j, then by\nLemma 2.2, Bn (xi ) = Bn (xj ) < An (xj ) = An (xi ) which leads to a contradiction.\nSo in this case, we can choose any 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k and we simply write An and Bn . By\nLemma 3.5, we have An+1 = An . Since Bn \u2265 An , there exists one t such that\nbn + t(an \u2212 1) \u2261 0\n\n(mod 2An +1 ),\n\nand the other one which we can write as 1 \u2212 t such that\nbn + t(an \u2212 1) 6\u2261 0\n\n(mod 2An +1 ).\n\nHence by (3*4), for one lift of \u03c3 Bn+1 \u2265 An and for the other one Bn+1 = An \u2212 1.\nThus for one lift, An+1 = An \u2264 Bn+1 , and An+1 = An < n + 1. Therefore, this\nlift belongs to Case 2. For the other one, Bn+1 = An \u2212 1 = An+1 \u2212 1 < An+1 ,\nand Bn+1 = An \u2212 1 < n + 1. Thus this lift belongs to Case 1. By induction, we\nknow that one lift of \u03c3 behaves the same as \u03c3 (i.e., strongly splits and satisfies the\ncondition of Case 2 at level n + 1) and the other one splits An \u2212 1 times, then the\nlifts strongly grow.\nCase 3: Bn \u2265 n and An \u2265 n. First we notice that by Lemma 2.2, if for some\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 k, we have Bn (xi ) \u2265 n and An (xi ) \u2265 n, then for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k, the\nsame property established. The following statement will be the same if we choose\nanother i. So we still simply write An and Bn . By the definition of bn , if the cycle\nsplits, the order of bn deceases at most one when the level goes up one step. Since\nBn \u2265 n, we have Bn+1 \u2265 n \u2212 1, and if n \u2265 2, the lifts of \u03c3 still strongly split. Thus\nby induction, the lifts of \u03c3 split at least n \u2212 2 times. But after that we can not give\nany more information.\n\u0003\nProof of Proposition 3.3. Since \u03c3 weakly splits, an+1 \u2261 an \u2261 3 (mod 4). Thus\nAn+1 = An = 1 < n and Bn \u2265 1 = An . Thus (An , Bn ) belongs to Case 2 in\nProposition 3.2. By the proof of Proposition 3.2, we know that for one lift of \u03c3,\nBn+1 \u2265 An and then An+1 = An \u2264 Bn+1 . Thus this lift behaves the same as \u03c3.\nFor the other lift, Bn+1 = An \u2212 1 = 0. Hence this second lift weakly grows, and\n\n\f11\n\nthen its lift strongly splits by Proposition 3.1. Therefore, we complete the proof.\n\u0003\n\n4. Minimal decomposition\nIf a cycle always grows (grows forever) then it will produce a minimal component\nof f . If a cycle always splits (splits infinite times) then it will produce a periodic\norbit of f . If a cycle grows tails, it will produce an attracting periodic orbit with\nan attracting basin. We shall describe this more precisely.\nLet \u03c3 = (x1 , . . . , xk ) be a cycle of fn . Recall that in this case \u03c3 is called a k-cycle\nat level n. Let\nk\nG\n(xi + pn Zp ).\nX :=\ni=1\n\nThere are four special situations for the dynamical system f : X \u2192 X.\n\n(S1) Suppose \u03c3 grows tails. Then f admits a k-periodic orbit with one periodic point in each ball xi + pn Zp (1 \u2264 i \u2264 k), and all other points in X are\nattracted into this orbit. In this situation, if x is a point in the k-periodic orbit,\nthen |(f k )\u2032 (x)|p < 1 since (f k )\u2032 (x) = am (x) \u2261 0 (mod pm ) for all m \u2265 n. The\nperiodic orbit (x, f (x), * * * , f k\u22121 (x)) is then attractive.\n(S2) Suppose \u03c3 grows and its lifts always grow. Then f is transitive (minimal)\non each X/pm Zp m \u2265 n. Thus, by Theorem 2.1, f is minimal on X. In this case,\nwe say that \u03c3 is a starting growing cycle at level n.\n(S3) Suppose \u03c3 splits and there is a splitting lift at each level larger than n. Then\nthere is a k-periodic orbit with one periodic point in each xi + pn Zp (1 \u2264 i \u2264 k).\nWe say that \u03c3 is a starting splitting cycle at level n. In this situation, if x is a point\nin the k-periodic orbit, then (f k )\u2032 (x) = 1 since (f k )\u2032 (x) = am (x) \u2261 1 (mod pm ) for\nall m \u2265 n. Thus the periodic orbit (x, f (x), * * * , f k\u22121 (x)) is indifferent.\n(S4) Suppose \u03c3 = (x1 , . . . , xk ) partially splits (p \u2265 3). Then by Proposition\n2.7, there is one lift of length k which still partially splits like \u03c3. Thus there is a\nk-periodic orbit with one periodic point in each xi + pn Zp (1 \u2264 i \u2264 k). In this\nsituation, if x is a point in the k-periodic orbit formed above, then |(f k )\u2032 (x)|p = 1\nsince (f k )\u2032 (x) = am (x) 6\u2261 0, 1 (mod pm ) for all m \u2265 n. Hence, the periodic orbit\n(x, f (x), * * * , f k\u22121 (x)) is indifferent.\nNow we can deduce all possible periods of the polynomial systems on Zp .\nTheorem 4.1. Let f \u2208 Zp with deg f \u2265 2.\n1) If p \u2265 5, the lengths of periodic orbits are of the form ab with a|(p \u2212 1) and\n1 \u2264 b \u2264 p;\n2) If p = 3, the lengths of periodic orbits must be 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 or 9;\n3) If p = 2, the lengths of periodic orbits must be 1, 2 or 4.\n4) Let p = 2. If there is 4-periodic orbit, then f1 should be a permutation on\nZ/2Z. There is no 4-periodic orbit for quadratic polynomials.\n\n\f12\n\nOn the minimal decomposition of p-adic polynomial dynamical systems\n\nRemark 1. The statements 1)-3) were due to Pezda ([32]). By using the idea we\nexplained in the preceding sections which is quite different from that of Pezda,\nDesjardins and Zieve ([12]) also gave 1) and 2). The statement 4) is new.\nProof. We only show 3) and 4), because the proofs of 1) and 2) are similar and can\nbe found in [12] and [32].\nNotice that any periodic orbit comes from an infinite sequence of splitting of some\ncycle, and that the length of the periodic orbit is the length of the starting splitting\ncycle. So, what we want to study are all possible lengths of starting splitting cycles.\nThe possible lengths of cycles at the first level (i.e. the cycles of f1 on Z/2Z)\nare 1 and 2. Notice that the growth of length must be multiplied 2, according to\nour discussion in the preceding sections. So, the possible lengths of cycles are 2k\n(k \u2265 0). However, by Corollary 3.9, if a cycle grows twice it will grow forever.\nThere, any cycle of length 2k (k \u2265 3), which must have grown twice, can not be a\nstarting splitting cycle. Hence the lengths of starting splitting cycles can only be\n1, 2, 4. This completes the proof of 3).\nIf there is a periodic orbit of length 4, there must be a starting splitting cycle of\nlength 4. This is possible only in the following case: at the first level, f1 admit a\n2-cycle. Otherwise it needs to grow twice and then its lifts will grow forever. This\nwill produce a clopen minimal set not a periodic orbit. This is the first part of 4).\nFor the second part of 4), one can see from our study on the quadratic polynomials\nin Section 6 (Theorems 6.1-6.9).\n\u0003\nTheorem 4.2. Let f \u2208 Zp [x] with deg f \u2265 2. We have the following decomposition\nG G\nZp = A B C\nF\nwhere A is the finite set consisting of all periodic points of f , B = i Bi is the\nunion of all (at most countably many) clopen invariant sets such that each Bi is a\nfinite union of balls and each subsystem f : Bi \u2192 Bi is minimal, and each point in\nC lies in the attracting basin of a periodic orbit or of a minimal subsystem.\nProof. We first explain that there are only finitely many periodic points. In fact,\nby Theorem 4.1, there are only finitely many possible lengths of periods. Periodic\npoints are solutions of the equations f qi (x) = x with {qi } being one of possible\nlengths of periods. Since deg f \u2265 2, each equation admits a finite number of\nsolutions. So, there is only a finite number of periodic points.\nWe start from the second level. Decompose Zp into p2 balls with radius p\u22122 . Each\nball is identified with a point in Z/p2 Z. The induced map f2 admits some cycles.\nThe points outside any cycle are mapped into the cycles. The ball corresponding\nto such a point will be put into the third part C. From now on, we really start our\nanalysis with cycles at level n \u2265 2. Let \u03c3 = (x1 , . . . , xk ) be a cycle at level n \u2265 2.\nLet\nk\nG\n(xi + pn Zp ).\nX=\ni=1\n\nSuppose p \u2265 3. We distinguish four cases.\n(P1) \u03c3 grows tails. Then by (S1), the clopen set X consists of a k-periodic orbit\nand other points are attracted by this periodic orbit. So, X contributes to the first\npart A and the third part C.\n\n\f13\n\n(P2) \u03c3 grows. Then by Proposition 2.5, \u03c3 is in the situation (S2). Therefore X\nis a minimal component. So, X \u2282 B.\n(P3) \u03c3 splits. Then we shall apply Proposition 2.6.\n\u2022 If \u03c3 belongs to Case 1 described by Proposition 2.6, then after finitely\nmany times of splitting, the lifts will grow forever and so they are in the\nsituation of (S2). Therefore we get a finite number of minimal components,\nall belonging to B.\n\u2022 If \u03c3 belongs to Case 2, then there is one lift of \u03c3 sharing the property (S3),\nand other lifts different from the cycle containing the periodic orbit (at any\nlevel m \u2265 n + 1) find themselves in the situation (S2) after finitely many\ntimes of lifting. Therefore, we get a periodic orbit and countable infinite\nminimal components.\n\u2022 If \u03c3 belongs to Case 3, then \u03c3 splits into pn cycles at level 2n. These\ncycles at level 2n may continue this procedure of analysis of (P3). But this\nprocedure can not continue infinitely, because there is only a finite number\nof periodic points. So, all these cycle may continue to split but they must\nend with their lifts belonging either to Case 1 or Case 2 in Proposition 2.6.\nSo, X contributes to both A and B.\n(P4) \u03c3 partially splits. Then \u03c3 is in the situation (S4). Thus there comes out\na periodic orbit. Suppose \u03c3m is the lift of \u03c3 containing the periodic orbit at level\nm \u2265 n + 1. If \u03c3m belongs to Case 1 in Proposition 2.7, then the other lifts different\nfrom \u03c3m+1 , will be in the situation (S1) after finite times. If \u03c3m belongs to Case\n2 in Proposition 2.7, then each of other lifts different from \u03c3m+1 , split to be pnd\u22121\ncycles at level nd. We then go to (P3) for these cycles at level nd.\nSuppose p = 2. We distinguish five cases.\n(Q1) \u03c3 grows tails. Then \u03c3 is in the situation (S1). We have the same conclusion\nas (P1) above.\n(Q2) \u03c3 strongly grows. Then by Proposition 3.1, \u03c3 is in the situation (S2). We\nhave the same conclusion as (P2) above.\n(Q3) \u03c3 strongly splits. By Proposition 3.2, the arguments are the same as (P3):\nThe procedures will be ended if the condition 1) or 2) in Proposition 3.2 is satisfied.\nIf the condition 3) in Proposition 3.2 is satisfied, we repeat the analysis of (Q3) for\nthe lifts of \u03c3. But the procedures will be eventually ended with the condition 1) or\n2), because there is only a finite number of periodic points.\n(Q4) \u03c3 weakly grows. Then by Proposition 3.1, the lift of \u03c3 strongly splits. We\nare then in the case (Q3).\n(Q5) \u03c3 weakly splits. By Proposition 3.3, then one lift is in the situation (S3)\nwhich produces a periodic orbit, and the other lifts different from the cycle containing the periodic orbit, at any level m \u2265 n + 1, will weakly grow. Then we are\nin the case (Q4).\nAll the above procedures will stop. So, we get the decomposition in finite steps.\n\u0003\nWe have excluded the affine polynomials from the theorem. Exactly speaking,\nthe conclusion is false for affine polynomials. For example, every points in Zp are\nfixed by f (x) := x. Anyway, affine polynomials have been fully studied in [15].\nCorollary 4.3. Let f \u2208 Zp [x] with deg f \u2265 2. If f admits an indifferent fixed point\nor a periodic orbit, then there exists a sequence of minimal components with their\n\n\f14\n\nOn the minimal decomposition of p-adic polynomial dynamical systems\n\ndiameters and their distances from the fixed point or the periodic orbit tending to\nzero.\n(n)\n\nProof. Suppose (x1 , . . . , xk ) is an indifferent periodic orbit. Let xj\n(n)\n(n)\n(x1 , . . . , xk )\n\n(n)\nxj\n\n\u2208 Z/pn Z and\n\n\u2261 xj (mod pn ) for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k. Then \u03c3n =\nis a splitting or\npartially splitting cycle at level n. By the procedures of the decomposition, the\ncycle \u03c3n should be in the situation (S3) or (S4). That is to say \u03c3n splits for all n\nor \u03c3n partially splits for all n.\nSince there are only finite number of periodic orbits, for any \u01eb > 0 small enough,\nthere is no other periodic orbits in the \u01eb neighborhood of the orbit (x1 , . . . , xk ).\nTake n such that p\u2212n < \u01eb. Then the lifts of \u03c3n which are different to \u03c3n+1 will\nnever split infinitely. Hence they will grow after finite times. Then all the lifts of\n\u03c3n which are different to \u03c3n+1 , considered as union of balls, consist of finite number\nof minimal components. Since these balls are contained in xj + pn Zp for each j\nrespectively. Thus there is a minimal component such that the diameter and the\ndistance to the orbit (x1 , . . . , xk ) are all less than p\u2212n . The result is obtained if we\nconsider infinitely n and find one minimal component for each n.\n\u0003\n5. Conjugacy classes of Minimal subsystems\nRecently, Chabert, Fan and Fares [10] proved that minimal sets of a 1-Lipschitz\nmap are Legendre sets. We shall prove that minimal sets of a polynomial are some\nspecial Legendre sets. A set E \u2282 Zp is a Legendre set if for any s \u2265 1 and any\nx \u2208 E/ps Zp , the number\n\b\nqs := Card y \u2208 E/ps+1 Zp : y \u2261 x mod ps\nis independent of x \u2208 E/ps Zp . Let\n\nps := q1 q2 * * * qs\n\n(\u2200s \u2265 1).\n\nIt is clear that ps = Card E/ps Zp . We call (ps )s\u22651 the structure sequence of E.\nConsider the inverse limit\nZ(ps ) := lim Z/ps Z.\n\u2190\n\nThis is a profinite group, usually called an odometer, and the map \u03c4 : x 7\u2192 x + 1 is\ncalled the adding machine on Z(ps ) .\nTheorem 5.1 ([10]). Let E be a clopen set in Zp and f : E \u2192 E be a 1-Lipschitz\nmap. If the dynamical system (E, f ) is minimal, then f is an isometry, E is a\nLegendre set and the system (E, f ) is conjugate to the adding machine (Z(ps ) , \u03c4 )\nwhere (ps ) is the structure sequence of E. On the other hand, on any Legendre set\nthere exists at least one minimal map.\nWe improve the above result in the case of polynomials by giving more information on the structure sequence.\nTheorem 5.2. Let f \u2208 Zp [x] with deg f \u2265 2. If E is a minimal clopen invariant\nset of f , then f : E \u2192 E is conjugate to the adding machine on an odometer Z(ps ) ,\nwhere\n(ps ) = (k, kd, kdp, kdp2 , * * * )\n\nwith some 1 \u2264 k \u2208 N, k \u2264 p and d|(p \u2212 1).\n\n\f15\n\nProof. By our previous discussion on the cycles of fn on Z/pn Z, a clopen minimal\nset E is formed when a cycle grows forever. If n is the starting level for the cycle\nto grow, then E is a union of some balls with radius p\u2212n . Therefore, for s \u2265 n,\nevery nonempty intersection of E with a ball of radius p\u2212s contains p balls of radius\np\u2212(s+1) . That is to say qs = p. From the cycle at the first level to the starting\ngrowing cycle at level n, the growth of cycle length is multiplied by 1, p or some d\nsatisfying d|(p \u2212 1). That is to say for 1 \u2264 s < n, every nonempty intersection of\nE with a ball of radius p\u2212s contains the same number (1, p or d) of balls of radius\np\u2212(s+1) . Thus E is a Legendre set. To determine ps for 1 \u2264 s < n, we distinguish\nthree cases: p \u2265 5, p = 3, p = 2.\nCase p \u2265 5. In this case, when a cycle grows, its lift grows forever. A cycle at\nlevel 1 may start with growing, several times of splitting or several times of partially\nsplitting and then the lifts grow forever. Therefore, there are three ways to form a\nminimal set. We show the three ways by the growth of cycle length as follows (k\nbeing the length of the cycle \u03c3 at the level 1).\nCase 1. \u03c3 grows:\n(k, kp, kp2 , . . . ),\nCase 2. \u03c3 splits:\n(k, k, . . . , k, kp, kp2 , . . . ),\nCase 3. \u03c3 partially splits:\n(k, kd, . . . , kd, kdp, kdp2 , . . . ),\n\nd|(p \u2212 1), d \u2265 2.\n\nThe above three cases correspond to three kinds of adding machines. However,\nby the result of Buescu and Stewart [9], the adding machines in both Case 1 and\nCase 2 are conjugate to (Z(ps ) , \u03c4 ) where ps = (k, kp, kp2 , . . . ). In Case 3, the\nadding machines are all conjugate to (Z(ps ) , \u03c4 ) where ps = (k, kd, kdp, kdp2 , . . . )\nand d|(p \u2212 1), d \u2265 2.\nCase p = 3. We distinguish four cases.\nCase 1. \u03c3 grows and its lift also grows:\n(k, kp, kp2 , . . . ),\nCase 2. \u03c3 grows but its lift splits:\n(k, kp, . . . , kp, kp2 , . . . ),\nCase 3. \u03c3 splits:\n(k, k, . . . , k, kp, kp2 , . . . ),\nCase 4. \u03c3 partial splits:\n(k, kd, . . . , kd, kdp, kdp2 , . . . ),\n\nd|(p \u2212 1), d \u2265 2.\n\nThen (E, f ) is conjugate to (Z(ps ) , \u03c4 ) where ps = (k, kd, kdp, kdp2 , . . . ) with 1 \u2264\nk \u2264 p, and d|(p \u2212 1).\nCase p = 2.

The proofs are\npostponed at the end of this section. By the way, we shall discuss the behavior of\nf on the field Qp .\nIf a \u2261 1 (mod 2), then limn\u2192\u221e |f n (x)| = \u221e for any x 6\u2208 Z2 . An elementary\ncalculation shows that ax2 + bx + c on Z2 is conjugate to x2 + bx + c on Z2 through\nthe conjugacy x 7\u2192 ax. If a \u2261 0 (mod 2), then limn\u2192\u221e |f n (x)| = \u221e for any x 6\u2208 a1 Z2\nand ax2 + bx + c on a1 Z2 is conjugate to x2 + ax + ac on Z2 through the conjugacy\nx 7\u2192 ax. Thus without loss of generality, we need only to consider the quadratic\npolynomials of the form\nx2 + bx + c (b, c \u2208 Z2 ).\nWe distinguish two cases according to b \u2261 0 (mod 2) or b \u2261 1 (mod 2)\n\n\f17\n\nIf b \u2261 0 (mod 2), x2 + bx + c is conjugate to\nwith \u03bb =\n\nb2 \u22124c\u22122b\n,\n4\n\nx2 \u2212 \u03bb\n\nthrough the conjugacy x 7\u2192 x +\n\nB\n2.\n\nTheorem 6.1. Consider the polynomial f (x) = x2 \u2212 \u03bb on Z2 .\n1) If \u03bb \u2261 0 (mod 4), then f admits two attracting fixed points, one in 4Z2 with\n2Z2 as its attraction basin, and the other one in 1+4Z2 with 1+2Z2 as its attraction\nbasin.\n2) If \u03bb \u2261 1 (mod 4), then the whole Z2 is attracted into a periodic orbit of period\n2 with one orbit point in 4Z2 and the other one in 3 + 4Z2 .\n3) If \u03bb \u2261 2 (mod 4), then f admits two attracting fixed points, one in 2+4Z2 2Z2\nas its attraction basin, and the other one in 3 + 4Z2 with 1 + 2Z2 as its attraction\nbasin.\n4) If \u03bb \u2261 3 (mod 4), then the whole Z2 is attracted into a periodic orbit of period\n2 with one orbit point in 1 + 4Z2 and the other one in 2 + 4Z2 .\nIf b \u2261 1 (mod 2), then x2 + bx + c is conjugate to\n2\n\nx2 + x \u2212 d\n\n2\nwhere d = (b\u22121)4 \u22124c \u2208 Z2 , through x 7\u2192 x + b\u22121\n2 . It is clear that x + x \u2212 d admits\n\u221a\n2\nfixed points if and if only d \u2208 Z2 . Thus we need to\n\u221a\n\u221a study the case x + x \u2212 d with\n2\nd \u2208\u221aZ2 and the case x + x \u2212 d with d \u2208 Z2 but d 6\u2208 Z2 .\nIf d \u2208 Z2 (i.e. x2 + x \u2212 d has a fixed point), then x2 + x \u2212 d conjugates to\n\nx2 + bx\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwith b = 1 \u2212 2 d, through x 7\u2192 x + d.\nIf b = 1, the minimal decomposition of x2 + x is as follows.\n\nTheorem 6.2. Consider the polynomial f (x) = x2 + x on Z2 [x]. There is one fixed\npoint 0. We have f (1 + 2Z2 ) \u2282 2Z2 and we can decompose 2Z2 into\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nG G\n2n\u22121 + 2n Z2 \uf8f8 .\n2Z2 = {0} \uf8ed\nn\u22652\n\nEach 2n\u22121 + 2n Z2 (n \u2265 2) consists of 2n\u22122 pieces of minimal components:\n2n\u22121 + t2n + 22n\u22122 Z2 ,\n\nt = 0, . . . , 2n\u22122 \u2212 1.\n\nDenote N\u2217 = N \\ {0}. If b \u2261 1 (mod 2) but b 6= 1, we distinguish four subcases:\n\u2022 b = 1 \u2212 4m, m \u2208 Z2 \\ {0};\n\u2022 b = \u22121 \u2212 4m, m \u2208 Z2 with v2 (m) \u2208 1 + 2N;\n\u2022 b = \u22121 \u2212 4m, m \u2208 Z2 with v2 (m) \u2208 2N\u2217 ;\n\u2022 b = \u22121 \u2212 4m, m \u2208 Z2 with v2 (m) = 0.\nIf f (x) = x2 + (\u22121 \u2212 4m)x with v2 (m) = 0, then f is conjugate to g(x) =\n2\nx + (\u22121 \u2212 4(\u2212m \u2212 1))x with v2 (\u2212m \u2212 1) = v2 (m + 1) \u2265 1 through x 7\u2192 x \u2212 4m \u2212 2.\nThus the last case is reduces to the second and the third case. So we need only\nconsider the first three cases.\nBefore the statement of the following results, we would like to give some terminology to simplify our statements.\n\n\f18\n\nOn the minimal decomposition of p-adic polynomial dynamical systems\n\nWe say a 1-cycle (x) at level n is of type I-[k] if it splits k times then its lifts grow\nforever. In this case, the ball x + pn Zp is decomposed into pk pieces of minimal\ncomponents. Such a component is a ball of radius p\u2212n\u2212k . Sometimes the ball\nx + pn Zp is said to be of type I-[k].\nWe say the a 2-cycle (x, y) at level n is of type II-[k] if it splits k times then its\nlifts grow forever.

Thus we will obtain the\npart E1 in Theorem 6.3.\nIf n > v2 (m) + 3,\nAn (2n\u22121 ) = v2 (m) + 2\n\nBn (2n\u22121 ) = v2 (m) + 1.\n\nHence, the cycle (2n\u22121 ) strongly splits and Bn < min{An , n}. By Proposition 3.2,\nthe lift of (2n\u22121 ) strongly splits Bn \u2212 1 = v2 (m) times then all lifts strongly grow.\nHence we have the part E2 .\nConsider 4m + 2n\u22121 + 2n Z2 (n > v2 (m) + 3). Let sn \u2261 4m + 2n\u22121 (mod 2n ) and\n0 \u2264 sn < 2n . We study the cycle (sn ) at level n.

By Proposition 3.2, the cycle (sn ) strongly splits and\nthe lift of (sn ) strongly splits Bn \u2212 1 = v2 (m) times then all lifts strongly grow.\nTherefore, we have the part E3 . This completes the proof.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 6.4. Let f (x) = x2 + (\u22121 \u2212 4m)x with v2 (m) \u2208 1 + 2N. We\nsee that there are two fixed points 0 and 4m + 2, and 1 + 2Z2 is mapped into 2Z2 .\nSince 0 and 4m + 2 are two fixed points, there are cycles (0) and (tn ) at each\nlevel, where tn \u2261 4m + 2 (mod 2n ) and 0 \u2264 tn < 2n . Consider the cycles (0) and\n(tn\u22122 ) at level n \u2212 2. By studying the an\u22122 , bn\u22122 of these two cycles, we know\nthat they weakly split. By Proposition 3.3, after splitting, half of lifts weakly grow.\nThus we will obtain two 2-cycles: (2n\u22122 , 2n\u22122 + 2n\u22121 ) and (sn , sn + 2n\u22121 ) at level\nn, where sn \u2261 4m + 2 + 2n\u22122 (mod 2n\u22121 ) and 0 \u2264 sn < 2n\u22121 .\nFor each n \u2265 4, we study the cycle (sn , sn + 2n\u22121 ) at level n.

Therefore,\nby Proposition 3.2, the lift of (sn , sn + 2n\u22121 ) strongly splits Bn \u2212 1 = 1 \u2212 1 = 0\ntimes then all lifts strongly grow. Thus we obtain E1 in Theorem 6.4.\nNow we study the cycle (2n\u22122 , 2n\u22122 + 2n\u22121 ) at level n \u2265 4. We have\nan (2n\u22122 ) = 23n\u22122 \u2212 3(4m + 1)22n\u22123 + m(4m + 1)2n+1 + 16m2 + 8m + 1\nbn (2n\u22122 ) = 2(2n\u22123 \u2212 2m \u2212 1)(22n\u22126 \u2212 m2n\u22122 \u2212 m).\n\nThus an (2n\u22122 ) \u2261 1 (mod 4) and for each n > \u230a v2 (m)\n2 \u230b + 3,\nAn (2n\u22122 ) = v2 (m) + 3\n\nBn (2n\u22122 ) = v2 (m) + 1.\n\nHence, the cycle (2n\u22122 , 2n\u22122 + 2n\u22121 ) strongly splits and Bn < min{An , n}. Therefore, by Proposition 3.2, the lift of (2n\u22122 , 2n\u22122 + 2n\u22121 ) strongly splits Bn \u2212 1 =\nv2 (m) + 1 \u2212 1 = v2 (m) times then all lifts strongly grow. Thus we have E3 .\nFor each 4 \u2264 n \u2264 \u230a v2 (m)\n2 \u230b + 3,\nAn (2n\u22122 ) = 2n \u2212 3\n\nBn (2n\u22122 ) = 2n \u2212 5.\n\nHence, if n > 4, then the cycle (2n\u22122 , 2n\u22122 +2n\u22121 ) strongly splits and An > Bn \u2265 n.\nTherefore, the lift of (2n\u22122 , 2n\u22122 + 2n\u22121 ) strongly splits at least n \u2212 1 times. But\nexcept this we do not obtain any further more information. Thus Proposition 3.2\nis not sufficient for us. Now we do some calculations directly.\nFor any point 2n\u22122 + t2n\u22121 \u2208 2n\u22122 + 2n\u22121 Z2 , with t \u2208 Z2 , we have\nf 2 (2n\u22122 + t2n\u22121 ) \u2212 (2n\u22122 + t2n\u22121 ) = 2n+1 (1 + 2t) * \u0398,\nwhere\n\u0001\n\u0398 := (2n\u22123 + t2n\u22122 \u2212 2m \u2212 1) (2n\u22123 + t2n\u22122 )2 \u2212 m(2n\u22122 + t2n\u22121 ) \u2212 m .\n\n(6*1)\n\n\f24\n\nOn the minimal decomposition of p-adic polynomial dynamical systems\n\nSince 4 \u2264 n \u2264 \u230a v2 (m)\n2 \u230b + 3, we have v2 (\u0398) = 2n \u2212 6, and\nf 2 (2n\u22122 + t2n\u22121 ) \u2212 (2n\u22122 + t2n\u22121 )\n\n\u2261 0 (mod 23n\u22125 )\n\n6\u2261 0 (mod 23n\u22124 )\n\nThus the cycles grow at level 3n \u2212 5. By Corollary 3.9, the cycles grow always.\nTherefore we obtain the part E2 which completes the proof.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 6.5. Let f (x) = x2 + (\u22121 \u2212 4m)x with v2 (m) \u2208 2N\u2217 . We see\nthat there are two fixed points 0 and 4m + 2, and 1 + 2Z2 is mapped into 2Z2 .\nAs the proof of Theorem 6.4, we study two 2-cycles: (2n\u22122 , 2n\u22122 + 2n\u22121 ) and\n(sn , sn +2n\u22121 ) at level n, where sn \u2261 4m+2+2n\u22122 (mod 2n\u22121 ) and 0 \u2264 sn < 2n\u22121 .\nThe existence of E1 , E2 , E3 are the same as that of Theorem 6.4.\n+ 3. We are going to study the cycle\nConsider 2n\u22122 + 2n\u22121 Z2 with n = v2 (m)\n2\n(2n\u22122 , 2n\u22122 + 2n\u22121 ) at level n. We study the points 2n\u22122 + t2n\u22121 \u2208 2n\u22122 + 2n\u22121 Z2 ,\nwith t \u2208 Z2 . With the same calculation in the proof of Theorem 6.4, we have\nthe same equation (6*1). To continue the proof, we will distinguish two cases:\nv2 (m) = 2 and v2 (m) \u2265 4.\nIf v2 (m) = 2, then n = v2 (m)/2 + 3 = 4 and\n\u0398 = (4t \u2212 2m + 1)[(4 \u2212 m) + 16(t + t2 ) \u2212 4m(1 + 2t)].\nThus if v2 (m \u2212 4) = 3, then v2 (\u0398) = 3 and\n\nf 2 (2n\u22122 + t2n\u22121 ) \u2212 (2n\u22122 + t2n\u22121 ) \u2261\n\n6\u2261\n\nIf v2 (m \u2212 4) \u2265 5, then v2 (\u0398) = 4 and\n\nf 2 (2n\u22122 + t2n\u22121 ) \u2212 (2n\u22122 + t2n\u22121 )\n\n0 (mod 28 )\n0 (mod 29 ).\n\n\u2261 0 (mod 29 )\n\n6\u2261 0 (mod 210 ).\n\nHence we will obtain (1) and (2) of Theorem 6.5.\nSince f 2 (x) \u2212 x = x(x \u2212 4m \u2212 2)(x2 \u2212 4mx \u2212 4m), f has 2-periodic orbit if and\nonly if x2 \u2212 4mx \u2212 4m = 0 has solutions different to 0 and 4m + 2 in Z2 . But\nx2 \u2212 4mx \u2212 4mx = 0 has solution 0 or 4m + 2 only if m = 0 or m = \u22121. Thus\nfor the case v2 (m) \u2208 N\u2217 , f has 2-periodic orbit if and if only \u25b3:= 16m2 + 16m has\nsquare roots in Z2 . By the standard argument in number theory (see [35], p.18),\nthis is equivalent to 2\u2212v2 (m) m(m + 1) \u2261 1 (mod 8). By some basic calculations it\nis then equivalent to v2 (m \u2212 4) = 4. This is nothing but the rest case we need to\nstudy. Thus for v2 (m \u2212 4) = 4, there exists a 2-periodic orbit.\nFrom the equation x2 \u2212 4mx \u2212 4m = 0, the periodic point can be written as\n!\n!\nr\nr\nm\nm(m + 1)\nm(m + 1)\nm\nx1 = 4\n, x2 = 4\n.\n+\n\u2212\n2\n4\n2\n4\nRecall that we are concerned with 2n\u22122 + 2n\u22121 Z2 (n = 4) which is the union of\ntwo balls 2n\u22122 + 2n Z2 and 2n\u22122 + 2n\u22121 + 2n Z2 , and we are studying the cycle\n(2n\u22122 , 2n\u22122 + 2n\u22121 ) at level n = 4. Thus we have x1 \u2261 4 (mod 16) and x2 \u2261\n12 (mod 16).\nFor each k \u2265 5, we consider the union of the two balls (x1 + 2k\u22121 + 2k Z2 ) \u222a\n(x2 + 2k\u22121 + 2k Z2 ). We study the cycle (s1 , s2 ) where s1 \u2261 x1 + 2k\u22121 (mod 2k ),\n\n\f25\n\ns2 \u2261 x2 + 2k\u22121 (mod 2k ) and 0 \u2264 s1 , s2 < 2k . For every point x1 + 2k\u22121 + t2k \u2208\nx1 + 2k\u22121 + 2k Z2 , (t \u2208 Z2 ), we have\n\nwhere\n\nf 2 (x1 + 2k\u22121 + t2k ) \u2212 (x1 + 2k\u22121 + t2k )\n\u0011\n\u0011 \u0010x\n\u0010x\n1\n1\n+ 2k\u22123 + t2k\u22122\n+ 2k\u22122 + t2k\u22121 \u2212 2m \u2212 1 * \u03a6,\n=23\n4\n2\n\n(6*2)\n\n\u03a6 := 2x1 (2k\u22121 + t2k ) + (2k\u22121 + t2k )2 \u2212 4m(2k\u22121 + t2k ).\n\nHere we have used the property that x1 is a solution of the equation x2 \u2212 4mx \u2212\n4m = 0.\nSince v2 (m) = 2 and v2 (x1 ) = 2, we get v2 (\u03a6) = k + 2. Thus\nf 2 (x1 + 2k\u22121 + t2k ) \u2212 (x1 + 2k\u22121 + t2k )\n\n\u2261 0 (mod 2k+5 )\n\n6\u2261 0 (mod 2k+6 ).\n\nHence we have (3).\nNow we are left to treat the case v2 (m) \u2265 4. In this case the equation x2 \u2212\n4mx \u2212 4m = 0 admits solutions if and only if v2 (m \u2212 2v2 (m) ) \u2265 v2 (m) + 3.\nv2 (m)\nWe still consider 2n\u22122 +2n\u22121Z2 with n = v2 (m)\n) < v2 (m)+3,\n2 +3. If v2 (m\u22122\nv2 (m)\nthen v2 (\u0398) = v2 (m \u2212 2\n) and for any t \u2208 Z2\nf 2 (2n\u22122 + t2n\u22121 ) \u2212 (2n\u22122 + t2n\u22121 )\n\nv2 (m)\n\n)+n+1\n\n)\n\nv2 (m)\n\n)+n+2\n\n).\n\n\u2261 0 (mod 2v2 (m\u22122\n6\u2261 0 (mod 2\n\nv2 (m\u22122\n\nThen we will obtain (4).\nIf v2 (m \u2212 2v2 (m) ) \u2265 v2 (m) + 3, then 2n\u22122 + 2n\u22121 Z2 consists of a 2-periodic orbit:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nq\nv (m)\nv2 (m)\n\u2212 22\n+1\n\u2032\n\u2212v\n(m)\n2\n2\n2\nm+ 2\nx1 = 2\nm(m + 1) ,\n\u0013\n\u0012\nq\nv (m)\nv2 (m)\n\u2212 22\n+1\n\u2032\n\u2212v\n(m)\n2\n2\nm(m + 1) .\n2\nm\u2212 2\nx2 = 2\n\nFor each k \u2265 v2 (m)\n+ 4, we consider (x\u20321 + 2k\u22121 + 2k Z2 ) \u222a (x\u20322 + 2k\u22121 + 2k Z2 ).
