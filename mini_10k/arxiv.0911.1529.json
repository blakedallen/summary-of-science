The harmonic spectrum has the following\ncharacteristics as a function of increasing frequency: a rapid decrease in harmonic intensity\nat first, followed by a plateau region with the harmonics having similar intensities; and then\na rapid drop in harmonic strength beyond the plateau region. Recently, lots of theoretical\nworks have studied this multiphoton phenomenon, including solving the time-dependent\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], the semiclassical trajectory methods, such as the threestep model [9] and the Feynman's path-integral approach in the strong field approximation\n[10, 11, 12], and even the classical trajectory method [13].\nBohmian mechanics (BM) [14, 15, 16], or called quantum trajectory method [17], is another alternative formalism of quantum mechanics. In the early years, BM has been used to\nstudy some fundamental quantum phenomena such as the scattering by a square potential\nbarrier [18, 19] and the diffraction through two slits [20]. Recently, it has been applied to\nstudy and analyze many different processes and phenomena in physics and chemistry, such\nas atom-surface scattering [21, 22], electron transport in mesoscopic systems [23], photodissociation of NOCl and NO2 [24], and the chemical reactions [25]. Also, BM in terms of\nquantum trajectory has been considered to study chaos [26, 27, 28, 29]. Recently, it has\nbeen successfully applied to the intense laser-atom physics to study the dynamics of the\nabove-threshold ionization (ATI) photoelectron by authors [30].\nIn this paper, BM is introduced to the intense laser-atom physics to study HHG, which\nallows us to follow the time evolution of individual electron trajectory in atomic system\nfirst. We then calculate the power spectrum with the electron trajectory and find the corresponding spectrum is irregular. Next, we consider the power spectrum associated with an\natom ensemble. In the atom ensemble, harmonic generation is determined by the Maxwell\nequation, where the electronic polarization of the atom ensemble plays a key role for the\nharmonic generation. We will show the electronic polarization of the atom ensemble gained\nfrom BM is equivalent to that obtained from quantum mechanics. On this condition, the\npower spectrum from BM is regular and consistent with that obtained from quantum mechanics. Finally, we will briefly discuss the reason why an individual electron trajectory\n2\n\n\fgenerates the irregular spectrum.\nThis paper is organized as follow: We will briefly introduce quantum trajectory method\nfirst. Then we show the Hamiltonian for the hydrogen atom in ILF. In Sec. IV, we calculate\nthe harmonic spectrum from a single electron trajectory, following by harmonic generation\nassociated with an ensemble of atoms interacting with the ILF in Sec. V. Finally, we briefly\ndiscuss the reason of the generation of the irregular spectrum with an individual electron\ntrajectory and then conclude.\n\nII.\n\nQUANTUM TRAJECTORY FORMALISM OF BOHMIAN MECHANICS\n\nQuantum trajectory method comes from the following transformation of the timedependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation [14, 15]. Firstly a wave function can be written in the\npolar form \u03c8(r, t) = R(r, t) exp(iS(r, t)/~). Secondly \u03c8(r, t) is substituted into the timedependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Then the real part of the resulting equation is\n\u2202S (\u2207S)2\n+\n+V +Q=0\n\u2202t\n2m\n\n(1)\n\nand the imaginary part has the form\n\u2202\u03c1\n+ \u2207(\u03c1v) = 0,\n\u2202t\n\n(2)\n2\n\n2\n\n~ \u2207 R\n. These two equations\nwhere \u03c1(r, t) = R2 (r, t), v = \u2207S(r, t)/m, and Q(r, t) = \u2212 2m\nR\n\nlook like the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation and the equation of continuity, respectively,\nexcept Eq. (1) has an extra term Q which is usually called quantum potential in BM. Thus\nEq. (1) is called the quantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation governed by an external potential\nV and the quantum potential Q. The motion of particle is guided by the Bohm-Newton\nequation of motion, md2 r/dt2 = \u2212\u2207(V + Q), or, equivalently, by\ndr/dt = \u2207S(r, t)/m.\n\n(3)\n\nIn practice, we solve the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation to obtain \u03c8(r, t), and then\nS(r, t). In this way, the quantum trajectory of the particle can be gained by integrating Eq.\n(3).\n\n3\n\n\fIII.\n\nNUMERICAL SOLUTION OF THE TIME-DEPENDENT SCHR\u00d6DINGER\n\nEQUATION\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation for Hydrogen atom in ILF can be written as (atomic units are\nused throughout)\ni\n\n\u2202\u03c8(r, t)\nb 0 (r) + Vb (r, t)]\u03c8(r, t).\n= [H\n\u2202t\n\nb 0 (r) is the field-free Hydrogen atom Hamiltonian and Vb (r, t) is the intense laserHere H\nb 0 (r) = \u2212 1 d22 + Lb22 \u2212 1 , Vb (r, t) = \u2212r * E(t) = \u2212zE(t), where the\natom interaction: H\n2 dr\n2r\nr\n\nlaser field is the linearly polarized field (E||z) and E(t) is the laser field profile. Due to\nthe linearly polarized laser field, magnetic quantum number m of Hydrogen atom is a good\nquantum number, so that the problem of solving the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger here can be\nsimplified into a two-dimensional problem (see the inset in Fig. 1). In this work the solution\nof the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation \u03c8(r, t) is obtained by the grid method and the\nsecond-order split-operator method,\n\uf8f1 which has been detailedly introduced by Tong et al [31].\n\uf8f2 E sin2 ( \u03c0t ) sin(\u03c9 t), 0 \u2264 t \u2264 10T ;\n0\n0\n20T\nwhere T = 2\u03c0/\u03c90,\nThe laser field profile is E(t) =\n\uf8f3 E0 sin(\u03c90 t),\nt > 10T,\nand E0 and \u03c90 are the electric field amplitude and angular frequency, respectively. We choose\nE0 = 0.0292 a.u. (i.e., I = 3.0 \u00d7 1013 W/cm2 ), and \u03c90 = 0.0587 a.u. (i.e., \u03bb = 775nm). The\ninitial wave function \u03c8(r, 0) of the system is in the ground state of the field-free Hydrogen\natom.\n0.01\n\nz\n\n1E-3\n\nr\n\n1E-4\n\nx\n\nE0||z\n\n)\nP(\n\no\n\n0\n\n1E-5\n\ne\n\n1E-6\n\n1E-7\n\n1E-8\n\n1E-9\n\n1E-10\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nHarmonic order (\n\n12\n\n/\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n)\n\nFIG. 1: Power spectrum of the electron with the initial position r0 = (1.0 a.u., \u03c0/4). The inset\nshows the direction of the laser beam and the electron coordinate of atomic system.\n\n4\n\n\fIV.\n\nHARMONIC SPECTRUM ASSOCIATED WITH A SINGLE ELECTRON\n\nTRAJECTORY\n\nAfter obtaining the wavefunction \u03c8(r, t), we can follow the time evolution of electron\ntrajectory r(t) by integrating Eq. (3) with the electron initial position r0 . According to\nBM [14, 15, 16], the initial electron distribution is |\u03c8(r, 0)|2. In this work, \u03c8(r, 0) is the\nground state of the field-free Hydrogen atom. Thus we can obtain an ensemble of electron\ntrajectories with the corresponding electron initial positions. For an individual electron\ntrajectory, the atomic dipole moment \u03bcz (t) along the laser polarization direction is \u1e91 * r(t).\nThe corresponding power spectrum is gained by the Fourier transformation of the dipole\nmoment [13, 32]:\n1\nP (\u03c9) =\ntf \u2212 ti\n\nZ\n\n2\n\ntf\n\u2212i\u03c9t\n\n\u03bcz (t)e\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nti\n\nwhere ti = 0 and the propagation time tf is 35T in this work.\nExplicitly, we take one atomic electron as an example with the initial position r0 = (1.0\na.u., \u03c0/4) in polar coordinates. The electron trajectory r(t) is calculated by integrating Eq.\n(3). The corresponding power spectrum is shown in Fig. 1 from Eq. (4). The spectrum\nhas even harmonics, which is dominated by a Rayleigh scattering component at the laser\nfrequency \u03c9 = \u03c90 . We have obtained lots of electron trajectories with different initial position\nr0 according to the initial electron distribution |\u03c8(r, 0)|2. The corresponding power spectra\nhave the similar character described above. In the following, however, we will show the even\nharmonics of the power spectrum are coherently removed in an ensemble of atoms and the\ncorresponding power spectrum is consistent with that obtained from quantum mechanics.\n\nV.\n\nHARMONIC GENERATION FROM AN ENSEMBLE OF ATOMS INTER-\n\nACTING WITH THE INTENSE LASER FIELD\n\nThe harmonic generation of an atom ensemble can be gained with the Maxwell equation\n[33, 34, 35, 36]:\n\u22072 E \u2212\n\n4\u03c0 \u2202 2 P\n1 \u22022E\n=\n,\nc2 \u2202t2\nc2 \u2202t2\n\nwhere P(r\u2032 , t) is the electronic polarization of the atom ensemble at the point r\u2032 and E (r\u2032 , t)\ndescribes the electromagnetic field (involving the fundamental and the harmonic fields).\nObviously, the electronic polarization P(r\u2032 , t) plays a key role for the harmonic generation\n5\n\n\ffrom the ensemble of atoms. We will show that the electronic polarization P(r\u2032 , t) gained\nfrom BM is, approximately, equivalent to that obtained from quantum mechanics, i.e., both\nof their harmonic spectra from the atom ensemble are consistent.\nWe first assume the number of atoms is N in a small volume \u2206V near the point r\u2032 in the\natom ensemble ( \u2206V \u226a d3 , where d is the focal spot size of laser). The electronic polarization\nN\nP\nP(r\u2032 ) is defined as the atomic dipole moment per unit volume: P(r\u2032) =\npi /\u2206V , where\ni\n\npi is the atomic dipole moment of each atom in the small volume \u2206V . From the view\n\npoint of quantum mechanics, the dipole moment of each atom is p(t) = h\u03c8(r, t)|z|\u03c8(r, t)i\nin the \u1e91 direction, where r is the electron coordinate of atomic system and \u03c8(r, t) is the\nelectron wavefunction. Thus the electronic polarization of the atom ensemble obtained from\nquantum mechanics is\nP(r\u2032 , t) = Np(t)/\u2206V\n\n(5)\n\nin the \u1e91 direction.\n\ne\n\nr\n\nFIG. 2: A small volume \u2206V near the point r\u2032 in the atom ensemble, which includes lots of atoms\nwith the different dipole moments from the view of BM. The inset shows the electron coordinate\nof atomic system.\n\nOn the other hand, we calculate the electronic polarization of the atom ensemble from\nBM. According to BM [14, 15, 16], the probability that an electron lies between r and r + dr\nin the atomic system at the time t is given by |\u03c8(r, t)|2dr, where the corresponding atomic\ndipole moment is r (in atomic units). Then in the small volume \u2206V of the atom ensemble,\nthe number of atoms with atomic dipole moment r is (N|\u03c8(r, t)|2 dr). The sum of all kinds\n6\n\n\fP\n\nN|\u03c8(rj , t)|2 drj rj . Thus the electronic\nj\nP\npolarization P(r\u2032 , t) at the point r\u2032 in the atom ensemble is\nN|\u03c8(rj , t)|2 drj rj /\u2206V (see\nof atomic dipole moments in the volume \u2206V is\n\nj\n\nFig. 2). For an atom ensemble, we can replace the sum by an integral,\nZ\nX N|\u03c8(rj , t)|2 drj rj\nN\n|\u03c8(r, t)|2 rdr.\n\u2192\n\u2206V\n\u2206V\nj\n\n(6)\n\nFurther, because the laser field is the linearly polarized field (E||z), the time-dependent\nwavefunction \u03c8(r, t) is symmetrical along \u1e91 axis. Thus in the \u1e91 direction,\nZ\nZ\nN\nN\n2\n|\u03c8(r, t)| rdr =\n|\u03c8(r, t)|2 r cos \u03b8dr\n\u2206V\n\u2206V\nZ\nN\n=\n|\u03c8(r, t)|2 zdr,\n\u2206V\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the last term equals Eq. (5). In this way, the electronic polarization P(r\u2032, t) gained\nfrom BM is, approximately, equivalent to that obtained from quantum mechanics, i.e., both\nof their harmonic spectra from the atom ensemble are the same. Figure 3 shows the harmonic spectrum from an ensemble of Hydrogen atoms interacting with ILF (laser confocal\nparameter b = 5.0 mm, gas density 1017 atoms/cm3 described by a truncated Lorentzian in\nthe x\u0302 direction with L = 0.5 mm [33]), which has a clear plateau region and cutoff at the\n11th order.\n\n0.01\n\n1E-3\n\n1E-4\n\n1E-6\n\nP(\n\n)\n\n1E-5\n\n1E-7\n\n1E-8\n\n1E-9\n\n1E-10\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nHarmonic order (\n\n12\n\n/\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n)\n\nFIG. 3: Harmonic spectrum associated with an ensemble of Hydrogen atoms at the laser field\nI = 3.0 \u00d7 1013 W/cm2 and \u03bb = 775nm.\n\n7\n\n\fVI.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn BM, harmonic spectrum from a single electron trajectory has even harmonics (see\nFig. 1), but they are removed in the spectrum associated with an ensemble of atoms (see\nFig. 3). The reason is that an individual electron trajectory does not possess an inversion\ncenter [13], but the electron trajectories of the atom ensemble have such centre. Here we\nwill numerically show that two electron trajectories are enough to get rid of the unphysical\neven harmonics if the initial positions r0 of the two electrons are centrally symmetric. Let's\ntake two electrons as an example with the initial positions r10 = (1.0 a.u., \u03c0/4) and r20 = (1.0\na.u., 5\u03c0/4), respectively. The corresponding atomic dipole moment \u03bcz (t) along the laser\npolarization direction is \u1e91 * [r1 (t) + r2 (t)] and the power spectrum gained from Eq. (4) is\nshown in Fig. 4 (solid curve), which has only odd-order harmonics. In addition, we calculate\nthe HHG power spectrum in the length form from the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation\n(dotted curve in Fig. 4) [31]. Note that these two curves can basically overlap if the value of\nthe power spectrum from BM is multiplied by a factor of 0.4, i.e., both of them have the same\nrelative intensity. This is an interesting result, but the reason why HHG power spectra from\nBM and the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation have the same relative intensity should\nbe studied in the future.\n0.01\n\n1E-3\n\nBM\nTDSE\n\n1E-4\n\nP(\n\n)\n\n1E-5\n\n1E-6\n\n1E-7\n\n1E-8\n\n1E-9\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nHarmonic order (\n\n12\n\n/\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n)\n\nFIG. 4: The solid curve corresponds to power spectrum of two Bohmian electrons with the centrally\nsymmetric initial positions: r10 = (1.0 a.u., \u03c0/4) and r20 = (1.0 a.u., 5\u03c0/4). The dot is the HHG\npower spectrum in the length form from the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation (TDSE).\n\n8\n\n\fVII.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn summary, we introduce BM into the intense laser-atom physics to discuss HHG. It\nallows us to follow the time evolution of each electron trajectory in an atomic system. We\nfind that the power spectrum from an individual electron trajectory has the even unphysical\nharmonics. But the even harmonics are coherently removed in the ensemble of atoms and\nthe power spectrum is consistent with that obtained from quantum mechanics. The reason\nof the appearance of the even harmonics is an individual electron trajectory does not possess\nan inversion center, but the electron trajectories of the atom ensemble have such centre.\n\n[1] Burnett K, Reed V C and Knight P L 1993 J.
