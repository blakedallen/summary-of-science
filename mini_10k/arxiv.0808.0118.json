Introduction\nWhen a stellar system is formed out of gas, the dying stars\nenrich the remaining gas so that new stars are metal-enriched\ncompared to their ancestors. Simple models of chemical evolution have been used since decades to interpret the evolution\nof the chemical composition of stars and gas. Pioneering works\nhave determined the evolution of the metallicity in the Galaxy\n(Schmidt 1963; Searle & Sargent 1972; Tinsley 1974; Pagel &\nPatchett 1975) by making very simplifying hypotheses about the\ninitial mass function (IMF), the lifetime of stars and the mixing\nof chemical elements with the surrounding interstellar medium\n(ISM).\nThese models remain useful guides for understanding the\nmain chemical properties of galaxies, but it was soon realized\nthat they cannot give a complete picture of galaxy evolution. In\nparticular, simple closed box models cannot reproduce the distribution of metallicity of long-living stars in the galaxy (G-dwarf\nproblem, Lynden-Bell 1975; Rana 1991 and references therein).\nThe most obvious solution to the G-dwarf problem is to relax the\nSend offprint requests to: S.

Increasingly complex models of chemical evolution including gas flows (infall,\noutflow, radial flows), but always assuming the instantaneous recycling approximation (IRA)1 , have been proposed, covering a\nlarge variety of galactic morphologies (Larson 1976; Clayton\n1988; Edmunds 1990; K\u00f6ppen 1994; Martinelli & Matteucci\n2000). These models consider the global metallicity Z and neglect metallicity-enriched outflows, so they cannot be used to\npredict variations of abundance ratios. Pagel & Tautvai\u0161ien\u0117\n(1998) have calculated abundance ratios using analytical models, but they had to assume that chemical elements such as iron\nare ejected with a fixed time delay \u2206 after the time of star formation. This is a rough approximation since it is known that the progenitors of SNeIa span a very wide lifetime (see e.g. Matteucci\n& Recchi 2001). Only detailed numerical models relaxing IRA\nand including the chemical enrichment from Type Ia SNe (e.g.\nMatteucci & Greggio 1986) allow one to follow in detail the evolution of single elements. Matteucci & Greggio (1986) showed\nin detail the effect of the time-delay model, already suggested by\nTinsley (1980) and Greggio & Renzini (1983), in particular the\neffect of a delayed Fe production by Type Ia SNe on abundance\nratios involving \u03b1-elements (O, Mg, Si).\n1\nIRA assumes that stars with masses larger than 1 M\u2299 die instantaneously whereas those below 1 M\u2299 live forever (Matteucci 2001)\n\n\f2\n\nSimone Recchi et al.: Differential winds and chemical evolution of galaxies\n\nOutflows and galactic winds are produced when the thermal\nenergy of a galaxy (produced by energetic events such as SN\nexplosions and stellar winds) is enough to unbind a large fraction of the ISM (Mathews & Baker 1971). The existence of differential winds, namely galactic winds in which the metals (or\nsome of them) are ejected out of the parent galaxy more efficiently than the other elements, has been first hypothesized and\napplied to the chemical evolution of galaxies by Pilyugin (1993)\nand Marconi et al. (1994). In particular, Marconi et al. (1994)\nsuggested that the chemical properties of gas-rich dwarf irregular galaxies, most remarkably the spread in H/He vs. O/H and\nN/O vs. O/H, can be more easily explained by assuming differential winds, in which products of SNeII (mostly \u03b1-elements and\none third of iron) can escape the potential well of a galaxy more\neasily than other elements formed in low and intermediate mass\nstars. Hereafter we will call selective winds the differential winds\nin which different metals have different ejection efficiencies. The\nexistence of differential and selective winds has been theoretically confirmed by several detailed chemodynamical simulations\n(MacLow & Ferrara 1999; D'Ercole & Brighenti 1999; Recchi\net al. 2001; Fujita et al. 2004) and it has been observationally\nconfirmed by determining the metallicity of outflows in starburst\ngalaxies (Martin et al. 2002; Ott et al. 2005). Recently, Salvadori\net al. (2008) have suggested differential winds coupled with relaxation of IRA in massive stars to explain the steep decline of\nthe [O/Fe] ratio observed in the stars of Sculptor, without invoking any Fe production from Type Ia SNe.\nIn this paper we apply the hypothesis of differential and selective winds in the framework of simple models of chemical\nevolution with IRA. The chemical evolution of galaxies is a complex phenomenon that can be properly treated only by means of\ndetailed numerical codes, possibly taking into account also the\nhydrodynamical evolution of the system, as we have explained\nabove. However, in spite of the oversimplifications introduced\nby simple chemical evolution models, the results they produce\nare very linear and simple to interpret. They can therefore illustrate in a direct way the effect of differential winds on the chemical evolution of galaxies, as well as the effect of relaxing IRA.\nMoreover, for clarity purposes, we show also the results of detailed numerical models (Lanfranchi & Matteucci 2003; 2004)\nas a comparison.\nThe plan of the paper is as follows: in Sect. 2 we summarize the assumptions of the simple models of chemical evolution\nand the results of models including gas flows (infall and outflow). In Sect. 3 we introduce the assumptions necessary to solve\nthe equations of chemical evolution of galaxies with differential\nwinds and produce some illustrative result. In Sect. 4 we study\nthe abundance ratios of some chemical elements predicted by\nmodels with differential and selective winds. Finally, we discuss\nsome implications of the results and draw the main conclusions\nin Sect. 5.\n\n5. Stars more massive than 1 M\u2299 die instantaneously; stars\nsmaller than 1 M\u2299 live forever (instantaneous recycling approximation or IRA).\nThese simplifying assumptions allow us to calculate analytically\nthe chemical evolution of the galaxies. Once we have defined the\nfundamental quantities:\nR=\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n(m \u2212 MR )\u03c6(m)dm,\n\n(1)\n\n1\n\n(where \u03c6(m) is the IMF and MR is the mass of the remnant) and\nyZ =\n\n1\n1\u2212R\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nmpZ,m \u03c6(m)dm,\n\n(2)\n\n1\n\n(where pZ,m is the fraction of newly produced and ejected metals\nby a star of mass m), the well known solution of the closed box\nmodel can be easily found:\nZ = yZ ln(\u03bc\u22121 ),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03bc is the gas fraction Mg /Mtot . This result is obtained by\nassuming that the galaxy initially contains only gas and has\nthe remarkable property that it does not depend on the particular star formation history the galaxy experiences. To obtain eq.\n(3) one has to assume that yZ does not depend on metallicity.\nNucleosynthesis can indeed depend on metallicity, especially for\nsecondary elements. However, for O and Fe the metallicity effect\nis not so important (Matteucci 2001; Garnett 2002), therefore we\ncan neglect it for the purposes of our work. In the general case\nin which yZ = f (Z) the evolution of the metallicity is governed\nby the following equation:\nZ\n\n0\n\nZ\n\ndw\n= ln(\u03bc\u22121 ).\nf (w)\n\n(4)\n\nRelaxing the first of the assumptions of the simple model,\nwe get the models including gas flows, also known as leaky box\nmodels. Analytical solutions of simple models of chemical evolution including infall or outflow are known since at least 30\nyears (Pagel & Patchett 1975; Hartwick 1976; Twarog 1980;\nEdmunds 1990). Here we follow the approach and the terminology of Tinsley (1980) and Matteucci (2001), namely we assume\nfor simplicity linear flows (we assume gas flows proportional to\nthe star formation rate (SFR)). Therefore, the outflow rate W(t)\nis given by:\nW(t) = \u03bb(1 \u2212 R)\u03c8(t),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03c8(t) is the SFR, and the infall rate A(t) is given by:\n\n2. Summary of simple model containing gas flows\n2.1. Standard solutions\n\nAs it is well known, the so-called Simple Model of chemical evolution is based on the following assumptions:\n1. the system is one-zone and closed, namely there are no inflows or outflows.\n2. The initial gas is primordial (no metals).\n3. The IMF is constant in time.\n4. The gas is well mixed at any time (instantaneous mixing).\n\nA(t) = \u039b(1 \u2212 R)\u03c8(t).\n\n(6)\n\nHere \u03bb and \u039b are two proportionality constants. The first assumption is justified by the fact that, the larger the SFR is, the\nmore intense are the energetic events associated with it (in particular supernova explosions and stellar winds), therefore the larger\nis the chance of having a large-scale outflow (see e.g. Silk 2003).\nA proportionality between A(t) and \u03c8(t) can be instead justified\nby the fact that the infall of gas provides a continuous reservoir\nfor the star formation. A careful analysis of this assumption is\ngiven in Sect. 3.4.\n\n\fSimone Recchi et al.: Differential winds and chemical evolution of galaxies\n\nFig. 1. Evolution of the metallicity as a function of \u03bc for the\nclosed box model (solid line) and models with gas flows: \u03bb = 2\nand \u039b = 0 (dotted line); \u03bb = 0 and \u039b = 2 (short-dashed line);\n\u03bb = 3 and \u039b = 1 (long-dashed line); \u03bb = 1 and \u039b = 3 (dotdashed line). The metallicity of the infalling gas ZA is assumed\nto be 0.\nThe system of equations we need to solve is therefore:\n\uf8f1 dMtot\n\uf8f4\n= (\u039b \u2212 \u03bb)(1 \u2212 R)\u03c8(t)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 dMdtg\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\ndt = (\u039b \u2212 \u03bb \u2212 1)(1 \u2212 R)\u03c8(t)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 dMZ = (1 \u2212 R)\u03c8(t)[\u039bZ + y \u2212 (\u03bb + 1)Z]\nA\nZ\ndt\n\n(7)\n\nwhere MZ is the mass of metals (MZ = Z * Mg ) and ZA is the\nmetallicity of the infalling gas. For the moment, ZA is assumed\nto be a constant, although it could change with time due to the\npollution of the intracluster medium (ICM) by means of the metals ejected through the galactic winds. This aspect will be considered in detail in Sect. 3.2 and Sect. 3.3. With some algebra,\nthis set of equations can be worked out, yielding:\n(\ni \u039b )\nh\n\u039bZA + yZ\n\u22121 \u039b\u2212\u03bb\u22121\n.\n(8)\n1 \u2212 (\u039b \u2212 \u03bb) \u2212 (\u039b \u2212 \u03bb \u2212 1)\u03bc\nZ=\n\u039b\nTo find this solution we have made use of the initial conditions\nZ(0) = 0, Mg (0) = Mtot (0) = Mg,0 . It is worth pointing out\nthat the explicit dependence of Z on time is hidden in the time\ndependence of \u03bc (see also Sect. 3.4).\nWe show in Fig. 1 the evolution of Z/yZ versus \u03bc in the case\nZA = 0 for different values of \u03bb and \u039b. It is worth reminding\nthat \u03bc = 1 at the beginning of the evolution of the galaxy and its\nvalue decreases with time. Therefore, the time axis is inverted\ncompared to the \u03bc-axis in this figure and in similar ones. We\ncan see that all the models with gas flows produce metallicities smaller than the ones predicted by the closed box model\n(solid line). This is in agreement with the first and the third of\nEdmund's theorems (Edmunds 1990), since we have assumed\nthat the infall gas is pristine (ZA = 0). Fig. 2 shows the effective\nyields ye f f = Z/ ln(\u03bc\u22121 ) (normalized to yZ ) of the same models\n\n3\n\nFig. 2. Normalized effective yield as a function of \u03bc. Notation\nas in Fig. 1\npresented in Fig 1. ye f f is often used in literature to interpret data\nand to analyze to what extent the chemical evolution of a galaxy\ndeviates from the behavior predicted by the closed box model\n(Garnett 2002; Tremonti et al. 2004). We can notice from eq.\n(8) that the solution diverges for models in which \u03bb > \u039b when\n\u03bc approaches 0, therefore, we show Z/yZ and ye f f /yZ versus \u03bc\nonly until \u03bc \u223c 0.1. Indeed, Prantzos & Aubert (1995) pointed\nout that IRA cannot be applied in situations in which low \u03bc are\nobtained, because the amount of gas ejected by low mass stars\nat late times can substantially modify the final abundances, also\nfor elements produced on short timescales by massive stars. We\nnotice here also that, in models in which the infall rate is larger\nthan the outflow rate, not all the values of \u03bc are allowed. Solving\nthe first two equations of the system (7), we get:\n\u03bc=\n\n\u039b\u2212\u03bb\u22121\n1 Mg,0\n.\n+\n\u039b\u2212\u03bb\n\u039b \u2212 \u03bb Mg\n\n(9)\n\nIn the models in which \u039b > \u03bb + 1, Mg is always increasing (eq.\n7), therefore \u03bc ranges between 1 and a minimum value:\n\u03bcmin =\n\n\u039b\u2212\u03bb\u22121\n.\n\u039b\u2212\u03bb\n\n(10)\n\nFor models in which \u03bb + 1 > \u039b > \u03bb there is no \u03bcmin but there\nis a upper limit reachable by the gas mass which is given by\nMg,lim = Mg,0 /(\u03bb + 1 \u2212 \u039b). For this reason we plotted in Figs. 1\nand 2 the model with \u03bb = 0 and \u039b = 2 (short-dashed line) and\nthe model with \u03bb = 1 and \u039b = 3 (dot-dashed line) only for\n\u03bc \u2265 \u03bcmin = 0.5.\n\n3. Simple models with differential winds\n3.1. The basic solution\n\nWe present in this section the chemical evolution of galaxies in\nwhich a differential wind is assumed, namely in which the metals are more easily channelled out of the parent galaxy than the\n\n\f4\n\nSimone Recchi et al.: Differential winds and chemical evolution of galaxies\n\npristine gas. The easiest way to consider a differential wind in the\nframework of simple models of chemical evolution is to assume\nthat the metallicity of the gas carried out in the galactic wind is\nproportional to the metallicity of the ISM with a proportionality constant larger than one. If we define Z o as the metallicity of\nthe outflowing gas, this condition implies that Z o = \u03b1Z with the\nejection efficiency \u03b1 > 1. In the metallicity budget (third equation in (7)) we have to assume that the negative term due to the\ngalactic wind is given by W(t)Z o = \u03b1\u03bb(1 \u2212 R)\u03c8(t). A similar approach has been used by Salvadori et al. (2008) but in the framework of a semi-analytical model for the evolution of galaxies.\nWith our simple approach we are able to determine analytical\nexpressions for the evolution of Z, which allow us to understand\nmore clearly the effect of galactic winds on the chemical evolution of galaxies.\nThe set of the equations we have to solve in this case is very\nsimilar to (7), with the only difference given by the metallicity\nbudget equation, which we modify as follows:\ndMZ\n= (1 \u2212 R)\u03c8(t)[\u039bZA + yZ \u2212 (\u03bb\u03b1 + 1)Z].\ndt\n\n(11)\n\nThe solution of this new set of equations is given by:\nZ=\n\n(\ni \u039b+(\u03b1\u22121)\u03bb )\nh\n\u039bZA + yZ\n1 \u2212 (\u039b \u2212 \u03bb) \u2212 (\u039b \u2212 \u03bb \u2212 1)\u03bc\u22121 \u039b\u2212\u03bb\u22121 . (12)\n\u039b + (\u03b1 \u2212 1)\u03bb\n\nIt is straightforward to see that we can obtain eq. (8) in the case\n\u03b1 = 1 (i.e. in the case in which the galactic wind is not differential). We remind here that this solution is valid only for primary elements. The evolution of secondary elements (namely elements synthesized from the metals present in the stars at birth)\nin the framework of simple models with gas flows has been extensively studied by K\u00f6ppen & Edmunds (1999) and we refer\nthe reader to this paper to find out more about it.\nAssuming again for simplicity an infall of pristine gas (i.e.\nZA = 0) we can see how the chemical evolution of the galaxy\nvaries with the ejection efficiency \u03b1. In Figs. 3 and 4 we show\nZ/yZ vs. \u03bc for different values of \u03b1 and gas flow parameters (\u03bb,\n\u039b) taken as (3, 1) and (1, 3), respectively. The first couple of values can be attributed to objects in which galactic winds have a\nprominent role. This is usually the case in dwarf galaxies, since\nthe potential well of these objects is very shallow and large-scale\noutflows must be common (Dekel & Silk 1986, but see also\nSkillman 1997). The second set of parameters (\u03bb = 1, \u039b = 3)\ncan more properly refer to spiral galaxies, although large outflow episodes in massive spirals are not very likely. In general,\nthe effect of differential winds can be more clearly distinguished\nin models in which the outflow is prominent compared to the infall. For this reason, we will pay from now on more attention on\nthe models for which \u03bb > \u039b, taking \u03bb = 3, \u039b = 1 as reference\nvalues. Our aim in this paper is not to describe a prototypical\ndwarf galaxy, therefore the combination of parameters (\u03bb, \u039b) =\n(3, 1) is purely indicative and serves as a benchmark of our models with differential winds.\nAs expected, the differential wind determines a significant\nreduction of the metallicity of the galaxy. It can be shown analytically that, for each value of \u03b1 > 1, eq. (12) produces metallicities systematically smaller that the ones obtained from eq.\n(8). Moreover, it is evident from these plots the asymptotic trend\nof Z/yZ as \u03bc approaches 0 or \u03bcmin . From eq. (12) it is easy to\nsee that, in both cases, Z/yZ asymptotically tends to the value\n[(\u03b1 \u2212 1)\u03bb + \u039b]\u22121 provided that ZA = 0, therefore Z/yZ decreases\nalmost linearly with \u03b1 when \u03bc is small and \u03b1 \u226b 1.\n\nFig. 3.

Plotted\nare models with the differential wind parameter \u03b1 = 2 (dotted\nline), 5 (short-dashed line), 10 (long-dashed line) and 50 (dotdashed line). For reference, also the model with \u03b1 = 1 (normal\nwind) is plotted (solid line).\n\nFig. 4. As in Fig. 3 but for \u03bb = 1 and \u039b = 3\n.\n\n3.2. Instantaneous ICM mixing models\n\nIn our calculations we have so far assumed that the metallicity\nof the infalling gas ZA is constant in time. This assumption is not\nnecessarily true, in particular when differential winds are taken\ninto account. In fact, the galactic winds can pollute the surround-\n\n\fSimone Recchi et al.: Differential winds and chemical evolution of galaxies\n\ning medium and the infalling gas can have a metallicity increasing with time. The increase of the iron abundance between redshift z \u223c 1 and z \u223c 0 in the ICM has been recently suggested\n(Balestra et al. 2007) and can be accounted for in numerical\nmodels in which the chemical evolution of the ICM is affected by\ngalactic winds and stripping (Calura et al. 2007). A simple hypothesis we can make about the variation of the ICM metallicity\nwith time is that the metals, expelled out of the galaxy through\ngalactic winds, instantaneously and uniformly mix with the surrounding ICM. This approach has been used by detailed chemical evolution models of the ICM (e.g. Matteucci & Vettolani\n1988; Moretti et al. 2003). Of course the instantaneous mixing\nof the outflowing gas with the whole ICM is rather unlikely.\nNevertheless, this assumption is useful for illustrative purposes.\nThis hypothesis leads to a new set of equations in which, besides ZA , we have to consider also the variation, although small,\nof the ICM mass MICM due to galactic winds and infall. These 4\nequations are:\n\uf8f1 dMg\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\ndt = (\u039b \u2212 \u03bb \u2212 1)(1 \u2212 R)\u03c8(t)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\ndMZ\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 dt = (1 \u2212 R)\u03c8(t)[\u039bZA + yZ \u2212 (\u03bb\u03b1 + 1)Z]\n(13)\n\uf8f4\ndMZA\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n= (1 \u2212 R)\u03c8(t)[\u03bb\u03b1Z \u2212 \u039bZA ]\n\uf8f4\ndt\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 dMICM\n= (1 \u2212 R)\u03c8(t)(\u03bb \u2212 \u039b),\ndt\n\nwhere MZA is the mass of metals in the ICM (MZA = ZA * MICM ).\nIn order to solve this set of equations we have to define the ratio between gas mass and ICM mass \u03b7 = Mg /MICM and a new\nparameter k = Mg,0 /MICM (0), where MICM (0) is the initial ICM\nmass. Once we have defined the values Xa and Xb such that:\nXa\u22121 =\n\n\u03bb\u2212\u039b\n\u039b\u2212\u03bb\u22121\n\u03b7\u2212\n,\n(k + 1)(\u03bb \u2212 \u039b) + 1\n(k + 1)(\u03bb \u2212 \u039b) + 1\n\n(14)\n\nk(\u039b \u2212 \u03bb \u2212 1)\nk(\u03bb \u2212 \u039b)\n\u2212\n\u03b7\u22121 ,\n(k + 1)(\u03bb \u2212 \u039b) + 1 (k + 1)(\u03bb \u2212 \u039b) + 1\n\n(15)\n\nand\nXb\u22121 =\n\nthe solution of the system of equations (13) is given by:\nZ=\n\nyZ\n\u03bb\n\n\u039b\u03b1Xa\u039b\u2212\u03bb \u2212 (\u039b \u2212 \u03bb)(\u03b1 \u2212 1)\n\n\u03bb\n#\n\"\n\u039b\u03b1Xa\u039b\u2212\u03bb \u2212(\u039b\u2212\u03bb)(\u03b1\u22121)\n\u2212\n\u039b\u2212\u03bb\u22121\n.\n1 \u2212 Xb\n\n(16)\n\nIt is straightforward to see that eqs (16) and (12) produce the\nsame results if the infall is negligible (i.e. if \u039b \u223c 0). Considering\nagain a model with \u039b = 1 and \u03bb = 3 we can show the trend of\nZ/yZ in the case \u03b1 = 5 for different values of k. We notice first\nthat, unlike \u03bc, \u03b7 does not monotonically decrease, but its variation depends on the values of \u03bb and \u039b. In the present example,\nsince \u03bb > \u039b, Mg decreases with time and MICM increases with\ntime, therefore \u03b7 ranges between k at the beginning and 0 during\nthe late stages of the evolution of the galaxy. We show in Fig. 5\nthe evolution of Z/yZ as a function of \u03b7/k for k = 0.1 (solid line)\nand k = 0.5 (dotted line). The model with k = 0.5 predicts larger\nabundances because the metals carried out by the galactic wind\nare diluted with less ICM, therefore ZA is larger. These results\ncannot be compared to the results of eq. (12) in a straightforward\nmanner since they are expressed in different units. However, we\nshow in this plot the asymptotic trend of the simple differential\nwind model (short-dashed line in Fig. 3) for \u03bc approaching 0\n(dashed line). This comparison allows us to notice that, as expected, eq. (16) predicts larger metallicities compared to models\nwith ZA = 0. However, as long as k < 1, the differences are small\n(of the order of \u223c 0.1 - 0.2 dex).\n\n5\n\nFig. 5. Chemical evolution of models in which the metallicity\nof the ICM varies with time (instantaneous ICM mixing models)\nand with initial mass ratio k (see text) equal to 0.1 (solid line)\nand 0.5 (dotted line). Also shown in this plot is the asymptotic\ntrend of the simple differential wind model for \u03bc approaching 0\n(dashed line). For all models, \u03bb = 3, \u039b = 1 and \u03b1 = 5.\nWe can also calculate the ICM metallicity, which turns out\nto be:\n\u0010\n\u03bb \u0011\nZA = \u03b1Z 1 \u2212 Xa\u039b\u2212\u03bb .\n(17)\nIn the case we are considering more closely, \u03bb = 3 and \u039b = 1,\ntherefore the ICM mass increases with time and Xa ranges between 1 and (1+k). The larger value ZA /Z can attain is therefore:\n#\n\"\n\u03bb\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u039b\u2212\u03bb\nZA\n,\n(18)\n=\u03b1 1\u2212 1+k\nZ\nwhich is smaller than 1 provided that:\nk < klim\n\n\"\n\n\u03b1\n=\n\u03b1\u22121\n\n# \u03bb\u2212\u039b\n\u03bb\n\n\u2212 1.\n\n(19)\n\nOnce the ratio ZA /Z between ICM and ISM metallicity is observationally known, eq. (18) can be used to constrain \u03b1.\n3.3. Galactic fountain models\n\nA special case of variable infall metallicity is represented by the\nsituation in which ZA = Z o = \u03b1Z, namely the metallicity of the\ninfalling gas is set to be always equal to the one of the galactic wind. This condition implies therefore that the very same gas\nthat has been driven out of the galaxy by energetic events can\nsubsequently rain back to the galaxy, due to the pull of its gravitational potential. This kind of duty cycle is well known in astrophysics and it has been named galactic fountain (Shapiro &\nField 1976; Bregman 1980). In order to solve the chemical evolution in this special case, we have necessarily to assume that\n\n\f6\n\nSimone Recchi et al.: Differential winds and chemical evolution of galaxies\n\nof this delay on the chemical evolution of galaxies (Spitoni et al.\n2008, in preparation).\n3.4. Limits of the approximations of linear flows\n\nFig. 6. Comparison of the chemical evolution of a galactic fountain model (solid line) with a model with infall of pristine gas\n(ZA = 0, dotted line). For both models, \u03bb = 3, \u039b = 1 and \u03b1 = 5.\n\u03bb \u2265 \u039b since the reservoir for the infall gas is given by the gas\nexpelled out of the galaxy through galactic winds. The solution\nof the chemical evolution in the presence of galactic fountains is\ngiven by:\n( h\ni (\u03bb\u2212\u039b)(\u03b1\u22121) )\nyZ\n\u22121 \u039b\u2212\u03bb\u22121\n.(20)\n1 \u2212 (\u039b \u2212 \u03bb) \u2212 (\u039b \u2212 \u03bb \u2212 1)\u03bc\nZ=\n(\u03bb \u2212 \u039b)(\u03b1 \u2212 1)\nA comparison of this solution with the solution of eq. (12)\nwith infall of pristine gas (ZA = 0) is shown in Fig. 6. For\nboth models plotted in this figure we have assumed \u03bb = 3,\n\u039b = 1 and \u03b1 = 5. As expected, the galactic fountain model\npredicts larger vales of Z. These values exceed also the metallicities attained by the models with instantaneous mixing of the\nICM (Sect. 3.3) shown in Fig. 5. This result is expected because the galactic fountain model maximizes the enrichment in\nmetallicity of the infalling gas, whereas in the models shown\nin Sect. 3.3 the metals escaping from the galaxy are diluted in\na large amount of ICM. From eqs. (12) and (20) we can also\nnotice that the metallicity ratio tends asymptotically to the value\n[(\u03b1\u22121)\u03bb+\u039b]/[(\u03bb\u2212\u039b)(\u03b1\u22121)] which is always larger than one (for\nthe special choice of parameters it is equal to 13/8) but it tends\nto 1 for \u03b1 \u226b 1. In our example, only an infall of pre-enriched\ngas, whose metallicity is larger than 5/8 yZ can therefore produce a metallicity in the galaxy larger than the one attained by\nthe galactic fountain model. From eq. (20) we can also see that,\nin the special case in which \u03bb = \u039b, Z/yZ tends to the solution of\nthe closed box model (eq. 3). This is due to the fact that, in the\nframework of the simple models of chemical evolution, having\noutflow and infall with the same rate and metallicity or not having gas flows at all is formally the same. Indeed, the fountains\ntake a finite and non-negligible time to orbit around and fall back\nto the galaxy (Spitoni et al. 2008). This implies a delay in the\nmixing of metals in the ISM, which conflicts with the fourth assumption of the simple models of chemical evolution (Sect. 2),\ntherefore only detailed numerical models can ascertain the effect\n\nIn the previous sections we have assumed that both outflow and\ninfall rates are proportional to the SFR and we have seen that in\nthis way we obtain solutions in which \u03c8(t) cancels out. In this\nsection we analyze how reliable are these assumptions and what\nkind of results we obtain if we assume general infall and outflow\nlaws (see also Edmunds 1990; K\u00f6ppen & Edmunds 1999). First\nof all we notice that a correlation between infall rate and SFR\narises naturally because the larger is the amount of infalling gas,\nthe higher is the reservoir of gas inside the galaxy available to\nform stars. An example is given by detailed models of the chemical evolution of the Milky Way (Chiappini et al. 1997; Cescutti\net al. 2007; Colavitti et al. 2008) in which two main phases of\ngas infall turn out to produce two distinct episodes of star formation (although the similar behavior between the two rates does\nnot imply that their ratio is constant). We will show in this section that, under reasonable assumptions, a constant ratio between\nSFR and infall rate can be attained during the late evolution of\nthe considered galaxies. On the other hand, a proportionality between the outflow rate and the SFR is quite realistic and it has\nbeen shown both observationally (e.g. Heckman 2002) and theoretically (e.g. Silk 2003).\nTherefore, let us assume for simplicity that eq. (5) still holds\nand that the infalling gas is pristine (e.g. ZA = 0). The extension\nof our calculations to the case in which W(t) is a generic function\nis straightforward. If we assume a generic infall law A(t), the\nsystem of equations we need to solve is:\n\uf8f1 dMtot\n\uf8f4\n= A(t) \u2212 \u03bb(1 \u2212 R)\u03c8(t)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 dMdtg\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\ndt = A(t) \u2212 (\u03bb + 1)(1 \u2212 R)\u03c8(t)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 dMZ = (1 \u2212 R)\u03c8(t)[y \u2212 (\u03b1\u03bb + 1)Z(t)],\nZ\ndt\n\n(21)\n\nsubject to the usual initial conditions Z(0) = 0, Mg (0) =\nMtot (0) = Mg,0 . In this case, however, it is not possible to solve\nthis system of equations canceling out \u03c8(t). Therefore, at variance with what we have done so far, we must assume some\ndependence of \u03c8(t) on Mg (Schmidt law). We assume a linear\nSchmidt law (e.g. \u03c8(t) = S Mg (t)), because it is the only formulation for which the results can be expressed analytically. For\nSchmidt laws with different exponents detailed numerical models are required. The equation for the evolution of the gas mass\ncan be simply solved, yielding:\n#\n\"Z t\n(22)\nMg (t) = e\u2212(\u03bb+1)(1\u2212R)S t\nA(u)e(\u03bb+1)(1\u2212R)S u du + Mg,0 .\n0\n\nSubstituting this expression into the third equation of the system\n(21) also the evolution of the metallicity as a function of time\ncan be calculated. The result is the following:\nh i\u22121 Z t\nZ(t) = (1 \u2212 R)S yZ I(t)\nI(u)du,\n(23)\n0\n\nwhere\nI(t) = e\n\n\u03bb(1\u2212R)S (\u03b1\u22121)t+\n\n(\u03bb+1)(1\u2212R)S u\nA(u)e\nR\ndu\no Mg,0 + u A(v)e(\u03bb+1)(1\u2212R)S v dv\n0\n\nRt\n\n.\n\n(24)\n\nWe consider now as an example an exponential infall law,\nstudy what kind of metallicity evolution it produces and compare\n\n\fSimone Recchi et al.: Differential winds and chemical evolution of galaxies\n\n7\n\nthe results with those presented in Sect. 3.1, bearing in mind that,\nin the present case, we have to define the value of some constants\n(Mg,0 , S as well as the constants defining the infall rate), whereas\nin the previous case it was enough to define the proportionality\nconstant \u039b. We have:\nA(t) = Ke\u2212t/ti = Ke\u2212\u03c4 ,\n\n(25)\n\nwhere ti is a characteristic infall timescale and \u03c4 = t/ti . We can\ncalculate K assuming that the initial gas mass Mg,0 is proportional to the total amount of infalling gas throughRa proportion\u221e\nality constant \u03b3 (namely we assume that Mg,0 = \u03b3 0 A(t)dt). In\nthis way, we obtain K =\nMg (\u03c4) =\n\nMg,0\n\u03b3ti .\n\nEq. (22) can be therefore solved:\n\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\uf8fa\nMg,0 \uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef \u2212\u03c4\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0e + K1 e\u2212(\u03bb+1)(1\u2212R)S ti \u03c4 \uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb,\nK1\n\n(26)\n\nwhere K1 is a constant (see the appendix for its exact value).\nA(t)\nWe can now evaluate the ratio \u039b(t) = (1\u2212R)\u03c8(t)\nin order to test\nif and under which conditions we can still assume a proportionality between the SFR and the infall rate A(t). In Fig. 7 we show\nthe resulting \u039b(t) for different values of \u03b3 (0.2, 1 and 5) and ti (1,\n1.5 and 5 Gyr). In order to draw these curves we have assumed\n\u03bb = 3 (in agreement with what assumed in Sect. 3.1) and S = 1\nGyr\u22121 . This is an upper limit for the star formation efficiency\nin dwarf galaxies (see. e.g. Lanfranchi & Matteucci 2003). R\nis assumed to be 0.26, in agreements with the nucleosynthetic\ncalculations of Woosley & Weaver (1995) assuming a Salpeter\nIMF. A small value of \u03b3 implies that the galaxy initially does\nnot have a large amount of gas and the star formation is mostly\ntriggered by the infalling gas, therefore the infall rate initially\nprevails over the SFR. A large ti implies a large infall rate at\nlate times, therefore \u039b(t) tends asymptotically to a large value.\nIn general the behavior of \u039b(t) depends on a complex interplay\nbetween \u03b3, ti , S and \u03bb (see also K\u00f6ppen & Edmunds 1999) but\nwe can see that under reasonable assumptions the models show a\nfirst phase (lasting a few Gyr) in which \u039b(t) varies with time, but\nthen it stabilizes to a constant value. As a general result, only if\nwe assume infall timescales much shorter than the star formation\ntimescale (i.e. the inverse of S ) \u039b(t) shows significant variations\nover the whole evolution of the galaxy, although these variations\nare milder if a large value of \u03bb is assumed. For instance, if we\ntake S = 0.1 Gyr\u22121 , a constant \u039b(t) is attained by assuming either large values of \u03bb or large values of ti or values of \u03b3 such\nthat K1 \u223c 0. If we assume a quadratic Schmidt law, the infall\ntimescales required to obtain a constant \u039b(t) tend to be larger\nthan in the case of a linear Schmidt law. We can conclude that a\nlinear flow can be a reasonable approximation of the late evolution of a galaxy provided that the infall timescale is of the same\norder of magnitude of the star formation timescale.\nNow we can answer the following question: does an early\nphase of variable \u039b(t) significantly affect the evolution of the\nmetallicity? To do that we have to solve eq. (23). The resulting\nevolution of Z/yZ is given by:\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u2212E \u03c4\nE \u03c4\nZ(\u03c4) K2 + K3 e 1 \u2212 K2 + K3 e 2\n=\n,\n(27)\nyZ\neE1 \u03c4 + K1\n(see the Appendix for the expressions of the involved constants).\nWe show in Fig. 8 the evolution of Z(t)/yZ as a function of\ntime for different values of \u03b3. In these models we assume ti = 1.5\nGyr because this value leads to a \u039b close to 1 (see Fig. 7). To\ncompare these models with the results shown in Sect. 3.1 we\n\nFig. 7.

Therefore\nwe can conclude that the results we have shown in Sect. 3.1 do\nnot change substantially if we assume an exponential infall instead of an infall rate proportional to the SFR. This demonstrates\nalso that the major source of error in the solutions of the simple\nmodels is the IRA assumption rather than the assumption of linear flows.\n\n4. The abundance ratios\nFrom eq. (12) it is straightforward to determine the abundance\nratio between two chemical elements i and j assuming that the\nyields do not depend on metallicity (see also Sect. 2), namely:\nyi + \u039bZA,i\nZi\n=\n.\nZ j y j + \u039bZA, j\n\n(29)\n\nThis abundance ratio is therefore determined uniquely by constants which depend on the IMF and on the properties of the\ninfalling gas. In the models with variable infall metallicities,\nZi /Z j is simply given by the yields ratio yi /y j (see eqs. 16 and\n20). With our simplifying assumptions, the abundance ratio must\n\n\f8\n\nSimone Recchi et al.: Differential winds and chemical evolution of galaxies\n\nFig. 8.

For all models \u03b1 = 5.\n\nremain constant throughout the whole evolution of the galaxy.\nAlso the abundance ratios of the ICM (see eq. 17) must remain constant with \u03b7 (and therefore with time). The constancy of\nabundance ratios in the framework of simple models of chemical evolution was also pointed out by Matteucci & Chiappini\n(2005), in which the authors showed that variations of the abundance ratios can be accounted for only by relaxing the IRA and\nby properly taking into account stellar lifetimes. Here we outline\nthat this result holds also if we consider differential winds.\nBy neglecting the contribution of SNeIa, it is expected that\nthe [O/Fe] ratio does not change with time (and therefore with\n[Fe/H]) since, in this case, both elements are produced by SNeII,\non similar timescales. Indeed, detailed models of the evolution\nof the Galaxy (Chiappini et al. 1997) show a mild decrease of\nthe predicted (and observed) [O/Fe] as a function of [Fe/H] even\nwithout considering SNeIa, due to the variation of the yields with\nstellar mass, but this can account for only \u223c 0.2 dex of the [O/Fe]\nvariation. A much more significant reduction of the [O/Fe] can\nbe attained by taking into consideration SNeIa, which provide\nmost of the Fe of the ISM and explode with a delay compared to\nthe SNeII. This model (also called time-delay model) remains the\nmost plausible explanation of the variation of [O/Fe] vs. [Fe/H]\nin various galaxies (Matteucci & Greggio 1986; Lanfranchi &\nMatteucci 2003). In particular, Lanfranchi & Matteucci (2003)\ninterpreted the steep decline of the [\u03b1/Fe] ratios at low [Fe/H] (at\n[Fe/H] \u223c -1.6 dex), observed in dwarf spheroidals of the Local\nGroup (e.g. Shetrone et al. 2001, Venn et al. 2004) as due to the\nslow SFR acting in these systems, coupled with very efficient\ngalactic winds. In this situation, in fact, the Fe production from\nType Ia SNe occurs when the [Fe/H] is still low. At this point, the\ngalactic winds extract both \u03b1-elements and Fe from the galaxy\nbut while O is less and less produced because of the decrease\n\nin the star formation due to the wind, Fe continues to be produced by Type Ia SNe. Unfortunately, SNeIa cannot be treated\nby means of simple model (SNeIa arise from CO white dwarfs\nin binary stars, with non-negligible lifetimes, therefore the IRA\ncannot be applied). Because of that, it is not possible to solve analytically chemical evolution equations which include SNeIa and\nthis is the reason why most people make use of numerical simulations. However, IRA provides a good approximation of the\nevolution of \u03b1 elements, promptly released by SNeII. Recently,\nSavadori et al. (2008) proposed an alternative scenario in which\nthe drop in the [O/Fe] is due to strong differential winds, combined with the relaxation of the IRA, without invoking SNeIa.\nIn their model, the star formation is dominated by an early, very\nshort (\u223c 100 Myr) burst. However, a non-negligible fraction\nof SNeIa seems to appear also within 0.1 Gyr in galaxies (see\nMannucci et al. 2005; 2006), therefore neglecting SNeIa in their\nmodel could be incorrect. This might be the reason why these\nauthors do not reproduce accurately the high metallicity tail of\nthe metallicity distribution function of Sculptor (namely the stars\nwith [Fe/H] \u223c \u22121; see their figs. 4 and 6). On the other hand, neglecting Type Ia SNe appears consistent with the stellar lifetimes\nthey have assumed. These lifetimes predict 150 Myr for a 8 M\u2299\nstar, instead of 30\u201340 Myr as commonly adopted. These long\nlifetimes, together with the short duration of the main episode\nof SF and the relaxation of IRA help in producing the decrease\nof [O/Fe] since in this case the evolution of abundance ratios resembles that of an instantaneous burst in which the [O/Fe] at a\ngiven time t follows the ratio of O and Fe yields of the star dying\nat that time.\nOne way to attain a variable [O/Fe] ratio in the framework\nof simple models of chemical evolution is by assuming selective\nwinds, namely that the two elements have different ejection efficiencies. It has been suggested since a long time that \u03b1-elements\ncan be channelled out of a galaxy more easily than other elements (Marconi et al. 1994; Martin et al. 2002) but Recchi et al.\n(2001) showed that, during the very first burst of star formation\nexperienced by a dwarf galaxy, iron can be expelled more easily\nthan oxygen. The hypothesis of different ejection efficiencies \u03b1\nfor O and Fe is therefore a reasonable assumption that can be\ntested by our models.\nWe assume two different values for these ejection efficiencies\n\u03b1O and \u03b1Fe and, by means of eq. (12), we calculate how [O/Fe]\nvaries with [Fe/H]. The results would not change significantly\nif we assume eqs. (16) or eq. (20) instead of eq. (12). In Fig. 9\nwe show for instance the comparisons of models for which (\u03b1O ,\n\u03b1Fe ) = (5, 2) (solid line), (2, 5) (dotted line) and (2, 2) (dashed\nline). We show the results for our reference set of parameters\n(\u03bb = 3 and \u039b = 1) in the left panel. To study the dependence of\nthese curves on the inflow and outflow parameters, we also plot\nthe results for \u03bb = 1 and \u039b = 3 (right panel). In order to calculate\nthe yields, we have assumed a Salpeter IMF between 0.1 and 40\nM\u2299 and the nucleosynthetic prescriptions of Woosley & Weaver\n(1995) for solar metallicity (case B). For the solar abundances\nwe adopt the Anders & Grevesse (1989) values. We use this set\nof solar abundances in order to be consistent with the choice of\nWoosley & Weaver's (1995) yields.\nAs expected, as the galaxy ages (and, therefore, [Fe/H] increases), [O/Fe] bends down if the oxygen ejection efficiency is\nlarger (solid line), whereas it starts increasing if \u03b1Fe > \u03b1O (dotted line). The model with \u03bb = 1 and \u039b = 3 shows the same\nbehavior but with reduced variations of the abundance ratios.\nThis is due to the fact that the difference between the metallicities attained for \u03b1 = 2 and \u03b1 = 5 in the case (\u03bb, \u039b) = (3, 1)\nis larger than in the case (\u03bb, \u039b) = (1, 3) (see Figs. 3 and 4).

The [O/Fe] attained by this model (\u223c 0.2) is lower\nthan the [O/Fe] of halo stars and of the most metal-poor stars of\nLocal Group dwarf galaxies, whose chemical enrichment should\nhave been dominated by SNeII ejecta. Indeed, it is known since\nquite some time that Woosley & Weaver's yields overpredict iron\n(Timmes et al. 1995; Chiappini et al. 1997). As we have said,\nthe model with \u03bb = 3 and \u039b = 1 can be representative of dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies. Indeed, in this model the metallicity remains\nsignificantly lower than the solar value and, if O is ejected more\neasily than Fe, a knee at [Fe/H] \u223c -1.5 appears, in agreement\nwith observations (see e.g. Venn et al. 2004). We point out once\nmore that we are neglecting SNeIa therefore, in the framework\nof simple models, O and Fe are both produced by massive stars,\non similar timescales. As a consequence, they should share a\nsimilar fate and have comparable ejection efficiencies. Recchi et\nal. (2004), by means of detailed chemodynamical simulations,\nfound similar values of \u03b1O and \u03b1Fe when complex star formation histories are assumed. Therefore, simple models predict that\nvariations in the [O/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] plot cannot be attributed to\ndifferential winds and SNeIa must necessarily be considered in\norder to properly interpret this diagram.\nWould this conclusion still hold if we relax IRA and take\nproperly into account stellar lifetimes? In order to test that, we\nhave performed a series of numerical simulations of the chemical evolution of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy whose structural parameters resemble those of Local Group such as Carina, Draco,\nUrsa Minor, Sculptor. In particular we have run a simulation\nvery similar to the \"standard\" model of Lanfranchi & Matteucci\n(2003). The standard model is adjusted to reproduce the average\n[\u03b1/Fe] and neutron capture abundance ratios of six local dwarf\nspheroidals. It is assumed that the galaxy forms through the fast\nand continuous infall of pristine gas until a mass of \u223c 108 M\u2299 is\n\nFig. 10.

For clarity purposes,\nthe dot-short-dashed line has been shifted of 0.01 dex since otherwise it would have been overlapped with the long-dashed line.\n\nreached. The star formation consists of one long episode (8 Gyr)\nwith low efficiency (\u03bd = 0.05 Gyr\u22121 ) and is affected by very intense galactic winds (with a rate 2 times higher than the SFR).\nAs the galactic wind develops, it removes a large gas fraction\nthus decreasing the SFR. This effect, coupled with the low star\nformation rate and the injection of Fe into the ISM by SNe Ia,\ngives rise to the knee observed in [\u03b1/Fe] and [r-process/Fe]. The\nmodels we show now contain non-selective winds. We plotted\nthe [O/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] resulting from the standard model in Fig.\n10 (solid line). We have then run the same model without SNeIa\n(dot-short-dashed line) and without SNeIa and without galactic\nwinds (long-dashed line). We have also considered a model without SNeIa in which the ejection efficiency of \u03b1-elements is enhanced (selective winds) (short-dashed line). Similarly to what\nwe have seen in Fig. 9, if we neglect SNeIa, there is a negligible\nvariation of the [O/Fe] ratio as a function of [Fe/H] (dot-shortdashed and long-dashed lines) and a knee can be attained only\nin the presence of \u03b1-enhanced winds, namely winds in which O\nis ejected out of the galaxy more efficiently than Fe (\u03b1O = 2\u03b1Fe ;\nshort-dashed line). The turnoff point of this curve corresponds to\nthe moment in which the galaxy experiences the galactic wind.\nThis plot shows that only a model which takes properly into account SNe Ia and galactic winds is able to produce the knee in\n[\u03b1/Fe] observed in several dwarf spheroidal galaxies.\n\n\f10\n\nSimone Recchi et al.: Differential winds and chemical evolution of galaxies\n\n5. Discussion and conclusions\nIn this paper we have studied general properties of simple chemical evolution models of galaxies with infall and differential\nwinds, namely with a selective loss of metals from the parent\ngalaxy. We have seen that, assuming gas flows proportional to\nthe SFR, the equations of the evolution of gas mass, total mass\nand metallicity Z of gas can be solved analytically, leading to a\nsimple expression of the variation of Z as a function of the gas\nmass fraction \u03bc and of the ejection efficiency of metals \u03b1 (which\nis defined as the ratio between the metallicity of the galactic\nwind and the metallicity of the ISM). As expected, the resulting metallicity of the galaxy turns out to be systematically lower\nthan the metallicity attained by models with non-differential\nwinds. In particular, the metallicity of models with differential\nwinds tends asymptotically (for low values of \u03bc, namely during the late evolution of the galaxy) to a constant value which\ndecreases almost linearly with \u03b1. We have checked that, for exponential infall laws and star formation rates proportional to the\ngas mass (linear Schmidt law) a constancy between the star formation rate and the infall rate arises quite naturally during the\nlate evolution of the galaxies, provided that the star formation\ntimescale does not differ significantly from the infall timescale.\nIn the first few Gyr the ratio between infall rate and star formation rate can vary quite significantly but, in spite of that, the\nresulting evolution of the metallicity as a function of time does\nnot change appreciably compared to the case with linear flows.\nWe have also analyzed models in which the metallicity of the\ninfalling gas varies with time. A realistic case of infalling gas\nwith increasing metallicity can be envisaged in the interaction\ngalactic winds/ICM. Indeed, this interaction must certainly lead\nto some pollution of the gas external to the galaxy, therefore to\na constant increase of the ICM metallicity, in particular when\ndifferential winds are considered. In order to take it into account,\nwe have made two extreme assumptions:\n\u2013 the metals carried out of the galaxy instantaneously and uniformly mix with the surrounding ICM (instantaneous ICM\nmixing).\n\u2013 The metallicity of the infalling gas is set to be equal to the\nmetallicity of the outflow, representing a physical situation\nin which the very same gas carried out of the galaxy by outflows (or a fraction of it) falls back to the galaxy due to the\npull of its gravitational potential (galactic fountain).\nReal physical situations should lie between these two extreme\nassumptions since the distribution of metals in the ICM is expected to be patchy (Domainko et al. 2006; Sanders & Fabian\n2006; Tornatore et al. 2007). The metallicities predicted by instantaneous ICM mixing models are of course larger than models in which the infalling gas has a pristine chemical composition. The magnitude of this difference depends on the relative\namount of ISM and ICM masses. Under normal circumstances,\nin which the ICM mass is larger than the ISM one, the difference in the final metallicity is only \u223c 0.1 - 0.2 dex. A larger ISM\nmetallicity is obtained by galactic fountains models. This result\ndue to the fact that galactic fountains maximize the chemical enrichment of the infalling gas. This metallicity tends however to\nthe one attained by the model with ZA = 0 if very large metal\nejection efficiencies (\u03b1 \u226b 1) are assumed.\nWe have then studied the metallicity ratios produced by differential wind models. We have seen that the models with variable infall metallicities (both instantaneous ICM mixing and\ngalactic fountain) simply predict that abundance ratios between\n\nchemical elements are given by the ratio of their respective stellar yields (if these do not change with metallicity). Assuming\na fixed infall metallicity ZA , 0 this ratio also depends on the\nvalue of ZA and on the infall parameter \u039b, but nevertheless it\ndoes not change during the evolution of the galaxy. However,\nwe stress here that simple models can be properly applied only\nto SNeII products, whose release is very prompt. Iron is for instance mostly produced by SNeIa, whose explosion timescales\nrange from a few tens of Myr to several Gyr, depending on the\nstar formation history of the considered galaxy (Matteucci &\nRecchi 2001), therefore only the fraction of iron produced by\nSNeII (\u223c 1/3 of the total) can be treated by the simple models. A\nconstant O/Fe ratio, as predicted by simple models is therefore\nexpected because, in this case, both chemical elements are produced by massive stars, on similar timescales and they should\ntherefore have a similar evolution. However, O/Fe ratios are not\nconstant in galaxies and larger ratios are observed in older, more\nmetal-poor stars. The most natural explanation of this trend is\nthat the delayed production of iron by SNeIa reduces the initially\nhigh O/Fe ratio of the oldest stars (time-delay model; Matteucci\n& Greggio 1986).\nSimple models can produce variable abundance ratios either\nif we assume different ejection efficiencies for different chemical species (selective winds) or an IMF variable in time. Both\nassumptions should be quite \"ad hoc\". We have tested the case of\nselective winds for the O/Fe ratio showing that, if the O ejection\nefficiency is significantly larger than the Fe one, O/Fe decreases\nwith time (and with Fe/H). We have confirmed this result also by\nmeans of detailed numerical simulations in which IRA is relaxed\nshowing that, neglecting SNeIa, the only way to get a knee in\nthe [O/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] relation is by assuming \u03b1-enhanced galactic winds. In a model suitable for dwarf spheroidal galaxies, in\nwhich the outflow rate exceeds the infall rate, the O/Fe is almost\nconstant up to [Fe/H] \u223c -1.5, then it bends down. This behavior is consistent with the observation of many dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxies of the Local Group (Venn et al. 2004 and references\ntherein). If instead iron is ejected more efficiently than oxygen,\nthe opposite happens, with O/Fe ratios increasing with time. On\nthe other hand, an iron ejection efficiency larger than the oxygen seems plausible, as it has been shown by chemodynamical\nsimulations of dwarf galaxies experiencing violent bursts of star\nformation (Recchi et al. 2001; 2002). However, also these models predict O/Fe ratios decreasing with time (and with [Fe/H])\nbecause SNeIa were not neglected and their contribution is more\nimportant than selective winds in determining the evolution of\nthe O/Fe ratio. Moreover, Recchi et al.'s model found larger iron\nejection efficiencies precisely because of the delayed explosion\nof SNeIa. These SNe explode in a medium already heated and\ndiluted by the previous activity of SNeII, therefore SNeIa products can be very easily channeled along the galactic funnel. If\nwe neglect SNeIa, O and Fe are produced by the same stars and\nthey should therefore share the same fate.\nOur main conclusions can be summarized as follows:\n\u2013 The differential winds have the effect of reducing the global\nmetallicity of a galaxy. The magnitude of this reduction increases with the ejection efficiency of metals.\n\u2013 This remains true also if we allow a variable metallicity of\nthe infalling gas. Larger galactic metallicities are obtained if\nwe assume that the infall has the metallicity of the outflowing\ngas (galactic fountain model).\n\u2013 Simple models with constant (i.e. non metallicitydependent) yields predict constant abundance ratios,\neven in the presence of differential winds or variable\n\n\fSimone Recchi et al.: Differential winds and chemical evolution of galaxies\n\ninfall metallicities. The same occurs for detailed numerical\nmodels.\n\u2013 One way to get variable abundance ratios in simple models\nis by assuming selective winds, namely differential winds\nwith different ejection efficiencies for each chemical element. However, simple models apply only to chemical elements promptly released on short timescales, therefore large\nelement-to-element variations of the ejection efficiencies are\nnot very likely. Abundance ratios predicted by simple models of chemical evolution are then likely to remain constant\nduring the evolution of the galaxy.\nAcknowledgements.
