We study the Brill-Noether stratification of the coarse moduli space of\nlocally free stable and flat sheaves of a compact K\u00e4hler manifold, proving that these\nstrata have quadratic algebraic singularities.\n\n1. Introduction\nLet X be a compact complex K\u00e4hler manifold of dimension n. Let M be the moduli\nspace of locally free sheaves of OX -modules on X which are stable and flat. It is known\nthat a coarse moduli space of these sheaves can be constructed and that it is a complex\nanalytic space (see [Nor] or [LePoi] for the algebraic case). Moreover the following result,\nproved in [N] and [G-M88], determines the type of singularities of this moduli space:\nTheorem 1.1. The moduli space M has quadratic algebraic singularities.\nIn his article [N], Nadel constructs explicitly the Kuranishi family of deformations of\na stable and flat locally free sheaf of OX -modules E on X and he proves that the base\nspace of this family has quadratic algebraic singularities. Whereas the proof given by\nGoldman and Millson in [G-M88] is based on the study of a germ of analytic space which\nprorepresents the functor of infinitesimal deformations of a sheaf E. They find out this\nanalytic germ and prove that it has quadratic algebraic singularities.\nThis paper is devoted to the local study of the strata of the Brill-Noether stratification\nof the moduli space M and in particular, in the same spirit as Theorem 1.1, to the\ndetermination of their type of singularities.\nIn section 2 we study an equivalence relation between germs of analytic spaces under\nwhich they are said to have the same type of singularities. We prove that this relation is\nformal (Proposition 2.14) and that the set of germs with quadratic algebraic singularities\nis closed under this relation (Theorem 2.16).\nIn section 3 we introduce the Brill-Noether stratification of the moduli space M, we\nare interested in. The subsets of this stratification are defined in the following way. We\nfix integers hi \u2208 N, for all i = 0 . . . n, and we consider the subspace N (h0 . . . hn ) \u2282 M\nof stable and flat locally free sheaves of OX -modules on X, with cohomology spaces\ndimensions fixed: dim H i = hi , for all i = 0 . . . n. Our aim is to study the local structure\nof these strata N (h0 . . . hn ), proving the following\nTheorem 1.2 (Main Theorem). The Brill-Noether strata N (h0 . . . hn ) have quadratic\nalgebraic singularities.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 14H60, 14D20, 13D10, 17B70.\nKey words and phrases.

Then the Main Theorem follows\nfrom the formal property of the relation of have the same type of singularities and from\nthe closure of the set of germs with quadratic algebraic singularities with respect to this\nrelation.\n2. Singularity type\nLet An be the category of analytic algebras and let \u00c2n be the category of complete\nanalytic algebras. We recall that an analytic algebra is a C-algebra which can be written\nin the form C{x1 . . . xn }/I and a morphism of analytic algebras is a local homomorphism\nof C-algebras.\nDefinition 2.1. A homomorphism of rings \u03c8 : R \u2192 S is called formally smooth if, for\nevery exact sequence of local artinian R-algebras: 0 \u2192 I \u2192 B \u2192 A \u2192 0, such that I is\nannihilated by the maximal ideal of B, the induced map HomR (S, B) \u2192 HomR (S, A) is\nsurjective.\nWe recall some facts about formally smooth morphisms of analytic algebras, which we\nuse in this section. We start with the following equivalence of conditions (see [Ser],\nProposition C.50):\nProposition 2.2. Let \u03c8 : R \u2192 S be a local homomorphism of local noetherian Calgebras conteining a field isomorphic to their residue field C. Then the following conditions are equivalent:\n- \u03c8 is formally smooth,\n- \u015c is isomorphic to a formal power series ring over R\u0302,\n- the homomorphism \u03c8\u0302 : R\u0302 \u2192 \u015c induced by \u03c8 is formally smooth.\nFurthermore, we recall two Artin's important results (see [A], Theorem 1.5a and Corollary 1.6):\nTheorem 2.3. Let R and S be analytic algebras and let R\u0302 and \u015c be their completions. Let \u03c8\u0304 : R \u2192 \u015c be a morphism of analytic algebras, then, for all n \u2208 N, there\nexists a morphism of analytic algebras \u03c8n : R \u2192 S, such that the following diagram is\ncommutative:\nR\n\n\u03c8n\n\n/S\n\n\u03c0n\n\nId\n\nR\n\n/ S/mn\nS\nId\n\n\u03c8\u0304\n\n/\n\n\u015c\n\n\u03c0n\n\n/ S/mn .\nS\n\nCorollary 2.4. With the notation of Theorem 2.3, if in addition \u03c8\u0304 induces an isomorphims \u03c8\u0304\u02c6 : R\u0302 \u2192 \u015c, then \u03c8n is an isomorphism, provided n \u2265 2.\nUsing these results, we can prove the following\nProposition 2.5. Let R and S be analytic algebras and let R\u0302 and \u015c be their completions.\nLet \u03c8\u0302 : R\u0302 \u2192 \u015c be a smooth morphism, then there exists a smooth morphism R \u2192 S.\n\n\fLOCAL STRUCTURE OF BRILL-NOETHER STRATAIN THE MODULI SPACE OF FLAT STABLE BUNDLES\n3\n\nProof. By Thereom 2.2, there exists an isomorphism \u03c6\u0302 : R\u0302[[x]] \u2192 \u015c, Corollary 2.4\nimplies that there exists an isomorphism \u03c6 : R{x} \u2192 S, which is obviously smooth by\nTheorem 2.2. Thus the morphism \u03c6 \u25e6 i : R \u0592\u2192 R{x} \u2192 S is smooth.\n\u0003\nTo complete our study of analytic algebras, we prove the following\nProposition 2.6. Let R and S be analytic algebras, such that\n- dimC mR /m2R = dimC mS /m2S and\n- R{z1 , . . . , zN } \u223c\n= S{z1 , . . . , zM }, for some N and M ,\nthen R and S are isomorphic.\nProof. The first hypothesis implies that, in the isomorphism R{z1 , . . . , zN } \u223c\n= S{z1 , . . . , zM },\nN = M . Moreover, proving the proposition by induction on N , the first hypothesis makes\nthe inductive step trivial. Thus it is sufficient to prove the proposition for N = 1.\nLet R = C{x1 , . . . , xn }/I and S = C{y1 , . . . , ym }/J be analytic algebras, with I \u2282\n(x1 , . . . , xn )2 and J \u2282 (y1 , . . . , ym )2 . Let \u03c6 : C{x}{z}/I \u2192 C{y}{z}/J be an isomorphism and let \u03c8 its inverse. Let \u03c6(z) = \u03b1z + \u03b2(y) + \u03b3(y, z) and let \u03c8(z) = az + b(x) +\nc(x, z), where \u03b1, a \u2208 C are costants, \u03b2, \u03b3, b and c are polynomial, \u03b3 and c do not contain\ndegree one terms and, with a linear change of variables, we can suppose that \u03c6 and \u03c8\ndo not contain constant term.\nIf at least one between \u03b1 and a is different from zero, then the thesis follows easly. For\nexample, if \u03b1 6= 0, the image \u03c6(z) satisfies the hypothesis of Weierstrass Preparation\nTheorem and so it can be written as \u03c6(z) = (z + h(y)) * u(y, z), where u is a unit and\nh(y) is a polynomial. Then \u03c6 is well defined and induces an isomorphism on quotients:\n\u03c6 : C{x}/I \u2192 C{y}{z}/J * (z + h(y)) \u223c\n= C{y}/J.\nLet's now analyse the case \u03b1 = a = 0. Let \u03bd : C{x}{z}/I \u2192 C{x}{z}/I be a homomorphism defined by \u03bd(xi ) = xi , for all i, and \u03bd(z) = z +b(x). It is obviously an isomorphims\nand the composition \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03bd is an isomorphims from C{x}{z}/I to C{y}{z}/J, such that\n\u03c6 \u25e6 \u03bd(z) contains a linear term in z, thus, passing to the quotient, it induces an isomorphism C{x}/I \u223c\n\u0003\n= C{y}/J.\nNow we consider the following relation between analytic algebras:\nR\u221dS\n\niff\n\n\u2203 R \u2212\u2192 S\n\nformally smooth morphism,\n\nlet \u223c be the equivalence relation between analytic algebras generated by \u221d. We define\nan other equivalence relation:\nR \u2248 S iff R{x1 . . . xn } \u223c\n= S{y1 . . . ym } are isomorphic, for some n and m.\nThe relation \u2248 is the same as the relation \u223c. Infact, if R \u223c S, there exists a chain of\nformally smooth morphisms R \u2192 T1 \u2190 T2 \u2192 . . . \u2192 Tn \u2190 S, that, by Theorem 2.2 and\nCorollary 2.4, gives an isomorphism R{x} \u223c\n= S{y}, then R \u2248 S. Viceversa, if R \u2248 S,\nthere exists an isomorphism R{x} \u223c\n= S{y} which is formally smooth, thus we have the\nchain of formally smooth morphisms R \u2192 R{x} \u2192 S{x} \u2190 S and R \u223c S.\nWe consider the following relation between complete analytic algebras:\nR\u0302 \u221d \u015c\n\niff\n\n\u2203 R\u0302 \u2192 \u015c\n\nformally smooth morphism,\n\nlet \u223c be the equivalence relation between analytic algebras generated by \u221d. We define\nan other equivalence relation:\nR\u0302 \u2261 \u015c iff R\u0302[[x1 . . . xn ]] \u223c\n= \u015c[[x1 . . . xm ]] are isomorphic, for some n and m.\nAs before, the relation \u2261 is the same as the relation \u223c. Furthermore, the equivalence\nrelation \u223c on completions of analytic algebras coincides with the relation \u223c between\n\n\f4\n\nELENA MARTINENGO\n\nthe analytic algebras themselves, because obviously the two relations \u2261 and \u2248 are the\nsame.\nThe opposite category of the category of analytic algebras Ano is called the category\nof germs of analytic spaces. The geometrical meaning of this definition is that a germ\nAo can be represented by (X, x, \u03b1), where X is a complex space with a distinguished\npoint x and \u03b1 is a fixed isomorphism of C-algebras OX,x \u223c\n= A. Two triples, (X, x, \u03b1)\nand (Y, y, \u03b2), are equivalent if there exists an isomorphism from a neighborhood of x in\nX to a neighborhood of y in Y which sends x in y and which induces an isomorphism\nOX,x \u223c\n= OY,y .\nLet (X, x) and (Y, y) be germs of analytic spaces, given by the analytic algebras S\nand R respectively, let \u03a8 : (X, x) \u2192 (Y, y) be a morphism of germs of analytic spaces\nand let \u03c8 : R \u2192 S be the corresponding morphism of analytic algebras.\nDefinition 2.7. The morphism \u03a8 : (X, x) \u2192 (Y, y) is called smooth if the morphism\n\u03c8 : R \u2192 S is formally smooth.\nWe consider the following relation between germs of analytic spaces:\n(X, x) \u221d (Y, y) iff \u2203 (X, x) \u2212\u2192 (Y, y) smooth morphism\nand we define \u223c to be the equivalence relation between germs of analytic spaces generated by the relation \u221d. It is obvious that the relation \u223c defined between germs of\nanalytic spaces is the same as the relation \u223c defined between their corresponding analytic algebras. As in [V], we give the following\nDefinition 2.8. The analytic spaces (X, x) and (Y, y) are said to have the same type\nof singularities if they are equivalent under the relation \u223c.\nOur aim is to prove that the property that two germs of analytic spaces have the same\ntype of singularities is formal, that is that it can be controlled at the level of functors.\nIn all this paper we consider covariant functors F : ArtC \u2192 Set from the category of\nlocal artinian C-algebras with residue field C to the category of sets, such that F(C) =\none point set. The functors of this type are called functors of Artin rings. In the following\nwe recall some basic notions about these functors.\nLet F be a functor of Artin rings. The tangent space to F is the set F(C[\u01eb]), where\nC[\u01eb] is the local artinian C-algebra of dual numbers, i.e. C[\u01eb] = C[x]/(x2 ) . It can be\nproved that F(C[\u01eb]) has a structure of C-vector space (see [S], Lemma 2.10).\nAn ostruction theory (V, ve ) for F is the data of a C-vector space V , called obstruction\nspace, and, for every exact sequence in the category ArtC :\ne : 0 \u2212\u2192 I \u2212\u2192 B \u2212\u2192 A \u2212\u2192 0,\nsuch that I is annihilated by the maximal ideal of B, a map ve : F(A) \u2192 V \u2297C I called\nobstruction map.

Moreover a functor which satisfies the two of the Schlessinger's\nconditions (H1) and (H2) is said to have a good deformation theory. We do not precise\nthis concept, because all functors that apper in the following are functors with a good\ndeformation theory and all the ones involved in the proof of the Main Theorem have\nhull.\nWith above notions, we can state the following Standard Smoothness Criterion (see\n[Man99], Proposition 2.17):\nTheorem 2.11.

The functors F and G are said to have the same type of singularity\nif they are equivalent under the relation \u223c.\nNow we want to link Definitions 2.8 and 2.13 in the case the functors considered have\nhulls. Let F and G be two functors with hulls, given by the germs of analytic spaces (X, x)\nand (Y, y), defined by the analytic algebras S and R respectively.

Let F and G be two functors with hulls given by the germs of analytic\nspaces (X, x) and (Y, y) respectively and let \u03c6 : F \u2192 G be a smooth morphism. Then\nthere exists a smooth morphism between the two germs (X, x) and (Y, y).\nProof. Let S and R be the analytic algebras that define the germ (X, x = 0) and\n(Y, y = 0) respectively. By hypothesis, we have the following diagram:\nFO\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u03b1\n\n/G\nO\n\u03b2\n\n\u03c6\u0302\n\nHom(\u015c, \u2212) _ _ _/ Hom(R\u0302, \u2212)\nwhere, by definition of hull, \u03b1 and \u03b2 are smooth morphism and they are bijective on tangent spaces. Then, by smoothness, there exists a morphism \u03c6\u0302 : Hom(\u015c, \u2212) \u2192 Hom(R\u0302, \u2212)\nthat makes the diagram commutative. By hypothesis on \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03c6, it is surjective on\ntangent spaces and it is injective on obstruction spaces. Thus \u03c6\u0302 is a smooth morphism,\nby the Standard Smoothness Criterion (Theorem 2.11).\nThe morphism \u03c6\u0302 determines uniquely an homomorphism \u03c8\u0302 : R\u0302 \u2192 \u015c, which is formally\nsmooth, by Propositions 2.2 and 2.12. Now, by Proposition 2.5, there exists a formally\nsmooth morphism \u03c8 : R \u2192 S and so a smooth morphism between the germs (X, x) and\n(Y, y).\n\u0003\nNow, if F \u223c G, there exists a chain of smooth morphisms of functors F \u2190 H1 \u2192 H2 \u2190\n. . . \u2192 G. Then Hi necessary have hulls, we indicate with Ti the complete analytic algebra\nthat is an hull for Hi .

Let X be a complex affine scheme, it is said to have quadratic algebraic singularities if it is defined by finitely many quadratic homogeneous polynomials.\nLet X be an analytic space, it is said to have quadratic algebraic singularities if it is\nlocally isomorphic to complex affine schemes with quadratic algebraic singularities.\nFor germs of analytic spaces we want to prove the following\nTheorem 2.16. Let (X, 0) and (Y, 0) be two germs of analytic spaces and let \u03c6 :\n(X, 0) \u2212\u2192 (Y, 0) be a smooth morphism. Then (X, 0) has quadratic algebraic singularities if and only if (Y, 0) has quadratic algebraic singularities.\n\n\fLOCAL STRUCTURE OF BRILL-NOETHER STRATAIN THE MODULI SPACE OF FLAT STABLE BUNDLES\n7\n\nWe need the following\nLemma 2.17. Let (X, 0) and (Y, 0) be two germs of analytic spaces and let \u03c6 : (X, 0) \u2212\u2192\n(Y, 0) be a smooth morphism. Let X \u2282 CN and let H = {x \u2208 CN | h(x) = 0} be an\nhypersurface of CN , such that:\n- dh(0) 6= 0\n- T H 6\u2283 T \u03c6\u22121 (0),\nthen: \u03c6|X\u2229H : (X \u2229 H, 0) \u2212\u2192 (Y, 0) is a smooth morphism.\nProof. Let (X, 0) and (Y, 0) be defined by C{x1 , . . . , xn }/I and C{y1 , . . . , ym }/J respectively. Since \u03c6 is smooth, OX,0 is a power series ring over OY,0 , i.e. OX,0 \u223c\n= OY,0 {t1 , . . . , ts },\nfor some s.\nLet X \u2032 = X \u2229 H be the intersection, then OX \u2032 ,0 \u223c\n= OX,0 /(h). If g corresponds to h by\n\u223c\nthe isomorphism OX,0 \u223c\nO\n{t\n,\n.\n.\n.\n,\nt\n},\nthen\nO\n= Y,0 1\ns\nX \u2032 ,0 = OY,0 {t1 , . . . , ts }/(g).\nThe hypothesis dh(0) 6= 0 becomes dg(0) 6= 0, that implies that there exists an indeterminate between yi and ti , such that the partial derivative of g with respect to this\nindeterminate calculated in zero is not zero. Moreover, the hypothesis T H 6\u2283 T \u03c6\u22121 (0)\nimplies that this indeterminate must be one of the ti , for example ti .\nThus, using the Implicit Function Theorem, we obtain OX \u2032 ,0 \u223c\n= OY,0 {t1 , . . . , ts }/(g) \u223c\n=\n\u0003\nOY,0 {t1 , . . . , tbi , . . . , ts } and \u03c6|X \u2032 is a smooth morphism.\nNow we can prove Theorem 2.16:\n\nProof. We start by assuming that (Y, 0) has quadratic algebraic singularities, so (Y, 0)\nis defined by the analytic algebra C{y1 , . . . , ym }/J, where J is an ideal generated by quadratic polynomials. Since \u03c6 is smooth, we have OX,0 \u223c\n= OY,0 {t1 , . . . , ts } \u223c\n= C{y1 , . . . , ym }{t1 , . . . , ts }/J,\nfor some s, and X has quadratic algebraic singularities.\nNow we prove the other implication. Let C{x1 , . . . , xn }/I and C{y1 , . . . , ym }/J be\nthe analytic algebras, that define the germs (X, 0) and (Y, 0) respectively, where I is an\nideal generated by quadratic polynomials. We can assume that \u03c6 is not an isomorphism,\notherwise the theorem is trivial. Since \u03c6 is smooth, OX,0 \u223c\n= OY,0 {t1 , . . . , ts }, for some\ns > 0.\nN\nNow we can intersect X \u2282 CN\nx with hyperplanes h1 , . . . , hs of Cx , which correspond,\n\u223c\nby the isomorphism OX,0 = OY,0 {t1 , . . . , ts }, to the hyperplanes of equations t1 =\nand we call the intersection X \u2032 . Then (X \u2032 , 0) has quadratic\n0, . . . , ts = 0 of Cm+s\ny,t\nalgebraic singularities. Moreover, by lemma 2.17, \u03c6 restricted to (X \u2032 , 0) is a smooth morphism and it is bijective because OX \u2032 ,0 \u223c\n= OX,0 /(h1 , . . . , hs ) \u223c\n= OY,0 {t1 , . . . , ts }/(t1 , . . . , ts ) \u223c\n=\nOY,0 . Thus (Y, 0) has quadratic algebraic singularities.\n\u0003\nThis theorem assures that the set of germs of analytic spaces with quadratic algebraic\nsingularities is closed under the relation \u223c and so it is a union of equivalent classes under\nthis relation. Moreover we know that the relation \u223c defined between functors with hulls\nis the same as the relation \u223c defined between their germs. Thus is natural to introduce\nthe following definition for functors:\nDefinition 2.18. Let F be a functor with hull the germ of analytic space (X, x). It is said\nto have quadratic algebraic singularities if (X, x) has quadratic algebraic singularities.\nThis definition is indipendent by the choice of the germ of analytic space which is a hull\nof F, because the isomorphisms class of a hull is uniquely determined.\n\n\f8\n\nELENA MARTINENGO\n\n3.

In\nthe first part of this section we concentrate our interests to the study of subspaces of\nthe moduli space M, defined globally as sets in the following way:\nDefinition 3.1. Let hi \u2208 N be fixed integers, for all i = 0 . . . n, we define:\nN (h0 . . . hn ) = {E \u2032 \u2208 M | dim H i (X, E \u2032 ) = hi }.\nIt is obvious that, for a generic choice of the integers hi \u2208 N, the subspace N (h0 . . . hn )\nis empty, from now on we fix our attention on non empty ones.\nLet E \u2208 M be one fixed stable and flat locally free sheaf of OX -modules on X\nand let hi = dim H i (X, E). Let U \u2192 M \u00d7 X be the universal Kuranishi family of\ndeformations of E, parametrized by the germ of analytic space M , which is isomorphic\nto a neighbourhood of E in M (see [N] for the construction). Let \u03bd : M \u00d7 X \u2192 M be\nprojection, thus, for all E \u2032 \u2208 M , we have \u03bd \u22121 (E \u2032 ) \u223c\n= X and U |\u03bd \u22121 (E \u2032 ) = U |E \u2032 \u223c\n= E \u2032.\nNow let's define the germ of the strata N (h0 . . . hn ) at its point E. Since, for all\ni = 0 . . . n, the function E \u2032 \u2208 M \u2192 dim H i (X, E \u2032 ) \u2208 N is upper semicontinuos, for\nSemicontinuity Theorem (see [Hart], TheoremT12.8, ch.III), the set Ui = {E \u2032 \u2208 M |\ndim H i (X, E \u2032 ) \u2264 hi } and the intersection U = i=0...n Ui = {E \u2032 \u2208 M | dim H i (X, E \u2032 ) \u2264\nhi , for i = 0 . . . n} are open subsets of M.\nFor all i = 0 . . . n, let Ni (E) = V (Fhi \u22121 (Ri \u03bd\u2217 U )) = {E \u2032 \u2208 M | dim Ri \u03bd\u2217 U \u2297OM k(E \u2032 ) >\nhi \u2212 1} be the closed subschemes of M defined by the sheaf of ideals Fhi \u22121 (Ri \u03bd\u2217 U ),\nwhich is T\nthe sheaf of (hi \u2212 1)-th Fitting ideals of the sheaf of OM -modules Ri \u03bd\u2217 U .

We observe that the support of the germ of the strata N (h0 . . . hn ) at\nE, defined in 3.2, coincide with a neighbourhood of E in set given in definition 3.1.\nInfact, for the Theorem of Cohomology and Base Change (see [Hart], Theorem 12.11,\nch.III), we have Rn \u03bd\u2217 U \u2297OM k(E \u2032 ) \u223c\n= H n (X, E \u2032 ), then the condition which defines Nn (E)\nbecomes dim H n (X, E \u2032 ) \u2265 hn and the ones which define the intersection U \u2229 Nn (E)\nbecome dim H n (X, E \u2032 ) = hn and dim H i (X, E \u2032 ) \u2264 hi , for all i = 0 . . . n \u2212 1.

Definition of Def 0E using DGLAs\nWe are interested in the study of the functor Def 0E and in this section we link it with\nthe theory of deformations via DGLAs.\nWe start with some reminds about this theory.

Let (x, ea ) \u2208 MC\u03c7 (A), for A \u2208\n(0,1)\nArtC . Since x \u2208 AX (End E) \u2297 mA satisfies the Maurer-Cartan equation, it gives a de(0,\u2217)\n(0,\u2217)\nformation EA = ker(\u2202 \u0304 + x) of E over A.

Thus we have the following characterization of Def 0E using\nX\n\nDGLAs point of view (see [Man07], Lemma 4.1).\nProposition 4.6. The subfunctor Def 0E is isomorphic to the image of the morphism\n\u03a6 : Def \u03c7 \u2192 Def A(0,\u2217) (End E) .\nX\n\n5. Proof of the Main Theorem\nThis section is devoted to the proof of the Main Theorem. With the above notations\n\n\fLOCAL STRUCTURE OF BRILL-NOETHER STRATAIN THE MODULI SPACE OF FLAT STABLE BUNDLES\n13\n\nTheorem 5.1 (Main Theorem). The Brill-Noether strata N (h0 . . . hn ) have quadratic\nalgebraic singularities.\nProof. The local study of the strata N (h0 . . . hn ) at one of its point E, corresponds to\nthe study of a germ of analytic space which prorepresents the functor Def 0E . Our proof\nis divided into four steps in which we find out a chain of functors, linked each other\nby smooth morphisms, from the functor Def 0E to a deformation functor for which it is\nknown that the germ of analytic space that prorepresents it has quadratic algebraic\nsingularities. Then, we conclude, using properties proved in section 2.\nFirst Step. We prove that the morphism \u03a6 : Def \u03c7 \u2192 Def 0E is smooth. Then, given a\n\u03b1\nprincipal extension in ArtC , 0 \u2192 J \u2192 B \u2192 A \u2192 0, and an element (EA , fAi ) \u2208 Def \u03c7 (A),\nwe have to prove that, if its image EA \u2208 Def 0E (A) has a lifting EB \u2208 Def 0E (B), it has a\nlifting in Def \u03c7 (B).\nSince EA \u2208 Def 0E (A) and EB \u2208 Def 0E (B), their cohomology spaces are deformations of\ni\nH (E) over A and B respectively and so H i (EA ) \u223c\n= H i (E) \u2297 A and H i (EB ) \u223c\n= H i (E) \u2297 B.\nThus H i (EB ) is a lifting of H i (EA ) and it is a polynomial algebra over B. It follows that\nin the diagram\nH i (EB ) U\nO\n\nB\n\nfi\n\n/ H i (EA ) A / H i (E) \u2297 A\nU U\nOO\nU U fBi\nU U\n\u03b2=Id \u2297\u03b1\nU U\nU*\n/ H i (E) \u2297 B\n\nthere exists a homomorphism fBi : H i (EB ) \u2192 H i (E) \u2297 B, which lifts fAi . Then also the\nfollowing diagram commutes:\nH i (E)\n\n\u007f?\n\u007f\u007f\n\u007f\n\u007f fi\n\nH i (EB )\n\nB\n\n_??\n??\n??\n\nB\n\n_??\n??\n?\n\n/ H i (E) \u2297 B\n\u007f?\n\u007f\u007f\n\u007f\n\u007f\u007f\n\nand so fBi is an isomorphism, for all i \u2208 N.\nSecond Step. Since X is a K\u00e4hler manifold and E is a hermitian sheaf, the operators \u2202 \u0304E\u2217 ,\nadjoint of \u2202 \u0304E , and the Laplacian \u0003E = \u2202 \u0304E \u2202 \u0304E\u2217 + \u2202 \u0304E\u2217 \u2202 \u0304E can be defined between forms on\n(0,\u2217)\nX with values in the sheaf E. Let HX (E) = ker \u0003E be the complex of (0, \u2217)-harmonic\n(0,\u2217)\n(0,\u2217)\nforms on X with values in E and let Hom\u2217 (HX (E), HX (E)) be the formal DGLA of\nthe homomorphisms of this complex.\n\u2217\n \u0304\nAlso for the sheaf End E the operator \u2202 \u0304End\nE , adjoint of \u2202End E , and the Laplacian\n0,\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u0003End E = \u2202 \u0304End E \u2202 \u0304End E + \u2202 \u0304End E \u2202 \u0304End E can be defined. Let HX (End E) = ker \u0003End E be\nthe complex of the (0, \u2217)-harmonic forms on X with values in End E.\nSiu proved (see [Siu]) that, for a flat holomorphic vector bundle L on a K\u00e4hler manifold\nX, the two Laplacian operators \u0003L and \u0003L coincide. Then a (0, \u2217)-form on X with values\nin L is harmonic if and only if it anhilates \u2202, which is well defined because L is flat.\n0,\u2217\n(End E) is a DGLA with\nSince End E is flat, these facts imply that the complex HX\nbracket given by the wedge product on forms and the composition of endomorphisms.\n\n\f14\n\nELENA MARTINENGO\n(0,\u2217)\n\n(0,\u2217)\n\n(0,\u2217)\n\nMoreover, we can define a morphism \u03a9 : HX (End E) \u2192 Hom\u2217 (HX (E), HX (E)).\n(0,\u2217)\n(0,\u2217)\nEvery element x \u2208 AX (End E) gives naturally an homomorphism \u03a9(x) from AX (E)\nin itself, defined locally to be the wedge product between forms and the action of the\nendomorphism on the elements of E. If we defined it on an open cover of X on which\n(0,\u2217)\nboth the sheaves E and End E have costant transition functions, when x \u2208 HX (End E)\n(0,\u2217)\nand \u03a9(x) is restricted to the harmonic forms HX (E), it gives as a result an harmonic\n(0,\u2217)\n(0,\u2217)\n(0,\u2217)\nform.

Thus, using the Standard Smootheness Criterion (Theorem 2.11), we conclude\nthat \u03a8 is smooth.\nFourth Step. Let's write explicitly Def \u03a9\u0303 .

Since the differential\n(0,\u2217)\nin the DGLA H\u0303X (End E) is zero and since the equation ea \u2217 \u03a9\u0303(x) = 0 can be written\nas \u03a9\u0303(x) = e\u2212a \u2217 0 = 0, we obtain, for all A \u2208 ArtC :\nn\no\n(0,\u2217)\n(0,\u2217)\nMC\u03a9\u0303 (A) = x \u2208 ker \u03a9\u0303 \u2297 mA | [x, x] = 0 \u00d7 exp(Hom0 (HX (E), HX (E)) \u2297 mA ).\n(0,\u2217)\n\n(0,\u2217)\n\n(0,0)\n\nMoreover exp(H\u0303X (End E) \u2297 mA ) \u00d7 exp(d Hom\u22121 (HX (E), HX (E)) \u2297 mA ) is equal\nto zero, thus there isn't gauge action.
