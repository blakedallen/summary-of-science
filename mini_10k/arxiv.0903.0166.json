The main construction lemma in\nCalegari and Gabai's proof of Marden's Tameness Conjecture can be replaced by\nan applicable version of our theorem. Finally, we will give a short proof of the\nconjecture along their ideas.\n57M50; 30F40\n\nAgol [1] and Calegari and Gabai [5] proved independently that any hyperbolic 3\u2013\nmanifold M with finitely generated fundamental group is homeomorphic to the interior\nof a compact 3\u2013manifold. This is the affirmative answer to Marden's Tameness\nConjecture in [8]. Subsequently, Choi [7] gave another proof of the conjecture, similar\nto Agol's, in the case when M has no parabolic cusps.\nWe are here interested in arguments in [5], where the notion of \"shrinkwrapping\" was\nintroduced. Shrinkwrappings play an important role in their proof. For the proof of the\nexistence of shrinkwrappings and that of their CAT(\u22121)\u2013property, Calegari and Gabai\nused very deep and rarefied arguments, which some readers, including the author, may\nfind difficult to approach. This paper is intended to give an elementary proof of part of\ntheir proof by using ruled wrappings instead of shrinkwrappings.\nFor simplicity, we only consider the case when a hyperbolic 3\u2013manifold has no parabolic\ncusps and will prove the following theorem.\nTheorem 0.1 Let N be an orientable hyperbolic 3\u2013manifold without parabolic cusps,\n\u2206 a disjoint union of finitely many simple closed geodesics in N , and f : \u03a3 \u2212\u2192 N\na 2\u2013incompressible map rel. \u2206 from a closed orientable surface \u03a3 of genus greater\nthan 1 to N \\ \u2206. Then there exists a homotopy F : \u03a3 \u00d7 [0, 1] \u2212\u2192 N satisfying the\nfollowing conditions.\n(i) F(x, 0) = f (x) for any x \u2208 \u03a3.\n(ii) F(\u03a3 \u00d7 [0, 1)) \u2229 \u2206 = \u2205.\n(iii) The map g : \u03a3 \u2212\u2192 N defined by g(x) = F(x, 1) is a CAT(\u22121)\u2013piecewise ruled\nmap.\n\nPublished: 12 September 2006\n\nDOI: 10.2140/gt.2006.10.1173\n\n\f1174\n\nTeruhiko Soma\n\nHere, a continuous map f : \u03a3 \u2212\u2192 N is said to be 2\u2013incompressible in N rel. \u2206 if\nf (\u03a3) \u2229 \u2206 = \u2205, f\u2217 : \u03c01 (\u03a3) \u2212\u2192 \u03c01 (N \\ \u2206) is injective, and for any simple noncontractible\nloop l in \u03a3 the restriction f |l is not freely homotopic in N \\ \u2206 to a (multiplied) meridian\nof any component of \u2206. See Definition 1.4 for the definition of piecewise ruled maps.\nWe say that a map g satisfying properties (i)\u2013(iii) as above or its image g(\u03a3) is a\nCAT(\u22121)\u2013ruled wrapping of \u2206 in N homotopic to f . In fact, Theorem 0.1 is a special\ncase of Proposition 2.1, which corresponds to the main construction lemma in [5].\nIn Section 4, we will give a short proof of Marden's Conjecture along ideas in [5]. Our\nproof is self-contained in the sense that it does not rely on published partial solutions to\nthe conjecture. It is not hard to see that all arguments and proofs in this paper work also\nin the case when the ambient manifold N has pinched negative curvature and hyperbolic\ncusps by invoking results in Canary [6, Section 4].\nAcknowledgments The author would like to thank Brian Bowditch and the referee\nfor helpful comments and suggestions.\n\n1\n\nCompletion of certain hyperbolic metrics\n\nFor a closed subset A in a metric space (X, d), the r\u2013neighborhood of A in X ,\n{y \u2208 X; d(y, A) \u2264 r}, is denoted by Nr (A) (or more strictly by Nr (A, X)). In the case\nwhen A is a single point set {x}, we also set Nr ({x}) = Br (x). The link of x in X with\nradius r, {y \u2208 X; d(y, x) = r}, is denoted by Sr (x).\nLet U be a simply connected incomplete hyperbolic 3\u2013manifold with metric completion\nU such that each component l of L = U \\ U is a geodesic line, and there exists a\nconstant c > 0 with dist(x, y) \u2265 3c for any points x, y contained in distinct components\nof L. Moreover, we suppose that for any component l of L there exists an infinite cyclic\nbranched covering pl : Nc (l, U) \u2212\u2192 Nc (j, H3 ) branched over a geodesic line j of H3 ,\nsuch that the restriction pl |Nc (l,U)\\l is a locally isometric covering.

Let xi (i = 1, 2) be\nthe point in \u03c3i with dist(x1 , l) = dist(x2 , l) = s > 0, where l is the component of L\ncontaining x; see Figure 1 (a).

Since the subsegment \u03c4 of \u03c3 with \u2202\u03c4 = {x1 , x2 } is the shortest\narc in U connecting x1 with x2 , we have\n(1\u20131)\n\n\u03b81 + \u03b82 = \u03c0,\n\nwhere \u03b8i is the angle made by \u03c3i and a fixed ray in l emanating from x. This fact is\neasily seen by considering the developing of P1 \u222a P2 on H2 ; see Figure 1 (b).\nFor any d with 0 < d \u2264 c, the set Bd (x, U) is homeomorphic to the subset of R3\n{(u, v, w) \u2208 R3 ; u2 + v2 + w2 \u2264 1, w > 0} \u222a {(u, 0, 0) \u2208 R3 ; \u22121 \u2264 u \u2264 1}.\nIn particular, Bd (x, U) is simply connected. The image pl (Bd (x, U)) coincides with\nthe hyperbolic ball Bd (b\nx, H3 ), where b\nx = pl (x). Rescaling the metric on the boundary\n3\nx, H ) of the ball, we have the spherical metric \u03bd on S isometric to the unit sphere\nS = Sd (b\nin the Euclidean 3\u2013space. Consider the metric on e\nS = Sd (x, U), still denoted by \u03bd , so\ne\ne\nthat the infinite cyclic branched covering pl |S : S \u2212\u2192 S is locally pathwise isometric.\nHere, pl |e\nS being locally pathwise isometric means that length\u03bd (\u03b1) = length\u03bd (pl (\u03b1))\nfor any rectifiable arc \u03b1 in e\nS. One can take d > 0 so that \u03c3 0 = \u03c3 \u2229 Bd (x) is a geodesic\nsegment in Bd (x) with \u2202\u03c3 0 \u2282 e\nS. Let \u03b3 be any rectifiable arc in e\nS with \u2202\u03b3 = \u2202\u03c3 0 .\n0\nSince Bd (x) is simply connected, \u03b3 is homotopic rel. \u2202\u03b3 to \u03c3 in Bd (x). Then the\nfollowing lemma is proved immediately from the equality (1\u20131) and by checking the\nsituation of \u03b3\nb = pl (\u03b3) in S; see Figure 2.\nLemma 1.1 length\u03bd (\u03b3) \u2265 \u03c0 .\nFor any k \u2264 0, let F(k) be a complete Riemannian plane of constant curvature k.

If x \u2208 U then Br (x) is obviously a CAT(\u22121)\u2013space if we\ntake r so that Br (x) \u2229 L = \u2205. So suppose that x \u2208 L. Let \u2206 be any triangle in Bc (x)\nwith geodesic edges \u03b31 , \u03b32 , \u03b33 . Each Int \u03b3i either meets L at most one point pi or is\ncontained in L. From this, we know that the union \u03b31 \u222a \u03b32 \u222a \u03b32 bounds a triangle \u22060 in\nBc (x) consisting of at most three totally geodesic hyperbolic subtriangles. In fact, when\np1 , p2 , p3 exist, the totally geodesic triangle with vertices p1 , p2 , p3 is degenerated to a\ngeodesic segment in L. By Lemma 1.1, the internal angle of \u22060 at any pi is at least\n\u03c0 . This shows that \u22060 is not thicker than a comparison triangle in H2 . It follows that\nBc (x) is a CAT(\u22121)\u2013space.\nIt is not hard to see that any geodesic segment in U is a broken line consisting of finitely\nmany hyperbolic segments, and any vertex of the broken line other than its end points\nlies in L. By Lemma 1.2, a geodesic segment \u03c3 in U connecting two given points is\nuniquely determined. Moreover, \u03c3 varies continuously with its end points.\nLet Z be an incomplete hyperbolic 3\u2013manifold such that the total space of the universal\ncovering q : U \u2212\u2192 Z has the induced metric as above. We suppose moreover that\nfor the metric completion Z each component l of Z \\ Z is either a geodesic line or a\ngeodesic loop. That is, no component of Z \\ Z is a one point set. Then q : U \u2212\u2192 Z\nis extended to a locally pathwise isometric map q\u0304 : U \u2212\u2192 Z . Note that the frontier\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\fExistence of ruled wrappings in hyperbolic 3\u2013manifolds\n\n1177\n\n{x \u2208 Z; dist(x, l) = c} of Nc (l, Z) in Z is homeomorphic to either R2 or an open\nannulus or a torus.\nRemark 1.3 Even in the case when Nc (l, Z) is homeomorphic to a solid torus, we\nalways suppose that homotopies in Z starting from a continuous map f : A \u2212\u2192 Z never\ncross l (possibly they touch l), where A is a manifold of dimension less than three. In\nother words, we only consider homotopies F : A \u00d7 [0, 1] \u2212\u2192 Z which can be covered\ne: A\ne \u00d7 [0, 1] \u2212\u2192 U , where A\ne is the universal covering space of A.\nby a map F\nDefinition 1.4 Let f : \u03a3 \u2212\u2192 Z be a continuous map from a closed orientable surface\n\u03a3. Suppose that \u03a3 admits a cell decomposition K consisting of finitely many triangular\n2\u2013cells. We say that f is a piecewise ruled map with respect to K if (i) for each edge of\ne of K , f (e) is a broken line consisting of finitely many hyperbolic segments, and (ii) for\neach 2\u2013cell F of K , f (F) is a ruled triangle based on a single vertex. Since the Gaussian\ncurvature at any smooth point of a ruled surface is nonpositive, the (intrinsic) curvature\nof \u03a3 at any smooth point is at most \u22121. This map f is called a CAT(\u22121)\u2013piecewise\nruled map if the cone-angle of \u03a3 at any singular point is at least 2\u03c0 .\n\n2\n\nApplicable version of Theorem 0.1\n\nThroughout this section, we assume that all hyperbolic 3\u2013manifolds and surfaces are\norientable.\nLet N be a complete hyperbolic 3\u2013manifold N without parabolic cusps, and W a\n3\u2013dimensional compact connected submanifold of N .

Consider a cell decomposition K of \u03a3 consisting of triangular\n2\u2013cells and such that each vertex of K is contained in c1 \u222a * * * \u222a c3m\u22123 . If necessary\nby deforming f by a homotopy in the sense of Remark 1.3 we may assume that each\nf (ci ) is a closed geodesic in Z , and f (e) is a geodesic segment in Z for any edge e of K\nnot contained in c1 \u222a * * * \u222a c3m\u22123 . In fact, f (ci ) is the image of an axis of a hyperbolic\ntransformation on the metric completion U of the universal covering space of Z . See\nfor example [3, Theorem 6.8 (1)]. For any 2\u2013cell F of K , take a vertex v0 and the\nopposite edge e0 . Then, f |F can be homotoped rel. \u2202F to a map g|F such that g(F)\nis a ruled triangle consisting of all geodesic segments connecting f (v0 ) with points of\nf (e0 ). These g|F define a piecewise ruled map g : \u03a3 \u2212\u2192 Z homotopic to f . From our\nconstruction of g, for any singular point g(v) of g(\u03a3), there exists an arc \u03b1 in \u03a3 with\nInt \u03b1 3 v and such that g(\u03b1) is a geodesic segment in Z . If g(v) is not an element of\nZ \\ Z , then it is easily seen that the cone-angle of \u03a3 at v is at least 2\u03c0 . So we may\nassume that g(v) is contained in a component l of Z \\ Z . For any sufficiently small\nd > 0, \u03b1 divides the circle Sd (v, \u03a3) into two arcs \u03b31 , \u03b32 . By Lemma 1.1, the \u03bd \u2013length\nof g(\u03b3i ) (i = 1, 2) in Sd (g(v), Z) is at least \u03c0 . Thus, the cone-angle of \u03a3 at v is at least\nb in Z .\n2\u03c0 . This shows that g is a CAT(\u22121)\u2013ruled wrapping of \u2206\nNote that Theorem 0.1 is proved quite similarly to Proposition 2.1 by considering (N, \u2206)\nb\ninstead of (Z, \u2206).\n\n3\n\nCompact cores and end reductions\n\nA 3\u2013manifold X is topologically tame if there exists an embedding f : X \u2212\u2192 Y into a\ncompact manifold Y with f (X) \u2283 Int Y . Throughout this section, we suppose that M\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\fExistence of ruled wrappings in hyperbolic 3\u2013manifolds\n\n1179\n\nis an orientable, open, irreducible and connected 3\u2013manifold with finitely generated\nfundamental group. An end E of M is said to be topologically tame if there exits a\nclosed neighborhood of E in M homeomorphic to S \u00d7 [0, \u221e) for some closed connected\nsurface S. It is easily seen that the open 3\u2013manifold M is topologically tame if and\nonly if each end of M is so.\nScott [10] proved that M contains a 3\u2013dimensional submanifold C, called a compact\ncore of M , such that the inclusion i : C \u2212\u2192 M is a homotopy equivalence. Let S be\ne \u2212\u2192 M the covering associated\nthe component of \u2202C facing an end E of M , and p : M\ne of M\ne\ne such that \u2202 C\nwith the image of \u03c01 (S) in \u03c01 (M).

In particular, when E is a 3\u2013ball,\ne is a handlebody. Note that the end Ee of M\ne faced by e\nthe compression body C\nS is\ntopologically tame if and only if E is also.\ne such\nLet \u2206 = \u03b41 \u222a * * * \u222a \u03b4i0 be an i0 \u2013component link in the compression body C\ne Z) and\nthat [\u03b4k ] (k = 1, * * * , i0 \u2212 1) form a basis for the free abelian group H1 (C,\n[\u03b4i0 ] = [\u03b41 ] + * * * + [\u03b4i0 \u22121 ].

The paper is useful also as an expository article on end reductions.\nA compact, connected, 3\u2013dimensional submanifold R of M is regular if M \\ R is\nirreducible and the closure of any component of M \\ R in M is not compact.

According to Myers [9, Theorem 9.2], if the link \u2206 is algebraically\ndisk-busting, then an end reduction V of M at \u2206 is connected and the homomorphism\ni\u2217 : \u03c01 (V) \u2212\u2192 \u03c01 (M) induced from the inclusion is an isomorphism.\n\n4\n\nProof of Marden's Conjecture\n\nOur proof of Marden's Conjecture is based on that of Calegari\u2013Gabai [5], but the\nimportance of the disk-busting property is suggested by Agol [1]. For simplicity, we\nonly consider hyperbolic 3\u2013manifolds without parabolic cusps. It is not hard to modify\nour argument for the case of manifolds with parabolic cusps.\nTheorem 4.1 (Marden's Tameness Conjecture) Let N be an orientable hyperbolic 3\u2013\nmanifold without parabolic cusps. If \u03c01 (N) is finitely generated, then N is topologically\ntame.\nFirst of all, we fix the setting for the proof. It suffices to show that each end E of\nN is topologically tame. As was seen in Section 3, we may assume that a compact\ncore C of N is a compression body. Let S be the component of \u2202C facing E . If E\nis geometrically finite, that is, C is locally convex in S, then it is well known that E\nis topologically tame, for example see Marden [8]. So we may assume that E is not\ngeometrically finite. Then Bonahon [2] shows that there exists a sequence {\u03b4i } of\nclosed geodesics in N exiting E . If necessary, by adding finitely many closed geodesics\nto {\u03b4i } one can suppose that \u2206i = \u03b41 \u222a * * * \u222a \u03b4i is algebraically disk-busting for all\ni not less than some fixed integer i0 > 0. If necessarily, by slightly deforming the\nS\nhyperbolic metric in a small neighborhood of i \u03b4i in N we may assume that the closed\ngeodesics \u03b4i are simple and mutually disjoint, ie, each \u2206i is a link in N . In fact, the\nresulting metric is no longer hyperbolic but pinched negatively curved. However, all the\nresults concerting hyperbolic manifolds which we need, eg Proposition 2.1 in Section 2,\nstill hold under this metric if we replace CAT(\u22121) with CAT(\u2212a2 ), where \u2212a2 is the\nsupremum of sectional curvatures of N with respect to the new metric. We refer to\nCanary [6, Sections 4 and 5] for standard arguments on such a metric deformation.\nFor any i \u2265 i0 , let Vi be an end reduction of N at \u2206i . By [9], the \u03c01 \u2013homomorphism\ninduced from the inclusion Vi \u2212\u2192 N is an isomorphism. It follows that a compact core\nCi of Vi is also a compact core of N , and each \u03b4k (k = 1, . . . , i) is freely homotopic\nin Vi to a loop of Ci . By property (ii) of the end reduction Vi , there exists a regular\nsubmanifold Wi of Vi containing both Ci and the traces of these free homotopies\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\fExistence of ruled wrappings in hyperbolic 3\u2013manifolds\n\n1181\n\nin Ci and such that \u2202Wi is incompressible in N \\ \u2206i . In fact, Rn in Section 3 with\nsufficiently large n satisfies the properties of Wi . Since the inclusion Ci \u2212\u2192 Wi \u2212\u2192 N\nis \u03c01 \u2013isomorphic, \u03c01 (Ci ) can be regarded as a subgroup of \u03c01 (Wi ). Consider the\ncovering pi : Xi \u2212\u2192 Wi associated to \u03c01 (Ci ) \u2282 \u03c01 (Wi ). Let \u03b4bk be a component of\nb b\nb\nb\nb\np\u22121\ni (\u03b4k ) such that pi |\u03b4k : \u03b4k \u2212\u2192 \u03b4k is homeomorphic, and let \u2206i = \u03b41 \u222a * * * \u222a \u03b4i . The\n\u2022\ncomponent Si of \u2202Ci facing E has a lift Si to Xi which is also a boundary component\nof a compact core of Xi .\nLemma 4.2 Xi is topologically tame.\nProof The claim in [5, page 426] shows that Wi is an atoroidal manifold such that \u2202Wi\nhas a component of genus greater than 1. This fact together with Canary [6] proves that\nXi is topologically tame.\nHere, we will give an another proof without invoking the atoroidality of Wi . First we\noutline the proof. Divide the covering pi : Xi \u2212\u2192 Wi to restricted coverings associated\nwith a torus decomposition of Wi . By finite generation, all but finitely many restrictions\nare universal coverings. By a result in Waldhausen [14], the total spaces of such\nuniversal coverings are topologically tame. Other total spaces cover atoroidal Haken\nmanifolds with non-torus boundary component, and hence they are topologically tame.\nSince Xi is obtained by attaching topologically tame manifolds to each other along\nsimply connected boundary components, Simon's Combination Theorem [11] shows\nthat Xi is also topologically tame.\nMore precisely, let Ti = T1 \u222a * * * \u222a Tm be a maximal union of mutually disjoint and\nnonparallel incompressible tori in Int Wi . Since Wi is regular and N is atoroidal and\nirreducible, each Tj bounds a compact manifold Aj which is contained in a 3\u2013ball\nin N and homeomorphic to the exterior of a nontrivial knot in S3 . Either any two\nAj are mutually disjoint or one of them contains the other. Set A = A1 \u222a * * * \u222a Am .\nb of p\u22121\nb\nNote that, for any component A\ni (A), the image inci \u25e6 pi (A) is contained in a\n3\u2013ball in N , where inci : Wi \u2212\u2192 N is the inclusion. Since inci \u25e6 pi : Xi \u2212\u2192 N is\nb is simply connected. Then A\nb is topologically tame\n\u03c01 \u2013isomorphic, it follows that A\nb is simply connected, p\u22121\nby [14, Theorem 8.1]. Since each component of \u2202 A\ni (\u2202A)\ninduces a free decomposition of \u03c01 (Xi ). The classical Grushko Theorem implies that the\nb of p\u22121\nfundamental group of any component B\ni (Wi \\ Int A) is finitely generated. Since\nWi \\ Int A is an atoroidal Haken manifold such that one of the boundary components has\nb is topologically tame by [6, Proposition 3.2]. In the present\ngenus greater than 1, Int B\nb is also topologically tame. See Soma [12] for a more\ncase, it is not hard to show that B\ngeneral case. Finally, Theorem 3.1 in [11] implies that Xi is topologically tame.\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1182\n\nTeruhiko Soma\n\nProof of Theorem 4.1 By Lemma 4.2, Xi is realized as the interior of a compact\nmanifold X i . Let Si be the component of \u2202X i facing Si\u2022 in Xi , and b\nSi a closed surface\nSi is 2\u2013incompressible\nin Int Xi obtained by a small isotopy of Si in X i . We show that b\nb i . If not, there would exist a compressing disk D for Si in X i such that\nin Xi rel. \u2206\nb i consists of at most one point. If D separates Xi , then \u03c01 (Xi )\nthe intersection D \u2229 \u2206\nhas a nontrivial free decomposition A \u2217 B each factor of which is isomorphic to the\nfundamental group of a component of Xi \\ D. Otherwise, \u03c01 (Xi ) is isomorphic to\nb i = \u2205, any element of \u03c01 (Xi ) represented\nA \u2217 Z with A = \u03c01 (Xi \\ D).

When D \u2229 \u03b4bj =\nby a component of \u2206\n6 \u2205 for\nb\nb\nsome component \u03b4j of \u2206i , one can suppose that the cyclic factor Z is generated by\nb i \\ \u03b4bj\nthe element represented by \u03b4bj . Any element represented by a component of \u2206\nb\nis conjugate into A. It follows that \u2206i is not algebraically disk-busting in Xi .

Thus l is not\ncontractible in Z i , and hence q\u0304i (l) is contained in the \u03b5\u2013thin part Nthin(\u03b5) of N . From this\nfact together with Bounded Diameter Lemma [5, Lemma 1.15] for CAT(\u2212a2 )\u2013surfaces,\nwe know that the diameter of any component of \u03a3i \\ Nthin(\u03b5) is less than a constant\nindependent of i. Let \u03b1\nbi be a ray in Z i beginning at \u03b4bi and covering a proper ray \u03b1i in\nN such that the sequence {\u03b1i } exits E . Since the algebraic intersection number of \u03b1\nbi\nb\nb\nwith Si is one, \u03a3i \u2229 \u03b1\nbi and hence \u03a3i \u2229 \u03b1i are not empty. This shows that {\u03a3i } exits\nE .
