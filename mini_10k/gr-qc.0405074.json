Physics,\nMax-Wien-Platz 1, 07743 Jena, Germany\nmeinel@tpi.uni-jena.de\n\nAbstract\nIt is shown that the extreme Kerr black hole is the only candidate for a\nblack hole limit of rotating fluid bodies in equilibrium.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe gravitational collapse of a spherically symmetric star to the Schwarzschild black\nhole is well understood. The idealized model of dust collapse described by Oppenheimer and Snyder [1] provides a famous analytic example. In contrast, the belief\nthat the collapse of a rotating star leads finally to the Kerr black hole relies on\nPenrose's cosmic censorship hypothesis combined with the black hole uniqueness\ntheorems (see [2, 3]) and has not been rigorously proved so far. As a step in this direction we want to discuss in this paper the possibility of a quasistationary collapse\nto the Kerr black hole, i.e. the possibility of sequences of equilibrium configurations of stars approaching a black hole limit continuously. Of course, the surface\nof a stationary star can never become identical with a black hole horizon since the\nhorizon is a null hypersurface. The question is, however, whether it is possible to\ncome arbitrarily close to this limit. In the nonrotating, i.e. spherically symmetric\ncase, the answer is \"no\". Under the reasonable assumption, that the mass-energy\ndensity is non-negative and does not increase outwards, the circumferential radius\nr\u2217 of a static fluid sphere of total mass M always satisfies the \"Buchdahl inequality\" r\u2217 > (9/8) rs , where rs = 2M is the corresponding Schwarzschild radius (see,\nfor example, [4]). Consequently, the relative redshift of photons emitted from the\nsurface of the star and received at infinity is bounded by the value 2.\nIn the following, we consider stationary and axisymmetric, uniformly rotating\nperfect fluid configurations with a \"cold\" equation of state1 and their possible connection to black holes. The relevant basic equations can be found, for example, in\n[5] \u2013 [11]. We use units where the speed of light c as well as Newton's gravitational\nconstant G are equal to 1 and choose the spacetime signature (\u2212 + ++).\n\n2\n\nEquilibrium stellar models, Kerr black holes and their\npossible connection\n\nIn this chapter we shall analyse necessary parameter relations for a possible connection between equilibrium stellar models and Kerr black holes. Therefore we have to\nprovide some basic relations for rotating fluids in equilibrium.\nThe four-velocity of the fluid must point in the direction of a linear combination\nof the two Killing vectors \u03be = \u2202/\u2202t and \u03b7 = \u2202/\u2202\u03c6 corresponding to stationarity and\naxisymmetry:\nui = e\u2212V (\u03be i + \u03a9 \u03b7 i ),\n1\n\n\u03a9 = constant.\n\nThe results are valid for isentropic stellar models with non-zero temperature as well.\n\n2\n\n(1)\n\n\fThe Killing vector \u03be is fixed by its normalization \u03be i \u03bei \u2192 \u22121 at spatial infinity (we\nassume asymptotic flatness). The orbits of the spacelike Killing vector \u03b7 are closed\nand \u03b7 is zero on the axis of symmetry. \u03a9 = u\u03c6 /ut is the angular velocity of the fluid\nbody with respect to infinity. The factor e\u2212V = ut follows from ui ui = \u22121:\n(\u03be i + \u03a9 \u03b7 i )(\u03bei + \u03a9 \u03b7i ) = \u2212e2V .\n\n(2)\n\nThe energy-momentum tensor is given by\nTik = (\u01eb + p) ui uk + p gik ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the mass-energy density \u01eb and the pressure p are related by a \"cold\" equation\nof state, \u01eb = \u01eb(p), following from\np = p(\u03c1, T ),\n\n\u01eb = \u01eb(\u03c1, T ),\n\n\u03c1: baryonic mass-density\n\n(4)\n\nfor T = 0. The specific enthalpy\nh=\n\n\u01eb+p\n\u03c1\n\n(5)\n\ncan be calculated as follows:\n1\n1\ndh = T ds + dp = dp,\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\u21d2\n\ndh\ndp\n=\nh\n\u01eb+p\n\ns: specific entropy\n\n\uf8ee p\nZ\n\u21d2 h(p) = h(0) exp \uf8f0\n0\n\ndp\u2032\n\u01eb(p\u2032 ) + p\u2032\n\n(6)\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fb.\n\n(7)\n\nNote that h(0) = 1 for most equations of state. For our conclusions, however, it will\nbe sufficient to assume h(0) < \u221e. From T ik ;k = 0 we obtain\nh(p) eV = h(0) eV0 = constant,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere V0 , the constant surface value (corresponding to p = 0) of the function V\ndefined in (2), is related to the relative redshift z of zero angular momentum photons2\nemitted from the surface of the fluid and received at infinity:\nz = e\u2212V0 \u2212 1.\n\n(9)\n\nEquilibrium models, for a given equation of state, are fixed by two parameters, for\nexample \u03a9 and V0 . The total mass M and angular momentum J are given by\nM =2\n\nZ\n\u03a3\n\n2\n\n1\n(Tik \u2212 T gik )ni \u03be k dV,\n2\n\nJ =\u2212\n\nZ\n\nTik ni \u03b7 k dV,\n\n\u03a3\n\nThis means \u03b7i pi = 0 (pi : four-momentum of the photon).\n\n3\n\n(10)\n\n\fwhere\n\u03a3 is a spacelike hypersurface (t = constant) with the volume element dV =\nq\n(3) g d3 x\n\nand the future pointing unit normal ni , see [4]. The baryonic mass M0\ncorresponding to the local conservation law (\u03c1ui );i = 0 is\nM0 = \u2212\n\nZ\n\n\u03c1 ui ni dV.\n\n(11)\n\n\u03a3\n\nNote that nearby equilibrium configurations with the same equation of state are\nrelated by [5, 6]\n\u03b4M = \u03a9 \u03b4J + h(0) eV0 \u03b4M0 .\n\n(12)\n\nIn contrast to the non-rotating case, where Birkhoff's theorem implies that the\nexterior spacetime is always given by the Schwarzschild metric, the exterior metric\nof a rotating star is not Kerr in general. However, we now want to ask whether it\nis possible to approach a situation where the surface of the star becomes \"almost\"\nthe horizon of a Kerr black hole. First we note that the black hole horizon is\ncharacterized by a linear combination \u03be + \u03a9H \u03b7 of the two Killing vectors which is\nnull [10], where \u03a9H is the \"angular velocity of the horizon\":\n(\u03be i + \u03a9H \u03b7 i )(\u03bei + \u03a9H \u03b7i ) = 0 with\n\u03a9H =\n\nJ\n2M 2\n\nh\n\nM+\n\np\n\nM 2 \u2212 (J/M )2\n\n(13)\ni.\n\n(14)\n\nSince all other linear combinations \u03be + \u03a9 \u03b7 of the Killing vectors become spacelike\non the horizon the desired black hole limit can only be approached for\n\u03a9 = \u03a9H .\n\n(15)\n\nBecause of (2) and (8), the surface of the fluid is characterized in general by\n(\u03be i + \u03a9 \u03b7 i )(\u03bei + \u03a9 \u03b7i ) = \u2212e2V0 .\n\n(16)\n\nA black hole limit therefore requires\nV0 \u2192 \u2212\u221e\n\n(z \u2192 \u221e).\n\n(17)\n\nA combination of (10) and (11) leads to the formula\nM = 2\u03a9J +\n\nZ\n\n\u01eb + 3p V\ne dM0 ,\n\u03c1\n\n(18)\n\ncf. equation (II.28) in [6]. With (5) and (8) we get finally\nV0\n\nM = 2\u03a9J + h(0) e\n\nZ\n\n\u01eb + 3p\ndM0 .\n\u01eb+p\n\n(19)\n4\n\n\fSince (\u01eb + 3p)/(\u01eb + p) \u2264 3 (the weak energy condition is sufficient for this) the\nsecond term on the right-hand side of the last equation is bounded by 3h(0) eV0 M0 .\nConsequently, for finite h(0) and finite baryonic mass M0 , the limit V0 \u2192 \u2212\u221e\nimplies\nM = 2\u03a9J.\n\n(20)\n\nTogether with (14) and (15) this leads to our conclusion that the only possible\ncandidate for a black hole limit of fluid bodies in equilibrium is the \"extreme\" Kerr\nblack hole characterized by the maximal possible value of |J|/M 2 , i.e.\nJ = \u00b1M 2 .\n\n3\n\n(21)\n\nDiscussion\n\nNow that we have shown that the extreme Kerr black hole is the only candidate,\nwe want to discuss if and how this limit can be reached. In the case of a rotating,\ninfinitesimally thin disc, strong numerical evidence for this transition was found by\nBardeen and Wagoner [6] who were also able to establish its nature. Neugebauer\nand Meinel [12, 13], see also [14], confirmed these results in finding and analysing the\nexact solution to the disc problem. Hence, the existence of a continuous connection\nof equilibrium fluid configurations to the extreme Kerr black hole has been proved.\n(Note that the disc is a limiting case of a rotating fluid for p/\u01eb \u2192 0.)\nThe horizon of the extreme Kerr black hole has an infinite proper distance from\nany place in the exterior region characterized, in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates, by\nr > M . Indeed, the r > M part of the extreme Kerr metric results from the\nlimit V0 \u2192 \u2212\u221e of the disc solution in the \"exterior\", asymptotically flat region. A\ndifferent limit is obtained, however, if the limit is taken in rescaled and corotating\ncoordinates corresponding to r = M . The resulting \"inner world\" contains the disc\nand is not asymptotically flat but approaches the \"extreme Kerr throat geometry\"\n[15] at spatial infinity. Strictly speaking, there is not yet a horizon. The \"inner\" and\nthe \"outer\" world are separated by the \"throat region\", which is also characterized\nby r = M . In this subtle way the black hole limit is realized. Presumably, a small\nperturbation will lead to a genuine Kerr black hole with |J| slightly less than M 2 .\nIt should be possible to prove that the above scenario holds whenever the limit\nV0 \u2192 \u2212\u221e of a rotating fluid body is attainable. A further example has already been\ngiven by the \"relativistic Dyson rings\" [16], see also [17]. Other ring solutions with\na variety of equations of state also exhibit this limit [18, 19].\nA perturbation analysis based on this quasistationary, \"maximally rotating\"\nroute to the Kerr black hole may lead to some insight into the dynamical collapse\nof rotating stars supplementary to the investigations close to the non-rotating case.\n5\n\n\fI gratefully acknowledge the many inspiring discussions with G.
