Those obstacles results in the increase of yield\nstress and therefore play an important role in irradiation hardening. To investigate the extent of hardening\nby those obstacles, there has been a model in which a\ndislocation is regarded as a continuous line with a constant line tension. This is referred to as the uniform line\ntension model. In the presence of obstacles, a dislocation\nis fixed to form a cusp at an obstacle. The pinning angle\n\u03c6 is defined as the angle between two tangent vectors at\na cusp. (See FIG. 1). Then the restoring force to make a\ndislocation straight is written as 2\u03b3 cos(\u03c6/2), where \u03b3 denotes the line tension. We assume that a dislocation can\npenetrate an obstacle when the restoring force exceeds\nthe critical value. Since \u03b3 is a constant, this condition\nis equivalent to \u03c6 \u2264 \u03c6c , which we call the critical angle.\nNote that stronger obstacles have smaller critical angles.\nA dislocation bows out to form an arc between two obstacles until the pinning angle reaches its critical value.\nFor a periodic array of obstacles whose spacing is L,\nthe critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) \u03c4c above which\na dislocation can penetrate the array of obstacles is represented by\n\u03c4c =\n\n2\u03b3\n\u03c6c\ncos ,\nbL\n2\n\n(1)\n\nline tension\ndislocation\n\n\u03c6\nobstacle\n\nFIG. 1: A cusp formed at an obstacle. The angle \u03c6 between\ntwo tangential vectors is called the pinning angle.\n\nwhere b denotes the Burgers vector length of the dislocation. (The line tension \u03b3 is given by the elastic theory\nand is often written as Gb2 /2, where G represents the\nshear modulus.)\nIn more realistic situations, obstacles are distributed\nrandomly on glide planes and the randomness plays a\ncrucial role in dislocation dynamics. In order to incorporate this effect, Foreman and Makin performed computer\nsimulation of the dislocation motion on a glide plane with\nrandomly distributed obstacles which have the same critical angle [1]. They found that the dislocation propagation has two qualitatively different modes depending on\nthe critical angle. For obstacles of a small critical angle (i.e. strong obstacles), the dislocation propagation\nresembles dendritic growth [2], while for a large critical\nangle (i.e. weak obstacles) the global form does not significantly deviate from the straight line. Also \u03c4c are well\ndescribed by [3]\n\n\u03c4c =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n\n\u0010\n\n2\u03b3\nbL\n1.6\u03b3\nbL\n\ncos \u03c62c\n\n\u0011 32\n\n, (\u03c6c \u2265 59 \u03c0)\n\ncos \u03c62c , (\u03c6c \u2264 59 \u03c0)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere L denotes the inverse of the square root of the\nareal density of obstacles on a glide plane [4].\nIn this context, the critical angle \u03c6c , which characterizes the obstacle strength, is an important parameter\nto discuss the extent of hardening. However, estimation\nof the critical angle is not an easy task, because it involves the core structure of dislocations. In this regard,\nextensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the\ninteraction between a dislocation and radiation-induced\nobstacles have been performed: e.g. stacking fault tetrahedra [5], interstitial Frank loops [6], voids and copper\nprecipitates in bcc iron [7, 8, 9].\nOn the other hand, there are some experimental attempts to determine the critical angle utilizing transmission electron microscopy (TEM) [10, 11]. They seem to\nbe promising but still should be complemented by MD\n\n\f2\n\nmoving layers\n\nvoid\n\nburgers\nvector\n(111)\nZ\n[111]\n\nfixed layers\n\nX [11-2]\nY [1-10]\n\nFIG. 2: Schematic of the system. Periodic boundary conditions are assigned to the x and the y directions. The system\ncontains approximately 0.55 million atoms.\n\nsimulations in terms of the spatial resolution. For example, subnanometer obstacles cannot be seen by TEM.\nIn this paper, along the line of the above computational and experimental studies, we wish to estimate the\ncritical angle and the critical stress regarding voids in\ncopper. Especially, effects of the dissociation, temperature, and the distance from the void center to a glide\nplane are studied in detail. Note that we focus on an\nedge dislocation here. Results on a screw dislocation will\nbe presented elsewhere.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In the section II, we\nintroduce the computational model; fcc copper including\nan edge dislocation and a void. In the section III, the\nnature of the critical stress is investigated. Especially,\nvoid size dependence and the temperature dependence is\ndiscussed. The section IV deals with the critical angle,\nwhich is often measured by experiments (mainly TEM\nobservation) to determine the obstacle strength. The discussion enables us to compare the MD simulation with\nthe experiments. In the section V, effects of the distance\nbetween the void center and a glide plane are investigated. In the section VI, we discuss pinning strength\nof deformed voids in the context of dislocation channeling and plastic flow localization. The last section VII is\ndevoted to discussions and conclusions.\n\nII.\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nA.\n\nthe geometry\n\nare periodically located in the y direction.\nNote that we have the surface only in the z direction,\nboth for z > 0 and for z < 0. Following [14], three atomic\nlayers of [111] next to the lowest surface (z < 0) are \"the\nfixed layers\" where velocities of the atoms always vanish.\nSimilarly, three atomic layers of [111] next to the upper\nsurface (z > 0) are \"the moving layers\" where velocities\nof the atoms are not given by the integration of force\nacting on them, but are given as a constant to cause\nthe shear stress. Namely, the strain rate is the control\nparameter: not the shear stress. The moving surface\nmoves to the \u2212y direction: i.e. [1\u030410].\nIn order to introduce a void, atoms whose barycentric\npositions are in the spherical region (x\u00b1L/2)2 +y 2 +z 2 <\nr2 are removed, where r denotes the radius of the void.\nTo introduce an edge dislocation, atoms that belong to\none (11\u03040) half plane (z < 0) are removed and the rest of\natoms are displaced by the strain field calculated from\nthe elastic theory. This procedure produces a perfect\nedge dislocation whose Burgers vector is a/2[11\u03040]. However, a perfect dislocation in an fcc crystal is energetically unstable to split into two\n\u221apartial dislocations whose\nBurgers vector length b is a/ 6 = 1.48 \u00c5.\na\na\na\n[1\u030410] \u2192 [2\u030411] + [1\u030421\u0304].\n(3)\n2\n6\n6\nSince we wish to prepare two partial dislocations and a\nvoid in an initial system, atoms are suitably shifted from\nthe original position by the steepest descent method in\norder to realize the dissociation. In addition, since our\nsystem consists of the periodic array of dislocations due\nto the periodic boundary conditions in the x direction,\nthis procedure also incorporates the excess strain field\ncaused by the next dislocations. After certain time steps,\nthe perfect dislocation dissociates to yield two partial\ndislocations separated by approximately 4 nm.\nTemperature is fixed to be 300 K in this paper, except for the section III C where the temperature effect on the CRSS is investigated. Velocities of atoms\nare given by random numbers which obey the MaxwellBoltzmann distribution. After a relatively short time required for phonon relaxation, \"the moving layer\", which\nis explained above, begins to displace to cause strain.\nB.\n\nWe treat fcc copper in this paper. As for the interatomic potential, we adopt the embedded-atom method\nof Finnis-Sinclair type [12] and choose the parameters\naccording to Ackland et al. [13]. The lattice constant\na = 3.615 \u00c5.\nThe schematic of our system is shown in FIG. 2. The\nx, y, and z axes are taken as the [112\u0304], [11\u03040], and [111]\ndirections, respectively. The length of each dimension is\n23nm, 23nm, and 15 nm. Periodic boundary conditions\nare employed in the x and the y directions. That is, we\nconsider dislocations of infinite length in the x direction\n\nthe strain rate\n\nThe strain rate \u01eb\u0307 is an important parameter in MD simulations of dislocations. In this paper, we set \u01eb\u0307 = 8 \u00d7 106\n[sec\u22121 ]. Although it seems still unrealistically fast deformation, the strain rate in MD simulation should not\nbe directly compared with the macroscopic (or experimental) strain rate because the macroscopic strain rate\ninvolves only the average dislocation velocity. Namely,\nboth spatial and temporal fluctuations in dislocation velocity are neglected. The complete correspondence of microscopic dislocation velocity to the macroscopic strain\nrate is not clear at all unless we know the statistical property of space-time fluctuation in dislocation motion.\n\n\f3\n\nb\nY [1-10]\n\nstress [MPa]\n\n120\n\nY [1-10]\n\na\n\n80\n\n40\n\nX [11-2]\n\nd\n\nY [1-10]\n\nY [1-10]\n\nc\n\nX [11-2]\n\ndepinning\ndepinning\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.002 0.004 0.006 0.008\n\n0.01\n\n0.012 0.014\n\nstrain\nX [11-2]\n\nX [11-2]\n\nFIG. 3: Successive snapshots of a depinning process: (a) trapping of the leading partial, (b) just before the depinning of\nthe leading partial, (c) just before depinning of the trailing\npartial, (d) depinning of the trailing partial. The void radius\nis 1 nm. To visualize the void and the dislocations, atoms that\nhave 12 nearest neighbors are omitted. (Atoms which form\ndislocations have 11 or 13 nearest neighbors, and the number\nof nearest neighbors of void surface atoms is less than 12.)\n\nCalculation of the shear stress is noteworthy. We define the shear stress as the forces in the y direction acting\non the unit area of the moving layers and the fixed layers. However, this microscopic definition of the shear\nstress shows a large thermal fluctuation. In addition,\nthe inertial motion of the dislocation due to the high\nstrain rate may enable depinning at lower stress [7]. In\norder to reduce these effects, simulation is performed\ntwofold. Namely, the representative point in the phase\nspace (spanned by the positions and the momenta of all\natoms) are recorded every 4.6 ps. We then take the point\nwhere depinning just begins and restart the simulation\nwith \u01eb\u0307 = 0. In this relaxation process, the inertial effect is ruled out and the thermal fluctuation in the shear\nstress is averaged out. Taking this relaxation process into\naccount, the average strain rate becomes approximately\n106 [1/sec].\nIII.\n\nBEHAVIORS OF THE CRITICAL\nRESOLVED SHEAR STRESS\nA.\n\ntemporal behavior\n\nFirst, we track the time evolution. Under the shear\nstress caused by the boundary condition, two partial dislocations glide towards the [1\u030410] direction: the \u2212y direction. The Burgers vectors of the leading and the trailing\npartials are [2\u030411] and [1\u030421\u0304], respectively. Snapshots of a\npinning-depinning process are shown in FIG. 3.\nNote that there are two depinning processes of the\nleading and the trailing partials. In the stress-strain relation (FIG. 4), we can see two peaks which correspond\nto the each depinning process. We remark that the crit-\n\nFIG. 4: Stress-strain relation. Two arrows indicate the depinning points of two partials. Two circles which indicate sudden\nstress drops result from the attractive interaction between the\ndislocations and the void.\n\nical stress for the leading partial is always larger than\nthat of the trailing partial. This is because the leading\npartial has already escaped from the void and keeps gliding while the trailing partial is pinned by the void. Then\nthe width of the stacking fault ribbon extends to yield attractive force between the partials. Namely, depinning of\nthe trailing partial is assisted by the attractive force from\nthe leading partial. Also, note that the movement of the\nleading partial leads to the stress relaxation, which appears in the change of modulus in the stress-strain curve\nin FIG. 4. That is, the modulus is 30 GPa when the leading partial is pinned (0.002 < \u01eb < 0.006), whereas the one\nafter the leading partial is unpinned (0.008 < \u01eb < 0.012)\nis 13 GPa.\nB.\n\nvoid size dependence\n\nThen the critical stress is calculated for various voids\nof different radii (from 0.3 to 2.5 nm). We measure the\ndepinning stresses both for the leading partial and for\nthe trailing partial. An interesting feature arises from\nthe comparison of the both stresses, which are shown in\nFIG. 5. We can see that they have different tendencies\nwith respect to the void radius r. The depinning stress of\nthe trailing partial shows the well-known logarithmic dependence, while that of the leading partial (i.e. the yield\nstress) shows a crossover around r \u2243 1 nm. We will discuss the difference more quantitatively in this subsection.\nThe depinning stress of the trailing partial can be described by the following relation.\n\u0015\n\u0014\n2r \u22121\n2r\n,\n(4)\n(1 + )\n\u03c4c = T log\nB\nL\nwhere T and B denote arbitrary constants. The best fit is\nrealized by letting T = 37 MPa and B = 0.14 nm.

(6), which is the result from\na continuous model calculation [15].\n\nalso in the context of the Orowan mechanism [16]. Since\ntheir computation deals with only the critical stresses\nfor pure edge dislocations and screw dislocations, it does\nnot quantitatively apply to the partial dislocations. At\nleast, it can describe the qualitative behavior regarding\nthe trailing partial.\nOn the other hand, the crossover of the yield stress\ncannot be explained in the above context. It seems to be\ndescribable by piecewise logarithmic behavior;\ni\n(\nh\n2r \u22121\n2r\n, (r \u2264 1)\n18 log 1.5\u00d710\n)\n(1\n+\n\u22123\nL\u0003\n\u03c4c =\n(5)\n\u0002 2r\n2r \u22121\n280 log 1.2 (1 + L )\n. (r \u2265 1)\n\nNote that the extent of hardening becomes much greater\nwhen the void radius exceeds 1 nm. Although we cannot show the definite explanation of this phenomenon, a\nplausible reason lies in the interaction between two partials. When the void radius is larger than 1 nm, the two\npartials are simultaneously trapped by the void. Then\nthe depinning of the leading partial may be significantly\naffected by the trailing partial, since the distance between\nthem is very close near the void (a few Burgers vectors).\nNote that, for r = 0.3 nm and 0.5 nm, depinning of\nthe leading partial takes place before the trapping of the\ntrailing partial; i.e. the depinning of the leading partial\nis less affected by the trailing partial. We also remark\nthat a similar crossover due to the interaction between\ndislocations is observed in the critical stress of dislocation\nnucleation on the void surface [17].\nRegardless of the void radius, the depinning of the\ntrailing partial takes place when the leading partial is\ncompletely escaped from the void. Although the trailing partial interacts with the leading partial via stacking\nfault ribbon and the elastic strain, it is not as strong as\nthe one in the depinning process of the leading partial.\nTherefore, it is reasonable that the unpinning stress for\nthe trailing partial can be described in the framework of\n[15] where a single dislocation involves.\n\n0\n\n100\n\n[11-2]\n\n0\n\nFIG. 6: Snapshots of dislocations (the trailing partials) just\nbefore depinning. The trailing partial dislocation at 100 K\nis represented by \u00d7, and the one at 500 K is +. The subtle\ndifference in the middle lies in the range of thermal fluctuation\nat 500 K.\n\nOn the other hand, the yield stress for an edge dislocation should be interpreted as the maximum stress during\nthe whole pinning process including two partials: that is,\nthe critical stress for the leading partial. It is interesting\nto compare the yield stress in the present simulation and\nthe one in [15] in which the dissociation is not taken into\naccount. The yield stress estimated by Scattergood and\nBacon reads\n\u0015\n\u0014\n2r\nGb\n2r\n(6)\nlog\n(1 + )\u22121 ,\n\u03c4SB =\n2\u03c0L\n0.22b\nL\nwhich is also plotted in FIG. 5. We can see that Eq. (6)\nconsiderably overestimates the yield stress where r \u2264 2.5\nnm. Since it does apply to bcc iron [7, 8, 9], we can\nconclude that the dissociation makes depinning easier.\nC.\n\ntemperature dependence\n\nIn this section we investigate temperature dependence\nof the critical stress. We have calculated the critical\nstress for four different temperatures: 100 K, 200 K, 400\nK, and 500 K. However, we cannot find any differences\nregarding the critical stress between these calculations.\nIn FIG. 6 we show the snapshots of dislocations just before depinning where the temperatures are 100 K and 500\nK, respectively. We can see no difference in the dislocation shape. Also, the critical stress is almost the same:\n130 \u00b1 12 MPa for r = 1 nm and 288 \u00b1 30 MPa for r = 2.5\nnm. Namely, temperature plays no role in depinning processes.\nNote that this result is opposite to the simulation on\nbcc iron with a copper precipitate [9]. There, definite\ntemperature dependence was observed from 0 K to 500\nK. The reason for the difference lies in the dissociation\nnature of dislocation. In bcc iron where a dislocation\ndoes not dissociate, a perfect dislocation absorbs vacancies from a void (or the precipitate surface) and undergoes climb motion. The climb motion is remarkable for\n\n\f5\n\nIV.\n\nA.\n\nTHE DISLOCATION SHAPE AND THE\nCRITICAL ANGLE\nan orientation dependent line tension model\n\nAs can be seen in FIG. 3, the bowing dislocation is\nasymmetric with respect to x = 0. Since the uniform\nline tension model predicts the symmetric form (an arc),\nwe have to incorporate an orientation dependent line tension in order to explain the asymmetric dislocation shape.\nIndeed, de Wit and Koehler [18] obtained a solution for\nthe dislocation shape.\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\ndE\ny = C1 +\nE(\u03b8) cos \u03b4 \u2212\nsin \u03b4 ,\n(7)\n\u03c3b\nd\u03b8\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\ndE\nx = C2 +\nE(\u03b8) sin \u03b4 +\ncos \u03b4 ,\n(8)\n\u03c3b\nd\u03b8\nwhere \u03b4 denotes the angle between the tangent line of\na dislocation and the x axis. An orientation dependent\nline tension is denoted by E(\u03b8), in which \u03b8 represents\nthe angle between the tangent line of the dislocation and\nthe Burgers vector. If the concrete form of E(\u03b8) is given,\nthese equations can be numerically solved with an appropriate choice of the arbitrary constants C1 and C2 . Here,\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\nd\n\nY [1-10]\n\n0\n-2\n-4\n-6\n0\n-4\n-8\n\nY [1-10]\n\nlarger voids where temperature dependence of the critical depinning stress is observed. Note that smaller voids\nshow less temperature dependence and the climb motion\nis weak there. It implies that the climb motion is essential to the temperature dependence. On the other hand,\nno climb motion is observed in the present simulation. It\nis known that the climb motion is difficult in fcc crystals\nsince dislocations dissociate. Therefore, no temperature\ndependence is observed in the present simulation on fcc\ncopper.\nAnother possible reason lies in the activation energy\nfor depinning. Although the precise estimation of the activation energy is difficult, it is at least larger than the\nenergy of a dislocation whose length is equivalent to the\nvoid diameter. (We neglect the step formation energy on\nthe void surface.) Dislocation energy is calculated by the\nline tension multiplied by the length. The effective line\ntension is estimated to be 0.4 nN by Eq. (12). (Please see\nthe next section for the detail.) Therefore, for the void\nof 2.0 nm radius, the activation energy is approximately\nestimated as 1.6 \u00d7 10\u221218 J. It is equivalent to 400 kB T ,\nwhere kB denotes the Boltzmann constant and T = 300\nK. Since this is much larger than the thermal energy of\ninvolved atoms on the void surface (less than a hundred),\nit is plausible that thermal fluctuations cannot assist dislocation depinning. In addition, please recall that the\nstep formation energy is neglected and the actual value\nmay be larger than that. However, in the case of precipitates, the number of involving atoms is larger than\nin voids. That may be another reason for the difference\nbetween the present simulation and the one of [9].\n\nX [11-2]\n\nX [11-2]\n\nFIG. 7: Bowing dislocations obtained by the simulation for\nvarious voids (a: r = 1.0 nm, b: r = 1.5 nm, c: r = 2.0 nm,\nd: r = 2.5 nm.) The solid lines represent Eqs. (7) and (8),\nwhich are derived from an orientation dependent line tension\nmodel. Note that the trailing partials also deform to a certain\ndegree as the void becomes larger.\n\nE(\u03b8) is given as [18]\n\u0012 \u0013\nb2\nR\nE(\u03b8) =\nf (\u03b8),\n(9)\nlog\n4\u03c0\nr0\nf (\u03b8) \u2243 59.3 \u2212 16 cos 2\u03b8 \u2212 0.8 cos 4\u03b8, [GPa] (10)\nwhere r0 is the (arbitrary) core cutoff length. In FIG. 7,\nEqs. (9) and (10) are fitted with the simulation result.\nWe can see that the fittings are quite satisfactory.\n\nB.\n\ndetermination of the critical angle\n\nIn macroscopic materials, random configuration of obstacles plays an important role in the dislocation dynamics, as was discussed in the section I. In order to apply\nEq. (2) to a practical situation, we wish to estimate the\ncritical angle from the simulation. Note that the critical\nangle \u03c6c is defined by the angle between two tangent lines\nof the dislocation at the void surface. Because the critical\nangles are slightly different for two partial dislocations,\nwe measure the both.\nThe pinning strength \u03b1 = cos(\u03c6c /2) with respect to\nthe void radius is shown in FIG. 8. We remark that the\npinning strength \u03b1 again obeys a logarithmic law.\n\u03b1 = A log\n\n2r\nB(1 +\n\n2r .\nL)\n\n(11)\n\nThe constants are A = 0.24 and B = 0.07 for the leading\npartial, and A = 0.28 and B = 0.15 for the trailing partial. By extrapolation, \u03b1 reaches 1 when the void radius\nexceeds 3 nm, as shown in FIG. 8. Note that the tendency has also been observed in the previous simulations\non bcc iron [7, 8, 9].\n\n\f6\n1\n\nd\nglide plane\n\n0.8\n\n\u03b1\n\nvoid\n\nr\n\n0\n\n0.6\n\nFIG. 10: The impact parameter d is defined by the distance\nfrom the void center to the glide plane.

For larger voids, the\ntrailing partial is also pinned by the void and bends during the depinning process of the leading partial, as can be\nseen in FIG. 7.

Those\nof the leading partial and of the trailing partial are represented by \u00d7 and +, respectively. Note that the void radius\ndependence results from the difference in the configuration of\ndislocations: the degree of bowing and the interactions of two\npartials.\n\nMeanwhile, it should be remarked that a crossover is\nnot observed in the pinning strength \u03b1. From Eq. (1),\nthe crossover of \u03c4c should be attributed to that of \u03b3,\nwhich can be written as\n\u03b3=\n\nb\u03c4c L\n.\n2\u03b1\n\n(12)\n\nThe calculated line tensions are shown in FIG. 9, in which\nthe line tension of the leading partial shows the minimum\nat r = 1.0 nm while that of the trailing partial monotonically decreases. The explanation for the decrease lies\nin the deformations (i.e. bowouts) of dislocations. As\nthe void gets larger from r = 0, the extent of bowout\nbecomes greater. This results in the prevalence of the\nscrew component, since the partial dislocation is initially\nedge-like. The deformation lowers the effective line tension: i.e. the energy per unit length. (However, the total\nenergy increases due to the elongation.) The above mechanism also explains the decrease of the line tension of the\n\nEFFECTS OF THE IMPACT PARAMETER\n\nSo far, we have limited ourselves to the situation where\na dislocation penetrates the void center. This is rather a\nspecial case, because the relative position of a void to a\nglide plane may be arbitrary. In this section, we change\nthe distance between the void center and a glide plane.\nWe call the distance \"the impact parameter\", which is\ndenoted by d. (See FIG. 10.)\nThe pinning strength \u03b1 is determined for the various\nimpact parameters. The result is shown in FIG. 11, which\nshows asymmetric dependence of \u03b1 on d. Note that the\ndislocation is pinned even when it is not in contact with\nthe void. It implies that, as well as the core energy, the\nelastic strain around the dislocation plays an important\nrole in pinning processes. In addition, the asymmetry\nregarding d = 0 comes from the nature of strain field\naround an edge dislocation: i.e. existence of hydrostatic\npressure caused by the extra atomic plane. Especially,\nthe fact that pinning strength for d > 0 becomes considerably weak suggests that the hydrostatic pressure is\ndominant over the shear stress.\nAlso, we remark that strong pinning (\u03b1 \u2265 0.5) occurs\nonly where \u22121.0r \u2264 d \u2264 0: i.e. the lower half of the void.\nThis area accounts for approximately 30 or 40 percent\nof the whole pinning region, while the rest involves relatively weak pinning. The large variance of the pinning\nstrength distribution for a single void suggests the reconsideration of the same pinning strength assumption in\ndislocation dynamics simulations. In the section VII, we\ndiscuss how to incorporate this effect into the estimation\nof the CRSS in the framework of Eq. (2).\n\n\f7\n1\n\na)\n\nNb\n\n0.8\n0.6\n\n\u03b1\n\nvoid\n\nglide plane\n\n0.4\n\nb)\n\n0.2\n0\n\nvoid\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\nd [nm]\n\n1\n\n2\n\nFIG. 11: Impact parameter dependence of the pinning\nstrength \u03b1 for the trailing partial. Void radius is 1.0 nm\n(indicated by the dashed lines).\n\nVI. EFFECTS OF VOID DEFORMATION\nAFTER THE PASSAGE OF SEVERAL\nDISLOCATIONS\n\nWhen a void is sheared by a dislocation, two parts\nwhich are divided by the glide plane are displaced to\neach other by the Burgers vector. After the passages of\nseveral dislocations, it may collapse and lose the pinning\nability. For example, collapse of stacking fault tetrahedra\nby the passage of dislocations is both experimentally [20]\nand computationally [5] observed. This phenomenon is\nbelieved to be responsible for the formation of dislocation channel and the localization of plastic flow, which\nrecently invokes attention including some computational\nstudies [19]. In this section, effects of the void deformation on pinning strength are discussed based on the\nmotivation described above.\nWe remark that another possible mechanism of the\nvoid deformation is vacancy absorption by (and the climb\nmotion of) an edge dislocation, as was discussed in the\nsection III C. However, no climb motion was seen in our\nsimulations, because the climb is difficult in fcc metals\ndue to its dissociation. Hence, we do not consider the\nvoid contraction by the vacancy emission to dislocations.\nWe concentrate on the effect of the relative deformation\nwith respect to a glide plane.\nWe prepare the deformed void as shown in FIG. 12.\nFirst we prepare a spherical void. Then, instead of iterating the pinning simulations, atoms located above the\nglide plane are displaced by the Burgers vector a/2[1\u030410].\nIterating this procedure for N times is equivalent to the\npassage of N edge dislocations. We set two configurations. In the case (a), the glide plane on which the dislocations move is assumed to be at the void center, whereas\nglide planes are uniformly distributed in the case (b).\nIn the case (a), we set N = 5 and N = 10. Namely,\nthe void is assumed to be penetrated by dislocations on\nthe same glide plane 5 times or 10 times. The pinning\nstrength \u03b1 is found to be 0.7 for the both cases, which\nis almost the same value with the one for the spherical\nvoid. This is consistent with the result obtained in the\n\nFIG. 12: Schematic of the void deformation by the passages\nof N edge dislocations: a) There is a single glide plane which\ncuts the void center. b) Glide planes are uniformly distributed. Each planes has N dislocations which are to penetrate the void.\n\nlast section that the upper part of the void is dominant\nin pinning of edge dislocations because of the hydrostatic\npressure. In the case (b), we test N = 2 and cannot find\nany difference from the non-deformed case regarding the\ncritical angle. Thus, as far as the vacancy absorption\nmechanism (i.e. climb) is absent, the pinning strength is\nnot seriously altered by the passage of dislocations.\nVII.\n\nDISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUDING\nREMARKS\nA.\n\npractical applications\n\nLet us estimate the yield stress of copper in which voids\nare randomly distributed. First, we determine the average spacing L between obstacles on a glide plane. The\nareal density is represented as 2r\u03c1, where \u03c1 denotes the\nnumber density of voids per unit volume. Then the\n\u221a average spacing on a glide plane is written as L = 1/ 2r\u03c1.\nSince the expression includes all voids which intersects a\nglide plane, their impact parameters are randomly distributed from \u2212r to r. Since we have seen that the pinning strength \u03b1 considerably changes with the impact\nparameter d in the section V, we wish to incorporate this\nresult. However, there is no simulation which considers\nthis effect at this point. Therefore, we have to resort a\nrough approximation here.\nFrom FIG. 11, strong pinning (\u03b1 \u2265 0.4) occurs only\nwhere \u22121.2r \u2264 d \u2264 0.2r. We neglect the rest. Namely,\nit is assumed that only this region is responsible for\npinning.\n\u221a We use 1.4r instead of the diameter 2r; then\nL \u2243 1/ 1.4r\u03c1. We can rewrite Eq. (2) as\n\u03c4c =\n\n1.8\u03b3\u03b1 p\n1.4r\u03c1,\nb\n\n(13)\n\nwhere the line tension \u03b3 should be interpreted as the effective one that is determined by the present simulation,\nFIG. 9.\n\n\f8\nFor example, an irradiated copper specimen includes\nvoids whose average diameter 2r = 4.1 nm, and the number density \u03c1 is 2.9 \u00d7 1022 m\u22123 [21]. From the present\nsimulation, the line tension \u03b3 and the pinning strength\n\u03b1 are estimated as 0.42 nN and 0.9, respectively. The\neffective areal density is then calculated as 8.4 \u00d7 10\u22125\nnm\u22122 (i.e. the average spacing is 110 nm). This yields\n\u03c4c = 40 MPa, which is quite a reasonable value. In order\nto give more precise predictions, Eq. (2) should be modified to include the effects of the impact parameter and\nthe orientation dependent line tension.\nB.\n\ncomparison with a continuous model with\nself-interaction\n\nScattergood et al. have presented the calculation on\nthe dislocation pinning by a void based on the framework of Bacon et al. [16]. It is a continuous model that\nincorporates the self-interaction of a dislocation. Since\ntheir system also consists of the periodic array of voids,\nwe wish to compare their result to ours.\nLet us briefly review their discussion. They have speculated that depinning concerns the line tension near the\npinning point, where a dislocation forms a dipole. Since\na dislocation rotates by almost \u03c0/2 there, we regard the\neffective line tension as that of its counterpart. For example, as for an edge dislocation, the effective line tension\nupon depinning is that of a screw dislocation. Then the\ndepinning stress for an edge dislocation is expressed by\n2\u03b3eff\nLb\nGb2\nlog R\u0304,\n\u03b3eff =\n4\u03c0\n1\nB\nB\n+ ,\n=\nL \u2212 2r 2r\nR\u0304\n\u03c4 =\n\n(14)\n(15)\n(16)\n\nwhere R\u0304 should be interpreted as the effective outer cutoff\ndivided by the core cutoff. Note that B itself is not the\ncore cutoff but an unknown function of the core cutoff.\nThe above equations yield Eq. (6).\nTheir discussion can be extended to dislocations of arbitrary orientation.\n\u03b3eff =\n\nh\ni\nGb2\n\u03c0\n1 \u2212 \u03bd cos2 ( \u2212 \u03b8) log R\u0304,\n4\u03c0(1 \u2212 \u03bd)\n2\n\n(17)\n\nwhere \u03bd and \u03b8 denote Poisson's ratio and the angle between the dislocation line and the Burgers vector, respectively. In the present case, substituting \u03b8 = \u03c0/3 (for the\npartials) into Eq. (17) yields \u03c4 = 30 log R\u0304 [MPa]. Recall\nthat Eq. (17) is an expression for the resolved shear stress\nwith respect to the Burgers vector of a partial dislocation. It is equivalent to \u03c4 = 35 log R\u0304 [MPa] with respect\nto the Burgers vector of an original perfect dislocation.\nIndeed, it shows an excellent agreement with the critical\nstress of the trailing partial.\n\nHowever, the problem is the arbitrary parameter B.\nThis arbitrariness may vanish if we can calculate the\ndeformed (curved) effect on the dislocation energy, although it is a very complicated problem. At least, we\nconfirm that the extended form of the proportional constant Eq. (17) agrees with the present simulation, if there\nis no strong interaction between the partials.\n\nC.\n\nconclusion\n\nWe calculated the critical stress and the critical pinning angle for the interaction between an edge dislocation\nand a void in fcc copper. Dissociation of a dislocation\nplays an important role in the behaviors of the critical\nstress: i) It is much lower than the estimation of Scattergood and Bacon, which does not consider dissociation. ii)\nIt suddenly increases at a certain void radius where two\npartials can be simultaneously trapped. iii) The depinning stress of the trailing partial does agree with that of\nScattergood and Bacon, since the leading partial moves\nfar from the void.\nWe also found that there is no temperature dependence\nin the critical stress and the pinning angle. This is opposite to the previous simulation on bcc iron [7, 8, 9].\nThe difference comes from the presence (in bcc) or the\nabsence (in fcc) of climb motion.\nThe pinning strength cos(\u03c6c /2) obeys the empirical\nlogarithmic law which has been found in [15, 16]. The\ndistance between the void center and the glide plane (the\nimpact parameter) is found to affect the pinning strength\nin asymmetric manner. This is due to the hydrostatic\npressure around an edge dislocation. Hence, it is interesting to compare the result with that of a screw dislocation, which is a work in progress.\nThe impact parameter dependence of the critical angle also suggests the importance of randomness in the\npinning strength. Even if the system contains voids of\nthe same radius, the cross section on a glide plane is\nrandomly distributed. Hence we have to incorporate the\nrandomness in the pinning strength. It is not straightforward to deduce this effect from the existing simulations\nwhich treats only two kinds of obstacles [22]. Investigation of a continuous model with random pinning angles\nwill be interesting to see how the impact parameter dependence affects the macroscopic dislocation motion.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge Nobuyasu Nita\nfor useful discussions regarding experimental situations.\nThey also thank Yuhki Satoh and Hideo Kaburaki for\ndiscussions and valuable comments.\n\n\f9\n\n[1] A.
