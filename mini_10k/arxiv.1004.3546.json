Exploratory observations with the X-shooter spectrograph on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) of the European Southern Observatory (ESO)\nshow the system CSWA 5 to consist of at least three images of a blue star-forming galaxy\nat z = 1.0686, lensed by an apparent foreground group of red galaxies one of which is at\nz = 0.3877. The lensed galaxy exhibits a rich spectrum with broad interstellar absorption\nlines and a wealth of nebular emission lines. Preliminary analysis of these features shows the\ngalaxy to be young, with an age of \u223c 25\u201350 Myr. With a star-formation rate of \u223c 20 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ,\nthe galaxy has already assembled a stellar mass M\u2217 \u223c 3 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 and reached half-solar\nmetallicity. Its blue spectral energy distribution and Balmer line ratios suggest negligible internal dust extinction. A more in-depth analysis of the properties of this system is currently\nhampered by the lack of a viable lensing model. However, it is already clear that CSWA 5\nshares many of its physical characteristics with the general population of UV-selected galaxies at redshifts z = 1\u20133, motivating further study of both the source and the foreground mass\nconcentration responsible for the gravitational lensing.\nKey words: gravitational lensing: strong \u2013 galaxies: abundances \u2013 galaxies: evolution.\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\nGalaxies at redshifts z >\n\u223c 1 are generally too faint for their restframe ultraviolet (UV) spectra to be recorded with the high resolution and signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios required for an in-depth\nstudy of their most important physical properties. Consequently,\nour knowledge of the high redshift galaxy population is still largely\nbased on analyses of stacked spectra which average together observations of many galaxies in order to improve the S/N ratio (e.g.\nShapley et al. 2003; Vanzella et al. 2009; Weiner et al. 2009). A\nfew exceptions are sources which, thanks to their fortuitous location behind foreground mass concentrations such as massive galaxies, or groups and clusters of galaxies, are strongly lensed so that\ntheir fluxes are significantly boosted.

These candidate gravitationally lensed systems are\nthen followed up with high spatial resolution images from the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST;\ne.g. Bolton et al. 2006; Willis et al. 2005). In a complementary approach, The CAmbridge Sloan Survey Of Wide ARcs in the skY\n(CASSOWARY) targets multiple, blue companions around massive\nellipticals in the SDSS photometric catalogue as likely candidates\nfor wide-separation gravitational lens systems (see Belokurov et al.\n2009).\nThese and other search strategies have led to numerous recent discoveries of strongly lensed galaxies at z >\n\u223c\n1 which have been followed up in detail over a range of\nwavelengths (see Lemoine-Busserolle et al. 2003; Cabanac et al.\n2005; Belokurov et al. 2007; Coppin et al. 2007; Swinbank et al.\n2007; Cabanac et al. 2008; Stark et al. 2008; Finkelstein et al.\n2009; Hainline et al. 2009; Quider et al. 2009; Siana et al. 2009;\nDessauges-Zavadsky et al. 2010; Quider et al. 2010, and references\ntherein). However, all of these studies have of necessity focused\nonly on limited wavelength intervals, mostly in the rest-frame UV\n(redshifted to optical wavelengths) or the rest frame optical (redshifted into the near-infrared). It is only with the recent advent of\nthe X-shooter spectrograph on the Very Large Telescope (VLT)\nfacility of the European Southern Observatory (ESO), that both\n\nwavelength ranges can now be recorded at once with good sensitivity. The obvious advantages have been demonstrated in our recent\nstudy of CASSOWARY 20 (CSWA 20, Pettini et al. 2010), a blue\nstar-forming galaxy at zem = 1.433 lensed into a wide separation\n(\u223c 6 arcsec) Einstein Cross by a massive luminous red galaxy at\nzabs = 0.741 with velocity dispersion \u03c3lens \u2243 500 km s\u22121 .\nThe current CASSOWARY catalogue2 includes seven spectroscopically confirmed lensed galaxies at z > 1. In this paper we\nconfirm an eighth case with X-shooter observations of CSWA 5.\nAs can be seen from Figure 1, this multiple system consists of two\nforeground red galaxies one of which (L2) has an SDSS spectrum\nwhich shows it to be at zabs = 0.3877, and four fainter sources,\nseparated by \u223c 1\u20135 arcsec. Three of these images, im1, im2 and\nim3, are shown by the observations reported here to be gravitationally lensed images of an emission line galaxy at zem = 1.0686,\nwhile the fourth image, not covered by our observations, remains\nto be confirmed spectroscopically. Coordinates and magnitudes of\nthe different components of CSWA 5 are given in Table 1. However,\nwe caution that the SDSS pipeline magnitudes, which are based on\nexponential profile fits, are likely to be significantly more uncertain\nthan formal errors quoted, because of blending between the differ2\n\nhttp://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/research/cassowary/\n\n\fX-shooter Observations of CSWA 5\n\n3\n\nFigure 2.

In particular, while image\nim1 may appear to be bluer than im2 from the magnitudes listed in\nTable 1, we suspect that this is just due to blending with the foreground red galaxy L1, because our X-shooter spectra of all three\nimages, im1, im2, and im3, exhibit the same continuum slope.\nThis paper is organised as follows. We describe the X-shooter\nobservations in Section 2 and consider the lensing galaxies in Section 3. The main focus of the paper is the rich absorption and emission line spectrum of the source, described in Sections 4 and 5 respectively. We discuss our main results in Section 6 and conclude in\nSection 7. Unless otherwise stated, we assume a flat cosmological\nmodel with H0 = 73 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 and \u03a9\u039b = 0.72 (Spergel et al.\n2007).\n\n2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION\nThe first of the second generation VLT instruments, X-shooter\n(D'Odorico et al. 2006) is a three arm, single object echelle spectrograph which was successfully integrated into standard VLT operation on October 1, 2009. The instrument covers simultaneously the wavelength range from 300 nm to 2400 nm at resolving powers R = \u03bb/\u2206\u03bb = 5100, 8800 and 5600 in the UV-B\n(\u2206\u03bb = 300\u2013550 nm), VIS-R (\u2206\u03bb = 550\u20131015 nm), and NIR arms\n(\u2206\u03bb = 1025\u20132400 nm) respectively. The corresponding slit widths\nare 1.0, 0.9, and 0.9 arcsec respectively. Although X-shooter is optimised for observations of single targets with a 11 arcsec long slit,\nit also allows for simultaneous recording of close pairs of objects\non the sky. As a test of the performance of the spectrograph, two\nCASSOWARY candidates were observed during the commissioning run of the instrument in March 2009. Results on the first object,\nCSWA 20, have recently been published by Pettini et al. (2010).\nThis second paper reports the observations of CSWA 5.\nReferring to Figure 1, the entrance slit of X-shooter was rotated to a position angle on the sky of P.A. = 8 degrees and aligned\nso as to capture the light of images im1 and im2; at this PA, part\nof the light from image im3 also falls into the slit. The UV-B and\nVIS-R detectors were binned by a factor of two in the spectral direction. The total exposure time on source was 2400 s, split into\ntwo 1200 s long integrations; each integration on source was followed by a 1200 s exposure on a nearby blank sky region. From\nthe r \u2032 -band acquisition frame reproduced in Figure 1, we measured\n\na seeing full width at half maximum FWHM = 0.\u2032\u2032 9. The seeing\nimproved during the course of the observations; from the spatial\nextent of the spectra themselves we measured FWHM = 0.\u2032\u2032 8 in the\nUV-B arm, 0.\u2032\u2032 7 in the VIS-R arm, and 0.\u2032\u2032 6 in the NIR arm. With\nthe chosen setup, the slit losses in the three arms are estimated to\nbe 15\u201310%.\nThe spectra were reduced with a preliminary version of the\nESO X-shooter pipeline (Goldoni et al. 2006), which uses subtraction of the sky lines based on the procedures developed by Kelson\n(2003). For the UV-B and VIS-R data, we found it most advantageous to subtract the sky signal from the same two-dimensional\n(2D) frames on which the light from CSWA 5 was recorded, while\nfor the NIR data sky subtraction from the separate blank sky 2D\nframes worked best. The pipeline reduction used calibration spectra\ntaken during the commissioning run for order location and tracing,\nflat fielding and wavelength calibration. The final product from the\npipeline is an extracted 2D, wavelength calibrated, rectified spectrum with orders combined using a weighting scheme. For further\ndata processing and analysis we used standard IRAF tools. We produced 1D spectra using a 1.2 arcsec extraction aperture in all three\narms and for all three images of the source (see right panel of Figure 1). As discussed in Section 4, the 16 strongest emission lines\nwhich were clearly detected in all three spectra were measured to\nbe at the same redshift within \u2206z = 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 . Furthermore, we\nfound no significant differences in the emission line ratios nor in\nthe continuum slopes of the spectra of images im1, im2 and im3,\nleading us to conclude that all three images are lensed counterparts\nof the same background galaxy. Thus, unless otherwise specified,\nthe following analysis was performed on the sum of the spectra of\nim1, im2 and im3, so as to maximise the S/N ratio of the data.\nAbsolute flux calibration was performed with reference to the\nHST white dwarf standard GD 71, while the O8 V star Hipparcos\n69892 provided a reference smooth spectrum for dividing out telluric absorption. Both stars were observed the night prior to the observations of CSWA 5. Even though Hipparcos 69892 was observed\nat similar airmass as CSWA 5, the correction for atmospheric absorption is not perfect, especially in the regions of low transmission between the J, H, and K bands. A correction for atmospheric\nextinction was applied assuming a standard atmospheric extinction curve. Overall, we expect the absolute flux calibration of these\ncommissioning data to be accurate to within \u223c 20%, based on the\n\n\f4\n\nL. Christensen et al.\n\ncomparison between the spectrum and the SDSS magnitudes of im1\n(the least contaminated of the four images).\n\n3 FOREGROUND GALAXIES\nOur X-shooter observations described above did not include either\nof the (presumably) foreground red galaxies visible in Figure 1.\nGalaxy L2 has an SDSS spectrum reproduced in Figure 2. We identify a number of stellar absorption features, labelled in Figure 2,\nwhich indicate that it lies at redshift zabs = 0.3877. In order to\nobtain an estimate of the velocity dispersion (and hence the mass)\nof the galaxy, we used the the penalised pixel fitting method of\nCappellari & Emsellem (2004), taking into account the difference\nin velocity resolution between the input stellar template spectra of\nS\u00e1nchez-Bl\u00e1zquez et al. (2006) and the SDSS spectrum. The best\nfit gives a stellar velocity dispersion \u03c3L2 = 278 \u00b1 6 km s\u22121 ,\nwhere the uncertainty reflects the dispersion in the values of \u03c3\nobtained with different stellar templates. The corresponding mass\nis M (r) = \u03c0\u03c3 2 r/G (appropriate to an isothermal sphere), or\nML2 \u2243 6 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 , adopting r = 10 kpc .\nAt redshift z = 0.3877, the SDSS z filter is closest to restframe r. From the SDSS measured magnitude z(L2) = 17.67,\nwe deduce an absolute magnitude Mr (L2) = \u221223.17, given the\ndistance modulus m \u2212 M = 41.17 in our cosmology and applying an evolutionary correction of 0.85z to Mr , as proposed by\nBernardi et al. (2006). There is no SDSS spectrum for galaxy L1. If\nit is at the same redshift as L2, z = 0.3877, its absolute magnitude\nis Mr (L1) = \u221222.82 and the projected separation between the two\ngalaxies is 28 kpc. The absolute magnitude and velocity dispersion\nof L2 are within the range of values found by Bernardi et al. (2006)\nin their sample of massive early-type galaxies selected from the\nSDSS database.\n3.1 Lens Model\nFor the interpretation of many of the properties of the source, it\nwould be advantageous to obtain estimates of the magnification\nfactors which apply to images im1\u2013im3. To this end, we attempted\na simple modelling of the CSWA 5 system following the approach\ndescribed in Pettini et al. (2010), but quickly realised that we have\ninsufficient data at our disposal for even the simplest characterization of the lens. For the idealised case of an isolated singular\nisothermal sphere, the typical deflection is given by:\n\u0010\n\u00112 \u0012 D \u0013\n\u03c3\nds\n\u2206\u03b8 = 1.\u2032\u2032 15\n(1)\nDs\n200 km s\u22121\nwhere Dds is the angular diameter distance between deflector and\nsource, whilst Ds is the distance between observer and source. If\ngalaxy L1 is: (a) the lens, and (b) at the same redshift as L2, then\napplying the measured \u03c3L2 = 278 km s\u22121 (which would actually\nbe an upper limit for L1, since L1 is fainter than L2-see Table 1)\nto eq. (1) would result in typical deflections of \u223c 1.4 arcsec, or\nonly about half the deflections of images im1\u2013im4. We are thus led\nto one of two conclusions. Either L1 is substantially more massive\nthan L2, as would be case if it is at a higher redshift, or L2 and\nother galaxies in the group significantly boost the lensing by L1.\nPresumably the second option is the more likely, given the proximity of L1 and L2 on the sky and their broadly similar magnitudes\nand colours (Table 1).\nLensing by binary galaxies has been studied by Shin & Evans\n(2008). From these authors' work, we find that three image mor-\n\nFigure 3. Profiles of the [O II ] \u03bb\u03bb3728, 3730 (upper panel) and\n[O III ] \u03bb5008 (lower panel) emission lines extracted separately from images im1, im2, and im 3. The spectra have been offset vertically, and scaled\nto facilitate comparison. The line profiles are indistinguishable within the\naccuracy of the data, indicating that the three images are lensed counterparts of the same background galaxy at zem = 1.06856.\n\nphologies qualitatively corresponding to im1, im2 and im3 can be\nobtained (see lower panel of their Figure 10). However, five image morphologies qualitatively corresponding to im1, im2, im3 and\nim4, together with a highly demagnified fifth or central image are\nalso possible (see middle panel of their Figure 11). Thus, in order to\nmake progress, it will be necessary to measure the redshifts of L1\nand other galaxies in the field, as well as to resolve the ambiguous\nstatus of im4. Without a satisfactory lensing model, any luminositydependent quantity derived for the source will be uncertain by an\namount corresponding to the unknown magnification factor.\n\n4 SOURCE GALAXY\nOur X-shooter observations show images im1, im2 and im3 of the\nCSWA 5 system to be gravitationally lensed images of a luminous\nstar-forming galaxy at z = 1.0686. This is illustrated in Figure 3,\nwhere the individual profiles of two of the best observed emission\nlines, the [O II] \u03bb\u03bb3728, 3730 doublet and the [O III] \u03bb5008 line\nare shown separately for images im1, im2 and im3.

Furthermore, when\nmeasured separately in each image, the redshifts of the 16 strongest\nemission lines agree to within \u2206z = 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 . On the basis of this\nevidence, we conclude that im1, im2 and im3 are gravitationally\nlensed images of the same galaxy.\nThe galaxy exhibits a rich absorption and emission line spectrum which we now describe in detail. Unless otherwise specified,\nthe measurements reported below refer to the sum of the three images, so as to maximise the S/N ratio.\n4.1 Absorption Lines\nThe UV-B and VIS-R spectra of the source show many strong absorption lines from neutral and singly ionised species formed in the\ninterstellar medium of the lensed galaxy. They are listed in Table 2,\nand a few examples are reproduced in Figure 4. They define a mean\nabsorption redshift zabs = 1.0685\u00b10.0002, where the error quoted\nis the standard deviation from the mean. The absorption lines detected are wide, spanning a velocity range of up to \u223c 400 km s\u22121 .\nWith the relatively short exposure time devoted to CSWA 5\nduring the X-shooter commissioning, the signal-to-noise ratio of\nthe spectra is low in the continuum, S/N \u2243 5. Thus, only the\n\nstrongest interstellar absorption lines could be detected with confidence. Such lines are saturated and unsuitable for column density\ndetermination. Under these circumstances, application of the apparent optical depth method of Savage & Sembach (1991) yields lower\nlimits to the column densities N . Out of the transitions listed in Table 2, only two, Si II \u03bb1898 and Fe II \u03bb2374, may be sufficiently\nweak to provide estimates of N (Si II) and N (Fe II) respectively.\nTaken at face value, the column densities of these two ions may\nindicate a depletion of Fe by a factor of \u223c 5, since Si and Fe have\ncomparable relative abundances in the Sun (Asplund et al. 2009),\nwhereas N (Fe II) \u2243 1/5N (Si II) in CSWA 5.\n\n4.2 Emission Lines\nThanks to its wide wavelength coverage, the X-shooter spectrum\nof CSWA 5 includes a multitude of nebular emission lines, from\nHe I \u03bb10833 to the C III] \u03bb\u03bb1907, 1909 doublet; a selection is reproduced in Figure 5. As can be seen from Table 3, we detect\n11 members of the Balmer series, as well as Pa\u03b4, and several\ntransitions of He, C, N O, Ne, S and Ar in a variety of ionisation stages. The emission lines define a mean redshift zem =\n1.06856 \u00b1 0.00004 (1\u03c3), weighted by the flux in each line.\nThe strongest emission lines are best fit with a combination of two Gaussian functions; a narrow component centred at\nz1 = 1.06859 with a velocity dispersion \u03c31 = 50 \u00b1 4 km s\u22121\n(after correction for the instrumental resolution) and a second,\nbroader component centred at the lower redshift z2 = 1.06843\nwith \u03c32 = 120 \u00b1 10 km s\u22121 . The uncertainties reflect the spread\nof values from acceptable fits to the line profiles. The redshift difference corresponds to a velocity separation \u2206v = 23 km s\u22121 . The\ntop left-hand panel in Figure 5 illustrates the profile decomposition for the [O II] \u03bb\u03bb3728, 3730 doublet. The flux ratio between the\nnarrow and broad component varies between 1.5:1 and 2:1 among\ndifferent emission lines. The two emission components are not easily distinguishable in the weaker, noisier lines. Thus, in Table 3 we\nquote the integrated fluxes across the emission lines, which are independent of profile decomposition.\n\n\f6\n\nL. Christensen et al.\n\nFigure 5.

In the following,\nwe make the assumption that the gas is ionised by OB stars, with\nnegligible contributions from shocks and an active galactic nucleus\n(AGN; see Section 6.3).\nPhysical quantities that are deduced from the ratios of emission lines-such as reddening, gas temperature, density, and chemical composition, or from the relative spectral energy distribution-\nsuch as the age of the stellar population, are independent of the\nmagnification factor applicable to each of the three images covered\nby our observations. This is not the case, however, for quantities\nderived from line and continuum luminosities, such as the star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass (M\u2217 ). In placing these quantities on an absolute scale, we are hampered not only by the lack of\na lensing model (Section 3.1), but also but the unknown fraction of\nthe light from image im3 captured by the X-shooter slit (see Figure 1). To simplify matters, we used the spectrum of image im1\nalone, rather than the sum of im1, im2 and im3, in our estimates of\nthe star formation rate (Section 5.2) and stellar mass (Section 5.5).\nWe chose im1 because it is less affected by blending than the other\nimages (see Figure 1), and we include explicitly the unknown magnification factor 1/flens in our estimates of SFR and M\u2217 below.\nHowever, we suspect that flens may be of order unity (within a factor of 2\u20133) for a single image, as found by Pettini et al. (2010) for\nCSWA 20, which has a similar configuration to CSWA 5.\n\n5.1 Reddening\n\nThe observed ratios of Balmer line intensities can be compared\nwith theoretical expectations from recombination theory to deduce\nthe amount of dust reddening. As is common practice in the analysis of H II regions, we assumed Case B recombination, an electron temperature Te = 104 K, and electron densities in the range\nn(e) = 102 \u2013104 cm\u22123 (Osterbrock 1989). We did not include\nH\u03b1 in the analysis because at z = 1.06856 it is redshifted to\n\u03bbobs = 13 579 \u00c5, between the infrared J and H bands, where\natmospheric absorption is very severe and difficult to correct for\naccurately (which presumably explains why the observed ratio\nH\u03b1/H\u03b2 in Table 3 is \u223c 25% lower than the value H\u03b1/H\u03b2 = 2.86\nexpected for Case B recombination). From the observed H\u03b2/H\u03b3 ratio, we deduce E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.10 \u00b1 0.03, while the H\u03b2/H\u03b4 ratio\ngives E(B \u2212 V ) = \u22120.09 \u00b1 0.05. The higher order Balmer lines\nhave larger relative line flux uncertainties, so the reddening derived\nfrom higher order ratios is less certain. The weighted average is\nE(B \u2212 V ) = 0.03 \u00b1 0.02. Thus, the H II regions of CSWA 5 (or\nat least the unobscured portions we see) suffer little dust reddening. Since the extinction is low (AV \u2243 0.1 mag, taking the usual\nratio of total to selective extinction RV \u2261 AV /E(B \u2212 V ) \u2243 4,\nCalzetti et al. 2000) and consistent with zero within the uncertainties, we did not include it in the analysis described in the following\nsubsections.\n\n\fX-shooter Observations of CSWA 5\nTable 3.

The errors\nquoted reflect only the random uncertainties from the counting statistics\nand do not include systematic sources of error resulting from correction\nfor atmospheric absorption, subtraction of sky emission lines, and\nabsolute flux calibration. For some emission lines (e.g. H\u03b1), the\nsystematic errors can be much larger than the random errors.\n\n5.2 Star Formation Rate\nWe can obtain estimates of the star formation rate from the luminosities in the H\u03b1 emission line and the near-UV continuum, using\nthe calibrations of these measures by Kennicutt (1998). Using the\nH\u03b2 flux measured for im1, F (H\u03b2) = 3.1 \u00d7 10\u221216 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 ,\nand the unreddened Case B recombination ratio F (H\u03b1)/F (H\u03b2) =\n2.86, we deduce F (H\u03b1) = 8.9 \u00d7 10\u221216 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 and a luminosity L(H\u03b1) = 5.1 \u00d7 1042 erg s\u22121 . This in turn implies:\nSFR = 7.9 \u00d7 10\u221242 L(H\u03b1) \u00d7\n\n1\n1\n\u00d7\n\u2243 23(M\u2299 yr\u22121 ), (2)\n1.8\nflens\n\nusing the conversion between L(H\u03b1) and SFR proposed by\nKennicutt (1998). The two corrections factors account for: (i) the\nflattening of the initial mass function (IMF) below 1 M\u2299 (Chabrier\n2003) relative to the single power law of the Salpeter (1955) IMF\nassumed by Kennicutt (1998), and (ii) the unknown lensing magnification of image im1, flens , as discussed above.\nTurning to the UV continuum, we measure F = 6.1 \u00d7\n10\u221218 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 \u00c5\u22121 from our X-shooter spectrum of im1 at\nobserved wavelengths near 5800 \u00c5. The corresponding rest-frame\n\n7\n\nluminosity near 2800 \u00c5, L\u03bd (2800) = 1.9 \u00d7 1029 erg s\u22121 Hz\u22121 ,\nimplies:\nSFR = 1.4\u00d710\u221228 L\u03bd (2800)\u00d7\n\n1\n1\n\u00d7\n\u2243 15(M\u2299 yr\u22121 ), (3)\n1.8 flens\n\nwith the same correction factors as above. The two values of SFR\nare in reasonable agreement, given the systematic uncertainties affecting the two estimators, which sample different portions of the\nIMF (see Meurer et al. 2009).\n5.3 Electron Temperature and Density\nAt the S/N ratio of the present data, the auroral lines most\ncommonly used for the determination of the electron temperature, [O III] \u03bb4363, [N II] \u03bb5755, and [S III] \u03bb6312 are below\nthe detection limit. The 3\u03c3 upper limit F (4363) 6 0.3 \u00d7\n10\u221216 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 translates to an upper limit on the temperature Te 6 9900 K (Aller 1984). Turning to density sensitive line ratios, we resolve both the [O II] \u03bb\u03bb3728, 3730 and the\nC III] \u03bb\u03bb1907, 1909 doublets, while [S II] \u03bb\u03bb6716, 6731 falls between the J and the H bands, where the atmospheric transmission\nis a few percent only. We used the NEBULAR package in IRAF, incorporating the calculations by Shaw & Dufour (1995), to deduce\nn(e) = 315 \u00b1 15 cm\u22123 from the observed F (3726)/F (3728) ratio, assuming Te = 10 000 \u00b1 1000 K. Although less tightly constrained, the observed F (1907)/F (1909) ratio is consistent with\nthe electron density deduced from the higher S/N ratio [O II] doublet.\n5.4 Chemical Abundances\nWith many nebular lines detected, we can estimate the abundances\nof the C, N, O group using a variety of strong emission line diagnostics. Results are collected in Table 4.\nOxygen. Oxygen is the element most commonly used to characterise the overall degree of metal enrichment of H II regions\nand we thus consider it first. Among the many calibrations of the\noxygen abundance based on the ratios of strong emission lines\n(e.g. Kewley & Ellison 2008), the R23 method first proposed by\nPagel et al. (1979) is the one still most commonly applied, at least\nto low redshift galaxies. We used the calibration of the index\nR23 \u2261 [F (3728) + F (3730) + F (4960) + F (5008)]/F (H\u03b2)\nby Kobulnicky & Kewley (2004), appropriate to the lower branch\nof the double-valued R23 vs. O/H relation, to deduce 12 +\nlog (O/H)R23 = 8.28, or approximately 40% of the oxygen abundance in the Sun (Asplund et al. 2009) and in the Orion nebula\n(Esteban et al. 2004). The random error in the value of log (O/H)\nis small and negligible compared with the 0.2\u20130.3 dex systematic\nuncertainty in the calibration of the R23 index (Kewley & Ellison\n2008). The lower branch solution is favoured by the low value of\nthe N abundance deduced below.\nThe calibrations of the oxygen abundance based on the ratios\nof nitrogen, oxygen and Balmer lines proposed by Pettini & Pagel\n(2004) have the advantages, compared to R23, of being singlevalued and relatively robust to errors in flux calibration and\ndust extinction. However, in the case of CSWA 5, their use is\npossibly compromised by the awkward redshifted wavelengths\nof H\u03b1 and the [N II] \u03bb\u03bb6550, 6585 doublet which fall between\nthe J and H bands, as already explained. We deduce 12 +\nlog (O/H)N2 = 8.47 \u00b1 0.07 from consideration of the ratio\nN 2 \u2261 log[F (6585)/F (H\u03b1)], and 12 + log (O/H)O3N2 =\n\n\f8\n\nL. Christensen et al.\n\nFigure 6. X-shooter spectrum of image im1 in CSWA 5, colour-coded to show the spectral ranges covered by the three arms of the spectrograph, as follows:\nblue is UV-B, green is VIS-R, and red is NIR. The spectrum has been smoothed with a boxcar filter of width 2.5 \u00c5. Overplotted in black is the bestfitting template spectrum computed with a Bruzual & Charlot (2003) model for a 40 Myr-old continuous star formation episode and assembled stellar mass\nM\u2217 = 2.8 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 .\n\nTable 4. C, N, O Abundances in CSWA 5.\n12 + log (O/H)\n8.3\u20138.5\n\nlog (N/O)\n\u22121.0 \u00b1 0.1\n\nlog (C/O)\n\u22120.6 \u00b1 0.2\n\n8.29 \u00b1 0.04 from the ratio O3N 2 \u2261 log[F (5008)/F (H\u03b2)] \u2212\nlog[F (6585)/F (H\u03b1)], using in both cases the calibrations of these\nindices deduced by Pettini & Pagel (2004). Again, the random errors quoted are small compared to the 0.2\u20130.3 dex systematic uncertainties of the calibrations. We conclude that the oxygen abundance in the lensed galaxy in CSWA 5 is 12 + log (O/H) = 8.3\u2013\n8.5, or (O/H)CSWA 5 \u2243 0.4\u20130.65 (O/H)\u2299 .\nNitrogen. In the absence of temperature-sensitive auroral lines,\nwe make use of the method developed by Thurston et al. (1996)\nto deduce the relative abundances of N and O. These authors used\nphotoionization models to deduce a relationship between the [N II]\ntemperature and the R23 index; in our case, t[N II] = 11 000 \u00b1\n\n1000 K. Once the [N II] temperature is known, the N/O ratio can\nbe deduced directly from the ratio of the [N II] \u03bb\u03bb6550, 6585\nand [O II] \u03bb\u03bb3728, 3730 doublets (Pagel et al. 1992), under the assumption that N+ /O+ \u2243 N/O which Thurston et al. (1996) argue\nintroduces only a small error. Following this procedure, we find\nlog (N/O)CSWA 5 = \u22120.95 \u00b1 0.10 or \u223c 80% of the solar value\nlog (N/O)\u2299 = \u22120.86 (Asplund et al. 2009). A slightly subsolar\nN/O ratio when the abundance of oxygen is \u223c 0.5 solar is in line\nwith the large body of such measurements now available in galaxies\nat a range of redshifts (e.g. Izotov et al. 2006; Pettini et al. 2008).\nCarbon. In the low density limit, the ratio C+2 /O+2 can be\ndeduced from the measured fluxes of the C III] \u03bb\u03bb1907, 1909\nand [O III] \u03bb\u03bb4960, 5008 doublets and a knowledge of the relevant collision strengths. Using the line emissivities given by\nAller (1984), we deduce log(C+2 /O+2 ) = \u22120.6 \u00b1 0.2, for\nTe = 10 000 \u00b1 1000 K. The ionization correction factor to deduce\nC/O from C+2 /O+2 is expected to be small (Garnett et al. 1995),\nand therefore we find (C/O)CSWA 5 \u2243 0.3\u20130.7(C/O)\u2299 , where\nlog(C/O)\u2299 = \u22120.26 (Asplund et al. 2009). As for nitrogen, the\n\n\fX-shooter Observations of CSWA 5\nsub-solar C/O ratio in CSWA 5 conforms to the established behaviour of C/O vs. O/H in metal-poor H II regions (Garnett et al.\n1995, 1999), Galactic stars (Akerman et al. 2004; Fabbian et al.\n2009), and Lyman break galaxies (Shapley et al. 2003; Erb et al.\n2010).\n\n5.5 Age and Assembled Stellar Mass\nFinally, we can obtain estimates of the age and stellar mass of the\nlensed galaxy by comparing its observed spectral energy distribution (SED), from the rest frame UV to the near-IR (from \u223c 2000 \u00c5\nto \u223c 1.2\u03bcm where our X-shooter spectrum has the highest S/N ratio), to those of synthetic spectra computed with simple stellar population models (e.g. Erb et al. 2006b). For this purpose, we used\nthe population synthesis code of Bruzual & Charlot (2003) with\nChabrier (2003) IMF, metallicity Z = 0.4Z\u2299 (Section 5.4), and\nno internal reddening (Section 5.1). We generated two families of\nmodels with these parameters, for the two limiting cases of continuous star formation and an instantaneous burst, in each case varying\nthe age from 1 to 70 Myr. The best fitting models and the corresponding values of age and assembled stellar mass were determined\nby minimizing the value of \u03c72 , given by:\n\u03c72 =\n\nX (fobs,\u03bb \u2212 b \u00d7 fmodel,\u03bb )2\n\u03bb\n\n2\n\u03c3obs,\u03bb\n\n(4)\n\nwhere fobs,\u03bb and \u03c3obs,\u03bb are the observed flux at wavelength\n\u03bb and its error respectively, and fmodel,\u03bb is the flux of the\nBruzual & Charlot (2003) model spectrum at the same wavelength.\nThe normalization factor b gives the stellar mass of the galaxy.\nIn fitting the model spectra to the X-shooter spectrum of image\nim1, we excluded regions affected by strong telluric absorption or\nby prominent residuals in the subtraction of sky emission lines. We\nfound that the best fitting models (see Figure 6) are those with ages\nof 40 \u00b1 10 Myr and stellar masses M\u2217 = (2.8 \u00b1 1.0) \u00d7 109 \u00d7\n1/flens M\u2299 , where flens is the unknown magnification factor of\nim1, and the error includes the 20% uncertainty in the absolute flux\ncalibration (Section 2).\nThese values appear to be robust to the choice of star formation mode, with the single burst and continuous star formation models converging to similar solutions. We also investigated the possibility that the stellar continuum suffers a greater extinction than\nthe H II emission lines, since the former could in principle sample a different (presumably older) stellar population than the latter.\nHowever, without recourse to the rest frame far-UV spectral range\n(which is inaccessible from the ground at z = 1.0686), we come\nup against the well-known age-extinction degeneracy. For example,\nmodels in which the stellar continuum is reddened with a colour excess E(B \u2212V ) = 0.3 also provide satisfactory fits to the X-shooter\nspectrum of CSWA 5, albeit with younger preferred ages of 25 \u00b1\n7 Myr and lower stellar masses of (2.3 \u00b1 0.7) \u00d7 109 \u00d7 1/flens M\u2299 .\nWe can obtain an independent estimate of the age of the starburst from consideration of the equivalent width of the H\u03b2 emission\nline, W0 (H\u03b2) \u2243 100 \u00c5, using the values of W0 (H\u03b2) as a function of time calculated with the S TARBURST 99 spectral synthesis\ncode (Leitherer et al. 2001). The equivalent widths of the Balmer\nrecombination lines fall rapidly following a burst of star formation\nand W0 (H\u03b2) < 100 \u00c5 for all ages greater than 5 Myr. On the other\nhand, the time dependence is less steep for continuous star formation and ages of \u223c 25 Myr are indicated, in better agreement the\nage inferred from the analysis of the UV to near-IR SED.\n\n9\n\n6 DISCUSSION\nSummarizing our findings, we have established that CSWA 5 is an\nactively star-forming galaxy at z = 1.0686 lensed by an apparent\nforeground group of massive red galaxies, at least one of which\nis at z = 0.3877. The lensed source is forming stars at a rate\nSFR \u2243 20 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , suffers negligible reddening, has an oxygen abundance of approximately half-solar, and sub-solar N/O and\nC/O ratios (as expected for low metallicity galaxies). Its blue spectral energy distribution, from the rest-frame UV to the near-IR, and\nhigh H\u03b2 equivalent width are indicative of a young age, only \u223c 25\u2013\n50 Myr, during which time the galaxy has assembled a stellar mass\nof \u223c 3 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 . The star-formation rate and stellar mass are uncertain by an unknown magnification factor, which may be of order\nunity for each of the four gravitationally lensed images of CWSA 5.\nThese physical characteristics are broadly in line with those of\nthe population of UV-selected galaxies at redshifts z = 1\u20133 (e.g.\nPettini et al. 2007, and references therein), as we now discuss.\n\n6.1 Mass-Metallicity Relation\nThe most relevant comparison here is with the mass-metallicity relation determined by Savaglio et al. (2005) for galaxies at a mean\nhzi \u2243 0.7 selected from the Gemini Deep Deep Survey (GDDS)\nand shown in Figure 7. It must be borne in mind here that such\ncomparisons are fraught with pitfalls for the unwary, because of\nsystematic differences between the methods used to determine both\nthe stellar mass and the metallicity. In this particular case, the study\nby Savaglio et al. (2005) should be compatible with ours, as both\nused a Chabrier (2003) IMF in arriving at the stellar masses and the\nR23 index for the oxygen abundance (although the reliability of\nthe latter at apparently super-solar metallicities is questionable-\nsee Pettini 2008).\nAn additional complication is the unknown magnification factor which applies to our derivation of the stellar mass. If flens in\nSection 5.5 is of order unity, then Figure 7 shows that CSWA 5\nis somewhat metal-poor for its stellar mass, compared to GDDS\ngalaxies at z \u223c 0.7. Definite conclusions are difficult at this stage,\ngiven the scatter of the GDDS galaxies about the mean relation in\nFigure 7, and the lack of objects as metal-poor as CSWA 5 in the\nsample considered by Savaglio et al. (2005). Taken at face value,\nthe offset of CSWA 5 in Figure 7 is in the same sense as the more\ngeneral redshift evolution of the mass-metallicity relation proposed\nby Maiolino et al. (2008).\n\n6.2 Specific Star Formation Rate\nSince the lens magnification factor enters into the calculation of\nboth SFR and M\u2217 , the ratio of these two quantities, commonly referred to as the specific star formation rate (SSFR), should not be\naffected. For CSWA 5 we deduce a specific SFR = (8.2 \u00b1 2.2) \u00d7\n10\u22129 yr\u22121 . The reciprocal of this value gives a timescale for the\nstar formation activity of \u223c 120 \u00b1 45 Myr, which is \u223c 3 times\nhigher than the age deduced in Section 5.5 from SED fitting.\nIn Figure 8 we compare the value of SSFR in CSWA 5 with\nthose of UV-selected galaxies at z \u2243 2 from the work by Erb et al.\n(2006b) and of lower redshift galaxies from the VVDS survey by\nLamareille et al. (2009). Clearly, CSWA 5 is more akin to the former than to the latter in its relatively high SSFR and correspondingly short star formation timescale.\n\n\f10\n\nL. Christensen et al.\n\nFigure 7. Mass metallicity relation for galaxies at z \u223c 0.7 from the GDDS\n(crosses; Savaglio et al. 2005). The location of CSWA 5 is indicated by the\nlarge filled circle. The errors shown do not include the systematic uncertainties in the metallicity and mass determinations.\n\n6.3 Emission line ratios\nFigure 9 shows that CSWA 5 is well separated from the locus of SDSS galaxies in the ionization diagnostic diagram of\nBaldwin et al. (1981), sometimes referred to as the BPT diagram.\nWhile we find no evidence for the presence of an AGN in CSWA 5\nfrom the width of the emission lines, we note that such offsets now\nappear to be common for the most actively star-forming galaxies (Erb et al. 2006a; Liu et al. 2008). Brinchmann et al. (2008)\npointed out that, among SDSS galaxies, there is a correlation between excess SSFR and offset from the main locus occupied by\n'normal' galaxies in the BPT diagram. Galaxies with higher SSFRs\ntend to exhibit higher values of the ratios [O III]/H\u03b2 and [N II]/H\u03b1.\nCSWA 5 apparently fits this trend. The underlying physical explanation for the offset is not well established, but there are indications\nthat it may be related to a higher ionization parameter of the H II regions, which in turn is presumably linked to the high star formation\nactivity (Liu et al. 2008; Brinchmann et al. 2008).\n\n7 CONCLUSIONS\nIt is encouraging and satisfying that through dedicated searches of\nlarge area surveys the number of gravitationally lensed galaxies at\nhigh redshifts continues to increase. The work presented here has\nnot only identified a new such example in the CASSOWARY catalogue but, more importantly, has demonstrated the wealth of information on the physical conditions of these objects which can be\ngleaned from even relatively short exposures with the X-shooter\nspectrograph, thanks to its high efficiency and wide wavelength\ncoverage. The main impediment we have found to the full characterization of CSWA 5 is the lack of a lensing model which can\nreproduce the deflections of the images. Higher spatial resolution\nimaging of the field (achievable with the Hubble Space Telescope)\nand more redshift determinations of galaxies in the field are needed\nfor a comprehensive census of the mass distribution along the line\nof sight and an accurate estimate of the magnification of CSWA 5.\nSuch information, combined with higher S/N ratio spectra of the\nfour lensed images (the work presented in this paper is based on\n\nFigure 8. Specific star-formation rate of CSWA 5 (large black dot) compared with those of galaxies at z > 2 (grey dots; Erb et al. 2006b), and\ngalaxies at 0 < z < 0.6 from the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey (VVDS)\n(small dots; Lamareille et al. 2009). All SFRs were derived from the H\u03b1\nluminosities. Lines of constant SFR are indicated by the straight solid and\ndashed lines. The mass (but not the specific SFR) of CSWA 5 is uncertain\nby an unknown factor 1/flens which may be of order unity. The scale on\nthe right vertical axis shows the formation time scale (the inverse of the\nspecific SFR).\n\nonly 40 minutes of integration on target), would lead to a full mapping of the properties of this star-forming galaxy.\nAs a final note, we should like to stress that the use of gravitational lensing to access the properties of galaxies at high redshifts\nis in some way still in its infancy. While the few cases studied so\nfar have been very successful in providing detailed views of these\nsystems which would otherwise have simply been unobtainable, it\nis also the case that nearly all of them appear to be drawn from the\nbright end of the galaxy luminosity function. Fainter galaxies are\naccessible with 8\u201310 m telescopes equipped with modern spectrographs, but are often overlooked in searches for strong gravitational\nlenses. By systematically extending such searches to fainter limits\nwith current and future (e.g. with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope) surveys, it will be possible to identify intrinsically fainter\ngalaxies, particularly at epochs when the Universe was forming\nmost of its stars, and thereby assemble a full picture of the galaxy\nformation process in action.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe good quality of the spectra obtained during the commissioning\nruns of the instrument was the result of the dedicated and successful\nefforts by the entire X-shooter Consortium team.
