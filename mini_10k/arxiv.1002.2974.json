The\nphoton spectrum is compatible with a power law dN/dE \u221d E \u2212\u0393 with an index\n\u0393 = 2.61 \u00b1 0.24stat \u00b1 0.2sys . The data are consistent with a point-like source.\nWe provide a detailed description of the analysis results, and discuss physical\nmechanisms that may be responsible for the observed \u03b3-ray emission.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nCassiopeia A is the youngest of the historical galactic supernova remnants (SNR); it\nfirst appeared in the sky about 1680 (Ashworth 1980; Stephenson & Green 2002). The\nbest estimate of the actual Cassiopeia A SN explosion date is AD 1680.5\u00b118.7, which was\ndeduced from the HST (Hubble Space Telescope) measurements of the expansion of ejecta\nknots (Fesen et al. 2006). It is also the brightest and one of the best studied radio sources\nin the sky (e.g, Kassim et al. (1995)). Located 3.4 kpc away (Reed et al. 1995), the optical\nshell of 2.5\u2032 radius corresponds to a physical size of about 2.5 pc. The synchrotron radiation\nof Cassiopeia A extends from radio wavelengths through the sub-millimeter (Mezger et al.\n1986) and near-infrared (Tuffs et al. 1997) all the way to hard X-rays (Allen et al. 1997;\nFavata et al. 1997; Vink et al. 2001; Renaud et al. 2006). The nature of the hard X-ray\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nemission measured up to 100 keV still remains unclear (see Helder & Vink (2008)), albeit\nthe morphology of the non-thermal X-ray emission is dominated by faint, well-defined\nfilaments and knots (Hughes et al. 2000; Vink & Laming 2003), which are possibly sites\nof cosmic ray acceleration. These energetic hadronic cosmic rays (CR) can subsequently\nproduce \u03b3 rays in collisions with ambient gas via \u03c0 \u25e6 -decay (Drury et al. 1994).\nEGRET did not detect \u03b3-ray emission above 100 MeV from Cassiopeia A (Esposito et al.\n1996). Likewise, first attempts to detect TeV \u03b3-ray emission from the ground with the\n10 m Whipple telescope (Lessard et al. 1999) and with CAT (Goret et al. 1999) resulted\nonly in upper limits. With an exposure of 232 hours, accumulated during the summer\nmonths of 1997, 1998, and 1999, HEGRA detected TeV \u03b3-ray emission associated with\nCassiopeia A (Aharonian et al. 2001). A 5 \u03c3 detection of Cassiopeia A resulted in a flux\nestimate of (5.8 \u00b1 1.2stat \u00b1 1.2syst ) \u00d7 10\u221213 cm\u22122 s\u22121 above 1 TeV. The energy spectrum\nmeasured in a range from 1 to 10 TeV was consistent with a power law with a photon index\nof \u0393 = 2.5 \u00b1 0.4stat \u00b1 0.1syst . Recently MAGIC and VERITAS have made observations of\nCassiopeia A at a substantially lower energy threshold.\nCassiopeia A was observed with the 17 m MAGIC telescope between July 2006 and\nJanuary 2007 for a total exposure of 47 hours (Albert et al. 2007). The \u03b3-ray source was\ndetected above 250 GeV at the level of statistical significance of 5.2 \u03c3, with a photon flux\nabove 1 TeV of (7.3 \u00b1 0.7stat \u00b1 2.2syst) \u00d7 10\u221213 cm\u22122 s\u22121 . The photon spectrum is compatible\nwith a power law with an index \u0393 = 2.3 \u00b1 0.2stat \u00b1 0.2syst . The source is point-like for the\ngiven angular resolution of the telescope. The position of the MAGIC source is consistent\nwith the source position previously published by HEGRA. In addition, the energy spectrum\nmeasured by MAGIC agrees within statistical errors with that measured by HEGRA.\nHere we report on observations of Cassiopeia A with the VERITAS stereoscopic\narray of four imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes in Arizona. In this paper a short\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\ndescription of the experiment is followed by a summary of observational data and analysis\nresults. Finally a discussion of the physics implications of VERITAS data for existing\nmodels of TeV \u03b3-ray emission from Cassiopeia A is given.\n\n2.\n\nExperiment\n\nVERITAS (Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System) (Weekes et al.\n2002) is an array of four imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes located in southern\nArizona (31\u25e6 40\u2032 N, 110\u25e6 57\u2032 W) at an altitude of 1.3 km. The four VERITAS telescopes\nare almost identical in their technical parameters (Holder et al. 2006). The 12 m optical\nreflector of a VERITAS telescope is a tessellated structure consisting of 357 identical\nspherical mirror facets, which are hexagonal in shape. The arrangement of the mirror facets\nconstitutes a Davies-Cotton design (Davies & Cotton 1957), providing a total reflecting\narea of 110 m2 . The point-spread function of a VERITAS telescope has a FWHM of \u223c 4\u2032\non-axis (McCann, Hanna, & McCutcheon 2009). A high-resolution imaging camera placed\nat the focus of the reflector consists of 499 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) in a close-packed\nhexagonal arrangement and has a field of view of 3.5\u25e6 . Each camera PMT views a circle of\ndiameter 0.15\u25e6 on the sky. A set of light concentrators is mounted in front of the PMTs\nto increase the light-collection efficiency and block the off-axis light. The camera triggers\nif the signal in each of any three adjacent PMTs exceeds a discriminator threshold of\n50 mV, corresponding to approximately 4-5 photoelectrons. A coincidence of at least two\ncameras triggering within a time gate of 100 ns is required to read out an event. A 48 ns\n(24-samples) length of each PMT signal is digitized with custom-built 500 MegaSamples/s\nflash-ADC electronics. The nominal trigger rate of the four-telescope array was about\n230 Hz at zenith. The cameras are flat-fielded and calibrated using nightly measured\nlaser runs. The pedestal and pedestal variances (\u03c3), which provide a measure of the night\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nsky background noise level, were calculated during each data run using pedestal events,\ninjected at a 1 Hz frequency. The pedestal variances were used for computing the dynamic\npicture and boundary thresholds for consequent image cleaning. All PMTs with a signal\nexceeding the picture threshold (5\u03c3) were used in the image parametrization. PMTs with\na signal exceeding the boundary threshold (2.5\u03c3) but lying near the picture PMTs were\nalso selected. (e.g., see Holder et al. (2006)). To characterize the shape and orientation\nof calibrated images recorded by each telescope, the standard second-moment parameters\nwere calculated as described by Reynolds et al. (1993).\n\n3.\n\nSummary of Data\n\nCassiopeia A was observed with VERITAS for 22 hours between September and\nNovember of 2007. All observations were made with the full four-telescope array during\nmoonless nights. The data-analysis pipeline consists of two distinct phases. After the data\nare processed, the distributions from the raw data are accumulated as diagnostics of both\nthe instrument performance and the stability of the weather conditions. Each data run is\ninspected for rate, timing and tracking consistency, and either accepted or rejected based on\nthis first pass. Once this diagnostic pass is made, acceptable runs are further analyzed. All\ndata were taken in 20-minute runs using the so-called Wobble source-tracking mode, which\nis optimal for observations of a point-like source. In Wobble mode the source is positioned\nat a 0.5\u25e6 offset from the center of the field of view of the camera during observations, which\nallows for both on-source observations and simultaneous estimation of the background\ncontamination caused by charged cosmic rays. The number of background events in the\nsignal region was estimated using a number of regions distributed symmetrically with\nrespect to the center of the camera for each wobble offset. The offset directions towards\nNorth, South, East, or West, were consequently alternated on a run-by-run basis. A total\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nof 74 data runs were collected at zenith angles between 26\u25e6 and 39\u25e6 . The average zenith\nangles and the average event trigger rate were 31.5\u25e6 \u00b1 3.7\u25e6 and 232 \u00b1 12 Hz, respectively.\nPrior to applying analysis cuts, data were selected for adequate image quality, by requiring\na minimum integrated charge of all pixels in the image of 400 digital counts (approximately\n80 photo-electrons) and a maximum distance of the image's centroid from the center of\nthe field of view of 1.43\u25e6 . These cuts were a priori optimized using the Crab Nebula data\nsample. Each accepted event was also required to contain at least two images passing these\ncuts. The VERITAS experimental setup during Cassiopeia A observations included two\ntelescopes placed at a rather small separation of 35 m. Coincidence events including both\nof these telescopes have been removed from the analysis. During the summer of 2009, one\nof these telescopes was relocated in order to improve the sensitivity of the array.\n\n4.\n\nData Analysis\n\nThe imaging analysis of the VERITAS data is based on the reconstruction of the\nshower direction for each individual event (Konopelko et al. 1999; Hofmann et al. 1999;\nKrawczynski et al. 2006), and joint parametrization of the shape of the Cherenkov light\nflash from an individual shower using a multiple-telescope approach (Konopelko 1995;\nKrawczynski et al. 2006). All recorded events were subjected to the canonical directional\ncut on \u03b82 , where \u03b8 is the angular distance between the true source position on the sky and\nthe reconstructed one. Of the remaining events, the candidates for \u03b3-ray showers were\nselected using two simultaneously applied cuts on the parameters of image shape: MSW\n(mean scaled Width) and MSL (mean scaled Length). These three major analysis cuts were\noptimized using Crab Nebula observational data from the same epoch, chosen for the same\nzenith angle range as covered in observations of Cassiopeia A. The choice of optimal analysis\ncuts depends noticeably on the flux of the putative \u03b3-ray source. Therefore, we developed\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\ntwo sets of analysis cuts, appropriate for flux levels of 1 and 0.03 Crab (see Table 1)\nrespectively. Both sets of optimal analysis cuts yield comparable signal significances for the\nCrab Nebula as well as Cassiopeia A (Table 2).\nThe VERITAS array enables measurement of the arrival direction of every individual\nshower detected. All recorded events that have passed both the image quality cuts and\nspecific analysis cuts can be plotted in a two-dimensional sky map. Even after applying\nrather strict selection criteria such maps are dominated by the flux of the isotropic cosmic\nray background. A number of methods (background models) have been developed for\neffective removal of background (Berge et al. 2007). These models can effectively handle\nthe background issues of diverse observations, but the weaknesses or strengths of any\nparticular approach depend on the flux, angular morphology, and spectrum of a given \u03b3-ray\nsource. In this paper we used a method that is rather stable with respect to any systematic\nbackground inhomogeneity across the camera field of view, the so-called ring-background\nmodel. In this model, a ring (annulus) around the location of a putative \u03b3-ray source in\nthe camera focal plane provides an immediate background estimate. The canonical angular\nradius of the background ring is 0.5\u25e6 , whereas the angular area (solid angle) covered by the\nring is typically chosen to be larger than that of the circular source region by a factor of\n7-10. The excess map of the sky region around Cassiopeia A for the data set of 22 hours is\nshown in Figure 1. An evident excess due to \u03b3 rays at a 8.3 \u03c3 level of statistical significance\n(Li & Ma 1983) can be observed at the position of Cassiopeia A. This result has been\ncross-checked using a standard Wobble analysis.\n\n5.\n\nSource Localization\n\nThe energy-averaged angular resolution of the VERITAS array for an individual \u03b3-ray\nevent is approximately 4\u2032 to 6\u2032 (68% containment radius). This implies that a point-like\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n\u03b3-ray source detected by VERITAS appears as a spot of finite size in the expanded \u03b3-ray\nsky map. The centroid of this spot is taken as the coordinates of the putative \u03b3-ray emitter.\nAny error in the telescope pointing direction will deteriorate the exact measurement of\nthe \u03b3-ray source position. Note that the pointing accuracy of the telescopes is limited,\nby small misalignment of azimuth and altitude axes, and elastic deformations of the\ntelescope structure. These effects contribute to the mispointing of the array, which strongly\ndepends on the altitude and azimuth of observation. Most of the pointing uncertainties\ncan be substantially diminished by taking pointing calibration data on a monthly basis.\nEach telescope is pointed at a number of bright stars uniformly distributed on the sky.\nThe star is imaged by the telescope mirror onto a screen in front of the Cherenkov\ncamera, and the image is recorded by a CCD camera. The position of each spot is then\ncompared to the nominal center of the Cherenkov camera. These results contribute to a\nmulti-parameter pointing model in the telescope tracking software that corrects for the\nmeasured misalignment during observation. This procedure was extensively tested on a\nnumber of VHE \u03b3-ray point sources of known position. In addition, the residual mispointing\ncan be evaluated from a detailed comparison of the nominal position of the source evaluated\nfor the different wobble offsets, energy thresholds, telescope multiplicities, analysis cuts,\netc. During Cassiopeia A observations the systematic pointing error of the VERITAS array\nis \u223c 1.2\u2032 .\nThe measured position of the \u03b3-ray source is determined by a fit over a circular window\nof 0.5\u25e6 radius centered on Cassiopeia A using its known coordinates. The profile of the\n\u03b3-ray excess can be modeled by the two-dimensional Gaussian distribution:\n1 (\u03b8x \u2212 \u03b8xo )2 (\u03b8y \u2212 \u03b8y o )2\nf (\u03b8x , \u03b8y ) \u221d exp(\u2212 (\n+\n),\n2\n\u03c32 x\n\u03c32 y\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b8xo , \u03b8y o are the angular coordinates of the \u03b3-ray emission centroid, and \u03c3 2 x , \u03c3 2 y\nare the extensions of the signal region in two perpendicular directions. The width of the\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\ntwo-dimensional Gaussian fit is composed of the fixed angular resolution of the VERITAS\narray and the intrinsic size of the source. Note that the excess map generated by the\nring-background model has been smoothed using a circular window of 0.115\u25e6 radius, which\napproximately corresponds to the angular resolution of the VERITAS array. First, this\nmethod was tested on the 1ES 2344+514 data taken with the VERITAS telescope array\nduring the same observational season as that of Cassiopeia A with an instrument of similar\nconfiguration. 1ES 2344+514 is a blazar-type AGN, which was in a high state of \u03b3-ray\nemission during the Cassiopeia A observations. Given the redshift of 1ES 2344+514 of\nz = 0.044, it is indubitably a point source. In addition, the total number of recorded\n\u03b3 rays from 1ES 2344+514 was of the same order as the number of excess counts from\nCassiopeia A. Therefore, this object could be used as a calibration source for estimating the\nlimits of the source localization procedure. The width of the \u03b3-ray point-spread function\n(PSF) evaluated using 1ES 2344+514 data is \u03c3o = 4.8\u2032 . However, this observationally\ndetermined PSF is significantly affected by the angular size of the signal region used by the\nring-background model, which was adopted for the smoothing of the two-dimensional sky\nmaps. Alternatively, one can use the excess count sky map of uncorrelated bins which leads\nto similar results. The position of the 1ES 2344+514 \u03b3-ray peak derived from the best fit\nwas found to be consistent with the astronomical position of this object (RA (\u03b1): 23 h\n47 m 04.919 s, dec (\u03b4): +51o 42\u2032 17.87\u2032\u2032 ) within the statistical uncertainties of the best-fit\nposition on right ascension and declination, \u2206RA and \u2206dec , of 1.24\u2032 and 9\u2032\u2032 , respectively.\nThese results ultimately validate the accuracy of the analysis method. Cassiopeia A data\nwere analyzed using exactly the same two-dimensional analysis technique. The derived\nposition of the peak of \u03b3-ray emission from Cassiopeia A deviates from the nominal position\nof the supernova remnant (Becker, White, & Edwards 1991) (\u03b1 = 23 h 23 m 24 s, \u03b4 =\n+58 deg 48.9\u2032 ) by less than \u2206RA = 14\u2032\u2032 and \u2206dec = 35\u2032\u2032 . Evidently, the observed \u03b3-ray\nemission is associated with the Cassiopeia A SNR.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n6.\n\nSource Extension\n\nThe angular radius of Cassiopeia A, measured at wavelengths longer than those\ncorresponding to TeV energies, is about 2.5\u2032 . Primarily, this can be used as a characteristic\nangular size of the TeV \u03b3-ray source. It is apparent that such a small angular dimension\nof Cassiopeia A is well below the angular resolution (PSF) of VERITAS, \u03c3\u25e6 \u2243 4.8\u2032 , which\nunavoidably smears out the intrinsic source distribution and consequently does not permit\ndetailed mapping of the morphology of the \u03b3-ray source. The angular profile of the observed\n\u03b3-ray peak finally constrains the intrinsic angular size of the source. The two-dimensional,\nazimuthally symmetric Gaussian function could be naturally used to model the measured\nangular shape of the \u03b3-ray signal. The angular extent of the \u03b3-ray peak towards Cassiopeia\nA measured with VERITAS is \u03c3Cas A =5.3\u00b10.5\u2032 .\nThe angular extent of the point-spread function can be derived from the data taken on\na calibration \u03b3-ray source. For that we can use again the contemporaneous observations\nof 1ES 2344+514. The best fit of the \u03b3-ray peak for 1ES 2344+514 gives \u03c3 = 4.8\u00b10.2\u2032 .\nIf we assume a \u03b3-ray source with a Gaussian profile, an approximate upper limit on the\nsource extent can be calculated by summing the measured extents of the PSF and the\n2\n2 1/2\nCassiopeia A \u03b3-ray signal in quadrature, \u03c3s = (\u03c3Cas\n. 3.5\u2032 . Thus, given rather\nA \u2212\u03c3 )\n\nlarge statistical errors of the involved angular extents the shape of the Cassiopeia A signal\nis hardly distinguishable from the point-spread function and the \u03b3-ray signal is statistically\nconsistent with the point source.\nThe low statistics of currently recorded \u03b3 rays from Cassiopeia A are not sufficient\nto draw a final conclusion on the source extension. A further, deeper, observation of\nCassiopeia A with VERITAS might help to improve the measurement of the angular\nextension of the TeV \u03b3-ray source.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n7.\n\nEnergy Reconstruction\n\nStereoscopic observations of atmospheric showers with four VERITAS telescopes enable\naccurate localization of the shower axis in the ground plane. Thus the impact distances from\nthe shower axis to the system telescopes can be calculated in a straightforward manner. The\ngeneric reconstruction algorithm (Konopelko et al. 1999) is based on a simultaneous use\nof image orientation in several telescopes for each individual event. The accuracy of such\nreconstruction is limited by the uncertainties in the determination of the image orientation.\nBy observing \u03b3-ray showers at zenith angles less than 45\u25e6 and restricting the impact\ndistances to less than 250 m, the average accuracy in evaluation of the telescope impacts\nis better than 10 m. If the distance from the shower axis to the telescope (ri , i = 1, n,\nwhere n is the number of recorded images) is known, the primary energy of the air shower\ncan be evaluated using the inverse function of the image size with respect to the shower\nenergy Ei = F (Si , ri , \u03b8) (Konopelko et al. 1999). Here Si stands for the image size (the\ntotal number of photoelectrons in the image), ri is the impact distance, and \u03b8 is the zenith\nangle. This function can be well represented by a multi-variable look-up table, which\ncontains the mean energy for Monte Carlo simulations across the range of image sizes\nand impact distances of recorded \u03b3-ray showers. Such look-up tables were created for a\nnumber of zenith angles. Finally, the shower energy can be computed by averaging over all\nP\nreconstructed energies for individual telescopes Ei , i = 1, n, as Eo = i wi Ei , where wi is\nP\nthe statistical weight ( i wi = 1). Rather accurate and robust estimations can be achieved\nfor wi = 1/n. The energy resolution of the VERITAS array of four imaging air Cherenkov\ntelescopes averaged over the entire dynamic energy range is 15-20%. Note that the energy\nresolution is unavoidably limited by the fluctuations in image size for a given shower energy.\nIn order to control any possible systematic biases in the energy reconstruction, one\ncan use the error in the reconstructed energy, \u03b4E = (E \u2212 Eo )/Eo as a function of the true\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nenergy, Eo . Even though this error usually does not exceed a 5% level over the energy range\nfrom 150 GeV to 10 TeV, a positive bias can be observed at energies close to the threshold\nand a negative drop-off can be seen at very high energies. These biases are an intrinsic\nfeature of the reconstruction algorithms and have been well understood using detailed\nMonte Carlo simulations. To diminish any noticeable effect of these biases on the measured\nenergy spectrum, one can limit the lowest and highest energy by requiring that the energy\nbias does not exceed 20% (see, e.g., Aharonian et al. (2006)). Note that the effective energy\nrange chosen for the spectrum evaluation substantially depends on the zenith angle of\nobservations as well as on the actual setup of a system configuration.\n\n8.\n\nSpectral Analysis\n\nDespite the fact that stereoscopic observations with four VERITAS telescopes provide\nvery efficient rejection of the cosmic ray background, the sample of selected \u03b3-ray-like\nevents still contains a substantial fraction of background cosmic rays. In order to remove\nany effect of background on the reconstructed energy spectrum of \u03b3 rays, a similar energy\nreconstruction procedure has to be applied to the events acquired from a number of purely\nbackground regions as defined in the wobble-mode analysis. This enables a proper estimate\nof the background contamination, which has to be subtracted from the signal region. The\nresulting energy-dependent \u03b3-ray rate can be used for the spectrum evaluation by applying\na specific response matrix, which handles various zenith angles, system configurations,\nobservational modes, analysis setups, etc. Such a response matrix represents a complete set\nof effective collection areas of the instrument, which can be derived using detailed Monte\nCarlo simulations. The CORSIKA shower simulation code (see Maier et al. (2007)) was\nused to generate the \u03b3-ray- and cosmic-ray-induced air showers over the accessible range of\nzenith angles and in the energy range between 50 GeV and 100 TeV, assuming the \u03b3-ray\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nenergy spectrum to be a power law with an index of 2.0. Simulations of the VERITAS\nresponse were carried out using the GrISU code, developed by the Grinnell College and\nIowa State University groups (e.g., see Maier et al. (2007)). Simulations were compared\nwith data in great detail. In order to avoid any remaining small energy biases in the\nenergy reconstruction discussed above, it was necessary to compute the effective collection\nareas as a function of the reconstructed energy rather than true shower energy (see, e.g.,\nAharonian et al. (2006)). This helps to complete the unfolding of the intrinsic source\nspectrum.\nThe complete spectrum evaluation procedure has been tested on the Crab Nebula data\ntaken during 2007/2008 observation season. The result is consistent with the previous\nmeasurements of the Crab Nebula spectrum with HEGRA (Aharonian et al. 2004),\nHESS (Aharonian et al. 2006), and MAGIC (Albert et al. 2008), as well as measurements\nmade using VERITAS data but different analysis tools. Spectral analysis of the Cassiopeia A\ndata leads to the energy spectrum\ndN\u03b3\n= (1.26 \u00b1 0.18) \u00d7 10\u221212 (E/1 T eV )\u22122.61\u00b10.24stat \u00b10.2sys cm\u22122 s\u22121 TeV\u22121 ,\ndE\n\n(2)\n\nwith the flux normalization\nF\u03b3 (> 1 T eV ) = (7.76 \u00b1 0.11) \u00d7 10\u221213 cm\u22122 s\u22121 .\n\n(3)\n\nA power-law fit to the Cassiopeia A spectrum yields a \u03c72 = 2.15 for 4 degrees of freedom\nwith a chance probability of P = 0.71%. This result is in good agreement with the HEGRA\nspectrum estimate (Aharonian et al. 2001) as well as the recently published MAGIC\nspectrum (Albert et al. 2007) (see Figure 2). Currently, the rather limited exposure on\nCassiopeia A with VERITAS limits spectral measurements to the energy range from\n300 GeV to 5 TeV. The spectrum measured over this interval does not reveal any break of\na spectral slope or cutoff. Limiting the upper energy bound for the spectral fit at 3 TeV\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nresults in a flatter spectrum index (\u0393=2.4), even though the combination of the statistical\nand systematic errors does not allow us to draw any firm conclusion. Despite the fact that\nno \u03b3-ray events were detected above 6 TeV, the statistical significance of this result is not\nsufficient for any firm statement regarding possible deviation of the spectral shape from a\nsimple power law. Any other, more sophisticated, multi-parameter fit functions are not\nfavored over a simple power law. Adding to the spectral fit an exponential cutoff term,\ndN\u03b3 /dE \u221d E \u2212\u0393 e\u2212E/Eo , does not improve the result but rather degrades the quality of the fit.\nFor the cutoff energy Eo = 2 TeV (\u0393 = 2.35) the fit gives the \u03c72 -value of 3.1 (P = 0.54%).\nFurther reduction of the cutoff energy down to Eo =1 TeV (\u0393 = 1.46) destroys the spectral\nfit (\u03c72 =5.4, P = 0.25%). This result shows that the value of possible high-energy cutoff in\nthe Cassiopeia A spectrum is outside the energy range measured here. Future observations\nwith VERITAS will help to extend the spectral measurements for Cassiopeia A SNR.\n\n9.\n\nDiscussion\n\nUnderstanding the mechanism of particle acceleration in isolated SNR shocks is\nof great interest. The question of whether or not the very-high-energy \u03b3\u2013ray emission\nof Galactic supernova remnants implies a sufficiently high flux of charged cosmic rays,\nmerging into a steady flux of Galactic cosmic rays, remains one of the most stimulating\nrationales for ground-based \u03b3\u2013ray astronomy. Following initial, simplified estimates of the\nexpected \u03b3-ray flux from Galactic SNR (Drury et al. 1994), more refined models have been\ndeveloped to describe particle acceleration in, and high-energy emission from, Cassiopeia A\n(e.g. Atoyan et al. 2000b; Berezhko, P\u00fchlhofer & V\u00f6lk 2003). Cassiopeia A is one of the\nbest-studied SNR in the Galaxy, and a multitude of observations in different wavebands\nconstrain its physical properties and hence the environment in which particle-acceleration\nprocesses operate. The analysis of scattered optical light indicates that Cassiopeia A was of\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\ntype IIb and originated from the collapse of the helium core of a red supergiant that had\nlost most of its hydrogen envelope before exploding (Krause et al. 2008).\nCassiopeia A is a very bright radio (Bell et al. 1975) and X-ray source (Holt et al.\n1994). Borkowski et al. (1996) have modeled the thermal X-ray emission, including\nthe present size and expansion rate. They concluded that the fast wind of the final\nblue-supergiant stage of the progenitor has swept into a dense shell the wind material from\nthe earlier red-supergiant phase. The SNR blast wave has already passed through and\naccelerated the dense (nH \u2243 15 cm\u22123 ) shell of circumstellar material (CSM). About 8 M\u2299 of\nX-ray-emitting swept-up gas is found in Cassiopeia A, mostly in the form of heavy elements\nand predominantly located in the CSM shell and the outer, unperturbed, red-supergiant\nwind (Willingale et al. 2003). The presence of a jet, numerous slow-moving flocculi, and the\ngeneral asymmetry of the remnant requires careful 3-D modeling of the supernova explosion\n(Laming & Hwang 2003; Young et al. 2006), which has recently been used to demonstrate\nthe absence of a WR phase of the progenitor van Veelen et al. (2009).\nThe high gas density combined with the high radio flux observed from Cassiopeia A\npermit an estimate of the magnetic field strength, because the radio-emitting electrons must\nproduce non-thermal bremsstrahlung between 100 MeV and 10 GeV (Cowsik & Sarkar\n1980). An upper limit on the GeV-band flux has been derived using EGRET data\n(Esposito et al. 1996), which in a one-zone model leads to a lower limit on the magnetic\nfield, B & 0.4 mG (Atoyan et al. 2000b). A high magnetic-field strength strongly limits\nthe flux of an inverse-Compton emission component in the TeV band on account of its\ndirect relation to synchrotron X-ray emission (Pohl 1996), which is observed up to 120 keV\n(Allen et al. 1997; Favata et al. 1997). The observed hard X-ray emission also includes lines\nfrom the\n\n44\n\nTi decay chain (Renaud et al. 2006).\n\nThe non-thermal X-ray emission predominantly originates from filaments and knots\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nin the reverse-shock region of Cassiopeia A (Helder & Vink 2008), some of which are\nvariable in flux on timescales of years (Uchiyama & Aharonian 2008). Both the filaments\nthemselves and their flux variability require a strong magnetic field, but estimates of its\nexact amplitude depend on their detailed interpretation. Typically, one obtains somewhat\nhigher values for the magnetic-field strength, if one assumes the size and variability\ntimescale are determined by electron energy losses (Vink & Laming 2003; Uchiyama et al.\n2007; Uchiyama & Aharonian 2008), as opposed to scenarios involving the rapid damping\nof a turbulently amplified field (Pohl et al. 2005) or localized spikes in dynamical magnetic\nturbulence (Bykov et al. 2008). The complicated structure of Cassiopeia A, including\nfast-moving clumps of ejecta and knots of high radio brightness, has triggered the\ndevelopment of many scenarios involving first- and second-order Fermi-type acceleration at\nvarious locations (e.g. Scott & Chevalier 1975; Jones et al. 1994; Atoyan et al. 2000a).\nThe presence of a large flux of high-energy electrons in the reverse-shock region,\nresponsible for the non-thermal radio-to-X-ray emission, will also produce high-energy\n\u03b3-ray emission through non-thermal bremsstrahlung and inverse-Compton scattering\n(e.g. Atoyan et al. 2000b). Based on that leptonic emission, Cassiopeia A would\nappear in VERITAS data as a disk- or ring-like source with outer radius Rl . 2\u2032\n(Uchiyama & Aharonian 2008). If, on the other hand, the VHE \u03b3-ray emission from\nCassiopeia A were dominated by \u03c0 o -decay photons produced in inelastic collisions of\nrelativistic protons, the location of the particle-acceleration sites is less constrained by\ndata in other wavebands, and substantial acceleration of cosmic-ray protons could proceed\nat the outer blast wave (Berezhko, P\u00fchlhofer & V\u00f6lk 2003). The size of Cassiopeia A\nin VERITAS data could therefore be slightly larger than for leptonic scenarios, with an\nouter radius Rh . 2.5\u2032 . However, both predicted angular extensions are substantially less\nthan the current angular resolution of VERITAS. The VERITAS data are consistent with\na point-like \u03b3-ray source. Since the extended TeV \u03b3-ray emission has not been resolved\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nwith VERITAS yet, current results remain fully consistent with the hypothesis that the\nVHE \u03b3-ray emission originates from the central part of Cassiopeia A, where a compact\nobject has been observed at longer wavelengths. Nevertheless, we encourage modeling the\nspatial distribution of VHE \u03b3-ray emission from Cassiopeia A in preparation for the next\ngeneration of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, CTA1 and AGIS2 , both of which\nare projected to have an angular resolution better than that of VERITAS by a factor of at\nleast 2.\nNone of the published calculations of VHE \u03b3-ray production correctly predict both\nthe flux and the spectrum observed with VERITAS. Atoyan et al. (2000a,b) have carefully\nmodelled the acceleration, propagation, and photon-emission spectra of high-energy\nelectrons. For the parameters chosen for their displayed \u03b3-ray spectra, the TeV-band\nemission is a mixture of non-thermal bremsstrahlung and inverse-Compton scattering that\nwould account for about 25% of the flux observed with VERITAS and feature a softer\nspectrum than observed (\u221d E\u03b3\u22123.2 ). We can speculate that a better fit may be achieved by\na small reduction of the magnetic-field strength and/or an increase in the cut-off energy of\nthe electron injection spectrum, which astrophysically is determined by the details of the\nacceleration process, the magnetic-field strength in the acceleration region, and efficiency\nlimitations imposed by the geometry of the acceleration region. However, a low GeV-band\nflux measurement or upper limit derived with Fermi-LAT would imply a magnetic field\nstronger than that assumed by Atoyan et al. (2000b).\nModels of hadronic VHE \u03b3-ray emission are somewhat less constrained by radio and\nX-ray data than are their leptonic counterparts. An indirect relation exists in that a very\nefficient acceleration of cosmic-ray nuclei by shock fronts leads to a modification of such\n1\n\nwww.cta-observatory.org\n\n2\n\nwww.agis-observatory.org\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nshocks, resulting in relatively soft spectra below a GeV particle energy and rather hard\nspectra around a TeV (e.g. Blandford & Eichler 1987; Berezhko & Ellison 1999), although\na cosmic-ray-induced strong magnetic field can substantially reduce the shock modification\ncompared with the naive unmagnetized case (Caprioli et al. 2008). The soft radio spectrum\nobserved from Cassiopeia A is indeed consistent with non-linear kinetic models of cosmic-ray\nacceleration in SNR (e.g. Berezhko, P\u00fchlhofer & V\u00f6lk 2003). However, the hard spectra\npredicted beyond a particle energy of 1 TeV have not been observed to date. In fact, the\nVHE \u03b3-ray spectra measured from shell-type SNR are all well described by either a power\nlaw with photon index s . \u22122.2, or a power law with gradual roll-off (e.g. Huang et al.\n2007); this suggests that the acceleration of cosmic-ray protons beyond 1 TeV must be less\nefficient than previously thought, if the observed VHE \u03b3-ray emission completely arises\nfrom interactions of these protons.\nExcept for the electron energy losses, the high-energy cut-off in the spectrum of\naccelerated protons is determined by the same physical processes as that of the electrons,\nthe details of which are not well understood. The published models may therefore be too\noptimistic in predicting the cut-off energy (e.g. Berezhko, P\u00fchlhofer & V\u00f6lk 2003). In\nany case, more work is required to better understand the high-energy end of cosmic-ray\nproton spectra accelerated in SNR (e.g. Ellison & Vladimirov 2008). In addition, the role\nstochastic particle acceleration plays in SNR needs to be explored in more detail (Liu et al.\n2008). Observationally, the next step toward a better understanding of particle acceleration\nin Cassiopeia A will be measuring the GeV-band \u03b3-ray spectrum with the Fermi-LAT.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was supported by grants from the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S.\nNational Science Foundation and the Smithsonian Institution, by NSERC in Canada,\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nby Science Foundation Ireland and by STFC in the UK.
