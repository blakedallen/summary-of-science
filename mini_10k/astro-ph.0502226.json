INTRODUCTION\n\nObservations of galaxy clusters are increasingly used\nto constrain cosmological parameters. Reliable determinations of the cluster mass, abundance of clusters as a\nfunction of redshift (e.g. Haiman et al. (2001)), and gas\nfraction (e.g. Vikhlinin et al. (2003)) lead to independent constraints on \u03a9M , \u03a9b , and the dark energy equation of state parameter w (see e.g. Pen (1997), Sasaki\n(1996), Allen et al. (2004)). In most cases, extraction\nof cosmological parameters from clusters requires a high\nprecision measurement of cluster mass, often for a large\nsample of clusters. It is therefore critical to understand\nwhether existing or planned X-ray or SZE observations\ncan yield sufficiently precise measurements to permit accurate determinations of cosmological parameters.\nHistorically, cluster gas mass is often deduced from the\nX-ray temperature using an empirical relation between\nmass and spectral temperature with relatively small scatter for high mass clusters (e.g. Sanderson et al. (2003)).\nThe X-ray surface brightness of a cluster results from the\nemission along the line of sight,\nZ\nZ\n1\nn\nn\n\u039b(T\n)dl\n\u221d\nn2 T 1/2 dl (1)\nSX =\ne H\n4\u03c0(1 + z)4\nwhere the proportionality holds if \u039b includes only\nbremsstrahlung emission; which is a reasonable approximation for massive clusters of galaxies. In reality, the\nemission function will include both resonance lines and\nfree-free emission.\n1 Current Affiliation: Department of Physics and Astronomy,\nLouisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA 70803\nElectronic address: motl@rouge.phys.lsu.edu\n\nIn contrast, the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZE) arises\nfrom the inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons by electrons in the hot\nplasma of clusters of galaxies (Sunyaev & Zeldovich\n1972). The strength of the thermal SZE is proportional\nto the Compton parameter, y, which for non-relativistic\nelectrons is essentially the integral of the gas pressure\nthrough the cluster\nZ\nZ\nkB T\n\u03c3\nn\ndl\n\u221d\nnT dl.\n(2)\ny=\nT e\nme c2\nFor very hot clusters, relativistic corrections must be included (Itoh et al. 1998). The central value of the Compton y parameter will be referred to as y0 . We also consider integrals of the Compton parameter over a finite\nprojected radius; for example y500 is the integral of y\nover a disk with of radius r500 corresponding to an overdensity of 500 relative to the critical density.\nFrom the above discussion, these two cluster observables depend differently on the state of the cluster gas.\nThe X-ray emission is more sensitive to the density, and\nso one might expect X-ray observations to provide a better constraint on the cluster mass. However, this strong\ndensity dependence means that the emission is dominated by the cluster core, where the gas is subject to\nmany complicating effects, including both cooling and\nheating.\nThe two methods also have very different selection\nbiases. By its nature, the SZE is redshift independent (Carlstrom et al. 2002) and observations of clusters\nthrough this window hold great promise to test cosmological models. Since the thermal SZE measures the integral of the gas pressure and assuming that the gas out-\n\n\f2\nside the core is in approximate hydrostatic equilibrium\nwithin the dark matter potential, one expects that SZE\nobservations should provide robust measures of the cluster mass - independent of the complicated interplay of\nphysical mechanisms that regulate the thermal state of\nthe cluster gas (e.g. Barbosa et al. (1996),Benson et al.\n(2004)).\nTo investigate this expectation, we have constructed\nfour catalogs of simulated clusters of galaxies that differ only in the assumed input physics for the baryonic\ncomponent. Each sample contains \u223c 100 clusters at\nthe present epoch in the mass range from 1014 M\u2299\nto 2 \u00d7 1015 M\u2299 and \u223c 10 clusters more massive than\n1014 M\u2299 at a redshift of 2, roughly corresponding to the\nexpected sensitivity of upcoming SZE telescopes.\nIn this Letter, we use ideal synthetic observations of\nthe thermal SZE and X-rays to measure how cluster observables scale with cluster mass. Since no instrumental\neffects are included, this study indicates the minimum errors one can expect in these relations. Evaluating typical\nscaling relations for clusters reveals that the integrated\nSZE is a surprisingly accurate and simple method for determining the mass of clusters. Thus, SZE observations\nhave a high potential for precision measures of fundamental cosmological parameters.\n\nTemperature\n\nX-ray\nAdiabatic\n\nThermal SZE\n\nRadiative Cooling\n\nStar Formation\n\nStar Formation Feedback\n\n2. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS\n\nOur simulations use the hybrid Eulerian adaptive mesh\nrefinement/N-body code Enzo (O'Shea et al. (2004);\nhttp://cosmos.ucsd.edu/enzo) to evolve both the dark\nmatter and baryonic fluid in the clusters, utilizing the\npiecewise parabolic method (PPM) for the hydrodynamics. With up to seven levels of dynamic refinement in\nhigh density regions, we attain spatial resolution up to\n\u223c 16 h\u22121 kpc in the clusters. We assume a concordance \u039bCDM cosmological model with the following parameters: \u03a9b = 0.026, \u03a9m = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, h = 0.7,\nand \u03c38 = 0.928. Refinement of high density regions is\nperformed as described in Motl et al. (2004). We have\nconstructed a catalog of AMR refined clusters identified\nin the simulation volume as described in Loken et al.\n(2002). The four catalogs progressively include additional physical processes in the calculation. Our baseline\ncatalog was run with only adiabatic physics, a second\nincludes the effects of radiative cooling, a third adds a\nmodel for the loss of low entropy gas to stars, and a final\nsimulation adds a moderate amount of supernova feedback to the star formation prescription.\nThe loss of energy to radiation is calculated from\na tabulated cooling curve derived from a RaymondSmith plasma emission model (Brickhouse et al. 1995)\nassuming a constant metallicity of 0.3 relative to solar. For the simulation runs including star formation, we\nhave incorporated the star formation prescription from\nCen & Ostriker (1992).\nBriefly, for every most refined cell, if the gas is contracting, cooling rapidly, and contains more than a Jeans\nmass of material, a new star particle is created with a\nmass mb \u03b7 \u2206t/tdyn and this amount of mass is removed\nfrom the fluid. The star formation rate is thus coupled\nto the local dynamical time, tdyn , while \u03b7 parameterizes\nthe efficiency of star formation and \u2206t is the simulation\ntimestep increment. In the simulation including feedback\nfrom stars, the new star particle begins to deposit energy\n\nFig. 1.- Images of the projected, emission-weighted temperature\nmap (left column), normalized X-ray surface brightness (middle\ncolumn) and the Compton parameter, y (right column). Each row\ndisplays the same cluster evolved in the indicated physical limit\nat the present epoch. The field of view is 5 h\u22121 M pc on a side.\nThe color table for each image is set by the range of values in\nthe adiabatic realization. This particular cluster has a total mass,\nM200 (\u223c Mvirial ) \u223c 2 \u00d7 1015 M\u2299 . In reality, clusters should be\nintermediate between the limiting cases of radiative cooling only\n(which produces too many clusters with cool cores) and the star\nformation feedback model (which produces too few).\n\nin the fluid to simulate the explosion of prompt, type II\nsupernovae.\n3. RESULTS\n\nFigure 1 depicts typical simulation results from the\nfour cluster samples that we have considered. The most\ndramatic difference between the samples is the rich array of cool substructures in the cooling only simulation.\nThese cool cores and their associated shock features are\nvery conspicuous in the temperature map and X-ray image. While there is significant variation between clusters\nwhen viewed through their X-ray emission directly or\nthrough the derived temperature maps, the thermal SZE\nyields a quite similar appearance for the clusters - even\nin the extreme case of cooling only.\n3.1. The Effect of Cluster Mergers\n\nThe bias introduced by structure formation itself raises\npotential concerns, independent of the complexities of\n\n\f3\nTABLE 1\nScaling Exponent for y500 \u2212 M Relation, z=0\nSimulation\nAdiabatic\nRadiative Cooling\nStar Formation\nStar Formation with Feedback\n\n\u03b1\n1.59\n1.71\n1.60\n1.61\n\n\u03c3\u03b1\n0.021\n0.031\n0.027\n0.024\n\nthe detailed physics governing energy balance in the cluster gas. Generally, we find that the central value of the\nCompton parameter (y0 ) can be boosted by up to a factor of \u223c 20 in head on collisions between equal mass subclusters. These major mergers can drive the evolution of\nthe central SZE signal over time periods of 1 \u2212 2 tdyn or\n\u223c 2 Gyr. Furthermore, even minor mergers (which are\nmore common) with a mass ratio of \u223c 0.1 can produce\nsignificant boosts in y0 by a factor of \u223c 2.\nOn a cluster by cluster basis, merger boosts will bias\nmeasurements derived from the cluster properties to,\nfor example, overestimate the mass of the cluster corresponding to a given SZE signal. In a survey of clusters, merger boosts will scatter systems with equilibrium\nvalues below the detection threshold (which are more numerous) into the sample.\nWhile mergers significantly impact y0 , they do not impact the value of y500 as drastically. Measuring the integrated SZE out to a significant radius has the effect\nof de-emphasizing the core properties of the cluster, and\nso the integrated SZE is less sensitive to the dynamical\nstate of the cluster, as well as to the details of the cluster\nphysics as we show below.\n3.2. Thermal SZE Scaling Relations\n\nThe comparison of the y500 \u2212 M500 relation with the\ny0 \u2212 M relation is shown in the upper panels of Figure\n2 for the star formation with feedback sample. The y0\nscaling shows a much larger scatter than y500 , and so\nmass estimation using the central value of the Compton\nparameter is correspondingly poorer. To illustrate the\nreason for this discrepancy, we show in the bottom panels of Figure 2 both the central pressure in each cluster,\nand the integrated pressure inside a sphere of radius r500\nas functions of mass. y0 is essentially a measure of the\npressure integrated along the line of sight through the\ncluster center. However, the integrated SZE, y500 , measures the projected integrated pressure inside r500 . It\nis clear from these plots that while the central pressure\nis weakly correlated with cluster mass, the value of the\npressure integrated out to a large radius is a very good\npredictor of the mass. This difference is a result of a variety of effects, including both mergers and non-adiabatic\nphysics, which dominate the cluster cores. Observing the\nintegrated SZE signal more effectively samples the cluster potential depth by measuring the integrated pressure\nout to a large radius, leading to a tight correlation of the\nstrength of the signal with cluster mass. Looking back in\ntime through our catalogs of simulated clusters, we find\nthat all four samples produce similar predictions for the\nscaling between y500 and M500 . These predictions are\nroughly consistent with the expectations of self-similar\nscaling for clusters, up to a redshift of 1.5 for which we\nhave a sufficient number of clusters in our simulations.\nTable 1 shows the scaling exponent and the variance for\n\nTABLE 2\nAccuracy of Mass Estimation, z=0\nMethod\nMedian Mest /Mtrue\ny500 \u2212 M\n0.97\nTX \u2212 M\n1.04\nLX,500 \u2212 M\n0.87\ny0 \u2212 M\n0.96\n\n+1\u03c3\n1.00\n1.11\n1.03\n1.14\n\n-1\u03c3\n0.93\n0.92\n0.75\n0.82\n\n+80%\n1.13\n1.33\n1.46\n1.53\n\n-80%\n0.86\n0.74\n0.62\n0.67\n\neach of the four samples at z = 0, where the scaling\nrelation is written as\n\u0015\u03b1\n\u0014\nM500\n.\n(3)\ny500 = A\n1014 M\u2299\nThe values of the exponent \u03b1 shown in the table are\nconsistent with previous work by da Silva et al. (2004).\nWhile the detailed simulation of clusters incorporating\nall relevant physics remains an unfulfilled challenge, it\nis reassuring that all models considered by us to date\npredict similar properties for the integrated SZE. This\nresults from the weak dependence of the integrated SZE\non the state of the cluster core. Therefore, the interpretation and modeling of SZE observations of clusters\nshould be relatively immune to theoretical uncertainties\nand SZE surveys will provide excellent opportunities for\nconstraining cosmological parameters.\n3.3. Cluster Mass Estimates\n\nThe relationship between X-ray spectral temperature\nand cluster mass (M \u2212 TX ) is well documented and a\nsimilar relation is noted in cosmological simulations (e.g.,\nBryan & Norman (1998)). This relationship is often used\nto infer cluster masses. For comparison to the y500 \u2212 M\nrelation studied here, we have measured several other\nscaling relations, including M \u2212 TX , for the simulated\nclusters.TX is in this case calculated as the X-ray emission weighted average temperature inside a projected radius of r500 . We then use the best-fit scaling relations\nderived from the star formation with feedback simulation to determine the total cluster mass. Table 2 shows\nthe ratio of estimated mass to true mass for four different\nscaling relations at z=0.\nWe find that the integrated thermal SZE signal within\na characteristic radius of r500 is the best estimator of\nthe true cluster mass among these scaling relations. For\nexample, 80% of clusters have estimated masses that lie\nwithin +15% to \u221210% of the true cluster mass and this\naccuracy is nearly constant with redshift back to at least\nz = 1.5. The y0 value is a much poorer estimate of the\ntrue cluster mass, as is expected from the relative scatter\nof y0 \u2212 M shown in Figure 2. Core effects also have a\nstrong impact on the X-ray luminosity, because of its\nenhanced density dependence. Therefore the scaling of\nX-ray luminosity with cluster mass is the poorest of these\nscaling relations.\nThe M \u2212TX relation for clusters in the simulation generates relative errors of \u00b130% in mass for 80% of clusters. Rasia et al. (2005) show that, from simulations, a\n1\u03c3 scatter of 30% in the M \u2212 TX relation is reduced to\n16% when using their spectroscopic-like temperature in\nplace of the emission weighted temperature. A similar\ndrop in the scatter of the mass estimates quoted here\nfor 80% of the clusters would make the M \u2212 TX relation roughly equivalent to y500 \u2212 M in predictive power.\n\n\f4\n\ny500\n\nCentral Compton Value\n\nIntegrated Pressure\n\nCentral Pressure\n\nFig. 2.- Upper: The scaling relations between projected y0 and y500 and the total cluster mass within the same radius at the present\nepoch for the star formation with feedback cluster sample. Two randomly chosen, orthogonal projections for each cluster are plotted as\nindividual points and the catalog contains \u223c 100 clusters at this epoch in the mass range 1014 M\u2299 \u2264 M200 \u2264 2 \u00d7 1015 M\u2299 . The best\nfit relations are plotted as solid lines. Lower: Central pressure and pressure integrated inside sphere of radius r500 plotted against cluster\ntotal mass.\n\nHowever, this analysis includes no instrumental effects;\na detailed study of the additional error introduced using\nreal observations remains to be done in order to gauge\nthe effectiveness of these methods. Certainly, measuring\nthe value of y500 requires no assumptions about the state\nof the cluster gas, nor any model fitting, whereas X-ray\ntemperature is generally fit to a model assuming uniform\ntemperature and metallicity within the gas. SZE observations also can be done for a larger number of clusters,\nand at higher redshifts, than X-ray observations. In any\ncase, of the methods tested here, the integrated SZE scaling relation is superior at estimating cluster masses.\n4. CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe integrated SZE in clusters of galaxies is not\nstrongly dependent on the details of cluster physics or\nvariation in the cluster core in contrast to the X-ray luminosity.\nWhile the value of y0 experiences strong \"boosting\"\ndue to mergers, the value of y500 appears to be much less\n\nsensitive to transient events. Measuring the SZE out to\nlarger radii has the effect of smoothing out the impact of\nmergers.\nThe y500 \u2212 M relation is the simplest, least model dependent, and most accurate measure of cluster mass.\nAn unprecedented number of clusters will be observed\nthrough the SZE in the near future. Clusters observed\nthrough the SZE therefore show great promise as precision cosmological probes.\n\nThe simulations presented in this work were conducted\nat the National Center for Supercomputing Applications\nat the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign through\ncomputer allocation grant AST010014N.
