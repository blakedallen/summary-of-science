The self-consistent description of the spin corrections to the equations of motion is built with the noncovariant description of spin and with the usual,\n\"na\u0131\u0308ve\" definition of the coordinate of a relativistic particle.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe pioneering paper [1] by Myron Mathisson on the relativistic equations of motion for\nspinning particle in a gravitational field was published in Acta Physica Polonica. I truly\nappreciate the invitation to submit a review on the subject to this journal.\nThe general problem of the motion of a relativistic particle with internal angular momentum (spin) in external electromagnetic and gravitational fields consists of two parts: the\ndescription of the spin precession and accounting for the spin influence on the trajectory of\nparticle motion.\nAs to the first part of the problem, that of the spin evolution by itself, it is essentially\nsettled, starting with the paper by Mathisson [1] (see also [2]). A relatively simple derivation\nof the corresponding relativistic equations, both in electrodynamics and gravity, is presented\nbelow, together with the detailed discussion of the limits of applicability for these equations.\nThe situation is different with the second part of the problem, i.e., how the interaction\nof spin with an external field influences the trajectory of a particle. On the one hand, there\nis an old prejudice according to which for elementary particles this influence is unobservable\nby virtue of the uncertainty relation. On the other hand, there are serious disagreements on\nthe exact form of the effect.\nThe discussed effect in electromagnetic field is of real physical interest, being related\nto the problem of separating different polarizations of relativistic particles in accelerators.\nHowever, as mentioned, it is not as obvious whether one can observe in practice the discussed\nspin corrections to the equations of motion of elementary particles, for instance, electron or\nproton. According to the well-known observation by Bohr (quoted in [3]), an additional\nLorentz force due to the finite size of the wave packet of a charged particle and to the\nuncertainty relation, is on the same order of magnitude as the corresponding component\nof the Stern-Gerlach force. However, this argument by itself does not exclude in principle\nthe possibility to observe a regular Stern-Gerlach effect, even a small one, in the presence\nof a comparable background due to the uncertainty relation. It is sufficient to recall quite\n1\n\nkhriplovich@inp.nsk.su\n\n1\n\n\fcommon situation when the accuracy with which the energy of an unstable level is known,\nis much better than the width of this level.\nBesides, not only spin-dependent correlations certainly exist in differential cross sections\nof scattering processes, but they are effectively used to separate particles of different polarizations. That is why it was proposed long ago to separate charged particles of different\npolarizations in a storage ring through the spin interaction with external fields [4]. Though\nthis proposal is discussed rather actively (see, for instance, review [5]), it is not clear up to\nnow whether it is feasible technically.\nOn the other hand, certainly there are macroscopic objects for which internal rotation\ninfluences their trajectories. We mean the motion of Kerr black holes in external gravitational\nfields. This problem is of importance in particular for the calculation of the gravitational\nradiation of binary stars. In this connection it was considered in [6 \u2013 9]. However, the\nequations of motion taking account of the spin influence to lowest nonvanishing order in c\u22122 ,\nused in these papers, lead to results which differ from the well-known gravitational spin-orbit\ninteraction even in the simpler case of an external field. As will be demonstrated below, the\ndisagreement originates from different definitions of the center-of-mass coordinate. In the\nanalysis of this disagreement and in the solution of the problem we follow [10, 11].\n\n2\n\nEquations of Motion of Spin in Electromagnetic Field\n\nThe equations of motion for spin of a relativistic particle in electromagnetic field are well\nknown. However, since the general problem of the spin interaction with external gravitational\nfield reduces to the analogous problem for the case of an external electromagnetic field, it is\npertinent to start the detailed analysis of the subject in this way. Besides, the subtleties with\nthe definition of the center-of-mass coordinate can be essentially elucidated in this problem,\nwhich is somewhat more simple than the gravitational one.\n\n2.1\n\nCovariant Equation of Motion of Spin\n\nLet us consider at first the spin precession for a nonrelativistic charged particle. The equation\nthat describes this precession is well known:\n\u1e61 =\n\neg\n[s \u00d7 B] .\n2m\n\n(1)\n\nHere B is an external magnetic field, e and m are the charge and mass of the particle, g is\nits gyromagnetic ratio (for electron g \u2248 2). In other words, the spin precesses around the\ndirection of magnetic field with the frequency \u2212(eg/2m)B. In the same nonrelativistic limit\nthe velocity precesses around the direction of B with the frequency \u2212(e/m)B:\nv\u0307 =\n\ne\n[v \u00d7 B] .\nm\n\n(2)\n\nThus, for g = 2 spin and velocity precess with the same frequency, so that the angle between\nthem is conserved.\n2\n\n\fLet us note that both equations, (1) and (2), hold as Heisenberg equations of motion\nin an external field for the spin and velocity operators, s and v. On the other hand, being\naveraged over properly localized wave packets, these equations go over into the (semi)classical\nequations of motion for spin and velocity. This refers also to the relativistic generalizations\nof equation (1), discussed in this section below.\nWe will consider at first the covariant semiclassical formalism using the four-dimensional\nvector of spin S\u03bc . This 4-vector is defined as follows. In the particle rest frame S\u03bc has no\ntime component and reduces to the common three-dimensional vector of spin s, i.e., in this\nframe S\u03bc = (0, s). In the reference frame where the particle moves with velocity v, the vector\nS\u03bc is constructed from (0, s) by means of the Lorentz transformation, so that here\nS0 = \u03b3vs ,\n\nS=s+\n\n\u03b3 2 v(vs)\n.\n\u03b3+1\n\n(3)\n\nThen, just by definition of S\u03bc , the following identities take place:\nS\u03bc S\u03bc = \u2212s2 (= const),\n\nS\u03bc u \u03bc = 0 ;\n\n(4)\n\nas usual, here u\u03bc is the four-velocity. It should be emphasized that it is just the velocity,\nwhich is a parameter of the Lorentz group, that enters these relations (but not the canonical\nmomentum, which is not even a gauge-invariant vector).\nThe right-hand side of the equation for dS\u03bc /d\u03c4 (here and below \u03c4 is the proper time)\nshould be linear and homogeneous both in the electromagnetic field strength F\u03bc\u03bd , and in\nthe same four-vector S\u03bc , and may depend also on u\u03bc . By virtue of the first identity (4),\nthe right-hand side should be four-dimensionally orthogonal to S\u03bc . Therefore, the general\nstructure of the equation we are looking for is\ndS\u03bc\n= \u03b1F\u03bc\u03bd S\u03bd + \u03b2u\u03bcF\u03bd\u03bb u\u03bd S\u03bb .\nd\u03c4\n\n(5)\n\nComparing the nonrelativistic limit of this equation with (1), we find\n\u03b1=\n\neg\n.\n2m\n\nNow we take into account the second identity (4), which after differentiation in \u03c4 gives\nu\u03bc\n\ndu\u03bc\ndS\u03bc\n= \u2212S\u03bc\n,\nd\u03c4\nd\u03c4\n\nand recall the classical equation of motion for a charge:\nm\n\ndu\u03bc\n= eF\u03bc\u03bd u\u03bd .\nd\u03c4\n\nThen, multiplying equation (5) by u\u03bc , we obtain\n\u03b2=\u2212\n\ne\n(g \u2212 2) .\n2m\n3\n\n(6)\n\n\fThus, the covariant equation of motion for spin is [12 \u2013 14]\ndS\u03bc\neg\ne\n=\nF\u03bc\u03bd S\u03bd \u2212\n(g \u2212 2)u\u03bc F\u03bd\u03bb u\u03bd S\u03bb .\nd\u03c4\n2m\n2m\n\n(7)\n\nLet us discuss the limits of applicability for this equation.\nOf course, typical distances at which the trajectory changes (for instance, the Larmor\nradius in a magnetic field) should be large as compared to the de Broglie wave length h\u0304/p\nof the elementary particle. Then, the external field itself should not change essentially at\nthe distances on the order of both the de Broglie wave length h\u0304/p and the Compton wave\nlength h\u0304/(mc) of the particle. In particular, if the last condition does not hold, the scatter\nof velocities in the rest frame is not small as compared to c, and one cannot use in this frame\nthe nonrelativistic formulae.\nBesides, if the external field changes rapidly, the motion of spin will be influenced by\ninteraction of higher electromagnetic multipoles of the particle with field gradients. For a\nparticle of spin 1/2 higher multipoles are absent, and the gradient-dependent effects are due\nto finite form factors of the particle. These effects start here at least in second order in field\ngradients and usually are negligible.\nAt last, in equation (7) we confine to effects of first order in the external field. This\napproximation relies in fact on the implicit assumption that the first-order interaction with\nthe external field is less than the excitation energy of the spinning system. Usually this\nassumption is true and the first-order equation (7) is valid. Still, one can easily point out\nsituations when this is not the case. To be definite, let us consider the hydrogen-like ion 3 He+\nin the ground s-state with the total spin F = 1. It can be easily demonstrated that an already\nquite moderate external magnetic field is sufficient to break the hyperfine interaction between\nthe electron and nuclear magnetic moments (a sort of Paschen-Back effect). Then, instead\nof a precession of the total spin F of the ion, which should be described by equations (1) or\n(7) with a corresponding ion g-factor, we will have a separate precession of the decoupled\nelectron and nuclear spins.\nLet us go back now to equation (7). We note that for g = 2 and in the absence of electric\nfield, its zeroth component reduces to\ndS0\n= 0.\nd\u03c4\nTaking into account definition (3) for S0 and the fact that in a magnetic field a particle energy\nremains constant, we find immediately that the projection of spin s onto velocity, so-called\nhelicity, is conserved.\n\n2.2\n\nNoncovariant Equation of Motion for Spin\nof Relativistic Particle. Thomas Precession\n\nWe will obtain now the relativistic equation for the three-dimensional vector of spin s, that\ndirectly describes the internal angular momentum of a particle in its \"momentary\" rest\nframe. This equation can be derived from (7) using relations (3), together with the equations\n4\n\n\fof motion for a charge in external field. It will require, however, quite tedious calculations.\nTherefore, we choose another way, somewhat more simple and much more instructive.\nFirst, we transform equation (1) from the comoving inertial frame, where the particle is\nat rest, into the laboratory one. The magnetic field B\u2032 in the rest frame is expressed via the\nelectric and magnetic fields E and B given in the laboratory frame, as follows:\nB\u2032 = \u03b3B \u2212\n\n\u03b32\nv(vB) \u2212 \u03b3v \u00d7 E .\n\u03b3+1\n\nThis expression can be easily checked by comparing it component by component with the\ntransformation of magnetic field for two cases: when this field is parallel to the velocity and\northogonal to it, respectively. Then one should take into account that the frequency in the\nlaboratory time t is \u03b3 times smaller than the frequency in the laboratory time \u03c4 (indeed,\nd/dt = d\u03c4 /dt * d/d\u03c4 = \u03b3 \u22121 d/d\u03c4 ). Found in this way contribution to the precession frequency\nis\n\"\n#\neg\n\u03b3\n\u03c9g = \u2212\nB\u2212\nv(vB) \u2212 v \u00d7 E .\n2m\n\u03b3+1\nHowever it is clear from equation (7) that spin precesses even if g = 0. To elucidate the\norigin of this effect, the so-called Thomas precession [15], we consider two successive Lorentz\ntransformations: at first from the laboratory frame S into the frame S \u2032 that moves with the\nvelocity v with respect to S, and then from S \u2032 into the frame S \u2032\u2032 that moves with respect to\nS \u2032 with the infinitesimal velocity dv. Let us recall in this connection the following fact related\nto usual three-dimensional rotations: the result of two successive rotations with respect to\nnoncollinear axes n1 and n2 contains in particular a rotation around the axis directed along\ntheir vector product n1 \u00d7 n2 . Now it is only natural to assume that the result of the above\nsuccessive Lorentz transformations will contain in particular a usual rotation around the axis\ndirected along dv \u00d7 v. In result, spin in the rest frame will rotate in the opposite direction by\nan angle which we denote by \u03ba [ dv \u00d7 v ]. Here \u03ba is some numerical factor to be determined\nbelow. It depends generally speaking on the particle energy.\nThis is in fact the Thomas precession. Its frequency in the proper time \u03c4 is\n\u03c9 \u2032T = \u03ba[ dv/d\u03c4 \u00d7 v ] = \u03ba\n\ne\n[ E\u2032 \u00d7 v ].\nm\n\nNow we transform the electric field E\u2032 from the proper frame into the laboratory one, as it\nwas done above for the magnetic field B\u2032 , and go over also from the proper time \u03c4 to t. In\nresult, the frequency of the Thomas precession in the laboratory frame is\ne\n\u03c9T = \u03ba\nm\n\n\"\n\ne\nm\nTo find the coefficient \u03ba, we recall\nonto the velocity is conserved. In\n= \u2212\u03ba\n\n!\n\n\u03b3\nE\u2212\nv(vE) + v \u00d7 B \u00d7 v\n\u03b3+1\nh\n\ni\n\n#\n\nv \u00d7 E \u2212 v 2 B + v(vB) .\n\nthat in a magnetic field, for g = 2 the projection of spin\nother words, in this case the total frequency of the spin\n5\n\n\fprecession \u03c9 = \u03c9 g + \u03c9 T coincides with the frequency of the velocity precession which is well\nknown to be\ne\nB.\n\u03c9v = \u2212\nm\u03b3\nFrom this we find easily that \u03ba = \u03b3/(\u03b3 + 1) . Correspondingly, the relativistic equation of\nmotion for the three-dimensional vector of spin s in external electromagnetic field is\nds\ne\n= (\u03c9 g + \u03c9 T ) \u00d7 s =\ndt\n2m\n\n(\n\n!\n\n2\ng\u22122+\n[s \u00d7 B]\n\u03b3\n!\n\n)\n\n2\u03b3\n\u03b3\n[s \u00d7 [v \u00d7 E]] .\n[s \u00d7 v](vB) \u2212 g \u2212\n\u2212 (g \u2212 2)\n\u03b3+1\n\u03b3+1\n\n2.3\n\n(8)\n\nRelativistic Spin Hamiltonian\n\nThe relativistic Hamiltonian for the interaction of the three-dimensional vector of spin with\nexternal electromagnetic field is written in the usual form:\nH = \u03c9s .\n\n(9)\n\nNot only does it generate via the standard relation\nds\ni\n= [H, s]\n(10)\ndt\nh\u0304\nequation (8). For instance, it is easy to obtain with this Hamiltonian equations of motion\nof the quadrupole moment of a relativistic particle in electric and magnetic fields, neglecting\nthe field gradients. In the particle rest frame, the operator of its quadrupole moment is\nqmn =\n\n2\n3q\nsm sn + sn sm \u2212 s(s + 1)\u03b4 mn ;\n2s(2s \u2212 1)\n3\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\nhere the structure in square brackets guarantees the symmetry and vanishing trace of this\noperator, qmn = qnm , qmm = 0; the overall factor at the square brackets corresponds to the\nnormalization condition qzz = q for sz = s.

So, the validity of this Hamiltonian is beyond any doubts.\nIn particular, interaction (9) can be effectively used to derive the additional spin-dependent\nforce acting upon a charged particle in an external electromagnetic field [16]. However, since\n\u03c9 depends directly on the particle velocity v (but not on its momentum p), it is somewhat\nmore convenient to employ here the Lagrangian (but not Hamiltonian) formalism with\nL = \u2212 \u03c9s .\nWe will come back to the spin-dependent forces later.\n6\n\n(12)\n\n\f3\n\nSpin Precession in Gravitational Field\n\nIn this section we present a simple and general derivation of the equations of the spin precession in a gravitational field (restricting to first order in spin), based on a remarkable analogy\nbetween gravitational and electromagnetic fields. Due to this correspondence, the formulae\nof the previous section are naturally adapted for the case of an external gravitational field.\nIn this way we easily reproduce and generalize known results for gravitational spin effects.\n\n3.1\n\nGeneral Relations\n\nIt follows from the angular momentum conservation in flat space-time taken together with\nthe equivalence principle that the 4-vector of spin S \u03bc is parallel transported along the particle\nworld-line. The parallel transport of a vector along a geodesic x\u03bc (\u03c4 ) means that its covariant\nderivative vanishes:\nDS \u03bc\n= 0.\n(13)\nD\u03c4\nWe will use the tetrad formalism natural for the description of spin. The tetrad components\nof spin\nS a = S \u03bc ea\u03bc\n(by the first letters of the Latin alphabet, a, b, c, d, we label here and below four-dimensional\ntetrad indices) behave as vectors under Lorentz transformations of the locally inertial frame.\nHowever, they do not change under generally covariant transformations x\u03bc = f \u03bc (x\u2032 ). In other\nwords, the four components S a are world scalars. Therefore, in virtue of relation (13), the\nequations for them appear as follows:\nDS a\ndS a\n=\n= S \u03bc ea\u03bc; \u03bd u\u03bd = \u03b7 ab \u03b3bcd ud S c .\nd\u03c4\nD\u03c4\n\n(14)\n\nThe covariant derivative of a tetrad is by definition\nea\u03bc; \u03bd = \u2202 \u03bd ea\u03bc \u2212 \u0393\u03ba\u03bc\u03bd ea\u03ba ,\nand the quantity\n\n\u03b3abc = ea\u03bc; \u03bd e\u03bcb e\u03bdc\n\n(15)\n\nis the Ricci rotation coefficient. By means of covariant differentiation of the identity ea\u03bc e\u03bcb =\n\u03b7ab , one can easily demonstrate that these coefficients are antisymmetric in the first pair of\nindices:\n\u03b3abc = \u2212\u03b3bac .\n(16)\nOf course, the equations for the tetrad components of a 4-velocity look exactly in the\nsame way as those for spin:\ndua\n= \u03b7 ab \u03b3bcd ud uc .\n(17)\nd\u03c4\nThe meaning of equations (14) and (17) is clear: the tetrad components of both vectors\nvary in the same way since their variation is due only to the rotation of the local Lorentz\nframe.\n7\n\n\fThere is a remarkable similarity between the discussed problem and the special case of\ng = 2 in electrodynamics. According to equations (7) and (6), the four-dimensional spin and\nfour-dimensional velocity of a charged particle with the gyromagnetic ratio g = 2 precess\nwith the same angular velocity:\ndSa\ne\n=\nFab S b ,\nd\u03c4\nm\n\ndua\ne\n=\nFab ub.\nd\u03c4\nm\n\nIn other words, the obvious correspondence takes place:\ne\nFab \u2190\u2192 \u03b3abc uc .\nm\n\n(18)\n\nIt allows us to derive the precession frequency \u03c9 of a three-dimensional vector of spin s in\nan external gravitational field from expression (8) by means of the simple substitution\ne\n1\nBi \u2212\u2192 \u2212 \u01ebikl \u03b3klc uc ;\nm\n2\n\ne\nEi \u2212\u2192 \u03b30ic uc\nm\n\n(19)\n\n(here again, it is just the velocity, a parameter of the local Lorentz group, that enters these\nrelations, but not the canonical momentum). Thus, the precession frequency is\n\u03c9i = \u01ebikl\n\nuk\nuc\n1\n.\n\u03b3klc + 0\n\u03b30lc\n2\nu +1\nu0w\n!\n\n(20)\n\nThe factor 1/u0w in expression (20) is due to the transition in the left-hand side of equation\n(14) to differentiating over the world time t:\nd\ndt d\nd\n=\n= u0w .\nd\u03c4\nd\u03c4 dt\ndt\nWe supply here u0w with the subscript w to indicate that this is the world, but not the tetrad,\ncomponent of 4-velocity. All other indices in (20) are tetrad ones, c = 0, 1, 2, 3, i, k, l =\n1, 2, 3.\nNaturally, the relativistic Hamiltonian for the interaction of the three-dimensional vector of spin with external gravitational field is exactly of the same form (9), as that in the\nelectromagnetic case. Here, of course, the precession frequency \u03c9 is given by formula (20).\nAs to the limits of applicability of the presented equations, which describe the spin precession in an external gravitational field, they are quite analogous to those pointed out in\nsubsection 2.1 for the case of an electromagnetic field.\nHowever, in some respect the spin interaction with a gravitational field differs essentially\nfrom that with an electromagnetic field. In the case of an electromagnetic field, the interaction\ndepends, generally speaking, on a free phenomenological parameter, g-factor. Moreover, if one\nallows for the violation of invariance both under the reflection of space coordinates and under\ntime reversal, one more parameter arises in the case of electromagnetic interaction, the value\nof the electric dipole moment of the particle. The point is that both magnetic and electric\ndipole moments interact with the electromagnetic field strength, so that this interaction is\n8\n\n\fgauge-invariant for any value of these moments. Only the spin-independent interaction with\nthe electromagnetic vector potential is fixed by the charge conservation and gauge invariance.\nOn the contrary, the Ricci rotation coefficients \u03b3abc entering the gravitational first-order\nspin interaction (14), as distinct from the Riemann tensor, are noncovariant. Therefore,\nthe discussed interaction of spin with gravitational field is fixed in unique way by the law\nof angular momentum conservation in flat space-time taken together with the equivalence\nprinciple, and thus it contains no free parameters [17].\nOn the other hand, it is no surprise that the precession frequency \u03c9 depends not on the\nRiemann tensor, but on the rotation coefficients. Of course, this frequency should not be a\ntensor: it is sufficient to recall that a spin, which is at rest in an inertial reference frame,\nprecesses in a rotating one.\n\n3.2\n\nSpin-Orbit Interaction. Weak Field\n\nOne can check easily that in the weak-field approximation where\ng\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd + h\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n|h\u03bc\u03bd | \u226a 1,\n\nthere is no difference between the tetrad and world indices in ea\u03bc , and the tetrad appears as\nfollows:\ne\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd + \u1ebd\u03bc\u03bd , |\u1ebd\u03bc\u03bd | \u226a 1.\nRelation between the tetrads and metric\nea\u03bc eb\u03bd \u03b7 ab = g\u03bc\u03bd\nin the weak-field approximation reduces to\n\u1ebd\u03bc\u03bd + \u1ebd\u03bd\u03bc = h\u03bc\u03bd .\nUnder the demand that tetrads are expressed via metric only, one arrives at the so-called\nsymmetric gauge for the tetrads where\n\u1ebd\u03bc\u03bd =\n\n1\nh\u03bc\u03bd .\n2\n\nThen in the weak-field approximation the Ricci coefficients are:\n\u03b3abc =\n\n1\n(hbc, a \u2212 hac, b ) .\n2\n\n(21)\n\nNow, with relations (20) and (21) one can solve, for instance, in an elementary way the\nproblem of the gravitational spin-orbit interaction for arbitrary particle velocities. In the\ncentrally symmetric field created by a mass M, the metric is\nh00 = \u2212\n\nrg\n2kM\n=\u2212\n,\nr\nr\n\nhmn = \u2212\n9\n\nrg\n2kM\n\u03b4mn = \u2212\n\u03b4mn .\nr\nr\n\n(22)\n\n\fHere the nonvanishing Ricci coefficients are\nkM\n(\u03b4jk ri \u2212 \u03b4ik rj ) ,\nr3\n\n\u03b3ijk =\n\n\u03b30i0 = \u2212\n\nkM\nri .\nr3\n\n(23)\n\nPlugging these expressions into formula (20) yields the following result for the precession\nfrequency:\n2\u03b3 + 1 kM\n\u03c9 ls =\nv \u00d7 r.\n(24)\n\u03b3 + 1 r3\nThe combination of a high velocity for a spinning particle with a weak gravitational field\nrefers obviously to a scattering problem. Another possible application is to a spinning particle\nbound by other forces, for instance, by electromagnetic ones, when we are looking for the\ncorrection to the precession frequency due to the gravitational interaction.\nIn the limit of low velocities, \u03b3 \u2192 1, formula (24) goes over into the classical result [18]\n\u03c9 ls =\nwith the gravitational spin-orbit potential\nUls (r) =\n\n3.3\n\n3 kM\nv \u00d7 r,\n2 r3\n\n(25)\n\n2\n\n3 kM\n[v \u00d7 r] s .\n2 r3\n\n(26)\n\nSpin-Orbit Interaction. Schwarzschild Field\n\nWe consider now the spin precession in the Schwarzschild field beyond the weak-field approximation (though neglecting the spin influence on the trajectory). The 3-dimensional\ncomponents of the Schwarzschild metric can be conveniently written as\ngmn\n\nrm rn\n= \u2212 \u03b4mn \u2212\nr2\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2212\n\nrm rn\n1\n1\n\u22a5\n= \u2212 \u03b4mn\n\u2212 nm nn\n.\n2\nr 1 \u2212 rg /r\n1 \u2212 rg /r\n\n(27)\n\nNonvanishing tetrads are chosen as follows:\n(0)\n\ne0 =\n\nq\n\n1 \u2212 rg /r;\n\n1\n\u22a5\n;\ne(k)\nm = \u03b4km + nk nm q\n1 \u2212 rg /r\n\n(28)\n\nin this subsection the tetrad indices are singled out by brackets.

Simple Example\n\nThe difficulty with the covariant description of spin-dependent forces arises already for the\nelectromagnetic interaction. To see what we are talking about, let us come back to Lagrangian (12). In the c\u22122 approximation it generates the spin-dependent force\ne(g \u2212 1)\neg\nsB,m +\nfm =\n2m\n2m\n\n!\n\nd\n[E \u00d7 s ],m \u2212 s[v \u00d7 E,m ] ,\ndt\n\n(32)\n\nacting on the particle (here and below in this subsection a subscript with a comma denotes\na partial derivative).\nLet us try to construct a covariant expression for the spin-dependent force acting on the\nparticle, which would reproduce in the same c\u22122 approximation force (32). Such covariant\ncorrection f \u03bc to the Lorentz force eF \u03bc\u03bd u\u03bd should be linear in the tensor of spin S\u03bc\u03bd and in\nthe gradient of the tensor of electromagnetic field F\u03bc\u03bd,\u03bb , it may depend also on the 4-velocity\nu\u03bc . Since u\u03bc u\u03bc = 1, this correction must satisfy the condition u\u03bc f \u03bc = 0. From the mentioned\ntensors one can construct only two independent structures meeting the last condition. The\nfirst one,\n\u03b7 \u03bc\u03ba F\u03bd\u03bb,\u03ba S \u03bd\u03bb \u2212 F\u03bb\u03bd,\u03ba u\u03ba S \u03bb\u03bd u\u03bc ,\n(33)\nreduces in the c\u22122 approximation to\n\n2s(B,m \u2212 [v \u00d7 E,m ]),\n11\n\n(34)\n\n\fand the second one,\nu\u03bbF\u03bb\u03bd,\u03ba u\u03ba S \u03bd\u03bc ,\n\n(35)\n\nreduces to\n\nd\n[s \u00d7 E],m .\n(36)\ndt\nLet us note that possible structures with the contraction F\u03bd\u03ba,\u03bbS \u03ba\u03bb reduce to (33) and (35),\ndue to the Maxwell equations and the antisymmetry of S\u03ba\u03bb .\nCertainly, no linear combination of (34) and (36) can reproduce the correct expression\n(32) for the spin-dependent force.\nBut why is it that the correct (in the c\u22122 approximation) formula (32) cannot be obtained\nfrom a covariant expression for the force? Obviously, one can easily reproduce by a linear\ncombination of (34) and (36) those terms in (32) which are proportional to g. In other words,\nthere is no problem to present in a covariant form the terms which describe, so to say, direct\ninteraction of a magnetic moment with external fields. It is the terms in (32) independent of\ng and corresponding to the Thomas precession, which cannot be written covariantly.\nOf course, the noncovariance of equations by itself does not mean that physical observables\nhave wrong transformation properties. It is sufficient to recall in this connection electrodynamics in the Coulomb gauge.\n\n4.2\n\nWhat Is the Coordinate of Spinning Particle?\n\nThe covariant formalism can be reconciled with the correct results if the coordinate x entering\nthe covariant equation is related to the usual one r in the c\u22122 approximation as follows:\nx = r+\n\n1\ns \u00d7 v.\n2m\n\n(37)\n\nThe generalization of this substitution to the case of arbitrary velocities is [5]\nx = r+\n\n\u03b3\ns \u00d7 v,\nm(\u03b3 + 1)\n\n\u03b3= \u221a\n\n1\n.\n1 \u2212 v2\n\n(38)\n\nObviously, after this velocity-dependent substitution, the Lagrangian depends explicitly on\nthe acceleration which in general results in spurious, nonphysical solutions.\nSince relations (37), (38) are valid for a free spinning particle as well, their origin can be\nelucidated with a simple example of a free particle of spin 1/2. Here, instead of the Dirac\nrepresentation with the Hamiltonian of the standard form\nH = \u03b1p + \u03b2 m ,\nit is convenient to use the Foldy-Wouthuysen (FW) representation. In it the Hamiltonian is\nHF W = \u03b2\u03b5p ,\n\n\u03b5p =\n\n12\n\nq\n\np2 + m2 ,\n\n\fand the 4-component wave functions \u03c8\u00b1 of the states of positive and negative energies reduce\nin fact to the 2-component spinors \u03c6\u00b1 :\n\u03c8+ =\n\n!\n\n\u03c6+\n,\n0\n\n\u03c8\u2212 =\n\n0\n\u03c6\u2212\n\n!\n\n.\n\nObviously, in this representation the operator of coordinate r\u0302 defined by the usual relation\nr\u0302\u03c8(r) = r\u03c8(r) ,\n\n(39)\n\nis just r.\nThe transition from the exact Dirac equation in an external field to its approximate\nform containing only the first-order correction in c\u22122 , is performed just by means of the FW\ntransformation. Thus, in the resulting c\u22122 Hamiltonian the coordinate of a spinning electron\nis the same r as in the completely nonrelativistic case 3 .\nOne more limiting case, which is of a special interest to us, is a classical spinning particle.\nSuch a particle is in fact a well-localized wave packet constructed from positive-energy states,\ni.e., it is naturally described in the FW representation. Therefore, it is just r which it is\nnatural to consider as the coordinate of a relativistic spinning particle.\nA certain subtlety here is that in the Dirac representation the operator r\u0302 is nondiagonal.\nHowever, the operator equations of motion certainly have the same form both in the Dirac\nand Foldy-Wouthuysen representations. Correspondingly, the semiclassical approximation to\nboth is the same. In particular, the time derivatives in the left-hand-side of classical equations\nof motion are taken of the same coordinate r, which serves as an argument of the fields in\nthe right-hand-side of these equations.\nAs to the covariant operator x\u0302, it has the simplest form in the Dirac representation:\nx\u0302D =\n\nr\n\n\u03b5\n\u03b5\n\u03b2rD\n,\nm\nm\nr\n\n(40)\n\nwhere r\u0302D is the operator acting on the wave function in the Dirac representation according\n\u2020\nto the rule (39). The covariance of the\nq matrix element \u03c8 x\u0302\u03c8 is obvious: the matrix \u03b2\ntransforms \u03c8 \u2020 into \u03c8\u0304, and the factors \u03b5/m are needed for the covariant normalization of\nthe wave functions.\nLet us rewrite the operator x\u0302 in the FW representation. The matrix U of the FW\ntransformation is\nm + \u03b5 \u2212 \u03b2\u03b1p\n.\n(41)\nU= q\n2\u03b5(m + \u03b5)\n\nThe calculation, which is conveniently performed in the momentum representation where\nrD = i\u2207p , results in the following expression:\nx\u0302F W\n\n!\n\n1\n1\n= U \u2020 x\u0302D U = \u03b2 r +\ns\u00d7p \u2212\n[(\u03b1p)r\u0302 + r\u0302(\u03b1p)].\nm(m + \u03b5)\n2m\n\n3\n\n(42)\n\nThis is why nobody makes substitution (37) in the Coulomb potential when treating the spin-orbit\ninteraction in the hydrogen atom.\n\n13\n\n\fHere\n\n1\ns=\n2\n\n\u03c3 0\n0 \u03c3\n\n!\n\n(43)\n\nis the relativistic operator of spin. Let us note that different components of the relativistic\ncoordinate operator (42) do not commute. If we confine to the space of the positive-energy\nstates, then we can put in (42) \u03b2 = 1 and drop the terms with \u03b1. In this way we arrive at\nexpression (38).\n\n4.3\n\nBack to Gravitational Interaction\n\nThus, there is however a serious problem with the covariant formulation of the equations of\nmotion of a spinning relativistic particle. This equation, for instance, in the gravitational\nfield,\n\u0012\n\u0013\nD\nDu\u03bd\n1\nmu\u03bc \u2212 S\u03bc\u03bd\n= \u2212 R\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 u\u03bd S \u03c1\u03c3 ,\n(44)\nD\u03c4\nD\u03c4\n2\ncontains the third time-derivative. As long as the term\nDu\u03bd\nD\nS\u03bc\u03bd\n,\n\u2212\nD\u03c4\nD\u03c4\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nwith the third time-derivative, is treated perturbatively, no special problem arises with it by\nitself. However, the inherent shortcoming of equation (44) (pointed out above for the corresponding electromagnetic equation in the c\u22122 approximation) is that beyond the perturbation\ntheory it evidently has spurious, nonphysical solutions.\nBut let us confine in (44) to the leading in spin approximation:\nDu\u03bc\n1\n=\u2212\nR\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 u\u03bd S \u03c1\u03c3 .\nD\u03c4\n2m\n\n(45)\n\nWe note that the right-hand-side of this equation is the only covariant structure possible here\n(up to a numerical factor). For the nonrelativistic motion in the gravitational field created\nby a mass M, equation (45) reduces to\n\u1e8d = \u2212\n\nkM\nkM\nx+3\n[v \u00d7 s \u2212 (nv)n \u00d7 s \u2212 2n(n[v \u00d7 s])] ,\n3\nx\nmx3\n\nn=\n\nx\n.\nx\n\n(46)\n\nHowever, the equation of motion that follows from the Lagrangian with potential (26) is\nsomewhat different:\nr\u0308 = \u2212\n\nkM\n3\nkM\n3\nv \u00d7 s \u2212 (nv)n \u00d7 s \u2212 n(n[v \u00d7 s]) ,\nr+3\n3\n3\nr\nmr\n2\n2\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\nn=\n\nr\n.\nr\n\n(47)\n\nThe reason of the disagreement between (47) and (46) is that they refer to the coordinates r\nand x defined differently (see (37)).\nThis discrepancy was pointed out long ago in [20] where the classical result (26) was\nderived from the scattering amplitude for the Dirac particle in the gravitational field.\n14\n\n\fQuite typical explanation of the discrepancy was: \"The quantum field theory of the spin1/2 particle from which the classical result was derived does not have any spin supplementary\ncondition (u\u03bc S\u03bc = 0 or u\u03bc S\u03bc\u03bd = 0). This is because field theories deal with point particles and\nnot with extended bodies.\" In fact, first of all, spin in the Dirac theory certainly satisfies the\nmentioned constraint (in the sense of expectation values). On the other hand, is the proton\nin a gravitational field a point particle or an extended body? The deuteron? The uranium\nnucleus? Obviously, an extended body can be treated as a point particle, as long as we do\nnot go into details of its structure and as long as we do not consider its internal excitations.\nThis point should be emphasized since up to now one may hear utterances similar to the\nabove one on \"point particles and extended bodies\", even from some well-known theorists.\n\nReferences\n[1] M.
