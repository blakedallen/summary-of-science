Sun: abundances \u2013 stars: abundances \u2013 stars: planetary systems\n\n1. Introduction\nThe lithium abundances of solar-like stars in the solar neighborhood spread over more than two orders of magnitude, which\nis much larger than the range of abundances seen for other elements (e.g., Reddy et al. 2003). The Sun, in particular, has a\nvery low lithium abundance compared to many nearby solar\nanalogs (e.g., Lambert & Reddy 2004). Furthermore, the photospheric solar lithium abundance is about 160 times lower\nthan that measured in meteorites (log \u01ebLi,\u2299 = 1.05 \u00b1 0.10 dex1 ,\nlog \u01ebLi,met = 3.26 \u00b1 0.05 dex; both values are from Asplund et al.\n2009). This difference between the current solar and protosolar\nvalues is not predicted by standard stellar evolution models (e.g.,\nD'Antona & Mazzitelli 1984).\nThe wide range of observed lithium abundances in\nnearby solar-like stars is most likely due to a dependency between log \u01ebLi and the star's age and mass (e.g.,\nMontalb\u00e1n & Schatzman 2000; Charbonnel & Talon 2005;\nXiong & Deng 2009; Do Nascimento et al. 2009). Lithium is\neasily destroyed by proton capture reactions in stellar interiors. Thus, if lithium is transported between the chemically\nmixed outer convection zone and deeper lying regions with\ntemperatures that are high enough for lithium destruction, the\nphotospheric abundance will decrease with time. Diffusion\nprobably contributes to the lowering of the surface lithium abundance throughout the main-sequence stage. This would explain\nwhy the photospheric solar abundance is much smaller than\nWe use the standard notation log \u01ebX = log nnXH + 12, where nX and nH\nare the the number densities of element X and hydrogen, respectively.\nAlso, for metallicities we use the common abbreviation [Fe/H]=\n\u2299\n.\nlog \u01ebFe \u2212 log \u01ebFe\n1\n\nthe meteoritic one. We expect an enhanced lithium depletion in\nstars with larger convection zones on the main sequence as well\nas in stars with a higher degree of differential rotation between\nthe radiative core and the convective envelope (see below). The\nreason is that lithium is only depleted as it moves to deeper\nand therefore hotter regions of a star, where the temperature is\nhigh enough (about 2.5 million K) for proton capture (see, e.g.,\nPinsonneault 1997).\nRecently, it has been suggested that the presence of planets around a star could affect the evolution of the photospheric\nlithium abundance (e.g., Bouvier 2008). A long-lasting star-disk\ninteraction during the star's pre-main sequence phase could slow\ndown the host-star's rotation and therefore increase the degree\nof differential rotation between the star's core and envelope.\nRotationally-driven mixing is then enhanced, thus destroying\nmore lithium than in stars without planets because fast rotators\nevolve with little core-envelope decoupling. Planet migration affects the star's angular momentum, which might also have an\nimpact on log \u01ebLi . Finally, the ingestion of a planet can increase\nthe surface lithium abundance (e.g., Montalb\u00e1n & Rebolo 2002;\nIsraelian et al. 2001).\nThe possibility of a lithium-planet connection is subject\nof ongoing discussions. Recent work by Gonzalez (2008),\nGonzalez et al. (2010), Castro et al. (2008), and Israelian et al.\n(2009) suggests a possible log \u01ebLi -planet dependency, whereas\nRyan (2000) and Luck & Heiter (2006) find that stars with planets show the same lithium distribution as the comparison field\nstars. Takeda et al. (2007, 2010) describe the stellar angular momentum as the crucial factor that determines the lithium abundance of solar-like stars and find that slow rotators show an enhanced lithium depletion. Planets could be the reason for a slow\n\n\f2\n\nP. Baumann et al.: Lithium depletion in solar-like stars\n\nrotation, but they were not able to draw firm conclusions due to\nthe low number of planet hosts in their sample and the fact that\ntheir use of the star's projected rotational velocity, v sin i, instead\nof measured rotation periods introduces additional uncertainty,\nsince the inclination angle i is unknown.\nFrom a practical point of view, an enhanced lithium depletion in planet-hosts would be greatly beneficial for the search\nfor extrasolar planets, because all known methods for extrasolar\nplanet detection (e.g., radial velocity, transits, or microlensing)\nare very time consuming. With an enhanced lithium depletion,\nhowever, one could preselect planet-host candidates just by\nobtaining the stars' chemical composition.\nIn this paper, we derive lithium abundances and ages for a\nsample of solar-type stars to examine whether there is a correlation between lithium and age as well as a possible connection between lithium and planets. We also examine lithium abundances\nand ages for the solar analog sample of Israelian et al. (2009),\nwho claim to have found evidence for an enhanced lithium depletion in planet-host stars.\n\n2. Observations & analysis\nOur sample consists of 117 solar-like stars selected\nfrom the Hipparcos catalog (Perryman et al. 1997) as in\nMel\u00e9ndez & Ram\u0131\u0301rez (2007). They where observed at the\nMcDonald (Robert G. Tull coud\u00e9 spectrograph on the 2.7m\nHarlan J. Smith telescope; RGT), Las Campanas (MIKE\nspectrograph on the 6.5m Magellan Clay telescope), and La\nSilla (HARPS spectrograph on the 3.6m ESO telescope) observatories. Our few solar twins observed at Keck (Mel\u00e9ndez et al.\n2006) are not discussed here since they are already included in\nthe McDonald sample.\nThe RGT and MIKE data (spectra as well as stellar parameters) are from Ram\u0131\u0301rez et al. (2009, hereafter R09) and\nMel\u00e9ndez et al. (2009, 2010, hereafter M09), respectively; two\nstars (HIP10215 and HIP79672) are part of both samples.\nHARPS spectra for 12 more stars were obtained from the ESO\narchive, while spectra for 6 other stars were obtained from the\nS4 N database (Allende Prieto et al. 2004)2 . One of the objects\n(HIP80337) occurs in both the HARPS and the S4 N samples\n(we use the HARPS parameters, because they have the smaller\nuncertainties), so that we have 17 additional stars. The spectra\nfor these stars were analyzed in an identical fashion as in R09\n(see below). All sub-samples contain one or more solar reference objects for normalization: R09 used the light reflected from\nthe asteroids Ceres and Vesta, M09 used Vesta, and for the stars\nadded in this work, spectra of asteroid Ceres, Jupiter's moon\nGanymedes, and the Moon were used. Table 1 shows the specifications of each sub-sample, where the last two lines describe the\nadditional data from this work. All spectra have a signal-to-noise\nratio (S/N) greater than about 200, which allows the determination of lithium abundances as low as solar. Note that three stars\nin our sample are also included in M09 (HIP79672) and R09\n(HIP14614 and HIP42438). For the further analysis, we use the\nparameters with the smaller uncertainties.\nThe HARPS and S4 N data were analyzed by first measuring Fe i and Fe ii equivalent widths (EWs), where a line list of\n45 iron lines (34 Fe i and 11 Fe ii lines) within the wavelength\nrange from 4445 to 8294 \u00c5 was used. The Fe lines have a broad\n2\n\nThe Spectroscopic Survey of Stars in the Solar Neighbourhood\n(S4 N) data and more detailed information can be found at\nhttp://hebe.as.utexas.edu/s4n/\n\nTable 1.

The\nline list adopted is from Scott et al. (in preparation, see also\nAsplund et al. 2009). To calculate the iron abundances ([Fe/H])\nfrom the Fe i/Fe ii lines, we used the spectrum synthesis program\nMOOG (Sneden 1973) and ATLAS 9 model atmospheres without convective overshoot (e.g., Kurucz 1993). We iteratively assigned the stellar parameters effective temperature, surface gravity, and microturbulent velocity by forcing simultaneously Fe i\nexcitation equilibrium and Fe i/Fe ii ionization equilibrium. For\na more detailed description see Ram\u0131\u0301rez et al. (2009). With the\nmethod described above, we derived the following mean errors:\n\u03c3(Teff ) = 40 K, \u03c3(log g) = 0.06 dex, and \u03c3([Fe/H]) = 0.025\ndex.\nStellar ages and masses were determined primarily from the\nlocation of stars on the theoretical HR-diagram (T eff vs. log g)\nas compared to theoretical predictions based on stellar evolution\ncalculations (isochrones). We produced a grid of Y2 isochrones\n(e.g., Yi et al. 2001) with steps of 0.01 dex in metallicity around\nthe solar value. For each star, we computed the age probability distribution of all isochrone points included within a 3-\u03c3 radius from the observed stellar parameters. The adopted mean\nage and 1-\u03c3 Gaussian-like upper and lower limits were derived\nfrom the age probability distribution (e.g., Lachaume et al. 1999;\nReddy et al. 2003). Although isochrone ages of unevolved stars\nare typically unreliable, the high precision of our stellar parameters allowed us to infer reasonably accurate absolute isochrone\nages, even for stars as young as \u223c 3 Gyr; relative ages are\nnaturally even better determined. For most stars younger than\nabout 3 Gyr only upper limits could be determined. For these\nyounger stars, we adopted ages based on measurements of rotational periods (Gaidos et al. 2000; Barnes 2007) and X-ray luminosity (Ag\u00fceros et al. 2009) along with the rotation-age relation by Barnes (2007) and the X-ray luminosity-age relation by\nGuinan & Engle (2009). In a few cases of stars in the intermediate age region (2 \u2212 4 Gyr), an average of isochrone and rotational\nages was determined to improve the age estimate. For stars with\nvery unreliable isochrone ages we used the activity-based ages\nby Mamajek & Hillenbrand (2008) and Saffe et al. (2005). Our\nadopted ages and the methods to obtain them are listed in Table\n5.\nUsing our stellar parameters as well as those in R09 and\nM09, we derived the lithium abundances for all 117 stars with\nline synthesis using MOOG. For this purpose we generated a line\nlist from 6697 to 6717 \u00c5, i.e. 10 \u00c5 around the lithium doublet\nat 6707.8 \u00c5. The whole wavelength range was synthesized with\nMOOG, where hyperfine splitting and the Li-doublet were taken\ninto account. Knowing the basic stellar parameters, we were able\nto fit the lithium line including the effects of the projected rotational velocity v sin i and the microturbulent and macroturbulent\nvelocities. We derived lithium abundances with a mean error of\n\u03c3 = 0.05 dex for stars in which the lithium doublet was detected.\nOur mean of all solar spectra is log \u01ebLi = 1.03 \u00b1 0.04 dex.\n\n\fP.

(2008)\n\nInitially, we derived Li abundances assuming line formation\nin LTE (local thermal equilibrium), in 1D, hydrostatic, plane parallel ATLAS 9 model atmospheres. Abundance corrections were\nthereafter applied to account for departures from LTE in the formation of the Li resonance line. The non-LTE modeling procedure is the same as described in Lind et al. (2009), but extended\nto cover also super-solar metallicities. For our sample stars, the\nabundance corrections range from -0.03 dex to +0.08 dex, depending on the lithium line strength and exact stellar parameters. In stars for which the equivalent width of the lithium line\nis below \u223c 100 m\u00c5, over-ionization of neutral lithium results\nin positive abundances corrections, increasing with increasing\nmetallicity and decreasing effective temperature. When the line\nstarts to become saturated, increased photon losses pushes the\nstatistical equilibrium in the opposite direction, i.e. into overrecombination, resulting in negative corrections for some stars\n(see Lind et al. 2009, for more details). The non-LTE corrections\nare very small in comparison to the full range covered in lithium\nabundance, and hence the qualitative results of this study are the\nsame for lithium abundances inferred in LTE and non-LTE. Note\nthat the NLTE corrections are computed using MARCS models (Gustafsson et al. 2008). Our NLTE corrected solar lithium\nabundance is 1.07 \u00b1 0.04, in good agreement with the 3D-NLTE\nestimate by Asplund et al. (2009).\n\nOur adopted stellar parameters and derived LTE and nonLTE lithium abundances are given in Table 5. Fig. 1 shows the\ngood agreement between the three observational sub-samples,\nwhich reduces errors introduced by inhomogeneous data processing and therefore makes the analysis more reliable. It also\nis a proof of the consistently good quality of the data.\n\nWe have also considered the lithium abundances of solar twins from 8 open clusters as listed in Table 2. Data are\nfrom the compilation by Sestito & Randich (2005) as shown in\nTable 2 with updated data for M67 by Pasquini et al. (2008).\nThe age for M67 is taken from VandenBerg et al. (2007) and\nYadav et al. (2008), the lithium abundances for M67 stars are\nfrom Castro et al. (2010). The clusters IC2602 and IC2391 are\nlisted as one here, because their parameters are basically the\nsame. We only used open clusters around solar metallicity (0.0 \u00b1\n0.1 dex) and with reliable data. The solar twins that we select in\nopen clusters are stars of one solar mass by definition, i.e. they\nare main sequence stars with 1M\u2299 based on their effective temperature. We take into account the increase of the solar effective\ntemperature with increasing age in the selection of stars from\nopen clusters.\n\nFig. 1. NLTE lithium abundance, log g, and metallicity plotted\nagainst effective temperature. R09 and M09 stand for data from\nRam\u0131\u0301rez et al. (2009)and Mel\u00e9ndez et al. (2009, 2010), respectively; TW is data re-analyzed in this work.\n\n3. Results\n3.1. Lithium and age\n\nUsing our sample of solar-like stars a clear lithium-age trend is\nobserved (Fig. 2). The dependency is as expected: older stars\nshow more lithium depletion. The Spearman correlation coeffi-\n\n\f4\n\nP.

The Sun is marked\nwith \u2299.\ncient is rtot = \u22120.61. This trend becomes clearer when we restrict\nthe sample to solar twins, as in Fig. 3. We define solar twins as\nstars with [Fe/H] = 0.0 \u00b1 0.1 and M = (1.00 \u00b1 0.04)M\u2299 The stars\nfrom the open clusters given in Table 2 fit the trend in Fig. 3 very\nwell. This is very important, because the ages of these clusters\nare well determined and the fact that they lie in the midst of the\nlithium vs. age trend of the field solar twins suggests that the\nages we derived for individual stars are reliable. The Spearman\ncorrelation coefficient for the solar twin log \u01ebLi -age trend including the open cluster data is rtwin = \u22120.75. Another interesting\nthing to point out here is the fact that the Sun (marked with \u2299 in\nthe figures) fits the trend very well. This leads to the conclusion\nthat the Sun does not have a particularly low lithium abundance\ncompared to stars of similar age, mass, and metallicity.\nFig. 3 also compares our observational data with model predictions from Charbonnel & Talon (2005) for different initial rotational velocities of the stars. These hydrodynamical models\ngive predictions for the evolution of surface Li abundance in\nsolar-type stars, accounting self-consistently for element segregation and transport of angular momentum by rotation, gravity\nwaves, and meridional circulation. They agree not only with the\ngeneral lithium depletion trend observed by us, but it could also\nexplain the relatively large scatter as a result of differences in\ninitial stellar rotational velocities.\n3.2. Lithium and planets\n\nIn Fig. 4 we plot lithium abundance against age, this time\nfor a sample of metal-rich solar analogs. As metal-rich solar\nanalogs we define stars with [Fe/H] = 0.25 \u00b1 0.15 and M\n= (1.08\u00b10.08)M\u2299. We use those criteria because our sub-sample\n\nFig. 3. log \u01ebLi vs. age for solar twins from R09, M09, TW and\nfrom the solar twins in solar metallicity open clusters. Note the\ndifferent scale compared to Fig. 2. The solid lines are the predicted values from the models by Charbonnel & Talon (2005)\nfor different initial rotational velocities.\nof planet-hosts is biased towards those higher metallicities and\nmasses. In this case we make a distinction between stars that\nare known to host planets (filled symbols) and those for which\nplanets have not yet been detected (open symbols).\nWe used a two-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test\nto measure the probability that the samples of metal-rich solar\nanalogs with and without planets in Fig. 4 belong to the same\nparent population. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, we took into\naccount the errors in lithium abundance and age by choosing\nrandom, normally distributed values within each variable's 1\u03c3 environment on the linear scale, which means that instead of\nlog \u01ebLi , we used 10log \u01ebLi \u221212 , that is nnLiH . The upper limits were accounted for by distributing the values uniformly between 0 and\nthe upper limit.\nWe averaged the outcome of 1, 000 KS tests. This gave a\nprobability for our metal-rich solar analogs with planets and\nthose without planets to be part of the same parent sample of\n64 \u00b1 15%; if we ignore the error bars and upper limits, this probability goes up to 80%. This is very important for the further\nanalysis of the data, because it tells us that there is no intrinsic difference between the two sub-samples. It is highly unlikely\nthat the planet-hosts and comparison stars are different regarding\ntheir surface lithium abundance.\nThe age-lithium correlation coefficient for the solar twins\nis similar to that corresponding to the metal-rich solar analogs\n(rtwin = \u22120.75, ranalog = \u22120.71). However, the shapes of those\ntrends are not identical. In the range from 3 to 6 Gyr, in particular, it is clear that for a given age, metal-rich solar analogs have\non average lower lithium abundances than solar twins (see also\n\n\fP. Baumann et al.: Lithium depletion in solar-like stars\n\n5\n\nFig. 4. Same as Fig. 3 but for metal-rich solar analogs ([Fe/H]=\n0.25 \u00b1 0.15, M= 1.08 \u00b1 0.08 M\u2299).\nFig. 5 (c)). This is independent of whether the star has a planet\nor not. The age-lithium trend in Sun-like stars is thus metallicity dependent. This metallicity effect is predicted by stellar\nmodels due to the deeper convection zone in more metal-rich\nstars (Castro et al. 2009) and has lately been confirmed (see, e.g.\ndo Nascimento et al. 2010, Fig. 5). Note, however, that the mass\nranges being compared are somewhat different, and that this will\nhave an impact on the lithium evolution of those two samples.\n\n4. Discussion\nRecently, it was claimed that planet-harboring solar-type stars\nshow an enhanced lithium depletion and that lithium surface\nabundances in Sun-like stars do not correlate with stellar ages\n(Israelian et al. 2009; Sousa et al. 2010, hereafter I09 and S10,\nrespectively).\nIn Fig. 5, we plot age versus lithium abundance for all 82\nstars used in I09 along with the objects from this work (hereafter B103 ). With the stellar parameters adopted by I09 we derived the ages for that sample using the same techniques as for\nour sample; the ages we derive for the I09 sample are given\nin Table 5. Fig. 5 shows the results for all stars panel (a), the\nsolar twins (panel (b)), and the metal-rich solar analogs (panel\n(c)). We are using the same selection criteria for solar twins and\nmetal-rich solar analogs as in Sect. 3. The agreement between\nthe age-lithium relation found with our sample and that by I09 is\nexcellent, in particular when looking at the solar twin plot. This\nshows that the stellar parameters used by I09 (which were derived by Sousa et al. 2008) are essentially on the same scale as\n3\n\nFor consistency, we used our LTE lithium abundance in this discussion because the I09 work does not take into account non-LTE corrections.\n\nFig. 5. Comparison between the sample from Israelian et al.\n(2009, I09) and our sample (B10). The solid line, identically\ndrawn in each panel, is an arbitrary reference line to guide the\neye to the different log \u01ebLi levels in solar twins an metal-rich solar\nanalogs. Note that for consistency we use the LTE log \u01ebLi values\nhere.\n\nours and therefore the combination of both samples for this analysis does not introduce systematic errors. In fact, for the 10 stars\nin common between our sample and I09 we find differences of\n3 \u00b1 20 K in Teff , 0.02 \u00b1 0.04 in log g, 0.003 \u00b1 0.023 in [Fe/H], and\n0.06 \u00b1 0.11 in log \u01ebLi (the latter for the only 3 stars with lithium\ndoublet detection).\nIn Fig. 5(a), ten stars with ages greater than 4 Gyr and\nhigher than average log \u01ebLi can be seen above the main locus.\nTaking a closer look at those \"outliers\", the most interesting fact\nis that they have a particularly low surface gravity (log g \u2243 4.1)\ncompared to the rest of stars. In Fig. 6, we show log \u01ebLi vs log g.\nThe surface lithium abundance on the low-log g side does not\nfollow the main track, for which log \u01ebLi decreases with lower\nsurface gravity, which is essentially the age effect, given that\nall these stars have similar masses. To exclude the possibility\nof systematic errors in the analysis of the low log g outliers,\nwe compared the parameters and in particular their ages with\n\n\f6\n\nP. Baumann et al.: Lithium depletion in solar-like stars\n\nFig. 6. log \u01ebLi vs. log g for the stars from our sample (B10) and\nI09.\nvarious sources (see Table 3). Our derived ages for these outliers\nare in reasonably good agreement with respect to the the values\ngiven in the literature. Only two stars appear to be older than the\nages given in the consulted references, but even that difference\nis only around 2 Gyr and therefore not big enough for these stars\nto cease being outliers. This leads us to the conclusion that the\nages we derived for the I09 sample and the stellar parameters\nadopted by I09 (mostly derived by Sousa et al. 2008) are correct\nand the high-lithium envelope in the lithium-age plane is most\nlikely real. Thus, when restricted to a narrow range of Teff\naround the solar value, log g \u2243 4.1 stars have higher lithium\nabundances than less evolved stars of similar age.\nWe have examined the results by S10, who claim that\nthere is no correlation between lithium and age in the I09\nsample. The S10 sample is basically the same as in I09, but\nreduced to the 60 stars studied in Sousa et al. (2008) because\nof the high homogeneity of the stellar parameters. We show\ntheir lithium-age trends in Fig. 7. The selection criteria we\nused for the solar twins and the metal-rich solar analogs are\nthe same as in Fig. 5. However, this time we are using the\nmasses and ages determined by S10. Although their full sample\nappears to show no correlation (Fig. 7a), the solar twin sample\nshows a clear trend between lithium and age. Note that the\none planet-host in this sample has a low lithium abundance\nbecause of its old age and not the fact that it hosts a planet.\nThere is no clear correlation between lithium and age for the\nmetal-rich solar analog sample in this case, but this could be\ndue to uncertain ages. Since the solar twin sample includes only\n6 stars, we define another sample of \"extended solar twins\"\nwith [Fe/H] = 0.0 \u00b1 0.1 and M = 1.00 \u00b1 0.10M\u2299 . The resulting\nfigure shows a very definite trend of log \u01ebLi with age and only\na single outlier appears. This outlier (HD215456), however,\nshows a relatively low log g of 4.10 (and an almost solar mass\nof 1.04M\u2299).\nWe have also examined the lithium vs. effective temperature\ndiagram presented by I09. As shown in Fig. 8 (a), they found that\nalmost all stars with a high lithium abundance (log \u01ebLi &1.5 dex)\nhave not been shown to be planet hosts yet, whereas planet hosts\nand objects where no planets have been found are distributed\nquite equally below that lithium abundance, although the high\nnumber of upper limits makes a direct comparison difficult. In\n\nFig. 7. log \u01ebLi vs. age for the S10 sample. The selection criteria\nfor the four panels are given in the text. Masses and ages adopted\nto make this figure are from S10.\n\norder to make a more robust comparison, we have restricted the\ncomparison sample using the following criteria: we only considered comparison objects within a 2\u03c3 range in [Fe/H], logg,\nand Teff around planet hosts, where \u03c3 are the average values of\nthe uncertainties in the stellar parameters given by Sousa et al.\n(2008). In this way, we make sure that all stars lie within the\nsame region of parameter space and are not influenced by the\nage or metallicity effects we find. Note that we do not restrict\nthe lithium range, only metallicity, surface gravity and effective\ntemperature. Using this selection allows for a homogeneous and\nunbiased comparison. When we restrict the parameter range covered by the comparison stars as described above, the lithiumplanet connection disappears; as seen in Fig. 8 (b), it is not possible to conclude on stronger lithium depletion in planet hosts\ncompared to other stars. We stress that this figure is plotted directly from the I09 data without further manipulation or use of\nnew parameters.\nThree systematic biases have led I09 and S10 to conclude\nthat solar-type planet-hosts feature an enhanced lithium depletion and that there is no age dependence:\n1. At [Fe/H] \u2243 0.0, the existing HARPS sample of solar analogs\nwith planets are on average older and therefore more depleted in lithium than non-planet-hosts, but not because they\nhave planets.\n\n\fP. Baumann et al.: Lithium depletion in solar-like stars\n\n7\n\nidentical. Thus, the presence of a planet does not influence\nthe observed surface lithium abundance.\n4. A number of solar-like stars with unusually high lithium\nabundance for their age are present in the field. We note that\nall of them have relatively low log g \u2243 4.1. We intend to\npursue further observational work to better understand this\nsmall group of relatively low surface gravity and peculiarly\nhigh lithium abundance.\nAcknowledgements. We thank G. Israelian for sending us the lithium abundance\ndata from I09.\n\nReferences\n\nFig. 8. Lithium abundance as a function of T eff in stars with and\nwithout detected planets from the I09 sample. Filled and open\ncircles represent stars with and without detected planets, respectively. In the upper panel the original comparison made is shown,\nwhich is not appropriate because the sample being compared\nspan different ranges in evolutionary phases and metallicities.\nA less biased comparison is shown in the bottom panel, where\nwe only plot stars without detected planets with stellar parameters (T eff , log g, [Fe/H]) within 2\u03c3 of the planet-hosting stars.\nWhen a proper comparison is made, i.e., using stars with similar\nfundamental parameters, lithium is not abnormally low in stars\nwith detected giant planets.\n2. At higher [Fe/H], where most of the I09 planet-hosts concentrate, there is a slightly different log \u01ebLi vs. age trend such\nthat, at a given age in the 3 \u2212 6 Gyr range, metal-rich solar\nanalogs are more lithium-poor compared to solar metallicity\nones. This is true for both planet-hosts as well as single stars.\n3. I09 and S10 samples include a number of peculiarly high\nlithium abundance and relatively low log g (\u2243 4.1) stars; only\none of them is a planet host.\nThe apparently lower lithium abundances of planet-hosts found\nby I09 can thus be fully explained by a combination of age and\nmetallicity effects, not separately but through the age vs. lithium\nrelation.\n\n5. Conclusions\n1. In stars of solar mass and solar metallicity, it is clear that\nolder stars have experienced more surface lithium depletion.\nBoth the overall lithium-age trend as well as the scatter that\nwe observe in this sample of stars can be explained by the\ntheoretical models by Charbonnel & Talon (2005).\n2. Metal-rich ([Fe/H]\u223c 0.25) solar analogs (M\u223c 1.08M\u2299) also\nexhibit a lithium-age trend, which is different from that seen\nin 1M\u2299 , [Fe/H]= 0.0 stars. At any given age in the 3 to 6 Gyr\nrange, the metal-rich solar analogs are more lithium-poor.\nThis is true for both planet-hosts and single stars.\n3.
