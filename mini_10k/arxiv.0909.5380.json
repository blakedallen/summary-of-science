Introduction\nMany of the stationary and non-stationary properties of a trapped Bose-Einstein\ncondensate (BEC) (or a Bose superfluid) can be satisfactorily explained by the meanfield Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation [1]. However, there is no such mean-field equation\nin configuration space for the Fermi superfluid even after the experimental realization\nof the crossover from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) limit through unitarity to\nthe Bose limit in a trapped Fermi superfluid [2, 3, 4, 5].\nTo study the properties of stationary and non-stationary states of a trapped Fermi\nsuperfluid with equal number of paired spin-up and -down fermions, Adhikari and\nSalashnich developed a Galilei-invariant nonlinear density functional (DF) equation valid\nfrom the weak-coupling BCS limit to unitarity [6, 7]. The solution of the DF equation\nof [6] yielded results for energy of a trapped Fermi superfluid in close agreement with\nthose obtained from Monte Carlo calculations [8] not only in the BCS and unitarity\nlimits but also along the BCS-unitarity crossover [2].\nIn actual experiments, an axially symmetric [1, 3, 9], rather than a spherical, trap\nis usually employed for the confinement of the BEC or Fermi superfluid. In many\nsituations of actual interest, the trap has an extreme geometry [9], e.g., very strong\nradial or axial confinement. Consequently, the superfluid is formed in the shape of a\ncigar or a disk and the solution of the nonlinear equation in such cases deserves special\nattention. The cigar-shaped BEC or Fermi superfluid is quasi one dimensional (1D) and\nthe reduction of the full three-dimensional (3D) equation to accurate 1D form would\nbe of advantage. Similarly, it would be beneficial to reduce the full 3D equation to 2D\nform for the description of a disk-shaped BEC and Fermi superfluid.\nWe propose a simple scheme for the 3D-1D and 3D-2D reduction of the GP equation\nfor a BEC and the DF equation for a Fermi superfluid at the BCS and unitarity\nlimits. The 3D-1D reduction for a cigar-shaped BEC or a Fermi superfluid is done\nin the adiabatic approximation which assumes the essential dynamics to be confined in\nthe axial direction with the radial degrees of freedom adjusting instantaneously to the\nminimum energy equilibrium configuration compatible with the axial dynamics [10, 11].\nUnder this approximation the 3D wave function factorizes into an explicitly timedependent axial and time-independent radial parts which allows for a formal reduction\nof the original time-dependent 3D nonlinear equation into a time-dependent 1D and\nan auxiliary time-independent 2D equations. The same is also true for a disk-shaped\nBEC or a Fermi superfluid with the role of time-dependent 1D and auxiliary timeindependent 2D equations interchanged, e.g., the time-dependent equation is now 2D\nand the auxiliary equation 1D in nature.\nFirst we illustrate the present scheme through an application to a BEC described\nby the GP equation, where there are already several schemes [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,\n17, 18, 19] for 3D-1D and 3D-2D reductions. Among these, the reduction schemes of\nSalasnich et al. (SPR) [10, 12] and Mu\u00f1oz Mateo et al. (MMD) [11, 13] are the simplest\nto implement and have been shown to be the most efficient [11]. We compare the present\n\n\fMean-field equations for cigar- and disk-shaped Bose and Fermi superfluids\n\n3\n\nscheme with those of SPR [10, 12] and MMD [11, 13] for a BEC. Recently, Adhikari and\nSalasnich (AS) [20] suggested one scheme for such 3D-1D and 3D-2D reductions of the\n3D DF equation for a Fermi superfluid at the BCS and unitarity limits. We apply our\nscheme to a Fermi superfluid and obtain distinct 3D-1D and 3D-2D reductions.\nIn section 2 we illustrate the 3D-1D and 3D-2D reduction schemes in the case\nof the GP equation for a BEC. In section 3 we consider the reduction schemes for the\nnonlinear DF equation of a Fermi superfluid at unitarity and BCS limits. In this case we\nreduce the 3D DF equation to 1D (for cigar-shaped superfluid) and 2D (for disk-shaped\nsuperfluid) forms with analytic nonlinear terms. We show that the reduced 1D and 2D\nequations for cigar- and disk-shaped Fermi superfluids are very effective for describing\nthe stationary states and non-stationary breathing oscillation and free expansion of the\nFermi superfluid at unitarity in close agreement with the solution of the full 3D DF\nequation. Finally, in section 4 we give a summary and some concluding remarks.\n2. 3D-1D and 3D-2D Reductions of the GP equation\nWe first apply our approach to a BEC described by the GP equation. The GP equation\nfor N bosons of mass m is written as [1]\n\"\n\n4\u03c0h\u03042 \u00e2N\nh\u03042 \u22072r\u0302\n\u2202\n+ V (r\u0302) +\n|\u03a8(r)|2 \u03a8(r\u0302, t) = 0,\n\u2212ih\u0304 \u2212\n2m\nm\n\u2202 t\u0302\n#\n\n(1)\n\nwith \u00e2 the atomic scattering length, normalization |\u03a8|2 d3 r\u0302 = 1, V (r\u0302) = m\u03c9 2 (\u03c1\u03022 +\n\u03bb2 \u1e91 2 )/2 the harmonic trapping potential with frequencies \u03c9 and \u03bb\u03c9 in radial (\u03c1\u0302) and\naxial (\u1e91) directions (r\u0302 \u2261 \u03c1\u0302, \u1e91). Employing dimensionless harmonic\noscillator units\nq\n3/2\nt = t\u0302\u03c9, r = r\u0302/a\u03c1 , z = \u1e91/a\u03c1 , \u03c1 = \u03c1\u0302/a\u03c1 , a = \u00e2/a\u03c1 , \u03c8 = \u03a8a\u03c1 , a\u03c1 = h\u0304/m\u03c9, (1) can be\nwritten as\n#\n\"\n\u22072r \u03c12 + \u03bb2 z 2\n\u2202\n2\n(2)\n+\n+ 4\u03c0aN|\u03c8| \u03c8(r, t) = 0,\n\u2212i \u2212\n\u2202t\n2\n2\nR\n\nwith normalization |\u03c8|2 d3 r = 1.\nIn the limits of very small (cigar-shaped trap) and very large (disk-shaped trap)\n\u03bb, the length scales in the axial and radial directions are very different. Consequently,\nthe correlations between these two directions can be neglected and the condensate wave\nfunction could be factorized in variables \u03c1 and z [10, 11]. In the case of cigar-shaped\ntraps the dynamics takes place in the axial direction. The opposite happens in case of\na disk-shaped trap. For a stationary solution \u03c8(r) of (2) in a cigar-shaped trap one can\nR\ndefine a linear density \u03c62 (z) \u2261 d2 \u03c1\u03c8 2 (r). Similarly, for a disk-shaped trap one can\nR\ndefine a radial density \u03c62 (\u03c1) \u2261 dz\u03c8 2 (r).\nR\n\n2.1. 3D-1D reduction for a cigar-shaped BEC\nFor a cigar-shaped trap, the above consideration leads to the factorization [11]\n\u03c8(r, t) = \u03c6(\u03c1, n1 (z, t))\u03c6(z, t),\n\n(3)\n\n\fMean-field equations for cigar- and disk-shaped Bose and Fermi superfluids\n\n4\n\nwhere linear density n1 is defined as n1 (z, t) \u2261 N|\u03c6(z, t)|2 = N d2 \u03c1|\u03c8|2 and\nR\nR\nnormalizations d2 \u03c1|\u03c6(\u03c1, n1 )|2 = dz|\u03c6(z, t)|2 = 1. We assume that the function\n\u03c6(\u03c1, n1 (z, t)) has no explicit t or z dependence and hence these derivatives do not act on\nthis function. This is a good approximation, in general, as we find in numerical studies.\nThe substitution of (3) in (2) then leads to\nR\n\n#\n\n\"\n\n1 2 1 2\n1 \u22022\n1 2 2\n\u2202\n\u03c6(z,\nt)=\n\u03c6(z,\nt)\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u03bb\nz\n\u2207 + \u03c1 + 4\u03c0an1 |\u03c6|2 \u03c6(\u03c1, n1 ).

In the small N weak-coupling limit, the wave function can be approximated by\nthe following normalized Gaussian form [21]\n\u221a\n(8)\n\u03c6(\u03c1, n1 ) = exp[\u2212\u03c12 /(2\u03b12)]/( \u03b12 \u03c0),\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the width.

The\nnormalization condition of the TF wave function leads to [10, 11]\n\u221a\n\u03bc\u03c1 (n1 ) = 4an1 .\n(10)\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nWe suggest the following simple interpolation formula for \u03bc\u03c1 (n1 ) valid for small to\nlarge an1 incorporating the limiting values (9) and (10)\n\u03b12 q 4\n1\n(11)\n\u2212\n+ \u03b1 + 4an1\n2\u03b12\n2\nto be used in (5), where \u03b1 is taken as a fixed constant for all n1 . In the weak-coupling\nan1 \u2192 0 limit, (7) reduces to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for a 2D harmonic oscillator with\nthe exact solution (8) with \u03b1 = 1. Then (11) is a good approximation to (6) for \u03b1 = 1.\nFor slightly larger values of an1 (11) continues to be a good approximation to (6), but\nwith a slightly smaller value of \u03b1. Motivated by this, we take a slightly smaller value\nof \u03b1 in (11).

The results are shown in table 4 for different a2z n2 along\nwith those from the AS scheme [20].\nNow to see how well the effective 2D equations (37) and (44) reproduce the radial\ndensity \u03c62 (\u03c1) of a disk-shaped Fermi superfluid we plot in figure 1 (b) the 2D density\ncalculated from (37) and (44) and the same calculated from the full 3D (29) for \u03bb = 4\nand N = 2, 10, 100. The excellent agreement between the two sets of results for \u03bb as\nsmall as 4 demonstrates the usefulness of the present 2D model equations.\n3.3. Dynamics: Breathing oscillation\nNow we subject the reduced 1D and 2D DF equations to a more stringent test, e.g.,\nhow well these equations can reproduce non-stationary (non-equilibrium) dynamics of\na cigar- and disk-shaped Fermi superfluid. First we consider a cigar-shaped Fermi\nsuperfluid with \u03bb = 0.25, which is set into breathing oscillation by reducing only the axial\npotential suddenly by a factor of 0.9. The radial trap is left unchanged. The resultant\noscillation is studied using the full 3D DF equation (29) as well as the reduced 1D DF\nequation (30) using the chemical potential (35). The root mean square (rms) axial size\nas calculated from the 3D and 1D equations are plotted in figure 2 (a). Next we consider\na disk-shaped Fermi superfluid with \u03bb = 4, which is set into breathing oscillation by\nreducing only the radial potential suddenly by a factor of 0.9. The resultant oscillation\nis studied using the full 3D DF equation (29) as well as the reduced 2D DF equation\n(37) using the chemical potential (44).

Dynamics: Free expansion\nNow we consider the problem of free expansion of a cigar- and disk-shaped Fermi\nsuperfluid, respectively, when the axial and radial traps are suddenly removed after\nthe formation of the superfluid. First we consider a cigar-shaped Fermi superfluid with\n\u03bb = 0.25 which is allowed to expand freely in the axial direction by setting the axial trap\nsuddenly to zero in the 3D equation. The radial trap is left unchanged. The resultant\nexpansion is studied using the full 3D DF equation (29) as well as the reduced 1D DF\nequation (30) using the chemical potential (35). The rms axial size as calculated from\nthe 3D and 1D equations are plotted in figure 3 (a). Next we consider a disk-shaped\nFermi superfluid with \u03bb = 4, which is allowed to expand freely in the radial direction\nby setting the radial trap suddenly to zero in the 3D equation. The axial trap is left\nunchanged. The resultant expansion is studied using the full 3D DF equation (29) as\nwell as the reduced 2D DF equation (37) using the chemical potential (44). The rms\nradial size as calculated from the 3D and 2D equations are plotted in figure 3 (b). The\nagreement between the dynamics as obtained from the full 3D DF equation and that\nfrom the reduced DF equations in Figs. 2 and 3 is quite satisfactory.\n4. Conclusion\nIn conclusion, we have suggested time-dependent mean-field reduced DF equations in\n1D and 2D, respectively, for a cigar- and disk-shaped BEC and Fermi superfluid in the\nBCS and unitarity limits with simple analytic nonlinear terms. The numerical solution of\nthese reduced equations reveals that they produce results for density of Fermi superfluids\nand BEC in cigar- and disk-shaped traps in excellent agreement with the solution of the\n\n\fMean-field equations for cigar- and disk-shaped Bose and Fermi superfluids\n\n13\n\nfull 3D DF equation. We also studied non-stationary breathing oscillation of the cigarand disk-shaped Fermi superfluid initiated by a sudden change of axial and radial traps,\nrespectively. Finally, we applied the reduced equations to the study of free expansion\nof a cigar- and disk-shaped Fermi superfluid initiated by a sudden removal of the axial\nand radial trap, respectively. The reduced equations produced equally good results in\nboth these studies when compared with the solution of the full 3D equations.\nAcknowledgments\nFAPESP, CAPES and CNPq (Brazil) provided partial support.\nReferences\n[1] Dalfovo F, Giorgini S, Pitaevskii L and Stringari S 1999 Rev.
