We prove that if A is an infinite von Neumann algebra\n(i. e., the identity can be decomposed as a sum of a sequence of\npairwise disjoint projections, all equivalent to the identity) then\nthe cyclic cohomology of A vanishes. We show that the method of\nthe proof applies to certain algebras of infinite matrices.\n\n1. Introduction\nCyclic cohomology is a theory introduced by Alain Connes in [1] with\nthe intent to do the analogue of de Rham cohomology in the context\nof nocommutative operator algebras (also independently discovered by\nB. Tsygan [6] and J.-L. Loday and D. Quillen [3] in the context of\nhomology of Lie algebras).\nIn the paper [1, Part II, pp 310-360], A. Connes develops the theory\nfrom scratch, and the result we prove here was an effort to make precise\nthe idea sketched in the end of page 319 and the beginning of the page\n320, in which he indicates the proof of this fact for the algebra of\ninfinite matrices introduced in [2]. This we do explicitly in Corollary 2\nbelow. More precisely, we show by an elementary argument that all the\ncyclic cohomology groups of an infinite von Neumann algebra vanish.\nWe recall that an infinite von Neumann algebra is one which have two\n(and therefore a parwise disjoint sequence) disjoint projections whose\nsum is the identity.\nThis implies in particular that if H is an infinite dimensional Hilbert\nspace, then the cyclic cohomology of the algebra L(H) of bounded operators in H has trivial cyclic cohomology (as observed by M. Wodzicki\nin [7], in the context of homology). On the other hand, since H\u03bb0 (A)\nis the set of tracial funcionals in A, if the algebra A has a finite trace,\nthen the cohomology does not vanish.\nSince a von Neumann algebra M can be decomposed uniquely as\na direct sum of subalgebras MI , MII1 , MII\u221e and MIII , of types I,\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

We assume that the reader is familiar with [1, Part II, pp\n310-360].\nThe author wishes to thank Prof. S. T. Melo for helpful discussions. This work was done while the author recieved research grant Nr.\n301238/91-0 from CNPq (Brazil).\n2. The main result\nThe main ingredient we use is the following result by A. Connes.\nFACT 1. Let A be a unital C-algebra. Suppose that there is a homomorphism \u03c1 : A \u2192 A and a matrix V \u2208 M2 (A), such that\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0015\na 0\n0 0\n\u22121\nV\nV =\n.\n0 \u03c1(a)\n0 \u03c1(a)\nThen the cyclic cohomology of A vanishes. (See [1, Proposition 5.2,\npage 319].)\nNow, some basic facts about von Neumann algebras.\nFACT 2. If A is an infinite von Neumann algebra, then there are partial isometries wn , vn \u2208 A, n \u2208 N, satisfying\nPpn = vn wn is a projection,\nwn vn = 1, pn pm = 0 if n 6= m, and 1 = n pn . (See [5, Proposition\n2.2.4, page 84].)\nWe list some properties of the elements vn , wn \u2208 A:\n(1) wn pn = wn ,\n(2) pn vn = vn ,\n(3) wn vm = 0, if n 6= m,\n(4) we can assume that kvn k, kwn k \u2264 1.\nProposition 1. If A is an infinite von Neumann algebra, then the\ncyclic cohomology of A vanishes.\nP\nProof. Let \u03c1 : A \u2192 A, \u03c1(a) = i\u22650 v2i+1 a w2i+1\nLet \u03b81 , \u03b82 , \u03b83 \u2208 A be the elements\nX\n\u03b81 =\npi = 1 \u2212 p0 ,\ni\u22651\n\n\u03b82 = p0 +\n\nX\ni\u22651\n\n(v2i w2i\u22121 + v2i\u22121 w2i )\n\n\fCYCLIC COHOMOLOGY OF VON NEUMANN ALGEBRAS\n\n\u03b83 =\n\nX\n\n3\n\n(v2i w2i+1 + v2i+1 w2i )\n\ni\u22650\n\nAll these sums converge in the strong operator topology and k\u03c1(a)k \u2264\nkak.\nObserve that if A acts as an algebra of operators in the Hilbert space\nH, then \u03b82 maps p0 H onto itself and maps p2i H and p2i+1 H (i > 0)\nonto each other. Also, \u03b83 maps p2i H and p2i+1 H (i \u2265 0) onto each\nother.\nWe have the following relations: \u03b812 = 1 \u2212 p0 , \u03b822 = \u03b832 = 1, w0 \u03b81 =\n\u03b81 v0 = 0, and\n\u03b81 \u03c1(a)\u03b81 = \u03c1(a)\nX\nv2i a w2i\n\u03b82 (v0 aw0 + \u03c1(a))\u03b82 =\ni\u22650\n\n\u03b83 (\n\nX\n\nv2i a w2i )\u03b83 = \u03c1(a)\n\ni\u22650\n\nWe define the matrices X, Y, Z \u2208 M2 (A) as follows.\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0 w0\n1 0\n1 0\nX=\n, Y =\n, Z=\n.\nv0 \u03b81\n0 \u03b82\n0 \u03b83\nThen X, Y and Z are invertible and X \u22121\nand if V = ZY X, then V \u22121 = XY Z, and\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\na 0\n0\n\u22121\nV\nV =\n0 \u03c1(a)\n0\nBy Fact 1, this implies the vanishing of\nA.\nAs corollaries to the proof, we have:\n\n= X, Y \u22121 = Y , Z \u22121 = Z,\n\u0015\n0\n.\n\u03c1(a)\nthe cyclic cohomology of\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 1. The quotient algebra of an infinite von Neumann algebra\nby a norm closed ideal has vanishing cyclic cohomology. In particular,\nthe Calkin algebra Q = B(H)/K(H) has zero cyclic cohomology, for\nH an infinite dimensional Hilbert space.\nProof. If u, v \u2208 A, uv = 1 and vu = p, a projection, and I a proper\nnorm closed ideal, then p 6\u2208 I. Therefore the computations done in the\nproof of the proposition goes through the quotient.\n\u0003\nLet C be the algebra introduced in [2], of infinite matrices (ai,j )i,j\u2208N\nsuch that\n\u2022 the set {ai,j : i, j \u2208 N} is finite,\n\u2022 the number of nonzero entries in each line and each collumn is\nbounded.\n\n\f4\n\nRICARDO BIANCONI\n\nLet D be the algebra of infinite matrices (ai,j ) such that the number\nof nonzero entries in each line and each collumn is finite.\nCorollary 2. The cyclic cohomology groups of C and of D vanish.\nProof. Repeat the proof of the proposition but now with the sums\ndefined componentwise (therefore finite in each component). We only\nneed to define the elements vn and wn .SLet Ik \u2282 N, k \u2208 N, be pairwise\ndisjoint infinite sets, such that N = k\u22650 Ik . Enumerate each Ik as\nIk = {ik,n : n \u2265 0} (for instance in increasing order). We define the\nmatrices vn = (ani,j )i,j\u2208N (and wn as the transpose of vn ) as\n\u001a\n1, if i \u2208 In and i = in,j ,\nn\nai,j =\n0, otherwise.\nP\nThen the entry i, j of wn vn is k\u22650 ank,i ank,j , which is 1 if i = j and\n0 otherwise, that\nP is, wn vn = 1. On the other hand, the entry i, j of\npn = vn wn is k\u22650 ani,k anj,k , which is 1 if i = j \u2208 IP\nn (i = j = in,k \u2208 In ,\nfor a unique k \u2265 0) and 0 otherwise. Clearly 1 = n pn , and all these\nmatrices belong to the algebras C and D.\n\u0003\nReferences\n1. A. Connes, Noncommutative differential geometry. Inst. Hautes \u00c9tudes Sci.\nPubl. Math.
