The origin of the IMF has recently been a subject of intense interest (see Bonnell et al. 2007 for a review).\nObservationally, studies of the core mass function (CMF)\nhave shown it to have a similar form to the IMF (Motte et\nal. 1998; Testi & Sergent 1998; Johnstone et al. 2000,2001;\nMotte et al. 2001; Johnstone & Bally 2006; Young et al.\n2006; Alves et al. 2007; Nutter & Ward-Thompson 2007;\nSimpson et al. 2008; Enoch et al. 2008) suggesting a link between the two (see, in particular, Alves et al. 2007; Goodwin\net al. 2008).\nIt is often assumed that if the IMF of two regions is the\nsame, then star formation in those two regions must have\nbeen basically the same. However, the IMF is the mass function of individual stars. Therefore the IMF \u2013 taken in isolation \u2013 ignores the fact that many stars are in multiple systems, and that most/many stars are thought to have formed\nas multiples (e.g., Goodwin & Kroupa 2005; Kouwenhoven\net al. 2005, 2007; Goodwin et al. 2007; Goodwin et al. 2008,\nand references therein; see also Lada 2006). The IMF thus\nignores a large amount of information related to the star\nformation process that is stored in the binary population.\nDuring star formation, many cores must collapse and\nfragment into a multiple system (Goodwin & Kroupa 2005;\nGoodwin et al. 2007). Therefore, it is the system mass function (SMF) that we should expect to follow the CMF (as emphasised by Goodwin et al. 2008). The IMF is produced by\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: s.goodwin@sheffield.ac.uk\n\nsplitting these multiple systems into their component parts.\nHow the masses of the individual stars in the IMF are distributed depends not only upon the SMF, but on the binary\nfraction and mass ratio distribution of systems. Moreover,\nthese quantities may well be mass-dependent.\nIn this paper we show that very different models for the\nconversion of the CMF to the SMF and from the SMF to the\nIMF can produce very similar IMFs. In Section 2 we outline\nour method and the results, and we discuss the implications\nin Section 3.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nFROM THE CMF TO THE IMF\nMethod\n\nFollowing Goodwin et al. (2008) we have constructed a simple model of multiple star formation from 'cores'1 . We assume a universal core mass function with a log-normal form\n(although as we describe below, this is not an important assumption). This form is based on the observations of Alves\net al. (2007) and Nutter & Ward-Thompson (2007). We\ntake the average mass to be \u223c 1M\u2299 , and the width to be\n\u03c3log10 M \u223c 0.5. We then randomly sample cores from this\nCMF in a Monte Carlo simulation (see also earlier studies\nby Larson (1973), Elmegreen & Mathieu (1983), and Zinnecker (1983)).\nWe note that taking a log-normal form means that we\nfail to reproduce the power-law tail at high-mass that is observed and expected theoretically (e.g. Padoan & Nordlund\n1\n\nSuch cores may be classical isolated cores (e.g., WardThompson et al. 2007), or just dense regions in which stars form\n(i.e. the star forming clumps see in simulations such as those of\nBate 2009a,b).\n\n\f2\n\nS.P. Goodwin & M.B.N. Kouwenhoven\nnormal form of the CMF is one of the main reasons why the\nfollowing distributions also maintain a log-normal form.\n\n1.00\n\n0.8\n\nMass distribution\n\nCore-to-star efficiency\n\n1.0\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n\n2.2\n0.10\n\n0.01\n0.01\n\n0.10 1.00 10.00 100.00\nCore mass (Msun)\n\n0.01\n\n0.10 1.00 10.00 100.00\nMass (Msun)\n\nFigure 1. On the right we show the system mass functions (dotted, dashed, and dash-dot lines) produced from a single core mass\nfunction (solid line), produced by different core-to-star efficiencies\nwith mass shown on the left (with corresponding dotted, dashed,\nand dash-dot lines).\n\n2002; Hennebelle & Chabrier 2008), and so we do not expect\nto fit the IMF properly at high masses.\nWe create a system mass function from a core mass\nfunction by converting each core into a system with a particular efficiency. Thus, a core of mass MC will become a\nsystem of mass MS = \u01ebMC , where \u01eb is the core-to-star efficiency. The core-to-star efficiency may depend on the mass\nof the core, and even upon the mass ratio of the stars within\nthe core.\nWe show below that, depending on the core mass function and the core-to-star efficiency, many different system\nmass functions can be formed. Therefore, we use an assumed\nsystem mass function and then convert the mass of the system MS into stars of mass M1 and M2 , or or into a single\nstar, depending on the binary fraction to create an IMF.\nThe mass ratio q = M2 /M1 is drawn from a mass ratio\ndistribution (MRD) in the range 0 < q 6 1. The corresponding masses of the primary and companion star are then\nM1 = MS (q + 1)\u22121 and M2 = MS (q \u22121 + 1)\u22121 (see Kouwenhoven et al. 2008 for a detailed study of pairing functions in\nbinary systems). For simplicity, we will only consider single\nstars and binary systems.\nFinally, the IMF is given by the distribution of masses\nof all individual stars (single stars, primaries, companions)\nin all of the systems. We then compare this derived IMF to\nthe 'canonical' Chabrier (2003) log-normal IMF.\nIn summary, we have an initial core mass function\n(CMF). A combination of the CMF and the core-to-star efficiency (CSE) gives the system mass function (SMF). Combining the SMF and the mass ratio distribution (MRD) then\ngives the stellar initial mass function (IMF). Note that the\nCSE may depend on the MRD as we shall discuss below.\nWe have assumed at the first step that the CMF is universal (and has a log-normal form). Clearly this assumption\nmay well be wrong. Firstly, determinations of the CMF are\nvery difficult, and it is not clear if the observed CMF is\nindeed the CMF that should be used as the underlying distribution from which stars form (Clark et al. 2007; Hatchell\n& Fuller 2008; Smith et al. 2008; Swift & Williams 2008).\nHowever, for the purposes of this paper we wish to show\nthat even if the CMF is universal, we are able to produce\nthe canonical IMF through different modes of star formation. However, as we shall see later, the assumed initial log-\n\nFrom the CMF to the SMF\n\nIn Fig. 1 we show how it is possible to change the width and\nshape of the SMF formed from the CMF by changing how\nthe CSE varies with core mass. If high-mass cores are more\nefficient at converting gas to stars than low-mass cores, the\nthe SMF is broader than the CMF. However, if low-mass\ncores are more efficient, then the SMF is narrower than the\nCMF. But note that the resultant SMF always has a roughly\nlog-normal form, often with a just a small degree of skewness\nadded.\nPresumably, the CSE is not independent of mass. The\nhigher the level of feedback from stars the lower we might\nexpect the CSE to be. However, this may not be a trivial\nrelationship. More massive stars presumably produce more\nfeedback2 , and so be able to reduce the fraction of a core\nthat accretes onto the system. On the other hand, a more\nmassive core is also more bound and so more difficult to\ndisperse.\nAn interesting possibility is that the CSE depends not\njust on the mass of the system, but also on the mass ratio\nof that system. It is possible that an unequal-mass system\n(say, 1.8M\u2299 \u20130.2M\u2299 ) will produce far more feedback than\nan equal-mass system (say, 1M\u2299 \u20131M\u2299 ) with the same system mass. Therefore, a larger core is required to form the\nfirst system. Also, as pointed-out by Myers (2008), the CSE\nshould also depend on the core density.\n2.3\n\nFrom systems to stars\n\nIn Fig. 2 we present the IMFs that result from systems with\na binary fraction of unity for a selection of very different\nchoices for the MRD. We have fine-tuned the SMFs in order\nto obtain good fits to the canonical IMF. What is clear from\nFig. 2 is that very different choices for the MRD are all able\nto produce the canonical IMF.\nA potential problem is that we have introduced a finetuning element in that the SMF has been chosen to give the\nbest-fit to the canonical IMF for a given MRD. However, this\nfine-tuning is not significant. As indicated in the captions\nto each part of Fig. 2, the SMFs do not vary very much,\nwith means of \u03bclog10 M = \u22120.3, \u22120.4, \u22120.3, and \u22120.35 and\nvariances of \u03c3log10 M = 0.4, 0.55, 0.4, and 0.5, respectively,\nfor the different models.\nIt would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish observationally differences in the mean of the SMF\nbetween 0.4 and 0.5M\u2299 , and differences in the 1\u03c3 widths of\n0.1 \u2013 0.2M\u2299 at one end, and 1.25 \u2013 1.40M\u2299 at the other. Indeed, the models presented in Figs. 2a and 2c have identical\nSMFs despite having completely different MRDs (a single\npeak at q \u223c 0.3, compared to peaks at q = 0.1 and 0.8) and\nyet both give good fits to the canonical IMF.\nAll of the models presented in Fig. 2 have assumed that\n2\n\nAssuming a main sequence-like relationship the massluminosity relationship would go as L \u221d M 3.5 , however the massluminosity relationship for PMS stars is highly complex and ageand mass-dependent.\n\n\fWhat does a universal IMF imply about star formation?\nall systems produce a binary (as shown in Fig. 3). Clearly,\nthe canonical IMF can also be recovered from a SMF of\nentirely single stars if the SMF is exactly the same as the\nIMF. However, we know that a significant fraction of systems\nin the field are multiples, and that presumably many more\nwere multiples at birth as multiples are destroyed, but not\ncreated (Kroupa 1995a,b; Parker et al. 2009).\nGoodwin et al. (2008) found that \u2013 assuming a constant\nCSE and a uniform MRD \u2013 a model with a binary fraction\nof unity was a better fit to the canonical IMF than one in\nwhich binarity declined with system (ie. primary) mass as\nis observed in the field (see Lada 2006).\nIn Fig. 4 we show the best fits to the canonical IMF for\nthe same set of MRDs as in Fig. 2, but for a binary fraction\nthat varies with system mass as shown in Fig. 3 \u2013 unity\nfor a system mass > 1M\u2299 , linear for 0.1 < Msys /M\u2299 < 1,\nand 0.1 for Msys < 0.1M\u2299 . In order to fit the canonical\nIMF for each MRD the best SMFs are \u03bclog10 M = \u22120.6 and\n\u03c3log10 M = 0.6 for all of our models. The peaks of the SMFs\n(\u223c 0.25M\u2299 ) are lower than for a binary fraction of unity as\nthe reduced number of low-mass companions means that the\nlow-mass end of the IMF must be made-up largely of single\nstars directly from the SMF. The increased width is then\nrequired in order to allow sufficient numbers of higher-mass\nstars to form.\nIt might seem that this result is at odds with Goodwin et al. (2008). However, Goodwin et al. set the CMF\nwith which to generate the SMF and then the IMF as being\nthe Orion/Pipe Nebula CMF (with a mean of \u223c 1M\u2299 and\nvariance of \u03c3log10 M = 0.55, see above) and a constant CSE.\nGiven these constraints it is impossible to form an SMF\nwith a mean of 0.25M\u2299 and a variance of \u03c3log10 M = 0.6 as\nrequired to produce the canonical IMF with a decreasing\nbinary fraction. However, as we show here, if the CMF is\ndifferent, or if the CSE is such that the variance is increased\nand the mean lowered significantly such a CMF can produce\nthe canonical IMF with a varying binary fraction.\nWe have also examined the effect of using a CMF\nthat is not log-normal (in particular, triangular and tophat CMFs). Features in the CMF are always reflected in\nsome way (even if distorted) in the SMF and the IMF no\nmatter our choice of the CSE and MRD. Thus the apparently smooth log-normal-like shape of the IMF would seem\nto be a natural consequence of the log-normal-like shape of\nthe CMF (cf. Elmegreen & Mathieu 1983; Zinnecker 1983).\nHowever, the lack of features tells us that the CMF that produces the SMF that produces the IMF is highly unlikely to\ncontain any sharp features or discontinuities as these should\nbe apparent in the IMF.\nIt is surprising that the IMF is so insensitive to the\nMRD of stars. The reason is that the IMF is so insensitive is\nthat it retains the log-normal-like shape of the SMF (which\nitself is retained from the CMF). As the SMF is distributed\nin a roughly log-normal way, each chosen mass ratio from\nthe MRD retains this shape (e.g. for an MRD of two delta\nfunctions, the SMF will produce two stellar distributions,\neach a log-normal). Thus the IMF is the sum of a number\nof log-normals thus retaining the log-normal shape3 .\n\n3\n\nIt is possible to produce other distributions. For example an\nMRD which always produces a star with 99.9 per cent of the\n\n3\n\nIt is interesting to examine what form we might expect the MRD to have. We would expect that most binaries form via the fragmentation of discs (or massive disc-like\nobjects) around young stars (see Goodwin et al. 2007 for\na review). If discs fragment early then the secondary will\nform whilst there is still a significant amount of material\nto accrete and we might expect the MRD to favour more\nequal-mass systems. If the discs fragment late after the primary has accreted most of its mass then there will be little\nmaterial left to accrete and unequal-mass systems might predominate (as might also happen if the secondary formed at\na large distance from the primary). Thus the MRD might\ncontain information on the formation time of secondaries\n(which might depend on the amount of angular momentum\nor strength of magnetic fields in the core?). If the MRD\nfavours unequal-mass binaries then the primary IMF will\nreflect well the form of the SMF, however if many binaries\nare more equal-mass then the primary IMF would not.\n\n3\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have investigated the origin of the stellar initial mass\nfunction (IMF) as produced by a system mass function\n(SMF), which is itself formed from a particular core mass\nfunction (CMF). The CMF is converted to the SMF via a\ncore-to-star efficiency (CSE) factor, and then turned into\nthe IMF via a mass ratio distribution (MRD). Our main\nfindings are:\n\u2022 Different core-to-star efficiencies can significantly\nchange the width and shape of the system mass function\nformed from a given core mass function.\n\u2022 Very different mass ratio distributions within systems\ncan produce very similar (and canonical) IMFs from very\nsimilar system mass functions.\nThus, we conclude that observing the same initial mass function in different regions does not necessarily mean that star\nformation was the same in those regions. For very different\nchoices of the mass ratio distribution in star forming cores,\nthe same (canonical) IMF may be found. In addition, the\nform of the IMF is surprisingly insensitive to the variation\nof the binary fraction with mass (modulo the position of the\npeak of the system mass function).\nThis raises a question about the universality, or nonuniversality, of star formation based on observing the same\nIMF in different regions. If one star forming region produced\nsystems with generally equal-mass stars, whilst another produced systems with generally comparatively low-mass companions, it seems very difficult to claim that star formation\nin those regions was the same. However, the core mass functions, system mass functions, and the IMFs could all be very\nsimilar. Therefore, in order to claim that star formation is\nthe same in different regions, the birth system mass function and mass ratio distribution of binaries, and the binary\nfraction, must also be the same.\nmass in a core, and a planet with 0.1 per cent of the mass. In\nsuch a situation the two log-normals would be so far apart that\nthey would appear as two separate log-normals. However observations show that typical mass ratios are in the range 0.1 \u2013 1 (e.g.\nDuquennoy & Mayor 1991).\n\n\f4\n\nS.P. Goodwin & M.B.N. Kouwenhoven\n\nIt is important to note that it is the birth system mass\nfunctions and mass ratio distributions that must be determined. Dynamical evolution can seriously alter the initial\nbinary population in a cluster (e.g. Kroupa 1995a, 1995b;\nParker et al. 2009) and destroy much of the vital information on the birth properties.\nIt is important to note that the peak mass of the IMF\nwhich always seems to occur at \u223c 0.1 \u2013 0.3M\u2299 does constrain the star formation process. The initial core mass functions must always have a similar peak mass which is then\nimposed on the system mass function (regulated by the coreto-star efficiency) which is then imposed on the IMF (but\nregulated by the mass ratio distribution including the binary\nfraction). If the binary fraction varies between different star\nformating regions the peak of the core mass functions could\nchange by a factor of 2 or 3, but no more. Thus the underlying core mass functions in all regions should probably have\na peak mass of order 1M\u2299 .\n\n4\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe would like to thank the referee, Charlie Lada, for his useful comments.
