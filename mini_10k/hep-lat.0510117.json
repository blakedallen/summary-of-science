Introduction\nThe overlap operator [1,2] , gives a theoretically sound solution of the chirality problem on\nthe lattice. It satisfies the Ginsparg-Wilson relation [3, 4], which ensures the exact chiral\nsymmetry at finite lattice spacing [5], moreover the difference in the number of left and\nright handed zero modes can be taken as a definition of the topological charge (Q) which\ngives the correct result in the continuum limit [6].\nHowever, the numerical implementation of dynamical overlap fermions is still a great\nchallenge today (for early studies with dynamical overlap fermions we refer to [7\u20139]). The\npresence of nested conjugate gradients for the inversion of the Dirac operator makes the\nsimulations considerably slower than simulations with Wilson fermions. Furthermore one\nhas to face the non-continuity of the fermion determinant at the boundary of topological\nsectors. This additional difficulty can be treated exactly in frame of the Hybrid Monte Carlo\n(HMC) algorithm by modifying the molecular dynamics trajectory at the boundary [10].\nClearly the crossing rate between different topological sectors is heavily affected by this\nmodification. Inappropriate treatment might confine the system into a certain topological\nsector which yields an unacceptably large autocorrelation time for Q in the simulation.\nA few exploratory studies are already available in QCD with dynamical overlap fermions [10\u201315]. All handle the modification of the trajectory at the boundary in a similar\nstyle. The original proposal of [10] is modified in [13] in such a way that the acceptance\nrate is increased. It is shown in [14], that the introduction of several pseudofermion fields\nwhich approximate the fermion determinant, can enhance the crossing rate. The relation\nbetween the pseudofermionic (over)estimation and rare topological sector changes1 was\npointed out in [15].\n1\n\nIn the staggered formulation there was already a concern that the pseudofermion estimator obstruct\nthe change of topological charge [16].\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fIn this paper we study the problem of changing topological sectors in the case of the\noverlap operator with nf = 2 fermions in dynamical HMC simulations. Sec. 2 will give a\nshort introduction to the sector changing problem for overlap fermions (by summarizing and\nextending the work of [15]), and answers the question why the present treatment is unlikely\nto change Q. In Sec. 3 a new measurement method of expectation values is proposed,\nwhich circumvents the crossing problem entirely by making simulations constrained to\nfixed topological sectors. In Sec. 4 we present numerical results using the new measurement\nmethod. In Sec. 5 conclusions are given.\n\n2. Topological sector changing problem\nAfter introducing pseudofermion fields [17], our partition function reads:\nZ\nZ\n\u2020 \u22122\n2\n\u2212Sg\ndet H = [dU ][d\u03c6\u2020 ][d\u03c6]e\u2212Sg \u2212\u03c6 H \u03c6 ,\nZ = [dU ]e\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere H is the hermitian overlap operator:\nH = (1 \u2212\n\nm\n)H0 + \u03b35 m,\n2m0\n\n(2.2)\n\nwith H0 being the massless hermitian overlap operator:\nH0 = m0 [\u03b35 + sgn(HW )].\n\n(2.3)\n\nHere HW is the standard Wilson operator with negative mass \u2212m0 . The sgn function in\nH0 causes a Dirac-\u03b4 type singularity in the equation of motion of the momenta of the link\nvariables. The \u03b4-function gives a contribution whenever an eigenvalue \u03bb of HW changes\nsign. This subspace of the configuration space coincide with topological sector boundaries.\nThe reason for this is that in the case of the overlap operator the topological charge is:\nQ=\n\n1\n1X\nsgn(\u03bbi )\nTr(H0 ) =\n2m0\n2\n\n(2.4)\n\ni\n\nThis means, that there are potential walls, non-differentiable steps in the action at the\ntopological sector boundaries. The reflection-refraction method suggested in [10] handles\nthese potential walls correctly. Let's denote the momenta by p and the normal vector of\nthe topological sector boundary by n. According to this method one has to modify the\nmomenta, when arriving at a potential wall:\np\u2192\n\n(\n\nq\n\u2206S\n2\np \u2212 nhn, pi + nhn, pi 1 \u2212 2 hn,pi\n2 , if hn, pi > 2\u2206S (refraction)\nif hn, pi2 < 2\u2206S (reflection)\n\np \u2212 2nhn, pi,\n\n(2.5)\n\nThus the trajectory will go through the topological sector boundary only if hn, pi2 > 2\u2206S.\nIn a HMC algorithm hn, pi = O(1) and has exponential distribution. \u2206S, however, is not\nthe exact value of the height of the potential wall, but it is the change of the pseudofermionic\naction at the boundary. From now on, we will distinguish between these two quantities.\nWe call the former \u2206Sexact and the latter \u2206Spf .\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fLet us take a closer look2 on the relation between \u2206Sexact and h\u2206Spf i. In particular,\nwe show that the jump in the pseudofermionic action overestimates \u2206Sexact . Let us assume\nthat the trajectory crosses the boundary. Let H\u2212 and H+ be the overlap operator evaluated\non the two sides of the boundary right before and after the crossing, respectively. Clearly\nH\u2212 and H+ contain the same gauge configuration, but they differ, since one eigenvalue of\nHW changes sign on the boundary. In the HMC algorithm one chooses the pseudofermion\nfield as\n\u03c6 = H\u2212 \u03b7,\n\u03c6\u2020 = \u03b7 \u2020 H\u2212 ,\nwhere \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2020 are random vectors with Gaussian distribution, in order to generate \u03c6, \u03c6\u2020 with\nthe correct distribution. (In a real simulation one chooses new pseudofermion configurations\nonly at the beginning of each trajectory, but for simplicity let's consider, that \u03c6 and \u03c6\u2020 are\nrefreshed when hitting the boundary.) The jump of the pseudofermionic action now reads:\n\u22122\nH\u2212 \u2212 1)\u03b7\n\u2206Spf = Spf+ \u2212 Spf\u2212 = \u03b7 \u2020 (H\u2212 H+\n\nThe relation between \u2206Sexact and \u2206Spf can be obtained by the following straightforward\ncalculation:\n\u2212\u2206Sexact\n\ne\n\n= he\u2212\u03b7\n\n\u2020 (H\n\n2\ndet H+\n=\n2 =\ndet H\u2212\n\n\u22122\n\u2212 H+ H\u2212 \u22121)\u03b7\n\nR\n\n\u2020\n\n\u2020\n\n\u22122\n\n[d\u03b7 \u2020 ][d\u03b7]e\u2212\u03b7 \u03b7 e\u2212\u03b7 (H\u2212 H+\nR\n[d\u03b7 \u2020 ][d\u03b7]e\u2212\u03b7\u2020 \u03b7\n\n\u22122\n\u2212h\u03b7\u2020 (H\u2212 H+\nH\u2212 \u22121)\u03b7i\u03b7\u2020 \u03b7\n\ni\u03b7\u2020 \u03b7 \u2265 e\n\nH\u2212 \u22121)\u03b7\n\n=\n= e\u2212h\u2206Spf i\n\nThe inequality in the second line is a consequence of the concavity of the e\u2212x function. So\nwe conclude to:\nh\u2206Spf i \u2265 \u2206Sexact .\nWe can examine this relation in realistic simulations, if we take into account, that\nthere is a simple relation between H+ and H\u2212 . Let's denote by \u03bb0 the eigenvalue of HW\nwhich crosses zero at the boundary, and by |0i the eigenvector belonging to \u03bb0 . With this\nnotation:\nH+ = H\u2212 + c|0ih0|,\nwhere\n\nm\n),\n2m0\nwith \u2206sgn\u03bb0 = \u00b12 being the jump of sgn\u03bb0 on the boundary. The expectation value of\nthe discontinuity in the pseudofermionic action is:\nc = \u2206sgn\u03bb0 m0 (1 \u2212\n\n\u22122\n\u22122\nH\u2212 \u2212 1) =\nH\u2212 \u2212 1)\u03b7i\u03b7\u2020 \u03b7 = Tr(H\u2212 H+\nh\u2206Spf i = h\u03b7 \u2020 (H\u2212 H+\n\u0001\n\u22122\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n|0i.\n|0i + c2 h0|H+\n|0ih0|) \u2212 1 = \u22122ch0|H+\n)(1 \u2212 c H+\n= Tr (1 \u2212 c|0ih0|H+\n\n(2.6)\n\nIn a similar way one can get a simple formula for the exact value of the jump on the\nboundary:\ne\u2212\u2206Sexact =\n2\n\n2\ndet H+\n1\n1\n1\n=\n=\n=\n.

(2.6) and eq. (2.7) offers a numerically fast way to determine both action jumps, since\none needs only one inversion of the overlap operator to obtain both of them.\n\nFigure 1: The jump in the exact vs. pseudofermionic action at \u03b2 = 4.05 and m = 0.1, 0.2. Since the\naverage of hn, pi2 is around \u2248 1, topological sector changing would happen considerably frequently\nusing Sexact , than with Spf . We also indicated the probability of topological sector changing with\nthe pseudofermionic action, and an estimate on the probability using the exact action (assuming\nthat the two algorithms would behave the same way except for the boundaries).\n\nFor illustration we made a scatter plot (Fig. 1) from a 64 lattice at two different\nmasses. (Details of our action will be described in Section 4.) One can clearly see, that\nthe use of the pseudofermions has an awkward consequence: there are a huge amount\nof crossings, where the topological sector changing fails only due to the overestimation.\nOne way to cure this is to use several pseudofermion estimators instead of one [14]. More\npseudofermions mean smaller spread of the pseudofermionic action distribution, therefore\nthe overestimation is smaller, too. However the computational time also increases with\nthe number of extra fields. Obviously the best would be to use the exact action in the\nsimulations, but only its discontinuity on the boundary can be calculated easily. The next\nsection will present a technique, which uses this discontinuity to get the relative weight of\ntopological sectors.\n\n3. The new method\nIn this section we propose a new method for the calculation of physical observables by which\nit becomes possible to circumvent the problem of topological sector changing described in\nthe previous section. Let us write the partition function in the form (assuming a vanishing\n\u03b8 parameter):\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fZ=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nZQ ,\n\nQ=\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere ZQ is the partition function of the topological sector Q. The expectation value of\nan observable:\nP ZQ\nP\nhOiQ\nQ\nQ ZQ hOiQ\nP\n= PZ0 Z\nhOi =\n,\nQ\nQ ZQ\nQ Z0\n\nwhere the restricted expectation value hOiQ is\nZ\n1\n2\n[dU ]Q O[U ] det HQ\nexp(\u2212Sg ).\nhOiQ =\nZQ\n\nFor reasons which will be clear later the integration goes not only over the configurations\nwith Q charge, but also over the boundary of the topological sector as well (though the\nboundary has only zero measure in this case). When calculating the partition function\nin a given topological sector the following boundary prescription is used: we define the\ndeterminant on the boundary as the limit of determinants approaching the wall from the\n2 ). If the measurement of the quantities Z\nQ side (det HQ\nQ+1 /ZQ would be possible, then\nwe could recover ZQ /Z0 for any Q. With these in hand, we would need only the restricted\nexpectation values hOiQ , whose measurement doesn't require topological sector changings.\nNow we will show a way to measure ZQ+1 /ZQ . It will make use of the fact, that\nwe can calculate easily \u2206Sexact on the boundary of topological sectors (see eq. (2.7)).\nThe pseudofermionic action is only used to generate configurations in fixed topological\nsectors, so its bad distribution for the jump of the action will not effect us. (In the\nfollowing formulae \u2206S will automatically mean \u2206Sexact .) The main idea is the following:\nan observable measured in sector Q is inversely proportional to ZQ and an observable in\nQ+1 is to ZQ+1 . If the observables in the two sectors are concentrated only to the common\nwall separating the two sectors, then from the ratio of the two expectation values one can\nrecover the ratio of the two sectors.\nFirst let us measure in the Q sector an operator, which is concentrated to the boundary:\nZ\n1\n2\nh\u03b4Q,Q+1 F iQ =\n[dU ]Q \u03b4Q,Q+1 F [U ] det HQ\nexp(\u2212Sg ),\n(3.1)\nZQ\nwhere we introduced the distribution \u03b4Q,Q+1 , a Dirac-\u03b4, which is equal to zero everywhere\nbut on the Q, Q + 1 boundary. Then let us measure another operator G on the same wall\n(thus on the boundary separating sectors Q and Q + 1), but now from the Q + 1 sector:\nZ\n1\n2\n[dU ]Q+1 \u03b4Q,Q+1 G[U ] det HQ+1\nexp(\u2212Sg ).\n(3.2)\nh\u03b4Q,Q+1 GiQ+1 =\nZQ+1\nThe wall is the same (i.e. [dU ]Q \u03b4Q,Q+1 = [dU ]Q+1 \u03b4Q,Q+1 ) in both cases, however due to our\nboundary prescription the determinants are different on it. Therefore if F and G satisfies:\n2\n2\nF [U ] det HQ\n[U ] = G[U ] det HQ+1\n[U ],\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n(3.3)\n\n\fthen the ratio of eq. (3.1) and eq. (3.2) gives us\nh\u03b4Q,Q+1 F iQ\nZQ+1\n=\n.\nh\u03b4Q,Q+1 GiQ+1\nZQ\n\n(3.4)\n\n2\n2 = exp(\u2212\u2206S), the ratio\nThe easiest choice is G(U ) = 1 and F (U ) = det HQ+1\n/ det HQ\nof sectors becomes:\nh\u03b4Q,Q+1 exp(\u2212\u2206S)iQ\n.\n(3.5)\nZQ+1 /ZQ =\nh\u03b4Q,Q+1 iQ+1\n\nThis choice is still not optimal, since the measurement of the numerator is problematic, if\nthe distribution of \u2206S extends to negative values. The exponential function amplifies the\nsmall fluctuations in the negative \u2206S region, which can destroy the whole measurement:\na very small fraction of the configurations will dominate the result. As a consequence\none ends up with relatively large statistical uncertainties. With a slightly different choice\nof F and G we can improve on the situation. With F (U ) = \u0398(\u2206S \u2212 x) exp(\u2212\u2206S) and\nG(U ) = \u0398(\u2206S \u2212 x) we can omit the problematic part of the \u2206S distribution (the values\nsmaller than x) from the measurement, and we get:\nZQ+1 /ZQ =\n\nh\u03b4Q,Q+1 exp(\u2212\u2206S)i\u2206S>x\nQ\nh\u03b4Q,Q+1 i\u2206S>x\nQ+1\n\n.\n\n(3.6)\n\nThe price of this choice of F, G is that we do not make use of the \u2206S < x part of our data\nset. The value of x can be tuned to minimize the statistical error.\nLet us note that eq. (3.3) can be viewed as a detailed balance condition on a given U\nconfiguration between Q and Q + 1 sector (F and G are just the \"transition probabilities\").\nThis can give us a hint, that the Metropolis-step is a good a solution for F, G: F =\nmin(1, exp(\u2212\u2206S)) and G = min(1, exp(\u2206S)). The ratio of sectors is simply:\nZQ+1 /ZQ =\n\nh\u03b4Q,Q+1 min(1, exp(\u2212\u2206S))iQ\n.\nh\u03b4Q,Q+1 min(1, exp(\u2206S))iQ+1\n\n(3.7)\n\nThe inconvenient part of the distribution (\u2206S < 0) is cut off, however in contrast to eq.\n(3.6) all configurations are used to get the expectation values.\nWe have achieved our main goal: without making expensive topological sector changes\nwe can obtain the ratio of sectors (see eq. (3.5, 3.6, 3.7)). The key point is to make\nsimulations constrained to fixed topological charge, and match the results on the common boundaries of the sectors. In the next subsection we will show in the framework of\nHMC, how to measure an expectation value, which contains a Dirac-delta on the surface.\nOur proposal is that the generation of trajectories inside a sector can be done using the\npseudofermionic action, we do not need there the exact action. Since no sector changing is\nrequired, the inconvenient distribution of the pseudofermionic action jump on the boundary will not effect the measurement of the ratios of sectors. The exact action is needed\nonly on the boundary: the formulas (3.5, 3.6, 3.7) require \u2206S.\nIt is clear that using the exact fermion action when measuring the ratio of sectors\noutperforms the conventional HMC, where topological sector changing is hindered by the\ndistribution of the pseudofermionic action jump. Even in that (at the moment theoretical)\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fcase if we were able to use the exact fermionic action in simulations, the above presented\nmethod is better in determining the ratios of topological sectors. Consider a small quark\nmass simulation, where a HMC using the exact fermionic action sticks into the trivial topological sector (now due to the fact, that nontrivial topologies are suppressed by the fermion\ndeterminant). If the simulation time is not long enough, then we have no information at all\non the small (but nonvanishing) ratio Z1 /Z0 . However in our method this small quantity\ncan be measured. The more we hit the wall from the two sides the more precisely we can\nmeasure Z1 /Z0 . The same argument applies to an R-type algorithm (where it is possible\nto use the exact \u2206S jump, when crossing topological sectors [15]).\nObviously an important issue for this new method is whether topological sectors defined\nby the overlap charge are path-connected or not. We refer to some results in the Abelian and\nin the non-Abelian gauge group case [18, 19]. If configurations with the same Q would not\nbe continuously connectable in sector Q, then our assumption that we make measurements\non the common boundary of sectors could be violated. It could happen, that the wall\nsampled from sector Q does not coincide with the wall sampled from Q + 1. Moreover the\nfixed sector simulations would also violate ergodicity in this case. Let us note here that the\nlarge autocorrelation time for the topological charge in the conventional pseudofermionic\nHMC effectively also causes the breakdown of ergodicity. In case of non-connected sectors\none can cure these problems by releasing the system from a sector after a certain amount\nof time and closing it to another.\nExpectation value of a \u03b4-function\nIn a HMC simulation one determines the expectation value of an operator by calculating a sum over the measured values of the observable on N configurations, which are\ngenerated with the proper weights, by which they occur in the functional integral. In practice it is not possible to measure an operator containing a Dirac-delta on the boundary\nsurface on these configurations, because none of them will be exactly located on it. Therefore we formulate a somewhat different measurement method, and discuss its properties.\nAs a result one has to make measurements at those points of the trajectories, where they\nhit the boundary.\nLet us see the details. Consider for a moment that we are able to integrate the Hamiltonian equations of motion exactly. If the distribution of the gauge field, pseudofermion\nfield and momenta was correct at the starting point of the trajectory, then it will be still\ncorrect for any of the inner points. This fact follows from energy and area conservation\nand reversibility. So we make no mistake if we put the inner points of the trajectory into\nthe ensemble. We can write:\nN\nN Z\nN\n1 X\n1 X\n1 X\nO(Ut )dt = lim\nOi = lim\nOi,i+1\n(3.8)\nhOi = lim\nN \u2192\u221e N\nN \u2192\u221e N\nN \u2192\u221e N\ni\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nwhere t is the microcanonical time, Ut is the gauge configuration at time t, the i subscript\nat the integral means that the integration goes for the ith trajectory, and Oi,i+1 is thus\nthe average of the operator O along this trajectory. In the case of an observable, which\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fcontains a \u03b4-function, like those in eq. (3.6) or in eq. (3.7) this reads:\nZ\nOi,i+1 = dt o(Ut ) \u03b4 (\u03bb0 (Ut )) ,\n\n(3.9)\n\ni\n\nwhere it is indicated, that the \u03b4-function depends on the gauge configuration only through\nthe smallest absolute value eigenvalue \u03bb0 of HW . If the variable of integration is changed\nfrom t to \u03bb0 , we get:\nZ\nX dt\nOi,i+1 = d\u03bb0\no(Utj )\u03b4(\u03bb0 ).\n(3.10)\nd\u03bb0 tj ,\u03bb0 (Ut )=0\nj\n\nj\n\nWe can go further by determining the time derivative of the smallest eigenvalue:\nd\u03bb0\n\u2202HW dU\n= h0|tr\n|0i\ndt\n\u2202U T dt\n\n(3.11)\n\nwhere, again |0i is the eigenvector belonging to \u03bb0 . The trace and transpose operations\nare meant to be in color space. Recognizing, that with our previous notation\ndU\n= pU\ndt\n\nand h0|U\n\n\u2202HW\n|0i = n\n\u2202U T\n\nyields\nd\u03bb0\n= hn, pi,\ndt\n\n1\ndt\n=\n,\nd\u03bb0\n|hn, pi|\n\nN\n1 XX\n1\nhOi = lim\no(Utj )\nN \u2192\u221e N\n|hn, ptj i|\ni=1\n\nj\n\n(3.12)\n(3.13)\n\ntj ,\u03bb0 (Utj )=0\n\nIf we put it simple, the above formula says, that since the integration is in microcanonical\ntime, the angle and velocity by which the trajectory hits the boundary has to be taken\ninto account.\nLet us turn back to the case, when the integration of the equations of motion can\nbe done only with finite step size integrator. The leap-frog procedure has O(\u01eb3 ) error\nper microcanonical step, which after 1/\u01eb steps makes the trajectory differ by O(\u01eb2 ) from\nthe exact trajectory. If we can guarantee, that the modification of the trajectory at the\nboundary also violates the equations of motions only upto O(\u01eb2 ), then in the final results\n\u221a\nthe errors will be proportional with O( N \u01eb2 ). The original reflection algorithm in [10]\nhas O(\u01eb) errors, later it was improved to O(\u01eb2 ) in [13]. In the Appendix we propose a\ndifferent reflection procedure and prove that it is reversible, area-preserving and conserves\nthe energy upto O(\u01eb2 ).\n\n4. Numerical results\nIn the previous section we described a new method, to solve the topological sector changing\nproblem of pseudofermionic HMC simulation. We describe here the details of the simulations, and finally give the topological susceptibility in physical units measured on 84 and\n83 \u00d7 16 lattices.\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fSimulations were done using unit length trajectories, separated by momentum and\npseudofermion refreshments. The system was confined to a fixed topological sector in each\nrun, we reflected the trajectories whenever they reached a sector boundary. The end points\nof the trajectories obviously follow the exact distribution in a given sector, usual quantities\ncan be measured on them. When calculating the ratio of sectors using eq. (3.5) or eq.\n(3.6) or eq. (3.7) we integrated along the trajectories, this quantity will be burdened by a\nstep size error.\n\nFigure 2: Left panel: a typical optimization procedure of the lower limit (x) on \u2206S in the\nformula (3.6). The statistical error of the ratio Z1 /Z0 shows a minimum as the function of x, which\nis considered as the optimal value. Right panel: Bare mass dependence of topological susceptibility\nusing three different methods on 64 lattices. The points corresponding to the same mass were\nslightly shifted vertically for clarity. Result based on our new technique and eq. (3.6) is on the\nleft, based on eq. (3.7) is in the middle, the standard pseudofermionic HMC is on the right. The\nsimulation parameters are from [20]\n\nIn case of large enough statistics the value of ZQ+1 /ZQ should be the same, independently which of the three formula (3.5, 3.6, 3.7) was used to calculate it. We omit eq. (3.5)\nin the following, since it is hard to give a reliable error estimate on the expectation value of\nexp(\u2212\u2206S), if \u2206S can be arbitrary negative number. Eq. (3.6) still measures exp(\u2212\u2206S),\nbut with a lower limit (x) on \u2206S. Smaller limit yields a smaller and more reliable error,\nhowever the statistics is decreased at the same time. One can tune the value of x, so that\nthe statistical error takes its minimum. A result of a typical optimum search can be seen\non the left panel of Fig. 2. The optimal value can be compared to the one obtained from\neq. (3.7). On the right panel of Fig. 2 the two new topological susceptibilities and the\none calculated by using traditional pseudofermionic HMC [20] are shown. The agreement\nis perfect.\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\fTo measure the topological susceptibility on\nm\nr0\nm\u03c0\nLm\u03c0\nlattices we generated configurations with tree0.03 3.52(13) 0.29(11)\n2.4\nlevel Symanzik improved gauge action (\u03b2 = 4.15\n0.1\n3.17(5)\n0.53(4)\n4.3\ngauge coupling) and 2 step stout smeared overlap\n0.2\n2.89(2)\n0.74(6)\n5.9\nkernel (\u03c1 = 0.15 smearing parameter, the kernel\n0.3\n2.88(6)\n0.99(8)\n7.9\nwas the standard Wilson matrix with m0 = 1.3).\nWe performed runs in sectors Q = 0 . . . 3 (based Table 1: Sommer-scale, pion mass and\n3\non the measured Z3 /Z2 we can conclude, that the pion mass times box size on 8 \u00d716 lattices.\ncontribution of Q \u2265 4 sectors are small compared\nto statistical uncertainties). For the negatively charged sectors we used the Q \u2192 \u2212Q\nsymmetry of the partition function. The bare masses were m = 0.03, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3,\nat each mass approximately 1000 trajectories were collected. The average number of the\ntopological sector boundary hittings was around 1.5 per trajectory. We calculated the ratio\nof sectors using eq. (3.6) and eq. (3.7). The result for the topological susceptibility can be\nseen on Fig. 3. It is nicely suppressed for the smallest mass. To convert it into physical\nunits, we measured the static potential and the pion mass on 83 \u00d7 16 lattices (Table 1).\nSince our statistics was quite small on these asymmetric lattices, the errors are large. Note,\nthat in order to get the mass-dimension 4 topological susceptibility in physical units, one\nhas to make very precise scale measurements.\n84\n\nFigure 3: Topological susceptibility as the function of quark mass on 84 lattices in lattice units\n(left), and in physical units as the function of pion mass (right). Scale fixing and mass measurements\nwere done on 83 \u00d7 16. The error bars on the right plot do not contain the errors of scale fixing. The\nline is the leading order chiral behavior in the continuum.\n\nWhen interpreting the results, one should keep in mind, that the volume is small, and\nthe lattice spacing is large. Note however, that smeared kernel overlap actions show nice\nscaling behavior and good locality properties already at moderate lattice spacings [21, 22].\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\f5. Conclusions\nIn this paper we studied the problem of topological sector changing in dynamical overlap\nsimulations. The origin of the unexpectedly large autocorrelation time for the topological\ncharge is connected to pseudofermions, which approximate the fermion determinant. The\npseudofermionic action overestimates the size of the discontinuity in the fermion determinant at the topological sector boundary, so the system cannot enter easily to a new\ntopological sector. This happens even if the use of the exact determinant favored a transition. (The discontinuity of the exact determinant can be calculated in a rather inexpensive\nway.)\nWe developed a new method, which circumvents the problem of topological sector\nchanging. It confines the system to fixed topological sectors (by always reflecting the HMC\ntrajectories from the topological sector boundaries). Thus overestimating the discontinuity of the determinant due to pseudofermions will not effect the determination of topology\nrelated quantities. The relative weight of two topological sector is obtained by measuring\nappropriate operators on the common boundary surface. The measurement of such operators can be carried out by extending the usual HMC measurement method, however an\nO(\u01eb2 ) extrapolation in HMC step size is required.\nThe new method was tested on 64 lattices, where previous conventional HMC results\nwere available. The old and new results were consistent. We also measured the topological\nsusceptibility on 84 lattices with an improved overlap fermion and gauge action, furthermore\nsimulations were done on 83 \u00d7 16 lattices to convert the lattice results into physical units.\nAcknowledgments:\nUseful comments on the manuscript from A.

Until the boundary the trajectory is evolved by the usual\nleapfrog procedure. An elementary leapfrog step can be written in the following symbolic\nway:\nP (\u01eb/2)U (\u01eb)P (\u01eb/2),\n(5.1)\nwhere U (\u01eb) and P (\u01eb) are the operators updating the links (u) and the momenta (p):\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u2202\nU (\u01eb) : u \u2192 exp(\u01ebp)u,\nP (\u01eb) : p \u2192 p \u2212 \u01ebA u\n(Sg + Spf ) ,\n\u2202u\nwhere in the force term the A operator projects onto traceless, antihermitian matrices (in\ncolor indices). Now we split the evolution of the links into two parts:\nP (\u01eb/2)U (\u01eb/2) * U (\u01eb/2)P (\u01eb/2).\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n(5.2)\n\n\fConsider that the boundary would be crossed during one of the evolutions of the links in\neq. (5.2). Then replace the original leapfrog with the following:\nP (\u01eb/2)U (\u01eb/2) * U (\u01ebc )P (\u01ebc )RP (\u01ebc )U (\u01ebc ) * U (\u01eb/2)P (\u01eb/2),\nwhere R is simply the reflection of the momenta (eq. (2.5)). \u01ebc is the time to reach the\nboundary surface measured from the midpoint of the leapfrog. Thus if the crossing would\nhappen in the first evolution then \u01ebc < 0, if in the second, then \u01ebc > 0. The reversibility can\nbe checked easily, for the energy conservation we note that both U (\u01eb)P (\u01eb) and P (\u01eb)U (\u01eb)\nconserves the energy upto O(\u01eb2 ). If the evolution time does not depend on the variables,\nthen both U (\u01eb) and P (\u01eb) are area conserving. The only problem arises due to the link and\nmomenta dependence of \u01ebc . We will now show that the combined effect of the \u01ebc updates\nU (\u01ebc )P (\u01ebc )RP (\u01ebc )U (\u01ebc )\n\n(5.3)\n\nis still area preserving.\nFor simplicity we will not carry out here the computation using the SU (3) structure,\nbut only for a k-dimensional Euclidean vectorspace (the q coordinates are k-component\nvectors). All features of the proof are also present in this simpler case. We have to\ncalculate the Jacobian of the following transformation\nq \u2032 (q, p) = q + \u01ebc p + \u01ebc p\u2032\n\np\u2032 (q, p) = Rp + h.\n\nRab = \u03b4ab \u2212 2na nb is the reflection operator (a, b = 1 . . . k), where na is the normal vector\nof the surface. h can be expressed as h = \u2212\u01ebc F \u2212 \u01ebc RF , where F is the force on the wall\n(interpreted in the sector into which we reflect back the trajectory). Since h is measured\non the wall, its q and p derivatives satisfy \u2202h/\u2202p = \u01ebc \u2202h/\u2202q (see [10]). Furthermore h is\northogonal to n ((nh) = 0). For the q derivative of p\u2032 we introduce the matrix Zab , which\ncontains the derivatives of the normal vector and h:\n\u2202p\u2032a\n= Zab .\n\u2202qb\nUsing that n and h are functions of the wall coordinates, \u01ebc Z will appear in the p derivative\nof p\u2032 :\n\u2202p\u2032a\n= Rab + \u01ebc Zab .\n\u2202pb\nThe partial derivatives of q \u2032 are:\n\u2202qa\u2032\n\u2202\u01ebc\n\u2202p\u2032\n= \u03b4ab + (pa + p\u2032a )\n+ \u01ebc a ,\n\u2202qb\n\u2202qb\n\u2202qb\n\u2032\n\u2202\u01ebc\n\u2202p\u2032\n\u2202qa\n= \u01ebc \u03b4ab + (pa + p\u2032a )\n+ \u01ebc a .\n\u2202pb\n\u2202pb\n\u2202pb\nWith the help of the following identities (see [10]):\n\u2202\u01ebc\nna\n,\n= \u2212\u01ebc\n\u2202pa\n(np)\n\nna\n\u2202\u01ebc\n=\u2212\n\u2202qa\n(np)\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\fthe Jacobian can be written in a hypermatrix form (x \u25e6 y has components xa yb ):\n!\n!\n!\n!\n\u2202q \u2032 \u2202q \u2032\n2\n1\n1\n\u22122\u01eb\nQ\n\u01eb\n\u01eb\n1\n\u01eb\nc\nc\nc\nc\n\u2202q \u2202p\nJ = \u2202p\n=\n\u2212\n\u2297 Z.\n\u2297 [(p + p\u2032 ) \u25e6 n] +\n\u2032 \u2202p\u2032\n(np)\n0\nR\n1\n\u01eb\n0\n0\nc\n\u2202q \u2202p\nQ is the projector to the subspace orthogonal to n (Q = 1 \u2212 n \u25e6 n).

The determinant\nof J2 will be unity due to the orthogonality of p + p\u2032 = p + Rp + h = \u22122Qp + h and n.\nTherefore det J = \u22121, which shows that the transformation (5.3) preserves the area.\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\f"}
