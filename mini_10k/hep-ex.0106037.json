The University of Oxford has started the design\nand development of the new experiment ADLER (Airborne\nDetector for Low Energy Rays). This apparatus will measure\nthe cosmic-ray muon flux at an altitude of 10 \u2013 13 km. The\ndetector should be flown by aircrafts on transatlantic routes\ncrossing the magnetic equator to investigate the flux at different geomagnetic latitudes. The goal of the experiment is\nto obtain better constraints on the low energy atmospheric\nneutrino flux and the results will be of importance to the atmospheric neutrino anomaly.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nOne of the most exciting results to emerge in particle physics\nin the last decade is the apparent deficit of atmospheric muon\nneutrinos reported by underground experiments (Fukuda et\nal., 1998; Ambrosio et al., 1998; Allison et al., 1998). The\nlatest results from the Japanese Super-Kamiokande experiment provide strong evidence for a flavour oscillation of\nmuon neutrinos into tau neutrinos, but the precision is limited by uncertainties in the predicted flux of atmospheric neutrinos with energies less than 1 GeV. The neutrinos are end\nproduct of a cascade of particles in the atmosphere: Incident\ncosmic rays (CR) produce light mesons in nuclear collisions\nwith air molecules. Charged pions decay to muons and neutrinos; below 2.5 GeV the majority of muons will themselves\ndecay to electrons or positrons and neutrinos. Charged kaons\nshow a similar decay chain:\nACR + AAir\n\n\u2192\n\n\u03c0 \u00b1 , \u03c0 0 , K \u00b1 , other hadrons\n\n\u03c0\u00b1 , K \u00b1\n\n\u2192\n\n\u03bc\u00b1 + \u03bd \u03bc\n\n\u03bc\u00b1\n\n\u2192\n\ne \u00b1 + \u03bde + \u03bd\u03bc\n\n(\u2212)\n\n(\u2212)\n\n(\u2212)\n\nThe uncertainties of present Monte Carlo calculations performed by the Bartol group (Barr et al., 1989; Agrawal et\nCorrespondence to:\nDr Carsten Patrick Achenbach\n(p.achenbach@physics.ox.ac.uk)\n\nal., 1996) and by Honda, Kajita, Kasahara and Midorikawa\n(Honda et al., 1990) can be reduced by measuring the flux\nof low-energy muons. Those muons are strongly correlated\nto neutrinos but much easier to detect. While muon measurements at ground level are widely reported in the literature, there have been very few attempts to measure the muon\nflux as a function of altitude and latitude. An early experiment performed by Conversi (1950) gave the first information about muons at aircraft altitudes. The deployment of\nballoon-borne detectors since 1989 allowed more accurate\nmeasurements during their ascent in the atmosphere, but the\nmain difficulty in such experiments remains the fixed location and the altitude of the detectors is continuously varying.\nA compilation of reported muon flux results on balloon measurements can be found in Ambriola et al., 2000.\nThis paper reports on the design of a compact and mobile\napparatus to be flown by an aircraft. The method employed\nfor distinguishing muons from other ionising particles is the\nobservation of delayed coincidences in an active absorber together with anti-coincidences in surrounding veto-counters.\nThe detector concept is similar to Conversi's, although scintillators are used in place of Geiger-M\u00fcller tubes.\n\n2 Instrument description\nThe challenge is to construct a detector which is sufficiently\nrugged, light and low powered to be carried on an aircraft.\nIndividual detector parts will be mounted in an steel frame\nand will be supported by strong wings in the four corners.\nThe height of the frame will be 60 cm and its cross-section 85\n\u00d7 85 cm2 . The total weight including the inactive absorbers\nis about 350 kg.\nFig. 1 presents a schematic cross-sectional view of the\nmain components. The detector will consist of three similar scintillator hodoscopes. Each hodoscope is composed\nof two planes of plastic scintillator bars. For the first one\n(S1) there are 16 strips of length 56 cm in each layer, while\n8 strips of length 28 cm make up the second (S2) and third\n\n\f2\n\nFig. 1. Schematic drawing of the\nADLER detector with a trapezoidal active absorber. Different types of particle\ntracks are distinguished by the timing of\nthe detector response. Tracks of type\n1 originate from high energy muons,\ntype 2 tracks originate from low energy\nmuons which have stopped in the active\nabsorber, type 3 tracks originate from\nmuons which have stopped in the third\ntrigger hodoscope and the decay electrons of type 4 tracks produce additional\nsignals in one of the veto-counters and\nleave the active volume.\n\n(S3). All strips are 3.5 cm wide by 2 cm thick. The maximum detectable zenith angle is defined by the hodoscopes\nS1 and S3 and amounts to 53.6\u25e6. The opening angle and\nthe active areas define the geometrical acceptance but muons\nwith larger angles can scatter into the acceptance region.\nTwo blocks of lead (30 cm length and width) are stacked\nbetween the scintillators. The bottom part of the detector\nconsists of an active absorber. The shape of the active absorber is a double trapezoid with a cross-section of 30 \u00d7\n30 cm2 at top and bottom and a cross-section of 62 \u00d7 62 cm2\nin the middle. Also different shapes like double cones or\nrectangular pyramids have been investigated. The use of liquid scintillator as the active detector element, in conjunction with wavelength-shifting fibres for light collection and\ntransmission, is well suited for such an experiment. The\nanticipated commercial liquid scintillator1 BC-517 L contains about 30% pseudocumene, has a light yield of 39% anthracene and a flash point of 102\u25e6 Celsius. A volume of 60\nlitres will be contained in a single aluminium container segmented by optical separators. Furthermore it is chemically\ncompatible with the blue to green wavelength-shifting fibre1\nBC-91 A (Young et al., 1993). Fibres of 1.2 mm diameter\nwill be used in the shape of Archimedes' spirals inside the\ntank with an equal distance of 4 cm between adjacent turns.\nThe signals of the scintillators will be read out by the optical fibres to five small (3 \u00d7 3 cm) Hamamatsu multi-anode\nM16 (R5900) photomultiplier tubes operated at voltages of\nabout 1000 V. The total number of analogue channels is 96.\nThe signal processing will be done by simple, low-powered\nelectronics and a data acquisition system based on laptop-PC.\nThe trigger mode will be a coincidence of signals from the\nthree scintillator hodoscopes which can be interpreted as a\ncharged track, together with an anti-coincidence of the veto1\n\nBicron, Newbury, OH, USA.\n\ncounters. The timing of subsequent hits in the active elements is recorded in a 16 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 16 FIFO using a 40 MHz\nclock to keep the rate of false coincidences low. The time\ndifference between trigger signal and delayed signal in measures the decay time of the muon. The background to the decay curve can be restricted by requiring an anti-coincidence\nof the veto-counters with the delayed signal if the reconstructed track is of type 2, see Fig. 1. The power consumption\nis about 30 W for the electronics and 20 \u2013 30 W for the laptop. At the present stage of the experiment the design of the\nelectronics is not yet finished. The position and altitude of\nthe aircraft at any time could be obtained from mobile Global\nPositioning System (GPS) equipment or the aircraft log.\n\n3 Muon charge ratio considerations\nThe flux ratio r = N\u03bc+ /N\u03bc\u2212 of positive to negative muons\nprovides important information on the interactions of the primary cosmic rays with nuclei in the atmosphere. The positive\nexcess is approximately 1.25 in the low energy range. Most\nof the previous measurements have been carried out using\nmagnetic deflection to determine the muon charge with simultaneous determination of the energy.\nThe principle of the ADLER measurement is based on the\ncapture of negative muons according to the reaction \u03bc\u2212 +\np \u2192 n + \u03bd\u03bc . Practically the entire energy liberated in this\nprocess is carried off by the neutrino and no signal will be\nproduced in the detector. As a result the mean negative muon\nlifetime becomes 1/\u03c4 = \u039bc + 1/\u03c40 where \u039bc is the capture probability and \u03c40 the decay lifetime for a free muon.\nAt Z = 11 \u2212 12 the capture probability is almost equal to\nthe decay probability, for iron (Z = 26) it is 90% of the total disappearance probability. For that reason the active absorber is designed flexible, making measurements with dif-\n\n\fTrack Length in Lead [cm]\n\n3\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n0.3\n\n0.35\n\n0.4\n\n0.45\n\n0.5\n\nMuon Momentum [GeV/c]\nFig. 2. Histogram of muon track lengths in lead versus muon momentum. Vertical muons travel through 15 cm of lead, equivalent to\n26 radiation lengths.\n\nferent absorbers (aluminium, steel, scintillator) possible. It\ncould consist of horizontal partitions with half of the mass\nmade of thin (1 mm) plates and the other half made of liquid\nscintillator cells. In the case of steel plates the total fraction\nof decaying muons will be 55%. Thus, the determination of\nthe muon charge ratio will be achievable from a comparison\nof total count rates. Alternatively it can be extracted from the\nmeasured decay curve, which is a superposition of the different lifetimes of negative muons in liquid scintillator and the\nabsorber material and of positive muons.\n\n4\n\nMuon flux considerations\n\nThe mixed radiation field induced by cosmic rays consists of\na broad spectrum of different charged particles with varying\nmomentum. The expected composition at 14 km height (atmospheric depth \u2248 200 g/cm2 ) is 60% soft electrons, 30%\nprotons, 10% penetrating muons, 1% penetrating electrons\nand 0.1% pions. The momentum acceptance and detection\nefficiencies have been studied carefully using the GEANT 3.21\nMonte Carlo code. The geometrical set-up used was based\non the construction drawings. The total amount of material\nabove the active absorber amounts to 26 radiation lengths\ncorresponding to about one nuclear interaction length. This\nwill provide a considerable shielding of the lower scintillators from soft electrons and gamma-rays. Fig. 4 shows a histogram of simulated muon track lengths in the lead blocks of\nADLER versus muon momentum.\nThe most interesting muons are those created with energies around E\u03bc \u2248 2E\u03bd and the most important range of neutrino energy is E\u03bd \u2248 0.1 \u2212 10 GeV. The mean energy loss\n\nFig. 3. Acceptance curves of the ADLER detector. The event\nrates are encoded as follows: dashed = trigger (S1 S2 S3 ); dotdashed = muon signals (S1 S2 S3 A); dot-dot-dashed = signals in\nveto-counters (S1 S2 S3 V ); solid = stopped muons; long dashes =\nmuon decay signals in absorber (S1 S2 S3 AV DA ); short dashes =\nmuon decay signals in veto-counters (S1 S2 S3 VADV ).\n\nof vertical minimal ionising muons will be about 40 MeV in\nthe scintillators and 187 MeV in the lead blocks. In Fig. 2\nthe acceptance curves are plotted versus muon momentum.\nDifferent detector signals have been calculated: Muons with\nmomentum above 300 MeV/c will trigger the data acquisition (dashed line). The veto-counters will give a signal (dotdot-dashed line) for penetrating muons. The rate of muons\nwith identified decays is given by the coincidence requirements and is shown by the long dashed curve. This rate\nhas to be compared with the total rate of stopped muons in\nthe simulation (solid line). The FWHM of the acceptance\ncurve for identified muons is 61 MeV/c corresponding to\nan effective momentum width of 28 MeV/c for the nominal geometrical factor of 2088 cm2 sr. This factor has been\ncalculated by means of two independent codes and allows\nto estimate the expected flux of muons of one charge for a\ngiven geomagnetic latitude. Assuming a flux of 0.01 \u03bc/(cm2\nsr s GeV/c) at a geomagnetic cut-off of 4.5 GV gives a count\nrate of 0.6 Hz or 2,200 counts per hour. A measurement with\n3% statistical error can be performed in about 1/2 h. During\nthis time a south-going flight covers a geomagnetic latitude\ndifference of 4\u25e6 . Those numbers lead to the expected count\nrates listed in Table 1.\nFig. 3 shows the corresponding efficiency curves, where\nthe upper plot refers to count rates normalized to the trigger\nrate and the lower plot refers to count rates normalized to the\nrate of stopped muons. The efficiency of detecting a stopped\nmuon is about 90%. In addition, 20% of the decay electrons\n\n\f4\nTable 1. Expected count rates in the detector components.

At present,\nthe confidence in the IGRF (International Geomagnetic Reference Field) models is strong. However, a measurement\nof the muon flux at different geomagnetic latitudes \u03bb is desirable. The flight paths investigated involve transatlantic\nroutes. The possible latitude band extends from \u223c 55\u25e6 N\nto \u223c 35\u25e6 S. The majority of commercial flights have cruising\naltitudes from 11 to 13 km.\nThe whole structure of the detector must tolerate acceleration in each direction to meet the regulations of the aircraft.\nIn the vertical and horizontal directions perpendicular to the\naircraft axis the limits of maximum acceleration are at 3g.\nAlong the aircraft axis the limit is at 9g. Finite element analysis has been performed during the design of the detector to\nmeet those demands.\n6 Conclusions\nThe ADLER detector is a small and compact apparatus for\nmeasuring the flux of atmospheric muons as a function of the\ngeomagnetic coordinates. The momentum acceptance was\nchosen to be relevant to the atmospheric neutrino anomaly.\nThe muon charge ratio will be determined by a comparison of\nthe \u03bc\u2212 lifetimes in different absorbers. The results will lead\nto a better understanding of present and future atmospheric\nneutrino experiments. Furthermore, the measurements will\nprovide an important check of the new 3-dimensional atmospheric neutrino flux calculations being performed at Oxford.\nReferences\n\nFig. 4. Efficiency curves of the ADLER detector. The efficiencies are encoded as follows in the upper plot: solid = stopped\nmuons per trigger; dots = muon decay signals in absorber per trigger (S1 S2 S3 AV DA ); long dashes = muon decay signals in vetocounters per trigger (S1 S2 S3 V ADV ); short dashes = muon decay signals in veto-counters only per trigger (S1 S2 S3 V ADA DV );\nin the lower plot: solid = muon decay signals per stopped muon\n(S1 S2 S3 AV D); dots = muon decay signals in absorber per stopped\nmuon (S1 S2 S3 AV DA ); long dashes = muon decay signals in vetocounters per stopped muon (S1 S2 S3 AV DV ).\n\nare detected in the veto-counters providing a redundancy in\nthe data analysis which can be used to reduce backgrounds.\n\nAgrawal, V. et al., Atmospheric neutrino flux above 1 GeV, Phys.\nRev., D53, 1314\u20131323, 1996.\nAllison, W.W.M. et al.
