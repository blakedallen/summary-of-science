The asymmetry\n\u03c3R \u2212 \u03c3L\n,\n(1)\nARL =\n\u03c3R + \u03c3L\nwith \u03c3R,L corresponding to the scattering cross-section with positive and negative helicity\nelectrons respectively, is an excellent probe of the parity-violating electroweak interactions\nin the SM. The results of measuring this asymmetry in the early experiments at SLAC\nled to the correct description of neutral weak interactions well before the discovery of the\nZ boson at CERN and provided a measurement of the weak mixing angle sin2 \u03b8W . Since\nthen parity-violating electron scattering from various targets has been studied at JLab [4\u20137],\nMIT/Bates [8, 9], Mainz [10, 11], and SLAC[12] as a tool for probing physics beyond the\nSM and hadronic structure.\nCurrently, an active program is underway at JLab to continue these studies with a new\nlevel of precision. The Q-Weak experiment [13], which will measure the weak charge of\nthe proton at low electron momentum transfer (Q2 ), is expected to determine sin2 \u03b8W to\n0.3% precision, making it the most precise test of the running of the weak mixing angle to\ndate. Furthermore, the recently approved 12 GeV upgrade of CEBAF at JLab, expected\nto be completed by 2014, aims to begin the next generation Moller and electron-deuteron\nscattering experiments. The SOLID proposal [14] for precision parity-violating electrondeuteron scattering, approved as part of the 12 GeV upgrade, will measure ARL over a wide\nkinematic range in Q2 and Bjorken-x to within 1% at each kinematic point. In addition,\none high-precision PVDIS experiment with deuterium has completed data taking at selected\nkinematic points with the 6 GeV [15] beam and another is approved to run at the 12 GeV [16]\nbeam. These present and prospective high-precision experimental measurements present new\nchallenges for their theoretical interpretation. In particular, substantial uncertainties in the\ntheoretical interpretation of the deep inelastic asymmetries will remain unless various effects\ncontributing to the asymmetry such as new physics beyond the SM, sea quark distributions,\nCharge Symmetry Violation (CSV), and higher twist contributions are well understood and\ndisentangled from each other. Addressing one aspect of these issues is the subject of this\npaper.\nThe theoretical interpretation of the deuterium asymmetry can be facilitated by expressing it in the following form\n!\"\n#\n\u03b3Z\n\u03b3Z\ne\nF\ng\nF\nGF Q2\n1\n3\nV\nARL = \u2212 \u221a\ngAe Y1 \u03b3 +\nY3 \u03b3 .\n(2)\nF1\n2\nF1\n4 2\u03c0\u03b1\nHere, gVe (gAe ) are the vector (axial vector) couplings of the Z-boson to the electron; F1\u03b3 , F1\u03b3Z ,\nand F3\u03b3Z are the structure functions arising, respectively, from hadronic matrix elements of\n\n\f3\nthe vector electromagnetic (EM) current, interference of the vector EM and vector weak\nneutral current (WNC), and interference of the vector EM current and axial vector WNC;\nand Y1,3 are functions of kinematic variables and the ratios R\u03b3 and R\u03b3Z of longitudinal\nand transverse cross sections for purely EM and WNC-EM vector current interference cross\nsections. In the SM, at leading twist and in the absence of CSV effects, the Y1 term in Eq.(2)\nis independent of y and depends only on gAe and the vector current coupling of the Z-boson\nto quarks [3]. Since gVe = \u22121 + 4 sin2 \u03b8W \u223c \u22120.1, the Y1 -term dominates the asymmetry,\nmaking its scrutiny particularly important for the interpretation of the Jefferson Lab PVDIS\nprogram.\nConsiderable theoretical effort has been devoted to disentangling the various contributions to the asymmetry. The effect of twist-four contributions to the asymmetry was first\nconsidered in papers by Bjorken and Wolfenstein [17, 18] more than thirty years ago, where\nit was shown to arise in the dominant axial electron coupling term from a single, non-local\nfour-quark operator in the limit of good isospin, negligible sea-quark and CSV effects, and\nup to corrections in \u03b1s (Q2 ). Quantitative estimates of twist-four effects were first obtained\nin [19] where the contribution of the spin-two operators was estimated using the MIT Bag\nModel. This analysis was extended in [20] to include corrections to the F3\u03b3Z structure function. More recently, higher twist effects to the asymmetry were estimated by the authors\nof Ref. [21], who considered the possibility that R\u03b3 and R\u03b3Z receive substantially different contributions from finite-Q2 effects. These authors argued that such a difference could\nintroduce hadronic uncertainties that might impede the extraction of CSV effects from ARL .\nIn this paper, we draw on the observations of [17, 18] that the twist-four contribution to\nthe Y1 term in ARL for deuterium, given in Eq. (2), arises from a single four-quark operator\ninvolving up- and down-quark fields\n1\n\u03bc\u03bd\nOud\n(x) = [\u016b(x)\u03b3 \u03bc u(x)d(0)\u03b3 \u03bd d(0) + (u \u2194 d)]\n2\n\n(3)\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\nto revisit the analysis of Ref. [21]. Noting that the contribution of Oud\n(x) to the electroweak\nstructure functions satisfies the Callan-Gross relation at leading order in the strong coupling,\nwe find that\n\nR\u03b3Z = R\u03b3\n\nand\n\nY1 = 1,\n\n(4)\n\nat twist-four up to perturbative corrections. Consequently, all twist-four effects entering the\ndominant term in the asymmetry reside in the ratio F1\u03b3Z /F1\u03b3 .\nUsing the power law dependence in Q2 of the twist-four effects to the Y1 -term it may be\npossible, with the precision and the wide kinematic range of the PVDIS program at JLab\nand its possible extension at an electron-ion collider [22] , to disentangle twist-four effects\nfrom CSV effects depending on their relative overall sizes. To provide theoretical guidance\nfor such a program, we utilize the MIT Bag Model[23] to estimate the size and variation of\nthe twist-four contribution with Bjorken-x and Q2 . These estimates extend the earlier work\n\n\f4\nof Ref. [20] by allowing for the x-dependences of the twist-two and twist-four contributions\n\u03b3(\u03b3Z)\nto F1\nto differ. We find that if the MIT Bag Model reasonably estimates the magnitude\n\u03bc\u03bd\nof the twist-four contribution from Oud\n(x), the impact on the asymmetry would likely be\ntoo small to be extracted without further improvements in experimental precision. In this\ncase, however, the planned PVDIS experiments could in principle provide a theoretically\nclean probe of possible contributions from CSV and/or physics beyond the SM. Conversely,\nthe observation of significant power corrections to the Y1 term would signal the presence\nof relatively large and theoretically interesting quark-quark correlation contributions to the\nelectroweak structure functions.\nOur analysis leading to these conclusions is organized in the remainder of the paper as\nfollows. In Section II, we provide an overview of the structure of the deuterium asymmetry,\nsetting the context for our analysis of the twist-four contributions in Section III. In Section\nIV we give our MIT Bag Model estimates and compare these with recent parameterizations of\nCSV contributions as well as possible effects from \"new physics\" in Section V. We summarize\nour conclusions in Section VI. In appendix A, we also recast the argument of [24\u201326] in the\nlanguage of the Soft-Collinear Effective Theory(SCET) [27\u201329] that shows manifestly that\nthe twist-four matrix element contributing to the Y1 -term satisfies the Callan-Gross relation\nat tree level in the matching.\nII.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nBefore presenting the formalism and derivation of our results, we provide an overview of\nthe structure of the deuterium asymmetry and the context for the higher twist contributions.

The quantities \u03c1\u0302N C , \u03ba\u0302, and \u03bb\u0302qj encode\nthe effects of electroweak radiative corrections and take on the values one, one, and zero,\nrespectively, at tree-level, leading to\n1 4\ntree\n= \u2212 + sin2 \u03b8W ,\nC1u\n2 3\n1\ntree\nC2u\n= \u2212 + 2 sin2 \u03b8W ,\n2\n\n1 2 2\n\u2212 sin \u03b8W ,\n2 3\n1\n= \u2212 2 sin2 \u03b8W .\n2\n\ntree\n=\nC1d\ntree\nC2d\n\n(8)\n\n\f5\nThe reason for the high sensitivity of ARL to these interactions is that in the limit of\ngood isospin and negligible sea quark effects, all hadronic effects are known to cancel in the\nasymmetry at leading order in the twist expansion (corresponding to the parton model limit).\nThe resulting expression for the asymmetry, known as the Cahn-Gilman (CG) formula [3],\nis given at tree-level by1\n\u0001 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 y)2 i\n20 2 \u0001\nGF Q2 9 h\n2\n\u221a\n1\n\u2212\nsin\n\u03b8\n+\n1\n\u2212\n4\nsin\n\u03b8\n.\nARL\n=\n\u2212\nW\nW\nCG\n9\n1 + (1 \u2212 y)2\n2 2\u03c0\u03b1 10\n\n(9)\n\nHere y is the kinematic variable defined as\n2P * (` \u2212 `0 )\n,\n2P * `\n\n(10)\n\nGF Q2 9 h\n1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 y)2 i\n= \u2212 \u221a\n\u00e31 + \u00e32\n,\n1 + (1 \u2212 y)2\n2 2\u03c0\u03b1 10\n\n(11)\n\ny =\n\nwhere P\u03bc , `\u03bc , and `0\u03bc denote the four momenta of the deuteron, the incoming electron, and\nthe outgoing electron respectively. In the lab frame, one has y = (E \u2212 E 0 )/E where E and\nE 0 denote of the energies of the incoming and and outgoing electrons. The corrections to\nthis Cahn-Gilman formula can be parameterized by writing the asymmetry as\nARL\n\nwhere the parameters \u00e3j (j = 1, 2) are schematically written as\n\u0002\n\u0003\n2\n\u00e3j = \u2212 (2Cju \u2212 Cjd ) 1 + Rj (new) + Rj (sea) + Rj (CSV) + Rj (TMC) + Rj (HT) (12)\n3\nand Rj (new), Rj (sea), Rj (CSV), Rj (TMC), and Rj (HT) denote respectively corrections\narising from possible new physics beyond the SM, sea quark effects, CSV, target mass\ncorrections (TMC) [31, 32], and higher twist (HT) contributions. If one is interested in\nlooking for signals of new physics beyond the SM that can leave a footprint in the asymmetry\nvia the contributions R1,2 (new), it is crucial that all the SM electroweak and hadronic\ncorrections to the Cahn-Gilman formula in Eq. (12) are under theoretical and experimental\ncontrol. One can take an alternative viewpoint and instead view a precision measurement of\nARL as a probe of hadronic physics that modifies the Cahn-Gilman formula as in Eqs.(11)\nand (12).\nThe analysis of this paper is focused on the higher twist correction R1 (HT) that enters\nthe \u00e31 term of the asymmetry. The leading contribution to R1 (HT) appears at twist-four,\ngiving rise to a 1/Q2 power law dependence. In contrast, the leading contribution from\nR1 (TMC), which will also have a 1/Q2 power law contribution, will be suppressed relative\nto R1 (HT). The relative suppression of R1 (TMC) can be understood by noting that the\nderivation of the Cahn-Gilman formula is valid even for a finite target mass so that target\n1\n\nWe observe that the RHS of Eq.(4.89) of Ref. [30] should be multiplied by (-1).\n\n\f6\nmass corrections will always appear in conjunction with at least one of the already small\neffects that correct the Cahn-Gilman formula.\nGiven that all the remaining contributions to \u00e31 in Eq. (12) have at most a logarithmic\ndependence on Q2 , one can, in principle, make a clean extraction of R1 (HT) by studing the\nQ2 dependence of the \u00e31 term in the asymmetry. Similar statements can be made for the\nhigher twist effects R2 (HT) that contribute to the \u00e32 term of the asymmetry. However, the\nstudy of R1 (HT) is particularly interesting because the leading contribution to R1 (HT) that\narises at twist-four is given entirely by a single matrix element that characterizes quark-quark\ncorrelations in the deuteron as first observed in [17, 18]. This is in contrast to R2 (HT), which\nreceives contributions from several different twist-four matrix elements making it difficult\nto interpret the effect of correlations among quarks and gluons in terms of any one of the\nthese matrix elements.\nBefore giving the explicit expression for R1 (HT) that we derive below, we first review\nsome of the standard notation used in PVDIS pehenomenology. The general expression for\n\u03b3\n\u03b3Z\nthe asymmetry ARL is given in terms of the five structure functions F1,2\nand F1,2,3\ntakes the\nform [21]\n\u0010 G Q2 \u0011 g e 2xyF \u03b3Z \u2212 2\u00021 \u2212 1/y + xM \u0003F \u03b3Z \u0001 + g e x(2 \u2212 y)F \u03b3Z\nF\n1\n2\n3\nA\nE\n\u0002\n\u0003 V\u03b3\n.\n(13)\nARL = \u2212 \u221a\n2xyF1\u03b3 \u2212 2 1 \u2212 1/y + xM\nF\n4 2\u03c0\u03b1\n2\nE\nThis general expression reduces to the Cahn-Gilman formula when the leading twist and\nisospin limits are applied to structure functions and when sea quark and CSV effects are\n\u03b3Z\nignored. The F1,2\nand F3\u03b3Z structure functions arise from the interference of the electromagnetic current with the vector and axial part of the weak neutral current respectively.\nThe asymmetry is often parameterized in terms of the ratio of the longitudinal to transverse\nvirtual neutral vector boson cross-sections\n\u03b3(\u03b3Z)\n\nR\u03b3(\u03b3Z) \u2261\n\n\u03c3L\n\n\u03b3(\u03b3Z)\n\n\u03c3T\n\n\u03b3(\u03b3Z)\n\n= r2\n\nF2\n\n\u03b3(\u03b3Z)\n\n2xF1\n\n\u2212 1,\n\nr2 = 1 +\n\n4M 2 x2\n.\nQ2\n\n(14)\n\nIn terms of R\u03b3(\u03b3Z) the asymmetry in Eq.

(2) come purely from four-quark twist-four\noperators up to possible higher order perturbative mixing effects involving quark-gluon or\n\n\f9\npurely gluonic operators. This result was first pointed out in [17, 18]. Here we recast the\nargument in the more modern language, derive an explicit expression for the matrix element\nof the four-quark twist-four operator as a linear combination of the structure functions F1\u03b3\nand F1\u03b3Z , and provide a corresponding formula for the shift in the asymmetry, R1 (HT).\nMoreover, the matrix elements of four-quark twist-four operators are known [24, 25] to\nsatisfy the Callan-Gross relation. We exploit this property to show that Y1 = 1 up to twistfour and that the twist-four contribution in the Y1 term lies entirely in the factor F1\u03b3Z /F1\u03b3 .\nThis result implies that the Y1 term in Eq. (2) is in principle a relatively clean probe of\ntwist-four quark-quark correlations.\nFollowing the notation of Ref. [18], we start with an isospin decomposition of the electromagnetic current and the vector part of the WNC as\n1\n1\nJ\u03b3\u03bc = v\u03bc + s\u03bc \u2212 \u03bb\u03bc ,\n3\n3\n\u0003\n\u0002\n1 2\n2\nJZV \u03bc = 2 (1 \u2212 2 sin2 \u03b8W )v\u03bc \u2212 sin2 \u03b8W s\u03bc \u2212 ( \u2212 sin2 \u03b8W )\u03bb\u03bc ,\n3\n2 3\nwhere the isovector, isoscalar, and strange quark currents are, respectively,\n1\n \u0304 \u03bc d),\nv\u03bc = (\u016b\u03b3\u03bc u \u2212 d\u03b3\n2\n\n1\n \u0304 \u03bc d),\ns\u03bc = (\u016b\u03b3\u03bc u + d\u03b3\n2\n\n\u03bb\u03bc = s\u0304\u03b3\u03bc s\n\n(27)\n\n(28)\n\nand where we have omitted heavy quark contributions or simplicity (including them is\nstraightforward).

(50) is manifestly a four-quark twist-four matrix element while the\nRHS includes twist-2 contributions, two-quark twist-four contributions and four-quark twistfour contributions. This implies that the twist-2 and two-quark twist-four contributions on\nthe RHS cancel out. This allows us to write Eq. (50) as\ni\nh\nF1du = (9 \u2212 20 sin2 \u03b8W )F1\u03b3;4q \u2212 5F1\u03b3Z;4q ,\n(51)\nwhere the superscript 4q indicates that only the four-quark twist-four operator contributions\n\u03b3(\u03b3Z)\nto F1\nare kept. This makes the four-quark twist-four nature of the RHS in Eq. (50)\nmanifest.\nUsing Eqs.(48) and (51) in Eq.

To that end, we utilize the MIT Bag\nModel[23], following the analysis of Refs. [33, 34]. In principle, one may consider the use\n\u03bc\u03bd\n(x), such as QCD sum rules (see,\nof other models to estimate the matrix element of Oud\ne.g. Ref. [35] and references therein) or the instanton vacuum approximation[36] that have\nbeen applied more extensively to HT effects in polarized structure functions. In addition, a\nnonperturbative QCD computation would yield a result from first principles. To our knowledge, the particular nucleon matrix element of interest here has not been computed in any\nof these approaches, though some indications may be inferred from related calculations. For\nexample, the authors of Ref. [36] showed that in the instanton vacuum approximation, four\nquark matrix elements are suppressed relative to those of two-quark/gluon HT operators.\nThe authors of Ref. [37] have carried out a quenched lattice computation of the contribution\nof the isospin two, four quark operator to the pion structure function using Wilson fermions,\nand find that its scale is set by the square of the pion decay constant, F\u03c02 . These authors\nsuggested that the scale of the corresponding nucleon matrix elements would be set by mN\nrather than F\u03c0 , presumably leading to a larger value than in the constituent quark picture.\nIn both cases, only contributions to the leading moments were considered.\nIn what follows, we will use the MIT Bag Model to estimate not only the overall magnitude\nof the HT four quark contribution but also its dependence on xB . We note that the MIT\nBag Model was previously employed by the authors of Refs. [20, 38]. In applying their\ncomputation to the deuterium asymmetry, these authors assumed that the xB -dependence\nof the twist-two and twist-four contributions to the structure functions were similar and\nobtained the twist-four contributions by rescaling the twist-two contributions by the ratio\nof their leading moments. Under these approximations, they obtained\nR1 (HT) \u2248 \u2212\n\n5.7 \u00d7 10\u22123\nQ2 /(GeV)2\n\n.\n\n(62)\n\nIn what follows, we extend the analysis of Ref. [20] by allowing differences in the xB dependences of the twist-two and -four contributions to the structure functions. To this\nend, we compute a series of twist-four structure function moments, fit these moments to a\nparameterization in moment number N , and perform an inverse Mellin transform to obtain\nthe structure function. This procedure is subject to several uncertainties, including the\ntruncation of the tower of moments before carrying out the inverse Mellin transform and\nthe choice of parameterization to which they are fit. In addition, we have neglected the\nlogarithmic evolution of the moments from the hadronic scale to the Q2 of interest, as a\nfull computation of the anomalous dimension matrix \u2013 including the effects mixing between\nthe four-quark and twist-four quark-quark gluon and purely gluonic operators remains to be\n\n\f16\ncompleted. Nonetheless, we believe the computation described below provides a reasonable\nmodel estimate for the four-quark structure function relevant to R1 (HT). We find that the\nvalue of the structure function moments decreases rapidly with N , justifying the neglect\nof higher moments in the inversion, and that our results for the inverse Mellin transforms\ndo not vary appreciably as we change the parameterization used in fitting them. To the\nextent that the logarithmic Q2 evolution of the moments at these scales is gentle and that\nthe quark-quark correlations embodied in the MIT Bag Model capture the dominant twistfour physics, then the estimates described below and illustrated in Fig. 1 should provide a\nreasonable benchmark.\n\u03b3(\u03b3Z)\nThe four-quark twist-four contributions to F1\nare given by[24, 25]\nZ\nh\nxB \u039b 2 X\n\u03b3;4q\n2\ndxdydz\neq eq0 U1 (x, y, z) \u2206(x, y, z, xB ) + \u2206(y \u2212 x, y, y \u2212 z, xB )\nF1 (xB , Q ) =\n2 Q2 q,q0\n\u0001\n\u2212 \u2206(y \u2212 x, y, z, xB ) \u2212 \u2206(x, y, y \u2212 z, xB )\n\n+ eq eq0 U2 (x, y, z) \u2206(x, y, z, xB ) + \u2206(y \u2212 x, y, y \u2212 z, xB )\n\u0001i\n+ \u2206(y \u2212 x, y, z, xB ) + \u2206(x, y, y \u2212 z, xB ) ,\nZ\nh\nxB \u039b 2 X\n\u03b3Z;4q\n2\ndxdydz\neq gqV0 U1 (x, y, z) \u2206(x, y, z, xB ) + \u2206(y \u2212 x, y, y \u2212 z, xB )\nF1\n(xB , Q ) =\n2 Q2 q,q0\n\u0001\n\u2212 \u2206(y \u2212 x, y, z, xB ) \u2212 \u2206(x, y, y \u2212 z, xB )\n+ eq gqV0 U2 (x, y, z) \u2206(x, y, z, xB ) + \u2206(y \u2212 x, y, y \u2212 z, xB )\n\u0001i\n+ \u2206(y \u2212 x, y, z, xB ) + \u2206(x, y, y \u2212 z, xB ) ,\n\n(63)\nwhere eq and gqV are, respectively, the quark electric charge and vector coupling to the\nZ-boson with C1q = \u2212gAe gqV /2 and\n\u2206(x, y, z, xB ) =\n\n\u03b4(x \u2212 xB )\n\u03b4(y \u2212 xB )\n\u03b4(z \u2212 xB )\n+\n+\n(y \u2212 x)(z \u2212 x) (x \u2212 y)(z \u2212 y) (y \u2212 z)(x \u2212 z)\n\n,\n\n(64)\n\nand the deuteron four-quark operator matrix elements U1 and U2 are given by\nZ\ng2\nd\u03bb d\u03bc d\u03bd i\u03bbx i\u03bc(y\u2212x) i\u03bd(z\u2212y)\n0\nU1 (x, y, z) =\ne e\ne\nhD|\u03c8\u0304 q (0)n/ta \u03c8 q (\u03bdn)\u03c8\u0304(\u03bcn)n/ta \u03c8 q (\u03bbn)|Di, (65)\n2\n4\u039b\n2\u03c0 2\u03c0 2\u03c0\n2 Z\ng\nd\u03bb d\u03bc d\u03bd i\u03bbx i\u03bc(y\u2212x) i\u03bd(z\u2212y)\n0\nU2 (x, y, z) =\ne e\ne\nhD|\u03c8\u0304 q (0)n/\u03b35 ta \u03c8 q (\u03bdn)\u03c8\u0304(\u03bcn)n/\u03b35 ta \u03c8 q (\u03bbn)|Di,\n2\n4\u039b\n2\u03c0 2\u03c0 2\u03c0\n(66)\nwhere g is the SU (3)C color coupling constant and ta denote the generators of SU (3)C in\nthe fundamental representation.

These are updated numbers after correcting\nsome numerical errors discovered in [33, 34].\n\ncommensurate with that obtained by the authors of Ref. [20]. The growth for xB near one\nis a result of the relatively quicker fall off with xB of the pdfs; the twist four contribution in\nthe numerator is falling less quickly in this region2 . One can also perform this analysis with\nalternative parameterizations of the structure function moments. This was done in Ref. [33]\nwith similar results and we refer the reader to it for more details.\nFor the kinematic range that will be accessible in the planned JLab experiments, the Bag\nModel estimate for the magnitude of the correction R1 (HT) lies below the expected experimental sensitivity. To the extent that the Y1 term can be separated experimentally from\nthe remaining contributions to the asymmetry, one could test this Bag Model expectation\nby looking for an appreciable Q2 dependence in the data. The presence of such a dependence would point to stronger correlations between quarks of different flavors than implied\nby the Bag Model picture, which correlates the up- and down-quarks largely through the\nconfinement radius and the Pauli exclusion principle. On the other hand, the absence of\nlarge power corrections would imply that the Y1 term can be interpreted primarily in terms\nof the underlying electroweak interactions and/or possible CSV in the parton distributions.\nWe comment on the implications for probes of CSV and new physics in the following section.\nV.\n\nCHARGE SYMMETRY VIOLATION AND NEW PHYSICS\n\nTo the extent that R1 (HT) is either tiny as suggested by the MIT Bag Model estimates\nor large enough to be extracted utilizing the 1/Q2 -dependence, one may hope to use the\n2\n\nIn general, the implementation of the parton model in the threshold region xB \u2192 1 introduces theoretical ambiguities, so we avoid this kinematic regime in computing the relative correction.

In terms of the former, it has\nrecently been suggested that HT contributions to the Y1 term in the deuterium asymmetry\nmay be too large and too theoretically uncertain to utilize this term as a probe of CSV [21].\nThese suggestions were based on the possibility that R\u03b3 and R\u03b3Z could differ substantially.\nWe have shown that at finite Q2 where a twist expansion is still valid, such a possibility\ncannot apply at twist four since R\u03b3 = R\u03b3Z at this order in the twist expansion, up to\nperturbative corrections.

[21]:\n\u03b4u\n2\n\u03b4d\ndp = d +\n2\n\u03b4d\nun = d \u2212\n2\n\u03b4u\ndn = u \u2212\n2\nup = u +\n\n(73)\n\n.\n(74)\n\n\f20\nIn terms of the \u03b4u and \u03b4d one has\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\u0012\n\u0013\n1 2C1u + C1d\n3\n\u03b4u \u2212 \u03b4d\nR1 (CSV) =\n\u2212\n2 2C1u \u2212 C1d\n10\nu+d\n\n.\n\n(75)\n\nThe \u03b4u and \u03b4d have been constrained by structure function data utilizing the ansatz\n\u03b4u \u2212 \u03b4d = 2\u03baf (x)\n\nf (x) = x\u22121/2 (1 \u2212 x)4 (x \u2212 0.0909) ,\n\n(76)\n\nwith \u03ba lying in the range \u22120.8 \u2264 \u03ba \u2264 +0.65. Detailed phenomenological and theoretical\nanalyses of CSV effects can be found in Refs.[21, 41, 42]. In Fig. 2, we show the relative\nmagnitudes of R1 (HT) and R1 (CSV) for a representative value of Q2 = 6 GeV2 and \u03ba\ngiven by the extremes of the allowed range. We observe that the Bag Model higher twist\ncorrection is considerably smaller than the possible range for CSV effects. To the extent that\nthe Bag Model provides a realistic guide for the magnitude of R1 (HT), a series of precise\nmeasurements of the leading term in the asymmetry could provide a powerful probe of CSV\neffects.\nThe implications for probing new physics via R1 (new) are less clear. To be concrete, we\nfollow Ref. [43] and consider new parity-violating contact interactions\nLnew =\n\nX f\n4\u03c0\u03ba2 \u03bc\nhV f \u0304\u03b3 \u03bc f\n\u0113\u03b3\n\u03b3\ne\n5\n2\n\u039b\nf\n\n,\n\n(77)\n\nwhere \u039b is the mass scale associated with the new physics, \u03ba2 gives the overall coupling\nstrength, and the hfV are the specific vector current couplings to each fermion f . Retaining\nonly contributions from up- and down-quarks, we obtain the corresponding contribution to\nthe correction R1 (new):\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u221216\u03c0\u03ba2 \u0010 v \u00112\n2huV \u2212 hdV\nR1 (new) =\n,\n(78)\n3\n\u039b\n1 \u2212 20 sin2 \u03b8W /9\nwhere we have expressed the Fermi constant in terms of the Higgs vaccum expectation value\nv = 246 GeV.\nA given scenario for new physics will determine the specific values of \u03ba, \u039b, and the hfV .\nFor example, E6 grand unified models contain additional U(1) gauge groups that may lead\nto the existence of a TeV-scale Z 0 boson. To illustrate the sensitivity of the Y1 -term to\nthis scenario, we consider a particular pattern of symmetry-breaking that gives rise to a\nlow-mass Z\u03c7 boson. In this case, the correction R1 (new) arises from tree-level exchange of\nthe Z\u03c7 . In terms of the parameters appearing in Eqs. (77,78) one has \u03ba2 = 2.2\u03b1, \u039b = M\u03c7 ,\nhuV = 0, and hdV = \u22121/20. For M\u03c7 = 1 TeV, we obtain R1 (new) = 1.85 \u00d7 10\u22123 independent\nof Q2 . Comparing with Figures 1 and 2, we observe that the scale of this correction is\ncommensurate with that of R1 (HT) in the MIT Bag Model and well below the allowed\n\n\f21\n\n0.03\n\nR1 (CSV )\n\n0.02\n0.01\n\n\u03ba = \u22120.8\n\n0.00\n\nR1 (HT )\n\n!0.01\n!0.02\n\n\u03ba = 0.65\nR1 (CSV )\n\n!0.03\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\nx\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\nFIG. 2: The relative magnitudes of R1 (HT ) and R1 (CSV ) as a function of the Bjorken-x variable\nfor a representative value of Q2 = 6 GeV2 . using \u03b4u \u2212 \u03b4d = 2\u03baf (x) where f (x) = x\u22121/2 (1 \u2212 x)4 (x \u2212\n0.0909) for \u03ba = \u22120.8.

In order for a measurement of the Y1 -term to probe\nthis scenario, one would need an experimental sensitivity of \u223c 0.2% with knowledge of the\nCSV and HT corrections at a similar or better level theoretical precision. On the other\nhand, the planned 4% measurement of the proton's weak charge by the Q-Weak experiment\nat Jefferson Lab will probe the same scenario for a one TeV Z\u03c7 . A similar comparison with\nother scenarios suggests that for a determination of R1 (new) to be competitive with the\nQ-Weak experiment as a probe of new physics3 , one would need a combined experimental\nand theoretical uncertainty of better than \u223c 0.5%. At present, then, it appears that a study\n3\n\nWe note that the RHS of Eq. (45) of Ref. [43] contains an error and should be multiplied by a factor of\n\u221a\neight. As a result, the mass bound scale factor for \u03b4\u03031 in Table I should be multiplied by 2 2. The same\nfactor should be applied to the last entries in Tables II-IV.\n\n\f22\nof the Y1 term in the deuterium asymmetry is better suited as a probe of hadron structure\nthan of new physics4 .\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nParity-violating electron scattering has become a powerful tool for probing both novel\naspects of hadronic and nuclear structure as well as possible indirect signatures of physics\nbeyond the Standard Model. Its efficacy depends on both significant experimental advances\nin controlling systematic uncertainties and attaining high statistics as well as on substantial\ndevelopments in the theoretical interpretation of the parity-violating asymmetries. PVDIS\nrepresents a prime example of this synergy between experiment and theory. The first measurements of the deep inelastic asymmetry for a deuterium target relied on the simplest\nparton-level description of hadrons, yet the result with a 17% experimental uncertainty (for\nthe two highest energy points) was sufficient to single out the Standard Model description of the weak neutral current interaction from other alternatives. Today, one anticipates\nlower-energy measurements at Jefferson Lab with experimental errors below one percent for\nindividual kinematic points, making for O(0.5%) combined uncertainties on quantities of\ninterest. The challenge for theory is to provide a framework for interpreting such precise\nresults.\nIn this study, we have attempted to do so for the leading term in the deuterium asymmetry. In principle, it can be kinematically separated from the subleading term (suppressed by\n1 \u2212 4 sin2 \u03b8W ), making it an object of interest in its own right. In going beyond the simplest\nparton model description of the deuteron structure and the Standard Model description of\nthe weak neutral current interaction, one may expect contributions to this term arising from\nhigher twist operators, the violation of charge symmetry in the leading twist (parton model)\nterms, and new physics. Drawing on early work by Bjorken and Wolfenstein, who showed\nthat this term depends on the matrix element of a single, non-local twist four operator, we\nhave delineated the twist four contribution from those that may arise from CSV and new\nphysics. In doing so, we have shown that that to this order in the twist expansion, one has\nR\u03b3 = R\u03b3Z up to perturbative corrections, making for a theoretically cleaner interpretation\nof the asymmetry than recently suggested in the literature. We have also utilized the MIT\nBag Model to estimate the xB -dependent twist-four correction and find that it is small compared to the range of possible CSV effects as implied by global fits to structure function\ndata. Typical contributions from new physics are also smaller than the allowed CSV range.\n4\n\nWe note that the possible contributions from supersymmeric extensions of the SM have been analyzed\nrecently in Ref. [44], though the analysis applied to the asymmetry as a whole and not the Y1 term alone.\nAfter taking into considerations constraints from other electroweak precision observables and direct search\nlimits, corrections of up to 1.5% on the asymmetry are currently allowed in supersymmetric models.\n\n\f23\nTo the extent that the Bag Model provides a reasonable guide to higher twist quark-quark\ncorrelations, one would not expect to observe appreciable sub-leading power dependence on\nQ2 in the leading term but would, on the other hand, be able to make a clean interpretation\nof this term in terms of CSV. On the other hand, experimental evidence for a substantial\nQ2 power dependence would point to interesting non-perturbative dynamics underlying the\nhigher-twist matrix elements. Either way, a determination of this leading term at the level\nof precision expected for the Jefferson Lab experiments would provide new insights into the\nbehavior of non-perturbative QCD.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank A.

(31) to the structure functions F1,2\nsatisfies the Callan-Gross relation. Here we\nrecast this argument using the language of the Soft-Collinear Effective Theory(SCET) [27\u2013\n29], which is an effective field theory for describing the interactions of collinear and soft\ndegrees of freedom and can be applied to electron-deuteron scattering in the Breit frame. In\nthe language of SCET, the argument for the Callan-Gross relation becomes manifest via the\nstructure of the leading order SCET operator that appears at twist-four from a tree-level\nmatching.\nRecall that the contribution of the twist-four four-quark operator to the hadronic tensor\nZ\n1  \u0304\n1\ndu\nd4 x eiq*x hD(P )| {d\u03b3\nW\u03bc\u03bd =\n\u03bc d(x) \u016b\u03b3\u03bd u(0) + (u \u2194 d)}|D(P )i,\n2\u03c0M\n2\n(A1)\ndu\nis parameterized in terms of the structure functions F1,2\nas\n\ndu\nW\u03bc\u03bd\n=\n\n\u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd +\n\nq\u03bc q\u03bd \u0001 F1du\nP *q \u0001\nP * q \u0001 F2du\n+\nP\n\u2212\nq\nP\n\u2212\nq\u03bd\n,\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bd\nq2 M\nq2\nq2\nMP * q\n\n(A2)\n\nas first written in Eq.

This is schematically shown in Fig. 3. Here C(\u03c91 , \u03c92 , \u03c93 , \u03c94 ) denotes the\nmatching Wilson coefficient.

The labels p, \u03c9i on the SCET fields denote the large part\nof the light cone momentum and the x dependence of the collinear gluon and quark fields\ncorresponds to residual momentum fluctuations. For more details of the matching and the\nSCET notation used here see [45]. What is relevant to our discussion is that the collinear\nquark fields \u03ben that appear in the SCET operator satisfy the equation of motion\nn/\u03ben = 0,\n\n(A11)\n\nwhich is the reason that there are no terms proportional to n\u0304\u03bc n\u0304\u03bd in the tree level matching\nin Eq. (A9). Thus, contracting Eq. (A9) with n\u03bc n\u03bd gives zero using the property n2 = 0.\nApplying these considerations to Eq.
