With the dawn of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) era,\nnew discoveries will hopefully be upon us. In particular, supersymmetry is expected to be found\nas well as the Higgs states required to break the electroweak symmetry. Therefore, it is highly\ndesirable to have complete, concrete models derived from string theory which are able to make\npredictions for the superpartner spectra, as well as describing currently known particle physics.\nIn the old days of string phenomenology, model builders were primarily focused on weakly\ncoupled heterotic string theory. However, with the advent of the second string revolution, Dbranes [1] have created new interest in Type I and II compactifications. In particular, Type IIA\norientifolds with intersecting D6-branes, where the chiral fermions arise at the intersections of\nD6-branes in the internal space [2], with T-dual Type IIB description in terms of magnetized\nD-branes [3], have shown great promise during the last few years. Indeed, intersecting D-brane\nconfigurations provide promising setups which may accommodate semi-realistic features of lowenergy physics. Given this, it is an interesting question to see how far one can get from a particular\nstring compactification to reproducing the finer details of the Standard Model as a low-energy\neffective field theory.\nIn order to construct globally consistent vacua with intersecting D-branes, conditions must\nbe imposed which strongly constrain the models. In particular, all Ramond-Ramond (RR) tadpoles must be cancelled and K-theory [4] conditions for cancelling the nontrivial Z2 anomally\nalso must be imposed. Despite the clear benefits of supersymmetry, there have been many threefamily standard-like models and Grand Unified Theories (GUT) constructed on Type IIA orientifolds [5, 6, 7] which are not supersymmetric. Although these models are globally consistent, they\nare generally plagued by the gauge hierarchy problem and vacuum instability which arises from\nuncancelled Neveu-Schwarz-Neveu-Schwarz (NSNS) tadpoles. Later, semi-realistic supersymmetric\nStandard-like, Pati-Salam, unflipped SU (5) as well as flipped SU (5) models in Type IIA theory\non T6 /(Z2 \u00d7 Z2 ) [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] and T6 /(Z2 \u00d7 Z\u20322 ) [16, 17, 18] orientifolds were\neventually constructed, and some of their phenomenological consequences studied [19, 20]. Other\nsupersymmetric constructions in Type IIA theory on different orientifold backgrounds have also\n\n\f3\nbeen discussed [21]. Nonperturbative D-instanton effects have also been receiving much attention\nof late, and may play an important role [22] [23] [24] [25].\nIn addition to satisfying the above consistency conditions, all open and closed-string moduli\nmust be stabilized in order to obtain an actual vacuum. Unstabilized moduli are manifest in the\nlow-energy theory as massless scalar fields, which are clearly in conflict with observations. Given a\nconcrete string model, the low-energy observables such as particle couplings and resulting masses\nare functions of the open and closed string moduli. In a fully realistic model, these moduli must\ntherefore be stabilized and given sufficiently large masses to meet the astrophysical/cosmological\nand collider physics constraints on additional scalar fields. Although satisfying the conditions for\nN = 1 supersymmetry in Type IIA (IIB) fixes the complex structure (K\u00e4hler) moduli in these\nmodels, the K\u00e4hler (complex structure) and open-string moduli generally remain unfixed. To\nstabilize some of these moduli, supergravity three-form fluxes [26] and geometric fluxes [27] were\nintroduced and flux models on Type II orientifolds have been constructed [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33,\n34, 35, 36, 37]. Models where the D-branes wrap rigid cycles, thus freezing the open-string moduli\nhave also been studied [16, 17, 18].\nDespite substantial progress, there have been other roadblocks in constructing phenomenologically realistic intersecting D-brane models, besides the usual problem of moduli stabilization.\nUnlike heterotic models, the gauge couplings are not automatically unified. Additionally, there\nhas been a rank one problem in the Standard Model (SM) fermion Yukawa matrices, preventing\nthe generation of mass for the first two generations of quarks and leptons. For the case of toroidal\norientifold compactifications, this can be traced to the fact that not all of the Standard Model\nfermions are localized at intersections on the same torus. However, one example of an intersecting\nD6-brane model on Type IIA T6 /(Z2 \u00d7 Z2 ) orientifold has recently been discovered where these\nproblems may be solved [12, 36]. Thus, this particular model may be a step forward to obtaining\nrealistic phenomenology from string theory. Indeed, as we recently discussed [38], it is possible\nwithin the moduli space of this model to obtain correct quark mass matrices and mixings, the tau\nlepton mass, and to generate naturally small neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism. Furthermore, it is possible to generically study the soft supersymmetry breaking terms, from which can\nbe calculated the supersymmetric partner spectra, the Higgs masses, and the resulting neutralino\nrelic density.\nThis paper is organized as follows. First, we will briefly review the intersecting D6-brane model\non Type IIA T6 /(Z2 \u00d7 Z2 ) orientifold which we are studying and discuss its basic features. We\nthen discuss the low-energy effective action, and show that the tree-level gauge couplings are unified\n\n\f4\nnear the string scale. We also find that the hidden sector gauge groups will become confining at a\nhigh energy scale, thus decoupling chiral exotics present in the model. Next, we study the possible\nlow-energy superpartner spectra which may arise. We also calculate the Yukawa couplings for\nquarks and leptons in this model, and show that we may obtain the correct quark masses and\nmixings and the tau lepton mass for specific choices of the open and closed string-moduli VEVs.\nWe should emphasize that for the present work, we will not focus on the moduli stabilization\nproblem, as our goal is only to explore the possible phenemological characteristics of the model.\nHowever, we do comment on this issue and discuss how it may potentially be solved for this model.\nWe also should note that models with an equivalent observable sector have been constructed in\nType IIA and Type IIB theory as Ads and Minkowski flux vacua [36, 39], so that the issue of\nclosed-string moduli stablization has already been addressed to some extent.\n\nII.\n\nA D-BRANE MODEL WITH DESIRABLE SEMI-REALISTIC FEATURES\n\nIn recent years, intersecting D-brane models have provided an exciting approach towards constructing semi-realistic vacua. To summarize, D6 branes (in Type IIA) fill three-dimensional\nMinkowski space and wrap 3-cycles in the compactified manifold, with a stack of N branes having\na gauge group U (N ) (or U (N/2) in the case of T 6 /(Z2 \u00d7 Z2 )) in its world volume. The 3-cycles\nwrapped by the D-branes will in general intersect multiple times in the internal space, resulting in\na chiral fermion in the bifundamental representation localized at the intersection between different\nstacks. The multiplicity of such fermions is then given by the number of times the 3-cycles intersect.\nDue to orientifolding, for every stack of D6-branes we must also introduce its orientifold images.\nThus, the D6-branes may also have intersections with the images of other stacks, also resulting in\nfermions in bifundamental representations. Each stack may also intersect its own images, resulting\nin chiral fermions in the symmetric and antisymmetric representations. The different types of representations that may be obtained for each type of intersection and their multiplicities are shown in\nTable I. In addition, there are constraints that must be satisfied for the consistency of the model,\nnamely the requirement for Ramond-Ramond tadpole cancellation and to have a sprectrum with\nN = 1 supersymmetry.\nIntersecting D-brane configurations provide promising setups which may accommodate semirealistic features of low-energy physics. Given this, it is an interesting question to see how far one\ncan get from a particular string compactification to reproducing the finer details of the Standard\nModel as a low-energy effective field theory. There have been many consistent models studied,\n\n\f5\nbut only a small number have the proper structures to produce an acceptable phenomenology.\nA good candidate for a realistic model which may possess the proper structures was discussed\nin [12, 36, 38] in Type IIA theory on the T6 /(Z2 \u00d7 Z2 ) orientifold. This background has been\nextensively studied and we refer the reader to [8, 9] for reviews of the basic model building rules.\nWe present the D6-brane configurations and intersection numbers of this model in Table II, and\nthe resulting spectrum which is essentially that of a three-family Pati-Salam in Table III [12, 36].\nWe put the a\u2032 , b, and c stacks of D6-branes on the top of each other on the third two torus, and\nas a result there are additional vector-like particles from N = 2 subsectors.\nTABLE I: General spectrum for intersecting D6-branes at generic angles, where Iaa\u2032 = \u221223\u2212k\n\nQ3\n\ni i\ni=1 (na la ),\n\nand IaO6 = 23\u2212k (\u2212la1 la2 la3 + la1 n2a n3a + n1a la2 n3a + n1a n2a la3 ). Moreover, M is the multiplicity, and aS and aA\ndenote the symmetric and anti-symmetric representations of U (Na /2), respectively.\nSector\n\nRepresentation\n\naa\n\nU (Na /2) vector multiplet and 3 adjoint chiral multiplets\nQ3\n\nab + ba\n\nM( N2a , N2b ) = Iab = 2\u2212k\n\nab\u2032 + b\u2032 a\n\nM( N2a , N2b ) = Iab\u2032 = \u22122\u2212k\n\naa\u2032 + a\u2032 a\n\ni i\ni=1 (na lb\n\nQ3\n\n\u2212 nib lai )\n\ni i\ni=1 (na lb\n\n+ nib lai )\n\nM(aS ) = 12 (Iaa\u2032 \u2212 12 IaO6 ) ; M(aA ) = 21 (Iaa\u2032 + 12 IaO6 )\n\nThe anomalies from three global U (1)s of U (4)C , U (2)L and U (2)R are cancelled by the GreenSchwarz mechanism, and the gauge fields of these U (1)s obtain masses via the linear B\u2227F couplings.\nThus, the effective gauge symmetry is SU (4)C \u00d7 SU (2)L \u00d7 SU (2)R . In order to break the gauge\nsymmetry, on the first torus, we split the a stack of D6-branes into a1 and a2 stacks with 6 and\n2 D6-branes, respectively, and split the c stack of D6-branes into c1 and c2 stacks with two D6branes for each one, as shown in Figure 1. In this way, the gauge symmetry is further broken to\nSU (3)C \u00d7 SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)I3R \u00d7 U (1)B\u2212L .

If\nsupersymmetry exists as expected and is softy broken, then it is possible to calculate the soft SUSY\nbreaking terms, which determine the low energy sparticle spectra. Furthermore, if the neutralino\nis the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), then it is expected to make up a large fraction of\nthe observed dark matter density, 0.0945 < \u03a9h2 < 0.1287 at 2\u03c3 [40, 41], and this is calculable\nfrom the soft terms. Ideally, one would also like to be able to calculate the Yukawa couplings for\nthe known quarks and leptons, and be able to reproduce their masses and mixings.\nTo discuss the low-energy phenomenology we start from the low-energy effective action. From\nthe effective scalar potential it is possible to study the stability [42], the tree-level gauge couplings\n[19, 43, 44], gauge threshold corrections [45], and gauge coupling unification [46]. The effective\nYukawa couplings [47, 48], matter field K\u00e4hler metric and soft-SUSY breaking terms have also been\ninvestigated [49]. A more detailed discussion of the K\u00e4hler metric and string scattering of gauge,\nmatter, and moduli fields has been performed in [50]. Although turning on Type IIB 3-form fluxes\ncan break supersymmetry from the closed string sector [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33], there are additional\nterms in the superpotential generated by the fluxes and there is currently no satisfactory model\nwhich incorporates this. Thus, we do not consider this option in the present work. In principle,\nit should be possible to specify the exact mechanism by which supersymmetry is broken, and thus\nto make very specific predictions. However, for the present work, we will adopt a parametrization\nof the SUSY breaking so that we can study it generically.\nThe N = 1 supergravity action depends upon three functions, the holomorphic gauge kinetic\n\n\f9\nfunction, f , K\u00e4hler potential K, and the superpotential W . Each of these will in turn depend\nupon the moduli fields which describe the background upon which the model is constructed. The\nholomorphic gauge kinetic function for a D6-brane wrapping a calibrated three-cyce is given by [34]\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\nZ\n1\n\u2212i\u03b8P\n\u2212\u03c6\n(5)\nC\n\u03a9\n)\n\u2212\ni\nRe(e\ne\nfP =\n3 .\n3\n2\u03c0l3s\n\u03a0P\n\u03a0P\nIn terms of the three-cycle wrapped by the stack of branes, we have\nZ\n\n3\n\n1Y i i\n\u03a93 =\n(na R1 + 2\u2212\u03b2i ilai R2i ).\n4\n\u03a0a\n\n(6)\n\ni=1\n\nfrom which it follows that\nfP =\n\nn1 l2 l3 u1 n2 l1 l3 u2 n3 l1 l2 u3\n1\n(n1P n2P n3P s \u2212 P(\u03b2P +\u03b2P ) \u2212 P(\u03b2P +\u03b2P ) \u2212 P(\u03b2P +\u03b2P ) ),\n4\u03baP\n2 2 3\n2 1 3\n2 1 2\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03baP = 1 for SU (NP ) and \u03baP = 2 for U Sp(2NP ) or SO(2NP ) gauge groups and where we\nuse the s and u moduli in the supergravity basis. In the string theory basis, we have the dilaton\nS, three K\u00e4hler moduli T i , and three complex structure moduli U i [50]. These are related to the\ncorresponding moduli in the supergravity basis by\n!\n\u221a\nIm U 1 Im U 2 Im U 3\ne\u2212\u03c64\nRe (s) =\n2\u03c0\n|U 1 U 2 U 3 |\n!\nr\nUk Ul\nIm U j\ne\u2212\u03c64\nj\nRe (u ) =\n2\u03c0\nIm U k Im U l\nUj\nRe(tj ) =\n\n(j, k, l) = (1, 2, 3)\n\ni\u03b1\u2032\nTj\n\n(8)\n\nand \u03c64 is the four-dimensional dilaton. To second order in the string matter fields, the K\u00e4hler\npotential is given by\nK(M, M\u0304 , C, C\u0304) = K\u0302(M, M\u0304 ) +\n\nX\n\nuntwisted i,j\nX\ntwisted\n\nK\u0303Ci C\u0304j (M, M\u0304 )Ci C\u0304j +\n\n(9)\n\nK\u0303C\u03b8 C\u0304\u03b8 (M, M\u0304 )C\u03b8 C\u0304\u03b8 .\n\u03b8\n\nThe untwisted moduli Ci , C\u0304j are light, non-chiral scalars from the field theory point of view,\nassociated with the D-brane positions and Wilson lines. These fields are not observed in the MSSM,\nand if they were present in the low energy spectra may disrupt the gauge coupling unification.\nClearly, these fields must get a large mass through some mechanism. One way to accomplish this\nis to require the D-branes to wrap rigid cycles, which freezes the open string moduli [17]. However,\nthere are no rigid cycles available on T 6 /(Z2 \u00d7 Z2 ) without discrete torsion, thus we will assume\nthat the open-string moduli become massive via high-dimensional operators.\n\n\f10\nFor twisted moduli arising from strings stretching between stacks P and Q, we have\n\nP\n\nj\n\n\u03b8Pj Q = 0,\n\nj\nwhere \u03b8Pj Q = \u03b8Q\n\u2212 \u03b8Pj is the angle between the cycles wrapped by the stacks of branes P and Q on\n\nthe j th torus respectively.

For simplicity, it is assumed\n\n\f11\nin this analysis that the D-term does not contribute (see [51]) to the SUSY breaking. Then the\ngoldstino is included by the gravitino via the superHiggs effect. The gravitino then obtains a mass\nm3/2 = eG/2 ,\n\n(16)\n\nwhich we will take to be \u2248 1 TeV in the following. The normalized gaugino mass parameters,\nscalar mass-squared parameters, and trilinear parameters respectively may be given in terms of\nthe K\u00e4hler potential, the gauge kinetic function, and the superpotential as\n1\n(F M \u2202M fP ),\n2RefP\nX\nF\u0304 M\u0304 F N \u2202M\u0304 \u2202N log(K\u0303P Q ),\n= (m23/2 + V0 ) \u2212\n\nMP =\nm2P Q\n\n(17)\n\nM,N\n\nh\n\ni\nAP QR = F M K\u0302M + \u2202M log(YP QR ) \u2212 \u2202M log(K\u0303P Q K\u0303QR K\u0303RP ) ,\n\nwhere K\u0302M is the K\u00e4hler metric appropriate for branes which are parallel on at least one torus, i.e.\ninvolving non-chiral matter.\nThe above formulas for the soft terms depend on the Yukawa couplings, via the superpotential.\nAn important consideration is whether or not this should cause any modification to the lowenergy spectrum. However, this turns out not to be the case since the Yukawas in the soft term\nformulas are not the same as the physical Yukawas, which arise from world-sheet instantons and\nare proportional to exp(\u2212A), where A is the world-sheet area of the triangles formed by a triplet of\nintersections at which the Standard Model fields are localized. As we shall see in a later section, the\nphysical Yukawa couplings in Type IIA depend on the K\u00e4hler moduli and the open-string moduli.\nThis ensures that the Yukawa couplings present in the soft terms do not depend on either the\ncomplex-structure moduli or dilaton (in the supergravity basis). Thus, the Yukawa couplings will\nnot affect the low-energy spectrum in the case of u-moduli dominant and mixed u and s dominant\nsupersymmetry breaking.\nTo determine the SUSY soft breaking parameters, and therefore the spectra of the models, we\nintroduce the VEVs of the auxiliary fields Eq. (15) for the dilaton, complex and K\u00e4hler moduli\n[52]:\n\u221a\nF s = 2 3Cm3/2 Re(s)\u0398s e\u2212i\u03b3s ,\n\u221a\nu\nt\ni\nF {u,t} = 2 3Cm3/2 (Re(ui )\u0398ui e\u2212i\u03b3i + Re(ti )\u0398ti e\u2212i\u03b3i ).\n\n(18)\n\nThe factors \u03b3s and \u03b3i are the CP violating phases of the moduli, while the constant C is given by\nC2 = 1 +\n\nV0\n.\n3m23/2\n\n(19)\n\n\f12\nThe goldstino is included in the gravitino by \u0398S in S field space, and \u0398i parameterize the goldstino\nP\ndirection in U i space, where (|\u0398ui |2 + |\u0398ti |2 ) + |\u0398s |2 = 1. The goldstino angle \u0398s determines the\ndegree to which SUSY breaking is being dominated by the dilaton s and/or complex structure (ui )\n\nand K\u00e4hler (ti ) moduli. As suggested earlier, we will not consider the case of t-moduli dominant\nsupersymmetry breaking as in this case, the soft terms are not independent of the Yukawa couplings.\n\nIV.\n\nGAUGE COUPLING UNIFICATION\n\nThe MSSM predicts the unification of the three gauge couplings at an energy \u223c 2.4 \u00d7 1016 GeV.\nIn intersecting D-brane models, the gauge groups arise from different stacks of branes, and so they\nwill not generally have the same volume in the compactified space. Thus, the gauge couplings\nare not automatically unified, in contrast to heterotic models. For branes wrapping cycles not\ninvariant under \u03a9R, the holomorphic gauge kinetic function for a D6 brane stack P is given by\nEq. (7). where ui and s are the complex structure moduli and dilaton in the supergravity basis.\nThe gauge coupling constant associated with a stack P is given by\n\u22122\n= |Re (fP )|.\ngD6\nP\n\n(20)\n\nThus, for the model under study the SU (3) holomorphic gauge function is identified with stack a1\nand the SU (2) holomorphic gauge function with stack b. The QY holomorphic gauge function is\nthen given by taking a linear combination of the holomorphic gauge functions from all the stacks.\nNote that we have absorbed a factor of 1/2 in the definition of QY so that the electric charge is\ngiven by Qem = T3 + QY . In this way, it is found [53] that\n1\n1\n1\n1\nfY = fa1 + fa2 + fc1 + fc2 .\n6\n2\n2\n2\n\n(21)\n\nRecalling that the complex structure moduli U i are obtained from the supersymmetry conditions,\nwe have for the present model\nU 1 = 3i , U 2 = i , U 3 = \u22121 + i .\n\n(22)\n\nThus, we find that the tree-level MSSM gauge couplings will be automatically unified at the\nstring scale\ngs2\n\n=\n\n2\ngw\n\n\"\n\u221a #\u22121\ne\u2212\u03c64 6\n5 2\n.\n= gY =\n3\n2\u03c0 4\n\n(23)\n\nEven though the gauge couplings are unified, this does not fix the actual value of the couplings as\nthese still depend upon the value taken by the four-dimensional dilaton \u03c64 . In order for the gauge\n\n\f13\n2\n\u2248 0.511), we must choose \u03c64 = \u22123\ncouplings to have the value observed for the MSSM (gunification\n\nsuch that e\u2212\u03c64 \u2248 20, which fixes the string scale as\n\nMSt = \u03c0 1/2 e\u03c64 MP l \u2248 2.1 \u00d7 1017 GeV,\n\n(24)\n\nwhere MP l is the reduced Planck scale.\nIt should be kept in mind that values given for the gauge couplings at the string scale are only\nthe tree-level results. There are one-loop threshold corrections arising from the N = 1 and N = 2\nopen string sectors [45] which may alter these results. In addition, there is exotic matter charged\nunder both observable and hidden sector gauge groups, which are expected to pick up large masses,\nbut could still affect the running of the gauge couplings.\n\nV.\n\nCONFINEMENT OF THE HIDDEN SECTOR FIELDS\n\nIn addition to the matter content of the MSSM, there is also matter charged under the hidden\nsector U Sp(2) gauge groups. These states will generally have fractional electric charges, similar to\nthe so-called 'cryptons' [54, 55, 56, 57]. Obviously, no such matter is observed in the low-energy\nspectrum so these exotic states must receive a large mass. Such a mass may arise if the hidden\nsector gauge couplings are asymptotically free and become confining at some high energy. Indeed,\nin the present case we find that the \u03b2-functions for the U Sp(2) groups are all negative [12],\n\u03b2U Sp(2)1 = \u03b2U Sp(2)2 = \u03b2U Sp(2)3 = \u03b2U Sp(2)4 = \u22123,\n\n(25)\n\nwhere we consider all of the chiral exotic particles present even though it is expected that these\nstates will decouple as discussed previously. From the holomorphic gauge kinetic function, the\ngauge couplings are found to take the values\ngU2 Sp(2)1 = gU2 Sp(2)2 \u2248 3,\n\n(26)\n\ngU2 Sp(2)3 = gU2 Sp(2)4 \u2248 1.\nat the string scale.

(18). In the present analysis, not all the F-terms of the moduli get VEVs for\nsimplicity, as in [58, 59]. As discussed earlier, we will assume that Fit = 0 so that the soft terms\nhave no dependence on the physical Yukawa couplings. Thus, we consider two cases:\n1. The u-moduli dominated SUSY breaking where both the cosmological constant V0 and the\ni\n\ngoldstino angle are set to zero, such that F s = F t = 0.\n2. The u and s-moduli SUSY breaking where the cosmological constant V0 = 0 and F s 6= 0.\nA.\n\nSUSY breaking with u-moduli dominance\n\nFor this case we take \u0398s = 0 so that the F -terms are parameterized by the expression\ni\n\nFu =\n\n\u221a\n\n3m3/2 (ui + \u016bi )\u0398i e\u2212i\u03b3i ,\n\n(28)\n\n\f15\nwhere i = 1,2,3 and with\n\nP\n\n|\u0398i |2 = 1.

The trilinears and scalar mass-squared values depend explicitly only on the\nangles. However, there is an implicit dependence on the complex structure moduli via the angles\nmade by each D-brane with respect to the orientifold planes.\nIn contrast to heterotic string models, the gaugino and scalar masses are typically not universal\nin intersecting D-brane constructions, although in the present case, there is some partial universality\nof the scalar masses due to the Pati-Salam unification at the string scale. In particular, the trilinear\nA couplings are found to be equal to a universal parameter, A0 and the left-handed and right-handed\nsquarks and sleptons respectively are degenerate. The Higgs states arise from the non-chiral sector\ndue to the fact that stacks b, c1, and c2 are parallel on the third torus. The appropriate K\u00e4hler\n\n\f17\nmetric for these states is given by Eq. (12). Thus, the Higgs scalar mass-squared values are found\nto be\nm2H\n\n=\n\nm23/2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n3\n2\n1 \u2212 |\u03983 | .\n2\n\n(40)\n\nThe complex structure moduli ui , and the four-dimensional dilaton \u03c64 are fixed by the supersymmetry conditions and gauge coupling unification respectively. The K\u00e4hler modulus on the first\ntorus t1 will be chosen to be consistent with the Yukawa mass matrices calculated in the next\nsection. Thus, the free parameters which remain are \u03981,2 , sgn(\u03983 ), t2 , t3 , the phases \u03b3i , and\nthe gravitino mass m3/2 . In order to eliminate potential problems with electric dipole moments\n(EDM's) for the neutron and electron, we set \u03b3i = 0. In addition, we set the K\u00e4hler moduli on\nthe second and third tori equal to one another, Re(t2 ) = Re(t3 ) = 0.5 and take the gravitino mass\nm3/2 \u223c 1 TeV. Note that the soft terms only have a weak logarithmic dependence on the K\u00e4hler\nmoduli.\nWe constrain the parameter space such that neither the Higgs nor the squark and slepton scalar\nmasses are tachyonic at the high scale, as well as imposing the unitary condition \u039821 + \u039822 + \u039833 = 1.\nIn particular, we require \u039823 \u2264 2/3, or equivalently \u039821 + \u039822 \u2265 1/3.\nTo determine the soft terms and superpartner spectra at the low energy scale, we run the RGE's\ndown from the high scale using the code SuSpect [60]. In principle, we should be able to determine\ntan \u03b2, and the \u03bc and B parameters directly from the model. For the present construction, there\nis in fact a \u03bc parameter, whose real part corresponds geometrically to the separation between\nstacks b and c. In the absence of any effects which stabilize the open-string moduli, there are\ncorresponding flat directions in the moduli space. Indeed, the calculation of the Yukawa couplings\nin the next section will exploit this freedom. Thus, the effective \u03bc-term cannot be calculated until\nthe moduli stablization issue has been addressed. Essentially the same considerations apply for a\ndetermination of tan \u03b2, which depends upon the explicit values for the neutral component VEV of\nthe Higgs fields, up to an over-all constant. The overall issue of moduli stablization is discussed in\na later section.\nFor the present work, we will fix these values via the requirement for electroweak symmetry\nbreaking (EWSB), in a similar fashion to [58]. We also choose \u03bc > 0 as favored by (g \u2212 2) and\ntake tan \u03b2 as a free parameter. We use the value for the top quark mass mt = 170.9 GeV. Then,\nknowing the low energy spectra, we can then determine the corresponding neutralino relic density.\nTo calculate this, we use the code MicrOMEGAS [61]. Some points in the parameter space which\ngive the observed dark matter density are shown in Table IV where we have fixed \u0398s = 0.\n\n\f18\n\nTABLE IV: Supersymmetry breaking soft terms at the string scale and resulting neutralino relic density for\nsome specific choices of goldstino angles, with \u0398s = 0.\n\n\u03981\n\n\u03982\n\n\u03983\n\nMG\u0303 (GeV) MW\u0303 (GeV) MB\u0303 (GeV) mH (GeV) mL (GeV) mR (GeV) At (GeV) LSP \u03a9h2\n\n\u22120.610 0.290 0.737\n\n889\n\n251\n\n422\n\n429\n\n963\n\n466\n\n676\n\nB\u0303\n\n0.115\n\n\u22120.610 0.380 0.695\n\n931\n\n329\n\n416\n\n524\n\n989\n\n478\n\n610\n\nB\u0303\n\n0.108\n\n\u22120.600 0.470 0.647\n\n967\n\n407\n\n411\n\n609\n\n1005\n\n492\n\n531\n\nB\u0303\n\n0.113\n\n\u22120.100 0.870 0.482\n\n1171\n\n753\n\n667\n\n806\n\n684\n\n521\n\n\u2212312\n\nB\u0303\n\n0.118\n\n0.0400\n\n0.600 0.799\n\n1211\n\n519\n\n920\n\n205\n\n510\n\n590\n\n\u2212222\n\nB\u0303\n\n0.105\n\n0.110 \u22120.570 0.814\n\n211\n\n\u2212493\n\n564\n\n74\n\n561\n\n631\n\n431\n\n0.150\n\n0.660 0.736\n\n1209\n\n571\n\n944\n\n432\n\n529\n\n512\n\n\u2212397\n\nB\u0303\n\n0.108\n\n0.010\n\n0.810 0.586\n\n1209\n\n701\n\n793\n\n695\n\n603\n\n510\n\n\u2212371\n\nB\u0303\n\n0.094\n\nB\u0303/H\u0303 0.107\n\nTABLE V: Low energy supersymmetric particles and their masses (in GeV) for \u03981 = \u22120.610, \u03982 = 0.290,\n\u03983 = 0.737, and \u0398s = 0. with tan \u03b2 = 46.\nh0\n\nH0\n\nA0\n\nH\u00b1\n\ng\u0303\n\n\u03c7\u00b1\n1\n\n\u03c7\u00b1\n2\n\n\u03c701\n\n\u03c702\n\n116.89 826.80 826.81 831.05 1985 192.3 1115. 173.3 192.3\n\u03c703\n\n\u03c704\n\nt\u03031\n\nt\u03032\n\n-1113. 1114\n\n1477\n\n1789\n\nd \u03031 /s\u03031 d \u03032 /s\u03032\n\n\u03c4\u03031\n\n\u03c4\u03032\n\n1950\n\n1760\n\n189.0\n\n\u01691 /c\u03031 \u01692 /c\u03032\n\nb\u03031\n\nb\u03032\n\n1949 1761 1638 1791\n\u03bd\u0303\u03c4\n\n\u1ebd1 /\u03bc\u03031 \u1ebd2 /\u03bc\u03032 \u03bd\u0303e /\u03bd\u0303\u03bc\n\n928.2 919.5 973.3 488.0 970.1\n\nA contour plot of the dark matter density is displayed in Fig 3 with m3/2 = 1 TeV, tan \u03b2 = 46\nand for \u03983 > 0.

The dark grey regions denote regions where either the neutralino\nis not the LSP, mass limits are not satisfied or for which there is no RGE solution.

At present, there has been no\nsatisfactory explanation for this. However, in addition to the replication of chirality, intersecting\nD-brane models may naturally give rise to mass hierarchies and mixing.\nThe Yukawa couplings in the intersecting D-brane worlds arise from open string world-sheet\ninstantons that connect three D-brane intersections [62]. For a given triplet of intersections, the\nminimal action world-sheets which contribute to the Yukawa coupling are weighted by a factor\nexp(\u2212Aabc ), where Aabc is the world-sheet area of the triangles bounded by the branes a, b, and\nc. Since there are several possible triangles with different areas, mass hierarchies may arise. One\nmay also see that the Yukawa couplings depend on both the D-brane positions in the internal\nspace, as well as on the geometry of the underlying compact manifold. Effectively, these quantities\nare parameterized by open and closed-string moduli VEVs. Thus, in order to make any definitive\npredictions for the Yukawa couplings, these moduli must be stabilized.\n\n\f25\n\nTABLE X: Low energy supersymmetric particles and their masses (in GeV) for \u03981 = 0.140, \u03982 = 0.870,\n\u03983 = 0.473, and \u0398s = 0.40 with tan \u03b2 = 46 and m3/2 = 1 TeV.\nh0\n\nH0\n\nA0\n\nH\u00b1\n\ng\u0303\n\n\u03c7\u00b1\n1\n\n\u03c7\u00b1\n2\n\n\u03c701\n\n\u03c702\n\n118.02 911.27 911.17 915.16 2136 323.6 1138. 247.4 323.6\n\u03c703\n\n\u03c704\n\nt\u03031\n\n-1134\n\n1137\n\n1515.\n\nd \u03031 /s\u03031 d \u03032 /s\u03032\n1912.\n\nt\u03032\n\n267.6\n\nb\u03031\n\nb\u03032\n\n1691. 1911. 1933. 1639 1762.\n\n\u03c4\u03031\n\n1931\n\n\u01691 /c\u03031 \u01692 /c\u03032\n\n\u03c4\u03032\n\n\u03bd\u0303\u03c4\n\n\u1ebd1 /\u03bc\u03031 \u1ebd2 /\u03bc\u03032 \u03bd\u0303e /\u03bd\u0303\u03bc\n\n517.4 425.9 540.1 602.7 534.4\n\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n\ns\n\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n-1.0\n-0.8\n-0.6\n-0.4\n-0.2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n-0.5\n-1.0\n\nFIG. 7: The viable parameter space with \u03a9h2 \u2264 0.125 for \u0398s \u2265 0.\n\nDespite the promise of intersecting D-brane models in explaining the fermion mass hierarchies\nand mixings of the Standard Model, they have typically been plagued by a rank-1 problem in\nthe Yukawa mass matrices. This can be traced to the fact that not all of the Standard Model\nfermions are localized at intersections on the same torus (in the case of toroidal orientifold compactifications). The general flavour structure and selection rules for intersecting D-brane models\nas been investigated in [63, 64] However, the intersections are all on the first torus for the model\nof the previous section. Thus the resulting Yukawa mass matrices do not have a rank-1 problem.\nIn the following, we will explore the moduli space of this model in order to see if there are any\nsolutions which may give rise to realistic Yukawa textures, following the analysis of [47], without\nfirst addressing the issue of moduli stabilization. Our goal for the present work is simply to see if\nthe observed fermion mass hierarchies may arise in this model and identify the points in the moduli\n\n\f26\nspace where this may happen. We discuss how the moduli might be fixed in a later section.\n\nA.\n\nThe general form\n\nWe start by considering D6 branes in Type IIA, where the D6-branes wrap 3-cycles which\nintersect at angles on a compact manifold T6 = T2 \u00d7 T2 \u00d7 T2 . For simplicity, we consider three\nstacks of D-branes wrapping on a two-torus. The 3-cycles wrapped by the D-branes can be written\nin a vector form in terms of the wrapping numbers:\n[\u03a0a ] = na [a] + ma [b] : za = R(n + U ma ) * xa ,\n[\u03a0b ] = nb [a] + mb [b] : zb = R(nb + U mb ) * xb ,\n[\u03a0c ] = nc [a] + mc [b] : zc = R(nc + U mc ) * xc ,\n\n(51)\n\nwhere U is the complex structure parameter of the torus and x \u2208 R arbitrary numbers. The\nYukawa coupling involving branes a, b, and c recieves a contribution from the areas of the triangles\nbounded by the triplet of D-branes. To ensure that the triplet of intersections actually form a\ntriangle, we must impose the closer condition [47],\nza + zb + zc = 0.\n\n(52)\n\nThe wrapping numbers are all integers due to the quantization conditions, so by translating Eq.\n(52) into the Diophantine equation, the solution is found to be\nIbc\nx,\nd\nIca\nxb =\nx, x = x0 + l, x0 \u2208 R, l \u2208 Z,\nd\nIab\nx,\nxc =\nd\n\nxa =\n\n(53)\n\nwhere Iab is the intersection number, and d = g.c.d.(Iab , Ibc , Ica ) is the greatest common divisor of\nthe intersection numbers. The parameter l indexes the different points in the covering space C but\nthe same points in the lattice of T2 of the triangles. The quantity x0 is dependent on the different\nintersection points of two of the D-branes which are indexed by\ni = 0, 1, * * * , (|Iab | \u2212 1),\nj = 0, 1, * * * , (|Ibc | \u2212 1),\nk = 0, 1, * * * , (|Ica | \u2212 1),\n\n(54)\n\n\f27\ntherefore x0 can be written as\ni\n\nx0 (i, j, k) =\n\nIab\n\n+\n\nj\nk\n+\n.\nIca Ibc\n\n(55)\n\nIt is not necessary to require that all branes intersect at the origin. If the position of the stacks\nis shifted by an amount \u01eb\u03b1 , \u03b1 = a, b, c, in clockwise directions of stack \u03b1 by a length in units of\nA/||\u03a0\u03b1 || on each torus, then x0 will be modified as\nx0 (i, j, k) =\n\ni\nj\nk\nd(Iab \u01ebc + Ica \u01ebb + Iab \u01eba )\n+\n+\n+\n.\nIab Ica Ibc\nIab Ibc Ica\n\n(56)\n\nWith this parameterizion of x0 , we can now calculate the areas of the triangles, by the area formula\nof vectors\n1p 2 2\n|za | |zb | \u2212 (Reza z\u0304b )2\n2\n1\ni\nj\nk\nAijk (l) = (2\u03c0)2 A|Iab Ibc Ica |(\n+\n+\n+ \u01eb + l)2 ,\n2\nIab\nIca Ibc\nA(za , zb ) =\n\n\u2192\n\n(57)\n\nwhere \u01eb is the total shift effect in Eq. (56),\n\u01eb=\n\nIab \u01ebc + Ica \u01ebb + Ibc \u01eba\nIab Ibc Ica\n\n(58)\n\nand A is the K\u00e4hler structure of the torus, which is generally the area. By adding a real phase\n\u03c3abc = sign(Iab Ibc Ica ) for the full instanton contribution, the corresponding Yukawa coupling for\nthe three states localized at the intersections indexed by (i, j, k) is [47]\nYijk = hqu \u03c3abc\n\nX\n\nexp(\u2212\n\nl\u2208Z\n\nAijk (l)\n),\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\n\n(59)\n\nwhere hqu is due to quantum correction as discussed in [48]. The summation can be expressed in\nterms of a modular theta function for convenient numerical calculation. The real version of this\ntheta function can be written as\n\uf8ee\n\n\u03b8\uf8f0\n\n\u03b4\n\u03c6\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fb (t) =\n\nX\n\n2\n\ne\u2212\u03c0t(\u03b4+l) e2l\u03c0i(\u03b4+l)\u03c6 ,\n\n(60)\n\nl\u2208Z\n\nso after comparing the parameters, we have\n\u03b4=\n\ni\n\n+\n\nj\nk\n+ \u01eb,\n+\nIca Ibc\n\nIab\n\u03c6 = 0,\nA\nt = \u2032 |Iab Ibc Ica |.\n\u03b1\n\n(61)\n(62)\n(63)\n\n\f28\na.\n\nB-field and Wilson lines\n\nThe theta function above is constrained by its real property.\n\nHowever, t can be complex\n\nand \u03c6 can be any number as an overall phase which can be given both a theoretical and\nphenomenological interpretation.\nIf we turn on a B-field in the compact space T2 , the string will not only couple to the metric\nbut also to this B-field. Then the K\u00e4hler structure may be written in a complex form\nJ = B + iA,\n\n(64)\n\nwhere the parameter t is replaced by a complex parameter \u03ba\n\u03ba=\n\nJ\n|Iab Ibc Ica |.\n\u03b1\u2032\n\n(65)\n\nWe can also include Wilson lines around the compact directions that the D-branes wrap in this\nconstruction [47]. To avoid breaking any gauge symmetry, these Wilson lines are chosen up to a\nphase. If we consider the Yukawa coupling formed by D-branes a, b, and c, wrapping a different\none-cycle with Wilson lines in the phases exp(2\u03c0i\u03b8a ), exp(2\u03c0i\u03b8b ), and exp(2\u03c0i\u03b8c ) respectively, then\nthe total phase is a linear combination of each phase weighted by the relative longitude of each\nsegment, determined by the intersection points:\ne2\u03c0ixa \u03b8a e2\u03c0ixb \u03b8b e2\u03c0ixc \u03b8c = e2\u03c0ix(Ibc \u03b8a +Ica \u03b8b +Iab \u03b8c ) .\nThus, including these two effects, we obtain a general complex theta function as\n\uf8ee \uf8f9\nX\n\u03b4\n2\n\u03b8 \uf8f0 \uf8fb (\u03ba) =\ne\u03c0i\u03ba(\u03b4+l) e2\u03c0i(\u03b4+l)\u03c6 ,\n\u03c6\nl\u2208Z\n\n(66)\n\n(67)\n\nwhere\n\nj\nk\ni\n+\n+\n+ \u01eb,\nIab Ica Ibc\n\u03c6 = Ibc \u03b8a + Ica \u03b8b + Iab \u03b8c ,\nJ\n\u03ba = \u2032 |Iab Ibc Ica |.\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b4=\n\nb.\n\n(68)\n(69)\n(70)\n\nOther modification\n\nIn most of the (semi-)realistic models orientifold planes must be introduced to cancel the\nRR-tadpoles. As a result, there will be additional fields from the brane images coupling to the\n\n\f29\nordinary branes fields as well as themselves. For example, for the triangle formed by branes a,\nb\u2032 , and c, the Yukawa coupling will then depend on the parameters Iab\u2032 , Ib\u2032 c , and Ica , and the\ncorresponding indicies are i\u2032 , j, and k\u2032 , where the primed indexes are independent of the unprimed\nones.\nThe other issue is the non-coprime cases. The three intersection numbers are not necessarily\ncoprime, so we have to make sure we do not over-count the repeated parts. The constant d is\ndefined as the g.c.d. of the intersection numbers and is introduced in the brane shift parameters.\nWe must then modify the other parameters as well:\nIbc \u03b8a + Ica \u03b8b + Iab \u03b8c\n,\nd\nJ |Iab Ibc Ica |\n\u03ba= \u2032\n.\n\u03b1\nd2\n\n(71)\n\n\u03c6=\n\n(72)\n\nThere is one more constraint which is necessary to ensure non-zero Yukawa couplings: the\ntriangles must be bounded by D-branes. Thus the intersection indexes i, j, and k cannot be\narbitrary. They are required to satisfy [47]\ni + j + k = 0 mod d.\n\n(73)\n\nThere is one degree of freedom which may ease this constraint, which is an additional parameter\nin \u03b4: [47]\n\u03b4=\n\ni\nIab\n\n+\n\nj\ns\nk\n+\u01eb+ ,\n+\nIca Ibc\nd\n\n(74)\n\nwhere s is a linear combination of i, j, and k, and it is just a shift of counting the triangles since\nwe have required {i, j, k} to satisfy (73).\nTherefore finally, we can write down a complete form for the Yukawa couplings for D6-branes\nwrapping on a full compact space T2 \u00d7 T2 \u00d7 T2 as\nY{ijk} = hqu \u03c3abc\n\n3\nY\n\nr=1\n\nwhere\n\uf8ee\n\n\u03b8\uf8f0\n\n\u03b4(r)\n\u03c6(r)\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fb (\u03ba(r) ) =\n\nX\n\nlr \u2208Z\n\ne\u03c0i(\u03b4\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\u03b8\uf8f0\n\n\u03b4(r)\n\u03c6(r)\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fb (\u03ba(r) ),\n\n(r) +l )2 \u03ba(r)\nr\n\ne2\u03c0i(\u03b4\n\n(r) +l )\u03c6(r)\nr\n\n(75)\n\n,\n\n(76)\n\n\f30\nwith r = 1, 2, 3 denoting the three two-tori.

Thus, in our analysis we will focus on the just the first torus, since\nthe contribution from the other two tori will just give an over-all constant. This constant,which is\ndifferent for the up-type and down-type quark, and charged lepton mass matrices, is unimportant\nfor the present analysis since we will only obtain the mass ratios rather than the absolute fermion\nmasses.\nAs described in the previous analysis, the Pati-Salam gauge symmetry is broken to the Standard\n\n\f31\n\n1\n\u03a5H\u039a,\u2206L 0.75\n0.5\n0.25\n0\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4 \u2206\n\n10\n20\n\n0.2\n\n30\n\u039a\n\n40\n500\n\nFIG. 8: Theta function as a function of the parameters \u03b4 and \u03ba, with \u03c6 = 0.

For\na given set of VEVs for the Higgs fields chosen to obtain the desired Yukawa matrices, we can then\nwrite the light Higgs eigenstates as\nHu,d =\ni = hH i i.\nwith vu,d\nu,d\n\nX\n\ni\nvu,d\ni\nqP\n,\nHu,d\ni\n2\n(vu,d )\n\n(96)\n\nOne may see from the form of the above mass matrices that there is a natural mass hierarchy\namong the up-quarks, down-quarks and leptons which has a geometric interpretation related to the\nposition of the different D-branes, as parameterized by the shifts \u01ebi . Recall that the Pati-Salam\ngauge symmetry has been broken to the SM by a process which involves splitting the stacks of\nD-branes as shown in Fig. 1. The left-handed quarks are localized at the intersections between\nstacks a1 and b, the right-handed up-type quarks are localized between stacks a1 and c1, while the\nright-handed down-type quarks are localized between stacks a1 and c2. Thus, if stack c2 is shifted\non the torus by an amount \u01ebc2 while stack c1 is unshifted (\u01ebc1 = 0), then the down-type quark\nmasses are naturally suppressed relative to the up-type quarks. Similarly, the left-handed charged\nleptons are localized at the intersection between stack a2 and b, while the right-handed charged\nleptons are localized at the intersection between stacks a2 and c2. Since stack a2 will be shifted\nby some amount \u01eba2 , the resulting charged lepton masses will be naturally suppressed relative to\nthe down-type quarks. Thus, from purely geometric considerations, we expect\nmu > md > ml .\n\n(97)\n\nIt is also clear from the form of the mass matrices that the mass hierarchies between the\ndifferent up-type quarks among themselves, the different down-type quarks among themselves, and\nthe different charged leptons among themselves are due primarily to the different Higgs neutral\ncomponent VEVs. Effectively, these values will determined by fine-tuning the superpotential so\nthat there are only two Higgs eigenstates as shown in Eq. 96. Ideally, one would like to be able\nto dynamically determine the Higgs eigenstates from first principles rather than fine-tuning the\nsuperpotential. However, it does not seem possible to do this at least until the issue of moduli\nstablization has been fully addressed.\n\n\f37\nIf we define Du and Dd as the mass diagonal matrices of up and down-type quarks respectively,\n\u2020\n\n\u2020\n\nULu Mu URu \u2020 = Du , ULd Md URd = Dd , VCKM = ULu ULd ,\n\n(98)\n\nwhere U i are unitary matrices, then the squared mass matrices are Mu Mu\u2020 and Md Md\u2020 . In the\nStandard Model, we can always make quark mass matrices Mu and Md Hermitian by suitable\ntransformation of the right-handed fields. If we take a case that the Md is very close to the\ndiagonal matrix for down-type quark, in other words, ULd and URd are very close to the unit matrix\nwith very small off-diagonal terms, then\nVCKM \u2243 U u U d\u2020 \u2243 U u ,\n\n(99)\n\nwhere we have transformed away the right-handed effects and make them the same as the lefthanded ones. Then the mass matrix of the up-type quarks is\n\u2020\nMu \u223c VCKM\nDu VCKM .\n\n(100)\n\n(ii) An Example\nFor different superpartner spectra, we may determine the mass matrices for quarks and leptons\nby running the RGE's up to the unification scale. For example, for tan\u03b2 \u2248 50 the CKM matrix at\nthe unification scale \u03bc = MX may be determined to be [65, 66]\n\n\uf8eb\n\n0.9754\n\n0.2205\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nVCKM = \uf8ec \u22120.2203e0.003\u25e6 i\n0.9749\n\uf8ed\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n0.0075e\u221219 i \u22120.0311e1.0 i\n\n\u22120.0026i\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n0.0318 \uf8f7 ,\n\uf8f8\n0.9995\n\nand the diagonal quark mass matrices Du and Dd may be written\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n0.0000139\n0\n0\n0.00141\n0\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\nDu = mt \uf8ec\n0\n0.00404 0 \uf8f7 , Dd = mb \uf8ec\n0\n0.0280 0 \uf8f7 .\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f8\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\nThen the absolute value of Mu turns out to be\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0.000266 0.00109 0.00747\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n|Mu | = mt \uf8ec 0.00109 0.00481 0.0310 \uf8f7 .\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n0.00747 0.0310 0.999\n\n(101)\n\n(102)\n\n(103)\n\nWe can then fine-tune the parameters and Higgs VEVs in Eqs.

In doing so, we are essentially constrained by the\noff-diagnonal terms, as can be seen by comparing Eq. 93 with Eq. 103. For example, the (11)\nelement of |Mu | is 0.00109, while the corresponding element of the fitted mass matrix is Bv3 + F v6 .\nHowever, the diagonal (33) element of the fitted matrix is given by Av3 + Ev6 which should be of\norder unity. Thus, to fit the mass matrix we must require\nBv3 + F v6\n\u2248 0.00109,\nAv3 + Ev6\nwhich effectively means that\n\nB\nA\n\n<< 1 and\n\nF\nE\n\n(104)\n\n<< 1.\n\nIn Fig. 10, we plot the ratio\n\uf8ee\n\n\u03b8\uf8f0\n\n\u03b4\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fb (\u03ba) = e\u2212\u03c0\u03ba\u03b42 \u03b83 (i\u03c0\u03ba\u03b4, e\u2212\u03c0\u03ba )\n\n0\n\uf8ee\n\n\u03b8\uf8f0\n\n\u03b4=0\n0\n\n\uf8f9\n\n.\n\n(105)\n\n\uf8fb (\u03ba) = \u03b83 (0, e\u2212\u03c0\u03ba )\n\nIt can be seen from this plot that the off-diagonal terms will be naturally suppressed relative to\nthe diagonal elements.

However, the tau lepton mass does come out correctly. This result can be understood\nby considering that the only difference between the down-type quark and lepton mass matrices is\nan overall exponential factor which results from the additional shift for the leptonic brane, \u01eba1 .\nAlthough this result seems to give the wrong answers for the electron and muon masses, it should\nbe kept in mind that these are only tree-level results. Indeed, it is of interest that the error in\nthe obtained lepton masses seems to increase with decreasing mass. There could indeed be other\ncorrections, such as those coming from higher-dimensional operators, which would contribute most\ngreatly to the electron and muon masses since they are quite small.\nIn short, the above mass matrices can produce the correct quark masses and CKM mixings, and\nthe correct \u03c4 lepton mass at the electroweak scale. The electron mass is about 5 \u223c 6.5 times larger\nthan the expected value, while the muon mass is about 50 \u223c 60% too small. Similar to GUTs,\n\nwe end up with roughly the wrong fermion mass relation me /m\u03bc \u223c\n= md /ms . The correct electron\n\n\f41\nand muon masses may in principle be generated via high-dimensional operators by introducing\nthe vector-like Higgs fields from the ac\u2032 sector [67]. Moreover, the suitable neutrino masses and\nmixings can be generated via the seesaw mechanism by choosing suitable Majorana mass matrix\nfor the right-handed neutrinos.\n\nVIII.\n\nA COMMENT ON MODULI STABILIZATION\n\nIn the previous section, it has been demonstrated that it possible to obtain Yukawa textures\nwhich can reproduce the observed fermion mass hierarchies and mixings (extrapolated at the unification scale). Although this is a very interesting result, it is clear from this analysis that the Yukawa\ncouplings depend on several parameters which are not determined within the model. Rather, random values for these parameters have been chosen by hand in order to fit the experimental results.\nThus, it is far from clear that this model in its current form can offer a completely satisfactory\nexplanation for the observed fermion mass hierarchies and mixings.\nGiven a concrete string model, the low-energy observables such as particle couplings and resulting masses are functions of the open and closed string moduli. In particular, we can see from the\nanalysis of the previous section that the Yukawa couplings depend on the position of each stack of\nbranes on the tori as well as on the K\u00e4hler moduli. Thus, if these moduli can be fixed dynamically,\nthen the possible Yukawa mass textures would be tightly constrained. Indeed, once these moduli\nare fixed, the only remaining freedom is in the Higgs sector, namely the specific linear combination\nof the six pairs of Higgs states which must be fine-tuned to produce the two Higgs eigenstates Hu\nand Hd of the MSSM.\nThe job of fixing the position of each stack of branes on each torus is equivalent to fixing the\nopen-string moduli. D-brane constructions typically have non-chiral open string states present in\nthe low-energy spectrum associated with the D-brane position in the internal space and Wilson\nlines. This results in adjoint or additional matter in the symmetric and antisymmetric representations unless the open string moduli are completely frozen. These light scalars are not observed\nand the succesful gauge unification in the MSSM would also be spoiled by their presence. While it\nmay be possible to find some scenarios where the problems created by these fields are ameliorated,\nit is much simpler to eliminate these fields altogether. One way to do this is to this is to construct\nintersecting D-brane models where the D-branes wrap rigid cycles, which was first explored in [16]\nand [17] in the context of Type II compactifications on T 6 /(Z2 \u00d7 Z\u20322 ) which is the only known\ntoroidal background which posseses such rigid cycles.\n\n\f42\nFor T 6 /(Z2 \u00d7 Z\u20322 ) the twisted homology contains collapsed 3-cycles. There are 16 fixed points,\n\nfrom which arise 16 additional 2-cycles with the topology of P1 \u223c\n= S 2 . As a result, there are 32\ncollapsed 3-cycles for each twisted sector. A D6-brane wrapping collapsed 3-cycles in each of the\nthree twisted sectors will be unable to move away from a particular position on the covering space\nT6 , and thus the 3-cycle will be rigid.\nA fractional D-brane wrapping both a bulk cycle as well as the collapsed cycles may be written\nin the form\n\u03a0Fa\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nX\nX\n1\n1\n1 B 1\uf8ed X \u03b8\n\u03b8\u03c9 \uf8f8\n\u01eb\u03c9a,jk \u03a0\u03c9jk,a \uf8f8 + \uf8ed\n\u01eba,ij \u03a0\u03b8ij,a \uf8f8 + \uf8ed\n\u01eb\u03b8\u03c9\n= \u03a0 +\na,ik \u03a0ik,a .

The constants \u01eb\u03b8a,ij , \u01eb\u03c9a,jk\nand \u01eb\u03b8\u03c9\na,ki denote the sign of the charge of the fractional brane with respect to the fields which are\npresent at the orbifold fixed points. We refer the reader to [17] for a detailed discussion of model\nbuilding on this background.\nLet us consider a local supersymmetric model consisting of three stacks of D6 branes wrapping\nfractional cycles with the bulk wrapping numbers and intersection numbers shown in Table XI. This\nmodel is essentially equivalent to the model we have been studying, modulo the fact that the D6\nbranes are now wrapping fractional cycles and there are no longer any flat directions for the openstring moduli. Thus, the positions of the D-branes are frozen since they are unable to move away\nfrom the fixed points. Phenomenologically, this is very desirable. First, the existence of the adjoint\nwhich results from unstablized open-string moduli can destroy the gauge-coupling unification and\nthe asymptotic freedom of SU (3)C . Second, fixing the open-string moduli means that there is\nlimited freedom in the values taken by the brane-shift parameters (\u01ebi of the previous section).\nAs we have seen, these parameters play a fundamental role in generating the mass hierarchies\nbetween up-type and down-type quarks, and the leptons. In addition, the open-string moduli must\nbe fixed in order to calculate parameters such as \u03bc and tan \u03b2 which play a very important role\nin determining the low-energy superpartner spectra and the Yukawa couplings. Finally, instanton\ninduced superpotential couplings may also be very important for addressing issues such as neutrino\nmasses, inflation and supersymmetry breaking. The Euclidean D-branes necessary for calculating\nsuch effects must wrap rigid cycles.\nIn order to have such rigid cycles, we must make a choice of discrete torsion which is related to\nthe sign of the orientifold planes. Namely, in order for the background to have discrete torsion, there\nmust be an odd number of O6(+,+) planes. Thus, the conditions necessary for tadpole cancellation\n\n\f43\n\nTABLE XI: D6-brane configurations and bulk intersection numbers for a local left-right model in Type\nIIA on the T6 /(Z2 \u00d7 Z\u20322 ) orientifold, where the D6-branes are wrapping rigid cycles.

The\nhidden sector will also be necessary to cancel twisted-tadpoles associated with the orbifold fixed\npoints.\nOf course, in the end, our strategy will be to construct the model in the T-dual picure involving\nmagnetized fractional D-branes, in the context of flux compactifications. Indeed, it is necessary\nto turn on fluxes in order to stabilize the closed-string moduli. In fact, one such model with an\nequivalent observable sector as the one we have been studying has been constructed as examples of\nsupersymmetric Type IIA Ads and Type IIB Minkowski flux vacua [36, 39]. The next step would\nthen be to combine these two sources of moduli stablization into a single construction with both\nopen and closed-string moduli stabilized. Hopefully, we would then be able to uniquely calculate\nboth the Yukawa couplings as well as the superpartner spectra. We are presently working on this,\nand hope to report on our progress in the near future.\n\n\f44\nIX.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have analyzed in detail a three-family intersecting D6-brane model where gauge coupling\nunification is achieved at the string scale and where the gauge symmetry can be broken to the\nStandard Model. In the model, it is possible to calculate the supersymmetry breaking soft terms\nand obtain the low energy supersymmetric particle spectra within the reach of the LHC. Finally,\nit is possible to obtain the SM quark masses and CKM mixings and the lepton masses, and the\nneutrino masses and mixings may be generated via the seesaw mechanism.\nClearly, this model cannot be regarded as being fully realistic until the moduli stablization\nissue has been fully addressed. There are many free parameters which have been fixed in order to\nobtain the desired values for the Yukawa mass matrices and the value of the gauge couplings at the\nunification scale, although it should be kept in mind that these parameters are tightly constrained\nand it is not possible to tune them to just any value. In the case of the Yukawa matrices, the\nfree parameters are the K\u00e4hler moduli, the brane positions on each torus (open-string moduli) and\nthe specific linear combination of states with which have been indentified the two pairs of Higgs\neigenstates. Although we have chosen specific values for the moduli fields to obtain agreement with\nexperiments, it may be possible to uniquely predict these values by introducing the most general\nfluxes. It might also be possible to fix the open string moduli if we require the D-branes wrap rigid\ncycles. However, it seems likely that the Higgs eigenstates would still need to be fine-tuned.\nOn the other hand, this does appear to be the first such string-derived model where it is possible\nto give mass to each family of quarks and leptons. Even if we cannot at present uniquely predict\nthese values, it must still be regarded as highly significant in that it is possible to come very close\nto getting correct mass matrices and mixings at the unification scale. This suggests that the model\nmay be a candidate for a phenomenological description of elementary particle physics in much the\nsame way as the MSSM.\nIt is also very appealing that the tree-level gauge couplings are unified at the string scale,\nalthough it is still an open question if the running of the gauge couplings can be maintained all\nthe way down to the electroweak scale. The reason for this is that there are chiral exotic states\npresent in the spectrum which are bifundamentals under the observable and hidden sector gauge\ngroups. We should note that most of these chiral exotic states can be decoupled at the string\nscale and the rest may may be decoupled at an intermediate scale. Even if this were not the\ncase, we have found that the hidden sector gauge interactions will become confining at around\n107 GeV and 1013 GeV respectively, and so states charged under these groups will not be present\n\n\f45\nin the low-energy spectrum. However, there are exotic states in the spectrum which transform as\nrepresentations of both the hidden and observable sectors which may effect the RGE running of\nthe gauge couplings, although we do not expect them to effect the running that much. If we are\noptimistic, then it is possible that these would amount to threshold corrections which might push\nthe unification scale up to the string scale.\nIf the model does turn out to be a realistic effective description of the observed elementary\nparticle physics, then it should be possible to predict the low-energy superpartner mass spectra\nfrom the model. Besides the D-brane wrapping numbers and closed-string moduli, the superpartner\nspectra depend strongly on the exact way in which supersymmetry is broken. In principle, it should\nbe possible to completely specify the exact mechanism, whether through gaugino condensation in\nthe hidden sector, flux-induced soft terms, or via instanton induced couplings. In the present\nanalysis, we have studied supersymmetry breaking generically via a generic parameterized F-term\nand have shown that it is possible to constrain the phenomenologically allowed parameter space\nby imposing experimental limits on the neutralino relic density and mass limits coming from LEP.\nWe have found that the viable parameter space is quite large. Once the experimentally determined\nsuperpartner mass spectrum begins to take shape it may be possible to find a choice of F-terms\nwhich will correspond to the observed spectrum. It would be very interesting to explore the collider\nsignatures which this model may produce at LHC for the regions of the parameter space which\nsatisfy all phenomenological constraints.\nIn summary, the model we have studied may produce a realistic phenomenology, once the\nissue of moduli stabilization has been fully addressed. The model represents the first known\nintersecting D-brane model for which mass may be given to each generation of quarks and leptons.\nFurthermore, the supersymmetry breaking soft terms may be studied in the model and may yield\nrealistic superpartner spectra. Certainly, the model and the current theoretical tools are not\npresently developed to the point where specific predictions for the known fermion masses and\nsuperpartner spectrum may be made. However, it is clearly possible for the model to describe the\nknown physics of the Standard Model, as well as potentially describing new physics.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis research was supported in part by the Mitchell-Heep Chair in High Energy Physics (CMC),\nby the Cambridge-Mitchell Collaboration in Theoretical Cosmology and by the Chinese Academy\nof Sciences under Grant KJCX3-SYW-N2(TL), and by the DOE grant DE-FG03-95-Er-40917.\n\n\f46\n\n[1] J.
