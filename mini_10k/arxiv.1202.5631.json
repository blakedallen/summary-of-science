Using the semiclassical trace formula, single-particle\nlevel density is expressed as the sum over contributions of\nclassical periodic orbits in the corresponding classical Hamiltonian system[1, 2]. The quantum fluctuations in many-body\nquantities such as energy and deformations are related to gross\nshell structure in single-particle spectra determined by some\nshort periodic orbits. Therefore, one can describe many-body\nquantum dynamics in terms of the properties of a few important classical periodic orbits. The single-particle shell structures are sensitively affected by varying potential parameters\nsuch as deformations, and we have found that bifurcations of\nshort periodic orbits play significant roles in emergence of remarkable shell effects. It is a quite interesting phenomena that\nthe regularity of quantum spectra is enhanced by the periodicorbit bifurcation, which is regarded as the precursor of chaos\nin classical dynamics. In this paper, we would like to show\nthat the above semiclassical mechanism for the enhancement\nof quantum shell effects would elucidate several problems in\nnuclear structure physics.\nAs phenomenological mean-field potentials, modified oscillator (MO) and Woods-Saxon (WS) models are successfully employed in shell correction approaches. For simpler\nand qualitative descriptions of the properties of shell structures, harmonic oscillator (HO) and infinite-well (cavity) potentials are frequently utilized for light and heavy systems,\nrespectively. Axially symmetric anisotropic HO potential\nmodels successfully explain the magic numbers of light nuclei, emergence of superdeformed shell structures, and so on.\nFor heavier nuclei, the radial profile of the potential around\nthe nuclear surface becomes more sharp and it looks more\nlike a square-well potential. In order to avoid the complexity of treating continuum states, the WS potential is sometimes approximated by an infinite-well potential (cavity). The\ncavity system, as well as the HO system, is integrable under spheroidal deformation due to the existence of a nontrivial dynamical symmetry, and several classical and quantum\n\nmechanical quantities are obtained analytically. It also accepts several useful techniques to calculate quantum eigenvalue spectra, since the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is equivalent to\nthe Laplace equation with Dirichlet boundary condition.\nThe HO and cavity systems have a significant difference in\ndeformed shell structures. In the axially-deformed HO system, the ways in which the degeneracy of levels is resolved,\ndue to prolate and oblate deformations, are nearly symmetric; namely, the level diagram vs deformation is symmetric\nunder rotation about the degenerate spherical point by angle\n\u03c0 . Due to this symmetry, many-body systems between adjacent closed-shell configurations will prefer prolate shapes in\nthe lower half shell and oblate shapes in the higher half shell,\nsince single-particle level density is lower there, and in total,\nprolate and oblate shapes are expected to occur in almost the\nsame ratios. On the other hand, the above kind of symmetry is\napparently broken in the cavity system. Such asymmetry has\nbeen considered as the origin of so called prolate-shape dominance in nuclear ground-state deformations: a well known experimental fact that most of the ground states of medium-mass\nto heavy nuclei have prolate shapes rather than oblate shapes.\nIts origin has been discussed since the discovery of the nuclear ground-state deformation[3\u20136]. This predominance has\nbeen reproduced theoretically in microscopic calculations. In\nHartree-Fock+BCS calculations with Skyrme interaction[4],\nmost of the deformed ground-state solutions are found to have\nprolate shapes. In order to pin down the essential parameter\nwhich causes prolate-shape dominance, systematic NilssonStrutinsky calculations throughout the nuclear chart have been\nmade[5], and the distribution of ground-state deformations is\nexamined by varying the strengths of l 2 and ls terms in the\nNilsson Hamiltonian. They found that the prolate-shape dominance is realized under strong correlation between l 2 and ls\nterms. The recent analysis by Takahara et al. based on WoodsSaxon-Strutinsky calculations also supports those results[6].\nHamamoto and Mottelson compared the oblate and prolate\ndeformation energy from the summation of single-particle energies with spheroidal HO and cavity models, and have shown\nthat the prolate-shape dominance is only found in the cavity model. They considered the origin of the prolate-shape\n\n\f2\ndominance to be the asymmetric manner of level fannings in\nprolate and oblate sides which is unique to a potential with\na sharp surface, and have shown that the above asymmetry\nis explained from the different roles of interaction between\nsingle-particle levels in prolate and oblate sides[7].\nWe expect that the semiclassical periodic-orbit theory\n(POT) holds the key for deeper understandings of above shell\nstructures responsible for prolate-shape dominance. In POT,\nsemiclassical level density is expressed as the sum of periodic\norbit (PO) contributions,\n\u0013\n\u0012\nS\u03b2 (E) \u03c0 \u03bc\u03b2\n.\n(1.1)\ng(E) = \u1e21(E) + \u2211 A\u03b2 (E) cos\n\u2212\n2\nh\u0304\n\u03b2\n\u1e21 is the average level density equivalent to that given by the\nThomas-Fermi approximation, and the second term on the\nright-hand side gives the fluctuations around \u1e21. The sum is\ntaken over all the classical\nperiodic orbits \u03b2 which exist for\nH\ngiven energy E. S\u03b2 = \u03b2 p * dr is the action integral, and \u03bc\u03b2 is\nthe geometric phase index determined by the number of conjugate points along the orbit. Each orbit \u03b2 changes its size\nand shape with increasing energy E, and the action integral\nS\u03b2 is, in general, a monotonically increasing function of E.\nThus, each cosine term in the PO sum (1.1) is a regularly oscillating function of energy whose period of oscillation \u03b4 E is\ngiven through the relation\n\n\u03b4 S\u03b2 \u223c\n\n\u2202 S\u03b2\n\u03b4 E \u223c 2\u03c0 h\u0304,\n\u2202E\n\n\u03b4E \u223c\n\n2\u03c0 h\u0304\n,\nT\u03b2\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhere T\u03b2 = \u2202 S\u03b2 /\u2202 E is time period of the orbit \u03b2 . Therefore,\na gross shell structure (large \u03b4 E) is associated with short periodic orbits (small T\u03b2 ).\nThe above fluctuation in the single-particle spectrum brings\nabout a fluctuation in energy of nuclei as functions of constituent nucleon numbers. This fluctuation part, which we call\nshell energy, is calculated by removing the smooth part from\na sum of single-particle energies by means of the Strutinsky\nmethod[8, 9]. In semiclassical theory, shell energy Esh (N) is\ngiven by the sum of periodic orbit contribution as[10]\nEsh (N) = \u2211\n\u03b2\n\n\u0012\n\nh\u0304\nT\u03b2\n\n\u00132\n\nS\u03b2 (EF (N)) \u03c0 \u03bc\u03b2\nA\u03b2 cos\n\u2212\n2\nh\u0304\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n, (1.3)\n\nwhere the Fermi energy EF (N) is determined by\nZ EF\n\ng(E)dE = N.\n\n(1.4)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nIn Eq. (1.3), the contributions of long orbits are suppressed\nby the reduction factor T\u03b2\u22122 , and the property of shell energy is essentially determined by a few shortest periodic orbits. Therefore, it is sufficient to examine coarse-grained level\ndensity where one can exclude the contribution of long periodic orbits.\nThe relation between coarse-grained quantum level density\noscillations and classical periodic orbits in the spherical cavity model was first discussed by Balian and Bloch[2]. They\n\nshow that the modulations in quantum level density oscillations are clearly understood as the interference effect of periodic orbits with different lengths. This idea has been successfully applied to the problem of supershell structure in metallic clusters[11]. Strutinsky et al.[12] applied periodic orbit\ntheory (POT)[1, 2] to the cavity model with spheroidal deformation and discussed the properties of deformed shell structures in medium-mass to heavy nuclei in terms of classical\nperiodic orbits[12]. Frisk made more extensive POT calculations to reproduce quantum level density by the semiclassical\nformula[13]. He also suggested the relation between classical periodic orbits and prolate-oblate asymmetry in deformed\nshell structures, which might be responsible for the prolateshape dominance discussed above. Those works have proved\nthe virtue of semiclassical POT for clear understanding of the\nproperties of finite quantum systems.\nIt should be emphasized here that unique deformed shell\nstructures are developed when the contributions of certain periodic orbits are considerably enhanced. The magnitude of the\nshell effect is related to the amplitude factor A\u03b2 in Eq. (1.1).\nThis amplitude factor has important dependency on the stability of the orbit, which is generally very sensitive to the potential parameters such as deformations. In particular, stability\nfactors sometimes exhibit significant enhancement at periodic\norbit bifurcations, where new periodic orbits emerge from an\nexisting periodic orbit. Near the bifurcation point, classical\norbits surrounding the stable periodic orbit form a quasiperiodic family, which makes a coherent contribution to the level\ndensity. This is an important mechanism for the growth of\ndeformed shell structures.\nA typical example is the so-called superdeformed shell\nstructure. It is known that single-particle spectra exhibit remarkable shell effects at very large quadrupole-type deformation with an axis ratio around 2:1. In the anisotropic HO\nmodel, this shell structure is related with the periodic orbit\ncondition; all the classical orbits become periodic at \u03c9\u22a5 = 2\u03c9z\nand they make very large contribution to the level density fluctuation. In the cavity model, one also finds a significant shell\neffect around the 2:1 deformation, and it is related to the bifurcations of equatorial periodic orbits through which threedimensional (3D) periodic orbits emerge[14, 15]. It should be\ninteresting to explore the intermediate situation between the\nabove two limits, which might correspond to the actual nuclear situation.\nOur purpose in this paper is to understand the transition of\ndeformed shell structure from light to heavy nuclei in terms\nof classical periodic orbits. This requires a mean field like\nWS potential model. Semiclassical quantizations in spherical and deformed WS-like potentials have been examined in\nRefs. [16, 17], but the relation between classical periodic orbits and quantum level densities has not been discussed. As\nwe show, the WS potential inside the nuclear radius RA is\nnicely approximated by a power-law potential which has simpler radial dependence V \u221d r\u03b1 . This approximation simplifies both quantum and classical calculations and one has clear\nquantum-classical correspondence via the Fourier transformation technique[18].\nThus, in the current paper, we focus on the radial dependence of the mean-field potential (effect of surface diffuse-\n\n\f3\n\nII. THE POWER-LAW POTENTIAL MODEL\nA.\n\nDefinition of the model\n\nIt is known that the central part of the nuclear mean-field\npotential is approximately given by the Woods-Saxon (WS)\nmodel,\nVWS (r) = \u2212\n\nW\n.\n1 + exp{(r \u2212 RA )/a}\n\n(2.1)\n\nThe depth of the potential is W \u2243 50 MeV, the surface diffuseness is a \u2243 0.7 fm and the nuclear radius is RA \u223c 1.3 A1/3 fm\nfor a nucleus with mass number A [19]. The singularity of the\npotential (2.1) at the origin can be removed by replacing the\nWS potential with the Buck-Pilt (BP) potential[20]\n1 + cosh(RA /a)\nVBP (r) = \u2212W\n.\ncosh(r/a) + cosh(RA /a)\n\n(2.2)\n\nBy using the BP potential whose radial profile is essentially\nequivalent to the WS potential, one can consider semiclassical\nquantization without being concerned about the singularity in\nclassical orbits[16, 17]. For small A, the inner region (r < RA )\nof these potentials can be approximated by a harmonic oscillator (HO). For large A, these potentials are flat (V \u2248 \u2212W )\naround r = 0 and sharply approaches zero around the surface,\nlooking more like a square-well potential. In Ref. [12], the\nshell energies of deformed WS potentials are compared with\nthose for HO and infinite square-well (cavity) potentials. Deformed shell structures in the WS model are similar to those of\nthe HO model for light nuclei, while they are more like those\nof the cavity model for medium-mass to heavy nuclei.

As pointed out by Tajima et\nal., spin-orbit coupling plays also an important role in prolateshape dominance. The effect of spin-orbit coupling will be\ndiscussed in a forthcoming paper.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec.

The inner region (r <\n\u223c R)\nof the BP potential is nicely approximated by the power-law\npotential (see Fig. 1).\nIn Fig. 1, the radial parameter \u03b1 is determined so that the\npower-law potential best fit the inner region (r < RA ) of the\nBP potential.

Since most of the classical orbits\nhave nonzero angular momentum and they do not reach the\nouter bound of the potential due to centrifugal potential, the\ndifference of the two potentials at r > RA is hindered in the\nsemiclassical quantization and it might not cause much differences in the quantum spectra up to a rather high energy.\nThus, we can employ this power-law potential model for the\nstudy of realistic shell structures of stable nuclei from light\nto heavy regions. For unstable nuclei, the difference of the\npotentials at r > RA and the effect of coupling to continuum\nstates might become significant.\n\nB. Scaling properties\n\nWe have several great advantages by replacing the WS/BP\npotential with the power-law potential. The power-law potential has useful scaling properties, which highly simplifies\nour semiclassical analysis. In the following, we eliminate the\nconstant term \u2212W in Eq. (2.3) and consider the Hamiltonian\nfor a particle of mass M moving in the deformed power-law\npotential as\n\u0015\u03b1\n\u0014\nr\np2\n.\n+U\nH(p, r) =\n2M\nR f (\u03b8 , \u03c6 )\n\nA\n20\n\n1\n4\u03c0\n\nf 3 (\u03b8 , \u03c6 )d \u03a9 = 1,\n\n(2.8)\n\nwhich guarantees the volume surrounded by equipotential surface to be independent of deformation. Under a suitable scale\ntransformation of coordinates, the energy eigenvalue equation\nis transformed into a dimensionless form,\n\u0014\n\u0013\u03b1 \u0015\n\u0012\n1 2\nu\n\u2212 \u2207u +\n\u03c8 (u) = e\u03c8 (u),\n(2.9)\n2\nf (\u03b8 , \u03c6 )\nby the choice U = h\u03042 /MR2 (note that the value of U can be\ntaken arbitrarily, since the potential can be still adjusted by\nanother parameter R), and dimensionless coordinates u and\nenergy e defined by\nu=\n\nr\n,\nR\n\ne=\n\nE\n.\nU\n\n(2.10)\n\n\u22072u represents a Laplacian with respect to the coordinate u.\nSince Eq. (2.9) does not include constants such as M, U, R and\nh\u0304, one can consider the quantum eigenvalue problem independently on those values. Their absolute values are determined\nby fitting to the BP potential through the relation\n\u0012 \u0013\u03b1\nW\nRA\n= .\nU\nR\n2\n\nThe values of \u03b1 , R and U for several A are listed in Table I.\nThe scaling property of the system is particularly advantageous in the analysis of classical dynamics. Since the potential is a homogeneous function of coordinates, Hamilton's\nequations of motion have invariance under the following scale\ntransformation:\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n(p, r,t) \u2192 (c 2 p, c \u03b1 r, c \u03b1 \u2212 2 t) as\n\nE \u2192 cE.\n\n(2.11)\n\nTherefore, classical phase-space structure is independent of\nenergy. A phase-space trajectory (r0 (t), p0 (t)) at energy E0 is\ntransformed to a trajectory at different energy E by\n\n(2.7)\n\nHere, R and U are constants having dimension of length and\nenergy, respectively. The dimensionless function f (\u03b8 , \u03c6 ) determines the shape of the equipotential surface, and it is nor-\n\nZ\n\nr(t) =\n\n\u0012\n\nE\nE0\n\n\u0013 \u03b11\n\nwith\n\n\u2032\n\nr0 (t ),\nt=\n\np(t) =\n\u0012\n\nE\nE0\n\n\u0012\n\nE\nE0\n\n\u0013 \u03b11 \u2212 12\n\n\u0013 12\n\nt \u2032.\n\np0 (t \u2032 ),\n(2.12)\n\n\f5\nThus we have the same set of periodic orbits in an arbitrary\nenergy surface related through the above scale transformation.\nIn the following, we set the reference energy at E0 = U.

One sees that\nETF (TF) correctly describes the average properties of quantum results. In these plots, the differences between ETF and\nTF are invisibly small.\nNext we consider the fluctuating part by the use of semiclassical periodic-orbit theory[10]. Let us rewrite the trace\nformula (1.1) using scaled energy and scaled periods.

For a system\nwith continuous symmetry, e.g., a particle moving in an axially symmetric potential, generic periodic orbits form a continuous family with respect to the symmetry transformation,\nand they are called degenerate orbits. For an isolated orbit \u03b2\nwith n repetitions, the amplitude factor is given by the standard Gutzwiller formula[1, 10],\nAn\u03b2 =\n\nT\u03b2\n\u03c4\u03b2\ndE\nq\n= q\n.

Comparison of quantum (QM: solid line) and semiclassical\n(ETF: broken line) results for a spherical power-law potential with\n\u03b1 = 4.0. In panel (a), coarse-grained quantum level density (2.22)\nwith smoothing width \u0393 = 0.3, and ETF level density (2.20) are displayed. In panel (b), the number of quantum levels below scaled\nenergy E (2.23) and the ETF average number of levels (2.21) are\ndisplayed.\n\nwhere (r\u22a5 (t), p\u22a5 (t)) are the local coordinates and momenta\nperpendicular to the periodic orbit \u03b2 as functions of time t,\nand T\u03b2 is the period of the primitive orbit.\nIn a two-dimensional autonomous Hamiltonian system,\nmonodromy matrix M is a (2 \u00d7 2) real and symplectic matrix,\n!\n0 1\nT\nM J M = J, J =\n,\n\u22121 0\nand its eigenvalues appear in one of the following three\nforms[10, 22]:\n(a) (eu , e\u2212u ): hyperbolic with no reflection, Tr M =\n2 cosh u > 2,\n(b) (eiv , e\u2212iv ): elliptic, Tr M = 2 cos v, | Tr M| \u2264 2,\n(c) (\u2212eu , \u2212e\u2212u ): hyperbolic with reflection, Tr M =\n\u22122 coshu < \u22122.\nThe orbit is stable in case (b) and otherwise unstable, and the\nstability of the orbit is determined by the trace of monodromy\nmatrix. The stability factor in Eq. (2.25) is also determined by\nthe trace of the monodromy matrix:\ndet(I \u2212 M\u03b2 ) = 2 \u2212 TrM\u03b2 .\n\n(2.27)\n\nM\u03b4 Z1 = \u03b4 Z1 .\n\n(2.28)\n\nIn this way, periodic orbit bifurcation occurs at Tr M = 2. The\nnumber of new emerging orbits is dependent on the type of\nthe bifurcation[23]. When a stable (unstable) orbit undergoes\npitchfork bifurcation, it turns unstable (stable) and a new stable (unstable) orbit emerges from it. When a stable orbit undergoes period-doubling bifurcation, a pair of stable and unstable orbits will emerge.\nIn a three-dimensional Hamiltonian system, the size of the\nmonodromy matrix becomes (4 \u00d7 4). Under axial symmetry, periodic orbits degenerate with respect to the rotation,\nand the monodromy matrix has unit eigenvalue corresponding to the direction of the rotation. Thus, by removing the\nrotational degrees of freedom, the stability of the orbit is described by a (2 \u00d7 2) symmetry-reduced monodromy matrix,\nand it has the same properties as in the two-dimensional case.\nFor such degenerate orbits in the system with continuous symmetry, the trace formula is modified by what is called extended\nGutzwiller theory[10, 24]. The amplitude factor for the degenerate orbit is proportional to the stability factor similar to\nthat in (2.25), but with symmetry-reduced monodromy matrix\nM\u0303\u03b2 . For fully degenerate orbits in an integrable system, one\ncan use the Berry-Tabor formula[25].\nIn general, the stability factor | det(I \u2212 M\u0303\u03b2n )|\u22121/2 has strong\ndependence on the deformation parameter, and is responsible for the sensitivity of shell structures to deformations. The\ndivergence of the Gutzwiller amplitude (2.25) based on the\nstandard stationary phase method can be remedied by improved treatment of the trace integral in phase space (e.g.,\nuniform approximations[26\u201328] and the improved stationaryphase method[15, 29]) and one can obtain finite amplitudes\nthrough the bifurcation processes. Those amplitudes sometimes show strong enhancement around the bifurcation points,\nsince the monodromy matrix has a unit eigenvalue there, and\na local family of quasi-periodic orbits is formed in the direction of the eigenvector \u03b4 Z1 belonging to the unit eigenvalue,\nwhich make a coherent contribution to the level density.\nOne should, however, note that the above enhancement is\nnot always found for every bifurcations. The significance of\nbifurcation depends on the normal form parameters which describe nonlinear dynamics around the periodic orbit at the bifurcation points. In Ref. [30], uniform approximation remedies the divergence problems which one encounters at bifurcation points in the standard stationary phase method, but the\nobtained amplitude show no enhancement around there. In\nRef. [31], we found very strong enhancement of amplitude\naround the bifurcation point for one certain orbit, but the same\ntype of bifurcation in another orbit shows no enhancement. In\nour previous studies, we have shown that significant growth\n\n\f7\nof shell effects at a certain deformation is related with bifurcations of simple short periodic orbits[14, 15, 29, 31, 32].\nD. Fourier transformation technique\n\nThe Fourier transformation technique is especially useful\nin studying classical-quantum correspondence in the system\nwith scale invariance. Let us consider the Fourier transform\nof scaled-energy level density\nF(\u03c4 ) =\n\nZ\n\ng(E)ei\u03c4 E e\u2212 2 (\u03b3 E ) dE.\n2\n\n1\n\n(2.29)\n\nIn the integrand, Gaussian damping factor is included in order\nto exclude the level density at high energy \u03b3 E \u226b 1 where the\nnumerically obtained single-particle spectra do not have good\nprecision.\nBy inserting the quantum level density g(E) = \u2211n \u03b4 (E \u2212 En )\ninto Eq. (2.29), one obtains\nF\n\nqm\n\n(\u03c4 ) =\n\n\u2211\n\ne\n\ni\u03c4 En \u2212 21 (\u03b3 En )2\n\n,\n\nare available. In the following, we take the units h\u0304 = M = R =\nU = 1 for simplicity. Taking the orbits in the (x, y) plane and\nsetting the z component of the angular momentum to lz = K,\nthe two-dimensional effective Hamiltonian in polar coordinates is written as\nH=\n\nrc =\n\n2\n\n\u2212 z\n1\n\u03b4\u03b3 (z) = \u221a\ne 2\u03b3 2 ,\n2\u03c0 \u03b3\n\n(2.32)\n\nwhich coincides with Dirac's delta function in the limit \u03b3 \u2192 0.\nThus, F(\u03c4 ) should be a function possessing successive peaks\nat the scaled periods of classical periodic orbits \u03c4 = n\u03c4\u03b2 . [In\nEq. (2.31), the argument E of the amplitude A(E) is formally\nreplaced with differential operator \u2212i\u2202\u03c4 . For an isolated orbit, the amplitude is a constant and the corresponding term\nin Eq. (2.31) becomes a simple Gaussian. For a degenerate\nfamily of degeneracy K, the amplitude is proportional to E K/2\nand the peak might not be exactly centered at the scaled action.] Therefore, by calculating the Fourier transform of the\nquantum mechanical level density, one can extract information on the significance of each periodic orbits contributing to\nthe semiclassical level density. The parameter \u03b3 implies the\nresolution of the periodic orbit in the Fourier transform. For\na better resolution, a larger number of good quantum energy\nlevels (up to Emax >\n\u223c 2/\u03b3 ) are required.\nIII. SPHERICAL POWER-LAW POTENTIALS\nA.

Bifurcation enhancement effect to the shell structures\n\nIn order to see the effect of bifurcations of orbits (7,3),\n(5,2), and (3,1), we examine the shell structures at \u03b1 = 4.0,\n5.0, and 8.0 where the Fourier amplitudes corresponding to\nthe above orbits are most enhanced. Figure 6 shows the moduli of Fourier amplitudes |F(\u03c4 )| for the above values of radial\nparameter \u03b1 (the cross sectional view in Fig. 5 along the vertical lines at those values of \u03b1 ). Figure 7 shows the oscillating\npart of the coarse-grained level densities with two choices of\nsmoothing parameter, \u0393 = 0.24 for extracting only the gross\nshell structures and \u0393 = 0.12 for additional finer structures.\nIn Fig. 6(a), one sees the largest (except for \u03c4 = 0) peak\nat \u03c4 \u223c 16.5, which corresponds to the third repetitions of\nthe circular orbit, 3C (3\u03c4C = 16.539), as well as orbit (7,3)\n(\u03c47,3 = 16.410) bifurcated from 3C at \u03b1 = 31/9 = 3.44.

II D, the Fourier transform of scaledenergy level density g(E) will exhibit peaks at the scaled periods n\u03c4\u03b2 of classical periodic orbits. We calculate the quantum\nspectra by smoothly varying the radial parameter \u03b1 , and take\nthe Fourier transform of the level density for each \u03b1 . The\nFourier amplitude as a function of \u03b1 and scaled period \u03c4 is\nshown in Fig. 5. The scaled periods of classical periodic orbits are also drawn as functions of \u03b1 . One finds an excellent correspondence between Fourier peaks and classical periodic orbits. The peak at \u03c4 = 0 corresponds to the average\nlevel density, which in semiclassical theory is derived from\nthe contribution of the zero-length or direct trajectory. Equally\nspaced remarkably large peaks for \u03b1 = 2 are of a fully degenerate periodic orbit family (and its repetitions) in an isotropic\nharmonic oscillator [limit of SU(3) symmetry]. If the \u03b1 is\nslightly shifted from this value, the orbit family bifurcates into\ncircular orbit and diametric orbit families. With increasing\n\u03b1 , the circular orbit and its repetitions encounter successive\nbifurcations at the values given by Eq. (3.8).

In panel (a), dots are placed with interval \u03b4 E = 0.38,\nwhich approximately coincide with the positions of level density\nmaxima.

The dots in panels (b) and (c) are placed with intervals\n\u03b4 E = 0.54 and 0.97, respectively, which also coincide with the positions of level density maxima. (Physically, the level density minima\nhave more significance, but the supershell structures are clearer for\nthe maxima in these plots.)\n\nFIG. 8. Shell energy for (a) \u03b1 = 4.0, (b) 5.0, and (c) 8.0, as functions of the cubic root of particle number, taking account of the spin\ndegeneracy factor.\n\norbits are expected to make dominant contributions in the periodic orbit sum (2.24), and the pitch of the level density oscillation should be given by \u03b4 E = 2\u03c0 /\u03c4\u03b2 \u2248 0.38. The oscillating level density shown in Fig. 7(a) has the period of oscillation just as predicted above. One also note that the oscillation\nis regularly modulated and the amplitude becomes relatively\nlarge for every three oscillations. This is a typical supershell\nstructure caused by the interference of period-3 and period-1\norbits.\nIn Fig. 6(b), one sees a prominent peak at \u03c4 \u2243 11.6 associated with the second repetitions of the circular orbit, 2C\n(2\u03c4C = 11.690), as well as orbit (5,2) (\u03c45,2 = 11.609) bifurcated from 2C at \u03b1 = 4. The contribution of these orbit to\nthe level density should be the oscillating function of scaled\nenergy E with the period \u03b4 E \u2248 0.54. The oscillating level density shown in Fig. 7(b) has just the same period as predicted\nabove. One also notes that the supershell structure caused by\nthe interference of period-2 and period-1 orbits is manifested.\nIn Fig. 6(c), one sees a large peak at \u03c4 \u223c 6.5 associated with\nthe primitive circular orbit C (\u03c4C = 6.499) and the orbit (3,1)\n(\u03c43,1 = 6.479) bifurcated from C at \u03b1 = 7. The contributions\nof these orbits bring about the oscillation of the level density\nwith period \u03b4 E \u2248 0.97. The calculated quantum level density\nin Fig. 7(c) shows the behavior just as expected.\nThe above shell and supershell structures are also reflected\nin the shell energy shown in Fig. 8. In panels (a) and (b),\nthe subshell structures due to period-3 and period-2 orbits, respectively, can be found for large N (N 1/3 >\n\u223c 6), although they\nare not so evident in comparison with those found in the level\ndensity due to the reduction factor T\u03b2\u22122 in the trace formula\nof shell energy (1.3). In panel (c) of Fig. 8, one sees a remarkable enhancement of major shell effects compared with\nthe other panels. This is regarded as the result of bifurcation\nenhancement effect of the circular orbit.

Unfortunately, the subshell structures\nfor \u03b1 = 4.0 and 5.0 in shell energies are not very prominent in\nthe existing nuclear region and they might disappear, e.g., after including the spin-orbit coupling, but the pronounced shell\neffect for \u03b1 \u223c 8.0 might survive and be responsible for enhancement of shell effects in real nuclei around the mediummass to heavy region.\n\nIV. SPHEROIDAL DEFORMATIONS\nShape parametrization and quantum spectra\n\nAn axially symmetric anisotropic harmonic oscillator potential system is integrable, and it has a spheroidal equipotential surface. It is known that a spheroidal deformed cavity (infinite well potential) system is also integrable. For spheroidal\ndeformation, the shape function is expressed as\n\"\n\ncos2 \u03b8\nsin2 \u03b8\n+\nf (\u03b8 ) =\n(R\u22a5 /R0 )2 (Rz /R0 )2\n\n#\u22121/2\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0\n\u03b4\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nFIG. 9.

Taking account of the volume conservation condition R2\u22a5 Rz = R30 , we\ndefine the deformation parameter \u03b4 as\nR\u22a5 = R0 e\u2212\u03b4 /3 ,\n\nRz = R0 e2\u03b4 /3 .\n\n(4.2)\n\nIt is related to the axis ratio \u03b7 = Rz /R\u22a5 by \u03b7 = e\u03b4 . The\nspherical shape \u03b7 = 1 corresponds to \u03b4 = 0 and prolate/oblate\nsuperdeformed shapes \u03b7 = 2\u00b11 correspond to \u03b4 = \u00b1 ln 2 \u2248\n\u00b10.69. The system with spheroidal power-law potential is\nnonintegrable except for two limits, \u03b1 = 2 (HO) and \u03b1 = \u221e\n(cavity). In Fig. 9, we show the Poincar\u00e9\n\u221a surface of section\nfor \u03b1 = 2, 5, 20, and \u221e, each with \u03b7 = 3 (\u03b4 \u2248 0.49). It is\nfound that some complex structures emerge in the Poincar\u00e9\nplots with increasing \u03b1 > 2, and the surface becomes most\nchaotic around \u03b1 \u223c 20, then it turns into simpler structure for\nextremely large \u03b1 .\nFigure 10 shows the single-particle spectra as functions of\nspheroidal deformation parameter \u03b4 . The value of radial parameter is put at \u03b1 = 5.0, corresponding to medium-mass nuclei. The degeneracies of levels at the spherical shape are resolved and shell structure changes with varying deformation.\nThe level diagram is similar to what is obtained for MO or\nWS/BP models without spin-orbit coupling. One of its characteristic features in comparison with the HO model is the\nasymmetry of deformed shell structures in prolate and oblate\nsides. This asymmetry becomes more pronounced for larger\n\u03b1 , and it might be regarded as the origin of prolate-shape dominance in nuclear ground-state deformations. We shall discuss\nthe semiclassical origin of the above asymmetry in the follow-\n\n\f11\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n\u03b1=5,\u03b22=0.3\n\n1\n\npx\n\n1\n\npx\n\ntion. Although the properties of classical motion are quite different from those in spheroidal potential, the deformed shell\nstructures are very similar to each other. Thus, the above\ndifference of shape parametrization does not cause a serious\ndifference in the gross shell structures at normal deformations. Notable effects of chaoticity in the quadrupole potential can only be seen in the strong level repulsions at large\ndeformations \u03b22 >\n\u223c 0.3. Therefore, we shall only consider the\nspheroidal deformation in the following analysis.\n\n\u03b1=5,\u03b22=0.4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-1\n-1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n0\nx\n\nx\n\n1\n\nB.

Comparing with the Fig. 9(b), one\nwill see that the particle motions in the quadrupole potential\nare more chaotic than those in the spheroidal potential.\nFigure 12 shows the level diagram for quadrupole deforma-\n\n10\n\n8\n\n\u03b5\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n-0.6\n\nLet us examine the properties of deformed shell structures\nin the normal deformation region (|\u03b4 | <\n\u223c 0.3). As shown in\nFigs. 10 and 12, single-particle spectra in a potential with a\nsharp surface show prolate-oblate asymmetry (in the sense\ndiscussed in Sec. I). Hamamoto and Mottelson[7] paid attention to the different ways of level fanning (from the terminology used in Ref. [7]) in oblate and prolate sides; level fanning\nis considerably suppressed in the oblate side as compared to\nthe prolate side. Due to that suppression of level fanning, shell\nstructures in the oblate shapes are similar to those of the spherical shape, and the system has a smaller chance to gain shell\nenergy by means of oblate deformation. This may explain the\nfeature of prolate-shape dominance. They have shown that\nthe above asymmetric way of level fanning can be understood\nfrom the interaction between single-particle levels, which acts\nto suppress the level repulsions in the oblate side for a potential with sharp surface. It clearly explains the fact that the\nasymmetry becomes more pronounced for heavier nuclei, e.g.,\nin the Woods-Saxon model[12]. The same kind of asymmetry\nis also found in the spectrum of the Nilsson model.\nIn the spheroidal power-law potential model, the asymmetry in level fanning becomes more pronounced for larger \u03b1 as\nexpected. In Fig. 13(b), fannings of some nl levels (n and l\nrepresent principal and azimuthal quantum numbers, respectively) are illustrated for \u03b1 = 5.0. One sees that the level fannings are considerably suppressed in the oblate side as in the\ncavity potential.\nIt is interesting to note that, if we take the radial parameter \u03b1 < 2 (although it does not correspond to actual nuclear\nsituations), the way of level fanning becomes just opposite to\nthe case of \u03b1 > 2. As one sees in Fig. 13(a), level spreading\nis suppressed in the prolate side. We will discuss later if it\ncauses oblate-shape dominance.\nFollowing the analysis in Ref. [7], we calculate the deformation energy\nEdef (A, \u03b4 ) = E(A, \u03b4 ) \u2212 E(A, 0)\n\n\u03b1=5.0\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0\n\u03b22\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nFIG. 12.

Here, we assume the same single-particle spectra for neutrons and protons and only consider N = Z eveneven nuclei for simplicity.

As in usual, we can expect that the above oscillating part represents the correct quantum shell effect of a\nmany-body system. In Strutinsky's shell correction method,\nthe smooth part is replaced with the phenomenological liquid\ndrop model (LDM) energy to get the total many-body energy,\nbut here we try to extract the smooth part also from the singleparticle energies. In mean-field approximation, the single particle Hamiltonian is written as\n\u0125 = t\u02c6 + \u00fb,\n\n(4.6)\n\nwhere t\u02c6 and \u00fb represent kinetic energy and mean-field potential, respectively, and \u00fb is currently given by the power-law\npotential. In this case, by the use of the Virial theorem, the\naverage of t\u02c6 and \u00fb are in the ratio 2ht\u02c6i = \u03b1 h\u00fbi, and one obtains\nht\u02c6i =\n\n\u03b1\nh\u0125i,\n\u03b1 +2\n\nh\u00fbi =\n\n2\nh\u0125i.\n\u03b1 +2\n\n(4.7)\n\nTherefore, the smooth (average) part of the A-body energy is\ngiven approximately by\n+\n*\n\u03b1 +1\n1\n\u1ebcsp (A)\n(4.8)\n\u1ebc(A) \u2248 \u2211 t\u02c6i + \u2211 \u00fbi =\n2\n\u03b1 +2\ni\ni\nThis expression will be valid for many-body systems interacting with two-body interaction.

For \u03b1 > 2 [panels (c) and (d) of Fig. 14],\nthe deformation energies in the prolate side become considerably lower than in the oblate side as the radial parameter \u03b1 becomes larger. The power-law potential model thus reproduce\ncorrectly the feature of prolate-shape dominance in nuclear\ndeformation.\nFor \u03b1 < 2, as shown in Fig. 14(a), we find no indication\nof oblate-shape dominance in spite of the feature of level fanning shown in Fig. 13(a). One finds some lowest energy states\nat oblate shapes \u03b4 \u223c \u22120.3, but the difference in energies between prolate and oblate minima are generally small. Therefore, one cannot fully explain the prolate(oblate)-shape dominance only by the ways of level fanning.\nIn order to analyze shape stability, we define shelldeformation energy using the smooth part of the energy at\nspherical shape as a reference,\n\u2206E(A, \u03b4 ) = E(A, \u03b4 ) \u2212 \u1ebc(A, 0),\n\n(4.10)\n\nwith Eqs.

Thus, for an understanding of prolate-shape\ndominance, it is critical to explain the asymmetric behavior of\nthe slopes of the energy valleys.\nSince shell energy takes a deep negative value when the\nsingle-particle level density at the Fermi energy is low, let us\ninvestigate the coarse-grained single-particle level density as\nfunctions of energy and deformation. Figure 16 shows the\noscillating part of course-grained single-particle level density\n\n\f14\nfor \u03b1 = 1.1 and 5.0 plotted as functions of deformation \u03b4 and\nscaled energy E. They show regular ridge-valley structures\nsimilar to the shell energy. Therefore, for an understanding\nof prolate-shape dominance, it is essential to investigate the\norigin of the above ridge-valley structures in the deformed\nsingle-particle level density. For the spheroidal cavity potential, Frisk ascribed it to the change of the action integrals along\nthe triangular and rhomboidal orbits in the meridian plane, for\nwhich the volume conservation condition plays an important\nrole[13]. We are going to study the case of the more realistic\npower-law potential.\nIn the following subsections, we will show that the above\nridge-valley structure can be explained in connection with\nclassical periodic orbits using semiclassical periodic-orbit theory. The thick solid curves in Figs. 15 and 16 represent the\nsemiclassical prediction of the valley lines which will be discussed in Sec. IV D.\nC. Periodic orbits in spheroidal potential\n\nIn order to examine the semiclassical origin of the above\nasymmetry in a deformed shell structure using periodic orbit\ntheory, we first consider the properties of classical periodic\norbits in the spheroidal power-law potential and their bifurcations. For the spherical potential, all the periodic orbits are\nplanar and degenerate with respect to rotations. The degree\nof degeneracy for the orbit family is described by degeneracy parameter K which represents the number of independent\ncontinuous parameters required to specify a certain orbit in\nthe family. The maximum value of K is equal to the number of independent symmetric transformations of the system.\nThe isolated orbits have K = 0. In the spherical cavity potential, degeneracy parameter is K = 3 for generic periodic\norbits, and K = 2 for diametric and circular orbits which are\ntransformed onto themselves by one of the rotations. If the\nspheroidal deformation is added to the potential, generic planar orbits bifurcate into two branches: One is the orbit in the\nequatorial plane and the other is the orbit in the meridian plane\n(the plane containing the symmetry axis). All but two exceptional orbits degenerate with respect to the rotation about the\nsymmetry axis, and the degeneracy parameter is K = 1. The\ndiametric orbit bifurcate into degenerate family of equatorial\ndiametric orbits (K = 1) and an isolated diametric orbit along\nthe symmetry axis (K = 0). The circular orbit bifurcates into\nan isolated equatorial circular orbit (K = 0) and an oval-shape\norbit in the meridian plane (K = 1). With increasing deformation towards prolate side (\u03b4 > 0), the equatorial orbits undergo successive period m-upling bifurcations and new 3D orbits emerge. In the oblate side, the diametric orbit along the\nsymmetry axis undergoes successive period m-upling bifurcations and generates new meridian-plane orbits. These newborn 3D and meridian-plane orbits have hyperbolic caustics\nand are sometimes called hyperbolic orbits.\nIt is very interesting to note that the above new-born hyperbolic orbits from equatorial orbits are distorted towards\nthe symmetry axis with increasing deformation and finally\nsubmerge into the diametric orbit along the symmetry axis.\n(Some 3D orbits submerge into other hyperbolic orbits before\n\nsubmerging into the symmetry-axis orbit at last.) In this way,\nthe hyperbolic orbits make bridges between the equatorial and\nsymmetry-axis orbits, and we shall call those hyperbolic orbits \"bridge orbits\"[33, 34]. With increasing \u03b4 , periods of the\nequatorial orbit decrease while that of the symmetry-axis orbit\nincreases. At each crossing point of the periods (or actions)\nof repeated equatorial and symmetry-axis orbits, bridge orbits\nexist to intervene between them.\nAccordingly, we shall classify periodic orbits in the\nspheroidal power-law potential into the following four groups:\ni) Isolated orbits (K = 0): This group consists of the diametric orbit along the symmetry axis (z-axis), denoted\nZ, and the circular orbit in the equatorial plane, denoted\nEC. Orbit EC is stable both in the prolate and oblate\nsides, whose repeated period m-upling bifurcations generate 3D bridge orbits. Orbit Z is stable in the oblate\nside and undergoes successive period m-upling bifurcations, while its stability alternates in the prolate side\nwith repeated bifurcations which absorb bridge orbits.\nii) Equatorial-plane orbits (K = 1): This corresponds to\nthe equatorial-plane branch of the deformation-induced\nbifurcation. They have the same shapes as those in the\nspherical potential shown in Fig. 4. They are denoted\nE(k, m), where k is the number of vertices (corners) and\nm is the number of rotation. The diametric orbit is specially denoted X (which includes the orbits along the x\naxis).\niii) Meridian-plane orbits (K = 1): This corresponds to the\nmeridian-plane branch of the deformation-induced bifurcation. They survive up to any large deformation,\nkeeping their original geometries.\niv) Bridge orbits (K = 1): These orbits emerge from the\nbifurcations of equatorial orbits. Meridian-plane orbits\nemerge from diametric orbits and submerge into repetitions of orbit Z. Nonplanar 3D orbits emerge from nondiametric equatorial orbits, and they also submerge into\nthe orbit Z. Some of them submerge into other bridge\norbits before submerging into Z. The meridian-plane\nbridge which rests between mX (mth repetition of X)\nand nZ (nth repetition of Z) is denoted M(m, n). Except for the M(1,1) bridge, a pair of stable and unstable bridge orbits emerge, and are denoted M(m, n)s and\nM(m, n)u , respectively. 3D bridge B(m, m, n) emerges\nvia pitchfork bifurcation of equatorial mEC (mth repetitions of EC), and submerges into M(m, n) orbit before finally submerging into nZ. The other 3D bridges\nintervening between equatorial E(k, m) and nZ emerge\nas a stable and unstable pair, and are denoted as\nB(k, m, n)s,u . With increasing deformation, they first\nsubmerge into 3D bridge B(m, m, n), which will submerge into M(m, n) and finally into nZ.\nFigure 17 shows the bifurcation diagram for bridge orbit\nM(1,1) for \u03b1 = 3.0.

Traces of the symmetry-reduced monodromy matrix M\u0303 are plotted as functions of deformation parameter \u03b4 . Bifurcation points (Tr M\u0303 = 2) are indicated by open circles.\nShapes of the periodic orbits as well as the equipotential surface are\nalso shown.\n\nof equatorial diameter orbits X undergoes pitchfork bifurcation at \u03b4 = \u22120.34 and a family of oval-shape meridian-plane\norbits M(1,1) emerge. In the limit \u03b4 \u2192 0, the shape of the\nM(1,1) orbit approaches a circle, and it associates with equatorial circular orbit EC to form a K = 2 family. At \u03b4 > 0 it\nbifurcates into an equatorial EC and a meridian M(1,1) family again. The meridian branch submerges into the orbit Z at\n\u03b4 = 0.34 via pitchfork bifurcation. Thus, the orbits M(1,1)\nmake a bridge between two diametric orbits X and Z.\nIn the HO limit, \u03b1 \u2192 2, the bridge shrinks to a crossing\npoint of X and Z orbits and can exist only at \u03b4 = 0 (spherical\nshape), where they altogether form a degenerate K = 2 family.\nWith increasing \u03b1 , the bridge orbit exists in a wider range\nof deformation over the crossing point. In the cavity limit,\n\u03b1 \u2192 \u221e, this orbit approaches the so-called creeping orbit or\nwhispering gallery orbit, which runs along the boundary.\n\nD. Semiclassical origin of prolate-oblate asymmetry\n\nTo see the effect of the above bifurcation on the shell structure, we calculate Fourier transform of level density (2.30)\nwith the obtained quantum spectra. In Fig. 18, modulus of\nFourier transform |F(\u03c4 , \u03b4 )| is shown in a gray-scale plot as a\nfunction of deformation \u03b4 and scaled period \u03c4 . Scaled periods\nof classical periodic orbits \u03c4\u03b2 (\u03b4 ) are also drawn by lines. One\nsees a nice correspondence between the quantum Fourier amplitude and classical periodic orbits. Particularly, one can find\nsignificant peaks along the bridge orbit M(1,1), which indicate that the shell structure in the normal deformation region\nis mainly determined by the contribution of this bridge orbit.\nLet us assume that a contribution of single orbit (or degen-\n\nfor bridge orbit M(1,1). We see that the constant-action lines\nof the bridge orbit nicely explain the ridge-valley structure\nin the quantum level density. The slight disagreement of\nconstant-action lines and the bottom of the energy valleys\nmight be due to interference between other PO contributions.\nThe shell energy is also given by the periodic-orbit contribution as\n\n\u03b4 E(N) \u2248\n\nA\u03b2\ncos[EF (N)\u03c4\u03b2 \u2212 \u03c02 \u03bd\u03b2 ],\n\u03c4\u03b22\n\n(4.14)\n\nwhere EF represents Fermi level, which is approximately\ngiven by\nEF (N) \u2248 [3N/c0 (\u03b1 )]\n\n1/3\n\n(4.15)\n\nwhich is derived from the leading term of Eq. (2.21). Thus,\nthe shell energy takes large negative values along the constantaction lines for dominant orbit \u03b2 :\nEF \u2248\n\n\u0012\n\n3 A\nc0 (\u03b1 ) 4\n\n\u00131/3\n\n=\n\n(2n + 1 + 21 \u03bd\u03b2 )\u03c0\n.\n\u03c4\u03b2 (\u03b4 )\n\n(4.16)\n\nIn Fig. 15, we also plot the above constant-action lines for\nbridge orbits M(1,1) with thick solid lines. They satisfactorily explain the valley lines of shell energy. Distribution of\ndeformed shell energy minima in Fig. 15 are thus understood\nas the effect of bridge orbit contribution.\nFor \u03b1 > 2, bridge orbits appear upward from the crossing\npoint of two diametric orbits X and Z in the (\u03b4 , \u03c4 ) plane. Note\nthat the scaled action of orbit Z has a larger slope than that of\norbit X in the (\u03b4 , \u03c4 ) plane. This difference comes from the fact\nthat the lengths of semiaxes Rz and R\u22a5 in a volume-conserved\nspheroidal body are proportional to the different powers of\ndeformation parameter \u03b4 as in Eq. (4.2). The scaled period\nof the diametric orbit along the ith axis is proportional to the\nlength of corresponding semiaxis Ri ,\n\n\u03c4i = \u03c40D\n\nRi\n,\nR0\n\nwhere \u03c40D is the scaled period of the diametric orbit at spherical shape.

Superdeformed shell structures\nFIG. 18. (Color online) Modulus of the Fourier transform of the\nlevel density is shown by gray-scale plot as a function of deformation\nparameter \u03b4 and scaled period \u03c4 . Scaled periods of classical periodic\norbits are also displayed.\n\nTherefore, the bridge between X and Z orbits has a large slope\nin the prolate side while it is almost flat in the oblate side. This\nclearly explains the profile of ridge-valley structures in level\ndensity and shell energy. With increasing \u03b1 , triangular- and\nsquare-type orbits emerge at \u03b1 = 7 and 14, respectively, via\nthe isochronous bifurcations of the circular orbit [see Eq. (3.8)\nfor m = 1] for spherical shape. With spheroidal deformation,\nthey bifurcate into equatorial and meridian branches, which\nare both singly degenerated due to the axial symmetry. For\nfinite \u03b1 , they submerge into oval orbits and finally into diametric orbits at large deformations. In this sense, they are also\nbridge orbits intervening between two diametric orbits. These\nmeridian orbits survive up to larger deformation with increasing \u03b1 , and in the cavity limit (\u03b1 \u2192 \u221e), they survive for any\nlarge deformation. Therefore, the meridian orbits in the cavity\npotential can be regarded as a limit of bridge orbits. Thus we\nsee that Frisk's argument for a spheroidal cavity system[13] is\ncontinuously extended to the case of finite diffuseness.\n\nIn the axially deformed harmonic oscillator (HO) potential\nmodel, one sees simultaneous degeneracy of many energy levels at rational axis ratios. The HO model is often used for the\nnuclear mean-field potential in the limit of light nuclei. In\nthe HO model, superdeformation is explained as the result of\nstrong level bunching at axis ratio 2:1. A search for much\nlarger deformation originated from the strong level bunching at axis ratio 3:1 (sometimes referred to as hyperdeformation) has also been a challenging experimental and theoretical problem. On the other hand, the spheroidal cavity model,\nwhich is used as the limit of potential for heavy nuclei, also\nshows superdeformed shell structures, while the shell effect\nis much weaker than that found in the oscillator model. In\nthe spheroidal cavity model, superdeformed shell structures\nare intimately related with emergence of meridian and 3D orbits which oscillate twice in the short axis direction while they\noscillate once in the long-axis direction, just as the degenerate 3D orbits in the 2:1 axially-deformed HO potential[14].\nOne may expect to have a unified semiclassical understanding\nof the origin of superdeformed shell structures found in the\nabove two limiting cases by connecting them with the powerlaw potential model.\nFigure 19 shows the oscillating part of the coarse-grained\nlevel density for radial parameter \u03b1 = 5.0 and deformation\n\n\f17\n5\n4\n3\n2\n\n~\nTrM\n\n\u03b4 around a superdeformed region. It clearly show that new\nregularities in shell structure are formed at a superdeformed\nregion. The valley lines are up-going till \u03b4 \u223c 0.5, and they\nbend down around \u03b4 \u223c 0.6. One sees another deep minima at\n\u03b4>\n\u223c 0.7. Let us examine their semiclassical origins.\nFor \u03b1 > 2, one finds bridge orbits M(2,1) which intervenes\nbetween orbits 2X (second repetitions of X) and Z. Figure 20\nis the bifurcation diagram for the orbits relevant to this bifurcation, calculated for \u03b1 = 3.0. The orbit X undergoes a\nperiod-doubling bifurcation at \u03b4 = 0.55 and there emerges a\npair of bridge orbits M(2, 1)s (stable) and M(2, 1)u (unstable).\nThey have shapes of a boomerang and a butterfly as shown in\nFig. 20. With increasing \u03b4 , those orbits are distorted toward\nthe z axis and finally submerge into the orbit Z at different\nvalues of \u03b4 via pitchfork bifurcations.\nFor larger \u03b1 , various equatorial orbits appear as shown in\nFig. 4, and they also undergo bifurcations by imposing deformation. Each of those bifurcations will generate a pair of 3D\nbridge orbits, which are also distorted toward the symmetry\naxis by increasing \u03b4 and finally submerge into Z. Figure 21\nshows some 3D bridge orbits important for superdeformed\nshell structures for \u03b1 = 5.0. Equatorial circular orbit EC undergoes a period-doubling bifurcation, which is peculiar to 3D\nsystems, and generates 3D bridge orbit B(2,2,1). Equatorial\norbit E(5,2) undergoes a nongeneric period-doubling bifurcation and a pair of 3D bridge orbits B(5, 2, 1)s,u emerge. All the\nabove 3D orbits finally submerge into the Z orbit by increasing\ndeformation \u03b4 . See the Appendix for a detailed description of\nthese 3D bridge orbit bifurcations.\nFigure 22 shows the Fourier transform of scaled-energy\nlevel density for \u03b1 = 5.0 around a superdeformed region. The\nscaled periods of classical periodic orbits are also drawn with\nlines. The Fourier amplitude shows remarkable enhancement\nalong the bridge orbits M(2,1) and B(5,2,1), indicating their\nsignificant roles in superdeformed shell structures.\nThe constant action lines (4.13) for M(2,1) and B(2,2,1)\nare shown in Fig. 19 with thick solid and broken lines. They\nperfectly explain the ridge-valley structures of quantum level\ndensities. This shows the significant roles of bifurcations\nof M(2,1) and B(n, 2, 1) orbits for enhanced shell effects at\n\u03b4 \u223c 0.5 and 0.7, respectively.\nM(2,1) and B(2,2,1) orbits shrink to the crossing point of\n2X (2EC) and Z orbits in the HO limit, \u03b1 \u2192 2, and turn into a\nK = 4 degenerate family. With increasing \u03b1 , the deformation\nrange in which a bridge orbit can exist becomes wider. Therefore, the bifurcation deformation of the orbits 2X and 2EC\nbecomes smaller with increasing \u03b1 , and the effect of these\norbits takes place at smaller deformation. This may explain\nthe experimental fact that deformations of the superdeformed\nstates are smaller for heavier nuclei; e.g., \u03b22 \u223c 0.6 for the Dy\nregion and \u03b22 = 0.4\u20130.5 for the Hg region[35, 36]. In the cavity limit \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e, the two meridian orbits M(2,1) and the two\n3D orbits B(n,2,1) respectively join to form K = 1 families,\nwhich survive for arbitrary large deformations.[14, 37]\nIn conclusion, the highly degenerate family of orbits in the\nrational HO potential (\u03b1 = 2) are resolved at \u03b1 > 2 into two\norbits: equatorial and symmetry-axis orbits that have fewer\ndegeneracies, and the bridge orbit which mediates between\nthem within a finite deformation range.

Our results elucidate that the essence of the\nsemiclassical origin of prolate-shape dominance in the cavity\nmodel also applies to the more realistic power-law potential\nmodel. The semiclassical origin of superdeformed shell structures which have been discussed separately for oscillator and\ncavity models are continuously connected via bridge orbits in\npower-law potential models.\nIn this paper we have explored the contribution of periodic orbits via Fourier transform of the quantum level density. In order to clarify the role of periodic-orbit bifurcation\nto the level density, it is important to establish a semiclassical\nmethod with which we can evaluate contribution of classical\nperiodic orbits in the bifurcation region. Some preliminary results for the spherical power-law potential using the improved\nstationary phase method have been reported in Ref. [38]. Application of a uniform approximation to this problem is also\nin progress.\nAnother important subject is the inclusion of spin degrees\nof freedom. Since the nuclear mean field has strong spin-orbit\ncoupling, it should be crucial to take account of its effect to\nanalyze realistic nuclear shell structures. It is shown that the\nqualitative characters of deformed shell structures are not very\nsensitive to the spin-orbit coupling[12]; however, it is reported\nthat the prolate-shape dominance in nuclear ground-state deformation is realized after strong correlation with surface diffuseness and spin-orbit coupling. In subsequent work, we will\nexpand the model Hamiltonian to incorporate the spin-orbit\npotential and discuss the nuclear problems which are closely\nrelated to spin degrees of freedom due to the strong spinorbit coupling. Some preliminary results have been reported\nin Ref. [18].\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe author thanks K. Matsuyanagi, M. Brack, A.G. Magner, Y.R. Shimizu, and N.

We have shown\nthat bridge orbits mediating equatorial and symmetry-axis\norbits play a significant role in normal and superdeformed\nshell structures. Particularly, prolate-oblate asymmetry of deformed shell structures, which is responsible for the prolate\ndominance in nuclear deformations, is clearly understood as\nthe asymmetric slopes of bridge orbits in the (\u03b4 , \u03c4 ) plane. This\nasymmetry grows with increasing radial parameter \u03b1 , and\nthus with increasing mass number A, which explains the fact\nthat the prolate dominance is more remarkable in heavier nuclei. Some of these bridge orbits coincide with triangular and\nrhomboidal orbits in the cavity limit \u03b1 = \u221e, whose significant\ncontribution to the coarse-grained level density in a spheroidal\ncavity and their roles in prolate-shape dominance were dis-\n\nFor a periodic orbit in a 2D autonomous Hamiltonian system, one can examine its bifurcation scenario by evaluating\nthe trace of (2 \u00d7 2) monodromy matrix as a function of control parameter such as deformation, strength of external field,\nor energy. 3D orbits in an axially symmetric potential have\na (2 \u00d7 2) symmetry-reduced monodromy matrix, but the ignored degree of freedom corresponding to symmetric rotation\nalso plays a role in bifurcation.\nFigure 23 shows a bifurcation diagram of periodic orbits responsible for superdeformed shell structures for \u03b1 = 5.0. The\norbit X undergoes a period-doubling bifurcation at \u03b4 = 0.42\nand generates a pair of bridges M(2, 1)u and M(2, 1)s , which\nsubmerge into the orbit Z at \u03b4 = 0.78 and 0.94, respectively.\nEquatorial circular orbit EC undergoes a period-doubling bifurcation at \u03b4 = 0.6 and generates 3D bridge B(2,2,1), which\nsubmerges into M(2, 1)s at \u03b4 = 0.77 before finally submerging into Z. Since EC is isolated, the monodromy matrix has\n\n\f19\n(a) 10\nM(2,1)u\n\n8\n\n~\nTrM\n\n6\n4\n\nZ\n\nB(2,2,1)\n\nE(5,2)\n\n2\n\n2X\n0\n\nM(2,1)s\n\n2EC(1)\n-2\n-4\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n\u03b4\n\n(b) 3\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n*\n2.1\n\n**\n2.00005\n\n2.0\n\n2.00000\n\n1.9\n\n1.99995\n\nB(5,2,1)u**\n2\n\n~\nTrM\n\nE(5,2)*\nB(5,2,1)s**\n1\n\nsize (4 \u00d7 4) and its four eigenvalues consists of two conjugate/reciprocal pairs. One pair are e\u00b1ivc , which represent stability against displacement in the equatorial plane, whose values are independent of deformation \u03b4 [2EC(1) in Fig. 23].\nThe other pair e\u00b1ivz , which represent stability against displacement toward the off-planar direction, change their values as a function of deformation [2EC(2) in Fig. 23(b)]. Bifurcation occurs when the latter eigenvalues become unity\n(vz = 0). The monodromy matrix of bridge B(2,2,1) has eigenvalues (eivc , e\u2212ivc , 1, 1) at its birth, and the first two eigenvalues change with increasing deformation. Therefore, the bifurcation point does not correspond to Tr M\u0303 = 2 for this bifurcation. The orbit B(2,2,1) submerge into M(2,1) at \u03b4 = 0.77.\nThis bifurcation point does not correspond to Tr M\u0303 = 2, either.\nHere, with decreasing \u03b4 , the mother orbit M(2, 1)s pushes out\na new orbit B(2,2,1) in the direction of the eigenvector of M\nbelonging to one of the unit eigenvalues (other than the one\nwhich corresponds to the rotation about the symmetry axis).\nIn general, the real symplectic matrix M can be transformed\ninto a Jordan canonical form by a suitable orthogonal transformation, and its (2 \u00d7 2) sub-block associated with the unit\neigenvalue generally has off-diagonal element v:\n\n2EC(2) *\nB(2,2,1)\n1.8\n\n0\n\n2EC(1)\n-1\n0.54\n\n1.7\n0.56\n\n0.58\n\n0.6\n\n0.62\n\n0.64\n\n0.66\n\n\u03b4\n\n\uf8eb\n\n1 v\n\uf8ec\nM\u223c\uf8ed 0 1\n\n\uf8f6\nM\u0303\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\nFIG. 23.

Panel (b) is the magnified plot of the rectangular region indicated in panel (a). For the orbit 2EC, traces of two (2 \u00d7 2) sub-blocks\nin a total (4\u00d74) monodromy matrix, denoted by 2EC(1) and 2EC(2),\nare plotted (see text).

This off-diagonal element varies as a function of\ndeformation, and vanishes at the bifurcation point, where M\nacquires a new eigenvector perpendicular to the former one.\nHere, the symmetry-reduced monodromy matrix M\u0303 generally\ndoes not have unit eigenvalues. This is what occurs in the case\nof a 3D orbit bifurcation in an axially symmetric potential,\nwhich is not detected from the trace of a symmetry-reduced\nmonodromy matrix.\n\n[1] M. C.
