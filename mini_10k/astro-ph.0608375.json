The collisions cause compression, cooling and turbulence\ngeneration in the gas, forming a cloud that then becomes self-gravitating and begins to collapse globally. Simultaneously, the turbulent, nonlinear density fluctuations induce fast, local collapse events.\nThe simulations show that: a) The clouds are not in a state of equilibrium. Instead, they undergo\nsecular evolution. During the early stages of the evolution, their mass and gravitational energy Eg\nincrease steadily, while the turbulent energy Ek reaches a plateau. b) When Eg becomes comparable to Ek , global collapse begins, causing a simultaneous increase in |Eg | and Ek that maintains a\nnear-equipartition condition |Eg | \u223c 2Ek . c) Longer inflow durations delay the onset of global and\nlocal collapse, by maintaining a higher turbulent velocity dispersion in the cloud over longer times.\nd) The star formation rate is large from the beginning, without any period of slow and accelerating\nstar formation. e) The column densities of the local star-forming clumps are very similar to reported\nvalues of the column density required for molecule formation, suggesting that locally molecular gas\nand star formation occur nearly simultaneously.

INTRODUCTION\n\nHeidelberg, Germany\n\n\f2\n\nV\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al.\n\nulations of colliding flows. The pioneering work of\nHunter et al. (1986) considered the collision of supersonic streams within MCs, finding that the fragments produced by the dynamical instability (which they\ntermed \"Rayleigh-Taylor-like\") were able to accrete mass\nuntil they became gravitationally unstable and collapse.\nHowever, this study was designed to investigate flows\nwithin MCs rather than the formation of the clouds\nthemselves, and so it considered much smaller (subparsec) scales and different density, temperature and\ncooling regimes than are relevant for the process of MC\nformation.\nMore recent numerical studies of MC formation\nnot including self-gravity (Koyama & Inutsuka 2002;\nHeitsch et al. 2005) have estimated that the individual\nclumps formed in the compressed layer formed by the\ncolliding streams are themselves gravitationally stable,\nalthough the entire compressed-gas complex would be\ngravitationally unstable, had self-gravity been included.\nThis raises the issue of whether the clumps can be\nconsidered in isolation. The question of which gas\nparcels are involved in the collapse of a particular\nobject is a delicate one, and lies, for example, at the\nheart of the debate of whether competitive accretion\nis relevant or not in the process of star formation\nwithin molecular clouds: A model in which clumps are\nisolated dense objects immersed in a more tenuous,\nunbound medium leads to the conclusion that competitive accretion is irrelevant (Krumholz, McKee & Klein\n2005). Instead, competitive accretion plays a central\nrole (Bonnell et al. 1997; Klessen, Bate & Burkert\n1998; Bonnell et al. 2001; Klessen & Burkert 2000,\n2001; Klessen 2001a,b; Bonnell & Bate 2006) in\na scenario in which the local density peaks are\nthe \"tips of the iceberg\" of the density distribution, the flows are organized on much larger scales\n(Ballesteros-Paredes, V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni & Scalo 1999;\nBallesteros-Paredes, Hartmann & V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni\n1999; Bate, Bonnell & Bromm 2003), and the evolution\nand energetics of the density peaks cannot be considered\nin isolation, but as part of the global flow instead\n(Ballesteros-Paredes, V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni & Scalo\n1999;\nKlessen, Heitsch & Mac Low\n2000;\nHeitsch, Mac Low & Klessen\n2001;\nShadmehri, V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni & Ballesteros-Paredes\n2002; Tilley & Pudritz 2004, 2005; Ballesteros-Paredes\n2006; Dib et al 2006). In a similar fashion, then,\naccurate determination of whether gravitational collapse\ncan be triggered by moderate-Mach number stream\ncollisions in the WNM, requires to self-consistently\ninclude self-gravity in the numerical simulations.\nSimulations of molecular cloud formation by\nthe passage of a self-gravitating, clumpy medium\nthrough Galactic spiral shocks (Bonnell et al. 2006;\nDobbs, Bonnell & Pringle 2006) have shown that realistic velocity dispersions and densities can be generated in\nthe resulting post-shock clouds, which are furthermore\ndriven to produce local collapse events leading to star\nformation, although a large fraction of the mass in\nthe clouds remains gravitationally unbound. However,\nbecause these simulations were isothermal, the gas\nhad to be assumed to already be clumpy and at very\nlow temperatures (\u223c 100 K) previous to the passage\nthrough the shock, while recent studies including\n\ncooling leading to thermal bistability of the atomic\ngas (Koyama & Inutsuka 2002; Audit & Hennebelle\n2005; Heitsch et al. 2005, 2006, Paper I) suggest that\nthe clumpiness is generated by the shock compression,\nwhich nonlinearly triggers the thermal instability,\ninduces supersonic turbulence, and causes the formation\nof dense clumps in the compressed layers.\nIt is thus essential to model the evolution of the cloud\nwithin the frame of its more diffuse environment including both self-gravity and cooling. Not only this is indispensible in order to model the generation of turbulence\nand clumpiness, but also to model the cloud's evolution\nas it exchanges mass and energy with its surroundings.\nNote that the generation of turbulence by the compression itself implies that the turbulence within the cloud\nis driven while the large-scale converging motions persist, and decaying afterwards. This is a mixed regime\nthat also requires self-consistent modeling of the cloud\nand its surroundings, rather than, for example, random\nFourier driving in closed boxes.\nFinally, such a unified (or \"holistic\") description of\nmolecular cloud formation and evolution, as outlined\nby V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni, Ballesteros-Paredes & Klessen\n(2003), including the star formation epoch, allows\nalso the investigation of a number of key problems,\nsuch as the evolutionary and star-formation timescales,\nthe evolution of the cloud's gravitational and kinetic\nenergies, and whether it settles into virial equilibrium or\nnot, and the effect of self-gravity on the cloud's physical\nconditions.\nIn this paper we investigate numerically the evolution\nof interstellar gas as it collects from the WNM, shocks,\nsuffers a phase transition to a cold and dense state, and\nfinally begins to form stars, by means of numerical simulations of colliding gas streams in the WNM, in the presence of self-gravity and cooling leading to thermal instability. Since this is a problem that naturally collects large\namounts of gas in small volumes, first by compressiontriggered thermal instability and then by gravitational\ninstability, it is convenient to use some Lagrangian numerical scheme, and we opt for a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code, sacrificing the possibility of including\nmagnetic fields. We also omit for now a self-consistent\ndescription of the stellar feedback on the gas and of the\nchemistry. Thus, our simulations will not adequately describe the latest stages of MC evolution (in which stellar\nenergy feedback may significantly influence the dynamics of the cloud) nor are they capable of predicting the\ntransition from atomic to molecular gas accurately. We\ndefer these tasks to subsequent papers.\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. In \u00a72 we first give a\nqualitative description of the physical system, the main\nphenomena involved, and our expectations for the evolution. In \u00a73 we describe the numerical code, the physical\nphysical setting, and the choice of parameters. Then, in\n4 we describe the results concerning the evolution of the\ncloud's mass and its kinetic and gravitational energies,\nand the onset of star formation. In \u00a75 we discuss the\nimplications and limitations of the recent work. Finally,\nin \u00a76 we present a summary and draw some conclusions.\n2. QUALITATIVE DISCUSSION\n\nIt is convenient to first present an overview of the system, its expected evolution, and the physical processes\n\n\fMolecular Cloud Evolution II\non which it relies (see also the description in Paper I).\nSince we are interested in studying the formation of a\ndense cloud out of the diffuse medium, we take as initial\ncondition a uniform-density region within the WNM, of a\nfew hundred parsecs across, with an initially compressive\nvelocity field consisting of two oppositely-directed inflows\nwith speed vinf and Mach number Minf , with respect to\nthe WNM temperature. This compressive field is generically representative of either the general turbulence in\nthe WNM, or of motions triggered by some large scale\nagent, such as gravitational or Parker instabilities, or\nshell collisions. Since the velocity dispersion in the WNM\nis transonic (Kulkarni & Heiles 1987; Heiles & Troland\n2003), we consider values of Minf \u223c 1.\nAs is well known, the atomic ISM is thermally\nbistable, with two stable phases being able to coexist at the same pressure but different densities and\ntemperatures, mediated by a thermally unstable range\n(Field 1965; Field, Goldsmith & Habing 1969).\nThe\ncollision of transonic WNM streams produces a thick\nshock-bounded slab, in which the gas is out of thermal equilibrium between radiative heating and cooling. This shocked slab is nonlinearly thermally unstable (Koyama & Inutsuka 2000; Kritsuk & Norman\n2002), and as it flows towards the collision plane,\nit undergoes a phase transition to the cold neutral medium (CNM), causing the formation of a\nthin cold layer, (Hennebelle & P\u00e9rault 1999, 2000;\nKoyama & Inutsuka 2000, 2002; Inutsuka & Koyama\n2004; Audit & Hennebelle 2005; Heitsch et al. 2005,\n2006, Paper I). Subsequently, the boundary of this\nlayer is destabilized, probably by a combination of\nthermal instability and nonlinear thin-shell instability\n(Vishniac 1994), producing fully-developed turbulence\nin the layer for sufficiently large Minf (Hunter et al.\n1986; Koyama & Inutsuka 2002; Inutsuka & Koyama\n2004; Heitsch et al. 2005, 2006, Paper I). As the layer\nbecomes turbulent, it thickens, and becomes a fully\nthree-dimensional structure (Paper I), to which we simply refer as \"the cloud\".\nMoreover, the thermal pressure in the dense cloud is in\npressure balance with the total (thermal + ram) pressure\nin the inflows, which is significantly larger than the mean\nthermal pressure in the ISM (Paper I). Consequently, the\ndensity in the cold layer can reach densities significantly\nlarger than those typical of the CNM. Thus, this cloud\nis turbulent, dense, and overpressured with respect to\nthe mean ISM pressure; i.e., it has properties typical of\nmolecular clouds (Paper I). The main missing link in this\nscenario is whether the atomic gas can be readily converted to molecular, although several studies suggest it is\nfeasible (Bergin et al. 2004; Glover & Mac Low 2006).\nSince we do not incorporate any chemistry nor radiative\ntransfer in our code, we cannot follow this transition selfconsistently, and simply assume that once the dense gas\nhas a sufficiently large column density (see below), it is\nrapidly converted to the molecular phase.\nIn summary, the compression produces a turbulent\ncloud of dense and cold gas. As it becomes denser and\ncolder, its Jeans mass decreases substantially. Moreover,\nits own mass is increasing, so it rapidly becomes much\nmore massive than its own Jeans mass. Also, as the cloud\nbecomes more massive, its total gravitational energy (in\nabsolute value) |Eg | increases substantially, and eventu-\n\n3\n\nally overcomes even its turbulent kinetic energy, and the\ncloud begins collapsing as a whole. Because it contains\nmany Jeans masses, local collapse events begin to occur\nat the nonlinear density peaks produced by the turbulence, if gravity locally overcomes all available forms of\nsupport. Because the density enhancements are nonlinear, the local collapse events occur on shorter timescales\nthan the global contraction.\nThe magnetic field should also be considered.\nHennebelle & P\u00e9rault (2000) have shown that the transition from diffuse to dense gas can occur even in\nthe presence of magnetic fields aligned with or oblique\nto the direction of compression. Moreover, most evidence, both theoretical and observational, points towards\nMCs and giant molecular complexes being magnetically\nsupercritical or marginally critical at least (Crutcher\n1999; Hartmann, Ballesteros-Paredes & Bergin 2001;\nBourke et al. 2001; Crutcher, Heiles & Troland 2003).\nSince the magnetically supercritical case is not qualitatively different from the non-magnetic case, the above\ndiscussion is applicable to supercritical clouds as well.\nHartmann, Ballesteros-Paredes & Bergin (2001) have\napproximately quantified the above scenario, estimating\nthat the accumulation time from the WNM should be of\nthe order of 10\u201320 Myr, the accumulated gas must come\nfrom distances up to a few hundred parsecs, and that at\nthe end of the accumulation period, the gas should be\nbecoming molecular and self-gravitating at roughly the\nsame time, because the column density for self-shielding\nand formation of molecular gas,\nNss \u223c 1 \u2212 2 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 ,\n\n(1)\n\nis very similar to that required for rendering the dense\ngas gravitationally unstable,\n1/2\n\nNgi \u223c 1.5 \u00d7 1021 P4\n\ncm\u22122 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere P4 is the pressure expressed in units of 104\nK cm\u22123 (see also Franco & Cox 1986).\nThat\nis, the gas is converted to the molecular phase\nroughly simultaneously with the onset of gravitational instability, explaining why non-star-forming\nMCs are rare, at least in the solar neighborhood\n(Hartmann, Ballesteros-Paredes & Bergin\n2001;\nHartmann\n2003; Ballesteros-Paredes & Hartmann\n2006). Note, however, that this near equality is a\ncoincidence (e.g., Elmegreen 1985, 1993a), since Ngi\ndepends on the ambient pressure, and therefore nonstar-forming molecular clouds may be more common\nin higher-pressure environments, possibly explaining\nobservations that up to 30% of the GMCs appear\nto be starless in some external galaxies (Blitz et al.\n2006). On the other hand, this result may be due in\npart to incompleteness effects. Indeed, recent Spitzer\nobservations have uncovered young stellar objects in\nGalactic molecular cores previously believed to be\nstarless (e.g., Craspi et al. 2005; Rho et al. 2006).\nIn the remainder of the paper, we proceed to quantify\nthis scenario by means of numerical simulations designed\nfor this purpose.\n3. THE MODEL\n3.1. Parameters and numerical scheme\n\n\f4\n\nV\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al.\n\nWe consider a cubic box of length Lbox on a side, initially filled with WNM at a uniform density of n0 =\n1 cm\u22123 , with a mean molecular weight of 1.27, so that\nthe mean mass density is \u03c10 = 2.12\u00d710\u221224 g cm\u22123 , which\nimplies total masses of 6.58 \u00d7 104 M\u2299 and 5.26 \u00d7 105 M\u2299\nfor the two box sizes used, Lbox = 128 pc and 256 pc,\nrespectively.\nThe gas has a temperature T0 = 5000\nK, the thermal-equilibrium temperature at that density\n(cf. \u00a73.3). Within the box, we set up two cylindrical\nand oppositely-directed inflows, each of length linf , radius rinf = 32 pc, and speed vinf = \u00b19.20 km s\u22121 ,\ncorresponding to a Mach number Minf = 1.22 with\nrespect to the sound speed of the undisturbed WNM,\ncWNM = 7.536 km s\u22121 (see fig. 1). For the two values of\nlinf we consider here (48 pc and 112 pc), the masses of the\ncylindrical inflows are 1.13 \u00d7 104 M\u2299 and 2.64 \u00d7 104 M\u2299 ,\nrespectively. To trigger the dynamical instability of the\ncompressed slab, a fluctuating velocity field (computed\nin Fourier space) is initially imposed throughout the box\nat wavenumbers 4 \u2264 kLbox \u2264 8, and having amplitude\nvrms,i . The streams are directed along the x direction\nand collide at half the x extension of the box. Table 1\ngives the values of these parameters for the simulations\npresented here. The runs are named mnemonically as\nLxxx\u2206v0.yy, where xxx indicates the physical box size in\nparsecs and 0.yy indicates the value of vrms,i in km s\u22121 .\nWe use the N-body+smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code GADGET (Springel, Yoshida & White\n2001), as modified by Jappsen et al. (2005) to include\nsink particles, a prescription to describe collapsed objects without following their internal structure. We use\n1.64 \u00d7 106 particles for the runs with Lbox = 128 pc, and\n3.24\u00d7106 particles for the run with Lbox = 256 pc. Since\nthe larger-box run contains 8 times more mass than the\nsmaller-box ones but uses only twice as many particles,\nthe minimum resolved mass in the larger-box run is four\ntimes larger than in the smaller-box run. Unfortunately,\nthe computing resources available in our cluster did not\nallow us to further increase the number of particles.\nWe take as units for the code a mass of 1M\u2299 , a length\nl0 = 1 pc and a velocity v0 = 7.362 km s\u22121 , implying a\ntime unit t0 = l0 /v0 = 0.133 Myr.\n3.2. Sink particles\n\nSink particles are created when a group of SPH particles become involved in a local collapse event. At that\npoint, the SPH particles are replaced by a sink particle\nwhose internal structure is not resolved anymore. The\nsink particle inherits the total angular momentum and\nmass of the SPH particles it replaces, and henceforth\nmoves only in response to its inertia and the gravitational\nforce, although it can continue to accrete SPH particles,\nshould they come sufficiently close to the sink particle.\nThe creation of a sink particle requires a number of\nconditions to be satisfied. First, the local density should\nexceed some user-defined threshold value nthr . If this occurs, then the code computes the total mass and angular\nmomentum of the group of particles above nthr to determine whether they are gravitationally bound. If they are,\nthen they are collectively replaced by the sink. At subsequent times, further SPH particles can be accreted by\nthe sink if they come within an \"accretion radius\" racc of\nthe sink and are gravitationally bound to it. In all cases\n\nwe use nthr = 105 cm\u22123 and racc = 0.04 pc. This value\nof racc amounts to roughly 1/3 of the Jeans length at\nnthr . Due to the limited mass resolution we can afford,\nthe sinks should in general be considered star clusters\nrather than isolated stars, although some of them may\nactually correspond to single stars. Nevertheless, with\nthis caveat in mind, we refer to the sinks as \"stars\" in a\ngeneric way.\n3.3. Heating and cooling\nThe gas is subject to heating and cooling functions of\nthe form\n\n\u0393 = 2.0 \u00d7 10\u221226 erg s\u22121\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u039b(T )\n\u22121.184 \u00d7 105\n= 107 exp\n\u0393\nT + 1000\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u221a\n\u221292\ncm3 .\n+ 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22122 T exp\nT\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nThese functions are fits to the various heating (\u0393) and\ncooling (\u039b) processes considered by Koyama & Inutsuka\n(2000), as given by equation (4) of Koyama & Inutsuka\n(2002).5 The resulting thermal-equilibrium pressure\nPeq , defined by the condition n2 \u039b = n\u0393 is shown in fig. 2\nas a function of density. We have abandoned the piecewise power-law fit we have used in all of our previous\npapers (e.g., V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni, Passot & Pouquet\n1995;\nPassot, V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni & Pouquet\n1995; V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni, Passot & Pouquet\n1996;\nV\u00e1zquez-Semadeni, Gazol & Scalo 2000; Gazol et al.\n2001; Gazol, V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni & Kim 2005), including Paper I, mainly because the present fit is applicable\nat densities typical of molecular gas.\nThe usual procedure to apply cooling to the hydrodynamic evolution involves the consideration of the cooling\nrate in the Courant condition to restrict the simulation\ntime step. For the problem at hand, the high densities reached behind the shocks, for example, would imply an exceedingly small time step and the simulation\nwould become computationally unfeasible. But this appears completely unnecessary, because all this means is\nthat the thermal evolution happens faster than the dynamical one, and therefore, as far as the hydrodynamics\nis concerned, it is instantaneous. Therefore, it is more\nconvenient to use an approximation to the thermal evolution of the gas, which constitutes an extension of that\nused in Paper I, and which allows us to simply correct\nthe internal energy after the hydrodynamic step has been\nperformed, with no need to adjust the timestep.\nConsider the thermal equilibrium temperature, Teq , as\na function of the gas density, and the corresponding internal energy density eeq (Teq is a well defined function\nof the density n as long as \u039b(T ) is monotonic. This is\ntrue within the range of temperatures occurring in the\nsimulations). Consider also the time required to radiate\nthe thermal energy excess (if T > Teq ; acquire the energy\ndeficit, if T < Teq )\n5 Note that eq. (4) in Koyama & Inutsuka (2002) contains two\ntypographical errors. The form used here incorporates the necesary\ncorrections, kindly provided by H. Koyama.\n\n\fMolecular Cloud Evolution II\ne \u2212 eeq\n\u03c4\u039b = 2\n.\nn \u039b \u2212 n\u0393\n\n(5)\n\ne\u2032 = eeq + (e \u2212 eeq ) exp(\u2212dt/\u03c4\u039b ).\n\n(6)\n\ne\u2032 = e \u2212 dt(n2 \u039b \u2212 n\u0393),\n\n(7)\n\nThen, we compute the new internal energy density e\u2032 ,\nafter a time step dt, as\n\nNote that, if the gas is cooling down (or heating up)\nrapidly, \u03c4\u039b \u226a dt, exp(\u2212dt/\u03c4\u039b ) \u2192 0 and the gas immediately reaches its equilibrium temperature, without ever\novershooting beyond that value. Conversely, if the gas is\nat very low density or is close to the equilibrium temperature, \u03c4\u039b \u226b dt, and equation (6) becomes,\nwhere we, again, use the fact that \u039b(T ), as given by\nequation (4), is a monotonic function of the temperature.\n3.4. Gravitational instability in cooling media\n\nThe standard Jeans instability analysis is modified in\na medium in which the balance between heating and\ninstantaneous cooling produces a net polytropic behavior, characterized by an effective polytropic exponent \u03b3e ,\nwhich is the slope of the thermal-equilibrium pressure\nversus density curve (fig. 2). In this case, the Jeans\nlength is found to be given by (e.g., Elmegreen 1991;\nV\u00e1zquez-Semadeni, Passot & Pouquet 1996)\n\u0015\u22121/2\n\u0014\n\u03b3e \u03c0c2\n,\n(8)\nLJ \u2261\n\u03b3G\u03c10\nwhere c is the adiabatic sound speed and \u03b3 is the heat\ncapacity ratio of the gas. Equivalently, this instability\ncriterion can be described as if the effective\nsound speed\np\nin the system were given by ceff = \u03b3e kT /\u03bc, where k\nis Boltzmann's constant and \u03bc is the mean molecular\nweight. Note that, when \u03b3e = 0, the thermal pressure\ndoes not react to density changes and therefore is unable\nto oppose the collapse, rendering the medium gravitationally unstable at all scales (LJ = 0). In a more realistic situation where the cooling is not instantaneous, the\nJeans length will be limited by the cooling length. In this\nwork, the cooling has a finite characteristic timescale,\ngiven by eq. (5).\nAt the initial uniform density n0 = 1 cm\u22123 and temperature T0 = 5000 K, \u03b3e \u223c 0 and the Jeans length is also\nnear zero. This can be seen in fig. 2, where the vertical\ndotted line shows the initial uniform density, at which\nthe local tangent to the Peq vs. \u03c1 curve is seen to have a\nnearly zero slope. However, when the compression produces a dense cloud at the midplane of the box, the rest\nof the gas decreases its density and enters the fully stable\nwarm phase. For reference, at a density n = 0.5 cm\u22123\nand a corresponding equilibrium temperature Teq = 6300\nK, \u03b3e = 0.834 and LJ = 1324 pc, implying a Jeans mass\nMJ = 3.47 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 . Under these conditions, our runs\nwith Lbox = 128 and Lbox = 256 pc would initially contain \u223c 10\u22123 and \u223c 10\u22122 Jeans masses, respectively.\n4. RESULTS\n4.1. Mass evolution\n\n5\n\nIn general, the simulations evolve as described in Paper I and in sec. \u00a72. As an illustration, figs. 3 and 4\nshow selected snapshots of run L256\u2206v0.17 viewed edgeon and face-on, respectively. In the electronic version of\nthe paper, these figures are also available as full-length\nanimations. The times indicated in the frames are in the\ncode's internal unit, t0 = 0.133 Myr.\nThe animation shows that the gas at the collision site\nbegins to undergo a phase transition to the cold phase\n(the CNM) at roughly one cooling time after the collision\n(Hennebelle & P\u00e9rault 1999; V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al.\n2006), becoming much denser and colder. Because this\ngas is in equilibrium with the total (thermal+ram) pressure of the inflow, the density overshoots far beyond that\nof standard CNM, well into the realm of molecular gas,\nwith mean densities of several hundred cm\u22123 and temperatures of a few tens of Kelvins. This implies a much\nlower Jeans mass than that in the conditions of the initial WNM and quickly the cloud's mass exceeds its Jeans\nmass.\nDefining the \"cloud\" as the material with n >\n50 cm\u22123 , the cloud's mass becomes larger than its mean\nJeans mass at t \u223c 2.2 Myr in runs with Lbox = 128\npc and at t \u223c 3 Myr in the run with Lbox = 256 pc,\nat which times the mean density in the dense gas is\nhni \u223c 65 cm\u22123 , the mean temperature is hT i \u223c 50 K,\nthe Jeans mass is MJ \u223c 1200 M\u2299 , and the free-fall time\nis \u03c4ff \u2261 LJ /c \u223c 11 Myr, where c is the local sound speed.\nFor comparison, the total mass in the two cylinders,\nwhich contain the material that initially builds up the\ncloud, is 1.13 \u00d7 104 M\u2299 in the runs with Lbox = 128 pc,\nand 2.26 \u00d7 104 M\u2299 in the run with Lbox = 256 pc. Thus,\nthe cloud eventually becomes much more massive than\nits mean Jeans mass. For example, in run L256\u2206v0.17\nat t = 17.26 Myr, the (mass-weighted) mean density of\nthe dense gas is hni \u223c 600 cm\u22123 , the mean temperature\nis hT i \u223c 37 K, and \u03b3e \u223c 0.75. These values imply a\nmean effective Jeans mass MJ \u223c 300 M\u2299 , while at that\ntime the cloud contains \u223c 2.35 \u00d7 104 M\u2299 . Note that\nthe cloud+sink mass might exceed the mass in the inflows, since ambient material surrounding the cylinder\nis dragged along with the flow, effectively increasing the\namount of gas in the inflow (see below).\nThe animations show that global collapse does indeed\noccur, although at significantly later times than when\nthe cloud's mass becomes larger than the Jeans mass,\nprobably reflecting the role of turbulence as an opposing\nagent to the collapse. Indeed, the clouds in the 128-pc\nboxes begin global contraction at t \u223c 8 Myr, while the\ncloud in the 256-pc box, with more than twice the inflow\nduration, begins contracting at t \u223c 12.5 Myr.\nFigure 5 (top panel) shows the evolution of the cloud's\nmass in run L256\u2206v0.17, together with the mass in collapsed objects (sinks), to be discussed further in \u00a74.5.\nIt is clearly seen that the cloud's mass is not constant,\nbut rather evolves in time. Gas at cloud densities first\nappears after 2 Myr of evolution, and the cloud's mass\nincreases monotonically until t \u223c 19.5 Myr, at which\ntime it reaches a maximum value Mcl \u223c 2.7 \u00d7 104 M\u2299 .\nAfter this time, it begins to decrease because of the rapid\nconversion of gas to stars.\nBy the end of the simulation, the total mass in stars\nplus dense gas is almost three times the initial mass in\n\n\f6\n\nV\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al.\n\nthe inflows. In practice, the inflows last longer than the\nsimple estimate \u03c4inf \u2261 linf /vinf would indicate, and involve more mass than the mass initially within the cylinders. This is due to the fact that, as the cylinders begin advancing, they leave large voids behind them that\nhave the double effect of slowing down the tails of the\ninflows and of dragging the surrounding gas behind the\ncylinders. For vinf = 9.20 km s\u22121 , \u03c4inf = 5.22 Myr for\nruns with linf = 48 pc (L128\u2206v0.24 and L128\u2206v0.66),\nand \u03c4inf = 12.17 Myr for the run with linf = 112 pc\n(L256\u2206v0.17). Instead, in the first two runs, the inflow\nactually lasts \u223c 11 Myr, while in the latter run it lasts\n\u223c 22.5 Myr. This can be observed in the animation of\nfig. 3, in which the velocity field arrows clearly show the\ngradual decay of the inflows, and their longer duration\ncompared to the simple linear estimate.\n4.2. Cloud disruption\nOur simulations do not include any feedback\nfrom the stellar objects, while this process is probably essential for the energy balance and possibly the destruction of the cloud (e.g.,\nCox\n1983, 1985; Franco, Shore & Tenorio-Tagle\n1994;\nHartmann, Ballesteros-Paredes & Bergin\n2001;\nMatzner 2002; Nakamura & Li 2005; Li & Nakamura\n2006; Mellema et al. 2006). Thus, the simulations\ncannot be safely considered realistic after their stellar\ncontent would likely disrupt the cloud. We now present\nan a posteriori estimation of the time at which this\noccurs.\nFranco, Shore & Tenorio-Tagle (1994) have suggested\nthat the maximum number of OB stars that the cloud can\nsupport at any time is given by the number of H II regions\nrequired to completely ionize the cloud. In particular,\nthey found that the maximum number of massive stars\nthat can be formed within a molecular cloud is\n3/7\n\nNOB,inside \u2243\n\n16Mc,4 n3\n5/7\n\nF48 (cs,15 tMS,7 )6/7\n\n,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere Mc,4 is the mass of the cloud, in units of 104\nM\u2299 , n3 is the number density in units of 103 cm\u22123 ,\nF48 is the photoionizing flux from the massive stars, in\nunits of 1048 s\u22121 , cs,15 is the isothermal sound speed\nin units of 15 km s\u22121 , and tMS,7 is a characteristic OB\nstar main sequence lifetime, in units of 107 yr. However, as Franco, Shore & Tenorio-Tagle (1994) pointed\nout, clouds are more efficiently destroyed by stars at\nthe cloud edge because the lower external pressure ensures that the ionized gas expands rapidly away from\nthe cloud, driving a fast ionization front into the dense\nmaterial. Thus, in this case, these authors find that the\nmaximum number of OB stars that the molecular cloud\ncan support is given by:\n1/5\n\nNOB,edge \u2243\n\n3Mc,4 n3\n3/5\n\nF48 (cs,15 tMS,7 )6/5\n\n.\n\n(10)\n\nIn order to determine the time at which the MC in\nour simulation has formed a sufficient number of stars to\ndisrupt it, we proceed as follows. Since the individual\nsink particles in the simulations in general correspond to\n\nclusters rather than to single stars, we cannot use the\nsink particle masses directly. Instead, for each temporal\noutput of our simualtion, we fit a standard initial mass\nfunction (Kroupa 2001) to the total mass in sink particles at that time, to obtain the the \"real\" distribution\nof stellar masses in the simulation at that time.6 We\nthen use Table 1 of D\u0131\u0301az-Miller, Franco & Shore (1998),\nwhich gives the ionizing flux as a function of stellar mass,\nto estimate the flux associated to each mass bin, and then\nintegrate over all relevant masses to obtain the total F48 .\nNow, from eqs. (9) or (10) one can solve for Mc,4 as a\nfunction of NOB , to find the minimum cloud mass that\nsurvives the ionizing radiation from the existing OB stars\nin the simulation. When this minimum surviving mass\nis larger than the actual cloud mass, we expect that the\ncloud will be disrupted. Since we define the \"cloud\" as\nthe gas with densities above 50 cm\u22123 , we take n3 = 0.05.\nAlso, for simplicity we assume cs,15 tMS,7 \u223c 1.\nFor run L256\u2206v0.17, fig. 6 shows the evolution of the\ncloud's mass together with the minimum disrupted cloud\nmass under the two estimates, eqs. (9) and (10). We see\nthat the cloud is expected to be disrupted at t = 20.3\nwith either estimate.\nAt this time the mass in sinks is Msinks = 5.25\u00d7103M\u2299\nand the cloud's mass is Mcl = 2.67 \u00d7 104 M\u2299 , so that the\nstar formation efficiency (SFE) up to this time has been\nSFE =\n\nM\u2217\n\u2248 16%.\nMcl + M\u2217\n\n(11)\n\nThis number is still larger than observational estimates\nfor cloud complexes (Myers et al. 1986), and suggests\nthat additional physical processes, such as longer inflow\ndurations (\u00a74.6) or magnetic fields (\u00a75.2) may be necessary to further reduce the SFE.\nWe conclude from this section that after t \u2248 20.3 Myr\nrun L256\u2206v0.17 is probably not realistic anymore, as far\nas the evolution of a real MC is concerned, and we thus\nrestrict most of our subsequent discussions to times earlier than that, except when later times may be illustrative\nof some physical process. Self-consistent inclusion of stellar feedback in the simulations, similarly to the studies\nof Nakamura & Li (2005) and Li & Nakamura (2006),\nto investigate the final stages of MC evolution will be the\nsubject of future work.\n4.3. Turbulence evolution\n\nThe collision also generates turbulence in the dense\ngas, and so the cloud can be considered to be in a driven\nturbulent regime while the inflows persist, and in a decaying regime after the inflows subside, although the transition from driven to decaying is smooth, rather than\nabrupt, since the inflows subside gradually, as explained\nabove. Figure 5 (bottom panel) shows the evolution of\nthe velocity dispersion \u03c3 for the dense gas along each of\nthe three coordinate axes for run L256\u2206v0.17. During\nthe first 10 Myr of the cloud's existence (2 . t . 12 Myr)\n\u03c3y \u2248 \u03c3z \u223c 4 km s\u22121 , although it is interesting to note\nthat the turbulence appears to be anisotropic, with \u03c3x\n6 Note that this estimate for the number of massive stars as a\nfunction of time is probably a lower limit, as recent simulations\nsuggest that massive stars in clusters tend to form first, while stars\nformed later tend to be less massive because of the competition for\naccretion with the existing massive stars (e.g. Bonnell 2005).\n\n\fMolecular Cloud Evolution II\nfirst increasing and then decreasing. It reaches a maximum of more than twice as large (\u223c 8.5 km s\u22121 ) as that\nof \u03c3y and \u03c3z at t \u2248 6 Myr, reflecting the fact that the\ninflows are directed along this direction. This suggests\nthat the generation of transverse turbulent motions is not\n100% efficient. Of course, this effect is probably exaggerated by our choice of perfectly anti-parallel colliding\nstreams. Clouds formed by obliquely colliding streams\nare likely to have more isotropic levels of turbulence.\nAfter t \u223c 6 Myr, \u03c3x begins to decrease, reflecting\nthe weakening of the inflows, settling at \u03c3x \u223c 6 km s\u22121\nby t \u223c 12 Myr. At this time, \u03c3y and \u03c3z begin to increase, reflecting the global collapse of the cloud on the\nyz plane, while \u03c3x remains nearly stationary, unaffected\nby the global planar collapse, until t \u223c 18 Myr, at which\ntime it also begins to increase. This coincides with the\nonset of star formation, and probably reflects the local,\nsmall-scale, isotropic collapse events forming individual\ncollapsed objects.\n4.4. Evolution of the density, pressure and temperature\n\ndistributions\nAn important consideration for understanding the production of local collapse events is the distribution of the\ndensity and temperature as the cloud evolves. This is\nshown in fig. 7, where the normalized mass-weighted histograms of density (left panel) and of temperature (right\npanel) are shown at times 4, 8, 12, 14, 16, and 20 Myr\nfor run L256\u2206v0.17. It can be seen that a cold phase\nalready exists at t = 4 Myr, although at this time the\ncloud's conditions do not greatly exceed those of the standard CNM, meaning that turbulence is only building up\nin the cloud at this stage, at which the simulation resembles a two-phase medium. At t = 8 Myr, the density\nmaxima and temperature minima have shifted to more\nextreme values, which persist up to t = 12 Myr, indicating that the density and temperature fluctuations are\npredominantly created by the supersonic turbulence in\nthe cloud (V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al. 2006). However, by\nt = 14 Myr, the density and temperature extrema are\nseen to be again moving towards more extreme values,\nand this trend persists throughout the rest of the simulation, indicating that gravitational collapse has taken\nover the evolution of the density fluctuations (see also\n\u00a74.5).\nIt thus appears that in this particular simulation, the\nturbulent density fluctuations act as simply as seeds\nfor the subsequent growth of the fluctuations by gravitational instability, as proposed by Clark & Bonnell\n(2005). However, both in that paper as in the present\nstudy, the global turbulence is already decaying, and by\ndefinition it cannot then continue competing with selfgravity. Minimally, a fundamental role of turbulence,\neven in this decaying state, must be to create nonlinear density fluctuations, of much larger amplitudes than\nwould be created by thermal instability alone, which can\ncollapse in shorter times than the whole cloud (cf. \u00a7\u00a74.5\nand 5.1). In any case, simulations in which the inflow\nlasts beyond the onset of collapse would be desirable, but\nunfortunately, as mentioned in \u00a74.6, we have not found\nit feasible to attempt them with the present code and\ncomputational resources, and such a study must await a\ndifferent numerical scheme and physical setup.\n\n7\n\n4.5. Energy evolution and star formation\nFigure 8 (top panel) shows the evolution of the kinetic (Ek ) and thermal (Eth ) energies within a cylinder\nof length 16 pc and radius 32 pc centered at the middle\npoint of the numerical box, together with the evolution of\nthe (absolute value of the) gravitational energy (|Eg |) for\nthe entire simulation box. This cylinder contains most\nof the cloud's mass thoughout the simulation, although\nit also contains sizable amounts of interspersed WNM.\nFigure 8 (bottom panel), on the other hand, shows the\nevolution of the same energies but with Ek and Eth calculated for the dense gas only.\nThe gravitational energy is shown for the entire box\nbecause of the practical difficulty to evaluate it only for\nthe cloud's mass, although we expect the latter to dominate the global gravitational energy when the cloud has\nbecome very massive. Indeed, we observe that |Eg | at\nlate times is very large and dominates the other forms\nof energy. A brief period of positive values of |Eg | is observed for 0 . t . 9 Myr, which can be understood as\nfollows: Because the boundary conditions are periodic,\nPoisson's equation for the gravitational potential is actually modified to have the density fluctuation \u03c1 \u2212 h\u03c1i as\nits source. This is standard fare in cosmological simulations (see, e.g., Alecian & L\u00e9orat 1988; Kolb & Turner\n1990). Moreover, gravity is a long-range force, and so\nlarge-scale features tend to dominate Eg . Thus, during\nthe early epochs of the simulation, when the cloud is beginning to be assembled, the dominant density features\nare the voids left behind by the cylinders because they\nare large, while the cloud is small and not very massive.\nHowever, once the cloud becomes sufficiently massive,\nand the voids have been smoothed out, the cloud dominates Eg . The period of positive Eg is omitted from both\npanels of fig. 8.\nComparison of the energy plots (figs. 8 top and bottom) with the evolution of the gas and sink masses (fig.\n5 top) and the animations shows some very important\npoints. First and foremost, the cloud is never in virial\nequilibrium over its entire evolution. Instead, we can\nidentify three main stages of evolution. First, over the\nperiod 8.5 . t . 14 Myr, |Eg | increases monotonically,\ntransiting from being negligible compared to Ek and Eth\nto becoming larger than either one of them. The exact\ntime at which this occurs depends on what system is being considered. It occurs at t \u223c 10 Myr when only the\nenergies in the dense gas are considered, while it occurs\nat t \u223c 18 Myr when the entire cylinder, which includes\nsubstantial amounts of warm gas, is considered. Since\nglobal gravitational contraction starts at t \u223c 12 Myr, it\nappears that the true balance is bracketed by the estimates based on the full cylinder volume and on the dense\ngas, though closer to the latter. Thus, over the interval\n8.5 . t . 12 Myr, the increase in |Eg | is driven mostly\nby the cooling and compression of the gas.\nSecond, from t \u223c 12 Myr to t \u223c 24 Myr, |Eg | continues\nto increase (Eg becomes more negative), but now driven\nby the global collapse of the cloud. Over this period, we\nsee that Ek for the dense gas (fig. 8, bottom panel) closely\nfollows |Eg |, approximately satisfying the condition\n\n|Eg | = 2Ek .\n\n(12)\n\nWe see that in this case, this condition is a signature of\n\n\f8\n\nV\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al.\n\ncollapse, not of gravitational equilibrium, even though it\nlasts for nearly 12 Myr. The maintenance of this equipartition arises from the fact that the cloud is converting\ngravitational potential energy into kinetic energy, but is\nreplenishing the former by the collapse itself.\nNote that we have cautioned in \u00a74.2 that our simulations may not be realistic after t \u2248 20.3 Myr, because\nby that time the stellar energy feedback may be sufficient to revert the global collapse and disperse the cloud,\nbut even in that case the cloud will have evolved out of\nequilibrium up to that point.\nFinally, after t \u223c 24 Myr, the gravitational and kinetic\nturbulent energies saturate and begin to vary in approximate synchronicity. Although this late stage may not\nbe representative of actual MCs, it is important to understand what is happening in the simulation. The near\nconstancy of |Eg | and Ek could naively be interpreted\nas a final state of near virial equilibrium. However, inspection of the animations shows otherwise. At t \u223c 24\nMyr, the main body of the cloud is completing its global\ncollapse, and the mass in stars is beginning to exceed the\nmass in dense gas, which is itself decreasing. So, at this\npoint, the gravitational energy is beginning to be dominated by the stars, rather than by the gas. Moreover, the\nface-on animation (fig. 4) shows that at this time (t = 180\nin code units, shown in the animations) the star cluster is\nbeginning to re-expand, after having reached maximum\ncompression. This leads to the decrease of |Eg | between\nt \u223c 24 and t \u223c 28 Myr. Meanwhile, Ek , which is dominated by the dense gas, decreases because the dense gas\nis being exhausted. Nevertheless, the outer \"chaff\" of\nthe dense gas, mostly in the form of radial filaments, is\ncontinuing to fall onto the collapsed cloud. This leads to\na new increase in both energies, as this is a secondary\ncollapse. This situation repeats itself at t \u223c 32 Myr\n(t = 244 in code units) after the secondary collapse ends\nand its second-generation star cluster begins to expand\naway. The end of each collapse and the re-expansion of\nthe clusters is marked by kinks in the graph of Msinks\nversus time in fig. 5 (top), indicating a decrease in the\nstar formation rate.\nIt is important to recall as well that the condition\ngiven by eq. (12) is not sufficient for virial equilibrium.\nThe necessary and sufficient condition for this is that\nthe second time derivative of the moment of inertia of\nthe cloud be zero, and eq. (12) cannot guarantee this,\nas many other terms enter the full virial balance of the\ncloud (Ballesteros-Paredes, V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni & Scalo\n1999; Ballesteros-Paredes 2006; Dib et al 2006). Thus,\nthe observed closeness of |Eg | and Ek in actual molecular clouds must exclusively be considered an indication\nof near equipartition and probably of collapse, but not\nof virial equilibrium (see also Klessen et al. 2005).\nThus, rather than evolving in near virial equilibrium,\nthe cloud evolves far from equilibrium. |Eg | starts out\nfrom essentially zero and increases monotonically until it\ncatches up with the thermal and kinetic energies. From\nthat time on, gravity dominates the energy balance, leading to collapse, which in turn causes a near equipartition\nbetween |Eg | and Ek , although both energies continue to\nvary systematically.\nFinally, figure 5 (top) also shows that star formation\nbegins at t \u223c 17.2 Myr, roughly 5 Myr after global contraction of the cloud has begun. Yet, the star-forming\n\nlocal collapse events proceed much more rapidly than\nthe global collapse of the cloud. This indicates that the\nturbulence in the cloud has created nonlinear density\nfluctuations, whose local free-fall time is shorter than\nthat of the whole cloud. In particular, the mass in stars\nincreases from zero to \u223c 15% of the cloud's mass in \u223c 3\nMyr (from t = 17 to t = 20 Myr).\nThe main conclusions from this section are that a) the\ncloud evolves far from equilibrium all the way from its\ninception through its final collapse; b) as soon as Eg\ndominates the dynamics, the cloud develops equipartition indicative of the collapse, not of equilibrium, and c)\nstar formation is rapid in comparison with the evolution\nand collapse of the whole cloud.\n4.6. Effect of the inflow duration and initial velocity\n\ndispersion\nIn previous papers (V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni, Kim & Ballesteros-Parede\n2005; V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al. 2006), it has been argued that the star formation efficiency is a sensitive\nfunction of whether the turbulence in the cloud is in a\ndriven or in a decaying regime. Our system is driven\nat first, and gradually transits to a decaying regime, as\npointed out in \u00a74.3. In all of the runs in this paper,\nglobal cloud contraction and the subsequent star formation occur after the inflows have weakened substantially\n(t > \u03c4inf ). The main motivation behind run L256\u2206v0.17\nwas precisely to model an inflow of as long a duration\nas possible, to approximate the case of a driven cloud,\nalthough this goal was not completely achieved. For example, Hartmann, Ballesteros-Paredes & Bergin (2001)\nsuggest accumulation lengths of up to 400 pc. Runs\nwith even larger boxes (e.g., 512 pc) would be desirable,\nbut they are either prohibitely expensive, or have an\nexcessively poor mass resolution. In addition, vertical\nstratification effects would have to be considered. This\nwill require a transition to the code Gadget2, which\nallows for non-cubic boundary conditions and/or inflow\nboundary conditions, a task we defer to a subsequent\npaper.\nNevertheless, comparison of the runs with different inflow lengths does shed light on the effect of a longer driving duration. The cloud in run L256\u2206v0.17, whose inflow\nhas linf = 112 pc and lasts \u223c 22 Myr (although it begins\nweakening at T \u223c \u03c4inf = 12.2 Myr), begins contracting\nat t \u223c 12.5 Myr and begins forming stars at t \u223c 17 Myr,\nwhile both runs with linf = 48 pc, for which the inflow\nlasts 11 Myr (begins weakening at t \u223c \u03c4inf = 5.2 Myr),\nstart to contract at t \u223c 8 Myr (recall that the inflows\nhave the same density and velocity in all runs). Run\nL128\u2206v0.24 begins forming stars at t = 15.75 Myr, and\nrun L128\u2206v0.66 does so at t = 13.77 Myr.\nThese results clearly suggest that a longer inflow duration delays the onset of both global collapse and star\nformation, in spite of the fact that the cloud formed by\nit is more massive. This is attributable to the fact that\nthe turbulence in the cloud is continuously driven by the\ninflow. This is verified by comparing the three components of the velocity dispersion for runs L256\u2206v0.17 and\nL128\u2206v0.24, respectively shown in fig. 5 (bottom) and\nfig. 9. Both runs show an initial transient peak in \u03c3x\nending at t \u2248 4 Myr. However, after this transient, \u03c3x\nin run L256\u2206v0.17 increases again, reaching a maximum\nof \u03c3x \u223c 8.5 km s\u22121 , and decreasing afterwards, until it\n\n\fMolecular Cloud Evolution II\nnearly stabilizes at a value \u03c3x \u223c 6 km s\u22121 at t \u223c 11.5\nMyr. During this time interval, \u03c3y \u2248 \u03c3z \u223c 4 km s\u22121 .\nInstead, in run L128\u2206v0.24, \u03c3x does not increase again\nafter the initial transient, and remains at a much more\nmoderate level of \u03c3x \u223c 5 km s\u22121 , while \u03c3y \u2248 \u03c3z \u223c\n3 km s\u22121 . Clearly, the turbulence level is significantly\nhigher in the longer-inflow run.\nNote that the delay in the onset of global collapse and\nof local star formation cannot be attributed to the amplitude of the initial velocity fluctuations in the inflow, since\nruns L128\u2206v0.24 and L256\u2206v0.17, which have comparable amplitudes, differ substantially in these times, while\nruns L128\u2206v0.24 and L128\u2206v0.66 begin global contraction at almost the same time and differ by only \u223c 15%\nin the time at which they begin forming stars, in spite\nof one having more than twice the velocity fluctuation\namplitude of the other. This leaves the inflow duration\nas the sole cause of delay of both the global and local\ncollapses.\n\nThe initial conditions in our simulations are assumed\nto consist exclusively of atomic gas. However, the final\ndensity and temperature conditions are typical of molecular clouds, so molecule formation must occur somewhere\nalong the way in the evolution of the clouds. One important shortcoming of our simulations is that they cannot distinguish between atomic and molecular gas, as no\nchemistry is included. Thus, we cannot directly tell from\nthe simulations how long does it take for star formation\nto begin after molecular gas forms. We can, nevertheless, measure the column density of the dense gas in\nstar-forming regions, and compare it to the estimates\nfor self-shielding given by Franco & Cox (1986) and\nHartmann, Ballesteros-Paredes & Bergin (2001), under\nsolar Galactocentric conditions of the background UV\nfield. The former authors find a threshold column\ndesity for self-shielding of Nss \u223c 5 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 ,\nwhile the latter authors quote values Nss \u223c 1\u2013\n2\u00d71021 cm\u22122 from van Dishoeck & Black (1988) and\nvan Dishoeck & Blake (1998). So, we take a reference\nvalue of Nss = 1021 cm\u22122 .\nFor comparison, in Table 2 we report the column densities of the dense gas in the first four regions of star\nformation in run L256\u2206v0.17 at the time immediately\nbefore they begin forming stars. We see that the column\ndensities fall in the range 0.5\u20132 \u00d71021 cm\u22122 , suggesting\nthat star formation locally occurs nearly simultaneously\nwith the conversion of the gas from atomic to molecular.\nMoreover, we can compare the time at which we expect\nthe bulk of the cloud to become molecular (i.e., the time\nat which the mean column density in the cloud is reaching\nNss ) with the time at which star formation begins in the\ncloud. A lower limit for the time at which the mean\ncolumn density in the cloud equals Nss is given by\nNss\nNss\n=\nMyr,\n2n0 vinf\n5.8 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122\n\nthat the bulk of the cloud is still expected to be predominantly atomic by the time star formation is beginning.\nTogether, these simple estimates suggest that stars\nform roughly simultaneously with the conversion of gas\nfrom atomic to molecular, with the local star forming regions being more advanced in the conversion process than the bulk of the cloud. In turn, this suggests\nthat our model cloud would be observed as a collection of predominantly molecular clumps immersed in a\nlarge, predominantly atomic, substrate. This suggestion is consistent with recent observations that substantial amounts of atomic gas coexist with the molecular\nphase in MCs (Li & Goldsmith 2003; Goldsmith & Li\n2005; Klaassen et al. 2005), with perhaps even warm\ngas mixed in (Hennebelle & Inutsuka 2006). Of course,\na more conclusive confirmation of these estimates must\nawait simulations in which the chemistry and radiative\ntransfer are properly taken care of.\n5. DISCUSSION\n5.1. Implications\n\n4.7. Local column density and star formation\n\ntss &\n\n9\n\n(13)\n\nwhere n0 and vinf have been defined in \u00a73.1. This estimate is a lower limit because, as mentioned in \u00a74.1,\nvinf is not constant, but actually decreases in time. For\nNss = 1021 cm\u22122 , we obtain tss & 17.3 Myr, suggesting\n\n5.1.1. Dynamic evolution and global versus local collapse\n\nThe results presented in \u00a74 provide general support\nto the scenario outlined in Elmegreen (1993b);\nBallesteros-Paredes, V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni & Scalo\n(1999); Ballesteros-Paredes, Hartmann & V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni\n(1999);\nHartmann, Ballesteros-Paredes & Bergin\n(2001); V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni, Ballesteros-Paredes & Klessen\n(2003); Hartmann (2003); Mac Low & Klessen (2004);\nHeitsch et al. (2005, 2006); V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al.\n(2006); Ballesteros-Paredes et al. (2006). The clouds in\nour simulations are never in a state of virial equilibrium\nbefore they convert most of their mass into stars. Instead, they are in a continuously evolving state, initially\nobtaining their mass and turbulence simultaneously as\nthey form out of the compression and cooling of diffuse\nwarm gas (see also Hennebelle & P\u00e9rault 1999, 2000;\nKoyama & Inutsuka 2002; Inutsuka & Koyama 2004).\nThe gas initially has negligible self-gravity compared to\nits thermal support, but it quickly becomes super-Jeans\nbecause of the compression, the cooling, and the mass\nincrease of the dense gas, until its self-gravitating\nenergy eventually becomes comparable with the sum\nof its thermal and turbulent energies, at which point\nit begins to undergo global collapse. After this time,\ngravity becomes the main driver of the large-scale\nmotions in these (semi-) decaying simulations, causing\na near-equipartition, |Eg | \u223c 2Ek , which however is\nindicative of collapse, not equilibrium.\nThe nonlinear density fluctuations induced by the turbulence collapse faster than the whole cloud, as they have\nshorter free-fall times, and star formation proceeds vigorously before global collapse is completed. This result\nis in contrast with the standard notion that linear density fluctuations cannot lead to fragmentation because\nthe fastest growing mode of gravitational instability in a\nnearly uniform medium is an overall contraction of the\nwhole medium (Larson 1985). Thus, a crucial role of\nthe turbulence in the medium is to create nonlinear density fluctuations that have shorter free-fall times than the\nentire cloud.\nThese results bring back the scenario of global\ncloud collapse proposed by Goldreich & Kwan (1974),\n\n\f10\n\nV\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al.\n\nbut with a twist that avoids the criticism of\nZuckerman & Palmer (1974), namely that MCs could\nnot be in global collapse because the star formation rate\nwould be exceedingly high. Our simulations suggest that\nMCs may be undergoing global gravitational contraction,\nbut the efficiency is reduced because local collapse events,\nwhich involve only a fraction of the total cloud mass, proceed faster than the global collapse. Once a sufficiently\nlarge number of stars have formed, their energy feedback\nmay partially or completely halt the collapse. Further reduction may be provided by supercritical magnetic fields\n(V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni, Kim & Ballesteros-Paredes 2005;\nNakamura & Li 2005). This scenario is consistent with\nthe recent proposal of Hartmann & Burkert (2006) that\nthe Orion A cloud may be undergoing gravitational collapse on large scales.\n5.1.2. Cloud's mass variation and cloud boundaries\n\nThe fact that the cloud's mass is not constant is equivalent to the property that the locus of a Lagrangian\nboundary of the cloud defined (by means of a threshold\ndensity) at any given time does not remain at the cloud's\nboundary as time progresses, but instead it is later incorporated into the interior of the cloud. This implies\nthat the cloud does not always consist of the same set\nof fluid parcels, and that in a virial balance analysis of\nthe cloud, there is non-zero flux of the physical variables\nthrough Eulerian boundaries defined at any given time\n(Ballesteros-Paredes, V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni & Scalo 1999;\nShadmehri, V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni & Ballesteros-Paredes\n2002; Dib et al 2006; Ballesteros-Paredes 2006).\n5.1.3. Absence of slow, accelerating star formation phase\n\nIt is important to note that the star formation rate\n(given by the slope of the mass in sinks versus time in\nfig. 5 [top]) is large from the start, and we observe no long\nperiod of slow, accelerating star formation, contrary to\nthe suggestion of Palla & Stahler (2000, 2002) that star\nformation accelerates in time. Problems with this suggestion have been discussed by Hartmann (2003), and,\nwithin the framework of their assumptions and limitations, our simulations do not confirm it. An important\nquestion is whether this result will persist when magnetic fields are included. It is possible that during the\nearly stages of the cloud's evolution, it may behave under magnetically subcritical conditions, giving very low\nstar formation rates (SFRs), and then transit into a supercritical regime, with higher SFRs (\u00a75.1.5).\n5.1.4. Latency period\n\nThe clouds in our simulations do spend a long latency period between the beginning of the compressive motion that creates the cloud and the time at\nwhich they begin forming stars (\u223c 14\u201317 Myr in the\nthree runs we have considered). However, this long\nperiod is most probably spent in the atomic phase,\nsince the column densities of the star-forming regions in the simulations are comparable to those required for molecule formation (Franco & Cox 1986;\nHartmann, Ballesteros-Paredes & Bergin 2001). More\nspecifically, Bergin et al. (2004) have found that the\ntimescale for CO molecule formation is essentially that\nrequired for reaching a dust extinction of AV \u223c\n\n0.7.\nNote also that during this time, the formation of H2 can be fast within density peaks\n(cores), even if most of the mass of the cloud is\nstill in the low-density regime (Pavlovski et al. 2002;\nGlover & Mac Low 2006). Thus, the concept of \"rapid\"\nstar formation refers to the time elapsed between the appearance of a (CO) molecular cloud and the onset star\nformation, as well as to the rate of the star formation\nprocess itself.\nNote that the latency period is in fact by definition of\nthe order of the crossing time of the entire large-scale\ncompressive wave, in agreement with observational evidence (Elmegreen 2000).\n5.1.5. Implications for HI envelopes and magnetic criticality\n\nThe formation of GMcs by an accumulation process\nsuch as the one modeled here has two important additional implications. First, because the process starts\nwith lower-density gas (the WNM in our simulations)\nthat is compressed by some external agent, GMCs,\nwhich are the \"tip of the iceberg\" of the density distribution, are expected to have in general HI envelopes,\nwhich would constitute the corresponding \"body of the\niceberg\". This gas would include transition material\ntraversing the unstable phase between the warm to the\ncold phases, which would appear to have a nearly isobaric behavior (Gazol, V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni & Kim 2005;\nAudit & Hennebelle 2005; V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al.\n2006), in agreement with the conclusion reached by\nAndersson & Wannier (1993) from observations of\nHI envelopes of MCs. Such envelopes are routinely\nobserved (e.g.,\nBlitz & Thaddeus 1980; Wannier\nLichten & Morris;\nAndersson, Wannier & Morris\n1991;\nAndersson & Wannier\n1993;\nBallesteros-Paredes, Hartmann & V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni\n1999; Brunt 2003; Blitz et al. 2006, see also the\ncombined HI and CO maps of Blitz & Rosolowsky\n2004). Weaker compressions than we have modeled\nmay produce mostly thin CNM sheets, with little or no\nmolecular gas, as discussed in V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al.\n(2006).\nSecond, this scenario of molecular cloud formation implies that the mass-to-flux ratio of the cloud is a variable quantity as the cloud evolves. This ratio is equivalent to the ratio of column density to magnetic field\nstrength (Nakano & Nakamura 1978), with the critical\ncolum density given by \u03a3 \u223c 1.5 \u00d7 1021 [B/5\u03bcG] cm\u22122 .\nAlthough in principle under ideal MHD conditions the\ncriticality of a magnetic flux tube involves all of the\nmass contained within it, in practice it is only the\nmass in the dense gas phase that matters, because\nthe diffuse gas is not significantly self-gravitating at\nthe size scales of MC complexes. As pointed out\nby Hartmann, Ballesteros-Paredes & Bergin (2001), the\nabove value of the dense gas' column density for magnetic\ncriticality is very close to that required for molecule formation (eq. [1]) and for gravitational binding (eq. [2]),\nand therefore, the cloud is expected to become magnetically supercritical nearly at the same time it is becoming\nmolecular and self-gravitating.\n5.2. Limitations and future work\n\nOur simulations are limited in a number of aspects.\nFirst and foremost, as already mentioned in \u00a73.2, one\n\n\fMolecular Cloud Evolution II\nmajor shortcoming of our simulations is the absence of\nfeedback from the stellar objects onto the cloud. This is\ncertainly an unrealistic feature. Second, our clouds are\nin a regime of turbulence decay after the inflows have\nsubsided. This may or may not be an unrealistic feature,\nand rather it may represent a fraction of the population\nof clouds. Finally, we have neglected magnetic fields altogether, due to the non-existence of suitable SPH algorithms including MHD for the problem of fully developed\nturbulent flows.\nAll of these limitations tend to exaggerate the SFE in\nour simulations, as the turbulence within them is not replenished by either a continuing flow or by stellar energy feedback. It is possible that a continued inflow\n(and therefore a sustained turbulence level) could prevent global collapse altogether, with only local collapse\nevents happening randomly, although certainly the inflows cannot last indefinitely. Thus, it would appear\nthat global collapse is inescapable. However, once star\nformation begins, the stellar energy feedback is likely\nto either be able to halt the global collapse and disperse the cloud (Franco, Shore & Tenorio-Tagle 1994;\nHartmann, Ballesteros-Paredes & Bergin 2001) or else\nmaintain it in rough equilibrium (e.g., Matzner 2002;\nNakamura & Li 2005; Tan, Krumholz & McKee 2006;\nKrumholz, Matzner & McKee 2006). Thus, two important questions to address in future papers are, one,\nwhat is the evolution like when star formation begins\nbefore the inflows subside. It is likely that this case\nwill have much smaller SFEs. Two, whether the stellar energy feedback tends to disperse the clouds, or\nelse to maintain them in rough equilibrium. Observationally, star clusters older than 5\u201310 Myr tend to\nbe already devoid of gas (Leisawitz, Bash & Thaddeus\n1989; Hartmann, Ballesteros-Paredes & Bergin 2001;\nBallesteros-Paredes & Hartmann 2006), suggesting that\nthe effect is more disruptive than equilibrating.\nFinally, our simulations have neglected the magnetic\nfield. As discussed in \u00a72, this is not a crucial omission\nif GMCs are in general magnetically supercritical, since\nthe supercritical case is qualitatively equivalent to the\nnonmagnetic case, with the only difference being that it\nbehaves as if it were less massive than a non-magnetic\ncloud of the same mass (Shu 1992; Hartmann 1998).\nThus, we consider that our models are still representative of the large-scale evolution up to the early times\nof star formation in supercritical clouds. The main difference is expected to be that magnetized, supercritical\nclouds should have lower SFEs than nonmagnetic ones\n(V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni, Kim & Ballesteros-Paredes 2005;\nNakamura & Li 2005). On the other hand, the evolution of subcritical clouds will certainly differ from the\nmodels presented here, because they will have no global\ntendency to collapse. At any rate, it is necessary to perform simulations of the full process in the presence of\nmagnetic fields. This will presumably require the usage\nof AMR techniques incorporating the analogue of sink\nparticles and stellar feedback, and will be pursued in future papers.\n6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have presented a suite of numerical simulations designed to investigate jointly the formation of molecular clouds (MCs) and of stars within\n\n11\n\nthem. The simulations use an SPH scheme including\nself-gravity, sink particles and cooling leading to thermal bistability. Magnetic fields are neglected. The simulations describe the collision of oppositely-directed gas\nstreams (\"inflows\") in the warm neutral medium (WNM)\nat moderately supersonic velocities (each with a velocity\nof 9.2 km s\u22121 , or a Mach number of 1.22 in the unperturbed WNM). Three simulations were considered, varying the length of the inflow and the amplitude of the\ninitial velocity fluctuations in the gas. The collisions trigger a transition to the cold phase in the gas, and simultaneously generate turbulence in the resulting \"cloud\",\ndefined as the gas at densities n > 50 cm\u22123 . The inflows secularly weaken in time, and so does the turbulence level in the cloud, implying that the turbulence\nin the clouds gradually transits from being continuously\ndriven to being in a decaying regime. The cooling and\nthe mass gain of the dense gas eventually cause the cloud\nto contain a large number of Jeans masses at the mean\nconditions. Moreover, because the cloud is supersonically\nturbulent, locally the density can be much larger, with\na correspondingly lower Jeans mass and shorter free-fall\ntimes than those of the whole cloud.\nThus, by the time the inflows have almost subsided,\nthe cloud engages in global gravitational collapse, but\nshortly thereafter it begins to produce numerous local\ncollapse events that occur on much smaller timescales\nbecause of the larger densities, so that by the time the\nglobal collapse of the cloud is completed, it has converted\nmost of its mass to collapsed objects (sink particles). The\nsinks in general represent star clusters, due to the limited\nmass resolution and lack of modeling of opacity-limited\nfragmentation (e.g. Bate, Bonnell & Bromm 2003). Our\nsimulations can only be considered reliable up to the time\nwhen the mass in collapsed objects (sinks) implies a high\nenough number of massive stars that they would disrupt\nthe cloud. Nevertheless, the evolution up to that point\nshows a number of relevant results:\n1. The clouds are never in virial equilibrium during this\nperiod. Instead, they continually evolve, increasing their\nmass and self-gravitating energy, until the latter becomes\ncomparable or larger than the thermal and kinetic energies. Some \u223c 5 Myr after global contraction began, star\nformation begins.\n2. In spite of not being in equilibrium, the nearequipartition condition |Eg | \u223c 2Ek is approximately satisfied as soon as |Eg | becomes comparable to Ek , because\nof the gravitational contraction of the cloud, with both\nquantities increasing simultaneously. This occurs long\nbefore the onset of star formation. This fact can explain\nthe observed state of apparent virialization of GMCs.\n3. The near equipartition is a signature of global gravitational collapse, not equilibrium, and suggests a return\nto Goldreich & Kwan's (1974) scenario of global gravitational contraction in MCs. However, the criticism\nby Zuckerman & Palmer (1974), namely that an excessively large star formation should result through this process, is avoided in part because the nonlinear turbulent\ndensity fluctuations collapse earlier than the whole cloud,\ninvolving only a fraction of the total mass, and in part because as soon as the stars form they probably contribute\nto dispersing the cloud, or at least halting its global col-\n\n\f12\n\nV\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al.\n\nlapse. Further reduction of the SFE may occur in the\npresence of supercritical magnetic fields.\n4. Local collapse events begin to occur after global collapse has begun, but they occur rapidly, requiring only\n\u223c 3 Myr to convert \u223c 15% of the cloud's mass into stars.\n\n5. The star formation rate, measured by the slope of the\nmass in stars versus time, is large from the beginning.\nWithin the framework, assumptions and limitations of\nour simulations, no long period of slow, accelerating star\nformation is observed.\n\n6. Longer inflow durations maintain larger turbulent velocity dispersions in the clouds and delay the onset of\nboth global and local collapse. Instead, larger amplitudes\nof the initial velocity fluctuations have little effect in delaying the collapse. The latter effect can be attributed\nto the fact that the turbulence is already dissipating in\nthe clouds by the time global collapse begins.\n7. A long period (\u223c 14\u201317 Myr) of \"dormancy\" does occur between the time when the cloud begins to form and\nthe time when star formation begins. Nevertheless, it is\nlikely that most of this time is spent with the gas being\nin atomic form, since the column density of star forming regions in our simulations are comparable to values\nrequired for molecular gas formation, as reported in the\nliterature. Thus, our simulations support the notion that\nstar formation occurs almost simultaneously with the formation of molecular gas, under local ISM conditions.\nWe conclude that our simulations support the\n\nscenario of rapid star formation after molecular gas has formed, involving accumulations of\ngas from distances of a few hundred parsecs\n(Hartmann, Ballesteros-Paredes & Bergin\n2001;\nV\u00e1zquez-Semadeni, Ballesteros-Paredes & Klessen\n2003), while simultaneously requiring timescales\nof the order of the crossing time across the\nlargest scales involved (Elmegreen 2000), and\nin\na\nsystematically out-of-equilibrium fashion\n(Ballesteros-Paredes, V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni & Scalo 1999;\nBallesteros-Paredes, Hartmann & V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni\n1999; Klessen, Heitsch & Mac Low 2000). However,\nthe evidence will have to be made more compelling as\nadditional physical processes, such as longer-duration\ninflows, stellar feedback, magnetic fields and chemistry\nare included.\n\nWe thankfully acknowledge useful comments from Lee\nHartmann and Chris McKee, and the help of Luis\nBallesteros-Paredes with postprocessing of the computer animations.

Within a cubic box measuring Lbox on a side, two cylindrical inflows, each of length linf , radius\nrinf , and aligned with the x-axis of the domain, are set to collide. The inflows have a velocity corresponding to Minf = 1.22 with respect\nto the undisturbed medium. Also, a fluctuating velocity field with amplitude vrms,i is added at the begining of the run in order to trigger\nthe dynamical instability of the resulting compressed layer. Table 1 lists the values used for these parameters.\n\n\f16\n\nV\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al.\n\nFig. 2.- Thermal-equilibrium pressure versus density for the cooling and heating functions given by eqs.

Bottom: Evolution of the velocity\ndispersion of the dense gas (n > 50 cm\u22123 ) in each of the three coordinate axes. From t \u2248 6 Myr through \u2248 12 Myr, \u03c3x decreases, reflecting\nthe smooth end of the inflows. At this time, the gravitational collapse of the cloud (in the yz plane) sets in, generating an increase in \u03c3y\nand \u03c3z . While initially unaffected by this collapse, \u03c3x increases starting at t \u2248 18 Myr, coinciding with the onset of star formation.\n\n\fMolecular Cloud Evolution II\n\n19\n\nFig. 6.- Evolution of the cloud mass and of the minimum mass that is not dispersed by stellar ionizing radiation under the two estimates\ngiven by eqs.
