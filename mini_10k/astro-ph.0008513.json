We present the results of near\u2013infrared Hband (1.65 \u03bcm) imaging of 19 steep spectrum radio\nquasars (SSRQ) in the redshift range 0.5 < z < 1.0. This\nsample of SSRQs is matched with our previously studied complete sample of 20 flat spectrum radio quasars\n(FSRQ) with respect to redshift and optical and radio\nluminosity. We are able to clearly detect the host galaxy\nin 10 (53 %) SSRQs and marginally in 6 (32 %) others,\nwhile the host remains unresolved in 3 (16 %) SSRQs.\nThe galaxies hosting the SSRQs are large (average bulge\nscale-length R(e) = 9.0\u00b11.7 kpc) and luminous (average\nM(H) = -27.2\u00b11.1). They are, therefore, \u223c2 mag more luminous than the typical galaxy luminosity L* (M*(H) =\n\u201325.0\u00b10.2), and \u223c1 mag more luminous than the brightest cluster galaxies (M(H) = \u201326.3\u00b10.3). The SSRQ hosts\nappear to have similar luminosity to those of the FSRQ\nhosts (M(H)\u223c\u201327), and they fall between the luminosities\nof lower redshift (M(H) \u223c\u201326) and higher redshift (M(H)\n\u223c\u201329) radio-loud quasars. The average nucleus\u2013to\u2013galaxy\nluminosity ratio of SSRQs (LN/LG = 3.8\u00b13.2) is much\nsmaller than that found for the FSRQs (LN/LG = 21\u00b111),\nin good agreement with the current unified models. We\nconfirm for the most luminous SSRQs the trend noted for\nthe FSRQs between the host and nuclear luminosity. This\ntrend supports the suggestion based on studies of lower\nredshift AGN, that there is a minimum host galaxy luminosity which increases linearly with the quasar luminosity.\nFinally, FSRQs seem to reside in richer environments than\nSSRQs, as evidenced by a larger number of close companion galaxies.\nKey words: Galaxies:active \u2013 Galaxies:nuclei \u2013 Infrared:galaxies \u2013 Quasars:general\n\n1.

Kotilainen\n\u22c6\nBased on observations collected at the European Southern\nObservatory, La Silla, Chile.\n\nare a fundamental tool to understand the quasar phenomenon, and AGN in general. Such studies can crucially\ntest models which attempt to unify different observed\nclasses of AGN either through evolution (e.g. Ellingson,\nYee & Green 1991) or orientation (e.g. Antonucci 1993;\nUrry & Padovani 1995). They can shed light on whether\ninteractions (as evidenced by close companions or disturbed morphology) are important for triggering and fueling of the quasar activity (e.g. Smith & Heckman 1990;\nHutchings & Neff 1992). These studies allow one to investigate the possible reciprocal effect of the AGN on the\nproperties and evolution of the hosts. Possible cosmological evolution of the AGN population (e.g. Small & Blandford 1992; Silk & Rees 1998) can be constrained by comparing the properties of the hosts and environments of\nAGN at different redshifts.\n<\n\nThe host galaxies of low redshift (z \u223c 0.3) quasars\nhave been thoroughly investigated using both groundbased imaging (e.g. McLeod & Rieke 1995; Taylor et al.\n1996; Percival et al. 2000) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST; e.g. Bahcall et al. 1997; Boyce et al. 1998;\nMcLure et al. 1999). These investigations have shown\nthat most quasars live in galaxies at least as bright as\nthe Shechter function's characteristic luminosity L\u2217 (e.g.\nMobasher, Sharples & Ellis 1993). While most quasar host\ngalaxies are brighter than L\u2217 , and in many cases comparable to brightest cluster member galaxies (BCM; Thuan\n& Puschell 1989), some undetected or marginally detected\nhosts may be under-luminous. Recent morphological studies of host properties at low z (e.g. Taylor et al. 1996; Percival et al. 2000) have concluded that while radio-loud\nquasars (RLQ) are found exclusively in giant elliptical\ngalaxies, radio-quiet quasars (RQQ) reside in both elliptical and spiral (disc dominated) galaxies. It has been\nsuggested that the morphological type may depend on\nthe power of the quasar, with the most luminous quasars\nfound only in spheroidal host galaxies (Taylor et al. 1996).\nClose companions have been found around many quasars\n(e.g. Hutchings 1995; Bahcall et al. 1997; Hutchings et\nal. 1999), some with signs of interaction, but the physical association has been confirmed only in some cases\n\n\f2\n\nJ.K.

At\nintermediate redshift (0.5 < z < 1), quasar hosts have been\nlittle investigated (e.g. Carballo et al. 1998; R\u00f6nnback et\nal. 1996). Recently, we studied in the near-infrared (NIR)\nthe host galaxies of a complete sample of 20 flat spectrum\nradio quasars (FSRQ) (most of which are at 0.5 < z <\n1) (Kotilainen, Falomo & Scarpa 1998; hereafter KFS98).\nWe were able to resolve the host galaxy in a substantial\nfraction (\u223c50 %) of them and found these highly polarized\nquasars to reside in galaxies of M(H)\u223c\u201327.\nWhile most FSRQs are characterized by rapid variability, high and variable polarization, high brightness temperatures, core\u2013dominated radio emission and confirmed\nor suspected superluminal motion (e.g. Impey & Tapia\n1990; Quirrenbach et al. 1992; Padovani & Urry 1992;\nVermeulen & Cohen 1994), very few of these characteristics are shared by the more common steep spectrum radio quasars (SSRQ). This difference is usually explained\nin the unified model in terms of synchrotron radiation\nstrongly relativistically beamed close to our line\u2013of\u2013sight\nin FSRQs, while SSRQs are viewed further away from the\nbeaming axis (Blandford & Rees 1978).\nWe present here deep high spatial resolution (\u223c0.\u2032\u2032 3\n\u22121\npx , \u2264 1\u2032\u2032 FWHM seeing) NIR H-band (1.65 \u03bcm) imaging study of the host galaxies of a sample of SSRQs in\nthe redshift range 0.5 < z < 1.

Finally, there is a marked difference in the L(11\ncm) distribution, in the sense that the FSRQ distribution\nextends to much higher radio luminosities than the SSRQ\nsample. This is due to the unfortunate circumstance that\nthere were not enough very radio-luminous SSRQs available at the time of the observations. This caveat should\nbe kept in mind in the following discussion.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. In section 2, we\nbriefly describe the observations, data reduction and the\nmethod of the analysis. Our results concerning the host\ngalaxies and the nuclear component are given in section 3\nand compared with the results for FSRQs. In section 4, we\nanalyze the close environment of SSRQs and FSRQs and,\nfinally, in section 5 summary and main conclusions of this\nstudy are drawn. In the Appendix, we give comments for\nindividual quasars. Throughout this paper, H0 = 50 km\ns\u22121 Mpc\u22121 and q0 = 0 are used.\n\n\f4\n\nJ.K. Kotilainen & R. Falomo: NIR imaging of SSRQ host galaxies\n\nor the centroid of the light distribution of the quasar as a\nreference point. Standard stars from Landolt (1992) were\nused for photometric calibration, for which we estimate\nan accuracy of \u223c0.1 mag, based on comparison of multiple observations at different nights with IRAC2 as listed in\nTable 1. K\u2013correction was applied to the host galaxy magnitudes following the method of Poggianti (1997). The applied K\u2013correction for each quasar is reported in Table 3.\nThis correction, insignificant at low redshift (m(H) = 0.03\nat z = 0.2), has to be taken into account at moderate redshifts (m(H)\u223c0.14 at our median redshift of z = 0.65). No\nK\u2013correction was applied to the nuclear component.\nAfter masking all the regions around the target contaminated by companions, azimuthally averaged radial luminosity profiles were extracted for each quasar and field\nstars out to the background noise level, corresponding to\na surface brightness of \u03bc(H) = 23\u201324 mag arcsec\u22122 . In the\nsmall field of view IRAC2 images, bright stars were present\nin the field of only a few quasars. For most quasars, the\ncore of the PSF was derived from faint field stars, while the\nwing was derived from separate observation of a nearby\nbright star or extrapolated using a suitable Moffat (1969)\nfunction obtained from fitting bright stars in other frames\nof similar seeing during the same night. In the much larger\nfield\u2013of\u2013view SOFI images, all quasars had bright stars in\nthe field, enabling a good PSF determination.\nThe luminosity profiles were fitted into a point source\n(PSF) and a galaxy (de Vaucouleurs law, convolved with\nthe PSF) component by an iterative least\u2013squares fit to\nthe observed profile. For these moderately high redshift\nquasars, data quality does not allow one to discriminate between elliptical and disk morphologies for the host\ngalaxy, and the elliptical model was assumed, as demonstrated to be the case for low redshift RLQs (e.g. Taylor\net al. 1996; Bahcall et al. 1997). For quasars with no host\ngalaxy detection, we determined an upper limit to the\nbrightness of the host galaxy by adding simulated \"host\ngalaxies\" of various brightness to the observed profile until\nthe simulated host became detectable within the errors of\nthe luminosity profile. For a detailed discussion of potential error sources in this fitting procedure, see KFS98. We\nestimate the uncertainty of the derived host galaxy magnitudes to be \u223c\u00b10.3 mag for the clearly detected hosts.\nFor the marginally detected hosts, we can only assess a\nlower limit to the error margin as \u2265\u00b10.5.\nFor the clearly detected hosts, there is expectedly\na good agreement between the total magnitude of the\nquasars derived from aperture photometry (Table 1, column 11) and that resulting from the profile fit (Table 3,\ncolumns 5 and 6), with average magnitude difference of\n\u20130.03\u00b10.12.\n3. Results and discussion\nIn Fig. 2, we show the H-band contour plots of all the\nSSRQs, after smoothing the images with a Gaussian filter\n\nof \u03c3 = 1 px. In Fig. 3 we show the radial luminosity profiles\nof each quasar, with the best\u2013fit decomposition overlaid.\nWe detect the host galaxy clearly for 10 (53 %) SSRQs and\nmarginally for 6 (32 %) more. The host remains unresolved\nfor 3 (16 %) SSRQs. We summarize the best\u2013fit model\nparameters of the profile fitting and the derived properties\nof the host galaxies in Table 3, where column (1) gives the\nname of the SSRQ, (2) the redshift, (3) the applied K\u2013\ncorrection, (4) the scale-length of the host galaxy, (5) \u2013 (6)\nthe apparent magnitude of the nucleus and the host, (7)\nthe nucleus/host luminosity ratio, (8) \u2013 (9) the absolute\nmagnitude of the nucleus and the host, and column (10)\nnote about the detection of the host.\nTable 4 presents a comparison of the H-band absolute\nmagnitudes of the SSRQ hosts with relevant samples from\nprevious studies in the literature, for which we report the\naverage values after correcting the published values for\ncolour term and to our cosmology. In the Appendix, we\ncompare our NIR photometry with the few previous studies, and discuss in more detail individual quasars, including comparison with the few previous optical/NIR determinations of the host galaxies.\n3.1. The host galaxies\nIn Fig. 4 (upper panel) we investigate the location of the\nSSRQ and FSRQ hosts in the H-band absolute magnitude vs. redshift diagram. In Fig. 4 (lower panel) we show\nthe same diagram for the mean value of various samples\nof RLQ and RQQ hosts from the literature. The average\nH-band absolute magnitude of the resolved SSRQ host\ngalaxies is M(H) = \u201327.2\u00b11.1 and the average bulge scalelength R(e) = 9.0\u00b11.7 kpc, while the values after adding\nthe marginally resolved hosts are M(H) = \u201327.0\u00b11.2 and\nR(e) = 8.6\u00b11.9 kpc. The SSRQ hosts are therefore large\n(all have R(e) > 3 kpc, the empirical upper boundary\nfound for normal local ellipticals by Capaccioli, Caon &\nD'Onofrio 1992), and very luminous, much brighter than\nthe luminosity of an L\u2217 galaxy, which has M(H) = \u2013\n25.0\u00b10.3 (Mobasher et al. 1993). It is therefore evident\nthat the SSRQ hosts are preferentially selected from the\nhigh\u2013luminosity tail of the galaxy luminosity function (the\nderived upper limits for the unresolved hosts are also consistent with this; see Table 3). Indeed, we find no case of\nan SSRQ host with M(H) > \u201325, indicating that for some\nreason these quasars cannot be hosted by a galaxy with L\n< L\u2217 , similarly to what was found by Taylor et al. (1996)\nfor low redshift RLQs. Although there is a large spread,\nthe SSRQ hosts are on average of similar luminosity to\nthose of FSRQ hosts (KFS98).\nThere is a suggestion of a positive correlation of host\nluminosity with redshift (Fig. 4, lower panel) as the FSRQ\nand SSRQ hosts fall between the luminosities of lower\nredshift (M(H) \u223c\u201326) and higher redshift (M(H) \u223c\u201329)\nRLQs. This is consistent with what is expected from passive stellar evolution models for elliptical galaxies (e.g.\n\n\fJ.K. Kotilainen & R. Falomo: NIR imaging of SSRQ host galaxies\n\n5\n\nFig. 2. Gaussian (\u03c3 = 1 px) smoothed contour plots of the SSRQs in the H-band. The SSRQ is the object in the\ncenter of the frame. The full size of the image is 60 px across (corresponding to 16.\u2032\u2032 7 and 17.\u2032\u2032 5 for IRAC2 and SOFI\ndata, respectively). The contours are separated by 0.5 mag intervals.

On\nthe other hand, it is not consistent with models of hierarchical galaxy formation (e.g. Kaufmann & H\u00e4hnelt 2000),\nwhich predict \u223cL\u2217 hosts at z = 2 \u2013 3 that afterwards undergo mergers to become present-day giant elliptical hosts.\nThe detected correlation, therefore, suggests that major\nmerging has already happened at z = 2 - 3. Also, this is\nconsistent with the discovery of ellipticals with old stellar\npopulations even at z\u223c2 (e.g. Spinrad et al. 1997; Stiavelli\net al. 1999). However, this scenario seems not to be valid\nfor RQQs, which show no or little evolution with redshift,\n\nas evidenced by the non-detection of high redshift RQQ\nhosts (Lowenthal et al. 1995).\nOn the other hand, the detected correlation can be interpreted as evidence for a relationship between optical\nand radio luminosities. Ledlow & Owen (1996) found such\na correlation for radio galaxies and in the unified model\n(e.g. Urry & Padovani 1995), where RLQs and radio galaxies are identical objects seen from different viewing angles,\nthis relationship is expected also to exist between the radio luminosities and host galaxy absolute magnitudes for\nRLQs at different redshifts.\nMost of the available comparison data from literature\nare for low and intermediate redshift RLQs.

The average host galaxy magnitudes for the various samples are given in Table 4 in order of increasing\naverage redshift. Considering all these samples together\ngives average host magnitude of M(H) = \u201326.2\u00b10.7. As\ncan be seen from Fig. 4, there is no significant difference\namong the average values of these low z samples. The average M(H) = \u201327.0\u00b11.2 for the SSRQ hosts is therefore\n\u223c1 magnitude brighter than the luminosity of low z RLQ\nwhich suggests evolution in the host brightness with red-\n\nshift, and/or a relationship of the host luminosity with the\nnuclear luminosity (see section 3.2).\nIt is worth to compare these data also with those for\nsamples of low redshift RQQs extracted from the literature. The average host galaxy magnitudes for the various samples are given in Table 4. Considering all these\nRQQ samples together yields an average host magnitude\nof M(H) = \u201325.4\u00b10.4, \u223c1 magnitude fainter than comparable redshift RLQ hosts and \u223c1.5 mag fainter than SSRQ\nhosts at intermediate redshift, indicating that RLQs and\n\n\fJ.K.

However, this\ndifference may also be due to the above mentioned correlation between optical and radio luminosities (Ledlow &\nOwen 1996), in the sense that RQQ surveys select objects\naccording to the optical luminosity, while RLQ surveys\nselect objects with high radio luminosity and, therefore, a\nbright host galaxy.\nLehnert et al. (1992, 1999) have reported spatially\nresolved structures around RLQs at z\u223c1.5 and z\u223c2.3\nthat, if interpreted as host galaxies, would correspond\nto extremely luminous galaxies with average M(H) = \u2013\n29.1\u00b11.1, \u223c2 mag brighter than the FSRQs and SSRQs\nat z\u223c0.7. However, within the scatter involved in these\nnumbers, our results appear to be consistent with those of\nLehnert et al., for the trend between the nuclear and host\ngalaxy luminosities (see section 3.2), and is supporting\nevidence for the existence of a real upturn in the host luminosity occurring between z\u223c0.5 and z\u223c2, leading from\nL\u2265L* hosts at low redshift to the host galaxies of high redshift quasars that are several magnitudes brighter than L*\n(see Fig. 4). While this type of change is consistent with\nevolution of the stellar population in the elliptical hosts (as\nargued for high redshift RGs by Lilly & Longair 1984), or\nbeing intrinsic AGN luminosity effect (as argued for high\nredshift RGs by Eales et al. 1997), there are many caveats\nin this comparison, most notably differences in the intrinsic quasar luminosity of the various samples. In addition,\noptical and NIR imaging by Lowenthal et al. (1995) failed\nto detect extended emission in a sample of six RQQs at\nz\u223c2.3. Their upper limits (average m(H) > 18.8\u00b10.4 and\nM(H) < -28.4\u00b10.6) indicate that the RQQ hosts at high\n\nredshift must be \u22643 mag brighter than L* and \u22651 mag\nfainter than those found in the Lehnert et al. (1992) sample of RLQs at similar redshift and with roughly similar\nnuclear luminosity, again suggesting that RLQs and RQQs\nare different types of objects.\nIt is well established that elliptical galaxies form families of homologous systems with characteristic parameters\nR(e), \u03bc(e) and velocity dispersion \u03c3. These are commonly\nrepresented in the Fundamental Plane (e.g. Djorgovski &\nDavis 1987). These relations have been claimed to be related to the morphological and dynamical structure of the\ngalaxies, and to their formation process. We have investigated the properties of the SSRQ and FSRQ hosts in\nthe projected Fundamental Plane (F-P) concerning the\neffective surface brightness \u03bc(e) and the effective radius\nR(e). Surface brightness \u03bc(e) was corrected for Galactic\nextinction, K\u2013correction and for the (1+z)4 cosmological\ndimming. Fig. 5 shows the correlation between \u03bc(e) and\nlog R(e) for the SSRQ and FSRQ hosts. It can be seen\nthat the behavior of the SSRQ and FSRQ hosts are similar. Both follow the Kormendy (1977) relation for giant\nmassive ellipticals (e.g. Capaccioli et al. 1992). No host\ngalaxy is in the (scatter) area at log R(e) < 0.5 kpc. This\nconfirms that the SSRQ and FSRQ hosts are exclusively\ndrawn from the population of giant ellipticals.\n3.2.

This is likely due to\na selection effect present in the original samples induced\nby the different average redshift. On the other hand, the\nSSRQ nuclei are \u223c1.5 mag fainter than the nuclei of FSRQs (KFS98; M(H) = \u201329.7\u00b10.8) in the similar redshift\nrange. This difference is even more evident when considering the nucleus/galaxy (LN/LG) luminosity ratio, shown\nin Fig. 6. The average LN/LG ratios are 3.8\u00b13.2 and\n21\u00b111 for the SSRQs and FSRQs, respectively. The large\nrange in the luminosity ratio can be due to differences in\nthe intrinsic nuclear or host luminosity, or a difference in\nthe beaming factor from one object to another. Whereas\nthe majority of the FSRQs have LN/LG > 10 in the Hband, only one SSRQ is above this limit, and the distribution of the LN/LG ratio for the SSRQs is similar to that\nof the low redshift RLQs (e.g. Taylor et al. 1996).\nFrom Fig. 4 it appears that the host galaxies of the various samples are not dramatically different in intrinsic luminosity, especially if stellar evolution in the elliptical host\ngalaxies is taken into account. Therefore, Fig. 6 clearly indicates that SSRQs exhibit a nuclear component which is\nsystematically brighter than that of lower redshift RLQs\nand RQQs, but fainter than that of the FSRQs. This is\nconsistent with the beaming model with larger Doppler\n\namplification factor for FSRQs than SSRQs, that makes\nthe observed differences understandable.\nIn Fig. 7, we show the relation between the luminosities\nof the nucleus and the host galaxy for the SSRQs and\nFSRQs. We confirm for the SSRQs the tendency noted for\nFSRQs by KFS98 for the more powerful quasars to reside\nin more luminous hosts, in the sense that there appears\nto be a lower limit to the host luminosity, which increases\nwith the quasar luminosity. All the SSRQs and FSRQs\nappear consistent with this boundary limit, first proposed\nby McLeod & Rieke 1995).\nRecent dynamical investigations of nearby galaxies\nhave reported evidence for supermassive black holes in\ntheir nuclei (Kormendy & Richstone 1995; Magorrian et\nal. 1998). Assuming that quasar activity results from accretion of material onto a supermassive black hole, the\nnucleus-host relationship is in agreement with that found\nby Magorrian et al. (1998) from HST kinematic study between the mass (luminosity) of the black hole and the\nmass (luminosity) of the spheroidal component in nearby\ngalaxies. Our results for SSRQs and FSRQs therefore\nsuggest that the Magorrian et al. relationship extends\nto host galaxy masses at cosmological distances. On the\nother hand, the much weaker correlation found for more\nnearby, lower luminosity AGN (e.g. McLeod & Rieke 1995;\nMcLeod, Rieke & Storrie-Lombardi 1999) may indicate\n\n\fJ.K. Kotilainen & R.

For example, at highest luminosities (highest\nblack hole masses) quasars may accrete near the Eddington limit, triggering the onset of the host - black hole\ncorrelation (Lacy et al. 2000).\nHowever, we advise caution about obvious selection\neffects that may de-populate the upper left hand (faint\nnuclei are difficult to detect against luminous hosts) and\nlower right hand (faint hosts are difficult to detect under luminous nuclei) corners of the diagram. Moreover, it\nis not clear if this boundary limit depends on the radio\nloudness since a recent investigation of luminous RQQs at\nz \u223c 0.3 (Percival et al. 2000) does not find any correlation\nbetween host and nuclear luminosities.\n4.

Spectroscopy of these\ncompanions (e,g. Stockton 1978; Heckman et al. 1984)\nhas shown that the companions are at the redshift of the\nquasar and are therefore physically associated. These observations have sustained the potentially important idea\nthat nuclear activity can be triggered and/or fueled by\nstrong tidal interactions and/or galaxy mergers (e.g. Heckman 1990)\nAlthough both RLQs and RQQs seem to occur in dense\ngroups of galaxies (and only rarely are located in rich\ngalaxy clusters), a systematic difference of environment\nis found between RLQs and RQQs in the sense that the\nlatter are generally found in poorer fields (e.g. Ellingson et\nal. 1991). There have also been some suggestions (Stockton 1978; Hutchings & Neff 1990) that FSRQs (and in\ngeneral, core-dominated RLQs) have a smaller frequency\nof companions with respect to the more common SSRQs.\nThese differences, if confirmed, are important for understanding the connection between the characteristics of the\nnuclear activity and the environment.\nTo investigate these differences, we have compared\nthe frequency of companions found around the matched\nsamples of SSRQs and FSRQs.

Contrary to previous suggestions (Stockton\n1978; Hutchings & Neff 1990), we find that the immediate\nenvironment of FSRQs is comparably rich (and possibly\neven richer) than that of SSRQs. This argues against a\npossible tight connection between the formation/evolution\nof the radio structure and the quasar galaxy environment.\n5. Conclusions\nWe have presented near\u2013infrared H-band images of 19\nSSRQs in the redshift range 0.5 < z < 1 with the aim\nof studying the quasar environment (host galaxies and\ncompanions) in comparison with our previously studied\nmatched sample of FSRQs with respect to redshift and\noptical and radio luminosity. We are able to clearly detect the host galaxy in 10 (53 %) SSRQs and marginally\nin 6 (32 %) others, while the host remains unresolved\nin 3 (16 %) cases. The galaxies hosting the SSRQs are\nlarge (average bulge scale-length R(e) = 9.0\u00b11.7 kpc) and\nluminous (average M(H) = -27.2\u00b11.1). They are, therefore, \u223c2 mag more luminous than the typical galaxy luminosity L* (M*(H) = \u201325.0\u00b10.2), and \u223c1 mag more\nluminous than the brightest cluster galaxies (M(H) = \u2013\n26.3\u00b10.3). The SSRQ hosts appear to have similar luminosity as those of the FSRQ hosts (M(H)\u223c\u201327). On the\nother hand, the average nucleus\u2013to\u2013galaxy luminosity ratio of SSRQs (LN/LG = 3.8\u00b13.2) is significantly smaller\nthan that found for the FSRQs (LN/LG = 21\u00b111), in\nagreement with the idea that the latter are beamed. We\nfind for SSRQs a positive trend, noted earlier for the FSRQs, between the host and nuclear luminosity. Finally, we\nfind that the number of close companion galaxies is not\nstrongly influenced by the characteristics of radio emission. Comparable (and possibly larger in FSRQ) densities\nof companions are observed for FSRQs and SSRQs,\nAcknowledgements.

The rather short exposure time for this\nquasar resulted in limiting surface brightness of only \u03bclim\n= 21. The quasar remains unresolved with a poor fit of\nthe PSF in the center.\nPKS 1327-21. Glass (1981) measured K = 14.28\u00b10.24\nin a 12\u2032\u2032 aperture, brighter than our H = 15.1. Again, the\nfit with the PSF does not match well in the central pixel.\nThe quasar is marginally resolved with a reasonably good\nPSF + elliptical fit, with MH = -25.4 and Re = 8.0 kpc.\nWyckoff, Wehringer & Gehren (1981) did not resolve the\n\n\f14\n\nJ.K.

Romanishin & Hintzen (1989) resolved\nthe host galaxy in the optical with M(B) = -23.7 and\nR(e) = 7.2 kpc. The radio morphology of this quasar\nis a bent triple with bridges connecting the components\n(Price et al. 1993, Bogers et al. 1996). It appears that\nwe have detected NIR emission from the NW hot spot\nand its associated radio lobe, to the NW and N of the\nquasar (Fig. 2). However, the SE hot spot and lobe are\nnot detected in our image.\nReferences\nAntonucci,R.R.J., 1993, ARA&A 31, 473\nBahcall,J.N., Kirhakos,S., Saxe,D.H., Schneider,D.P.,\n1997, ApJ 479, 642\nBlandford.R.D., Rees,M.J., 1978, Pittsburgh Conference\non BL Lac Objects (ed.
