Introduction\nThe fields of semiconductor physics and electronics have been successfully combined for\nmany years. The invention of the transistor meant a revolution for electronics and has\nled to significant development of semiconductor physics and its industry. More recently,\nthe use of the spin degree of freedom of electrons, as well as the charge, has attracted\ngreat interest [1, 2]. In addition to applications for spin electronics (spintronics) in\nconventional devices, for instance based on the giant magneto-resistance effect [3]\nand spin-polarized field-effect transistors [4], there are applications that exploit the\nquantum coherence of the spin. This was encouraged by ground-breaking experiments\nthat showed coherent spin transport over long distances in semiconductors and long\nelectron-spin dephasing times, on the order of 100 nanoseconds [5, 6]. In addition,\nspin-polarized carrier injection from magnetic to non-magnetic semiconductors has been\ndemonstrated [7, 8]. Since the electron spin is a two-level system, it is a natural candidate\nfor the realization of a quantum bit (qubit) [9]. A qubit is the basic unit of information in\nquantum computation, a discipline which attempts to radically improve the performance\nof computers by exploiting the quantum properties of the system used as hardware. The\nconfinement of electrons in semiconductor structures like quantum dots allows for better\ncontrol and isolation of the electron spin from its environment. Control and isolation\nare important issues to consider for the design of a quantum computer.\nThe field of quantum computing was born in the 80's, motivated by the\nminiaturization of electronic devices. Moore's-law predictions on the exponential growth\nof the transistor density in microchips raises the question of the possible future direction\nof the electronics industry. In particular, since small (\u223cnm) systems are governed by\nthe laws of quantum mechanics, nanoscale hardware components must show quantum\nbehaviour. Since computers are built-up from these electronic components, this leads\nto the idea of quantum computers. A different approach brought Richard Feynman to\nthe concept of quantum computing [10]. The simulation of the dynamics of quantum\nsystems on conventional computers is a hard task, meaning that the computational\nresources needed to simulate a quantum system increase exponentially with its size;\nthe states of a quantum system are represented as elements in a Hilbert space, and\ntherefore, the dimension of the space needed to describe the state of n qubits is 2n .\nThus, the simulation of n qubits requires an exponential number (2n ) of classical bits.\nFeynman's idea was that this problem could be solved by simulating the object of study\nwith a system of the same nature; in this case it implies the use of a quantum device to\nsimulate a quantum system.\nThe efficient solution of problems that were previously considered intractable has\naroused some interest. Researchers have begun thinking about how to exploit the\nquantum properties of a system to perform calculations. Following early work by David\nDeutsch on the power of universal quantum computing [11], one of the first practical\nquantum algorithms was presented by David Deutsch and Richard Jozsa in 1992 [12].\nThe problem it solves is very simple (it determines whether a function is constant or\n\n\fRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\n\n3\n\nbalanced), but it showed for the first time an advantage in using quantum mechanics\nfor computing. In 1994 quantum computation captured world-wide attention, as Peter\nShor presented his quantum algorithm for the prime factorization of integers [13]. This\nhad a significant impact due to the striking advantage of this algorithm with respect\nto its classical counterparts. The time required to factor a number N on a classical\ncomputer with currently-known algorithms grows exponentially with the number of\n\u03b1\ndigits log N (\u221d e(log N ) ), while in the case of Shor's algorithm, the growth is bounded\nby a polynomial (\u221d (log N)\u03b1 ) [14]. In addition to this fundamental breakthrough in\ncomputational complexity, Shor's algorithm also has potential practical relevance; the\ndifficulty of the factorization problem is the key to the security of cryptographic codes.\nThese codes include the RSA (Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman) encryption scheme, widely\nused in the Internet, at banks and in secret services. Nevertheless, there is still no\nformal proof that Shor's algorithm outperforms any potential classical algorithm. This is\ndifferent from the case of another quantum algorithm created by Lov Grover in 1997 [15],\nwhich shows a definite improvement over the classical case, although the speed-up is\nless impressive than for Shor's algorithm. Grover's algorithm is designed to perform a\nsearch in an unsorted \u221adatabase. The time required to find one desired element out of\nN is proportional to N , while in the classical case it is proportional to N. At the\nsame time that the first quantum algorithms were proposed, the first quantum error\ncorrecting codes were developed. The possibility to implement error correcting codes\nencouraged researchers to work on physical implementations of quantum computers,\nsince these codes relax the demands on control over noise and undesired interactions\nof the computer with the surrounding environment. Since the appearance of the first\nquantum algorithms, quantum computation has undergone a rapid development and\ngrowth, both from the theoretical and applied points of view. Many setups have been\nproposed for the hardware of a quantum computer [9, 16, 17, 18, 19], arising from\ndifferent fields of research including cold trapped atoms, nuclear magnetic resonance,\nJosephson junctions, and electrons in quantum dots, just to mention a few. The\nsort of physical attributes exploited in each case for the representation, storage and\nmanipulation of information varies over a wide range.\nFormally, a quantum computation is performed through a set of transformations,\ncalled gates [20]. A gate applies a unitary transformation U to a set of qubits in a\nquantum state |\u03a8i. At the end of the calculation, a measurement is performed on the\nqubits (which are in the state |\u03a8\u2032 i = U |\u03a8i). There are many ways to choose sets of\nuniversal quantum gates. These are sets of gates from which any computation can be\nconstructed, or at least approximated as precisely as desired. Such a set allows one\nto perform any arbitrary calculation without inventing a new gate each time. The\nimplementation of a set of universal gates is therefore of crucial importance. It can be\nshown that it is possible to construct such a set with gates that act only on one or two\nqubits at a time [21].\nThe successful implementation of a quantum computer demands that some basic\nrequirements be fulfilled. These are known as the DiVincenzo criteria [22] and can be\n\n\fRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\n\n4\n\nsummarized in the following:\n(i) Information storage\u2013the qubit: We need to find some quantum property of a scalable\nphysical system in which to encode our bit of information, that lives long enough\nto enable us to perform computations.\n(ii) Initial state preparation: It should be possible to set the state of the qubits to 0\nbefore each new computation.\n(iii) Isolation: The quantum nature of the qubits should be tenable; this will require\nenough isolation of the qubit from the environment to reduce the effects of\ndecoherence.\n(iv) Gate implementation: We need to be able to manipulate the states of individual\nqubits with reasonable precision, as well as to induce interactions between them\nin a controlled way, so that the implementation of gates is possible. Also, the\ngate operation time \u03c4s has to be much shorter than the decoherence time T2 , so\nthat \u03c4s /T2 \u226a r, where r is the maximum tolerable error rate for quantum error\ncorrection schemes to be effective.\n(v) Readout: It must be possible to measure the final state of our qubits once the\ncomputation is finished, to obtain the output of the computation.\nTo construct quantum computers of practical use, we emphasize that the scalability\nof the device should not be overlooked. This means it should be possible to enlarge\nthe device to contain many qubits, while still adhering to all requirements described\nabove. It should be mentioned here that this represents a challenging issue in most of\nthe physical setups proposed so far. In this respect, very promising schemes for quantum\ncomputation are the proposals based on solid-state qubits [9, 17, 19, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27,\n28, 29, 30], which could take advantage of existing technology. In the following, we will\nconcentrate on proposals based on solid-state qubits, describing them in more detail and\nsummarizing recent achievements in the field.\n\n\fRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\n\n5\n\n2. Proposals for quantum computing\nBefore even the most rudimentary quantum circuits can be built, the elementary\nregisters (qubits) and quantum gates must be designed. If any proposed design is to\nbe considered for experiment, it should first be subjected to a battery of theoretical\ntests to ensure its feasibility in real physical situations. The five DiVincenzo criteria\n[22] (introduced in section 1) provide a simple checklist for the basic requirements of\nany physically realizable quantum computer. Demonstrating strong adherence to these\ncriteria is a daunting task, which requires a broad understanding of material properties,\nphysical phenomenology and the quantum mechanical time evolution of these systems.\nTo make matters worse, a quantum computer, by necessity, must remain in a phasecoherent state far from thermodynamic equilibrium under conditions of strong timedependent inter-qubit interactions (required for gating operations). These conditions\nare beyond the reach of much of the theoretical physicist's toolbox and therefore make\nthe development of new proposals both a challenging and exciting endeavour.\nThe first proposals for quantum computing made use of cavity quantum\nelectrodynamics (QED) [31], trapped ions [18], and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)\n[16]. All of these proposals benefit from potentially long decoherence times, relative\nto their respective gating times (however, see section 2.8 below for a discussion of the\nrelative decoherence times in trapped ion systems that have been realized in experiment).\nIn all three cases, this is due to a very weak coupling of the qubits to their environment.\nThe long decoherence times for these proposals and existing experimental expertise led\nto quick success in achieving experimental realizations. A conditional phase gate was\ndemonstrated early-on in cavity-QED systems [32]. The two-qubit controlled-not gate,\nwhich, along with single-qubit rotations allows for universal quantum computation [21]\nhas been realized in single-ion [33] and two-ion [34] versions. The most remarkable\nrealization of the power of quantum computing to date is the implementation of Shor's\nalgorithm [13] to factor the number 15 in a liquid-state NMR quantum computer [35].\nIn spite of their great successes, the proposals based on cavity-QED, trapped ions and\nNMR may not satisfy the first DiVincenzo criterion. Specifically, these proposals may\nnot meet the requirement that the quantum computer can be scaled-up to contain a large\nnumber of qubits [9]. The requirement for scalability motivated the Loss-DiVincenzo\nproposal [9] for a solid-state quantum computer based on electron spin qubits. This\nproposal was quickly followed by a series of proposals for alternate solid-state realizations\n[19, 23, 24, 17, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30] and realizations for trapped atoms in optical lattices\nthat may also be scalable [36, 37]. In the following sections we give a non-exhaustive\nsurvey of some of these proposals. The goal of this survey is to demonstrate how the\nvarious requirements for quantum computing have been met through example.\n2.1. Quantum dot quantum computing\nThe qubits of the Loss-DiVincenzo quantum computer are formed from the two spin\nstates (|\u2191i , |\u2193i) of a confined electron. The considerations discussed in this proposal are\n\n\fRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\n\n6\n\nFigure 1. Two neighbouring electron spins confined to quantum dots, as in the\nLoss-DiVincenzo proposal. The lateral confinement is controlled by top gates. A\ntime-dependent Heisenberg exchange coupling J(t) can be pulsed high by pushing\nthe electron spins closer, generating an appreciable overlap between the neighbouring\norbital wave functions.\n\ngenerally applicable to electrons confined to any structure, such as atoms, molecules,\netc., although the original proposal focuses on electrons localized in quantum dots.\nThese dots are typically generated from a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), in\nwhich the electrons are strongly confined in the vertical direction. Lateral confinement is\nprovided by electrostatic top gates, which push the electrons into small localized regions\nof the 2DEG (see figures 1 and 2). Alternative quantum-dot structures are discussed\nin section 4. Initialization of the quantum computer can be achieved by allowing all\nspins to reach their thermodynamic ground state at low temperature T in an applied\nmagnetic field B (i.e., virtually all spins will be aligned if the condition |g\u03bcB B| \u226b kB T\nis satisfied, with g-factor g, Bohr magneton \u03bcB , and Boltzmann's constant kB ). Several\nalternative initialization schemes have been investigated (see sections 4.5 and 4.9).\nSingle-qubit operations can be performed, in principle, by changing the local effective\nZeeman interaction at each dot individually. To do this may require large magnetic field\ngradients [38], g-factor engineering [39], magnetic layers (see figure 2), the inclusion of\nnearby ferromagnetic dots [9], polarized nuclear spins, or optical schemes (see section\n5.2). In the Loss-DiVincenzo proposal, two-qubit operations are performed by pulsing\nthe electrostatic barrier between neighbouring spins. When the barrier is high, the spins\nare decoupled. When the inter-dot barrier is pulsed low, an appreciable overlap develops\nbetween the two electron wave functions, resulting in a non-zero Heisenberg exchange\ncoupling J. The Hamiltonian describing this time-dependent process is given by\nH(t) = J(t)SL * SR .\n\n(1)\n\nThis Hamiltonian induces a unitary evolution given by the operator U =\n\b R\nT exp \u2212i H(t)dt/~ , where T is the time-ordering operator. If the exchange is\nR\npulsed on for a time \u03c4s such that J(t)dt/~ = J0 \u03c4s /~ = \u03c0, the states of the two\n\n\fRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\n\n7\n\nFigure 2. An array of exchange-coupled quantum dots. Top gates provide lateral\nconfinement and allow pulsing of the exchange interaction for two-qubit operations (in\nthis image the two dots on the left are decoupled, whereas the two dots on the right\nare coupled). Back gates could pull electrons down into a region of higher g-factor to\nallow single-qubit operations in conjunction with applied constant (B\u22a5 ) and rf (Bkac )\nmagnetic fields.\n\nspins, with associated operators SL and SR , as shown in figure 1, will be exchanged.\nThis is the swap operation. Pulsing the exchange for the shorter time \u03c4s /2 generates\nthe \"square-root of swap\" operation, which can be used in conjunction with singlequbit operations to generate the controlled-not (quantum xor) gate [9]. In addition\nto the time scale \u03c4s , which gives the time to perform a two-qubit operation, there\nis a time scale associated with the rise/fall-time of the exchange J(t). This is the\nswitching time \u03c4sw . When the relevant two-spin Hamiltonian takes the form of an\nideal (isotropic) exchange, as given in (1), the total spin is conserved while switching.\nHowever, to avoid leakage to higher orbital states during gate operation, the exchange\ncoupling must be switched adiabatically. More precisely, \u03c4sw \u226b 1/\u03c90 \u2248 10\u221212 s, where\n~\u03c90 \u2248 1 meV is the energy gap to the next orbital state [9, 40, 41, 42]. We stress that\nthis time scale is valid only for the ideal case of a purely isotropic exchange interaction.\nWhen the exchange interaction is anisotropic, different spin states may mix and the\nrelevant time scale for adiabatic switching may be significantly longer. For scalability,\nand application of quantum error correction procedures in any quantum computing\nproposal, it is important to turn off inter-qubit interactions in the idle state. In the\nLoss-DiVincenzo proposal, this is achieved with exponential accuracy since the overlap\nof neighbouring electron wave functions is exponentially suppressed with increasing\nseparation. A detailed investigation of decoherence during gating due to a bosonic\nenvironment was performed in the original work of Loss and DiVincenzo. Since then,\nthere have been many studies of leakage and decoherence in the context of the quantumdot quantum computing proposal. We discuss some of these studies in section 3, after\nreviewing alternative solid-state proposals for quantum computing.\n\n\fRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\n\n8\n\n2.2. Superconducting qubits\nAmong the first proposals for solid-state quantum computing were qubits based on\nsuperconducting Josephson junctions [43, 44, 23, 19, 45]. These proposals were quick\nto take advantage of the macroscopic quantum coherence afforded in such structures,\nand a large and well-developed literature on their non-equilibrium dynamics [46]. The\ndevelopment of new designs for superconducting qubits has become an industry unto\nitself. There are, for example, designs that exploit the d-wave pairing symmetry of\ncuprate high-temperature superconductors [47, 48] and Andreev bound states [49].\nThe observation of coherent oscillations in superconducting qubits [50, 51] was a\nwatershed for the field of solid-state quantum information, demonstrating conclusively\nthat quantum coherence could be generated and sustained for many precession periods\n(\u223c 104 in the experiment by Vion et al. [50]). More recent achievements of the\nsuperconducting proposals include the demonstration of a controlled-not gate [52] and\nthe controlled coupling of a superconducting qubit to a single microwave photon mode\n[53]. In spite of these successes, the reduced visibility of coherent oscillations and the\nparticular sources and nature of decoherence for these devices remains the subject of\ninvestigations [54, 55, 56]. Extensive reviews of Josephson-junction qubits can be found\nin references [57, 58].\n2.3. Quantum computing and the quantum Hall effect\nBased on observed long lifetimes for nuclear spin states, Privman et al. [24]\nhave proposed a quantum computer composed of nuclear spins embedded in a twodimensional electron gas (2DEG) in the quantum-Hall regime. The qubits of their\nproposal are encoded in the states of nuclear spins, which must be sufficiently separated\nto avoid dipolar coupling, but close enough (\u223c 10 nm) to allow significant interaction\nvia the electron gas. Initialization of the qubits is achieved by placing spin-polarized\nconducting strips with a current of electrons above the nuclear spin qubits. The\ncontact hyperfine interaction between electron and nuclear spins causes a polarization\ntransfer from the electrons in the strips to the nuclear spins, preferentially orienting\nthe nuclear spins along the electron spin polarization direction. Readout is performed\nin a complementary manner, with a transfer of polarization from the nuclear spins to\nelectrons in the conducting strips. Single-qubit operations are performed via standard\nNMR pulses, which would require strong magnetic field gradients or many different\nnuclear spin species to bring single specific nuclear spins into resonance, while leaving\nthe other qubits unchanged. A pairwise interaction between the nuclear spin qubits is\nnecessary for the implementation of two-qubit gates. This interaction is generated by\na superexchange, mediated by electrons in the quantum Hall fluid that surrounds the\nnuclear spins (see figure 3 (c)). The electron gas that couples the nuclear spins should\nbe in the quantum Hall regime to avoid Friedel oscillations in the electron density,\nand hence, a rapidly-varying RKKY exchange [59, 60]. To perform computations, it\nis necessary to switch the interaction on and off. In the original work of Privman et\n\n\fRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\n\n9\n\nFigure 3. Schematic diagram illustrating the Fermi contact hyperfine interaction.\nElectron spins are represented by longer arrows and nuclear spins are represented\nby shorter arrows. The electron cloud is indicated with shading. (a) The direct\nexchange interaction is proportional to the electron density at the position of the\nnucleus. The interaction is strong when the electron is close. (b) The interaction is\nweaker when the nuclear spin is far from the centre of the electron wave function. (c)\nWhen two nuclear spins couple to the same (delocalized) electron, an effective exchange\ninteraction between nuclear spins is generated.\n\nal. it was not clear how best to pulse the inter-qubit interaction [24]. Topics such\nas switching error (leakage to states outside of the qubit basis) and perhaps the most\nimportant of all, decoherence, are not addressed in the original work of Privman et al.\nHowever, subsequent studies of the decoherence of nuclear spins in the integer quantum\nHall regime have led to the prediction that the decoherence time for these qubits could\nbe as long as T2 \u2243 10\u22121 s [60, 61].\n2.4. Shallow-donor quantum computing\nFollowing the proposals of Loss-DiVincenzo and Privman et al., Kane [17] has introduced\na proposal that takes advantage of the long lifetimes of nuclear spins (as in the proposal\nof Privman et al.) and electrically-controlled gating of two-qubit interactions (as in\nthe Loss-DiVincenzo proposal). This proposal uses the nuclear spins of 31 P donor\nimpurities in silicon as its qubits. Each donor impurity is associated with a weaklybound electron in an s-type orbital state. One- and two-qubit operations are performed\n\n\fRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\n\n10\n\nwith electrostatic \"A-gates\" and \"J-gates\", respectively. These gates take their names\nfrom the conventional symbols for the contact hyperfine (A) and spin exchange (J)\ncoupling constants. The A-gates adjust the position of the electron cloud relative to\nthe donor nucleus (see figures. 3 (a), (b)). In this way, the magnitude of the contact\nhyperfine interaction is varied, bringing the nuclear spins in and out of resonance with\na uniform applied magnetic field. Two-qubit operations are performed via an electronmediated superexchange between neighbouring nuclear-spin qubits (figure 3 (c)), as in\nthe proposal of Privman et al. The J-gates adjust the overlap of electron clouds on\nneighbouring impurities, thus controlling the strength of the superexchange. Readout\nof the qubits is performed by transferring nuclear spin information back to the electron\nspins and observing the resulting orbital electron wave function via standard capacitive\ntechniques. The original work of Kane includes a discussion of decoherence due to a\nfluctuating gate voltage. This work does not, however, discuss the influence of the\nnuclear dipole-dipole interaction [62], problems associated with a violently positiondependent exchange interaction [63], or decoherence mechanisms that could affect the\nelectron spin during gate operation or measurement. These mechanisms include spinorbit coupling and the contact hyperfine interaction with surrounding nuclear spins.\n2.5. Spin-cluster qubits\nWith the exception of proposals such as the \"exchange-only\" scheme [64], nearly all\nquantum computing architectures require single-qubit operations. Addressing single\nspin-qubits with magnetic resonance pulses usually requires magnetic field gradients\nor g-factor engineering to bring the spins into resonance individually. To implement\ntwo-qubit gates, the spin qubits must typically be separated by very small distances\n(on the order of the electron wave function: \u2243 50 nm in quantum dots, \u2243 10 nm in\nthe proposal of Privman et al., and \u2243 5 nm for an electron bound to a phosphorus\ndonor in silicon). This requirement leads to extremely large magnetic field or g-factor\ngradients, which may not be practical in a typical laboratory setting. To resolve this\nissue, Meier et al. [26] have proposed a scheme for quantum computing based on\nantiferromagnetic spin clusters, rather than single spins. In this proposal the quantum\ncomputer consists of many spin clusters. Each cluster contains an odd number of\nantiferromagnetically exchange-coupled spins. The two basis states of the qubit are\nencoded in the ground-state doublet formed by two total-Sz eigenstates for one cluster.\nSince its basis corresponds to two total spin-Sz eigenstates with an associated magnetic\nmoment, the qubit can be manipulated with a magnetic field to perform single-qubit\noperations in the same way as for a single spin-1/2. Furthermore, the qubit basis\nis protected from higher-lying states by a gap of order \u2206 \u223c J\u03c0 2 /2nc for a cluster\ncontaining nc spins with exchange coupling J [26]. To perform two-qubit operations,\nseparate clusters are coupled at their ends by a tunable exchange. Initialization of the\nqubits is achieved by cooling the system to its ground state in a strong magnetic field,\nas in the Loss-DiVincenzo proposal. Since the two orthogonal states of the ground-state\n\n\fRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\n\n11\n\ndoublet resemble classical N\u00e9el ordering with the magnetization alternating \u2191\u2193\u2191 . . ., or\n\u2193\u2191\u2193 . . ., readout can be performed, in principle, with a local magnetization measurement.\nDecoherence due to magnetic field fluctuations has been considered in this work. There\nis no increase in the decoherence rate (over the single-spin rate) for a magnetic field that\nfluctuates uniformly over the cluster, although there is a linear increase with cluster size\nfor local magnetic fields that fluctuate independently.\n2.6. Quantum computing with molecular magnets\nRecently there has been significant interest in using molecular magnets for quantum\ncomputing applications. These systems exhibit a number of interesting quantummechanical features that can be probed in experiment, including quantum tunnelling\n[65], interference effects [66], and the coherent superposition of high-spin states [67] (for\na review, see reference [68]). Additionally, molecular magnets can be well-understood\nin terms of relatively simple spin Hamiltonians, which means that high-resolution spin\nresonance spectroscopy [69] or specific heat measurements [70] can be used to extract\nthe relevant coupling constants empirically.\nLeuenberger and Loss [71] have introduced a proposal to perform Grover's algorithm\nin ensembles of large-spin molecular magnets. Since this proposal relies only on a\nwell-defined multilevel quantum system with non-equidistant level spacing, the same\nprocedure can be applied to nuclear spins in GaAs in the presence of the nuclear\nquadrupole interaction [72, 73] or to multilevel Josephson junction devices, where\ncoherent oscillations have now been observed [74]. We note that Grover's algorithm\nhas been implemented experimentally using atomic Rydberg states [75]. While these\nproposals and experiments are valuable for demonstrating the practical implementation\nof quantum computation, they rely on single multilevel systems, and are therefore not\nscalable. Finally, the very recent proposal of Troiani et al. [70, 76] suggests using the\nmolecular magnet Cr7 Ni as a real-world implementation of the spin-cluster quantum\ncomputing scheme discussed in the previous section.\n2.7. Silicon valley\nFor quantum computing and spintronics applications, silicon has advantages over other\nsemiconductors. First, silicon has long been a staple for the electronics industry. Second,\nthe spin-orbit interaction in silicon is weak (evidence of this is provided by the small\ndifference in effective electron-spin g-factor from the free value). Third, natural silicon\ncontains only 4.7% nuclear-spin-carrying isotopes, which significantly reduces the effects\nof the contact hyperfine interaction relative to materials such as (Ga/In)As. Silicon\nquantum dots are, however, not as advanced as the alternatives made from III-V\nsemiconductors, and silicon is an indirect gap semiconductor (in contrast to the direct\ngap material GaAs), which limits its use in optical applications. Nevertheless, silicon's\nprevalence in industry means that purification and fabrication techniques are usually\nmore well-established than for other semiconductors.\n\n\fRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\n\n12\n\nLevy [27] has suggested specializing the Loss-DiVincenzo proposal to Ge/Si\nquantum dots. Instead of using top-gates to confine electron spins laterally, these dots\nwould be defined by patterning a ferroelectric material (which has a finite electric dipole\nmoment) on the surface of a 2DEG. In this proposal, two-qubit gating operations would\nbe performed by applying optical excitation to the ferroelectric, which changes the\nlocal electric field that defines neighbouring quantum dots. This change in the local\nelectrostatic potential generates a pulsed exchange interaction between neighbouring\nelectron spins. The electrical pulsing, which defines the rise-time (switching time) \u03c4sw\nfor the exchange coupling occurs at terahertz frequencies (\u03c4sw \u2248 10\u221212 s). This short\ntime scale will likely violate the adiabaticity criterion discussed in section 2.1. To satisfy\nthe adiabaticity criterion, Levy suggests using a third dot to mediate a superexchange\nbetween qubit dots, as in [77].\nLadd et al. [28, 78] have proposed an all-silicon quantum computer, where\nthe qubits are generated from 29 Si nuclear spins embedded in a 28 Si matrix. In a\nsufficiently large magnetic field gradient, provided by a strong Dy ferromagnet, singlequbit operations could be performed with NMR pulses and two-qubit operations could be\nperformed by pulsing the dipole-dipole interaction between neighbouring nuclear spins\n(which would be suppressed in the idle state with an appropriate sequence of NMR\naveraging pulses). Readout in this proposal would be provided by magnetic resonance\nforce microscopy (MRFM) [79, 80], where the nuclear spin state couples to vibrational\nmodes of a cantilever or thin silicon bridge. Recent success in the detection of the\nexistence of a single electron spin with MRFM is very promising, although it has not\nyet been shown experimentally that a single-spin quantum state can be measured using\nthis technique [81] (see also Section 4.6 below for a description of MRFM detection).\nThe recent proposal of Friesen et al. [29] uses electron spins confined to silicon\nquantum dots. This proposal is based on the Loss-DiVincenzo quantum dot quantum\ncomputer, specialized to a silicon environment. Friesen et al. have developed a strategy\nfor initialization and readout via spin-charge conversion, which has been modelled in\ndetail in reference [82]. Two-qubit operations are performed, as in the original LossDiVincenzo proposal, by pulsing a direct exchange between neighbouring electrons using\nelectrostatic gates to increase or decrease the overlap between neighbouring electron\nwave functions. Friesen et al. have performed a detailed calculation of exchange vs.\ngate voltages to find the correct operating regime for their proposed quantum computer.\nIn addition, they consider decoherence due to fluctuations in gate voltage, but do not\naddress other channels of decoherence.\nPerhaps one of the most challenging quantum computing proposals comes from\nStoneham et al. [30, 83, 84]. The qubits of their proposal consist of electron spins bound\nto deep-donor impurities in silicon. Between each pair of qubits, there is a control atom.\nBy optically exciting an electron from the highest valence state of the control atom to a\nmolecular state formed between the deep donors, a superexchange is generated between\nneighbouring qubits, which can be turned off again by stimulated de-excitation. The\nqubits in this proposal are addressed individually by using \"site selectivity\" (every qubit\n\n\fRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\n\n13\n\nhas a unique environment, therefore a unique energy-level structure). Since the energies\ninvolved in the gating process are large, Stoneham et al. suggest that this proposal\ncould potentially operate at room temperature.\n2.8. Hybrid proposals\nIn an attempt to extract the best from both worlds, there have been proposals for hybrid\nquantum computers. These proposals aim to couple ideas from proven approaches to\nquantum computing (cavity QED, trapped ions and trapped atoms) with the benefits\noffered by solid-state implementations.\nImamo\u1e21lu et al. [25] have suggested a scheme that combines cavity-QED and\nspin-based quantum dot quantum computing. The qubits of this proposal are encoded\nin the spin states of quantum dots, as in the Loss-DiVincenzo proposal. The quantum\ndots are contained within a semiconductor microcavity, with well-defined optical modes.\nSingle-qubit operations are performed by addressing individual dots with optical fibres\nand coupling the spin-up and spin-down states via a Raman process, induced by laser\nexcitation. To perform two-qubit operations, distant electron spins are coupled via a\ndelocalized cavity mode. This induces an XY-like interaction between electron spins. In\nthe original work of Imamo\u1e21lu et al., it was shown that an XY-interaction and singlequbit rotations are sufficient to perform a two-qubit CNOT-gate. Single-spin readout\ncould be performed in this proposal by exciting a spin-selective transition in which a\nphoton is emitted (or not emitted) depending on the electron spin state. In this way,\nthe state of the single electron spin is determined by the presence or absence of a single\nphoton.\nQuantum optical proposals and implementations often use the hyperfine (spin) and\nvibrational states of trapped ions and atoms as their qubits. The coupling strengths\nfor these states are typically very small relative to their solid-state counterparts. This\nmeans that decoherence times (T2 ) for these implementations are relatively long (for\nexample, T2 \u2243 170 \u03bcs in reference [85]). For the same reason, however, the relevant\ngating times (\u03c4s ) are also relatively long (\u03c4s \u2243 10 \u03bcs for a CNOT gate in reference\n[85]). The ratio of gating to decoherence time that has been observed r = \u03c4s /T2 \u2248 1/17\ngreatly exceeds current estimates for the error threshold allowable for effective quantum\nerror correction. To remedy this potential difficulty, a very recent proposal by Tian et\nal. [86] suggests a combined quantum optical and solid-state device. In this proposal\nthe states of trapped atoms or ions would be used as a long-lived quantum information\nstorage device during the idle state. When fast one- or two-qubit operations are to\nbe performed, information is transferred to some solid-state device (electron spins in\nquantum dots or superconducting qubits) then returned again to the storage device\nwhen the operation is complete.\n\n\fRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\n\n14\n\n3. Obstacles to quantum dot quantum computing\nSeveral major obstacles to quantum dot quantum computation were identified and\naddressed in the original work of Loss and DiVincenzo [9], and later elaborated upon\n[87, 88, 1]. These obstacles include entanglement (the creation and transport of a\ncoherent superposition of states), gating error (leakage to higher states outside of\nthe qubit basis during gate operation), and perhaps most importantly, coherence (the\npreservation of any given superposition in the presence of a coupling to the environment).\nIn the rest of this section we review work that has been done to understand and possibly\nsurmount these three obstacles in the context of the Loss-DiVincenzo proposal.\n3.1. Flying qubits and entanglement generation\nIn addition to the five DiVincenzo criteria for quantum computation introduced in\nsection 1, there are two \"desiderata\", which are important for performing quantum\ncommunication tasks. These desiderata, which were addressed in [87], are summarized\nin the following statements [22]:\n(vi) The ability to inter-convert stationary and flying qubits.\n(vii) The ability to faithfully transmit flying qubits between distant locations.\nThe whimsical term \"flying qubits\" refers to qubits that can be conveniently moved\nfrom place to place. The most obvious (and common) choice for a flying qubit is\nprovided by the polarization states of photons [32]. In the context of quantum-dot\nquantum computing, this has led to a number of proposals for the conversion of quantum\ninformation [25, 89, 90, 91, 92] or entanglement [93] from spin to light, and vice versa.\nMore recent work has suggested that \"free electron quantum computation\" may be\npossible in principle [94, 95], in which mobile electrons (in some material) travelling\nbetween dots could replace photons as the flying qubit medium of choice.\nDeeply connected to the implementation of flying qubits is the creation of nonlocal\nentanglement. The race to create and measure [87, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100] entangled\nparticle pairs has led to a virtual industry of so-called \"entangler\" proposals for the\nspin [87, 96, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 89, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113] and\norbital [114, 115, 116] degrees of freedom. These proposals have the very ambitious\ngoal of generating and spatially separating a many-particle quantum superposition\nthat can not be factorized into single-particle states. The canonical example of such\na state for the spin degree of freedom is the singlet formed from two spin-1/2 particles:\n\u221a\n(|\u2191\u2193i \u2212 |\u2193\u2191i)/ 2. The various efforts related to spin entanglement include proposals to\nextract and separate spin-singlet pairs from a superconductor through two quantum dots\n[102] or Luttinger-liquid leads [108, 109] and proposals that generate entanglement near\na magnetic impurity [105], through a single dot [106], from biexcitons in double quantum\ndots [89], through a triple dot [110], and from Coulomb scattering in a two-dimensional\nelectron gas [113]. Entanglement generation and measurement remains a lofty goal\n\n\fRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\n\n15\n\nfor those working on solid-state quantum computing, theorists and experimentalists\nalike. Recent experiments [117] that have measured the concurrence (an entanglement\nmeasure) for electrons in the ground state of a two-electron quantum dot point to a\npromising future for entanglement-related phenomena in the solid state (see also section\n5.3). For recent reviews on entanglement generation and measurement, see references\n[118, 119].\n3.2. Gating error\nHu and Das Sarma have evaluated the probability for double-occupancy of one of\nthe dots in the Loss-DiVincenzo proposal using Hartree-Fock and molecular orbital\ntechniques [120]. They suggest that it may be difficult to achieve both a significant\nexchange coupling and low double-occupancy probability. Schliemann et al. [40, 41] and\nmore recently Requist et al. [42] have investigated the probability for double-occupancy\ngating errors in a pair of coupled quantum dots during swap gate operation. Through\nnumerical and analytical study they have found that the Loss-DiVincenzo proposal is\nvery robust against double-occupancy errors when operated in the adiabatic regime\n(defined in section 2.1). Barrett and Barnes [121] have subsequently shown that orbital\ndephasing can result in a significant error rate (10\u22122\u201310\u22123 errors per gate operation).\nThis is comparable to current estimates for the maximum error rate allowable for\nquantum error correction to be effective [122], but further studies on the nature of\nthe spin-orbit interaction have suggested that the spin-orbit coupling can be minimized\nwith careful pulsing of the exchange during gate operations (see section 3.3.1). When\nthe potential barrier between quantum dots is pulsed low, the overlap between nearestneighbour dots is appreciable, while that between next-nearest and next-next-nearest\nneighbours is exponentially suppressed with distance. In spite of the smallness of these\ninteractions, Mizel and Lidar [123] have recently suggested that three- and four-spin\ninteractions in a realistic quantum computing proposal may lead to substantial gating\nerrors. These problems are, however, specific to a particular architecture, and it is\npossible that they could be corrected or exploited by adjusting the device design [123].\n3.3. Decoherence\nEvery experimental apparatus shows some small fluctuations in electrostatic voltage\nand applied magnetic field. These fluctuations, acting on an electron spin in a quantum\ndot, will inevitably induce decay of the spin directly through the Zeeman interaction (in\nthe case of a fluctuating magnetic field), or indirectly through spin-orbit coupling (in\nthe case of a fluctuating electric field). The effect of these fluctuations can be treated\naccurately (for a weak coupling to the electron spin) by the phenomenological spin-boson\nmodel within a Born-Markov approximation, as derived in reference [9]. The coupling\nof the electron spin to the bath cannot always be treated as weak, and effects of the\nbath memory (non-Markovian evolution) may be important for achieving the level of\naccuracy required to perform quantum error correction. For these reasons, the solution\n\n\f16\n\nRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n\nSymbol\nDescription\n~\u03c90\nSize-quantization energy\nJ\nElectron spin exchange coupling\n~ max{|\u03b1|, |\u03b2|}/l\nSpin-orbit coupling strength\nA\nHyperfine interaction (polarized nuclei)\n\u221a\nA/ N\nHyperfine interaction (unpolarized nuclei)\nA/N\nKnight shift dispersion\n3\nN\u03bcB \u03bcN /l\nElectron-nuclear dipolar coupling\n~/\u03c4dd\nNuclear-nuclear dipolar coupling\n2 3\n\u03bcB /l\nElectron-electron dipolar coupling\n\nEstimate\n1 meV\n10\u22121 meV\n10\u22122 meV\n10\u22121 meV\n10\u22124 meV\n10\u22126 meV\n10\u22127 meV\n10\u22128 meV\n10\u22129 meV\n\nreference\n[88]\n[88]\n[126]\n[127]\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n[127]\n\u2013\n\nTable 1. Relevant energy scales for the Loss-DiVincenzo quantum computing\nproposal. The above estimates are based on a GaAs dot of lateral size l = 30 nm\ncontaining N = 105 nuclear spins. The typical size-quantization energy ~\u03c90 and\nexchange coupling J for a dot of this size are taken from reference [88]. The Rashba\n(\u03b1) and Dresselhaus (\u03b2) coefficients were extracted from experimental data in reference\n[126]. The hyperfine interaction constant A was estimated from a weighted average\nover the hyperfine coupling constants for the three nuclear spin species in GaAs in\nreference [127]. The nuclear spin dipolar coupling is estimated from the linewidth of\nthe NMR resonance in [127], which gives a correlation time \u03c4dd \u2248 10\u22124 s.\n\nto this model has recently been extended to obtain non-Markovian effects [124] and\ncorrections beyond the Born approximation [125] in the case of ohmic dissipation in the\nbath.\nFluctuations in voltage and magnetic field are artifacts of a given experimental\napparatus. In principle, these fluctuations can be reduced with improved electronics,\nand can therefore be regarded as extrinsic sources of decoherence. In addition to\nthese extrinsic sources, there are sources of decoherence that are intrinsic to the\nquantum dot qubit design. These include the coupling of the electronic spin to\nphonons in the surrounding lattice or other fluctuations via the spin-orbit interaction\n[128, 88, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134] and coupling of the electron spin to surrounding\nnuclear spins via the contact hyperfine interaction [88, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140,\n141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149]. A detailed understanding of the electron\nspin evolution under the influence of these interactions is of fundamental interest and\nis necessary to implement reliable quantum dot quantum computation. The first step\nto understanding any decoherence mechanism is to estimate its size. In table 1 we give\nestimates for various energy scales related to decoherence and qubit operation in the\nLoss-DiVincenzo proposal.\n3.3.1. Spin-orbit coupling We would like to assess the spin-orbit coupling strength for\ntypical quantum dots. Performing the standard non-relativistic expansion and reduction\nto a two-component spinor for a Dirac electron to leading order in 1/mc2 leads to the\n\n\fRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\n\n17\n\nspin-orbit coupling term [150]\n~\n(\u2207V (r) \u00d7 P) * S.\n(2)\n2m2 c2\nIn the above, m is the electron mass, c is the speed of light, V (r) is the potential\nexperienced by the electron, P is the momentum operator in three dimensions, and\nS is the electron spin-1/2 operator. For a spherically symmetric parabolic confining\npotential, V (r) = m\u03c902 r 2 /2, the spin-orbit coupling term is Hso = (\u03c902/2mc2 )L * S.\nHere, L = r \u00d7 P is the orbital angular momentum operator, which can be substituted\nwith ~ for estimation purposes. Comparing the strength of this coupling to the orbital\nenergy ~\u03c90 \u2248 1 meV gives hHso i /~\u03c90 \u2248 10\u22127 [128, 88]. This smallness of the spin-orbit\ncoupling compared to the orbital energy scale would suggest that the electron spin in\nquantum dots is relatively free from external influences that couple to its charge. In\nrealistic dots, however, the confining potential is neither smooth (it has a 1/r singularity\nat the centre of each lattice ion), nor spherically symmetric, and the resulting spinorbit interaction takes-on a more complicated form. In a crystalline solid, the spinorbit interaction is the sum of structure inversion asymmetry (Rashba) [151] and bulk\ninversion asymmetry (Dresselhaus) [152] terms, which can be written for an electron\nconfined to two dimensions as\n\u0001\nHso = \u03b1(px \u03c3y \u2212 py \u03c3x ) + \u03b2(\u2212px \u03c3x + py \u03c3y ) + O |p|3 .\n(3)\nHso =\n\n\u03b1 (\u03b2) is the Rashba (Dresselhaus) coefficient, p = (px , py ) is the electron momentum\noperator in the x-y plane, and \u03c3x,y are the usual Pauli matrices. For a strongly twodimensional system, the cubic Dresselhaus term, of order \u223c |p|3 , can be neglected\nrelative to the Rashba and linear Dresselhaus terms, which have the size \u223c px,y p2z [153].\nIn a two-dimensional quantum dot, we replace pz \u2248 ~/d, px,y \u2248 ~/l, where d is the\n2DEG thickness and l is the lateral quantum dot size. The cubic term is then smaller\nthan the linear Dresselhaus and Rashba terms by a factor of order \u223c (d/l)2 . The Rashba\nand Dresselhaus coefficients have been extracted from magnetoresistance data in a\nGaAs/AlGaAs 2DEG. This gives the values ~\u03b2 = (4\u00b11) meV-\u00c5 and ~\u03b1 = (\u22125\u00b11) meV\u00c5 [126]. To estimate the size of Hso given in (3) for a quantum dot containing a single\nelectron, we replace the momenta by px,y \u2248 ~/l, where l = 10\u2013100 nm. This gives\nthe range hHso i = 10\u22122 \u201310\u22121 meV. This estimate is significantly larger than the value\n(\u2243 10\u22127 meV) for a simple parabolic confining potential. All is not lost, however, since\nthe spin-orbit coupling can only affect the spin indirectly through fluctuations in the\norbital degree of freedom. We can only assess the real danger of this interaction through\na correct microscopic analysis of the spin-orbit Hamiltonian in the proper context.\nThe direct effects that a realistic spin-orbit interaction has on two-qubit gating\noperations in a quantum computer have been explored by several authors. Bonesteel et\nal. [154] have shown that the effect of the spin-orbit interaction on coupled quantum\ndot qubits can be minimized by using time-symmetric qubit gating. Subsequently,\nBurkard and Loss [155] have shown that the spin-orbit effect during gating can be\neliminated completely for appropriately chosen exchange pulse shapes (see also reference\n\n\fRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\n\n18\n\n[156]). Additionally, there have been several investigations into the possible spin-flip\n(relaxation) [129, 130, 131, 132, 133] and decoherence [157, 134] mechanisms mediated\nby the spin-orbit interaction and coupling to lattice phonons or other fluctuations. In\nmany ways, an electron in the orbital ground state of a quantum dot is very similar to\nan electron bound to a donor impurity site. Since the spin relaxation and decoherence\ntimes for electrons bound to shallow donors have been investigated many years ago\n[158, 159], much of this work has been used to accelerate progress for the analogous\nquantum dot structures.\nKhaetskii and Nazarov have calculated the rates for spin-flip transitions due to\nthe spin-orbit interaction both through direct relaxation from an excited orbital state\naccompanied by a spin flip [129], and through a virtual process between the two states\nof a Zeeman-split doublet within the same orbital state [130]. The most effective\nspin-flip mechanism for a transition between Zeeman-split states, which has a rate\n1/T1 \u221d (g\u03bcB B)5 /(~\u03c90 )4 , is significantly reduced for decreasing magnetic field B and\nincreasing orbital energy ~\u03c90 .\nIn the presence of spin-orbit coupling, a precessing spin induces an oscillating\nelectric field. Levitov and Rashba [131] have suggested that this coupling may be a\ndouble-edged sword in view of applications to spintronics. On the positive side, the\ntime-varying electric field might provide access to the dynamics of a single isolated spin.\nThe reverse mechanism, however, leads to a further channel for spin relaxation from\nexcitations in the dot leads.\nThere have been further studies of spin-lattice relaxation mechanisms that are\nspecialized to particular quantum dot architectures. Glavin and Kim [132] have\ncompared results for Si quantum dots and donor impurities, and Cheng et al. [133] have\nperformed a numerical exact-diagonalization study for GaAs quantum dots, extending\nthe validity of previous calculations to a more realistic set of wave functions.\nThe spin-flip (relaxation) time T1 is important for applications of spintronics\ninvolving classical information, encoded in the states |\u2191i and |\u2193i. However, for quantum\ncomputing tasks, the relevant time scale is the spin decoherence time T2 , which is the\nlifetime for a coherent superposition a |\u2191i + b |\u2193i. Typically, the decoherence time is\nmuch less than the relaxation time (T2 \u226a T1 ). Golovach et al. have shown that the\nfluctuations induced from spin-orbit coupling are purely transverse to the direction of an\napplied magnetic field to leading order in the coupling [134]. Because the fluctuations\nare purely transverse, the corresponding T2 time due to the combined spin-orbit and\nelectron-phonon interactions exceeds the value of the longitudinal spin relaxation time,\ngiving T2 = 2T1 . Moreover, for phonons in three dimensions, the spectral function is\nsuper-ohmic (\u223c \u03c9 3 ) and thus the pure dephasing contribution is absent, again ensuring\nthat T2 = 2T1 . Provided other decoherence mechanisms can be arbitrarily suppressed,\nthis result is very promising for applications of quantum dot quantum computing in\nview of recent experiments that show exceptionally long T1 times for single electron\nspins confined to GaAs quantum dots (see section 4.3).\n\n\fRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\n\n19\n\n3.3.2. Spin-spin coupling Unfortunately, the spin-orbit interaction is not the end of the\ndecoherence story. The electron spin can also couple directly to other spins embedded\nin the quantum computer device. In a GaAs quantum dot, the electron wave function\ncontains approximately N = 105 lattice nuclei, and every nucleus carries spin I = 3/2.\nThe dominant spin-spin coupling for this type of dot arises from the Fermi contact\nhyperfine interaction. The Fermi contact hyperfine interaction for an electron with\norbital envelope wave function \u03c8(r) and spin operator S interacting with surrounding\nnuclear spins Ik is described by the spin Hamiltonian\nX\nHhf =\nAk S * Ik ;\nAk = v0 A|\u03c8(rk )|2 .\n(4)\nk\n\nHere, v0 is the volume of a crystal unit cell containing one nuclear spin. Due to Hhf , the\nelectron spin will experience an effective magnetic field (the Overhauser field ), which\ngives rise to an energy splitting on the order of pIA, where I is the total nuclear spin\nand p is the nuclear spin polarization. For full polarization of the nuclear spin system,\n\u22121\nthe Overhauser field induces a splitting\ntypical\n\u221a In a \u22124\n\u221a \u2248 IA = 10 meV in GaAs.\nunpolarized sample, we have |p| \u2248 1/ N , which gives a splitting IA/ N \u2248 10 meV\nfor a quantum dot containing N = 105 nuclear spins. In addition, the nuclear spin at\nsite k will experience an effective Zeeman splitting (Knight shift) on the order of Ak .\nSince the coupling constants Ak vary in space from Ak \u2248 A/N = 10\u22126 meV near the\ndot centre to Ak = 0 far from the dot, nuclear spins at different sites will precess with\ndifferent frequencies. This dispersion in the Knight shift will efficiently destroy collective\nstates generated in the nuclear spin system on a time scale t \u2248 ~N/A \u2248 1 \u03bcs [160], and\nis therefore important for proposals based on nuclear spin quantum computing.\nIn addition to the Fermi contact hyperfine term, there is an anisotropic contribution\nto the hyperfine interaction. For a widely separated electron and nucleus, the anisotropic\nhyperfine interaction reduces to the interaction energy between point dipoles:\n\u001b\nX (g\u03bcB )(gI \u03bcN ) \u001a 3(Ik * r)(S * r)\nHdd =\n\u2212 Ik * S .\n(5)\nr3\nr2\nk\nFor a microscopic derivation of Hhf and Hdd , see reference [161]. If the electron spin\nis in a spherically symmetric orbital s-state with the nuclear spin at its centre, the\nanisotropic hyperfine interaction vanishes identically [161]. The contribution of this\nterm from nuclear spins near the dot centre will therefore be small, but for nuclear spins\nnear the edge of the electron wave function, which do not \"see\" a spherical electron spin\ndistribution, it may become appreciable. Assuming approximately N = 105 nuclear\nspins have a significant dipolar coupling to the electron, we estimate the size of the\nelectron-nuclear dipolar interaction as hHdd i \u2248 N\u03bcN \u03bcB /l3 \u2243 10\u22127 meV, where l = 30 nm\nis the typical dot size.\nThe final spin-spin coupling directly associated with the electron is the magnetic\ndipolar coupling of the electron to other electron spins in neighbouring quantum dots.\nThis can be estimated as \u03bc2B /l3 \u2248 10\u22129 meV. Although this coupling is very weak\nfor neighbouring single-electron quantum dots, it can become significant at atomic\n\n\fRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\n\n20\n\nlength scales, and may be a significant source of decoherence for other solid-state\nproposals [26]. In addition to direct electron spin coupling mechanisms, there are also\nsignificant mechanisms that couple the environment to itself. For example, the nuclear\nspins experience a mutual dipolar coupling. This dipolar coupling causes the nuclear\nenvironment to evolve dynamically, which can, in turn, affect the electron through\ndirect hyperfine coupling. The nuclear spins evolve on a time scale given by the dipolar\ncorrelation time \u03c4dd = 10\u22124 s. The time \u03c4dd is determined from the linewidth of the\nNMR resonance (in bulk) through ~/\u03c4dd \u2243 10\u22128 meV [127].\nThere have been many studies of electron spin dynamics in the presence of the\nstrongest (Fermi contact hyperfine) spin-spin interaction. Burkard et al. [88] showed\nthat in the presence of the hyperfine interaction with surrounding nuclear spins, the\nelectron spin-flip transition probability could be suppressed by applying a magnetic\nfield B or polarizing the nuclear spin system (this probability is suppressed by the\nfactor 1/p2 N for B = 0, nuclear spin polarization p and N nuclear spins within the\nquantum dot). Erlingsson et al. have investigated singlet-triplet transitions mediated by\nthe contact hyperfine interaction [135] and transitions between a Zeeman-split doublet\n[136]. In an investigation of decoherence, Khaetskii et al. [137, 138] have found an exact\nsolution for the electron spin evolution under the action of Hhf in the particular case of a\nfully-polarized nuclear spin system. They found that only a small fraction (\u2243 1/N) of the\nelectron spin underwent decay and the resulting dynamics were described by a power-law\nor inverse logarithmic decay at long times. Schliemann et al. [139] have performed exact\ndiagonalizations on small nuclear spin systems. These exact diagonalization studies\nshow that the hyperfine interaction can be very efficient in causing decay of the electron\nspin in small systems and that the dynamics of an ensemble are reproduced by the\ndynamics of a randomly correlated initial nuclear spin state. Yuzbashyan et al. [149]\nhave recently found an exact closed-form solution for the classical (mean-field) analogue\nof this problem and highlighted its connection to the dynamics of the BCS pairing\nmodel.\nThe gating operations performed on a quantum computer are performed on single\nisolated systems. This raises the question of whether ensemble or pure-state initial\nconditions should be used when calculating spin dynamics for the purpose of quantum\ncomputing. The free-induction decay of the electron spin in the presence of an ensemble\nof nuclear spin configurations has been investigated by Merkulov et al. [140], who found\na rapid initial Gaussian decay of the electron spin with a time scale \u03c4 \u2248 1 ns in GaAs.\nEven for a single quantum mechanical initial state of the nuclear system, the electronspin free-induction decay can be severe. For a translationally-invariant direct-product\nnuclear spin state with polarization p, and in the limit of a large number N \u226b 1 of\nnuclear spins I = 1/2, and large magnetic field |g\u03bcB B| \u226b A, the transverse electron\nspin hS+ it = hSx it + i hSy it decays like a Gaussian [145] (up to a time-dependent phase\n\n\f21\n\nRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\nfactor):\n2\n\u2212 t2\n2\u03c4c\n\nhS+ it \u221d hS+ i0 e\n\n;\n\n\u03c4c =\n\ns\n\nN 2~\n.\n1 \u2212 p2 A\n\n(6)\n\nIn GaAs, and for polarization p \u2248 0, we have \u03c4c \u2248 5 ns. The time scale \u03c4c can\nbe moderately extended by polarizing the nuclear spin system. However, even a\npolarization degree of 99% (the current record in a GaAs quantum dot is 60% [162],\nand significant gate-controlled nuclear spin polarization has been seen in a GaAs 2DEG\nin the quantum Hall regime [163]) would only extend the decay time by a factor of\n10. If the state of the nuclear spins could be prepared, e.g., via a measurement, in\nan eigenstate of the total z-component of the nuclear Overhauser field, the decay in\n(6) would be removed. Under these conditions, the electron spin still undergoes a\nnontrivial non-Markovian (history dependent) dynamics on a time scale given by the\ninverse Knight shift dispersion ~N/A \u2248 1\u03bcs. This decay can be evaluated in the presence\nof a sufficiently large magnetic field [145].\nAn alternative way to remove the effects of the decay in (6) is to perform a spinecho sequence on the electron [145]. The decay of the Hahn spin-echo envelope due to\nspectral diffusion (which includes the effect of the nuclear dipole-dipole interaction) has\nbeen investigated by de Sousa et al. [141, 142] for a model with fluctuating classical\nnuclear spins I = 1/2, that evolve in a Markovian fashion. This same model has recently\nbeen extended to larger nuclear spin I > 1/2 [146].\nIn addition to work on the time-dependent evolution of a localized electron\nspin, there have been proposals for spintronic devices that use the contact hyperfine\ninteraction to their advantage. These include a proposal for dynamic polarization of\nnuclear spins via optical manipulation of localized electrons [164] and a proposal for\na nuclear spin quantum memory [165, 166, 167] that takes advantage of potentially\nlong-lived nuclear states. The quantum memory proposal is limited by the Knight shift\ndispersion in quantum dots in the presence of an electron spin [160]. The electron\nmust therefore be removed from the dot after transferring quantum information to the\nnuclear spin. In this case, the nuclear spin state may live as long as the nuclear spin\ndipole-dipole correlation time \u03c4dd \u2248 10\u22124 s (in GaAs) or possibly longer if, for example,\nso-called WaHuHa NMR pulses are applied to suppress the dipole-dipole interaction\n[167].\n\n\fRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\n\n22\n\n4. Experimental achievements\nIn this section we present a selection of important experimental achievements leading\ntowards the implementation of quantum information processing using electron spins in\nquantum dots.\n4.1. Single and coupled quantum dots\nWe first discuss different experimental approaches to construct semiconductor quantum\ndot structures that enable control over the spin degree of freedom on the level of a single\nelectron. The precise control of the number of excess electrons in a quantum dot is a\nnecessary prerequisite to achieve control over the spin states of interest. The addition\nof an electron from the surrounding material to a negatively charged dot requires the\ncharging energy \u03b4\u01ebc to overcome the electrostatic energy of other electrons in the dot.\nThe charging energy \u03b4\u01ebc depends on the number N of charges confined in the dot. The\nregime (gate voltages) where the injection of additional electrons into the dot is blocked\ndue to \u03b4\u01ebc is known as the Coulomb blockade regime (see figure 4). In recent years,\na great deal of experimental effort has focused on the single-electron regime (N = 1)\n\nFigure 4.

There are several possibilities to produce quantum\ndot structures capable of confining single electrons. The list of ingenious quantum dot\nproduction techniques has grown enormously during the last years. Instead of presenting\na complete list thereof, we rather focus on a few techniques that have paved the way\nfor the first steps towards the implementation of quantum information processing using\nspin states.\nAs already mentioned in section 2.1, quantum dots can be created by electrical\ngating of a 2DEG via lithographically defined gate electrodes (see figures 1, 2, 5, and\n6). Applying a negative voltage to the gates depletes the 2DEG underneath them, such\nthat quantum dots are formed in the regions surrounded by the gates. Electrically\ngated dots are typically characterized by an electron level spacing \u03b4\u01eb \u2248 0.1 . . . 2 meV,\na charging energy \u03b4\u01ebc \u2248 1 . . . 2 meV, and a dot diameter l \u2248 10 . . . 1000 nm [170, 171].\nTypical materials for such dots include GaAs, InSb, and Si. Control of the coupling of\nelectrically gated GaAs quantum dots has been demonstrated and investigated in-depth\nin transport experiments [171, 172, 173].\nAs an alternative to electrical gating, etching techniques [174] can also be applied\nto achieve lateral confinement in the plane of a 2DEG. For example, Tarucha et al.\n[175] have produced gated vertical quantum dots by etching a pillar structure which\n\n\fRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\n\n24\n\nFigure 6.

Usually, molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is used for the\ngrowth of such systems. If the MBE growth process is performed without interruption,\nsuch steps occur at random positions as natural fluctuations of the quantum well width.\nQuantum dots of this type possess excellent optical properties, including very sharp\noptical linewidths. This has allowed the coherent control of optically excited states in\nexperiments [178, 179] and has recently culminated in the implementation of a crot\ngate for qubits which are defined by the presence or absence of an exciton in the quantum\ndot [180].\nFurther, quantum dot structures can be grown by self-assembly, e.g., using the\nStranski-Krastanov growth technique. In this technique, self-assembled dot islands form\nspontaneously during epitaxial growth due to a lattice mismatch between the dot and\nthe substrate material [181]. Typical sets of dot/substrate materials are InAs/GaAs,\nGe/Si(100), GaN/AlN, InP/GaInP, and CdSe/ZnSe [182]. The electron level spacing of\nthis type of dot is typically \u03b4\u01eb \u2248 30 . . . 50 meV with a charging energy \u03b4\u01ebc \u2248 20 meV,\n\n\fRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\n\n25\n\nFigure 7.

Small selfassembled dots typically have a pyramidal shape with four facets, whereas larger dots\n(containing, e.g., 7 monolayers of InAs) form multi-faceted domes [182]. If pyramidal\nself-assembled dots are covered with a thin layer of the substrate material (called the\ncapping layer), the capped dots take-on an elliptical (or rarely, even a circular) shape.\nAdditionally, these dots exert strain on the capping layer. If quantum dots are grown\non the capping layer, they tend to grow on the strain field on top of the capped dots\nrather than at random positions. This enables the growth of vertically coupled quantum\ndots, where the thin capping layer acts as a barrier between the two dots (see figure\n8 (b)). A typical difficulty related to Stranski-Krastanov self-assembled dots is the\nintrinsic randomness of the growth process, as shown in figure 8 (a). Yet, prepatterning\nof the substrate has been shown to be a way to achieve a well-defined growth position\nof the first dot layer [184] (see figure 8 (c)), paving the way to site-controlled arrays\nof single or coupled dots [185]. Cleaved-edge overgrowth is an alternative technique\nenabling atomically precise control of the growth site of single and coupled dots [186].\nColloidal chemistry is yet another promising approach to assemble quantum dots with\nwell-controlled size and shape [187].

Charge and spin control in quantum dots\nPrecise control over the number of confined electrons has been demonstrated several\nyears ago in InGaAs self-assembled dots [190], in gated vertical quantum dots [175],\nin quantum rings [191], and also in electrostatically defined single [192] and double\n[193, 194, 195] dots in GaAs. The single-electron states of quantum dots in the\nlow-energy range have been shown to be in agreement with a shell model. Because\nthe quantum dot confinement is much stronger along the growth direction than\nperpendicular to it (for dots defined in a 2DEG as well as for self-assembled dots),\nthe dot potential is effectively two-dimensional. The low-lying confined electron states\ncan be well-approximated by the states of a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator [175].\nThus, the single-particle ground state has s symmetry and the first excited shell has p\n\n\f27\n\nRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\n\n(a)\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n(e)\n\nFigure 9.

A static\nmagnetic field splits the spin states of the quantum dot due to the Zeeman interaction.\nFor suitable gate voltages applied to the dot, the level configurations shown in (a) and\n(b) can be observed.

If an external magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the quantum dot\nplane, new harmonic oscillator states (Fock-Darwin states) are the exact eigenfunctions\n[196], with a frequency that increases with the magnetic field. Recently, Raymond et\nal. [197] have observed the Fock-Darwin spectrum also for excitons (electron-hole pairs,\nrather than electrons alone) in quantum dots.\nThe degeneracy of the two spin states | \u2191i and | \u2193i is lifted in the presence of a\nmagnetic field due to the Zeeman interaction. This makes the two states energetically\ndistinguishable (see figure 9). The precise control of the occupation number of electrons\n\n\fRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\n\n28\n\nin single and double quantum dots has enabled experiments on single spins in quantum\ndots, as we discuss in the following.\n4.3. Spin relaxation\nRecently, expectations for the stability of spin qubits in quantum dots have grown\nconsiderably as progressively longer spin lifetimes have been reported. A series of works\non electron spin relaxation in quantum dots started with Fujisawa et al. [198] who\nreported a triplet-to-singlet relaxation time of \u03c4S\u2212T = 200 \u03bcs in vertical quantum dots.\nMore recently, a lower bound on the singlet-triplet relaxation time has been measured\nin lateral dots, giving \u03c4S\u2212T \u2265 70 \u03bcs [199]. Very quickly thereafter, a substantially longer\nrelaxation time (\u03c4S\u2212T = (2.58 \u00b1 0.09) ms) was measured independently using a novel\nspin readout technique [200]. Several groups have since measured T1 for single electron\nspins. For electrostatically-defined GaAs dots, Hanson et al. [201] have reported a lower\nbound T1 & 50 \u03bcs at a magnetic field of B = 7.5 T which was subsequently topped by\nElzerman et al. [202], with T1 \u2248 (0.85 \u00b1 0.11) ms at B = 8 T. In these experiments, a\ntwo-level pulse technique for the quantum dot gate voltage has been applied to inject\nan electron into the dot and to extract it later. In a certain parameter range, the\nZeeman splitting of the two spin states is sufficient that tunnelling into or out of the\ndot is not possible for one of the two spin states [203, 192, 198, 201] (see also figure 9).\nThis enables spin detection via the detection of charge in the quantum dot, which has\nbeen realized through an adjacent quantum point contact (QPC) [169, 193, 201, 202]\n(in a setup similar to that shown in figure 5 (a) for a double quantum dot). In these\nexperiments, the QPC has been tuned via a gate voltage to a conductance G \u2248 e2 /h,\nwhere the modulation of the current IQPC through the QPC has maximum sensitivity\nto changes in the electrostatic environment, including the number of charges in the\nquantum dot. Recently, Kroutvar et al. [204] established a lower bound T1 & 20 ms at\nT = 1 K and B = 4 T for In(Ga)As self-assembled dots. In this experiment, an optical\ncharge storage device has been excited with circularly polarized laser excitation. The\nlarger level spacing of self-assembled dots (compared to gated GaAs dots) is responsible\nfor the longer T1 -time seen in this experiment which is limited by spin-orbit coupling\n(see also section 3.3.1).\n4.4. Spin decoherence\nThe spin coherence of electrons localized at impurity centres has been investigated\ndeeply for the last few decades in ensemble measurements. Many of these experiments\nhave investigated the spin dephasing of electrons bound by the Coulomb interaction to\na donor in silicon (for example, phosphorus, antimony, or arsenic). The wavefunction of\nsuch donor-bound electrons is quite similar to the wavefunction of electrons bound in a\nquantum dot. Several of these experiments have demonstrated rather long electron spin\ndecoherence times, which is mainly due to the confinement of the electrons in all three\nspatial dimensions (leading to a \u03b4-peaked density of states). The electron nuclear double\n\n\fRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\n\n29\n\nresonance (ENDOR) method has been applied to map-out the wave function of the\nbound electron [205]. Hahn-echo measurements have shown that T2 \u2248 10\u22124 s for donor\nelectron spins in phosphorus-doped silicon (Si:P) [206]. Recent spin-echo measurements\nof isotopically purified 28 Si:P have shown that T2 = 62 ms [207]. This very long T2 -time\nis possible in such systems since 28 Si has nuclear spin I = 0, drastically reducing the\nhyperfine interaction. In contrast, spin-echo measurements of electron spins bound to\n29\nSi:P donors in isotopically purified 29 Si have shown a much shorter envelope decay\ntime (essentially T2 ) on the order of TM \u2248 10\u22125 s [208].\nTo our knowledge, there are only very few results published on measurements of\nthe T2 time of single electron spins in quantum dots. Still, optical experiments probing\nthe decoherence time of exciton spins may provide a lower bound for the T2 -time of\nsingle electrons. Gupta et al. [209] have measured a lower bound for the ensemble\ndephasing time of T2\u2217 \u2248 3 ns for CdSe dots using femtosecond-resolved Faraday rotation.\nIn this experiment, different decay time scales have been observed for the spin precession,\nshowing a more complicated dynamics than expected. Recent g-factor calculations\nfor electrons and holes in CdSe dots, based on time-dependent empirical tight-binding\ntheory, addressed this issue [210]. A strongly anisotropic g-factor, with gx \u2248 gy > gz for\nall dot sizes (where z denotes the c-axis of the wurtzite crystal) has been obtained for\nthe electron. The range of g-factors (for the corresponding dot sizes) is in agreement\nwith the experimentally [209] extracted pairs of g-factors, providing a first step in the\nunderstanding of the observed nontrivial dynamics of electron and hole spins in quantum\ndots. Measuring the Hanle effect in an ensemble of InAs self-assembled dots, Epstein et\nal. [211] obtained ge T2\u2217 \u2248 210ps at T = 6K, where ge is the electron g-factor. In contrast\nto the single-spin decoherence time T2 , the ensemble dephasing time T2\u2217 might be reduced\nfrom T2\u2217 = T2 by dephasing among the spins of the measured ensemble. Further, the\nelectron-hole exchange interaction couples electron and hole spins in experiments that\ninvolve excitons. It can be assumed that this coupling further influenced the decay of\nthe observed luminescence polarization. It might thus be possible that the coherence of\nsingle electron spins is larger than the values obtained from these experiments. In fact,\nrecent Hanle measurements on individual quantum dots [162] have indicated an electron\ndecoherence time\n\u221a T2 \u2248 16 ns. Yet, this result may have slightly exceeded the expected\nvalue T2 \u2248 ~ N /A, discussed in section 3.3.2. The quantum dots in this experiment\nwere defined by monolayer-high steps at the interfaces of a 3 nm thick GaAs/AlGaAs\nquantum well.\nIn section 5, we discuss further proposals to measure the T2 -time of a single electron\nspin in a quantum dot. Given the measured T1 values in the millisecond range and\nmeasured T2 times that are far smaller, it can be expected that nuclear spins are typically\nthe dominant source of decoherence for electron spins in quantum dots.\n\n\fRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\n\n30\n\n4.5. Spin initialization\nTo initialize the spin qubits, a strong polarization can be achieved by applying a\nstrong magnetic field B, such that the Zeeman splitting is larger than the thermal\nenergy, as already mentioned in section 2.1. Further, electrons with parallel spins can\nalso be injected via spin-polarized currents. The injection of spins from ferromagnetic\nsemiconductors into normal semiconductors have been reported with polarizations up\nto 90% [7, 8]. Initialization as well as detection of a single spin can also be achieved\nusing a spin filter (see section 4.6) or by optical schemes (see section 4.9).\n4.6. Single-spin detection\nA central question for the readout of a single spin is the reliability of the experimental\nresult. We briefly address this issue here. Errors during the measurement process\ncan be eliminated statistically by performing an experiment n times identically. This\nprocedure is called n-shot readout. There is a probability p that the experimental\nreadout procedure of a certain quantum mechanical state yields the correct result, and\na probability 1 \u2212 p that it does not. In this way, one can define the probabilities p\u2191 and\np\u2193 for the measurement successes of the states of a spin-1/2. Including the possibility\nof an error, the measurement of the state of a spin-1/2 is described by a measurement\nof the observables\nA\u2191 = p\u2191 | \u2191ih\u2191 | + (1 \u2212 p\u2193 )| \u2193ih\u2193 |,\n\nA\u2193 = p\u2193 | \u2193ih\u2193 | + (1 \u2212 p\u2191 )| \u2191ih\u2191 |,\n\n(7)\n(8)\n\nwhere A\u2191 is the observable leading to the experimental result \"spin up\", whereas A\u2193\nleads to the result \"spin down\". To achieve a reliable measurement up to a significance\nlevel (\"infidelity\") \u03b1, a statistical analysis of the readout process [212] yields the result\nthat the number n of required measurements has a lower bound\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n2\n\u22121 ,\n(9)\nn > z1\u2212\u03b1\n\u03b7\n\nwhere z1\u2212\u03b1 is the quantile (critical value) of the standard normal distribution function,\n\u221a\n\u03a6(z1\u2212\u03b1 ) = 1 \u2212 \u03b1 = (1/2)[1 + erf(z1\u2212\u03b1 / 2)], and\n\u0012\n\u00132\nq\n\u221a\n\u03b7=\np\u2191 p\u2193 \u2212 (1 \u2212 p\u2191 )(1 \u2212 p\u2193 )\n(10)\n\ncan be interpreted as a measurement efficiency with \u03b7 \u2208 [0, 1]. For example, if p\u2191 = 1\u2212p\u2193 ,\nit is not possible to distinguish between the two spin states and \u03b7 = 0. In contrast, for\np\u2191 = p\u2193 = 1, the measurement is perfectly reliable and \u03b7 = 1. The case n = 1 (which is\nrealized, e.g., in the latter example) is called single-shot readout in the following. For a\nset of k qubits, the probability for a reliable measurement is given by 1 \u2212 \u03b2 = (1 \u2212 \u03b1)k ,\nwhere \u03b2 is the infidelity of the k-qubit readout. However, the number n of required\nmeasurements only grows with k according to n \u2265 2 (1/\u03b7 \u2212 1) log k/\u03b2 [213]. The\ndependence of n on k is therefore weaker than what might be naively expected.\n\n\f31\n\nRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\nDot formed\nB|| = 6T, gc = 0.5e2/h\nB|| = 6T, gc = 2e 2/h\nB|| = 0T, gc = 0.5e 2/h\n\n2\n\nB|| = 6T, gc = 0.5e /h\nno dot formed\ndot formed\n\n1.8\n\n0.6\n\n1.6\nVc (\u03bcV)\n\n1.2\n\n2.0\n\n1.0\n\nPolarization Pe\n\nV c / < Vc >\n\n1.4\n\n1.4\n1.2\n\n0.8\n1.0\n0.6\n\u2212100\n\n0.8\n\u221250\n\n0\nVg (mV)\n\n50\n\n100\n\n\u2212100\n\n\u22120.6\n\u221250\n\n0\nVg (mV)\n\n50\n\n100\n\nFigure 10.

Process. 3 115. c 2004 Springer-Verlag.\n\nThe magnetic moment of a single spin-1/2 is very small (on the order of \u03bcB =\n9.2741 * 10\u221224 J/T) and thus difficult to detect directly. Nevertheless, Rugar et al.\n[81] have recently detected a single spin in silicon dioxide using MRFM, as already\nmentioned in section 2.7. MRFM enables the direct observation of an oscillating spin\nup to 100 nm below the surface with nanometre resolution. Still, the sensitivity is\ncurrently not yet sufficient to detect whether a spin is originally in the state | \u2191i or in\nthe state | \u2193i. Many other proposals to detect spin states are based on the transfer of\ninformation stored in the spin degree of freedom to an orbital degree of freedom (\"spincharge conversion\") [9, 201, 202, 203, 214, 215, 216, 217, 82, 218, 219]. Initialization and\nreadout of spin states in quantum dots can be achieved, e.g., using a spin filter. This is\na device that only transmits electrons with one particular spin polarization, while the\nopposite spin polarization is blocked. Recher et al. [203] have proposed a spin-filter\nimplementation consisting of a quantum dot in the Coulomb blockade regime, weakly\ncoupled to two current leads. In a static magnetic field, the direction of the transmitted\nspin can be changed by tuning the gate voltage applied to the dot (see figures 9 and\n10). Experimental demonstrations of a spin filter have been achieved by Folk et al.\n[214], Potok et al. [215], Hanson et al. [201], and Elzerman et al. [202]. The first two of\nthese implementations have demonstrated the spin-filtering effect with a GaAs quantum\ndot in the open [214] and in the Coulomb-blockade regime [215] in a polarizer-analyzer\n\n\fRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\n\n32\n\ngeometry (see also figure 10). In the polarizer-analyzer geometry (see inset of figure\n10), the spin-selective analyzer was provided by a QPC with conductance tuned to less\nthan e2 /h [220]. A small perpendicular magnetic field B\u22a5 coupled the polarizer (i.e.,\nthe quantum dot structure to the left) and the analyzer (the QPC to the right) by\ntransverse focusing. A transverse magnetic field Bk was applied, leading to a different\nFermi wavelength of spin-up and spin-down electrons. By tuning the gate voltage of\nthe dot, the transmission of one or the other spin was suppressed due to destructive\ninterference of the coherent transport paths. With a constant current flowing between\nemitter (i.e., the dot) and collector (i.e., the QPC), peaks were observed in the voltage\nVc between collector and base whenever the distance between emitter and collector was\nan integer multiple of the cyclotron diameter of the transported electrons. In an inplane magnetic field Bk , the height of these peaks in Vc (which are called \"focusing\npeaks\") reflected the degree of spin polarization in the current if the QPC was in the\nspin-selective regime. The experiments by Hanson et al. [201] and Elzerman et al. [202]\nhave already been described in section 4.3. Elzerman et al. [202] demonstrated singleshot readout of a single electron spin in a quantum dot. A single-spin measurement\nof this type required a time \u2248 0.11 ms and the total fidelity of the spin readout was\nestimated to be 65%.\n4.7. Optical interaction and optical readout of spins\nIn this section, we first sketch some basics of optical transitions in quantum dots and\nthen focus on the optical detection of spin states. The currently very active field of\nultrafast laser technology suggests that single spin states can be optically detected and\nmanipulated within very short times (picoseconds or even femtoseconds), several orders\nof magnitude faster than in schemes based on the transport of electric charge.\nVia the absorption of a photon, an electron in a confined valence-band state can\nbe excited to a confined conduction-band state. For such inter-band transitions, optical\nselection rules apply and establish conditions on the quantum numbers of the optically\ncoupled states. Provided the spin-orbit interaction is nearly isotropic (Hso \u2248 \u03bbL * S, see\nalso the discussion in section 3.3.1), then it is a good approximation that the total\nangular momentum squared, J2 = (L + S)2 , provides a good quantum number in\nsemiconductors. Photons with circular polarization \u03c3 \u00b1 carry an angular momentum\nwith projection \u00b11 (in units of ~) along their propagation direction. For optical\ninteractions, the total angular momentum is conserved, linking the spin of electrons\nand the polarization of photons. For a two-dimensional quantum dot with circular\nconfinement, the z component Jz of J is a good quantum number (in contrast, an\nanisotropic shape in the plane induces mixing of angular momentum eigenstates). When\nJz is a good quantum number in GaAs or InAs dots, the energetically lowest optical\nexcitation at zero magnetic field typically includes two degenerate valence band states\nwith total angular momentum projections Jz = \u00b13/2, which are also called heavy-hole\n(hh) states. A circularly polarized photon that is irradiated along the quantization axis\n\n\fRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\n\n33\n\nz of J can excite one of the hh states to one of the conduction-band states with spin\n+1/2 or \u22121/2 [221]. For a given circular polarization, only one combination of these\nstates satisfies the selection rules. This leads to a direct correspondence between the\ncircular polarization of the photon and the spin of the optically excited electron. Taking\nadvantage of this for the readout of spin states, light-emitting diodes (\"spin-LEDs\") have\nbeen fabricated [7, 8], where the polarization of the emitted photons indicates the spin\npolarization of the electrons (or holes) injected into the spin-LED. A further step in\nnanoscale photonic and electronic technology has been taken recently by the growth\nof semiconductor nanowire superlattices [222, 223, 224]. By modulating the reactants\nduring catalytic growth of a nanowire, the nanowire finally consists of segments of\ndifferent materials, e.g., Si and SiGe [222], InAs and InP [223], or GaAs and GaP\n[224]. By alternating the two different materials, a superlattice can be formed. The\ncombination of n- and p-type semiconductors, e.g., n-Si and p-Si or n-InP and p-InP\n[224], enables the bottom-up assembly of nanoscale (spin-)LEDs.\n4.8. Negatively charged excitons in quantum dots\nSeveral methods have been developed to optically probe and manipulate states of single\nquantum dots [225, 226]. Optical schemes have further been proposed to achieve\ninitialization of electron spins (see section 4.9), for the detection of the T2 -time of electron\nspins (see section 5.1), for single-qubit gates (see section 5.2), and for two-qubit gates\n(see section 5.3). In these schemes and also in many other schemes exploiting the spin\nstates of an electron, a quantum dot initially contains a single excess electron. Optical\nexcitation of such a state creates a negatively charged exciton (sometimes also called\n\"trion\") in the dot, i.e., a compound of two conduction-band electrons and one valenceband hole (see figure 11). If the quantum dot is in the so-called strong confinement\nregime, the (single-particle) confinement energies are much larger than the Coulomb\ninteraction energies of the carriers in the dot. This criterion is typically satisfied\nfor small self-assembled dots and colloidal dots. The two electrons then occupy the\nlowest single-particle level of the dot and form a spin singlet. Note that the excess\nelectron initially occupies one of the available spin states. Due to the Pauli principle,\nthe absorption of a circularly polarized photon (as described in section 4.7) is only\npossible if the corresponding electron spin state is not already occupied. Figure 11\nshows that a \u03c3 \u2212 -polarized photon can only be absorbed if the spin of the excess electron\nis in the state | \u2193i, whereas a \u03c3 + -polarized photon can only be absorbed for | \u2191i. In\nthe photoluminescence spectrum, the lines belonging to these two transitions coincide\nfor zero magnetic field and split for non-zero magnetic fields. If a circularly polarized\nphoton with an energy that matches the corresponding transition energy is absorbed,\nthe initial spin state of the excess electron is identified. This experiment has recently\nbeen performed with a single InGaAs/GaAs dot by H\u00f6gele et al. [227] using highresolution laser absorption spectroscopy. Equivalently, the photoluminescence (which is\nonly emitted after a successful photon absorption) could be detected instead of the\n\n\fRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\n\n34\n\nFigure 11. The two Zeeman states | \u2193i and | \u2191i of a single electron in the dot are\nshown in (a) and (b), whereas (c) and (d) show the two Zeeman states |X\u2191\u2212 i and |X\u2193\u2212 i\nof a negatively charged exciton in the orbital ground state [229, 232]. As discussed in\nthe text, the two electrons in (c) and (d) form a spin singlet. The grey arrows indicate\nwhich electron-hole pair is coupled by a \u03c3 \u00b1 circularly polarized transition. In the\npresence of a static magnetic field along the z direction, the Zeeman splitting of the\nelectron spin states is \u2206ez and the Zeeman splitting of the charged exciton equals the\nhole Zeeman splitting \u2206hz . Here, we assume equal signs for the g-factors of electrons\nand holes.\n\nabsorption. One can also apply an electric field to the dot such that an electron\nand a hole tunnel out of the dot after a photon has been absorbed. Instead of the\nphotoluminescence, the resulting electric current (the so-called photocurrent) can then\nbe detected [228]. For a discussion of the limits of such spin-dependent optical schemes\ndue to the mixing of valence-band states, see section 4.9.\n4.9. Optical initialization of spin qubits\nThe spin of an excess electron in a quantum dot can be polarized for initialization by\nusing optical pumping methods [216, 217, 229]. As discussed in section 4.8, circularly\npolarized laser excitation can be used to optically address exclusively one of the two spin\nstates | \u2191i or | \u2193i. For initialization of a spin, the optical excitation can also be tuned to\nhigher-lying continuum states [216]. Alternatively, applying circularly polarized optical\n\u03c0-pulses in the presence of a static (or pulsed) transverse magnetic field also increases\nthe electron spin polarization [217]. In this scheme, the transverse magnetic field has a\nnegligible effect on the charged exciton states because the in-plane g-factor of the hole is\n\n\fRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\n\n35\n\ntypically zero in first order (the response of the charged exciton to an external magnetic\nfield is, in this case, determined by the hole spin since the two electrons form a singlet). A\ncircularly polarized photon can now be absorbed for only, say, | \u2193i. After the absorption\nof a photon, the precession of the spin is locked until, after recombination, the initial spin\nstate | \u2193i is restored. The other electron spin state, | \u2191i, blocks the photon absorption and\nis therefore rotated by the transverse magnetic field without interruption. By choosing\nsuitable pulse repetition rates and magnetic field strengths, the spin is polarized in the\nstate | \u2193i. Yet another way to achieve electron spin polarization is to apply a magnetic\nfield parallel to the laser beam and choose the circular polarization of the laser such\nthat the hole contained in the charged exciton is in its excited Zeeman level, as shown\nin figure 11 (c). Hole spin relaxation within the charged exciton (which occurs at\nelevated temperatures at even larger rates than those for optical recombination [230])\nand subsequent recombination leads then to an increased polarization of the electron\nspin in the state | \u2191i that does not allow photon absorption [229] (in contrast to the\nscheme mentioned above). To benefit from Pauli blocking of the absorption in these\nschemes, the bandwidth of the laser must be smaller than the splitting of hh and,\ntypically, light hole (lh) states (which have angular momentum Jz = \u00b11/2) and also\nthe energy difference to the state with one electron in the first excited level, forming a\ntriplet state with the electron in the orbital ground state. For self-assembled dots, this\nhh-lh splitting is on the order of 10 meV, and the energy difference to the mentioned\nstate with an electron triplet is approximately 40 meV [216].\nIn the context of optical transitions including hh and lh states it has turned out\nthat the geometry of the quantum dot can also impose a limitation on the efficiency\nof spin-dependent optical processes. As already mentioned in section 4.1, capped selfassembled dots are elliptical, rather than circular in shape. This anisotropy leads to\na mixing especially of the valence band states (since they are close in energy to each\nother). If the bandwidth of the circularly polarized laser is larger than the Zeeman\nsplitting of the electron states, the admixture of, e.g., lh states with the hh states (as in\nbulk semiconductors) increases the probability that a photon is absorbed even though\nthe spin is in the state where Pauli blocking should be effective [221]. However, if a\ncircularly polarized laser with a bandwidth smaller than the electron Zeeman splitting\nis applied in resonant optical experiments [227], the mixing of the hole states has no\neffect on the absorption properties of the quantum dot because then, again, only one of\nthe electron spin states allows for photon absorption.\n5. Future Goals\nIn this section we discuss recent theoretical proposals to measure the T2 time of single\nelectron spins in quantum dots and also proposals for single-qubit rotations.\n\n\fRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\n\n36\n\n5.1. Detection of single-electron spin decoherence\nAfter the recent successful measurements of the T1 -lifetime (and lower bounds for\nit) of single electron spins in quantum dots (see section 4.3), measurements of the\ndecoherence time T2 are due. To achieve such an experiment, an initial coherent\nevolution of the electron spin must be produced. This can be done, e.g., with electron\nspin resonance (ESR) or by inducing spin precession in a transverse magnetic field.\nThe decay of the spin coherence can then be measured [162]. Several proposals of\nthis type have been made. Engel and Loss [218, 219] have proposed a measurement\nof the sequential tunnelling current through a dot containing a single electron spin in\nthe presence of ESR excitation. Sequential tunnelling, in general, describes a regime\nwhere charge transport only occurs via a sequence of first-order tunnelling processes.\nIn the regime when sequential tunnelling is only possible via an intermediate singlet\nstate on the dot [218, 219], the stationary current I is a Lorentzian as a function of\nthe ESR detuning \u03b4ESR = \u03c9ESR \u2212 ge \u03bcB B, where \u03c9ESR is the ESR frequency. The\ninverse of the linewidth of I(\u03b4ESR ) provides a lower bound for the intrinsic T2 time\nof a single electron spin. Further, the coherent Rabi oscillations due to ESR pulses\n \u0304 p ) as a function of the ESR pulse\ncan be observed in the time-averaged current I(t\nlength tp . Subsequently, Martin et al. [231] have proposed the electrical detection of\nsingle-electron spin resonance via a nearby field-effect transistor conduction channel.\nIn contrast to a transport measurement, Gywat et al. [229, 232] have theoretically\nstudied the optical detection of magnetic resonance (ODMR) to measure the T2 -time of\na single electron spin in a quantum dot. In this approach, the dot initially contains a\nsingle excess electron that is subject to ESR excitation. Unlike a tunnelling experiment\n[218, 219, 231], optical transitions are subject to selection rules and are not restricted to\nthe Coulomb blockade regime, e.g., if the excess electron is present due to n-doping\nand is not electrically injected. Further, an ODMR experiment can be performed\nwithout connecting the dot to current leads, which reduces decoherence. One can\nadditionally benefit from the high sensitivity of photodetectors. For a \u03c3 \u2212 -polarized\nlaser with a sufficiently low bandwidth the absorption of a photon is Pauli-blocked if\nthe spin is in the state | \u2191i, as discussed in section 4.8 (see also figure 11). The laser\nfrequency and polarization (\u03c3 \u2212 ) in the considered ODMR scheme are adjusted such\nthat in the case of successful photon absorption, a negatively charged exciton, as shown\nin figure 11 (c), is created, where the two electrons form a singlet and the hole is in\nthe excited Zeeman level of the orbital ground state. From here, there are two possible\nrelaxation paths, either the direct optical recombination, or a hole spin flip and an\noptical transition with opposite circular polarization. This second relaxation channel\nis responsible for an accumulation of population in the spin ground state (exactly as\ndiscussed in section 4.9 for spin initialization) since the optical recombination rate is\nusually much faster than the ESR Rabi frequency. For cw ESR and cw laser excitations,\nthe stationary photoluminescence [229] or, alternatively, the stationary photocurrent\n[232] has been found to be a Lorentzian as a function of the ESR detuning \u03b4ESR . As in\n\n\fRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\n\n37\n\nthe detection of the ESR linewidth using sequential tunnelling, the inverse linewidth of\nthe photoluminescence or the photocurrent provides a lower bound for T2 . Additional\nbroadening due to the optical transitions is greatly reduced for a hole spin flip rate that\nis comparable to or larger than the optical recombination rate, as well as for an optical\nRabi frequency on the order of 1/T2 or smaller. Alternatively, pulsed laser excitation\ncan be applied in addition to an ESR excitation. This enables the detection of spin\nRabi oscillations as a function of the laser pulse repetition time \u03c4rep . Because of hole\nspin flips, the electron spin at the end of a laser pulse is polarized as mentioned above.\nDuring the \"off\"-time of the laser, the spin is performing Rabi oscillations. When the\nsubsequent laser pulse arrives, the spin state | \u2193i is read out. The time-averaged number\nof photons that are emitted per laser repetition period then directly displays the electron\nspin Rabi oscillations as a function of \u03c4rep . Increasing the length of the laser pulses to\nvalues longer than the exciton lifetime iterates the optical pumping scheme and therefore\nenhances its efficiency. This results in an improved visibility of the oscillations in the\nphotoluminescence or in the photocurrent. Using the same optical excitation setup,\nelectron spin precession can also be observed in the presence of a transverse magnetic\nfield [232].\n5.2. Single-qubit rotations\nA further important step towards the goal of quantum computation is the\nimplementation of a single-qubit gate. To achieve this for the Loss-DiVincenzo proposal,\nseveral possible strategies have been developed [9, 88, 1]. The simplest way to rotate\na spin is by applying a pulsed magnetic field. In an array of quantum dots, such\nfields could be applied to single spins, e.g., by scanning-probe tips [9]. Further, in the\npresence of an rf magnetic field applied to an ensemble of electron spins, the tunability\nand precise control of the individual Zeeman splittings is sufficient to produce single spin\nrotations, as already mentioned in section 2.1. When the ESR resonance condition is\nmatched, the spin rotates with maximum amplitude, according to the well-known Rabi\nformula. Detuning of the Zeeman splitting of an individual spin from the ESR resonance\nslows its precession frequency and the spin stops rotating entirely when the detuning is\nlarger than the ESR linewidth. Control of the Zeeman splitting at the single-spin level is\ntherefore another way to perform single-spin rotations. This can be achieved in principle\nby controlling local magnetic fields or local Overhauser fields. For a structure designed\nto apply ESR excitation to a single quantum dot, see figure 12. Another approach is\nthe individual control of the electron g-factor instead of the local magnetic field. In\nquantum wells, there has been recent pioneering work in this direction [233, 234, 235].\nSalis et al. [233] have demonstrated electrically controlled modulation of the g-factor\nin an AlGaAs quantum well containing a gradient in the Al concentration. Here, the\nelectron wave function was shifted between regions with different Al concentration via\napplied gate voltages, which resulted in the observation of a different electron g-factor.\nKato et al. [234] have even demonstrated voltage-controlled modulation of the g-tensor.\n\n\fRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\n\n38\n\nFigure 12. SEM picture and scheme of a structure to apply a local rf magnetic field\nto a quantum dot. Such a structure might be used as a prototype of a single qubit\ngate, or for the measurement of the electron spin decoherence time. The indicated\nAC current (in the horizontal direction) leads to an alternating magnetic field BAC .\nIn combination with a static magnetic field B0 , ESR can be induced with an electron\nlocated in the dot. From the modulation of the DC current (in the vertical direction)\nas a function of the frequency of the AC current, the electron spin decoherence time\ncan be measured [218, 219]. (Figure courtesy of W G van der Wiel [236].)\n\nThis allows the induction of ESR without time-dependent magnetic fields. Further\nexperiments by Kato et al. [235] exploited the spin-orbit interaction to achieve coherent\nspin manipulation in strained semiconductor films without the application of magnetic\nfields.\nAlternative proposals to produce single-spin rotations are related to all-optical\nRaman transitions [25] and stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) [25, 92,\n237, 238], a method based on two-photon Raman transitions which has already been\napplied to atoms and molecules to transfer a precisely controlled population between\ntwo quantum states [239]. While Troiani et al. [92] have also considered the realization\nof conditional and unconditional quantum gates using an additional adjacent quantum\ndot, Chen et al. [237] have proposed a STIRAP process with no auxiliary state, but in\nthe presence of a transverse magnetic field. In this setup, control of the relative phase\nand the relative intensity of two applied laser pulses enables an arbitrary spin rotation\nfor a given polarization of the light and direction of the transverse magnetic field [237].\nAs an alternative method of performing a spin rotation on an excess electron confined to\na quantum dot, Calarco et al. [238] have proposed to excite lh states via a sequence of a\nlinearly and then a circularly polarized laser \u03c0-pulse. Given this abundance of proposals\nfor single-qubit gates, there is great hope for working experimental realizations in the\nnear future.\n5.3. Two-Qubit Gates\nSwapping of the spin states of two electrons located in closely spaced quantum dots\nseems by now to be a realistic first experimental step towards a two-qubit gate for\nspins. As explained in section 2.1, this can be achieved by controlling the overlap of\nthe two wave functions of the electrons and thus the singlet-triplet splitting J. The\n\n\fRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\n\n39\n\ninterdot tunnel splitting and J can be determined from a transport experiment in the\nsequential tunnelling regime [240, 241, 242]. Recently, J has been measured for two\nelectrons in a single gated quantum dot by detecting inelastic cotunnelling above and\nbelow a magnetic field driven singlet-triplet transition [117]. In the cotunnelling regime,\nonly second-order tunnelling processes contribute to charge transport. Because the dot\nwas elliptical, a two-electron wave function similar to that in a double dot was expected.\nTwo different samples yielded J \u2248 0.2 meV and J \u2248 0.57 meV at B = 0. The critical\nmagnetic field for the singlet-triplet transition (where J = 0) has been measured to\nbe B \u2217 \u2248 1.3 T. For the interaction parameter [242], \u03c6 \u2248 0.5 \u00b1 0.1 has\np been obtained,\nindicating that the ground state given by |+ \u2191, + \u2193i \u2212 \u03c6|\u2212 \u2191, \u2212 \u2193i/ 1 + \u03c62 (where \u00b1\nstands for the symmetric/antisymmetric orbital wave function) consists of a singlet with\na significant admixture of single-electron orbitals due to the electron-electron interaction.\nThe entanglement of the two electron spins in the state above can be quantified by the\nconcurrence C = 2\u03c6/(1 + \u03c62 ) [242, 40]. The experimental result C \u2248 0.8 shows that\nelectron-electron interaction reduces the degree of spin entanglement from its maximum\n(C = 1), which is obtained for a singlet (having \u03c6 = 1). This demonstration strongly\nencourages that similar results might be soon obtained in double dots (which are needed\nfor spatially separating the two qubits).\nIn addition to the two-qubit gate that is controlled via the tunnel coupling of the\ntwo dots (see section 2.1), there is also a proposal for an optical two-qubit phase gate\n[238]. In this proposal, a two-qubit phase gate is established by applying an adiabatically\nchirped laser pulse (this is a pulse with a time-dependent frequency) to two neighbouring\nquantum dots, each with one excess electron. The desirable phase of the two-qubit gate\nis accumulated during the (electrostatic) interaction time of the two charged excitons\nthat are excited in the two dots. The adiabatic change of the laser detuning protects\nthe system from interaction with phonons, even in the presence of hole-state mixing.\nThe combination of such a two-qubit gate with an optical single-qubit gate (as outlined\nin section 5.2) would finally enable all-optical quantum computation using spins in\nquantum dots.\n6. Conclusions\nIn this tutorial we have discussed theoretical concepts and the present status\nof experimental achievements towards the implementation of quantum information\nprocessing using electron spins in quantum dots. The demonstration of working single\nand two-qubit gates and finally the production of quantum dot arrays that enable\nthe application of an entire quantum algorithm including error correction are the\nmajor problems to tackle towards the goal of a solid-state implementation of quantum\ninformation processing using electron spins in quantum dots.\n\n\fRecipes for spin-based quantum computing\n\n40\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank D N Bulaev, H-A Engel, K Ensslin, S I Erlingsson, V N Golovach, A H\u00f6gele,\nL P Kouwenhoven, J Lehmann, C M Marcus, P M Petroff and W G van der Wiel for\nuseful discussions and for supplying valuable material to this work.
