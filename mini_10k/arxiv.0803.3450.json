Introduction\nThe Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN will soon\ntake us to a new frontier with unprecedented high energy\nand luminosity. Major discoveries of exciting new physics\nat the Terascale are highly anticipated. The existence\nof massive neutrinos clearly indicates the need for new\nphysics beyond the Standard Model (SM) [1]. It is thus\npressing to investigate the physics potential of the LHC in\nthis regard. The leading operator relevant for neutrino\nmasses in the context of the SM [2] is (\u03ba/\u039b)lL lL HH,\nwhere lL and H stand for the SU (2)L leptonic and Higgs\ndoublet, respectively. After the electroweak symmetry\nbreaking (EWSB), the neutrino Majorana mass reads as\nm\u03bd \u223c \u03bav02 /\u039b, where v0 \u2248 246 GeV. The crucial issue\nis to understand the origin of this operator in a given\nextension of the SM in order to identify the dimensionless\ncoupling \u03ba and the mass scale \u039b at which the new physics\nenters.\nThere exist several simple renormalizable extensions of\nthe SM to generate neutrino Majorana masses and mixing. (i) The simplest one is perhaps the Type-I seesaw\nmechanism [3], where one adds fermionic gauge singlets\nN . The resulting neutrino mass is given by m\u03bd \u221d v02 /MN .\nThe smallness of m\u03bd <\n\u223c 1 eV is thus understood by the\n\"seesaw\" spirit if MN \u226b v0 . The interests of searching\nfor heavy Majorana neutrinos N at the LHC have been\nlately renewed [4]. However, it is believed that any signal of N would indicate a more subtle mechanism beyond\nthe simple Type I seesaw due to the naturally small mixing VN2 \u03bd \u223c m\u03bd /MN . (ii) A more appealing mechanism,\nat least from the phenomenological point of view, is the\nType II seesaw mechanism [5]. In this scenario the Higgs\nsector of the SM is extended by adding an SU (2)L Higgs\ntriplet, \u2206 \u223c (1, 3, 1) under the SM gauge groups. After EWSB the neutrino mass is given by m\u03bd \u221d Y\u03bd v\u2206 ,\nwhere Y\u03bd and v\u2206 are the Yukawa coupling and the vacuum expectation value of the triplet, respectively. If the\ntriplet mass is accessible at the LHC, M\u2206 . O(1) TeV,\nthen this scenario may lead to very rich phenomenol-\n\nogy. Experimentally verifying this mechanism would be\nof fundamental importance to understand the neutrino\nmass generation and its connection to the EWSB. For\nother proposals with exotic leptonic representations or\nradiative mass generations, see [6].\nIn this Letter, we explore the feasibility to test the\nType II seesaw mechanism at the LHC assuming that the\nHiggs triplet is kinematically accessible. We focus on the\nexciting possibility to determinate the neutrino spectrum\nthrough the lepton violating Higgs decays in the theory.\nRecently, several groups [7, 8, 9] have studied the possibility to distinguish between the neutrino spectra using the predictions for the decays of the doubly charged\nHiggs. Unfortunately, this method suffers from the dependence on the unknown Majorana phases. Here we\npoint out for the first time that the best way to determinate the neutrino spectrum in this context is through the\nlepton-number violating decays H + \u2192 e+\ni \u03bd\u0304 (i = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 ),\nsince those are independent of the unknown Majorana\nphases. We advocate that the associated production\nH \u00b1\u00b1 H \u2213 is crucial in order to test the triplet nature of\nthe model. With semi-realistic Monte Carlo simulations,\nwe demonstrate how to reconstruct the signal events\n\u00b1 \u2213\nH \u00b1\u00b1 H \u2213 \u2192 e\u00b1\ni ej ek \u03bd and suppress the backgrounds up\nto 1 TeV of the Higgs mass. We also show how to test\nthis theory when the leptonic channels are suppressed.\nThe discovery of the predicted signals at the LHC would\nprovide us crucial information about the neutrino mass\nand its connection to the electroweak symmetry breaking\nmechanism.\nII. The Type II Seesaw for Neutrino Masses\nThe Higgs sector of the Type II seesaw scenario is composed of the SM Higgs H(1, 2, 1/2) and a scalar triplet\n\u2206(1, 3, 1). The crucial terms for the neutrino mass generation in the theory are\nT\n\u2212 Y\u03bd lL\nC i\u03c32 \u2206 lL + \u03bc H T i\u03c32 \u2206\u2020 H + h.c.\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the Yukawa coupling Y\u03bd is a 3 \u00d7 3 complex symmetric matrix. The lepton number is explicitly broken by\n\n\f2\ntwo units due to the simultaneous presence of the Yukawa\ncoupling Y\u03bd and the Higgs term proportional to the \u03bc parameter. From the minimization\nof the scalar potential\n\u221a\n2\none finds v\u2206 = \u03bcv02 / 2M\u2206\n. Therefore, the neutrinos\nacquire a Majorana mass given by\n\u221a\n2\nM\u03bd = 2 Y\u03bd v\u2206 = Y\u03bd \u03bc v02 /M\u2206\n.\n(2)\nThis equation is the key relation of the Type II seesaw\nscenario. The neutrino mass is triggered by the EWSB\nand its smallness is associated with a large mass scale\nM\u2206 . With appropriate choices of the Yukawa matrix elements, one can easily accommodate the neutrino masses\nand mixing consistent with the experimental observation.\nFor the purpose of illustration, we adopt the values of the\nmasses and mixing at 2\u03c3 level from a recent global fit[10].\nII.A General Properties of the Higgs Sector\nAfter the EWSB, there are seven massive physical Higgs\nbosons: H1 , H2 , A, H \u00b1 , and H \u00b1\u00b1 , where H1 is SMlike and the rest of the Higgs states are \u2206-like. Neglecting the Higgs quartic interactions one finds MH2 \u2243\nMA \u2243 MH + \u2243 MH ++ = M\u2206 . Since we are interested\nin a mass scale accessible at the LHC, we thus focus on\n110 GeV < M\u2206 < 1 TeV, where the lower bound is from\ndirect searches [11]. Working in the physical basis for\nthe fermions we find that the Yukawa interactions can be\nwritten as\n\u03bdLT C \u0393+ H + eL , and eTL C \u0393++ H ++ eL ,\n\u0393+ =\n\nVP\u2020MN S\nc\u03b8+ mdiag\nV\u2217\nmdiag VP\u2020MN S\n\u03bd\n,\n, \u0393++ = P MN S\u221a \u03bd\nv\u2206\n2 v\u2206\n\nwhere c\u03b8+ = cos \u03b8+ , \u03b8+ is the mixing angle in the charged\nHiggs sector and v\u2206 . 1 GeV from the \u03c1-parameter constraints. VP MN S = Vl (\u03b812 , \u03b823 , \u03b813 , \u03b4) \u00d7 KM is the leptonic mixing matrix and KM = diag(ei\u03a61 /2 , 1, ei\u03a62 /2 ) is\nthe Majorana phase factor. The values of the physical\ncouplings \u0393+ and \u0393++ are thus governed by the spectrum and mixing angles of the neutrinos, and they in\nturn characterize the branching fractions of the \u2206L = 2\nHiggs decays. For a previous study of the doubly charged\nHiggs decays see [12].\nThe two leading decay modes for the heavy Higgs\nbosons are the \u2206L = 2 leptonic mode and the (longitudinal) gauge boson pair mode. The ratio between them\nfor the H ++ decay reads as\n\u0393(H ++ \u2192 l+ l+ )\n|\u0393++ |2 v04\n\u2248\n\u2248\n2 v2\n\u0393(H ++ \u2192 W + W + )\nM\u2206\n\u2206\n\n\u0012\n\nm\u03bd\nM\u2206\n\n\u00132 \u0012\n\nv0\nv\u2206\n\n\u00134\n\n, (3)\n\nusing m\u03bd /M\u2206 \u223c 1 eV/1 TeV, one finds that these two\ndecay modes are comparable when v\u2206 \u2248 10\u22124 GeV. It is\nthus clear that for a smaller value of v\u2206 (a larger Yukawa\ncoupling), the leptonic modes dominate, while for larger\nvalues, the gauge boson modes take over. In the case\nof the singly charged Higgs, H \u00b1 , there is one additional\n\nFIG. 1: Leptonic branching fractions vs the lightest neutrino\nmass when \u03a6i = 0.

We present a more detailed\ndiscussion elsewhere [13]. In our discussions thus far, we\nhave assumed the mass degeneracy for the Higgs triplet.\nEven if there is no tree-level mass difference, the SM\ngauge interactions generate the splitting of the masses via\nradiative corrections, leading to \u2206M = MH ++ \u2212 MH + =\n540 MeV [14]. The transitions between two heavy triplet\nHiggs bosons via the SM gauge interactions, such as the\nthree-body decays H ++ \u2192 H + W +\u2217 , H + \u2192 H 0 W +\u2217\nmay be sizable if kinematically accessible. We find [13]\nthat these transitions will not have a significant branching ratio unless \u2206M > 1 GeV. In fact, our analyses will\nremain valid as long as H ++ and H + are the lower-lying\nstates in the triplet and they are nearly degenerate. We\nwill thus ignore the mass-splitting effect in the current\nstudy.\nII.B Higgs Decays and the Neutrino Properties\nFor v\u2206 < 10\u22124 GeV, the dominant channels for the\nheavy Higgs boson decay are the \u2206L = 2 di-leptons.

In accordance with the NH spectrum\nand the large atmosphere mixing (\u03b823 ), the leading channels are H ++ \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 + , \u03bc+ \u03bc+ , and the channel e+ e+ is\nmuch smaller. When the spectrum is inverted, the dominant channel is H ++ \u2192 e+ e+ instead. Also is seen in\nFig. 1(b) the H + \u2192 e+ \u03bd\u0304 dominance in the IH. In the\ncase of NH the dominant channels are H + \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bd\u0304 and\nH + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd\u0304. In both cases of NH and IH, the off-diagonal\nchannel H ++ \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bc+ is dominant due to the large mixing. In the limit of Quasi-Degenerate (QD) neutrinos one\nfinds that the three diagonal channels are quite similar,\nbut the off-diagonal channels are suppressed.\nThe properties of all leptonic decays of the charged\nHiggs bosons are summarized in Table. I. The effects of\nthe Majorana phases are neglected so far. The Higgs decays are not very sensitive to the phase \u03a62 , with a maximal reduction of H ++ \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 + , \u03bc+ \u03bc+ and enhancement\nof \u03bc+ \u03c4 + up to a factor of two in the NH. The phase\n\u03a61 , however, has a dramatic impact on the H ++ decay in the IH. This is shown in Fig. 2. We see that for\n\u03a61 \u2248 \u03c0 the dominant channels switch to e+ \u03bc+ , e+ \u03c4 +\nfrom e+ e+ , \u03bc+ \u03c4 + as in the zero phase limit. This provides the best hope to probe the Majorana phase. The\ndecays H \u00b1 \u2192 e+\ni \u03bd\u0304, on the other hand, are independent\nof the unknown Majorana phases, leaving the BR predictions robust. Therefore, using the lepton violating decays\nof the singly charged Higgs one can determinate the neutrino spectrum without any ambiguity. This is one of our\nmain results of our Letter.\nIII. Testing the Model at the LHC\nWe consider the following production channels\nq q\u0304 \u2192 \u03b3 \u2217 , Z \u2217 \u2192 H ++ H \u2212\u2212 , and q q \u0304\u2032 \u2192 W \u2217 \u2192 H \u00b1\u00b1 H \u2213 .\nThe total cross sections versus the mass at the LHC are\n\nFIG. 2: Leptonic branching fractions of H ++ decay versus\nthe Majorana phase \u03a61 in the IH for m3 \u2248 0.\n\nshown in Fig. 3. The cross sections range in 100 \u2212 0.1\nfb for a mass of 200\u22121000 GeV, leading to a potentially\nobservable signal with a high luminosity. The associated\nproduction H \u00b1\u00b1 H \u2213 [15] is crucial to test the triplet nature of H \u00b1\u00b1 and H \u00b1 .\nIII.A Purely Leptonic Modes\nFor v\u2206 < 10\u22124 GeV, we wish to identify as many channels of leptonic flavor combination as possible to study\nthe neutrino mass pattern. The e's and \u03bc's are experimentally easy to identify, while \u03c4 's can be identified via\ntheir simple charged tracks (1-prong and 3-prongs). We\nmake use of the important feature that the \u03c4 's from the\nheavy Higgs decays are highly relativistic and the missing neutrinos are collimated along the charged tracks, so\nthat the \u03c4 momentum p(\u03c4 ) can be reconstructed effectively. In fact, we can reconstruct up to three \u03c4 's if we\nassume the Higgs pair production with equal masses [13].\nThe fully reconstructable signal events are thus\nH ++ H \u2212\u2212 \u2192 l+ l+ l\u2212 l\u2212 , l\u00b1 l\u00b1 l\u2213 \u03c4 \u2213 , l\u00b1 l\u00b1 \u03c4 \u2213 \u03c4 \u2213 ,\nH \u00b1\u00b1 H \u2213\n\nl+ \u03c4 + l\u2212 \u03c4 \u2212 , l\u00b1 \u03c4 \u00b1 \u03c4 \u2213 \u03c4 \u2213 ,\n\u2192 l\u00b1 l\u00b1 l\u2213 \u03bd, l\u00b1 l\u00b1 \u03c4 \u2213 \u03bd,\n\nwhere l = e, \u03bc. We have performed a full kinematical\nanalysis for those modes, including judicious cuts to separate the backgrounds, energy-momentum smearing to\nsimulate the detector effects, and the p(\u03c4 ) and M\u2206 reconstruction. We find our kinematical reconstruction procedure highly efficient, with about 50% for M\u2206 = 200 GeV\nand even higher for a heavier mass. With a 300 fb\u22121 luminosity, there will still be several reconstructed events\nin the leading channels up to M\u2206 \u223c 1 TeV with negligible\nbackgrounds.\nWe summarize the leading reconstructable channels\nand their achievable branching fractions in Table II. The\nH \u00b1 decays are robust to determinate the mass pattern\nsince they are independent of the Majorana phases.

If the Majorana\nphases play an important role, then the H ++ decay channels are much less predictable. Always one can use the\nH \u00b1 decays to determinate the neutrino spectrum since\nthose are independent of the Majorana phases. For a\nspecial case in the IH, the significant changes in the decay rate of H ++ with e+ e+ , \u03bc+ \u03c4 + \u2194 e+ \u03bc+ , e+ \u03c4 + offer\nthe best hope to probe \u03a61 . In a less favorable scenario,\nv\u2206 > 2\u00d710\u22124 GeV, the leptonic channels are suppressed.\nThe decays H \u00b1\u00b1 \u2192 W \u00b1 W \u00b1 indicate the existence of v\u2206 ,\nwhile the decays H + \u2192 tb\u0304 and H + \u2192 W + H1 are due to\nthe mixing between the SM Higgs and the triplet. Statistically significant signals are achievable up to M\u2206 \u2248 600\nGeV. In the most optimistic situation, v\u2206 \u223c 10\u22124 GeV,\nthe leptonic and gauge boson channels may be available\nsimultaneously.\nAcknowledgments: We thank E. Ma and L.-T.

Summary\nThe feasibility to test the Type II seesaw mechanism at\nthe LHC has been studied. We first emphasize the importance to observe the associated production H \u00b1\u00b1 H \u2213 to\nestablish the triplet nature of the Higgs field. In the optimistic scenarios, v\u2206 < 10\u22124 GeV, one can test the theory\nup to M\u2206 \u223c 1 TeV, by identifying the leading decay channels as either H ++ \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 + , \u03bc+ \u03bc+ , \u03bc+ \u03c4 + , H + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd\u0304\n\n[1] See e.g., M.
