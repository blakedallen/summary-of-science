The Ising-Heisenberg chain discussed in Ref. 3 (showing only two unit cells). The bonds of the Ising chain (1-10 100 - . . . ) are decorated with Heisenberg dimers (2-3), (20 -30 ),\n\u0001\n. . . . The partition function of this chain is exactly solvable.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn a 1959 paper M. E. Fisher introduced the general\nbond-decorated Ising model as one example of a set of exactly solvable transformations of spin-1/2 Ising models.1\nA bond-decorated Ising model has an \"arbitrary statistical mechanical system\" inserted in every original Ising\nbond. The partition function of this decorated model is\nrelated to the partition function of the original or bare\nIsing model by the addition of a prefactor and a renormalization of the coupling constants and magnetic moments (the Ising model is supposed to be in a parallel\nmagnetic field).2 Knowledge of the partition function of\na given Ising model thus allows one to obtain the partition function of any bond-decorated version of that Ising\nmodel.\nMore recently, Stre\u010dka and Ja\u0161\u010dur have used the\nmethod of bond-decoration to investigate the thermodynamics of mixed Ising-Heisenberg chains in parallel magnetic fields where the decorating unit is a spin\ndimer or trimer with anisotropic Heisenberg coupling (see\nFig. 1).3,4 The partition function of these chains is readily\nobtained from the known partition function of the Ising\nchain and the energy levels of the decorating unit. Therefore, they could calculate exact magnetic properties and\ntheoretically show, for example, the existence of magnetization plateaus in certain bond-alternating chains.\n\nThe convenience of the decorated Ising chain as a theoretical model for spin chains derives from the relative\nease with which exact solutions are obtained, in contrast\nfor example with the pure Heisenberg chain, for which\nno exact partition function has been found. Up to now,\nthis property of solvability has been the prime motive\nfor the study of these chains in the literature. Indeed, in\nRef. 3 the decorated Ising chain was considered as a substitute for the intractable Heisenberg model, and in Ref. 4\nthe principle reason for introducing Ising bonds-to replace the more reasonable Heisenberg bonds-in a chain\nof Cu2+ ions was the desire to obtain a solvable model.\nThis approach can be applied to any type of Heisenberg\nchain with a repeating unit: replace enough-preferably\nferromagnetic-Heisenberg bonds by Ising bonds to obtain a decorated Ising chain that is solved easily and,\nin some cases, exhibits thermodynamic properties that\nare qualitatively comparable with those of the original\nchain.5,6\nHowever, the role of the decorated Ising chain in the\nfield of one-dimensional magnetism is not confined to\nthat of a simplified model of realistic quantum spin\nchains. In this paper we show that some new molecular rings and chains are real examples of decorated Ising\nsystems. Concretely, we treat a [DyCuMoCu] infinite\nchain7 and a (DyCr)4 tetrameric ring.8 These compounds\nwere recently synthesized in the course of the ongoing\nsynthetic efforts to make new and better single-chain\nmagnets (SCMs) and single-molecule magnets (SMMs),\nwhose characteristic property is a blocking or slow relaxation of magnetization at low temperatures.9 We will not\nbe concerned here with these dynamical aspects of their\nmagnetism, but only with their static magnetic properties. A necessary property of SMMs and SCMs is a\nmagnetic anisotropy. One line of approach is to introduce anisotropy by means of lanthanide ions, whether or\nnot in combination with transition metal ions.10,11 The\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 2. Part of the decorated Ising chain. In each Ising\nbond is inserted an arbitrary statistical mechanical system1 ,\ncalled decorating unit, that interacts only with the two Ising\nspins si at the vertices of the bond. The Ising spin variables\ncommute with the Hamiltonian and have definite values in\nthe eigenstates of the chain.\n\ntwo compounds considered here are products of this approach, with dysprosium as lanthanide ion.\nThe Dy3+ ion plays a crucial role in these systems;\nthe nature of the ground state of this ion in its ligand\nenvironment determines whether the system is a decorated Ising system or not and consequently, whether its\npartition function is exactly solvable or not. The ground\nKramers doublet of Dy3+ must have complete uniaxial\nmagnetic anisotropy12 and must be separated from excited Kramers doublets by an amount that is large compared with the exchange coupling (typically, this separation must be 100 cm\u22121 or more).13 The required information on the ground and excited doublets of the\nDy3+ monomer can be derived from ab initio calculations\non the monomer complex, isolated from the polynuclear\ncompound.7,8\nThe [DyCuMoCu] chain and the (DyCr)4 ring are\nshown to be decorated Ising chains in an arbitrarily directed magnetic field. The magnetic properties, in particular powder magnetization and susceptibility, are calculated with the help of the transfer-matrix method, which\nis a bit more general and convenient for numerical computation than the renormalization of the Ising parameters,\nwhich was used by Fisher and by Stre\u010dka and Ja\u0161\u010dur.\nThe results compare well with experiment and allow to\ndetermine values for the exchange coupling constants.\nThe excited crystal field Kramers doublets (or Stark\nlevels) of Dy3+ are not included in the decorated Ising\nmodel. Because of their relatively low energetic position,\nthese Kramers doublets can have a non-negligible contribution to the magnetic properties of the chain. We account for this in a first approximation by adding this contribution, as calculated ab initio for the monomeric Dy3+\ncomplex, to the results of the decorated Ising model.\nII.\nA.\n\nTHEORETICAL BACKGROUND\n\nDecorated Ising chain and transfer-matrix\nsolution\n\nThe decorated Ising chain may be divided into units\ndelimited by the Ising spins, as in Fig. 2. The Hamiltonian of the decorated Ising chain (or ring) of length n\nmay accordingly be written as follows:\n\u0124 = \u01251 (s1 , s2 )+\u01252 (s2 , s3 )+\u01253 (s3 , s4 )+. . .+\u0125n (sn , sn+1 ),\n(1)\n\nwhere the subhamiltonians \u0125i correspond to units of the\nchain. If the chain is closed into a ring, periodic boundary conditions apply by identifying the last with the first\nspin: sn+1 \u2261 s1 . The Ising spins si commute with the\nsubhamiltonians and the subhamiltonians commute with\neach other:\n[si , \u0125j ] = 0\n\nand\n\n[\u0125i , \u0125j ] = 0.\n\n(2)\n\nIt is further assumed that there is no direct interaction\nbetween the decorating units themselves, i.e., two different \u0125i have no variables in common, except for an si when\nthey are neighbors. In writing Eq. (1) we made use of\nthe fact that the Ising spins are conserved variables and\nmay be considered as parameters rather than operators.\nIn the case of spin-1/2, they take on the values +1/2 and\n\u22121/2, so that to each decorating unit there correspond\nfour different subhamiltonians \u0125i (si , si+1 ).14\nSince there is no direct interaction between the decorating units of the chain, the subhamiltonians \u0125i in\nEq. (1) work-for a given set of si values-on disjunct\nspaces. An eigenfunction of \u0124 is then simply a direct\nproduct of n independent eigenfunctions, one of each \u0125i .\nThe corresponding energy is:\nE = \u03b51k1 (s1 , s2 ) + \u03b52k2 (s2 , s3 ) + \u03b53k3 (s3 , s4 ) + . . .\n(3)\n+ \u03b5nkn (sn , sn+1 ),\nwhere \u03b5iki (si , si+1 ) is the ki -th energy level of \u0125i (si , si+1 ).\nFollowing Ref. 1 we write the partition function of one\ndecorating unit for fixed si and si+1 on the bond vertices:\nX\n\u03c8i (si , si+1 ) =\nexp[\u2212\u03b2\u03b5ik (si , si+1 )],\n(4)\nk\n\nwhere \u03b2 = 1/kT . The total partition function for the\nchain is then given by\nX\nZn =\n\u03c81 (s1 , s2 )\u03c82 (s2 , s3 ) . . . \u03c8n (sn , sn+1 ).\ns1 ,s2 ,...,sn+1\n\n(5)\nThis is the well-known form of a transfer-matrix\nsolution.15 Each decorated bond (or pair of neighboring\nIsing spins) is represented by a transfer matrix Ti whose\nelements are the \u03c8i (si , si+1 ), the values of si labeling the\nrows and the values of si+1 labeling the columns. Explicitly for the spin-1/2 decorated Ising chain:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c8i (+ 21 , + 12 ) \u03c8i (+ 12 , \u2212 12 )\nTi =\n.\n(6)\n\u03c8i (\u2212 12 , + 12 ) \u03c8i (\u2212 12 , \u2212 12 )\nSince most applications deal either with rings or very\nlong chains, the boundaries can be identified (sn+1 \u2261 s1 )\nand expression (5) can be written as the trace of a matrix\nproduct:\nZn = Tr(T1 T2 . . . Tn ).\n\n(7)\n\nThis is the most general expression for the partition function of a decorated Ising chain. If the chain has translational symmetry the partition function is expressed in\n\n\f3\nterms of eigenvalues.15 Suppose that the chain is a repetition of identical decorated Ising bonds, then the Ti are\nall the same, so that\nX\nZn = Tr(T1n ) =\n\u03bbni ,\n(8)\ni\n\nwhere the \u03bbi are the eigenvalues of T1 . According\nto Perron's theorem on positive matrices, the eigenvalue \u03bb0 with largest modulus is real, positive and\nnondegenerate.16 This yields the simple but exact result\nfor the free energy per unit cell of the infinite chain:\nf = \u2212kT lim\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nln Zn\n= \u2212kT ln \u03bb0 .\nn\n\n(9)\n\nIf a unit cell of the chain is spanned by p decorated\nbonds instead of one then it is only necessary to combine p transfer matrices into one new transfer matrix\nTe = T1 T2 . . . Tp , with largest eigenvalue \u03bb\u03030 , to be used in\nEqs. (8) and (9), where n is to be replaced by n/p. This\nsituation arises, for example, when the local easy axes on\nthe Ising ions are not parallel but canted with respect to\neach other.\nThe solution in terms of transfer matrices, Eq. (7),\nis not limited to decorated spin-1/2 Ising chains. It is\nvalid for chains having Ising spins of any multiplicity or\na combination of Ising spins with different multiplicities,\nin which case the dimension of the transfer matrix is different from two by two. Another advantage of the transfer matrix method is that it can be readily extended to\ninclude next-nearest-neighbor bonds between the Ising\nspins. To this end, the transfer matrix has to be enlarged so that it does not jump from one Ising spin to\nthe next, but from one pair of Ising spins to the next\npair.15\n\nB.\n\nDy 3+ as Ising spin\n\nWe are interested in this paper in molecular chains or\nrings that can be described by a decorated Ising model.\nThis means that their low-energy spectrum can be modeled to satisfactory accuracy by an effective Hamiltonian\nthat has the properties described in Section II A. It has\nbeen noted there that the composition of the decorating\nunit is basically arbitrary and we need therefore not consider the properties of that part. Instead, our attention\ngoes here to the molecular realization of the Ising spin [si\nin Eq. (1)]. We focus on Dy 3+ because this ion is used\nin the two examples studied below, but the discussion\napplies equally well to several other trivalent lanthanides\nand also to some transition metal ions.\nIt is known that lanthanide ions in a coordination environment are often well described by crystal field theory\napplied to the ground |LSJi level. One assumes that\nJ, L, and S remain good quantum numbers. Dy 3+ is a\nKramers ion that belongs to the second half of the lanthanide series, whose ground level is 6H15/2 (f 9 ), with\n\nassociated Land\u00e9 factor g = 4/3. This multiplet splits\ninto eight Kramers doublets by the crystal field perturbation (except for high-symmetric environments belonging\nto the T , O, or K point groups, which split the multiplet\nin less than eight levels). It will be useful to view each\nKramers doublet as an effective spin-1/2 with its own gfactors (3 in number) and corresponding magnetic axes.\nFor example, take the Kramers doublet |MJ = \u00b115/2i\n(of the 6H15/2 level), quantized with respect to the z axis.\nIts g factors are gz = 2(4/3)(15/2) = 20 and gx = gy = 0.\nIf the action of the crystal field on Dy 3+ is such that\nthe lowest Kramers doublet is separated from the next\none by an energy that is large compared to the energy\nof interaction with the magnetic field and the exchange\ninteraction with neighboring ions, we can omit all excited Kramers doublets from the Hamiltonian and keep\nonly the lowest doublet. In this way Dy 3+ is described\nby a spin of 1/2 and every interaction in which it takes\npart enters the Hamiltonian as a linear combination of\nthe three spin operators sx , sy , and sz .17 If we now want\nDy 3+ to be an Ising spin, defined by the first commutation relation in Eq. (2), it is clear that only one of these\nspin components, say sz or simply s, may actually appear\nin the Hamiltonian. In other words, there must be no interaction that creates an off-diagonal matrix element between the two components of the Kramers doublet. This\ncan be shown to be true with high accuracy if the lowest\nKramers doublet is |MJ = \u00b115/2i.\nThe two interactions of importance here are the Zeeman interaction with the magnetic field and the exchange interaction with other magnetic ions. The Zeeman Hamiltonian follows directly from the g factors of\nthe Kramers doublet (vide supra), and is\n\u2212 \u03bcB gz sz Bz ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere Bz is the z component of the applied magnetic\nfield. Note that the field may be applied in any direction,\nbut it is only the z component that interacts with the\nKramers doublet because gx = gy = 0. The vanishing\nof gx and gy in |MJ = \u00b115/2i follows from the selection\nrule stating that a vector operator (the magnetic moment\nin this case) cannot connect states for which MJ differs\nby more than one unit. We will sometimes refer to the\nz axis as the anisotropy axis, to stress that it is the only\nmagnetic axis with nonvanishing g factor.\nTo evaluate the effect of exchange interaction, we\nmust first take a closer look at the composition of the\nKramers doublet. In terms of the Russel-Saunders states\n|MS i|ML i we have\n| + 15/2i = | + 5/2i| + 5i\n| \u2212 15/2i = | \u2212 5/2i| \u2212 5i.\n\n(11)\n\nIn a basic (super)exchange process between two magnetic centers, one electron of each center takes part. If\nwe look at one center, the process removes an electron\nwith certain spin projection (up or down) and puts it\n\n\f4\nback on the center either with the same or with opposite spin projection.18 This gives rise to the selection rule\n\u2206MS = 0, \u00b11. If the exchange interaction is to connect\nboth components of the Kramers doublet in Eq. (11), at\nleast five successive processes are needed, for \u2206MS = \u00b15.\nIn other words, not one but five electron spins have to be\nflipped to connect | + 15/2i with | \u2212 15/2i. If the basic\nexchange process (i.e. the one for which \u2206MS = 0, \u00b11)\noccurs in, say, kth order19 of perturbation theory then\nan off-diagonal matrix element between the two components can only appear in (5k)th order of perturbation\ntheory. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the offdiagonal matrix element is negligibly small compared to\nthe diagonal matrix elements (\u2206MS = 0) so that the effect of exchange interaction on the Kramers doublet is\naccurately described by the sz spin operator only.\nNote that we derived the selection rule for exchange\ninteraction on the basis of the spin quantum number MS\nonly, without paying attention to the angular momentum\nquantum number ML , although ML changes even more\nthan MS between the states of the Kramers doublet (11).\nThe existence and precise form of a selection rule for\nML depends on the spatial symmetry of the exchange\nproblem under consideration. \u2206ML is therefore not as\nuseful as \u2206MS for predicting the vanishing of certain\nmatrix elements of exchange interaction. Note however\nthat, even in the lowest symmetry, there is a maximum\nto the amount that ML can change in the basic exchange\nprocess described in the previous paragraph: within the\nf orbitals, a one-electron process can bring about at most\na change of \u2206ML = \u00b16. So we would have, in general,\nthat a basic exchange process can induce the following\nchanges in a lanthanide state:\n\u2206MS = 0, \u00b11\n|\u2206ML | \u2264 6.\n\n(12)\n\nThus at least two steps of this kind are needed to bridge\n\u2206ML = \u00b110, but at least five are needed to bridge\n\u2206MS = \u00b15. So in this case, the selection rule of MS\ngives the stronger result and leads to the conclusions-\nreached in the last paragraph-on the matrix elements\nof exchange interaction in the Kramers doublet (11).\nWe can now derive the precise form of that part of the\neffective Hamiltonian that refers to the exchange interaction between a Dy 3+ ion [with ground state (11)] and\nanother magnetic center. We consider two cases, which\nwe shall encounter in the examples in Sections III and\nIV: in the first case the other center is another Dy 3+\nion; in the second case the other center is an ion with\nan isotropic spin moment S. Consider first the exchange\ninteraction with another Dy 3+ ion. We assume that the\nsecond Dy 3+ has the same property of uniaxiality as the\nfirst one and that it also shares all other relevant properties discussed in the previous paragraphs. Then both\nions are represented by a spin-1/2 doublet with a local\nanisotropy axis \u1e91i (i = 1 , 2) and we already know that\nthe effect of exchange interaction in each doublet is proportional to szi . Therefore the exchange Hamiltonian is\n\nnecessarily of the form\n\u2212 Jsz1 sz2 ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere it is understood that the first spin belongs to ion\n1 and the second to ion 2. Note that \u1e911 and \u1e912 need not\nbe parallel with each other.\nAs a second case, consider the interaction between\nDy 3+ (anisotropy axis \u1e911 ) and an isotropic spin S2 .\nThe latter may typically be a transition metal ion with\nquenched orbital momentum. We found that the exchange processes that contribute do not change the spin\nprojection on the Dy 3+ ion (\u2206MS1 = 0, quantization\naxis \u1e911 ), and that this result is independent of the exchange partner. It is also known that every exchange\nprocess commutes with the total spin (the matrix elements involved are spin-independent matrix elements\nof kinetic, potential, and Coulomb energy18 ), so that\n\u2206MS1 + \u2206MS2 = 0. It follows then that \u2206MS2 = 0, or,\nthe exchange Hamiltonian commutes with the z1 component of S2 . The simplest expression compatible with this\nrequirement is\n\u2212 Jsz1 Sz1 ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere s naturally represents Dy 3+ and S represents S2 .\nThe interaction is of Ising form with the anisotropy axis\nof Dy 3+ as Ising axis. Note that, when S2 > 1/2, higher\npowers of Sz1 may enter the Hamiltonian. Considering exchange interaction as a perturbation however, one\ncan usually assume that the lowest-order contribution,\nEq. (14), is the leading term.\nThere are other cases conceivable, for example dipoledipole interaction between the moment of Dy 3+ and a\nneighboring moment. One will always find, as above, that\nthe Hamiltonian is a product of sz (belonging to Dy 3+ )\nand a part that belongs to the other ion and whose form\ndepends on the kind of the other ion and on the details\nof the interaction.\nWe have now obtained that a Dy 3+ ion, if its ground\nstate is |MJ = \u00b115/2i, fairly well separated from excited\nstates, interacts with the magnetic field and with neighboring ions as an Ising spin-1/2, in the sense that the interaction is always proportional to sz , as expressed in the\nEqs. (10), (13), and (14). This means that a chain-like\nmolecular structure having Dy 3+ ions of this kind at regular positions in the chain would meet the requirements\nof a decorated Ising chain, given in part by Eqs. (1) and\n(2). It remains of course to be shown that |MJ = \u00b115/2i\ncan indeed be the ground state of a coordinated Dy 3+\nion in a polynuclear complex.\nAt first sight, this seems rather unlikely. |MJ =\n\u00b115/2i is an eigenstate of cylindrical symmetry. Within\nlanthanide f n states, the crystal field is effectively\ncylindrical if there is, at least, an eightfold rotation\naxis (C8 ) or rotation-inversion axis (S8 ).20 S8 symmetry has been obtained, for example, in mononuclear bis(phtalocyaninato) sandwich complexes of the\nlanthanides.21 Even when such high symmetry is at-\n\n\f5\ntained, the ground state is not necessarily the cylindrical doublet with highest |MJ | value.21 Apart from that,\nthe symmetry of the coordination sphere of a lanthanide\nion in a polynuclear, possibly heterometallic, complex\nor chain is usually much lower or even completely absent. Such is the case for the two examples considered\nin this paper. On the basis of symmetry alone, there is\nthus no reason to expect |MJ = \u00b115/2i to be an eigenstate, let alone the ground state. Nevertheless, recent\nab initio calculations have revealed the unexpected result that the ground state of several low-symmetry complexes of Dy 3+ is very close to |MJ = \u00b115/2i.7,8,22\u201324\nThey used the multiconfigurational, wavefunction-based\nCASSCF/RASSI-SO method, to obtain accurate wavefunctions for several of the lowest Kramers doublets. Calculation of the principal g factors of these states gives an\nindication of their composition. It was found in several\ncases that the ground doublet has gz close to, but lower\nthan 20, and gx and gy close to 0. This corresponds to a\ndoublet mainly composed of |MJ = \u00b115/2i.\nWith evidence of ab initio calculations it is thus possible to identify Dy 3+ in certain coordination environments as an Ising spin-1/2 (to a good approximation).\nWe will use this information to identify the compounds\nin Sections III and IV as decorated Ising chains (or rings).\nTo conclude this section we remark that one cannot deduce from the vanishing of two g factors alone\nthat a Kramers doublet will behave as an Ising spin.\nIt will, of course, in its interaction with the magnetic\nfield [Eq. (10)], but this will not, in general, be true\nfor the exchange interaction. Take again the example\nof Dy 3+ , supposing the ground state is the Kramers\ndoublet |MJ = \u00b17/2i. It is perfectly uniaxial because\ngx = gy = 0 and gz = 9 13 . A closer look at the expansion of |MJ = \u00b17/2i in terms of the Russel-Saunders\nstates |ML i|MS i shows, however, that the selection rules\nin Eq. (12) permit a matrix element to exist between\n|+7/2i and |\u22127/2i, therefore introducing non-Ising terms\n(i.e., sx and sy ) in the same order of perturbation theory\nas the Ising term in the exchange Hamiltonian.\nC.\n\nNature of the eigenstates and level crossings\n\nThere exists a similarity between the spectra of the\ndecorated and undecorated Ising chains at which we\nwant to take a closer look here. We suppose infinite,\nperiodic chains, or periodic, even-membered rings (In\nodd-membered rings spin-frustration complicates the picture). We also limit ourselves to chains with Ising spins\nof 1/2.\nThe undecorated, or simple, Ising chain in a magnetic\nfield B parallel with the z axis is given by Eq. (1) and\n\u0125i = \u2212Jsi si+1 \u2212 \u03bcB gsi B,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere si is the z component of si (si = \u00b11/2). We assume, without loss of generality, B \u2265 0. The eigenstates\nof the chain are spin configurations like (\u2191\u2191\u2193\u2191\u2193 . . . ), etc.\n\nOf the 2n eigenstates only two distinct ones can be the\nground state: the ferromagnetic (F) and the antiferromagnetic (AF):\nF : (\u2191\u2191\u2191\u2191 . . .) if J > 0 or J < 0 and \u03bcB gB > |J|,\nAF : (\u2191\u2193\u2191\u2193 . . .) if J < 0 and \u03bcB gB < |J|.\n(16)\nWhen B = 0 time-reversal symmetry makes every state\ndegenerate with the state formed by flipping all the spins.\nThis degeneracy is meant to be implied in (16), where\nonly one of two states is shown in each case. Only the two\nAF states remain degenerate when B 6= 0. When J < 0\na ground state level crossing occurs from AF to F when\nB is increased. At the point of crossing (\u03bcB gB = |J|)\nthe two AF states are degenerate together with all states\nderived from an AF state by flipping one or more downspins up. However, no other state than AF or F can\nbe the ground state at any other value of B. Thus the\nground state of the Ising chain is either F or AF, and\nthey are degenerate, together with an infinite number of\nother states, at the crossing point.\nWe now decorate the Ising bonds with identical but arbitrary units to obtain a periodic decorated Ising chain.\nThe spectrum is given by Eq. (3). Since the chain is\nperiodic, the spectrum of the individual units \u0125i is independent of i and the energies may be written as \u03b5k , with\nk ranging over the eigenstates of \u0125i . There are four sets of\n\u03b5k : \u03b5k (\u2191\u2191), \u03b5k (\u2191\u2193), \u03b5k (\u2193\u2191), and \u03b5k (\u2193\u2193), in an obvious notation. Notice that the eigenstates of this chain can still\nbe classified according to the configuration of the Ising\nspins: (\u2191\u2191\u2193\u2191\u2193 . . . ) etc., which follows from the fact that\nall the si and \u0124 form a commuting set of observables.\nAn interesting question is whether the same rules hold\nfor the ground state of the decorated Ising chain as did\nfor the simple Ising chain. The answer is yes; the ground\nstate is either F or AF (referring to the Ising spin configuration) and a crossing between them is possible, with\nthe same number and kind of degenerate states as in the\nsimple Ising chain. To show this, we have to consider\nonly the lowest eigenstate belonging to each of the 2n\npossible Ising spin configurations. In these states every\nunit is in its lowest possible state for the given orientation\nof the neighboring Ising spins: \u03b51 (s, s0 ) (we assume this\nenergy to be nondegenerate), so that the total energy of\nthe chain state is\nE = n\u2191\u2191 \u03b51 (\u2191\u2191)+n\u2193\u2193 \u03b51 (\u2193\u2193)+n\u2193\u2191 \u03b51 (\u2193\u2191)+n\u2191\u2193 \u03b51 (\u2191\u2193), (17)\nwhere n\u2191\u2191 denotes the number of pairs of neighboring\nIsing spins that are both spin up, etc. For example, in\nthe F configuration in Eq. (16), n\u2191\u2191 = n (periodic boundary conditions are assumed), while in the AF configuration, n\u2191\u2191 = 0. The eigenstates we have just described,\nwith energy (17), are in an obvious one-to-one correspondence with the eigenstates of the simple Ising chain. The\nground state is found by minimizing (17) with respect to\n\n\f6\nthe nss0 , under the restrictions\nn\u2191\u2191 + n\u2193\u2193 + n\u2193\u2191 + n\u2191\u2193 = n\nn\u2193\u2191 = n\u2191\u2193 .\n\n(18)\n\nThe first relation states that the total number of Ising\nspins (or, equivalently, unit cells) is n. The second relation follows from the fact that, in a cyclic spin configuration, every \u2193\u2191 pair must eventually be followed by a\n\u2191\u2193 pair, possibly after a number of \u2191\u2191 pairs. Another restriction is that whenever both n\u2191\u2191 and n\u2193\u2193 are not zero,\nn\u2193\u2191 [and by Eq. (18) also n\u2191\u2193 ] must be at least one. Using\n(18) we can rewrite Eq. (17) as\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\nE = n\u2191\u2191 \u03b51 (\u2191\u2191) \u2212 [\u03b51 (\u2191\u2193) + \u03b51 (\u2193\u2191)]\n2\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n(19)\n+ n\u2193\u2193 \u03b51 (\u2193\u2193) \u2212 [\u03b51 (\u2191\u2193) + \u03b51 (\u2193\u2191)]\n2\nn\n+ [\u03b51 (\u2191\u2193) + \u03b51 (\u2193\u2191)],\n2\nwhere we see that only the average [\u03b51 (\u2191\u2193) + \u03b51 (\u2193\u2191)]/2 of\nthe \"antiparallel\" energies enters the equation. The last\nterm is a constant and can be discarded for the purpose\nof relative energy considerations.\nWe can now derive the values of n\u2191\u2191 and n\u2193\u2193 for the\nground state of the chain, keeping in mind that \u03b51 (s, s0 )\nis a function of the magnetic field B. Suppose then,\nfirst, that B = 0. Time reversal symmetry asserts that\n\u03b51 (\u2191\u2191) = \u03b51 (\u2193\u2193) and \u03b51 (\u2191\u2193) = \u03b51 (\u2193\u2191). It is simple to see\nthat, depending on the relative ordering of \u03b51 (\u2191\u2191) and\n\u03b51 (\u2191\u2193), E is minimal in the F configuration (n\u2191\u2191 = n or\nn\u2193\u2193 = n; n\u2191\u2193 = n\u2193\u2191 = 0 ) when \u03b51 (\u2191\u2191) < \u03b51 (\u2191\u2193) or in\nthe AF configuration (n\u2191\u2191 = n\u2193\u2193 = 0; n\u2191\u2193 = n\u2193\u2191 = n/2)\nwhen \u03b51 (\u2191\u2191) > \u03b51 (\u2191\u2193) (we exclude the possibility of equality of both energies from the discussion; \u03b51 (\u2191\u2191) = \u03b51 (\u2191\u2193)\nwould correspond, in the simple Ising chain (15), with\nJ = 0). When B 6= 0, time reversal symmetry is not operative, and we have, in general, four different energies\n\u03b51 (s, s0 ). The equation (19) shows that the configuration that minimizes E is determined by the sign of the\ntwo terms in round brackets; if both are positive, then\nn\u2191\u2191 = n\u2193\u2193 = 0 (AF configuration); if at least one of them\nis negative, then either n\u2191\u2191 = n or n\u2193\u2193 = n (F configuration), depending on whether respectively \u03b51 (\u2191\u2191) or \u03b51 (\u2193\u2193)\nis lower.\nFinally, the magnetic field can induce a transition from\nthe AF to an F ground state configuration, say with all\nIsing spins up. This happens when\n\u03b51 (\u2191\u2191) =\n\n1\n[\u03b51 (\u2191\u2193) + \u03b51 (\u2193\u2191)],\n2\n\n(20)\n\nand \u03b51 (\u2191\u2191) < \u03b51 (\u2193\u2193). At this point, the ground state\nconfigurations are all those for which {n\u2193\u2193 = 0, n\u2191\u2191 =\n0, 2, 4, . . . , n}, exactly the same as in the simple Ising\nchain.\nWe find thus a complete analogy between the simple\nand the decorated Ising chain as far as the ground state\nIsing spin configuration is concerned. The only possible\n\nconfigurations are the fully antiferromagnetically aligned\nand the fully ferromagnetically aligned configurations.\nNo \"intermediate\" configuration can be the ground state.\nThe only exception is the crossing point between AF and\nF, where there is a high degeneracy of configurations.\nThese conclusions are independent of the nature of the\ndecorating unit.\nAlthough the decorated Ising model predicts that the\nAF and F ground states are both doubly degenerate (in\nzero field), this degeneracy is not a result of the spatial\nsymmetry: in the cyclic group Cn , the two AF components combine into irreducible representations (irreps) A\nand B, while the two F components transform as two A\nirreps. Introduction of neglected terms in the Hamiltonian, that destroy the Ising property, could split these\nground state components.\nThe decorated Ising chain affords two new kinds of\nground state level crossings, not present in the simple\nIsing chain. The first of these is the transition between\none F configuration of the Ising spins and the other:\n(\u2191\u2191\u2191\u2191, . . .) \u2194 (\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193, . . .). This transition takes place\nwhen \u03b51 (\u2191\u2191) = \u03b51 (\u2193\u2193). This level crossing, induced by\nthe magnetic field, can for example be encountered in\nfrustrated Ising-Heisenberg chains.25 A second kind of\nnew ground state transition arises from the crossing of\nlevels within a decorating unit. A ground state crossing\ncan result in which the Ising spin configuration remains\nthe same but the state corresponding to \u03b51 (s, s0 ) crosses\nwith the state corresponding to \u03b52 (s, s0 ). More precisely\nthis happens in the F configuration when \u03b51 (\u2191\u2191) = \u03b52 (\u2191\u2191)\nand in the AF configuration when either \u03b51 (\u2191\u2193) = \u03b52 (\u2191\u2193)\nor \u03b51 (\u2193\u2191) = \u03b52 (\u2193\u2191), or both. The previous paragraphs\nhave shown that we do not need to consider configurations other than F and AF for the ground state.\nLevel crossings are usually connected with the presence\nof good quantum numbers. For the Ising-type crossings,\nthe relevant conserved quantities are the n Ising spins\n{si }. The crossing of energy levels within the decorating\nunit should be associated with a conserved variable that\nis internal to that unit, much the same as in isolated\nmolecules. In Section III we will encounter an example\nwhere both transitions-Ising type and internal type-\noccur in a magnetic field.\n\nD.\n\nMagnetization of powder samples\n\nIn the following sections we will be comparing our theoretical results with measurements performed on powder\nsamples of the crystalline compounds. In this section we\nconsider the powder averaging of magnetization for the\nexample of the simple Ising chain.\nLet \u03b8 and \u03c6 be the polar angles of the magnetic field\nvector with respect to a molecular reference frame, then\nthe free energy is a function of \u03b8, \u03c6, and the strength of\nthe field, B: f (\u03b8, \u03c6, B). The projection of the magneti-\n\n\f7\n0.5\n\nzation on the field direction \u00eaB is\n\u2202f (\u03b8, \u03c6, B)\n\u00eaB * M(\u03b8, \u03c6, B) = \u2212\n.\n\u2202B\n\n(21)\n\nAveraging over one hemisphere gives the powder magnetization\nZ 2\u03c0 Z \u03c0/2\n\u2202f (\u03b8, \u03c6, B)\n1\n\u2212\nM (B) =\nsin \u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6. (22)\n2\u03c0 0\n\u2202B\n0\nLet us see how the powder averaging affects the magnetization curve for a simple Ising chain. Take a spin-1/2 infinite antiferromagnetic Ising chain with anisotropy axes\nparallel with each other and with the z axis, and uniaxial g-factors (gx = gy = 0 and gz \u2261 g). This could for\nexample be realized by a chain of identical Dy 3+ units\n(see Section II B). The Hamiltonian is given by Eq. (1),\nsubstituting\n\u0125i = \u2212Jsi si+1 \u2212 \u03bcB gsi B cos \u03b8,\n\nMz\ng \u039cB\n\nsinh[b cos \u03b8/2T ]\n\n0.3\n0.2\n\nT \u0087 0.01 K\nT \u0087 0.1 K\n\n0.1\n\nT \u0087 0.3 K\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\nb cosH\u0398L HKL\n\nFIG. 3.

The step-like\nappearance of Mz is associated with the ground state\ncrossing that occurs at b cos \u03b8 = |j|. At that point, the\nantiferromagnetic ground state (or rather ground state\nIsing doublet) is replaced by the ferromagnetic state (all\nspins up). Consequently, the magnetization jumps from\nzero to the saturation value of 0.5, as seen in Fig. 3.\nThe magnetization of a powder sample of the same Ising\nchain is shown in Fig. 4. Before the crossing point, M\nbehaves qualitatively the same as Mz . After the crossing\npoint however, M is seen to reach only slowly its saturation value, which is half of the saturation value of Mz ,\nviz. 0.25.

In Fig. 4, this limiting curve is very closely\napproximated by the curve at T = 0.01 K. Clearly, the\nsharp step of Mz transforms in the powder to the concave\nform displayed by M . This is understood from the fact\nthat, in a powder, for a given field b > |j|, there is always\na fraction of molecules that is not magnetized (in the\nsense that they are in the antiferromagnetic ground state)\nbecause they are oriented so with respect to the field, that\nb cos \u03b8 < |j| (see Fig. 3). The powder saturates only when\nevery molecule is fully magnetized, and this happens only\nfor b \u2192 \u221e. Therefore, M (at 0 K) does not abruptly\nsaturate at the crossover point, but increases slowly to\nsaturation.\n\n\f8\nE.\n\nCorrections for the contribution of excited\nKramers doublets\n\nIn deriving the exchange Hamiltonian in Section II B\nwe assumed that only the lowest Kramers doublet on\nDy 3+ took part. This is certainly a good approximation\nwhen the gap between the lowest and the second-lowest\nKramers doublet is much larger then the strength of the\nexchange interaction. However, the excited Kramers doublets often have to be taken into account to a certain degree of approximation if a comparison with experimental\ndata on susceptibility and magnetization is desired. The\ncrystal field splitting of the 6H15/2 level is of the order of\nkT at room temperature. This gives rise to two effects:\n(i) a thermal population of excited Kramers doublets,\nand (ii) a modification of the lowest Kramers doublet as\na function of the applied magnetic field by interaction\nwith the excited doublets.\nEffect (i) is mainly visible in the temperature dependence of \u03c7T , where \u03c7 is the powder magnetic susceptibility: for a single Dy 3+ center, \u03c7T increases monotonically with increasing temperature, from the value of the\nground doublet at 0 K to the saturation value of 6H15/2 at\nhigher temperatures. Effect (ii) gives rise to temperatureindependent paramagnetism (TIP). It is visible at temperatures sufficiently low so that only the ground doublet\nis occupied. It contributes a linear increase of \u03c7T with\nT and a linear increase of the magnetization M with the\napplied field B.\nIn the simplest approximation, the contribution of the\nexcited Kramers doublets to the magnetic properties of\nthe chain is equal to the contribution they have to the\nproperties of the single, isolated Dy 3+ ion in the same ligand environment it has in the chain. Let \u03c7DIC and MDIC\ndenote susceptibility and magnetization derived from the\ndecorated Ising chain model, and let \u03c7Dy denote the susceptibility of the Dy 3+ center and \u03bc0Dy B the magnetic\nmoment induced by B in the ground doublet of the Dy 3+\ncenter, then the corrected properties are (supposing one\nDy 3+ ion per unit cell)\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03c7T = \u03c7DIC T + \u03c7Dy T \u2212 \u03c7Dy T T =0 ,\n(26a)\nM = MDIC + \u03bc0Dy B.\n\n(26b)\n\nThe last equation assumes that only the ground doublet\nof Dy 3+ is occupied. This is correct at the temperature at which magnetization curves are usually recorded\n(e.g., 2 K). If necessary, corrections due to other magnetic ions can be added in the same way. \u03c7Dy and\n\u03bc0Dy can be obtained from multiconfigurational ab initio\ncalculations7,8,22,23 , or, in oligonuclear complexes, experimentally by replacing certain magnetic ions with diamagnetic ions.26\nThe equations (26) are evidently correct in the limit\nof vanishing exchange interactions. The assumption we\nmake is that the exchange interactions are sufficiently\nsmall for these corrections to remain valid. A more ac-\n\nFIG. 5. Scheme of one unit cell (black) of the [DyCuMoCu]\u221e\nchain, showing type of exchange interactions and labeling of\nexchange constants. See Ref. 7 for the complete molecular\nstructure.\n\ncurate approach should take into consideration the fact\nthat the excited Kramers doublets also participate in the\nexchange interaction with neighbors. This is however out\nof the scope of the decorated Ising model.\nIII. [DyCuMoCu]\u221e POLYMER AS\nISING-HEISENBERG CHAIN\n\nWe now turn our attention to two actual examples of\ndecorated Ising models based on Dy 3+ : a chain, treated\nin this section, and a four-ring treated in the following section. The problem is approached as follows: the\nHamiltonian for the chain in a magnetic field is formulated, with the help of the considerations in Section II B.\nValues of the g factors of the magnetic ions are taken directly from ab initio calculations, reported elsewhere.7,8\nThis leaves the exchange coupling constants as parameters of the model, to be fitted by comparison with experimental magnetization and susceptibility data. (In Section IV, the direction of the anisotropy axis contributes\none extra parameter.)\nThe [DyCuMoCu] chain was recently synthesized and\ndetails of its chemical composition and structure are\ngiven in Ref. 7. The crystal structure was found to consist\nof parallel linear chains each made of [DyCuMoCu] unit\ncells. Fig. 5 shows how the metal ions are connected by\nligand bridges. Multiconfigurational CASSCF/RASSISO calculations have been performed on each of the four\nmetal ions in their ligand environment, suitably disconnected from the rest of the chain (details of the calculations can be found in Ref. 7 and the accompanying Supplementary Information). Most important for us is that\nthe Dy 3+ center was found to have a ground Kramers\ndoublet, separated by 141 cm\u22121 from the second doublet, and characterized by complete uniaxial anisotropy:\nDy3+ :\n\ngz = 19.6,\n\ngx = 0,\n\ngy = 0.\n\n(27)\n\n(Actually gx and gy were calculated about 0.03, which\nis small enough to be ignored.) The value of gz = 19.6\nshows that this doublet is only slightly perturbed from\nthe |MJ = \u00b115/2i doublet of the 6H15/2 level, the latter having gz = 20. Together with the fact that the\nenergy gap to the second Kramers doublet is about ten\ntimes larger than the exchange interaction (as we will\nfind later), these results indicate that the Dy 3+ ion will\nbehave as an Ising spin, as described in Section II B. As\n\n\f9\na side-note we may add that the total splitting of the\n6\nH15/2 level was calculated to be 560 cm\u22121 , which is indeed of the order of room-temperature kT (see Section\nII E).\nBoth Cu 2+ (d9 ) and Mo 5+ (d1 ) have a spin = 1/2,\norbitally nondegenerate ground state, well separated (>\n15000 cm\u22121 ) from higher states. The two Cu 2+ ions in\nthe unit cell reside in almost identical environments7 and\nhave therefore virtually the same properties. The calculated g factors are tetragonal: gk = 2.33, g\u22a5 = 2.07 for\nCu 2+ and gk = 2.00, g\u22a5 = 1.95 for Mo 5+ . To avoid\nunnecessary complications we will regard these ions as\nisotropic spins with root-mean-square g factors\nCu2+ :\n\ngCu = 2.16,\n\nMo5+ :\n\ngMo = 1.97.\n\nThis approximation will not have important consequences for the magnetic properties, which are largely\ndominated by the high Dy 3+ moment anyway.\nWe introduce exchange interaction between metal\nions directly connected by ligand bridges. Dy 3+ interacts with its three neighbors via the Ising Hamiltonian Eq. (14). Interaction between the isotropic spins is\ngiven by the Heisenberg Hamiltonian \u2212Jij Si * Sj . Fig. 5\nshows the exchange configuration, with single bonds representing Ising interaction and double bonds representing\nHeisenberg interaction. Note that we have approximated\nthe Dy-Cu1 and Dy-Cu2 coupling strengths to be equal\n(J1 ), following the approximate local symmetry of the\nDy-Cu pairs.7\nIt is now possible to see that the [DyCuMoCu]\u221e\npolymeric chain is indeed an experimental realization of\nan Ising-Heisenberg chain where the [CuMoCu] trimeric\nHeisenberg units decorate the Dy-Dy bonds and the\nDy 3+ Ising spins separate the [CuMoCu] Heisenberg\ntrimers from each other. The total Hamiltonian in a\nmagnetic field B is then given by Eq. (1) and\nz\nz\n\u0125i (szi , szi+1 ) = \u2212J1 szi SiCu\n\u2212 J2 szi SiMo\n\u2212 J3 SiCu1 * SiMo\n1\nz\n\u2212 J4 SiMo * SiCu2 \u2212 J1 SiCu\nsz\n2 i+1\n\n\u2212 \u03bcB gDy szi Bz \u2212 \u03bcB (gCu SiCu1 + gMo SiMo\n+ gCu SiCu2 ) * B,\n(28)\nwhere szi is shorthand for sziDy and gDy is the gz factor of\nDy 3+ [Eq. (27)]. The z axis is the anisotropy axis of the\nDy 3+ center. We have not specified its direction with\nrespect to the chain axis but this is not important here\nbecause there are no other axes in the problem (the Dy 3+\nanisotropy axes are parallel by translational symmetry\nand we have assumed Cu 2+ and Mo 5+ isotropic). All\nthe spins in Eq. (28) are spins of 1/2.\nThe Hamiltonian exhibits some symmetry. It is rotationally invariant around z, if B is rotated simultaneously. We may therefore restrict B to lie in a plane\nthrough z, say the xz plane. This simplifies calculation\n\n7\nT \u00872K\n\n6\n5\nM\n\n4\nTheory\nExperiment\n\n\u039cB 3\n2\n1\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nB HTL\n\nFIG. 6.

(29)\n\nWe also note that in this case the Zeeman Hamiltonian\ncommutes almost with \u0124. It would commute exactly\nwhen gCu = gMo , for then the last term in Eq. (28) reduces to \u2212\u03bcB gCu Siz Bz .\nWe let the length of the chain go to infinity: n \u2192 \u221e.\nTo solve for the thermodynamic properties we are only\nrequired to find the eigenvalues \u03b5k (s, s0 ) of Eq. (28) (See\nSection II A), with k = 1 . . . 8, corresponding to the 23\npossible states of the [CuMoCu] spin unit. This is done\nby 4 numerical 8\u00d78 matrix diagonalizations, one for each\n(s, s0 ) pair.\nWe can now compare the theory with experiment.\nPowder magnetization (at 2 K) and susceptibility data\nhave been recorded.7 We recall that we have to correct the theoretical curves before comparing with experiment according to Eq. (26). The corrections are provided by the ab initio calculations.7 \u03bc0Dy turns out to be\n0.03 \u03bcB /T; the accompanying correction in Eq. (26b) is\nnever more than 2.5% of M . We ignore this correction.\nWe do however correct \u03c7 as in Eq. (26a).\nClosest agreement with experiment was found for the\nfollowing values of the exchange constants (plots in\nFigs. 6 and 7):\nJ1 = 15.3 cm\u22121 , J2 = \u22128.0 cm\u22121 , J3 = \u22128.3 cm\u22121 ,\nJ4 = 11.8 cm\u22121 .\n(30)\nThese were obtained by a least-squares fit of \u03c7 followed\nby a small manual adjustment to improve the fit of M\nwhile not distorting that of \u03c7 appreciably. (The leastsquares fit of \u03c7 gave J1 = 15.7 cm\u22121 , J2 = \u22128.3 cm\u22121 ,\nJ3 = \u22126.3 cm\u22121 , J4 = 11.8 cm\u22121 .)

Powder magnetic susceptibility of [DyCuMoCu]\u221e .\nThe correction refers to the contribution of excited Kramers\ndoublets, Eq. (26a).\n\nwe know, no data in the literature with which to compare\nthe values in Eq. (30). However, an experimental study is\navailable of a (Dy 3+ , Cu 2+ ) dinuclear complex in which\nthe bridging ligand is the same as in this chain.26 The\nauthors found a ferromagnetic interaction. A superficial\nanalysis of the susceptibility curve in that paper, using\nthe Ising Hamiltonian we use in this paper, yields J1 =\n15 \u00b1 5 cm\u22121 . The other values in (30) are difficult to\nassess. For a discussion of these values and their relation\nwith the molecular structure as well as some evidence\nfrom DFT calculations, we refer to Ref. 7. Certainly, no\nconfidence should be attached to the numbers in decimal\nplaces in (30).\nThe effect of the excited Kramers doublets of Dy 3+ is\nmost clearly seen in the \u03c7T curve (Fig. 8). The curve\nshows a steady increase above 50 K which is not predicted by our decorated Ising model, but is indeed due\nto the thermal population of the Kramers doublets that\noriginate from the 6H15/2 level. We can obtain the ex-\n\nA similar calculation, only including the lowest Kramers\ndoublet of Dy 3+ , with g-factors as in Eq. (27), gives\n13.2 cm3 K mol\u22121 . The correction supplied by the ab initio calculations to account for this difference, is seen to\ncover nicely the high-temperature part of the experimental curve.\nOne notices that \u03c7T shows a slight depression around\n40 K which is not entirely reproduced by the theory. This\nmight indicate a failure of the simple approximation we\nused to include the excited Kramers doublets. Eq. (26a)\nis certainly correct at very high temperatures, when the\nexchange interactions are irrelevant, and at very low temperatures, when the excited Kramers doublets are not\noccupied. If these two regions do not overlap, however,\nthere is a temperature window between, in which excited\ndoublets start to get occupied while exchange interaction\nis not quite negligible yet. In that case, the exchange interaction of the occupied excited doublet(s) with other\nions should be taken into account. Such an interaction\nof antiferromagnetic type could possibly depress \u03c7T as\nobserved.\nWe shall now describe some features of the spectrum of\nthe chain, paying attention to the properties described in\nSection II C. Consider the chain without magnetic field.\nThe exchange parameters in Eq. (30) predict a ground\nstate that has an AF Ising spin configuration. This is in\naccordance with the susceptibility measurements, which\nshow that \u03c7T \u2192 0 as T \u2192 0, requiring a nonmagnetic\nground state (Fig. 8). The ground state is indeed nonmagnetic because |\u03b51 (\u2191\u2193)i is the time-reversed state of\n|\u03b51 (\u2193\u2191)i. Let MS denote an eigenvalue of S z [Eq. (29)]:\nMS \u2208 {\u22123/2, \u22121/2, 1/2, 3/2}. Siz is conserved so MS\nmay be used to label the eigenstates |\u03b5k (s, s0 )i (we may\nleave out the index i because all units of the chain are\nidentical). For the ground state, we find MS = \u22121/2 in\n|\u03b51 (\u2191\u2193)i and MS = 1/2 in |\u03b51 (\u2193\u2191)i.\nSince the ground state is AF, we might expect that in\na magnetic field a crossover will occur to an F ground\nstate. This is indeed what happens. The convex increase\nof M in Fig. 6 points to a flip of the Dy 3+ spins to a\n\n\f11\nT \u00872K\n\n12\n\n\u0398 \u0087 0 HMz L\n\n10\n\nM\n\u039cB\n\n2\n\n\u0398 \u0087 \u03a0\u00904\n\n0\n\n8\npowder\n\n6\n\n-10\n\n2\n\nE Hcm-1 L\n\n4\n\n0\n\n\u0398 \u0087 \u03a0\u00902 HMx L\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n12\n10\nM\n\n8\n\n\u039cB\n\n6\n\n\u0398 \u0087 0 HMz L\n\n4\n\u0398 \u0087 \u03a0\u00902 HMx L\n\n0\n1\n\n1\u00902\n\n-40\n\n-1\u00902\n-50\n\n-3\u00902\n\n2\n\n3\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nB HTL\n\npowder\n\n0\n\nMS\n3\u00902\n\n0\n\n\u0398 \u0087 \u03a0\u00904\n\n2\n\n\u00b6k H--L\n\n-30\n\nFIG. 9.

Eigenvalues of \u0125(s, s0 ) [Eq. (28)] in a magnetic field\nparallel with the z axis (\u03b8 = 0). Circles indicate ground\nstate level crossings. The ground state of the chain is AF\nin zero field (left), switches to F at 0.64 T, and undergoes\nan internal level crossing at 6.3 T, marked by a change of\nthe internal quantum number MS from 1/2 to 3/2. Both\ncrossings can be seen in the \u03b8 = 0 magnetization curve in\nFig. 10. Note that the energy curves appear as straight lines,\nalthough, with the exception of MS = \u00b13/2, they are not\nexactly straight, because the Zeeman Hamiltonian does not\ncompletely commute with the total Hamiltonian. All \u03b5k (\u2191\u2191\n) decrease with increasing field strength because the large\nmagnetic moment of Dy 3+ dominates the smaller magnetic\nmoments of the decorating unit.\n\nFIG. 10. Theoretical magnetization of [DyCuMoCu]\u221e . Same\nas Fig. 9 but at lower temperature and to higher field.\n\nparallel configuration. This is inferred from the value of\nthe magnetization, which approaches 6 \u03bcB at 5 T. The\n[CuMoCu] unit alone can only contribute a maximum of\n(2.16+1.97+2.16)/2 = 3.15 \u03bcB . The strong increase must\ncome from the contribution of the large Dy 3+ moments.\nThe behavior of magnetization along certain directions\nof applied field is shown in Fig. 9. The AF \u2192 F transition\nis most clearly seen when the field is applied along z\n(\u03b8 = 0); the transition occurs below 1 T. After 1 T, Mz\nreaches an approximately constant plateau at \u2248 11 \u03bcB .\nThe saturation value of magnetization in direction 0 \u2264\n\u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0/2 is (19.6 cos \u03b8 + 2.16 + 1.97 + 2.16)/2. This gives\n12.9 \u03bcB for \u03b8 = 0, which shows that Mz has not quite\nreached its maximum at 5 T yet.\nThe positions of level crossings become more sharply\ndefined on lowering the temperature (Fig. 10). Here we\n\nalso see that Mz undergoes a second transition at 6.3 T,\nafter which it reaches saturation. This transition is connected with a level crossing in the [CuMoCu] unit (see\nSection II C) from MS = 1/2 to MS = 3/2, as opposed to\nthe first transition, at 0.64 T, which is of the Ising type,\ndescribed by Eq. (20). The latter is the analogue of the\ntransition in the AF simple Ising chain (Fig. 3), while the\n\"internal\" transition has no such analogue but is unique\nto the decorated Ising chain. The relevant energy level\ndiagram is shown in Fig. 11. Note that, for fields not\nparallel to z (for example, \u03b8 = \u03c0/4 in Fig. 10), MS is\nnot a quantum number and the internal level crossing\nturns into an avoided crossing. This does not apply for\nthe Ising level crossing because the Ising spins are always\nconserved. Only when the field is applied perpendicular\nto z (\u03b8 = \u03c0/2 in Fig. 10) does the AF \u2192 F transition\nnot occur because the Dy 3+ spins do not interact with\nperpendicular fields.\n\n\f12\n40\n\n\u03a7 T Hcm3 K mol-1 L\n\n\u03a7zz T\n30\n\n20\npowder \u03a7T\n10\n\u03a7xx T\n0\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nT HKL\n\nFIG. 12.

The resemblance is clear; the\ndecorated chain is different in the small linear increase of\nM before the transition, and the more linear approach to\nsaturation, which lies at (19.6/2 + 2.16 + 1.97 + 2.16)/2 =\n8.0 \u03bcB . Both are due to TIP interaction in the [CuMoCu]\nunit, the effect of which is most clearly seen in the Mx\ncurve in Fig. 10.\nTo conclude this section we remark that the mentioned\nsimilarity with the magnetization of the simple Ising\nchain is a consequence of the very high magnetic moment\nof the Dy 3+ spins in comparison with the [CuMoCu] unit.\nThe dominance of Dy 3+ is most dramatically shown\nin the components of \u03c7T (Fig. 12).

The Z axis points out of the center of the scheme.\n\nAb initio calculations have been performed in the same\nway as for the [DyCuMoCu] chain.8 From these, we take\nagain the g-factors of the ground doublet of Dy 3+ and\nof the isotropic ground state spin multiplet of Cr 3+ (d3 ,\nS = 3/2):\nDy3+ :\n3+\n\nCr\n\n:\n\ngz = 19.66,\ngCr = 1.97.\n\ngx = 0,\n\ngy = 0,\n\n(32)\n\nThe Dy 3+ Kramers doublet is again very close to the\n|MJ = \u00b115/2i state, permitting the use of the Ising\nmodel. However, the same calculation predicted the second Kramers doublet at 30 cm\u22121 , not very high compared with exchange interaction, which we found in the\nprevious section \u2248 10 cm\u22121 . This should be seen as a\nwarning that our treatment of the excited Kramers doublets as \"innocent\" may not be entirely correct here,\nand thus may lead to discrepancies with experiment.\nIn this respect we must also note that, for such small\nexcitation energies, the results of the ab initio calculations are not always conclusive on the nature of the\nground state Kramers doublet. In the present case, for\ninstance, another set of calculations produced a ground\nstate Kramers doublet on Dy 3+ that is not uniaxial as in\nEq. (32), having relatively large transversal g-factors.8\nThe decorated Ising model would be unusable in this\ncase. We find however that, assuming the axial g-factors\nin Eq. (32), Dy4 Cr4 is an interesting example of a decorated Ising ring, for which qualitative agreement with\nexperimental magnetic properties can be obtained.\nDirect ligand bridges connect each Dy 3+ with two\nneighboring Cr 3+ ions and two neighboring Dy 3+ ions.\n\n\f13\nExchange interaction between these pairs is introduced\n[Eqs (13) and (14)]. The Hamiltonian is then given by\nEq. (1): \u0124 = \u01251 + \u01252 + \u01253 + \u01254 , and\nz\n\nz\n\nz\n\nz\n\ni+1\ni+1\ni+1\nSi i+1 ) \u2212 J2 szi i si+1\n) = \u2212J1 (szi i Sizi + si+1\n\u0125i (szi i , si+1\n\n\u2212 \u03bcB (gDy szi i B zi + gCr Si * B),\n(33)\nwhere szi i denotes the Ising spin-1/2 variable on Dyi and\nSizi denotes the projection of the spin of Cri on the magnetic anisotropy axis of Dyi (for numbering, see Fig 13).\nSimilarly, B zi is the projection of the magnetic field on\nthe anisotropy axis of Dyi . gDy is the gz factor of Dy 3+\n[Eq. (32)].\nAn interesting difference with the [DyCuMoCu] chain\nis that here, in Dy4 Cr4 , the four anisotropy axes zi are\nnot, in general, parallel, a result of point symmetry instead of translational symmetry. The orientation of the\nlocal anisotropy axis on Dy 3+ , being one of the g-tensor\nmain axes, is restricted by the local C2 symmetry to be either parallel with, or orthogonal to the local C2 axis. The\nfirst possibility can be excluded on the basis of the experiment; with the zi pointing radially outwards at each\nDyi , the ground state of the whole molecule is necessarily\nnonmagnetic, because the local moments add up to zero,\nindependent of whether the ground state is F or AF with\nrespect to the Ising spins. The experimental susceptibility measurement however indicates a magnetic ground\nstate (nonzero intercept on the vertical axis in Fig. 14).\nWe must therefore choose the second case and let the\nanisotropy axis on each Dy be orthogonal to the local\nC2 axis and make an angle of \u03b1 with the molecular Zaxis (See Fig. 13). By applying the symmetry elements\nof D2d to one of these anisotropy axes, one obtains the\n\nr\nbi =\n\nother three. When \u03b1 = 0 the four axes are parallel and\npoint in the same direction as Z. We note that the ab\ninitio calculations yielded \u03b1 = 37\u25e6 . We will need some\nflexibility in our model however, so we leave \u03b1 as a parameter that will be determined from comparison with\nexperiment.\nIn terms of the molecular coordinate system, the projections on the local anisotropy axes are a function of\n\u03b1:\nSiz1 = cos(\u03b1)SiZ + sin(\u03b1)SiY\nSiz2 = cos(\u03b1)SiZ + sin(\u03b1)SiX\nSiz3 = cos(\u03b1)SiZ \u2212 sin(\u03b1)SiY\nSiz4 = cos(\u03b1)SiZ \u2212 sin(\u03b1)SiX .\nThe same relations hold for the magnetic field, after replacing Si by B.\nThe fact that only exchange interactions of Ising type\nappear in Eq. (33) makes it possible to find analytical\nsolutions of the eigenvalues and the partition function.\nFrom Eqs. (33) and (34) we see that the part of \u0125i that\ninvolves Si is a projection of Si on the vector\n\u2212 J1 (si \u1e91i + si+1 \u1e91i+1 ) \u2212 gCr \u03bcB B,\n(35)\nwhere \u1e91i is the unit vector along the anisotropy axis of\nDyi (the superscripts zi on si are left out from now on).\nThe vector (35) defines the quantization axis of Si , which\ndepends on the states on the neighboring Dy 3+ sites\n(si , si+1 ). The stronger the coupling (J1 ) with Dy, the\nstronger will be the deviation of the quantization axis\nfrom the direction of B. The eigenvalues of \u0125i are then\n\u03b5iMS (si , si+1 ) = bi MS \u2212 J2 si si+1 \u2212 \u03bcB gDy si B zi , (36)\nwhere MS = \u2212S, . . . , S, and\n\nJ12\n2 B2\n(1 + 4si si+1 cos2 \u03b1) + 2J1 \u03bcB gCr (si B zi + si+1 B zi+1 ) + \u03bc2B gCr\n2\n\nis the length of the vector in Eq. (35). Some remarks\nshould be made on the solutions. Eqs. (37) and (34) (replace Si by B) show that the spectrum in Eq. (36) is not\nthe same for every unit i, as it was in the [DyCuMoCu]\nchain, unless B is applied along the Z axis. This means\nthat also the transfer matrices Ti will be different and\nthat we have to use Eq. (7) instead of Eq. (8) for the\npartition function. A second remark concerns the quantum number MS . The lowest energy in Eq. (36) is always given by MS = \u2212S, but note that the axis to which\nthis quantization refers is not invariant; in particular, it\nchanges with strength and direction of applied field, so\nthat MS does not represent a real conserved quantity that\ncould be responsible for level crossings of the \"internal\"\ntype. Such crossings do not occur in Dy4 Cr4 .\n\n(34)\n\n(37)\n\nWe conclude the solution by finding the partition function Z. Substituting Eq. (36) in Eq. (4) we find\n\u03a8i (si , si+1 ) =\n\nS\nX\n\ne\u2212\u03b2\u03b5iMS\n\nMS =\u2212S\n\n=\n\nsinh[\u03b2bi (2S + 1)/2]\nsinh[\u03b2bi /2]\n\u00d7 exp[\u03b2(J2 si si+1 + \u03bcB gDy si B zi )]\n\nWith Ti as defined in Eq. (6), we obtain the partition\nfunction\nZ = Tr(T1 T2 T3 T4 ).\nLet us now compare the theoretical results with experiment. A great amount of information on the values of the\n\n\f14\n70\n60\n\u03a7 T Hcm3 K mol-1 L\n\nparameters \u03b1, J1 and J2 can be obtained by inspection\nof the powder \u03c7T curve (Fig. 14). The nonzero intercept \u03c7T |T \u21920 = 34.6 cm3 K mol\u22121 indicates a magnetic\nground state.27 Now from the general theory we know\nthat the ground state is either F (\u2191\u2191\u2191\u2191) or AF (\u2191\u2193\u2191\u2193)\nwith respect to the Dy 3+ spins;28 AF is nonmagnetic so\nwe decide that the ground state must be F.\nIncidentally, we can precisely delineate the regions in\nparameter space where the ground state is F or AF:\n\u0011\n\u221a \u0010p\nF (\u2191\u2191\u2191\u2191) : J2 > \u2212 2S\n1 + cos2 \u03b1 \u2212 sin \u03b1 |J1 |,\n\n50\n40\nExperiment\n\n30\n\nwith correction\n20\nwithout correction\nH \u03a7DIC T L\n\n10\n0\n\n(38a)\n\n0\n\n50\n\nThis is a strictly decreasing function of \u03b1 that can be\nused to derive \u03b1 from the experimental value \u03c7T |T \u21920 =\n34.6 cm3 K mol\u22121 , and the knowledge that sgn(J1 ) = \u22121.\nThis gives \u03b1 = 49\u25e6 .\nWe derive values for J1 , J2 , and \u03b1 by a least-squares\nfitting of \u03c7. As before, a correction for the contribution\nof excited Dy 3+ Kramers doublets is provided by the ab\ninitio calculations and applied following Eq. (26). The\nfitting yields\nJ1 = \u22128.9 cm\u22121 ,\n\nJ2 = 5.2 cm\u22121 ,\n\n\u03b1 = 49.2\u25e6 .\n\nThe comparison with experiment is shown in Figs. 14\nand 15. Note that the magnetic properties are reported\nper mole (\u03c7 and \u03c7T ) or per molecule (M ) of Dy4 Cr4 and\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n20\n\n\u03a7 Hcm3 mol-1 L\n\n(38b)\n\n4\n4\nE2\nX\nX\nNA \u03bc2B D\n,\n\u03c7ZZ T |T \u21920 =\nsi +gCr\nSiZ F\nF gDy cos \u03b1\nk\ni=1\ni=1\n(39)\nso \u03c7T |T \u21920 = 13 \u03c7ZZ T |T \u21920 . With the help of Eqs. (34)\u2013\n(37) and the fact that, in the ground state, MS = \u2212S in\nEq. (36), we can evaluate Eq. (39) to find\n\u0012\nNA \u03bc2B\n2\n\u03c7T |T \u21920 =\n4 cos \u03b1 gDy\n3k\n\u00132\n\u221a\n1\n+ sgn(J1 )2 2gCr S \u221a\n.\n1 + cos2 \u03b1\n\n100\n\nT HKL\n\n\u0011\n\u221a \u0010p\nAF(\u2191\u2193\u2191\u2193) : J2 < \u2212 2S\n1 + cos2 \u03b1 \u2212 sin \u03b1 |J1 |.\n\nA second piece of information comes from the increase\nof \u03c7T with increasing temperature. This is partly but\nnot completely due to the occupation of excited Kramers\ndoublets, as one can show by subtracting the contribution of the latter, obtained from the ab initio calculations\n(not shown here). There must still be an antiferromagnetic interaction to explain the increase. Since the Dy 3+\nare already known to be ferromagnetically aligned, the\nonly possibility is that the Cr 3+ spins couple antiferromagnetically with Dy 3+ , or J1 < 0.\nWith this information, we can determine the angle\n\u03b1. At 0 K, \u03c7T is determined by the magnetic moment\nin the ground state only.27,29 In the F (\u2191\u2191\u2191\u2191) state,\n\u03c7XX T |T \u21920 = \u03c7Y Y T |T \u21920 = 0 by symmetry and\n\nTheory\n\nExperiment\n\n15\n\nTheory\nwith correction\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nT HKL\n\nFIG. 14.

A linear corrections of 0.5 \u03bcB /T has been added to the theoretical curve,\naccording to Eq. (26b).\n\nnot per DyCr unit. Note also that sgn(J1 ) = \u22121, that\nJ2 satisfies Eq. (38a), and that \u03b1 agrees with the value\nderived above.\nThe agreement of magnetization curves (Fig. 15) is not\nas good as it was for the [DyCuMoCu]\u221e chain, although\nthe qualitative properties seem to correspond. In particular, we mention the strong linear increase of M at\n\n\f15\nhigher fields (\u2248 2.6 \u03bcB /T), which is due to the gradual\norientation of the Cr 3+ spins to the magnetic field [see\ndiscussion connected with Eq. (35)], and, to a smaller extent, also to the correction of 0.5 \u03bcB /T, a non-negligible\nlinear contribution to magnetization, which is due to the\nlow-lying excited Kramers doublets.\nAs was mentioned before, the discrepancies are not unexpected given a low-lying first excited Kramers doublet\nof Dy 3+ , which could undermine the assumptions underlying the decorated Ising model. Note also that we could\nnot take the ab initio value of 37\u25e6 for \u03b1. Leaving \u03b1 as a\nparameter can be seen as a partial compensation for the\ninaccuracies of the model and the ab initio results.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have shown that the decorated Ising model is\na valid model for the magnetic properties of certain\nlanthanide-containing magnetic compounds, if the crystal field spectrum of the lanthanide ion satisfies certain\nproperties. The most important of these is the requirement of a ground state Kramers doublet with completely\nuniaxial magnetic anisotropy (this statement is simplified, see Section II B for the correct details). It is a remarkable fact that precisely this property has been estab-\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nwillem.vandenheuvel@chem.kuleuven.be\nliviu.chibotaru@chem.kuleuven.be\nM.

Perhaps the best known example is the\nDy3 triangle, where the Ising properties of Dy 3+ were\nused to explain the nature of the ground state.22\nWe have focused on Dy 3+ as lanthanide ion because\nthis is a much-used lanthanide in current synthetic research in molecular magnetism (witness both compounds\nin this paper) and because computational results showing that it meets the requirements for an Ising spin are\navailable. However, there is no reason to assume that the\nfindings are unique to Dy 3+ . We expect that other lanthanides with high momentum (e.g., Er 3+ ) will exhibit\nthe same uniaxial anisotropy in certain ligand environments and that examples of decorated Ising chains based\non lanthanides other than Dy 3+ will be found in the future.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank Liviu Ungur for providing results of the ab\ninitio calculations.
