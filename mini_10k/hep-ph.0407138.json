It will be\nuseful in determining the oscillation parameters, and, in\nfuture, to search for effects of 1-3 mixing [14] and for a\n'tomography' of the Earth (see, e.g. [20, 21]). It might\neven be possible to look for small structures of the density\nprofile [20].\nIn the existing calculations of Earth matter effects (see,\ne.g. [1] - [20]) the density profile is often approximated\nby one, two or several layers (mainly mantle and core)\nwith constant densities or a direct numerical integration\nof the evolution equation is performed. However, the\nemergence of the large mixing MSW solution to the solar\nneutrino problem opens a more efficient approach to the\noscillation effects in the Earth. Indeed, for the LMA parameters, the oscillations of the solar and (lower energy)\nsupernova neutrinos inside the Earth occur in a 'weak'\nregime, where the matter potential V is much smaller\nthan the 'kinetic energy' of the neutrino system, i.e.\nV (x) \u226a\n\n\u2206m2\n.\n2E\n\n(1)\n\n\u221a\nHere V (x) \u2261 2GF Ne (x), GF is the Fermi constant,\nNe (x) is the number density of the electrons, \u2206m2 \u2261\nm22 \u2212 m21 is the mass squared difference, and E is the\nneutrino energy.\nIn this case one can introduce a small parameter\n2EV (x)\n(2)\n\u2206m2\n\u0015 \u0014\n\u0015\n\u0015 \u0014\n\u0014\nNe (x)\n7.7 * 10\u22125 eV2\nE\n*\n,\n*\n= 0.02 *\n10 MeV\nNA\n\u2206m2\n\n\u01eb(x) \u2261\n\nwhere NA is the Avogadro number, and consider an expansion of the oscillation probabilities in \u01eb(x).\n\nIn ref. [23], the \u01eb perturbation theory was formulated in\nthe basis of neutrino mass states \u03bdmass \u2261 (\u03bd1 , \u03bd2 )T . The\noscillation probabilities and the regeneration factor were\ncalculated to first order in \u01eb. The expressions obtained\nare valid for arbitrary density profiles with sufficiently\nlow density (1). They simplify the numerical calculations\nsubstantially and allow to understand in details all features of the oscillation effects. The method reproduced\nimmediately the analytic result obtained in [24] for an approximate but realistic density profile. Similar integral\nexpression for the regeneration factor has been discussed\nin [25].\nSince \u01eb(x) increases with energy, the lowest approximation in \u01eb(x) may not be enough for larger energies.\nFor instance, if E \u2243 50 MeV (possible for SN neutrinos),\nwe find \u01eb(x) \u2243 0.6 at the center of the Earth.\nThe purpose of this paper is to improve on this method\nand obtain accurate formulas which are valid for higher\nenergies. In section 2 the oscillation probabilities are calculated in second order in \u01eb(x) and the convergence of\nthe \u01eb expansion is commented on. In section 3 we suggest an improved perturbation theory which allows one\nto extend the expansion to higher energies. The generalization to three neutrinos is given in section 4 and a brief\nconclusion in section 5.\n\nII.\n\nSECOND ORDER CORRECTIONS TO THE\nOSCILLATION PROBABILITIES\n\nIn this and the following section we consider the mixing\nof two (active) neutrinos \u03bdf = U (\u03b8)\u03bdmass , where \u03bdf \u2261\n(\u03bde , \u03bda )T and \u03bdmass \u2261 (\u03bd1 , \u03bd2 )T are the flavor and mass\nstates, respectively and \u03bda is a linear combination of \u03bd\u03bc\nand \u03bd\u03c4 . U (\u03b8) and \u03b8 are the mixing matrix and mixing\nangle in vacuum. We define the matrix U (\u03b1) as\n\u0013\n\u0012\ncos \u03b1 sin \u03b1\n.\n(3)\nU (\u03b1) \u2261\n\u2212 sin \u03b1 cos \u03b1\n\n\f2\nIn [23] the following expression for the S-matrix in the\nmass eigenstates basis was derived [26]:\n\u0013\n1\n0\nm\n+\n\u2212i\u03c6\n0 e x0 \u2192xf\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\nZ xf\n1\n0\n1\n0\nm\nm\n\u2212\n\u03a5(x)\ndx\n\u2212i\n\u2212i\u03c6\n0 e\u2212i\u03c6x0 \u2192x\n0 e x\u2192xf\nx0\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ xf Z x \u0012\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\nm\nm\nm\n\u03a5(x)\n\u03a5(y)\n\u2212 dx dy\n\u2212i\u03c6\n0 e\u2212i\u03c6y\u2192x\n0 e\u2212i\u03c6x0 \u2192y\n0 e x\u2192xf\nx0\nx0\nS =\n\n\u0012\n\n+*** ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere\n\u03c6m\nx1 \u2192x2 \u2261\n\nZ\n\nx2\n\ndx\u2206m (x)\n\n(5)\n\nx1\n\nis the adiabatic phase difference acquired by the neutrino eigenstates in matter on their trajectory between\ntwo points x1 and x2 . \u2206m (x) is defined as\n\nThe two last terms (proportional to \u01eb2 ) come from the\nfirst order in \u03a5 (term proportional to sin2 \u03b8\u2032 in Eq. (8))\nand the second order in \u03a5 (see Eq. (4)) correspondingly.\nUsing the evolution matrix in the mass state basis (10),\nwe can calculate the amplitudes and probabilities of various transitions. The evolution matrix from the mass\nstates to the flavor states relevant for the solar and SN\nneutrinos equals U S, where U is the vacuum mixing matrix (3). Consequently, the amplitude of the mass-toflavor transition, is given by\nA\u03bdi \u2192\u03bd\u03b1 = U\u03b1j (\u03b8)Sji .\n\n(11)\n\nThe probability of the \u03bd2 \u2192 \u03bde transition, P\u03bd2 \u2192\u03bde =\n|A\u03bd2 \u2192\u03bde |2 = |Uej (\u03b8)Sj2 |2 is then found to be\nZ xf\n1\nP\u03bd2 \u2192\u03bde = sin2 \u03b8 + sin2 2\u03b8 dx V (x) sin \u03c6m\nx\u2192xf\n2\nx\nZ xf Z xf 0\n1\n+ sin2 2\u03b8 cos 2\u03b8 dx dyV (x) V (y) cos \u03c6m\ny\u2192x ,(12)\n4\nx0\nx0\n\nwhere the last term is the \u01eb2 correction. The integrations over x and y can be disentangled. Indeed, writing\n(6)\nm\nm\n\u03c6m\ny\u2192x = \u03c6y\u2192z + \u03c6z\u2192x , where z is an arbitrary point of\nthe\ntrajectory,\nwe\nfind\nin vacuum we obviously have\nZ xf Z xf\nm\n\u2206m2\n(13)\nm\n\u2206 \u2192\u2206\u2261\n.\n(7) x dx x dyV (x) V (y) cos \u03c6y\u2192x =\n0\n0\n2E\n\u00152\n\u00152 \u0014Z xf\n\u0014Z xf\nm\nm\nThe S-matrix in (4) is written as a perturbative expandx V (x) sin \u03c6z\u2192x .\ndx V (x) cos \u03c6z\u2192x +\nx0\nx0\nsion in \u03a5(x) where\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\nThis shows that the second order correction is positive\nsin 2\u03b8\n1 m\n1 0\n01\n2 \u2032\n.

According to (17) the first order correction\nis absent for trajectories with \u03c6m\nx\u0304\u2192xf = \u03c0k, (k = integer) and the second order correction would be zero for\nmaximal vacuum mixing.\nTaking \u2206m \u2248 \u2206 we obtain the useful bound\nI\u223c\n\n2E\n\u2206m2\n\nZ\n\ny(xf )\n\ny(x\u0304)\n\ndyV (y) cos y \u2264\n\n2EVmax\n= \u01ebmax .

It originates\nfrom \u01eb2 term in \u03a5. (The undamped terms are absent\nin the linear term in \u01eb [27].) This could be a problem, because the potential (squared) is integrated over a\nlarge distance without an oscillatory damping, and this\nmight give rise to a large second order term in the expansion. However by a simple partial integration of the\nlast, \u223c V (x)V (y), term in (10) one can see that the undamped integral cancels. We have verified that this also\nhappens in order V 3 for constant potentials. Therefore\nthe \u01eb expansion appears to be well behaved (see also [26]).\n\nIn this case we expect the expansion parameter to be\n\u01eb=\n\n2E(V \u2212 V0 )\n2E\u2206V\n=\n.\n2\n\u2206m\n\u2206m2\n\nThe corresponding results can be immediately obtained\nfrom the original perturbation theory. Indeed, the transition to an average potential V0 is equivalent to consid0\nering the problem in the basis \u03bdm\n= (\u03bd10 , \u03bd20 ), where \u03bdi0\nare the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian in matter with\na constant potential V0 . These states are analogous to\nmass eigenstates in the V0 = 0 theory. Therefore the Smatrix S 0 for (\u03bd10 , \u03bd20 ) follows from the S matrix for mass\neigenstates (10) by the substitution\nV \u2192 \u2206V \u2261 V \u2212 V0 ,\n\n\u03b8 \u2192 \u03b80m ,\n\nIMPROVED PERTURBATION THEORY\n\nAs mentioned before, the accuracy of our expressions\ndecreases for higher densities and energies. However, the\nexpansion parameter can be reduced and therefore the\nexpansion can be improved. This can be achieved by\nconsidering a perturbation around some average potential V0 rather than around the vacuum value V0 = 0 [28].\n\n(20)\n\nwhere \u03b80m is the flavor mixing angle in matter with the\npotential V0 :\n\nand\n\nsin 2\u03b8\nsin 2\u03b80m = p\n1 \u2212 2\u01eb0 cos 2\u03b8 + \u01eb20\n\u01eb0 \u2261\n\n2EV0\n.\n\u2206m2\n\n(21)\n\n(22)\n\nThe adiabatic phase differences generated for the eigenstates traveling in matter with true V are invariant under a shift of the average potential, so that the phases,\n\u03c6m\nxi \u2192xj are unchanged.

For such neutrinos\n\u01eb=0.2 [0.4] in the upper mantle and \u01eb=0.6 [1.2] in the\ncore. Thus, the average is \u01eb0 \u2243 0.4 [0.8]. Without improvement, one expects the accuracy of the computation\nof \u01eb3 \u2243 0.2 [O(1)] in the core; with the improvement it\nis reduced to (\u01eb \u2212 \u01eb0 )3 \u2243 0.01 [0.06]. The optimal V0\ncan be chosen independently for each trajectory inside\nthe Earth.

By choosing a convenient constant average value for the neutrino potential as starting point, the\nprecision can be substantially improved and it is possible\nto reach an accuracy of a few percents even for energies\nnear 70 \u2212 80 MeV. The effective expansion parameter is\na simple integral in eq. (16) (or eq. (29)) together with\neq. (5)) which can be done numerically. The expansion\nallows for a convenient quantitative discussion of various physical effects such as the attenuation effect to the\nremote structures of the density profile or the effect of\nenergy resolution of detectors. We also consider the case\nof three-neutrino mixing.\nThe work of A.N.I. was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF).

In the original version of the\npaper (hep-ph/0404083 v.1) the 'wrong' vacuum phase\nhas been derived and the correct oscillation phase has\nbeen introduced on the \"heuristic\" ground. Its derivation\nis given in later journal version.\n[26] This result may be obtained via ordinary perturbation theory with the Hamiltonian H(x) = diag(0, \u2206) +\nU \u2020 diag(V (x), 0) U = H0 + \u03a5, where H0 is the diagonalized Hamiltonian (MSW solution) at point (x). We would\nlike to stress that only that separation of the Hamiltonian into a non-perturbative (H0 ) and a perturbative (\u03a5)\nparts leads to results where terms proportional to the full\ndistance traveled by neutrinos in matter are absent; this\nis in fact guaranteed by the existence of the MSW solution.\n[27] It is important to recall that \u01eb enters both through V and\nthrough the adiabatic phase \u03c6m .\n[28] Even more general would be an expansion around a suitable potential for which there is a closed analytic form.\nm\n[29] When V \u226a\nq \u2206s \u226a \u2206a then \u2206a \u2243 \u2206a + O(V ) and\n\u2206m\ns \u2243 \u2206s\n\n(cos 2\u03b8 \u2212\n\nV c2\n13 2\n)\n\u2206s\n\n2\n\nV\n+ sin2 2\u03b8 + O(s213 \u2206\n).\na\n\n\f"}
