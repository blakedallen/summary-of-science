For this reason, the topic\nof color superconductivity stirred a lot of interest in recent years [1, 2, 3, 4]. (For reviews on color superconductivity see, for example, Ref. [5].)\nTo form bulk matter inside compact stars, the charge\nneutrality condition as well as \u03b2 equilibrium are required\n[6, 7, 8]. This induces mismatch between the Fermi surfaces of the pairing quarks. It is clear that the Cooper\npairing will be eventually destroyed with the increase of\nmismatch. However, there are no certain answer on the\ntrue ground state of neutral cold-dense quark matter with\na moderate mismatch.\nWithout the constraint from the charge neutrality condition, the system may exhibit a first order phase transition from the color superconducting phase to the normal\nphase when the mismatch increases [9]. It was also found\nthat the system can experience a spatial non-uniform\nLOFF (Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fudde-Ferrell) state [10, 11]\nin a certain window of moderate mismatch.\nThe charge neutrality condition plays an essential role\nin determining the ground state of the neutral system. If\nthe charge neutrality condition is satisfied globally, and\nalso if the surface tension is small, the mixed phase will\nbe favored [12]. It is difficult to precisely calculate the\nsurface tension in the mixed phase, thus in the following,\nwe would like to focus on the homogeneous phase when\nthe charge neutrality condition is required locally.\nIt was found that homogeneous neutral cold-dense\nquark matter can be in the gapless 2SC (g2SC) phase [13]\nor gapless CFL (gCFL) phase [14], depending on the fla-\n\n\u2217 TKYNT-05-8\n\u2020 huang@nt.phys.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp\n\nvor structure of the system. The gapless state resembles\nthe unstable Sarma state [15, 16]. However, under a natural charge neutrality condition, i.e., only neutral matter\ncan exist, the gapless phase is indeed a thermal stable\nstate as shown in [13, 14]. The existence of thermal stable gapless color superconducting phases was confirmed\nin Refs. [17] and generalized to finite temperatures in\nRefs. [18]. Recent results based on more careful numerical calculations show that the g2SC and gCFL phases\ncan exist at moderate baryon density in the color superconducting phase diagram [19] .\nOne of the most important properties of an ordinary\nsuperconductor is the Meissner effect, i.e., the superconductor expels the magnetic field [20]. In ideal color superconducting phases, e.g., in the 2SC and CFL phases,\nthe gauge bosons connected with the broken generators\nobtain masses, which indicates the Meissner screening\neffect [21]. The Meissner effect can be understood using the standard Anderson-Higgs mechanism. Unexpectedly, it was found that in the g2SC phase, the Meissner\nscreening masses for five gluons corresponding to broken\ngenerators of SU (3)c become imaginary, which indicates\na type of chromomagnetic instability in the g2SC phase\n[22, 23]. The calculations in the gCFL phase show the\nsame type of chromomagnetic instability [24]. Remembering the discovery of superfluidity density instability\n[25] in the gapless interior-gap state [26], it seems that\nthe instability is a inherent property of gapless phases,\nthough the result in Ref. [27] shows that there is no chromomangetic instability near the critical temperature.\nThe chromomagnetic instability in the gapless phase\nstill remains as a puzzle. By observing that, the 8-th\ngluon's chromomagnetic instability is related to the instability with respect to a virtual net momentum of diquark pair, Giannakis and Ren suggested that a LOFF\nstate might be the true ground state [28]. Their further\ncalculations show that there is no chromomagnetic instability in a narrow LOFF window when the local stability\ncondition is satisfied [29, 30]. Latter on, it was pointed\n\n\f2\nout in Ref. [31] that a charge neutral LOFF state cannot\ncure the instability of off-diagonal 4-7th gluons, while a\ngluon condensate state [32] can do the job. We will point\nout that, when charge neutrality condition is required,\nthere exists another narrow unstable LOFF window, not\nonly off-diagonal gluons but the diagonal 8-th gluon cannot avoid the magnetic instability.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we\ndescribe the framework of the gauged SU(2) Nambu\u2013\nJona-Lasinio(NJL) model in \u03b2-equilibrium. In Sec. III,\nwe probe the g2SC phase using different external fields,\nand we find that, except chromomagnetic instability, the\ng2SC phase is also unstable with respect to a color neutral baryon current. Then in Sec. IV, we propose that\na baryon current can be spontaneously generated in the\nground state due to the mismatch, and this baryon current generation state resembles the one-plane wave LOFF\nstate. We further analyze the instabilities of the LOFF\nstate under the requirement of charge neutrality condition and point out that there exists a narrow LOFF window, where not only off-diagonal gluons but the diagonal\n8-th gluon, cannot avoid the magnetic instability. Sec.\nV gives a general Nambu-Goldstone currents generation\ndescription in the non-linearization framework. At the\nend, we give the discussion and summary in Sec.

Here Aa\u03bc and A\u03bc are\ngluon fields and photon field, T a and Q are the generators\nof SU (3)c and U (1)EM gauge groups, respectively. Please\nnote that we regard all the gauge fields as external fields,\nwhich are weakly interacting with the system. The property of the color superconducting phase characterized by\nthe diquark gap parameter is determined by the unkown\nnonperturbative gluon fields, which has been simply replaced by the four-fermion interaction in the NJL model.\nWhile, the external gluon fields do not contribute to the\nproperties of the system. Therefore, we do not have the\ncontribution to the Lagrangian density from gauge field\npart Lg as introduced in [32]. (In Sec. V, by using the\nnon-linear realization in the gNJL model, we will derive\none Nambu-Goldstone currents state, which is equivalent\nto the so-called gluon-condensate state.)\nIn the Lagrangian density Eq.

PARAMAGNETIC RESPONSE TO A\nCOLOR NEUTRAL BARYON CURRENT\n\nIt is not understood why gapless color superconducting phases exhibit chromomagnetic instability. It sounds\nquite strange especially in the g2SC phase, where it is\nthe electrical neutrality not the color neutrality playing\nthe essential role. It is a puzzle why the gluons can feel\nthe instability by requiring the electrical neutrality on\nthe system. In order to understand what is really going 'wrong' with the homogeneous g2SC phase, we want\nto know whether there exists other instabilities except\nthe chromomagnetic instability. For that purpose, we\nprobe the g2SC phase using different external sources,\ne.g., scalar and vector diquarks, mesons, vector current,\nand so on. In this paper, we only report the most interesting result regarding the response of the g2SC phase to an\nexternal vector current V \u03bc = \u03c8\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8, the time-component\nand spatial-components of this current correspond to the\nbaryon number density and baryon current, respectively.\nFrom the linear response theory, the induced current\nand the external vector current is related by the response\nfunction \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd\nV (P ),\n\u03a0\u03bc\u03bd\nV (P ) =\n\ni\n1 T X h \u03bc\nTr \u0393\u0302V S(K)\u0393\u0302\u03bdV S(K \u2212 P ) .\n2 V\n\n(13)\n\nK\n\nThe trace here runs over the Nambu-Gorkov, flavor, color\nand Dirac indices.

(55)\n88\nin Ref. [23] , it can be clearly seen that, \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd\nV (P ) and\n\u03a0\u03bc\u03bd\n88 (P ) almost share the same expression, except the coefficients. This can be easily understood, because the\ncolor charge and color current carried by the 8-th gluon\nis proportional to the baryon number and baryon current, respectively. In the static long-wavelength (p0 = 0\nand p~ \u2192 0 ) limit, the time-component and spatial component of \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd\nV (P ) give the baryon number susceptibility\n\u03ben and baryon current susceptibility \u03bec , respectively,\n(15)\n\u03ben \u2261 \u2212 lim \u03a0\u030300\n~) \u221d m28,D ,\nV (0, p\np\n~\u21920\n\u0013\n\u0012\npi pj\n1\np) \u221d m28,M .

The g2SC phase exhibits a paramagnetic response to an external baryon current. Naturally,\nthe color current carried by the 8-th gluon, which differs\nfrom the baryon current by a color charge, also experiences the instability in the g2SC phase. The paramagnetic instability of the baryon current indicates that the\nquark can spontaneously obtain a momentum, because\ndiquark carries twice of the quark momentum, it is not\nhard to understand why the g2SC phase is also unstable\nwith respect to the response of a net diquark momentum.\n\n\f4\nIV. SPONTANEOUS BARYON CURRENT\nGENERATION AND THE LOFF STATE\nA.\n\nSpontaneous baryon current generation\n\nThe paramagnetic response to an external vector current naturally suggests that a vector current can be spontaneously generated in the system. The generated vector\ncurrent behaves as a vector potential, which modifies the\n~V,\nquark self-energy with a spatial vector condensate ~\u03b3 * \u03a3\nand breaks the rotational symmetry of the system. It can\nalso be understood that the quasiparticles in the gapless\nphase spontaneously obtain a superfluid velocity, and the\nground state is in an anisotropic state. The quark propagator G\u00b1\n0 (P ) in Eq. (8) is modified as\nh\ni\u22121\n~V,\nG\u00b1\n= \u03b3 0 (p0 \u00b1 \u03bc\u0302) \u2212 ~\u03b3 * ~\np \u2213 ~\u03b3 * \u03a3\n(17)\n0,V (P )\nwith a subscript V indicating the modified quark propagator. Correspondingly, the inverse of the quark propagator [S(P )]\u22121 in Eq. (6) is modified as\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ebh\ni\u22121\n+\n\u2212\n(P\n)\nG\n\u2206\n0,V\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\nh\ni\u22121 \uf8f8 . (18)\n[SV (P )]\u22121 = \uf8ed\n\u2212\n+\nG0,V (P )\n\u2206\n\nIt is noticed that the expression of the modified inverse\nquark propagator [SV (P )]\u22121 takes the same form as the\ninverse quark propagator in the one-plane wave LOFF\nstate shown in Ref. [29]. The net momentum ~q of the\ndiquark pair in the LOFF state [29] is replaced here by\n~ V . The spatial vector cona spatial vector condensate \u03a3\n~\ndensate ~\u03b3 * \u03a3V breaks rotational symmetry of the system.\nThis means that the Fermi surfaces of the pairing quarks\nare not spherical any more.\nIt has to be pointed out, the baryon current offers\none Doppler-shift superfluid velocity for the quarks. A\nspontaneously generated Nambu-Goldstone current in\nthe minimal gapless model [41] or a condensate of 8-th\ngluon's spatial component can do the same job. All these\nstates mimic the one-plane wave LOFF state. In the following, we just call all these states as the single-plane\nwave LOFF state.\nIn order to determine the deformed structure of the\nFermi surfaces, one should self-consistently minimize the\nfree energy \u0393(\u03a3V , \u2206, \u03bc, \u03bce , \u03bc8 ). The explicit form of the\nfree energy can be evaluated directly using the standard\nmethod, in the framework of Nambu\u2013Jona-Lasinio model\n[8, 13], it takes the form of\nZ\nT X\n\u22062\nd3 p~\n\u0393=\u2212\nTr ln([SV (P )]\u22121 ) +\n, (19)\n3\n2 n\n(2\u03c0)\n4GD\nwhere T is the temperature, and GD is the coupling constant in the diquark channel.\nWhen there is no charge neutrality condition, the\nground state is determined by the thermal stability condition, i.e., the local stability condition. The ground state\n\nis in the 2SC phase when \u03b4\u03bc < 0.706\u22060 with \u2206 \u2243 \u22060 ,\nin the LOFF phase when 0.706\u22060 < \u03b4\u03bc < 0.754\u22060 correspondingly 0 < \u2206/\u22060 < 0.242, and then in the normal phase with \u2206 = 0 when the mismatch is larger than\n0.754\u22060. Here \u2206, \u22060 indicate the diquark gap in the case\nof \u03b4\u03bc 6= 0 and \u03b4\u03bc = 0, respectively.\nB.\n\nUnstable neutral LOFF window\n\nNow come to the charge neutral LOFF state, and investigate whether the LOFF state can resolve all the magnetic instabilities.\nWhen charge neutrality condition is required, the\nground state of charge neutral quark matter should be\ndetermined by solving the gap equations as well as the\ncharge neutrality condition, i.e.,\n\u2202\u0393\n\u2202\u0393\n\u2202\u0393\n\u2202\u0393\n= 0,\n= 0,\n= 0.\n= 0,\n\u2202\u03a3V\n\u2202\u2206\n\u2202\u03bce\n\u2202\u03bc8\n\n(20)\n\nBy changing \u22060 or coupling strength GD , the solution of\nthe charge neutral LOFF state can stay everywhere in the\nfull LOFF window, including the window not protected\nby the local stability condition, as shown explicitly in\nRef. [31].\nFrom the lesson of charge neutral g2SC phase, we learn\nthat even though the neutral state is a thermal stable state, i.e., the thermodynamic potential is a global\nminimum along the neutrality line, it cannot guarantee\nthe dynamical stability of the system. The stability of\nthe neutral system should be further determined by the\ndynamical stability condition, i.e., the positivity of the\nMeissner mass square.\nThe polarization tensor for the gluons with color A =\n4, 5, 6, 7, 8 should be evaluated using the modified quark\npropagator SV in Eq. (18), i.e.,\ni\n1 T X h \u03bc\nTr \u0393\u0302A SV (K) \u0393\u0302\u03bdB SV (K \u2212 P ) ,\n2 V\nK\n(21)\nwith A, B = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and the explicit form of the vertices \u0393\u0302\u03bcA has the form \u0393\u0302\u03bcA \u2261 diag(g \u03b3 \u03bc TA , \u2212g \u03b3 \u03bc TAT ). In\nthe LOFF state, the Meissner tensor can be decomposed\ninto transverse and longitudinal component. The transverse and longitudinal Meissner mass square for the offdiagonal 4-7 gluons and the diagonal 8-th gluon have\nbeen performed explicitly in the one-plane wave LOFF\nstate in Ref. [29].\nAccording to the dynamical stability condition, i.e.,\nthe positivity of the transverse as well as longitudinal\nMeissner mass square, we can devide the LOFF state\ninto three LOFF windows [34]:\n1) The stable LOFF (S-LOFF) window in the region\nof 0 < \u2206/\u22060 < 0.39, which is free of any magnetic instability. Please note that this S-LOFF window is a little\nbit wider than the window 0 < \u2206/\u22060 < 0.242 protected\nby the local stability condition.\n\u03a0\u03bc\u03bd\nAB (P ) =\n\n\f5\n2) The stable window for diagonal gluon characterized\nby Ds-LOFF window in the region of 0.39 < \u2206/\u22060 <\n0.83, which is free of the diagonal 8-th gluon's magnetic\ninstability but not free of the off-diagonal gluons' magnetic instability;\n3) The unstable LOFF (Us-LOFF) window in the region of 0.83 < \u2206/\u22060 < rc , with rc \u2261 \u2206(\u03b4\u03bc = \u2206)/\u22060 \u2243\n1. In this Us-LOFF window, all the magnetic instabilities exist. Please note that, it is the longitudinal Meissner mass square for the 8-th gluon is negative in this\nUs-LOFF window, the transverse Meissner mass square\nof 8-th gluon is always zero in the full LOFF window,\nwhich is guaranteed by the momentum equation.\nUs-LOFF is a very interesting window, it indicates that\nthe LOFF state even cannot cure the 8-th gluon's magnetic instability. In the charge neutral 2-flavor system, it\nseems that the diagonal gluon's magnetic instability cannot be cured in the gluon phase, because there is no direct relation between the diagonal gluon's instability and\nthe off-diagonal gluons' instability. (Of course, it has to\nbe carefully checked, whether all the instabilities in this\nUs-LOFF window can be cured by off-diagonal gluons'\ncondensate in the charge neutral 2-flavor system.) It is\nalso noticed that in this Us-LOFF window, the mismatch\nis close to the diquark gap, i.e., \u03b4\u03bc \u2243 \u2206. Therefore it is\ninteresting to check whether this Us-LOFF window can\nbe stabilized by a spin-1 condensate [35] as proposed in\nRef. [41].\nIn the charge neutral 2SC phase, though it is unlikely, we might have a lucky chance to cure the diagonal instability by the condensation of off-diagonal gluons.\nHowever, this instability still exists in some constrained\nAbelian asymmetric superfluidity system, and it's a new\nchallenge for us to really solve this problem.\n\nV.\n\nSPONTANEOUS NAMBU-GOLDSTONE\nCURRENTS GENERATION\n\nWe have seen that, except chromomagnetic instability\ncorresponding to broken generators of SU (3)c , the g2SC\nphase is also unstable with respect to the external neutral\nbaryon current. It is noticed that all the instabilities are\ninduced by increasing the mismatch between the Fermi\nsurfaces of the Cooper pairing. In order to understand\nthe instability driven by mismatch, in the following, we\ngive some general analysis.\nA superconductor will be eventually destroyed and\ngoes to the normal Fermi liquid state, so one natural\nquestion is: how an ideal BCS superconductor will be destroyed by increasing mismatch? To answer how a superconductor will be destroyed, one has to firstly understand\nwhat is a superconductor. The superconducting phase is\ncharacterized by the order parameter \u2206(x), which is a\ncomplex scalar field and has the form of e.g., for electrical superconductor, \u2206(x) = |\u2206|ei\u03c6(x) , with |\u2206| the\namplitude and \u03c6 the phase of the gap order parameter\nor the pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson.\n\n1) The superconducting phase is charaterized by the\nnonzero vacuum expectation value, i.e., < \u2206 >6= 0, which\nmeans the amplitude of the gap is finite, and the phase\ncoherence is also established.\n2) If the amplitude is still finite, while the phase coherence is lost, this phase is in a phase decoherent pseudogap\nstate characterized by |\u2206| 6= 0, but < \u2206 >= 0 because\nof < ei\u03c6(x) >= 0.\n3) The normal state is characterized by |\u2206| = 0.\nThere are two ways to destroy a superconductor. One\nway is by driving the amplitude of the order parameter\nto zero. This way is BCS-like, because it mimics the\nbehavior of a conventional superconductor at finite temperature, the gap amplitude monotonously drops to zero\nwith the increase of temperature; Another way is nonBCS like, but Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)-like\n[36], even if the amplitude of the order parameter is large\nand finite, superconductivity will be lost with the destruction of phase coherence, e.g. the phase transition\nfrom the d\u2212wave superconductor to the pseudogap state\nin high temperature superconductors [37].\nStimulating by the role of the phase fluctuation in\nthe unconventional superconducting phase in condensed\nmatter, we follow Ref. [38] to formulate the 2SC phase\nin the nonlinear realization framework in order to naturally take into account the contribution from the phase\nfluctuation or pseudo Nambu-Goldstone current.\nIn the 2SC phase, the color symmetry G = SU (3)c\nbreaks to H = SU (2)c .

(28) for the new quark\nfields looks like an extension of the theory in Ref. [39] for\nhigh-Tc superconductor to Non-Abelian system, except\nthat here we neglected the singular phase contribution\n\nTo evaluate the ground state of \u0393(V\u03bc , \u2206, \u03bc, \u03bc8 , \u03bce ) as a\nfunction of mismatch is tedious and still under progress.\nIn the following we just give a brief discussion on the\nNambu-Goldstone current generation state [41], oneplane wave LOFF state [28, 29], as well as the gluon\nphase [32].\nIf we expand the thermodynamic potential\n\u0393(V\u03bc , \u2206, \u03bc, \u03bc8 , \u03bce ) of the non-linear realization form\nin terms of the Nambu-Goldstone currents, we will\nnaturally have the Nambu-Goldstone currents generationPin the system with the increase of mismatch, i.e.,\n7\n~\n~\n<\na=4 \u25bd\u03c6a >6= 0 and/or < \u25bd\u03c68 >6= 0 at large \u03b4\u03bc.\nThis is an extended version of the Nambu-Goldstone\ncurrent generation state proposed in a minimal gapless\nmodel in Ref. [41, 42]. From Eq. (28), we can see that\n~ \u03c68 contributes to the baryon current. < \u25bd\n~ \u03c68 >6= 0\n\u25bd\nindicates a baryon current generation or 8-th gluon\ncondensate in the system, it is just the one-plane wave\nLOFF state. This has been discussed in Sec. IV.\nThe\nP other four Nambu-Goldstone currents generation\n~ \u03c6a >6= 0 indicates other color current genera< 7a=4 \u25bd\ntion in the system, and is equivalent to the gluon phase\ndescribed in Ref. [32].\nWe do not argue whether the system will exprience\na gluon condensate phase or Nambu-Goldstone currents\ngeneration state. We simply think they are equivalent. In\nfact, the gauge fields and the Nambu-Goldstone currents\nshare a gauge covariant form as shown in the free propogator. However, we prefer to using Nambu-Goldstone\ncurrents generation than the gluon condensate in the\ngNJL model. As mentioned in Sec. II, in the gNJL\nmodel, all the information from unkown nonperturbative\ngluons are hidden in the diquark gap parameter \u2206. The\ngauge fields in the Lagrangian density are just external\nfields, they only play the role of probing the system, but\ndo not contribute to the property of the color superconducting phase. Therefore, there is no gluon free-energy\nin the gNJL model, it is not clear how to derive the\ngluon condensate in this model. In order to investigate\nthe problem in a fully self-consistent way, one has to use\nthe ambitious framework by using the Dyson-Schwinger\nequations (DSE) [43] including diquark degree of freedom\n[44] or in the framework of effective theory of high-density\nquark matter as in Ref. [45].\n\n\f7\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION\n\nIn this paper, we show that, except the chromomagnetic instability, the g2SC phase also exhibits a paramagnetic response to the perturbation of an external baryon\ncurrent. This suggests a baryon current can be spontaneously generated in the g2SC phase, and the quasiparticles spontaneously obtain a superfluid velocity. The\nspontaneously generated baryon current breaks the rotational symmetry of the system, and it is equivalent to the\none-plane wave LOFF state.\nWe further describe the 2SC phase in the nonlinear\nrealization framework, and show that each instability indicates the spontaneous generation of the corresponding\npseudo Nambu-Goldstone current. We show this NambuGoldstone currents generation state can naturally cover\nthe gluon phase as well as the one-plane wave LOFF\nstate.\nWe also point out that, when charge neutrality condition is required, there exists a narrow unstable LOFF\n(Us-LOFF) window, where not only off-diagonal gluons\nbut the diagonal 8-th gluon cannot avoid the magnetic\ninstability. The diagonal gluon's magnetic instability in\nthis Us-LOFF window cannot be cured by off-diagonal\ngluon condensate in color superconducting phase. More\ninterestingly, this Us-LOFF window will also show up in\nsome constrained Abelian asymmetric superfluid system.\nThe Us-LOFF window brings us a new challenge. We\n\n[1] R. Rapp, T.
