Our approach is based on the use of the Newton transformations (and their associated differential operators) and the Minkowski\nformulae for spacelike hypersurfaces.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe mathematical interest for the study of spacelike hypersurfaces in spacetimes\nbegan in the seventies, with the works of Calabi [13], Cheng and Yau [15], Brill and\nFlaherty [12], Choquet-Bruhat [16, 17], and later on with some other authors (cf.\ne.g. [23, 33, 11, 22, 9, 10]). Moreover, the study of such hypersurfaces is also of\ninterest from a physical point of view, because of its relation to several problems in\ngeneral relativity (see, for instance, [18, 19, 26]). A basic question on this subject is\nthe uniqueness of spacelike hypersurfaces with constant mean curvature in certain\nspacetimes (we refer the reader to the introductions of the papers [4] and [2] for\na brief account of it). More recently, there has been also an increasing interest in\nthe study of uniqueness of spacelike hypersurfaces with constant higher order mean\ncurvature, including the case of the second order mean curvature which is closely\nrelated to the intrinsic scalar curvature of the hypersurface (see Section 2).\nConformally stationary (CS) spacetimes are time-orientable spacetimes which\nare equipped with a globally defined timelike conformal vector field, and they include, for instance, the family of generalized Robertson-Walker (GRW) spacetimes.\nBy a GRW spacetime, we mean a Lorentzian warped product \u2212I \u00d7f M n with Riemannian fibre M n and warping function f . In particular, when the Riemannian\nfactor M n has constant sectional curvature then \u2212I \u00d7f M n is classically called\na Robertson-Walker (RW) spacetime (for the details, see Section 2). In a GRW\nspacetime, the vector field given by K(t, x) = f (t)(\u2202/\u2202t )(t,x) defines globally a\ntimelike conformal field, which is also closed, in the sense that its metrically equivalent 1-form is closed. As observed by Montiel in [28], every CS spacetime which\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 53C42; Secondary 53B30, 53C50.\nL.J.

GERVASIO COLARES\n\nis equipped with a closed timelike conformal vector field is locally isometric to a\nGRW.\nIn this paper, we are interested in the study of uniqueness of compact spacelike\nhypersurfaces with constant higher order mean curvature in GRW spacetimes. First\nof all, recall that if a GRW spacetime \u2212I \u00d7f M n admits a compact spacelike hypersurface, then it must be spatially closed, in the sense that the Riemannian factor\nM n must be compact [4, Proposition 3.2 (i)]. On the other hand, observe that, for\na spatially closed GRW spacetime \u2212I \u00d7f M n , the family of slices Mtn = {t} \u00d7 M n\nconstitutes a foliation of \u2212I \u00d7f M n by compact totally umbilical leaves with constant mean curvature H(t) = f \u2032 (t)/f (t) and, more generally, constant k-th mean\ncurvature Hk (t) = (f \u2032 (t)/f (t))k (for the details, see [4]). Therefore, it is natural to\naddress the following question:\nUnder what conditions must a compact spacelike hypersurface with\nconstant higher order mean curvature in a spatially closed GRW\nspacetime be a spacelike slice Mtn = {t} \u00d7 M n ?\nIn [4], the first author, jointly with Romero and S\u00e1nchez, considered that question for the case of constant mean curvature hypersurfaces. In particular, they\nfound that, when the ambient space obeys the so called timelike convergence condition, then every compact spacelike hypersurface with constant mean curvature\nmust be totally umbilical and, except in very exceptional cases, it must be a spacelike slice. As observed by those same authors in [5], the weaker null convergence\ncondition is enough to guarantee that the hypersurface must be totally umbilical,\nnot only for hypersurfaces into GRW spacetimes but, more generally, for hypersurfaces into CS spacetimes equipped with a timelike conformal vector field which\nis an eigenfield of the Ricci operator (and, in particular, for CS spacetimes which\nare equipped with a closed timelike conformal vector field). Later on, Montiel [28]\nconsidered again that question and, after a careful classification of the totally umbilical hypersurfaces with constant mean curvature, he completed the program by\nshowing that the only compact spacelike hypersurfaces with constant mean curvature into a GRW spacetime which satisfies the null convergence condition are the\nspacelike slices, unless in the case where the spacetime is a de Sitter space and the\nhypersurface is a round umbilical sphere.\nWith respect to the case of hypersurfaces with constant higher order mean curvature, in [28] Montiel also obtained a uniqueness result for hypersurfaces with constant scalar curvature (equivalently, constant second order mean curvature) into CS\nspacetimes with constant sectional curvature. More recently, the authors, jointly\nwith Brasil Jr., initiated the study of hypersurfaces with constant higher order\nmean curvature in CS spacetimes [2].\nIn all the references above considering that question, the main tool used to extract information about the spacelike hypersurfaces and prove the results are the so\ncalled Minkowski formulae. Actually, the use of Minkowski-type integral formulae\nin this context was first started by Montiel in [27] for the study of hypersurfaces\nwith constant mean curvature in de Sitter space, and it was continued later by\nAl\u0131\u0301as, Romero and S\u00e1nchez in [4, 5, 6] for constant mean curvature hypersurfaces\nin GRW spacetimes and, more generally, in CS spacetimes. Let us remark here\nthat for the case of the mean curvature, only the first and second Minkowski formulae come into play. However, for the case of higher order mean curvatures, one\nneeds to use successive Minkowski formulae, which involve covariant derivatives\n\n\fUNIQUENESS OF SPACELIKE HYPERSURFACES IN GRW SPACETIMES\n\n3\n\nof the Ricci tensor of the ambient spacetime. That makes the task much harder,\nunless one assumes that the ambient spacetime is Einstein or, even more, it has\nconstant sectional curvature. That is the case, for instance, in [1] where higher\norder Minkowski formulae are developed for spacelike hypersurfaces in de Sitter,\nin [28] where the third Minkowski formula is written for spacelike hypersurfaces\nin a CS spacetime with constant sectional curvature, and, more generally, in [2]\nwhere the authors, jointly with Brasil Jr., derived general Minkowski formulae for\nspacelike hypersurfaces in CS spacetimes with constant sectional curvature.\nIn this paper, which is a natural continuation of the references above, we go\ndeeper into the study of spacelike hypersurfaces with constant higher order mean\ncurvature in spatially closed GRW spacetimes. Our approach, which is based in\nthe use of the so called Newton transformations Pk and their associated second\norder differential operators Lk (see Section 3), allows us to extend the previous\nuniqueness results to the case where the ambient spacetimes do not have constant\nsectional curvature. For instance, and as a first application, in Section 5 we obtain\nthe following (Theorem 5.1):\nLet \u2212I \u00d7f M n a spatially closed GRW spacetime such that its warping function satisfies\nf f \u2032\u2032 \u2212 f \u20322 \u2264 0,\n(that is, such that \u2212 log f is convex). Let \u03a3n be a compact spacelike\nhypersurface immersed into \u2212I \u00d7f M n whose k-th Newton transformation Pk is definite on \u03a3, for some k = 0, 1 . . . , n \u2212 1. If the\nquotient Hk+1 /Hk is constant, then the hypersurface is an embedded slice {t0 } \u00d7 M , where t0 \u2208 I satisfies f \u2032 (t0 ) 6= 0 if k \u2265 1.\nThe proof of Theorem 5.1 is based strongly on the ellipticity of the differential\noperator Lk (or, equivalently, the definiteness of Pk ; for the details, see Section 3).\nIn Corollary 5.2 and Corollary 5.4 we apply the result above to situations where\nthe ellipticity of Lk can be derived from geometric hypothesis.\nOn the other hand, in Section 6 we derive general Minkowski formulae for hypersurfaces in GRW spacetimes which can be applied to the study of hypersurfaces\nwith constant higher order mean curvature in arbitrary RW spacetimes, even if the\nambient spacetime does not have constant sectional curvature. Our derivation of\nMinkowski formulae in this generality is based on the use of the operators Pk and\nLk , and on the detailed analysis of a series of terms which come into play when\nthe ambient space does not have constant sectional curvature. In particular, we\nare able to find a neat expression for the divergence of Pk (see formula (43)) which\nallows us to write our Minkowski formulae in a nice way.\nAs a first application of these Minkowski formulae, in Section 7 we obtain the\nfollowing uniqueness result (Theorem 7.2) under the assumption of null convergence condition (let us recall that a spacetime obeys the null convergence condition\nif its Ricci curvature is non-negative on null (or lightlike) directions; obviously,\nevery spacetime with constant sectional curvature trivially obeys null convergence\ncondition):\nLet \u2212I \u00d7f M n be a spatially closed RW spacetime obeying the null\nconvergence condition, with n \u2265 3, that is\n(1)\n\n\u03ba \u2265 sup(f f \u2032\u2032 \u2212 f \u20322 ),\nI\n\n\f4\n\nLUIS J. AL\u00cdAS AND A. GERVASIO COLARES\n\nwhere \u03ba is the constant sectional curvature of M n . Then every\ncompact spacelike hypersurface immersed into \u2212I \u00d7f M n with positive constant H2 is totally umbilical. Moreover, \u03a3 must be a slice\n{t0 } \u00d7 M n (necessarily with f \u2032 (t0 ) 6= 0), unless in the case where\n\u2212I \u00d7f M n has positive constant sectional curvature and \u03a3 is a\nround umbilical hypersphere. The latter case cannot occur if the\ninequality in (1) is strict.\nSee also Theorem 7.3 and Theorem 7.4 for two different versions of Theorem 7.2 for\nthe general case of hypersurfaces with constant higher order mean curvature Hk ,\nwhen k \u2265 3.\nFinally, in Section 9 and as another application of the second order differential operators associated to the Newton transformations, we obtain the following\nuniqueness result for hypersurfaces in GRW spacetimes (Theorem 9.2):\nLet \u2212I \u00d7f M n be a spatially closed GRW spacetime obeying the\nstrong null convergence condition, with n \u2265 3, that is,\n(2)\n\nKM \u2265 sup(f f \u2032\u2032 \u2212 f \u20322 ),\nI\n\nwhere KM stands for the sectional curvature of M n .

If Hk is constant, with 2 \u2264 k \u2264 n\nthen \u03a3 is totally umbilical. Moreover, \u03a3 must be a slice {t0 } \u00d7 M n\n(necessarily with f \u2032 (t0 ) 6= 0), unless in the case where \u2212I \u00d7f M n\nhas positive constant sectional curvature and \u03a3 is a round umbilical\nhypersphere. The latter case cannot occur if we assume that the\ninequality in (2) is strict.\nThe proof of Theorem 9.2 is based strongly on the ellipticity of the differential\noperators associated to the Newton transformations.\n2. Preliminaries\nConsider M n an n-dimensional Riemannian manifold, and let I be a 1-dimensional\nmanifold (either a circle or an open interval of R). We will denote by \u2212I \u00d7f M n the\n(n + 1)-dimensional product manifold I \u00d7 M endowed with the Lorentzian metric\nh, i = \u2212dt2 + f 2 (t)h, iM ,\nwhere f > 0 is a positive smooth function on I, and h, iM stands for the Riemannian metric on M n . That is, \u2212I \u00d7f M n is nothing but a Lorentzian warped product\nwith Lorentzian base (I, \u2212dt2 ), Riemannian fiber (M n , h, iM ), and warping function f . Following the terminology introduced in [4], we will refer to \u2212I \u00d7f M n as\na generalized Robertson-Walker (GRW) spacetime. In particular, when the Riemannian factor M n has constant sectional curvature then \u2212I \u00d7f M n is classically\ncalled a Robertson-Walker (RW) spacetime.\nConsider a smooth immersion \u03c8 : \u03a3n \u2192 \u2212I \u00d7f M n of an n-dimensional connected manifold \u03a3 into a GRW spacetime, and assume that the induced metric via\n\n\fUNIQUENESS OF SPACELIKE HYPERSURFACES IN GRW SPACETIMES\n\n5\n\n\u03c8 is a Riemannian metric on \u03a3; that is, \u03a3 is a spacelike hypersurface.

Its opposite will be refered as the past-pointing Gauss map of \u03a3.\nLet A : X (\u03a3) \u2192 X (\u03a3) stand for the shape operator (or Weingarten endomorphism) of \u03a3 with respect to either the future or the past-pointing Gauss map N .\nAs is well known, A defines a self-adjoint linear operator on each tangent space\nTp \u03a3, and its eigenvalues \u03ba1 (p), . . . , \u03ban (p) are the principal curvatures of the hypersurface.

We refer the reader to [2] for further details (see also [31]\nand [32] for other details about classical Newton tranformations for hypersurfaces\nin Riemannian spaces).\nLet \u2207 stand for the Levi-Civita connection of \u03a3. Associated to each Newton\ntransformation Pk , we consider the second order linear differential operator Lk :\nC \u221e (\u03a3)\u2192C \u221e (\u03a3) given by\nLk (f ) = trace(Pk \u25e6 \u22072 f ).\nHere \u22072 f : X (\u03a3)\u2192X (\u03a3) denotes the self-adjoint linear operator metrically equivalent to the hessian of f , and it is given by\nh\u22072 f (X), Y i = h\u2207X (\u2207f ), Y i,\n\nX, Y \u2208 X (\u03a3).\n\nObserve that\nLk (f ) =\n\ntrace(Pk \u25e6 \u22072 f ) =\n\nn\nX\n\nhPk (\u2207Ei \u2207f ), Ei i\n\ni=1\n\n=\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\nh\u2207Ei \u2207f, Pk (Ei )i =\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\nh\u2207Pk (Ei ) \u2207f, Ei i = trace(\u22072 f \u25e6 Pk ),\n\n\fUNIQUENESS OF SPACELIKE HYPERSURFACES IN GRW SPACETIMES\n\n7\n\nwhere {E1 , . . . , En } is a local orthonormal frame on \u03a3.

This happens trivially when k = 0,\nand actually L0 is nothing but the Laplacian operator \u2206. On the other hand, by\n[2, Corollary 3.2] this also happens for every k = 0, . . . , n when the GRW ambient\nspacetime has constant sectional curvature. This is a consequence of the following\nuseful expression for the divergence of the Newton operators, which can be found\nin [2, Lemma 3.1].\nLemma 3.1.

Clearly, L0 = \u2206 is always elliptic. For our applications, it will be useful to\nhave some geometric conditions which guarantee the ellipticity of Lk when k \u2265 1.\nFor k = 1 the following one is esentially a consequence of Lemma 3.10 in [20].\nLemma 3.2. Let \u03a3 be a spacelike hypersurface immersed into a GRW spacetime.\nIf H2 > 0 on \u03a3, then L1 is elliptic or, equivalently, P1 is positive definite (for an\nappropriate choice of the Gauss map N ).\nProof. Simple observe that by Cauchy-Schwarz inequality we have H12 \u2265 H2 > 0,\nand H1 does not vanish on \u03a3. By choosing the appropriate Gauss map, we may\nassume that\nH2 does not depend on the chosen N . Since\nP 2H1 > 0. Recall that\nn2 H12 =\n\u03bai + n(n \u2212 1)H2 > \u03ba2i for every i = 1, . . . , n, then \u03bci,1 = nH1 + \u03bai > 0\nfor every i and P1 is positive definite.\n\u0003\nOn the other hand, by an elliptic point in a spacelike hypersurface we mean\na point of \u03a3 where all the principal curvatures are negative, with respect to an\nappropriate choice of the Gauss map N . When 2 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2212 1, the existence of an\nelliptic point in \u03a3 also implies here that the operator Lk is elliptic on \u03a3, under the\nassumption that Hk+1 is positive on \u03a3 for that choice of N (if k is even). Even\nmore, we have the following result.\n1In our notation and following [30], we use R(X, Y )Z = \u2207\n[X,Y ] Z \u2212 [\u2207X , \u2207Y ]Z\n\n\f8\n\nLUIS J. AL\u00cdAS AND A.

In our computations, we\nwill also consider the function g(h), where g : I \u2192 R is an arbitrary primitive of\nf .

Before stating our result, recall from [4, Proposition 3.2 (i)] that if a GRW spacetime admits a compact spacelike hypersurface,\nthen the Riemannian factor M n is necessarily compact.

In that case, taking inot account that Lk (h) = tr(Pk \u25e6\u22072 h), \u22072 h(pmin ) is positive semi-definite and \u22072 h(pmax )\nis negative semi-definite, then we have that Lk (h)(pmin ) \u2265 0 and Lk (h)(pmax ) \u2264 0.\nTherefore, equations (22) and (23) imply\n\u0012\n\u0013\nHk+1\nHk+1\n(24)\nmax\n\u2265\n(pmin ) \u2265 (log f )\u2032 (hmin ),\nHk\nHk\nand\n(25)\n\nmin\n\n\u0012\n\nHk+1\nHk\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2264\n\nHk+1\n(pmax ) \u2264 (log f )\u2032 (hmax ).\nHk\n\n\f12\n\nLUIS J.

Finally, if \u2212 log f is convex, then (log f )\u2032 is non increasing and so\n(log f )\u2032 (hmax ) \u2264 (log f )\u2032 (hmin ),\nwhich jointly with (20) yields (21). This completes the proof of Lemma 5.5 in\nthe case where Pk is positive semi-definite. When Pk is negative semi-definite,\nthen the proof above also works, taking into account that now Hk < 0 on \u03a3, and\nLk (h)(pmin ) \u2264 0 and Lk (h)(pmax ) \u2265 0.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 5.1. Let us choose again the future-pointing Gauss map N on \u03a3.\nSince the quotient Hk+1 /Hk is constant on \u03a3, we know from (21) that Hk+1 /Hk =\n(log f )\u2032 (hmax ) = (log f )\u2032 (hmin ). Therefore\n(log f )\u2032 (h) =\n\nf \u2032 (h)\n= Hk+1 /Hk = \u03b1\nf (h)\n\nis constant on \u03a3, because (log f )\u2032 is non increasing on I by the hypothesis on the\nconvexity of \u2212 log f . Then, (18) reduces to\n(26)\n\nLk (g(h)) = \u2212ck (f (h) + hN, Ki)Hk+1 .\n\nObserve that Hk+1 = \u03b1Hk does not change sign on \u03a3, and observe also that the\nfunction hN, Ki satisfies\n(27)\n\nhN, Ki \u2264 \u2212kKk = \u2212f (h) < 0 on \u03a3.\n\nHence, by (26) we have that Lk (g(h)) does not change sign on \u03a3, which is a compact\nRiemannian manifold. In the case where Pk is positive definite, then Lk is an elliptic\noperator, and we may apply the classical maximum principle for such operators to\nconclude that the function g(h) is constant on the compact \u03a3. If Pk is negative\ndefinite, then the operator \u2212Lk is now elliptic and by the same argument we also\nconclude that g(h) is constant. But g(t) being an increasing function on t, that\nmeans that the height function h is constant on \u03a3 and then the hypersurface is an\nslice {t0 } \u00d7 M . Finally, when k > 0 it necessarily holds f \u2032 (t0 ) 6= 0 because slices\n{t} \u00d7 M with f \u2032 (t) = 0 are totally geodesic in \u2212I \u00d7f M n , and then Pk = 0 for\nevery k > 0.\n\u0003\nIt is worth pointing out that if the warping function satisfies the stronger condition f f \u2032\u2032 \u2212 f \u20322 \u2264 0 with equality only at isolated points of I at most, then\nTheorem 5.1 remains true under the assumption that Pk is semi-definite and the\nfunction Hk does not vanish on \u03a3. Actually, in this case we also get from (21) in\nLemma 5.5 that Hk+1 /Hk = (log f )\u2032 (hmax ) = (log f )\u2032 (hmin ). But the hypothesis on\nthe warping function implies now that (log f )\u2032 is strictly decreasing on I. Therefore,\nhmin = hmax and the height function h is constant on \u03a3. Then, we also obtain the\nfollowing related result.\nTheorem 5.6. Let \u2212I \u00d7f M n a spatially closed GRW spacetime such that its warping function satisfies the condition (19), with equality only at isolated points of I at\nmost. Let \u03a3n be a compact spacelike hypersurface immersed into \u2212I \u00d7f M n whose\nk-th Newton transformation Pk is semi-definite on \u03a3 and Hk does not vanish on\n\u03a3, for some k = 0, 1 . . . , n \u2212 1. If the quotient Hk+1 /Hk is constant, then the\nhypersurface is an embedded slice {t0 } \u00d7 M , where t0 satisfies f \u2032 (t0 ) 6= 0 if k > 0.\n\n\fUNIQUENESS OF SPACELIKE HYPERSURFACES IN GRW SPACETIMES\n\n13\n\n6. Minkowski formulae for hypersurfaces in GRW spacetimes\nThe use of Minkowski-type integral formulae for compact spacelike hypersurfaces\nin Lorentzian ambient spacetimes was first started by Montiel in [27] in his study\nof hypersurfaces with constant mean curvature in de Sitter space, and it was continued later by Al\u0131\u0301as, Romero and S\u00e1nchez in [4, 5, 6] for constant mean curvature\nhypersurfaces in GRW spacetimes and, more generally, in conformally stationary\nspacetimes. Observe that for the case of the mean curvature, only the first and\nsecond Minkowski formulae come into play. In [1], Aledo, Al\u0131\u0301as and Romero developed the general Minkowski formulae for compact spacelike hypersurfaces in de\nSitter space, and applied them to the study of hypersurfaces with constant k-th\nmean curvature. On the other hand, in [28] Montiel gave also another proof of\nthe first and second Minkowski formulae for spacelike hypersurfaces in conformally\nstationary spacetimes with a closed conformal field, as well as a proof of the third\nMinkowski formula for the case where the ambient spacetime has constant sectional\ncurvature. As observed by Montiel, his method of proof, which follows the ideas\nof Hsiung [25] and uses parallel hypersurfaces, has a very nice geometric interpretation but it is very difficult to carry our for succesive Minkowski formulae. The\nreason is that it involves covariant derivatives of the Ricci tensor of the ambient\nspace, and one need to assume at least that the ambient space is Einstein to get\nsome control of them. In [2] the authors, jointly with Brasil Jr., developed another\nmethod to obtain general Minkowski formulae for spacelike hypersurfaces in conformally stationary spacetimes. Although more analytic than geometric, this method,\nwhich follows the ideas of Reilly in [31], has the advantage of working for succesive\nMinkowski formulae. However, in order to get some interesting applications from\nthem, one need to assume again that the ambien t space has constant sectional\ncurvature.\nIn this section, and as another application of our formulae in Lemma 4.1, we\nwill derive general Minkowski-type formulae for compact spacelike hypersurfaces\nimmersed into a GRW spacetime. The main interest of these new approach is that\nour new Minkowski formulae can be applied to the study of hypersurfaces with\nconstant higher order mean curvature in arbitrary Robertson-Walker spacetimes,\neven when the ambient space does not have constant sectional curvature.\nLet \u03a3n be a compact spacelike hypersurface immersed into a GRW spacetime.\nThe general Minkowski formulae for \u03a3, as derived in [2], are just a simple consequence of our formula (18) and the expression (8). In fact, it follows from (8) and\n(18) that\ndiv(Pk (\u2207g(h))) = f (h)hdivPk , \u2207hi \u2212 ck (f \u2032 (h)Hk + hN, KiHk+1 ),\nfor every k = 0, . . . , n \u2212 1. Therefore, integrating this equality on the compact\nRiemannian manifold \u03a3, the divergence theorem gives the following Minkowski\nformulae,\n(28)\n\nck\n\nZ\n\n\u03a3\n\n(f \u2032 (h)Hk + hN, KiHk+1 )d\u03a3 =\n\nZ\n\nf (h)hdivPk , \u2207hid\u03a3,\n\n\u03a3\n\nwhere d\u03a3 is the Riemannian measure induced on \u03a3. This is just Theorem 4.1 in [2]\nfor the case of hypersurfaces into a GRW spacetime. In particular, if k = 0 then\n\n\f14\n\nLUIS J. AL\u00cdAS AND A.

On the other hand, when k = 1 we easily get from the inductive formula in\nLemma 3.1 that\nn\nX\nhR(Ei , \u2207h)N, Ei i = \u2212Ric(N, \u2207h),\nhdivP1 , \u2207hi =\ni=1\n\nwhere Ric denotes the Ricci tensor of \u2212I \u00d7f M n . A direct computation using the\ngeneral relationship between the Ricci tensor of a warped product and the Ricci\ntensors of its base and its fiber, as well as the derivatives of the warping function\n(see for instance [30, Corollary 43]), implies that, for the special case of our GRW\nambient spacetimes, we have\nRic(U, V ) =\n\nRicM (U \u2217 , V \u2217 ) + (n((log f )\u2032 )2 + (log f )\u2032\u2032 )hU, V i\n\u2212(n \u2212 1)(log f )\u2032\u2032 hU, \u2202t ihV, \u2202t i,\n\n(29)\n\nfor arbitrary vector fields U, V on \u2212I \u00d7f M n , where, for simplicity, we are writing\nlog f = log f (\u03c0I ), (log f )\u2032 = (log f )\u2032 (\u03c0I ), and (log f )\u2032\u2032 = (log f )\u2032\u2032 (\u03c0I ). Here RicM\ndenotes the Ricci tensor of the Riemannian manifold M n , and U \u2217 = (\u03c0M )\u2217 (U )\ndenotes projection onto the fiber M of a vector field U defined on \u2212I \u00d7f M n , that\nis,\nU = U \u2217 \u2212 hU, \u2202t i\u2202t .\nObserve that the decomposition \u2202t = \u2212\u2207h \u2212 hN, \u2202t iN yields (\u2207h)\u2217 = \u2212hN, \u2202t iN \u2217 .\nIn particular, it follows from (29) that\n\u0001\nhdivP1 , \u2207hi = \u2212Ric(N, \u2207h) = hN, \u2202t i RicM (N \u2217 , N \u2217 ) \u2212 (n \u2212 1)(log f )\u2032\u2032 (h)k\u2207hk2 .\nTherefore, the second Minkowski formula (when k = 1) for a compact spacelike\nhypersurface into a GRW spacetime becomes\nZ\nc1 (f \u2032 (h)H1 + hN, KiH2 )d\u03a3 =\n\u03a3\nZ\n\u0001\n\u2217\n\u2217\nhN, Ki RicM (N , N ) \u2212 (n \u2212 1)(log f )\u2032\u2032 (h)k\u2207hk2 d\u03a3.\n\u03a3\n\nFor its further reference, we summarize here the first two Minkowski formulae for\nspacelike hypersurfaces in a GRW spacetime.\nTheorem 6.1.

The latter case cannot occur if the inequality in (46) is strict.\n\u0001\nProof. Multiplying the first Minkowski formula (30) by the constant n2 H2 , and\nsubstracting the third Minkowski formula (formula (44) with k = 2), we obtain\n(47)Z \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0001\n\u03ba\nn\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2212 (log f ) (h) hP1 \u2207h, \u2207hi hN, Kid\u03a3 = 0.\n2 (H1 H2 \u2212 H3 ) +\nf 2 (h)\n\u03a3\n\nSince H2 > 0 we know from Lemma 3.2 that, for an appropriate choice of the\nGauss map N , the transformation P1 is positive definite and H1 > 0 on \u03a3. Since\nwe always have H22 \u2212 H1 H3 \u2265 0 (see, for instance, [24, Theorem 51 and Theorem\n144]), then in our case we get\nH2 2\n(H \u2212 H2 ) \u2265 0,\nH1 1\nby Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, with equality if and only if \u03a3 is totally umbilical.\nOn the other hand, since P1 is positive definite, we also have by NCC (46) that\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03ba\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2212\n(log\nf\n)\n(h)\nhP1 \u2207h, \u2207hi \u2265 0.\nf 2 (h)\nH1 H2 \u2212 H3 \u2265\n\nTherefore, since hN, Ki does not vanish on \u03a3, we conclude from (47) that \u03a3 is\ntotally umbilical and that\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03ba\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2212 (log f ) (h) hP1 \u2207h, \u2207hi \u2261 0 on \u03a3.\nf 2 (h)\nSince P1 is positive definite, it follows from here that either \u03a3 is a slice (equivalently,\n\u2207h \u2261 0) or\n\u03ba\n(48)\n\u2212 (log f )\u2032\u2032 (h) \u2261 0 on \u03a3.\nf 2 (h)\nFirst of all, observe that if \u03a3 is a slice {t0 } \u00d7 M n , then necessarily f \u2032 (t0 ) 6= 0 because of the condition H2 > 0 (recall that slices with f \u2032 (t0 ) = 0 are totally geodesic).\nOn the other hand, if \u03a3 is not a slice, since it we already know that it is totally\numbilical we have that H2 = H12 , which implies that \u03a3 has also constant mean\ncurvature. Therefore, applying the classification of compact umbilical spacelike hypersurfaces with constant mean curvature given by Montiel in [28, Theorem 5], we\nconclude that the only case in which \u03a3 is not a slice occurs only when \u2212I \u00d7f M n\nhas positive constant sectional curvature and \u03a3 is a round umbilical hypersphere.\n\n\fUNIQUENESS OF SPACELIKE HYPERSURFACES IN GRW SPACETIMES\n\n19\n\nFinally, observe that if the inequality in (46) is strict, then (48) cannot occur and\n\u03a3 is necessarily a slice.\n\u0003\nFor the general case of hypersurfaces with constant higher order mean curvature,\nwe can state the following version of Theorem 7.2.\nTheorem 7.3. Let \u2212I \u00d7f M n be a spatially closed RW spacetime obeying the null\nconvergence condition, with n \u2265 3. Assume that \u03a3n is a compact spacelike hypersurface immersed into \u2212I \u00d7f M n which is contained in a slab \u03a9(t1 , t2 ) \u2282 \u2212I \u00d7f M n\non which f \u2032 does not vanish. If Hk is constant, with 3 \u2264 k \u2264 n then \u03a3 is totally\numbilical. Moreover, \u03a3 must be a slice {t0 } \u00d7 M n (necessarily with f \u2032 (t0 ) 6= 0),\nunless in the case where \u2212I \u00d7f M n has positive constant sectional curvature and\n\u03a3 is a round umbilical hypersphere. The latter case cannot occur if the inequality\nin (46) is strict.\nProof. The proof follows the ideas of that of Theorem 5.10 in [2]. Let us assume,\nfor instance, that f \u2032 > 0 on (t1 , t2 ). From Lemma 5.3, we know that, with respect\nto the future-pointing Gauss map N , there exists a point p0 \u2208 \u03a3 where all the\nprincipal curvatures are negative. Therefore, the constant Hk = Hk (p0 ) is positive,\nand following the ideas of Montiel and Ros in [29, Lemma 1] and their use of\nGarding inequalities [21] (taking into account our sign convention in the definition\nof the j-th mean curvatures) we get that\n(49)\n\n1/2\n\nH1 \u2265 H2\n\n1/(k\u22121)\n\n\u2265 * * * \u2265 Hk\u22121\n\n1/k\n\n\u2265 Hk\n\n>0\n\non \u03a3.\n\nMoreover, equality at any stage happens only at umbilical points. Therefore, since\n(k\u22121)/k\nf \u2032 (h) > 0 on \u03a3, we have that f \u2032 (h)Hk\u22121 \u2265 f \u2032 (h)Hk\n. Integrating this inequality, and using the first (30) and the k-th Minkowski formulae (that is, (44) with\nk \u2212 1 instead of k; observe that 2 \u2264 k \u2212 1 \u2264 n \u2212 1), we get\nZ\nZ\nHk\nhN, Kid\u03a3 = \u2212\nf \u2032 (h)Hk\u22121 d\u03a3 \u2264\n\u03a3\n\u03a3\nZ\nZ\n(k\u22121)/k\n(k\u22121)/k\n\u2032\n\u2212Hk\nf (h)d\u03a3 = Hk\nhN, KiH1 d\u03a3.\n\u03a3\n\n\u03a3\n\nThat is,\n(50)\n\nZ\n\n\u03a3\n\n1/k\n\n(H1 \u2212 Hk )hN, Kid\u03a3 \u2265 0.\n\nSince N is future-pointing, we know that hN, Ki \u2264 \u2212f (h) < 0, and by (49) we have\n1/k\n1/k\nH1 \u2212 Hk \u2265 0. Therefore, (50) implies that H1 \u2212 Hk \u2261 0 on \u03a3, and hence the\nhypersurface is totally umbilical. Since Hk is a positive constant and \u03a3 is totally\numbilical, we know that all the higher order mean curvatures are constant. In\nparticular, H2 is a positive constant and the result follows by applying Theorem 7.2.\n\u0003\nWhen n \u2265 4 and Hk is constant with k \u2264 n \u2212 1, there is still another version of\nTheorem 7.3 under the assumption of existence of an elliptic point.\nTheorem 7.4.

We will compute it by using a local\northonormal frame on \u03a3 that diagonalizes A. It is worth pointing out that such a\nframe does not always exist; problems occur when the multiplicity of the principal\ncurvatures changes. For that reason, we will work on the subset \u03a30 of \u03a3 consisting of\npoints at which the number of distinct principal curvatures is locally constant, which\nis an open dense subset of \u03a3 [7, Paragraph 16.10]. Then, for every p \u2208 \u03a30 there\nexists a local orthonormal frame defined on a neighbourhood of p that diagonalizes\nA and, hence, diagonalize Pk , that is, {E1 , . . . , En } such that A(Ei ) = \u03bai Ei and\nPk Ei = \u03bci,k Ei .

Umbilicity of hypersurfaces in GRW spacetimes\n\nWhen k = 0, our formulas for the operator L0 = \u2206 acting on the functions g(h)\nand hN, Ki allow us to re-obtain the uniqueness result given by Montiel in [28,\nTheorem 6] for hypersurfaces with constant mean curvature.\nTheorem 9.1. Let \u2212I \u00d7f M n be a spatially closed GRW spacetime obeying the\nnull convergence condition, that is, satisfying\n(66)\n\nRicM \u2265 (n \u2212 1) sup(f f \u2032\u2032 \u2212 f \u20322 )h, iM ,\nI\n\nwhere RicM and h, iM are respectively the Ricci and metric tensors of the compact Riemannian manifold M n . Then the only compact spacelike hypersurfaces\nimmersed into \u2212I \u00d7f M n with constant mean curvature are the embedded slices\n{t} \u00d7 M n, t \u2208 I, unless in the case where \u2212I \u00d7f M n is isometric to de Sitter spacetime in a neighborhood of \u03a3, which must be a round umbilical hypersphere. The\nlatter case cannot occur if we assume that the inequality in (66) is strict.\nProof. Let us choose on \u03a3 the future-pointing Gauss map N and let us consider\nthe function \u03c6 = Hg(h) + hN, Ki \u2208 C \u221e (\u03a3). Since H is constant, from (18) and\n(62) we have that\n\u0001\n(67) \u2206\u03c6 = hN, Ki kAk2 \u2212 nH 2 + RicM (N \u2217 , N \u2217 ) \u2212 (n \u2212 1)(log f )\u2032\u2032 (h)k\u2207hk2 .\nObserve that, by Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, kAk2 \u2212 nH 2 \u2265 0 on \u03a3, with equality\nat umbilical points. Moreover, from (66) and (38) we also get\nRicM (N \u2217 , N \u2217 ) \u2212 (n \u2212 1)(log f )\u2032\u2032 (h)k\u2207hk2 \u2265 0.\nTherefore, since hN, Ki < 0 on \u03a3, by (67) we get that \u03c6 is superharmonic on \u03a3. But\n\u03a3 being compact we have that \u03c6 must be constant. Hence \u2206\u03c6 = 0, and kAk2 \u2212 nH 2\nvanishes on \u03a3, which means that \u03a3 is totally umbilical, and\n(68)\n\nRicM (N \u2217 , N \u2217 ) \u2212 (n \u2212 1)(log f )\u2032\u2032 (h)k\u2207hk2 = 0\n\u2217\n\non \u03a3.\n\nIf the inequality in (66) is strict, (68) is equivalent to N (p) = 0 at every p \u2208 \u03a3,\nthat is, k\u2207h(p)k = 0 at every p \u2208 \u03a3. Then, h must be constant and \u03a3 is a slice.\nIn the general case, we obtain that \u03a3 is totally umbilical and has constant mean\ncurvature in \u2212I \u00d7f M n . Then, the result follows by observing that the case where\nthe hypersurface is totally umbilical, but not a slice, can only occur if \u2212I \u00d7f M n is\n\n\fUNIQUENESS OF SPACELIKE HYPERSURFACES IN GRW SPACETIMES\n\n25\n\nlocally a de Sitter spacetime and \u03a3 is a round umbilical hypersphere (see the classification of compact spacelike hypersurfaces with constant mean curvature given\nby Montiel in [28, Theorem 5]).\n\u0003\nOur objective now is to extend the reasoning above to the case of hypersurfaces\nwith constant higher order mean curvature, using our general formulas for the\noperators Lk acting on the functions g(h) and hN, Ki. Specifically, we will prove\nthe following uniqueness result, which extends Theorem 7.3 to the case of GRW\nambient spacetimes. Here, instead of the null convergence condition we need to\nimpose on \u2212I \u00d7f M n the following stronger condition\nKM \u2265 sup(f f \u2032\u2032 \u2212 f \u20322 ),\n\n(69)\n\nI\n\nwhere KM stands for the sectional curvature of M n . We will refer to (69) as the\nstrong null convergence condition.\nTheorem 9.2. Let \u2212I \u00d7f M n be a spatially closed GRW spacetime obeying the\nstrong null convergence condition, with n \u2265 3. Assume that \u03a3n is a compact spacelike hypersurface immersed into \u2212I \u00d7f M n which is contained in a slab \u03a9(t1 , t2 )\non which f \u2032 does not vanish. If Hk is constant, with 2 \u2264 k \u2264 n then \u03a3 is totally\numbilical. Moreover, \u03a3 must be a slice {t0 } \u00d7 M n (necessarily with f \u2032 (t0 ) 6= 0),\nunless in the case where \u2212I \u00d7f M n has positive constant sectional curvature and\n\u03a3 is a round umbilical hypersphere. The latter case cannot occur if we assume that\nthe inequality in (69) is strict.\nProof. We may assume without loss of generality that f \u2032 (h) > 0 on \u03a3, and choose\non \u03a3 the future-pointing Gauss map N . Then, we know from Lemma 5.3 that there\nexists a point p0 \u2208 \u03a3 where all the principal curvatures (with respect to the chosen\norientation) are negative. In particular, the constant Hk is positive and we can\n1/k\nconsider the function \u03c6 = Hk g(h) + hN, Ki \u2208 C \u221e (\u03a3). Since Hk is constant, from\n(18) and (65) we have that\n\u0001\n1/k\nLk\u22121 \u03c6 = k nk (Hk \u2212 Hk Hk\u22121 )f \u2032 (h)\n(70)\n\u0001\n(k+1)/k\n+ nk hN, Ki(nH1 Hk \u2212 (n \u2212 k)Hk+1 \u2212 kHk\n)\n+hN, Ki\u0398,\n\nwhere\nn\n\n\u0398 =\n\n1 X\n\u03bci,k\u22121 KM (N \u2217 \u2227 Ei\u2217 )kN \u2217 \u2227 Ei\u2217 k2\nf 2 (h) i=1\n\n\u0001\n\u2212(log f )\u2032\u2032 (h) ck\u22121 Hk\u22121 k\u2207hk2 \u2212 hPk\u22121 \u2207h, \u2207hi ,\n\nand Pk\u22121 Ei = \u03bci,k\u22121 Ei for every i = 1, . . . , n.\nSince \u03a3 has an elliptic point, from the proofs of Theorem 7.3 and Theorem 7.4,\nrespectively, we know that inequalities (49) and (52) hold on \u03a3 for every k (inequality (52) was derived in the proof of Theorem 7.4, where we assumed that k \u2264 n \u2212 1;\nhowever (52) trivially holds also for k = n since Hn+1 = 0 by definition).

Since Lk\u22121 is an\nelliptic operator on the Riemannian manifold \u03a3, which is compact, we have, by the\nmaximum principle, that \u03c6 must be constant. Hence, Lk\u22121 \u03c6 = 0 and the three\nterms in (70) vanish on \u03a3. In particular, (71) is an equality and \u03a3 is a totally\numbilical hypersurface. Since Hk is a positive constant and \u03a3 is totally umbilical,\nwe have that all the higher order mean curvatures are constant. In particular, H1\nis a positive constant and the result follows by Theorem 9.1.\n\u0003\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was started while the first author was visiting the Departamento de\nMatem\u00e1tica of the Universidade Federal do Cear\u00e1, Fortaleza, Brazil.
