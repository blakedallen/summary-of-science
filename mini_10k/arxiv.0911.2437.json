An overview of neutrino-mixing models is presented with emphasis on the types of horizontal flavor and vertical\nfamily symmetries that have been invoked.

We present an overview of the types\nof models proposed and discuss ways in which the list of\nviable models can be reduced when more precise data is\nobtained. This presentation is an update of one published\nin 2006 in collaboration with Mu-Chun Chen [1] and,\ndue to space restrictions, is an abreviated version of one\nappearing in [2] with complete model references there.\n\nPRESENT OSCILLATION DATA AND\nUNKNOWNS\nThe present data within 3\u03c3 accuracy as determined by\nFogli et al. [3], for example, is given by\n\u2206m232\n\n= 2.39\n\n\u2206m221\n\n= 7.67\n\n+0.42\n\u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 ,\n\u22120.33\n\n+0.52\n\u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 ,\n\u22120.53\n\nsin2 \u03b823\n\n= 0.466\n\nsin2 \u03b812\n\n= 0.312\n\nsin2 \u03b813\n\n\u2264 0.046,\n\n+0.178\n,\n\u22120.135\n+0.063\n,\n\u22120.049\n\n(0.016 \u00b1 0.010),\n\nwith sin2 \u03b823 = 0.5, sin2 \u03b812 = 0.33, and sin2 \u03b813 = 0.\nThe reason for the plethera of models still in agreement with experiment of course can be traced to the inaccuracy of the present data and the imprecision of the\nmodel predictions in many cases. In addition, there are\na number of unknowns that must still be determined: the\nhierarchy and absolute mass scales of the light neutrinos; the Dirac or Majorana nature of the neutrinos; the\nCP-violating phases of the mixing matrix; how close to\nzero the reactor neutrino angle, \u03b813 , lies; how near maximal the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle is; whether\nthe approximate tri-bimaximal mixing is a softly-broken\nor an accidental symmmetry; whether neutrino-less double beta decay will be observable, and how large charged\nlepton flavor violation will turn out to be. In this presentation we survey the models to determine what they predict for the mixing angles, and neutrino mass hierarchy.\n\nTHEORETICAL FRAMEWORK\n(1)\n\nwhere the last figure in parenthesis indicates a departure\nof the reactor neutrino angle from zero with one \u03c3 accu-\n\n1\n\nracy determination. The data suggests the approximate\ntri-bimaximal mixing texture of Harrison, Perkins, and\nScott [4],\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n2/ \u221a6 1/\u221a3\n0\u221a\nUPMNS = \uf8ed \u22121/\u221a6 1/\u221a3 \u22121/\u221a 2 \uf8f8 , (2)\n\u22121/ 6 1/ 3 1/ 2\n\nWritten version of a talk presented at the 11th International Workshop\non Neutrino Factories, Superbeams and Beta Beams, Illinois Institute\nof Technology, Chicago, July 20-25, 2009.\n\nThe observation of neutrino oscillations implies that neutrinos have mass, with the mass squared differences\ngiven in Eq.(1). Information concerning the absolute\nneutrino mass scale has been determined by the combined WMAP, SDSS, and Lyman alpha data which place\nan upper limit on the sum of the masses [5],\n\n\u2211 mi \u2264 0.17 \u2212 1.2 eV,\ni\n\n(3)\n\n\fdepending upon the conservative nature of the bound extracted. An extension of the SM is then required, and possible approaches include one or more of the following:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nthe introduction of dim-5 effective nonrenormalizable operators;\nthe addition of right-handed neutrinos with their\nYukawa couplings to the left-handed neutrinos;\nthe addition of direct mass terms with right-handed\nMajorana couplings;\nthe addition of a Higgs triplet with left-handed Majorana couplings;\nthe addition of a fermion triplet with Higgs doublet\ncouplings.\n\nIf we exclude the last possibility, the general 6 \u00d7 6\nneutrino mass matrix in the B(\u03bd\u03b1 L , N\u03b1c L ) flavor basis of\nthe six left-handed fields then has the following structure\nin terms of 3 \u00d7 3 submatrices:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nML MNT\nM=\n,\n(4)\nMN MR\nwhere MN is the Dirac neutrino mass matrix, ML the lefthanded and MR the right-handed Majorana neutrino mass\nmatrices. With ML = 0 and MN << MR the type I seesaw\nformula,\nm\u03bd = \u2212MNT MR\u22121 MN ,\n(5)\nis obtained for the light left-handed Majorana neutrinos,\nwhile if ML 6= 0 and MN << MR , one obtains the mixed\ntype I + II seesaw formula,\nm\u03bd = ML \u2212 MNT MR\u22121 MN .\n\n(6)\n\nThere are two main approaches which we now describe that one can pursue to learn more about the theory\nbehind the lepton mass generation.\n\nTop - Down Approach\nIn the top-down approach one postulates the form of\nthe mass matrix from first principles. The models will\ndiffer then due to the horizontal flavor symmetry chosen,\nthe vertical family symmetry (if any) selected, and the\nfermion and Higgs representation assignments made.\nThe effective light left-handed Majorana mass matrix\nm\u03bd is constructed directly or with the seesaw formula\nonce the Dirac neutrino matrix MN and the Majorana\nneutrino matrices MR (and ML ) are specified. Since m\u03bd is\ncomplex symmetric, it can be diagonalized by a unitary\ntransformation, U\u03bdL , to give\nm\u03bddiag = U\u03bdTL m\u03bd U\u03bdL = diag(m1 , m2 , m3 ),\n\n(7)\n\nwith real, positive masses down the diagonal. On the\nother hand, the Dirac charged lepton mass matrix is\ndiagonalized by a bi-unitary transformation according to\n\u2020\nmdiag\n= UlR\nmlUlL = diag(me , m\u03bc , m\u03c4 ).\nl\n\n(8)\n\nThe neutrino mixing matrix [6], VPMNS , is then given by\n\u2020\nVPMNS \u2261 UlL\nU\u03bdL = UPMNS \u03a6,\n\n(9)\ni\u03b1\n\ni\u03b2\n\nin the lepton flavor basis with \u03a6 = diag(1, e , e ). Note\nthat the Majorana phase matrix \u03a6 is required in order\nto compensate for any phase rotation on U\u03bdL needed to\nbring it into the Particle Data Book phase convention [7].\n\nBottom - Up Approach\nOn the other hand, with a bottom-up approach in the\ndiagonal lepton flavor basis and with the general PMNS\nmixing matrix, one can determine the general texture of\nthe light neutrino mass matrix to be\nM\u03bd\n\ndiag\n\n\u2217\n= UPMNS\n\u03a6\u2217 M\u03bd\n\n\u2020\n\u03a6\u2217UPMNS\n\n\u2020\n\u2217\n= UPMNS\ndiag(m1 , m2 e\u22122i\u03b1 , m3 e\u22122i\u03b2 )UPMNS\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nA B B\u2032\n\u2261 \uf8ed * F\u2032 E \uf8f8,\n(10)\n*\n* F\n\nwhere the matrix elements are expressed in terms of the\nunknown neutrino masses, mixing angles and phases. By\nrestricting the mixing matrix, one can learn that some of\nthe matrix elements may not be independent.\n\nMODELS AND MIXING ANGLE\nPREDICTIONS\nAfter suggestions of atmospheric neutrino oscillations\nwere found by the IMB and Kamiokande-II Collaborations [8] in the early 1990's, it became fashionable to\nassign texture zeros in different positions to m\u03bd with a\ntop-down approach in hopes of identifying some flavor\nsymmetry, but the procedure is basis dependent [9].\nAnother popular method invoked a Le \u2212 L\u03bc \u2212 L\u03c4 lepton\nflavor symmetry [10]. The mass matrix then assumes the\nfollowing form\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0 \u2217 \u2217\nm\u03bd = \uf8ed * 0 0 \uf8f8 ,\n(11)\n* 0 0\nwhich only leads to an inverted hierarchy.\nBy making use of a bottom-up approach instead, one\nis able to observe that a \u03bc \u2212 \u03c4 interchange symmetry\n\n\fwith B\u2032 = B, F \u2032 = F in Eq. (10) leads to sin2 \u03b823 =\n0.5, sin2 \u03b813 = 0 with sin2 \u03b812 arbitrary.\nOn the other hand, with the assumption of exact tribimaximal mixing for which sin2 \u03b823 = 0.5, sin2 \u03b813 = 0,\nand sin2 \u03b812 = 0.333, one finds in Eq. (10) that B\u2032 =\nB, F \u2032 = F = 21 (A + B + D) and E = 21 (A + B \u2212 D), so\nthat just three unknowns are present.\nWith the realization in the past five years that neutrino\nmixing is well approximated by the tri-bimaximal mixing matrix, the name of the game has become one of\nfinding what discrete horizontal flavor symmetry groups\nwould lead naturally to this mixing pattern. Such flavor\nsymmetries can then be used as starting points with soft\nbreaking as the next approximation.\n\nDiscrete Horizontal Flavor Symmetry\nGroups\nOf special interest are those groups containing doublet\nand triplet irreducible representations. We list several of\nthe well-studied groups and pertinent features of each.\nThe permutation group of three objects, S3 , contains 6\nelements with 1, 1\u2032 , and 2 dimensional irreducible representations (IR's). The same eigenstates occur as those for\ntri-bimaximal mixing, but there is a 2-fold neutrino mass\ndegeneracy.\nThe group A4 of even permutations of four objects has\n12 elements with IR's labeled 1, 1\u2032 , 1\u2032\u2032 , and 3. A U(1)R\nsymmetry [11] may also be included to fix the mass\nscale which is otherwise undetermined. Early attempts to\nextend this flavor group to the quark sector failed, as the\nCKM mixing matrix for the quarks remained diagonal.\nThe group T \u2032 is the covering group of A4 , but interestingly A4 is not one of its subgroups. It contains 24 elements with 1, 1\u2032 , 1\u2032\u2032 , 3, 2, 2\u2032 , 2\u2032\u2032 IR's, where the first four\nare identical to those in A4 . While tri-bimaximal mixing is obtained for the leptons, due to the presence of\nthe three doublet IR's, a satisfactory CKM mixing matrix can also be obtained for the quarks.\nThe permutation group of 4 objects, S4 , has 24 elements with 1, 1\u2032 , 2, 3, 3\u2032 IR's. Although this and higher\ndimensional discrete flavor groups can also yield tribimaximal mixing, it appears that models based on A4\nare the most economical ones for the lepton sector.\n\nExamples Involving GUT Models\nStudies of neutrino mixing models in the framework\nof grand unified theories with a vertical family symmetry were first pursued in the 1990's and more intensely\nfollowing the discovery of atmospheric neutrino oscillations by the Super-Kamiokande Collaboration in 1998.\n\nExamples exist of models based on SU(5), SO(10), and\nE6 , where the SO(10) models are generally of two types.\nThe so-called \"minimal\" SO(10) models [12] involve\nHiggs fields appearing in the 10 and 126 IR's, but newer\nmodels of this type have been extended to include the\n120, 45, and/or 54 IR's. They generally result in symmetric and/or antisymmetric contributions to the quark\nand lepton mass matrices.\nOn the other hand, SO(10) models [13] with Higgs\nfields in the 10, 16, 16 and 45 IR's result in \"lopsided\"\ndown quark and charged lepton mass matrices due to the\nSU(5) structure of the electroweak VEV's appearing in\nthe 16 and 16 representations.\nFor either type of GUT model, type I seesaws only\nlead to a stable normal hierarchy for the light neutrino\nmasses [14], while type I + II seesaws can also result in\nan inverted hierarchy. Most of the SO(10) models have\na continuous and/or discrete flavor symmetry group producted with them, but no efforts were initially made to\nintroduce a discrete flavor symmetry group from one of\nthe types discussed earlier to achieve tri-bimaximal mixing. A few examples can now be found in the literature\nwhich combine an SU(5), SO(10) or E6 GUT symmetry\nwith a T \u2032 or A4 flavor symmetry with some success [15].\n\nSURVEY OF MIXING ANGLE AND\nHIERARCHY PREDICTIONS\nThe author has updated a previous survey [1] made in\ncollaboration with Mu-Chun Chen in 2006 of models in\nthe literature which satisfied the then current experimental bounds on the mixing angles and gave reasonably restrictive predictions for the reactor neutrino angle. The\ncutoff date for the present update is January 2009.\nMany models in the literature lack firm predictions for\nany of the mixing angles. For our analysis no requirement is made that the solar and atmospheric mixing angles or the mass differences be predicted, but if so, they\nmust also satisfy the bounds given in Eq. (1). A complete listing of the 86 models which meet our criteria are\nreferenced along with their predictions in [2].\nHere we simply present the model predictions in the\nform of histograms plotted against sin2 \u03b813 , where all\nmodels are assigned the same area, even if they extend\nacross several basic intervals. The results are shown in\nFigs. 1 and 2 for the lepton flavor models and grand\nunified models, respectively.

Both the T2K Collaboration at JPARC and the\nNO\u03bd A Collaboration at Fermilab are also expected to\nprobe a similar reach with their \u03bd\u03bc neutrino beams [17].\nEven if \u03bd\u0304e depletion is observed with some accuracy,\nit is apparent from the two histograms that the order\nof 10 - 20 models may survive which must still be\ndifferentiated. One suggestion is to make scatterplots of\nsin2 \u03b813 vs. sin2 \u03b812 and sin2 \u03b812 vs. sin2 \u03b823 . We have\nattempted to do this in Figs. 3, 4, and 5 for both the lepton\nflavor models and grand unified models, where only the\ncentral value predictions are plotted. Most of the models\nconsidered favor central values of sin2 \u03b812 lying below\n0.333, the value for exact tri-bimaximal mixing. This is\nin agreement with the present value extracted in Eq. (1),\nbut central values for sin2 \u03b823 \u2265 0.5 are preferred, while\nthe best extracted value is 0.466 from Eq. (1).\n\nFIGURE 3.

In fact, the effective mass plot for perturbed tribimaximal mixing in Fig. 6 shows a clear separation of\nthe normal and inverted ordering distributions, so accurate neutrino-less double beta decay experiments should\nbe decisive in determining the hierarchy.\n\n0.01\nnormal\ninverted\n\n0.001\n\nSUMMARY\n0.001\n\nWe have made a survey of neutrino mixing models based\non some horizontal lepton flavor symmetry and those\nbased on GUT models having a vertical family symmetry\nand a flavor symmetry. We have tried to differentiate the\nmodels on the basis of their neutrino mass hierarchy and\nmixing angles. Most of the models allow either mass\nhierarchy with the exceptions being just normal for the\ntype I seesaw models and only inverted for the conserved\nLe \u2212 L\u03bc \u2212 L\u03c4 models.\nFor both types of models our study indicates that the\nupcoming Double Chooz and Daya Bay reactor experiments will be able to eliminate roughly two-thirds of\nthe models surveyed, if their planned sensitivity reaches\nsin2 2\u03b813 \u2243 0.01 and no depletion of the \u03bd\u0304e flux is observed. However, no smoking gun apparently exists to\nrule out many types of models based on accurate data for\nsin2 \u03b813 alone, should evidence for a depletion be found.\nOf the order of 10 - 20 models have similar values for\nthis mixing angle in the 0.001 - 0.05 interval. Only the\nlepton flavor models appear to lead to extremely small\n< 10\u22124 .\nvalues of sin2 \u03b813 \u223c\n< 0.31 rather than 0.333\nMost models prefer sin2 \u03b812 \u223c\nfor tri-bimaximal mixing in agreement with the present\nbest value of 0.312. On the other hand, most models\nprefer sin2 \u03b823 \u2265 0.50 compared with a best fit value of\n0.466. One notable exception is the model of Stech and\nTavartkiladze [18] based on the E6 family group with\nSU(3) \u00d7 Z2 flavor symmetry.\nIt is clear that very accurate determinations of the\nneutrino mass hierarchy, the three mixing angles and\neventually the three CP-violating phases will be required\nto pin down the most viable models.\n\n0.1\n\nFIGURE 6.
