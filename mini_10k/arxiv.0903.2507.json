One of their central features is the ability\nto compute distances very efficiently because the distance between two vertices is simply\nthe number of coordinates in which they differ; the same ability to compute distances\nmay be transferred to any isometric subgraph of a hypercube. In this way partial cubes\nappear, a class of graphs intensively studied so far; see the books [12, 18, 31], the recent\npapers [3, 24, 42, 43], the recent (semi-)survey [41], and references therein. In particular\nwe point out a recent fast recognition algorithm [17] and improvements in classification\nof cubic partial cubes [16, 36].\nThe isometric dimension of a graph G is the smallest (and at the same time the largest)\ninteger d such that G isometrically and irredundantly embeds into the d-dimensional cube.\nClearly, the isometric dimension of G is finite if and only if G is a partial cube. This\ngraph dimension is well-understood; for instance, it is equal to the number of steps in\nChepoi's expansion procedure [9] and to the number of \u0398-equivalence classes [13, 45] of\na given graph. Two related graph dimensions need to be mentioned here since they are\nboth defined on the basis of isometric embeddability into graph products. The lattice\ndimension of a graph is the smallest d such that the graph embeds isometrically into\n\u2217\n\nFaculty of Mathematics and Physics, University of Ljubljana, Jadranska 19, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia; Institute of Mathematics, Physics and Mechanics, Jadranska 19, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.

Graphs with finite lattice dimension are precisely partial cubes and the dimension\ncan be determined in polynomial time [15]. Another dimension is the strong isometric\ndimension-the smallest integer d such that a graph isometrically embeds into the strong\nproduct of d paths [19, 20]. In this case every graph has finite dimension, but this\nuniversality has a price: it is very difficult to compute the strong isometric dimension.\nFibonacci cubes were first introduced by Hsu et al. in 1993 [28, 29], although closely\nrelated structures had been studied previously [4, 21, 27]. Different structural properties\nof this class of graphs were investigated [11, 37, 40]. In [8] it was shown that Fibonacci\ncubes are \u0398-graceful while in [44] an efficient recognition algorithm is presented. The\noriginal motivation for introducing Fibonacci cubes was as an interconnection network\nfor parallel computers; in that application, it is of interest to study the embeddability of\nother networks within Fibonacci cubes [10, 23].\nIn this paper we study this embedding question from the isometric point of view.\nWe introduce the Fibonacci dimension of a graph as the smallest integer f such that\nthe graph admits an isometric embedding into the f -dimensional Fibonacci cube. In the\nnext section we give definitions, notions, and preliminary results needed in this paper.\nIn Section 3 we a give a combinatorial characterization of the Fibonacci dimension using\nproperties of an associated graph, provide upper and lower bounds for the Fibonacci\ndimension in terms of the isometric and lattice dimension, and discuss the Fibonacci\ndimension of some particular classes of graphs. In Section 4 we show that computing the\nFibonacci dimension is an NP-complete problem, provide inapproximability results, and\ngive approximation algorithms.\n\n2\n\nPreliminaries\n\nWe will use the notation [n] = {1, . . . , n}. For any string u we will use u(i) to denote its\nith coordinate. Unless otherwise specified, the distance in this paper is the usual shortestpath distance for unweighted graphs. A graph G is an isometric subgraph of another graph\nH if there is a way of placing the vertices of G in one-to-one correspondence with a subset\n\n2\n\n\fof vertices of H, such that the distance in G equals the distance between corresponding\nvertices in H.\nThe vertex set of the d-cube Qd consists of all d-tuples u = u(1) u(2) . . . u(d) with\n(i)\nu \u2208 {0, 1}. Two vertices are adjacent if the corresponding tuples differ in precisely one\nposition. Qd is also called a hypercube of dimension d. Isometric subgraphs of hypercubes\nare partial cubes.\nA Fibonacci string of length d is a binary string u(1) u(2) . . . u(d) with u(i) *u(i+1) = 0 for\ni \u2208 [d \u2212 1]. In other words, a Fibonacci string is a binary string without two consecutive\nones. The set of Fibonacci strings of length d can be decomposed into two subsets, strings\nstarting with 0 followed by a Fibonacci string of length d \u2212 1, and strings starting with\n10 followed by a Fibonacci string of length d \u2212 2. For this reason the number of distinct\nFibonacci strings of length d satisfies the Fibonacci recurrence and equals a Fibonacci\nnumber. The Fibonacci cube \u0393d , d \u2265 1, is the subgraph of Qd induced by the Fibonacci\nstrings of length d. The Fibonacci cube may alternatively be defined as the graph of the\ndistributive lattice of order-ideals of a fence poset [4, 21, 27] or as the simplex graph of\nthe complement graph of a path graph. Since graphs of distributive lattices and simplex\ngraphs are both instances of median graphs [2, 7], we have:\nTheorem 2.1 ([33]) Fibonacci cubes are median graphs. In particular, Fibonacci cubes\nare partial cubes and \u0393d isometrically embeds into Qd .\nWe will use the lattice Zd equipped with the L1 -distance. Therefore,\nthe distance\nP\nd\nbetween any two elements (x1 , . . . , xd ), (y1 , . . . , yd ) \u2208 Z is given by i |xi \u2212 yi |. It will\nbe convenient to visualize Zd as an infinite graph whose vertex set are elements of Zd and\nwhere two vertices are adjacent when they are at distance one; with this visualization,\nL1 -distance coincides with the shortest path distance in the graph.\nLet G be a connected graph. The isometric dimension, idim(G), is the smallest\ninteger k such that G admits an isometric embedding into Qk . If there is no such k we set\nidim(G) = \u221e. Be definition, idim(G) < \u221e if and only if G is a partial cube. The lattice\ndimension, ldim(G), is the smallest integer ` such that G admits an isometric embedding\ninto Z` . We similarly define the Fibonacci dimension, fdim(G), as the smallest integer f\nsuch that G admits an isometric embedding into \u0393f , and set fdim(G) = \u221e if there is no\nsuch f .\nLet \u03b2 : V (G) \u2192 V (Qk ) be an isometric embedding. We will denote the ith coordinate\nof \u03b2 with \u03b2 (i) . The embedding \u03b2 is called irredundant if \u03b2 (i) (V (G)) = {0, 1} for each\ni \u2208 [k]. If an embedding is not irredundant, we may find an embedding onto a lowerdimensional hypercube by omitting the redundant coordinates. An isometric embedding\n\u03b2 : G \u2192 Qk is irredundant if and only if k = idim(G) [45].\nLet G be a partial cube with idim(G) = k and assume that we are given an isometric\nembedding \u03b2 of G into Qk . Each pair (i, \u03c7) \u2208 [k] \u00d7 {0, 1} defines the semicube W(i,\u03c7) =\n{u \u2208 V (G) | \u03b2 (i) (u) = \u03c7}. For any i \u2208 [k], we refer to W(i,0) , W(i,1) as a complementary\npair of semicubes. This definition and notation seems to depend on the embedding \u03b2.\nHowever, any irredundant isometric embedding \u03b2 0 describes the same family of semicubes\nand pairs of complementary semicubes, possibly indexed in a different way.\nFor a partial cube G and a complementary pair of semicubes W(i,0) , W(i,1) , the set of\nedges with one endvertex in W(i,0) and the other in W(i,1) constitute a \u0398-class of G. The\n\u0398-classes of G form a partition of E(G).\nTo determine the lattice dimension of a graph G, Eppstein [15] introduced the semicube\ngraph Sc(G) of a partial cube G as the graph with all the semicubes as nodes, semicubes\nW(i,\u03c7) and W(i0 ,\u03c70 ) being adjacent if W(i,\u03c7) \u222a W(i0 ,\u03c70 ) = V (G) and W(i,\u03c7) \u2229 W(i0 ,\u03c70 ) 6= \u2205.

See also [34] for further work on semicube graphs.\nFor any graph G, its simplex graph \u03ba(G) is defined as follows. There is a vertex uK in\n\u03ba(G) for each clique K of G; here we regard \u2205, each vertex, and each edge of G as a clique.\nThere is an edge between vertices uK and uK 0 of \u03ba(G) whenever the cliques K and K 0 of\nG differ by exactly one vertex. In particular, there is an edge between u\u2205 and ua for each\na \u2208 V (G), and there is an edge between ua and uab for each edge ab \u2208 E(G). We will also\nuse the 2-simplex graph \u03ba2 (G) of a graph G, which is the subgraph of \u03ba(G) induced by\nthe vertices uK of \u03ba(G) corresponding to cliques K with at most 2 vertices. An example\nis given in Figure 3. When G has no triangle, then \u03ba2 (G) = \u03ba(G). 2-simplex graphs\nwere used in [32] to establish a close connection between the recognition complexity of\ntriangle-free graphs and of median graphs.\nFinally, computing an embedding of G into Qd (or \u0393d ) means to attach to each vertex\nv of G a tuple \u03b2(v) that is a vertex of Qd such that \u03b2 provides an isometric embedding.\n\n4\n\n\f3\n3.1\n\nCombinatorial aspects\nThe general case\n\nProposition 3.1 Let G be a connected graph. Then fdim(G) < \u221e if and only if idim(G) <\n\u221e. Moreover,\nidim(G) \u2264 fdim(G) \u2264 2 idim(G) \u2212 1 .\nProof. Let f = fdim(G) < \u221e, so that G isometrically embeds into \u0393f . By Theorem 2.1,\n\u0393f isometrically embeds into Qf , hence G isometrically embeds into Qf . The Fibonacci\nstrings with which \u0393f was derived may be used directly as the coordinates of an isometric\nembedding. Consequently idim(G) \u2264 f = fdim(G).\nConversely, let k = idim(G) < \u221e and consider G isometrically embedded into Qk .\nTo each vertex u = u(1) u(2) . . . u(k\u22121) u(k) of G (embedded into Qk ) assign the vertex\nu\ne = u(1) 0u(2) 0 . . . u(k\u22121) 0u(k) . Clearly, u\ne(i) * u\ne(i+1) = 0 for any i \u2208 [2k \u2212 2]. Therefore, we\ne be the subgraph of \u03932k\u22121 induced by the vertices\ncan consider u\ne as a vertex of \u03932k\u22121 . Let G\nu\ne, u \u2208 V (G). Since \u03932k\u22121 is isometric in Q2k\u22121 (invoking Theorem 2.1 again), it readily\ne is isometric in \u03932k\u22121 . We conclude that fdim(G) \u2264 2k \u2212 1 = 2 idim(G) \u2212 1.\nfollows that G\n\u0003\nIt is now clear that we only need to study the Fibonacci dimension of partial cubes.\nUsing the lattice dimension ldim(G) we will further improve in Proposition 3.7 the upper\nbound on fdim(G), and provide an alternative lower bound in Proposition 3.8.\nLet G be a partial cube with idim(G) = k. In order to obtain an expression for\nfdim(G) in terms of idim(G) we construct the graph X(G) as follows. The nodes of X(G)\nare the semicubes W(i,\u03c7) , (i, \u03c7) \u2208 [k] \u00d7 {0, 1}, of G, semicubes W(i,\u03c7) and W(j,\u03c70 ) being\nadjacent if i 6= j and W(i,\u03c7) \u2229 W(j,\u03c70 ) = \u2205. Note that X(G) is very close to the complement\nof the Eppstein's semicube graph Sc(G).\nA path P of X(G) with the property that |P \u2229 {W(i,0) , W(i,1) }| \u2264 1 for each complementary pair of semicubes W(i,0) , W(i,1) , will be called a coordinating path. A set of paths\nP of X(G) will be called a system of coordinating paths provided that any P \u2208 P is a\ncoordinating path and for each complementary pair of semicubes W(i,0) , W(i,1) there is\nexactly one P \u2208 P such that |P \u2229 {W(i,0) , W(i,1) }| = 1.\nLemma 3.2 Let G be a partial cube and let P be a system of coordinating paths of X(G).\nThen there is an isometric embedding of G into \u0393f 0 , where f 0 = idim(G) + |P| \u2212 1 .\nProof. Let k = idim(G), let p = |P|, and let P = {P1 , . . . , Pp } be the given system of\ncoordinating paths of X(G). Let\nP1 : W(a1 ,\u03c71 ) \u2192 W(a2 ,\u03c72 ) \u2192 * * * \u2192 W(ai1 ,\u03c7i1 )\nP2 : W(ai1 +1 ,\u03c7i1 +1 ) \u2192 W(ai1 +2 ,\u03c7i1 +2 ) \u2192 * * * \u2192 W(ai2 ,\u03c7i2 )\n..\n.\nPp : W(aip\u22121 +1 ,\u03c7ip\u22121 +1 ) \u2192 W(aip\u22121 +2 ,\u03c7ip\u22121 +2 ) \u2192 * * * \u2192 W(aip ,\u03c7ip ) .\nAs the paths meet exactly one of the complementary semicubes exactly once, ip = k.\nMore precisely, there is a bijection \u03c6 : {a1 , a2 , . . . , aip } \u2192 [k] such that if \u03c6(ai ) = j then\neither W(ai ,\u03c7i ) = W(j,0) or W(ai ,\u03c7i ) = W(j,1) holds.\nFor any vertex u of G and any i \u2208 [k] set\n(\n1 if u \u2208 W(ai ,\u03c7i ) ;\n(i)\n\u016b =\n0 otherwise.\n5\n\n\fAssigning the k-tuple\nu = \u016b(1) \u016b(2) . . . \u016b(ip )\nto any vertex u of G yields the canonical isometric embedding of G into Qk = Qip . Now\nassign to u the following d-tuple:\n\u016b(1) . . . \u016b(i1 ) 0\u016b(i1 +1) . . . \u016b(i2 ) 0 . . . 0\u016b(ip\u22121 +1) . . . \u016b(ip ) .\nIn this way, G is embedded into Qf 0 , where f 0 = k + p \u2212 1. Moreover, the embedding\nis clearly still isometric. Because W(ai ,\u03c7i ) \u2229 W(ai+1 ,\u03c7i+1 ) = \u2205 provided that W(ai ,\u03c7i ) and\nW(ai+1 ,\u03c7i+1 ) are connected by an edge of some path Pj , the labeling of u is a Fibonacci\nstring. Hence we have described an isometric embedding of G into \u0393f 0 .\n\u0003\nLet p(X(G)) be the minimum size of a system of coordinating paths of X(G). Then:\nTheorem 3.3 Let G be a partial cube. Then\nfdim(G) = idim(G) + p(X(G)) \u2212 1 .\nProof. Let p = p(X(G)), k = idim(G), and f = fdim(G). If readily follows from\nLemma 3.2 and the definition of p(X(G)) that f \u2264 k + p \u2212 1.\nConsider now G isometrically embedded into \u0393f . For u \u2208 V (G) let u(1) . . . u(f ) be the\nembedded vertex. Let 1 \u2264 i1 < i2 < * * * < ir \u2264 f be the indices for which all the vertices\nof G are labeled 0. That is, u(ij ) = 0 holds for any u \u2208 V (G) and any ij , 1 \u2264 j \u2264 r. Then\n\u03b2(u) = u(1) . . . u(i1 \u22121) u(i1 +1) . . . u(i2 \u22121) u(i2 +1) . . . u(ir\u22121 \u22121) u(ir\u22121 +1) . . . u(ir )\nis an isometric embedding into Qf \u2212r .\nWe next assert that for any coordinate i of the (f \u2212 r)-tuples \u03b2, Yi = {\u03b2 (i) (u) | u \u2208\nV (G)} = {0, 1}. Note first that Yi 6= {1} because otherwise the ith coordinate could\nbe removed and hence we would isometrically embed G into \u0393f \u22121 . On the other hand\nYi 6= {0} since we have removed all such coordinates in the construction of \u03b2. Hence the\nassertion. However, this implies that f is an irredundant embedding and therefore\nk = idim(G) = f \u2212 r .\nFor a given coordinate ` of \u03b2, set W` = {u \u2208 V (G) | \u03b2 (`) (u) = 1}. Then W` is a\nsemicube. Moreover, because \u03b2 is obtained from Fibonacci strings, the paths\nW1 \u2192 W2 \u2192 . . . \u2192 Wi1 \u22121 ,\nWi1 +1 \u2192 Wi1 +2 \u2192 . . . \u2192 Wi2 \u22121 ,\n..\n.\nWir\u22121 +1 \u2192 Wir\u22121 +2 \u2192 . . . \u2192 Wir ,\nform a system of coordinating paths with r + 1 paths. Consequently, r + 1 \u2265 p and hence\nk = f \u2212 r \u2264 f \u2212 p + 1.\nWe conclude that f \u2265 k + p \u2212 1 which completes the proof.\nNote that Proposition 3.1 also follows easily from Theorem 3.3.\n\n6\n\n\u0003\n\n\f3.2\n\nParticular cases\n\nIt is interesting to ask which partial cubes have extremal Fibonacci dimension. Interestingly, the minimum case is difficult; see Section 4.1. However, there is a neat characterization for the maximum case, which we provide next. Afterwards we establish the\nFibonacci dimension of the Cartesian product of graphs and the Fibonacci dimension of\ntrees.\nThe crossing graph G# of a partial cube G has the \u0398-classes of G as its nodes, where\ntwo nodes of G# are joined by an edge whenever they cross as \u0398-classes in G; see [35].\nMore precisely, if W(a,0) , W(a,1) and W(b,0) , W(b,1) are pairs of complementary semicubes\ncorresponding to \u0398-classes E and F , then E and F cross if each semicube has a nonempty\nintersection with the semicubes from the other pair; that is, it holds that W(a,0) \u2229 W(b,0) ,\nW(a,0) \u2229 W(b,1) , W(a,1) \u2229 W(b,0) , and W(a,1) \u2229 W(b,1) are nonempty.\nCorollary 3.4 Let G be a partial cube with idim(G) = k. Then fdim(G) = 2k \u2212 1 if and\nonly if G# = Kk .\nProof. By Theorem 3.3, fdim(G) = 2k \u2212 1 if and only if p(X(G)) = k. This holds if and\nonly if X(G) has no edges which is in turn true if and only if for any distinct i, j \u2208 [k]\nthe semicubes W(i,0) and W(i,1) nontrivially intersect W(j,0) and W(j,1) . But this is true if\nand only if the corresponding \u0398-classes cross.\n\u0003\nA characterization of complete crossing graphs in terms of the expansion procedure\nis given in [35]: G# is complete if and only if G can be obtained from K1 by a sequence\nof all-color expansions. We also note that among median graphs only hypercubes have\ncomplete crossing graphs [38].\nCorollary 3.5 For any partial cubes G and H, fdim(G \u0003 H) = fdim(G) + fdim(H) + 1.\nProof. It is easy to infer that X(G \u0003 H) is isomorphic to X(G) \u222a X(H). Therefore,\np(X(G \u0003 H)) = p(X(G))+p(X(H)). Since it is well-known that idim(G \u0003 H) = idim(G)+\nidim(H) we have\nfdim(G \u0003 H) = idim(G \u0003 H) + p(X(G \u0003 H)) \u2212 1\n= idim(G) + idim(H) + p(X(G) \u222a X(H)) \u2212 1\n= idim(G) + idim(H) + p(X(G)) + p(X(H)) \u2212 1\n= (idim(G) + p(X(G)) \u2212 1) + (idim(H) + p(X(H))\n= fdim(G) + fdim(H) + 1 ,\nwhere for the first equality Theorem 3.3 is applied.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 3.6 For any tree T , fdim(T ) = idim(T ) = |E(T )|.\nProof. Let n = |V (T )|. It is well-known that idim(T ) = |E(T )| = n \u2212 1, and that each\nedge e of T constitutes a \u0398-class [25] (cf. [31, Corollary 3.4.]). This means that each edge\ne \u2208 E(T ) defines a pair of complementary semicubes: each semicube is the set of vertices\nin one of the two subtrees of T \u2212 e.\nLet P be a longest path in the tree T . We split P at a vertex r into two subpaths\nP1 , P2 , such that P1 and P2 have the same length (if P has an even number of edges), or\ndiffer by one edge (if P has an odd number of edges). Without loss of generality, let us\n7\n\n\fr\n\ne1\ne5\ne12\n\nu\n\ne19\nv\n\nFigure 4: A tree with a longest path P marked with thicker edges. In the proof of\nCorollary 3.6, P1 would be the path between r and v, P2 would be the path between r\nand u, the labeling of the edges of P1 corresponds to a proper enumeration, and the nodes\nmarked with squares correspond to the semicube We5 .\n*01\n*00\n*10\n10*\n\n00*\n\n01*\n\nFigure 5: A lattice embedding of \u03934 .\nassume that P1 is not strictly shorter than P2 . Therefore |E(P1 )| = |E(P2 )| if |E(P )| is\neven and |E(P1 )| = 1 + |E(P2 )| if |E(P )| is odd. See Figure 4.\nIt may be convenient to visualize T as rooted at r. We further define the level of an\nedge xy of T as the minimum of dT (r, x), dT (r, y). For any edge e of T , let We denote\nthe subset of vertices in the subtree T \u2212 e that does not contain the vertex r. As noted\nbefore, We is a semicube, and hence a node of X(T ), for any e \u2208 E(T ).\nLet e1 , e2 , . . . en\u22121 be an enumeration of the edges of T with the following properties:\n(a) any edge at level i is listed before any edge at level i + 1, and (b) the edge of P1 at\nlevel i is the first edge at level i in the enumeration. Consider the sequence of semicubes\nWe1 , We2 , . . . , Wen\u22121 . If the edges ei and ei+1 are at the same level, then clearly Wei \u2229\nWei+1 = \u2205. If ei and ei+1 are not at the same level, then ei+1 must be an edge on P1 while ei\ncannot be an edge on P1 . Therefore we also have Wei \u2229Wei+1 = \u2205 in this case. This means\nthat We1 \u2192 We2 \u2192 . . . \u2192 Wen\u22121 is a path in X(G), and furthermore forms a system of\ncoordinating paths because it visits each complementary pair of semicubes exactly once.\nWe conclude that p(X(T )) = 1, and thus fdim(T ) = idim(T ) by Theorem 3.3.\n\u0003\n\n3.3\n\nRelation to lattice dimension\n\nUsing the lattice dimension ldim(G), we can provide upper and lower bounds on the\nFibonacci dimension fdim(G). The first bound improves upon Proposition 3.1.\nProposition 3.7 Let G be a partial cube. Then fdim \u2264 idim(G) + ldim(G) \u2212 1.\n\n8\n\n\fProof. For any integers a, b with a \u2264 b, we use P(a,b) to denote the subgraph of Z1\ninduced by vertices a, a + 1, . . . , b \u2212 1, b. Hence P(a,b) is a path on b \u2212 a + 1 vertices and\nfdim(P(a,b) ) = b \u2212 a by Corollary 3.6.\nLet ` = ldim(G) and consider an isometric embedding \u03b2 of G into Z` . For each\n(i)\ncoordinate i \u2208 [`], let ai = min{\u03b2 (i) (v)\nP| v \u2208 V (G)} and let bi = max{\u03b2 (v) | v \u2208 V (G)}.\nIt is shown in [15, Lemma 1] that i (bi \u2212 ai ) is precisely idim(G). By the choice of\nai , bi , the embedding \u03b2 is also an isometric embedding of G into the Cartesian product\nP(a1 ,b1 ) \u0003 P(a2 ,b2 ) \u0003 * * * \u0003 P(a` ,b` ) , and therefore\n\u0001\nfdim(G) \u2264 fdim P(a1 ,b1 ) \u0003 P(a2 ,b2 ) \u0003 * * * \u0003 P(a` ,b` ) .\nSince Corollary 3.5 implies\nfdim P(a1 ,b1 ) \u0003 P(a2 ,b2 ) \u0003 * * * \u0003 P(a` ,b` ) =\n\u0001\n\n`\nX\n\n!\nfdim(P(ai ,bi ) )\n\n+ (` \u2212 1)\n\ni=1\n\n=\n\n!\n`\nX\n(bi \u2212 ai ) + (` \u2212 1)\ni=1\n\n= idim(G) + ldim(G) \u2212 1,\nwe conclude that fdim(G) \u2264 idim(G) + ldim(G) \u2212 1.\n\n\u0003\n\nProposition 3.8 Let G be a partial cube. Then ldim(G) \u2264 dfdim(G)/2e.\nProof. Consider the Fibonacci cube \u0393f for f \u2265 3, and let u\u2217 denote the last f \u2212 2 entries\nof each tuple u \u2208 V (\u0393f ). Define an embedding \u03b2 of \u0393f into Z1 \u0003 \u0393f \u22122 by\n\uf8f1\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2(0, u ) if u = 01u ;\n\u03b2(u) = (1, u\u2217 ) if u = 00u\u2217 ;\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n(2, u\u2217 ) if u = 10u\u2217 .\nIt is straightforward to see that \u03b2 is an isometric embedding. Using induction on the\nFibonacci dimension, with base cases ldim(\u03931 ) = ldim(\u03932 ) = 1, we obtain\nldim(\u0393f ) \u2264 1 + ldim(\u0393f \u22122 ) \u2264 1 + d(f \u2212 2)/2e = df /2e.\nIf a partial cube isometrically embeds into \u0393f , we then have ldim(G) \u2264 ldim(\u0393f ) \u2264 df /2e,\nand the result follows.\n\u0003\nFor graphs with low lattice dimension, we may determine the Fibonacci dimension\nexactly:\nProposition 3.9 Suppose that ldim(G) = 2. Then fdim(G) = idim(G) + i, where i = 1\nwhen G is isomorphic to the Cartesian product of two paths and i = 0 otherwise.\nProof. When G is isomorphic to the product of two paths, the result follows from Corollaries 3.5 and 3.6. Otherwise, G is a proper subgraph of P1 \u0003 P2 , where P1 and P2 are\ntwo paths with total length equal to idim(G). Among the four corner vertices of P1 \u0003 P2\ndetermined by pairs of endpoints of the two paths, at least one corner must be absent in\nG if G is to be a proper subgraph of the product of paths; we may assume without loss\n9\n\n\fof generality that this missing corner corresponds to the last vertex of P1 and the first\nvertex of P2 .\nWe may embed P1 isometrically into a Fibonacci cube (following Corollary 3.6) using\nthe coordinates\n101010 . . . , 001010 . . . , 000010 . . . ,\n\n...,\n\n. . . 010000, . . . 010100, . . . 010101\n\nwhen P1 has even length, or with a similar pattern when P1 has odd length. That is, we\nstart with an alternating sequence of zeros and ones, remove the ones one at a time, and\nthen add ones one at a time to end with the opposite alternating sequence of ones and\nzeros. This pattern can be chosen in such a way that the final coordinate is zero for all\nvertices of P1 except for its the last vertex. Similarly, we may embed P2 isometrically\ninto a set of Fibonacci strings in such a way that the initial coordinate is zero except in\nthe first vertex of P2 . Concatenating these two representations of positions in P1 and P2\nproduces an irredundant isometric embedding of G into a Fibonacci cube.\n\u0003\n\n4\n\nAlgorithmic aspects\n\n4.1\n\nBad news\n\nWe show that it is NP-complete to decide if the isometric and the Fibonacci dimension\nof a given graph is the same. Furthermore, we show that it is NP-hard to approximate\nthe Fibonacci dimension within (741/740) \u2212 \u03b5, for any constant \u000f > 0.\nLet G be a graph with n vertices. We assume for simplicity that V (G) = [n], and use\na, b to refer to the vertices of G. Let \u1e20 be the complementary graph of G.\nLemma 4.1 Let H be either the simplex graph \u03ba(G) or the 2-simplex graph \u03ba2 (G). Then\nH is a partial cube with idim(H) = n.\nProof. Consider the embedding \u03b2 : H \u2192 Qn given as follows:\n\u2022 for u\u2205 we set \u03b2(u\u2205 ) = u(1) . . . u(n) with u(i) = 0 for all i \u2208 [n];\n\u2022 for each a \u2208 [n] we set \u03b2(ua ) = u(1) . . . u(n) with u(a) = 1 and u(i) = 0 for all\ni \u2208 [n] \\ {a};\nP\n\u2022 for each node uK of H, we set \u03b2(uK ) = a\u2208K \u03b2(ua ).\nSee Figure 6 for an example when H = \u03ba(G). It is straightforward to see that \u03b2 is\nan isometric embedding of H into Qn , and hence H is a partial cube. Moreover, \u03b2 is\nirredundant: \u03b2 (i) (ua ) is nonzero if and only if a 6= i. Since there is an irredundant\nisometric embedding of a graph H into Qk if and only if idim(H) = k, it follows that\nidim(H) = n.\n\u0003\nIn fact, stronger result that Lemma 4.1 was proved in [2] for \u03ba(G) and in [32] for\n\u03ba2 (G): H is a median graph.\nLemma 4.2 Let H be either the simplex graph \u03ba(G) or the 2-simplex graph \u03ba2 (G). There\nis a set W of semicubes of H with the following properties:\n(a) Each node in W has degree zero in X(H).\n10\n\n\f001101\n\n100010\n\n100000\n\n010010\n\n010000\n\n001100\n\n001000\n\n001010\n\n000100\n\n001001\n\n000010\n\n000101\n\n000001\n\n000000\n\nFigure 6: Isometric embedding of \u03ba(G) for the graph G of Figure 3, left.\n(b) Each pair of complementary semicubes of H has a node in W.\n(c) X(H) \u2212 W is isomorphic to \u1e20.\nProof. We will use the isometric embedding \u03b2 given in the proof of Lemma 4.1. For any\na \u2208 [n] we then have the semicubes\nW(a,0) = {uK \u2208 V (H) | \u03b2 (a) (uK ) = 0}\n= {uK \u2208 V (H) | a is not a vertex in K},\nand\nW(a,1) = {uK \u2208 V (H) | \u03b2 (a) (uK ) = 1}\n= {uK \u2208 V (H) | a is a vertex in K}.\nLet us now consider the graph X(H). See Figure 7 for an example. The node set of X(H)\nis W(a,\u03c7) , (a, \u03c7) \u2208 [n] \u00d7 {0, 1}. For the edge set, we have the following properties:\n\u2022 There is no edge between W(a,0) and W(b,0) because u\u2205 \u2208 W(a,0) \u2229 W(b,0) .\n\u2022 There is no edge between W(a,0) and W(b,1) because ub \u2208 W(a,0) \u2229 W(b,1) .\n\u2022 There is an edge between W(a,1) and W(b,1) if and only if ab \u2208\n/ E(G). Indeed, there\nis a vertex uK of H in W(a,1) \u2229 W(b,1) if and only if a and b are vertices in the clique\nK, which happens precisely when ab is an edge of G. Therefore W(a,1) \u2229 W(b,1) 6= \u2205\nif and only if ab \u2208 E(G).\nIt follows that each node W(a,0) , a \u2208 [n], has degree zero in X(H). Therefore, the\nsubfamily of nodes W = {W(a,0) | a \u2208 [n]} of X(H) satisfies properties (a) and (b) in the\nlemma. The graph X(G) \u2212 W contains only the nodes W(a,1) , a \u2208 [n]. Since there is an\nedge between W(a,1) and W(b,1) if and only if ab \u2208\n/ E(G), the mapping a 7\u2192 W(a,1) is an\nisomorphism between \u1e20, and property (c) follows.\n\u0003\nLet (1, 2)-TSP denote the (metric) symmetric Traveling Salesman Problem in which all\ndistances are either 1 or 2. The (1, 2)-TSP problem is NP-hard.

On the positive side, Berman and Karpinski [6]\nhave given an (8/7)-approximation algorithm for (1, 2)-TSP.\nAny graph G naturally defines an instance IG of (1, 2)-TSP, where the points of the\nmetric space are the vertices of G, and the distance between two points is 1 if there is\nan edge between them in G, and 2 otherwise. Let `(IG ) denote the length of the optimal\ntour for an instance IG of (1, 2)-TSP.\nFor later use, it will be convenient to exchange now the roles of G and its complementary graph \u1e20.\nLemma 4.3 Let H be either the simplex graph \u03ba(\u1e20) or the 2-simplex graph \u03ba2 (\u1e20). The\ngraph G has a Hamiltonian path if and only if fdim(H) = n. If G does not have a\nHamiltonian path, then fdim(H) = `(IG ) \u2212 1.\nProof. Consider the set of nodes W in X(H) given by Lemma 4.2. Since each node of W\nhas degree zero in X(H) and W contains one semicube from each pair of complementary\nsemicubes of H, we can just disregard the nodes W for finding the value p(X(H)). When\nwe disregard the nodes W, we obtain X(H) \u2212 W, which is isomorphic to G because of\nproperty (c) in Lemma 4.2. (Recall we exchanged the roles of G and \u1e20.) It follows that\np(X(H)) is the minimum number of vertex-disjoint paths that are needed to cover each\nvertex of G.\nThe graph G has a Hamiltonian path if and only if p(X(H)) = 1. Using Theorem 3.3\nand Lemma 4.1, this is equivalent to\nfdim(H) = idim(H) + p(X(H)) \u2212 1 = idim(H) = n.\n12\n\n\fIf G does not have a Hamiltonian path, then `(IG ) is |V (G)| = n plus the minimum\nnumber of vertex-disjoint paths that are needed to cover each vertex of G. Thus `(IG ) =\nn + p(X(H)). Using Theorem 3.3 and Lemma 4.1 we conclude that\nfdim(H) = idim(H) + p(X(H)) \u2212 1 = n + p(X(H)) \u2212 1 = `(IG ) \u2212 1.\n\u0003\nWe next show that computing the Fibonacci dimension, or even to approximate it, is\nNP-hard.\nTheorem 4.4 It is NP-complete to decide if idim(H) = fdim(H) for a given graph H.\nProof. Note that idim(H) can be computed in polynomial time [1, 17, 30]. Therefore, an\nexplicit isometric embedding of H into \u0393idim(H) would be enough to check in polynomial\ntime that idim(H) = fdim(H). It follows that the problem is in the class NP.\nTo show hardness, consider the graph H = \u03ba2 (\u1e20). It is clear that H can be constructed\nin polynomial time for any given graph G; this is not necessarily true for \u03ba(\u1e20) if \u1e20 has large\ncliques. Lemma 4.3 implies that idim(H) = fdim(H) if and only if G has a Hamiltonian\npath. Since deciding whether a graph has a Hamiltonian path is NP-complete [22], it is\nNP-hard to decide whether idim(H) = fdim(H).\n\u0003\nTheorem 4.5 It is NP-hard to approximate the Fibonacci dimension of a graph within\n(741/740) \u2212 \u03b5 for every constant \u03b5 > 0.\nProof. Assume that there is a constant \u03b5 > 0 and a polynomial time algorithm ApproxFib that, for any input graph H, computes a value f 0 (H) such that\n\u0001\n741\nfdim(H) \u2264 f 0 (H) \u2264 740\n\u2212 \u03b5 fdim(H).\nGiven any graph G with n vertices, we can apply algorithm ApproxFib to the graph\nH = \u03ba2 (\u1e20) to obtain a value f 0 that satisfies\n\u0001\n741\nfdim(H) \u2264 f 0 \u2264 740\n\u2212 \u03b5 fdim(H).\n(1)\nConsider the value `0 = f 0 + 1 as an approximation to `(IG ).\nFrom Lemma 4.3 it follows that\n`(IG ) \u2212 1 \u2264 fdim(H) \u2264 `(IG ).\n\n(2)\n\n(There is the special case when G has a Hamiltonian cycle because then `(IG ) = n =\nfdim(H).) Combining inequalities (1) and (2) we obtain\n`(IG ) \u2264 fdim(H) + 1 \u2264 f 0 + 1 = `0 ,\nand\n`0 = f 0 + 1\n\u0001\n\u2212 \u03b5 fdim(H) + 1\n\u0001\n\u2264\n\u2212 \u03b5 `(IG ) + 1\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n= 741\n+\n\u2212\n\u03b5\n`(IG )\n740\n`(IG )\n\u0001\n1\n\u2264 741\n740 + n \u2212 \u03b5 `(IG ).\n\u2264\n\n741\n740\n741\n740\n\n13\n\n\fSince 2/\u03b5 is a constant, we may assume that G has more than 2/\u03b5 vertices, and thus\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1\n741\n\u03b5\n`(IG ) \u2264 `0 \u2264 741\n740 + n \u2212 \u03b5 `(IG ) \u2264 740 \u2212 2 `(IG ).\nWe then conclude that `0 can be computed in polynomial time and approximates the\nvalue `(IG ) within (741/740) \u2212 (\u03b5/2). However, Engebretsen and Karpinski [14] have\nshown that it is NP-hard to approximate the (1, 2)-TSP within (741/740) \u2212 \u03b4 for every\nconstant \u03b4 > 0. Therefore, it is also NP-hard to approximate the Fibonacci dimension of\na graph within (741/740) \u2212 \u03b5 for every constant \u03b5 > 0.\n\u0003\n\n4.2\n\nGood news\n\nWe first provide an exact algorithm to compute fdim(G) whose running time is exponential\nin idim(G). We then provide a (3/2)-approximation algorithm for arbitrary graphs, and\nbetter approximation algorithms specialized to simplex graphs.\nWe assume that our input is a partial cube G with n vertices and also that we are given\nan embedding \u03b2 of G into Qk , where k = idim(G). Such embedding can be constructed in\nO(n2 ) time [17]1 . We first describe how to construct X(G) and then give an algorithmic\ncounterpart of Lemma 3.2.\nLemma 4.6 The graph X(G) can be computed in O(k 2 n) time.\nProof. Each semicube W(i,\u03c7) is identified by a pair (i, \u03c7) \u2208 [k] \u00d7 {0, 1}. We first construct\nthe complete graph on the node set {(i, \u03c7) \u2208 [k] \u00d7 {0, 1}} and then, for each vertex\nv \u2208 V (G), the edges (i, \u03b2 (i) (v))(j, \u03b2 (j) (v)) are removed for all distinct i, j \u2208 [k]. The\nresulting graph is (isomorphic to) X(G). Using any standard data structure for graphs,\neach edge can be deleted in constant time. For each of the n vertices of G, we thus spend\nO(k 2 ) time, for a total of O(k 2 n) time.\n\u0003\nLemma 4.7 Assume we are given a system of p coordinating paths of X(G). Then we\ncan compute in O(kn) time an isometric embedding of G into \u0393f 0 , where f 0 = k + p \u2212 1 .\nProof. The proof given in Lemma 3.2 is constructive and can be implemented in O(n(k +\np)) = O(kn) time.\n\u0003\nFrom X(G) it is possible to compute p(X(G)), and thus fdim(G), in roughly O(k!)\ntime by trying all permutations of the indices [k] to obtain systems of coordinating paths\nof X(G). We next improve this to a dependency that is exponential in k.\nProposition 4.8 Given a partial cube G with n vertices and an isometric embedding\nG \u2192 Qk , where k = idim(G), we can compute in O(2k k 2 + k 2 n) time an isometric\nembedding of G in \u0393f , where f = fdim(G).\nProof. Firstly, we construct the graph X(G) using Lemma 4.6 in O(k 2 n) time. Secondly,\nwe find in O(2k k 2 ) time a system of coordinating paths of X(G) with minimum size using\ndynamic programming, as described below. Finally, we use Lemma 4.7 to construct the\nembedding in O(kn) time. We only have to describe the second step.\n1\nThe algorithm in [17] assumes the word-RAM model of computation. Without bit-manipulation,\nthere are algorithms [1, 30] taking O(n2 log n) time.\n\n14\n\n\fWe compute the value p(X(G)) using dynamic programming across subsets of pairs of\ncomplementary semicubes, as follows. Our approach is essentially the same as a standard\none for TSP [5, 26]. For any subset of indices I \u2286 [k], let XI (G) denote the subgraph of\nX(G) induced by nodes W(i,0) , W(i,1) , i \u2208 I. For any triple (I, j, \u03c7) \u2208 2[n] \u00d7 [n] \u00d7 {0, 1}\nwith j \u2208 I, let \u03c0(I, j, \u03c7) denote the minimum number of paths in a system of coordinating\npaths for XI (G), with the property that W(j,\u03c7) is an end-node of some coordinating\npath. That is, \u03c0(I, j, \u03c7) is the minimum number of paths in X(G) that visit each pair\nof complementary semicubes W(i,0) , W(i,0) , i \u2208 I, exactly once, it has one path ending at\nnode W(j,\u03c7) , and does not visit any semicube W(i,\u2217) for i \u2208\n/ I.\nIt is clear that for any j \u2208 [k] it holds \u03c0({j}, j, 0) = \u03c0({j}, j, 1) = 1. For subsets I\nwith more than one index there are two cases to distinguish, depending on whether the\npaths defining \u03c0(I, j, \u03c7) have W(j,\u03c7) as an isolated node or not. Therefore it holds\n\n\u03c0(I, j, \u03c7) = min\n\n\uf8f1\nmin\n\u03c0(I \\ {j}, j 0 , \u03c70 )\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f41 + (j 0 ,\u03c70 )\u2208(I\\{j})\u00d7{0,1}\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\nmin\n\u03c0(I \\ {j}, j 0 , \u03c70 )\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n0\n0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 (j , \u03c7 ) \u2208 (I \\ {j}) \u00d7 {0, 1} s.t.\nW(j,\u03c7) W(j 0 ,\u03c70 ) \u2208 E(X(G))\n\nNote that \u03c0(I, j, \u03c7) only depends on values \u03c0(I 0 , j 0 , \u03c70 ) with |I 0 | = |I| \u2212 1. Therefore,\nwe can compute all values \u03c0(I, j, \u03c7) by considering them for increasing values of |I|,\nat a cost of O(k) per value. Since there are at most |2[k] | * |[k]| * 2 = O(2k k) tuples\n(I, j, \u03c7) to consider, we can compute in O(2k k 2 ) time the values \u03c0(I, j, \u03c7) for all tuples\n(I, j, \u03c7) \u2208 2[n] \u00d7 [k] \u00d7 {0, 1} with j \u2208 I. Finally, it holds that\np(X(G)) =\n\nmin\n\n(j,\u03c7)\u2208[n]\u00d7{0,1}\n\n\u03c0([n], j, \u03c7),\n\nand hence we can recover p(X(G)) in O(k) time. To obtain the actual system of coordinating paths, we only need to augment each entry (I, j, \u03c7) with a list of the paths that\ndefine \u03c0(I, j, \u03c7).\n\u0003\nWe next move onto approximation algorithms. Note that the value idim(G)+ldim(G)\u2212\n1 is a (3/2)-approximation to the value fdim(G) because of Propositions 3.7 and 3.8. Moreover, the proofs of Propositions 3.7 and 3.8 are constructive, and therefore we can use\nisometric embeddings of G into Qidim(G) and into Zldim(G) to construct an isometric embedding of G into \u0393idim(G)+ldim(G)\u22121 . Since an isometric embedding of G into Zldim(G) can\nbe computed in polynomial time [16], we can then compute in polynomial time an embedding of G into \u0393f 0 for f 0 \u2264 (3/2)fdim(G). We next give an alternative algorithm with\nthe same performance (time and approximation factor) that does not make the detour\nthrough finding an isometric embedding into Zldim(G) .\nTheorem 4.9 Given a partial cube G with n vertices and an isometric embedding G \u2192\nQk , where k = idim(G), we can compute in O(k 2 n) time an isometric embedding of G in\n\u0393f 0 , where f 0 \u2264 (3/2)fdim(G).\nProof. We first describe the algorithm, then derive its running time, and finally discuss\nthe bound on the dimension of the computed embedding.\nThe algorithm is as follows. Firstly, construct the graph X(G). Secondly, construct\nthe graph Y (G) obtained from X(G) by identifying each pair of complementary semicubes\ninto a single node. Hence, Y (G) has k nodes. Thirdly, construct a matching MY in Y (G)\n15\n\n\fof maximum cardinality. Let MX denote the matching in X(G) that corresponds to MY .\nWe can then regard each edge of MX as a path in X(G) that passes through two nodes. Let\nP1 , . . . , P|MX | denote these paths. There are precisely k \u2212 2|MX | pairs of complementary\nsemicubes that are not adjacent to MX . For each of those pairs, we make a path consisting\nof a single semicube of the pair. This gives a family of |MX |+(k\u22122|MX |) = k\u2212|MX | paths\nthat form a system of coordinating paths of X(G). Finally, we compute the embedding\ninto \u0393f 0 given by Lemma 4.7, where\nf 0 = k + (k \u2212 |MX |) \u2212 1 = 2k \u2212 |MX | \u2212 1.\n\n(3)\n\nThis finishes the description of the algorithm. Clearly, this algorithm computes a valid\nembedding of G into \u0393f 0 .\nTo derive its running time, note that X(G) is constructed in O(k 2 n) time by Lemma 4.6.\nWe can then construct Y (G) by identifying the nodes (i, 0) and (i, 1) of X(G) for all i \u2208 [d].\nFinding a maximum matching MY in Y (G) takes O(k 5/2 ) time using [39] because Y (G)\nhas k nodes and O(k 2 ) edges. From MY we can recover the matching MX in X(G),\nand construct the embedding using Lemma 4.7 in O(kn) time. We conclude that the\nalgorithms takes O(k 5/2 + k 2 n) time, which is O(k 2 n) because k \u2264 n.\nIt remains to bound f 0 . Let p = p(X(G)) and let P1 , P2 , . . . Pp be a system of coordinating paths of X(G). Consider these paths in Y (G), and let EP denote the set of edges\nappearing in P1 , P2 , . . . Pp . It holds that\np = k \u2212 |EP |.\n\n(4)\n\nTaking each other edge in the path Pi , we see that Pi contains a matching with d|E(Pi )|/2e\nedges. Thus the paths P1 , . . . Pp in Y (G) contain a matching with at least |EP |/2 edges.\nWe conclude that\n|EP |\n|MX | = |MY | \u2265\n.\n(5)\n2\nCombining equations (3)-(5) we obtain\nf 0 = 2k \u2212 |MX | \u2212 1\n|EP |\n\u2264 2k \u2212\n\u22121\n2\nk\u2212p\n= 2k \u2212\n\u22121\n2\n3\n1\n= (k + p \u2212 1) \u2212 p +\n2\n2\n3\n\u2264 (fdim(G)),\n2\nwhere in the last step we have used Theorem 3.3.\n\n\u0003\n\nWe now turn our attention to approximation algorithms for simplex graphs.\nTheorem 4.10 Let \u03b5 \u2208 (0, 1) be a constant. Given a simplex graph H with n vertices\nand an isometric embedding H \u2192 Qk , where k = idim(H), we can compute in O(n2+1/\u03b5 )\ntime an isometric embedding of H in \u0393f 0 , where f 0 \u2264 (1 + \u03b5)fdim(H).\nProof. Since H is a simplex graph, then H = \u03ba(G) for some graph G. It holds k =\nidim(H) = |V (G)| because of Lemma 4.1. The graph X(H) can be constructed in O(k 2 n)\ntime by Lemma 4.6. We can construct the set of nodes W of Lemma 4.2 by placing in W,\n16\n\n\ffor each i \u2208 [k], either W(i,0) or W(i,1) , whichever has degree zero in X(G). By property\n(c) of Lemma 4.2 it holds that X(H) \u2212 W and \u1e20 are isomorphic.\nWe construct a system of coordinating paths of X(H) with the following greedy procedure. We start with a system of k coordinating paths P = {P1 , . . . , Pk }, where each\npath consists of a node from V (X(H)) \\ W. Then, we repeat the following step as many\ntimes as possible: if there are paths P, P 0 \u2208 P that can be joined by adding an edge\nbetween two of its extreme nodes, we do so, and replace in P the paths P, P 0 by the new\npath. This step may be repeated at most k \u2212 1 times, in which case we end up with a\nsingle path in P. Since each repetition of the step takes O(k 2 ) time, the whole procedure\nneeds O(k 3 ) time. Let P denote the resulting system of coordinating paths.\nWe distinguish two cases depending on the size of P. If |P| \u2264 \u03b5k, then we can use\nLemma 4.7 with P to construct an embedding of H into \u0393f 0 , where f 0 \u2264 k + |P| \u2212 1 \u2264\n(1 + \u03b5)k \u2264 (1 + \u03b5)fdim(H). If |P| > \u03b5k, then by selecting an extreme node in each path\nof P we obtain in X(G) \u2212 W an independent set of nodes of cardinality at least \u03b5k. Since\nX(G) \u2212 W and \u1e20 are isomorphic, this means that \u1e20 has an independent set with at least\n\u03b5k vertices, and hence G has a clique K with at least \u03b5k vertices. Since the input graph\nH is the simplex graph of G, we conclude that H has at least 2|K| \u2265 2\u03b5k vertices; that is\nn \u2265 2\u03b5k . Using Proposition 4.8, we can then compute an isometric embedding of H into\n\u0393fdim(H) in\n\u0012\u0010 \u0011\n\u0013\n\u0011\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0010\n1/\u03b5\nk 2\n2\n\u03b5k\n2\n3\nO(2 k + k n) = O\n2\nn + n = O n1/\u03b5 n2 + n3 = O n2+1/\u03b5\n\u0001\ntime. In either case, we obtain in O n2+1/\u03b5 time an isometric embedding of H into \u0393f 0 ,\nwhere f 0 \u2264 (1 + \u03b5)fdim(H).\n\u0003\nNote that the last result takes time polynomial in the size of the given simplex graph.\nHowever, we could consider that the simplex graph \u03ba(G) is described by G, and give G\nas the input. The following result approximates the Fibonacci dimension of \u03ba(G) for a\ngiven graph G in time that is polynomial in the size of G. Note that we cannot compute\nan explicit isometric embedding of \u03ba(G) in polynomial time of because the size of \u03ba(G)\nmay be exponential in G.\nTheorem 4.11 Let \u03b5 \u2208 (0, 1) be a constant. Given a graph G with n vertices, we can\ncompute in polynomial time a value f 0 such that fdim(\u03ba(G)) \u2264 f 0 \u2264 ( 78 + \u03b5)fdim(\u03ba(G)).\nProof. If G has less than 1/\u03b5 vertices, which is a constant, we can then compute\nfdim(\u03ba(G)) exactly in constant time. Let us assume henceforth that G has at least 1/\u03b5\nvertices.\nFrom Lemma 4.3 it follows that fdim(\u03ba(G)) = `(I\u1e20 ) \u2212 1 if \u1e20 does not have a Hamiltonian cycle, and fdim(\u03ba(G)) = n = `(I\u1e20 ) if \u1e20 has a Hamiltonian cycle. Berman and\nKarpinski [6] describe a polynomial-time (8/7)-approximation algorithm for (1, 2)-TSP.\nLet `0 be the (8/7)-approximation to the value `(I\u1e20 ) returned by their algorithm. If `0 = n,\nthen \u1e20 has a Hamiltonian cycle, and fdim(\u03ba(G)) = n. If `0 > n, consider f 0 = `0 \u2212 1 as\nan approximation to fdim(\u03ba(G)). For f 0 we have the upper bound\nf 0 = `0 \u2212 1 \u2264\n\n8\n7 `(I\u1e20 )\n\n\u22121 \u2264\n\n8\n7 (`(I\u1e20 )\n\n\u2212 1) +\n\n1\n7\n\n\u2264\n\n8\n7 fdim(\u03ba(G))\n\n+ 17 ,\n\nwhich using that n\u03b5 \u2265 1 and n \u2264 fdim(\u03ba(G)) leads to\nf0 \u2264\n\n8\n7 fdim(\u03ba(G))\n\n+\n\n\u03b5n\n7\n\n\u2264\n\n8\n7 fdim(\u03ba(G))\n\n17\n\n+ \u03b5fdim(\u03ba(G)) \u2264 ( 78 + \u03b5)fdim(\u03ba(G)).\n\n\fOn the other hand, for f 0 we also have the lower bound\nfdim(\u03ba(G)) = max{n, `(I\u1e20 ) \u2212 1} \u2264 max{n, `0 \u2212 1} = `0 \u2212 1 = f 0 .\nThe result follows.\n\n\u0003\n\nBy Lemma 4.3 it holds that fdim(\u03ba(G)) = fdim(\u03ba2 (G)), and hence the same result\nholds for the 2-simplex graph \u03ba2 (G).\n\nAcknowledgments\nWork of D.
