Let (X, V ) be a complex directed manifold, Jk V \u2192 X\nis defined to be the bundle of k-jets of germs of curves f : (C, 0) \u2192 X which are tangent to\nV, i.e., such that f \u2032 (t) \u2208 Vf (t) for all t in a neighborhood of 0, together with the projection\nmap f \u2192 f (0) onto X. It is easy to check that Jk V is actually a subbundle of Jk TX . Let\nGk be the group of germs of k-jet biholomorphisms of (C, 0), that is, the group of germs of\nbiholomorphic maps\nt \u2192 \u03c6(t) = a1 t + a2 t2 + * * * + ak tk ,\n\na1 \u2208 C\u2217 , aj \u2208 C,\n\nj>2\n\nj\n\nin which the composition law is taken modulo terms t of degree j > k. The group Gk acts\non the left on Jk V by reparametrization, (\u03c6, f ) \u2192 f \u25e6 \u03c6.\nGiven a directed manifold (X, V ) with rankV = r, let X\u0303 = P(V ). The subbundle \u1e7c \u2282 TX\u0303\nis defined by\n\u1e7cx,[v] = {\u03be \u2208 TX\u0303,(x,[v]) |\u03c0\u2217 \u03be \u2208 C * v}\nfor any x \u2208 X and any v \u2208 TX,x \\{0}. Starting with a directed manifold (X, V ) = (X0 , V0 ),\nwe get a tower of directed manifolds (Xk , Vk ), called Demailly-Semple k-jet bundle of X,\ndefined by Xk = X\u0303k\u22121 , Vk = \u1e7ck\u22121 . In particular, when X is a hypersurface in CP3 , we start\nwith (X, TX )\nThe line bundle OXk (1) will be called the Demailly-Semple k\u2212jet line bundle.\nTheorem 0.1. [De97] The direct image sheaf (\u03c0k,0 )\u2217 OXk (m) on X coincides with the (locally\nfree) sheaf Ek,m V \u2217 of k-jet differentials of weighted degree m, that is, by definition, the set\nof germs of polynomial differential operators\nX\nQ(f ) =\na\u03b11 ***\u03b1k (f )(f \u2032 )\u03b11 (f \u2032\u2032 )\u03b12 * * * (f (k) )\u03b1k\n(1)\n\u03b11 ***\u03b1k\n\non Jk V (in multi-index notation, (f \u2032 )\u03b11 = ((f1\u2032 )\u03b11,1 (f2\u2032 )\u03b11,2 * * * (fr\u2032 )\u03b11,r ), which are moreover\ninvariant under arbitrary changes of parametrization: a germ of operator Q \u2208 Ek,m V \u2217 is\ncharacterized by the condition that, for every germ f \u2208 Jk V and every germ \u03c6 \u2208 Gk ,\nQ(f \u25e6 \u03c6) = \u03c6\u2032m Q(f ) \u25e6 \u03c6\nGiven a finit dimensional vector space W , we can define Ek,m W \u2217 . Seeing that W can be\nseen as the tangent space of its own, we define Ek,m W \u2217 to be the fibre at the origin of the\n\u2217\nbundle Ek,m TW\n. More generally, if we have a vector bundle V of finite rank over a manifold\nDate: November 4, 2018.\nResearch partially supported by NSF grant DMS-0901333.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nJINGZHOU SUN\n\nX. Let G be the structure group of V , and let P be the principle bundle of V . We denote a\nfibre by W . An element g \u2208 G acts on W , inducing an automorphism of Ek,m W \u2217 . Therefore,\nwe get a representation of G in Ek,m W \u2217 . We can define\n\u1ebck,m V \u2217 , P \u00d7G Ek,m W \u2217\nHowever when V is a subboudle of TX , this vector bundle does NOT coincide with the\noriginal definition of Ek,m V \u2217 . One can have a sense of this by taking a collection of covering\ncharts of X such that V is trivial on each open set. Consider V1 as a fiber bundle over X\nwith each fiber a vector bundle of rank r over CPr\u22121 . One can then compute the transition\nfunctions of V1 on overlap of intersecting charts, and see that the second derivatives of the\ntransition functions of X are involved. The following example shows Ek,m V \u2217 is indeed not a\nrepresentation of the principle bundle of V .\nSuppose X is a surface, and V = TX . In a neighborhood of a point x \u2208 X such that TX is\ntrivial, one can easily compute that E2,3 TX\u2217 |x as a representation of GL(TX,x ) decomposes as a\n\u2217\ndirect sum S 3 TX,x\n\u2295KX,x . If E2,3 TX\u2217 = P\u00d7GLTX,x E2,3 TX\u2217 |x , this decomposition will globalize to\ngive a decomposition E2,3 TX\u2217 = S 3 TX\u2217 \u2295KX . But then we will have H 0 (X, E2,3 TX\u2217 \u2297(\u2212KX )) 6=\n0\nRecall that in [DeE] \u03b8k,m is defined to be the smallest rational number such that H 0 (X, Ek,m TX\u2217 \u2297\n(tKX )) 6= 0 , assuming tKX is an integral divisor, t \u2208 Q. Under our assumption, we get that\n\u03b82,3 \u2264 \u2212 31 . On the other hand, the following inequality was proved in [DeE]\nProposition 0.2. [DeE] Let X be a generic surface of degree d \u2265 6 in CP3 . Then\n\u22121 2 \u2212 7/(2m)\n+\n, f or m = 3, 4, 5\n\u03b82,m \u2265\n2m\nd\u22124\nWe get a contradiction.\nThis example gives us the impression that the global structure of Ek,m TX\u2217 is complicated.\nTherefore, knowing the local structure of Ek,m TX\u2217 does not enable one to get global conclusions before one understand the transition functions for Ek,mTX\u2217 on overlaps of open covering\nof X.\nReferences\n[De97]\n\n[DeE]\n\nJean-Pierre Demailly, Algebraic criteria for Kobayashi hyperbolic projective varieties and jet differentials.
