While in (In,Mn)Sb\nconventional Andreev reflection has been demonstrated, in (Ga,Mn)As quasiparticle\ndensity of states (DOS) broadening has been observed, possibly due to inelastic scattering\neffects. Here, we investigate the spin polarization, magnetic, and transport properties of\nepitaxially grown (Ga,Mn)Sb films with the Curie temperature of ~ 10K. The spin\npolarization of 57\u00b15% was measured. Spectrum broadening in (Ga,Mn)Sb has also been\nobserved.\n\n1\n\n\fThe electronic spin rather than charge can bring to life many fundamentally different\ndevices, going beyond conventional semiconductor-based electronics.1,2 While it is\npossible to use metals as spin injectors and detectors, the building blocks of these\ndevices, it is much more natural, even from a purely fabrication standpoint, to use allsemiconductor systems. This is one of the main reasons dilute magnetic semiconductor\n(DMS) III-Mn-V compounds3 have emerged as one of the most important classes of\nmaterials in semiconductor spintronics. (Ga,Mn)As4,5 and related compounds are\nparticularly well-matched with GaAs, traditionally used in electronic industry. However,\nwhile there have been extensive studies aimed at increasing their Curie temperature, TC, it\nis still significantly lower than room temperature. In (Ga,Mn)N6 TC has been predicted to\nexceed 300K,7 but these DMS compounds typically have higher resistivity and thus are\nnot well-suited as spin injectors.\nThe narrow gap materials, such as (In,Mn)Sb8 and (Ga,Mn)Sb9 are much less\nthoroughly investigated. In spite of their low TC, these compounds have potential\napplications in spin dependent photonics, such as infrared or far-infrared devices, as well\nas in carrier-mediated spin dependent transport due to the presence of lighter, high\nmobility holes. As the effectiveness of a spintronic device is, to a large extent, dependent\non the spin polarization P of the spin injector,10 it is important to determine the values of\nP for this class of DMS materials. The spin polarization of (In,Mn)Sb epitaxial film has\nrecently been measured11 by the Point Contact Andreev Reflection (PCAR)\ntechnique.12,13 In this letter we report the measurements of the spin polarization of\n(Ga,Mn)Sb thin films epitaxially grown on GaAs substrates, with P evaluated to be\n57\u00b15%.\n\n2\n\n\fPCAR has recently been introduced as a technique to measure the transport spin\npolarization of various magnetic materials. In a normal metal/superconductor (N/S)\njunction, a quasiparticle with the energy less than the superconducting gap, \u2206, can\nconvert into a Cooper pair and enter the superconductor by reflecting at the interface as a\nhole with (roughly) the same energy and opposite spin (Andreev reflection). In a\nferromagnet (F) due to the spin-imbalance not every spin-up channel has the equivalent\nspin-down channel, leading to a partial suppression of Andreev reflection in the F/S\njunction, which can be detected from the conductance measurements. The spin\npolarization is given by Pn =\n\n< N \u2191 ( E f )v nf \u2191 > \u2212 < N \u2193 ( E f )v n f \u2193 >\n< N \u2191 ( E f )v n f \u2191 > + < N \u2193 ( E f ) v n f \u2193 >\n\n, with n = 1 in the\n\nballistic and n = 2 in diffusive limits, where N \u2191 (E f ) and N \u2193 (E f ) are the density of states\n\nand v f \u2191 and v f \u2193 are the Fermi velocities for majority and minority spins respectively. To\ndetermine the spin polarization values the conductance curves are analyzed using the\nmodified BTK model.14\nThe PCAR measurements in semiconductors (Sm) are often somewhat restricted\ndue to the Schottky barrier present at the Sm/superconductor (S) interface. While by\nincreasing the doping concentrations in semiconductors this problem can be\ncircumvented, as has been demonstrated in Ref. 11, there have been very few\nexperimental studies involving Andreev reflection in semiconductors15 or dilute magnetic\nsemiconductors,16,17 compared to more conventional ferromagnetic materials.2 The\nsituation is further complicated by the fact that a comprehensive microscopic theory of\nthe DMS materials must incorporate both Mn disorder and spin-orbit interaction, and has\nyet to be completed. Interestingly, in contrast to (In,Mn)Sb11 evaluating the spin\n\n3\n\n\fpolarization by PCAR for (Ga,Mn)As has not been straightforward17 as additional pairbreaking mechanism, likely to be due to inelastic quasiparticle scattering18 had to be\ntaken into account; very similar to the results recently obtained in lithographically\ndefined nanocontacts with the intentionally introduced Pt layer.19 While the situation in\n(Ga,Mn)As can be further complicated by the unconventional transport mechanism in\nthese alloys, which is likely to involve impurity band scattering,17 these results suggest\nthat there may be a correlation between the carrier mobility in a compound and inelastic\nscattering rate. (Ga,Mn)Sb is a good candidate to further test this hypothesis, as its carrier\nmobility is intermediate between (In,Mn)Sb and (Ga,Mn)As.\nIn order to make point contacts with (Ga,Mn)Sb mechanically polished sharp tips\nof Pb and Sn, with the superconducting transition temperatures Tc ~ 7.2 K and ~ 3.7 K\nrespectively, were used. The conductance curves were measured by the standard lock-indetection method at 2 kHz. The details of the experimental technique can be found in\nRef. 20. The experimental curves were then fitted using the modified BTK model14 to\nextract the magnitude of spin polarization P and the interfacial barrier strength, Z. The\nspreading resistance of the film,21 determined to be ~5 \u03a9 by the four probe method, was\nincluded in the model in addition to the temperature T and the superconducting gap, \u2206.\nThe (Ga,Mn)Sb films were grown on GaAs at a substrate temperature ~210oC with a 3\n\u03bcm ZnTe buffer layer deposited at 300oC by molecular beam epitaxy. The Mn\nconcentration was ~ 2%, the film thickness ~ 300 nm, and the carrier concentration, n ~ 3\n\u00d7 1020/cm3, similar to (In,Mn)Sb.11 Further details on the growth technique can be found\nin Ref. 9.\n\n4\n\n\fThe magnetization curves of (Ga,Mn)Sb film at different temperatures measured\nby a SQUID magnetometer are shown in Fig.1. The hysteresis loops suggest\nferromagnetic ordering in the film below approximately 10 K. The remnant\nmagnetization curve measured for the magnetic field of ~10 Oe as a function of\ntemperature, shown in the inset of Fig.1, reveals that the Curie temperature, TC is ~10 K.\nThe presence of small magnetization at temperatures above TC is likely to indicate the\npresence of some MnSb precipitates.22 The temperature dependence of the film resistance\ndisplays a corresponding maximum around TC (see Fig.2). Such maxima have been\nobserved in magnetic metals,23 magnetic semiconductors,24 and recently in dilute\nmagnetic semiconductors,25,26 and is believed to be the result of the critical carrier\nscattering due to the spin order-disorder transition.\nA representative conductance curve obtained with a Sn tip is shown in Fig.3. In\norder to account for inelastic broadening which is likely to take place in the\nSn/(Ga,Mn)Sb contact area we used higher effective temperatures in the fitting routine,\nwhich is equivalent to introducing some inelastic quasiparticle broadening \u0393.18,27 This\napproach, however, leads to the increase in the number of free parameters, and as was\nnoted in Ref. 27, one has to be careful to make sure that the fitting procedure in this case\nstill remains stable with respect to small perturbations. To test this we have gradually\nreduced the superconducting gap of Sn from the bulk value of to 0.57 meV to 0.5 meV,\nwhich, as can be seen in Fig. 3b resulted in the change in P of only 1%. Fig. 4 shows the\nnormalized conductance curves for a Pb tip contact at different temperatures for a single\ncontact between the superconducting Pb tip and the (Ga,Mn)Sb film. The low\ntemperature curves are fitted using a superconducting gap, \u2206 ~ 1 meV, which is smaller\n\n5\n\n\fthan the bulk BCS gap of Pb ~ 1.3 meV, possibly due to strong electron-phonon\ncoupling. Similarly to the Sn contacts the effective temperatures used in the fits are\nhigher than the physical temperatures. Importantly, the effective temperatures used to fit\nboth sets of data are very similar and have the lower limit of ~ 4.0 K for all the data with\nT< 3.5 K, which seem to indicate that the main broadening mechanism in this\ntemperature range is inelastic broadening originating from (Ga,Mn)Sb. The average\nmagnitude of spin polarization in (Ga,Mn)Sb using both Sn and Pb was determined to be\n57%\u00b15%.\nUsing the free electron approximation, we estimated the Fermi velocity,\nvf =\n\n=\n(3\u03c0 2 n)1/ 3 , of light (m* ~ 0.06me) and heavy holes (m* ~ 0.3me) to be ~\nm*\n\n1.8 \u00d7 10 6 m / s and 7.8 \u00d7 10 5 m / s respectively. The carrier concentration, n, for light and\nheavy holes was found ~ 2.75 \u00d7 10 20 / cm 3 and 0.25 \u00d7 10 20 / cm 3 , where we used n ~\nnlh+nhh; nlh / nhh ~ (mlh * / mlh *) . We can further estimate the minimum Z values for\n3/ 2\n\nboth light and heavy holes based on the Fermi velocity mismatch between\nsuperconducting Pb, for example, and (Ga,Mn)Sb using Z min = (r \u2212 1) / 2 r where\nr = v Pb / vGaSb .28 The calculated values are Z lh ~ 0.02 and Z hh ~ 0.44. The extracted Z\nvalues have never exceeded 0.02, which, within the accuracy of the model, corresponds\nto a clean interface, indicating the light-hole only contribution to Z.29 Using the Drude\nmodel, we have also estimated the spin relaxation times, 30 \u03c4 = m * / n\u03c1e 2 , where \u03c12K ~\n0.4 m\u03a9.cm (see Fig. 2); \u03c4lh ~ 2.1\u00d710-14 s and \u03c4lh ~ 1\u00d710-14 s yielding the mean free paths,\nl = v f \u03c4 , of llh ~ 38 nm and llh ~ 8 nm. The contact size, d, is determined from Wexler's\n\n6\n\n\fexpression31: Rc ~\n\n4 \u03c1ol \u03c1o\n+\n. For Rc ~75 \u03a9, the contact size ~ 38 nm, so the transport\n3\u03c0 d 2 2d\n\ncorresponds to the ballistic regime for light holes and the intermediate regime for heavy\nholes (lhh ~ d), which is different from the case of (In,Mn)Sb11, where the transport\nregime is ballistic for all types of carriers. It is thus reasonable to assume that in order to\ndescribe (Ga,Mn)Sb, as well as (Ga,Mn)As,17 where the transport is purely diffusive, the\nmodified BTK model14 has to be extended to include inelastic broadening parameter \u0393. 19\n\u0393GaSb can be estimated to be approximately 0.56 meV (Teff ~ 4 K ) and \u0393GaAs ~ 0.77 meV\n(Teff ~5.5 K), where \u0393 = 2Teff . The ratio of the two \u0393GaAs / \u0393GaSb ~ 1.4 can be compared\nto the ratio of the respective band gaps in (Ga,Mn)As and (Ga,Mn)Sb: EGaAs/EGaSb =1.52\neV/0.82 eV =1.85. While this is a fairly crude estimate, there seems a clear correlation\nbetween the degree of inelastic broadening in the S/Sm contacts and the band gap,\nparticularly in view of the fact that (In,Mn)Sb contacts11 with the smallest band gap of\nonly 0.24 eV does not exhibit any noticeable DOS broadening. Importantly, while for\nGaMnAs, P is very sensitive to the effective temperature, yielding a large uncertainty of\n\u00b117%,17 for (Ga,Mn)Sb the uncertainly is just \u00b15%, only slightly inferior to the typical\naccuracy of the PCAR technique.\nIn summary, we have measured the transport spin polarization of (Ga,Mn)Sb\nepitaxially grown films using the PCAR technique. The results for two different\nsuperconductors, Sn and Pb, are quite similar, yielding the average P = 57\u00b15%, a fairly\nrespectable value. The data is analyzed by introducing a generic quasiparticle spectrum\nbroadening, which is likely to be related to inelastic scattering in the S/Sm contacts, as it\nhas recently been reported in the case of Co-Pt-Pb nanocontact,19 and as has been argued\n\n7\n\n\fearlier in the case of (Ga,Mn)As,17 where this effect is even more pronounced due to the\nlarger band gap and lower carrier mobility.\nThe authors thank I.I.

Magnetic hysteresis curves of (Ga,Mn)Sb film measured at different temperatures.\nThe applied field, H, is parallel to the plane of the film. Inset shows in-plane\nmagnetization as a function of temperature obtained at 10 Oe field. Both curves indicate\nthe Curie temperature of ~ 10 K.\nFig.2. Low temperature resistance of the 300 nm thick (Ga,Mn)Sb film. The maximum at\n~9 K is close to the magnetic transition; the estimated resistivity at 2 K ~ 0.4 m\u03a9.cm.\n\nFig.3. Typical normalized conductance curves shown for Sn with a contact resistance of\nRc = 90 \u03a9 at T= 1.2 K. Solid lines are the numerical fits. The effective temperatures are\nTeff = 4.5 K; a) fit with the bulk BCS gap for Sn \u2206 = 0.57 meV. b) fit with the same\ninelastic broadening but a reduced gap \u2206 = 0.5 meV.\nFig.4. Normalized conductance curves for a Pb point contact with Rc = 75 \u03a9 at different\ntemperatures. The solid lines are the numerical fits. Fitting parameters: \u2206 = 1.0 meV, Z =\n0.003 and the average P ~ 57%. The effective temperatures are Teff ~ 4-4.5 K. Inset\nshows the extracted spin polarization values at different temperatures.\n\n12\n\n\f\f\f\f\f"}
