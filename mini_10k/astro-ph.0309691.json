Introduction\nEclipsing binaries are a recognized high performance tool\nto derive fundamental stellar parameters (like masses and\nradii), and as such they play a key astrophysical role\nover the whole HR diagram (cf. Andersen 1991). They\nalso provide a geometrical distance determination, and\ncomparison with Hipparcos parallaxes supports this statement (e.g. Semeniuk 2000). The more accurate the data\nand sophisticated the analysis, the closer the match with\nHipparcos parallaxes, usually within just a few per cent.\nEclipsing binaries also offer the possibility to close the loop\nwith, for example, techniques of synthetic spectroscopy.\nThe synthetic modeling of spectra of SB2 (i.e. lines from\nboth components are visible) eclipsing binaries at quadrature (for ex. via Kurucz, MARCS, NextGen, and other\nfamilies of model atmospheres and synthetic spectra) allows to derive fundamental parameters like temperature\nand surface gravity that can be directly compared with\nthe results of the orbital modeling.\n\nSend offprint requests to: U.Munari, munari@pd.astro.it\n\nWith this paper we begin a series of papers aimed to\npresent the results obtained on a number of SB2 eclipsing\nbinaries selected among those missing a solution in literature, or with improvable results. For the program stars\nwe have obtained accurate photoelectric or CCD photometry, generally in B and V bands of the Johnson system,\nand high S/N, high resolution (resolving power 20000)\nEchelle+CCD spectroscopy over the whole 4550-9480 \u00c5\nrange. The goal is to provide accurate orbital solutions\nand stellar parameters, analyze the stellar atmospheres\nvia synthetic spectra techniques and derive evolutionary\nstatus and age via comparison with evolutionary stellar\nmodels and tracks.

With this information derived from photometry in hand we begun to\nobtain spectroscopic observations. This paper presents a\ncomplete analysis of the combined photometric and spectroscopic data.\n\n2. The data\n2.1. Photometry\nPhotometric B and V data are those already described\nin detail by Da02b, that used an Optec SSP5 photoelectric photometer housing standard Johnson filters. Here we\naugment the photometric data by an additional set obtained, exactly in the same way, around the secondary\neclipse to investigate the long term photometric stability\nof the system and to check in more detail the reduction\nof intrinsic variability during the secondary eclipse. The\nwhole set of photometric data are available in electronic\nform1 . In all, 1139 points in B and 1574 in V densely map\nthe whole lightcurve, with a r.m.s. accuracy of 5 millimag.\nThe photometric data reported by Da02b were reduced\nusing VJ =8.15, BJ =8.85 from Hipparcos Catalogue for\nthe comparison star HD 36974. They have been now rereduced (and as such used in the paper and listed in the\nweb page) using the Tycho values VT =8.259, BT =9.030\ntransformed to corresponding Johnson values VJ =8.180,\nBJ =8.871 following the Bessell (2000) transformations.\n\n2.2. Spectroscopy\nSpectra of V432 Aur have been secured with the\nEchelle+CCD spectrograph on the 1.82 m telescope operated by Osservatorio Astronomico di Padova atop Mt.\nEkar (Asiago). A 2 arcsec slit was adopted with fixed E-W\norientation, producing a PSF with a FWHM of 1.75 pixels over the whole observing campaign, corresponding to\na resolving power close to 20000. The PSF is measured on\nthe night-sky emission lines. Even if uniformly illuminating the slit, they are considered a fair approximation of\nthe stellar illumination mode of the slit given the typical\nseeing (around 2 arcsec) and the manual guiding of the\nstar on the slit for half an hour each exposure. Analysis\n1\n\nat http://ulisse.pd.astro.it/Binaries/V432 Aur/\n\n\fA.Siviero et al.: Asiago eclipsing binaries program. I. V432 Aur\n\nof isolated telluric absorption lines confirms the value for\nthe resolving power.\nThe detector has been a UV coated Thompson CCD\n1024x1024 pixel, 19 micron square size, covering in one\nexposure from 4500 to 9480 \u00c5 (from Echelle order #49\nto #24). The short wavelength limit is set by a 2 mm\nOG 455 long-pass filter, inserted in the optical train to cut\nthe second order from the cross-disperser. The wavelength\nrange is covered without gaps between adjacent Echelle\norders up to 7300 \u00c5.\nThe exposure time has been 1800 sec for 45 spectra\nin Table 1 and 1200 sec for the remaining 7, which guaranteed an excellent S/N of the recorded spectrum while\nthe orbital phase smearing being completely negligible\n(1800 sec corresponding to 0.67% of the orbital period).\nThe spectra have been extracted and calibrated in a\nstandard fashion with IRAF running under Linux operating system. The wavelength solution has been derived\nsimultaneously for all 26 recorded Echelle orders, with an\naverage r.m.s of 0.18 km sec\u22121 . A pruned Thorium line list\nhas been adopted, where all lines falling into blend at our\n20 000 resolving power or approaching/reaching saturation\nat our 3 sec exposure time have been deleted, leaving an\naverage of 11 lines per order retained in the wavelength\nsolution.\n\n2.3. Radial velocities\nTo derive the radial velocities, we have considered only\nthe six Echelle orders #40\u201345 that cover the 4890\u20135690 \u00c5\nrange, trimming 25% at both ends of each order (thus retaining the central 50% of order). The reasons for this are:\n(a) at these wavelengths the target spectral energy distribution and the instrumental response reach the maximum\nefficiency, (b) the selected spectral range is packed with a\ngreat number of marked and similar intensity FeI lines\nthat assure easy splitting of individual components and a\ngreat cross-correlation performance2 , (c) the trimmed six\nEchelle orders fall right at the center of the spectrograph\nfocal plane and CCD imaging area, where the recorded\ninstrumental PSF is the sharpest, (d) retaining only the\ncentral 50% of each of the six orders avoids degradation\nof wavelength solution accuracy towards the orders' ends\nand so maintains the accuracy of derived radial velocities,\nand (e) due to the Echelle blaze function, the instrument\nresponse at orders edges falls below 40% of the peak value\nat center of each order, thus producing toward order edges\nboth a poorer S/N and a steeper continuum (harder to\n2\n\nIn principle, further redder Echelle orders could have been\nadded in the radial velocity measurements to the aim of improving the accuracy of the results. We have experimented in\nthis direction, and the resulting gain has been marginal and unsufficient to justify the large extra measurement effort. In fact,\nproceeding toward longer wavelengths the number of stellar absorption lines per Echelle order rapidly decreases. Furthermore,\ntelluric absorptions (which adversely affect the accuracy of\ncross-correlation measurements) begin to appear with the next\nredder order, number #39, that covers the range 5650\u20135840 \u00c5.\n\n3\n\nTable 3.

Zeroing radial velocities\nThe Cassegrain-fed Asiago Echelle spectrograph is well\nsuited for measurement of accurate radial velocities, with\na stable and modest flexure pattern modeled by Munari\nand Lattanzi (1991), and null spectrograph velocity (in the\nsense introduced by Petrie 1963, i.e. the systematic difference between the zeros of the stellar and thorium lamp\nwavelength scales as due to different slit illumination and\noptical path). On all spectra of Table 1 we have checked\nand confirmed the null spectrograph velocity using nightsky emission lines (selected from the list by Osterbrock et\nal. 2000). The radial velocities cluster around 0.0 km sec\u22121\nwith a typical 0.4 km sec\u22121 dispersion.\nThe spectrograph flexures can affect the results because of the observing mode, and must be corrected for.\nEach 1800 sec spectrum on the star was followed - after\nthe 3 min required to read the science exposure and to\nprepare for the thorium 3 sec exposure - by the comparison spectrum with the telescope still tracking the star.\nIn such a way, a shift of \u223c18 min in hour angle is introduced between the telescope position at mid-exposure on\nthe star and on the thorium lamp. To account for the flexure pattern and possible off-center guiding of the stellar\nphoto-center on the slit, the rich telluric line spectrum on\nthe reddest orders of the recorded spectra has been crosscorrelated against a template telluric spectrum, following\na technique pioneered by Griffin and Griffin (1973). The\ntemplate telluric spectrum has been obtained with exactly\n\nThe orbital modeling of V432 Aur has been obtained with\nversion WD98K93d4 of the Wilson-Devinney code (Wilson\nand Devinney 1971) as modified by Milone et al. (1992)\nto include Kurucz's model atmospheres to aproximate the\nsurface fluxes of the two stars. The computations have\nbeen run within Mode-2 program option. Input parameters for the first iterations (period and epoch, semi-major\naxis, mass ratio, temperature of the two components, zero\neccentricity, Kopal's surface potential \u03a91 and \u03a92 , bolometric albedos) have been computed by hand from radial\nand light curves and from spectral types of both components. They turned out to be already quite accurate because the final achieved solution converged toward pretty\nsimilar values.

In each panel the lower curves represent (not to scale with the main spectra but in\ncorrect proportion between them) the contribution of each component of the binary to the formation of the observed\nspectrum at the given phase. The markers connect the shifted wavelengths of the same sample MgI (top panels) and\nFeI (bottom panels) lines in the spectra of the two components of the binary.\nponents, they were found negligible and thus dropped from\nfurther modeling. Therefore only the inverse square law\nillumination was considered, and the bolometric albedos\nwere set to 1.0 and tests on the lightcurve confirmed the\nchoice.\nFinally, a gravity brightening exponent \u03b2=1.0 has been\nadopted consistently with the radiative nature of the atmospheres in V432 Aur, and co-rotation of both components has been taken in agreement with evidences from the\natmospheric spectral analysis and stability of spot longitude as discussed below.\nThe resulting orbital modeling and corresponding\nphysical quantities are summarized in Table 3, and the\nmodel radial velocity and light curves are over-plotted to\nobserved values in Figure 1. In the latter no Rossiter effect\nis introduced given the absence of observed radial velocities at the key short phases around primary and secondary\neclipses that could be used to check it.\n\n3.1. A surface bright spot\nAn evident O'Connell effect (O'Connell 1951, Davidge and\nMilone 1984) is present in the V432 Aur light curve centered close to 0.75 orbital phase.

The plotted theoretical Padova evolutionary tracks and isochrones\n(Fagotto et al. 1994, Bertelli et al. 1994, and follow-ups with the latest up-dates available via the web interface to\nthe Padova theoretical group at the address http://pleiadi.pd.astro.it/) have been derived from interpolation of\nadjacent points in the computed grid (1.00\u22121.10 and 1.20\u22121.30 M\u2299 , and \u22120.37 and \u22120.67 for [Z/Z\u2299 ]). The agreement\nis excellent in both position on the tracks (upper left panel) and on the isochrones (upper right panel), the latter\nsupporting a 3.75 Gyr age. The bottom panels show how the theoretical loci move for minimal changes in mass and\nmetallicity, indicating the high sensitivity of the method.\nthe convention for WD98K93 code). The spot is taken\ncircular, with an angular extent of 12\u25e6 as seen from the\ncenter of secondary star, with a 20% increase in Teff with\nrespect to the temperature of surrounding unperturbed\nstellar surface (7300 K). However, different combinations\nof temperature, angular extent and latitude still provide\nacceptable fits to the observed light curve. Our analysis is\nnot aiming to precise values for the spot parameters, but\njust to bring attention to the fact that spot(s) are present\non the surface of the secondary star of V432 Aur.\nThe spot has been present during the entire period\nof our observations, because the lightcurve around 0.75\norbital phase as displayed in Figure 1 comes from observations secured at various epochs, and all individual\nbranches display the same O'Connell effect. In particular,\nthe longitude of the spot appears to have remained con-\n\nstant during the whole observing period, indicating both\nstellar co-rotation and absence of spot migration.\nIt could be argued that the observed O'Connell effect\nis instead due to a dark spot on the other side that reduces\naround orbital phase 0.25 an ellipticity effect of the secondary. We are inclined to discard this possibility because\na dark spot should not produce emission cores in the diagnostic CaII far-red triplet lines and because the orbital\nmodeling above described would hardly converge in such\na scenario.\n\n4.

I. V432 Aur\n\nFig. 4. Rotational velocity of the secondary star in V432 Aur. The thick line is a short wavelength range from spectrum\n#39294 at phase 0.75 (cf. Table 1). The thin lines, similarly to Figure 2, are the added synthetic spectra (with the\nproper intensity ratio and velocity shift) of the secondary and primary component. Parameters of the synthetic spectra\nare the same as in Table 3, except that three different rotational velocities are explored for the secondary: 40, 50 and\n60 km sec\u22121 . It is evident how 40 km sec\u22121 (the co-rotation velocity) provides an under-estimate of the actual rotational\nvelocity.\n\nFig. 6. Plot according to a period of P =0.1678 days of the\nresiduals of the radial velocities from the orbital solution\nfor the intrinsic variable component of V432 Aur (star 2\nin Table 1).\n\nFig. 5. Period search, for the intrinsic variable component\n(star 2 in Table 1), on the residuals of the radial velocities\nfrom the orbital solution (Figure 1 and Table 2). The period (P =0.1678 days) corresponding to the strongest peak\nis arrowed.\ntrum of the primary component. Unfortunately, during the\nscheduled spectroscopic observing runs at the telescope,\nV432 Aur never passed through the primary eclipse, and\ntherefore it has not been possible to obtain the isolated\nspectra of the individual components.\nTo the aim of performing an atmospheric analysis of\nthe two components of V432 Aur we have therefore focused on the spectra of the highest S/N around phases\n0.25 and 0.75 (cf. Table 2), where the velocity separation of the components is maximum and the same lines\n\nfrom the two components are unbleded. Working simultaneously at phase 0.25 and 0.75 allows also to get rid of\nline superposition and strongly reinforces the robustness\nof the overall fit.\nTo derive the basic stellar parameters (Teff , log g,\n[Z/Z\u2299 ] and Vrot ) we have performed a \u03c72 best match analysis of the high S/N observed spectra around phases 0.25\nand 0.75 (spectrum # 39233, 39239, 39605, 39294 and\n39607 in Table 1) against the extensive grid of synthetic\nKurucz's spectra computed by Munari et al. (2003) for\nthe same resolution of the Asiago Echelle spectrograph\n(R=20 000) over the 2 500\u221210 500 \u00c5 range (thus fully\ncovering the wavelength range recorded for V432 Aur).\nThe Munari et al. (2003) synthetic atlas covers the range\n3 500\u2264 Teff \u226447 500, 0.0\u2264 log g \u22645.0, +0.5\u2264 [Z/Z\u2299 ]\n\u2264 \u22122.5 (with solar relative abundances for metals) and\n0\u2264 Vrot \u2264500 km sec\u22121 . The grid steps around the values appropriate to V432 Aur are 250 K in temperature,\n0.5 dex in gravity, 0.5 dex in metallicity and 10 km sec\u22121\nin rotation.\n\n\fA.Siviero et al.: Asiago eclipsing binaries program. I. V432 Aur\n\nTo proceed independently from the orbital solution,\nand thus to use the atmospheric analysis to validate it,\nwe had to first define the region where the true minimum\nof the \u03c72 distribution has to be looked for, to avoid being\ntrapped into unphysical local minima. To accomplish this,\nwe have isolated from the spectrum secured at secondary\neclipse (#39684 in Table 1) the wavelength range 8480\u2013\n8740 \u00c5 (dominated by diagnostic CaII triplet and Paschen\nseries lines). We have classified it against the spectral atlases of Munari and Tomasella (1999) and Marrese et al.\n(2003) obtained over the same wavelength range with the\nsame instrumental set-up for the Asiago Echelle spectrograph. We also checked the consistency of the classification against the synthetic atlas of Munari and Castelli\n(2000) that covers this wavelength region at the same resolving power of our observations. Having determined in\n\u223c6500 K the combined temperature of the two stars, we\nhave moved to the analytical \u03c72 test by fixing to 5500\u2013\n7500 the temperature boundary and to \u2264100 km sec\u22121\nthe rotational velocities and imposing no restriction on\ngravity and metallicity. The analysis has been limited to\nthe same six Echelle orders adopted for the derivation of\nradial velocities (cf. sect. 2.3), ready to include additional\norders if not satisfactorily converging on the first six. This\nhas not been necessary given the close similarity of the\nresults among the 6 selected orders.\nThe results of the atmospheric analysis are given in\nTable 4, where a comparison is provided with the parameters common to the orbital solution. Given the absolute\nindependence of the two methods (carried out independently by two distinct sub-groups of the authors of this\npaper), the remarkable correspondence mutually reinforce\nthe confidence in the orbital solution and atmospheric\nanalysis. Two small and diagnostic samples of the 4860\u2013\n5690 \u00c5 range investigated via \u03c72 test are shown in Figure 2\nto show the match between observed and synthetic spectra. Inspection of the match over the whole range does not\nsupport chemical anomalies, and therefore the metals in\nV432 Aur appear to follow the relative Sun proportions.\nIf chemical anomalies should have emerged, it would have\nbeen required to run a devoted atmospheric analysis (instead of the \u03c72 comparison to a pre-computed grid).\n\n5. Comparison with stellar theoretical models\nThe theoretical models describe the location of stars on\nthe theoretical plane L, Teff , while observations place the\nstars on the observational plane, e.g. V, (B-V). The correspondence between them is all but a straightforward one,\nbeing strongly affected by bolometric correction, colortemperature transformation, distance, reddening, proper\nknowledge of the transmission profile of the photometric\nbands, etc. The orbital solution in Table 2, providing directly L and Teff , overcomes all such difficulties and allow\nan assumption-free comparison between observations and\nmodels.\nAdopting Teff =5770 K and R=6.96 106 km for the\nSun (Allen 1976), the position of the two components of\n\n9\n\nFig. 7. Position on the HR diagram of the \u03b4 Sct component of V432 Aur compared with those given by Breger\n(1979). Position of \u03b4 Sct components of eclipsing binaries are plotted with open circles and identified (from\nBroglia & Marin 1974, Clausen & Nordstr\u00f6m 1980, Griffin\n& Boffin 2003, J\u00f8rgensen & Gr\u00f8nbech 1978, Popper 1973,\nRodr\u0131\u0301guez et al. 1998, Sarma & Abhyankar 1979, Sarma\net al. 1996, Zwitter et al. 2003). The dashed ellipse contours the locus of validated \u03b3 Dor variables according to\nBreger and Beichbuchner (1996) and Kaye et al. (1999).\n\nV432 Aur on the L, Teff plane is presented in Figure 3,\nwhere a comparison is provided with evolutionary tracks\nand isochrones appropriate for the masses (1.22 and 1.08\nM\u2299 ) and metallicity ([Z/Z\u2299 ]=\u22120.6) of the system components. They have been obtained via interpolation over the\ngrid computed by the Padova theoretical group (Fagotto,\net al. 1994, Bertelli et al. 1994, Girardi et al. 2000, and\nreferences therein). Given the high sensibility to mass and\nmetallicity of the evolutionary tracks, as depicted in the\nlower panels of Figure 3, the excellent agreement between\nobservations and theory is an independent check of the\naccuracy of the results obtained with the orbital and atmospheric analysis. The placing of both components exactly halfway between the isochrones for 3.5 and 4.0 Gyr\nsuggests and age of 3.75 Gyr for V432 Aur.\nThe secondary star is well evolved away from the main\nsequence and approaching the base of the giant branch,\nwhile the primary has only marginally moved away from\nthe ZAMS and is still living its main sequence phase.\n\n\f10\n\nA.Siviero et al.: Asiago eclipsing binaries program. I. V432 Aur\n\n6. Synchronous rotation and macro-turbulence\nGiven the long life lived by both components on the main\nsequence, there is little room for doubts that they reached\nat that time perfect synchronization between orbital and\nrotation periods. We can obviously assume that the rotation axes are aligned with the orbital axis (reached earlier\nin the binary evolution according to the time scale discussed by Hut 1981; for deviations from the rule see for ex.\nGlebocki and Stawikowski 1997). Consequently, from the\norbital period and stellar radii in Table 2 it can be derived\nthat the equatorial rotational velocities for synchronous\nrotation at the present time are 20 and 40 km sec\u22121 for\nthe primary and the secondary, respectively. The rotational velocities derived by the atmospheric analysis reported in Table 3 are 20 and 50 km sec\u22121 for the primary and the secondary, respectively. While the match\nis perfect for the primary, no doubt the line profiles for\nthe secondary star show a broadness that if interpreted\nin terms of rotation would indicate the secondary to rotate faster than synchronous rotation, even if a precise\nquantification at 1 km sec\u22121 level requires higher resolution spectra obtained during the totality phase at the\nprimary eclipse. This finding is unexpected, because one\nmay argue that an expanding star tends to rotate slower\nfor obvious arguments based on the conservation of the\nangular momentum, and tidal torque forces can bring the\nstar in synchronous rotation with the orbital motion only\nif their time scale is shorter than the expansion time-scale.\nThe time scale for an expansion of 10% of the radius of\nthe secondary star of V432 Aur is (from the evolutionary\ntracks):\n\u0393(R\u219110%) = 6 107 yr\n(1)\nFollowing Zahn (1977) the synchronization time for stars\nwith convective envelopes can be expressed as function of\nmass-ratio q and period P as:\n\ntsync \u2248 10\n\n4\n\n\u0012\n\n1+q\n2q\n\n\u00132\n\nP4\n\nyr\n\n(2)\n\nor tsync \u223c 8 105 yr in our case, thus 2 orders of magnitude faster than radius expansion. Therefore, the evolved\ncomponent of V432 Aur should currently be locked into\nsynchronicity.\nThe extra broadness of spectral lines of the secondary\nstar is probably not due to rotation but to other reasons, among which a major contributor could be a macroturbulent velocity field in its atmosphere. The net effect\nof macro-turbulence affects mostly the wings of the lines,\nmaking them broader (cf. Grey 1992). Macro-turbulent\nmotions on a scale larger than observed with Sun's photospheric granulation have to be expected in the secondary\nstar of V432 Aur considering that large spots affect its\nsurface (cf. sect. 3.1) and that it is probably pulsating (cf.\nsect 7 below). Macro-turbulent velocities determined by\nDonati et al. (1995) for the active surface RS CVn star\n\n\u03bb Andromedae are \u03b6p =5.5 km sec\u22121 for the photosphere\nand \u03b6p =10 km sec\u22121 for the active surface regions.\nHigher resolution observations (with a resolving power\nnot less than 60 000) during the primary minimum are obviously desirable to better investigate the line profiles of\nthe secondary star. Higher resolution observations are required to reduce the \u00b15 km sec\u22121 error bar on the Vrot sin i\nin Table 4, and to disentangle the pure rotational broadening of the spectral lines from that of other possible broadening sources, in particoular the macro-turbulence.\n\n7. The intrinsic variability of the cooler\ncomponent\nDa02b already noted how the lightcurve of V432 Aur is\naffected by an additional variability superimposed to the\neclipsing one. In fact, the light curves in Figure 1 show a\nnoise much larger than expected for a 5 millimag-mag precision of the individual points. The flat bottom of the primary eclipse shows distinct branches corresponding to different observing epochs, which almost vanish at secondary\neclipse. It is therefore clear that the additional variability\nis associated with the secondary, larger and cooler component.\nOur photometric observations do not cover sufficiently\nlong, uninterrupted runs to allow fruitful period search at\nspecific epochs, and analysis of the whole data set does\nnot provide firm values. The residuals of radial velocities of the secondary from their orbital model fitting in\nFigure 1 are larger than the mean of individual errors (cf.\nlast column of Table 2), which suggests the presence of a\npossible pulsation activity. The residuals have been analyzed with a Deeming-Fourier code (Deeming 1975) and\nthe resulting power spectrum is presented in Figure 5.\nSeveral peaks are present, with Figure 6 plotting in phase\nthe residuals of radial velocities according to the strongest\npeak at 0.1678 day. A pulsation amplitude of the order\nof 1.5 km sec\u22121 seems present. A similar pulsation amplitude is shown by the multi-epoch radial velocities of\nthe \u03b4 Sct variable within the GK Dra eclipsing system\n(Dallaporta et al. 2002a, Griffin and Boffin 2003). To estimate the reliability of the 0.1678 day period, we have randomly removed 15% of the radial velocity residuals and\nperformed again the Deeming-Fourier analysis. We have\nrepeated the procedure 50 times, and 0.1678 day has remained the strongest peak in the power spectrum in 4/5\nof the trials. Even if we cannot claim for sure that this is\na true periodicity for V432 Aur, nevertheless it seems the\nbest one with the available data.\nThe amplitude of the photometric variability is \u2206V \u2248\n0.075 mag and the spectral classification of the intrinsic\nvariable component is F9 IV. According to the review by\nFeast (1996), the \u03b4 Sct variables have periods shorter than\n0.3 days, their spectral types go from A to F, and the amplitudes span from a few millimag-mag up to 0.8 mag with\na mean around 0.2 mag. The \u03b4 Sct variables may be both\nradial or non-radial pulsators, or even display a combination of the two modes, which superposition causes a beat-\n\n\fA.Siviero et al.: Asiago eclipsing binaries program. I. V432 Aur\n\ning that makes the lightcurve to appear frequently chaotic.\nThe shape and amplitude of the light and radial velocity curves change continuously, as nicely documented by\nBreger (1977). Therefore, phase over-plotting of data from\na range of different epochs frequently results in a wash-out\nof the pulsation shape of the curve, which appears disappointingly too noisy. Figure 7 compares the position, on a\ncolor-absolute magnitude diagram, of the secondary star\nin V432 Aur and of known \u03b4 Sct stars, highlighting in particular the position of those contained in eclipsing binary\nsystems. The locus for the \u03b3 Dor pulsating variables, frequently discussed in connection to the \u03b4 Sct ones, is also\nmarked. The secondary star in V432 Aur falls away from\nboth types of variables, so any association with them is\nat the moment only tentative. It is worth to note that Xu\net al. (2002) have speculated that a low metallicity should\npush the locus of \u03b4 Sct variables on such diagram toward\nthe position occupied by V432 Aur, which is characterized\nby [Fe/H]=\u22120.6 as above derived.\nAs already stated, our photometric observations are\nscattered through many nights, and no single observing\nrun is densely populated and is long enough to allow to\ninvestigate pulsation light curves at any individual epoch.\nA long series of consecutive observations does not exist\neither for the radial velocities. Firmly establishing if one\nor more periods are contemporaneously excited and determining their precise values (and the shape of corresponding light or radial velocity curves) is mandatory to ascertain the nature of the intrinsic variability in V432 Aur.\nTo this aim we plan for the coming new observing season to obtain night-long consecutive series of photometric\n(optical and possibly infrared too) and radial velocity observations of V432 Aur.\nAcknowledgements.
