INTRODUCTION\n\nGravitationally bound stellar clusters are the only\nknown class of systems that, to the limit of our precision, generally consist of stars of the same age (for some\nnotable exceptions see Villanova et al. 2007; Piotto et al.\n2007; Mackey et al. 2008). As such they play a central\nrole in the development of our understanding of stellar\nevolution (cf. Sandage 1953) and of the dynamical evolution of stellar systems (cf. King 1966). However, there is\none significant shortcoming of the sample of Milky Way\nclusters as a testbed of models - they are almost exclusively old. While arguments continue regarding the\nexact spread in the ages of Milky Way globular clusters,\nthe consensus is that they are mostly older than 10 Gyr\n(Salaris & Weiss 2002). Fortunately, the stellar clusters\nin other local galaxies do not suffer the same cluster senility.\nFor rich and young clusters in the Local Group, there\nexist age estimates based on the analysis of stellar\ncolor-magnitude diagrams (Pietrzynski & Udalski 1999;\nMackey & Gilmore 2004; Glatt, Grebel, & Koch 2010).\nHowever, the sample of clusters with such measurements\nand corresponding size, mass and other structural measurements is modest in comparison to the total number of nearby clusters. The Magellanic Clouds alone\ncontain several thousand clusters. There are two complementary approaches to the study of these clusters.\nOne can construct a high-quality, high-resolution sample of observations, usually using space-based data, of a\nlimited number of clusters (Mackey & Gilmore 2003a,b;\nGlatt et al. 2009). These data produce the highest fidelity measurements of the structural parameters and\nages. Alternatively, one can measure these parameters\nmore crudely, usually using ground-based data, but for\na significantly larger sample of clusters. Because of our\ninvolvement in the Magellanic Clouds Photometric Survey (Zaritsky et al. 1997, 2002, 2004), we have adopted\nthe second approach. We have previously presented catfwerchan@email.arizona.edu,dzaritsky@as.arizona.edu\n\nalogs of stellar clusters in the Small Magellanic Cloud\nthat quantified the structure (Hill & Zaritsky 2006) and\nage (Rafelski & Zaritsky 2005) for \u223c 200 clusters. Here\nwe present the analogous catalog of structural properties for 1066 clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud and\ncompare those to the structural properties of the cluster\npopulations of the SMC. We adopt an LMC distance of\n50 kpc when converting to physical units. We briefly review the data and model fitting procedure in \u00a72 and 3,\nand discuss clusters properties in \u00a74.\n2. DATA AND CLUSTER CATALOG\n\nThe original U , B, V , and I band images, from which\nthe photometric stellar catalog was constructed, come\nfrom drift scans obtained with the Great Circle Camera\n(Zaritsky et al. 1996) mounted on the Swope 1m telescope at the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile for the\nMagellanic Clouds Photometric Survey (Zaritsky et al.\n1997). In summary, these images have a pixel scale of 0.7\narcsec pixel\u22121 , exposure times ranging from about 4 to\n5 minutes, and typical seeing of 1.5 arcsec. We obtained\nthese data primarily to recover the star formation history\nof the Magellanic Clouds and that work is described by\nHarris & Zaritsky (2004, 2009). To detect the candidate\nclusters presented here, we use the LMC photometric catalog (Zaritsky et al. 2004) and search for overdensities\nin that stellar distribution, as we did when studying the\nclusters of the Small Magellanic Cloud (Hill & Zaritsky\n2006) and a portion of the LMC (Zaritsky et al. 1997).\nTo search for clusters, we first bin the stellar density,\nfor stars with V < 20.5, in units of 10 arcsec pixels. Then, we produce a smoothed version of the stellar density on the sky using a median filter ten pixels\nacross. By subtracting the latter from the former, localized concentrations are highlighted. We use SExtractor\n(Bertin & Arnouts 1996) to identify objects, requiring 5\ncontiguous pixels that are above a 7\u03c3 local threshold.\nWe compile a list of 1225 candidate clusters. This list\nis certainly neither complete, nor devoid of false detections. Our aim is to err on the side of caution, so we\n\n\f2\n\nWerchan & Zaritsky\n\nFig. 1.- V -band image mosaic of the first 25 LMC clusters in Table 1. Each image is the central subsection of the image used to fit the\nprofiles shown in Figure 3 and spans 175 arcsec. Mosaics presenting all of the clusters in the sample are available on-line.\n\nvisually examine all candidates and exclude those that\nare either visually non-distinct or strongly contaminated\nby nearby sources (bright stars or nebulosity). Even in\ncases where these rejected candidates represent real clusters we would be unable to obtain reliable structural fits.\nWe retain 1066 clusters and their coordinates and crossidentifications to the Bica et al. (2008) catalog are presented in Table 1, while their images are presented in\nFigure 1. The Bica et al. (2008) catalog is an update of\ntheir earlier work in which they complement their collection of data from the literature with visual examination\nof photographic survey plates. As such, it is an extensive summary of the available data, but somewhat heterogeneous despite best efforts. That catalog includes\nall manner of extended objects, whereas we focus on\nstellar clusters and associations. Major and minor axis\nlengths are included, but profiles are not fit. The catalog cross-identification is done matching to the nearest\n\nsource within 10 arcsec. Out of our total of 1066 clusters, we find matching designations in the literature for\n682 (64%).\nOur sample, like all samples, must be used with caution in evolutionary studies because clusters of particular\nages, masses, and/or surface brightnesses may be preferentially missing. Differences in assumptions regarding\nthis incompleteness have led to apparently conflicting results in the literature (Chandar et al. 2006; Gieles et al.\n2007; de Grijs & Goodwin 2008), but correcting for the\nincompleteness is, as always, model dependent. Because\nthe source photometric catalog is published, it is possible for subsequent investigators to recover the selection\nfunction by placing artificial clusters into the catalog and\nrepeating the cluster selection. We do not attempt to correct our statistics here because the selection function depends on assumptions regarding the parent population,\nand as such this work should be done by the individuals\n\n\fStructural Parameters of LMC Clusters\n\n3\n\nTABLE 1\nCluster Designation and Position\nCluster\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n\u03b1\n\nAlternate Designations\n\n\u03b4\n\n04h\n\n32m\n\n38.64s\n\n\u221272\u25e6\n\n20\u2032\n\n24.57\u2032\u2032\n\n04h\n04h\n06h\n04h\n04h\n04h\n04h\n05h\n05h\n\n41m\n46m\n01m\n45m\n59m\n58m\n49m\n34m\n09m\n\n34.16s\n47.36s\n52.94s\n54.31s\n56.99s\n53.43s\n40.65s\n57.89s\n00.94s\n\n\u221272\u25e6\n\u221272\u25e6\n\u221272\u25e6\n\u221272\u25e6\n\u221272\u25e6\n\u221272\u25e6\n\u221272\u25e6\n\u221272\u25e6\n\u221272\u25e6\n\n23\u2032\n23\u2032\n21\u2032\n21\u2032\n27\u2032\n22\u2032\n14\u2032\n22\u2032\n21\u2032\n\n26.61\u2032\u2032\n38.31\u2032\u2032\n16.72\u2032\u2032\n07.30\u2032\u2032\n10.67\u2032\u2032\n38.82\u2032\u2032\n49.70\u2032\u2032\n55.62\u2032\u2032\n41.80\u2032\u2032\n\nSL4,LW4,KMHK7\nLW27,KMHK39\nSL37,LW61,KMHK98\nSL826,LW363,KMHK1606\nLW56e,KMHK83e\n***\nSL157,LW109,KMHK398\nLW69,KMHK137\nLW247,KMHK1121\nSL272,KMHK601\n\nNote. - The complete version of this Table is presented in the electronic\nedition of the Journal.

We identify the center using the\nstellar overdensity as calculated from the photometric\ncatalog. However, because the catalog is grossly incomplete toward the overcrowded cluster centers, the centers calculated from the catalog often do not correspond\nprecisely to the correct location, where the correct location is defined from visual inspection. Instead, we return to the images themselves and recenter by calculating the luminosity weighted centroid within 20\u2032\u2032 of the\ninitial estimated centroid. We reject the rare, brightest pixels (those that exceed the image mode by 3000\nor more counts) from this calculation. We iterate the\nprocedure seven times, each time using the new center\nto define the aperture. Because even this process can\nsometimes be corrupted, we visually examine all candidate clusters and interactively adjust those centers that\nare evidently incorrect. The cluster images presented in\nFigure 1 are centered on our final adopted centers, so\nthe reader can judge the fidelity of our centering process. For the poorer, irregular clusters the center is often\nill-defined.\nThe second step in determining the cluster surface\nbrightness profiles is the accurate determination of the\nbackground flux. This step is particularly problematic\nin areas of high stellar density or nebulosity. We initially\ncalculate the background as the median within a 60 pixel\nwide (42 arcsec) annulus starting 180 pixels (126 arcsec)\nfrom the cluster center, which is larger than the tidal radius of all of our clusters. Because we do not know the\ncluster size prior to this procedure, and therefore whether\nwe have defined an optimal background aperture, we iterate on the background determination, defining the beginning of the background annulus using the previous\nestimate of the tidal radius. The accurate determination of the background is a key step because adopting a\nbackground level that is \u00b110% off from the correct background often results in a poor fit (Hill & Zaritsky 2006).\nWe fit the combination of model profile and background to the V -band luminosity profile as measured using circular apertures directly on the cluster images. Of\nthe four bands available, V is the deepest and typically\nhas the best image quality. Although individual cluster\n\nstars are often highly confused in the clusters centers,\nthe centers are far from saturated and so the luminosity\ndensity is a fair tracer of the stellar density (barring nonuniformity in the stellar radial mass function). We search\nfor the best fit by examining models over a range of concentrations, 0.001 \u2264 c \u2264 2, central surface brightness\nthat range from 0.25 to 1.75 the mean central (4 arcsec)\nsurface brightness, and core radii that range from 1 to\n101 arcsec. Uncertainties in each parameter, presented\nas the high and low estimates in Tables 2 and 3, are estimated by tracking all models that cannot be rejected\nwith greater than 67% confidence. If even the best fit\nmodel is one that can be rejected with such confidence,\nthen parameter uncertainties are not given.\nFor consistency with our previous work, the functional forms used to model the profiles are the King\n(1962) and EFF (Elson et al. 1987) profiles, as used\nby Hill & Zaritsky (2006). McLaughin & van der Marel\n(2005) made the case in favor of a third functional form,\nthe Wilson (1975) profile. In general, we find that both\nthe King and EFF profiles provide acceptable fits to our\ncandidate clusters because the differences between the\nmodel profiles lie primarily at large radii, where our S/N\nis poor and background uncertainties dominate. We expect the same to be true if we were to compare to the\nWilson profile. Detailed comparisons between profiles\nfor particular clusters should be done with deeper, higher\nresolution data, such as that from the Hubble Space Telescope (McLaughin & van der Marel 2005) and we confine ourselves to a rough, statistical comparison of the\nKing and EFF profiles.\nThe tidal radius, the radius at which stars become unbound to the cluster and in practice where the projected\ndensity drops to zero, is the structural parameter that is\nmost sensitive to the adopted background level. We find\nthat our uncertainty in the background often results in\na tidal radius whose uncertainty is so large as to make\nthe measurement practically meaningless. Instead, we\nchoose to present a more robust measure of the size of\nthe cluster, the radius that includes 90% of the light,\nr90 , calculated from the fitted model profile. In addition\nto the iterative calculation, we visually examine all the\nbackground determinations to determine if the fit may\nhave been contaminated and manually adjust as necessary. In Figure 2 we present the background fits. The\nFigure and Table 2 present the final adopted background\n\n\f4\n\nWerchan & Zaritsky\n\nFig. 2.- Background fits for the first 25 LMC clusters. The range of the horizontal axis is 0\u2032\u2032 to 200\u2032\u2032 for all clusters. The range of the\nvertical axis is \u00b120% of the cluster's background value, and so is different for each cluster. The solid line marks the adopted background\nvalue, which is usually the median within the background annulus described in the text. The short and long dashed lines denote \u00b11% and\n\u00b110% of the central surface brightness.

The most likely source of error in the determination of the profiles for most clusters is in the determination of the background level. The Figure enables the\nreader to examine the definition of the background for\neach cluster.\nOf the 1066 clusters in our final catalog, 269 (\u223c 25%)\nare discrepant with the King profile at 67% confidence,\nwhich is in accordance with the expectation due to random fluctuations and we conclude that the bulk of the\nsample is well described by King models given the available data. The reduced chi-squared values, \u03c72\u03bd , for\nthe King models are somewhat lower than those for\nthe EFF, suggesting, as was the case for SMC clusters\n(Hill & Zaritsky 2006), that the King models provide a\nbetter basis set for the general cluster sample. Of course,\nspecific subsamples, for example younger clusters, may\n\nbe better fit by the EFF models (as originally proposed\nby Elson et al. 1987).\nIn summary, we provide the cluster coordinates and\ncross-identifications in Table 1, the best fit parameters\nin Table 2, the sky region and fits in Figure 2, the luminosity profiles plus background and fits in Figure 3, and\nthe sky-subtracted profiles in Figure 4. In Table 2 we\npresent, in matching order to the listing in Table 1, the\nlow, best, and high estimates of the core radii in pc (1 \u03c3\nuncertainties), the low, best, and high estimates of the\n90% enclosed radii in pc, the integrated V magnitude\nbased on the model fits, the central surface brightness\nin counts/sq. arcsec as measured from the models, the\nbackground value in counts/sq. arcsec, and the value of\n\u03c72\u03bd . We examine the profile plots for all of the clusters to\ndetermine if any needed to be refit with slightly different\n\n\fStructural Parameters of LMC Clusters\n\n5\n\nFig. 3.- V -band surface brightness profiles of the first 25 LMC clusters and King model plus background fits. The range of the horizontal\naxis is 0\u2032\u2032 to 200\u2032\u2032 for all clusters, while the vertical axis is set for each cluster. All cluster profiles are available on-line.\n\ncenter or sky values. We refit roughly 40% with slight\nchanges in centroid or background value, but usually the\ndifferences in the fit parameters are negligible.\nIn Figure 5 we show the V -band images of the 20 clusters with the highest \u03c72\u03bd values. This Figure demonstrates that poorly fitting clusters are not necessarily\nextremely poor or marginal clusters. On occasion they\nhave a neighboring cluster that affects the fit, but in\nmost cases the appear normal. This suggests that the\nhigh \u03c72\u03bd reflects a more basic problem with the fitting\nprofile rather than with the data themselves. However,\nit is also true that in such a large sample, one naturally\nexpects some outliers, particularly because our statistical errors do not include for the possibility background\nfluctuations.\nWe test our EFF-model fit parameters against\nthose derived using superior data presented by\nMackey & Gilmore (2003b). They do not present r90\nfor their clusters and we do not trust our estimates of\n\nthe tidal radii, so the one radius we can compare between the two studies is the core radius, rc . There are\n16 clusters in common with the necessary data between\nthe two studies and the comparison is presented in Figure 6. The agreement is generally good, although there\nmay be an indication for a slight systematic bias in the\nsense that we would be overestimating rc . Such a bias\nwould not be surprising given the superior resolution of\nthe HST data, although if we consider only those clusters for which our fits cannot be rejected with > 90%\nconfidence (those with x axis error bars) we find weaker\nevidence for any systematic difference between the two\nstudies.\n4.

Nevertheless, the differences can be rather subtle (see Figure 4)\nand one question is whether the choice of model greatly\n\nFig. 8.- Comparison of r90 values for King and EFF model fits.\nThe solid line is the 1:1 line.\n\nFig. 9.- Comparision of rc values for King and EFF model fits.\nThe solid line is the 1:1 line.\n\naffects the derived parameters one might want to use to\nquantify cluster structure, such as the core radius or size.\nIn Figure 8, we compare the r90 values for the King and\nEFF models and find that the EFF r90 tends to have a\nlarger r90 value than King. For the smaller clusters the\ndifferences appear modest (\u223c 25%) but the values are\ncorrelated. However, for the larger clusters (r90 > 30\narcsec) the correlation breaks down and the difference\ncan amount to factors of several. This differences arises\nfrom the extrapolation of the profile to radii larger than\nthose for which our data provide good constraints and the\nimplication of significant amounts of light at large radius,\nwhich of course drives r90 upwards. Due to the truncated\nnature of King profiles, we prefer those in determining r90\nbecause there is less potential for those profiles to \"run\naway\" at large radii.

Ring Clusters\nIn the SMC, Hill & Zaritsky (2006) had noted a small,\nbut interesting sub-class of clusters that appear ring-like.\nWe find similar clusters in the LMC and show such clusters in Figure 10. From our visual inspection of the profiles (Figure 3, we classify 78 as ring clusters (\u223c 7% of\nour sample). The nature of these clusters remains a mystery that detailed kinematics might help resolve. We plot\ntheir projected distribution, as well as all other clusters,\nin the LMC in Figure 11 but find no telltale difference in\nthe distribution of the ring clusters.\n4.3. Comparison to the Cluster Population of the Small\n\nMagellanic Cloud\nWe compare the profile structural parameters, more\nspecifically r90 , core radius and cluster concentration,\nfor our LMC and the published SMC cluster populations\n(Hill & Zaritsky 2006). In Figure 12 we compare the r90\nvalues. We find that the distributions are very similar\nfor r90 < 15 pc, but that there is a significant drop in\nthe fraction of clusters with r90 > 15 pc in the LMC relative to the SMC. The tail of large clusters extends in\nthe SMC, even though the SMC has one-fifth the total\nnumber of clusters. We confirm this visual impression\nusing a KS test to calculate that the likelihood of these\ntwo populations being drawn from the same parent distribution is 9 \u00d7 10\u22125 . Similarly, Bica et al. (2008) find\nthat the size distribution of associations, in particular,\nare more populated at large sizes in the SMC than in the\nLMC (see their Figure 4).\nThere is the potential that this result is related to an\nunknown selection bias rather than to a physical effect.\nBecause the systems are found in the SMC and not in\nthe LMC, a likely suspect is the higher stellar density\nfound in the LMC. Over the bulk of the survey area, the\nstellar densities are not grossly different between the two\ngalaxies, but the bar region of the LMC greatly exceeds\n\nFig. 11.- The distribution of all the LMC clusters according\nto their RA and DEC measurements.

If these larger systems tend\nto be found near the centers of galaxies then we may\nhave preferentially missed them in the LMC. However,\nin the SMC they are found throughout our survey region with a preference for the lower density, SMC wing.\nOur LMC survey extends to low surface density regions,\nwhere we would expect to have detected such systems.\nFurthermore, the Bica et al. (2008) compilation extends\neven further in radius around the LMC and should have\nalso found these systems.\nWe follow-up on this finding by comparing the distributions of rc . Again, we find that the bulk of the\npopulations look quite similar, but that the SMC has a\nmore significant tail of objects with large values, despite\n\n\f10\n\nWerchan & Zaritsky\nSMC due to lower tidal stresses.

Again,\na KS test confirms the visual impression and the corresponding likelihood for the null hypothesis is 2 \u00d7 10\u22128 .\nInterestingly, the distribution of concentrations (Figure\n14) are much more similar between the two cluster populations and they are not distinguishable at a > 3\u03c3 level.\nWe conclude that this population of clusters is larger in\noverall scale, not just outer envelope. We speculate that\nsuch clusters formed and/or survived preferentially in the\n\nWe present a catalog of structural parameters for 1066\nstellar clusters in the Large Magellanic Clouds. By construction, the catalog is of the same format as that published for the population of clusters in the Small Magellan\nCloud (Hill & Zaritsky 2006). Images, profiles, and the\ncalculated parameters are presented for all clusters. As\ndone for the SMC clusters, we intend to estimate ages\nfor these clusters in subsequent work to search for evolutionary signatures.\nWe find that King (1966) and Elson et al. (1987) profile fits, are statistically good fits for the bulk of the sample and that our parameters are in good agreement with\nexisting data that is superior in quality but far more limited in quantity (Mackey & Gilmore 2003b). One subset\nof clusters for which the fits fail are clusters that are underdense in their geometric centers, which we refer to\nas \"ring\" clusters and which we also found in the SMC\n(Hill & Zaritsky 2006).\nWe find that the LMC cluster populations lacks a subpopulation of large clusters seen in the SMC. We find\nthe lack of such clusters when comparing values of either\nr90 (the radius that encloses 90% of the luminosity) or\nrc (the King model core radius). In both cases, the likelihoods that the distributions are drawn from the same\nparent sample are < 10\u22124 . We speculate that the differences may be the result of a lower tidal field in the\nSMC, although cluster masses are needed to pursue this\nhypothesis further.\n\n\fStructural Parameters of LMC Clusters\n\n11\n\nREFERENCES\nBica, E., Bonatto, C., Dutra, C., & Santos, J., 2008, MNRAS,\n414-430, 131\nBertin, E., & Arnouts, S. 1996, A&A, 117, 393\nChandar, R., Fall, M.S., & Whitmore, B.C. 2006, ApJ, 650, 111L\nElson, R.A.W., Fall, S.M, & Freeman, K.C. 1987, ApJ, 323, 54\nde Grijs, R., & Goodwin, S.P. 2008, MNRAS, 383, 1000\nGieles, M., Lamers, H.J.G.L.M., & Portegies Zwart, S.F. 2007,\nApJ, 668, 268\nGlatt, K., et al. 2009, AJ, 138 1403\nGlatt, K., Grebel, E.K., & Kock, A. 2010, A&A, 517, 50\nHarris, J., & Zaritsky, D. 2004, AJ, 127, 1531\nHarris, J., & Zaritsky, D. 2009, AJ, 138, 1243\nHill, A., & Zaritsky, D. 2006, AJ, 131, 414\nKing, I.R. 1962, AJ, 67, 471\nKing, I.R. 1966, AJ, 71, 64\nMackey, A.D., Broby Nielse, P., Ferguson, A.M.N., & Richardson,\nJ.C. 2008, ApJ, 681, L17\nMackey, A.D. & Gilmore, G.F. 2003, MNRAS, 338, 85\nMackey, A.D. & Gilmore, G.F. 2003, MNRAS, 338, 120\n\nMackey, A.D. & Gilmore, G.F. 2004, MNRAS, 352, 153\nMcLaughlin, D.E., & van der Marel, R.P. 2005, ApJS, 161, 304\nPietrzynski, G. & Udalski, A 1999, Acta Astronomica, 49, 157\nPiotto, G. et al. 2007, ApJ, 661, L53\nRafelski, M., & Zaritsky, D. 2005, AJ, 129, 2701\nSalaris, M. & Weiss, A. 2002, A&A, 388, 492\nSandage, A. 1953, ApJ, 58, 61\nVillanova, S., et al. 2007, ApJ, 663, 296\nWilson, C.P. 1975, AJ, 80, 175\nZaritsky, D., Harris, J., & Thompson, I. 1997, AJ, 114, 1002\nZaritsky, D., Harris, J., Thompson, I.B., Grebel, E.K., & Massey,\nP. 2002, AJ, 123, 855\nZaritsky, D., Harris, J., Thompson, I.B., & Grebel, E.K. 2004,\nAJ, 128, 1606\nZaritsky, D., Shectman, S.A., & Bredthauer, G. 1996, PASP, 108,\n104\n\n\f"}
