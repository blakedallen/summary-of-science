However, in Lorentz-noninvariant systems the number of NG-bosons can be less than N . In this\ncase, the counting of NG-bosons is regulated by the Nielsen\u2013Chadha (NC) theorem [3]: Let n1 and n2 be the numbers\nof gapless excitations that in the limit of long wavelengths have the dispersion laws E \u223c |~\np| and E \u223c |~\np|2 , respectively,\nthen N \u2264 n1 + 2n2 . (Here, E is the energy and p~ is the three-momentum of the particle.) In particular, this theorem\nis valid for relativistically covariant theories as well, since in this case: i) the total number of NG-bosons equals N ,\nthe number of broken symmetry generators [2]; ii) evidently, the dispersion law for these N massless excitations looks\nlike E \u223c |~\np|, thus N = n1 .\nRecently, in some relativistic models describing the dynamics of the kaon condensate in the color-flavor-locked phase\nof dense quark matter, an abnormal number of NG-bosons has been revealed [4, 5]. Since the Lorentz invariance is\nbroken in this case and some of the gapless excitations have a quadratic dispersion law, there are no contradictions\nwith neither Goldstone nor NC theorems. The superfluid 3 He in the A-phase [6] and ferromagnets [7, 8] are other\nknown examples of condensed-matter systems with an abnormal number of NG-bosons.\nIn the present paper, we demonstrate the abnormal number of NG-bosons in the dense color superconducting phase\n(2SC) of quark matter for a simple version of the Nambu\u2013Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model with two light quarks and a\nsingle (quark number) chemical potential. In this phase, which can be realized naturally only at sufficiently large\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress:\naddress:\n\u2021 Electronic address:\n\u00a7 Electronic address:\n\u2020 Electronic\n\ndavid.blaschke@physik.uni-rostock.de\ndebert@physik.hu-berlin.de\nkklim@mx.ihep.su\nyudichev@thsun1.jinr.ru\n\n\f2\nvalues of the chemical potential (300 MeV\u2264 \u03bc <1 GeV) , the initial color SUc (3) symmetry is spontaneously broken\ndown to the SUc (2) group. Hence, in accordance with the usual counting of the Goldstone theorem, one might expect\nfive NG-bosons, corresponding to the five broken symmetry generators, to appear in the NJL model. We shall prove\nthat in the 2SC phase only three gapless excitations that can be identified with NG-bosons appear. Two of them\nhave a quadratic dispersion law, thus yielding no contradiction with the NC theorem. For further applications, notice\nalso the following important criterion which is sufficient for the equality between the number of NG-bosons and the\nnumber of broken generators [5]: If Qi , i = 1, ..., N is the full set of broken generators and if h[Qi , Qj ]i = 0 for any\npair (i, j), then the number of NG-bosons is equal to the number N of broken generators.\nRecall, that there is an alternative approach to study color superconductivity, which is based on the weak coupling perturbative QCD [9]. In this case, using the Schwinger-Dyson equation with one gluon exchange, the color\nsuperconducting phase was proved to exist at asymptotically high densities. In the two-flavored QCD investigations\nof color superconductivity five scalar NG-bosons are shown to exist, which are mixing with gluons and required as\nlongitudinal components for five massive gluons (color Meissner effect) [10]. Hence, the results concerning the number\nof NG-bosons of both the QCD and the NJL model approaches seem to be in contradiction1 . The origin of the above\ndiscrepancy is related to the fact that the ground state of the considered simple NJL\u2013type model is not color-neutral.\nIndeed, since the expectation value of the color charge operator Q8 is non-vanishing, hQ8 i 6= 0, the criterion [5] is\nnot applicable, and an abnormal number of NG-bosons must arise. On the other hand, in quark models with a\ncolor-neutral ground state, according to the above criterion, there should arise a normal number of five NG-bosons\nall having normal (linear) dispersion laws. Most interestingly, we find from the analysis of the mass spectrum in\nour model that the masses of two scalar diquarks are proportional to the ground state expectation value of the color\ncharge hQ8 i. Thus, when color neutrality, i. e. hQ8 i = 0, is imposed in NJL\u2013type models as an additional condition\n(which can be realized by introducing a color-chemical potential, \u03bc8 , \"by hand\" [11]), then two additional massless\nparticles should appear, and the total number of NG-bosons would be equal to five. Recently, it was shown that the\nground state of the 2SC phase of QCD is automatically color-neutral [12] due to a dynamical generation of the color\nchemical potential \u03bc8 by gluon condensation. So, we see that the original discrepancy in the number of NG-bosons\nbetween the QCD approach and an extended NJL approach would disappear.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section II we investigate the considered NJL\u2013type model in the framework of\nthe Nambu\u2013Gor'kov formalism and derive an effective meson\u2013diquark action for a finite chemical potential. Moreover,\nthe gap equations for the quark and diquark condensates are numerically studied. Sections III and IV contain a detailed\nanalysis of the massless and massive excitations in the diquark sectors and explicitly show the influence of the color\nproperties of the ground state on the diquark mass spectrum. Section V contains a summary and discussions. Finally,\ndispersion laws for gapless diquarks are derived in Appendix.\nII.\n\nTHE MODEL AND ITS EFFECTIVE ACTION\n\nIt is well known that perturbative methods are not applicable in the low-energy/density QCD regions. Instead,\neffective field theories are usually considered. The most popular effective theories are based on Lagrangians with\nfour-fermion interactions, like the NJL-type models. Let us first give several (very approximate) arguments somehow\njustifying the chosen structure of our QCD-motivated NJL model introduced below. For this aim, consider two-flavor\nQCD with a nonzero chemical potential and the color group SUc (3). By integrating in the generating functional of\nQCD over gluons and further \"approximating\" the nonperturbative gluon propagator by a \u03b4\u2212function, one arrives\nat an effective local chiral four-quark interaction of the NJL type describing low-energy hadron physics. Finally, by\nperforming a Fierz transformation of the interaction term and taking into account only scalar and pseudo-scalar (q\u0304q)as well as scalar (qq)-interaction channels, one obtains a four-fermionic model given by the following Lagrangian (in\nMinkowski space-time notation)2\nL = q\u0304[\u03b3 \u03bd i\u2202\u03bd + \u03bc\u03b3 0 \u2212 mo ]q + G1 [(q\u0304q)2 + (q\u0304i\u03b3 5~\u03c4 q)2 ] + G2 [q\u0304 C \u01eb\u03b4 \u03b3 5 \u03c4 2 q][q\u0304\u01eb\u03b4 \u03b3 5 \u03c4 2 q C ].\n\n(1)\n\nIn (1), \u03bc \u2265 0 is the quark chemical potential, which in isotopically symmetric quark matter is the same for both\nquark flavors, q C = C q\u0304 t , q\u0304 C = q t C are charge-conjugated spinors, and C = i\u03b3 2 \u03b3 0 is the charge conjugation matrix\n(the symbol t denotes the transposition operation). The quark field q \u2261 qi\u03b1 is a flavor doublet and color triplet as\nwell as a four-component Dirac spinor, where i = 1, 2; \u03b1 = 1, 2, 3. (Latin and Greek indices refer to flavor and color\nindices, respectively; spinor indices are omitted.) Furthermore, we use the notations ~\u03c4 \u2261 (\u03c4 1 , \u03c4 2 , \u03c4 3 ) for Pauli matrices\nin flavor space; (\u01eb\u03b4 )\u03b1\u03b2 \u2261 \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b4 is the totally antisymmetric tensor in color space, respectively. Clearly, Lagrangian\n\n1\n\n2\n\nOf course, it is necessary to point out that the QCD weak coupling considerations are valid at asymptotic values of the chemical\npotential, i. e. at \u03bc > 1 GeV, whereas NJL model results are correct for sufficiently lower values \u03bc < 1 GeV. Thus, a direct comparison\nof results seems to be problematic.\nThe most general Fierz transformed four-fermion interaction includes additional vector and axial-vector (q\u0304q) as well as pseudo-scalar,\nvector and axial-vector-like (qq)-interactions. However, these terms are omitted here for simplicity.\n\n\f3\n(1) is invariant under the chiral SU (2)L \u00d7 SU (2)R (at mo = 0) and color SUc (3) symmetry groups. The physics of\nlight mesons [13, 14, 15, 16], diquarks [17, 18] and meson-baryon interactions [19, 20] was successfully described in\nthe framework of different NJL models. These effective theories were involved for the investigation of both ordinary\n[21, 22, 23], hot and dilute [15], and color superconducting dense quark matter [24, 25, 26, 27]. Usually, on the basis\nof light-meson and baryon phenomenology, the following restrictions on the coupling constants are considered\nG1 > \u03c0 2 /(6\u039b2 ),\n\nG2 < G1 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u039b is the cutoff parameter in the three-dimensional momentum space, necessary to eliminate the ultraviolet\ndivergences appearing when quantum effects (loops) are taken into account (usually \u039b < 1 GeV). Since (1) is a\nlow-energy effective theory for QCD, the external parameter \u03bc is restricted from the above: \u03bc < \u039b. In the region of\ncoupling constants (2) and at small values of \u03bc (the case of low baryon densities), only the operator q\u0304q has a nonzero\nvacuum expectation value. Thus, the chiral symmetry of the model is spontaneously broken in this case, while SUc (3)\nremains intact. The behavior of quark and meson masses is established rather well in quark matter of low density\n[21, 22]. In particular, the number of \u03c0-mesons, which are the three NG-bosons in this phase, is equal to the number of\nbroken symmetry generators. Hence, this example is a good demonstration of the fact that Lorentz noninvariance is a\nnecessary but not sufficient condition for the abnormal number of NG-bosons to appear in the system. At sufficiently\nhigh values of the chemical potential \u03bc \u223c 300 \u00f7 350 MeV, the two-flavor color superconductivity phase occurs in model\n(1) [26]. So, a nonzero diquark condensate (hqqi 6= 0) is formed in this case, and, as a consequence, color symmetry\nis spontaneously broken down to the SUc (2) subgroup. A naive counting gives us five NG-bosons in this case (it is\njust the number of broken generators of the SUc (3) group). However, as it will be shown further, there are only three\ngapless bosonic excitations of the 2SC quark-matter ground state. Two of them satisfy the quadratic dispersion law,\nin agreement with the NC theorem.\nThe linearized version of Lagrangian (1) that contains auxiliary bosonic fields has the following form\nL\u0303 = q\u0304[\u03b3 \u03bd i\u2202\u03bd + \u03bc\u03b3 0 \u2212 \u03c3 \u2212 mo \u2212 i\u03b3 5~\u03c4 ~\u03c0 ]q \u2212\n\u2212\n\n\u03c3 2 + ~\u03c0 2\n\u2212\n4G1\n\ni\u2206\u2217\u03b4 C \u03b4 5 2\ni\u2206\u03b4 \u03b4 5 2 C\n\u2206\u2217\u03b4 \u2206\u03b4\n+\n[q\u0304 \u01eb \u03b3 \u03c4 q] \u2212\n[q\u0304\u01eb \u03b3 \u03c4 q ].\n4G2\n2\n2\n\n(3)\n\nLagrangians (1) and (3) are equivalent on the equations of motion for bosonic fields, from which it follows that\n\u2206\u03b4 \u223c q\u0304 C \u01eb\u03b4 \u03b3 5 q,\n\n\u03c3 \u223c q\u0304q,\n\n~\u03c0 \u223c iq\u0304\u03b3 5~\u03c4 q.\n\n(4)\n\nHowever, it is more convenient to start our consideration from Lagrangian (3). Clearly, the \u03c3 and ~\u03c0 fields are\ncolor singlets. Besides, the (bosonic) diquark field \u2206\u03b4 is a color antitriplet and a (isoscalar) singlet under the chiral\nSU (2)L \u00d7 SU (2)R group. Note further that \u03c3 and \u2206\u03b4 are (Lorentz) scalars, but ~\u03c0 are pseudoscalar fields. Hence, if\nh\u03c3i =\n6 0, then the chiral symmetry of the model is spontaneously broken (at mo = 0), whereas h\u2206\u03b4 i 6= 0 indicates the\ndynamical breaking of color symmetry. In the framework of the Nambu\u2013Gor'kov\n(for a recent relativistic\n\u0011\n\u0010 formalism\nq\ntreatment see, e.g. ref. [28]) quark fields are represented by a bispinor \u03a8 = qC . Integrating in the generating\nfunctional based on the Lagrangian (3) over the quark fields, one obtains an effective meson-diquark action of the\noriginal model (1)\n\u0014 2\n\u0015\n\u0013\n\u0012 +\nZ\n\u03c3 + ~\u03c0 2\ni\n\u2206\u03b4 \u2206\u2217\u03b4\nD K\u2212\nSeff (\u03c3, ~\u03c0 , \u2206\u03b4 , \u2206\u2217\u03b4 ) = \u2212 d4 x\n\u2212 Trsf cx ln\n.\n(5)\n+\nK + D\u2212\n4G1\n4G2\n2\n\nBesides of an evident trace over the two-dimensional Nambu\u2013Gor'kov matrix, the Tr-operation in (5) stands for calculating the trace in spinor- (s), flavor- (f ), color- (c) as well as four-dimensional coordinate- (x) spaces, correspondingly.\nWe have used also the following notations:\nK + = i\u2206\u2217\u03b4 \u01eb\u03b4 \u03b3 5 ,\nD = i\u03b3 \u2202\u03bd \u00b1 \u03bc\u03b3 0 \u2212 mo \u2212 \u03a3\u00b1 ,\n\u00b1\n\n\u03bd\n\nK \u2212 = \u2212i\u2206\u03b4 \u01eb\u03b4 \u03b3 5 ,\n\u03a3\u00b1 = \u03c3 \u00b1 i\u03b3 5~\u03c0~\u03c4 .\n\n(6)\n\nLet us introduce notations for the ground state expectation values of the meson and diquark fields: h\u03c3i = \u03c3o , h~\u03c0 i = ~\u03c0o ,\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\nh\u2206\u2217\u03b4 i = \u2206\u2217\u03b4\no , h\u2206 i = \u2206o and\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n(Ko\u00b1 , Do\u00b1 , \u03a3\u00b1\no ) = (K , D , \u03a3 )\n\u03c3=\u03c3o ,~\n\u03c0 =~\n\u03c0o ,\u2206\u03b4 =\u2206\u03b4o ,...\n\nThe quantities \u03c3o , \u03c0ok , \u2206\u03b4o , \u2206\u2217\u03b4\no (k, \u03b4 = 1, 2, 3) correspond to the global minimum of the effective potential Veff and can\nbe found as a solution of the system of equations\n\u2202Veff\n= 0,\n\u2202\u03c0 k\n\n\u2202Veff\n= 0,\n\u2202\u03c3\n\n\u2202Veff\n= 0,\n\u2202\u2206\u03b4\n\n\u2202Veff\n= 0,\n\u2202\u2206\u2217\u03b4\n\n(7)\n\n\f4\nusually called gap equations. In (7) we used the following definition of the effective potential:\nZ\nSeff\n= \u2212Veff (\u03c3, ~\u03c0 , \u2206\u03b4 , \u2206\u03b4 ) d4 x,\n\n(8)\n\n\u03c3,~\n\u03c0,\u2206\u03b4 ,\u2206\u03b4 =const\n\nwhere, in the spirit of the mean-field approximation, all fields are considered to be independent of x. Without loosing\nany generality of the consideration, one can search for a solution of equations (7) in the form: (\u22061o , \u22062o , \u22063o )\u2261 (0, 0, \u2206).\nMoreover, we suppose also that ~\u03c0o = 0. (The last assumption is maintained by the observation that in the theory of\nstrong interactions P-parity is a conserved quantity.) If \u2206 = 0, the color symmetry of the model remains intact. If\n\u2206 6= 0, then SUc (3) symmetry is spontaneously broken down to SUc (2), and the 2SC phase is realized in the model.\nIn this case, the system of gap equations (7) is reduced to the following one:\n\u001a\n\u001b\nZ\nd4 q\nE+\nE\u2212\n2E +\n2E \u2212\n\u03c3o\n,\n(9)\n= 4iM\n+ 2\n+\n+\n2G1\n(2\u03c0)4 E q02 \u2212 (E + )2\nq0 \u2212 (E \u2212 )2\nD+ (q0 ) D\u2212 (q0 )\n\u001b\n\u001a\nZ\n\u2206\nd4 q\n1\n1\n,\n(10)\n= 4i\u2206\n+\n4G2\n(2\u03c0)4 D+ (q0 ) D\u2212 (q0 )\nq\nwhere D\u00b1 (q0 ) = q02 \u2212 (E \u00b1 )2 \u2212 |\u2206|2 , E \u00b1 = E \u00b1 \u03bc, E = ~q 2 + M 2 , and M = mo + \u03c3o is the constituent quark mass.\nIn these and other similar expressions, q0 is a shorthand notation for q0 + i\u03b5 * sgn(q0 ), where the limit \u03b5 \u2192 0+ must\nbe taken at the end of all calculations. This prescription correctly implements the role of \u03bc as chemical potential and\npreserves the causality of the theory (see, e. g. [29]).\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\nLet us now make a field shift \u03c3(x) \u2192 \u03c3(x) + \u03c3o , \u2206\u2217\u03b4 (x) \u2192 \u2206\u2217\u03b4 (x) + \u2206\u2217\u03b4\no , \u2206 (x) \u2192 \u2206 (x) + \u2206o and then expand\n(2)\nthe expression (5) into a power series of the meson and diquark fields.

Since we are mainly interested in the diquark sector, the expression for the \u03c0-meson effective action\n(2)\n(2)\nS\u03c0\u03c0 (~\u03c0 ) is omitted here. Moreover, S\u03c33 (\u03c3, \u22063 , \u2206\u22173 ) has a rather cumbersome form, so we also do not show it. (If\nneeded, both these expressions can be obtained immediately from (11).)\nBefore proceeding further, we should fix the parameters of our model. Here, we choose the parametrization procedure\ngiven in [14]. We simplify that model by ignoring the corrections to the pion-quark coupling constant that come from\nthe mixing between the pion and axial-vector. To fix the model parameters, we require the model to reproduce\nthe Goldberger-Treiman relation M g\u03c0 = F\u03c0 , where F\u03c0 \u2248 93 MeV is the pion weak-decay constant, and g\u03c0 is the\npion-quark coupling constant determined in the local NJL model as follows\nZ\n\u2212iNc\nd4 q\ng\u03c0\u22122 =\n.\n(19)\n4\n2\n(2\u03c0)\n(q \u2212 M 2 )2\n(This integral is divergent, and a regularization is supposed to be implemented here. In our work we use a threedimensional cutoff to make such integrals meaningful.)\nThen, we require the observed pion mass (\u223c 140 MeV) to be reproduced by the local NJL model with our parameters.\nAfter this, one more condition is needed to complete the parameter fixing procedure. We consider two possibilities\nto finalize it: i) fix the model parameters so that the QCD sum rules estimate for the chiral condensate hq\u0304qi \u2248\n(\u2212245 MeV)3 is reproduced in our model, ii) choose the model parameters in a way that allows one to obtain the\ncorrect description of the \u03c1 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 decay, as it was done in [14]. In the first case (let us refer to this set of parameters as\nset-A), the cutoff \u039b is about 618 MeV, the four-quark interaction constant G1 is equal to 5.86 GeV\u22122 . The remaining\nconstant, G2 , is chosen according to the Fierz-transformation as G2 = 3G1 /4 = 4.40 GeV \u22122 . The current quark\nmass mo is fixed via the gap equations to the value: 5.7 MeV. The constituent quark mass in the vacuum (at zeroth\ntemperature and chemical potential) amounts to 350 MeV.\nIn the second case, we obtain a different set of model parameters, which will be referred to, throughout the paper,\nas the set-B. Imposing the condition that an extension of this model to the vector channel would give the experimental\nvalue for the \u03c1-meson width (the \u03c1-meson decays mostly into a couple of charged pions, and the decay is described\nby the constant g\u03c1 \u2248 6.1.) and keeping in mind that in\u221athe local NJL model one gets a natural connection between\ng\u03c1 and g\u03c0 (discarding pion\u2013axial-vector transitions), 6g\u03c1 = g\u03c0 , we obtain \u039b = 856 MeV, G1 = 2.49 GeV\u22122 ,\nG2 = 3G1 /4 = 1.87 GeV\u22122 , and m0 = 3.6 MeV. In the vacuum the constituent quark mass is 233 MeV, which is\nsmall, compared to the case, where the chiral condensate is used to fix the model parameters3. A similar procedure\nhas been implemented in [27] in the chiral limit. Here, we keep the current quark mass non-zero in order to reproduce\nthe pion mass in the vacuum.\nSolving the gap equations at a fixed chemical potential, we obtain the constituent quark mass M and the color gap\n\u2206 that satisfy the global minimum of the effective potential. In Figs. 1 and 2, one can see the quark mass M and\nthe color gap \u2206 vs. the chemical potential for parameter sets A and B. For the parameter set A, one observes a\nfirst-order phase transition from hadron matter to the 2SC phase. The gaps (constituent quark mass and color gap)\nchange abruptly when the chemical potential reaches the vacuum value of M (see Fig. 1). On the contrary, if the\nparameter set-B is chosen, the gaps reveal a rather smooth character near the phase transition, which is typical for a\nphase transition of the second-order (see Fig. 2).\nIII.\n\nGAPLESS EXCITATIONS IN THE DIQUARK SECTORS\n\nSince \u22061 in (17) is not mixed with other fields, let us, first of all, focus on the diquark \u22061 -sector. If \u22061 (x) =\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(2)\n(\u03c61 (x)+i\u03c62 (x))/ 2, \u2206\u22171 (x) = (\u03c61 (x)\u2212i\u03c62 (x))/ 2, then the effective action S1 (\u22061 , \u2206\u22171 ) from (17) can be presented\nin the form:\nZ\n1\n(2)\n(2)\nS1 (\u22061 , \u2206\u22171 ) \u2261 S1 (\u03c61 , \u03c62 ) = \u2212\nd4 x d4 y\u03c6k (x)\u0393kl (x \u2212 y)\u03c6l (y),\n(20)\n2\nwhere the 2 \u00d7 2 matrix \u0393(x \u2212 y) is the inverse propagator of the \u03c61 , \u03c62 -fields (summation over k, l = 1, 2 is implied\n(2)\nin (20)). Its matrix elements can be found via a second variation of S1 :\n(2)\n\n\u0393kl (x \u2212 y) = \u2212\n\n3\n\n\u03b4 2 S1\n.\n\u03b4\u03c6l (y)\u03b4\u03c6k (x)\n\n(21)\n\nA larger quark mass can be obtained if one takes into account the mixing between the pion and axial-vector. However, we omit it in\nour paper for simplicity and for the reason that this mixing is negligible in the 2SC phase.\n\n\f6\n\n350\n300\n\nM, \u2206 [MeV]\n\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n\u03bc [MeV]\n\nFIG. 1: The constituent quark mass M (solid line) and the color gap \u2206 (dashed line) as functions of the chemical potential\n(parameter set-A).\n\n250\n\nM, \u2206 [MeV]\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n\u03bc [MeV]\n\nFIG. 2: The constituent quark mass M (solid line) and the color gap \u2206 (dashed line) as functions of the chemical potential\n(parameter set-B).\n\n\f7\nIn momentum space, the Fourier-transformed components of the \u0393-matrix have the following structure\n\u039311 (p) = \u039322 (p) =\n\n\u0001\n1\n\u0393\u2206\u2217 \u2206 (p) + \u0393\u2206\u2217 \u2206 (\u2212p) ,\n2\n\n\u039312 (p) = \u2212\u039321 (p) =\n\n\u0001\ni\n\u0393\u2206\u2217 \u2206 (p) \u2212 \u0393\u2206\u2217 \u2206 (\u2212p) .\n2\n\n(22)\n\nThe derivation of these relations is given in Appendix, where the quantity \u0393\u2206\u2217 \u2206 (p) is also presented (see eq.

They are the squared masses of excited states in the \u22061 -sector of the model. Moreover, all these\nformulae are then greatly simplified. Indeed, it follows from (A5) at p~ 2 = 0 that\n\u001b\n\u001a\nZ\nd4 q\n1\n1\n\u0393\u2206\u2217 \u2206 (p0 ) = 4ip0\n\u2261 \u22124p0 H(p0 ),\n(24)\n+\n(2\u03c0)4 (p0 + q0 + E + )D+ (q0 ) (p0 + q0 \u2212 E \u2212 )D\u2212 (q0 )\nwhere it is possible to integrate over q0 , using the following prescription: (p0 + q0 ) \u2192 (p0 + q0 ) + i\u03b5 * sgn(p0 + q0 ) and\nq0 \u2192 q0 + i\u03b5 * sgn(q0 ) with \u03b5 \u2192 0+ (see also comments after formula (10)), and\n\u001a\n\u001b\nZ\nd3 q\n1\n\u03b8(E \u2212 )\n\u03b8(\u2212E \u2212 )\n1\n.\n(25)\nH(p0 ) = \u2212\n+\n+ +\n\u2212\n\u2212 +\n\u2212\n\u2212\n2 (2\u03c0)3 (p0 + E + + E\u2206\n)E\u2206\n(p0 \u2212 E \u2212 \u2212 E\u2206\n)E\u2206\n(p0 \u2212 E \u2212 + E\u2206\n)E\u2206\np\n\u00b1\nIn (25) E\u2206\n= (E \u00b1 )2 + |\u2206|2 . Since the integral in the RHS of this equation is ultraviolet divergent, we regularize it,\nas the other divergent integrals, by using a three-dimensional cutoff \u039b, i. e. ~q 2 \u2264 \u039b2 . Then, eq. (23) is transformed\nto\np20 H(p0 )H(\u2212p0 ) = 0,\n\n(26)\n\nfrom which it is evident that there is a solution p20 = 0, corresponding to a gapless excitation of the 2SC ground state.\nSince the function H(p0 ) does not vanish at p0 = 0 and \u03bc 6= 0, this solution may be identified in the case of finite p~2\nwith a NG-boson with the quadratic dispersion law: p0 \u223c ~p 2 /H(0) (see Appendix). Now, let us suppose that at some\nnonzero value p0 = \u2212m1 the function H(p0 ) has a zero, i. e. H(\u2212m1 ) = 0. Then, det\u0393(p0 ) has two zeroes p0 = \u00b1m1 ,\ni. e. the point p20 = m21 is a solution of eq. (26), and the second bosonic excitation of this sector has the nonzero mass\nm1 . In the low-p0 expansion we have: H(p0 ) = H(0) + p0 H \u2032 (0) + * * *, where\n\u001a\n\u001b\nZ\n1\nd3 q\n\u03b8(E \u2212 )\n\u03b8(\u2212E \u2212 )\n1\nH(0) =\n,\n\u2212\n\u2212 +\n\u2212\n\u2212 \u2212\n+\n+\n2\n(2\u03c0)3 (E \u2212 + E\u2206\n)E\u2206\n(E \u2212 \u2212 E\u2206\n)E\u2206\n(E + + E\u2206\n)E\u2206\n\u001a\n\u001b\nZ\nd3 q\n\u03b8(E \u2212 )\n\u03b8(\u2212E \u2212 )\n1\n1\n\u2032\n.\n(27)\nH (0) =\n\u2212\n\u2212 2 +\n\u2212 2 \u2212 +\n+\n+ 2\n2\n(2\u03c0)3 E\u2206\n(E \u2212 + E\u2206\n)\n(E \u2212 \u2212 E\u2206\n) E\u2206\nE\u2206\n(E + + E\u2206\n)\nThus, in this approximation m1 = H(0)/H \u2032 (0). The m1 vs. \u03bc plots for particular values of the coupling constants\nG1 , G2 and the cutoff parameter \u039b discussed at the end of section 2 (or, equivalently, for the values \u2206 and M from\nFigs. 1 and 2) are presented in Figs. 3 and 4. In Fig. 3 the values of m1 are calculated for \u03bc = 350 \u00f7 400 MeV when the\nparameter set-A is involved. The leftmost point corresponds to the condition of the phase transition (\u03bc \u2248 350 MeV).\nAt smaller \u03bc the color gap equals zero and eqs. (27) cannot be applied, since they have been derived by using eq. (10)\nwith \u2206 6= 0. Similarly, in Fig. 4 the axis \u03bc begins with 250 MeV. At smaller \u03bc, (but grater than 233 MeV), the value\nof m1 is almost zero. Common to both parameter sets A and B is that the values of m1 are small and thus justify\nthe series expansion of the function H(p0 ) around p0 = 0.4 Analogous results are obtained for the \u22062 -sector of the\nmodel. There, as in the \u22061 -sector, only one massless boson with the quadratic dispersion law as well as a massive\none with the mass m2 \u2261 m1 are found. Evidently, the two massless and two massive bosons in the \u22061 , \u22062 -sectors\nform antidoublets with respect to the unbroken SUc (2) symmetry.\nNow let us consider the sector with mixing of the complex diquark \u22063 -field and the scalar \u03c3-meson. Introducing\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(2)\nnew real fields: \u03c6(x) = (\u22063 (x) + \u2206\u22173 (x))/ 2, \u03c8(x) = i(\u2206\u22173 (x) \u2212 \u22063 (x))/ 2, we rewrite the effective action S\u03c33 (here\nwe omit the cumbersome expression for this quantity, however it can be easily reproduced from (11)) in the following\nform:\nZ\n1\n(2)\n3\n\u22173\nS\u03c33 (\u03c3, \u2206 , \u2206 ) = \u2212\nd4 x d4 y(\u03c3(x), \u03c6(x), \u03c8(x)) \u03a0(x \u2212 y) (\u03c3(y), \u03c6(y), \u03c8(y))t ,\n(28)\n2\n\n4\n\nThe numerical investigation shows that the mass value m1 found in the low-p0 approximation (see Figs. 3 and 4) differs from the exact\nsolution of the equation H(m1 ) = 0 by no more than 10%.\n\n\f8\n\nm 1 [MeV]\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n350\n\n375\n\n400\n\n\u03bc [MeV]\n\nFIG. 3: The diquark mass m1 = H(0)/H \u2032 (0) as a function of the chemical potential (parameter set-A).\n\n35\n\n30\n\n[MeV]\n\n25\n\n20\n\nm1\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n\u03bc [MeV]\n\nFIG. 4: The diquark mass m1 = H(0)/H \u2032 (0) as a function of the chemical potential (parameter set-B).\n\n\f9\nwhere \u03a0(x \u2212 y) is the inverse propagator of the \u03c3-meson and the diquark fields \u03c6, \u03c8. Clearly, it is a 3\u00d73 matrix,\n(2)\nwhose elements can be obtained from (28) by taking all second variational derivatives of S\u03c33 over the fields \u03c3, \u03c6, and\n\u03c8. We have calculated the momentum-space matrix \u03a0(p) (corresponding explicit formulae and relations are omitted),\nand then, putting p = (p0 , 0, 0, 0), found that det(\u03a0(p0 )) has only one zero at p20 = 0. Therefore, only one NG-boson,\nwhich is an SUc (2)-singlet, exists in this sector (as in the \u22061 , \u22062 -sectors, each zero of det(\u03a0(p0 )) in the p20 -plane\nmeans the mass squared of the ground-state excitation, this time in the mixed \u03c3-\u22063 sector). 5\nAs it was mentioned above, in the 2SC phase of the model, where \u2206 6= 0, the color SUc (3) symmetry of the ground\nstate is spontaneously broken down to the SUc (2) group. Hence, in accordance with the Goldstone theorem, it is\ngenerally expected that five NG-bosons would appear in the theory. However, we have proved that in the \u22061 , \u22062 , \u22063 sectors of the model only three massless bosons exist, which can be identified with NG-bosons. Therefore, there seems\nto be a deficiency of two NG-bosons in the framework of the model under consideration. In spite of this fact, there are,\nhowever, no contradictions with the NC theorem, since two of the three found NG-bosons have quadratic dispersion\nlaws for |~\np| \u2192 0. In addition, the model contains also light massive diquarks.\nUsually, in the framework of the NJL model, the 2SC phase is studied in the region of coupling constants (2). In\nthis case, at \u03bc = 0 we have a chirally noninvariant phase even if mo \u2192 0, and the transition to the 2SC phase occurs\nat some finite value of the chemical potential. Formally, however, one can consider the region\n\u03c9 = {(G1 , G2 ) : G2 > \u03c0 2 /(4\u039b2 ), \u03c0 2 (G2 \u2212 G1 ) > 2G1 G2 \u039b2 },\n\n(29)\n\nwhere (even at \u03bc = 0) the 2SC phase is realized [31]. As can easily be seen from (27), in the case of \u03bc = 0 we have\nH(0) = 0 and m1 = m2 = 0, and the total number of gapless excitations (NG-bosons) in the \u22061 - and \u22062 -sectors of\nthe model equals four. They form two massless SUc (2)-antidoublets. Apart from this, there is one NG-boson, which\nis an SUc (2)-singlet, in the mixed \u03c3-\u22063 sector. Naturally, all these excitations have a linear dispersion law, as it\nshould be in the relativistically invariant case (see Appendix). However, at an arbitrary small \u03bc, particles from one of\nthese antidoublets acquire nonzero masses, and the dispersion laws for the two massless particles from the remaining\nantidoublet are changed essentially from the linear to quadratic laws.\nNote finally, that in the above consideration we used the real/imaginary part parametrization for diquark fields:\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u22061 (x) = (\u03c61 (x) + i\u03c62 (x))/ 2, \u22062 (x) = (\u03c6\u03031 (x) + i\u03c6\u03032 (x))/ 2, \u22063 (x) \u2212 \u2206 = (\u03c6(x) + i\u03c8(x))/ 2,\n(30)\nwhere \u2206\u03c1 (x) are the unshifted diquark fields from Lagrangian (3) and \u2206 = h\u22063 i. However, one can use also an\nalternative \"polar coordinate\" parametrization:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb 1\n\uf8f6\n)\n(\n\u03be5 \u2212 i\u03be4\n0\n\u2206 (x)\nX \u03bbt \u03bea (x)\n1\n1\na\n\uf8f8 + o(\u03bei , \u03b7),\n\uf8f8 = \u221a \uf8ed \u221a \u03be7 \u2212 i\u03be6\n\uf8ed \u22062 (x) \uf8f8 = exp \u2212i\n0\n\u221a\n\u221a \uf8ed\u221a\n(31)\n2\n3\n2\u2206\n2\n2\n\u221a\n2\u2206 + \u03b7 + i 3 \u03be8\n\u2206 (x)\na\n2\u2206 + \u03b7(x)\n\nwhere \u03bba are Gell-Mann matrices and the summation over a = 4, .., 8 is implied (the form of an exponential multiplier\nin (31) corresponds to the fact that \u2206\u03c1 (x) is an SUc (3)-antitriplet). Comparing (30) and (31) at small \u03bei , \u03b7, we see\nthat\n2\n\u03c61 = \u03be5 , \u03c62 = \u2212\u03be4 , \u03c6\u03031 = \u03be7 , \u03c6\u03032 = \u2212\u03be6 , \u03c6 = \u03b7, \u03c8 = \u221a \u03be8 .\n3\n\n(32)\n\nFurther, one should insert (31) into (5) and expand the resulting expression into a series of meson- and \u03bea , \u03b7 fields. It\nis easily seen that in the second order of the new variables the effective action is a sum similar to (17). In particular,\nit means that the diquark fields \u03be4 , \u03be5 are decoupled from other fields, and their effective action looks like (20) with\nthe replacement (32) used. So, some elements of the inverse propagator matrix for \u03be4 , \u03be5 fields differ by a sign from\n\u0393kl (x \u2212 y) (21), but the determinant of the whole momentum space matrix is not changed. Hence, the mass spectrum,\nthe dispersion laws etc., in the \u03be4 , \u03be5 -fields are the same, as in the case with old fields \u03c61 , \u03c62 . Similar conclusions\nare valid for the rest of new variables, i. e. such physical characteristics of the model, as particle masses, dispersion\nlaws etc., do not depend on the choice of field parametrizations, (30) or (31). In particular, the number of abnormal\nNG-bosons, which equals three in the model under consideration, is a parametrization invariant quantity6 .\n\n5\n6\n\nA detailed investigation of the meson/diquark spectrum including the \u03c3-\u22063 mixing is in preparation.\nIn papers [4, 5] an abnormal number of NG-bosons in the same SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) toy model was discovered. But in [4] the parametrization\n(30) was used for the scalar doublet, whereas in [5] a \"polar coordinate\" parametrization, similar to (31), was used. Evidently, their\nresults coincide, i.e. the abnormal number of NG-bosons, particle masses, formulae for dispersion laws are the same.\n\n\f10\nIV.\n\nCOLOR\u2013ASYMMETRY AND MASSES OF SCALAR DIQUARKS\n\nAs it was noted in [12], the color superconducting phase is automatically color-neutral in QCD, but this does not\nhold for the NJL model under consideration. Massive scalar diquarks and, as a consequence, the abnormal number\nof NG-bosons in the model discussed in previous sections testify for this. As mentioned in the Introduction, for\nthe number of NG-bosons to equal the number of broken generators of the underlying symmetry group (in our case\nSUc (3)), the ground-state expectation value for the commutator of any two broken symmetry generators Qa and Qb\nmust be zero: h[Qa , Qb ]i = 0 [5]. This criterion is not fulfilled for the NJL model considered here, namely, the ground\nstate expectation value of the color charge operator Q8 = q\u0304\u03b3 0 \u03bb8 q does not vanish, and, therefore, the usual counting\nrule for NG-bosons is not applicable.\nLet us look at the function H(p0 ) at p0 = 0. One can rewrite the expression (27) in a different form:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n1\nd3 q 1\nE+\nE\u2212\nH(0) =\n\u22122\u03b8(\u03bc\n\u2212\nE)\n+\n\u2212\n.\n(33)\n+\n\u2212\n2\n(2\u03c0)3 \u22062\nE\u2206\nE\u2206\nThis formula can be expressed in terms of quark densities. For this purpose, we need the expression of the thermodynamical potential of the system, which in the mean-field approximation is equal to the value of Veff in its global\nminimum point, supplied by the gap equations, i. e.\n\u03a9(\u03bc) = Veff (\u03c3o , ~\u03c0o , \u2206\u03b4o , \u2206\u2217\u03b4\no ),\n\n(34)\n\nwhere Veff was given in (8). Further, one can divide the thermodynamical potential into several terms:\n\u03a9(\u03bc) =\n\n3\nX\n\n\u03a9c (\u03bc) +\n\nc=1\n\n|\u2206|2\n(M \u2212 mo )2\n+\n,\n4G1\n4G2\n\nwhere \u03a9c (\u03bc) is the contribution from the color-c quark, defined as follows:\nZ\n\u0001\nd3 q\n+\n\u2212\nE\u2206\n+ E\u2206\n,\n\u03a91 (\u03bc) = \u03a92 (\u03bc) = \u22122\n3\n(2\u03c0)\nZ\n\u0001\nd3 q\n\u03a93 (\u03bc) = \u22122\n|E + | + |E \u2212 | .\n3\n(2\u03c0)\n\n(35)\n\n(36)\n\nThe contribution from color-1 and color-2 quarks, \u03a91(2) (\u03bc) are equal due to the remaining SUc (2) color symmetry\nafter the global SUc (3) symmetry group is spontaneously broken in the color superconducting phase. The third color\nquark, which does not condensate, gives \u03a93 (\u03bc). Then, one can calculate the densities nc of color-1, -2, and -3 quarks\nseparately without introducing additional chemical potentials for each color simply by differentiating \u03a9c (\u03bc) over \u03bc,\ni. e.\nnc = \u2212\n\nn1 = n2 = 2\n\nZ\n\nd3 q\n(2\u03c0)3\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202\u03a9c (\u03bc)\n,\n\u2202\u03bc\n\nE+\nE\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\nE\u2206\nE\u2206\n\nc = 1, 2, 3;\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\nn3 = 4\n\n(37)\n\nZ\n\nd3 q\n\u03b8(\u03bc \u2212 E).\n(2\u03c0)3\n\n(38)\n\nEq. (33) can thus be transformed to\n1\nH(0) =\n(n1 + n2 \u2212 2n3 ) =\n8\u22062\n\n\u221a\n3hQ8 i\n.\n8\u22062\n\n(39)\n\nFrom eq. (39) and the fact that the diquark mass m1 = H(0)/H \u2032 (0) is found to be nonzero (see Figs. 3 and 4), one\nconcludes that the 2SC-ground state in the NJL model under consideration has finite color charge hQ8 i. Evidently,\nthis fact is related to the inequality of color quark densities n1,2 > n3 for paired (1,2) and unpaired (3) quarks, i. e.\nto color-asymmetry. Moreover, as discussed in Appendix, the nonzero value of H(0) is responsible for the abnormal\ndispersion law p0 \u223c ~\np 2 /H(0) for two NG-bosons.\nTo restore the local color neutrality in the NJL model, one can, e. g., include an additional term, \u03bc8 Q8 , and impose\nthe color neutrality condition:\nhQ8 i = \u2212\n\n\u2202\u03a9(\u03bc, \u03bc8 )\n= 0,\n\u2202\u03bc8\n\n(40)\n\nor consider the superconducting matter as composed of colored domains, with the global color charge being equal\nzero. The latter, however, goes beyond the mean-field approximation exploited here and should be considered as an\n\n\f11\napproximation for the case of large colored domains. Anyway, the true ground state should be checked to give the\nabsolute minimum of the thermodynamical potential.\nThe inclusion of an additional chemical potential \u03bc8 \"by hand\", however, does not contradict QCD. As discussed\nin [12], a non-vanishing expectation value of the gluon field A80 , corresponding to the eighth generator in the SUc (3)\ngroup, gives rise to a non-vanishing value of \u03bc8 , which then cancels certain tadpole contributions and restores the\ncolor neutrality. This cannot occur in the NJL model automatically because there are no gluons in it.\nV.\n\nSUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS\n\nRecently, it has been shown that in QCD with a nonzero strangeness chemical potential the number of NG-bosons\ncan be less than the number of broken symmetry generators [4, 5], so that the usual counting rule for NG-bosons\nevidently does not hold. In the present paper, we have presented another relativistic model providing us with an\nabnormal number of NG-bosons. This is an NJL\u2013type model with two light-quark flavors, where a single quark\nchemical potential is taken into account. In the color superconducting phase of this model, the color SUc (3) group is\nspontaneously broken down to SUc (2), i. e. the number of broken symmetry generators equals five. Despite of this\nfact, there appeared only three NG-bosons in the 2SC phase; two of them form an antidoublet with respect to the\nunbroken SUc (2) subgroup and have quadratic dispersion laws. The remaining one is an SUc (2)-singlet, so there are\nno contradictions with the NC theorem [3]. Moreover, there exists an SUc (2)-antidoublet of light diquarks \u22061 , \u22062\nwith masses m1 , the behavior of which at final chemical potential \u03bc is shown in Figs. 3 and 4 for the parameter sets\nA and B, respectively.\nMost interestingly, we found that the\u221adiquark masses m1 = H(0)/H \u2032 (0) are proportional to the ground state average\nof the color charge operator hQ8 i = 1/ 3(n1 + n2 \u2212 2n3 ). Here, the quark densities n1 , n2 of paired quarks with color1,2 are equal due to the remaining SUc (2) symmetry and larger than the density n3 of the unpaired color-3 quark.\nThus, the ground state of the considered NJL-type model is evidently color-asymmetric. It is just the appearance of\nthis nonvanishing expectation value hQ8 i which simultaneously leads to a violation of the criterion for the equality\nof the number of NG-bosons and broken symmetry generators [5], and to the appearance of the quadratic dispersion\nlaw for the NG-diquarks (compare eqs. (38), (A6)).\nIn the investigations of color superconductivity in the two-flavored QCD, five scalar NG-bosons are argued to exist.\nThey are mixing with gluons and required as longitudinal components for five massive gluons (color Meissner effect)\n[10]. The fact that we find an abnormal number of three NG-bosons does not directly contradict QCD. Namely, in the\ncolor superconducting phase of QCD a nonvanishing condensate of the eighth gluon field component A80 appears, which\ninduces a color chemical potential \u03bc8 and cancels certain tadpole contributions, responsible for the nonvanishing color\ncharge of the ground state [12]. This mechanism just leads to color neutrality. Obviously, there arises the question,\nhow can one reconcile the considered NJL approach with QCD? Insofar as NJL-type models do not contain gluon\nfields, the required contribution from the condensed eighth gluon field does not follow automatically. Therefore, the\ntadpole contribution becomes unbalanced by gluon contributions. It can be be cancelled \"by hand\", e. g. with the\nhelp of the additional color chemical potential \u03bc8 simulating the omitted gluon contribution. In such enlarged NJL\nmodels the condition of color neutrality of the ground state, i. e. hQ8 i = 0, can be imposed as an additional physical\nrequirement [11]. According to our results, one gets in this case two additional NG-bosons as well as a change of\nquadratic dispersion laws into normal linear ones. Thus, the abnormal number of three NG-bosons might, in principle,\nbecome converted into the normal number five found in QCD.\nNevertheless, what to do now with these five NG-bosons arising in the color neutral 2SC-phase of an enlarged\nNJL-type model? Clearly, in the framework of the standard NJL model one cannot apply the color Meissner effect,\nin order to absorb these NG-bosons into longitudinal degrees of freedom of massive gluons. A possible way out of\nthis problem could be an extension of the NJL mode via the inclusion of perturbative gluons, fluctuating around the\noriginal low-energy gluonic fields (realized e. g. by instantons or other non-perturbative background fields, which were\nalready integrated out to yield the effective four-quark interactions) [32]. Obviously, the color Meissner effect could\nthen be realized for such perturbative gluons.\nIn addition, let us remark that the above discussions refer to the case of locally neutral quark matter, where\ncolor neutrality should indeed be required. On the other hand, global color neutrality does not demand local color\nneutrality: for example, one can assume the ground state as being composed of colored domains. Anyway, to decide\nwhich of the considered ground states is in favor, the absolute minimum of the thermodynamic potential should be\ncalculated in each case. (Note that the presence of domains means a violation of translational invariance and is not\nconsistent with the simple mean-field approach.)\nFinally, notice that in the framework of the considered NJL-type of model there arises a mixing between the \u03c3meson and \u22063 -diquark in the 2SC phase. The behavior of \u03c3-, \u22063 - as well as \u03c0-meson masses vs. \u03bc in the 2SC phase\nis now under consideration.\n\n\f12\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work has been supported in part by DFG-project 436 RUS 113/477/0-2, RFBR grant 02-02-16194, the\nHeisenberg\u2013Landau Program, and the \"Dynasty\" Foundation.\nAPPENDIX A: THE \u0393-MATRIX ELEMENTS AND DISPERSION LAWS\n\nUsing the effective action (18), let us introduce auxiliary quantities\n(2)\n\n\u0393\u2206\u2217 \u2206 (z) = \u2212\n\n\b\n\u03b4(z)\n\u03b4 2 S1\n\u2212 iTrsc a(z)\u01eb1 \u03b3 5 d(\u2212z)\u01eb1 \u03b3 5 ,\n=\n1\n\u22171\n\u03b4\u2206 (y)\u03b4\u2206 (x)\n4G2\n(2)\n\n\u0393\u2206\u2206\u2217 (z) = \u2212\n\n\b\n\u03b4(z)\n\u03b4 2 S1\n\u2212 iTrsc d(z)\u01eb1 \u03b3 5 a(\u2212z)\u01eb1 \u03b3 5 ,\n=\n\u03b4\u2206\u22171 (y)\u03b4\u22061 (x)\n4G2\n\n(A1)\n\nwhere \u03b4(z) is the Dirac \u03b4-function, z = x \u2212 y and a(z), d(z) are operators (13) and (16), respectively.

Moreover, Eq \u2261 E = ~q 2 + M 2 . Note, that expression\n(A5) is obtained under the assumption that \u2206 6= 0, i. e. it is valid only in the 2SC phase. In this case, the gap\nequation (10) was used to eliminate the coupling constant G2 from relation (A4) in favour of other model parameters.\nQuasiparticle dispersion laws are defined by (23) or, equivalently, by the two equations \u0393\u2206\u2217 \u2206 (\u00b1p) = 0. One can\neasily see that at p~ 2 = 0 the first integral in RHS of (A5) coincides with (24) having an evident zero at p0 = 0. This\nis just the dispersion law of a gapless particle (NG-boson) at p~ 2 = 0. Let us find the dispersion law for the NG-boson\nat small nonzero values of p~ 2 , i. e. try to solve the equation \u0393\u2206\u2217 \u2206 (p) = 0 at p \u2192 0. Expanding expression (A5)\ninto a Taylor-series of (p0 , p~) at the point (0, ~0) and taking into account only leading terms, we have, at \u03bc 6= 0, the\nfollowing equation connecting the energy and momentum of the massless particle (in section III, it was proved that\nsuch a particle, NG-boson, exists in the \u22061 -sector of the model):\n\u001a\n\u001b\nZ\n2~q 2\nd4 q\n4i~\np2\n1\u2212\n\u2212\n\u0393\u2206\u2217 \u2206 (p) \u2261 4ip0 H(0) \u2212\n(2\u03c0)4\nD\u2212 (q0 )[(q0 + \u03bc)2 \u2212 Eq2 ]\n3Eq (q0 + \u03bc \u2212 Eq )\n\u001a\n\u001b\nZ\n4i~\np2\n2~q 2\nd4 q\n\u2212\n1\n+\n+ * * * = 0,\n(A6)\n(2\u03c0)4\nD+ (q0 )[(q0 + \u03bc)2 \u2212 Eq2 ]\n3Eq (q0 + \u03bc + Eq )\n\n\f13\nwhere the quantity H(0) (which is nonzero at \u03bc 6= 0) is given in (27). Obviously, the quadratic dispersion law, p0 \u223c ~p 2 ,\nfor a massless particle follows from (A6). However, in case of relativistic invariance of the system (i. e. at \u03bc = 0 and\nfor coupling constants from the region \u03c9 (29)), or for a color-neutral ground state, when H(0) = 0, the dispersion law\nfor a NG-boson changes. Indeed, in this case the term 4ip0 H(0) from (A6) should be replaced by 4ip20 H \u2032 (0) (H \u2032 (0)\nis presented in (27)), and one arrives at a linear dispersion law for NG-bosons.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n[26]\n[27]\n[28]\n[29]\n[30]\n[31]\n[32]\n\nJ.
