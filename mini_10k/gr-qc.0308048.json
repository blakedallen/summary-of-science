gravity remains an outstanding problem of fundamental physics. The bottom\nline is we don't even know the nature of the system that should be quantized. The\nspacetime metric may well be just a collective description of some more basic stuff. The\nfact[1] that the semi-classical Einstein equation can be derived by demanding that the\nfirst law of thermodynamics hold for local causal horizons, assuming the proportionality of entropy and area, leads one to suspect that the metric is only meaningful in\nthe thermodynamic limit of something else. This led me at first to suggest that the\nmetric shouldn't be quantized at all. However I think this is wrong. Condensed matter\nphysics abounds with examples of collective modes that become meaningless at short\nlength scales, and which are nevertheless accurately treated as quantum fields within\nthe appropriate domain. (Consider for example the sound field in a Bose-Einstein condensate of atoms, which loses meaning at scales below the so-called \"healing length\",\nwhich is still several orders of magnitude longer than the atomic size of the fundamental\nconstituents.) Similarly, there exists a perfectly good perturbative approach to quantum gravity in the framework of low energy effective field theory[2]. However, this is\nnot regarded as a solution to the problem of quantum gravity, since the most pressing\nquestions are non-perturbative in nature: the nature and fate of spacetime singularities,\nthe fate of Cauchy horizons, the nature of the microstates counted by black hole entropy,\nand the possible unification of gravity with other interactions.\nAt a shallower level, the perturbative approach of effective field theory is nevertheless\nrelevant both for its indications about the deeper questions and for its application to\nphysics phenomena in their own right. It leads in particular to the subject of quantum\nfield theory in curved spacetime backgrounds, and the \"back-reaction\" of the quantum\nfields on such backgrounds. Some of the most prominent of these applications are the\nHawking radiation by black holes, primordial density perturbations, and early universe\nphase transitions. It also fits into the larger category of quantum field theory (qft)\nin inhomogeneous and/or time-dependent backgrounds of other fields or matter media,\nand is also intimately tied to non-inertial effects in flat space qft such as the Unruh\neffect. The pertubative approach is also known as \"semi-classical quantum gravity\",\nwhich refers to the setting where there is a well-defined classical background geometry\nabout which the quantum fluctuations are occuring.\nThe present notes are an introduction to some of the essentials and phenomena of\nquantum field theory in curved spacetime. Familiarity with quantum mechanics and\ngeneral relativity are assumed. Where computational steps are omitted I expect that\n4\n\n\fthe reader can fill these in as an exercise.\nGiven the importance of the subject, it is curious that there are not very many\nbooks dedicated to it. The standard reference by Birrell and Davies[3] was published\ntwenty years ago, and another monograph by Grib, Mamaev, and Mostapanenko[4], half\nof which addresses strong background field effects in flat spacetime, was published two\nyears earlier originally in Russian and then in English ten years ago. Two books with a\nsomewhat more limited scope focusing on fundamentals with a mathematically rigorous\npoint of view are those by Fulling[5] and Wald[6]. This year DeWitt[7] published a\ncomprehensive two volume treatise with a much wider scope but including much material\non quantum fields in curved spacetime. A number of review articles (see e.g. [8, 9, 10,\n11, 12, 13]) and many shorter introductory lecture notes (see e.g. [14, 15, 16]) are also\navailable. For more information on topics not explicitly referenced in the text of these\nnotes the above references should be consulted.\nIn these notes the units are chosen with c = 1 but ~ and G are kept explicit. The\nspacetime signature is (+\u2212\u2212\u2212). Please send corrections if you find things here that are\nwrong.\n\n2\n\nPlanck length and black hole thermodynamics\n\nThanks to a scale separation it is useful to distinguish quantum field theory in a curved\nbackground spacetime (qftcs) from true quantum gravity (qg). Before launching into\nthe qftcs formalism, it seems worthwhile to have a quick look at some of the interesting\nissues that qftcs is concerned with.\n\n2.1\n\nPlanck length\n\nIt is usually presumed that the length scale of quantum gravity is the Planck length\nLP = (~G/c3 )1/2 \u2248 10\u221233 cm. The corresponding energy scale is 1019 GeV. Recent\n\"braneworld scenarios\", in which our 4d world is a hypersurface in a higher dimensional\nspacetime, put the scale of quantum gravity much lower, at around a TeV, corresponding\nto LTeV = 1016 LP \u2248 10\u221217 cm. In either case, there is plenty of room for applicability\nof qftcs. (On the other hand, we are much closer to seeing true qg effects in TeV scale\nqg. For example we might see black hole creation and evaporation in cosmic rays or\naccelerators.)\nHere I will assume Planck scale qg, and look at some dimensional analysis to give a\nfeel for the phenomena. First, how should we think of the Planck scale? The Hilbert5\n\n\fR\nEinstein action is SHE = (~/16\u03c0L2P ) d4 x|g|1/2 R. For a spacetime region with radius\nof curvature L and 4-volume L4 the action is \u223c ~(L/LP )2 . This suggests that quantum\n< LP are unsuppressed.\ncurvature fluctuations with radius less than the Planck length L \u223c\nAnother way to view the significance of the Planck length is as the minimum localization length \u2206x, in the sense that if \u2206x < LP a black hole swallows the \u2206x. To\n> ~/\u2206x which\nsee this, note that the uncertainty relation \u2206x\u2206p \u2265 ~/2 implies \u2206p \u223c\n> ~c/\u2206x. Associated with this uncertain energy is a Schwarzschild raimplies \u2206E \u223c\ndius Rs (\u2206x) = 2G\u2206M/c2 = 2G\u2206E/c4 , hence quantum mechanics and gravity imply\n> L2P /\u2206x. The uncertain Rs (\u2206x) is less than \u2206x only if \u2206x > LP .\nRs (\u2206x) \u223c\n\u223c\n\n2.2\n\nHawking effect\n\nBefore Hawking, spherically symmetric, static black holes were assumed to be completely\ninert. In fact, it seems more natural that they can decay, since there is no conservation\nlaw preventing that. The decay is quantum mechanical, and thermal: Hawking found\nthat a black hole radiates at a temperature proportional to ~, TH = (~/2\u03c0)\u03ba, where \u03ba\nis the surface gravity. The fact that the radiation is thermal is even natural, for what\nelse could it be? The very nature of the horizon is a causal barrier to information, and\nyet the Hawking radiation emerges from just outside the horizon. Hence there can be\nno information in the Hawking radiation, save for the mass of the black hole which is\nvisible on the outside, so it must be a maximum entropy state, i.e. a thermal state with\na temperature determined by the black hole mass.\nFor a Schwarzschild black hole \u03ba = 1/4GM = 1/2Rs , so the Hawking temperature\nis inversely proportional to the mass. This implies a thermal wavelength \u03bbH = 8\u03c0 2 Rs , a\npurely geometrical relationship which indicates two things. First, although the emission\nprocess involves quantum mechanics, its \"kinematics\" is somehow classical. Second,\nas long as the Schwarzschild radius is much longer than the Planck length, it should\nbe possible to understand the Hawking effect using only qftcs, i.e. semi-classical qg.\n(Actually one must also require that the back-reaction is small, in the sense that the\nchange in the Hawking temperature due to the emission of a single Hawking quantum\nis small. This fails to hold for for a very nearly extremal black hole[17].)\nA Planck mass (\u223c 10\u22125 gm) black hole-if it could be treated semi-classically-\nwould have a Schwarzschild radius of order the Planck length (\u223c 10\u221233 cm) and a\nHawking temperature of order the Planck energy (\u223c 1019 GeV). From this the Hawking\ntemperatures for other black holes can be found by scaling. A solar mass black hole\nhas a Schwarzschild radius Rs \u223c 3 km hence a Hawking temperature \u223c 10\u221238 times\n6\n\n\fsmaller than the Planck energy, i.e. 10\u221219 GeV. Evaluated more carefully it works out\nto TH \u223c 10\u22127 K. For a mini black hole of mass M = 1015 gm one has Rs \u223c 10\u221213 cm\nand TH \u223c 1011 K \u223c 10 MeV.\nThe \"back reaction\", i.e. the response of the spacetime metric to the Hawking\nprocess, should be well approximated by the semi-classical Einstein equation G\u03bc\u03bd =\n8\u03c0GhT\u03bc\u03bd i provided it is a small effect. To assess the size, we can compare the stress\ntensor to the background curvature near the horizon (not to G\u03bc\u03bd , since that vanishes in\nthe background). The background Riemann tensor components are \u223c 1/Rs2 (in suitable\nfreely falling reference frame), while for example the energy density is \u223c TH4 /~3 \u223c ~/Rs4 .\nHence GhT\u03bc\u03bd i \u223c ~G/Rs4 = (LP /Rs )2 Rs\u22122 , which is much less than the background\ncurvature provided Rs \u226b LP , i.e. provided the black hole is large compared to the\nPlanck length.\nAlthough a tiny effect for astrophysical black holes, the Hawking process has a profound implication: black holes can \"evaporate\". How long does one take to evaporate? It\nemits roughly one Hawking quantum per light crossing time, hence dM/dt \u223c TH /RS \u223c\n~/RS2 \u223c ~/G2 M 2 . In Planck units ~ = c = G = 1, we have dM/dt \u223c M \u22122 . Integration yields the lifetime \u223c M 3 \u223c (Rs /LP )2 RS . For the 1015 gm, 10\u221213 cm black hole\nmentioned earlier we have (1020 )2 10\u221213 cm = 1027 cm, which is the age of the universe.\nHence a black hole of that mass in the early universe would be explosively ending its\nlife now. These are called \"primordial black holes\" (pbh's). None have been knowingly\nobserved so far, nor their detritus, which puts limits on the present density of pbh's (see\nfor example the references in[18]). However, it has been suggested[18] that they might\nnevertheless be the source of the highest energy (\u223c 3 \u00d7 1020 eV) cosmic rays. Note that\neven if pbh's were copiously produced in the early universe, their initial number density\ncould easily have been inflated away if they formed before inflation.\n\n2.3\n\nBlack hole entropy\n\nHow about the black hole entropy? The thermodynamic relation dM = TH dS =\n(~/8\u03c0GM)dS (for a black hole with no angular momentum or charge) implies SBH =\n4\u03c0GM 2 /~ = AH /4L2P , where AH = 4\u03c0RS2 is the black hole horizon area. What is this\nhuge entropy? What microstates does it count?\nWhatever the microstates may be, SBH is the lower bound for the entropy emitted\nto the outside world as the black hole evaporates, i.e. the minimal missing information\nbrought about by the presence of the black hole. By sending energy into a black hole\none could make it last forever, emitting an arbitrarily large amount of entropy, so it\n7\n\n\fonly makes sense to talk about the minimal entropy. This lower bound is attained when\nthe black hole evaporates reversibly into a thermal bath at a temperature infinitesimally\nbelow TH . (Evaporation into vacuum is irreversible, so the total entropy of the outside\nincreases even more[19], Semitted \u223c (4/3)SBH .) This amounts to a huge entropy increase.\nThe only way out of this conclusion would be if the semi-classical analysis breaks down\nfor some reason...which is suspected by many, not including me.\nThe so-called \"information paradox\" refers to the loss of information associated with\nthis entropy increase when a black hole evaporates, as well as to the loss of any other\ninformation that falls into the black hole. I consider it no paradox at all, but many\nthink it is a problem to be avoided at all costs. I think this viewpoint results from\nmissing the strongly non-perturbative role of quantum gravity in evolving the spacetime\ninto and beyond the classically singular region, whether by generating baby universes or\notherwise (see section 6.3.12 for more discussion of this point). Unfortunately it appears\nunlikely that semi-classical qg can \"prove\" that information is or is not lost, though\npeople have tried hard. For it not to be lost there would have to be subtle effects not\ncaptured by semi-classical qg, yet in a regime where semi-classical description \"should\"\nbe the whole story at leading order.\n\n3\n\nHarmonic oscillator\n\nOne can study a lot of interesting issues with free fields in curved spacetime, and I will\nrestrict entirely to that case except for a brief discussion. Free fields in curved spacetime\nare similar to collections of harmonic oscillators with time-dependent frequencies. I will\ntherefore begin by developing the properties of a one-dimensional quantum harmonic\noscillator in a formalism parallel to that used in quantum field theory.\nThe action for a particle of mass m moving in a time dependent potential V (x, t) in\none dimension takes the form\nZ\n1\n(3.1)\nS = dt L\nL = m\u1e8b2 \u2212 V (x, t)\n2\nfrom which follows the equation of motion m\u1e8d = \u2212\u2202x V (x, t). Canonical quantization\nproceeds by (i) defining the momentum conjugate to x, p = \u2202L/\u2202 \u1e8b = m\u1e8b, (ii) replacing\nx and p by operators x\u0302 and p\u0302, and (iii) imposing the canonical commutation relations\n[x\u0302, p\u0302] = i~. The operators are represented as hermitian linear operators on a Hilbert\nspace, the hermiticity ensuring that their spectrum is real as befits a quantity whose\n\n8\n\n\fclassical correspondent is a real number.1 In the Schr\u00f6dinger picture the state is timedependent, and the operators are time-independent. In the position representation for\nexample the momentum operator is given by p\u0302 = \u2212i~\u2202x . In the Heisenberg picture the\nstate is time-independent while the operators are time-dependent. The commutation\nrelation then should hold at each time, but this is still really only one commutation\nrelation since the the equation of motion implies that if it holds at one initial time it\nwill hold at all times. In terms of the position and velocity, the commutation relation(s)\nin the Heisenberg picture take the form\n[x(t), \u1e8b(t)] = i~/m.\n\n(3.2)\n\nHere and from here on the hats distinguishing numbers from operators are dropped.\nSpecializing now to a harmonic oscillator potential V (x, t) = 21 m\u03c9 2 (t)x2 the equation\nof motion takes the form\n\u1e8d + \u03c9 2 (t)x = 0.\n(3.3)\nConsider now any operator solution x(t) to this equation. Since the equation is second\norder the solution is determined by the two hermitian operators x(0) and \u1e8b(0), and since\nthe equation is linear the solution is linear in these operators. It is convenient to trade\nthe pair x(0) and \u1e8b(0) for a single time-independent non-hermitian operator a, in terms\nof which the solution is written as\nx(t) = f (t)a + f \u0304(t)a\u2020 ,\n\n(3.4)\n\nwhere f (t) is a complex function satisfying the classical equation of motion,\nf \u0308 + \u03c9 2 (t)f = 0,\n\n(3.5)\n\nf \u0304 is the complex conjugate of f , and a\u2020 is the hermitian conjugate of a. The commutation\nrelations (3.2) take the form\nhf, f i [a, a\u2020 ] = 1,\n(3.6)\nwhere the bracket notation is defined by\n\n1\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n \u0304\n \u0304\nhf, gi = (im/~) f \u2202t g \u2212 (\u2202t f )g .\n\n(3.7)\n\nIn a more abstract algebraic approach, one does not require at this stage a representation but\nrather requires that the quantum variables are elements of an algebra equipped with a star operation\nsatisfying certain axioms. For quantum mechanics the algebraic approach is no different from the\nconcrete representation approach, however for quantum fields the more general algebraic approach\nturns out to be necessary to have sufficient generality. In these lectures I will ignore this distinction.\nFor an introduction to the algebraic approach in the context of quantum fields in curved spacetime see\n[6]. For a comprehensive treatment of the algebraic approach to quantum field theory see [20].\n\n9\n\n\fIf the functions f and g are solutions to the harmonic oscillator equation (3.5), then\nthe bracket (3.7) is independent of the time t at which the right hand side is evaluated,\nwhich is consistent with the assumed time independence of a.\nLet us now assume that the solution f is chosen so that the real number hf, f i is\npositive. Then by rescaling f we can arrange to have\nhf, f i = 1.\n\n(3.8)\n\nIn this case the commutation relation (3.6) becomes\n[a, a\u2020 ] = 1,\n\n(3.9)\n\nthe standard relation for the harmonic oscillator raising and lowering operators. Using\nthe bracket with the operator x we can pluck out the raising and lowering operators\nfrom the position operator,\na\u2020 = \u2212hf \u0304, xi.\n\na = hf, xi,\n\n(3.10)\n\nSince both f and x satisfy the equation of motion, the brackets in (3.10) are time\nindependent as they must be.\nA Hilbert space representation of the operators can be built by introducing a state\n|0i \u221a\ndefined to be normalized and satisfying a|0i = 0. For each n, the state |ni =\n(1/ n!)(a\u2020 )n |0i is a normalized eigenstate of the number operator N = a\u2020 a with eigenvalue n. The span of all these states defines a Hilbert space of \"excitations\" above the\nstate |0i.\nSo far the solution f (t) is arbitrary, except for the normalization condition (3.8).\nA change in f (t) could be accompanied by a change in a that keeps the solution x(t)\nunchanged. In the special case of a constant frequency \u03c9(t) = \u03c9 however, the energy is\nconserved, and a special choice of f (t) is selected if we require that the state |0i be the\nground state of the Hamiltonian. Let us see how this comes about.\nFor a general f we have\n+ 12 m\u03c9 2 x2\n(3.11)\nh\ni\n \u0307 2 + \u03c9 2 |f |2 )(aa\u2020 + a\u2020 a) .(3.12)\n= 21 m (f \u03072 + \u03c9 2 f 2 )aa + (f \u03072 + \u03c9 2 f 2 )\u2217 a\u2020 a\u2020 + (|f|\n\nH =\n\nThus\n\n1\nm\u1e8b2\n2\n\n \u0307 2 + \u03c9 2|f |2 )|0i,\nH|0i = 21 m(f \u03072 + \u03c9 2 f 2 )\u2217 a\u2020 a\u2020 |0i + (|f|\n10\n\n(3.13)\n\n\fwhere the commutation relation (3.9) was used in the last term. If |0i is to be an\neigenstate of H, the first term must vanish, which requires\nf \u0307 = \u00b1i\u03c9f.\n\n(3.14)\n\nFor such an f the norm is\n\n2m\u03c9 2\n|f | ,\n(3.15)\n~\nhence the positivity of the normalization condition (3.8) selects from (3.14) the minus\nsign. This yields what is called the normalized positive frequency solution to the equation\nof motion, defined by\nr\n~ \u2212i\u03c9t\ne\n(3.16)\nf (t) =\n2m\u03c9\nup to an arbitrary constant phase factor.\nWith f given by (3.16) the Hamiltonian (3.12) becomes\nhf, f i = \u2213\n\nH =\n\n1\n~\u03c9(aa\u2020\n2\n\n+ a\u2020 a)\n\n= ~\u03c9(N + 21 ),\n\n(3.17)\n(3.18)\n\nwhere the commutation relation (3.9) was used in the last step. The spectrum of the\nnumber operator is the non-negative integers, hence the minimum energy state is the\none with N = 0, and \"zero-point energy\" ~\u03c9/2. This is just the state |0i annihilated by\na as defined above. If any function other than (3.16) is chosen to expand the position\noperator as in (3.4), the state annihilated by a is not the ground state of the oscillator.\nNote that although the mean value of the position is zero in the ground state, the\nmean of its square is\nh0|x2 |0i = ~/2m\u03c9.\n(3.19)\nThis characterizes the \"zero-point fluctuations\" of the position in the ground state.\n\n4\n\nQuantum scalar field in curved spacetime\n\nMuch of interest can be done with a scalar field, so it suffices for an introduction.\nThe basic concepts and methods extend straightforwardly to tensor and spinor fields.\nTo being with let's take a spacetime of arbitrary dimension D, with a metric g\u03bc\u03bd of\nsignature (+ \u2212 * * * \u2212). The action for the scalar field \u03c6 is\nZ\np 1\n\u0001\n(4.1)\nS = dD x |g| g \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202\u03bd \u03c6 \u2212 (m2 + \u03beR)\u03c62 ,\n2\n11\n\n\ffor which the equation of motion is\n\u0001\n\u0003 + m2 + \u03beR \u03c6 = 0,\n\n\u0003 = |g|\u22121/2 \u2202\u03bc |g|1/2g \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bd .\n\n(4.2)\n\n(With ~ explicit, the mass m should be replaced by m/~, however we'll leave ~ implicit\nhere.) The case where the coupling \u03be to the Ricci scalar R vanishes is referred to as\n\"minimal coupling\", and that equation is called the Klein-Gordon (KG) equation. If\nalso the mass m vanishes it is called the \"massless, minimally coupled scalar\". Another\nspecial case of interest is \"conformal coupling\" with m = 0 and \u03be = (D \u2212 2)/4(D \u2212 1).\n\n4.1\n\nConformal coupling\n\nLet me pause briefly to explain the meaning of conformal coupling since it comes up\noften in discussions of quantum fields in curved spacetime, primarily either because\nRobertson-Walker metrics are conformally flat or because all two-dimensional metrics\nare conformally flat. Consider making a position dependent conformal transformation\nof the metric:\ng\u03bc\u03bd = \u03a92 (x)g\u03bc\u03bd ,\ne\n(4.3)\n\nwhich induces the changes\nge\u03bc\u03bd = \u03a9\u22122 (x)g \u03bc\u03bd ,\n\ne = ge\u03bc\u03bd R\ne\u03bc\u03bd\nR\n\n|e\ng |1/2 = \u03a9D (x)|g|1/2,\n\n|e\ng |1/2 e\ng \u03bc\u03bd = \u03a9D\u22122 (x)|g|1/2 g \u03bc\u03bd ,\n(4.4)\n\u0010\n\u0011\n= \u03a9\u22122 R \u2212 2(D \u2212 1)\u0003 ln \u03a9 \u2212 (D \u2212 1)(D \u2212 2)g \u03b1\u03b2 (ln \u03a9),\u03b1 (ln \u03a9),\u03b2 . (4.5)\n\nIn D = 2 dimensions, the action is simply invariant in the massless, minimally coupled\ncase without any change of the scalar field: S[\u03c6, g] = S[\u03c6, e\ng ]. In any other dimension,\nthe kinetic term is invariant under a conformal transformation with a constant \u03a9 if we accompany the metric change (4.3) with a change of the scalar field, \u03c6\ne = \u03a9(2\u2212D)/2 \u03c6. (This\nscaling relation corresponds to the fact that the scalar field has dimension [length](2\u2212D)/2\nsince the action must be dimensionless after factoring out an overall ~.) For a nonconstant \u03a9 the derivatives in the kinetic term ruin the invariance in general. However\nit can be shown that the action is invariant (up to a boundary term) if the coupling\nconstant \u03be is chosen to have the special value given in the previous paragraph, i.e.\nS[\u03c6, g] = S[\u03c6,\ne e\ng ]. In D = 4 dimensions that value is \u03be = 1/6.\n\n12\n\n\f4.2\n\nCanonical quantization\n\nTo canonically quantize we first pass to the Hamiltonian description. Separating out a\ntime coordinate x0 , x\u03bc = (x0 , xi ), we can write the action as\nZ\nZ\n0\nS = dx L,\nL = dD\u22121 x L.\n(4.6)\nThe canonical momentum at a time x0 is given by\n\u03b4L\n\u0011 = |g|1/2g \u03bc0 \u2202\u03bc \u03c6(x) = |h|1/2 n\u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03c6(x).\n\u03c0(x) = \u0010\n\u03b4 \u22020 \u03c6(x)\n\n(4.7)\n\nHere x labels a point on a surface of constant x0 , the x0 argument of \u03c6 is suppressed,\nn\u03bc is the unit normal to the surface, and h is the determinant of the induced spatial\nmetric hij . To quantize, the field \u03c6 and its conjugate momentum \u03c6 are now promoted\nto hermitian operators2 and required to satisfy the canonical commutation relation,\n[\u03c6(x), \u03c0(y)] = i~\u03b4 D\u22121 (x, y)\n\n(4.8)\n\nIt is worth noting that, being a variational derivative, the conjugate momentum is a\ndensity of weight one, and hence the Dirac delta function on the right hand side of\n(4.8) is a density of weight one in the second argument. It is defined by the property\nR D\u22121 D\u22121\nd\ny \u03b4\n(x, y)f (y) = f (x) for any scalar function f , without the use of a metric\nvolume element.\nIn analogy with the bracket (3.7) defined for the case of the harmonic oscillator, one\ncan form a conserved bracket from two complex solutions to the scalar wave equation\n(4.2),\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n1/2 \u03bc\u03bd\nhf, gi =\nd\u03a3\u03bc j ,\nj (f, g) = (i/~)|g| g f \u2202\u03bd g \u2212 (\u2202\u03bd f )g .\n(4.9)\n\u03a3\n\nThis bracket is sometimes called the Klein-Gordon inner product, and hf, f i the KleinGordon norm of f . The current density j \u03bc (f, g) is divergenceless (\u2202\u03bc j \u03bc = 0) when the\nfunctions f and g satisfy the KG equation (4.2), hence the value of the integral in (4.9) is\nindependent of the spacelike surface \u03a3 over which it is evaluated, provided the functions\nvanish at spatial infinity. The KG inner product satisfies the relations\nhf, gi = \u2212hf , gi = hg, f i,\nNote that it is not positive definite.\n2\n\nSee footnote 1.\n\n13\n\nhf, fi = 0\n\n(4.10)\n\n\f4.3\n\nHilbert space\n\nAt this point it is common to expand the field operator in modes and to associate\nannihilation and creation operators with modes, in close analogy with the harmonic\noscillator (3.4), however instead I will begin with individual wave packet solutions. My\nreason is that in some situations there is no particularly natural set of modes, and none is\nneeded to make physical predictions from the theory. (An illustration of this statement\nwill be given in our treatment of the Hawking effect.) A mode decomposition is a basis\nin the space of solutions, and has no fundamental status.\nIn analogy with the harmonic oscillator case (3.10), we define the annihilation operator associated with a complex classical solution f by the bracket of f with the field\noperator \u03c6:\na(f ) = hf, \u03c6i\n(4.11)\nSince both f and \u03c6 satisfy the wave equation, a(f ) is well-defined, independent of the\nsurface on which the bracket integral is evaluated. It follows from the above definition\nand the hermiticity of \u03c6 that the hermitian conjugate of a(f ) is given by\na\u2020 (f ) = \u2212a(f ).\n\n(4.12)\n\nThe canonical commutation relation (4.8) together with the definition of the momentum\n(4.7) imply that\n[a(f ), a\u2020 (g)] = hf, gi.\n(4.13)\nThe converse is also true, in the sense that if (4.13) holds for all solutions f and g,\nthen the canonical commutation relation holds. Using (4.12), we immediately obtain\nthe similar relations\n[a\u2020 (f ), a\u2020 (g)] = \u2212hf , gi\n\n[a(f ), a(g)] = \u2212hf, gi,\n\n(4.14)\n\nIf f is a positive norm solution with unit norm hf, f i = 1, then a(f ) and a\u2020 (f ) satisfy\nthe usual commutation relation for the raising and lowering operators for a harmonic\noscillator, [a(f ), a\u2020 (f )] = 1. Suppose now that |\u03a8i is a normalized quantum state satisfying a(f )|\u03a8i = 0. Of course this condition does not specify the state,\u221abut rather only\none aspect of the state. Nevertheless, for each n, the state |n, \u03a8i = (1/ n!)(a\u2020 (f ))n |\u03a8i\nis a normalized eigenstate of the number operator N(f ) = a\u2020 (f )a(f ) with eigenvalue n.\nThe span of all these states defines a Fock space of f -wavepacket \"n-particle excitations\"\nabove the state |\u03a8i.\nIf we want to construct the full Hilbert space of the field theory, how can we proceed?\nWe should find a decomposition of the space of complex solutions to the wave equation\n14\n\n\fS into a direct sum of a positive norm subspace Sp and its complex conjugate Sp , such\nthat all brackets between solutions from the two subspaces vanish. That is, we must\nfind a direct sum decomposition\n(4.15)\nS = Sp \u2295 Sp\nsuch that\nhf, f i > 0\n\n\u2200f \u2208 Sp\n\nhf, gi = 0\n\n\u2200f, g \u2208 Sp .\n\n(4.16)\n(4.17)\n\nThe first condition implies that each f in Sp can be scaled to define its own harmonic\noscillator sub-albegra as in the previous paragraph. The second condition implies, according to (4.14), that the annihilators and creators for f and g in the subspace Sp\ncommute amongst themselves: [a(f ), a(g)] = 0 = [a\u2020 (f ), a\u2020 (g)].\nGiven such a decompostion a total Hilbert space for the field theory can be defined as the space of finite norm sums of possibly infinitely many states of the form\na\u2020 (f1 ) * * * a\u2020 (fn )|0i, where |0i is a state such that a(f )|0i = 0 for all f in Sp , and all\nf1 , . . . , fn are in Sp . The state |0i is called a Fock vacuum. It depends on the decomposition (4.15), and in general is not the ground state (which is not even well defined\nunless the background metric is globally static). The representation of the field operator\non this Fock space is hermitian and satisfies the canonical commutation relations.\n\n4.4\n\nFlat spacetime\n\nNow let's apply the above generalities to the case of a massive scalar field in flat spacetime. In this setting a natural decomposition of the space of solutions is defined by\npositive and negative frequency with respect to a Minkowski time translation, and the\ncorresponding Fock vacuum is the ground state. I summarize briefly since this is standard flat spacetime quantum field theory.\nBecause of the infinite volume of space, plane wave solutions are of course not normalizable. To keep the physics straight and the language simple it is helpful to introduce\nperiodic boundary conditions, so that space becomes a large three-dimensional torus with\ncircumferences L and volume V = L3 . The allowed wave vectors are then k = (2\u03c0/L)n,\nwhere the components of the vector n are integers. In the end we can always take the\nlimit L \u2192 \u221e to obtain results for local quantities that are insensitive to this formal\ncompactification.\n\n15\n\n\fA complete set of solutions (\"modes\") to the classical wave equation (4.2) with \u0003\nthe flat space d'Alembertian and R = 0 is given by\ns\n~\ne\u2212i\u03c9(k)t eik*x\n(4.18)\nfk (t, x) =\n2V \u03c9(k)\nwhere\n\u03c9(k) =\n\n\u221a\n\nk2 + m2 ,\n\n(4.19)\n\ntogether with the solutions obtained by replacing the positive frequency \u03c9(k) by its\nnegative, \u2212\u03c9(k). The brackets between these solutions satisfy\nhfk , fl i = \u03b4k,l\n\n(4.20)\n\nhfk , fl i = 0,\n\n(4.22)\n\nhf k , f l i = \u2212\u03b4k,l\n\n(4.21)\n\nso they provide an orthogonal decomposition of the solution space into positive norm\nsolutions and their conjugates as in (4.17), with Sp the space spanned by the positive\nfrequency modes fk . As described in the previous subsection this provides a Fock space\nrepresentation.\nIf we define the annihilation operator associated to fk by\nak = hfk , \u03c6i,\nthen the field operator has the expansion\n\u0011\nX \u0010\n\u03c6=\nfk ak + f k a\u2020k .\n\n(4.23)\n\n(4.24)\n\nk\n\nSince the individual solutions fk have positive frequency, and the Hamiltonian is a sum\nover the contributions from each k value, our previous discussion of the single oscillator\nshows that the vacuum state defined by\nak |0i = 0\n\n(4.25)\n\nfor all k is in fact the ground state of the Hamiltonian. The states\na\u2020k |0i\n\n(4.26)\n\nhave momentum ~k and energy ~\u03c9(k), and are interpreted as single particle states.\nStates of the form a\u2020k1 * * * a\u2020kn |0i are interpreted as n-particle states.\n16\n\n\fNote that although the field Fourier component \u03c6k = fk ak + f \u2212k a\u2020\u2212k has zero\nmean in the vacuum state, like the harmonic oscillator position it undergoes \"zero-point\nfluctuations\" characterized by\n~\n,\n(4.27)\nh0|\u03c6\u2020k \u03c6k |0i = |f\u2212k |2 =\n2V \u03c9(k)\nwhich is entirely analogous to the oscillator result (3.19).\n\n4.5\n\nCurved spacetime, \"particles\", and stress tensor\n\nIn a general curved spacetime setting there is no analog of the preferred Minkowski\nvacuum and definition of particle states. However, it is clear that we can import these\nnotions locally in an approximate sense if the wavevector and frequency are high enough\ncompared to the inverse radius of curvature. Slightly more precisely, we can expand the\nmetric in Riemann normal coordinates about any point x0 :\n1\n(4.28)\ng\u03bc\u03bd (x) = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd + R\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 (x0 )(x \u2212 x0 )\u03b1 (x \u2212 x0 )\u03b2 + O((x \u2212 x0 )3 ).\n3\nIf k2 and \u03c9 2 (k) are much larger than any component of the Riemann tensor R\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 (x0 )\nin this coordinate system then it is clear that the flat space interpretation of the corresponding part of Fock space will hold to a good approximation, and in particular a\nparticle detector will respond to the Fock states as it would in flat spacetime. This\nnotion is useful at high enough wave vectors locally in any spacetime, and for essentially\nall wave vectors asymptotically in spacetimes that are asymptotically flat in the past or\nthe future or both.\nMore generally, however, the notion of a \"particle\" is ambiguous in curved spacetime, and one should use field observables to characterize states. One such observable\ndetermines how a \"particle detector\" coupled to the field would respond were it following\nsome particular worldline in spacetime and the coupling were adiabatically turned on\nand off at prescribed times. For example the transition probability of a point monopole\ndetector is determined in lowest order perturbation theory by the two-point function\nh\u03a8|\u03c6(x)\u03c6(x\u2032 )|\u03a8i evaluated along the worldline[21, 11] of the detector. (For a careful\ndiscussion of the regularization required in the case of a point detector see [22].) Alternatively this quantity-along with the higher order correlation functions-is itself a\nprobe of the state of the field.\nAnother example of a field observable is the expectation value of the stress energy\ntensor, which is the source term in the semi-classical Einstein equation\nG\u03bc\u03bd = 8\u03c0Gh\u03a8|T\u03bc\u03bd (x)|\u03a8i.\n17\n\n(4.29)\n\n\fThis quantity is infinite because it contains the product of field operators at the same\npoint. Physically, the infinity is due to the fluctuations of the infinitely many ultraviolet\nfield modes. For example, the leading order divergence of the energy density can be\nattributed to the zero-point energy of the field fluctuations, but there are subleading\ndivergences as well. We have no time here to properly go into this subject, but rather\nsettle for a few brief comments.\nOne way to make sense of the expectation value is via the difference between its\nvalues in two different states. This difference is well-defined (with a suitable regulator)\nand finite for any two states sharing the same singular short distance behavior. The\nresult depends of course upon the comparison state. Since the divergence is associated\nwith the very short wavelength modes, it might seem that to uniquely define the expectation value at a point x it should suffice to just subtract the infinities for a state\ndefined as the vacuum in the local flat spacetime approximation at x. This subtraction\nis ambiguous however, even after making it as local as possible and ensuring local conservation of energy (\u2207\u03bc hT\u03bc\u03bd i = 0). It defines the expectation value only up to a tensor\nH\u03bc\u03bd constructed locally from the background metric with four or fewer derivatives and\nsatisfying the identity \u2207\u03bc H\u03bc\u03bd = 0. The general such tensor is the variation with respect\nto the metric of the invariant functional\nZ\n\u0011\np \u0010\n2\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3\nD\nR\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 .\n(4.30)\nd x |g| c0 + c1 R + c2 R + c3 R R\u03bc\u03bd + c4 R\n\n(In four spacetime dimensions the last term can be rewritten as a combination of the\nfirst two and a total divergence.) Thus H\u03bc\u03bd is a combination of g\u03bc\u03bd , the Einstein tensor\nG\u03bc\u03bd , and curvature squared terms. In effect, the ambiguity \u2212H\u03bc\u03bd is added to the metric\nside of the semi-classical field equation, where it renormalizes the cosmological constant\nand Newton's constant, and introduces curvature squared terms.\nA different approach is to define the expectation value of the stress tensor via the\nmetric variation of the renormalized effective action, which posesses ambiguities of the\nsame form as (4.30). Hence the two approaches agree.\n\n4.6\n4.6.1\n\nRemarks\nContinuum normalization of modes\n\nInstead of the \"box normalization\" used above we could \"normalize\" the solutions fk\n(4.18) with the factor V \u22121/2 replaced by (2\u03c0)\u22123/2 . Then the Kronecker \u03b4's in (4.20, 4.21)\nwould be replaced by Dirac \u03b4-functions and the discrete sum over momenta in (4.24)\n18\n\n\fwould be an integral over k. In this case the annihilation and creation operators would\nsatisfy [ak , a\u2020l ] = \u03b4 3 (k, l).\n4.6.2\n\nMassless minimally coupled zero mode\n\nThe massless minimally coupled case m = 0, \u03be = 0 has a peculiar feature. The spatially\nconstant function f (t, x) = c0 +c1 t is a solution to the wave equation that is not included\namong the positive frequency solutions fk or their conjugates. This \"zero mode\" must\nbe quantized as well, but it behaves like a free particle rather than like a harmonic\noscillator. In particular, the state of lowest energy would have vanishing conjugate field\nmomentum and hence would be described by a Schr\u00f6dinger wave function \u03c8(\u03c60 ) that\nis totally delocalized in the field amplitude \u03c60 . Such a wave function would be nonnormalizable as a quantum state, just as any momentum eigenstate of a non-relativistic\nparticle is non-normalizable. Any normalized state would be described by a Schr\u00f6dinger\nwavepacket that would spread in \u03c60 like a free particle spreads in position space, and\nwould have an expectation value h\u03c60 i growing linearly in time. This suggests that no\ntime-independent state exists. That is indeed true in the case where the spatial directions\nare compactified on a torus for example, so that the modes are discrete and the zero\nmode carries as much weight as any other mode. In non-compact space one must look\nmore closely. It turns out that in 1 + 1 dimensions the zero mode continues to preclude a\ntime independent state (see e.g. [23], although the connection to the behavior of the zero\nmode is not made there), however in higher dimensions it does not, presumably because\nof the extra factors of k in the measure k D\u22122 dk. A version of the same issue arises\nin deSitter space, where no deSitter invariant state exists for the massless, minimally\ncoupled field [24]. That is true in higher dimensions as well, however, which may be\nrelated to the fact that the spatial sections of deSitter space are compact.\n\n5\n\nParticle creation\n\nWe turn now to the subject of particle creation in curved spacetime (which would more\nappropriately be called \"field excitation\", but we use the standard term). The main\napplications are to the case of expanding cosmological spacetimes and to the Hawking\neffect for black holes. To begin with I will discuss the analogous effect for a single harmonic oscillator, which already contains the essential elements of the more complicated\ncases. The results will then be carried over to the cosmological setting. The following\nsection then takes up the subject of the Hawking effect.\n19\n\n\f5.1\n\nParametric excitation of a harmonic oscillator\n\nA quantum field in a time-dependent background spacetime can be modeled in a simple\nway by a harmonic oscillator whose frequency \u03c9(t) is a given function of time. The\nequation of motion is then (3),\n\u1e8d + \u03c9 2 (t) x = 0.\n(5.1)\nWe consider the situation where the frequency is asymptotically constant, approaching\n\u03c9in in the past and \u03c9out in the future. The question to be answered is this: if the\noscillator starts out in the ground state |0in i appropriate to \u03c9in as t \u2192 \u2212\u221e, what is the\nstate as t \u2192 +\u221e? More precisely, in the Heisenberg picture the state does not evolve,\nso what we are really asking is how is the state |0in i expressed as a Fock state in the\nout-Hilbert space appropriate to \u03c9out ? It is evidently not the same as the ground state\n|0out i of the Hamiltonian in the asymptotic future.\nTo answer this question we need only relate the annihilation and creation operators\nassociated with the in and out normalized positive frequency modes f in (t), which are\nout\nsolutions to (5.1) with the asymptotic behavior\ns\n~\nt\u2192\u2213\u221e\nexp(\u2212i\u03c9 in t).\n(5.2)\nf in (t) \u2212\u2192\nout\nout\n2m\u03c9 in\nout\n\nSince the equation of motion is second order in time derivatives it admits a two-parameter\nfamily of solutions, hence there must exist complex constants \u03b1 and \u03b2 such that\nfout = \u03b1fin + \u03b2 f \u0304in .\n\n(5.3)\n\nThe normalization condition hfout , fout i = 1 implies that\n|\u03b1|2 \u2212 |\u03b2|2 = 1.\n\n(5.4)\n\nThe out annihilation operator is given (see (3.10)) by\naout = hfout , xi\n\n= h\u03b1fin + \u03b2 f \u0304in , xi\n= \u03b1ain \u2212 \u03b2\u0304a\u2020in .\n\n(5.5)\n(5.6)\n(5.7)\n\nThis sort of linear relation between two sets of annihilation and creation operators (or the\ncorresponding solutions) is called a Bogoliubov transformation, and the coefficients are\n\n20\n\n\fthe Bogoliubov coefficients. The mean value of the out number operator Nout = a\u2020out aout\nis nonzero in the state |0in i:\nh0in |Nout |0in i = |\u03b2|2.\n(5.8)\nIn this sense the time dependence of \u03c9(t) excites the oscillator, and |\u03b2|2 characterizes\nthe excitation number.\nTo get a feel for the Bogoliubov coefficient \u03b2 let us consider two extreme cases,\nadiabatic and sudden.\n5.1.1\n\nAdiabatic transitions and ground state\n\nThe adiabatic case corresponds to a situation in which the frequency is changing very\nslowly compared to the period of oscillation,\n\u03c9\u0307\n\u226a \u03c9.\n\u03c9\n\n(5.9)\n\nIn this case there is almost no excitation, so |\u03b2| \u226a 1. Generically in the adiabatic case\nthe Bogoliubov coefficient is exponentially small, \u03b2 \u223c exp(\u2212\u03c90 T ), where \u03c90 is a typical\nfrequency and T characterizes the time scale for the variations in the frequency.\nIn the Schr\u00f6dinger picture, one can say that during an adiabatic change of \u03c9(t)\nthe state continually adjusts to remain close to the instantaneous adiabatic ground state.\nThis state at time t0 is the one annihilated by the lowering operator a(ft0 ) defined by the\nsolution ft0 (t) satisfying the initial conditions at t0 corresponding to the \"instantaneous\npositive frequency solution\",\np\n~/2m\u03c9(t0 )\n(5.10)\nft0 (t0 ) =\nf \u0307t (t0 ) = \u2212i\u03c9(t0 )ft (t0 ).\n(5.11)\n0\n\n0\n\nThe instantaneous adiabatic ground state is sometimes called the \"lowest order adiabatic\nground state at t0 \". One can also consider higher order adiabatic ground states as follows\nRt\n(see e.g. [3, 5]). A function of the WKB form (~/2mW (t))1/2 exp(\u2212i W (t\u2032 ) dt\u2032) is a\nnormalized solution to (5.1) provided W (t) satisfies a certain second order differential\nequation. That equation can be solved iteratively, yielding an expansion W (t) = \u03c9(t) +\n* * *, where the subsequent terms involve time derivatives of \u03c9(t). The lowest order\nadiabatic ground state at t0 is defined using the solution whose initial conditions (5.11)\nmatch the lowest order truncation of the expansion for W (t). A higher order adiabatic\nground state is similarly defined using a higher order truncation.\n\n21\n\n\f5.1.2\n\nSudden transitions\n\nThe opposite extreme is the sudden one, in which \u03c9 changes instantaneously from \u03c9in\nto \u03c9out at some time t0 . We can then find the Bogoliubov coefficients using (5.3) and its\nfirst derivative at t0 . For t0 = 0 the result is\n\u0012r\n\u0013\nr\n\u03c9in\n\u03c9out\n1\n(5.12)\n+\n\u03b1 =\n2\n\u03c9out\n\u03c9in\n\u0012r\n\u0013\nr\n1\n\u03c9in\n\u03c9out\n\u03b2 =\n\u2212\n.\n(5.13)\n2\n\u03c9out\n\u03c9in\n\n(For t0 6= 0 there are extra phase factors in these solutions.) Interestingly, the amount\nof excitation is precisely the same if the roles of \u03c9in and \u03c9out are interchanged. For an\nexample, consider the case where \u03c9out = 4\u03c9in , for which \u03b1 = 5/4 and \u03b2 = \u22123/4. In this\ncase the expectation value (5.8) of the out number operator is 9/16, so there is about\n\"half an excitation\".\n5.1.3\n\nRelation between in and out ground states & the squeeze operator\n\nThe expectation value of Nout is only one number characterizing the relation between\n|Oin i and the out states. We shall now determine the complete relation\nX\n|Oin i =\ncn |niout\n(5.14)\nn\n\nwhere the states |niout are eigenstates of Nout and the cn are constants.\nOne can find ain in terms of aout and a\u2020out by combining (5.3) with its complex\nconjugate to solve for fin in terms of fout and f \u0304out . In analogy with (5.7) one then finds\nain = \u03b1aout + \u03b2\u0304a\u2020out .\n\n(5.15)\n\nThus the defining condition ain |0in i = 0 implies\n\n\u03b2\u0304\naout |0in i = \u2212 a\u2020out |0in i.\n\u03b1\n\n(5.16)\n\nA transparent way to solve this is to note that the commutation relation [aout , a\u2020out ] = 1\nsuggests the formal analogy aout = \u2202/\u2202a\u2020out . This casts (5.16) as a first order ordinary\ndifferential equation, with solution\n\u0014 \u0012 \u0013\n\u0015\n\u03b2\u0304\n\u2020\n\u2020\n|0in i = N exp \u2212\n(5.17)\naout aout |0out i\n2\u03b1\n\u221a\nX 2n! \u0012 \u03b2\u0304 \u0013n\n\u2212\n|2niout .\n(5.18)\n= N\nn!\n2\u03b1\nn\n22\n\n\fNote that the state |0out i on which the exponential operator acts is annihilated by aout ,\nso there is no extra term from a\u2020out -dependence.\nThe state |0in i thus contains only even numbered excitations when expressed in terms\nof the out number eigenstates. The normalization constant N is given by\n|N |\u22122 =\n\nX 2n! \u03b2\u0304\n(n!)2 2\u03b1\nn\n\n2n\n\n.\n\n(5.19)\nn\n\nFor large n the summand approaches |\u03b2\u0304/\u03b1|2n = [|\u03b2|2 /(|\u03b2|2 + 1)] , where the relation\n(5.4) was used in the last step. The sum therefore converges, and can be evaluated3 to\nyield\n\u00111/4\n\u0010\n|N | = 1 \u2212 |\u03b2/\u03b1|2\n= |\u03b1|\u22121/2 .\n(5.20)\n\nAn alternate way of describing |0in i in the out Hilbert space is via the squeeze operator\nhz\nz\u0304 i\n\u2020 \u2020\n(5.21)\nS = exp a a \u2212 aa .\n2\n2\n\nSince its exponent is anti-hermitian, S is unitary. Conjugating a by S yields\nS \u2020 aS = cosh |z| a + sinh |z|\n\nz \u2020\na.\n|z|\n\n(5.22)\n\nThis has the form of the Bogoliubov transformation (5.15) with \u03b1 = cosh |z| and \u03b2 =\nsinh |z|(z/|z|). With aout in place of a in S this gives\nain = S \u2020 aout S.\n\n(5.23)\n\nThe condition ain |0in i = 0 thus implies aout S|0in i = 0, so evidently\n|0in i = S \u2020 |0out i\n\n(5.24)\n\nup to a constant phase factor. That is, the in and out ground states are related by the\naction of the squeeze operator S. Since S is unitary, the right hand side of (5.24) is\nmanifestly normalized.\n3\n\nAlex Maloney pointed\nevaluated by expressing the binomial coefficient 2n!/(n!)2\nH out that it can be\n2n\nas the contour integral (dz/2\u03c0iz)(z + 1/z) and interchanging the order of the sum with the integral.\n\n23\n\n\f5.2\n\nCosmological particle creation\n\nWe now apply the ideas just developed to a free scalar quantum field satisfying the KG\nequation (4.2) in a homogeneous isotropic spacetime. The case when the spatial sections\nare flat is slightly simpler, and it is already quite applicable, hence we restrict to that\ncase here.\nThe spatially flat Robertson-Walker (RW) line element takes the form:\nds2 = dt2 \u2212 a2 (t)dxi dxi = a2 (\u03b7)(d\u03b7 2 \u2212 dxi dxi )\n\n(5.25)\n\n\u0003 = \u2202t2 + (3\u0227/a)\u2202t \u2212 a\u22122 \u2202x2i ,\n\n(5.26)\n\nR\nIt is conformally flat, as are all RW metrics. The coordinate \u03b7 = dt/a(t) is called the\nconformal time, to distinguish it from the proper time t of the isotropic observers. The\nd'Alembertian \u0003 for this metric is given by\n\nwhere the dot stands for \u2202/\u2202t. The spatial translation symmetry allows the spatial\ndependence to be separated from the time dependence. A field\nuk (x, t) = \u03b6k (t)eik*x\n\n(5.27)\n\nsatisfies the field equation (4.2) provided \u03b6k (t) satisfies an equation similar to that of\na damped harmonic oscillator but with time-dependent damping coefficient 3\u0227/a and\ntime-dependent frequency a\u22122 k 2 + m2 + \u03beR. It is worth emphasizing that in spite of the\n\"damping\", the field equation is Hamiltonian, and the Klein-Gordon norm (4.9) of any\nsolution is conserved in the evolution.\nThe field equation can be put into the form of an undamped oscillator with timedependent frequency by using the conformal time \u03b7 instead of t and factoring out an\nappropriate power of the conformal factor a2 (\u03b7):\n\u03b6k = a\u22121 \u03c7k .\n\n(5.28)\n\nThe function uk satisfies the field equation if and only if\n\u03c7\u2032\u2032k + \u03c9 2(\u03b7)\u03c7k = 0,\n\n(5.29)\n\nwhere the prime stands for d/d\u03b7 and\n\u03c9 2(\u03b7) = k 2 + m2 a2 \u2212 (1 \u2212 6\u03be)(a\u2032\u2032/a).\n24\n\n(5.30)\n\n\f(In the special case of conformal coupling m = 0 and \u03be = 1/6, this becomes the timeindependent harmonic oscillator, so that case is just like flat spacetime. All effects of\nthe curvature are then incorporated by the prefactor a(\u03b7)\u22121 in (5.28).)\nThe uk are orthogonal in the Klein-Gordon inner product (4.9), and they are normalized4 provided the \u03c7k have unit norm:\nhuk , ul i = \u03b4k,l \u21d0\u21d2 (iV /~)(\u03c7\u0304k \u03c7\u2032k \u2212 \u03c7\u0304\u2032k \u03c7k ) = 1.\n\n(5.31)\n\nNote that the relevant norm for the \u03c7k differs from that for the harmonic oscillator\n(3.7) only by the replacement m \u2192 V , where V is the xi -coordinate volume of the\nconstant t surfaces. We also have huk , \u016bl i = 0 for all k, l, hence these modes provide\nan orthogonal postive/negative norm decomposition of the space of complex solutions.\nAs discussed in section 4.3, this yields a corresponding Fock space representation for\nthe field operators.

This solution is similar to the corresponding\nexpression (5.18) for the harmonic oscillator and it can be found by a similar method.\nAlthough the operators a\u2020k out and a\u2020\u2212k out are distinct, each product appears twice in\nthe sum, once for k and once for \u2212k, hence the factor of 2 in the denominator of the\nexponent is required. Using the two-mode analog of the squeeze operator (5.21) the\nstate (5.42) can also be written in a manifestly normalized fashion analogous to (5.24).\nIt is sometimes called a squeezed vacuum.\n26\n\n\f5.3\n5.3.1\n\nRemarks\nMomentum correlations in the squeezed vacuum\n\nThe state (5.42) can be expressed as a sum of terms each of which has equal numbers of\nk and \u2212k excitations. These degrees of freedom are thus entangled in the state, in such\na way as to ensure zero total momentum. This is required by translation invariance of\nthe states |0in i and |0out i, since momentum is the generator of space translations.\n5.3.2\n\nNormalization of the squeezed vacuum\n\nThe norm sum for the part of the state (5.42) involving k and \u2212k is a standard geometric\nseries, which evaluates to |\u03b1k |2 using (5.36). Hence to normalize the state one can set\nNk = |\u03b1k |\u22121/2 for all k, including k = 0 as in (5.20). The overall normalization factor\nis a product of infinitely many numbers less than unity. Unless those numbers converge\nrapidly enough to unity the state is not normalizable. The condition for normalizability\nP\nis easily seen to be k |\u03b2k |2 < \u221e, i.e. according to (5.37) the average total number\nof excitations must be finite. If it is not, the state |0in i does not lie in the Fock space\nbuilt on the the state |0out i. Note that, although formally unitary, the squeeze operator\ndoes not act unitarily on the out Fock space if the corresponding state is not in fact\nnormalizable.\n5.3.3\n\nEnergy density\n\nIf the scale factor a changes by over a time interval \u2206\u03c4 , then for a massless field dimensional analysis indicates that the in vacuum has a resulting energy density \u03c1 \u223c ~(\u2206\u03c4 )\u22124\nafter the change. To see how the formalism produces this, according to (5.39) we have\nR\n\u03c1 = (2\u03c0a)\u22123 d3 k|\u03b2k |2 (~\u03c9/a). The Bogoliubov coefficent \u03b2k is of order unity around\nkc /a \u223c 1/\u2206\u03c4 and decays exponentially above that. The integral is dominated by the\nupper limit and hence yields the above mentioned result.\n5.3.4\n\nAdiabatic vacuum\n\nModes with frequency much larger than a\u2032 /a see the change of the scale factor as adiabatic, hence they remain relatively unexcited. The state that corresponds to the instantaneously defined ground state, in analogy with (5.11) for the single harmonic oscillator,\nis called the adiabatic vacuum at a given time.\n\n27\n\n\f5.4\n\nde Sitter space\n\nThe special case of de Sitter space is of interest for various reasons. The first is just\nits high degree of symmetry, which makes it a convenient arena for the study of qft in\ncurved space. It is the maximally symmetric Lorentzian space with (constant) positive\ncurvature. Maximal symmetry refers to the number of Killing fields, which is the same\nas for flat spacetime. The Euclidean version of de Sitter space is just the sphere.\nde Sitter (dS) space has hypersurface-orthogonal timelike Killing fields, hence is locally static, which further simplifies matters, but not to the point of triviality. The reason\nis that all such Killing fields have Killing horizons, null surfaces to which they are tangent, and beyond which they are spacelike. Hence dS space serves as a highly symmetric\nanalog of a black hole spacetime. In particular, a symmetric variant of the Hawking\neffect takes place in de Sitter space, as first noticed by Gibbons and Hawking[25]. See\n[26] for a recent review.\nInflationary cosmology provides another important use of deSitter space, since during the period of exponential expansion the spacetime metric is well described by dS\nspace. In this application the dS line element is usually written using spatially flat RW\ncoordinates:\nds2 = dt2 \u2212 e2Ht dxi dxi .\n(5.43)\nThese coordinates cover only half of the global dS space, and they do not make the\nexistence of a time translation symmetry manifest. This takes the conformal form (5.25)\nwith \u03b7 = \u2212H \u22121 exp(\u2212Ht) and a(\u03b7) = \u22121/H\u03b7. The range of t is (\u2212\u221e, \u221e) while that of\n\u03b7 is (\u2212\u221e, 0).\nThe flat patch of de Sitter space is asymptotically static with respect to conformal\ntime \u03b7 in the past, since a\u2032 /a = \u22121/\u03b7 \u2192 0 as \u03b7 \u2192 \u2212\u221e. Therefore in the asymptotic\npast the adiabatic vacuum (with respect to positive \u03b7-frequency) defines a natural initial\nstate. This is the initial state used in cosmology. In fact it happens to define a deSitter\ninvariant state, also known as the Euclidean vacuum or the Bunch-Davies vacuum.\n5.4.1\n\nPrimordial perturbations from zero point fluctuations\n\nObservations of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation support the notion that\nthe origin of primordial perturbations lies in the quantum fluctuations of scalar and\ntensor metric modes (see [27] for a recent review and [28] for a classic reference.) The\nscalar modes arise from (and indeed are entirely determined by, since the metric has no\n\n28\n\n\findependent scalar degree of freedom) coupling to matter.5 Let's briefly discuss how this\nworks for a massless minimally coupled scalar field, which is just how these perturbations\nare described. First I'll describe the scenario in words, then add a few equations.\nConsider a field mode with a frequency high compared to the expansion rate \u0227/a\nduring the early universe. To be specific let us assume this rate to be a constant H,\ni.e. de Sitter inflation. Such a mode was presumably in its ground state, as the prior\nexpansion would have redshifted away any initial excitation. As the universe expanded\nthe frequency redshifted until it became comparable to the expansion rate, at which\npoint the oscillations ceased and the field amplitude approached a time-independent\nvalue. Just before it stopped oscillating the field had quantum zero point fluctuations\nof its amplitude, which were then preserved during the further expansion. Since the\namplitude was frozen when the mode had the fixed proper wavenumber H, it is the\nsame for all modes apart from the proper volume factor in the mode normalization\nwhich varies with the cosmological time of freezeout. Finally after inflation ended the\nexpansion rate dropped faster than the wavenumber, hence eventually the mode could\nbegin oscillating again when its wavelength became shorter than the Hubble length H \u22121 .\nThis provided the seeds for density perturbations that would then grow by gravitational\ninteractions. On account of the particular wavevector dependence of the amplitude of\nthe frozen spatial fluctuations, the spectrum of these perturbations turns out to be\nscale-invariant (when appropriately defined).\nMore explicitly, the field equation for a massless minimally coupled field is given by\n(5.29), with\n\u03c9 2(\u03b7) = k 2 \u2212 a\u2032\u2032 /a = k 2 \u2212 2H 2 a2 ,\n(5.44)\nwhere the last equality holds in de Sitter space. In terms of proper frequency \u03c9p = \u03c9/a\nand proper wavenumber kp = k/a we have \u03c9p2 = kp2 \u2212 2H 2. The first term is the usual\nflat space one that produces oscillations, while the second term tends to oppose the\noscillations. For proper wavenumbers much higher than H the second term is negligible.\nThe field oscillates while the proper wavenumber redshifts exponentially. Eventually the\ntwo terms cancel, and the mode stops oscillating. This happens when\n\u221a\n(5.45)\nkp = 2H.\nAs the wavenumber continues to redshift into the region kp \u226a H, to a good approximation the amplitude satisfies the equation \u03c7\u2032\u2032k \u2212 (a\u2032\u2032 /a)\u03c7k = 0, which has a growing and a\n5\n\nThe Cosmic Microwave Background observations supporting this account of primordial perturbations thus amount to quantum gravity observations of a limited kind.\n\n29\n\n\fdecaying solution6 . The growing solution is \u03c7k \u221d a, which implies that the field mode\nuk (5.27,5.28) is constant in time. (This conclusion is also evident directly from the fact\nthat the last term of the wave operator (5.26) vanishes as a grows.)\nThe squared amplitude of the fluctuations when frozen is, according to (4.27),\nh0|\u03c6\u2020k \u03c6k |0i = |u\u2212k |2 \u223c\n\n~H 2\n~\n=\n,\nk p Vp\nV k3\n\n(5.46)\n\nwhere the proper values are used for consistent matching to the previous flat space result.\nThis gives rise to the scale invariant spectrum of density perturbations.\n\n6\n\nBlack hole evaporation\n\nThe vacuum of a quantum field is unstable to particle emission in the presence of a black\nhole event horizon. This instability is called the Hawking effect. Unlike the cosmological\nparticle creation discussed in the previous section, this effect is not the result of time\ndependence of the metric exciting the field oscillators. Rather it is more like pair creation\nin an external electric field[13]. (For more discussion of the role of time dependence see\nsection 6.3.13.) A general introduction to the Hawking effect was given in section 2.2.\nThe present section is devoted to a derivation and discussion related topics.\nThe historical roots of the Hawking effect lie in the classical Penrose process for\nextracting energy from a rotating black hole. We first review that process and indicate\nhow it led to Hawking's discovery. Then we turn to the qft analysis.\n\n6.1\n\nHistorical sketch\n\nThe Kerr metric for a rotating black hole is stationary, but the asymptotic time translation Killing vector \u03c7 becomes spacelike outside the event horizon. The region where it is\nspacelike is called the ergoregion. The conserved Killing energy for a particle with fourmomentum p is E = \u03c7 * p. Physical particles have future pointing timelike 4-momenta,\nhence E is positive provided \u03c7 is also future timelike. Where \u03c7 is spacelike however,\nsome physical 4-momenta have negative Killing energy.\nIn the Penrose process, a particle of energy E0 > 0 is sent into the ergoregion of a\nrotating black hole where it breaks up into two pieces with Killing energies E1 and E2 ,\nso that E0 = E1 + E2 . If E2 is arranged to be negative, then E1 > E0 , that is, more\nenergy comes out than entered. The black hole absorbs the negative energy E2 and thus\n6\n\nThe general solution is c1 a + c2 a\n\nR\u03b7\n\nd\u03b7/a2 , which is c3 \u03b7 \u22121 + c4 \u03b7 2 in de Sitter space.\n\n30\n\n\floses mass. It also loses angular momentum, hence the process in effect extracts the\nrotational energy of the black hole.\nThe Penrose process is maximally efficient and reversible if the horizon area is unchanged. That condition is achievable in the limit that the absorbed particle enters the\nblack hole on a trajectory tangent to one of the null generators of the horizon. This\nrole of the horizon area in governing efficiency of energy extraction exhibits the analogy\nbetween area and entropy. Together with Bekenstein's information theoretic arguments,\nit gave birth to the subject of black hole thermodynamics.\nWhen a field scatters from a rotating black hole a version of the Penrose process\ncalled superradiant scattering can occur. The analogy with stimulated emission suggests\nthat quantum fields should exhibit spontaneous emission from a rotating black hole. To\ncalculate this emission rate from an \"eternal\" spinning black hole one must specify a\ncondition on the state of the quantum field that determines what emerges from the past\nhorizon. In order to avoid this unphysical specification Hawking considered instead a\nblack hole that forms from collapse, which has no past horizon. In this case only initial\nconditions before the collapse need be specified.\nMuch to his surprise, Hawking found that for any initial state, even a non-rotating\nblack hole will spontaneously emit radiation. This Hawking effect is a pair creation\nprocess in which one member of the pair lies in the ergoregion inside the horizon and\nhas negative energy, while the other member lies outside and escapes to infinity with\npositive energy. The Hawking radiation emerges in a steady flux with a thermal spectrum\nat the temperature TH = ~\u03ba/2\u03c0. The surface gravity \u03ba had already been seen to play\nthe role of temperature in the classical first law of black hole mechanics, which thus\nrather remarkably presaged the quantum Hawking effect.\n\n6.2\n\nThe Hawking effect\n\nTwo different notions of \"frequency\" are relevant to this discussion. One is the \"Killing\nfrequency\", which refers to time dependence with respect to the time-translation symmetry of the background black hole spacetime. In the asymptotically flat region at\ninfinity the Killing frequency agrees with the usual frequency defined by the Minkowski\nobservers at rest with respect to the black hole. The other notion is \"free-fall frequency\"\ndefined by an observer falling across the event horizon. Since the Killing flow is tangent\nto the horizon, Killing frequency there is very different from free-fall frequency, and that\ndistinction lies at the heart of the Hawking effect.\n\n31\n\n\f6.2.1\n\nAverage number of outgoing particles\n\nThe question to be answered is this: if a black hole forms from collapse with the quantum\nfield in any 'regular' state |\u03a8i, then at late times, long after the collapse, what will be the\naverage particle number and other observables for an outgoing positive Killing frequency\nwavepacket P of a quantum field far from the black hole? We address this question here\nfor the case of a noninteracting scalar field and a static (non-rotating) black hole At\nthe end we make some brief remarks about generalizations. Figure 1 depicts the various\ningredients in the following discussion.\n\n\u03a3f\n\nP\nT\n\nR\n\u03a3i\nfree\u2212fall observer\n\ncollapsing matter\nFigure 1:\n\nSpacetime diagram of black hole formed by collapsing matter. The outgoing\nwavepacket P splits into the transmitted part T and reflected part R when propagated backwards in time. The two surfaces \u03a3f,i are employed for evaluating the Klein-Gordon inner\nproducts between the wavepacket and the field operator. Although P , and hence R and T ,\nhave purely positive Killing frequency, the free-fall observer crossing T just outside the horizon\nsees both positive and negative frequency components with respect to his proper time.\n\nTo begin with we evaluate the expectation value h\u03a8|N(P )|\u03a8i of the number operator\n32\n\n\fN(P ) = a\u2020 (P )a(P ) in the quantum state |\u03a8i of the field. This does not fully characterize\nthe state, but it will lead directly to considerations that do.\nThe annihilation operator (4.11) corresponding to a normalized wavepacket P is\ngiven by\na(P ) = hP, \u03c6i\u03a3f ,\n(6.1)\nwhere the Klein-Gordon inner product (4.9) is evaluated on the \"final\" spacelike slice\n\u03a3f . To evaluate the expectation value of N(P ) we use the field equation satisfied by \u03c6\nto relate N(P ) to an observable on an earlier slice \u03a3i on which we know enough about\nthe quantum state. Specifically, we assume there are no incoming excitations long after\nthe black hole forms, and we assume that the state looks like the vacuum at very short\ndistances (or high frequencies) as seen by observers falling across the event horizon.\nHawking originally propagated the field through the time-dependent collapsing part of\nthe metric and back out all the way to spatial infinity, where he assumed |\u03a8i to be\nthe incoming vacuum at very high frequencies. As pointed out by Unruh[21] (see also\n[29, 30]) the result can be obtained without propagating all the way back, but rather\nstopping on a spacelike surface \u03a3i far to the past of \u03a3f but still after the formation of the\nblack hole. This is important since propagation back out to infinity invokes arbitrarily\nhigh frequency modes whose behavior may not be given by the standard relativistic free\nfield theory.\nIf \u03a3i lies far enough to the past of \u03a3f , the wavepacket P propagated backwards by\nthe Klein-Gordon equation breaks up into two distinct parts,\nP = R + T.\n\n(6.2)\n\n(See Fig. 1.) R is the \"reflected\" part that scatters from the black hole and returns\nto large radii, while T is the \"transmitted\" part that approaches the horizon. R has\nsupport only at large radii, and T has support only in a very small region just outside\nthe event horizon where it oscillates very rapidly due to the backwards gravitational\nblueshift. Since both the wavepacket P and the field operator \u03c6 satisfy the Klein-Gordon\nequation, the Klein-Gordon inner product in (6.1) can be evaluated on \u03a3i instead of \u03a3f\nwithout changing a(P ). This yields a corresponding decomposition for the annihilation\noperator,\na(P ) = a(R) + a(T ).\n(6.3)\nThus we have\nh\u03a8|N(P )|\u03a8i = h\u03a8|(a\u2020 (R) + a\u2020 (T ))(a(R) + a(T ))|\u03a8i.\n33\n\n(6.4)\n\n\fNow it follows from the stationarity of the black hole metric that the Killing frequencies in a solution of the KG equation are conserved. Hence the wavepackets R and\nT both have the same, purely positive Killing, frequency components as P . As R lies\nfar from the black hole in the nearly flat region, this means that it has purely positive\nasymptotic Minkowski frequencies, hence the operator a(R) is a bona fide annihilation\noperator-or rather hR, Ri1/2 times the annihilation operator-for incoming excitations.\nAssuming that long after the black hole forms there are no such incoming excitations,\nwe have a(R)|\u03a8i = 0. Equation (6.4) then becomes\nh\u03a8|N(P )|\u03a8i = h\u03a8|a\u2020 (T )a(T )|\u03a8i.\n\n(6.5)\n\nIf a(T )|\u03a8i = 0 as well, then no P -particles are emitted at all. The state with this\nproperty is called the \"Boulware vacuum\". It is the state with no positive Killing\nfrequency excitations anywhere, including at the horizon.\nThe Boulware vacuum does not follow from collapse however. The reason is that\nthe wavepacket T does not have purely positive frequency with respect to the time of\na free fall observer crossing the horizon, and it is this latter frequency that matches to\nthe local Minkowski frequency in a neighborhood of the horizon small compared with\nthe radius of curvature of the spacetime.\nMore precisely, consider a free-fall observer (i.e. a timelike geodesic x(\u03c4 )) with proper\ntime \u03c4 who falls across the horizon at \u03c4 = 0 at a point where the slice \u03a3i meets the\nhorizon (see Fig. 1). For this observer the wavepacket T has time dependence T (\u03c4 ) (i.e.\nT (x(\u03c4 ))) that vanishes for \u03c4 > 0 since the wavepacket has no support behind the horizon.\nSuch a function cannot possibly have purely positive frequency components. To see why,\nrecall that if a function vanishes on a continuous arc in a domain of analyticity, then it\nvanishes everywhere in that domain (since its power series vanishes identically on the\narc and hence by analytic continuation everywhere). Any positive frequency function\nZ \u221e\nh(\u03c4 ) =\nd\u03c9 e\u2212i\u03c9\u03c4 h\u0303(\u03c9)\n(6.6)\n0\n\nis analytic in the lower half \u03c4 plane, since the addition of a negative imaginary part to\n\u03c4 leaves the integral convergent. The positive real \u03c4 axis is the limit of an arc in the\nlower half plane, hence if h(\u03c4 ) were to vanish for \u03c4 > 0 it would necessarily vanish also\nfor \u03c4 < 0. (Conversely, a function that is analytic on the lower half-plane and does not\nblow up exponentially as |\u03c4 | \u2192 \u221e must contain only positive frequency components,\nsince exp(\u2212i\u03c9\u03c4 ) does blow up exponentially as |\u03c4 | \u2192 \u221e when \u03c9 is negative.)\n34\n\n\fThe wavepacket T can be decomposed into its positive and negative frequency parts\nwith respect to the free fall time \u03c4 ,\nT = T + + T \u2212,\n\n(6.7)\n\nwhich yields the corresponding decomposition of the annihilation operator\na(T ) = a(T + ) + a(T \u2212 )\n+\n\n\u2020\n\n= a(T ) \u2212 a (T \u2212 ).\n\n(6.8)\n(6.9)\n\nSince T \u2212 has negative KG norm, Eqn. (4.12) has been used in the last line to trade\na(T \u2212 ) for the bona fide creation operator a\u2020 (T \u2212 ). The \u03c4 -dependence of T consists of\nvery rapid oscillations for \u03c4 < 0, so the wavepackets T + and T \u2212 have very high energy\nin the free-fall frame.\nA free fall observer crossing the horizon long after the black hole forms would presumably see the ground state of the field at short distances, that is, such an observer\nwould see no very high positive free-fall frequency excitations. The reason is that the\ncollapse process occurs on the much longer time scale of the Schwarzschild radius rs , so\nthe modes with frequency much higher than 1/rs should remain in their ground state.\nWe therefore assume that the wavepackets T + and T \u2212 are in their ground states,\na(T + )|\u03a8i = 0,\n\na(T \u2212 )|\u03a8i = 0.\n\n(6.10)\n\nFor further discussion of this assumption see section 7.\nUsing (6.9) the number expectation value (6.5) can be evaluated as\nh\u03a8|N(P )|\u03a8i = h\u03a8|a(T \u2212 )a\u2020 (T \u2212 )|\u03a8i\n\u2020\n\n= h\u03a8|[a(T \u2212 ), a (T \u2212 )]|\u03a8i\n= hT \u2212 , T \u2212 i\u03a3i\n\n= \u2212hT \u2212 , T \u2212 i\u03a3i ,\n\n(6.11)\n(6.12)\n(6.13)\n(6.14)\n\nwhere (6.10) is used in the first and second lines, (4.13) is used in the third line, and\n(4.10) is used in the last step. The problem has thus been reduced to the computation\nof the Klein-Gordon norm of the negative frequency part of the transmitted wavepacket\nT . This requires that we be more explicit about the form of the wavepacket.\n6.2.2\n\nNorm of the negative frequency part & thermal flux\n\nFor definiteness we consider a spherically symmetric vacuum black hole in 3+1 dimensions, that is a Schwarzschild black hole. The Schwarzschild line element can variously\n35\n\n\fbe expressed as\nrs\nrs 2\n)dt \u2212 (1 \u2212 )\u22121 dr 2 \u2212 r 2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 )\nr\nr\nrs\n2\n2\n= (1 \u2212 )(dt \u2212 dr\u2217 ) \u2212 r 2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 )\nr\nrs\n= (1 \u2212 )du dv \u2212 r 2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 ).\nr\n\nds2 = (1 \u2212\n\n(6.15)\n(6.16)\n(6.17)\n\nThe first form is in \"Schwarzschild coordinates\" and rs = 2GM is the Schwarzschild\nradius. The second form uses the \"tortoise coordinate\" r\u2217 , defined by dr\u2217 = dr/(1\u2212rs /r)\nor r\u2217 = r + rs ln(r/rs \u2212 1), which goes to \u2212\u221e at the horizon. The third form uses the\nretarded and advanced time coordinates u = t \u2212 r\u2217 and v = t + r\u2217 , which are also called\noutgoing and ingoing null coordinates respectively.\nA scalar field satisfiying the Klein-Gordon equation (\u0003 + m2 )\u03c6 = 0 can be decomposed into spherical harmonics\n\u03c6(t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) =\n\nX \u03c6lm (t, r)\nr\n\nlm\n\nYlm (\u03b8, \u03c6),\n\n(6.18)\n\nwhere \u03c6lm (t, r) satisfies the 1+1 dimensional equation\n(\u2202t2 \u2212 \u2202r2\u2217 + Vlm )\u03c6lm = 0\n\n(6.19)\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nrs \u0011\u0010 rs l(l + 1)\n2\nVlm (r) = 1 \u2212\n+\n+\nm\n.\nr\nr3\nr2\n\n(6.20)\n\nwith the effective potential\n\nAs r \u2192 \u221e the potential goes to m2 . As r \u2192 rs , the factor (r \u2212 rs ) approaches zero\nexponentially as exp(r\u2217 /rs ) with respect to r\u2217 . Near the horizon \u03c6lm (t, r\u2217 ) therefore\nsatisfies the massless wave equation, hence has the general form f (u) + g(v).\nP\nSince the wavepacket P = lm Plm (t, r)Ylm(\u03b8, \u03c6) is purely outgoing with support\nonly at large radii at late times, near the horizon Plm (t, r) must be only a function of\nthe 'retarded time u = t \u2212 r\u2217 . That is, there can be no ingoing component. Since\nthe metric is static, i.e. invariant with respect to t-translations, we can decompose any\nsolution into components with a fixed t-frequency \u03c9. A positive frequency outgoing\nmode at infinity has t-dependence exp(\u2212i\u03c9t), hence its form near the horizon must be\nexp(\u2212i\u03c9u).\nConsider now a late time outgoing positive frequency wavepacket P that is narrowly\npeaked in Killing frequency \u03c9. Propagating backwards in time, T is the part of the\n36\n\n\fwavepacket that is squeezed up against the horizon, and its Ylm component has the form\nTlm \u223c exp(\u2212i\u03c9u) for all l, m. The coordinate u diverges as the horizon is approached.\nIt is related to the proper time \u03c4 of a free-fall observer crossing the horizon at \u03c4 = 0\nvia \u03c4 \u2243 \u2212\u03c40 exp(\u2212\u03bau), where \u03ba = 1/2rs is the surface gravity of the black hole and the\nconstant \u03c40 depends on the velocity of the free-fall observer.7 Hence the \u03c4 -dependence\nof the wavepacket along the free-fall worldline is\n\u0011\n\u0010 \u03c9\n(6.21)\nT \u223c exp i ln(\u2212\u03c4 )\n\u03ba\nfor \u03c4 < 0, and it vanishes for \u03c4 > 0.\nTo find the positive frequency part we use a method introduced by Unruh[31], which\nexploits the fact that a function analytic and bounded as |\u03c4 | \u2192 \u221e in the lower half\ncomplex \u03c4 plane has purely positive frequency (see the discussion after Eqn. (6.6)). The\npositive frequency extension of T (\u03c4 ) from \u03c4 < 0 to \u03c4 > 0 is thus obtained by analytic\ncontinuation of ln(\u2212\u03c4 ) in the lower half complex \u03c4 -plane. This continuation is given by\nln \u03c4 + i\u03c0, provided the branch cut of ln \u03c4 is taken in the upper half-plane. The positive\nfrequency extension of T (\u03c4 ) to \u03c4 > 0 is therefore obtained by replacing ln(\u2212\u03c4 ) with\nln \u03c4 + i\u03c0 in (6.21), which yields T (\u2212\u03c4 ) exp(\u2212\u03c0\u03c9/\u03ba) for \u03c4 > 0. Similarly, the negative\nfrequency extension of ln(\u2212\u03c4 ) is given by ln \u03c4 \u2212 i\u03c0, provided the branch cut of ln \u03c4 is\ntaken instead in the lower half-plane. The negative frequency extension of T (\u03c4 ) to \u03c4 > 0\nis therefore T (\u2212\u03c4 ) exp(+\u03c0\u03c9/\u03ba). Knowing these two extensions, we proceed as follows.\nDefine a new wavepacket Te, with support only inside the horizon, by \"flipping\" the\nwavepacket T (u) across the horizon (see Fig. 2). That is, Te vanishes outside the horizon\nand inside is constant on the outgoing null lines, with Te(\u03c4 ) = T (\u2212\u03c4 ) for \u03c4 > 0. The\nabove argument shows that the wavepackets\nT + = c+ (T + e\u2212\u03c0\u03c9/\u03ba Te)\nT \u2212 = c\u2212 (T + e+\u03c0\u03c9/\u03ba Te)\n\n(6.22)\n\n(6.23)\n\nhave positive and negative free-fall frequency respectively. The two constants c\u00b1 can\nbe chosen so that T + + T \u2212 agrees with T outside the horizon and vanishes (as does T )\ninside the horizon. This yields c\u2212 = (1 \u2212 e2\u03c0\u03c9/\u03ba )\u22121 and c + /c\u2212 = \u2212e2\u03c0\u03c9/\u03ba .\nNow hT, Tei = 0 (since the two wavepackets do not overlap) and hTe, Tei = \u2212hT, T i\n(since the flipped wavepacket has the reverse \u03c4 -dependence), so using (6.23) one finds\nhT \u2212 , T \u2212 i =\n7\n\nhT, T i\n.\n1 \u2212 e2\u03c0\u03c9/\u03ba\n\n(6.24)\n\nThis can be obtained by noting from the third form of the line element (6.17) that along a timelike\nline (1 \u2212 rs /r)u\u0307v\u0307 = 1, where the dots represent the proper time derivative. As the horizon is crossed v\u0307\nis finite, hence u\u0307 \u223c (r \u2212 rs )\u22121 \u223c e\u2212r\u2217 /rs = e(u\u2212v)/2rs \u223c e\u03bau .\n\n37\n\n\f~\ne \u2212+ \u03c0\u03c9/\u03ba T\n\nT\n\nFigure 2: Spacetime sketch of phase contours of the transmitted wavepacket T and its flipped\nversion Te on either side of the horizon (dashed line). The upper and lower signs in the exponent\nof the factor exp(\u2213\u03c0\u03c9/\u03ba) yield the positive and negative free-fall frequency extensions of T .\n\nInserting this in the expression (6.14) for the number operator expectation value yields\nHawking's result,\nhT, T i\nh\u03a8|N(P )|\u03a8i = 2\u03c0\u03c9/\u03ba\n.\n(6.25)\ne\n\u22121\nThe number expectation value (6.25) corresponds to the result for a thermal state at\nthe Hakwing temperature TH = ~\u03ba/2\u03c0, multiplied by the so-called \"greybody factor\"\n\u0393 = hT, T i.\n\n(6.26)\n\nThis factor is the probability for an excitation described by the the wavepacket P to\npile up just outside the event horizon when propagated backwards in time, rather than\nbeing scattered back out to infinity. Equivalently, \u0393 is the probability for the excitation\nwith wavepacket P to fall across the horizon when sent in forwards in time. This\nmeans that the black hole would be in detailed balance with a thermal bath at the\nHawking temperature. Yet another interpretation of \u0393 is the probability for an excitation\noriginating close to the horizon with normalized wavepacket T /hT, T i1/2 to escape to\ninfinity rather than scattering back and falling into the black hole.\n\n38\n\n\f6.2.3\n\nThe quantum state\n\nThe local free-fall vacuum condition (6.10) can be used to find the quantum state of\nthe near horizon modes. We can do that here just \"pair by pair\", since the field is\nnoninteracting so the state is the tensor product of the states for each outside/inside\npair.\nUsing (6.23) the vacuum conditions become\nh\ni\na(T + )|\u03a8i \u221d a(T ) \u2212 e\u2212\u03c0\u03c9/\u03ba a\u2020 (T\u0303 \u2217 ) |\u03a8i = 0\n(6.27)\nh\ni\n(6.28)\na(T \u2212 )|\u03a8i \u221d \u2212a\u2020 (T ) + e+\u03c0\u03c9/\u03ba a(T\u0303 \u2217 ) |\u03a8i = 0\n\n(here we use \u2217 instead of \"bar\" for complex conjugation of Te for typographical reasons).\nNote that since T and Te have negative norm (as explained before (6.24)), we have\nreplaced the corresponding annihilation operators by minus the creation operators of\ntheir conjugates. These equations define what is called the Unruh vacuum |Ui for these\nwavepacket modes.\nNow let |Bi denote the quantum state of the T and Te\u2217 modes such that\na(T )|Bi = 0\na(Te\u2217 )|Bi = 0.\n\n(6.29)\n\n(6.30)\n\nThis state is called the Boulware vacuum for these modes. In analogy with (5.16) and\n(5.17) the vacuum conditions (6.27,6.28) imply that the Unruh and Boulware vacua are\nrelated by\nh\ni\n|Ui \u221d exp e\u2212\u03c0\u03c9/\u03ba a\u2020 (T\u0302 )a\u2020 (T\u00ea\u2217 ) |Bi\n(6.31)\nwhere the hats denote the corresponding normalized wavepackets.\nThe Unruh vacuum is thus a two-mode squeezed state, analogous to the one (5.42)\nfound at each wavevector k in the case of cosmological pair creation. There each pair\nhad zero total momentum since the background was space translation invariant. In\nthe present case, each pair has zero total Killing energy, since the background is time\ntranslation invariant. The mode Te has the same positive Killing frequency as T has\n(because the Killing flow is symmetric under the flipping across the horizon operation\nthat defines Te), however its conjugate has negative Killing frequency, and therefore\nnegative Killing energy.\nThe Unruh vacuum is a pure state, but because of its entangled structure it becomes\nmixed when restricted to the exterior. To find that mixed state we expand the exponential in a series. Denoting by |nR,L i the level-n excitations of the modes T and Te\u2217\n39\n\n\frespectively, we have\n|Ui \u221d\nThe reduced density matrix is thus\n\nX\nn\n\nT rL |UihU| \u221d\n\ne\u2212n\u03c0\u03c9/\u03ba |nL i|nR i.\n\nX\nn\n\ne\u22122n\u03c0\u03c9/\u03ba |nR ihnR |,\n\n(6.32)\n\n(6.33)\n\na thermal canonical ensemble at the Hawking temperature.\nThe essence of the Hawking effect is the correlated structure of the local vacuum\nstate at short distances near the horizon and its thermal character outside the horizon.\nGiven this, the outgoing flux at infinity is just a consequence of the propagation of a\nfraction \u0393 (6.26) of each outgoing wavepacket from the horizon to infinity.\n\n6.3\n\nRemarks\n\nIn this subsection we make a large number of brief remarks about related topics that we\nhave no time or space to go into deeply. Where no references are given see the sources\nlisted at the end of the Introduction.\n6.3.1\n\nLocal temperature\n\nThe Hawking temperature refers to the Killing energy, or, since the Schwarzschild Killing\nvector is normalized at infinity, to the energy defined by a static observer at infinity. A\nstatic observer at finite radius will perceive the thermal state to have the blueshifted temperature Tloc = TH /|\u03be|, where |\u03be| is the local norm of the Schwarzschild time translation\nKilling vector. At infinity this is just the Hawking temperature, whereas it diverges as\nthe horizon is approached. This divergence is due to the infinite acceleration of the static\nobserver at the horizon and it occurs even for an accelerated observer in the Minkowski\nvacuum of flat spacetime (see section 6.3.4 below). A freely falling observer sees nothing\ndivergent.\n6.3.2\n\nEquilibrium state: Hartle-Hawking vacuum\n\nA black hole will be in equilibrium with an incoming thermal flux at the Hawking\ntemperature. The state that includes this incoming flux is called the Hartle-Hawking\nvacuum.\n\n40\n\n\f6.3.3\n\nStimulated emission\n\nSuppose that the field is not in the free-fall vacuum at the horizon (6.10), but rather\nthat there are n excitations in the mode T + , so that a\u2020 (T + )a(T + )|\u03a8i = nhT + , T + i|\u03a8i.\nThen instead of (6.14) the expectation value of the number operator will be\nh\u03a8|N(P )|\u03a8i = nhT, T i + (n + 1)hT \u2212 , T \u2212 i.\n\n(6.34)\n\nThat is, if n quanta are present to begin with in the T + mode, the observer at infinity\nwill observe in the P mode n + 1 times the usual number of Hawking quanta, in addition\nto n times the greybody factor (6.26). To produce a state in which the T + mode is\noccupied in standard physics one would have to send in particles of enormous energy\njust before the black hole formed[32]. As explained in section 7.4.2, however, transPlanckian considerations could in principle allow stimulated emission at times long after\nthe black hole formed. (This has nothing to do with the standard late time stimulated\nemission of the super-radiant modes of a rotating black hole[33, 34].)\n6.3.4\n\nUnruh effect\n\nThe argument given above for the structure of the vacuum near a black hole horizon\napplies equally well to the Minkowski vacuum near an acceleration horizon in flat spacetime, where it is known as the Unruh effect. From a logical point of view it might be\nbetter to introduce the Unruh effect first, and then export it to the neighborhood of a\nblack hole horizon to infer the Hawking effect. However, I chose here to go in the other\ndirection\nIn the Unruh effect the boost Killing field \u03beB = x\u2202t + t\u2202x (which generates hyperbolic\nrotations) plays the role of the Schwarzschild time translation, and the corresponding\n\"temperature\" is ~/2\u03c0. The Minkowski vacuum is the analog of the Hartle-Hawking\nequilibrium state, rather than the Unruh evaporating state. A uniformly accelerated\nobserver following a hyperbolic orbit of the Killing field will perceive the Minkowski vacuum as a thermal state with temperature ~/2\u03c0|\u03beB |. The norm |\u03beB | is just (x2 \u2212 t2 )1/2 ,\nwhich is also the inverse of the acceleration of the orbit, hence the local temperature is\nthe Unruh temperature TU = ~a/2\u03c0. As (x2 \u2212 t2 )1/2 \u2192 \u221e this temperature is redshifted\nto zero, so a Killing observer at infinity sees only the zero temperature vacuum. As the\nacceleration horizon x = \u00b1t is approached a Killing observer sees a diverging temperature. The same temperature divergence is seen by a static observer approaching the\nhorizon of a black hole in the Unruh or Hartle-Hawking states (cf. section 6.3.1 above).\n\n41\n\n\f6.3.5\n\nRotating black hole\n\nA small portion of the event horizon of a rotating black hole is indistinguishable from\nthat of a Schwarzschild black hole, so the Hawking effect carries over to that case as\nwell. The frequency \u03c9 in (6.25) should be replaced by the frequency with respect to\nthe horizon generating Killing field \u2202t + \u03a9H \u2202\u03c6 , where \u2202t and \u2202\u03c6 are the asymptotic time\ntranslation and rotation Killing vectors, and \u03a9H is the angular velocity of the horizon.\nThus \u03c9 is replaced by \u03c9 \u2212 m\u03a9H , where m denotes the angular momentum. In effect\nthere is a chemical potential m\u03a9H . See e.g. [35] for a discussion of the quantization of\nthe \"super-radiant\" modes with \u03c9 \u2212 m\u03a9H < 0.\n6.3.6\n\nde Sitter space\n\nThe reasoning in the black hole case applies mutatis mutandis to de Sitter spacetime,\nwhere an observer is surrounded by a horizon that is locally indistinguishable from a\nblack hole horizon. This leads to the temperature of deSitter spacetime[25, 26].\n6.3.7\n\nHigher spin fields\n\nThe Hawking effect occurs also for higher spin fields, the only difference being (1) the\ngreybody factors are different, and (2) for half-integer spin fields the Fermi distribution\nrather than the Bose distribution arises for the Hawking emission.\n6.3.8\n\nInteracting fields\n\nOur discussion here exploited the free field equation of motion, but the Hawking effect\noccurs for interacting fields as well. The essence, as in the free field case, is the Unruh effect, the interacting version of which can easily be established with the help of a\nEuclidean functional integral representation of the Minkowski vacuum[36]. (This result\nwas found a decade earlier, at about the same time as the original Unruh effect, via\na theorem[37] in the context of axiomatic quantum field theory, although the interpretation in terms of the thermal observations of uniformly accelerated observers was not\nnoted until later[38].) The direct analog for the Hawking effect involves a Euclidean\nfunctional integral expression for the interacting Hartle-Hawking equilibrium state (for\nan introduction see [39, 40] and references therein).\nMore directly, in an asymptotically free theory one can presumably use the free field\nanalysis to discover the structure of the vacuum near the horizon as in the free field\ncase. The propagation of the field from that point on will involve the interactions. If\n42\n\n\fthe Hawking temperature is much higher than the scale \u039b of asymptotic freedom then\nfree particles will stream away from the black hole and subsequently be \"dressed\" by the\ninteractions and fragment into asymptotic states[41, 42]. If the Hawking temperature\nis much lower than \u039b then it is not so clear (to me at least) how to determine what is\nemitted.\n6.3.9\n\nStress-energy tensor\n\nThe Unruh and Hartle-Hawking states are \"regular\" on the horizon, i.e. they look like\nthe Minkowski vacuum at short distances. (Recall that it is precisely the local vacuum\nproperty (6.10) or (6.27,6.28) that determines the thermal state of the outgoing modes\nat infinity.) Hence the mean value of the stress energy tensor is finite. The Boulware\nstate |Bi referred to above is obtained by removing the T , Te\u2217 pair excitations. This\nproduces a state with a negative mean energy density that diverges as the horizon is\napproached. In fact, if even just one Hawking quantum is removed from the Unruh state\n|Ui to obtain the Boulware state for that mode, a negative energy density divergence\nwill be produced at the horizon. This can be viewed as the result of the infinite blueshift\nof the negative energy \"hole\". That is quite odd in the context of flat space, since the\nMinkowski vacuum should be the lowest energy state, hence any other state should have\nhigher energy. The explanation is that there is a positive energy density divergence on\nthe horizon that more than compensates the negative energy off the horizon[43].\n6.3.10\n\nBack-reaction\n\nAs previously noted the Unruh state corresponds to an entangled state of positive and\nnegative Killing energy excitations. As the positive energy excitations escape to infinity,\nthere must be a corresponding negative energy flux into the black hole. Studies of the\nmean value of the stress tensor confirm this. Turning on the gravitational dynamics, this\nwould lead to a mass loss for the black hole via the Einstein equation. The backreaction\ndriven by the mean value is called the \"semi-classical\" evolution. There are quantum\nfluctuations about this mean evolution on a time and length scale of the Schwarzschild\nradius, unless a large number of matter fields is invoked to justify a large N limit that\nsuppresses the quantum fluctuations.\n6.3.11\n\nStatistical entropy\n\nThe entangled structure (6.32) of the Unruh state leads to a mixed state (6.33) when observations are restricted to the region outside the horizon. The \"entanglement entropy\"\n43\n\n\f\u2212T r\u03c1 ln \u03c1 of this state is the same as the thermal entropy of the canonical ensemble\n(6.33). Summing over all modes this entropy diverges due to the infinite density of\nmodes. To characterize the divergence one can use the thermodynamic entropy density\ns \u221d T 3 of a bath of radiation at temperature T . The local temperature measured by a\nstatic observer (cf. section 6.3.1) is given by\nTloc = TH /|\u03be| \u2243 TH /\u03bal = 1/2\u03c0l,\n\n(6.35)\n\nwhere l is the proper distance to the horizon on a surface of constant t, and the relation\n\u03ba = (d|\u03be|/dl)H has been used. Thus the entropy diverges like\nZ\nZ\n3\nS = s dv \u223c Tloc\ndld2A \u223c A/l2c ,\n(6.36)\nwhere lc is a cutoff length above the horizon.8\nWhat is the meaning of this entropy? It seems clear on the one hand that it must\nbe included in the black hole entropy, but on the other hand it must somehow be meaningfully cut off. It is natural to try to understand the scaling of the black hole entropy\nwith area in this way, but this is only the contribution from one quantum field, and\nthere is also the classical contribution from the gravitational field itself that emerges\nfrom the partition function for quantum gravity[47]. The apparent dependence on the\nnumber of fields is perhaps removed by the corresponding renormalization of Newton's\nconstant[48]. (The last reference in [48] is a review.) However this is regularization\ndependent and hence difficult to interpret physically, and moreover at least in dimensional regularization vector fields and some non-minimally coupled scalars contribute\nnegatively to renormalizing G, which does not seem to match the entanglement entropy.\nThere has been much work in this area but it remains to be fully understood.\n6.3.12\n\nInformation loss\n\nTwo types of potential information loss occur in black hole physics. First, when something falls into a black hole any information it carries is apparently lost to the outside\nworld. Second, when a black hole radiates Hawking quanta, each radiated quantum is\nentangled with a partner lying inside the horizon, as Eqn. (6.32) shows. As long as the\n8\n\nSorkin[44] introduced the notion of black hole entanglement entropy, and with collaborators[45]\ncomputed it in the presence of a regulator. A mode-by-mode version of the thermal entropy calculation\nwas first done by 't Hooft[46], who called it the \"brick wall model\" because of a Dirichlet boundary\ncondition applied at lc .\n\n44\n\n\fblack hole does not evaporate completely, all information remains available on a spacelike surface that crosses the horizon and enters the black hole. If on the other hand the\nblack hole evaporates completely, then no single spacelike surface stretching to infinity\nand filling \"all space\" can capture all information, according to the semi-classical analysis of the Hawking effect. Rather a disconnected surface behind the horizon must be\nincluded. The information on this disconnected surface flows into the strong curvature\nregion at the singularity, where its fate is not yet understood.\nThis situation has generated much discussion. Some researchers (myself included)\nsee the information loss to the outside world not as a sign of the breakdown of quantum\nmechanics but just as a consequence of the mutability of spatial topology in quantum\ngravity. When a black hole is about to evaporate completely it looks very small to the\nworld outside the horizon. However this outside smallness has absolutely nothing to do\nwith the size of the region inside available for storing information. Let us look into this\na bit more.\nConsider for example the spacelike singularity at r = 0 inside the Schwarzschild black\nhole. The metric in Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates is\nds2 = (1 \u2212 rs /r)dv 2 \u2212 2dvdr \u2212 r 2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ),\n\n(6.37)\n\nwhere v = t + r\u2217 is the advanced time coordinate defined below (6.17). Inside the\nhorizon, where r < rs , a line of constant r, \u03b8, \u03c6 is spacelike, and has a proper length\nL(r, \u2206v) = (rs /r \u2212 1)1/2 \u2206v. This goes to infinity as the singularity is approached, for\nany interval of advanced time \u2206v. Hence there is no dearth of space inside. On the\nother hand, the transverse angular dimensions go to zero size, and also we do not know\nhow to describe the spacetime too near to the singularity. Therefore let's stop at the\n1/3\nradius where the curvature \u223c rs /r 3 is equal to the Planck curvature, i.e at r \u223c rs in\n1/3\n1/3\nPlanck units. Then then proper length goes as L(rs , \u2206v) \u223c rs \u2206v. For a solar mass\n1/3\nblack hole we have rs \u223c 1 km \u223c 1038 in Planck units, so rs \u223c 1013 . That means that\nfor an external advanced time of \u2206v = 1 second, the proper length inside is one million\nlight years. After a day or so, the length is the size of the universe, and so on over the\nHawking lifetime rs3 \u223c 10114 .\n1/3\nWhat happens to the future of this spacelike r = rs cylinder inside the black hole\nis governed by quantum gravity. We don't know what form the evolution takes. It is\nconceivable that time just stops running, like a frozen engine, producing a boundary of\nspacetime. It seems much more likely however that spacetime persists beyond, either\ninto \"quantum foam\" or into a plump baby universe (see e.g. [49] and references therein)\nor universes[50]. In any of these scenarios, the tiny outside size of a black hole at the\n45\n\n\fend stage of Hawking evaporation is no indication of the information carrying capacity\nof the interior.\nOthers believe that the validity of quantum mechanics requires that all information\nwinds up available on the exterior slice after the evaporation. Results from string theory\nare often invoked to support this viewpoint. (For a critique of these arguments see [51].)\nIf true, it would require some breakdown of the semi-classical description where none\nseems to be otherwise called for. The role of ultra high frequencies in the Hawking effect\nis often brought up in this context, however they are irrelevant since the derivation of\nthe correlated structure of the vacuum and the Hawking effect does not need to access\nthose frequencies. For more on this see the discussion of the trans-Planckian question\nin section 7.\n6.3.13\n\nRole of the black hole collapse\n\nThe Hawking flux continues in a steady state long after the collapse that forms a black\nhole, which suggests that the collapse phase has nothing to do with the Hawking effect.\nIndeed the derivation given above makes use of only the free-fall vacuum conditions near\nthe horizon, and the collapse phase plays no role. On the other hand if, as Hawking originally did, we follow the positive Killing frequency wavepacket T all the way backwards\nin time, it would go through the collapse phase and back out to infinity where Killing\nfrequency and free-fall frequency coincide. Were it not for the time dependence of the\nbackground during the collapse, there would be no change of the Killing frequency, so\nthere would be no negative frequency part of the ingoing wavepacket and there would\nbe no particle creation. As discussed in the following section this propagation through\nthe collapse phase invokes ultra high frequency field modes, and therefore may not even\nbe physically relevant. However it seems clear is that whatever physics delivers the outgoing vacuum near the horizon, it must involve some violation of the time translation\nsymmetry of the classical black hole background, even if it does not involve the collapse\nphase. In the lattice model of section 7.3 the violation arises from microscopic time dependence of the lattice spacing. In quantum gravity it may come just from the quantum\ngravitational fluctuations (see section 7.4.3).\n\n7\n\nThe trans-Planckian question\n\nA deep question arises on account of the infinite redshift at the black hole horizon: do\nthe outgoing modes that carry the Hawking radiation really emerge from a reservoir\n46\n\n\fof modes with frequency arbitrarily far beyond the Planck frequency just outside the\nhorizon, or is there another possibility? Does the existence or properties of the Hawking\neffect depend on the existence of such a trans-Planckian reservoir?\nThe reasoning leading to the expression (6.32) for the Unruh state in terms of positive\nKilling frequency modes is largely shielded from this question. The essential input is the\nfree-fall vacuum conditions (6.10), which can be applied at any length or time scale much\nshorter than the Schwarzschild radius and inverse surface gravity (which are roughly the\nsame unless the black hole is near extremally rotating or charged). There is no need to\nappeal to Planckian or trans-Planckian frequencies.\nFrom this persepctive it is clear that, as far as the derivation of the Hawking effect\nis concerned, the only question is whether or not the free-fall vacuum in fact arises at\nshort distances near the horizon from the initial conditions before collapse. As mentioned\nearlier, the modes with frequencies much higher than the inverse of the collapse time\nscale would be expected to remain unexcited. Nevertheless, in standard relativistic field\ntheory these modes arise from trans-Planckian modes.\nConsider an outgoing wavepacket near the horizon and peaked around frequency \u03c91ff\nas measured by a free-fall observer crossing the horizon at the advanced time v1 . At an\nearlier time v2 = v1 \u2212 \u2206v, the wavepacket would be blueshifted and squeezed closer to\nthe horizon, with exponentially higher free-fall frequency,\n\u03c92ff /\u03c91ff \u223c e\u03ba\u2206v = e\u2206v/2Rs .\n\n(7.1)\n\nFor a solar mass black hole and \u2206v = 2 seconds, the ratio is exp(105 ).\nTo predict the state of the positive free-fall frequency modes T + and T \u2212 from the\ninitial state thus seems to require trans-Planckian physics. This is a breakdown of the\nusual separation of scales invoked in the application of effective field theory and it leaves\nsome room for doubt[52, 30, 53] about the existence of the Hawking effect.\nWhile the physical arguments for the Hawking effect do seem quite plausible, the\ntrans-Planckian question is nevertheless pressing. After all, there are reasons to suspect\nthat the trans-Planckian modes do not even exist. They imply an infinite contribution to black hole entanglement entropy from quantum fields, and they produce other\ndivergences in quantum field theory that are not desirable in a fundamental theory.\nThe trans-Planckian question is really two-fold:\n1. Is the Hawking effect universal, i.e. insensitive to short distance physics, or at\nleast can it be reliably derived in a quantum gravity theory with acceptable short\ndistance behavior?\n47\n\n\f2. If there is no trans-Planckian reservoir, from where do the outgoing black hole\nmodes arise?\n\n7.1\n\nString theory viewpoint\n\nString theory has made impressive progress towards answering the first question, at\nleast for some special black holes. In particular[54, 55], some near-extremal black holes\nbecome well-understood D-brane configurations in the weak coupling limit, and supersymmetry links the weak coupling to strong coupling results. Thus the Hawking effect\ncan be reliably analyzed in a full quantum gravity theory. By a rather remarkable and\nunexpected correspondence the computations yield agreement with the semi-classical\npredictions, at least in the long wavelength limit. Moreover, the D-brane entropy is\nunderstood in terms of the counting of microstates, and agrees with the corresponding black hole entropy at strong coupling, just as the supersymmetry reasoning says\nit should. From yet another angle, the AdS/CFT duality in string theory offers other\nsupport[56]. There the Hawking effect and black hole entropy are interpreted in terms of\na thermal state of the CFT (a conformally invariant super-Yang-Mills theory). However,\nneither of these approaches from string theory has so far been exploited to address the\norigin of the outgoing modes, since a local spacetime picture of the black hole horizon\nis lacking. This seems to be a question worth pursuing.\n\n7.2\n\nCondensed matter analogy\n\nCondensed matter physics provides an analogy for effective field theory with a fundamental cutoff, hence it can be used to explore the consequences of a missing trans-Planckian\nreservoir. (For a review of these ideas see [57], and for a very brief summary see [58].)\nThe first such black hole analog was Unruh's sonic black hole, which consists of a fluid\nwith an inhomogeneous flow exceeding the speed of sound at a sonic horizon. A molecular fluid does not support wavelengths shorter than the intermolecular spacing, hence\nthe sonic horizon has no \"trans-molecular\" reservoir of outgoing modes. Unruh found\nthat nevertheless outgoing modes are produced, by a process of \"mode conversion\" from\ningoing to outgoing modes. This phenomenon comes about already because of the alteration of the dispersion relation for the sound waves. It has been studied in various field\ntheoretic models, however none are fully satisfactory since the unphysical short distance\nbehavior of the field is always eventually called into play. The model that most closely\nmirrors the fluid analogy is a falling lattice[59] which has sensible short distance physics.\n\n48\n\n\fThe mode conversion on the lattice involves what is known as a Bloch oscillation in the\ncondensed matter context. Here I will briefly explain how it works.\n\n7.3\n\nHawking effect on a falling lattice\n\nThe model is 2d field theory on a lattice of points falling freely into a black hole. We\nbegin with the line element in Gaussian normal coordinates,\nds2 = dt2 \u2212 a2 (t, z) dz 2 .\n\n(7.2)\n\nA line of constant z is an infalling geodesic, at rest at infinity, and the \"local scale factor\"\na(t, z) satisfies\na(t, z \u2192 \u221e) = 1\n\n(7.3)\n\na(0, z) = 1\n\na(t, zH (t)) \u223c \u03bat\n\n(7.4)\n> 1,\nfor \u03bat \u223c\n\n(7.5)\n\nexpressing the facts that the metric is asymptotically flat, the coordinate z measures\nproper distance on the t = 0 time slice, and at the horizon zH (t) the time scale for\nvariations of the local scale factor is the surface gravity \u03ba. The specific form of a(t, z)\nis not required for the present discussion. (For details see [59].) A scalar field on this\nspacetime is governed by the action\nZ\n\u221a\n1\nd2 x \u2212gg \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u2202\u03bd \u03c6\n(7.6)\nS =\n2\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\n1\n1\n2\n2\ndtdz a(z, t)(\u2202t \u03c6) \u2212\n(7.7)\n(\u2202z \u03c6) .\n=\n2\na(t, z)\nNow we discretize the z coordinate with spacing \u03b4:\nz \u2192 zm = m\u03b4,\n\n\u2202z \u03c6 \u2192 D\u03c6 =\n\n\u03c6m+1 \u2212 \u03c6m\n,\n\u03b4\n\n(7.8)\n\nwhere \u03c6m = \u03c6(zm ). The proper distance between the lattice points zm and zm+1 on a\nconstant t slice is approximately a(t, zm )\u03b4. At t = 0 this is just \u03b4 everywhere, that is the\npoints start out equidistant. However, since they are on free fall trajectories at different\ndistances from the horizon, they spread out as time goes on. In particular the lattice\nspacing at the horizon grows with time like \u223c \u03bat.\nThe discretized action is\n\u0015\nZ\nX\u0014\n2(D\u03c6m (t))2\n1\n2\ndt\nam (t)(\u2202t \u03c6m ) \u2212\n.\n(7.9)\nSlattice =\n2\na\n(t)\n+\na\n(t)\nm+1\nm\nm\n49\n\n\fThe discrete field equations produce the dispersion relation\n\u03c9 ff (k) = \u00b1\n\n2\nsin(k\u03b4/2)\na(z, t)\u03b4\n\n(7.10)\n\nfor a mode of the form exp(\u2212i\u03c9 ff t + ikz), provided \u2202t a \u226a \u03c9 ff and \u2202z a \u226a k. (See Fig. 3.)\nFor small wave numbers the lattice dispersion agrees with the continuum, however it is\n2\n\n1\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\nFigure 3: Dispersion relation \u03c9\u03b4 = \u00b12 sin(k\u03b4/2) plotted vs. k\u03b4. Wavevectors differing by\n2\u03c0/\u03b4 are equivalent. Only the Brillouin zone |k| \u2264 \u03c0/\u03b4 is shown.\n\nperiodic in translation of k by 2\u03c0/\u03b4. At the wavenumber k = \u03c0/\u03b4 there is a maximum\nfrequency 2/a\u03b4 and vanishing group velocity d\u03c9/dk . Beyond that wavenumber the\ngroup velocity reverses, and k is equivalent to k \u2212 2\u03c0/\u03b4 which lies in the Brillouin zone\n|k| \u2264 \u03c0/\u03b4.\nOn the lattice the trans-Planckian redshift cannot take place, because of the lattice cutoff. Hence the outgoing modes-provided they exist-must come from ingoing\nmodes. Both WKB \"eikonal\" trajectory and numerical evolution of the discrete wave\nequation confirm that indeed this occurs. The behavior of a typical wavepacket throughout the process of bouncing off the horizon is illustrated in Fig. 4. The real part of the\nwavepacket is plotted vs. the static coordinate at several different times. Following\nbackwards in time, the packet starts to squeeze up against the horizon and then a trailing dip freezes and develops oscillations that grow until they balloon out, forming into\na compact high frequency wavepacket that propagates neatly away from the horizon\nbackwards in time.\nThe mode conversion can be understood as follows, following a wavepacket peaked\naround a long wavelength \u03bb \u226b \u03b4 backwards in time. The wavepacket blueshifts as it\napproaches the horizon, eventually enough for the lattice structure and therefore the\ncurvature of the dispersion relation to be felt. At this point its group velocity begins\n50\n\n\fFigure 4: A typical wavepacket evolution on the lattice. The oscillations of the incoming\nwavepacket are too dense to resolve in the plots.\nto drop. In the WKB calculation the wavepacket motion reverses direction at a turning\npoint outside the horizon. This occurs before its group velocity in the falling lattice\nframe is negative, so it is falling in at that stage because its outward velocity is not\ngreat enough to overcome the infalling of the lattice.\nAs the wavepapcket continues backwards in time now away from the black hole its\nwavevector continues to grow until it goes past the edge of the Brillouin zone, thus\nbecoming an ingoing mode also in the lattice frame. This reversal of group velocity is\nprecisely what happens in a \"Bloch oscillation\" when a quantum particle in a periodic\npotential is accelerated. As the turnaround is occuring, another equally important effect is that the time-dependence of the underlying lattice is felt. Thus, unlike in the\ncontinuum limit of this stationary background, the Killing frequency of the wavepacket\nis no longer conserved.\nFollowing the wavepacket all the way backwards in time out to the asymptotic region,\nit winds up with a short wavelength of order \u03b4 and a large frequency of order 1/\u03b4. This\nfrequency shift is absolutely critical to the existence of the outgoing modes, since an\ningoing low frequency mode would simply fall across the horizon. Only the \"exotic\"\nmodes with sufficiently high frequency will undergo the mode conversion process.\nThe Hawking flux is determined by the negative frequency part of the ingoing\n\n51\n\n\fwavepacket. The eikonal approximation just described does not capture the negative\nfrequency mixing which occurs during the turnaround at the horizon. Just as in the\ncontinuum, the wavepacket squeezed against the horizon has both positive and negative\nfree-fall frequency components. As these components propagate backwards in time away\nfrom the horizon, their frequency slowly shifts, but their relative amplitude remains fixed.\nHence the norm of the negative freqency part of the incoming wavepacket turns out to\nbe just what the continuum Hawking effect indicates, with small lattice corrections. Put\ndifferently, the infalling vacuum is adiabatically modified by the underlying microscopic\ntime dependence of the lattice in such a way that the Unruh conditions (6.10) on the\nstate of the outgoing modes at the horizon are satisfied.\n\n7.4\n7.4.1\n\nRemarks\nFinite Entanglement entropy\n\nSince the lattice has a short distance cutoff the entanglement entropy between the modes\njust inside and outside of the horizon is finite at any time. As illustrated in Figure 5, any\ngiven entangled pair of vacuum modes began in the past outside the horizon, propagated\ntowards the horizon where it was \"split\", and then separated, with one half falling in\nand the other converted into an outgoing mode. As time goes on, new pairs continually\npropagate in and maintain a constant entanglement entropy.\n\nplanckian\nancestors\ntransplanckian\nancestors\nFigure 5: The ancestors of a Hawking quantum and its negative energy partner. In standard relativistic field theory the ancestors are trans-Planckian and pass through the collapsing\nmatter at the moment of horizon formation. On the lattice the ancestors ar Planckian and\npropagate in towards the black hole at late times.\n\n52\n\n\f7.4.2\n\nStimulated emission of Hawking radiation at late times\n\nAs discussed in section 6.3.3, if the Unruh vacuum conditions (6.10) do not hold at\nthe horizon then stimulated emission of Hawking radiation will occur. In the falling\nlattice model, these horizon modes arise from ingoing modes long after the black hole\nformed as shown in Figure 5. Thus it is possible to stimulate the emission of Hawking\nradiation by sending in radiation at late times, in contrast to the usual continuum\ncase of a static black hole. This seems a generic feature of theories with a cutoff, for\nwhich the outgoing modes must arise from modes that are ingoing after the collapse.\n(Something like it should happen also in string theory if, as many suppose, the transPlanckian reservoir at the horizon is also eliminated there.) Note however that the linear\nmodel described here is surely a gross oversimplification. Turning on the gravitational\ninteractions between the modes and the background, one is led to a picture in which the\nmodes \"dissipate\" when propagated backwards in time to the Planckian regime. Hence\nwhat really produces the outgoing Hawking quantum must be a complicated collective\nmode of the interacting vacuum that \"anti-dissipates\" as it approaches the horizon and\nturns around. Calculations exploring this in quantum gravity were carried out in [60].\n7.4.3\n\nLattice time dependence and geometry fluctuations\n\nThe microscopic time dependence of the lattice, i.e. the slow spreading of the lattice\npoints, plays a critical role in transforming an ingoing mode with high Killing frequency\nto an outgoing mode with low Killing frequency, and in allowing for mixing of positive\nand negative frequencies despite the stationarity of the continuum black hole background. This suggests the conjecture that in quantum gravity the underlying quantum\nfluctuations of the geometry that do not share the stationarity of the black hole background metric might play this role. A step towards understanding this might be provided\nby a two or three dimensional version of the lattice model, in which the density of lattice\npoints remains fixed but their microscopic positions fluctuate. This is precisely what\nhappens with an inhomogeneous flow of a real molecular fluid. The quantum gravity\nanalysis of [60] lends some support to this conjecture, though it is not clear whether\nthe Lorentz violation seen there is just an artifact of a non-covariant cutoff or a feature\nintroduced by the global geometry of the black hole spacetime.\n\n53\n\n\f7.5\n\nTrans-Planckian question in cosmology\n\nThe modes producing the inflationary perturbation spectrum (cf. section 5.4.1) redshift\nexponentially from their trans-Planckian origins. It has been suggested that this might\nleave a visible imprint on the perturbation spectrum, via a modified high frequency\ndispersion relation and/or a modified initial quantum state for the field modes. As illustrated by the Hawking process on the lattice however, as long as the redshifting is\nadiabatic on the timescale of the modes, they would remain in their ground states. If\nthe Hubble rate H during inflation were much less than the Planck mass MP (or whatever scale the modified dispersion sets in) the modes could be treated in the standard\nrelativistic manner by the time the perturbation spectrum is determined. At most one\nmight expect an effect of order H/MP , and some analyses suggest the effect will be even\nsmaller. This all depends on what state the modes are in. They cannot be too far from\nthe vacuum, since otherwise running them backwards in time they would develop an\nexponentially growing energy density which would be incompatible with the inflationary\ndynamics. Hence it seems the best one can say at present is that there may be room for\nnoticable deviations from the inflationary predictions, if H/MP is large enough. (See for\nexample [61] and references therein for discussions of these issues.)\n\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank the organizers of the CECS School on Quantum Gravity both for\na stimulating, enjoyable experience, and for extraordinary patience.
