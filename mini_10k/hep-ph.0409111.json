A. Dominguez, T. Thapedi\nInstitute of Theoretical Physics and Astrophysics\nUniversity of Cape Town, Rondebosch 7700, South Africa\n\nAbstract\nThe electromagnetic form factors of the proton are obtained using a particular realization of QCD in\nthe large Nc limit (QCD\u221e ), which sums up the infinite number of zero-width resonances to yield an\nEuler's Beta function (Dual-QCD\u221e ). The form factors F1 (q 2 ) and F2 (q 2 ), as well as GM (q 2 ) agree\nvery well with reanalyzed space-like data in the whole range of momentum transfer. In addition, the\npredicted ratio \u03bcp GE /GM is in good agreement with recent polarization transfer measurements at\nJefferson Lab.\n\n\u2217 Work\n\nsupported in part by the Volkswagen Foundation\n\n\fQuantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in the limit of large number of colours (QCD\u221e ) [1] is known to predict\na hadronic spectrum consisting of an infinite number of zero-width resonances[2]. However, since real QCD\nhas never been solved exactly and analytically, the hadronic parameters (masses, couplings, etc.) remain\nunpredicted. A few models of this spectrum have been proposed for heavy quark Green's functions [3]-[4],\nas well as for light quark systems [5]. The infinite number of zero-width resonances of QCD\u221e is reminiscent of Veneziano's dual-resonance model [6], the precursor of string theory. In fact, inspiration from this\nmodel has led to a proposal called Dual-QCD\u221e [7], a specific realization of QCD\u221e where the masses and\ncouplings in a Green's function are chosen to yield an Euler's Beta function of the Veneziano type. For\nthree-point functions, the form factors exhibit asymptotic Regge-behaviour, i.e. power-behaviour, in the\nspace-like region controlled by a single free parameter. Dual-QCD\u221e has been applied quite successfully\nto the electromagnetic form factor of the pion in the space-like region [7]. Indeed, results are in excellent\nagreement with experiment, far better than e.g. naive Vector Meson (rho-) Dominance or purely perturbative QCD [8]. This is the case not only for the pion form factor itself, but also for the mean-square\nradius, and the observed deviation from universality (the ratio g\u03c1\u03c0\u03c0 /f\u03c1 ) . In addition, unitarization of\nDual-QCD\u221e leads to a prediction of the vector two-point spectral function, in the time-like region, in\nreasonable agreement with data (a more refined model in the time-like region has been proposed recently\nin [9]). Encouraged by this success, we discuss in this note an analysis of the electromagnetic proton form\nfactors in the framework of Dual-QCD\u221e .\n\nThe Dirac and Pauli form factors of the proton, F1 (q 2 ) and F2 (q 2 ), respectively, are defined as\n< N (p2 )|J\u03bcEM (0)|N (p1 ) >= \u016bN (p2 ) [F1 (q 2 )\u03b3\u03bc +\n\ni\u03ba\nF2 (q 2 )\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd q \u03bd ] uN (p1 ) ,\n2Mp\n\n(1)\n\nwhere q 2 = (p2 \u2212 p1 )2 , while \u03ba \u2261 \u03bcp \u2212 1, and Mp are the proton's magnetic moment and mass, respectively,\n\nand F1,2 (q 2 ) are normalized as F1 (0) = F2 (0) = 1. On the other hand, the Sachs' form factors GE (q 2 ) and\nGM (q 2 ) are given by\nGE (q 2 ) =\nGM (q 2 ) =\n\nF1 (q 2 ) \u2212 \u03ba \u03c4 F2 (q 2 )\nF1 (q 2 ) + \u03ba F2 (q 2 ) ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c4 = \u2212q 2 /4Mp2 \u2261 Q2 /4Mp2 , and the normalization is then GE (0) = 1, and GM (0) = \u03bcp .\nIn the very early applications of the dual-resonance model to three point functions involving more than\none form factor [10], it was not quite clear to which form factor, or linear combination of form factors,\nshould the model apply. There is no ambiguity in Dual-QCD\u221e , as this is a realization of a quantum field\ntheory. The form factors should then be those appearing in the primary hadronic spectral function, dual\nto the QCD field theory spectral function. In other words, the form factors with the correct pole structure\nsatisfying dispersion relations in the complex energy plane. In the case of the nucleon, these are the Dirac\n2\n\n\fand Pauli form factors which in QCD\u221e become\nF1,2 (s) =\n\n\u221e\nX\nC(1,2)n\n,\n2\n(M\nn \u2212 s)\nn=0\n\n(3)\n\nwhere s \u2261 q 2 , and the masses of the vector-meson zero-width resonances, Mn , as well as their couplings\nC1n and C2n , are not predicted. In Dual-QCD\u221e these are chosen so that the form factors become Beta\nfunctions (ratios of gamma-functions), i.e.\nC(1,2)n =\n\n\u0393(\u03b21,2 \u2212 1/2) (\u22121)n\n1\n\u221a\n,\n\u0393(n + 1) \u0393(\u03b21,2 \u2212 1 \u2212 n)\n\u03b1\u2032 \u03c0\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b21,2 are free parameters controlling the asymptotic behaviour in the space-like region (s < 0), and\n\u03b1\u2032 = 1/2M\u03c1 2 is the universal string tension in the rho-meson Regge trajectory\n\u03b1\u03c1 (s) = 1 + \u03b1\u2032 (s \u2212 M\u03c12 ) .\n\n(5)\n\nMn2 = M\u03c12 (1 + 2n) .\n\n(6)\n\nThe mass spectrum is chosen as [11]\n\nUsing Eqs.(4) and (6) in Eq.(3) one obtains\nF1,2 (s) =\n\n=\n\n\u221e\n1\n1\n\u0393(\u03b21,2 \u2212 1/2) X (\u22121)n\n\u221a\n\u03c0\n\u0393(n\n+\n1)\n\u0393(\u03b2\n\u2212\n1\n\u2212\nn)\n[n\n+\n1\n\u2212\n\u03b1\u03c1 (s)]\n1,2\nn=0\n\n1 \u0393(\u03b21,2 \u2212 1/2)\n\u221a\nB(\u03b21,2 \u2212 1, 1/2 \u2212 \u03b1\u2032 s) ,\n\u03c0 \u0393(\u03b21,2 \u2212 1)\n\n(7)\n\nwhere B(x,y) is Euler's Beta function. In the time-like region (s > 0) the poles of the Beta function\ncorrespond to an infinite set of zero-width resonances with equally spaced squared masses given by Eq.(5).\nIn fact, from Eq.(7) it follows\nIm F1,2 (s) =\n\n\u221e\n\u0393(\u03b21,2 \u2212 1/2) X (\u22121)n\n1\n\u221a\n\u03c0 \u03b4(Mn2 \u2212 s) .\n\u03b1\u2032 \u03c0\n\u0393(n\n+\n1)\n\u0393(\u03b2\n\u2212\n1\n\u2212\nn)\n1,2\nn=0\n\n(8)\n\nAsymptotically, the form factors in the space-like region exhibit Regge-behaviour, viz.\nlim F1,2 (s) = (\u2212\u03b1\u2032 s)(1\u2212\u03b21,2 ) ,\n\ns\u2192\u2212\u221e\n\n(9)\n\nThe free parameters \u03b21,2 can be fixed from fits to the data in the space-like region. Notice that the values\n\u03b21,2 = 2 reduce the form factors to single rho-meson dominance (naive Vector Meson Dominance). The\nmass formula Eq.(6) predicts e.g. for the first three radial excitations: M\u03c1\u2032 \u2243 1340 MeV, M\u03c1\u2032\u2032 \u2243 1720\nMeV, and M\u03c1\u2032\u2032\u2032 \u2243 2034 MeV in reasonable agreement with experiment [12] : M\u03c1\u2032 = 1465 \u00b1 25 MeV,\nM\u03c1\u2032\u2032 = 1700 \u00b1 20 MeV, and M\u03c1\u2032\u2032\u2032 = 2149 \u00b1 17 MeV. Alternative (non-linear) mass formulas might be\nrequired if one were to match the asymptotic Regge behaviour to the Operator Product Expansion of\ncurrent correlators at short distances [13]. However, the differences in the values of the first few masses\n3\n\n\fare at the level of a few percent. Hence, the form factors would hardly be affected, since the contribution\nfrom high mass states is factorially suppressed.\n\nHistorically, the Sachs form factors were first determined from measurements of elastic electron-proton\nscattering cross sections (Rosenbluth technique) [14]. Direct extractions of GE (q 2 ) and GM (q 2 ) up to\n\u2212q 2 \u2261 Q2 \u2243 7 GeV2 indicated the empirical approximate scaling relation: \u03bcp GE (q 2 )/GM (q 2 ) \u2243 1. At\n\nhigher values of Q2 , the contribution of GE (q 2 ) to the cross section is kinematically suppressed. On the\n\nother hand, recent electron-proton polarization transfer measurements at Jefferson Lab (JLab) [15] up to\nQ2 \u2243 6 GeV2 show a considerable deviation from this scaling behaviour, except possibly at very small\n\nQ2 [16]. After some debate about the source of the discrepancy between cross-section (Rosenbluth) and\npolarization transfer extractions of the form factors [17], it appears that the culprit is the two-photon\nexchange correction [18]. We assume this to be the case, and adopt the experimental data on the Sachs\nform factors as corrected in [19]. These corrections are made in order to bring the Rosenbluth data into\nagreement with the polarization transfer data on the ratio \u03bcp GE (q 2 )/GM (q 2 ). We then use Eq.(2) to\nobtain data points for F1 (q 2 ) and F2 (q 2 ). After fitting this data base with Eq.(7) we find \u03b21 = 3.03, and\n\u03b22 = 4.20. Figures 1, and 2 show the results of the fits for F1 (q 2 ), and F2 (q 2 ), corresponding to these values\nof \u03b21,2 , together with the corrected data points of [19]. In Fig. 3 we show GM (q 2 ), as obtained from Eq.(2)\nusing the fitted F1,2 (q 2 ), together with the same data base. As can be appreciated, the agreement between\nEq.(7) and the data is very good. Having fitted a data base corrected to account for the polarization\ntransfer data on the ratio \u03bcp GE (q 2 )/GM (q 2 ), we would expect our theoretical form factors to lead to a\nratio in agreement with experiment. While this is the case, it turns out that this ratio is very sensitive\nto the pair of values \u03b21 \u2212 \u03b22 , with a strong correlation between them. In Fig. 4 we show the theoretical\n\nprediction of the ratio \u03bcp GE (q 2 )/GM (q 2 ) corresponding to \u03b21 = 3.0 and \u03b22 = 4.2, together with the JLab\n\ndata [15]. Small variations of these parameters lead to correlated pairs resulting in equally good fits, e.g.\nthe pair \u03b21 = 2.95 and \u03b22 = 4.13 leads to an almost identical theoretical prediction. Exploring the \u03b21 -\u03b22\nparameter space, and performing a combined fit to F1 (q 2 ), F2 (q 2 ), and the ratio \u03bcp GE (q 2 )/GM (q 2 ) gives\n\u03b21\n\u03b22\n\n= 2.95 \u2212 3.03\n= 4.13 \u2212 4.20 .\n\n(10)\n\nThe mean-squared electromagnetic radii that follow from Eq.(7) are given by\n2\n< r1,2\n>= 6 \u03b1\u2032 [\u03c8(\u03b21,2 \u2212 1/2) \u2212 \u03c8(1/2)] ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03c8(x) is the digamma function. Using the results from Eq.(10) in Eq. (11) gives < r12 >1/2 = 0.72 f m,\n2\nand < r22 >1/2 = 0.78 f m. From Eq.(2), these radii lead to the Sachs radii < rE\n>1/2 = 0.81 f m, and\n2\n< rM\n>1/2 = 0.76 f m. These values are in reasonable agreement with various other results in the literature\n\n4\n\n\f[20], especially taking into account that the free parameters \u03b21,2 have been fixed from the large-Q2 data,\n2\nwhile the form factors decrease by 3-4 orders of magnitude in the range 0 \u2264 Q2 <\n\u223c 30 GeV . It should also\nbe kept in mind that the strong deviation from unity of the ratio \u03bcp GE (q 2 )/GM (q 2 ) might affect existing\nextractions of the Sachs radii from data.\nIn summary, the nucleon form factors F1 (q 2 ), and F2 (q 2 ) obtained in the framework of Dual-QCD\u221e\nreproduce very nicely the experimental data in the space-like region, as corrected in [19], in the wide\n2\n2\nrange 0 \u2264 Q2 <\n\u223c 30 GeV . The Sachs magnetic form factor, GM (q ), as well as the non-trivial ratio\n\u03bcp GE (q 2 )/GM (q 2 ) can also be accounted for in this framework. These results provide strong support for\n\nDual-QCD\u221e as a viable realization of QCD in the large Nc limit.\nAcknowledgements\nOne of us (CAD) wishes to thank F.
