The most nearby active galaxy Cen A has attracted considerable attention as a detected TeV gamma-ray and possible ultrahigh energy (UHE) cosmic-ray emitter.\nAims. We investigate the efficiency of particle acceleration close to the supermassive black hole (BH) horizon assuming that accretion\nin the innermost part of the disk occurs in an advection-dominated (ADAF) mode.\nMethods.

We show that for an underluminous source such as Cen A, centrifugally accelerated electrons may reach Lorentz factors of\nup to \u03b3 \u223c (107 \u2212 108 ), allowing inverse Compton (Thomson) upscattering of ADAF sub-mm disk photons into the TeV regime with\nan associated maximum (isotropic) luminosity of the order of a few times 1039 erg/s. Upscattering of Comptonized disk photons is\nexpected to lead to a TeV spectrum L\u03bd \u221d \u03bd\u2212\u03b1c with a spectral index \u03b1c \u2243 (1.5\u22121.9), consistent with H.E.S.S. results.

We argue that if Cen A is indeed an extreme UHECR emitting source, then shear acceleration along the kpc-scale jet could\nrepresent one of the most promising mechanisms capable of pushing protons up to energies beyond 50 EeV.\nKey words. galaxies: active \u2013 galaxies: jets \u2013 radiation mechanism: non-thermal \u2013 gamma rays: theory \u2013 individual: Cen A\n\n1. Introduction\nCentaurus A (NGC 5128, Cen A) is the closest (distance d \u223c 3.4\nMpc; Israel 1998) and one of the best studied active galaxies.\nOptically, Cen A is an elliptical galaxy undergoing late stages\nof a merger event with a small spiral galaxy. Radio observations detected a complex FR I morphology with a subparsecscale jet and counter-jet, a one-sided kiloparsec-scale jet, two\nradio lobes and extended diffusive emission. VLBI observations\nof the subparsec-scale jet indicate that Cen A is a non-blazar\nsource with a jet inclination angle i >\u223c 50\u25e6 (Tingay et al. 1998),\nor perhaps somewhat smaller if large-scale observations are reliable tracers (Hardcastle et al. 2003). The center of its activity is\na supermassive black hole (BH) with a mass inferred to be in the\nrange mBH \u2243 (0.5 \u2212 1.2) \u00d7 108 M\u2299 (Marconi et al. 2006; H\u00e4ringNeumayer et al. 2006), corresponding to a Schwarzschild scale\nr s \u2243 (1.5 \u2212 3.6) \u00d7 1013 cm.\nCen A is the only AGN of the non-blazar type detected at MeV\n(COMPTEL: Steinle et al. 1998) and GeV energies (EGRET:\nSreekumar et al. 1999). The nuclear spectral energy distribution\n(SED) of Cen A, as inferred from non-simultaneous data, appears to consist of two peaks, one reaching its maximum at several times 1013 Hz and one peaking around 0.1 MeV (Chiaberge\net al. 2001; Meisenheimer et al. 2007). The SED below 1 GeV\nhas been successfully modeled within a simple jet synchrotron\nself-Compton (SSC) framework, assuming Cen A to be a misaligned BL Lac object (Chiaberge et al. 2001). In the early days\nof gamma-ray astronomy, a tentative detection (> 4\u03c3) of Cen A\nSend offprint requests to: F.M. Rieger\n\nat very high energies > 0.3 TeV was reported during a phase of\nhigh X-ray activity in 1972-1974 (Grindlay 1975). H.E.S.S. results (Aharonian et al. 2009a) have established Cen A as a TeV\nemitting source (the second radio galaxy after M87) with integral VHE flux of \u223c 1% of the Crab Nebula.\nChandra and XMM-Newton observations between 2 and 7 keV\nindicate that the nuclear X-ray continuum spectrum in Cen A\nmay consist of both a disk and a jet component, the disk contribution being consistent with a hybrid disk configuration where a\nstandard disk is truncated at rt and replaced by an ADAF in the\ninner regions close to the central black hole (Evans et al. 2004;\ncf. also Pellegrini et al. 2005 and Meisenheimer et al. 2007). A\ntransition to an inner ADAF disk could also explain the lack of\na big blue bump UV feature expected in the standard disk scenario (Marconi et al. 2001). The accretion rate for Cen A seems\nuncertain by about an order of magnitude, with model-dependent\nestimates ranging from several 10\u22124 to some 10\u22123 \u1e41Edd . Taking\nthe measured nuclear X-ray luminosity of L x \u223c 5 \u00d7 1041 erg/s\n(Evans et al. 2004) as a robust upper limit to a possible ADAF\ndisk contribution gives \u1e41 <\u223c 0.004\u1e41Edd, which for the canonical\nviscosity parameter \u03b1 \u2243 0.3 is still below the critical mass accretion rate \u1e41crit \u2243 0.3 \u03b12 \u1e41Edd required for a two-temperature\nADAF to occur (Narayan et al. 1998; Yi 1999).\nIf the first SED peak below 1014 Hz is indeed caused by\nsynchrotron emission from the jet (Chiaberge et al. 2001;\nMeisenheimer et al. 2007), inverse Compton upscattering in a\nconventional homogeneous SSC framework is unable to account\nfor VHE \u03b3-rays in the TeV regime. On the other hand, it could\nbe that the situation for Cen A is similar to that for M 87, where\n\n\f2\n\nF.M. Rieger and F.A. Aharonian: Cen A as TeV \u03b3-ray and possible UHE cosmic-ray source\n\nefficient particle acceleration close to the BH horizon seems to\nbe responsible for the production of the observed TeV \u03b3-rays\n(Aharonian et al. 2009b; Rieger & Aharonian 2008a, henceforth:\nRA08a). Here we analyze possible VHE characteristics associated with this scenario. We show that for parameters inferred\nfrom observations, inverse Compton upscattering of ADAF disk\nphotons by centrifugally accelerated electrons could result in\nvariable (\u223c 1 hr) VHE \u03b3-rays with a relatively hard TeV spectrum. We show that the mechanism considered is unable to accelerate protons to ultra high energy cosmic-ray (UHECR) energies, although shear acceleration along the jet could potentially\nprovide a means.\n\n2. Cen A as a TeV \u03b3-ray source\n2.1. Particle acceleration close to the BH horizon\n\nMagnetic fields are widely considered to play a key role in the\nformation of collimated relativistic outflows from compact objects. According to, e.g., MHD scenarios, magnetic flux dragged\nin by the accretion flow and suitably amplified by dynamo actions in the inner accretion disk can build up a rigidly rotating\n(quasi-dipolar) disk magnetosphere. Depending on the field-line\nrotation and the current distribution, the bulk of the plasma may\nthen be centrifugally accelerated along open flux surfaces to relativistic speeds (\u0393b \u223c 10) and become collimated outside the light\ncylinder rL \u2243 (5 \u2212 10) r s (e.g., Camenzind 1995; Fendt 1997).\nIn what follows, we explore an approach where efficient particle acceleration is supposed to occur close to the light cylinder\n(e.g., Machabeli & Rogava 1994; Gangadhara & Lesch 1997;\nRieger & Mannheim 2000; Osmanov et al. 2007). Within the\nMHD framework this could occur if, e.g., the longitudinal current becomes smaller than a critical value (Beskin & Rafikov\n2000). Let us suppose, thus, that a significant fraction of the\nelectromagnetic energy may be transformed into the kinetic energy of particles by means of magneto-centrifugal effects close\nto rL . Consider for illustration a charged test particle, corotating\nwith the magnetic field and gaining energy while moving outwards (Machabeli & Rogava 1994). The motion of this particle\nmay be analyzed conveniently in the framework of Hamiltonian\ndynamics: For length scales much smaller than the curvature radius of the field, the field topology is monopole-like and the associated Hamiltonian H for a particle of rest mass m0 moving\nalong a relativistically, rigidly rotating field-line (angular velocity \u03a9 = c/rL = constant) becomes a constant of motion\nH = \u03b3 m0 c2 (1 \u2212 r2 /rL2 ) = const. ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b3 = (1 \u2212 r2 /rL2 \u2212 \u1e592 /c2 )\u22121/2 is the particle Lorentz factor.\nThus, as a particle approaches rL , its Lorentz factor might increase dramatically (provided corotation holds; however, it cannot become infinite, see below). Using Eq. (1) and the definition\nof \u03b3, this can be expressed in terms of a characteristic (minimum)\nacceleration timescale (cf. RA08a)\ntacc =\n\n\u03b3\n1\n,\n\u2243\n\u03b3\u0307 2 \u03a9 m\u03031/4 \u03b31/2\n\n(2)\n\nvalid for \u03b3 \u226b 1, where m\u0303 = 1/(\u03b302 [1 \u2212 r02 /rL2 ]2 ) depends on the\ninitial injection conditions.\n2.2. Constraints on achievable Lorentz factors\n\nUnder realistic astrophysical conditions, the acceleration efficiency is constrained by radiation reaction (e.g., inverse\n\nCompton in the ambient photon field), the breakdown of the\nbead-on-the-wire (BW) approximation for a single particle or\nthe bending of the field line with increasing inertia. For a mass\naccretion rate in the concordant range (2 \u2212 20) \u00d7 10\u22124 \u1e41Edd\n(e.g., Marconi et al. 2001; Evans et al. 2004; Pellegrini 2005;\nMeisenheimer et al. 2007), the ADAF equipartition magnetic\n\u22125.4 1/2\n\u1e41 (Yi 1999) becomes Beq (3 r s ) >\u223c 500\nfield Beq \u221d m\u22121/2\nBH r\nG, suggesting (radial) jet magnetic field strengths near the light\ncylinder of B(rL ) >\u223c 50 G. In the case of BL Lac objects, transition radii from tens to several hundred r s have been inferred from\nobservations (e.g., Cao 2003; Wu & Cao 2005). Similarly, the\napparent lack of a standard disk feature in the observed SED of\nCen A seems to indicate as well that rt > 10 r s . By assuming that\nall of the measured X-ray luminosity in Cen A of L x \u223c 5 \u00d7 1041\nerg/s is produced by an inner ADAF, the implied energy densities is Uph \u223c L x /(4\u03c0 rt2c) <\u223c 1 erg/cm3 for rt >\u223c 30 r s . A similar\nconstraint might be obtained based on the ADAF synchrotron\n4/5 7/5\n\u03bd s (Yi 1999) close to\npeak luminosity LR \u223c \u03bd s L\u03bds \u221d m6/5\nBH \u1e41\n11\nrL , where \u03bd s (rL ) \u2243 7 \u00d7 10 Hz, which give LR \u223c 3 \u00d7 1039 erg/s,\nusing the fiducial parameters \u1e41 = 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u1e41Edd , mBH = 108 M\u2299 ,\nand rL \u223c 5 r s (giving B(rL ) \u223c 100 G), implying a photon energy\ndensity Uph \u223c 0.4 erg/cm3.\n(i) Inverse Compton losses (Thomson regime) for electrons, occurring on timescales of tcool \u2243 3\u00d7107/[\u03b3 Uph ] s, then imply (see\nEq.

Expected TeV characteristics\n\nThe above considerations suggest that electron acceleration\nclose to the central BH in Cen A may produce Lorentz factors \u03b3 \u223c 107 . This would allow Thomson inverse Compton\nupscattering of ambient disk photons to TeV energies of \u01eb \u223c\n\u03b3me c2 \u2243 5 (\u03b3/107) TeV. The resultant TeV spectral index at the\nhigh energy end then traces, over a decade or so, the underlying\ndisk seed photon spectrum (Rieger & Aharonian 2008b). In the\nADAF case, comptonization of thermal synchrotron soft photons\nis expected to lead to a power-law-like tail in the disk spectrum\nabove \u03bd s , i.e., L\u03bd \u2243 L\u03bds (\u03bd/\u03bd s )\u2212\u03b1c , where \u03b1c = \u2212 ln \u03c4esc / ln A depends on the accretion rate (Mahadevan 1997; Yi 1999). For the\ninferred mass accretion rate of Cen A, \u1e41 \u2243 (2 \u2212 20) \u00d7 10\u22124 \u1e41Edd ,\nthe spectral index becomes \u03b1c \u2243 (1.2 \u2212 1.9) assuming a standard\nADAF viscosity coefficient \u03b1 = 0.3. This suggests that the upscattered TeV spectrum in Cen A might in fact be softer than that\nobserved in M87 (see Aharonian et al. 2006). A spectral fit to the\nVHE (> 300 GeV) data obtained by H.E.S.S. indeed suggests a\npower-law spectral index in the range 1.7 \u00b1 0.5 (Aharonian et al.\n2009a). A soft spectrum with, e.g., \u03b1c = 1.8, may then indicate\n\n\fF.M. Rieger and F.A. Aharonian: Cen A as TeV \u03b3-ray and possible UHE cosmic-ray source\n\nthat accretion occurs at the lower end of the concordant interval noted above. Since particle acceleration occurs close to the\nlight surface, the expected minimum TeV variability timescale is\n\u223c rL /c \u223c 1 hour.\nIs it possible that TeV photons, produced by inverse Compton\nupscattering, can escape from the vicinity of the central black\nhole in Cen A? In principle, photons of energy E [TeV] will interact most efficiently with target photons in the infrared regime,\ni.e., of energy \u01ebIR \u2243 (1 TeV/E) eV. For the radio luminosity LR\nestimated above, the implied infrared (1 eV) ADAF disk luminosity is on the order of LIR \u223c 3 \u00d7 1039 (300)1\u2212\u03b1c erg/s. The\noptical depth for \u03b3\u03b3-absorption \u03c4\u03b3\u03b3 \u2243 (LIR \u03c3\u03b3\u03b3 )/(4\u03c0RIR\u01ebIR c) thus\nbecomes\n!\n!\n4\nrL \u0012 E \u0013\nLIR\n\u03c4\u03b3\u03b3 (E, RIR ) \u223c\n,\n(5)\n300\u03b1c \u22121 3 \u00d7 1039 erg/s RIR 1 TeV\nindicating that TeV photons may well escape from the vicinity\nof the black hole provided the spectrum is sufficiently soft (i.e.,\nfor \u03b1 >\u223c 1.4). The nuclear (pc-scale) region of Cen A, on the other\nhand, is known to be relatively mid-infrared-bright (with luminosity of \u223c 7 \u00d7 1041 erg/s). Yet, if this flux is indeed dominated\nby emission from a dusty torus of size >\u223c 0.1 pc (see Radomski et\nal. 2008), VHE gamma-rays would also be able to escape unabsorbed from the nuclear region of Cen A.\nOne can estimate the maximum possible TeV luminosity output LIC \u223c \u03c1 n Pc \u2206V based on the Alfv\u00e9n corotation condition\nB2 /8\u03c0 \u2265 n\u03b3me c2 , which provides an upper limit for the accelerated particle number density close to rL . By noting that for the\nrelevant volume one has \u2206V = 4\u03c0(\u03b30 /\u03b3)rL3 , that Pc can be approximated by the single particle Thomson power, and that particles are accumulated for \u03c1 = tcool /tacc \u2265 1 (correcting a typo\nin RA08a, eq. 12), the maximum possible inverse Compton TeV\nluminosity is of order\n!2 \u0012\n\u00132 \u0012 \u03b3 \u00131/2 107 !1/2\nrL\n0\n39 B(rL )\nLTeV\n\u223c\n10\nerg/s ,\nIC\n50G\n10\n\u03b3\n1.5 \u00d7 1014 cm\n(6)\nwhich is consistent with the H.E.S.S. results of Aharonian et\nal. (2009a). Since LIC increases almost linearly with black hole\nmass, a source needs to be sufficiently massive to become detectable by current ground-based instruments. In fact, under\nnormal conditions (i.e., for moderate injection Lorentz factors\n\u03b30 \u223c 10), the inferred TeV output for Cen A is close to the sensitivity limit (1% of the Crab flux, with 5\u03c3 in 50h) of the H.E.S.S.\narray. Variability studies on hour timescale will thus only be possible with the next-generation CTA telescope project.\n\n3. On Cen A as a possible UHECR proton source\nAccording to the Pierre Auger results, 4 out of 27 events detected above 57 EeV may be associated with the location of\nCen A (Abraham et al. 2007, 2008). If some of these cosmic ray\nevents were indeed associated with Cen A, it seems unlikely that\ntheir energization could occur close to the central BH. Neither\na Blandford-Znajek-type nor a centrifugal disk wind scenario\nseems to allow for that: For example, if the black hole in Cen\nA rotates and is embedded in a magnetic field of equipartition\nstrength B0 <\u223c 104 (\u1e41/10\u22122 \u1e41Edd )1/2 (108 M\u2299 /mBH )1/2 G, it could\nact as a unipolar inductor (membrane paradigm) and induce a\nvoltage difference of the order of\n! \u0012\nmBH\nB0 \u0013\n19\n\u03a6 \u223c 4 \u00d7 10 Za\nV.\n(7)\n108 M\u2299\n104 G\n\n3\n\nHowever in reality, it seems unlikely that protons might be able\nto fully tap this potential. Even if the ordered magnetic field\ncomponent could be as high as B0 , screening of the electric field\nin the plasma-rich AGN environment and curvature losses, for\nexample, are readily expected to reduce achievable proton energies to below \u223c 1019 eV (cf. Levinson 2000; Aharonian et\nal. 2002). Moreover, as an FR I source, Cen A is most likely\ncharacterized by a Kerr parameter a well below one (e.g., Daly\n2009). Centrifugal acceleration of particles in the rotating disk\nmagnetosphere, on the other hand, is limited by the condition\nfor single particle corotation, cf. Eq. (4). While this works well\nfor electrons, efficient centrifugal acceleration of protons to energies far beyond 1017 eV is unlikely to occur in the vicinity of\nthe central BH. We finally note, that the required Lorentz factors\nof \u03b3 p >\u223c 5 \u00d7 1010 (if assumed to be protons) would already imply\na gyro-radius rgyro \u2243 1.5 \u00d7 1015 (\u03b3 p /5 \u00d7 1010 ) (100 G/B(rL )) cm,\nexceeding the characteristic light cylinder scale for Cen A.\nFurthermore, if radio observations are a reliable tracer of the true\nfluid speeds in the jet of Cen A, internal shocks are also probably\nnot able to account for UHECRs beyond 50 EeV. On both VLBA\nsubparsec-scales and VLA scales of hundreds of parsecs, the jet\nbulk speed seems to be at most mildly relativistic, not exceeding 0.5c by much (Tingay et al. 2001; Hardcastle et al. 2003).\nIf the shocks are internal with characteristic speeds comparable to the relative velocity between layers, shock speeds \u03b2 s well\nbelow 0.5c are expected. Balancing the minimum timescale for\nnon-relativistic shock acceleration (Bohm limit, e.g. see Rieger\net al. 2007) with the timescale for cross-field diffusion then implies, that possible cosmic ray energies are limited to Emax \u2243\nZ e B rt \u03b2 s , where rt is the (transverse) source size and B the local magnetic field strength. Even if one would allow for some local magnetic field amplification by a factor \u03c1 (e.g., due to shock\ncompression or shear-driven instabilities) and assume that radiative losses could be neglected, possible proton energies are unlikely to exceed\n\u0012 B \u0013 \u0012 \u03b2 \u0013\n0\ns\nEmax <\u223c 2 \u00d7 1019 \u03c14\neV ,\n(8)\n0.1 c\n104 G\nwhere the strength of the local field at r \u223c rt /\u03b1 j (where \u03b1 j is\nthe jet opening angle) has been expressed as B \u2243 \u03c1B0 (r s /r),\n\u03c14 = \u03c1/4, with e.g., \u03c14 = 1 for a strong shock-compressed downstream region. While it seems thus unlikely that protons can be\naccelerated to 50 EeV and beyond (at least if no dramatic flaring\nactivity is assumed, cf. Dermer et al. 2009), acceleration to the\nankle at \u223c 4 \u00d7 1018 eV might well be possible.\nHardcastle et al. (2009) recently proposed that efficient stochastic particle acceleration could occur in the giant radio lobes of\nCen A on scales of R \u223c 100 kpc. In the Bohm limit, the characteristic acceleration timescale for stochastic second order Fermi\nacceleration is of order tacc \u2243 (c/vA )2 (rgyro /c) (e.g., Rieger et al.\n2007). Comparing this timescale with that for cross-field diffusion, i.e., tdf \u223c 3R2 /(crgyro ), suggests that proton energies are\nlimited to\n! \u0012\n\u0012 v \u0013\nR\nB \u0013\nA\nEmax \u2243 1.6 \u00d7 1019\neV .\n(9)\n0.1 c\n100 kpc\n10\u22126 G\nHence, if relativistic turbulent wave speeds can be achieved (of\norder vA \u2243 0.3c, as assumed in Hardcastle et al. 2009), proton\nacceleration to energies 5 \u00d7 1019 eV could become possible. Yet,\nwhether these conditions exist, seems unclear (cf. O'Sullivan et\nal. 2009). If (part of) the observed X-ray emission from the giant\nlobes is produced by thermal plasma emission, the implied thermal plasma density would be of order nth \u223c (10\u22125 \u2212 10\u22124 ) cm\u22123 ,\n\n\f4\n\nF.M. Rieger and F.A. Aharonian: Cen A as TeV \u03b3-ray and possible UHE cosmic-ray source\n\ni.e., much higher than conducive to fast Alfv\u00e9nic turbulence. For\ntypical equipartition field strengths\nof B \u223c 10\u22126 G, the characterp\nistic Alfv\u00e9n speed vA \u2243 B/ 4\u03c0 nth m p <\u223c c/500 would be much\nlower than required.\nBased on the above considerations, it seems questionable\nwhether protons could indeed be accelerated to energies beyond 1019 eV in Cen A. However, one possible mechanism that\nmay help particles to reach beyond this limit could be shear\nacceleration along the large-scale jet (Rieger & Duffy 2004).\nStrong internal jet stratification (e.g., a fast spine surrounded\nby slower moving layers) is naturally expected for jets interacting with their environments or launched by different processes (e.g., disk and black-hole driven wind), and indeed seen\nin hydrodynamical simulations (e.g., Meliani & Keppens 2007;\nAloy & Mimica 2008). In the case of Cen A, there are some\nobservational hints, e.g., limb-brightening in the X-ray jet, the\nhigher energy emission being more confined to the jet axis,\nlongitudinal magnetic field polarization in the large-scale jet\n(Kataoka et al. 2006; Kraft et al. 2002; Hardcastle et al. 2003)\nthat might be indicative of internal jet stratification. Energetic\nparticles scattered across such a shear flow can sample the kinetic difference in the flow and be accelerated to higher energies. The timescale for particle acceleration in a continuous\nshear flow is inversely proportional to the particle mean free\npath tacc \u221d 1/\u03bb (Rieger & Duffy 2004). In order to compete\nwith radiative losses, and in the case of Cen A with advection\nalong the jet, high energy seed particles are thus needed to ensure efficient particle acceleration. Assuming a gyro-dependent\nparticle mean free path \u03bb \u223c rgyro , the minimum acceleration time\nscale in a linearly decreasing velocity shear profile is on the order of tacc \u2243 3(\u2206r)2 c/[\u03bb \u03b3b4 (\u2206vz )2 ] \u223c 6 (\u2206r)2 /(rgyro c) assuming\nvz \u223c 0.5c (see Rieger & Duffy 2004). Advection along the jet\noccurs on a characteristic timescale ta \u223c l j /vz \u223c 1012 sec, where\nl j \u223c 4.5 kpc is the (projected) X-ray jet length (Hardcastle et\nal. 2007). The observed kpc radio jet slightly expands and has a\ntransverse width of \u223c 1 kpc close to its end (Kraft et al. 2002).\nProtons injected at the crossover to the kpc-scales, for example,\nwould thus need seed energies of E \u223c (1 \u2212 5) \u00d7 1018 eV to ensure that shear acceleration can operate efficiently (using, e.g.,\n\u2206r \u223c 0.2 kpc, B \u223c 10\u22124 G). Such energetic seed particles may\nwell be provided by e.g. shock acceleration. In this case, protons\nescaping from the inner shock region and diffusing into the outer\nshear layers will naturally experience an additional increase in\nenergy. In 3d-hydrodynamical simulations (Aloy et al. 1999),\nthe shear layer is found to broaden with distance along the jet,\neventually becoming comparable to the beam width. If one thus\ntakes \u2206r \u223c 1 kpc near to the jet end (we note that the full width\nof the turbulent shear layer may be even larger than that seen\nin the radio), the classical Hillas confinement condition would\nconstrain maximum protons energies to be E \u2243 1020 (B/10\u22124G)\neV. This value might be somewhat higher, if the magnetic field\nis amplified in the shear (e.g., due to Kelvin-Helmholtz-driven\nshear instabilities, see Zhang et al. 2009). On the other hand, for\nsmaller transverse shear widths, non-gradual shear acceleration\n(Ostrowski 1998; Rieger & Duffy 2004) is expected to take over\nearlier, leading to similar maximum energy considerations but\ndifferent spectral characteristics.\n\n4. Conclusions\nIf Cen A hosts a radiatively inefficient inner accretion disk, efficient electron acceleration in its BH-jet magnetosphere and inverse Compton upscattering of ambient disk photons to the TeV\nregime appears to be possible. After M87, Cen A could thus be\n\nanother primary candidate source in which VHE processes close\nto the black hole may allow a fundamental diagnosis of its immediate environment, offering important insights into the central\nengine in AGNs.\nWhether Cen A indeed proves to be an UHECR emitting source\nmay require confirmation by additional observations. From a\ntheoretical point of view and based on conventional acceleration concepts, it seems challenging to account for a possible production of UHECR protons beyond 1019 eV. On the other hand,\nas shown above, shear acceleration along the large-scale jet in\nCen A may help to overcome this problem by increasing the energy of shock-accelerated seed particles by a factor of some tens.\nIf this would be the case, spectral changes in the cosmic ray spectrum might be partly due to the operation of a new acceleration\nmechanism and not simply propagation effects.\nAcknowledgements.
