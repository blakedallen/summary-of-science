This\nis a fundamental question in many areas, such as operations research, number theory, and\nstatistics. In terms of optimization, this is called an integer feasibility problem. A generalized\ninteger feasibility problem is to find b such that there does not exist a nonnegative integral\nsolution in the system with a given A. One such problem is the well-known Frobenius\nproblem. In this paper we study the generalized integer feasibility problem and also the\nmulti-dimensional Frobenius problem. To study a family of systems with no nonnegative\ninteger solution, we focus on a commutative semigroup generated by a finite subset of Zd\nand its saturation. An element in the difference of the semigroup and its saturation is called\na \"hole\". We show the necessary and sufficient conditions for the finiteness of the set of holes.\nAlso we define fundamental holes and saturation points of a commutative semigroup.

As examples we consider some three- and fourway contingency tables from statistics and apply our results to them. Then we will discuss\nthe time complexities of our algorithms.\n\nKey words and phrases: contingency tables, data security, Frobenius problem, indispensable move, Markov basis, monoid, Hilbert basis, linear integer feasibility problem, saturation, semigroup\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nConsider the following system of linear equations and inequalities:\nAx = b, x \u2265 0,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere A \u2208 Zd\u00d7n and b \u2208 Zd . Suppose the solution set {x \u2208 Rn : Ax = b, x \u2265 0} =\n6 \u2205. The\nlinear integer feasibility problem is to ask whether the system in (1) has an integral solution or\n1\n\n\fnot. A generalized integer feasibility problem is to find all b such that there does not exist a\nnonnegative integral solution in the system with a given A. Note that there exists an integral\nsolution for the system in (1) if and only if b is in the semigroup generated by the column vectors\nof A. From this, we can write this problem as follows.\nProblem 1.1. Let a1 , . . . , an \u2208 Zd be columns of A and\nQ = Q(A) = {a1 x1 + * * * + an xn : x1 , . . . , xn \u2208 Z+ }\n\n(2)\n\nbe the set of all nonnegative integer combinations of a1 , . . . , an or in other words the semigroup\ngenerated by a1 , . . . , an . Compute a finite representation of all vectors of Q.\nBarvinok and Woods (2003) introduced an algorithm to encode all vectors in the semigroup\nQ into a generating function as a short rational generating function in polynomial time when d\nand n are fixed. Therefore, using this algorithm one can compute a finite representation of all\nvectors not in Q in polynomial time if we fix d and n. However, their algorithm is yet technically\ndifficult to implement so that we do not know whether it is practical or not. Modifying Problem\n1.1, in this paper, we would like to solve the following problem.\nProblem 1.2. Let Q be defined as in Problem 1.1. Decide whether there is a finite number of\nintegral vectors not in Q but in its saturation.\nIn other words, for fixed A, decide whether there is a finite number of integral vectors b \u2208 Zd\nsuch that the system in (1) has a nonnegative rational solution but not a nonnegative integral\nsolution.\nIntensive research has been carried out on integer feasibility problems. In 1972, Karp (1972)\nshowed that solving the integer linear feasibility problem is NP hard. In the 1980's, H.W.\nLenstra, Jr. developed an algorithm to detect integer solutions in the system (1) using the\nLLL-algorithm [Gr\u00f6tschel et al. (1993); Lenstra (1983)]. Lenstra also showed that integer programming problems with a fixed number of variables can be solved in time polynomial in the\ninput size. The algorithm was actually developed in order to prove that the integer feasibility\nproblem can be solved in polynomial time if the dimension is fixed. A later algorithm of similar\nstructure, by Lov\u00e1sz and Scarf (1992), was implemented by Cook et al. (1993). In addition,\nAardal and collaborators [Aardal and Lenstra (2002); Aardal et al. (2002, 2000)] have used the\nLLL-procedure to rewrite a system of linear equations into an equivalent system that was easier\nto solve with the branch-and-bound method for testing integer feasibility. In the 1990's, based\non work by the geometers Brion, Khovanski, Lawrence, and Pukhlikov, Barvinok discovered an\nalgorithm to count integer points in rational polytopes, and this algorithm also runs in polynomial time if we fix the dimension [Barvinok (1994); Barvinok and Pommersheim (1999)]. The\nidea of the algorithm is to encode all the integer solutions for the system in (1) into a rational\ngenerating function.\nIn recent years, the generalized integer linear feasibility problem has found applications in\nmany research areas, such as number theory and statistics. One such problem is the well-known\n2\n\n\fFrobenius problem, that is, for d = 1 and relatively prime positive integers a1 , . . . , an , it is to\nfind the biggest positive integer b such that there does not exist an integral solution in (1)\n[Aardal and Lenstra (2002)]. Equivalently, it is to find the smallest positive integer b\u2032 such that\nthere exists an integral solution with b = b\u2032 + b\u0304 for any b\u0304 \u2208 Z+ in (1).\n\nSince Georg Frobenius\n\nfocused on this problem, it attracted substantial attention over more than a hundred years (see\n[Alfonsin (2006)] for a nice survey). We can generalize the Frobenius problem to the multidimensional case. Let a1 , . . . , an \u2208 Zd such that the lattice L generated by them is Zd . Let\nK = cone(a1 , . . . , an ) be the cone generated by a1 , . . . , an and let Q in (2) be the semigroup\ngenerated by a1 , . . . , an . Let S = {b \u2208 Q : b + (K \u2229 L) \u2282 Q}. In [Miller and Sturmfels (2005)],\na vector b \u2208 S is called a saturation point in Q. We ask to find \"minimal\" elements of S. In the\nmulti-dimensional version of the Frobenius problem, the notion of minimality can be defined in\nseveral ways. We present three definitions of minimality and show finiteness results of the set\nof the minimal elements of S for each definition.\nIn statistics, one can find an application in the data security problem of multi-way contingency tables [Dobra et al. (2003)]. The 3-dimensional integer planar transportation problem\n(3-DIPTP) is an integer feasibility problem which asks whether there exists a three dimensional\ncontingency table with the given 2-marginals or not. (In graph theory, a graph is called planar\nif it can be drawn in a plane without graph edges crossing.) For more details on the 3-DIPTP,\nsee [Cox (2002)]. Vlach (1986) provides an excellent summary of attempts on 3-DIPTP.\nThe linear integer feasibility problem is also closely related to the theory of Markov bases\n[Diaconis and Sturmfels (1998)] for sampling contingency tables with given marginals by Markov\nchain Monte Carlo methods. The notion of indispensable moves of Markov bases was defined in [Takemura and Aoki (2004)] and further studied in [Ohsugi and Hibi (2005)]. Recently\nOhsugi and Hibi (2006) gave a simple explicit method to construct infeasible equations of (1)\nfrom non-squarefree indispensable moves of Markov bases. One finds more details in a discussion\nof three-way tables in Section 5.\nIn Section 2 we define saturation points and then we will state our main theorem, Theorem\n2.5, which shows the simultaneous finiteness of the set of holes, which is the difference between\nthe semigroup and its saturation, the set of non-saturation points of the semigroup, and the set\nof generators for saturation points. In Section 3, we show the necessary and sufficient condition\nfor the finiteness of the set of holes. Section 4 shows a proof of Theorem 2.5. Section 5 contains\nvarious computational results for three- and four-way contingency tables. Section 6 will discuss\nthat (1) solving Problem 1.1, (2) solving Problem 1.2, (3) computing the set of holes, and (4)\ncomputing the set of fundamental holes are polynomial time in fixed d and n.\n\n2\n\nNotation and the main theorem\n\nIn this section we will remind the reader of some definitions and we will set appropriate notation.\nWe follow the notation in Chapter 7 of [Miller and Sturmfels (2005)] and [Sturmfels (1996)]. Let\n3\n\n\fA \u2208 Zd\u00d7n and let a1 , . . . , an denote the columns of A. Let N = Z+ = {0, 1, . . .}.\nDefinition 2.1. Let Q in (2) be the semigroup generated by a1 , . . . , an , let K = cone(a1 , . . . , an )\nbe the cone generated by a1 , . . . , an , and let L be the lattice generated by a1 , . . . , an . Then the\nsemigroup Qsat = K \u2229 L is called the saturation of the semigroup Q. Q \u2282 Qsat and we call Q\nsaturated if Q = Qsat (also this is called normal). H = Qsat \\ Q is the set of holes. a \u2208 Q is\ncalled a saturation point if a + Qsat \u2282 Q.\nWe assume L = Zd without loss of generality for our theoretical developments in Sections 3\nand 4. This is for convenience in working with the Hilbert basis of K. The following is a list of\nsome notations through this paper:\nK = ARn+ = {a1 x1 + * * * + an xn : x1 , . . . , xn \u2208 R+ }\nQsat = K \u2229 L = saturation of A \u2283 Q\nH = Qsat \\ Q = holes in Qsat\nS = {a \u2208 Q : a + Qsat \u2282 Q} = saturation points of Q\nS\u0304 = Q \\ S = non-saturation points of Q\nWe assume that there exists c \u2208 Qd such that c * ai > 0 for i = 1, . . . , n, where * is the standard\ninner product. Under this assumption K and Q are pointed and S is non-empty by Problem\n7.15 of [Miller and Sturmfels (2005)]. Qsat is partitioned as\nQsat = H \u222a S\u0304 \u222a S = H \u222a Q.\nEquivalently\nS \u2282 Q \u2282 Qsat\n\n(3)\n\nand the differences of these two inclusions are S\u0304 and H, respectively.\nIf Q is saturated (equivalently H = \u2205), then 0 \u2208 S and S = Q, because Q = 0 + Q \u2282 S + Q \u2282\nS. Therefore S = Q = Qsat in (3). Similarly if S = Q, then 0 \u2208 S and Qsat \u2282 Q, implying Q is\nsaturated. From this consideration it follows that either S = Q = Qsat or the two inclusions in\n(3) are simultaneously strict.\nWe now consider three different notions of the minimality of saturation points, i.e., points of\nS which are minimal with respect to S, Q, and Qsat . We call a \u2208 S an S-minimal (a Q-minimal,\na Qsat -minimal, resp.) if there exists no other b \u2208 S, b 6= a, such that a \u2212 b \u2208 S (Q, Qsat , resp.).\nMore formally a \u2208 S is\na) an S-minimal saturation point if (a + (\u2212(S \u222a {0}))) \u2229 S = {a},\nb) a Q-minimal saturation point if (a + (\u2212Q)) \u2229 S = {a},\nc) a Qsat -minimal saturation point if (a + (\u2212Qsat )) \u2229 S = {a}.\n\n4\n\n\fLet min(S; S) denote the set of S-minimal saturation points, min(S; Q) the set of Q-minimal\nsaturation points, and min(S; Qsat ) the set of Qsat -minimal saturation points. Because of the\ninclusion (3), it follows that\nmin(S; Qsat ) \u2282 min(S; Q) \u2282 min(S; S).\n\n(4)\n\nIf a \u2208 H, then for any b \u2208 Q, either a \u2212 b 6\u2208 Qsat or a \u2212 b \u2208 H. This is because if a \u2212 b \u2208 Qsat\nand a \u2212 b 6\u2208 H, then a \u2212 b \u2208 Q, and hence a = b + (a \u2212 b) \u2208 Q, which contradicts a \u2208 H. This\nrelation can be expressed as\nQsat \u2229 (H + (\u2212Q)) = H.\nThis relation suggests the following definition.\nDefinition 2.2. We call a \u2208 Qsat , a 6= 0, a fundamental hole if\nQsat \u2229 (a + (\u2212Q)) = {a}.\nLet H0 be the set of fundamental holes.\nExample 2.3. Consider the one-dimensional example A = (3 5 7) with L = Z. Qsat =\n{0, 1, . . .}, Q = {0, 3, 5, 6, 7, . . .}, \u2212Q = {0, \u22123, \u22125, \u22126, \u22127, . . .}, H = {1, 2, 4}, S = {5, 6, 7, . . . }\nand S\u0304 = {0, 3}. Among the 3 holes, 1 and 2 are fundamental. For example, 2 \u2208 H is fundamental because\n{0, 1, . . .} \u2229 {2, \u22121, \u22123, \u22124, \u22125, . . .} = {2}.\nOn the other hand 4 \u2208 H is not fundamental because\n{0, 1, . . .} \u2229 {4, 1, \u22121, \u22122, \u22123, . . .} = {4, 1}.\nIf 0 6= a \u2208 Q, then Qsat \u2229 (a + (\u2212Q)) \u2283 {a, 0} and a is not a fundamental hole. This implies\nthat a fundamental hole is a hole. For every non-fundamental hole x, there exists y \u2208 H such\nthat 0 6= x \u2212 y \u2208 Q. If y is not fundamental we can repeat this procedure. Since the procedure\nhas to stop in finite number of steps, it follows that every non-fundamental hole x can be written\nas\nx = y + a,\n\ny \u2208 H0 ,\n\na \u2208 Q, a 6= 0.\n\n(5)\n\nWe also focus on a Hilbert basis of a cone K and in the next section we will show a relation\nbetween the set of holes H and the minimal Hilbert basis of a pointed cone K.\nDefinition 2.4. We call a finite subset B \u2282 K \u2229 Zd a Hilbert basis of a cone K if any integral\npoint in K can be written as a nonnegative integral linear combination of elements in B. If B\nis minimal in terms of inclusion then we call it a minimal Hilbert basis of K.\nNote that there exists a Hilbert basis for any rational polyhedral cone and also if a cone is\npointed then there exists a unique minimal Hilbert basis [see Schrijver (1986) for more details].\n5\n\n\fNow we will present our main theorem of this paper and then we will present small examples\nto demonstrate the theorem. In the theorem, cone(S) denotes the set of finite nonnegative real\ncombinations of elements of S and \"rational polyhedral cone\" is a closed cone defined by rational\nlinear weak inequalities (inequalities that permit the equality case). One can find a proof of this\ntheorem in Section 4.\nTheorem 2.5. The following statements are equivalent.\n1. min(S; S) is finite.\n2. cone(S) is a rational polyhedral cone.\n3. There is some s \u2208 S on every extreme ray of K.\n4. H is finite.\n5. S\u0304 is finite.\n\nFigure 1: White circles represent non-saturation points, a triangle represents a hole, white\nsquares represent S-minimal saturation points, and black circles represent non S-minimal saturation points in the semigroup in Example 2.6.\nExample 2.6. Let A be an integral matrix such that\nA=\n\n1 1 1 1\n0 1 3 4\n\n!\n\n.\n\nThe set of holes H consists of only one element {(1, 2)t }. S\u0304 = {(0, 0)t }. min(S; S) = {(1, 0)t , (1, 1)t ,\n(1, 3)t , (1, 4)t }. Thus, H, S\u0304, and min(S; S) are all finite.\n\n6\n\n\fFigure 2: White circles represent non-saturation points, triangles represent holes, white squares\nrepresent S-minimal saturation points, and black circles represent non S-minimal saturation\npoints in the semigroup in Example 2.7.\nExample 2.7. Let A be an integral matrix such that\nA=\n\n1 1 1 1\n0 2 3 4\n\n!\n\n.\n\nThe set of holes H are the elements {(k, 1) : k \u2208 Z, k \u2265 1}. S\u0304 = {(i, 0)t : i \u2208 Z, i \u2265 0}, and\nmin(S; S) = {(k, j)t : k \u2208 Z, k \u2265 1, 2 \u2264 j \u2264 3} \u222a {(1, 4)}. Thus, H, S\u0304, and min(S; S) are all\ninfinite. However, min(S; Q) = {(1, 2)t , (1, 3)t , (1, 4)t } is finite.\n\n3\n\nNecessary and sufficient condition of finiteness of a set of holes\n\nIn this section we give a necessary and sufficient condition of finiteness of the set of holes H.\nFirstly we will show the necessary and sufficient condition in terms of the set of fundamental\nholes H0 . Then we generalize the statement, such that it is stated in terms of the minimal\nHilbert basis of K. Ezra Miller has kindly pointed out to the authors that many of our results\ncan be proved more succinctly by appropriate algebraic methods. However for the sake of selfcontained presentation we provide our own proofs and summarize his comments in Remark 3.2\nand Remark 3.6 below.\nFirst we show that the set of fundamental holes, H0 , is finite.\nProposition 3.1. H0 is finite.\nProof. Every a \u2208 Qsat can be written as\na = c1 a1 + * * * + cn an ,\n\n7\n\n(6)\n\n\fwhere ci 's are nonnegative rational numbers. (If a \u2208 H, then at least one ci is not integral.) If\nc1 > 1, then a can be written as\na = {(c1 \u2212 \u230ac1 \u230b)a1 + * * * + cn an } + \u230ac1 \u230ba1 = \u00e3 + \u230ac1 \u230ba1 ,\nand \u00e3 = a \u2212 \u230ac1 \u230ba1 . Therefore\nQsat \u2229 (a + (\u2212Q)) \u2283 {a, \u00e3}\nand a is not a fundamental hole. In this argument we can replace c1 with any ci , i \u2265 2. This\nshows each fundamental hole has an expression (6), where 0 \u2264 ci \u2264 1, i = 1, . . . , n. However\nfundamental holes belong to a compact set. Since the lattice points in a compact set are finite,\nH0 is finite.\nRemark 3.2. For any field k, consider the semigroup rings k[Q] and k[Qsat ]. Define M =\nk[Qsat ]/k[Q], which is finitely generated as a module over k[Q]. H0 is the set of degrees for the\nminimal generators of M and therefore H0 is finite.\nLet H0 = {y1 , . . . , ym }. Now for each yh \u2208 H0 and each ai define \u03bb\u0304hi as follows. If there\nexists some \u03bb \u2208 Z such that yh + \u03bbai \u2208 Q, let\n\u03bb\u0304hi = min{\u03bb \u2208 Z | yh + \u03bbai \u2208 Q}.\n\n(7)\n\nOtherwise define \u03bb\u0304hi = \u221e. Note that \u03bb\u0304hi > 0 because yh is a hole. Then we have the following\nresult:\nTheorem 3.3. H is finite if and only if \u03bb\u0304hi < \u221e for all h = 1, . . . , m and all i = 1, . . . , n.\nProof. For one direction, assume that \u03bb\u0304hi = \u221e for some h and i. Then yh + \u03bbai , \u03bb = 1, 2, . . . ,\nall belong to Qsat but do not belong to Q. Therefore they are holes. Hence H is infinite.\nFor the other direction, assume that \u03bb\u0304hi < \u221e for all h = 1, . . . , m and all i = 1, . . . , n. By\n(5), each hole can be written as\nx = yh +\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03bbi a i\n\ni=1\n\nfor some h and \u03bbi \u2208 N, i = 1, . . . , n. Now suppose that \u03bbi \u2265 \u03bb\u0304hi for some i. Then\ny h + \u03bbi a i \u2208 Q\nand\nx = y h + \u03bbi a i +\n\nX\n\n\u03bbj aj \u2208 Q,\n\nj6=i\n\nwhich contradicts that x is a hole. Therefore if x is a hole, then \u03bbi < \u03bb\u0304hi for all i. Then\nH \u2282 {yh +\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03bbhi ai | h = 1, . . . , m, 0 \u2264 \u03bbhi < \u03bb\u0304hi }.\n\ni=1\n\nThe right-hand side is finite.\n8\n\n\fRemark 3.4. There are several remarks to make. For each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, let\nX\nQ\u0303(i) = {\n\u03bbj aj | \u03bbj \u2208 N, j 6= i}\nj6=i\n\nbe the semigroup spanned by aj , j 6= i. Furthermore write\nQ\u0304(i) = Zai + Q\u0303(i) .\nFor each h and i, \u03bb\u0304hi is finite if and only if yh \u2208 Q\u0304(i) . Since yh is a hole, actually we only need\nto check\nyh \u2208 (\u2212Nai ) + Q\u0303(i) .\nBut (\u2212Nai ) + Q\u0303(i) is another semigroup, where ai in A is replaced by \u2212ai . Therefore this\nproblem is a standard membership problem in a semigroup.\nAlso we only need to check i such that ai is on an extreme ray. By a slight abuse of\nterminology, we simply say that ai is an extreme ray if ai generates an extreme ray of K.\nIf there are multiple columns of A on the same extreme ray, for definiteness we choose the\nsmallest one, although we can choose any one of them. Assume, without loss of generality, that\n{a1 , . . . , ak }, k \u2264 n, is the set of the extreme rays. The following corollary says that we only\nneed to consider i \u2264 k.\nCorollary 3.5. H is finite if and only if \u03bb\u0304hi < \u221e for all h = 1, . . . , m and all i = 1, . . . , k.\nProof. The first direction is the same as above.\nFor the converse direction, we show that if \u03bb\u0304hi < \u221e, 1 \u2264 h \u2264 m, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k, then \u03bb\u0304hi < \u221e,\n1 \u2264 h \u2264 m, k + 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. Now any non-extreme ray ai , i \u2265 k + 1, can be written as a\nnonnegative rational combination of extreme rays:\nai =\n\nk\nX\n\nqij aj ,\n\ni \u2265 k + 1.\n\n(8)\n\nj=1\n\nLet q\u0304i > 0 denote the l.c.m. of the denominators of qi1 , . . . , qik . Then multiplying both sides by\nq\u0304i , we have\nk\nX\n(q\u0304i qij )aj ,\nq\u0304i ai =\n\nq\u0304i qij \u2208 N.\n\nj=1\n\nAlso note that there is at least one qij > 0, say qij0 . Consider q\u0304i ai , 2q\u0304i ai , 3q\u0304i ai , . . . . Take \u03bb \u2208 N\nsuch that\n\u03bbq\u0304i qij0 \u2265 \u03bb\u0304hj0 .\nThen by (5)\nyh + \u03bbq\u0304i ai = yh + \u03bbq\u0304i qij0 aj0 +\n\nk\nX\n\nj6=j0\n\n9\n\n\u03bbq\u0304i qij aj \u2208 Q.\n\n\fRemark 3.6. Let k[Q], k[Qsat ] and M be defined as in Remark 3.2. The number of points in\nH is the k-vector space dimension of M . H is finite if and only if M is Artinian, which proves\nTheorem 3.3. Let k[Qrays ] denote the monoid generated by the smallest lattice points in Q on\nthe real extreme rays of Q. Then k[Q] is itself finitely generated as a module over the k[Qrays ].\nThis proves Corollary 3.5.\nAnother important point is that we want to state Theorem 3.3 in terms of Hilbert bases.\nLet B = {b1 , . . . , bL } denote the Hilbert basis of K. As above, if bl + \u03bbai \u2208 Q for some \u03bb \u2208 Z\nlet\n\u03bc\u0304li = min{\u03bb \u2208 Z | bl + \u03bbai \u2208 Q}\nand \u03bc\u0304li = \u221e otherwise. Then we have the following theorem.\nTheorem 3.7. H is finite if and only if \u03bc\u0304li < \u221e for all l = 1, . . . , L and all i = 1, . . . , n.\nProof. The first direction is the same as the above proofs.\nFor the converse direction, assume that \u03bc\u0304li < \u221e for all l = 1, . . . , L and all i = 1, . . . , n.\nLet yh be a fundamental hole. It can be written as a nonnegative integral combination of the\nelements of the Hilbert basis\nyh =\n\nL\nX\n\n\u03b1hl bl .\n\nl=1\n\nLet\n\u03bb=\n\nL\nX\n\n\u03b1hl \u03bc\u0304li .\n\nl=1\n\nThen by (5)\nyh + \u03bbai =\n=\n\nL\nX\n\nl=1\nL\nX\n\n\u03b1hl bl +\n\nL\nX\nl=1\n\n\u0001\n\u03b1hl \u03bc\u0304li ai\n\n\u03b1hl (bl + \u03bc\u0304li ai ) \u2208 Q.\n\nl=1\n\nThis implies \u03bb\u0304hi < \u221e for all h and i.\nAs in Corollary 3.5, it is clear that we only need to check extreme rays among ai 's.\nCorollary 3.8. H is finite if and only if \u03bc\u0304li < \u221e for all l = 1, . . . , L and all i = 1, . . . , k.\nRemark 3.9. In summary, determining finiteness of H is straightforward. We obtain the\nHilbert basis B of Qsat . For each b \u2208 B \\ Q and for each extreme ai , we check\nb \u2208 (\u2212Nai ) + Q\u0303(i) .\n\n10\n\n\fExample 3.10. Let A be an integral matrix such that\nA=\n\n1 1 1 1\n0 1 3 4\n\n!\n\n.\n\nThen B consists of 5 elements\nB = {b1 = (1, 0)t , b2 = (1, 1)t , b3 = (1, 2)t , b4 = (1, 3)t , b5 = (1, 4)t }.\nThen we can write b3 as the following:\n(1, 2)t = \u2212(1, 0)t + 2 * (1, 1)t\n= (1, 0)t \u2212 (1, 1)t + (1, 3)t\n= (1, 1)t \u2212 (1, 3)t + (1, 4)t\n= 2 * (1, 3)t \u2212 (1, 4)t .\nThus, in this case, we have \u03bc\u03043i = 1 for each i = 1, . . . , 4 and \u03bc\u0304li = 0, where l 6= 3 and each\ni = 1, . . . , 4. Thus by Theorem 3.7, the number of elements in H is finite. Note that H consists\nof only one element {b3 = (1, 2)t }.\n\n4\n\nSimultaneous finiteness of holes, non-saturation points, and\nminimal saturation points\n\nIn this section we will show the simultaneous finiteness of holes, non-saturation points, and\nS-minimal saturation points. As in the previous section let {a1 , . . . , ak }, k \u2264 n, be the set of\nthe extreme rays. First, we will show the following lemmas.\nLemma 4.1. Suppose that Q is not saturated. a \u2208 Q is a saturation point if and only if\na + y \u2208 Q for all fundamental holes y.\nProof. If a \u2208 Q is a saturation point, then a + y \u2208 Q for all y \u2208 Qsat . In particular a + y \u2208 Q\nfor all fundamental holes y.\nNow suppose that a \u2208 Q is not a saturation point. Then there exists y \u2208 Qsat such that\na + y is a hole. This y has to be a hole, because otherwise a + y \u2208 Q. y can be written as\ny = yh + b for some fundamental hole yh and b \u2208 Q. Then a + y = a + yh + b and a + yh has\nto be hole. Therefore we have shown that if a is not a saturation point, then a + y is a hole for\nsome fundamental hole y.\nLemma 4.2. Suppose that Q is not saturated. Consider any column ai of A. There exists some\nni \u2208 N such that ni ai \u2208 S if and only if \u03bb\u0304hi < \u221e in (7) for all h = 1, . . . , m.\nProof. This follows from Lemma 4.1. If ni ai \u2208 S, \u03bb\u0304hi \u2264 ni . For the other direction take\nni = maxh \u03bb\u0304hi .\n11\n\n\fNow we consider the following two conditions.\nCondition 1 For each ai , there exists ni > 0 such that ni ai \u2208 S.\nCondition 2 For each extreme ray ai , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k, there exists ni > 0 such that ni ai \u2208 S.\nProposition 4.3. Condition 1, Condition 2, and the finiteness of H are equivalent.\nProof. Condition 1 trivially implies Condition 2. On the other hand suppose that Condition 2\nholds. Then each non-extreme ai , k < i \u2264 n, can be written as (8). As above let q\u0304i > 0 denote\nthe l.c.m. of the denominators of qi1 , . . . , qik and let ni = q\u0304i \u00d7 n1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 nk , then ni ai \u2208 S and\nCondition 1 holds.\nNow we show the equivalence between the finiteness of H and the other two conditions.\nUsing Lemma 4.2, Condition 1 is equivalent to the condition in Theorem 3.3. Also Condition 2\nis equivalent to the condition in Corollary 3.5.\nNow we prove Theorem 2.5.\nProof for Theorem 2.5. 1. \u21d0\u21d2 2. : min(S; S) is an integral generating set of the monoid\nS \u222a {0}. We then apply Theorem 1.1 (b) of [Hemmecke and Weismantel (2006)] or Theorem 4\nin [Jeroslow (1978)].\n2. \u21d0\u21d2 3. : If cone(S) is not polyhedral, there must be an extreme ray e of K not in cone(S),\nsince K is polyhedral. Thus, e \u2229 S = \u2205.\nIf cone(S) is polyhedral, then it is a rational polyhedron and has a finite integral generating\nset. Thus, by Theorem 8.8 in [Bertsimas and Weismantel (2005)] the polyhedron cone(S) contains all lattice points from its recession cone K and (K \\ cone(S)) \u2229 Zd is finite, which in this\ncase can only happen if cone(S) = K. Thus, there is a point from S on each extreme ray of K.\n3. \u21d0\u21d2 4. : The statement 3. is equivalent to Condition 2. Thus, the proof follows directly by\nProposition 4.3.\n4. \u21d0\u21d2 5. : Suppose that H is finite. Then by Condition 1, it is easy to see that S\u0304 is contained\nin a compact set and hence S\u0304 is finite. For the opposite implication, suppose that H is infinite.\nSince Condition 1 does not hold, there exists some i such that nai 6\u2208 S for all n \u2208 N. Then\n{ai , 2ai , 3ai , . . . } \u2282 S\u0304 and S\u0304 is infinite.\nNow we consider the generators min(S; Q) and we prove that min(S; Q) is always finite.\nThen by (4) min(S; Qsat ) is always finite as well. Note that the multi-dimensional Frobenius\nproblem can be stated as computing the sets min(S; Q) and min(S; Qsat ).\nProposition 4.4. min(S; Q) is finite.\nProof. Note that Q is a finitely generated monoid. Consider the algebra, k[Q] := k[ta1 , * * * , tan ],\nwhere k is any algebraic field. Then k[Q] is a finitely generated k-algebra by Proposition 2.5 in\n[Bruns and Gubeladze (2006)] and therefore a Noetherian ring by a corollary of Hilbert's basis\n12\n\n\ftheorem (Corollary 1.3 in [Eisenbud (1995)]). Since IS :=< t\u03b2 : \u03b2 \u2208 S > is an ideal in k[Q], we\nare done.\nA combinatorial proof of this proposition is given in [Hemmecke et al. (2007)].\nProposition 4.5.\nmin(S; Q) \u2282 min(S; Qsat ) + (H0 \u222a {0}).\n\n(9)\n\nProof. Let a \u2208 min(S; Q). We want to show that a can be written as a = \u00e3 + b, where\n\u00e3 \u2208 min(S; Qsat ) and b \u2208 H0 \u222a {0}. If a itself belongs to min(S; Qsat ), then take a = \u00e3 and\nb = 0. Otherwise, if a 6\u2208 min(S; Qsat ), then by definition of Qsat -minimality there exists a\u2032 \u2208 S\nsuch that 0 6= a \u2212 a\u2032 \u2208 Qsat . If a\u2032 6\u2208 min(S; Qsat ), then we can do the same operation to a\u2032 . This\noperation has to stop in finite steps and we arrive at \u00e3 \u2208 min(S; Qsat ) such that b = a\u2212 \u00e3 \u2208 Qsat .\nIf this b 6\u2208 H0 , then there exists c \u2208 Q, c 6= 0, such that b \u2212 c \u2208 Qsat . Then\na = \u00e3 + b = \u00e3 + (b \u2212 c) + c,\nwhere \u00e3 \u2208 S, b \u2212 c \u2208 Qsat . Since S + Qsat \u2282 S, \u00e3 + (b \u2212 c) \u2208 S. But this contradicts\na \u2208 min(S; Q).\n\n5\n\nApplications to contingency tables\n\nAn s-way contingency table of size n1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 ns is an array of nonnegative integers v =\n\u0001\n(vi1 ,...,is ), 1 \u2264 ij \u2264 nj . For 0 \u2264 r < s, an r-marginal of v is any of the sr possible r-way\ntables obtained by summing the entries over all but r indices. In this section we apply our\ntheorem to some examples including 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 tables with 2-marginals and 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2\ntables with three 2-marginals and a 3-marginal ([12][13][14][234]). Also we apply our theorem to\nthree-way contingency tables from [Vlach (1986)]. To compute minimal Hilbert bases of cones,\nwe used normaliz [Bruns and Koch (2001)] and to compute each hyperplane representation and\nvertex representation we used CDD [Fukuda (2005)] and lrs [Avis (2005)].

All of\nthese vectors are extreme rays of the cone, which we verified via cddlib [Fukuda (2005)]. The\nHilbert basis of the cone generated by these 16 vectors contains 17 vectors b1 , . . . , b17 . The first\n16 vectors are the same as ai , i.e. bi = ai , i = 1, . . . , 16. The 17-th vector b17 is\nb17 = (1 1 . . . 1)t\nconsisting of all 1's. Thus, b17 6\u2208 Q.

We solved these systems via lrs and LattE [DeLoera et al. (2003)].

Thus the semigroup is generated by 16 vectors in Z12\nsuch that:\n1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1\n1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0\n1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nAll of these vectors are extreme rays of the cone (verified via cddlib). The Hilbert basis of\n\n15\n\n\fthe cone generated by these 16 vectors consists of these 16 vectors and two additional vectors\nb17 = (1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0)t ,\n\nb18 = (1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1)t .\n\nThus, b17 , b18 6\u2208 Q. Then we set the system of linear equations such that:\nb1 x1 + b2 x2 + * * * + b16 x16 = b17\nx1 \u2208 Z\u2212 , xi \u2208 Z+ , for i = 2, * * * , 16.\nWe solved the system via lrs and CDD. We noticed that this system has no real solution (infeasible). This means that\nb17 6\u2208 (\u2212Na1 ) + Q\u0303(1) .\nThus by Theorem 3.7, the number of elements in H is infinite.\n\nResults on three-way tables\nResults on the saturation of 3-DIPTP are summarized in Theorem 6.4 of [Ohsugi and Hibi\n(2006)]. They show that a normality (i.e., Q is saturated) or non-normality (i.e., Q is not\nsaturated) of Q is not known only for the following three cases:\n5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 3,\n\n5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3,\n\n4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3.\n\nAll 2 \u00d7 J \u00d7 K tables are unimodular and hence saturated. This means that there is no hole in\nQ, and thus a 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 example in [Irving and Jerrum (1994)] is not a hole. All 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 J tables\nare saturated by the result of Sullivant (2004).\n1\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n1\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n1\n1\n\n0\n1\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n0\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nFigure 3: An example of 3 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 6 table such that the given marginal condition is a hole of the\nsemigroup.\nFor 3 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 6 tables with 2-marginals, Vlach (1986) showed an example which has a table with nonnegative real entries, but does not have a table with nonnegative integer entries.\nThis example can be found in Figure 3. Actually it is a particular example of Lemma 6.1 of\n16\n\n\f[Ohsugi and Hibi (2006)]. Aoki and Takemura (2003) presents a non-squarefree indispensable\nmove z = z + \u2212 z \u2212 of size 3 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 6, where 2 appears both in the positive part z + and the\nnegative part z \u2212 . For this z there exist two standard coordinate vectors e1 , e2 such that\nu = z + \u2212 2e1 \u2265 0,\n\nv = z \u2212 \u2212 2e2 \u2265 0.\n\nIn this case Lemma 6.1 of [Ohsugi and Hibi (2006)] proves that b = A(u + v)/2 \u2208 Qsat is a hole\nand this corresponds to Vlach's example.\nUsing Vlach's example, one can also show that 3\u00d74\u00d77 tables and bigger tables have infinitely\nmany holes. We take the example in Figure 3. Then we embed the table in a 3 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 7 table.\nThen we put a single arbitrary positive integer c at just one place of the seventh 3 \u00d7 4 slice.\nThis positive integer is uniquely determined by 2-marginals of the seventh slice alone (Table 1).\nThus for each choice of c the beginning 3 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 6 part remains to be a hole. Since c is arbitrary,\n3 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 7 table has infinite number of holes.\nsum\n\nsum\n\nc\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nc\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nc\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nc\n\nTable 1: the 7-th 3 \u00d7 4 slice is uniquely determined by its row and its column sums. c is an\narbitrary positive integer.\n\nWe can generalize this idea as follows. Let A1 denote the integer matrix corresponding to\nproblem of a smaller size. Suppose that A for a larger problem can be written as a partitioned\nmatrix\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nA1 0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed 0 A2 \uf8f8 ,\nA3 A4\n\nwhere A3 and A4 are arbitrary. We consider the case that for A1 there exists a hole. Now\nconsider the semigroup associated with A2 . We assume that there exists infinite number of\none-element fibers for the semigroup associated with A2 . This is usually the case, because the\nfibers on the extreme ray for A2 is all one-element fibers, under the condition that A2 does not\ncontain more than one extreme rays in the same direction.\nUnder these assumptions consider the equation\n\uf8eb \uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n!\nt1\nA1 0\nx\n1\n\uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n,\n\uf8edt2 \uf8f8 = \uf8ed 0 A2 \uf8f8\nx2\nt3\nA3 A4\n17\n\n\fwhere t1 is a hole for A1 , t2 is any of the one-element fibers for A2 and t3 is chosen to satisfy the\nequation. Then (t1 , t2 , t3 )t is a hole for each t2 . Therefore there exist infinite number of holes\nfor the larger problem.\nExample 5.1. Let A1 be an integral matrix such that\nA1 =\n\n1 1 1 1\n0 1 3 4\n\n!\n\n.\n\nand let A2 = (1). From Example 2.6, H consists of only one element {t1 = (1, 2)t } and with A2\nwe can find a family of infinite number of one-element fibers, namely Fc := {c}, where c is an\narbitrary positive integer. Let t2 = c. Then we have\n\uf8eb\n!\n1\nA1 0\n\uf8ec\n=\uf8ed 0\nA=\n0 A2\n0\n\na matrix A such that:\n\uf8f6\n1 1 1 0\n\uf8f7\n1 3 4 0 \uf8f8.\n0 0 0 1\n\nNote that (t1 , t2 )t = (1, 2, c)t is a hole for each t2 = c. Thus, since c is an arbitrary positive\ninteger, there exist infinitely many holes for the semigroup generated by the columns of the matrix\nA.\n\n6\n\nTime complexity\n\nIn 2002, Barvinok and Woods (2003) introduced an algorithm to encode all integral vectors\nb \u2208 Zd in Problem 1.1 as a short rational generating function in polynomial time when d and\nn are fixed (Lemma 6.3 stated below). However, in a sub-step of the algorithm they use the\nProjection Theorem which is not implementable at present. Thus, we do not know whether it\nis practical or not. From Lemma 6.3, we can show that the time complexity of computing H is\npolynomial time if we fix d and n (Corollary 6.5).\nOne might ask the time complexity of Problem 1.2. Using the results from [Barvinok (1994);\nBarvinok and Pommersheim (1999); Barvinok and Woods (2003)], we can prove that Problem\n1.2 can be solved in polynomial time in fixed d and n (Theorem 6.1). In order to prove the\ntheorem, we will use the multivariate generating function of a set X \u2282 Zd , f (X; x). Namely, if\nX \u2282 Zd , define the generating function\nf (X; x) =\n\nX\n\nxs ,\n\ns\u2208X\n\nwhere xs denotes xs11 * * * xdsd with s = (s1 , . . . , sd ). If X = P \u2229 Zd with fixed d, where P is\na rational convex polyhedron, or if X = Q with fixed d and n, then Barvinok (1994) and\nBarvinok and Woods (2003), respectively, showed that f (X; x) can be written in the form of a\npolynomial-size sum of rational function of the form:\nX\nx\u03b1i\n.\nf (X; x) =\n\u03b3i Qd\n\u03b2ij )\n(1\n\u2212\nx\nj=1\ni\u2208I\n18\n\n(10)\n\n\fHerein, I is a finite (polynomial size) index set and all the appearing data \u03b3i \u2208 Q and \u03b1i , \u03b2ij \u2208 Zd\nis of size polynomial. If a rational generating function f (X; x) is polynomial size in the total\nbit size of inputs, then f (X; x) is called a short rational generating function. As an example, if\nP is the one-dimensional polytope [0, N ], N \u2208 Z+ , then f (P \u2229 Z; x) = 1 + x + x2 + * * * + xN ,\nf (P \u2229 Z; x) can be represented by a short rational generating function (1 \u2212 xN +1 )/(1 \u2212 x).\nTheorem 6.1. Suppose we fix d and n. There is a polynomial time algorithm in terms of the\ninput size to decide whether the set of holes, H, for the semigroup, Q, generated by the columns\nof A is finite or not.\nUsing the generating functions, we can show that the computation of fundamental holes for\nQ can be solved polynomial time if we fix d and n.\nTheorem 6.2. Suppose we fix d and n. Suppose Q is not saturated. The set of fundamental\nholes, H0 , can be encoded in a short rational generating function in time polynomial in terms of\nthe input size.\nOne notes that this algorithm outputs a generating function in the form of a short rational\ngenerating function. Therefore this does not return an explicit representation of H0 . However,\nif one wants to enumerate all elements in H0 , one can do the following: from the proof of\nProposition 3.1, we have H0 \u2282 P \u2229 Zd , where\nP := {x \u2208 Rd : x =\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03b4i ai , 0 \u2264 \u03b4i \u2264 1}.\n\n(11)\n\ni=1\n\nThis shows that H0 is finite and also gives a finite procedure to enumerate H0 :\n\u2022 Compute the Hilbert basis B of cone(a1 , . . . , an ) \u2229 L.\n\u2022 Check each z \u2208 B whether it is a fundamental hole or not, that is, compute B \u2229 H0 .\n\u2022 Generate all nonnegative integer combinations of elements in B \u2229 H0 that lie in P \u2229 Zd\nand check for each such z whether it is a fundamental hole or not.\nFor more details, see [Hemmecke et al. (2007)].\nBefore proofs of Theorem 6.1 and Theorem 6.2, we would like to state lemmas from [Barvinok and Woods\n(2003)] and [Barvinok and Pommersheim (1999)].\nLemma 6.3 ((7.3) in [Barvinok and Woods (2003)]). Suppose we fix d and n. Let Q = Q(A).\nThen the generating function f (Q; x) for the semigroup Q can be computed in polynomial time\nin terms of the input size as a short rational generating function in the form of (10).\nLemma 6.4 (Theorem 4.4 in [Barvinok and Pommersheim (1999)]). Suppose we fix d and suppose P \u2282 Rd is a rational convex polyhedron. Then the generating function f (P \u2229 Zd ; x) can be\ncomputed in polynomial time in terms of the input size as a short rational generating function\nin the form of (10).\n19\n\n\fBy Lemma 6.3 and Lemma 6.4, immediately, we have the following result.\nCorollary 6.5. Suppose we fix d and n. Let Q = Q(A). Then the generating function f (H; x)\nfor the set of holes, H := Qsat \\Q, can be computed in polynomial time in terms of the input size\nas a short rational generating function in the form of (10).\nProof. Suppose we fix d and n. By Lemma 6.3, we can compute the generating function f (Q; x)\nfor the semigroup Q in polynomial time and by Lemma 6.4 we can compute the generating\nfunction f (Qsat ; x) for the semigroup Qsat in polynomial time. The generating function f (H; x)\nfor H is f (Qsat ; x) \u2212 f (Q; x).\nUsing Corollary 6.5, we can prove Theorem 6.1.\nProof of Theorem 6.1. Suppose we fix d and n. First, we use Corollary 6.5 to compute the\ngenerating function, f (H; x), for H in polynomial time in the form of (10). Let\nf (H; x) =\n\nX\ni\u2208I\n\n\u03b3i Qd\n\nx\u03b1i\n\nj=1 (1\n\n\u2212 x\u03b2ij )\n\n.\n\nThen, we will do the following: First we choose l \u2208 Zd so that hl, \u03b2ij i =\n6 0. We find such l in\npolynomial time by Lemma 2.5 in [Barvinok and Woods (2003)]. Let l = (\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbd ) \u2208 Zd . For\n\u03c4 > 0, let x\u03c4 = (exp(\u03c4 \u03bb1 ), . . . , exp(\u03c4 \u03bbd )) and let \u03beij = hl, \u03b2ij i and \u03bdi = hl, \u03b1i i. Then we apply\nthe monomial substitution xi \u2192 exp(\u03c4 \u03bbi ). We can do this monomial substitution in polynomial\ntime by Lemma 2.5 and Theorem 2.6 in [Barvinok and Woods (2003)]. Then\n!\n\u03c4 d exp(\u03c4 \u03bdi )\n1 X\n.\n\u03b3i Qd\nf (H; x\u03c4 ) = d\n\u03c4\nj=1 (1 \u2212 exp(\u03c4 \u03beij ))\ni\u2208I\n\nLet\n\nhi (\u03c4 ) = Qd\n\n\u03c4 d exp(\u03c4 \u03bdi )\n\nj=1 (1\n\n\u2212 exp(\u03c4 \u03beij ))\n\nis a holomorphic function in a neighborhood of \u03c4 = 0 and we take the Taylor expansion around\n\u03c4 = 0 (i.e., we take the Laurent expansion around \u03c4 = 0 for hi (\u03c4 )/\u03c4 d ). The coefficients of the\nkth powers, where 0 \u2264 k \u2264 d \u2212 1, of the Taylor expansion of hi are:\n!\nk\nX\n1\n\u03bdil\ntdk\u2212l (\u03bei1 , . . . , \u03beid ) ,\n\u03bei1 * * * \u03beid\nl!\nl=0\n\nwhere tdl (\u03bei1 , . . . , \u03beid ) is a homogeneous polynomial of degree l and which is called the lth Todd\npolynomial in \u03bei1 , . . . , \u03beid (see more details in Definition 5.1 in [Barvinok and Pommersheim\n(1999)]).\nP\nNow we claim that if the coefficients of negative powers of the Laurent expansion of ( i\u2208I hi (\u03c4 ))/\u03c4 d\n\nare all canceled, then H has to be finite. We prove this by contradiction. Suppose H is infinite.\n\n20\n\n\fThen, since all coefficients of negative powers in the Laurent expansion are canceled, the sum\nof the coefficients of the constant terms:\nX\ni\u2208I\n\n\u03b3i\n\u03bei1 * * * \u03beid\n\nd\nX\n\u03bdl\ni\n\nl=0\n\nl!\n\n!\n\ntdd\u2212l (\u03bei1 , . . . , \u03beid )\n\n(12)\n\nmust be equal to the number of elements in H when we send \u03c4 \u2192 0 ((5.2) [Barvinok and Pommersheim\n(1999)]). Thus, the sum of the coefficients of the constant terms in (12) must be equal to infinity.\nSince I is a finite index set, a coefficient of the constant term in the Laurent expansion of some\nrational function must be infinite. However, the Todd polynomials are polynomials in C so it is\nimpossible. Thus we reach a contradiction.\nConversely, it is obvious that if the coefficients of negative powers of the Laurent expansion\nP\nof ( i\u2208I hi (\u03c4 ))/\u03c4 d are not canceled, then H is infinite.\nTherefore we will have to check all coefficients of the kth powers, where 0 \u2264 k \u2264 d \u2212 1, of the\n\nTaylor expansion of each hi (\u03c4 ). Since we have the polynomial size index set I and we have to\nonly check d coefficients for each rational function, this computation can be done in polynomial\ntime.\nNow we would like to discuss the intersection algorithm, which we need to encode H0 in a\nshort rational generating function in polynomial time in fixed d and n.\nLemma 6.6 (Theorem 3.6 in Barvinok and Woods (2003)). Let S1 , S2 be finite subsets of Zd , for\nfixed d. Let f (S1 ; x) and f (S2 ; x) be their generating functions, given as short rational generating\nfunctions with at most k binomials in each denominator. Then there exist a polynomial time\nalgorithm, which, given f (Si ; x), computes\nf (S1 \u2229 S2 ; x)\n\n=\n\nX\n\n\u03b3i *\n\ni\u2208I\n\nxu i\n(1 \u2212 xvi1 ) * * * (1 \u2212 xvis )\n\nwith s \u2264 2k, where the \u03b3i are rational numbers, ui , vij nonzero integers, and I is a polynomialsize index set.\nThe essential step in the intersection algorithm is the Hadamard product [Definition 3.2 in\nBarvinok and Woods (2003)]. Using Lemma 6.6, we can compute the union of s sets in Zd in\npolynomial time for fixed d and s.\nWe now give a proof of Theorem 6.2.\nProof of Theorem 6.2. Suppose Q is not saturated. Using Lemma 6.4, we compute the generating function f (P \u2229 Zd ; x) in polynomial time, where P is given in (11). Note that there\nP\nare 2n points in P \u2229 Q, namely {x \u2208 Q : x = ni=1 \u03bei ai , \u03bei \u2208 {0, 1}}. So we can enumerate\n\nall points in P \u2229 Q in constant time. Let H\u0304 = (P \u2229 Zd ) \\ (P \u2229 Q). Its generating function\n\nf (H\u0304; x) is f (P \u2229 Zd ; x) \u2212 f (P \u2229 Q; x) and it can be computed in polynomial time. Note that\nH0 = H\u0304 \\ ((H\u0304 + (P \u2229 Q)) \u2229 H\u0304) from the definition of H0 and H0 \u2282 (P \u2229 Zd ) \\ (P \u2229 Q).\n21\n\n\fWe compute the generating function for (H\u0304 + (P \u2229 Q)) by the following: let (P \u2229 Q) \\ {0} =\n{z1 , * * * , z2n \u22121 }. For each i = 1, 2, . . . , 2n \u2212 1, let gi (x) := xzi * f (H\u0304; x) which is the generating\nfunction for the set zi + H\u0304. Since 2n \u2212 1 is a constant (we are fixing n as a constant), applying\nLemma 6.6 we can compute the generating function for the union of zi + H\u0304 in polynomial time.\nSince H\u0304 and (P \u2229 Q) are finite we are done.\n\nAcknowledgment\nWe would like to thank Dr. Seth Sullivant for useful references, Dr. Raymond Hemmecke\nand Prof. Robert Weismantel for useful comments and references for Theorem 2.5, Prof. Ezra\nMiller for algebraic interpretations and proofs of our results, Prof. Alexander Barvinok and Dr.\nSven Verdoolaege for useful suggestions for the proof of Theorem 6.1, Prof. Hidefumi Ohsugi\nfor pointing out the relation between holes and non-squarefree indispensable moves.
