Introduction\nIn 1820, Christian Oersted noticed that a compass needle deflected in the presence of a currentcarrying wire. However, the classical set-up employs a source of steady power supply and a current of\n10-20 A, which makes the demonstration very difficult.\nHence, our aim is to modify the Oersted experiment to make it easy and low-cost and to use\nsimple voltage sources. The implementation of a planar coil of wires, which deflects vigorously the\ncompass magnetic needle (more than 80 angular degrees) when a current of up to 1 A flows along it,\nhas been reported. (See [1]). The planar coil creates a magnetic field in the middle of the bundle of\nwires , which is very close to the magnetic field of a single infinite straight current-carrying wire. In\n[1] theoretically presents the interaction between the magnetic needle of a compass and the magnetic\nfield created by the coil. As a result, the possibility for the coil and the compass to be used as a tangent\ngalvanometer has been theoretically and experimentally proved. Strong nonlinearities in the functional\ndependences have been ascertained taking into account the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field\naround the current-carrying wire.\nThus, the need to find another way to create a galvanometer using this horizontal coil emerges.\nThe aim of the following paper is to point out the possibility to use the coil and the compass as a sinus\ngalvanometer.\n2. Theoretical description of the interaction between a compass and a current-carrying wire\n2.1 A magnetic needle in the magnetic field of a wire\nThe theoretical analysis of the interaction between the magnetic field of a wire and the magnetic\nneedle will be carried out using the approach in [1]. First, the interaction between a magnetic needle\nand the magnetic field of a straight infinite horizontal current-carrying wire will be examined.\nLet a current-carrying wire lie on the OY -axis of the Cartesian coordinate system K (figure 1). A\nsteady current flows along the wire with a magnitude of I, having the same positive direction as OY-\n\n\faxis. At a point on the OZ-axis the suspension point lies at a distance of z from the origin of the\ncoordinate system of a magnetic needle of a length D . The pivot of the magnetic needle coincides\nwith the OZ-axis while the magnetic needle lies and moves on \u0430 plane parallel to XOY plane. The\nactual position of the magnetic needle is characterized by the rotation angle of the needle q with\nrespect to the positive direction of OY-axis (figure 1). The magnetic needle has a magnetic dipole\nmoment of m .\nThe flowing current creates a magnetic field around the wire. The magnitude of the horizontal\ncomponent B I of the magnetic induction vector in the positive direction of OX-axis is [1]:\n\nm 0 .I z\n.\n2.p r 2\n\n(1)\n\nr = z 2 + x2 .\n\n(2)\n\nBI =\nwhere\n\nis the distance from the given point with coordinates of (x, y, z) to the wire axis.\n\nFigure 1. Mutual disposition of a magnetic needle and a horizontal wire.\nDue to the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field around the wire the torque of the magnetic needle\nM I is obtained by the integration of the infinite small torques created by the different infinite small\nparts of the magnetic needle.\nThe torque of the whole needle, M I , is [1]:\nD\nm 0 .I\nm .I\nz 2 dm\nMI = .m. cos q.\u00f2 2 .\n= - 0 .m. cos q.f (d )\nm\n2.p.z\n2.p.z\n0 r\n\n( 3)\n\nThe integral on the right side of (3) is a dimensionless function f (d ) of the parameter d (which is\nalso dimensionless):\n\nd=\n\nD . sin q\n.\n2.z\n\n( 4)\n\n\fGenerally, the function of f (d ) is even and decreases with an increase of d due to the needle\nsymmetry which takes the pivot into account. At zero, the function of f (d ) has a value of 1.\n2.2 A magnetic needle in the magnetic field of the Earth\nr\nThe horizontal component of the induction of Earth's magnetic field is represented by B e . If vector\n\nr\nB e is at angle b with the OY \u2013 axis of the coordinate system, it has the following components in the\n\nsame coordinate system\n\nr\nB e = ( - B e . sin b , B e . cos b , 0).\n\n( 5)\n\nThe geomagnetic field is a homogeneous one. The interaction of the magnetic needle with it\nresults in a torque of M e :\n\nM e = -m.B e . sin( q - b ).\n\n( 6)\n\n2.3 A magnetic needle in the Earth's and the wire's magnetic fields\nWe assume the magnetic needle has a moment of inertia, J , towards its pivot. Taking into\nconsideration (3) and (6), the simultaneous action of both the Earth's magnetic field and the one\ncreated by the wire can be expressed by following equation of twisting motion [1]:\n\nm .I\nd 2q\nJ . 2 = -m.B e . sin( q - b ) - m. 0 .cosq.f( d ).\n2.p.z\ndt\n\n(7)\n\nThe above equation has the following stationary solutions.\n(i) At zero current along the wire and applying (7), we obtain: q = b , and the needle orients\nitself along the Earth's magnetic field.\n(ii) At q = 0 all parts of the magnetic needle are at the same distance from the wire, and d = 0 .\nApplying (7), we obtain:\n\nB e . sin b = B I =\n\nm 0 .I\n.\n2.p .z\n\n( 8)\n\nAfter transformation we obtain:\n\nI=\n\n2.p .z .B e\n.sinb = I e .sinb .\nm0\n\n( 9)\n\nwhere I e is the equivalent to the current of Earth's magnetic field when z is given:\n\nIe =\n\n2.p.z .B e\n.\nm0\n\n(10)\n\nEquation (9) can be used as a method for measuring the current magnitude, which could be\ncalled a sinus galvanometer.\n3. Current coil in the mode of sinus galvanometer\n\n\fSo far, the theoretical analysis to use the compass magnetic needle as a sinus galvanometer has been\npresented. To implement it in reality would require greater accuracy than as a tangent galvanometer.\nMoreover, the measured current values must be limited to the value of I e (taking into account (9)\n\nI \u00a3 Ie )\n3.1 A measuring procedure for a sinus galvanometer\nThe procedure to measure the current along the wire is as follows:\n1. The noncurrent-carrying wire orients itself along the north-south direction by the compass\n(figure 2a). The compass scale is set to zero. The wire and the compass are steadily fixed, respectively.\n2. A current flows along the wire with a magnitude which is of interest to us (figure 2b). The\nmagnetic needle deflects at a certain angle.\n3. The current-carrying wire and the compass are rotated simultaneously as far as the compass\nneedle sets to zero (figure 2c).\n4. The current along the wire is switched off and the deflected angle of b is determined by the\ncompass scale (figure 2d). The current magnitude is estimated applying (9).\n\nFigure 2\u0430. Initial position\n\nFigure 2b. Current is on\n\nFigure 2c. Rotation of the wire\n\nFigure 2d. Current is off\n\n\f3.2 Description of the set-up and consideration of results\nThe above-mentioned set-up was carried out using a planar horizontal coil of wires described in [1]\nand shown in figure 3. The total number of windings in the bunch was 24 (N=24). When a current of I\nflows along each current-carrying wire, the total current along the bunch windings is I.N. A steady\ncurrent source was provided by a dc power supply rectifier with an output voltage of up to 15 V and a\nmax current of 2 \u0410. A resistance of 15 W with a dispersing power of 20 W was connected in serial as\na ballast into the planar coil.\nIn the set-up, the planar coil was placed horizontally and the compass lay in the middle of the\nbunch windings (See figure 3).\n\nFigure 3. Framework of the planar coil of wires used in the set-up\nFirst, the bunch windings were oriented along the north-south direction by the compass as the\ncurrent was switched off along the frame. The compass scale was set to zero. Thus, the magnetic field\ncreated by the bunch windings, B I , had a direction, which was perpendicular to the direction of the\nhorizontal component of the Earth's magnetic field, B e .\nThen, the current was switched on along the frame and the magnetic needle deflected at an angle\nof q . The angle of deflection on the left has a positive sign (See figure 2b).\nNext, the frame and the compass and the compass on it were rotated so as to reset the compass\nneedle to zero (figure 2c).\nFinally, the current was switched off and the deflection angle, b , was determined by the compass\nscale.\nTaking the experiment into account and applying (9), we obtain\n\nI.N =\n\n2.p .B e\n.z.sinb\nm0\n\n(11)\n\n\fThe range of the deflection angle, b , was from - 75 o to + 75 o at an interval of 15 o . Figure 4\nrepresents the measurements obtained from the multiplication of the current, I, by the number of\nwindings, N, as a function of the deflection angle, b , of the compass needle acting as a sinus\ngalvanometer. The graph also displays the linear dependence of the current on sin b with a high\ncoefficient of correlation.\n\nI.N, A\n2.00\ny = 1.6462x + 0.0031\n\n1.50\n\n2\n\nR = 0.9999\n\n1.00\n0.50\n0.00\n-0.50\n-1.00\n-1.50\nsin b\n\n-2.00\n-1.00\n\n-0.50\n\n0.00\n\n0.50\n\n1.00\n\nFigure 4. Measurements taking into account (9) applying sin b .\nAs a result, the deflected angle of the compass needle measured as precisely as possible makes us\nbelieve that the horizontal coil of wires could be used as a sinus galvanometer either for\ndemonstrations or could be given as an assignment in Physics laboratory workshops. For instance, the\nobtained average value of I e = 1.6462 A in the measurements (figure 4) and at z = 11.9 mm the\nmagnitude of the horizontal component of Earth's magnetic field has been estimated at\nBe = ( 27.69 \u00b1 0.05 )  \u0301 10 -6 T at Sofia Technical University, Sliven Engineering Pedagogical\nFaculty.\n4. Analysis of the planar coil magnetic field\nThe linearity of the dependence (11) and the simple calculations urged us to use the planar coil as a\nsinus galvanometer in estimating the magnetic field created in the area of the bunch windings of the\ncoil. We take the Earth's magnetic field as a standard and for the magnetic field created by the current\napplying (11), we obtain\n\nm .I .N\nBI\n= sin b = 0\n.\nBe\nB e .2.p.z\n\n(12)\n\n\fHence, the magnetic field of the coil grows in linearity with the current increase of I .N at one\nand the same distance of the compass from the wire z . Moreover, the inclination of the straight line is\ndisproportional to z .\nThe distance from the wire to the compass z could vary by placing several pads under the\ncompass. To make the analysis of the dependence, B I , easy a transformation with the same linear\nconnection along z (at constant b ) could be applied:\n\nI.N 2.p.B e\n=\n.z .\nsinb\nm0\n\n(13)\n\n4.1 Description of the set-up and consideration of results\nIn the set-up, the frame was placed horizontally on a plane and the compass lay in the middle of the\nbunch windings (See figure 5). A number of dielectric plates, n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 , with one and the same\nwidth of d = 8.6 mm were put between the coil plane and the compass.\n\nFigure 5. Location of the compass and 2 pads\nThe dielectric plates set the compass needle from the wire at a distance of\n\nz = z 0 + n.d.\n\n(14)\n\nHere z 0 = 11.9 mm is the minimum distance between the wire and the compass magnetic\nneedle, which is obtained when the compass directly lies on the plastic sheet of the planar coil.\nThe experiment was carried out as follows:\n\n\fFirst, the bundle windings were oriented along the north-south direction by the compass on an\noff-current coil of wires and the compass scale was set at zero.\nThen, the current, I, was switched on along the frame and the magnetic needle deflected at an\nangle of q . The angle of deflection on the left has a positive sign (See figure 2b).\nNext, the frame and the compass on it were rotated so as to reset the compass needle to zero\n(figure 2c).\nFinally, the current was switched off and the deflection angle, b , was determined by the\ncompass scale (figure 2d).\nHowever, the dependences of (12) and (13) could be determined easily if the angle, b , was\ngiven to determine the current which sets the compass needle to zero, the values range of the\ndeflection angle, b , were from 0 o to + 75 o at an interval of 15 o .\nB I/B e\n1.00\n\n0.80\n\n0.60\n0d\n1d\n\n0.40\n\n2d\n3d\n4d\n\n0.20\n\n0.00\n0.00\n\nI.N, A\n1.00\n\n2.00\n\n3.00\n\n4.00\n\n5.00\n\n6.00\n\nFigure 6. Variations of the coil magnetic field as a function of the current\nFigure 6 shows the measurements of B I / B e as a function of the multiplication of the current, I,\nby the number of windings, N, using different number of pads under the compass. The graph also\ndisplays a linear dependence on the current along the coil taking into consideration the measuring\naccuracy of the angle, b . Moreover, it could also serve as an experiment check-up of (12) confirming\nthe linear dependence on the current.\nFinally, the graph shows that the inclination of the straight line decreases with the increase of n ,\nwhich leads to the rise of z (as a consequence of (14)).\n4.2 Consideration of results\nThe same experimental results can be obtained using (13). Figure 7 shows the measurements of the\nmultiplication of the current, I, by the number of windings, N, as a function of the pads number placed\nunder the compass at one and the same magnetic needle's deflection angle, b . A linear dependence of\nthe current on n can be observed as all lines cross at one and the same point of the X \u2013 axis equal to\n- z 0 / d . The obtained graph verifies (13).\n\n\fI.N, A\n6.00\n\nb = 75\n\n5.00\n\nb = 60\nb = 45\nb = 30\nb = 15\n\n4.00\n\n3.00\n\n2.00\n\n1.00\n\nn\n\n0.00\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nFigure 7.

The variation could be explained by the scale divisions of the compass used in the setup. Each one represents 3 0 which makes it possible for accidental errors of up to 0.5 0 to occur in the\nangle.\nFigure 8 shows the theoretical dependence and the experimental data of the relation between the\nmagnetic field B(h ) at the height of h over the planar coil of wires B(0) as a height function over it.\nThe graph displays that the planar coil of wires magnetic field is close to the theoretical curve (8) at\nthe distance of up to 4 cm over it.

Conclusion\nTo sum up, a theoretical analysis of the interaction between the compass magnetic needle and the\ncurrent-carrying wire's magnetic field has been done. The possibility to use a horizontal coil of wires\nas a sinus-galvanometer has been shown and tested by experiment.\nTherefore, we ascertain the magnetic field of the planar coil of wires is close to its theoretical\nvalue at the distance of up to 4 cm over it, taking into account the measuring accuracy of the needle's\ndeflection angle. Hence, the planar coil of wires can be used as a model for a straight infinite currentcarrying wire in demonstrations or can be given as an assignment to students in Physics laboratory\nworkshops.\nReferences\n[1] Dimitar G Stoyanov 2009 A modification of the Oersted experiment Eur.
