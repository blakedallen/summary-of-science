Zheludev\n\narXiv:cond-mat/0503212v1 [cond-mat.other] 9 Mar 2005\n\nEPSRC NanoPhotonics Portfolio Centre,\nSchool of Physics and Astronomy,\nUniversity of Southampton, SO17 1BJ, UK\n(Dated: November 5, 2018)\nIn a single gallium nanoparticulate, self-assembled (from an atomic beam) in a nano-aperture at\nthe tip of a tapered optical fiber, we have observed evidence for a sequence of reversible light-induced\ntransformations between five different structural phases (\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b5 \u2192 \u03b4 \u2192 \u03b2 \u2192 liquid), stimulated by\noptical excitation at nanowatt power levels.\n\nIn this letter we report experimental evidence for a\nsequence of light-induced structural phase transformations involving five different phases in a single gallium\nnanoparticulate. Our results are consistent with predictions that phase transitions in nano-volumes of material\nare achieved through continuous and reversible surfacedriven coexistences of different forms [1, 2], and demonstrate that such transformations can be stimulated and\ncontrolled by extremely low power optical excitation. We\nhave been able to induce and monitor transitions between\nphases that differ in free energy by only a fraction of\nan meV per atom and found that the nanoparticulate's\nstructural response to optical excitation settles within\na few tens of microseconds. We observed that a particulate probed with low intensity cw laser light can be\novercooled by more than 90 K before it returns to the\nlow-temperature phase, but that under a regime of more\nintense pulsed optical excitation this overcooling hysteresis collapses.\nWith such techniques as confocal microscopy, 'optical\ntweezers' and scanning near-field imaging it is now possible to detect photoluminescence and Raman spectra\nand perform sophisticated transient spectroscopic measurements on single nanoparticles [3, 4, 5, 6] - essentially removing the inhomogeneous broadening characteristic of nanoparticle film spectroscopy. In nanoparticles, phase transition temperatures and optical absorption cross-sections depend strongly on particle size, so\ninhomogeneous broadening in nanoparticle films masks\nthe characteristic changes in optical properties that accompany a transition. Studying transitions in a single\nnanoparticulate, as opposed to a nanoparticle film [7, 8],\nleads to advantages similar to the resolution improvements achieved in the optical spectroscopy of single particles.\nWe studied a single nanoparticulate, grown from an\natomic beam, at the tip of a tapered optical fiber with\na nano-aperture at its end. This location allows for precise coupling of optical excitations to the particulate for\nthe stimulation of phase transformations, and simultaneously for collection of a probe signal reflected by the\nparticulate and used to monitor its state. We used a\ngold-coated silica single-mode fiber tapered to a 100 nm\n\nFIG. 1: Experimental arrangement for studying light-induced\nstructural transformations in a single gallium nanoparticulate.

It was attached to a\nliquid nitrogen cryostat cold-finger at 80 K inside a vacuum chamber evacuated to \u223c 10\u22126 mbar. To grow the\nnanoparticulate, a gallium atomic beam with a mass flux\nof f \u223c 0.3 nm/min was directed at the end of the fiber\nfor t = 60 min (Fig. 1a). The formation of a particulate in the nano-aperture was indicated by a change in\nthe reflectivity of the fiber tip during deposition (we assume that, at least on formation, the particulate fills the\naperture and therefore has a diameter equal to that of\nthe aperture, i.e. 100 nm). A cw diode laser operating\n\n\f2\nat 1310 nm was used as a probe and another at 1550\nnm, typically modulated at \u03bd = 2.3 kHz, was used as\nthe pump. The reflected probe signal was monitored using an InGaAs photodetector and a digital lock-in amplifier (locked on the frequency \u03bd). A wavelength-division\nmultiplexer (WDM) and bandpass filter prevented reflected pump light from reaching the photodetector (see\nFig. 1b). Structural transformations were observed by\nmonitoring pump-beam-induced changes in the reflectivity of the particulate as a function of temperature between 80 and 300 K (varied at a rate of \u223c 2 K/min) using pump and probe powers of 30 and 20 nW respectively\nat the nano-aperture. While increasing the temperature\nof the nanoparticulate we observe several narrow peaks\nin the induced-reflectivity-change signal at temperatures\nbetween 200 and 250 K, as shown in Fig. 2a (no features\nare observed outside the range shown). Positive and negative peaks correspond to pump-induced increases and\ndecreases in nanoparticulate reflectivity. When repeating\nthe heating cycle the peaks appear at the same positions,\nalthough their relative heights may vary slightly.\nSubstantial changes in the optical properties of the\nnanoparticulate may occur when it undergoes a transition between two structural phases. Such changes\nare typically much more dramatic than temperaturedependent variations occurring within a single phase.\nIndeed, in the case of gallium, differences between the\nelectronic density of states of its various phases [9] lead\nto pronounced differences between their optical dielectric coefficients. A phase change in a galluim nanoparticulate thus affects its optical absorption cross-section\n[10], and in the present case will change the reflectivity of the nano-aperture hosting the particulate. One\nmay thus detect phase transformations in a nanoparticulate by monitoring its optical properties. A peculiarity\nof confined solids is that their structural transformations\ntake the form of a dynamic coexistence between different\nphases (as opposed to an abrupt transition) [1, 2], with\nthe surface of a particle (where atoms have fewer nearest neighbors than internal atoms) acting as a boundary\nat which transformations start [11, 12]. In the presence\nof optical excitation, the phase equilibrium (and therefore in the present case the reflectivity of the particle)\nis determined by both temperature and the level of electronic excitation [13]. In the current experiment, incident laser light leads to both electronic excitation and a\nlocal temperature increase, which simultaneously affect\nthe phase equilibrium. To detail this process further, we\nmay consider a nanoparticle consisting of a core in one\nstructural phase covered by a shell of a different phase.\nWith increasing temperature or level of excitation, the\nshell layer's thickness increases and the optical properties of the particle change continuously from those of the\ncore phase to those of the surface phase. If the temperature or level of optical excitation is reduced before the\ntransformation to the new phase is complete, i.e. while a\n\nnucleus of the core phase is still present, the transformation is reversed, the skin layer shrinks to an appropriate\nequilibrium position and the reflectivity returns to its\noriginal level. However, when the core is fully consumed\nby the surface phase the particle becomes stable against\na return to the core phase because this would require\nthe creation of a nucleation center. At this point the\napplied excitation abruptly ceases to induce any significant change in the particle's optical properties, until the\ntemperature approaches the next phase transition point.\nThis type of optical response, i.e. one based on reversible,\nexcitation-induced structural transformations, has been\nobserved previously at bulk gallium/glass interfaces [14]\nand in gallium nanoparticle films [7, 8] but these experiments did not resolve the fine structure of transitions\ninvolving multiple phases.\nThe pump-induced reflectivity change signal observed\nduring the cooling of the nanoparticulate (see Fig. 2c)\nis very different from that observed during heating. It\nis about two orders of magnitude smaller and instead\nof sharp peaks there are abrupt step-changes in the signal at certain temperatures. With the much smaller signal level, there are fewer discernable steps in the cooling\npart of the temperature cycle than peaks in the heating part, and they occur at temperatures different from\nthose of any of the peaks. Some of these features can\nbe explained by overcooling: with decreasing temperature the particulate remains in a given phase until its\ntemperature is somewhat lower than the normal phase\ntransition temperature and in these conditions pump excitation produces very little signal. When the overcooled\nparticulate transforms abruptly into a lower energy phase\nthe pump-induced probe modulation is again small because this change happens at a temperature far below the\nincreasing-temperature signal peak for that phase. Thus,\npeak I and step A correspond respectively to transitions\ninto and out of the highest temperature phase, implying\nthat it overcools by \u223c 45 K; and step C and peak V\nare associated with transitions into and out of the lowest\ntemperature phase, which overcools by \u223c 90 K.\nPeak I can confidently be attributed to a transition\nfrom a solid state to the liquid. An X-ray diffraction\nstudy of gallium nanoparticles found that \u03b1-gallium, the\nstable solid state of bulk gallium, is completely absent in\nsmall particles [15] so it follows from Defrain's analysis of\nthe free energies of gallium's metastable phases [16] that\nthe only possible sequence of structural transformations\nin gallium particles is \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b5 \u2192 \u03b4 \u2192 \u03b2 \u2192 liquid (\u03b3, \u03b5, \u03b4, \u03b2\nall crystalline). This sequence is in agreement with the\nestablished phase diagram for gallium shown in Fig. 3\n(the pressure inside the particulate may be estimated us2\n1\ning the Laplace-Young equation P = 4\u03c3\n3 ( d + h ) where \u03c3\n\u22122\nis the surface tension \u223c 0.7 J.m for the liquid phase,\nd = 100 nm is the particle diameter, and h = f t = 18\nnm is its height, giving P \u223c 0.1 GP a). Thus, peak I,\nat TI = 248 K in Fig. 2a, may be attributed to a transi-\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 2: (a) Magnitude (Rpump \u2212 R0 ) of pump-induced reflectivity change for a gallium nanoparticulate as a function of\nincreasing temperature (Rpump = reflectivity with pump illumination, R0 = reflectivity with no pump present. cw probe\npower at particulate \u223c 20 nW , pump peak power \u223c 30 nW , plotted temp. = measured temp.).

Note that the\nrecorded temperature of the coldfinger is somewhat lower than the actual temperature of the nanoparticulate due to localized\nlaser-heating.\n\ntion from monoclinic \u03b2-gallium to the melt, peak II (at\nTII = 246 K) to a transition from rhombic \u03b4-gallium to\n\u03b2-gallium and peak III (at TIII = 237 K) to a transition\nfrom \u03b5-gallium (of unknown point group) to \u03b4-gallium.\nAssigning transitions to peak IV (at TIV = 225 K) and\nthe more structured peak V (at TV = 216 K) is more difficult. We will assume that the \u03b3 phase, which is strongly\nrepresented in gallium nanoparticle X-ray spectra [15],\nis the most likely candidate for the ground state (lowest\ntemperature) phase of the particulate, in which case peak\nV is probably associated with a transition from \u03b3-gallium\nto \u03b5-gallium. We believe that peak IV (the smallest of\nthe five) corresponds to a change in the nanoparticulate's\nshape rather than its phase: The optical cross-section\nof a nanoparticulate depends strongly on its shape so a\nparticulate's reflectivity may also change when its shape\nchanges. This argument is supported by measurements\nof the retardation between pump and probe modulations,\nwhich relates to the non-instantaneous relaxation of the\nhigh-energy phase back into the low energy phase following withdrawal of the optical excitation. Small retarda-\n\ntion changes (\u223cfew degrees) are resolved in the vicinity\nof peaks V and III, and to a lesser extent around peaks\nI and II, indicating that the relaxation time increases\nby 5 \u2212 10 \u03bcs close to these peaks. For peak IV the retardation is at least an order of magnitude larger than for\nthe other peaks - suggesting that the associated transition is different from the others. In the absence of any\ndata on the dielectric constants of gallium's metastable\ncrystalline phases, no information on the phase transition sequence can be derived from the signs or relative\nmagnitudes of the peaks in Fig. 2a.\nReplacing the cw pump beam with a 20 kHz train of 3\nns pulses (at the same wavelength) dramatically changes\nthe phase transition pattern. Such data are presented in\nFig. 2b, where the temperature scale has been shifted by\n65 K to compensate for the strong heating effect induced\nby the short pulses and bring the peak pattern back\ninto line with the cw-pump data in Fig. 1a. (Thermodynamic calculations confirm that the energy absorbed\nby the nanoparticulate cannot dissipate during the pulse\nand therefore rapidly increases its temperature.) For the\n\n\f4\nindependent, non-thermal mechanism where the phase\nchange is caused by band-structure collapse and lattice\ninstability resulting from electronic excitation [13, 19].\nTo summarize, we have for the first time investigated\nlight-induced structural transformations in a single gallium nanoparticulate and observed evidence for a sequence of reversible transformations between five different structural phases. The low energy requirements\nfor such optically induced phase transitions, and the\nnanoparticulate's phase stability on overcooling could\nprovide a means of creating key logical and bistable memory elements for nanophotonic devices operating at extremely low power levels.\nFIG. 3: Phase diagram for (bulk) gallium after Bosio [17]\nshowing the sequence of phase transitions expected in a gallium nanoparticulate undergoing adiabatic heating from 180\nto 300 K (The \u03b1 phase is not found in nanoparticles so \u03b2\ntransforms directly to liquid.)\n\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of the EPSRC (UK) and Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a\nCi\u00eancia e Tecnologia (Portugal).\n\npulsed regime of excitation, the optical changes associated with the phase transitions are very similar in both\ndirections of temperature, the magnitude of induced reflectivity changes is much smaller than for cw excitation\nand there is very little overcooling. With increasing temperature, peaks I and V are still present but the large\npeak at position III is replaced by a much smoother,\nbroader feature. With decreasing temperature, the same\nmajor peaks are seen with overcooling of only \u223c 2 K for\npeak I and \u223c 5 K for peak V . Peaks II and IV from the\ncw scan cannot be identified. The near-disappearance of\novercooling may result from the fact that a short intense\npump pulse may help a slightly overcooled nanoparticulate to change from the high temperature phase to the low\ntemperature phase by rapidly providing sufficient energy\nfor it to get through the potential barrier between the\nphases as in the 'explosive crystallization' effect where\na localized energy input stimulates an abrupt transition\nfrom an overcooled liquid state to the solid state [18].\nThe light-induced structural transitions are observed\nat very low levels of optical excitation. Such levels can be\nused because the differences \u2206G between the free energies\nof some of the metastable phases involved are very small:\nfor example, \u2206G\u03b2\u2212\u03b4 = 0.3 meV /atom, \u2206G\u03b3\u2212\u03b4 = 17\nmeV /atom [16]. Thus, the absorbtion of a 'pump' quantum with an energy of 0.8 eV should be sufficient to convert about 500 atoms from the \u03b3 phase to the \u03b4 phase,\nand about 2700 atoms from the \u03b4 phase to the \u03b2 phase.\nThe light-induced transitions are likely to be driven primarily by thermal excitation (i.e. laser-induced heating)\nbut there may also be a contribution from a temperature-\n\n[1] R.
