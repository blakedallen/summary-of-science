Coan\nPhysics Department, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX 75275, USA\nE-mail: coan@mail.physics.smu.edu\n\nAbstract\nThe CLEO collaboration at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR)\nis proposing a three-year experiment\nthat specifically emphasizes charm and QCD\n\u221a\nstudies in the energy range s = 3\u20135 GeV, utilizes the existing detector and requires\nminimal modification of CESR to produce a luminosity L = (1\u22125)\u00d71032 cm\u22122 sec\u22121 .\nKey features of this \"CLEO-c\" physics program are summarized.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe impressive performance of the asymmetric B-factories at KEK and SLAC in the\n\u03a5(4S) region and the large integrated luminosities (\u223c 400 fb\u22121) the corresponding\ndetectors, Belle and BaBar, are projected to collect in the next few years renders\nadditional contributions to B-meson physics by CLEO problematic. Correspondingly, CLEO seeks to exploit its extensive experience in heavy flavor physics and\nthe excellent performance of its nearly hermetic detector to perform focused studies\n\u221a\nof charm and QCD physics in the energy range s = 3 \u2212 5 GeV. Indeed, CLEO no\n\u221a\nlonger runs at s \u223c \u03a5(4S) but began a year long program in November 2001 to run\nR\n\u221a\nat s = \u03a5(1S), \u03a5(2S), \u03a5(3S) and to collect Ldt = 1 \u2212 2 fb\u22121 at each resonance.\nThis data set is a factor of 10 \u2212 20 larger than the existing world data set of similar\ntype and will provide 2 \u2212 3% measurements of leptonic widths and precise measurements of a wide range of precision branching fractions to complement the proposed\nQCD studies 1) .\nThe CLEO-c proposal 2) entails a 3-year run plan at \"charm production\"\n\u221a\nR\nthreshold: running at s = \u03a8(3770) (D D\u0304 threshold) in 2003 and collecting Ldt =\n\u221a\nR\n3 fb\u22121; running in 2004 at s \u223c 4100 MeV (Ds D\u0304s threshold) and collecting Ldt =\nR\n\u221a\n3 fb\u22121; and running in 2005 at s = J/\u03a8(3100) and collecting Ldt = 1 fb\u22121 . These\nintegrated luminosities represent data sets that are a factor of 15 \u2212 500 larger than\ncorresponding data sets of BES II and MARK III.\nA focussed set of precision measurements of charm absolute branching fractions and spectroscopy of cc\u0304 quarkonia is the core of the CLEO-c physics program.\nThe physics reach has been carefully simulated using analysis tools and detector understanding acquired by the CLEO collaboration from many years of heavy quark\nstudies. Measurement of D and Ds leptonic decays permit determinations of the\ndecays constants fD and fDs , respectively. Measurements of semileptonic decays\nwill yield precision determinations of semileptonic form factors and the CKM matrix elements Vcd and Vcs and so provide a check of the unitarity of the matrix\nitself. Semileptonic form factors can also be accurately determined. Precise charm\nabsolute branching fractions will normalize important B decay measurements and\nprovide a robust means of verifying and calibrating theoretical techniques of heavy\nquark effective theory (HQET) and lattice gauge theory that can in turn be applied\nto the b sector to improve measurements of CKM matrix elements Vub , Vcb, Vtd and\nVts .\nHigh statistics samples of cc\u0304 data (as well as bb\u0304 data from the \u03a8(nS)\nruns now underway) will permit efficient searches for purely gluonic \"glueballs\" and\n2\n\n\fquark-gluon \"hybrids\" in the mass range 1.5 \u2212 2.5 GeV/c2 . The existence of such\nexotic states is an unambiguous prediction of QCD and the unambiguous detection\nof such states is of fundamental importance. Determination of the J P C quantum\nnumbers through partial wave analysis, as well as measurements of decay widths\nand branching fractions of putative exotic states, will clarify the gluonic content of\nexotic candidates. Additionally, CLEO-c will have sensitivity to physics beyond the\nStandard Model by mounting searches for D D\u0304-mixing, CP violation in the charm\nsector, and searches for a host of rare D and \u03c4 decays.\nMinimal modifications to CESR are required to implement the lower energy\n\u221a\nrunning in the range s = 3 \u2212 5 GeV. Supplemental radiation damping will be\ninduced to produce transverse cooling by the insertion of 18 meters of 2 T wiggler\nmagnets so that the luminosity scales as L \u223c s rather than the naive L \u223c s2\nexpectation. The design luminosity is L = (1 \u2212 5) \u00d7 1032 cm\u22122 s\u22121 , depending on\n\u221a\n\u221a\ns, with an anticipated beam energy uncertainty \u03c3B \u223c 1.2 MeV at s = J/\u03a8.\nPrototype wiggler design and construction are well advanced.\n2\n\nCharm Threshold Running\n\nCLEO-c will not be able to compete against the asymmetric B factory detectors run\u221a\nning at s = \u03a5(4S) in the raw number of charm events collected. However, running\nat charm threshold production has distinct advantages over continuum e+ e\u2212 \u2192 cc\u0304\nproduction. For example, the charged and neutral multiplicities in \u03a8(3770) events\nare only 5.0 and 2.4, respectively, reducing combinatorics and leading to high detection efficiencies and low systematic errors. Additionally, charm events at threshold\n\u2217\nare pure D D\u0304, including the \u03a8(4140) decaying into D D\u0304 \u2217 , Ds D\u0304s and Ds D\u0304s . No\nadditional particles from fragmentation are produced.\nLow multiplicity events and pure D D\u0304 states, coupled with the relatively\nhigh branching fractions typical of D decays, permit the efficient implementation\nof \"double tag\" studies where one D is fully reconstructed and the other is studied\nin a bias free fashion. This permits the determination of absolute branching fractions with very low backgrounds. In leptonic and semileptonic decays, the missing\nneutrino can be treated as a missing mass problem, with a missing mass resolution better than one pion mass. Finally, the quantum coherence of the D D\u0304 states\nproduced in \u03a8(3770) \u2192 D D\u0304 and \u03a8(4140) \u2192 \u03b3D D\u0304 decays permit relatively simple\ntechniques 3) for measuring D D\u0304 mixing parameters and direct CP violation.\n\n3\n\n\f3\n\nAbsolute Branching Fractions\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\nThe combination of pure D D\u0304(Ds D\u0304s ) at s = \u03a8(3770) ( s = 4140 MeV), typical\ncharm branching fractions of (1 \u2212 15)%, and a high reconstruction efficiency for\nD-mesons, lead to a high net D-meson tagging efficiency of \u223c 15% for CLEO-c.\nKey selection criteria for D candidates include constraints on the energy difference\nbetween the D candidate and the beam energy, the beam constrained mass of the\nD candidate, and particle identification cuts. Figure 1 shows the reconstructed\nD 0 mass for simulated D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + decays (left) and the reconstructed Ds mass\nfor the Ds \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + mode. Only 1 fb\u22121 out of the target 3 fb\u22121 of integrated\nluminosity is plotted and the effects of sequential selection cuts are indicated. Note\nthe logarithmic vertical scale.\nThe technique for tagging a single D candidate can of course be extended\nto the second D-meson candidate in e+ e\u2212 \u2192 cc\u0304 threshold production events by essentially applying the single-tag technique twice. Some additional constraints on the\nflavor-defining charge of the second D candidate, overall event topology, and overall\nevent energy and invariant mass are applied to produce \"double-tag\" D candidates.\nUsing a modified version of a technique developed at MARK III 4) , CLEO-c can\nthen precisely measure absolute hadronic charm meson branching fractions using\ndouble-tag events. Figure 2 shows the reconstructed D mass from the D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 +\nmode (left) and from the D + \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + mode. In both cases the distribution is\nmade after another D of the opposite flavor has been found in the event and only\n1 fb\u22121 of simulated data out of the anticipated 3 fb\u22121 is used. Note the almost complete absence of background in both distributions.

A measurement of the form\nfactor in the same decay mode with a line fit to the data points (right).\nRadiative J/\u03a8 decays are a fruitful environment to search for glue rich\nhadronic matter 9) and CLEO-c will collect roughly 60 million J/\u03a8 \u2192 \u03b3X decays\nwith its projected 1 fb\u22121 of integrated luminosity from J/\u03a8 running. The excellent\nenergy resolution (\u03c3E = 4 MeV at E\u03b3 = 100 MeV) and large solid angle coverage of\nCLEO's calorimeter will permit efficient use of partial wave analyses to determine\nabsolute branching fraction for scalar resonances X \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0, KK, \u03b7\u03b7, pp\u0304.\nFor example, with CLEO-c's projected data set and if the branching fraction measurements from BES 10) are indeed correct for the fJ (2220), then CLEO-c\nwill see many thousands of events in a variety of exclusive fJ (2220) decay modes.\nFigure 5 shows the invariant mass spectrum for J/\u03a8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 (left) and for\nJ/\u03a8 \u2192 \u03b3K + K \u2212 . Using only 1/6 of the projected data set, the fJ (2220) is clearly\ndistinguishable from the hadronic and radiative backgrounds indicated by the shaded\nregions. Firmly establishing or debunking the existence of the fJ (2220) is a CLEO-c\npriority.\nThe inclusive photon spectrum from radiative J/\u03a8 decays is also a powerful means to search for new glue-rich hadronic states. As an example, Figure 6\nshows such an inclusive photon spectrum for only 60 million J/\u03a8 decays under the\n9\n\n\fassumption B \u2192 \u03b3fJ (2220) = 8\u00d710\u22124. The fJ (2220) peak is clearly visible from the\nhadronic J/\u03a8 background shown as the shaded region. Due to its nearly hermetic\nstructure (93% of 4\u03c0), the CLEO-c detector is highly efficient at rejecting events\nof the type J/\u03a8 \u2192 \u03c0 0 X where one of the photons from the \u03c0 0 gets lost. With its\nprojected data set of 109 J/\u03a8 events, CLEO-c should be able to detect any narrow\nresonances in radiative J/\u03a8 decays with a branching fraction of O(10\u22124 ) or larger.\nAn exisiting data set of 25 fb\u22121 of \u03b3\u03b3 events will be a useful crosscheck for putative\nglue-rich states.\n6\n\nDetector Performance\n\nThe performance of the current CLEO detector is well-suited to the CLEO-c physics\nprogram. In some sense the detector is overdesigned since it was designed for run\u221a\nning at s = \u03a5(4S). Both the tracking system and the calorimeter cover 93% of\n4\u03c0 steradians, providing the near hermeticity vital for partial wave analyses and\nfor efficient background rejection. The central drift chamber has a fractional momentum resolution \u03c3p /p = 0.35% at p = 1 GeV/c and a D \u2192 K\u03c0 mass resolution\n\u03c3 \u223c 6.3 MeV. The CsI calorimeter has excellent energy resolution, \u03c3e /E = 2.2% at\nE = 1 GeV and 5\u22127 MeV \u03c0 0 mass resolution. The dedicated charged hadron identification system, a ring imaging Cherenkov detector that covers 83% of the full solid\nangle that is used in conjunction with dE/dx measurements from the drift chamber,\nprovides 10 \u2212 200 sigma K/\u03c0 separation from 470 MeV up to the kinematic limit\nfor D decay daughters at CLEO-c collision energies.\n7\n\nSummary\n\nCLEO-c is a timely proposed experiment designed to make important measurements\nin charm physics and QCD with projected data sets many orders of magnitude larger\nthan current world sets of comparable type. These measurements will provide important measurements of CKM matrix elements and strenuously test theory's description of heavy quark decay as well as QCD's prediction of exotic gluonic states\nof matter. Table 5 summarizes some important CLEO-c measurements, projecting\n3 fb\u22121 of integrated luminosity, and compares them to the expected reach of the\ncurrent asymmetric B-factories, assuming 400 fb\u22121 of integrated luminosity. The\nrelative advantages of charm threshold running lead to favorable overall errors. The\ncurrent CLEO detector is fully capable of providing measurements with the appropriate resolution in particle energy, tracking and charged hadron identification to\naccomplish CLEO-c physics goals.\n10\n\n\fTable 5: Comparison of the physics reach for some important measurements between\nCLEO-c and the asymmetric B-factories and PDG 2000 values.\nfD\nfDs\nB(D + \u2192 K\u03c0\u03c0)\nB(Ds \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0)\nB(Ds \u2192 K\u03c0)\n8\n\nCLEO-c\n2.3%\n1.7%\n0.7%\n1.9%\n0.6%\n\nB-factories PDG\n10\u201320 %\n\u2013\n6\u20139%\n19%\n3\u20135%\n7%\n5\u201310%\n25%\n2\u20133%\n2%\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nI would like to thank the conference organizers for both the invitation and the\nconference's excellent organization.
