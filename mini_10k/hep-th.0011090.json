Discussions\n\n11\n\n1. Introduction\nThe noncommutative geometry [1], proved to be an utile tool in the brane dynamics\nof string theory [2].\nThus, the low energy effective action for a p-brane in the presence of nonzero\nconstant B\u03bc\u03bd field along the brane is given by the dimensional reduction of the 10dimensional noncommutative Yang\u2013Mills model to the brane world volume [3].\nIn the limit of large field B\u03bc\u03bd , i.e. when by some matrix norm,\n\u03b1\u2032 kB\u03bc\u03bd k \u226b kg\u03bc\u03bd k,\n\n(1.1)\n\nthe noncommutativity parameter \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd is given by the inverse matrix to B [2],\n\u03b8\u03bc\u03bd = (B \u22121 )\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhile the open string metric along the brane is given by,\nG\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212(2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 )2 (Bg \u22121 B)\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(1.3)\n\nand the Yang\u2013Mills coupling,\ngY2 M =\n\n(2\u03c0)p\u22122Gs\n(\u03b1\u2032 )\n\n3\u2212p\n2\n\n,\n\n(1.4)\n\nwhere, Gs is the open string coupling. In this limit the stringy corrections decouple\nand the model is described by the effective noncommutative theory [2, 4].\n\n1\n\n\fFrom the other hand, in the case of a brane-antibrane pair or of a non-BPS\nnon-stable brane one finds in the spectrum of the effective theory tachyonic modes\nas well. In the above limit (1.1), the tachyonic mode is described by noncommutative\nscalar field(s) T with potential V (T ) (tachyonic potential) [5, 6, 7].\nThe action for brane system containing a tachyonic mode in this case looks as\none for the noncommutative scalar field interacting with U(1) gauge field [8, 9],\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n1\n\u03bc\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b2\n\u03bc\u03bd 1\np+1\nf (T ) \u2217 \u2207\u03bc T \u2217 \u2207\u03bd T \u2212 V (\u2217T ) ,\nSBrane = d x \u2212 2 \u03b7 \u03b7 F\u03bc\u03bd \u2217 F\u03b1\u03b2 + \u03b7\n4gY M\n2\n(1.5)\nwhere \u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 = diag(1, \u22121, ..., \u22121) and we put the brane tension equal to unity. In the\nabove equation all products are understood as star products, defined by\ni\n\nA \u2217 B(x) = e 2 \u03b8\n\n\u03bc\u03bd \u2202 \u2202 \u2032\n\u03bc \u03bd\n\nA(x)B(x\u2032 )\n\nx\u2032 =x\n\n.\n\n(1.6)\n\nThe star product can be viewed as one of possible representation of the algebra of\noperators acting on some Hilbert space H, integral given by the trace.\nThe tachyonic potential is known to have a local maximum at the origin and\nglobal minimum for the some constant, i.e. c-number value T\u2217 of the field. In the\ncase of superstrings the potential is even with respect to the inversion T \u2192 \u2212T , and\nthere is also minimum at \u2212T\u2217 .\nIn the case of zero gauge fields one can find a solution to the equations of motion\nof the tachyon T in the limit of the large noncommutativity parameter1 \u03b8 when the\nkinetic term is negligible in comparison with potential one in the equations of motion\n[10]. Such a solution is given by T0 = T\u2217 P (x), where P (x) is the noncommutative\nfunction corresponding to some projector P \u2217 P = P .\nIn the presence of the nontrivial gauge field one can find solution of the similar\ntype as above [11, 12]. In this case the solution implies such gauge field configurations\nfor which the tachyonic soliton is covariantly constant,\n\u2207\u03bc T0 = 0,\n\n(1.7)\n\nand requirement for noncommutativity parameter \u03b8 to be large is no more needed.\nThe meaning of these solutions consists in the description of the smaller branes\nliving on the original p-brane [13].\nTo obtain the solutions one uses only the minima of the potential and the fact\nthat the tachyonic field is covariantly constant, but not the details of the kinetic\nterm and interaction potential. If, however, one is interested in the spectrum of\nfluctuations around such a vacuum solution these details may become important.\nIn this paper we introduce the model of the noncommutative U(1)-field having\nsome relation to the tachyonic vacuum. We find and analyse solutions which neither\n1\n\nThis limit, however, should be consistent with, eq. (1.1).\n\n2\n\n\fappear in the commutative case nor fall in the class of solutions of the described\nabove projector type.\nThe plan of the paper is the following. In the next section we consider a model\nof noncommutative charged Higgs-like field whose vacuum dynamics yields a noncommutative sigma model (U-field). We give some kind of string motivation for the\nmodel under consideration, however, the model itself presents a separate interest.\nIn the third section we analyse equations of motion, local extrema, and geometrical\nmeaning of the U-field. In the fourth section we extend these results to the model\nliving on q-deformed space, which can be treated as a regularisation of the model\nabove. In the fifth section we show, that in the commutative limit one can treat\nU-field as a free scalar field surrounded with the gas of Polyakov vortices. Finally,\nwe discuss our results.\n\n2. Charged Tachyon\nConsider the noncommutative Higgs-like model of charged scalar fields (charged noncommutative tachyon) in the trivial noncommutative gauge field background. It is\ngiven by the action,\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\np+1\n\u2020\n\u2020\nS= d x\n\u03b7 \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u2217 \u2202\u03bd \u03c6 \u2212 V (\u03c6 \u2217 \u03c6 ) ,\n(2.1)\n2\n\nwhere V (*) is a potential with a nontrivial v.e.v.: |\u03c6|2 = some constant.\nThe field \u03c6 transforms in the bi-fundamental representation of the U(1) gauge\ngroup. Such fields were considered earlier in [14].\nIn general, (bi-)fundamental modes arise in the spectrum of the nonstable branes\n[8, 12]. These modes correspond to strings which have only one end on the brane.\nSince in the compactified theory a string cannot end elsewhere it was conjectured by\n[5, 15], that such modes are absent. The \"confinement\" mechanism for these modes\nis as follows. Close to the tachyonic vacuum the kinetic part of the noncommutative\ngauge field vanishes and the gauge potential starts to play the role of the Lagrange\nmultiplier for the charged currents forcing them to vanish.\nIn the case of non-compact Minkowski space there is also the possibility to have\nstrings with one end at the infinity. Although the energy cost of such strings is large\ntheir presence may change the situation. Indeed, if there is some nontrivial v.e.v. for\nthe charged field, which correspond to a tachyonic mode of the semi-infinite strings,\nthe above described mechanism does not freeze all the degrees of freedom, since there\nremain ones connected with gauge motion along the vacuum valley.\nA point in the (true) vacuum of the field \u03c6 can be parameterised by an element\nof the noncommutative U(1),\n\u03c6 \u2192 U \u2217 \u03c6,\n\n\u03c6\u2020 \u2192 \u03c6\u2020 \u2217 U \u22121 ,\n\n3\n\n(2.2)\n(2.3)\n\n\fwhere U and U \u22121 satisfy U \u2217U \u22121 = U \u22121 \u2217U = 1. U act transitively along the vacuum\nvalley.\nTo get the action describing the dynamics along the valley of the potential V\nin terms of field U, let us take a constant \u03c6 realising the minimum of the potential.\nAfter that, perform the transformation (2.2) and declare the field U dynamical. The\naction for the Goldstone U-field looks as follows,\nZ\nZ\n1\n1\np+1\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u22121\nS = 2 d x \u03b7 \u2202\u03bc U \u2217 \u2202\u03bd U = \u2212 2 dp+1 x \u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc U \u2217 U \u22121 \u2217 \u2202\u03bd U \u2217 U \u22121 , (2.4)\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\nwhere the coupling \u03bb is given by 1/\u03bb2 = \u03c6 \u2217 \u03c6\u2020 =constant.\nThe model (2.4) describes the tachyon fluctuations along the degenerate vacuum.\nIn the limit of large \u03b8 the remaining fluctuations decouple and the action (2.4)\ndescribes all the tachyonic degrees of freedom. In what follows we do not assume\nlarge or small value of the noncommutative parameter, except the Section 5 where\nwe consider the limit of small \u03b8.\nLet us note that a model of U(1)-field was considered in [16], in the limit of\nstrong noncommutativity when one can neglect the kinetic term.\n\n3. The noncommutative U -field\nConsider the case p = 2. We assume that two spatial coordinates are noncommutative,\n[x1 , x2 ] = i\u03b8,\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhile time coordinate is commutative.

If, e.g. one sets naively un = 0, for n > 0, one gets the\nsin-Gordon equation for u0 .\nLet us remark that the system (3.8,3.9) has an interesting algebraic meaning. In\norder to see it let us rewrite eq. (3.8) in the form as follows,\n2\n2\n\u00fc0 = sin(u0 \u2212 u1 ),\n\u2202t2 (u1 + u0 ) = 2 sin(u1 \u2212 u2 ),\n...\n(3.10)\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n!\nk\nX\n2\n\u2202t2\nun = (k + 1) sin(uk \u2212 uk+1 ),\n(3.11)\n\u03b8\nn=0\n\n5\n\n\fobtained by summing up the equations with labels from zero to some k.\nP\nThe conservation of the full momentum requires \u2202t2 ( \u221e\nn=0 un ) = 0. Due to\nsummation in eq.

As one can see, the equations of\nmotion possess following static solutions,\nuvac\nn = \u03c0mn ,\n\n(3.14)\n\nwhere mn are integers. Solutions with all mn even give true (stable) vacua of the\nmodel, while the presence of odd mn corresponds to excitations over these vacua.\nLet us note, that the r.h.s of the eq.(3.8) is lattice analog of an elliptic operator,\ni.e. any static solution to the eq (3.8) reduces to (3.14).2\nHowever, in the case of \"spherical symmetry\" one is justified to consider solutions\nwith punched point at the origin. This eliminates the first equation from the system\n(3.8). The remaining equations look as follows,\n2\n[n sin(un \u2212 un\u22121 ) \u2212 (n + 1) sin(un+1 \u2212 un )] = 0,\n\u03b8\n\nn = 1, 2, . . .\n\n(3.15)\n\nThe general solution to eq.

Again,\nin the case when all mn are even this solution provides a local minimum for the\nenergy, i.e. a metastable state. Conversely if there are odd mn this is an unstable\nstate.\n2\n(0)\nu\u0307n\n\n(0)\n\nHowever, one can find a nontrivial uniformly accelerating solution, un (t) = un +(a/2)t2 , where\n= 0.\n\n6\n\n\fThe solution of the type (3.16), is the lattice analog of Coulomb potential. One\ncan readily generalise the above solution to the case of arbitrary dimension p of\nthe noncommutative space. Indeed, the \"spherical symmetry\" means that solution\nshould depend only on the sum of all N\u03b4 , \u03b4 = 1, . . . , p/2 and it is given by,\nun = u0 +\n\nn\nX\n\n(\u22121)\n\nmk \u2212mk\u22121\n\narcsin\n\nk=1\n\n\u0012\n\n(k \u2212 1)!(D \u2212 1)!\ns1\n(k + D \u2212 1)!\n\n\u0013\n\n+ \u03c0mn ,\n\n(3.17)\n\nonce again, u0 and s1 are constants of integration.\nIt is worthwhile to note that due to the long range character of the Coulomb\nforce the energies corresponding to the solutions (3.16), (3.17) diverge.\nWhen \u03b8 \u2192 0, the above solutions approach the Coulomb potential respectively\nin two and p dimensions. However, there are some subtleties connected with this\nlimit which we consider in Section 5.\n\n4. U -field on a special q-space\nAs we have seen above, the equations we met, include sums over an infinite tower\nof n, which potentially may diverge. Also, if one wants to apply numerical analysis\nto our system one face the problem that the brute truncation of the tower by some\nfinite nf is inconsistent. However, one can generalise the above construction by letting\nfields live on a special q-space instead of noncommutative plane. This q-space (when\nq is 2nf -th root of unity) can be used for a regularisation of the model, because\nthe corresponding algebra has finite dimensional representations and approaches the\nalgebra of the noncommutative plane for nf \u2192 \u221e.\nThe mentioned q-space is constructed as follows. Consider more general algebra\nof quantum oscillator [17], [18] (which is related to the q-deformed Heisenberg algebra\n[19]), generated by A and \u0100,\nA \u0100 \u2212 q \u0100 A = q \u2212N ,\n\nA=a\n\nr\n\n[N]q\n,\nN\n\n\u0100 =\n\nr\n\n[N]q\n\u0101,\nN\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere [N]q = (q N \u2212 q \u2212N )/(q \u2212 q \u22121 ), while a and \u0101 correspond to usual oscillator. For\nq \u2192 1 we get A \u2192 a and \u0100 \u2192 \u0101.\nOne can, therefore, find\n\u0100A = [N]q ,\n\nA\u0100 = [N + 1]q .\n\nDefine the derivatives with respect to noncommutative coordinates, as follows\nr\nr\n1\n1\n[(A + \u0100), (*)], \u22021 (*) =\n[(A \u2212 \u0100), (*)].\n\u22022 (*) = \u2212i\n2\u03b8\n2\u03b8\n\n7\n\n\fFor q being root of unity (q 2nf = 1) one can put Anf = 0 = (\u0100)nf .

Continuum limit and Polyakov vortices\nIn this section we consider p = 4 with nondegenerate noncommutativity matrix \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\u03bc, \u03bd = 1, . . . , 4, and no time, i.e. we assume the Euclidean signature.

The presence of factor n\u03b4 ,\ncan be interpreted as the nontrivial metric background on the lattice. The exact\nmeaning of this factor will become clear when we will take the continuum (i.e. commutative) limit.\nIn fact the analysis of Ref. [20], applies also here. Indeed, consider the isotropic\nweak coupling limit \u03b2 \u2261 4/(\u03bb2\u03b8) \u2192 \u221e, of the model (5.4); we set \u03b8(1) = \u03b8(2) \u2261 \u03b8.\nIn this limit the main contributions to the partition function come from configurations where neighbour un are close modulo 2\u03c0\u00d7(integer).

Configurations with such\nvortices are suppressed in the limit \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e. Recall that \u03b2 \u223c 1/\u03b8, therefore this is\nboth continuum and commutative limit.\nIn this limit one can pass from discrete notation to continuous ones un \u2192 u(x),\nwhere x\u03b4 = (2\u03c0\u03b8)n\u03b4 . Indeed, the fact that the quantity un \u2212 un\u2212\u03b4 is small allows to\ndo this. In these notations the action for the field u becomes,\nZ\n\u0001\n1\nScont = 2\nd2 x x1 (\u22021 u)2 + x2 (\u22022 u)2 ,\n(5.11)\n\u03bbcont\n\u221a\nwhich after the change of coordinates,3 x\u03b4 \u2192 r \u03b4 = x\u03b4 /(2\u03c0), looks like fourdimensional action for the excitations which are radial in the planes (1,2) and (3,4),\nZ\n\u0001\n1\nScont = 2\n(5.12)\n2\u03c0dr 1 r 1 2\u03c0dr 2 r 2 (\u2202r1 u)2 + (\u2202r2 u)2 ,\n\u03bbcont\nwhere r 1 , and r 2 play the r\u00f4le of radii in the planes (1,2) and (3,4) respectively.\nIn the weak coupling limit the the configurations with vortices enters with a\nfactor exp(\u2212\u03b2 \u00d7 constant), and are exponentially suppressed. In the strong coupling\nlimit the r\u00f4le of vortices become important.\n3\n\nRemember that x\u03b4 \u2265 0.\n\n10\n\n\f6. Discussions\nIn this paper we considered noncommutative charged tachyonic field. We have shown,\nthat the vacuum dynamics of this field is described by the noncommutative U-field.\nThe model under consideration exhibits a tight relation to conventional lattice\nmodels. The similar relation was met also in the IKKT model, which is closely\nrelated to the noncommutative (super)Yang\u2013Mills model [24], where it was shown\nthe fermionic doubling, a phenomenon well known on the lattice.\nSo far, we considered both classical solutions and partition function for excitations which possess the noncommutative analog of spherical symmetry.\nWe have shown, that the system of these excitations is equivalent to one of\nrotators on an inhomogeneous lattice. This system has a reach structure of vacua.\nThe limit of small noncommutativity corresponds to the weak coupling limit for\nthe rotators. Thus, in the case of four Euclidean dimensions, this limit yields a\nfree scalar field surrounded by the gas of exponentially suppressed vortices. As the\nnoncommutativity parameter increases the vortex gas become more important, which\nmay signal phase transitions. Since this corresponds to the string limit, perhaps the\nvortices can be identified with fundamental strings.\nIt is interesting to note that, with departing the origin the effective interaction\nweakens regardless how strong it was at origin. Therefore, far enough from origin\none always has weak coupled regime, which means that the vortices cannot depart\nfar from there.\nWe analysed the radial part of the noncommutative sigma model. It would be\ninteresting to extend this analysis also to the noncommutative analogs of spherical\nharmonics (of course, if one succeed to define them).\nAlso, in the light of a recent paper [25], the Higgs mechanism may play some\nimportant r\u00f4le in the vacuum structure of the string field theory, which in the low\nenergy limit reduces to the noncommutative Higgs model considered in Ref. [26, 14],\nto which our model is relevant.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to A. Pashnev, S. Sergeev and K.
