Let F be a surface and suppose that \u03c6 : F \u2192 F is a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism, fixing a puncture p of F . The mapping torus M = M\u03c6 is hyperbolic and contains a\nmaximal cusp C about the puncture p.\nWe show that the area (and height) of the cusp torus \u2202C is equal to the stable translation\ndistance of \u03c6 acting on the arc complex A(F, p), up to an explicitly bounded multiplicative\nerror. Our proof relies on elementary facts about the hyperbolic geometry of pleated surfaces. In particular, the proof of this theorem does not use any deep results from Teichm\u00fcller\ntheory, Kleinian group theory, or the coarse geometry of A(F, p).\nA similar result holds for quasi-Fuchsian manifolds N \u223c\n= F \u00d7 R. In that setting, we find\na combinatorial estimate for the area (and height) of the cusp annulus in the convex core of\nN , up to explicitly bounded multiplicative and additive error. As an application, we show\nthat covers of punctured surfaces induce quasi-isometric embeddings of arc complexes.\n\n1. Introduction\nFollowing the work of Thurston, Mostow, and Prasad, it has been known for over three\ndecades that almost every 3\u2013manifold with torus boundary admits a hyperbolic structure [37],\nwhich is necessarily unique up to isometry [30, 33]. Thus, in principle, it is possible to translate combinatorial data about a 3\u2013manifold into a detailed description of its geometry -\nand conversely, to use geometry to identify topological features. Indeed, given a triangulated\nmanifold (up to over 100 tetrahedra) the computer program SnapPy can typically approximate the manifold's hyperbolic metric to a high degree of precision [17]. However, building\nan effective dictionary between combinatorial and geometric features, for all but the most\nspecial families of manifolds, has proven elusive. The prevalence of hyperbolic geometry\nmakes this one of the central open problems in low-dimensional topology.\n1.1. Fibered 3\u2013manifolds. In this paper, we attack this problem for the class of hyperbolic 3\u2013manifolds that fiber over the circle. Let F be a connected, orientable surface with\n\u03c7(F ) < 0, and (for this paper) with at least one puncture. Given an orientation-preserving\nhomeomorphism \u03c6 : F \u2192 F we construct the mapping torus\n.\nM\u03c6 := F \u00d7 [0, 1] (x, 1) \u223c (\u03c6(x), 0) .\nThus M\u03c6 fibers over S 1 , with fiber F and monodromy \u03c6. Thurston showed that M\u03c6 is hyperbolic if and only if \u03c6 is pseudo-Anosov : equivalently, if and only if \u03c6n (\u03b3) is not homotopic\nto \u03b3 for any n 6= 0 and any essential simple closed curve \u03b3 \u2282 F [37, 38]. See also Otal [32].\nIn addition to the connection with dynamics, fibered 3\u2013manifolds are of central importance\nDate: October 14, 2018.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 57M50, 57M60, 30F40.\nFuter is supported in part by NSF grant DMS\u20131007221.\nSchleimer is supported in part by EPSRC grant EP/I028870/1.\nThis work is in the public domain.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nDAVID FUTER AND SAUL SCHLEIMER\n\nin low-dimensional topology because every finite-volume, non-positively curved 3\u2013manifold\nhas a finite\u2013sheeted cover that fibers [2, 34].\nFor those fibered 3\u2013manifolds that are hyperbolic, the work of Minsky, Brock, and Canary\non Kleinian surface groups provides a combinatorial, bi-Lipschitz model of the hyperbolic\nmetric [29]. The bi-Lipschitz constants depend only on the fiber F [11]. However, the\nexistence of these constants is proved using compactness arguments; as a result the constants\nare unknown.\nUsing related ideas, Brock established the following notable entry in the dictionary between\ncombinatorics and geometry.\nTheorem 1.1 (Brock [9, 10]). Let F be an orientable surface with \u03c7(F ) < 0. Then there\nexist positive constants K1 and K2 , depending only on F , such that the following holds. For\nevery orientation-preserving, pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism \u03c6 : F \u2192 F , the mapping torus\nM\u03c6 is a hyperbolic 3\u2013manifold satisfying\nK1 dP (\u03c6) \u2264 vol(M\u03c6 ) \u2264 K2 dP (\u03c6).\nHere P(F ) is the adjacency graph of pants decompositions of F . Also dP (\u03c6) is the stable\ntranslation distance of \u03c6 in P(F ), defined in Equation (1.2) below.\nThe constant K2 in the upper bound can be made explicit. Agol showed that the sharpest\npossible value for K2 is 2v8 , where v8 = 3.6638... is the volume of a regular ideal octahedron\n[4]. On the other hand, the constant K1 is only known in the special case when F is a\npunctured torus or 4\u2013puncture sphere; see Gu\u00e9ritaud and Futer [23, Appendix B]. For all\nother surfaces, it remains an open problem to give an explicit estimate for K1 .\nBrock's theorem is a template for obtaining combinatorial information; the pants graph\nP(F ) is just one of many complexes naturally associated to a surface F . Others include the\ncurve complex C(F ) and the arc complex A(F ); the latter is the main focus of this paper.\nUsing A(F ) we give effective two-sided estimates for the geometry of maximal cusps in M\u03c6 .\nDefinition 1.2. Suppose F is a surface of negative Euler characteristic, connected and\norientable, without boundary and with at least one puncture. The arc complex A(F ) is the\nsimplicial complex whose vertices are proper isotopy classes of essential arcs from puncture\nto puncture. Simplices are collections of vertices admitting pairwise disjoint representatives.\nWe engage in the standard abuse of notation by using the same symbol for an arc and its\nisotopy class.\nThe 1\u2013skeleton A(1) (F ) has a combinatorial metric. For a pair of vertices v, w \u2208 A(0) (F ),\nthe distance d(v, w) is the minimal number of edges required to connect v to w. This is\nwell-defined, because A(F ) is connected [24].\nWhen F has a preferred puncture p, we define the subcomplex A(F, p) \u2282 A(F ) whose\nvertices are arcs with at least one endpoint at p. The 1\u2013skeleton A(1) (F, p) is again connected.\nThe distance dA (v, w) is the minimal number of edges required to connect v to w inside of\nA(1) (F, p).\nThe mapping class group MCG(F ) acts on A(F ) by isometries. In fact, Irmak and McCarthy showed [26] that, apart from a few low-complexity exceptions, MCG(F ) \u223c\n= Isom A(F ).\nSimilarly, the subgroup of MCG(F ) that fixes the puncture p acts on A(F, p) by isometries.\nWe are interested in the geometric implications of this action.\nDefinition 1.3. Let \u03c6 : F \u2192 F be a homeomorphism fixing p. Define the translation distance\nof \u03c6 in A(F, p) to be\n(1.1)\n\ndA (\u03c6) = min{dA (v, \u03c6(v)) | v \u2208 A(0) (F, p)}.\n\n\fCUSP GEOMETRY OF FIBERED 3\u2013MANIFOLDS\n\n3\n\nThe same definition applies in any simplicial complex where MCG(F ) acts by isometries.\nWe also define the stable translation distance of \u03c6 to be\ndA (v, \u03c6n (v))\n, for an arbitrary vertex v \u2208 A(0) (F, p),\nn\u2192\u221e\nn\nand similarly for other MCG\u2013complexes. It is a general property of isometries of metric\nspaces that the limit in (1.2) exists and does not depend on the base vertex v [8, Section\n6.6]. In addition, the triangle inequality implies that dA (\u03c6) \u2264 dA (\u03c6).\n\n(1.2)\n\ndA (\u03c6) = lim\n\nNote that applying equation (1.2) to the pants graph P(F ) gives the stable translation\ndistance dP (\u03c6) that estimates volume in Theorem 1.1. In the same spirit, one may ask the\nfollowing.\nQuestion 1.4. Let S(F ) be a simplicial complex associated to a surface F , on which the\nmapping class group MCG(F ) acts by isometries. How are the dynamics of the action of\n\u03c6 \u2208 MCG(F ) on S(F ) reflected in the geometry of the mapping torus M\u03c6 ?\nWe answer this question for the arc complex of a once-punctured surface F or, more\ngenerally, for the sub-complex A(F, p) of a surface with many punctures. Here, the stable\ndistance dA (\u03c6) predicts the cusp geometry of M\u03c6 .\n1.2. Cusp area from the arc complex. Let M be a 3\u2013manifold whose boundary is a nonempty union of tori, such that the interior of M supports a complete hyperbolic metric. In\nthis metric, every non-compact end of M is a cusp, homeomorphic to T 2 \u00d7 [0, \u221e). Geometrically, each cusp is a quotient of a horoball in H3 by a Z \u00d7 Z group of deck transformations.\nWe call this geometrically standard end a horospherical cusp neighborhood or horocusp.\nAssociated to each torus T \u2282 \u2202M is a maximal cusp C = CT . That is, C is the closure of\nC \u25e6 \u2282 M , where C \u25e6 is the largest embedded open horocusp about T . The same construction\nworks in dimension 2: every punctured hyperbolic surface has a maximal cusp about each\npuncture.\nIn dimension 3, Mostow\u2013Prasad rigidity implies that the geometry of a maximal cusp\nC \u2282 M is completely determined by the topology of M . One may compute that area(\u2202C) =\n1\n2 vol(C). The Euclidean geometry of \u2202C is an important invariant that carries a wealth of\ninformation about Dehn fillings of M . For example, if a slope s (an isotopy class of simple\nclosed curve on \u2202C) is sufficiently long, then Dehn filling M along s produces a hyperbolic\nmanifold [3, 27], whose volume can be estimated in terms of the length `(s) [20].\nIn our setting, M\u03c6 is a fibered hyperbolic 3\u2013manifold, with fiber a punctured surface F .\nThe maximal cusp torus \u2202C contains a canonical slope, called the longitude of C, which\nencircles a puncture of F . The Euclidean length of the longitude is denoted \u03bb. Any other,\nnon-longitude slope on \u2202C must have length at least\n(1.3)\n\nheight(\u2202C) := area(\u2202C)/\u03bb.\n\nAs discussed in the previous paragraph, lower bounds on height(\u2202C) imply geometric control\nover Dehn fillings of M\u03c6 .\nOur main result in this paper uses the action of \u03c6 on A(F, p) to give explicit estimates on\nthe area and height of the cusp torus \u2202C.\nTheorem 1.5. Let F be a surface with a preferred puncture p, and let \u03c6 : F \u2192 F be any\norientation-preserving, pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism. In the mapping torus M\u03c6 , let C be\nthe maximal cusp that corresponds to p. Let \u03c8 = \u03c6n be the smallest positive power of \u03c6 with\nthe property that \u03c8(p) = p. Then\n\n\f4\n\nDAVID FUTER AND SAUL SCHLEIMER\n\ndA (\u03c8)\n< area(\u2202C) \u2264 9 \u03c7(F )2 dA (\u03c8).\n450 \u03c7(F )4\nSimilarly, the height of the cusp relative to a longitude satisfies\ndA (\u03c8)\n< height(\u2202C) < \u22123 \u03c7(F ) dA (\u03c8).\n536 \u03c7(F )4\nIf the surface F has only one puncture p, the statement of Theorem 1.5 becomes simpler\nin several ways. In this special case, we have n = 1, hence \u03c8 = \u03c6. There is only one cusp in\nM\u03c6 , and A(F, p) = A(F ). In this special case, the area and height of the maximal cusp are\nestimated by the stable translation distance dA (\u03c6), acting on A(F ).\nIn the special case where F is a once-punctured torus or 4\u2013punctured sphere, Futer, Kalfagianni, and Purcell proved a similar estimate, with sharper constants. See [21, Theorems 4.1\nand 4.7]. Theorem 1.5 generalizes those results to all punctured hyperbolic surfaces.\nWe note that a non-effective version of Theorem 1.5 can be derived from Minsky's a\npriori bounds theorem for the length of curves appearing in a hierarchy [29, Lemma 7.9].\nIn fact, this line of argument was our original approach to estimating cusp area. In the\nprocess of studying this problem, we came to realize that arguments using the geometry and\nhierarchical structure of the curve complex C(F ) can be replaced by elementary arguments\nfocusing on the geometry of pleated surfaces. See Section 1.5 below for an outline of this\neffective argument.\n1.3. Quasi-Fuchsian 3\u2013manifolds. The methods used to prove Theorem 1.5 also apply\nto quasi-Fuchsian manifolds. We recall the core definitions; see Marden [28, Chapter 3]\nor Thurston [36, Chapter 8] for more details. A hyperbolic manifold N = H3 /\u0393 is called\nquasi-Fuchsian if the limit set \u039b(\u0393) of \u0393 is a Jordan curve on \u2202H3 , and each component of\n\u2202H3 r\u039b(\u0393) is invariant under \u0393. In this case, N is homeomorphic to F \u00d7 R for a surface F .\nThe convex core of N , denoted core(N ), is defined to be the quotient, by \u0393, of the convex hull\nof the limit set \u039b(\u0393). When N is quasi-Fuchsian but not Fuchsian, core(N ) \u223c\n= F \u00d7 [0, 1], and\nits boundary is the disjoint union of two surfaces \u2202+ core(N ) and \u2202\u2212 core(N ), each intrinsically\nhyperbolic, and each pleated along a lamination. See Definition 2.2.\nAlthough the quasi-Fuchsian manifold N has infinite volume, the volume of core(N ) is\nfinite. Each puncture of F corresponds to a rank one maximal cusp C (the quotient of a\nhoroball by Z), such that C \u2229 core(N ) has finite volume and \u2202C \u2229 core(N ) \u223c\n= S 1 \u00d7 [0, 1]\nhas finite area. Thus we may attempt to estimate the area and height of \u2202C \u2229 core(N )\ncombinatorially.\nDefinition 1.6. Let N \u223c\n= F \u00d7 R be a quasi-Fuchsian 3\u2013manifold, and let p be a puncture\nof F . Define \u2206+ (N ) to be the collection of all shortest arcs from p to p in \u2202+ core(N ). By\nLemma 3.4, the arcs in \u2206+ (N ) are pairwise disjoint, so \u2206+ (N ) is a simplex in A(F, p).\nSimilarly, let \u2206\u2212 (N ) be the simplex of shortest arcs from p to p in \u2202\u2212 core(N ).\nWe define the arc distance of N relative to the puncture p to be\ndA (N, p) = min{dA (v, w) | v \u2208 \u2206\u2212 (N ), w \u2208 \u2206+ (N )}.\nIn words, dA (N, p) is the length of the shortest path in A(F, p) from a shortest arc in the\nlower convex core boundary to a shortest arc in the upper boundary.\n\n\fCUSP GEOMETRY OF FIBERED 3\u2013MANIFOLDS\n\n5\n\nTheorem 1.7. Let F be a surface with a preferred puncture p, and let N \u223c\n= F \u00d7 R be a\nquasi-Fuchsian 3\u2013manifold. Let C be the maximal cusp corresponding to p. Then\n1\ndA (N, p)\n\u2212\n< area(\u2202C \u2229 core(N ))\n4\n450 \u03c7(F )\n23 \u03c7(F )2\n< 9 \u03c7(F )2 dA (N, p) + 12\u03c7(F ) ln |\u03c7(F )| + 26\u03c7(F )\nSimilarly, the height of the cusp relative to a longitude satisfies\ndA (N, p)\n1\n\u2212\n< height(\u2202C \u2229 core(N )) < \u22123 \u03c7(F ) dA (N, p) + 2 ln |\u03c7(F )| + 5.\n4\n536 \u03c7(F )\n27 \u03c7(F )2\nWe note that the multiplicative constants in Theorem 1.7 are exactly the same as in\nTheorem 1.5. However, in addition to multiplicative error, the estimates in Theorem 1.7\ncontain explicit additive error. This additive error is necessary: for example, if the limit set\nof N is sufficiently close to a round circle, one may have dA (N, p) = 0. (See Lemma 9.2 for\na constructive argument.) On the other hand, area(\u2202C \u2229 core(N )) > 0 whenever N is not\nFuchsian.\nTheorem 1.7 has an interesting relation to the work of Akiyoshi, Miyachi, and Sakuma [5].\nFor a quasi-Fuchian manifold N , they study the scale-invariant quantity\nwidth(\u2202C) := height(\u2202C)/\u03bb = area(\u2202C)/\u03bb2\nwhere \u03bb is the Euclidean length of the longitude of cusp torus \u2202C. Generalizing McShane's\nidentity, they give an exact expression for width(\u2202C) as the sum of an infinite series involving\nthe complex lengths of closed curves created by joining the endpoints of an arc. It seems\nreasonable that most of the contribution in this infinite sum should come from the finitely\nmany arcs in F that are shortest in N . Theorem 1.7 matches this intuition, and indeed its\nlower bound is proved by summing the contributions of finitely many short arcs.\n1.4. Covers and the arc complex. Theorem 1.7 has an interesting application to the\ngeometry of arc complexes, whose statement does not involve 3\u2013manifolds in any way.\nDefinition 1.8. Suppose f : \u03a3 \u2192 S is an n\u2013sheeted covering map of surfaces. We define a\nrelation \u03c0 : A(S) \u2192 A(\u03a3) as follows: \u03b1 \u2208 \u03c0(a) if and only if \u03b1 is a component of f \u22121 (a). In\nother words, \u03c0(a) \u2282 A(\u03a3) is the set of all n lifts of a, which span an (n \u2212 1)\u2013simplex.\nDefinition 1.8 also applies to curve complexes, with the (inessential) difference that the\nnumber of lifts of a curve is not determined by the degree of the cover. In this context, Rafi\nand Schleimer proved that \u03c0 : C(S) \u2192 C(\u03a3) is a quasi-isometric embedding [35]. That is,\nthere exist constants K \u2265 1 and C \u2265 0, such that for all a, b \u2208 C (0) (S) and for all \u03b1 \u2208 \u03c0(a),\n\u03b2 \u2208 \u03c0(b), we have\nd(a, b) \u2264 K d(\u03b1, \u03b2) + C\n\nand d(\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2264 K d(a, b) + C.\n\nThe constants K and C depend only on S and the degree of the cover, but are not explicit.\nAs a consequence of Theorem 1.7, we prove a version of the Rafi\u2013Schleimer theorem for\narc complexes, with explicit constants.\nTheorem 1.9. Let \u03a3 and S be surfaces with one puncture, and f : \u03a3 \u2192 S a covering map\nof degree n. Let \u03c0 : A(S) \u2192 A(\u03a3) be the lifting relation. Then, for all a, b \u2208 A(0) (S), we\nhave\nd(a, b)\n\u2212 2 < d(\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2264 d(a, b)\n4050 n \u03c7(S)6\nwhere \u03b1 \u2208 \u03c0(a) and \u03b2 \u2208 \u03c0(b).\n\n\f6\n\nDAVID FUTER AND SAUL SCHLEIMER\n\n1.5. An outline of the arguments. The proofs of Theorems 1.5 and 1.7 have a decidedly\nelementary flavor. The primary tool that we use repeatedly is the geometry of pleated\nsurfaces, as developed by Thurston [36]. (See Bonahon [6] or Canary, Epstein, and Green [14]\nfor a detailed description.) In our context, a pleated surface is typically a copy of the fiber F\nwith a prescribed hyperbolic metric, immersed into M in a piecewise geodesic fashion, and\nbent along an ideal triangulation of F . In Sections 2 and 3 below, we give a detailed definition\nof pleated surfaces and discuss the geometry of cusp neighborhoods in such a surface. We\nalso study a mild generalization of pleated surfaces, called simplicial hyperbolic surfaces,\nthat are hyperbolic everywhere except for a single cone point with angle at least 2\u03c0.\nThe upper bounds of Theorems 1.5 and 1.7 are proved in Section 4 and 5, respectively. To\nsketch the argument in the fibered case, let \u03c4 be an ideal triangulation of the fiber F . Then F\ncan be homotoped to a pleated surface, F\u03c4 , in which every ideal triangle is totally geodesic.\nUsing lemmas in Sections 2 and 3, we show that the intersection F\u03c4 \u2229 \u2202C gives a closed\npolygonal curve about the puncture p, whose length is bounded by \u22126\u03c7(F ). As a result, the\npleated surface F\u03c4 makes a bounded contribution to the area and height of \u2202C. Summing up\nthe contributions from a sequence of triangulations that \"realize\" the monodromy \u03c6 gives\nthe desired upper bound of Theorem 1.5. The upper bound of Theorem 1.7 uses very similar\nideas; the one added ingredient is a bound on how far a short arc in \u2202\u00b1 core(N ) drifts when\nit is pulled tight, making it geodesic in N .\nThe lower bounds on cusp area and height rely on the idea of a geometrically controlled\nsweepout. This is a degree-one map \u03a8 : F \u00d7 [0, 1]/\u03c6 \u2192 M\u03c6 , in which every fiber F \u00d7 {t}\nin the domain is mapped to a piecewise geodesic surface Ft \u2282 M , which is either pleated\nor simplicial hyperbolic. The elementary construction of such a sweepout, which is due to\nThurston [36] and Canary [13], is recalled in Section 6.\nThe lower bound of Theorem 1.5 is proved in Section 7. We show that every piecewise\ngeodesic surface Ft in the sweepout of Section 6 must contain an an arc from cusp to cusp\nwhose length is explicitly bounded above. As the parameter t moves around the sweepout,\nwe obtain a sequence of arcs, representing a walk through the 1\u2013skeleton A(1) (F, p), such\nthat each arc encountered has bounded length in M . This sequence of somewhat-short arcs\nin the fiber leads to a packing of the cusp torus \u2202C by shadows of somewhat-large horoballs,\nimplying a lower bound on area(\u2202C) and height(\u2202C).\nIt is worth emphasizing that the entire proof of Theorem 1.5 is elementary in nature. In\nparticular, this proof does not rely on any deep results from Teichm\u00fcller theory, Kleinian\ngroups, or the coarse geometry of the curve or arc complexes.\nThe lower bound of Theorem 1.7 is proved in Section 8, using very similar ideas to those\nof Theorem 1.5. Once again, we have a sweepout \u03a8 : F \u00d7 [0, r] \u2192 core(N ) by simplicial\nhyperbolic surfaces. Once again, each surface Ft in the sweepout contains a somewhat-short\narc from cusp to cusp, corresponding to a horoball whose shadow contributes area to \u2202C.\nHowever, we also need to know that the pleated surfaces at the start and end of the sweepout\ncan be chosen arbitrarily close to \u2202\u00b1 core(N ). This fact, written down as Theorem A.1 in\nthe appendix, is the one place in the paper where we need to reach into the non-elementary\ntoolbox of Kleinian groups.\nFinally, in Section 9, we prove Theorem 1.9. Given a cover \u03a3 \u2192 S, vertices a, b of A(S),\nand vertices \u03b1 \u2208 \u03c0(a), \u03b2 \u2208 \u03c0(b), the upper bound on the distance d(\u03b1, \u03b2) is immediate\nbecause disjoint arcs lift to disjoint multi-arcs. To prove a lower bound, we construct a\nquasi-Fuchsian manifold M \u223c\n= S \u00d7 R, so that a and b are the unique shortest arcs on its\nconvex core boundaries. The hyperbolic metric on M \u223c\n= S \u00d7 R lifts to a quasi-Fuchsian\n\n\fCUSP GEOMETRY OF FIBERED 3\u2013MANIFOLDS\n\n7\n\nstructure on N \u223c\n= \u03a3 \u00d7 R. By applying Theorem 1.7 to both M and N , we will bound d(\u03b1, \u03b2)\nfrom below.\n1.6. Acknowledgments.

Pleated surfaces and cusps\nTo prove the upper and lower bounds in our main theorems, we need a detailed understanding of the geometry of pleated surfaces in a hyperbolic 3\u2013manifold. In this section,\nwe survey several known results about pleated surfaces. We also describe the somewhat\nsubtle geometry of the intersection between a pleated surface and a cusp neighborhood in\na 3\u2013manifold N . The study of pleated surfaces is continued in Section 3, where we obtain\nseveral geometric estimates.\nReferences for this material include Bonahon [6] and Canary, Epstein, and Green [14].\nDefinition 2.1. Let S be a surface, as in Definition 1.2. A lamination L \u2282 S is a 1\u2013\ndimensional foliation of a closed subset of S.\nA special case of a lamination is the union of the edges of an ideal triangulation; this\nspecial case appears frequently in our setting.\nDefinition 2.2. Let N be a hyperbolic 3\u2013manifold, and let S be a surface. Fix a proper\nmap f0 : S \u2192 N , sending punctures to cusps. For a lamination L \u2282 S a pleating of f0 along\nL, or a pleating map for short, is a map f : S \u2192 N , properly homotopic to f0 , such that\n(1) f maps every leaf of L to a hyperbolic geodesic, and\n(2) f maps every component of SrL to a totally geodesic surface in N .\nWe say that f realizes the lamination L, and call its image f (S) a pleated surface.\nNote the existence of a pleating map places restrictions on L; for instance, every closed\nleaf of L must be essential and non-peripheral in S. The hyperbolic metric on N , viewed as\na path-metric, pulls back via f to induce a complete hyperbolic metric on S. In this induced\nhyperbolic metric, every leaf of L becomes a geodesic, and the map f : S \u2192 N becomes a\npiecewise isometry, which is bent along the geodesic leaves of f (L).\nLemma 2.3. Every pleated surface f (S) is contained in the convex core of N .\nProof. Adding leaves as needed to subdivide the totally geodesic regions, we can arrange for\nthe complement SrL to consist of ideal triangles. Fix g, a side of some ideal triangle of\nSrL. Thus g is a bi-infinite geodesic; each end of the image geodesic f (g) either runs out\na cusp of N or meets a small metric ball infinitely many times. In either case, the lift of\ne = H3 has both endpoints at limit points of N . Since an ideal\nf (g) to the universal cover N\n3\ntriangle in H is the convex hull of its vertices, the surface f (S) is contained in core(N ). \u0003\nIn a quasi-Fuchsian manifold N , the components of \u2202\u00b1 core(N ) are themselves pleated\nsurfaces. In this paper, the convex core boundaries are the only examples of pleated surfaces\nwhere the pleating laminations are not ideal triangulations.\n\n\f8\n\nDAVID FUTER AND SAUL SCHLEIMER\n\nSe\n\n\u03b30\nH0\nd\n\n\u03b3\n\nH\n\nFigure 1. The intersection between a pleated surface and a horocusp. The\nintersection with horoball H0 is standard, whereas the intersection with H\nmay contain portions of the surface bent along geodesics whose endpoints are\nnot in H. Graphic based on a design of Agol [3, Figure 1].\nA foundational result is that every essential surface S \u2282 N can be pleated along an\narbitrary ideal triangulation. This was first observed by Thurston [36, Chapter 8]. For a\nmore detailed account of the proof, see Canary, Epstein, and Green [14, Theorem 5.3.6] or\nLackenby [27, Lemma 2.2].\nProposition 2.4. Let N be a cusped orientable hyperbolic 3\u2013manifold. Let f0 : S \u2192 N be a\nproper, essential map, sending punctures to cusps. Then, for any ideal triangulation \u03c4 of S,\nthe map f0 is homotopic to a pleating map along \u03c4 .\nIn other words, every ideal triangulation \u03c4 is realized by a pleating map f\u03c4 : S \u2192 N . \u0003\nSuppose that C \u2282 N is a horospherical cusp neighborhood in N , and f : S \u2192 N is a\npleating map. Our goal is to describe the geometry of f (S) \u2229 C. We offer Figure 1 as a\npreview of the geometric picture. The figure depicts a lift Se of a pleated surface to H3 . For a\nsufficiently small horocusp C0 \u2282 C, which lifts to horoball H0 in the figure, the intersection\nf (S) \u2229 C0 is standard, meaning that f \u22121 (C0 ) is a union of horospherical cusp neighborhoods\nin S. The intersection f (S) \u2229 C is more complicated, because the surface is bent along\ncertain geodesics whose interior intersects CrC0 . Nevertheless, we can use the geometry\nof f (S) \u2229 C0 to find certain cusp neighborhoods contained in f \u22121 (C) (in Lemma 2.5), and\ncertain geometrically meaningful closed curves in \u2202C (in Lemma 2.6).\nLemma 2.5. Let N be a cusped orientable hyperbolic 3\u2013manifold, with a horocusp C. Let\nf : S \u2192 N be a pleating map, such that n punctures of S are mapped to C. Suppose that\na loop about a puncture of S is represented by a geodesic of length \u03bb on \u2202C. Then, in\nthe induced hyperbolic metric on S, the preimage f \u22121 (C) \u2282 S contains horospherical cusp\nneighborhoods R1 , . . . , Rn with disjoint interiors, such that\n`(\u2202Ri ) = area(Ri ) \u2265 \u03bb\n\nfor each i.\n\nOur proof is inspired by an argument of Agol [3, Theorem 5.1].\nProof of Lemma 2.5. Without loss of generality, assume that the pleating lamination L cuts\nS into ideal triangles. (Otherwise, add more leaves to L.) Let C0 \u2282 C be a horocusp\n\n\fCUSP GEOMETRY OF FIBERED 3\u2013MANIFOLDS\n\n9\n\nchosen sufficiently small so that C0 \u2229 f (L) is a union of non-compact rays into the cusp.\nThen f \u22121 (C0 ) is a union of tips of ideal triangles in S and consists of disjoint horospherical\nneighborhoods R10 , . . . , Rn0 , each mapped into C.\nLift N to its universal cover H3 , so that C0 lifts to a horoball H0 about \u221e in the upper\nhalf-space model. Then f]\n(S) intersects H0 in vertical bands, as shown in Figure 1.\nLet d be the distance in N between \u2202C0 and \u2202C. Since the interior of C is embedded,\nthis means that the shortest geodesic in N from C0 to C0 has length at least 2d. Since the\npleating map f : S \u2192 N is distance-decreasing, the shortest geodesic in S from f \u22121 (C0 ) to\nitself also has length at least 2d. In other words, we may take a closed d\u2013neighborhood of\neach Ri0 and obtain a cusp neighborhood Ri , such that R1 , . . . , Rn have disjoint interiors.\nConsider the areas of these neighborhoods, along with their boundary lengths. A standard\ncalculation in the upper half-plane model of H2 implies that the length of a horocycle in S\nequals the area of the associated cusp neighborhood. Furthermore, both quantities grow\nexponentially with d.\nOn \u2202C0 , a Euclidean geodesic about a puncture of S has length e\u2212d \u03bb. Since f (S) \u2229 C0\nmay not be totally geodesic (in general, it is bent, as in Figure 1), each curve of \u2202Ri0 has\nlength bounded below by e\u2212d \u03bb. These lengths grow by ed as we take a d\u2013neighborhood of\n\u222ai Ri0 . We conclude that each component Ri satisfies\n(2.1)\n\n`(\u2202Ri ) = area(Ri ) \u2265 ed * e\u2212d * \u03bb = \u03bb.\n\nIt remains to show that f (Ri ) \u2282 C for each i. Suppose, without loss of generality, that R10\nis the component of f \u22121 (C0 ) whose lift is mapped to the horoball H0 . Then, by construction,\nthe lift of R1 is mapped into the d\u2013neighborhood of H0 , which is a horoball H covering C.\nThus f (R1 ) \u2282 C. Note that the containment might be strict, because f (S) might be bent\nalong some geodesics in the region CrC0 , as in the middle of Figure 1.\n\u0003\nThe argument of Lemma 2.5 also permits the following construction, which is also important for Section 4.\nLemma 2.6. Let N be a cusped orientable hyperbolic 3\u2013manifold, with a horocusp C. Let\nf : S \u2192 N be a pleating map that realizes an ideal triangulation \u03c4 . Then, for each puncture\np of S that is mapped to C, there is an immersed closed curve \u03b3 = \u03b3(f, p, C), piecewise\ngeodesic in the Euclidean metric on \u2202C, with the following properties:\n(1) The loop \u03b3 is homotopic in C to a loop in f (S) about p.\n(2) The vertices of \u03b3 lie in \u2202C \u2229 f (\u03c4 ), and correspond to the endpoints of edges of \u03c4 at\npuncture p.\n(3) `(\u03b3) = `(\u2202Ri ), where Ri \u2282 S is one of the cusp neighborhoods of Lemma 2.5.\nA lift of \u03b3 to a horoball H covering C is shown, dotted, in Figure 1.\nProof of Lemma 2.6. We may construct \u03b3 as follows. Recall, from the proof of Lemma 2.5,\nthat there is a horocusp C0 \u2282 C such that the intersection f (S)\u2229C0 is standard, consisting of\ntips of ideal triangles. Then f \u22121 (C0 ) is a disjoint union of horospherical cusp neighborhoods.\nLet Ri0 be the component of f \u22121 (C0 ) that contains puncture p, and let \u03b30 = f (\u2202Ri0 ) \u2282 \u2202C0 .\nNote that the curve \u03b30 is piecewise geodesic in the Euclidean metric on \u2202C0 , and that it\nis bent precisely at the intersection points \u2202C0 \u2229 f (\u03c4 ), where the triangulation \u03c4 enters the\ncusp. See Figure 1.\nWe define \u03b3 to be the projection of \u03b30 to the horospherical torus \u2202C. Note that if C0\nand C are lifted to horoballs about \u221e in H3 , as in Figure 1, this projection is just vertical\nprojection in the upper half-space model.\n\n\f10\n\nDAVID FUTER AND SAUL SCHLEIMER\n\nObserve that while \u03b30 \u2282 f (S), its projection \u03b3 might not be contained in the pleated\nsurface. Nevertheless, \u03b3 is completely defined by \u03b30 . The vertices where \u03b3 is bent are\ncontained in f (\u03c4 ).\nLet d be the distance between \u2202C0 and \u2202C. Then, as in Lemma 2.5, lengths grow by a\nfactor of ed as we pass from \u2202C0 to \u2202C. Thus, by the same calculation as in (2.1),\n`(\u03b3) = ed * `(\u03b30 ) = ed * area(Ri0 ) = area(Ri ) = `(\u2202Ri ),\nwhere Ri \u2283 Ri0 is the cusp neighborhood in S that is mapped into C, as in Lemma 2.5.\n\n\u0003\n\nOur final goal in this section is to provide a universal lower bound on the size of the cusp\nneighborhoods Ri . We do this using the following result of Adams [1].\nLemma 2.7. Let N be a non-elementary, orientable hyperbolic 3\u2013manifold, and let C be a\nmaximal horocusp in N . (This neighborhood may correspond to either a rank one or rank\ntwo cusp.) Let s be a simple closed curve on \u2202C, which forms part of the boundary of an\nessential surface in N . Then `(s) > 21/4 .\nProof. This is a consequence of a theorem of Adams [1, Theorem 3.3]. He proved that every\nparabolic translation of the maximal cusp of any non-elementary hyperbolic 3\u2013manifold has\nlength greater than 21/4 , with exactly three exceptions: one parabolic each in the three\nSnapPea census manifolds m004, m009, and m015.\nEach of the manifolds m004, m009, and m015 is either a punctured torus bundle or a twobridge knot complement. Hence the boundary slopes of incompressible surfaces in these\nmanifolds are classified [19, 25]. In particular, none of the three slopes shorter than 21/4\nbounds an essential surface.\n\u0003\nAs a result, we obtain\nLemma 2.8. Let N be a cusped orientable hyperbolic 3\u2013manifold, with a maximal cusp C.\nLet f (S) \u2282 N be a pleated surface, homotopic to a properly embedded essential surface, such\nthat n punctures of S are mapped to C. Then f \u22121 (C) \u2282 S contains n disjoint horospherical\ncusp neighborhoods R1 , . . . , Rn , such that\n`(\u2202Ri ) = area(Ri ) > 21/4\n\nfor each i.\n\nProof. This is immediate from Lemmas 2.5 and 2.7.\n\n\u0003\n\n3. Hyperbolic surfaces with one cone point\nRecall from Definition 2.2 that every pleated surface carries an intrinsic hyperbolic metric.\nIn this section, we prove several lemmas about the geometry of cusp neighborhoods and geodesic arcs in these surfaces. These estimates are used throughout the proofs of Theorems 1.5\nand 1.7.\nIn fact, we work in a slightly more general setting: namely, hyperbolic surfaces with a\ncone point, whose cone angle is at least 2\u03c0. These singular surfaces arise in sweepouts of\na hyperbolic 3\u2013manifold: see Section 6. Therefore, we derive length and area estimates for\nthese singular surfaces, as well as non-singular ones.\nDefinition 3.1. A hyperbolic cone surface is a complete metric space S, homeomorphic to a\nsurface of finite type. We require that S admits a triangulation into finitely many simplices,\nsuch that each simplex is isometric to a totally geodesic triangle in H2 . The triangles are\nallowed to have any combination of ideal vertices (which correspond to punctures of S) and\n\n\fCUSP GEOMETRY OF FIBERED 3\u2013MANIFOLDS\n\n11\n\nmaterial vertices (which correspond to points in S). The triangles are glued by isometries\nalong their edges.\nEvery point of S that is not a material vertex of the triangulation thus has a neighborhood\nisometric to a disk in H2 . Every material vertex v \u2208 S has a neighborhood where where the\nmetric (in polar coordinates) takes the form\n(3.1)\n\nds2 = dr2 + sinh2 (r) d\u03b82 ,\n\nwhere 0 \u2264 r < rv and 0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 \u03b8v . Here \u03b8v is called the cone angle at v, and can be computed\nas the sum of the interior angles at v over all the triangles that meet v. Note that if \u03b8v = 2\u03c0,\nequation (3.1) becomes the standard polar equation for the hyperbolic metric in a disk. The\nvertices of S whose cone angles are not equal to 2\u03c0 are called the cone points or singular\npoints of S; all remaining points are called non-singular.\nIf all singular points of S have cone angles \u03b8v > 2\u03c0, another common name for S is a\nsimplicial hyperbolic surface. Simplicial hyperbolic surfaces have played an important role\nin the study of geometrically infinite Kleinian groups [13, 22].\nJust as with non-singular hyperbolic surfaces, cone surfaces have a natural geometric\nnotion of a cusp neighborhood.\nDefinition 3.2. Let S be a hyperbolic cone surface, with one or more punctures, and let\nR \u2282 S be a closed set. Then R is called an equidistant cusp neighborhood of a puncture of\nS if the following conditions are satisfied:\n(1) The interior of R is homeomorphic to S 1 \u00d7 (0, \u221e).\ne is isometric to a horoball\n(2) There is a closed subset Q \u2282 R, whose universal cover Q\n2\nin H . This implies that the interior of Q is disjoint from all cone points.\n(3) There is a distance d > 0, such that R is the closed d\u2013neighborhood of Q.\nR is called a maximal cusp if it is not a proper subset of any larger equidistant cusp neighborhood. Equivalently, R is maximal if and only if it is not homeomorphic to S 1 \u00d7 [0, \u221e).\nLemma 3.3. Let S be a hyperbolic surface with one cone point v, of angle \u03b8v \u2265 2\u03c0. Let\nR \u2282 S be a non-maximal equidistant neighborhood of a puncture of S. Then\n(1) There is a geodesic \u03b1 that is shortest among all essential paths from R to R.\n(2) The arc \u03b1 is either embedded, or is the union of a segment and a loop based at v. In\nthe latter case, there is an arbitrarily small homotopy in S making \u03b1 embedded.\n(3) If 2\u03c0 \u2264 \u03b8v < 4\u03c0, and \u03b2 is another shortest arc from R to R, there is an arbitrarily\nsmall homotopy making \u03b1 and \u03b2 disjoint.\nOne way to interpret Lemma 3.3 is as follows. Let p be a puncture of S. Then any shortest\narc relative to a cusp neighborhood about p gives a vertex of the arc complex A(S, p). If\nthere are two distinct shortest arcs, they span an edge of A(S, p); more generally, if there\nare n distinct shortest arcs, they span an (n \u2212 1)\u2013simplex. This is used in Sections 7 and 8\nto construct a path in A(S, p).\nProof of Lemma 3.3. Let d be the infimal distance in the universal cover Se between two\ndifferent lifts of \u2202R; since R is not a maximal cusp, d > 0. Furthermore, since distance to\ne it achieves a minimum. Thus there are\nthe nearest translate is an equivariant function on \u2202 R,\npoints x, y on distinct lifts of \u2202R, whose distance is exactly d. By the Hopf\u2013Rinow theorem\nfor cone manifolds [16, Lemma 3.7], the distance between x and y is realized by a geodesic\npath \u03b1, and every distance-realizing path is a geodesic. This proves (1).\n\n\f12\n\nDAVID FUTER AND SAUL SCHLEIMER\n\nSuppose that \u03b1 : [0, d] \u2192 S is a unit-speed parametrization. The image of \u03b1 is a graph\n\u0393 = Im(\u03b1). If \u03b1 is not embedded, then \u0393 has at least one vertex of valence larger than 2. In\nthis case, we will show that \u0393 is the union of a segment and a loop based at v.\nLet w be a vertex of \u0393 that has valence larger than 2. Consider preimages x, y \u2208 \u03b1\u22121 (w),\nwhere x < y. Then [0, d] splits into sub-intervals\nI1 = [0, x],\n\nI2 = [x, y],\n\nI3 = [y, d].\n\nLet \u03b1i be the restriction of \u03b1 to the sub-interval Ii .\nWe claim that \u03b11 must be homotopic to \u03b13 (the reverse of \u03b13 ): otherwise, cutting out the\nmiddle segment \u03b12 would produce a shorter essential path. We also claim that `(\u03b11 ) = `(\u03b13 ):\nfor, if `(\u03b11 ) < `(\u03b13 ), we could homotope \u03b13 to \u03b11 while shortening the length of \u03b1. In\nparticular, the last claim implies that x and y are the only preimages of w, and w has\nvalence 3 or 4.\nIf w 6= v, then it is a non-singular point of S, hence a 4\u2013valent vertex. This means that \u03b11\nmeets \u03b13 at a nonzero angle. Then, exchanging \u03b11 and \u03b13 by homotopy and rounding off the\ncorner at w, as in Figure 2, produces an essential arc shorter than \u03b1. This is a contradiction.\n\u03b12\n\n\u03b13\n\u21d2\n\u03b11\n\nFigure 2. Exchanging and rounding off the arcs \u03b11 and \u03b13 produces a shorter path.\nWe may now assume that the only vertex in the interior of \u0393 = Im(\u03b1) occurs at the cone\npoint v. This implies that v is not in the cusp neighborhood R, hence R contains no singular\ne is isometric to a horoball. Thus, since horoballs are convex,\npoints and its universal cover R\nthere is a unique shortest path from v to R, in each homotopy class.\nIn particular, the homotopic arcs \u03b11 and \u03b13 must coincide. Thus w = v is 3\u2013valent,\nand is the only vertex of \u0393. Hence \u03b12 is an embedded loop based at v, and \u03b1 must be\nan \"eyeglass\" that follows \u03b11 from R to v, runs around the loop \u03b12 , and returns to R by\nretracing \u03b11 . In this case, even though \u03b1 is not embedded, one component of the frontier of\nan \u03b5\u2013neighborhood of \u0393 is an embedded arc homotopic to \u03b1. This proves (2).\nFor future reference, we note an important feature of eyeglass geodesics. Suppose that \u03b1\nconsists of an arc \u03b11 from v to R and a loop \u03b12 based at v. Then \u03b11 must be the unique\nshortest path from v to R. For if another geodesic \u03b13 from v to R has length `(\u03b13 ) \u2264 `(\u03b11 ),\nthen \u03b11 and \u03b13 must be in different homotopy classes. This means \u03b11 \u222a \u03b13 is an essential\narc from R to R, whose length is\n`(\u03b11 ) + `(\u03b13 ) \u2264 2`(\u03b11 ) < 2`(\u03b11 ) + `(\u03b12 ) = `(a),\ncontradicting the fact that \u03b1 is shortest.\nFor part (3), suppose that \u03b1 and \u03b2 are two distinct shortest arcs from R to R. By\nstatement (2), each of \u03b1 and \u03b2 is either an embedded arc or an eyeglass with a loop based\nat v. Suppose that \u03b1 and \u03b2 intersect, and let \u0393 = Im(\u03b1) \u222a Im(\u03b2).\nIf \u0393 has a non-singular vertex w, then w cuts \u03b1 into sub-arcs \u03b11 , \u03b12 that run from w to R.\nSimilarly, w cuts \u03b2 into sub-arcs \u03b23 , \u03b24 from w to R. Without loss of generality, say that \u03b11\nis shortest among these four arcs. Then at least one of \u03b11 \u222a \u03b21 or \u03b11 \u222a \u03b22 is an essential arc\nfrom R to R, and both of these arcs are no longer than \u03b2. By rounding off the corner at w,\nwe can make \u03b11 \u222a \u03b21 or \u03b11 \u222a \u03b22 into an essential arc shorter than \u03b2. This is a contradiction.\n\n\fCUSP GEOMETRY OF FIBERED 3\u2013MANIFOLDS\n\n\u03b2\n\n13\n\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\n\u21d2\n\u2265\u03c0\n\n\u03b2\n\u21d2\n\n\u2265\u03c0\n\n\u2265\u03c0\n\n\u2265\u03c0\n\nFigure 3.

Two eyeglass paths that share the same stem can be made disjointly embedded after a short homotopy. Shown are the embedded versions\nof \u03b1 and \u03b2, in the three possible interleaving configurations at vertex v.\nFor the rest of the proof, we assume that the only vertex of \u0393 is at v. One consequence of\nthis assumption is that R contains no singular points. Hence, as in the proof of (2), there\nis a unique shortest path from v to R in each homotopy class. There are three cases: (i)\nneither \u03b1 nor \u03b2 is an eyeglass, (ii), \u03b1 is an eyeglass but \u03b2 is not, and (iii) both \u03b1 and \u03b2 are\neyeglasses.\nIf \u03b1 and \u03b2 are embedded arcs that intersect at v, consider the valence of v, which must\nbe 3 or 4. If v is 3\u2013valent, \u03b1 and \u03b2 must share the same path \u03b11 = \u03b21 from R to v, then\ndiverge. In this case, the \u03b5\u2013neighborhood of \u0393 contains disjointly embedded arcs homotopic\nto \u03b1 and \u03b2.\nIf v is 4\u2013valent, let \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b34 be the four geodesic sub-arcs of \u0393 from v to R. Since each\n\u03b3i is the unique shortest path in its homotopy class, any combination \u03b3i \u222a \u03b3j is an essential\narc. Since \u03b1 = \u03b31 \u222a \u03b32 and \u03b2 = \u03b33 \u222a \u03b34 are both shortest arcs in S, every \u03b3i must have the\nsame length. But since v has cone angle \u03b8v < 4\u03c0, there must be two sub-arcs \u03b3i , \u03b3j that\nmeet at an angle less than \u03c0. Thus \u03b3i \u222a \u03b3j can be shortened by smoothing the corner at v,\ncontradicting the assumption that \u03b1 and \u03b2 are shortest.\nIf \u03b1 is an eyeglass, but \u03b2 is not, let \u03b11 be the sub-arc of \u03b1 from v to R. By the observation\nat the end of part (2), \u03b11 is the unique shortest geodesic from v to R. Let \u03b21 , \u03b22 be the\nsub-arcs of \u03b2 from v to R, where `(\u03b21 ) \u2264 `(\u03b22 ). If \u03b11 is distinct from \u03b21 , then \u03b11 \u222a \u03b21 would\nbe an essential path that is shorter than \u03b2 - contradiction. Thus \u03b11 = \u03b21 . In this case,\nhomotoping \u03b1 to an embedded arc makes it disjoint from \u03b2. See Figure 3.\nFinally, if each of \u03b1 and \u03b2 is an eyeglass, the observation at the end of part (2) implies\nthat each of \u03b1 and \u03b2 must contain the unique shortest geodesic from v to R. Thus each of \u03b1\n\n\f14\n\nDAVID FUTER AND SAUL SCHLEIMER\n\nand \u03b2 consists of the same geodesic arc \u03b31 from v to R, as well as a loop based at v. Figure 4\nshows that the \u03b5\u2013neighborhood of \u0393 = Im(\u03b1) \u222a Im(\u03b2) contains disjointly embedded paths\nrepresenting \u03b1 and \u03b2.\n\u0003\nIn the case where S is a non-singular surface, we have a stronger version of Lemma 3.3:\nnot only are shortest arcs disjoint, but nearly-shortest arcs must be disjoint as well.\nLemma 3.4. Let S be a punctured hyperbolic surface, and let R be a horospherical neighborhood about one puncture. Let \u03b1 and \u03b2 be distinct geodesic arcs from R to R. If \u03b1 and \u03b2\nintersect, then there is a third geodesic arc \u03b3, satisfying\n`(\u03b3) \u2264 max{`(\u03b1), `(\u03b2)} \u2212 ln(2).\nHere, all lengths are measured relative to the cusp neighborhood R.\nIn practice, we use the contrapositive statement: if both \u03b1 and \u03b2 are at most ln(2) longer\nthan the shortest geodesic from R to R, then they must be disjoint.\nProof of Lemma 3.4. If we change the size of the cusp neighborhood R, then all geodesic\narcs from R to R have their lengths changed by the same additive constant. Thus, without\nloss of generality, we may assume that R is small enough so that all intersections between \u03b1\nand \u03b2 happen outside R. As S has no cone points, \u03b1 and \u03b2 meet transversely.\nOrient both \u03b1 and \u03b2. If we cut the geodesic \u03b1 along its intersection points with \u03b2, we obtain\na collection of segments. Let \u03b11 and \u03b12 be the first and last such segments, respectively,\nalong an orientation of \u03b1. That is, \u03b11 (respectively \u03b12 ) is the sub-arc of \u03b1 from \u2202R to the\nfirst (last) point of intersection with \u03b2. Similarly, let \u03b21 and \u03b22 be the first and last segments\nof \u03b2, along an orientation of \u03b2.\nAssume, without loss of generality, that \u03b11 is shortest among the segments \u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b21 , \u03b22 .\nSet v = \u03b11 \u2229 \u03b2. Then the vertex v cuts \u03b2 into sub-arcs \u03b23 and \u03b24 , such that \u03b21 \u2282 \u03b23 and\n\u03b22 \u2282 \u03b24 . Without loss of generality, we may also assume that \u03b23 (rather than \u03b24 ) is the\nsub-arc of \u03b2 that meets \u03b11 at an angle of at most \u03c0/2.\nNote that \u03b11 \u222a \u03b23 is an embedded arc, because (by construction) \u03b11 only intersects \u03b2 at\nthe vertex v. Furthermore, \u03b11 \u222a \u03b23 is topologically essential (otherwise, one could homotope\n\u03b2 to reduce its length). The hypothesis that \u03b11 is shortest among \u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b21 , \u03b22 implies that\n`(\u03b11 \u222a \u03b23 ) \u2264 `(\u03b22 \u222a \u03b23 ) \u2264 `(\u03b24 \u222a \u03b23 ) = `(\u03b2).\nLet \u03b3 denote the geodesic from R to R in the homotopy class of \u03b11 \u222a\u03b23 . Then the geodesic\nextensions of \u03b11 , \u03b23 , and \u03b3 form a 2/3 ideal triangle, with angle \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0/2 at the material\nvertex v. Then, [15, Lemma A.3] gives\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03b8\n\u2264 `(\u03b2) + ln 12 ,\n`(\u03b3) = `(\u03b11 \u222a \u03b23 ) + ln 1\u2212cos\n2\nas desired.\n\n\u0003\n\nNext, we consider the area of equidistant cusp neighborhoods in S.\nLemma 3.5. Let S be a simplicial hyperbolic surface with at most one singular point. Let\nR1 and R2 be embedded equidistant neighborhoods of the same puncture of S, such that\nR1 \u2282 R2 \u2282 S, and d is the distance between \u2202R1 and \u2202R2 . Then\narea(R2 ) \u2265 ed area(R1 ).\nProof. Let Q \u2282 R1 be a cusp neighborhood isometric to the quotient of a horoball. Then\nthere is a number m > 0, such that for all x \u2208 [0, m], the closed x\u2013neighborhood of Q is\n\n\fCUSP GEOMETRY OF FIBERED 3\u2013MANIFOLDS\n\n15\n\nan equidistant cusp neighborhood R(x). In particular, R1 = R(x1 ) and R2 = R(x2 ), where\nx2 = x1 + d. We shall explore the dependence of area(R(x)) on the parameter x.\nLet v be the singular point of S. (If S is non-singular, let v be an arbitrary point of\nSrQ, and consider it a cone point of cone angle 2\u03c0.) Let xv be the distance from v to \u2202Q.\nThen, for x < xv , R(x) is a non-singular neighborhood of a cusp, itself the quotient of a\nhoroball. As mentioned in the proof of Lemma 2.5, the area of a horospherical cusp grows\nexponentially with distance. In symbols,\narea(R(x)) = ex area(Q)\n\nif x \u2264 xv .\n\nFor x > xv , the cusp neighborhood R(x) can be constructed from a horoball and a cone.\nMore precisely: take a horospherical cusp, and cut it along a vertical slit of length r = x\u2212xv .\nThen, take a cone of radius r and angle \u03b8 = \u03b8v \u2212 2\u03c0, and cut it open along a radius. Gluing\nthese pieces together along the slits produces R(x). The area of a hyperbolic cone with radius\nr and angle \u03b8 can be computed as 2\u03b8 sinh2 (r/2). Adding this to the area of a horospherical\ncusp, we obtain\n\u001a x\ne area(Q)\nif x < xv ,\narea(R(x)) =\n2\nx\ne area(Q) + 2\u03b8 sinh ((x \u2212 xv )/2) if x \u2265 xv .\nTo complete the proof, it suffices to check that the function f (x) = sinh2 (x/2) grows\nsuper-exponentially for x \u2265 0:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nx+d 2\nx\nd\nx\nd 2\nsinh\n=\nsinh cosh + cosh sinh\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\nx\nd\nx\nd 2\n>\nsinh cosh + sinh sinh\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u0010\n\u0011\n2\nx\n=\ned/2 sinh\n\u0010 x2\u0011\n.\n= ed sinh2\n2\nThus, since the area of R(x) is the sum of two functions, each of which grows at least\nexponentially with x, it follows that area(R(x + d)) \u2265 ed area(R(x)).\n\u0003\nLemma 3.6. Let S be a simplicial hyperbolic surface with at most one singular point. Let\nRmax \u2282 S be a maximal cusp neighborhood of a puncture of S. Then\narea(Rmax ) \u2264 \u22122\u03c0\u03c7(S).\nFurthermore, if S is non-singular, then\narea(Rmax ) \u2264 \u22126\u03c7(S).\nProof. Let \u03b8v \u2265 2\u03c0 be the cone angle at the singular point. (As above, we take \u03b8v = 2\u03c0 if\nthe surface S is non-singular.) Then, by the Gauss\u2013Bonnet theorem [16, Theorem 3.15],\n(3.2)\n\narea(Rmax ) \u2264 area(S) = \u22122\u03c0\u03c7(S) + [2\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8v ] \u2264 \u22122\u03c0\u03c7(S).\n\nIf S is a non-singular surface, then horosphere packing estimates of B\u00f6r\u00f6czky [7] imply\nthat at most 3/\u03c0 of the area of S can be contained in the cusp neighborhood Rmax . Thus\nthe above estimate improves to area(Rmax ) \u2264 \u22126\u03c7(S).\n\u0003\nRemark 3.7. By the Gauss\u2013Bonnet theorem expressed in equation (3.2), the area of S\ndecreases as the cone angle \u03b8v increases from 2\u03c0. Thus it seems reasonable that the area of\na maximal cusp Rmax would also decrease as \u03b8v increases from 2\u03c0. If this conjecture is true,\n\n\f16\n\nDAVID FUTER AND SAUL SCHLEIMER\n\nthen the estimate area(Rmax ) \u2264 \u22126\u03c7(S) would hold for singular hyperbolic surfaces as well\nas non-singular ones.\nLemma 3.8. Let S be a simplicial hyperbolic surface with at most one singular point. Let\nR \u2282 S be an embedded equidistant neighborhood of a puncture of S. Then there exists a\ngeodesic arc \u03b1 from R to R, satisfying\n`(\u03b1) \u2264 2 ln |2\u03c0 \u03c7(S)/area(R)|.\nFurthermore, if S is non-singular, then\n`(\u03b1) \u2264 2 ln |6 \u03c7(S)/area(R)|.\nProof. By Lemma 3.3, there is a geodesic arc \u03b1 that is shortest among all essential arcs from\nR to R. Let Rmax be the maximal cusp neighborhood containing R. Then, by construction,\nRmax meets itself at the midpoint of \u03b1. Thus the distance from \u2202R to \u2202Rmax is d = `(\u03b1)/2.\nBy Lemma 3.5, this implies\ned area(R) \u2264 area(Rmax ),\nwhich simplifies to\n`(\u03b1) = 2d \u2264 2 ln (area(Rmax )/area(R)) .\nSubstituting the bound on area(Rmax ) from Lemma 3.6 completes the proof.\n\u0003\n4. Upper bound: fibered manifolds\nIn this section, we prove the upper bounds of Theorem 1.5. We begin with a slightly\nsimpler statement:\nTheorem 4.1. Let F be an orientable hyperbolic surface with a preferred puncture p, and let\n\u03c8 : F \u2192 F be an orientation-preserving, pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism such that \u03c8(p) = p.\nIn the mapping torus M\u03c8 , let C be the maximal cusp that corresponds to p. Then\narea(\u2202C) \u2264 9 \u03c7(F )2 dA (\u03c8)\n\nand\n\nheight(\u2202C) < \u22123 \u03c7(F ) dA (\u03c8).\n\nTheorem 4.1 differs from the upper bound of Theorem 1.5 in two relatively small ways.\nFirst, Theorem 4.1 restricts attention to monodromies that fix the puncture p. (Given an\narbitrary pseudo-Anosov \u03c6, one can let \u03c8 be the smallest power of \u03c6 such that \u03c8(p) = p.)\nSecond, Theorem 4.1 estimates cusp area and height in terms of the translation distance\ndA (\u03c8), rather than the stable translation distance dA (\u03c8). We shall see at the end of the\nsection that this simpler statement quickly implies the upper bound of Theorem 1.5.\nProof of Theorem 4.1. The proof involves a direct construction. Suppose that dA (\u03c8) = k.\nThen, by Definition 1.3, there is a vertex a0 \u2208 A(0) (F, p), that is an isotopy class of arc in\nF meeting the puncture p, so that dA (a0 , \u03c8(a0 )) = k. Fix a geodesic segment in A(1) (F, p)\nwith vertices\na0 , a1 , . . . , ak = \u03c8(a0 ).\nBy Definition 1.2, the arcs representing ai\u22121 and ai are disjoint. Thus, for every i = 1, . . . , k,\nwe can choose an ideal triangulation \u03c4i of F that contains ai\u22121 and ai . In the arc complex\nA(F, p), the geodesic segment from a0 to ak extends to a bi-infinite, \u03c8\u2013invariant, piecewise\ngeodesic. Similarly, the sequence of ideal triangulations \u03c41 , . . . , \u03c4k extends to a bi-infinite\nsequence of triangulations in which \u03c4i+k = \u03c8(\u03c4i ).\nTo prove the upper bounds on cusp area and height, it is convenient to work with the\ninfinite cyclic cover of M\u03c8 . This is a hyperbolic manifold N\u03c8 \u223c\n= F \u00d7 R, in which the torus\n\n\fCUSP GEOMETRY OF FIBERED 3\u2013MANIFOLDS\n\na4\na2\n\n17\n\nA\n\na3\na1\n\nFigure 5. The edges ai enter the cusp annulus A \u2282 N\u03c8 at well-defined heights.\ncusps of M lift to annular, rank one cusps. Let A \u2282 N\u03c8 be the lift of \u2202C that corresponds\nto the puncture p of F .\nWe choose geodesic coordinates for the Euclidean metric on A \u223c\n= S 1 \u00d7 R, in which the\nnon-trivial circle (a longitude about p) is horizontal, and the R direction is vertical. We\nalso choose an orientation for every arc ai , such that the oriented edge ai points into the\npreferred puncture p. In the 3\u2013manifold N\u03c8 , the edge ai is homotopic to a unique oriented\ngeodesic. Given our choices, every arc ai has an associated height h(ai ), namely the vertical\ncoordinate of the point of A where the oriented geodesic representing ai enters the cusp. For\nsimplicity, we may assume that h(a0 ) = 0 and h(ak ) = h(\u03c8(a0 )) > 0. See Figure 5.\nTo estimate distances on the annulus A, we place many copies of the fiber F into pleated\nform. That is, for each ideal triangulation \u03c4i , i \u2208 Z, Proposition 2.4 implies that the fiber\nF \u00d7 {0} \u2282 N\u03c8 = F \u00d7 R can be homotoped in N\u03c8 to a pleated surface Fi realizing the\ntriangulation \u03c4i . Recall that every ideal triangle of \u03c4i is totally geodesic in Fi .\nFor each pleated surface Fi , Lemma 2.6 gives a possibly self-intersecting, piecewise geodesic\nclosed curve \u03b3i \u2282 A, which is homotopic to a loop about the puncture p. The curve \u03b3i is\nnot necessarily contained in Fi \u2229 A, but we do know that the vertices where it bends are the\nendpoints of edges of \u03c4i meeting the annulus A. See Figure 1 for a review.\nLemma 4.2. Each piecewise linear closed curve \u03b3i \u2282 A, determined by the pleated surface\nFi , has length `(\u03b3i ) \u2264 \u22126 \u03c7(F ).\nProof. Lemma 2.6 states that `(\u03b3i ) = `(\u2202Ri ) = area(Ri ), where Ri \u2282 Fi is an embedded\nhorospherical neighborhood of the puncture p. By Lemma 3.6, area(Ri ) \u2264 \u22126 \u03c7(F ).\n\u0003\nSee Agol [3, Theorem 5.1] or Lackenby [27, Lemma 3.3] for a very similar statement, on\nwhich Lemma 4.2 is based.\nApplying Lemma 4.2 to the pleated surface Fi gives a height estimate.\nLemma 4.3. The heights of consecutive arcs satisfy |h(ai ) \u2212 h(ai\u22121 )| < \u22123 \u03c7(F ).\nProof. By construction, the arcs ai\u22121 and ai have endpoints at the puncture p. Additionally,\nthe geodesic representatives of both arcs are contained in the triangulation \u03c4i along which Fi\nis bent. Thus the piecewise geodesic closed curve \u03b3i , containing the vertices at the forward\nendpoints of ai\u22121 and ai , must visit heights h(ai\u22121 ) and h(ai ). See Figure 6, left. Since\n`(\u03b3i ) \u2264 \u22126 \u03c7(F ), and this closed curve covers the distance between heights h(ai\u22121 ) and h(ai )\nat least twice, we conclude that\n|h(ai ) \u2212 h(ai\u22121 )| < \u22123 \u03c7(F ).\n\n\f18\n\nDAVID FUTER AND SAUL SCHLEIMER\n\nai\n\nai\n\nh(ai )\n\n\u03b3i\n\n\u03b3i\n\nai\u22121\n\nh(ai )\n\nh(ai\u22121 )\n\nai\u22121\n\nh(ai\u22121 )\n\nFigure 6.

Right: the shape of \u03b3i\nthat maximizes the area of the band Bi between heights h(ai\u22121 ) and h(ai ).\nThe inequality is strict because \u03b3i must also travel around a horizontal loop in A.\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 4.2 also leads to an area estimate.\nLemma 4.4. Let Bi \u2282 A be the band whose boundary consists of horizontal circles at heights\nh(ai\u22121 ) and h(ai ). Then area(Bi ) \u2264 9 \u03c7(F )2 .\nProof. As in the proof of Lemma 4.3, we study the piecewise geodesic closed curve \u03b3i \u2282 A.\nSince \u03b3i meets both ai\u22121 and ai , it must meet both boundary components of Bi . The goal\nis to determine the shape of \u03b3i that allows the largest possible area for Bi .\nWithout loss of generality, we may assume that \u03b3i contains exactly two geodesic segments\nconnecting the two boundary circles of Bi : otherwise, one can straighten \u03b3i while stretching\nBi . Such a piecewise-linear loop consisting of two segments splits Bi into two isometric\ntriangles: one triangle below \u03b3i , and the other triangle above \u03b3i . See Figure 6, right.\nAt this point, we have reduced to the classical calculus problem of building a triangular\ncorral adjacent to a river. As is well-known, the optimal shape for \u03b3i is one where the two\nsegments have the same length and meet at right angles. By Lemma 4.2, the total length of\nthese two equal segments is at most \u22126 \u03c7(F ). Therefore, the maximum possible area for Bi\nis 9 \u03c7(F )2 .\n\u0003\nWe can now complete the proof of Theorem 4.1. A fundamental domain for the torus \u2202C is\nthe portion of A between height h(a0 ) = 0 and height h(ak ) = h(\u03c8(a0 )). This fundamental\ndomain is contained in B1 \u222a . . . \u222a Bk . (The containment might be strict, since there is\nno guarantee that the sequence h(ai ) is monotonically increasing; see Figure 5.)

Let F be an orientable hyperbolic surface with a preferred puncture p, and let\n\u03c8 : F \u2192 F be an orientation-preserving, pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism such that \u03c8(p) = p.\nIn the mapping torus M\u03c8 , let C be the maximal cusp that corresponds to p. Then\narea(\u2202C) \u2264 9 \u03c7(F )2 dA (\u03c8)\n\nand\n\nheight(\u2202C) < \u22123 \u03c7(F ) dA (\u03c8).\n\n\fCUSP GEOMETRY OF FIBERED 3\u2013MANIFOLDS\n\n19\n\nCorollary 4.5 differs from Theorem 4.1 in that dA has been replaced by dA . Since dA (\u03c8) \u2264\ndA (\u03c8) by triangle inequalities, the statement of Corollary 4.5 is slightly sharper.\nProof of Corollary 4.5. Let n \u2265 1. The maximal cusp C of M\u03c8 lifts to an embedded horocusp\nin M\u03c8n , whose area is n * area(\u2202C). Applying Theorem 4.1 to M\u03c8n , we obtain\nn * area(\u2202C) \u2264 9 \u03c7(F )2 dA (\u03c8 n ).\nThus\ndA (\u03c8 n )\nn\u22651\nn\ndA (\u03c8 n )\n\u2264 9 \u03c7(F )2 lim inf\nn\u2192\u221e\nn\n2\n\u2264 9 \u03c7(F ) dA (\u03c8).\n\narea(\u2202C) \u2264 9 \u03c7(F )2 inf\n\nThe identical calculation goes through for height(\u2202C).\n\n\u0003\n\nProof of Theorem 1.5, upper bound. Let \u03c6 : F \u2192 F be a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism,\nand let \u03c8 = \u03c6n be the smallest power of \u03c6 that fixes the puncture p. Let C be the maximal\ncusp of M\u03c6 corresponding to p. Then C lifts to a (not necessarily maximal) horocusp\nC 0 \u2282 M\u03c8 , which is a one-sheeted cover of C. Corollary 4.5 gives upper bounds on the area\nand height of the maximal cusp of M\u03c8 , which implies upper bounds on the (possibly smaller)\narea and height of C.\n\u0003\n5. Upper bound: quasi-Fuchsian manifolds\nIn this section, we prove the upper bounds of Theorem 1.7. The proof strategy is nearly\nthe same as the proof of Theorem 4.1, with the quasi-Fuchsian manifold N \u223c\n= F \u00d7 R playing\nthe same role as N\u03c8 in the previous section. The main geometric difference is that core(N\u03c8 )\nis the whole manifold, whereas core(N ) has finite volume and finite cusp area.\nLet C \u2282 N be the maximal cusp corresponding to the puncture p of F . As in Section 4, we\nchoose geodesic coordinates on A = \u2202C \u223c\n= S 1 \u00d7 R, in which the R direction is vertical. Since\ncore(N ) is convex, the intersection core(N ) \u2229 A must be a compact annulus whose boundary\nis a pair of horizontal circles. We choose the orientation on R so that \u2202+ core(N ) is higher\nthan \u2202\u2212 core(N ). Then every oriented essential arc ai \u2282 N whose forward endpoint is at C\nhas a well-defined height h(ai ), namely the vertical coordinate of the point on A where the\ngeodesic homotopic to ai enters the cusp. See Figure 5.\nFollowing Definition 1.6, let \u2206\u00b1 (N ) be the simplex in A(F, p) consisting of all shortest arcs\nfrom p to p in \u2202\u00b1 core(N ). Let a0 \u2208 \u2206\u2212 (N ) and ak \u2208 \u2206+ (N ) realize the distance between\nthese simplices, so that\nk = dA (a0 , ak ) = dA (N, p).\nSince a0 has both of its endpoints at p, we may choose the orientation on a0 so that the\npoint where a0 enters the cusp is the lower of the two endpoints. Similarly, we choose the\norientation on ak so that the point where ak enters the cusp is the higher of the two endpoints.\nLemma 5.1. Let B \u2282 A be the compact annular band whose boundary consists of horizontal\ncircles at heights h(a0 ) and h(ak ). Then\narea(B) \u2264 9 \u03c7(F )2 dA (N, p)\n\nand\n\n|h(ak ) \u2212 h(a0 )| < \u22123 \u03c7(F ) dA (N, p).\n\n\f20\n\nDAVID FUTER AND SAUL SCHLEIMER\n\nProof. This follows from the results of Section 4. Let a0 , a1 , . . . , ak be the vertices of a\ngeodesic in A(1) (F, p) between a0 and ak . Then, for every i, let Bi \u2282 A be the annular band\nwhose boundary consists of horizontal circles at heights h(ai\u22121 ) and h(ai ). By Lemmas 4.3\nand 4.4,\narea(Bi ) \u2264 9 \u03c7(F )2 and |h(ai ) \u2212 h(ai\u22121 )| < \u22123 \u03c7(F ).\nAdding up these estimates as i ranges from 1 to k gives the result.\n\u0003\nTo prove the upper bounds of Theorem 1.7, it remains to estimate the area and height\nof the part of core(N ) \u2229 A that is not contained in the band B. To make this region more\nprecise, define h\u00b1 (N ) to be the vertical coordinate of the circle \u2202\u00b1 core(N ) \u2229 A. Then we\nmay define B\u2212 = B\u2212 (N ) to be the band whose boundary consists of horizontal circles at\nheights h\u2212 (N ) and h(a0 ), and similarly B+ = B+ (N ) to be the band between heights h(ak )\nand h+ (N ). Note that the orientations of a0 and ak were chosen precisely so as to minimize\nthe size of B\u2212 (N ) and B+ (N ), respectively.\nRecall that \u2202\u2212 core(N ) is an intrinsically hyperbolic surface, pleated along a lamination.\nThe arc a0 has a geodesic representative in \u2202\u2212 core(N ); in fact, by definition this geodesic is\nshortest in \u2202\u2212 core(N ) among all arcs from p to p. Then h\u2212 (N ) is the height at which the\ngeodesic representative of a0 in \u2202\u2212 core(N ) enters the cusp C, and h(a0 ) is the height at which\nthe geodesic representative of a0 in N enters the cusp C. The difference |h(a0 ) \u2212 h\u2212 (N )| is\nthe height of B\u2212 (N ). We control |h(a0 ) \u2212 h\u2212 (N )| via the following proposition.\nProposition 5.2. Let \u03b3 \u2282 N be an oriented, essential arc from cusp C back to C, which is\ndisjoint from the interior of C. Let g \u2282 N be the geodesic in the homotopy class of \u03b3. Let\nh(\u03b3) be the height at which \u03b3 enters C, and h(g) be the height at which g enters C.\nAssume that the\n\u221a orientation of \u03b3 has been chosen to minimize |h(g) \u2212 h(\u03b3)|. Then either\n|h(g) \u2212 h(\u03b3)| \u2264 2, or\n\u221a\n\u221a \u0001\n`(\u03b3) \u2212 ln 3 + 2 2 + 2 2\n`(\u03b3)\n=\n+ 0.5328...,\n(5.1)\n|h(g) \u2212 h(\u03b3)| \u2264\n2\n2\nwhere `(\u03b3) is the arclength of \u03b3.\nProof. Lift \u03b3 to an arc \u03b3\ne \u2282 H3 . The oriented arc \u03b3\ne runs from horoball H 0 to horoball\nH. Let ge be the corresponding lift of g, namely the oriented geodesic from H 0 to H. Let\nd+ = d+ (g, \u03b3) be the distance along \u2202H between the endpoints of ge and \u03b3\ne on H, and similarly\nlet d\u2212 = d\u2212 (g, \u03b3) be the distance along \u2202H 0 between the endpoints of ge and \u03b3\ne on H 0 . Since\nthe orientation of \u03b3 has been chosen to minimize |h(g) \u2212 h(\u03b3)|, we have\nd\u2212 + d+\n.\n2\nThus, to bound |h(g) \u2212 h(\u03b3)|, it will suffice to bound the average of d\u2212 and d+ .\nNext, we reduce the problem from three to two dimensions, as follows. Consider cylindrical\ncoordinates (r, \u03b8, z) on H3 , with the geodesic ge at the core of the cylinder. Thus r measures\ndistance from ge, while \u03b8 is the rotational parameter, and z measures distance along ge. With\nthese coordinates, the hyperbolic metric becomes\n(5.2)\n\n(5.3)\n\n|h(g) \u2212 h(\u03b3)| \u2264 min{d\u2212 (g, \u03b3), d+ (g, \u03b3)} \u2264\n\nds2 = dr2 + sinh2 (r) d\u03b82 + cosh2 (r) dz 2 .\n\nWe claim that no generality is lost by assuming \u03b3\ne lies in the half-plane corresponding to\n\u03b8 = 0. This is because the expression for the metric in (5.3) is diagonalized, hence the map\n(r, \u03b8, z) 7\u2192 (r, 0, z) is distance\u2013decreasing. Thus replacing \u03b3\ne by its image in this half-plane\n0\nonly makes it shorter. Furthermore, horoballs H and H are rotationally symmetric about ge,\n\n\fCUSP GEOMETRY OF FIBERED 3\u2013MANIFOLDS\n\n\u03b3\ne\n\n`1\n`2\n`0 \u2212 `2\n\n21\n\n`2\nge \u2282 \u03b2\n\n`3 \u2212 `2\n\nH0\n\nH\n\nFigure 7. The setup of Proposition 5.2. When the endpoints of \u03b3\ne are sufficiently far apart, the shortest path that stays disjoint from the interiors of\nH and H 0 is the three-piece blue arc, of length (`0 \u2212 `2 ) + `1 + (`3 \u2212 `2 ).\nhence the new planar curve is still disjoint from their interiors. Finally, observe that rotation\nabout ge keeps the endpoints of \u03b3\ne a constant distance from ge \u2229 H 0 and ge \u2229 H, respectively.\nThus the quantities d\u2212 (g, \u03b3) and d+ (g, \u03b3) are unchanged when we replace \u03b3\ne by its rotated\nimage. From now on, we will assume that \u03b3\ne lies in the copy of H2 for which \u03b8 \u2208 {0, \u03c0}.\nRecall that \u03b3\ne is disjoint from the interiors of H and H 0 . When its endpoints are sufficiently\nfar apart from ge, the geodesic between those points would pass through the interiors of the\nhoroballs. Instead, the shortest path that stays outside H and H 0 follows the boundary of\nH 0 , then tracks a hyperbolic geodesic tangent to H 0 and H, then follows the boundary of\nH. (See Figure 7.) The following lemma estimates the length of the geodesic segment in the\nmiddle of this path.\nLemma 5.3. Let H and H 0 be horoballs in H2 with disjoint interiors. Let \u03b1 \u2282 H2 be a\nhyperbolic geodesic such that H and H 0 are both tangent to \u03b1, on the same side of \u03b1. Let\n\u03b2 \u2282 H2 be a hyperbolic geodesic perpendicular to both H and H 0 . If `1 denotes the length\nalong \u03b1 from H \u2229 \u03b1 to H 0 \u2229 \u03b1, and `2 denotes the length along \u2202H from H \u2229 \u03b1 to H \u2229 \u03b2,\nthen\n\u0010\n\u221a\n\u221a \u0011\nand\n`2 \u2264 2.\n`1 \u2265 ln 3 + 2 2\nEach inequality becomes equal if and only if H is tangent to H 0 .\nProof. Let g be the geodesic segment of \u03b1 whose length is `1 . For the first inequality, apply\nan isometry of H2 so that g \u2282 \u03b1 is vertical in the upper half-plane model, so that H is the\nlarger horoball, and so that the Euclidean radius of H is 1. Then the point of tangency \u03b1 \u2229H\nis at Euclidean height 1. (See Figure 8, left.)

Since one endpoint\n\u221a of g is at height 1 and the other endpoint is\nat height r, we have `1 = ln(1/r) \u2265 ln(3 + 2 2).\nFor the second inequality, apply an isometry of H2 so that \u2202H is a horizontal line at\nEuclidean height 1. Then \u03b1 is a Euclidean semicircle of radius 1, and the horoball H 0\nmust have Euclidean radius r \u2264 1/2. (See\n\u221a Figure 8, right.) Again, a calculation with the\n\u0003\nPythagorean theorem implies that `2 \u2264 2, with equality if and only if r = 1/2.\nReturning to the proof of Proposition 5.2, we import the notation of Lemma 5.3. That\nis: the geodesic \u03b1 is tangent to H and H 0 , while the geodesic \u03b2 contains ge. Let `1 and `2\nbe as in the lemma. Let `0 = d\u2212 (g, \u03b3) be the distance along \u2202H 0 between the ge \u2229 \u2202H 0 and\n\u03b3\ne \u2229 \u2202H 0 , and let `3 = d+ (g, \u03b3).\n\u221a\n\u221a If one of `0 = d\u2212 or `3 = d+ is no longer than 2, then equation (5.2) gives |h(g) \u2212 h(\u03b3)|\n\u221a\u2264\n2 as well, and the proof is complete. Otherwise, if `0 and `3 are both longer than 2,\nthen Lemma 5.3 implies that they are longer than `2 . As a consequence, the shortest path\nbetween the endpoints of \u03b3\ne that stays disjoint from H and H 0 will need to track horoball\n0\nH for distance (`0 \u2212 `2 ), then follow geodesic \u03b1 for distance `1 , then track horoball H for\ndistance (`3 \u2212 `2 ).

Let C \u2282 N be a maximal cusp corresponding to the\npuncture p of F . As above, \u2202C \u2229 core(N ) decomposes into three compact annular bands: the\nband B\u2212 between heights h\u2212 (N ) and h(a0 ), the band B between heights h(a0 ) and h(ak ),\nand the band B+ between heights h(ak ) and h+ (N ).\nThe area and height of B were bounded in Lemma 5.1. As for B\u2212 , let a0 \u2208 \u2206\u2212 (N ) be one\nof the arcs from C to C that is shortest on \u2202\u2212 core(N ). Let \u03b3 be the geodesic in \u2202\u2212 core(N )\nin the homotopy class of a0 .

Let N be a hyperbolic 3\u2013manifold, F a surface, and f0 : F \u2192 N a map\nsending punctures to cusps. Fix a connected set J \u2282 R. A sweepout through f0 is a map\n\u03a8 : F \u00d7 J \u2192 N , thought of as a one-parameter family of maps \u03a8t : F \u2192 N , each homotopic\nto f0 .\nA sweepout \u03a8 is called geometric if every \u03a8t is a simplicial hyperbolic map: that is, for\nevery t \u2208 J, the image Ft = \u03a8t (F ) is a hyperbolic cone surface with at most one cone point\nof angle 2\u03c0 \u2264 \u03b8t < 4\u03c0. Note that a pleating map along an ideal triangulation is a special\ncase of a simplicial hyperbolic map.\nLet gt be the hyperbolic cone metric on F induced by \u03a8t . Then the continuity of \u03a8\nimplies that gt varies continuously with t. In particular, the lengths of geodesic realizations\nof homotopy classes of arcs and curves (with respect to gt ) vary continuously with t.\nDefinition 6.2. Let M = M\u03c8 be a fibered hyperbolic 3\u2013manifold with fiber F and monodromy \u03c8. Let N = N\u03c8 be the infinite cyclic cover of M , with deck transformation\nZ : N \u2192 N . Fix r > 0 and define z : F \u00d7 R \u2192 F \u00d7 R by z(x, t) = (\u03c8(x), t + r). We\nsay a sweepout \u03a8 : F \u00d7 R \u2192 N is equivariant if each \u03a8t is properly homotopic to the fiber,\nand\nZ \u25e6 \u03a8 = \u03a8 \u25e6 z.\nNote that equivariance implies that \u03a8 descends to a degree-one sweepout of M .\nProposition 6.3. Let M = M\u03c8 be a fibered hyperbolic 3\u2013manifold with fiber F and monodromy \u03c8. Let N = N\u03c8 be the infinite cyclic cover. Then there is a geometric, equivariant\nsweepout \u03a8 : F \u00d7 R \u2192 N .\nThis result originates in the work of Thurston [36, Theorem 9.5.13]; see page 9.47 in\nparticular. A careful account of the proof was also written down by Canary [13, Sections\n4\u20135]. What follows below is a review of their argument, adapted to ideal triangulations.\nProof of Proposition 6.3. Let \u03c40 be an ideal triangulation of F . Hatcher proved [24] that\nthe triangulations \u03c40 and \u03c8(\u03c40 ) can be connected by a sequence of diagonal exchanges, as in\nFigure 9. Thus we have a sequence of ideal triangulations, \u03c40 , \u03c41 , . . . , \u03c4r = \u03c8(\u03c40 ), where each\n\u03c4i differs from \u03c4i\u22121 by a diagonal exchange. We extend the sequence of triangulations \u03c4i to\na bi-infinite sequence {\u03c4i | i \u2208 Z}, such that \u03c4i+r = \u03c8(\u03c4i ).\nFix an embedding f0 : F \u2192 N isotopic to the fiber. By Proposition 2.4, for each i \u2208 Z\nwe may take \u03a8i : F \u2192 N to be a pleating of f0 along \u03c4i . We choose these pleating maps so\nthat Z \u25e6 \u03a8i = \u03a8i+r \u25e6 \u03c8. Define Fi = Im(\u03a8i ) and notice that, since \u03c4i differs from \u03c4i\u22121 by a\ndiagonal exchange, Fi differs from Fi\u22121 by an ideal tetrahedron \u2206i .\nFix i \u2208 Z. Let \u03b5i\u22121 be the edge of \u03c4i\u22121 that is exchanged for the edge ei of \u03c4i . Because\nall six edges of the tetrahedron \u2206i lift to hyperbolic geodesics, the edges \u03b5i\u22121 and ei lift to\nhyperbolic geodesics with no shared endpoints at infinity. In H3 , this pair of geodesics is\n\n\f24\n\nDAVID FUTER AND SAUL SCHLEIMER\n\n\u03b5i\u22121\n\n\u21d2\n\nei\n\nxt\n\nFigure 9. Left: a diagonal exchange in a quadrilateral. Center right: a diagonal exchange between two pleated surfaces creates a 3\u2013dimensional tetrahedron \u2206i . Right: a singular quadrilateral Qt interpolates between the top\nand bottom pleated sides of the tetrahedron.\njoined by a unique geodesic segment \u03b3 that meets \u03b5i\u22121 , ei perpendicularly. (In the special\ncase where \u03b5i\u22121 and ei intersect, \u03b3 has length 0.)\nNow, for every t \u2208 [i \u2212 1, i], let xt be the point on \u03b3 that is distance `(\u03b3)(t \u2212 i + 1) from\n\u03b5i\u22121 and distance `(\u03b3)(i \u2212 t) from ei . In other words, xt is obtained by linear interpolation\nbetween the points where \u03b3 meets \u03b5i\u22121 and ei . We construct a (singular) ideal quadrilateral\nQt by coning xt to the four edges of \u2206i r(ei \u222a \u03b5i\u22121 ). (See Figure 9, right.) Finally, let Ft be\nthe surface that includes the quadrilateral Qt inside the tetrahedron \u2206i , and agrees with Fi\neverywhere else. Recall that Fi\u22121 agrees with Fi outside \u2206i .\nFor t \u2208 (i \u2212 1, i), we take \u03a8t : F \u2192 N\u03c8 to be a simplicial hyperbolic map with image Ft .\nWe choose the maps \u03a8t so that \u03a8|F \u00d7[i\u22121,i] is continuous and so that Z \u25e6 \u03a8t = \u03a8t+r \u25e6 \u03c8.\nNow consider the geometry of Ft = \u03a8t (F ). Wherever this surface agrees with Fi , it is built\nout of ideal triangles, and inherits an intrinsically hyperbolic metric from N\u03c8 . Meanwhile,\nthe quadrilateral Qt where Ft disagrees with Fi is constructed out of four (2/3)\u2013ideal triangles\nthat share a vertex at xt . Thus the surface Ft has a smooth hyperbolic metric everywhere\nexcept at xt . At this cone point, observe that the singular quadrilateral Qt is not contained\nin any hyperbolic half-space through xt . As a result, a lemma of Canary [13, Lemma 4.2]\nimplies that the cone angle at xt is \u03b8t \u2265 2\u03c0. Also, because each of the four triangles meeting\nat xt has an interior angle less than \u03c0, we have \u03b8t < 4\u03c0.\nSince the triangulations \u03c4i satisfy \u03c4i+r = \u03c8(\u03c4i ), we have\nZ \u25e6 \u03a8t = \u03a8t+r \u25e6 \u03c8,\n\nfor all t \u2208 R.\n\nTherefore, \u03a8 is the desired equivariant, geometric sweepout of N .\n\n\u0003\n\nThe above construction extends nicely to quasi-Fuchsian manifolds.\nProposition 6.4. Let N \u223c\n= F \u00d7 R be a cusped quasi-Fuchsian 3\u2013manifold. Let \u03c4, \u03c4 0 be ideal\ntriangulations of F . Then there exists a geometric sweepout \u03a8 : F \u00d7 [0, r] \u2192 N, such that \u03a80\nis the pleating map along \u03c4 and \u03a8r is the pleating map along \u03c4 0 .\nProof. We repeat the proof of Proposition 6.3, without needing to worry about equivariance.\nLet \u03c4 = \u03c40 , \u03c41 , . . . , \u03c4r = \u03c4 0 be a sequence of ideal triangulations of F , with each \u03c4i differing\nfrom \u03c4i\u22121 by a diagonal exchange. Then each \u03c4i can be realized by a pleated surface Fi ,\nand we may interpolate from Fi\u22121 to Fi by a 1\u2013parameter family of simplicial hyperbolic\nsurfaces, as in Figure 9.\n\u0003\nLemma 6.5. Let \u03a8 : F \u00d7 [0, r] \u2192 N be a geometric sweepout in a hyperbolic 3\u2013manifold N .\nLet C be an embedded horocusp in N , with longitude of length \u03bb. Then, for every surface\nFt = \u03a8t (F ) in the sweepout, C \u2229 Ft contains an equidistant cusp neighborhood whose area is\nat least \u03bb.\n\n\fCUSP GEOMETRY OF FIBERED 3\u2013MANIFOLDS\n\n25\n\nRecall that an equidistant cusp of a hyperbolic cone surface is defined in Definition 3.2.\nProof of Lemma 6.5. This is identical to the proof of Lemma 2.5, with pleated surfaces replaced by simplicial hyperbolic surfaces. First, take a horocusp C0 \u2282 C small enough so that\nFt \u2229 C0 is a non-singular, horospherical cusp Rt0 . If d denotes the distance between \u2202C0 and\n\u2202C, then area(Rt0 ) \u2265 e\u2212d \u03bb. Then Ft \u2229 C contains an equidistant d\u2013neighborhood of Rt0 . By\nLemma 3.5, this equidistant neighborhood Rt satisfies\narea(Rt ) \u2265 ed area(Rt0 ) \u2265 \u03bb.\n\n\u0003\n\n7. Lower bound: fibered manifolds\nIn this section, we prove the lower bound of Theorem 1.5. We begin with a slightly more\nrestricted statement:\nTheorem 7.1. Let F be an orientable hyperbolic surface with a preferred puncture p, and let\n\u03c8 : F \u2192 F be an orientation-preserving, pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism such that \u03c8(p) = p.\nIn the mapping torus M\u03c8 , let C be a horocusp corresponding to p, whose longitude has length\n\u03bb = 21/4 . Then there exists an integer n \u2265 1, such that\narea(\u2202C) >\n\ndA (\u03c8 n )\n450 \u03c7(F )4\n\nand\n\nheight(\u2202C) >\n\ndA (\u03c8 n )\n.\n536 \u03c7(F )4\n\nTheorem 7.1 differs from the lower bound of Theorem 1.5 in several small ways. First, it\nrestricts attention to horocusps that have longitude of length 21/4 . (This choice of longitude\nis justified by Lemma 2.7, which represents the best available lower bound on the longitude.)\nSecond, Theorem 7.1 restricts attention to monodromies that fix the puncture p. (Given an\narbitrary pseudo-Anosov \u03c6, one can let \u03c8 be the smallest power of \u03c6 such that \u03c8(p) = p.)\nFinally, Theorem 7.1 estimates cusp area and height in terms of the translation distance\ndA (\u03c8 n ) for an unspecified integer n, rather than the stable translation distance dA (\u03c8). We\nshall see at the end of the section that this restricted statement quickly implies the lower\nbound of Theorem 1.5.\nProof of Theorem 7.1. As in Sections 4 and 6, it is convenient to work with the infinite cyclic\ncover of M\u03c8 , namely N\u03c8 \u223c\n= F \u00d7 R. The horocusps of M lift to annular, rank one cusps. Let\nA \u2282 N\u03c8 be the lift of \u2202C that corresponds to the puncture p of F . Then A is an annulus,\nwith longitude of length \u03bb = 21/4 , which covers the torus \u2202C.\nBy Proposition 6.3, there is a geometric, equivariant sweepout \u03a8 : F \u00d7 R \u2192 N\u03c8 . In\nparticular, for every t, we have Ft = \u03a8t (F ) is a hyperbolic cone surface with at most one\nsingular point of cone angle 2\u03c0 \u2264 \u03b8t < 4\u03c0.\nDefinition 7.2. Let Ft be a simplicial hyperbolic surface in N (such as one occurring in the\nsweepout). We say that an arc a \u2208 A(0) (F, p) is short on Ft if a runs from p to p, and if its\ngeodesic representative in the hyperbolic metric of Ft is shortest among all such arcs.\nNote that a given surface Ft can have multiple short arcs. However, all short arcs on Ft\nhave disjoint representatives, by Lemma 3.3.\nFor each surface Ft , Lemma 3.8 gives an explicit upper bound on the length of a short\narc in Ft (hence, also on its length in N\u03c8 ). On the cusp annulus A, each short arc gives\na shadow of a horoball, with area bounded below. More precisely, we obtain the following\nquantitative estimate.\n\n\f26\n\nDAVID FUTER AND SAUL SCHLEIMER\n\nLemma 7.3. Let a \u2208 A(0) (F, p) be an arc that is short on Ft for some t. Then, on the cusp\nannulus A \u2282 N\u03c8 , the arc a corresponds to a pair of disjoint disks, each of radius\n\u221a\n2\nr= 2\n.\n8\u03c0 \u03c7(F )2\nFurthermore, if an arc b is short on Ft0 for some t0 , and a 6= b \u2208 A(0) (F, p), then the disks\ncorresponding to a and b are disjoint on A.\nProof. By convention (and by Lemma 2.7), the longitude of A has length \u03bb = 21/4 . Thus,\nby Lemma 6.5, the intersection between Ft and the horocusp of N\u03c8 contains an equidistant\ncusp neighborhood Rt , of area at least 21/4 . Therefore, by Lemma 3.8, the length of a short\narc a in Ft rRt is\n`(a) < 2 ln 2\u03c0 \u03c7(F )/21/4 .\nSince Ft is immersed in N\u03c8 as a piecewise geodesic union of hyperbolic triangles, this immersion is distance-decreasing. Thus, in N\u03c8 , the geodesic ga in the homotopy class of a must\nalso be shorter than the above estimate.\nLift N\u03c8 to the universal cover H3 in the upper half-space model, so that the cusp annulus\nA lifts to a horizontal horosphere at Euclidean height 1. Let H\u221e be the horoball above this\nhorosphere. This means that ga lifts to a vertical geodesic that starts at height 1 and ends\nat the top of a horoball Ha , of diameter\n\u221a\n2\n\u2212`(a)\n(7.1)\ne\n\u2265 2\n.\n4\u03c0 \u03c7(F )2\nIn H3 , there is a covering transformation for N\u03c8 that maps Ha to H\u221e , and maps H\u221e\nto another horoball Ha0 . The diameter of Ha0 must be the same as that of Ha because they\nlie at the same distance from H\u221e (namely, the length of ga ). This new horoball Ha0 cannot\nbelong to the same orbit as Ha under the parabolic subgroup \u03c01 (A) = Z preserving H\u221e :\nfor, this parabolic subgroup preserves the orientation on all the lifts of ga , but one lift of\nga is oriented downward toward Ha whereas the other is oriented upward from Ha0 toward\nH\u221e . Thus the shadows of Ha and Ha0 are disjoint disks on the horosphere at height 1, which\nproject to disjoint disks Da and Da0 on A because Ha and Ha0 are in different\u221aorbits. After\nshrinking Da and Da0 if necessary, we obtain a pair of disjoint disks of radius 2/8\u03c0 2 \u03c7(F )2 .\nNow, suppose that b is another arc from p to p, not isotopic to a, such that b is short on Ft0\nfor some t0 . Then, performing the same construction as for a, we obtain a pair of horoballs Hb\nand Hb0 , whose heights also satisfy equation (7.1). The four horoballs Ha , Ha0 , Hb , Hb0 must lie\nin distinct orbits of the parabolic Z subgroup preserving \u221e, because a and b are in distinct\nhomotopy classes on F . Thus the four horoballs are disjoint in H3 . Their shadows on H\u221e\nare not \u221a\nnecessarily disjoint. However, if we shrink all four horoballs until their diameter is\nexactly 2/4\u03c0 2 \u03c7(F )2 , then the shadows of disjoint horoballs of the same size are themselves\ndisjoint.\nSince Ha , Ha0 , Hb , Hb0 lie in distinct\nunder \u03c01 (A), we obtain four disjoint disks\n\u221a orbits\n0\n0\n2\nDa , Da , Db , Db in A, each of radius 2/8\u03c0 \u03c7(F )2 .\n\u0003\nTo obtain a lower bound on the area and height of \u2202C, we need to find a sequence of arcs\nin F , each of which is short in a surface Ft for some t.\nLemma 7.4. There is a sequence of real numbers 0 = t0 , t1 , . . . , tk = r and an associated\nsequence a0 , a1 , . . . , ak of arcs embedded in F , with the following properties:\n(1) Each ai is short on Fti .\n\n\fCUSP GEOMETRY OF FIBERED 3\u2013MANIFOLDS\n\n27\n\n(2) The first and last arcs satisfy ak = \u03c8(a0 ).\n(3) Each ai is disjoint from ai\u22121 . In other words, [ai\u22121 , ai ] is an edge of A(F, p).\nProof. Let a be an embedded arc in F from p to p. Define\nS(a) := {t \u2208 R | a is shortest on Ft among all arcs from p to p}.\nIn other words, S(a) consists of those values of t for which a is short (as in Definition 7.2).\nAccording to the definition of a geometric sweepout (Definition 6.1) the length of any arc\nvaries continuously with t. Since being shortest is a closed condition it follows that the set\nS(a) is closed. Also, since every surface Ft in the sweepout has a short arc, the line R is\ncovered by the sets S(a), as a varies over the vertices of A(F, p).\nWe claim that the arcs a for which S(a) 6= \u2205 belong to finitely many \u03c8\u2013orbits. This\nis because every \u03c8\u2013orbit of arcs in F descends to a single arc in M\u03c8 , with distinct orbits\ndescending to distinct arcs. The two endpoints of a geodesic ga \u2282 M\u03c8 representing the arc a\nmust be distinct in \u2202C (otherwise, a deck transformation of M\u03c8 would reverse the orientation\nof a lift of ga , fixing a point in the middle). The two endpoints of ga on \u2202C are the centers\nof disjoint disks guaranteed by Lemma 7.3. Thus, by Lemma 7.3, every orbit of arcs that is\nshortest on some Ft makes a definite contribution to area(\u2202C). On the other hand, area(\u2202C)\nis bounded above (e.g. by Theorem 4.1), hence there can be only finitely many \u03c8\u2013orbits of\narcs for which S(a) 6= \u2205.\nNext, we claim that each S(a) is compact. Fix an arc a, and let ga be the geodesic in\nN\u03c8 that is homotopic to a. Note that the sweepout of N\u03c8 must eventually exit: that is, as\n|t| \u2192 \u221e, Ft must leave any compact set in N\u03c8 . Thus, as |t| \u2192 \u221e, the distance from Ft to the\ngeodesic ga becomes unbounded (outside the horocusp C). However, any path in Ft that is\nhomotopic to ga but remains outside an s\u2013neighborhood of ga must be extremely long (with\nlength growing exponentially in s). Therefore, when |t| \u001d 0, the geodesic representative of\na on Ft must be very long, and in particular cannot be the shortest arc on Ft . This means\nthat S(a) is bounded, hence compact.\nWe can now conclude that there are only finitely many arcs a for which S(a) \u2229 [0, r] 6= \u2205.\nBy the first claim above, these arcs belong to finitely many \u03c8\u2013orbits. Within each orbit, the\ncompact sets S(a) and S(\u03c8(a)) differ by a translation by r. Thus only finitely many sets in\neach \u03c8\u2013orbit can intersect [0, r].\nLet a0 be an arc that is short on F0 ; that is, 0 \u2208 S(a0 ). Then \u03c8(a0 ) is short on Fr . Since\nthe connected interval [0, r] is covered by finitely many closed sets S(a), a lemma in point-set\ntopology (Lemma B.1 in the Appendix) implies that one may \"walk\" from S(a0 ) to S(\u03c8(a0 ))\nby intersecting sets: there is a real number t1 \u2208 S(a0 ) \u2229 S(a1 ), a number t2 \u2208 S(a1 ) \u2229 S(a2 ),\nand so on, for arcs a0 , . . . , ak = \u03c8(a0 ).\nBy definition, ti \u2208 S(ai\u22121 ) \u2229 S(ai ) means that both ai\u22121 and ai are short on Fti . Thus, by\nLemma 3.3, [ai\u22121 , ai ] is an edge of A(F, p). We have therefore constructed a walk through\nthe 1\u2013skeleton of A(F, p), from a0 to ak = \u03c8(a0 ), through arcs ai that are each short on\nsome simplicial hyperbolic surface.\n\u0003\nLemma 7.5. The sequence of arcs a0 , a1 , . . . , ak in Lemma 7.4 contains a subsequence\nb0 , b1 , . . . , bm with the following properties:\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n\nEach bi is short on Fti .\nThe arcs b1 , . . . , bm are all in distinct \u03c8\u2013orbits.\nThe first and last arcs satisfy bm = \u03c8 n (b0 ), for some integer n 6= 0.\nEach bi is disjoint from bi\u22121 . In other words, [bi\u22121 , bi ] is an edge of A(F, p).\n\n\f28\n\nDAVID FUTER AND SAUL SCHLEIMER\n\nProof. The arcs a0 , a1 , . . . , ak in Lemma 7.4 constitute a walk through the 1\u2013skeleton of\nA(F, p), from a0 to ak = \u03c8(a0 ). Given that this walk exists, one can excise some of the ai\nif necessary to form a loop-erased walk a0 to ak = \u03c8(a0 ). That is, one may walk from a0\nto ak = \u03c8(a0 ) through some subcollection of the ai , without visiting the same isotopy class\nmore than once.\nNext, suppose that there are indices i < j, such that ai and aj belong to the same \u03c8\u2013orbit.\nWithout loss of generality, assume that i, j are an innermost pair with this property. This\nmeans that aj = \u03c8 n (ai ) for some n 6= 0, and ai+1 , . . . , aj are all in distinct \u03c8\u2013orbits. Now,\nwe simply restrict attention to the subsequence from i to j. That is, let b0 = ai , b1 = ai+1 ,\nand so on, until bm = aj for m = j \u2212 i. This subsequence satisfies the lemma.\n\u0003\nWe can now complete the proof of Theorem 7.1. Notice that in Lemma 7.5, b0 , b1 , . . . , bm\nn ). By Lemma\nare the vertices of a path through A(1) (F, p) from b0 to \u03c8 n (b0 ). Thus m \u2265 dA (\u03c8\u221a\n0\n7.3, each arc bi corresponds to two disjoint disks Di , Di \u2282 A, each of radius 2/8\u03c0 2 \u03c7(F )2 .\nFurthermore, for j 6= i, the disks Di , Di0 , Dj , Dj0 are all disjoint. Thus we have at least\n2dA (\u03c8 n ) disjoint disks altogether. Since the arcs b1 , . . . , bm are all in different \u03c8\u2013orbits,\nthese disks project to 2dA (\u03c8 n ) disjoint disks on the cusp torus \u2202C \u2282 M\u03c8 .\nTo obtain a lower bound on area(\u2202C), we\n\u221a sum up the areas of these disjoint disks, and\nmultiply by the circle packing constant of 2 3/\u03c0 (see [7, Theorem 1]).

Let \u03c6 : F \u2192 F be a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism,\nand let \u03c8 = \u03c6n be the smallest power of \u03c6 that fixes the puncture p. Let C be an embedded\ncusp of M\u03c6 corresponding to p, whose longitude has length \u03bb = 21/4 . By Lemma 2.7, an\nembedded cusp of this size exists, and is smaller than the maximal cusp of M\u03c6 . Thus all\nlower bounds on C also apply to the maximal cusp.\nIn the cover M\u03c8 , C lifts to an embedded horocusp C1 \u2282 M\u03c8 , which is a one-sheeted\ncover of C. Furthermore, for every integer m \u2265 1, the mapping torus M\u03c8m contains an\nembedded horocusp Cm whose longitude has length 21/4 and which forms an m\u2013fold cover\nof C. Consider what Theorem 7.1 says about the geometry of Cm .\nBy Theorem 7.1, there exists an integer n(m) \u2265 m, such that\narea(\u2202Cm ) >\n\ndA (\u03c8 n(m) )\n450 \u03c7(F )4\n\nand\n\nheight(\u2202Cm ) >\n\ndA (\u03c8 n(m) )\n.\n536 \u03c7(F )4\n\nBecause Cm is an m\u2013fold cover of C, both its area and its height are m times larger than\nthose of C.

An identical calculation goes through for height(\u2202C).\n\u0003\n8. Lower bound: quasi-Fuchsian manifolds\nIn this section, we prove the lower bounds of Theorem 1.7. The argument uses almost\nexactly the same ingredients as the proof of Theorem 7.1. The one additional ingredient is\nthe ability to approximate the convex core boundary by surfaces pleated along triangulations.\nProposition 8.1. Let N \u223c\n= F \u00d7 R be a cusped quasi-Fuchsian 3\u2013manifold, and p a puncture\nof F . As in Definition 1.6, let \u2206\u2212 (N ) be the simplex of A(F, p) whose vertices are the\nshortest arcs from p to p in the lower core boundary \u2202\u2212 core(N ). Then there is an ideal\ntriangulation \u03c4 of F , such that in the pleated surface F\u03c4 pleated along \u03c4 , each shortest arc\nfrom p to p is distance at most 1 from \u2206\u2212 (N ).\nThe same statement holds for the simplex \u2206+ (N ).\nProof. Let R0 \u2282 \u2202\u2212 core(N ) be a horospherical cusp neighborhood about puncture p, such\nthat area(R0 ) = 1. Note that by Lemma 2.8, the neighborhood R0 is embedded. For any\narc a from puncture p to p in F , let `0 (a) be the length of the geodesic representing a, in\nthe hyperbolic metric of \u2202\u2212 core(N ), outside the cusp neighborhood R0 . Let `N (a) be the\nlength of the geodesic representing a in the 3\u2013manifold N , outside a cusp neighborhood of\nlongitude 1. Define the set\nn\no\n(8.1) T (N ) = a \u2208 A(0) (F, p) | both ends of a are at p, `N (a) < 2 ln |6\u03c7(F )| + ln(2) .\nNote that by Lemmas 2.5 and 3.8, every arc a \u2208 \u2206\u2212 (N ) has length\n`N (a) \u2264 `0 (a) \u2264 2 ln |6\u03c7(F )|.\nThus the simplex \u2206\u2212 (N ) of shortest arcs in \u2202\u2212 core(N ) must be contained in T (N ). Also\nnote that T (N ) must be a finite set: one way to see this is to recall (e.g. from Lemma 7.3)\nthat every arc of bounded length makes a definite contribution to area(\u2202C \u2229 core(N )).\nNow, we apply Theorem A.1: there exists a sequence of triangulations \u03c4i of F , such that\nthe hyperbolic metrics on the pleated surfaces F\u03c4i converge in the Teichm\u00fcller space T (F ) to\n\u2202\u2212 core(N ). For each i, let Ri \u2282 F\u03c4i be an embedded cusp neighborhood of area 1. For each\narc a \u2282 F , let `i (a) be the length of the geodesic representing a, in the induced hyperbolic\nmetric on F\u03c4i , relative to the cusp neighborhood Ri . Note that `N (a) \u2264 `i (a) by Lemma 2.5.\nThen, because the metrics on F\u03c4i converge to that on \u2202\u2212 core(N ), the length of any arc also\nconverges. In particular, because T (N ) is a finite set of arcs, there is some k \u001d 0 such that\n(8.2)\n\n|`k (a) \u2212 `0 (a)| < ln(2)/3,\n\n\u2200a \u2208 T (N ).\n\nLet \u03c4 = \u03c4k , and let b be any shortest arc on F\u03c4 = F\u03c4k . By Lemma 3.8, `k (b) \u2264 2 ln |6\u03c7(F )|.\nFurthermore, `N (b) \u2264 `k (b), since the pleating map that produces F\u03c4k is 1\u2013Lipschitz. Then,\nby equation (8.1), it follows that b \u2208 T (N ). Thus, for any arc a that is shortest on \u2202\u2212 core(N )\n(that is, a \u2208 \u2206\u2212 (N )), we obtain\n(8.3)\n\n`0 (b) \u2212 ln(2)/3 < `k (b) \u2264 `k (a) < `0 (a) + ln(2)/3,\n\nwhere the outer inequalities follow by (8.2) and the middle inequality holds because b is\nshortest on F\u03c4 . A simpler way to state the conclusion of (8.3) is that on the hyperbolic\nsurface \u2202\u2212 core(N ),\n`0 (b) < `0 (a) + 2 ln(2)/3.\n\n\f30\n\nDAVID FUTER AND SAUL SCHLEIMER\n\nSince a is shortest on \u2202\u2212 core(N ), and b is nearly shortest, Lemma 3.4 implies that a and\nb are disjoint (or the same arc) for any a \u2208 \u2206\u2212 (N ). Thus b is distance at most 1 from\n\u2206\u2212 (N ).\n\u0003\nWe can now begin proving the lower bound of Theorem 1.7. Applying the same ideas as\nin Section 7 gives the following analogue of Lemma 7.4.\nLemma 8.2. Let N \u223c\n= F \u00d7 R be a cusped quasi-Fuchsian 3\u2013manifold, and p a puncture of\nF . There is a sequence a0 , a1 , . . . , ak of arcs embedded in F , and an associated sequence\nof simplicial hyperbolic surfaces Ft(ai ) \u2282 N with at most one singular point of cone angle\n2\u03c0 \u2264 \u03b8t < 4\u03c0, such that the following hold:\n(1) Each ai is short on Ft(ai ) , in the sense of Definition 7.2.\n(2) The arcs a0 , . . . , ak are distinct up to isotopy.\n(3) Ft(a0 ) is the lower core boundary \u2202\u2212 core(N ), and Ft(ak ) = \u2202+ core(N ).\n(4) Each ai is disjoint from ai\u22121 . In other words, [ai\u22121 , ai ] is an edge of A(F, p).\nProof. As in Definition 1.6, let \u2206\u2212 (N ) be the simplex of A(F, p) whose vertices are the short\narcs on the lower boundary \u2202\u2212 core(N ). By Proposition 8.1, there is a triangulation \u03c4 of F ,\nand a pleated surface F\u03c4 pleated along \u03c4 , such that a short arc on this pleated surface either\nbelongs to the simplex \u2206\u2212 (N ), or is at distance 1 from some vertex of \u2206\u2212 (N ). Similarly,\nthere is a triangulation \u03c4 0 of F , and a pleated surface F\u03c4 0 pleated along \u03c4 0 , whose short arc\neither belongs to the simplex \u2206+ (N ), or is at distance 1 from some vertex of \u2206+ (N ).\nBy Proposition 6.4, there is a geometric sweepout \u03a8 : F \u00d7 [0, r] \u2192 N , where each Ft =\n\u03a8(F \u00d7 {t}) is a hyperbolic cone surface with at most one singular point of cone angle\n2\u03c0 \u2264 \u03b8t < 4\u03c0. Furthermore, F0 = F\u03c4 and Fr = F\u03c4 0 , for the given triangulations \u03c4 and \u03c4 0 .\nNext, we apply the argument of Lemma 7.4. In the quasi-Fuchsian setting, the proof\nsimplifies in several ways. There is no need to worry about equivariance, and the set of arcs\n{a : S(a) 6= \u2205} is finite because it is contained in T (N ) from equation (8.1). We thus obtain\na sequence of arcs a1 , . . . , ak\u22121 with the following properties.\n\u2022 Each ai is short on some surface Ft(ai ) in the sweepout.\n\u2022 Arc a1 is short on F0 = F\u03c4 , and ak\u22121 is short on Fr = F\u03c4 0 .\n\u2022 Each ai is disjoint from ai\u22121 . In other words, [ai\u22121 , ai ] is an edge of A(F, p).\nNext, we extend this sequence of arcs to the convex core boundary. If a1 \u2208\n/ \u2206\u2212 (N ), then\nthere is an arc a0 \u2208 \u2206\u2212 (N ), which is shortest on \u2202\u2212 core(N ) by definition, and such that\n[a0 , a1 ] is an edge of A(F, p). Otherwise, if a1 \u2208 \u2206\u2212 (N ), then we simply shift indices by 1,\nso that a1 becomes a0 . Similarly, if ak\u22121 \u2208\n/ \u2206+ (N ), then we add an arc ak \u2208 \u2206+ (N ), which\nis shortest on \u2202+ core(N ). Otherwise, if ak\u22121 \u2208 \u2206+ (N ), then we simply redefine k := k \u2212 1,\nand stop the sequence there.\nWe now have a sequence of arcs a0 , . . . , ak , with associated simplicial hyperbolic surfaces\nFt(ai ) , so that this sequence satisfies all the conclusions of the lemma except possibly (2).\nThat is, some of the ai might be in the same isotopy class. But if the arcs a0 , . . . , ak are the\nvertices of a path in A(1) (F, p), then some subcollection of the ai give an embedded path.\nThis means that (2) is satisfied, and the proof is complete.\n\u0003\nLemma 8.3. Let N \u223c\n= F \u00d7 R be a cusped quasi-Fuchsian manifold, and p a puncture of\nF . Let C \u2282 N be a horocusp corresponding to the puncture p, whose longitude is \u03bb = 21/4 .\nThen, for some k \u2265 dA (N, p), the annulus A = \u2202C contains 2k + 2 disjoint disks, each of\nradius\n\u221a\n2\n,\nr= 2\n8\u03c0 \u03c7(F )2\n\n\fCUSP GEOMETRY OF FIBERED 3\u2013MANIFOLDS\n\n31\n\nsuch that the center of each disk is in the convex core core(N ).\nRecall that by Lemma 2.7, there is indeed an embedded horocusp of longitude \u03bb = 21/4 .\nRecall as well, from Definition 1.6, that dA (N, p) is defined to be the shortest distance in\nA(F, p) between a vertex of \u2206\u2212 (N ) and a vertex of \u2206+ (N ).\nProof of Lemma 8.3. The sequence of arcs a0 , . . . , ak , constructed in Lemma 8.2, is a walk\nthrough the 1\u2013skeleton of A(F, p) from a vertex of \u2206\u2212 (N ) to a vertex of \u2206+ (N ). Thus, by\nDefinition 1.6, k \u2265 dA (N, p).\nFor each i \u2208 {0, . . . , k}, let gai be the geodesic in N in the homotopy class of ai . Then,\nLemma 7.3 guarantees that there is a pair of disjoint disks Dai and Da0 i , of radius r =\n\u221a\n2/8\u03c0 2 \u03c7(F )2 , whose centers are the endpoints of gai on the cusp annulus A. Since the\ngeodesic gai is contained in the convex core of N , the centers of Dai and Da0 i lie in core(N )\nas well.\nFinally, Lemma 7.3 also implies that if j 6= i, the disks of ai are disjoint from those of aj .\nThus we have at least 2k + 2 disks in total.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 1.7, lower bound. Let p be a puncture of F , and let C \u2282 N be a horospherical cusp corresponding to the puncture p, whose longitude is \u03bb = 21/4 . Note that by\nLemma 2.7, C is contained in the maximal cusp about puncture p. Thus lower bounds on\nthe area and height of \u2202C \u2229 core(N ) also apply to the maximal cusp.\nAs in Section 4 and 5, we may place Euclidean coordinates on the annulus A = \u2202C \u223c\n=\n1\nS \u00d7 R, in which the R direction is vertical. Let B \u2282 A be a compact annular band, with\nboundary consisting of horizontal circles, which is the smallest such\n\u221a band that contains all\nof the 2k + 2 disks of Lemma 8.3. Since each disk has radius r = 2/8\u03c0 2 \u03c7(F )2 , B\u00f6r\u00f6czky's\nestimate on the density of a circle packing [7, Theorem 1] implies that\n!2\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2\n3 (dA (N ) + 1)\ndA (N ) + 1\n2 3\n* (2dA (N ) + 2) * \u03c0\n=\n>\n.\narea(B) \u2265\n2\n2\n4\n4\n\u03c0\n8\u03c0 \u03c7(F )\n8\u03c0 \u03c7(F )\n450 \u03c7(F )4\nSimilarly, since area(B) = \u03bb * height(B), and we have normalized the horocusp so that\n\u03bb = 21/4 , we have\n\u221a\n(dA (N ) + 1)\n3 (dA (N ) + 1)\nheight(B) \u2265 1/4 4\n>\n.\n4\n536 \u03c7(F )4\n2 8\u03c0 \u03c7(F )\nTo complete the proof, it remains is to bound the difference in area (or height) between B\nand \u2202C \u2229 core(N ). Note that by Lemma 8.3, each of the (2k + 2)\u221adisks has its center inside\ncore(N ). Therefore, the upper boundary of B is at most r = 2/8\u03c0 2 \u03c7(F )2 higher than\n\u2202+ core(N ), and the lower boundary of B is at most r lower than \u2202\u2212 core(N ).

Covers and the arc complex\nIn this section, we will apply Theorem 1.7 to prove Theorem 1.9, which relates the arc\ncomplex of a surface S to that of its cover \u03a3. The proof uses some classical results in Kleinian\ngroups to construct a quasi-Fuchsian manifold with prescribed short arcs on its convex core\nboundary (see Lemma 9.2). We begin by recalling some terminology and results, while\npointing the reader to Marden [28, Chapter 3] for a more detailed reference.\nLet \u0393 be a Kleinian group with limit set \u039b. The domain of discontinuity is \u03a9 = \u2202H3 r\u039b.\nWhen N = H3 /\u0393 is quasi-Fuchsian, \u03a9 is the disjoint union of two open disks \u03a9+ and \u03a9\u2212 , each\nof which admits a conformal, properly discontinuous action by \u0393. The quotients S\u00b1 = \u03a9\u00b1 /\u0393\nare Riemann surfaces, called the (top and bottom) conformal boundary of N = H3 /\u0393.\nFor each quasi-Fuchsian manifold N , there is a natural \"nearest point retraction\" map\nr : S\u00b1 \u2192 \u2202\u00b1 core(N ). Sullivan proved that, if S\u00b1 is given the unique hyperbolic metric in\nits conformal class, the map r : S\u00b1 \u2192 \u2202\u00b1 core(N ) is K\u2013Lipschitz, for a universal constant\nK > 1. Much more recently, Epstein, Marden, and Markovic [18] showed that the optimal\nLipschitz constant is 2. We will use their result for concreteness, while emphasizing that\nSullivan's original K\u2013Lipschitz statement is all that is truly needed.\nWe also recall some facts from the geometry of surfaces. Let \u03b52 be the 2\u2013dimensional\nMargulis constant. For any simple closed geodesic \u03b3 in a hyperbolic surface S, of length\n` = `(\u03b3) < \u03b52 , the \u03b52 \u2013thin region of S containing \u03b3 is an embedded collar of radius r(`).\nThe function r(`) is monotonically decreasing, and r(`) \u2192 \u221e as ` \u2192 0. See Buser [12] for\nexplicit estimates on \u03b52 and r(`).\nDefinition 9.1. Let S be a hyperbolic surface, and \u03b3 a simple closed geodesic on S. We say\nthat \u03b3 is sufficiently thin if its length ` = `(\u03b3) is short enough that the \u03b52 \u2013thin collar about\n\u03b3 has radius\n(9.1)\n\nr(`) > ln |6\u03c7(S)/\u03b52 |.\n\nThis requirement on collar radius is motivated by Lemma 3.8.\nGiven this background, we can prove the following constructive lemma.\nLemma 9.2. Let F be a surface with a preferred puncture p, and let a\u2212 , a+ \u2208 A(0) (F, p) be\narcs from p to p. Then there exists a quasi-Fuchsian manifold N \u223c\n= F \u00d7 R, such that a\u00b1 is\nthe unique shortest arc from p to p on \u2202\u00b1 core(N ).\nProof. Let R0 \u2282 F be a neighborhood of the puncture p, and let R(a+ ) be a regular neighborhood of R0 \u222a a+ . This is topologically a pair of pants, whose frontier in F consists of a\npair of essential closed curves c+ , c0+ . (If F is a once-punctured torus, then c+ is isotopic to\nc0+ ; this will not affect our arguments.) Similarly, let c+ , c0+ be closed curves that form the\nfrontier of a regular neighborhood R(a\u2212 ).\nChoose hyperbolic metrics X\u00b1 on F , in which the geodesic representatives of c\u00b1 and\nc0\u00b1 have less than half the length required to be sufficiently thin. By Bers simultaneous\nuniformization [28, page 136], there is a quasi-Fuchsian manifold N \u223c\n= F \u00d7 R whose top\nconformal boundary is X+ and whose bottom conformal boundary is X\u2212 . Thus, by Epstein,\nMarden, and Markovic [18], the geodesic representatives of c\u00b1 and c0\u00b1 are sufficiently thin\non \u2202\u00b1 core(N ).\nWe claim that a+ is the unique shortest arc from p to p on \u2202+ core(N ). For concreteness,\nwe will measure lengths relative to the horospherical cusp neighborhood Q(p) \u2282 \u2202+ core(N )\nwhose boundary has length \u03b52 . Since horoballs are convex, it follows that Q(p) is \u03b52 \u2013thin.\n\n\fCUSP GEOMETRY OF FIBERED 3\u2013MANIFOLDS\n\n33\n\nThen, by Lemma 3.8, there must be a geodesic \u03b1+ from p to p whose length relative to this\ncusp neighborhood satisfies\n`(\u03b1+ ) \u2264 2 ln |6\u03c7(S)/\u03b52 |.\nNow, let b+ be any arc from p to p, other than a+ . Since b+ is not isotopic into the\nneighborhood R(a+ ), it must cross c+ \u222a c0+ . By the Margulis lemma, the \u03b52 \u2013thin collars\nabout those curves are disjoint from the \u03b52 \u2013thin cusp neighborhood Q(p). Thus, since c+\nand c0+ are sufficiently thin, and the width of a collar is twice the radius, equation (9.1)\nimplies that `(b+ ) > `(\u03b1+ ). Therefore a+ = \u03b1+ , the unique shortest arc from p to p.\nBy the same argument, a\u2212 is the unique short arc on \u2202\u2212 core(N ).\n\u0003\nWe can now complete the proof of Theorem 1.9, which we restate.\nTheorem 1.9. Let \u03a3 and S be surfaces with one puncture, and f : \u03a3 \u2192 S a covering\nmap of degree n. Let \u03c0 : A(S) \u2192 A(\u03a3) be the lifting relation induced by f . Then, for all\na, b \u2208 A(0) (S), we have\nd(a, b)\n\u2212 2 < d(\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2264 d(a, b)\n4050 n \u03c7(S)6\nwhere \u03b1 \u2208 \u03c0(a) and \u03b2 \u2208 \u03c0(b).\nProof. Recall that by Definition 1.8, \u03c0(a) is the set of n vertices in A(\u03a3) representing arcs\nthat project to a. These vertices form a simplex in A(\u03a3), since the arcs that comprise f \u22121 (a)\nare disjoint. Similarly, if a and a0 are distance 1 in A(S), then all the 2n lifts of a and a0 are\ndisjoint in \u03a3, hence every vertex \u03b1 \u2208 \u03c0(a) is distance 1 in A(\u03a3) from every vertex \u03b10 \u2208 \u03c0(a0 ).\nThus, by induction on distance, we have\nd(\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2264 d(a, b)\nfor any \u03b1 \u2208 \u03c0(a) and any \u03b2 \u2208 \u03c0(b).\nTo prove the other inequality in Theorem 1.9, assume the cover is non-trivial: that is,\nn > 1. Fix a, b \u2208 A(0) (\u03a3). By Lemma 9.2, there is a quasi-Fuchsian manifold M \u223c\n= S \u00d7 R,\nsuch that a is the unique shortest arc on \u2202\u2212 core(M ) and b is the unique shortest arc on\n\u2202+ core(M ).\nSince S has a unique puncture p, we have A(S) = A(S, p). Let C \u2282 M be the maximal\nhorospherical cusp corresponding to this unique puncture. By Definition 1.6, dA (M, p) =\nd(a, b). Thus, by the lower bound of Theorem 1.7,\n(9.2)\n\n1\nd(a, b)\n\u2212\n< area(\u2202C \u2229 core(M )).\n4\n450 \u03c7(S)\n23 \u03c7(S)2\n\nUse the n\u2013fold covering map f : \u03a3 \u2192 S to lift the hyperbolic metric on M \u223c\n= S \u00d7 R to a\nquasi-Fuchsian structure on N \u223c\n= \u03a3 \u00d7 R. The convex core of N covers the convex core of M .\nThe horocusp C \u2282 M lifts to a horocusp D \u2282 N , which is an n\u2013sheeted cover of C. Thus\n(9.3)\n\nn * area(\u2202C \u2229 core(M )) = area(\u2202D \u2229 core(N )).\n\nObserve that every arc a \u2208 \u2202+ core(M ) lifts to n disjoint arcs in \u2202+ core(N ), each of which\nhas the same length as a (outside the horocusps C and D, respectively). Thus the n arcs of\n\u03c0(b) are shortest on \u2202+ core(N ), and similarly the n arcs of \u03c0(a) are shortest on \u2202\u2212 core(N ).\nBy Definition 1.6, this implies dA (N, p) \u2264 d(\u03b1, \u03b2) for any \u03b1 \u2208 \u03c0(a) and any \u03b2 \u2208 \u03c0(b).\nTherefore, the upper bound of Theorem 1.7 implies\n(9.4)\n\narea(\u2202D \u2229 core(N )) < 9 \u03c7(\u03a3)2 d(\u03b1, \u03b2) + 12\u03c7(\u03a3) ln |\u03c7(\u03a3)| + 26\u03c7(\u03a3) .\n\n\f34\n\nDAVID FUTER AND SAUL SCHLEIMER\n\nCombining equations (9.2), (9.3) and (9.4), we obtain\nn * d(a, b)\nn\n\u2212\n< 9 \u03c7(\u03a3)2 d(\u03b1, \u03b2) + 12\u03c7(\u03a3) ln |\u03c7(\u03a3)| + 26\u03c7(\u03a3) ,\n450 \u03c7(S)4 23 \u03c7(S)2\nwhich can be rearranged, using \u03c7(\u03a3) = n\u03c7(S), to give\n12\u03c7(\u03a3) ln |\u03c7(\u03a3)| + 26\u03c7(\u03a3)\nd(a, b)\n1\n\u2212\n\u2212\n< d(\u03b1, \u03b2).\n4050 n \u03c7(S)6 23 * 9 n \u03c7(S)4\n9\u03c7(\u03a3)2\nSince \u03a3 is a once-punctured surface that non-trivially covers S, we have |\u03c7(\u03a3)| \u2265 3. It\nfollows that the additive error on the left-hand side is bounded above by 2. This completes\nthe proof.\n\u0003\nAppendix A. Approximating the convex core boundary\nThe goal of this appendix is to write down a proof of the following result, which is needed\nin the argument of Section 8.\nTheorem A.1. Let N \u223c\n= F \u00d7 R be a cusped quasi-Fuchsian 3\u2013manifold. Then there is\na sequence \u03c4i of ideal triangulations of F , such that the induced hyperbolic metrics on the\npleated surfaces F\u03c4i converge in the Teichm\u00fcller space T (F ) to the hyperbolic metric on the\nlower core boundary \u2202\u2212 core(N ). Furthermore, the pleating maps for the F\u03c4i converge in the\ncompact\u2013open topology to a pleating map for \u2202\u2212 core(N ).\nThe same statement holds for the upper core boundary \u2202+ core(N ).\nThe statement of Theorem A.1 is entirely unsurprising, and morally it should fit into the\ntoolbox of well-known results about laminations and pleated surfaces [14, Chapters 4 and\n5]. Indeed, the standard toolbox of Kleinian group theory leads to a relatively quick proof\nof the theorem. However, this short proof is also somewhat technical, as it requires passing\nbetween several different topologies on spaces of laminations and pleated surfaces.\nThe main reference for the following argument is Canary, Epstein, and Green [14]. See\nalso Thurston [36, 38], Bonahon [6], and Ohshika [31].\nDefinition A.2. Let S be a punctured hyperbolic surface of finite area. Let GL(S) denote\nthe set of geodesic laminations on S: that is, laminations where each leaf is a geodesic. We\nequip GL(S) with the Chabauty topology. In this topology, a sequence {Li } converges to\nL \u2208 GL(S) if and only if:\n(1) If a subsequence xni \u2208 Lni converges to x \u2208 S, then x \u2208 L.\n(2) For all x \u2208 L, there exists a sequence xi \u2208 Li , such that xi \u2192 x.\nThe Chabauty topology is metrizable [14, Proposition 3.1.2]. In fact, when restricted to\ncompact laminations, the Chabauty topology reduces to be the Hausdorff topology (induced\nby the Hausdorff distance between compact sets). See [14, Section 3.1] for more details.\nDefinition A.2 makes use of a hyperbolic metric on S, but in an inessential way. If we\nmodify a metric d to a new hyperbolic metric d0 , each lamination L \u2208 GL(S) that is geodesic\nin d can be straightened to a geodesic lamination of d0 . This straightening does not affect\nconvergence of laminations. Thus the space GL(S) only depends on the topology of S.\nWe use the term curve to denote a simple closed geodesic in S. The following lemma is a\ngood example of convergence in the Chabauty topology.\nLemma A.3. For every curve \u03b1 \u2282 S, there is a sequence of ideal triangulations \u03c4i , converging in the Chabauty topology to a lamination \u03b10 \u2283 \u03b1.\n\n\fCUSP GEOMETRY OF FIBERED 3\u2013MANIFOLDS\n\n35\n\nProof. Fix any ideal triangulation \u03c4 . Let D = D\u03b1 be a Dehn twist about \u03b1. Then \u03c4i = Di (\u03c4 )\nconverges to the desired \u03b10 .\n\u0003\nDefinition A.4. Let S be a punctured hyperbolic surface of finite area. Then ML(S)\ndenotes the space of compact, transversely measured laminations. Every point of ML(S) is\na pair (L, \u03bc) where L is a compact geodesic lamination and \u03bc is a transverse measure of full\nsupport. That is, for each arc \u03b1 intersecting L transversely, \u03bc(\u03b1) is a positive number that\nstays invariant under an isotopy preserving the leaves of L. The natural topology on ML(S)\nis called the measure topology.\nLet PML(S) denote the projectivization of ML(S), in which nonzero measures that differ\nby scaling become identified. The measure topology on ML(S) descends to PML(S).\nIf L is a disjoint union of arcs and closed curves in S, an example of a transverse measure\nis the counting measure, where \u03bc(\u03b1) = |\u03b1 \u2229 L|. For another example, suppose that S =\n\u2202+ core(N ) is the upper boundary of the convex core in a quasi-Fuchsian 3\u2013manifold. Then\nthe pleating lamination L has a bending measure, where \u03bc(\u03b1) is the integral of the bending\nof \u03b1 as it crosses leaves of L.\nThe measure-forgetting map PML(S) \u2192 GL(S) is not continuous, but it has the following\nconvenient property.\nFact A.5. Suppose that (Li , \u03bci ) \u2192 (L, \u03bc) \u2208 PML(S), in the measure topology. Then, after\npassing to a subsequence, there is a lamination L0 \u2208 GL(S) so that L \u2282 L0 and Li \u2192 L0 in\nthe Chabauty topology.\nWith these facts in hand, we can prove Theorem A.1. The proof contains two steps, the\nfirst of which deals with laminations only.\nLemma A.6. Let L \u2208 GL(S) be a measurable lamination. Then there is a sequence of ideal\ntriangulations \u03c4i converging in the Chabauty topology to a lamination L00 \u2283 L.\nProof. Pick \u03bc, a measure of full support on L, so that (L, \u03bc) \u2208 PML(S).\nThurston proved that curves, equipped with the counting measure, are dense in PML(S)\n[6, Proposition 15]. Thus we may pick a sequence of curves {\u03b1i } converging to (L, \u03bc) in\nthe measure topology. By Fact A.5, we may pass to a subsequence and reindex so that \u03b1i\nconverges, in the Chabauty topology, to a lamination L0 containing L.\nBy Lemma A.3, we may choose {\u03c4i,j }, a sequence of sequences of ideal triangulations, so\nthat for all i\n\u03c4i,j \u2192 \u03b1i0 \u2283 \u03b1i as j \u2192 \u221e.\nFor all i, choose an increasing function j : N \u2192 N, so that \u03c4i,j(i) and \u03b1i0 have distance at most\n1/i, in the metric that induces the Chabauty topology.\nClaim. The sequence \u03c4i,j(i) contains a subsequence converging to L00 \u2283 L0 .\nProof of claim. As GL(S) is compact [14, Proposition 4.1.6], the sequence \u03c4i,j(i) contains a\nconvergent subsequence. In an abuse of notation, denote this convergent subsequence by\n\u03c4i = \u03c4i,j(i) . Let L00 be the limit of the \u03c4i . Note that L00 is not compact.\nRecall that the Chabauty distance between \u03c4i and \u03b1i0 is at most 1/i. Thus the sequence\n0\n\u03b1i has the same limit as \u03c4i , namely L00 . Since \u03b1i \u2282 \u03b1i0 , it follows by [14, Lemma 4.1.8] that\nthe limit of \u03b1i must be contained in the limit of \u03b1i0 . That is, L0 \u2282 L00 , as desired.\n\u0003\nSince L \u2282 L0 , Lemma A.6 is proven.\n\n\u0003\n\n\f36\n\nDAVID FUTER AND SAUL SCHLEIMER\n\nThe second step of the argument connects the above discussion of laminations to pleated\nsurfaces. Following Definition 2.2, we call a lamination L \u2208 GL(S) realizable if it is realized\nby a pleating map f : S \u2192 N homotopic to a prescribed map f0 .\n\u223c S \u00d7 R be a cusped quasi-Fuchsian 3\u2013manifold, and fix an embedding\nLemma A.7. Let N =\nf0 : S \u2192 S \u00d7 {0}. Let Li \u2208 GL(S) be a sequence of laminations on S, which are realizable\nby pleating maps homotopic to f0 . Then, if Li \u2192 L0 in the Chabauty topology, and L \u2282 L0\nis also realizable, the hyperbolic metrics di induced by pleating along Li converge in T (S) to\nthe hyperbolic metric d induced by pleating along L.\nIn fact, the pleating maps fi : S \u2192 N converge to the pleating map f : S \u2192 N that realizes\nL, in the space MPS(S, N ) of marked pleated surfaces homotopic to f0 .\nWe refer the reader to [14, Definition 5.2.14] for the full definition of MPS(S, N ). It\nsuffices to note that convergence in MPS(S, N ) involves both convergence of metrics in\nT (S) and convergence of pleating maps in the compact-open topology.\nProof of Lemma A.7. Let C be an embedded neighborhood of the cusps of N . Then K :=\ncore(N )rC is a compact set, and every pleated surface homotopic to f0 must intersect K.\nWith this notation, [14, Theorem 5.2.18] implies that the space MPS(S, N ) = MPS(S, K)\nof marked pleated surfaces that intersect K is compact. In particular, the pleating maps\nfi : S \u2192 N , which pleat along lamination Li , have a convergent subsequence, fni \u2192 f\u221e . Let\nL\u221e be the pleating lamination of f\u221e .\nNow, recall that Li \u2192 L0 in the Chabauty topology, and L \u2282 L0 is realizable by a pleating\nmap f : S \u2192 N homotopic to f0 . Since every component of f (SrL) is totally geodesic in\nN , the leaves of L0 rL are mapped into these totally geodesic regions, hence L0 is realized\nby the same map f . In this setting, Ohshika [31, Lemma 1.3] notes that f\u221e = f is the same\npleating map that realizes the limiting lamination L0 .\nTherefore, every convergent subsequence of fi must limit to the same map f\u221e = f that\nrealizes the lamination L. Since MPS(S, K) is compact, this means that fi \u2192 f in the\ntopology on MPS(S, K). This means that fi \u2192 f in the compact-open topology, and also\nthat the hyperbolic metrics di induced by fi converge in T (S) to the hyperbolic metric d\ninduced by f .\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem A.1. Let N \u223c\n= F \u00d7 R be a cusped quasi-Fuchsian 3\u2013manifold, as in the\nstatement of the theorem. Let L be the pleating lamination on the lower core boundary\n\u2202\u2212 core(N ). The bending measure \u03bc on \u2202\u2212 core(N ) is a transverse measure of full support,\nso L is a measurable lamination. By Lemma A.6, there is a sequence of ideal triangulations\n\u03c4i \u2192 L0 in the Chabauty topology, where L \u2282 L0 . Now, by Lemma A.7, the pleating maps\nfi : F \u2192 N that pleat along \u03c4i induce hyperbolic metrics on F that converge in T (F ) to the\ninduced metric on \u2202\u2212 core(N ). By the definition of MPS(S, N ), these pleating maps also\nconverge in the compact\u2013open topology to a pleating map for \u2202\u2212 core(N ).\n\u0003\nAppendix B. A lemma in point-set topology\nLet X be a topological space, and let S be a cover of X by closed sets. Define a discrete walk\nof length k through sets of S to be a sequence of points x0 , x1 , . . . , xk , such that x0 , x1 \u2208 S1 ,\nx1 , x2 \u2208 S2 , and so on, for sets S1 , . . . , Sk that belong to S. We say this sequence is a walk\nfrom x0 to xk .\nThe following observation is needed in the proof of Lemma 7.4.\n\n\fCUSP GEOMETRY OF FIBERED 3\u2013MANIFOLDS\n\n37\n\nLemma B.1. Let X be a connected topological space, and let S1 , . . . , Sn be closed sets whose\nunion is X. Then, for any pair of points x, y \u2208 X, there is a discrete walk from x to y\nthrough sets in the collection {S1 , . . . , Sn }.\nProof. Define an equivalence relation \u2261 on X, where\nx\u2261y\n\n\u21d4\n\nthere exists a discrete walk from x to y through {S1 , . . . , Sn }.\n\nReversing and concatenating walks proves this is an equivalence relation. Furthermore,\neach closed set Si must be entirely contained in an equivalence class, because its points are\nconnected by a walk of length 1. Thus each equivalence class is closed. Since the connected\nspace X cannot be expressed as a disjoint union of finitely many closed sets, all of X must\nbe in the same equivalence class.\n\u0003\nReferences\n[1] Colin C.
