Despite this importance, however,\ndust in galaxies other than our own is not yet well understood.\nA useful tracer of the carbonaceous component of dust is the C H bond stretch of\naliphatic hydrocarbons, observed in absorption at 3.4\u03bcm (2941cm\u22121 ) throughout the Galactic diffuse ISM. This broad feature exhibits substructure corresponding to symmetric and\nasymmetric stretches of C H bonds in CH2 and CH3 groups in aliphatic hydrocarbon chains\n(Sandford et al. 1991), the relative strengths of which are related to the lengths of the chains\n(e.g. Alpert, Keiser & Szymanski 1970). In addition, chemical groups such as CO, CN, OH,\nand aromatic rings attached to the chains can change the force constants of the C H bonds,\nthereby causing shifts in the positions and intensities of the subpeaks within the band. The\n1\n\nBased on observations with the UK Infrared Telescope, Mauna Kea Observatory, Hawaii.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\noverall shape of the 3.4\u03bcm feature reflects this and can therefore be used to probe the chemical makeup of the dust.\nHydrocarbon-containing materials with quite different formation and processing histories may have similar 3.4\u03bcm band profiles which reflect the molecular environment of the\nC H bonds (Pendleton et al. 1994), and, as shown by Pendleton & Allamandola (2002),\nspectroscopy in the 5-9\u03bcm region is required to differentiate decisively between dust analog\nmaterials. At these wavelengths, features arising from C H bends, C C vibrations and\nvibrations of many other chemical bonds can also be present, allowing more complete identification of functional groups and comparisons between astronomical and laboratory spectra.\nHowever, while hydrocarbon materials with different histories can have similar 3.4\u03bcm profiles, this is not necessarily the case; laboratory spectra from a multitude of research groups\nreveal clear differences in many of the 3.4\u03bcm feature profiles (Pendleton & Allamandola\n2002). Moreover, unlike the 5-9\u03bcm region, the 3.4\u03bcm feature is accessible from groundbased observatories. To investigate the extent of these possible variations in the shape of the\n3.4\u03bcm feature, to provide data to complement future mid-IR spectral observations, and to\ndeepen our understanding of the carbonaceous dust in the Universe, it will be instructive to\ncompare spectra of the 3.4\u03bcm feature in different Galactic and extragalactic environments.\nObservations have been made along a number of Galactic lines of sight, sampling the\ndiffuse ISM towards the Galactic center and a number of reddened field stars and YSOs, and\nthe newly-formed circumstellar dust in the protoplanetary nebula, CRL618 (Butchart et\nal. 1986; McFadzean et al. 1989; Adamson, Whittet & Duley 1990; Lequeux & Jourdain\nde Muizon 1990; Sandford et al. 1991; Pendleton et al. 1994; Sandford, Pendleton &\nAllamandola 1995; Imanishi et al. 1996; Whittet et al. 1997; Chiar et al. 1998, 2000,\n2002; Ishii et al. 2002; Rawlings, Adamson & Whittet 2003). The 3.4\u03bcm feature has also\nbeen studied in the Murchison meteorite (Cronin & Pizzarello 1990; de Vries et al. 1993).\nWhere the quality of the data allows the comparison, the profile of the feature is very similar\nbetween lines of sight, as well as in some laboratory analog materials (e.g. Pendleton et al.\n1994; Chiar et al. 1998; Ishii et al. 2002; Pendleton & Allamandola 2002).\nThe 3.4\u03bcm band has also been detected in several Seyfert galaxies and ULIRGs (Bridger,\nWright & Geballe 1994; Mizutani, Suto & Maihara 1994; Wright et al. 1996; Imanishi et\nal. 1997; Imanishi 2000a,b; Imanishi & Dudley 2000; Imanishi, Dudley & Maloney 2001;\nImanishi 2002, 2003; Marco & Brooks 2003; Risaliti et al. 2003). In almost all cases,\nthe observations were aimed at establishing the power source of each galaxy through the\npresence or absence of the 3.4\u03bcm band and the 3.3\u03bcm PAH emission feature, rather than\nto examine in detail the chemical makeup of the dust. Wright et al. (1996) and Imanishi\net al. (1997) note the similarity of the 3.4\u03bcm feature in the Seyfert 2 galaxy, NGC1068,\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nwith that observed towards the Galactic center, and Wright et al. (1996) and Pendleton\n(1996, 1997) also compare the feature in the ULIRG, IRAS08572+3915, to the Galactic\ncenter, again finding a striking similarity. Risaliti et al. (2003) present an L-band spectrum\nof the southern nucleus of the Superantennae galaxies (IRAS19254-7245), and suggest that\nthe 3.4\u03bcm feature profile implies that the carbonaceous dust in that galaxy contains more\nelectronegative groups than that in the Galactic diffuse ISM3 .\nTo investigate in more detail the chemical composition of hydrocarbon dust in galaxies,\nwe have obtained new, higher signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) spectra of the feature towards the\nnucleus of NGC1068 and IRAS08572+3519 (\u00a73). We also present a new detection of the\nfeature towards the nucleus of the Seyfert 2 galaxy, NGC7674. In \u00a74 we compare the 3.4\u03bcm\nfeature of NGC1068, the galaxy with the best L-band spectrum, with that observed towards\nthe Galactic center and in the protoplanetary nebula CRL618, and with all of the galaxies in\nwhich this feature has been detected. Finally, in \u00a75 we analyse the 3.4\u03bcm band of NGC1068\nin conjunction with ISO mid-IR spectra of that galaxy, something which has to date only\nbeen possible for the line of sight to the Galactic Center (Chiar et al. 2000). The implications\nof this work for the composition, production and survival of carbonaceous dust are discussed\nin \u00a76.\n\n2.\n2.1.\n\nThe lines of sight\nThe Seyfert galaxies\n\nAs the galaxy in which Antonucci & Miller (1985) detected the first hidden broad\nline region in polarized light, NGC1068 is probably the most-studied active galaxy. At a\ndistance of 16Mpc (H0 = 70km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ), 1\u2032\u2032 corresponds to 70pc. The unified model of\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN) proposes that our view of the nucleus of NGC1068, a type 2\nSeyfert galaxy, is blocked by an edge-on dusty torus, and that the broad lines visible only\nin polarized light are deflected into our line of sight by a scattering mirror of electrons or\ndust. Emission from dust in the central few hundred pc of NGC1068 can clearly be seen in\nIR images of that galaxy (e.g. Tomono et al. 2001; Rouan et al. 2004). The 0.48\u2032\u2032 -wide slit\nused for the present observations was centered on the peak of the L-band emission, and the\ndisk of NGC1068 is quite close to face-on (i \u223c 29\u25e6 , see Table 1) so the spectrum presented\nhere comes from a region of the dust surrounding the central engine of this galaxy that is\n3\n\nSince the submission of this paper, Dartois et al. (2004) have also examined the 3.4\u03bcm band, hydrocarbon/silicate ratio and oxygen content of the carbonaceous dust in four galaxies.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nroughly comparable in size to a Galactic giant molecular cloud complex.\nNGC7674 is also a spiral galaxy with a Seyfert 2 nucleus. Like NGC1068, the disk of the\ngalaxy has a low inclination, so although NGC7674 is several times as distant as NGC1068,\nmuch of the dust that we observe is likely to be close to the active nucleus rather than in\nthe diffuse ISM of the galaxy. The other Seyfert galaxies in which the 3.4\u03bcm feature has\nbeen detected have greater inclinations. In these cases, there may be some contribution from\nabsorption by dust in the diffuse ISM of the spiral arms of the galaxy.\n\n2.2.\n\nThe ULIRGs\n\nThe deepest 3.4\u03bcm features yet observed in any lines of sight are found in the ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs, LIR > 1012 L\u2299 ), IRAS08572+3915, IRAS19254-7245 and\nUGC5101, along with a weaker feature in IRAS05189-2524 (Wright et al. 1996; Imanishi &\nDudley 2000; Imanishi et al. 2001; Risaliti et al. 2003), leading to the suggestion that the\nmajor power source in these ULIRGs is a deeply obscured AGN. This could mean that the\nfeature arises in dust close to the active nucleus, as is the case for some of the Seyfert galaxies. However, unlike the Seyfert galaxies with a classical spiral morphology, the ULIRGs are\noften disturbed, interacting systems, with dust lanes and discs crossing the nuclear regions\n(Scoville et al. 2000). Therefore it is possible that the 3.4\u03bcm band in these galaxies is\ncaused by a combination of both diffuse medium and circumnuclear dust.\nSome relevant properties of the galaxies examined in this paper are summarized in\nTable 1.\n\n3.\n\nObservations and data reduction\n\nSpectra of NGC7674 and IRAS08572 were obtained using CGS4 on the 3.8m United\nKingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) on Mauna Kea, in October 2000. The observations\nof IRAS08572 were completed in March 2001, as part of the UKIRT Service Programme.\nFor NGC7674, the 40 l/mm grating was used with a 2-pixel (1.2\") slit, giving a resolving\npower of \u223c 700. IRAS08572 was observed with the 150 l/mm grating and the 2-pixel slit,\nresulting in R\u223c 2600. NGC1068 was observed in November 2002 with UIST, UKIRT's\nimager/spectrometer. UIST's short-L grism and 4-pixel (0.48\") slit were used, for R\u223c 650.\nThe data were reduced using UKIRT's data reduction pipelines, CGS4DR and ORACDR,\nand the Starlink FIGARO package. After bad pixel masking, bias subtraction, and flatfielding, subtracted sky and object pairs were coadded into groups. Residual sky emission, which\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n\nTable 1.

Sky lines were cancelled by division by a standard\nstar. For IRAS08572 and NGC7674, wavelength calibration was achieved using observations\nof an argon arc lamp, but for the UIST observations of NGC1068, the arc lamp was observed through the H-band filter in second order, which induces a wavelength shift in the\nlines. Rather than correcting for this shift, HI lines in the standard star and the telluric CH4\nline were used for wavelength calibration.\nThe spectra of IRAS08572 and NGC7674 were obtained using more than one grating\nsetting. The separate spectra were merged by wavelength, being multiplied by a constant\nwhere necessary to achieve a good match in flux between the sections (these adjustments were\ngenerally < 10%) The wavelength calibration should ensure a good match in wavelength,\nbut this was checked using telluric lines where possible. The spectra were flux-calibrated\nusing the V- or K-band magnitudes of the telluric standard stars and appropriate V-K, K-L\nand K-L' colors. The results are generally consistent with published measurements, but as\nthe standard stars were selected primarily to ensure good cancellation of atmospheric lines\nrather than as photometric standards, the flux calibration should be considered approximate.\nData for NGC3094, NGC7172, NGC7479 and Mrk463, which were also acquired using\nCGS4 on UKIRT, were obtained from the UKIRT archive and reduced in the same way as the\ngalaxies described above. These data have previously been published by Imanishi (2000a,b,\n2002); the observational details are described therein. The L-band spectrum of IRAS19254\nwas aquired with the Infrared Spectrometer and Array Camera, ISAAC, on the Very Large\nTelescope (VLT), and has been published by Risaliti et al. (2003). We obtained the data from\nthe VLT Science Archive Database. Initially, the eclipse-isaac software package (Devillard\n1997) was used to flatfield, sky-subtract, wavelength-calibrate and combine the individual\nframes. Removal of residual sky emission, optimal extraction, division by a standard star\nand flux calibration were performed using FIGARO routines.\nSpectra of UGC5101 and IRAS04385, observed with NSFCAM and SpeX at NASA's\nIRTF, were kindly provided by M. Imanishi. The observations and reduction of the data\nare described in Imanishi et al. (2001) and Imanishi (2003). The spectrum of IRAS05189 is\nfrom Wright et al. (1996).\n\n3.1.\n\nOptical depth spectra\n\nFlux and optical depth spectra from the new data, together with the continua used to\nderive the optical depths, are presented in Figures 1, 2 and 3. These continua result from\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nfitting low-order polynomial curves to the spectra outside the rest-frame 3.30-3.55\u03bcm region.\nSeveral groups have measured the optical depth of the 3.4\u03bcm feature in NGC1068.\nImanishi et al. (1997) calculate \u03c43.42 = 0.126 \u00b1 0.014, slightly larger than the \u03c43.42 = 0.1\nderived by Wright et al. (1996). We measure \u03c43.42 \u2248 0.09. More recently, Marco & Brooks\n(2003) obtained a spectrum of NGC1068 in the 3.0-3.6\u03bcm range, with \u03c43.4 = 0.14. The\ndifferences in optical depth values between these studies probably result from differences in\naperture sizes and in the continua used to derive \u03c43.4 .\nL-band spectra of IRAS08572 have been obtained by Wright et al. (1996) and Imanishi\n& Dudley (2000), at \u03bb/\u2206\u03bb \u223c 380 in the latter case. Their spectra both have \u03c43.42 \u223c 0.7, as\ndoes the present spectrum. For NGC7674 we measure \u03c43.4 \u223c 0.07, and also detect weak PAH\nemission at 3.3\u03bcm. This is the first time that the 3.4\u03bcm feature has been reported in this\ngalaxy; the presence of the feature is not clear in the lower-resolution spectrum reported by\nImanishi (2003), who find \u03c43.4 < 0.2. In none of these galaxies is there any clear indication\nof the 3.1\u03bcm O H stretch characteristic of the ices observed in Galactic dense molecular\nclouds.\n\n4.\n\nComparison of the 3.4\u03bcm feature in Seyferts, ULIRGs and other dusty\nenvironments\n\nFig. 4 compares the 3.4\u03bcm feature in NGC1068 with the 3.4\u03bcm feature observed in the\ndiffuse ISM towards the Galactic center source, IRS6E, and in the protoplanetary nebula,\nCRL618. In Figures 5 and 6, the 3.4\u03bcm feature in NGC1068 is compared with that of the\nten other galaxies in which the feature has been clearly detected to date4 .\nProbably the most striking aspect of Fig. 4 is the close resemblance that the 3.4\u03bcm feature in NGC1068 bears to that observed in the Galactic lines of sight. The 3.4\u03bcm absorption\nin this Seyfert 2 nucleus clearly exhibits the same subpeaks that are observed in the feature\nin the Galactic diffuse ISM and the protoplanetary nebula: the 3.38\u03bcm CH3 asymmetric\nstretch, 3.42\u03bcm CH2 asymmetric stretch and 3.48\u03bcm CH3 symmetric stretch. As in the\nother spectra, the 3.50\u03bcm CH2 symmetric stretch band is not clearly present, an observation\ninterpreted by Sandford et al. (1991) as the possible effect of electron-withdrawing groups\n4\n\nThe 3.4\u03bcm absorption has also been seen in a twelfth galaxy, NGC5506 (Imanishi 2000a). However,\nthe weakness of the feature in that galaxy (\u03c43.4 \u2264 0.025) means that its detection, depth and profile are\ncritically dependent on the choice of baseline against which \u03c43.4 is measured. Atmospheric absorption lines\nat the short end of the spectrum, which do not cancel out well in this dataset, make it impossible to\nunambiguously determine this baseline, so we do not consider NGC5506 any further.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n\nFig. 1.- (a) UKIRT/UIST flux spectrum of NGC1068 (R 600), showing the continuum used\nto derive the optical depth spectrum.

The spectra of\nIRS6E and CRL618 have been normalized to NGC1068 at \u03c43.42 , and lines of collisionallyexcited H2 indicated on the spectrum of CRL618. The errors in the spectrum of NGC1068\nare approximately the same as the observed point-to-point scatter, except in the regions of\npoor atmospheric cancellation shortwards of approx. 3.42\u03bcm, where systematic cancellation\neffects dominate.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nattached to the hydrocarbon chains which give rise to the feature (see \u00a76.1). Not only are the\npeak wavelengths good matches, but the relative strengths of the subfeatures are also very\nsimilar between NGC1068 and the other objects. This indicates that the relative numbers of\nCH3 and CH2 groups, and therefore the average lengths of the hydrocarbon chains, are very\nsimilar in all the lines of sight. The new NGC1068 data confirm in more detail the findings\nof Wright et al. (1996) and Imanishi et al. (1997).\nBesides the Galactic diffuse ISM and CRL618, the 3.4\u03bcm feature in NGC1068 is very\nmuch like the feature in IRAS08572 and IRAS19254 (Fig. 5). Hydrocarbons in IRAS08572,\nin particular, produce a 3.4\u03bcm band which is virtually identical to that caused by hydrocarbons in the nuclear region of NGC1068. Some small differences appear in the spectrum\nof IRAS19254. The feature in this ULIRG exhibits the same subfeatures and general shape,\nbut, in the binned spectrum presented by Risaliti et al. (2003), the peak around 3.48\u03bcm\nis slightly stronger than that in NGC1068 and the Galactic center. In our new reduction\nof these data this difference is less noticeable, but the 3.38\u03bcm CH3 asymmetric stretch is\na little more prominent than in the other lines of sight. Overall, though, the feature bears\nquite a close resemblance to that in all of the other lines of sight examined so far.\nAlthough at much lower S/N, about half of the remaining galaxies show a similar pattern\nof a peak near 3.42\u03bcm accompanied by a shoulder around 3.48\u03bcm, in roughly the same proportions as in NGC1068 and the Galactic sightlines (Fig. 6). Interestingly, the remainder of\nthe sample hints at differences. In particular, the ratio \u03c43.42 /\u03c43.48 may be lower in UGC5101,\nNGC7479 and IRAS05189 than in NGC1068. However, in the absence of higher-S/N data\non the 3.4\u03bcm feature in these galaxies, further speculation seems premature.\n\n5.\n\nThe nuclear mid-IR spectrum of\nNGC1068\n\nAs dust absorption features in the mid-IR have been shown to be a powerful tool for\ndiscriminating between models for dust composition and evolution (Pendleton & Allamandola 2002), it would be instructive to compare 5-9\u03bcm spectra of these galaxies with each\nother and with the laboratory data. To date, such a comparison has been attempted for only\none line of sight, towards Sgr A* in the Galactic center (Chiar et al. 2000; Pendleton &\nAllamandola 2002). The mid-IR spectrum of the diffuse interstellar dust in that line of sight\nis remarkably sparse, the only features being the asymmetric and symmetric bending modes\nof C H bonds, at 6.85 and 7.25\u03bcm respectively. In this regard the spectrum of Sgr A*\nis similar to the spectra of plasma-processed carbon materials (representing dust formed in\nstellar outflows), but very different from the more complex spectra of processed ice residues\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n\nFig. 5.- The 3.4\u03bcm feature in NGC1068 compared with that in (a) IRAS08572 and (b)\nIRAS19254 (Risaliti et al. 2003). In each case, NGC1068 is the solid black line and has been\nmultiplied by a constant in order to have the same optical depth as the comparison galaxy\naround 3.42\u03bcm.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\n\nFig. 6.- The 3.4\u03bcm feature in NGC1068 (filled circles) compared with that in several other\nSeyfert 2 galaxies and ULIRGs, displayed in order of increasing \u03c43.4 . The spectra are shown\nbinned to a common resolution of \u223c120, error bars for NGC1068 are smaller than the data\npoints. References for the data shown in this figure can be found in Table 1.\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nand the Murchison meteorite spectrum of de Vries et al. (1993), which display additional\nfeatures due to functional groups such as NH, CO and OH. All of these classes of material\ncan exhibit a 3.4\u03bcm feature which is a close match to the diffuse ISM data, yet they vary\ngreatly at longer wavelengths.\nOf the galaxies with the best-quality L-band spectra, no mid-IR data yet exist for\nIRAS08572. PAH emission bands complicate the interpretation of the MIR spectrum of\nIRAS19254 (Charmandaris et al. 2002). An ISOCAM CVF 5-16\u03bcm spectrum of the central\n700pc (\u224810\u2032\u2032 , \u03bb/\u2206\u03bb \u223c 30 \u2212 40) of NGC1068 has been published by Le Floc'h et al. (2001),\nwhile at higher spectral resolution (\u03bb/\u2206\u03bb \u223c 1200), ISO-SWS has covered the full 2-45\u03bcm\nrange (Lutz et al. 2000; Sturm et al. 2000). The aperture through which the ISO-SWS\nspectrum was observed covers 14\u2032\u2032 \u00d720\u2032\u2032 at wavelengths shorter than 12\u03bcm, large enough to\ninclude some flux from the kiloparsec-scale region of star formation in NGC1068. However,\nthe weakness of the PAH emission bands in this spectrum and their similarity to those in the\nsmaller-aperture ISOCAM-CVF spectrum suggests that the ISO-SWS data are dominated\nby the region of dust close to the nucleus towards which we measured the 3.4\u03bcm feature. We\ntherefore use this spectrum to assess whether the similarity of the 3.4\u03bcm feature in NGC1068\nto that observed in the Galactic diffuse ISM is accompanied by a mid-IR spectrum also\nresembling that of the Galactic diffuse ISM.\nTo establish the presence or absence of mid-IR absorption features in NGC1068, the\nspectra were fitted with polynomial curves, with wavelengths < 7.5\u03bcm and > 7.5\u03bcm treated\nseparately (Fig. 7). The broad emission structure between approximately 7.5 and 9\u03bcm is\na blend of two weak PAH bands (Sturm et al. 2000) and any hydrocarbon absorption\nfeatures would be expected to be seen superimposed on this, so no attempt was made to find\nthe underlying continuum in this region. As with the 3.4\u03bcm feature, the fitted curves were\nused as baselines against which the optical depth of any absorption features in the spectrum\ncould be measured. We measure \u03c43.4 \u2248 0.07 for the ISO-SWS spectrum of NGC1068. The\nsmaller value of \u03c43.4 in this spectrum than in Fig. 1 is likely to be due to the large ISO beam\nencompassing some less deeply obscured material than the smaller UIST aperture.\nAlso shown in Fig. 7 is a comparison of the NGC1068 ISO spectra with optical depth\nspectra of the line of sight towards Sgr A* in the Galactic center, the Murchison meteorite,\nand two laboratory materials which have been proposed as analogs of the hydrocarbon component of dust (Allamandola, Sandford & Valero 1988; de Vries et al. 1993; Mennella et\nal. 1999; Chiar et al. 2000). These particular laboratory substances, a hydrogenated\namorphous carbon (HAC) and the residue from a UV-irradiated ice, were chosen because,\nwhile they both have absorption at 3.4\u03bcm, they have very different 5-9\u03bcm spectra (Pendleton & Allamandola 2002). The HAC sample produces some absorption below 3\u03bcm and\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nbetween the 3.4\u03bcm feature and the 5-9\u03bcm features, but such featureless absorption would\nbe indistinguishable from the continuum level in the NGC1068 spectrum. This absorption\nwas therefore subtracted from the HAC spectrum. All the comparison spectra have been\nmultiplied by a constant in order to be normalized to \u03c43.4 = 0.07.\nThe detailed similarity of NGC1068 and Sgr A* is difficult to ascertain. It is apparent\nfrom Fig. 7 that if dust resembling that in the Galactic diffuse ISM is present in the nucleus of\nNGC1068, we should not expect to be able to detect and compare the 6.85 and 7.25\u03bcm C H\nbends which accompany the 3.4\u03bcm band. The weakness of these features in the Galactic\ncenter spectrum, approximately 0.24 and 0.14 times the depth of the 3.4\u03bcm feature in that\nline of sight (Chiar et al. 2000), would make them undetectable in the spectra of NGC1068.\nThe same is true for the laboratory spectrum of the HAC (Mennella et al. 1999). This\nleaves open the possibility that weak bands exist in NGC1068 which are not observed in\nthe Galactic center. On the other hand, Fig. 7 suggests that if the strong bands arising in\nthe spectra of the ice residue (Allamandola et al. 1988) and the meteorite (de Vries et al.\n1993) were present in the NGC1068 data, they would be clearly visible. As with the 3.4\u03bcm\nfeature, the dust in NGC1068 could have had a very different 5-9\u03bcm spectrum from that of\nGalactic dust, but large differences are not observed.\n\n6.\n6.1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nInterpreting small changes in the profile of the 3.4\u03bcm feature\n\nIn \u00a74, it was noted that the 3.4\u03bcm feature in IRAS19254, while overall a good match to\nthat observed in other lines of sight, may show some small differences in the relative depths\nof the subpeaks within the feature. Risaliti et al. (2003) suggest that the higher depth\nof the 3.48\u03bcm subfeature in their spectrum of IRAS19254 may be attributed to increased\nnumbers of electronegative groups in the grains. In pure saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons\n(compounds with the general formula Cn H2n+2 , e.g. propane, butane), four subpeaks are\nvisible within the 3.4\u03bcm feature, rather than the three which can be seen in the astronomical\nspectra. The four peaks are caused by symmetric and asymmetric stretches of CH2 and CH3\ngroups. As the symmetric stretch features lie closer together than the asymmetric stretch\nbands, shifts in band frequencies caused by nearby electron-withdrawing groups are more\nlikely to cause blending of the symmetric stretch features. This effect could account for\nthe apparent disappearance of the 3.50\u03bcm CH2 symmetric stretch band in the astronomical\nspectra, which may in fact simply have been shifted to a position coincident with the 3.48\u03bcm\nCH3 subfeature (Sandford et al. 1991).\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n\nFig. 7.- (a) ISO-SWS spectrum of NGC1068 (Lutz et al. 2000; Sturm et al. 2000) showing\nthe baseline used to derive an optical depth spectrum. (b) Mid-IR optical depth spectrum of\nNGC1068 compared with other lines of sight and dust analog materials. In increasing order\nof optical depth at 7\u03bcm: Sgr A* (Chiar et al. 2000); HAC (Mennella et al. 1999); processed\nice residue (Allamandola et al. 1988); Murchison meteorite (de Vries et al. 1993).\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nTherefore it is plausible that an increase in the number of electronegative groups could\nshift the CH2 symmetric stretch band further under the CH3 symmetric stretch band,\nmarginally enhancing the depth of the CH3 subfeature at 3.48\u03bcm. Alternatively, given the\nslight increase in the strength of the CH3 asymmetric stretch band at 3.38\u03bcm in IRAS19254,\nwe could be observing a decrease in the typical length of the hydrocarbon chains in the dust.\nOr, conversely, an increase in the length of the chains could be supressing the symmetric\nstretch features with respect to the asymmetric stretching bands (Cernicharo et al. 2001).\nIn fact, while overall trends in the shape of this feature are governed by factors such as chain\nlength and the presence of elements other than C and H in the chains, these factors act\ntogether in a very complex manner to influence the details of the feature profile. Although\nvariations in the shape of the 3.4\u03bcm feature undoubtedly reflect the chemical composition\nof the material which gives rise to it, it is difficult to ascribe small changes in the 3.4\u03bcm\nfeature in complex mixtures of hydrocarbons to particular, specific chemical changes with\nmuch confidence.\n\n6.2.\n\nThe chemical makeup of the carbonaceous dust in other galaxies\n\nIt is clear that, certainly in the galaxies with the best data - NGC1068, IRAS08572\nand IRAS19254 - the 3.4\u03bcm feature varies only slightly from galaxy to galaxy and is very\nsimilar to that observed in Galactic lines of sight. In addition, about half of the other galaxies\nwith lower-S/N detections of the 3.4\u03bcm band have features with profiles consistent with that\nof NGC1068.\nOne explanation for the similarity of the 3.4\u03bcm feature in several different galaxies may\nbe that the spectra of different hydrocarbon-containing substances are simply averaging\nout to the observed spectrum. This may well be the case for small variations in the band\nprofile, but it is less plausible that large, systematic differences in the 3.4\u03bcm band in different\nenvironments could be masked in this way. If, for instance, dust in IRAS08572 generally\ncontained a much higher fraction of longer hydrocarbon chains than dust in NGC1068, this\nwould be expected to enhance the subpeaks corresponding to CH2 groups. That some of\nthe galaxies in this sample do appear to show differences in the band profile, as do complex\nlaboratory mixtures of hydrocarbons, supports this view. It appears that, whatever other\ndifferences there may be in the dust in other galaxies, the hydrocarbon fraction bears a close\nresemblance to that which we observe in Galactic lines of sight.\nWhile the 3.4\u03bcm feature relates directly only to the saturated hydrocarbon chains, the\nsimilarity of the band in several different lines of sight may actually reflect overall compositional similarity in the dust. Based on fits to the 3.4\u03bcm feature, a number of analog\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nmaterials produced by different mechanisms have been suggested to represent the carbonaceous component of dust. Pendleton et al. (1994) show that certain processed carbon-rich\nice residues can produce about as good a match to the interstellar 3.4\u03bcm feature as those\nproduced from carbon plasmas, for example. Only inconsistencies with observations in the\n5-9\u03bcm region rule out processed ices as good analogs of interstellar dust (Pendleton & Allamandola 2002). This means that the 3.4\u03bcm absorption alone is not the ideal tool with\nwhich to probe dust composition and evolution. On the other hand, there also exist plenty\nof dust candidate materials with 3.4\u03bcm bands which clearly differ from each other and from\nthe astronomical spectra. This is illustrated in Fig. 8, which compares the 3.4\u03bcm band in\nthree different hydrocarbon-containing substances. Band profiles as varied as these would\nbe easily distinguishable in spectra with the S/N and resolution as those of at least three of\nthe galaxies for which L-band data exist.\nIf the dust in NGC1068, IRAS08572 and IRAS19254 were formed by a completely different mechanism from Galactic dust and/or underwent different processing, then it is certainly\npossible that this would be apparent from the profile of the 3.4\u03bcm feature. Instead we observe that the bands in these galaxies are as good a match to each other and to Galactic\nspectra as are any laboratory spectra. Rather than different processes which coincidentally\nproduce materials with almost identical features, the similarity of the feature in these extragalactic lines of sight suggests similar dust formation and/or processing mechanisms to those\nresponsible for the feature in the Galactic diffuse ISM. The mid-IR spectrum of NGC1068,\nwhich, like that of the Galactic center, shows no indication of the deep absorption features\nproduced by many materials proposed as analogs of carbonaceous dust, supports this interpretation. The mismatch between a dust analog material, the Murchison meteorite and\nNGC1068 emphasizes that, even though materials which bear a close resemblance at 3.4\u03bcm\ncan have very different mid-IR spectra, gross differences are not observed between the Galactic diffuse ISM and nuclear dust in NGC1068. This supports the suggestion that the nuclear\ncarbon-containing dust in NGC1068 is genuinely chemically similar to that in the Galactic\ndiffuse ISM. Further mid-IR studies of other galaxies, notably IRAS08572, will be invaluable\nin determining the full extent of this similarity.\n\n6.3.\n\nDust production and survival in galaxies\n\nThat the dust in some Seyfert galaxies and ULIRGs appears to resemble that towards the\nGalactic center and in CRL618 is intriguing. Can this uniformity reveal anything about the\nspecific production mechanism of the hydrocarbon solids, the sensitivity of this mechanism\nto environmental conditions, or the chemical and physical conditions of the regions in which\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nthe carrier of the 3.4\u03bcm band is formed?\nThe debate over the origins of the carbonaceous fraction of interstellar dust centers\naround two main formation mechanisms: photochemical reactions in the icy grain mantles\nfound in molecular clouds, and condensation in stellar outflows followed by competing processes of dehydrogenation and reformation of C H bonds in the diffuse ISM (e.g. Li &\nGreenberg 1997; Chiar et al. 1998; Mennella et al. 2003). Laboratory experiments show\nthat irradiation of carbon-rich ice mixtures can indeed give rise to material which absorbs at\n3.4\u03bcm, but the profile of the band is sensitive to the composition of the initial ice mixture.\nThis contrasts with the very uniform behavior of the astronomical 3.4\u03bcm band both in the\ngalaxies examined here and in Galactic lines of sight. Laboratory analogs of dust produced\nin stellar outflows involve processes such as exposing amorphous carbon grains or graphite to\nhydrogen, or passing an electric or microwave-powered discharge through gaseous methane or\nother hydrocarbon compound (see Pendleton & Allamandola 2002, and references therein,\nfor examples). While there is some variation in the 3.4\u03bcm band in the resulting materials, in\nall cases but that of the CH4 plasma/microwave discharge, this is not very pronounced. However, in experiments mimicing dust formation in carbon-rich circumstellar shells, Grishko &\nDuley (2002) have shown that the 3.4\u03bcm feature profile is influenced by the presence of\nelements other than C and H. NH3 and N2 cause the individual CH2 and CH3 subpeaks\nto become less distinct, whereas O2 causes absorption to be replaced by scattering-induced\nemission. The sensitivity of the 3.4\u03bcm band profile to environmental conditions in both of\nthese formation scenarios, in contrast with the lack of variation in the feature now observed\nin a number of galaxies, suggests that the conditions necessary for the formation of the band\ncarrier are common and quite invariant in evolved stars and the diffuse ISM in a range of\ngalaxies.\nIt is also possible that further processing of the dust grains after their formation induces\na degree of uniformity in their composition and in the profile of the 3.4\u03bcm band. Greenberg et\nal. (1995) present spectra of ice residues exposed to the solar radiation field for four months\naboard the EURECA satellite and point out the very good resemblance borne by the 3.4\u03bcm\nfeature in these samples to that of the Galactic diffuse ISM. The samples were synthesized\nfrom initial ice mixtures of somewhat different compositions, and irradiated in the laboratory\nbefore further irradiation in space. This raises the possibility that prolonged UV exposure\ncould cause initially varied 3.4\u03bcm bands to converge on the observed, astronomical profile.\nHowever, in no case was the spectrum prior to solar irradiation recorded, and the spectra of\n13 other samples which also flew were not presented, so this hypothesis currently remains\nuntested. As for dust produced in circumstellar shells, Grishko & Duley (2002) find that the\ndifferences in the 3.4\u03bcm band formed in the presence of O and N often disappear when the\ndust is heated to 500\u25e6C. If aliphatic hydrocarbons are synthesized in regions of circumstellar\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nenvelopes which attain this temperature, this could naturally explain the lack of variation in\nthe resulting 3.4\u03bcm feature. Observationally, the 3.4\u03bcm band has only been detected so far\nin one PPNe (CRL618; Lequeux & Jourdain de Muizon 1990; Chiar et al. 1998); detection\nin a range of evolved stars, with information on physical and chemical conditions, could show\nwhether the feature profile is insensitive to the conditions under which it forms, or whether\nthe necessary conditions are in fact widespread.\nAs both the ice photolysis and stellar outflow routes to dust production are capable of\nproducing a 3.4\u03bcm band which matches the observations quite well, that feature alone cannot\nbe used to distinguish decisively between these two mechanisms. However, as discussed in\n\u00a75 and \u00a76.2, the mid-IR spectrum of NGC1068, like that of Sgr A*, shows none of the strong\nmid-IR bands which appear in spectra of photolysed ices. This means that none of the ice\nresidues currently proposed as analogs of carbonaceous dust is really a viable candidate. The\nfour months' irradiation of the Greenberg et al. (1995) samples is roughly equivalent to one\npassage of a dust grain through the diffuse ISM before re-entering a molecular cloud, and a\ntypical grain will experience many such episodes during its 109 yr lifetime. Greenberg et al.\n(1995) predict that further UV exposure will remove O, N and H atoms, thus weakening the\ntroublesome mid-IR spectral features. Each time the grain enters a molecular cloud, though,\nit will acquire a new ice coating containing precisely these atoms, so it is not obvious that\nthe mid-IR bands will be diminished sufficiently to match the observations. The weight of\nevidence concerning Galactic hydrocarbon-containing dust now tends to support an origin\nin circumstellar environments and the diffuse ISM (Chiar et al. 1998; Adamson et al. 1999;\nPendleton & Allamandola 2002; Mennella et al. 2003; Shenoy et al. 2003), and the mid-IR\nspectrum of NGC1068 supports this view.\nThat the 3.4\u03bcm absorption has been detected in ULIRGs and Seyfert galaxies clearly\nmeans that the band carrier is capable of surviving in these galaxies. ULIRGS are characterized by energy densities 3-4 orders of magnitude greater than those in the solar neighborhood\n(Maloney 1999). Interestingly, Heckman & Lehnert (2000) find that certain properties of the\ndiffuse interstellar bands in starburst galaxies are similar to those in Galactic lines of sight.\nDespite very high rates of energy deposition into the ISM, the ratios of the strengths of the\nbands and their correlation with reddening are roughly the same in the starbursts as in the\nGalactic diffuse ISM. The authors speculate that this is because, while the energy densities\nin these galaxies are large, the ISM pressure is increased by a corresponding amount. Maloney (1999) calculates that, like the energy densities, the pressure in the ISM of ULIRGs\nis also 3-4 orders of magnitude greater than the ISM pressure in the solar neighborhood,\nand that this, coupled with a large shielding column of dust, can be sufficient to protect\neven the fragile PAHs from X-ray destruction in AGN-powered ULIRGs. In IRAS08572 and\nIRAS19254, where the 3.4\u03bcm band bears a good resemblance to that in the Galactic diffuse\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\nISM, NH \u2265 1025 cm\u22122 (Table 1), presumably providing a great deal of shielding.\nAs discussed in \u00a72.1, the 3.4\u03bcm feature in face-on Seyfert 2 galaxies is likely to arise\nin dust local to the active nucleus. The exotic chemistry of the circumnuclear clouds in\nNGC1068 shows signs of being influenced by the X-ray flux from the central engine (Sternberg, Genzel & Tacconi 1994; Usero et al. 2003), so it is reasonable to ask whether X-ray\nemission in AGN might also influence the hydrocarbon dust. Given that the 3.4\u03bcm feature\nis observed in absorption, however, the environment in which the carbonaceous dust exists\nmay not be as harsh as might be expected. The nuclei of NGC1068 and NGC7674 are obscured at both hard and soft X-ray energies (see Table 1), and H2 emission is concentrated\non either side of the nuclear IR flux peak in NGC1068 (Galliano & Alloin 2002; Gratadour\net al. 2003). These observations suggest that the absorbing dust is exposed to neither\nX-rays nor UV photons, which would be attenuated by the large (NH > 1025 cm\u22122 ) column\nof warmer dust between it and the nucleus. Similarly, the absence of 3.3\u03bcm PAH emission\nin the smallest-aperture L-band spectra of NGC1068 could reflect not destruction of the\nmolecules in a harsh environment, but simply lack of an excitation mechanism. In some of\nthe other Seyfert galaxies the shielding column is considerably smaller than in NGC1068 and\nNGC7674. These galaxies are closer to edge-on, meaning that some of the dust in the line\nof sight may be far from the nucleus. As the scale heights of dust in spiral galaxies tend to\nbe small (Alton et al. 2000), though, these spectra are likely to still contain a substantial\ncontribution from nuclear dust. This suggests that the hydrocarbons in the dust in these\ngalaxies are robust enough to survive unchanged in quite harsh conditions.\n\n7.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have shown that the 3.4\u03bcm C H bond stretch of interstellar dust in the Seyfert\ngalaxy, NGC1068, and two ULIRGs, IRAS08572 and IRAS19254, has a very similar profile\nto that seen in Galactic carbonaceous material. Of the other galaxies in which the 3.4\u03bcm\nfeature has been detected at much lower S/N, several also have feature profiles consistent\nwith that of NGC1068. Although minor differences are seen between IRAS19254 and other\nobjects, these differences are small compared with the variations that are capable of occurring in hydrocarbon chains of varying lengths and in differing chemical environments. This\nimplies that the hydrocarbon portion of the carbonaceous dust in these galaxies bears a close\nresemblance to that which exists in our own Galaxy, probably as a result of the dust having\na similar formation and processing history to that in the Galactic diffuse ISM. Examination\nof the mid-IR spectrum of NGC1068 reveals none of the strong absorption bands characteristic of many materials proposed as analogs of carbonaceous dust. Although features like\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\nthose present in the mid-IR spectrum of the Galactic center would be undetectable in the\navailable data for NGC1068, the lack of major differences is consistent with the suggestion\nthat the dust in this AGN is chemically very similar to dust in the Galactic diffuse ISM. It\nalso suggests that condensation in circumstellar environments, rather than processing of icy\ngrain mantles, is the dominant source of carbonaceous dust in many galaxies. Higher S/N\nspectroscopy at 3.4 and 5-9\u03bcm, particularly of the galaxies whose lower S/N spectra hint at\ndifferent feature profiles, will prove invaluable in assessing whether this remarkable chemical\nsimilarity is a common feature of active, ultraluminous and quiescent galaxies alike.\nWe thank the anonymous referee for a prompt and constructive report.
