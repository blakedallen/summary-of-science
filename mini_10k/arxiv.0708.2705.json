We extend the notion of algebraic stack to an arbitrary subcanonical site C. If the topology on C is local on the target and satisfies descent\nfor morphisms, we show that algebraic stacks are precisely those which are\nweakly equivalent to representable presheaves of groupoids whose domain map\nis a cover. This leads naturally to a definition of algebraic n-stacks. We also\ncompare different sites naturally associated to a stack.\n\n1. Introduction\nStacks arise naturally in the study of moduli problems in geometry. They were\nintroduced by Giraud [Gi] and Grothendieck, and were used by Deligne and Mumford [DM] to study the the moduli spaces of curves. They have recently become\nimportant also in differential geometry [Bry] and homotopy theory [G]. Higher\norder generalizations of stacks are also receiving much attention from algebraic\ngeometers and homotopy theorists.\nIn this paper, we continue the study of stacks from the point of view of homotopy\ntheory started in [H, H2]. The aim of these papers is to show that many properties\nof stacks and classical constructions with stacks are homotopy theoretic in nature.\nThis homotopy theoretical understanding gives rise to a simpler and more powerful\ngeneral theory. In [H] we introduced model category structures on different ambient categories in which stacks are the fibrant objects, and showed that they are\nall Quillen equivalent. In this paper we work with the simplest such model: the\nlocal model structure on presheaves of groupoids on site C, which we denote by\nP (C, Grpd)L .\nDeligne and Mumford introduced the notion of an algebraic stack in [DM, Definition 4.6]. This definition generalizes easily to an arbitrary site C and our main\nresult is a characterization of these (generalized) algebraic stacks on sites satisfying\ncertain mild hypotheses.\nA key observation is that the (2-category) fiber product (see Definition 2.1) is a\nmodel for the homotopy pullback in the model category P (C, Grpd)L and this allows\nus to rewrite the definition of representable morphism in the following homotopy\ninvariant fashion:\nf : M \u2192 N \u2208 P (C, Grpd)\nis representable if for each X \u2192 N with X \u2208 C, the homotopy pullback M \u00d7hN X is\nweakly equivalent to a representable.\nReceived by the editors April, 25, 2006.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 55U10 ; Secondary 18G55, 14A20 .\nc 1997 American Mathematical Society\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nSHARON HOLLANDER\n\nGeneralizing [DM, Definition 4.4], we say that a presheaf of groupoids M on C is\nalgebraic if the diagonal M \u2192 M \u00d7 M is a representable morphism and there exists\na cover X \u2192 M with X \u2208 C. By cover we mean a representable morphism such\nthat for all Y \u2208 C, the homotopy pullback\nX \u00d7hM Y \u2192 Y\nis weakly equivalent to a cover in C.\nWe say that the (basis for the) topology on C is local if the notion of cover is\nlocal on the target (Definition 4.2). This condition is satisfied by virtually all the\ntopologies in use in algebraic geometry and one can always saturate a basis for a\ntopology so that this condition is satisfied. A topology on C satisfies descent for\nmorphisms if the contravariant assignment X 7\u2192 Iso(C/X) is a stack (Definition\n4.1). Our main result is then the following.\nTheorem 1.1 (Theorem 4.3). Let C be a Grothendieck topology which is local on\nthe target and satisfies descent for morphisms. M \u2208 P (C, Grpd) is algebraic if\nand only if M is weakly equivalent in P (C, Grpd)L to a representable presheaf of\ngroupoids (Xo , Xm ) with the domain map Xm \u2192 Xo a cover in C.\nIn particular, if C = Aff f lat (fpqc for affine schemes), this theorem characterizes\nalgebraic stacks as those weakly equivalent to flat Hopf algebroids.\nThis result leads naturally to a definition of algebraic \u221e-stacks (n-stacks);\nthey are those presheaves of simplicial sets on C which are weakly equivalent in\nP (C, sSet)L (see [DHI]) to (the n-coskeleton of) a simplicial object in C where all\nthe boundary maps are covers.\nIn the appendix we consider several natural sites associated to a stack and compare them. The first is the classical site C/M (see [DM]). In this topology, the\nobjects are maps X \u2192 M with X \u2208 C. It is natural to ask for a topology on the\nover category of M (in which M itself is an object). We use the notion of representability to construct a larger site Rep/M and prove that for M algebraic the\nsheaves on the two sites agree.\nWe also construct a topology on P (C, Grpd)/M where the covers are collections\nof fibrations Ui \u2192 M such that the canonical map from the realization of the nerve\n|U\u2022 | \u2192 M is a weak equivalence. We characterize these covers as those sets of maps\nwhose image is locally a covering sieve for the topology on C (see Proposition A.9).\n1.1. Relation to other work. In his 2004 Northwestern thesis E. Pribble [P]\nconstructs an equivalence of 2-categories between flat Hopf algebroids and rigidified\nalgebraic stacks. This is essentially equivalent to Theorem 4.3 in case C is affine\nschemes in the flat topology.\n1.2. Acknowledgments. I would like to thank G. Granja for helpful comments.\n1.3. Notation and conventions. We assume that our fixed base site C is small\nand closed under finite products and pullbacks. By topology we mean what is\nusually called a basis for a topology [MM, Definition III.2.2]. We assume the\ntopology is subcanonical, i.e. that the representable functors are sheaves, and\nidentify the objects in C with the sheaves they represent.\nWe write P (C, Grpd) for the\n` category of presheaves of groupoids on C. If {Ui \u2192\nX} is a cover, we write U = i Ui for the coproduct of the sheaves and U\u2022 for the\nnerve of the cover which is the simplicial object obtained by taking iterated fiber\n\n\fCHARACTERIZING ALGEBRAIC STACKS\n\n3\n\nproducts over X. We will sometimes abuse notation and write a cover as U \u2192 X.\n|U\u2022 | will denote the geometric realization of the simplicial object in P (C, Grpd).\nRecall that the geometric realization of a simplicial diagram F\u2022 in P (C, Grpd) is\ndefined by |F\u2022 |(X) = |F\u2022 (X)| (see [H, Section 2.2]).\nWe will write P (C, Grpd) for the category of presheaves of groupoids with the\nlevelwise model structure where a map F \u2192 F \u2032 is a fibration (weak equivalence) if\nand only if F (X) \u2192 F \u2032 (X) is a fibration (weak equivalence) in Grpd for all X \u2208 C.\nWe will write P (C, Grpd)L for the local model structure which is the localization of\nP (C, Grpd) with respect to the maps |U\u2022 | \u2192 X where U \u2192 X is a cover (see [H]).\nThe local model structure P (C, Grpd)L is our default.\nWe will use repeatedly the basic result [H, Theorem 5.7] which characterizes the\nweak equivalences in P (C, Grpd)L as those satisfying the local lifting conditions.\nDefinition 1.2.

Fiber Product\nIn this section we will review the fiber product of stacks [LM-B, Definition 2.2.2]\nfrom our homotopy theoretic point of view.\nDefinition 2.1. Let\n\ni\n\nj\n\n\u2192N\u2190\n\u2212 M2\nM1 \u2212\nbe a diagram in P (C, Grpd). The homotopy fiber product M1 \u00d7hN M2 , is the presheaf\nof groupoids defined as follows:\n(1) the objects of (M1 \u00d7hN M2 )(X) are triples (a, b, \u03c6) with a \u2208 M1 (X), b \u2208\n\u223c\nM2 (X) and an isomorphism \u03c6 : i(a) \u2212\u2192 j(b), and\n(2) morphisms of (M1 \u00d7hN M2 )(X) from (a, b, \u03c6) to (a\u2032 , b\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 ) are pairs (\u03b1, \u03b2)\nwhere \u03b1 : a \u223c\n= a\u2032 and \u03b2 : b \u223c\n= b\u2032 , such that \u03c6\u2032 \u25e6 i(\u03b1) = j(\u03b2) \u25e6 \u03c6.\nThere are natural projections pi : M1 \u00d7hN M2 \u2192 Mi and natural homotopy\ni \u25e6 p1 \u2192 j \u25e6 p2 which are universal in the following sense. To give a map f : M \u2192\nM1 \u00d7hN M2 is the same as to give a maps fi : M \u2192 Mi and a levelwise homotopy\ni \u25e6 f1 \u2192 j \u25e6 f2 .\nThe homotopy fiber product defined above is obviously the homotopy limit of the\npullback diagram in the category P (C, Grpd) with the levelwise model structure. In\n\n\f4\n\nSHARON HOLLANDER\n\nfact, it also provides a model for the homotopy pullback in the local model structure\nas we now see.\nLemma 2.2. The homotopy fiber product of Definition 2.1 is a model for the homotopy pullback in P (C, Grpd)L .\nProof. Consider the pullback diagram in Definition 2.1. Since P (C, Grpd)L is right\nproper [H, Corollary 5.8] (and P (C, Grpd) is obviously right proper), the homotopy\nfiber product in both of these model categories is obtained by replacing the map\nM2 \u2192 N by a fibration and taking the pullback.\n\u223c\nFactor M2 \u2192 N into a trivial cofibration followed by a fibration M2 \u2212\u2192 M\u2032 \u0589 N\n\u223c\n\u2032\nin P (C, Grpd)L . Further factor M2 \u2212\u2192 M into a levelwise trivial cofibration and a\n\u223c\nlevelwise fibration M2 \u2212\u2192 M\u2032\u2032 \u0589 M\u2032 . Then we have a levelwise weak equivalence\nM1 \u00d7hN M2 \u2243 M1 \u00d7N M\u2032\u2032 .\nThe map M1 \u00d7N M\u2032\u2032 \u2192 M1 \u00d7N M\u2032 is the pullback of a levelwise fibration and weak\nequivalence and hence, by [H, Corollary 5.8], it is itself a weak equivalence.\n\u0003\nRemark 2.3. Since homotopy limits commute with each other, if M1 , M2 and N\nin Definition 2.1 are stacks, (presheaves of groupoids satisfying the homotopy sheaf\ncondition, see [H, Definition 1.3]) the homotopy fiber product M1 \u00d7hN M2 is also\na stack and agrees with what is usually called the fiber product of stacks [LM-B,\n2.2.2].\nGiven a groupoid object (X0 , X1 ) in C we abuse notation and let (X0 , X1 ) denote\nthe presheaf of groupoids of which X0 represents the objects and Xm represents\nthe morphisms. We let M(X0 ,X1 ) denote the fibrant replacement in P (C, Grpd)L of\n(X0 , X1 ), that is its stackification.\nLemma 2.4. Let M be a presheaf of groupoids, (X0 , X1 ) be a groupoid object in C,\nand (X0 , X1 ) \u2192 M a weak equivalence in P (C, Grpd)L . The map\nX1\n\n/ X0 \u00d7 h X0\nM\n\ninduced by the domain and range is a weak equivalence. If M is a stack, it is a\nlevelwise weak equivalence.\nProof. First we prove that the map is a weak equivalence for M = M(X0 ,X1 ) . By\nLemma 2.2, we need to verify the local lifting conditions of Definition 1.2 for the\nmap X1 \u2192 X0 \u00d7hM X0 . By definition the map (X0 , X1 ) \u2192 M is a weak equivalence\nand so by 1.2(2) given two objects a, b \u2208 X0 (Y ) and an isomorphism between their\nimages in M(Y ) there exists a cover U \u2192 Y \u2208 C such that this isomorphism lifts\nto X1 (U ). This implies that condition 1.2(1) holds for the map X1 \u2192 X0 \u00d7hM X0 .\nSimilarly, given \u03c61 , \u03c62 \u2208 X1 (X), an isomorphism between their images in (X0 \u00d7hM\nX0 )(X) is necessarily trivial (as X0 (X) is discrete) and so the images of \u03c61 and \u03c62\nin M(X) are the same.\nThe fact that (X0 , X1 ) \u2192 M satisfies condition 1.2(2) for the cofibration BZ \u2192 \u2217\nguarantees the existence of the cover U of X such that \u03c61 and \u03c62 in X1 (U ). This\nproves one half of 1.2(2) for the map X1 \u2192 X0 \u00d7hM X0 and the other half is automatic\nas X1 (X) is discrete.\nFor general M, the fact that the map is a weak equivalence follows from the\nhomotopy invariance of the homotopy fiber product (Lemma 2.2).\n\n\fCHARACTERIZING ALGEBRAIC STACKS\n\n5\n\nSince weak equivalences between fibrant objects in P (C, Grpd)L are levelwise\nweak equivalences, if M is a stack, the map is a levelwise weak equivalence.\n\u0003\nRemark 2.5. If M is a stack, the statement that X1 \u2192 X0 \u00d7hM X0 is a levelwise\nweak equivalence means that evaluating at each X \u2208 C\n(X0 , X1 )(X) \u2192 M(X)\nis bijective on Hom sets and that two objects with the same image in M(X) are\nalready isomorphic on (X0 , X1 )(X). Thus this map is equivalent to the inclusion\nof a full subcategory of M(X) for each X \u2208 C.\nIf M is not a stack, composing the map with a fibrant replacement for M shows\nthat (X0 , X1 )(X) \u2192 M(X) is injective on morphisms and isomorphism classes.\n3. Representable Morphisms\nWe begin by giving a definition of representable morphism in P (C, Grpd) generalizing the one for stacks in [DM, Definition 4.2] 1. Classically the definition of\nrepresentable morphism applies only to maps between stacks, for which the following two notions agree (by Lemma 2.2).\nDefinition 3.1. A morphism M \u2192 N \u2208 P (C, Grpd) is called\n\u2022 strongly representable if for each X \u2208 C and each map X \u2192 N, the\nhomotopy fiber product X \u00d7hN M is levelwise weakly equivalent to a representable presheaf.\n\u2022 representable if for each X \u2208 C and each map X \u2192 N, the homotopy\nfiber product X \u00d7hN M is weakly equivalent to a representable presheaf.\nNote 3.2. Note the following easy consequence of the homotopy invariance of the\nhomotopy pullback: If f and g are weakly equivalent morphisms in P (C, Grpd)L ,\n(i.e. there exist \u03b1, \u03b2 weak equivalences such that \u03b1\u25e6f = g\u25e6\u03b2) then f is representable\nif and only if g is.\nRepresentability allows one to extend certain properties of morphisms in C to\narbitrary presheaves of groupoids.\nDefinition 3.3. Let P be a property of morphisms in C 2. We say f : M \u2192 N\nsatisfies property P if for all maps X \u2192 N with X \u2208 C, the map X \u00d7hN M \u2192 X is\nweakly equivalent to a map in C which satisfies property P.\nSimilarly, a collection {Ui \u2192 N} is a cover if for each X \u2192 M with X \u2208 C,\n{Ui \u00d7hN X \u2192 X} is weakly equivalent to a cover in C.\nNotice that if f satisfies property P as above then it is necessarily representable.\nGiven a presheaf of groupoids F recall that \u03c00 F is the presheaf of groupoids\ndefined by (\u03c00 F )(X) = \u03c00 (F (X)).\nProposition 3.4. A map f : M \u2192 N \u2208 P (C, Grpd) is representable iff any fibration\np : M\u2032 \u2192 N\u2032 weakly equivalent to f is strongly representable. In that case, for each\nmap X \u2192 M, (the sheaf ) \u03c00 (X \u00d7M M\u2032 ) is isomorphic to a representable.\n1 In [LM-B, 3.9] for C = Aff\n\u00e9tale such morphisms are called schematic.\n2In the usual definition it is also required that P is local on the target and stable under\n\npullback (as in Definition 4.2). If P is not stable under pullback then property P for representable\nfunctors will be a stablized version of the origianl property. For our purposes neither of these\nextra requirement makes a difference.\n\n\f6\n\nSHARON HOLLANDER\n\nProof. If p is strongly representable, f is obviously representable. For the converse\nnote that since p is a fibration, given X \u2192 N\u2032 , X \u00d7N\u2032 M\u2032 is levelwise weakly equivalent to the homotopy fiber product X \u00d7hN\u2032 M\u2032 , which is by assumption weakly\nequivalent to a representable. Now X \u00d7N\u2032 M\u2032 \u2192 X is a fibration, representables are fibrant and weak equivalences between fibrant objects are levelwise weak\nequivalences. Hence X \u00d7hN M is levelwise weakly equivalent to a representable.\nThe second statement is clear.\n\u0003\nNote 3.5. The previous lemma shows that a map f : M \u2192 N is representable iff\nthe associated map of stacks is strongly representable.\n3.1. Generalized algebraic stacks. In this section we define the concept of a\ngeneralized algebraic presheaf of groupoids. We first recall the definition of algebraic\nstack which appears in [DM, 4.6]. This is usually called a Deligne-Mumford stack\nand we follow suite. We also recall the weakening of this which is usually called an\nalgebraic stack [LM-B, 4.1]3.\nDefinition 3.6. Let S be a scheme and let C be the category of S-schemes in the\n\u00e9tale topology. A stack M is called a Deligne-Mumford (resp. algebraic) stack if\nthe diagonal M \u2192 M \u00d7 M is representable, separated and quasi-compact and if it\nadmits an \u00e9tale (resp. smooth) cover X \u2192 M with X \u2208 C.\nDefinition 3.7. Let C be a site. We say that M \u2208 P (C, Grpd) is generalized\nalgebraic if its diagonal is representable and there is a cover X \u2192 M with X \u2208 C.\nNote 3.8. The condition that the diagonal of M be representable is equivalent to\nthe requirement that for all X \u2192 M, Y \u2192 M, with X, Y \u2208 C the product X \u00d7hM Y\nis weakly equivalent to a representable.\nLemma 3.9. The definition of generalized algebraic is invariant under weak equivalence. Thus a presheaf of groupoids is generalized algebraic if and only if its stackification is generalized algebraic.\nProof. If X \u2192 M is a cover and N \u2192 M is a weak equivalence, the local lifting\nconditions 1.2 provide a cover of N.\n\u0003\n4. Characterization of the generalized algebraic stacks\nIn this section we give a homotopy theoretic characterization of generalized algebraic stacks (Theorem 4.3). For this we will need the following definition which\ngeneralizes faithfully flat descent of morphisms [SGA, Theorem VIII.2.1].\nDefinition 4.1. Given a site C consider the presheaf of groupoids on C defined on\nobjects by X 7\u2192 iso(C/X) and on morphisms via pullback. We say that the site C\nsatisfies descent for morphisms if this is a stack.\nDefinition 4.2. We say that a topology on C is local if the notion of cover is local\non the target. This means that if {Ui \u2192 X} is a cover and {Vj \u2192 X} is a collection\nof morphisms such that {Vj \u00d7X Ui \u2192 Ui } is a cover for each i then {Vk \u2192 X} is\nalso a cover.\n3Note that the definitions in [LM-B] use a weakened form of representability which only requires\nthat the pullback be an algebraic space.\n\n\fCHARACTERIZING ALGEBRAIC STACKS\n\n7\n\nTheorem 4.3. Let C be a site which is local and satisfies descent for morphisms.\nThen M is a generalized algebraic presheaf of groupoids if and only if M is weakly\nequivalent in P (C, Grpd)L to a groupoid object (Xo , Xm ) in C, for which the domain\nmap Xm \u2192 Xo is a cover.\nThe proof is broken down into the following two propositions.\nProposition 4.4. Let M be a generalized algebraic presheaf of groupoids and X \u2192\nM be a cover (in the sense of Definition 3.3) with X \u2208 C. Let Xm denote the\nrepresentable weakly equivalent to X \u00d7hM X. Then the pair (X, Xm ) is a groupoid\nobject in C and the natural map (X, Xm ) \u2192 M is a weak equivalence.\nProof. It suffices to prove this for M a stack. Given a generalized algebraic presheaf\nof groupoids there exists a representable morphism X \u2192 M which is a cover. Let\n\u223c\nX \u2212\u2192 X\u0303 \u0589 M be a factorization as a trivial cofibration followed by a fibration,\nand let X\u0303\u2022 denote the nerve of this cover.\nX\u0303 \u00d7M X is levelwise weakly equivalent to a representable Xm and Xm \u2192 X is\na cover. Since (X\u0303, X\u0303 \u00d7M X\u0303) is a groupoid object in the homotopy category so is\n(X, Xm ), and as X and Xm are both fibrant, cofibrant, and discrete (X, Xm ) is\nalso a groupoid object in P (C, Grpd) and in C.\nNext we show that the map (X, Xm ) = |(X, Xm )\u2022 | \u2192 M is a weak equivalence\nby verifying that it satisfies the local lifting conditions. The first of the local lifting\nconditions follows from the fact that X \u2192 M is a cover. By Remark 2.5 the map\n(X, Xm ) \u2192 M is levelwise equivalent to the inclusion of a full subcategory and so\nthe second of the local lifting conditions is also satisfied (even not locally).\n\u0003\nProposition 4.5. Let C be a site which is local and satisfies descent for morphisms.\nIf (Xo , Xm ) is a groupoid object in C, with Xm \u2192 Xo a cover then the associated\nstack M(Xo ,Xm ) is generalized algebraic.\nProof. First we will show that under these hypothesis Xo \u2192 M = M(Xo ,Xm ) is\nrepresentable.\nLet Y \u2208 C and Y \u2192 M be a map in P (C, Grpd). Since Xo \u2192 M is locally\nsurjective there is a cover U \u2192 Y for which we have the following factorization\nU \u00d7\u001f Y U\n\u001f\n\u001f\u000f\nXm\n\n+3 U\n\u001f\n\u001f\n\u001f\u000f\n+3 Xo\n\n/Y\n\u000f\n/M\n\nBy construction of the homotopy fiber product we obtain a simplicial diagram of\nfibrations U\u2022 \u00d7hM Xo \u0589 U\u2022 augmented by Y \u00d7hM X0 \u0589 Y . Notice that besides\nY \u00d7hM Xo all of the fiber products (U \u00d7Y U * * * \u00d7 YU ) \u00d7hM Xo are levelwise weakly\nequivalent to representables, for example\n\u223c\n\nU \u00d7hM Xo = U \u00d7Xo Xo \u00d7hM Xo \u2212\u2192 U \u00d7Xo Xm .\n\u223c\n\nFix V \u2208 C and \u03b1 : U \u00d7hM Xo \u2212\u2192 V , and let \u1fb1 be the induced isomorphism\n\u223c\n=\n\u03c00 (U \u00d7hM Xo ) \u2212\u2192 V . Let pr1 , pr2 denote the projections U \u00d7Y U \u2192 U . It follows\nthat we have weak equivalences\npr \u2217 \u1fb1\n\ni\n\u03c00 (U \u00d7Y U \u00d7hM Xo ) \u2212\u2192\npri\u2217 V,\n\n\f8\n\nSHARON HOLLANDER\n\nand so we obtain an isomorphism over U \u00d7Y U ,\n[(pr2\u2217 \u1fb1)\u22121 \u25e6 pr1\u2217 \u1fb1] : pr1\u2217 V \u2192 pr2\u2217 V\nThe simplicial identities imply that this isomorphism satisfies the hypothesis for\ndescent for morphisms, which implies that there exists V \u2032 \u2192 Y \u2208 C together with\nan isomorphism V \u223c\n= V \u2032 \u00d7Y U making the following diagram commute\nU \u00d7Y U \u00d7Y U \u00d7hM Xo\n\n_*4 U \u00d7Y U \u00d7h Xo\nM\n\n\u223c\n\n+3 U \u00d7h Xo\nM\n\n\u223c\n\n\u000f\n\n/ Y \u00d7 h Xo\nM\n\n\u223c\n\nU \u00d7Y U \u00d7Y U \u00d7Y V \u2032\n\n\u000f\n_*4 U \u00d7Y U \u00d7Y V \u2032\n\n+3 U \u00d7Y V \u2032\n\n/ V\u2032\n\n\u000f\nU \u00d7Y U \u00d7Y U\n\n\u000f\n_*4 U \u00d7Y U\n\n\u000f\n+3 U\n\n\u000f \u007f\n/Y\n\n\u000f\n\nIt follows that V \u2032 is weakly equivalent to\n\u223c\n\n\u223c\n\n|U\u2022 \u00d7Y V \u2032 | \u2190\u2212 |U\u2022 \u00d7M Xo | \u2212\u2192 Y \u00d7hM Xo .\nEssentially the same argument implies that the diagonal M \u2192 M \u00d7 M is representable.\nTo see that Xo \u2192 M is a cover, consider the pullback square\nU \u00d7Y V \u2032 \u223c\n= U \u00d7Xo Xm\n\n/ V\u2032 \u223c\n= Y \u00d7hM Xo\n\n\u000f\nU\n\n\u000f\n/ Y.\n\nThe bottom horizontal arrow and left vertical one are covers since Xm \u2192 Xo is a\ncover. Since the topology on C is local V \u2032 \u2192 Y is a cover.\n\u0003\nBy [SGA, Expos\u00e9 IX], we have the following corollary.\nCorollary 4.6. Let C = Schemes in the \u00e9tale topology. Then M is a DeligneMumford stack in the sense of [DM, Definition 4.6] 4 if and only if it is weakly\nequivalent to a groupoid object (Xo , Xm ) in C, with Xm \u2192 Xo a cover.\nThe flat topology on affine schemes satisfies descent for morphisms by [SGA,\nTheorem VIII.2.1] so we have the following corollary.\nCorollary 4.7. Let C = Affine schemes in the flat topology. The generalized algebraic stacks are those stacks which are weakly equivalent to flat Hopf algebroids.\nAppendix A. Topologies on a stack\nWe define two new sites Rep/M and P (C, Grpd)/M associated to a presheaf\nof groupoids M. We show that if M is a generalized algebraic stack then the\ncategory of sheaves Sh(Rep/M) agrees with the usual category of sheaves on M. In\naddition we prove a comparison theorem explaining the relation between Rep/M\nand P (C, Grpd)/M.\n4In geometric situations it is usually also required that the diagonal of M be quasi-compact\nand separated.\n\n\fCHARACTERIZING ALGEBRAIC STACKS\n\n9\n\nA.1. The site C/M. In this section we recall a site canonically associated to a\npresheaf of groupoids M first considered in [DM, Definition 4.10].\nDefinition A.1. Let M be in P (C, Grpd) and let C/M denote the site whose\nf\n\n\u2022 objects are pairs (X, f ), where X \u2208 C and X \u2212\u2192 M,\nf\n\ng\n\nh\n\n\u2022 morphisms from X \u2212\u2192 M to X \u2032 \u2212\u2192 M are pairs (h, \u03b1) where X \u2212\u2192 X \u2032\nand \u03b1 is a homotopy f \u2192 g \u25e6 h,\n\u2022 covers are collections of morphisms which forget to covers in C.\nFor a proof that this defines a Grothendieck topology see [H2, Section 2.1].\nRemark A.2. Given maps f, f \u2032 : X \u2192 M a homotopy \u03b1 : f \u2192 f \u2032 determines an\nisomorphism in C/M between the objects f and f \u2032 . So a presheaf F on C/M will\nsatisfy F (X, f ) \u223c\n= F (X, f \u2032 ). The category C/M is just the Grothendieck construction on the functor M.\nRemark A.3. Definition A.1 generalizes the \u00e9tale site [DM, 4.10] of a DeligneMumford stack which is the site defined above for C the category of schemes and\n\u00e9tale maps in the \u00e9tale topology. However, there is no site C which gives rise via\nA.1 to the smooth-\u00e9tale site [LM-B, 12.1] of an algebraic stack M. For example, if\nwe take M to be a scheme, the smooth-\u00e9tale site is not the over category of M in\nsome category of schemes which are the only kind of sites which arise via A.1.\nA.2. The site Rep/M. The concept of representable morphism allows us to extend\nin a natural way the notion of cover to presheaves of groupoids and so gives rise to\nthe following site.\nDefinition A.4. For M in P (C, Grpd) the site Rep/M has\n\u2022 Objects: strongly representable morphisms N \u0589 M,\nf2\nf1\n\u2022 Morphisms from N1 \u2212\u2192 M to N2 \u2212\u2192 M consist of pairs (g, \u03b1) with g :\nN1 \u2192 N2 and \u03b1 a homotopy f1 \u2192 f2 \u25e6 g.\nui\nN} such that the ui are strongly\n\u2022 Covers: collections of morphisms {Ni \u2212\u2192\nrepresentable and for each X \u2192 N, X \u2208 C the collection {X \u00d7hN Ni \u2192 X}\nis weakly equivalent to a cover in C.\nNote that the pullback in Rep/M is exactly the homotopy fiber product of Definition 2.1. It is also true that homotopy equivalences are isomorphisms in Rep/M.\nThe proof that Rep/M is a site is parallel to that for C/M.\nProposition A.5. Let M be a generalized algebraic stack then the category of\nsheaves on Rep/M is equivalent to the category of sheaves on the site C/M.\nProof. Since M is a generalized algebraic stack, C/M embeds in Rep/M as a full\nsubcategory. By [Ta, Proposition 3.9.1] it is enough to see that any object in Rep/M\nis covered by an object in C/M.\nGiven an object f : N \u2192 M in Rep/M, and a cover X \u2192 M with X \u2208 C, X \u00d7hM N\nis levelwise weakly equivalent to a representable Z \u223c\n= \u03c00 (X \u00d7hM N). The quotient\nmap p : X \u00d7hM N \u2192 Z is a trivial fibration and Z is cofibrant so p is a homotopy\nequivalence and hence an isomorphism in Rep/M. It follows that Z \u2192 X \u00d7hM N \u2192 N\nis a cover in Rep/M.\n\u0003\nNote A.6. One can make a definition analogous to Definition A.4 using the concept\nof representable instead of strongly representable morphism, but then the result of\n\n\f10\n\nSHARON HOLLANDER\n\nthe previous proposition would not hold as local weak equivalences would not be\nisomorphisms in the category.\nRemark A.7. Let {fi : Ui \u2192 N} be a collection of representable morphisms and\n{f \u0303i : \u0168i \u0589 N} be the family of fibrations obtained by functorial factorization in\nP (C, Grpd)L . Then the following are equivalent:\n(i) The collection {fi : Ui \u2192 N} is a cover in the sense of Definition 3.3.\n(ii) The collection {f \u0303i : \u0168i \u0589 N} is a cover in Rep/M.\nA.3. The site P (C, Grpd)/M. We now define a site associated to M which is very\nnatural from the point of view of homotopy theory and compare it to the ones\ndiscussed above.\nTheorem A.8. Let C be a site and M \u2208 P (C, Grpd)L . Then there is a Grothendieck\ntopology on P (C, Grpd)L /M in which the covers are the sets of morphisms {Ui \u2192 N}\nwhich satisfy:\n\u2022 Ui \u0589 N are fibrations,\n\u2022 |U\u2022 | \u2192 N is a weak equivalence.\n`\nProof. First we prove that pullbacks of covers`are covers. Let Ui \u2192 N be a cover\nand M \u2192 N a morphism. The morphism\nUi \u2192 N is an objectwise fibration\nand so the induced map |U\u2022 | \u2192 N is also an objectwise fibration. As geometric\nrealization commutes with fiber products, |U\u2022 | \u00d7N M \u223c\n= |U\u2022 \u00d7N M| and so we have\na pullback square\n/ |U\u2022 |\n|U\u2022 \u00d7N M|\n\u000f\n\u000f\n/N\nM\nwhere the right vertical map is an objectwise fibration and a weak equivalence.\nBy [H, Corollary 5.8] the pullback of a weak equivalence which is an objectwise\nfibration is a weak equivalence.\nTo see that covers compose, let {Vij \u2192 Ui } be covers of each Ui . The iterated\nfiber products of the covers {Vij \u2192 Ui } form a bisimplicial object V\u2022,\u2022 augmented\nover U\u2022 . The columns Vn,\u2022 are iterated fiber products of the nerves of {Vij \u2192 Ui }\nand therefore the map induced by the augmentation\n|V\u2022,\u2022 | \u2192 |U\u2022 | \u2192 N\nis a weak equivalence. The geometric realization of the bisimplicial object is equivalent to the geometric realization of its diagonal, so | diag V\u2022,\u2022 | \u2192 N is a weak\nequivalence.\nThe nerve of the cover {Vij \u2192 N} is the 0-th row V\u2022,0 Since V\u2022,0 is a 0-coskeleton\nover N, there is a retraction to the canonical map V\u2022,0 \u2192 diag V\u2022,\u2022 over N (see [DHI,\nProposition A4]) and therefore V\u2022,0 \u2192 N is a weak equivalence.\n\u0003\nProposition A.9. Given a collection {fi : Ui \u0589 N} in P (C, Grpd)/M the following\nare equivalent:\n(i) The collection {fi : Ui \u0589 N} is a cover in P (C, Grpd)/M.\n(ii) For each X \u2192 N the collection {Ui \u00d7N X \u0589 X} is a cover in P (C, Grpd)/M.\n(iii) For each X \u2192 N the union of the images of Ui \u00d7N X \u0589 X is a covering sieve\nof X in C.\n\n\fCHARACTERIZING ALGEBRAIC STACKS\n\n11\n\nProof. The fact that (i) implies (ii) is a part of the axioms for a topology. First we\nprove that that (ii) implies (i). Given X \u2208 C, and X \u2192 N, let W denote |U\u2022 |, then\nthe projection map W \u00d7N X \u2192 X is a weak equivalence since\nW \u00d7N X \u223c\n= |U\u2022 \u00d7N X| \u223c\n= |(U \u00d7N X)\u2022 |,\nso this map is the induced map to X from the nerve of the cover Ui \u00d7N X \u2192 X.\nSimilarly, given any map X \u2297 \u22061 \u2192 N the pullback (X \u2297 \u22061 ) \u00d7N W \u2192 X \u2297 \u22061\nis a weak equivalence since in the diagram\nW \u00d7N X\n\n/ W \u00d7N (X \u2297 \u22061 )\n\n/W\n\n\u000f\n/ X \u2297 \u22061\n\n\u000f\n/N\n\n\u223c\n\n\u000f\nX\n\n\u223c\n\nthe top left map is a levelwise weak equivalence (because W \u2192 N is a levelwise\nfibration and Grpd is right proper). It is now straightforward to check that W \u2192 N\nis a weak equivalence using the local lifting conditions 1.2.\nTo see that (ii) implies (iii) let {Ui \u0589 X} be a cover in P (C, Grpd)/M and let F\nbe any sheaf on C. F is a discrete stack and so\n\u223c\nM ap(X, F ) \u2212\u2192 holim M ap(U\u2022 , F ) \u223c\n= lim M ap(U\u2022 , F ) \u223c\n= M ap(colim \u03c00 U\u2022 , F )\n`\n`\nwhich shows that X is the coequalizer of the sheafification ( \u03c00 Uij \u21d2 \u03c00 Ui ),\nso by [MM, Corollary III.7.7] the union of the images of \u03c00 Ui \u2192 X is a covering\nsieve in C.\nConversely\nsuppose that {Ui \u0589 X} generates a covering sieve. This means that\n`\nsh( \u03c00 Ui ) \u2192 X is a surjection of sheaves, from which it follows that colim \u03c00 U\u2022 \u2192\nX is a weak equivalence. Since U\u2022 is a 0-coskeleton in simplicial objects over X\nthe projection |U\u2022 | \u2192 colim \u03c00 U\u2022 is a levelwise weak equivalence. It follows that\n{Ui \u0589 X} is a cover in P (C, Grpd)/M.\n\u0003\nHere is the relation between the notion of cover on P (C, Grpd)/M just defined\nwith the ones defined previously.\nCorollary A.10. Let {fi : Ui \u2192 N} be a collection of representable morphisms and\n{f \u0303i : \u0168i \u0589 N} be fibrations obtained by functorial factorization in P (C, Grpd)L .\n(1) If {fi : Ui \u2192 N} is a cover in the sense of Definition 3.3, then {f \u0303i : \u0168i \u0589 N}\nis a cover in P (C, Grpd)/M.\n(2) Conversely, if {f \u0303i : \u0168i \u0589 N} is a cover in P (C, Grpd)/M then for each\nX \u2192 N the collection {Ui \u00d7hN X \u2192 X} determine a covering sieve in C.\nLet Sh(M) be the category of sheaves on P (C, Grpd)L /M which take weak equivalences to isomorphisms. The above Corollary implies that we have a surjective\nrestriction functor Sh(M) \u2192 Sh(C/M).\nReferences\nBry.\n\nJ.-L.
